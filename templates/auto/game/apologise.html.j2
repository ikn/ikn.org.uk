<p>This is a game I made for <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> 22, which took place in December 2011.  You play as a person-thing who kills anyone that gets near (he's cursed or something).  Controls and other details are in the included readme.</p>
<p>If you have trouble seeing the dark levels, try turning up your screen backlight.  Oh, and I know the sounds are painful if you're using headphones: unfortunately, I didn't realise it in time for the competition (fixed in the updated version).</p>
