<p>A puzzle platformer made for <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> 25 (December 2012), which had the theme 'you are the villain'.  In this game, you're infiltrating some bad guy's warehouse, and can change clothes to look like him using wardrobes inside; doing so stops the guard robots from chasing you.</p>
