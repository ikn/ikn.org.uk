<p>pacman-expire-cache is a tool for deleting old cached package files for the <i>pacman</i> package manager.  Existing cache cleaners generally offer the ability to retain the latest X versions of each package, or of each installed package.  This is not useful in the following cases:
<ul>
    <li>a package has been broken for a while, but not used recently, and has been updated many times recently, such that you only notice the issue once all working versions have been deleted</li>
    <li>a package has been accidentally removed, and then an update pushed which breaks it</li>
</ul>
<p>pacman-expire-cache solves these issues by allowing you to retain, independently:
<ul>
    <li>package files newer than X days</li>
    <li>the latest Y versions for each installed package</li>
    <li>the latest Z versions for each not-installed package</li>
</ul>
