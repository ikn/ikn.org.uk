<p>Farragone is a GUI batch file renamer for those who understand regular expressions, glob-style patterns and maybe a little scripting.  The idea is to create a simple workflow based on a few flexible components - as opposed to the standard approach, which appears to be to define hundreds of presets, and if you're lucky one of those will be what you're looking for.</p>
