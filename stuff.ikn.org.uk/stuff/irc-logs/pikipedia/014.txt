2015-05-31 12:35:52	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-05-31 12:35:53	Testyo	they're not TOO flashy
2015-05-31 12:38:13	@Espyo	hey
2015-05-31 12:39:47	@J	way too flashy
2015-05-31 13:48:26	@Espyo	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJOw6phpVKA I REALLY wish I could understand what he's doing
2015-05-31 13:49:54	@Espyo	oh, I think I get it
2015-05-31 13:54:02	Yoshi2	alright, so this is really annoying me right now
2015-05-31 13:54:10	Yoshi2	I'm setting up shared memory like this: http://pastebin.com/9x4KkjMu
2015-05-31 13:54:26	Yoshi2	but all the stuff my child processes do in the shared memory is completely ignored
2015-05-31 13:56:28	@Espyo	ah processes...
2015-05-31 13:56:32	@Espyo	the headaches...
2015-05-31 13:56:37	@Espyo	can't you use threads instead?
2015-05-31 13:57:08	Yoshi2	we are supposed to use fork and shared memory and semaphores 
2015-05-31 13:57:10	Yoshi2	yay for homework
2015-05-31 13:57:27	@J	ignored?
2015-05-31 13:58:06	@Espyo	ah nuts
2015-05-31 13:58:31	Yoshi2	J: indeed, it seems as if only the changes the parent process does stick
2015-05-31 13:59:08	@J	you mean the child can read back its changes, but the parent can't see them?
2015-05-31 13:59:13	@J	or even the child can't see its changes?
2015-05-31 14:00:50	@Espyo	I think it's more like the children can't write
2015-05-31 14:00:51	@Espyo	only read
2015-05-31 14:01:31	Yoshi2	the children can read, and do changes, but the changes only carry on to the children of the children
2015-05-31 14:02:17	Yoshi2	the parent does not see any of the changes the children have done
2015-05-31 14:02:38	Yoshi2	if it's any help, here is the part of the code where I use the shared memory: http://pastebin.com/zAfQJm5y
2015-05-31 14:03:25	Yoshi2	it's a parallelized implementation of quicksort for sorting strings from a file
2015-05-31 14:05:37	@J	you're calling parallel_sort from multiple processes?
2015-05-31 14:07:04	Yoshi2	parallel_sort is called once, which starts parallel_quicksort, and parallel_quicksort calls itself recursively after forking
2015-05-31 14:08:40	@J	so the child does nothing right now?
2015-05-31 14:08:57	@J	oh, never mind
2015-05-31 14:10:08	Yoshi2	the child calls parallel_quicksort and then exits
2015-05-31 14:11:08	Yoshi2	I am considering continuing work as if it worked correctly, and then ask my tutor about it
2015-05-31 14:11:35	@J	I don't see where you're mapping the memory on the child
2015-05-31 14:12:36	Yoshi2	should I map it in the child again?
2015-05-31 14:12:42	@J	also you don't assign any memory for the 'children' pointer
2015-05-31 14:13:24	@J	well, I've never done this before, but I get the impression you need to actually open the shared memory object in every process
2015-05-31 14:14:47	@J	you need to run shm_open without O_CREAT in the child then mmap, I guess
2015-05-31 14:16:11	Yoshi2	that does sound like it's worth giving a try
2015-05-31 14:16:40	@J	I guess you've done multiprocessing in Python where you can just use all the variables in the current scope from the parent and it just magically works
2015-05-31 14:17:18	@J	AFAIK in C, you shouldn't use _any_ data that was defined or memory that was allocated in the parent
2015-05-31 14:18:06	Yoshi2	as far as I can tell, when forking, the child and the parent are pretty much the same in terms of what data they have
2015-05-31 14:21:58	Yoshi2	in linux, the parent and the child even operate in the same space until the child changes something. Then the child receives its own space somewhere else, but the data for that is copied from the parent
2015-05-31 14:22:36	@J	right, which is exactly your problem, isn't it?
2015-05-31 14:24:40	@J	I don't know, I might be making stuff up

2015-05-31 15:00:15	Yoshi2	if that does end up being my issue, then I will have to rething the way I think about child processes and shared memory

2015-05-31 15:23:15	Yoshi2	alright, so I changed the thing so it mmap's stuff in the child processes
2015-05-31 15:23:22	Yoshi2	output is the same
2015-05-31 15:26:31	@J	oh well
2015-05-31 15:27:08	@J	you probably have some minor mistake somewhere
2015-05-31 15:28:49	Yoshi2	that minor mistake has been a major pain in the butt
2015-05-31 15:29:10	Yoshi2	I've sent the code to a friend of mine who (hopefuly) has worked on the task too, let's see what he has to say
2015-05-31 15:30:25	@J	when this sort of thing happens, I generally try to write the basic part that's not working in as little code as possible
2015-05-31 15:30:30	@J	then add stuff until it breaks
2015-05-31 15:32:14	Yoshi2	for the most part, I've pinned the issue down

2015-05-31 15:33:03	Yoshi2	the issue is some sort of misunderstanding of shared memory on my part, and I need to find it and fix it
2015-05-31 15:33:20	Yoshi2	the "add stuff until it breaks" thing doesn't work very well if the code doesn't break
2015-05-31 15:34:39	@J	what do you mean, it doesn't break?
2015-05-31 15:35:13	Yoshi2	no segfaults, no crashes
2015-05-31 15:35:22	Yoshi2	it just doesn't sort the input correctly
2015-05-31 15:35:25	@J	by 'break', I mean 'not do the right thing'
2015-05-31 15:35:46	@J	your issue was that child processes writing to memory don't affect the memory read by the parent
2015-05-31 15:36:03	@J	just a working version of that is probably 20 lines, really simple

2015-06-01 18:54:02	Testyo	amazing
2015-06-01 18:54:10	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2015-06-01 19:00:35	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-01 19:01:16	@J	amazing indeed
2015-06-01 19:02:41	@Espyo	mhm
2015-06-01 19:02:57	Yoshi2	J: so that issue from yesterday was caused by a swap function which was given to us that I used
2015-06-01 19:03:24	Yoshi2	instead of swapping two pointers, the function swapped the content of two strings
2015-06-01 19:03:45	Yoshi2	now, I only had the pointers in the shared memory, but the actual content was not in the shared memory
2015-06-01 19:04:52	Yoshi2	and you already know the rest of the story
2015-06-01 19:07:39	Yoshi2	What do we learn from this? Never trust the code given to you :V
2015-06-01 19:09:42	Yoshi2	but it does make me rather furious that I spent an entire day on an issue caused by a single function
2015-06-01 19:49:42	@J	does sharing pointers between processes even work?
2015-06-01 19:54:08	Yoshi2	well, I can share the pointer values between processes through the shared memory thing
2015-06-01 19:54:38	Yoshi2	but it is kinda weird that the child processes can access the data the pointers point to
2015-06-01 19:57:29	Yoshi2	it would mean that the child processes could peek into the first parent process that started it all
2015-06-01 19:57:34	Yoshi2	without causing a segfault
2015-06-01 20:02:17	@J	okay, 'explosive' is not something you want sauce to be
2015-06-01 20:05:58	Yoshi2	explosive sauce sounds interesting
2015-06-01 20:07:49	@J	no
2015-06-01 20:08:44	Yoshi2	booom

2015-06-03 22:05:19	@PikFan	it would be super convenient if MediaWiki could let you delete an account
2015-06-03 22:05:28	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-06-03 22:05:47	@PikFan	I did some looking around, and apparently there's an extension for that
2015-06-03 22:05:58	@PikFan	though it doesn't delete accounts, but merges them

2015-06-03 23:07:30	En_Passant	Now I do, so Porple will delete the new account so Dry can be renamed and I can keep my edit count

2015-06-03 23:18:56	@PikFan	I think it's related to the fatal error thing

2015-06-04 00:09:28	@PikFan	have you noticed my organizing the categories?
2015-06-04 00:09:55	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-06-04 00:10:05	En_Passant	This was more for cleaning up pages, though
2015-06-04 00:10:12	@PikFan	right, I know
2015-06-04 00:10:35	@PikFan	but I feel like part of the reason why we have such a hard time to getting around to cleaning the pages is lack of structure
2015-06-04 00:10:55	@PikFan	sure, the pages need cleaning
2015-06-04 00:10:59	@PikFan	that's a given
2015-06-04 00:11:09	@PikFan	but we also need some sort of framework to do it
2015-06-04 00:11:15	@PikFan	and we don't have that
2015-06-04 00:14:05	@PikFan	ooh, so I had an idea for infoboxes
2015-06-04 00:14:41	@PikFan	so for like enemies, it lists the areas where the enemies occur
2015-06-04 00:14:46	@PikFan	right now, there's no order
2015-06-04 00:14:50	@PikFan	BUT
2015-06-04 00:15:24	@PikFan	if we use the <br> tag and the show/hide feature, we could easily condense and organize the info
2015-06-04 00:19:02	En_Passant	We have something like a structure
2015-06-04 00:19:04	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Talk:Project_Clean_Up
2015-06-04 00:19:15	En_Passant	Peach and I had a discussion about it a long time ago
2015-06-04 00:20:00	En_Passant	Oh yeah, we were waiting for Espyo to greenlight the project
2015-06-04 00:20:31	@PikFan	I thought he did already
2015-06-04 00:21:16	En_Passant	He hadn't written anything in the discussion
2015-06-04 00:21:17	@PikFan	hey, if you want to, go ahead and organize Orange Pikmin
2015-06-04 00:21:24	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 00:21:52	@PikFan	well, I think it should be fine, with or without his input
2015-06-04 00:22:00	@PikFan	your plan does seem pretty solid
2015-06-04 00:22:10	@PikFan	and besides, he'd probably agree
2015-06-04 00:22:26	@PikFan	holy crap September 2014
2015-06-04 00:22:31	@PikFan	...was it really that long ago?
2015-06-04 00:22:32	@PikFan	wow
2015-06-04 00:22:55	@PikFan	9 months later...
2015-06-04 00:23:03	@PikFan	time has certainly flown
2015-06-04 00:23:04	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-06-04 00:23:13	En_Passant	I got busy after that and forgot about it
2015-06-04 00:23:26	@PikFan	I see
2015-06-04 00:28:25	En_Passant	I don't think we need the Sandbox pages, as the layout has been generally agreed upon
2015-06-04 00:28:29	En_Passant	I don't know why Peach made those
2015-06-04 00:28:46	En_Passant	But I would wait just a little bit while I copy what's in Sandbox 1 to the appropriate pages
2015-06-04 00:30:05	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 00:30:51	En_Passant	I hope I don't get in trouble for making such huge structural changes since I'm not an admin
2015-06-04 00:30:53	@PikFan	just to let you know, I'm going to be leaving soon
2015-06-04 00:31:00	@PikFan	oh, don't worry about it
2015-06-04 00:31:01	En_Passant	Okay
2015-06-04 00:31:11	@PikFan	you've got my approval so it's fine
2015-06-04 00:31:46	@PikFan	Peach and Espyo are the only other activeish admins
2015-06-04 00:31:54	En_Passant	It'll require a lot of page deletion once I'm done, though
2015-06-04 00:32:02	En_Passant	Since all of the individual pages will be obsoleted
2015-06-04 00:32:11	@PikFan	hmm, okay
2015-06-04 00:32:38	@PikFan	if I don't delete them within the first few days, mark them with {{delete}} so they do get deleted eventually
2015-06-04 00:32:55	@PikFan	actually, just put {{delete}} on them
2015-06-04 00:33:35	En_Passant	Okay
2015-06-04 00:33:41	@PikFan	hey, so how's Pikmin V going?
2015-06-04 00:33:51	En_Passant	It's okay
2015-06-04 00:34:08	En_Passant	Kind of just making treasures and enemies at this point
2015-06-04 00:34:10	@PikFan	not to get off-topic or anything, just curious because I like where the game idea is going
2015-06-04 00:34:13	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-06-04 00:34:30	En_Passant	I'm trying to decide how Polar Mountain should be designed as well
2015-06-04 00:34:37	@PikFan	yes...
2015-06-04 00:34:41	@PikFan	the eternal struggle
2015-06-04 00:34:50	En_Passant	Not sure how I can tie in the latter two areas to real-life stuff
2015-06-04 00:34:54	@PikFan	heh
2015-06-04 00:35:08	En_Passant	Because White-Out Zone definitely won't be on top of an actual mountain
2015-06-04 00:35:24	@PikFan	is it going to be a tundra or something like that?
2015-06-04 00:35:58	En_Passant	Do you know what a white-out is?
2015-06-04 00:36:09	@PikFan	a blizzard?
2015-06-04 00:36:57	En_Passant	Kind of. As the name implies, everything appears white
2015-06-04 00:37:03	En_Passant	It becomes hard to distinguish anything
2015-06-04 00:37:09	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 00:37:12	En_Passant	Never experienced one myself
2015-06-04 00:37:19	@PikFan	same
2015-06-04 00:37:28	En_Passant	Just thought it'd be a cool level design
2015-06-04 00:37:36	En_Passant	But I dunno, maybe I'll change it
2015-06-04 00:38:09	@PikFan	your call
2015-06-04 00:47:55	En_Passant	What do you think of what I have so far?
2015-06-04 00:47:55	@PikFan	of your game, or of the cleanup?
2015-06-04 00:47:55	En_Passant	My game
2015-06-04 00:47:55	@PikFan	oh
2015-06-04 00:47:56	@PikFan	I definitely like the regions concept
2015-06-04 00:47:56	@PikFan	it's an original idea
2015-06-04 00:47:56	@PikFan	I also think it's cool how there are P3-style and P2-style bosses
2015-06-04 00:47:56	@PikFan	it incorporates the mechanics from both games nicely

2015-06-04 00:48:34	@PikFan	so far, I like the enemies names, too
2015-06-04 00:48:45	En_Passant	All two of them, lol
2015-06-04 00:48:49	@PikFan	yep
2015-06-04 00:48:53	En_Passant	I have more
2015-06-04 00:48:58	En_Passant	But they're not on the site
2015-06-04 00:49:02	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 00:49:14	@PikFan	but yeah, most enemies are recolors, sadly
2015-06-04 00:49:34	En_Passant	I want to finish making all of the enemies and them add them all at once
2015-06-04 00:49:49	@PikFan	I see
2015-06-04 00:49:53	En_Passant	And yeah, most of our contributors are pre-teens without much creativity
2015-06-04 00:50:07	@PikFan	I'm 15, lol
2015-06-04 00:50:34	@PikFan	I started editing back when I was 11
2015-06-04 00:50:46	@PikFan	a lot has happened in the 4 years that I've been on the wiki
2015-06-04 00:50:56	@PikFan	I've matured quite a bit in that time, too
2015-06-04 00:51:57	@PikFan	I was given adminship very early on because I impressed the admins with the quality of my work
2015-06-04 00:52:24	@PikFan	however, I soon was revoked of it, because... well, I kinda bullied a user :x
2015-06-04 00:52:43	@PikFan	so I had it taken away and nearly left
2015-06-04 00:53:03	@PikFan	but after that incident I became more mature, more respectful of others
2015-06-04 00:53:33	@PikFan	I gained the admins' trust again, and was promoted to admin, then to bureaucrat
2015-06-04 00:53:48	@PikFan	I've been a bureaucrat for nearly 3 years
2015-06-04 00:54:31	@PikFan	I'm sorry, have I made you lost? lol
2015-06-04 00:54:56	@PikFan	...I went into a whole spiel of my wiki-life, heh
2015-06-04 00:55:03	En_Passant	No, it's fine
2015-06-04 00:55:12	En_Passant	I like learning about other people
2015-06-04 00:55:18	@PikFan	ah
2015-06-04 00:55:22	En_Passant	I can't say I have any stories about myself, though
2015-06-04 00:55:35	@PikFan	it's okay
2015-06-04 00:55:44	@PikFan	you'll make your own
2015-06-04 00:56:11	@PikFan	but yeah, I've tried to make my game detailed
2015-06-04 00:56:36	En_Passant	Which one? You have two
2015-06-04 00:56:50	@PikFan	Connection of the Worlds
2015-06-04 00:57:29	@PikFan	the only reason why End of Time exists is because I hated having only just one game
2015-06-04 00:57:49	@PikFan	it's kinda sad, really
2015-06-04 00:57:57	@PikFan	I need to get around to developing that
2015-06-04 00:58:24	@PikFan	...like I've said about many things, but ended up never doing :|
2015-06-04 00:58:36	@PikFan	don't we just love procrastination
2015-06-04 00:58:45	En_Passant	Yeah, I have so many unfinished projects
2015-06-04 00:59:00	@PikFan	mm
2015-06-04 00:59:01	En_Passant	Making games is my hobby, and I have partially done ones for at least 5 series
2015-06-04 00:59:21	@PikFan	I see
2015-06-04 01:00:22	@PikFan	heck, I even wrote on my userpage "...I probably will never finish these games"
2015-06-04 01:00:42	@PikFan	mainly due to procrastination, yes
2015-06-04 01:01:01	@PikFan	but also the fact that if I come up with a new idea, I can just go back and add it
2015-06-04 01:01:16	@PikFan	it isn't set in stone, nor will it ever be
2015-06-04 01:01:39	@PikFan	unless I make an actual, real life game about it (SUPER likely)
2015-06-04 01:09:58	En_Passant	So, back to Pikmin V, do you think I have a balanced Pikmin variety?
2015-06-04 01:11:55	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-04 01:11:59	@PikFan	seems balanced
2015-06-04 01:13:34	En_Passant	Do you think the Pikmin 3 nerfs are good?
2015-06-04 01:13:45	@PikFan	which ones?
2015-06-04 01:14:08	@PikFan	I didn't like them getting rid of blues saving drowning Pikmin
2015-06-04 01:14:29	En_Passant	I mean the nerfs to the Rock and Winged Pikmin in Pikmin V
2015-06-04 01:14:30	@PikFan	also, I thought Purples were overly nerfed
2015-06-04 01:14:36	@PikFan	oh
2015-06-04 01:15:05	En_Passant	I was also wondering if Purples and Whites are balanced enough
2015-06-04 01:16:25	@PikFan	most of it is alright
2015-06-04 01:16:38	@PikFan	I'm just not sure about the wind resistance bit
2015-06-04 01:17:03	En_Passant	Really?
2015-06-04 01:17:10	En_Passant	Purples were immune in 2
2015-06-04 01:17:22	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2015-06-04 01:17:28	@PikFan	I meant how I felt about it
2015-06-04 01:17:38	@PikFan	I think I get why you made them not resistant
2015-06-04 01:18:01	En_Passant	Oh, you mean on Purples, not Oranges
2015-06-04 01:18:01	@PikFan	because wind is a unique element, but it doesn't kill, so why bother making them resistant?
2015-06-04 01:18:18	@PikFan	wait, Oranges are resistant to wind?
2015-06-04 01:18:23	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-06-04 01:18:28	@PikFan	oh, never mind then
2015-06-04 01:18:41	En_Passant	I made Purples not resistant because they're big, so there's a lot to be pushed around
2015-06-04 01:19:00	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 01:19:07	En_Passant	 18-wheelers are prone to wind despite their bulk
2015-06-04 01:19:27	@PikFan	I see
2015-06-04 01:19:40	@PikFan	at the same time, they're heavier, though
2015-06-04 01:19:59	@PikFan	eh, Oranges are resistant to wind, so I won't fuss over it
2015-06-04 01:20:23	@PikFan	as for Whites: they're fine
2015-06-04 01:25:06	En_Passant	What do you think of them having Onions now?
2015-06-04 01:25:31	@PikFan	it's fine

2015-06-04 01:27:10	@PikFan	yay
2015-06-04 01:27:13	@PikFan	fatal errors
2015-06-04 01:28:52	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 01:29:02	@PikFan	I think I should get rid of the moon
2015-06-04 01:29:23	@PikFan	the moon will still be there, of course, but I don't think it should be an explorable area
2015-06-04 01:29:56	@PikFan	also, I should merge the Portal and the Garden, and I should redo the Garden
2015-06-04 01:30:07	@PikFan	it should become a more forest-like area
2015-06-04 01:31:05	En_Passant	Uhh
2015-06-04 01:31:22	@PikFan	(talking about PCW)
2015-06-04 01:31:23	En_Passant	So one of the Pikmin pages that's been renovated/obsoleted was featured
2015-06-04 01:31:29	En_Passant	What should I do?
2015-06-04 01:31:33	En_Passant	(I know)
2015-06-04 01:31:42	@PikFan	oh uh
2015-06-04 01:31:43	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 01:31:49	@PikFan	is it Orange Pikmin?
2015-06-04 01:33:19	En_Passant	It's the Pikmin Choronicles version
2015-06-04 01:33:25	@PikFan	oh
2015-06-04 01:33:29	En_Passant	Which somehow got featured despite not spelling Chronicles correctly
2015-06-04 01:34:39	@PikFan	Featured Pikmin is a very outdated thing
2015-06-04 01:35:02	@PikFan	it's been out of use for years and I don't think anyone cares about it anymore
2015-06-04 01:36:15	@PikFan	yeah, 3 years
2015-06-04 01:36:21	@PikFan	just ignore it
2015-06-04 01:36:31	@PikFan	well, actually
2015-06-04 01:37:06	@PikFan	are you turning that page into a section of another pages?
2015-06-04 01:37:07	@PikFan	*page
2015-06-04 01:38:30	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-06-04 01:38:38	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 01:38:48	@PikFan	alright, here's what you do:
2015-06-04 01:39:14	@PikFan	just move the Featured Pikmin template and put it there
2015-06-04 01:39:43	@PikFan	I'll work out the details later; I'll make a page for old featured article systems
2015-06-04 01:41:08	En_Passant	Okay
2015-06-04 01:42:21	En_Passant	So here's what I've got:
2015-06-04 01:42:26	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Orange_Pikmin_(explosives)
2015-06-04 01:42:41	En_Passant	Aw, the explosives part didn't make it into the URL
2015-06-04 01:43:01	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Category:Pikmin_Family
2015-06-04 01:43:21	En_Passant	Go here instead, and find the Orange Pikmin pageswith descriptions in parentheses after the name
2015-06-04 01:43:29	@PikFan	okay
2015-06-04 01:45:19	@PikFan	so you've got explosives, spiky, sand immune, parasitic, and miscellaneous?
2015-06-04 01:45:25	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-06-04 01:45:29	@PikFan	alright
2015-06-04 01:45:30	En_Passant	Those are the ones I found
2015-06-04 01:45:45	En_Passant	The plan is to turn the original Orange Pikmin page into a disambiguation
2015-06-04 01:45:52	@PikFan	mhm
2015-06-04 01:45:57	En_Passant	And I guess the current disambiguation page would be unnecessary
2015-06-04 01:46:03	@PikFan	right, yes
2015-06-04 01:46:08	@PikFan	I'll delete it
2015-06-04 01:46:12	En_Passant	Cool
2015-06-04 01:46:35	@PikFan	though we shouldn't have disambig in the title, though
2015-06-04 01:46:47	@PikFan	it should just be "Orange Pikmin"
2015-06-04 01:47:02	@PikFan	...hmmm...
2015-06-04 01:47:19	@PikFan	ugh, linking is going to be a pain
2015-06-04 01:47:48	En_Passant	Yeah, that's what I mean
2015-06-04 01:48:00	@PikFan	well, drat
2015-06-04 01:48:05	@PikFan	uh
2015-06-04 01:48:17	@PikFan	can I ask a favor of you?
2015-06-04 01:48:27	En_Passant	The page titled "Orange Pikmin" explains that there are many types, see them on such and such page, etc.
2015-06-04 01:48:31	En_Passant	Yeah, sure
2015-06-04 01:48:35	@PikFan	alright
2015-06-04 01:49:10	@PikFan	could you merge all the types into one page? keep the individual types, but have them as header 1 sections
2015-06-04 01:49:28	@PikFan	like =Explosive=, then the explosive types would go there, etc
2015-06-04 01:49:53	@PikFan	that way we won't have all these parentheses in the page titles
2015-06-04 01:49:58	En_Passant	I could, yeah
2015-06-04 01:50:05	En_Passant	That's how the Sandbox page was organized
2015-06-04 01:50:05	@PikFan	I should have realized this earlier
2015-06-04 01:50:10	@PikFan	...oh
2015-06-04 01:50:28	 *	@PikFan facepalms at self's silliness
2015-06-04 01:50:36	En_Passant	And it was in the discussion before we decided on having the pages lol
2015-06-04 01:50:48	@PikFan	alright, I'm stupid
2015-06-04 01:50:53	En_Passant	I explained the pros and cons of different organizations
2015-06-04 01:50:55	@PikFan	so yeah, go ahead and do that
2015-06-04 01:51:14	En_Passant	We figured having them on different pages would keep the Orange Pikmin page from being super long
2015-06-04 01:51:39	@PikFan	eh, it shouldn't get TOO long
2015-06-04 01:52:00	En_Passant	And, now that I think about it, it also prevents lazy editors who tack their games to the bottom from screwing up too much
2015-06-04 01:52:16	@PikFan	Orange Pikmin is only the 89th longest page on the wiki
2015-06-04 01:52:17	En_Passant	I dunno, the original Orange Pikmin page is pretty f-ed up
2015-06-04 01:52:54	@PikFan	make it clear at the top that if they want to add a new type, they need to categorize it according to the types
2015-06-04 01:53:23	En_Passant	That wouldn't stop them
2015-06-04 01:53:33	En_Passant	We have policies about editing that nobody follows already lol
2015-06-04 01:53:51	@PikFan	...true
2015-06-04 01:54:08	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Talk:Project_Clean_Up
2015-06-04 01:54:10	En_Passant	Here
2015-06-04 01:54:22	En_Passant	The first thing on the page discusses how we should organize it
2015-06-04 01:54:23	@PikFan	alright, keep the individual pages for now
2015-06-04 01:54:58	@PikFan	if linking becomes too much of an issue, we'll recombine them into one page
2015-06-04 01:55:27	@PikFan	although...
2015-06-04 01:55:34	En_Passant	Oh, by linking, you mean links from the game pages to the Pikmin page
2015-06-04 01:55:42	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-04 01:56:02	@PikFan	I could have Espyo cook up a template that would simplify links
2015-06-04 01:56:43	En_Passant	That could work
2015-06-04 01:57:51	@PikFan	for example, say you wanted to link to the explosive Orange Pikmin, to the game Key of Beginnings
2015-06-04 01:58:36	@PikFan	you'd have to write it out as [[Orange Pikmin (explosives)#Pikmin: The Key of Beginnings|Orange Pikmin]]
2015-06-04 01:58:50	@PikFan	that's way too long for anybody to comfortably write out
2015-06-04 01:58:55	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-06-04 01:59:16	@PikFan	so instead, you do this: {{orange|e|Pikmin: The Key of Beginnings}}
2015-06-04 01:59:30	@PikFan	and it still links to that page, but displays as "Orange Pikmin"
2015-06-04 01:59:57	En_Passant	I guess, but the template would probably start with {{pikmin| to clarify that it is a Pikmin link
2015-06-04 02:00:10	En_Passant	So {{pikmin
2015-06-04 02:00:14	En_Passant	Dangit
2015-06-04 02:00:25	En_Passant	*{{pikmin|color|type|game}}
2015-06-04 02:00:41	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-06-04 02:00:43	En_Passant	With pikmin being static
2015-06-04 02:00:48	@PikFan	right
2015-06-04 02:01:07	@PikFan	I'll have to ask Espyo
2015-06-04 02:01:17	@PikFan	he's much better with templates than I am
2015-06-04 02:04:19	En_Passant	Oh, another thing that could go on the Orange Pikmin page
2015-06-04 02:04:31	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-06-04 02:04:33	En_Passant	A mention of Pikmin which are orange-colored but not called Orange Pikmin specifically
2015-06-04 02:05:23	En_Passant	If there are any
2015-06-04 02:05:35	En_Passant	It'd be more useful on the Black Pikmin page
2015-06-04 02:05:46	En_Passant	But we're using Orange as our example, so might as well
2015-06-04 02:05:49	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 02:05:59	@PikFan	aren't your Clawed Pikmin black?
2015-06-04 02:06:07	En_Passant	Yes
2015-06-04 02:06:12	En_Passant	Which is my point exactly
2015-06-04 02:06:18	En_Passant	They're not the only ones like that
2015-06-04 02:06:22	@PikFan	I see
2015-06-04 02:06:29	@PikFan	yeah, Rocks and Wingeds
2015-06-04 02:07:05	En_Passant	And other fan types, like Assassin Pikmin which are also black
2015-06-04 02:07:11	@PikFan	mhm
2015-06-04 02:07:31	@PikFan	Clawed may be the same color as Black Pikmin, but they're a different type altogether
2015-06-04 02:07:48	En_Passant	Well, kind of
2015-06-04 02:07:58	En_Passant	There's a type of Black Pikmin that's almost identical
2015-06-04 02:08:09	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Black_Pikmin_(Sticky)
2015-06-04 02:08:46	En_Passant	Though that page will be repurposed for the project since it has sticky in the title
2015-06-04 02:08:55	@PikFan	right
2015-06-04 02:09:26	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-04 02:09:54	@PikFan	I'd say that if they don't have "Black" in their name, we should keep them separate
2015-06-04 02:10:12	@PikFan	we can mention that they are black colored, yes
2015-06-04 02:10:19	@PikFan	but are distinct from Black Pikmin
2015-06-04 02:10:25	En_Passant	That's what I was saying
2015-06-04 02:10:35	@PikFan	...oh
2015-06-04 02:10:37	@PikFan	guh
2015-06-04 02:10:54	@PikFan	18:04	En_Passant	A mention of Pikmin which are orange-colored but not called Orange Pikmin specifically
2015-06-04 02:11:04	@PikFan	now I understand what you meant by that
2015-06-04 02:19:02	En_Passant	Oh, never mind, a lowercase s is counted as a different page

2015-06-04 19:04:28	Testyo	and I think there's no
2015-06-04 19:07:33	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-04 19:21:28	@Espyo	so I uploaded Pikan to the wiki
2015-06-04 19:21:31	@Espyo	screw making the code better
2015-06-04 19:21:37	@Espyo	I just cannot handle Javascript's sass
2015-06-04 19:21:53	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Espyo/Pikan
2015-06-04 19:22:03	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Espyo/pikan.js it's kinda weird that this page is being categorized, thoguh
2015-06-04 19:22:05	@Espyo	*though
2015-06-04 19:26:15	@J	no news item?
2015-06-04 19:29:22	@Espyo	it's not on common.js
2015-06-04 19:29:29	@Espyo	gonna try it elsewhere real quick
2015-06-04 19:29:35	@Espyo	and wait for you super quick peer review
2015-06-04 19:29:40	@Espyo	which I know you can't resist doing
2015-06-04 19:29:41	@J	oh, okay
2015-06-04 19:30:10	@J	well then the info page should probably have instructions on setting it up, if you want others to use it
2015-06-04 19:30:27	@Espyo	on other wikis?
2015-06-04 19:30:36	@J	even on Pikipedia
2015-06-04 19:30:44	@Espyo	I thought the plan was to have it run on common.js
2015-06-04 19:30:45	@Espyo	for everybody
2015-06-04 19:30:50	@J	oh, yeah
2015-06-04 19:31:06	@J	okay, so you don't really intend others to use it until it's there
2015-06-04 19:31:19	@J	got it, wasn't sure how long you were thinking until doing that
2015-06-04 19:31:29	@Espyo	right
2015-06-04 19:31:34	@Espyo	though I should still explain how to add it on other wikis
2015-06-04 19:31:53	@J	you kind of did
2015-06-04 19:32:10	@Espyo	just kind of
2015-06-04 19:32:29	@Espyo	I was thinking more along the lines of the part where you have to add the include to a subpage under your user name
2015-06-04 19:33:20	@J	but if someone's going to have to edit the JS to get it to work anyway, chances are they know how to set it up
2015-06-04 19:35:07	@Espyo	hm, you're right
2015-06-04 19:39:14	@Espyo	so I finished Link's Awakening today
2015-06-04 19:39:17	@Espyo	it's a really good game
2015-06-04 19:39:35	@Espyo	it's one of those games that left me with a feeling of happiness just because I played it

2015-06-04 19:44:03	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-04 19:44:05	@Espyo	nope
2015-06-04 19:45:46	En_Passant	So the deal is, we've gone through with that old plan for cleaning up the wiki
2015-06-04 19:45:52	En_Passant	Or, the Pikmin, at least
2015-06-04 19:45:56	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-06-04 19:45:59	@Espyo	how's that going?
2015-06-04 19:46:27	En_Passant	I got Black, Green, Orange, and Brown Pikmin done
2015-06-04 19:46:31	En_Passant	Those were the big ones
2015-06-04 19:46:49	En_Passant	There are a couple of types that I'm not sure what to do, though
2015-06-04 19:46:52	@J	I never played any 2D Zelda games
2015-06-04 19:47:39	En_Passant	For example, Gray/Grey Pikmin, which have appeared in 8 games with different abilities in every one
2015-06-04 19:47:54	En_Passant	So they can't really be categorized by ability
2015-06-04 19:48:11	@Espyo	the 2D Zeldas have a really big charm to them
2015-06-04 19:48:23	@Espyo	hmm... yeah
2015-06-04 19:48:31	@Espyo	you might just have to go with two different article styles
2015-06-04 19:49:27	En_Passant	Yeah, ALBW was really fun. A tad easy
2015-06-04 19:50:07	En_Passant	That's actually a really good idea, Espyo
2015-06-04 19:50:22	UltraMario	ive played a little of zelda 1, a little of zelda 2 if you consider that a "2d" zelda game, half of lttp, some of la, beat four swords, played a bit ph, none of spirit tracks, and beat half of albw
2015-06-04 19:50:24	UltraMario	oh yeah
2015-06-04 19:50:32	UltraMario	and played up to the first world in fsa
2015-06-04 19:50:41	UltraMario	never played the oracle games\
2015-06-04 19:50:47	@Espyo	Zelda 2 is probably the most 2D, heh
2015-06-04 19:51:14	UltraMario	lol
2015-06-04 19:51:23	UltraMario	and the first 2 cdi games
2015-06-04 19:51:55	En_Passant	But we don't speak of those
2015-06-04 19:52:16	UltraMario	they're still sidescrollers like zelda 2

2015-06-04 20:22:58	@Espyo	we snatched it quite cleanly

2015-06-04 20:23:30	@Espyo	jpmrocks from Pikipedia was the one to approach the Splatoon wikia folk with a move
2015-06-04 20:23:44	@Espyo	I assisted by convincing them to join, and later, by taking care of the backend things

2015-06-04 20:24:01	@Espyo	it's still on wikia because we can't remove it... but it's pretty much moved

2015-06-04 20:24:52	@Espyo	they loved both the freedom to implement their own style, and the freedom to add their own addons
2015-06-04 20:25:03	@Espyo	yeah, but it's looking like it's Japan only

2015-06-04 20:26:14	@Espyo	because they won't throw away a cash cow
2015-06-04 20:26:16	@Espyo	it's not that tiny
2015-06-04 20:26:19	UltraMario	it doesn't say anthing about squid girl on that link
2015-06-04 20:26:25	@PikFan	well, it's tiny for now
2015-06-04 20:26:27	@Espyo	Pikmin wikia is like 1/10th, and it's still sort of big

2015-06-04 20:27:54	Yoshi2	wooohooo
2015-06-04 20:27:56	UltraMario	wait espyo
2015-06-04 20:27:59	UltraMario	splatoon forums
2015-06-04 20:28:04	UltraMario	you mean squidboards?
2015-06-04 20:28:09	@PikFan	we should try getting WiKirby and Kirby Wikia to merge
2015-06-04 20:28:16	@Espyo	squidboards, yep
2015-06-04 20:28:18	UltraMario	per pikfan
2015-06-04 20:28:26	@Espyo	might be a lot more difficult
2015-06-04 20:28:27	UltraMario	that way wikirby won't suck
2015-06-04 20:28:28	UltraMario	:P
2015-06-04 20:28:31	@Espyo	Kirby's already so established...
2015-06-04 20:28:36	UltraMario	but
2015-06-04 20:28:38	UltraMario	wikirby sux
2015-06-04 20:28:58	@PikFan	true
2015-06-04 20:29:00	UltraMario	:p
2015-06-04 20:29:07	En_Passant	While we're throwing out mergers, maybe Nookipedia and Animal Crossing Wikia?
2015-06-04 20:29:12	UltraMario	eh
2015-06-04 20:29:14	UltraMario	i dunno
2015-06-04 20:29:15	En_Passant	Nook's not bad, but AC is better
2015-06-04 20:29:15	@PikFan	...all this talk of wikia is distracting me from reading features of Pikan
2015-06-04 20:29:25	UltraMario	nookipedia seems to be better than acwikia from what i've seen
2015-06-04 20:29:31	@Espyo	okay, added
2015-06-04 20:29:33	@Espyo	it should be working
2015-06-04 20:29:36	UltraMario	added what
2015-06-04 20:29:49	@Espyo	Pikan
2015-06-04 20:30:04	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=10-day_run&action=edit do you guys see anything?
2015-06-04 20:30:06	@Espyo	try ctrl+f5
2015-06-04 20:30:21	@Espyo	oh, wait
2015-06-04 20:30:23	@Espyo	it's giving an error
2015-06-04 20:30:24	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-06-04 20:30:51	En_Passant	It loads for me
2015-06-04 20:31:10	@PikFan	okay, so how do I use Pikan?
2015-06-04 20:31:18	@PikFan	do I just c+p it into my .js?
2015-06-04 20:31:46	En_Passant	What's Pikan?
2015-06-04 20:31:52	@J	Espyo just added it to common.js, but it's not working quite yet
2015-06-04 20:32:08	@Espyo	it should be global, PikFan
2015-06-04 20:32:11	UltraMario	pikan is pikfan without an f
2015-06-04 20:32:12	UltraMario	;)
2015-06-04 20:32:15	@Espyo	I mean, everybody should see it
2015-06-04 20:32:18	@Espyo	even anons
2015-06-04 20:32:19	@Espyo	but something's not quite right
2015-06-04 20:33:10	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2015-06-04 20:33:37	@PikFan	so yesterday, on Fanon, En Passant and I decided to split the Orange Pikmin page
2015-06-04 20:33:51	@Espyo	he said
2015-06-04 20:33:59	@PikFan	mm
2015-06-04 20:34:29	@PikFan	we realized that linking to a specific game would be horrendous, so we were wondering if you could make a template for that
2015-06-04 20:35:04	En_Passant	Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that part
2015-06-04 20:35:37	En_Passant	I did Black, Brown, and Green too, by the way
2015-06-04 20:35:46	@PikFan	we thought the template would go something like: {{<Pikmin type>|<subpage>|<game>|<text to be displayed as>}}
2015-06-04 20:35:47	Testyo	"<Pikmin_type>|<subpage>|<game>|<text_to_be_displayed_as>" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:<Pikmin_type>|<subpage>|<game>|<text_to_be_displayed_as>
2015-06-04 20:36:22	@PikFan	it would be the same as using a normal link, yes...
2015-06-04 20:36:27	@Espyo	hmm
2015-06-04 20:36:32	@Espyo	give me an example usage
2015-06-04 20:36:36	@Espyo	you may wanna use pastebin
2015-06-04 20:36:45	@PikFan	but we thought that we could abbreviate the subpage to just one letter
2015-06-04 20:38:04	@PikFan	{{Pikmin|orange|e|Pikmin: The Key of Beginnings}}
2015-06-04 20:38:04	Testyo	"Pikmin|orange|e|Pikmin:_The_Key_of_Beginnings" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Pikmin|orange|e|Pikmin:_The_Key_of_Beginnings
2015-06-04 20:38:14	@Espyo	oh! I think it's working now
2015-06-04 20:38:16	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Child_of_the_Earth&action=edit
2015-06-04 20:38:23	@Espyo	again, try ctrl+f5 if you don't see it
2015-06-04 20:38:41	@PikFan	(actually, the text to be displayed as thing is an alternate text; it defaults as "Orange Pikmin"
2015-06-04 20:39:02	@Espyo	I'm really confused, I don't have any context
2015-06-04 20:39:13	@PikFan	okay, so
2015-06-04 20:39:48	@PikFan	say that you wanted to link to the Pikmin: The Key of Beginnings version of Orange Pikmin
2015-06-04 20:40:01	@PikFan	and you wanted the link to display as "Orange Pikmin"
2015-06-04 20:40:09	@PikFan	you'd have to write it as [[Orange Pikmin (explosives)#Pikmin: The Key of Beginnings|Orange Pikmin]]
2015-06-04 20:40:09	Testyo	"Orange_Pikmin_(explosives)#Pikmin:_The_Key_of_Beginnings|Orange_Pikmin" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Orange_Pikmin_(explosives)#Pikmin:_The_Key_of_Beginnings|Orange_Pikmin
2015-06-04 20:40:23	@PikFan	and that link is too long for anybody to write comfortably
2015-06-04 20:40:27	@Espyo	right
2015-06-04 20:40:42	@PikFan	so we thought that if we had a template to do it, it'd be easier
2015-06-04 20:41:09	@Espyo	okay
2015-06-04 20:41:21	@PikFan	so we came up with this: {{Pikmin|orange|e|Pikmin: The Key of Beginnings}}
2015-06-04 20:41:21	Testyo	"Pikmin|orange|e|Pikmin:_The_Key_of_Beginnings" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Pikmin|orange|e|Pikmin:_The_Key_of_Beginnings
2015-06-04 20:41:28	@Espyo	yeah, I see
2015-06-04 20:41:32	@Espyo	should be easy
2015-06-04 20:41:34	@Espyo	want me to do it then?
2015-06-04 20:41:41	@PikFan	do you understand what the parameters mean?
2015-06-04 20:41:46	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-04 20:41:49	@PikFan	okay
2015-06-04 20:42:03	@PikFan	for the third parameter, we thought we should just abbreviate each type
2015-06-04 20:42:16	En_Passant	One letter probably isn't a good idea
2015-06-04 20:42:23	@PikFan	maybe
2015-06-04 20:42:24	En_Passant	Because some categories are very similar
2015-06-04 20:42:34	@PikFan	two, three letters?
2015-06-04 20:42:35	En_Passant	Like the sticky and sticky resistant Black Pikmin types
2015-06-04 20:42:43	@Espyo	it probably works by shortening as much as possible
2015-06-04 20:42:53	@Espyo	|s| and |sr|
2015-06-04 20:43:17	@Espyo	or you could have it like
2015-06-04 20:43:39	@Espyo	{{pik|PTKoB Orange}}
2015-06-04 20:43:39	Testyo	"pik|PTKoB_Orange" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:pik|PTKoB_Orange
2015-06-04 20:43:43	@Espyo	and then a huge list with all combinations
2015-06-04 20:43:51	@Espyo	pro: people don't have to memorize what page it's on
2015-06-04 20:43:54	@Espyo	nor write the whole game name
2015-06-04 20:44:06	@Espyo	cons: every new game maker would have to add their Pikmin to the template's list
2015-06-04 20:44:25	@Espyo	I suggest you guys make every game use an acronym as an ID
2015-06-04 20:44:34	@Espyo	and whenever stuff like this is needed, you can use the ID instead of a long name
2015-06-04 20:44:38	@Espyo	find some policy for it
2015-06-04 20:44:45	@PikFan	what about sections that aren't games?
2015-06-04 20:44:50	@Espyo	like "if there's a clash, the first game gets the acronym, the second gets a different one"
2015-06-04 20:44:55	En_Passant	There shouldn't be any
2015-06-04 20:44:57	@Espyo	how so?
2015-06-04 20:45:18	@Espyo	yeah, there shouldn't be any
2015-06-04 20:45:20	@PikFan	because I was thinking that this could be applied to many other pages
2015-06-04 20:45:35	En_Passant	This specific template's for the Pikmin, isn't it?
2015-06-04 20:45:44	@PikFan	the first section could be written as 1, next section as 2, etc
2015-06-04 20:45:55	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-06-04 20:46:02	@PikFan	okay, let's just stick with Pikmin
2015-06-04 20:46:11	@PikFan	Espyo: Pikan's not appearing
2015-06-04 20:46:17	@Espyo	ctrl+f5?
2015-06-04 20:46:46	@PikFan	er, I'm using a mac, so I don't know what the equivalent combo is
2015-06-04 20:47:35	En_Passant	Seriously, what's Pikan
2015-06-04 20:48:05	Yoshi2	pikipedia analyzer
2015-06-04 20:48:05	@Espyo	cmd+f5
2015-06-04 20:48:26	@PikFan	...it gives me something called voice over
2015-06-04 20:48:49	@PikFan	is it a refresh?
2015-06-04 20:48:56	@PikFan	that is, the command
2015-06-04 20:49:15	@Espyo	it is
2015-06-04 20:49:18	@Espyo	but it skips the cache
2015-06-04 20:49:32	@Espyo	hold shift and press the refresh button on the toolbar?
2015-06-04 20:49:39	@Espyo	or hold command and press the toolbar button
2015-06-04 20:50:14	@PikFan	nope, nothing
2015-06-04 20:50:17	@Espyo	I see Pikan on my tablet
2015-06-04 20:50:20	@PikFan	not seeing it
2015-06-04 20:50:23	@PikFan	>tablet
2015-06-04 20:50:39	@PikFan	bleh, I'll look when I get home
2015-06-04 20:50:50	@Espyo	do command + r
2015-06-04 20:50:52	@Espyo	says the internet
2015-06-04 20:51:08	@PikFan	still nothing
2015-06-04 20:51:15	@Espyo	you're on an edit page, right?
2015-06-04 20:51:18	@PikFan	mhm
2015-06-04 20:51:33	@PikFan	what's the button look like?
2015-06-04 20:51:50	@Espyo	a button with an arrow circling clockwise
2015-06-04 20:52:03	@Espyo	it could be a safari-exclusive error
2015-06-04 20:52:22	@Espyo	 Open Safari and choose Safari > Preferences > Advanced. Then select Show Develop menu in menu bar.
2015-06-04 20:52:22	@Espyo	Choose Develop > Show Error Console.
2015-06-04 20:52:42	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-04 20:53:41	@Espyo	I can see it on my tablet with both Chrome and Firefox
2015-06-04 20:53:45	@Espyo	both logged in and not
2015-06-04 20:53:54	@PikFan	well, it's a school computer, so I don't want to tamper with anything
2015-06-04 20:53:55	@Espyo	either your browser isn't really refreshing the cache
2015-06-04 20:54:01	@PikFan	like I said, I'll look when I get home
2015-06-04 20:54:02	@Espyo	or it's a safari bug
2015-06-04 20:54:04	@Espyo	hm, right
2015-06-04 20:54:09	@Espyo	well, there's one last quick thing you can try
2015-06-04 20:54:13	@Espyo	close it down and open it again :|

2015-06-05 20:20:10	@PikFan	so I've got finals next week
2015-06-05 20:20:13	@PikFan	should be fun
2015-06-05 20:20:15	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2015-06-05 20:20:19	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-05 20:20:21	Yoshi2	oOoO, good luck
2015-06-05 20:20:23	@Espyo	hm, finals
2015-06-05 20:20:24	@Espyo	good luck
2015-06-05 20:20:29	@PikFan	science and math final
2015-06-05 20:20:37	@PikFan	the science should be a 1 day thing
2015-06-05 20:20:40	@PikFan	math is 2 days
2015-06-05 20:20:54	@PikFan	not sure if I'm going to have finals in other classes
2015-06-05 20:21:19	@PikFan	though I do have two papers to write
2015-06-05 20:21:30	@PikFan	...one of which I've been holding off for weeks
2015-06-05 20:21:35	@PikFan	*putting off
2015-06-05 20:21:43	@PikFan	where did I get holding off
2015-06-05 20:22:29	@PikFan	anyway, so if you haven't noticed already, I got confused about the game icon reports
2015-06-05 20:22:56	@PikFan	but I still think that it should report only if there are no game icons
2015-06-05 20:23:07	@PikFan	because we can make them using the infoboxes
2015-06-05 20:23:08	@Espyo	it can't know
2015-06-05 20:23:14	@PikFan	really?
2015-06-05 20:23:26	@PikFan	it can't search for a game icon parameter?
2015-06-05 20:23:59	@Espyo	it does that
2015-06-05 20:24:05	@Espyo	if it finds {{game icons}}, it shuts up
2015-06-05 20:24:06	Testyo	"game_icons" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game_icons
2015-06-05 20:24:07	@Espyo	if not, it reports
2015-06-05 20:24:12	@Espyo	it can't know that a template already includes it
2015-06-05 20:24:24	@PikFan	how come?
2015-06-05 20:24:37	@Espyo	it reads what you read on the textbox
2015-06-05 20:24:53	@Espyo	{{infobox enemy| bla bla }} The bla bla is a bla bla.
2015-06-05 20:24:53	Testyo	"infobox_enemy|_bla_bla_" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:infobox_enemy|_bla_bla_
2015-06-05 20:24:55	@Espyo	this is what it reads
2015-06-05 20:25:00	@Espyo	it doesn't find any "{{game icons}}" in that text
2015-06-05 20:25:01	Testyo	"game_icons" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game_icons
2015-06-05 20:25:04	@Espyo	so as far as it knows, it's not there
2015-06-05 20:25:32	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-06-05 20:26:00	@PikFan	but if you make |pikmin = y, that makes a game icon
2015-06-05 20:26:11	@Espyo	still
2015-06-05 20:26:15	@Espyo	all it sees is a |pikmin = y
2015-06-05 20:26:36	@PikFan	can't you write it into the code that that means a game icon appears?
2015-06-05 20:26:38	@Espyo	I COULD make it so that it knows that a |pikmin = y, on the infobox enemy template, means an icon is there
2015-06-05 20:26:43	@Espyo	but I'd have to add that for every parameter
2015-06-05 20:26:45	@Espyo	for every infobox
2015-06-05 20:26:49	@Espyo	and update it every time a new infobox came out
2015-06-05 20:26:53	@Espyo	or got removed
2015-06-05 20:26:54	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-06-05 20:27:02	@Espyo	so... let's just leave it as a question
2015-06-05 20:27:10	@PikFan	fair enough
2015-06-05 20:27:24	@PikFan	or until better code comes out
2015-06-05 20:27:38	@PikFan	I really should learn how to program
2015-06-05 20:29:37	@PikFan	oh
2015-06-05 20:29:44	@PikFan	so I had some ideas about my fangame
2015-06-05 20:30:02	@PikFan	I was thinking about redoing the Garden and turning it into more of a forest-like area
2015-06-05 20:30:15	@Espyo	hmm
2015-06-05 20:30:17	@Espyo	classic forest
2015-06-05 20:30:24	@PikFan	and I'd merge the Portal and the Garden into one area
2015-06-05 20:30:35	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User:Piktoad by Piktoad (+4 m He he, Pikan is pretty funny... My user page has 47 problems.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Piktoad&curid=18158&diff=150067&oldid=149404
2015-06-05 20:30:42	@PikFan	also, I should get rid of the Moon as an explorable area
2015-06-05 20:31:00	@PikFan	the final dungeon is there
2015-06-05 20:31:23	@PikFan	so the Portal would end up becoming like the cave entrance, and the final dungeon the cave
2015-06-05 20:31:46	@PikFan	thing is, you can go back any time
2015-06-05 20:32:17	@PikFan	really, there only should be six areas
2015-06-05 20:32:38	@PikFan	technically seven, as the final dungeon is kind of a mix between area and dungeon
2015-06-05 20:32:47	@PikFan	but eh, I'll work out those details later
2015-06-05 20:32:59	@Espyo	heh
2015-06-05 20:33:10	@Espyo	hm, sounds good
2015-06-05 20:33:16	@PikFan	also, I was thinking about combining Tan and Brown Pikmin
2015-06-05 20:33:25	@PikFan	because really, how much different is sand from dirt?
2015-06-05 20:33:52	@PikFan	there shouldn't be two Pikmin for two things that are very similar
2015-06-05 20:34:39	@PikFan	also, maybe merge Burgundy and Red Pikmin's abilities
2015-06-05 20:34:46	@PikFan	that way, there'd be only three new types
2015-06-05 20:35:38	@PikFan	I still haven't created [[f:Ancient Valley]] yet
2015-06-05 20:35:38	Testyo	"Ancient_Valley" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Ancient_Valley
2015-06-05 20:35:39	@Espyo	heh yeah
2015-06-05 20:35:56	@PikFan	I started writing it, but that was on the desktop
2015-06-05 20:36:15	@PikFan	I've got a bunch of files about my fangames stuck on the desktop
2015-06-05 20:36:43	@PikFan	I also need to create the rest of the caves
2015-06-05 20:36:49	@PikFan	but guides, ugh
2015-06-05 20:37:51	@PikFan	my game is a lot different now than it was 4 years ago
2015-06-05 20:38:01	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-06-05 20:38:27	@PikFan	if you look at [[f:Rugged Tundra]], and go to the Caves section, you'll see a cave called Trial of Ice
2015-06-05 20:38:28	Testyo	"Rugged_Tundra" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Rugged_Tundra
2015-06-05 20:39:10	@PikFan	I made that cave some time ago
2015-06-05 20:39:21	@PikFan	(well, not made it, but you get what I mean)
2015-06-05 20:39:55	@PikFan	it's only 5 sublevels long, but is quite hard and only Cyan Pikmin can go in
2015-06-05 20:40:16	@PikFan	I wanted to make similarly-themed caves for the other new types of Pikmin, but never got around to doing it
2015-06-05 20:40:43	@PikFan	it was meant to continue the storyline past the final boss
2015-06-05 20:41:20	@PikFan	the adventurer in me craves a story past the final boss
2015-06-05 20:41:39	@PikFan	but how I'm going to do that, I don't know
2015-06-05 20:41:59	@PikFan	I have so many ideas for my game
2015-06-05 20:42:10	@PikFan	I need a notebook to jot all these ideas down
2015-06-05 20:44:55	@Espyo	yep
2015-06-05 20:47:35	@PikFan	and now my friends are bothering me
2015-06-05 20:47:40	@PikFan	yay
2015-06-05 20:52:23	@Espyo	heh
2015-06-05 20:55:04	@PikFan	alright, gotta go

2015-06-06 21:40:38	@PikFan	gah
2015-06-06 21:40:45	@PikFan	so I'm trying to edit my Google name
2015-06-06 21:40:54	@PikFan	I'm trying to change it to PikFan23
2015-06-06 21:41:15	@PikFan	but when I try to, it forces you to have a space in the middle
2015-06-06 21:41:41	@PikFan	not that I'll ever use it, but I'm doing it mainly for youtube
2015-06-06 21:42:03	@PikFan	and I don't understand how users come up with their names
2015-06-06 21:42:29	Yoshi2	PikFan 23
2015-06-06 21:42:38	@PikFan	no, but
2015-06-06 21:42:49	@PikFan	there's users on YT that don't have spaces in their name
2015-06-06 21:42:55	@PikFan	that's what I'm trying to figure out
2015-06-06 21:43:27	Yoshi2	I have a name without a space \o/
2015-06-06 21:44:11	Yoshi2	at one point, Google tried to force G+ onto every youtube user, and they wanted everybody to input their real name
2015-06-06 21:44:20	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-06 21:44:23	@PikFan	hey Espyo
2015-06-06 21:44:42	Yoshi2	eventually, they gave up and I was able to keep my previous name 
2015-06-06 21:45:00	@PikFan	your YT username is just Espyo, and then your google name is whatever your real name is, right?
2015-06-06 21:45:16	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-06 21:45:20	@PikFan	how did you do that?
2015-06-06 21:45:21	@Espyo	srb2Espyo is the channel id
2015-06-06 21:45:25	@Espyo	I have no idea
2015-06-06 21:45:30	@Espyo	I just mashed out of google+ as fast as possible
2015-06-06 21:45:46	@Espyo	oh, do note that I've had srb2Espyo prior to g+
2015-06-06 21:46:28	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-06 21:46:34	@PikFan	maybe that's my problem
2015-06-06 21:46:39	@PikFan	since I use g+
2015-06-06 21:46:44	@PikFan	...thanks, RL friends :|
2015-06-06 21:46:50	Yoshi2	that might be the case
2015-06-06 21:49:02	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-06-06 21:49:12	@PikFan	so I just have to disconnect my YT from g+
2015-06-06 21:49:27	@PikFan	then I can make my YT name whatever I want
2015-06-06 21:50:51	@PikFan	"New channels created with a Google+ page or profile don't have an old username and can't disconnect Google+."
2015-06-06 21:50:52	@PikFan	...
2015-06-06 21:51:00	@PikFan	screw you too, google
2015-06-06 21:54:13	@PikFan	well, I guess that works
2015-06-06 21:54:24	@PikFan	I just made a new channel under my email
2015-06-06 21:59:27	@Espyo	hm
2015-06-06 22:07:03	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds#Pikmin
2015-06-06 22:07:12	@PikFan	a table would be very nice right there
2015-06-06 22:07:46	@PikFan	still debating about merging tans and browns though
2015-06-06 22:08:03	@PikFan	...although...
2015-06-06 22:08:05	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-06 22:08:43	@PikFan	now that I think about it, no Pikmin are discovered in the Distant Desert for Part I of the game
2015-06-06 22:09:26	@PikFan	also, I'm not sure if blues should be found in the Shimmering Lake during the first visit
2015-06-06 22:10:33	@PikFan	ooh
2015-06-06 22:10:49	@PikFan	maybe they could be found at the new forest area
2015-06-06 22:11:04	@PikFan	(I haven't made a name for it yet)
2015-06-06 22:11:48	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-06 22:12:17	@PikFan	if we did this, and also merged tans and browns...
2015-06-06 22:14:42	@PikFan	http://mibpaste.com/O02zKx 
2015-06-06 22:15:14	@PikFan	well, I didn't include the other types because I have to make it non-linear
2015-06-06 22:17:00	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-06-06 22:17:11	@PikFan	the 3 canon games all have something in common:
2015-06-06 22:17:25	@PikFan	at least 1 area with no Pikmin discovered in it
2015-06-06 22:17:36	@PikFan	which is the final area
2015-06-06 22:17:46	@PikFan	Pikmin 1 has two, though
2015-06-06 22:18:55	@PikFan	hmmmm...
2015-06-06 22:20:13	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-06-06 22:20:28	@PikFan	I need to make different paths to places

2015-06-07 16:23:38	Shard1	Hey guys
2015-06-07 16:26:51	Shard1	Am I the only one having Amiibo problems?
2015-06-07 16:27:02	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-07 16:27:03	Yoshi2	good day
2015-06-07 16:27:07	@Espyo	on Splatoon?
2015-06-07 16:27:08	Yoshi2	what kind of Amiibo problems?
2015-06-07 16:27:45	Shard1	The Splatoon ones are my biggest problem
2015-06-07 16:28:14	Shard1	They are practically extinct
2015-06-07 16:28:38	Yoshi2	in that case
2015-06-07 16:28:42	Yoshi2	no, you are not the only one
2015-06-07 16:29:09	Shard1	Apparantly somebody hijacked a truck full of squid amiibo in the UK

2015-06-07 16:34:07	Yoshi2	really?
2015-06-07 16:34:26	Yoshi2	that's crazy
2015-06-07 16:34:45	Yoshi2	I've heard they are pretty rare, but I didn't think anybody would do that
2015-06-07 16:36:34	@Espyo	mhm, that happened some weeks ago
2015-06-07 16:41:08	Shard1	Yeah, and the fact that it didn't have a tracking device or something.
2015-06-07 16:42:01	Shard1	That was just stupid.
2015-06-07 16:42:15	Shard1	I mean, what's the person going to do with all those amiibos and Splatoon copies?
2015-06-07 16:45:48	Shard1	I haven't had this much trouble with Amiibo since Toon Link and Sheik.
2015-06-07 16:49:25	Shard1	Hopefully Olimar and Ganondorf won't be this hard to get.
2015-06-07 16:50:47	Shard1	Anybody else hoping to see Pikmin 4 at E3? I know it probably won't happen, but I can hope.
2015-06-07 16:57:47	Shard1	What are your guys' thoughts on Mario Party 10?

2015-06-07 17:28:06	Yoshi2	Shard1: we can hear you loud and clear
2015-06-07 17:28:53	Shard1	Hopefully anyways. 
2015-06-07 17:34:57	Yoshi2	I wouldn't mind a Pikmin for the 3DS, but I doubt one will be announced for the Wii U
2015-06-07 17:40:15	Yoshi2	I haven't played MP10, or any of the other Mario Party games myself, so I can't say much about that
2015-06-07 17:41:34	Shard1	I haven't played and Mario Party game either, just not into them
2015-06-07 17:47:43	Shard1	Does anybody else here play Hyrule Warriors?
2015-06-07 17:49:24	Yoshi2	it's on my list of games I want to buy (and play)
2015-06-07 17:49:54	Shard1	It'll take a ridiculous amount of time if you want to 100% it
2015-06-07 17:57:38	Yoshi2	I already have a ridiculous amount of games I need to finish
2015-06-07 17:57:49	Shard1	So do I.
2015-06-07 18:00:11	Yoshi2	and let's not even get started on all the shows I want to watch
2015-06-07 18:03:37	Shard1	You mean all the shows I've never heard of because I don't really watch TV?
2015-06-07 18:10:10	Yoshi2	not TV shows
2015-06-07 18:10:18	Yoshi2	mostly anime
2015-06-07 18:11:21	Shard1	Well, I don't watch shows either.
2015-06-07 18:11:57	Yoshi2	if I can't watch it on my computer or phone, I don't watch it

2015-06-07 18:18:40	Shard1	Ooh, music! :)

2015-06-08 22:39:00	@Espyo	so I tried returning to the ISO-as-folder thing in Dolphin
2015-06-08 22:39:05	@Espyo	I remember the problem now
2015-06-08 22:39:07	@Espyo	it just boots as black
2015-06-08 22:39:14	@Espyo	I mean, nothing happens in the game
2015-06-08 22:39:21	@Espyo	although Dolphin claims it runs at 60fps, 100% speed
2015-06-08 22:41:55	@Espyo	wait
2015-06-08 22:41:56	@Espyo	it's working now
2015-06-08 22:42:07	@Espyo	I think I might've tried Pikmin 1's .dol with Pikmin 2's folder
2015-06-08 22:42:24	@Espyo	even though I octople-checked to make sure I WOULDN'T DO THAT
2015-06-08 22:42:53	@Espyo	hm
2015-06-08 22:42:58	@Espyo	it just does not work with Pikmin 2
2015-06-08 22:43:01	@Espyo	fine with P1, though
2015-06-08 22:43:04	@Espyo	or maybe I broke something
2015-06-08 22:44:34	En_Passant	I have no idea
2015-06-08 22:44:47	En_Passant	What I do know is that I've spent way too much drawing drawing a Pikmin
2015-06-08 22:44:51	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-06-08 22:44:53	En_Passant	*time drawing
2015-06-08 22:44:57	@Espyo	never too much time drawing
2015-06-08 22:45:14	En_Passant	six hours?
2015-06-08 22:45:38	En_Passant	I still have the arms, extremities, and leaf/bud/flower to do
2015-06-08 22:46:01	En_Passant	At least I can copy most of it to make Red, Yellow, and Blue
2015-06-08 22:46:12	En_Passant	But then I want to draw the remaining four types plus my two
2015-06-08 22:46:57	En_Passant	So I'll have to do it all over again
2015-06-08 22:47:37	@Espyo	eh, probably still not too much
2015-06-08 22:48:01	En_Passant	I also have no idea how to do the Red Pikmin's nose because I'm bad at shading
2015-06-08 22:48:35	@Espyo	hmm
2015-06-08 22:48:41	@Espyo	google simple cone shades
2015-06-08 22:49:24	En_Passant	Paint.NET might have a gradient for that
2015-06-08 22:49:31	En_Passant	I'll have to check once I get there
2015-06-08 22:50:12	@Espyo	I think it's just a linear gradient
2015-06-08 22:50:19	@Espyo	you just have to crop it in a triangle shape

2015-06-08 23:07:38	@Espyo	because it's working now
2015-06-08 23:09:36	En_Passant	My guess is the former

2015-06-10 22:06:59	@J	I mean, don't they go further than other colours in that case?
2015-06-10 22:07:52	En_Passant	No, because they have the same horizontal speed and running only adds horizontal momentum
2015-06-10 22:08:07	@Espyo	^this, I think
2015-06-10 22:08:10	@Espyo	at least I'm pretty sure
2015-06-10 22:12:30	@J	but if they go higher they're in the air for longer
2015-06-10 22:13:07	@J	not that I was really trying to apply physics to Pikmin, I just thought I remembered it feeling like they went further
2015-06-10 22:16:47	@Espyo	I know what you mean
2015-06-10 22:17:03	@Espyo	but I think vertical speed and horizontal one are independent
2015-06-10 22:18:15	@J	I didn't say they're not
2015-06-10 22:19:43	@J	if you're talking about why they would go further than others when thrown with greater horizontal speed, I would say it's because when you're standing still, distance is limited by the cursor, not by actual horizontal speed
2015-06-10 22:19:56	@J	and in that case you actually throw yellows with _less_ horizontal speed
2015-06-10 22:20:07	@J	except NPC; in that case I have no idea
2015-06-10 22:22:31	@Espyo	hmm
2015-06-10 22:22:42	@Espyo	right, I get what you mean

2015-06-13 15:28:35	@J	turns out you can get _really_ cheap VPSs these days
2015-06-13 15:28:38	@J	like, $5/year
2015-06-13 15:28:39	Testyo	$ 5 = 4.5985 € / £ 3.2495 
2015-06-13 15:29:04	@J	okay, they're not full OSs and they have low resources, but you can still run whatever program you want
2015-06-13 15:29:39	Yoshi2	5 bucks per year?
2015-06-13 15:29:48	Yoshi2	that is a very nice price
2015-06-13 15:30:01	Yoshi2	probably good for running an irc bot
2015-06-13 15:30:07	Yoshi2	*cough* Testyo *cough*
2015-06-13 15:30:08	Testyo	what's the Root ...what
2015-06-13 15:31:47	Yoshi2	but maybe the uptime isn't so good
2015-06-13 15:32:12	Yoshi2	e.g. your instance could be interrupted in favor of others
2015-06-13 15:37:08	@J	quite possibly
2015-06-13 15:37:35	@Espyo	hmmmmm...
2015-06-13 15:39:46	@J	but yeah, if you just want to test stuff, it basically costs nothing
2015-06-13 15:41:19	@J	also http://www.cloudatcost.com/ seems to offer lifetime plans, which is interesting
2015-06-13 15:41:25	@J	as in you pay once then never again
2015-06-13 15:42:10	@J	stated like that it's more like when you buy your own computer - it lasts until the specs are obsolete and you need something more
2015-06-13 15:42:58	Testyo	alright, dreyn
2015-06-13 15:43:54	@J	mhm

2015-06-14 23:47:00	@Espyo	Nintendo can't just KILL hearts, that has to be bound to some years in jail
2015-06-14 23:47:08	@Espyo	I just completed Classic, looking a the image right now

2015-06-16 21:20:14	UltraMario	there are pikmin in this game
2015-06-16 21:20:15	UltraMario	;)
2015-06-16 21:20:16	Yoshi2	Espyo: seems alright
2015-06-16 21:20:39	Yoshi2	though a bit of a bummer that the "hidden information" thing relies on javascript
2015-06-16 21:21:32	Yoshi2	what about using some CSS or similar stuff to make it so the person has to highlight the text to read it?
2015-06-16 21:22:32	Yoshi2	I've seen that in use on tvtropes

2015-06-16 21:49:42	@Espyo	yeah, I thought about that highlight thing as well
2015-06-16 21:49:49	@Espyo	but I was thinking about entire sections
2015-06-16 21:49:56	@Espyo	also on second thought, they'd probably be better shown by default
2015-06-16 21:49:58	@J	what's happening to the existing spoiler box template?
2015-06-16 21:50:05	@Espyo	it'll be the same
2015-06-16 21:50:12	@Espyo	except I'll add a parameter to specify the type of spoilers
2015-06-16 21:50:15	@Espyo	or at least the game
2015-06-16 21:50:27	@J	I mean, why have that _and_ a start/end way of doing it?
2015-06-16 21:50:43	@Espyo	{{spoiler}} is for stuff like the Titan Dweevil article

2015-06-16 21:50:54	@Espyo	the start and end spoilers are for sections
2015-06-16 21:50:58	@J	that's not what I meant by spoiler box
2015-06-16 21:50:59	@Espyo	like Louie's secret on Louie's article
2015-06-16 21:51:04	@J	I forget what it's called
2015-06-16 21:51:08	@Espyo	we have a spoiler BOX template?
2015-06-16 21:51:20	@J	I think so

2015-06-16 21:51:32	@J	or we used to

2015-06-17 21:30:32	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-17 21:30:33	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-06-17 21:30:39	@Espyo	well, I put a spoiler policy
2015-06-17 21:30:52	@Espyo	and now I'm working on improving the page about the Pikmin drawings
2015-06-17 21:30:57	@Espyo	PikFan, what do you know about the drawings?
2015-06-17 21:31:09	@PikFan	that they're hard to find
2015-06-17 21:31:13	@PikFan	and that's about it
2015-06-17 21:31:33	@Espyo	drat
2015-06-17 21:31:45	@PikFan	well, the drawings suggest what kinds of things the Pikmin can do
2015-06-17 21:31:50	@PikFan	...but that's obvious
2015-06-17 21:31:54	@Espyo	we have like 3 of the locations on the wiki that are either all wrong or so ambiguous that they're useless
2015-06-17 21:32:06	@Espyo	and one of the drawings is missing entirely... likely
2015-06-17 21:32:09	@Espyo	there are three per area
2015-06-17 21:32:14	@PikFan	mhm, yes
2015-06-17 21:32:15	@Espyo	except Twilight River, where we only know of 2
2015-06-17 21:32:22	@Espyo	oh, and the internet does NOT know about the drawings
2015-06-17 21:32:22	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-17 21:32:29	@Espyo	you can google search as much as you want
2015-06-17 21:32:45	@Espyo	only info you'll get is us, ...wikia..., and one forum here or there with an easy drawing
2015-06-17 21:33:59	@PikFan	yay ellipses
2015-06-17 21:34:12	@PikFan	*ellipsises
2015-06-17 21:34:16	@PikFan	...I think?
2015-06-17 21:34:18	@PikFan	guh
2015-06-17 21:34:52	@PikFan	ellipses

2015-06-17 21:52:31	@Espyo	had to pause for a bit because of Inkipedia and E3
2015-06-17 21:52:39	@Espyo	gonna use this week to settle things down
2015-06-17 21:52:39	@PikFan	mm
2015-06-17 21:52:43	@Espyo	and hopefully I'll continue on Saturday
2015-06-17 21:52:48	@Espyo	but I'm still doing AI stuff
2015-06-17 21:52:51	@Espyo	almost over, though
2015-06-17 21:52:55	@PikFan	speaking of E3, Nintendo's Digital Event was a letdown
2015-06-17 21:52:55	@Espyo	...well, the Pikmin and enemies are
2015-06-17 21:53:01	@Espyo	then I'll have to do the leaders' AI
2015-06-17 21:53:04	@Espyo	and minor objects
2015-06-17 21:53:06	@Espyo	still, close
2015-06-17 21:53:09	@Espyo	yeah, it was pretty "meh"
2015-06-17 21:53:27	@PikFan	they were speaking of transformation
2015-06-17 21:53:42	@Espyo	mhm
2015-06-17 21:53:49	@PikFan	and I realized they're transforming into a company that makes minigames and toys
2015-06-17 21:54:00	@Espyo	let's hope not
2015-06-17 21:54:00	@PikFan	not really a good transformation
2015-06-17 21:54:21	@PikFan	imo amiibo is just another cash crop for Nintendo
2015-06-17 21:54:33	@Espyo	it is, but it works
2015-06-17 21:54:43	@PikFan	I know that
2015-06-17 21:55:08	@PikFan	but I don't like how some games make you buy amiibo in order to get 100% completion
2015-06-17 21:55:11	@PikFan	that's bs
2015-06-17 21:55:20	UltraMario	but pikfan
2015-06-17 21:55:22	UltraMario	the game is free
2015-06-17 21:55:25	UltraMario	so
2015-06-17 21:55:30	@PikFan	what game
2015-06-17 21:55:40	UltraMario	the game that youre talking about
2015-06-17 21:55:40	UltraMario	:P
2015-06-17 21:55:44	UltraMario	the ac amiibo thing
2015-06-17 21:55:46	UltraMario	right?
2015-06-17 21:55:50	@PikFan	no, I don't know — oh, that
2015-06-17 21:55:56	UltraMario	so
2015-06-17 21:56:01	@PikFan	I wasn't referring to that, but yeah
2015-06-17 21:56:10	UltraMario	it's not like you're paying $60 for a full game and then buying amiibos for it
2015-06-17 21:56:11	Testyo	$ 60 = 55.182 € / £ 38.994 
2015-06-17 21:56:17	UltraMario	so it's at least fair
2015-06-17 21:56:38	@PikFan	simply put, I don't like amiibo
2015-06-17 21:56:52	UltraMario	i do
2015-06-17 21:56:52	UltraMario	:|
2015-06-17 21:56:59	@PikFan	well good for you
2015-06-17 21:57:06	UltraMario	better than skylanders, lol
2015-06-17 21:57:29	@PikFan	didn't they make a skylanders/amiibo crossover or some nonsense
2015-06-17 21:58:16	UltraMario	at least they actually can function for more tha n one game
2015-06-17 21:58:19	UltraMario	lol
2015-06-17 21:58:30	UltraMario	skylanders has new figures of the same characters for every game
2015-06-17 21:58:41	UltraMario	so you have to waste more money on the same character just in a different game
2015-06-17 21:58:44	UltraMario	amiibos aren't like that
2015-06-17 21:58:48	UltraMario	also yes they did
2015-06-17 21:58:59	UltraMario	but it's only 2 amiibos
2015-06-17 21:59:15	@PikFan	Bowser and Donkey Kong, iirc
2015-06-17 21:59:51	UltraMario	yes
2015-06-17 21:59:59	@PikFan	mhm
2015-06-17 22:00:15	UltraMario	hey, ac amiibo party could be worse
2015-06-17 22:00:23	UltraMario	it could have all the players moving around in a car
2015-06-17 22:00:23	UltraMario	;)
2015-06-17 22:00:27	UltraMario	hehe
2015-06-17 22:00:27	@PikFan	okay, I still don't understand why they couldn't be assed to show Zelda at E3 :|
2015-06-17 22:00:32	UltraMario	they did
2015-06-17 22:00:34	UltraMario	;)
2015-06-17 22:00:41	@PikFan	no, Zelda Wii U
2015-06-17 22:00:44	UltraMario	well
2015-06-17 22:01:02	UltraMario	maybe they delayed it because they announced 2 more zelda games
2015-06-17 22:01:04	@PikFan	I know that they were focusing on just "immediate" releases
2015-06-17 22:01:13	UltraMario	so
2015-06-17 22:01:14	UltraMario	:P
2015-06-17 22:01:26	@PikFan	that logic in and of itself is... ugh
2015-06-17 22:01:37	UltraMario	well
2015-06-17 22:01:46	UltraMario	why else would they not show zelda
2015-06-17 22:01:47	UltraMario	:S
2015-06-17 22:01:57	@PikFan	because they're idiots
2015-06-17 22:02:00	UltraMario	wow rude
2015-06-17 22:02:16	@PikFan	it's getting more true by the day
2015-06-17 22:02:22	UltraMario	yeah okay
2015-06-17 22:02:33	@PikFan	so many bad decisions
2015-06-17 22:02:41	UltraMario	no matter how big of idiots you think they are they aren't ea bad
2015-06-17 22:02:42	UltraMario	lol
2015-06-17 22:02:44	@PikFan	...I still need to get Splatoon
2015-06-17 22:02:54	@Espyo	it's fun
2015-06-17 22:02:59	@Espyo	but make sure that it is what you want
2015-06-17 22:03:04	UltraMario	see? nintendo till can make good games
2015-06-17 22:03:11	@PikFan	yeah I know
2015-06-17 22:03:14	UltraMario	*still
2015-06-17 22:03:18	@PikFan	that's why I still support them
2015-06-17 22:03:30	UltraMario	well it sounded like you didn't support them
2015-06-17 22:03:36	UltraMario	the way you said it
2015-06-17 22:03:37	UltraMario	:p
2015-06-17 22:03:50	@PikFan	I disagree with their marketing choices and whatnot
2015-06-17 22:03:54	UltraMario	oh
2015-06-17 22:04:06	UltraMario	no marketing choice can ever be as bad as what they did for earthbound
2015-06-17 22:04:07	UltraMario	;P
2015-06-17 22:04:10	UltraMario	THIS GAME STINKS!!!
2015-06-17 22:04:11	@PikFan	*COUGH...no showing Zelda Wii U...COUGH*
2015-06-17 22:04:39	UltraMario	well what i mean is that
2015-06-17 22:04:59	UltraMario	those 2 zelda games overshadowed development of the wii u zelda which means they have nothing to show off
2015-06-17 22:05:02	UltraMario	that's just my theory anyway
2015-06-17 22:05:03	UltraMario	:P
2015-06-17 22:05:05	@PikFan	I believe a good E3 showcases not only near-future releases, but also long-term projects
2015-06-17 22:05:20	@PikFan	Pikmin 3 was revealed a year before it came out
2015-06-17 22:05:34	@PikFan	and ZWU was revealed last year
2015-06-17 22:05:43	UltraMario	wait wut
2015-06-17 22:05:50	@PikFan	Zelda Wii U
2015-06-17 22:05:56	UltraMario	i know
2015-06-17 22:05:57	UltraMario	but
2015-06-17 22:06:02	@PikFan	?
2015-06-17 22:06:25	UltraMario	they delayed zelda wii u, so we dont know when it's coming out... i dont think
2015-06-17 22:06:37	@PikFan	hopefully next year
2015-06-17 22:06:45	@PikFan	some people think 2017
2015-06-17 22:07:05	UltraMario	well then it's not for a game a year before it's released if it's in 2017
2015-06-17 22:07:05	UltraMario	:p
2015-06-17 22:07:18	@PikFan	well, my point was:
2015-06-17 22:07:33	@PikFan	you should keep talking about something until it comes out
2015-06-17 22:07:39	@PikFan	to keep people interested
2015-06-17 22:07:46	UltraMario	true

2015-06-19 20:13:31	@PikFan	I want to join their MK8 group since I've got it
2015-06-19 20:13:39	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-19 20:13:46	@PikFan	anyone on Skype right now?
2015-06-19 20:13:58	@Espyo	there always is, yeah
2015-06-19 20:14:25	@PikFan	the one nice thing about windows 8 is that I'm already logged into skype
2015-06-19 20:14:37	@PikFan	but it's not me — it's my mom's
2015-06-19 20:14:40	@PikFan	ooh
2015-06-19 20:14:48	@Espyo	well, any windows can auto-login skype
2015-06-19 20:14:57	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-19 20:15:11	@PikFan	in other news, but not that you care, I finished chapter 4 of my story
2015-06-19 20:15:39	@PikFan	it's pretty long, at about 3,500 words
2015-06-19 20:15:49	@PikFan	my other chapters were only about 2,000
2015-06-19 20:15:59	@Espyo	hm, neat
2015-06-19 20:16:04	@Espyo	how many lines?
2015-06-19 20:16:10	@Espyo	I'm guessing you're adding manual linebreaks
2015-06-19 20:16:11	@PikFan	lines?
2015-06-19 20:16:16	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-06-19 20:16:18	@PikFan	I had to
2015-06-19 20:16:18	@Espyo	fanfiction.net isn't a fan of non-manual linebreaks
2015-06-19 20:16:43	@PikFan	yeah, I had to manually linebreak everything because I wrote it on google docs
2015-06-19 20:17:00	@Espyo	did...
2015-06-19 20:17:07	@Espyo	did somebody just seriously create this category http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Beady_Long_Legs
2015-06-19 20:17:09	@PikFan	on google docs, it tabs, so when I c+p'd it into the editor, I had to add lines
2015-06-19 20:17:14	@PikFan	...
2015-06-19 20:17:19	@PikFan	so glad we're not there
2015-06-19 20:17:52	@Espyo	good to know the only activity on wikia is just insane people talking stupid stuff
2015-06-19 20:17:56	@Espyo	and insane people making stupid pages
2015-06-19 20:18:12	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-19 20:18:15	@PikFan	let it rot
2015-06-19 20:18:21	@J	text editors can generally auto-insert hard word wrapping if you want
2015-06-19 20:18:42	@PikFan	I see (not really)
2015-06-19 20:18:54	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-06-19 20:20:28	@PikFan	for some reason, when I'm writing in docs, quote marks look like “ ”, instead of " ", which is what I'm used too
2015-06-19 20:20:30	@PikFan	*to
2015-06-19 20:20:50	@PikFan	so I had to change every single different quote mark

2015-06-19 20:22:12	@PikFan	12:16	Espyo	how many lines?
2015-06-19 20:22:16	@PikFan	but I didn't count the lines
2015-06-19 20:22:25	@PikFan	I never do
2015-06-19 20:22:26	@Espyo	any text editor should tell you
2015-06-19 20:22:53	@PikFan	uh
2015-06-19 20:23:02	@PikFan	the wiki editor's doesn't
2015-06-19 20:23:19	@J	PikFan: I mean, instead of you manually doing line breaks, lots of text editors could do it for you
2015-06-19 20:23:31	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-06-19 20:24:03	@PikFan	it's because I didn't understand what 'hard word wrapping' meant, but I guess I do now
2015-06-19 20:24:36	@J	yeah, soft wrapping would be displaying it wrapped, hard wrapping would be actually storing those line breaks in the file
2015-06-19 20:26:34	UltraMario	pikfan
2015-06-19 20:26:35	UltraMario	guess what
2015-06-19 20:26:40	@PikFan	?
2015-06-19 20:26:49	UltraMario	im getting a new wii u
2015-06-19 20:27:06	@PikFan	sweet
2015-06-19 20:27:20	@PikFan	you're going to transfer everything over then, I assume?
2015-06-19 20:27:48	@PikFan	Espyo: what's the Pikipedia group name on skype
2015-06-19 20:28:18	@Espyo	I don't think you can join groups on skype
2015-06-19 20:28:20	@Espyo	you need to be invited

2015-06-19 20:39:27	-->	Waterpikmin (Mibbit@zpxk-936-86-531-74.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net) has joined #pikipedia
2015-06-19 20:39:34	Waterpikmin	hello?
2015-06-19 20:39:44	@PikFan	hi
2015-06-19 20:39:54	@Espyo	hi
2015-06-19 20:40:08	Waterpikmin	i have a small prediction on when we are getting a fourth pikmin game in the series
2015-06-19 20:40:49	Waterpikmin	so, if you look on the amiibo website, you can see the shadow of amiibo figures
2015-06-19 20:41:09	Waterpikmin	these include, tom nook, mario, bowser, samus, and link
2015-06-19 20:41:24	Waterpikmin	and one of them includes a pikmin amiibo
2015-06-19 20:41:34	Waterpikmin	so, the question is
2015-06-19 20:41:52	Waterpikmin	will we be getting a pikmin amiibo with either pikmin  3 or 4?
2015-06-19 20:42:04	Waterpikmin	i think the answer is yes, but eventually
2015-06-19 20:42:04	@Espyo	I want to say yes
2015-06-19 20:42:13	@Espyo	but at the same time, that's not really a trend that happened with other amiibo
2015-06-19 20:42:33	Waterpikmin	the shadows all got an amiibo in one way or another
2015-06-19 20:42:50	Waterpikmin	the mario, bowser, tom nook, and samus amiibos all happened
2015-06-19 20:43:05	@Espyo	I mean a game being announced with the release of an amiibo
2015-06-19 20:43:05	Waterpikmin	and when the tom nook amiibo was revealed, so was a new animal crossing game
2015-06-19 20:43:17	Waterpikmin	see where im going? 
2015-06-19 20:43:37	Waterpikmin	chibi robo zip lash was announced with amiibo too

2015-06-19 20:44:25	@J	so you've successfully deduced that Pikmin 4 will be released some time in the future?
2015-06-19 20:44:45	Waterpikmin	the pikmin smash one may be just for smash, only reason is because the shadow shows pikmin by themselves and not olimar
2015-06-19 20:44:54	Waterpikmin	im hoping so
2015-06-19 20:45:21	Waterpikmin	i want a new pikmin game so badly
2015-06-19 20:45:31	@PikFan	don't we all...
2015-06-19 20:45:40	@PikFan	it needs to be longer
2015-06-19 20:45:43	Waterpikmin	everyone in this chatroom does!
2015-06-19 20:45:49	Waterpikmin	it does need to be longer
2015-06-19 20:46:13	Waterpikmin	that would be the only thing that was needed for pikmin
2015-06-19 20:46:16	@PikFan	P3 was nice, but really? 9 years? kind of a letdown
2015-06-19 20:46:26	@PikFan	you'd think it'd be longer
2015-06-19 20:46:32	Waterpikmin	pikmin 2 is most likely my favorite because it was so long
2015-06-19 20:46:41	@PikFan	Espyo
2015-06-19 20:46:43	@PikFan	...
2015-06-19 20:46:45	Waterpikmin	and the was so much ADVENTURE
2015-06-19 20:46:49	Waterpikmin	ther*
2015-06-19 20:46:51	@Espyo	hmm?
2015-06-19 20:46:53	@PikFan	Espyo: so I decided to log in using my FB account
2015-06-19 20:46:53	Waterpikmin	lol there*
2015-06-19 20:47:00	@Espyo	oh boy
2015-06-19 20:47:24	@PikFan	...?
2015-06-19 20:47:54	Waterpikmin	i think that the next pikmin game will be on the wii u
2015-06-19 20:48:44	Waterpikmin	only reason is because i believe it was mentioned by miyamoto himself that he wanted pikmin to be the reason on why ppl buy the wii u
2015-06-19 20:49:26	Waterpikmin	another thing
2015-06-19 20:49:32	Waterpikmin	i have a theory for splatoon
2015-06-19 20:49:50	Waterpikmin	this is a bit strange, but i have evidence to back it up
2015-06-19 20:50:24	Waterpikmin	so, you know how they announced the splatfest in the game right?
2015-06-19 20:50:48	Waterpikmin	the news cast would begin
2015-06-19 20:51:18	Waterpikmin	they would then proceed to say, "we have gotten word from, on high..." 
2015-06-19 20:51:58	Waterpikmin	with video footage being broadcasted on the tv behind the squid sisters
2015-06-19 20:52:29	Waterpikmin	this video shows a printer printing the theme for the splatfest, cats or dogs
2015-06-19 20:52:50	Waterpikmin	espyo, this is my theory
2015-06-19 20:53:27	Waterpikmin	so the true question is... who is using the printer?
2015-06-19 20:53:31	@Espyo	well, he did get that with Pikmin 3
2015-06-19 20:53:38	@Espyo	the "reason to buy a Wii U" thing
2015-06-19 20:53:44	Waterpikmin	good point lol
2015-06-19 20:54:04	@Espyo	oh, we haven't gotten a Splatfest yet
2015-06-19 20:54:09	@Espyo	so I'm guessing it starts tomorrow for you Americans?
2015-06-19 20:54:14	Waterpikmin	its coming tomorrow
2015-06-19 20:54:20	Waterpikmin	yeah lol
2015-06-19 20:54:28	@Espyo	Europe only gets it in a few weeks
2015-06-19 20:54:28	Waterpikmin	but you can vote early
2015-06-19 20:54:31	@Espyo	that stinks :/
2015-06-19 20:54:40	@Espyo	I REEAAALLY want to play on the night maps
2015-06-19 20:54:43	@Espyo	they're drop-dead gorgeous
2015-06-19 20:55:33	Waterpikmin	they look amazing
2015-06-19 20:55:58	Waterpikmin	and the actual event makes it seem like the squid sisters are actual celebrities
2015-06-19 20:56:06	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-19 20:56:09	@Espyo	gaaaaaah, the hype
2015-06-19 20:57:06	Waterpikmin	so did you see the theory i have for the cutscene?
2015-06-19 20:57:16	Waterpikmin	or at least the stuff i said above lol
2015-06-19 20:58:22	Waterpikmin	i think the person using the printer is the last person in the world of splatoon
2015-06-19 20:58:49	Waterpikmin	in splatoon you see no mention about a dog at ALl
2015-06-19 20:58:54	Waterpikmin	ALL*
2015-06-19 20:59:40	Waterpikmin	so the only person that would have any knowledge of a dog would have to be a human
2015-06-19 21:00:23	Waterpikmin	and if callie is describing the printer as, "from, on high..." they must not know what the printer actually is
2015-06-19 21:01:01	Waterpikmin	and the squid sisters also mention a dog as " man's best friend" as if it were nothing
2015-06-19 21:01:09	Waterpikmin	so they must know something
2015-06-19 21:02:12	Waterpikmin	so espyo, what do you think about the theory?
2015-06-19 21:08:57	@Espyo	hm, yes
2015-06-19 21:09:00	@Espyo	it's plausible
2015-06-19 21:09:23	Waterpikmin	im trying to find the cutscene so you can see it
2015-06-19 21:10:21	@Espyo	I saw an image
2015-06-19 21:10:27	@Espyo	but I'll see it when our Splatfest happens
2015-06-19 21:11:02	Waterpikmin	its of the squid sisters looking at the printer that is printing out the theme
2015-06-19 21:11:07	@Espyo	yes
2015-06-19 21:12:17	Waterpikmin	its also the same printer that is on one of the sunken scrolls
2015-06-19 21:13:09	Waterpikmin	this printer is important in the game's lore
2015-06-19 21:13:24	Waterpikmin	i dont exactly know what importance it will have
2015-06-19 21:13:33	Waterpikmin	but there is something starneg
2015-06-19 21:13:36	Waterpikmin	strange*
2015-06-19 21:14:17	UltraMario	one of the squid sisters reminds me of bayonetta
2015-06-19 21:14:26	Waterpikmin	callie lol
2015-06-19 21:14:26	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-19 21:14:30	@Espyo	and apparently the other is her sister
2015-06-19 21:14:32	@Espyo	from the second game

2015-06-20 20:54:50	@PikFan	so there's Louie's icon, surrounded by the bubble
2015-06-20 20:55:28	@PikFan	but there's an empty space surrounding Louie's head that looks like Olimar's icon
2015-06-20 20:55:51	@PikFan	ugh, brb, firefox is lagging

2015-06-20 21:01:20	@Espyo	huh
2015-06-20 21:01:23	@Espyo	that's weird
2015-06-20 21:01:30	@Espyo	anything in particular that you were doing at the time?
2015-06-20 21:01:34	@Espyo	involving leaders?
2015-06-20 21:02:32	@PikFan	well, I was on Day 2...
2015-06-20 21:02:51	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaaah
2015-06-20 21:03:13	@PikFan	see, this is EXACTLY why I want a screen capture
2015-06-20 21:03:42	@Espyo	hehe
2015-06-20 21:03:45	@Espyo	but they're so pricey
2015-06-20 21:03:55	@Espyo	I want a good one now, so I can capture Pikmin 3
2015-06-20 21:04:01	@Espyo	because I REALLY want to make a video showing all drawings
2015-06-20 21:04:03	@Espyo	but hey, guess what
2015-06-20 21:04:07	@Espyo	I'm not MADE OF MONEY
2015-06-20 21:04:20	@Espyo	the one I have wasn't too expensive, but it doesn't support PAL60
2015-06-20 21:04:54	@PikFan	I saw one somewhere that supported GCN, Wii, and Wii U
2015-06-20 21:05:07	@PikFan	as well as a bunch of other consoles
2015-06-20 21:05:39	@PikFan	I forgot what it was called and its price, but I thought it was reasonably priced
2015-06-20 21:06:26	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-06-20 21:06:34	@PikFan	Elgato Game Capture HD
2015-06-20 21:07:09	@PikFan	wow, only $150
2015-06-20 21:07:09	Testyo	$ 150 = 137.955 € / £ 97.485 
2015-06-20 21:11:39	@Espyo	..."only"
2015-06-20 21:12:01	@PikFan	well, at least it isn't like $300
2015-06-20 21:12:02	Testyo	$ 300 = 275.91 € / £ 194.97 
2015-06-20 21:12:04	@Espyo	it's just a thing that receives signal and copies it elsewhere
2015-06-20 21:12:10	@Espyo	it's not made of unicorn urine
2015-06-20 21:12:29	@PikFan	are you saying it shouldn't be that costly
2015-06-20 21:12:38	UltraMario	im a squid now
2015-06-20 21:12:41	UltraMario	im akid now
2015-06-20 21:12:55	@PikFan	because I agree with you
2015-06-20 21:13:08	@Espyo	it really shouldn't
2015-06-20 21:13:26	UltraMario	espyo im hyped for splatoooooooooon
2015-06-20 21:13:27	@Espyo	it receives signal like a simple SCART cable
2015-06-20 21:13:27	UltraMario	:>
2015-06-20 21:13:30	UltraMario	it looks so fuuuuuuun
2015-06-20 21:13:35	@Espyo	which doesn't cost more than 2€
2015-06-20 21:13:35	Testyo	2 € = £ 1.4132  / $ 2.1744 
2015-06-20 21:13:42	@Espyo	and sends it via, normally, USB
2015-06-20 21:13:54	@Espyo	the conversion could be a thing that takes some manufacturing to get right
2015-06-20 21:13:57	@Espyo	but 150?
2015-06-20 21:14:00	@Espyo	that's 100 too many
2015-06-20 21:14:07	@Espyo	and a cost of 50-60 is still pretty pricey
2015-06-20 21:14:28	@Espyo	I smell company agreements on this
2015-06-20 21:14:31	UltraMario	splatooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon
2015-06-20 21:14:35	@Espyo	there's already a big monopoly with Elgato
2015-06-20 21:14:47	@Espyo	but other companies that get in on the screen capture device deal
2015-06-20 21:14:53	UltraMario	Espyo are you a kid or a squid
2015-06-20 21:14:53	@Espyo	might all make their prices match
2015-06-20 21:14:56	@Espyo	both
2015-06-20 21:15:00	@Espyo	it's fun, UM
2015-06-20 21:15:02	@Espyo	you getting it, then?
2015-06-20 21:15:33	UltraMario	:>
2015-06-20 21:15:35	UltraMario	yes
2015-06-20 21:15:41	UltraMario	when i get a new wii u
2015-06-20 21:15:42	UltraMario	:p
2015-06-20 21:15:43	@PikFan	I really want Splatoon...

2015-06-21 00:09:23	@PikFan	well then, I await people to read it and review

2015-06-21 00:10:42	@Espyo	hm?
2015-06-21 00:10:43	@PikFan	does 384 mean anything in programming?

2015-06-23 20:23:42	@Espyo	pretty much
2015-06-23 20:23:50	@Espyo	but I STILL prefer him being a goof here than on wikia
2015-06-23 20:23:58	@Espyo	at least he's not destructive

2015-06-23 20:26:29	@Espyo	and it's only a sentence
2015-06-23 20:26:40	@Espyo	but eh, at least one out of every 10 of his edits are actually good
2015-06-23 20:26:46	@Espyo	or the barebones to something good

2015-06-23 20:27:18	@Espyo	hehe
2015-06-23 20:27:41	@PikFan	it's because it's such a mess that I don't want to clean it

2015-06-24 22:16:23	En_Passant	I think it's canon, based on our description

2015-06-26 20:58:54	@PikFan	their username was PikFan22

2015-06-26 21:13:21	Pi	oh
2015-06-26 21:13:23	Pi	FINALLY
2015-06-26 21:13:34	@PikFan	it happened last summer
2015-06-26 21:13:41	Pi	lmao I'm out of the loop
2015-06-26 21:13:50	Pi	so what triggered this anyway
2015-06-26 21:14:04	@PikFan	a user from Pikmin Wiki approached Espyo
2015-06-26 21:14:15	@PikFan	and they wanted to discuss things
2015-06-26 21:14:30	@PikFan	so they talked on skype, and Espyo convinced them to come here
2015-06-26 21:14:36	@PikFan	since Pikipedia is the better host
2015-06-26 21:14:44	Pi	ah
2015-06-26 21:14:55	@PikFan	(by they I mean the PW admins)
2015-06-26 21:15:10	Pi	so it still exists, because Wikia cannot delete it, but everyone came to the better place
2015-06-26 21:15:13	@PikFan	so Espyo and J used GPBot to import all the pages and what not
2015-06-26 21:15:16	@PikFan	mhm
2015-06-26 21:15:16	Pi	and because Wikia sucks
2015-06-26 21:15:22	@PikFan	money
2015-06-26 21:15:27	@PikFan	all about the money
2015-06-26 21:15:27	Pi	it's awful
2015-06-26 21:15:36	Pi	Jimmy Wales is the owner of Wikia
2015-06-26 21:15:39	Pi	that's the scary part
2015-06-26 21:15:53	@PikFan	wikia is the dark side of wikipedia
2015-06-26 21:15:55	Pi	so he owns Wikipedia and Wikia
2015-06-26 21:16:19	Pi	sadly, the Harry Potter Wikia hasn't made the transition yet — but what's weird is that the Dutch version of it has
2015-06-26 21:16:27	Pi	but not the English one
2015-06-26 21:16:32	Pi	which is super duper weird
2015-06-26 21:16:54	@PikFan	but yeah, we got everything imported, and we manually merged the articles
2015-06-26 21:17:02	Pi	good on you
2015-06-26 21:17:13	@PikFan	the sad thing is
2015-06-26 21:17:19	@PikFan	by we I mean mostly Espyo
2015-06-26 21:17:33	@PikFan	he did most of the work
2015-06-26 21:17:46	@PikFan	heck, recently he made a page analyzer

2015-06-26 21:21:14	@PikFan	uh
2015-06-26 21:21:21	@PikFan	where does it say that?
2015-06-26 21:21:35	@PikFan	I'm thinking that's not real
2015-06-26 21:21:41	Pi	Why does it need to be in a trivia section? Why are there trivia sections?
2015-06-26 21:22:01	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Policy#Trivia
2015-06-26 21:22:53	Pi	Ah, okay.
2015-06-26 21:23:29	@PikFan	yeah, Espyo also expanded the policy a great deal
2015-06-26 21:24:16	Pi	amazing
2015-06-26 21:24:21	Pi	no that was not sarcasm
2015-06-26 21:24:28	@PikFan	heh
2015-06-26 21:24:29	Pi	either way, I need to get some shuteye now
2015-06-26 21:24:38	Pi	because I am tired
2015-06-26 21:24:45	@PikFan	will you be back later?
2015-06-26 21:24:54	Pi	yes, will be here for the summer

2015-06-26 21:33:47	@Espyo	so many mentions of my name
2015-06-26 21:34:14	@Espyo	I can barely remember you Pi
2015-06-26 21:34:15	@PikFan	it'll be called Pikmin: The Lost Days, and it will detail what happens to the Pikmin between the first two games
2015-06-26 21:34:20	@Espyo	so sorry if I didn't let you in on the loop
2015-06-26 21:35:21	@Espyo	oh, night Pi

2015-06-26 21:37:02	@PikFan	yay
2015-06-26 21:37:05	@Espyo	I think the enemy and Pikmin AI is all done
2015-06-26 21:37:09	@Espyo	much more solid and flexible
2015-06-26 21:37:19	@Espyo	(those two should be contradicting, but aren't :| )
2015-06-26 21:37:30	@PikFan	heh
2015-06-26 21:37:34	@Espyo	now I have to revamp the leader AI too
2015-06-26 21:37:36	@Espyo	then some other objects
2015-06-26 21:37:44	@Espyo	and then I can move on to something else, like the music, or gates

2015-06-29 23:56:04	StarWolf	hey, am i allowed to upload pictures even if i don't use them (so that others can?)
2015-06-29 23:57:03	Pidgey	I don't see why that should be an issue — this is a wiki, after all.
2015-06-29 23:57:17	@PikFan	hi Pidgey
2015-06-29 23:57:30	@PikFan	yeah, per Pidgey
2015-06-29 23:58:29	Pidgey	hi PikFan
2015-06-29 23:58:57	BetaMaster	jhi betamaster
2015-06-29 23:59:02	@PikFan	:D
2015-06-29 23:59:09	Pidgey	how are you
2015-06-29 23:59:16	StarWolf	ok. I'm an artist (sortta i have a long way to go) but im not planing on making a game any time soon
2015-06-29 23:59:16	@PikFan	tired
2015-06-29 23:59:27	@PikFan	...wait, who were you asking
2015-06-29 23:59:28	Pidgey	alright
2015-06-29 23:59:32	@Espyo	well, on Pikipedia, the uploaded images better be used
2015-06-29 23:59:35	Pidgey	both I suppose
2015-06-29 23:59:36	@Espyo	but on fanon, it's fine
2015-06-29 23:59:56	@PikFan	though they should be used there, too
2015-06-30 00:00:28	StarWolf	ok. oh, and thanks again, Espyo. (i was the wiki gust from before)
2015-06-30 00:00:36	@Espyo	mhm, I gathered
2015-06-30 00:00:38	@Espyo	you're welcome
2015-06-30 00:00:45	@Espyo	yeah, they should be used if you upload them
2015-06-30 00:00:46	@Espyo	but it's like
2015-06-30 00:00:51	@Espyo	on Pikipedia, you better use them on a content page
2015-06-30 00:00:58	@Espyo	you can only really upload five or so images for personal use
2015-06-30 00:01:14	@Espyo	but on fanon, you should put them on content pages, but they can stay on your user page
2015-06-30 00:01:22	@Espyo	as long as they're actually on-topic
2015-06-30 00:01:26	@PikFan	the policy surrounding that is really lax
2015-06-30 00:01:31	@Espyo	like, canon stuff for Pikipedia and fanon stuff for Fanon
2015-06-30 00:01:35	@Espyo	then it's fine
2015-06-30 00:01:44	@Espyo	but if people come around uploading 30 irrelevant images just because we allow uploads
2015-06-30 00:01:49	@Espyo	that's stupid, we're not an image hoster
2015-06-30 00:03:13	StarWolf	i just wanted to draw an ice/snow pikmin for people to use who may not be as good or something.
2015-06-30 00:04:16	@Espyo	yeah, that's fine
2015-06-30 00:04:20	@Espyo	you can probably put it on your user page
2015-06-30 00:04:40	StarWolf	cool, thanks.
2015-06-30 00:04:48	@PikFan	hey, question
2015-06-30 00:05:04	@PikFan	this is out of nowhere, but who what was your old username?
2015-06-30 00:05:17	@PikFan	*-who
2015-06-30 00:05:36	StarWolf	i think it was... zoltcat...?
2015-06-30 00:05:43	@PikFan	oh

2015-06-30 01:17:51	@PikFan	I'm sorry, but for whatever reason, it won't let me shrink it
2015-06-30 01:18:06	@PikFan	it keeps saying "invalid thumbnail"
2015-06-30 01:18:23	@PikFan	I don't know why it's doing that, but that shouldn't happen

2015-06-30 01:25:24	StarWolf	also i said some good things about your story, but i messed the sig up. 
2015-06-30 01:26:10	@PikFan	hey, thanks for the input!
2015-06-30 01:26:30	@PikFan	I chose "Ignis" as a play on the word "igneous"
2015-06-30 01:27:07	StarWolf	idk what that means XD
2015-06-30 01:27:38	StarWolf	AND THE FILE STILL DON'T WORK, yay
2015-06-30 01:27:48	@PikFan	oh boy...
2015-06-30 01:28:00	@PikFan	igneous - relating to or involving volcanic processes
2015-06-30 01:29:08	StarWolf	OH igneous rock im not used to seeing spelled out. lol im such a derp XD
2015-06-30 01:29:23	@PikFan	hehe
2015-06-30 01:30:10	StarWolf	im still laughing is that bad
2015-06-30 01:30:22	@PikFan	no
2015-06-30 01:30:30	@PikFan	I laugh over tiny stuff all the time
2015-06-30 01:31:39	StarWolf	well then thats one thing we have in common... other than the obvious
2015-06-30 01:32:05	@PikFan	:P
2015-06-30 01:33:01	StarWolf	theres something that happend to another fandom im in that i hope dosnt happen to pikmin.
2015-06-30 01:33:20	@PikFan	what happened to it?
2015-06-30 01:34:50	StarWolf	eh its not to big of a deal. some kid came in and started to spam people saying "MINECRAFT IS BETTER THAN FNAF! IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN BETER AND WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER."  
2015-06-30 01:35:49	@PikFan	lovely
2015-06-30 01:36:22	@PikFan	I doubt that'll happen here, since Pikmin is nowhere near as popular as Minecraft and FNAF
2015-06-30 01:36:33	@PikFan	though I wish it were
2015-06-30 01:36:50	StarWolf	and people were like "we get it. you like minecrat better. please go away" 
2015-06-30 01:37:04	@PikFan	mhm
2015-06-30 01:37:18	@PikFan	he's just looking to pick a fight
2015-06-30 01:37:50	StarWolf	well, one of the things that gives pikmin its charm is that its under rated. 
2015-06-30 01:41:19	StarWolf	and yes he was probably piking a fight.
2015-06-30 01:42:19	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-30 01:44:11	StarWolf	i saw the pikmin engine thing by espyo. how well does it work?
2015-06-30 01:44:27	@PikFan	haven't tried it out in ages
2015-06-30 01:44:32	@PikFan	but it works decently
2015-06-30 01:46:14	StarWolf	it looks really cool, givin im a nerd for that stuff so people will be able to play other's games? or is that something i should ask Espyo
2015-06-30 01:52:19	StarWolf	i have to get of soon, but before i do, whats the code for the "chocolate" template?

2015-06-30 18:53:55	StarWolf	it's not the pikmin i originally wanted, but it's still good. 
2015-06-30 18:54:04	StarWolf	oh hi Espyo
2015-06-30 18:55:49	StarWolf	the file should be Wolf Pikmin.png 
2015-06-30 18:56:01	@PikFan	yeah, looking at it now
2015-06-30 18:56:16	Yoshi2	PikFan: it's an incremental game about making numbers go up faster?
2015-06-30 18:56:24	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-30 18:56:44	StarWolf	cool! what do you think of it?
2015-06-30 18:56:51	@PikFan	after nearly 2 months of semi-active playing I got 200 prisms
2015-06-30 18:56:59	@PikFan	it looks good
2015-06-30 18:57:01	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-06-30 18:57:12	StarWolf	yes?
2015-06-30 18:57:19	@PikFan	I had an idea about how to fix the other one
2015-06-30 18:57:27	Yoshi2	I used to play cookie clicker a lot, but gave up on it after a while
2015-06-30 18:57:46	StarWolf	ok. im all ears
2015-06-30 18:57:51	@PikFan	alright, so
2015-06-30 18:57:52	Yoshi2	does it have offline progress?

2015-06-30 18:58:28	@PikFan	StarWolf: I'm going to delete the file then have you reupload it
2015-06-30 18:58:30	Yoshi2	:s
2015-06-30 18:58:44	@PikFan	but I also need you to shrink the file because it's so huge
2015-06-30 18:58:58	StarWolf	ok. I'll crop it.
2015-06-30 18:58:59	@PikFan	try shrinking it to about the size of the Wolf Pikmin

2015-06-30 19:47:56	StarWolf	ok. the 100 edits made sense. i just needed some explain
2015-06-30 19:48:00	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

2015-06-30 19:48:36	@PikFan	the wiki's not working
2015-06-30 19:48:41	StarWolf	*explanation 
2015-06-30 19:48:46	StarWolf	no!
2015-06-30 19:48:51	@PikFan	fatal error
2015-06-30 19:48:59	@PikFan	even though Porple said he fixed it :|
2015-06-30 19:49:36	@PikFan	alright, it let me on now
2015-06-30 19:49:42	@PikFan	but pages take forever to load
2015-06-30 19:49:59	@PikFan	why do you do this to me fanon...
2015-06-30 19:50:13	StarWolf	it hurts because it loves
2015-06-30 19:50:16	@PikFan	hey, do any of you get fatal errors too?
2015-06-30 19:50:25	StarWolf	nope
2015-06-30 19:50:56	@PikFan	you never get a blank screen on Fanon that says Fatal error on line 220 or something like that?
2015-06-30 19:51:43	StarWolf	sometimes my computer dosnt load it properly but thats it.
2015-06-30 19:51:49	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-30 19:51:59	@PikFan	maybe there's an issue with my network
2015-06-30 19:52:40	StarWolf	were i live theres about to be a thunder storm. could wether be a factor?
2015-06-30 19:52:46	@PikFan	doubtful
2015-06-30 19:52:55	@PikFan	well maybe
2015-06-30 19:52:55	@PikFan	idk
2015-06-30 19:54:35	StarWolf	im reading the connection of the worlds article. its really good
2015-06-30 19:57:18	@PikFan	oh, thanks
2015-06-30 19:57:30	@PikFan	I need to detail the extra gameplay modes sometime
2015-06-30 19:58:35	StarWolf	YOU MADE IT? *scrolls to the top* you did! good job! and you have a lige time to do that.
2015-06-30 19:58:43	StarWolf	*life
2015-06-30 20:04:35	StarWolf	why are all sprays 'Ultra'? why cant there be a 'mild' spray that has a weaker affect but costs less to make?
2015-06-30 20:06:41	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-06-30 20:06:49	@PikFan	that sounds like an interesting idea
2015-06-30 20:06:54	@PikFan	HAHAHAHA
2015-06-30 20:06:59	@PikFan	Reggie you make me laugh
2015-06-30 20:07:17	@PikFan	"Look, we know that the fans want a straight Samus Aran game," he said. "We also know that the best way to launch a game like that is to surprise and delight them, to give them a launch date, in an environment like this let them play it versus what other companies do, which is to announce a project that you may not see for five, six years. 
2015-06-30 20:07:19	@PikFan	It’s just not the way we do things."
2015-06-30 20:07:26	@PikFan	yeah, you say that
2015-06-30 20:07:31	@PikFan	but then there's Zelda
2015-06-30 20:07:36	@PikFan	which is coming out in 2017
2015-06-30 20:07:53	@PikFan	such a hypocrite
2015-06-30 20:08:23	@PikFan	also, Miyamoto is saying the Wii U failed because people didn't understand it and poor launch time
2015-06-30 20:08:32	@PikFan	I agree with the former and disagree with the latter
2015-06-30 20:08:33	StarWolf	heh. im slightly mad at Nintendo of America right now. i should be over it by now, but im not.
2015-06-30 20:08:55	@PikFan	but Miyamoto completely overlooked something: 3rd party support
2015-06-30 20:08:55	Pi	they should've just called it something else
2015-06-30 20:09:08	@PikFan	yeah, exactly
2015-06-30 20:09:18	@PikFan	why couldn't you call it the Wii 2 or Super Wii
2015-06-30 20:09:30	@PikFan	not some weird name like Wii U
2015-06-30 20:09:41	@PikFan	the name isn't the biggest issue though
2015-06-30 20:09:43	Pi	I love how that was one of the big things Ninty was talking about at the E3 reveal, then everyone just ditched the console altogether
2015-06-30 20:09:54	StarWolf	its sbort for "Wii Universe"
2015-06-30 20:09:59	Pi	no
2015-06-30 20:10:00	@PikFan	source?
2015-06-30 20:10:03	Pi	it was Wii
2015-06-30 20:10:07	Pi	then U, as in You
2015-06-30 20:10:20	BetaMaster	I think "Wii" itself is a strange name
2015-06-30 20:10:28	StarWolf	cant renember XD 
2015-06-30 20:10:30	Pi	PikFan: the reveal of the console at E3 2013.
2015-06-30 20:10:46	@PikFan	no, I asked source at StarWolf
2015-06-30 20:10:50	@PikFan	not you :P
2015-06-30 20:10:55	@PikFan	but thanks anyway
2015-06-30 20:10:58	Pi	Ah, fair enough. :P
2015-06-30 20:11:14	@PikFan	personally I hope the NX won't be centered around a gimmick like the Wiis
2015-06-30 20:11:25	@PikFan	it should be a traditional console
2015-06-30 20:11:54	@PikFan	but knowing Nintendo, who likes doing things differently, will probably shove some sort of gimmick down everyone's throats
2015-06-30 20:12:27	StarWolf	just nothing like the Kinect
2015-06-30 20:12:36	Pi	I like the GamePad though, but apparently nobody wants to challenge conventional controlling methods
2015-06-30 20:12:40	@PikFan	please no
2015-06-30 20:12:50	@PikFan	I see a lot of potential in the GamePad
2015-06-30 20:12:56	@PikFan	like voice control, for example
2015-06-30 20:13:10	@PikFan	because there's a microphone really close to you
2015-06-30 20:13:21	StarWolf	i always thought they added the toche 
2015-06-30 20:13:40	Pi	there were mini-games in Mario Party 6 and Mario Party 7 that used a Mic
2015-06-30 20:13:47	@PikFan	hmm
2015-06-30 20:14:00	@PikFan	but I meant for like system prompts
2015-06-30 20:14:03	Pi	I own two of them because I own both MP6 and MP7
2015-06-30 20:14:04	StarWolf	*touch screen to fit in with the tablets and stuff
2015-06-30 20:14:08	@PikFan	like how you do on Xbox
2015-06-30 20:14:24	@PikFan	but of course, you wouldn't have to do it
2015-06-30 20:14:27	@PikFan	also, another thing
2015-06-30 20:14:47	@PikFan	if Nintendo had made their hardware powerful enough, you should theoretically be able to run two apps at once
2015-06-30 20:14:56	@PikFan	one on the TV, another on the GamePad
2015-06-30 20:15:19	StarWolf	that'd make my life so much easier
2015-06-30 20:15:44	Pi	I'd also have liked it if TVii was a thing they actually cared about
2015-06-30 20:15:47	Pi	'cause it's gone for me
2015-06-30 20:15:52	@PikFan	I disliked how you'd be forced to close the game you're in so that you could go to system settings
2015-06-30 20:16:01	@PikFan	yeah, nobody uses TVii
2015-06-30 20:16:03	Pi	because oh no it's Europe you can't justify the needs of everyone
2015-06-30 20:16:09	@PikFan	they barely advertised that
2015-06-30 20:16:09	Pi	even in America?
2015-06-30 20:16:14	@PikFan	nope
2015-06-30 20:16:18	@PikFan	nobody talks about it
2015-06-30 20:16:19	Pi	lmao
2015-06-30 20:16:36	@PikFan	it's just... nonexistent
2015-06-30 20:17:11	@PikFan	I haven't used Miiverse much, but it looks like people enjoy it
2015-06-30 20:17:25	Pi	Memeverse is great
2015-06-30 20:17:37	@PikFan	yay puns :D
2015-06-30 20:18:05	@PikFan	Nintendo needs to update their online services though
2015-06-30 20:18:10	Yoshi2	I love the art in the Japanese miiverse
2015-06-30 20:18:11	@PikFan	it needs to be much more seamless
2015-06-30 20:18:15	Pi	one of my favourite people always go to a game and inspect the water and post a screenshot of it
2015-06-30 20:18:17	Pi	saying
2015-06-30 20:18:21	Pi	"that's some nice water"
2015-06-30 20:18:31	@PikFan	TOO MUCH WATER
2015-06-30 20:18:35	@PikFan	ugh, IGN
2015-06-30 20:18:39	Pi	and he just goes on and on about how water looks nice
2015-06-30 20:18:56	@PikFan	that's great
2015-06-30 20:18:59	Pi	I wonder what he'd feel playing Super Mario Sunshine
2015-06-30 20:19:13	BetaMaster	Super Mario Sunshine had some nice water
2015-06-30 20:19:24	Pi	then there's this amazing person named Insurance_Lizard who posts things I can't even believe Nintendo allows through
2015-06-30 20:19:46	Pi	it's subtle things that he gets under the radar
2015-06-30 20:20:11	@PikFan	like what?
2015-06-30 20:20:23	Pi	sexual innuendos
2015-06-30 20:20:26	Pi	loads of them
2015-06-30 20:20:41	Pi	yes my humour is sometimes crude
2015-06-30 20:22:11	@PikFan	oh heh
2015-06-30 20:22:25	@PikFan	I don't mind, I hang out with people who make lots of sexual jokes
2015-06-30 20:23:16	Yoshi2	the stuff people do when they are bored
2015-06-30 20:23:20	@PikFan	anyway, I think it's funny that they say the NX isn't a replacement for Wii U and 3DS
2015-06-30 20:23:32	@PikFan	wow Yoshi2 XDDD
2015-06-30 20:24:33	@PikFan	but as soon as NX hits, and if it's good enough, most people will forget about the Wii U
2015-06-30 20:24:51	@PikFan	I heard rumors it'll be called Nintendo Fusion
2015-06-30 20:25:04	@PikFan	there was even an article somewhere listing the specs of it
2015-06-30 20:26:58	Pi	I don't like the rumours though
2015-06-30 20:27:02	Yoshi2	listing the RUMOURED specs of it
2015-06-30 20:27:36	Pi	for instance, the Wii U was codenamed Project Café during its development, and that was what was known to the public about it prior to the E3 reveal
2015-06-30 20:27:59	Pi	hmm, speaking of, I wonder what the product code for Wii U articles are

2015-06-30 20:57:00	@PikFan	yes
2015-06-30 20:57:10	@PikFan	but my 3DS is broken so I can't play it
2015-06-30 20:57:17	Waterpikmin	ok
2015-06-30 20:57:25	Waterpikmin	ive been trying to find ppl to play
2015-06-30 20:57:35	@PikFan	hm
2015-06-30 20:57:43	Waterpikmin	and getting friends online in the game is just about impossible
2015-06-30 20:58:01	Waterpikmin	so i was looking at something
2015-06-30 20:58:01	@PikFan	I think BetaMaster has it
2015-06-30 20:58:10	Waterpikmin	let me get the link and cool
2015-06-30 20:58:13	@PikFan	though I'm not sure if he wants to play it

2015-06-30 21:00:20	Waterpikmin	PikFan this is what i wanted to show espyo lol
2015-06-30 21:02:18	@PikFan	uh
2015-06-30 21:02:26	@PikFan	reading's never been an issue for me
2015-06-30 21:02:36	Waterpikmin	?
2015-06-30 21:02:44	Waterpikmin	oh ok
2015-06-30 21:02:45	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 21:03:08	Waterpikmin	yeah when i saw that i wanted to show espyo just so he knows lol
2015-06-30 21:03:21	@PikFan	maybe he's got really sensitive eyes
2015-06-30 21:03:26	@PikFan	but the background isn't an issue
2015-06-30 21:03:32	@PikFan	I can read it just fine
2015-06-30 21:03:47	Waterpikmin	i can read it fine too
2015-06-30 21:04:10	Yoshi2	well, I can sort of see their point
2015-06-30 21:04:14	Waterpikmin	yeah
2015-06-30 21:04:34	Yoshi2	the background is very busy and quite distracting to the eyes
2015-06-30 21:04:46	Waterpikmin	i think this is something we need to show espyo eventually lol
2015-06-30 21:04:49	Waterpikmin	and yoshi
2015-06-30 21:05:07	Waterpikmin	do you have Animal crossing new leaf?
2015-06-30 21:05:52	Yoshi2	yup, but my 3ds broke too
2015-06-30 21:06:29	Yoshi2	and out of warranty ._.
2015-06-30 21:06:49	Waterpikmin	so many broken 3dses lol
2015-06-30 21:06:58	Waterpikmin	how did they break btw?
2015-06-30 21:08:17	Yoshi2	I am unable to turn the 3DS on if the screen is open
2015-06-30 21:09:07	Waterpikmin	wow thats strange
2015-06-30 21:09:47	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-06-30 21:09:48	@PikFan	does it make a popping noise and do the screens flash when you try to power it on?
2015-06-30 21:10:02	Yoshi2	sort of
2015-06-30 21:11:05	Waterpikmin	when you either get new ones or replace them we should have a sort of club for animal crossing
2015-06-30 21:11:12	Waterpikmin	would make the game so much more fun
2015-06-30 21:11:48	@PikFan	so you press the power button, the power LED turns on, and then it makes a popping noise? is that what happens?

2015-06-30 21:12:44	Yoshi2	well, the screen flashes for a bit and goes off again, don't remember if it makes a popping noise though
2015-06-30 21:13:03	Yoshi2	it's been a while since I tried to turn it on, and I've put it away since then
2015-06-30 21:13:11	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-06-30 21:13:13	Waterpikmin	wait a minute
2015-06-30 21:13:17	Waterpikmin	what if
2015-06-30 21:13:24	Waterpikmin	omni visited the pikmin wiki
2015-06-30 21:13:28	@PikFan	because that's what happened to mine
2015-06-30 21:13:34	Waterpikmin	to SMASHIFY a pikmin character!?!?
2015-06-30 21:14:26	Yoshi2	my old DS broke in half
2015-06-30 21:14:34	@PikFan	o.o
2015-06-30 21:14:47	Yoshi2	sadly, I cannot use the bottom as a gameboy advance 
2015-06-30 21:15:08	Waterpikmin	lol that stinks
2015-06-30 21:15:35	Waterpikmin	if they release a pikmin new 3ds xl, would you get it?
2015-06-30 21:15:54	@PikFan	maybe
2015-06-30 21:16:02	@PikFan	depends if I have money
2015-06-30 21:16:02	Waterpikmin	i would in an INSTANT
2015-06-30 21:16:11	Waterpikmin	i would do anything to get one
2015-06-30 21:17:55	@Espyo	so many mentions of my name
2015-06-30 21:17:56	@Espyo	sorry, was away
2015-06-30 21:18:01	@Espyo	and I have to be away again
2015-06-30 21:18:05	Yoshi2	solution: don't be away
2015-06-30 21:18:26	@PikFan	Espyo: https://twitter.com/artsyomni/status/608754065481314304
2015-06-30 21:18:39	@PikFan	and why do you have to be away? for how long?
2015-06-30 21:18:59	Waterpikmin	i found that link and thought it would be important
2015-06-30 21:21:08	@PikFan	I don't understand why he thinks it's hard to read
2015-06-30 21:21:10	@PikFan	it isn
2015-06-30 21:21:13	@PikFan	isn't
2015-06-30 21:23:15	@PikFan	this kid is hilarious
2015-06-30 21:23:24	@PikFan	he's desperately trying to get me to come out
2015-06-30 21:23:30	Yoshi2	PikFan: the issue, as far as I can see it, is not that you can't read it, but it is a bit hard on the eyes due to the background being so distracting
2015-06-30 21:23:36	Yoshi2	at least in my case
2015-06-30 21:23:51	Waterpikmin	yeah that may be it
2015-06-30 21:23:52	@PikFan	he's just standing on my porch and knocking on my door while making himself look like a total idiot
2015-06-30 21:24:01	@PikFan	that isn't an issue for me
2015-06-30 21:24:02	Waterpikmin	and we may be used to it since we have been here for a while
2015-06-30 21:24:09	@PikFan	yeah that
2015-06-30 21:26:43	@PikFan	HE CAME BACK LKAMSKLCNAKNF

2015-06-30 21:32:43	@PikFan	(if that's even the right word to use)
2015-06-30 21:33:01	@PikFan	(oh, it is)
2015-06-30 21:33:40	Yoshi2	you concede defeat?
2015-06-30 21:34:18	@PikFan	yep
2015-06-30 21:34:29	Yoshi2	woohoo!
2015-06-30 21:34:31	@PikFan	I admit my argument is invalid
2015-06-30 21:34:33	@PikFan	therefore fish
2015-06-30 21:34:55	Yoshi2	smells fishy
2015-06-30 21:37:52	Waterpikmin	ive been trying to find things to do in animal crossing lol
2015-06-30 21:38:21	Yoshi2	I thought about putting down some streets in my town
2015-06-30 21:38:26	Yoshi2	but never got to do that
2015-06-30 21:38:34	@PikFan	I started doing that
2015-06-30 21:38:48	@PikFan	and then somebody moved in right where I was going to put them :
2015-06-30 21:38:49	@PikFan	:|
2015-06-30 21:38:51	@PikFan	...
2015-06-30 21:38:54	 *	@PikFan sighs
2015-06-30 21:38:55	Yoshi2	PikFan: that is the worst
2015-06-30 21:39:07	@PikFan	so I tried and tried to harass them and kick them out
2015-06-30 21:39:14	@PikFan	did they? nope
2015-06-30 21:39:32	@PikFan	I hate how when you want someone there, they move
2015-06-30 21:39:38	@PikFan	and when you don't, they don't move
2015-06-30 21:39:52	Waterpikmin	i deal with whoever is in my town
2015-06-30 21:39:57	Waterpikmin	i try to grow to like them
2015-06-30 21:40:30	Yoshi2	PikFan: I think you can talk the people into not moving out if you want
2015-06-30 21:40:54	Yoshi2	if you speak to them at the right time
2015-06-30 21:40:56	@PikFan	I know that
2015-06-30 21:41:18	@PikFan	but I never know that they're moving till it's too late
2015-06-30 21:41:30	@PikFan	i.e. when I get the letter
2015-06-30 21:41:40	@PikFan	...maybe I need to check their houses more

2015-06-30 21:44:30	@PikFan	should I be concerned...?

2015-06-30 21:44:45	@Espyo	PikFan: remember some time ago about a supposed Rayman leak?
2015-06-30 21:44:50	@Espyo	in Smash 4?

2015-06-30 21:46:33	Waterpikmin	i am a CRAZY fan of omni
2015-06-30 21:46:36	Pi	it's the cost of 1/3 of the game
2015-06-30 21:46:43	Pi	but with abysmal content
2015-06-30 21:46:49	Pi	the DLC model in MK8 was fine
2015-06-30 21:46:53	@Espyo	if HE's saying the text has bad contrast
2015-06-30 21:46:57	@Espyo	then by all means, we ARE fixing it
2015-06-30 21:46:58	@Espyo	period

2015-06-30 21:53:24	Waterpikmin	it was on the 10th
2015-06-30 21:53:40	@Espyo	I'll say thanks for the suggestion, and how we'll do it, and I'll also warn about how we moved, in a nice way
2015-06-30 21:54:16	Waterpikmin	maybe say btw we moved to this
2015-06-30 21:54:48	Waterpikmin	if he mentions us on one of his videos
2015-06-30 21:54:57	@J	okay
2015-06-30 21:55:01	Waterpikmin	it could be very important
2015-06-30 21:55:10	@Espyo	>@artsyomni Thanks for the suggestion! I guess we kind of become used to it after so long. I'll get right on it!
2015-06-30 21:55:13	@Espyo	I'll send this first
2015-06-30 21:55:18	Waterpikmin	ok
2015-06-30 21:55:29	Waterpikmin	sounds good
2015-06-30 21:55:38	Pi	hey
2015-06-30 21:55:44	Pi	are you logged in on the actual official account
2015-06-30 21:55:47	@Espyo	>@artsyomni And by the by, we moved from Wikia ages ago. It's a wasteland now. You'll find everything on Pikipedia.
2015-06-30 21:55:52	@Espyo	I'm not
2015-06-30 21:55:52	@J	seems kind of like you're sucking up, if this guy really is popular or something
2015-06-30 21:55:56	@Espyo	I figure I should be
2015-06-30 21:56:07	@Espyo	it does kind of feel like sucking up
2015-06-30 21:56:09	@Espyo	but on the other hand
2015-06-30 21:56:12	@J	I mean, you are sucking up
2015-06-30 21:56:16	@Espyo	it's not much different from what we'd reply to anybody else
2015-06-30 21:56:43	@J	The last sentence I can't see you saying to others
2015-06-30 21:56:43	@PikFan	misread as fucking up lol
2015-06-30 21:56:44	Waterpikmin	i need to find someone to play new leaf with lol
2015-06-30 21:57:01	Waterpikmin	haha pikfan
2015-06-30 21:57:02	@Espyo	but we kind of NEED to say it
2015-06-30 21:57:08	Waterpikmin	we do
2015-06-30 21:57:22	Waterpikmin	otherwise we could be considered as ignoring him
2015-06-30 21:57:25	@Espyo	I can probably reword it so it sounds more like "hey, we moved everything from wikia to us, so if you go on wikia, you'll only find less and more outdated things"
2015-06-30 21:57:33	Waterpikmin	and if he does talk about us in his videos
2015-06-30 21:57:45	@Espyo	I'll PM him in that case
2015-06-30 21:57:50	@Espyo	*-in that case
2015-06-30 21:57:59	@Espyo	I'll PM him asking him to plug us, pretty please
2015-06-30 21:58:11	@J	oh, never mind, I got a higher impression of this guy's level of fame than he actually seems to have
2015-06-30 21:58:25	@J	FWIW, I somewhat agree
2015-06-30 21:58:26	Waterpikmin	well
2015-06-30 21:58:37	@Espyo	"fwiw", haven't heard that one before
2015-06-30 21:58:39	@J	it's certainly clearly readable, but could be improved
2015-06-30 21:58:40	Waterpikmin	i think we could ask him if he could
2015-06-30 21:58:41	@Espyo	he's SOMEWHAT famous
2015-06-30 21:58:43	@J	for what it's worth
2015-06-30 22:00:01	Waterpikmin	but lets ask nicely since he came to the pikipedia to most likely get research on a new smashified canidate
2015-06-30 22:00:09	@Espyo	mhm
2015-06-30 22:00:13	@Espyo	I'm guessing Charlie
2015-06-30 22:00:14	Pi	Doesn't it mean 'for what it's worth'?
2015-06-30 22:00:38	Waterpikmin	charlie, brittany, shacho or louie
2015-06-30 22:01:12	Waterpikmin	that would be interesting considering they are a basic reskin of olimar
2015-06-30 22:01:15	@J	yep, I said it already
2015-06-30 22:01:18	@J	@Pi
2015-06-30 22:01:31	Pi	oh
2015-06-30 22:01:33	Pi	derp
2015-06-30 22:01:33	Waterpikmin	for example alph in smahs
2015-06-30 22:01:37	Waterpikmin	smash
2015-06-30 22:01:52	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 22:01:55	Pi	isn't Alph already in as an Olimar skin
2015-06-30 22:01:58	Waterpikmin	yeah
2015-06-30 22:02:11	Waterpikmin	alph is a basic reskin of olimar
2015-06-30 22:02:12	@Espyo	hm, right
2015-06-30 22:02:17	Waterpikmin	this is huge guys
2015-06-30 22:02:42	Waterpikmin	also
2015-06-30 22:02:45	Waterpikmin	another thing
2015-06-30 22:02:55	@PikFan	are you going to tell him using the wiki account?
2015-06-30 22:03:02	Waterpikmin	smashboards also reports on his smashified updates
2015-06-30 22:03:07	@Espyo	I'm talking to the Skype folk about it
2015-06-30 22:03:08	Waterpikmin	which is another huge news site
2015-06-30 22:03:15	@PikFan	what are they saying?
2015-06-30 22:03:20	@Espyo	apparently only one of us controls the Pikipedia twitter
2015-06-30 22:03:24	@Espyo	they're hyped
2015-06-30 22:03:31	Waterpikmin	lol so am i
2015-06-30 22:03:33	@Espyo	only Nathan is in charge, but he's offline, I think
2015-06-30 22:03:38	Waterpikmin	hmm
2015-06-30 22:03:45	@PikFan	Nathan?
2015-06-30 22:03:49	@PikFan	is that... uh
2015-06-30 22:03:57	@Espyo	Creative Sushi
2015-06-30 22:04:03	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-06-30 22:04:05	Waterpikmin	im really excited for what is going on right now
2015-06-30 22:04:11	Waterpikmin	what if i met omni
2015-06-30 22:04:13	Waterpikmin	WHAT IF
2015-06-30 22:04:24	@Espyo	we'll have to keep this simple
2015-06-30 22:04:25	@PikFan	I still lament over the fact that they prefer to use skype
2015-06-30 22:04:29	@Espyo	looking at it from his POV
2015-06-30 22:04:31	Waterpikmin	imagine if he came into this chatroom
2015-06-30 22:04:38	Waterpikmin	ESPYO
2015-06-30 22:04:43	@Espyo	it's like, he just wants quick info and reference images
2015-06-30 22:04:51	@Espyo	he just asked for a theme suggestion
2015-06-30 22:05:00	@Espyo	he doesn't want annoying people crawling on his knees saying this and that
2015-06-30 22:05:00	Waterpikmin	You could be a COMMENTATOR for his video
2015-06-30 22:05:11	@Espyo	shit, WP
2015-06-30 22:05:17	@Espyo	my dreams ;_;
2015-06-30 22:05:18	Waterpikmin	?
2015-06-30 22:05:25	@Espyo	you just raised them so high
2015-06-30 22:05:26	@PikFan	WP?
2015-06-30 22:05:27	Waterpikmin	oh yeah lol
2015-06-30 22:05:31	@Espyo	Waterpikmin
2015-06-30 22:05:32	@PikFan	oh, waterpikmin
2015-06-30 22:05:35	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-30 22:05:50	@Espyo	so I'm really thinking just one tweet saying yes
2015-06-30 22:05:56	Waterpikmin	you could talk to him on twitter
2015-06-30 22:06:05	@Espyo	one tweet telling people about the move
2015-06-30 22:06:20	@Espyo	and one PM asking him for a humble plug, and that if he needs further help, we've got it covered
2015-06-30 22:06:24	Pi	the second move, you mean
2015-06-30 22:06:33	@Espyo	I'll just refer to it as a general move
2015-06-30 22:06:34	@Espyo	like
2015-06-30 22:06:37	@Espyo	"we moved ages ago"
2015-06-30 22:06:40	Waterpikmin	yeah i think thats great espyo
2015-06-30 22:06:41	@Espyo	could refer to the first or second
2015-06-30 22:06:48	Waterpikmin	another thing
2015-06-30 22:06:50	@PikFan	hahahahah
2015-06-30 22:06:51	Waterpikmin	guys
2015-06-30 22:06:54	Waterpikmin	i livestream
2015-06-30 22:07:09	@PikFan	someone on the wikia made their account Great Uniter, referencing Legend of Korra
2015-06-30 22:07:20	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 22:07:30	Waterpikmin	one thing i wanted to mention
2015-06-30 22:07:32	@Espyo	hm
2015-06-30 22:07:34	@Espyo	(brb)
2015-06-30 22:07:53	Waterpikmin	i have been doing a live marathon of all of the pikmin games and im on 3 now
2015-06-30 22:07:58	Waterpikmin	btw they are all 100%
2015-06-30 22:09:29	@PikFan	please tell me no death
2015-06-30 22:09:57	Pi	^
2015-06-30 22:10:15	@PikFan	are they?
2015-06-30 22:11:45	Pi	It's a livestream, they're bound to not be.
2015-06-30 22:12:03	@PikFan	unless you're insane like Miles
2015-06-30 22:12:06	Pi	I'm assuming Waterpikmin isn't some amazing speedrunner of all three games.
2015-06-30 22:12:15	Pi	Miles doesn't even play the first game, though.
2015-06-30 22:12:21	@PikFan	what
2015-06-30 22:12:31	@PikFan	but /why/
2015-06-30 22:12:38	Pi	because obvious
2015-06-30 22:12:54	@PikFan	it isn't obvious for me
2015-06-30 22:12:55	Miles	I spent 6 hours today duplicating an item over and over
2015-06-30 22:12:57	Miles	Yay insanity
2015-06-30 22:13:03	Pi	:DD
2015-06-30 22:13:09	@Espyo	hmm
2015-06-30 22:13:09	@PikFan	:clap:
2015-06-30 22:13:10	@Espyo	which game?
2015-06-30 22:13:16	@PikFan	the first
2015-06-30 22:13:25	Miles	Echoes
2015-06-30 22:13:29	Pi	Oh?
2015-06-30 22:13:41	Pi	Let me guess, the first Missile Expansion?
2015-06-30 22:13:42	@PikFan	...I thought we were talking Pikmin?
2015-06-30 22:13:45	@PikFan	never mind
2015-06-30 22:13:55	Miles	No
2015-06-30 22:14:05	Pi	You can clone more stuff in Echoes now?
2015-06-30 22:14:35	 *	@PikFan is extremely simpleminded
2015-06-30 22:16:40	Waterpikmin	im not a speedrunner lol
2015-06-30 22:16:57	Pi	I guess my questions will be answered during SGDQ.
2015-06-30 22:17:14	@Espyo	for some reason, I'm imagining Smart Bombs
2015-06-30 22:17:21	@Espyo	...*Super Bombs?
2015-06-30 22:17:24	Waterpikmin	?
2015-06-30 22:17:25	@Espyo	wait, Power Bombs
2015-06-30 22:17:39	Pi	That would be quite the treat.
2015-06-30 22:18:10	Pi	Echoes is broken as is, would be neat to see how much more broken it has become.
2015-06-30 22:18:32	Waterpikmin	what are  we talking about lol
2015-06-30 22:18:44	<--	Yoshi2 (Yoshi2@2001:4dd3:d241:v:qskq:hhkm:lkjt:mjyv) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-06-30 22:19:38	Pi	Metroid Prime 2: Echoes.
2015-06-30 22:19:54	Waterpikmin	oh ok lol
2015-06-30 22:20:04	Waterpikmin	i havent played too many metroid games
2015-06-30 22:21:21	Pi	Which ones have you played?
2015-06-30 22:21:42	Waterpikmin	idk to be honest lol
2015-06-30 22:21:48	Waterpikmin	it has been a while
2015-06-30 22:25:08	Waterpikmin	im so hype for what is ahead of us 
2015-06-30 22:28:31	-->	StarWolf (Mibbit@gpw09-55.skytechbb.com) has joined #pikipedia
2015-06-30 22:28:49	StarWolf	hi!
2015-06-30 22:28:53	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Talk:Plant by Scruffy (+658) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Plant&curid=19112&diff=151029&oldid=151020
2015-06-30 22:31:10	@Espyo	oh, speaking of Talk:Plant
2015-06-30 22:31:14	Waterpikmin	?
2015-06-30 22:31:16	@Espyo	guys, please post your opinions there as well
2015-06-30 22:31:24	@Espyo	the talk page for the Plant article, WP
2015-06-30 22:31:30	Waterpikmin	wait opinions on what?
2015-06-30 22:31:32	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 22:31:33	@Espyo	specially you two, J, PikFan
2015-06-30 22:31:40	@Espyo	I discussed something on the talk page
2015-06-30 22:31:43	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-06-30 22:31:53	@Espyo	the Plant article's talk page
2015-06-30 22:31:55	@PikFan	oh, Plant vs Plants and fungi?
2015-06-30 22:31:58	@Espyo	go check it out and give our opinion
2015-06-30 22:32:00	@Espyo	*your
2015-06-30 22:32:01	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-30 22:32:08	Pi	Fungi aren't even plants, though.
2015-06-30 22:32:09	@PikFan	yeah, I think there should only be one page
2015-06-30 22:32:17	@PikFan	right
2015-06-30 22:32:21	@Espyo	yeah, but the name and content is important to discuss
2015-06-30 22:32:28	@Espyo	not as important as other things we've had on the wiki, no
2015-06-30 22:32:33	@Espyo	but still, something tricky to reach a conclusion in
2015-06-30 22:32:40	Waterpikmin	maybe just have it all in one to make things easier
2015-06-30 22:32:55	Waterpikmin	making future editing easier
2015-06-30 22:33:05	@PikFan	wait, Scruffy suggested having two pages
2015-06-30 22:33:06	Pi	The world of Pikmin is assumed to be a post-apocalyptic version of Earth, so I just find it suitable to use terminology and distinctions applicable to Earth.
2015-06-30 22:33:14	@PikFan	one for plants and one for fungi
2015-06-30 22:33:19	@Espyo	I'll check Scruffy's latest edit in a sec
2015-06-30 22:33:22	Waterpikmin	good point but in the end
2015-06-30 22:33:25	Waterpikmin	its a game
2015-06-30 22:33:57	Waterpikmin	and accessing the information on the page needs to be easy to do
2015-06-30 22:34:01	Waterpikmin	but idk
2015-06-30 22:34:02	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 22:34:53	@PikFan	yeah, I think they should have their own pages
2015-06-30 22:35:01	Waterpikmin	and starwolf
2015-06-30 22:35:13	Waterpikmin	do you have animal crossing new leaf?
2015-06-30 22:35:24	<--	StarWolf (Mibbit@gpw09-55.skytechbb.com) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-06-30 22:35:29	@PikFan	as it is, Plants and fungi sounds awkward
2015-06-30 22:35:30	@PikFan	wow
2015-06-30 22:35:32	Pi	rip StarWolf
2015-06-30 22:35:40	Waterpikmin	well rip
2015-06-30 22:35:43	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 22:35:44	Pi	rude tbh
2015-06-30 22:35:45	@PikFan	you killed him Waterpikmin
2015-06-30 22:35:52	Waterpikmin	?
2015-06-30 22:35:57	@PikFan	kidding
2015-06-30 22:36:09	Waterpikmin	lol i just asked if he had a game! 0-0
2015-06-30 22:36:32	@PikFan	anyway, I think it'd be better if they each had their own articles, following the structure Espyo proposed
2015-06-30 22:36:44	Waterpikmin	any way is fine with me lol
2015-06-30 22:38:12	@Espyo	but that way it'd be hard to refer to one article when we want to link to the "decorative greenery" mechanic
2015-06-30 22:38:25	@Espyo	plus half of the info would be repeated, kinda
2015-06-30 22:38:34	@Espyo	mostly about how it doesn't count for gameplay except as detail, except it does
2015-06-30 22:38:38	@Espyo	and that it's on the Piklopedia
2015-06-30 22:38:39	@Espyo	etc.
2015-06-30 22:38:40	Waterpikmin	especially when you consider the new people that want to look at that article
2015-06-30 22:39:00	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-30 22:39:10	@PikFan	so... should it be one page?
2015-06-30 22:39:44	Waterpikmin	i would say one page for convinience
2015-06-30 22:40:17	@PikFan	"Plants and fungi" still sounds awkward
2015-06-30 22:40:28	@PikFan	[[Spotcap and Kingcap]] this too
2015-06-30 22:40:28	Testyo	"Spotcap_and_Kingcap" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Spotcap_and_Kingcap
2015-06-30 22:40:50	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-06-30 22:40:55	@Espyo	IMO, it should be one page
2015-06-30 22:41:01	@Espyo	but it can be split into several JUST for the purpose of listing
2015-06-30 22:41:07	@Espyo	because I can imagine the list will get a bit big
2015-06-30 22:41:17	@Espyo	mostly because the unknown ones will have their own section
2015-06-30 22:41:22	@PikFan	also, what will we do about all the unnamed plants?
2015-06-30 22:41:23	@Espyo	or at least an article just for the unknowns
2015-06-30 22:41:33	@PikFan	Pikmin 3 has so, so many plants in it
2015-06-30 22:41:42	Waterpikmin	make a gallery?
2015-06-30 22:41:42	@Espyo	yeah, it's what I meant by "unknowns"
2015-06-30 22:41:46	@Espyo	too simple
2015-06-30 22:42:12	Waterpikmin	make a gallery that shows pictures of those unknown plants
2015-06-30 22:42:15	Waterpikmin	maybe

2015-06-30 22:42:21	@PikFan	...oh, I was focusing on what I was writing while you were writing, and I didn't notice it
2015-06-30 22:42:22	@PikFan	oops
2015-06-30 22:42:35	@PikFan	hi
2015-06-30 22:42:40	CreativeSushi	Ello
2015-06-30 22:43:05	Waterpikmin	SUSHI
2015-06-30 22:43:13	Waterpikmin	twitter!
2015-06-30 22:43:14	@Espyo	oh, hey
2015-06-30 22:43:17	Waterpikmin	OMNI!
2015-06-30 22:43:21	@Espyo	yeah, he knows
2015-06-30 22:43:27	Waterpikmin	ok cool lol
2015-06-30 22:43:43	@Espyo	shall we discuss the PM?
2015-06-30 22:43:45	CreativeSushi	Yup, I tweeted him back
2015-06-30 22:43:48	CreativeSushi	Yeah
2015-06-30 22:43:54	@Espyo	ok
2015-06-30 22:44:08	CreativeSushi	First off I need to figure out how to PM on twitter
2015-06-30 22:44:09	@Espyo	the way I see it, we should use this to ask him for a quick plug, and to tell him that we can help him further if he needs it
2015-06-30 22:44:18	@Espyo	but we still can't sound needy
2015-06-30 22:44:26	@Espyo	I say we give him our motivation
2015-06-30 22:44:31	@Espyo	and at the same time, explain the wikia move
2015-06-30 22:44:51	@Espyo	we explain how we moved away from wikia so we could have more freedom and power to bring better content to the world
2015-06-30 22:45:00	@Espyo	it's kind of hard to do so when wikia hogs visitors simply by existing
2015-06-30 22:45:04	@PikFan	I'd laugh if the wikia staff saw this then tried to tell us to not talk about this on twitter
2015-06-30 22:45:05	@Espyo	so we rely on word of mouth
2015-06-30 22:45:20	@Espyo	if he's okay with it, he could simply plugs us, to help our popularity, to help us make better content
2015-06-30 22:45:22	CreativeSushi	I don't know, we need to assume he doesn't care about us THAT much
2015-06-30 22:45:24	@Espyo	seems fair, unbiased
2015-06-30 22:45:33	CreativeSushi	I wouldn't go into why we moved
2015-06-30 22:45:34	@Espyo	I'd promptly shit on said wikian's face
2015-06-30 22:45:40	@Espyo	hm, agreed
2015-06-30 22:46:11	@PikFan	it needs to be short and sweet
2015-06-30 22:46:13	@Espyo	I think we should still point out how we want to grow on the independent site
2015-06-30 22:46:25	@Espyo	this is a PM, so it's not bound by the 140 chars
2015-06-30 22:46:43	@PikFan	but still, try avoid going in-depth
2015-06-30 22:47:10	Waterpikmin	he may have used the wiki to get info about a character though
2015-06-30 22:47:23	@Espyo	likely
2015-06-30 22:47:36	@Espyo	let me try a sketch
2015-06-30 22:48:02	Waterpikmin	maybe for a smashified character coming soon
2015-06-30 22:48:34	@PikFan	I feel like we're overreacting to this
2015-06-30 22:48:35	<--	Waterpikmin (Mibbit@zpxk-936-86-531-74.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-06-30 22:48:37	@PikFan	but what do I know
2015-06-30 22:48:40	CreativeSushi	I would just say, "Hi Omni, thanks for your input on the Wiki. Just wanted to let you know that @PikminWiki was our old twitter, which is why we had such a late response. We were all thrilled when we saw you had interest in the Wiki, as we are big fans of your work, and would love to see some Pikmin related content from you in the future."
2015-06-30 22:48:41	@Espyo	maybe we are
2015-06-30 22:48:44	CreativeSushi	As an opener
2015-06-30 22:48:46	-->	Waterpikmin (Mibbit@zpxk-936-86-531-74.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net) has joined #pikipedia
2015-06-30 22:48:48	@Espyo	but choosing between overreacting and underreacting
2015-06-30 22:48:51	Waterpikmin	ok lol
2015-06-30 22:48:54	@Espyo	I'd say overreacting gives better results
2015-06-30 22:49:20	@Espyo	hm, we might be going into too much detail on the whole "we hope to see Pikmin content" bit
2015-06-30 22:49:37	Waterpikmin	i think that we can talk to him as if we know who he is but not look like we all want his autograph on our physical copies of smash 4 lol
2015-06-30 22:49:39	CreativeSushi	I don't know we want to flatter him some
2015-06-30 22:50:02	@Espyo	yeah, but the "big fans" part might be enough
2015-06-30 22:50:07	CreativeSushi	Yeah
2015-06-30 22:50:08	@Espyo	the other seems like we're trying to swerve him to do something
2015-06-30 22:50:11	@Espyo	and we KINDA are
2015-06-30 22:50:14	@Espyo	but that's not quite it
2015-06-30 22:50:15	@PikFan	13:55	J	seems kind of like you're sucking up, if this guy really is popular or something
2015-06-30 22:50:15	Waterpikmin	say something like "we really enjoy your art"
2015-06-30 22:51:06	@PikFan	no, we just want to focus on the wiki
2015-06-30 22:51:16	@Espyo	"Hey Omni, thanks for your input on the wiki. Just wanted to let you know that @PikminWiki was our old twitter, which explains our late responses. We're big fans of your work, and we'd like to ask you something if you plan on making Pikmin-related content in the future.
2015-06-30 22:51:22	@Espyo	how's that for a start?
2015-06-30 22:51:52	@PikFan	>big fans of your work
2015-06-30 22:51:55	@PikFan	are we really?
2015-06-30 22:52:02	@Espyo	most of us are
2015-06-30 22:52:04	@PikFan	because we've never talked about him till now
2015-06-30 22:52:04	CreativeSushi	Well I am :P
2015-06-30 22:52:09	@Espyo	I am too
2015-06-30 22:52:17	@Espyo	not like an active fan that's always looking for updates
2015-06-30 22:52:17	@PikFan	hm, alright
2015-06-30 22:52:18	@Espyo	but I like his images
2015-06-30 22:52:23	@Espyo	some folks on skype are too
2015-06-30 22:52:26	Waterpikmin	im an active fan lol
2015-06-30 22:52:39	@PikFan	I dunno, "big fans" just sounds cheesy
2015-06-30 22:52:42	@Espyo	hm, yeah, I guess the contrast is pretty poor
2015-06-30 22:52:46	@Espyo	any alternatives?
2015-06-30 22:52:51	@PikFan	fans
2015-06-30 22:52:58	@Espyo	sounds good
2015-06-30 22:53:20	Waterpikmin	maybe a light green background  to contrast with a dark text
2015-06-30 22:53:22	CreativeSushi	Well, we could say "If you need any help finding resources or information regarding a Pikmin character, we are definitely willing to help"
2015-06-30 22:53:44	@PikFan	I'm just concerned if he prefers the wikia over the wiki
2015-06-30 22:54:00	Waterpikmin	along with maybe changing the list of thing on the left such as the search tool etc to a darker background
2015-06-30 22:54:00	CreativeSushi	I have a couple links that would change his mind instantly
2015-06-30 22:54:01	@PikFan	but he said the contrast is bad on both, so...
2015-06-30 22:54:38	@Espyo	he might, like the majority, not realize we moved, is all
2015-06-30 22:54:58	CreativeSushi	He thinks we're seperated
2015-06-30 22:55:09	@Espyo	hence why the 2nd reply was so important
2015-06-30 22:55:15	CreativeSushi	right
2015-06-30 22:55:25	@Espyo	okay, for the rest of the message...
2015-06-30 22:55:30	@Espyo	I was thinking of something like...
2015-06-30 22:56:14	CreativeSushi	We need to not message him untill we actually do what he asked as well
2015-06-30 22:56:43	@PikFan	good point
2015-06-30 22:56:44	CreativeSushi	Oh I see you did
2015-06-30 22:57:01	CreativeSushi	 Yeah that looks much nicer
2015-06-30 22:57:12	@Espyo	everybody ctrl+f5, btw, yeah
2015-06-30 22:57:28	@PikFan	whoa, yeah
2015-06-30 22:57:33	@PikFan	looks a lot better
2015-06-30 22:57:48	@Espyo	"We're dedicated, but we have a bit of a hard time getting views because of our old Wikia wiki. We can't delete it, and we mostly spread through word of mouth, so if you don't mind, could you please give a small shoutout to us?
2015-06-30 22:58:07	@Espyo	It would mean a lot, and would help us continue to grow and provide good Pikmin content.
2015-06-30 22:58:20	@Espyo	Thanks again, and now that over here, we'll be waiting for your next creation!
2015-06-30 22:58:24	@Espyo	something like that? ^
2015-06-30 22:58:26	@Espyo	for the second part
2015-06-30 22:58:28	CreativeSushi	Hmm
2015-06-30 22:58:33	@Espyo	goes immediately after the first part
2015-06-30 22:58:38	@Espyo	it's a bit rough, we need to soften the edges
2015-06-30 22:58:52	@PikFan	get rid of the "we'll be waiting for your next creation" bit
2015-06-30 22:58:58	@PikFan	sounds like we're stalking him
2015-06-30 22:59:27	@PikFan	I don't want him to think we're obsessing over him
2015-06-30 22:59:56	@Espyo	yeah, but I kind of want it to end on a supportive note
2015-06-30 23:00:01	Waterpikmin	and try to make it so we are not desperate, but are asking to spread the word
2015-06-30 23:00:10	@Espyo	one that leaves a message of "hey, it's cool if you don't, we still love you" in the air
2015-06-30 23:00:22	@Espyo	not sounding desperate is the hard part...
2015-06-30 23:00:55	@PikFan	well, I say let's be bold
2015-06-30 23:01:05	@PikFan	let's just get it done
2015-06-30 23:01:05	Waterpikmin	yeah 
2015-06-30 23:01:13	@Espyo	we have nothing to lose, I suppose
2015-06-30 23:01:15	Waterpikmin	im having so much fun talking about this
2015-06-30 23:01:18	@Espyo	although if we're TOO bold, he might toss us aside
2015-06-30 23:01:24	@Espyo	so we WILL have something to lose
2015-06-30 23:01:24	CreativeSushi	Naw wait
2015-06-30 23:01:33	@Espyo	yeah, no sudden reactions
2015-06-30 23:01:36	CreativeSushi	I think we are too bold, but at the same time I want to take this futher
2015-06-30 23:01:44	CreativeSushi	If we could get this guy in a pikcast
2015-06-30 23:01:49	CreativeSushi	That would be hot
2015-06-30 23:01:53	@Espyo	that might be TOO far
2015-06-30 23:01:56	@Espyo	but it wouldn't hurt to ASK
2015-06-30 23:01:56	@PikFan	that would be HUGE
2015-06-30 23:02:01	CreativeSushi	Yeah
2015-06-30 23:02:02	@Espyo	ask him if he'd be interested in
2015-06-30 23:02:04	CreativeSushi	But I have an idea
2015-06-30 23:02:19	CreativeSushi	Let me type something up, I'll get back to ya
2015-06-30 23:02:26	@PikFan	but first, we need to find out how much of an interest he's got in Pikmin
2015-06-30 23:02:33	@Espyo	mhm
2015-06-30 23:02:41	@Espyo	on his video about Travis
2015-06-30 23:02:44	@Espyo	the Mother 4 character
2015-06-30 23:02:58	@Espyo	he was mostly talking to the model creators about stuff in general
2015-06-30 23:03:05	@Espyo	while sped up footage of the image was rolling in the background
2015-06-30 23:03:21	@Espyo	admittedly, I couldn't really understand who did what, and what belonged to who :|
2015-06-30 23:03:25	@Espyo	but I wasn't paying THAT much attention
2015-06-30 23:03:41	@PikFan	speaking of models, did we ever contact the guys who ripped the P3 models?
2015-06-30 23:03:50	Waterpikmin	oh yeah
2015-06-30 23:03:51	@Espyo	we did, no response
2015-06-30 23:04:03	Waterpikmin	random talking bush was one of them
2015-06-30 23:04:04	@PikFan	drat
2015-06-30 23:04:07	@Espyo	but the Inkipedia chat has the guy who leaked the most recent maps
2015-06-30 23:04:12	@Espyo	so I'll try to contact him soon for help
2015-06-30 23:04:19	Waterpikmin	ok
2015-06-30 23:09:10	Waterpikmin	so anything we need to do?
2015-06-30 23:11:17	@Espyo	CreativeSushi: you got it yet?
2015-06-30 23:12:13	Waterpikmin	got what?
2015-06-30 23:12:42	Waterpikmin	do you think we should watch his videos in order to get any information about him and pikmin?
2015-06-30 23:13:39	@PikFan	bbl
2015-06-30 23:13:57	Waterpikmin	?
2015-06-30 23:14:07	@Espyo	not really
2015-06-30 23:14:12	@Espyo	also, "be back later"
2015-06-30 23:14:52	Waterpikmin	ok lol
2015-06-30 23:17:39	CreativeSushi	OK I'm here
2015-06-30 23:17:56	CreativeSushi	Its long, I think I'll post is on skype
2015-06-30 23:18:00	CreativeSushi	sorta long
2015-06-30 23:18:31	@Espyo	you can post it on pastebin so the guys here can see
2015-06-30 23:19:39	CreativeSushi	Alright
2015-06-30 23:20:14	Waterpikmin	ok
2015-06-30 23:20:27	Waterpikmin	what is the thing?
2015-06-30 23:22:28	CreativeSushi	http://pastebin.com/FjGDjk1Y
2015-06-30 23:23:05	@Espyo	right, so what I said on skype
2015-06-30 23:23:07	@Espyo	I'll just copy+paste
2015-06-30 23:23:15	@Espyo	the "non-profit" part might be better omitted
2015-06-30 23:23:16	@Espyo	[23:20:34] André Silva - Espyo: because wikia editors are non-profit too
2015-06-30 23:23:21	@Espyo	>also you say "future" twice in the next sentence
2015-06-30 23:23:26	@Espyo	we should probably split the part where we start talking about PikCast a bit
2015-06-30 23:23:26	@Espyo	[23:21:31] André Silva - Espyo: so as to not clash so much with what's being said right before
2015-06-30 23:23:32	@Espyo	then it needs minor grammar tweaks on the final paragraph
2015-06-30 23:23:32	@Espyo	[23:21:59] André Silva - Espyo: but I suppose it's good
2015-06-30 23:24:58	@Espyo	thoughts?
2015-06-30 23:25:31	CreativeSushi	I think they die
2015-06-30 23:25:39	@Espyo	ye
2015-06-30 23:26:05	CreativeSushi	Your welcome to edit that to your hearts content
2015-06-30 23:26:22	CreativeSushi	I just thought we needed to be a bit more casual
2015-06-30 23:26:25	CreativeSushi	in wording
2015-06-30 23:26:31	CreativeSushi	as well as mention pikcast and spotlight 
2015-06-30 23:26:32	Waterpikmin	i think you forgot a plural in artist and game
2015-06-30 23:27:52	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-30 23:28:00	@Espyo	yeah, more casual feels better
2015-06-30 23:28:45	Waterpikmin	casual seems good
2015-06-30 23:29:30	Waterpikmin	and one more thing
2015-06-30 23:30:16	Waterpikmin	all enthusiastic about collaborating
2015-06-30 23:30:27	Waterpikmin	it seems as though we are making him collab with us
2015-06-30 23:31:31	CreativeSushi	Well, yeah sorta. That would be the perfect outcome
2015-06-30 23:31:46	CreativeSushi	If we are helping him with information
2015-06-30 23:31:49	CreativeSushi	and him being in the pikcast
2015-06-30 23:31:55	CreativeSushi	for him to have a shout-out
2015-06-30 23:31:59	Waterpikmin	maybe add we are enhusiastic about collaborating with him if he wants
2015-06-30 23:31:59	CreativeSushi	thats kinda a collaboration
2015-06-30 23:32:22	@Espyo	ok, gonna try to revamp the message
2015-06-30 23:32:24	Waterpikmin	i guess so
2015-06-30 23:32:54	CreativeSushi	I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that we would really like to
2015-06-30 23:33:48	Waterpikmin	yeah that sounds good
2015-06-30 23:34:13	@Espyo	http://pastebin.com/VwEqZ1Pq final?
2015-06-30 23:36:05	CreativeSushi	I think it looks great
2015-06-30 23:36:16	Waterpikmin	are we able to remove this when we are done to avoid anyone seeing the message?
2015-06-30 23:36:38	Miles	http://i.imgur.com/hCJvnFU.png
2015-06-30 23:37:00	CreativeSushi	lol
2015-06-30 23:37:06	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-06-30 23:37:09	Pi	Miles what are you duplicating.
2015-06-30 23:37:14	CreativeSushi	people can only see it if you have the link
2015-06-30 23:37:23	Pi	Miles
2015-06-30 23:37:25	Pi	pls
2015-06-30 23:37:29	@Espyo	the message will be private
2015-06-30 23:37:32	@Espyo	just between us and him
2015-06-30 23:37:39	CreativeSushi	I think he means the pastebins
2015-06-30 23:37:44	@Espyo	oh, duh
2015-06-30 23:37:48	@Espyo	the first missile expansion
2015-06-30 23:37:49	@Espyo	I remember now
2015-06-30 23:37:55	@Espyo	wait, didn't you say "no" to that already?
2015-06-30 23:38:06	@Espyo	oh, the pastebins? I set mine to unlisted, and expiring in a week
2015-06-30 23:38:12	Pi	So you can clone that indefinitely nowadays?
2015-06-30 23:38:55	Pi	I'll just head off to m2k2 and lurk, I suppose.
2015-06-30 23:39:09	CreativeSushi	Alright, so i guess I'll go ahead and send the message?
2015-06-30 23:39:16	Waterpikmin	ok
2015-06-30 23:39:39	@Espyo	yeah, I guess so

2015-06-30 23:43:10	Waterpikmin	what is he doing?
2015-06-30 23:43:26	@Espyo	check the thread Pi posted
2015-06-30 23:44:07	@Espyo	eh, he says the PMs ALSO have a limit, he thinks
2015-06-30 23:44:10	@PikFan	infinite% for what?
2015-06-30 23:44:12	@Espyo	guess TwitLonger is the way to go
2015-06-30 23:44:17	@Espyo	for Metroid Prime 2
2015-06-30 23:44:25	@PikFan	no, I know
2015-06-30 23:44:33	CreativeSushi	So what about this 140 character limit, should I just split it up?
2015-06-30 23:44:39	@PikFan	er, maybe I should've said /of/ what
2015-06-30 23:44:42	@Espyo	no, use TwitLonger
2015-06-30 23:44:51	@Espyo	PikFan: answer's the same
2015-06-30 23:45:02	@PikFan	as in story completion?
2015-06-30 23:45:35	@Espyo	yeah
2015-06-30 23:45:42	@PikFan	but
2015-06-30 23:45:45	@PikFan	that's
2015-06-30 23:45:48	@PikFan	.../why/
2015-06-30 23:45:53	CreativeSushi	Oh, how does this work?
2015-06-30 23:45:58	@Espyo	what do you mean why
2015-06-30 23:46:02	@Espyo	why do you have day 1000+?

2015-06-30 23:46:51	Miles	No you're not, the save file deletes itself after Day 300!!!
2015-06-30 23:47:07	@PikFan	challenge accepted
2015-06-30 23:47:15	CreativeSushi	I don't think this works with DM
2015-06-30 23:47:49	Waterpikmin	what days are you talking about? pikmin 2?
2015-06-30 23:47:49	@PikFan	there has to be an upper limit for days
2015-06-30 23:47:53	@PikFan	yeah
2015-06-30 23:48:02	Waterpikmin	oh ok lol

2015-06-30 23:48:24	Pi	Miles is that 300 triple factorial
2015-06-30 23:48:40	@PikFan	oh NO
2015-06-30 23:48:43	@PikFan	why Pi
2015-06-30 23:48:51	@Espyo	upper limit is likely 2^16
2015-06-30 23:48:53	@PikFan	you made me brain explode
2015-06-30 23:49:08	@PikFan	for days?
2015-06-30 23:49:50	@Espyo	for days, yeah
2015-06-30 23:50:04	Pi	2^16 what is that now again
2015-06-30 23:50:06	@Espyo	if not that, (2^16)/2
2015-06-30 23:50:07	@Espyo	more or less
2015-06-30 23:50:09	Pi	I should have this memorised
2015-06-30 23:50:11	@Espyo	 65536
2015-06-30 23:50:20	@Espyo	also, HexChat is magic

2015-06-30 23:54:42	@Espyo	Pi: how do you use TwitLong?
2015-06-30 23:54:45	@Espyo	not really working for CreativeSushi
2015-06-30 23:54:56	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOhq_cjOGNo
2015-06-30 23:55:02	@PikFan	wow, Siri's mean
2015-06-30 23:55:50	Pi	I believe just like a usual twitter message
2015-06-30 23:56:03	Pi	but it creates a link to the tweet
2015-06-30 23:56:04	@Espyo	hear that, CreativeSushi?
2015-06-30 23:56:20	Pi	so you need to link the generated message
2015-06-30 23:56:26	@Espyo	hm
2015-06-30 23:56:55	Pi	I'm kind of useless right now, because I'm so tired. I apologise.
2015-06-30 23:57:50	CreativeSushi	Yeah but
2015-06-30 23:57:55	CreativeSushi	You can't do it for DM
2015-06-30 23:58:03	CreativeSushi	You can just log into the plugin, and then make a tweet
2015-06-30 23:58:11	CreativeSushi	Thats all it seems to give you the option for
2015-07-01 00:01:40	@Espyo	I have to go to bed
2015-07-01 00:01:47	@PikFan	night
2015-07-01 00:01:51	@Espyo	try googling how to use TwitLong
2015-07-01 00:01:58	@Espyo	I've heard about loads of people using it, so...

2015-07-01 00:02:01	@PikFan	oh, just saw a Pokemon game for mobile

2015-07-01 05:40:28	BetaMaster	hi
2015-07-01 05:40:37	Waterpikmin	hey i have a question lol
2015-07-01 05:40:47	Waterpikmin	do you happen to have animal crossing new leaf?
2015-07-01 05:40:56	BetaMaster	I used to
2015-07-01 05:40:58	Waterpikmin	im looking for ppl to play it with lol
2015-07-01 05:41:07	Waterpikmin	ive started to replay it
2015-07-01 05:41:35	Waterpikmin	i had an idea of sorta having a club for animal crossing to make the game more interesting
2015-07-01 05:42:27	Waterpikmin	wouldnt it be cool? lol
2015-07-01 05:43:06	BetaMaster	It's an interesting idea
2015-07-01 05:43:33	Waterpikmin	animal crossing seems lonely wihtout other ppl
2015-07-01 05:43:44	Waterpikmin	real ppl lol
2015-07-01 05:44:05	Waterpikmin	we can have monthly or weekly competitions
2015-07-01 05:44:07	BetaMaster	Without real people to steal fruit from
2015-07-01 05:44:12	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-07-01 05:45:32	Waterpikmin	i want to do it since there is so much content in the game
2015-07-01 05:45:51	Waterpikmin	know what i mean?
2015-07-01 05:46:34	BetaMaster	Yeah. It's packed with all kinds of extras and whatnot
2015-07-01 05:46:41	BetaMaster	and other fun stuff
2015-07-01 05:46:48	Waterpikmin	especially events throughout the year
2015-07-01 05:46:58	Waterpikmin	dont you think that would be fun to do?
2015-07-01 05:47:02	Waterpikmin	if you want
2015-07-01 05:47:12	Waterpikmin	you could start a new town if you still have the game
2015-07-01 05:47:20	BetaMaster	I haven't touched the game in over a year...
2015-07-01 05:47:27	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-07-01 05:47:49	Waterpikmin	its a game that has very slow pacing
2015-07-01 05:47:50	BetaMaster	I also don't have a 3DS anymore, so that basically prevents me from playing any games
2015-07-01 05:47:58	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-07-01 05:47:59	BetaMaster	*3DS games
2015-07-01 05:48:23	Waterpikmin	if only they had a wii u animal crossing, and not a MARIO PARTY CLONE
2015-07-01 05:49:01	BetaMaster	A Wii U Animal Crossing would be a good idea
2015-07-01 05:49:08	BetaMaster	with the large community that the Wii U has
2015-07-01 05:49:09	Waterpikmin	they have one
2015-07-01 05:49:17	Waterpikmin	but its based on a board game
2015-07-01 05:49:19	Waterpikmin	with
2015-07-01 05:49:22	Waterpikmin	amiibos...
2015-07-01 05:49:27	Waterpikmin	i collect amiibos so
2015-07-01 05:49:48	Waterpikmin	but it is not fitting to have an animal crossing game like that
2015-07-01 05:49:55	Waterpikmin	it looks fun
2015-07-01 05:50:06	BetaMaster	ah, heh
2015-07-01 05:50:16	Waterpikmin	and i guess the largest reason ppl didnt like the digital event
2015-07-01 05:50:19	BetaMaster	Also, if I randomly quit or stop responding, it's because my power went out
2015-07-01 05:50:28	Waterpikmin	was because it was not what they expected
2015-07-01 05:50:39	Waterpikmin	for example
2015-07-01 05:50:52	Waterpikmin	metroid prime federation force
2015-07-01 05:51:11	Waterpikmin	there is a petition to cancel the game because it isnt what ppl wanted
2015-07-01 05:51:18	Waterpikmin	but it doesent work that way!
2015-07-01 05:51:34	Waterpikmin	fan opinions are important
2015-07-01 05:51:48	BetaMaster	Even if it's not exactly what people wanted, I'm sure there are still plenty of people who would buy the game
2015-07-01 05:52:14	Waterpikmin	but it seems strange that people would not like the game and DISLIKE THE TRAILER FROM ANNOUNCEMENt
2015-07-01 05:52:29	Waterpikmin	i am going to most likely buy it
2015-07-01 05:52:36	Waterpikmin	a four player metroid game?
2015-07-01 05:52:37	Yoshi2	really, the only issue with federation force is that it is named metroid, it seems
2015-07-01 05:52:39	Waterpikmin	sure!
2015-07-01 05:52:46	Waterpikmin	yeah
2015-07-01 05:52:51	Yoshi2	most people wouldn't have cared if it wasn't named metroid
2015-07-01 05:53:03	Waterpikmin	it seems that people dont like the fact that it is different
2015-07-01 05:53:08	Waterpikmin	people dont like change
2015-07-01 05:53:12	Waterpikmin	and im gonna be honest
2015-07-01 05:53:29	Waterpikmin	its hard for me to like games like metroid changing
2015-07-01 05:53:35	BetaMaster	I'm all for change if it's in a good direction
2015-07-01 05:53:43	Waterpikmin	true
2015-07-01 05:53:50	BetaMaster	A bad example of good change: Paper Mario
2015-07-01 05:53:52	Waterpikmin	its a CO OP metroid game!
2015-07-01 05:53:56	BetaMaster	-good
2015-07-01 05:53:57	Yoshi2	well, people wanted a real single player metroid and were annoyed that the game is a multiplayer spinoff
2015-07-01 05:54:17	BetaMaster	*An example of bad change
2015-07-01 05:54:37	Waterpikmin	paper mario had one very bad change
2015-07-01 05:54:45	Waterpikmin	sticker star... ugh
2015-07-01 05:54:55	Waterpikmin	NO EXPERIENCE SYSTEM
2015-07-01 05:55:04	BetaMaster	Yeah, battles were pointless
2015-07-01 05:55:09	Waterpikmin	thats not an RPG if there is no experience system
2015-07-01 05:55:23	BetaMaster	The whole sticker system kind of bothered me too
2015-07-01 05:55:24	Waterpikmin	super paper mario was one example of good change
2015-07-01 05:55:31	Waterpikmin	it was different
2015-07-01 05:55:33	BetaMaster	Super Paper Mario was absolutely amazing
2015-07-01 05:55:36	Waterpikmin	but not bad different
2015-07-01 05:55:42	Waterpikmin	i LOVED it
2015-07-01 05:55:47	Waterpikmin	but not over ttyd
2015-07-01 05:55:52	Waterpikmin	ttyd is my fav
2015-07-01 05:56:01	Waterpikmin	now one thing that is positive
2015-07-01 05:56:04	BetaMaster	I'm still unsure which one I enjoyed more
2015-07-01 05:56:24	BetaMaster	Both of them had great music, stories, and dialogue
2015-07-01 05:56:28	Waterpikmin	mario and luigi paper jam is gonna work so much better than sticker star
2015-07-01 05:56:49	Waterpikmin	paper jam has an experience system
2015-07-01 05:56:50	BetaMaster	Just another Mario and Luigi game
2015-07-01 05:56:53	BetaMaster	Not that that's a bad thing
2015-07-01 05:57:26	Waterpikmin	mario and luigi is awesome because it shows off the cooperation of both the brothers
2015-07-01 05:57:51	Waterpikmin	and technically, paper mario is in it
2015-07-01 05:58:05	Waterpikmin	so its not like we didnt get any paper mario content
2015-07-01 05:58:13	Waterpikmin	wait i forgot
2015-07-01 05:58:17	Waterpikmin	no pikmin 4
2015-07-01 05:58:23	Waterpikmin	nintendo loses e3
2015-07-01 05:58:28	Waterpikmin	jk
2015-07-01 05:58:41	Waterpikmin	i think it may be announced later this year
2015-07-01 05:58:58	BetaMaster	I think I might be the only person in this channel who has never played a Pikmin game
2015-07-01 05:59:10	Waterpikmin	you never played a pikmin game?
2015-07-01 05:59:23	BetaMaster	I have Pikmin 3, but I haven't played it
2015-07-01 05:59:30	Waterpikmin	i suggest you play it soon
2015-07-01 05:59:35	Yoshi2	definitely
2015-07-01 05:59:38	Waterpikmin	its outstanding
2015-07-01 05:59:52	BetaMaster	I don't know that I will; my interest in video games has declined a lot
2015-07-01 06:00:04	Waterpikmin	it is one of the most unrecognized games 
2015-07-01 06:00:14	Waterpikmin	because there have only been 3 games
2015-07-01 06:00:27	Waterpikmin	over the life span of 13 years!
2015-07-01 06:01:23	Waterpikmin	one thing i like about pikmin 3 was that it made the environment look outstanding
2015-07-01 06:01:28	Waterpikmin	hold on
2015-07-01 06:01:37	Waterpikmin	i better check omnis twitter lol
2015-07-01 06:01:50	Waterpikmin	nothing lol
2015-07-01 06:01:59	Waterpikmin	we may get a response tomorrow
2015-07-01 06:02:26	BetaMaster	If I get the time and am in the mood, I'll definitely try it out
2015-07-01 06:02:39	Waterpikmin	sounds good lol
2015-07-01 06:05:32	Waterpikmin	i dont believe you have animal crossing do you yoshi?

2015-07-01 20:40:51	@Espyo	I can always get it back

2015-07-01 20:57:27	@Espyo	so, the real problem of the "plants/fungi" article is the name
2015-07-01 20:57:35	@Espyo	I'm gonna go with "Plant and fungus" unless somebody opposes

2015-07-01 21:13:53	@Espyo	it does save it
2015-07-01 21:14:01	@Espyo	wait
2015-07-01 21:14:07	@Espyo	it saves it if there's an unexpected shutdown

2015-07-01 21:14:28	@J	I thought it always does

2015-07-01 21:14:38	UltraMario	what are we talking about
2015-07-01 21:14:39	@Espyo	it'd have purged it

2015-07-01 21:16:36	Testyo	"te" is not included in Hocotatian, so that part shouldn't be really pissed if after all this time, Wiimms SZS Tools did exactly what we wanted and more
2015-07-01 21:18:44	UltraMario	oh
2015-07-01 21:18:48	UltraMario	well i mean
2015-07-01 21:18:59	UltraMario	when you mentioned the fungi
2015-07-01 21:19:06	@J	oh
2015-07-01 21:19:09	UltraMario	what, was it part of a category or something?
2015-07-01 21:19:16	@J	[20:57:27] @Espyo so, the real problem of the "plants/fungi" article is the name
2015-07-01 21:19:16	@J	[20:57:35] @Espyo I'm gonna go with "Plant and fungus" unless somebody opposes
2015-07-01 21:19:19	UltraMario	or like an infobox
2015-07-01 21:19:25	UltraMario	oic
2015-07-01 21:19:31	UltraMario	makes enough sense
2015-07-01 21:19:41	Pidgey	how can something make 'enough' sense
2015-07-01 21:19:45	UltraMario	fungi doesnt have to be plants to be in the same article
2015-07-01 21:19:48	Pidgey	nevermind I answered my own question#
2015-07-01 21:19:53	UltraMario	lol

2015-07-01 21:37:59	@Espyo	yeugh...
2015-07-01 21:44:56	Pidgey	you don't add 241 bytes to a Trivia section
2015-07-01 21:45:08	Pidgey	it's approximately 241 bytes too much
2015-07-01 21:46:09	@Espyo	hehe
2015-07-01 21:47:20	@Espyo	that KidIcarus guy is going NUTS on the NIWA forums

2015-07-01 22:06:16	@J	well, I did the thing
2015-07-01 22:06:17	@J	http://niwanetwork.org/index.php
2015-07-01 22:09:30	@J	when is SGDQ BTW?
2015-07-01 22:15:05	Pidgey	hang on, I'm asking Google
2015-07-01 22:15:38	Pidgey	26th of July to the 1st of August
2015-07-01 22:15:39	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2015-07-01 22:15:47	Pidgey	st?
2015-07-01 22:15:50	Pidgey	oh, stone
2015-07-01 22:15:58	@Espyo	"the thing"
2015-07-01 22:16:06	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-07-01 22:16:09	@Espyo	uploading the secret
2015-07-01 22:17:36	Pidgey	I wonder what it is
2015-07-01 22:17:40	Pidgey	Banjo-Kazooie?
2015-07-01 22:18:01	@Espyo	only 3 days left
2015-07-01 22:18:23	Pidgey	speaking of Banjo-Kazooie, did anyone here give mon£y to Yooka-Laylee
2015-07-01 22:21:43	@Espyo	I didn't, but I'd be pretty inclined to
2015-07-01 22:21:51	@Espyo	never grew up with BK, but it seems like one hell of a project
2015-07-01 22:22:14	Pidgey	I gave £80 to the project, £70 for the tier and £10 for the shipping
2015-07-01 22:22:15	Testyo	£ 80 = 113.216 € / $ 123.088 
2015-07-01 22:22:20	Pidgey	oh hey
2015-07-01 22:22:33	Pidgey	are those continuously updated by the way?
2015-07-01 22:22:44	@Espyo	the wikis?
2015-07-01 22:22:47	Pidgey	the exchange rates
2015-07-01 22:22:55	@Espyo	oh
2015-07-01 22:23:00	@Espyo	no, I update them manually
2015-07-01 22:23:02	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-01 22:23:04	@Espyo	the last update was like a month ago
2015-07-01 22:23:07	@Espyo	so it's more or less reliable
2015-07-01 22:23:10	Pidgey	should change it now
2015-07-01 22:23:14	Pidgey	because of, y'know
2015-07-01 22:23:15	Pidgey	Greece
2015-07-01 22:23:31	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-07-01 22:23:34	@Espyo	when I remember, I will
2015-07-01 22:23:39	Pidgey	do so
2015-07-01 22:26:25	@Espyo	the point of that isn't so much so we can get accurate conversions
2015-07-01 22:26:32	@Espyo	it's more so we can communicate better in different regions
2015-07-01 22:26:38	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-01 22:26:40	@Espyo	like, if I need to tell you lot how much a game costs over here
2015-07-01 22:26:43	@Espyo	and I say it's 30€
2015-07-01 22:26:43	Testyo	30 € = £ 21.198  / $ 32.616 
2015-07-01 22:26:50	@Espyo	you'd be left wondering if that's a lot or really cheap
2015-07-01 22:27:01	@Espyo	it's good to have it precise, but it's a bit secondary *shrug*
2015-07-01 22:27:10	Pidgey	I suppose so
2015-07-01 22:27:26	Pidgey	either way I'd still have to make a Google search because it doesn't support SEK :p
2015-07-01 22:28:16	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-01 22:29:20	Testyo	I need a notebook to to make sure it actually sounds right
2015-07-01 22:29:39	 *	Pidgey gives Testyo a notebook
2015-07-01 22:29:40	Testyo	that's not editing the entire thing is difficult
2015-07-01 22:34:39	@Espyo	welp
2015-07-01 22:35:10	Pidgey	?
2015-07-01 22:36:20	@Espyo	Testyo's shenanigans
2015-07-01 22:36:21	Testyo	mhm, really that's neat

2015-07-01 22:56:19	Pidgey	why is /still/ no proper forum for Pikipedia and Pikmin Fanon
2015-07-01 22:57:53	@Espyo	it'd be pretty empty
2015-07-01 22:59:23	Pidgey	hmm
2015-07-01 23:06:10	@J	aw, I'm on holiday probably without internet most of SGDQ then
2015-07-01 23:06:26	@Espyo	ah, crap
2015-07-01 23:06:32	@J	hopefully the games I'm interested in are 26th-28th
2015-07-01 23:06:53	@J	also, Pidgey: you don't use Euros?
2015-07-01 23:06:59	Pidgey	no
2015-07-01 23:07:07	Pidgey	none of the Scandinavian countries use the Euro
2015-07-01 23:07:15	Pidgey	we all use our variations of the Krona
2015-07-01 23:07:31	Pidgey	SEK - Sweden, DKK - Denmark, NOK - Norway
2015-07-01 23:07:38	@J	hmm, okay
2015-07-01 23:08:41	Pidgey	the only Nordic country that uses the Euro is Finland
2015-07-01 23:09:32	Pidgey	I don't actually know what Iceland uses, maybe Icelandic Krona?
2015-07-01 23:11:46	Pidgey	and this is because, well, nobody here actually trusts the Euro to deliver
2015-07-01 23:13:26	@J	sure, I don't really understand or care about economics
2015-07-01 23:13:42	Pidgey	neither do I, just reporting the common opinion on it
2015-07-01 23:14:07	@J	in other news, it's been really warm here lately, especially for England
2015-07-01 23:14:13	@J	I think it was above 30C today
2015-07-01 23:14:14	Testyo	30 C = 86 °F / 303.15 K
2015-07-01 23:14:21	Pidgey	haha Kelvin
2015-07-01 23:14:49	@J	so I've been avoiding food shopping because too lazy to walk in the heat
2015-07-01 23:15:00	@Espyo	pseudo-heat
2015-07-01 23:15:04	@Espyo	just toggles between heat and thunder
2015-07-01 23:15:18	@Espyo	just as I was typing that, a British friend on skype said he got a thunder
2015-07-01 23:15:19	@J	we'll see which happens first, starvation or the end of summer
2015-07-01 23:15:47	@Espyo	you won't be able to resist
2015-07-01 23:15:49	@J	I think it is supposed to rain heavily tomorrow

2015-07-02 18:44:25	Yoshi2	is anybody else also melting in this weather?
2015-07-02 18:46:28	Pi	Sure am.
2015-07-02 18:46:44	Pi	It's 32C here, it's way too warm.
2015-07-02 18:46:44	Testyo	32 C = 89.6 °F / 305.15 K
2015-07-02 18:48:23	@Espyo	hi

2015-07-02 18:48:45	@Espyo	 35 is "toasty"
2015-07-02 18:48:52	@Espyo	above that is actually kinda uncomfortable
2015-07-02 18:48:54	@Espyo	but 32?
2015-07-02 18:58:21	Yoshi2	anything above 30°C is uncomfortable for me if there is no wind
2015-07-02 18:58:21	Testyo	30 °C = 86 °F / 303.15 K
2015-07-02 18:58:25	Yoshi2	being cooked alive is not fun
2015-07-02 19:00:48	Yoshi2	and the busses were HOT today
2015-07-02 19:01:19	Yoshi2	in one bus I was in, no matter what I touched, it was very warm

2015-07-02 19:01:22	Testyo	25 C = 77 °F / 298.15 K
2015-07-02 19:01:38	@J	I just walked 2 miles in it
2015-07-02 19:01:38	Testyo	2 miles = 3.2206 km
2015-07-02 19:02:14	@J	why is 6pm the warmest part of the day?
2015-07-02 19:02:15	Pi	I took the tram today, and the chauffeur told everyone that it was very important to regularly hydrate yourself. 
2015-07-02 19:03:09	@J	Yoshi2: okay, now I'm just envisioning you wandering around the bus poking everything
2015-07-02 19:04:11	Yoshi2	J: yup, I even poke the bus driver when he looks away :>
2015-07-02 19:06:13	Pi	Yoshi2: extremely lewd
2015-07-02 19:06:47	Yoshi2	:-)
2015-07-02 19:07:08	Yoshi2	Pi: at one train station some employees were giving out water to people who walked up to them
2015-07-02 19:09:08	Pi	oh, really?
2015-07-02 19:09:29	Yoshi2	yup, was quite neat

2015-07-02 21:59:15	@PikFan	because Fanon's policy is seriously lacking
2015-07-02 21:59:16	@Espyo	mhm?
2015-07-02 21:59:28	@PikFan	we never finished [[f:PikminFanon:Article Policy]], did we?

2015-07-02 21:59:49	@Espyo	I suppose not, no
2015-07-02 22:00:06	@PikFan	also, that policy needs to be split up for specific page types
2015-07-02 22:00:10	@PikFan	like on Pikipedia
2015-07-02 22:00:23	@PikFan	like game articles, cave articles, etc
2015-07-02 22:00:27	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-02 22:01:13	@PikFan	the game box thing down at the bottom, you mean like this? {{f:PCW}}

2015-07-02 22:07:33	@PikFan	though there's the likes of treasures and other collectibles
2015-07-02 22:08:02	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-07-02 22:08:17	@PikFan	Fanon also needs an area article policy

2015-07-02 22:16:35	@PikFan	I feel like all of that could be organized away into help pages
2015-07-02 22:16:50	@PikFan	...but it has to be followed, so I see why it's a policy
2015-07-02 22:21:07	@Espyo	sorry, had to be away
2015-07-02 22:21:25	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-02 22:22:15	@Espyo	also yeah, the "game box at the end" template is like that

2015-07-02 22:29:32	@PikFan	was afk
2015-07-02 22:31:09	@PikFan	oh, I had an idea for enemies
2015-07-02 22:31:26	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Awakening_Wood so here it says detail the location of each enemy, right?
2015-07-02 22:31:36	@PikFan	we should also say how many days it takes for them to respawn
2015-07-02 22:36:16	@PikFan	uh, Fanon doesn't need {{guide}}, right?

2015-07-02 22:37:08	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-02 22:37:37	@PikFan	well, we might need it later
2015-07-02 22:37:58	@PikFan	when we make fangames with your engine
2015-07-02 22:38:08	@PikFan	but that'll be far in the future
2015-07-02 22:38:48	@Espyo	quite far
2015-07-02 22:38:51	@Espyo	though speaking of
2015-07-02 22:39:02	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-07-02 22:39:03	@Espyo	today I did say about how the new AI system is important, although a bit invisible to the players
2015-07-02 22:39:18	@Espyo	thanks to the new AI system, I was able to implement gates into the game
2015-07-02 22:39:24	@Espyo	in just 4 hours
2015-07-02 22:39:28	@PikFan	wow
2015-07-02 22:39:34	@Espyo	I estimated 4 WEEKS
2015-07-02 22:39:47	@Espyo	just like that, boom, the engine supports gates
2015-07-02 22:39:59	@PikFan	uh
2015-07-02 22:40:10	@PikFan	so if you think it'll go like this for other things
2015-07-02 22:40:23	@Espyo	bridges will likely take 1 hour
2015-07-02 22:40:23	@PikFan	new update before July ends?
2015-07-02 22:40:26	@Espyo	well, sans graphics
2015-07-02 22:40:28	Yoshi2	it's awesome when new stuff accelerates development
2015-07-02 22:40:33	@Espyo	it really is
2015-07-02 22:40:42	@Espyo	I still have to do the leader AI, and that can take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks
2015-07-02 22:40:51	@Espyo	and I still have to add more stuff to make it feel better
2015-07-02 22:40:52	Yoshi2	but developing that new stuff (e.g. the AI system you mentioned) can take a lot of time
2015-07-02 22:40:56	@Espyo	it sure can
2015-07-02 22:41:01	@Espyo	but in my case, it was really important
2015-07-02 22:41:07	@Espyo	if the engine is meant to be flexible and allow any mob to do anything
2015-07-02 22:41:15	@Espyo	I NEEDED a more advanced AI system than what I had
2015-07-02 22:41:35	@PikFan	oh, how's the lite engine going?
2015-07-02 22:41:40	@Espyo	 0% progress
2015-07-02 22:41:45	@Espyo	 0% progress since the last update
2015-07-02 22:41:46	@PikFan	heh
2015-07-02 22:41:50	@Espyo	which was when it started
2015-07-02 22:41:53	@Espyo	that was more of a "what if"
2015-07-02 22:42:09	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2015-07-02 22:42:15	@Espyo	I'd love to do it though
2015-07-02 22:42:35	@PikFan	hey, the engine will be 2 years old in 11 days
2015-07-02 22:43:06	@Espyo	oh wow
2015-07-02 22:43:31	@PikFan	time flies...
2015-07-02 22:43:34	@Espyo	mhm...
2015-07-02 22:44:01	@PikFan	heh, I wonder what'll happen this summer
2015-07-02 22:44:18	@Espyo	well, I work all the same
2015-07-02 22:44:21	@PikFan	summer 2013: the fangame engine starts, Pikmin 3 is released
2015-07-02 22:44:27	@PikFan	summer 2014: the merge
2015-07-02 22:44:31	@PikFan	summer 2015: ???
2015-07-02 22:44:32	@Espyo	oh yeha
2015-07-02 22:44:34	@Espyo	*yeah
2015-07-02 22:45:01	@PikFan	it seems like the most exciting things happen in the summer
2015-07-02 22:45:17	@PikFan	but hey, it's summer
2015-07-02 22:45:25	@PikFan	exciting things are bound to happen
2015-07-02 22:45:37	@Espyo	yep
2015-07-02 22:45:58	Pidgey	like heat
2015-07-02 22:46:02	Pidgey	heat is an interesting thing
2015-07-02 22:46:17	@PikFan	especially record breaking heat
2015-07-02 22:46:26	Pidgey	how warm is it for you right now
2015-07-02 22:46:27	@PikFan	I don't mind it since I've got an air conditioner
2015-07-02 22:46:35	Pidgey	I don't
2015-07-02 22:46:35	@PikFan	95 F
2015-07-02 22:46:36	Testyo	95 F = 35 °C / 308.15 K
2015-07-02 22:46:49	Pidgey	it's not a European thing to have an air conditioner in your house
2015-07-02 22:46:56	@PikFan	what
2015-07-02 22:46:57	Yoshi2	I don't trust air conditioners
2015-07-02 22:46:59	Pidgey	well maybe southern Europe but not here
2015-07-02 22:47:08	@PikFan	that's really silly
2015-07-02 22:47:12	Pidgey	because I did see some when I was in southern Spain
2015-07-02 22:47:28	@PikFan	why wouldn't you have an air conditioner
2015-07-02 22:47:32	@PikFan	that makes no sense
2015-07-02 22:47:33	Pidgey	because Europe
2015-07-02 22:47:40	Pidgey	we don't like to make sense
2015-07-02 22:47:42	Yoshi2	I don't know many people with an air conditioner
2015-07-02 22:47:50	@PikFan	Europe ≠ sense
2015-07-02 22:47:53	@PikFan	on many levels
2015-07-02 22:48:02	@PikFan	but hey, so does America
2015-07-02 22:48:13	Yoshi2	but imo, the air conditioner would only be useful for those very hot days
2015-07-02 22:48:13	 *	@PikFan is a traitor
2015-07-02 22:48:36	Yoshi2	so most of the time, there is no point having an AC
2015-07-02 22:48:47	@PikFan	just leave it in the window
2015-07-02 22:49:00	@PikFan	you've got other windows
2015-07-02 22:49:04	Pidgey	no country makes sense though
2015-07-02 22:49:25	@PikFan	from a global perspective, yes
2015-07-02 22:49:26	Yoshi2	I ain't giving up on any of the windows
2015-07-02 22:49:31	Pidgey	and for the matter, no region makes sense
2015-07-02 22:50:16	@PikFan	anyway, but /why/ would you not use an air conditioner
2015-07-02 22:50:32	@PikFan	you'd rather die of sweltering heat than be nice and cool?
2015-07-02 22:50:35	@PikFan	...well, first
2015-07-02 22:50:38	@PikFan	I'll back uo
2015-07-02 22:50:39	@PikFan	*up
2015-07-02 22:50:46	@PikFan	how hot does it get in summer?
2015-07-02 22:51:00	Yoshi2	today's been 30°C
2015-07-02 22:51:01	Testyo	30 °C = 86 °F / 303.15 K
2015-07-02 22:51:23	@PikFan	does it ever get up to like 95 F
2015-07-02 22:51:24	Testyo	95 F = 35 °C / 308.15 K
2015-07-02 22:51:29	@PikFan	like where I'm at
2015-07-02 22:53:26	Yoshi2	according to a website I check the local weather on, it's been up to 34°C in the evening
2015-07-02 22:53:27	Testyo	34 °C = 93.2 °F / 307.15 K
2015-07-02 22:53:37	@PikFan	what
2015-07-02 22:53:44	@PikFan	...in the /evening/?
2015-07-02 22:53:54	@PikFan	as in, twilight hours?
2015-07-02 22:55:04	Yoshi2	or late afternoon
2015-07-02 22:55:10	@PikFan	yeah, that
2015-07-02 22:55:11	Yoshi2	around 7 pm
2015-07-02 22:55:49	@PikFan	but if it was 93 in the evening then it must've been like 100 F or higher midday
2015-07-02 22:55:49	Testyo	100 F = 37.7778 °C / 310.928 K
2015-07-02 22:56:11	Yoshi2	theoretically
2015-07-02 22:56:22	Yoshi2	but it feels like it's much hotter in the evening
2015-07-02 22:56:46	@PikFan	probably because it's more humid
2015-07-02 22:58:08	@PikFan	Espyo is sitting in the background like "silly kids"
2015-07-02 22:58:19	@Espyo	was away
2015-07-02 22:58:24	@Espyo	beetle in the living room
2015-07-02 22:58:28	@Espyo	dog trying to chase it
2015-07-02 22:58:29	@Espyo	fun stuff
2015-07-02 22:58:43	@PikFan	lovely
2015-07-02 22:58:51	Yoshi2	well, somehow I've survived the past couple of years without an AC, so I think I'll continue to be fine
2015-07-02 22:59:02	@PikFan	but you replied when I mentioned your name, no?
2015-07-02 22:59:09	@PikFan	coincidence? I think not
2015-07-02 23:00:00	Yoshi2	I do have a fan running all the time right now, though
2015-07-02 23:00:34	Pidgey	93F
2015-07-02 23:00:34	Testyo	93 F = 33.8889 °C / 307.039 K
2015-07-02 23:00:40	Pidgey	ok thank based Testyo 
2015-07-02 23:00:41	Testyo	let's safekeep the images and upload them one of things different in each game
2015-07-02 23:01:18	@PikFan	hey Espyo, do you play cookie clicker still?
2015-07-02 23:01:21	@Espyo	nope
2015-07-02 23:01:23	@Espyo	stopped months ago
2015-07-02 23:01:43	@PikFan	oh, because last night I had a dream about cookie clicker 
2015-07-02 23:02:44	@Espyo	hah
2015-07-02 23:03:03	Yoshi2	I'll go take a nap now before pikfan tries to sell me an air conditioner
2015-07-02 23:03:15	 *	@PikFan sells Yoshi2 an air conditioner
2015-07-02 23:03:17	@PikFan	:]
2015-07-02 23:03:25	@PikFan	no refunds
2015-07-02 23:03:27	@Espyo	oh!
2015-07-02 23:03:31	@Espyo	speaking of air conditioning
2015-07-02 23:03:36	@Espyo	I've been getting spam e-mails
2015-07-02 23:03:45	@Espyo	advertising installing air conditioning into your bus
2015-07-02 23:03:48	@Espyo	for the past few months now
2015-07-02 23:03:54	@Espyo	I don't even know where to start
2015-07-02 23:03:56	@PikFan	into your... bus?
2015-07-02 23:04:05	@Espyo	only 0.0001% of the world's population owns a bus
2015-07-02 23:04:16	@Espyo	why air conditioning? it's relevant now, but it wasn't 4 months ago
2015-07-02 23:04:26	@Espyo	why do they insist?
2015-07-02 23:04:28	@Espyo	I am just
2015-07-02 23:04:28	@Espyo	SO
2015-07-02 23:04:29	@Espyo	confused
2015-07-02 23:04:36	@PikFan	I would be too
2015-07-02 23:04:43	@PikFan	but still
2015-07-02 23:04:46	@PikFan	a bus???
2015-07-02 23:04:48	Pidgey	BUS?
2015-07-02 23:04:50	Pidgey	Why?
2015-07-02 23:04:53	@Espyo	it's
2015-07-02 23:04:54	@Espyo	I can't even
2015-07-02 23:04:58	Yoshi2	I freaking WISH they would install AC into some of the busses I have to take
2015-07-02 23:05:00	@Espyo	there are infinite things you could sell to people
2015-07-02 23:05:12	@Espyo	yeah, but rest assured, no bus owner will receive this e-mail
2015-07-02 23:05:12	Yoshi2	working AC
2015-07-02 23:05:15	Pidgey	The only thing I can think of is you doing multiple Google searches on data buses.
2015-07-02 23:05:19	@Espyo	plus it's the government that controls what goes into buses
2015-07-02 23:05:21	@Espyo	not bus drivers
2015-07-02 23:05:27	Pidgey	That is the /only/ logical explanation I have.
2015-07-02 23:05:28	@Espyo	and I don't think people actually OWN buses
2015-07-02 23:05:47	@Espyo	maybe? I dunno
2015-07-02 23:06:01	@PikFan	I don't know anyone that owns a bus
2015-07-02 23:06:18	Pidgey	Maybe they want to install ACs in data buses?
2015-07-02 23:07:01	Yoshi2	in Germany we have various companies running fleets of buses
2015-07-02 23:07:11	@Espyo	privately owned?
2015-07-02 23:07:13	Pidgey	I just thought of something
2015-07-02 23:07:21	Pidgey	WHY DOES GERMANY HAVE THOSE AWESOME THINGS
2015-07-02 23:07:29	Pidgey	THE TRANSPORTATION DEVICES THAT HANG FROM THE AIR
2015-07-02 23:07:50	@PikFan	this is funny because they actually kinda look like buses https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/PCIExpress.jpg
2015-07-02 23:07:50	@Espyo	...airplanes?
2015-07-02 23:07:55	Pidgey	I WANT THOSE YOSHI2 PLEASE TELL FRAU MERKEL TO EXPORT THEM TO SWEDEN
2015-07-02 23:08:04	Pidgey	no
2015-07-02 23:08:12	Pidgey	they function like trams/trains
2015-07-02 23:08:42	@PikFan	wait, Pidgey
2015-07-02 23:08:43	Pidgey	except /they hang from the air and go through cities and you are elevated from the ground/ oh gosh I love them why Germany /PLEASE/ export
2015-07-02 23:09:00	@PikFan	were you freaking out because Yoshi2 said _fleets_ of buses?
2015-07-02 23:09:07	Pidgey	no
2015-07-02 23:09:17	Yoshi2	ohh, that
2015-07-02 23:09:26	Pidgey	because he said 'Germany' and I thought of public transportation in Germany and then I thought of those
2015-07-02 23:09:33	Pidgey	then I was like I WANT THIS IN MY COUNTRY TOO
2015-07-02 23:09:44	@PikFan	is transportation in Germany like all futuristic and crap
2015-07-02 23:10:29	 *	@PikFan secretly installs an air conditioner in Yoshi2's living room window while everybody is ranting about transportation in Germany
2015-07-02 23:10:33	Yoshi2	hm, I don't think those suspension railways are that common
2015-07-02 23:10:35	@PikFan	mwahahaha
2015-07-02 23:10:37	Yoshi2	but they are cool though
2015-07-02 23:10:45	Yoshi2	the only one I used myself is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H_bahn_duesseldorf1.jpg
2015-07-02 23:11:02	Pidgey	I WANT IT

2015-07-02 23:33:04	Pidgey	you're correct in assuming Europe is in the middle of a heatwave right now

2015-07-02 23:37:57	@PikFan	I don't own a car!
2015-07-02 23:38:19	@PikFan	why are you putting responsibility on me
2015-07-02 23:38:29	@PikFan	I'm just a peon
2015-07-02 23:39:04	@PikFan	Pidgey: you don't like air conditioners so you'd rather face the heat and maybe have some people die?
2015-07-02 23:39:26	Pidgey	I don't even know anymore
2015-07-02 23:39:39	@PikFan	I probably misinterpreted that but eh
2015-07-02 23:40:55	@PikFan	huh, it looks like Spain is burning up, but Portugal — for whatever reason — is just fine
2015-07-02 23:41:38	@PikFan	whoa, supposed to hit 105F in Madrid on monday
2015-07-02 23:41:39	Testyo	105 F = 40.5556 °C / 313.706 K
2015-07-02 23:42:02	Pidgey	probably because Spain has so much inland, whilst if you're in Portugal you're always relatively close to the sea
2015-07-02 23:42:28	Pidgey	Because, y'know, Spain is the fourth largest country in Europe by area.
2015-07-02 23:42:37	@PikFan	but I did not know that
2015-07-02 23:42:41	@PikFan	but I do now
2015-07-02 23:42:44	Pidgey	It is only beaten by France, Ukraine and European Russia.
2015-07-02 23:42:48	@PikFan	so thank you for the information
2015-07-02 23:42:53	@PikFan	:D
2015-07-02 23:42:54	Pidgey	You're welcome.
2015-07-02 23:42:55	Pidgey	:D
2015-07-02 23:43:39	Pidgey	Oh yeah, and in that order too. I guess I should do top 5, so here goes: 1) European Russia, 2) Ukraine, 3) France, 4) Spain, 5) Sweden
2015-07-02 23:43:49	Pidgey	Not even kidding with that last one.
2015-07-02 23:44:23	@PikFan	because you live in Sweden?
2015-07-02 23:44:55	@PikFan	or is Sweden like tiny compared to the rest
2015-07-02 23:44:59	Pidgey	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_area
2015-07-02 23:45:18	Pidgey	There is a lot, and I mean _a lot_, of land in northern Sweden.
2015-07-02 23:45:26	@PikFan	I see
2015-07-02 23:45:35	@PikFan	and holy crap European Russia is giganti
2015-07-02 23:45:37	@PikFan	*gigantic
2015-07-02 23:45:57	Pidgey	Nobody can live there though, because it's freezing cold throughout the entire year.
2015-07-02 23:46:15	@PikFan	except for now, it seems
2015-07-02 23:46:18	@PikFan	wait
2015-07-02 23:46:25	Pidgey	>Russia
2015-07-02 23:46:25	@PikFan	did I check Russia? nope...
2015-07-02 23:46:30	Pidgey	>(including Crimea)
2015-07-02 23:46:32	Pidgey	best

2015-07-02 23:46:34	Pidgey	ever#
2015-07-02 23:46:48	@PikFan	why
2015-07-02 23:46:53	@PikFan	but that's
2015-07-02 23:47:00	Pidgey	Y'know the Crimean crisis?
2015-07-02 23:47:04	@PikFan	yes?
2015-07-02 23:47:15	@PikFan	oh, reference
2015-07-02 23:47:15	Pidgey	Apparently some maps are showing Crimea as part of Russia, not Ukraine.
2015-07-02 23:47:16	@PikFan	duh
2015-07-02 23:47:27	 *	@PikFan is so very slow
2015-07-02 23:48:14	Pidgey	I love how the smallest country in the world, The Vatican, and the largest country in the world, Russia, are all part of the same continent.
2015-07-02 23:48:40	@PikFan	because Europe is a land of superlatives
2015-07-02 23:48:52	Pidgey	mhm
2015-07-02 23:48:57	Pidgey	wait isn't that America
2015-07-02 23:49:04	@PikFan	????
2015-07-02 23:49:05	Pidgey	:PP
2015-07-02 23:49:12	@PikFan	I don't think so, no
2015-07-02 23:49:18	@PikFan	could be wrong
2015-07-02 23:49:20	@PikFan	very wrong
2015-07-02 23:49:25	@PikFan	I am wrong
2015-07-02 23:49:31	@PikFan	therefore fish
2015-07-02 23:49:35	Pidgey	yay :D
2015-07-02 23:54:26	@PikFan	hey 
2015-07-02 23:54:28	@PikFan	oops
2015-07-02 23:54:31	@PikFan	hey Espyo
2015-07-02 23:54:35	@Espyo	hmm?
2015-07-02 23:54:52	@PikFan	so you know how Pikipedia has an object list policy?
2015-07-02 23:55:40	@Espyo	mhm?
2015-07-02 23:56:21	@PikFan	I want to write a draft for an area article policy, but I'm not sure if there should be a section that lists just enemies, or other things
2015-07-02 23:56:30	@PikFan	like treasures, obstacles, etc
2015-07-02 23:56:39	@PikFan	everybody lists enemies
2015-07-02 23:56:47	@PikFan	some people make treasure names
2015-07-02 23:56:57	@PikFan	though I'm not sure if they list them in their area article
2015-07-02 23:57:53	@PikFan	[[f:Rugged Tundra]], for example
2015-07-02 23:57:54	Testyo	"Rugged_Tundra" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Rugged_Tundra
2015-07-02 23:58:14	@PikFan	I don't plan on naming treasures, so I've got enemies at the bottom, under the section Wildlife
2015-07-02 23:59:35	@PikFan	"There must be a section that lists all enemies, titled Enemies. If other things are included in this list, such as treasures or obstacles, then the section should be called Objects."
2015-07-02 23:59:46	@PikFan	how's that?
2015-07-02 23:59:53	@Espyo	does this really need to be so specific?
2015-07-02 23:59:58	@Espyo	I ask because any game can be made in any way
2015-07-03 00:00:00	@Espyo	like a game without enemies
2015-07-03 00:00:06	@Espyo	or a game with multiple categories of collectibles
2015-07-03 00:00:26	@Espyo	plus, the point of the policy would be to organize stuff so it doesn't get confusing with clashing shenanigans
2015-07-03 00:00:35	@Espyo	you can take it further, sure, but it's more limiting
2015-07-03 00:00:47	@PikFan	then just objects, in general?
2015-07-03 00:01:00	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-03 00:01:43	@Espyo	going now, night
2015-07-03 00:01:56	@PikFan	wait, hold on
2015-07-03 00:02:17	@Espyo	hm?
2015-07-03 00:02:26	@PikFan	"Any objects that appear in an area should be listed under a section called Objects."

2015-07-03 21:17:12	@PikFan	except for the story section
2015-07-03 21:17:52	@PikFan	maybe that could go, but I figured that areas have something to do with the story, regardless of the game

2015-07-03 21:19:25	@PikFan	thank you
2015-07-03 21:19:42	Yoshi2	heh, you're welcome
2015-07-03 21:20:02	@PikFan	have you heard of Racing for Rupees?
2015-07-03 21:20:12	@PikFan	it's hilarious
2015-07-03 21:20:25	@PikFan	and it was made with SFM
2015-07-03 21:20:28	@Espyo	what if the game doesn't have dungeons?
2015-07-03 21:20:32	@Espyo	literally over half of the canon games don't
2015-07-03 21:20:47	@PikFan	most fanon games do, though

2015-07-03 21:25:27	Pidgey	they are bad
2015-07-03 21:25:34	@PikFan	why are they bad?
2015-07-03 21:25:36	Pidgey	unconditionally bad
2015-07-03 21:25:44	Pidgey	because they can be baked into the main body of the article
2015-07-03 21:25:48	Pidgey	always
2015-07-03 21:26:03	@PikFan	but remember, most of these kids are like 12 year olds

2015-07-03 21:26:05	@PikFan	maybe less
2015-07-03 21:26:28	@PikFan	they're not going to spend time trying to figure out how to incorporate trivia tidbits into the article
2015-07-03 21:26:38	Pidgey	I don't even need to have played the game that the article is about or even know anything about the article I'm editing
2015-07-03 21:27:00	Pidgey	and I still am able to remove most points in a trivia section
2015-07-03 21:27:25	@PikFan	I still don't see why trivia is so bad
2015-07-03 21:27:33	@PikFan	on wikipedia, sure
2015-07-03 21:27:39	Pidgey	because, when put in the main body of the article, the article flows better
2015-07-03 21:28:03	@PikFan	but it doesn't have to be perfect
2015-07-03 21:28:20	Pidgey	fine, I suppose
2015-07-03 21:29:08	@PikFan	anyway, Espyo:
2015-07-03 21:29:53	@PikFan	what I was trying to say earlier is that I need to put a conditional into {{f:PCW}} so that I can choose if I don't want it to categorize on specific pages
2015-07-03 21:29:53	Testyo	"PCW" template = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:PCW
2015-07-03 21:30:05	@PikFan	but I tried that, and everything broke
2015-07-03 21:30:11	@Espyo	Trivia is, for the most part, bad
2015-07-03 21:30:21	@Espyo	our policy on trivia on Pikipedia tries to rectify it
2015-07-03 21:30:24	@Espyo	ideally, we wouldn't have any
2015-07-03 21:30:29	@Espyo	but it is true that everybody loves it

2015-07-03 21:34:40	@PikFan	>everybody
2015-07-03 21:34:47	@PikFan	but Pidgey doesn't like it
2015-07-03 21:35:05	Pidgey	I'm not part of the everybodies
2015-07-03 21:35:23	@PikFan	most of us aren't
2015-07-03 21:36:03	@PikFan	I'd go to say that everybody in this channel isn't part of the everybodies
2015-07-03 21:36:08	@PikFan	yay paradoxes
2015-07-03 21:36:34	@Espyo	hm
2015-07-03 21:36:49	@PikFan	?
2015-07-03 21:37:41	@PikFan	hey, have any of you got Ocarina of Time
2015-07-03 21:37:55	@PikFan	because I just bought it for the virtual console
2015-07-03 21:38:03	@PikFan	and everybody says the water temple sucks
2015-07-03 21:38:18	@PikFan	should I be concerned about the water temple?
2015-07-03 21:39:23	Yoshi2	you'll be fine, mostly
2015-07-03 21:39:32	@Espyo	I only learned it came out today
2015-07-03 21:39:37	@Espyo	because my youtube feed had some bug videos
2015-07-03 21:40:04	@Espyo	if you look at the water temple with a "aaagggh this isn't streamlined, screw you Nintendo" outlook
2015-07-03 21:40:05	Pidgey	the thing about the Water Temple is *two second pause* that everything *two second pause* takes a while because *two second pause* you have to *two second pause* open and close the menu *two second pause* a lot
2015-07-03 21:40:06	@Espyo	then you will get mad
2015-07-03 21:40:28	@Espyo	if you face the Water Temple as a temple you need to pay attention and explore in, it's pretty standard
2015-07-03 21:41:40	Yoshi2	it can be annoying having to wait for the menu to open and close while you change into the metal boots
2015-07-03 21:42:12	Pidgey	>This is the European version of the game with corrected aspect ratio.
2015-07-03 21:42:18	Pidgey	>This is the European version of the game
2015-07-03 21:42:22	Pidgey	>European version of the game
2015-07-03 21:42:27	Yoshi2	they fixed that issue in OoT 3D by making the metal boots an item that can be put on the item buttons
2015-07-03 21:42:36	@Espyo	Pidgey: ?
2015-07-03 21:42:39	Pidgey	Hello, beautiful 17FPS.
2015-07-03 21:43:24	@PikFan	so it's just the constant switching back and forth of the metal boots?
2015-07-03 21:43:29	@Espyo	heh
2015-07-03 21:43:30	Pidgey	Yes, PikFan.
2015-07-03 21:43:51	@PikFan	I see

2015-07-03 21:47:35	@PikFan	"This implies Koppai has an Earth-like interior, with convection, a magnetosphere, and a means of [[wikipedia:Outgassing|outgassing]] (such as volcanoes) to seal in and keep an atmosphere."

2015-07-03 21:47:55	@PikFan	I feel like Scruffy went into a little too much detail...
2015-07-03 21:48:08	@PikFan	but it does make sense
2015-07-03 21:48:10	@Espyo	hm
2015-07-03 21:48:13	@Espyo	always fun stuff to have
2015-07-03 21:48:17	@Espyo	this is why the Trivia exists
2015-07-03 21:48:23	@Espyo	you could add this to the body of the article
2015-07-03 21:48:27	@Espyo	...but could you really?
2015-07-03 21:48:32	@Espyo	not without it being plastered on for no good reason
2015-07-03 21:48:40	@PikFan	13:25	Pidgey	always
2015-07-03 21:48:49	@Espyo	nah
2015-07-03 21:49:27	Pidgey	Then again I also disagree with the spoiler policy here, and I think it shouldn't even exist in the first place, so, yeah. :P
2015-07-03 21:49:48	@PikFan	to each their own
2015-07-03 21:49:48	@Espyo	it's a bit iffy
2015-07-03 21:50:05	@Espyo	but you have to understand everybody reads the wiki
2015-07-03 21:50:13	@Espyo	I hate when I'm reading on something about one game
2015-07-03 21:50:18	@Espyo	and hello unwanted spoiler for a different game
2015-07-03 21:50:23	Pidgey	I argue that the template existing is bad for the articles.
2015-07-03 21:50:34	@Espyo	yeah, I don't like template bloat
2015-07-03 21:50:40	@Espyo	and I plan on doing something about it in the future
2015-07-03 21:50:48	@Espyo	but it only really is used in like 8 articles
2015-07-03 21:50:55	@Espyo	final bosses/treasures
2015-07-03 21:50:57	@Espyo	...pretty much it
2015-07-03 21:51:02	@PikFan	which template? {{spoiler}} ?

2015-07-03 21:51:07	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-03 21:51:30	@PikFan	more like 51
2015-07-03 21:51:53	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2015-07-03 21:51:53	@PikFan	though a lot of them are the /merge articles

2015-07-04 14:58:49	@Espyo	right
2015-07-04 14:59:04	@Espyo	pretty likely go with Pikipedia
2015-07-04 15:03:16	Yoshi2	would be odd to have a pikmin wiki admin go with a non-pikmin wiki
2015-07-04 15:03:36	@J	why?
2015-07-04 15:05:56	@Espyo	quite a few admins are multi-wiki admins
2015-07-04 15:06:04	@Espyo	http://www.niwanetwork.org/forums J, can you fix that "News:" bit at the top-right?
2015-07-04 15:07:59	@J	ooh, maybe
2015-07-04 15:08:06	@J	apparently I don't even see it by default
2015-07-04 15:14:41	@J	I'm struggling to work out how...
2015-07-04 15:15:25	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-04 15:17:33	@J	oh, I found it
2015-07-04 15:19:09	@J	done
2015-07-04 15:19:19	@Espyo	sweet
2015-07-04 15:19:19	@Espyo	thanks
2015-07-04 15:20:59	Yoshi2	Espyo: splatfest starts in 3 hours, woohoo
2015-07-04 15:21:04	@Espyo	sure does

2015-07-04 16:16:05	@J	I guess
2015-07-04 16:17:01	@J	yeah, seems fine
2015-07-04 16:17:10	@Espyo	I would go with "plant" too
2015-07-04 16:17:18	@Espyo	but DEEP DOWN, it's just not right
2015-07-04 16:17:25	@Espyo	I'll go with vegetation
2015-07-04 16:17:32	@Espyo	even if we find something better, it can always be changed again

2015-07-04 19:22:11	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-04 19:22:14	@PikFan	so we had an earthquake today
2015-07-04 19:22:29	@PikFan	I was sleeping, and then next thing I know, I felt my whole bed shake
2015-07-04 19:22:56	@PikFan	I didn't know what happened so I rushed to my mom, but she was so out of it she didn't feel it
2015-07-04 19:23:03	@PikFan	so I just went back to bed
2015-07-04 19:23:24	@PikFan	then I got back up about 15 minutes ago and I found out a 4.2 earthquake had struck

2015-07-04 19:26:23	@Espyo	woah
2015-07-04 19:27:02	@PikFan	mhm
2015-07-04 19:27:13	Pidgey	holy
2015-07-04 19:27:36	@PikFan	at least it isn't the 9.0 we've been expecting for the past few years
2015-07-04 19:28:06	@Espyo	woah
2015-07-04 19:28:34	@PikFan	but it's weird, because it was so far inland
2015-07-04 19:28:46	@PikFan	the nearest fault line is about 100 miles away
2015-07-04 19:28:47	Testyo	100 miles = 161.03 km
2015-07-04 19:32:55	Yoshi2_	Espyo: splatfest would be a bit more fun if I wasn't being disconnected so often
2015-07-04 19:33:02	@Espyo	same
2015-07-04 19:33:16	@PikFan	I really need splatoon
2015-07-04 19:33:19	@PikFan	REALLY need i
2015-07-04 19:33:21	@PikFan	*it
2015-07-04 19:33:25	@PikFan	just... no money
2015-07-04 19:33:50	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-07-04 19:33:59	@PikFan	Espyo: so I think I got a skeleton of the area article policy goin
2015-07-04 19:34:01	@PikFan	*going
2015-07-04 19:34:24	@PikFan	I... didn't really know how to expand on the details other than putting them in sentences, heh
2015-07-04 19:34:28	 *	@PikFan fails
2015-07-04 19:36:28	@PikFan	uh, is it okay to use "you" in a policy?
2015-07-04 19:36:36	@Espyo	it is
2015-07-04 19:36:54	@Espyo	PikFan: you're better off waiting until August
2015-07-04 19:36:58	@Espyo	when the biggest bulk of content comes
2015-07-04 19:37:06	@Espyo	right now, it manages to have some lackluster parts that make you go UGH
2015-07-04 19:37:21	@PikFan	heh
2015-07-04 19:37:36	@PikFan	wasn't half of the game not there at launch?
2015-07-04 19:37:53	@PikFan	and they've been slowly releasing updates
2015-07-04 19:39:02	Yoshi2_	Espyo: what parts make you go UGH?
2015-07-04 19:40:45	@Espyo	you can't play with friends on a bunch of the game modes
2015-07-04 19:40:51	@Espyo	you can't NOT play Splatfest, if you wanted to
2015-07-04 19:41:00	@Espyo	you keep disconnecting or having somebody else disconnect
2015-07-04 19:41:07	@Espyo	if somebody disconnects, the team is severely hindered
2015-07-04 19:41:19	@PikFan	*cough*get better servers Nintendo*cough*
2015-07-04 19:41:45	Yoshi2_	well, if somebody does have connection issues, there is nothing nintendo can do about that
2015-07-04 19:42:06	@PikFan	sure they can
2015-07-04 19:42:13	@PikFan	give you a better Wii U!
2015-07-04 19:45:12	Yoshi2_	hm, actually
2015-07-04 19:45:30	Yoshi2_	they could try something like grab a guy who is waiting for matchmaking and putting him in such a team
2015-07-04 19:46:52	Yoshi2_	Espyo: but I am not sure how playing with friends would work in a ranked mode without the enemy team being at a disadvantage if your friend happens to be on your team
2015-07-04 19:47:22	@Espyo	yeah, we figured that
2015-07-04 19:47:27	@Espyo	but it REALLY takes off the power a lot of the time
2015-07-04 19:50:09	@PikFan	Espyo: http://pastebin.com/wYWjsUSr
2015-07-04 19:50:14	@PikFan	it's really short
2015-07-04 19:50:54	Yoshi2_	but nintendo does have to do something about these server issues happening right now
2015-07-04 19:51:13	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-04 19:52:04	@Espyo	PikFan: sounds good
2015-07-04 19:52:34	@PikFan	the only part I wasn't sure about was "If only one type of object is listed, like enemies, then the section should be called just that object."
2015-07-04 19:52:44	@PikFan	that sounds a little confusing, no?
2015-07-04 19:52:57	@PikFan	but I couldn't word it any better
2015-07-04 19:53:12	Pidgey	Hmm
2015-07-04 19:54:02	Pidgey	This may be seen as pedantic, but if the enemy listed is a boss enemy, maybe there should be something that states that? What I mean is (enemy name) ('''Boss enemy'''), etc.
2015-07-04 19:54:37	@PikFan	oh, good point
2015-07-04 19:54:42	Pidgey	Or (enemy name) &ndash; ('''Boss enemy''')
2015-07-04 19:54:48	@PikFan	upgrade treasures, too
2015-07-04 19:54:53	Pidgey	mhm
2015-07-04 19:54:59	@PikFan	I'll add that

2015-07-04 19:55:43	@PikFan	ah, mhm
2015-07-04 19:55:52	@PikFan	I figured it would be Inkipedia
2015-07-04 19:56:48	@PikFan	most of us knew it'd be Inkipedia, but we said "Details unknown." to keep it a secret, right?
2015-07-04 19:57:11	Pidgey	I didn't know it was Inkipedia because I barely knew it existed.
2015-07-04 19:57:24	@PikFan	keyword: most
2015-07-04 19:57:32	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-04 19:57:37	Pidgey	you'd be correct there
2015-07-04 19:58:13	@Espyo	we did
2015-07-04 19:58:15	@PikFan	I was about to say "all of us" but then I remembered some of us might not know, so I changed it to "most of us" :P
2015-07-04 19:58:16	@Espyo	almost everybody knew
2015-07-04 20:00:03	@PikFan	Layout: This section describes the general layout of the area.
2015-07-04 20:00:11	@PikFan	it just feels so... lacking
2015-07-04 20:00:19	@PikFan	like, your policies feel nice and complete

2015-07-04 20:00:28	@PikFan	but this just feels like something hastily made
2015-07-04 20:00:32	@PikFan	oh wait, it was
2015-07-04 20:00:32	@PikFan	:P
2015-07-04 20:00:41	Pidgey	Yes, because that's b--- ninja'd.
2015-07-04 20:00:50	@PikFan	:D
2015-07-04 20:01:07	Pidgey	You could collaborate with Wraith on this, by the way.
2015-07-04 20:01:16	@PikFan	but he's nonexistant
2015-07-04 20:01:20	@PikFan	other than that one edit
2015-07-04 20:01:28	@PikFan	or am I wrong?
2015-07-04 20:01:33	 *	@PikFan checks Fanon RC
2015-07-04 20:01:43	Pidgey	Ah, so you're the only predominant bureaucrat on Fanon right now? 
2015-07-04 20:02:04	@PikFan	yep
2015-07-04 20:02:19	@PikFan	I've been the only one for like the past year
2015-07-04 20:02:21	@PikFan	or longer
2015-07-04 20:02:24	@PikFan	I lost track
2015-07-04 20:02:29	Pidgey	Do you have any decent Sysops to collaborate with, then?
2015-07-04 20:02:33	@PikFan	Espyo
2015-07-04 20:02:39	Pidgey	I guess so.
2015-07-04 20:02:49	@PikFan	and this other guy called Peach Bulborb
2015-07-04 20:02:51	Pidgey	Wait, he's a Sysop on Fanon, too?
2015-07-04 20:03:05	@PikFan	yeah, I gave him sysop status because why not
2015-07-04 20:03:09	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-04 20:03:42	@PikFan	he knows much more CSS and JavaScript than I'd ever know, so I figured it'd be useful if he wanted to get into the MediaWiki pages
2015-07-04 20:05:21	Pidgey	good decision then
2015-07-04 20:07:52	Pidgey	Personally, I don't know how I'd make the Layout section feel less basic.
2015-07-04 20:09:03	Pidgey	Hmm
2015-07-04 20:09:21	@PikFan	so I should leave it as is?
2015-07-04 20:09:47	@PikFan	I dunno, I feel like I'm overlooking something important
2015-07-04 20:09:56	Pidgey	Maybe include something about that if you've made a map, include it there.
2015-07-04 20:10:09	@PikFan	that's why there's Gallery
2015-07-04 20:10:18	@PikFan	speaking of maps, I actually drew one
2015-07-04 20:10:26	Pidgey	It makes much more sense to put an image of a map in the Layout section.
2015-07-04 20:10:35	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/5/57/Distant_Desert_map_01.jpg

2015-07-04 20:10:55	Pidgey	Because the map contains information directly pertaining to information a Layout section would contain.
2015-07-04 20:11:00	@PikFan	true
2015-07-04 20:11:09	@PikFan	only one though, right?
2015-07-04 20:11:21	Pidgey	Well, there are more ways to make a map.
2015-07-04 20:11:29	@PikFan	because I can't imagine shoving like several maps into one section
2015-07-04 20:11:39	@PikFan	unless if the section is enormous
2015-07-04 20:11:41	Pidgey	You can make a map like you've done there, but you can also make a topological map.
2015-07-04 20:12:34	@PikFan	"If there is a map for the area, it is recommended to put it in this section. If there are multiple maps, put one in this section and the rest in the Gallery."
2015-07-04 20:12:39	@PikFan	how's that?
2015-07-04 20:12:43	Pidgey	Sounds good!
2015-07-04 20:14:43	@PikFan	alrighty

2015-07-04 20:15:37	Pidgey	"A very brief description of the cave can be added, but it is not required."
2015-07-04 20:15:49	@PikFan	what about it?
2015-07-04 20:15:51	@Espyo	kinda ruins the purpose of a policy then
2015-07-04 20:16:10	Pidgey	*A very brief description of each cave should be found here
2015-07-04 20:17:10	Yoshi2_	apparently there are two other maps in the current rotation, but I've been playing on the same map for the past 5 times now
2015-07-04 20:17:11	@PikFan	meh, I'll do away with it
2015-07-04 20:17:20	@PikFan	nobody's going to add a description
2015-07-04 20:17:22	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2015-07-04 20:17:52	Pidgey	It can be added later on by other editors anyway.
2015-07-04 20:17:57	@PikFan	right
2015-07-04 20:18:32	@PikFan	it is their article, after all
2015-07-04 20:18:37	Pidgey	mhm
2015-07-04 20:18:40	@PikFan	wow I can't type today
2015-07-04 20:18:50	Pidgey	but you can
2015-07-04 20:19:02	@PikFan	first I wrote "is is", then I typed "afser"
2015-07-04 20:19:10	Pidgey	asfer
2015-07-04 20:19:15	Pidgey	what is asfer
2015-07-04 20:19:20	Pidgey	make that a treasure
2015-07-04 20:19:24	Pidgey	Asfer Jewel
2015-07-04 20:19:45	@PikFan	afser
2015-07-04 20:19:47	@PikFan	not asfer
2015-07-04 20:19:53	Pidgey	Afser Jewel, then.
2015-07-04 20:19:59	@PikFan	but I like asfer better
2015-07-04 20:20:08	@PikFan	I'm confusing
2015-07-04 20:20:17	Pidgey	humans are, in general
2015-07-04 20:21:53	Pidgey	The '''Asfer Jewel''' is a jewel made out of sulphur that has an azure colour.
2015-07-04 20:22:09	Pidgey	because this is fanon things don't need to make sense
2015-07-04 20:23:26	@PikFan	what doesn't make sense is that I can't connect to WiKirby

2015-07-05 14:46:39	@Espyo	it sees the ( in the URL

2015-07-05 14:53:37	@Espyo	I think it's more than just Mibbit
2015-07-05 14:53:46	@Espyo	URLs are meant to have those things encoded
2015-07-05 14:53:50	@Espyo	%29 or some such
2015-07-05 14:54:03	Yoshi2	good point
2015-07-05 14:54:08	@Espyo	so Music_%28Pikmin_2%29 or something should work
2015-07-05 14:54:19	@Espyo	otherwise you can only trust that a space is what ends a url
2015-07-05 14:54:28	@Espyo	which might not be exactly what the sender wanted
2015-07-05 14:54:42	@Espyo	still, most of the time you don't put a ( right after the URL, without a space
2015-07-05 14:54:46	@Espyo	so it's still stupid for Mibbit
2015-07-05 14:55:37	Yoshi2	detecting urls is a pain anyway
2015-07-05 14:56:42	@Espyo	sure is
2015-07-05 14:57:53	Yoshi2	whenever I see somebody writing an url detector for a bot, e.g. to show information on a link, they just look for a string that starts with http: or www. and take the rest of the string as an url until it reaches a whitespace

2015-07-05 21:44:55	@Espyo	no way
2015-07-05 21:45:16	Spark	aw, okay; thanks
2015-07-05 21:45:22	@Espyo	I guess you could add two bold tags

2015-07-05 21:45:36	Yoshi2	what color codes do you use?

2015-07-05 21:46:46	Spark	they're the same for most clients afaik

2015-07-05 21:58:46	Yoshi2	you could probably try using a color that is two digits
2015-07-05 21:59:03	Yoshi2	123 is my favorite number
2015-07-05 22:07:50	Pidgey	i dont have a favourite number

2015-07-05 22:13:53	Yoshi2	123 was just a test to show that you can put a number after the color if you use a color with two digits
2015-07-05 22:18:08	@J	can you put a 0 before the colour code?

2015-07-06 02:31:07	Pidgey	isn't that a Chess term
2015-07-06 02:32:13	En_Passant	yes
2015-07-06 02:32:26	En_Passant	You are the first person to identify that since I changed my username
2015-07-06 02:32:33	En_Passant	Most people don't even pronounce it correctly QQ
2015-07-06 02:33:37	Pidgey	what is that piece
2015-07-06 02:33:43	Pidgey	the most worthless of them all
2015-07-06 02:33:51	Pidgey	I don't know what they're called in English
2015-07-06 02:50:27	En_Passant	pawn
2015-07-06 02:53:27	Pidgey	ah yes
2015-07-06 02:53:36	Pidgey	thanks
2015-07-06 02:53:45	En_Passant	Wait what's your first language?
2015-07-06 02:53:49	Pidgey	Swedish.
2015-07-06 02:54:01	En_Passant	cool
2015-07-06 02:54:07	Pidgey	so yay for understanding six languages
2015-07-06 02:54:53	En_Passant	damn son
2015-07-06 02:55:06	En_Passant	What are the other four?
2015-07-06 02:55:51	Pidgey	well
2015-07-06 02:56:13	Pidgey	oh I guess that makes it five
2015-07-06 02:56:20	Pidgey	depending on how you count anyway
2015-07-06 02:57:10	Pidgey	Fluent in Swedish, almost fluent in English, automatic understanding of both Norwegian languages (Bokmål and Nynosk), and Danish. 
2015-07-06 02:58:39	Pidgey	I need to practise my Danish hearing comprehension, though.
2015-07-06 02:59:21	Pidgey	But it's so very hard to do that, considering that they don't even know how to signal where a word ends.
2015-07-06 03:00:58	En_Passant	lol
2015-07-06 03:02:43	--	Pidgey is now known as Pidgey|SLP

2015-07-06 05:32:26	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-07-06 05:37:14	En_Passant	That message appeared four times in a row
2015-07-06 05:37:33	En_Passant	Also, I'm bored and it was a good excuse to ping someone to talk to
2015-07-06 05:39:30	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-07-06 05:40:00	@PikFan	yeah, it's because I kept connecting and disconnecting
2015-07-06 05:40:46	@PikFan	for whatever reason, the wiki widget doesn't show people joining or quitting
2015-07-06 05:41:49	En_Passant	So what do you think of the Iridescent Flint Beetle's new design
2015-07-06 05:42:20	En_Passant	Because I thought of a redesign that looks a lot like the original, but I don't know if I dislike the current one enough to put the effort into drawing it
2015-07-06 05:45:36	@PikFan	in P3?
2015-07-06 05:46:23	En_Passant	yeah
2015-07-06 05:46:44	@PikFan	it's... interesting, to say the least
2015-07-06 05:50:40	En_Passant	My conundrum is that I don't think it looks anything like a beetle, but this is Pikmin so that's not a valid reason
2015-07-06 05:51:06	En_Passant	Is it?
2015-07-06 05:52:19	@PikFan	well, Pikmin makes no sense
2015-07-06 05:52:41	@PikFan	although beetles do have a hard covering
2015-07-06 05:52:56	@PikFan	and the IFB's have a hard covering
2015-07-06 05:53:16	@PikFan	maybe you could draw one with six legs
2015-07-06 05:54:30	En_Passant	Well, yeah
2015-07-06 05:55:06	En_Passant	It would be similar to the old design, but with updates that fit into P3's style
2015-07-06 05:55:18	@PikFan	mhm
2015-07-06 05:55:31	@PikFan	well, it's your call
2015-07-06 05:57:35	En_Passant	I think I'll do i
2015-07-06 05:57:36	En_Passant	*it
2015-07-06 05:57:45	@PikFan	alright
2015-07-06 05:58:06	En_Passant	I don't think the IGB (or the GFB as it will be called in Pikmin V) would look good with the current design
2015-07-06 05:58:44	@PikFan	I see
2015-07-06 05:58:55	@PikFan	what's the G stand for?
2015-07-06 05:59:01	En_Passant	Gilded
2015-07-06 05:59:12	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-06 05:59:16	En_Passant	Not quite as fancy, but it works
2015-07-06 05:59:44	@PikFan	actually, "gilded" sounds fancier
2015-07-06 06:00:02	@PikFan	because it's always been "iridescent"
2015-07-06 06:00:07	En_Passant	Well, not as fancy as the word Iridescent
2015-07-06 06:00:25	En_Passant	I originally wanted Illustrious, but that world has no relation to the word Lustrous

2015-07-06 06:03:01	@PikFan	nah, it's fine
2015-07-06 06:05:15	En_Passant	Something better to discuss would be Onions
2015-07-06 06:05:40	@PikFan	heh
2015-07-06 06:05:42	En_Passant	I feel like having a Master Onion for all 9 would be hard to make smooth
2015-07-06 06:05:58	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-06 06:06:34	En_Passant	I could do 3 of 3, though that + the two ships would make the landing site a bit too big for comfort
2015-07-06 06:06:54	@PikFan	well, just have like an arrow next to the 5th Pikmin type so you can go to the 6th, 7th, etc
2015-07-06 06:08:36	En_Passant	I guess I could
2015-07-06 06:12:41	En_Passant	Also, did you see the drawings I did
2015-07-06 06:12:48	En_Passant	Not trying to brag, but I'm really proud of them
2015-07-06 06:13:07	@PikFan	mhm, I did
2015-07-06 06:13:21	@PikFan	are they based off of the P3 designs?
2015-07-06 06:13:28	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-07-06 06:13:41	@PikFan	ah
2015-07-06 06:13:53	@PikFan	they look pretty good
2015-07-06 06:13:54	En_Passant	Why wouldn't they? They're the most recent
2015-07-06 06:14:02	En_Passant	*being based off of p3

2015-07-06 19:22:09	@PikFan	that's not right
2015-07-06 19:22:13	@PikFan	meh
2015-07-06 19:22:24	@PikFan	well, I made a todo list for Fanon
2015-07-06 19:22:58	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/User:PikFan23#Wiki
2015-07-06 19:23:15	@PikFan	I think I got the most important stuff
2015-07-06 19:23:50	@Espyo	sounds good
2015-07-06 19:25:15	@PikFan	as for the file licenses, I think we'd have to get into monobook.css or something
2015-07-06 19:25:22	@PikFan	I'm not sure how it all works
2015-07-06 19:25:31	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure it can't be monobook.css
2015-07-06 19:25:42	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-06 19:25:50	@Espyo	that's just the Monobook style
2015-07-06 19:25:53	@Espyo	what goes where, what colors
2015-07-06 19:25:58	@Espyo	what font size, etc.
2015-07-06 19:26:16	@J	file licenses?
2015-07-06 19:26:19	@Espyo	!
2015-07-06 19:26:20	@J	is that mediawiki:licenses?
2015-07-06 19:26:21	@Espyo	PikFan
2015-07-06 19:26:24	@J	something like that
2015-07-06 19:26:24	@PikFan	?
2015-07-06 19:26:29	@Espyo	one of your boxes says "alot of friends"
2015-07-06 19:26:30	@Espyo	ALOT
2015-07-06 19:26:34	@J	alot
2015-07-06 19:26:40	@PikFan	ugh
2015-07-06 19:27:47	@Espyo	anyway, yeah, I think it's that
2015-07-06 19:27:58	@Espyo	also, don't know if you guys noticed, but I closed the merging process
2015-07-06 19:28:00	@Espyo	(except for images)

2015-07-06 19:29:50	@PikFan	wasn't it like 1400 or something
2015-07-06 19:30:04	@Espyo	 1500 I think
2015-07-06 19:30:09	@PikFan	mm
2015-07-06 19:30:11	@Espyo	I deleted 550 or so pages
2015-07-06 19:30:16	@Espyo	so err... probably 1400+-
2015-07-06 19:30:27	@PikFan	uhh
2015-07-06 19:30:39	@PikFan	I thought we were keeping the /merge pages?
2015-07-06 19:30:46	@Espyo	what for?
2015-07-06 19:30:51	@Espyo	everything's all merged
2015-07-06 19:30:54	@PikFan	for history
2015-07-06 19:31:13	@PikFan	meh, never mind
2015-07-06 19:32:43	@Espyo	the history's on the normal pages too
2015-07-06 19:32:53	@Espyo	err, I think?
2015-07-06 19:33:06	@Espyo	well, the actual /merge page doesn't exist
2015-07-06 19:33:12	@Espyo	so its history doesn't need to be kept
2015-07-06 19:33:15	@Espyo	what we have is a hybrid
2015-07-06 19:33:16	@Espyo	that we made
2015-07-06 19:33:18	@Espyo	so we have our history
2015-07-06 19:33:23	@PikFan	by history I didn't mean the page's history
2015-07-06 19:33:37	@PikFan	I meant...
2015-07-06 19:33:38	@Espyo	that, combined with the fact that most of the people that did the other pages are with us now and don't care
2015-07-06 19:33:44	@PikFan	...I don't know what I meant
2015-07-06 19:33:47	@Espyo	heh
2015-07-06 19:36:27	@PikFan	so last night I cleaned up my game article a bit
2015-07-06 19:36:55	@PikFan	the wording is sounding better
2015-07-06 19:37:20	@PikFan	not like an 12 year old who created it, which it was
2015-07-06 19:37:29	@PikFan	it's sounding more professional now
2015-07-06 19:37:47	@PikFan	there's still some instances of "you" but I'll go through and weed those out
2015-07-06 19:38:24	@PikFan	and in the opening paragraph, I acknowledged that it's a fangame
2015-07-06 19:38:31	@PikFan	and it will probably never come out
2015-07-06 19:38:45	@J	I forget, did I actually merge the page histories then create a separate /merge page and put the old page back over the top?
2015-07-06 19:38:57	@J	in which case the history will be preserved, in the same page
2015-07-06 19:39:24	@PikFan	I forget too
2015-07-06 19:43:09	@Espyo	hehe
2015-07-06 19:43:20	@Espyo	wait
2015-07-06 19:43:23	@Espyo	oh, of course we did
2015-07-06 19:43:26	@Espyo	yeah, that's what happened
2015-07-06 19:43:35	@Espyo	the wikia pages got slammed on top of our pages
2015-07-06 19:43:40	@Espyo	so the history is intact
2015-07-06 19:43:46	@Espyo	then reverted, so we get the Pikipedia version
2015-07-06 19:43:48	@Espyo	then put on /merge
2015-07-06 19:55:32	@PikFan	and fanon is broken again
2015-07-06 19:55:33	@PikFan	yay

2015-07-06 20:01:50	@PikFan	so what's going on with Greece?

2015-07-06 20:06:47	Pidgey	so yeah the thing was basically a vote about austerity
2015-07-06 20:07:22	Pidgey	and the Greek people didn't want that, considering the youth unemployment is at 50%, or even higher

2015-07-06 21:42:57	@Espyo	I've seen people play it
2015-07-06 21:43:05	@Espyo	looks like one of those games that's a lot funner to play than to see

2015-07-06 22:15:58	Waterpikmin	so did anyone have any guess at what happened with omni?
2015-07-06 22:17:32	Waterpikmin	?
2015-07-06 22:18:10	Waterpikmin	espyo, do you know anything about what happened with omni? lol
2015-07-06 22:18:28	@Espyo	hm, not really
2015-07-06 22:18:30	@Espyo	he just never replied
2015-07-06 22:19:02	Waterpikmin	wow, thats strange, maybe he didnt reply because he didnt want any smashified characters getting leake
2015-07-06 22:19:06	Waterpikmin	leaked
2015-07-06 22:19:06	@PikFan	he probably doesn't care
2015-07-06 22:19:25	@PikFan	he probably thinks we're peons
2015-07-06 22:19:36	Waterpikmin	because they dont give out characters they want to smashify
2015-07-06 22:19:47	@PikFan	no, it's not that
2015-07-06 22:19:51	Waterpikmin	he may just give us credit in the video
2015-07-06 22:20:04	@PikFan	he probably has no interest in talking to wiki folk like us
2015-07-06 22:20:06	Waterpikmin	because he never gives out characters
2015-07-06 22:20:13	Waterpikmin	hmm... maybe
2015-07-06 22:20:27	@PikFan	in his eyes, we're insignificant

2015-07-06 23:03:18	@PikFan	I have come to a grand realization:
2015-07-06 23:03:25	@PikFan	Espyo just laughs at everything
2015-07-06 23:03:35	@Espyo	heh
2015-07-06 23:03:37	@Espyo	silly PikFan

2015-07-06 23:10:14	@PikFan	blatant lies
2015-07-06 23:14:17	@PikFan	oh, idea
2015-07-06 23:14:26	@PikFan	okay so
2015-07-06 23:14:38	@PikFan	you know how on Fanon, there's game banners for each game?
2015-07-06 23:14:49	@Espyo	yep
2015-07-06 23:14:56	@PikFan	what if we combined all of them
2015-07-06 23:15:06	@Espyo	...?
2015-07-06 23:15:49	@PikFan	so I'm thinking that it could be written out as like {{games|PCW|PET}}
2015-07-06 23:15:49	Testyo	"games|PCW|PET" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:games|PCW|PET
2015-07-06 23:16:01	En_Passant	Oh, a game banner template
2015-07-06 23:16:18	En_Passant	so {{game|name|maker|(opt)icon}}
2015-07-06 23:16:19	Testyo	"game|name|maker|(opt)icon" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game|name|maker|(opt)icon
2015-07-06 23:16:27	@PikFan	which would display as: This article applies to the following games: Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds; Pikmin: End of Time.
2015-07-06 23:16:31	@PikFan	with links to both games
2015-07-06 23:16:32	En_Passant	Where game is the Template
2015-07-06 23:16:38	@Espyo	hm, I see
2015-07-06 23:16:41	@Espyo	could work
2015-07-06 23:16:43	Pidgey	back from my walk
2015-07-06 23:16:44	En_Passant	Or that, I guess
2015-07-06 23:16:55	@PikFan	we'd just have to get ALL of the games
2015-07-06 23:17:03	@PikFan	...and update it for each new game
2015-07-06 23:17:04	En_Passant	I don't like that, actually
2015-07-06 23:17:09	@PikFan	Pidgey: long walk
2015-07-06 23:17:16	Pidgey	it was appropriately warm outside, at a comfortable 14C with a wind that made it feel about 8C.
2015-07-06 23:17:16	Testyo	14 C = 57.2 °F / 287.15 K
2015-07-06 23:17:27	@PikFan	8C
2015-07-06 23:17:28	Testyo	8 C = 46.4 °F / 281.15 K
2015-07-06 23:17:31	@PikFan	thanks Testyo
2015-07-06 23:17:32	En_Passant	Most game templates include the author
2015-07-06 23:17:32	Testyo	was there actually a pirate is all dat l need
2015-07-06 23:18:11	@PikFan	well, you can just find out who made a game by going to that game's page
2015-07-06 23:18:35	En_Passant	Yeah, but we're combining the banners, aren't we?
2015-07-06 23:18:46	En_Passant	The banners (meant to say that, not templates) include the authors
2015-07-06 23:18:51	@PikFan	combining and simplifying
2015-07-06 23:19:24	@PikFan	really, the banners' main purpose is to say "This game X applies to this article Y"
2015-07-06 23:19:34	@PikFan	the author thing is optional
2015-07-06 23:19:41	@PikFan	and then everybody just adopted it
2015-07-06 23:21:01	@PikFan	I thought of this because if we add game banner templates to all the articles, some articles might end up with a huge tower of templates at the top
2015-07-06 23:21:07	@PikFan	and we don't want that
2015-07-06 23:21:29	@PikFan	and it would have a consistent style
2015-07-06 23:21:38	@PikFan	no different colors being splattered everywhere
2015-07-06 23:24:31	En_Passant	Nobody puts their templates at the top
2015-07-06 23:24:38	En_Passant	They put them in the section for thei game
2015-07-06 23:24:43	En_Passant	*their
2015-07-06 23:24:48	@PikFan	some articles do
2015-07-06 23:25:25	En_Passant	Well, it sounds like the problem is that they're being put there
2015-07-06 23:25:40	@PikFan	even if it's spread out across the page, it still adds unnecessary height
2015-07-06 23:25:46	@PikFan	*even if they're
2015-07-06 23:26:19	En_Passant	Smashing them together doesn't fix that
2015-07-06 23:26:32	En_Passant	It's less space, but it's far more noticeable when they're all in the same place
2015-07-06 23:26:46	@PikFan	15:16	PikFan	which would display as: This article applies to the following games: Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds; Pikmin: End of Time.
2015-07-06 23:26:54	@PikFan	you could have more games
2015-07-06 23:27:01	@PikFan	and it would still be pretty small
2015-07-06 23:27:25	@PikFan	if you had a ton of games, it'd still be only three lines of text
2015-07-06 23:27:30	En_Passant	But it wouldn't look very nice
2015-07-06 23:27:38	@PikFan	I suppose not, no
2015-07-06 23:27:39	En_Passant	Lists are usually bulleted for a reason
2015-07-06 23:27:48	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-07-06 23:27:59	@PikFan	well, there's always the show/hide option
2015-07-06 23:28:25	@PikFan	open it up real quick to see the games in there, then collapse it when you're done
2015-07-06 23:28:49	@PikFan	or maybe multiple columns
2015-07-06 23:30:09	Pidgey	or hey
2015-07-06 23:30:13	Pidgey	nav templates
2015-07-06 23:30:16	Pidgey	they're handy to use
2015-07-06 23:30:44	En_Passant	That's a great idea, actually
2015-07-06 23:31:01	@PikFan	navboxes?
2015-07-06 23:31:07	Pidgey	navigational boxes
2015-07-06 23:31:08	Pidgey	yes
2015-07-06 23:31:11	@PikFan	you mean like a customizable navbox?
2015-07-06 23:31:12	En_Passant	Yeah, because they're collapsable
2015-07-06 23:31:19	Pidgey	so just have like
2015-07-06 23:31:28	Pidgey	{{f:CotW}}
2015-07-06 23:31:28	Testyo	"CotW" template = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:CotW
2015-07-06 23:31:28	En_Passant	And the not-collpased part is much smaller than a banner
2015-07-06 23:32:04	Pidgey	and that CotW template is a collapsible navbox of everything that can be found in Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds, for example
2015-07-06 23:33:01	Pidgey	and then you could have {{f:EoT}} for everything pertaining to Pikmin: End of Time
2015-07-06 23:33:01	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2015-07-06 23:33:01	Testyo	"EoT" template = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:EoT
2015-07-06 23:33:26	@PikFan	but again, you'd just end up with a ton of navboxes at the bottom
2015-07-06 23:33:40	Pidgey	yes, that's the point of navboxes
2015-07-06 23:33:41	@PikFan	although...
2015-07-06 23:33:45	Pidgey	but thing is
2015-07-06 23:33:47	En_Passant	It could be done at the bottom of each section
2015-07-06 23:33:52	Pidgey	you can make
2015-07-06 23:33:53	Pidgey	a template
2015-07-06 23:33:54	@PikFan	since it'd be at the bottom, it'd be less obtrusive
2015-07-06 23:34:05	Pidgey	like {{f:navboxes}} that would contain all navboxes
2015-07-06 23:34:06	Testyo	"navboxes" template = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:navboxes
2015-07-06 23:34:27	@PikFan	and then pass arguments for each individual game navbox
2015-07-06 23:34:31	En_Passant	Also remember that most of our users are like 12
2015-07-06 23:34:45	En_Passant	They won't know or care about advanced editing tools
2015-07-06 23:34:54	@PikFan	probably not, no
2015-07-06 23:35:10	@PikFan	ah, the joys of being a 15 year old
2015-07-06 23:35:15	@PikFan	you worry about everything
2015-07-06 23:35:44	Pidgey	that can be added later
2015-07-06 23:35:47	Pidgey	so yeah
2015-07-06 23:35:49	Pidgey	but also
2015-07-06 23:36:07	Pidgey	don't force the usage of {{f:navboxes}} unless there are enough navtemplates on a page
2015-07-06 23:36:08	Testyo	"navboxes" template = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:navboxes
2015-07-06 23:36:24	Pidgey	because for one, two, three or small numbers, it looks weird
2015-07-06 23:36:31	Pidgey	but for fifteen?
2015-07-06 23:36:34	Pidgey	then it's necessary
2015-07-06 23:37:06	Pidgey	I'm certain you'll find a guideline for this that fits the wiki
2015-07-06 23:37:13	@PikFan	this sounds like a good idea
2015-07-06 23:37:33	@PikFan	but I'm biased towards my idea because selfishness :P
2015-07-06 23:37:41	Pidgey	yeah :P
2015-07-06 23:38:10	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-07-06 23:38:20	@PikFan	never mind
2015-07-06 23:38:21	Pidgey	but this also means you have to create an entirely new navbox every single time a new game article is made
2015-07-06 23:38:28	@PikFan	right
2015-07-06 23:38:31	Pidgey	and new categories
2015-07-06 23:38:51	@PikFan	and also, you'd have to edit the navbox every time you decide to add a new article to it
2015-07-06 23:38:58	Pidgey	mhm
2015-07-06 23:40:16	En_Passant	I don't mind doing that
2015-07-06 23:40:26	En_Passant	Every game should have its own category anyway
2015-07-06 23:40:36	@PikFan	most games do
2015-07-06 23:40:57	@PikFan	good thing [[Special:AllPages]] is a thing
2015-07-06 23:40:57	En_Passant	The navbox would just be most of what's in that category
2015-07-06 23:40:57	Testyo	"Special:AllPages" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:AllPages
2015-07-06 23:41:09	@PikFan	*[[f:Special:AllPages]]
2015-07-06 23:41:09	Testyo	"Special:AllPages" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Special:AllPages
2015-07-06 23:41:11	@PikFan	oops
2015-07-06 23:41:16	Pidgey	Then we have the worrisome question of how you categorise pages.
2015-07-06 23:41:32	@PikFan	simple
2015-07-06 23:41:42	@PikFan	just do it like Pikipedia does
2015-07-06 23:42:33	Pidgey	of course
2015-07-06 23:42:36	@PikFan	if article X appears in games A, B, and C, then add categories A, B, and C
2015-07-06 23:42:40	Pidgey	man this reminds me
2015-07-06 23:42:58	Pidgey	I still don't remember the utterly confusing policies for categorisation on the mario wiki
2015-07-06 23:43:22	@PikFan	I should go through the enemy categories and rename them to <enemy> family
2015-07-06 23:43:26	@PikFan	like on Pikipedia
2015-07-06 23:43:55	@PikFan	do you still edit on mario wiki?
2015-07-06 23:44:12	Pidgey	yes
2015-07-06 23:44:21	Pidgey	but like
2015-07-06 23:44:29	Pidgey	just read it through http://www.mariowiki.com/MarioWiki:Categories
2015-07-06 23:44:30	Pidgey	it's a mess
2015-07-06 23:45:28	@PikFan	what http://www.mariowiki.com/MarioWiki:Categories#Category_Webs
2015-07-06 23:45:31	@PikFan	why
2015-07-06 23:45:47	Pidgey	blame Walkazo
2015-07-06 23:45:58	@PikFan	that whole policy could be SO much simpler
2015-07-06 23:46:02	@PikFan	it's so... bulky
2015-07-06 23:46:04	Pidgey	she's a great 'crat but likes to keep her explanations very wordy
2015-07-06 23:46:09	@PikFan	I'm not going to read through all that
2015-07-06 23:46:23	@PikFan	even I wouldn't be that thorough
2015-07-06 23:46:29	@PikFan	and I'm pretty thorough
2015-07-06 23:47:20	@PikFan	nearly 30K characters holy crap
2015-07-06 23:47:21	Testyo	30 K = -243.15 °C / -405.67 °F
2015-07-06 23:48:13	@PikFan	by contrast, [[Pikipedia:Policy]] is only 17K characters long
2015-07-06 23:48:14	Testyo	17 K = -256.15 °C / -429.07 °F
2015-07-06 23:48:23	@PikFan	...what?
2015-07-06 23:48:29	@PikFan	[[Pikipedia:Policy]]
2015-07-06 23:48:30	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Policy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Policy
2015-07-06 23:48:46	@PikFan	17K [[Pikipedia:Policy]] 
2015-07-06 23:48:46	Testyo	17 K = -256.15 °C / -429.07 °F
2015-07-06 23:49:05	@PikFan	hey Espyo, you should prioritize links over temperatures
2015-07-06 23:49:36	Pidgey	I think it's the wordiest one on the wiki
2015-07-06 23:49:43	@Espyo	good point
2015-07-06 23:49:48	@Espyo	what, our policy page is the biggest?
2015-07-06 23:49:52	@Espyo	[[Special:LongPages]]
2015-07-06 23:49:52	Testyo	"Special:LongPages" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:LongPages
2015-07-06 23:50:01	@Espyo	nope
2015-07-06 23:50:03	@Espyo	 114k
2015-07-06 23:50:04	Testyo	114 K = -159.15 °C / -254.47 °F
2015-07-06 23:50:23	@PikFan	no, not longest page for the whole wiki
2015-07-06 23:50:40	@PikFan	I meant, I think [[Pikipedia:Policy]] is the longest policy page
2015-07-06 23:50:41	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Policy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Policy
2015-07-06 23:50:45	Pidgey	I was talking about the mwiki
2015-07-06 23:51:04	@Espyo	ah
2015-07-06 23:51:05	Pidgey	I think there are no policy pages larger than the category policy page
2015-07-06 23:51:34	@PikFan	when 3 of the top 5 longest pages on the wiki have to do with Pikmin 2, you know Pikmin 2 is pretty big
2015-07-06 23:54:23	Pidgey	y
2015-07-06 23:54:26	Pidgey	es
2015-07-06 23:55:01	@PikFan	uuuuuuggggghhhhh
2015-07-06 23:55:09	@PikFan	Fanon needs a manual of style bad
2015-07-06 23:55:27	Pidgey	make one
2015-07-06 23:55:57	@PikFan	I would, but lazy
2015-07-06 23:56:23	Pidgey	oh yeah by the way we had a proposal over at the mariowiki for two years ago pertaining the spelling of 'mini-game' versus 'minigame'
2015-07-06 23:56:30	@PikFan	and this is why I don't understand how I am possibly a 'crat
2015-07-06 23:56:33	@PikFan	because I'm
2015-07-06 23:56:33	@PikFan	so
2015-07-06 23:56:34	@PikFan	lazy
2015-07-06 23:56:51	Pidgey	minigame won by the way, because less space = better
2015-07-06 23:57:00	Pidgey	so everyone now has to spell it 'minigame'
2015-07-06 23:57:02	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-06 23:57:16	@PikFan	yeah, "minigame" sounds better, opposed to "mini-game"
2015-07-06 23:57:22	@PikFan	awkward dash is awkward
2015-07-06 23:57:42	Pidgey	it's spelled 'mini-game' in certain cases but that's just when it's spelt that way in game
2015-07-06 23:57:53	@PikFan	...spelling "awkward" itself is awkward, because it's a W, then a K, then another W
2015-07-06 23:57:53	Pidgey	Mini-Game Coaster, for example.
2015-07-06 23:58:01	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-06 23:58:06	Pidgey	so those are exceptions
2015-07-06 23:58:13	@PikFan	here's a good one:
2015-07-06 23:58:23	@PikFan	internet: title case or lowercase?
2015-07-06 23:58:30	Pidgey	no we don't do [[Mini-Game Coaster|Minigame Coaster]]
2015-07-06 23:58:31	Testyo	"Mini-Game_Coaster|Minigame_Coaster" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Mini-Game_Coaster|Minigame_Coaster
2015-07-06 23:58:48	Pidgey	because that would be dumb
2015-07-06 23:58:51	@PikFan	Espyo: ?
2015-07-06 23:58:58	En_Passant	Fanon has policies
2015-07-06 23:59:10	@PikFan	yes, it does
2015-07-06 23:59:14	@PikFan	but not nearly enough
2015-07-06 23:59:18	En_Passant	But none of our members gives any craps about them
2015-07-06 23:59:38	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-07-06 23:59:44	@Espyo	huh?
2015-07-06 23:59:50	En_Passant	There's not much we can do about that
2015-07-06 23:59:54	@PikFan	15:57	Espyo	hmm
2015-07-06 23:59:59	@PikFan	well, we can
2015-07-07 00:00:10	@Espyo	just reading
2015-07-07 00:00:11	@PikFan	I can just give out a bunch of warnings to everybody
2015-07-07 00:00:24	@PikFan	and block them if they don't comply
2015-07-07 00:00:30	@PikFan	but I don't feel like doing that :P
2015-07-07 00:00:41	@PikFan	oh, and also delete their articles
2015-07-07 00:01:11	@PikFan	the policies aren't followed because nobody enforces them
2015-07-07 00:01:22	@PikFan	bad PikFan is bad
2015-07-07 00:01:53	@PikFan	also, I guess it's because I'm basically the only active admin
2015-07-07 00:02:23	@PikFan	and managing a whole wiki is pretty overwhelming when it's just by yourself
2015-07-07 00:02:36	@PikFan	even if it's inactive
2015-07-07 00:02:53	@Espyo	it's hard for everybody to know every policy
2015-07-07 00:03:04	@Espyo	so only start giving warnings after people disobey them blatantly
2015-07-07 00:03:09	@Espyo	specially after they're warned not to
2015-07-07 00:03:13	@Espyo	but don't warned them from the start
2015-07-07 00:03:20	@Espyo	you want it to be a wiki where people can dump their ideas
2015-07-07 00:03:32	@Espyo	not doing the taxes for a book club

2015-07-07 00:03:50	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-07 00:03:53	@PikFan	that's the thing
2015-07-07 00:04:10	@PikFan	it's because of Fanon's open nature that I don't really do anything
2015-07-07 00:04:39	En_Passant	I feel like we need to up our game
2015-07-07 00:04:47	@PikFan	(that was another reason, but it was buried deep in my mind until Espyo revived me)
2015-07-07 00:04:58	@PikFan	we do
2015-07-07 00:05:08	@PikFan	just so little motivation
2015-07-07 00:05:23	@PikFan	and, like always, what will we get out of this discussion?
2015-07-07 00:05:27	@PikFan	probably nothing
2015-07-07 00:05:46	@PikFan	other than more shared ideas...
2015-07-07 00:06:26	@PikFan	why is Fanon even a thing anymore...
2015-07-07 00:06:36	@PikFan	I'm beginning to question its existence
2015-07-07 00:08:07	@Espyo	it's a gradual process
2015-07-07 00:08:15	@Espyo	don't think you can discuss the whole table of solutions in one goe

2015-07-07 00:08:28	@PikFan	heh
2015-07-07 00:11:16	En_Passant	How long has this wiki been in existence?
2015-07-07 00:11:24	En_Passant	And how many failed reform attempts have we had?
2015-07-07 00:11:45	@PikFan	since late 2008
2015-07-07 00:11:49	@PikFan	and too many to count
2015-07-07 00:12:10	@PikFan	oh, that reminds me
2015-07-07 00:12:20	@PikFan	Pikipedia turns 10 years old this December
2015-07-07 00:12:26	Pidgey	ten years
2015-07-07 00:12:30	@PikFan	we should do something special for the anniversary
2015-07-07 00:12:49	Pidgey	almost the same as mariowiki, actually
2015-07-07 00:12:53	Pidgey	except that happens in August

2015-07-07 20:59:16	@PikFan	nobody would upload a file like that

2015-07-07 21:09:18	@PikFan	have any of you ever been roller skating before

2015-07-07 21:10:17	@Espyo	...there are a lot of Ryans on skype

2015-07-07 21:10:32	@Espyo	nah, it should be fine, specially with helmets and such
2015-07-07 21:10:36	@Espyo	worst that can happen is you falling
2015-07-07 21:10:43	@Espyo	unless you fall from a wall, no you won't break anything
2015-07-07 21:11:03	@PikFan	my friend says ice skating is worse
2015-07-07 21:11:17	@Espyo	sure is
2015-07-07 21:11:17	@PikFan	apparently one time somebody's finger got cut off
2015-07-07 21:11:22	@Espyo	you're walking on blades
2015-07-07 21:16:44	Klemen702	finger cut off for going skating? how exactly?
2015-07-07 21:17:07	@Espyo	again, you're walking on blades
2015-07-07 21:17:18	@Espyo	if somebody skates over your fingers lying on the ground...

2015-07-07 21:17:36	@PikFan	that's a great sound effect word
2015-07-07 21:17:39	Klemen702	why would someone have fingers on the ground? :P
2015-07-07 21:17:47	@PikFan	if they fell over
2015-07-07 21:18:16	Klemen702	so his fingers got cut off because of 2 coincidences?
2015-07-07 21:19:08	Klemen702	hmm, [[]]:P i wonder if this will work here too
2015-07-07 21:19:10	Klemen702	nope
2015-07-07 21:19:13	Klemen702	wikia only
2015-07-07 21:20:31	@Espyo	PikFan: onomatopoeia
2015-07-07 21:20:42	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-07-07 21:20:46	@Espyo	what do you mean wikia only?
2015-07-07 21:21:34	Klemen702	on wikia things like these :P become emoticons, but you can make it not happen by typing [[]] before it
2015-07-07 21:22:04	@Espyo	that's so confusing
2015-07-07 21:22:07	@Espyo	like

2015-07-07 23:10:57	@Espyo	sigh...
2015-07-07 23:10:59	@PikFan	is this a different thing from AI, or is it related?
2015-07-07 23:11:07	@Espyo	the same AI system
2015-07-07 23:11:11	UltraMario	hey pikfan
2015-07-07 23:11:13	@Espyo	I'm just teaching the leaders how to work with it

2015-07-07 23:11:34	UltraMario	are you guys hyped for Mario Maker?
2015-07-07 23:11:36	@PikFan	I thought you said the AI system was easy to work with?
2015-07-07 23:11:41	@Espyo	it is
2015-07-07 23:11:41	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-07 23:11:45	@Espyo	but it's a bit long, regardless
2015-07-07 23:11:51	UltraMario	I know I am :D
2015-07-07 23:12:01	@Espyo	I think it'll be nice, but I won't be getting it
2015-07-07 23:12:06	@Espyo	can't go around buying every Wii U title
2015-07-07 23:12:08	@PikFan	nightmares from hell will be made with it
2015-07-07 23:12:14	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-07 23:12:38	UltraMario	i probably won't be that great at making my own levels, but i could still recreate classic mario levels
2015-07-07 23:13:01	Pidgey	apparently you have to finish the levels you create before they can be published to the public
2015-07-07 23:13:12	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-07 23:13:17	Pidgey	so if you make it too hard, you can't even get it out there
2015-07-07 23:13:24	@Espyo	hah, awesome
2015-07-07 23:13:28	UltraMario	that'll be hard to do when i get to recreating lost levels :p
2015-07-07 23:13:31	Pidgey	and as such, this prevents impossible levels to be created
2015-07-07 23:13:37	@PikFan	but there's crazy people who can easily beat their own levels
2015-07-07 23:14:08	@PikFan	all you have to do is reach the goal post, right?

2015-07-07 23:16:09	UltraMario	i wonder if you can play as luigi
2015-07-07 23:16:22	UltraMario	i dont mean as an amiibo costume
2015-07-07 23:16:35	@Espyo	maybe after completing the stock levels
2015-07-07 23:16:41	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard to put him in the game
2015-07-07 23:17:00	UltraMario	yeah
2015-07-07 23:17:12	UltraMario	i dont want him as a mario reskin
2015-07-07 23:17:13	@PikFan	Mario Maker is pretty much Nintendo's response to all the NSMB hacks
2015-07-07 23:17:41	UltraMario	well i mean its just a response to level maker stuff in gener
2015-07-07 23:17:43	UltraMario	al
2015-07-07 23:17:59	UltraMario	ive been waiting for something like this for awhile
2015-07-07 23:18:09	UltraMario	speaking of amiibo costumes
2015-07-07 23:18:27	UltraMario	too bad they can't be used outside smb1
2015-07-07 23:19:02	UltraMario	also apparently dlc objects and enemies aren't planned
2015-07-07 23:19:18	UltraMario	im juat hoping dlc game templates are added
2015-07-07 23:19:33	UltraMario	it could use some mario all-stars
2015-07-07 23:20:07	@PikFan	I will never buy an amiibo
2015-07-07 23:20:16	@PikFan	DLC is enough
2015-07-07 23:20:32	UltraMario	I like amiibo
2015-07-07 23:20:38	@PikFan	well good for you
2015-07-07 23:21:25	@PikFan	amiibo is just another gimmick
2015-07-07 23:21:33	@PikFan	we don't need gimmicks, Nintendo
2015-07-07 23:21:36	UltraMario	i do more obvious recreations, ill do stuff like Super Mario Bros. Special, New Super Mario Bros. multiplayer courses, NSMBW and NSMBU coin battle courses, NSMBU challenge mode courses, and World e from SMA4
2015-07-07 23:21:42	@PikFan	we just need traditional games
2015-07-07 23:21:42	UltraMario	amiibo is cool
2015-07-07 23:21:55	UltraMario	well they're not that expensive
2015-07-07 23:22:20	UltraMario	i mean, if theyre not the rare ones, lol
2015-07-07 23:22:24	@PikFan	are you kidding? I'm not paying 13$ for an electronic action figure
2015-07-07 23:22:38	UltraMario	good for you :S
2015-07-07 23:22:41	@PikFan	they're basically a quarter the cost of a full blown Wii U game
2015-07-07 23:22:49	@PikFan	*$13
2015-07-07 23:22:57	@PikFan	...
2015-07-07 23:22:59	@PikFan	$13
2015-07-07 23:23:00	Testyo	$ 13 = 11.9561 € / £ 8.4487 
2015-07-07 23:23:17	UltraMario	its only more costly because they work with more than one game, so they do more than skylanders
2015-07-07 23:23:25	UltraMario	i likw that approach
2015-07-07 23:23:47	@PikFan	I thought you had to erase the data on an amiibo if you wanted to use it for another game
2015-07-07 23:24:04	@PikFan	ugh
2015-07-07 23:24:08	UltraMario	well it depends
2015-07-07 23:24:10	UltraMario	like
2015-07-07 23:24:20	@PikFan	if there's amiibo that works with Pikmin 4, I'm killing someone
2015-07-07 23:24:31	UltraMario	if it just adds something like costumes like in mk8
2015-07-07 23:24:39	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-07 23:24:40	UltraMario	that doesn't erase anything
2015-07-07 23:24:43	@Espyo	Smash 4 loads and saves data
2015-07-07 23:24:47	@Espyo	your amiibo fighter data
2015-07-07 23:24:54	@Espyo	which includes name, color, custom moves, custom equipment, etc.
2015-07-07 23:24:58	@Espyo	for Mario Kart 8 and such
2015-07-07 23:24:59	UltraMario	if its something like amiino party it loads and saves
2015-07-07 23:25:00	@Espyo	you just tap it
2015-07-07 23:25:05	@Espyo	the game is like "oh, you have this amiibo"
2015-07-07 23:25:10	@Espyo	"all right, I'll unlock this costume inside the game"
2015-07-07 23:25:11	@PikFan	hmm
2015-07-07 23:25:14	@Espyo	and does nothing to the amiibo itself
2015-07-07 23:25:27	UltraMario	you can find more info about what games load and save on the amiibo website
2015-07-07 23:25:46	@PikFan	seems like Smash is the only game that intensively uses amiibo
2015-07-07 23:25:56	UltraMario	no
2015-07-07 23:26:01	@Espyo	there was another...
2015-07-07 23:26:03	@Espyo	can't remember which one
2015-07-07 23:26:03	UltraMario	Splatoon does
2015-07-07 23:26:10	UltraMario	also so far my favorite game that has amiibo functionality is Splatoon
2015-07-07 23:26:20	UltraMario	it adds replay value
2015-07-07 23:26:20	@Espyo	yeah, but it doesn't save
2015-07-07 23:26:20	@Espyo	does it?
2015-07-07 23:26:23	UltraMario	idk
2015-07-07 23:26:33	UltraMario	but it has like missions and stuff
2015-07-07 23:26:39	UltraMario	it's cool
2015-07-07 23:27:03	@PikFan	hey UM, how many Wii U games do you have?
2015-07-07 23:27:18	UltraMario	oh, uh
2015-07-07 23:27:23	UltraMario	well
2015-07-07 23:27:41	UltraMario	do you mean as in disc games or eshop or both

2015-07-08 19:43:32	@J	the sheer craziness
2015-07-08 19:44:30	Yoshi2	isn't that the person who posted in 5 year old threads?
2015-07-08 19:45:50	Yoshi2	yup, it was
2015-07-08 19:46:42	@J	and is continuing to do so
2015-07-08 19:46:46	@J	even as he makes that one
2015-07-08 19:46:47	@J	why
2015-07-08 19:47:28	@J	it's like he's just saying, "guys, I'm accidentallying all over the place and I need help"
2015-07-08 19:48:41	Yoshi2	I'm really considering creating an account there just so I can call that person out
2015-07-08 19:49:04	Yoshi2	but that would probably look weird

2015-07-08 20:16:30	Yoshi2	J: "I'm all over the place" seems about right
2015-07-08 20:25:30	Yoshi2	the NIWA forum doesn't even seem to have that many threads
2015-07-08 20:25:58	Yoshi2	and that person managed to post in every single one of them

2015-07-08 20:29:15	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	why can't you just warn him for spamming the forums
2015-07-08 20:29:20	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	you /are/ a mod there after all
2015-07-08 20:31:58	@J	yeah...
2015-07-08 20:32:18	@J	I'm kind of suspecting that the reason he created that topic is because another mod warned him already
2015-07-08 20:32:32	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	wait why don't you know this
2015-07-08 20:32:47	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	why don't you immediately know when a user is being warned from another mod
2015-07-08 20:34:57	Yoshi2	mhm, if an actual warning was issued, I'd assume a mod would be able to check that
2015-07-08 20:35:24	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	no I don't mean though that
2015-07-08 20:35:26	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	*through
2015-07-08 20:35:46	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	surely you must have a special board that only administrators of the board have access to where you discuss warnings and such
2015-07-08 20:36:16	Yoshi2	ah
2015-07-08 20:36:54	Yoshi2	a sort of communication channel just for staff members
2015-07-08 20:37:44	Yoshi2	well, I guess that requires creating a thread there and asking around
2015-07-08 20:37:52	Yoshi2	then waiting for the response
2015-07-08 20:40:30	@Espyo	that guy
2015-07-08 20:45:03	@J	not really
2015-07-08 20:45:17	@J	the place is pretty dead really
2015-07-08 20:45:24	@J	had hardly any posts until that guy started
2015-07-08 20:52:58	Pidgey|Banjo-Tooie	ah
2015-07-08 21:06:26	Yoshi2	I assume staff boards are more often used when there is a lot of activity in the forum

2015-07-08 23:34:29	@Espyo	oh, like that
2015-07-08 23:34:36	@Espyo	don't get me wrong, still pretty kickass
2015-07-08 23:34:43	@Espyo	but I actually imagined the full game emulated at first
2015-07-08 23:35:13	@J	yeah
2015-07-08 23:35:21	@Espyo	it's so interesting to see
2015-07-08 23:35:25	@Espyo	I don't play the game, and I LOVE this
2015-07-08 23:35:34	@J	when I heard about it, I was thinking it showed the actions you did, not the map
2015-07-08 23:35:39	@J	which in hindsight would be kind of weird
2015-07-08 23:35:44	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-08 23:35:50	@J	but yeah, the idea is really interesting
2015-07-08 23:36:15	@J	also the website can be a proxy against the real leaderboards servers, and instead of saving just your best replays, it saves them all
2015-07-08 23:36:50	@Espyo	right
2015-07-08 23:36:57	@J	anyway, there are no in-game ghosts or multiple replay viewing, so this should help if I can't work out why I'm so slow
2015-07-08 23:37:07	@J	although the answer is probably just I'm bad
2015-07-08 23:37:12	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2015-07-08 23:37:52	@J	anyway, I should sleep, goodnight

2015-07-09 18:59:20	Yoshi2	because region locking is awesome

2015-07-10 15:44:25	@PikFan	mhm, that's what I planned on doing
2015-07-10 15:44:31	@PikFan	thanks anyway
2015-07-10 15:45:13	@PikFan	so I've been up for nearly 19 hours
2015-07-10 15:45:29	Pidgey	sleep
2015-07-10 15:45:46	@PikFan	trying to go for 24 hours
2015-07-10 15:45:55	@PikFan	so... no :P
2015-07-10 15:46:15	@PikFan	it's a challenge I like to try every summer

2015-07-10 17:34:11	Yoshi2_	PikFan: what are you planning to do after you have finished the challenge?
2015-07-10 17:37:30	@PikFan	sleep, duh
2015-07-10 17:38:05	@PikFan	or maybe stay up a little longer
2015-07-10 17:38:15	@PikFan	to set a personal record
2015-07-10 17:38:39	@PikFan	depends on how I feel then
2015-07-10 17:38:46	@PikFan	which is in 3.5 hours
2015-07-10 17:38:55	Pidgey	My personal record is around 39 hours, I believe.
2015-07-10 17:39:20	Pidgey	Then I slept for eight hours, and everything was suddenly okay.
2015-07-10 17:39:34	@PikFan	what
2015-07-10 17:39:47	@PikFan	...eight hours? only eight?
2015-07-10 17:39:51	Pidgey	Yup.
2015-07-10 17:40:04	Pidgey	My body just couldn't sleep anymore, that's how it went down.
2015-07-10 17:40:14	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-10 17:40:22	@PikFan	how deep in a sleep were you
2015-07-10 17:40:28	Pidgey	Very, very deep.
2015-07-10 17:40:36	@PikFan	ah, that makes more sense
2015-07-10 17:40:57	Yoshi2_	I've been trying to sleep for more than 8 hours
2015-07-10 17:40:59	Yoshi2_	doesn't work
2015-07-10 17:41:11	@PikFan	it's because you're an adult
2015-07-10 17:41:13	Pidgey	It also felt like a dreamless night, but we all know that's just codswallop.
2015-07-10 17:41:24	@PikFan	codswallop
2015-07-10 17:41:27	@PikFan	new favorite word
2015-07-10 17:42:01	Pidgey	Yes, it's a thing that Hagrid says in the British version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when he mentions that everyone thinks Voldemort is dead.
2015-07-10 17:42:21	@PikFan	I am a muggle, so I wouldn't know :P
2015-07-10 17:42:26	Pidgey	haha
2015-07-10 17:42:51	@PikFan	and I only know what muggle means because of my friends
2015-07-10 17:43:12	@PikFan	otherwise... I'd be too much of a muggle to know what a muggle is
2015-07-10 17:43:13	Pidgey	But it /is/ an official word in the English language, though.
2015-07-10 17:43:30	@PikFan	yeah

2015-07-10 17:45:38	Pidgey	me tbh
2015-07-10 17:46:16	@PikFan	>tbh
2015-07-10 17:46:19	@PikFan	why tbh?
2015-07-10 17:46:28	@PikFan	you say it as if it's a bad thing
2015-07-10 17:46:32	Pidgey	because tbh (to be honest)
2015-07-10 17:46:47	Pidgey	idk it's a thing I just say
2015-07-10 17:46:54	@PikFan	I see
2015-07-10 17:47:06	@PikFan	sorry, it just struck me in an odd way :P
2015-07-10 17:47:10	Pidgey	it's fine
2015-07-10 17:47:14	@PikFan	and my tiredness doesn't help
2015-07-10 17:47:17	Pidgey	I understand how it felt out of place
2015-07-10 17:47:49	@PikFan	anyway, noted
2015-07-10 17:49:14	@PikFan	back to the original subject: I'm interested in the strange regions they've spotted
2015-07-10 17:49:29	Pidgey	oh?
2015-07-10 17:49:53	@PikFan	you haven't heard about those regions?
2015-07-10 17:50:17	Pidgey	no, my astronomy side has been slacking recently
2015-07-10 17:50:23	@PikFan	I see
2015-07-10 17:50:40	@PikFan	well, they've seen a bright area that looks like a heart
2015-07-10 17:50:52	Pidgey	hmm, odd shape
2015-07-10 17:51:04	@PikFan	then there's a darker area to the lower left of it which they call a whale
2015-07-10 17:51:05	Pidgey	wait, what heart-shape are we talking about?
2015-07-10 17:51:10	Pidgey	the real one, or the fake one?
2015-07-10 17:51:12	@PikFan	♥
2015-07-10 17:51:14	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-10 17:51:15	Pidgey	okay
2015-07-10 17:51:15	Yoshi2_	coincidences happen
2015-07-10 17:51:17	Pidgey	the fake one

2015-07-10 17:51:59	Pidgey	ooh, neat!
2015-07-10 17:52:25	@PikFan	and then there's a smaller area on the other side that they call a "donut"
2015-07-10 17:52:55	@PikFan	http://i2.wp.com/www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nh-pluto-color-7-6-2015_0.png
2015-07-10 17:53:05	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-10 17:53:07	Pidgey	neat!
2015-07-10 17:53:26	@PikFan	there's three other circular things near the donut, which makes me think these are craters
2015-07-10 17:53:36	@PikFan	as for the heart and the whale, I've no idea
2015-07-10 17:54:08	@PikFan	some weird differentiation in the ices? too early to tell
2015-07-10 17:54:21	Pidgey	the whale?
2015-07-10 17:54:50	@PikFan	09:51	PikFan	then there's a darker area to the lower left of it which they call a whale
2015-07-10 17:54:55	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-10 17:55:14	Pidgey	now I can see it
2015-07-10 17:56:38	@PikFan	woah
2015-07-10 17:57:03	Pidgey	?
2015-07-10 17:57:16	@PikFan	at its closest approach, New Horizons will take pictures of Pluto with staggering resolution 
2015-07-10 17:57:30	@PikFan	something like this http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/559f0ccaeab8ea8e5e014807-1200-706/nh-stern_8.jpg

2015-07-10 19:29:27	@PikFan	Yoshi2 why do you say hi to Testyo
2015-07-10 19:29:28	Testyo	Ah, I still need to test that
2015-07-10 19:29:33	@PikFan	:\
2015-07-10 19:29:56	@PikFan	Testyo is not deserving of greetings
2015-07-10 19:29:56	Testyo	why would it be linking to the chances of TWO people doing it?
2015-07-10 19:30:38	Yoshi2_	because bots deserve to be treated as equals

2015-07-10 19:31:04	@PikFan	or anything, really
2015-07-10 19:32:48	Yoshi2_	doesn't mean you shouldn't treat them well

2015-07-10 19:32:54	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2015-07-10 19:33:39	Yoshi2	also, it gives me an excuse to mention testyo's name so he says something potentially hilarious
2015-07-10 19:33:39	Testyo	luckily HexChat = too cumbersome
2015-07-10 19:33:55	Yoshi2	WHAT
2015-07-10 19:34:00	@PikFan	case in point
2015-07-10 19:34:19	@PikFan	because now hilarious = offensive!

2015-07-10 19:40:22	@Espyo	I know Testyo's line is from Dustforce
2015-07-10 19:40:23	Testyo	oops yep
2015-07-10 19:40:29	@Espyo	but it could be from a LOT of games
2015-07-10 19:40:31	@Espyo	that has to be a trope

2015-07-10 19:54:05	@PikFan	also, if I don't make sense, it's because I am extremely tired because I've stayed up nearly 23 hours straight
2015-07-10 19:54:11	@PikFan	just warning you
2015-07-10 19:56:00	@Espyo	good grief
2015-07-10 19:56:04	@Espyo	how does your body even work
2015-07-10 19:56:11	@PikFan	it defies logic
2015-07-10 19:56:23	@Espyo	sure looks like it
2015-07-10 19:56:43	@PikFan	but if you think that's insane, listen to this:
2015-07-10 19:56:56	@PikFan	09:39	Pidgey	My personal record is around 39 hours, I believe.
2015-07-10 19:56:58	@PikFan	09:39	Pidgey	Then I slept for eight hours, and everything was suddenly okay.
2015-07-10 19:57:09	@Espyo	wut
2015-07-10 19:57:19	@PikFan	pretty much
2015-07-10 19:57:21	@Espyo	am I in #guinessworldrecords instead?
2015-07-10 19:57:49	Yoshi2	Espyo: but you haven't heard the best part yet
2015-07-10 19:58:01	@PikFan	best part...?
2015-07-10 19:58:05	@PikFan	what best part
2015-07-10 19:58:15	Yoshi2	the reason PikFan is doing this is not because he has to do it, but because he wants to, as a challenge
2015-07-10 19:58:28	Pidgey	Isn't that why everyone does it, though, Yoshi2?
2015-07-10 19:58:53	@PikFan	my mom involuntarily stayed up 3 days while in labor
2015-07-10 19:58:55	@PikFan	so no
2015-07-10 19:59:12	@PikFan	er wait
2015-07-10 19:59:17	@PikFan	...not in labor
2015-07-10 19:59:17	Yoshi2	Pidgey: not really, no
2015-07-10 19:59:20	@PikFan	after birth
2015-07-10 19:59:32	@PikFan	er, after MY birth, that is
2015-07-10 19:59:36	@PikFan	...you get the point
2015-07-10 19:59:43	@PikFan	uh, anyway
2015-07-10 20:00:00	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-10 20:00:43	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2015-07-10 20:00:48	@Espyo	mhm?
2015-07-10 20:00:49	Yoshi2	whenever I hear somebody stay up for so long, it's because they want to fix their sleeping schedule like that, or because they need to finish a paper that is due next day
2015-07-10 20:01:10	@PikFan	adding |nocat=y adds an empty line between the template and the text

2015-07-10 20:13:58	@PikFan	Espyo you forgot to update the anonnotice

2015-07-10 20:14:57	@Espyo	well, done
2015-07-10 20:15:09	@Espyo	we should probably put a tutorial somewhere
2015-07-10 20:15:28	@Espyo	you have to change it, AND change the anonnotice, AND change the sitenotice id
2015-07-10 20:17:22	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-07-10 20:17:35	@PikFan	oh, there's something that I could do
2015-07-10 20:17:43	@PikFan	I could grab all the obstacle locations
2015-07-10 20:17:49	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/MediaWiki_talk:Sitenotice#To_update and done
2015-07-10 20:18:38	@PikFan	what's the purpose of this anyway? http://www.pikminwiki.com/MediaWiki:Sitenotice_id
2015-07-10 20:19:08	@PikFan	does keeping track of the sitenotice changes actually do something?
2015-07-10 20:19:37	@Espyo	I think it forces clients to fetch the most updated version instead of using the cache
2015-07-10 20:19:43	@Espyo	clients go check that number
2015-07-10 20:19:52	@Espyo	if it's the same as the one they have in cache, then they just assume the notice didn't change
2015-07-10 20:19:55	@Espyo	and use the cache one
2015-07-10 20:20:05	@PikFan	ah
2015-07-10 20:20:17	@PikFan	caches can be really unreliable sometimes
2015-07-10 20:20:29	@Espyo	it's a necessary evil
2015-07-10 20:20:39	@Espyo	ah caches...
2015-07-10 20:20:48	@PikFan	especially for [[Special:WhosOnline]]
2015-07-10 20:20:48	Testyo	"Special:WhosOnline" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:WhosOnline
2015-07-10 20:20:55	@Espyo	on the engine, instead of the game drawing every bit of geometry in the terrain every single frame
2015-07-10 20:21:05	@Espyo	it just draws the terrain onto images once, and then uses the static images
2015-07-10 20:21:08	@Espyo	it's a lot faster
2015-07-10 20:21:18	@Espyo	...but that means the terrain has to be static (unless I hack around it)
2015-07-10 20:21:27	@Espyo	and more importantly, it could uncover bugs because stuff isn't updated right
2015-07-10 20:21:34	@Espyo	like my classic month-old bug
2015-07-10 20:21:37	@Espyo	fun times
2015-07-10 20:22:05	@PikFan	by terrain changes, do you mean like obstacles being cleared, etc?
2015-07-10 20:22:45	@Espyo	almost
2015-07-10 20:22:55	@Espyo	but mostly, yes
2015-07-10 20:23:00	@Espyo	well, gates are just an object
2015-07-10 20:23:03	@Espyo	they're just the object's graphic
2015-07-10 20:23:09	@Espyo	and when you clear them, only the gate really disappears
2015-07-10 20:23:24	@Espyo	but for like bridges, that'll have to be a combination of parts of the terrain
2015-07-10 20:23:41	@Espyo	and I'll have to draw the original terrain sans bridge, and then draw bridge terrain on top of it
2015-07-10 20:23:47	@Espyo	the purpose of the cache is to avoid drawing stuff in real time
2015-07-10 20:23:51	@Espyo	but it's just one bridge, no worries
2015-07-10 20:24:10	@Espyo	comparing the bridge's 1-5~ sectors to the area's total of 500+ sectors...
2015-07-10 20:24:15	@PikFan	what if people go insane and make a level based on bridges
2015-07-10 20:24:52	@Espyo	then let's hope they're not insane enough to wonder why their level is so slow
2015-07-10 20:26:01	@PikFan	also, are P1+2-style bridges easier on the engine than P3-style bridges?
2015-07-10 20:26:35	@PikFan	since you don't have to carry fragments for a wooden bridge as opposed to a ceramic bridge?
2015-07-10 20:28:01	@Espyo	a LOT
2015-07-10 20:28:12	@Espyo	just one "enemy"-like object that the Pikmin hit
2015-07-10 20:28:14	@Espyo	it drops its HP
2015-07-10 20:28:17	@Espyo	when its HP reaches 0
2015-07-10 20:28:20	@Espyo	boom, new sector
2015-07-10 20:28:21	@Espyo	done
2015-07-10 20:28:40	@Espyo	for P3, I'd have to implement a "pile" object that has the number of pieces in it
2015-07-10 20:28:49	@Espyo	to keep it simple, if I make it, I won't make its graphics change
2015-07-10 20:28:59	@Espyo	or at least have two stages: full and half-full
2015-07-10 20:29:07	@Espyo	anyway, the Pikmin will have to carry it... which shouldn't be TOO hard
2015-07-10 20:29:14	@Espyo	and deliver it to the bridge, which again, shouldn't be all that hard
2015-07-10 20:29:21	@Espyo	updating the bridge's graphics is gonna be cumbersome
2015-07-10 20:29:29	@Espyo	because if you take one shard from a pile, the pile looks the same
2015-07-10 20:29:37	@Espyo	but if you add one shard to any bridge, the bridge looks different
2015-07-10 20:29:40	@Espyo	specially from a top-down view
2015-07-10 20:29:47	@PikFan	just shrink the pile a tiny bit
2015-07-10 20:29:52	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-10 20:29:57	@Espyo	but the problem is the bridge
2015-07-10 20:30:02	@Espyo	I could just make it ugly and have 3 graphics for the bridge
2015-07-10 20:30:14	@Espyo	 0 - 33%, where the bridge is only like 3 shards big
2015-07-10 20:30:22	@Espyo	 33 - 66%, where it has a bit
2015-07-10 20:30:35	@Espyo	 66% to 100% where it's almost done
2015-07-10 20:30:40	@Espyo	and block passageway until the bridge is all done
2015-07-10 20:30:53	@Espyo	well, it shouldn't be hard, but it'll certainly be harder than P1/2 bridges
2015-07-10 20:31:25	@PikFan	mm
2015-07-10 20:32:12	@PikFan	oh, so yesterday I realized that I was making my areas too linear
2015-07-10 20:32:23	@PikFan	well, they ARE too linear
2015-07-10 20:32:48	@PikFan	because in the canon games the landing site is usually near the middle of the map
2015-07-10 20:32:59	@PikFan	in my game, the landing site is near the edge
2015-07-10 20:33:06	@PikFan	not really good exploration wise
2015-07-10 20:33:14	@PikFan	and it ends up being linear
2015-07-10 20:33:21	@PikFan	which I don't want
2015-07-10 20:33:49	@Espyo	yeah, not very good
2015-07-10 20:33:54	@PikFan	yes, there is at least one path you have to take to advance the story
2015-07-10 20:34:00	@PikFan	but you have to have other paths, too
2015-07-10 20:34:02	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-10 20:34:16	@PikFan	like when you go back to the Tropical Wilds
2015-07-10 20:34:29	@PikFan	when you throw the leaders across that bridge, already you've got three ways to go
2015-07-10 20:34:50	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-10 20:34:53	@PikFan	and even then, right at the onion itself, you can go back into that cave
2015-07-10 20:35:05	@PikFan	or go attack that bulborb
2015-07-10 20:35:18	@PikFan	anyway, I need to update my areas so they have more paths
2015-07-10 20:35:48	@Espyo	yes
2015-07-10 20:35:55	@Espyo	remember, paths aren't the only way to delete linearity
2015-07-10 20:36:12	@Espyo	a large open room with several platforms provides several things to do
2015-07-10 20:36:14	@Espyo	without using paths
2015-07-10 20:36:34	@PikFan	by path, I don't mean an actual pathway
2015-07-10 20:36:56	@PikFan	just the route to get somewhere
2015-07-10 20:37:12	@Espyo	...so a pathway
2015-07-10 20:37:32	@PikFan	ugh
2015-07-10 20:37:44	@PikFan	I meant not physically defined
2015-07-10 20:37:45	@Espyo	try using "corridor" in your explanation
2015-07-10 20:37:52	@Espyo	probably a word you want
2015-07-10 20:37:53	@PikFan	noted
2015-07-10 20:38:45	@PikFan	but yeah, not strictly a corridor, but just a way
2015-07-10 20:39:19	@Espyo	hm, okay
2015-07-10 20:39:48	@PikFan	[[f:Distant Desert]]

2015-07-10 20:40:03	@PikFan	if you look at that, you'll see it's pretty much one giant line

2015-07-10 20:41:29	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-07-10 20:42:52	@PikFan	speaking of my game, I mentioned objects in the main article
2015-07-10 20:43:15	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds#Objects
2015-07-10 20:43:30	@PikFan	I don't know why I never mentioned that before
2015-07-10 20:44:35	@PikFan	I ought to change this to Achievements or something http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds#Flowers
2015-07-10 20:45:30	@PikFan	I blame my immature 12 year old self who made it as a blatant rip off of NSMBW's stars
2015-07-10 20:45:31	@PikFan	._.
2015-07-10 20:46:09	Yoshi2	wait until you start blaming your immature 15 year old self in another 3 years
2015-07-10 20:46:17	@PikFan	ikr
2015-07-10 20:46:40	@PikFan	I wonder what amazing inconsistencies I'll find then
2015-07-10 20:46:55	@PikFan	if nobody's found them yet
2015-07-10 20:47:15	Yoshi2	I'm still blaming my younger self from 1 year ago for the stuff I did in my code

2015-07-10 21:30:31	Pidgey	and I still beat myself up from things I did when I was at an immature age of 17
2015-07-10 21:33:35	Yoshi2	I'm starting to see a pattern
2015-07-10 21:34:00	Yoshi2	what if we beat ourself up for things we did in the distant past?
2015-07-10 21:34:42	@Espyo	distant?
2015-07-10 21:34:52	@Espyo	I sometimes beat 2-hour-ago Espyo for something stupid in the code
2015-07-10 21:35:11	@Espyo	https://xkcd.com/221/ good to know this is how windows' batch scripting works
2015-07-10 21:35:31	@Espyo	there's a... uh, convoluted, to say the ABSOLUTE least
2015-07-10 21:35:35	@Espyo	to get a random file in a folder
2015-07-10 21:35:39	@Espyo	...it's a random pick, sure
2015-07-10 21:35:43	@Espyo	but it's ALWAYS the same pick
2015-07-10 21:35:47	@Espyo	no matter how many times you run the script
2015-07-10 21:39:08	@Espyo	actually, I'm reading that it depends on the system clock
2015-07-10 21:39:10	@Espyo	and uses the second
2015-07-10 21:39:18	@Espyo	...but for me, it looks more like it uses the minutes
2015-07-10 21:39:19	@Espyo	ugh
2015-07-10 21:39:29	@Espyo	good thing I knew hours in advance what I'd be getting in to
2015-07-10 21:39:34	@Espyo	*into
2015-07-10 21:42:15	Yoshi2	Espyo: there is a way to get a random file in batch?
2015-07-10 21:42:29	@Espyo	convoluted, yeah
2015-07-10 21:42:48	@Espyo	set n=0
2015-07-10 21:42:48	@Espyo	for %%f in (*.jpg) do (
2015-07-10 21:42:49	@Espyo	   set /A n+=1
2015-07-10 21:42:49	@Espyo	   set "file[!n!]=%%f"
2015-07-10 21:42:49	@Espyo	)
2015-07-10 21:42:49	@Espyo	set /A "rand=(n*%random%)/32768+1"
2015-07-10 21:42:50	Testyo	Espyo is a flooder!
2015-07-10 21:42:51	@Espyo	"!file[%rand%]!"
2015-07-10 21:42:53	@Espyo	ultra-intuitive, right?
2015-07-10 21:43:41	Pidgey	sure, anyone could understand that
2015-07-10 21:44:44	@Espyo	yyyyyep
2015-07-10 21:45:39	Yoshi2	different question: why would you need to choose a random file?
2015-07-10 21:46:48	@Espyo	just something I want to do
2015-07-10 21:47:06	Yoshi2	fair enough
2015-07-10 21:47:20	@Espyo	so I'm trying PowerShell
2015-07-10 21:47:27	Yoshi2	in that case, yeah, it's silly
2015-07-10 21:47:27	@Espyo	people say that you should use that unless you're a masochist
2015-07-10 21:47:58	@Espyo	it's slow... but I think it's only slow because an antimalware process from windows is running in the background, taking up 30%+
2015-07-10 21:48:00	@Espyo	*CPU usage
2015-07-10 21:48:05	@Espyo	anyway, I open task manager
2015-07-10 21:48:11	@Espyo	and on the list of processes
2015-07-10 21:48:15	@Espyo	it says task manager isn't responding
2015-07-10 21:48:27	@Espyo	even though I'm clicking on its menus, scrolling its bars, and it's fine
2015-07-10 21:48:37	@Espyo	I'm telling you, not a single day goes by without windows making me facepalm

2015-07-10 21:58:23	@J	unixy command-line scripting has weird stuff anyway
2015-07-10 21:58:40	En_Passant	That's what I thought. I don't know what you mean by poor excuse of/best possible one, then.
2015-07-10 21:58:42	@J	like, I recently learned that xargs does weird unescaping on lines it reads
2015-07-10 21:58:56	@J	you have to shell-escape the lines individually for it to work in a sensible way, or something
2015-07-10 21:59:16	@J	also $() in Bash trims your trailing whitespace for no apparenty reason
2015-07-10 21:59:27	@J	*apparent
2015-07-10 22:00:07	@Espyo	it relates to what I was saying before En_Passant
2015-07-10 22:00:11	@Espyo	err, complex stuff
2015-07-10 22:00:27	@Espyo	hm, that is kinda weird
2015-07-10 22:00:39	@Espyo	still, anything that isn't windows' default bash is a relief for me

2015-07-11 15:18:14	Yoshi2	ah
2015-07-11 15:18:26	Yoshi2	we discussed that not too long ago
2015-07-11 15:19:15	Yoshi2	I had plans to ask that person about that, but it requires me creating an account on the forum

2015-07-11 16:16:57	@Espyo	apparently he made an editor for Metroid Prime 2 levels

2015-07-11 16:29:42	Yoshi2_	a level editor oOo
2015-07-11 16:30:12	Yoshi2_	it's difficult enough to read and write the file formats from a game

2015-07-11 16:32:02	Yoshi2_	I really feel some people know far more about the games than the information that is available on the internet
2015-07-11 16:32:08	Pidgey	this reminds me of Super Mario World hacking
2015-07-11 16:32:26	Pidgey	you can apparently make Super Mario World into an RPG if you use Lunar Magic efficiently
2015-07-11 16:32:42	@Espyo	holy
2015-07-11 16:32:42	Pidgey	there are even Super Mario World hacks that combine generes
2015-07-11 16:32:50	Pidgey	so in short
2015-07-11 16:33:00	Pidgey	you can make almost anything with Super Mario World
2015-07-11 16:33:22	@Espyo	well, TASers did manage to turn it into Snake
2015-07-11 16:33:25	Yoshi2_	there are assembly wizzards who can do crazy stuff with SMW

2015-07-11 16:37:12	Pidgey	ah
2015-07-11 16:37:28	Pidgey	I watched the thing whilst it was streaming
2015-07-11 16:38:05	Pidgey	Miles' Metroid Prime run kind of disappointed me because I couldn't watch it at 8x speed.

2015-07-13 19:05:12	@PikFan	so I added an extra thing to {{f:PCW}}

2015-07-13 19:05:36	@PikFan	it can make a category for enemies now
2015-07-13 19:05:56	@PikFan	problem is, you also have to put in |nocat=y for it to work
2015-07-13 19:06:08	@PikFan	otherwise, it'll have two categories, and I don't want that
2015-07-13 19:06:09	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2015-07-13 19:06:54	@PikFan	this is what I added: {{#if:{{{enemies|}}}|[[Category:Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds Enemies]]|}}

2015-07-13 19:07:52	@PikFan	because if I don't have it, then Category:PCW appears along with Category:PCWEnemies
2015-07-13 19:08:06	@PikFan	and I only want Category:PCWEnemies
2015-07-13 19:09:18	@Espyo	the purpose of nocat is to not categorize anything

2015-07-13 19:13:13	@PikFan	well, I'm not sure what's wrong then

2015-07-13 19:31:25	Pidgey	why was it so sudden
2015-07-13 19:31:30	Pidgey	I don't understand
2015-07-13 19:32:03	@PikFan	I guess the tumor killed him
2015-07-13 19:32:12	Pidgey	mhm
2015-07-13 19:32:30	Pidgey	apparently the type of cancer he had only had a 30% survival rate
2015-07-13 19:32:37	Pidgey	and that's after the first five years
2015-07-13 19:33:06	@PikFan	who's going to take over...?
2015-07-13 19:33:43	@PikFan	as cool as it'd be for Miyamoto to be president, I feel like that he should focus only on making games
2015-07-13 19:34:59	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-07-13 19:35:47	@PikFan	I hope that whoever takes over will make the NX do really good
2015-07-13 19:38:23	Yoshi2	according to an official document, Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda are currently the representative directors

2015-07-13 23:01:30	@J	hmm, okay, looks like my ISP is doing a trial of phone + fibre which they don't actually have available publically yet
2015-07-13 23:01:49	@J	and somehow during the trial period it'll be the same cost as my current broadband
2015-07-13 23:01:53	@Espyo	...then how are they testing it?
2015-07-13 23:02:02	@Espyo	oh
2015-07-13 23:02:07	@Espyo	sheesh that's a harsh deal
2015-07-13 23:02:10	@J	I mean, they're offering it to me now, since I contacted them to ask about stuff
2015-07-13 23:02:17	@J	harsh?
2015-07-13 23:02:18	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2015-07-13 23:02:23	@J	upgrade to fibre for no increased cost?
2015-07-13 23:02:39	@Espyo	the way you worded it
2015-07-13 23:02:46	@Espyo	sounded more like you're being overcharged for a beta

2015-07-13 23:03:24	@Espyo	well, good then
2015-07-13 23:03:25	@J	well, I should ask how long the trial lasts, but it seems worth it
2015-07-13 23:03:41	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-13 23:06:10	@J	also it's unmetered, unlike any of the current packages they offer
2015-07-13 23:07:05	@J	though metering only applies 8am-8pm weekdays, so it wouldn't really be an issue
2015-07-13 23:07:24	@Espyo	hmmm

2015-07-14 20:03:44	Yoshi2	good day
2015-07-14 20:04:11	@PikFan	so, did you guys hear that New Horizons flew by Pluto?
2015-07-14 20:05:01	Yoshi2	I've heard around 6 hours ago that it would fly by Pluto in around 5 hours
2015-07-14 20:05:28	@PikFan	it flew by Pluto over 7 hours ago
2015-07-14 20:05:39	Yoshi2	huh
2015-07-14 20:06:02	Yoshi2	so maybe the article I read was already 5 hours old when I read it
2015-07-14 20:06:17	@PikFan	now they're waiting for the "phone home"
2015-07-14 20:06:28	@PikFan	which will take place at around 8:30 EDT
2015-07-14 20:06:37	@PikFan	...8:30 EDT
2015-07-14 20:06:46	@PikFan	8:30 EST?

2015-07-14 20:07:20	@PikFan	well, there's other time converters
2015-07-14 20:07:54	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-14 20:07:56	@Espyo	I've heard
2015-07-14 20:08:02	@Espyo	but I'm actually really not interested at all
2015-07-14 20:08:05	@Espyo	*shrug*
2015-07-14 20:09:02	@PikFan	aw, c'mon
2015-07-14 20:09:11	@PikFan	it's freaking PLUTO
2015-07-14 20:09:27	@PikFan	we've never seen it before
2015-07-14 20:09:38	@Espyo	we can actually SEE it?
2015-07-14 20:09:45	@PikFan	yes :|
2015-07-14 20:09:51	Yoshi2	we've never seen it before?
2015-07-14 20:10:13	Yoshi2	that's a bit suprising, is it so far away?
2015-07-14 20:10:17	@PikFan	there was a picture taken with Hubble, but it was so... blobby
2015-07-14 20:10:29	@PikFan	but now we have pretty good pictures

2015-07-14 20:13:12	@Espyo	what in the world
2015-07-14 20:13:17	@Espyo	today I learned
2015-07-14 20:13:19	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICkWjdQuK7Q of this song
2015-07-14 20:13:37	@Espyo	we have a song in Portuguese that's the exact same, and the chorus is an exact translation
2015-07-14 20:13:43	@Espyo	I thought the song was exclusively ours
2015-07-14 20:13:48	@Espyo	because our lyrics aren't forced or anything
2015-07-14 20:13:52	@Espyo	and then suddenly I hear this
2015-07-14 20:14:11	@Espyo	the actual tone of the song is different; ours is more like a girl on the beach making other bikini girls jealous
2015-07-14 20:14:20	@Espyo	but damn, this shook the life out of me
2015-07-14 20:15:00	@PikFan	what's the song in Portuguese?
2015-07-14 20:15:31	@Espyo	well, pretty much what I described
2015-07-14 20:15:36	@Espyo	unless you want a transcription you can't understand
2015-07-14 20:17:47	@PikFan	should've asked a different question
2015-07-14 20:17:58	@PikFan	is there a video of the Portuguese song?
2015-07-14 20:19:15	Yoshi2	for some odd reason, I want to wear a yellow polka dot bikini now
2015-07-14 20:19:20	Yoshi2	that song is way too catchy
2015-07-14 20:20:43	@Espyo	hm, there might be, one sec
2015-07-14 20:20:57	@Espyo	no song videoclip, probably just the song sung in a video
2015-07-14 20:21:46	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjdbjHQVLOI there's this
2015-07-14 20:21:57	@Espyo	the video itself is...
2015-07-14 20:22:00	@Espyo	magically bad
2015-07-14 20:22:03	@Espyo	I never saw something so poor
2015-07-14 20:22:07	@Espyo	but the song is intact

2015-07-14 20:43:24	Yoshi2	well, also
2015-07-14 20:43:27	Shard1	I just can't find the mini-boss or any more keys
2015-07-14 20:43:42	@Espyo	I think somebody asked for advice some days ago too
2015-07-14 20:43:43	Yoshi2	before changing water levels, see that you have checked everything you can do on the current level
2015-07-14 20:43:47	@Espyo	I said that the temple isn't that hard
2015-07-14 20:43:53	@Espyo	people just don't pay attention and are too impatient
2015-07-14 20:44:01	@PikFan	it was me
2015-07-14 20:44:01	Yoshi2	yup
2015-07-14 20:44:07	Yoshi2	the temple wasn't THAT bad
2015-07-14 20:44:13	@Espyo	right
2015-07-14 20:44:23	Shard1	I did check all of the levels, but I'll double check now.
2015-07-14 20:45:10	@Espyo	it's been far too long for me, so I can't remember any advice
2015-07-14 20:45:11	@Espyo	sorry
2015-07-14 20:45:27	Yoshi2	I think the mini boss is somewhere on the middle or top level
2015-07-14 20:45:58	@PikFan	21:43:46: <Espyo> if you look at the water temple with a "aaagggh this isn't streamlined, screw you Nintendo" outlook
2015-07-14 20:46:00	@PikFan	21:44:09: <Espyo> if you face the Water Temple as a temple you need to pay attention and explore in, it's pretty standard
2015-07-14 20:46:08	@Espyo	yeah, that
2015-07-14 20:46:23	@PikFan	oh, missed a part
2015-07-14 20:46:27	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-07-14 20:46:36	Yoshi2	when the water level is high, check the bottom of the tower, it might contain a key or so
2015-07-14 20:46:37	Shard1	Actually, that's true. The water temple isn't that hard, you just need to payattention
2015-07-14 20:51:43	Shard1	I can't get past that one room where there's all the water currents
