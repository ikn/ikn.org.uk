2016-01-27 03:07:36	Scruffy	...but the other is next to where Louie landed yesterday!
2016-01-27 03:07:46	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-01-27 03:07:49	Scruffy	And of course there are going to be enemies in the way
2016-01-27 03:07:55	Neocraftz1553	in the VoP
2016-01-27 03:08:09	Neocraftz1553	it is sounding awsome
2016-01-27 03:08:14	Scruffy	Oh, and I made sure that these only spawn Day 2 and onward
2016-01-27 03:08:34	Scruffy	So the question is, which enemies should appear where the Red Onion was yesterday?
2016-01-27 03:08:42	Scruffy	I was thinking Anode Beetles and a Mamuta
2016-01-27 03:08:49	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-27 03:09:07	Neocraftz1553	but Anode beetles = insta death
2016-01-27 03:09:26	Neocraftz1553	sooo, instead of a mamuta
2016-01-27 03:09:40	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-27 03:09:47	Neocraftz1553	actually, that soinds cool
2016-01-27 03:10:50	Scruffy	6 Anode Beetles
2016-01-27 03:11:55	Neocraftz1553	sounds cool
2016-01-27 03:12:23	Neocraftz1553	yesh
2016-01-27 03:13:07	Neocraftz1553	this might sound like a minor thing, but I made a spotcap big enough to conceal an item inside
2016-01-27 03:13:21	Neocraftz1553	so when you destroy the spotcap, the item coms out
2016-01-27 03:13:52	Neocraftz1553	brb im hungry
2016-01-27 03:23:45	Neocraftz1553	I am back

2016-01-27 19:49:22	Yoshi2	wat
2016-01-27 19:50:06	@Espyo	there are probably dozens of fangames called "Pikmin 4"
2016-01-27 19:51:16	Scruffy	Yeah, someone made it before P3 came out
2016-01-27 19:51:19	Scruffy	I think
2016-01-27 19:51:41	@Espyo	oh yeah, I remember that, actually
2016-01-27 19:52:51	Yoshi2	it specifically says Pikmin 4 (Wii U) though
2016-01-27 19:53:40	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-27 19:55:32	Scruffy	well actually, all the information on its page makes it seem like it came after Pikmin 3, until you get to the story and gameplay and things

2016-01-27 23:27:11	Neocraftz1553	yeah, true
2016-01-27 23:27:22	@Espyo	but even if I weren't single, I don't like the idea of a day dedicated to loving my significant other
2016-01-27 23:27:28	@Espyo	if I'm not loving her every day of my life, something's wrong
2016-01-27 23:27:38	@Espyo	having to put extra effort for a day as if that day means I love her more is kinda iffy
2016-01-27 23:27:38	Neocraftz1553	it is just another day on the calender to me :|
2016-01-27 23:27:47	@Espyo	but I guess that's how all "celebrate a person" type of holidays are

2016-01-28 20:56:18	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-01-28 20:56:25	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-28 20:56:52	Yoshi2	hi Scruffy 
2016-01-28 21:00:57	En_Passant	o/
2016-01-28 21:01:04	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-01-28 21:05:06	@Espyo	right, we need to come up with a place to gather all known information about Pikmin 2's files
2016-01-28 21:05:07	@Espyo	any ideas?
2016-01-28 21:05:55	En_Passant	A GitHub?
2016-01-28 21:05:59	En_Passant	Paste the code and add comments?
2016-01-28 21:06:00	Scruffy	A Google Doc?
2016-01-28 21:06:12	En_Passant	or that
2016-01-28 21:06:13	Scruffy	Oh, that's probably a better idea
2016-01-28 21:06:14	@Espyo	not sure if github would be the way to go
2016-01-28 21:06:20	@Espyo	I did think about Google Docs
2016-01-28 21:06:23	@Espyo	but what type of document?
2016-01-28 21:06:29	@Espyo	one 300 page "Word" document?
2016-01-28 21:06:35	@Espyo	a 300-tab "Excel" spreadsheet?
2016-01-28 21:06:38	Yoshi2	if you help me come up with a place to gather all known information about battalion wars, I will help you come up with a place for pikmin 2 files ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-01-28 21:06:50	@Espyo	we can just use the same :V
2016-01-28 21:06:53	@Espyo	the same solution
2016-01-28 21:06:55	@Espyo	not the same place
2016-01-28 21:07:05	 *	@Espyo shoos away BW info from his Pikmin info
2016-01-28 21:08:02	Yoshi2	I'd probably put my bw info into one or several document files in my github repo, but that's easier to do because I am the only person doing work on that
2016-01-28 21:08:18	Scruffy	No no we should put both in the same place
2016-01-28 21:08:18	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-28 21:08:25	Scruffy	If we combine the code we get a supergame
2016-01-28 21:08:27	@Espyo	iunno, I'd say Google Docs is the way to go
2016-01-28 21:08:30	@Espyo	Pikmin Wars?

2016-01-28 21:12:53	Testyo	I said so do you speak 3 languages well, or is it in-game because Neocraftz1553 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages so do you speak 3 languages well, or is it English? and all right, now try putting it in-game. They were joined by the common word it.
2016-01-28 21:13:48	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy, En_Passant, Espyo

2016-01-28 21:16:53	Yoshi2	I'm really not sure how the devs decided what textures/models to leave in BW
2016-01-28 21:17:13	Yoshi2	when I see stuff like this: https://i.imgur.com/PAzzgY7.png
2016-01-28 21:17:24	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure the devs are just being jerks to me
2016-01-28 21:17:27	@Espyo	pfft
2016-01-28 21:18:36	@Espyo	guess I'm a hacker now
2016-01-28 21:18:54	@Espyo	>Very interesting man, though seeing as you are a hacker, i expected Olimar to be at the very beginning with 100 Pikmin, discovering the red onion, that'd be pretty interesting, but this is just as awesome.﻿
2016-01-28 21:19:05	@Espyo	https://youtu.be/avId9eRrEUc (this video)
2016-01-28 21:20:45	Scruffy	I actually tried giving olimar 20 Pikmin at the beginning of Pikmin 2
2016-01-28 21:21:00	En_Passant	oh yeah
2016-01-28 21:21:01	Scruffy	So he deflated the paper bag before Louie found the Onion
2016-01-28 21:21:21	Scruffy	And I got the Courage Reactor without discovering the Onion
2016-01-28 21:21:47	Scruffy	Then the next day, the first thing that happened was the dialogue about making sure Louie was all right
2016-01-28 21:22:13	Scruffy	And then when he got next to the Onion the onion cutscene played (with Louie's bug eyes misplaced) and the Onion still ejected a new seed

2016-01-28 21:23:25	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-28 21:23:35	@Espyo	wow, I'd love to see Louie's eyes look even weirder
2016-01-28 21:24:20	En_Passant	You should see what happens if you go to the Onion as Olimar on Day 1
2016-01-28 21:24:50	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-28 21:24:58	Scruffy	Lemme try it out
2016-01-28 21:25:04	@Espyo	how so?
2016-01-28 21:25:09	@Espyo	you already can go to the Onion on day 1
2016-01-28 21:25:17	Scruffy	Oh, that's true
2016-01-28 21:25:36	Scruffy	You can't get to the Onion without the game thinking you've deflated the bag
2016-01-28 21:25:46	@Espyo	ih
2016-01-28 21:25:47	@Espyo	*oh
2016-01-28 21:25:48	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-28 21:25:53	@Espyo	though I WAS thinking of Pikmin 1
2016-01-28 21:25:53	Scruffy	Unless I changed the geometry of the area
2016-01-28 21:26:03	@Espyo	it sucks that there's no super jump code for Pikmin 2
2016-01-28 21:26:11	@Espyo	it would've come in handy before so, SO many times
2016-01-28 21:26:16	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-28 21:26:21	En_Passant	Does deflating the bag activate a trigger?
2016-01-28 21:26:26	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-28 21:26:32	Scruffy	Either bag, actually
2016-01-28 21:26:37	@Espyo	I wrote a code that does... /something/ to the height coordinate of Olimar's position
2016-01-28 21:26:43	Scruffy	It activates the scene where Louie and Olimar reunite
2016-01-28 21:26:44	@Espyo	I can activate it, and play Russian roulette
2016-01-28 21:26:54	@Espyo	either it puts me at a Z I can use, or I go under the ground and out of bounds
2016-01-28 21:27:57	En_Passant	But what if Louie hasn't done the Onion cutscenes yet?
2016-01-28 21:28:09	En_Passant	Does the game act differently if you go to the Onion as Olimar?
2016-01-28 21:28:25	@Espyo	well, some things would be different
2016-01-28 21:28:29	@Espyo	Louie is meant to go bug-eyed, right?
2016-01-28 21:28:34	@Espyo	at least his model would change
2016-01-28 21:28:38	@Espyo	but would it change Olimar's instead?
2016-01-28 21:28:48	Scruffy	No
2016-01-28 21:29:10	Scruffy	Since Louie and Olimar reunite, the game assumes that louie has found the onion, meaning Olimar can approach it no problem
2016-01-28 21:29:15	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-28 21:29:25	En_Passant	Well, sure, but it doesn't do that on Day 2
2016-01-28 21:29:26	Scruffy	Olimar can probably do whatever he wants to it since you can't access the onion on hte first day
2016-01-28 21:30:09	Scruffy	And if Louie approaches the Onion on Day 1, no matter when, the normal cutscene will play
2016-01-28 21:30:28	Scruffy	But if Louie /doesn't/, it'll play when he approaches the Onion on day 2
2016-01-28 21:30:45	En_Passant	oh
2016-01-28 21:33:15	Scruffy	Or, whenever he approaches the Red Onion
2016-01-28 21:33:34	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-01-28 21:40:24	En_Passant	gtg for now
2016-01-28 21:41:08	Scruffy	Oh, see ay
2016-01-28 21:42:22	Scruffy	I just tried discovering the Red Onion on Day 2 with 100 Pikmin
2016-01-28 21:42:29	Scruffy	Some weeeeeird stuff happene
2016-01-28 21:43:52	Scruffy	Firstly, the moment I landed the ship told me about the Pikmin still being in their Onion
2016-01-28 21:43:57	Scruffy	What lazy creatures~
2016-01-28 21:44:31	Scruffy	And then immediately after, as in no gameplay in between fade to black, the ship asks Louie if he's alright
2016-01-28 21:45:02	Scruffy	And Louie does not do his animation since he's misplaced, the camera isn't centered on him but is right in front of the ship
2016-01-28 21:45:16	Scruffy	Then once that's done, gameplay begins with Olimar under the Onion
2016-01-28 21:45:25	<--	En_Passant (Mibbit@64.62.vzx.put) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-01-28 21:45:28	Scruffy	And I immediately hear the "Pikmin number decreasing" Sound
2016-01-28 21:45:37	Scruffy	But I haven't lost any
2016-01-28 21:45:40	Scruffy	I still have all 100
2016-01-28 21:45:54	Scruffy	I take them out with Olimar and stand aside for Louie to discover the Onion
2016-01-28 21:46:16	Scruffy	His big eyes and eyebrows are misplaced the whole time, including when he's running away from the Red Pikmin
2016-01-28 21:46:46	Scruffy	And when the Onion first shoots out that sprout, the whole game goes black for an instant, probably not ready for the 100 pikmin in the field
2016-01-28 21:46:59	Scruffy	But once it's done I still have 100 Pikmin, 1 was put in the Onion
2016-01-28 21:47:30	Scruffy	And briefly I hear, of all things, the Pikmin 2 boss music! Before it fades back into VoR music
2016-01-28 21:53:02	@Espyo	WHAT
2016-01-28 21:53:06	@Espyo	that's mental
2016-01-28 21:58:35	Scruffy	I think I messed it up pretty bad
2016-01-28 21:58:41	Scruffy	But never more than 100 Pikmin
2016-01-28 21:58:51	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-28 22:09:07	@Espyo	ok, time for science
2016-01-28 22:09:14	@Espyo	gonna measure how long Pikmin take to carry various objects
2016-01-28 22:09:19	@Espyo	so I can try to find an equation
2016-01-28 22:11:07	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-01-28 22:16:09	@Espyo	...this won't be easy
2016-01-28 22:16:21	@Espyo	took 569 frames for them to carry the 10-pellet at the Valley of Repose to the blue Onion
2016-01-28 22:16:26	@Espyo	which is right next to the landing site
2016-01-28 22:16:29	@Espyo	I had to count each and every frame
2016-01-28 22:16:35	@Espyo	because for some reason Dolphin doesn't have a frame counter
2016-01-28 22:19:15	Scruffy	Ugh
2016-01-28 22:20:38	Testyo	*was what
2016-01-28 22:21:23	@Espyo	oh it's RIGHT THE HELL THERE
2016-01-28 22:21:24	@Espyo	I must be blind
2016-01-28 22:21:33	@Espyo	Movie/Show Frame Counter
2016-01-28 22:21:40	@Espyo	well, I could swear it wasn't there in previous versions :/
2016-01-28 22:21:48	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-28 22:46:21	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-28 22:46:31	@Espyo	 10 flowers took exactly as long as 20 leaves to carry the pellet
2016-01-28 22:46:38	@Espyo	well, one-frame difference
2016-01-28 22:48:39	Scruffy	Wow
2016-01-28 22:48:46	Scruffy	That's pretty cool
2016-01-28 22:48:55	Scruffy	wait a second
2016-01-28 22:49:08	@Espyo	which is also the same time 10 spicy leaves take!
2016-01-28 22:49:23	Scruffy	Wow!
2016-01-28 22:49:39	Scruffy	Well, spicies do have double speed
2016-01-28 22:49:43	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-28 22:49:51	Scruffy	Interestingly, this must be unrelated to just running speed
2016-01-28 22:49:58	@Espyo	well, x1.55 speed
2016-01-28 22:50:04	@Espyo	yeah, don't think it's related
2016-01-28 22:50:04	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-28 22:50:13	Scruffy	leaf speed 120
2016-01-28 22:50:15	Scruffy	flower 170
2016-01-28 22:50:19	Scruffy	for running
2016-01-28 22:50:23	@Espyo	uhm, where did you get these values from?
2016-01-28 22:50:54	Scruffy	pikiParms.txt
2016-01-28 22:51:03	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-01-28 22:51:06	Scruffy	In Abe's folder "piki"
2016-01-28 22:51:15	@Espyo	right, I remember you saying it, now
2016-01-28 22:51:24	@Espyo	no data for carrying speed outside of those weird parameters, then?
2016-01-28 22:51:30	@Espyo	by those weird parameters, I mean [[Carrying#Speeds]]
2016-01-28 22:51:31	Testyo	"Carrying#Speeds" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Carrying#Speeds
2016-01-28 22:51:33	@Espyo	the ones listed here
2016-01-28 22:53:52	Scruffy	Purple Pikmin also have a speed multiplier of 0.8
2016-01-28 22:53:58	Scruffy	But I don't know if that applies to carrying
2016-01-28 22:54:11	Scruffy	And White Pikmin 1.2
2016-01-28 22:54:32	Scruffy	Oh, wait
2016-01-28 22:54:33	Scruffy	{P020} 4 0.500000 # bud | transportation bonus
2016-01-28 22:54:39	Scruffy	{P021} 4 1.000000 # flower | transportation bonus
2016-01-28 22:54:45	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-28 22:54:49	Scruffy	buds carry exactly 50% faster
2016-01-28 22:54:52	Scruffy	And flower 100%
2016-01-28 22:55:02	@Espyo	but that can't be right
2016-01-28 22:55:13	@Espyo	 10 leaves take 786 frames, 10 flowers take 569
2016-01-28 22:55:17	@Espyo	that's not twice as fast

2016-01-28 22:56:43	Scruffy	I don't know what those are then
2016-01-28 22:56:55	Scruffy	Some day I just have to change all these to 10000 and see what happens
2016-01-28 22:57:17	Scruffy	There's even a value /on the Pikmin/ for how long it takes them to die by Jellyfloat
2016-01-28 22:58:37	@Espyo	...wow
2016-01-28 22:58:46	@Espyo	 20 blue spicy flowers took as long as 20 blue spicy LEAVES
2016-01-28 22:58:58	@Espyo	wow, that's dumb
2016-01-28 22:59:42	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-28 23:00:00	Scruffy	All Pikmin have 190 "doping" speed

2016-01-28 23:01:08	@Espyo	so yeah
2016-01-28 23:01:14	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-01-28 23:01:24	@Espyo	now, to test Purples
2016-01-28 23:05:20	@Espyo	wow, 2 Purples are barely any faster than 1
2016-01-28 23:05:26	@Espyo	 1066 vs 1164
2016-01-28 23:05:33	Scruffy	I can imagine
2016-01-28 23:05:33	@Espyo	oooh! that might be what those weird numbers mean!
2016-01-28 23:05:42	@Espyo	uhm, maybe
2016-01-28 23:05:44	@Espyo	hm, needs more science
2016-01-28 23:05:51	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-28 23:05:57	Scruffy	Well let's see
2016-01-28 23:06:02	Scruffy	1164*0.6
2016-01-28 23:06:07	Scruffy	Testyo?
2016-01-28 23:06:08	Testyo	yeah, I think there's probably a few days ago
2016-01-28 23:06:16	@Espyo	he can't
2016-01-28 23:06:18	@Espyo	not bright enough
2016-01-28 23:06:27	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-28 23:06:36	Scruffy	Well it's 698.4 any way
2016-01-28 23:06:40	Scruffy	So never mind
2016-01-28 23:10:55	@Espyo	 641 frames for 10 Purple flowers

2016-01-28 23:24:51	@Espyo	...thanks, RNG
2016-01-28 23:25:00	@Espyo	it's SO hard to get 20 Purples to start carrying the same thing at the same time
2016-01-28 23:25:02	@Espyo	and when I finally do
2016-01-28 23:25:06	@Espyo	the RNG picks either yellow or red
2016-01-28 23:27:25	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-28 23:29:23	@Espyo	ugh, everything is just awful about this
2016-01-28 23:29:31	@Espyo	the terrain where the pellet is on is kinda sloped
2016-01-28 23:29:45	@Espyo	the pellet is right next to the edge, so Pikmin fall off all the time, while trying to go to their spot
2016-01-28 23:30:08	@Espyo	and I'm pretty sure I configured a key to lower the sensitivity of the arrow keys, but it's not working
2016-01-28 23:33:00	Scruffy	Yeah, I've never been able to work with that either
2016-01-28 23:33:22	Scruffy	Sometimes I boot Dolphin and some of the keys don't even function
2016-01-28 23:35:25	@Espyo	that's weirder
2016-01-28 23:36:59	@Espyo	oh, I just had to go to the bathroom
2016-01-28 23:37:03	@Espyo	that was the answer to fixing the RNG
2016-01-28 23:37:11	@Espyo	got blue first try after returning
2016-01-28 23:37:39	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-28 23:37:55	Scruffy	They're Blue Pikmin, they didn't want you to think about running water
2016-01-28 23:41:53	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-28 23:59:43	Scruffy	gotta go
2016-01-28 23:59:57	Scruffy	good luck with your science
2016-01-28 23:59:58	@Espyo	same
2016-01-29 00:00:03	@Espyo	enough for today
2016-01-29 00:00:04	@Espyo	night
2016-01-29 00:00:11	Scruffy	Oh, right
2016-01-29 00:00:12	Scruffy	midnight for you
2016-01-29 00:00:15	Scruffy	Cool, have a good night!

2016-01-29 18:42:55	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-29 18:42:56	Testyo	we... can't replace it
2016-01-29 18:45:21	Scruffy	Hi Espyo
2016-01-29 18:49:07	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-29 18:54:32	Scruffy	I was messing with the SS Drake in Blender, and I found something interesting
2016-01-29 18:55:16	Scruffy	There appears to be one window that is different from the other 3; it's its own object
2016-01-29 18:55:34	Scruffy	And behind it is a simply modelled compartment /inside the Drake/
2016-01-29 18:56:09	Scruffy	Perhaps that's where you look in to see whichever leader is writing that day's journal?
2016-01-29 18:56:27	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-29 18:56:28	@Espyo	maybe, yeah
2016-01-29 18:56:33	@Espyo	wonder if you can see it in-game
2016-01-29 18:57:11	Scruffy	It's so well-modeled
2016-01-29 18:57:32	Scruffy	I remember looking at it in promotional pictures and thinking "That's awesome. That looks like a real spacecraft"
2016-01-29 19:04:14	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-01-29 19:37:21	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Unused_content_in_Pikmin_3&curid=19313&diff=159427&oldid=158980 this guy, honestly
2016-01-29 19:37:29	@Espyo	not only is he saying that I said something that I never did
2016-01-29 19:37:34	@Espyo	he's also asking for stuff that doesn't exist
2016-01-29 19:37:41	Scruffy	Blue Cannon Beetle?
2016-01-29 19:37:52	@Espyo	if you read the article or TCRF, you'll see how there are only PARAMETERS for a "blue" Armored Cannon Larva
2016-01-29 19:37:55	@Espyo	no textures or models
2016-01-29 19:38:15	@Espyo	I mean, if "Blue Cannon Beetle" is the "Lapis Lazuli" Armored Cannon Larva that never made it to the final game
2016-01-29 19:38:45	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-29 19:39:57	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Goolix&curid=410&diff=159381&oldid=159072 and this edit here...
2016-01-29 19:40:05	@Espyo	his changes don't really add anything
2016-01-29 19:40:14	@Espyo	[[throw]]n is the same as [[throw|thrown]], so he just made that bigger
2016-01-29 19:40:15	Testyo	"throw" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=throw
2016-01-29 19:40:20	@Espyo	and the todo was there for a reason
2016-01-29 19:40:33	@Espyo	I gave that section a read several months ago, and concluded that it had some stuff wrong
2016-01-29 19:40:57	@Espyo	>If more Pikmin attack the blue nucleus, the damage will go even higher.
2016-01-29 19:40:59	@Espyo	this, for one
2016-01-29 19:41:10	@Espyo	only one Pikmin can attack the large nucleus at a time, and that's by banging against it
2016-01-29 19:41:31	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-01-29 19:41:41	Scruffy	It's been a spell since I've fought the Goolix
2016-01-29 19:41:46	@Espyo	same here
2016-01-29 19:41:51	@Espyo	but I'm like 80% sure of what I'm saying
2016-01-29 19:42:04	@Espyo	oh, the blue nucleus is the small one
2016-01-29 19:42:50	Scruffy	Yeah, we should differentiate them by size, since it all looks blueish inside the Goolix
2016-01-29 19:43:18	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-29 19:43:26	@Espyo	so yeah, big cleanup needed
2016-01-29 19:43:31	@Espyo	I guess I'll boot up Dolphin...
2016-01-29 19:43:47	Scruffy	I keep imagining that in some Pikmin installment they'll reinclude the Goolix
2016-01-29 19:44:00	@Espyo	I was thinking about how easy it'd be to add the Goolix on the engine
2016-01-29 19:44:02	Scruffy	With their unfairly amazing water engine
2016-01-29 19:44:05	@Espyo	...not that hard, honestly
2016-01-29 19:44:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 19:44:17	Scruffy	But it has to stretch around...
2016-01-29 19:44:25	@Espyo	oh yeah, I didn't even think about how watery a Pikmin 3-like enemy would be like
2016-01-29 19:44:38	@Espyo	I hope they at least do something similar
2016-01-29 19:44:54	Scruffy	Actually, when I re-designed the Goolix in my own game, I made it act more like a giant cell
2016-01-29 19:45:05	Scruffy	That tries to wrap around and form a vesicle around Pikmin
2016-01-29 19:45:09	@Espyo	oh, neat
2016-01-29 19:45:21	Scruffy	But that would be so difficult to realize in programming
2016-01-29 19:45:24	@Espyo	the thing with the Goolix is that there are a lot of improvements like that that can be made
2016-01-29 19:45:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 19:45:32	@Espyo	...but in the end, it will never pose a threat to Blues
2016-01-29 19:45:42	@Espyo	I guess it could be aggressive for the leaders, though
2016-01-29 19:46:26	@Espyo	right, I guess we should start up a set of Google Docs with Pikmin 2 stuff
2016-01-29 19:46:47	@Espyo	I spent some minutes today translating PikiParams
2016-01-29 19:46:51	@Espyo	and finding so many juicy things
2016-01-29 19:46:58	@Espyo	halfway through I realized you probably already translated them too
2016-01-29 19:47:04	@Espyo	heck, probably other people did in the past as well
2016-01-29 19:47:12	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-29 19:47:22	Scruffy	Well at least now we'll have some organization to it
2016-01-29 19:47:28	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-29 19:47:36	@Espyo	right, I'm trying to find alternatives
2016-01-29 19:47:39	@Espyo	doesn't look like there's any
2016-01-29 19:47:45	@Espyo	guess it'll work, but contributors need a google account
2016-01-29 19:48:18	Scruffy	True
2016-01-29 19:48:23	Scruffy	Well at least I have one
2016-01-29 19:48:36	@Espyo	uhm, how do I create a public folder in this?
2016-01-29 19:48:50	@Espyo	I think I've got it
2016-01-29 19:48:59	@Espyo	google docs is kinda hefty on my machine
2016-01-29 19:49:07	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-29 19:49:49	Scruffy	Blender is *really* heavy on mine
2016-01-29 19:50:04	Scruffy	I'm rendering something for Pikminfan27 right now and I can't really do much else
2016-01-29 19:50:12	@Espyo	odd, I don't think Blender was ever heavy on my machines
2016-01-29 19:50:14	@Espyo	which makes no sense
2016-01-29 19:50:23	@Espyo	hm, then again, I guess I never did work on anything bigger than 8 vertexes :|
2016-01-29 19:50:28	@Espyo	oh, that sucks
2016-01-29 19:51:20	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-29 19:51:50	Scruffy	Well, it's smooth as pudding if you have some sort of external processor
2016-01-29 19:51:58	Scruffy	But I just have my poor little CPU
2016-01-29 19:52:02	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-01-29 19:53:47	@Espyo	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qf8bfy-ie0b2ppuARyyCg1UEUwA7xU9zXkJ8h5fIp4A/edit?usp=sharing
2016-01-29 19:54:27	@Espyo	guess we can start adding stuff, but...
2016-01-29 19:54:33	@Espyo	I'm thinking it'd be better if we had one document for each thing
2016-01-29 19:54:38	@Espyo	like, one document to list what each sound is
2016-01-29 19:54:45	@Espyo	one to list what each folder and file on the ISO is
2016-01-29 19:54:56	@Espyo	one to list enemy IDs
2016-01-29 19:54:56	@Espyo	etc.
2016-01-29 19:55:08	@Espyo	but I'm not quite sure if we can create a "group" folder

2016-01-29 19:58:19	@PikFan	hi
2016-01-29 19:58:27	@Espyo	ah-ha! https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1Ecsn1gpMeVRDdSN1JhcFBrdDQ&usp=sharing
2016-01-29 19:58:30	@Espyo	oh, hi PikFan
2016-01-29 19:58:41	@Espyo	I made a folder for us to dump all Pikmin 2 info
2016-01-29 19:58:43	Scruffy	Hi PikFan!
2016-01-29 19:58:46	@PikFan	nice
2016-01-29 19:58:50	@Espyo	because we reached the conclusion that we KEEP repeating the same efforts
2016-01-29 19:58:54	@Espyo	to decode this or that file
2016-01-29 19:58:58	@Espyo	or to list this or that
2016-01-29 19:58:59	@PikFan	"Espyo woz here"
2016-01-29 19:59:04	@Espyo	aye
2016-01-29 19:59:26	@PikFan	so, decoding which files? enemy parameters, I'm assuming?
2016-01-29 19:59:31	@Espyo	guess I'll remove the test
2016-01-29 19:59:35	@Espyo	well, anything we find about Pikmin 2
2016-01-29 19:59:40	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-29 19:59:48	@Espyo	I'll start with the ISO map
2016-01-29 19:59:58	@PikFan	hey, Scruffy, I need to ask you something
2016-01-29 20:00:06	@PikFan	how much do you know about birds?
2016-01-29 20:00:33	@PikFan	also, anything new?
2016-01-29 20:00:42	@PikFan	(that one was to everybody)
2016-01-29 20:01:34	Scruffy	Birds? not much
2016-01-29 20:01:43	Scruffy	But I've since learned quite a bit about Boids
2016-01-29 20:01:58	@PikFan	oh hmm
2016-01-29 20:02:08	Scruffy	It's an equation for how virtual particles move
2016-01-29 20:02:17	Scruffy	In order to behave /like/ a flock of birds
2016-01-29 20:02:39	Scruffy	And it's what guides Pikmin in the title screen of Pikmin 2

2016-01-29 20:02:56	@Espyo	nothing new, really
2016-01-29 20:02:59	@Espyo	hehe, yeah, boids
2016-01-29 20:03:07	@PikFan	because we're doing a project on birds in my bio class and one of the requirements is what cell types are unique to birds
2016-01-29 20:03:13	@PikFan	or tissues, or organs
2016-01-29 20:03:13	@Espyo	it MIGHT be what guides Pikmin, period
2016-01-29 20:03:20	@PikFan	wow
2016-01-29 20:03:26	@Espyo	I'm having a hard time understanding how to make a fluid group of Pikmin on the engine, so boids might just be the answer
2016-01-29 20:03:38	Scruffy	but Pikmin aren't fluid
2016-01-29 20:03:42	Scruffy	in the first 2 games at least
2016-01-29 20:03:50	@Espyo	better than what's on the engine
2016-01-29 20:03:56	Scruffy	There appear to be 100 positions behind Olimar into which Pikmin try to be
2016-01-29 20:03:59	@Espyo	yikes, your best bet is original research, PikFan
2016-01-29 20:04:04	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-29 20:04:08	@Espyo	well, at least that part matches the engine
2016-01-29 20:04:15	@Espyo	but making those positions behave fluidly is the tough part
2016-01-29 20:04:46	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 20:05:08	Scruffy	I dunno, it seems like for a time they hold their positions, but if you're walking for long enough they'll break formation
2016-01-29 20:05:18	@Espyo	yeah, more or less
2016-01-29 20:05:27	Scruffy	And PikFan, it might have something to do with birds' vision
2016-01-29 20:05:41	Scruffy	I know dragonflies have a cell that allows them to see /four/ primary colors
2016-01-29 20:05:54	Scruffy	So they see so much more color information than we do
2016-01-29 20:06:25	Scruffy	Also a bird egg is one cell...?
2016-01-29 20:06:39	Scruffy	And birds eggs... are unique... to... birds...
2016-01-29 20:07:06	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-29 20:07:21	@PikFan	well, we went with the four eye cells
2016-01-29 20:07:28	@PikFan	and my teacher actually liked that, so thanks!
2016-01-29 20:07:31	Scruffy	Immune system also appears unique, I'd look into that
2016-01-29 20:07:38	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-29 20:07:43	Scruffy	I don't actually know if birds have four eye cells!
2016-01-29 20:07:51	Scruffy	I was just suggesting :/
2016-01-29 20:07:55	@PikFan	I worded that badly
2016-01-29 20:08:07	@PikFan	their vision is actually tetrachromatic
2016-01-29 20:08:14	Scruffy	oh
2016-01-29 20:08:18	-->	Miles (Miles@w-18-3-19-639.hsd7.ga.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-01-29 20:08:24	@PikFan	but yeah, thanks
2016-01-29 20:08:32	Scruffy	no problem
2016-01-29 20:09:50	Scruffy	So Espyo, one document for every file in the system?
2016-01-29 20:10:04	Scruffy	More or less?
2016-01-29 20:10:15	Scruffy	that's gonna be quite the archive
2016-01-29 20:10:37	@Espyo	well, one document for every subject
2016-01-29 20:10:41	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-29 20:10:43	@Espyo	there are a lot of files we don't know about
2016-01-29 20:10:47	@Espyo	and lot of files that don't matter
2016-01-29 20:10:52	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 20:10:55	Scruffy	Like the timestamps
2016-01-29 20:11:12	@PikFan	will this research help you with your P2 mod?
2016-01-29 20:11:18	Scruffy	Probably
2016-01-29 20:11:24	@PikFan	awesome
2016-01-29 20:11:26	Scruffy	It's harder than I thought though
2016-01-29 20:11:32	@PikFan	hmm
2016-01-29 20:11:35	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2016-01-29 20:11:37	Scruffy	Like, I've already made Day 2 completely different
2016-01-29 20:11:46	@PikFan	have you seen the renamed treasures?
2016-01-29 20:11:58	Scruffy	But some treasures can't go in certain places because they'll get stuck between waypoint
2016-01-29 20:12:06	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-29 20:12:19	Scruffy	And some enemies have a habit of disappearing or not appearing, for some reason
2016-01-29 20:12:27	@PikFan	how bizarre
2016-01-29 20:12:30	Scruffy	I think there's a limit to how much I can /add/
2016-01-29 20:12:44	@PikFan	hey, how does the game react to changing the order that you get Pikmin types in?
2016-01-29 20:12:47	@Espyo	I haven't seen them, no
2016-01-29 20:13:22	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-29 20:13:39	Scruffy	You haven't! I'm sorry, I thought I had shown you
2016-01-29 20:13:50	Scruffy	You're welcome to contribute if you wish, hang on
2016-01-29 20:14:21	Scruffy	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2Vn4Yl2KuYJ10drzewND6Kzc7xp8gPdAcmbRkhnoUY/edit
2016-01-29 20:14:29	Scruffy	just ask to edit if you want
2016-01-29 20:15:38	@Espyo	thanks
2016-01-29 20:15:40	@PikFan	I don't understand Dreet Sweamer
2016-01-29 20:16:25	Scruffy	I switched the beginning letters from Sweet Dreamer
2016-01-29 20:16:38	@PikFan	I get that much
2016-01-29 20:16:40	Scruffy	It started as a placeholder, but I found the sound of it quite funny
2016-01-29 20:16:43	@Espyo	pfft, brilliant
2016-01-29 20:16:49	@PikFan	I mean, I don't understand the significa—oh
2016-01-29 20:17:09	Yoshi2	https://www.reddit.com/r/battalionwarsmod/comments/41ivvh/bw1_tundran_mortar_vet_and_xylvanian_light_recon/ yay, I received my first upvote on this post in 11 days
2016-01-29 20:17:15	Scruffy	If you're looking for significance, don't play Pikmin 2: Up Late
2016-01-29 20:17:24	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-29 20:17:24	Scruffy	And especially don't listen to the ship
2016-01-29 20:17:32	Scruffy	I finished its dialogue
2016-01-29 20:17:41	@PikFan	wow, already?
2016-01-29 20:17:47	Scruffy	It has NOTHING of helpfulness to say
2016-01-29 20:18:15	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-29 20:18:17	Scruffy	Well, most of its dialogue, there's some that depends on how the redesigned levels go
2016-01-29 20:18:35	@Espyo	have another
2016-01-29 20:18:43	Scruffy	The trouble is I keep finding some dialogues that open and just abruptly close
2016-01-29 20:18:47	@Espyo	also, Yoshi2: you should have edit access to that folder
2016-01-29 20:18:50	@Espyo	document anything you find
2016-01-29 20:18:59	Scruffy	Because a character /that I can't even see in the text file/ is out of place
2016-01-29 20:19:50	Scruffy	Like, there are invisible characters that denote button icons, text color/size changes, and the end of passages
2016-01-29 20:19:58	Scruffy	One thing missing, and the dialogue breaks
2016-01-29 20:20:29	@PikFan	sorry, gotta go now
2016-01-29 20:20:35	Scruffy	Oh, okay, see ya
2016-01-29 20:20:50	@PikFan	don't know when I'll be on again
2016-01-29 20:20:51	@PikFan	bye
2016-01-29 20:20:52	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@tzte-465-01.shs.lane.edu) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-01-29 20:22:13	Scruffy	<Espyo>: have another
2016-01-29 20:22:18	Scruffy	A treasure name?
2016-01-29 20:22:34	@Espyo	an upvote on Yoshi2's thread
2016-01-29 20:22:37	@Espyo	gotta raise awareness
2016-01-29 20:22:43	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-29 20:23:18	Yoshi2	Espyo: though my post really doesn't need many upvotes to be visible due to how reddit works
2016-01-29 20:23:37	@Espyo	you sure?
2016-01-29 20:23:42	Yoshi2	all the other posts in the sub being a year old means my stuff is guaranteed to be on the front page
2016-01-29 20:23:48	Yoshi2	of that sub
2016-01-29 20:24:41	@Espyo	right, on that sub
2016-01-29 20:24:45	@Espyo	but on more popular ones...
2016-01-29 20:26:16	@Espyo	right, ISO map done
2016-01-29 20:29:03	Scruffy	I think "plant" for Abe is Burgeoning Spiderwort...
2016-01-29 20:29:39	Scruffy	But to see any changes in treasure parameters you have to start a new save file
2016-01-29 20:30:12	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-01-29 20:30:13	@Espyo	ugh
2016-01-29 20:31:31	Scruffy	Oh, and for aiConstants
2016-01-29 20:31:42	@Espyo	feel free to add the info yourself
2016-01-29 20:31:48	Scruffy	Okay
2016-01-29 20:31:50	@Espyo	after all, this is why this global effort thing was made
2016-01-29 20:31:54	@Espyo	I'm done with formatting, too
2016-01-29 20:31:59	@Espyo	so we won't step on each other's toes
2016-01-29 20:32:42	Scruffy	I don't know how to edit it
2016-01-29 20:32:52	@Espyo	you should be able to just do it
2016-01-29 20:33:51	Scruffy	Anyone with the link can view it, but not edit ti
2016-01-29 20:34:02	Scruffy	I think there should be a setting to change that on your end
2016-01-29 20:34:39	@Espyo	but I did add you, Yoshi2, and J to the list
2016-01-29 20:35:14	Scruffy	I can download it, but there doesn't appear to be anything to allow editing
2016-01-29 20:35:56	@Espyo	are you logged in with maxxj*@gmail.com?
2016-01-29 20:36:03	@Espyo	(dunno how comfortable you are with sharing your e-mail)
2016-01-29 20:36:07	Scruffy	Oh shoot
2016-01-29 20:36:10	Scruffy	That's why
2016-01-29 20:36:14	@Espyo	(even if all users here are trustworthy)
2016-01-29 20:36:15	Scruffy	I'm logged in with the wrong email
2016-01-29 20:36:16	@Espyo	((in theory))
2016-01-29 20:36:26	Scruffy	How do you not show your email?
2016-01-29 20:36:28	@Espyo	you might be able to hot-swap on the top-right
2016-01-29 20:36:38	@Espyo	what, on this chat?
2016-01-29 20:36:51	Scruffy	no, just on google
2016-01-29 20:36:58	Scruffy	ah i see
2016-01-29 20:37:01	@Espyo	not sure if there's a way, but it shouldn't show it
2016-01-29 20:37:10	@Espyo	I know your e-mail because of En_Passant's mails
2016-01-29 20:37:38	@Espyo	if you're viewing or editing the document with only read access, you show up as an anonymous
2016-01-29 20:39:13	Scruffy	Okay then
2016-01-29 20:41:37	Scruffy	There we go, now I'm editing

2016-01-29 20:43:01	Scruffy	What does blue represent, and yellow?
2016-01-29 20:44:08	Scruffy	In the ISO map, that is
2016-01-29 20:45:48	@Espyo	I just colored files blue and folders yellow
2016-01-29 20:46:18	@Espyo	hey, do you have any comments to add to pikiParams?
2016-01-29 20:46:23	@Espyo	should be on the folder too
2016-01-29 20:54:20	Scruffy	Nothing to add so far
2016-01-29 20:54:23	@Espyo	I... don't have any more Pikmin 2 info?
2016-01-29 20:54:29	@Espyo	I thought I had a bunch of files
2016-01-29 20:54:34	Scruffy	we just eventually need to add comments on what those mean
2016-01-29 20:54:35	@Espyo	well, I have a fair few Pikmin 3 files
2016-01-29 20:54:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-29 20:54:41	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-29 20:55:01	Scruffy	I don't know if I can add new files, but I can do NaviParms if you create the document
2016-01-29 20:55:09	@Espyo	I think you can add new files
2016-01-29 20:55:33	@Espyo	actually, let me rename the current folder
2016-01-29 20:55:38	@Espyo	to just "Pikmin game research"
2016-01-29 20:55:41	@Espyo	so we can add P3 info as well
2016-01-29 20:55:48	@Espyo	and... P1 info, I GUESS
2016-01-29 20:56:56	@Espyo	there
2016-01-29 20:57:09	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 20:57:21	Scruffy	Heh, I don't even have any P1 info
2016-01-29 20:57:25	Scruffy	It's so cryptic
2016-01-29 20:57:30	@Espyo	yep

2016-01-29 20:59:23	@Espyo	(brb, dinner)
2016-01-29 20:59:39	Scruffy	see ya
2016-01-29 21:08:43	Yoshi2	oh hey
2016-01-29 21:08:51	Yoshi2	I found audio files
2016-01-29 21:08:57	Yoshi2	for that cut mission from bw2
2016-01-29 21:09:33	Yoshi2	now I'm really curious what is in the audio files
2016-01-29 21:12:38	Yoshi2	I just need to decode .adp
2016-01-29 21:15:04	@Espyo	good luck
2016-01-29 21:17:51	@J	how do I even get to edit view from the folder?
2016-01-29 21:18:46	@Espyo	from the folder, open the file you want
2016-01-29 21:18:48	@Espyo	and just edit
2016-01-29 21:18:53	@Espyo	you can open with double-clicks
2016-01-29 21:18:56	@J	it opens in some read-only view
2016-01-29 21:19:11	@J	I'm logged in with the account listed as having edit access
2016-01-29 21:19:11	@Espyo	what e-mail are you logged in with?
2016-01-29 21:19:15	@Espyo	the one that starts with j and has n--
2016-01-29 21:19:16	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-29 21:19:22	@J	I see it on info
2016-01-29 21:19:36	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/ss-21%3A19%3A26-909x1057.png
2016-01-29 21:20:13	@Espyo	well, that looks quite different from what I see
2016-01-29 21:20:17	Scruffy	Oh, you have to download the file (or the whole folder) to your Google Drive
2016-01-29 21:20:24	Scruffy	Then you can open and edit from there
2016-01-29 21:20:31	@Espyo	well, that'd explain that
2016-01-29 21:20:33	Scruffy	I think it only works if you have Google Drive
2016-01-29 21:20:35	@J	...how?
2016-01-29 21:20:50	@Espyo	you automatically "have" Google Drive
2016-01-29 21:20:52	@Espyo	at least, you should
2016-01-29 21:20:54	Scruffy	It would show up at the top center of the screen
2016-01-29 21:20:58	Scruffy	It should
2016-01-29 21:21:01	@Espyo	hey, you could edit the Pikipedia ToDo from ages ago
2016-01-29 21:21:05	Scruffy	But in your screenshot it doesn't
2016-01-29 21:21:44	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/ss-21%3A21%3A38-955x1057.png
2016-01-29 21:22:18	@J	I could, but you linked me directly to the document, not some folder thing
2016-01-29 21:22:44	@J	oh, it's the 'Open in Drive' button
2016-01-29 21:22:56	@J	so do my changes actually affect your copy, or what?
2016-01-29 21:23:23	@J	check J2 in P2 ISO map
2016-01-29 21:23:30	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-29 21:23:56	Scruffy	Yep, it shows up
2016-01-29 21:24:12	@J	okay, that's a bit weird, but sure
2016-01-29 21:24:18	Scruffy	that's what I like about Google Docs for sure
2016-01-29 21:24:28	@J	what?
2016-01-29 21:24:28	Scruffy	Google Drive is a bit convoluted to organize it though
2016-01-29 21:24:46	Scruffy	Multiple people on different computers can edit documents at the same time
2016-01-29 21:24:51	Scruffy	And message each other from it
2016-01-29 21:25:00	@Espyo	yeha
2016-01-29 21:25:02	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-01-29 21:25:11	-->	Chiaki_Nanami (Android_Pi@59-995-323-88-lr28.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #pikipedia
2016-01-29 21:25:25	Scruffy	If only Pikipedia could work that way
2016-01-29 21:25:42	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-29 21:26:12	Chiaki_Nanami	Hi.
2016-01-29 21:26:30	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-29 21:29:05	Scruffy	There's that moment what you spend an hour and a half rendering this huge image only to discover that one tiny but important detail was left "hidden" while you were editing
2016-01-29 21:29:14	Scruffy	And you have to render it again
2016-01-29 21:29:16	@Espyo	ugh
2016-01-29 21:37:06	Scruffy	Espyo, do you think you could send me the P3 folder "Shaders?" Or is it too big
2016-01-29 21:37:19	@Espyo	might be small
2016-01-29 21:37:26	@Espyo	I think they're written in OpenGL's shader language
2016-01-29 21:37:33	@Espyo	GLSL?
2016-01-29 21:37:40	Scruffy	That's the one
2016-01-29 21:37:43	@J	so we can't just upload random files?
2016-01-29 21:37:50	@Espyo	I think we can
2016-01-29 21:37:51	Scruffy	Umm
2016-01-29 21:37:54	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 21:37:56	@Espyo	but /should/ we?
2016-01-29 21:38:05	@J	I don't understand
2016-01-29 21:38:14	@Espyo	it's a shared folder
2016-01-29 21:38:19	Scruffy	I mean, uploading images of changes might be helpful
2016-01-29 21:38:25	@Espyo	we can put whatever in there, yeah
2016-01-29 21:38:30	@J	I don't have anything in mind, I'm just wondering if the file formats are restricted to those you can create
2016-01-29 21:38:36	@Espyo	but at least for now, we're just uploading spreadsheets and text documents
2016-01-29 21:38:47	@J	I can't work out how to do it
2016-01-29 21:38:47	@Espyo	which is what Google Drive allows you to create right away
2016-01-29 21:38:51	@Espyo	with its own "office" editor
2016-01-29 21:39:07	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-29 21:39:25	Scruffy	i'm better off uploading these images of edited Day 2 on Pikipedia then
2016-01-29 21:39:46	@Espyo	Scruffy: no good, all files in the shader folder are in .gsh, .sharc, or .sharcfb format
2016-01-29 21:39:52	@Espyo	plus a temp.tmp, which is actually not empty
2016-01-29 21:39:57	Scruffy	Aww man
2016-01-29 21:40:08	Scruffy	that's okay
2016-01-29 21:40:21	@Espyo	uhm
2016-01-29 21:40:27	@Espyo	looks like they can be read like a text file
2016-01-29 21:40:31	@Espyo	and besides a lot of control codes
2016-01-29 21:40:35	@Espyo	you can make up a lot in it
2016-01-29 21:40:35	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-29 21:40:39	@Espyo	it has its own programming language
2016-01-29 21:40:53	Scruffy	Interesting
2016-01-29 21:41:00	@J	gsh could just be compiled geometry shader?
2016-01-29 21:41:13	Scruffy	Yeah, I just wanted to take a look at how it handles what it does
2016-01-29 21:41:35	@Espyo	J: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/drive.png
2016-01-29 21:41:48	Scruffy	and sharc. might be shader + arc
2016-01-29 21:41:55	@Espyo	if I click the red "NOVO" ("new"), it gives me that menu on the left
2016-01-29 21:42:07	Yoshi2	I kinda wanted to decode the files using vgmstream, but it requires dll files and I have no idea where to find the dll files, or where they originate from
2016-01-29 21:42:10	@Espyo	and then I can click "Carregar um ficheiro" ("upload a file")
2016-01-29 21:42:19	@Espyo	Scruffy: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/shader.zip
2016-01-29 21:42:22	 *	UltraMario gets pinged
2016-01-29 21:42:24	UltraMario	:p
2016-01-29 21:42:35	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-01-29 21:42:37	@Espyo	"um" ficheiro
2016-01-29 21:42:45	UltraMario	;)
2016-01-29 21:43:33	Chiaki_Nanami	wait, does 'um' ping you now?
2016-01-29 21:43:48	UltraMario	yeah
2016-01-29 21:43:52	Chiaki_Nanami	ok!
2016-01-29 21:44:09	Yoshi2	I will need to keep that, um, in mind
2016-01-29 21:44:11	UltraMario	it's not case sensitive, so
2016-01-29 21:44:13	@Espyo	since "um" means "a" (singular, male) in Portuguese, you'd be hard-pressed if we spoke Portuguese :V
2016-01-29 21:44:15	UltraMario	:p
2016-01-29 21:44:22	UltraMario	lol
2016-01-29 21:47:37	Scruffy	So already this has some valuable stuff in it
2016-01-29 21:47:51	Scruffy	Pikmin 3 uses SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)
2016-01-29 21:48:42	Scruffy	Meaning it efficiently calculates object brightnesses based on global and local lights, without using any CPU processing
2016-01-29 21:48:52	Scruffy	It's all graphically processed instead
2016-01-29 21:50:31	@Espyo	ooh, nice
2016-01-29 21:52:11	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as Pi
2016-01-29 21:52:32	--	Pi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-01-29 21:54:21	Scruffy	I should have expected this, but Pikmin 3 uses a lot more lighting research than I thought
2016-01-29 21:54:33	@Espyo	it's probably insane
2016-01-29 21:55:11	Scruffy	There appears to be a shader called "Uber mode"
2016-01-29 21:55:19	@Espyo	what
2016-01-29 21:55:25	Scruffy	That contains alllllll these lighting effects
2016-01-29 21:55:36	@Espyo	Nintendo, that's straight-up teasing
2016-01-29 21:58:18	Scruffy	I see "rain effect," "leaf effect," and "outside light" here, that's about all I recognize unfortunately
2016-01-29 21:58:51	Scruffy	Oh, Fresnel! That's something I recognize
2016-01-29 21:59:03	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-29 21:59:20	Scruffy	The Fresnel effect is the principle that looking at something from a more oblique angle changes its look
2016-01-29 21:59:36	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-01-29 21:59:54	Scruffy	For example, looking straight down at water makes it effectively transparent, while looking almost parallel to water makes it reflective
2016-01-29 22:00:22	Scruffy	So that would be what dictates how reflective Wollywog skin is, for example
2016-01-29 22:00:31	Scruffy	Edges are more so than the center
2016-01-29 22:00:34	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-01-29 22:00:40	Scruffy	Because you're viewing the edges obliquely
2016-01-29 22:00:44	@Espyo	right, right
2016-01-29 22:01:07	Scruffy	They also have reflection tables
2016-01-29 22:01:30	Scruffy	which as far as I know are video games best current attempt at simulating real-life reflection
2016-01-29 22:02:25	Scruffy	I also see "Wave UV distortion," which would be for water waves
2016-01-29 22:02:40	Scruffy	But I have no idea what "squid reflection" is
2016-01-29 22:03:27	@Espyo	...Splatoon is leaking in
2016-01-29 22:03:36	@Espyo	[[Sputtlefish]]?
2016-01-29 22:03:38	Testyo	"Sputtlefish" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Sputtlefish
2016-01-29 22:04:21	Scruffy	I guess but I don't see why it would need its own reflection table
2016-01-29 22:05:04	@Espyo	hey, Pikmin 2 has Pikmin parameters for how long they last being digested inside a Jellyfloat, right?
2016-01-29 22:05:06	Scruffy	It has to apply to more than the Sputtlefish, it's appearing all over
2016-01-29 22:05:06	@Espyo	Pikmin games are weird
2016-01-29 22:05:10	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-29 22:05:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 22:05:30	Scruffy	You'd be cruel to players and Pikmin alike by decreasing it
2016-01-29 22:05:49	Scruffy	Can you imagine zero?
2016-01-29 22:05:57	Scruffy	It'd be a Vehemoth Phosbat
2016-01-29 22:06:36	Scruffy	Wooow
2016-01-29 22:06:43	Scruffy	Okay, the caustics are real
2016-01-29 22:06:52	Scruffy	I thought the caustics in P3 were faked
2016-01-29 22:06:58	Scruffy	But they're real, in real time
2016-01-29 22:07:30	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-29 22:07:32	Scruffy	I mean, obviously they still aren't accurate
2016-01-29 22:07:33	@Espyo	caustics...
2016-01-29 22:07:34	@Espyo	reflections?
2016-01-29 22:07:41	Scruffy	Almost
2016-01-29 22:07:55	Scruffy	Caustics are that point of concentrated light behind something refracted
2016-01-29 22:08:10	Scruffy	For example, put a glass of water on a sunny windowsill
2016-01-29 22:08:18	Scruffy	in its shadow will be this weird bright shape
2016-01-29 22:08:36	@Espyo	...wh-where does Pikmin 3 have that?
2016-01-29 22:08:42	Scruffy	Underwater
2016-01-29 22:08:53	Scruffy	its water casts caustics on the ground beneath it
2016-01-29 22:08:57	@Espyo	I don't think I ever noticed that
2016-01-29 22:09:05	@Espyo	oh, I know that effect now
2016-01-29 22:09:05	Scruffy	Lemme pull up a photo
2016-01-29 22:09:09	@Espyo	but I still don't recall from Pikmin 3
2016-01-29 22:09:11	@Espyo	I LOVE that effect
2016-01-29 22:09:17	@Espyo	so wait, THAT'S BEING CALCULATED AT RUN-TIME
2016-01-29 22:09:19	@Espyo	WTF, PIKMIN 3
2016-01-29 22:09:50	Scruffy	I /think/ it is
2016-01-29 22:09:59	Scruffy	It might be a texture that's being distorted
2016-01-29 22:10:07	Scruffy	But it's distorted /so/ accurately in game
2016-01-29 22:10:13	Yoshi2	vgmstream has failed me, it cannot open the audio files from BW2 :/
2016-01-29 22:10:24	@Espyo	I can only imagine it being calculated would be so heavy to the system
2016-01-29 22:10:29	@Espyo	it has to be faked with a texture
2016-01-29 22:10:49	@Espyo	Yoshi2: there might be a version more specific for those files
2016-01-29 22:11:03	Scruffy	That /would/ explain where those 8 years went
2016-01-29 22:11:06	@Espyo	like, if I want to play Pikmin 3's files, I have to switch my vgmstream dll with a specific version
2016-01-29 22:11:11	@Espyo	yeah, yikes
2016-01-29 22:11:17	@Espyo	I'd recommend you point this down
2016-01-29 22:11:20	@Espyo	and one day, write an article
2016-01-29 22:11:25	@Espyo	explaining how Pikmin 3 was underrated
2016-01-29 22:11:28	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 22:11:48	Scruffy	I was working on that in my Lighting article, but it hasn't really come together yet
2016-01-29 22:12:19	Scruffy	But I can already show people the details they've missed in Pikmin 3's graphics
2016-01-29 22:12:56	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-29 22:13:02	@Espyo	oh, I meant like a blog article of sorts
2016-01-29 22:13:09	@Espyo	but the lighting article on the wiki would be a good idea too
2016-01-29 22:13:11	@Espyo	at least, for lighting only
2016-01-29 22:13:14	@Espyo	(...duh)
2016-01-29 22:13:14	Scruffy	Oh I see
2016-01-29 22:13:38	Yoshi2	Espyo: no idea how much more specific it could get, the adp files here seem to be headerless and vgmstream just says that it failed to open the file
2016-01-29 22:13:48	@Espyo	darn
2016-01-29 22:14:05	Yoshi2	but it seems I don't really need to open the files to know the contexts
2016-01-29 22:14:25	Yoshi2	and if I wanted to hear what is in the files, I'd probably just replace existing audio files with those
2016-01-29 22:14:55	Yoshi2	there are subtitles for the audio in the string file, neat
2016-01-29 22:15:26	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-01-29 22:15:43	Yoshi2	ok
2016-01-29 22:15:46	Yoshi2	this is just mean
2016-01-29 22:15:58	Yoshi2	the string files are just EMPTY repeated over and over
2016-01-29 22:16:16	Yoshi2	so I will actually need to open the audio files somehow, ugh
2016-01-29 22:16:32	<--	M6 (BetaMaster@n-907-82-57-96.hsd9.pa.comcast.net) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2016-01-29 22:17:04	Yoshi2	I could make a comedy out of me trying to find stuff in the files of BW2
2016-01-29 22:17:05	@Espyo	pfft
2016-01-29 22:17:11	Yoshi2	because that's what this feels like
2016-01-29 22:19:21	Scruffy	Woah, about 90% of this 6.3 MB file appears to be an error log of some sort
2016-01-29 22:20:00	Scruffy	Actually never mind, this is just warning info
2016-01-29 22:22:46	Scruffy	So far that's all I can pick up out of the gobbledegook
2016-01-29 22:23:56	Scruffy	But for one thing, this looks like a lot more info than Pikmin 3 uses
2016-01-29 22:24:00	Scruffy	I mean, what do I know
2016-01-29 22:24:09	Scruffy	But it seems like this is for a lot larger game
2016-01-29 22:24:10	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-29 22:27:29	Scruffy	But now my theories are confirmed about how advanced Pikmin 3 is
2016-01-29 22:27:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-29 22:27:48	@Espyo	it definitely feels very polished
2016-01-29 22:27:58	@Espyo	and when you take a moment to think about how this or that works, you can really see
2016-01-29 22:28:04	@Espyo	I see it all the time when making the engine
2016-01-29 22:28:10	@Espyo	I try to compare with how Pikmin 3 does this or that
2016-01-29 22:28:10	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 22:28:19	@Espyo	and just become shocked to think about how much more thought it all had
2016-01-29 22:28:20	Scruffy	That's neat!
2016-01-29 22:28:27	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-29 22:28:35	@Espyo	good thing I'm going for a much, MUCH simpler engine
2016-01-29 22:28:41	@Espyo	otherwise I'd only finish in 2060
2016-01-29 22:28:44	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-29 22:28:58	Yoshi2	here's my prediction for what happens tomorrow when I check out the audio files:
2016-01-29 22:29:07	Yoshi2	I find out that they are placeholders, or in japanese
2016-01-29 22:29:46	Scruffy	I've realized that with just a few /minor/ adjustments, Pikmin and Pikmin 2 could look much more realistic (they're already ahead of the Gamecube crowd), and the GameCube could most likely handle it
2016-01-29 22:29:56	@Espyo	well, placeholders are still interesting
2016-01-29 22:29:58	@Espyo	still unused
2016-01-29 22:30:07	@Espyo	yeah, maybe
2016-01-29 22:30:16	Yoshi2	the thing with placeholders is that I have found enough placeholders as is
2016-01-29 22:30:22	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-29 22:30:30	@Espyo	yeah, I can imagine it gets frustrating
2016-01-29 22:30:36	Yoshi2	it will probably be japanese voice acting
2016-01-29 22:30:55	Yoshi2	because the size of the files changes with each file
2016-01-29 22:31:05	@Espyo	good guess
2016-01-29 22:31:10	Yoshi2	it would be awesome if it was English voice acting
2016-01-29 22:31:29	Yoshi2	because I don't have to translate that one
2016-01-29 22:32:42	Yoshi2	oh well, that will be something for tomorrow
2016-01-29 22:32:56	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-01-29 22:33:15	@Espyo	night
2016-01-29 22:33:30	@Espyo	meanwhile, I'm trying to wrestle with Ben's windows
2016-01-29 22:33:31	Yoshi2|offline	good night
2016-01-29 22:33:34	@Espyo	it's just acting completely nuts
2016-01-29 22:33:38	@Espyo	he's trying to run the engine
2016-01-29 22:33:42	@Espyo	but windows says it's not running

2016-01-29 22:47:06	@Espyo	okay, see ya
2016-01-29 22:47:14	@Espyo	En_Passant: do you use windows 10?

2016-01-29 22:47:44	En_Passant	yes
2016-01-29 22:47:49	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-01-29 22:47:52	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/PFE_test_3.exe
2016-01-29 22:48:02	@Espyo	can you download this, run it, and tell me if you see a command line prompt for 3 seconds?
2016-01-29 22:48:13	@Espyo	(command line prompt being the black window with white text)
2016-01-29 22:48:26	@Espyo	Ben from the forums cannot run this at all
2016-01-29 22:48:31	@Espyo	and I can't tell if it's his system that's broken
2016-01-29 22:48:35	@Espyo	or if windows 10 is fucking it up
2016-01-29 22:48:35	Testyo	Hey, don't swear!
2016-01-29 22:48:57	En_Passant	Could not open image Font.png
2016-01-29 22:49:07	@Espyo	well
2016-01-29 22:49:09	@Espyo	that means you can run it
2016-01-29 22:49:14	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-29 22:49:21	@Espyo	he cannot run it AT ALL
2016-01-29 22:49:23	@Espyo	like
2016-01-29 22:49:24	@Espyo	nothing appears
2016-01-29 22:49:26	@Espyo	nothing happens
2016-01-29 22:49:27	@Espyo	nothing nothing
2016-01-29 22:49:36	En_Passant	well, he should stop being bad
2016-01-29 22:49:47	@Espyo	and if we try to check if the engine really is running, but just not doing anything, we can't find it running on the system
2016-01-29 22:49:48	@Espyo	BUT
2016-01-29 22:49:56	@Espyo	if he tries deleting the .exe, windows won't let him, because it's being used
2016-01-29 22:49:58	@Espyo	just... what
2016-01-29 22:50:31	@Espyo	what's your antivirus? is it Avast?
2016-01-29 22:50:46	En_Passant	I think it's Norton
2016-01-29 22:50:55	En_Passant	I don't know if it's actually active, though
2016-01-29 22:51:01	En_Passant	I mostly just use Malwarebytes
2016-01-29 22:51:04	@Espyo	good man
2016-01-29 22:55:00	En_Passant	Do you know anything about collision in Unreal?
2016-01-29 22:57:06	@Espyo	afraid not
2016-01-29 22:57:17	@Espyo	is there any term or something you're not getting?
2016-01-29 22:57:38	En_Passant	onHit
2016-01-29 22:57:49	@Espyo	sounds like an event
2016-01-29 22:57:53	En_Passant	I'm trying to make it so Olimar adds a Pikmin into his squad by touching
2016-01-29 22:57:53	@Espyo	when there's a hit
2016-01-29 22:58:07	@Espyo	guess you're on the right track
2016-01-29 22:58:14	En_Passant	onHit looks like the function to use, but there is no information on the function
2016-01-29 22:58:35	@Espyo	what about searching on google "Unreal Engine onHit"?
2016-01-29 22:58:44	@Espyo	I usually find what functions need using google like that
2016-01-29 22:58:47	@Espyo	and it's just instantaneous
2016-01-29 22:58:55	@Espyo	because so many people always have the same questions
2016-01-29 22:59:23	En_Passant	I did that
2016-01-29 22:59:26	En_Passant	I'm not finding anything
2016-01-29 22:59:39	@Espyo	have you done any other events so far?
2016-01-29 23:00:10	En_Passant	no
2016-01-29 23:00:24	En_Passant	That's why I'm so behind, I can't find a starting point
2016-01-29 23:00:37	@Espyo	well, it does look like you're on the right track
2016-01-29 23:01:27	@Espyo	https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Events/index.html#eventhit ?
2016-01-29 23:04:04	En_Passant	Do you know what that looks like in C++?
2016-01-29 23:05:04	@Espyo	phoo, I wouldn't
2016-01-29 23:05:08	@Espyo	could be implemented in any number of ways
2016-01-29 23:05:12	@Espyo	can you show me the code you have now, if any?
2016-01-29 23:06:54	En_Passant	Potentially
2016-01-29 23:07:05	En_Passant	I recently tried switching my default documents folder to OneDrive
2016-01-29 23:07:39	En_Passant	It didn't let me switch back so I manually moved the files, but now stuff is breaking because they're trying to find the OneDrive files that don't exist
2016-01-29 23:07:39	@Espyo	I found this, btw:
2016-01-29 23:07:41	@Espyo	 FActorHitSignature: void ( AActor* SelfActor, AActor* OtherActor, FVector NormalImpulse, const FHitResult& Hit ) 
2016-01-29 23:07:49	@Espyo	ouch, that sucks
2016-01-29 23:10:02	En_Passant	I don't have anything for collision
2016-01-29 23:10:12	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-29 23:10:30	En_Passant	I've been trying to find the function for detecting a collision, after all
2016-01-29 23:10:49	@Espyo	of course
2016-01-29 23:13:56	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Template talk:News by Phineas81707 (+457 /* 895 articles */) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template_talk:News&curid=17980&diff=159440&oldid=159433
2016-01-29 23:15:10	En_Passant	I found something about an AActor:OnActorHit function
2016-01-29 23:15:10	En_Passant	Which leads into the other thing I'm trying to do, which is make Pikmin not block Olimar
2016-01-29 23:15:25	En_Passant	Right now, if you run into a wall, you get trapped by the Pikmin
2016-01-29 23:15:56	En_Passant	Actually, the collision of the Pikmin in general is poor
2016-01-29 23:16:16	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-29 23:16:24	@Espyo	well, without tweaking, I bet it's pretty basic
2016-01-29 23:17:48	En_Passant	They're being represented by cones at the moment
2016-01-29 23:18:11	@Espyo	good enough, for now
2016-01-29 23:18:31	En_Passant	But Unreal doesn't have cone collision
2016-01-29 23:18:42	En_Passant	It defaults to a cylinder
2016-01-29 23:18:45	@Espyo	you shouldn't expect it too
2016-01-29 23:18:57	@Espyo	cylinder collision is the way to go
2016-01-29 23:19:09	@Espyo	almost all games think of the game objects as cylinders
2016-01-29 23:19:11	@Espyo	or spheres
2016-01-29 23:19:16	@Espyo	cylinders are more common
2016-01-29 23:19:58	@Espyo	although my engine is kinda 2D, it also uses cylinders
2016-01-29 23:23:59	En_Passant	so this is why I didn't like OneDrive
2016-01-29 23:24:00	En_Passant	http://imgur.com/vLYPBE2
2016-01-29 23:24:12	@Espyo	yikes
2016-01-29 23:24:13	@Espyo	good grief
2016-01-29 23:25:23	En_Passant	The problem is that I can't move the cylinder
2016-01-29 23:25:32	En_Passant	It's locked with its center at the origin
2016-01-29 23:25:51	@Espyo	you can't define its center, you mean?
2016-01-29 23:25:58	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-29 23:26:10	@Espyo	and you could with a cone?
2016-01-29 23:26:33	En_Passant	The cone's not the base component, so yes
2016-01-29 23:26:44	@Espyo	it should be possible, though
2016-01-29 23:26:54	@Espyo	at least define whether its center is in the middle of the cylinder or on the base of the cylinder
2016-01-29 23:27:05	@Espyo	most games have it on the base, though middle isn't unheard of
2016-01-29 23:27:17	En_Passant	It's also a rounded cylinder
2016-01-29 23:27:32	@Espyo	well, that shouldn't make a difference in terms of collision checking
2016-01-29 23:27:33	En_Passant	Why the base isn't flat, which any sane collision should be, is beyond me
2016-01-29 23:28:22	@Espyo	surely it can't have an impact on the collision
2016-01-29 23:29:45	En_Passant	It doesn't?
2016-01-29 23:30:11	@Espyo	you're saying the base is not flat
2016-01-29 23:30:17	@Espyo	but this is on the cylinder you can see, right?
2016-01-29 23:30:28	@Espyo	the cylinder it's actually using for collision is probably a simple cylinder
2016-01-29 23:31:09	@Espyo	I'm trying to visualize how Unreal works
2016-01-29 23:31:17	@Espyo	combining both the visuals with the underlying code
2016-01-29 23:32:05	En_Passant	Why make them different?
2016-01-29 23:33:06	@Espyo	because there's no need to make tiny checks for the small bumps at the cylinder's base
2016-01-29 23:33:10	@Espyo	when a simple cylinder check works perfectly
2016-01-29 23:33:12	@Espyo	and is much faster
2016-01-29 23:33:22	@Espyo	the fact that the cylinder you see is smoothed is probably just to look pretty
2016-01-29 23:33:33	@Espyo	unless it really IS showing you EXACTLY what collision model it's using
2016-01-29 23:33:37	@Espyo	but I think that's very unlikely
2016-01-29 23:34:31	En_Passant	Oh, wait, I see
2016-01-29 23:34:35	En_Passant	It's not a cylinder
2016-01-29 23:34:39	En_Passant	It's a capsule
2016-01-29 23:34:46	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-29 23:34:52	@Espyo	that's a possible collision model too, I guess
2016-01-29 23:35:12	@Espyo	but it might be checking for collisions like a cylinder, and just looks like a capsule
2016-01-29 23:36:03	@Espyo	well, that doesn't really matter
2016-01-29 23:36:11	@Espyo	you could even use circle or box collision shapes, at this point
2016-01-29 23:41:45	En_Passant	I don't know how to do that

2016-01-30 12:10:09	Yoshi2	I can hear the audio files in the game
2016-01-30 12:10:11	Chiaki_Nanami	:o
2016-01-30 12:10:14	Chiaki_Nanami	!!!
2016-01-30 12:10:19	Chiaki_Nanami	:D
2016-01-30 12:10:52	Yoshi2	still a pain in the butt to do because I have to rebuild the battalion wars iso each time I want to hear different files
2016-01-30 12:12:21	Yoshi2	but at least I can listen to up to 20 or so different files at once by replacing specific audio files that are played in the level select screen

2016-01-30 12:48:08	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-30 12:48:09	Testyo	hey, I mention where to be different species
2016-01-30 12:52:00	Yoshi2	I really need the japanese version of BW2
2016-01-30 12:54:23	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-30 12:54:37	@Espyo	I'm guessing you tried searching for the Japanese name already
2016-01-30 12:57:33	Yoshi2	I'm doing that right now
2016-01-30 12:57:55	Yoshi2	Espyo: good news: the audio files are actually English voice acting
2016-01-30 12:57:59	@Espyo	it's never easy
2016-01-30 12:58:02	@Espyo	oh, nice, at least
2016-01-30 12:58:15	Yoshi2	but not by the same people who did the final audio, or at least not in the same quality
2016-01-30 12:58:35	Yoshi2	it's kinda hilarious in some places, feels like a first take or something like that
2016-01-30 12:58:44	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-01-30 12:58:51	@Espyo	much better than placeholders then
2016-01-30 12:59:01	Yoshi2	yup
2016-01-30 12:59:20	@Espyo	heck, much better than plain old unused clips, too
2016-01-30 12:59:29	@Espyo	nothing beats finding comedy hidden inside a game's unused files
2016-01-30 12:59:38	@Espyo	and well, if you say that some sound like a first take
2016-01-30 12:59:42	@Espyo	that's funny enough in my book
2016-01-30 12:59:56	Yoshi2	not exactly first take, but pretty rough on some edges
2016-01-30 13:00:02	@Espyo	right, right
2016-01-30 13:00:32	Yoshi2	I need the japanese files so I can compare this
2016-01-30 13:01:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-30 13:02:42	Yoshi2	*cough* I don't remember torrenting being this tedious *cough*
2016-01-30 13:02:49	Yoshi2	0 seeders, come oooon
2016-01-30 13:03:10	@Espyo	ugh, yeah
2016-01-30 13:03:44	@Espyo	you search for minutes on the shadiest websites there are, only to find a tooooooooo--thingie with 0 seeders
2016-01-30 13:03:52	@Espyo	and it's been uploaded back in 2010 or something
2016-01-30 13:06:06	Yoshi2	ohgod, I think I might have found something
2016-01-30 13:06:36	@Espyo	embrace for disappointment...
2016-01-30 13:07:03	Yoshi2	there is hope
2016-01-30 13:07:25	@Espyo	prove me wrong,
2016-01-30 13:07:28	@Espyo	random comma
2016-01-30 13:07:29	Yoshi2	unless it's infected
2016-01-30 13:07:42	@Espyo	I honestly haven't really seen an infected torrent
2016-01-30 13:07:48	@Espyo	not for a game, at least
2016-01-30 13:07:53	Yoshi2	me neither
2016-01-30 13:09:28	Yoshi2	anyway, my love for battalion wars is stronger than my fear
2016-01-30 13:09:37	@Espyo	that's the spirit
2016-01-30 13:09:57	Yoshi2	seeders: 0
2016-01-30 13:10:00	Yoshi2	knew it
2016-01-30 13:10:14	@Espyo	...
2016-01-30 13:11:40	Yoshi2	second idea
2016-01-30 13:11:58	Yoshi2	I start all the ones I find and see which one actually manages to advance
2016-01-30 13:12:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-30 13:16:19	@J	if you find anything that really sounds like an outtake, be sure to share it
2016-01-30 13:17:18	@Espyo	^
2016-01-30 13:17:39	Yoshi2	I'll definitely record this once I find a way to mute all the sounds in the game
2016-01-30 13:18:47	@J	is there not an option to do that in-game?
2016-01-30 13:20:36	Yoshi2	well
2016-01-30 13:20:44	Yoshi2	there actually is, I'm suprised
2016-01-30 13:20:54	Yoshi2	J: thanks for the idea
2016-01-30 13:22:08	Yoshi2	that means there is nothing standing between me and recording the voice acting
2016-01-30 13:23:13	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-30 13:24:15	Yoshi2	just need to dump audio
2016-01-30 13:32:38	Yoshi2	so the level select in bw2 goes 1.1 - 1.5, 2.1 - 2.3, 3.1 - 3.4, 5.1 - 5.4
2016-01-30 13:32:52	Yoshi2	which means I can listen to 16 audio files in one setting
2016-01-30 13:37:42	Yoshi2	I forgot 4.1-4.3
2016-01-30 13:38:02	Yoshi2	that makes it 5 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 19
2016-01-30 13:38:38	@J	I just remember doing the same in Pikmin 2 to record sound effects
2016-01-30 13:38:53	@J	...you just need to stay far away from the ship and Ravening Whiskerpillars
2016-01-30 13:38:54	@J	so loud
2016-01-30 13:39:21	@J	uh, Ravenous
2016-01-30 13:39:33	@J	Ravening wouldn't be a bad name
2016-01-30 13:50:59	Yoshi2	this person tries to be so british, it almost hurts
2016-01-30 13:59:09	@Espyo	Ravenous sounds so right and so wrong
2016-01-30 13:59:28	@Espyo	but every area has background sound effects
2016-01-30 13:59:32	@Espyo	birds chirping, wind blowing...
2016-01-30 13:59:44	@Espyo	I remember trying to destroy the audio file until those sound effects got deleted
2016-01-30 13:59:47	@Espyo	but never got it to work

2016-01-30 14:21:33	Yoshi2	I just noticed I had audio dumping enabled all the time
2016-01-30 14:21:46	@Espyo	eep
2016-01-30 14:22:11	Yoshi2	strangely, the file is only 12 minutes long
2016-01-30 14:22:32	Yoshi2	at least frame dumping wasn't enabled
2016-01-30 14:22:39	Yoshi2	now that would've blown my hdd up
2016-01-30 14:23:13	@J	can you not dump compressed frames?
2016-01-30 14:25:07	Yoshi2	J: I like losslessly compressed frames, which are still pretty big
2016-01-30 14:25:51	Yoshi2	anyway, I only need audio for this, so that doesn't matter much
2016-01-30 14:26:02	@J	on Linux you could have a virtual filesystem that compresses everything you write to it
2016-01-30 14:26:09	@J	gzip or something, still lossless
2016-01-30 14:26:14	@J	though can't it do PNG?
2016-01-30 14:26:23	@J	oh, that's what you meant
2016-01-30 14:26:34	@J	fair enough, though I can't see it being that large

2016-01-30 14:33:19	@Espyo	it should
2016-01-30 14:33:25	@Espyo	what if you pause emulation?
2016-01-30 14:33:36	Yoshi2	maybe I should've paused
2016-01-30 14:39:33	Yoshi2	oh well, I recorded it again, and this time it was fine
2016-01-30 14:53:40	Yoshi2	now, if I can mix a picture into this, I can upload this to youtube
2016-01-30 15:06:09	Yoshi2	success
2016-01-30 15:06:20	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-30 15:06:26	@Espyo	what about the Japanese ROM hunt?
2016-01-30 15:08:15	Yoshi2	I found one torrent with 2 guys who are at 94%
2016-01-30 15:08:20	Yoshi2	like, what the hell
2016-01-30 15:09:04	@Espyo	ugh
2016-01-30 15:09:14	Yoshi2	both japanese, obviously
2016-01-30 15:09:40	Yoshi2	I guess there is not much demand from non-japanese people for a japanese version of the game
2016-01-30 15:10:39	Yoshi2	inb4 I walk into a nintendo honeypot
2016-01-30 15:36:33	Yoshi2	k, here's the voice acting for one of the two characters involved in this cut mission
2016-01-30 15:36:34	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvvZCmmx2mQ
2016-01-30 15:37:56	Yoshi2	the other character has 33 audio clips, so I will need two recording attempts
2016-01-30 15:39:39	@Espyo	ugh, thank you for adding a bit of padding between the clips
2016-01-30 15:39:45	@Espyo	I hate videos like this that have one clip right after the other
2016-01-30 15:47:58	Yoshi2	Espyo: the padding comes from me selecting different missions to hear the different audio clips
2016-01-30 15:48:28	@Espyo	STILL good
2016-01-30 15:48:57	Yoshi2	I also wrote down the files the clips belong to
2016-01-30 15:49:23	Yoshi2	in the video description
2016-01-30 15:49:41	Yoshi2	(or at least the files I think the clips belong to. User error on my side is always possible)

2016-01-30 16:22:21	Yoshi2	heh
2016-01-30 16:58:59	Yoshi2	thank god for people who write comprehensive guides
2016-01-30 17:00:28	Yoshi2	none of the multiplayer missions that exist in bw2 are about destroying a prototype, so these audio files are definitely unused and not old variants of other voice acting pieces
2016-01-30 17:01:32	Yoshi2	which could mean that localization started before the mission was cut
2016-01-30 17:01:38	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-30 17:02:17	Yoshi2	or the more boring theory, they didn't know it was unused so at first they tried to localize it
2016-01-30 17:02:43	@Espyo	I think that's the funner theory
2016-01-30 17:02:57	@Espyo	"what do you MEAN we just paid 4 actors to voice something that won't be in the game?!"
2016-01-30 17:03:08	Yoshi2	if you look at it that way, yeah
2016-01-30 17:03:36	Yoshi2	I need the japanese release, which iirc came out earlier than the others
2016-01-30 17:20:16	Yoshi2	the internet really sucks at preserving non-popular stuff
2016-01-30 17:20:50	@Espyo	ugh, yeah
2016-01-30 17:25:14	Yoshi2	p2p filesharing is especially bad at that, but one-click hosters aren't much better because they like to purge downloads after a while if they aren't used

2016-01-30 22:31:38	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-30 22:32:58	Chiaki_Nanami	It's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?

2016-01-30 23:49:04	@PikFan	hi
2016-01-30 23:49:32	@PikFan	ok, so last night I had a weird Pikmin-related dream
2016-01-30 23:49:46	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-30 23:49:58	@PikFan	apparently you needed proof that Blue Pikmin could carry bomb rocks
2016-01-30 23:50:45	@PikFan	and I said I could grab a screenshot, but for some reason you said you needed a video
2016-01-30 23:51:02	@PikFan	I don't know, it was really random
2016-01-30 23:51:29	Chiaki_Nanami	what
2016-01-30 23:51:33	Chiaki_Nanami	Why blues
2016-01-30 23:51:39	Chiaki_Nanami	why
2016-01-30 23:51:50	@PikFan	because dreams
2016-01-30 23:51:58	Chiaki_Nanami	good point
2016-01-30 23:52:14	@PikFan	and dreams hardly ever make sense
2016-01-30 23:55:31	@PikFan	oh, also: they could also carry bomb rocks in Pikmin 3 AND Pikmin 1, but not Pikmin 2, for whatever reason
2016-01-30 23:55:55	@PikFan	and Espyo needed proof from both games
2016-01-30 23:57:07	Chiaki_Nanami	?????????.
2016-01-30 23:57:13	Chiaki_Nanami	that is all
2016-01-30 23:57:42	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-30 23:58:16	@Espyo	huh?
2016-01-30 23:58:20	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-30 23:58:22	@Espyo	never mind me
2016-01-30 23:58:45	@Espyo	heh, pretty neat
2016-01-30 23:58:54	@Espyo	also apparently they WERE meant to carry in P2
2016-01-30 23:59:06	@PikFan	wow, really?
2016-01-30 23:59:14	@Espyo	yeah, there are some parameters for a lot of bomb-related things
2016-01-30 23:59:22	@Espyo	do you have the link to the research folder?
2016-01-30 23:59:26	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-30 23:59:34	@PikFan	well...no
2016-01-30 23:59:41	@Espyo	go to the research folder, there's a file there where I translated the Pikmin parameters

2016-01-31 00:08:45	@PikFan	oh, unrelated, but last night I traced PNF-404's map texture so I can create the map for my story
2016-01-31 00:09:06	@PikFan	it actually turned out pretty good
2016-01-31 00:09:22	@PikFan	now I just have to color it in and such
2016-01-31 00:12:11	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-01-31 00:16:15	@Espyo	did I mention before?
2016-01-31 00:16:18	@Espyo	I sometimes dream of Pikmin areas
2016-01-31 00:16:24	@Espyo	they're pretty bad for areas
2016-01-31 00:16:40	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-31 00:17:04	@PikFan	no, I don't think you've mentioned areas specifically
2016-01-31 00:20:48	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-31 00:20:54	@Espyo	it's mostly what I dream about, when it's a Pikmin dream
2016-01-31 00:21:00	@Espyo	although I did dream up a good place at one point
2016-01-31 00:21:08	@Espyo	...a kitchen countertop
2016-01-31 00:21:09	@Espyo	so simple
2016-01-31 00:21:12	@Espyo	but so ...good
2016-01-31 00:21:15	@Espyo	I want to play there
2016-01-31 00:21:29	Chiaki_Nanami	That somehow reminds me of the Shower Room.
2016-01-31 00:21:42	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-01-31 00:22:24	@PikFan	I remember one time you said you were fighting an Emperor Bulblax with a kitchen towel
2016-01-31 00:23:07	Chiaki_Nanami	Well, he is rather pathetic in P2...
2016-01-31 00:23:31	@PikFan	*cough*purples*cough*
2016-01-31 00:23:42	Chiaki_Nanami	I know
2016-01-31 00:23:46	Chiaki_Nanami	It's super easy
2016-01-31 00:23:53	Chiaki_Nanami	Literally 5 seconds
2016-01-31 00:24:03	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-31 00:25:46	Chiaki_Nanami	It's so sad how much he was nerfed from P1
2016-01-31 00:25:59	@PikFan	I agree
2016-01-31 00:26:20	@PikFan	but even then, in P2, he'd still be easy
2016-01-31 00:26:26	Chiaki_Nanami	I get it, he was the Final Boss(tm) of P1, but he could have been a little bit more menacing.
2016-01-31 00:26:40	@PikFan	tm?

2016-01-31 12:14:26	Yoshi2	also, in the process I noticed that the game has unused mission briefing clips
2016-01-31 12:16:40	Yoshi2	just different recordings of the text that was used in the game, but still quite a gold mine
2016-01-31 12:16:46	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-01-31 12:18:04	Yoshi2	on the one hand, it was planned that the mission briefing wouldn't be done by a narrator but by the characters themselves
2016-01-31 12:18:39	Yoshi2	on the other hand, there are are audio clips for the mission briefing from like 3 different narrators
2016-01-31 12:18:47	Yoshi2	-are
2016-01-31 12:19:13	Yoshi2	one that is used in the final game, one that is unused but a bit like the final narrator, and one who has such a super smooth voice that it sounds weird

2016-01-31 19:10:34	Yoshi2	I think that battalion wars is a bit less complex than pikmin due to how each level is self-contained, and all the data you need is contained in a few files per level
2016-01-31 19:10:47	Yoshi2	while pikmin has the files all over the place
2016-01-31 19:23:25	Yoshi2	kuju entertainment (developers of BW) are UK-based, holy crap

2016-01-31 19:29:06	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'm stupid, the Japanese version of the game is NOT the first version to be released
2016-01-31 19:29:29	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-31 19:29:43	Yoshi2	the first version is NA in october 2007, followed by Europe in feb 2008
2016-01-31 19:29:48	Yoshi2	and Japan is actually last
2016-01-31 19:29:56	Yoshi2	almost last
2016-01-31 19:30:23	Yoshi2	so I should actually be going for the NA release of the game
2016-01-31 19:33:10	Yoshi2	the NA version should be easy to get
2016-01-31 19:36:14	Yoshi2	>first result I find has 0 seeders and one guy at 80%
2016-01-31 19:36:18	Yoshi2	what is wrong with my luck
2016-01-31 19:41:49	Yoshi2	what the hell, the PAL version is actually less rare than the NA version
2016-01-31 19:52:31	Yoshi2	I can only repeat myself, the internet absolutely sucks at preserving stuff

2016-01-31 20:06:07	@J	I never learned how it's done
2016-01-31 20:07:51	Yoshi2	J: easy enough with homebrew on the wii
2016-01-31 20:08:10	Yoshi2	but it requires me having a copy of the game
2016-01-31 20:08:25	@J	oh, I assumed you did
2016-01-31 20:08:41	@J	oh, a different region you mean
2016-01-31 20:08:45	@J	yeah...
2016-01-31 20:10:06	Yoshi2	different region = additional costs and time
2016-01-31 20:10:27	Yoshi2	although importing from the USA is probably easier than from Japan

2016-01-31 20:21:13	Yoshi2	for a moment there was hope, and then the hope disappeared

2016-01-31 20:22:23	Yoshi2	this is why I generally don't like to pirate anything
2016-01-31 20:37:40	@Espyo	ok... "What's your favorite Pikmin area?" and "What genre would you like to see a spin-off take?" are tied. which of the two polls do you lot prefer would be the next?
2016-01-31 20:42:16	Yoshi2	hmm, I'd pick the genre one
2016-01-31 20:44:27	@Espyo	I honestly like either one
2016-01-31 20:44:35	@Espyo	but if I really had to vote, I'd go with area
2016-01-31 20:44:41	@Espyo	the genre one still needs some thinking through
2016-01-31 20:44:43	@Espyo	I mean, shooter? really?
2016-01-31 20:44:57	Yoshi2	first person adventure
2016-01-31 20:45:05	@Espyo	that'd be better
2016-01-31 20:46:01	Yoshi2	although adventure is already listed in the options

2016-02-01 18:55:35	@Espyo	hurray
2016-02-01 18:55:51	Yoshi2	oddly enough, the NTSC version already had all the localized text for the European release
2016-02-01 18:56:08	Yoshi2	makes me wonder why there is a such a big gap between NTSC and PAL
2016-02-01 18:56:18	@Espyo	Nintendo's always weird like that
2016-02-01 18:56:53	Yoshi2	hm, actually
2016-02-01 18:57:04	Yoshi2	it is missing the localized graphics
2016-02-01 18:57:51	Yoshi2	still, 4 months (or so) is a lot
2016-02-01 18:58:54	Yoshi2	as far as I can tell, there is little difference in content
2016-02-01 18:59:32	Yoshi2	so going for the ntsc version was a waste of time, woohoo
2016-02-01 19:03:10	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-01 19:05:29	Yoshi2	I also found that the game tries to load a bunch of levels that don't exist anymore on startup

2016-02-01 19:16:28	Yoshi2	the best part is how the game usually only has a online mode, but when trying to load the MP levels by replacing a regular level, it actually becomes a (buggy) splitscreen mode

2016-02-01 20:26:28	@PikFan	okay, so
2016-02-01 20:26:49	@PikFan	I wasn't on chat yesterday but I saw that you updated the featured whatnot on Pikipedia
2016-02-01 20:26:58	@PikFan	so we have to do the same on Fanon
2016-02-01 20:27:05	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-01 20:27:11	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-02-01 20:27:20	@PikFan	Espyo, can you make this poll? [[f:PikminFanon:Polls]]

2016-02-01 20:27:35	@Espyo	nope
2016-02-01 20:27:36	@PikFan	ok, that's nonexistent
2016-02-01 20:28:03	@PikFan	wait, here we go http://www.pikminfanon.com/PikminFanon_talk:Poll/Suggestions
2016-02-01 20:28:15	@PikFan	make the top one, please
2016-02-01 20:28:33	@Espyo	hm, all right
2016-02-01 20:28:38	@PikFan	thanks
2016-02-01 20:28:46	@PikFan	meanwhile, I'm going to update the featured image
2016-02-01 20:29:55	@Espyo	how's about I turn "Music/Sound design" into "Audio design"?
2016-02-01 20:30:00	@Espyo	awkward answers are always...awkward
2016-02-01 20:30:07	@PikFan	sure
2016-02-01 20:30:54	@PikFan	also, for the archived polls on Pikipedia, the boxes need better contrast
2016-02-01 20:31:06	@PikFan	it's hard to tell between dark red and dark green
2016-02-01 20:31:34	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-01 20:31:41	@Espyo	I might be seeing it fine because of the KopPad theme
2016-02-01 20:31:45	@Espyo	okay, I'll improve it
2016-02-01 20:31:52	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-02-01 20:31:55	@PikFan	thanks
2016-02-01 20:32:11	@PikFan	sorry to suddenly appear and start demanding things :P
2016-02-01 20:32:12	@Espyo	are you SURE you want the last two options?
2016-02-01 20:32:13	@Espyo	specially the last one?
2016-02-01 20:32:16	@Espyo	eh it's fine
2016-02-01 20:32:27	@Espyo	it's for the community, and it's a 2-minute thing; I can't say no
2016-02-01 20:32:41	@PikFan	get rid of the last one if you'd like
2016-02-01 20:32:42	@Espyo	having a "meh" option will almost always make it be the winner
2016-02-01 20:33:03	@Espyo	when people get to vote on a poll, they either have a vague idea of what they want, or they're adamant about what they want
2016-02-01 20:33:08	@Espyo	if they're adamant, they'll pick their option
2016-02-01 20:33:24	@Espyo	if not, they'll see the "meh" option, and that'll be the one that fits them most
2016-02-01 20:33:31	@Espyo	and most people aren't 100% sure of what they want
2016-02-01 20:33:35	@Espyo	not even 90% or 80%
2016-02-01 20:33:41	@Espyo	source: my ass, but c'mon, you know it's true
2016-02-01 20:33:51	@PikFan	okay, yeah, get rid of the last two
2016-02-01 20:33:59	@Espyo	people like to contribute, but not really to choose
2016-02-01 20:34:12	@Espyo	and of course, the final one is just begging to be picked by trolls
2016-02-01 20:34:40	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-01 20:35:00	@Espyo	meanwhile: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Tropical_Wilds&curid=18378&diff=159507&oldid=146433
2016-02-01 20:35:12	@Espyo	I used my handy dandy plotter, and sure enough, there are Skitter Leaves
2016-02-01 20:35:16	@Espyo	they're right next to the spawn point
2016-02-01 20:35:37	@PikFan	this guy...
2016-02-01 20:35:46	@PikFan	he must be like 9 or something
2016-02-01 20:35:47	@Espyo	he talks a lot, and says a lot of stuff wrong
2016-02-01 20:35:48	@Espyo	also arrogant
2016-02-01 20:35:52	@Espyo	yeah, I feel like he's 9-10
2016-02-01 20:36:29	@PikFan	kinda reminds me of that one anon that kept adding wrong stuff to all those pages, and we had to eventually block him
2016-02-01 20:36:47	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2016-02-01 20:36:59	@Espyo	heh
2016-02-01 20:37:03	@Espyo	except he talks more than he barks
2016-02-01 20:37:09	@PikFan	so January 28th was the 5 year anniversary that I made an account on Fanon
2016-02-01 20:37:09	Yoshi2	more like ~13, if I had to guess
2016-02-01 20:37:13	@Espyo	and some of his edits are good
2016-02-01 20:37:18	@Espyo	yay
2016-02-01 20:37:25	@PikFan	5 years...
2016-02-01 20:37:26	@Espyo	yeah, definitely young
2016-02-01 20:37:31	@Espyo	 10 is maybe not smart enough
2016-02-01 20:37:37	@Espyo	he doesn't seem to be dumb
2016-02-01 20:37:38	@Espyo	like, child dumb
2016-02-01 20:37:41	@PikFan	my fangame will turn 5 years later this month
2016-02-01 20:37:46	@Espyo	he just seems like a bratty teenager, as all teenagers are
2016-02-01 20:37:47	@PikFan	yeah, he's just...
2016-02-01 20:37:56	@PikFan	hey, I'm not bratty
2016-02-01 20:38:04	@Espyo	well, neither was I
2016-02-01 20:38:16	@Espyo	but you know, you always end up looking back when you're older, and thinking you are
2016-02-01 20:38:20	@PikFan	true
2016-02-01 20:38:30	@Espyo	it's incredible to think back about the time we spent on these wikis
2016-02-01 20:38:37	@Espyo	it feels like just a couple of years, but it's ages

2016-02-01 20:39:25	@Espyo	talk about the poll options

2016-02-01 20:39:32	@Espyo	randomize option order?
2016-02-01 20:39:35	@Espyo	custom answers?

2016-02-01 20:39:53	Chiaki_Nanami	*conversation

2016-02-01 20:40:33	@PikFan	well, custom answers maybe, but it could also just be a potential "meh" option
2016-02-01 20:41:02	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-01 20:41:04	@Espyo	plus trolling
2016-02-01 20:41:16	@Espyo	I honestly wouldn't mark any of them
2016-02-01 20:41:22	@Espyo	multiple answers doesn't make much sense
2016-02-01 20:41:26	@Espyo	randomizing is pretty eh
2016-02-01 20:41:31	@Espyo	randomizing is good to avoid bias, but...
2016-02-01 20:41:49	@PikFan	right, let's make this a standard poll then
2016-02-01 20:41:52	@Espyo	keep poll open forever? Pikipedia's's are open forever
2016-02-01 20:42:07	@PikFan	Pikipedia's's? that's new
2016-02-01 20:42:14	@Espyo	how else do you say it?

2016-02-01 20:42:35	@PikFan	ugh, linguistics
2016-02-01 20:42:36	@Espyo	well, I'm dumb
2016-02-01 20:42:38	@Espyo	ANYWAY...
2016-02-01 20:42:40	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-01 20:42:50	@Espyo	your answer?
2016-02-01 20:43:09	@PikFan	well, just do it like it is on the page
2016-02-01 20:43:11	@J	it happened again, I accidentally made 2 sandwiches with a shared bit of bread between
2016-02-01 20:43:19	@PikFan	plus the audio thing and the removal of the last two
2016-02-01 20:43:21	@PikFan	waht
2016-02-01 20:43:23	@PikFan	*what
2016-02-01 20:43:35	@Espyo	but that doesn't answer my question
2016-02-01 20:43:39	@Espyo	J: don't the Americans call that a whopper?
2016-02-01 20:43:40	@J	luckily, with a little surgery, I just have a tuna sandwich tasting slightly of jam, and a jam sandwich tasting slightly of tuna
2016-02-01 20:43:49	Chiaki_Nanami	how does that happen accidentally, J?
2016-02-01 20:43:49	@Espyo	well
2016-02-01 20:43:54	@J	it's so easy
2016-02-01 20:44:05	@J	when making sandwiches you have to put 2 slices of bread after the filling
2016-02-01 20:44:08	@J	but I put 1
2016-02-01 20:44:12	@PikFan	err... I don't know that we call that a whopper
2016-02-01 20:44:38	Chiaki_Nanami	The only whopper that I know of is the one that Burger King serves.
2016-02-01 20:44:58	@Espyo	hide all results, only show percentages, or show results to voters?
2016-02-01 20:45:10	Chiaki_Nanami	show results to voters
2016-02-01 20:45:33	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-01 20:45:40	@PikFan	just do it like Pikipedia does
2016-02-01 20:46:25	@PikFan	ugh
2016-02-01 20:46:34	@PikFan	I am way too distracted
2016-02-01 20:46:48	@PikFan	I was hoping to use my lunch break to hopefully fix Fanon's poll system
2016-02-01 20:46:52	@PikFan	but NOPE
2016-02-01 20:46:57	@PikFan	I keep worrying about the time too much
2016-02-01 20:47:04	@PikFan	and because of that, I got nothing done
2016-02-01 20:47:06	@PikFan	typical
2016-02-01 20:47:43	Chiaki_Nanami	very
2016-02-01 20:47:44	@PikFan	well, do you at least have the poll ID?
2016-02-01 20:47:58	@PikFan	I'll just save it somewhere and grab it later

2016-02-01 20:49:03	@Espyo	no problem
2016-02-01 20:49:22	@Espyo	uhm
2016-02-01 20:49:24	@Espyo	it won't have a custom theme
2016-02-01 20:49:35	@Espyo	since I don't have a premium account, you can't choose the style
2016-02-01 20:49:40	@Espyo	well, not a custom style, anyway
2016-02-01 20:49:49	@Espyo	maybe that leaf-like texture is one of the available styles?
2016-02-01 20:49:51	@Espyo	I didn't really check
2016-02-01 20:50:02	@PikFan	that's fine
2016-02-01 20:50:10	@PikFan	I don't care about a custom theme
2016-02-01 20:50:20	@Espyo	nope, no leafy thingy
2016-02-01 20:50:20	@PikFan	aren't Pikipedia's polls plain?
2016-02-01 20:50:26	@Espyo	they are
2016-02-01 20:50:29	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-01 20:50:44	@PikFan	I want the polls to be like Pikipedia's
2016-02-01 20:51:09	@PikFan	I was actually considering at one point for Fanon's polls to be the same as Pikipedia's, but then I realized: duplicate votes
2016-02-01 20:51:14	@PikFan	and that's not helpful
2016-02-01 20:51:21	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-02-01 20:51:56	@PikFan	hopefully I'll update the featured image later today
2016-02-01 20:52:18	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-02-01 20:52:31	@PikFan	so, I've been thinking of writing a Splatoon story
2016-02-01 20:52:50	@PikFan	it'd explain why the Octarians stole the Great Zapfish
2016-02-01 20:52:55	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Poll that any better?
2016-02-01 20:53:09	@PikFan	yes, lots better

2016-02-01 20:54:34	@Espyo	but eesh
2016-02-01 20:54:38	@PikFan	but yeah, in my Splatoon story, I was thinking that eventually the Inklings and Octarians would team up against some new race
2016-02-01 20:54:54	@Espyo	kind of an overdone concept
2016-02-01 20:54:55	@PikFan	they'll be nautiluses, I'm thinking
2016-02-01 20:54:57	@Espyo	plus loads of people had that same idea
2016-02-01 20:55:02	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-02-01 20:55:05	@Espyo	but don't let that discourage you
2016-02-01 20:55:27	@PikFan	the problem with story writing is that almost all ideas have been used a lot

2016-02-01 21:11:20	@Espyo	I'm thinking of creating a [citation needed] template for Pikipedia
2016-02-01 21:11:36	@Espyo	since we have questionable stuff here and there
2016-02-01 21:11:41	Yoshi2	go for it
2016-02-01 21:11:51	@Espyo	but videos and in-game quotes are sufficient ways to prove some things
2016-02-01 21:11:58	@Espyo	but they're not citable
2016-02-01 21:12:02	@Espyo	ok, in-game text is
2016-02-01 21:12:04	@Espyo	but videos aren't
2016-02-01 21:12:11	@Espyo	so... would "citation" needed really be the best way to put it?
2016-02-01 21:12:18	@Espyo	since a video can just as well justify something?
2016-02-01 21:12:52	@Espyo	"source needed"?
2016-02-01 21:12:54	@Espyo	sounds wrong
2016-02-01 21:13:22	@Espyo	I guess either of them would work, but which one is /better/?

2016-02-01 21:43:11	Yoshi2	trying to fix the splitscreen mode is pretty annoying
2016-02-01 21:43:25	Yoshi2	there are some things I cannot do because they crash the game
2016-02-01 21:43:45	@Espyo	I bet
2016-02-01 21:43:53	@Espyo	right, I guess I'll go with "source needed"
2016-02-01 21:44:02	@Espyo	Wikipedia likes to use the word source a lot as well

2016-02-02 20:28:24	Yoshi2	I wanted to look something up in an online dictionary and the first thing I typed in was a file extension

2016-02-02 20:31:56	@Espyo	hehe
2016-02-02 20:36:12	Yoshi2	the file format I talked about can be interpreted as a 512x512 image with 6 bytes of data per pixel, and for some reason it is interlaced
2016-02-02 20:36:33	Yoshi2	i.e. first comes the data for the rows 0 2 4 6 8..., and then 1 3 5 7...
2016-02-02 20:37:20	@Espyo	I honestly cannot for the life of me understand interlacing
2016-02-02 20:40:09	Yoshi2	I can kinda understand it, but I am not sure why this format uses interlacing
2016-02-02 20:48:08	Yoshi2	the only thing I haven't figured out is the odd binary blob of data at the end of each file, but I hope that isn't important
2016-02-02 20:49:13	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-02 20:57:51	Yoshi2	in some level data I noticed bits of land far off to the edges of the map, so I'm pretty hyped about checking that out

2016-02-02 20:59:51	@Espyo	I HATE searching for stuff out-of-bounds in a game
2016-02-02 20:59:57	@Espyo	in an editor, I guess it's fine
2016-02-02 21:00:06	@Espyo	but in-game...I just have fear
2016-02-02 21:00:08	Yoshi2	I can fly a helicopter in this game, so it will be fine
2016-02-02 21:00:18	@Espyo	well, that'd make it a bit better
2016-02-02 21:00:36	@Espyo	but I just hate the feeling of going outside of the comfort zone that is the planned in-game area, and stepping out onto the land of undefined behavior
2016-02-02 21:00:55	@Espyo	if the game clears the image buffer, then all you get out of bounds is darkness
2016-02-02 21:00:59	@Espyo	pure nothingness
2016-02-02 21:01:10	@Espyo	and in the middle of that nothingness is a misplaced object
2016-02-02 21:01:13	Yoshi2	in theory, it should be fine in this game
2016-02-02 21:01:20	@Espyo	with a freaky debugging message
2016-02-02 21:01:23	@Espyo	it's like a bad nightmare
2016-02-02 21:01:36	@Espyo	if it doesn't clear the image buffer, it has a hall-of-mirror effect
2016-02-02 21:01:46	@Espyo	which is both like a fever dream and makes it harder to see stuff
2016-02-02 21:01:57	@Espyo	but yeah, if you can fly, and "everywhere" is sky, it's a bit better
2016-02-02 21:02:25	@Espyo	what I feel the worst is when the game just contains backstage stuff out of bounds
2016-02-02 21:02:31	@Espyo	not because it's hard to navigate amongst all of that
2016-02-02 21:02:37	@Espyo	but because it's always broken
2016-02-02 21:02:43	@Espyo	and ALWAYS manages to SCARE THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME
2016-02-02 21:02:52	@Espyo	I went out of bounds on Super Mario Galaxy with a flying cheat code
2016-02-02 21:03:12	Yoshi2	it is crazy how crazy the game always looks when you go out of bounds
2016-02-02 21:03:22	@Espyo	I got too close to the loading zone for the part of the level Mario is sent to when you enter one of those weird background "you're inside a box" type of sub-areas
2016-02-02 21:03:29	@Espyo	except that background is MASSIVE, and it just POPPED in instantly
2016-02-02 21:03:54	@Espyo	covering my entire view of the nothingness from being a plain space sky to a trippy nightmare in a single frame
2016-02-02 21:03:57	@Espyo	LIKE A SCREAMER
2016-02-02 21:04:18	@Espyo	I also remember going out of bounds in Portal
2016-02-02 21:04:23	@Espyo	what the hell was I even trying to do...?
2016-02-02 21:04:26	Yoshi2	heh, better than any horror game
2016-02-02 21:04:39	@Espyo	well, I know that while travelling the broken hall-of-mirrors and trying to understand where I was
2016-02-02 21:04:48	@Espyo	I stumbled upon a backstage trigger box
2016-02-02 21:04:51	@Espyo	that made a REALLY LOUD NOISE
2016-02-02 21:05:08	@Espyo	ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to go in a fetal position
2016-02-02 21:05:12	@Espyo	I'm not even a scaredy cat
2016-02-02 21:05:16	@Espyo	but going out of bounds?
2016-02-02 21:05:18	@Espyo	it's just VILE
2016-02-02 21:05:32	@Espyo	so it SUCKS that I'm so curious about oob and unused content
2016-02-02 21:06:35	Yoshi2	speaking of loud noises, I did something in dolphin and now one of my dolphin copies causes the pc to play beeping noises when specific stuff happens
2016-02-02 21:06:55	@Espyo	like, the native beeping noises?
2016-02-02 21:07:01	Yoshi2	might be the console that I enabled, but I am not sure
2016-02-02 21:07:13	@Espyo	yeah, if you try to print a certain character on the console, you get that
2016-02-02 21:07:24	@Espyo	 0x0A, if I had to rely on memory
2016-02-02 21:07:38	@Espyo	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character
2016-02-02 21:07:39	@Espyo	 0x07
2016-02-02 21:07:41	@Espyo	my next guess
2016-02-02 21:09:13	Yoshi2	probably
2016-02-02 21:09:25	Yoshi2	and oh wow, my change actually worked
2016-02-02 21:09:50	Yoshi2	green light for out of bounds traveling 
2016-02-02 21:09:51	@Espyo	oh nice

2016-02-02 21:13:09	Kidsy128	Espyo, what is your favorite pikmin?
2016-02-02 21:13:43	@Espyo	I never really think of it
2016-02-02 21:13:48	@Espyo	but probably Purples since they destroy EVERYTHING
2016-02-02 21:19:44	Yoshi2	ooops, I think the thing I changed also specified the paths the AI can move on
2016-02-02 21:21:14	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-02-02 21:21:17	@Espyo	let them walk off the cliff
2016-02-02 21:23:19	Yoshi2	they aren't moving
2016-02-02 21:23:21	Yoshi2	at all
2016-02-02 21:23:57	Yoshi2	makes capturing a base to receive helicopters more difficult, but ehhh, I can still control them manually so I guess it should work out

2016-02-02 22:00:15	Yoshi2	I managed to confirm one thing I had a theory about
2016-02-02 22:00:31	@Espyo	hm?
2016-02-02 22:00:51	Yoshi2	in one of the levels, the route you were supposed to take at the start was longer than it ended up being
2016-02-02 22:01:08	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-02 22:01:12	@Espyo	why did you suspect that at the start?
2016-02-02 22:01:27	@Espyo	because you saw the files, or because it's just the way stuff feels in-game?
2016-02-02 22:03:58	Yoshi2	I saw in the data I visualized and the full ingame map that there was a route in the out of bounds area
2016-02-02 22:04:57	@Espyo	ah
2016-02-02 22:04:59	@Espyo	good stuff
2016-02-02 22:07:13	Yoshi2	ugh imgur, stop failing when I actually need you
2016-02-02 22:10:20	Yoshi2	Espyo: so here is the terrain data for the level: https://i.imgur.com/QidIaQl.png (colors not necessarily representative of the materials they belong to) and here is the full ingame map: https://i.imgur.com/DPGz6Lj.png
2016-02-02 22:11:31	Yoshi2	red area in the ingame map is out of bounds, as far as the game is concerned
2016-02-02 22:11:51	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-02 22:13:53	Yoshi2	pretty distinctive snake-like path in the terrain data at the far bottom, green/black belongs to flat land while the yellow/brown area is hills
2016-02-02 22:17:20	@Espyo	right
2016-02-02 22:19:28	Yoshi2	the fun part is how all the terrain outside of bounds actually has collision
2016-02-02 22:19:38	@Espyo	yay
2016-02-02 22:20:02	Yoshi2	those devs have done a lot of stuff to make development easy
2016-02-02 22:28:03	Yoshi2	I checked out the other map with a piece of land in the corner
2016-02-02 22:33:48	Yoshi2	this smells a lot like an easter egg, but I need to confirm it
2016-02-02 22:35:09	@Espyo	oh, that'd just be amazing
2016-02-02 22:38:46	Testyo	that's the have what it takes to be somebody who can moderate the chatroom without problem
2016-02-02 22:40:02	Yoshi2	there is no regular way to get there, so the only way to see it is if there was a cutscene

2016-02-02 23:03:16	Yoshi2	nope, pretty sure there is no cutscene involving this place
2016-02-02 23:03:28	Yoshi2	although I should investigate if that place can be reached
2016-02-02 23:03:45	Yoshi2	in regular gameplay using secrets

2016-02-02 23:22:57	Yoshi2	maybe I will write a plotter for the unit positions before I go to bed

2016-02-03 19:59:56	ScruffyChat	Thank you so much!
2016-02-03 20:00:08	ScruffyChat	Was it called billy? Or did you name it that
2016-02-03 20:01:27	@Espyo	yep, it's its internal name
2016-02-03 20:01:35	@Espyo	[[Bearded Amprat]]
2016-02-03 20:01:36	Testyo	"Bearded_Amprat" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bearded_Amprat
2016-02-03 20:01:37	ScruffyChat	That's funny
2016-02-03 20:01:38	@Espyo	can't remember why that is
2016-02-03 20:01:41	@Espyo	it's a type of dog, I think?
2016-02-03 20:01:47	@Espyo	yeah, type of dog
2016-02-03 20:01:56	@Espyo	I have NO idea why
2016-02-03 20:02:05	@Espyo	but jisho.org suggests the billy dog
2016-02-03 20:03:13	ScruffyChat	The Amprat does appear to have a similar style of coat
2016-02-03 20:03:16	ScruffyChat	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_(dog)
2016-02-03 20:03:29	ScruffyChat	Shoot, that link's not going to work
2016-02-03 20:03:32	Yoshi2	woohoo, my video of the area I found in the game is done https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoIp5u_k_w0
2016-02-03 20:03:47	Yoshi2	but I just noticed you can speed the video up by 50% and it still wouldn't feel too fast
2016-02-03 20:05:20	@Espyo	works under HexChat
2016-02-03 20:05:46	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-03 20:06:27	Yoshi2	next time I will speed the video up by 50% myself in ffmpeg
2016-02-03 20:06:47	@Espyo	mhm
2016-02-03 20:06:59	Yoshi2	or I will try framedump + audiodump under linux
2016-02-03 20:07:04	ScruffyChat	Wow, cool!
2016-02-03 20:07:14	@Espyo	yeah, definitely try it
2016-02-03 20:07:27	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: you doing all right with its hairs?
2016-02-03 20:09:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the normal hair mesh is just one shape
2016-02-03 20:09:47	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-02-03 20:10:04	ScruffyChat	Interestingly the electrified hairs are part of the same object
2016-02-03 20:10:23	ScruffyChat	So even when the Amprat is calm, its excited hairs are present
2016-02-03 20:10:27	ScruffyChat	Somewhere
2016-02-03 20:10:30	@Espyo	neat
2016-02-03 20:10:35	@Espyo	I wish I had time to check how the Max script works
2016-02-03 20:10:48	@Espyo	so I could try to create an external script to convert into .3DS right away
2016-02-03 20:10:52	ScruffyChat	The electric hair mesh is crazy
2016-02-03 20:10:52	@Espyo	instead of going through the Max step
2016-02-03 20:11:11	ScruffyChat	They just kept adding more and more shapes
2016-02-03 20:11:18	@Espyo	heh
2016-02-03 20:11:29	UltraMario	misread as slopes
2016-02-03 20:11:31	UltraMario	:(
2016-02-03 20:11:38	 *	UltraMario pouts
2016-02-03 20:11:44	ScruffyChat	Of course they're all rectangles with hair textures, so you kind of need a lot to make it look like a full head of hair
2016-02-03 20:12:44	Yoshi2	Espyo: it really puzzles me how people write all those cool converter programs, but no docs on how the format actually works
2016-02-03 20:13:25	@Espyo	yep
2016-02-03 20:13:35	@Espyo	it makes sense
2016-02-03 20:13:47	@Espyo	"I've made a tool right here, so why bother? if you need to convert, use the tool and zip it"
2016-02-03 20:17:04	Yoshi2	those people obviously are smart enough to figure it out, so I am not sure why they don't go the extra step and make some docs about the format
2016-02-03 20:17:24	@Espyo	smart != not-lazy
2016-02-03 20:17:39	@Espyo	smart !=! lazy
2016-02-03 20:17:40	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-03 20:21:26	Yoshi2	!(smart <=> !lazy) 
2016-02-03 20:22:17	ScruffyChat	I just realized the Bearded Amprat has six front toes and /four/ back toes
2016-02-03 20:22:40	@Espyo	uhm
2016-02-03 20:22:42	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-03 20:22:45	@Espyo	is that normal in nature?
2016-02-03 20:22:52	@Espyo	I mean more the difference part
2016-02-03 20:22:59	@Espyo	not so much the 6 toes, although that TOO is pretty wtf
2016-02-03 20:24:03	ScruffyChat	No, I think most animals with toes have equal toes on all appendages
2016-02-03 20:24:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-03 20:24:42	@Espyo	I'd say it's a great thing to add to the trivia
2016-02-03 20:24:47	@Espyo	if we could get an image...
2016-02-03 20:25:04	@Espyo	but I'm not sure about using an image from a model editor
2016-02-03 20:25:09	ScruffyChat	Although it does have a paw on the back feet
2016-02-03 20:25:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that probably counts as fan imagery
2016-02-03 20:25:47	ScruffyChat	Since I'm not shading it within the game's shaders
2016-02-03 20:25:59	ScruffyChat	Or loading it within the game, for that matter
2016-02-03 20:26:10	Yoshi2	so !(smart <=> !lazy) is true for smart = 0, lazy = 1, and smart = 1, lazy = 0
2016-02-03 20:26:21	Yoshi2	... I am not sure what the meaning of that is
2016-02-03 20:27:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-03 20:27:47	ScruffyChat	It means they're both doomed to exponential procrastination and not doomed to productivity
2016-02-03 20:27:55	@Espyo	Yoshi2: it's a XOR
2016-02-03 20:28:37	ScruffyChat	It would be cool to have a gallery of orthographic pictures of Pikmin enemies
2016-02-03 20:28:45	Yoshi2	oOoOo, I made a xor

2016-02-03 23:29:42	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that and a batch of tests in my courses has kept me off the chat for a while
2016-02-03 23:29:49	ScruffyChat	But now both are finished
2016-02-03 23:31:58	@Espyo	Wikipedia has pseudocode for the A* algorithm
2016-02-03 23:32:08	@Espyo	but because I'm a real human, I tried searching for an already-made C++ implementation
2016-02-03 23:32:22	@Espyo	oh would you look at that, not a single human in the world ever created a C++ A* implementation
2016-02-03 23:32:33	@Espyo	you know, the most common path-finding algorithm on the most common programming language
2016-02-03 23:32:36	@Espyo	nope, not a single result on google
2016-02-03 23:32:50	@Espyo	there are a lot of results of crappy blog posts that talk about A* but don't show
2016-02-03 23:33:05	@Espyo	or implementations that are more like A-trash than A-star
2016-02-03 23:33:50	ScruffyChat	Man
2016-02-03 23:34:19	ScruffyChat	How ironic that the way to find a pathfinding algorithm is super convoluted
2016-02-03 23:34:43	ScruffyChat	brb
2016-02-03 23:35:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-03 23:35:57	ScruffyChat	back
2016-02-03 23:36:03	ScruffyChat	Oh Espyo, I should tell you
2016-02-03 23:36:26	ScruffyChat	I got this program called CrazyBump; it can produce normal textures from any image
2016-02-03 23:36:50	@Espyo	oh, nice!
2016-02-03 23:36:51	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure how it works, but Nintendo has probably been using something similar on all their Wii U gaems
2016-02-03 23:37:07	ScruffyChat	It also makes displacement, occlusion, and specular textures
2016-02-03 23:37:22	ScruffyChat	Which is great, if space-consuming
2016-02-03 23:37:28	@Espyo	isn't it possible to make a really really detailed model and then make a normal map out of that onto a flatter model?
2016-02-03 23:38:00	ScruffyChat	Yes. Actually you can do that without a really detailed model because no one wants to detail it
2016-02-03 23:38:09	ScruffyChat	You just need a bump map
2016-02-03 23:38:23	ScruffyChat	I've finally learned the difference between bump, normal, and displacementy
2016-02-03 23:38:28	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-03 23:38:29	ScruffyChat	displacement*
2016-02-03 23:38:55	ScruffyChat	Bump maps are the simplest, that give an image an illusion of depth using a simple lighting trick
2016-02-03 23:39:15	ScruffyChat	They're greyscale, with 50% gray representing 50% height
2016-02-03 23:39:26	ScruffyChat	And black is down and white is up
2016-02-03 23:39:53	ScruffyChat	If you put that on a model, you can bake it into a normal texture, though I don't know how exactly to do that
2016-02-03 23:40:03	ScruffyChat	A normal texture is more complex, it's in color
2016-02-03 23:40:53	ScruffyChat	And different colors represent different directions to imply with tangent mapping, so it's a 2D lighting trick rather than 1D
2016-02-03 23:41:25	ScruffyChat	And then you have displacement maps, which do not appear in video games because they require lots of polygons
2016-02-03 23:41:40	@Espyo	I'm guessing it indicates where the surface's normal is at any given point
2016-02-03 23:41:42	@Espyo	hence the name
2016-02-03 23:42:04	ScruffyChat	Displacement maps do not fake little bumps or normals on an object actually; they change the geometry of the object
2016-02-03 23:42:26	@Espyo	ooh
2016-02-03 23:42:37	ScruffyChat	So that the bumps created are real and react to light with entire accuracy
2016-02-03 23:43:35	ScruffyChat	That's why they require hi-poly models; although they try not to have too much detail they can still make a lower-poly model look very choppy
2016-02-03 23:44:15	ScruffyChat	So combining all three gives you the most realistic, most interesting materials
2016-02-03 23:44:53	ScruffyChat	And then I've been learning about specular maps, material masks, randomizing color
2016-02-03 23:45:05	ScruffyChat	And animated texturing
2016-02-03 23:45:14	ScruffyChat	And it all appears in Pikmin 3
2016-02-03 23:45:19	ScruffyChat	Well, not random color
2016-02-03 23:46:06	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-03 23:46:27	ScruffyChat	Thank you

2016-02-04 18:45:05	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-02-04 18:45:06	Testyo	because I guess last time I also started a batch file renamer
2016-02-04 18:48:20	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-04 18:50:02	Yoshi2	Espyo: I tried the frame dump+audio dump feature in dolphin, it was a success
2016-02-04 18:53:59	Yoshi2	with the newest-ish version of dolphin, all I had to do to sync both streams up is to take away a few seconds from the audio stream
2016-02-04 18:54:45	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-02-04 18:54:55	@Espyo	yeah, I knew it couldn't be THAT hard to sync
2016-02-04 18:57:09	Yoshi2	the older version I had on vista would've been a pain to sync because the video runs faster than the actual gameplay did

2016-02-04 19:10:32	Yoshi2	this time though, my video ended up being even bigger than last time and I'm only 50% done with a 130 min upload
2016-02-04 19:15:32	@Espyo	:/
2016-02-04 19:16:50	Yoshi2	I think my internet dying broke the upload...
2016-02-04 19:17:48	@Espyo	oh boy
2016-02-04 19:21:36	Yoshi2	ugh, I will reduce the bitrate of the video and then try again
2016-02-04 19:22:17	@Espyo	mhm
2016-02-04 19:22:22	@Espyo	 1500 to 2000 is a good value
2016-02-04 19:25:14	Yoshi2	that seems like streaming quality
2016-02-04 19:25:56	@J	everything depends on your codec and encoder
2016-02-04 19:26:04	@J	when streaming you'll do fast encoding
2016-02-04 19:30:43	Yoshi2	I'll do 4096 and see how it looks
2016-02-04 19:34:03	Yoshi2	seems indistinguishable from 8192 which I used before
2016-02-04 19:34:39	Yoshi2	trying 2000 now
2016-02-04 19:34:40	@Espyo	|:
2016-02-04 19:34:44	@Espyo	 8k?
2016-02-04 19:34:45	Testyo	8 K = -265.15 °C / -445.27 °F
2016-02-04 19:34:47	@Espyo	no wonder you didn't get anywhere
2016-02-04 19:34:57	@Espyo	I make my videos at 2k at most, and sure, you can TELL there's compression going on
2016-02-04 19:34:58	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -456.07 °F
2016-02-04 19:35:03	@Espyo	but honestly, it's not noticeable enough
2016-02-04 19:35:34	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avId9eRrEUc this was made with the aforementioned 1.5k - 2k
2016-02-04 19:35:35	Testyo	1.5 K = -271.65 °C / -456.97 °F
2016-02-04 19:35:39	@Espyo	and it looks good enough
2016-02-04 19:36:13	@Espyo	well, more or less
2016-02-04 19:36:17	@Espyo	but 8k is just overkill IMO
2016-02-04 19:36:17	Testyo	8 K = -265.15 °C / -445.27 °F
2016-02-04 19:37:15	Yoshi2	for the next video, I will likely reduce the internal resolution to 640x480 and use 2k or 4k as the bitrate
2016-02-04 19:37:16	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -456.07 °F
2016-02-04 19:37:51	Yoshi2	Espyo: what encoder would you use?
2016-02-04 19:38:02	@Espyo	uh, MP4
2016-02-04 19:38:05	@Espyo	I think
2016-02-04 19:38:52	@J	MP4 is a container format
2016-02-04 19:39:30	Yoshi2	mpeg4 is a video codec, or two video codecs
2016-02-04 19:39:43	Yoshi2	one of which is h264, I think
2016-02-04 19:39:54	@J	yeah, it has multiple parts
2016-02-04 19:40:05	@J	but if you just say MP4 you can't really say anything except the container
2016-02-04 19:40:14	@J	most stuff does use h264 and AAC in MP4 nowadays
2016-02-04 19:40:39	@J	but you get hugely varying results depending on the encoder and settings
2016-02-04 19:40:48	Yoshi2	indeed
2016-02-04 19:40:51	@J	I usually just use x264 with preset 'slow'
2016-02-04 19:41:02	@J	rather than a target bitrate
2016-02-04 19:41:55	@J	Espyo: but if it's a Wii game, he has much higher resolution
2016-02-04 19:41:59	@Espyo	I'm not a video guy
2016-02-04 19:42:04	@Espyo	I don't know what an encoder is
2016-02-04 19:42:07	@Espyo	I tried understanding once
2016-02-04 19:42:09	@Espyo	it wasn't fun
2016-02-04 19:42:22	@Espyo	wait, "AAC"
2016-02-04 19:42:23	@Espyo	that's familiar
2016-02-04 19:42:25	@Espyo	I think I used that
2016-02-04 19:42:46	@J	that's the audio
2016-02-04 19:43:09	@J	I guess audio won't contribute much here, but if it does just lower it to 96k or something
2016-02-04 19:43:10	Testyo	96 K = -177.15 °C / -286.87 °F
2016-02-04 19:43:47	Yoshi2	considering that halving the bitrate halved the video size, the audio doesn't do much
2016-02-04 19:43:59	@J	yeah
2016-02-04 19:44:11	Yoshi2	and I used vorbis for encoding the audio :|
2016-02-04 19:44:40	@J	Vorbis is just as good as AAC, but since you use a constant bitrate for audio usually anyway, you'll only notice a difference in quality, not size
2016-02-04 19:45:19	@J	not that I can ever really tell
2016-02-04 19:46:56	Yoshi2	hm, with 2k the video feels slightly more grainy
2016-02-04 19:46:56	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -456.07 °F
2016-02-04 19:48:42	Yoshi2	meh, I will upload the 2k one
2016-02-04 19:48:43	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -456.07 °F
2016-02-04 19:49:23	Yoshi2	my video is above the 480p resolution anyway so youtube will resize it, reducing grainy-ness a bit
2016-02-04 19:50:28	@J	if it's 720p, won't they provide a non-resized 720p version?
2016-02-04 19:50:42	Yoshi2	it's not 720p
2016-02-04 19:50:56	Yoshi2	960x540
2016-02-04 19:51:41	@J	hmm, I guess so
2016-02-04 19:51:55	@J	I think you can still retrieve the source if it's below 1080p though?
2016-02-04 19:52:05	@J	maybe that's a lie
2016-02-04 19:53:53	Yoshi2	no idea
2016-02-04 19:54:39	Yoshi2	definitely not with the regular youtube player
2016-02-04 19:56:00	Yoshi2	30 minutes upload now
2016-02-04 19:59:58	Yoshi2	I remember using a GUI program for encoding video/audio ages ago that was built on top of ffmpeg, and now I'm pretty sure ffmpeg is easier to use than that GUI program

2016-02-04 20:45:23	@Espyo	tonight I had a nice idea for the wiki while sleeping
2016-02-04 20:45:28	@Espyo	[[Pikipedia:Spoiler policy]]
2016-02-04 20:45:29	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Spoiler_policy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Spoiler_policy
2016-02-04 20:45:39	@Espyo	TL;DR: we should minimize spoiler warnings
2016-02-04 20:45:48	@Espyo	only really warn about the big things, like Louie's Dark Secret
2016-02-04 20:45:52	Yoshi2	did you dream of policies while sleeping?
2016-02-04 20:45:52	@Espyo	but then I thought
2016-02-04 20:46:01	@Espyo	no, that policy exists for a few months now
2016-02-04 20:46:07	@Espyo	plus it was while trying to sleep
2016-02-04 20:46:16	@Espyo	I DO sometimes dream of good ideas for this and that, though
2016-02-04 20:46:20	@Espyo	good stuff
2016-02-04 20:46:27	@Espyo	anyway, then I thought
2016-02-04 20:46:32	@Espyo	what about Pikmin 4?
2016-02-04 20:46:38	@Espyo	should we only write spoiler warnings for the big things?
2016-02-04 20:47:01	@Espyo	for the first few months, people will be looking at a few pages
2016-02-04 20:47:08	@Espyo	and might stumble upon spoilers, without knowing whatsoever
2016-02-04 20:47:13	@Espyo	like, the plain old Red Bulborb page
2016-02-04 20:47:20	@Espyo	what if it had a section explaining how it's the final boss of the game?
2016-02-04 20:47:27	@Espyo	a sentient Red Bulborb or something
2016-02-04 20:47:37	@Espyo	or not a final boss, but a mid-boss
2016-02-04 20:47:48	@Espyo	I figured: as per our policy, we shouldn't put a spoiler warning
2016-02-04 20:47:50	@Espyo	buuuuuuuut
2016-02-04 20:47:55	@Espyo	what if we opened an exception for new games?
2016-02-04 20:48:25	@Espyo	for the first 6 months, any information that's mid-to-late game-related and major spoilers get a special warning box
2016-02-04 20:48:38	@Espyo	something about how there are spoilers ahead for the recently-released game
2016-02-04 20:48:55	@Espyo	that way, old content will still be like normal
2016-02-04 20:49:05	@Espyo	and new stuff that could spoil a whole new game for people will receive a warning
2016-02-04 20:49:25	@Espyo	and by using a new template for it, we can just wait till 6 months pass and check all pages where the template is used to remove them
2016-02-04 20:49:35	@Espyo	(or upgrade them to a normal spoiler warning, if needed)
2016-02-04 20:49:37	@Espyo	how's that sound?
2016-02-04 21:09:23	Yoshi2	so a spoiler things for the first 6 months that is removed later?
2016-02-04 21:09:30	Yoshi2	sounds like a neat idea

2016-02-04 22:05:32	@Espyo	so this might be just right
2016-02-04 22:06:11	Yoshi2	I will check a LP of this game

2016-02-04 22:13:00	Yoshi2	Espyo: yup, it's definitely supposed to go faster
2016-02-04 22:13:07	Yoshi2	https://youtu.be/V9UisPwk4AE?t=2m44s
2016-02-04 22:13:11	@Espyo	oh well
2016-02-04 22:13:17	@Espyo	so wait, you didn't know this? you never played the game?
2016-02-04 22:14:18	Yoshi2	I did play it on my wii a longer while ago, but since then I've been playing it on the pc and I forgot how smoothly it is actually supposed to go
2016-02-04 22:15:04	Yoshi2	but I did feel that my recording was still a bit slow
2016-02-04 22:15:41	Yoshi2	need to investigate that next time
2016-02-04 22:15:59	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-02-04 22:16:52	Yoshi2	I need to check the fps next time
2016-02-04 22:17:53	Yoshi2	I have a theory though, maybe my game runs at 30 fps when it should be 60 fps
2016-02-04 22:18:24	Yoshi2	dolphin reports 30 fps / 60 vps (or something like that)
2016-02-04 22:18:41	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-02-04 22:18:52	Yoshi2	no idea how to fix that, it would basically be the game's frame limiter kicking in and messing everything up
2016-02-04 22:19:05	Yoshi2	had something similar in super mario galaxy
2016-02-04 22:19:10	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is any fix for that

2016-02-05 19:33:00	Klemen702	(to whoever is reading this) do me a favor, google ''mountain chicken'' and tell me if you think that is a chicken or not.
2016-02-05 19:44:23	Yoshi2	Klemen702: looks like a frog
2016-02-05 19:45:31	Klemen702	nah
2016-02-05 19:45:33	Klemen702	it's tots a chicken
2016-02-05 19:45:40	Yoshi2	can't argue with that
2016-02-05 19:46:38	Yoshi2	Espyo: today I investigated the framerate thing a bit, apparently the recording I uploaded on youtube was actually 25 fps
2016-02-05 19:46:56	Yoshi2	so not even 30 fps
2016-02-05 19:47:31	Yoshi2	I will try the ntsc version and see if that one produces footage with better fps
2016-02-05 19:51:03	@J	it's actually working with Discord now, I think
2016-02-05 19:51:07	@J	do I show up as online?

2016-02-05 20:12:25	@Espyo	yeah, try tinkering with the fps
2016-02-05 20:34:04	Yoshi2	hmmm, using the ntsc version doesn't seem to make much difference
2016-02-05 20:36:00	Yoshi2	ok, I think ffmpeg's/avconv's default mode of encoding is 25 fps if I don't specify it

2016-02-05 20:55:55	@PikFan	hey Espyo, the polls you make last forever, right?
2016-02-05 20:56:06	@PikFan	also hi
2016-02-05 20:56:22	Yoshi2	ok, so here is a fun fact about dolphin's framedump:
2016-02-05 20:56:40	Yoshi2	disabling dualcore actually improves the framerate/smoothness of the recording
2016-02-05 20:57:47	Yoshi2	I have the recording with dual core and the one without dual core side by side, and the one without is clearly much more smooth
2016-02-05 20:58:22	Scruffy	Interestin
2016-02-05 20:58:24	Scruffy	g
2016-02-05 20:58:29	@PikFan	nice
2016-02-05 20:59:29	Yoshi2	but dolphin is so much slower without dual core enabled :/

2016-02-05 21:01:21	@PikFan	sweet
2016-02-05 21:01:33	Scruffy	Which means little bumps on objects will look better and make the materials more interesting

2016-02-05 21:11:38	Scruffy	Yeah, age is just the number of times you've gone around the Sun
2016-02-05 21:11:43	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-05 21:11:54	@PikFan	that was kinda mindblowing for me
2016-02-05 21:12:17	@PikFan	but Espyo, age is only a number till you start getting wrinkles and such
2016-02-05 21:12:30	Scruffy	Wait, just now? Or did you already know that?
2016-02-05 21:12:34	@PikFan	but you probably know that
2016-02-05 21:12:44	@PikFan	Scruffy: I already knew that
2016-02-05 21:12:45	@Espyo	oh man, that Garden of Hope render <3
2016-02-05 21:12:52	Scruffy	hehe thank you
2016-02-05 21:12:52	@PikFan	I knowwww
2016-02-05 21:12:58	@Espyo	yeah, but by that point, it's more like your cells dying on you
2016-02-05 21:13:01	@Espyo	still not so much the number
2016-02-05 21:13:10	Neocraftz1553	I like the Formidable oak render
2016-02-05 21:13:18	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-02-05 21:13:58	Yoshi2	I know a guy who is somewhere between 25 and 30 years old, and as far as I am concerned, he is anything but old
2016-02-05 21:14:23	Neocraftz1553	Befor P3, I thought the Electric hazard was going to be remade into something undestroyable, kinda like in the Formidable Oak one
2016-02-05 21:14:30	Neocraftz1553	*Before
2016-02-05 21:15:02	Scruffy	Oh heh, yeah I just realized the hazard I made there is kinda indestructible :P

2016-02-05 21:15:36	Scruffy	I just chose a loose wire over the frayed wire tips because the wire itself is easier to model
2016-02-05 21:15:56	Scruffy	As is the electric arc

2016-02-05 21:19:17	Scruffy	Very well done Neo!
2016-02-05 21:19:22	Neocraftz1553	whats your channel Yoshi2
2016-02-05 21:19:27	@Espyo	I honestly wouldn't mind shaky framerate, as long as it didn't slowly drag on
2016-02-05 21:19:28	Neocraftz1553	Thank you, Scruffy
2016-02-05 21:19:35	@Espyo	but it's REALLY weird that it has such a variable framerate
2016-02-05 21:19:47	Scruffy	How did you make that tree in the background of the second one?
2016-02-05 21:19:48	@Espyo	the frame dump feature should dump every frame the game renders
2016-02-05 21:19:51	@Espyo	regardless of playback speed
2016-02-05 21:20:03	@Espyo	you could pause emulation, step to the next frame in an hour, and it'd just put it on the video file then
2016-02-05 21:20:04	@Espyo	so...
2016-02-05 21:20:05	Neocraftz1553	theres a tree in the background of both of em

2016-02-05 21:20:14	Scruffy	Ah I see
2016-02-05 21:20:16	@PikFan	nice, I like the Blue Pikmin
2016-02-05 21:20:34	@Espyo	not bad, Neo
2016-02-05 21:20:37	Neocraftz1553	Use a cone and then make it larger on the z axis
2016-02-05 21:20:50	Scruffy	Ah
2016-02-05 21:20:59	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-02-05 21:21:03	Neocraftz1553	It looks pretty ugly when not rendered
2016-02-05 21:21:19	Scruffy	That's okay
2016-02-05 21:21:29	Scruffy	You've UV mapped it then?
2016-02-05 21:21:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I think
2016-02-05 21:21:49	Scruffy	Cool
2016-02-05 21:22:00	Scruffy	It's well mapped
2016-02-05 21:22:25	Neocraftz1553	I am trying to rip models from P1 and P2
2016-02-05 21:22:40	Scruffy	Honestly, I had to retouch the Formidable Oak place a little in a sketchbook application because I couldn't get the UV map to look right
2016-02-05 21:22:53	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-05 21:23:07	Neocraftz1553	I just roughly form its shape and hope for the best

2016-02-05 21:24:26	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-05 21:25:07	Neocraftz1553	you have no videos on your channel Yoshi2?

2016-02-05 21:26:21	Neocraftz1553	I might make a Desert area similer to the one you made, Scruffy, or an area of Tropical Wilds...
2016-02-05 21:26:31	Yoshi2	well, the channel page itself isn't set up
2016-02-05 21:26:33	Neocraftz1553	which one should I make?

2016-02-05 21:31:22	Neocraftz1553	hey scruffy, how did you make the onions in your renders?
2016-02-05 21:33:58	Scruffy	I use a model I made from scratch
2016-02-05 21:34:05	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-02-05 21:34:13	Neocraftz1553	I am going to try to model one
2016-02-05 21:34:13	Scruffy	And then design some materials for it
2016-02-05 21:34:23	Scruffy	It kinda looks different for me every time
2016-02-05 21:34:29	Neocraftz1553	did you model the Winged and Rock Pikmin as well
2016-02-05 21:35:12	Neocraftz1553	yeah, the onions do seem to look different every time...
2016-02-05 21:35:51	Scruffy	No, I used the actual Pikmin 3 models
2016-02-05 21:36:05	Neocraftz1553	in the first day tutorial video, the "legs" looked super-thin to me, but in the Yellow Onion render, the onion looks... different... almost like in P3
2016-02-05 21:36:05	Scruffy	I apologize, I'm lazy and not very proficient at modelling
2016-02-05 21:36:09	Neocraftz1553	woah
2016-02-05 21:36:17	Neocraftz1553	how did you get the models?
2016-02-05 21:36:22	Scruffy	Espyo has them
2016-02-05 21:36:29	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-02-05 21:36:33	Scruffy	oh, yeah
2016-02-05 21:36:35	Neocraftz1553	I'm kinda afraid to ask
2016-02-05 21:36:48	Scruffy	the Onion "legs" in Pikmin Forever are roots
2016-02-05 21:36:50	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-05 21:36:54	Scruffy	That's why they're kinda thin
2016-02-05 21:36:57	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-02-05 21:37:02	Neocraftz1553	ok, that explains it
2016-02-05 21:37:09	Scruffy	But Pikminfan27 probably didn't want that, so I changed their thickness
2016-02-05 21:37:21	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-05 21:37:37	Neocraftz1553	he probably wanted them like in P3
2016-02-05 21:38:05	Neocraftz1553	your renders never cease to amaze me
2016-02-05 21:39:06	Scruffy	Heh, thankyou

2016-02-05 21:39:17	Scruffy	I'm no where near what some people can do with Blender though
2016-02-05 21:39:20	Scruffy	It's insane

2016-02-05 22:30:40	@PikFan	you're closer than I thought, heh
2016-02-05 22:30:58	@PikFan	I thought you lived on the east coast, too
2016-02-05 22:30:58	En_Passant	You're in Oregon, aren't you?
2016-02-05 22:31:07	@PikFan	correct
2016-02-05 22:31:34	En_Passant	That's still pretty far
2016-02-05 22:31:40	En_Passant	As far as driving goes, at least
2016-02-05 22:31:40	Scruffy	Neocraftz1553: YellowChappy is a Hairy Bulbobr
2016-02-05 22:31:46	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-05 22:32:00	Scruffy	It was planned to be yellow, and Orange to be blue, but they changed it
2016-02-05 22:32:24	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-02-05 22:32:30	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see
2016-02-05 22:32:44	En_Passant	They decided to be more original
2016-02-05 22:32:59	Neocraftz1553	so a hairy bulborb does technically exist in P1?
2016-02-05 22:34:24	Scruffy	No, they didn't create it until Pikmin 2 came along
2016-02-05 22:35:15	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-02-05 22:35:27	Neocraftz1553	I need to learn how to rip models...

2016-02-05 22:35:49	Neocraftz1553	If I ever learned how to, I would rip almost all the models from P1 and P2
2016-02-05 22:36:37	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/player.zip leaders and Pikmin (they're also all bundled together)
2016-02-05 22:37:21	Scruffy	Oh yeah, that's great
2016-02-05 22:37:27	Scruffy	It even has Pikpik Carrots
2016-02-05 22:41:00	@Espyo	yep
2016-02-05 22:41:15	@Espyo	now to find the Onion
2016-02-05 22:43:11	Neocraftz1553	ok, thank you very much
2016-02-05 22:43:51	@Espyo	it's not on my notes...
2016-02-05 22:43:56	@Espyo	I wrote notes about what objects are what
2016-02-05 22:44:07	@Espyo	and I don't have the Onion pointed donw
2016-02-05 22:44:09	@Espyo	*down
2016-02-05 22:44:53	Neocraftz1553	hmm... Its ok, you don't have to get it
2016-02-05 22:46:42	En_Passant	someone's speedrunning All Treasures if you guys want to watch
2016-02-05 22:51:02	Scruffy	Where? Is it live?

2016-02-05 22:58:00	Scruffy	How many Pikmin would you guys like non-queen-Candypop Buds to change in Pikmin 2:Up Late
2016-02-05 22:58:08	Scruffy	I've tried 5 and I've tried 10

2016-02-05 23:00:11	En_Passant	Maybe 10, if you plan on making them super scarce
2016-02-05 23:00:44	En_Passant	Do you have any plans for the Doomsday Apparatus?
2016-02-05 23:02:28	Scruffy	After all the devious tricks I'm gonna play, I planned on making it weigh 1
2016-02-05 23:02:50	@PikFan	hah
2016-02-05 23:05:45	Scruffy	This speedrun is intense

2016-02-05 23:08:07	En_Passant	I can't decide if I should pay the extra $1 to get DLC for Smash Wii U
2016-02-05 23:08:07	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.9197 € / £ 0.6499 
2016-02-05 23:08:19	En_Passant	I have a Wii U, but no Smash on it
2016-02-05 23:08:26	En_Passant	I don't know if I want to get it because I have 3DS already
2016-02-05 23:08:44	En_Passant	But if I do decide to get it, it would save me a few dollars
2016-02-05 23:14:05	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo, I figured out that writing $ before an enemy name in a cave makes it appear from the sky
2016-02-05 23:14:29	Scruffy	Obviously doesn't work with things that are always on the ground (i.e. hazards) or things that already fall from the sky
2016-02-05 23:14:36	@Espyo	oh
2016-02-05 23:14:39	@Espyo	yeah, I...
2016-02-05 23:14:43	@Espyo	reached that conclusion before
2016-02-05 23:14:46	@Espyo	sorry :/
2016-02-05 23:14:48	@Espyo	but the thing is
2016-02-05 23:14:49	Scruffy	Oh heh
2016-02-05 23:14:51	Scruffy	that's okay
2016-02-05 23:14:54	@Espyo	that's pretty much the ONLY conclusion I can get
2016-02-05 23:15:01	@Espyo	because NOTHING ELSE makes sense
2016-02-05 23:15:09	@Espyo	if you can figure out the rest, that'd be awesome
2016-02-05 23:15:10	Scruffy	yeah
2016-02-05 23:15:17	@Espyo	actually, I also figured out some IDs
2016-02-05 23:15:22	@Espyo	uh... where did I put this again...
2016-02-05 23:15:36	Scruffy	Oh yeah!
2016-02-05 23:16:00	Scruffy	I should probably write down the serial number for enemies in overworld areas
2016-02-05 23:16:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-05 23:16:12	@Espyo	on the shared folder thingie, to
2016-02-05 23:16:15	@Espyo	*too
2016-02-05 23:19:26	@Espyo	>Anything starting with a $ is something that falls from the sky.
2016-02-05 23:19:29	@Espyo	from my notes
2016-02-05 23:19:32	@PikFan	holy crap
2016-02-05 23:19:33	@Espyo	but I can't find the list of IDs!
2016-02-05 23:19:36	@Espyo	I can't remember what the IDs ARE
2016-02-05 23:19:42	@PikFan	just got 16 kills in rainmaker
2016-02-05 23:19:53	@Espyo	but I distinctly remember that id #2 and id #0 cause an error
2016-02-05 23:19:56	@Espyo	which the game handles by
2016-02-05 23:19:56	@Espyo	...
2016-02-05 23:19:57	@PikFan	that's really good for me
2016-02-05 23:19:59	@Espyo	spawning a glowcap
2016-02-05 23:20:02	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-05 23:20:05	@Espyo	but remember, kills aren't all
2016-02-05 23:20:13	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2016-02-05 23:20:27	@PikFan	but I'm just impressed with how offensive I was in that battle
2016-02-05 23:22:51	@Espyo	gaaah
2016-02-05 23:22:56	@Espyo	I KNOW I pointed it down somewhere
2016-02-05 23:23:06	@Espyo	meanwhile, I can't find the model for the Onion in P3
2016-02-05 23:23:33	Scruffy	Heh, Neo isn't even here anymore
2016-02-05 23:25:55	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-02-05 23:26:07	@PikFan	last night I had my first encounter with S ranked people
2016-02-05 23:26:13	@PikFan	and I actually won the match
2016-02-05 23:26:24	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-05 23:26:29	@PikFan	but after the match I immediately got out of there
2016-02-05 23:27:35	@Espyo	ugh
2016-02-05 23:27:38	@Espyo	so simple
2016-02-05 23:27:43	@Espyo	it's on the P2 TCRF page
2016-02-05 23:27:59	@Espyo	oh, hang on
2016-02-05 23:28:10	@Espyo	There are 7 behaviors for the objects that fall from cave ceilings. 2 of these are not used in the final game.
2016-02-05 23:28:10	@Espyo	    $3 makes it so that the object only falls if a leader is nearby; Pikmin are ignored.
2016-02-05 23:28:10	@Espyo	    $0 transforms the entire object into a fully-functional Common Glowcap... for some reason.
2016-02-05 23:28:11	Testyo	$ 3 = 2.7591 € / £ 1.9497 
2016-02-05 23:28:11	Testyo	$ 0 = 0 € / £ 0 
2016-02-05 23:28:20	@Espyo	https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2#Misc.
2016-02-05 23:28:22	@Espyo	so it's not a full list
2016-02-05 23:28:25	@Espyo	just of the unused ones
2016-02-05 23:29:46	Scruffy	So they actually type "$3"? Or $$$
2016-02-05 23:29:53	Scruffy	I haven't seen either of those yet
2016-02-05 23:31:50	@Espyo	$3
2016-02-05 23:31:50	Testyo	$ 3 = 2.7591 € / £ 1.9497 
2016-02-05 23:32:02	@Espyo	there's code for the objects to spawn if Pikmin get near, but not leaders
2016-02-05 23:32:06	@Espyo	leaders get near, but not Pikmin
2016-02-05 23:32:09	@Espyo	$ is just spawning from the sky
2016-02-05 23:32:15	@Espyo	there's code for spawning only if Pikmin are carrying
2016-02-05 23:32:21	@Espyo	I must've deleted that list...
2016-02-05 23:32:27	@Espyo	but it wasn't that hard to come up with...
2016-02-05 23:32:38	@Espyo	if you can come up with it again, put it on the docs, will you?
2016-02-05 23:32:40	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-02-05 23:32:42	Scruffy	In the overworld areas, you don't even need the $
2016-02-05 23:32:45	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-05 23:32:48	@Espyo	how so?
2016-02-05 23:32:54	@Espyo	well, I never looked at the overworld files
2016-02-05 23:32:57	@Espyo	not with detail at least
2016-02-05 23:33:12	@Espyo	but still, spawning in the overworld isn't really flexible like in caves
2016-02-05 23:33:16	Scruffy	Each enemy generator has a parameter called "teki_birth_type"
2016-02-05 23:33:23	@Espyo	oh?
2016-02-05 23:33:32	Scruffy	0 is just appearing
2016-02-05 23:33:42	Scruffy	1 falls from the sky, but I don't know the triggeres
2016-02-05 23:33:56	Scruffy	and so o
2016-02-05 23:33:58	Scruffy	on*
2016-02-05 23:34:09	@Espyo	neat
2016-02-05 23:34:33	En_Passant	lol, we're discussing Pikmni 2 hacking in the speedrun chat
2016-02-05 23:36:18	Scruffy	I couldn't imagine making a tool for hacking it
2016-02-05 23:36:28	Scruffy	I can describe what to do, probably inefficiently
2016-02-05 23:40:21	@Espyo	speedrun chat?
2016-02-05 23:40:46	@Espyo	when did tools come into the conversation?
2016-02-05 23:40:49	@Espyo	I'm super lost right now
2016-02-05 23:40:51	@Espyo	also kinda tired
2016-02-05 23:40:59	@Espyo	and I've been watching Undertale videos nonstop for the past 3 hours
2016-02-05 23:43:09	En_Passant	http://www.twitch.tv/Mcat55
2016-02-05 23:43:23	En_Passant	They mentioned tools in the chat
2016-02-05 23:45:49	@PikFan	wait Espyo
2016-02-05 23:45:58	@PikFan	are you starting to get into Undertale now
2016-02-05 23:46:01	@Espyo	I see
2016-02-05 23:46:07	@Espyo	I followed the Game Grumps play it
2016-02-05 23:46:16	@Espyo	I actually played the original demo waaaaay back when it was still early alpha
2016-02-05 23:46:22	@Espyo	found it neat, but forgot about it since
2016-02-05 23:46:40	@Espyo	when it started becoming a big thing, I wanted to join on the fun, but didn't really have the time to play
2016-02-05 23:46:45	@Espyo	luckily the Grumps picked it up
2016-02-05 23:46:51	@Espyo	REALLY wish I'd have played
2016-02-05 23:46:51	@PikFan	you probably heard already, but Toby Fox wants to port it to the Wii U
2016-02-05 23:46:52	@Espyo	but time
2016-02-05 23:46:54	@Espyo	(and money)
2016-02-05 23:47:00	@Espyo	uhm, I think I heard something like that
2016-02-05 23:48:06	@PikFan	not sure if I told you already, but one time I was reading a Pikmin 2 story out loud to my friends at school
2016-02-05 23:48:29	@PikFan	because I was describing the subterranean environment, they were like "This sounds like Undertale..."
2016-02-05 23:49:21	@Espyo	pfft
2016-02-05 23:51:05	@PikFan	what?
2016-02-05 23:51:16	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-02-05 23:51:30	@PikFan	unfortunately, these friends don't really care about Pikmin...
2016-02-05 23:51:38	@PikFan	nor does anyone at my school, really
2016-02-05 23:52:08	@Espyo	that really weird comparison
2016-02-05 23:52:09	@PikFan	which is really sad because Pikmin's a unique and interesting game
2016-02-05 23:52:11	@Espyo	made me laugh, is all
2016-02-05 23:52:19	@Espyo	yeah, but that's just how it is...
2016-02-05 23:52:35	Scruffy	brb
2016-02-05 23:52:42	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-02-05 23:52:48	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-02-05 23:53:14	@PikFan	I really thought that because I'm in a bigger school, there'd at least be someone else who enjoys Pikmin
2016-02-05 23:53:17	@PikFan	but NOPE
2016-02-05 23:53:23	@PikFan	they refuse to give it a chance
2016-02-05 23:53:45	@PikFan	they're too busy talking about their own interests
2016-02-05 23:53:52	@PikFan	namely, Homestuck
2016-02-05 23:53:59	@PikFan	almost always Homestuck
2016-02-05 23:55:12	@PikFan	sorry, I don
2016-02-05 23:55:20	@PikFan	*don't mean to gripe about my problems
2016-02-05 23:55:53	@PikFan	I really hope we get P4 info soon...
2016-02-05 23:56:10	@PikFan	if it's really almost complete, I'm looking at either a summer launch or a holiday launch
2016-02-05 23:56:24	@PikFan	Nintendo's been weird lately
2016-02-05 23:56:33	@PikFan	they hardly give any news on their upcoming projects
2016-02-05 23:56:39	@PikFan	like Zelda
2016-02-05 23:56:52	@PikFan	what did Zelda do to deserve this lack of attention
2016-02-05 23:57:08	@PikFan	it's not building hype, it's driving it away
2016-02-05 23:57:28	@PikFan	I think Skyward Sword got more news than this
2016-02-05 23:57:43	@PikFan	not even a proper trailer...
2016-02-05 23:57:47	@PikFan	or even a name
2016-02-05 23:58:07	@PikFan	just... what exactly is going on with Nintendo? they're making poor choices
2016-02-05 23:58:36	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-02-05 23:59:07	@PikFan	well, they'd better talk about Zelda at E3
2016-02-05 23:59:20	@PikFan	if not, then I'm losing all hope
2016-02-06 00:00:30	Scruffy	back
2016-02-06 00:00:54	@PikFan	hi
2016-02-06 00:01:21	Scruffy	When I left, this guy was halfway through the Citadel of Spiders
2016-02-06 00:01:55	Scruffy	I was gone not 10 minutes, and I find him taking the out-of-bounds backwards route to the shower Room with all above-ground treasures collected
2016-02-06 00:02:48	Scruffy	This is insane
2016-02-06 00:03:02	@PikFan	wow
2016-02-06 00:03:59	@Espyo	...
2016-02-06 00:03:59	@Espyo	...
2016-02-06 00:04:00	@Espyo	...
2016-02-06 00:04:07	@PikFan	?
2016-02-06 00:04:08	@Espyo	I clicked on an external link on a wikia page
2016-02-06 00:04:09	@Espyo	...
2016-02-06 00:04:18	@Espyo	it showed a notification saying how this link will take me to an external site
2016-02-06 00:04:22	@Espyo	and plastered an ad on the warning
2016-02-06 00:04:32	@Espyo	aren't the trillions of page ads enough?
2016-02-06 00:04:44	@Espyo	isn't the massive background that peeks through the sides of the page enough?
2016-02-06 00:04:52	@Espyo	must they cram an ad in every pixel of the screen?
2016-02-06 00:04:53	@PikFan	I've noticed that there's been ads in the BODIES of articles
2016-02-06 00:04:58	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-06 00:04:59	@PikFan	like news websites
2016-02-06 00:05:03	@Espyo	it's like — yeah
2016-02-06 00:05:12	@PikFan	that's taking it too far
2016-02-06 00:05:21	@PikFan	I mean, they've already taken it too far
2016-02-06 00:05:23	@Espyo	not far enough for me
2016-02-06 00:05:28	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-06 00:05:37	@PikFan	well, what's too far for you?

2016-02-06 00:05:53	@Espyo	I'm really not untired enough to think of a comparison

2016-02-06 00:06:03	Scruffy	A safe?

2016-02-06 00:06:19	@Espyo	I guess a safe, but it's too obvious
2016-02-06 00:06:47	@PikFan	wikia's ads slow down my computer so much
2016-02-06 00:07:15	@PikFan	I always have to use monobook or else things start freezing up and it takes ages to exit out

2016-02-06 00:07:35	En_Passant	Are there any good alternatives to Wikia?
2016-02-06 00:07:56	@PikFan	I know there's shoutwiki
2016-02-06 00:08:05	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-06 00:08:10	@Espyo	other than that, indie wikis, honestly
2016-02-06 00:08:12	@Espyo	not quite sure of anything else
2016-02-06 00:08:26	@PikFan	and then, of course, Wikipedia
2016-02-06 00:08:35	Scruffy	Wikispaces is one

2016-02-06 00:10:33	@PikFan	dang
2016-02-06 00:20:14	Scruffy	All right, time to mod some Pikmin
2016-02-06 00:20:32	@PikFan	yay
2016-02-06 00:34:34	En_Passant	I still don't know about Smash
2016-02-06 00:37:08	Scruffy	So, if you buy Wii U DLC, you save a few dollars even though you don't have Wii U Smash?
2016-02-06 00:38:40	En_Passant	I have 3DS
2016-02-06 00:38:51	En_Passant	It costs a dollar more to get for both than for a single version
2016-02-06 00:39:49	En_Passant	I'd save the cost of each DLC I get after this (which is only a couple of items) minus a dollar each if I decide to get Smash Wii U later
2016-02-06 00:41:14	En_Passant	I think
2016-02-06 00:41:22	En_Passant	It's a dollar for characters, at least
2016-02-06 00:41:43	En_Passant	40 cents for each Mii costume
2016-02-06 00:46:23	Scruffy	I think I would get it for both of them
2016-02-06 00:46:29	Scruffy	Wii U Smash is really cool
2016-02-06 00:48:53	Scruffy	Oh, by the way En_Passant, I don't know if I told you
2016-02-06 00:49:02	Scruffy	But I got fire geysers to be invincible in Pikmin 3
2016-02-06 00:49:06	Scruffy	PIkmin 2*
2016-02-06 00:49:22	En_Passant	Actually invincible?
2016-02-06 00:49:32	Scruffy	yep
2016-02-06 00:49:34	En_Passant	Or just with 990,000,000,000 health?
2016-02-06 00:49:42	Scruffy	I set it to the highest possible value it could have
2016-02-06 00:49:54	Scruffy	which was like 99999999999 or something
2016-02-06 00:50:15	Scruffy	And after a solid hour of full-army spicy Red Pikmin bombardment
2016-02-06 00:50:24	Scruffy	The health wheel didn't even show up
2016-02-06 00:50:41	Scruffy	with 99900000000 health the wheel did show up after a couple seconds or so
2016-02-06 00:53:45	@PikFan	woah
2016-02-06 00:55:36	@PikFan	wait, why did the health wheel show up a few seconds for 99,900,000,000 health, but not even a whole hour for 99,999,999,999?
2016-02-06 00:55:51	@PikFan	I mean, that's only a difference of 100 million
2016-02-06 00:56:07	@PikFan	that seems a bit off
2016-02-06 00:56:39	Scruffy	Well, I don't know how many 9's it was
2016-02-06 00:56:40	En_Passant	I think that was an estimate
2016-02-06 00:56:46	Scruffy	But it was the maximum possible value
2016-02-06 00:56:51	Scruffy	So I think the game gives up
2016-02-06 00:57:14	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-06 00:57:30	Scruffy	It can't estimate a Pikmin damage fraction small enough
2016-02-06 00:58:14	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-06 00:59:33	Scruffy	Although i still need to try it with Purple Pikmin smashes though
2016-02-06 01:01:16	 *	@PikFan sees Purple Pikmin running around on fire
2016-02-06 01:03:01	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 01:11:40	Scruffy	How is he recording GameCube footage?
2016-02-06 01:12:21	En_Passant	uh
2016-02-06 01:12:52	En_Passant	Dunno, but it can't be too hard because people stream Gamecube games all the time
2016-02-06 01:14:35	@PikFan	I'd love some recording equipment
2016-02-06 01:15:30	@PikFan	I know there's one that can record on GameCube, Wii, and Wii U (as well as many other consoles) but it costs like $150 or something around there
2016-02-06 01:16:01	@PikFan	...I could also show you the pain I go through in Splatoon
2016-02-06 01:18:18	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-06 01:18:45	@PikFan	well, at least I have a YouTube channel

2016-02-06 01:40:07	Scruffy	That's okay
2016-02-06 01:40:46	Scruffy	I'm just watching this guy conquer the Wistful Wild like it's the first day or something
2016-02-06 01:42:52	En_Passant	lol
2016-02-06 01:43:16	@PikFan	the same guy? wow
2016-02-06 01:43:22	Scruffy	Seriously I didn't know the game could be exploited so heavily
2016-02-06 01:43:32	Scruffy	I've never watched a Pikmin 2 speedrun before
2016-02-06 01:43:44	@PikFan	ah
2016-02-06 01:44:13	@PikFan	heh, when you finish Up Late, somebody will have to speedrun that
2016-02-06 01:44:18	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-06 01:44:20	 *	@PikFan looks at Miles_
2016-02-06 01:44:32	Scruffy	I want to try something
2016-02-06 01:44:42	@PikFan	?
2016-02-06 01:44:49	Scruffy	To see if the Awakening Wood can land the ship somewhere else without breaking the game
2016-02-06 01:46:44	Scruffy	If so then I can COMPLETELY redesign the map
2016-02-06 01:48:17	@PikFan	woah
2016-02-06 01:48:38	@PikFan	wait, you can move the position of obstacles...?!
2016-02-06 01:48:56	@PikFan	or anything, really?
2016-02-06 01:49:03	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 01:49:08	@PikFan	.../wow/
2016-02-06 01:51:15	Scruffy	So hopefully the ship and Onions can move without undue consequences
2016-02-06 01:51:55	Scruffy	Unless they don't carry their carrying waypoints with them
2016-02-06 01:52:29	@PikFan	oh, right
2016-02-06 01:52:44	@PikFan	also, can you change the position of caves?
2016-02-06 01:52:56	@PikFan	can you change the caves themselves?
2016-02-06 01:53:48	Scruffy	I can change the position of caves
2016-02-06 01:53:58	Scruffy	And I /think/ I can change caves
2016-02-06 01:54:02	Scruffy	It's risky
2016-02-06 01:56:19	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-06 01:56:27	Scruffy	But I have to experiment with it
2016-02-06 01:56:31	@PikFan	are you able to add or remove sublevels?
2016-02-06 01:57:02	@PikFan	I'm guessing not, but...
2016-02-06 01:57:15	Scruffy	No
2016-02-06 01:57:17	Scruffy	Although...
2016-02-06 01:57:39	Scruffy	I could, with much work, replace a cave with one of the test caves that has more sublevels...
2016-02-06 01:57:48	Scruffy	That'd be really stretching it though
2016-02-06 01:58:16	Scruffy	I dunno, it doesn't seem to bad to add/remove sublevels, there are just a few parameters I don't understand yet
2016-02-06 02:00:22	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-02-06 02:00:31	@PikFan	well, I don't want to overburden you
2016-02-06 02:00:47	@PikFan	but is it possible to remove caves entirely?
2016-02-06 02:00:58	Scruffy	I don't think so...
2016-02-06 02:01:01	@PikFan	ah
2016-02-06 02:01:08	Scruffy	If I did all its treasures would have to go somewhere
2016-02-06 02:01:22	@PikFan	that's kinda the point
2016-02-06 02:01:34	@PikFan	cause I love going through places that have tons of collectibles
2016-02-06 02:01:38	@PikFan	like Mission Mode
2016-02-06 02:02:32	@PikFan	has Espyo been helping you any?
2016-02-06 02:02:42	@PikFan	...almost typed helping as "helpying"
2016-02-06 02:02:52	Scruffy	I've been helping him, with technical info that I discover
2016-02-06 02:03:00	@PikFan	oh
2016-02-06 02:03:31	Scruffy	Otherwise there isn't much to help with; pikmin 2 is a mystery
2016-02-06 02:04:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-06 02:04:33	@PikFan	how much stuff is in Japanese?
2016-02-06 02:04:52	Scruffy	Most of it
2016-02-06 02:04:57	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-06 02:05:05	@PikFan	good thing I'm taking Japanese, then
2016-02-06 02:05:10	Scruffy	And a greater deal of it is files I can't read
2016-02-06 02:05:31	Scruffy	As in, can't encode at all, let alone translate, because they aren't text
2016-02-06 02:05:47	Scruffy	But really that's only if I wanted to edit models or animations themselves

2016-02-06 02:33:51	Neocraftz1553	but it only talks about red yellow and blue pikmin...

2016-02-06 02:34:17	Neocraftz1553	Purple and White Pikmin COULD exist
2016-02-06 02:34:19	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-06 02:34:30	Neocraftz1553	Purple = Fatter
2016-02-06 02:34:37	@PikFan	animals can be heavy (Purples), poisonous (Whites), shelled (Rocks), and flying (Winged)
2016-02-06 02:34:40	Neocraftz1553	White = Poisonous
2016-02-06 02:34:45	Neocraftz1553	oh I see
2016-02-06 02:35:01	@PikFan	but fire resistance? electrical resistance? not possible

2016-02-06 02:35:58	Neocraftz1553	but I HAVE heard about this one animal or bacteria that could resist fire...
2016-02-06 02:35:58	Scruffy	they can if on a different planet though
2016-02-06 02:36:18	Neocraftz1553	PNF-404 for example
2016-02-06 02:36:24	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-02-06 02:36:40	Scruffy	True
2016-02-06 02:36:54	Scruffy	But Pikmin could have migrated from a different planet...?
2016-02-06 02:36:57	Scruffy	Rather than evolving
2016-02-06 02:37:02	Scruffy	Since they have spaceships

2016-02-06 02:38:09	Neocraftz1553	They only low orbit it
2016-02-06 02:38:14	Scruffy	Olimar got there after Onions and Pikmin had settled there
2016-02-06 02:38:14	@PikFan	maybe they've felt an obligation to stay because of Olimar...?
2016-02-06 02:38:26	Neocraftz1553	not sure
2016-02-06 02:38:43	Neocraftz1553	If they are P3's onions, then they could stand a chance
2016-02-06 02:38:52	Neocraftz1553	but not 1/2 onions
2016-02-06 02:40:07	@PikFan	this is a really silly explanation on my part
2016-02-06 02:40:31	@PikFan	but I believe that 1/2 Onions were destroyed and so somehow, the P3 Onions were created
2016-02-06 02:40:49	@PikFan	it's actually the basis of one of my stories
2016-02-06 02:41:10	@PikFan	...which I probably should continue writing it sometime
2016-02-06 02:41:26	@PikFan	I also explain the origin of the Plasm Wraith in it
2016-02-06 02:43:23	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-02-06 02:44:11	@PikFan	Scruffy, we've actually talked about this before :P
2016-02-06 02:44:23	@PikFan	I was explaining it to Neo
2016-02-06 02:44:25	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 02:44:33	Scruffy	It's still exciting though
2016-02-06 02:44:37	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-06 02:44:52	Neocraftz1553	sounds awsome
2016-02-06 02:45:26	@PikFan	thanks
2016-02-06 02:46:00	Neocraftz1553	Maybe the Pikmin themselves somehow constructed P3's Onions from Glass and other materials
2016-02-06 02:47:24	Neocraftz1553	they do look more technological than the other onions
2016-02-06 02:48:05	Neocraftz1553	I mean, they do have thrusters as shown in the end of the day
2016-02-06 02:48:19	@PikFan	well...
2016-02-06 02:48:20	Neocraftz1553	or something of the like to propel them into the sky
2016-02-06 02:48:35	@PikFan	see, I was thinking that an alien race appeared one day
2016-02-06 02:48:45	@PikFan	different from the Hocotatians and Koppaites
2016-02-06 02:49:00	@PikFan	pitying the Pikmin, they give them the technology and intelligence needed to build Onions
2016-02-06 02:49:30	@PikFan	unfortunately, they leave one of their failed bioengineering experiments on the planet — the Plasm Wraith
2016-02-06 02:50:13	Neocraftz1553	what about the Water wraith and the Goolix?
2016-02-06 02:50:24	@PikFan	shh...
2016-02-06 02:50:27	@PikFan	kidding
2016-02-06 02:50:33	@PikFan	hmm, I'm not sure
2016-02-06 02:50:38	Neocraftz1553	aww
2016-02-06 02:50:54	Scruffy	This guy just beat his own world record
2016-02-06 02:50:56	@PikFan	well, maybe the Goolix is somehow just an ordinary creature
2016-02-06 02:50:58	Scruffy	by 9 minutes
2016-02-06 02:51:00	@PikFan	wow
2016-02-06 02:51:03	Scruffy	For getting all treasures in Pikmin 2
2016-02-06 02:51:13	Neocraftz1553	Sounds like a cool explanation
2016-02-06 02:51:14	Scruffy	 5:41:55:16
2016-02-06 02:51:16	@PikFan	wait, he set the world record for Pikmin 2?
2016-02-06 02:51:27	Neocraftz1553	but then again, I am pretty gullible...
2016-02-06 02:51:47	@PikFan	and then the Waterwraith is truly an interdimensional interloper
2016-02-06 02:51:48	Neocraftz1553	Hello En_Passant
2016-02-06 02:51:57	En_Passant	hi
2016-02-06 02:52:05	Neocraftz1553	I just noticed him
2016-02-06 02:52:10	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-06 02:52:40	En_Passant	His record's mostly uncontested, though
2016-02-06 02:53:02	En_Passant	Being the only one with a serious run means by default, you have wr
2016-02-06 02:53:14	Scruffy	WOw
2016-02-06 02:53:48	@PikFan	wait
2016-02-06 02:53:55	En_Passant	I was afk because I was watching it lol
2016-02-06 02:54:10	@PikFan	so...he's the only one to do a 100% speedrun of Pikmin 2? the only documented one, anyway?
2016-02-06 02:54:23	@PikFan	that doesn't seem right
2016-02-06 02:54:24	En_Passant	Not the only one, I don't think
2016-02-06 02:54:38	@PikFan	well, hence the "only documented one" bit
2016-02-06 02:54:54	@PikFan	...oh, I see what you're saying
2016-02-06 02:55:13	@PikFan	but even so, I don't see what's so special about this speedrun
2016-02-06 02:55:14	En_Passant	http://www.speedrun.com/pikmin2#All_Treasures1
2016-02-06 02:55:51	Neocraftz1553	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii_worm
2016-02-06 02:57:28	Neocraftz1553	They say it is the most fire resistant creature on this planet
2016-02-06 02:58:03	Scruffy	After the taligradees
2016-02-06 02:58:09	Scruffy	tardigrades*
2016-02-06 02:58:09	En_Passant	At 176 F, yes
2016-02-06 02:58:38	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-02-06 02:58:52	Neocraftz1553	not nearly enough
2016-02-06 03:04:11	Neocraftz1553	and the most electrically resistant animals have to be electric fish...
2016-02-06 03:04:53	@PikFan	you mean the Zapfish? :D
2016-02-06 03:05:08	Neocraftz1553	Poison resistance comes with evolution, aka Super-Bugs
2016-02-06 03:05:11	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-06 03:05:29	En_Passant	It seems like there should be a way to develop electric resistance
2016-02-06 03:05:39	En_Passant	Just coat yourself in an insulator
2016-02-06 03:06:17	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-06 03:06:30	Neocraftz1553	but animals can't naturally do that
2016-02-06 03:06:40	Neocraftz1553	nor are they born with the coating
2016-02-06 03:06:52	Neocraftz1553	unless they evolved it, of course
2016-02-06 03:07:05	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-02-06 03:08:21	@PikFan	the video I posted earlier says that Yellows aren't possible because they're shown to withstand lightning
2016-02-06 03:08:38	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-02-06 03:08:48	En_Passant	They are?
2016-02-06 03:08:57	@PikFan	Bingo Battle
2016-02-06 03:09:01	Neocraftz1553	If they can withstand lightning, they can stand on the surface of the sun
2016-02-06 03:09:27	En_Passant	I don't think that's a real lightning bolt being called down
2016-02-06 03:09:29	Neocraftz1553	lightning is hotter than the surface of the sun, if I am not mistaken
2016-02-06 03:09:34	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-02-06 03:09:35	@PikFan	true
2016-02-06 03:09:44	En_Passant	It's the size of a quarter
2016-02-06 03:09:57	@PikFan	though, he calculates that they can withstand 76 billion volts per square inch
2016-02-06 03:10:09	@PikFan	which isn't possible
2016-02-06 03:10:15	Neocraftz1553	It could be an "Attack Spero" that sends an arc of electricity
2016-02-06 03:10:25	En_Passant	If it was a real bolt, yeah
2016-02-06 03:10:29	@PikFan	but this is, again, based on the tiny—yeah
2016-02-06 03:10:52	En_Passant	Also, isn't it amps that kills, not volts?
2016-02-06 03:11:00	@PikFan	*shrug*
2016-02-06 03:11:07	Neocraftz1553	idk
2016-02-06 03:11:43	Neocraftz1553	We have to remember, Pikmin are small
2016-02-06 03:12:21	Neocraftz1553	I just had a thought...
2016-02-06 03:12:37	Scruffy	But to tardigrades, they are still really big
2016-02-06 03:12:49	Neocraftz1553	Why would Yellow Pikmin need to evolve electrical resistance in P2?
2016-02-06 03:13:02	@PikFan	because Nintendo logic, clearly
2016-02-06 03:13:03	Scruffy	To serve Olimar of course
2016-02-06 03:13:05	@PikFan	/sarcasm
2016-02-06 03:13:14	Neocraftz1553	They have no predators that use electricity above ground
2016-02-06 03:13:24	@PikFan	that is true
2016-02-06 03:13:26	En_Passant	Electricity was intended for P1 iirc
2016-02-06 03:13:33	En_Passant	So let's say they always had it
2016-02-06 03:13:36	Neocraftz1553	Yeah ik
2016-02-06 03:13:50	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-02-06 03:13:54	Scruffy	Ugh all these acronyms making me feel old
2016-02-06 03:13:55	En_Passant	Instead of overanalyzing differences between games
2016-02-06 03:14:00	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-06 03:14:02	@PikFan	heh, why?
2016-02-06 03:14:08	Scruffy	I don't know any of them
2016-02-06 03:14:26	Neocraftz1553	that is what we do
2016-02-06 03:14:31	@PikFan	you mean like... P1?
2016-02-06 03:14:40	Neocraftz1553	overanalyze games for fun
2016-02-06 03:15:19	Scruffy	No I mean ik, iirc, afk
2016-02-06 03:15:20	Neocraftz1553	instead of P1 let use...
2016-02-06 03:15:24	Scruffy	I can look them up
2016-02-06 03:15:29	@PikFan	ik = I know
2016-02-06 03:15:30	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-02-06 03:15:31	En_Passant	oh
2016-02-06 03:15:33	En_Passant	rofl
2016-02-06 03:15:37	En_Passant	There's another one
2016-02-06 03:15:38	Scruffy	But it's just the fact I have to
2016-02-06 03:15:38	@PikFan	iirc = if I recall correctly
2016-02-06 03:15:46	@PikFan	afk = away from keyboard
2016-02-06 03:16:09	@PikFan	here's one that you guys probably don't know:
2016-02-06 03:16:11	@PikFan	otoh
2016-02-06 03:16:23	Neocraftz1553	lol, rofl
2016-02-06 03:16:31	Scruffy	I know those two
2016-02-06 03:16:34	Scruffy	I don't know otoh
2016-02-06 03:16:40	En_Passant	off top of head?
2016-02-06 03:16:43	@PikFan	I learned it from J
2016-02-06 03:16:47	@PikFan	on the other hand
2016-02-06 03:16:53	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-06 03:17:01	Scruffy	Oh, and I know of yolo
2016-02-06 03:17:05	@PikFan	haha
2016-02-06 03:17:08	Scruffy	But it's grammatically incorrect
2016-02-06 03:17:09	@PikFan	I think we all do
2016-02-06 03:17:12	Scruffy	It should be yloo
2016-02-06 03:17:16	Scruffy	You Live Only Once
2016-02-06 03:17:22	@PikFan	yloo!
2016-02-06 03:17:25	@PikFan	yellow
2016-02-06 03:17:40	@PikFan	Yellow Pikmin
2016-02-06 03:18:00	Neocraftz1553	Why woild they need to be electrical resistant in P1?
2016-02-06 03:18:20	Neocraftz1553	the question comes back
2016-02-06 03:19:03	Neocraftz1553	In P3, they would need electrical resistance to keep from being paralyzed by the bearded Amprat
2016-02-06 03:19:16	Neocraftz1553	being paralyzed makes them easy prey
2016-02-06 03:19:43	Neocraftz1553	And any Pikmin could hold a bomb rock in P1 if they wanted to
2016-02-06 03:22:37	@PikFan	Pikmin are weird
2016-02-06 03:22:42	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-02-06 03:22:48	Neocraftz1553	and cool
2016-02-06 03:23:44	Neocraftz1553	The Onion could hold an infinite amount of Pikmin for aome reason
2016-02-06 03:24:23	Neocraftz1553	somehow
2016-02-06 03:25:46	Neocraftz1553	even 100 Pikmin is too much for the onion
2016-02-06 03:27:05	Neocraftz1553	brb, might disconnect, mobile
2016-02-06 03:28:18	Neocraftz1553	hmm....
2016-02-06 03:29:00	Neocraftz1553	There are almost NO fan-made gates here
2016-02-06 03:29:09	Scruffy	I have a few
2016-02-06 03:29:38	Neocraftz1553	mesh fences and sponge bridge
2016-02-06 03:29:53	Neocraftz1553	I have to say, they are pretty creative
2016-02-06 03:29:55	Scruffy	and a few others
2016-02-06 03:30:03	Scruffy	I should really add some omre
2016-02-06 03:30:04	Scruffy	more*
2016-02-06 03:30:31	Neocraftz1553	I have a huge book almost filled out with TONs of Pikmin:Return Beta Stuff
2016-02-06 03:30:38	Scruffy	Woah
2016-02-06 03:30:44	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-06 03:31:26	Neocraftz1553	Some of it has Ideas from other users and friends, but lots of it I made on my own
2016-02-06 03:32:07	Neocraftz1553	one such gate is: A brittle Plastic gate similer to the Glass fence that is filled with water
2016-02-06 03:32:21	@PikFan	back
2016-02-06 03:32:23	@PikFan	ooh
2016-02-06 03:32:38	Neocraftz1553	as Pikmin attack it, Chunks from the Top fall out.and the watee drains a bit
2016-02-06 03:32:49	Neocraftz1553	drowning all non blue Pikmin
2016-02-06 03:32:55	@PikFan	speaking of obstacle ideas, it always bothered me that there were small obstacles for fire, electricity, and poison in Pikmin 2
2016-02-06 03:33:03	@PikFan	so I came up with a sprinkler idea
2016-02-06 03:33:11	Neocraftz1553	ooo
2016-02-06 03:33:15	Neocraftz1553	sounds cool
2016-02-06 03:33:40	Neocraftz1553	It SpRinkelz FyRr :P
2016-02-06 03:33:46	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-02-06 03:33:51	@PikFan	and on the topic of gates, I had an idea for a gate that could open only if enough pressure was applied
2016-02-06 03:33:58	@PikFan	like, you need Purple Pikin
2016-02-06 03:34:00	@PikFan	*Pikmin
2016-02-06 03:34:18	Neocraftz1553	See saw blocks?
2016-02-06 03:34:22	@PikFan	it's similar to bamboo gates, except with pressure plates and Purple Pikmin
2016-02-06 03:34:34	@PikFan	so like, the pressure plate is next to the gate
2016-02-06 03:34:36	Neocraftz1553	maybe the Purples Push it
2016-02-06 03:34:45	@PikFan	once it's completely pressed down by Purples, the gate opens
2016-02-06 03:34:51	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-02-06 03:34:57	Neocraftz1553	sounds cool
2016-02-06 03:35:07	Neocraftz1553	so like a bamboo gate for purples
2016-02-06 03:35:11	@PikFan	yup
2016-02-06 03:35:21	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-06 03:36:12	Neocraftz1553	It kinda bothees me that in P2 poisons gates are normal gates with Poison Pies under them...
2016-02-06 03:36:20	@PikFan	hey, do you have any obstacle ideas for White Pikmin?
2016-02-06 03:36:24	<--	RingtailedFox (FoxFoxFox@2001:470:1d:pzg:qolv:mghv:gvzz:usku) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2016-02-06 03:36:27	Neocraftz1553	me?
2016-02-06 03:36:31	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-06 03:36:35	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-02-06 03:36:55	Neocraftz1553	I do not have my book withme but I'll try to think of one
2016-02-06 03:37:00	@PikFan	oh
2016-02-06 03:37:13	@PikFan	cause like, I wanted to make an obstacle based off their speed
2016-02-06 03:37:14	En_Passant	Obstacles FOR Whites?
2016-02-06 03:37:21	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-06 03:37:24	En_Passant	So, one that only works against Whites?
2016-02-06 03:37:40	@PikFan	well, I meant one that requires White Pikmin to be disabled
2016-02-06 03:37:55	Neocraftz1553	I might disconnect
2016-02-06 03:37:59	Neocraftz1553	actually, gtg
2016-02-06 03:38:00	@PikFan	specifically, it requires their speed
2016-02-06 03:38:03	@PikFan	oh okay
2016-02-06 03:38:04	@PikFan	see ya
2016-02-06 03:38:09	Neocraftz1553	cya
2016-02-06 03:38:19	Scruffy	see ya
2016-02-06 03:38:20	En_Passant	Is something wrong with poison pipes?
2016-02-06 03:38:30	@PikFan	too canon
2016-02-06 03:38:32	En_Passant	bye
2016-02-06 03:38:47	Scruffy	brb
2016-02-06 03:39:00	@PikFan	like sure, there could be tons of things you could use poison pipes for, but...
2016-02-06 03:39:05	@PikFan	it just feels so unoriginal
2016-02-06 03:39:14	@PikFan	I want to emphasize their speed more
2016-02-06 03:39:26	@PikFan	and I want to design an obstacle that requires their speed to overcome
2016-02-06 03:39:36	Scruffy	A treadmill operated gate?
2016-02-06 03:39:42	@PikFan	but since speed is such an abstract thing, I can't—
2016-02-06 03:39:44	Scruffy	Kinda far-fetched but
2016-02-06 03:39:46	@PikFan	hmm, possibly

2016-02-06 03:45:40	@PikFan	meanwhile, I'm having fun with Japanese
2016-02-06 03:45:49	@PikFan	I know what this means:
2016-02-06 03:45:50	@PikFan	きのう は, 八 時 に  私 の 家 で ばんごはん を 食べました.
2016-02-06 03:47:16	@PikFan	the first part, きのう, means "yesterday"
2016-02-06 03:47:31	@PikFan	then 八 時 means 8'o clock
2016-02-06 03:47:55	@PikFan	私 の 家 means "my house"
2016-02-06 03:48:27	@PikFan	ばんごはん means "dinner"
2016-02-06 03:48:43	@PikFan	and finally, 食べました means "I ate"
2016-02-06 03:49:09	@PikFan	so, this translates to: "Yesterday at 8 o'clock, I ate dinner at my house."
2016-02-06 03:58:08	Scruffy	Back
2016-02-06 03:58:12	Scruffy	Awesome!
2016-02-06 03:58:32	@PikFan	hopefully learning Japanese will eventually let me translate Japanese gaming websites...
2016-02-06 04:04:51	En_Passant	Can Whites detect underground treasures in PCW?
2016-02-06 04:05:05	@PikFan	hm
2016-02-06 04:05:26	@PikFan	considering that Brown Pikmin can dig...
2016-02-06 04:05:35	@PikFan	well, dig better than other types, I mean
2016-02-06 04:06:12	Scruffy	Maybe you'll have to give White Pikmin something new
2016-02-06 04:06:15	Scruffy	To compensate
2016-02-06 04:06:20	@PikFan	well, Whites can still see them, but you'd need Brown to unbury the treasures
2016-02-06 04:06:28	@PikFan	though that sounds overly complicated
2016-02-06 04:14:01	En_Passant	Do you have to collect corpses in Twilight Hollow Remix?
2016-02-06 04:14:10	@PikFan	uhhhh
2016-02-06 04:14:44	@PikFan	yeah, you do
2016-02-06 04:14:50	@PikFan	as with all other CT stages
2016-02-06 04:14:57	@PikFan	except they go to the Onions
2016-02-06 04:17:25	En_Passant	that would explain why I was short just a little
2016-02-06 04:19:56	@PikFan	mm
2016-02-06 04:22:43	En_Passant	Well, I'm going to grind that
2016-02-06 04:23:04	@PikFan	good luck
2016-02-06 04:23:11	En_Passant	I'll be here on mobile

2016-02-06 04:35:40	Scruffy	I was considering creating a Let's Play of Pikmin, but I'm still trying to figure out the point
2016-02-06 04:36:30	Scruffy	A Let's Play of Pikmin 2: Up Late would be appropriate, but I don't know about the canon game
2016-02-06 04:39:48	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-06 04:40:02	@PikFan	I'll never do a Let's Play because I have a horrible voice
2016-02-06 04:40:09	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-06 04:40:12	Scruffy	Oh come on
2016-02-06 04:40:17	Scruffy	It can't be that bad
2016-02-06 04:40:32	@PikFan	it's way too high-pitched for my age
2016-02-06 04:40:53	@PikFan	and I also have a lisp and a stutter, so that doesn't help

2016-02-06 04:41:53	@PikFan	it just... is not right
2016-02-06 04:41:58	Scruffy	I think people can often look past the voice as long as the character is good
2016-02-06 04:42:06	Scruffy	Er, listen past the voice
2016-02-06 04:42:13	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-02-06 04:43:03	Scruffy	It seems like it'd be fun to make a Let's Play, but I don't know if my computer can handle it
2016-02-06 04:43:11	Scruffy	Based on how big video recording becomes
2016-02-06 04:43:23	@PikFan	true
2016-02-06 04:43:36	@PikFan	well, I mean, I COULD make a Let's Play at some point...
2016-02-06 04:43:43	@PikFan	if you guys really wanted me to
2016-02-06 04:45:12	Scruffy	and that's the other thing
2016-02-06 04:45:16	Scruffy	There are so many out there
2016-02-06 04:45:24	Scruffy	What's the idea behind making another?
2016-02-06 04:45:27	Scruffy	Just being popular?
2016-02-06 04:45:32	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-06 04:48:01	@PikFan	well, there's probably less Pikmin 3 LPs because it's been out less
2016-02-06 04:49:12	Scruffy	yeah
2016-02-06 04:49:25	Scruffy	I don't really have a method of recording that at all though
2016-02-06 04:49:32	@PikFan	hm
2016-02-06 04:49:33	Scruffy	I guess I'll just stick to Up Late
2016-02-06 04:49:41	Scruffy	Once it's a bit more complete, of course
2016-02-06 04:50:05	@PikFan	right
2016-02-06 04:51:20	Scruffy	Alright, my first test of a displaced ship
2016-02-06 04:52:14	Scruffy	In the Awakening Wood, I've placed it where one of the red Burgeoning spiderwort should go
2016-02-06 04:54:20	@PikFan	neat
2016-02-06 04:56:25	@PikFan	so, how's the game reacting?
2016-02-06 04:56:34	Scruffy	I have to get there first
2016-02-06 04:56:44	Scruffy	I've already altered day 2 substantially
2016-02-06 04:56:46	Scruffy	It's hard :(
2016-02-06 04:56:49	@PikFan	oh
2016-02-06 04:57:09	Scruffy	But you can still get the Sphere Chart on Day 2
2016-02-06 04:57:15	@PikFan	nice
2016-02-06 04:57:59	Scruffy	In fact, I have it sitting on the ledge right next to the ship, mocking you
2016-02-06 04:58:49	@PikFan	hahahah
2016-02-06 04:59:27	@PikFan	so then, how do you get it?
2016-02-06 04:59:41	Scruffy	you have to go to the emergence cave and get Purple Pikmin first
2016-02-06 04:59:53	Scruffy	And then return to the surface and get it
2016-02-06 04:59:58	@PikFan	ahhh
2016-02-06 05:03:16	En_Passant	3 seconds left
2016-02-06 05:03:21	En_Passant	I can do better
2016-02-06 05:03:44	@PikFan	you can do it!
2016-02-06 05:20:24	Scruffy	Okay, so the ship lands fine, but cutscenes are out of place and Olimar and Louie still land in the same spot
2016-02-06 05:21:53	Scruffy	Yeah, doesn't work
2016-02-06 05:22:03	Scruffy	Pikmin who carry treasures don't move anywhere
2016-02-06 05:22:08	Scruffy	They don't know where to go
2016-02-06 05:23:10	Scruffy	As cool as it would be...
2016-02-06 05:23:18	@PikFan	aww...
2016-02-06 05:24:18	@PikFan	so in order to make it really work, you'd have to redo tons of other things...?
2016-02-06 05:24:52	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 05:24:56	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-06 05:25:06	@PikFan	well, that's too bad that you couldn't move the ship
2016-02-06 05:25:14	@PikFan	at least you can still move other things
2016-02-06 05:25:22	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 05:25:50	@PikFan	what about bodies of water?
2016-02-06 05:26:05	@PikFan	what can you do with those?
2016-02-06 05:27:10	Scruffy	I can change their depth and dimensions, certainly
2016-02-06 05:27:18	Scruffy	I could cover a whole area if I felt like it
2016-02-06 05:27:23	Scruffy	I don't know about caves though
2016-02-06 05:27:37	@PikFan	can you try flooding the Awakening Wood?
2016-02-06 05:27:42	Scruffy	Sure
2016-02-06 05:28:17	@PikFan	awesome
2016-02-06 05:32:57	En_Passant	Lol
2016-02-06 05:33:07	En_Passant	Got 30 secs
2016-02-06 05:33:13	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-02-06 05:33:32	@PikFan	yay
2016-02-06 05:33:38	@PikFan	so, platinum then?
2016-02-06 05:33:46	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-02-06 05:33:49	@PikFan	nice
2016-02-06 05:33:52	En_Passant	Got that before
2016-02-06 05:33:57	@PikFan	OH
2016-02-06 05:34:09	En_Passant	But there were some notable flaws that I wanted to fix
2016-02-06 05:34:17	@PikFan	I thought you meant 3 seconds as in "3 seconds left before time runs out"
2016-02-06 05:34:27	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-02-06 05:34:40	En_Passant	Finished with 3 secs left
2016-02-06 05:34:46	@PikFan	ah, I see now
2016-02-06 05:35:15	En_Passant	I wouldn't dare chat in the middle of an attempt lol
2016-02-06 05:39:17	En_Passant	So you can change depth?
2016-02-06 05:39:27	Scruffy	Yep
2016-02-06 05:39:34	Scruffy	I've flooded the Awakening Wood
2016-02-06 05:39:35	En_Passant	What would happen if the depth was larger than the basin?
2016-02-06 05:39:47	Scruffy	Interestingly, Pikmin come out just fine
2016-02-06 05:40:02	Scruffy	See, each water body is actually a cube of water
2016-02-06 05:40:26	Scruffy	I think Pikmin have to cross a boundary of the cube to consider themselves drowning
2016-02-06 05:40:37	Scruffy	But Red Pikmin are completely submerged and doing fine
2016-02-06 05:40:50	En_Passant	lol
2016-02-06 05:40:55	@PikFan	can you post a screenshot of the flooded Awakening Wood?
2016-02-06 05:41:17	Scruffy	There's actually water under water
2016-02-06 05:41:18	Scruffy	Sure
2016-02-06 05:42:17	@PikFan	yay
2016-02-06 05:43:09	En_Passant	Are bridges customizable?
2016-02-06 05:43:24	Scruffy	I don't think so
2016-02-06 05:43:47	Scruffy	I can change their location but there's something I can't find that governs their length
2016-02-06 05:46:09	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/2/23/Flooded_Awakening_Wood_Test.png
2016-02-06 05:46:54	@PikFan	beautiful
2016-02-06 05:48:07	@PikFan	how high is the water?
2016-02-06 05:48:39	Scruffy	Just high enough that the /propeller/ of the ship sticks out
2016-02-06 05:50:44	Scruffy	I did not expect that the water refraction effect would work both ways, but it does
2016-02-06 05:50:59	@PikFan	both ways?
2016-02-06 05:51:08	@PikFan	you mean from under the surface of the water, too?
2016-02-06 05:51:14	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 05:51:26	@PikFan	can you post a screenshot of that?
2016-02-06 05:51:31	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 05:51:46	@PikFan	I've always wondered what it looks like from that angle, because normally it's impossible...
2016-02-06 05:55:29	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/4/46/Flooded_Awakening_Wood_Underwater.png
2016-02-06 05:56:01	@PikFan	woah
2016-02-06 05:56:29	@PikFan	okay, sorry, one more request
2016-02-06 05:56:36	Scruffy	Mhm?
2016-02-06 05:57:10	@PikFan	can you get a picture exactly like the first one, except that the water level is lowered to about halfway on the ship?
2016-02-06 05:57:51	Scruffy	Sure! May I ask how come?
2016-02-06 05:58:15	@PikFan	because I want to see things that aren't refracted
2016-02-06 05:58:22	Scruffy	Ah
2016-02-06 05:58:24	@PikFan	because everything in the first one is refracted
2016-02-06 05:58:37	Scruffy	Ah I see
2016-02-06 06:05:02	@PikFan	En_Passant: what's the point of this? http://www.pikminfanon.com/PCW
2016-02-06 06:05:28	@PikFan	you said that you're too lazy to type in the full name, but...
2016-02-06 06:05:59	@PikFan	hm, I wonder if others also commonly search for "PCW"
2016-02-06 06:07:26	Scruffy	Changing the waterbox also renders the drain useless apparently
2016-02-06 06:07:36	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Half_Flooded_Awakening_Wood.png
2016-02-06 06:08:05	@PikFan	ah, much better
2016-02-06 06:08:23	@PikFan	better contrast
2016-02-06 06:14:35	En_Passant	I mean, there's not exactly a reason NOT to have the shortcut
2016-02-06 06:14:54	En_Passant	Also, Formidable Oak Remix was surprisingly easy
2016-02-06 06:15:16	Scruffy	Maybe for some people

2016-02-06 06:37:57	@PikFan	hm

2016-02-06 11:46:07	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-02-06 11:46:08	Testyo	if you have a laptop, that'd be a great time you code it, something is DEFINITELY wrong
2016-02-06 11:47:59	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-06 11:51:24	Yoshi2	ok, so today we were going to replace some pipes below our sink in the bathroom, and it seems those pipes are FUBAR
2016-02-06 11:51:40	@Espyo	their brand is FUBAR?
2016-02-06 11:52:05	Yoshi2	no, but they are fucked up beyond any repair
2016-02-06 11:52:53	Yoshi2	and might extend beyond what we see, so we need to call somebody more qualified who would replace the entire contraption inside the wall
2016-02-06 11:53:03	Yoshi2	which
2016-02-06 11:53:06	Yoshi2	would NOT be nice

2016-02-06 17:28:59	Yoshi2	hiho Scruffy 
2016-02-06 17:29:05	Scruffy	Hello
2016-02-06 17:29:08	Scruffy	I can't stay long
2016-02-06 17:29:16	Scruffy	But I wanted to pass some info to Espyo
2016-02-06 17:29:21	@Espyo	sure
2016-02-06 17:29:22	Scruffy	P2 technical stuff
2016-02-06 17:29:30	Scruffy	I flooded the Awakening Wood yesterday
2016-02-06 17:29:38	@Espyo	oh dear
2016-02-06 17:29:42	Scruffy	By changing the dimensions of the waterbox with the drain in it
2016-02-06 17:29:45	@Espyo	oh dear oh dear
2016-02-06 17:29:52	Scruffy	But Pikmin came out fine
2016-02-06 17:30:01	@Espyo	I'm imagining this hilarious and frightening hellscape
2016-02-06 17:30:06	Scruffy	Even if they were thrown above the surface
2016-02-06 17:30:09	Scruffy	Hold on
2016-02-06 17:30:11	@Espyo	heh, I would imagine so--
2016-02-06 17:30:17	@Espyo	oh, that part makes less sense
2016-02-06 17:30:19	@Espyo	the surface part
2016-02-06 17:30:32	Scruffy	I have photos
2016-02-06 17:30:39	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-06 17:30:41	Scruffy	Apparently water refracts from both sides
2016-02-06 17:31:00	Scruffy	Here's high tide
2016-02-06 17:31:01	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/2/23/Flooded_Awakening_Wood_Test.png
2016-02-06 17:31:03	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-02-06 17:31:16	Scruffy	Low tide http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Half_Flooded_Awakening_Wood.png
2016-02-06 17:31:18	@Espyo	heh, neat
2016-02-06 17:31:32	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-06 17:31:34	Scruffy	And underwater
2016-02-06 17:31:35	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Flooded_Awakening_Wood_Underwater.png
2016-02-06 17:32:03	Yoshi2	that is very hard to look at
2016-02-06 17:32:04	@Espyo	if the waterboxes messed with the colors, that would really be a sight to see
2016-02-06 17:32:12	Klemen702	hey scruffboy
2016-02-06 17:32:23	Scruffy	So I think non-Blue Pikmin and leaders have to physically cross the boundaries of the waterbox to be considered "in water"
2016-02-06 17:32:29	@Espyo	yeah, guess so
2016-02-06 17:32:32	Scruffy	Leaders didn't make splashing noises either
2016-02-06 17:32:33	@Espyo	but you said you threw them to the surface
2016-02-06 17:32:41	@Espyo	so they'd fall back inside, I'd imagine
2016-02-06 17:32:52	Scruffy	I don't think the top or bottom matter
2016-02-06 17:32:59	@Espyo	but
2016-02-06 17:33:06	@Espyo	they're the only parts that can matter...
2016-02-06 17:33:11	Scruffy	The top is just where Pikmin head if they are already drowning
2016-02-06 17:33:11	@Espyo	bottom and side are always out of bounds
2016-02-06 17:33:27	Scruffy	If Pikmin are told to drown, they float to the top
2016-02-06 17:33:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-06 17:33:46	Scruffy	But they can only be told to drown after they cross one of the sides
2016-02-06 17:33:50	Scruffy	Is my theory
2016-02-06 17:33:55	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-06 17:34:03	@Espyo	but like I said, the sides of the waterboxes are out of bounds
2016-02-06 17:34:08	Scruffy	If they have always been in the waterbox, there's no boundary telling them it's okay to drown now
2016-02-06 17:34:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-06 17:34:15	Scruffy	I don't know
2016-02-06 17:34:33	Scruffy	Maybe there's an invisible boundary that extends upwards from the waterbox
2016-02-06 17:34:41	@Espyo	maybe

2016-02-06 17:36:04	Scruffy	Oh and one more thing
2016-02-06 17:36:19	Scruffy	I finally found a condition where Onion discovery with 100 Pikmin crashed the game
2016-02-06 17:36:30	@Espyo	oh?!
2016-02-06 17:36:37	Scruffy	Unfortunately it involved a changed game
2016-02-06 17:36:42	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-06 17:36:48	Scruffy	I had told you before that if Louie discovers the Red Onion on day 2
2016-02-06 17:37:03	Scruffy	All this weird stuff happens but one Pikmin is still sent to the Onion
2016-02-06 17:37:16	Scruffy	Well, that happened when those 100 Pikmin were /off-screen/
2016-02-06 17:37:47	Scruffy	I tried it such that Louie discovered the Red Onion on Day 2 with Olimar and 100 Red Pikmin beneath the Onion
2016-02-06 17:38:09	Scruffy	And as soon as the Red Onion had to spout a seed, the game froze
2016-02-06 17:38:24	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-02-06 17:38:51	Scruffy	It was very surprising, I was just expecting one of Olimar's Pikmin to disappear
2016-02-06 17:38:56	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-06 17:39:00	@Espyo	like in the other two games
2016-02-06 17:39:25	Scruffy	Unfortunately, there's no way to conduct that without changing the number of Pikmin on day 1
2016-02-06 17:39:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-06 17:40:26	@Espyo	somehow, pathfinding on the engine is working fine first try
2016-02-06 17:40:39	@Espyo	but because I'm still testing, I need a simple way to represent all parts of the algorithm
2016-02-06 17:40:43	@Espyo	Olimar is the starting point
2016-02-06 17:40:45	@Espyo	Louie is the end point
2016-02-06 17:40:53	@Espyo	the President is an obstacle in the middle of a path
2016-02-06 17:40:56	Scruffy	oh, I gotta go
2016-02-06 17:40:56	Scruffy	Just wanted to show you that
2016-02-06 17:40:57	@Espyo	#debugginglife
2016-02-06 17:41:00	@Espyo	all right, thakns

2016-02-06 17:42:10	Yoshi2	Espyo: can the form of the obstacle the president represents be changed?
2016-02-06 17:47:47	@Espyo	how so?
2016-02-06 17:48:04	Klemen702	bye esp
2016-02-06 17:48:15	@Espyo	oh, I just meant I'd be right back
2016-02-06 17:48:30	@Espyo	not really a "be right back that's actually 2 hours, so it's not really 'right back'"
2016-02-06 17:48:44	Yoshi2	the 2 hours "brb" is the worst
2016-02-06 17:49:04	Yoshi2	Espyo: you said that in your testing the president represents an obstacle in the middle of the path
2016-02-06 17:49:07	@Espyo	if only English had some way of expressing the idea that you'll return in something like 2 hours
2016-02-06 17:49:09	@Espyo	such as "be back later"
2016-02-06 17:49:41	@Espyo	yeah, if the pathfinder detects the President between two nodes that make up a path, that link is considered invalid, since there's an "obstacle"
2016-02-06 17:51:03	Yoshi2	so the shape of the obstacle doesn't really matter because the president just blocks an entire path
2016-02-06 17:51:15	@Espyo	well, it does matter
2016-02-06 17:51:26	@Espyo	all objects are cylinders as far as the game cares
2016-02-06 17:51:45	@Espyo	I could've used something bigger than the President to ensure that its circle would cross the line
2016-02-06 17:51:51	@Espyo	but he works fine enough

2016-02-06 21:55:25	Testyo	hey good
2016-02-06 21:56:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: remember when I showed you this picture: http://i.imgur.com/DPGz6Lj.png and said the path at the far bottom was/looked unused?
2016-02-06 21:56:17	Yoshi2	it's actually used in a cutscene at the start
2016-02-06 21:56:25	Yoshi2	but I always skip that cutscene so I missed it
2016-02-06 21:56:45	@Espyo	oh
2016-02-06 21:56:47	@Espyo	heh
2016-02-06 21:57:04	Yoshi2	well, there is still an used part to that path
2016-02-06 21:57:34	Yoshi2	because even in the cutscene you don't see the end of the path that goes into the ocean
2016-02-06 21:58:34	Yoshi2	now that I look at the image again, that map is actually terribly rendered
2016-02-06 21:59:17	Yoshi2	the entire left portion of the map looks absolutely terrible and makes no sense
2016-02-06 21:59:40	Yoshi2	(trees right next to hills, what the hell)
2016-02-06 21:59:48	Yoshi2	and at the far bottom you can see repeated terrain
2016-02-06 22:05:12	@Espyo	heh
2016-02-06 22:06:13	Yoshi2	ingame only a part of the map is used, probably to hide the terrible terrain to the sides
2016-02-06 22:10:16	Yoshi2	it's really funny how meta the game is with the level maps
2016-02-06 22:11:18	Yoshi2	the ingame map only shows a portion of the actual image of the map that is stored inside the data, and this full image only shows a portion of the actual level, with some level geometry existing to the sides
2016-02-06 22:13:14	Yoshi2	if I wanted to document those differences, that would be 3 pictures per level
2016-02-06 22:13:50	Yoshi2	there are 20 levels or so, 60 pictures all together
2016-02-06 22:15:33	Yoshi2	probably not going to document most of those though, because the differences aren't that interesting in most cases
2016-02-06 22:17:18	@Espyo	hehe
2016-02-06 22:21:13	Yoshi2	and would blow up TCRF's resources because each full map file is 1024x1024

2016-02-07 13:50:05	Yoshi2	MIT with a good clause
2016-02-07 14:10:27	Yoshi2	ok, I found at least something the vgmstream plugin for foobar is good for
2016-02-07 14:10:53	Yoshi2	it can play the music in pikmin 2 and wind waker that is in the Stream folder
2016-02-07 14:13:14	@Espyo	hm, good
2016-02-07 14:15:57	Yoshi2	so the ingame music in pikmin does not exist as a stream file, only as bms
2016-02-07 14:18:03	Yoshi2	well, the level music
2016-02-07 14:18:10	@Espyo	in the first game?
2016-02-07 14:18:16	Yoshi2	pikmin 2
2016-02-07 14:18:51	@Espyo	well, it makes sense, since it needs to manipulate the tracks
2016-02-07 14:20:11	Yoshi2	I wonder if we will ever manage to generate the full soundtrack of pikmin 2
2016-02-07 14:23:56	@Espyo	one day...
2016-02-07 14:26:12	Yoshi2	I want to work a bit with generating graphs now, but I need to do homework first...
2016-02-07 14:26:47	@Espyo	nuts
2016-02-07 14:26:51	Yoshi2	I'm always the most productive when it means I get to procrastinate
2016-02-07 14:28:27	Yoshi2	generating a graph from the assembly code would be interesting...
2016-02-07 14:29:32	Yoshi2	also, a graph for the level data from battalion wars would also be very pretty
2016-02-07 14:37:34	@Espyo	mhm
2016-02-07 14:43:04	Yoshi2	I also need to add the info I found about BW/BW2 on the tcrf wiki
2016-02-07 14:45:49	Yoshi2	also make a video on how to do modding in bw, and decipher more of the formats, and and and
2016-02-07 15:12:17	Yoshi2	wind waker doesn't have all of the music as stream files either, odd
2016-02-07 15:12:34	Yoshi2	I guess it also uses a mix of streaming and bms/midi

2016-02-07 15:47:03	@Espyo	because you don't mash buttons
2016-02-07 15:47:38	@Espyo	not quite sure I can tell what that's doing, J
2016-02-07 15:54:16	@J	that's entirely expected
2016-02-07 15:54:33	@J	it's a program that draws an overlay over every window, with some characters on it
2016-02-07 15:54:51	@J	when you type the characters for a window, it closes all the overlays and prints the corresponding window ID
2016-02-07 15:56:19	@J	it's only really useful for tiling window managers, since then the windows won't overlap
2016-02-07 16:16:21	@Espyo	you lost me at the last part

2016-02-08 16:47:37	Yoshi2	constants defined as macros are a blessing and a curse
2016-02-08 16:47:38	Neocraftz1553	It does have two shapes
2016-02-08 16:48:47	Yoshi2	a blessing because it makes using number values in code for specific things more readable, but a curse because when you are deciphering a format, all those constants defined as macros are now digits
2016-02-08 16:49:01	@Espyo	exactly
2016-02-08 16:50:59	Yoshi2	enums are probably kinda similar

2016-02-08 16:51:57	@Espyo	more or less
2016-02-08 16:51:58	@Espyo	yeah?
2016-02-08 16:52:28	Neocraftz1553	do you know which one is the rock pikmin in the .zip you sent me? or is there no rock pikmin in it?
2016-02-08 16:53:05	Scruffy	It ought to be called piki_gray_
2016-02-08 16:53:19	Neocraftz1553	ok, I thought so.
2016-02-08 16:53:20	@Espyo	ok, that looks freaky as hell
2016-02-08 16:53:27	@Espyo	yeah, what Scruffy said
2016-02-08 16:53:42	Neocraftz1553	Imagine running into it
2016-02-08 16:53:51	Scruffy	The Feathered Bulborb?
2016-02-08 16:54:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-08 16:54:29	Scruffy	Heh, sorry
2016-02-08 16:54:46	Scruffy	Its beak means you can't attack the front
2016-02-08 16:54:59	Neocraftz1553	neat
2016-02-08 16:55:00	Scruffy	And it also cannot be stunned in the eyes, it has thicker eye material
2016-02-08 16:55:29	Scruffy	So you have to attack the feathers, and when the Bulborb shakes off Pikmin it ruffles them to shake them in all directions
2016-02-08 16:55:47	Neocraftz1553	The eyes look cool
2016-02-08 16:55:48	Scruffy	It also pecks quickly like a Snagret, but only one Pikmin at a time
2016-02-08 16:55:50	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-02-08 16:57:11	Neocraftz1553	Did you map the images onto the Bulborb? or did you just retexture them?
2016-02-08 16:57:29	Scruffy	Which images? For the beak?
2016-02-08 16:57:40	Neocraftz1553	no, for the origional bulborb
2016-02-08 16:57:49	Scruffy	Oh, yes, I just mapped the original images
2016-02-08 16:58:47	Scruffy	And then the mask texture I used for Glossy color, and the normal texture I used... for normal maps

2016-02-08 17:12:57	Klemen702	i have a suggestion
2016-02-08 17:14:03	Yoshi2	don't think we have any of the /r/pikmin mods here
2016-02-08 17:14:04	@Espyo	not anyone here, no
2016-02-08 17:14:40	Klemen702	ah damn
2016-02-08 17:14:56	Klemen702	i was gonna complain how 99% of subreddits don't make ''boxes'' around people's comments
2016-02-08 17:15:05	Klemen702	cuz when there is like 1 billion comments it's hard to tell who is replying to who
2016-02-08 17:16:12	Yoshi2	the pikmin sub doesn't really receive 1 billion comments, but you could make that suggestion through modmail, I guess
2016-02-08 17:16:43	Klemen702	lol i don't even visit the subreddit
2016-02-08 17:16:47	@Espyo	ugh, yeah

2016-02-08 21:18:06	Yoshi2	but because the compiler likes to optimize a bunch of things away, I need to set special variables like that so I can stop the device and check out the content of its memory
2016-02-08 21:19:01	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-02-08 22:32:35	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, is it ok if I use your onion model in my render?

2016-02-08 22:33:38	Scruffy	By the way, do you have a bunch of tiny objects floating around them all/

2016-02-08 22:34:16	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-02-08 22:34:17	Scruffy	Some of them are tiny trianbles
2016-02-08 22:34:21	Scruffy	triangles*
2016-02-08 22:35:04	Scruffy	I was just making sure it wasn't me; those are armature bones that Blender imports from 3DS Max, but they're converted into objects with no use
2016-02-08 22:35:22	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-08 22:35:26	Scruffy	Which is fine; I just wanted to make sure Blender was performing that correctly for me
2016-02-08 22:35:36	Neocraftz1553	They are lines for me
2016-02-08 22:35:57	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-02-08 22:36:02	Scruffy	They aren't necessary
2016-02-08 22:36:36	Scruffy	But the empty objects in which the Pikmin models are stored are important, they keep all parts of the model together
2016-02-08 22:36:49	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-08 22:37:52	Neocraftz1553	I just noticed the rock pikmin is chipped in some places
2016-02-08 22:37:59	Scruffy	Right now i'm trying to get hair rendering in Blender to behave so I can render Pikmin Forever's version of a Woolly Bulborb
2016-02-08 22:38:04	Scruffy	Yeah, that was a cool detail

2016-02-08 22:40:29	Neocraftz1553	I made Pikmin Return's version of an Electric gate

2016-02-08 22:43:12	Neocraftz1553	Hello again, Testyo
2016-02-08 22:43:13	Testyo	J: how would I... send a message to die or something
2016-02-08 22:43:14	@Espyo	I was forced to reboot windows by force
2016-02-08 22:43:29	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-02-08 22:43:30	@Espyo	because it crashed because it has absolutely no problem giving a process enough RAM and CPU usage that it can't feed ITSELF
2016-02-08 22:43:43	Neocraftz1553	so thats why its so hyperactive
2016-02-08 22:43:44	@Espyo	the reboot corrupted the databases, so I pulled the backup
2016-02-08 22:44:18	Scruffy	Oh no!
2016-02-08 22:44:18	@Espyo	no, a different process was the one that crashed everything
2016-02-08 22:44:22	@Espyo	now, I'm not a programmer
2016-02-08 22:44:24	@Espyo	but I'd think that
2016-02-08 22:44:35	@Espyo	if a process is asking for more resources than what the system can give
2016-02-08 22:44:41	@Espyo	to the point where the system itself grows resource hungry
2016-02-08 22:44:50	@Espyo	shouldn't there be, oh, I don't know, a check to make sure it doesn't go overboard?
2016-02-08 22:45:03	@Espyo	the operative system should have top priority on resources
2016-02-08 22:45:15	@Espyo	but, I guess that's only true for operative systems
2016-02-08 22:45:24	@Espyo	and not prototypes like windows

2016-02-08 22:50:07	Scruffy	By the way...
2016-02-08 22:50:21	Scruffy	I've been considering trying to create a simple Pikmin-esque game on Unity
2016-02-08 22:50:33	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-08 22:51:15	Scruffy	Except no 100-man army you throw at everything, just two or three people trying to bring things back to a centerpoint in some small-scale environment
2016-02-08 22:51:25	@Espyo	right
2016-02-08 22:51:27	Scruffy	It'd be more based on puzzles than combat
2016-02-08 22:51:32	@Espyo	it's worth trying
2016-02-08 22:51:32	Scruffy	Barely any combat, really
2016-02-08 22:51:35	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-08 22:52:19	@Espyo	also, while waiting for windows to load, I tried Metroid Prime 3 with no extra tanks again, on Phaaze
2016-02-08 22:52:26	@Espyo	it's just not possible
2016-02-08 22:52:31	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-08 22:52:32	@Espyo	I never mashed so quickly in my life until this point
2016-02-08 22:52:39	@Espyo	but that wall monster cannot be defeated on Hypermode difficulty
2016-02-08 22:52:47	@Espyo	well, if I can't go on beyond this point
2016-02-08 22:52:55	@Espyo	I consider this challenge completed
2016-02-08 22:53:03	Scruffy	That's the spirit
2016-02-08 22:53:04	@Espyo	I went as far as the game goes in this difficulty mode
2016-02-08 22:53:20	@Espyo	if I were a bored 13-year old, I could retry over and over
2016-02-08 22:53:44	@Espyo	maybe get past it on my 300th try, only to die out of health because the Leviathan Infant takes a million hits to kill in the European version
2016-02-08 22:53:48	@Espyo	but nowadays, I'm far too busy
2016-02-08 22:53:55	@Espyo	and I'm less lenient about unfairness
2016-02-08 22:54:10	@Espyo	those two factors, the wall monster thing and the Leviathan Infant's HP are completely unfair
2016-02-08 22:54:16	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-02-08 22:54:19	@Espyo	I don't have to go down to the game's level
2016-02-08 22:54:21	@Espyo	so...
2016-02-08 22:54:31	@Espyo	that means I completed all three Prime games with the lowest requirements, sans exploits
2016-02-08 22:54:32	@Espyo	hurray!
2016-02-08 22:54:40	@Espyo	oh, on the hardest difficulty on each
2016-02-08 22:54:48	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-02-08 22:54:53	@Espyo	it's not as awesome as doing a speedrun, but it's still a fun challenge
2016-02-08 22:55:04	@Espyo	plus, not skipping stuff adds some more challenge in certain parts
2016-02-08 22:55:06	Scruffy	I'd say that's an accomplishment, and it's not like the wall monster can disagree
2016-02-08 22:55:17	@Espyo	yes
2016-02-08 22:55:52	@Espyo	well, the Nintendo servers are down, so I can't play online games with anybody

2016-02-08 22:56:10	@Espyo	I WAS playing Carmageddon Reincarnation, but... that was the reason the entire system froze in the first place

2016-02-08 22:56:33	@Espyo	I'm not upset it crashed, I'm upset that windows let itself get crashed by it

2016-02-08 23:10:27	Scruffy	Yeah, I should render it from a different angle
2016-02-08 23:15:50	En_Passant	Oh, I suppose it would be appropriate to gloat about winning the Super Bowl because clearly the performance of some people that live in the same state we do is directly correlated to our quality as humans

2016-02-08 23:48:24	Scruffy	I think italics only work one word at a time
2016-02-08 23:48:29	Scruffy	Which is dumb

2016-02-08 23:49:04	En_Passant	Actually, Character D hasn't even been removed yet
2016-02-08 23:49:10	@Espyo	hah, awesome

2016-02-08 23:53:20	@PikFan	hi
2016-02-08 23:53:37	Scruffy	Hi PikFan!
2016-02-08 23:53:43	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-08 23:53:55	@PikFan	so I think Pikifan4 needs a serious talking-to
2016-02-08 23:54:29	@PikFan	I saw that edit where he says the Distant Tundra is the Distant Spring
2016-02-08 23:54:45	@PikFan	...how stupid can this guy get?
2016-02-08 23:55:08	@PikFan	just...wow
2016-02-08 23:55:58	@Espyo	half of his talk page edits are unsigned
2016-02-08 23:56:03	@Espyo	half of his talk page edits are on old topics
2016-02-08 23:56:09	@Espyo	half of his normal edits get reverted for being idiotic
2016-02-08 23:56:10	@Espyo	ugh
2016-02-08 23:56:19	@Espyo	like I said before on this chat, we can talk to him about not signing
2016-02-08 23:56:24	@Espyo	even maybe necrobumping
2016-02-08 23:56:31	@Espyo	but we can't talk to him about edit quality
2016-02-08 23:56:39	@Espyo	it's not something you can say "make better edits"
2016-02-08 23:56:44	@Espyo	and he understands and complies
2016-02-08 23:57:27	@PikFan	I don't see why we can't tell him his edits aren't constructive
2016-02-08 23:57:38	@Espyo	what would he do to fix it?
2016-02-08 23:58:45	@PikFan	well, it's partly to discourage him from even editing in the first place, because none of them are useful, and we're better off not wasting time to correct thos
2016-02-08 23:58:55	@PikFan	*those
2016-02-09 00:00:21	@PikFan	I mean, we can't outright say "stop editing"
2016-02-09 00:00:30	@Espyo	some are
2016-02-09 00:00:45	@Espyo	we're understaffed, and I'd honestly prefer us having a few good edits and a few bad edits
2016-02-09 00:00:48	@Espyo	than us having no edits
2016-02-09 00:00:53	@Espyo	the bad ones can be reverted easily
2016-02-09 00:00:56	@Espyo	(plus they give a good giggle)
2016-02-09 00:01:16	@PikFan	I guess so, but they become old after a while
2016-02-09 00:01:56	@PikFan	understaffed? I thought the Pikmin Wiki admins became admins again?
2016-02-09 00:02:12	@PikFan	...then again, they don't do anything...
2016-02-09 00:02:27	@Espyo	staff as in people who edit
2016-02-09 00:02:31	@Espyo	not as in people who are... staff
2016-02-09 00:02:39	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-02-09 00:03:20	@PikFan	okay, but which of his edits are good? my impression of him is that he doesn't make any
2016-02-09 00:03:35	@Espyo	[[Special:Contributions/Pikifan4]]

2016-02-09 00:04:06	@Espyo	a few of these were never reverted
2016-02-09 00:04:34	@PikFan	I immediately saw the Oak edit
2016-02-09 00:05:30	@PikFan	well, he definitely needs to be talked to...
2016-02-09 00:05:35	@PikFan	anyway
2016-02-09 00:05:55	@PikFan	Scruffy: I like the Feathered Bulborb picture!
2016-02-09 00:06:04	En_Passant	We could try constructive criticism
2016-02-09 00:06:10	@PikFan	it's based off of a peacock, right?
2016-02-09 00:06:15	Scruffy	thanks
2016-02-09 00:06:19	@PikFan	hi En_Passant
2016-02-09 00:06:20	Scruffy	A parrot
2016-02-09 00:06:23	En_Passant	hi
2016-02-09 00:06:29	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-02-09 00:06:30	En_Passant	Yeah, got the parrot impression myself
2016-02-09 00:06:33	En_Passant	What does it do?
2016-02-09 00:06:41	@PikFan	I was kinda close then
2016-02-09 00:06:47	Scruffy	Well for starters, its beak prevents pikmin attacks
2016-02-09 00:07:00	Scruffy	And its eyes are also thicker-skinned, so it cannot be stunned like other Bulborbs
2016-02-09 00:07:32	Scruffy	Pikmin can attack the feathers, and when the Bulborb shakes it ruffles its feathers, giving it a more powerful shaking force
2016-02-09 00:07:51	Scruffy	It sleeps normally, but when awoken it will peck at Pikmin like a Snagret
2016-02-09 00:08:03	Scruffy	quickly, but one at a time
2016-02-09 00:08:17	@PikFan	does it lose its feathers like the Shaggy Long Legs loses its hair?
2016-02-09 00:08:43	@PikFan	except without attacking joints of course
2016-02-09 00:09:22	Scruffy	I think it will, but then again I have a version of a Hairy Bulborb
2016-02-09 00:09:31	Scruffy	It might lose a few, but not all
2016-02-09 00:09:39	@PikFan	hm, I see
2016-02-09 00:12:10	Scruffy	And right now I'm making a Woolly Bulborb
2016-02-09 00:12:16	Scruffy	It's about to go final-render
2016-02-09 00:12:23	En_Passant	Woolly?
2016-02-09 00:12:27	@PikFan	nice
2016-02-09 00:12:39	Scruffy	It's like a Hairy, but it can electrify its hairs
2016-02-09 00:12:40	@PikFan	is that the Hairy Bulborb variant?
2016-02-09 00:12:45	Scruffy	Yes
2016-02-09 00:12:49	@PikFan	oh
2016-02-09 00:13:00	@PikFan	just like the Bearded Amprat
2016-02-09 00:13:28	Scruffy	Yeah... I'm still deciding whether I want to keep the BA as well or give the Woolly Bulborb a different trait
2016-02-09 00:15:15	@PikFan	hmm... kinda far-fetched, but could you salvage to use its wool for something?
2016-02-09 00:15:37	@PikFan	*salvage its wool to use it for something
2016-02-09 00:15:45	Scruffy	Maybeee...
2016-02-09 00:15:52	Scruffy	That's an interesting idea
2016-02-09 00:15:58	Scruffy	Perhaps to use as a climbing material
2016-02-09 00:16:45	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-09 00:17:27	Scruffy	I really only made it Woolly instead of Hairy because I discovered a great modifier for hair particles on blender
2016-02-09 00:17:43	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-09 00:19:03	@PikFan	oh, so I've been thinking about my story
2016-02-09 00:19:33	Scruffy	Oh, hold that thoguh
2016-02-09 00:19:35	Scruffy	thought
2016-02-09 00:19:37	Scruffy	be right back
2016-02-09 00:19:38	@PikFan	well, considering I want the worlds to be opposites of each other, —
2016-02-09 00:19:43	@PikFan	okay
2016-02-09 00:20:12	@PikFan	actually, be right back, gonna get a pot going for some ramen
2016-02-09 00:21:25	@PikFan	back
2016-02-09 00:22:19	Scruffy	back
2016-02-09 00:22:51	@PikFan	hi
2016-02-09 00:23:02	@PikFan	ok, so about my story:
2016-02-09 00:23:42	@PikFan	well, considering I want the worlds to be opposites of each other, I figured that can be applied to the Pikmin society of each world
2016-02-09 00:24:04	@PikFan	we've got a Pikmin Republic in one world
2016-02-09 00:24:25	@PikFan	but in the other, it's just a bunch of tribes with no central government
2016-02-09 00:24:46	Scruffy	Okay
2016-02-09 00:24:54	Scruffy	Do they not follow Onions in the other world?
2016-02-09 00:25:10	@PikFan	they don't even have Onions
2016-02-09 00:25:42	@PikFan	which also brings into play the Pikmin vs Onion conflict for the canon Pikmin
2016-02-09 00:26:03	@PikFan	so anyway, they go to the parallel world, seeking help
2016-02-09 00:26:14	@PikFan	but there's no organization
2016-02-09 00:26:31	@PikFan	so one of the big challenges is getting that organization
2016-02-09 00:26:33	@PikFan	brb
2016-02-09 00:27:39	Scruffy	I see
2016-02-09 00:28:08	Scruffy	I'll brb as well
2016-02-09 00:31:40	@PikFan	back
2016-02-09 00:32:19	@PikFan	okay, so the main reason the Pikmin tribes aren't together is because they see no reason to
2016-02-09 00:32:51	@PikFan	some don't know of other tribes' existence
2016-02-09 00:32:58	@PikFan	some dislike each other
2016-02-09 00:33:13	@PikFan	but really, they just don't need to be unified
2016-02-09 00:33:38	@PikFan	each tribe thrives on its own, independent of other tribes
2016-02-09 00:34:03	@PikFan	they're not actively hunted, and they have plenty of food
2016-02-09 00:34:17	@PikFan	so they're more primitive in nature
2016-02-09 00:35:37	Scruffy	back
2016-02-09 00:35:49	Scruffy	Rigth
2016-02-09 00:36:01	Scruffy	Right*
2016-02-09 00:37:36	@PikFan	so, as you can expect, when the canon Pikmin appear, it starts disrupting that peaceful state of things
2016-02-09 00:37:55	@PikFan	there's a lot of confusion and hesitation
2016-02-09 00:38:01	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-09 00:38:58	@PikFan	even worse, some enemies also cross over
2016-02-09 00:39:03	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-02-09 00:39:18	@PikFan	so things really start taking a turn for the worse
2016-02-09 00:39:53	Scruffy	That sounds fun
2016-02-09 00:40:02	@PikFan	some of the parallel Pikmin blame the canon Pikmin for this turn of events
2016-02-09 00:40:19	@PikFan	so it gets quite messy

2016-02-09 00:41:20	@PikFan	but somehow, I think the Canons manage to organize the Parallels, and they start their counterattack
2016-02-09 00:41:57	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-02-09 00:41:59	Scruffy	On whom?
2016-02-09 00:42:07	Scruffy	The mysterious magical villian?
2016-02-09 00:42:14	@PikFan	yes
2016-02-09 00:42:14	Scruffy	Is he going to make himself known?
2016-02-09 00:42:21	@PikFan	as well as his army
2016-02-09 00:42:24	@PikFan	oh yes
2016-02-09 00:42:25	Scruffy	Nice
2016-02-09 00:42:29	@PikFan	yes he will
2016-02-09 00:42:35	Scruffy	His army!?
2016-02-09 00:42:49	Scruffy	I thought Pikmin were the only army in Pikmin, besides Scornets
2016-02-09 00:43:28	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-09 00:43:34	@PikFan	hang on, brb
2016-02-09 00:44:28	@PikFan	okay, so here's the map of the Canon's world: http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/d/d6/Pangaeaultima_a.gtx.png
2016-02-09 00:45:06	@PikFan	I see the Republic occupying the western half, and the enemy forces occuyping the eastern half
2016-02-09 00:46:10	@PikFan	the enemy forces invade from the northern strip of land and take over the Republic, following the coup
2016-02-09 00:46:18	Scruffy	hm
2016-02-09 00:47:00	@PikFan	outnumbered, the Pikmin flee in their Onions to the Portal, located on the island in the very center
2016-02-09 00:47:38	Scruffy	the Formidable Oak island?
2016-02-09 00:47:44	@PikFan	yup
2016-02-09 00:48:06	Scruffy	might that have something to do with the Portal's existence?
2016-02-09 00:48:12	@PikFan	and, surprise surprise—they run into the Plasm Wraith
2016-02-09 00:49:27	@PikFan	so that happens, but then they manage to cross the Portal
2016-02-09 00:50:11	@PikFan	so... I'm not sure how the Parallel's world should be designed
2016-02-09 00:50:30	@PikFan	I'll probably just draw some random landmass
2016-02-09 00:50:39	@PikFan	or landmasses
2016-02-09 00:50:42	@PikFan	not sure
2016-02-09 00:50:59	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-02-09 00:51:02	Scruffy	If you really wanted to go crazy, the surface of the reverse world would be the /interior/ of a planet
2016-02-09 00:51:13	@PikFan	woah
2016-02-09 00:51:32	En_Passant	gravity says no, unless this parallel world has its own physics

2016-02-09 00:51:50	Scruffy	yeah
2016-02-09 00:52:01	Scruffy	I was just jumping to wild conclusions
2016-02-09 00:52:15	@PikFan	for the sake of simplicity, I think I'll stay with a normal world
2016-02-09 00:52:25	@PikFan	radical idea though, I like it
2016-02-09 00:53:28	@PikFan	oh, En_Passant, what do you think of my ideas, all clichè-ness aside?
2016-02-09 00:57:48	En_Passant	No offense, but what part the story isn't part of the clichè-ness?

2016-02-09 01:07:32	Scruffy	bye
2016-02-09 01:45:04	En_Passant	So I've decided that I'm going to have a series that's video game cartridges
2016-02-09 01:45:59	En_Passant	I just need to decide on games to represent each Nintendo console
2016-02-09 01:46:16	Scruffy	Ooh, neat
2016-02-09 01:46:37	Scruffy	What about video game cartridges? Reviewing them?
2016-02-09 01:46:47	En_Passant	No, treasure series
2016-02-09 01:46:55	Scruffy	Oh oh oh sorry
2016-02-09 01:46:56	Scruffy	Haha
2016-02-09 01:47:06	Scruffy	I thought you meant like a series of videos
2016-02-09 01:47:23	En_Passant	Scruffy plz, I couldn't do something like that
2016-02-09 01:47:42	Scruffy	Aww come on, you can do anything you put your mind too
2016-02-09 01:47:44	Scruffy	to*
2016-02-09 01:47:59	Scruffy	After all, you're in the self-proclaimed greatest state in the US
2016-02-09 01:48:51	Scruffy	But that's neat, does that also include discs?
2016-02-09 01:49:51	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-02-09 01:50:06	Scruffy	Cool
2016-02-09 01:51:42	Scruffy	Mario Sunshine would make a good representative GameCube game
2016-02-09 01:52:25	En_Passant	It would?
2016-02-09 01:53:36	Scruffy	It's sold over 5 million copies and everyone has generally enjoyed it
2016-02-09 01:53:48	Scruffy	Plus it's Mario, Nintendo's titular character
2016-02-09 01:54:09	Scruffy	If not that Mario game, then Super Mario 64 for the SNES
2016-02-09 02:07:15	En_Passant	Well, remember that they wouldn't know that
2016-02-09 02:07:32	En_Passant	Also, iirc Sunshine was one of the worst selling Mario games
2016-02-09 02:08:00	Scruffy	oh
2016-02-09 02:08:55	En_Passant	it was lots of fun though :p
2016-02-09 02:09:22	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-02-09 02:10:39	En_Passant	I looked at the Metal Index because I couldn't remember if you already did that
2016-02-09 02:10:45	En_Passant	What's this about a Postponer?
2016-02-09 02:11:40	Scruffy	It gives you the option of extending the day for another minute and a half, while that minute and a half is spent at night. It
2016-02-09 02:11:52	Scruffy	It's for those times when you almost got a treasure back but not quite
2016-02-09 02:12:08	En_Passant	oh yeah, you mentioned something about that
2016-02-09 02:12:16	En_Passant	Either that, or PikFan did
2016-02-09 02:12:18	Scruffy	During the minute and a half enemies would become /much/ more active
2016-02-09 02:12:38	Scruffy	Bulborbs would awake, enemies would move around more and more actively hunt Pikmin
2016-02-09 02:12:58	En_Passant	Would that be a menu option?
2016-02-09 02:13:01	Scruffy	Yes
2016-02-09 02:13:09	Scruffy	But I don't think I'd force it upon you
2016-02-09 02:13:30	En_Passant	What do you mean?
2016-02-09 02:13:42	Scruffy	Like, it might be available all day, and during the final countdown it would remind you that you can
2016-02-09 02:13:48	En_Passant	Oh
2016-02-09 02:13:50	Scruffy	Rather than forcing you to choose at the end of the day
2016-02-09 02:14:11	En_Passant	I was thinking it could replace the Go to Sunset option once the countdown starts
2016-02-09 02:14:35	Scruffy	That could work, yeah
2016-02-09 02:14:47	Scruffy	Since they wouldn't choose to extend the day in the middle of the day
2016-02-09 02:14:53	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-02-09 02:15:00	Scruffy	Cool
2016-02-09 02:15:15	Scruffy	But yeah, unlike PikFan's version, this does not take time out of the next day
2016-02-09 02:15:23	Scruffy	It's just risky because of enemy activity
2016-02-09 02:15:35	En_Passant	Unless they're all dead
2016-02-09 02:15:47	En_Passant	Though you could just spawn more offscreen if that was the case
2016-02-09 02:16:22	Scruffy	Haha if I were so cruel
2016-02-09 02:16:56	En_Passant	It's not cruel. It makes sure the downside of extending your day isn't circumventable
2016-02-09 02:17:17	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-09 02:17:26	Scruffy	I might as well have enemies burrowing out of the ground
2016-02-09 02:17:29	Scruffy	Like zombies
2016-02-09 02:18:13	En_Passant	You know what would be cruel? Having a night-exclusive enemy
2016-02-09 02:18:39	En_Passant	People who choose not to use the function will be screwed on their Piklopedia
2016-02-09 02:18:54	Scruffy	Yeheah
2016-02-09 02:19:18	Scruffy	Do you mind helping me come up with one?
2016-02-09 02:19:35	En_Passant	uuhhhh
2016-02-09 02:19:43	En_Passant	I'm not very good at that, but sure
2016-02-09 02:21:16	En_Passant	Maybe something scorpion-like
2016-02-09 02:21:25	En_Passant	They burrow during the day and come out at night
2016-02-09 02:21:38	En_Passant	Plus, they're pretty intimidating
2016-02-09 02:21:46	Scruffy	Yeha
2016-02-09 02:22:43	Scruffy	I guess, would they strike at Pikmin?
2016-02-09 02:23:01	Scruffy	That'd be a little brutal, although nothing new for the Joustmite/Burrow-nit
2016-02-09 02:24:31	Scruffy	Perhaps just as the Burrow nit is a reverse horseshoe crab, this enemy could be a reverse scorpion
2016-02-09 02:24:41	Scruffy	And have its head on its stinging bit
2016-02-09 02:25:21	Scruffy	So you'd want to get behind it in order to cause damage on its body
2016-02-09 02:25:59	En_Passant	Its head on its stinging bit
2016-02-09 02:26:03	En_Passant	I'm trying to imagine that
2016-02-09 02:29:32	Scruffy	It'd be kinda like a insecty Snagret but with an exoskeletal body behind it
2016-02-09 02:29:40	Scruffy	That... doesn't really help

2016-02-09 02:34:50	Scruffy	this is an enemy from the original Ratchet and Clank game that provides the closest similarity to what I'm imagining

2016-02-09 02:36:36	En_Passant	Oh, I see
2016-02-09 02:43:24	Scruffy	So yeah, something like that would start burrowing up everywhere
2016-02-09 02:43:43	Scruffy	Should you be able to end the day once the postponement is in effect?
2016-02-09 02:53:59	Scruffy	I don't think you should
2016-02-09 02:54:42	Scruffy	But then again, if you can just go back to any day and start again, you might as well be able to 
2016-02-09 02:56:01	En_Passant	I guess so
2016-02-09 03:14:06	Scruffy	uploaded a less creepy Red bulborb angle
2016-02-09 03:14:33	Scruffy	Hopefully that did the trick; I tried to show its spots while still getting its whole form
2016-02-09 03:16:00	Scruffy	And now the Woolly Bulborb's done!

2016-02-09 18:05:42	@Espyo	Dropbox public folder downloads are always the same URL
2016-02-09 18:05:45	@Espyo	they just change the filename

2016-02-09 18:08:59	@Espyo	ok, this can take anywhere from 3 minutes to 13

2016-02-09 18:09:24	Neocraftz1553	Hey espyo, what format are the files for P3
2016-02-09 18:09:38	@Espyo	well, almost all files use formats made by Nintendo
2016-02-09 18:09:44	@Espyo	models are in the .bbfres format
2016-02-09 18:10:06	@Espyo	sorry, .bfres
2016-02-09 18:10:16	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-02-09 18:10:25	Neocraftz1553	do you know how to open .szs?
2016-02-09 18:10:30	@Espyo	mhm
2016-02-09 18:10:51	Neocraftz1553	with what program?
2016-02-09 18:10:52	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56043942/Programs/WiiUHackingTools/SARCExtract-0.4.py
2016-02-09 18:10:57	@Espyo	it's a Python script
2016-02-09 18:11:03	@Espyo	for that, you'll need to install Python 2.7
2016-02-09 18:11:03	Neocraftz1553	for .szs?
2016-02-09 18:11:07	@Espyo	and run it through the command line
2016-02-09 18:11:10	Neocraftz1553	windows?
2016-02-09 18:11:12	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-09 18:11:26	@Espyo	it's tricky if you're not quite sure how to use the command line
2016-02-09 18:11:31	@Espyo	but if you do, it's pretty simple

2016-02-09 18:11:59	Neocraftz1553	is that for .szs files? or...
2016-02-09 18:12:10	@Espyo	it's for .szs files, yes
2016-02-09 18:12:14	@Espyo	it does say SARC
2016-02-09 18:12:18	@Espyo	but it's .szs
2016-02-09 18:12:21	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-02-09 18:12:28	@Espyo	it also opens .arc files
2016-02-09 18:12:31	@Espyo	the two types are very similar

2016-02-09 18:12:44	@Espyo	also normally .arc files are inside .szs files, so it's like they're one and the same, almost
2016-02-09 18:12:59	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-09 18:13:08	Neocraftz1553	so its like zipping a zip file
2016-02-09 18:14:45	@Espyo	pretty much
2016-02-09 18:14:51	Neocraftz1553	alright
2016-02-09 18:16:17	Neocraftz1553	the .dds files are the textures for the object, right?
2016-02-09 18:16:28	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-09 18:16:47	@Espyo	it might be hard to see what the texture is if you don't have a good image viewer installed
2016-02-09 18:17:01	@Espyo	see, dds files are common in the industry, so it's not like it's a Nintendo-made format that only a few tools support
2016-02-09 18:17:03	Neocraftz1553	DDS viewer
2016-02-09 18:17:11	Neocraftz1553	crashes and stuff :b
2016-02-09 18:17:12	@Espyo	but it's not SO common that stuff like windows' photo viewer can open them
2016-02-09 18:17:15	@Espyo	it does? yikes
2016-02-09 18:17:23	@Espyo	well, as long as Blender doesn't crash, I guess that works, right?
2016-02-09 18:17:36	Neocraftz1553	I guess, I need to try
2016-02-09 18:17:52	Neocraftz1553	I actually retextured the Pikmin
2016-02-09 18:18:10	@Espyo	Scruffy uses the .dds I send him just fine
2016-02-09 18:18:11	@Espyo	so it should work
2016-02-09 18:18:15	@Espyo	but let me know if it doesn't
2016-02-09 18:19:02	Neocraftz1553	I see...
2016-02-09 18:19:05	Neocraftz1553	yup, they work
2016-02-09 18:19:13	Neocraftz1553	They are just like regular images

2016-02-09 20:33:54	@PikFan	don't know why, it just was
2016-02-09 20:36:01	@PikFan	oh, Espyo:
2016-02-09 20:36:09	@PikFan	so I hit level 40 the other day in Splatoon
2016-02-09 20:36:19	@PikFan	also got A+ in ranked
2016-02-09 20:36:25	@Espyo	good grief, you're growing fast
2016-02-09 20:36:28	@PikFan	I think this is my limit though
2016-02-09 20:36:38	@PikFan	these S ranked people... I'm scared
2016-02-09 20:36:46	@Espyo	you're pretty close to S, though
2016-02-09 20:36:49	@Espyo	once you go S, you don't go back
2016-02-09 20:36:50	@PikFan	I know
2016-02-09 20:36:51	@Espyo	literally
2016-02-09 20:37:01	@Espyo	the game locks you in the S field forever
2016-02-09 20:37:06	@PikFan	why?
2016-02-09 20:37:08	@Espyo	you only go between S- and S+ from there on
2016-02-09 20:37:10	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-02-09 20:37:14	Neocraftz15532	heh
2016-02-09 20:37:20	@PikFan	I thought S- wasn't a thing
2016-02-09 20:37:27	@Espyo	or S and S+
2016-02-09 20:37:28	@PikFan	I thought it was just S and S+
2016-02-09 20:37:35	@Espyo	iunno, I don't play Ranked often
2016-02-09 20:37:38	@Espyo	(gee, wonder why)
2016-02-09 20:37:42	@PikFan	correction: at all
2016-02-09 20:37:51	@Espyo	(I wonder if it's because of the non-existent weapon balance or because lag speaks higher than your own skill)
2016-02-09 20:38:00	@PikFan	(hah)
2016-02-09 20:38:19	@PikFan	(I'm probably growing really fast because of ranked)
2016-02-09 20:38:22	<--	Neocraftz15532 (Mibbit@206.78.wr.nm) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-02-09 20:38:22	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-02-09 20:38:37	@PikFan	well, I guess being locked in S is convenient
2016-02-09 20:38:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-09 20:38:56	@PikFan	but at the same time, it means I always have to endure the other S ranked users' wrath
2016-02-09 20:39:08	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-02-09 20:39:14	@PikFan	heh, I had an idea some days ago
2016-02-09 20:39:34	En_Passant	Splatoon's not balanced?
2016-02-09 20:39:41	@PikFan	my idea is to erase my save file so that I instantly go back to being a level 1
2016-02-09 20:40:03	@PikFan	but because I'm...experienced, I'd just knock over all those other low levels
2016-02-09 20:40:18	@PikFan	En_Passant: eeeehhhhhhhh...
2016-02-09 20:40:30	@PikFan	chargers definitely aren't
2016-02-09 20:40:40	@PikFan	Espyo was ranting about them some time ago
2016-02-09 20:40:41	@Espyo	chargers and the Gal Decos
2016-02-09 20:40:44	@PikFan	and now I see why
2016-02-09 20:41:03	@PikFan	my main issue with them is their FREAKING INCREDIBLE AIM
2016-02-09 20:41:10	@Espyo	it makes sense that some weapons exist for taking out the opponents
2016-02-09 20:41:17	@Espyo	it's just as viable a mechanic as inking
2016-02-09 20:41:17	@PikFan	that's also partly because of lag, but still...
2016-02-09 20:41:32	@Espyo	but when you have people that don't ink the terrain often because they keep sniping
2016-02-09 20:41:42	@Espyo	and you have the other team spending half of their play time dead...
2016-02-09 20:41:45	@Espyo	it's fun for nobody
2016-02-09 20:41:58	@Espyo	the players on the other team are frustrated because they want to play, but keep dying
2016-02-09 20:42:02	@Espyo	and looking at the long kill cam
2016-02-09 20:42:06	@Espyo	and looking at the long respawn sequence
2016-02-09 20:42:09	@Espyo	and looking at the long super jump
2016-02-09 20:42:16	@Espyo	only to have it repeat again because the sniper's too good
2016-02-09 20:42:20	@PikFan	only to get splatted again
2016-02-09 20:42:25	En_Passant	Sniping's a good job, mate
2016-02-09 20:42:32	En_Passant	*sips coffee*
2016-02-09 20:42:35	@Espyo	and the players on the other team have a bad time because while their sniper's taking out the opposition, they're not inking much
2016-02-09 20:42:37	@PikFan	only if you have excellent aim
2016-02-09 20:42:44	@Espyo	so the teams with snipers end up losing a great majority of the time
2016-02-09 20:42:47	@Espyo	it's fun for NOBODY
2016-02-09 20:42:51	@Espyo	except the sniper, I guess
2016-02-09 20:42:52	@PikFan	which I don't, so screw sniping
2016-02-09 20:43:04	@PikFan	I love taking out snipers
2016-02-09 20:43:22	@PikFan	I just love getting my revenge on them
2016-02-09 20:43:47	@PikFan	but yeah, laggy snipers are awful
2016-02-09 20:44:03	@PikFan	the second I see their red beam of death, I get splatted
2016-02-09 20:44:09	@PikFan	I have no
2016-02-09 20:44:09	@PikFan	time
2016-02-09 20:44:11	@PikFan	to
2016-02-09 20:44:12	@PikFan	react
2016-02-09 20:44:22	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-09 20:44:33	@Espyo	worst is when I'm being sneaky and agile, swooshing left and right
2016-02-09 20:44:35	@Espyo	there's no way they can get me
2016-02-09 20:44:42	@Espyo	or I hide in the ink and become unpredictable with my paths
2016-02-09 20:44:51	@PikFan	but somehow, they still get you?
2016-02-09 20:45:02	@Espyo	but wouldn't you know my luck, I happen to be facing off against the only human in the history of mankind that has clairvoyance
2016-02-09 20:45:28	@PikFan	you mean inkling
2016-02-09 20:45:34	@PikFan	/sarcasm
2016-02-09 20:45:40	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-02-09 20:45:44	@Espyo	that works too
2016-02-09 20:46:07	@PikFan	it especially sucks when their team is winning, so you can't get past them at all
2016-02-09 20:46:14	@Espyo	yeha
2016-02-09 20:46:15	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-02-09 20:46:18	@PikFan	"oh, you're trying to get past me? sorry, no"
2016-02-09 20:46:48	@PikFan	bombs are effective though
2016-02-09 20:47:10	@PikFan	especially suction bombs because of their delayed explosion
2016-02-09 20:47:15	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-09 20:47:33	@PikFan	in ranked I use the custom dual squelcher, so I have to use burst bombs, so that's fine
2016-02-09 20:48:20	@PikFan	I just really hate it when I try chasing someone with the kraken but then they splat me when it's used up... I hate getting tricked like that
2016-02-09 20:49:48	@PikFan	Espyo, what are you looking for in Splatoon 2?
2016-02-09 20:50:45	@Espyo	a team that knows how to work with online
2016-02-09 20:50:50	@Espyo	Octolings
2016-02-09 20:51:03	@Espyo	and a psychology team dedicated to anti-annoyance features
2016-02-09 20:51:11	@Espyo	that's all, really
2016-02-09 20:51:14	@Espyo	well, more single-player support
2016-02-09 20:51:28	@PikFan	more local support
2016-02-09 20:51:28	@Espyo	I wish there was a training mode where you fight off Octolings like they appear in single-player
2016-02-09 20:51:40	@Espyo	they're far from being human-like, but it's better than nothing
2016-02-09 20:51:48	@PikFan	*more local multiplayer support
2016-02-09 20:52:14	@PikFan	also, more variety in stages
2016-02-09 20:52:34	@Espyo	the existing stages are pretty good and varied
2016-02-09 20:52:36	@PikFan	how many maps are there now? 15...?
2016-02-09 20:52:38	@Espyo	but of course, a sequel should bring more
2016-02-09 20:53:03	@PikFan	also, I want to explore more of Inkopolis
2016-02-09 20:53:09	@PikFan	that's a must
2016-02-09 20:53:38	@Espyo	hey, yeah
2016-02-09 20:53:44	@PikFan	I mean, I know the game isn't really centered around exploration, but still...
2016-02-09 20:53:55	@PikFan	I feel like there's potential there
2016-02-09 20:54:21	@Espyo	definitely
2016-02-09 20:54:46	@PikFan	also, on the topic of local multiplayer: bring in friends to places like Octo Valley to take on more challenging missions
2016-02-09 20:55:08	@PikFan	not required at all, but I think it could be fun
2016-02-09 20:55:48	@PikFan	okay, gotta go, I'll most likely be on tomorrow around this time
2016-02-09 20:55:50	@PikFan	bye
2016-02-09 20:55:52	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@fxpw-848-69.shs.lane.edu) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-09 20:57:01	Yoshi2	would require some work to make fun coop missions though
2016-02-09 20:58:30	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-09 20:59:26	Yoshi2	in other news, I'm using this extra time to fix some stuff up in my project, but I'm not really making as much progress as I hoped
2016-02-09 20:59:38	Yoshi2	still a bunch of things that don't work
2016-02-09 20:59:46	Yoshi2	and some things that refuse to work
2016-02-09 21:03:07	@Espyo	ugh
2016-02-09 21:03:53	Yoshi2	I swear if I didn't see the code from other people, I'd say the tlcd is broken
2016-02-09 21:05:54	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@206.78.wr.nm) has joined #pikipedia
2016-02-09 21:06:07	Neocraftz1553	Evening, Testyo
2016-02-09 21:06:09	Testyo	ok i checked the recent changes and came upon this edit
2016-02-09 21:06:17	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-09 21:06:32	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo
2016-02-09 21:06:39	Neocraftz1553	The Download did work
2016-02-09 21:06:42	Neocraftz1553	and the models
2016-02-09 21:06:46	@Espyo	nice
2016-02-09 21:06:49	@Espyo	can you work with them well?
2016-02-09 21:06:51	@Espyo	they look like chaos
2016-02-09 21:06:59	Neocraftz1553	they are all good...
2016-02-09 21:07:17	@Espyo	but...?
2016-02-09 21:07:24	Neocraftz1553	but the Gate Positions are a bit off by... alot
2016-02-09 21:07:44	Neocraftz1553	I'll have to reposition them, but besides that, they look good
2016-02-09 21:08:39	Neocraftz1553	The Gate thingys on the sides
2016-02-09 21:08:59	Neocraftz1553	aka, the rusty screws and metal bars on the crystal gate
2016-02-09 21:09:13	Neocraftz1553	and the Dirt sandcastle on the Dirt Wall
2016-02-09 21:09:18	Testyo	@sw the plot in P4?
2016-02-09 21:09:26	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm
2016-02-09 21:09:27	Testyo	I said @sw the plot in P4? because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages @sw and what if that's just the plot in P4?.
2016-02-09 21:09:35	@Espyo	I'm afraid there's not much I can do
2016-02-09 21:09:41	Neocraftz1553	Its fine
2016-02-09 21:09:51	Neocraftz1553	I can just drag them up
2016-02-09 21:09:54	@Espyo	well, good
2016-02-09 21:10:21	Neocraftz1553	hey, how frequent are Testyo's timed messages
2016-02-09 21:10:27	Testyo	so I just request a notebook to jot all these ideas down
2016-02-09 21:10:35	@Espyo	Testyo: stats
2016-02-09 21:10:37	Testyo	Stats: http://89.153.95.36:8080/Pikipedia/stats
2016-02-09 21:11:13	@Espyo	randomly every 10800 to 14400 seconds
2016-02-09 21:11:17	@Espyo	whatever that means
2016-02-09 21:11:30	@Espyo	 3 to 4 hours, I think
2016-02-09 21:11:42	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-02-09 21:12:22	Neocraftz1553	 4 hours
2016-02-09 21:12:25	Neocraftz1553	I think...
2016-02-09 21:12:41	Neocraftz1553	you can't make him say them more frquent?
2016-02-09 21:12:50	@Espyo	I can, but it becomes annoying
2016-02-09 21:13:00	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-02-09 21:13:02	@Espyo	he used to have them super frequent back when I added that feature
2016-02-09 21:13:05	@Espyo	like, every 10 minutes
2016-02-09 21:13:07	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-09 21:13:07	@Espyo	then it was annoying
2016-02-09 21:13:12	@Espyo	then I moved it to like every 30
2016-02-09 21:13:14	@Espyo	too annoying
2016-02-09 21:13:15	@Espyo	every hour?
2016-02-09 21:13:16	Neocraftz1553	how about every hour
2016-02-09 21:13:19	@Espyo	still too annoying
2016-02-09 21:13:29	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-09 21:13:30	@Espyo	I could give it a try again, though
2016-02-09 21:13:35	@Espyo	all in favor?
2016-02-09 21:13:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-09 21:13:53	Neocraftz1553	Hello, En_Passant
2016-02-09 21:14:09	Neocraftz1553	I always forget he's even here :b
2016-02-09 21:14:17	Yoshi2	I'm against it :>
2016-02-09 21:14:24	Neocraftz1553	eh ok
2016-02-09 21:14:27	Yoshi2	you can trigger the same thing by saying his name
2016-02-09 21:14:28	@Espyo	>:
2016-02-09 21:14:32	@Espyo	yeah, pretty much
2016-02-09 21:14:56	Neocraftz1553	yeah, but I'm not going to say his name every hour :v
2016-02-09 21:15:18	Yoshi2	don't be lazy :v
2016-02-09 21:15:24	Neocraftz1553	He whose name should not be mentioned :b
2016-02-09 21:15:38	Neocraftz1553	or else he'll say the first thing that comes to his mind
2016-02-09 21:16:00	Yoshi2	Testyo: wow, did you hear that?
2016-02-09 21:16:01	Testyo	which was because of the same time
2016-02-09 21:16:16	Neocraftz1553	really, Testyo :b
2016-02-09 21:16:17	Testyo	some sort of dark red color, to counter the client can't answer questions for their life
2016-02-09 21:16:24	Neocraftz1553	hehe
2016-02-09 21:16:41	Neocraftz1553	yesterday it was a dark red color to counter Germany
2016-02-09 21:16:49	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm
2016-02-09 21:16:50	Testyo	I said some sort of dark red color, to counter the client can't answer questions for their life because Neocraftz1553 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages ...specially because the client can't answer questions for their life and some sort of dark red color, to counter the normal pink. They were joined by the common word the.
2016-02-09 21:17:13	Neocraftz1553	wow
2016-02-09 21:17:30	Neocraftz1553	dark red colors counter everything, apparently
2016-02-09 21:20:00	En_Passant	dark red colors are the best
2016-02-09 21:20:10	Neocraftz1553	rly?
2016-02-09 21:20:15	Neocraftz1553	rly?
2016-02-09 21:20:30	Neocraftz1553	eh, chat doesn't have dark red
2016-02-09 21:32:17	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-02-09 21:32:18	Testyo	their reply after way too long? "Yes, that's correct. It's two in an obstacle?
2016-02-09 21:34:20	Neocraftz1553	Testyo's can tell the future
2016-02-09 21:34:20	Testyo	it fails less when I use the SMS parser, which means that I made an account at fanfiction.net
2016-02-09 21:34:53	Neocraftz1553	In this case, he knows their reply after way too long
2016-02-09 21:38:43	Yoshi2	the thing failing less clearly means Testyo made an account at fanfiction dot net
2016-02-09 21:38:44	Testyo	yeah, "clash" obviously means it's a parameter you set to be std::max using algorithm?
2016-02-09 21:39:08	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-09 21:39:32	Neocraftz1553	wait, Testyo lm
2016-02-09 21:39:33	Testyo	and yeah, in that sounds like quite a bit of work
2016-02-09 21:39:34	Yoshi2	ok, so the thing I expected to not work in my project actually works
2016-02-09 21:39:48	Yoshi2	and the thing that should work doesn't work (properly)
2016-02-09 21:40:34	Neocraftz1553	reversed roles
2016-02-09 21:40:36	Neocraftz1553	ish

2016-02-09 21:41:12	Yoshi2	(the thing that somehow works is button clicking and drawing, the thing that doesn't work properly is colors)
2016-02-09 21:41:57	Neocraftz1553	oh

2016-02-10 19:18:40	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-02-10 19:18:41	Testyo	the 'infobox' part doesn't actually matter since you could use it elsewhere if you know how, currently, our enemy infoboxes have the global seeds value, the P1-specific seeds value, the P2-specific and P3-specific
2016-02-10 19:19:58	Scruffy	Hi Espyo, Testyo
2016-02-10 19:19:59	Testyo	hm, yeah
2016-02-10 19:26:35	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-10 19:33:03	Scruffy	I don't know if we're going to see En_Passant on here today, but if he does come on and I'm not here, I have to tell him
2016-02-10 19:33:13	Scruffy	I might be a few minutes late on the Skype chat tomorrow
2016-02-10 19:35:02	Scruffy	I have a recital that was at noon, but it got pushed back to 12:45
2016-02-10 19:35:23	Scruffy	So, it won't take too long, but there's a chance I won't make it right at 1
2016-02-10 19:36:00	Yoshi2	mhm, ok
2016-02-10 19:36:07	@Espyo	nuts
2016-02-10 19:36:21	@Espyo	you can send him a memo with Testyo
2016-02-10 19:36:22	Testyo	it helpts that the UI seems to be taken straight from one of the discussion
2016-02-10 19:36:25	@Espyo	but that'd require me being here too
2016-02-10 19:36:47	Yoshi2	so good news about the color issue in my project: I think I can only have 32 different colors anyway
2016-02-10 19:37:06	Yoshi2	I'll just work with that
2016-02-10 19:37:06	Scruffy	I can just email him about it actually
2016-02-10 19:37:13	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-02-10 19:37:17	@Espyo	yeah, might as well e-mail
2016-02-10 19:37:25	@Espyo	uh, just for the record
2016-02-10 19:37:33	@Espyo	it's currently 12:37 where you are, right?
2016-02-10 19:37:38	Scruffy	2:37
2016-02-10 19:37:42	@Espyo	uhm
2016-02-10 19:37:50	@Espyo	ok, let's try this a different way
2016-02-10 19:37:54	@Espyo	in how many hours does the meeting start?
2016-02-10 19:37:55	@Espyo	 24?
2016-02-10 19:38:19	Scruffy	It begins in 22 hours and 22 minutes
2016-02-10 19:38:24	@Espyo	...
2016-02-10 19:38:34	@Espyo	I'm not available at that time
2016-02-10 19:38:38	@Espyo	ugh, timezones
2016-02-10 19:38:48	Scruffy	Wait a minute
2016-02-10 19:38:51	Scruffy	What am I thinking
2016-02-10 19:39:01	Scruffy	It's /his/ 1:00
2016-02-10 19:39:03	Scruffy	My 3:00
2016-02-10 19:39:06	Scruffy	Duh
2016-02-10 19:39:14	@Espyo	oh
2016-02-10 19:39:20	@Espyo	so 23 hours and 20 minutes
2016-02-10 19:39:27	@Espyo	uh, *24 hours and 20 minutes
2016-02-10 19:39:31	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-10 19:39:47	Scruffy	Never mind then, that works out perfect for me
2016-02-10 19:39:48	@Espyo	 20 minutes from now, it'll be at that exact hour, but thursday
2016-02-10 19:39:49	@Espyo	good, good
2016-02-10 19:39:58	@Espyo	oof, glad we got this sorted out
2016-02-10 19:39:59	@Espyo	I
2016-02-10 19:39:59	@Espyo	HATE
2016-02-10 19:40:00	@Espyo	timezones
2016-02-10 19:40:01	@Espyo	so much
2016-02-10 19:40:07	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-10 19:40:41	Scruffy	Sometimes I think we should live a little more like the time calculation of Pikmin and just start the day when the sun rises, end it when it sets
2016-02-10 19:40:48	Scruffy	It's still 12 hours of stuff done
2016-02-10 19:40:59	@Espyo	heh
2016-02-10 19:41:05	Scruffy	But we wouldn't have to worry about hours at all
2016-02-10 19:41:27	Scruffy	Speaking of weird time stuff, I had a weird realization about time in Pikmin 2
2016-02-10 19:41:48	Scruffy	If you were to externally observe Olimar and company entering a cave
2016-02-10 19:41:56	Scruffy	As soon as they enter, they would exit
2016-02-10 19:42:10	Scruffy	Since magnetic fields freeze time outside the cave
2016-02-10 19:42:12	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-10 19:42:31	Scruffy	Which means Louie spends an indefinite amount of time stuck in the Dream Den
2016-02-10 19:42:57	@Espyo	wow, yeah
2016-02-10 19:43:08	Scruffy	It could be decades more than Olimar and the President spend looking for him
2016-02-10 19:43:12	Scruffy	Relatively, of course
2016-02-10 19:43:59	Scruffy	heh, all of the animals in the caves are centuries of cave evolutions
2016-02-10 19:44:16	Scruffy	But really it's best not to think about it too hard
2016-02-10 19:44:56	@Espyo	ugh, yeah
2016-02-10 19:44:58	@Espyo	I never thought about that
2016-02-10 19:44:59	@Espyo	good grief
2016-02-10 19:45:24	Scruffy	Pikmin 2 really is the darkest of the three
2016-02-10 19:45:38	Scruffy	The most cathartic, for sure
2016-02-10 19:47:01	Scruffy	Oh! And I ought to tell you in case I ever have questions
2016-02-10 19:47:15	Scruffy	I have just today gone into planning on developing my own game
2016-02-10 19:47:19	Scruffy	with Unity
2016-02-10 19:47:45	@Espyo	hurray
2016-02-10 19:47:52	@Espyo	I'll try my best to help
2016-02-10 19:47:57	Scruffy	Thank you!
2016-02-10 19:48:12	@Espyo	heck, me, Yoshi2, or J can all help with programming
2016-02-10 19:48:23	@Espyo	and since Unity isn't really any specific thing, any of us is just a good a candidate as any other
2016-02-10 19:48:32	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-10 19:48:36	Scruffy	Thank you very much
2016-02-10 19:48:49	Scruffy	Are you at all familiar with the language "C sharp" ?
2016-02-10 19:49:06	@Espyo	mhm, C#
2016-02-10 19:49:11	Scruffy	Cool
2016-02-10 19:49:23	Scruffy	That's appears to be what Unity encourages
2016-02-10 19:49:23	@Espyo	(it's crap) it's similar to C, which we're pretty familiar with
2016-02-10 19:49:33	Scruffy	Oh
2016-02-10 19:49:46	Scruffy	Well there's also JavaScript
2016-02-10 19:49:55	@Espyo	(crap in a whole different way)
2016-02-10 19:50:00	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-10 19:50:01	Yoshi2	C# is similar to Java in some ways
2016-02-10 19:50:10	@Espyo	(but since Unity isn't meant for hardcore programming, JavaScript probably works MILES better)
2016-02-10 19:50:23	@Espyo	yeah, C# is Java with a C skin
2016-02-10 19:50:32	Yoshi2	I actually heard good things about C#
2016-02-10 19:50:41	Yoshi2	I know a guy who hates Java and loves C#
2016-02-10 19:50:45	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-10 19:50:50	Yoshi2	well, several people who dislike Java and like C#
2016-02-10 19:51:20	Yoshi2	Java is Java with a C skin
2016-02-10 19:51:26	@Espyo	C and C++ is like telling somebody to go fetch a glass of water, but having to explain what water is, what walking is, what a glass is, what grabbing means, etc.
2016-02-10 19:51:44	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-10 19:51:51	Yoshi2	in C++ at least you have something that can be called a standard lib
2016-02-10 19:51:55	Scruffy	At least you don't have to tell it the point of doing that
2016-02-10 19:52:09	@Espyo	C# and Java is like telling somebody to go fetch a glass of water, but having to create the universe with a few instructions, specify a country with also a few instructions, specify what a glass is with a few instructions, specify what molecules make up glass with a few instructions, ...
2016-02-10 19:52:30	Yoshi2	(as far as I can tell, C++ has a much bigger stdlib than C)
2016-02-10 19:52:39	@Espyo	(C has one?)
2016-02-10 19:52:55	@Espyo	it's like, if you want to create a new "Person", "Person" being an arbitrary type that stores age and gender...
2016-02-10 19:53:04	@Espyo	in C and C++, the ideal way is Person p = Person()
2016-02-10 19:53:30	@Espyo	in Java and C#, the ideal way is Person p = PersonFactory.GetInstance().GenerateNewPerson()
2016-02-10 19:53:41	@Espyo	C# and Java like having everything all bundled nicely into their own classes
2016-02-10 19:53:44	@Espyo	but it ends up being INSANE
2016-02-10 19:54:01	Yoshi2	factories are bullcrap
2016-02-10 19:54:03	@Espyo	C and C++ code mostly has everything disorganized, but right there
2016-02-10 19:54:05	@Espyo	they really are
2016-02-10 19:54:08	Yoshi2	I saw factories in python
2016-02-10 19:54:11	Yoshi2	what the hell even
2016-02-10 19:55:51	@Espyo	no!
2016-02-10 19:56:00	@Espyo	don't contaminate something as innocent as Python with factories
2016-02-10 19:56:08	@Espyo	please, you'll drive me away from Python before I even get the chance to go inside ;_;
2016-02-10 20:00:45	Scruffy	Well, I'm grateful you guys will be able to help me
2016-02-10 20:00:58	Scruffy	I'm a greenhorn at the technical side of game design
2016-02-10 20:03:24	Yoshi2	game programming is a different beast tha regular programming, but it should be manageable
2016-02-10 20:04:11	Scruffy	I can imagine
2016-02-10 20:04:38	Scruffy	The sort of programming you guys pull off blows my mind
2016-02-10 20:05:43	Yoshi2	I tried unity a while ago, it was definitely interesting
2016-02-10 20:17:11	Yoshi2	after I'm done with this project, I will take a week vacation and do whatever, I guess
2016-02-10 20:17:33	Yoshi2	and then it's time to learn for exams .-.
2016-02-10 20:17:40	@Espyo	darn...

2016-02-10 20:34:16	Neocraftz1553	I was going to greet scruffy, but he left :b
2016-02-10 20:34:51	Neocraftz1553	did you see my latest render?
2016-02-10 20:36:07	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-10 20:36:11	@Espyo	I didn't catch it, no
2016-02-10 20:36:27	Neocraftz1553	wait, Testyo will blurt it out in a bit
2016-02-10 20:36:28	Testyo	one of revealing long-term projects is disturbing
2016-02-10 20:36:37	@Espyo	too late, saw it already
2016-02-10 20:36:38	Neocraftz1553	Would you like me to give you credit?
2016-02-10 20:36:40	@Espyo	looks pretty nice
2016-02-10 20:36:46	@Espyo	not necessarily
2016-02-10 20:36:49	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2016-02-10 20:36:57	@Espyo	otherwise my name would be on half of the recent images, since I keep providing models heh
2016-02-10 20:37:03	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-10 20:37:15	@Espyo	plus I'm only really giving the models, it's not really that big of a deal
2016-02-10 20:37:17	@Espyo	but thanks for asking
2016-02-10 20:37:18	Neocraftz1553	I'll give you credits to the Wall models, then
2016-02-10 20:37:25	@Espyo	if you want
2016-02-10 20:38:11	Neocraftz1553	So, have you been working on the Fan engine?

2016-02-10 20:39:08	Neocraftz1553	there you go
2016-02-10 20:41:10	Neocraftz1553	I'll ask you for some models in the future Espyo... maybe next week
2016-02-10 20:41:51	@Espyo	all righty
2016-02-10 20:42:21	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-10 20:42:31	Neocraftz1553	I don't want to bug you too much about the models
2016-02-10 20:44:04	@Espyo	it's not that much of a pain
2016-02-10 20:44:11	@Espyo	I mean, sure, it's not instantaneous
2016-02-10 20:44:14	@Espyo	but it's for a good cause
2016-02-10 20:44:17	@Espyo	good images come out of it
2016-02-10 20:44:19	@Espyo	so I don't mind
2016-02-10 20:44:39	@Espyo	although to be honest, it'd be a lot better if you could give a big list of models you need all in one go, instead of giving like one per day
2016-02-10 20:44:41	@Espyo	same for Scruffy
2016-02-10 20:44:49	@Espyo	not saying that that's how it is right now, but I'm just saying
2016-02-10 20:45:00	@Espyo	because loading 3DS Max really is the most boring part
2016-02-10 20:45:10	@Espyo	so if I can load it and convert several models in a single go, all the better
2016-02-10 20:45:32	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-02-10 20:46:05	Neocraftz1553	I think I'll list them in notepad
2016-02-10 20:46:16	Neocraftz1553	It'll take a few minutes
2016-02-10 20:46:18	Neocraftz1553	 20
2016-02-10 20:46:25	Neocraftz1553	I guess...
2016-02-10 20:46:39	Neocraftz1553	If there are any you can't get, thats ok
2016-02-10 20:48:31	@Espyo	okay
2016-02-10 20:53:48	Neocraftz1553	Do you have access to ripping tools for Pikmin 1?

2016-02-10 21:00:41	Neocraftz1553	ok there

2016-02-10 21:08:41	@Espyo	woah that's a lot
2016-02-10 21:08:55	@Espyo	starting to think if I should just dump all models on the model's resource
2016-02-10 21:19:39	@Espyo	doesn't look like anybody made any more progress with BFRES ripping
2016-02-10 21:19:52	@Espyo	there's a more up-to-date version of the 3DS Max script I use, which auto-textures, so that's neat
2016-02-10 21:20:00	@Espyo	but nothing that converts right away, without freaking Max

2016-02-10 22:06:30	@Espyo	also I'm not having a whole lot of luck with some models
2016-02-10 22:06:33	@Espyo	fire geyser won't load
2016-02-10 22:06:39	Neocraftz1553	oh

2016-02-10 22:07:25	Neocraftz1553	How about the Pyroclasmic Slooch

2016-02-10 22:08:06	@Espyo	hang on, gonna have to restart Max
2016-02-10 22:08:14	@Espyo	it trying to load the Armored Mawdad made it break completely

2016-02-10 22:27:04	Neocraftz1553	I might change the background to white later
2016-02-10 22:32:57	Neocraftz1553	So, Espyo, have you worked on the fangame engine?
2016-02-10 22:33:27	@Espyo	I haven't dropped it for the past month or so
2016-02-10 22:33:31	@Espyo	carrying's almost done
2016-02-10 22:33:33	@Espyo	it's so complex...
2016-02-10 22:33:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah...
2016-02-10 22:33:45	@Espyo	I'm still not quite sure what to do about carrying speeds
2016-02-10 22:33:50	@Espyo	it's a whole subject in and of itself
2016-02-10 22:33:54	@Espyo	they should teach it in schools
2016-02-10 22:34:08	Neocraftz1553	heh, yeah
2016-02-10 22:35:46	Neocraftz1553	"Pikmin carry objects relative to the objects walking speed, so now we just tweak so and so and now each Pikmin carries items at different speeds"
2016-02-10 22:35:57	@Espyo	yep
2016-02-10 22:36:54	Neocraftz1553	Is the Fangame engime Javascript?
2016-02-10 22:37:01	Neocraftz1553	or C++
2016-02-10 22:37:11	@Espyo	C++
2016-02-10 22:37:27	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-02-10 22:37:48	Neocraftz1553	I think they should add programming classes and such to schools
2016-02-10 22:37:57	@Espyo	don't they?
2016-02-10 22:38:07	@Espyo	I started in school
2016-02-10 22:38:26	@Espyo	well, school here, you need to choose a subject to specialize in for your 10th to 12th grades
2016-02-10 22:38:29	@Espyo	I chose computers
2016-02-10 22:38:33	@Espyo	boom, have some programming
2016-02-10 22:38:46	Neocraftz1553	not here
2016-02-10 22:39:04	@Espyo	but I hear they're trying to make a global effort to start teaching programming to all kids in school
2016-02-10 22:39:08	@Espyo	which they should
2016-02-10 22:39:10	Neocraftz1553	not until collage, I think
2016-02-10 22:39:15	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-10 22:39:16	@Espyo	it's just like playing with LEGO
2016-02-10 22:39:20	@Espyo	well, if you use the right programming language
2016-02-10 22:39:25	Neocraftz1553	It would hel the world alot
2016-02-10 22:39:26	@Espyo	otherwise it's like playing with a real bridge
2016-02-10 22:39:29	@Espyo	with real deaths :|
2016-02-10 22:39:36	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-10 22:39:58	@Espyo	honestly, if I'm not careful, the engine could accidentally eat up your whole memory
2016-02-10 22:40:04	@Espyo	(which windows will GLADLY let happen)
2016-02-10 22:40:10	@Espyo	almost mandatorily forcing a reboot
2016-02-10 22:40:22	@Espyo	luckily that doesn't really happen <_< >_>
2016-02-10 22:40:32	@Espyo	on one of my projects, I let it happen >_>
2016-02-10 22:40:44	@Espyo	shouldn't happen again any time soon, don't worry <_<
2016-02-10 22:40:52	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-10 22:41:03	Neocraftz1553	good to know
2016-02-10 22:47:22	Neocraftz1553	I only know JavaScript for now...
2016-02-10 22:47:55	@Espyo	it's similar
2016-02-10 22:47:57	@Espyo	but more complex
2016-02-10 22:48:33	Neocraftz1553	to C++?
2016-02-10 22:50:09	Neocraftz1553	I only know how to make shapes with JavaScript x.x
2016-02-10 22:51:17	En_Passant	They teach programming in my high school
2016-02-10 22:51:25	Neocraftz1553	lucky
2016-02-10 22:51:36	Yoshi2	I had programming as an additional course at my school
2016-02-10 22:51:42	Neocraftz1553	I teach myself
2016-02-10 22:51:43	En_Passant	There's only one teacher with three courses (one of which is AP), and he's not especially experienced
2016-02-10 22:52:21	Neocraftz1553	Hello Yoshi2
2016-02-10 22:53:35	Yoshi2	hi
2016-02-10 22:54:26	Yoshi2	2 hours per week is not enough to teach programming though
2016-02-10 22:54:49	Yoshi2	so if you really wanted to become good at it, you'd want to do much more of it at home
2016-02-10 22:55:11	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-10 22:55:58	Neocraftz1553	I usually teach myself for a day or two

2016-02-10 22:59:04	Scruffy	Cool, it's really smooth
2016-02-10 22:59:19	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it surprised me
2016-02-10 22:59:35	Neocraftz1553	It looked kinda like your renders
2016-02-10 22:59:44	Neocraftz1553	So, I am pretty proud of it
2016-02-10 23:00:13	Scruffy	Yeah, it looks great

2016-02-10 23:00:43	Neocraftz1553	I think I'll use textures more often now
2016-02-10 23:01:05	Scruffy	Cool
2016-02-10 23:01:30	Neocraftz1553	Before, I used pure materials

2016-02-10 23:02:08	Neocraftz1553	Oh, and I found Olimars Wife's texture in your Pikmin Forever Cycles
2016-02-10 23:02:16	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-10 23:03:34	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-10 23:05:12	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy, how did you make the Crystal Wall in your Garden of hope render?
2016-02-10 23:05:18	Neocraftz1553	The materials
2016-02-10 23:07:25	Neocraftz1553	oh, btw, the wooly bulborb is awsome
2016-02-10 23:10:37	Neocraftz1553	I need you guys to judge this new concept I've been working on for Pikmin: Return
2016-02-10 23:12:53	En_Passant	I'm listening
2016-02-10 23:13:00	Neocraftz1553	Many enemies will make an appearance as a mini boss; they will be huge, like the Skutterchuck, for example, and the Pyroplasmic Slooch
2016-02-10 23:13:40	Neocraftz1553	Should I explain the Skutterchucks battle?
2016-02-10 23:17:17	Scruffy	Okay, so I modelled it from scratch, and then first came the glass material
2016-02-10 23:17:33	Neocraftz1553	The Skutterchuck will walk around the arena, similer to the Armored Mawdad's arena, and can walk up walls
2016-02-10 23:18:00	En_Passant	Oh, so kind of like Robot Carnival/Storm from Sonic Heroes
2016-02-10 23:18:25	Scruffy	It's one material (70% white Glossy, 30% 50-strength Emission) mixed with a Glass shader, using a Fresnel input to decide between the two
2016-02-10 23:18:53	Scruffy	Which means it's glass-like when you look perpendicular to it, and glossy/emissive when you look parallel to it
2016-02-10 23:19:04	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-02-10 23:19:05	Scruffy	This way you could see through it but also see the cracks inside it
2016-02-10 23:19:18	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-02-10 23:19:25	Neocraftz1553	I'll have to try ir
2016-02-10 23:19:42	Neocraftz1553	@En_Passant Kinda
2016-02-10 23:20:00	Neocraftz1553	I havent played sonic heros in a while
2016-02-10 23:20:08	Neocraftz1553	*4 years
2016-02-10 23:20:22	Scruffy	And then the metal is just a metal texture on a Diffuse shader, nothing special but it looked just how I wanted it to
2016-02-10 23:21:07	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, there will be giant Crystal Nodules around the arena, and they take 55 direct hits with rock pikmin to destroy, and 45 to become unusable to the skutterchuck
2016-02-10 23:22:08	Neocraftz1553	If all three of them are destroyed, the Skutterchuck will walk up into the ceiling and drop down 3 more
2016-02-10 23:22:12	Neocraftz1553	and so on
2016-02-10 23:23:04	Neocraftz1553	The giant crystal Nodules will trap rock Pikmin beneath them, making them unusable unless the ball is removed

2016-02-10 23:23:32	Neocraftz1553	*to
2016-02-10 23:23:44	En_Passant	Any particular reason why it has to be a giant version of an existing enemy?
2016-02-10 23:23:47	Neocraftz1553	Its better off made into an article...
2016-02-10 23:24:24	Neocraftz1553	Its a side-mini boss, you could go through part of the game without encountering them
2016-02-10 23:25:14	Neocraftz1553	But there will be Areas with the small varients, and if they are left alone for 10 or more days, the giant one will appear
2016-02-10 23:25:20	Neocraftz1553	sorry, gtg
2016-02-10 23:28:05	Scruffy	Ok, see ya later
2016-02-10 23:29:15	Neocraftz1553	What are your thoughts about it, hate or like
2016-02-10 23:29:42	Neocraftz1553	oh and for the reason why it has to be a larger variant, think of it like the enemy getting overgrown
2016-02-10 23:30:40	Neocraftz1553	heh, I am going to be here for a few more minutes
2016-02-10 23:30:58	Neocraftz1553	but before I go, any thoughts about it?
2016-02-10 23:31:50	Scruffy	Do you just bombard the big Skutterchuck with Rock Pikmi?
2016-02-10 23:31:54	Scruffy	Pikmin*
2016-02-10 23:32:15	Neocraftz1553	not exactly
2016-02-10 23:33:13	En_Passant	That's... not how biology works
2016-02-10 23:33:27	Neocraftz1553	It is about the size of the bosses in Pikmin 3
2016-02-10 23:33:38	Scruffy	They vary greatly in size
2016-02-10 23:33:45	Neocraftz1553	@En_Passant I know :b
2016-02-10 23:33:51	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-02-10 23:33:55	Scruffy	Like Scornet Maestro size? Or Armored Mawdad? Or..
2016-02-10 23:33:56	Neocraftz1553	think...uhh
2016-02-10 23:34:24	Neocraftz1553	About Between Vehemoth Phosbat and Quaggled Mireclops
2016-02-10 23:35:12	Neocraftz1553	Red pikmin can latch onto any part of its body, including legs
2016-02-10 23:35:22	@Espyo	I'll do the rest of the requests tomorrow, Neo
2016-02-10 23:35:31	Neocraftz1553	yeah, ok
2016-02-10 23:35:31	@Espyo	Max is NOT cooperating in the slightest
2016-02-10 23:35:37	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-10 23:35:43	Scruffy	Oooh, what did you request?
2016-02-10 23:35:54	Neocraftz1553	A list...
2016-02-10 23:35:57	Scruffy	Oh
2016-02-10 23:36:02	Neocraftz1553	Of P3 enemies
2016-02-10 23:36:46	Scruffy	Oh, I need to ask before I go crazy for uncertainty
2016-02-10 23:37:00	Scruffy	En_Passant, is it currently 4:36 for you?
2016-02-10 23:37:01	Neocraftz1553	If the Skutterchuck is hit in the eyes, it will recoil, kinda like a red Bulborb
2016-02-10 23:37:20	En_Passant	yes
2016-02-10 23:37:24	Scruffy	Ok good
2016-02-10 23:37:46	Neocraftz1553	It can knock down and deflower Pikmin with its feet when it stomps, though
2016-02-10 23:37:55	Scruffy	I had been under the delusion that your email stating 1:00 tomorrow was /my/ 1:00; I have a recital at that time
2016-02-10 23:38:41	Neocraftz1553	Theres more to it, though
2016-02-10 23:38:44	En_Passant	no, it's 3 your time
2016-02-10 23:38:56	Scruffy	Right right, I've got it
2016-02-10 23:39:14	Scruffy	I'm going to need your Skype address somehow
2016-02-10 23:40:13	Scruffy	Neo: it can knock down Pikmin with its feet? Even though it has the little spindly feet? Does it perhaps stomp the ground or something?
2016-02-10 23:40:14	En_Passant	Oh, yeah
2016-02-10 23:40:18	En_Passant	I'll e-mail you guys
2016-02-10 23:40:21	Scruffy	Thanks
2016-02-10 23:40:54	Scruffy	I'll pay my sacrifices in prayer to the deities of Wi-fi
2016-02-10 23:40:58	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy: yes
2016-02-10 23:41:34	Neocraftz1553	hey scruffy, did you use bump maps for the Woolly bulborb
2016-02-10 23:41:59	Scruffy	Not a bump map, just a normal map
2016-02-10 23:42:17	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-02-10 23:42:54	Neocraftz1553	oh that
2016-02-10 23:42:55	Scruffy	I used a normal map, you know, the weird looking purple maps? Their color conveys 3D directions
2016-02-10 23:43:06	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-10 23:43:13	Scruffy	I finally learned the difference actually
2016-02-10 23:43:53	Scruffy	Bump maps can only use a simple lighting trick; 50% grey represents 0 elevation, and darker colors dip while lighter colors bump
2016-02-10 23:44:15	Scruffy	It works but most textures aren't really designed for bump mapping
2016-02-10 23:44:36	Neocraftz1553	so normal maps are better?
2016-02-10 23:45:09	Scruffy	Yes, their multiple colors can tell a texture to stick out in multiple directions, producing more realistic looking bumps
2016-02-10 23:45:37	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-02-10 23:45:39	Scruffy	Now, it's still fake; the bumps aren't actually part of the geometry (that's displacement textures)
2016-02-10 23:45:49	Scruffy	But it is more accurate and reacts with light better
2016-02-10 23:45:53	Neocraftz1553	I used Bump maps in the Dirt wall
2016-02-10 23:46:12	Scruffy	And that's fine with a grainy texture like the dirt; it works really wall
2016-02-10 23:46:18	Scruffy	well* but pun intended
2016-02-10 23:47:13	Scruffy	But with a smoother texture, for example a Red Bulborb's spots, 1-dimension bumps aren't enough to convey depth
2016-02-10 23:47:45	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-02-11 01:10:51	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy
2016-02-11 01:11:30	Scruffy	Hi
2016-02-11 01:12:35	Neocraftz1553	HDRI maps...
2016-02-11 01:13:03	Neocraftz1553	aren't those "natural lighting" backgrounds?
2016-02-11 01:13:14	Scruffy	YE
2016-02-11 01:13:16	Scruffy	Yes*
2016-02-11 01:13:24	Neocraftz1553	thought so
2016-02-11 01:13:39	Neocraftz1553	They are pretty hard to use, in my opinion
2016-02-11 01:13:47	Scruffy	There's a very specific way to implement them
2016-02-11 01:13:54	Scruffy	where did you get yours?
2016-02-11 01:14:06	Neocraftz1553	Images :b
2016-02-11 01:14:08	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-02-11 01:14:39	Neocraftz1553	I got it from this one place that has a collection of HDRI maps and stuff
2016-02-11 01:14:47	Scruffy	What's it called/
2016-02-11 01:15:11	Neocraftz1553	I would put the name, but I dunno
2016-02-11 01:15:18	Scruffy	Just want to make sure it's a legitimate HDRI
2016-02-11 01:15:24	Scruffy	It should be called .hdr
2016-02-11 01:15:33	Scruffy	And it should be a really big file
2016-02-11 01:16:05	Neocraftz1553	yeah, thats why I erased it
2016-02-11 01:16:09	Scruffy	Ah okay
2016-02-11 01:16:41	Neocraftz1553	I did not use it for much things
2016-02-11 01:18:08	Scruffy	I see
2016-02-11 01:18:45	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin 1 Bulborbs sound very high pitched
2016-02-11 01:18:46	Scruffy	Well, there's a special technique for getting it to work correctly
2016-02-11 01:19:00	Scruffy	The only problem is the big file size
2016-02-11 01:19:06	Neocraftz1553	heh, I am random sometimes
2016-02-11 01:19:31	Scruffy	Wait, do you have the Gamecube version or the new play control?
2016-02-11 01:19:40	Neocraftz1553	GC
2016-02-11 01:19:52	Scruffy	Ah
2016-02-11 01:19:56	Scruffy	Yeah, that's true
2016-02-11 01:20:14	Scruffy	In the New play control version though, they're extremely high pitched; very squeaky
2016-02-11 01:20:14	Neocraftz1553	they squeal when attacking
2016-02-11 01:20:17	Neocraftz1553	and stuff
2016-02-11 01:20:27	Scruffy	I have no idea why they made the change
2016-02-11 01:20:34	Neocraftz1553	me niether
2016-02-11 01:21:05	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy, how did you make the bomb rocks material?
2016-02-11 01:21:19	Neocraftz1553	oh, no
2016-02-11 01:21:26	Neocraftz1553	I might disconnect
2016-02-11 01:21:28	Scruffy	There was a material that came with the bomb rock (I got it on the Models resource)
2016-02-11 01:21:49	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-11 01:21:54	Neocraftz1553	and the Onion?
2016-02-11 01:22:02	Neocraftz1553	The green blotches
2016-02-11 01:24:49	Scruffy	But, in addition to that texture, I created my own displacement texture
2016-02-11 01:24:51	Scruffy	Oh for the Onion
2016-02-11 01:25:50	Scruffy	I used a Cycles noise texture to choose between yellow-green diffuse and golden glossy

2016-02-11 02:12:54	Scruffy	I've just started learning game development so that I might be able to help you on the technical front if you need it
2016-02-11 02:13:06	Scruffy	And also I've been yearning to create my own game from scratch
2016-02-11 02:14:32	En_Passant	What sort of game development?
2016-02-11 02:16:57	Scruffy	Basic programming, learning about colliders, and how to create basal game elements like floors, players, and collectibles
2016-02-11 02:17:08	Scruffy	Nothing fancy yet, but I'm getting there in case you need backup
2016-02-11 02:20:45	En_Passant	You're probably going to know more than I do before long

2016-02-11 21:07:23	Testyo	try that one was easy for me, just because it got stuck in the ground every time it came out
2016-02-11 21:08:30	Neocraftz1553	Espyo, any luck with the models?
2016-02-11 21:09:26	@Espyo	more or less

2016-02-11 21:37:20	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm
2016-02-11 21:37:20	Testyo	I said okay, so in Portuguese, we don't have to seriously consider using multiple plates at meal times because Neocraftz1553 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages okay, I'm going to have to seriously consider using multiple plates at meal times and okay, so in Portuguese, we don't have a word for lampshade.

2016-02-11 21:59:02	@Espyo	yeah, me, Scruffy and En_Passant had a meeting to discuss the progress on En_Passant's project
2016-02-11 21:59:11	Scruffy	It went quite well
2016-02-11 21:59:18	@Espyo	it really did
2016-02-11 21:59:47	@Espyo	I did feel a bit of lag, unfortunately
2016-02-11 21:59:49	@Espyo	but what can you do
2016-02-11 21:59:54	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-11 22:00:01	Scruffy	Sorry you missed the Blender tutorial
2016-02-11 22:00:07	@Espyo	heh, it's fine
2016-02-11 22:00:17	@Espyo	I tried following Blender tutorials a few times in the past
2016-02-11 22:00:26	@Espyo	but I never really paid attention
2016-02-11 22:01:08	Scruffy	Those tutorials aren't really that easy to pay attention to
2016-02-11 22:01:15	Scruffy	One-on-one is better
2016-02-11 22:01:20	@Espyo	it really is
2016-02-11 22:01:26	@Espyo	like, I was hearing from the moment I joined
2016-02-11 22:01:29	@Espyo	and although I couldn't see
2016-02-11 22:01:32	@Espyo	I was imagining it pretty clearly
2016-02-11 22:01:50	@Espyo	(wow, zipping the recording did nothing)
2016-02-11 22:02:00	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-11 22:02:12	@Espyo	it sucks that I didn't record the whole thing, it makes it sound suspicious
2016-02-11 22:02:24	@Espyo	like, conveniently there's no recording of the meeting itself, only after
2016-02-11 22:02:28	@Espyo	sounds fishy
2016-02-11 22:02:41	Scruffy	Yeah...
2016-02-11 22:02:45	Scruffy	I think it will be all right though
2016-02-11 22:02:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-11 22:02:57	@Espyo	I doubt most people even have as much proof as we do
2016-02-11 22:03:02	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-11 22:03:27	Scruffy	And we're probably going to have more meetings anywar
2016-02-11 22:03:30	Scruffy	anyway*
2016-02-11 22:03:39	@Espyo	I mean, I'm assuming only half of the people have their advisors show up in person
2016-02-11 22:03:46	@Espyo	the other half probably uses skype, with no recording
2016-02-11 22:03:49	@Espyo	...it didn't mute my mic
2016-02-11 22:04:00	@Espyo	oh, well, I guess it's because the program is kinda independent
2016-02-11 22:04:10	Scruffy	There was no obstructive noise anyhow
2016-02-11 22:04:19	@Espyo	not for you, but there was a bit for the call recorder
2016-02-11 22:04:25	Scruffy	Oh I see
2016-02-11 22:04:25	@Espyo	you can hear me and my family dining in the distance
2016-02-11 22:04:35	@Espyo	...I COULD edit it out
2016-02-11 22:04:38	@Espyo	but it'll just make it sound MORE fishy
2016-02-11 22:04:41	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-11 22:05:11	@Espyo	eh, whatever
2016-02-11 22:05:15	@Espyo	yeah, that's my personal life
2016-02-11 22:05:16	@Espyo	I have one
2016-02-11 22:05:23	@Espyo	I didn't do anything fishy on it, so I might as well keep it
2016-02-11 22:05:25	@Espyo	you can BARELY hear it anyway
2016-02-11 22:05:30	Scruffy	No worries
2016-02-11 22:08:06	@Espyo	man, you have an awesome voice, Scruffy, gotta say
2016-02-11 22:08:17	@Espyo	it looks like people who are good with music just have good voices
2016-02-11 22:08:20	@Espyo	it's like this weird coincidence in life
2016-02-11 22:08:23	@Espyo	or maybe there's more to it
2016-02-11 22:08:46	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-11 22:08:56	Scruffy	People have told me that before
2016-02-11 22:09:03	@Espyo	then you know it's true
2016-02-11 22:09:10	Scruffy	Suggestions have come for voice acting, or audiobook reading
2016-02-11 22:09:11	@Espyo	combine that with a nice tutorial
2016-02-11 22:09:17	@Espyo	and you've got the recipe for a good way of explaining stuff to people
2016-02-11 22:09:35	Scruffy	Personally I find it pretty hilarious, I think my voice is pretty run-of-the-mill
2016-02-11 22:09:47	Scruffy	But voice acting is fun, nonetheless
2016-02-11 22:09:48	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-02-11 22:09:53	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-02-11 22:10:58	@Espyo	En_Passant: e-mail sent, with the recording
2016-02-11 22:12:13	@Espyo	the meeting came at a good time; I actually WANTED a bit of a rest from the engine
2016-02-11 22:12:22	@Espyo	got some complicated parts coming up for carrying, so it's good to let loose a bit
2016-02-11 22:12:41	Scruffy	I can imagine
2016-02-11 22:13:11	@Espyo	also, when you shared your webcam, you first striked me as being similar to James from Extra Credits https://vfs.edu/sites/vfs.edu/files/news/uploads/2012/02/03/James-Portnow-1.gif
2016-02-11 22:13:19	@Espyo	which is funny, since he's a pretty good game developer
2016-02-11 22:13:42	Scruffy	Now you see why someone looked at me and referred to me as "Scruffy"
2016-02-11 22:13:48	@Espyo	haha
2016-02-11 22:13:52	@Espyo	it looks fine, don't worry

2016-02-11 22:14:04	@Espyo	En_Passant: don't you have to write down a summary of the meeting?
2016-02-11 22:15:46	@Espyo	...oh, the Toady Bloyster only has 6 proboscis in P3
2016-02-11 22:16:03	@Espyo	oh, that's already written on the article
2016-02-11 22:23:25	Scruffy	I've gotta go for now
2016-02-11 22:23:31	@Espyo	all right
2016-02-11 22:23:32	Scruffy	I will probably be on later
2016-02-11 22:23:33	@Espyo	see you later

2016-02-11 22:26:43	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-11 22:26:48	@Espyo	well, okay, maybe not half
2016-02-11 22:27:00	En_Passant	I think I'm the only person to have an advisor that lives outside of the state
2016-02-11 22:27:02	@Espyo	but I'm sure some must've had people that couldn't be there in person
2016-02-11 22:27:11	@Espyo	that better give bonus points
2016-02-11 22:27:19	En_Passant	I'm definitely the only one to have one from outside the country ;P
2016-02-11 22:27:38	@Espyo	hehe
2016-02-11 22:27:39	En_Passant	That seems like it would be fishier, actually
2016-02-11 22:27:52	@Espyo	...yeah
2016-02-11 22:28:07	@Espyo	well, I don't think they'll make a big deal of it
2016-02-11 22:28:20	@Espyo	if they really want to prove my authenticity, they can phone my company
2016-02-11 22:28:30	En_Passant	lol
2016-02-11 22:29:07	En_Passant	nothing says dedication like paying long distance fees

2016-02-12 19:15:44	Yoshi2	I made a graph of the battalion wars xml file, and I've gotta say, it looks pretty interesting
2016-02-12 19:15:48	Yoshi2	but it is a huge mess
2016-02-12 19:16:41	@Espyo	hehe, I bet
2016-02-12 19:16:50	@Espyo	what with? a custom tool?
2016-02-12 19:17:43	Yoshi2	I used python and networkx to create the graph structure, and another program to render the graph
2016-02-12 19:20:55	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-12 19:21:32	Yoshi2	currently testing cytoscape, but I don't like the performance of it
2016-02-12 19:25:12	Yoshi2	I know this graph has like a million nodes, but zooming in takes forever

2016-02-12 19:28:45	Yoshi2	hey Scruffy 
2016-02-12 19:30:36	Scruffy	Hello!
2016-02-12 19:34:32	Yoshi2	hm, this graphing program does support various layout algorithms, so that's pretty cool
2016-02-12 19:35:31	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-02-12 20:03:42	Yoshi2	mother of god
2016-02-12 20:03:48	Yoshi2	it is using up 1.6 gb of my ram
2016-02-12 20:03:55	@Espyo	whaa?!
2016-02-12 20:04:08	@Espyo	are you sure you didn't load the full game into an XML and then parsed it?
2016-02-12 20:05:20	Yoshi2	there is actually a button to free memory in the programm
2016-02-12 20:05:26	Yoshi2	I'll press it
2016-02-12 20:06:03	@J	you didn't need those rams anyway
2016-02-12 20:06:22	Yoshi2	didn't do anything
2016-02-12 20:06:27	Yoshi2	I'll restart it
2016-02-12 20:07:04	@Espyo	is that button the white X on the red background?
2016-02-12 20:07:23	@Espyo	(yeah, the classic X on the button was never really red, it was always wite)
2016-02-12 20:07:25	@Espyo	*h
2016-02-12 20:08:37	Yoshi2	of course, kill() is the best way of managing memory
2016-02-12 20:08:45	Yoshi2	what the hell, this program is a memory hog
2016-02-12 20:08:51	@Espyo	sudo reboot
2016-02-12 20:09:00	Yoshi2	900 MB without any graphs loaded
2016-02-12 20:09:06	@Espyo	...what
2016-02-12 20:09:15	Yoshi2	that's java for you, I guess
2016-02-12 20:09:25	Yoshi2	(the program is in java)
2016-02-12 20:09:26	@Espyo	oh, that explains it
2016-02-12 20:22:59	Yoshi2	one thing I find odd is how one of the object types in this file is TequillaEffect
2016-02-12 20:24:14	Yoshi2	well, TequillaEffectResource but the exact term is less important
2016-02-12 20:24:20	@Espyo	|:
2016-02-12 20:25:03	Yoshi2	-l in Tequila
2016-02-12 20:27:06	Yoshi2	I think that object type is for SFX effects, but I am not sure what tequila has to do with anything
2016-02-12 20:30:53	@Espyo	does it create bubbles?
2016-02-12 20:30:58	@Espyo	or make the screen go wobbly?
2016-02-12 20:31:07	@Espyo	wait
2016-02-12 20:31:12	@Espyo	your "SFX effects" is confusing me
2016-02-12 20:31:22	@Espyo	not only did you say "S effects effects"
2016-02-12 20:31:24	@J	very sad
2016-02-12 20:31:27	@Espyo	but I'm not sure if the S is for special or sound
2016-02-12 20:32:38	Yoshi2	yes
2016-02-12 20:32:48	Yoshi2	ATM machine
2016-02-12 20:32:51	Yoshi2	pin number
2016-02-12 20:33:47	@Espyo	yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
2016-02-12 20:34:03	@J	what?
2016-02-12 20:34:15	@J	oh
2016-02-12 20:34:17	Yoshi2	might be either of those, I have no idea
2016-02-12 20:36:28	Yoshi2	some of the layout algorithms create work of art
2016-02-12 20:36:29	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/B5E7K7B.png
2016-02-12 20:37:16	@Espyo	it's like it has horizontal motion blur
2016-02-12 20:37:37	@Espyo	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5z619uid9ayzldx/AABaeQ7yqUqizWkKIdBCwntPa?dl=0 can you lot access the files here?
2016-02-12 20:37:53	Yoshi2	yFiles organic
2016-02-12 20:38:05	Yoshi2	Espyo: the "horizontal motion blur" comes from the node names
2016-02-12 20:38:09	@Espyo	I figured
2016-02-12 20:38:15	Yoshi2	which are too long for the boxes
2016-02-12 20:38:25	@Espyo	could've maybe used a different color between the nodes and the names, but *shrug*
2016-02-12 20:40:02	@Espyo	I'm not sure if that "yFiles organic" was a response to my Dropbox question
2016-02-12 20:40:05	Yoshi2	probably, but the picture is useless anyway because you can't read anything
2016-02-12 20:40:15	Yoshi2	Espyo: it was the layout algorithm I used
2016-02-12 20:40:18	@Espyo	it's... honestly just a simple yes or no question, it's weird how 5+ people can't answer
2016-02-12 20:40:42	@Espyo	oh
2016-02-12 20:40:52	Yoshi2	Espyo: I can access the files
2016-02-12 20:40:56	@Espyo	oh, okay
2016-02-12 20:40:57	@Espyo	thanks
2016-02-12 20:41:05	Yoshi2	(I can download at least one of them, not going to try them all)
2016-02-12 20:41:12	@Espyo	right, Neo asked me to convert all of those models
2016-02-12 20:41:21	@Espyo	since there's so many, I figured I might as well start a folder and put them there
2016-02-12 20:41:29	@Espyo	I still have space on my Dropbox, so...
2016-02-12 20:41:37	@Espyo	feel free to download stuff from there, Scruffy
2016-02-12 20:41:38	Yoshi2	heh
2016-02-12 20:41:47	@Espyo	can't promise I'll keep that folder forever, though
2016-02-12 20:43:52	@J	not putting them all in one archive is just asking to make someone angry
2016-02-12 20:44:56	@Espyo	but on the other hand
2016-02-12 20:45:20	@Espyo	putting them all in one archive means that "hey, I need a model for a Glowcap. Time to download a 100MB file to get just the one 100KB thing in it"
2016-02-12 20:50:32	Scruffy	Got it
2016-02-12 20:50:58	Scruffy	Thanks Espyo!
2016-02-12 20:51:37	@J	so lazy, you should put in the effort and do both
2016-02-12 20:54:00	Scruffy	I'll let you guys know if I find any interesting details to these models
2016-02-12 21:18:03	@Espyo	but then I wouldn't have Dropbox space left
2016-02-12 21:18:04	@Espyo	or at least less
2016-02-12 21:18:18	@Espyo	as you can see, if you're dedicated enough, you can be lazy, but pass it off as having tied hands
2016-02-12 21:18:23	@Espyo	all right
2016-02-12 21:18:30	@Espyo	I just converted the textures and dumped them without looking
2016-02-12 21:18:36	@Espyo	so they could have something worthy
2016-02-12 21:20:25	@Espyo	guys
2016-02-12 21:20:28	@Espyo	oops, wrong chat
2016-02-12 21:36:24	Scruffy	The P3 Candypop Bud has a stem
2016-02-12 21:37:17	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-12 21:37:23	@Espyo	same as P1 and P2 then
2016-02-12 21:37:24	@Espyo	neat
2016-02-12 21:37:30	@Espyo	and mysterious all the same
2016-02-12 21:37:36	Scruffy	That accounts for about a third of its height

2016-02-12 22:29:19	Scruffy	So that its specular highlights can be so olorful in the game
2016-02-12 22:29:32	@Espyo	I honestly don't remember this

2016-02-13 17:11:15	@Espyo	I've converted the models you asked
2016-02-13 17:11:19	@Espyo	or, well, the ones I could
2016-02-13 17:11:25	Neocraftz1553	really?
2016-02-13 17:11:29	Neocraftz1553	 thanks!
2016-02-13 17:11:34	@Espyo	I put them all on my Dropbox folder
2016-02-13 17:11:45	@Espyo	I'll give you the download link in a bit, but I forgot to add a few ones I already did before

2016-02-13 18:19:24	@Espyo	did you get the memo?

2016-02-13 18:33:34	Testyo	I said which is how I can got a run because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages which is how I can see if something goes horribly wrong and okay, I finally got a run.

2016-02-13 19:38:59	@Espyo	SO
2016-02-13 19:39:02	@Espyo	painful to science sometimes
2016-02-13 19:39:12	@Espyo	to get 20 Purple Pikmin to carry a 10-pellet all at the same time
2016-02-13 19:39:18	@Espyo	you need to toss 9 or 10 to the opposite side of where you are
2016-02-13 19:39:23	@Espyo	and then C-stick the others onto the pellet
2016-02-13 19:39:28	@Espyo	only then will they all start carrying at once
2016-02-13 19:39:38	@Espyo	but it's incredibly precise
2016-02-13 19:39:59	@Espyo	if you do it wrong, a few Pikmin might want to go to a spot on the opposite side of the pellet, and not make it there in time and the pellet begins moving before them
2016-02-13 19:40:13	@Espyo	worst part is I want them to deliver to the blue Onion specifically
2016-02-13 19:40:26	@Espyo	so on top of that, the chances of getting the destination I want are 1 in 3
2016-02-13 19:40:36	@Espyo	THEY FEEL MORE LIKE THEY'RE ONE IN TEN
2016-02-13 19:40:37	@Espyo	BUT IT'S OKAY

2016-02-13 19:41:56	@Espyo	ALL I HAD TO DO WAS COMPLAIN
2016-02-13 19:41:59	@Espyo	and I was able to get it first try
2016-02-13 19:42:00	@Espyo	ugh
2016-02-13 19:42:03	@Espyo	no more of that test, please
2016-02-13 19:42:18	@Espyo	...
2016-02-13 19:42:18	@Espyo	...
2016-02-13 19:42:19	@Espyo	...
2016-02-13 19:42:23	@Espyo	I already made this specific test before
2016-02-13 19:43:12	En_Passant	What's the purpose of this test?
2016-02-13 19:44:25	@Espyo	figuring out carrying speeds
2016-02-13 19:44:34	@Espyo	it's looking to be pretty complicated...
2016-02-13 19:44:54	@Espyo	but, I already concluded that ultra-spicy spray makes the Pikmin act as flowers, as far as the game cares
2016-02-13 19:45:07	@Espyo	so apparently, spraying a group of flower Pikmin to get them to carry something faster is COMPLETELY POINTLESS
2016-02-13 20:05:45	@Espyo	boy, it's tricky to come to a solid conclusion
2016-02-13 20:06:13	@Espyo	flowers are NOT twice as fast as leaves, and twice the number of Pikmin does NOT mean a twofold increase in speed
2016-02-13 20:06:31	@Espyo	for Reds, having leaves instead of flowers OR having twice the number of carriers means a 1.4x increase
2016-02-13 20:06:36	@Espyo	for Purples, 1.1x increase
2016-02-13 20:06:54	@Espyo	Whites are a bit different, in that flowers instead of leaves provide a 1.2x speed increase
2016-02-13 20:07:03	@Espyo	but twice the number of Whites means a 1.6x speed increase

2016-02-13 20:29:13	Yoshi2	I should finish my archive parser for BW, then I can write something that modifies them
2016-02-13 20:32:02	@Espyo	I'm not sure
2016-02-13 20:32:08	@Espyo	wait
2016-02-13 20:32:10	@Espyo	I can check
2016-02-13 20:32:15	@Espyo	but with Purples only
2016-02-13 20:32:32	@Espyo	since for the most part, you can only really have between the minimum required amount and twice that
2016-02-13 20:32:39	@Espyo	since most things have like 10 weight, 20 slots
2016-02-13 20:32:41	@Espyo	 5 weight, 10 slots
2016-02-13 20:32:43	@Espyo	etc.
2016-02-13 20:33:20	@Espyo	 10 Purples are 1.81591x faster than 1 Purple
2016-02-13 20:33:32	@Espyo	 20 Purples are 2.73239x faster than 1 Purple

2016-02-13 20:40:32	@Espyo	okay, I tried changing some unknown parameters related to carrying
2016-02-13 20:40:37	@Espyo	the game REALLY loves making objects lift off
2016-02-13 20:40:50	@Espyo	when I increased the speed of the Iridescent Glint Beetle in my video, it flew off effortlessly
2016-02-13 20:41:01	@Espyo	I increased the speed of a Purple, it almost took off with its speed
2016-02-13 20:41:32	@Espyo	THIS IS HILARIOUS

2016-02-13 21:00:51	@Espyo	you're welcome
2016-02-13 21:00:54	@Espyo	that was actually pretty tough
2016-02-13 21:01:01	@Espyo	didn't expect the list to be so big...
2016-02-13 21:01:19	@Espyo	didn't expect the process to be so overly taxing either
2016-02-13 21:01:21	@Espyo	but it's all done now
2016-02-13 21:01:31	@Espyo	and that folder will be useful to place more models in the future as they're requested
2016-02-13 21:03:45	Yoshi2	can i request bw models (that also requires figuring out the bw format but i am sure you can do that) 
2016-02-13 21:04:32	Yoshi2	kthx
2016-02-13 21:05:56	@Espyo	sure
2016-02-13 21:06:03	@Espyo	it'll just probably take N/A time
2016-02-13 21:06:24	Yoshi2	awesome
2016-02-13 21:06:26	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-13 21:06:26	Neocraftz1553	sorry for the trouble
2016-02-13 21:06:27	Neocraftz1553	are the models the size they were in P3 :b
2016-02-13 21:06:27	Neocraftz1553	Cause they are small
2016-02-13 21:07:33	@Espyo	well, whatever units your modelling program uses probably don't match up the Pikmin 3 units
2016-02-13 21:07:43	@Espyo	but if didn't tamper with the size of any model
2016-02-13 21:07:50	@Espyo	so they should all be the right size compared to one another
2016-02-13 21:07:53	Neocraftz1553	not a problem, just curious

2016-02-13 21:12:44	Yoshi2	if I had to sum this archive format up, it'd be
2016-02-13 21:12:59	Yoshi2	4 bytes section ID as ascii letters
2016-02-13 21:13:07	Yoshi2	4 bytes data length coming after it
2016-02-13 21:13:18	Yoshi2	and the rest being data I don't have the slighest clue about
2016-02-13 21:14:04	@Espyo	full documentation:
2016-02-13 21:14:14	@Espyo	Section ID (ASCII) — 4 bytes
2016-02-13 21:14:21	@Espyo	Data length — 4 bytes
2016-02-13 21:14:26	@Espyo	Data — N bytes
2016-02-13 21:14:34	Yoshi2	q.e.d.
2016-02-13 21:14:35	@Espyo	there, 100% undeniable full documentation for the archive format
2016-02-13 21:14:44	@Espyo	in theory, that is literally all you need
2016-02-13 21:14:48	Yoshi2	well, it is a bit more interesting than that
2016-02-13 21:15:02	Yoshi2	for example each section has subsections which have a similar format
2016-02-13 21:15:07	Yoshi2	so it is sort of recursive
2016-02-13 21:15:33	@Espyo	filed under "data"
2016-02-13 21:19:09	Yoshi2	so if I want to modify the format, I need to change the data size recursively for each section whose size has changed
2016-02-13 21:19:26	@Espyo	eep
2016-02-13 21:19:43	Yoshi2	... I will come up with some idea eventually
2016-02-13 21:25:38	@Espyo	got dinner now, but let me just ask something real quick
2016-02-13 21:25:54	@Espyo	now that you have SOME GameCube assembly reverse-engineering experience, Yoshi2
2016-02-13 21:26:06	@Espyo	how hard do you think it would be to obtain the formula that controls the carrying speed of an object?
2016-02-13 21:26:09	@Espyo	probably an insane question
2016-02-13 21:26:11	Chiaki_Nanami	are Portuguese dinners as late as Spanish dinners?
2016-02-13 21:26:22	@Espyo	well, they're not really "late"
2016-02-13 21:26:28	@Espyo	it's 21:30 over here
2016-02-13 21:26:36	Chiaki_Nanami	That's late to me
2016-02-13 21:26:37	@Espyo	...ok that, IS late, even for Portuguese standards
2016-02-13 21:26:43	@Espyo	my family always dined late
2016-02-13 21:26:46	Chiaki_Nanami	ah
2016-02-13 21:26:54	@Espyo	but I guess all around the world, the average dining hour is around 20:00
2016-02-13 21:26:58	@Espyo	dinner now, brb
2016-02-13 21:27:12	Chiaki_Nanami	in sweden its 19:00
2016-02-13 21:27:19	Yoshi2	you could ask me "How hard would it be to obtain XYZ?" and my answer to that would be: not particulary easy
2016-02-13 21:27:49	Chiaki_Nanami	How hard would it be to obtain a glass of water?
2016-02-13 21:28:05	Yoshi2	Chiaki_Nanami: not particulary easy
2016-02-13 21:28:22	Yoshi2	it requires you having to stand up, going to the kitchen and find a glass, and fill that glass with water
2016-02-13 21:29:49	Chiaki_Nanami	sounds tricky
2016-02-13 21:29:53	Chiaki_Nanami	but u can do it
2016-02-13 21:30:25	Yoshi2	naaah, just think of all the dangers
2016-02-13 21:30:38	Yoshi2	you might trip over an object
2016-02-13 21:30:50	Yoshi2	thus spilling the water and maybe even breaking the glass
2016-02-13 21:31:02	Chiaki_Nanami	just use GarbageCollect
2016-02-13 21:35:51	En_Passant	It's usually 18:00-19:00 in the US
2016-02-13 21:36:11	En_Passant	People who like to dine early do 17:00

2016-02-13 21:49:48	@Espyo	your answer looks like a one-panel SMBC strip

2016-02-13 21:50:20	@Espyo	and the panel would show an example
2016-02-13 21:51:20	Yoshi2	ok, I was able to confirm one thing about this bw archive format
2016-02-13 21:51:38	Yoshi2	it is not called RXET despite RXET being the first 4 bytes of the file
2016-02-13 21:51:51	Yoshi2	rxet is just the name of a section containing texture data
2016-02-13 21:52:02	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-02-13 21:52:09	Yoshi2	so this format has no header

2016-02-14 02:49:21	Chiaki_Nanami	ive been feeling sort of depressed recently which is why I've spent so little time here

2016-02-14 02:52:48	@PikFan	then suddenly the sky got dark
2016-02-14 02:53:00	@PikFan	moments later, there were many explosions going off in the sky

2016-02-14 05:33:11	En_Passant	Have you figured out the meaning of your game's title yet?
2016-02-14 05:33:29	@PikFan	no
2016-02-14 05:33:40	@PikFan	still probably going to rename it at some point
2016-02-14 05:34:22	@PikFan	I blame my preteen mind for its strangeness
2016-02-14 05:34:38	@PikFan	...I blame my preteen mind for ALL of my game's strangeness
2016-02-14 05:35:20	@PikFan	the logic behind the title was that Hocotate was colonizing the Pikmin Planet, hence the "connection"
2016-02-14 05:35:50	@PikFan	then as time went on, I realized that was crappy logic, because several other games also have colonies
2016-02-14 05:36:04	@PikFan	but I never bothered to rename it to something better
2016-02-14 05:38:14	@PikFan	I'd like to rename it to something along the lines of Pikmin: Ambition, and though it's nice and short, I'm still unsure about it
2016-02-14 05:39:23	@PikFan	I dunno, I
2016-02-14 05:39:38	@PikFan	*I dunno, I'm just really bad with names in general
2016-02-14 05:40:16	@PikFan	like, Pikmin: Mysterious World could use some reworking

2016-02-14 05:40:54	En_Passant	That's the sequel, right?
2016-02-14 05:41:02	@PikFan	and besides, it's just a really bland name

2016-02-14 05:54:38	En_Passant	The thing with the titles, I think, is that they're not quite related to the game's content

2016-02-14 05:58:29	En_Passant	Forever works despite being a word because it follows with that theme of "time", in a way
2016-02-14 05:59:23	En_Passant	The canon games are the Xth encounter, Forever gives that sense of finality
2016-02-14 05:59:29	En_Passant	That's my interpretation
2016-02-14 06:00:07	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-14 06:00:41	@PikFan	and then your game is just 5, but with a Roman numeral to distinguish it from other Pikmin 5s
2016-02-14 06:01:03	En_Passant	Kind of. I pronounce it as the letter
2016-02-14 06:01:14	@PikFan	really? me too!
2016-02-14 06:01:39	En_Passant	It's weird, because we just read Henry V in English
2016-02-14 06:02:12	En_Passant	And that's unmistakably "the Fifth"

2016-02-14 13:05:43	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-14 13:06:55	Yoshi2	ok, so in python I cannot make a memoryview of a file object
2016-02-14 13:07:04	Yoshi2	but I can make a file object from a memoryview
2016-02-14 13:07:20	Yoshi2	fine by me, I guess
2016-02-14 13:09:10	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-02-14 13:15:38	Yoshi2	the way I imagine this should allow for a minimum of copying
2016-02-14 13:18:33	Yoshi2	and a minimum of redundancy
2016-02-14 13:19:15	Klemen702	Alright
2016-02-14 13:19:19	Klemen702	fixed all borders

2016-02-14 13:24:07	Yoshi2	Klemen702: some variant of the risk boardgame?
2016-02-14 13:28:49	Klemen702	is that your guess?
2016-02-14 13:28:50	Klemen702	well
2016-02-14 13:28:52	Klemen702	not correct
2016-02-14 13:28:53	Klemen702	if it is
2016-02-14 13:29:21	Yoshi2	do I get a free second guess if I say that it wasn't my guess? :P
2016-02-14 13:29:31	Klemen702	there are infinite guesses

2016-02-14 16:24:13	Yoshi2	I wonder what would be the best way to demonstrate this archive editing
2016-02-14 16:24:36	Yoshi2	probably if I added elements from one archive into another
2016-02-14 16:24:55	Yoshi2	one of the downsides of this format is that units used in one mission cannot necessarily be used in another mission
2016-02-14 16:26:33	@Espyo	drat
2016-02-14 16:28:02	Yoshi2	so the only way to do it is if I moved the resource data from one archive to another
2016-02-14 16:28:18	Yoshi2	and copied the necessary xml data into the other xml file
2016-02-14 16:28:39	Testyo	I have ...
2016-02-14 16:31:47	Yoshi2	the graph I showed yesterday visualized the object dependencies
2016-02-14 16:32:32	Yoshi2	I'll have to do a graph search starting with the object I want to move
2016-02-14 16:32:38	@Espyo	right
2016-02-14 16:52:01	@Espyo	ok, that's it
2016-02-14 16:52:14	@Espyo	without figuring out what the equation is from the game itself
2016-02-14 16:52:20	@Espyo	it's not possible to understand carrying speeds in Pikmin 2
2016-02-14 16:52:32	@Espyo	I'll add my findings to the talk page, write what little can be concluded on the wiki page
2016-02-14 16:52:34	@Espyo	and call it a day
2016-02-14 16:52:41	@Espyo	and try my own equation for the engine
2016-02-14 16:56:21	Yoshi2	that reminds me, I should make a graph of the pikmin2 assembler code
2016-02-14 16:57:30	@Espyo	yeah, go for it
2016-02-14 16:59:29	Yoshi2	the hierarchy code I have here is a complete mess

2016-02-14 17:50:49	@Espyo	except games I made
2016-02-14 17:50:54	@Espyo	because of course, my own code makes total sense

2016-02-14 17:55:11	Yoshi2	there is no way this spaghetti code is the result of a compiler
2016-02-14 17:55:21	Yoshi2	the pikmin 2 developers surely made it into spaghetti
2016-02-14 17:55:29	@Espyo	of course
2016-02-14 17:55:58	Yoshi2	I think we should rally the internet against the pik2 devs

2016-02-14 18:25:20	@Espyo	captions should also end in periods
2016-02-14 18:25:21	nvortex	i didn't add them because i thought they were unnecesary but ok
2016-02-14 18:25:35	@Espyo	remember that you don't need to memorize all of these policies, the "Check for problems" button does that for you
2016-02-14 18:25:48	@Espyo	yeah they're unecessary, but we have captions EVERYWHERE on the wiki, that not having them makes it look like we forgot or something

2016-02-14 19:59:32	nvortex	has scruffy been in this chat recently?
2016-02-14 19:59:51	@Espyo	yep
2016-02-14 19:59:51	Yoshi2	yup, yesterday iirc
2016-02-14 19:59:53	@Espyo	pretty much every day
2016-02-14 20:00:21	nvortex	i wanted to ask him stuff about his nightmode
2016-02-14 20:00:26	nvortex	looks gud
2016-02-14 20:00:33	Yoshi2	hm, this program is slightly better in terms of memory usage
2016-02-14 20:00:42	Yoshi2	but it feels slower
2016-02-14 20:00:54	@Espyo	there had to be a tradeoff
2016-02-14 20:03:40	Yoshi2	I can feel my cpu melting away
2016-02-14 20:11:43	Chiaki_Nanami	reboot
2016-02-14 20:11:58	@Espyo	WOW this is hard
2016-02-14 20:12:08	@Espyo	even trying to make my own equation for how carrying speeds work is a pain
2016-02-14 20:12:16	@Espyo	I could have a simple base speed
2016-02-14 20:12:22	@Espyo	and every Pikmin that gets added increases the speed
2016-02-14 20:12:26	@Espyo	depending on its type and maturity
2016-02-14 20:12:38	@Espyo	but if this addition is too small, the new Pikmin doesn't make much of a difference
2016-02-14 20:12:57	@Espyo	but if it's too big, I soon find 5 Pikmin carrying a 5-pellet to go faster than what they normally run
2016-02-14 20:13:15	Yoshi2	what should the maximum and minimu speed be?
2016-02-14 20:13:22	@Espyo	I'm not sure
2016-02-14 20:13:24	@Espyo	it's all about balance
2016-02-14 20:13:25	Yoshi2	*minimum
2016-02-14 20:13:29	Yoshi2	yeah
2016-02-14 20:13:32	@Espyo	although I'd say the maximum shouldn't go past the Pikmin's running speed
2016-02-14 20:13:38	@Espyo	but like, what if there are Purples and Whites carrying?
2016-02-14 20:13:45	@Espyo	what if there's like 19 Whites and 1 Purple?
2016-02-14 20:13:48	@Espyo	they should go fast
2016-02-14 20:13:55	@Espyo	but does that mean the Purple goes faster than what it normally moves?
2016-02-14 20:14:05	@Espyo	if not, should the 19 Whites really be dragged down by the 1 Purple?
2016-02-14 20:14:11	@Espyo	hmmm... that might actually not be a bad idea
2016-02-14 20:14:22	@Espyo	want to carry this thing? your choice, you either carry it quickly, or with few Pikmin
2016-02-14 20:14:27	@Espyo	that's why Purples and Whites have different jobs
2016-02-14 20:15:06	@Espyo	so, maybe the maximum speed should be the speed of the slowest Pikmin in the group
2016-02-14 20:15:37	@Espyo	which can be achieved if the object has the max number of carriers on it, and they're all flower
2016-02-14 20:15:51	@Espyo	I guess that makes sense
2016-02-14 20:15:56	@Espyo	I'll also have to add some factor for the weight of the object
2016-02-14 20:16:07	@Espyo	since if it worked like I just said in Pikmin 2...
2016-02-14 20:16:19	@Espyo	then the dumbbell in the Wistful Wild would only take like 20 seconds to deliver
2016-02-14 20:16:23	@Espyo	and not a quarter of the day
2016-02-14 20:16:54	nvortex	i dont understand anything but yes, the purple moves faster
2016-02-14 20:17:14	@Espyo	yeah, I think that's true in Pikmin 2
2016-02-14 20:17:16	@Espyo	probably Pikmin 3 too
2016-02-14 20:17:27	@Espyo	but I can't do the same on the engine because it's so complex
2016-02-14 20:17:34	@Espyo	plus, I'm thinking maybe it wouldn't make sense
2016-02-14 20:17:40	@Espyo	where does the Purple get that speed from?
2016-02-14 20:17:54	@Espyo	does it just stop running and just hangs on to the object?
2016-02-14 20:17:56	@Espyo	that's dumb
2016-02-14 20:17:59	Yoshi2	yes
2016-02-14 20:18:13	nvortex	[dont know anything about programming] what if the object is the one with speed and pikmin are just there to activate it or whatever
2016-02-14 20:18:18	@Espyo	suddenly, the object goes from being 20/10 to being 10/20
2016-02-14 20:18:30	@Espyo	that's how I'm making it, yeah
2016-02-14 20:18:38	@Espyo	but you know how the more Pikmin you add to the object, the faster it goes?
2016-02-14 20:18:40	@Espyo	and all that jazz?
2016-02-14 20:18:43	nvortex	yeah
2016-02-14 20:18:44	@Espyo	I have to find a way to get that final speed
2016-02-14 20:18:50	@Espyo	based on the number of Pikmin, their types, their maturity, etc.
2016-02-14 20:19:37	nvortex	i wish i knew about programming
2016-02-14 20:19:44	@Espyo	it's fun
2016-02-14 20:19:55	nvortex	i dont thin i ca learn where i live
2016-02-14 20:20:03	nvortex	can learn that*
2016-02-14 20:20:41	@Espyo	you can learn online
2016-02-14 20:21:05	Yoshi2	what espyo is trying to figure out isn't even necessarily programming
2016-02-14 20:21:12	Yoshi2	it's pretty much math
2016-02-14 20:21:41	@Espyo	plus on top of all of this, I have to make it so that the numbers you change are nice to change
2016-02-14 20:21:49	@Espyo	I could just add a bunch of variables and let them be tweaked until it's good
2016-02-14 20:21:50	Yoshi2	well, it's kinda algorithms, I guess
2016-02-14 20:22:03	Yoshi2	it takes a number of pikmin and info about the pikmin and returns a result
2016-02-14 20:22:22	@Espyo	but then if people wanted to add a new type of Pikmin, they'd have to set the "carrying speed", "carrier addition speed multiplier", "carrying speed max delta", etc.
2016-02-14 20:22:32	@Espyo	yep, pretty much
2016-02-14 20:24:24	Yoshi2	this program doesn't work. It plainly does not want to work
2016-02-14 20:24:33	@Espyo	good grief
2016-02-14 20:24:36	@Espyo	is there ANY program that will?
2016-02-14 20:26:01	Yoshi2	well, the other program I tried could do it
2016-02-14 20:26:10	Yoshi2	just ate my ram for breakfast

2016-02-14 21:41:00	Yoshi2	maybe I will try it again tomorrow on my desktop
2016-02-14 21:41:52	@Espyo	yes
2016-02-14 21:41:59	Yoshi2	my desktop might have a better performance with those graphs
2016-02-14 21:42:32	Yoshi2	the selection of layout algorithms is different in this program
2016-02-14 21:42:41	Yoshi2	maybe others can be added by plugins, no idea
2016-02-14 21:43:15	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-14 21:46:23	Yoshi2	quite a work of art, the next algorithm: http://i.imgur.com/Zg9DoAD.png
2016-02-14 21:47:14	Yoshi2	(that is OpenCRD or something like that)
2016-02-14 21:48:58	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-14 21:53:51	Yoshi2	completely useless though
2016-02-14 21:54:34	Yoshi2	I might or might not have to give up on graph visualization
2016-02-14 21:55:27	Yoshi2	or try tools which are designed for larger networks
2016-02-14 21:57:11	Yoshi2	but I feel like I'm done with graphs for a longer while

2016-02-15 20:44:45	Yoshi2	I almost have it figured out how to implement this format reader/writer
2016-02-15 20:45:23	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-02-15 20:46:13	Yoshi2	but not quite
2016-02-15 20:46:28	Yoshi2	I am doing this all fancy with objects, and I'm thinking about the hierarchy
2016-02-15 20:47:11	Yoshi2	a resource file contains sections, each with a name, size and data
2016-02-15 20:47:19	Yoshi2	each section can contain sections
2016-02-15 20:47:38	Yoshi2	so in a way, the resource file is just a section without a name/size (well, the size is the entire file size)
2016-02-15 20:47:50	@Espyo	right, makes sense
2016-02-15 20:48:16	Yoshi2	but a section doesn't have to contain further sections, it might just be a binary blob that needs to be parsed in a different way
2016-02-15 20:50:36	Yoshi2	so the hierarchy, as I imagine it, kinda goes like BinaryBlob (I will think up a better name for it) -> Section - > Archive 
2016-02-15 20:51:15	@Espyo	pretty much
2016-02-15 20:57:36	Yoshi2	so hopefully implementing it will go as well as I imagin
2016-02-15 20:57:39	Yoshi2	*imagine
2016-02-15 21:22:23	Yoshi2	the only aspect that is annoying is how to turn a binary blob into a section
2016-02-15 21:28:15	Yoshi2	hmm, maybe with a "as_section" method
2016-02-15 21:32:36	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-15 21:36:53	Yoshi2	this could actually work
2016-02-15 21:37:04	Yoshi2	when this is done, I will need to do an unit test

2016-02-16 19:00:26	@Espyo	so today I took a bit to think about how to calculate Pikmin speed based on the carriers
2016-02-16 19:00:59	@Espyo	the idea is to, using the number, type, maturity, and status of the carriers, find something that gives a final movement speed
2016-02-16 19:01:14	@Espyo	it has to make sense for the player, it should make sense in real life, and it has to make sense from a challenge perspective
2016-02-16 19:01:22	@Espyo	lots of variables, lots of possible value combinations
2016-02-16 19:01:31	@Espyo	and who's to say the formula I chose is good or not?
2016-02-16 19:01:41	@Espyo	I've spent the past week or so trying to figure out something with all of this in mind
2016-02-16 19:01:49	@Espyo	today, I finally came up with something that I think is the way
2016-02-16 19:01:56	@Espyo	with ALL of that complexity in mind...
2016-02-16 19:02:03	@Espyo	my plan is:
2016-02-16 19:02:14	@Espyo	a) get the average walking speed of all carriers; this is the maximum carrying speed
2016-02-16 19:02:37	@Espyo	b) the more carriers, the closer we get to that maximum speed (all slots taken with carriers = 100% speed)
2016-02-16 19:02:37	@Espyo	DONE
2016-02-16 19:02:39	@Espyo	that's it
2016-02-16 19:02:45	@Espyo	I THINK that something THAT simple is good enough

2016-02-16 19:19:13	Chiaki_Nanami	wow what a boring video id
2016-02-16 19:20:58	@Espyo	yep
2016-02-16 19:26:08	@J	so you didn't want to take the minimum so that adding a fast Pikmin always makes it faster
2016-02-16 19:28:40	@Espyo	I think those were meant to be two sentences
2016-02-16 19:28:50	@Espyo	but yes, adding a fast Pikmin always makes it faster, this way
2016-02-16 19:29:56	@J	it's fine as one sentence
2016-02-16 19:30:07	@J	also, yeah, that seems okay then, only way to know for sure is test it
2016-02-16 19:30:16	@Espyo	definitely
2016-02-16 19:46:40	@Espyo	ok, so I've decided
2016-02-16 19:46:51	@Espyo	I'll buy a new machine in two weeks, where I get the week off
2016-02-16 19:46:56	@Espyo	(or is that three? can't recall)
2016-02-16 19:47:00	@Espyo	and I'm sticking with Linux
2016-02-16 19:47:13	@Espyo	I'll keep windows as well, so I can go there when I need to
2016-02-16 19:47:19	@Espyo	but I'll live my day-to-day life on Linux
2016-02-16 19:47:31	@Espyo	heck, I live most of my waking time on Ubuntu at work, and it's so much better
2016-02-16 19:47:54	@Espyo	windows only works minimally well if you're the type to boot the computer to open a web browser and go on facebook
2016-02-16 19:48:01	@Espyo	if you need to do more than that, you'll have a bad time
2016-02-16 19:48:07	@Espyo	and if you're a developer? it's just a nightmare
2016-02-16 19:48:24	@Espyo	I likely won't need to be pestering you with this or that about Linux, J
2016-02-16 19:48:33	@Espyo	but I do have a few questions
2016-02-16 19:48:40	@Espyo	for one thing, how do you do it when you get a new computer?
2016-02-16 19:49:16	@Espyo	do you buy something used and format it, or do you buy a packaged machine from a regular electronics store, and format that?
2016-02-16 19:49:26	@Espyo	or do you get something with a blank disk?
2016-02-16 19:54:47	Yoshi2	I formatted the new HDD I bought and repartitioned it
2016-02-16 19:54:56	Yoshi2	two data partitions and one partition for linux
2016-02-16 19:55:19	@Espyo	but you only bought an HDD, right?
2016-02-16 19:55:27	@Espyo	I'm thinking of a completely new machine
2016-02-16 19:56:19	Yoshi2	well, with a completely new machine it wouldn't be too different
2016-02-16 19:56:37	Yoshi2	though in my case, I wanted a setup with windows on my old hdd, and linux on the other
2016-02-16 19:57:10	@Espyo	right
2016-02-16 19:57:17	Yoshi2	if I only had one hdd, I'd probably repartition the hdd so that one partition could be used for linux
2016-02-16 19:57:58	Yoshi2	from what I've heard, it's a better idea to install windows first, and then do linux
2016-02-16 19:58:15	@Espyo	yeah, I think I read that before as well, actually
2016-02-16 19:58:20	@Espyo	...it wouldn't surprise me
2016-02-16 20:38:47	@J	oh, sorry, I was busy and will be for a while
2016-02-16 20:38:50	@J	I'll read later
2016-02-16 20:39:55	@Espyo	hm, ok
2016-02-16 20:48:49	Yoshi2	no excuses, if you have time to respond, you have time to read ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-02-16 20:50:03	@Espyo	yuuuuuup
2016-02-16 20:50:18	@Espyo	ok, just as I figured, the algorithm wouldn't be THAT simple
2016-02-16 20:50:18	@Espyo	but
2016-02-16 20:50:23	@Espyo	it looks like that's the way
2016-02-16 20:51:25	Yoshi2	the only aspects of it that are set in stone is that the maximum speed should be the average speed of all pikmin, and that adding more pikmin should bring the speed closer to the maximum
2016-02-16 20:51:44	Yoshi2	and there are a million ways as to how a value can approach a maximum
2016-02-16 20:52:48	Yoshi2	and neat, jet set radio is free right now on steam
2016-02-16 20:53:11	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-16 20:53:21	@Espyo	I went with as something as simple as counting how many carriers there are
2016-02-16 20:53:29	@Espyo	but it looks like I'll need some extra parameters to tweak stuff up
2016-02-16 20:53:41	@Espyo	all slots filled with carriers makes an object move too fast
2016-02-16 20:54:11	@Espyo	and I guess it makes sense that even with the load lifted to half, you wouldn't move as fast as you would move normally
2016-02-16 20:54:31	@Espyo	(20/20 carriers, weight being 10, means every Pikmin is lifting half of their strength)
2016-02-16 20:54:39	@Espyo	(let's not add Purples into this)
2016-02-16 20:54:40	@Espyo	(please)
2016-02-16 20:54:56	@Espyo	(help, I added Purples to it in my mind)
2016-02-16 20:55:29	@Espyo	I'll just add a simple cap multiplier
2016-02-16 20:55:43	@Espyo	like, although the average speed is the "ideal" speed goal, I'll shrink it to only 80%
2016-02-16 20:55:52	@Espyo	plus there's some other parameters
2016-02-16 20:56:06	@Espyo	how quickly the speed grows from one Pikmin to all carriers
2016-02-16 20:56:09	@Espyo	since it can't start at 0
2016-02-16 20:56:14	@Espyo	otherwise objects with 1 carrier wouldn't move
2016-02-16 20:56:29	@Espyo	or alternately, objects with one carrier would move at half speed, objects with 2 would move at full speed
2016-02-16 20:56:31	@Espyo	and that looks janky
2016-02-16 20:56:44	@Espyo	finally, I added one more multiplier to slow down the overall progress the heavier the object is
2016-02-16 20:56:51	@Espyo	should help for stuff like the Doomsday Apparatus

2016-02-16 21:04:09	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-16 21:04:21	@Espyo	good GRIEF the weight penalty has to be something like 0.0004
2016-02-16 21:04:40	@Espyo	grab the max speed, remove 0.0004 times the weight, in percentage
2016-02-16 21:04:55	@Espyo	meaning that an object at weight 1, and one at weight 2 will suffer no notable difference
2016-02-16 21:05:11	@Espyo	but 1000 weight will drop down to nearly half
2016-02-16 21:05:14	@Espyo	so... Doomsday Apparatus
2016-02-16 21:05:26	@Espyo	working with really crazy numbers, over here

2016-02-16 21:06:44	Neocraftz1553	So it is harder than it sounds
2016-02-16 21:07:27	Yoshi2	it is harder than it sounds
2016-02-16 21:07:47	@Espyo	it always is
2016-02-16 21:07:50	@Espyo	but luckily, it's going fine
2016-02-16 21:07:56	@Espyo	...which it shouldn't
2016-02-16 21:08:06	@Espyo	so that can only mean that eventually I'll find one scenario where my equation doesn't work AT ALL
2016-02-16 21:08:32	Neocraftz1553	and then you'll have to rework it...

2016-02-16 21:11:47	Neocraftz1553	don't they lose interest in the object once it gets farther away?

2016-02-16 22:03:22	@Espyo	yeah, it's going fine
2016-02-16 22:03:24	@Espyo	it's almost done
2016-02-16 22:03:32	@Espyo	and after this, I'll add a new enemy, tweak a few things, and make a release
2016-02-16 22:03:41	Neocraftz1553	ok, cool!
2016-02-16 22:05:12	Neocraftz1553	Then all thats left is Hazards, Plants, Water, Most menus, Music, Most sound effects, Sprays, Story mode cutscenes and Story mode progression
2016-02-16 22:05:23	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-16 22:05:38	Neocraftz1553	there is still alot
2016-02-16 22:06:08	Neocraftz1553	Hello Chiaki_Nanami
2016-02-16 22:06:22	@Espyo	well, if I didn't forget anything in that list, which I probably did... then yeah
2016-02-16 22:06:31	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-16 22:06:55	Neocraftz1553	More Enemy Modifiers(The Text Files)
2016-02-16 22:07:11	@Espyo	enemies are pretty flexible as-is at the moment
2016-02-16 22:07:14	@Espyo	because of scripting
2016-02-16 22:07:25	Neocraftz1553	like the max amount of Pikmin they can eat and stuff
2016-02-16 22:07:33	Neocraftz1553	or is that already implemented
2016-02-16 22:07:57	@Espyo	already implemented
2016-02-16 22:08:04	Neocraftz1553	I can't really think of anything else for the Engine at the moment

2016-02-16 22:08:25	@Espyo	I'm sure it'll come up

2016-02-16 22:13:18	@Espyo	but I'm actually thinking of doing a fan-made enemy
2016-02-16 22:13:22	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-16 22:13:28	@Espyo	what's everybody's favorite original enemy?
2016-02-16 22:13:39	@Espyo	well, one that doesn't involve mechanics that haven't been made yet, like hazards

2016-02-16 23:28:03	@J	I have a little time to answer that stuff if you're still here?
2016-02-16 23:28:58	@J	looks like Yoshi answered some stuff
2016-02-16 23:29:32	@J	I don't know so much about dual-booting with Windows nowadays, as since Secure Boot / UEFI became a thing I've never had a Windows installation
2016-02-16 23:29:57	@J	though I expect the major distributions work pretty easily with it now, you'll probably just have to disable Secure Boot (or add custom keys)
2016-02-16 23:31:12	@J	other than that it's really easy, installers just shrink the Windows partition as you want
2016-02-16 23:31:44	@J	then to boot, you install a bootloader than chains to the Windows bootloader
2016-02-16 23:32:06	@J	for the likes of Ubuntu, this just happens, you just have to select the correct HDD to install the top-level bootloader on
2016-02-16 23:38:48	@Espyo	here
2016-02-16 23:39:12	@Espyo	right
2016-02-16 23:39:21	@Espyo	actually, I tried dual-booting with Ubuntu in the past
2016-02-16 23:39:24	@Espyo	the laptop before this one, I think?
2016-02-16 23:39:30	@Espyo	it worked fine, with GRUB
2016-02-16 23:39:38	@Espyo	I just didn't use Linux much at the time
2016-02-16 23:39:43	@Espyo	I meant more like in terms of hardware
2016-02-16 23:40:06	@Espyo	I guess what I'm really asking is how easily do you find a machine available with a blank hard drive, so you can install whatever you want?
2016-02-16 23:40:30	@Espyo	because if I buy a computer from a store, it'll come with windows, but that means I'll be paying some extra because of licenses and such, compared to a blank drive
2016-02-16 23:40:33	@Espyo	at least that's what I'm thinking
2016-02-16 23:40:39	@J	if you want Windows, you probably want to buy with Windows, then add Linux
2016-02-16 23:40:48	@J	you said you want Windows too, right?
2016-02-16 23:40:58	@J	or are you saying you already have a license or something
2016-02-16 23:41:00	@Espyo	I can just install windows 7 with a CD I have lying around
2016-02-16 23:41:10	@J	oh, okay
2016-02-16 23:41:18	@Espyo	(at least I think I do; I should check)
2016-02-16 23:41:22	@J	mm, there's probably not many places that do it anyway, I guess
2016-02-16 23:41:44	@J	and places that do would probably be the sort of places that are charging extra for customisations
2016-02-16 23:41:45	@Espyo	yeah, that's what I was thinking
2016-02-16 23:42:06	@J	that's what I did: https://www.scan.co.uk/3xs/
2016-02-16 23:42:26	@J	because I wasn't buying anything crazy-expensive, and I don't have any money problems
2016-02-16 23:42:38	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-02-16 23:42:42	@Espyo	I'll bookmark it, thanks
2016-02-16 23:43:21	@J	I also looked at pcspecialist.co.uk, but the way their site works it's harder to tell if the result will actually have compatible hardware, sufficient power supply, etc.
2016-02-16 23:43:35	@J	Scan makes it much easier if you don't really know hardware
2016-02-16 23:47:21	@J	okay, I'm off to sleep then, goodnight
2016-02-16 23:48:36	@Espyo	night
2016-02-16 23:48:42	@Espyo	yeah, I'm no hardware wiz
2016-02-16 23:48:51	@Espyo	really wish I knew hardware-related stuff better
2016-02-16 23:49:21	@Espyo	every time I buy a decent-priced computer, I learn one or two months later that that hunk of junk is bad even for the previous year's standards

2016-02-16 23:53:56	ScruffyChat	Hey I was wondering, it might be a while before I actually create something relevant
2016-02-16 23:54:03	@Espyo	relevant?
2016-02-16 23:54:10	ScruffyChat	But would you be willing to help me test the game I'm creating
2016-02-16 23:54:18	@Espyo	Up Late?
2016-02-16 23:54:20	ScruffyChat	Once it comes along?
2016-02-16 23:54:25	ScruffyChat	The other one
2016-02-16 23:54:31	ScruffyChat	The original video game
2016-02-16 23:54:44	@Espyo	I...have a vague memory of you speaking of this
2016-02-16 23:54:45	ScruffyChat	I can build it for Windows and Dropbox it to you
2016-02-16 23:54:47	@Espyo	but I'm not...
2016-02-16 23:54:51	@Espyo	the Unity one?
2016-02-16 23:54:53	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-02-16 23:55:00	@Espyo	I can't remember any details
2016-02-16 23:55:01	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-16 23:55:13	ScruffyChat	That's okay, there aren't any details yet
2016-02-16 23:55:16	@Espyo	uh, to my defence, 10 minutes ago was the first time in my life I played Master System
2016-02-16 23:55:22	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-02-16 23:55:41	@Espyo	so I guess you could say I'm still starstruck
2016-02-16 23:55:47	@Espyo	nah, but sure, I can test
2016-02-16 23:55:59	@Espyo	maybe I won't be able to test for too long at a time
2016-02-16 23:56:11	@Espyo	but being a software developer, I know what kind of problems to look for
2016-02-16 23:56:17	ScruffyChat	That's no problem
2016-02-16 23:56:18	@Espyo	so in terms of beta testing, I may not go long, but I go deep
2016-02-16 23:56:19	ScruffyChat	Thank you!

2016-02-17 00:01:49	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-02-17 00:01:50	@Espyo	honestly, my brother in law had it lying around, asked me to see if it worked
2016-02-17 00:01:54	@Espyo	but it didn't have a cable
2016-02-17 00:02:00	@Espyo	so happy to see it work, it was quite the experience
2016-02-17 00:02:04	@Espyo	oh, nice

2016-02-17 00:02:10	ScruffyChat	What did you play on it?
2016-02-17 00:02:24	@Espyo	the only game he had, Sonic the Hedgehog
2016-02-17 00:02:29	ScruffyChat	Classic
2016-02-17 00:02:32	@Espyo	certainly more wonky compared to Sonic on the Mega Drive, that's for sure

2016-02-17 16:15:08	Yoshi2	the main point is that it needs to be mouse-drawn and there is no anti-aliasing 
2016-02-17 16:17:36	Yoshi2	which makes sense, because the original polandball comics were done like that

2016-02-17 19:37:11	@Espyo	plus if I need the likes of 3DS Max
2016-02-17 19:37:15	@Espyo	or other windows-exclusive tools
2016-02-17 19:37:33	@Espyo	but other than that, most of my day-to-day tools are multiplatform or have Linux alternatives
2016-02-17 19:37:37	@Espyo	so good riddance
2016-02-17 19:37:51	@J	I was just wondering if it was an 'if' or there's actually something you use right now
2016-02-17 19:38:23	@J	the only thing I can think of for me is games, and a surprising number of those run fine on Wine
2016-02-17 19:38:30	@J	even modern 3D games
2016-02-17 19:38:34	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-02-17 19:38:40	@Espyo	yeah, I keep hearing Wine is good
2016-02-17 19:38:54	@Espyo	but from my VERY SMALL personal experience, some programs that should run great aren't so hot
2016-02-17 19:38:57	@Espyo	like Winamp
2016-02-17 19:39:06	@Espyo	I love Winamp, but when I tried running it at work for curiosity
2016-02-17 19:39:09	@J	it really depends on what the program does
2016-02-17 19:39:14	@Espyo	it worked, but crashed here and there
2016-02-17 19:39:21	@Espyo	but then, I know my engine runs 100%
2016-02-17 19:39:26	@J	plus Wine is under heavy development, stuff sometimes improves drastically in a few months
2016-02-17 19:39:30	@Espyo	I also tried Knytt today, and also 100%
2016-02-17 19:39:35	@Espyo	oh, is it?
2016-02-17 19:39:36	@Espyo	good to know
2016-02-17 19:40:05	@J	I chose not to dual boot, because I knew I just wouldn't bother to reboot to play specific games
2016-02-17 19:40:20	@J	that was already the case on my laptop for a few years
2016-02-17 19:40:35	@Espyo	exactly
2016-02-17 19:40:37	@Espyo	I feel that too
2016-02-17 19:40:44	@Espyo	but... there might be times when I need it
2016-02-17 19:40:50	@Espyo	so it can't hurt to have it lying around
2016-02-17 19:40:53	@Espyo	even if it's just gathering dust

2016-02-17 20:26:32	@Espyo	the texture makes it look like it's made of clay
2016-02-17 20:26:37	@Espyo	the bumps might be a bit too pronounced
2016-02-17 20:26:50	@Espyo	other than that, it's great, besides the horrible background :|
2016-02-17 20:27:01	ScruffyChat	How did you light the scene? Using the background?
2016-02-17 20:27:08	ScruffyChat	Or with a regular light
2016-02-17 20:29:19	Neocraftz1553	I used both
2016-02-17 20:29:38	Neocraftz1553	thanks for the criticism Espyo
2016-02-17 20:29:46	Neocraftz1553	heh, I know, the background is terrible
2016-02-17 20:30:37	@Espyo	you're welcome
2016-02-17 20:31:22	ScruffyChat	You may want to increase the power of the regular light
2016-02-17 20:31:38	ScruffyChat	There's no shadows, it seems a bit like indoor lighting
2016-02-17 20:31:53	ScruffyChat	There are*

2016-02-17 20:37:01	ScruffyChat	It might be to your advantage to mix in a little Translucent Shader
2016-02-17 20:37:20	ScruffyChat	Most plants have some degree of translucency and scatter light, not just reflect it
2016-02-17 20:37:37	ScruffyChat	Or at least, most flowers do

2016-02-17 20:58:26	Yoshi2	memview of a string isn't writeable
2016-02-17 20:58:37	Yoshi2	which means I should read the data from the file into an array
2016-02-17 20:58:44	Yoshi2	then create a memview of the array

2016-02-17 22:06:01	Yoshi2	so for some reason, the memoryview loses data as I read more of the data

2016-02-17 22:06:42	Yoshi2	the file object that runs on top of the memory view is still fine, I think
2016-02-17 22:06:50	Yoshi2	but the memory itself is not, wat
2016-02-17 22:14:29	Yoshi2	ok, I figured it out
2016-02-17 22:15:34	Yoshi2	was an error on my part, due to two overlapping variable names
2016-02-17 22:15:56	@Espyo	oh
2016-02-17 22:15:57	@Espyo	youch
2016-02-17 22:16:01	Yoshi2	one variable was supposed to be used for the memory view of the entire file, and one was to be used for a small part of the file
2016-02-17 22:16:16	Yoshi2	but both had the same name, and this was in a for loop
2016-02-17 22:16:53	Yoshi2	so as the iteration went on, the memview became smaller and smaller, until it became non-existant
2016-02-17 22:16:59	@Espyo	right
2016-02-17 22:28:31	Yoshi2	success, my test worked
2016-02-17 22:28:42	@Espyo	woop

2016-02-18 20:43:30	Yoshi2	step 1: rename BattWarsArchive to BattWarsArchiveBase
2016-02-18 20:44:21	Yoshi2	because then I can do BWArchive and BWiiArchive that actually handle the game-dependent parsing

2016-02-18 21:24:08	Yoshi2	are they different?
2016-02-18 21:24:12	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-02-18 21:24:25	ScruffyChat	I think they made them homogenous so that player's wouldn't question if different shapes meant different stats
2016-02-18 21:24:33	Yoshi2	in that picture it looks like it might just be the different angles
2016-02-18 21:24:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-18 21:24:44	Neocraftz1553	but look closely'
2016-02-18 21:24:56	Neocraftz1553	one is hexagonal
2016-02-18 21:25:06	Neocraftz1553	shorter and stouter
2016-02-18 21:25:31	Neocraftz1553	that one, players would question the stats
2016-02-18 21:25:40	Neocraftz1553	since it seems kinda denser
2016-02-18 21:25:49	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-02-18 21:26:28	Yoshi2	hmm, I do see it now
2016-02-18 21:27:33	Neocraftz1553	then theres a rounder one
2016-02-18 21:27:50	Neocraftz1553	just behind the first one

2016-02-19 00:33:53	ScruffyChat	Very few of them will be in the same spot
2016-02-19 00:35:20	nvortex	like the can in the beginning of the game?
2016-02-19 00:35:24	nvortex	or the duracell battery
2016-02-19 00:36:39	ScruffyChat	The duracell battery will be in the same spot, the can won't, for example
2016-02-19 00:37:39	nvortex	if treasures were to return in pikmin 4, do you think nintendo will use real life brands?
2016-02-19 00:37:45	nvortex	i have a feeling they wont....
2016-02-19 00:37:47	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-02-19 00:38:00	nvortex	i hope they do, they gave a nice touch to the gae

2016-02-19 00:38:10	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2016-02-19 00:39:55	nvortex	i dont know...they could have added real life phones in 3 but they didnt...
2016-02-19 00:40:16	nvortex	its not like the glass bottle in 1 because its just that, a glass bottle
2016-02-19 00:40:32	nvortex	a phone is something more special
2016-02-19 00:41:13	ScruffyChat	True, but that was also a very specific type of bottle
2016-02-19 00:42:20	ScruffyChat	It was a Ramune bottle, which would easily be recognized in Japan
2016-02-19 00:43:36	nvortex	but ramune bottles are a type of bottle (right?) its not just a brand who sells soda
2016-02-19 00:44:27	ScruffyChat	Ramune is a brand that sells soda
2016-02-19 00:44:34	ScruffyChat	And their known for bottles like that
2016-02-19 00:45:09	nvortex	yeah but im talking about the type of bottle
2016-02-19 00:45:23	nvortex	or is ramune the only one that sell it?
2016-02-19 00:45:41	ScruffyChat	no, other brands can create that bottle
2016-02-19 00:46:01	nvortex	thats what i mean, in pikmin 1 its just a ramune *type* bottle
2016-02-19 00:46:01	ScruffyChat	But in Japan, that bottle would be immediately associated with Ramune
2016-02-19 00:46:06	nvortex	ok
2016-02-19 00:46:07	ScruffyChat	Ah I see
2016-02-19 00:46:34	ScruffyChat	Well, yes, I did notice Pikmin and Pikmin 3 just used /suggestive/ treasures rather than real brand
2016-02-19 00:46:38	ScruffyChat	brands*
2016-02-19 00:47:09	ScruffyChat	I do hope they bring back some brand name objects, but it might have been too much work to do in Pikmin 2
2016-02-19 00:47:31	ScruffyChat	Since they had to create and place different treasures for each region
2016-02-19 00:47:45	ScruffyChat	In order for them to be recognized
2016-02-19 00:47:54	nvortex	yeah
2016-02-19 00:48:00	nvortex	ugh i really hope they do
2016-02-19 00:48:21	ScruffyChat	But then again, who knows what we'll be collecting
2016-02-19 00:48:29	nvortex	if they can censor...i mean /localize/ characters in america, they can change brands too

2016-02-19 21:06:26	Yoshi2	hm yes, python 2's str is the equivalent of bytes
2016-02-19 21:08:23	Yoshi2	lots of confusion was had due to python 2 having the unicode type and the str type
2016-02-19 21:08:55	Yoshi2	python 3 made unicode the str type, and the str type became bytes, which imo makes more sense

2016-02-20 12:34:52	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-02-20 12:34:53	Testyo	espyo is probably busy with work and other things most of the map implementer?
2016-02-20 12:36:42	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-20 12:36:50	@Espyo	thanks for answering for me, Testyo
2016-02-20 12:36:51	Testyo	have you can obviously see it's harder
2016-02-20 12:36:58	@Espyo	harder map implementer

2016-02-20 12:40:45	@Espyo	woop!
2016-02-20 12:41:23	@Espyo	finally, other life forms
2016-02-20 12:43:40	Yoshi2	indeed
2016-02-20 12:59:27	Yoshi2	the archive format is much more straightforward now that I simplified the code like this
2016-02-20 12:59:49	@Espyo	good
2016-02-20 13:03:27	Yoshi2	zzz, what is it with the developers changing the endianness all the time
2016-02-20 13:04:09	Yoshi2	pretty easily noticable when numbers are suddenly 00 00 CD AB instead of AB CD 00 00 
2016-02-20 13:05:36	@Espyo	hah
2016-02-20 13:05:41	@Espyo	that's so stupid
2016-02-20 13:08:05	Yoshi2	well, figuring out the model format is still beyond me, so ¯\(ツ)/¯  
2016-02-20 13:16:04	Yoshi2	hmmm, maybe this is not model data after all
2016-02-20 13:16:13	Yoshi2	does ET_Bird_Chirp_4 sound like a model? :>
2016-02-20 13:16:35	@Espyo	if you have visible onomatopoeias in that game, yeah
2016-02-20 13:16:39	@Espyo	if not...............nope
2016-02-20 13:17:37	Yoshi2	the piece of data is called DPSD
2016-02-20 13:17:52	Yoshi2	could be a typo of DSPD, and DSP would be sound-related
2016-02-20 13:18:05	Yoshi2	but then, where are the models? :V
2016-02-20 13:20:04	@Espyo	procedurally generated
2016-02-20 13:22:08	Yoshi2	this is no joke, where is the model data
2016-02-20 13:22:10	Yoshi2	i am scared
2016-02-20 13:23:13	Yoshi2	I printed the names of the data, and it looks like sound data
2016-02-20 13:23:22	Yoshi2	which is cool, but not what I am looking for
2016-02-20 13:23:57	Yoshi2	I swear, if the model data ends up being compiled into the game executable
2016-02-20 13:24:18	Yoshi2	I will be partly excited but also wtf'ing like hell
2016-02-20 13:25:49	Yoshi2	ok, crisis averted
2016-02-20 13:26:15	Yoshi2	DPSD is sound data, and the model data is in the other sections I haven't checked out yet
2016-02-20 13:26:24	 *	Yoshi2 renames his code
2016-02-20 13:27:19	@Espyo	it... can't be inside the executable
2016-02-20 13:27:20	@Espyo	that's too insane
2016-02-20 13:27:25	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-02-20 13:40:12	Yoshi2	LDOM, MINA, PRCS, FEQT
2016-02-20 13:42:01	Yoshi2	mystery names
2016-02-20 13:50:45	Yoshi2	ok, wtf is this
2016-02-20 13:51:00	Yoshi2	Espyo: FEQT data is actually readable with a text editor: http://pastebin.com/TEiC7wjV
2016-02-20 13:51:55	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-02-20 13:53:02	Yoshi2	seems to be particles
2016-02-20 13:53:24	Yoshi2	I have no idea how that format works
2016-02-20 13:54:00	Yoshi2	somebody with more time than me should figure that out
2016-02-20 13:57:40	Yoshi2	LDOM seems to be model data and MINA seems to be model data/animation data/bone data
2016-02-20 13:57:53	Yoshi2	PRCS is scripts
2016-02-20 13:59:42	Yoshi2	mystery solved, my work is done, time to be a useless piece of crap for the rest of my life ヽ(°▽ °)ノ

2016-02-20 14:08:57	@Espyo	still more progress now than before
2016-02-20 14:08:59	Yoshi2	i cannot let down that one person who is interested in modding the game
2016-02-20 14:09:01	@Espyo	so technically...
2016-02-20 14:13:23	Yoshi2	no breaks for me until I have made enough progress to call it a day
2016-02-20 14:14:11	@Espyo	heh, all right
2016-02-20 14:14:13	@Espyo	that's the spirit
2016-02-20 14:31:32	Yoshi2	FEQT unpacking/packing done, woohoo
2016-02-20 14:32:43	Yoshi2	mostly because I wanted to retrieve the name of the particles so I can at some point move around the necessary particles
2016-02-20 14:33:41	Yoshi2	going to do the same for the remaining data, and then I will try to go for a proof of concept to bring units from one level into another level
2016-02-20 14:39:49	@Espyo	good luck
2016-02-20 14:43:08	Yoshi2	thanks
2016-02-20 15:04:20	Yoshi2	MINA done
2016-02-20 15:04:49	Yoshi2	seems like the animation is only for human units and not for vehicles
2016-02-20 15:05:54	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-20 15:08:52	Yoshi2	so there is a section called LDOM, and one of the entries in that section is LDOM
2016-02-20 15:10:18	@Espyo	oooooh boy
2016-02-20 15:10:40	Yoshi2	well, it's not recursive
2016-02-20 15:10:52	@Espyo	so it's just confusing?
2016-02-20 15:11:05	Yoshi2	that second LDOM section just spans the rest of the first LDOM section
2016-02-20 15:11:15	Yoshi2	it's just confusing
2016-02-20 15:13:16	@Espyo	good grief
2016-02-20 15:13:42	Yoshi2	"just confusing" is the least to be said about the entire thing

2016-02-20 16:38:36	Yoshi2	I did get the model name out of this, so that's all that will matter for now
2016-02-20 16:40:48	@Espyo	right
2016-02-20 16:46:50	Yoshi2	next step, that script section

2016-02-20 16:49:43	@Espyo	hehe
2016-02-20 16:57:03	Yoshi2	the script section might actually contain compiled lua, but I'm not yet sure about the format
2016-02-20 16:58:54	Yoshi2	it's something like Constants - Strings/function names - compiled code
2016-02-20 17:07:08	Yoshi2	I should confirm that it contains lua code by running the code-like part of it through a disassembler
2016-02-20 17:09:01	Yoshi2	which I will probably write myself
2016-02-20 17:09:24	@Espyo	yay

2016-02-20 19:29:11	Yoshi2	automation was a success
2016-02-20 19:29:15	Yoshi2	let's see how long it took
2016-02-20 19:29:35	Yoshi2	[19:11:38] <Yoshi2> hm, I think I will automate this part
2016-02-20 19:29:41	Yoshi2	and it's 20:29 now
2016-02-20 19:29:44	Yoshi2	not tooo bad
2016-02-20 19:31:52	Yoshi2	I probably would've been done with it by now if I did it by hand, but this was less mind numbing
2016-02-20 19:32:25	@Espyo	for sure
2016-02-20 19:35:42	--	UltraMario|Sleep is now known as UltraMario
2016-02-20 19:42:55	Yoshi2	suddenly, all the strings in this script section are 0 terminated
2016-02-20 19:43:07	Yoshi2	but still have the length prefix which includes the zero byte at the end
2016-02-20 19:45:23	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-20 19:45:27	@Espyo	redundant much?
2016-02-20 19:51:16	Yoshi2	there is probably some technical reason for that
2016-02-20 19:51:45	Yoshi2	like strings having to be 0-terminated
2016-02-20 19:59:44	Testyo	OH through a cloud
2016-02-20 20:02:57	@Espyo	yeah, but if there's already a length byte, it's kinda pointless
2016-02-20 20:59:00	Yoshi2	I am I am very confused about this
2016-02-20 21:00:05	@Espyo	you're so confused, you typed "I am" twice
2016-02-20 21:01:15	Yoshi2	it kinda could be lua bytecode, but I haven't yet figured out how to parse it correctly

2016-02-20 21:24:45	Yoshi2	ok, this looks kind of promising: http://pastebin.com/6BtX6nvg
2016-02-20 21:25:26	Yoshi2	the values in the brackets are (opcode, A, B, C)
2016-02-20 21:25:29	@Espyo	definitely

2016-02-20 21:30:44	@Espyo	DO add a keyboard shortcut to toggle between using that variable, and using that variable times 4

2016-02-20 21:40:48	Yoshi2	sBx is a 18 bit signed value, but the docs hasn't said much about how the signed thing is done
2016-02-20 21:53:47	Yoshi2	wow, one of the doc files I was reading lied to me
2016-02-20 21:54:51	Yoshi2	it said the instruction order was Opcode|A|B|C, but the newer docs said that in 5.0.2, the instruction order was Opcode|C|B|A
2016-02-20 21:55:11	Yoshi2	and I feel like the newer documentation is right
2016-02-20 21:59:14	@Espyo	wow

2016-02-21 19:05:48	ScruffyChat	I had gotten red berries from the Burgeoning Spiderworts in the Awakening Wood, and they grew back, so I went to get some more
2016-02-21 19:06:11	ScruffyChat	I had taken down about 8 of the ten
2016-02-21 19:06:16	ScruffyChat	And then they grew back
2016-02-21 19:06:34	ScruffyChat	Normally it takes a lot longer, but they grew back right then
2016-02-21 19:06:54	@Espyo	hm, the Spiderworts might regrow based on the time of day
2016-02-21 19:06:55	ScruffyChat	And because my Pikmin were already attacking one of the Spiderworts, one of the new berries spawned already on the ground
2016-02-21 19:07:05	@Espyo	like, regrow a full stock at exactly this, that, and that time of the day
2016-02-21 19:07:20	ScruffyChat	eah
2016-02-21 19:07:53	ScruffyChat	But it was just weird seeing a berry expand from nowhere, already knocked off the plant

2016-02-22 18:58:54	Yoshi2	hype, I have made some progress on my migration code for moving resources from one level to another
2016-02-22 18:59:33	@Espyo	hype
2016-02-22 19:00:24	Yoshi2	I also confirmed that object IDs are very consistent with each level, so I can reduce the amount of resources being moved by checking which ones already exist in the target archive
2016-02-22 19:02:29	@Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:24001 wow
2016-02-22 19:02:41	@Espyo	this is the loudest public display of cancer I've heard on wikia as of today

2016-02-22 19:06:56	UltraMario	;P
2016-02-22 19:08:14	@Espyo	that it is
2016-02-22 19:08:24	@Espyo	can you imagine NIWA being bested by a travel agency wikia?

2016-02-22 19:09:07	UltraMario	i just wish kirby wikia was merged with wikirby
2016-02-22 19:09:15	UltraMario	because it's actually better
2016-02-22 19:09:17	UltraMario	:p
2016-02-22 19:09:19	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-02-22 19:09:25	UltraMario	it deserves better than to be a wikia
2016-02-22 19:09:38	UltraMario	wikirby kinda sucks tbh
2016-02-22 19:09:45	UltraMario	last time i went there there was red links everywhere
2016-02-22 19:09:46	UltraMario	:P
2016-02-22 19:09:54	UltraMario	and lots of stubs
2016-02-22 19:10:35	UltraMario	although that was years ago, i imagine it still hasnt chaged much

2016-02-22 19:12:43	UltraMario	Espyo: so it's still lacking? :p
2016-02-22 19:12:52	@Espyo	I'd imagine so
2016-02-22 19:12:54	@Espyo	never checked
2016-02-22 19:12:55	UltraMario	rip wikirby
2016-02-22 19:13:20	UltraMario	someone needs to merge those two somehow, although i dont have much hope for it being succesful
2016-02-22 19:13:31	UltraMario	because wikia is greedy af
2016-02-22 19:13:59	@Espyo	mhm
2016-02-22 19:15:08	UltraMario	another good wikia is sonic news network
2016-02-22 19:16:08	@Espyo	but Sonic Retro is pretty good too
2016-02-22 19:17:51	UltraMario	true
2016-02-22 19:18:17	UltraMario	although it's a bit lacking in terms of newer games i think
2016-02-22 19:20:17	@Espyo	it is
2016-02-22 19:21:23	UltraMario	random question
2016-02-22 19:22:04	UltraMario	if you connected an hdmi to a tv and a laptop with a broken lcd display, would it display right on the tv?
2016-02-22 19:22:22	@Espyo	it would, but you need to press the key combo to switch screens
2016-02-22 19:22:31	@Espyo	check your laptop's F keys
2016-02-22 19:22:33	@Espyo	F1, F2, etc.
2016-02-22 19:22:37	UltraMario	i think windows 10 has a button to d-
2016-02-22 19:22:38	UltraMario	yah
2016-02-22 19:22:45	@Espyo	you probably need to hold Fn + whatever F key has what looks like a monitor
2016-02-22 19:22:50	@Espyo	then just keep pressing till you see something
2016-02-22 19:22:52	@Espyo	if you're lucky
2016-02-22 19:22:53	UltraMario	it's f4 i think
2016-02-22 19:23:01	@Espyo	it's never consistent
2016-02-22 19:23:01	UltraMario	how much are hdmis?
2016-02-22 19:23:03	UltraMario	ono
2016-02-22 19:23:08	UltraMario	so it wont work good? D:
2016-02-22 19:23:13	@Espyo	it will

2016-02-22 19:23:20	@Espyo	I just mean that getting it to work the first time is always hit-or-miss
2016-02-22 19:23:24	UltraMario	ah i see
2016-02-22 19:23:25	@Espyo	HDMI cables are stupid expensive
2016-02-22 19:23:28	UltraMario	ono
2016-02-22 19:23:35	UltraMario	good ones? :(
2016-02-22 19:24:23	@Espyo	all of them, I'd say
2016-02-22 19:24:33	@Espyo	if you have a Wii U, it comes with one
2016-02-22 19:24:57	Yoshi2	for the most part, as long as a cable supports what you need and has the length you need, any cable works
2016-02-22 19:25:21	UltraMario	so there's no difference in quality between cables besides length quality and whatnot?
2016-02-22 19:25:32	UltraMario	i just want a good picture :p
2016-02-22 19:26:26	UltraMario	i hope that's the case

2016-02-22 19:48:35	UltraMario	as far as compatability goes, would it be easy to get an hdmi that works with my laptop?

2016-02-22 19:52:18	Yoshi2	so you know what it means when the product description says hdmi 2.0 or hdmi 1.4
2016-02-22 19:53:44	UltraMario	im not sure which mine is compatible with
2016-02-22 19:54:10	Yoshi2	doesn't matter
2016-02-22 19:54:15	UltraMario	probably whatever's the newest
2016-02-22 19:54:17	UltraMario	im just saying :p
2016-02-22 19:54:32	Yoshi2	just means you can't use the coolest features of the newer hdmi versions

2016-02-22 19:54:46	UltraMario	:(
2016-02-22 19:56:29	Yoshi2	you won't need the features of the newer versions anyway, so if a 2.0 cable costs too much you can go for a 1.4 one

2016-02-22 20:21:47	UltraMario	so does the hdmi work with any program on the screen?
2016-02-22 20:21:48	UltraMario	:o

2016-02-22 20:26:36	@Espyo	the computer doesn't care where it's showing the images to
2016-02-22 20:26:41	@Espyo	could be the LCD on your laptop
2016-02-22 20:26:42	@Espyo	a TV
2016-02-22 20:26:45	@Espyo	an external monitor
2016-02-22 20:26:47	@Espyo	whatever you tell it
2016-02-22 20:26:53	@Espyo	this is true regardless of operative system too
2016-02-22 20:26:58	@Espyo	heck, you can probably even route the BIOS
2016-02-22 20:27:10	UltraMario	:OOO
2016-02-22 20:27:36	UltraMario	will the picture look better tho?
2016-02-22 20:27:47	Yoshi2	if your monitor is good, sure
2016-02-22 20:27:50	@Espyo	if your monitor has a higher resolution than your LCD display, yes
2016-02-22 20:28:00	UltraMario	the tv is hd so i assume it would
2016-02-22 20:28:02	UltraMario	the tv is bigger
2016-02-22 20:28:10	@Espyo	then yeah
2016-02-22 20:28:13	UltraMario	not sure about the picture quality being better but it probably is
2016-02-22 20:28:14	UltraMario	hooray

2016-02-22 20:28:37	@Espyo	it's a major step up
2016-02-22 20:28:43	UltraMario	eventuallyyyyyyy
2016-02-22 20:28:48	Yoshi2	Espyo: ugh, I just noticed that I was rebuilding the wrong files
2016-02-22 20:28:50	UltraMario	also i havent beaten the first one yet either, so

2016-02-22 20:30:04	Yoshi2	(not really but the average joe probably can't do 14 minutes)
2016-02-22 20:30:04	@Espyo	you'll summon Miles

2016-02-22 20:33:08	@PikFan	hi
2016-02-22 20:33:14	@Espyo	oh, convenient
2016-02-22 20:33:17	@Espyo	sent ya a memo
2016-02-22 20:33:23	@PikFan	yep
2016-02-22 20:33:30	@Espyo	see, I want to add a new enemy for the next release
2016-02-22 20:33:30	@PikFan	decide a new enemy for the engine?
2016-02-22 20:33:32	@PikFan	ah
2016-02-22 20:33:35	@Espyo	I could just pick one from the list
2016-02-22 20:33:35	@Espyo	but
2016-02-22 20:33:46	@Espyo	I figured that, to show the power of the engine, I could create a fan-made enemy
2016-02-22 20:33:53	@Espyo	well, one that can use the mechanics that exist right now
2016-02-22 20:33:54	@Espyo	so no hazards
2016-02-22 20:33:58	@PikFan	hm
2016-02-22 20:33:59	@Espyo	chomping, attacking, etc.
2016-02-22 20:34:12	@Espyo	you should be able to help me decide what is the community's favorite fan-enemy
2016-02-22 20:34:25	@Espyo	if not, I'll just go with one of yours
2016-02-22 20:34:34	@Espyo	or whomever steps forward to request
2016-02-22 20:34:47	@Espyo	but you know, if it's a popular fan-enemy, all the better
2016-02-22 20:34:48	@PikFan	holy http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/c/c9/Phosbat_at_the_Piano.png
2016-02-22 20:35:11	@PikFan	oh, are you able to do bosses?
2016-02-22 20:35:17	@Espyo	eeeeeeehhhhhh...
2016-02-22 20:35:20	@Espyo	not if they're too complex
2016-02-22 20:35:23	@Espyo	but I can try
2016-02-22 20:35:30	@Espyo	yeah, Scruffy's silly
2016-02-22 20:35:32	@PikFan	maybe an Emperor Bulblax?
2016-02-22 20:35:36	@Espyo	he said the idea popped up, so he just made it quickly
2016-02-22 20:35:39	@PikFan	or a Burrowing Snagret
2016-02-22 20:35:42	@Espyo	like I said, it should be a fan-made enemy
2016-02-22 20:35:50	@Espyo	to show off how the engine can do not only canon enemies, but fan mechanics too
2016-02-22 20:35:55	@PikFan	right
2016-02-22 20:36:10	@Espyo	I think I could do a Snagret easily
2016-02-22 20:36:13	nvortex	maybe a poll for the fanon?
2016-02-22 20:36:14	@Espyo	Emperor Bulblax, slightly less easily

2016-02-22 20:36:33	@Espyo	it's not that important, I can just pick whatever enemy
2016-02-22 20:36:41	@Espyo	plus the point IS for other people to make their own enemies, not me
2016-02-22 20:36:51	@Espyo	I just bundle them in so people can have a starting point and also something to play around with

2016-02-22 20:38:19	@Espyo	yeah, but giving up so soon?
2016-02-22 20:38:23	@Espyo	there's gotta be a popular enemy
2016-02-22 20:38:30	@Espyo	like, there are popular Pikmin, like Cyan and Green

2016-02-22 20:39:21	@Espyo	just like I thought
2016-02-22 20:39:27	UltraMario	another random question

2016-02-22 20:45:29	Yoshi2	recolors are boooooooring
2016-02-22 20:45:36	@Espyo	I just want something that can show how the engine doesn't just allow the canon enemies to be created
2016-02-22 20:45:41	@PikFan	I agree
2016-02-22 20:45:45	@Espyo	but with the right scripts, you can create an enemy that does a lot more

2016-02-22 20:45:50	@Espyo	hm, I could always make my own enemy

2016-02-22 20:46:44	@Espyo	I didn't grow up with Pokémon, so I asked a friend to decide for me
2016-02-22 20:46:45	@PikFan	it's funny, because I was on this great winning streak
2016-02-22 20:46:47	@Espyo	Team Blue FTW
2016-02-22 20:46:57	@PikFan	carried me all the way to Champion
2016-02-22 20:47:04	@Espyo	Team Red just did awful in general
2016-02-22 20:47:09	@PikFan	then bam, started getting tons of Level 50 enemies left and right
2016-02-22 20:47:10	@Espyo	I had so many matches where I destroyed the other team
2016-02-22 20:47:17	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-02-22 20:47:17	@Espyo	weird
2016-02-22 20:47:20	@Espyo	I kept getting low-levels
2016-02-22 20:47:21	@PikFan	I ragequit so hard
2016-02-22 20:47:23	@Espyo	on both teams, to be frank
2016-02-22 20:47:28	@Espyo	eh, it's just Sea Snails
2016-02-22 20:47:30	@Espyo	I have like 125
2016-02-22 20:47:31	@Espyo	don't use 'em
2016-02-22 20:47:33	@PikFan	I ended up kicking a table over
2016-02-22 20:47:36	@Espyo	easy there
2016-02-22 20:47:56	@Espyo	it's worse when it's the lag that gets you
2016-02-22 20:48:02	@PikFan	I was getting really upset that I was losing to so many level 50's
2016-02-22 20:48:06	@PikFan	and different ones each time
2016-02-22 20:48:09	@Espyo	when you get defeated by players with a higher skill level, yeah, that sucks, but it's life
2016-02-22 20:48:18	@Espyo	but when lag makes your incredible escape and epic KO into a stupid trade
2016-02-22 20:48:23	@Espyo	that's infuriating
2016-02-22 20:48:28	@PikFan	right
2016-02-22 20:48:44	@PikFan	what else is infuriating is that you keep losing to different ones every
2016-02-22 20:48:44	@PikFan	single
2016-02-22 20:48:46	@PikFan	time
2016-02-22 20:48:52	@PikFan	I don't mind losing sometimes
2016-02-22 20:48:56	@Espyo	that doesn't sound quite right
2016-02-22 20:49:07	@Espyo	I see quite a few level 50s that are actually pretty pathetic
2016-02-22 20:49:10	@PikFan	but no, I was losing every time, all to different teams
2016-02-22 20:49:17	@Espyo	you just had a streak of bad luck
2016-02-22 20:49:24	@PikFan	oh, right, I forgot something
2016-02-22 20:49:30	@PikFan	my teammates kept disconnecting :|
2016-02-22 20:49:37	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-02-22 20:49:40	@Espyo	that's Splatfest for you
2016-02-22 20:49:46	@PikFan	half the matches I had one or two of my teammates disconnect :|

2016-02-22 20:49:58	@Espyo	but not necessarily my team
2016-02-22 20:50:26	@PikFan	see, if this were some other Splatfest, I'd figure out which team was less popular
2016-02-22 20:50:42	@PikFan	but since I didn't grow up with Pokemon, I had no way of knowing
2016-02-22 20:50:46	@Espyo	right
2016-02-22 20:50:52	UltraMario	everyone probably voted red
2016-02-22 20:50:53	UltraMario	because
2016-02-22 20:50:54	@PikFan	I picked Red because it was Callie
2016-02-22 20:50:56	UltraMario	charizard is overrated
2016-02-22 20:50:57	UltraMario	:p
2016-02-22 20:51:03	@Espyo	but you could've thought that Red —
2016-02-22 20:51:04	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-02-22 20:51:06	UltraMario	yup
2016-02-22 20:51:07	@PikFan	*Callie's team, because Callie usually wins splatfest
2016-02-22 20:51:08	@Espyo	everybody is a Charizard fanboy
2016-02-22 20:51:11	@Espyo	fire is SOOOOO COOL OMG
2016-02-22 20:51:15	UltraMario	well
2016-02-22 20:51:20	@PikFan	lol, really?
2016-02-22 20:51:22	UltraMario	i like him but there are better fire starts

2016-02-22 20:51:24	UltraMario	yes
2016-02-22 20:51:24	@PikFan	I didn't know
2016-02-22 20:51:29	UltraMario	he's one of the most overrated pokemno
2016-02-22 20:51:31	UltraMario	*pokemon
2016-02-22 20:51:31	UltraMario	:p
2016-02-22 20:51:42	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-22 20:51:49	@PikFan	urgh
2016-02-22 20:51:57	@PikFan	I should've gone with team blue
2016-02-22 20:52:01	@Espyo	but at least you stood true with Callie
2016-02-22 20:52:02	@PikFan	blue is my favorite color anyway
2016-02-22 20:52:04	@Espyo	the objectively best Squid Sister
2016-02-22 20:52:08	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-22 20:52:12	@Espyo	and anybody who says otherwise is a heathen

2016-02-22 20:53:18	@PikFan	I can't choose between Callie and Marie though
2016-02-22 20:53:21	@PikFan	I like them both
2016-02-22 20:53:25	@Espyo	yeah, to be honest
2016-02-22 20:53:29	@Espyo	they're such likable characters
2016-02-22 20:53:34	@Espyo	*likeable
2016-02-22 20:53:40	@Espyo	but Marie always favors the crappier stuff
2016-02-22 20:53:40	UltraMario	well
2016-02-22 20:53:43	@PikFan	I like Callie's excitable personality, but I also like Marie's reserved personality
2016-02-22 20:53:48	@Espyo	Fit or Rich, picking money mumble grumble
2016-02-22 20:53:56	UltraMario	marie isnt very likable for me because she's a bitch to callie
2016-02-22 20:53:56	Testyo	I hope you've vented off your anger by swearing, friend.
2016-02-22 20:53:57	UltraMario	:p
2016-02-22 20:54:01	UltraMario	she can be funny but
2016-02-22 20:54:03	@Espyo	yeah, that's true, actually
2016-02-22 20:54:05	UltraMario	she picks on her too much
2016-02-22 20:54:05	UltraMario	;w;
2016-02-22 20:54:06	@Espyo	it's banter, but wow

2016-02-22 20:54:13	@PikFan	there's actually a fanfiction out there where a love triangle forms between Callie, Marie, and an Octarian
2016-02-22 20:54:19	@Espyo	just one?
2016-02-22 20:54:22	@Espyo	probably dozens

2016-02-22 20:54:29	@Espyo	hehe
2016-02-22 20:54:34	@PikFan	no, just one in particular
2016-02-22 20:54:36	UltraMario	also callie is cute :>
2016-02-22 20:54:47	UltraMario	and looks sort of like bayonetta
2016-02-22 20:54:55	@PikFan	and... Marie almost commits suicide in the fanfiction o.o

2016-02-22 21:58:22	@Espyo	which game?
2016-02-22 21:58:33	Neocraftz1553	P3
2016-02-22 21:58:52	@Espyo	no, but I can get it
2016-02-22 21:59:00	Neocraftz1553	You could get P1 and 2 models?
2016-02-22 21:59:04	@Espyo	well, not P1
2016-02-22 21:59:09	@Espyo	but P1's model is the same as P2
2016-02-22 21:59:11	@Espyo	and I can get P2
2016-02-22 21:59:39	Neocraftz1553	I was going to ask for the Emporer Bulblax model from P1
2016-02-22 21:59:48	@Espyo	nope, no known way at the moment
2016-02-22 22:00:00	Neocraftz1553	thought so...
2016-02-22 22:00:20	Neocraftz1553	Can you get Area models?
2016-02-22 22:00:43	@Espyo	P2 only
2016-02-22 22:00:44	@Espyo	do not
2016-02-22 22:00:45	@Espyo	ever
2016-02-22 22:00:46	@Espyo	in your life
2016-02-22 22:00:47	@Espyo	attempt
2016-02-22 22:00:48	@Espyo	to even
2016-02-22 22:00:51	@Espyo	begin to think about
2016-02-22 22:00:55	@Espyo	opening a P3 area model
2016-02-22 22:01:04	Neocraftz1553	heh, ok
2016-02-22 22:01:09	@Espyo	imagine polygon vomit
2016-02-22 22:01:13	@Espyo	all piled up in the same spot
2016-02-22 22:01:17	@Espyo	that's what areas in P3 are stored as
2016-02-22 22:01:24	@Espyo	or at least, that's how the 3DS Max script loads them as
2016-02-22 22:01:24	Neocraftz1553	damn
2016-02-22 22:01:40	Neocraftz1553	ok, can you get caves, then
2016-02-22 22:01:43	@Espyo	I think it's every "room" bundled together, plus the outsides of every "room"
2016-02-22 22:01:49	@Espyo	well, let me try to rephrase that
2016-02-22 22:01:56	@Espyo	if you use the radar to pan and look at the TV screen
2016-02-22 22:01:59	@Espyo	you see the area as it is
2016-02-22 22:02:02	@Espyo	but if you go to a different room
2016-02-22 22:02:10	@Espyo	you can see the outside of that room that is part of the other room
2016-02-22 22:02:16	@Espyo	so there are two version of each room
2016-02-22 22:02:28	@Espyo	the actual room, and the version you see on the TV when using the radar while on a different room
2016-02-22 22:02:31	@Espyo	so all of that is bundled together
2016-02-22 22:02:45	@Espyo	"room" is the parts of the area that make the screen transition when you go from one to the other
2016-02-22 22:02:59	@Espyo	hm, I might be able to get Mission Mode stages
2016-02-22 22:03:01	@Espyo	and Bingo Battle
2016-02-22 22:03:06	Neocraftz1553	WOW
2016-02-22 22:03:09	@Espyo	P2 caves are impossible, since they're made out of [[cave unit]]s

2016-02-22 22:04:03	Neocraftz1553	Pileated Snagret, Giant Breadbug, Breadbug...
2016-02-22 22:04:22	@Espyo	are these requests?

2016-02-22 22:04:35	Neocraftz1553	yes...
2016-02-22 22:04:47	@Espyo	hm, okay, I'll take care of them when I can
2016-02-22 22:04:50	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-22 22:04:54	@Espyo	P2 area models aren't that great
2016-02-22 22:04:58	@Espyo	like
2016-02-22 22:05:00	Neocraftz1553	let me list them in paste bin then
2016-02-22 22:05:00	@Espyo	they are
2016-02-22 22:05:03	@Espyo	but they're weird to load
2016-02-22 22:05:04	@Espyo	yeah, might as well
2016-02-22 22:05:10	@Espyo	please don't ask for too many... I'll die
2016-02-22 22:05:15	Neocraftz1553	ok, P2 area models last
2016-02-22 22:05:18	Neocraftz1553	heh, sorry
2016-02-22 22:05:21	@Espyo	but on the other hand, ask for the ones you DO need now
2016-02-22 22:05:29	@Espyo	because a few weeks from now, I'll get a new computer
2016-02-22 22:05:36	Neocraftz1553	ok, Burrowing Snagret
2016-02-22 22:05:38	@Espyo	and I probably won't install 3DS Max unless I really need to
2016-02-22 22:06:08	Neocraftz1553	I have the model, but for some reason it didn't come with the textures
2016-02-22 22:06:15	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-22 22:06:22	@Espyo	P3?
2016-02-22 22:06:28	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-22 22:06:35	@Espyo	well, might as well make a pastebin
2016-02-22 22:06:37	@Espyo	and I'll just do it all
2016-02-22 22:06:40	Neocraftz1553	and no, I do not have the P3 iso
2016-02-22 22:07:14	@Espyo	it's hell to get it to open
2016-02-22 22:07:16	@Espyo	but I wrote some instructions
2016-02-22 22:07:20	@Espyo	so if you have disk space and time
2016-02-22 22:07:26	@Espyo	you could get the ISO and get all the models you want yourself
2016-02-22 22:07:36	Neocraftz1553	Where do I get an ISO?
2016-02-22 22:07:49	@Espyo	there are some URLs
2016-02-22 22:07:59	@Espyo	but getting the ISO is only like 5% of the entire shebang
2016-02-22 22:08:07	Neocraftz1553	and how big is it?
2016-02-22 22:08:18	Neocraftz1553	I have about 200 gigs free
2016-02-22 22:08:34	Testyo	hm, gonna nice
2016-02-22 22:08:59	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-22 22:09:07	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm
2016-02-22 22:09:07	Testyo	I said hm, gonna nice because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages hm, gonna try Mission Mode and nice.
2016-02-22 22:09:12	@Espyo	the entire process takes like 40 GB
2016-02-22 22:09:18	@Espyo	but the final thing is only like 4GB
2016-02-22 22:09:27	@Espyo	but you'll need a lot of space to manouver a lot of things around
2016-02-22 22:09:32	@Espyo	well, I can give you the instructions then
2016-02-22 22:09:37	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-22 22:09:38	@Espyo	other people followed them before, and they did all right
2016-02-22 22:09:41	@Espyo	so I guess they're easy enough
2016-02-22 22:09:57	Neocraftz1553	ok

2016-02-22 23:19:41	Scruffy	Hi Neo!
2016-02-22 23:26:04	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, I need to ask you something
2016-02-22 23:26:05	Neocraftz1553	How did you do the eyes in your bulborb renders
2016-02-22 23:26:28	Scruffy	The bulborb's eyes come with several layers; because they actually have lenses in Pikmin 3
2016-02-22 23:26:54	Scruffy	I just removed those layers and used the irises already on the eye models
2016-02-22 23:27:42	Scruffy	Sure, it wasn't /exactly/ realistic for the way irises absorb light, but I just used a Glossy shader mixed with Diffuse and a little Subsurface Scattering to get it 
2016-02-22 23:28:01	Scruffy	The Glossy shader's color is defined by the "speq" texture
2016-02-22 23:28:31	Neocraftz1553	Oh, ok
2016-02-22 23:29:00	Neocraftz1553	So you only used one of the lenses
2016-02-22 23:29:25	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-22 23:29:45	Scruffy	It was too difficult to get Cycles to understand if I tried to make the lenses visible but act like glass
2016-02-22 23:30:05	Neocraftz1553	yeah I tried doing that
2016-02-22 23:30:34	Neocraftz1553	So you only used the 2nd layer?
2016-02-22 23:30:47	Neocraftz1553	the one that is "hidden"
2016-02-22 23:30:52	Scruffy	I think so
2016-02-22 23:30:58	Scruffy	I can't remember which layer this was
2016-02-22 23:31:57	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-22 23:32:18	Neocraftz1553	I'll have to try it

2016-02-22 23:44:49	@Espyo	sure, I can send you it
2016-02-22 23:44:51	Scruffy	Hi Espyo
2016-02-22 23:44:53	Scruffy	Thanks!!
2016-02-22 23:44:54	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 actually uses MP3 files
2016-02-22 23:44:57	@Espyo	at least IIRC
2016-02-22 23:45:03	Scruffy	Huh, interesting
2016-02-22 23:45:12	@Espyo	yeah, sounds weird
2016-02-22 23:45:45	@Espyo	oh, damn
2016-02-22 23:45:48	@Espyo	sorry, damn lies
2016-02-22 23:46:00	@Espyo	it's the bfstm format
2016-02-22 23:46:11	Scruffy	Oh, woah
2016-02-22 23:46:24	@Espyo	oh, I was thinking of the cutscenes in Pikmin 3
2016-02-22 23:46:30	@Espyo	THOSE are the ones that use an MPEG format

2016-02-22 23:47:04	@Espyo	hey Scruffy, I've been messing around with my object plotter
2016-02-22 23:47:07	@Espyo	got it to work with Pikmin 2
2016-02-22 23:47:15	Scruffy	Really!
2016-02-22 23:47:17	Scruffy	Awesome
2016-02-22 23:47:18	@Espyo	but having teki 0, teki 1, teki 5, etc. makes it... you know, not very easy to understand
2016-02-22 23:47:22	@Espyo	do you have that list with the teki IDs?
2016-02-22 23:47:25	Scruffy	Ye
2016-02-22 23:47:27	Scruffy	Yes
2016-02-22 23:47:38	@Espyo	send it my way, please
2016-02-22 23:47:41	@Espyo	or put it on the Google Drive
2016-02-22 23:47:43	@Espyo	folder
2016-02-22 23:47:44	@Espyo	thing
2016-02-22 23:47:52	@Espyo	if not, send me it and I'll do it tomorrow during a dead hour at work
2016-02-22 23:47:58	@Espyo	heck, I've been working on this plotter during dead work hours
2016-02-22 23:48:06	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-22 23:48:11	Scruffy	I'll put it in Google Drive
2016-02-22 23:48:15	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2016-02-22 23:48:22	@Espyo	I didn't do much with it, but I think I saw something
2016-02-22 23:48:30	@Espyo	and that is that either I'm not reading enough into the files
2016-02-22 23:48:36	@Espyo	or the Awakening Wood has DOZENS of Pellet Posies
2016-02-22 23:48:37	@Espyo	good grief
2016-02-22 23:48:42	@Espyo	teki 5 seems to be the pellet posy
2016-02-22 23:49:34	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-22 23:49:48	@Espyo	and a few of them are out of bounds
2016-02-22 23:49:52	@Espyo	I have to take a closer look
2016-02-22 23:49:53	@Espyo	brb
2016-02-22 23:49:58	Scruffy	It might take a moment, because I am a dummy who did not initially use a spreadsheet
2016-02-22 23:51:23	En_Passant	Awakening Wood does have a lot of Pellet Posies
2016-02-22 23:52:00	En_Passant	I don't know how spawning works, but I can imagine that some of the ones that "appear" after some time might be hiding out of bounds beforehands
2016-02-22 23:54:55	@Espyo	you can save it as a "word" document
2016-02-22 23:55:00	@Espyo	unless you also have notes for every entry
2016-02-22 23:55:05	@Espyo	in that case, yeah, a table is better
2016-02-22 23:55:12	@Espyo	your call though
2016-02-22 23:55:20	@Espyo	if you're already wrapping it up with the spreadsheet, all the better
2016-02-22 23:55:31	@Espyo	En_Passant: not sure...
2016-02-22 23:57:49	@Espyo	Scruffy: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Perplexing%20Pool.zip
2016-02-22 23:58:10	@Espyo	it's so much faster to export P2
2016-02-22 23:58:33	@Espyo	for one thing, the models are simpler, so stuff moves and loads faster, and the program loads DEFINITELY faster than 3DS Max...
2016-02-23 00:00:46	Scruffy	Thanks dude
2016-02-23 00:01:23	@Espyo	no sweat
2016-02-23 00:03:03	Scruffy	There are still some mysteries here, but this is what I've found

2016-02-23 00:05:02	@Espyo	sweet, thanks
2016-02-23 00:05:27	@Espyo	there's also such a list for "item", "pelt", etc., it seems
2016-02-23 00:05:32	@Espyo	so... we have to figure that out one day
2016-02-23 00:05:42	@Espyo	gotta get going now

2016-02-23 00:07:13	Neocraftz1553	I am back
2016-02-23 00:08:03	En_Passant	lol
2016-02-23 00:08:33	En_Passant	I wonder if spawning 73 would work if you had all five of its treasures
2016-02-23 00:08:58	Scruffy	Perhaps
2016-02-23 00:09:29	Scruffy	But it still can only work /after/ the cutscene where Louie is found
2016-02-23 00:09:53	Scruffy	So to fight one above ground, you'd need to have defeated the one with Louie
2016-02-23 00:10:22	En_Passant	Or at least watched the cutscene
2016-02-23 00:11:01	Scruffy	Right
2016-02-23 00:11:14	En_Passant	Have you tried removing the Titan Dweevil from its normal spot?
2016-02-23 00:12:00	Scruffy	Not yet, I think there's something hard-coded in the 14th sublevel of the Dream Den
2016-02-23 00:12:30	En_Passant	Well... the cutscene, probably
2016-02-23 00:14:15	Neocraftz1553	Oh and Scruffy, I loved the Vehemoth Phosbat Piano render
2016-02-23 00:14:15	Neocraftz1553	It came out so clean
2016-02-23 00:15:42	Scruffy	Thanks
2016-02-23 00:16:09	Scruffy	yeah, I wanted to try a high-sample render for once
2016-02-23 00:16:20	Neocraftz1553	 4,000
2016-02-23 00:17:00	Neocraftz1553	What size Tiles did you use?
2016-02-23 00:17:25	Scruffy	32/32
2016-02-23 00:17:30	Scruffy	That's the default for me
2016-02-23 00:17:39	Scruffy	I don't know if that's optimum though
2016-02-23 00:17:43	Scruffy	But that's what Blender says
2016-02-23 00:17:50	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-02-23 00:19:01	Neocraftz1553	 16/16 has been found to be the Optimum unless you're useing GPU
2016-02-23 00:19:26	Scruffy	Ah
2016-02-23 00:19:46	Scruffy	Well I can't use a GPU, so thank you for telling me!
2016-02-23 00:20:36	Neocraftz1553	Do you have access to GPU rendering?
2016-02-23 00:21:03	Scruffy	No
2016-02-23 00:21:15	Neocraftz1553	It is TONS of times quicker than CPU rendering
2016-02-23 00:21:53	Scruffy	I know
2016-02-23 00:23:28	Scruffy	I don't think I have it though
2016-02-23 00:24:24	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-23 00:24:25	Scruffy	I only have one graphics card
2016-02-23 00:24:38	Neocraftz1553	Try useing 16/16, I have found it renders at least a minute faster
2016-02-23 00:25:56	Scruffy	Nice
2016-02-23 00:26:24	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-02-23 00:26:25	Neocraftz1553	to check, go into user preferences>System>Compute device
2016-02-23 00:26:25	Neocraftz1553	in blender
2016-02-23 00:26:57	Scruffy	There's only CPU
2016-02-23 00:28:37	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-23 00:29:32	Neocraftz1553	http://www.blenderguru.com/articles/4-easy-ways-to-speed-up-cycles/
2016-02-23 00:29:54	Neocraftz1553	Thats where I found my tips on Cycles rendering speeds
2016-02-23 00:30:52	Scruffy	Yeah, I'd need an Nvidia graphics card
2016-02-23 00:31:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-23 00:32:33	Neocraftz1553	intrestingly enough, 16/16 is the slowest rendering tile size using GPU

2016-02-23 19:23:38	@Espyo	and right above it, that request
2016-02-23 19:24:56	@J	I told you I'm using it via IRC, right?

2016-02-23 19:25:08	@J	I'll look at hiding the messages after eating
2016-02-23 19:26:02	@Espyo	oh right, right
2016-02-23 19:26:12	@Espyo	but shouldn't it be split by "channel" or something?
2016-02-23 19:26:23	@Espyo	you just have a constant feed of messages from all over the place all bundled together?
2016-02-23 19:30:09	Yoshi2	I'm incredibly demotivated because my bw project isn't really working out
2016-02-23 19:30:14	Yoshi2	the game really likes to crash
2016-02-23 19:30:21	@Espyo	nuts
2016-02-23 19:30:27	@Espyo	I'm not really feeling much motivation either
2016-02-23 19:30:36	@Espyo	only because the things I'm doing are those really petty parts of code
2016-02-23 19:30:41	@Espyo	that are pretty specific and prone to going wrong
2016-02-23 19:30:42	@Espyo	and sooooo boring
2016-02-23 19:30:51	@Espyo	doesn't look like today is a development day, huh
2016-02-23 19:31:52	Yoshi2	I'll probably just go back and do something smaller
2016-02-23 19:32:07	Yoshi2	like texture replacement
2016-02-23 19:32:09	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-23 19:32:21	@Espyo	J: you know, you should probably say that yes, you're meant to go on the Pikipedia user group
2016-02-23 19:32:28	@Espyo	so far, you only pretty much said you were there
