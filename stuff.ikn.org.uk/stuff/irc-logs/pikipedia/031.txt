2016-06-18 03:25:14	@PikFan	it still looks great
2016-06-18 03:25:17	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-06-18 03:25:58	Scruffy	This is so much fun to do, I can't wait to add other stuff to the scene
2016-06-18 03:26:17	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-18 03:26:26	@PikFan	once I get my own computer, I'm gonna learn Blender
2016-06-18 03:26:48	Scruffy	I'm happy to help you!
2016-06-18 03:26:52	@PikFan	heh, thanks
2016-06-18 03:27:00	@PikFan	I'll probably need it
2016-06-18 03:27:16	@PikFan	also, I feel like a god
2016-06-18 03:27:38	@PikFan	I feel like a god since Marty showed me how to "hack" gear in Splatoon
2016-06-18 03:27:46	Scruffy	Hehehe
2016-06-18 03:27:47	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 03:28:20	@PikFan	I haven't felt like this since I cloned stuff in Animal Crossing: New Leaf
2016-06-18 03:28:33	Marty2000	Oh, Animal Crossing New Leaf
2016-06-18 03:28:39	Marty2000	I have many hack items in that game
2016-06-18 03:28:44	Marty2000	hacked*
2016-06-18 03:28:45	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-18 03:28:51	Marty2000	Like... infinite fruits basket
2016-06-18 03:28:53	Scruffy	I felt that way when I put an Emperor Bulblax in Emergence Cave sublevel 1
2016-06-18 03:29:00	Marty2000	If you still play it, we could exchange them
2016-06-18 03:29:04	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 03:29:09	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-18 03:29:33	@PikFan	how hard is it to hack Pikmin 2?
2016-06-18 03:29:49	@PikFan	don't you just need Dolphin?
2016-06-18 03:30:01	Scruffy	Yes, and a good text editor or hex editor
2016-06-18 03:30:15	@PikFan	hm, I see
2016-06-18 03:30:21	Scruffy	But it depends on what you wish to edit
2016-06-18 03:30:26	Scruffy	Stuff in caves is pretty easy
2016-06-18 03:30:38	Scruffy	Stuff outside is harder, since you have to get the location right
2016-06-18 03:30:49	@PikFan	I hear it's pretty hard to mess with the Titan Dweevil
2016-06-18 03:30:53	Scruffy	parameters are easy to edit if you can find them
2016-06-18 03:31:11	Scruffy	Well, the Titan Dweevil breaks the game if it goes anywhere but Dream Den sublevel 14
2016-06-18 03:31:13	Marty2000	Yeah, the game oftencrashes
2016-06-18 03:31:33	Scruffy	Also I have edited the music but that's the hardest of all
2016-06-18 03:32:07	Scruffy	Since it's just raw data I have to guess what all the text means and change things until I hear a difference/find a pattern
2016-06-18 03:32:33	Marty2000	Let me guess... the music's lenth needs to be the same (or around) as the original one, right?
2016-06-18 03:32:37	Marty2000	length*
2016-06-18 03:32:41	Scruffy	Exactly
2016-06-18 03:33:04	Marty2000	Yoshi2|offline needs the same with Battalion Wars
2016-06-18 03:33:04	Scruffy	And text: I can edit all the in-game text I want but it has to equal the character count of the original
2016-06-18 03:33:28	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-18 03:33:36	Scruffy	Oh, and textures: Dolphin has a feature to both dump textures it finds in the game and load custom textures that use the same names
2016-06-18 03:33:47	Scruffy	So that's convenient for completely changing the look of the game
2016-06-18 03:34:00	Marty2000	Cool
2016-06-18 03:34:03	@PikFan	okay
2016-06-18 03:34:09	@PikFan	I just lagged really really badly
2016-06-18 03:34:15	@PikFan	things were teleporting all over the place
2016-06-18 03:34:27	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-18 03:34:27	Marty2000	What did you hack this time?
2016-06-18 03:34:29	@PikFan	but holy smokes we annihilated the enemy team
2016-06-18 03:34:40	@PikFan	I killed 11 people and didn't die ONCE
2016-06-18 03:34:47	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 03:34:59	@PikFan	and also I had really good teammates
2016-06-18 03:35:09	@PikFan	but dang that was a fun match
2016-06-18 03:36:59	Scruffy	Oh, gotta go
2016-06-18 03:37:06	Marty2000	See you Scruffy

2016-06-18 03:39:06	@PikFan	hmm, I think 4 Ink Recovery Ups are better than 4 Ink Savers
2016-06-18 03:39:09	@PikFan	sorry, I quit

2016-06-18 11:52:21	Marty2000	Hello!
2016-06-18 11:55:11	Marty2000	Yoshi2: could you see the conversation I had with Scruffy and PikFan?
2016-06-18 11:55:38	Marty2000	I don't know if you already knew it, but putting custom music in Pikmin 2 works similarly to Battalion Wars
2016-06-18 11:56:32	Yoshi2	I saw that you stayed up till almost 5 am
2016-06-18 11:57:36	Marty2000	Ah. Well, that was fun. But in Pikmin 2, the custom music needs to have the same length (or around), which is similar to Battalion Wars. I wanted you to know that 
2016-06-18 11:58:00	Marty2000	... unless you knew it :p
2016-06-18 11:58:06	Yoshi2	pikmin 2 likely is much stricter
2016-06-18 11:58:18	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 11:58:29	Yoshi2	I am fairly confident it will be possible to break the length limit in battalion wars
2016-06-18 11:58:41	Yoshi2	because I looked all over the place and saw no limits
2016-06-18 11:59:04	Yoshi2	in fact, I will try something right now
2016-06-18 11:59:12	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 11:59:15	Marty2000	Good luck
2016-06-18 12:00:56	Marty2000	Seems like UltraMario is still sleeping
2016-06-18 12:01:46	Marty2000	Hmm, he left before I did, but I can't remember when... he's probably showing his lazy personnality, currently :D

2016-06-18 12:22:50	Marty2000	You can see the character he used
2016-06-18 12:29:22	Marty2000	Oh, Espyo, by the way, little discovery: in the Spanish version, the Sheargrubs and Puckering Blinnow share a part of their name
2016-06-18 12:29:24	Marty2000	"Comején"

2016-06-18 12:29:57	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-18 12:30:28	Marty2000	So, according to the Spanish version, the Puckering Blinnow and Sheargrubs would be somehow from the same family
2016-06-18 12:30:38	@Espyo	well, not necessarily
2016-06-18 12:30:40	@Espyo	their names make sense
2016-06-18 12:30:44	@Espyo	termite, and aquatic termite
2016-06-18 12:30:47	@Espyo	just like we have lions and sea lions

2016-06-18 12:45:59	Marty2000	Oh that's great, it even looks like it's a cutscene at some points thanks to the camera. Nice!
2016-06-18 12:46:28	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-18 12:46:46	Yoshi2	yup, the cutscene thing is just a flag set on the camera object
2016-06-18 12:50:19	Yoshi2	really odd though, I keep running into issues that make my modding not work on the old dolphin version, while it works on the newest one

2016-06-18 13:17:11	Marty2000	The safe one share the same model as the Inklings for the Kraken, but it doesn't break others' saves
2016-06-18 13:17:22	Marty2000	However, people won't see you as an Octoling
2016-06-18 13:17:23	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-06-18 13:17:42	Marty2000	With the other one, they can see you... but it's really dangerous

2016-06-18 14:04:30	Marty2000	I put a 2000 for the nickname I use in this chatroom because someone already has "Marty"
2016-06-18 14:04:48	Marty2000	But I'm the only Marty on Pikipedia... I suppose
2016-06-18 14:05:15	@Espyo	not chatroom, network

2016-06-18 14:18:04	Yoshi2	one day I should try to memorize the entire navy seal copypasta

2016-06-18 14:20:42	Klemen702	how dare you
2016-06-18 14:20:54	Marty2000	Reminding you of the past is good sometimes
2016-06-18 14:20:55	Klemen702	you did not make the k in CAPS
2016-06-18 14:21:01	Klemen702	that's is brutal
2016-06-18 14:21:13	Marty2000	Yeah, but it's Chiaki_Nanami that atught Testyo this <word
2016-06-18 14:21:14	Testyo	And send the three crewmembers off to get 0 you could run something like, 'remove all the pixels further than x standard deviations from the mean', then compute the standard deviation again
2016-06-18 14:21:30	Klemen702	hmm
2016-06-18 14:21:32	Klemen702	let's see

2016-06-18 14:21:56	Klemen702	but i most likely did
2016-06-18 14:22:15	Marty2000	2016-04-21 18:11:30	Marty2000	You can give a definition :-) 2016-04-21 18:12:01	Chiaki_Nanami	testyo klemen702 means Slovenian memeless kid 2016-04-21 18:12:01	Testyo	Ok, now I know that klemen702 means Slovenian memeless kid.
2016-06-18 14:22:16	Testyo	in fact, we should rename https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/issues/123
2016-06-18 14:52:24	Klemen702	anyone want to see some cool random fan art i found

2016-06-18 14:52:56	Marty2000	I see, cool.

2016-06-18 14:54:35	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-18 15:00:20	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z8kDq-CA Hack is going to spread everywhere
2016-06-18 15:03:50	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-18 15:04:58	@Espyo	https://mii-secure.cdn.nintendo.net/2c23c25z5azww_normal_face.png GAH WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!
2016-06-18 15:05:49	Klemen702	don't post spooky pics
2016-06-18 15:05:50	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-06-18 15:05:53	Klemen702	that's illegal
2016-06-18 15:05:58	@Espyo	spoop
2016-06-18 15:06:10	Marty2000	We're not called Klemen702, you know ;)
2016-06-18 15:07:03	-->	En_Passant (Mibbit@42-788-705-118.hlrn.qwest.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-18 15:07:07	Klemen702	what
2016-06-18 15:09:32	Marty2000	We like spooky pics
2016-06-18 15:09:41	Klemen702	what
2016-06-18 15:09:43	Klemen702	how dare you
2016-06-18 15:09:58	Marty2000	Hi En_Passant
2016-06-18 15:10:06	Klemen702	you are now banned to access the Klemenation
2016-06-18 15:10:18	Marty2000	As UltraMario would say: "Because it's because" ;)
2016-06-18 15:11:19	@Espyo	found so many weird Miiverse posts today
2016-06-18 15:11:23	@Espyo	 20!
2016-06-18 15:11:29	@Espyo	for context, I'll explain
2016-06-18 15:11:41	@Espyo	I wrote a script that automatically scrolls through Miiverse until it reaches last Saturday's posts
2016-06-18 15:11:48	@Espyo	meaning I can see all posts that were made in the past week
2016-06-18 15:11:59	@Espyo	and then I just do ctrl+f for "glitch", "bug", "weird", etc.
2016-06-18 15:12:05	@Espyo	to try to find posts with something interesting in them
2016-06-18 15:12:08	@Espyo	today was a hoot, though
2016-06-18 15:12:09	@Espyo	let's see...
2016-06-18 15:12:13	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z8si7kHQ
2016-06-18 15:12:14	Marty2000	Great
2016-06-18 15:12:54	Marty2000	Heh... how can Pikmin be buried here? Seems it's not near the Onion or the Swooping Snitchbug...
2016-06-18 15:13:10	Marty2000	Actually, it's near the Onion
2016-06-18 15:13:15	@Espyo	looks like the landing site to me, yeah
2016-06-18 15:13:22	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z8gT6MBw :|
2016-06-18 15:13:30	@Espyo	this could've just been taken really close to a wall
2016-06-18 15:13:31	@Espyo	still weird
2016-06-18 15:13:32	Marty2000	Hmm....
2016-06-18 15:13:35	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 15:13:49	Marty2000	I wish we had more explanations, though
2016-06-18 15:13:59	@Espyo	definitely...
2016-06-18 15:14:06	@Espyo	I'll just start asking people
2016-06-18 15:14:24	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 15:14:27	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z84XdbPQ and https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z84M3Zbg
2016-06-18 15:14:35	Marty2000	Good luck, you will probably get few answers
2016-06-18 15:14:45	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-18 15:15:06	Marty2000	These are easy to reproduce
2016-06-18 15:15:11	Marty2000	You just need to throw a leader
2016-06-18 15:15:11	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-18 15:15:21	@Espyo	and there's just solid terrain out there?
2016-06-18 15:15:21	Marty2000	I don't even think it's a glitch...
2016-06-18 15:15:25	@Espyo	that's ridiculous
2016-06-18 15:15:26	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-18 15:15:30	Marty2000	But you cannot escape
2016-06-18 15:15:32	@Espyo	it's like Nintendo WANTS bad things to happen
2016-06-18 15:15:40	@Espyo	this is bad for two reasons: one, it's kind of an exploit
2016-06-18 15:15:43	@Espyo	you're walking on terrain you're not meant to
2016-06-18 15:15:58	Marty2000	And you can't escape...
2016-06-18 15:16:04	@Espyo	two: it takes longer to develop the solid terrain for that, PLUS it makes the game run a bit heavier since it has to run collision checks on places where there shouldn't really be any
2016-06-18 15:16:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-18 15:16:16	@Espyo	it's worth adding to the wiki, though
2016-06-18 15:16:23	@Espyo	can you add it? you seem to know more info about where this is and all
2016-06-18 15:16:34	@Espyo	just a quick mention, probably on trivia, on how the terrain on that part is solid
2016-06-18 15:16:43	Marty2000	Hmm, maybe you'd need a video to show more how this can be reproduced? This won't take much time
2016-06-18 15:16:53	@Espyo	yeah, might work well with a video
2016-06-18 15:17:08	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z8fHcFRg not quite sure what to make of this one
2016-06-18 15:17:39	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-06-18 15:17:47	Marty2000	I'm not sure, but it might be in the Twilight River
2016-06-18 15:18:01	Marty2000	With the sequence break leading to the pink Onion
2016-06-18 15:18:54	@Espyo	hm, maybe
2016-06-18 15:20:21	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z7EcNisA I'm not seeing it
2016-06-18 15:22:24	Marty2000	Ok, recorded, it'll be here in more or less 30 minutes
2016-06-18 15:22:28	@Espyo	cool
2016-06-18 15:22:29	Marty2000	And it's not totally solid
2016-06-18 15:23:19	Marty2000	Yeah, I don't see the glitch either
2016-06-18 15:23:31	Marty2000	Look at who liked it :p
2016-06-18 15:23:33	Marty2000	TabuuandPeach
2016-06-18 15:23:43	@Espyo	huh? which one is he?
2016-06-18 15:24:12	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z7EcNisA That glitch, he's the guy in black
2016-06-18 15:24:37	@Espyo	*shiver*
2016-06-18 15:25:04	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 15:25:24	@Espyo	I also don't see anything here https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z7BeNofA
2016-06-18 15:25:25	Marty2000	We haven't seen him for a long time already
2016-06-18 15:25:33	@Espyo	yeah, thankfully
2016-06-18 15:25:41	Marty2000	Same
2016-06-18 15:25:47	Marty2000	And he liked that "glitch" too
2016-06-18 15:26:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-18 15:26:50	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z6vwxfgg going out of bounds?
2016-06-18 15:27:12	Marty2000	It's easy to go here
2016-06-18 15:27:16	Marty2000	But you can't go further
2016-06-18 15:27:32	Marty2000	You can't see the background around the arena thanks to that, though
2016-06-18 15:27:38	Marty2000	can see*
2016-06-18 15:27:41	@Espyo	ooh, neat
2016-06-18 15:27:44	@Espyo	probably worth adding, too
2016-06-18 15:27:55	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-18 15:28:00	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z7cmmBUA woah, this one's really something
2016-06-18 15:28:37	Marty2000	He pressed "b" and then, HOME during the transition
2016-06-18 15:28:44	Marty2000	(I suppose)
2016-06-18 15:30:30	@Espyo	I thought that too
2016-06-18 15:30:39	@Espyo	oh, wait
2016-06-18 15:30:43	@Espyo	at first, I thought it was that
2016-06-18 15:30:49	@Espyo	but then I had the idea that the two screens are completely different
2016-06-18 15:30:55	@Espyo	but no, one really is just the previous screen
2016-06-18 15:30:55	<--	Klemen702 (Mibbit@mgc-668-298-7.dynamic.siol.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-06-18 15:31:01	@Espyo	yeah, that's probably it
2016-06-18 15:31:02	@Espyo	pretty simple
2016-06-18 15:31:23	@Espyo	ok, this is the last one, and it's really confusing me
2016-06-18 15:31:38	@Espyo	on the Garden of Hope, on the bucket that serves as a pathway to the Quaggled Mireclops's arena
2016-06-18 15:31:40	@Espyo	there is a Pikmin drawing
2016-06-18 15:31:55	@Espyo	I can't remember, but I'm pretty sure it's outside of the water http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/a/ad/Garden_of_Hope_drawing_bud.jpg
2016-06-18 15:32:03	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z6lM92ow anyway, there's this post
2016-06-18 15:32:09	@Espyo	and... it looks like somewhere else entirely
2016-06-18 15:32:11	Marty2000	Be right back in a few minutes
2016-06-18 15:32:21	Marty2000	Ok, I'll check in a few minutes ;)
2016-06-18 15:32:34	@Espyo	I'll go check now, it's okay
2016-06-18 15:32:36	@Espyo	see you in a bit
2016-06-18 15:36:27	@Espyo	ok, it's exactly the same spot
2016-06-18 15:36:31	@Espyo	and it is underwater
2016-06-18 15:36:33	@Espyo	it's just hard to see
2016-06-18 15:37:16	Marty2000	Back
2016-06-18 15:37:23	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-18 15:37:40	En_Passant	I thought the Pikmin drawing was next to the Blue Onion
2016-06-18 15:38:13	Marty2000	Hmm, this spot is near the blue Onion, normally
2016-06-18 15:39:12	@Espyo	that's a different drawing
2016-06-18 15:39:42	Marty2000	(off-topic) https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z9GKjJUA Okay, Octolings are also becoming common :D
2016-06-18 15:40:04	@Espyo	heh, I bet
2016-06-18 15:40:10	@Espyo	why now, of all times?
2016-06-18 15:40:19	@Espyo	was there a recent breakthrough on how to hack the Wii U?
2016-06-18 15:40:24	@Espyo	I know there was a big one 2 months ago
2016-06-18 15:40:28	@Espyo	(or 1 month ago?)
2016-06-18 15:40:39	Marty2000	It's very easy, you don't need to hack your Wii U
2016-06-18 15:40:47	Marty2000	You need 10 minutes to play as an Octoling
2016-06-18 15:40:55	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-18 15:40:59	@Espyo	is there a tutorial around?
2016-06-18 15:41:08	Marty2000	I can tell you the tutorial
2016-06-18 15:41:42	@Espyo	I guess I'm more interested in knowing the ins and outs, and not so much how to do it
2016-06-18 15:41:52	@Espyo	so don't tire yourself out, if there's already a tutorial online somewhere
2016-06-18 15:41:59	Marty2000	I see, wait, I'll try to find
2016-06-18 15:42:06	Marty2000	(though, some are more complicated)
2016-06-18 15:42:08	@Espyo	all right
2016-06-18 15:42:35	Marty2000	https://gbatemp.net/threads/splatoon-modding-hub.425670/
2016-06-18 15:42:48	Marty2000	As an extra note, if you want to know your Wii U's Ip very quickly
2016-06-18 15:43:02	Marty2000	Go on the Internet Browser, enable developer tools,
2016-06-18 15:43:17	Marty2000	and it will show you something lke http://xxx.xxx.x.x:xxxx
2016-06-18 15:43:26	Marty2000	Just remember "xxx.xxx.x.x"
2016-06-18 15:43:45	Marty2000	Your Wii U IP is needed for the changes
2016-06-18 15:44:12	Marty2000	"These hacks were designed for Splatoon 2.7.0 and many of them will not work with 2.8.0." This is no longer true with certain hacks
2016-06-18 15:44:28	Marty2000	Also, if you wish to play as an Octoling online, be sure to take the safe version ;)
2016-06-18 15:45:08	Marty2000	The site for launching mods is "www.loadiine.ovh" (I think it's on the thread)
2016-06-18 15:49:50	@Espyo	right
2016-06-18 15:49:54	Marty2000	I bet BielR3 uses Loadiine too for launching his mods on P3
2016-06-18 15:50:18	Marty2000	Thanks to that, you can dump your games, and launch hacked games
2016-06-18 15:50:21	@Espyo	ugh, that thread is complicated
2016-06-18 15:50:24	@Espyo	there's no clear starting point
2016-06-18 15:50:29	Marty2000	Yeah, very
2016-06-18 15:50:44	Marty2000	Hmm, wait, now that I think of it...
2016-06-18 15:50:58	Marty2000	Check the logs, I explained PikFan how to do it tonight
2016-06-18 15:51:05	@Espyo	was I there?
2016-06-18 15:51:12	@Espyo	if not, I'll need the logs J is keeping
2016-06-18 15:51:18	Marty2000	No, you were already sleeping
2016-06-18 15:51:21	Marty2000	Yeah, they are updated
2016-06-18 15:51:29	Marty2000	up to date
2016-06-18 15:51:33	@Espyo	I don't know where those logs are though :P

2016-06-18 15:53:23	@Espyo	yeah, it's easy to pull off

2016-06-18 16:05:45	@Espyo	cool
2016-06-18 16:05:54	@Espyo	I tried it too, pretty much the same
2016-06-18 16:06:05	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-18 16:06:46	@Espyo	hm, so I can successfully run TCPGecko
2016-06-18 16:06:50	@Espyo	but the Splatoon program won't load for me
2016-06-18 16:06:55	@Espyo	since it's a Windows program and I'm on Linux
2016-06-18 16:06:59	@Espyo	I CAN run it under Wine
2016-06-18 16:07:01	@Espyo	but it's all glitchy
2016-06-18 16:07:06	@Espyo	and I'm pretty sure it's not doing anything
2016-06-18 16:07:10	@Espyo	plus, half of the buttons are all black
2016-06-18 16:07:14	@Espyo	so I'm afraid of clicking anything wrong
2016-06-18 16:07:17	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-18 16:07:42	Testyo	yes? I saw
2016-06-18 16:07:51	Marty2000	Well, if you ever need to modify, I could modify your equipment myself ;) I hope we can find some way to hack P3 with that
2016-06-18 16:08:24	@Espyo	yeah, let's hope
2016-06-18 16:08:30	@Espyo	but as for equipment, nah, I think I'm good, thanks
2016-06-18 16:08:37	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-18 16:09:10	@Espyo	so, what else can I do with loadiine?
2016-06-18 16:10:25	Marty2000	Normally, you can launch games if you have the files (I mean, n o CD required)
2016-06-18 16:10:29	Marty2000	I'm trying to find a tutorial
2016-06-18 16:11:22	Marty2000	Ah, by the way, once you launched TCP Gecko or Loadiine, don't go back to the Internet Browser (otherwise your Wii U crashes)
2016-06-18 16:11:36	Marty2000	(it's not a problem, but you need to restart the steps)
2016-06-18 16:12:01	Marty2000	https://gbatemp.net/threads/loadiine-gx2.413823/ Let's see...
2016-06-18 16:12:35	Marty2000	Check the "Installation" section
2016-06-18 16:12:51	@Espyo	yeah, I learned that the hard way :D
2016-06-18 16:13:25	@Espyo	hm, although this one does require installing things and whanot
2016-06-18 16:13:27	@Espyo	*whatnot
2016-06-18 16:13:32	@Espyo	I may one day dive into this

2016-06-18 16:13:35	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-06-18 16:13:52	Marty2000	Well, yeah, it's better not to install anything for now
2016-06-18 16:14:03	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-18 16:17:26	@Espyo	hm, I think Cemu got an update recently
2016-06-18 16:17:30	@Espyo	that runs Smash 4
2016-06-18 16:17:33	@Espyo	I can try Pikmin 3 on it again

2016-06-18 16:19:21	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-18 16:19:35	@Espyo	and it froze...
2016-06-18 16:19:38	@Espyo	still nothing

2016-06-18 16:27:43	@Espyo	the Pikmin that looked at Charlie had some black bars around them
2016-06-18 16:27:51	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 16:28:09	@Espyo	cool, runs at full speed for me

2016-06-18 16:28:40	@Espyo	not edited, simply Cemu
2016-06-18 16:29:02	@Espyo	it's working perfectly...

2016-06-18 16:31:20	@Espyo	woah
2016-06-18 16:31:30	@Espyo	the cutscene where Charlie gets surrounded by the VP was glitchy
2016-06-18 16:31:33	@Espyo	but all good so far
2016-06-18 16:31:36	@Espyo	I'll want to finish day 1
2016-06-18 16:31:42	@Espyo	otherwise I'll have to play the prologue every time I boot up the game...

2016-06-18 16:46:17	@Espyo	can't
2016-06-18 16:47:28	@Espyo	just noticed almost everything in the game is behind a .szs file
2016-06-18 16:47:35	@Espyo	unless I can find a .szs re-packer, this won't work

2016-06-18 16:49:21	@Espyo	like tell the game that the Red Bulborb is actually a Wollywog
2016-06-18 16:49:48	Yoshi2	Espyo: szs? Don't we already have a szs repacker
2016-06-18 16:49:57	@Espyo	the GameCube format, I'm afraid
2016-06-18 16:51:04	Yoshi2	in sunshine szs was just rarc or whatever
2016-06-18 16:51:25	@Espyo	hm, UWizard might work
2016-06-18 16:51:33	@Espyo	yeah, pretty much the same in P2, I think
2016-06-18 16:52:22	@Espyo	oooh, I think it can
2016-06-18 16:52:27	@Espyo	ok, CAREFULLY make a backup
2016-06-18 16:52:29	@Espyo	and I'll try it
2016-06-18 16:55:01	Yoshi2	even without UWizard there is a rarc repacker
2016-06-18 16:56:54	@Espyo	but will it work with the format the Wii U uses?
2016-06-18 16:57:10	@Espyo	hm, I tried packing, but UWizard just died
2016-06-18 16:57:12	@Espyo	not sure if it did it
2016-06-18 16:57:28	Marty2000	Yeah, you can with UWizard, normally
2016-06-18 16:58:11	@Espyo	ok, let's see if it DID change
2016-06-18 16:58:21	@Espyo	nope
2016-06-18 16:58:25	@Espyo	it crashed before even touching the file

2016-06-18 16:59:55	@Espyo	I'll try under windows

2016-06-18 17:08:36	@Espyo	turns out I can't replace the existing file?
2016-06-18 17:08:40	@Espyo	...fine, I'll create a new one

2016-06-18 17:10:29	Yoshi2	ok if the szs format on the wii u is different from the format on gamecube, then the rarc packer probably wouldn't work

2016-06-18 17:18:02	@Espyo	no, can't be
2016-06-18 17:18:07	Yoshi2	what
2016-06-18 17:18:12	@Espyo	well, I'm changing the name of the days on the save files

2016-06-18 17:18:26	@Espyo	and it's not going through
2016-06-18 17:18:36	@Espyo	the only reason I can think for this is that the string with the title is saved on the save file itself
2016-06-18 17:18:47	@Espyo	instead of, you know, saving the ID of the title, and then loading up the string with the ID
2016-06-18 17:18:53	@Espyo	ok, I'll try changing another string

2016-06-18 17:23:13	Marty2000	Oh, I didn't mean to start from scratch, just go trhough the loading screen and all instead of starting from a save state

2016-06-18 17:23:19	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-06-18 17:23:31	@Espyo	the Earth model on the TV screen on the day selection menu is higher quality than the one on the GamePad, where you see the log entry
2016-06-18 17:23:38	@Espyo	oh, that's what you meant
2016-06-18 17:23:43	@Espyo	that makes sense, but not in this case
2016-06-18 17:23:47	@Espyo	since there are no save states :P

2016-06-18 17:26:27	@Espyo	all right, you know what
2016-06-18 17:26:29	@Espyo	starting from scratch
2016-06-18 17:26:31	@Espyo	instead of editing strings
2016-06-18 17:26:33	@Espyo	I'll edit parameters
2016-06-18 17:26:41	@Espyo	time to make, I don't know, Red Bulborbs die to a single Rock Pikmin
2016-06-18 17:26:57	@Espyo	oh, but I shouldn't edit enemies
2016-06-18 17:27:03	@Espyo	since enemies can override those properties
2016-06-18 17:27:34	Marty2000	Hmm, can you add enemies or Pikmin in an existing level?
2016-06-18 17:27:38	Marty2000	to an*
2016-06-18 17:27:39	@Espyo	I think I can
2016-06-18 17:27:41	@Espyo	but it's too soon to say
2016-06-18 17:27:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-18 17:28:19	@Espyo	I really can't find anything that I can edit with ease
2016-06-18 17:28:59	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-18 17:29:08	@Espyo	I found the weather probability (?) files
2016-06-18 17:29:12	@Espyo	p20 Shine
2016-06-18 17:29:17	@Espyo	p90-98 Shine
2016-06-18 17:29:18	@Espyo	p99 Rain
2016-06-18 17:29:22	@Espyo	that... doesn't seem right
2016-06-18 17:29:29	@Espyo	is this saying that the Tropical Wilds has a 1 in 100 chance of raining?
2016-06-18 17:29:40	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-18 17:29:45	@Espyo	Garden of Hope has numbers above 100
2016-06-18 17:29:48	@Espyo	dunno what this means, then
2016-06-18 17:30:58	@Espyo	ok, I'll change a Blue Pikmin's throwing height
2016-06-18 17:31:02	@Espyo	if it works...
2016-06-18 17:31:03	@Espyo	see, that's the thing
2016-06-18 17:31:08	@Espyo	just because a file is here doesn't mean it's USED
2016-06-18 17:31:20	@Espyo	the values that control how high each Pikmin is thrown could as well be hardcoded inside the game's code
2016-06-18 17:31:26	@Espyo	and not in a file, ready for being edited
2016-06-18 17:31:32	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 17:37:52	@Espyo	that didn't seem to change anything
2016-06-18 17:37:59	@Espyo	...
2016-06-18 17:38:01	@Espyo	uhm
2016-06-18 17:38:04	Marty2000	So it could be hardocded...
2016-06-18 17:38:10	Marty2000	hardcoded
2016-06-18 17:38:11	@Espyo	I think I'm running the WUD file
2016-06-18 17:38:14	@Espyo	not the compressed file I made
2016-06-18 17:38:20	Marty2000	A
2016-06-18 17:38:22	Marty2000	Ah*
2016-06-18 17:38:27	@Espyo	sorry, I butchered taht
2016-06-18 17:38:27	@Espyo	*that
2016-06-18 17:38:35	@Espyo	I think I'm running the vanilla, unedited, intact, compressed, WUD file
2016-06-18 17:38:40	@Espyo	instead of the folder I extracted with the game's files
2016-06-18 17:39:05	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-06-18 17:39:15	@Espyo	I
2016-06-18 17:39:17	@Espyo	feel so stupid right now

2016-06-18 17:53:36	Marty2000	Nice!
2016-06-18 17:53:50	Marty2000	You can try so many things thanks to that, now...
2016-06-18 17:54:37	En_Passant	Time to make Pikmin 3: Up Late
2016-06-18 17:54:41	@Espyo	hehehe, yeah
2016-06-18 17:56:20	Marty2000	Hmm, can you even put, for example, Winged Pikmin in the Vehemith Phosbat mission?
2016-06-18 17:56:28	Marty2000	Vehemoth*
2016-06-18 17:56:47	@Espyo	pretty sure, yeah

2016-06-18 18:04:25	@Espyo	it's crashing now if I let it load the video for the Tropical Forest
2016-06-18 18:05:00	Marty2000	Oh
2016-06-18 18:05:07	@Espyo	only one thing to it then
2016-06-18 18:05:13	@Espyo	start the level before it loads!
2016-06-18 18:07:39	UltraMario	right now im trying to edit the smash css
2016-06-18 18:10:00	@Espyo	interesting...
2016-06-18 18:10:01	--	Chiaki_Prime is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-06-18 18:10:04	@Espyo	I tried adding the kakureimo
2016-06-18 18:10:07	@Espyo	it simply didn't load it
2016-06-18 18:10:14	@Espyo	didn't crash or anything, it just didn't load it
2016-06-18 18:11:26	Scruffy	Maybe it's just hiding :o
2016-06-18 18:11:33	@Espyo	doesn't show in the map :(
2016-06-18 18:13:03	@Espyo	now it's just crashing when I go to the level's data screen
2016-06-18 18:13:08	@Espyo	as if it's loading the video right away
2016-06-18 18:13:56	@Espyo	or maybe it's just unrelated to the video
2016-06-18 18:14:17	@Espyo	now it's just crashing at boot :|
2016-06-18 18:14:26	En_Passant	dun broke it
2016-06-18 18:14:29	Marty2000	Oh :(
2016-06-18 18:14:54	Scruffy	kakureimo has infected the whole system
2016-06-18 18:15:01	@Espyo	oh, booted now
2016-06-18 18:15:07	UltraMario	kek
2016-06-18 18:15:32	@Espyo	no, I can't enter the map
2016-06-18 18:15:37	@Espyo	it keeps crashing before I get the chance to
2016-06-18 18:16:41	UltraMario	rip
2016-06-18 18:17:01	@Espyo	wonder if other maps work...
2016-06-18 18:17:41	@Espyo	nope
2016-06-18 18:18:10	@Espyo	maybe I modified something that broke something without knowing?
2016-06-18 18:18:15	@Espyo	I'll try the vanilla game
2016-06-18 18:18:16	Marty2000	http://www.mediafire.com/download/yslc23a8x8odlfu/TCP+Gecko.NET.rar This has "Memory Viewer", "Debug" "Disassembler"... and I heard you could use this software to modify the game, but this is too complicated for me to use, there's HEX code
2016-06-18 18:18:39	@Espyo	ah, that
2016-06-18 18:18:42	@Espyo	yeah, that won't be easy to use
2016-06-18 18:20:48	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-18 18:20:54	@Espyo	looks like I can buy myself time if I disable vertex cache
2016-06-18 18:21:04	@Espyo	I'm confident that this happens because it's loading the stage preview video
2016-06-18 18:22:51	@Espyo	yes, looks like that works!
2016-06-18 18:22:55	@Espyo	makes the game run a touch slower though :/
2016-06-18 18:25:07	@Espyo	ok, dumb strategy
2016-06-18 18:25:09	@Espyo	run the game like normal
2016-06-18 18:25:16	@Espyo	when it's time to show the stage data screen
2016-06-18 18:25:19	@Espyo	I switch vertex cache off
2016-06-18 18:25:25	@Espyo	and mash the A button to get in before it loads the video
2016-06-18 18:25:39	@Espyo	ok, definitely no kakureimo
2016-06-18 18:25:46	@Espyo	if I try to spawn it, the game just ignores it
2016-06-18 18:26:19	Scruffy	How about other enemies?
2016-06-18 18:26:26	Scruffy	Even ones that are already in the game
2016-06-18 18:27:00	@Espyo	ok, I'll try imomushi
2016-06-18 18:27:05	@Espyo	oops, buriko
2016-06-18 18:27:18	@Espyo	yeah, I guess I should try an existing enemy before diving right in
2016-06-18 18:27:26	@Espyo	didn't load buriko either
2016-06-18 18:28:06	@Espyo	wait...
2016-06-18 18:28:12	@Espyo	maybe it's expecting Kakureimo, and I wrote kakureimo
2016-06-18 18:28:30	@Espyo	also, I can just choose Retry and it'll load again, instead of closing down and restarting the emulator!
2016-06-18 18:29:11	Scruffy	Finally!
2016-06-18 18:29:19	Scruffy	How I wish that were the case in P2
2016-06-18 18:29:24	@Espyo	tell me about it
2016-06-18 18:29:46	@Espyo	IT WORKED!!
2016-06-18 18:29:57	Marty2000	Great

2016-06-18 18:31:58	Marty2000	Oh, nice
2016-06-18 18:32:11	Marty2000	That enemy is fun, even though it's unfinished
2016-06-18 18:32:17	@Espyo	it's so weird to attack him
2016-06-18 18:35:57	@Espyo	a) you can just restart the level to see the changes
2016-06-18 18:36:15	@Espyo	b) if the name of the enemy you entered is wrong, it doesn't crash, it just fails to load it
2016-06-18 18:36:18	@Espyo	thank you based Nintendo

2016-06-18 19:12:39	@Espyo	it'll likely crash
2016-06-18 19:12:48	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 19:13:11	Marty2000	Can't you replace plant or put some?
2016-06-18 19:13:18	Scruffy	But perhaps you could spawn a clover patch in the Quaggled Mireclops arena?

2016-06-18 19:45:00	@Espyo	the Scornets just dart at you and then take a turn upwards

2016-06-18 19:54:19	@Espyo	I tried getting a translation, but got nothing
2016-06-18 19:54:24	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Vegetation#Epipremnum_aureum
2016-06-18 19:54:30	Marty2000	I'll see
2016-06-18 19:55:00	@Espyo	not sure if that's the one
2016-06-18 19:55:03	@Espyo	also, we're hiding now
2016-06-18 19:55:13	@Espyo	they formed...
2016-06-18 19:55:24	@Espyo	and missed us... but it's because we're near the wall, I bet
2016-06-18 19:55:36	Marty2000	Hmm
2016-06-18 19:55:45	Marty2000	I should tell you something about hiding, by the way
2016-06-18 19:55:47	@Espyo	maybe Cemu is glitching, and they can't get us at all
2016-06-18 19:55:49	@Espyo	hmm?
2016-06-18 19:56:14	Marty2000	You are invincible (except against the snowballs from Artic Cannon Larvae)
2016-06-18 19:56:27	@Espyo	oh, is that so?
2016-06-18 19:56:30	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-18 19:56:35	@Espyo	also, it CAN get me
2016-06-18 19:56:44	Marty2000	Well, at least for Bulborbs...
2016-06-18 19:57:04	@Espyo	should be simple to test with a Skutterchuck, for instance
2016-06-18 19:57:51	Marty2000	Well, if it can see you, you won't be able to try...
2016-06-18 19:57:55	Marty2000	can't*
2016-06-18 19:58:02	@Espyo	lure its shot first, hide later
2016-06-18 19:58:42	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-18 20:03:48	@Espyo	wow, looks like you are
2016-06-18 20:04:00	@Espyo	I placed a clover in the center of the arena
2016-06-18 20:04:06	@Espyo	instead of near the edges, where the mushrooms were
2016-06-18 20:04:19	@Espyo	if it's near the edges, the Scornets just fly up
2016-06-18 20:04:20	@Espyo	it's dumb
2016-06-18 20:04:28	@Espyo	it's also happening to me on the real Wii U, so it's not an emulation problem
2016-06-18 20:04:33	@Espyo	anyway, they dived at my group
2016-06-18 20:04:36	@Espyo	and not a single one of them got hit
2016-06-18 20:04:43	@Espyo	so they're not ignored, but they are invincible
2016-06-18 20:05:10	@Espyo	wait, maybe not
2016-06-18 20:05:14	@Espyo	looks like I had some idle Pikmin

2016-06-18 20:06:20	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-18 20:07:10	Marty2000	Well, yeah, I'm pretty sure Pikmin are invincible (but against snowballs)
2016-06-18 20:08:11	@Espyo	so, you're saying they can still get taken away by snowballs?
2016-06-18 20:08:15	@Espyo	Yoshi2: sure, help's always good
2016-06-18 20:09:11	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 20:09:22	Marty2000	You can try on Silver Lake (BE!)
2016-06-18 20:09:58	Marty2000	Well, hmm, they can't see you when you're hiding, so you need to make it so that the snowball will touch the hiding spot
2016-06-18 20:11:41	Yoshi2	I'm a little bit annoyed how all the German words, despite having different word families, eventually just gravitate towards the same meaning as the others
2016-06-18 20:12:28	@Espyo	right
2016-06-18 20:12:41	@Espyo	heh, how so, Yoshi2?
2016-06-18 20:13:03	Marty2000	Yoshi2: if you like German translations, I have to add even more names (fruits ) ;)
2016-06-18 20:13:24	Yoshi2	for example, the Shock Absorber

2016-06-18 20:15:52	Marty2000	Because the ship parts can have different names in-game

2016-06-18 20:48:18	Yoshi2	i know no spanish but plugging that into google translate gives me Ion Reactor or Ionic Reactor
2016-06-18 20:49:23	Marty2000	Hmm... to me, "Jet" fits better here

2016-06-18 20:54:09	Yoshi2	I'm also a bit bothered by the use of Ionium
2016-06-18 20:54:52	Yoshi2	in a lot of the places you put Ionium, seems like Ionic would fit
2016-06-18 20:54:53	Marty2000	"On June 14th, 2002, Pikmin on the GameCube was released in Europe and Australia!" Happy birthday... quite late :p
2016-06-18 20:55:11	Marty2000	Well, Ionic could be better, indeed
2016-06-18 20:55:18	Marty2000	I don't know for Reactor, though
2016-06-18 20:56:29	Yoshi2	I'll put ionic instead of ionium and if your family responds about reactor I will change that too
2016-06-18 20:56:37	Yoshi2	or not change it
2016-06-18 20:56:42	Yoshi2	depending on what they think
2016-06-18 20:58:06	Yoshi2	also, you put Number 1 at the start for the translations of words that had it at the end
2016-06-18 20:58:22	Yoshi2	if you have no objections, I'd put that at the front
2016-06-18 20:58:32	Marty2000	Yoshi2: Ionic Reator fits the best. Jet is not wrong, but is only used in certain cases (here, it wouldn't fit as well as Reactor)
2016-06-18 20:58:35	Marty2000	So you can change
2016-06-18 20:58:38	Marty2000	Hmm, let me see...
2016-06-18 20:58:56	Marty2000	Well, here, that's normal, the order is different in French
2016-06-18 20:59:35	Marty2000	Hmm, I think "Propeller Ionium Number 1" wouldn't sound good in English, so I thought it was best to put "Number 1 Ionium Propeller"
2016-06-18 21:01:13	Yoshi2	meh, I reverted it to the original order
2016-06-18 21:01:41	Yoshi2	"Jet ionio 1" is weird, I see no translations for ionio in italian
2016-06-18 21:02:20	Marty2000	But that's the name given in-gale

2016-06-18 22:12:37	Marty2000	Night Owl for me ;) (I cannot participate, but well)

2016-06-18 22:59:17	Scruffy	Hi everybody!
2016-06-18 22:59:26	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-06-18 22:59:45	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-18 22:59:57	@PikFan	how goes the Pikmin Color Splash project?
2016-06-18 23:00:55	Scruffy	I've got animations down to actions; now I can just stamp down a Jump or a Throw anywhere and Olimar will do it
2016-06-18 23:07:58	@PikFan	Espyo
2016-06-18 23:08:04	@PikFan	I'm an Octoling!
2016-06-18 23:08:08	@Espyo	hehe, you did it
2016-06-18 23:08:56	Marty2000	You will have to click on the .bat and laucnh loadiine.ovh twice each time you wanna play as an Octoling though. But yeah, that's fun
2016-06-18 23:09:17	Marty2000	It does not work on boy Inklings (but the squid that is changed into an octopus)
2016-06-18 23:09:34	@PikFan	I see so many Octolings now
2016-06-18 23:09:36	Marty2000	So if you had a boy Inkling, you need to be a female inkling
2016-06-18 23:09:39	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 23:10:28	@PikFan	I'm going to an Octoling mission
2016-06-18 23:10:36	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 23:10:39	@PikFan	"Octoling" vs Octolings
2016-06-18 23:10:44	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 23:10:50	Marty2000	I should try too
2016-06-18 23:12:53	Marty2000	You may have noticed two things, though
2016-06-18 23:13:01	Marty2000	1. You have the female Inkling voice
2016-06-18 23:13:04	@PikFan	yes
2016-06-18 23:13:09	@PikFan	and the ghost is the Inkling ghost
2016-06-18 23:13:15	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-18 23:13:51	Marty2000	3. Some hats are glitchy (they are inside the head of your Octoling)
2016-06-18 23:15:43	@PikFan	yup
2016-06-18 23:16:00	@PikFan	so, if I did the dangerous one instead...
2016-06-18 23:16:12	@PikFan	would the ghost become the Octoling ghost?
2016-06-18 23:16:17	Marty2000	I think so
2016-06-18 23:16:24	Marty2000	But really, I don't recommend it:
2016-06-18 23:16:30	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-18 23:16:38	Marty2000	1. You brick others' saves, and you have to edit hex code
2016-06-18 23:17:15	Marty2000	2. There's not two
2016-06-18 23:17:22	Marty2000	(that was really stupid ... )
2016-06-18 23:17:28	Marty2000	There's no*
2016-06-18 23:17:43	@PikFan	there's no two what?
2016-06-18 23:18:02	@PikFan	...oh
2016-06-18 23:18:04	@PikFan	I get it :P
2016-06-18 23:18:12	Marty2000	I wrote 1. ... because I thought I would write a second thing
2016-06-18 23:18:20	Marty2000	But actually, I don't know what to write :p
2016-06-18 23:18:24	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-18 23:18:54	@PikFan	I thought it was safe if you did it in private battles, since the octoling model won't be loaded in others' plazas
2016-06-18 23:19:05	Marty2000	No, it still loads
2016-06-18 23:19:11	@PikFan	really?
2016-06-18 23:19:21	Marty2000	If others don't want to risk their saves, they need to hack the dangerous Octoling too
2016-06-18 23:19:28	Marty2000	Yeah, I read some threads about that
2016-06-18 23:19:38	@PikFan	I thought Inklings were loaded only from Regular and Ranked battles
2016-06-18 23:19:42	@PikFan	not Private battles
2016-06-18 23:20:09	@PikFan	hm, interesting
2016-06-18 23:20:10	Marty2000	I do think they load, but well, if they don't, Nintendo can still ban you
2016-06-18 23:20:16	@PikFan	he
2016-06-18 23:20:17	@PikFan	h
2016-06-18 23:20:20	Marty2000	With the normal Octoling, there's no risk, you just swap a model
2016-06-18 23:20:28	Marty2000	With the dangerous one, that's different
2016-06-18 23:20:29	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-18 23:21:57	@PikFan	so it's totally safe for me to play online with the safe one?
2016-06-18 23:22:08	Marty2000	Oh, by the way, when you're playing using Loadiine, don't launch another application (such as Miiverse) or your Wii U. Otherwise, it'll crash
2016-06-18 23:22:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-18 23:22:25	Marty2000	No, don't worry. I played some matches this afternoon. And it's the safest hack
2016-06-18 23:22:37	Marty2000	The model swap is just for your console
2016-06-18 23:23:02	Marty2000	"Rating 1: This is simply a model swap, so there is a 0% chance of getting banned!" https://gbatemp.net/threads/splatoon-modding-hub.425670/
2016-06-18 23:23:03	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-18 23:24:11	Marty2000	If you don't want to get banned, just don't do that (he got banned) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIGPPqueR7o
2016-06-18 23:24:14	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 23:24:29	Marty2000	Infinite range for his weapobn
2016-06-18 23:24:31	Marty2000	weapon*
2016-06-18 23:24:35	Marty2000	and infinite ink dispersion
2016-06-18 23:26:00	@PikFan	seems like he can run a lot faster too
2016-06-18 23:26:07	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 23:27:00	@PikFan	how is the Kraken able to splat them from so far away
2016-06-18 23:27:08	<--	Scruffy (Mibbit@179-777-1-60.lightspeed.chtnsc.sbcglobal.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-06-18 23:27:27	Marty2000	He must have modified the collision radius or something like that
2016-06-18 23:29:01	@PikFan	what
2016-06-18 23:29:10	@PikFan	how'd they get splatted inside the shield
2016-06-18 23:29:14	@PikFan	*spawn shield
2016-06-18 23:29:24	Marty2000	Hmm, I don't know for that one, though...
2016-06-18 23:29:54	@PikFan	that is the stuff of nightmares right there
2016-06-18 23:30:39	Marty2000	Maybe the shield around the spawn point reflects attacks but does not make your Inkling invincible
2016-06-18 23:31:28	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-18 23:31:44	@PikFan	it seems like that guy also can paint everything instantly
2016-06-18 23:32:40	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-18 23:34:18	@PikFan	maybe I'm really unlucky (or rather, lucky) because I've never encountered a hacker
2016-06-18 23:34:22	@PikFan	have you?
2016-06-18 23:34:34	Marty2000	Never
2016-06-18 23:34:48	@PikFan	how is it that this guy did
2016-06-18 23:34:52	Marty2000	Too bad they get banned, it's cool to met some every so often
2016-06-18 23:35:40	Marty2000	He edited the game using TcpGecko (it's a program that lets you see the game currently launched on your Wii U and edit it)
2016-06-18 23:36:00	Marty2000	You can edit any game, I think, but you have to edit hex code, and it's too complicated for me
2016-06-18 23:36:20	Marty2000	Plus, you will easily get banned if you try weird things online
2016-06-18 23:36:33	Marty2000	But this is also the tool that allows you to launch codes
2016-06-18 23:36:46	Marty2000	(for example, moon jump in Mario Kart)
2016-06-18 23:37:26	@PikFan	but if you hack games like Pikmin 3, it's harder for them to find out you hacked it, right?
2016-06-18 23:37:36	@PikFan	and thus your chance of getting banned is lower?
2016-06-18 23:37:50	Marty2000	Oh, if you hack for solo, then , no problem
2016-06-18 23:38:00	Marty2000	As long as you don't take pics and share them on Miiverse
2016-06-18 23:38:08	@PikFan	right :P
2016-06-18 23:38:17	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-06-18 23:38:18	Marty2000	Well, I don't even know for Miiverse
2016-06-18 23:38:23	Marty2000	Some hours ago,
2016-06-18 23:38:35	Marty2000	I posted some screenshots for Espyo to see
2016-06-18 23:38:37	@PikFan	what if you created your own server that you could play Splatoon on
2016-06-18 23:38:47	Marty2000	There was an Octoling in the Miiverse community
2016-06-18 23:38:54	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-06-18 23:38:55	Marty2000	And also hacks for Super Smash 4
2016-06-18 23:39:07	Marty2000	I don't know if their post was deleted
2016-06-18 23:39:53	Marty2000	You mean, a non-official server like the one in Mario Kart Wii where you can still play today?
2016-06-18 23:40:13	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-18 23:40:20	Marty2000	It should be fine, then
2016-06-18 23:40:24	@PikFan	a server independent from Nintendo's
2016-06-18 23:40:39	@PikFan	I bet that's a lot harder than just hacking the game :P
2016-06-18 23:40:44	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 23:41:02	@PikFan	but if you created your own server for you and your friends to play on
2016-06-18 23:41:06	@PikFan	AND hacked the game...
2016-06-18 23:41:10	@PikFan	oh man, that would be so fun
2016-06-18 23:41:21	@PikFan	and you wouldn't get in trouble for it
2016-06-18 23:41:22	Marty2000	Someone will probably do it in the future
2016-06-18 23:41:26	@PikFan	not immediately, anyway
2016-06-18 23:41:28	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-18 23:42:48	Marty2000	Well then, I"ll join a regular battle, feel free to join me if you want to
2016-06-18 23:49:38	@PikFan	okay
2016-06-18 23:49:47	@PikFan	was watching a hacked Inkling fly :P
2016-06-18 23:49:52	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-18 23:51:56	Marty2000	That is a horrible room, but still fun, lol.
2016-06-18 23:52:13	@PikFan	horrible how?
2016-06-18 23:52:38	@PikFan	also, I have the Splattershot Jr equipped
2016-06-18 23:52:41	Marty2000	You have beginners and S+99, something like that
2016-06-18 23:53:05	Marty2000	I mean, the other team camped around our spawn point twice
2016-06-18 23:53:12	@PikFan	._.
2016-06-18 23:53:23	@PikFan	but...but you're a S+99!
2016-06-18 23:56:38	@PikFan	that Quak person kept killing me
2016-06-18 23:56:38	Marty2000	It doesn't mean I can't handle four players at once :p
2016-06-18 23:56:46	Marty2000	And some people squidbagged me
2016-06-18 23:56:55	Marty2000	(which I did too afterwards)
2016-06-18 23:56:57	@PikFan	also, I remembered I had the Octoshot Replica equipped, since I'm an Octoling :P
2016-06-18 23:57:10	Marty2000	Lol
2016-06-18 23:57:17	Marty2000	There's a person with "Bat"
2016-06-18 23:57:24	@PikFan	mhm?
2016-06-18 23:57:26	Marty2000	Reminds me the struggle of that .bat file
2016-06-18 23:57:33	@PikFan	haha
2016-06-19 00:00:12	@PikFan	lol, we traded
2016-06-19 00:00:18	Marty2000	We have the same equipment
2016-06-19 00:00:19	Marty2000	Nearly
2016-06-19 00:00:22	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-19 00:01:29	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-19 00:01:38	@PikFan	this is insane
2016-06-19 00:01:39	Marty2000	I might take the Octobrush, later
2016-06-19 00:01:47	Marty2000	So I will be a true Octoling :D
2016-06-19 00:01:56	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-19 00:02:18	@PikFan	someone has 12 damage ups
2016-06-19 00:02:24	Marty2000	Really?
2016-06-19 00:02:35	@PikFan	it was a blaster on your team
2016-06-19 00:02:38	Marty2000	Then, either he got them with chance...
2016-06-19 00:02:47	@PikFan	or he hacked ;)
2016-06-19 00:02:52	Marty2000	either he used a method that you know :)
2016-06-19 00:02:56	Marty2000	or*
2016-06-19 00:03:15	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-19 00:04:27	Marty2000	Heh... what bizarre nicknames, hah
2016-06-19 00:05:33	@PikFan	that Safari guy...
2016-06-19 00:06:35	Marty2000	Yeah...
2016-06-19 00:06:47	Marty2000	12 Quick Respawns
2016-06-19 00:06:54	@PikFan	11
2016-06-19 00:07:07	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-19 00:07:30	@PikFan	I think he's a hacker
2016-06-19 00:07:42	@PikFan	he keeps one-shotting me
2016-06-19 00:07:53	@PikFan	can we leave this room?
2016-06-19 00:08:00	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-19 00:08:00	@PikFan	OH WOW WE WON
2016-06-19 00:08:06	Marty2000	I'll take the Octobrush too
2016-06-19 00:08:10	Marty2000	Yay!
2016-06-19 00:08:14	Marty2000	That was close, though
2016-06-19 00:08:38	Marty2000	I'll join you
2016-06-19 00:08:42	@PikFan	heh, okay
2016-06-19 00:10:26	Marty2000	I was modifying my equipment

2016-06-19 00:12:06	@PikFan	I restarted my Wii U

2016-06-19 00:12:10	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-19 00:12:34	Marty2000	Well, I'll join a room

2016-06-19 00:19:12	@PikFan	joining
2016-06-19 00:21:31	Marty2000	Some people were trying to squid party
2016-06-19 00:21:40	@PikFan	hehe
2016-06-19 00:21:43	Marty2000	I got eventually killed by the last person in the squid party
2016-06-19 00:21:50	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-19 00:22:00	Marty2000	And... everybody left :p

2016-06-19 00:37:58	@PikFan	why are most Splatoon players Japanese
2016-06-19 00:38:03	@PikFan	I don't understand this
2016-06-19 00:38:19	@PikFan	when Japan's in a Splatfest, there's barely anyone to play with
2016-06-19 00:38:29	@PikFan	but /why/
2016-06-19 00:39:52	Marty2000	The majority of Splatoon's players are Japanese, I think
2016-06-19 00:40:04	Marty2000	Wait, I didn't read everything
2016-06-19 00:40:10	Marty2000	"why are most Splatoon players Japanese" :p
2016-06-19 00:40:13	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-06-19 00:40:31	Marty2000	Hmm, the game was made in Japan
2016-06-19 00:40:46	Marty2000	That's my only explanation :)
2016-06-19 00:40:49	@PikFan	and I disconnected again
2016-06-19 00:40:57	Marty2000	Oh...
2016-06-19 00:42:01	@PikFan	what say you, Espyo?
2016-06-19 00:42:13	@Espyo	hmm?
2016-06-19 00:42:17	@Espyo	TL;DR of what's happening?
2016-06-19 00:42:36	@PikFan	why do I lag so bad when Japan's in a Splatfest?

2016-06-19 00:45:34	@Espyo	I lag so bad when Japan is anywhere
2016-06-19 00:46:14	@PikFan	hmm
2016-06-19 00:46:23	@PikFan	well, I just finished a match
2016-06-19 00:46:32	@PikFan	didn't disconnect, but I had horrible lag throughout
2016-06-19 00:46:40	@PikFan	people were teleporting all over the place
2016-06-19 00:47:00	@PikFan	people dying later than they should...
2016-06-19 00:47:02	@PikFan	it was a mess
2016-06-19 00:47:15	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-19 00:47:18	@PikFan	but I didn't disconnect
2016-06-19 00:47:20	@PikFan	somehow
2016-06-19 00:49:29	Marty2000	Yeah, lag
2016-06-19 00:49:32	Marty2000	I couldn't react
2016-06-19 00:50:36	@PikFan	that was awful
2016-06-19 00:50:39	@PikFan	but also hilarious
2016-06-19 00:50:47	@PikFan	Marty, you gotta record this lagfest
2016-06-19 00:50:50	Marty2000	Yeah, great match regardless of the laag
2016-06-19 00:50:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-19 00:51:17	Marty2000	I'm recording :)

2016-06-19 01:04:06	Marty2000	I could super-jump to you the moment you disconnected
2016-06-19 01:10:17	@PikFan	oh, the Japanese Splatfest ended
2016-06-19 01:13:05	Marty2000	Ah

2016-06-19 01:37:36	Marty2000	"I'm a Tidy King! Don't MESS with team tidy, team Messy." Hmm...

2016-06-19 02:15:04	@PikFan	I have the golden watering can, though...
2016-06-19 02:15:21	@PikFan	I just have to make a black rose and let it wilt, right?
2016-06-19 02:15:27	Marty2000	You need a wilting black rose
2016-06-19 02:15:31	Marty2000	Yes

2016-06-19 02:17:02	Marty2000	I did so too, I think
2016-06-19 02:17:11	Marty2000	But I can't anymore because I have a New3DS :/

2016-06-19 02:17:36	@PikFan	why did Nintendo get rid of that internet switch?
2016-06-19 02:17:45	@PikFan	heck, why was it on the original 3DS?

2016-06-19 02:38:46	@PikFan	well, I mean I was in 10th grade
2016-06-19 02:38:52	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-19 02:38:55	Marty2000	I was in Seconde
2016-06-19 02:38:56	@PikFan	but 10th grade ≠ 10th year of school

2016-06-19 02:39:27	@PikFan	for me, it's more like my 13th year of school
2016-06-19 02:39:35	@PikFan	I had two years of preschool
2016-06-19 02:39:39	@PikFan	then kindergarten

2016-06-19 02:41:18	Marty2000	Or at least, I won't be able to make changes
2016-06-19 02:41:24	Marty2000	Just connect to the chatroom
2016-06-19 02:41:34	Marty2000	I think it shouldn't be for long, but I can't know
2016-06-19 02:42:25	@PikFan	huh, why?
2016-06-19 02:42:48	Marty2000	Well, I won't be at home... but I think I'll be back soon
2016-06-19 02:42:59	@PikFan	hm, I see
2016-06-19 02:43:29	Marty2000	I mean, I won't be able to play on Wii U or such things, so... I can't do science for P3 :p
2016-06-19 02:43:35	Marty2000	(and other Pikmin)
2016-06-19 02:43:55	@PikFan	how come you're leaving home?
2016-06-19 02:44:09	Marty2000	Hmm, I can see the chatroom is pretty quiet when we Europeans are not connected :p
2016-06-19 02:44:43	Marty2000	Ah, well, that's complicated, I have to go to hospital for some time, I have health problems... but that shoudln't be long, hopefully
2016-06-19 02:44:50	Marty2000	shouldn't*
2016-06-19 02:47:07	@PikFan	oh...
2016-06-19 02:47:29	@PikFan	well, I hope you get those issues fixed
2016-06-19 02:47:59	Marty2000	Thanks. It should be for 2 weeks, I think
2016-06-19 02:49:06	Marty2000	Then, maybe I'll spend the rest of my holiday with my grandparents. What will you do during your vacation?
2016-06-19 02:49:22	Marty2000	(if you don't mind telling, of course)
2016-06-19 02:52:06	@PikFan	well, I'll be out of town for a week to celebrate the 4th of July
2016-06-19 02:52:19	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-19 02:52:25	@PikFan	I might have internet access, might not
2016-06-19 02:52:36	@PikFan	I'll bring my Wii U with me, though
2016-06-19 02:52:51	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-19 02:52:53	@PikFan	also might go to the coast and go to other fun places
2016-06-19 02:52:59	@PikFan	other than that... not much, really
2016-06-19 02:54:57	Marty2000	I see, looks fun
2016-06-19 02:55:22	Marty2000	I migt spend my time playing video-games too :p
2016-06-19 02:55:25	Marty2000	might*
2016-06-19 02:55:42	@PikFan	heheheh
2016-06-19 03:00:18	Marty2000	Hmm, do you have Splatoon amiibos?
2016-06-19 03:00:22	@PikFan	nope
2016-06-19 03:00:35	@PikFan	do you?
2016-06-19 03:00:45	Marty2000	Looks like there's a hack that allows you to unlock their mini-games
2016-06-19 03:00:48	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-19 03:01:19	@PikFan	oooh
2016-06-19 03:01:24	Marty2000	I'll try to get more information on the hack and try to get it work (with another account)
2016-06-19 03:01:31	Marty2000	If it works, I'll give you the files ;)
2016-06-19 03:01:41	@PikFan	how do you discover these hacks?
2016-06-19 03:01:50	Marty2000	Surfing on the Internet
2016-06-19 03:01:59	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-06-19 03:02:28	@PikFan	well, Lagfest seems to have ended
2016-06-19 03:02:31	@PikFan	thankfully
2016-06-19 03:02:32	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-19 03:03:46	Marty2000	Seems the hack is as easy as the Octoling, let's see...
2016-06-19 03:04:32	Marty2000	If it works, I'll modify the files for you, you won't have much to do
2016-06-19 03:05:32	Marty2000	"UltraMario is online"
2016-06-19 03:05:41	UltraMario	ohi
2016-06-19 03:05:43	Marty2000	Can't you show a better message when I turn you on, Wii U?
2016-06-19 03:05:43	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-19 03:05:46	Marty2000	I'm joking ;)
2016-06-19 03:05:47	UltraMario	EY
2016-06-19 03:05:51	UltraMario	*HEY|
2016-06-19 03:05:52	UltraMario	:P
2016-06-19 03:05:56	UltraMario	im testing out more mods
2016-06-19 03:05:58	UltraMario	:o
2016-06-19 03:06:00	Marty2000	Great
2016-06-19 03:06:10	Marty2000	Everybody is hacking here
2016-06-19 03:06:14	UltraMario	yeeee
2016-06-19 03:06:23	Marty2000	Hack is great, hack is life :D
2016-06-19 03:06:23	@PikFan	we're all gonna get banned
2016-06-19 03:06:24	@PikFan	;)
2016-06-19 03:06:32	@PikFan	*love
2016-06-19 03:06:34	Marty2000	Yeah, PikFan, but that's for the better 
2016-06-19 03:06:34	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-19 03:06:50	@PikFan	wanna join me in Splatoon?
2016-06-19 03:06:55	@PikFan	I'm just trying to level some gear
2016-06-19 03:07:01	Marty2000	Yeah, just wait a few minutes
2016-06-19 03:07:30	Marty2000	Why don't you directly level them up with SPlatHax? Unless you are a honest player, in which case you have my respect :)
2016-06-19 03:07:41	Marty2000	Well, you would have it if you had hacked too, heh :p
2016-06-19 03:08:34	@PikFan	oh, I can?
2016-06-19 03:08:52	@PikFan	it didn't show any of my gear that still had ? in them
2016-06-19 03:09:05	Marty2000	The hack for the mini-games worked!
2016-06-19 03:09:19	@PikFan	wow, that was fast
2016-06-19 03:09:32	Marty2000	There's something like "Level Up" and another option to "unlock", I think
2016-06-19 03:09:47	Marty2000	Okay, I'll modify the files for you and I'll upload them
2016-06-19 03:09:56	Marty2000	That will be easy this time, no worries :p
2016-06-19 03:10:36	@PikFan	by mini-games, do you mean like Squid Jump?
2016-06-19 03:10:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-19 03:10:45	Marty2000	And the jukebox too
2016-06-19 03:10:50	Marty2000	Well, everything ;)
2016-06-19 03:11:06	@PikFan	neat

2016-06-19 03:11:24	Marty2000	http://www.filedropper.com/allminigames_1
2016-06-19 03:11:36	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-19 03:11:37	Marty2000	Download them and put them in the same folder as the files for the Octoling
2016-06-19 03:11:41	@PikFan	I'll do those tomorrow
2016-06-19 03:11:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-19 03:11:53	@PikFan	for now, I'm gonna edit more gear
2016-06-19 03:13:00	Marty2000	Oh, you can even play with the amiibos even if you don't have them (you can make them appear in the amiibo box on the plaza) :p
2016-06-19 03:13:06	Marty2000	That's great :D
2016-06-19 03:14:23	@PikFan	odd, I can't connect, even though I went to loadiine.ovh twice
2016-06-19 03:14:53	Marty2000	Did you restart your Wii U beforehand?
2016-06-19 03:14:59	@PikFan	...no
2016-06-19 03:15:08	Marty2000	Might be the problem, heh
2016-06-19 03:15:22	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-06-19 03:28:21	Marty2000	Hmm, I guess you already have all the weapons in Splatoon too, but there's a hack that allows you to unlock them all
2016-06-19 03:28:33	Marty2000	Wonder what would happen if I did so as a level 1
2016-06-19 03:28:39	@PikFan	I don't have the amiibo weapons
2016-06-19 03:28:46	Marty2000	Oh, yeah
2016-06-19 03:29:05	Marty2000	You can unlock them with the amiibo thing that I told you
2016-06-19 03:29:13	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-19 03:29:21	Marty2000	(you can play the amiibo missions)
2016-06-19 03:29:43	Marty2000	I think it's better because the hack fr unlocking all weapons may reset your "Turf points"
2016-06-19 03:29:49	Marty2000	for*
2016-06-19 03:31:19	@PikFan	trying out some hacked gear :D
2016-06-19 03:31:25	Marty2000	Cool
2016-06-19 03:31:37	Marty2000	What did you hack this time?
2016-06-19 03:32:46	@PikFan	quick respawns
2016-06-19 03:32:48	@PikFan	quick super jumps
2016-06-19 03:32:53	@PikFan	and special charge ups
2016-06-19 03:32:56	Marty2000	Oh, I have them too
2016-06-19 03:33:11	Marty2000	Can I join you? I want to cause some terror on Turf War
2016-06-19 03:33:14	Marty2000	If not, it's fine :p
2016-06-19 03:33:27	@PikFan	I'll probably change them after this match
2016-06-19 03:33:32	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-19 03:33:59	Marty2000	I'll take Super Jumps
2016-06-19 03:36:52	@PikFan	12 Special Charge Ups w/ Wasabi Splattershot
2016-06-19 03:37:01	@PikFan	I wanna see how fast I can charge an Inkstrike
2016-06-19 03:37:06	Marty2000	NIce, I'll take them with my Splatteshot Jr :p
2016-06-19 03:40:22	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-19 03:40:48	Marty2000	Did it go well?
2016-06-19 03:40:51	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-19 03:41:17	@PikFan	eeh...
2016-06-19 03:41:26	@PikFan	Resort isn't a very good map
2016-06-19 03:41:31	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-19 03:42:55	Marty2000	7.8/10 too much water
2016-06-19 03:45:07	Marty2000	Don't you agree, UltraMario? ;)
2016-06-19 03:45:47	UltraMario	heh

2016-06-19 12:56:46	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-06-19 12:56:46	Testyo	Hello! I was dropping by to see if any of you guys have been able to find the pikmin short films that Shigeru Miyamoto made ANY mistake so far?
2016-06-19 12:57:08	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-19 12:59:21	Marty2000	Hmm, I wondered if there was a mistake here: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Talk:Proton_AA
2016-06-19 12:59:23	Marty2000	"Hococtae"
2016-06-19 12:59:28	Marty2000	Hococtate*
2016-06-19 12:59:34	Marty2000	(I'm adding even more mistakes, see)
2016-06-19 12:59:58	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-19 13:00:12	@Espyo	it's probably a transcription mistake
2016-06-19 13:00:15	@Espyo	I'll check in a bit
2016-06-19 13:00:23	Marty2000	I may check afterwards, but I dunno if - Oh, okay

2016-06-19 15:22:12	@Espyo	I always found them annoying
2016-06-19 15:22:20	@Espyo	the harvesting mechanic is enough of a hassle as it is
2016-06-19 15:22:22	@Espyo	which isn't a bad thing
2016-06-19 15:22:29	@Espyo	but adding to that that random enemy is a bit aggressive
2016-06-19 15:22:37	@Espyo	but it made more sense in Pikmin 2, since you have all the time in the world
2016-06-19 15:22:47	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-19 15:23:05	@Espyo	in Pikmin 3, in Mission Mode, last thing I'd want is to entrust some Pikmin to a Spiderwort, and then come 5 minutes later, I need a spray, and there is none, because the game decided there should be a Whiskerpillar there...
2016-06-19 15:23:54	Marty2000	Yeah, I don't like the harvestin mechanic in general (particularly in P2)
2016-06-19 15:24:08	Marty2000	In P3 mission mode's, I think I never harvest berries either
2016-06-19 15:24:42	@Espyo	yeah, I rarely do too

2016-06-19 15:38:22	Marty2000	"Mole"
2016-06-19 15:39:03	Marty2000	"Imo" would be "Potato"... but that sounds quite strange
2016-06-19 15:39:57	@Espyo	heh, I was just checking translations myself
2016-06-19 15:40:00	@Espyo	yeah, that's it
2016-06-19 15:40:09	@Espyo	my only guess about "potato" is how the kakureimo looks like one
2016-06-19 15:40:14	@Espyo	wait
2016-06-19 15:40:14	Marty2000	What a coincidence, indeed... heh
2016-06-19 15:40:14	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-19 15:40:26	@Espyo	I think "imo" means something else

2016-06-19 16:15:50	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Captain_Olimar#Names_in_other_languages I do think we should put the translations for "Captain Olimar" and not "OLimar" (because logically, it will always be Olimar :p )
2016-06-19 16:16:25	Marty2000	While "Captain" will change for some languages (not German, though)
2016-06-19 16:16:36	@Espyo	hmmmm, good point
2016-06-19 16:17:11	Marty2000	I already know two translations: French and Spanish... I will check for Italian
2016-06-19 16:18:30	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-19 16:18:59	Marty2000	Yoshi2: do you also use "Captain" in German, or did they want to leave "Captain" in the German version?
2016-06-19 16:19:48	Yoshi2	captain in German is Kapitän
2016-06-19 16:20:12	Marty2000	Well... in-game, they still call him "Captain Olimar" :p

2016-06-19 16:20:34	Marty2000	(I've already double-checked)
2016-06-19 16:21:03	Yoshi2	I guess they wanted to leave him as Captain

2016-06-19 20:42:23	Marty2000	Hmm, Espyo, for the presentation of the "Seed" article, I imagine it being similar to this article http://www.pikminwiki.com/Blunt_force
2016-06-19 20:42:27	Marty2000	"Crushing" = "Seed"   "Stabbing" = "Sprout"  "Rock Pikmin " = "Pluck" (with Main article, I think it should be good)  and "others" (glitch with maturity, or impossible for some enemies to bury 100 Pikmin)
2016-06-19 20:42:38	Marty2000	Hello again and again and again UltraMario

2016-06-19 23:17:05	@PikFan	so... I bet he's a friend of Thomas
2016-06-19 23:17:22	G98	Jake, get fiber

2016-06-19 23:30:32	@PikFan	oh, so I posted on miiverse last night complaining about poor teammates
2016-06-19 23:30:50	@PikFan	and someone says "bad teammates isn't an excuse unless you're calling yourself a noob"
2016-06-19 23:30:51	@PikFan	uh

2016-06-19 23:31:20	@PikFan	it's possible to have those kinds of teammates
2016-06-19 23:31:30	@PikFan	so I'm not allowed to blame my teammates for acting poorly?

2016-06-20 00:05:05	@Espyo	what was it?
2016-06-20 00:05:15	@PikFan	"why not?"

2016-06-20 00:10:03	@PikFan	night Yoshi2
2016-06-20 00:10:12	@Espyo	well, what else, then?
2016-06-20 00:10:22	@PikFan	99 kills/deaths
2016-06-20 00:10:26	Yoshi2|offline	or maybe espyo is spoiled by what can be done in pikmin with actual modding

2016-06-20 00:10:29	Yoshi2|offline	:^)
2016-06-20 00:10:38	@PikFan	huge scores in turf wars
2016-06-20 00:10:47	@PikFan	glitches
2016-06-20 00:10:58	@PikFan	...these could all be science, I guess
2016-06-20 00:11:07	@PikFan	but wouldn't it be fun to recreate them yourself?
2016-06-20 00:11:10	@Espyo	well, for one thing, people already did that
2016-06-20 00:11:10	Marty2000	I see, everybody likes what they like
2016-06-20 00:11:15	@Espyo	secondly, 100% coverage with 3 people?
2016-06-20 00:12:01	Marty2000	I say* not I see
2016-06-20 00:12:04	@PikFan	but wouldn't it be fun to recreate them yourself?
2016-06-20 00:12:15	@Espyo	well
2016-06-20 00:12:18	@Espyo	there's no skill to it
2016-06-20 00:12:29	@Espyo	just do it and do it and do it till you reach 99 kills
2016-06-20 00:12:32	@Espyo	and then you see the 99
2016-06-20 00:12:33	@Espyo	and that's it
2016-06-20 00:12:38	@Espyo	I'd be more interested in knowing if it's possible
2016-06-20 00:12:41	@Espyo	but now that I know, *shrug*
2016-06-20 00:13:07	@Espyo	back when the game was younger, me and some friends decided to do a Roller merry-go-round
2016-06-20 00:13:11	@Espyo	to try to get a lot of ink coverage
2016-06-20 00:13:14	@Espyo	didn't... go well
2016-06-20 00:14:05	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-20 00:15:25	@PikFan	why is it that adults' views of fun are so drastically different
2016-06-20 00:15:35	UltraMario	^
2016-06-20 00:15:52	UltraMario	:p
2016-06-20 00:15:52	Marty2000	Well, you cannot force someone to like something
2016-06-20 00:15:55	UltraMario	true
2016-06-20 00:15:59	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-20 00:16:05	@Espyo	don't think like that
2016-06-20 00:16:07	Marty2000	On the other hand... these pikmin can't say it's shit because they don't like ;)
2016-06-20 00:16:07	Testyo	Hey! I'm underage! Don't swear near me!
2016-06-20 00:16:08	@Espyo	it's just Splatoon
2016-06-20 00:16:12	@Espyo	I mess around on Smash all the time
2016-06-20 00:16:18	@Espyo	we play for fun, with items and all
2016-06-20 00:16:23	@Espyo	but even then sometimes we just play on stupid stages
2016-06-20 00:16:26	@Espyo	with spiky floors
2016-06-20 00:16:30	@Espyo	or trapped stages with no way out
2016-06-20 00:16:36	@Espyo	or 2x damage ratio 300%
2016-06-20 00:16:48	@Espyo	it's just that Splatoon is neat for science, not so neat to do stupid stuff on
2016-06-20 00:16:54	@Espyo	and all the science is already done
2016-06-20 00:17:07	@Espyo	unless I can find something new with some glitch or technique, I'd rather use my time on something else
2016-06-20 00:17:50	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-20 00:17:54	@PikFan	well, I rest my case
2016-06-20 00:18:35	Marty2000	Nobody read what I wrote :p
2016-06-20 00:18:45	Marty2000	and I said "pikmin" instead of "people", heh :/
2016-06-20 00:18:55	@PikFan	I read it
2016-06-20 00:19:02	@PikFan	I wasn't sure how to respond to it
2016-06-20 00:19:06	UltraMario	im a smash casual too :p
2016-06-20 00:19:07	@Espyo	I thought you were commenting on how the Pikmin can't say what they like and don't because they're forced to do labor :|
2016-06-20 00:19:16	UltraMario	but some stages are shit to me, even as a casual :P
2016-06-20 00:19:19	 *	UltraMario glares at 75m
2016-06-20 00:19:21	@Espyo	I'd like to try 100% coverage one day, but a lot of better and more coordinated people than us already tried it in the past, and failed
2016-06-20 00:19:22	Marty2000	I see :)
2016-06-20 00:19:30	@Espyo	so... between wasting my time and not wasting it... yeah
2016-06-20 00:20:12	Marty2000	Well, you can say you don't want to do it or participate to it, but I'm not sure it's wasting your time, though
2016-06-20 00:20:23	@Espyo	if I know I can't do it, it is 
2016-06-20 00:20:24	Marty2000	People still have fun trying, I suppose
2016-06-20 00:20:36	@Espyo	the most fun I'd have would be to zone out for one or two matches and just paint paint paint
2016-06-20 00:20:39	@Espyo	which IS fun
2016-06-20 00:20:45	@PikFan	again, that feels like a limited mindest
2016-06-20 00:20:45	@Espyo	but doing that more than 3 times is just boring and repetitive
2016-06-20 00:20:48	@PikFan	*mindset
2016-06-20 00:20:51	@Espyo	nonsense
2016-06-20 00:21:19	@Espyo	anyway, bed time
2016-06-20 00:21:20	@Espyo	good night
2016-06-20 00:21:24	@PikFan	night
2016-06-20 00:21:30	Marty2000	Well, as I said, nobody forces to like something
2016-06-20 00:21:31	Marty2000	Night
2016-06-20 00:21:39	@PikFan	...maybe I'm the one with the bad mindset
2016-06-20 00:21:47	Marty2000	And so, I don't force to play that
2016-06-20 00:21:53	@Espyo	you can do whatever you want with whomever you want, as long as everybody agrees it's a good idea
2016-06-20 00:21:57	Marty2000	But I think it shouldn't be said that it's wasting our time, just all
2016-06-20 00:22:00	@Espyo	but not everybody has to like every activity

2016-06-20 00:23:15	@PikFan	I'm... not really in a hackery-mood right now, after the shenanigans yesterday
2016-06-20 00:23:29	Marty2000	Okay, no problem :p
2016-06-20 00:23:35	Marty2000	Don't hesitate if you want them some day
2016-06-20 00:23:40	@PikFan	heh, alright
2016-06-20 00:31:45	Marty2000	Hmm, I think I have a date for when I should leave. It's probably from June 30th to July 10th
2016-06-20 00:32:45	@PikFan	I'll be out of town from June 29th to July 6th
2016-06-20 00:32:52	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-20 00:33:18	Marty2000	It might be longer though, for me, I can't exaclty now, but that's what it should be
2016-06-20 00:33:44	Marty2000	I will bring my 3DS, but I won't be able to bring my Wii U...
2016-06-20 00:33:49	Marty2000	Too bad :/
2016-06-20 00:33:54	Marty2000	No Pikmin science and no Splatoon

2016-06-20 01:57:46	@PikFan	uh
2016-06-20 01:57:50	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-20 01:57:52	@PikFan	except if you go to someone's page
2016-06-20 01:58:00	@PikFan	you can see their NNID next to their username
2016-06-20 01:58:03	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-20 01:58:43	Marty2000	But Nintendo wants a perfectly ordered world in which everybody abides to rules that are for the best
2016-06-20 01:58:49	Marty2000	So, we have to accept
2016-06-20 01:59:03	Marty2000	Because we are people that must accept, thhat's it ;)

2016-06-20 11:54:27	Marty2000	Well, that's still not correct, in my opinion.
2016-06-20 11:54:45	Marty2000	But it's not a big problem, so I'll ask Espyo later if we can leave it as it is currently

2016-06-20 14:54:53	Klemen702	i have LDTEB
2016-06-20 14:55:00	Klemen702	Lifeless Due To Extreme Boredom
2016-06-20 14:55:13	Klemen702	and all i can do is whine about it :P
2016-06-20 14:55:13	Marty2000	Then, let's have fun together, and welcome :D
2016-06-20 14:55:32	Klemen702	alright
2016-06-20 14:55:40	Klemen702	and yes i did just come up with LDTEB
2016-06-20 14:56:03	Marty2000	So, since you seem to be good at finding ideas... We have to finish writing something for UltraMario|Sleep
2016-06-20 14:56:11	Marty2000	The start of what we'e got to write is:
2016-06-20 14:56:15	Marty2000	Noble UltraMario, we adore him / We shall abide and... wish him glory / Lord of Earthlings / Noble UltraMario, we bless him / May he guide us to a bright future / Let us pray for Her Majesty UltraMario
2016-06-20 14:56:23	Marty2000	Do you have any idea for the next part?
2016-06-20 14:56:59	Klemen702	first i have to ask
2016-06-20 14:57:01	Klemen702	what is this
2016-06-20 14:57:28	Marty2000	We decided to present our deepest apologies to UltraMario for always joking on him
2016-06-20 14:57:39	Marty2000	So whenever we enter his chat ( #ultramariochat )
2016-06-20 14:57:42	Marty2000	We have to sing this
2016-06-20 14:58:44	Marty2000	I understand your "word-less-ness", don't worry
2016-06-20 14:59:00	Klemen702	well
2016-06-20 14:59:03	Klemen702	i have a sentence
2016-06-20 14:59:11	Klemen702	but i have no idea if it actually makes sense
2016-06-20 14:59:24	Klemen702	''For we desire to sacrifice ourselves for him.''
2016-06-20 14:59:29	Marty2000	Nothing makes sense here, so don't worry ;)
2016-06-20 14:59:41	Klemen702	after that could be more sentences in a similar ''format''
2016-06-20 14:59:57	Marty2000	I'd say "For him we desire to sacrifice ourselves"
2016-06-20 15:00:00	Marty2000	But that's great
2016-06-20 15:00:09	Marty2000	Let's ask Yoshi2 about what he thinks of this
2016-06-20 15:00:10	Klemen702	you can use that too
2016-06-20 15:00:40	Klemen702	after that one you could also have someting that is 50% similar
2016-06-20 15:00:42	Klemen702	for example
2016-06-20 15:00:49	Klemen702	''For him we desire fortune and glory.''
2016-06-20 15:01:03	Klemen702	and keeps repeating until a certain point
2016-06-20 15:01:37	Marty2000	Yeah, that's neat
2016-06-20 15:03:20	Marty2000	Klemen702: do you have a Wii U?

2016-06-20 15:04:59	Marty2000	(I didn't see your "l" :p )

2016-06-20 15:05:56	Klemen702	scrapped what i had in mind
2016-06-20 15:06:28	Klemen702	actually
2016-06-20 15:06:31	Klemen702	i'll write it anyway
2016-06-20 15:06:36	Klemen702	''And while the fellow thrives''
2016-06-20 15:06:47	Klemen702	''He needs to survive (no sense)''
2016-06-20 15:06:50	Klemen702	''And while we arrive''
2016-06-20 15:06:55	Klemen702	''We help him come alive!''
2016-06-20 15:07:49	Marty2000	I had some inspiration from that (spoilers "Kirby Planet Robobot")

2016-06-20 15:10:30	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-20 15:11:38	Marty2000	(you can refer to UltraMario as she or he, by the way)
2016-06-20 15:13:43	Klemen702	can i refer to it as an it
2016-06-20 15:13:55	Klemen702	it's the least sexist option ;)

2016-06-20 15:16:47	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-20 15:41:11	Klemen702	can i ask a question that OBVIOUSLY you woudn't know
2016-06-20 15:41:20	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-20 15:42:39	Klemen702	after a cattle (it's a young farm animal?) get's born
2016-06-20 15:42:47	Klemen702	do they let it get raised with it's mother
2016-06-20 15:43:00	Klemen702	or do they emidietly kill the mother for food
2016-06-20 15:43:15	Klemen702	in.. whatever you should call them. industries?
2016-06-20 15:43:32	Marty2000	Hmm, usually, they get separated from their mothers
2016-06-20 15:44:15	Klemen702	immediatly after birth?
2016-06-20 15:44:28	Marty2000	1 day or two, I think
2016-06-20 15:47:16	Marty2000	Klemen702

2016-06-20 18:58:30	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-06-20 18:58:30	Testyo	I changed a lot of my code until I stopped and realized my sub-bitmap problem with timing
2016-06-20 18:59:02	UltraMario	hey espyo ive learned some smash modding stuff lately
2016-06-20 18:59:07	UltraMario	im getting into this :D
2016-06-20 19:06:05	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Thirsty_Desert_Remix#Gallery Made the Gallery and added screenshots, hope it's enough!
2016-06-20 19:07:19	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-20 19:07:25	@Espyo	Brawl, or Smash 4?
2016-06-20 19:07:37	@Espyo	seems enough to me, Marty
2016-06-20 19:07:38	@Espyo	nice
2016-06-20 19:08:05	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-06-20 19:08:05	Testyo	or is that aint for about a week, though

2016-06-20 19:09:15	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-20 19:10:16	Marty2000	Ah, also, I don't know if you saw that http://www.pikminwiki.com/Talk:Lesser_Mock_Bottom for "Crepusculito" ;)
2016-06-20 19:10:37	Marty2000	Normally, bottom is "culo" in Spanish
2016-06-20 19:10:42	Marty2000	But "ito" is a diminutive
2016-06-20 19:10:52	Marty2000	Which makes culo "culito" (little bottom)
2016-06-20 19:12:34	Marty2000	Hmm, and I think Brittany mentions "culo" in her description of the fruit
2016-06-20 19:12:46	Marty2000	I will check, since I have to add Spanish names
2016-06-20 19:12:53	@J	ham, radish and pickled beetroot sandwiches are not bad
2016-06-20 19:13:10	@J	 /relevant
2016-06-20 19:13:19	@Espyo	ah, you're right
2016-06-20 19:13:21	@Espyo	so it's a pun
2016-06-20 19:13:25	@Espyo	crepusculo + culito
2016-06-20 19:13:35	@Espyo	too green for me, J
2016-06-20 19:13:37	Marty2000	Yeah, I think that
2016-06-20 19:13:53	Marty2000	Oh, J, many vegetables, I love it! :D
2016-06-20 19:14:11	Marty2000	Espyo: I think we could explain it by adding a note
2016-06-20 19:14:17	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-20 19:14:24	Marty2000	Since it's not instantaneously clear too
2016-06-20 19:14:41	Marty2000	(you have to check the description to understand that it's a pun)
2016-06-20 19:14:59	Marty2000	Because it could also be a diminutive for "crepúsculo" too...
2016-06-20 19:15:00	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-20 19:15:05	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-06-20 19:16:18	Yoshi2	J: you always reply out of the blue with food-related stuff
2016-06-20 19:16:38	UltraMario	Espyo: smash 4

2016-06-20 19:16:50	UltraMario	modding is growing fast
2016-06-20 19:17:35	@Espyo	seems like it, yeah
2016-06-20 19:18:07	Yoshi2	modding only has one way to go, really
2016-06-20 19:18:17	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Pikmin family by 24.32.13.189 (+40) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=1253&diff=167437
2016-06-20 19:18:23	@Espyo	well, yeah, but there are different speeds
2016-06-20 19:18:51	UltraMario	true
2016-06-20 19:19:06	Yoshi2	which is related to how many people are working on it and how easy it is to figure out
2016-06-20 19:19:38	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-20 19:20:38	UltraMario	smash 4 is definitely more organized than braw;l
2016-06-20 19:20:40	UltraMario	:>
2016-06-20 19:20:42	@Espyo	oh, I bet
2016-06-20 19:21:05	UltraMario	for example all the alts ids are actually the same as the in-game order
2016-06-20 19:21:07	UltraMario	unlike brawl's
2016-06-20 19:21:16	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-06-20 19:21:19	@Espyo	I remember that being janky
2016-06-20 19:21:25	UltraMario	and you can add like an absurd number of costume slots
2016-06-20 19:21:31	UltraMario	like 255 or something
2016-06-20 19:21:32	UltraMario	lol
2016-06-20 19:21:41	UltraMario	for each character!
2016-06-20 19:22:32	Yoshi2	from the developer's prespective, it is probably easier to aim high and then go lower, than aim low and then have to rewrite everything
2016-06-20 19:22:39	UltraMario	true
2016-06-20 19:22:49	UltraMario	smash 4 is also a lot more stable
2016-06-20 19:23:01	UltraMario	with brawl you had constant crashing when you tried certain mod things

2016-06-20 19:23:22	UltraMario	and smash 4 probably has the most stable model swapping in the whole series
2016-06-20 19:23:31	UltraMario	as in like swap one character's model over another
2016-06-20 19:23:33	UltraMario	:p
2016-06-20 19:24:03	@Espyo	definitely moreso in Smash 4, since there's DLC
2016-06-20 19:24:07	UltraMario	yeah
2016-06-20 19:24:28	UltraMario	it seems like they did a lot of ways to avoid crashes and whatnot :p

2016-06-20 19:25:12	UltraMario	what kind of mod are you talking?
2016-06-20 19:25:14	UltraMario	like a texture edit?
2016-06-20 19:25:20	Marty2000	Whatever
2016-06-20 19:25:23	Marty2000	Any mod will work fine
2016-06-20 19:25:24	UltraMario	yeah
2016-06-20 19:25:36	UltraMario	theres a few texture edits for kirby
2016-06-20 19:25:46	Marty2000	Nice
2016-06-20 19:25:57	@Espyo	good grief people, it's not that hard
2016-06-20 19:26:02	@Espyo	I'll fix the image in a bit
2016-06-20 19:26:04	UltraMario	ill make a mod pack for the tourney soon enough :)
2016-06-20 19:26:13	@Espyo	I guess it makes sense to keep the clay one, since the other Pikmin on that page are clay too
2016-06-20 19:26:45	Yoshi2	I started generating tables for all the possible attributes in BW: https://www.reddit.com/r/battalionwarsmod/wiki/index/level/troop
2016-06-20 19:27:01	@Espyo	eep
2016-06-20 19:27:07	@Espyo	that's not long at all

2016-06-20 19:27:22	UltraMario	i miss fourside
2016-06-20 19:27:37	Yoshi2	saved a bit of space by splitting the attributes into 3 groups
2016-06-20 19:27:58	Yoshi2	those that are available in both games, those that are only in one game, and those that are only in the other game
2016-06-20 19:28:24	@Espyo	yeah, great idea
2016-06-20 19:28:34	Yoshi2	I asked one of the other mods about the BW wikia and he agreed that it's a mess, so reddit's wiki system will have to do ¯\(ツ)/¯  
2016-06-20 19:28:55	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-20 19:28:58	@Espyo	better than wikia
2016-06-20 19:30:41	Marty2000	Espyo: don't bother. I set it to 100px, I hope it's not too big
2016-06-20 19:31:15	Marty2000	The image was too small at 50px
2016-06-20 19:31:30	@Espyo	did you put it as a thumbnail?
2016-06-20 19:31:36	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-20 19:31:43	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-20 19:32:20	Marty2000	I'll put 80px, it's better

2016-06-20 19:34:25	@Espyo	eh, that's pretty small...
2016-06-20 19:34:32	@Espyo	but I guess there's no other way to do it that won't take up too much space
2016-06-20 19:34:42	@Espyo	also, the floatings should intercalate
2016-06-20 19:34:48	@Espyo	I'll try my hand at it in a bit
2016-06-20 19:35:16	Marty2000	Well, yeah, it would take too much space in my opinion, the other Pikmin looked small in comparison

2016-06-20 19:38:23	@Espyo	oh? does the sound come from something, or did someone record themselves?

2016-06-20 19:39:17	Marty2000	Oh, the head seems bizarre to me, indeed (too similar to Olimar's)
2016-06-20 19:39:28	UltraMario	well, it was edited from alph, so :p
2016-06-20 19:39:36	Marty2000	I would prefer Brittany :)

2016-06-20 20:07:38	Marty2000	Into plants

2016-06-20 20:09:36	Marty2000	Getting out of bounds is pretty much normal gameplay in Pikmin, though :p

2016-06-20 20:10:16	Marty2000	Hmm... well, you're not supposed to go there, but it's not really a glitch, because you use normal means
2016-06-20 20:10:20	Marty2000	I just threw a captain
2016-06-20 20:10:28	Marty2000	But you're not supposed to go here, yeah

2016-06-20 20:12:02	Marty2000	I don't think it's really a glitch, but once again, you're not supposed to go here, although you can by pressing a button :p

2016-06-20 23:36:49	@PikFan	since Pikmin 3 hacking is getting better and better
2016-06-20 23:36:53	@Espyo	yeah?
2016-06-20 23:36:59	@PikFan	will it be possible to rip audio files from it?
2016-06-20 23:37:27	<--	Miles (Miles@694-146-608-45.res.bhn.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2016-06-20 23:38:02	@Espyo	well, not necessarily
2016-06-20 23:38:10	@Espyo	people keep discovering the format behind more and more of Nintendo's files
2016-06-20 23:38:17	@Espyo	and if P3's audio files use a format that most other Nintendo games use
2016-06-20 23:38:24	<--	Scruffy (Mibbit@179-777-1-60.lightspeed.chtnsc.sbcglobal.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-06-20 23:38:25	@Espyo	then someday, somebody will likely be able to crack open this type of file
2016-06-20 23:38:32	@Espyo	and we can use that knowledge to get the audio too
2016-06-20 23:38:46	@Espyo	but if Pikmin 3 uses a different format, somebody else is gonna have to try to crack it open
2016-06-20 23:39:15	@PikFan	hmmm
2016-06-20 23:39:39	@PikFan	is it hard to open those files because the file formats aren't like formats we typically use?
2016-06-20 23:39:49	@Espyo	bingo
2016-06-20 23:39:58	@Espyo	to put it simply...
2016-06-20 23:40:01	@Espyo	most formats could be like
2016-06-20 23:40:34	@Espyo	"at second 0, we have a loud sound. At second 0'001, we have the same sound, slightly lower, but higher pitched. At second 0'002, we have..."
2016-06-20 23:40:43	@Espyo	and as far as we know, Nintendo could save their audio data as
2016-06-20 23:41:32	@Espyo	"At second 30, you have sound. This sound is the same as seconds 0 and 500 combined, but multiplied by a number that only us, Nintendo, know. Also, grab that number and divide it by the combined health of all enemies to get the pitch. Now, at 0'005, we have..."
2016-06-20 23:41:43	@Espyo	or other crazy nonsense
2016-06-20 23:41:49	@Espyo	it's Nintendo, so YES, that is possible
2016-06-20 23:41:55	@Espyo	buncha weirdos...
2016-06-20 23:42:22	@PikFan	do they purposely make it complicated so that people like us can't get into it easily
2016-06-20 23:42:40	@Espyo	that's one reason
2016-06-20 23:43:01	@Espyo	another could just be that their sound cards are REALLY good at combining numbers on places 0 and 500, and dividing them by another number
2016-06-20 23:43:12	@Espyo	oh, there's also another reason, which is important for Pikmin 3
2016-06-20 23:43:13	@Espyo	at least for music
2016-06-20 23:43:27	@Espyo	music in the Pikmin games isn't as simple as an MP3 file, even if it uses another format
2016-06-20 23:43:37	@Espyo	it has to have information for what causes different parts to play or not play
2016-06-20 23:43:44	@Espyo	because of the carrying variation, fighting variation, etc.
2016-06-20 23:43:55	@Espyo	and according to Yoshi2, there's even more shenanigans than just that
2016-06-20 23:43:58	@Espyo	so it's a LOT of guess-work
2016-06-20 23:44:14	@PikFan	weird...
2016-06-20 23:44:54	@PikFan	it's just that we've managed to get all the audio files (or most, anyway) from P1 and 2, but not 3
2016-06-20 23:45:02	@PikFan	and 3's been out for nearly 3 years...
2016-06-20 23:45:12	Marty2000	COme to think of it for these variations, Espyo: do you remember that I told you the enemy variation playeed (in P1) when several Pikmin drowned at the same place?
2016-06-20 23:45:13	@PikFan	but I guess it takes longer than that to crack them open
2016-06-20 23:45:25	Marty2000	Well, the same happens if several Pikmin drink nectar at once
2016-06-20 23:45:37	@Espyo	yeah, depends on how many people are interested in cracking it, too
2016-06-20 23:45:44	@Espyo	but sound effects are usually simple
2016-06-20 23:45:48	@Espyo	because they don't have that variation thing and all
2016-06-20 23:45:49	@PikFan	Marty, how are you always discovering tiny details like these :P
2016-06-20 23:45:57	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-06-20 23:46:00	@Espyo	really? nectar?
2016-06-20 23:46:02	@Espyo	what in the world...
2016-06-20 23:46:07	Marty2000	Yes

2016-06-20 23:46:15	Marty2000	PikFan: vampires see everything :)
2016-06-20 23:46:17	@Espyo	isn't there a section in there that explains the rules behind the enemy variations?
2016-06-20 23:46:25	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-06-20 23:46:33	Marty2000	But I don't remember seiing that for water and nectar
2016-06-20 23:46:42	@Espyo	not quite
2016-06-20 23:46:45	@Espyo	but you can add that info
2016-06-20 23:46:50	@Espyo	on the "Areas" section
2016-06-20 23:46:52	@Espyo	on the opening paragraph
2016-06-20 23:47:01	@Espyo	we can probably add it to DYK too
2016-06-20 23:47:07	Marty2000	Pellet Posies (even younger buds), geysers, and Candypop Buds are all considered enemies in the game; as such the enemy mix is added to the theme whenever Captain Olimar is interacting with them.
2016-06-20 23:47:17	Marty2000	Also, some Pellet Posies do not trigger the enemy variation :)
2016-06-20 23:47:21	Marty2000	In the Forest of Hope
2016-06-20 23:47:28	Marty2000	Which makes everything even harder...
2016-06-20 23:47:53	Marty2000	Or, some only trigger the enemy variation once they get hit by a punch/Pikmin
2016-06-20 23:48:11	@Espyo	ugh...
2016-06-20 23:48:45	Marty2000	For Candypop Buds, it's quite similar
2016-06-20 23:49:09	Marty2000	For some of them, you need to touch them with Olimar or throw a Pikmin into them  to trigger the variation
2016-06-20 23:49:39	Marty2000	I should test more, but I had tested some nights ago, and that were my only conclusions
2016-06-20 23:50:47	Marty2000	I think we should also see if thiss new behaviour " (making it possible to have the neemy variation) is kept as days pass
2016-06-20 23:50:50	Marty2000	enemy*
2016-06-20 23:50:55	Marty2000	this*
2016-06-20 23:50:57	Marty2000	(sorry)
2016-06-20 23:51:45	@Espyo	weird stuff...
2016-06-20 23:51:46	@Espyo	as usual
2016-06-20 23:52:15	Marty2000	Yeah, always weird
2016-06-20 23:52:24	Marty2000	And that one will be harder to solve... I suppose
2016-06-20 23:52:29	Marty2000	that one mystery
2016-06-20 23:54:03	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-06-20 23:54:25	Marty2000	Anyway, I'll try on the Wii version tomorrow, to see if I can come up with any viable conclusion. I think I know a little how it should work for Candypop Buds, Pellet Posies, water, nectar... but we also need to try other things (what if I make some bomb rocks explode somewhere? Will the enemy variation trigger?)
2016-06-20 23:55:24	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-20 23:57:44	Marty2000	Same for fire geysers
2016-06-21 00:02:24	@Espyo	right

2016-06-21 00:04:50	Marty2000	I mean, I think it should be more active since there are more American people on Pikipedia (I guess?)

2016-06-21 00:05:15	@PikFan	more American people?
2016-06-21 00:05:19	@PikFan	I beg to differ
2016-06-21 00:05:30	Marty2000	Well, I suppose, but I am not sure
2016-06-21 00:05:30	@PikFan	I think it's half and half
2016-06-21 00:05:45	Marty2000	I just suppose that because most of the articles have American information, actually
2016-06-21 00:05:46	Marty2000	I see 
2016-06-21 00:05:52	@PikFan	there's you, Espyo, Yoshi2, sleepi, and J

2016-06-21 00:06:00	Marty2000	Yeah, that's true
2016-06-21 00:06:05	@PikFan	so 5 Europeans
2016-06-21 00:06:26	@PikFan	then me, Scruffy, En Passant, UltraMario
2016-06-21 00:06:34	@PikFan	and whoever else feels like getting on
2016-06-21 00:06:42	@PikFan	...okay, so yeah, more Americans
2016-06-21 00:06:45	@PikFan	but just slightly :P
2016-06-21 00:06:49	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-21 00:07:35	Marty2000	Ah, speaking of Americans, ISK*WOMMY sent me a friend request
2016-06-21 00:07:50	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-06-21 00:08:02	@PikFan	yesterday's squad matches were hard
2016-06-21 00:08:12	Marty2000	Oh,  yeah
2016-06-21 00:08:19	@PikFan	I don't know how you survive in S+
2016-06-21 00:08:22	Marty2000	I hope you didn't have any disconnections while playing Ranked, by the way
2016-06-21 00:08:34	@PikFan	one
2016-06-21 00:08:36	@PikFan	just one
2016-06-21 00:08:39	@PikFan	lost 5 points
2016-06-21 00:08:41	Marty2000	Well, as I said, it's pretty much luck
2016-06-21 00:08:45	Marty2000	No...!
2016-06-21 00:08:51	Marty2000	Are you A+ again? :/
2016-06-21 00:08:56	@PikFan	S0
2016-06-21 00:09:13	Marty2000	Ah, well, you had disconnected before we played together
2016-06-21 00:09:14	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 00:09:20	@PikFan	...I did?
2016-06-21 00:09:22	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-21 00:09:32	@PikFan	well, a couple nights ago I was at S10
2016-06-21 00:09:35	Marty2000	You were S0 before we played together in Rankeed, yeah
2016-06-21 00:09:40	Marty2000	Ranked*
2016-06-21 00:09:42	@PikFan	then I decided to play some matches
2016-06-21 00:10:06	@PikFan	I went up to S15 but then disconnected, so I went back down to S10
2016-06-21 00:10:06	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 00:10:10	@PikFan	then lost 2 more matches
2016-06-21 00:10:15	@PikFan	and here I am at S0
2016-06-21 00:10:30	@PikFan	highest I've ever been was like S509
2016-06-21 00:10:34	@PikFan	*S50
2016-06-21 00:10:40	Marty2000	S509 is great
2016-06-21 00:10:42	@PikFan	or maybe S54
2016-06-21 00:10:46	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 00:10:58	@PikFan	...it's dumb how it gives you less and less points
2016-06-21 00:11:07	@PikFan	in S+, isn't it like 2 points per win?
2016-06-21 00:11:14	Marty2000	Well, I recommend that you wait for your favorite stages (and modes, if you have)
2016-06-21 00:11:22	Marty2000	Well, it changed with updates
2016-06-21 00:11:27	Marty2000	Let me see Inkipedia
2016-06-21 00:11:33	Marty2000	But yeah
2016-06-21 00:11:37	Marty2000	That' spretty much it
2016-06-21 00:11:42	Marty2000	And between
2016-06-21 00:11:43	@PikFan	wow
2016-06-21 00:11:46	Marty2000	S+90 and S+99
2016-06-21 00:11:56	Marty2000	You'd lost 8 points before the update
2016-06-21 00:12:01	Marty2000	would lose*
2016-06-21 00:12:10	Marty2000	And only win 2
2016-06-21 00:12:12	Marty2000	per victory
2016-06-21 00:12:27	Marty2000	So, I'll look for an article on Inkipedia
2016-06-21 00:13:58	@PikFan	http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Rank
2016-06-21 00:14:01	@PikFan	eeugh
2016-06-21 00:14:21	@PikFan	at S+80 and higher you only win 2 points
2016-06-21 00:14:23	@PikFan	but still lose 5
2016-06-21 00:14:27	@PikFan	that's awful
2016-06-21 00:14:28	Marty2000	Oh, nice
2016-06-21 00:14:47	Marty2000	Well, that's the current table
2016-06-21 00:14:54	Marty2000	I'm looking for the precedent one
2016-06-21 00:16:23	Marty2000	http://splatoonwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Rank&type=revision&diff=34533&oldid=33211 Well, t's not what I'm exactly looking for
2016-06-21 00:16:25	Marty2000	But look
2016-06-21 00:16:31	Marty2000	You'd already lose 6 points per loss
2016-06-21 00:17:03	@PikFan	you mean back then
2016-06-21 00:17:04	@PikFan	?
2016-06-21 00:17:36	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 00:17:59	@PikFan	wow
2016-06-21 00:18:05	@PikFan	that's even worse
2016-06-21 00:18:07	Marty2000	Ah!!!
2016-06-21 00:18:09	Marty2000	Found it!
2016-06-21 00:18:18	Marty2000	http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Version_2.2.0#Rank_Adjustments
2016-06-21 00:18:26	Marty2000	80-99
2016-06-21 00:18:30	Marty2000	Win +2
2016-06-21 00:18:36	Marty2000	Lose -8
2016-06-21 00:18:48	Marty2000	Reminds me the horror I had when I wanted to rank up :/
2016-06-21 00:19:30	Marty2000	They really decreased the number of points lost, that's cool
2016-06-21 00:19:40	Marty2000	From -8 to -5, there's a difference
2016-06-21 00:19:46	@PikFan	o.o
2016-06-21 00:20:03	@PikFan	if you lost a battle...
2016-06-21 00:20:10	@PikFan	you'd have to win 4 battles to make up for it
2016-06-21 00:20:13	@PikFan	that's...
2016-06-21 00:20:17	Marty2000	Yeah :/
2016-06-21 00:22:35	Marty2000	This makes me want to make a new account and retry Ranked Battle from scratch, actually :D
2016-06-21 00:22:53	@PikFan	hmm
2016-06-21 00:23:06	Marty2000	Well, on another Nintendo ID
2016-06-21 00:23:19	Marty2000	I would certainly not delete my current game
2016-06-21 00:23:31	@PikFan	right
2016-06-21 00:44:17	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Main_Page "Featured article" "Koppaite text" I don't know what you think PikFan, but I do think we should put a little image of some Koppaite text here
2016-06-21 01:07:41	@PikFan	hmm, yeah
2016-06-21 01:11:47	Marty2000	Well, this is only my opinion... but it looks empty without image
2016-06-21 01:16:58	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-21 01:17:08	@PikFan	the problem is, I don't know what could be a good image
2016-06-21 01:17:38	@PikFan	we have images of the individual characters, but just one of them probably wouldn't be a good representation
2016-06-21 01:18:07	@PikFan	we could create an image with all the characters in it, but how would we do it in a way that saves space?
2016-06-21 01:18:18	@PikFan	I agree, it does need an image, but...
2016-06-21 01:21:22	Marty2000	Well, yeah, that's the problem.
2016-06-21 01:27:43	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-21 01:30:56	-->	Scruffy (Mibbit@179-777-1-60.lightspeed.chtnsc.sbcglobal.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-21 01:31:38	@PikFan	welcome back Scruffy
2016-06-21 01:31:46	Scruffy	Hi PikFan, thanks
2016-06-21 01:32:00	Scruffy	Sorry my Internet lapsed for quite a while
2016-06-21 01:32:08	Scruffy	We had a power outage
2016-06-21 01:32:14	@PikFan	fun
2016-06-21 01:32:14	Scruffy	But it's good now
2016-06-21 01:32:16	@PikFan	what caused it?
2016-06-21 01:32:26	Scruffy	Just storming
2016-06-21 01:32:33	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-06-21 01:33:26	@PikFan	for me, the only time the power went out because of weather was in an icestorm
2016-06-21 01:33:44	@PikFan	I think I told you that before, though
2016-06-21 01:33:48	Scruffy	yeah
2016-06-21 01:33:57	Scruffy	That's pretty scary
2016-06-21 01:34:00	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-21 01:34:03	Scruffy	I've rarely been in hail at most
2016-06-21 01:34:07	Scruffy	Hi Marty!
2016-06-21 01:34:11	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-21 01:34:24	@PikFan	the icestorm was unprecedented
2016-06-21 01:34:45	@PikFan	everything was coated in a quarter inch thick layer of ice
2016-06-21 01:34:56	Scruffy	Wow
2016-06-21 01:35:01	@PikFan	so everything looked unreal
2016-06-21 01:35:07	@PikFan	especially the plants
2016-06-21 01:35:29	Scruffy	Woah, that's crazy
2016-06-21 01:35:44	Scruffy	I looked up some images of it
2016-06-21 01:36:09	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-21 01:36:10	Scruffy	Here we've had a little ice, maybe a centimeter, coat the trees on one particularly cold snow day
2016-06-21 01:36:19	Scruffy	But that's it
2016-06-21 01:36:20	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-21 01:36:25	@PikFan	I guess it's called glaze ice
2016-06-21 01:36:28	@PikFan	that's what we had
2016-06-21 01:37:22	Scruffy	That's a good term for it
2016-06-21 01:37:33	@PikFan	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaze_ice
2016-06-21 01:37:42	Scruffy	Here we're known for our high temperatures
2016-06-21 01:38:10	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-06-21 01:38:28	@PikFan	you mentioned it got to 115 F last summer, right?
2016-06-21 01:38:35	Scruffy	Yep
2016-06-21 01:38:44	@PikFan	that's nuts
2016-06-21 01:39:17	Scruffy	Yeah, we couldn't really do anything but stay at home and sweat
2016-06-21 01:39:45	@PikFan	you couldn't even go swimming?
2016-06-21 01:39:55	Scruffy	I mean, you could, but there's a heat advisory
2016-06-21 01:40:12	@PikFan	true
2016-06-21 01:40:17	@PikFan	I would've gone swimming
2016-06-21 01:40:24	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-21 01:40:27	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-21 01:40:36	Scruffy	I did work at a water park last summer
2016-06-21 01:40:44	Scruffy	But swimming wasn't a benefit
2016-06-21 01:40:54	Scruffy	Half price on snacks was though :P
2016-06-21 01:41:09	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-21 01:46:54	Scruffy	So I've come up with some mechanics that I would "present" in the Pikmin Color Splash video
2016-06-21 01:46:57	Scruffy	And dare I say it
2016-06-21 01:47:12	Scruffy	The more I come up with the more I want Nintendo to actually make this just for fun
2016-06-21 01:47:22	@PikFan	hehe
2016-06-21 01:47:37	@PikFan	how long is the video going to be?
2016-06-21 01:47:41	Scruffy	I don't know
2016-06-21 01:47:59	@PikFan	and how will you present it? is it going to be a voice over?
2016-06-21 01:48:08	Scruffy	Making it trailer-length would be easier on blender, but making it E3-length would allow me to flesh out these ideas more
2016-06-21 01:48:30	Scruffy	Which would you rather see?
2016-06-21 01:48:42	Scruffy	A trailer for the game or an E3 demonstration of it?
2016-06-21 01:48:43	@PikFan	hrm........
2016-06-21 01:48:51	@PikFan	both
2016-06-21 01:48:53	@PikFan	/joking
2016-06-21 01:48:55	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-21 01:48:56	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-21 01:49:16	@PikFan	perhaps a demo
2016-06-21 01:49:25	Scruffy	Yeah...
2016-06-21 01:49:27	@PikFan	I'd like to see these ideas of yours
2016-06-21 01:49:33	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-21 01:49:40	Scruffy	That does sound more fun to make
2016-06-21 01:49:57	@PikFan	but if Blender can't handle it, a trailer is just as good
2016-06-21 01:49:59	Scruffy	Then when the video's done I get to narrate and act like I'm actually playing it :P
2016-06-21 01:50:11	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-21 01:50:14	Scruffy	I think this can go E3-length
2016-06-21 01:50:19	Scruffy	Paper is an easy material to render
2016-06-21 01:50:27	Scruffy	And the characters are all just planes
2016-06-21 01:50:35	@PikFan	right
2016-06-21 01:50:39	@PikFan	that makes sense
2016-06-21 01:50:58	Scruffy	The difficult part here will really be animating
2016-06-21 01:51:03	Scruffy	But I think I'm getting the hang of it
2016-06-21 02:01:19	Marty2000	PikFan: these are not incredible, but here a few ideas that could inspire us for the featured article: http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466470766-koppaite-text.jpg and 
2016-06-21 02:01:20	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466470769-koppaite-text-2.jpg

2016-06-21 02:01:54	@PikFan	I like the first one bes
2016-06-21 02:01:55	@PikFan	t
2016-06-21 02:02:09	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-21 02:02:13	@PikFan	though maybe make them more spaced out and change the background to white
2016-06-21 02:02:26	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 02:02:36	Marty2000	I just did it really fast to see what it'd look like
2016-06-21 02:02:40	Marty2000	I'll work on it tomorrow
2016-06-21 02:02:40	@PikFan	mhm
2016-06-21 02:02:48	@PikFan	oh, are you leaving?
2016-06-21 02:02:49	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-06-21 02:02:52	Marty2000	Not now
2016-06-21 02:02:56	@PikFan	alright
2016-06-21 02:03:00	Marty2000	But I don't want to work on it at 3 am :p
2016-06-21 02:03:05	@PikFan	hehe, yeah
2016-06-21 02:03:15	@PikFan	you night owl :P
2016-06-21 02:03:30	Marty2000	Night owls can be lazy :p
2016-06-21 02:03:41	Marty2000	(that should remind you of UltraMario)
2016-06-21 02:05:00	@PikFan	lol yup
2016-06-21 02:06:11	@PikFan	oh, since I'm on Pikmin 3 right now
2016-06-21 02:06:22	@PikFan	now would be a good time to check the Mission Mode world records
2016-06-21 02:06:27	Scruffy	Ooh yeah
2016-06-21 02:06:28	Marty2000	Ah, yeah
2016-06-21 02:06:44	@PikFan	it's been what, half a year since we posted them?
2016-06-21 02:06:49	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-21 02:06:53	Marty2000	December 2015
2016-06-21 02:07:37	Scruffy	There's probably that one prodigy somewhere who's beaten last year's scores by now
2016-06-21 02:07:45	Scruffy	I don't understand how they do it though
2016-06-21 02:07:55	Scruffy	I rarely do better than even 50% of players
2016-06-21 02:08:56	@PikFan	yup
2016-06-21 02:09:07	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 02:09:09	@PikFan	Tropical Forest on BE! has changed

2016-06-21 02:12:26	Scruffy	Wow, looks great!
2016-06-21 02:12:49	Scruffy	I love the look of the rock barriers
2016-06-21 02:12:53	@PikFan	hi
2016-06-21 02:12:59	@PikFan	wow, nice
2016-06-21 02:13:12	Marty2000	Cool!
2016-06-21 02:13:14	Scruffy	What is the object a little to the right of the center?
2016-06-21 02:13:23	@PikFan	meanwhile, I'm updating the Mission Mode world records
2016-06-21 02:13:29	CraftedPbody	the hole?
2016-06-21 02:13:33	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-21 02:13:33	CraftedPbody	That
2016-06-21 02:13:38	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-21 02:13:58	CraftedPbody	That's a hermit Crawmad's Den
2016-06-21 02:14:05	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-06-21 02:14:45	CraftedPbody	The whole pebbly chasm would be full of water and in the actual thing there would be lily pads
2016-06-21 02:15:15	Scruffy	Wow
2016-06-21 02:15:25	Scruffy	That will be awesome
2016-06-21 02:15:34	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-21 02:15:34	@PikFan	it's kinda like a zen garden
2016-06-21 02:15:34	@PikFan	almost
2016-06-21 02:16:56	CraftedPbody	Also, lily pads wouldn't be the only way to get on the island with the red bulborb. There would be a geyser near the first closest rock to Olimar on the south side
2016-06-21 02:18:37	CraftedPbody	I'm going to go back to working on it and update you guys in a while, I might pop in for suggestions so I'm going to keep this page open.
2016-06-21 02:18:58	Scruffy	Cool, thanks for showing it!
2016-06-21 02:19:21	CraftedPbody	By the way Scruffy, I love your Tropical Wilds Remix, I've been listening to it while working on this
2016-06-21 02:20:00	Scruffy	Heh, thank you
2016-06-21 02:20:38	Marty2000	Lots of new world recors, wow
2016-06-21 02:20:42	Marty2000	records*
2016-06-21 02:22:45	@PikFan	oh, are you watching the RC fill up? :P
2016-06-21 02:23:02	CraftedPbody	Oh I just thought of something... Anyone who uses the engine, has anyone made a male sheargrub?
2016-06-21 02:26:19	Scruffy	Not yet, I haven't programmed any new objects yet
2016-06-21 02:28:36	@PikFan	a few of these new world records beat the old ones by almost 1,000 points
2016-06-21 02:28:39	@PikFan	that's insane
2016-06-21 02:28:51	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-06-21 02:28:52	Scruffy	Each second gives you 30 points, right?
2016-06-21 02:29:00	@PikFan	I think so
2016-06-21 02:29:04	Scruffy	So the BE! record at 10,460
2016-06-21 02:29:20	Scruffy	means they finished with 5:45 left on the clock
2016-06-21 02:29:36	Scruffy	Tropical Forest
2016-06-21 02:29:56	Scruffy	1 MINUTE AND 15 SECONDS

2016-06-21 02:30:46	@PikFan	I bet these people have never seen sunlight
2016-06-21 02:30:54	CraftedPbody	lol
2016-06-21 02:31:17	@PikFan	kidding aside, I seriously wonder how they're able to do it
2016-06-21 02:31:24	CraftedPbody	So, I made Orange bulborbs in the engine
2016-06-21 02:31:32	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-21 02:31:52	@PikFan	do they wake up easier like actual Orange Bulborbs?
2016-06-21 02:32:05	CraftedPbody	yeah, they wake up if you get close
2016-06-21 02:32:20	@PikFan	neat
2016-06-21 02:32:20	CraftedPbody	before you touch them
2016-06-21 02:32:55	CraftedPbody	they also have a shorter area
2016-06-21 02:33:14	@PikFan	shorter...area?
2016-06-21 02:33:20	@PikFan	walking area...?
2016-06-21 02:33:39	CraftedPbody	Like where they'll chase you before they give up
2016-06-21 02:33:51	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-06-21 02:34:03	@PikFan	that's what I thought you meant, but I wasn't sure :P
2016-06-21 02:34:19	CraftedPbody	So, what should I name this area?
2016-06-21 02:34:30	@PikFan	hmm
2016-06-21 02:34:42	CraftedPbody	The placeholder name I have is "Creek"
2016-06-21 02:34:48	@PikFan	was that picture you showed us all of the area, or just part of it?
2016-06-21 02:35:09	CraftedPbody	All of what I have now, but only a part of the full area
2016-06-21 02:35:21	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-21 02:35:37	@PikFan	the water and lily pads are a big part of it, I'm guessing?
2016-06-21 02:35:52	@PikFan	kinda like Twilight River
2016-06-21 02:36:06	CraftedPbody	Yeah
2016-06-21 02:36:11	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-21 02:36:18	CraftedPbody	except more water
2016-06-21 02:36:24	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-21 02:36:34	CraftedPbody	Most of the area is water
2016-06-21 02:36:35	@PikFan	any other noteworthy bits?
2016-06-21 02:37:25	CraftedPbody	Well, there's a lot of little islands (like the one with the bulborb) scattered through the creek
2016-06-21 02:38:04	@PikFan	Bespeckled Creek
2016-06-21 02:39:21	CraftedPbody	hmm
2016-06-21 02:39:25	CraftedPbody	Maybe
2016-06-21 02:39:49	@PikFan	hmmm
2016-06-21 02:39:58	@PikFan	http://thesaurus.com
2016-06-21 02:45:04	@PikFan	done updating world records
2016-06-21 02:46:16	@PikFan	Flooded... something
2016-06-21 02:46:16	Marty2000	Nice
2016-06-21 02:46:48	@PikFan	oh, I said it looked like a zen garden earlier, so perhaps "Flooded Haven"
2016-06-21 02:47:14	@PikFan	but if there's a lot of enemies then "Haven" would be ironic
2016-06-21 02:47:57	@PikFan	Marty, how's Splatoon been treating you?
2016-06-21 02:48:05	@PikFan	since we talked about it last
2016-06-21 02:51:07	Marty2000	No disconnects
2016-06-21 02:51:15	Marty2000	Made a new account and trying to reach level 10
2016-06-21 02:51:18	@PikFan	how about lag?
2016-06-21 02:51:19	Marty2000	(for Ranked Mode)
2016-06-21 02:51:24	Marty2000	Little for now
2016-06-21 02:51:29	@PikFan	hm, alright
2016-06-21 02:56:39	CraftedPbody	So, there'll probably be a good number of enemies. The water will have a lot of Hermit Crawmads and Dumples and the occasional Skeeterskate. The area I'm about to work on : ( https://i.gyazo.com/ed19780c53eeba88de76b400fe1ec83f.png ) will be full of Male and Female Sheargrubs
2016-06-21 02:56:57	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-21 02:57:03	@PikFan	then yeah, Haven wouldn't work
2016-06-21 02:57:59	@PikFan	Flooded could still work though
2016-06-21 02:59:17	CraftedPbody	I say Dumples rather than specifically water Dumples because I also plan on having my own fanon enemy the "Electric Water Dumple" https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/MlWA77wr7y0LxaamZX
2016-06-21 02:59:42	CraftedPbody	I haven't made a page for this yet I don't think...
2016-06-21 02:59:42	@PikFan	ooh
2016-06-21 02:59:58	@PikFan	that's sure to shock things
2016-06-21 03:00:04	@PikFan	<bad pun was bad>
2016-06-21 03:00:09	@PikFan	<<wasn't even a pun>>
2016-06-21 03:00:25	CraftedPbody	It's about the size of the adult bulbmin

2016-06-21 03:05:05	Scruffy	That's a great picture, I like the little fronds it has
2016-06-21 03:06:24	CraftedPbody	Scruffy do you think you'd be up to making a the electric water dumple?
2016-06-21 03:07:01	CraftedPbody	wait why'd I put "a" in that sentence?
2016-06-21 03:07:39	@PikFan	maybe you were gonna type "an electric water dumple" but then you decided to change it to "the electric water dumple"
2016-06-21 03:07:43	@PikFan	or the other way around
2016-06-21 03:07:45	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-21 03:07:52	CraftedPbody	I think it was the first one
2016-06-21 03:08:11	Scruffy	Sure, I could do that
2016-06-21 03:08:12	CraftedPbody	I'm a derp. If I haven't ever stated this before
2016-06-21 03:08:35	@PikFan	heh, it's alright, we all have our moments

2016-06-21 13:26:47	Klemen702	guys
2016-06-21 13:26:49	Klemen702	i have a question
2016-06-21 13:26:57	Klemen702	if you were to make a superpowerful being thing
2016-06-21 13:27:02	Klemen702	imagine a ''videogame boss''
2016-06-21 13:27:13	Klemen702	would you fill it with explosives so it's death looks fancy
2016-06-21 13:27:20	Klemen702	with a chance of it dying earlier
2016-06-21 13:27:32	Klemen702	and also possibly wasting needed materials
2016-06-21 13:28:17	Marty2000	Hi Kmeen702
2016-06-21 13:28:21	Marty2000	Nice, Splatoon!
2016-06-21 13:28:23	Marty2000	Klemen702
2016-06-21 13:28:32	Marty2000	Oh, I misready
2016-06-21 13:28:39	Marty2000	misread*
2016-06-21 13:28:45	Marty2000	"I have Splatoon"
2016-06-21 13:28:52	Marty2000	No, you actually have a question
2016-06-21 13:28:56	Marty2000	Too much Splatoon :p
2016-06-21 13:29:15	Marty2000	Klemen702: my powerful being would have a Bubbler
2016-06-21 13:29:23	Marty2000	That's all
2016-06-21 13:29:26	Klemen702	bubbler?
2016-06-21 13:29:56	Marty2000	In Splatoon, a Bubbler is a special weapon that makes you invincible for 5-8 seconds and you can share it with your teammates when you activate it
2016-06-21 13:30:12	Klemen702	i instantly thought of the cave story weapon at first
2016-06-21 13:30:23	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/oI1DY0v3-OY
2016-06-21 13:32:50	Klemen702	one thing i will say
2016-06-21 13:32:55	Klemen702	since everyone here enjoys splatoon so much
2016-06-21 13:33:05	Klemen702	i made up new sentences to piss off people
2016-06-21 13:33:14	Marty2000	The only drawback is the increase knockback
2016-06-21 13:33:20	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 13:37:45	Yoshi2	splatoon
2016-06-21 13:37:46	Yoshi2	sucks
2016-06-21 13:38:04	Yoshi2	prove me wrong

2016-06-21 13:39:04	Marty2000	Yoshi2: if you want a serious answer, I'd say it can't be liked by everybody ;)
2016-06-21 13:41:11	Yoshi2	hiho CraftedPbody 
2016-06-21 13:41:21	Yoshi2	Marty2000: pretty lazy answer
2016-06-21 13:44:41	Klemen702	well
2016-06-21 13:44:44	Klemen702	splatoon is not shit
2016-06-21 13:44:51	Klemen702	it has no brown ink (MAYBE idk the game too much)
2016-06-21 13:46:40	Yoshi2	Klemen702: that doesn't convince me
2016-06-21 13:46:57	Klemen702	well
2016-06-21 13:47:05	Klemen702	what does the game suck then?
2016-06-21 13:47:49	Yoshi2	you need to prove that it doesn't suck 
2016-06-21 13:48:55	Klemen702	you haven't even said what it sucks in the first place
2016-06-21 13:49:02	Klemen702	i want to hear that information
2016-06-21 13:49:23	Yoshi2	it sucks because you are using what in a place where you should use why
2016-06-21 13:51:04	Yoshi2	also it is so annoying to glitch to outside of the starting plaza
2016-06-21 13:51:08	Yoshi2	and where are my pants
2016-06-21 13:51:12	Klemen702	oh wait
2016-06-21 13:51:16	Klemen702	you mean like
2016-06-21 13:51:19	Klemen702	''the game is bad''?
2016-06-21 13:51:48	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-21 13:52:30	Yoshi2	you said "you haven't even said what it sucks" instead of "you haven't said why it sucks"
2016-06-21 13:52:43	Yoshi2	and "what does the game suck then" instead of "why does the game suck then"
2016-06-21 13:52:44	Klemen702	i thought you meant literal sucking
2016-06-21 13:53:03	Yoshi2	suck as in the game is bad, yes
2016-06-21 13:53:27	Klemen702	k
2016-06-21 13:54:40	Yoshi2	now
2016-06-21 13:54:43	Yoshi2	prove me wrong
2016-06-21 13:54:47	Yoshi2	anyone
2016-06-21 13:55:15	Yoshi2	damnit trolling you guys is not fun if nobody responds 
2016-06-21 13:55:32	Marty2000	We can say the same for pretty much every game
2016-06-21 13:55:35	Marty2000	For example,
2016-06-21 13:55:38	Marty2000	"Battalion Wars suck"
2016-06-21 13:55:41	Marty2000	Prove me wrong ;)
2016-06-21 13:55:46	Marty2000	sucks*
2016-06-21 13:56:05	Marty2000	Or
2016-06-21 13:56:08	Marty2000	"Pikmin sucks"
2016-06-21 13:56:32	Yoshi2	battalion wars has tanks and military planes and it is sooo fun to shoot stuff
2016-06-21 13:56:40	Yoshi2	PROVED.YOU.WRONG.
2016-06-21 13:57:01	Marty2000	In Splatoon, it's so fun to shoot stuff
2016-06-21 13:57:04	Marty2000	Proved you wrong
2016-06-21 13:57:21	Yoshi2	damnit
2016-06-21 13:57:23	Yoshi2	you got me
2016-06-21 13:57:40	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-21 13:57:45	Yoshi2	(actually I do have splatoon and yes it is a great game)
2016-06-21 13:57:50	Klemen702	you still haven't proved why pikmin doesn't suck
2016-06-21 13:58:04	Marty2000	In Pikmin, it's so fun to throw Pikmin at creatures
2016-06-21 13:58:13	Klemen702	ooooh snap
2016-06-21 13:58:13	Marty2000	Proved myself wrong
2016-06-21 13:59:00	Klemen702	now i want to see if you guys can prove why EA doesn't suck
2016-06-21 13:59:44	Marty2000	Hmm... I don't play FIFA, but it's so fun to shoot players with the ball
2016-06-21 13:59:49	Marty2000	Proved you wrong ;)
2016-06-21 13:59:50	Yoshi2	BF1 looks cool
2016-06-21 13:59:57	Klemen702	wow
2016-06-21 14:00:00	Klemen702	how could you have done it
2016-06-21 14:00:05	Yoshi2	world war 1
2016-06-21 14:00:34	Marty2000	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce 
2016-06-21 14:01:41	Marty2000	Klemen702: "Men played games of football with one another, giving one of the most memorable images of the truce." (in case you didn't understand Yoshi2's statement"
2016-06-21 14:01:46	Marty2000	)*
2016-06-21 14:01:59	Klemen702	alright
2016-06-21 14:03:43	Yoshi2	Marty2000: i don't understand your statement or why you replied with that 
2016-06-21 14:04:05	Marty2000	because you said "world war 1"
2016-06-21 14:05:38	Yoshi2	Marty2000: but why the christmas truce
2016-06-21 14:05:47	Yoshi2	BF1 is world war 1-themed
2016-06-21 14:06:21	Marty2000	 "was a series of widespread but unofficial ceasefires along the Western Front around Christmas 1914." I had said "I don't play FIFA, but it's so fun to shoot players with the ball" beforehand
2016-06-21 14:06:32	Marty2000	And since you said "world war 1"
2016-06-21 14:06:36	Marty2000	This reminded me of that

2016-06-21 15:09:22	Marty2000	Ok, I have been studying weird stuff for Espyo in Pikmin (1) about the enemy variation, I think I know pretty much in what cases it triggers or not, I have still a few things to try and then I'll be done
2016-06-21 15:14:21	Yoshi2	neat, would you be willing to study some stuff for me in BW? :v)

2016-06-21 15:20:22	Klemen702	CraftedPbody how finished is that thing
2016-06-21 15:20:27	Klemen702	oh
2016-06-21 15:20:29	Klemen702	he gone
2016-06-21 15:20:29	Klemen702	rip
2016-06-21 15:21:40	Marty2000	Nectar (when spawning; can disappear)
2016-06-21 15:24:15	Marty2000	Honeywisp (Pikmin thrown at it)
2016-06-21 15:24:37	Yoshi2	it's very repetitive and a bit boring/mind numbing so I won't blame you if you decide against it, but if you ever feel like "man, figuring stuff out in pikmin really is not enough for me, i need something else to do too!", I could think up some stuff that would profit from some investigation :P
2016-06-21 15:25:19	Yoshi2	(mostly changing values, especially flag values)
2016-06-21 15:25:55	Marty2000	Well, I'll help you, worry not. I just have to decided when because I have lots of thing to do with Pikmin. First, I'll look for a BW iso, and then I'll tell you  when I can try ;) Probably during July
2016-06-21 15:26:10	Marty2000	Immature Pellet Posies (when attacked ; can disappear)
2016-06-21 15:26:20	Klemen702	if he ever does think that it would put shame on me for not doing anything
2016-06-21 15:26:36	Klemen702	forgot a , there
2016-06-21 15:27:07	Yoshi2	BW iso will be the easiest part
2016-06-21 15:27:22	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 15:27:25	Yoshi2	(unless you are talking about the Japanese version which I swear I can't find anywhere)
2016-06-21 15:28:22	Marty2000	Oh, really?
2016-06-21 15:28:56	Marty2000	Mature Pellet Posies (Forest Navel ; when attacked ; can disappear)
2016-06-21 15:29:14	Yoshi2	I haven't looked for the Japanese version of the gamecube game, but I've looked all over the place for the Japanese version of the Wii game
2016-06-21 15:29:23	Yoshi2	one torrent I found is stuck at 97% forever <.<
2016-06-21 15:30:07	Marty2000	I see :'
2016-06-21 15:30:08	Marty2000	:(
2016-06-21 15:32:10	Marty2000	Semi Mature Pellet Posies (when approaching)
2016-06-21 15:32:21	Marty2000	That's is INCREDIBLY WEIRD AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
2016-06-21 15:32:29	Marty2000	That is*
2016-06-21 15:33:34	Yoshi2	what is incredibly weird?
2016-06-21 15:33:56	Marty2000	Depending on the stage of the Pellet Posy, the location of the Pellet Posy, and what you do, the enemy variation will trigger or not :p
2016-06-21 15:34:10	Marty2000	A non mature Pellet Posy (stage 1) will simply trigger the music when attacked
2016-06-21 15:34:25	Marty2000	A semi mature -stage 2) one will trigger the music when approached
2016-06-21 15:34:52	Marty2000	A mature Pellet Posy (final stage) will either trigger the enemy variation when approached, or when attacked
2016-06-21 15:35:14	Marty2000	(so, here, it depends on the area)
2016-06-21 15:40:11	Marty2000	... maybe the semi-mature plant (so, when it's growing until it blossoms) is considered as an attack, which would explain why the enemy variation of the music trigger
2016-06-21 15:40:13	Marty2000	triggers
2016-06-21 15:44:52	Marty2000	:(
2016-06-21 15:44:54	Marty2000	I said:
2016-06-21 15:45:02	Marty2000	"A semi mature one will trigger the music when approached"
2016-06-21 15:45:16	Marty2000	Yeah, except for the one near the Red Onion on the Forest of Hope
2016-06-21 15:45:19	Yoshi2	ah, you are talking about music
2016-06-21 15:45:26	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 15:45:59	Yoshi2	the music in pikmin is weird and I can't wait for scruffy to do more stuff with it
2016-06-21 15:46:19	Marty2000	"A mature Pellet Posy (final stage) will either trigger the enemy variation when approached, or when attacked" (you have to attack it on the Forest Navel/approach it on the Forest of Hope)
2016-06-21 15:46:37	Marty2000	I think I can understand why, but I am not sure at all
2016-06-21 15:46:46	Marty2000	Some plants do not change their pellet's colour
2016-06-21 15:46:53	Marty2000	Yeah, that's true
2016-06-21 15:47:31	Marty2000	But it's really constant in P3, in P2 too (even though I am holding a mystery that I will release when I see it's time too :p ) but P1 doesn't make sense
2016-06-21 15:48:51	Yoshi2	P3 only uses streamed music (think mp3, ogg, wav), P1's and P2's music is sequenced (think midi)
2016-06-21 15:49:34	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 15:50:15	Marty2000	"A semi mature one will trigger the music when approached" (except if it used to hold a single pellet colour in the past)
2016-06-21 15:52:41	Yoshi2	will you write down those findings somewhere?
2016-06-21 15:52:54	Yoshi2	a bit difficult to keep track of those on irc
2016-06-21 15:53:33	Marty2000	Well, yeah, once I have finished, I'll reread the chat and put them somewhere
2016-06-21 15:53:50	Marty2000	I'm just quite impatient to find new myseries :p
2016-06-21 15:55:30	Marty2000	"A mature Pellet Posy (final stage) will either trigger the enemy variation when approached, or when attacked." If it triggers it when approached, and it is then attacked, it will only trigger the music again when re-attacked if the player goes far away
2016-06-21 15:55:40	Marty2000	That's getting complicated...
2016-06-21 15:56:24	Marty2000	Does BW have such non-sense concerning its musics? :D
2016-06-21 15:58:12	Marty2000	"A mature Pellet Posy (final stage) will either trigger the enemy variation when approached, or when attacked." (needs to be attacked on the Forest Navel and Impact Site, needs to be approached in the Forest of Hope)
2016-06-21 15:59:40	Yoshi2	BW has different nonsense
2016-06-21 15:59:58	Yoshi2	why is replacing music with longer music so difficult
2016-06-21 16:00:39	Yoshi2	and why is the music only 32k hz in BW1 and a whooping 24k hz in BWii
2016-06-21 16:00:54	Yoshi2	why is the music in BWii sampled at a lower rate
2016-06-21 16:01:04	Yoshi2	it sounds horrible compared to 32k hz
2016-06-21 16:01:31	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 16:01:54	Marty2000	Ok, I'll write everything on my userpage
2016-06-21 16:16:55	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty#Music_in_Pikmin:_oddities More organised :)
2016-06-21 16:21:05	Marty2000	Discovered an invisible plant in the FInal Trial that makes flying insects appear when touched

2016-06-21 16:44:17	Scruffy	Hi Marty!
2016-06-21 16:44:23	Scruffy	Those are some interesting oddities
2016-06-21 16:44:47	Scruffy	In the enemy-variant music of /Pikmin/
2016-06-21 16:44:48	Yoshi2	hiho Scruffy 
2016-06-21 16:44:53	Scruffy	Hi Yoshi2!
2016-06-21 16:46:22	Yoshi2	figuring out how the sound in pikmin works will be useful
2016-06-21 16:50:14	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-21 16:50:19	Marty2000	Ah, yeah
2016-06-21 16:50:31	Marty2000	It's very odd, I'm currently testing what triggers it
2016-06-21 16:55:29	Marty2000	Hmm, I also wonder if those oddities were corrected for the NPC! version. I think it's a glitch, since it doesn't happen anymore in P2
2016-06-21 16:56:09	Scruffy	Probably not
2016-06-21 16:56:38	Scruffy	The objects you described (Pellet posies, candypop buds, geysers) are all considered enemies and listed in the folder that handles enemies
2016-06-21 16:56:51	Marty2000	Yeah, I know
2016-06-21 16:57:10	Marty2000	But it's quite strange to see that they trigger the variant or not depending on what the player does
2016-06-21 16:57:19	Scruffy	I suppose they just wanted one big folder for objects with animations that are not Pikmin or carrying items
2016-06-21 16:57:28	Scruffy	True
2016-06-21 16:57:31	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-21 16:58:05	Scruffy	Perhaps it's based on animation?
2016-06-21 16:58:27	Scruffy	I mean, perhaps there's a particular parameter along with each animation that specifically triggers the theme
2016-06-21 16:58:34	Scruffy	Not just the presence of an enemy itself
2016-06-21 16:59:18	Scruffy	But that wouldn't make sense unless they wanted Pellet posies and nectar to seem dangerous
2016-06-21 17:00:02	Marty2000	Or maybe it's considered as an attack? (the music changes when the Pellet Posy evolves)
2016-06-21 17:00:11	Scruffy	Perhaps
2016-06-21 17:00:33	Scruffy	If only we could make sense of the enemy files
2016-06-21 17:00:47	Scruffy	I can't even open them, they aren't in a recognizable format
2016-06-21 17:01:46	Marty2000	I see :/
2016-06-21 17:05:04	Scruffy	Perhaps, since they considered this folder would hold all enemies, they designed a parameter that caused the enemy variant /not/ to play on a particular animation
2016-06-21 17:05:09	Scruffy	And... didn't think they would need it?
2016-06-21 17:05:20	Scruffy	Since all enemies would be dangerous
2016-06-21 17:05:43	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 17:05:56	Scruffy	But putting Pellet Posies in the same folder, they did set its idle animation to "not dangerous"
2016-06-21 17:06:35	Scruffy	But perhaps left its growing animation "dangerous," either because it was forgotten or because the player doesn't expect it to happen and they want the music to help alert the player to it
2016-06-21 17:07:34	Marty2000	Possible. We should also note that the variant does not trigger if the player does not see the animation on screen
2016-06-21 17:07:46	Marty2000	It only triggers if you see it
2016-06-21 17:07:56	Marty2000	(And when you approach it again)
2016-06-21 17:08:23	Marty2000	However, if you go far away from the Pellet Posy (and for a long time), the variant won't trigger again when approaching
2016-06-21 17:08:36	Marty2000	When I mean "for a long time", it's a few minutes
2016-06-21 17:09:50	Marty2000	Also, I'm holding a "mystery" for Pikmin 2's music (another secret variant) that I haven't seen on Pikipedia. I will let you guys now when I have understood how it works
2016-06-21 17:10:07	Scruffy	What is it?
2016-06-21 17:10:36	Marty2000	When Pikmin die above ground, it can change the variation if you follow certain steps (I think)
2016-06-21 17:10:45	Scruffy	Oh, yes
2016-06-21 17:10:49	Scruffy	That can happen with any music
2016-06-21 17:10:55	Marty2000	Oh, so you know it
2016-06-21 17:10:57	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 17:11:20	Scruffy	I think it's trivia on the music page, but I can't remember how much I elaborated
2016-06-21 17:11:25	Scruffy	I'll go into more detail
2016-06-21 17:11:34	Marty2000	I observed that not so long ago, that's surprising, because it disappears if you have a lot of Pikmin with you
2016-06-21 17:11:50	Marty2000	And it reappears if all of your Pikmin get back into their Onions again
2016-06-21 17:12:14	Scruffy	If you have more than 10 Pikmin out, and lose enough that the number falls under 10, certain notes of the melody will be cut out
2016-06-21 17:12:23	Scruffy	This happens above and under the ground
2016-06-21 17:12:45	Scruffy	Once it happens one time (per day), it will continue to happen as long as there are fewer than 10 Pikmin in the field
2016-06-21 17:13:00	CraftedPbody	Update : ( https://i.gyazo.com/18bd10116cdcea556c44f59fb5c780e2.jpg )
2016-06-21 17:13:29	Scruffy	There is one file per music track in the game that handles this with a matrix of notes to cut from the song
2016-06-21 17:13:49	Scruffy	And it only effects main melodic instruments
2016-06-21 17:13:54	Marty2000	oh, I see
2016-06-21 17:14:03	Scruffy	Including extra instruments when you are carrying a treasure 
2016-06-21 17:14:23	Scruffy	It's really extra detail that would be difficult to notice
2016-06-21 17:14:30	Scruffy	But that's what Pikmin 2 is all about
2016-06-21 17:14:42	Marty2000	Yeah, it's nice you've noticed them, though ;)
2016-06-21 17:14:50	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-21 17:15:01	Scruffy	I've studied the music in the Pikmin series so much
2016-06-21 17:15:06	Scruffy	It's such a great soundtrack
2016-06-21 17:15:18	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-06-21 17:15:20	Scruffy	Also great job CraftedPBody! Love the sump

2016-06-21 19:11:40	@Espyo	I can't wait to see it in action
2016-06-21 19:12:52	CraftedPbody	So, how hard/easy would lily pads be to make?
2016-06-21 19:13:07	@Espyo	very hard, I'm afraid...
2016-06-21 19:13:21	CraftedPbody	dang...
2016-06-21 19:13:22	@Espyo	yeah, I noticed those leafs, and though you were planning those to be like lily pad bays
2016-06-21 19:13:27	@Espyo	afraid to say that won't really be a thing
2016-06-21 19:13:33	@Espyo	maaaaaaaybe one day in the future
2016-06-21 19:13:42	@Espyo	there're kinda two parts to it
2016-06-21 19:13:45	CraftedPbody	How about geysers?
2016-06-21 19:13:53	@Espyo	first, the actual part of getting an object to carry another object on top of it
2016-06-21 19:14:00	@Espyo	secondly, the whole auto-mount and auto-dismount
2016-06-21 19:14:03	@Espyo	geysers are planned
2016-06-21 19:14:09	@Espyo	not quite sure how I'll make them yet, but they can't be THAT hard
2016-06-21 19:14:16	CraftedPbody	ok
2016-06-21 19:14:20	CraftedPbody	well that's good
2016-06-21 19:14:23	@Espyo	actually, come to think of it
2016-06-21 19:14:28	@Espyo	geysers are probably very easy to implement
2016-06-21 19:14:44	CraftedPbody	I planned for geysers to also be a way onto the little islands
2016-06-21 19:14:59	@Espyo	right
2016-06-21 19:15:00	@Espyo	that'll work well
2016-06-21 19:15:12	@Espyo	they might be a bit tough for designers t oadd
2016-06-21 19:15:14	@Espyo	*to add
2016-06-21 19:15:22	@Espyo	since the way I'm planning involves having you have to work out the strength and angle
2016-06-21 19:15:26	@Espyo	angle is easy, just point to wherever
2016-06-21 19:15:32	@Espyo	but the strength might be trickier
2016-06-21 19:15:41	@Espyo	still, nothing that's can't be done with a bit of trial-and-error
2016-06-21 19:15:53	@Espyo	plus geyser throws don't have to be very precise
2016-06-21 19:16:07	@Espyo	so long as you land on top of a platform, it doesn't matter if you got shot really high or just high enough, does it?

2016-06-21 19:16:44	CraftedPbody	couldn't you just have it set to where the person just has to set the coord of where it sends you?
2016-06-21 19:17:52	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-06-21 19:17:59	@Espyo	well, it could be tricky
2016-06-21 19:18:14	@Espyo	but maybe not
2016-06-21 19:18:23	@Espyo	actually, I'm starting to get ideas
2016-06-21 19:18:25	@Espyo	yeah, that might work
2016-06-21 19:18:27	@Espyo	nice idea!
2016-06-21 19:18:31	@Espyo	I'll note it down
2016-06-21 19:18:54	CraftedPbody	Because it'd be easy to find out the coords since it's displayed in the bottom left.
2016-06-21 19:19:17	@Espyo	oh, I was thinking something even better
2016-06-21 19:19:24	@Espyo	you place down a new object, like a marker
2016-06-21 19:19:27	@Espyo	and then "connect" the geyser to the marker
2016-06-21 19:19:35	@Espyo	and the engine automatically figures out how to throw it for you
2016-06-21 19:19:36	CraftedPbody	ah
2016-06-21 19:20:42	@Espyo	and I could reuse this "connect" mechanic for so many other things...
2016-06-21 19:20:49	@Espyo	and it'd probably be very easy to add to the editor
2016-06-21 19:20:54	@Espyo	oh, don't know if I told you
2016-06-21 19:20:59	@Espyo	or if you've seen the changes on github
2016-06-21 19:21:02	@Espyo	but I made it so you can now DRAW sectors
2016-06-21 19:21:11	CraftedPbody	how?
2016-06-21 19:21:12	@Espyo	instead of plopping a square one and having to sculpt it by hand
2016-06-21 19:21:18	@Espyo	you draw it line by line
2016-06-21 19:21:23	@Espyo	start anywhere, and then just draw
2016-06-21 19:22:06	Yoshi2	can I stop mid-drawing?
2016-06-21 19:22:33	Yoshi2	drawing something in one go seems a bit tedious
2016-06-21 19:22:42	@Espyo	I made sure that you very much CAN'T do that
2016-06-21 19:22:44	@Espyo	that would unleash
2016-06-21 19:22:47	@Espyo	at least three types of hell
2016-06-21 19:22:49	@Espyo	like
2016-06-21 19:22:50	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-21 19:22:54	@Espyo	imagine a polygon that's not closed
2016-06-21 19:22:56	@Espyo	imagine the hell
2016-06-21 19:23:12	Yoshi2	so I have to draw it in one go
2016-06-21 19:23:15	@Espyo	I guess it'll be tedious for long sectors, but you can split it into multiple ones
2016-06-21 19:23:19	 *	Yoshi2 shudders a bit
2016-06-21 19:23:25	CraftedPbody	you'll unleash at least 3 bolberts
2016-06-21 19:23:29	@Espyo	at least
2016-06-21 19:23:42	Yoshi2	is it possible to extend an existing sector or carve into an existing sector that you have drawn?
2016-06-21 19:23:46	@Espyo	there likely won't be many long sectors on a well-made map at least
2016-06-21 19:23:53	@Espyo	oh, yeah, you can edit existing sectors
2016-06-21 19:23:59	@Espyo	only the initial creation of a sector changed
2016-06-21 19:24:10	@Espyo	where it used to be a square automatically created and you'd have to mold it yourself
2016-06-21 19:24:15	@Espyo	now, you can draw the initial shape at will
2016-06-21 19:24:18	@Espyo	and still mould it
2016-06-21 19:24:52	CraftedPbody	So will warps like in pikmin 3 be possible in any way?
2016-06-21 19:26:36	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-21 19:26:42	@Espyo	hm, I should add it to the list of things to do
2016-06-21 19:26:56	@Espyo	they might be a little limited, though
2016-06-21 19:27:08	@Espyo	like, you might need to draw a straight line between the two points for the carrying path
2016-06-21 19:27:25	@Espyo	because the Pikmin will expect to go to the other path's stop, and cross through the warp point in the way
2016-06-21 19:27:34	@Espyo	if there's a path stop between the warp points...
2016-06-21 19:27:49	@Espyo	the Pikmin will go from one warp point to the other, and face back, because the "next" point in the path is behind
2016-06-21 19:27:56	@Espyo	and it'll keep going back and forth trying to reach the point in the middle
2016-06-21 19:28:07	@Espyo	and I won't have any decent way of making that not a problem
2016-06-21 19:28:11	@Espyo	so it'll have to be a limitation
2016-06-21 19:28:14	@Espyo	shouldn't be that hard, anyway
2016-06-21 19:28:28	@Espyo	the two sections of the map can be any length apart, as long as there's a line between the two points
2016-06-21 19:29:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-21 19:29:03	@Espyo	basically, right now
2016-06-21 19:29:09	@Espyo	I'm done with developments for the next version
2016-06-21 19:29:12	@Espyo	I'm more or less just adding content
2016-06-21 19:29:16	@Espyo	enemies, pre-packaged hazards, etc.
2016-06-21 19:29:25	CraftedPbody	What enemies?
2016-06-21 19:29:36	@Espyo	still not sure yet :/
2016-06-21 19:29:40	@Espyo	they have to make use of hazards
2016-06-21 19:29:47	@Espyo	my plan is to make completely new ones, from scratch
2016-06-21 19:29:49	@Espyo	not based on any canon enemy
2016-06-21 19:30:02	CraftedPbody	You should put one of my fanon enemies
2016-06-21 19:30:15	CraftedPbody	I have two hazard based fanon enemies
2016-06-21 19:30:22	@Espyo	I can do that
2016-06-21 19:30:24	@Espyo	how original are they?
2016-06-21 19:30:37	@Espyo	not that I'm judging :|
2016-06-21 19:31:10	CraftedPbody	Well... One is the Sudoric Bulblax, and the other is the Electric Water Dumple
2016-06-21 19:31:19	Yoshi2	to this day I am waiting on an original level from UltraMario ( °▽ °)
2016-06-21 19:32:22	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-21 19:32:32	@Espyo	I can add some not-original-but-new enemies
2016-06-21 19:32:39	@Espyo	but I really want to make something completely custom, too
2016-06-21 19:33:00	CraftedPbody	You may have seen the sudoric bulblax, but I'm not sure if you've seen the electric water dumple or not
2016-06-21 19:33:43	Marty2000	Ideas: make something similar to the unused enemies from P3...?
2016-06-21 19:34:17	CraftedPbody	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/MlWA77wr7y0LxaamZX
2016-06-21 19:35:20	CraftedPbody	That was made almost a full year ago... Wow... didn't think it was that long
2016-06-21 19:35:51	@Espyo	Marty2000: yeah, I could do that too
2016-06-21 19:35:54	@Espyo	I want to, one day
2016-06-21 19:36:03	@Espyo	ah, I've seen that
2016-06-21 19:36:11	@Espyo	yeah... I wouldn't think it's been a year either
2016-06-21 19:36:44	CraftedPbody	July 5th was when I made it
2016-06-21 19:40:21	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-21 19:47:32	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/fc1e521d02ffd5dd301fcbad15e1cf5f.png
2016-06-21 19:47:55	@Espyo	hey, those dirt ledges are a nice idea
2016-06-21 19:48:25	CraftedPbody	I was looking at pikmin 3 screenshots and they do that alot.
2016-06-21 19:50:09	@Espyo	hmm, now that you mention it, yeah
2016-06-21 19:50:23	@Espyo	I can imagine it becoming a bit boring to do after a while...
2016-06-21 19:50:30	@Espyo	I don't have any good way of speeding up the process
2016-06-21 19:50:37	@Espyo	thankfully, it being a bit boring to make is the only problem
2016-06-21 19:50:58	@Espyo	the fact that there's an extra sector, and that the engine has to do more smoothing operations between textures and all that doesn't matter
2016-06-21 19:51:07	@Espyo	so no performance penalty for making your area pretty with that
2016-06-21 19:52:11	CraftedPbody	How easy would you say it would be for someone to make a male sheargrub? I'm trying to think of how to do it
2016-06-21 19:53:19	@Espyo	well, the whole purpose is for anybody to add content to the engine, not me
2016-06-21 19:53:26	@Espyo	so I did make everything with ease in mind
2016-06-21 19:53:36	@Espyo	that said... you can base yourself on the Female Sheargrub
2016-06-21 19:53:48	@Espyo	to get the graphics, the best way would be to do them on Inkscape, so that the art style fits
2016-06-21 19:53:55	@Espyo	since the Male Sheargrub is more than just a recolored Female
2016-06-21 19:54:03	CraftedPbody	Can it be converted to be able to attack?
2016-06-21 19:54:11	@Espyo	other than that, you'd have to change its script to make it attack
2016-06-21 19:54:15	@Espyo	which isn't very hard
2016-06-21 19:54:30	@Espyo	it's a bit daunting, especially since you'll be starting on the existing Sheargrub script, which is like 100 lines long
2016-06-21 19:54:42	@Espyo	but after understanding the concept and understanding what the Female Sheargrub is doing, it should be very easy
2016-06-21 19:54:55	@Espyo	same for any enemy, really
2016-06-21 19:55:17	@Espyo	basically... you'd have to add script logic to make it lunge when it gets close to a leader or Pikmin
2016-06-21 19:55:34	@Espyo	then, if it missed, continue, or if it grabbed something, to do the biting and swallowing animation
2016-06-21 19:55:38	@Espyo	and that would be it, really
2016-06-21 19:55:41	@Espyo	everything else is the same logic
2016-06-21 19:55:45	@Espyo	as the FS
2016-06-21 19:56:14	CraftedPbody	Would it be possible to make a dwarf bulborb not roam around?
2016-06-21 19:56:47	@Espyo	sure
2016-06-21 19:56:54	CraftedPbody	How
2016-06-21 19:57:05	@Espyo	its logic is like "sniff the ground, walk randomly, repeat"
2016-06-21 19:57:24	@Espyo	so at the state where it's sniffing, when it decides it should start exploring, just remove that
2016-06-21 19:57:32	@Espyo	let it jump into the sniffing state again
2016-06-21 19:57:37	@Espyo	and it just stays stuck sniffing in spot forever
2016-06-21 19:58:38	CraftedPbody	hmm
2016-06-21 19:59:35	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Cave_of_Pain&curid=311&diff=167480&oldid=158920
2016-06-21 19:59:37	@Espyo	Marty's Cave
2016-06-21 19:59:57	@Espyo	never really seen the word "martyrdom" before
2016-06-21 20:00:51	Marty2000	I think it exists
2016-06-21 20:00:54	Marty2000	for "Martyre"
2016-06-21 20:01:12	Marty2000	Yes, what a coincidence :p
2016-06-21 20:02:05	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Jigsaw_Colosseum&curid=15762&diff=167519&oldid=167517 add this to the Seed article
2016-06-21 20:02:44	Marty2000	Oh, yeah, you're right
2016-06-21 20:04:36	@Espyo	also apparently Twisted Cavern and Corroded Maze, too
2016-06-21 20:04:55	Marty2000	Though
2016-06-21 20:04:59	Marty2000	"There's a chance that the Onion will produce White Pikmin seeds."
2016-06-21 20:05:07	Marty2000	It's not a chance, it's always with +5
2016-06-21 20:05:32	Marty2000	+5 produces rare Pikmin, and rare Pikmin, in Bingo Battle, are the Pikmin you find planted in the level
2016-06-21 20:05:37	@Espyo	in this level, yeah, I guess
2016-06-21 20:05:39	CraftedPbody	"+5" is +5 special
2016-06-21 20:05:45	@Espyo	but what about Twisted Cavern?
2016-06-21 20:05:48	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 20:05:49	@Espyo	I think it has buried Rocks and Whites
2016-06-21 20:05:53	@Espyo	so it could be either one
2016-06-21 20:06:00	@Espyo	anyway, I cleaned up the intro paragraph
2016-06-21 20:06:04	@Espyo	it was really sketchy
2016-06-21 20:06:06	Marty2000	You can only find a species in a Bingo Battle level
2016-06-21 20:06:14	Marty2000	You start with one, and you find only another one
2016-06-21 20:06:17	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-21 20:06:20	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-21 20:06:27	Marty2000	In Twisted Cavern, you can find White Pikmin
2016-06-21 20:06:28	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User:Marty by Marty (+58 m /* Others */) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=20426&diff=167535
2016-06-21 20:06:30	@Espyo	our Twisted Cavern article doesn't explain what Pikmin you get in what layouts
2016-06-21 20:06:37	@Espyo	in fact, neither does Jigsaw Colosseum
2016-06-21 20:06:40	@Espyo	and I bet others don't either...
2016-06-21 20:06:46	Marty2000	Yeah, I have to add them
2016-06-21 20:06:58	Marty2000	I've tried to clean up an article today, by the way
2016-06-21 20:07:04	Marty2000	(on a Bingo Battle level)
2016-06-21 20:07:10	CraftedPbody	Also, there's not always a specific amount of enemies in each layout.
2016-06-21 20:07:39	CraftedPbody	For example the buried pond can have a random number of puckering blinnow
2016-06-21 20:07:52	@Espyo	but does each layout always have the same number?
2016-06-21 20:08:01	@Espyo	like, for instance, A always has 2, B always has 4, C always has 5?
2016-06-21 20:08:01	CraftedPbody	no
2016-06-21 20:08:05	@Espyo	damn :|
2016-06-21 20:08:11	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-06-21 20:08:15	Marty2000	Same number of?
2016-06-21 20:08:18	Marty2000	Pikmin?
2016-06-21 20:08:24	CraftedPbody	Some enemies are randomized
2016-06-21 20:08:28	@Espyo	of Blinnows; I was talking to CraftedPbody
2016-06-21 20:08:35	Marty2000	Oh, sorry
2016-06-21 20:08:40	Marty2000	Well, yeah, it depends
2016-06-21 20:08:57	Marty2000	Even though some enemies always have the same number, if I recall
2016-06-21 20:08:59	@Espyo	hm, I'll take a look at the game's files one day
2016-06-21 20:09:05	CraftedPbody	yeah
2016-06-21 20:09:37	CraftedPbody	Like the arid metropolis will always have the two bulbears on the layout with bulbears
2016-06-21 20:09:46	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-21 20:10:01	Marty2000	Also, Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty#Music_in_Pikmin:_oddities
2016-06-21 20:10:11	Marty2000	I have to check with the Wii version, but that's just... heh
2016-06-21 20:10:16	Marty2000	No comment on that.

2016-06-21 20:11:38	@Espyo	this game...
2016-06-21 20:15:00	CraftedPbody	Any suggestions on what to put here? ( https://i.gyazo.com/d566f579e1f9eee48bb6f8f066131901.png )
2016-06-21 20:15:56	@Espyo	>When boulders break against a wall, they trigger the enemy variation (only for a few seconds) 
2016-06-21 20:16:02	@Espyo	what if they slam against Olimar while he's lying down?
2016-06-21 20:16:16	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-21 20:16:20	@Espyo	a Burgeoning Spiderwort?
2016-06-21 20:17:24	Marty2000	They do, Espyo
2016-06-21 20:17:30	Marty2000	Same when broken with a punch
2016-06-21 20:17:34	@Espyo	may want to add that too
2016-06-21 20:17:39	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-21 20:17:53	@Espyo	looks like it's simply when they break, then
2016-06-21 20:17:59	@Espyo	regardless of how they broke
2016-06-21 20:18:40	Marty2000	No, because they trigger the variation when rolling on Olimar (even though they're not broken... yet)
2016-06-21 20:19:44	@Espyo	hm, I see
2016-06-21 20:19:48	Marty2000	Anyway, I'll try on Wii in a few minutes
2016-06-21 20:19:52	UltraMario	<Yoshi2> to this day I am waiting on an original level from UltraMario ( °▽ °)
2016-06-21 20:19:59	UltraMario	I'VE GIVEN YOU 2 ORIGINAL LEVELS
2016-06-21 20:20:02	UltraMario	ISNT THAT ENOUGH
2016-06-21 20:20:03	UltraMario	;-;
2016-06-21 20:20:03	Marty2000	Although I think nothing was patched
2016-06-21 20:20:16	@Espyo	dumb question, but are you sure you're not mixing up the music change with the fact that being near the ACB changes the music?
2016-06-21 20:20:22	Yoshi2	UltraMario: when
2016-06-21 20:20:32	UltraMario	AGES AGO
2016-06-21 20:20:36	UltraMario	;-;
2016-06-21 20:20:49	Marty2000	No, it really is the enemy variant
2016-06-21 20:20:52	Yoshi2	hole in the wall and superman? :I
2016-06-21 20:20:59	@Espyo	yeah, but I mean
2016-06-21 20:21:11	UltraMario	well
2016-06-21 20:21:14	@Espyo	are you sure it's playing because of the rock breaking or running over Olimar, and not because of the Armored Cannon Beetle being nearby?
2016-06-21 20:21:15	UltraMario	p switch block maze
2016-06-21 20:21:16	UltraMario	yeah

2016-06-21 20:21:50	Yoshi2	you then went on to make a bazillion more remakes
2016-06-21 20:21:59	Marty2000	Yes, I'm sure (you can make the rock go past the gate and still hear the enemy variant when it rolls on Olimar)
2016-06-21 20:22:26	Marty2000	(this is also how you can find out that it does not damage enemies)
2016-06-21 20:22:34	UltraMario	:^)
2016-06-21 20:22:50	@Espyo	all right, nice
2016-06-21 20:23:34	@Espyo	oh, I also implemented auto-backups yesterday
2016-06-21 20:23:44	@Espyo	meaning that if you somehow blow it so hard that you can't undo what you did
2016-06-21 20:23:48	@Espyo	or if the engine crashes
2016-06-21 20:23:51	@Espyo	you won't lose much of  your progress

2016-06-21 20:28:49	@Espyo	 67 grams?
2016-06-21 20:29:03	@Espyo	a jar of honey, that can easily weigh more than a kilogram, is said to weigh 67 grams?
2016-06-21 20:29:07	@Espyo	what am I missing here?
2016-06-21 20:30:23	Yoshi2	if the texture says so, then it's true
2016-06-21 20:31:20	@Espyo	are grams over there worth 20?
2016-06-21 20:32:17	Yoshi2	it's an empty
2016-06-21 20:32:18	Yoshi2	plastic
2016-06-21 20:32:20	Yoshi2	jar
2016-06-21 20:32:40	Marty2000	Yeah, but "67" was written when it was full :p
2016-06-21 20:33:19	@Espyo	what would be the point of writing down its weight while empty?
2016-06-21 20:33:26	@Espyo	is that normal in Germany?
2016-06-21 20:34:19	Yoshi2	no
2016-06-21 20:34:21	Yoshi2	it isn't
2016-06-21 20:34:35	Yoshi2	and 67 gram is pretty light
2016-06-21 20:35:17	Marty2000	[[Mistake]]
2016-06-21 20:35:18	Testyo	"Mistake" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Mistake
2016-06-21 20:35:25	@Espyo	yeah, 67 is really light
2016-06-21 20:35:31	Marty2000	Could fit here, then
2016-06-21 20:35:32	@Espyo	that's why I'm wondering where it came from
2016-06-21 20:35:37	Marty2000	Yeah, that's odd...
2016-06-21 20:35:42	@Espyo	even if it's like the weight of the lid, it's still not enough
2016-06-21 20:35:54	Yoshi2	Brought to you by the same people who made a tank turret model with 14 on one side and 144 on the other side
2016-06-21 20:36:06	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-21 20:36:09	@Espyo	you got a point
2016-06-21 20:36:18	@Espyo	hm, but there's gotta be some logic to this
2016-06-21 20:36:25	@Espyo	 67 grams of honey per centimeter cubed?
2016-06-21 20:36:33	@Espyo	wait...
2016-06-21 20:36:36	@Espyo	that image of real-life honey
2016-06-21 20:36:41	@Espyo	it says 500g on it
2016-06-21 20:36:41	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Honey.jpg This was the closest jar honey I could find
2016-06-21 20:36:47	Marty2000	Heh, you were faster
2016-06-21 20:36:54	@Espyo	and the version before it also says 500g
2016-06-21 20:37:02	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-06-21 20:37:12	@Espyo	let me check some of the jars I own
2016-06-21 20:39:11	@Espyo	one of mine says 500g too
2016-06-21 20:39:15	@Espyo	(well, 0,5kg)
2016-06-21 20:39:27	@Espyo	it's almost empty, and it weighs around 400g, though
2016-06-21 20:39:37	@Espyo	so the 500g might be in honey alone, not honey + jar
2016-06-21 20:39:41	@Espyo	either way, it would NEVER be sixty grams
2016-06-21 20:39:45	@Espyo	 670 grams? maybe
2016-06-21 20:39:56	Marty2000	Hmm, wait... look at that
2016-06-21 20:40:00	Marty2000	It may be a mistake, but
2016-06-21 20:40:07	@Espyo	but that clearly says 67, and it's not even because the texture is poorly mapped and the 0 is hidden from the model or anything
2016-06-21 20:40:10	@Espyo	the texture itself says 67 too
2016-06-21 20:40:14	@Espyo	yeah, I'd definitely say this is a mistake
2016-06-21 20:40:18	Yoshi2	apparently 67 g is the weight of those small packages of stuff you use to make e.g. sauce
2016-06-21 20:40:18	Marty2000	(checking something)
2016-06-21 20:40:37	@Espyo	we COULD say that the Pikmin planet uses different measuring units
2016-06-21 20:40:49	@Espyo	but what, everything else in the game is exactly like a real-life product?
2016-06-21 20:40:57	@Espyo	plus the [[Doomsday Apparatus]] says 1kg
2016-06-21 20:40:58	Testyo	1 kg = 0.1575 st / 2.2046 lb / 35.274 oz
2016-06-21 20:41:04	@Espyo	Yoshi2: small packages?
2016-06-21 20:41:23	Marty2000	Yeah, definitely a mistake to me too
2016-06-21 20:41:57	Yoshi2	https://www.maggi.de/produkte/fix-und-frisch/maggi-fix-und-frisch-gemuese-pfanne-mit-hackfleisch something like this
2016-06-21 20:42:23	Yoshi2	such packages are in the ballpark of 67 g
2016-06-21 20:42:25	Marty2000	Oh, off-topic, but I don't think it's mentioned somewhere: in NPC!P1, you cannot change the maturity of Yellow Pikmin holding bomb rocks
2016-06-21 20:43:37	Marty2000	I mean, by pressing down whie holding a pikmin,
2016-06-21 20:43:44	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-21 20:43:46	Marty2000	you can change the maturity of the Pikmin you're holding
2016-06-21 20:43:51	@Espyo	I guess that's about right
2016-06-21 20:43:54	Marty2000	This isn't possible with those who are holding bombs
2016-06-21 20:44:00	@Espyo	but what the hell is it doing on the label of a jar of honey?
2016-06-21 20:44:18	@Espyo	Marty2000: I think you explained this before, but we just never added it to the wiki
2016-06-21 20:44:27	@Espyo	and I'm having wicked dejá vu right now
2016-06-21 20:44:47	@Espyo	err, *déjà vu
2016-06-21 20:44:58	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-21 20:45:01	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-21 20:46:04	@Espyo	Yoshi2: I checked some packets I own, between 75 and 80g, yeah
2016-06-21 20:46:23	@Espyo	also, the rest of the label wouldn't happen to say anything special, would it?
2016-06-21 20:51:46	Marty2000	Hmm, I'd have something interesting, please wait...; (taking photos)

2016-06-21 21:00:00	Marty2000	Back
2016-06-21 21:00:24	Marty2000	So, even though I don't think that's the case.... maybe they put the weight in liter behind?
2016-06-21 21:00:40	Marty2000	My photo shows the weight in grams and what it is in liters (when cooked)

2016-06-21 21:01:03	@Espyo	ok, my mum just had a brilliant idea
2016-06-21 21:01:08	@Espyo	that's likely not the jar itself

2016-06-21 21:01:10	@Espyo	it's the weight in honey
2016-06-21 21:01:14	@Espyo	solely in honey
2016-06-21 21:01:14	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-21 21:01:22	@Espyo	and what's more, that jar's not as big as we're thinking, probably
2016-06-21 21:01:25	@Espyo	we should check in-game
2016-06-21 21:01:30	@Espyo	to determine its size
2016-06-21 21:01:47	@Espyo	yeah, some of my packets have the same, too
2016-06-21 21:01:52	@Espyo	in regards to the images you took
2016-06-21 21:02:13	Yoshi2	yup, if the jar is small, the weight could be correct
2016-06-21 21:02:22	@Espyo	I mean, it DOES need the strength of 8 Pikmin
2016-06-21 21:02:31	@Espyo	which is pretty small
2016-06-21 21:02:43	@Espyo	the Solar System's lamp requires, what, 10?

2016-06-21 21:03:03	@Espyo	right
2016-06-21 21:03:07	@Espyo	so it's only a bit heavier
2016-06-21 21:03:09	@Espyo	this has to be small
2016-06-21 21:03:15	@Espyo	and the 67 would actually make sense

2016-06-21 22:17:03	@Espyo	why would they make this one up?
2016-06-21 22:17:17	@Espyo	I'll reword the trivia so it sounds more correct
2016-06-21 22:18:32	@Espyo	so, it's not bad to think the full treasure weighs 80 grams, maybe
2016-06-21 22:18:41	@Espyo	and if 8 Pikmin need to carry it...
2016-06-21 22:18:46	@Espyo	 1 Pikmin can carry 10 grams
2016-06-21 22:19:07	En_Passant	Which is inconsistent with the Doomsday Apparatus' 1 gram, of course
2016-06-21 22:19:12	@Espyo	bingo
2016-06-21 22:19:31	En_Passant	I wonder how it compares with other treasures
2016-06-21 22:19:51	@Espyo	we have a sentence on the Proton AA, on the Doomsday Apparatus's article
2016-06-21 22:19:56	@Espyo	>The label on this object says that the Doomsday Apparatus weighs 1 kilogram. This discovery has lead to a lot of confusion. Although creating a formula from this would allow easy conversion between the in-game weight units and real-world units, the theory breaks down when real-world objects are weighed and compared to the weights predicted. For example, the Proton AA treasure weighs 6 units, whereas actual AA batteries weigh as muc
2016-06-21 22:19:56	Testyo	1 kilogram = 0.1575 st / 2.2046 lb / 35.274 oz
2016-06-21 22:20:33	En_Passant	[[Proton AA]]
2016-06-21 22:20:34	Testyo	"Proton_AA" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Proton_AA
2016-06-21 22:23:27	@Espyo	so, all this time, it turns out I was using alpha wrong on the engine
2016-06-21 22:23:34	@Espyo	so a lot of objects got this weird dark glow around them
2016-06-21 22:23:38	@Espyo	one simple instruction fixed all that
2016-06-21 22:23:45	@Espyo	everything looks so much smoother and livelier now
2016-06-21 22:23:56	@Espyo	...I never want to have to think about premultiplied alpha again, though

2016-06-21 22:39:40	Marty2000	"having a group of at least less than twelve Pikmin" only this is incorrect, I think (works with any amount of Pikmin, normally)
2016-06-21 22:39:43	Marty2000	number*
2016-06-21 22:40:02	@Espyo	really any amount?
2016-06-21 22:40:18	@Espyo	hm, I wonder if it depends on the control scheme
2016-06-21 22:40:20	@Espyo	I have a hunch...
2016-06-21 22:40:23	Marty2000	I do think
2016-06-21 22:40:31	Marty2000	I'll check in 10 minutes
2016-06-21 22:40:49	@Espyo	all right
2016-06-21 22:44:24	Marty2000	Okay, I'll check now, I was doing some Splatoon science about matchmaking
2016-06-21 22:44:55	Marty2000	I think I found something maybe interesting, but it's probably on Inkipedia
2016-06-21 22:46:22	Marty2000	So, I have to check:
2016-06-21 22:46:31	Marty2000	1) with an mportant number of Pikmin
2016-06-21 22:46:42	Marty2000	2) different control schemes
2016-06-21 22:47:02	Marty2000	Also, as I said, leaders tend to look at things like:
2016-06-21 22:47:05	Marty2000	working Pikmin
2016-06-21 22:47:09	Marty2000	Candypop Buds

2016-06-21 22:49:40	@Espyo	right, right
2016-06-21 22:49:44	@Espyo	also, you want some Splatoon science?
2016-06-21 22:49:54	@Espyo	here's a funny thing me, Gaming98, and Thomas keep thinking
2016-06-21 22:50:03	@Espyo	it's a joke, but it happens so often we're starting to think it's real
2016-06-21 22:50:22	@Espyo	almost every single time one of us is trying to join a game in progress that another one of us is in
2016-06-21 22:50:37	@Espyo	the game will disconnect a random person on that group to give room
2016-06-21 22:50:57	Marty2000	Heh... :/
2016-06-21 22:51:01	@Espyo	it's a joke; obviously the game would never purposely disconnect people without their being a connection issue or if they got banned somehow
2016-06-21 22:51:02	@Espyo	...
2016-06-21 22:51:05	@Espyo	but it happens 9 times out of 10
2016-06-21 22:51:09	@Espyo	that's too much to be coincidence
2016-06-21 22:51:18	@Espyo	which is both hilarious and actually freaking terrifying :|
2016-06-21 22:51:22	@Espyo	what the hell is this game, man...

2016-06-21 22:54:10	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-21 22:54:41	Marty2000	I'm testing right now... and seems true, actually :o I'm surprised. Also, Pikmin can look at the screen (so you, the real player) with that "trick"
2016-06-21 22:55:08	@Espyo	hm? what seems true?
2016-06-21 22:55:24	Marty2000	"having a group of at least less than twelve Pikmin"
2016-06-21 22:55:29	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-21 22:55:29	Marty2000	Yep, doesn't work with 13 Pikmin
2016-06-21 22:55:32	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-06-21 22:55:48	Marty2000	...works with 13 Pikmin with perseverance :p
2016-06-21 22:55:52	@Espyo	:/
2016-06-21 22:55:58	@Espyo	but with 12, it's very common?
2016-06-21 22:56:02	@Espyo	and 13+ very uncommon?
2016-06-21 22:56:03	@Espyo	that it?
2016-06-21 22:56:06	Marty2000	o, just as common as 13
2016-06-21 22:56:09	Marty2000	Actually
2016-06-21 22:56:11	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-21 22:56:18	Marty2000	I was testing with Winged Pikmi
2016-06-21 22:56:21	Marty2000	Pikmin*
2016-06-21 22:56:25	Marty2000	and it seems to not work with them
2016-06-21 22:57:21	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-21 22:57:24	Marty2000	I have 20 Pikmin, it's still working
2016-06-21 22:57:38	Marty2000	Oh, I have an idea!
2016-06-21 22:57:45	Marty2000	It doesn't work with flying Pikmin...
2016-06-21 22:57:54	Marty2000	But what if I try with walking Winged Pikmin??
2016-06-21 22:58:12	Marty2000	May work...!
2016-06-21 22:58:50	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-21 22:58:51	@Espyo	maybe
2016-06-21 22:58:56	Marty2000	I'll try
2016-06-21 22:59:05	Marty2000	Heading to the Distant Tundra
2016-06-21 23:00:14	En_Passant	It doesn't seem like Pikmin who are busy would watch the cursor
2016-06-21 23:00:38	Marty2000	You can have non-busy alking Winged Pikmin with geysers (so, who follow you) 
2016-06-21 23:00:51	Marty2000	They start flying once you start moving after using a geyser
2016-06-21 23:01:13	Marty2000	And I can confirm the trick works with walking Winged Pikmin, Espyo
2016-06-21 23:01:23	Marty2000	But it doesn't with those who are flying
2016-06-21 23:01:31	@Espyo	heh, nice
2016-06-21 23:02:50	Marty2000	Seems the trick doesn't work with 100 Pikmin, though...
2016-06-21 23:02:59	Marty2000	I have to find the max "cap"
2016-06-21 23:03:46	Marty2000	More than 51
2016-06-21 23:04:19	Marty2000	More than 60...
2016-06-21 23:05:37	Marty2000	It's 66 (comprised)
2016-06-21 23:06:02	Marty2000	You can see it better if you have 67 Pikmin on the field and order one to enter its Onion:
2016-06-21 23:06:13	Marty2000	the trick will only work once the Pikmin has entered the Master Onion
2016-06-21 23:07:08	Marty2000	Ok, so I can confirm that
2016-06-21 23:07:19	Marty2000	wherever you are, it doesn't work if you have 67 pikmin or more
2016-06-21 23:07:21	Marty2000	Pikmin*
2016-06-21 23:07:35	Marty2000	I'll edit the article
2016-06-21 23:10:00	Marty2000	Done
2016-06-21 23:10:15	Marty2000	Oh, I forgot to check with the Gamepad, but should be the same
2016-06-21 23:10:24	Marty2000	Checking...
2016-06-21 23:10:44	Marty2000	Yeah, works with the Gamepad as well
2016-06-21 23:12:05	Marty2000	However, still works if the 67 Pikmin is in seed form
2016-06-21 23:12:09	Marty2000	64th*

2016-06-22 03:18:32	Scruffy	So, I finished some animation of a "Slurptongue" Bulborb today
2016-06-22 03:18:38	Scruffy	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Slurptongue_Bulborb.png this guy
2016-06-22 03:18:54	@PikFan	ooh, nice
2016-06-22 03:19:04	Scruffy	I wanted to show you a gif just to get some feedback on the look
2016-06-22 03:19:17	@PikFan	yes, please show it
2016-06-22 03:19:22	Scruffy	It's different from normal paper mario stuff since it'll be sort of a boss
2016-06-22 03:19:32	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-06-22 03:19:37	@PikFan	should be interesting then!
2016-06-22 03:20:13	Scruffy	It's a work-in-progress, I'm posting it now
2016-06-22 03:20:33	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-22 03:20:51	Scruffy	https://imgur.com/Vh5We0Y
2016-06-22 03:21:22	Scruffy	I wanted to make it look sort of paper-mache, stop-motion-esque
2016-06-22 03:22:02	Scruffy	And the spot on its back is the color it's been drinking most
2016-06-22 03:22:15	@PikFan	interesting!
2016-06-22 03:22:43	Scruffy	It'll look better in the final environment, but for now I like it clashing with the normal 2D characters
2016-06-22 03:23:02	@PikFan	hmm, yeah
2016-06-22 03:57:08	@PikFan	what areas will be used?
2016-06-22 04:03:22	Scruffy	I'm not quite sure yet
2016-06-22 04:03:32	Scruffy	I think I'll be making them up for the most part
2016-06-22 04:03:38	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-22 04:04:02	@PikFan	will they be done in the style of the paper Awakening Wood?
2016-06-22 04:04:04	Scruffy	Since regular Pikmin areas won't really fit the bill; these will be more linearly designed in sections
2016-06-22 04:04:15	Scruffy	I was thinking so, but with more detail
2016-06-22 04:04:39	@PikFan	mm, I see
2016-06-22 04:07:02	Scruffy	Plus the paper bulborbs in that image won't be the same...

2016-06-22 12:28:29	Klemen702	it could be annoying

2016-06-22 19:36:08	Yoshi2	which means zooming in a lot is really slow because my code scales the entire image up

2016-06-22 21:11:33	@Espyo	http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v336/RandomTalkingBush/SplatoonPlazaPreview.png~original hold the phone
2016-06-22 21:11:38	@Espyo	what's with that drawing of the squid sisters?
2016-06-22 21:13:03	Marty2000	Remins me of a toy for kids, to be honest
2016-06-22 21:13:06	Marty2000	reminds*
2016-06-22 21:13:11	Marty2000	I don't recall the name, sorry
2016-06-22 21:23:26	Yoshi2	I am not sure what is more suprising
2016-06-22 21:23:30	Yoshi2	the rendering of the plaza
2016-06-22 21:23:40	Yoshi2	or that somebody still uploads photos to photobucket in 2016
2016-06-22 21:24:18	@Espyo	right?
2016-06-22 21:25:22	Yoshi2	so that drawing of the squid sisters is behind the screen that is normally there?
2016-06-22 21:26:24	@Espyo	I don't know, and I REALLY want to find out
2016-06-22 21:26:28	@Espyo	but I can't find any info on it
2016-06-22 21:26:34	@Espyo	looks like fanart, but...
2016-06-22 21:26:42	@Espyo	http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-26692-post-592122.html#pid592122
2016-06-22 21:26:54	@Espyo	why would RTB randomly decide to plop that texture there?
2016-06-22 21:29:35	Yoshi2	it would make sense
2016-06-22 21:42:28	Yoshi2	ugh, can't really combine the two methods
2016-06-22 21:45:03	Yoshi2	meh, the higher drawing time isn't worth the faster zooming
2016-06-22 21:48:35	Yoshi2	hmm, what if I use QPixmap instead of QImage

2016-06-22 21:49:47	@PikFan	so Splatoon is pissing me off today
2016-06-22 21:50:02	@PikFan	for some reason the people are way too OP today
2016-06-22 21:50:12	@PikFan	plus the maps right now are pretty sucky
2016-06-22 21:50:17	@PikFan	not to mention, lag
2016-06-22 21:50:21	@PikFan	sigh...
2016-06-22 21:50:50	Marty2000	Hi Splatoon
2016-06-22 21:50:54	Marty2000	PikFan*
2016-06-22 21:50:56	Marty2000	...lol
2016-06-22 21:51:00	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-22 21:53:04	Marty2000	I see. I did some science about matchmaking recently, since I made a new save
2016-06-22 21:53:32	Marty2000	It seems obvious, but the matchmaking in Turf War will depend on the number of players you kill
2016-06-22 21:53:35	Marty2000	Example:
2016-06-22 21:53:38	Marty2000	I was level 1
2016-06-22 21:54:07	Marty2000	If I kill a lot of people, I will face level 50 players very soon (once I reach level 3, maybe)
2016-06-22 21:54:39	Marty2000	If I kill nobody, I will face people with the same level as mine (I'm supposed to have, if you prefer)
2016-06-22 21:54:52	Marty2000	The number of points does not affect anything
2016-06-22 21:55:19	Marty2000	If you kill 20 people but have 500 points, there's no problem, you will face level 50 players as a level 5
2016-06-22 21:55:43	@Espyo	a QPixmap would likely be faster, yeah
2016-06-22 21:55:51	@PikFan	hi Espyo
2016-06-22 21:55:54	@Espyo	hey PikFan
2016-06-22 21:55:54	@PikFan	a who what now
2016-06-22 21:56:16	Marty2000	If you kill 0 player but have 1500 points, you will still fight players with the same level as you (roughly)
2016-06-22 21:56:32	Scruffy	Hi PikFan!
2016-06-22 21:56:32	@PikFan	what about your deaths? do deaths matter?
2016-06-22 21:56:33	Scruffy	brb
2016-06-22 21:56:36	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-06-22 21:57:04	Marty2000	PikFan: It didn't impact anything, I think
2016-06-22 21:57:11	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-22 21:57:38	@PikFan	so if your k/d ratio is 0 then you won't be matched against better players
2016-06-22 21:58:04	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-22 21:58:13	Marty2000	(at least when you have a low level)
2016-06-22 22:05:27	@PikFan	the user Zephosbat on the forums, regarding their Pikmin 4 walkthrough:
2016-06-22 22:05:30	@PikFan	"Don't suppose anyone is reading this lol?"
2016-06-22 22:05:57	@PikFan	unfortunately, nobody's reading it, because nobody appreciates literature in this particular community
2016-06-22 22:07:08	Testyo	Yoshi2 there electricity company charges you
2016-06-22 22:07:16	Marty2000	Lol
2016-06-22 22:07:17	@PikFan	...lolwut
2016-06-22 22:07:26	Yoshi2	oh NOOOOOOOOOOo
2016-06-22 22:07:44	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2016-06-22 22:07:45	Testyo	I said Yoshi2 there electricity company charges you because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages Yoshi2 there was one and or 0.035 'units' the electricity company charges you.
2016-06-22 22:07:53	Yoshi2	mkay
2016-06-22 22:07:57	@PikFan	the electricity company loan sharks are coming for you Yoshi2
2016-06-22 22:09:28	Yoshi2	Espyo: perfect, absolutely perfect. QPainter.drawPixmap allows you to specify the target area to draw in, and the source area to read from, and it will scale the source into the target area
2016-06-22 22:09:36	Yoshi2	quick drawing + quick zooming
2016-06-22 22:09:53	Marty2000	PikFan: nice reference :p
2016-06-22 22:10:02	@PikFan	hehe
2016-06-22 22:11:41	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-06-22 22:11:48	@Espyo	yeah, there had to be SOMETHING
2016-06-22 22:12:07	Yoshi2	there are some weird artifacts when scrolling, but ehhhhhhh I will take that for the moment
2016-06-22 22:12:17	@Espyo	uh, weir

2016-06-22 22:12:27	@PikFan	Marty: someone on my Skype group said "S rank is hell"
2016-06-22 22:12:27	@Espyo	but yeah, I'd take that too over painful slowness
2016-06-22 22:12:40	@PikFan	so I said "if S rank is hell then S+ rank is Tartarus"

2016-06-22 22:15:38	Marty2000	Because at this time, you'd lose more points for each loss

2016-06-22 22:49:24	@PikFan	how come?
2016-06-22 22:49:28	Scruffy	I had lost the cable for my theremin for several years, but now I got a new one and it still works!
2016-06-22 22:49:31	Scruffy	It's so much fun!
2016-06-22 22:49:39	@PikFan	theremin?
2016-06-22 22:49:52	Scruffy	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin
2016-06-22 22:49:55	@PikFan	oh, a musical instrument
2016-06-22 22:49:58	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-22 22:49:59	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-22 22:50:16	Scruffy	You play it without touching it
2016-06-22 22:50:38	Scruffy	It creates an electronic field and the disruption of that field creates a signal that amplifies a sound
2016-06-22 22:50:49	Marty2000	Oh, that's cool!
2016-06-22 22:50:57	@PikFan	woah
2016-06-22 22:51:35	Scruffy	If you've ever heard a weird sine-wave-like whistling or whining sound in old sci-fi alien movies, it's probably theremin
2016-06-22 22:52:09	Scruffy	Also it was used in the Beach Boys' song Good Vibrations, where it became a /slightly/ more mainstream instrument
2016-06-22 22:52:15	Scruffy	But not much, it's pretty esoteric
2016-06-22 22:52:34	Scruffy	And very hard to play, since there's no way to hold a pitch except to keep your arm still
2016-06-22 22:53:29	Scruffy	And there's no reference for a pitch, you have to hear your way to the right note
2016-06-22 22:55:52	Scruffy	Finally we can play it again
2016-06-22 22:56:21	Scruffy	Plus it makes a great prank if you leave it on and someone passes by unsuspectingly and suddenly creates a sound
2016-06-22 22:56:39	@PikFan	hmm, that's pretty neat, I bet it takes a lot of practice
2016-06-22 22:56:43	@PikFan	hehe
2016-06-22 22:56:56	Scruffy	Yeah, I'm not great but it's quite fun

2016-06-23 00:06:05	Scruffy	Speaking of night, I'm working on Up Late
2016-06-23 00:06:47	Scruffy	I lost my old file of Pikmin 2 text, so I've had to redo it
2016-06-23 00:06:48	@PikFan	oooh
2016-06-23 00:07:00	@PikFan	awww!
2016-06-23 00:07:03	Scruffy	But that's good, since now I actually have a plot to it that's different from Pikmin 2
2016-06-23 00:07:15	Scruffy	So I can actually tailor it to that while still being funny
2016-06-23 00:07:37	Marty2000	Oh
2016-06-23 00:10:49	Scruffy	Have I told you guys the plot/
2016-06-23 00:10:50	Scruffy	?
2016-06-23 00:11:02	@PikFan	you did, a long time ago
2016-06-23 00:11:09	@PikFan	I forgot it though...
2016-06-23 00:11:12	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-23 00:11:58	Scruffy	Basically, Olimar /faked/ the crash in Pikmin 1 to try and escape Hocotate Freight
2016-06-23 00:12:18	Scruffy	But he didn't know PNF-404 was policed by dangerous creatures
2016-06-23 00:12:53	Scruffy	The Pikmin helped him escape so he could beat the news of his crimes (destruction, theft, disturbing the peace) back to Hocotate
2016-06-23 00:13:22	Scruffy	But the President heard it anyway, and figured this could be a great way to solve Hocotate Freight's 10000 poko debt
2016-06-23 00:13:51	Scruffy	So you have to return to the planet and *steal* the treasures to increase Captain Olimar's bounty to 10000 pokos

2016-06-23 00:34:03	Scruffy	Right

2016-06-23 18:36:32	@J	suddenly the biggest thunderclap I ever heard
2016-06-23 18:36:43	UltraMario	ono
2016-06-23 18:38:52	Marty2000	J: Suddenly, in France, the temperatures went from 20°C to around 35°C within a day or two
2016-06-23 18:39:38	Marty2000	I guess we'll have a storm soon
2016-06-23 18:41:42	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User_talk:Espyo#I_know_this... Even though he's not uploading images, it's still quite image-related work... :p

2016-06-23 18:44:28	@J	looks like I missed some drama
2016-06-23 18:45:51	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-06-23 18:46:01	Marty2000	How to say...
2016-06-23 18:46:30	Marty2000	This user is getting detested by some people because he keeps uploading personal images and he doesn't try to contribute to the wiki
2016-06-23 18:46:42	Marty2000	UltraMario: he was banned from MarioWiki, right?
2016-06-23 18:48:21	Marty2000	J: http://www.mariowiki.com/User:TabuuandPeach I have nothing against him, but the problem is that he uploads too many personal images, and tries to move images without changing the links in the concerned articles

2016-06-23 18:53:54	Marty2000	Hi Testyo
2016-06-23 18:53:54	Testyo	I remember using a GUI program for encoding video/audio ages ago that was built on top of ffmpeg, and now I'm pretty sure ffmpeg is easier to use than one dark secret
2016-06-23 18:53:59	Marty2000	And Espyo

2016-06-23 18:57:46	Yoshi2	ffmpeg is definitely easier to use than that one dark secret

2016-06-23 18:59:31	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-23 18:59:44	Marty2000	Espyo: he is creating image-related categories :)
2016-06-23 18:59:44	@Espyo	>Im now creating Wanted Pages which is good
2016-06-23 18:59:48	@Espyo	that is probably the WORST thing he can do
2016-06-23 19:00:08	@Espyo	uuuuuuuugggggghhhhh...
2016-06-23 19:00:24	Yoshi2	a page about which pages we want?
2016-06-23 19:00:39	@Espyo	I certainly hope not
2016-06-23 19:00:59	Scruffy	He's just creating all the image categories
2016-06-23 19:01:55	@Espyo	inb4 I'll have to edit every single one of them because there's something wrong
2016-06-23 19:02:54	@Espyo	ding ding ding ding ding!
2016-06-23 19:03:00	@Espyo	he didn't categorize the categories
2016-06-23 19:06:01	Marty2000	By the way, Pikipedia was slightly vandalized this afternoon
2016-06-23 19:06:04	Marty2000	I reverted the edits
2016-06-23 19:06:27	@Espyo	I saw
2016-06-23 19:06:35	@Espyo	I think that user kinda wanted to help
2016-06-23 19:06:39	@Espyo	at least in regards to adding a video to the glitch
2016-06-23 19:06:43	@Espyo	but apparently basic tasks are so hard
2016-06-23 19:06:46	@Espyo	so he just butchered it all
2016-06-23 19:07:03	Marty2000	That video shows another glitch that is already in the article with the same video, though :p
2016-06-23 19:07:10	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-23 19:07:52	@Espyo	yeah, I noticed that, actually
2016-06-23 19:07:54	@Espyo	weird stuff
2016-06-23 19:26:19	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo, how did it go with 3DS Max on Wine?
2016-06-23 19:41:21	@Espyo	horribly
2016-06-23 19:41:29	@Espyo	 2015 complains that it wants .NET Framework 4
2016-06-23 19:41:33	@Espyo	even though I already have it
2016-06-23 19:41:40	@Espyo	it offers to install it, but the installer just collapses
2016-06-23 19:41:46	@Espyo	then I tried 2009 and 2010
2016-06-23 19:41:55	@Espyo	both just fail with a generic error
2016-06-23 19:41:58	@Espyo	I just gave up
2016-06-23 19:42:00	@Espyo	hmmmmm...
2016-06-23 19:42:05	@Espyo	hey, I can try a virtual machine
2016-06-23 19:42:18	@Espyo	there's this one I have...
2016-06-23 19:42:21	@Espyo	okay, it's weird
2016-06-23 19:42:31	@Espyo	I installed a VM with windows 7 so I can use it to compile the engine for windows
2016-06-23 19:42:39	@Espyo	and apparently, microsoft offers free VMs, for 90 days
2016-06-23 19:42:47	@Espyo	and they recommend you re-load the save-state to go back the period
2016-06-23 19:42:52	@Espyo	so it's like free, but with a tiny limitation?
2016-06-23 19:44:08	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-06-23 19:44:13	@Espyo	uh, the date auto-adjusted when I opened it
2016-06-23 19:44:36	@Espyo	so I don't know if it's going to continue with the timer it was at, or if it's going to think I'm 7 months in the future or something
2016-06-23 19:44:49	@Espyo	>activate windows now
2016-06-23 19:44:53	@Espyo	...I'm guessing it's the latter, then
2016-06-23 19:44:55	Scruffy	that's weird
2016-06-23 19:45:01	@Espyo	this entire thing is weird
2016-06-23 19:46:27	@Espyo	yeah, it's saying the license is expired
2016-06-23 19:46:29	@Espyo	all right, screw this
2016-06-23 19:46:35	@Espyo	time to get a "legal" copy of windows
2016-06-23 19:46:39	@Espyo	I could just use the key I have on my old laptop
2016-06-23 19:46:41	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-23 19:46:50	@Espyo	doesn't microsoft provide downloads for their OSes?
2016-06-23 19:48:47	Scruffy	I think they provide upgrades
2016-06-23 19:49:01	Scruffy	But I don't know about regular downloads
2016-06-23 19:50:31	@Espyo	found it
2016-06-23 19:50:41	@Espyo	...but it's complaining my key is for a pre-installed windows
2016-06-23 19:50:44	@Espyo	..........and?
2016-06-23 19:50:49	@Espyo	this always worked
2016-06-23 19:50:53	@Espyo	why is it not work-- ugh
2016-06-23 19:50:55	@Espyo	you know what
2016-06-23 19:51:00	@Espyo	not gonna waste my time with this
2016-06-23 19:51:01	@Espyo	really aren't
2016-06-23 19:51:06	@Espyo	gonna pirate it and call it a day
2016-06-23 19:51:13	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-23 19:51:13	@Espyo	I literally can NOT care less
2016-06-23 19:51:52	@Espyo	I don't pirate games and such any more because I like contributing the developers and having my efforts pay off
2016-06-23 19:52:12	@Espyo	but if I were to go the right way for clunky 3ds max and this weird windows download just to extract a couple of models in a VM I'll use once a month
2016-06-23 19:52:14	@Espyo	I'd go insane
2016-06-23 19:52:22	@Espyo	*contributing to
2016-06-23 19:53:13	Scruffy	True
2016-06-23 19:53:19	Scruffy	Sorry to keep asking you for models
2016-06-23 19:53:34	@Espyo	it's fine
2016-06-23 19:53:37	@Espyo	I like to help
2016-06-23 19:53:43	@Espyo	it's just that the middle process between all of it is a pain
2016-06-23 19:53:49	@Espyo	so if I can cut the problems in the middle
2016-06-23 19:54:11	@Espyo	then providing models will be easy
2016-06-23 19:54:15	@Espyo	wait, which one exactly did you need?
2016-06-23 19:54:22	Scruffy	P3 Water Dumple
2016-06-23 19:54:48	@Espyo	nope, not on the archives...
2016-06-23 19:54:49	@Espyo	figures
2016-06-23 19:54:55	@Espyo	it's a bit of a specific and unpopular enemy
2016-06-23 19:56:12	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-23 19:56:19	Scruffy	I wanted to figure out more about its geometry
2016-06-23 19:56:27	Scruffy	And also CraftedPbody would like a render of it
2016-06-23 19:57:04	Scruffy	Oh! Also I figured out that, for sure, Nintendo's Gamecube game sounds sampled at 5,666 Hz are meant to be pitch-changed in game
2016-06-23 19:57:31	Scruffy	I saw the same occurrences in other sound dumps
2016-06-23 19:58:02	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-06-23 19:58:24	Scruffy	Otherwise, most of the other sounds are ones they recorded or produced in a lab, or stock sounds at high sample rates
2016-06-23 20:00:40	Scruffy	I don't know why Bulbmin or the Waterwraith would need pitch-changing algorithms in-game, but they undeniably have them
2016-06-23 20:03:34	@Espyo	right
2016-06-23 20:09:07	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Winged_Pikmin&curid=8140&diff=167735&oldid=167335 iunno...
2016-06-23 20:09:10	@Espyo	Yellows can reach it too
2016-06-23 20:09:20	@Espyo	and I don't think any Pikmin is more recommended than any other for this fight

2016-06-23 20:30:13	Marty2000	Oh, amazing, indeed!
2016-06-23 20:30:26	@J	Windows licenses is notoriously hard to get working even in legal circumstances
2016-06-23 20:31:07	@J	even when I had to reinstall on the same laptop once
2016-06-23 20:31:08	@J	nope
2016-06-23 20:31:32	@J	best thing I've seen for this is some 3rd party tool that saves a license from an existing installation then installs it to a different one
2016-06-23 20:31:50	@Espyo	that is so terrifying and awesome, Scruffy
2016-06-23 20:31:51	@Espyo	but
2016-06-23 20:31:56	@Espyo	feel free to take an artistic liberty on it

2016-06-23 20:32:27	@Espyo	I never had to reinstall windows often
2016-06-23 20:32:32	@Espyo	but every time I did, grabbing an old key worked
2016-06-23 20:32:44	@Espyo	ok, turns out that the current VM I have with this "trial" decided I still have 90 more days
2016-06-23 20:32:55	@Espyo	I DID try to install windows 7 pirated
2016-06-23 20:33:00	@Espyo	everything started crying everywhere
2016-06-23 20:33:08	@Espyo	settings, and BIOS settings, and compatibilities, and
2016-06-23 20:33:21	@Espyo	at this rate, it'll take me longer to get this to work than it'd take me to boot my old laptop and do it

2016-06-23 20:38:29	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-06-23 20:38:35	@Espyo	well, if you're already saying "or less", then the "included" is implied

2016-06-23 21:24:14	Scruffy	Yep, it's a demonstration of Pikmin Color Splash
2016-06-23 21:24:41	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-06-23 21:24:46	Neocraftz1553	sounds awsome
2016-06-23 21:25:44	Neocraftz1553	I have learned some of the basics of C#, too, so I might make a real gane, in a few months, years :p
2016-06-23 21:25:59	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-06-23 21:26:00	Neocraftz1553	because I can't get VS at the moment...

2016-06-23 21:26:41	Neocraftz1553	I have to get it on my phone, then onto my computer
2016-06-23 21:27:16	Neocraftz1553	funny thing is, an offline installer is about 3.20 GBs
2016-06-23 21:27:28	Neocraftz1553	My phone only has 1
2016-06-23 21:27:38	Neocraftz1553	so I have to use an SD card
2016-06-23 21:28:02	Neocraftz1553	very inefficient 
2016-06-23 21:31:00	Yoshi2	visual studio is huuuuuuuuuuuuuge

2016-06-23 23:46:07	@Espyo	ooooh, nice
2016-06-23 23:46:18	Scruffy	Espyo: it's good, but it doesn't allow you to access in-game files, from what I can tell
2016-06-23 23:46:21	Scruffy	It just emulates
2016-06-23 23:46:50	Scruffy	Plus, it's working out a glitch currently that plays all N64 titles twice as fast as normal, with no way to fix it
2016-06-23 23:47:06	Scruffy	I mean, no emulator's perfect
2016-06-23 23:47:11	Scruffy	But it's pretty neat so far
2016-06-23 23:47:30	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-23 23:47:32	Scruffy	I prefer not to download games unless I already legally own them elsewhere though
2016-06-23 23:47:37	@Espyo	I don't think any game between the Atari and the DS uses "files" proper
2016-06-23 23:47:43	@Espyo	well, a filesystem
2016-06-23 23:48:03	@Espyo	yeah, same
2016-06-23 23:48:13	@Espyo	unless it's like downloading the Japanese version of Pikmin 2, only to check this or that
2016-06-23 23:48:19	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-06-23 23:48:23	@Espyo	I am SERIOUSLY not causing Nintendo or any other company any downfall by doing that |:
2016-06-23 23:48:44	@Espyo	anyway, I'm trying to run a script from windows that converts the textures
2016-06-23 23:48:52	@Espyo	and apparently passing arguments under wine is insanely hard
2016-06-23 23:49:01	@Espyo	J: you wouldn't happen to have practice with this, would you?
2016-06-23 23:50:01	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-06-23 23:50:46	@Espyo	I mean, I can pass the model your way, that one is done
2016-06-23 23:51:10	Scruffy	Okay, i'll take it
2016-06-23 23:51:17	Scruffy	I can probably paint textures myself
2016-06-23 23:51:59	@Espyo	the virtual machine's not really showing me the model on 3ds max (max's fault, or virtualization's fault? who's to say)
2016-06-23 23:52:06	@Espyo	but I imported the 3DS into Blender, and it's fine, so

2016-06-23 23:52:53	@Espyo	don't really use it, but hey, it's nice to have it around
2016-06-23 23:53:00	@Espyo	maybe I'll learn to tinker with it one day
2016-06-23 23:53:42	Scruffy	If you ever need help with that, I'm happy to give you pointers
2016-06-23 23:53:55	@Espyo	hehe, thanks, good to know
2016-06-23 23:54:04	@Espyo	dunno when I'll start messing with it, if ever
2016-06-23 23:54:09	@Espyo	but not any time soon, most likely
2016-06-23 23:54:31	Scruffy	It is tricky
2016-06-23 23:54:38	@Espyo	I bet...
2016-06-23 23:54:48	Scruffy	And requires a powerful computer to create big projects
2016-06-23 23:55:07	Scruffy	Certainly more powerful than mine
2016-06-23 23:55:38	@Espyo	yikes
2016-06-23 23:56:57	Scruffy	But I'm feeling pretty confident about this Color Splash project
2016-06-23 23:57:21	Scruffy	It's paper, an easy material, and most of the movement is just sprites and not 3D animation
2016-06-23 23:57:37	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-06-23 23:57:52	@Espyo	but there are probably a few tricky things that are not immediately obvious
2016-06-23 23:58:01	Scruffy	True
2016-06-23 23:58:07	@Espyo	Paper Mario's art style doesn't strike me as "easy to make", although it sure seems like it
2016-06-23 23:58:32	Scruffy	Color Splash at least is more consistent, they specifically try to make everything look papercraft
2016-06-23 23:58:43	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-06-24 00:00:20	@Espyo	oh, I found a temporary way to do the textures
2016-06-24 00:00:23	@Espyo	gimme 5 minutes
2016-06-24 00:00:30	@Espyo	but I'll have to come up with something more permanent in the future...
2016-06-24 00:00:48	Scruffy	Heh, no problem
2016-06-24 00:00:48	@Espyo	...oh, there are only two textures
2016-06-24 00:01:26	Scruffy	Not a very complex animal
2016-06-24 00:01:36	@Espyo	guess so
2016-06-24 00:01:43	@Espyo	do you have the link to my model repository handy?
2016-06-24 00:01:52	@Espyo	it's there, under the name Water Dumple.zip
2016-06-24 00:01:59	Scruffy	Umm, I'm afraid I don't
2016-06-24 00:02:07	@Espyo	getting the links to stuff to share is a bit harder on Linux, since it doesn't integrate onto the "explorer"
2016-06-24 00:02:12	Scruffy	I just have the downloaded repository itself
2016-06-24 00:02:15	Scruffy	OH
2016-06-24 00:02:17	@Espyo	on windows, I can right-click on a folder on my Dropbox and get stuff like the download link
2016-06-24 00:02:18	Scruffy	oh*
2016-06-24 00:02:25	@Espyo	no worries, the browser version of Dropbox works

2016-06-24 00:10:31	Scruffy	Yeah, I'll have to mess with these
2016-06-24 00:14:21	@Espyo	hey, is the Water Dumple working all right?
2016-06-24 00:14:34	@Espyo	because I was about to close the VM, and noticed Max left some errors lying about
2016-06-24 00:14:38	Scruffy	Still downloading
2016-06-24 00:14:49	Scruffy	My Internet is being wonky right now
2016-06-24 00:15:26	@Espyo	well, I think it ended up right, but in case it didn't, I'm too tired to fix it now anyway
2016-06-24 00:15:28	@Espyo	need to sleep

2016-06-24 12:20:57	@Espyo	bad news, the UK is leaving the EU
2016-06-24 12:23:33	Yoshi2	the UK isn't leaving the EU just yet, just 52% voted for leaving
2016-06-24 12:34:04	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-24 12:34:16	@Espyo	well, some of my friends are pretty upset about it
2016-06-24 12:34:26	@Espyo	as for me, a non-Brit, it upsets me because it'll make it worse for me to fly there, mainly

2016-06-24 13:46:25	Yoshi2	I started drawing the water layer
2016-06-24 13:46:59	Yoshi2	option 1 (without color mixing): https://i.imgur.com/LXVmU3U.png option 2 with color mixing: https://i.imgur.com/zVgo95j.png 
2016-06-24 13:48:23	Yoshi2	option 1 looks crude and option 2 has incompatible colors
2016-06-24 13:48:42	@Espyo	huh, how weird
2016-06-24 13:48:52	@Espyo	well, you have to continue with option 2, but fix it
2016-06-24 13:49:36	Yoshi2	option 2 is because for the tiles that have brighter colors, I don't have any height information
2016-06-24 13:50:09	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-24 13:50:10	Yoshi2	*option 2 is so
2016-06-24 13:50:11	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-06-24 13:51:09	Yoshi2	if I get the lowest height that might fix it
2016-06-24 13:51:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-24 13:55:00	Yoshi2	now, I don't know the lowest height until I draw the terrain, and I need to draw the ocean before I draw the terrain
2016-06-24 13:58:42	Yoshi2	solution: draw terrain, make new picture, draw ocean on new picture, draw terrain on it
2016-06-24 14:00:51	@Espyo	heh, might as well
2016-06-24 14:01:06	Yoshi2	hmm, "pick the lowest" is not as simple as expected
2016-06-24 14:01:47	Yoshi2	uhh, I will store the lowest per tile, I guess
2016-06-24 14:14:48	Yoshi2	more complicated, but should be more correct
2016-06-24 14:26:56	@Espyo	yes
2016-06-24 14:28:01	Yoshi2	send help
2016-06-24 14:28:42	@Espyo	no help for the wicked

2016-06-24 15:36:29	Yoshi2	screw the complicated idea
2016-06-24 15:36:48	Yoshi2	instead of calculating the lowest height I will retrieve the color value used for the lowest height
2016-06-24 15:36:54	Yoshi2	and fill the entire map with that
2016-06-24 15:38:34	Yoshi2	because honestly
2016-06-24 15:38:44	Yoshi2	that is not 100% correct but it's CLOSE ENOUGH

2016-06-24 20:54:59	En_Passant	Hey Espyo, can I ask you a favor?
2016-06-24 20:55:06	@Espyo	yeah?
2016-06-24 20:55:38	En_Passant	Can I interview you about your job?
2016-06-24 20:55:49	@Espyo	hm, well, I guess
2016-06-24 20:55:52	@Espyo	for what purpose?
2016-06-24 20:56:20	En_Passant	Some paperwork regarding opening a case with vocational rehab
2016-06-24 20:56:39	En_Passant	Not that I'm having troubles with my job, but they might be able to pay for college
2016-06-24 20:56:57	@Espyo	oh, so you're working while studying?
2016-06-24 20:59:10	En_Passant	I will be doing work study, but that's not related
2016-06-24 20:59:52	@Espyo	not quite sure I follow, then
2016-06-24 21:00:17	En_Passant	The DVR helps people get jobs. In my case, I'm saying that my job (as a cashier) is not suitable for my intelligence, and that college is the best way to get a real job
2016-06-24 21:00:41	En_Passant	Part of the application is interviewing someone in the field you want a job in
2016-06-24 21:01:01	@Espyo	ah, I get it now
2016-06-24 21:01:13	@Espyo	all right, go ahead
2016-06-24 21:01:46	@Espyo	but there might be questions I can't answer due to non-disclosure agreements
2016-06-24 21:02:03	@Espyo	not like they have IPs they need to protect or anything, but I still shouldn't babble TOO much
2016-06-24 21:02:07	@Espyo	doubt you'll ask me anything too deep, though
2016-06-24 21:02:13	En_Passant	It doesn't get too specifics
2016-06-24 21:02:16	En_Passant	*specific
2016-06-24 21:02:27	En_Passant	It's about how you feel about it
2016-06-24 21:02:39	@Espyo	all righy
2016-06-24 21:02:41	@Espyo	*righty
2016-06-24 21:02:53	En_Passant	Okay, question 1: What are some positives and negatives of the position?
2016-06-24 21:03:03	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-06-24 21:03:16	@Espyo	might be hard to answer that one without getting some of the pros and cons of my company as well
2016-06-24 21:03:38	@Espyo	since my company is so casual and all, I have pleasures and displeasures that don't happen in most other countries
2016-06-24 21:03:41	@Espyo	*most other companies
2016-06-24 21:04:17	@Espyo	do you want to know more about my position as specific as a junior developer for an engine, or as a general software developer?
2016-06-24 21:04:29	En_Passant	Software developer
2016-06-24 21:04:39	@Espyo	all right
2016-06-24 21:04:45	En_Passant	I think... it's game design, so whichever is more appropriate
2016-06-24 21:04:52	@Espyo	right
2016-06-24 21:05:09	@Espyo	perhaps one of the biggest pros of developing software is that there is no "one" solution to the tasks you need to complete
2016-06-24 21:05:17	@Espyo	meaning you have a large amount of liberty in doing them
2016-06-24 21:05:35	@Espyo	you can tackle the piece of code you need to develop in almost any way, and it will work fine
2016-06-24 21:06:05	@Espyo	due to it being so flexible and being so hard to obtain a "best" plan, you also discuss plans and implementations with your coworkers a lot
2016-06-24 21:06:14	@Espyo	making it a constant team-effort
2016-06-24 21:06:31	@Espyo	contrast to other jobs where you're tasked with doing the same monotonous thing every day, with little interaction
2016-06-24 21:07:09	@Espyo	the gratification of the work you do is also great, since every time you type code successfully or draw some assets or align some components on some piece of software, you get immediate results
2016-06-24 21:07:22	@Espyo	things can go from non-existent to existent with ease, or broken to fixed
2016-06-24 21:08:02	@Espyo	one "meta" advantage of such a job is that, since software development is so requested for nowadays, several companies of different types will be available to give you a position
2016-06-24 21:08:25	@Espyo	which means you don't have to stick with companies with poor pay, bad worker relations, etc.
2016-06-24 21:08:52	En_Passant	Hadn't thought about that
2016-06-24 21:08:59	@Espyo	most software, and especially game companies, are very modern and relaxed in nature, which makes working quite a pleasure
2016-06-24 21:09:13	@Espyo	yeah, there are a lot of good parts about it
2016-06-24 21:09:29	En_Passant	Even though it's relaxing in nature, is it still stressful?
2016-06-24 21:09:30	@Espyo	I'm mostly talking about coding in software, and not so much specifically games, or not so much as general as "developing"
2016-06-24 21:09:45	@Espyo	since developing something can go from creating graphics, to directing the plot, to writing the code
2016-06-24 21:09:51	@Espyo	I don't have much experience with areas outside of code
2016-06-24 21:09:54	En_Passant	Yeah, it's very broad
2016-06-24 21:09:57	@Espyo	though my company is always open to ideas and the like
2016-06-24 21:10:10	@Espyo	so sorry if my answers aren't exactly inclined to what you're expecting
2016-06-24 21:10:21	En_Passant	It's fine
2016-06-24 21:10:24	@Espyo	the harsher parts about my job are quite specific to it
2016-06-24 21:10:34	@Espyo	you rarely get to work on projects that are entirely yours
2016-06-24 21:10:43	@Espyo	which means other people have, are, and will be writing code on the same project as you
2016-06-24 21:10:49	@Espyo	and this can get very complicated, very fast
2016-06-24 21:11:01	@Espyo	even if everybody is organized, jumping into a bit of code that you never saw before will give you trouble
2016-06-24 21:11:12	@Espyo	like I said earlier, there's almost never a "right" way to fix a glitch or add a feature
2016-06-24 21:11:26	@Espyo	so code you read could either make a lot of sense, or be a quickly-spat solution
2016-06-24 21:11:58	@Espyo	meaning that if you need to fix a glitch, you'll have to find what components of the code are involved with it, and in those, trying to find what parts are related to the problem
2016-06-24 21:12:11	@Espyo	and then finding the specific instructions that are badly made and are causing problems
2016-06-24 21:12:28	@Espyo	there are tools to help you out, but the more complicated the problem is, the more complicated fixing it, almost exponentially
2016-06-24 21:13:35	@Espyo	the deeper you dig, the harder the code becomes to read, since it's so abstract (for instance, a function that controls the gravity and physics of an object vs a function that simply applies vertical force to the playable character)
2016-06-24 21:13:42	@Espyo	and the harder it is for tools to help you
2016-06-24 21:14:04	@Espyo	(in coding in particular, tools are known to break or respond in weird ways when you start going too deep)
2016-06-24 21:14:20	@Espyo	finding out that the problem is a minus sign when it should be a plus sign is gratifying
2016-06-24 21:14:28	En_Passant	It sounds like it's not so much working as group, but rather working individually on the same thing
2016-06-24 21:14:29	@Espyo	you hunted down the problem, and snared it like it was nothing
2016-06-24 21:14:42	@Espyo	but your fix could've broken something else along the line, much more dangerously
2016-06-24 21:14:47	@Espyo	so you can never really fix stuff in peace
2016-06-24 21:15:06	@Espyo	what's more, if you find out that this code wasn't working right because the engine of this feature isn't built to support this specific behavior...
2016-06-24 21:15:11	@Espyo	you may have to code in the behavior yourself
2016-06-24 21:15:21	@Espyo	meaning a full implementation of something just to fix one tiny problem
2016-06-24 21:15:27	@Espyo	depending on how you look at it, it can be vexing, or rewarding
2016-06-24 21:15:39	@Espyo	yeah, you spend a lot of your time coding by yourself
2016-06-24 21:15:48	@Espyo	but the solitude is broken very often
2016-06-24 21:15:59	@Espyo	from having to speak to other people to coordinate who takes care of what part in that bug
2016-06-24 21:16:08	@Espyo	to turning to the person next to you for a quick advice
2016-06-24 21:16:25	@Espyo	to proper sessions put in place by the company or the team coordinator called pair-programming
2016-06-24 21:16:37	@Espyo	which, as the name would imply, put two people to work on the same computer to fix a problem or add a feature
2016-06-24 21:16:43	@Espyo	two heads think better than one, after all
2016-06-24 21:17:14	@Espyo	of course that's not always used, since some bugs are as simple as tracking down the exact line that's calculating the value wrong and simply putting in the right value; and you can tell that that's the problem right away
2016-06-24 21:17:24	@Espyo	and having two people together, just for one of them to do all the work, isn't very optimized
2016-06-24 21:17:37	@Espyo	(and of course, having two people tap at the same keyboard is NOT a thing, unlike what Hollywood thinks)
2016-06-24 21:18:13	@Espyo	I guess the other big problem about my job is that, since there are so many companies requesting candidates, and so many candidates...
2016-06-24 21:18:21	@Espyo	if you're not that good, they can easily find a replacement
2016-06-24 21:18:32	@Espyo	you can be specialized in one thing, or one tool
2016-06-24 21:18:46	@Espyo	but in general, to be a software developer, you should be ready to handle almost any language, or any tool
2016-06-24 21:19:12	@Espyo	at times, your team leader might decide you should work on that task, that instead of using comfortable code, uses databases that you never touched
2016-06-24 21:19:29	@Espyo	normally, the team leader knows your strengths and weaknesses, so you can't be booed off for being very bad
2016-06-24 21:19:42	@Espyo	but you are expected to find a way to do it
2016-06-24 21:19:55	@Espyo	so it's both a stressful experience, but also a really rewarding one, since you learn
2016-06-24 21:20:21	@Espyo	in the case of coding in particular, you need to be good at understanding how numbers work, how computer instructions manipulate numbers, and what effects that has
2016-06-24 21:20:31	@Espyo	so if you're not quite on point, things can get very confusing
2016-06-24 21:20:42	@Espyo	I guess that's about it for advantages and disadvantages for doing what I do
2016-06-24 21:20:49	En_Passant	I see
2016-06-24 21:22:36	En_Passant	The last part sounds scary, but it sounds like a good experience
2016-06-24 21:22:40	@Espyo	oh, one important disadvantage
2016-06-24 21:22:40	@Espyo	health
2016-06-24 21:22:49	@Espyo	you're sitting on the same spot for hours on end, looking at a computer monitor
2016-06-24 21:22:55	@Espyo	if you don't take proper care of yourself...
2016-06-24 21:22:59	@Espyo	well, present you might be all right
2016-06-24 21:23:03	@Espyo	future you will likely be horrible
2016-06-24 21:23:13	@Espyo	well, I DID overemphasize it
2016-06-24 21:23:25	@Espyo	one thing I've learned about being there for a year and a half
2016-06-24 21:23:28	@Espyo	is that nobody knows anything
2016-06-24 21:23:35	@Espyo	they just know how to get things done, and ask for help
2016-06-24 21:23:37	@Espyo	me included
2016-06-24 21:23:44	@Espyo	(maybe my boss excluded, he's kind of a wizard)
2016-06-24 21:25:39	@Espyo	dinner now
2016-06-24 21:25:44	En_Passant	Oh, okay
2016-06-24 21:25:48	@Espyo	feel free to write up further questions, I'll answer when I return
2016-06-24 21:27:09	En_Passant	Yeah, some of these questions are very similar to each other
2016-06-24 21:27:25	En_Passant	One of them is about stresses and rewards, and you answered that already
2016-06-24 21:29:13	En_Passant	I'd like to take the questions one at a time, so the next one is: Has there been anything that you didn't anticipate about the job but wish you did?
2016-06-24 21:41:15	Yoshi2	En_Passant: so you currently are working as a cashier but you want to go to college and this interview is part of an application process for something that will help you pay for college?
2016-06-24 21:41:43	En_Passant	Yes
2016-06-24 21:42:05	Yoshi2	alright
2016-06-24 21:42:12	En_Passant	I have already applied and committed to the college, but their scholarships are full-time
2016-06-24 21:42:30	En_Passant	I'm prepared to take a loan for the rest of it, but obviously, it would be great not to have to do that
2016-06-24 21:42:42	En_Passant	*their scholarship was not full-ride
2016-06-24 21:42:45	En_Passant	...
2016-06-24 21:44:09	Yoshi2	the scholarship only covers some of the time?
2016-06-24 21:48:42	En_Passant	Only valid every other month, Kappa
2016-06-24 21:51:58	Yoshi2	what
2016-06-24 22:01:30	@Espyo	hm, tricky question
2016-06-24 22:01:49	@Espyo	I guess
2016-06-24 22:02:03	@Espyo	jumping into an existing project was a LOT tougher than I anticipated
2016-06-24 22:02:08	@Espyo	I figured I'd get the hang of it after a bit
2016-06-24 22:02:15	@Espyo	but here I am today, and more than half of the code is still a mystery to me
2016-06-24 22:02:24	@Espyo	but, that seems to be true for anybody on my department
2016-06-24 22:02:32	@Espyo	so it just takes me aback, is all
2016-06-24 22:02:39	Yoshi2	or any person doing development
2016-06-24 22:02:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-24 22:02:54	En_Passant	or any person
2016-06-24 22:03:05	@Espyo	unless it's on a really simple project
2016-06-24 22:03:07	@Espyo	and even then...
2016-06-24 22:09:54	En_Passant	That's all?
2016-06-24 22:10:52	@Espyo	honestly, yeah
2016-06-24 22:10:53	@Espyo	for that question
2016-06-24 22:12:30	En_Passant	Okay
2016-06-24 22:12:55	En_Passant	Next question: What sort of training is there?
2016-06-24 22:13:45	En_Passant	(it actually asks which programs are best, but that probably isn't applicable across continents)
2016-06-24 22:15:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-24 22:15:03	@Espyo	I can still answer
2016-06-24 22:15:12	@Espyo	well, my company is smallish, and youngish
2016-06-24 22:15:29	@Espyo	so they don't have very complex newcomer integration programs
2016-06-24 22:15:51	@Espyo	when I joined, I was the last (and first, I think?) to enter a program they came up with
2016-06-24 22:16:01	@Espyo	which involved me spending my first month on the quality control department
2016-06-24 22:16:06	@Espyo	this had numerous benefits
2016-06-24 22:16:15	@Espyo	for one thing, when I joined, I had no idea how electronic bingo worked
2016-06-24 22:16:30	En_Passant	Do I want to know what that is?
2016-06-24 22:16:47	@Espyo	quality control?
2016-06-24 22:16:53	En_Passant	Electronic bingo
2016-06-24 22:16:56	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-24 22:17:01	@Espyo	well, it won't hurt to explain
2016-06-24 22:17:05	@Espyo	you know bingo
2016-06-24 22:17:11	En_Passant	Unless that was a metaphor for "didn't know jack"
2016-06-24 22:17:17	@Espyo	electronic bingo is, well, virtual bingo
2016-06-24 22:17:18	@Espyo	lol
2016-06-24 22:17:18	@Espyo	nah
2016-06-24 22:17:25	@Espyo	imagine a casino, and you have all of these machines
2016-06-24 22:17:30	@Espyo	classic slot machines
2016-06-24 22:17:32	@Espyo	virtual slot machines
2016-06-24 22:17:37	@Espyo	then you have virtual bingo
2016-06-24 22:17:47	@Espyo	the game gives you some bingo cards
2016-06-24 22:17:56	@Espyo	then you press play, which bet some money
2016-06-24 22:18:07	@Espyo	and some balls are extracted in quick succession
2016-06-24 22:18:29	@Espyo	when you get a pattern that matches one on the prize table, you get money prize
2016-06-24 22:18:40	@Espyo	you know, like scoring all numbers in a row on any card
2016-06-24 22:18:52	@Espyo	that's it, really
2016-06-24 22:19:01	@Espyo	for me, when I entered, it didn't take long at all to understand that part
2016-06-24 22:19:26	@Espyo	...but understanding how different bets work, different cards number worked, the process of buying extra balls, mystery progressive draws, the big jackpot, etc.
2016-06-24 22:19:31	@Espyo	that was quite a lot to take in
2016-06-24 22:19:41	@Espyo	of course, it eventually became as simple as walking
2016-06-24 22:19:48	@Espyo	but going in cold-turkey was horrible
2016-06-24 22:19:57	@Espyo	so me going in to the QC department from the start was great
2016-06-24 22:20:03	@Espyo	I learned how the machines and the games worked
2016-06-24 22:20:19	@Espyo	instead of jumping to code about something whose workings I wasn't even sure about
2016-06-24 22:20:38	@Espyo	only after that did I really go to the coding department
2016-06-24 22:20:50	@Espyo	I didn't get much special treatment, although I did spend like a week getting introduced to the code
2016-06-24 22:21:03	@Espyo	and then I was sent to fix glitches like any other employee
2016-06-24 22:21:07	@Espyo	but of course, simple ones
2016-06-24 22:21:18	@Espyo	until I just grew more competent and better at it
2016-06-24 22:21:30	@Espyo	other people who joined my department didn't get so lucky
2016-06-24 22:21:36	@Espyo	they had to learn what the games were about in a day or two
2016-06-24 22:21:39	@Espyo	and then go to the code straight after
2016-06-24 22:21:52	@Espyo	on one hand, you don't need much to understand how the games work
2016-06-24 22:22:07	@Espyo	but on another, they missed out a lot of important concepts that had to be taught ad-hoc while on the coding department
2016-06-24 22:22:16	@Espyo	however, in the past few months, my company implemented a coaching system
2016-06-24 22:22:34	@Espyo	it puts a volunteer employee as a coach for a newcomer
2016-06-24 22:22:39	@Espyo	and they coach them through 9 months
2016-06-24 22:22:45	@Espyo	they teach them everything
2016-06-24 22:23:18	@Espyo	not just concepts and how to work, but stuff like where the bathroom is, or even just serving as somebody to ask questions to
2016-06-24 22:24:45	@Espyo	yeah, that's it about training
2016-06-24 22:25:05	@Espyo	you don't really need much other than to get shown how the project is and how you'll be doing the things you'll be doing
2016-06-24 22:29:36	En_Passant	Makes sense. That's a part of the whole "not monotonous" thing
2016-06-24 22:30:04	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-24 22:30:39	En_Passant	Next question?
2016-06-24 22:30:47	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-24 22:31:45	En_Passant	Opportunities for advancement
2016-06-24 22:32:00	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-24 22:32:05	@Espyo	well
2016-06-24 22:32:22	@Espyo	like most places, you start off barely knowing the code to the project
2016-06-24 22:32:31	@Espyo	and can evolve to the point where you're the new team leader of the coding department
2016-06-24 22:32:40	@Espyo	or you can start your own department, if the company also grows and needs to split further
2016-06-24 22:32:47	@Espyo	so that is pretty simple in and of itself
2016-06-24 22:33:22	@Espyo	I'm not sure on the details, but I'm guessing that if you find yourself good enough, and your team leader agrees, you can arrange with Human Resources to get you to step up in your career
2016-06-24 22:33:28	@Espyo	a position of more power, but more responsibility
2016-06-24 22:33:41	@Espyo	in the concrete case of my company, we don't need to split out coding department
2016-06-24 22:33:51	@Espyo	and our boss is so high above the curve that nobody's really getting close to replacing him
2016-06-24 22:33:53	@Espyo	however
2016-06-24 22:34:05	@Espyo	there are a lot of side-tasks that pop up every once in a while
2016-06-24 22:34:14	@Espyo	for instance, something that's been happening a few times lately
2016-06-24 22:34:15	@Espyo	is requests for feature sets
2016-06-24 22:34:22	@Espyo	instead of adding a lone feature for 3 days and calling it quits
2016-06-24 22:34:35	@Espyo	the product department decides the games would be better with this, that, and that feature
2016-06-24 22:34:40	@Espyo	and you get a small group of people to work on it
2016-06-24 22:34:48	@Espyo	if you're good enough, the team leader can entrust you to lead this group
2016-06-24 22:35:08	@Espyo	I've only been here for a year and a half, and yet I was already entrusted to lead two feature sets
2016-06-24 22:35:25	@Espyo	both of which, I was working with a less experienced coworker on the coding department
2016-06-24 22:35:49	@Espyo	although that's won't raise your salary most of the time, it does help you improve as a leader
2016-06-24 22:35:54	@Espyo	and improve your skills, and ego, if you will
2016-06-24 22:36:03	@Espyo	which could open new doors in the future
2016-06-24 22:36:12	@Espyo	another thing is side-projects
2016-06-24 22:36:43	@Espyo	some months back, one of my department's coworkers decided to start a knowledge sharing ability to the company
2016-06-24 22:36:54	@Espyo	where volunteers could pick a subject and teach other volunteers about it
2016-06-24 22:37:27	@Espyo	like, if one of us thinks they're good at [[w:regular expressions]] and think other people in the company could do with learning that
2016-06-24 22:37:28	Testyo	"w:regular_expressions" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=w:regular_expressions
2016-06-24 22:37:33	@Espyo	they can set up a knowledge sharing session
2016-06-24 22:37:39	@Espyo	which can take place during work hours
2016-06-24 22:37:47	@Espyo	in my company's case, it doesn't even need to be work-related
2016-06-24 22:37:59	@Espyo	the second knowledge sharing session we had was on Street Fighter tech
2016-06-24 22:38:10	@Espyo	dunno if that one was during work hours, I'm guessing not
2016-06-24 22:38:14	@Espyo	but yeah, thing is
2016-06-24 22:38:22	@Espyo	you can also grow a bit by doing these
2016-06-24 22:38:27	En_Passant	{{w|regular_expressions}}
2016-06-24 22:38:27	Testyo	"w|regular_expressions" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:w|regular_expressions
2016-06-24 22:38:37	@Espyo	(won't work)
2016-06-24 22:38:45	@Espyo	me and the guy that started the knowledge sharing movement had a session on code conventions
2016-06-24 22:38:56	@Espyo	to try to get the company to use cleaner, more conventional code
2016-06-24 22:39:08	@Espyo	(the fact that everybody writes code their own way REALLY hinders one's ability to understand a given piece of code)
2016-06-24 22:39:34	@Espyo	(sometimes it's as simple as some lines being "a=1+1" and others being "a = 1 + 1")
2016-06-24 22:39:50	@Espyo	(others involve completely different ways of organizing memory structures and instructions)
2016-06-24 22:40:01	@Espyo	me doing that helped me in quite a few ways
2016-06-24 22:40:05	@Espyo	helped me help the company
2016-06-24 22:40:12	@Espyo	helped me get better at public speaking
2016-06-24 22:40:17	@Espyo	etc.
2016-06-24 22:40:35	@Espyo	but, in a more concrete way, it is possible to advance your career monetarily without many internal changes
2016-06-24 22:40:36	@Espyo	at least in my company
2016-06-24 22:40:47	@Espyo	by working there, you gradually get your salary raised if you're performing all right
2016-06-24 22:41:11	@Espyo	oh, one of the guys at the company that used to work on the "lowly" quality control department
2016-06-24 22:41:18	@Espyo	got "upgraded" to working on the product department
2016-06-24 22:41:29	@Espyo	I'm putting these in quotes, because in a company, all cogs are necessary to get the machine running
2016-06-24 22:41:33	@Espyo	so not one department is better than another
2016-06-24 22:41:42	@Espyo	but truth is, quality control doesn't require much skill
2016-06-24 22:41:56	@Espyo	whereas the product department requires knowing what's best for the players of the games
2016-06-24 22:41:58	@Espyo	which is important
2016-06-24 22:42:10	@Espyo	but yeah, he just figured he had what it takes, and applied for the position
2016-06-24 22:42:13	@Espyo	and got moved
2016-06-24 22:42:26	@Espyo	this is a bit of a company-by-company scenario, though
2016-06-24 22:42:31	@Espyo	some companies could never accept a move like that
2016-06-24 22:42:38	@Espyo	while others can easily get people to work on whatever they want
2016-06-24 22:42:47	@Espyo	and to what degree a shift is different from an upgrade is debatable
2016-06-24 22:42:54	@Espyo	that's about it
2016-06-24 22:42:56	Yoshi2	this went quite beyond the scope of an interview
2016-06-24 22:43:06	@Espyo	this is like a podcast now
2016-06-24 22:43:31	@Espyo	I'm getting the idea that you'll want to understand how my work is with this interview, and have good material to write the final thing
2016-06-24 22:43:33	@Espyo	that's why I'm so verbose
2016-06-24 22:43:38	@Espyo	but then again, I HAVE to be verbose
2016-06-24 22:43:42	@Espyo	I can't let some of the things I said go unsaid
2016-06-24 22:43:57	En_Passant	It's valuable information
2016-06-24 22:44:03	@Espyo	otherwise I'll just stick with "yeah, you can advance your career" and call it a day, and I'll get messy
2016-06-24 22:44:05	@Espyo	good to hear!
2016-06-24 22:44:16	Yoshi2	with such vague questions, you do have to be verbose
2016-06-24 22:44:22	En_Passant	I don't need to write an essay on it, but it's good advice just to have going forward
2016-06-24 22:44:27	@Espyo	true
2016-06-24 22:44:32	@Espyo	right
2016-06-24 22:44:52	En_Passant	But yeah, they literally shoved the entire interview into a one-sentence run-on prompt
2016-06-24 22:45:03	En_Passant	And a large box to put stuff in
2016-06-24 22:45:23	@Espyo	eep
2016-06-24 22:45:28	Yoshi2	if it was a more involved, the person interviewing you could ask additional questions based on stuff you said
2016-06-24 22:45:37	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-06-24 22:45:58	Testyo	ALDUT GOY OWIMAH FANBOI CHANNEL ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ
2016-06-24 22:46:21	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-06-24 22:46:54	Yoshi2|offline	good comment, Testyo 
2016-06-24 22:46:55	Testyo	that's over 90% of them
2016-06-24 22:47:58	En_Passant	Last question, which I saved until the end because it's weird:
2016-06-24 22:48:12	En_Passant	What sorts of personality traits are/aren't compatible with the job?
2016-06-24 22:48:55	@Espyo	personality...
2016-06-24 22:48:58	@Espyo	skills is one thing
2016-06-24 22:49:00	@Espyo	personality is another
2016-06-24 22:49:09	@Espyo	well, being a good team-worker is a great thing to have
2016-06-24 22:49:15	@Espyo	regardless of department
2016-06-24 22:49:27	@Espyo	on some companies where you like assemble pieces on an assembly line
2016-06-24 22:49:29	@Espyo	that seriously doesn't matter
2016-06-24 22:49:39	@Espyo	but here, you can't help but communicate and work with your partners several times a day
2016-06-24 22:49:48	@Espyo	if you're not good at doing that, your work may suffer
2016-06-24 22:50:09	@Espyo	like I said way before, since this job is the way it is in the common world
2016-06-24 22:50:12	@Espyo	most companies are pretty casual
2016-06-24 22:50:25	@Espyo	and as such, I'd dare say having a good sense of humour and being nice to people is also important
2016-06-24 22:50:37	@Espyo	our department might be a bit over the top
2016-06-24 22:50:43	@Espyo	it's notorious for never shutting up
2016-06-24 22:50:53	@Espyo	we're always cracking jokes and spitting swears
2016-06-24 22:51:08	@Espyo	but it really helps go through the day, it really does
2016-06-24 22:51:22	@Espyo	not all companies will appreciate the "chatter instead of work" approach, though
2016-06-24 22:51:39	@Espyo	and it IS important to understand when it's okay to chat and laugh, and when you need to work
2016-06-24 22:51:49	@Espyo	you can do both at once, and managing the levels is also important
2016-06-24 22:52:15	@Espyo	being eager to learn is also important, if you can call that a personality trait
2016-06-24 22:52:21	@Espyo	even though it doesn't have to be very strong
2016-06-24 22:52:38	@Espyo	for me, I'd be comfortable spending 20+ years of my life on the same job, on the same position, just fixing bugs and adding features
2016-06-24 22:53:00	@Espyo	and yet, I pursed the (optional) knowledge sharing thing by my own accord
2016-06-24 22:53:05	@Espyo	plus other small things here and there
2016-06-24 22:53:12	@Espyo	that made me just want to learn more and be more helpful
2016-06-24 22:53:20	@Espyo	so in a way, I guess it comes naturally
2016-06-24 22:53:36	@Espyo	although having the will to improve, whether it comes naturally later or not, is also important
2016-06-24 22:53:42	@Espyo	I think that'd be all for personalities...
2016-06-24 22:53:50	@Espyo	(well, personality TRAITS)
2016-06-24 22:54:15	@Espyo	you asked compatible and incompatible, but I think I explained why each one is good for the job, and not good for another job
2016-06-24 22:54:26	@Espyo	so I guess that it's possible to extrapolate which traits aren't good
2016-06-24 22:54:38	@Espyo	being a loner, being a jerk, being boring
2016-06-24 22:54:39	En_Passant	yeah
2016-06-24 22:55:45	En_Passant	I better keep my sarcasm in check
2016-06-24 22:56:29	@Espyo	hey, depends on the company
2016-06-24 22:56:38	@Espyo	me and my boss shoot the occasional banter to one another
2016-06-24 22:56:50	@Espyo	so if I can be sassy with my own boss... yeah, that just shows how some places can REALLY take a joke
2016-06-24 23:02:17	@Espyo	okay, I think I messed with Wine in ways I shouldn't have
2016-06-24 23:02:17	En_Passant	Well, thanks for your time, and to your fingers for sacrificing themselves to a noble cause
2016-06-24 23:02:19	@Espyo	so I'll restart my computer
2016-06-24 23:02:22	@Espyo	you're welcome
2016-06-24 23:02:28	@Espyo	and yeah, I noticed my fingers started getting sore...
2016-06-24 23:02:32	@Espyo	which is weird, since I can code for hours on end
2016-06-24 23:02:52	En_Passant	Coding involves mouse, too, doesn't it?
2016-06-24 23:04:45	@Espyo	well, the process of writing the code itself doesn't
2016-06-24 23:04:56	@Espyo	but you switch your hands from the keyboard to the mouse several times throughout the day, sure
2016-06-24 23:05:07	@Espyo	like, after you write code on a file, you want to save the file
2016-06-24 23:05:14	@Espyo	you can either Ctrl+S or click the save icon
2016-06-24 23:05:19	@Espyo	same for running your compiled program

2016-06-25 00:10:07	@PikFan	wow
2016-06-25 00:10:46	@PikFan	...oh, so THAT'S what that weird brown stuff is in the Oak
2016-06-25 00:10:50	@PikFan	it's freaking water
2016-06-25 00:11:07	@PikFan	make a video of the flooded Oak, that's awesome
2016-06-25 00:13:38	@Espyo	wat
2016-06-25 00:13:43	@Espyo	what brown stuff
2016-06-25 00:13:46	@Espyo	you mean in my images, right?
2016-06-25 00:13:49	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-25 00:13:52	@Espyo	is there any brown stuff in the vanilla game I'm missing?
2016-06-25 00:13:53	@PikFan	the weird brown layer
2016-06-25 00:13:56	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-06-25 00:13:56	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-25 00:14:22	@Espyo	yeah, guess it's tough because I never explained
2016-06-25 00:14:26	@Espyo	yeah, I plopped water
2016-06-25 00:14:27	@PikFan	reminds me of Scruffy's flooded Awakening Wood
2016-06-25 00:14:32	@Espyo	notice how it's muddy and brown
2016-06-25 00:14:36	@Espyo	there's no data on the water itself to do that
2016-06-25 00:14:45	@PikFan	mhm?
2016-06-25 00:16:11	@Espyo	so how does the game know to make it muddy and opaque?
2016-06-25 00:16:16	@Espyo	shouldn't it be, like, normal?
2016-06-25 00:17:10	@PikFan	sure, but there's probably some hidden detail
2016-06-25 00:17:33	@PikFan	maybe... the game knows how deep the water is
2016-06-25 00:17:38	@PikFan	or how much land the water covers
2016-06-25 00:20:33	@Espyo	maybe, but I find it a bit hard to believe
2016-06-25 00:20:42	@Espyo	actually, let me check what the other hacker did
2016-06-25 00:20:48	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/user/MKWB13/videos
2016-06-25 00:20:54	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqVj0Rw44E
2016-06-25 00:21:09	@Espyo	it's kinda transparent and bluey
2016-06-25 00:24:23	@Espyo	waaaait
2016-06-25 00:24:27	@Espyo	might depend on the water block I copied
2016-06-25 00:26:04	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-06-25 00:26:11	@PikFan	is each water block different?
2016-06-25 00:27:04	@Espyo	it might
2016-06-25 00:27:21	@Espyo	 1 "water_plane_mud" 
2016-06-25 00:27:26	@Espyo	is one of the lines on this "water block"
2016-06-25 00:27:34	@Espyo	funny how I instantly described it as "muddy"
2016-06-25 00:27:40	@Espyo	and this value has the word "mud" in it
2016-06-25 00:27:41	@Espyo	so...
2016-06-25 00:27:45	@Espyo	lemme check others
2016-06-25 00:28:43	@Espyo	yeaaaaaah
2016-06-25 00:28:44	@Espyo	that's likely it
2016-06-25 00:28:53	@Espyo	 1 "water_plane_deep" 
2016-06-25 00:29:02	@Espyo	and most water boxes don't even have this value
2016-06-25 00:29:12	@PikFan	...interesting
2016-06-25 00:30:54	@PikFan	16:07:02	Espyo	heh, any success?
2016-06-25 00:31:08	@PikFan	well, one of them is having a hard time figuring out their Wii U's IP address
2016-06-25 00:31:13	@Espyo	pfft
2016-06-25 00:35:40	@PikFan	...she was in the SYSTEM settings, not the INTERNET BROWSER settings
2016-06-25 00:35:43	@PikFan	oh dear...

2016-06-25 01:18:41	@Espyo	ok, so I spawned DebugActor
2016-06-25 01:18:43	@Espyo	and it's weird
2016-06-25 01:18:45	@Espyo	it's invisible
2016-06-25 01:18:52	@Espyo	and it's like a wall pushing me around and moving in a circle

2016-06-25 01:21:59	@PikFan	yeah, that is weird
2016-06-25 01:22:41	@PikFan	so my friend couldn't get TCPGecko to work
2016-06-25 01:22:56	@PikFan	it seemed like she was doing everything correctly, but it wasn't working
2016-06-25 01:23:04	@PikFan	maybe it's just her Wii U
2016-06-25 01:23:13	@PikFan	cause TCPGecko worked just fine on mine
2016-06-25 01:26:49	@Espyo	well, you really need to follow the step
2016-06-25 01:26:50	@Espyo	*s
2016-06-25 01:27:00	@Espyo	the first time I tried, I accessed the browser from the PAUSE menu
2016-06-25 01:27:03	@Espyo	and not from the home menu
2016-06-25 01:27:06	@Espyo	that ruined it

2016-06-25 01:28:41	@Espyo	that weird object is invisible
2016-06-25 01:28:43	@Espyo	and I can't lock-on to it
2016-06-25 01:28:47	@Espyo	so at first I figured there was nothing there
2016-06-25 01:28:55	@Espyo	and then suddenly Alph just gets tossed aside by an invisible force

2016-06-25 01:29:24	@Espyo	going out-of-bounds and such is fun

2016-06-25 12:57:03	Yoshi2	things way off in the water are just there, sometimes it is stuff like objective markers which are moved to other places using scripts

2016-06-25 12:57:14	@Espyo	oh

2016-06-25 12:57:28	@Espyo	the fact that there's another enemy out of bounds
2016-06-25 12:57:31	@Espyo	I think I've figured it out
2016-06-25 12:57:32	Yoshi2	sometimes it is passengers of vehicles which are automatically put into vehicles at the start of the level so it doesn't matter where they are
2016-06-25 12:57:44	@Espyo	regardless of where you place the Plasm Wraith and the Mysterious Life Form
2016-06-25 12:57:59	@Espyo	when the cutscene starts, the MLF is forced to be placed on the exit of the oak
2016-06-25 12:58:04	@Espyo	where it creeps for a bit, and when it explodes
2016-06-25 12:58:10	@Espyo	it's forced to be placed way out of bounds
2016-06-25 12:58:15	@Espyo	and the Plasm Wraith is forced to be put in its place
2016-06-25 12:58:20	@Espyo	where the cutscene continues and the fight starts
2016-06-25 12:58:33	@Espyo	so that enemy out of bounds is simply the MLF, and there's no way to control where it's placed
2016-06-25 12:58:43	@Espyo	when the game simply doesn't need it any more for the cutscene, it places it really far away
2016-06-25 12:58:55	@Espyo	it's just that with a glitch to get free control over the radar, you can scroll really far and see it
2016-06-25 12:59:12	@Espyo	although, regardless, me and a friend got the (frame perfect?) glitch to happen, but couldn't see the icon
2016-06-25 12:59:19	@J	I do love moving things off-screen or OoB just to hide them
2016-06-25 12:59:27	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 12:59:34	@Espyo	when you first learn about this trick, you become sick
2016-06-25 12:59:37	@Espyo	how could the devs DO this?
2016-06-25 12:59:40	@Espyo	and then you just do it all the time
2016-06-25 12:59:50	@Espyo	on the engine, I haven't quite done it so far, except for one thing
2016-06-25 12:59:53	@Espyo	HUD elements are customizable
2016-06-25 13:00:11	@Espyo	and HUD elements you don't want, like the number of Pikmin in total (Pikmin 3 doesn't use this), you can just slap them off-camera
2016-06-25 13:00:25	@J	on websites too
2016-06-25 13:00:27	@Espyo	feels naughty, but why bother coding in a way to hide them if they're off-camera?
2016-06-25 13:00:33	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-06-25 13:00:42	@Espyo	I guess so, though getting CSS to cooperate that way isn't as fun
2016-06-25 13:00:49	Yoshi2	a lot of flash games draw beyond what you can actually see
2016-06-25 13:01:29	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-25 13:01:32	Yoshi2	and then there is the fun part of how pikmin has hud elements that you don't see
2016-06-25 13:01:38	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-06-25 13:01:48	@Espyo	still need to explore Pikmin 2 better
2016-06-25 13:01:56	@J	I've seen it used often for drop-down-on-hover menus on websites

2016-06-25 13:02:33	@Espyo	oh yeah, now that you mention it
2016-06-25 13:02:34	@Espyo	sounds familiar
2016-06-25 13:03:53	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-06-25 13:16:24	@Espyo	oh, Dave showed me this yesterday http://firsthour.net/first-hour-review/pikmin
2016-06-25 13:16:35	@Espyo	interesting stuff, but one of the images piqued my interest
2016-06-25 13:16:44	@Espyo	http://firsthour.net/screenshots/pikmin/pikmin-carrying-spaceship-part.jpg
2016-06-25 13:16:49	@Espyo	I've never seen that one before
2016-06-25 13:17:12	Yoshi2	pre-release screenshot?
2016-06-25 13:17:28	Marty2000	Yeah, I was going to post the screenshot
2016-06-25 13:17:42	Marty2000	It would be interesting to have it on Pikipedia
2016-06-25 13:17:52	Marty2000	Let's search for it on Google...
2016-06-25 13:18:02	Marty2000	We have it

2016-06-25 13:18:26	Marty2000	Pikipedia was one of the results :p
2016-06-25 13:19:22	Marty2000	And it's an unused file
2016-06-25 13:20:41	@Espyo	...
2016-06-25 13:20:46	@Espyo	that's kinda sad, in a way
2016-06-25 13:20:49	@Espyo	well, time to make use of it

2016-06-25 13:21:14	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yep, pre-release. the biggest thing about it is the piece the Pikmin are carrying, which looks like part of a washing machine or something dumb
2016-06-25 13:21:20	@Espyo	in the final game, the [[Main Engine]] looks much cooler and sci-fi

2016-06-25 13:45:37	Marty2000	Ah, Espyo, about the mistake I mentioned on Friday, could you see it in the files of the game?
2016-06-25 14:08:51	@Espyo	oh, I never remembered
2016-06-25 14:08:54	@Espyo	what was it exactly?
2016-06-25 14:08:57	Marty2000	No problem
2016-06-25 14:08:59	@Espyo	this time, I'll add it to my todo
2016-06-25 14:09:58	Marty2000	A mistake in the Five-man Napsack 's French description (America only, no mistake in the other versions or even in Europe): they say you have to press + to lie down
2016-06-25 14:10:06	Marty2000	I wrote down the notes, if you want
2016-06-25 14:10:30	Marty2000	Also, I wrote down the notes for the Wii version (English) since they are slightly different
2016-06-25 14:16:58	@Espyo	right, right
2016-06-25 14:17:21	@Espyo	yeah, you can as well add the Wii version's notes

2016-06-25 14:17:51	@Espyo	and then create a [[Notes:Five-man Napsack/shipwii]] with the NPC notes

2016-06-25 14:17:54	@Espyo	I THINK that should be enough

2016-06-25 14:18:10	@Espyo	there should be like |ship=y
2016-06-25 14:18:21	@Espyo	change it to |shipgc=y |shipwii=y
2016-06-25 14:18:27	Marty2000	Oh, yeah, but I don't have the ship's notes, though... 
2016-06-25 14:18:33	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-25 14:18:37	@Espyo	then, what notes change?
2016-06-25 14:18:40	Marty2000	Only Olimar's description
2016-06-25 14:18:44	@Espyo	ooooohhh
2016-06-25 14:18:45	@Espyo	right, right
2016-06-25 14:18:47	@Espyo	well, same thing
2016-06-25 14:18:51	Marty2000	But I can get them
2016-06-25 14:18:54	@Espyo	except instead of "ship", it's "journal" :P
2016-06-25 14:18:57	@Espyo	I'll take care of it
2016-06-25 14:19:01	Marty2000	Ok
2016-06-25 14:19:02	@Espyo	since I'll already be opening the files
2016-06-25 14:19:09	Marty2000	Olimar's notes are the same, but X is replaced with C
2016-06-25 14:19:32	@Espyo	is that what you meant by "slightly different"?
2016-06-25 14:19:43	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 14:19:53	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-25 14:21:02	@Espyo	well, it works
2016-06-25 14:21:12	@Espyo	I'm wondering if we should do the same for other Exploration Kit treasures
2016-06-25 14:21:25	@Espyo	either have one description, and on the part where it says "hold X", replace it with "hold X/C"
2016-06-25 14:21:34	@Espyo	or if we should have one description per version, with the only change being the button
2016-06-25 14:21:37	Marty2000	Yeah, that would be better
2016-06-25 14:21:53	Marty2000	Unlike the French versions, English do not change between America and Europe too
2016-06-25 14:22:09	Marty2000	I tried to play the game in French, and even the ship's dialogs are different between the two versions
2016-06-25 14:23:07	Marty2000	I don 't think it's the case for the Spanish versions, though
2016-06-25 14:23:11	Marty2000	don't*
2016-06-25 14:24:20	@Espyo	right
2016-06-25 14:26:14	@Espyo	eeeehh...
2016-06-25 14:26:22	@Espyo	it's kinda hard to tell what button is on the game's strings
2016-06-25 14:26:29	@Espyo	since you get "remember to press"
2016-06-25 14:26:38	@Espyo	followed by 18 garbage characters

2016-06-25 15:47:48	@Espyo	wtf
2016-06-25 15:47:56	@Espyo	who made "Emergence Cave" italicized on that image?
2016-06-25 15:48:16	Marty2000	Ah, that must be me :p Didn't see that
2016-06-25 15:48:21	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-25 15:48:30	@Espyo	looks really weird <_>
2016-06-25 15:48:38	@Espyo	well, honestly, I don't know which one would be best
2016-06-25 15:49:00	Marty2000	Maybe the third one? Even see you cannot really tell where it is ...
2016-06-25 15:49:11	Marty2000	But on the other images, you can barely see the name
2016-06-25 15:49:20	Marty2000	Even though they show better where it is 
2016-06-25 15:49:47	@Espyo	I guess that having an image that shows the entrance, but from afar, would work well
2016-06-25 15:49:56	@Espyo	we have to think about the reader
2016-06-25 15:50:05	@Espyo	imagine it's somebody who wants to find the entrance to a cave, but doesn't know where it is
2016-06-25 15:50:15	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Shower_Room#How_to_reach Like this, but even  further?
2016-06-25 15:50:15	@Espyo	I guess the Emergence Cave is pretty easy, but Bulblax Kingdom is a bit tricky
2016-06-25 15:50:23	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 15:50:24	@Espyo	it doesn't even look like you can reach where the Bulblax Kingdom is, at first
2016-06-25 15:50:35	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-06-25 15:50:43	@Espyo	I think the best idea would be to have the text indicate where the player needs to go
2016-06-25 15:50:49	@Espyo	and then an image showing the surroundings
2016-06-25 15:51:03	@Espyo	when the player starts getting near the area, they'll compare their surroundings with the image
2016-06-25 15:51:06	@Espyo	and know that that's the spot
2016-06-25 15:51:21	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 15:51:27	@Espyo	though if it's too far away from the cave, it DOES show a good amount of surroundings, but may make it hard to find the cave on the image...
2016-06-25 15:51:33	@Espyo	I guess some common sense must be employed
2016-06-25 15:51:43	Marty2000	I'll try to take a screenshot of the Shower Room to see if it goes well with the text
2016-06-25 15:51:50	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-25 15:56:54	Marty2000	I've taken 3 screenshots, I'll upload them somewhere and you can tell me which one you prefer (I reall try to avoid images with HUD on them because I don't like that to be honest)
2016-06-25 15:57:50	@Espyo	hehe, all right
2016-06-25 15:58:00	@Espyo	though if cropping the HUD out robs detail, I'd much prefer we kept the HUD in
2016-06-25 15:58:39	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466866622-shower-room-1.jpg You see around the cave but the latter itself is hard to see...
2016-06-25 15:58:41	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466866623-shower-room-2.jpg The best screenshot for me.
2016-06-25 15:58:47	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466866623-shower-room-3.jpg You see the cave better at the cost of not seeing the bridge.
2016-06-25 15:59:06	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-25 15:59:10	@Espyo	what zoom level was this taken in?
2016-06-25 15:59:21	Marty2000	The furthest
2016-06-25 15:59:56	@Espyo	I guess they looked better in my head
2016-06-25 16:00:01	@Espyo	hm, maybe try an overhead view?
2016-06-25 16:00:25	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 16:00:34	Marty2000	(with the furthest view too?)
2016-06-25 16:02:20	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466866928-shower-room-4.jpgEspyo: doesn't seem better in my opinion.
2016-06-25 16:02:35	Marty2000	Oop
2016-06-25 16:02:36	Marty2000	Oops
2016-06-25 16:02:38	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/25/1466866928-shower-room-4.jpg
2016-06-25 16:02:44	Marty2000	Better :p
2016-06-25 16:03:20	Marty2000	My last option is to enable moon jump to get a screenshot from high, if you want
2016-06-25 16:03:31	@Espyo	ugh...
2016-06-25 16:03:34	@Espyo	no, no hacks
2016-06-25 16:03:40	@Espyo	we're better off going with a sketch or something, in that case
2016-06-25 16:03:44	Marty2000	Yeah, that's why I said my last option :p
2016-06-25 16:03:46	@Espyo	also, moon jump?
2016-06-25 16:03:51	@Espyo	what, on Dolphin?
2016-06-25 16:03:54	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-25 16:03:57	@Espyo	I could never get moon jump to work on Dolphin
2016-06-25 16:04:01	@Espyo	EU or US?
2016-06-25 16:04:03	Marty2000	There's moon jump on the American version (only)
2016-06-25 16:04:11	Marty2000	Doesn't work on the EU version
2016-06-25 16:04:19	@Espyo	how do you active it?
2016-06-25 16:04:22	@Espyo	you just do it?
2016-06-25 16:04:26	@Espyo	or do you need to activate another code too?
2016-06-25 16:04:31	Marty2000	Just that code
2016-06-25 16:04:40	@Espyo	really weird
2016-06-25 16:04:43	Marty2000	Maybe we don't have the same too... wait

2016-06-25 16:05:16	Marty2000	Moon Jump (L+A)
2016-06-25 16:05:53	@Espyo	?
2016-06-25 16:05:55	@Espyo	I don't even HAVE it
2016-06-25 16:05:56	@Espyo	what
2016-06-25 16:06:31	@Espyo	well, I'll add it and try
2016-06-25 16:06:35	Marty2000	Just go in Properties, AR Codes, and enter it
2016-06-25 16:06:41	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 16:07:24	@Espyo	oh, it works
2016-06-25 16:07:25	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-06-25 16:07:40	Marty2000	No problem
2016-06-25 16:10:05	@Espyo	sigh, dunno what to do about the cave entrance images
2016-06-25 16:10:49	Marty2000	Concerning images for treasures: I know you find it useless to have images of a treasure's spawpoint in a cave... like this http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/1e/Stupendous_Lens.jpg
2016-06-25 16:10:53	Marty2000	Still, I think they're kind of useful because they show better the environment in which you find the treasure, or their kind of spawpoint (dead end, for example). Plus, http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Collectible_article_policy#Gallery 
2016-06-25 16:11:02	Marty2000	For treasures in caves, a screenshot of any potential spawn point will do.
2016-06-25 16:11:14	Marty2000	Well, that's not as important as the images for entrances, right now
2016-06-25 16:13:23	@Espyo	well, that's only applicable to treasures that spawn in dead ends
2016-06-25 16:13:27	@Espyo	and even then, any dead end looks the same
2016-06-25 16:13:29	@Espyo	so it wouldn't add any value
2016-06-25 16:13:45	@Espyo	we already have over 10 thousand images, we need to start being more selective about the things we do and don't upload...
2016-06-25 16:14:00	Marty2000	Oh, that number? I see then
2016-06-25 16:15:23	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Pages_that_need_images Yeah, I think we have to clear out this list by adding images to the articles, first
2016-06-25 16:15:48	Marty2000	This is what I've been trying to do, but the entrances to caves is quite hard...
2016-06-25 16:15:55	@Espyo	I think it's something like that

2016-06-25 16:36:45	@Espyo	I have some queued up Fire Emblem posts to make
2016-06-25 16:36:52	@Espyo	if I don't post them, I won't be able to queue another
2016-06-25 16:36:58	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 16:37:01	@Espyo	see, on the 3DS, if you're offline, you can store a Miiverse postt
2016-06-25 16:37:03	@Espyo	*post

2016-06-25 16:37:25	Marty2000	Ah, yeah
2016-06-25 16:37:29	@Espyo	I've reminded myself that I need to do it like 5 times this week

2016-06-25 16:56:32	@Espyo	he specifically said did what he was told not to
2016-06-25 16:56:36	@Espyo	but, it's not a bad edit
2016-06-25 16:56:45	@Espyo	the second he does a bad image-related edit, that's it
2016-06-25 16:56:59	@Espyo	for now... I guess we can pretend he didn't do anything, since this IS helping the wiki
2016-06-25 16:57:07	Marty2000	Oh yea, I know. It just made me laugh before he keeps editing stuff related to images :p
2016-06-25 16:57:09	Marty2000	yeah*

2016-06-25 17:03:51	Marty2000	I guess they just have a lot of wrong information
2016-06-25 17:03:54	@Espyo	in other news, the sky is blue
2016-06-25 17:04:49	Marty2000	I see :p
2016-06-25 17:05:14	@Espyo	were you around yesterday when I said I was trying to understand the Pikmin 3 "DebugActor" object?
2016-06-25 17:05:28	Marty2000	No, I couldn't connect yesterday
2016-06-25 17:05:59	Marty2000	What is it?
2016-06-25 17:06:14	@Espyo	oh, weird
2016-06-25 17:06:19	@Espyo	anyway, that's just it, I don't know :P
2016-06-25 17:06:24	@Espyo	it's invisible, and I can't lock-on to it
2016-06-25 17:06:25	Yoshi2	DebugActor?
2016-06-25 17:06:25	@Espyo	but...
2016-06-25 17:06:29	@Espyo	I randomly get pushed about
2016-06-25 17:06:30	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-25 17:06:33	@Espyo	or debug_actor
2016-06-25 17:06:35	@Espyo	it's... weird
2016-06-25 17:06:48	@Espyo	the game calls enemies with a lowercase underscore naming scheme, on the "enemy" folder
2016-06-25 17:07:00	@Espyo	but then when you spawn them in-game, they have a TitleCase scheme with no underscores
2016-06-25 17:07:07	@Espyo	anyway yeah, it could be anything
2016-06-25 17:07:13	@Espyo	and I just can't understand the pattern behind the pushing behavior
2016-06-25 17:07:14	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 17:07:16	@Espyo	well, I'll make a video
2016-06-25 17:08:06	Marty2000	Yeah, good idea
2016-06-25 17:13:27	-->	Scruffy (Mibbit@179-777-1-60.lightspeed.chtnsc.sbcglobal.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-25 17:13:31	Scruffy	Hello everybody!
2016-06-25 17:13:33	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-25 17:13:42	Yoshi2	hey Scruffy 
2016-06-25 17:13:46	Scruffy	Two interesting occurrences in Pikmin 2 today
2016-06-25 17:13:50	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-06-25 17:14:29	Scruffy	First, we know that if you enter a cave and convert all Pikmin of a primary type using Candypop Buds, when you leave the ship will mistakenly give you the "extinction yesterday" dialogue
2016-06-25 17:14:51	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-06-25 17:14:51	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 17:14:54	@Espyo	hi Scruffy
2016-06-25 17:14:57	Scruffy	hi
2016-06-25 17:15:08	Scruffy	But if you skip the cutscene where you land from the geyser
2016-06-25 17:15:29	Scruffy	The Pikmin who exited the cave don't land until after the extinction dialogue
2016-06-25 17:15:49	Scruffy	So the Onion spouts a seed, the ship talks, and then all your other Pikmin fall from the sky
2016-06-25 17:15:52	Marty2000	Oh, nice
2016-06-25 17:15:52	@Espyo	huh
2016-06-25 17:16:13	Marty2000	The same happens with the "White Pikmin" or "Purple Pikmin" in ship cutscenes
2016-06-25 17:16:33	Marty2000	(when the ship tells you how to withdraw them)
2016-06-25 17:16:39	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-25 17:16:44	Scruffy	heh, it was pretty amusing
2016-06-25 17:17:07	Scruffy	The other thing was that I had one White Pikmin building the shortcut bridge in the Perplexing Pool on day 4
2016-06-25 17:17:20	Scruffy	I chose to end the day with it still working, and it got left behind
2016-06-25 17:17:25	Scruffy	But no enemies came out to eat it
2016-06-25 17:17:37	Scruffy	It just sat there in the space between all three Onions

2016-06-25 17:18:05	Scruffy	I thought that was odd
2016-06-25 17:18:12	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-06-25 17:18:22	@Espyo	hm, that is weird
2016-06-25 17:18:29	Scruffy	It still counted though
2016-06-25 17:18:39	@Espyo	what the hell that image
2016-06-25 17:18:58	Scruffy	I guess someone wanted to show what the Progg would look like with 4 legs?
2016-06-25 17:19:06	@Espyo	guess so
2016-06-25 17:19:10	Marty2000	Yeah, ha ha

2016-06-25 17:37:07	@Espyo	oh, I should've checked what happens if you have Pikmin dragged by it
2016-06-25 17:37:10	@Espyo	may help explain what's up
2016-06-25 17:43:08	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] File:Super Mario Sunshine... by Marty (+10) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=14044&diff=167854
2016-06-25 17:43:30	@Espyo	ok, yeah
2016-06-25 17:43:35	@Espyo	I need to reupload with the Pikmin
2016-06-25 17:43:39	@Espyo	it's not good enough with just a leader
2016-06-25 17:43:47	@Espyo	you can understand it a bit better with Pikmin
2016-06-25 17:48:10	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] File:WUPP Pikmin3 Ev05 sc... by Marty (+45) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=8168&diff=167855
2016-06-25 17:49:15	Scruffy	Oh, I noticed that when you dismiss Pikmin in Pikmin 2, there's a certain amount of time that they can't rejoin you're group by bumping into them
2016-06-25 17:49:27	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-25 17:49:55	Marty2000	Oh, Espyo, about the "Good day jingle" thing, since we know it doesn't play from 2000 Pokos but 1400 Pokos (probably under), would you like me to find the exact number of Pokos that triggers it?
2016-06-25 17:49:56	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 17:50:46	@Espyo	yes please
2016-06-25 17:50:49	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 17:50:56	@Espyo	I would adore to put this mystery to rest once and for all
2016-06-25 17:51:03	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-25 17:51:13	@Espyo	because nobody knows, and a lot of places are speculating it
2016-06-25 17:51:29	@Espyo	when I had to add the "happy" version of the song that goes unused in Pikmin 3 to the TCRF article
2016-06-25 17:51:31	@Espyo	I used the info we had at the time
2016-06-25 17:51:34	@Espyo	which is apparently, wrong
2016-06-25 17:51:47	@Espyo	there might be other places out there that say the song is triggered with X or Y, when it's actually Z
2016-06-25 17:51:54	@Espyo	I do wonder though: is it ONLY the poko count that matters?
2016-06-25 17:52:07	Marty2000	Yeah, that's what I should test
2016-06-25 17:52:11	@Espyo	I've heard different theories — the number of treasures you get, number of Pokos, number of deaths...
2016-06-25 17:52:37	Marty2000	Though, I have to restart another save,so it might take some time (I mean, I won't get the answer in two minutes)
2016-06-25 17:53:06	Marty2000	Probably in an hour or two
2016-06-25 17:53:15	@Espyo	right
2016-06-25 17:53:29	@Espyo	...on the video upload screen, I get two warnings that the audio might be desynched or in an unknown format
2016-06-25 17:53:34	@Espyo	...THERE'S NO AUDIO
2016-06-25 17:53:39	Scruffy	Those usually don't matter anyway
2016-06-25 17:53:44	@Espyo	did they seriously not add a check for the case where the video doesn't have audio?
2016-06-25 17:53:45	Scruffy	I think that's a warning for all videos
2016-06-25 17:54:09	@Espyo	what's more, these warnings are trying to link to a page, but instead of getting a clickable link, you get the raw <a href="http://youtube.com/whatever">link</a>
2016-06-25 17:54:17	Marty2000	Scruffy: indeed, same for my videos
2016-06-25 17:54:20	@Espyo	I refuse to believe youtube's devs use the site
2016-06-25 17:54:22	Marty2000	I ALWAYS get a warning
2016-06-25 17:54:28	@Espyo	and I know for a fact they almost always ignore public outcry
2016-06-25 17:54:32	@Espyo	this seriously wouldn't be hard to fix
2016-06-25 17:54:43	@Espyo	and yet, according to you two, it's something that's been happening everywhere, and for quite a bit now
2016-06-25 17:54:46	@Espyo	youtube's such a joke...
2016-06-25 17:55:01	@Espyo	it pains me so much because when I develop stuff, I try my best to polish everything and make it as least frustrating and confusing as possible
2016-06-25 17:55:17	@Espyo	and then these amateurs put the minimum amount of effort possible into a horrible piece of software
2016-06-25 17:55:35	@Espyo	and work on the most popular website in the history of humanity
2016-06-25 17:55:43	Marty2000	Oh, miracle! I copied a save sometime ago in which I hadn't retrieved any treasure on the Wistful Wild... this won't take much time
2016-06-25 17:55:49	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-06-25 17:55:55	@Espyo	plus, the Wistful Wild has the richest treasures
2016-06-25 17:56:08	Marty2000	Yeah, so I can see if it's the number of treasures or else
2016-06-25 17:56:13	Marty2000	(Pokos amount)
2016-06-25 17:56:34	@Espyo	ANYWAY... here's the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpkbEaDOzE
2016-06-25 17:56:42	@Espyo	with just Alph, it was really hard to understand its shape and behavior
2016-06-25 17:56:44	Scruffy	You should also try a save in which you only collect beasts
2016-06-25 17:56:47	@Espyo	but with the Pikmin, it's much clearer
2016-06-25 17:56:52	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that too
2016-06-25 17:56:58	@Espyo	but can you really get 1000 Pokos worth of enemies in a single day?
2016-06-25 17:57:02	@Espyo	[[Emergence Cave run]]
2016-06-25 17:57:02	Testyo	"Emergence_Cave_run" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Emergence_Cave_run
2016-06-25 17:57:10	@Espyo	according to that, even if  you do your best, you still need like 16 days
2016-06-25 17:57:17	@Espyo	(going off of memory here)
2016-06-25 17:57:24	Marty2000	Weird
2016-06-25 17:57:33	Scruffy	Hmmm
2016-06-25 17:58:11	Scruffy	Well if you continuously go in the Cavern of Chaos, you should be able to rack up quite a few Pokos
2016-06-25 17:58:18	Marty2000	There's a cave with a treasure that's worth 1000 Pokos
2016-06-25 17:58:24	Scruffy	also that's an interesting object
2016-06-25 17:58:40	Marty2000	If you don't recover any treasure, you have the bad day jingle (even with pokos earned from enemies)
2016-06-25 17:59:13	Marty2000	[[Hole of Heroes]]
2016-06-25 17:59:13	Testyo	"Hole_of_Heroes" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Hole_of_Heroes
2016-06-25 17:59:15	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-06-25 17:59:29	@Espyo	I guess you can reach 1000 Pokos in enemies on the Wistful Wild
2016-06-25 17:59:33	@Espyo	but not on the Emergence Cave
2016-06-25 17:59:36	@Espyo	with its 10 or so enemies
2016-06-25 17:59:37	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-25 17:59:38	@Espyo	completely forgot about that
2016-06-25 17:59:52	@Espyo	well, at the least, you can try getting like 800 Pokos with enemies, and the remaining 200 with treasures
2016-06-25 17:59:57	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Hole_of_Heroes#Sublevel_4 This treasure is worth 1000 Pokos
2016-06-25 17:59:58	--	UltraMartyMcFly is now known as UltraMarop
2016-06-25 18:00:02	@Espyo	I honestly doubt the game would make it so you don't get the song if you only used enemi...
2016-06-25 18:00:03	--	UltraMarop is now known as UltraMario
2016-06-25 18:00:03	@Espyo	...
2016-06-25 18:00:07	@Espyo	this is Pikmin 2 we're talking about
2016-06-25 18:00:09	@Espyo	maybe it does
2016-06-25 18:00:24	Marty2000	Did you see what I said?
2016-06-25 18:00:25	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-25 18:00:38	Marty2000	If you don't recover any treasure, you have the bad day jingle (even with pokos earned from enemies)
2016-06-25 18:00:48	@Espyo	oh, I...
2016-06-25 18:00:50	@Espyo	I didn't
2016-06-25 18:00:50	@Espyo	sorry
2016-06-25 18:00:55	@Espyo	right, makes sense
2016-06-25 18:01:03	Marty2000	I know it because in my main save, I have tried to recover more than 1000 Pokos with the Hole of Heroes once
2016-06-25 18:01:08	@Espyo	so if you get a dinky treasure, and get like 2000 Pokos worth of enemies
2016-06-25 18:01:10	Marty2000	No problem
2016-06-25 18:01:11	@Espyo	you get the happy song
2016-06-25 18:01:19	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-25 18:01:21	Marty2000	... I don't know :/
2016-06-25 18:01:27	@Espyo	probably
2016-06-25 18:01:34	Marty2000	This is worth trying
2016-06-25 18:01:39	Marty2000	First, let's get the golden treasure
2016-06-25 18:01:45	Marty2000	I have to unlock the path to the cave
2016-06-25 18:01:48	@Espyo	if no treasures collected today
2016-06-25 18:01:51	@Espyo	then sad song
2016-06-25 18:01:58	@Espyo	else if pokos gotten today is over 1000
2016-06-25 18:01:59	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 18:02:00	@Espyo	then happy song
2016-06-25 18:02:02	@Espyo	else normal song
2016-06-25 18:02:06	Marty2000	That's what I think
2016-06-25 18:02:13	@Espyo	yeah :)
2016-06-25 18:04:29	@Espyo	ok, time to spawn a Dragonball
2016-06-25 18:05:47	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 18:06:24	Yoshi2	by now my editor has a few voodoo things abstracted away for my own pleasure
2016-06-25 18:06:53	@Espyo	hm, looks like it failed to load
2016-06-25 18:06:56	@Espyo	Yoshi2: hmm?
2016-06-25 18:07:46	Yoshi2	stuff like conversion of BW coordinates into coordinates for drawing on a plane and back
2016-06-25 18:08:00	@Espyo	oooh, nice
2016-06-25 18:08:05	@Espyo	but highly needed, too
2016-06-25 18:08:58	Yoshi2	once I cracked the save/load system of a warcraft custom map so that I could create my own save codes
2016-06-25 18:09:13	Yoshi2	and by cracked I meant I stole the save/load code and ported it 1:1 to python
2016-06-25 18:09:37	Yoshi2	later hid it behind some neatly named functions
2016-06-25 18:09:50	Yoshi2	and never looked at the save/load code ever again
2016-06-25 18:10:05	Yoshi2	suprisingly works
2016-06-25 18:10:28	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-25 18:10:35	@Espyo	until one day it won't
2016-06-25 18:10:37	@Espyo	and you'll cry
2016-06-25 18:10:57	Yoshi2	somehow, that day never came
2016-06-25 18:10:59	Scruffy	debug_actor... could it be an object to test physics?
2016-06-25 18:11:08	Yoshi2	whenever there was a problem with it, it was a user error
2016-06-25 18:11:33	@Espyo	seems that way
2016-06-25 18:12:28	@Espyo	pfffffft
2016-06-25 18:12:30	Scruffy	Or perhaps for testing how the Pikmin formation is now "waxy"
2016-06-25 18:12:32	@Espyo	so I spawned a "ufo"
2016-06-25 18:12:45	@Espyo	which, according to my notes, is the Hocotate ship
2016-06-25 18:12:49	@Espyo	but it turns out it's the Drake
2016-06-25 18:12:53	Scruffy	Woah
2016-06-25 18:12:56	@Espyo	and I spawned it on a Mission Mode map alongside the SPERO
2016-06-25 18:12:59	Scruffy	In Pikmin 2 it is the Hocotate Ship
2016-06-25 18:13:00	@Espyo	and the game is just okay with this
2016-06-25 18:13:02	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-25 18:13:08	@Espyo	what's more, I tried delivering a cherry
2016-06-25 18:13:12	@Espyo	the Pikmin delivered it to the Drake
2016-06-25 18:13:15	@Espyo	and the Drake just accepted it
2016-06-25 18:13:18	@Espyo	and added the score just fine
2016-06-25 18:13:22	Scruffy	Poor SPERO :(
2016-06-25 18:13:30	@Espyo	it's so good when the game doesn't explode just because one thing is slightly off
2016-06-25 18:13:39	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-25 18:13:41	Yoshi2	well written software
2016-06-25 18:13:50	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-25 18:13:51	@Espyo	uh
2016-06-25 18:13:57	@Espyo	but according to my notes, "ship_obj" is the Drake
2016-06-25 18:14:42	@Espyo	only one thing to it — let's see what ship_obj is
2016-06-25 18:15:15	@Espyo	nothing, didn't load
2016-06-25 18:15:51	--	UltraMario is now known as UltraMario|Nap
2016-06-25 18:17:03	@Espyo	time for "ukikusa"
2016-06-25 18:17:42	@Espyo	just a pile of leaves
2016-06-25 18:18:30	Scruffy	A plant or a hiding spot?
2016-06-25 18:18:41	@Espyo	seems like a plant
2016-06-25 18:19:19	@Espyo	seems like it could be used to decorate oob parts
2016-06-25 18:19:50	Marty2000	Espyo: retrieving the treasure (that's worth 1000 Pkos) and ending the day didn't trigger the good day jingle, just the normal one... :(
2016-06-25 18:19:56	Marty2000	Pokos
2016-06-25 18:20:12	@Espyo	 1001? :|
2016-06-25 18:20:41	Marty2000	Let's see what happens if I collect another treasure in another cave
2016-06-25 18:20:54	Marty2000	(to have more than 1000 Pokos)
2016-06-25 18:21:52	Marty2000	If it still doesn't work after some tries, I'll try to recover the Doomsday Apparatus
2016-06-25 18:22:10	@Espyo	oh, I spawned clay_station!
2016-06-25 18:22:20	@Espyo	which is a pile of bridge fragments, except it's blobs of clay instead
2016-06-25 18:22:25	@Espyo	I can lock-on, no name
2016-06-25 18:22:31	Marty2000	Nice
2016-06-25 18:22:41	@Espyo	time to get Pikmin to work on it
2016-06-25 18:22:44	@Espyo	and likely crash the game
2016-06-25 18:22:55	@Espyo	bingo
2016-06-25 18:23:01	@Espyo	the Pikmin taps away at it
2016-06-25 18:23:10	@Espyo	and when the "fragment" was meant to appear on the Pikmin's hand
2016-06-25 18:23:12	@Espyo	boom, crash
2016-06-25 18:23:17	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 18:23:32	Marty2000	Recovered the Enamel Buster
2016-06-25 18:23:50	Scruffy	Blobs of clay...
2016-06-25 18:24:03	Scruffy	Maybe that was what became hay?
2016-06-25 18:24:07	@Espyo	maybe
2016-06-25 18:24:27	Scruffy	Personally, around here, I'd sooner find clay than hay
2016-06-25 18:24:33	Scruffy	What does the lock-on say
2016-06-25 18:24:41	Scruffy	Oh
2016-06-25 18:24:54	Scruffy	Sorry, didn't see you already said no name :P
2016-06-25 18:25:44	@Espyo	can't really find many more unused or unknown objects to toy with
2016-06-25 18:25:51	Yoshi2	no tank model?
2016-06-25 18:26:02	Yoshi2	sensya something
2016-06-25 18:26:02	Marty2000	Still nothing about the Jingle... :(
2016-06-25 18:26:06	@Espyo	lolno
2016-06-25 18:26:09	Marty2000	So it's not related to the amount of Pokos
2016-06-25 18:26:14	@Espyo	damn, Marty
2016-06-25 18:26:15	Marty2000	(probably)
2016-06-25 18:26:18	@Espyo	maybe number of treasures, then?
2016-06-25 18:26:34	Marty2000	I'll see what I can come up with
2016-06-25 18:26:40	Marty2000	I'll try as many things as I can
2016-06-25 18:27:18	Scruffy	I could try spawning the Titan Dweevil treasures all in one area to see if that works
2016-06-25 18:27:24	Scruffy	4 treasures, 1200 Pokos
2016-06-25 18:27:26	Scruffy	Wait
2016-06-25 18:27:33	Scruffy	4 treasures, 12000 Pokos
2016-06-25 18:28:18	Marty2000	It will likely not work, but you can still try
2016-06-25 18:31:19	Marty2000	Here's what I'm going to try:
2016-06-25 18:31:28	Marty2000	-Retrieve all the treasure of the Submerged Castle
2016-06-25 18:31:59	Marty2000	-Same except for the Professional Noisemaker
2016-06-25 18:32:41	Marty2000	If they don't trigger the jingle:
2016-06-25 18:32:53	Marty2000	-Retrieve all the treasures of the Submerged Castle but the Noisemaker, exit the cave, end the day, and retrieve the Noisemaker on the next one
2016-06-25 18:33:16	@Espyo	right
2016-06-25 18:33:54	Scruffy	Actually, I can just change the Poko value of any treasure
2016-06-25 18:34:01	Scruffy	I'll try that
2016-06-25 18:34:23	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-06-25 18:34:27	@Espyo	try one worth 4000 Pokos
2016-06-25 18:34:32	@Espyo	 5000 for a nice round number
2016-06-25 18:37:13	@Espyo	ok, I can spawn "nest"
2016-06-25 18:37:18	@Espyo	it's simply the P2 Hermit Crawmad nest
2016-06-25 18:37:21	@Espyo	no collisions
2016-06-25 18:37:25	@Espyo	nothing special about it
2016-06-25 18:39:19	Scruffy	Okay, 5000 Poko Courage Reactor did not trigger the happy song
2016-06-25 18:39:52	@Espyo	darn
2016-06-25 18:40:11	Scruffy	My guess is it's the number of treasures you collect
2016-06-25 18:40:19	Scruffy	Maybe if it's over 10 or 15 or something
2016-06-25 18:40:23	Marty2000	My guess it's whether you complete a cave or not
2016-06-25 18:40:34	Marty2000	(except for the Emergence Cave)
2016-06-25 18:41:11	Marty2000	Maybe you're right, we'll see soon anyway. I'm trying various things...
2016-06-25 18:41:18	Scruffy	Heh, it still tells me the next day "50% of debt recovered"
2016-06-25 18:41:28	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-25 18:41:32	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-25 18:44:04	@Espyo	hm, I can spawn a single warp point
2016-06-25 18:44:06	@Espyo	and the game is okay with it
2016-06-25 18:44:14	@Espyo	I can't go through from one side of the object, but I can from the other
2016-06-25 18:44:18	@Espyo	also, if I tap it on the radar, nothing happens
2016-06-25 18:44:21	@Espyo	no crash or anything
2016-06-25 18:46:10	Marty2000	In the Tropical Wilds, where you find the raspberry, there is two entrances to the cave where you find it
2016-06-25 18:46:19	Marty2000	There's one that you cannot use once you are in the cave
2016-06-25 18:46:22	Marty2000	It's too high
2016-06-25 18:46:29	Marty2000	So maybe it's also used in-game
2016-06-25 18:47:30	@Espyo	hm, maybe
2016-06-25 18:49:42	@Espyo	ok, spawned SlopeClay
2016-06-25 18:49:48	@Espyo	it's this small ramp made of clay
2016-06-25 18:49:54	@Espyo	but I can't climb up on either side
2016-06-25 18:49:58	@Espyo	it's just solid like a wall
2016-06-25 18:50:02	Scruffy	And the mail has already skipped to the President on the run from debt collectors
2016-06-25 18:50:09	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-25 18:50:16	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 18:51:30	Marty2000	Recovered all treasures but the Noisemaker... let's see what happens
2016-06-25 18:51:43	Marty2000	I don't have the jingle
2016-06-25 18:52:03	@Espyo	hm, test_block is a tiny wall
2016-06-25 18:52:08	@Espyo	around half the size of a Pikin
2016-06-25 18:52:10	@Espyo	*Pikmin
2016-06-25 18:52:13	Scruffy	How cute
2016-06-25 18:52:15	@Espyo	but its object radius is pretty big
2016-06-25 18:52:22	@Espyo	it pushes me from a bit far away
2016-06-25 18:52:30	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 18:52:31	@Espyo	like the size of two Red Bulborbs
2016-06-25 18:52:40	@Espyo	it also moves back and forth like debug_actor, but much slower
2016-06-25 18:53:25	@Espyo	and now for test_box
2016-06-25 18:54:24	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-06-25 18:54:26	@Espyo	a simple test cube
2016-06-25 18:54:31	@Espyo	around half Alph's size
2016-06-25 18:54:38	@Espyo	I can throw Pikmin on top of it, and that's about it
2016-06-25 18:55:01	Scruffy	Is it any color?
2016-06-25 18:55:16	@Espyo	generic gray-and-white checkerboard
2016-06-25 18:55:48	@Espyo	https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_3#test_box
2016-06-25 18:56:29	@Espyo	ok, now to spawn fruits
2016-06-25 18:56:59	@Espyo	by which I mean BDama
2016-06-25 18:57:01	@Espyo	a weird marble
2016-06-25 18:57:30	@Espyo	it's a yellow marble
2016-06-25 18:57:35	@Espyo	if you lock-on, it says Marble
2016-06-25 18:57:40	@Espyo	are there yellow marbles in Bingo Battle?
2016-06-25 18:57:45	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 18:57:46	Scruffy	Yes
2016-06-25 18:57:53	Scruffy	They act the same as red and blue
2016-06-25 18:57:56	@Espyo	oh, yeah, I remember now
2016-06-25 18:58:14	@Espyo	well, the SPERO took it
2016-06-25 18:58:18	@Espyo	but I got no points for it :(
2016-06-25 18:58:28	Scruffy	No Piktamin U :o
2016-06-25 18:58:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-25 18:58:41	@Espyo	let me try a Victory Macaroon
2016-06-25 18:59:24	<--	Testyo (Testyo@37.189.nry.mz) has quit (*.net *.split)
2016-06-25 18:59:54	@Espyo	no points either
2016-06-25 18:59:56	@Espyo	stingy :/
2016-06-25 18:59:59	@Espyo	what the? Testyo?
2016-06-25 19:00:10	@Espyo	ah, netsplit
2016-06-25 19:00:14	Marty2000	I wonder what would happen if you spawned Purple/White Pikmin/Candypop Buds in Story Mode
2016-06-25 19:00:23	@Espyo	hm, good question
2016-06-25 19:00:25	Marty2000	Bye Testyo
2016-06-25 19:00:26	@Espyo	I'll try later
2016-06-25 19:00:31	@Espyo	but it might act normal
2016-06-25 19:00:31	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 19:00:48	Marty2000	To see what would happen with the Master Onion too
2016-06-25 19:00:56	Scruffy	Okay, I completed the Hole of Beasts only
2016-06-25 19:00:57	@Espyo	ok, gonna try spawning the unused "exploration kit" treasures
2016-06-25 19:00:58	Marty2000	(since you never have them with the Master Onion)
2016-06-25 19:00:58	Scruffy	1102 Pokos
2016-06-25 19:01:10	Scruffy	And didn't get the happy song
2016-06-25 19:01:13	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 19:01:23	Marty2000	I mighave another idea... let me see
2016-06-25 19:01:54	Marty2000	might*
2016-06-25 19:02:04	@Espyo	didn't spawn anything
2016-06-25 19:02:07	Marty2000	Also, didn't get the song by completing the S. Castle
2016-06-25 19:02:24	Scruffy	It must be the number of treasures collected in a day
2016-06-25 19:02:45	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-25 19:02:54	@Espyo	see why I really want this to be solved?
2016-06-25 19:02:57	@Espyo	it's such an elusive mystery
2016-06-25 19:03:24	@Espyo	boo, none of the unused upgrades spawn
2016-06-25 19:03:42	@Espyo	might only be because I'm in Mission Mode
2016-06-25 19:03:51	@Espyo	so I'll try to spawn the Metal Suit Z
2016-06-25 19:04:36	@Espyo	they won't spawn
2016-06-25 19:05:15	@Espyo	ok, gonna try spawning a "gas" geyser
2016-06-25 19:05:18	@Espyo	and see how that ends up
2016-06-25 19:05:26	@Espyo	then I'll go to story mode and try Whites/Purples, and the upgrades
2016-06-25 19:09:19	Scruffy	Meanwhile I'm going to try to see what "particletype," "numparticles," and "particlesize" control with P2 treasures
2016-06-25 19:09:51	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-06-25 19:09:53	Scruffy	Most of the treasures seem to have "simple" particle types with 8 particles of size 1
2016-06-25 19:10:11	@Espyo	what "poof" particles to spawn when the treasure is delivered?
2016-06-25 19:10:21	Scruffy	But some, like the Lustrous Element, have "complex" particles
2016-06-25 19:10:28	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-06-25 19:10:30	Scruffy	And quite a few have fewer than 8
2016-06-25 19:10:58	Scruffy	Possessed Squash has particle size 16
2016-06-25 19:11:05	Scruffy	I'm getting to the bottom of this

2016-06-25 19:12:50	CraftedPbody	I'm writing a page for my electric water dumple right now.
2016-06-25 19:13:04	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-06-25 19:13:09	CraftedPbody	I'm working on Olimar's notes
2016-06-25 19:13:16	Marty2000	Hi
2016-06-25 19:13:24	CraftedPbody	"This grub-dog generates electricity in it's electroplaque cells in which it uses to paralyze both predator and prey alike. Their breeding habits are unknown since it's rare for them to group together on account of their territorial nature"
2016-06-25 19:13:49	@Espyo	hm, nice
2016-06-25 19:13:54	@Espyo	though *its electroplaque
2016-06-25 19:14:10	Scruffy	Very well done
2016-06-25 19:14:25	CraftedPbody	thanks espyo
2016-06-25 19:14:33	Scruffy	Only suggestion: try not to end it in two dependent conclusive clauses
2016-06-25 19:14:54	Scruffy	Maybe "...since their territorial nature makes group sightings rare"
2016-06-25 19:15:09	@Espyo	ah, I get what you mean
2016-06-25 19:15:13	@Espyo	"X because Y because Z"
2016-06-25 19:15:18	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-25 19:16:07	CraftedPbody	"This grub-dog generates electricity in its electroplaque cells in which it uses to paralyze both predator and prey alike. Their breeding habits are unknown as their territorial nature makes group sightings rare."
2016-06-25 19:16:13	CraftedPbody	there, how's that?
2016-06-25 19:16:17	Scruffy	Perfect
2016-06-25 19:16:25	@Espyo	nice
2016-06-25 19:16:53	@Espyo	nope, gas or bubble geysers don't work
2016-06-25 19:17:24	CraftedPbody	Now Louie's notes
2016-06-25 19:17:54	CraftedPbody	Oh, also I have an idea for what the unused bubble geyser's would have done. I don't think they spewed water.
2016-06-25 19:18:37	CraftedPbody	I think bubble geysers literally produced the bubble hazard. they were probably going to be used underwater.
2016-06-25 19:18:45	@Espyo	hmmmmm...
2016-06-25 19:18:47	@Espyo	yeah, maybe
2016-06-25 19:19:10	CraftedPbody	Otherwise it would probably say water
2016-06-25 19:19:20	CraftedPbody	instead of bubble
2016-06-25 19:19:57	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-25 19:20:03	Scruffy	perhaps the developers found it either too annoying or that the bubbles didn't behave like underwater air bubbles
2016-06-25 19:20:04	CraftedPbody	which would be an interesting obstacle, to say the least
2016-06-25 19:20:28	CraftedPbody	I'm willing to bet on the former
2016-06-25 19:20:50	CraftedPbody	they aren't as sadistic as they used to be.
2016-06-25 19:20:57	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-25 19:21:13	Scruffy	I'll make up for it in this hack I'm working on
2016-06-25 19:22:17	Scruffy	Woah, 800 particles on the Courage Reactor and the Valley of Repose won't even load
2016-06-25 19:22:28	@Espyo	haha
2016-06-25 19:22:30	@Espyo	as opposed to what?
2016-06-25 19:22:35	Scruffy	8
2016-06-25 19:22:39	Scruffy	but let me try 80
2016-06-25 19:22:41	@Espyo	eeesh...
2016-06-25 19:22:42	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-25 19:23:58	CraftedPbody	even their sadistic ideas in Pikmin 3 weren't very sadistic. The three orange bulborbs in the twilight river are easily bypassed with wing pikmin, the hoard of Dwarf orange bulborbs aren't even that dangerous of a trap... like seriously... what happened to good ol' sadistic nintendo with the cave of pain?
2016-06-25 19:24:29	CraftedPbody	or the bulblax kingdom for that matter
2016-06-25 19:25:34	@Espyo	hehe yeah
2016-06-25 19:25:40	Scruffy	I don't know about you but I found Clockwork Chasm to laugh at me pretty hard
2016-06-25 19:25:53	@Espyo	hm, yeah...
2016-06-25 19:25:59	@Espyo	you need to really get your head in the game to get good at that stage
2016-06-25 19:26:13	@Espyo	...or just cheese it out in two-player like me and my friend did at Manchester
2016-06-25 19:26:18	@Espyo	no plan, just improvised
2016-06-25 19:26:25	@Espyo	two-player mode is so easy, you don't even need a plan
2016-06-25 19:27:17	CraftedPbody	Well, they saved the hard stuff for mission mode...
2016-06-25 19:27:45	Yoshi2	2p mission mode is quite a thing
2016-06-25 19:27:46	Scruffy	That's true
2016-06-25 19:28:00	@Espyo	just noticed that the reflection of the loading screen's text in Pikmin 3 is wrong
2016-06-25 19:28:04	@Espyo	Tropical Wilds
2016-06-25 19:28:08	@Espyo	the p goes through the "ground"
2016-06-25 19:28:32	@Espyo	ok, editing objects in in story mode is super hard
2016-06-25 19:28:41	@Espyo	the game keeps a tab of every enemy inside the save data
2016-06-25 19:28:45	@Espyo	and apparently the reinforced walls too
2016-06-25 19:29:01	@Espyo	can't really think of anything to replace that a) the save data won't mess with, and b) that I can know what it is for the purpose of replacing it
2016-06-25 19:29:14	@Espyo	...or I can just spawn something right next to the Drake
2016-06-25 19:29:16	@Espyo	hmm, if it works
2016-06-25 19:30:17	@Espyo	plus I'm a bit burned out from doing this
2016-06-25 19:30:22	@Espyo	need to rest and do something else
2016-06-25 19:30:36	@Espyo	feeling the freedom of plopping objects wherever I want REALLY makes me want to work on the engine, so

2016-06-25 19:32:27	Scruffy	Hmm, I wonder

2016-06-25 19:32:56	Yoshi2	hi CraftedPbody 
2016-06-25 19:33:27	Scruffy	pikicountmax and pikicountmin are the maximum/minimum amount of Pikmin received for recovering a pellet/carcass
2016-06-25 19:34:10	Scruffy	Sleeping Olimar is listed in the carcass config, so could he possibly give you Pikmin if his pikicountmax and min were set to something???
2016-06-25 19:35:07	CraftedPbody	so, I'm curious do any of you have ideas for how Louie might cook an electric water dumple?
2016-06-25 19:35:36	Scruffy	He'd probably say to drain the electricity first
2016-06-25 19:36:15	Scruffy	Or perhaps he could just tell you that you can cook it but don't reheat it in a microwave
2016-06-25 19:38:39	CraftedPbody	I'm thinking he'd probably say something relating to the barbels that it uses to zap the pikmin.
2016-06-25 19:39:14	CraftedPbody	Either to use them to cook/power the cooking device or to cut them off
2016-06-25 19:39:37	Scruffy	Hah, I like the former, using them to power a cooking device
2016-06-25 19:40:06	CraftedPbody	"Perfect poweroutage food
2016-06-25 19:40:16	CraftedPbody	"*
2016-06-25 19:42:53	@Espyo	"DEPT"?!
2016-06-25 19:42:56	@Espyo	hah!
2016-06-25 19:43:02	CraftedPbody	"No power? No problem! Simply attach jumper cables to the barbels and to your portable stove and slow cook to crispy perfection."
2016-06-25 19:43:09	@Espyo	Scruffy: it's actually not
2016-06-25 19:43:16	@Espyo	the carrier numbers don't add up
2016-06-25 19:43:22	@Espyo	...or am I thinking of Pikmin 3?
2016-06-25 19:43:28	Marty2000	It's in the European Gamecube version
2016-06-25 19:43:28	@Espyo	I think I'm thinking of P2
2016-06-25 19:43:58	@Espyo	oh, wait
2016-06-25 19:44:02	@Espyo	I thought those were the carrier numbers
2016-06-25 19:44:07	@Espyo	but you're telling me they're the seed numbers
2016-06-25 19:44:08	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-25 19:46:38	Scruffy	carrier numbers are just "min" and "max"
2016-06-25 19:46:48	Scruffy	"pikicountmin" and "pikicountmax" are the seeds
2016-06-25 19:47:33	@Espyo	right
2016-06-25 19:49:58	@Espyo	uhm
2016-06-25 19:50:05	@Espyo	Marty2000: the game files have that sentence written as "Debt"
2016-06-25 19:50:15	@Espyo	what's more, I can't find that string on the US version's English script
2016-06-25 19:50:25	Marty2000	Ah...
2016-06-25 19:51:47	@Espyo	oh, and the Wii European version calls it "Results up to Debt Repayment"
2016-06-25 19:52:10	Marty2000	This screenshot was taken on Dolphin, if it helps
2016-06-25 19:52:22	@Espyo	hmmm, that could be the problem
2016-06-25 19:52:54	Scruffy	NO. WAY.
2016-06-25 19:53:06	@Espyo	it worked?!
2016-06-25 19:53:07	Scruffy	Olimar lying down produces 4 Pikmin

2016-06-25 19:53:18	Marty2000	Wow
2016-06-25 19:53:25	Scruffy	Nope
2016-06-25 19:53:29	Scruffy	I can do it again and again
2016-06-25 19:53:45	Marty2000	It's amazing
2016-06-25 19:54:00	Scruffy	I also set "money" to 4, in a sec I'll test if he does Pokos too
2016-06-25 19:54:12	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-25 19:55:08	Marty2000	By the way, you can have over one million of Pokos, the game still shows the right number on the counter... heh

2016-06-25 19:56:53	@Espyo	Marty2000: can you add to your todo, tha the next time you repay the debt on the GameCube, you should check if the typo is there?
2016-06-25 19:57:03	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 19:57:11	@Espyo	because I seriously can't find a problem...
2016-06-25 19:57:13	Marty2000	(I can only try on Dolphin, though, since I have no Gamecube)
2016-06-25 19:57:22	@Espyo	oh, damn
2016-06-25 19:57:23	@Espyo	that's right
2016-06-25 19:57:32	@Espyo	it'd be best to check this on a real GC, though...
2016-06-25 19:57:34	Marty2000	But...
2016-06-25 19:57:40	@Espyo	...or watch a video :P
2016-06-25 19:57:40	Marty2000	I can check Youtube videos.
2016-06-25 19:57:44	@Espyo	yeah, heh
2016-06-25 19:57:45	Marty2000	Same idea
2016-06-25 19:59:50	Marty2000	Ok, retrieving 5 treasures on the Perplexing Pool and clearing the Submerged Castle activates the jingle... but what really triggers it...? :p
2016-06-25 20:00:31	Marty2000	Maybe it's the number of treasures... woder if it's 15? (I retrieved 18 treasuresà
2016-06-25 20:00:33	Marty2000	wonder*
2016-06-25 20:00:46	@Espyo	it might be
2016-06-25 20:01:08	Marty2000	Those 18 treasures earned me 1100 Pokos
2016-06-25 20:02:09	Marty2000	I'll try to see what happens with 14 treasures and then 15

2016-06-25 20:16:41	Scruffy	So Olimar also coughs up 4 Pokos when you bring him to the ship
2016-06-25 20:16:53	Scruffy	But he also doesn't cause the "storing carcasses" cutscene to play
2016-06-25 20:17:47	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-25 20:17:52	@Espyo	yeah, only some enemies do, which is weird

2016-06-25 20:18:38	@Espyo	end of that video
2016-06-25 20:18:43	@Espyo	it does say "Dept" too...
2016-06-25 20:19:34	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-25 20:20:31	@Espyo	ok, here's what I'll try
2016-06-25 20:20:40	@Espyo	I'll try to change the string in the game's files
2016-06-25 20:20:51	@Espyo	if I change it, and use Dolphin to complete the debt, and the text is the same
2016-06-25 20:20:59	@Espyo	that means the text is hardcoded, and whoever wrote it messed up
2016-06-25 20:21:03	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Electric Water Dumple by CraftedPbody (-12) http://www.pikminfanon.com/?curid=10643&diff=53757
2016-06-25 20:21:14	@Espyo	if it changes according to what I do, then it's a problem with the font used to display that
2016-06-25 20:21:17	Marty2000	Or you can use AR and recover it too
2016-06-25 20:21:34	Marty2000	Oh, you wanna change the text too
2016-06-25 20:21:36	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 20:24:39	@Espyo	ok, US version also has this typo
2016-06-25 20:24:52	@Espyo	and the fact that I can't find the string on that version is a good indicator it's hardcoded
2016-06-25 20:25:27	Scruffy	It'd probably be in "new_screen
2016-06-25 20:25:39	Scruffy	under "eng"
2016-06-25 20:25:46	@Espyo	oh, hmm
2016-06-25 20:25:51	Scruffy	That appears to contain the hardcoded menus
2016-06-25 20:26:07	Scruffy	That's how I changed the text in the main menu
2016-06-25 20:26:16	Scruffy	I changed "Begin" to "Start"
2016-06-25 20:26:27	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-06-25 20:26:28	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-25 20:26:35	Scruffy	But that changed every instance of B, E, G, I, and N, to S, T, A, R, and T
2016-06-25 20:26:42	Scruffy	respectively
2016-06-25 20:26:47	@Espyo	:/
2016-06-25 20:26:52	Scruffy	so Bonuses became Sotusts
2016-06-25 20:26:59	Scruffy	Options became Optrots
2016-06-25 20:27:07	Scruffy	But it was so amusing I've kept it
2016-06-25 20:27:18	@Espyo	pfft
2016-06-25 20:27:54	Scruffy	you'll find the coding for it in the .blo files
2016-06-25 20:28:08	Scruffy	which reference the .bti texture files
2016-06-25 20:28:43	@Espyo	hm, okay
2016-06-25 20:29:13	Scruffy	I think .blo files are found in the folders called "SCRN"
2016-06-25 20:29:26	Scruffy	which you find in every .szs file
2016-06-25 20:34:49	@Espyo	that's it
2016-06-25 20:34:56	@Espyo	but I didn't choose the right "menu" file
2016-06-25 20:35:01	Scruffy	The titles are all groups of textures
2016-06-25 20:35:12	Scruffy	Yeah, I don't know which .szs handles the post-debt screen
2016-06-25 20:36:01	Scruffy	I looked in "worldmap.szs" however, and by changing the .blo file (which specifically spells out the .bti files it uses) I changed the positions of the background trees on the world map
2016-06-25 20:36:11	Scruffy	now the Wistful Wild is in front of all of them
2016-06-25 20:36:31	Scruffy	And the Awakening Wood background is under Perplexing Pool's spot
2016-06-25 20:36:38	CraftedPbody	... Still having that upload file problem... I just tried again... I'm going to mess around with the file and see if I can fix this on my side of the issue.
2016-06-25 20:37:19	@Espyo	might've found it
2016-06-25 20:37:23	@Espyo	result_final

2016-06-25 20:38:24	CraftedPbody	Ok, I fixed it.
2016-06-25 20:38:29	@Espyo	bleh, or this one is the file for the final results, not the debt repayment ones
2016-06-25 20:38:30	@Espyo	oh?
2016-06-25 20:38:38	CraftedPbody	For what ever reason, it didn't want a .png
2016-06-25 20:38:57	CraftedPbody	so I converted it into a jpg
2016-06-25 20:39:31	CraftedPbody	though the image suffered a tiny bit from this, but what can be done?
2016-06-25 20:39:33	@Espyo	yeah, but you lose the transparency that way...
2016-06-25 20:39:44	@Espyo	I'll have to take a look and report to Porple if needed
2016-06-25 20:40:19	CraftedPbody	luckily, the image had no transparency so that wasn't a problem.
2016-06-25 20:40:27	@Espyo	it didn't?
2016-06-25 20:40:30	@Espyo	the one Scruffy made for you?
2016-06-25 20:40:32	CraftedPbody	nope
2016-06-25 20:40:36	CraftedPbody	yeah
2016-06-25 20:40:47	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-06-25 20:40:50	@Espyo	I see it now
2016-06-25 20:40:52	@Espyo	it's on a sand backdrop
2016-06-25 20:40:56	@Espyo	well, okay, at least that fixes that
2016-06-25 20:40:58	CraftedPbody	yup
2016-06-25 20:41:01	@Espyo	but we still need to figure out the error

2016-06-25 20:42:47	Yoshi2	while you go have fun with pikmin modding, I'll go try a fun idea with terrain modding in bw

2016-06-25 20:48:14	Marty2000	Yeah, Scruffy
2016-06-25 20:48:22	Scruffy	I think that's a rule on Fanon, anyway

2016-06-25 20:49:44	Scruffy	But I don't have that ability on Fanon :P
2016-06-25 20:49:57	Marty2000	Wait, what is the rule you are talking about? I think there's a misunderstood :p
2016-06-25 20:50:14	Marty2000	misunderstanding*
2016-06-25 20:50:23	Marty2000	... which makes another misunderstanding :(
2016-06-25 20:50:26	Scruffy	The rule is that the only edits you can make to other creators' ideas is grammar corrections
2016-06-25 20:50:33	Marty2000	Ah, okay

2016-06-25 20:58:33	@Espyo	guess that's it, then!
2016-06-25 20:58:44	@Espyo	are you sure none of the treasures you collected have any special properties?
2016-06-25 20:58:49	@Espyo	like being a part of the exploration kit or whatever
2016-06-25 20:58:54	@Espyo	Scruffy: it doesn't exist
2016-06-25 20:59:01	Marty2000	None of them were part of the exploration kit
2016-06-25 20:59:05	@Espyo	I extracted all files and ran a search through all of them for "Dept"

2016-06-25 20:59:14	@Espyo	well, I should try "Debt"
2016-06-25 20:59:27	Scruffy	I don't think it would spell Dept or Debt specifically
2016-06-25 20:59:42	Scruffy	There would be a sequence of textures for letters
2016-06-25 21:00:03	Scruffy	I have no idea what they would call those textures, but since it's not the usual Pikmin font, it might not be normal
2016-06-25 21:00:17	@Espyo	oh...
2016-06-25 21:00:23	@Espyo	so, I pretty much have no way of finding out?
2016-06-25 21:00:39	Scruffy	Unless we scour them

2016-06-25 21:02:03	@Espyo	but finding the strings proper is no use
2016-06-25 21:02:31	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-25 21:02:49	Scruffy	You'd have to find a string of texture references that "spells" Dept or Debt
2016-06-25 21:03:10	@Espyo	I see what you mean

2016-06-25 21:03:34	Scruffy	If we could only know which .szs file it is, it would be much easier
2016-06-25 21:03:36	Marty2000	Apparently, he asked to be an admin some time ago
2016-06-25 21:03:55	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-25 21:04:04	Scruffy	but it has to be one of the "result" ones at least
2016-06-25 21:04:54	CraftedPbody	Well, he's really REALLY annoying.
2016-06-25 21:05:12	@Espyo	ok, I'm checking out how the title screen does it
2016-06-25 21:05:25	@Espyo	and I can see the textures, and I can see that the .blo file makes reference to them
2016-06-25 21:05:27	Scruffy	look in scrn
2016-06-25 21:05:30	@Espyo	yeha
2016-06-25 21:05:33	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-06-25 21:05:42	@Espyo	but from this, trying to find where a string is located, is futile
2016-06-25 21:05:46	Scruffy	in title_menu_6.blo
2016-06-25 21:06:11	@Espyo	yeah, they're there
2016-06-25 21:06:12	@Espyo	but then what?
2016-06-25 21:06:13	Scruffy	the first 5 .bti files called should spell "BEGIN:
2016-06-25 21:06:22	Scruffy	"BEGIN"*
2016-06-25 21:06:38	@Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2016-06-25 21:06:58	@Espyo	well, not quite
2016-06-25 21:07:05	@Espyo	B<weird L>EGIN
2016-06-25 21:07:13	Scruffy	oh, yeah
2016-06-25 21:07:17	Scruffy	navi_l.bti
2016-06-25 21:07:19	@Espyo	ok, my guess is that this part of the file tells the game to put the textures in memory, in this order
2016-06-25 21:07:21	Scruffy	I don't know what that is
2016-06-25 21:07:39	@Espyo	slot 0 is the texture with the B, slot 1 is...whatever navi_l.bti is, slot 2 is the texture with the E, etc.
2016-06-25 21:07:49	@Espyo	so somewhere in the file
2016-06-25 21:07:57	@Espyo	there must be a sequence of numbers that spell out BEGIN using these indexes
2016-06-25 21:08:04	@Espyo	and OPTIONS, and...
2016-06-25 21:08:06	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-25 21:08:25	Scruffy	So that's why I changed the names of these textures and that changed /every/ instance of them
2016-06-25 21:08:31	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-25 21:08:41	@Espyo	if we can find the sequence of numbers that refer to the textures
2016-06-25 21:08:44	@Espyo	we can find the actual "string"
2016-06-25 21:09:00	Scruffy	There's more crap at the end of the file
2016-06-25 21:09:46	Scruffy	But I can't make any sense of it
2016-06-25 21:10:48	@Espyo	nope, can't find anything at all
2016-06-25 21:11:02	@Espyo	with the logic we had, BEGIN would be 0, 2, 3, 4, 5

2016-06-25 21:11:19	@Espyo	either with raw numbers, or the bytes
2016-06-25 21:11:21	Scruffy	What is the whole string again?
2016-06-25 21:11:27	Scruffy	Results Prior to what?
2016-06-25 21:11:40	@Espyo	Results Prior to Repaying Debt
2016-06-25 21:11:43	@Espyo	or well, "Dept"
2016-06-25 21:11:53	Scruffy	result_final.szs is the one
2016-06-25 21:12:04	@Espyo	oh?
2016-06-25 21:12:05	CraftedPbody	I accidentally left-clicked on youtube rather than middle-clicking youtube 
2016-06-25 21:12:23	Scruffy	al_l_r_0.bti, al_l_e_0.bti, al_l_s_0.bti, al_l_u_0.bti,...
2016-06-25 21:12:32	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-06-25 21:12:38	Scruffy	It spells results and then begins to spell "prior"
2016-06-25 21:12:54	@Espyo	well, that works because it just so happens to be the order the devs decided to fill the array with
2016-06-25 21:13:05	@Espyo	makes sense to fill it with the "first" string's characters, yeah
2016-06-25 21:13:10	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-25 21:13:11	@Espyo	so, a bit of luck was involved in finding that
2016-06-25 21:13:14	@Espyo	but phew, it's found
2016-06-25 21:13:20	@Espyo	still, we don't know how the string is formed
2016-06-25 21:13:21	Scruffy	Human decency
2016-06-25 21:13:24	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-25 21:13:33	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-25 21:13:40	Scruffy	But we know there must be some mistake in it
2016-06-25 21:14:02	Scruffy	Wait, there are some numbers here
2016-06-25 21:14:09	Yoshi2	I'm really glad BW has been somewhat sane with strings compared to that
2016-06-25 21:14:17	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 is normally sane too
2016-06-25 21:14:20	@Espyo	unless it's strings in menus
2016-06-25 21:14:21	Scruffy	in the big space of nothing but ˇ
2016-06-25 21:14:23	@Espyo	where's just... THIS
2016-06-25 21:14:44	@Espyo	where's that? can't find it
2016-06-25 21:14:50	Marty2000	Give me an iso of a sane Pikmin 2, please
2016-06-25 21:14:57	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-25 21:15:08	@Espyo	well, "sane" Pikmin 2 means "insane game"
2016-06-25 21:15:08	Scruffy	Never mind, it isn't an index of anything
2016-06-25 21:15:14	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 21:15:15	@Espyo	"insane Pikmin 2" means "REALLY insane game"
2016-06-25 21:15:18	@Espyo	drat
2016-06-25 21:15:56	@Espyo	ok, so the textures are named with the scheme:
2016-06-25 21:16:04	@Espyo	al_<case>_<letter>_0.bti
2016-06-25 21:16:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-25 21:16:17	@Espyo	case is l for "large" (upper) and s for "small" (lower)
2016-06-25 21:16:19	Scruffy	In that file
2016-06-25 21:16:22	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-25 21:16:23	@Espyo	aaaaaand...
2016-06-25 21:16:28	@Espyo	there's no al_s_b_0.bti
2016-06-25 21:16:35	@Espyo	there's no texture for a lowercase b
2016-06-25 21:16:39	CraftedPbody	I'll be back in a bit... I'm going for a swim. if Logan edits my page while I'm away, please fix it for me.
2016-06-25 21:16:43	@Espyo	so, they couldn't spell out Debt
2016-06-25 21:16:50	@Espyo	will do, CraftedPbody
2016-06-25 21:16:55	@Espyo	nice, swimming
2016-06-25 21:17:08	@Espyo	I'm starting to think they had a specialized tool to create these menu files
2016-06-25 21:17:21	Scruffy	You're right!
2016-06-25 21:17:26	Scruffy	No b at all
2016-06-25 21:17:42	Marty2000	Heh, you two will have to explain everything on Pikipedia
2016-06-25 21:17:45	@Espyo	if the dev writes down "Repayment", the tool populates the array, fills in whatever it needs in the file, and places the textures needed on the timg folder
2016-06-25 21:17:47	Marty2000	COngrats!
2016-06-25 21:17:51	Marty2000	Congrats!*
2016-06-25 21:17:57	@Espyo	in this case, the dev wrote down "Dept"
2016-06-25 21:17:59	@Espyo	as well as other strings
2016-06-25 21:18:02	@Espyo	but never a lowercase b
2016-06-25 21:18:10	@Espyo	so the tool never placed the texture for the lowercase b on the timg folder
2016-06-25 21:18:34	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-25 21:18:41	@Espyo	it's unlikely that the dev wrote "Debt", but there's no texture for the b
2016-06-25 21:18:48	@Espyo	because that would make the game crash, or show a blank spot
2016-06-25 21:18:51	@Espyo	it seems like an honest typo
2016-06-25 21:18:56	@Espyo	which, granted, isn't a very hard one to make
2016-06-25 21:19:04	@Espyo	I'm willing to give this as my final answer
2016-06-25 21:19:16	@Espyo	thanks, Marty2000, but you're not without credit either
2016-06-25 21:19:21	@Espyo	you helped solve plenty a mystery too
2016-06-25 21:19:30	Marty2000	Well, just an image, he he
2016-06-25 21:19:52	@Espyo	heck, you were the first to find the typo
2016-06-25 21:19:57	@Espyo	well, at least to find and talk about it
2016-06-25 21:20:03	Scruffy	oh! Speaking of typos
2016-06-25 21:20:23	Scruffy	I found one in the American instruction manual for /Pikmin/
2016-06-25 21:20:27	Marty2000	Nice!
2016-06-25 21:20:34	Marty2000	"holdung"?
2016-06-25 21:20:40	Scruffy	Not that one
2016-06-25 21:20:43	@Espyo	ah yes--
2016-06-25 21:20:43	Scruffy	Hang on
2016-06-25 21:20:45	@Espyo	wait, another?
2016-06-25 21:21:00	@Espyo	hmm, I think I found two, back in the day, and documented both
2016-06-25 21:21:02	@Espyo	[[Mistake]]
2016-06-25 21:21:02	Testyo	"Mistake" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Mistake
2016-06-25 21:21:30	@Espyo	no other documented typos
2016-06-25 21:21:45	@Espyo	ok, I want to add Dept to the wiki, but we need to figure out which versions are and aren't affected
2016-06-25 21:21:54	@Espyo	EU GC, US GC, EU Wii, US Wii
2016-06-25 21:22:04	@Espyo	both GC ones are affected, I saw it in videos
2016-06-25 21:22:51	Marty2000	I'll try to find videos
2016-06-25 21:22:56	@Espyo	all right
2016-06-25 21:23:04	@Espyo	but it may be hard to tell if the video you're seeing is US or EU
2016-06-25 21:23:33	Scruffy	on page 6, the speech by Olimar
2016-06-25 21:23:39	Marty2000	1. Check the Youtuber's profile and see if he lives in US
2016-06-25 21:23:45	Marty2000	2. Check the treasures
2016-06-25 21:23:53	Marty2000	That's what I can do to guess what version he plays on ;)
2016-06-25 21:24:19	@Espyo	I'm checking speedrun.com
2016-06-25 21:24:20	Scruffy	"A strange feeling came over me... I then felt a premonition that my short trip would soon be become an epic adventure."
2016-06-25 21:24:25	Scruffy	be become
2016-06-25 21:24:28	@Espyo	since it specifies whether a video is US, EU, GC, or Wii
2016-06-25 21:24:30	Marty2000	be become
2016-06-25 21:24:33	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 21:24:34	Scruffy	the be occurs right before a line break
2016-06-25 21:24:43	@Espyo	"be become"?
2016-06-25 21:24:43	Scruffy	So no one would ever see that
2016-06-25 21:24:44	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-25 21:25:01	Scruffy	But I think this only occurs in the American version
2016-06-25 21:25:20	Scruffy	From what I recall the European manual has a different page design
2016-06-25 21:25:36	@Espyo	US Wii says "Debt"
2016-06-25 21:25:46	@Espyo	"Results Prior to Repaying Debt"
2016-06-25 21:26:18	Marty2000	Espyo
2016-06-25 21:26:28	Marty2000	...too late :p
2016-06-25 21:26:44	@Espyo	hm?
2016-06-25 21:26:46	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/IHMP_JhDbds?list=PLagawvxLDscbwznobJ7knkHgQQqD6453G I'll check if this is the EU version
2016-06-25 21:26:51	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-25 21:27:00	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/IHMP_JhDbds?t=16m50s
2016-06-25 21:27:02	@Espyo	Scruffy: P1 manual, aye?
2016-06-25 21:27:03	Marty2000	16 min 50 s
2016-06-25 21:27:35	Scruffy	Espyo: yep
2016-06-25 21:27:48	@Espyo	"soon become an epic adventure"
2016-06-25 21:27:50	@Espyo	fixed here
2016-06-25 21:28:14	@Espyo	and it's "soon become\nan epic adventure"
2016-06-25 21:28:32	@Espyo	("soon become<line break>an epic adventure" if you're not programmery enough ;) )
2016-06-25 21:29:32	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-25 21:29:55	Scruffy	SO that means someone wrote the same thing twice with a typo once?
2016-06-25 21:29:58	Marty2000	ok, my video shows the American version...
2016-06-25 21:30:08	@Espyo	maybe
2016-06-25 21:30:43	Scruffy	Maybe they were adapting the paragraph for the European version and noticed the typo and were just like "Screw it, we've already printed hundreds of these things."
2016-06-25 21:31:02	Scruffy	So it got left in the american manual
2016-06-25 21:31:17	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-25 21:32:16	@Espyo	Scruffy: are you adding the mistake? if not, let me do it, since I'm already editing the article for the "Dept" typo
2016-06-25 21:32:31	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/eAVAyvCey6Y?t=27m6s
2016-06-25 21:32:37	Marty2000	Text changed in the Eu version
2016-06-25 21:32:40	Marty2000	EU*
2016-06-25 21:32:46	@Espyo	so that's definitely the EU version?
2016-06-25 21:32:56	Marty2000	This one video shows the EU version, yeah
2016-06-25 21:32:59	@Espyo	oh, the text is entirely different
2016-06-25 21:32:59	@Espyo	neat
2016-06-25 21:33:02	@Espyo	all right, all settled then!
2016-06-25 21:33:19	Scruffy	You can add it then, if you're already doing it
2016-06-25 21:34:01	@Espyo	all right
2016-06-25 21:35:05	Marty2000	I feel like today has been a productive day on Pikmin science. We solved two mysteries at once
2016-06-25 21:35:26	Marty2000	for Pikmin science
2016-06-25 21:35:41	@Espyo	yep!
2016-06-25 21:36:16	@Espyo	btw, Scruffy, your manual has "holdung" too, right?

2016-06-25 21:40:15	@Espyo	ah, I can see it here

2016-06-25 21:40:24	@Espyo	using the link to the manual here
2016-06-25 21:40:31	@Espyo	it's the US version, since it has "be become"
2016-06-25 21:40:37	@Espyo	and sure enough, it doesn't have "holdung"
2016-06-25 21:40:51	@Espyo	"It is dangerous to attack from beneath an enemy, but you can slow them down around the feet."
2016-06-25 21:40:55	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-25 21:41:01	@Espyo	in the EU version, it's something like "(...), but you can holdung to its feet"
2016-06-25 21:41:34	Scruffy	Well at least the US version isn't void of error
2016-06-25 21:41:40	Scruffy	It just has its own unique error
2016-06-25 21:43:06	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-25 21:43:25	@Espyo	Marty2000: I'm not so sure about that glitch...
2016-06-25 21:43:33	@Espyo	it might've just been somebody that got mistaken
2016-06-25 21:43:48	@Espyo	or maybe, the two treasures swapped places in the EU/US/GC/Wii version debacle
2016-06-25 21:44:02	Marty2000	Well, I'll try to check later or tomorrow... I'll see and tell you
2016-06-25 21:44:06	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-25 21:44:21	Marty2000	Now that I've seen that, I absolutely want to verify
2016-06-25 21:44:25	Scruffy	I have to get going for now
2016-06-25 21:44:28	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 21:44:31	Marty2000	See you soon!
2016-06-25 21:44:33	Scruffy	Glad I could help solve some mysteries!
2016-06-25 21:44:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-25 21:44:41	Marty2000	It was fun doing science with you too!
2016-06-25 21:44:43	Scruffy	I might not be on until tomorrow
2016-06-25 21:44:49	Marty2000	Okay!

2016-06-25 22:25:25	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-06-25 22:25:30	@Espyo	can you add that info then, Marty?

2016-06-25 22:28:16	Marty2000	I'll try to see more in-depth tomorrow
2016-06-25 22:30:42	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-25 22:30:56	Marty2000	I think it's best to keep that info somewhere for the moment, and tomorrow, I'll check...
2016-06-25 22:31:02	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2016-06-25 22:31:19	Marty2000	It won't take much time: I have the game on Dolphin, and the NPC! game on my hacked Wii, so I'll get the answer in an hour, probably

2016-06-25 22:48:51	@PikFan	hi
2016-06-25 22:49:14	@PikFan	hey Marty: when you're in Splatfest, what's your average Splatfest Power?
2016-06-25 22:49:38	Marty2000	Hi PikFan
2016-06-25 22:49:55	Marty2000	Depends... once I got to 1800, the last time, I dropped to 1550... (around)
2016-06-25 22:50:09	@PikFan	ouch
2016-06-25 22:50:41	@PikFan	I think the highest SP I ever got was like in the 1670s maybe
2016-06-25 22:50:51	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 22:50:55	@PikFan	I don't know why, I just can't reach 1700
2016-06-25 22:51:11	@PikFan	I'm struggling with 1600 as is
2016-06-25 22:51:36	@PikFan	highest SP I got for this Splatfest, so far, is 1536
2016-06-25 22:51:51	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 22:51:58	Marty2000	It also depends on your rank, I think
2016-06-25 22:52:07	Marty2000	I'll search for information once I've finished my match
2016-06-25 22:52:14	@PikFan	I purposely deranked myself before Splatfest
2016-06-25 22:52:31	@PikFan	if you're an A rank, you start at 1400
2016-06-25 22:52:39	@PikFan	if you're S, you start at 1600
2016-06-25 22:52:48	@PikFan	if you're S+, you start at 1700
2016-06-25 22:53:00	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 22:53:10	@PikFan	the people who get 2000 and higher are like... S+++
2016-06-25 22:54:03	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-25 22:54:20	Marty2000	By the way, the 100 best people of a Splatfest are posted on Nintendo's Facebook...
2016-06-25 22:54:25	Marty2000	You often find the same people
2016-06-25 22:54:38	@PikFan	for the European Splatfests, right?
2016-06-25 22:54:53	@PikFan	the American Splatfest Top 100 is posted on the tumblr
2016-06-25 22:54:55	Marty2000	Maybe only for the Europeans ones... I dunno for the rest
2016-06-25 22:54:57	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-25 22:55:16	@PikFan	and I forget where the Japanese ones are posted
2016-06-25 22:57:16	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-06-25 22:57:31	@PikFan	so I was on a team, and our team's SP was like 1700
2016-06-25 22:57:40	@PikFan	and the enemy team's SP was about 1800
2016-06-25 22:57:46	@PikFan	we beat the enemy team
2016-06-25 22:58:04	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-25 22:58:08	@PikFan	ironically, the next match, we went against a team with an SP of 1600, and we lost to them
2016-06-25 22:58:09	Marty2000	Nice
2016-06-25 22:58:14	@PikFan	I see something very, very wrong with that
2016-06-25 23:00:51	@PikFan	oh, so I told one of my skype friends how to use Splathax

2016-06-26 02:15:11	@PikFan	that header though
2016-06-26 02:17:02	CraftedPbody	These pikmin were meant to be designed to where they'd basically be optional to get.
2016-06-26 02:17:18	@PikFan	I see

2016-06-26 02:17:42	@PikFan	you've got all these ideas laying around
2016-06-26 02:17:47	CraftedPbody	I've been considering

2016-06-26 02:19:35	CraftedPbody	I would definitely like to try, but not yet.

2016-06-26 02:22:08	CraftedPbody	I drew it and it looks much larger than it's actually supposed to be.

2016-06-26 14:27:43	@Espyo	that's no banter
2016-06-26 14:27:48	@Espyo	that's actual rage between the two of them

2016-06-26 16:25:40	@Espyo	of all the ways wikia could have to handle this "upload a thumbnail to place it on articles" thing
2016-06-26 16:25:47	@Espyo	the way they did it is probably the worst possible one
2016-06-26 16:25:57	@Espyo	the images are not placed in a category, they have no description...

2016-06-26 18:14:18	@Espyo	click on it to create it
2016-06-26 18:19:10	CraftedPbody	How does one make an infobox template? I know it's possible, Scruffy made one for his pikmin forever metals
2016-06-26 18:20:35	@Espyo	what, on fanon?
2016-06-26 18:20:50	@Espyo	depends on what the infobox is for
2016-06-26 18:20:52	CraftedPbody	yeah
2016-06-26 18:20:59	@Espyo	if it's an enemy infobox, I think you just use the general enemy infobox
2016-06-26 18:21:08	@Espyo	and then fill in the fields with what you need
2016-06-26 18:21:21	@Espyo	but if there's one infobox for each game, then you just create it as if you were creating a new page
2016-06-26 18:21:26	@Espyo	called something like Template:Infobox enemy <your game>
2016-06-26 18:21:37	@Espyo	but I'm not sure which of the two should be done
2016-06-26 18:21:46	CraftedPbody	Well, it's not necessarily an enemy
2016-06-26 18:22:37	@Espyo	a new gameplay element?
2016-06-26 18:23:15	CraftedPbody	Like, objects that can be carried or interacted with that aren't treasures or enemies.
2016-06-26 18:23:36	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-06-26 18:23:41	@Espyo	might need a new infobox, then
2016-06-26 18:24:56	CraftedPbody	how do you make one?
2016-06-26 18:25:07	@Espyo	well, infobox are stupidly complicated
2016-06-26 18:25:20	@Espyo	easily one of the hardest types of templates to make
2016-06-26 18:25:33	@Espyo	you can try copying an existing infobox and adjusting it
2016-06-26 18:25:39	@Espyo	but otherwise, you'll have to get somebody to create it

2016-06-26 18:32:04	CraftedPbody	I think that nothing has ever weighed 15.
2016-06-26 18:32:34	CraftedPbody	They 12 or 20 but never 15

2016-06-26 18:36:00	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-06-26 18:42:23	CraftedPbody	would "magnoluminum" work in a scientific name?
2016-06-26 18:43:08	CraftedPbody	I mean, the Colossal Glowcap isn't an enemy, but it is still a plant, so I figured I might as well put the scientific name.
2016-06-26 18:43:44	CraftedPbody	So I was thinking "Fungi magnoluminum"
2016-06-26 18:46:05	@Espyo	I think it works
2016-06-26 18:46:18	CraftedPbody	I just realized it can have three parts

2016-06-26 20:24:04	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Rock_Pikmin Want an oddity about "10 on a charge's first attack"? :p
2016-06-26 20:24:29	Marty2000	2016-06-10 21:41:34	Marty2000	It's not really the same for crystal gates 2016-06-10 21:41:54	Marty2000	Let's take, for instance, the one in the Tropical Forest (Mission Mode) 2016-06-10 21:42:22	Marty2000	If you leave the Rock Pikmin destroy it alone, it should dea
2016-06-26 20:24:38	Marty2000	2016-06-10 21:42:32	Marty2000	It destroys the gate after 93 hits 2016-06-10 21:42:46	Marty2000	However, using the charge move, it should only deal 10 points of damages... 2016-06-10 21:42:55	Marty2000	But it only destroys the gate in 9 charges :p
2016-06-26 20:24:40	Marty2000	2016-06-10 21:43:05	Marty2000	And I use the same part of the gate for each experiment 2016-06-10 21:44:12	Marty2000	Same when it is thrown 2016-06-10 21:44:58	Marty2000	So when charging, Rock Pikmin deal the same number of damages as when they are thrown (only for gates)
2016-06-26 20:26:51	Marty2000	which means we have to change the infobox again
2016-06-26 20:27:23	@Espyo	hm, yeah, I remember you talking of it
2016-06-26 20:27:26	@Espyo	uuuuuuggghhh
2016-06-26 20:27:47	@Espyo	okay, instead of cramming it all on the infobox
2016-06-26 20:27:58	@Espyo	let's just write "Depends" and link to a section on the article that explains it all in detail

2016-06-26 22:47:08	@Espyo	right, so
2016-06-26 22:47:16	@Espyo	LoganPikmin keeps editing pages that belong to other users
2016-06-26 22:47:23	@Espyo	sometimes stuff that seems legitimate, like categorizing treasures
2016-06-26 22:47:30	@Espyo	other times to change names of enemies
2016-06-26 22:47:34	@Espyo	so, yeah, please take a look
2016-06-26 22:47:43	@Espyo	see if he's a nutjob or if he's doing all right except for one or two incidents
2016-06-26 22:48:00	@PikFan	LoganPikmin is a weird user anyway, but I haven't seen him do stuff like this

2016-06-26 23:01:47	@PikFan	it was pretty epic
2016-06-26 23:02:12	@PikFan	but I wonder what this means for the next 
2016-06-26 23:02:15	@PikFan	Splatfest
2016-06-26 23:02:19	@PikFan	ugh, enter key
2016-06-26 23:02:30	@PikFan	does this mean... the next one... is our last one?!
2016-06-26 23:02:42	@PikFan	the final Splatfest: Callie vs Marie?!
2016-06-26 23:03:04	CraftedPbody	yeah
2016-06-26 23:03:13	CraftedPbody	that's actually what I'm thinking
2016-06-26 23:03:26	CraftedPbody	Marie all the way for me
2016-06-26 23:04:29	CraftedPbody	Hmmm...
2016-06-26 23:04:42	@Espyo	eeeewwww...
2016-06-26 23:04:57	CraftedPbody	What?
2016-06-26 23:05:04	CraftedPbody	You like Callie?
2016-06-26 23:06:22	@PikFan	but anyway, there's no way that they can just let us off like that
2016-06-26 23:07:51	CraftedPbody	Would there ever be a mario vs luigi?
2016-06-26 23:08:07	@PikFan	it's not inconceivable
2016-06-26 23:08:12	CraftedPbody	I would totally be Luigi for that
2016-06-26 23:08:17	@PikFan	they did have Pokemon Red vs Blue
2016-06-26 23:08:40	@Espyo	Callie > Marie
2016-06-26 23:08:53	CraftedPbody	What if they used a splatfest to decide a new pikmin type?
2016-06-26 23:09:12	@PikFan	eeeehh...
2016-06-26 23:09:21	@PikFan	that'd be awesome, but it probably won't happen
2016-06-26 23:10:06	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-26 23:10:09	@Espyo	awesome... and horrible
2016-06-26 23:10:15	@Espyo	they'd have a good, but balanced choice
2016-06-26 23:10:19	@Espyo	and a crappy overpowered one
2016-06-26 23:10:24	@Espyo	the OP one would win
2016-06-26 23:10:33	@Espyo	and Pikmin 4 would have something worse than Purples and Spicy Winged combine
2016-06-26 23:10:33	@Espyo	*d
2016-06-26 23:11:56	CraftedPbody	What if they didn't give us any context as to what it was, it was just one ability or the other
2016-06-26 23:12:55	Marty2000	Espyo: Spicy Winged are that bad for you? heh :p
2016-06-26 23:12:58	Marty2000	I mean, too OP?
2016-06-26 23:12:59	@Espyo	not bad
2016-06-26 23:13:00	@Espyo	too good
2016-06-26 23:13:03	@Espyo	yeah, they're incredibly OP

2016-06-26 23:13:11	@Espyo	I was trying to join
2016-06-26 23:13:13	@Espyo	and there was a disconnect

2016-06-26 23:13:18	@Espyo	we're pretty sure you can force people to disconnect
2016-06-26 23:13:21	@Espyo	it's just too common
2016-06-26 23:13:31	@Espyo	hm, that would be nicer, yeah
2016-06-26 23:13:45	Marty2000	Heh, it would be so mean to do that, but seems actually true...
2016-06-26 23:13:52	CraftedPbody	Cyan vs. Brown
2016-06-26 23:14:00	CraftedPbody	Something like that
2016-06-26 23:15:13	CraftedPbody	Like if they were to decide rock or winged it would be "Hard as Rock vs Lighter than Air"

2016-06-27 00:27:11	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-06-27 00:27:24	@PikFan	hey, so
2016-06-27 00:27:52	@PikFan	I have a request for you, but it might be better for you to do it when you come back for your trip
2016-06-27 00:28:17	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-06-27 00:28:35	Scruffy	Lay it on me
2016-06-27 00:28:41	@PikFan	hehe, alright
2016-06-27 00:28:57	@PikFan	I was wondering if you could compose a theme for the Rugged Tundra
2016-06-27 00:29:27	Scruffy	Oh, absolutely!
2016-06-27 00:29:45	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-27 00:30:02	@PikFan	I mean, you don't have to do it right away, what with your trip coming up and all
2016-06-27 00:30:07	Scruffy	Right right
2016-06-27 00:30:14	@PikFan	in fact, I'll be back at the same time as you, probably
2016-06-27 00:30:20	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-27 00:30:20	@PikFan	you said you'll be gone for a week?
2016-06-27 00:30:24	Scruffy	10 days
2016-06-27 00:30:29	Scruffy	I'll be back July 10
2016-06-27 00:30:29	@PikFan	oh, 10 days
2016-06-27 00:30:32	@PikFan	close enough
2016-06-27 00:30:45	Scruffy	I'll probably be able to get started though
2016-06-27 00:30:51	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-27 00:31:15	@PikFan	well then
2016-06-27 00:31:35	@PikFan	could you try to make it sound similar to the Valley of Repose/Distant Tundra?
2016-06-27 00:31:50	@PikFan	not a remix, but I mean, just recreate the feel
2016-06-27 00:32:25	Scruffy	Of course, of course
2016-06-27 00:32:32	Scruffy	I have an idea
2016-06-27 00:32:41	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-06-27 00:33:38	Scruffy	I could create a version of the theme for each subarea
2016-06-27 00:33:44	Scruffy	That work seamlessly into each other
2016-06-27 00:33:49	@PikFan	ooh
2016-06-27 00:33:57	@PikFan	sure, if you'd like
2016-06-27 00:33:57	Scruffy	They'd be only slightly different
2016-06-27 00:34:06	@PikFan	that's a great idea, actually
2016-06-27 00:34:22	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-06-27 00:34:24	Scruffy	This'll be fun
2016-06-27 00:34:40	@PikFan	how hard would it be to create 7 variations?
2016-06-27 00:34:53	Scruffy	Not too challenging
2016-06-27 00:34:56	Scruffy	I think
2016-06-27 00:35:03	@PikFan	do you just copy the original song and tweak some instruments?
2016-06-27 00:35:13	Scruffy	Would you also want mixes for battling, carrying, task-ing?
2016-06-27 00:35:20	Scruffy	yes
2016-06-27 00:35:26	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-06-27 00:35:36	@PikFan	well, first, just create the most basic song
2016-06-27 00:35:48	@PikFan	and we'll go from there
2016-06-27 00:35:50	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-27 00:36:03	@PikFan	also, something else
2016-06-27 00:36:20	@PikFan	the Valley of Repose and Distant Tundra have rather... calm feelings to them
2016-06-27 00:36:48	Scruffy	Mhm
2016-06-27 00:36:54	@PikFan	but because the Rugged Tundra is bigger and more open than those areas, I want there to be like a "desolate" feeling to it
2016-06-27 00:37:04	@PikFan	I want the song itself to sound rugged
2016-06-27 00:37:20	Scruffy	Alright
2016-06-27 00:37:40	@PikFan	you've heard this song before, but I feel like it captures that rugged feeling pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T16wc391pyI

2016-06-27 02:15:14	CraftedPbody	that's unfortunate, I like talking to him...
2016-06-27 02:18:17	@PikFan	yeah, he had to go
2016-06-27 02:18:48	CraftedPbody	He said he'd be on later but I guess not

2016-06-27 02:19:33	CraftedPbody	I need a pikmin 2 cave song to listen to while I work on making this mission level in the engine...
2016-06-27 02:19:47	CraftedPbody	It's called "Hidden Garden"
2016-06-27 02:20:00	@PikFan	the name sounds familiar
2016-06-27 02:20:06	CraftedPbody	does it?
2016-06-27 02:20:54	CraftedPbody	Hmmm... Might have to rename it... I don't want to call it Buried Garden, because I'm saving that name for a cave.
2016-06-27 02:21:22	CraftedPbody	And this one isn't necessarily buried.
2016-06-27 02:22:28	@PikFan	right

2016-06-27 02:24:49	CraftedPbody	yeah, it's the hidden garden
2016-06-27 02:25:04	CraftedPbody	might change the grass texture.
2016-06-27 02:25:18	CraftedPbody	oh, I meant pikmin 2 cave music

2016-06-27 03:37:25	@PikFan	or maybe rollbacker
2016-06-27 03:37:28	CraftedPbody	Could it be that he's trying to back-seat moderate?

2016-06-27 03:37:40	@PikFan	such a wannabe
2016-06-27 03:38:08	@PikFan	but yeah, he asked me if I could promote him

2016-06-27 03:38:34	CraftedPbody	I told him not to touch my stuff when I fixed my page the last time.
2016-06-27 03:38:50	@PikFan	mhm
2016-06-27 03:40:19	@PikFan	I mean, honestly, I think "Electric Dumple" sounds better than "Electric Water Dumple", but it's your enemy, not mine
2016-06-27 03:40:25	@PikFan	so I respect that
2016-06-27 03:40:33	@PikFan	him, on the other hand...

2016-06-27 03:43:05	@PikFan	I'm going to Utah for a week on Wednesday
2016-06-27 03:44:44	CraftedPbody	I have Electric Water Dumple for two reasons... 1. Water Dumples are basically Catfish and there are Electric Catfish, thus Electric Water Dumple. 2. water should be specified because not only does it not swim in electricity, but also because it actually lives in deeper pools of water than most Water Dumples.
2016-06-27 03:45:18	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-27 03:45:27	@PikFan	well, there you go

2016-06-27 03:45:57	@PikFan	nothing wrong with that

2016-06-27 03:47:11	CraftedPbody	"Electric-Water Dumple" that's another thing he tried to name it...
2016-06-27 03:47:12	@PikFan	but hey, at least I try to edit in a way that doesn't involve changing ideas
2016-06-27 03:47:22	@PikFan	random punctuation much
2016-06-27 03:47:32	@PikFan	he can't get his spelling and grammar right
2016-06-27 03:47:42	@PikFan	would you like to rant to us about that, En_Passant?
2016-06-27 03:47:56	CraftedPbody	I looked at his works, they have terrible grammar. 
2016-06-27 03:48:13	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-27 03:48:36	En_Passant	You could, but it'd be preaching to the quire
2016-06-27 03:48:38	CraftedPbody	If he wants to fix something, he should fix his own works.

2016-06-27 03:48:52	CraftedPbody	lol
2016-06-27 03:49:00	En_Passant	idk how I screwed that up
2016-06-27 03:49:00	@PikFan	exactly
2016-06-27 03:49:19	@PikFan	yeah, I had to look up quire, and I was like "that's not right" :P
2016-06-27 03:49:32	CraftedPbody	Oh, so En_Passant you recall that carryable glowcap I mentioned yesterday?
2016-06-27 03:49:45	@PikFan	I even told him that he should work on his own articles, not other people's articles
2016-06-27 03:49:49	CraftedPbody	I drew it.
2016-06-27 03:50:33	CraftedPbody	let me go fetch that image

2016-06-27 03:51:33	CraftedPbody	I think I also mentioned this on the forums a while back
2016-06-27 03:51:34	En_Passant	Oh, that's a good drawing
2016-06-27 03:52:33	En_Passant	I figured it'd have a weight of like 3
2016-06-27 03:53:06	CraftedPbody	http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/thread/242/large-glowcap-gameplay-mechanic-enemy Yup here it is, PikFan already commented on it i see
2016-06-27 03:53:31	@PikFan	I commented on that 2 months ago lol
2016-06-27 03:55:08	CraftedPbody	So, in response to the 10 pikmin rather than 15, I chose 15 so the player can't simply have one purple carry it. I imagine puzzles where the player orders the pikmin to carry it and then call them back when they need to work on a task.
2016-06-27 03:55:19	CraftedPbody	and then pick it up again
2016-06-27 03:56:19	CraftedPbody	PikFan, do you know how to make an infobox template?
2016-06-27 03:56:29	@PikFan	sure, why?
2016-06-27 03:57:58	CraftedPbody	I would like to make one for Special Objects that can be picked or interacted with from pikmin, or at the very least, I'd like one similar to the enemy template, except it might say function rather than attack
2016-06-27 03:58:43	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-27 04:01:24	CraftedPbody	Maybe have the boxes say, "|Object Type=y"  "|Object Class=x" if class is plant add a scientific name then "|Function=z" etc.

2016-06-27 04:05:23	CraftedPbody	Like let me do one for a canon object, the Cardboard Box. "|Object Type=pushable" "|Object Class=man-made" "|Weight=10" "Function=blocks paths, forms bridges"
2016-06-27 04:05:34	CraftedPbody	I asked Espyo
2016-06-27 04:05:39	@PikFan	oh, you did?
2016-06-27 04:05:57	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-27 04:06:08	@PikFan	well, I can at least start part of it
2016-06-27 04:06:28	@PikFan	what do you want the infobox called?
2016-06-27 04:06:30	CraftedPbody	He said to ask someone who knew how to or to try and mess around with an existing one, but I tried and... no-dice...
2016-06-27 04:06:42	CraftedPbody	Infobox Object
2016-06-27 04:06:42	@PikFan	bah
2016-06-27 04:06:54	@PikFan	don't see why he can't do it
2016-06-27 04:07:10	CraftedPbody	"extremely complicated"
2016-06-27 04:07:19	@PikFan	what
2016-06-27 04:07:43	@PikFan	...maybe you explained it to him in a way that sounded extremely complicated
2016-06-27 04:07:45	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-27 04:09:40	@PikFan	okay, so you want type, class, and function as your new parameters, right?
2016-06-27 04:09:50	@PikFan	and everything else like the enemy infobox?
2016-06-27 04:11:57	CraftedPbody	from top to bottom : Type, Class, *Family. *Weight, *Max Carriers, Function
2016-06-27 04:12:10	@PikFan	that's it?
2016-06-27 04:12:57	CraftedPbody	and of course, at the top would be image and image size... Oh, also before Type should be Areas.
2016-06-27 04:13:16	@PikFan	areas and caves?
2016-06-27 04:13:20	CraftedPbody	yup
2016-06-27 04:13:48	@PikFan	I'm assuming that the * denotes optional parameters
2016-06-27 04:13:54	CraftedPbody	yup
2016-06-27 04:14:23	@PikFan	unfortunately, I'm not sure how to make a parameter optional, as is the case here http://www.pikminfanon.com/Template:Infobox_enemy
2016-06-27 04:14:40	@PikFan	so... I hope what I make will work, for now
2016-06-27 04:16:07	CraftedPbody	I can test what you make on my sandbox page
2016-06-27 04:17:43	CraftedPbody	you could put the * before optional fields on the template and then the user can delete the fields as they see fit for the object.
2016-06-27 04:19:12	@PikFan	done http://www.pikminfanon.com/Template:Infobox_object
2016-06-27 04:19:24	@PikFan	...that was a lot less painless than I thought it'd be
2016-06-27 04:28:52	CraftedPbody	wait... so
2016-06-27 04:29:24	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-06-27 04:29:42	CraftedPbody	Is it possible for me to insert the stuff now with a template like the enemy template or to I edit that and copy it?
2016-06-27 04:31:53	En_Passant	I know how to make fields optional
2016-06-27 04:31:56	@PikFan	yeah, you can do it now
2016-06-27 04:32:09	@PikFan	you can use it like any other infobox, I mean
2016-06-27 04:32:14	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/f4f23842b057fa49ab4a859796295dbf.png I'm copying it from the page but I don't know how to do this
2016-06-27 04:32:15	@PikFan	oh, yay
2016-06-27 04:32:41	@PikFan	what do you mean? that's right
2016-06-27 04:32:49	@PikFan	besides...whatever happened to the image
2016-06-27 04:37:55	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/97176306aff887fac4144ab6a2fd217b.png
2016-06-27 04:38:23	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-06-27 04:38:33	@PikFan	you dun broke it :P
2016-06-27 04:38:40	@PikFan	but seriously, I don't know what's wrong
2016-06-27 04:38:45	@PikFan	and I have to go now, anyway
2016-06-27 04:38:48	@PikFan	bad timing...
2016-06-27 04:38:52	@PikFan	sorry
2016-06-27 04:38:57	@PikFan	see ya

2016-06-27 04:39:06	CraftedPbody	Do you know how to do this En_Passant?
2016-06-27 04:39:34	En_Passant	Yes, give me a little time
2016-06-27 04:40:13	CraftedPbody	Okiedoke
2016-06-27 04:41:11	CraftedPbody	Wait, are you working on it already? If not, let me go in and do something first.
2016-06-27 04:41:45	En_Passant	I am
2016-06-27 04:42:57	CraftedPbody	oh.... Er... can you add a field please then?
2016-06-27 04:43:25	CraftedPbody	Above Family can you add Scientific name?
2016-06-27 04:47:33	En_Passant	Of objects?
2016-06-27 04:54:38	CraftedPbody	yeah, it would be an optional field
2016-06-27 04:54:54	CraftedPbody	if the object
2016-06-27 04:55:05	CraftedPbody	is a plant
2016-06-27 04:55:19	En_Passant	Which consists entirely of this one object
2016-06-27 04:55:25	CraftedPbody	if the class of the object is plant
2016-06-27 04:55:41	En_Passant	Which consists entirely of this one object
2016-06-27 04:55:48	CraftedPbody	such as my colossal glowcap
2016-06-27 04:56:23	En_Passant	Won't you be making an Infobox enemy on it anyway?
2016-06-27 04:56:35	CraftedPbody	no
2016-06-27 04:57:26	CraftedPbody	If the class of object is a plant it gets the optional fields of Scientific Name and Family. If the class is man-made then these fields aren't put in.
2016-06-27 05:00:46	CraftedPbody	Just like if the object is a pushable or carryable, then it gets the optional weight and max carriers fields, but if it's a buildable  these fields wouldn't be put in.
2016-06-27 05:01:43	CraftedPbody	The exeption for a plant object that wouldn't get a scientific name is a buildable stick.
2016-06-27 05:01:51	CraftedPbody	like the ones in Pikmin 1
2016-06-27 05:01:57	CraftedPbody	and Pikmin 3
2016-06-27 05:04:11	En_Passant	I'm not that good
2016-06-27 05:06:38	CraftedPbody	Like, just make it like this "Image, Image size, Areas, Underground Areas, Type, Class, *Scientific Name, *Family, *Carry weight, *Max Carriers, Fuction"
2016-06-27 05:06:55	CraftedPbody	* denoting optional fields
2016-06-27 05:19:13	En_Passant	Okay, I think it works
2016-06-27 05:19:25	En_Passant	I'm going to bed now, have a full day tomorrow
2016-06-27 05:19:33	CraftedPbody	cool let me test it, and gn

2016-06-27 12:06:16	Klemen702	why does & exist?

2016-06-27 17:22:08	CraftedPbody	speaking of which, I need to tweek my object infobox a bit more
2016-06-27 17:25:41	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-27 17:27:18	CraftedPbody	oh god... LoganPikmin wants to mess around with my infobox now...

2016-06-27 17:41:05	Klemen702	i have a question (not just for you)
2016-06-27 17:41:11	Klemen702	is it possible to change an account's name
2016-06-27 17:41:22	Klemen702	there is a SLIGHT chance i might change from ''Klemen702'' to something else
2016-06-27 17:41:36	Scruffy	On chat? Yeah just say nick/
2016-06-27 17:41:38	Klemen702	a much more simpler, and less real-life-name giving name
2016-06-27 17:41:43	Scruffy	and then type your new name
2016-06-27 17:41:44	Klemen702	well
2016-06-27 17:41:47	Klemen702	i meant on pikipedia
2016-06-27 17:42:09	Scruffy	Oh
2016-06-27 17:42:12	Scruffy	I'm not sure
2016-06-27 17:45:16	CraftedPbody	hey scruffy
2016-06-27 17:45:23	Scruffy	Hi CraftedPBody!
2016-06-27 17:45:31	CraftedPbody	how're you today?
2016-06-27 17:45:43	Scruffy	Would you know how to change a username? Klemen702 is looking to change
2016-06-27 17:45:46	Scruffy	I'm doing well
2016-06-27 17:45:52	Scruffy	How are you?
2016-06-27 17:46:09	CraftedPbody	I do not know how to change nicknames...
2016-06-27 17:46:19	Scruffy	Oh, I mean usernames on Pikipedia
2016-06-27 17:46:31	CraftedPbody	oh, Pikipedia?
2016-06-27 17:46:39	CraftedPbody	Can you even do that?
2016-06-27 17:46:46	Scruffy	I have no clue
2016-06-27 17:47:04	Scruffy	I assume you just create a new account and alert everybody that it's the same user
2016-06-27 17:47:08	CraftedPbody	Um... I definitely don't know how to do that.
2016-06-27 17:47:20	UltraMario	you rang?
2016-06-27 17:47:21	UltraMario	;)
2016-06-27 17:47:33	Scruffy	Heh, hi um
2016-06-27 17:47:45	CraftedPbody	oh... lol
2016-06-27 17:48:20	CraftedPbody	Sorry, didn't mean to summon you.. lol
2016-06-27 17:48:57	CraftedPbody	So, I learned how infoboxes are made.
2016-06-27 17:49:11	Klemen702	rip then
2016-06-27 17:50:01	CraftedPbody	And now there's a new infobox that is probably going to be VERY useful. Though... I may have to tweek it... a bit...
2016-06-27 17:50:06	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-27 17:50:16	UltraMario	i liked being summoned :3
2016-06-27 17:50:34	Scruffy	Hi Marty!
2016-06-27 17:50:39	Marty2000	You can change your account's name, Klemen702
2016-06-27 17:50:54	Marty2000	Ask Espyo, he did that for a certain user called TabuuandPeach (originally TabuuandMasterCore)
2016-06-27 17:51:19	CraftedPbody	Since carry weight isn't a universal term for objects that can be interacted with.... I think I'll change it to "Max. Required Pikmin" and "Min. Required Pikmin"
2016-06-27 17:51:45	CraftedPbody	Since a cardboard box is pushed, not carried.
2016-06-27 17:52:37	CraftedPbody	and see-saw blocks are weighed down, not carried.
2016-06-27 17:52:39	Marty2000	Oh, yes
2016-06-27 17:53:31	CraftedPbody	I'll do this soon.
2016-06-27 17:53:35	CraftedPbody	brb
2016-06-27 17:54:00	Scruffy	Good thinking, sounds like a useful infobox
2016-06-27 18:00:07	CraftedPbody	There.
2016-06-27 18:00:19	CraftedPbody	So, if anyone wants to use it, it's ready.
2016-06-27 18:01:30	CraftedPbody	This applies to a lot of things : Gates, Bridges, Buildables, Carriables, Pushables
2016-06-27 18:01:52	CraftedPbody	Actually, Bridges are buildables
2016-06-27 18:02:15	CraftedPbody	Oh, Destructibles 
2016-06-27 18:02:27	Klemen702	i'll only ask him ''how it can happen''
2016-06-27 18:02:35	Klemen702	i still haven't fully considered if i want the name change
2016-06-27 18:02:36	CraftedPbody	gates are destructibles 
2016-06-27 18:18:24	UltraMario	guys nintendo privated their squid kid splatoon commercial video lol
2016-06-27 18:19:30	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-27 18:20:43	UltraMario	i guess they couldnt take the backlash
2016-06-27 18:20:44	UltraMario	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-06-27 18:23:06	UltraMario	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjPOSKnOftA
2016-06-27 18:23:07	UltraMario	rip
2016-06-27 18:27:56	CraftedPbody	"This rare delicacy is far to hefty to relocate, and so it's best to eat it raw upon locating the large specimen." How does this sound for a Louie's notes?
2016-06-27 18:28:36	Scruffy	Good, but "relocate" doesn't mean to find again
2016-06-27 18:29:01	Scruffy	It means to move somewhere else for establishing residence or business
2016-06-27 18:29:17	CraftedPbody	yeah to move somewhere else
2016-06-27 18:29:34	Scruffy	Oh, I see
2016-06-27 18:29:51	CraftedPbody	He's saying it's to hefty to move, so it's best to just eat it there
2016-06-27 18:29:57	Scruffy	Right, that makes sense
2016-06-27 18:30:00	Scruffy	Sounds good then!
2016-06-27 18:30:08	Scruffy	Oh, also, "far too"
2016-06-27 18:30:26	CraftedPbody	oh, thanks
2016-06-27 18:30:30	CraftedPbody	missed that
2016-06-27 18:30:31	Scruffy	Sorry, little things like that just always get me
2016-06-27 18:30:48	CraftedPbody	no, it's good you saw that
2016-06-27 18:32:54	CraftedPbody	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Colossal_Glowcap How's this?
2016-06-27 18:34:51	Scruffy	Great!
2016-06-27 18:35:01	Scruffy	I still love that image
2016-06-27 18:35:25	Scruffy	Although I don't think it has to be that large in the infobox
2016-06-27 18:35:30	Scruffy	Perhaps 250, 300 pixels?
2016-06-27 18:36:26	CraftedPbody	I lowered it to 250.
2016-06-27 18:36:33	CraftedPbody	which looks good
2016-06-27 18:37:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-27 18:38:32	CraftedPbody	That thing is probably not moving very fast... considering that it's being carried by a bud purple and red, a leaf blue, yellow, and white, and a flower wing...
2016-06-27 18:39:03	CraftedPbody	and it's only being supported by the bare minimum.
2016-06-27 18:39:38	Scruffy	heh, that's true
2016-06-27 18:41:18	CraftedPbody	even though the following AI is a bit different than the normal carrying treasure AI
2016-06-27 18:42:17	CraftedPbody	I should probably add that bit in

2016-06-27 19:23:46	CraftedPbody	I'm going to go back to trying to finish my Old is Gold Pikmin 3 challenge.
2016-06-27 19:24:05	Scruffy	Old is Gold?
2016-06-27 19:25:36	CraftedPbody	Basically you use the new pikmin as little as possible, and the original 3 are used as much as possible.
2016-06-27 19:26:05	Scruffy	Ah, neat!
2016-06-27 19:26:07	Marty2000	Oh, neat
2016-06-27 19:26:24	Scruffy	I was thinking of starting a challenge to grow as many Pikmin as possible in 99 days, and beat the game on the last
2016-06-27 19:27:20	CraftedPbody	if you pluck a flukeweed with a winged pikmin, you carry the fruit with a different collor
2016-06-27 19:27:25	CraftedPbody	color*
2016-06-27 19:27:46	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-27 19:28:31	CraftedPbody	and for alot of crystal things you would use bomb-rocks instead of rock pikmin.
2016-06-27 19:28:43	CraftedPbody	the crushblat for example
2016-06-27 19:29:13	CraftedPbody	so be back in a bit
2016-06-27 19:32:00	@Espyo	oh sorry, CraftedPbody
2016-06-27 19:32:02	@Espyo	I didn't reply yesterday
2016-06-27 19:32:04	@Espyo	Rocks are possible
2016-06-27 19:32:07	@Espyo	but not a big priority atm
2016-06-27 19:32:09	@Espyo	(on the engine)
2016-06-27 19:34:47	Scruffy	How is the next update going?
2016-06-27 19:42:34	@Espyo	just adding content at this point
2016-06-27 19:42:37	@Espyo	all done development-wise
2016-06-27 19:42:46	@Espyo	maybe a mid-July release?
2016-06-27 19:44:34	Scruffy	Awesome!
2016-06-27 19:44:45	Scruffy	I'll get back from Thessaloniki just in time

2016-06-27 20:00:33	@Espyo	this seems like it could be a pre-release image
2016-06-27 20:00:41	@Espyo	it's weird that it's taken with the quality that it is
2016-06-27 20:00:46	@Espyo	and of something so seemingly unimportant
2016-06-27 20:01:53	Marty2000	"To Twilight River" is also in the final version, if I recall correctly.
2016-06-27 20:04:40	@Espyo	aren't the buttons of the days themselves kinda different?
2016-06-27 20:05:02	Marty2000	I don't think so... I'll check on Youtube
2016-06-27 20:05:18	@Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?hidebots=0 ugh, see, this is exactly what I mean
2016-06-27 20:05:28	@Espyo	(Upload log) . . Link.Pichu (wall | contribs) uploaded "File:Pikmin - Bad Ending-1" ‎(created video)
2016-06-27 20:05:40	@Espyo	 1) Link.Pichu did not create the video, it's from youtube
2016-06-27 20:05:49	@Espyo	 2) Link.Pichu did not upload the video, the process simply links to it
2016-06-27 20:06:05	@Espyo	wikia just considers that thing on the "File:" namespace as a "video"
2016-06-27 20:06:18	@Espyo	and in the process, somewhere, it created an image, without categories or anything, to represent the thumbnail
2016-06-27 20:06:21	@Espyo	it's horribly disorganized

2016-06-27 20:09:54	Marty2000	Off-topic, but I found an effective way to outrange an E-liter 3K Scope :p

2016-06-27 20:10:25	Marty2000	12 Bomb Range Ups allows you to throw a bomb so far that you can reac the other side in Moray Towers
2016-06-27 20:10:37	Marty2000	It's fun to surprise them.
2016-06-27 20:13:54	@Espyo	WOW
2016-06-27 20:13:56	@Espyo	that's
2016-06-27 20:13:56	@Espyo	insane

2016-06-27 20:15:46	@Espyo	won't be as heavy, and still be mostly crisp
2016-06-27 20:16:53	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-27 20:17:00	Marty2000	Same for the spray images, then

2016-06-27 20:18:09	Marty2000	Okay, please wait...
2016-06-27 20:18:31	Marty2000	Also this http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:2PBattleMenu.png
2016-06-27 20:19:00	Marty2000	Oh, well, you already deleted them, but they were very similar, so...
2016-06-27 20:19:05	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-27 20:19:16	@Espyo	I used that one, turned it into a JPG, uploaded on top of the lower quality one
2016-06-27 20:19:20	@Espyo	and then deleted the unused PNG one
2016-06-27 20:19:56	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-27 20:31:38	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pink-Pikmin-in-Pikmin-3.jpg is this a lighting error, or is it really how it looked in the trailer?
2016-06-27 20:31:57	Marty2000	It looked like that in the trailer, let me see

2016-06-27 20:37:29	@Espyo	ah, okay
2016-06-27 20:37:39	@Espyo	then I guess it should go in the prerelease article

2016-06-27 21:42:45	@Espyo	there's just no nook you can't reach
2016-06-27 21:43:14	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-27 21:43:32	@Espyo	every throw you make is scary :/
2016-06-27 21:43:41	@Espyo	oh!
2016-06-27 21:43:44	@Espyo	you should take that online
2016-06-27 21:43:44	@Espyo	and
2016-06-27 21:43:54	@Espyo	there's this thing you can do on Moray Towers
2016-06-27 21:44:02	@Espyo	when the match is about to end, if you're on your respawn tower
2016-06-27 21:44:13	@Espyo	go down a bit to the top level that isn't your tower
2016-06-27 21:44:20	@Espyo	and then lob a grenade forward just as the timer reaches 0
2016-06-27 21:44:28	@Espyo	the game won't end until every last grenade bursts
2016-06-27 21:44:37	@Espyo	so it'll wait for your grenade to land before finishing
2016-06-27 21:44:48	@Espyo	when I do it, the grenade falls on the level below, I think
2016-06-27 21:44:52	@Espyo	but if you do it with this, it'll fall like 2 levels
2016-06-27 21:44:55	@Espyo	it'll take much longer
2016-06-27 21:45:03	Marty2000	Oh, okay, I'll try
2016-06-27 21:45:07	@Espyo	I THINK I actually managed to cause a disconnection one day by doing this!
2016-06-27 21:45:11	@Espyo	but it was in the early days of the game
2016-06-27 21:45:23	@Espyo	I could never get it to happen again, so they could've fixed dumb disconnections like that
2016-06-27 21:45:27	@Espyo	or maybe it was just coincidence
2016-06-27 21:45:39	Marty2000	Or maybe... what you told me :p
2016-06-27 21:45:39	@Espyo	it might have an even bigger effect with sticky bombs
2016-06-27 21:45:43	@Espyo	since they take longer to detonate
2016-06-27 21:45:52	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-27 21:45:59	Marty2000	I'll try with a Splash-o6matic
2016-06-27 21:46:05	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-27 21:46:05	Marty2000	o-Matic*
2016-06-27 21:46:08	@Espyo	but I think they don't reach as far
2016-06-27 21:46:18	@Espyo	so, try throwing one and following it down to see what path it takes
2016-06-27 21:52:01	Marty2000	Don't know if I did it correctly (uploading a video to show you) but the match lasted 8 seconds after the countdown had reached 0

2016-06-27 21:57:44	@Espyo	yay
2016-06-27 21:59:11	Marty2000	Surprisingly...
2016-06-27 21:59:15	Marty2000	it doesn't work with Sprinklers
2016-06-27 22:00:48	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-06-27 22:00:51	@Espyo	since they never timeout
2016-06-27 22:01:02	@Espyo	I wonder what happens with Seekers, though
2016-06-27 22:01:21	Marty2000	Nothing
2016-06-27 22:01:40	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/ijFePUbAi28
2016-06-27 22:02:03	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-27 22:10:59	Marty2000	Oh, also, with 12 Special Savers, you may respawn or not with your gauge still completly filled depending on the "Special Depletion" of your weapon. That makes sense, but it's still worth noting it
2016-06-27 22:11:55	Marty2000	So, with an Inkbrush Nouveau or a Neo-Sploosh-o-Matic... I can respawn with a Bubbler/Kraken ready to be used :p
2016-06-27 22:13:09	@Espyo	how's this for a P3-styled electric gate for the engine? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Electric_gate.png
2016-06-27 22:13:37	@Espyo	oh yeah, I've read about people doing that
2016-06-27 22:13:40	Marty2000	Oh, neat. It's similar
2016-06-27 22:14:02	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-27 22:14:06	@Espyo	ended up more pleasing than I thought

2016-06-27 22:25:47	Marty2000	Hmm, haven't done Pikmin science today. Is there any mystery that has no  (or little) explanation yet?
2016-06-27 22:25:58	@Espyo	millions
2016-06-27 22:26:05	@Espyo	can't think of any one today, though
2016-06-27 22:26:12	@Espyo	let me check the list...
2016-06-27 22:26:17	Marty2000	Hah, I see
2016-06-27 22:26:35	@Espyo	ooh, this one's a toughy
2016-06-27 22:26:37	@Espyo	in all three games...
2016-06-27 22:26:54	@Espyo	are 2 Pikmin twice as fast at taking down a gate compared to 1 Pikmin?
2016-06-27 22:27:03	@Espyo	are 3 three times faster? are 50 fifty times?
2016-06-27 22:27:20	Marty2000	Hmm, I could try, yeah
2016-06-27 22:28:11	Marty2000	I'll try P3 first
2016-06-27 22:29:22	Marty2000	More precisely, I'll try with the first gate we encounter in the Garden of Hope, and I'll try with Red Pikmin. I'll throw them in such a way that they won't latch onto the gate
2016-06-27 22:29:51	Marty2000	The first experiment (so, 1 Pikmin) will be tested twice, to see whether it's random or not.
2016-06-27 22:29:51	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-27 22:29:59	@Espyo	though I'd honestly recommend trying P1 first :P
2016-06-27 22:30:06	@Espyo	P3 is known to have insane specific cases
2016-06-27 22:30:16	@Espyo	I wouldn't be surprised if one gate works one way, only for the very next to work a different way
2016-06-27 22:30:28	@Espyo	yeah, good call on the double experiment
2016-06-27 22:31:39	Marty2000	Too late, I'm on P3 :p But don't worry, I have hours for that. By the way, I'm happy to have multiple complete saves now, this helps gain time, he he
2016-06-27 22:31:56	@Espyo	nice

2016-06-27 22:33:28	Marty2000	Ok, starting!
2016-06-27 22:41:38	Marty2000	Okay, so 1 Red Pikmin = (roughly) 7:48 min
2016-06-27 22:41:43	Marty2000	Let's retry to see if it was random
2016-06-27 22:41:59	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-27 22:43:44	Marty2000	During this time, I've thought of another thing: we may want to try finding the number of days it takes for each enemy to respawn, in each game
2016-06-27 22:43:55	Marty2000	I know certain things, though
2016-06-27 22:43:58	@Espyo	that'll take years...
2016-06-27 22:44:01	Marty2000	Like...
2016-06-27 22:44:04	@Espyo	I'd rather read the game's files and dump what they say
2016-06-27 22:44:21	Marty2000	The Dwarf Red Bulborbs respawn faster than a Red Bulborb in the Awakening Wood
2016-06-27 22:44:22	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-27 22:50:54	Marty2000	7 min 47
2016-06-27 22:51:00	Marty2000	It's the same, it's not random
2016-06-27 22:51:17	Marty2000	I don't think a one second difference makes it random
2016-06-27 22:51:41	Marty2000	It's probably because I pressed the button at different times (slight difference)
2016-06-27 22:51:54	Marty2000	SO I think it's totally safe to say it's not random in P3 ;)
2016-06-27 22:52:14	Marty2000	Okay, going to try with two Pikmin now
2016-06-27 22:52:18	Marty2000	Let us see...
2016-06-27 22:54:14	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-27 22:56:39	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-06-27 22:56:47	Marty2000	2 Pikmin = 3:64 min
2016-06-27 22:56:53	Marty2000	3:54 min*
2016-06-27 22:57:24	Marty2000	Seems two Pikmin are twice as fast, then
2016-06-27 22:57:48	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-06-27 22:57:57	Marty2000	I'll try with 3 Pikmin to make extra sure
2016-06-27 23:01:38	Marty2000	3 Pikmin = 2:46 min
2016-06-27 23:01:45	Marty2000	2:min 36
2016-06-27 23:01:52	Marty2000	Ooops, please, sorry
2016-06-27 23:01:56	Marty2000	2:36 min*
2016-06-27 23:02:17	Marty2000	So yeah, two Pikmin are twice as fast, three Pikmin are three times as fast... etc.
2016-06-27 23:05:33	Marty2000	Ok, I'll try P1 now, Espyo.
2016-06-27 23:07:56	Marty2000	I'll use Red Pikmin again, and the first gate encountered in the Forest of Hope
2016-06-27 23:08:18	Marty2000	I just hope the Pikmin will manage to destroy the gate alone
2016-06-27 23:08:45	@Espyo	I see
2016-06-27 23:08:50	@Espyo	but you could've tried 50 and 100
2016-06-27 23:08:53	@Espyo	just to make sure
2016-06-27 23:09:34	Marty2000	But I have to grow more Pikmin, though, and it isn't possible to grow so many unless you destroy this gate
2016-06-27 23:09:39	Marty2000	But I'll try later anyway
2016-06-27 23:09:43	Marty2000	Now, I'll test P1
2016-06-27 23:10:04	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-27 23:10:24	Marty2000	I'll do the same as I did beforehand: two experiments with a Pikmin to see whether it's random.
2016-06-27 23:10:37	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-27 23:15:30	Marty2000	Since the Pikmin seems to be taking forever, I'll stop when it has taken down one third of the gate, and retry. If it's random, I'll try to destroy the entire gate using more Pikmin
2016-06-27 23:15:41	@Espyo	yeah, might as well
2016-06-27 23:17:03	Marty2000	1 Pikmin = (roughly) 6:49-50 min
2016-06-27 23:17:10	Marty2000	Let's try with two Pikmin now
2016-06-27 23:17:59	Marty2000	Eh, no
2016-06-27 23:18:06	Marty2000	I mean, one Pikmin, to make sure it's not random :p
2016-06-27 23:18:10	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-27 23:25:17	Marty2000	I got the same time (6:49min)
2016-06-27 23:25:21	Marty2000	So, it's not random too :D
2016-06-27 23:25:44	Marty2000	Time to try with two Pikmin
2016-06-27 23:26:39	@Espyo	nice
2016-06-27 23:30:07	Marty2000	3:25 min
2016-06-27 23:30:15	Marty2000	So, two Pikmin are twice as fast as one Pikmin
2016-06-27 23:30:16	@Espyo	consistently linear
2016-06-27 23:30:40	Marty2000	Want me to try with more Pikmin? (up to 25)
2016-06-27 23:32:09	@Espyo	yeah, try 25
2016-06-27 23:33:14	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-27 23:35:26	Marty2000	Around 19 seconds
2016-06-27 23:41:05	@Espyo	let's see...
2016-06-27 23:41:24	@Espyo	 6:50 = 410 seconds
2016-06-27 23:41:31	@Espyo	 0:20 = 20 seconds :|
2016-06-27 23:41:39	@Espyo	 410/20 = 20
2016-06-27 23:41:42	@Espyo	so... not quite
2016-06-27 23:41:48	Marty2000	Yeah...
2016-06-27 23:42:11	Marty2000	I'll retry once again with 25 Pikmin
2016-06-27 23:42:23	Marty2000	If I get the same time, then.... heh :/
2016-06-27 23:42:31	@Espyo	Nintendo messing with us
2016-06-27 23:42:33	@Espyo	as per usual
2016-06-27 23:42:39	Marty2000	Yeah :D
2016-06-27 23:42:47	@Espyo	it needed to last 16 seconds in order to match up with linear speeds
2016-06-27 23:42:54	@Espyo	you're not throwing them at the gate, are you?
2016-06-27 23:44:04	Marty2000	No, I don't throw them, I use the group move in such a way (pointing at the gate) that they all begin attacking at once. And I got the same time :/

2016-06-27 23:44:19	@Espyo	right, right
2016-06-27 23:44:22	@Espyo	well, non-linear then
2016-06-27 23:44:31	@Espyo	could be linear with up to, say, 10 Pikmin, and then non-linear
2016-06-27 23:46:23	Marty2000	I'll try with 10 Pikmin, and then 11
2016-06-27 23:48:08	Marty2000	10 Pikmin = 45 seconds
2016-06-27 23:48:59	@Espyo	not linear
2016-06-27 23:49:03	@Espyo	should be 41
2016-06-27 23:49:13	Marty2000	Well, useless to try with 11 Pikmin then
2016-06-27 23:49:35	Marty2000	I guess I'll try with P2 now?
2016-06-27 23:49:52	@Espyo	might as well...
2016-06-27 23:50:36	Marty2000	Yeah, we'll see...

2016-06-27 23:59:17	Marty2000	Heh, sorry. They're carrying the Courage Detector back to the Ship. If you have to go, anyway, I'll write the results to your user talk page.
2016-06-27 23:59:26	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-27 23:59:32	@Espyo	no need, you can save them for tomorrow
2016-06-27 23:59:37	@Espyo	no need to clog up the recent pages with it

2016-06-28 00:02:57	Marty2000	Tomorrow is probably the last day on which I can do Pikmin science before a while, anyway. So, if you have anything you want me to try... tell me now.
2016-06-28 00:03:06	Marty2000	Right now, I'll take down a third of the gate with a Pikmin
2016-06-28 00:03:12	Marty2000	one third
2016-06-28 00:03:38	@Espyo	nothing off the top of my head...

2016-06-28 00:06:43	Marty2000	Good night
2016-06-28 00:06:49	@Espyo	we might need to gather up quite a few values, like 1 to 10, then every 10
2016-06-28 00:06:56	Marty2000	Okay, I'll do that
2016-06-28 00:07:05	@Espyo	and then try to see if we can find a tendency curve
2016-06-28 00:07:15	@Espyo	or if it's just random nonsense, like digging dirt mounds...

2016-06-28 01:41:54	Marty2000	Basically, this allows you to have the same range as an E-liter
2016-06-28 01:42:08	Marty2000	Since you are a Wasabi user, this would be useful for you (I think)
2016-06-28 01:43:01	@PikFan	hmm
2016-06-28 01:43:40	@PikFan	that means other than a crazy long bomb-throwing range, I'd be completely normal
2016-06-28 01:43:45	Marty2000	This is effective with Bomb Rush ;)
2016-06-28 01:43:52	@PikFan	this is true
