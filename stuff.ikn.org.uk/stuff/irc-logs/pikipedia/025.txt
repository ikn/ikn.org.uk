2016-03-31 22:33:09	@J	gives me a good idea of the effort required, I've been thinking about taking it up
2016-03-31 22:35:07	Neocraftz1553	How many times did you practice it, Scruffy?

2016-03-31 22:35:25	Scruffy	It's never too late to try it, J
2016-03-31 22:35:51	Scruffy	And if you do learn some classical theory early on, it really helps you learn faster
2016-03-31 22:36:09	@J	my brother had lessons when we were younger; I never did, just played around, downloaded some video-game scores and tried them out
2016-03-31 22:36:24	Scruffy	NeoCraftz1553:I probably practiced in parts this 40 times over the last week
2016-03-31 22:36:38	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-03-31 22:36:52	@Espyo	(@J)

2016-03-31 22:37:55	Neocraftz1553	 40 times?!?
2016-03-31 22:38:34	Yoshi2	that's more than 5 times per day
2016-03-31 22:39:06	Scruffy	Yep
2016-03-31 22:39:12	Scruffy	That sounds about right
2016-03-31 22:39:45	Scruffy	But I mean I it wasn't really "practicing," most of it was coming up with it by playing
2016-03-31 22:39:56	Scruffy	I still have yet to make it sheet music
2016-03-31 22:40:39	@Espyo	really? I figured you would have

2016-03-31 23:59:42	Scruffy	On the Pikipedia forums?
2016-03-31 23:59:46	@Espyo	yeah

2016-04-01 00:00:05	Scruffy	Can you give me the logo to give me some credibility?

2016-04-01 00:00:28	@Espyo	though since it's a joke
2016-04-01 00:00:32	@Espyo	post it without the logo first
2016-04-01 00:00:36	Scruffy	Alright
2016-04-01 00:00:37	@Espyo	then I'll create the threads in the meantime
2016-04-01 00:00:45	@Espyo	and I'll let you know the URL of the logo on the wiki
2016-04-01 00:00:52	@Espyo	long story short:
2016-04-01 00:01:00	@Espyo	Patrick wanted to write an article for Color Splash
2016-04-01 00:01:07	@Espyo	except he can't write wiki articles, and wrote a news article
2016-04-01 00:01:18	@Espyo	not wanting to let it go to waste, my idea was to have a forum thread about the new game
2016-04-01 00:01:31	Scruffy	Oh neat
2016-04-01 00:01:39	@Espyo	then somewhere in there, we say that something like Gamenesia had an article on Color Splash, but got deleted, and ask if somebody had it saved somewhere
2016-04-01 00:01:44	@Espyo	and one of us posts what Patrick made
2016-04-01 00:02:00	@Espyo	and we can use that as a source for one or two statements in the article
2016-04-01 00:02:17	Scruffy	Wait, should I say "Nintendo just revealed Pikmin: Color Splash?"
2016-04-01 00:02:21	Scruffy	Or just Color Splash
2016-04-01 00:02:26	@Espyo	the full name, sure
2016-04-01 00:03:18	Scruffy	Agh, I can't create news articles there
2016-04-01 00:03:25	Scruffy	It'll have to go in "Discussion"
2016-04-01 00:03:30	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-01 00:03:31	@Espyo	oh well
2016-04-01 00:05:40	Scruffy	Ok how's this sound?
2016-04-01 00:05:41	Scruffy	I just read about this today; apparently it's not just a rumor. I guess they realized Pikmin 4's going to take longer than they thought.
2016-04-01 00:05:54	@Espyo	oh, actually
2016-04-01 00:05:57	@Espyo	this IS Pikmin 4
2016-04-01 00:06:01	@Espyo	I mean
2016-04-01 00:06:01	Scruffy	Ohhh
2016-04-01 00:06:04	@Espyo	I never really thought about it
2016-04-01 00:06:11	@Espyo	but we'll just pretend like it's a new game, period
2016-04-01 00:06:21	@Espyo	we don't really know the title of the current Pikmin 4, honestly
2016-04-01 00:06:27	@Espyo	so try to avoid references to P4
2016-04-01 00:07:15	Scruffy	Okay how's this
2016-04-01 00:07:17	Scruffy	I just read about this today; apparently it's not just a rumor. I guess they want to take Pikmin in a new direction, after the ideas they got from Paper Mario Color Splash. What do you guys think? I'm not sure how to feel.
2016-04-01 00:07:38	@Espyo	let's pretend that it's not related to Paper Mario Color Splash in the slightest
2016-04-01 00:07:40	@Espyo	that's part of the joke
2016-04-01 00:07:41	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-04-01 00:07:49	@Espyo	anything simple will do, really
2016-04-01 00:07:59	@Espyo	the article is more or less an excuse to post Patrick's article
2016-04-01 00:08:55	Scruffy	Heh alright
2016-04-01 00:08:55	Scruffy	So just "I just read about this today; apparently it's not just a rumor. I guess they want to take Pikmin in a new direction; what do you guys think? I'm not sure how to feel."
2016-04-01 00:08:55	Scruffy	Wait sorry
2016-04-01 00:08:55	Scruffy	I just read about this today; apparently it's not just a rumor. I'm not sure how to feel about it, what do you guys think?

2016-04-01 00:10:46	Scruffy	well, actually, never mind
2016-04-01 00:11:55	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that

2016-04-01 00:25:35	@Espyo	quite a few words that are normal in Portuguese actually have almost direct parallels in English that are much rarer
2016-04-01 00:25:51	@Espyo	so when you learn one of them, it just sticks with you because "hey, that word I'm so familiar with actually has an English parallel"

2016-04-01 12:27:23	Klemen702	i think it was taken too seriously as a concept instead of humour...
2016-04-01 12:31:13	Yoshi2	pikmin colour splash is pretty obviously satire if you are familiar with paper mario color splash and its predecessor
2016-04-01 12:32:27	Klemen702	i know about stickerstar and colorsplash
2016-04-01 12:32:40	Klemen702	but i didn't really think much of this page
2016-04-01 12:32:55	Klemen702	finished reading pik-min and NCU and didn't find anything good
2016-04-01 12:33:40	Klemen702	might be my humour but the bolbert page is the only good one atm
2016-04-01 12:33:48	Klemen702	and that's last years
2016-04-01 12:35:46	Yoshi2	well, it's less humour and more "holy crap this could be an actual thing if somebody at nintendo went crazy"
2016-04-01 12:36:18	Klemen702	wait
2016-04-01 12:36:22	Klemen702	which are you talking about?
2016-04-01 12:36:37	Yoshi2	pikmin colorsplash/pik-min/NCU
2016-04-01 12:36:45	Klemen702	yeah
2016-04-01 12:36:52	Klemen702	that's a point that i agree with

2016-04-01 19:49:11	Neocraftz1553	link?
2016-04-01 19:49:24	@Espyo	Bolbert was a masterpiece
2016-04-01 19:49:32	Neocraftz1553	found it
2016-04-01 19:49:33	@Espyo	which sucks, since it reduced the quality of all subsequent jokes
2016-04-01 19:52:22	Yoshi2	pik-min was pretty well done, I love the poster
2016-04-01 19:52:38	Klemen702	only the poster is good in my opinion
2016-04-01 19:52:41	Klemen702	but u already know
2016-04-01 19:53:31	Neocraftz1553	It's pretty dark
2016-04-01 19:53:42	Yoshi2	copy&pasting something I said earlier this morning
2016-04-01 19:53:53	Yoshi2	well, it's less humour and more "holy crap this could be an actual thing if somebody at nintendo went crazy"
2016-04-01 19:54:24	@Espyo	loosen up
2016-04-01 19:54:38	@Espyo	the joke is in the parallels between it and Ant-Man
2016-04-01 19:55:14	Klemen702	it's an adult joke
2016-04-01 19:55:19	Klemen702	we need more 12 year old kids jokes

2016-04-01 19:57:29	Klemen702	i forgot Testyo is only 3-4 years old
2016-04-01 19:57:30	Testyo	I'm playing Truth or Dare with my friends

2016-04-01 20:14:34	Scruffy	The April Fools day jokes turned out really great
2016-04-01 20:14:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-01 20:14:45	@Espyo	next year...
2016-04-01 20:14:49	@Espyo	we ARE gonna work on this in advance
2016-04-01 20:14:51	Scruffy	I didn't know all NIWA would be in on the Cinematic Universe thing
2016-04-01 20:14:56	@Espyo	I am NOT working on another joke with like 2 days to go
2016-04-01 20:15:01	@Espyo	not all NIWA
2016-04-01 20:15:02	Scruffy	Heh
2016-04-01 20:15:04	@Espyo	in fact... most didn't do anything
2016-04-01 20:15:05	Scruffy	Oh
2016-04-01 20:15:12	@Espyo	just SmashWiki and Mario Wiki, that I know of
2016-04-01 20:15:26	@Espyo	Zelda Wiki showed interest, but died
2016-04-01 20:16:20	@Espyo	oh, btw
2016-04-01 20:16:24	@Espyo	the Plasm Wraith remix?
2016-04-01 20:16:27	@Espyo	OCRemix material right there
2016-04-01 20:16:29	Marty2000	But the poster is great anyway
2016-04-01 20:17:19	Scruffy	heh, thank you!
2016-04-01 20:17:37	@Espyo	try to submit it
2016-04-01 20:17:42	@Espyo	they have pretty tight regulations
2016-04-01 20:17:45	@Espyo	but check them out
2016-04-01 20:18:06	Scruffy	At first I wanted to write something to go with the Pikmin karting video (since it's in the Formidable Oak) but it got too much fun for just that
2016-04-01 20:18:16	Scruffy	Oh yeah, I'll look them up
2016-04-01 20:18:39	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-01 20:19:02	@Espyo	I think the main problem you'll run into is that songs should be at least 2 and a half minutes long
2016-04-01 20:19:05	@Espyo	that's paraphrasing
2016-04-01 20:19:08	@Espyo	and that's just my memory
2016-04-01 20:19:13	@Espyo	and that's from at least 5 years ago
2016-04-01 20:23:10	Scruffy	They apparently *strongly* *recommend* it be at least 2 minutes long, or else it's difficult to process and probably won't be featured
2016-04-01 20:24:01	@Espyo	right...
2016-04-01 20:24:04	@Espyo	this doesn't count loops
2016-04-01 20:24:09	Scruffy	What I really want to do is insert this music in Pikmin 3
2016-04-01 20:24:48	Scruffy	and battle the Plasm Wraith to it
2016-04-01 20:26:05	@Espyo	yeeeeesss

2016-04-02 00:09:39	@Espyo	I think that if Nintendo were to sue, they'd have done it already
2016-04-02 00:09:47	@Espyo	Fanon is a party of lawsuit material
2016-04-02 00:09:53	@Espyo	me? I'm just making a simple program that emulates the logic
2016-04-02 00:10:11	@Espyo	biggest problem about that is simply that I also package some copyrighted material (sounds, graphics), but that's pretty meh
2016-04-02 00:10:17	@PikFan	better safe than sorry
2016-04-02 00:10:23	@Espyo	plus, while Dolphin stays up, I refuse to be tore down
2016-04-02 00:10:38	@Espyo	if Dolphin, which is easily Nintendo's #1 threat, is up all this time without so much as a shake
2016-04-02 00:10:52	@Espyo	then how would I, the simple programmer making code from scratch, get hit?
2016-04-02 00:10:53	@Espyo	fat chance
2016-04-02 00:11:25	@PikFan	you know that Twilight Princess HD fan project that was going on?
2016-04-02 00:11:27	@PikFan	that got hit
2016-04-02 00:11:36	@PikFan	Nintendo took down all their videos
2016-04-02 00:11:47	@PikFan	and now it's on hiatus
2016-04-02 00:12:17	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-04-02 00:12:22	@Espyo	my point about Dolphin still stands strong
2016-04-02 00:12:28	@Espyo	plus, TPHD is a proper threat to their sales
2016-04-02 00:12:41	@Espyo	it directly competes with a product that's the same thing
2016-04-02 00:12:49	@Espyo	and is pretty much entirely copyrighted material flying left and right
2016-04-02 00:12:57	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-04-02 00:13:04	@Espyo	plus, unless the guys did it right, that fan project would give people a free ticket to play TPHD
2016-04-02 00:13:06	@Espyo	my engine?
2016-04-02 00:13:14	@Espyo	the day my engine topples Nintendo is the day I transcend mortality

2016-04-02 16:16:47	Marty2000	Hey!
2016-04-02 16:17:10	Scruffy	Hi Marty
2016-04-02 16:17:24	Marty2000	Hi
2016-04-02 16:24:31	Marty2000	Oh, I managed to get a Winged Pikmin covered by the ink of a Sputtlefish! That was hard! I don't remember any place where you can get a Winged Pikmin "poisoned" by an enemy
2016-04-02 16:25:45	Scruffy	Wow
2016-04-02 16:26:05	Scruffy	Did it remain in the air? Or did it sink into the water?
2016-04-02 16:26:14	Marty2000	I'm going to upload that to Youtube
2016-04-02 16:26:18	Marty2000	It remained in the air
2016-04-02 16:26:22	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-04-02 16:27:22	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-02 16:27:59	Marty2000	Too bad we can't try with Whites...
2016-04-02 16:29:29	Scruffy	We'd need to have a Toady Bloyster near them
2016-04-02 16:29:29	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-04-02 16:29:33	@Espyo	for the time being, anyway
2016-04-02 16:29:46	@Espyo	if CEMU evolves at the pace it's going...
2016-04-02 16:29:58	@Espyo	in some months, we'll be able to change files in the game and test the changes
2016-04-02 16:30:05	Scruffy	I'm glad they at least kept White Pikmin being poisonous
2016-04-02 16:30:06	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-04-02 16:30:19	Marty2000	That would be great!
2016-04-02 16:32:50	Marty2000	The WInged Pikmin is quite strange when covered in ink... its eyes aren't compound
2016-04-02 16:33:36	Scruffy	Ooh interesting
2016-04-02 16:34:13	@Espyo	definitely
2016-04-02 16:34:20	@Espyo	btw Marty, don't be shy about adding your discoveries to the wiki
2016-04-02 16:34:31	@Espyo	most of them are super interesting stuff, and it's a shame seeing them not be on the wiki

2016-04-02 16:34:48	Marty2000	Yes, sure
2016-04-02 16:35:02	@Espyo	hm, looks just like the other Pikmin
2016-04-02 16:35:03	Marty2000	That's what I was going to do, actually
2016-04-02 16:35:15	Marty2000	Their "sound" is different, though
2016-04-02 16:35:19	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-04-02 16:35:33	Scruffy	Interesting that the ink can hit Winged Pikmin in the first place
2016-04-02 16:36:02	@Espyo	mhm, I was thinking that
2016-04-02 16:36:23	Marty2000	The timing is quite hard to get them poisoned, they must be drowning
2016-04-02 16:36:30	Marty2000	And a leader has to whistle them
2016-04-02 16:36:48	Marty2000	It's possible to drown a Winged Pikmin without throwing them into the water
2016-04-02 16:36:54	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-02 16:38:14	Scruffy	Oh yeah, do you hold them and then walk in the water?
2016-04-02 16:38:31	Marty2000	No
2016-04-02 16:38:41	Marty2000	I hold a Blue Pikmin, then change the type
2016-04-02 16:39:08	Scruffy	ah

2016-04-02 17:35:52	Marty2000	So White Pikmin can actually get poisoned in Pikmin 3
2016-04-02 17:35:57	Marty2000	I managed to test it
2016-04-02 17:36:06	Marty2000	In Beastly Caverns
2016-04-02 17:36:56	StarWolf	that's kinda cool, but it makes sense that they would get poisoned.  
2016-04-02 17:38:00	UltraMario	wtf
2016-04-02 17:39:00	Marty2000	Well, actually they can get covered in ink,  but it is similar to poison

2016-04-02 17:52:09	StarWolf	Well, Marty2000, poison ISN'T in Pikmin 3. So why would Nintendo program it in?

2016-04-02 17:54:15	@Espyo	likely not true poison

2016-04-02 17:54:42	StarWolf	yah! In Pikmin 2, (as far as I remember) the only poison came from the Doodle Bug and those pipes

2016-04-02 17:55:18	StarWolf	And the final boss...

2016-04-02 18:47:04	Nvortex	that split second they stay in the air, when they fall if there was no target they fall slower
2016-04-02 18:48:02	Nvortex	i bet they arent imune to it either
2016-04-02 18:51:06	Marty2000	Maybe
2016-04-02 18:51:31	Marty2000	When hacks come out, we'll be able to test with a Toady Bloyster

2016-04-02 19:15:47	@J	a terrible thing happened
2016-04-02 19:16:03	@J	I dropped my dinner while taking it out of the oven
2016-04-02 19:16:23	@J	I'm lucky the dish didn't break, and I'm also lucky I made two
2016-04-02 19:16:28	@J	but that is a huge mess
2016-04-02 19:19:42	Yoshi2	what is it with you and dropping dishes
2016-04-02 19:20:31	UltraMario	heh
2016-04-02 19:22:33	@J	what do you mean?  I never did that before
2016-04-02 19:26:26	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure you dropped food once before
2016-04-02 19:28:34	@Espyo	hey, statistically, that was bound to happen eventually
2016-04-02 19:42:58	@J	great, potato managed to get behind the glass over the door, so I'm going to have to unscrew it
2016-04-02 19:43:53	@Espyo	I know we have people that are familiar with American English and people familiar with British English in here
2016-04-02 19:44:07	@Espyo	hence why you shouldn't simply say "fries", "chips", or "crisps"
2016-04-02 19:44:16	@Espyo	but please don't call whatever it is a "potato"
2016-04-02 19:44:22	@Espyo	unless it's actually AN ENTIRE POTATO
2016-04-02 19:44:26	@Espyo	p-please tell me it's an entire potato

2016-04-02 19:46:15	@J	no way a whole potato would fit in that gap
2016-04-02 19:46:27	Yoshi2	I want to imagine that an entire potato got behind the glass
2016-04-02 19:46:49	@Espyo	precisely
2016-04-02 19:46:50	@J	and it's somehow not squashed, looking at it is like a hologram
2016-04-02 19:47:27	@Espyo	potato of the future
2016-04-02 19:49:58	Scruffy	?
2016-04-02 19:50:17	Yoshi2	hologram potato
2016-04-02 19:50:24	Scruffy	ah, of course
2016-04-02 19:50:30	@J	hologram potato, what part don't you understand?
2016-04-02 19:50:57	Scruffy	makes perfect sense now
2016-04-02 19:57:42	Testyo	means "by died

2016-04-03 12:56:35	Yoshi2	just need to glue it together in a image editing program which I hopefully have enough skills for
2016-04-03 12:57:12	Yoshi2	could actually make an animated banner because the game has that too, but that requires a custom css
2016-04-03 12:58:08	Yoshi2	animated banner would pretty damn dope though

2016-04-04 19:54:48	Neocraftz1553	I kept on disconnecting when I asked this question, but...
2016-04-04 19:55:04	Neocraftz1553	will there be automated tasks in the PFE?
2016-04-04 19:55:12	Neocraftz1553	and customizable carrying paths?
2016-04-04 19:55:24	Neocraftz1553	and by customizable I mean...
2016-04-04 19:55:59	Neocraftz1553	like, certain pikmin can go through them, others will just drop their load, yet, other paths are for automated tasks
2016-04-04 19:56:33	@Espyo	I did answer, but I guess you never received it
2016-04-04 19:56:38	@Espyo	you should take a look at your connection
2016-04-04 19:56:40	@Espyo	you really disconnect a lot
2016-04-04 19:56:45	@Espyo	anyway yeah, I have plans to implement that
2016-04-04 19:56:53	@Espyo	customizable carrying paths, maybe not so much
2016-04-04 19:56:59	@Espyo	but I'll think about the carrying paths a bit better with time

2016-04-04 20:02:08	CreativeSushi	the problem is that there are a lot of counterfeit Sanei plushes out there
2016-04-04 20:02:18	CreativeSushi	even more on eBay then amazon

2016-04-04 20:44:08	CreativeSushi	Where on the Wiki should that info be put?

2016-04-04 21:08:30	@Espyo	but if I try to run the engine under Wine here (Linux)
2016-04-04 21:08:34	@Espyo	I also get invisible PNGs
2016-04-04 21:08:37	@Espyo	sorry, invisible JPGs
2016-04-04 21:08:38	ScruffyChat	Woah
2016-04-04 21:08:41	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-04-04 21:08:51	@Espyo	it's such a... specific problem
2016-04-04 21:08:57	@Espyo	and it looks like it shouldn't be
2016-04-04 21:09:07	@Espyo	hm, maybe it works if I use OpenGL
2016-04-04 21:09:20	@Espyo	see, Allegro can make games that run on either DirectX or OpenGL on the fly
2016-04-04 21:09:26	@Espyo	it just decides the second you start the program
2016-04-04 21:09:31	@Espyo	which is weirdly powerful but ok
2016-04-04 21:09:41	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-04 21:09:45	@Espyo	I can force one of the two though, and since windows uses DirectX by default, and Wine is emulating windows...
2016-04-04 21:09:57	@Espyo	but then the problem should happen in windows natively as well
2016-04-04 21:10:03	@Espyo	maybe it's just a specific Wine + DirectX combination
2016-04-04 21:10:49	ScruffyChat	Perhaps

2016-04-04 21:12:32	Neocraftz1553	I rendered it in cycles, took me 2 hours to render...
2016-04-04 21:12:43	Neocraftz1553	about an hour to texture and map...
2016-04-04 21:12:47	Neocraftz1553	It looks ok
2016-04-04 21:12:56	Neocraftz1553	I even made a Laptop
2016-04-04 21:13:01	Neocraftz1553	to put in it
2016-04-04 21:13:23	Neocraftz1553	Problem is, I don't know where to put it, should I uploaded it, or....
2016-04-04 21:13:27	@Espyo	>Apparently s3tc is not enabled by default in the mesa drivers. You need to add "force_s3tc_enable=true" to force the environment to support the compressed s3 textures before running the game. So, for example, in my case I'd type "force_s3tc_enable=true wine eve.exe" This forces the mesa drivers to load the copyright-protected s3tc lib support and render textures properly.
2016-04-04 21:13:30	@Espyo	this didn't work for me
2016-04-04 21:13:35	Neocraftz1553	and what should I name it once uploaded?
2016-04-04 21:16:01	ScruffyChat	Hmm

2016-04-04 21:18:24	ScruffyChat	Where did you input the command?
2016-04-04 21:18:36	ScruffyChat	In Allegro or in Wine's console?

2016-04-04 23:07:17	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy
2016-04-04 23:07:47	ScruffyChat	Hi
2016-04-04 23:07:57	ScruffyChat	I just put the link on your talk page if you need it
2016-04-04 23:08:05	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks
2016-04-04 23:08:14	ScruffyChat	Although you said you'd be on mobile now, so I guess you can't use it yet
2016-04-04 23:08:16	Neocraftz1553	I am downloading it right now
2016-04-04 23:08:20	ScruffyChat	Ah ok
2016-04-04 23:08:26	Neocraftz1553	let me test it
2016-04-04 23:08:43	Neocraftz1553	No biggie, I'll just use a USB cable
2016-04-04 23:09:46	Neocraftz1553	Also, thanks for the feedback on the KHA Lander, I really appreciated it... brightened up my day
2016-04-04 23:10:01	ScruffyChat	No problem!
2016-04-04 23:10:18	ScruffyChat	I also just uploaded the Onion kart collection

2016-04-04 23:12:44	Neocraftz1553	You're welcome
2016-04-04 23:13:25	Neocraftz1553	Yesterday I did some work on a PS2... but it seems tge disc drive is broken
2016-04-04 23:13:32	Neocraftz1553	I'll have to replace it
2016-04-04 23:14:08	Neocraftz1553	It has this little wheel with 64+ notches and I tried all 64...
2016-04-04 23:14:43	Neocraftz1553	Take out disc drive cover, turn notch, connect PS2, test, turn off PS2, disconnect, repeat
2016-04-04 23:15:08	Neocraftz1553	Oh, and put back disc drive cover...
2016-04-04 23:15:15	Neocraftz1553	safety purposes, see?
2016-04-04 23:15:25	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-04 23:15:36	Neocraftz1553	Laser radiation..
2016-04-04 23:16:12	Neocraftz1553	Stayed up till 1:30 doing that...
2016-04-04 23:16:37	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, I have my own PS2, and it works, so...
2016-04-04 23:16:54	Neocraftz1553	Had to fix the other one for a friend
2016-04-04 23:17:49	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-04 23:17:58	Neocraftz1553	Ok, testing tge Spiderwort
2016-04-04 23:18:36	Neocraftz1553	OOOOOH, the secret has been revealed
2016-04-04 23:18:59	Neocraftz1553	You used a texture, I should have remembered Pikmin Forever Cycles :p
2016-04-04 23:19:13	Neocraftz1553	It had a maple leaf remember?
2016-04-04 23:19:17	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-04-04 23:19:42	Neocraftz1553	Also, I need a new mouse, Scroll button is getting messed up
2016-04-04 23:20:21	Neocraftz1553	Wow dude, you're very creative
2016-04-04 23:20:32	ScruffyChat	Heh, it's not my design though
2016-04-04 23:20:38	Neocraftz1553	used a Gradient texture, that is awsome
2016-04-04 23:20:52	Neocraftz1553	still, its cool
2016-04-04 23:21:04	Neocraftz1553	I'm talking about shaders
2016-04-04 23:21:14	Neocraftz1553	But you're skilled at modeling too
2016-04-04 23:21:18	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2016-04-04 23:21:27	Neocraftz1553	yw
2016-04-04 23:21:47	Neocraftz1553	Now, all thats left is...
2016-04-04 23:22:04	Neocraftz1553	to incorperate it into a Toady Bloyster and hope it looks good
2016-04-04 23:22:18	ScruffyChat	Feel free to edit the model or shaders to experiment
2016-04-04 23:22:29	Neocraftz1553	Basically the equivalent of stabbing the plant into a Bloyster
2016-04-04 23:22:36	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks
2016-04-04 23:22:40	ScruffyChat	I designed it keeping in mind that it would be in the background of a low-DOF render
2016-04-04 23:23:06	Neocraftz1553	I'll make copies, so I'll have the original for reference
2016-04-04 23:23:11	ScruffyChat	Er, not designed, but modeled
2016-04-04 23:23:15	ScruffyChat	Ok
2016-04-04 23:23:17	Neocraftz1553	low-DOF?
2016-04-04 23:23:23	ScruffyChat	low-depth-of-field
2016-04-04 23:23:34	Neocraftz1553	ah, close up
2016-04-04 23:23:40	Neocraftz1553	the err...
2016-04-04 23:23:54	Neocraftz1553	well both ish
2016-04-04 23:24:08	Neocraftz1553	Focusing on close things, right?
2016-04-04 23:24:20	Neocraftz1553	How do you do that in blender?
2016-04-04 23:24:35	ScruffyChat	There should be a section in the Cycles menu for cameras
2016-04-04 23:24:59	ScruffyChat	In the same menu where you set whether its perspective or orthographic, the field of vision
2016-04-04 23:25:17	ScruffyChat	The section is called "Depth of Field"
2016-04-04 23:25:23	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok
2016-04-04 23:25:35	ScruffyChat	You can select an object to focus on, or choose an aperture distance
2016-04-04 23:25:53	ScruffyChat	And then "size" selects the depth of the lens
2016-04-04 23:26:02	Neocraftz1553	I usually use the default
2016-04-04 23:26:06	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-04-04 23:26:32	ScruffyChat	But on a scale like Pikmin, it actually helps to use it to convey the "small" effect
2016-04-04 23:26:37	ScruffyChat	Not overuse it though
2016-04-04 23:27:14	Neocraftz1553	what do you usually use?
2016-04-04 23:27:29	ScruffyChat	For Pikmin scenes, it depends
2016-04-04 23:27:31	ScruffyChat	Hang on
2016-04-04 23:27:49	Neocraftz1553	ok

2016-04-04 23:32:51	Neocraftz1553	Can a Toady Bloysters mouth even work physically?
2016-04-04 23:33:01	Neocraftz1553	with the tongue and stuff...
2016-04-04 23:33:05	ScruffyChat	In real life or in Blender?
2016-04-04 23:33:42	Neocraftz1553	Irl
2016-04-04 23:34:03	ScruffyChat	I'm pretty sure
2016-04-04 23:34:14	ScruffyChat	They look like arborescent tentacles
2016-04-04 23:34:15	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure it... well... maybe, if it had extra nerves, vessels, and ten...
2016-04-04 23:34:19	Neocraftz1553	tendrils?
2016-04-04 23:34:23	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-04 23:34:27	ScruffyChat	Or tendrils
2016-04-04 23:34:34	ScruffyChat	Kind of like a sea cucumber
2016-04-04 23:34:35	Neocraftz1553	maybe
2016-04-04 23:35:01	Neocraftz1553	maybe it evolved tentacles of some sort in its mouth, maybe its not even a tongue
2016-04-04 23:35:26	ScruffyChat	It never really had a tongue in the first place
2016-04-04 23:36:04	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-04-04 23:36:27	Neocraftz1553	A sea cucumber that shits out stick intestines that distract predators :p

2016-04-04 23:36:55	Neocraftz1553	but yeah, maybe it functions somewhat like a sea star
2016-04-04 23:37:10	Neocraftz1553	Throwing up its stomache/intestines 
2016-04-04 23:39:55	Neocraftz1553	Fireflies!! :o

2016-04-04 23:40:20	Neocraftz1553	*Fireflies
2016-04-04 23:40:55	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-04 23:41:17	ScruffyChat	Sometimes you can get rid of the subtle ones using the Soften filter node
2016-04-04 23:41:43	ScruffyChat	In post-processing, you add the "Filter" node from the "Filter" node selection
2016-04-04 23:42:10	ScruffyChat	And it'll soften the whole image, eliminating some fireflies at the cost of other tiny details that may have been present
2016-04-04 23:43:10	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok
2016-04-04 23:43:29	Neocraftz1553	I usually use Filter Glossy and Indirect Clamp 1
2016-04-04 23:46:11	Neocraftz1553	Ok, modeling the Berry Bloyster
2016-04-04 23:46:32	Neocraftz1553	I want it to have some more physical changes besides the tail
2016-04-04 23:46:35	ScruffyChat	Neat
2016-04-04 23:46:37	Neocraftz1553	err... gills
2016-04-04 23:47:13	Neocraftz1553	How do you tone down bump mapping?
2016-04-04 23:47:24	Neocraftz1553	makes harsh reflections and shadows...
2016-04-04 23:51:10	ScruffyChat	You can put it through a Math node, in the Converter node group
2016-04-04 23:51:20	ScruffyChat	Set the math node to multiply
2016-04-04 23:51:27	ScruffyChat	or divide
2016-04-04 23:51:36	Neocraftz1553	mhm... ok, setting it
2016-04-04 23:54:05	Neocraftz1553	setting it so harsh it looks I modeled it onto it
2016-04-04 23:54:17	Neocraftz1553	but, I thing I got it

2016-04-05 00:14:53	Neocraftz1553	because the Berry Bloyster has no reference picture

2016-04-05 00:19:52	Neocraftz1553	I need to copy the particle system...
2016-04-05 00:21:09	ScruffyChat	you could also convert the particles to an objecty
2016-04-05 00:21:09	ScruffyChat	In the Modifiers menu

2016-04-05 00:28:49	Neocraftz1553	Added small berries to it...
2016-04-05 00:29:28	Neocraftz1553	might make them green so that they look like unripened berries...
2016-04-05 00:29:35	Neocraftz1553	between the red berries, I mean
2016-04-05 00:30:55	ScruffyChat	Nice

2016-04-05 00:35:03	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-04-05 00:36:01	Neocraftz1553	I thought you used a texture from P3
2016-04-05 00:37:30	Neocraftz1553	Why are there huge depressions on the berries
2016-04-05 00:37:37	Neocraftz1553	the have very deep shadows
2016-04-05 00:37:42	Neocraftz1553	how to fix?
2016-04-05 00:42:13	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-04-05 00:42:39	ScruffyChat	Try taking the Musgrave texture off the Displacement output in the berry material
2016-04-05 00:43:08	ScruffyChat	And I didn't use any p3 textures, I only had a photo of Spiderworts to work with, not the model

2016-04-05 00:48:07	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-04-05 00:48:27	ScruffyChat	I tried a mix between p2 and p3 berries
2016-04-05 00:48:38	ScruffyChat	Where they're spherical but not perfectly so
2016-04-05 00:52:04	Neocraftz1553	and, how longvdid it take to model it?
2016-04-05 00:54:19	Neocraftz1553	brb, going to check something, stay tuned, I'm almost done
2016-04-05 00:54:55	ScruffyChat	about 30-45 minutes, I'd say
2016-04-05 00:58:26	Neocraftz1553	Ok, so instead of using the normal texture I used a Noise texture Fac and mixed two colors like that
2016-04-05 00:58:26	Neocraftz1553	just expirementing with colors right now
2016-04-05 00:59:36	Neocraftz1553	wow

2016-04-05 01:10:48	Neocraftz1553	I used a wave texture on the eyes...

2016-04-05 19:05:27	Yoshi2	I recently made the bw sub slightly more welcoming by adding a banner made of art I shamelessly stole from the games' files \o/

2016-04-05 19:05:44	UltraMario	i think ive heard of that series
2016-04-05 19:05:57	UltraMario	i wonder why it's familiar :p
2016-04-05 19:07:02	@Espyo	ah, sure looks cozier
2016-04-05 19:07:26	Yoshi2	it's like advance wars except with no anime, everything is 3D, it's 3rd person real time strategy, no towns that add income, etc. etc. etc.

2016-04-05 20:01:35	UltraMario	im working on a mariowiki proposal
2016-04-05 20:03:28	UltraMario	anyone wanna know what it's about? :P
2016-04-05 20:04:26	Yoshi2	what is it? :o
2016-04-05 20:05:18	UltraMario	oh you
2016-04-05 20:05:18	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-05 20:05:26	UltraMario	you know about it already, silly
2016-04-05 20:06:31	Scruffy	Mariowiki proposal?
2016-04-05 20:06:36	Scruffy	Sure, what's it about?
2016-04-05 20:06:45	UltraMario	well
2016-04-05 20:07:16	UltraMario	basically i want to make subpages for official stats and bios for the game articles when they have more added to them
2016-04-05 20:07:20	UltraMario	hm
2016-04-05 20:07:29	UltraMario	just thought of something
2016-04-05 20:07:51	UltraMario	what if i added more to them, and THEN people would see how much it lengthens the page?
2016-04-05 20:07:51	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-05 20:08:18	UltraMario	atm there isnt much bios for game articles like there is for characters
2016-04-05 20:08:24	UltraMario	so it's not too necessary
2016-04-05 20:08:34	UltraMario	but like plenty of articles are missing them
2016-04-05 20:08:40	UltraMario	so *shrugs*
2016-04-05 20:09:23	UltraMario	it's rather trivial, but i feel it'd benefit the wiki
2016-04-05 20:11:52	UltraMario	thoughts?

2016-04-05 20:19:32	UltraMario	maybe i should wait before more things get added to them though
2016-04-05 20:19:35	UltraMario	so my point is stronger

2016-04-05 20:23:09	UltraMario	a proposal im thinking of doing on mariowiki

2016-04-05 20:24:08	Scruffy	Hi PikFan!
2016-04-05 20:24:15	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-04-05 20:24:47	Yoshi2	the only thing I'm concerned about is that you are simply copying text from other websites
2016-04-05 20:24:58	UltraMario	but
2016-04-05 20:25:01	UltraMario	i am
2016-04-05 20:25:02	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-05 20:25:08	UltraMario	that's what these articles are
2016-04-05 20:25:09	Klemen702	you lazy ass
2016-04-05 20:25:20	UltraMario	the bios from the websites
2016-04-05 20:25:31	Yoshi2	text that isn't yours
2016-04-05 20:25:36	UltraMario	it's like that one the pages for the characters
2016-04-05 20:25:37	UltraMario	yes
2016-04-05 20:25:58	UltraMario	that's why it's in quotations
2016-04-05 20:25:59	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-05 20:26:02	Yoshi2	copyright infringment
2016-04-05 20:26:29	UltraMario	eh, i dunno
2016-04-05 20:27:08	UltraMario	this page for example has website descriptions

2016-04-05 20:27:11	UltraMario	:V
2016-04-05 20:27:19	UltraMario	and i dont think anything happened
2016-04-05 20:27:20	UltraMario	so
2016-04-05 20:27:57	Yoshi2	nothing happened y e t
2016-04-05 20:28:36	UltraMario	it's been 2 years since the proposal that split the statistics from character pages
2016-04-05 20:28:50	UltraMario	and probably more years that theyve been on the pages respectively
2016-04-05 20:28:51	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-05 20:29:01	Yoshi2	we need another proposal to split the statistics page into subpages
2016-04-05 20:29:08	UltraMario	kek
2016-04-05 20:29:14	Yoshi2	i am serious
2016-04-05 20:29:17	Yoshi2	that page is a mess
2016-04-05 20:29:19	UltraMario	if you thought mario's statistics page was bad'
2016-04-05 20:29:27	UltraMario	just look at what it was like
2016-04-05 20:29:29	UltraMario	before the split
2016-04-05 20:29:30	UltraMario	;)
2016-04-05 20:29:40	UltraMario	things took ages to load
2016-04-05 20:30:01	UltraMario	that's the reason the split was there in the first place

2016-04-06 00:01:58	@PikFan	hey, was there ever an actual secret behind the Plasm Wraith you found?
2016-04-06 00:03:02	ScruffyChat	Yes, I'm planning to release that later
2016-04-06 00:03:17	ScruffyChat	Although I suppose it's not that much of a secret
2016-04-06 00:03:29	@PikFan	ah

2016-04-06 00:08:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I had to scramble to come up with a good April Fool's joke for Pikipedia
2016-04-06 00:08:16	ScruffyChat	The day before
2016-04-06 00:08:22	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-06 00:08:30	@PikFan	well, I enjoyed it, as you know
2016-04-06 00:08:34	ScruffyChat	And I got this and it's good, but you can see the joke coming a mile away
2016-04-06 00:08:36	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2016-04-06 00:22:25	@PikFan	hey, ScruffyChat
2016-04-06 00:23:00	ScruffyChat	Hey
2016-04-06 00:23:19	@PikFan	so, in my story, there will be a pretty large invasion force taking over the Pikmin Republic's capital
2016-04-06 00:23:38	@PikFan	how large should that invasion force be compared to the rest of the enemy army?
2016-04-06 00:25:13	ScruffyChat	Hmmm
2016-04-06 00:25:35	ScruffyChat	Who is this invasion force composed of again?
2016-04-06 00:25:46	@PikFan	monsters and such
2016-04-06 00:25:48	ScruffyChat	Is it a particular type of Pikmin?
2016-04-06 00:25:51	@PikFan	intelligent monsters, anyway
2016-04-06 00:26:00	ScruffyChat	Ah, right right
2016-04-06 00:26:22	ScruffyChat	well it depends: do you want the invasion to succeed or fail?
2016-04-06 00:26:28	@PikFan	succeed
2016-04-06 00:27:04	@PikFan	because our protagonists will be fleeing while the enemy forces will lay siege to the capital and capture it
2016-04-06 00:27:10	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-06 00:27:21	ScruffyChat	Then have them be a larger army than ever before
2016-04-06 00:27:26	ScruffyChat	Like
2016-04-06 00:27:35	@PikFan	so... an all out attack?
2016-04-06 00:27:38	ScruffyChat	The entire mass of enemies in Pikmin 3, charging at once
2016-04-06 00:27:54	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-04-06 00:27:59	@PikFan	well, you see
2016-04-06 00:28:19	@PikFan	I envision the capital city on a scale like New York City
2016-04-06 00:28:28	@PikFan	just shrunk, of course
2016-04-06 00:29:15	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-04-06 00:31:21	ScruffyChat	Have the Quaggled Mireclops terrorize it
2016-04-06 00:31:35	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-06 00:31:48	@PikFan	well, Pikmin could probably easily overcome it
2016-04-06 00:32:05	@PikFan	I mean, there'd be thousands of fighting Pikmin
2016-04-06 00:32:10	@PikFan	maybe millions
2016-04-06 00:32:17	ScruffyChat	Hmm, true
2016-04-06 00:32:31	ScruffyChat	Then have an army of Waterwraiths?
2016-04-06 00:32:41	ScruffyChat	Or do they hold a different role in the plot/
2016-04-06 00:36:38	@PikFan	ooh, Waterwraiths
2016-04-06 00:36:49	@PikFan	they could patrol the streets after the battle
2016-04-06 00:36:59	@PikFan	literally crush all opposition
2016-04-06 00:38:47	@PikFan	something to this effect http://pasteboard.co/2OhK11gn.png
2016-04-06 00:39:41	@PikFan	but what I want to know is, how much larger should the rest of the army be
2016-04-06 00:39:42	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-04-06 00:39:47	@PikFan	10 times? 20? 100?
2016-04-06 00:40:00	ScruffyChat	Well you've got the whole biomass of PNF-404 you could turn against Pikmin
2016-04-06 00:40:04	ScruffyChat	...for... some reason
2016-04-06 00:40:17	@PikFan	lol
2016-04-06 00:40:26	@PikFan	that...probably wouldn't work
2016-04-06 00:40:33	@PikFan	though it'd be awesome
2016-04-06 00:40:40	@PikFan	(maybe not for the Pikmin though)\
2016-04-06 00:40:49	@PikFan	...random backslash lol
2016-04-06 00:41:13	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2016-04-06 00:41:23	UltraMario	BACKSLASH!
2016-04-06 00:41:25	UltraMario	AIR SLASH
2016-04-06 00:41:34	ScruffyChat	Haha
2016-04-06 00:41:44	ScruffyChat	I always hear "Backscratch!"
2016-04-06 00:45:07	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-06 00:45:31	@PikFan	also, prior to the main invasion, should there be skirmishes and the like throughout the Republic?
2016-04-06 00:45:48	@PikFan	case in point: the attack on the Red, Rock, and Winged Onions
2016-04-06 00:46:28	ScruffyChat	Of course, to build tension
2016-04-06 00:46:43	@PikFan	ah, okay
2016-04-06 00:47:00	@PikFan	oh, and I could say that there's been more fighting along the border
2016-04-06 00:47:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-06 00:47:34	ScruffyChat	Oh man, are there going to be Pikmin political factions?
2016-04-06 00:47:47	@PikFan	I dunno, huge conquests like these just...fascinate me 
2016-04-06 00:47:50	@PikFan	yes, actually
2016-04-06 00:47:54	@PikFan	but it'll be simple
2016-04-06 00:48:02	@PikFan	pro-government and anti-government
2016-04-06 00:48:56	@PikFan	the anti-government people are dissatisfied because they think the government isn't doing enough to protect their Republic
2016-04-06 00:49:22	@PikFan	so in addition to the looming threat of the enemy nation, you've also got internal instability
2016-04-06 00:50:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-06 00:57:11	ScruffyChat	That sounds very tense
2016-04-06 00:57:20	@PikFan	huh
2016-04-06 00:57:29	ScruffyChat	Even more so that the main characters are just going to leave it being taken over
2016-04-06 00:57:30	ScruffyChat	To visit the other world
2016-04-06 00:57:39	@PikFan	so that image I showed you had 50 airships from the west
2016-04-06 00:57:52	@PikFan	then it seems that there are 300 airships coming from the north
2016-04-06 00:58:00	@PikFan	and 300 more from the south, too
2016-04-06 00:58:09	@PikFan	and then a huge invasion fleet from the east
2016-04-06 00:58:38	ScruffyChat	That's a lot of airship levels
2016-04-06 00:58:54	@PikFan	hm
2016-04-06 00:59:18	@PikFan	perhaps my invasion force should be a considerable portion of the entire enemy army
2016-04-06 01:01:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-06 01:01:16	ScruffyChat	Maybe they're bluffing about their true size
2016-04-06 01:01:20	ScruffyChat	Animals do it all the time
2016-04-06 01:01:40	ScruffyChat	Frogs, those weird birds
2016-04-06 01:01:47	ScruffyChat	Blowfish...
2016-04-06 01:02:52	@PikFan	good point
2016-04-06 01:45:53	@PikFan	sorry, gotta go

2016-04-06 16:39:20	Neocraftz1553	it was a paper ish package, and you can't really read it once its soaked and burnt
2016-04-06 16:39:37	Neocraftz1553	I CAN tell you this...
2016-04-06 16:40:01	Neocraftz1553	It was some kind of Dark chocolate...
2016-04-06 16:40:25	Yoshi2	why would it be soaked and burnt
2016-04-06 16:40:36	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-06 16:40:43	Neocraftz1553	Stovetop and sink...
2016-04-06 16:41:11	Yoshi2	isn't the modus of operation that you empty the content of the bag and put it away
2016-04-06 16:41:23	Yoshi2	maybe it could become soaked, but why burnt

2016-04-06 19:35:19	Marty2000	Hi Espyo.
2016-04-06 19:36:23	@Espyo	hey
2016-04-06 19:49:04	Marty2000	I have a question. You know, I said Purple Pikmin might be immune to ink. And recently, I managed to get a Purple Pikmin attack a Spluttefish (and latch on to it) Of course, my Pikmin didn't get inke. I don't know exactly how those mechanics work, but if I remember well, you have access to Pikmin 3's files. I wondered if there was anything that could prove 
2016-04-06 19:49:22	Marty2000	they are immune to ink inside the game's files. Thanks.
2016-04-06 19:50:50	Yoshi2	if we are lucky, the immunity is in a file that can be edited easily
2016-04-06 19:51:04	Yoshi2	if we are unlucky, it's hardcoded into the executable
2016-04-06 19:51:42	Marty2000	Ok, thanks Yoshi2.
2016-04-06 19:52:37	@Espyo	it's very likely hardcoded
2016-04-06 19:52:47	@Espyo	at least I don't immediately recall
2016-04-06 19:52:57	@Espyo	numeric parameters, like speed, carrying strength, etc. are one thing
2016-04-06 19:53:02	@Espyo	but hazards aren't really a "defined" thing
2016-04-06 19:53:19	@Espyo	like, if Purples can resist being knocked down from Puffy Blowhogs
2016-04-06 19:53:26	@Espyo	chances are they didn't make that a hazard just to say Purples are immune to it
2016-04-06 19:53:33	@Espyo	plus the game has no idea what "immune" means to wind
2016-04-06 19:54:03	@Espyo	for fire and water, it means not getting their stem on fire or wet, and running in a panic
2016-04-06 19:54:06	@Espyo	but wind?
2016-04-06 19:54:10	@Espyo	so a lot of it is probably very code-based
2016-04-06 19:54:27	Marty2000	Ok, thanks :-)
2016-04-06 19:54:40	@Espyo	I'll check when I can though
2016-04-06 19:54:48	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1459968761-purples.png
2016-04-06 19:56:38	@Espyo	neat
2016-04-06 19:56:40	Marty2000	The same thing was done with Whites, and they were inked. But I don't see why Purples would resist ink. At first, Nvortex and I thought their ground pound was the reason for this "immunity" because I used to throw Pikmin directly into the water, but now... 
2016-04-06 19:57:14	Marty2000	Maybe their color has something to do with that
2016-04-06 19:58:14	Marty2000	I'll just strop trying for now, it's too time-consuming to look for a proof until we have hacks.

2016-04-07 01:53:55	Neocraftz1553	and then I saw the bomb rocks health go down midair and when I realized, it was too late
2016-04-07 01:53:55	Neocraftz1553	btw, I almost shat when I saw it
2016-04-07 01:53:55	Neocraftz1553	it floated outta nowhere and looked like a spider

2016-04-07 16:45:17	@PikFan	so many people I know like Sanders
2016-04-07 16:46:00	Neocraftz1553	Is it ok to categorize the Armored Mawdad under "Mawdads"?
2016-04-07 16:46:04	@PikFan	yeah
2016-04-07 16:46:11	Neocraftz1553	cause it has no known family and stuff
2016-04-07 16:46:15	Neocraftz1553	and it is canon
2016-04-07 16:47:19	@PikFan	in this particular election, though, there seems to be more...passion
2016-04-07 16:47:59	@PikFan	people seem to be more passionate about who they're supporting
2016-04-07 16:48:45	Chiaki_Nanami	I haven't seen that same level of passion from Clinton supporters
2016-04-07 16:48:55	Chiaki_Nanami	in either case, it's because of the internet
2016-04-07 16:49:00	@PikFan	heh, I guess so
2016-04-07 16:49:15	@PikFan	I've seen people say "Hillary for Prison 2016"
2016-04-07 16:49:17	Chiaki_Nanami	the internet is amazingly great at polarising opinions and catalysing them
2016-04-07 16:49:30	Chiaki_Nanami	isn't she under an FBI investigation?
2016-04-07 16:49:41	@PikFan	I think so

2016-04-07 16:49:47	@PikFan	I really ought to look into that
2016-04-07 16:49:57	@PikFan	yeah because the establishment wants her to win
2016-04-07 16:50:05	@PikFan	so they can continue being corrupt

2016-04-07 16:52:09	Chiaki_Nanami	it's like there's a cold war between the US and Mexico
2016-04-07 16:52:12	Chiaki_Nanami	which there isn't
2016-04-07 16:52:23	@PikFan	well, if he does become President, he'd probably find a way
2016-04-07 16:52:31	Chiaki_Nanami	and last time I checked, more Mexicans were leaving the US than entering the country
2016-04-07 16:52:43	@PikFan	how hard can building a wall be...?
2016-04-07 16:52:55	Chiaki_Nanami	if it's a massive wall, pretty hard
2016-04-07 16:53:22	Chiaki_Nanami	did you know there's people that want a wall on the Canadian border too
2016-04-07 16:53:22	@PikFan	"Yeah right!" says the Great Wall of China
2016-04-07 16:53:32	@PikFan	well, that was pretty hard too
2016-04-07 16:53:40	@PikFan	took hundreds of years to build
2016-04-07 16:53:46	@PikFan	but eh, I digress
2016-04-07 16:53:50	@PikFan	and /what/
2016-04-07 16:53:55	Chiaki_Nanami	because if the Mexicans can't get into the US from the southern border, they'll move to Canada and then enter the country from the northern border
2016-04-07 16:53:59	@PikFan	why are people concerned with a northern border

2016-04-07 19:05:57	Marty2000	"*In the ''New Play Control!'' version, grabbing a Pikmin the direction the Captain is facing, then pointing the cursor behind him and throwing allows the player to throw Pikmin backwards." Is it really a glitch? Sure, it's quite strange to throw Pikmin backwards but... I didn't know that it was considered as a glitch
2016-04-07 19:06:07	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think it is
2016-04-07 19:06:18	@Espyo	I can't even quite understand the instructions
2016-04-07 19:10:51	@Espyo	https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/4dny0s/wikia_sites_wreck_firefox/ heh
2016-04-07 19:18:25	Marty2000	But anyway, it's true that throwing Pikmin works different in the NPC! version of the first game. If you hold the Nunchuk stick downwards, for example, you can move the Pikmin without moving Olimar. I don't think that's a glitch but I don't think you can do that in the Gamecube version either
2016-04-07 19:18:40	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-04-07 19:18:54	@Espyo	move the Pikmin without moving Olimar? how so?
2016-04-07 19:20:01	Marty2000	If you hold the Nunchuk stick slightly backwards, Olimar doesn't move, but the Pikmin do (sorry, I don't really know how to explain...)
2016-04-07 19:20:04	Marty2000	Wait
2016-04-07 19:20:28	Marty2000	I'm upoading a video to show that because it's quite hard to explain for me
2016-04-07 19:20:38	@Espyo	hm, okay
2016-04-07 19:22:42	Marty2000	At 0:06 : I'm moving the cursor without moving the Nunchuk stick. At 0:12 , I'm slightly moving both the cursor and the Nunchuk stick
2016-04-07 19:22:45	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFhAAgbukCg&feature=youtu.be
2016-04-07 19:23:19	@Espyo	oh, I see what you mean!
2016-04-07 19:23:21	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-07 19:23:27	@Espyo	this can probably be added to [[Throw]]

2016-04-07 19:23:48	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-07 19:24:00	@Espyo	at the start, are you doing that "glitch" that was added recently?
2016-04-07 19:24:08	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-07 19:24:16	Marty2000	I'm throwing Pikmin backwards
2016-04-07 19:24:33	@Espyo	right
2016-04-07 19:24:33	Marty2000	But as you can see, that's not really a glitch... or at least that's what I think
2016-04-07 19:24:38	@Espyo	agreed
2016-04-07 19:24:53	@Espyo	wanna remove it from the wiki?
2016-04-07 19:25:47	Marty2000	If it's not a glitch, then I think it's not necessary
2016-04-07 19:25:55	Marty2000	to leave it
2016-04-07 19:27:11	Marty2000	I'll edit the "Throw" article and if necessary, I'll edit the Glitches section as well.

2016-04-07 19:41:26	@Espyo	all right
2016-04-07 19:41:33	@Espyo	should be easy
2016-04-07 19:41:37	@Espyo	get two leaf Pikmin
2016-04-07 19:41:39	@Espyo	spray one of them
2016-04-07 19:41:42	@Espyo	(maybe let the spray run out)
2016-04-07 19:41:46	@Espyo	move about so that the leaf is closest to you
2016-04-07 19:41:48	@Espyo	and try throwing
2016-04-07 19:41:55	@Espyo	if the flower goes to you instead, confirmed
2016-04-07 19:42:06	@Espyo	may want to repeat that like 5 or 6 times to make sure it's not actually random
2016-04-07 19:42:11	Marty2000	I thought it was only true for the first two games
2016-04-07 19:42:21	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-07 19:42:29	@Espyo	no, in the first two games, it's whatever is closest
2016-04-07 19:43:14	Marty2000	In the first two games, when holding a Pikmin, they organize in groups, don't they?

2016-04-07 19:44:16	@Espyo	they do
2016-04-07 19:44:21	@Espyo	but it's still technically the closest
2016-04-07 19:44:37	@Espyo	in P3, I think it's always all flowers first, all buds second, all leafs third, regardless of where those Pikmin are in the group

2016-04-07 19:51:50	Marty2000	the closest Pikmin is thrown
2016-04-07 19:52:01	Marty2000	It does not depend on their maturity
2016-04-07 19:52:51	@Espyo	yeah, clearly

2016-04-07 19:53:00	@Espyo	see, this is why it's important to verify
2016-04-07 19:53:07	@Espyo	worse than having missing info on a wiki is having WRONG info

2016-04-07 19:56:30	Marty2000	Well it's okay. Usually flowered Pikmin are just behind the leader since they are faster
2016-04-07 19:56:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-07 19:56:55	@Espyo	but I still find that weird... I don't just add stuff like that without being at least a tiny bit sure of what I'm doing

2016-04-07 21:16:55	Yoshi2	Neo: if anything, it should be something like "magnum centipeda" and "aqua centipeda"

2016-04-07 21:18:26	@Espyo	others... not so much
2016-04-07 21:18:29	Neo	just add some wierd suffix/prefix

2016-04-07 21:19:48	Neo	ok, I guess I could go with dog latin right now
2016-04-07 21:19:57	Neo	Means Big Centipede
2016-04-07 21:20:04	Scruffy	I guess so, but Magnum wouldn't be the genus
2016-04-07 21:20:11	Neo	true
2016-04-07 21:20:12	Scruffy	Centipeda would be, if anything
2016-04-07 21:20:25	Neo	Centipeda Magnum?
2016-04-07 21:20:31	Scruffy	That could work
2016-04-07 21:20:46	Neo	hm..
2016-04-07 21:20:50	Yoshi2	I am not sure if it should be centipeda
2016-04-07 21:20:50	Scruffy	But centipeda is already a genus of daisies
2016-04-07 21:21:00	Marty2000	Magnum is either an adverb or the accusative form of "magnus", no...?
2016-04-07 21:21:05	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-07 21:21:06	Neo	oh, good greif...
2016-04-07 21:21:27	Neo	so if I use Centipeda Magnum...
2016-04-07 21:21:46	Neo	I would be categorizing a centipede with daisies...
2016-04-07 21:21:47	Scruffy	Scoloparmatae magnum
2016-04-07 21:23:37	Neo	I guess so...
2016-04-07 21:24:11	Marty2000	For Centipede, as Scruffy said, you could use Scolopendra...

2016-04-07 21:43:43	Yoshi2	I still think it's wrong to glue the words together like that

2016-04-07 21:44:09	Scruffy	It probably is

2016-04-07 21:50:28	Yoshi2	I mean what the correct translation to latin would be

2016-04-07 22:04:33	Scruffy	For each of them
2016-04-07 22:04:40	Neocraftz1553	color white?
2016-04-07 22:04:51	Scruffy	No, both blue
2016-04-07 22:04:57	Scruffy	the same blue
2016-04-07 22:05:02	Scruffy	kind of cerulean
2016-04-07 22:05:02	Neocraftz1553	on emmission?
2016-04-07 22:05:05	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-04-07 22:05:06	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-07 22:05:22	Neocraftz1553	trying to do it for Black Pikmins Yellow flower
2016-04-07 22:05:36	Scruffy	And then Olimar's beacon is a sphere emitting red light at 5.00 brightness
2016-04-07 22:05:48	Scruffy	with a point light right behind it at 2500 red 
2016-04-07 22:06:00	Scruffy	Because otherwise the shadows got really noisy
2016-04-07 22:06:01	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-07 22:06:23	Neocraftz1553	yeah, lighting is hard to do for darker enviroments...
2016-04-07 22:06:37	Neocraftz1553	I mean, you can't really see anything, but...
2016-04-07 22:06:40	Neocraftz1553	you can...

2016-04-07 22:06:46	Marty2000	Did you know that Winged Pikmin had 2 different animations (running or flying) for when they burn up or drown? Example : http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1460063095-montage-winged-fire.png
2016-04-07 22:06:53	Marty2000	I only thought they were flying when burning...
2016-04-07 22:07:04	Neocraftz1553	woah
2016-04-07 22:07:41	Marty2000	The animation depends on the player's actions
2016-04-07 22:08:35	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-07 22:08:41	Marty2000	For example, if you throw a Winged Pikmin to a Fiery Blowhog and then it is burnt up, it will : run if it touched the ground before attacking (throw for example) 
2016-04-07 22:08:43	Neocraftz1553	holding it?
2016-04-07 22:08:53	Neocraftz1553	wow!
2016-04-07 22:08:53	Marty2000	-fly if it didn't touch the ground
2016-04-07 22:09:08	Neocraftz1553	You have to get a screnshot or something!
2016-04-07 22:09:15	Neocraftz1553	It would look so good
2016-04-07 22:09:22	Marty2000	I posted a screenshot of both animations
2016-04-07 22:09:26	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1460063095-montage-winged-fire.png
2016-04-07 22:09:32	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok, let me check..
2016-04-07 22:10:01	Marty2000	And this is a walking drowning Pikmin : http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1460063375-winged-drowning.png
2016-04-07 22:10:01	Scruffy	Wow, that's interesting
2016-04-07 22:10:06	Neocraftz1553	pasteboard please...

2016-04-07 22:10:48	Marty2000	Is that better?
2016-04-07 22:10:59	Neocraftz1553	Thanks much!

2016-04-07 22:11:21	Marty2000	http://pasteboard.co/17hBgsv.png
2016-04-07 22:11:50	Marty2000	I think it might work for the "ink" but unfortunately, you'd need a Toady Bloyster for their "walking animation"...
2016-04-07 22:11:52	Neocraftz1553	Wow, that is veeeerry interesting
2016-04-07 22:12:00	Marty2000	The Sputtlefishes are above water :/
2016-04-07 22:12:10	Neocraftz1553	but....
2016-04-07 22:12:23	Neocraftz1553	they poison underwater, don't they?
2016-04-07 22:13:03	Marty2000	They poison underwater, but they drown at the same moment (so they can't walk)
2016-04-07 22:13:13	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-07 22:13:40	Neocraftz1553	Interesting how Nintendo made almost all instances of Ink underwater...
2016-04-07 22:13:49	Neocraftz1553	then again...
2016-04-07 22:14:21	Neocraftz1553	and they made Phosbat Powder only appear as Phosbat Powder...
2016-04-07 22:14:45	Neocraftz1553	I mean, is Phosbat Powder even the official name?
2016-04-07 22:15:21	Marty2000	But they still get inked underwater

2016-04-07 22:16:06	Neocraftz1553	yeah!

2016-04-07 22:16:27	Neocraftz1553	those eyes don't look like whites eyes...
2016-04-07 22:16:41	Marty2000	Yes, but the same applies for Winged Pikmin
2016-04-07 22:16:51	Neocraftz1553	maybe because any other pikmin besides blues weren't meant to fight Ink
2016-04-07 22:16:52	Marty2000	They lose their compound eyes
2016-04-07 22:17:14	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-04-07 22:17:23	Neocraftz1553	Do they still fly?
2016-04-07 22:17:35	Marty2000	Winged Pikmin fly
2016-04-07 22:18:06	Marty2000	But I think they can walk (if I reproduced the same thing as I did for the fire)

2016-04-08 14:58:36	Neocraftz1553	I just woke up from the wierdest nightmare...
2016-04-08 14:58:56	Marty2000	Ah, sorry :/
2016-04-08 14:59:21	Neocraftz1553	I was stck in a house with vampires and vampire teddy bears :\
2016-04-08 14:59:45	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, now I am here
2016-04-08 15:00:21	Marty2000	http://images.spiraldirect.com/1/1441292544_1347.jpg
2016-04-08 15:01:24	Neocraftz1553	kinda like that except brown
2016-04-08 15:01:35	Neocraftz1553	And their weakness was...
2016-04-08 15:01:44	Neocraftz1553	a bag of marshmallows
2016-04-08 15:02:00	Neocraftz1553	Wierd AF
2016-04-08 15:02:30	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-04-08 15:03:19	Neocraftz1553	It was like a lucid nightmare, it seemed real, but...
2016-04-08 15:03:30	Neocraftz1553	I was like, wait a minute...
2016-04-08 15:03:45	Neocraftz1553	I'm running out of marshmallows...
2016-04-08 15:04:03	Marty2000	Too bad it didn't turn into a lucid dream :/
2016-04-08 15:04:14	Neocraftz1553	and by the time I escaped I was waking up...
2016-04-08 15:04:43	Neocraftz1553	Probably played too much FNAF again...
2016-04-08 15:07:33	Neocraftz1553	now that I think about it, where did the escape carriage come from...
2016-04-08 15:09:55	Yoshi2	I don't have many "classic" nightmares (monsters and stuff) anymore :s
2016-04-08 15:10:06	Yoshi2	vampires and vampire teddy bears sounds cool
2016-04-08 15:10:31	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-08 15:10:54	Neocraftz1553	I'm telling you, they were 8 feet tall!
2016-04-08 15:11:35	Neocraftz1553	But I'm not sure what made me dream it 
2016-04-08 15:11:41	Yoshi2	last nightmare I had was something illogical and caused me to slightly panic until I drowned that out with music and videos
2016-04-08 15:12:36	Yoshi2	wasn't particulary nice
2016-04-08 15:13:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I don't have many nightmares, but....
2016-04-08 15:13:33	Neocraftz1553	when I do, I panic when I am slightly awake...
2016-04-08 15:14:06	Neocraftz1553	Come on... Teddy Bears and Dolls are horrifying 
2016-04-08 15:14:47	Yoshi2	teddy bears are cool
2016-04-08 15:14:59	Neocraftz1553	and it depends on the kind of music I hear after I wake up...
2016-04-08 15:15:06	Yoshi2	dolls are fugly though
2016-04-08 15:15:23	Neocraftz1553	If its music box jingle, I get paranoid...
2016-04-08 15:16:11	Neocraftz1553	today, I am going to be paranoid an 8 foot bear is going to jump out at me...
2016-04-08 15:18:21	Neocraftz1553	but, wtf, why would I have a dream like that?
2016-04-08 15:19:16	Neocraftz1553	because I'm frightened by animatronics...
2016-04-08 15:23:34	Yoshi2	stop playing so much five nights at freddys
2016-04-08 15:25:24	Neocraftz1553	Well, too bad! I have a permanent fear of animatronics...
2016-04-08 15:26:55	Neocraftz1553	I probably have a pretty irrational fear
2016-04-08 15:28:30	Neocraftz1553	oh, and I just need night 5, by the way
2016-04-08 15:28:48	Neocraftz1553	and night 6 & 7

2016-04-08 17:20:35	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy!
2016-04-08 17:21:00	Scruffy	All the photos you're contributing are really great
2016-04-08 17:21:26	Scruffy	I wanted to ask how you record Pikmin 3 videos
2016-04-08 17:21:58	Marty2000	Thanks. I use an Avermedia Game Capture Portable to record videos
2016-04-08 17:22:13	Marty2000	(and for the photos too)
2016-04-08 17:22:24	Scruffy	Ah. Neat!
2016-04-08 17:23:42	Marty2000	The Avermedia isn't so expensive and it's very simple to use, that's why I chose it. I wanted an Elgato at first but it seems more complicated to set up...
2016-04-08 17:23:58	Scruffy	yeah
2016-04-08 17:24:18	Scruffy	I'll have to look into it...
2016-04-08 17:24:22	Scruffy	Oh, one thing
2016-04-08 17:24:35	Scruffy	You uploaded this one called "Bones 2.png" http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Bones_2.png
2016-04-08 17:24:43	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-08 17:24:57	Scruffy	But I don't think those are bones; I always thought they were tubing
2016-04-08 17:25:13	Scruffy	Like exposed rubber hose suctions
2016-04-08 17:25:16	Scruffy	sections*
2016-04-08 17:25:55	Scruffy	The texture name for them contains the word "hose"
2016-04-08 17:26:06	Marty2000	Oh, maybe. I thought those were bones but now that I think of it, it doesn't make much sense...
2016-04-08 17:26:23	Marty2000	Thank you for telling me. I'll change that afterwards
2016-04-08 17:26:33	Scruffy	No problem!

2016-04-08 19:57:28	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Counter_P3.png where did you get this image from?
2016-04-08 19:57:32	@Espyo	did you take the screenshot yourself?
2016-04-08 19:57:41	Marty2000	Yes I did
2016-04-08 19:57:44	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-08 19:57:45	@Espyo	see
2016-04-08 19:58:00	@Espyo	it's because it looks almost exactly like this screenshot I took for the HUD article some months back http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:HUD_Pikmin_counter_P3.jpg
2016-04-08 19:58:01	Marty2000	Well, I think i did
2016-04-08 19:58:41	Marty2000	Ah, it must be your screenshot 
2016-04-08 19:59:05	Marty2000	Sometimes, for comparisons, I use screenshots already uploaded
2016-04-08 19:59:14	Marty2000	And I probably didn't pay attention
2016-04-08 19:59:32	Marty2000	So I think I re-uploaded it 
2016-04-08 19:59:39	Marty2000	Thinking it was my screenshot
2016-04-08 19:59:45	Marty2000	Sorry for that
2016-04-08 20:00:45	Marty2000	I think it should be deleted
2016-04-08 20:01:07	Marty2000	My upload is a duplication

2016-04-08 20:01:27	@Espyo	yeah, it's a duplicate, I'll delete it
2016-04-08 20:01:58	@Espyo	also, two notes for when you upload images
2016-04-08 20:02:19	@Espyo	unless it's important to preserve detail, you should save the images as JPGs
2016-04-08 20:02:19	@Espyo	PNGs are good at keeping perfect detail, but are bigger
2016-04-08 20:02:27	Marty2000	Ah, okay
2016-04-08 20:02:30	@Espyo	especially if the image changes a lot in terms of colors
2016-04-08 20:02:41	@Espyo	we normally don't need pixel-perfect stuff, especially in screenshots, so JPG is the way to go
2016-04-08 20:02:50	@Espyo	secondly, try not to keep black or white borders on the sides
2016-04-08 20:02:54	Marty2000	Ok, I'll remember
2016-04-08 20:03:00	@Espyo	thanks
2016-04-08 20:03:47	Marty2000	By the way, i see you have to edit my uploads to add "categories" : it seems I can't add them when I upload an image. Is it normal?
2016-04-08 20:04:55	UltraMario	yes
2016-04-08 20:05:15	@Espyo	no
2016-04-08 20:05:16	Marty2000	Ok, thanks.
2016-04-08 20:05:20	@Espyo	you add them on the description

2016-04-08 20:11:30	@Espyo	or we could keep it vague and include other things, but those wouldn't be very interesting
2016-04-08 20:11:50	@Espyo	I think it makes more sense to make it an article focused on human things

2016-04-08 20:12:41	Marty2000	Probably Espyo
2016-04-08 20:12:51	@Espyo	can't quite decide on a name though
2016-04-08 20:12:54	Marty2000	But what do we do of that : http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty/Decoration#Remains_of_creatures
2016-04-08 20:13:09	Neo	woah
2016-04-08 20:13:12	Marty2000	I wanted to rename it Background information some time ago
2016-04-08 20:13:12	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-08 20:13:13	Neo	hmm...
2016-04-08 20:13:14	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-08 20:13:18	@Espyo	|:
2016-04-08 20:13:24	Neo	Remains of the past?
2016-04-08 20:13:54	@Espyo	maybe decoration works after all
2016-04-08 20:14:07	@Espyo	I'd suggest decoration OBJECTS, but that tulip drawing isn't an object
2016-04-08 20:14:32	Neo	gtg
2016-04-08 20:14:36	@Espyo	see ya
2016-04-08 20:14:38	Neo	cyas...
2016-04-08 20:14:39	Marty2000	See you
2016-04-08 20:14:39	Neo	again...
2016-04-08 20:14:42	<--	Neo (Mibbit@206.78.wr.nm) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-04-08 20:15:03	Marty2000	Decoration objects cool be okay, but yes, it wouldn't work with the tulip drawing and other drawings..
2016-04-08 20:15:15	Marty2000	And it wouldn't work with the creatures either
2016-04-08 20:15:27	@Espyo	I guess a skull is an object, though
2016-04-08 20:15:41	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-08 20:15:45	@Espyo	well, it can just stay as "decoration"
2016-04-08 20:15:46	@Espyo	at least for now
2016-04-08 20:15:52	@Espyo	while we still try to understand what to make of the article
2016-04-08 20:16:00	Marty2000	Decoration is fine, i think
2016-04-08 20:16:05	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-08 20:18:07	Marty2000	There is another problem with this article : I have other things to add but I just don't know how to call certain things (like http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1460143065-barres-jaunes-et-noires.png
2016-04-08 20:18:27	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-08 20:18:30	@Espyo	you should add them anyway
2016-04-08 20:18:35	@Espyo	but they look like toll gates to me
2016-04-08 20:20:12	Marty2000	Naming them "Toll gates" is okay? If yes, I'll add them to the project
2016-04-08 20:20:39	@Espyo	sure
2016-04-08 20:20:42	@Espyo	if that's what they are...
2016-04-08 20:20:46	@Espyo	it's hard to tell from the image alone
2016-04-08 20:20:54	@Espyo	where are they?
2016-04-08 20:20:58	@Espyo	I can boot up the game and take a look myself
2016-04-08 20:21:17	Marty2000	The Rustyard
2016-04-08 20:21:55	@Espyo	haven't played there yet
2016-04-08 20:21:59	@Espyo	I need more time to play the DLC maps :(
2016-04-08 20:22:04	Marty2000	In Pikmin 3, these sort of things can only be found in Mission Mode or Bingo Battle... 
2016-04-08 20:22:13	@Espyo	still, I'm looking at images, and I'm pretty confident they're toll booths
2016-04-08 20:22:41	@Espyo	sorry, toll gates
2016-04-08 20:22:57	@Espyo	they're not the booths proper, but they are the bar things that block the way
2016-04-08 20:23:05	@Espyo	most toll gates have bars in that same pattern
2016-04-08 20:23:06	Marty2000	Yes, I see what it is
2016-04-08 20:23:15	@Espyo	plus the round thing on that one on the left looks like the pivot
2016-04-08 20:23:22	Marty2000	But I really don't know its name (even in my language...)
2016-04-08 20:23:31	@Espyo	honestly, I don't know the name in my language either...
2016-04-08 20:23:34	Marty2000	I'm looking for it on the internet
2016-04-08 20:23:34	@Espyo	but I know the name in English
2016-04-08 20:23:50	Marty2000	"toll gates"
2016-04-08 20:24:06	@Espyo	oh, I guess I do know the name in Portuguese, but it's more normally used for highway toll gates
2016-04-08 20:24:15	@Espyo	although I guess that that TOO is also an apt use
2016-04-08 20:24:18	@Espyo	bleh, whatever
2016-04-08 20:24:21	@Espyo	this is dumb lol
2016-04-08 20:24:33	@Espyo	ok, besides toll gates, I honestly can't see them being anything else
2016-04-08 20:24:48	@Espyo	they're bars, with a "caution" color pattern, and one of them has a pivot
2016-04-08 20:24:50	@Espyo	has to be
2016-04-08 20:24:58	Marty2000	Yes, I think they are toll gates
2016-04-08 20:24:59	@Espyo	if somebody else disagrees in the future, they can add their opinion
2016-04-08 20:25:16	@Espyo	I'm really liking the idea of your decoration article, Marty
2016-04-08 20:25:26	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-04-08 20:25:29	@Espyo	before now, I never really thought of the human objects left behind on PNF-404, and in Pikmin 3
2016-04-08 20:25:34	@Espyo	and yet, Mission and Bingo are filled with them
2016-04-08 20:25:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-08 20:25:58	@Espyo	I'm sure other people will appreciate a nice list as wlel
2016-04-08 20:25:59	@Espyo	*well
2016-04-08 20:26:03	Marty2000	Which is quite sad, according t me, because most of the time we don't pay attention to those in Mision mode
2016-04-08 20:26:16	Marty2000	Mission*
2016-04-08 20:26:36	Marty2000	We have limited time so instead you really like the environment...
2016-04-08 20:26:48	Marty2000	You don't stop to look at these things
2016-04-08 20:27:37	Marty2000	Ah, if you are looking for the toll gates, use the KopPad
2016-04-08 20:27:43	Marty2000	You can't see them without it
2016-04-08 20:27:45	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-04-08 20:27:51	@Espyo	right
2016-04-08 20:27:54	@Espyo	I'm not any more, but thanks
2016-04-08 20:28:03	@Espyo	oh, it might make sense to add where these objects can be found, on the article
2016-04-08 20:28:07	@Espyo	maybe not necessarily exact locations
2016-04-08 20:28:09	@Espyo	but just the levels
2016-04-08 20:28:25	Marty2000	I did so if I remember
2016-04-08 20:28:58	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty/Decoration#Unclassified
2016-04-08 20:29:17	Marty2000	Look, the level in which they are found is mentioned
2016-04-08 20:29:21	@Espyo	oh, sorry
2016-04-08 20:29:28	Marty2000	(well, you're right, not for every item)
2016-04-08 20:29:29	@Espyo	I only skimmed through, and I didn't remember reading the locatitons
2016-04-08 20:29:44	Marty2000	Some items have several locations
2016-04-08 20:30:27	Marty2000	While some are unique...
2016-04-08 20:30:27	@Espyo	I guess you can skip items that can be found everywhere
2016-04-08 20:30:43	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-04-08 20:31:31	Marty2000	This one is unique in the game http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Cone.png
2016-04-08 20:31:44	Marty2000	But this one is very common, for example : http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Tyre.png

2016-04-08 21:14:01	@Espyo	oh, when you edit the chyiogami section, there's this sentence that goes something like "it's unique to the cave"

2016-04-08 21:20:29	Neocraftz1553	The fire looks like it is melting the Pikmin's leaf/bud/flower
2016-04-08 21:20:43	Marty2000	I love burning Winged Pikmin that are running
2016-04-08 21:20:51	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-08 21:20:58	Marty2000	I prefer them to flying burning Winged Pikmin
2016-04-08 21:22:25	Neocraftz1553	Wait, how do captains save the Pikmin from burning?
2016-04-08 21:22:33	Marty2000	Whistling

2016-04-08 21:35:55	@Espyo	(ugh I never know how to spell it)
2016-04-08 21:37:25	Marty2000	I wanted to know if my explanation was clear to understand about how to get running WInged Pikmin (like this : http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/3/3f/Montage_drowning_Winged.png
2016-04-08 21:37:41	Neocraftz1553	Their running animation probably happens when they land in shallow water...
2016-04-08 21:37:54	Marty2000	No
2016-04-08 21:38:01	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-08 21:38:04	Marty2000	(about drowning, yes)
2016-04-08 21:38:06	Neocraftz1553	then, maybe...
2016-04-08 21:38:13	Marty2000	But for the water bubble, fire, ink...
2016-04-08 21:38:21	Neocraftz1553	running?
2016-04-08 21:38:27	Marty2000	It happens when they touched the ground before attacking
2016-04-08 21:38:31	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-04-08 21:38:46	Marty2000	(so they must be thrown to the ground)
2016-04-08 21:38:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-04-08 21:39:21	Marty2000	That's really cool the fact they made 2 different animations for Winged Pikmin
2016-04-08 21:41:17	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-08 21:41:27	Neocraftz1553	Its a pretty small detail, but htey put it in
2016-04-08 21:43:15	Neocraftz1553	woah, I did not know I made that many edits in  the last 30 days

2016-04-08 21:43:36	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-08 21:43:53	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, whats a "rollbacker"
2016-04-08 21:44:12	@Espyo	a rollbacker is someone with the ability to perform a rollback
2016-04-08 21:44:25	Neocraftz1553	restoring pages?
2016-04-08 21:44:26	@Espyo	when they're watching a diff, they get a rollback button
2016-04-08 21:44:34	@Espyo	which, upon pressing, instantly undoes the edit
2016-04-08 21:44:39	@Espyo	useful for fighting against spam
2016-04-08 21:44:53	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:ActiveUsers
2016-04-08 21:44:55	@Espyo	all people get an "undo" button when watching a diff
2016-04-08 21:45:06	@Espyo	they can use that to undo as well, but they must go through the edit screen first
2016-04-08 21:45:10	@Espyo	the rollback button skips that
2016-04-08 21:45:23	@Espyo	I think Pikipedia has more info

2016-04-08 21:46:40	@Espyo	anything that has public access and more than 3 months of life got vandalized or spammed at least once
2016-04-08 21:46:43	@Espyo	well, you know, more or less
2016-04-08 21:46:50	Neocraftz1553	^^
2016-04-08 21:46:52	@Espyo	but yeah, every once in a while, there's some vandalism or spam
2016-04-08 21:47:01	@Espyo	actually, spam is pretty rare on Pikipedia, which is surprising
2016-04-08 21:47:05	@Espyo	but vandals sometimes can't resist it
2016-04-08 21:47:16	@Espyo	last vandal was around 5 months ago

2016-04-09 16:26:02	Scruffy	*Then with the hair, there should be options in "Children" if you select "Simple" children
2016-04-09 16:26:23	Scruffy	At the very bottom are options for the kink to the hair, such as curling it or braiding it
2016-04-09 16:26:34	Scruffy	just experiment with those values until you get something you like

2016-04-09 16:28:01	Neocraftz1553	oooh, simple children are children on the tip of the hairs, right?

2016-04-09 17:05:39	Marty2000	Is it also 10 for CT?
2016-04-09 17:05:43	@Espyo	oh, I guess it must've been a typo
2016-04-09 17:05:45	@Espyo	says 10 in the game files

2016-04-09 17:05:57	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-09 17:06:02	@Espyo	the game only has one value, which gets used for both CT and BE
2016-04-09 17:06:12	@Espyo	but I know that at one point, I found one value that doesn't reflect the truth
2016-04-09 17:06:22	@Espyo	and I think it is the Mission value on enemies

2016-04-09 19:46:08	@Espyo	I'm seeing that the theme really is "keep out"

2016-04-09 19:51:26	@Espyo	so it makes sense that those are toll booths
2016-04-09 19:51:30	@Espyo	I'll ask for second opinions
2016-04-09 19:52:30	Marty2000	I'll upload them as "toll booths" and we can still change the name if we find out it's wrong.
2016-04-09 19:53:42	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-09 19:53:49	@Espyo	asked my sister, she raised a good point
2016-04-09 19:53:59	@Espyo	they look like those bars you put on horse tracks to make them jump over them
2016-04-09 19:54:07	Marty2000	Ah
2016-04-09 19:54:08	Marty2000	I see
2016-04-09 19:54:11	@Espyo	but... the theme of the level doesn't really match sports or anything like that
2016-04-09 19:54:14	@Espyo	it's just a construction site
2016-04-09 19:54:15	@Espyo	so it can't be
2016-04-09 19:54:29	@Espyo	the reason that they don't look quite like toll booths is because they have a ring on BOTH sides, not just one

2016-04-09 20:33:22	Scruffy	It's not adjustable, I think it's a ring wrench
2016-04-09 20:33:28	Scruffy	But it's a very fat one
2016-04-09 20:34:33	Marty2000	Thanks

2016-04-09 20:39:36	@Espyo	huh?!
2016-04-09 20:39:44	@Espyo	this Purple Pikmin is carrying something, and the numbers are purple
2016-04-09 20:39:50	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-09 20:39:53	@Espyo	what does that mean?
2016-04-09 20:40:02	Scruffy	Oh yeah, that's adjustable
2016-04-09 20:40:15	Marty2000	It means the carriers are Purple Pikmin in majority
2016-04-09 20:40:24	Scruffy	Wow, that's crazy detail
2016-04-09 20:40:28	@Espyo	but
2016-04-09 20:40:29	Marty2000	But it's still like Pikmin 2 : their destination is random
2016-04-09 20:40:39	@Espyo	oh, it doesn't TELL YOU what the destination is?
2016-04-09 20:40:44	Marty2000	No

2016-04-09 20:42:35	Marty2000	But... you can know if the carrying destination changed (if you added new Purple Pikmin)

2016-04-09 20:42:51	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-09 20:43:08	Marty2000	Before continuing to carry their item, they will freeze for a second

2016-04-09 20:44:03	@Espyo	right, right

2016-04-09 20:49:43	En_Passant	In Collect Treasures in The Rustyard, there are some Rocks hiding behind a metal object near Brittany
2016-04-09 20:49:53	En_Passant	iirc that's also a shovel head
2016-04-09 20:50:14	Marty2000	But it's still annoying since time passes quite fast
2016-04-09 20:50:41	Marty2000	En_Passant : thank you, I'll take a screenshot of it
2016-04-09 20:52:56	En_Passant	At least with my route for BC, there aren't any times where Purples carry enemies where you rely on the outcome
2016-04-09 20:55:35	Marty2000	Is this the shovel head you mentioned, En_Passant? http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1460231712-shovel-3.jpg
2016-04-09 20:56:46	Scruffy	I think that's a sewer head
2016-04-09 20:57:15	Marty2000	Yes, I think it is
2016-04-09 20:57:27	Marty2000	But I hadn't even noticed that item
2016-04-09 20:57:29	@Espyo	that's a good help

2016-04-09 20:57:53	Marty2000	No problem
2016-04-09 20:58:02	En_Passant	Yeah, that
2016-04-09 20:58:41	Marty2000	Well, I think it's a sewer head too, but anyway thanks for finding that item
2016-04-09 20:58:47	En_Passant	I knew it was metal, flat, and broad, but I couldn't remember exactly what
2016-04-09 20:59:53	En_Passant	Another thing to include: empty cans
2016-04-09 21:00:43	En_Passant	Some have bomb rocks in P1, and The Rustyard again has one

2016-04-09 22:03:12	Marty2000	Nvortex : I don't know what other people think but I wouldn't say ink is poison because it doesn't kill Pikmin and it affects White Pikmin. I don't know for the dust because we can't test it with Whites and Purples. Do you remember I said Purples MIGHT be immune to it? Of course, it could be wrong because the testing conditions aren't great, and as you said,
2016-04-09 22:03:47	Marty2000	it could be because of their ground pound. But if later, we can verify this hypothesis for Purples and it's proven they're immune to ink
2016-04-09 22:03:55	Marty2000	Then I'd classify those as "panic"
2016-04-09 22:04:06	Marty2000	(since they're not affected by panic in Pikmin 2)
2016-04-09 22:04:26	En_Passant	Does Pikmin 3 even have panicking?
2016-04-09 22:04:51	Marty2000	Normally, panicking is absent
2016-04-09 22:05:11	Marty2000	But I think ink and dust are a form of panicking (but it's just a theory, of course)
2016-04-09 22:05:11	@PikFan	hmm, I actually like the term "panicking"
2016-04-09 22:05:46	@PikFan	any non-lethal hazard that causes Pikmin to scurry around in a frenzy should be considered panicking
2016-04-09 22:06:03	@PikFan	so Phosbat's dust, ink, and Mitites all cause Pikmin to panic
2016-04-09 22:06:07	Marty2000	Look : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThD1agEgWk&nohtml5=False
2016-04-09 22:06:16	Marty2000	White Pikmin get affected by ink
2016-04-09 22:06:26	Marty2000	But Purples seem to not get affected
2016-04-09 22:06:59	Marty2000	(but it's maybe because I  threw them at the wrong moment)
2016-04-09 22:07:52	@PikFan	...that's disturbing
2016-04-09 22:08:07	@PikFan	the White Pikmin's eyes flashing like that is really disturbing
2016-04-09 22:08:12	@PikFan	oh, hey
2016-04-09 22:08:23	@PikFan	here's an idea for next year's April Fool's
2016-04-09 22:08:32	@PikFan	make a horror movie parody
2016-04-09 22:08:48	@PikFan	featuring strange and disturbing clips throughout the series
2016-04-09 22:08:58	Marty2000	Ha ha, it could be cool
2016-04-09 22:09:52	En_Passant	They looked like they were affected to me
2016-04-09 22:11:04	Marty2000	Did you see them with strange eyes and choking?
2016-04-09 22:11:54	@PikFan	yes, that's what I said was disturbing
2016-04-09 22:12:17	Marty2000	Ah, sorry. I thought En_Passant was talking about Purples
2016-04-09 22:12:55	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-04-09 22:14:14	Scruffy	There was definitely a Purple there who got inked and panicked
2016-04-09 22:14:44	Scruffy	Oh wait never mind, that was the Blue
2016-04-09 22:15:01	Marty2000	If we could just get a screenshot with a Purple having those strange eyes, then it'd be proven
2016-04-09 22:15:32	Scruffy	Yeah

2016-04-10 12:16:04	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2016-04-10 12:16:29	Marty2000	Hello.
2016-04-10 12:16:35	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-10 12:17:36	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-04-10 12:17:37	Testyo	the first 6 months that is removed later?
2016-04-10 12:17:47	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-10 12:18:18	Yoshi2	I'm starting to get the hang out of qt
2016-04-10 12:18:25	Yoshi2	it's actually pretty neat
2016-04-10 12:18:50	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-10 12:18:55	@Espyo	that's normally how it goes
2016-04-10 12:20:03	Yoshi2	I can populate the list widget with entries as I want, I can change a label that is on the side to show info about the currently selected list
2016-04-10 12:20:50	Yoshi2	I can force the list to have a specific item selected
2016-04-10 12:25:07	@Espyo	good
2016-04-10 12:26:02	Yoshi2	now I just need to get some sort of 2d rendering done with draggable items, and I will be a happy person
2016-04-10 12:28:48	@Espyo	how so?
2016-04-10 12:34:44	Yoshi2	because I'm doing an editor for levels from BW where you are looking from the top down onto the playfield
2016-04-10 12:35:01	Yoshi2	and I want to support dragging around elements of the level
2016-04-10 12:36:34	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-10 12:36:38	@Espyo	well, that can't be THAT hard
2016-04-10 12:36:42	@Espyo	there has to be a way
2016-04-10 12:45:16	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/White_Spectralid#Pikmin_3_Prima_Guide   "The White Spectralids[sic]" Is it really a mistake? Because in-game, it's actually White Spectralids http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/14/1460287163-spectralids.png

2016-04-10 12:50:09	@Espyo	but it can only be assumed to be one massive mistake
2016-04-10 12:50:14	@Espyo	because the sentence is just completely idiotic that way
2016-04-10 12:50:27	@Espyo	see also [[Flitterbie family#Naming]]

2016-04-10 13:52:22	Yoshi2	there is always a way, it's just about how difficult it is
2016-04-10 14:14:16	@Espyo	well, yeah
2016-04-10 14:15:52	Yoshi2	apparently I can try to paint directly onto a widget

2016-04-10 16:39:29	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as Chiafki_Nanami
2016-04-10 16:39:44	Nvortex	espyo, when you kill the mireclops they mention the "creature doing a number on it" doesn't that count as the mireclops destroying it?
2016-04-10 16:39:54	Nvortex	also
2016-04-10 16:39:56	Nvortex	"Unlike the Burrowing Snagret and Burrowing Snarrow, the Pileated Snagret lacks the distinguishing "tail feathers"."
2016-04-10 16:40:01	Nvortex	what is this even talking about
2016-04-10 16:40:45	@Espyo	they do?
2016-04-10 16:40:47	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-10 16:40:48	@Espyo	well, sure
2016-04-10 16:40:57	@Espyo	but do we know necessarily WHEN the Mireclops damaged it?
2016-04-10 16:41:16	@Espyo	hm, let me check the context on that Snagret one
2016-04-10 16:41:30	Nvortex	well the most logical explanation is thatit was after the videow as recorded
2016-04-10 16:41:48	@Espyo	yeah, I'd assume so too
2016-04-10 16:42:00	@Espyo	but there must be some way to phrase it as "the Quaggled Mireclops destroyed it, but we don't know exactly when"
2016-04-10 16:42:05	@Espyo	"even if it's likely after the video"
2016-04-10 16:42:56	Nvortex	marty are you playing pikmin 3 right now? if so, could you record the dialogue of each captain after the mireclops is killed?
2016-04-10 16:43:31	Nvortex	by the way, mireclops's is wrong mireclops' is correct
2016-04-10 16:43:43	@Espyo	yeah, I don't know what the hell the Burrowing Snagret thing means
2016-04-10 16:43:45	@Espyo	can you delete it?
2016-04-10 16:43:57	Nvortex	yeah
2016-04-10 16:44:00	@Espyo	and I remember checking on the rules for the apostrophe-s before
2016-04-10 16:44:06	@Espyo	and I think it's mireclops's
2016-04-10 16:44:08	@Espyo	OR
2016-04-10 16:44:12	@Espyo	it changes in the UK and US
2016-04-10 16:44:15	@Espyo	...which is a massive pain
2016-04-10 16:44:26	@Espyo	if you can confirm what is the exact proper way in the US, please fix it accordingly
2016-04-10 16:44:31	@Espyo	if not, if nobody can decide on a standard
2016-04-10 16:44:38	@Espyo	then screw it, leave it as it is, and save yourself the effort
2016-04-10 16:44:47	@Espyo	since no way is wrong, might as well not fix what's not wrong
2016-04-10 16:44:56	Nvortex	now i don't know if  " s' "  is for plural and/or for words ending in s
2016-04-10 16:45:06	@Espyo	yeah, that's the problem
2016-04-10 16:45:14	@Espyo	I think the rule I learned after researching is:
2016-04-10 16:45:21	@Espyo	if it's plural, end with just an apostrophe
2016-04-10 16:45:26	@Espyo	if it's a proper noun ending in s, end with apostrophe-s

2016-04-10 16:45:57	Marty2000	If the plural ends by an s', then it's "s'"

2016-04-10 16:46:41	@Espyo	stupid English
2016-04-10 16:46:52	Nvortex	but most people use s's so...i guess its correct
2016-04-10 16:46:56	Marty2000	But for exemple, "children" is plural
2016-04-10 16:47:07	Marty2000	But you say "children's"
2016-04-10 16:47:21	Nvortex	also i wrote "i guess its correct" should it have been "i guess it's correct"
2016-04-10 16:47:32	Nvortex	?

2016-04-10 18:04:33	ScruffyChat	Just a few things
2016-04-10 18:04:44	ScruffyChat	I might end up changing the interface design a little bit from that
2016-04-10 18:04:58	Neocraftz1553	Ok
2016-04-10 18:05:13	Neocraftz1553	do you have Inkscape?

2016-04-10 18:05:52	ScruffyChat	I don't have Inkscape, but I can use Blender to do it, if you can send me the image without the interface, it's a well-made image

2016-04-10 18:22:34	ScruffyChat	Oh, Espyo, I think I have an explanation for the bomb rocks' energy looking bloated when viewed from afar through the camera
2016-04-10 18:23:01	ScruffyChat	It has to do with the camera's depth of field function, which turns distant objects blurry if close objects are in autofocus
2016-04-10 18:23:23	ScruffyChat	Normally bomb rocks are spheres that are easy to blur and calculate distance

2016-04-10 18:23:58	ScruffyChat	So I think it miscalculates their blur

2016-04-11 12:42:13	Marty2000	He he... I found a glitch that could potentially break Pikmin 3... it allows the player to bring Red Pikmin in water
2016-04-11 12:54:05	Yoshi2	nice
2016-04-11 12:54:13	Yoshi2	Marty2000: how do you do the glitch?
2016-04-11 12:54:24	Marty2000	I'm uploading a video
2016-04-11 12:54:54	Marty2000	But basically, you need the uncontrollable Pikmin glitch
2016-04-11 12:55:01	Marty2000	I have a video about that
2016-04-11 12:55:01	Marty2000	Waity
2016-04-11 12:55:04	Marty2000	Wait*
2016-04-11 12:55:54	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGa3UdAvtU4
2016-04-11 12:56:19	Marty2000	I could reproduce this glitch in Story Mode and since this glitch makes Pikmin invincible, Red Pikmin can go in water
2016-04-11 12:56:34	Marty2000	They can probably take down electric gates too
2016-04-11 12:58:05	Marty2000	The video will be here in about 25 minutes
2016-04-11 13:15:36	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/Nebg_r6G3Yk
2016-04-11 13:16:35	Marty2000	Sorry for the bad quality, I'll probably re-upload it in 720p later
2016-04-11 14:23:18	Yoshi2	Marty2000: the only issue I have with that video is that it has a thick black border at the top and bottom
2016-04-11 14:23:40	Yoshi2	and the compression artifacts
2016-04-11 14:25:38	Yoshi2	with the leader icons in the lower left corner
2016-04-11 14:36:58	Marty2000	I'm going to re-upload it anyway
2016-04-11 14:37:06	Marty2000	(in better quality)
2016-04-11 14:38:17	Marty2000	It'll take some time though
2016-04-11 14:38:26	Marty2000	Could you still see the glitch?
2016-04-11 14:40:58	Marty2000	The video will be uploaded in less than two hours.
2016-04-11 14:44:05	Yoshi2	I haven't watched all of the video yet, will do it later

2016-04-11 18:57:04	Neocraftz1553	bomc rock, in my opinion...
2016-04-11 18:57:19	Neocraftz1553	*bomb rock
2016-04-11 18:57:51	Marty2000	It looks great in black, very beautiful

2016-04-11 18:58:25	Marty2000	Seeing a black version is cool
2016-04-11 18:59:53	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I tried to make it cloaked in shadow
2016-04-11 19:03:38	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, wheres Testyo?

2016-04-11 19:20:24	@Espyo	get up on that weird ledge near the landing site

2016-04-11 19:22:11	Marty2000	That Wollywog glitch is great, it allows a 7-day run on the Wii version

2016-04-11 19:29:21	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, is there an article explaining why the wikia split happened?
2016-04-11 19:29:29	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-11 19:29:37	@Espyo	best you've got is [[Pikipedia:About]]
2016-04-11 19:29:37	Testyo	"Pikipedia:About" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:About
2016-04-11 19:30:06	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-11 19:30:49	Marty2000	By the way, why is there still people on Pikmin Wikia whereas the split happened? Didn't some people want the merge to happen?
2016-04-11 19:31:19	Marty2000	why are there people?*
2016-04-11 19:31:33	UltraMario	because
2016-04-11 19:31:36	UltraMario	people are dumb
2016-04-11 19:31:36	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-11 19:31:47	Neocraftz1553	They decided to stay
2016-04-11 19:32:02	@Espyo	biggest reason is they're misinformed
2016-04-11 19:32:08	@Espyo	they don't know that a move happened
2016-04-11 19:32:15	@Espyo	because wikia is on the top of search results almost all the time
2016-04-11 19:32:31	@Espyo	of course, there are one or two guys that stay on wikia because they have adminship there
2016-04-11 19:32:32	Marty2000	Ah
2016-04-11 19:32:34	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-11 19:32:41	@Espyo	they'd rather be admins of a cesspool than join the rest of the community
2016-04-11 19:32:42	@Espyo	some people...
2016-04-11 19:33:05	Neocraftz1553	yeah, the above...
2016-04-11 19:33:27	Neocraftz1553	I used to be part of Pikcanon-NOT and Pikmin wikia
2016-04-11 19:33:49	@Espyo	we DID try to warn people that everybody moved and there's a better place, several times
2016-04-11 19:34:05	Neocraftz1553	but they stayed
2016-04-11 19:34:06	@Espyo	but of course, wikia only cares about protecting their own user counter
2016-04-11 19:34:14	@Espyo	so they ordered staff members to take down our notifications
2016-04-11 19:34:20	Neocraftz1553	oh..
2016-04-11 19:34:29	Neocraftz1553	no womnder...
2016-04-11 19:34:57	@Espyo	so yeah, between people not knowing that there's a move, some disgusting people preferring power over community, and wikia being too stubborn to let us be
2016-04-11 19:35:00	@Espyo	it's a bit hard to get people to come
2016-04-11 19:35:06	@Espyo	but we've got other things on our side, like reddit
2016-04-11 19:35:21	@Espyo	the plan is to use Pikmin 4 as a way to bring everybody else onto Pikipedia
2016-04-11 19:35:42	Neocraftz1553	yeah!

2016-04-11 20:01:48	Neocraftz1553	we have lots articles with tons of quality...
2016-04-11 20:02:14	Neocraftz1553	Its better to have one good quality article than millions of one-word articles.
2016-04-11 20:03:27	Neocraftz1553	like choosing between a good computer and many windows '95s
2016-04-11 20:03:39	Neocraftz1553	but, thats just me...
2016-04-11 20:10:53	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/f0/Montage_Winged_fire.png Do you remember the Winged Pikmin's running animation? I tried to have them run in the Tropical Wilds, and they can't fall in water : they will "run" over the water. That's strange
2016-04-11 20:11:06	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-11 20:12:06	Neocraftz1553	Is the water there shallow?
2016-04-11 20:12:35	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-11 20:12:53	Marty2000	But other Pikmin types start drowning when falling into the water
2016-04-11 20:13:29	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-11 20:13:54	Neocraftz1553	maybe so they don't start flying higher whenever the player goes over the water there?
2016-04-11 20:14:03	Neocraftz1553	have you tried throwing them in the water
2016-04-11 20:14:12	Marty2000	Yes, they drown when thrown
2016-04-11 20:14:36	Neocraftz1553	thats wierd...
2016-04-11 20:14:38	Neocraftz1553	hmm..

2016-04-11 21:03:00	Neocraftz1553	of..?
2016-04-11 21:03:10	Neocraftz1553	Hello everyone!
2016-04-11 21:03:22	Marty2000	Hi again!
2016-04-11 21:03:31	@Espyo	sure
2016-04-11 21:03:35	@Espyo	hi Neo
2016-04-11 21:03:37	Nvortex	the first one is, should we create a thread called "preparations for pikmin 4" in the forums? that way we can tell people what they can do, what they shouldn't do and that sort of things
2016-04-11 21:03:51	Neocraftz1553	oooh, that stuff...
2016-04-11 21:04:29	Nvortex	the other one is, will the new april fool's joke be the one we were talking about? (dlc)
2016-04-11 21:04:34	Neocraftz1553	Can someone link me to the forums? Please?
2016-04-11 21:04:44	@Espyo	well, it's still REALLY soon to decide the new April Fool's
2016-04-11 21:04:49	Nvortex	http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/
2016-04-11 21:04:51	@Espyo	plus, I'm not the one that decides, we all do, together
2016-04-11 21:04:59	@Espyo	but yeah, we can make a thread, but I'm wondering if it's too soon
2016-04-11 21:05:02	Neocraftz1553	I mean, we just put out an april fools...
2016-04-11 21:05:14	@Espyo	I've got a set of instructions up already, so yeah, it'll be important to make those public
2016-04-11 21:05:18	@Espyo	but I don't think there's any rush
2016-04-11 21:05:19	Neocraftz1553	thanks Nvortex
2016-04-11 21:05:21	Nvortex	i was thinking on asking scruffy to make a render of this with extremely buff pikmin http://40.media.tumblr.com/24f67e74a687fb2ac4079f40543a27df/tumblr_nqnwafYViw1s04a53o1_r1_1280.jpg
2016-04-11 21:05:26	@Espyo	Nintendo's being slower than Valve...
2016-04-11 21:05:39	@Espyo	that is pretty buff
2016-04-11 21:06:10	Nvortex	i mean like dragon ball buff, thats why i wanted to ask him if theres a limit to what he can do
2016-04-11 21:06:17	Nvortex	well not dragon ball level
2016-04-11 21:06:21	Nvortex	just muscular
2016-04-11 21:06:39	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-11 21:07:00	Neocraftz1553	He is pretty talented, I'm sure he can think of SOMEthing
2016-04-11 21:07:23	Neocraftz1553	theres a lot of things you can do to make different levels of buffness
2016-04-11 21:07:58	Neocraftz1553	Why doesn't the proboards forgot password work??
2016-04-11 21:08:20	@Espyo	he probably can, but it's probably pretty hard
2016-04-11 21:08:29	Nvortex	not something like this http://lohas.nicoseiga.jp/thumb/3247162i

2016-04-11 21:08:58	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-04-11 21:09:17	Neocraftz1553	what kind of buffness, Nvortex?
2016-04-11 21:10:17	Neocraftz1553	ARRRgh
2016-04-11 21:10:20	Neocraftz1553	this is madness!!!
2016-04-11 21:10:50	Neocraftz1553	I the forgot password link keeps on taking me to the same page!!!
2016-04-11 21:11:05	Neocraftz1553	ITS LIKE REFRESHING THE DAMN PAGE!!!
2016-04-11 21:11:17	@Espyo	hm, weird
2016-04-11 21:11:50	Neocraftz1553	Proboards, if I wanted to refresh the page I would have refreshed it already, and I wouldn't have done it 5 times in a row...
2016-04-11 21:18:49	Nvortex	i don't know about you espyo but the reason wikia got where it is was because we "rushed" new pages
2016-04-11 21:18:56	Nvortex	and i want that to be the case here
2016-04-11 21:19:26	Nvortex	if no names are revealed we put them in a single page
2016-04-11 21:19:35	Nvortex	when name is reealed we make a separate page
2016-04-11 21:20:31	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-11 21:20:41	Neocraftz1553	so...
2016-04-11 21:20:45	Neocraftz1553	in pikmin 3's case...
2016-04-11 21:20:59	Nvortex	once we have the game we should take pictures of everything like exploration notes and stuff as soon as we find them
2016-04-11 21:21:07	Neocraftz1553	when the characters were revealed, we make a single page...
2016-04-11 21:21:12	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-11 21:21:20	Neocraftz1553	wait...

2016-04-11 21:24:07	Nvortex	but we need to show people that we are ready to make content
2016-04-11 21:24:17	Nvortex	that we are interested

2016-04-11 21:37:35	@Espyo	I thought about all of that, Nvortex
2016-04-11 21:37:43	@Espyo	plus, we actually discussed it on skype once or twice
2016-04-11 21:37:58	Nvortex	about the rushing of pages?
2016-04-11 21:38:13	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-11 21:38:30	Nvortex	i'm talking about once we have the game
2016-04-11 21:38:43	Nvortex	last time we were discussing before the release (i think)

2016-04-11 21:38:50	@Espyo	oh, I get you
2016-04-11 21:38:54	@Espyo	well, I guess the same more or less applies
2016-04-11 21:39:08	@Espyo	I mean, in one trailer, you can expect a hundred edits in a day from everybody
2016-04-11 21:39:16	@Espyo	they might only last one day, because a trailer only shows so much
2016-04-11 21:39:26	@Espyo	and a game release should have 100 edits per day over several days
2016-04-11 21:39:27	@Espyo	but
2016-04-11 21:39:30	@Espyo	it's still a lot of info at once
2016-04-11 21:39:34	@Espyo	so the same logic kinda applies
2016-04-11 21:39:34	Nvortex	i was thinking on writing down in the thread about taking pictures of exploration notes, piklopedia (if its there) and stuff like that 
2016-04-11 21:39:36	Nvortex	and yes
2016-04-11 21:39:37	Nvortex	the trailer
2016-04-11 21:39:39	Nvortex	oh boy
2016-04-11 21:39:44	@Espyo	right
2016-04-11 21:39:50	Nvortex	well chances are they will automaticaly go to wikia
2016-04-11 21:39:54	Nvortex	that's sad
2016-04-11 21:39:57	Nvortex	but in our wiki
2016-04-11 21:40:11	@Espyo	don't sweat it
2016-04-11 21:40:13	Nvortex	we have less editors so i think we wont have that much activity
2016-04-11 21:40:18	@Espyo	so long as we're ahead, we've got this
2016-04-11 21:40:23	@Espyo	actually, we have more editors
2016-04-11 21:40:30	@Espyo	wikia doesn't get any activity in the past half year
2016-04-11 21:40:30	Nvortex	we aren't, kirby is crazy right now
2016-04-11 21:40:34	Nvortex	alliances and shit

2016-04-11 21:40:40	Nvortex	oh
2016-04-11 21:40:48	@Espyo	honestly, are you scared about kirby's "plans"?
2016-04-11 21:40:53	@Espyo	the guy doesn't even know how Pikmin works
2016-04-11 21:40:57	@Espyo	he doesn't know how to run a wiki
2016-04-11 21:40:59	Nvortex	i'm scared of people going there because they see ativity
2016-04-11 21:41:10	@Espyo	don't fret
2016-04-11 21:41:12	Nvortex	and kirby answers to stuff as soon as possible
2016-04-11 21:41:20	@Espyo	if he answers wrong, all the better
2016-04-11 21:41:40	Nvortex	well what if they believe it, and the lie starts spreading
2016-04-11 21:41:43	@Espyo	anyway, 30% of people will find wikis through google, 30% through checking wikis on NIWA and wikia, and 30% from external sites like reddit
2016-04-11 21:41:51	@Espyo	if we can conquer the google search leads and the reddit side
2016-04-11 21:41:54	@Espyo	we've got this in the bag
2016-04-11 21:42:02	@Espyo	more popularity on our side means more people come here and not on wikia
2016-04-11 21:42:07	@Espyo	which will eventually make it die out
2016-04-11 21:42:19	@Espyo	if the lies start spreading, we'll have interesting stuff to put on our Myths article
2016-04-11 21:42:27	@Espyo	I'm gonna create the article in a few days
2016-04-11 21:42:31	@Espyo	it's been on backlog for ages
2016-04-11 21:42:31	Nvortex	well, i remmber when 3 was released i saw that bulbapedia had a banner telling people to look this wiki
2016-04-11 21:42:34	@Espyo	but I'm always so busy
2016-04-11 21:42:45	@Espyo	really?
2016-04-11 21:42:48	Nvortex	yeah
2016-04-11 21:42:48	@Espyo	I don't remember this
2016-04-11 21:42:52	Nvortex	i do clearly
2016-04-11 21:42:54	@Espyo	but 3 was a different thing
2016-04-11 21:42:58	@Espyo	both wikis were pretty much asleep
2016-04-11 21:43:03	@Espyo	this time, that's not the case
2016-04-11 21:43:06	Nvortex	we can ask them for that little help again
2016-04-11 21:43:11	@Espyo	we sure can
2016-04-11 21:43:18	@Espyo	that's actually a great idea
2016-04-11 21:43:21	@Espyo	let me add it to the plan
2016-04-11 21:43:27	Nvortex	well i dont know if it was bulbapedia or the whole niwa that had the banner

2016-04-11 21:45:27	Marty2000	When I joined this wiki nearly 2 months ago, I had looked for a wiki on the Internet, and found Pikmin Wikia and Pikipedia... I wanted to know what was the better amongst the two, so I compared the information the two had... Pikipedia was clearly better. And when I see wikia, it's not that I detest it, I have nothing against it, but it is supposed to have 
2016-04-11 21:45:29	Marty2000	merged and the information we can find on it today is "often" wrong.
2016-04-11 21:46:07	Marty2000	(well, some information are true, but they are in Pikipedia as well). It's too bad it appears first in google searches, though

2016-04-11 21:46:24	Nvortex	it's good to hear that there is sensible people
2016-04-11 21:46:28	@Espyo	sure is
2016-04-11 21:46:36	@Espyo	just to make it clear, so it doesn't look like we have a weird vendetta
2016-04-11 21:46:43	@Espyo	we want the wiki on wikia gone for several reasons
2016-04-11 21:46:48	@Espyo	but "revenge" isn't really one of them
2016-04-11 21:46:57	@Espyo	seeing wikia suffer by having the Pikmin wikia removed is nice and all
2016-04-11 21:47:03	@Espyo	but the biggest reasons for wanting the other wiki gone are:
2016-04-11 21:47:10	@Espyo	we don't want people to learn more lies
2016-04-11 21:47:17	@Espyo	the Winged Pikmin being stronger lie is STILL there

2016-04-11 21:47:28	Nvortex	chugga believed it
2016-04-11 21:47:30	@Espyo	so that we don't have two forces of people working on the same information
2016-04-11 21:47:33	@Espyo	which is just a waste of effort
2016-04-11 21:47:35	Nvortex	and he said it in a video

2016-04-11 21:48:42	Marty2000	What could we do to help?
2016-04-11 21:48:46	@Espyo	that Pikipedia is just some ploy to fight a corporation or something done
2016-04-11 21:48:55	@Espyo	honestly, nothing
2016-04-11 21:48:57	@Espyo	that's the best part
2016-04-11 21:49:02	Marty2000	OKay
2016-04-11 21:49:06	@Espyo	by simply being a part of the community and just working on the wiki for fun
2016-04-11 21:49:11	@Espyo	Pikipedia grows
2016-04-11 21:49:18	@Espyo	which is our best tool for this
2016-04-11 21:49:27	@Espyo	so just keep making articles, discoveries, and friends
2016-04-11 21:49:30	Nvortex	hey, i've been meaning to say this since i read it the first time but we started talkinga bout something else
2016-04-11 21:49:35	@Espyo	and that just makes Pikipedia a better place
2016-04-11 21:49:40	@Espyo	yeah?
2016-04-11 21:49:49	Nvortex	why wait for the relese to have the {{|p4}} related stuff
2016-04-11 21:49:49	Testyo	"|p4" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:|p4
2016-04-11 21:50:27	Neocraftz1553	Bad title...
2016-04-11 21:50:30	Nvortex	if its a template cant it be done before 
2016-04-11 21:50:34	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-11 21:50:41	Nvortex	it isnt created yet
2016-04-11 21:50:52	Nvortex	those are templates that dont exist yet
2016-04-11 21:50:56	Neocraftz1553	just noticed that...
2016-04-11 21:51:03	@Espyo	wait, what on, exactly?
2016-04-11 21:51:23	Nvortex	 -Create the template {{p4}}.
2016-04-11 21:51:23	Testyo	"p4" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:p4
2016-04-11 21:51:41	Nvortex	well first i think i need to understand what a template is
2016-04-11 21:51:48	Nvortex	but why not have them done before tme
2016-04-11 21:52:07	@Espyo	a template is like {{clean}}
2016-04-11 21:52:07	Testyo	"clean" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:clean
2016-04-11 21:52:21	@Espyo	when you type "{{clean}}" on the article, it automatically places a box, the text "this article needs to be cleaned up", etc.
2016-04-11 21:52:21	Testyo	"clean" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:clean
2016-04-11 21:52:25	@Espyo	it's like an expansion thingie
2016-04-11 21:52:42	@Espyo	templates can also take parameters, which are done like {{clean|the info is outdated}}
2016-04-11 21:52:42	Testyo	"clean|the_info_is_outdated" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:clean|the_info_is_outdated
2016-04-11 21:52:51	@Espyo	which causes the box to appear, with the text and all, and also the parameter you passed
2016-04-11 21:53:08	@Espyo	right, in that particular case...
2016-04-11 21:53:16	@Espyo	that template would be like the {{p1}}, {{p2}}, etc. templates
2016-04-11 21:53:16	Testyo	"p1" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:p1
2016-04-11 21:53:21	@Espyo	I guess it is useful to have it before the game releases
2016-04-11 21:53:26	@Espyo	heck, when news are announced, even
2016-04-11 21:53:31	@Espyo	because we'll be linking to the Pikmin 4 article a LOT
2016-04-11 21:53:43	Nvortex	oh i get it now
2016-04-11 21:53:48	@Espyo	I must've moved to the "after the game releases" part to not put too many things on the "before the game releases" part
2016-04-11 21:53:53	@Espyo	that must've been my reasoning
2016-04-11 21:53:58	@Espyo	but yeah, I agree, it should be done before the game releases
2016-04-11 21:54:02	Nvortex	(i've been writing down everything in italics and stuff all this time)
2016-04-11 21:54:17	Nvortex	i blame wikia
2016-04-11 21:54:24	Nvortex	they never explained anything
2016-04-11 21:54:28	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-04-11 21:54:32	Nvortex	and im not sure it had a "how to edit"
2016-04-11 21:54:35	@Espyo	[[Help:Quick start guide]]
2016-04-11 21:54:36	Testyo	"Help:Quick_start_guide" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Help:Quick_start_guide
2016-04-11 21:54:42	Nvortex	(mostly our fault tho, we didn't either)
2016-04-11 21:54:44	@Espyo	I made that in an attempt to help in just those scenarios ^
2016-04-11 21:54:56	Nvortex	we were basically reverse engineering pages done before our arrival
2016-04-11 21:54:56	@Espyo	wikia just relies on the "you don't need to learn anything, stuff just happens!"
2016-04-11 21:55:07	@Espyo	and then when stuff doesn't happen, or you need more stuff to happen, you're screwed
2016-04-11 21:55:12	@Espyo	I get their idea, to make it easier for everybody
2016-04-11 21:55:20	@Espyo	but it ends up hurting stuff in the long run
2016-04-11 21:55:26	@Espyo	once again, just proves how wikia doesn't really care about quality
2016-04-11 21:55:37	@Espyo	as long as a lot of people spend their time on the site, that's all that matters
2016-04-11 21:55:38	Nvortex	something i never uderstood was why some pages had the simple edit design or hatver
2016-04-11 21:55:50	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2016-04-11 21:55:58	Nvortex	and some had niwa layout (no i-do-it-for-you button)
2016-04-11 21:56:04	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-11 21:56:25	Nvortex	because of that we couldnt edit some pages
2016-04-11 21:56:33	Nvortex	i don't know if it got fixed now in an update)
2016-04-11 21:57:27	@Espyo	weird
2016-04-11 21:57:32	Nvortex	you have PAL versions right?
2016-04-11 21:57:58	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-11 21:58:08	Nvortex	there is the chance that the game will be released first in europe (happened with 3) do you think you wil be able to have 4 on release?
2016-04-11 21:58:45	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-04-11 21:59:00	Neocraftz1553	I hope Nintendo leaves 4 out longer this time around
2016-04-11 21:59:13	Nvortex	or worldwide release
2016-04-11 21:59:24	Nvortex	im really scared of japanese videos
2016-04-11 21:59:27	Neocraftz1553	that would be nice...
2016-04-11 21:59:28	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-11 21:59:34	Nvortex	what if kirby wants to have the info before
2016-04-11 21:59:42	Nvortex	and creates stuff without knowing the name
2016-04-11 21:59:45	Nvortex	"spider enemy thing"
2016-04-11 21:59:48	Nvortex	"ball of fire"
2016-04-11 21:59:49	@Espyo	I very likely will have 4 on release
2016-04-11 21:59:55	Neocraftz1553	he did that?
2016-04-11 22:00:00	@Espyo	I don't think kirby has enough energy for that
2016-04-11 22:00:07	@Espyo	there are so many important things I see on wikia all the time
2016-04-11 22:00:08	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-04-11 22:00:09	@Espyo	and he ignores them
2016-04-11 22:00:11	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-11 22:00:16	@Espyo	even when somebody makes a bad edit that needs to be reverted
2016-04-11 22:00:20	@Espyo	he takes like 3 days to notice
2016-04-11 22:00:22	@Espyo	plus, remember
2016-04-11 22:00:26	@Espyo	he's a kid with down's
2016-04-11 22:00:33	@Espyo	his parents already have to spend thousands for his medication
2016-04-11 22:00:37	@Espyo	they can't afford a game
2016-04-11 22:00:39	Neocraftz1553	really?
2016-04-11 22:00:43	@Espyo	lol
2016-04-11 22:00:45	@Espyo	nah, not really
2016-04-11 22:00:48	@Espyo	...at least, I don't think so
2016-04-11 22:00:50	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-04-11 22:00:54	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-04-11 22:01:09	@Espyo	but I wouldn't be surprised if he's a spoiled brat
2016-04-11 22:01:22	Neocraftz1553	wait, so if I go over and trash the place... he won't notice immediately?
2016-04-11 22:01:34	Neocraftz1553	I won't do that, but...

2016-04-11 22:02:24	Marty2000	Hi En_Passant
2016-04-11 22:02:25	@Espyo	well, he could notice it immediatelly
2016-04-11 22:02:28	@Espyo	or he could take a while
2016-04-11 22:02:35	@Espyo	I don't know, it's just that when I check the recent changes on wikia
2016-04-11 22:02:41	@Espyo	sometimes I see bad edits stick around for 1 or 2 days
2016-04-11 22:02:42	En_Passant	hi guys
2016-04-11 22:02:43	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-11 22:03:11	En_Passant	Is there any way to automatically identify with NickServ? Typing in a password every time is tedious
2016-04-11 22:03:12	Neocraftz1553	I didn't know En_Passant was a term in chess until I read this one story...
2016-04-11 22:04:17	@Espyo	there is
2016-04-11 22:04:20	@Espyo	you're using Mibbit, right?
2016-04-11 22:04:27	@Espyo	wait, are you using the chat page on the wiki?
2016-04-11 22:04:40	Neocraftz1553	I am...
2016-04-11 22:04:42	En_Passant	yes
2016-04-11 22:05:05	Neocraftz1553	Is that Mibbit .3.
2016-04-11 22:05:15	En_Passant	Which one, Neo?
2016-04-11 22:05:26	Neocraftz1553	either one is mibbit
2016-04-11 22:05:34	Nvortex	i use the chat page on the wiki too
2016-04-11 22:06:01	@Espyo	you can use chat.mibbit.com instead
2016-04-11 22:06:10	@Espyo	and you can make an account there
2016-04-11 22:06:22	@Espyo	and from there, you can set up what networks, channels, etc. to auto-join and identify
2016-04-11 22:06:30	@Espyo	other than that, you can use a program instead of a webpage
2016-04-11 22:06:36	@Espyo	but besides that, there's no real way to auto-identify
2016-04-11 22:09:00	Neocraftz1553	you don't have to identify every time though
2016-04-11 22:09:09	@Espyo	yeah, you don't need to
2016-04-11 22:09:17	@Espyo	well, I guess you do
2016-04-11 22:09:19	@Espyo	if you created an account
2016-04-11 22:11:57	Neocraftz1553	I don't always identify, if I keep on disconnecting
2016-04-11 22:12:28	Neocraftz1553	Does /register count as an making an account..?
2016-04-11 22:12:50	Marty2000	I ddin't even know you could make an account. I guess I always connect as a guest here
2016-04-11 22:12:56	Marty2000	didn't*
2016-04-11 22:13:48	Neocraftz1553	So we will never know if you are you °3°

2016-04-11 22:44:33	@Espyo	it looks authentic, but not viscous enough
2016-04-11 22:44:43	@Espyo	looks more plasticky than not
2016-04-11 22:44:57	@Espyo	are the eyes right? they should go to the left and right, but they look like they're also going a bit forward and back

2016-04-11 22:45:38	Neo	depth is kinda messed up, so I might change the position...
2016-04-11 22:45:54	Neo	It does look more... solid... metallic, perhaps?
2016-04-11 22:46:33	Neo	hmm...
2016-04-11 22:46:48	Neo	If I down the glossy, it'll look like water...
2016-04-11 22:46:49	Marty2000	Well, maybe you all know it but... a Pikmin seed (in P2 and P3) always has a leaf : http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/15/1460411176-pikmin-seed-leaf.png
2016-04-11 22:46:56	Marty2000	But did you know that in Pikmin (1)
2016-04-11 22:46:59	Neo	uh...
2016-04-11 22:47:08	Marty2000	They could have buds : http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/15/1460411175-pikmin-seed-flower.png
2016-04-11 22:47:09	Neo	in P 1 there are flowers...

2016-04-11 22:49:56	Marty2000	Yep, too bad they don't sprout as flowers or buds...
2016-04-11 22:51:21	ScruffyChat	Wait, they go back to being leaves?
2016-04-11 22:51:56	Marty2000	Yes

2016-04-11 22:52:18	Marty2000	(by the way this only happens in P1)
2016-04-11 22:52:29	Marty2000	I think we should add that somewhere
2016-04-11 22:52:30	ScruffyChat	Weird

2016-04-11 22:59:00	Marty2000	I meant that Pikmin seeds can have flowers or buds in Pikmin (1)
2016-04-11 22:59:01	En_Passant	I missed the situation where it happens
2016-04-11 22:59:23	Marty2000	But they will still sprout in leaf form

2016-04-12 01:44:32	ScruffyChat	Hi Neo
2016-04-12 01:44:59	ScruffyChat	I created a new version of the Piktop Camera function
2016-04-12 01:45:13	ScruffyChat	After thinking for a while how the GUI ought to look
2016-04-12 01:45:16	ScruffyChat	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/2/2d/WoollyBulborbPikipediaregistering.png
2016-04-12 01:45:34	Neocraftz1553	ah, lemme see
2016-04-12 01:45:35	ScruffyChat	Thank you for the help on it!
2016-04-12 01:46:01	Neocraftz1553	No problem! Happy to help!
2016-04-12 01:49:10	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, I might request for music... many days into the future, though
2016-04-12 01:49:32	ScruffyChat	Sure, no problem!
2016-04-12 01:53:53	Neocraftz1553	Its an underwater tune... I need 2-3 variations... They will be mostly on soft tones like flutes...
2016-04-12 01:53:53	Neocraftz1553	no need to work on the now, not untill I request
2016-04-12 01:54:57	Neocraftz1553	Oh yeah, and I finally updated to blender 2.77a...
2016-04-12 01:54:57	Neocraftz1553	but I had to re install all my add-ons (only like, 2) and update my user preferences....
2016-04-12 01:54:57	Neocraftz1553	but hey, at least they added more options
2016-04-12 01:54:57	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, do you know what a... procedural texture is?
2016-04-12 02:04:15	Neocraftz1553	I found out how to make one for dirt/sanx
2016-04-12 02:04:15	Neocraftz1553	*Sand
2016-04-12 02:05:57	ScruffyChat	Nice
2016-04-12 02:06:14	ScruffyChat	A procedural texture is one that doesn't have to be mapped
2016-04-12 02:06:37	ScruffyChat	It's based on randomization
2016-04-12 02:06:44	ScruffyChat	Or an equation

2016-04-12 02:13:26	Neocraftz1553	the beauty of 'em
2016-04-12 02:13:26	Neocraftz1553	Its using a Wave texture on displacement, Scale 10, distortion 10, Detail 5, Detail Scale 2
2016-04-12 02:13:26	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-12 02:13:40	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2016-04-12 02:14:01	ScruffyChat	I'm about to upload a ton of info to Pikmin Fanon
2016-04-12 02:14:22	ScruffyChat	I've totally planned out the game's Challenge Mode, and it's time to implement that
2016-04-12 02:14:28	ScruffyChat	But it might take a while
2016-04-12 02:14:45	Neocraftz1553	just said the beauty of them
2016-04-12 02:14:45	Neocraftz1553	and the above 
2016-04-12 02:14:45	Neocraftz1553	and then you mix a diffuse and an Ashikmin Shirely Glossy set to .5
2016-04-12 02:14:45	Neocraftz1553	Mix ratio 975-025
2016-04-12 02:14:45	Neocraftz1553	something like that
2016-04-12 02:14:47	Neocraftz1553	expirement, it looks pretty cool
2016-04-12 02:15:31	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-12 02:16:03	Neocraftz1553	also, for the above, maybe try mixing in a Noise or Voronoi texture to the displacement, to add...
2016-04-12 02:16:03	Neocraftz1553	grainyness...
2016-04-12 02:16:14	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2016-04-12 02:20:04	Neocraftz1553	Also, can you give me some feedback on my last Wollywog render?
2016-04-12 02:23:11	ScruffyChat	It's well-modeled, creepy looking
2016-04-12 02:23:33	ScruffyChat	But I would put a light on the other side of it, to give it some more depth

2016-04-12 16:44:27	Neocraftz1553	Nice!
2016-04-12 16:44:48	Neocraftz1553	Hey, didn't know you had a snail enemy...
2016-04-12 16:44:52	Neocraftz1553	or should I say....

2016-04-12 16:45:28	Scruffy	Yep, it's actually a mixture of "spring" and "prawn"
2016-04-12 16:45:36	Neocraftz1553	Nice!
2016-04-12 16:45:51	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, how did you make the box art for PF?
2016-04-12 16:45:52	Scruffy	The full name is actually Auger Sprawn, because it has an auger shell
2016-04-12 16:46:00	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see
2016-04-12 16:46:27	Scruffy	In Blender of course, I just created an Onion, some simple landscape and a plane of stars behind it, and two trees I made with the Sapling addon
2016-04-12 16:46:53	Scruffy	Then I borrowed the Pikmin logo and took off the 3 in an image editor
2016-04-12 16:47:02	Scruffy	And found a template for Wii U box covers
2016-04-12 16:47:49	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see

2016-04-12 21:35:03	Marty2000	Ha ha, it's okay
2016-04-12 21:35:30	UltraMario	spooky
2016-04-12 21:35:36	Neocraftz1553	yup...
2016-04-12 21:37:23	Neocraftz1553	What are you all doin at this time?
2016-04-12 21:38:57	Marty2000	Nothing really interesting... I'm trying to find something to contribute to on Pikipedia, because I can't upload "high-quality" images... I'm not at home and I don't have my recorder. I think I should complete the NPC! Olimar's monologues
2016-04-12 21:39:32	@Espyo	it's possible to upload high quality images without a capture card
2016-04-12 21:39:37	Klemen702	all i'm doing is chatting shit 
2016-04-12 21:39:38	Marty2000	I know

2016-04-12 21:39:46	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-12 21:39:51	Marty2000	And others
2016-04-12 21:39:52	@Espyo	there's a better way
2016-04-12 21:39:58	@Espyo	you use the Home menu while you're playing, go to the web browser, and enter Pikipedia that way
2016-04-12 21:40:13	@Espyo	it's more straightforward, and actually saves the image in a higher resolution
2016-04-12 21:40:17	Marty2000	Ah, okay. Thanks. 
2016-04-12 21:40:25	Marty2000	Can the images be cropped?
2016-04-12 21:40:25	@Espyo	you're welcome
2016-04-12 21:40:29	@Espyo	they can't

2016-04-12 23:36:27	@Espyo	but the area editor is a LOT better on some parts

2016-04-12 23:37:33	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok! Good thing gates were resized!
2016-04-12 23:38:24	@Espyo	yeah, Jordan pointed out 20 pellets couldn't fit
2016-04-12 23:38:26	@Espyo	couldn't have that
2016-04-12 23:38:32	@Espyo	I checked in P1, and gates are like twice as big
2016-04-12 23:38:36	@Espyo	so I increased a good amount
2016-04-12 23:39:21	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok

2016-04-12 23:47:54	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, I am guessing 8.0 hazards might take a little less than the others, right? With the "Universal Hazards" and everything...
2016-04-12 23:48:08	Neocraftz1553	We just need to figure out how to do it :|
2016-04-12 23:48:08	@Espyo	I've thought about how I'll do this
2016-04-12 23:48:14	@Espyo	and I think I know what to do
2016-04-12 23:48:18	@Espyo	and it should be actually pretty simple
2016-04-12 23:48:26	@Espyo	IF all goes well, I can finish the hazards in a month
2016-04-12 23:48:40	@Espyo	but I'll probably focus on also making a few obstacles and enemies that use the hazards
2016-04-12 23:48:43	Neocraftz1553	mmhm
2016-04-12 23:48:43	@Espyo	so it might take a bit longer still
2016-04-12 23:48:48	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-12 23:50:12	Neocraftz1553	Some ideas: Frost gate, Flame gate, Electric gate, Poison Pipe, Electric wires, Geysers, Fiery bulblax, Goolix...
2016-04-12 23:50:48	Neocraftz1553	And an idea for a custom enemy...
2016-04-12 23:50:56	@Espyo	maybe
2016-04-12 23:50:57	Neocraftz1553	Frosty Ivy...
2016-04-12 23:51:02	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-04-12 23:51:14	Neocraftz1553	A plant enemy that uses "Frost"
2016-04-12 23:51:32	Neocraftz1553	Hazard makes Pikmin slow to a stop and die if not whistled
2016-04-12 23:51:39	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-12 23:51:46	@Espyo	yeah, that's possible with the plans I have
2016-04-12 23:52:13	Neocraftz1553	Cool
2016-04-12 23:52:24	Neocraftz1553	See what I did there :p

2016-04-12 23:55:10	Neocraftz1553	Hey, you can detonate a Dirigibugs bomb rocks mid air...
2016-04-12 23:55:56	Neocraftz1553	With a Purple Pikmin.
2016-04-12 23:56:01	@Espyo	you sure?
2016-04-12 23:56:06	Neocraftz1553	Learned that with 20 Purples
2016-04-12 23:56:11	Neocraftz1553	they are now dead
2016-04-12 23:56:27	Neocraftz1553	uh... last week, I was playing challenge mode and that happened
2016-04-12 23:58:02	Neocraftz1553	it was this one level...

2016-04-13 00:04:25	Neocraftz1553	welp, now its only me, Pikfan, and Scruffy
2016-04-13 00:04:38	Neocraftz1553	so, what is up?
2016-04-13 00:04:51	Neocraftz1553	I don't say that much, so relish the moment
2016-04-13 00:04:52	@PikFan	just got home from school
2016-04-13 00:04:59	 *	@PikFan relishes the moment
2016-04-13 00:04:59	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-04-13 00:05:03	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-13 00:06:41	Neocraftz1553	Ok, finish relishing the moment, because we...
2016-04-13 00:06:48	Neocraftz1553	are going to do something... hmm...
2016-04-13 00:07:01	Neocraftz1553	oh well, any ideas?
2016-04-13 00:07:45	 *	@PikFan parties like there's no tomorrow
2016-04-13 00:07:58	Neocraftz1553	hmmm
2016-04-13 00:08:07	@PikFan	in all seriousness though, I'm not sure
2016-04-13 00:08:27	@PikFan	oh, but since Scruffy's here, I was going to ask him about those classic Mission Mode maps
2016-04-13 00:08:53	Neocraftz1553	classic?
2016-04-13 00:09:25	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/2/29/Pikipedia_10th_Anniversary_Map.png
2016-04-13 00:09:42	@PikFan	Impact Site could be considered a "classic" map, right?
2016-04-13 00:10:02	Neocraftz1553	Oh, btw, Scruffy, excellent PikTop image
2016-04-13 00:10:16	Neocraftz1553	yeah, Pikmin 1 GC is a "classic"
2016-04-13 00:12:56	Neocraftz1553	and, it would be awsome if Nintendo remade it for the Wii U/NX....
2016-04-13 00:13:07	Neocraftz1553	I don't mean just any remake...
2016-04-13 00:13:19	UltraMario	what do you mean
2016-04-13 00:13:24	@PikFan	I'd love a Pikmin HD Trilogy remake
2016-04-13 00:13:31	@PikFan	even though Pikmin 3 is already HD
2016-04-13 00:13:33	Neocraftz1553	Retexturing, revamping logic, graphics, and all those things
2016-04-13 00:13:39	Neocraftz1553	^^
2016-04-13 00:13:40	UltraMario	well
2016-04-13 00:13:42	UltraMario	that's what a remake is
2016-04-13 00:13:43	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-13 00:13:48	UltraMario	silly
2016-04-13 00:13:57	@PikFan	...but since the NX might be 4K, then they could just make Pikmin 3 into UHD
2016-04-13 00:14:13	Neocraftz1553	I wouldn't mind, but...
2016-04-13 00:14:18	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-04-13 00:14:21	@PikFan	hi
2016-04-13 00:14:26	Neocraftz1553	some people get dizzy on UHD
2016-04-13 00:14:35	Neocraftz1553	Wb Scruffy!
2016-04-13 00:15:42	Neocraftz1553	I WANT PIKMIN 1 FOR WII U/NX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-04-13 00:15:46	Neocraftz1553	imagine...
2016-04-13 00:15:53	Scruffy	Hi hang on a sec, gotta book a flight
2016-04-13 00:16:00	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-13 00:16:02	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-13 00:16:22	@PikFan	huhwhat
2016-04-13 00:16:32	Neocraftz1553	^
2016-04-13 00:16:37	@PikFan	why do you have to book a flight?
2016-04-13 00:17:09	Neocraftz1553	Music?
2016-04-13 00:17:19	@PikFan	in other news, Stephen Hawking wants to send a gram-sized spacecraft to Alpha Centauri within 20 years to search for alien life
2016-04-13 00:17:34	Neocraftz1553	hm....
2016-04-13 00:17:57	Neocraftz1553	grams as in, grains of sand kinda grams, right?
2016-04-13 00:18:18	@PikFan	as in a 1000th of a kilogram
2016-04-13 00:18:21	@PikFan	that kind of gram
2016-04-13 00:18:27	Neocraftz1553	yeah...
2016-04-13 00:18:35	@PikFan	though I don't see how much technology you can pack into a gram
2016-04-13 00:18:35	Neocraftz1553	thats pretty small...
2016-04-13 00:18:51	Neocraftz1553	You COULD pack quite a lot...
2016-04-13 00:18:53	Neocraftz1553	but...
2016-04-13 00:19:04	Neocraftz1553	its very VERY limited...
2016-04-13 00:19:35	Neocraftz1553	and how to actually make it, I don't know...
2016-04-13 00:20:01	Neocraftz1553	Theres probably cameras that size, I think...
2016-04-13 00:20:30	Neocraftz1553	maybe you could pack in 2 Mbs or less in it...
2016-04-13 00:20:40	Scruffy	They could make a motor out of 70 atoms
2016-04-13 00:20:46	@PikFan	70?!
2016-04-13 00:20:47	Scruffy	They can pack technology so tight these days
2016-04-13 00:20:48	@PikFan	how?!
2016-04-13 00:20:54	Scruffy	They made it a motor
2016-04-13 00:20:55	Neocraftz1553	not sure how they are going to make a working transmitter...
2016-04-13 00:20:59	Scruffy	That can rotate
2016-04-13 00:21:03	Neocraftz1553	well...
2016-04-13 00:21:04	Scruffy	I don't know how
2016-04-13 00:21:29	Neocraftz1553	yeah, if they can do that, they can make a transmitter out of 200 atoms...
2016-04-13 00:21:54	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy: Magnetic fields, perhaps?
2016-04-13 00:22:20	Neocraftz1553	and electrons and protons orbit, so...
2016-04-13 00:22:31	Neocraftz1553	maybe they used something like that
2016-04-13 00:22:41	@PikFan	protons don't orbit
2016-04-13 00:22:43	@PikFan	just electrons
2016-04-13 00:22:45	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-04-13 00:22:49	Neocraftz1553	wait, no
2016-04-13 00:23:01	Neocraftz1553	Nuetrons and Protons don't orbit...
2016-04-13 00:23:08	@PikFan	Scruffy: was it... this? http://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-tiniest-motor-fits-inside-a-cell-spins-as-fast-as-a-jet-engine/
2016-04-13 00:23:12	Neocraftz1553	sorry, got mixed up there
2016-04-13 00:23:14	@PikFan	might be bigger than what you said
2016-04-13 00:23:29	Neocraftz1553	still, its astonishing
2016-04-13 00:24:05	Neocraftz1553	Maybe call in Olimar to take his S.S. Dolphin?
2016-04-13 00:24:14	Scruffy	Oh yeah, I exaggerated
2016-04-13 00:24:38	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-13 00:24:46	@PikFan	I'm not seeing any 70 anywhere
2016-04-13 00:24:53	Neocraftz1553	still, it can fit inside of a cell...
2016-04-13 00:27:09	@PikFan	that's still pretty crazy, though
2016-04-13 00:27:26	@PikFan	but enzymes are the real deal
2016-04-13 00:27:40	Neocraftz1553	enzymes?
2016-04-13 00:27:43	@PikFan	yes
2016-04-13 00:27:53	@PikFan	tiny molecular machines inside cells
2016-04-13 00:28:09	@PikFan	there are tons of different enzymes
2016-04-13 00:28:15	Neocraftz1553	ooh, I see, insulin
2016-04-13 00:28:23	Neocraftz1553	it could help diabetics
2016-04-13 00:28:41	@PikFan	for example, there's an enzyme called DNA helicase
2016-04-13 00:29:04	@PikFan	this enzyme comes along and basically unzips the DNA into two strands
2016-04-13 00:29:16	Neocraftz1553	mmhm
2016-04-13 00:29:29	@PikFan	which are then replicated by some other enzyme, forming two new copies
2016-04-13 00:29:44	Neocraftz1553	biology 101, by the way
2016-04-13 00:30:10	Neocraftz1553	but, that little motor could revolutionize lots of things
2016-04-13 00:30:22	@PikFan	yeah

2016-04-13 00:34:01	Scruffy	Ok sorry, booking flights is stressful
2016-04-13 00:34:16	Neocraftz1553	Its cool
2016-04-13 00:34:21	Neocraftz1553	and flights?
2016-04-13 00:34:24	Scruffy	I'm going to Thessaloniki in Greece this summer
2016-04-13 00:34:32	Neocraftz1553	lets just say, they scare me to no end
2016-04-13 00:34:44	Scruffy	And South Korea this May
2016-04-13 00:34:47	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-13 00:34:53	@PikFan	for what reasons?
2016-04-13 00:34:56	Scruffy	So I won't be on for 3 and a half weeks of mayb
2016-04-13 00:35:14	Scruffy	First one's for fun, second one is for a research opportunity
2016-04-13 00:35:15	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy: one step closer to North Korea's atomic bombs
2016-04-13 00:35:23	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-04-13 00:35:34	@PikFan	mmm...
2016-04-13 00:35:39	Neocraftz1553	and, what are you researching? 
2016-04-13 00:35:42	@PikFan	I wish I could visit Japan someday
2016-04-13 00:36:02	@PikFan	yeah, what are you researching?
2016-04-13 00:36:29	Neocraftz1553	"That information is classified" 
2016-04-13 00:36:32	Scruffy	MUsic composition
2016-04-13 00:36:34	Neocraftz1553	Just kiddin
2016-04-13 00:36:42	Neocraftz1553	oooh, Nice
2016-04-13 00:37:06	@PikFan	heh, of course
2016-04-13 00:37:13	@PikFan	but... you can research music?
2016-04-13 00:37:34	Neocraftz1553	You can research pretty much anything you want, I think...
2016-04-13 00:37:37	@PikFan	are you researching history of music composition, or something...?
2016-04-13 00:38:04	Neocraftz1553	Wait, what CAN'T you research?
2016-04-13 00:38:21	Scruffy	You experiment with sound
2016-04-13 00:38:22	Neocraftz1553	but, that sounds pretty cool Scruffy
2016-04-13 00:38:30	Scruffy	Really "composition research" is just writing a composition really
2016-04-13 00:38:35	Neocraftz1553	see what I did there
2016-04-13 00:38:45	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-04-13 00:38:48	@PikFan	Neocraftz1553: lol
2016-04-13 00:38:52	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-04-13 00:41:38	Neocraftz1553	take care, remember that
2016-04-13 00:42:38	@PikFan	oh oh oh
2016-04-13 00:42:45	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-13 00:42:53	@PikFan	Scruffy, have you had a chance to work on other Mission Mode maps lately?
2016-04-13 00:43:07	Scruffy	Not yet, unfortunately
2016-04-13 00:43:20	@PikFan	I see
2016-04-13 00:43:23	@PikFan	well, that's too bad
2016-04-13 00:43:39	Scruffy	The image editor software I used only allows three layers, so it took a while
2016-04-13 00:43:47	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-13 00:43:56	Neocraftz1553	Only three??
2016-04-13 00:43:58	@PikFan	time for an upgrade
2016-04-13 00:44:05	Scruffy	Heh, but that costs money
2016-04-13 00:44:10	Scruffy	I just need to use GIMP next time
2016-04-13 00:44:15	@PikFan	what about GI—yeah
2016-04-13 00:44:21	Neocraftz1553	Inkscape allows you as much as you want, and it is free
2016-04-13 00:44:26	Neocraftz1553	aaand Gimp
2016-04-13 00:44:37	Neocraftz1553	I don't use GIMP much...
2016-04-13 00:45:01	@PikFan	but anyway, not sure if you saw my post yet, but I said on the forums that I'd like to see a Final Trial remix
2016-04-13 00:45:08	Scruffy	Sure!
2016-04-13 00:45:18	Scruffy	Coming right up, although it'll still take a while
2016-04-13 00:45:34	@PikFan	I believe the Final Trial would make for a very interesting map, given how different it is from the other areas
2016-04-13 00:45:42	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-13 00:45:53	Neocraftz1553	it allows lots of combinations 
2016-04-13 00:46:00	@PikFan	but no pressure at all, take your time
2016-04-13 00:46:23	Scruffy	Sure, that'll be fun
2016-04-13 00:46:26	@PikFan	glugh, I need my computer of my own so I don't have to pester you all the time
2016-04-13 00:46:44	@PikFan	...*I need a computer of my own
2016-04-13 00:47:01	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-13 00:47:27	Neocraftz1553	I need to get a better one, and one of my own as well :/
2016-04-13 00:48:12	@PikFan	by the way, nice job on your Challenge Mode!
2016-04-13 00:50:00	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-04-13 00:51:06	Scruffy	It took a while to distribute the prizes, mainly
2016-04-13 00:51:21	Scruffy	Hang on a sec
2016-04-13 00:51:23	Scruffy	brb
2016-04-13 00:51:31	@PikFan	right, and okay
2016-04-13 00:51:38	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-13 00:51:48	@PikFan	but I think it's awesome how much variety you put into the types of challenges
2016-04-13 00:53:17	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it is awsome how he distributes them...
2016-04-13 00:53:23	Neocraftz1553	Nintendo-like?
2016-04-13 00:53:29	Neocraftz1553	is that the word?
2016-04-13 00:53:43	@PikFan	oh, I found the perfect calling for Scruffy
2016-04-13 00:53:56	@PikFan	he should become a game designer for Nintendo
2016-04-13 00:54:06	@PikFan	and a composer, too
2016-04-13 00:55:16	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-13 00:55:18	Scruffy	Well I really want to go into film/video game composition
2016-04-13 00:55:26	Scruffy	So that's kinda the best of both world
2016-04-13 00:55:27	Scruffy	s
2016-04-13 00:55:30	@PikFan	ah
2016-04-13 00:55:32	@PikFan	makes sense

2016-04-13 01:13:22	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-04-13 01:13:32	Scruffy	I saw you and NVortex showed interest again in Louie
2016-04-13 01:13:37	@PikFan	ah yes
2016-04-13 01:13:44	Neocraftz1553	(almost time to go home, anyways)
2016-04-13 01:13:45	Scruffy	And that made me realize I hadn't written anything for it in a while
2016-04-13 01:13:56	@PikFan	yeah, it's been a few months...
2016-04-13 01:14:10	Scruffy	Sorry, end of the semester is the busiest time
2016-04-13 01:14:23	@PikFan	you were detailing how Louie's parents met, right?
2016-04-13 01:14:28	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-04-13 01:14:29	@PikFan	oh, this is the end of the semester?
2016-04-13 01:14:41	Scruffy	For me, yes
2016-04-13 01:14:48	@PikFan	I see
2016-04-13 01:14:59	Scruffy	But yes, that chapter's going well
2016-04-13 01:15:04	@PikFan	yeah, end of the term are always stressful...
2016-04-13 01:15:10	Scruffy	But I realized I had trouble knowing how to end the whole thing
2016-04-13 01:15:17	@PikFan	oh
2016-04-13 01:15:24	Scruffy	But at breakfast today I got a revelation, and now I know exactly how
2016-04-13 01:15:29	Scruffy	But it's a secret
2016-04-13 01:15:52	Neocraftz1553	Louies Dark Secret, that is
2016-04-13 01:15:52	Scruffy	I've written out the final paragraph already
2016-04-13 01:16:06	Scruffy	So now I just have to write my way there
2016-04-13 01:16:18	@PikFan	yay!
2016-04-13 01:16:24	@PikFan	I can't wait to see what you've got
2016-04-13 01:18:30	@PikFan	I need to work on Chapter 6 of my story more...
2016-04-13 01:18:39	@PikFan	this one is harder to write
2016-04-13 01:19:05	@PikFan	I'm trying to emphasize the different emotions, but I'm having a hard time doing so
2016-04-13 01:19:14	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-04-13 01:19:24	@PikFan	...it might be because I'm doing it from a third-person omniscient
2016-04-13 01:19:36	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-13 01:19:42	Scruffy	Yeah, at times that point of view can seem overpowering
2016-04-13 01:19:43	@PikFan	if I focused only on Ignis's thoughts from first person, it might be easier
2016-04-13 01:19:57	Neocraftz1553	Its easier to do emotions in first person
2016-04-13 01:20:01	@PikFan	right
2016-04-13 01:20:30	Scruffy	It'd be weird to switch point of view right then, but I definitely think you can pull it off and make it meaningful to the story
2016-04-13 01:20:57	Neocraftz1553	sorry, gtg home, cyas in a little bit
2016-04-13 01:21:05	Scruffy	See ya
2016-04-13 01:23:08	@PikFan	bye
2016-04-13 01:23:27	@PikFan	I see what you're saying, and that's definitely a concern of mine regarding the change in the point of view
2016-04-13 01:24:11	@PikFan	but I really hope that I can get past this chapter soon so I can start working on chapter 7 and beyond
2016-04-13 01:24:20	Scruffy	Heh
2016-04-13 01:24:29	@PikFan	because I want to get into the exciting part of the story
2016-04-13 01:26:49	Scruffy	Well this chapter is mainly reactionary, right?
2016-04-13 01:26:54	@PikFan	yes

2016-04-13 01:27:16	@PikFan	here's what I have: http://pastebin.com/D25Jws3M
2016-04-13 01:27:45	@PikFan	please excuse all the segments everywhere, this chapter is still a long ways from being publish-worthy material
2016-04-13 01:28:00	@PikFan	feel free to make edits to it if you'd like
2016-04-13 01:33:42	Scruffy	I think what you've got so far is fine
2016-04-13 01:33:53	@PikFan	okay
2016-04-13 01:34:00	Scruffy	Good pacing
2016-04-13 01:34:08	@PikFan	oh, I've got less than 10 minutes left, so let's make this quick
2016-04-13 01:34:09	Scruffy	I don't think it has to be too much longer than this
2016-04-13 01:34:19	@PikFan	hmm, okay
2016-04-13 01:34:55	@PikFan	I was thinking I'd tie in that revelation bit to the part after Ignis wakes up
2016-04-13 01:35:02	Scruffy	and end it on the uncertainty of the pikmin explosion story
2016-04-13 01:35:04	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-04-13 01:35:32	@PikFan	uncertainty...
2016-04-13 01:35:58	@PikFan	before then, I could mention the rest of the events that happened, via Ruby and the others' recollection
2016-04-13 01:36:10	Scruffy	I mean make Ignis less confused about the explosion and more afraid of it
2016-04-13 01:36:19	@PikFan	good idea
2016-04-13 01:36:33	@PikFan	the story, plus him fainting...
2016-04-13 01:36:34	Scruffy	If I had superpowers but knew there was a way that they could make me explode, I'd be mortified and barely ever use them again
2016-04-13 01:36:46	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-13 01:37:06	@PikFan	but yeah, that's a good point, it really builds up more tension
2016-04-13 01:37:27	@PikFan	and it especially ties in the fact that the next chapter deals with him training to use the Elem
2016-04-13 01:37:52	@PikFan	so the whole time, that cloud of fear just hangs over him
2016-04-13 01:38:16	@PikFan	but anyway, what else did you think?
2016-04-13 01:38:19	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-04-13 01:38:58	Scruffy	What "place" does Ruby make her speech about Winged Pikmin
2016-04-13 01:39:06	@PikFan	oh
2016-04-13 01:39:29	Scruffy	is it like a dining hall in the Onion?
2016-04-13 01:39:35	@PikFan	so Ruby, Amber and Flare comfort Ignis
2016-04-13 01:39:47	@PikFan	after that, all the Red Pikmin start going into that area
2016-04-13 01:39:59	@PikFan	and that's when Ruby makes her speech
2016-04-13 01:40:16	Scruffy	Ah I see
2016-04-13 01:40:25	@PikFan	this happens in the northernmost part of the Awakening Wood, where you discovered the Blue Pikmin in P2
2016-04-13 01:40:30	@PikFan	except that pond has dried up
2016-04-13 01:40:41	@PikFan	so it's like it was in P1 again
2016-04-13 01:41:26	Scruffy	Ah, heh, neat
2016-04-13 01:41:37	@PikFan	originally, this was going to take place by the Snagret Hole, but then I realized having it so close to it wouldn't help their anxiety
2016-04-13 01:41:54	@PikFan	but anyway, yeah
2016-04-13 01:42:21	@PikFan	I'm not so sure about the part where Ruby hugs Ignis; I might end up deleting that part altogether
2016-04-13 01:42:41	@PikFan	but I do like the idea of him having his friends there
2016-04-13 01:42:57	@PikFan	and their cheerful, upbeat attitude makes him feel better
2016-04-13 01:43:04	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-04-13 01:43:14	Scruffy	I wouldn't make it so romantic
2016-04-13 01:43:18	Scruffy	Don't have him "nuzzle"
2016-04-13 01:43:23	@PikFan	exactly
2016-04-13 01:43:46	Scruffy	But a hug is still a good gesture after that ordeal
2016-04-13 01:43:47	@PikFan	see, this is the problem when I read romance stories: suddenly I want to do romance
2016-04-13 01:43:55	@PikFan	then I fail at it
2016-04-13 01:43:58	@PikFan	because life
2016-04-13 01:44:16	@PikFan	but that's also a good point, a friendly hug
2016-04-13 01:44:27	@PikFan	not a deep warm nuzzle, but just a casual hug
2016-04-13 01:45:19	@PikFan	but yeah, thanks for the input
2016-04-13 01:45:28	@PikFan	hopefully I'll get this chapter done soon
2016-04-13 01:45:43	Scruffy	No problem
2016-04-13 01:46:38	@PikFan	I like being able to talk to people who actually have things to say, instead of "oh, it looks good"
2016-04-13 01:46:44	@PikFan	...I'm guilty of that, too
2016-04-13 01:47:21	Scruffy	Heh, it's no big deal
2016-04-13 01:47:28	@PikFan	anyway, I gotta go
2016-04-13 01:47:30	Scruffy	Sometimes it's good to know that something looks good
2016-04-13 01:47:34	@PikFan	right
2016-04-13 01:47:43	@PikFan	see you later
2016-04-13 01:47:51	@PikFan	and good luck with Louie
2016-04-13 01:47:59	@PikFan	and all your other stuff
2016-04-13 01:48:08	Scruffy	See ya

2016-04-13 19:19:06	Neocraftz1553	It's that time of week again...
2016-04-13 19:19:17	@Espyo	hm?
2016-04-13 19:19:19	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: what time of the week?
2016-04-13 19:19:36	Neocraftz1553	not really, but, going to try to change some coed and compile the engine again
2016-04-13 19:19:49	Neocraftz1553	*code
2016-04-13 19:19:55	@Espyo	you should try to compile it as-is first
2016-04-13 19:19:57	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin fangame engine
2016-04-13 19:20:02	Neocraftz1553	yeah, ok
2016-04-13 19:20:11	@Espyo	there are some instructions on the README, actually
2016-04-13 19:20:12	Neocraftz1553	I'll install VS 15 first
2016-04-13 19:20:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah, following them
2016-04-13 19:20:30	Neocraftz1553	Allegro 5
2016-04-13 19:21:34	@Espyo	okay

2016-04-13 19:51:54	Yoshi2	I got basic zooming working, I got loading level data working, woooooooohoooooooooooooo
2016-04-13 19:52:06	Yoshi2	by the end of the week my first prototype of the editor should be ready
2016-04-13 19:55:24	@Espyo	niiiice
2016-04-13 20:00:26	Yoshi2	not yet implemented: actually changing stuff in the level, and resetting everything when loading a new level
2016-04-13 20:00:39	Yoshi2	plus a whole lot of convenience stuff and other functionality
2016-04-13 20:01:19	@Espyo	mhm
2016-04-13 20:02:30	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUU25J9Gkqo
2016-04-13 20:02:31	Yoshi2	but eh, my plan is to finish a basic prototype, dump it onto the other guy who runs the subreddit with me, and collect info from him:I
2016-04-13 20:02:33	@Espyo	wrong channel
2016-04-13 20:02:36	@Espyo	but that's pretty funny
2016-04-13 20:02:39	@Espyo	(and kinda nsfw)
2016-04-13 20:02:50	@Espyo	good grief that episode got me in stitches laughing
2016-04-13 20:03:10	@Espyo	for some reason I just feel that level editors and the like grow up bigger than what they should
2016-04-13 20:03:15	@Espyo	so, that's a good sign
2016-04-13 20:05:17	Yoshi2	I do have bigger plans for what the editor should be able to do, but all of that takes effort
2016-04-13 20:05:30	@Espyo	'course
2016-04-13 20:10:44	Yoshi2	prettying it up with icons, displaying the level terrain, improving performance, search menus, multiple selection, ...................................
2016-04-13 20:12:37	@Espyo	well, there are still priorities
2016-04-13 20:12:57	@Espyo	like, the area editor on the engine is pretty functional, and I could leave it as final if I wanted it, and it has no multiple selections

2016-04-13 20:28:23	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2016-04-13 20:29:46	Neocraftz1553	The Skeletal Wollywog was requested by Cheepy-Cheepy, can you guys give me some feedback?
2016-04-13 20:30:08	Scruffy	hi
2016-04-13 20:30:12	@Espyo	the render is a bit too dark to make out the details
2016-04-13 20:30:17	Neocraftz1553	Hello
2016-04-13 20:30:17	@Espyo	but I like it
2016-04-13 20:30:25	@Espyo	don't think there's much I would improve
2016-04-13 20:30:33	Neocraftz1553	Espyo: It's a cave, and the Skeletal Wollywog has to be cloaked in darkness
2016-04-13 20:30:42	@Espyo	right
2016-04-13 20:30:50	Neocraftz1553	I probably will make the Wollywog absorb more light
2016-04-13 20:31:05	Scruffy	Still, you don't want any of it to be too dark
2016-04-13 20:31:11	Scruffy	That's very important in game design
2016-04-13 20:31:18	Neocraftz1553	So modstly the eyes will be visible
2016-04-13 20:31:27	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy: I know, right?
2016-04-13 20:31:32	Scruffy	Especially when people will be playing on a reflective screen
2016-04-13 20:31:35	Neocraftz1553	Thats why caves are hard to make...
2016-04-13 20:31:56	Scruffy	I liked the touch in Pikmin 3, they used a slightly lighter color than black
2016-04-13 20:32:11	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-13 20:32:20	Scruffy	And everything still had subtle glossiness so you could perceive distant surfaces
2016-04-13 20:32:37	Scruffy	But not too contrasting that darkness became a non-threat
2016-04-13 20:32:55	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-13 20:33:17	Neocraftz1553	Glossiness and Grayness...
2016-04-13 20:33:23	Neocraftz1553	I think I can simulate that
2016-04-13 20:33:38	Scruffy	Take a look at screenshots of Pikmin 3 caves for reference
2016-04-13 20:33:58	Neocraftz1553	I also use a completely black transperent shader so that the Wollywog is hard to spot without it's eyes
2016-04-13 20:34:05	Scruffy	It does get dark, but you can still see things in the background
2016-04-13 20:34:27	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, thats what I am trying ta do
2016-04-13 20:38:30	Neocraftz1553	I think the glossyiness in blender is around 0.00-0.10 Roughness to simulate it somewhat accurately
2016-04-13 20:38:48	Neocraftz1553	probably 95:05 mix...
2016-04-13 20:38:54	Neocraftz1553	diffuse:glossy
2016-04-13 20:39:12	Scruffy	You could also use Layer Weight to keep the glossiness edge-based
2016-04-13 20:39:24	Scruffy	Layer Weight is a node in the Input category
2016-04-13 20:39:37	Scruffy	It basically does the same thing as Fresnel, but somehow it's better
2016-04-13 20:39:50	Neocraftz1553	use it as a fac, yeah?
2016-04-13 20:39:54	Scruffy	Ype
2016-04-13 20:39:56	Scruffy	Yep*
2016-04-13 20:39:57	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-13 20:40:08	Scruffy	When you do, the order of the mixed shaders does matter
2016-04-13 20:40:27	Neocraftz1553	diffuse:glossy, or glossy:diffuse?
2016-04-13 20:40:35	Neocraftz1553	yeah, learned order countsd
2016-04-13 20:40:43	Neocraftz1553	I'll find out right now

2016-04-13 20:43:21	@Espyo	I think it's a bit too...
2016-04-13 20:43:24	@Espyo	well, for one thing, formal
2016-04-13 20:43:35	@Espyo	for another, kinda condescending
2016-04-13 20:43:45	@Espyo	like, you're telling users "you'll need this page to get good"
2016-04-13 20:43:51	@Espyo	but they might already be good at wikis
2016-04-13 20:43:54	@Espyo	thoughts?
2016-04-13 20:44:09	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-13 20:44:21	Neocraftz1553	hold up
2016-04-13 20:44:41	@Espyo	for context: whenever somebody makes an account, one of us should go to their talk page and plop that template

2016-04-13 20:45:47	Neocraftz1553	So...
2016-04-13 20:45:56	Neocraftz1553	You want us to suggest changes?
2016-04-13 20:46:02	Neocraftz1553	or...
2016-04-13 20:46:07	@Espyo	just want to hear your thoughts, really
2016-04-13 20:46:13	@Espyo	see if you agree with me thinking it's a bit too formal and such
2016-04-13 20:46:19	Neocraftz1553	ah, yes
2016-04-13 20:46:20	@Espyo	or if you think it should be changed to something else completely
2016-04-13 20:46:22	Neocraftz1553	very much

2016-04-13 20:46:34	Neocraftz1553	not something else completely, though
2016-04-13 20:46:52	Neocraftz1553	something informal like...
2016-04-13 20:47:28	Neocraftz1553	Yo DAWG!!!!!! We 2 C00L H3Re, W37COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-04-13 20:47:28	Testyo	00 l = 0 gl / 0 pints
2016-04-13 20:47:31	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-04-13 20:48:09	Neocraftz1553	But it is too formal...
2016-04-13 20:49:00	Neocraftz1553	I mean...
2016-04-13 20:49:13	@Espyo	I think I know what to change it to
2016-04-13 20:49:19	@Espyo	pretty much the same, but a bit looser
2016-04-13 20:49:26	Neocraftz1553	If someone gets a greeting like that, they would be like: Oh, well this is really formal wiki...
2016-04-13 20:49:42	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-04-13 20:49:45	Neocraftz1553	they will act extremely formal fearing they'd get a ban :/
2016-04-13 20:49:53	@Espyo	"I'm afraid of messing up because I'm not up to their perfect standards"
2016-04-13 20:49:58	@Espyo	I'm scared people will think that
2016-04-13 20:49:59	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-13 20:50:24	Scruffy	I feel that it's not too invasive
2016-04-13 20:50:34	Scruffy	And certainly not too formal
2016-04-13 20:50:35	Neocraftz1553	invasive?
2016-04-13 20:50:40	Scruffy	Intelligent, but not formal
2016-04-13 20:51:00	@Espyo	what, the current greeting?
2016-04-13 20:51:03	Scruffy	Invasive on your spirit of helping the wiki, that is
2016-04-13 20:51:04	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-04-13 20:51:07	Scruffy	I didn't mind it
2016-04-13 20:51:11	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-13 20:51:17	Scruffy	I looked at the help pages before I signed up
2016-04-13 20:51:21	@Espyo	but I'm afraid little children will
2016-04-13 20:51:28	@Espyo	well, not LITTLE children
2016-04-13 20:51:39	@Espyo	but people who care a lot less than you do might be shaken off the idea
2016-04-13 20:51:57	@Espyo	we can probably make the wordings sound a bit more friendly while still sounding formal and organized
2016-04-13 20:51:58	Scruffy	True, but they might also care a lot less all the same
2016-04-13 20:52:05	Scruffy	That's a good point thoug
2016-04-13 20:52:20	@Espyo	I've got dinner; any more thoughts in the meantime?

2016-04-13 21:22:14	Scruffy	Testyo memo PikFan I think Amber's initial reaction is too strong; I would ease into the concern a little more. Then the paragraph about describing Ignis's thoughts ("He couldn't believe that a Pikmin...") is a bit stiff. You could benefit from shortening those sentences. Otherwise, good stuff!

2016-04-14 02:46:04	ScruffyChat	It falls under aichmophobia, but that's an umbrella term for a fear of all sharp things, including wall corners and pencils
2016-04-14 02:46:16	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-14 02:46:26	Neocraftz1553	Not scared of pencils, but...

2016-04-14 03:28:24	Neocraftz1553	If I were to die, I want to die quickly, painlessly, and fearlessly..
2016-04-14 03:28:36	Neocraftz1553	Or at least painlessly...
2016-04-14 03:28:46	Neocraftz1553	then I could think,
2016-04-14 03:29:10	Neocraftz1553	That was a good life, it's a shame it ended here...
2016-04-14 03:29:23	Neocraftz1553	a deep, disturbing thought...
2016-04-14 03:29:54	Neocraftz1553	many times I have been in those situations, and many times I miraculously came out of them...
2016-04-14 03:30:17	Neocraftz1553	hopefully my luck holds, or I never have to face situations like that again...
2016-04-14 03:31:00	Neocraftz1553	I don't think the above, though...
2016-04-14 03:31:11	Neocraftz1553	I think, Wow, it's over, I'm done...
2016-04-14 03:31:51	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry the thought comes over you
2016-04-14 03:32:09	Neocraftz1553	yup

2016-04-14 03:52:26	Neocraftz1553	*weight
2016-04-14 03:52:46	ScruffyChat	Ah

2016-04-14 03:53:05	ScruffyChat	Oh shoot, I have to go for now

2016-04-14 16:38:29	Neocraftz1553	Hello Yoshi2!
2016-04-14 16:38:39	Neocraftz1553	What would you tell Scruffy on his Birthday
2016-04-14 16:38:44	Neocraftz1553	http://pasteboard.co/bpDTdHF.png
2016-04-14 16:39:01	@PikFan	that's brilliant
2016-04-14 16:39:05	Neocraftz1553	I am making him a B-day card? Picture? I don't know, something like that
2016-04-14 16:40:04	Neocraftz1553	I would make one for you, but I don't know your birthday, Pikfan or Yoshi2...
2016-04-14 16:40:09	Neocraftz1553	may I ask?
2016-04-14 16:40:30	@PikFan	oh, my birthday already passed
2016-04-14 16:40:35	@PikFan	it was in January
2016-04-14 16:41:42	Neocraftz1553	oh...
2016-04-14 16:41:50	Neocraftz1553	Well, Happy late Birthday
2016-04-14 16:41:56	Yoshi2	I do silly bday cards for one of my friends and I usually just write "Herzlichen Glückwunsch zum XX. [Geburtstag]" and in some cases I add some silly text to it but that depends on how silly the card should be
2016-04-14 16:42:05	Neocraftz1553	I guess I'll start working on your card then, Pikfan
2016-04-14 16:42:15	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-14 16:42:20	@PikFan	oh, you don't have to...
2016-04-14 16:42:29	Neocraftz1553	Oh, but I will
2016-04-14 16:42:37	@PikFan	heh, if you insist
2016-04-14 16:42:59	Neocraftz1553	Yoshi2, your Birthday?
2016-04-14 16:43:20	Yoshi2	it was on the 3rd of april
2016-04-14 16:43:29	@PikFan	oml
2016-04-14 16:43:38	@PikFan	why do you not tell us these things
2016-04-14 16:43:43	@PikFan	well, happy late birthday
2016-04-14 16:43:50	Yoshi2	sorrey
2016-04-14 16:44:00	Yoshi2	thx
2016-04-14 16:44:03	@PikFan	(maybe you did, but I guess I wasn't here...?)
2016-04-14 16:44:25	Yoshi2	I probably didn't
2016-04-14 16:44:26	Neocraftz1553	Happy late birthday Yoshi2
2016-04-14 16:44:34	Yoshi2	thx

2016-04-14 16:45:03	Yoshi2	but happy late birthdays kinda aren't as good as happy birthdays

2016-04-14 17:05:46	Yoshi2	no idea, the most I did on my silly bday card for a friend of mine is "congratulations on your XXth birthday" and added some silly small text
2016-04-14 17:06:05	Neo	hmm...
2016-04-14 17:06:48	Neo	I guess I'll put "Congrats on your birthday!" -Yoshi2, or somethijg like that
2016-04-14 17:07:03	Yoshi2	but it sounds weird in english
2016-04-14 17:07:07	Yoshi2	sounds less weird in german
2016-04-14 17:07:19	Yoshi2	idk what other ways of wishing somebody a happy bday are in english
2016-04-14 17:07:22	Neo	true, but it's acceptable
2016-04-14 17:07:51	Neo	actually, you could put something in German, then I could try translating as best as I can...
2016-04-14 17:09:47	Yoshi2	you'll just run it through google translate anyway :p
2016-04-14 17:10:36	Neo	maybe...
2016-04-14 17:10:41	Yoshi2	ok, it works better if you know the age of the person
2016-04-14 17:10:55	Neo	but I do know... a little bit...
2016-04-14 17:10:56	Yoshi2	so it's like "Congratulations on your 20th birthday."
2016-04-14 17:11:02	Yoshi2	if somebody is 20 now
2016-04-14 17:11:20	Neo	Ok Scruffy around 17 years... I think...

2016-04-14 19:06:09	ScruffyChat	Espyo, I have some pretty interesting news
2016-04-14 19:06:27	ScruffyChat	I have for the most part figured out how to change the pitch material of cave music in Pikmin 2
2016-04-14 19:07:07	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-14 19:07:10	@Espyo	ooh, that's great!
2016-04-14 19:07:19	@Espyo	I want to know all about it
2016-04-14 19:07:29	ScruffyChat	I changed the E dorian pitches of the "Hole of Heroes" music entirely into E lydian-mixolydian, or otherwise minor to major
2016-04-14 19:07:49	ScruffyChat	So I opened up the file for the hole of heroes music, and was just browsing it
2016-04-14 19:08:08	ScruffyChat	When I found this pattern of ten bytes followed by d's
2016-04-14 19:08:25	ScruffyChat	And I knew there were ten notes to the repeating texture in the song
2016-04-14 19:08:50	ScruffyChat	So I changed them all to the value "E," and sure enough, in the game it ended up playing the same note over and over

2016-04-14 19:08:57	ScruffyChat	Not the note E though
2016-04-14 19:09:04	ScruffyChat	I think it was a G or something
2016-04-14 19:09:33	ScruffyChat	Anyway, after that I just looked up a hexadecimal chart for reference, and worked up chromatically until I knew which values represent which notes
2016-04-14 19:09:51	ScruffyChat	And now the whole song is in a happy sounding key
2016-04-14 19:10:38	ScruffyChat	Also I haphazardly changed a few other harmless-looking bytes and now when the bass gesture comes in, it loops indefinitely
2016-04-14 19:11:30	ScruffyChat	This was all in the .bms file, by the way, in the file Seq.arc in "Seqs" in "AudioRes"
2016-04-14 19:12:15	ScruffyChat	Then I changed a few more bytes in "Snow 1" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYpompND69k&list=PL8270A5CCBAE70F4B&index=34
2016-04-14 19:12:35	ScruffyChat	And now rather than wait a few beats to start a new four-note gesture, it does one every beat
2016-04-14 19:12:43	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-04-14 19:12:46	ScruffyChat	It makes it much more dissonant and dire, I love messing with it
2016-04-14 19:12:59	@Espyo	if you can only find exactly what parts of the file control this
2016-04-14 19:13:02	@Espyo	this would be a breakthrough
2016-04-14 19:13:08	@Espyo	Yoshi2 tried messing with those files loads
2016-04-14 19:13:14	@Espyo	but never really came up with any solid conclusion...
2016-04-14 19:13:40	ScruffyChat	I should upload the file and show what bytes I'm talking about, or something
2016-04-14 19:13:47	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-14 19:13:51	@Espyo	you and Yoshi2 should work together on this

2016-04-14 19:14:34	ScruffyChat	Also the order in which gestures are chosen is random, but it begins the same way every time
2016-04-14 19:14:57	ScruffyChat	Although perhaps if you left the cave and came back, it would pick up where the random order left off
2016-04-14 19:15:32	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-14 19:17:54	ScruffyChat	Okay here's something, one singular gesture is always preceded by the bytes "ƒ]"
2016-04-14 19:18:01	ScruffyChat	That's ƒ and ]
2016-04-14 19:18:21	@Espyo	eh, you're probably better off writing down their hex values

2016-04-14 19:24:48	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-14 19:25:22	ScruffyChat	I found out in "Tile 2" that some notes have modifiers on them
2016-04-14 19:25:23	Yoshi2	FF is the end of a track
2016-04-14 19:25:31	ScruffyChat	Ah okay

2016-04-14 19:51:30	Yoshi2	to my editor I added moving the level view by dragging the mouse across the view earlier today, I'm suprised it was so easy
2016-04-14 19:51:43	ScruffyChat	Nice!
2016-04-14 19:52:28	@Espyo	yeah, that's usually how it is
2016-04-14 19:52:30	@Espyo	you do it
2016-04-14 19:52:31	@Espyo	and
2016-04-14 19:52:36	@Espyo	sometimes... that's all there is to it
2016-04-14 19:52:36	Yoshi2	the basic idea is: 1) if user clicks the mouse, set dragging = True and set lastx = current x, lasty = current y 2) if user releases the mouse, set dragging = False
2016-04-14 19:52:39	@Espyo	specially on stuff like this
2016-04-14 19:52:43	@Espyo	yep
2016-04-14 19:53:21	Yoshi2	3) while moving the mouse, calculate current x - lastx and current y - lasty and move the screen by -deltax and -deltay
2016-04-14 19:54:01	Yoshi2	(because you want to move the screen in the opposite direction of the dragging, not in the direction of dragging)

2016-04-14 19:59:05	ScruffyChat	One note has a value of 37, meaning its decimal value is 55, meaning it is the A flat below middle C
2016-04-14 19:59:29	ScruffyChat	That's followed by 08, meaning it has a polyphonic ID of 8 (even though it only goes 1-7?)
2016-04-14 20:00:10	ScruffyChat	And then followed by 40, giving it a velocity of 64

2016-04-14 20:01:38	Yoshi2	the polyphonic ID thing did confuse me too
2016-04-14 20:02:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah, these all have IDs of 08, if they are IDs at all
2016-04-14 20:02:28	ScruffyChat	But they need an ID so that the note-off controller knows when to end them, I think
2016-04-14 20:04:00	ScruffyChat	and then 64 (100, d) seems to be their way of separating notes
2016-04-14 20:05:43	Yoshi2	there is a delay event thing

2016-04-14 20:09:36	ScruffyChat	I guess an ID of 08 would make sense if they just want the note to cut off at the next note, since there's no polyphony within one instrument
2016-04-14 20:09:57	Yoshi2	that
2016-04-14 20:10:04	Yoshi2	actually makes quite a lot of sense
2016-04-14 20:11:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-14 20:11:48	ScruffyChat	One thing I don't get is that this "d" value (64, 100) that comes right after notes should be the delay controller like you said, but the delay should be 80, not 64
2016-04-14 20:11:58	ScruffyChat	64 should count as a note
2016-04-14 20:12:37	Yoshi2	the delay can be anything
2016-04-14 20:14:11	Yoshi2	there is one delay command for delays up to 2⁸-1 (max of what can fit in a byte), and another one for delays up to 2¹⁶-1 (max of what can fit in two bytes

2016-04-14 20:17:43	Yoshi2	0x64 should be a note on
2016-04-14 20:18:12	Yoshi2	although there might have been unknown commands in between which threw you off
2016-04-14 20:18:26	ScruffyChat	True, that's probably what this is

2016-04-14 20:21:35	ScruffyChat	36 08 7F 64 3C is one note, before the pattern repeats: so it has a note value of 54 (F# below middle C), an ID of 08, and a velocity of 127, and then two mystery values

2016-04-14 20:22:04	Yoshi2	ScruffyChat: what file and offset?

2016-04-14 20:23:11	ScruffyChat	How do I write the offset?
2016-04-14 20:23:45	Yoshi2	if you are using a hex editor, the editor should show the offset on the side
2016-04-14 20:23:54	Yoshi2	or bottom
2016-04-14 20:24:02	ScruffyChat	offset 535
2016-04-14 20:24:11	Yoshi2	in decimal?
2016-04-14 20:24:50	ScruffyChat	Oh, yes, sorry

2016-04-14 20:28:03	@PikFan	my favorite part is at 1:01 when the piano slows down dramatically

2016-04-14 20:38:02	@Espyo	but those don't really go anywhere else, so it makes sense that they're exclusively there
2016-04-14 20:38:05	@Espyo	(category's wrong btw)
2016-04-14 20:38:28	@PikFan	huh
2016-04-14 20:38:39	@PikFan	what about [[Brittany's notes]] then
2016-04-14 20:38:40	Testyo	"Brittany's_notes" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Brittany's_notes
2016-04-14 20:38:46	ScruffyChat	Yoshi2: 3C 01 60 80 3C
2016-04-14 20:38:46	Testyo	3 C = 37.4 °F / 276.15 K
2016-04-14 20:38:50	@PikFan	those notes are on the fruit pages too
2016-04-14 20:38:54	ScruffyChat	Found this in new_02.bms
2016-04-14 20:39:04	@PikFan	but I guess it's short enough to keep
2016-04-14 20:39:08	Yoshi2	mmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-04-14 20:39:08	ScruffyChat	0x30D
2016-04-14 20:39:24	@Espyo	of course
2016-04-14 20:39:31	@Espyo	Olimar's Notes are also on their respective treasure pages
2016-04-14 20:39:33	ScruffyChat	Some notes in this instrument are held longer than others
2016-04-14 20:39:37	Yoshi2	ScruffyChat: wait, 0x80 is the delay event
2016-04-14 20:39:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-14 20:39:44	ScruffyChat	Weird, right?
2016-04-14 20:39:56	@PikFan	wait, are you insinuating that there's an article with all of Olimar's Notes
2016-04-14 20:39:59	@Espyo	I actually really hope you two can make some good progress today
2016-04-14 20:40:07	@Espyo	it sucks when you discuss stuff, reach some minor conclusions
2016-04-14 20:40:12	@Espyo	and then try to come back to it several months later
2016-04-14 20:40:16	@Espyo	...after you already forgot your conclusions
2016-04-14 20:40:18	Yoshi2	so that could be a note-on event with 3 bytes instead of 5, and a following delay event
2016-04-14 20:40:31	ScruffyChat	True
2016-04-14 20:40:35	@Espyo	PikFan: no, I'm just saying we have a category with all the notes, and each treasure's notes can also be found on the treasure's article
2016-04-14 20:40:40	@PikFan	Espyo, you've described my whole efforts to clean up Fanon in a nutshell
2016-04-14 20:40:55	@Espyo	same as Brittany's notes: we have a category with them, and each fruit also has the respective fruit's notes
2016-04-14 20:41:44	@PikFan	so... then why did I create [[Brittany's notes]]...
2016-04-14 20:41:44	Testyo	"Brittany's_notes" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Brittany's_notes
2016-04-14 20:42:08	@PikFan	eh, it's not hurting anyone
2016-04-14 20:42:10	@Espyo	well, we have an article on all "notes"-type things
2016-04-14 20:42:24	Yoshi2	ScruffyChat: with enough of these discoveries, I might start a new bms project just for pikmin 2
2016-04-14 20:42:29	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-14 20:42:32	@Espyo	and yes, we COULD add all Treasure Hoard journal notes on [[Olimar's journal]]
2016-04-14 20:42:32	Testyo	"Olimar's_journal" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Olimar's_journal
2016-04-14 20:42:35	@Espyo	...but
2016-04-14 20:42:36	@Espyo	you know
2016-04-14 20:42:40	@Espyo	 201+ of them and all
2016-04-14 20:42:55	@Espyo	it'd be nice to have a list, but I think it's just overkill
2016-04-14 20:43:03	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-04-14 20:43:17	Yoshi2	because my old bms project is a mess and doesn't handle pikmin2 well
2016-04-14 20:43:22	@PikFan	not to mention, we still have the untranslated Japanese versions
2016-04-14 20:43:25	@Espyo	yes
2016-04-14 20:43:30	ScruffyChat	Yoshi2: And one more really weird one
2016-04-14 20:43:35	ScruffyChat	4C 30 7F 64 00
2016-04-14 20:43:35	Testyo	4 C = 39.2 °F / 277.15 K
2016-04-14 20:43:36	@PikFan	hopefully I can translate those someday
2016-04-14 20:43:43	@PikFan	several years from now
2016-04-14 20:43:49	@PikFan	when I know a lot more Japanese
2016-04-14 20:43:56	ScruffyChat	Still in new_02.bms, at offset 0x3B8
2016-04-14 20:44:28	ScruffyChat	This one's weird because what should be its polyphony ID is a value 0x30
2016-04-14 20:44:47	ScruffyChat	In the game, this is a note in the melody that holds a long time until the next melodic gesture
2016-04-14 20:45:10	ScruffyChat	If I change that 30, the note acts *really* strange
2016-04-14 20:45:49	ScruffyChat	I changed it to 1 and it doesn't hold anymore, instead it does a fast dramatic pitch-shift from a high G to too low to hear
2016-04-14 20:46:15	ScruffyChat	Sorry, i meant I changed it to 0x31
2016-04-14 20:46:43	ScruffyChat	And then I changed it to, uhh, 0x65, I think?
2016-04-14 20:46:58	ScruffyChat	And it held a lot longer than usual, and sounded more like a cymbal crash than a note
2016-04-14 20:47:12	ScruffyChat	Probably something the MIDI controller didn't want to handle
2016-04-14 20:47:32	ScruffyChat	Anyway, that's a very volatile value and I don't know why it's larger than 0x08
2016-04-14 20:47:48	Yoshi2	hmmmmmmmmmm
2016-04-14 20:47:53	Yoshi2	maybe different note modes
2016-04-14 20:48:01	ScruffyChat	Ugh why Nintendo
2016-04-14 20:48:08	ScruffyChat	And this is only the way /caves/ are done
2016-04-14 20:48:23	ScruffyChat	areas and non-random music is completely different, from what I've seen so far
2016-04-14 20:48:30	ScruffyChat	are*
2016-04-14 20:48:39	Yoshi2	the main overworld areas are pretty bullcrap
2016-04-14 20:48:55	@Espyo	really?
2016-04-14 20:48:59	@Espyo	I'd figure the caves would be
2016-04-14 20:48:59	Yoshi2	because they don't define tracks the regular way using 0xC1 (I think)
2016-04-14 20:49:13	@Espyo	since it has data for when to cut to a new... bar? phrase?
2016-04-14 20:49:14	Yoshi2	caves are probably even more so
2016-04-14 20:49:18	@Espyo	plus what parts are random and not
2016-04-14 20:49:20	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-14 20:49:40	Yoshi2	main areas still have changing music when fighting monsters
2016-04-14 20:49:58	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-14 20:50:10	ScruffyChat	It's all accounted for on the one .bms file, somehow
2016-04-14 20:50:39	Yoshi2	and then there is the se.bms
2016-04-14 20:50:44	Yoshi2	and all hell breaks lose
2016-04-14 20:50:47	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-14 20:51:06	ScruffyChat	really? Sound effects bms?
2016-04-14 20:51:13	Yoshi2	probably
2016-04-14 20:51:19	ScruffyChat	Ugh
2016-04-14 20:51:54	Yoshi2	much bigger than the other files
2016-04-14 20:52:14	ScruffyChat	the fact that Valley of Repose music is under n_tutorial.bms and n_tutorial_1stday.bms is pretty interesting, since "n" could stand for "new"
2016-04-14 20:52:24	ScruffyChat	Meaning they planned different music originally
2016-04-14 20:52:47	Yoshi2	possibly
2016-04-14 20:54:36	@PikFan	gotta get back to class
2016-04-14 20:54:38	@PikFan	bye
2016-04-14 20:54:40	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@leii-917-27.shs.lane.edu) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-04-14 20:54:43	ScruffyChat	Bye
2016-04-14 20:55:06	Yoshi2	but even if it stands for new, it doesn't say much because you can always assume that some music was different in development
2016-04-14 20:55:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-14 21:03:15	ScruffyChat	Well in n_tutorial.bms I am seeing some notes with 3 IDs and then only the 0x64 after them
2016-04-14 21:03:43	ScruffyChat	Perhaps the fifth value in the cave files has something to do with how the notes are randomly selected?
2016-04-14 21:05:12	ScruffyChat	wait never mind, some of them due have 2 bytes after the note definition
2016-04-14 21:05:18	ScruffyChat	I have no clue what it means
2016-04-14 21:06:26	ScruffyChat	Wait wait wait sorry
2016-04-14 21:06:34	ScruffyChat	that was in se.bms, not n_tutorial.bms
2016-04-14 21:07:30	Yoshi2	frankly, I don't care what happens in se.bms ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-04-14 21:07:36	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-14 21:08:14	Yoshi2	until we figure it out for the regular music files, playing around with sound effects is pointless because those are even more difficult to figure out
2016-04-14 21:08:22	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-14 21:09:07	Yoshi2	even in sunshine, wind waker and pikmin 1 the sound effects file was unplayable due to using some odd commands
2016-04-14 21:09:26	Yoshi2	well, unplayable for my program
2016-04-14 21:10:12	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-14 21:10:37	UltraMario	sunshine has some neat unused music
2016-04-14 21:11:48	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@206.78.wr.nm) has joined #pikipedia
2016-04-14 21:11:50	Yoshi2	UltraMario: what unused music?
2016-04-14 21:11:57	Neocraftz1553	I AM BACK
2016-04-14 21:12:03	Neocraftz1553	Hello everyone!
2016-04-14 21:12:11	 *	UltraMario gets a link
2016-04-14 21:12:58	Yoshi2	I know sunshine had unused yoshi bongo sounds for some levels that don't have a yoshi, and iirc it had the e3 sunshine theme
2016-04-14 21:13:07	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-14 21:13:23	Neocraftz1553	oooh, we're talking about sunshine
2016-04-14 21:13:30	UltraMario	https://tcrf.net/Super_Mario_Sunshine/Unused_Audio
2016-04-14 21:13:44	Neocraftz1553	I liked the Yoshis in Sunshine, they could change color :o
2016-04-14 21:14:10	UltraMario	it was annoying how they died in water though
2016-04-14 21:14:18	UltraMario	especially in delfino plaza
2016-04-14 21:14:24	<--	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.hv.zp) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-04-14 21:14:26	Yoshi2	ah, it was the spaceworld theme
2016-04-14 21:14:31	Neocraftz1553	ah, true
2016-04-14 21:14:32	UltraMario	in that part where you have to get on the island
2016-04-14 21:14:37	UltraMario	and ride the boat
2016-04-14 21:14:38	Neocraftz1553	Yes, THAT part...
2016-04-14 21:14:39	-->	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.hv.zp) has joined #pikipedia
2016-04-14 21:14:41	UltraMario	ugh
2016-04-14 21:14:48	Neocraftz1553	ugh indeed
2016-04-14 21:15:02	ScruffyChat	I think I've found the part of n_tutorial.bms that selects what instruments play what
2016-04-14 21:15:20	UltraMario	the unused yoshi instrument ones are pretty nifty though
2016-04-14 21:15:33	UltraMario	i like the noki bay one
2016-04-14 21:15:47	UltraMario	although that's probably cuz i love noki bay's theme
2016-04-14 21:15:47	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-14 21:16:06	Neocraftz1553	I actually hope they do a Sunshine 2 for Wii U or NX
2016-04-14 21:16:09	Yoshi2	the noki bay theme is pretty cool
2016-04-14 21:16:14	Yoshi2	and I want a sunshine 2
2016-04-14 21:16:37	Neocraftz1553	^
2016-04-14 21:16:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that'd be great
2016-04-14 21:16:49	Neocraftz1553	That'd be VERY great
2016-04-14 21:17:10	Neocraftz1553	maybe now different color Yoshis have very noticeable change in stats and such
2016-04-14 21:17:24	@Espyo	a Mario with Sunshine's gameplay, Galaxy's art direction, and 64's level styles would be epic
2016-04-14 21:17:30	Neocraftz1553	like a glowing yellow yoshi (like in Galaxy or Galaxy 2)
2016-04-14 21:17:49	UltraMario	eh
2016-04-14 21:17:49	Neocraftz1553	Yes!!
2016-04-14 21:17:57	UltraMario	i dunno about a sunshine 2
2016-04-14 21:18:03	Neocraftz1553	 64's level Styles were awsome
2016-04-14 21:18:07	Yoshi2	you what um
2016-04-14 21:18:09	UltraMario	but i'd be down for a remake
2016-04-14 21:18:17	 *	Yoshi2 pushes UltraMario into a pool of goo
2016-04-14 21:18:32	UltraMario	i mean, we did have one 3d mario remade already
2016-04-14 21:18:32	UltraMario	HEY
2016-04-14 21:18:38	 *	UltraMario drowns
2016-04-14 21:18:39	UltraMario	;-
2016-04-14 21:18:40	UltraMario	;
2016-04-14 21:18:46	Yoshi2	die
2016-04-14 21:18:51	Yoshi2	for not wanting a sunshine 2
2016-04-14 21:19:02	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-14 21:19:02	UltraMario	rude
2016-04-14 21:19:12	UltraMario	i never said i didnt want one
2016-04-14 21:19:12	UltraMario	;w;
2016-04-14 21:19:22	Neocraftz1553	hehehehe
2016-04-14 21:19:24	Yoshi2	if you aren't with us then you are against us
2016-04-14 21:19:30	ScruffyChat	Just trying some code surgery
2016-04-14 21:19:32	UltraMario	i dunno, i think i want 3d mario to go in a new direction
2016-04-14 21:19:40	Yoshi2	and you said "i dunno about a sunshine 2" so you are against us
2016-04-14 21:19:44	UltraMario	pls
2016-04-14 21:19:50	ScruffyChat	If it works, two instruments in the Valley of Repose song will be swapped
2016-04-14 21:20:04	Neocraftz1553	in all seriousness though, a Sunshine 2 would be very Epic, with graphics the build upon Galaxy's graphics (UHD, anyone)
2016-04-14 21:20:18	Neocraftz1553	 64 level styles, except BIGGER
2016-04-14 21:20:25	Yoshi2	sunshine really got the vacation feeling right
2016-04-14 21:20:30	Neocraftz1553	and more mechanics
2016-04-14 21:20:41	Neocraftz1553	yup Yoshi2, it was unique to the mario series
2016-04-14 21:20:46	Neocraftz1553	Very unique
2016-04-14 21:21:07	ScruffyChat	IT WOOOOOOOORKED!!!!!!!!!!
2016-04-14 21:21:15	ScruffyChat	The harp is playing the top handbell part
2016-04-14 21:21:22	Yoshi2	nice
2016-04-14 21:21:25	UltraMario	i agree about that
2016-04-14 21:21:31	ScruffyChat	And the handbell is playing the harp part
2016-04-14 21:21:34	ScruffyChat	Oh it's so beautiful
2016-04-14 21:21:36	@Espyo	ooooooh!
2016-04-14 21:21:43	@Espyo	sweet, headway!
2016-04-14 21:21:43	UltraMario	i do like how it got those vacation vibes
2016-04-14 21:21:50	@Espyo	please, PLEASE document everything you find
2016-04-14 21:21:57	@Espyo	it'll suck so much if this gets lost
2016-04-14 21:22:01	UltraMario	i dont like how linear sunshine was though
2016-04-14 21:22:02	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2016-04-14 21:22:18	UltraMario	you couldnt even play missions out of order like you could in 64
2016-04-14 21:22:35	ScruffyChat	Okay, so like it says in the documentation, 0xA4 is what is used to select instrument programs
2016-04-14 21:22:36	UltraMario	you're forced to play them in the same order every playthrough
2016-04-14 21:23:04	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-04-14 21:23:07	ScruffyChat	n_tutorial.bms at /least/ does the kindness of presenting all those at the beginning of the file, with line breaks
2016-04-14 21:23:19	Yoshi2	UltraMario: at some point you have freedom on whether you want to play a mission from one world or another
2016-04-14 21:23:26	ScruffyChat	So I just switched two of the instrument IDs
2016-04-14 21:23:29	Neocraftz1553	if they made a Sunshine 2, I hope they make at least SOME levels optional
2016-04-14 21:23:46	Neocraftz1553	Anyone remember that phantom stingray?
2016-04-14 21:24:01	Neocraftz1553	The one that split into smaller ones when you sprayed it?
2016-04-14 21:24:04	Yoshi2	yes
2016-04-14 21:24:05	Neocraftz1553	ugh...
2016-04-14 21:24:11	ScruffyChat	And give Bowser's voice role to Kenny James where it belongs
2016-04-14 21:24:25	UltraMario	Yoshi2: yes, but you always have that freedom
2016-04-14 21:24:30	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-14 21:24:40	Neocraftz1553	I had SO much trouble with that enemy
2016-04-14 21:24:41	UltraMario	you can do that in 64 and galaxy as well
2016-04-14 21:24:48	UltraMario	also ugh
2016-04-14 21:24:54	UltraMario	fuck phanta manta
2016-04-14 21:24:55	Testyo	Hey, don't swear!
2016-04-14 21:24:56	ScruffyChat	Scott Burns did some fine grunts and snarls but I don't think he portrayed a good Bowser when he spoke plain english
2016-04-14 21:25:49	Neocraftz1553	UltraMario: yeah, hated that, so much
2016-04-14 21:25:59	Yoshi2	in sm64 I never really took advantage of being able to do one star before another, but it would be neat, yeah
2016-04-14 21:26:08	ScruffyChat	I loved having so much trouble with the Phanta Manta
2016-04-14 21:26:33	ScruffyChat	It was pretty scary for me the first time I encountered it
2016-04-14 21:26:34	UltraMario	i did sometimes
2016-04-14 21:26:37	Yoshi2	phanta is ez as hell, i don't get why you hate it
2016-04-14 21:26:43	UltraMario	wat
2016-04-14 21:26:45	UltraMario	>ez
2016-04-14 21:26:50	UltraMario	also
2016-04-14 21:26:51	Neocraftz1553	heh, I love Phanta Manta, but it is scary AF
2016-04-14 21:26:58	Neocraftz1553	the first encounter, anyways
2016-04-14 21:27:03	ScruffyChat	yeah, it's a love-fear relationship
2016-04-14 21:27:06	Neocraftz1553	then its just plain annoying
2016-04-14 21:27:08	ScruffyChat	Like with the Waterwraith
2016-04-14 21:27:16	UltraMario	for example, i always do the chain chomp's gate star in bob-omb battlefield first
2016-04-14 21:27:17	Neocraftz1553	once you fail 20+ times xD
2016-04-14 21:27:20	UltraMario	since it's so ez
2016-04-14 21:27:22	Neocraftz1553	*xd
2016-04-14 21:27:46	Neocraftz1553	I love its concept and design, but I hate it...
2016-04-14 21:27:56	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-14 21:29:07	Neocraftz1553	I hated when mario got electrified though, it was a shocking experience...
2016-04-14 21:29:13	UltraMario	hwh
2016-04-14 21:29:16	UltraMario	*heh
2016-04-14 21:29:20	ScruffyChat	hardy har har
2016-04-14 21:29:24	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-14 21:30:10	Neocraftz1553	No, but seriously, it immobilizes you for a little bit... I love electrocution like that(Legend of Zelda anyone?) but I hate that you can't move
2016-04-14 21:30:24	Neocraftz1553	Btw, LoZ WW is my fav
2016-04-14 21:33:02	UltraMario	same
2016-04-14 21:33:31	Neocraftz1553	hmm... if there was a new Sunshine, I would like it to be more dynamic... as if it wasn't dynamic enough
2016-04-14 21:34:10	ScruffyChat	Hmmm
2016-04-14 21:34:30	ScruffyChat	Well, instrument swapping works once, and then it goes back to the original layout
2016-04-14 21:34:48	ScruffyChat	Like, once it loops, the normal version returns
2016-04-14 21:34:52	Neocraftz1553	wait, what are you trying to do, Scruffy?
2016-04-14 21:35:04	ScruffyChat	And I don't know how it does that
2016-04-14 21:35:11	ScruffyChat	I'm hacking Pikmin 2 music
2016-04-14 21:35:43	Neocraftz1553	oooh, for your hack
2016-04-14 21:35:52	ScruffyChat	Well, just to try it really
2016-04-14 21:36:09	ScruffyChat	I don't know if I'm going to be able to complete that hack, it would really take a long time
2016-04-14 21:36:13	Neocraftz1553	Will you add in different Music?
2016-04-14 21:36:22	Neocraftz1553	oh...
2016-04-14 21:36:28	ScruffyChat	I can't add in different music, I can only change the music that's already there
2016-04-14 21:36:33	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-14 21:36:33	ScruffyChat	It's MIDI controlled
2016-04-14 21:36:37	Neocraftz1553	Oh
2016-04-14 21:36:40	Neocraftz1553	OOOH
2016-04-14 21:36:49	Neocraftz1553	so you can take out music then replace it?
2016-04-14 21:37:10	ScruffyChat	No, the structure has to stay the same
2016-04-14 21:37:30	ScruffyChat	I can probably change pitch material, and I can maybe change instruments, but not much else
2016-04-14 21:37:43	Yoshi2	you COULD add different music if you knew how to properly convert midi to bms, but that has only been proven to work with sunshine, not with pikmin 2
2016-04-14 21:38:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah, and now that we've discovered Pikmin 2 puts extra info on its notes, that might be even more of a pipe dream
2016-04-14 21:39:00	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see
2016-04-14 21:41:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah I don't get it
2016-04-14 21:42:16	ScruffyChat	It starts off correctly swapped and then once it loops, the instruments all go back to their normal roles
2016-04-14 21:44:23	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-14 21:44:32	Neocraftz1553	HRMMM....
2016-04-14 21:45:00	ScruffyChat	It seems this crafty file redefines instruments later one
2016-04-14 21:45:01	ScruffyChat	on*
2016-04-14 21:45:07	ScruffyChat	This is going to take more surgery
2016-04-14 21:45:13	Neocraftz1553	yup

2016-04-14 21:46:11	Neocraftz1553	don't the instruments change when you encounter an enemy?
2016-04-14 21:46:24	Neocraftz1553	then it loops back to the original instruments?

2016-04-14 23:19:16	ScruffyChat	So Espyo, I got the instrument swapping to work successfully
2016-04-14 23:19:37	@Espyo	oh, that's great!
2016-04-14 23:19:51	ScruffyChat	There's a byte that selects instrument programs in the music file, but it's present more than once for each instruemnt
2016-04-14 23:20:07	ScruffyChat	So if you want to change an instrument, you have to change every instance that it's called
2016-04-14 23:20:29	@Espyo	yikes
2016-04-14 23:20:49	ScruffyChat	In the Valley of Repose they're only called twice each though, so it's okay
2016-04-14 23:20:58	@Espyo	oh, at least
2016-04-14 23:21:36	ScruffyChat	The notes themselves are still a total mystery
2016-04-14 23:21:45	@Espyo	drat
2016-04-14 23:21:59	@Espyo	they're likely very convoluted
2016-04-14 23:22:08	@Espyo	who knows what kind of effects Pikmin 2 uses for them
2016-04-14 23:22:16	ScruffyChat	But Yoshi2 and I still broke a lot of ground today with that and the info about extra note information that Pikmin 2 seems to use
2016-04-14 23:22:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-14 23:22:20	@Espyo	could have values for the amount of vibrato to apply, as far as we know
2016-04-14 23:22:28	@Espyo	that's really excellent
2016-04-14 23:22:54	ScruffyChat	Thanks :D I feel really good about finally cracking those mysterious music files
2016-04-14 23:22:58	ScruffyChat	At least somewhat

2016-04-14 23:23:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-14 23:24:09	ScruffyChat	I don't think this is likely since every track seems to use different instrument banks, but it might be possible to tell one theme to use instruments from another
2016-04-14 23:24:22	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-14 23:24:27	@Espyo	at the very least swap instruments inside the same bank
2016-04-14 23:24:43	@Espyo	wait
2016-04-14 23:24:43	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I've successfully done that
2016-04-14 23:24:49	@Espyo	I didn't read that right
2016-04-14 23:24:51	@Espyo	right, right
2016-04-14 23:24:55	ScruffyChat	I've had the jingle bells play the harp part in the Valley of Repose

2016-04-14 23:53:32	En_Passant	I know what I want it to look like but not how to make it happen
2016-04-14 23:55:05	@Espyo	tell you what
2016-04-14 23:55:11	@Espyo	tomorrow, send me a sketch or something about how you want it
2016-04-14 23:55:20	@Espyo	and I can give you some pointers about what needs to be written where
2016-04-14 23:55:38	ScruffyChat	yeah, I wouldn't know how to implement web design code
2016-04-14 23:55:50	En_Passant	Okay. It's okay that it's on Wikia, right?
2016-04-14 23:56:02	@Espyo	errr...
2016-04-14 23:56:07	@Espyo	I mean, not because of wikia bias
2016-04-14 23:56:13	@Espyo	but actually because I think wikia limits most of its CSS and such
2016-04-14 23:56:16	@Espyo	so you might be limited
2016-04-14 23:56:19	@Espyo	but it might work fine
2016-04-14 23:56:39	@Espyo	I could've probably written those sentences better
2016-04-14 23:56:52	@Espyo	but I implemented SO much work for hazards on the engine, these past 4 hours

2016-04-15 00:14:00	@PikFan	I just HATE writing essays and analyzing things

2016-04-15 00:14:37	@PikFan	and again, I don't mind learning about it
2016-04-15 00:14:48	@PikFan	but I'll probably be doing research papers
2016-04-15 00:14:51	@PikFan	also not fun

2016-04-15 00:15:08	En_Passant	I didn't have a research paper in AP US
2016-04-15 00:15:16	@PikFan	whaaa?
2016-04-15 00:15:19	@PikFan	...lucky
2016-04-15 00:16:00	ScruffyChat	Woahoho that miitomo ad on their website gets a little existential toward the end
2016-04-15 00:16:24	@PikFan	and then there's a class called Career and Tech, in which I have to write a 6 to 10 page paper about a job shadow I'll have to do
2016-04-15 00:16:25	ScruffyChat	Seriously someone says "You'll begin to question the very meaning of life with every fiber of your body"
2016-04-15 00:16:32	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-15 00:16:40	ScruffyChat	"...or just post a picture:
2016-04-15 00:16:43	ScruffyChat	"*
2016-04-15 00:16:44	@PikFan	very philosophical for nintendo
2016-04-15 00:16:46	@PikFan	*Nintendo
2016-04-15 00:17:04	UltraMario	2deep4me
2016-04-15 00:17:05	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it was meant as a joke, but it really caught me off-guard
2016-04-15 00:17:17	@PikFan	and finally, I have to take 1 health and 1 PE class
2016-04-15 00:17:32	@PikFan	both of which will make me feel EXTREMELY self conscious about my body image
2016-04-15 00:17:40	ScruffyChat	Health?
2016-04-15 00:17:58	ScruffyChat	What is that about? Nutrition? Sex-ed?
2016-04-15 00:18:10	@PikFan	yeah
2016-04-15 00:18:14	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-15 00:18:28	@PikFan	there's a health class for freshmen that's like a broad introductory course
2016-04-15 00:18:31	@PikFan	but I didn't take it
2016-04-15 00:18:39	@PikFan	because I had other classes
2016-04-15 00:18:45	En_Passant	Online Health
2016-04-15 00:18:49	En_Passant	That class is a joke
2016-04-15 00:18:55	@PikFan	so I'll likely be taking a course about child development
2016-04-15 00:19:07	@PikFan	which actually won't be so bad
2016-04-15 00:19:15	@PikFan	probably
2016-04-15 00:19:34	@PikFan	but I still expect that I'll have to do research and stuff like that
2016-04-15 00:19:55	ScruffyChat	Child development research isn't too rough
2016-04-15 00:20:05	ScruffyChat	...I would imagine
2016-04-15 00:20:12	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-15 00:20:22	ScruffyChat	The closest thing I've taken is a psychology class
2016-04-15 00:20:36	@PikFan	the only classes I'm excited about are Algebra II and Japanese
2016-04-15 00:21:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah I enjoyed Algebra II
2016-04-15 00:21:51	ScruffyChat	Hyperbolae and all that
2016-04-15 00:22:11	En_Passant	I don't even remember what was in Algebra II, I had a shit teacher
2016-04-15 00:22:18	En_Passant	We skipped conics, that's all I know
2016-04-15 00:22:26	ScruffyChat	Heh yeah, hyperbolae is all I remember
2016-04-15 00:22:37	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-15 00:23:04	@PikFan	hey Scruffy, is Calculus hard?
2016-04-15 00:23:18	@PikFan	I have no idea what these "differential equations" are
2016-04-15 00:23:33	ScruffyChat	Not if you have a solid Pre-cal background and a teacher who cares about you understanding why concepts work
2016-04-15 00:23:43	ScruffyChat	ergo I'd wait til college to take it if you can
2016-04-15 00:24:04	@PikFan	ah, but you see
2016-04-15 00:24:22	@PikFan	I'd actually like to learn it soon
2016-04-15 00:24:47	@PikFan	like I'd like to be learning Algebra II right now
2016-04-15 00:24:55	En_Passant	Calc I is easy, Calc II is hard, Calc III is really Calc 3D
