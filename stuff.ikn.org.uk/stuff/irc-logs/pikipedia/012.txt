2015-02-08 19:35:23	Yoshi2	something I find to be odd is that the while loop has no real breakout statement when it successfully generates a merged sentence with a length >0
2015-02-08 19:36:06	Yoshi2	it just goes into the goto, and I have no idea what random_message_generated does, or contains

2015-02-08 19:42:23	Yoshi2	Espyo: does the split function just split the string at every whitespace, or does it detect several whitespaces in a row?
2015-02-08 19:42:39	@Espyo	every whitespace
2015-02-08 19:42:43	@Espyo	rather, every space space
2015-02-08 19:42:50	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-02-08 19:42:52	@Espyo	actually...
2015-02-08 19:43:02	@Espyo	I think it detects several in a row

2015-02-08 19:45:04	Yoshi2	if it splits at every space, it might say that an empty string is a word in the sentence, when that clearly shouldn't be the case
2015-02-08 19:48:49	Yoshi2	I wonder what the % operator does with strings
2015-02-08 19:49:11	Yoshi2	most of what I can find only talks about string formatting with %, but that is probably not it
2015-02-08 19:51:05	Yoshi2	if I had to guess, it returns true if the two strings are different, and false otherwise
2015-02-08 19:53:49	Yoshi2	the for loop in line 9,10 of http://pastebin.com/ypEMGeRa also has nothing that terminates the loop, which means that it will choose the last offsets for which the two sentences have different words
2015-02-08 19:54:16	Yoshi2	but, I am not sure how that can even work
2015-02-08 20:09:42	Yoshi2	hm, it can work if the operator here checks if two strings are the same
2015-02-08 20:10:44	Yoshi2	Espyo: help, what does % do in 'if(words1[w1] % words2[w2]) {'?
2015-02-08 20:11:06	@Espyo	overloaded operator
2015-02-08 20:11:08	@Espyo	I made it
2015-02-08 20:11:18	@Espyo	basically, if two strings equal, case insensitive

2015-02-08 20:11:52	Yoshi2	I see
2015-02-08 20:11:58	@Espyo	I use case-insensitive string comparison a lot, so I figured I should as well make it an operator
2015-02-08 20:12:15	Yoshi2	well, that confused me quite a bit, but it does make sense
2015-02-08 20:12:34	@Espyo	hehe
2015-02-08 20:13:07	Yoshi2	basically, this for loop checks the greatest offset for each of the two sentences so the words at these offsets are the same
2015-02-08 20:13:22	Yoshi2	so this word would be the "common word

2015-02-08 20:25:31	@Espyo	he just slams two messages together anywhere

2015-02-08 22:20:34	@PikFan	so what conclusion did you guys reach?
2015-02-08 22:20:59	@PikFan	kept disconnecting because stupid tablet is stupid
2015-02-08 22:21:23	@J	not sure there was one, really
2015-02-08 22:23:28	@PikFan	what is he going to do now?
2015-02-08 22:26:13	@Espyo	eh, he'll post up warnings everywhere telling people to use Pikipedia
2015-02-08 22:26:18	@Espyo	warn new users about Pikipedia as well
2015-02-08 22:26:23	@Espyo	and besides that, fix some typos
2015-02-08 22:26:32	@Espyo	it SHOULDN'T be enough to bring activity to wikia in high levels
2015-02-08 22:26:35	@Espyo	but we have to monitor it
2015-02-08 22:26:43	@Espyo	still sounds fishy to me
2015-02-08 22:26:54	@Espyo	why couldn't we have the warnings up and NOT have somebody be a janitor?
2015-02-08 22:27:00	@Espyo	if the warnings are up, the cleanup is moot
2015-02-08 22:27:02	@PikFan	hmm
2015-02-08 22:27:10	@Espyo	luckily, from his edits, he only half-knows what he's doing
2015-02-08 22:27:17	@Espyo	sometimes he destroys more than what he fixes
2015-02-08 22:27:20	@Espyo	so it'll end up the same
2015-02-08 22:27:29	@PikFan	so he's going to stay on Pikmin Wiki, I take it
2015-02-08 22:28:15	@Espyo	he'll still kind of be on Pikipedia
2015-02-08 22:29:22	@PikFan	hmm, alright

2015-02-08 22:54:46	UltraMario3DWorld	super mario 3d world is fun with a GC controller. <3
2015-02-08 22:54:58	UltraMario3DWorld	if you guys remember when i got the mayflash adapter, anyway
2015-02-08 22:55:25	UltraMario3DWorld	hey espyo, remember when windows ripped me off with that usb cd player nonsense? :P
2015-02-08 22:56:53	@Espyo	I think so
2015-02-08 22:56:54	@PikFan	wait you can play SM3DW with a GC adapter
2015-02-08 22:58:01	UltraMario3DWorld	no
2015-02-08 22:58:06	UltraMario3DWorld	i said Mayflash adapter
2015-02-08 22:58:18	UltraMario3DWorld	which is the one the company mayflash made before nintendo actually made their's
2015-02-08 22:58:29	UltraMario3DWorld	the official adapter is only for smash bros.
2015-02-08 22:58:47	UltraMario3DWorld	but this adapter is better in the fact that it works with any game that's classic controller compatible
2015-02-08 22:59:00	UltraMario3DWorld	i got this adapter on amazon
2015-02-08 22:59:13	UltraMario3DWorld	so i can play smash to the best of my ability again. ^_^
2015-02-08 23:00:15	@PikFan	oic
2015-02-08 23:00:40	@PikFan	yeah it's stupid that Nintendo made their official adapter work for ONLY Smash
2015-02-08 23:00:48	@PikFan	what kind of idiocy is that
2015-02-08 23:00:58	UltraMario3DWorld	well i mean, idk
2015-02-08 23:01:01	@PikFan	they're making a lot of poor decisions left and right
2015-02-08 23:01:07	UltraMario3DWorld	yeah but
2015-02-08 23:01:10	UltraMario3DWorld	they're still awesome
2015-02-08 23:01:17	UltraMario3DWorld	i can't wait to get a new 3ds
2015-02-08 23:01:19	UltraMario3DWorld	:D
2015-02-08 23:01:38	@PikFan	not as awesome as they used to be
2015-02-08 23:02:12	@PikFan	if they delay Zelda I will murder Miyamoto
2015-02-08 23:02:39	@PikFan	but knowing Nintendo they'll probably have to
2015-02-08 23:02:46	@PikFan	because they're stupid
2015-02-08 23:02:47	UltraMario3DWorld	>Zelda 1
2015-02-08 23:02:49	UltraMario3DWorld	what
2015-02-08 23:02:56	UltraMario3DWorld	also that's pretty rude
2015-02-08 23:03:15	UltraMario3DWorld	and stop being in your nostalgia goggles, nintendo is still awesome today
2015-02-08 23:03:17	UltraMario3DWorld	:P
2015-02-08 23:03:25	UltraMario3DWorld	don't kill someone just because they did something
2015-02-08 23:03:34	@PikFan	I was joking
2015-02-08 23:03:38	UltraMario3DWorld	i'm so hyped for the better hardware + better 3D
2015-02-08 23:03:47	UltraMario3DWorld	well if you're joking at least put a :P or something
2015-02-08 23:03:58	UltraMario3DWorld	sometimes it's hard to tell if you're joking or not just through text
2015-02-08 23:04:07	@PikFan	I understand that
2015-02-08 23:04:21	@PikFan	but come on, I wouldn't murder him, he's amazing
2015-02-08 23:05:22	UltraMario3DWorld	damn
2015-02-08 23:05:31	UltraMario3DWorld	is there anyway to change controlls on this
2015-02-08 23:05:45	UltraMario3DWorld	i mean in 3d world

2015-02-09 22:53:07	Testyo	why hi
2015-02-09 22:53:07	Testyo	hm, yeah
2015-02-09 22:53:09	@J	it wasn't a memo
2015-02-09 22:53:14	@J	I thought you saw everything Testyo saw
2015-02-09 22:53:15	Testyo	okay, I was overcomplicating
2015-02-09 22:53:29	@Espyo	I did, but only if I want to
2015-02-09 22:53:39	@Espyo	anyway, Codelite's just an IDE
2015-02-09 22:53:51	@Espyo	and apparently a LOT of things just blow up if /tmp isn't writeable
2015-02-09 22:54:07	@Espyo	so it might not be just because /tmp was gone, but more because it wasn't writable
2015-02-09 22:54:11	@Espyo	yeah, I'm not sure how that makes sense
2015-02-09 22:54:28	@Espyo	I think Codelite's installation removed the /tmp folder, placed its own things, and made it write-protected
2015-02-09 22:54:30	@Espyo	somehow
2015-02-09 22:54:36	@Espyo	but it did do it more than once
2015-02-09 22:54:42	@Espyo	I tried reinstalling
2015-02-09 22:59:12	@J	hmm, I see
2015-02-09 22:59:21	@J	yeah, things will go wrong if you can't write to /tmp
2015-02-09 22:59:39	@Espyo	it was pretty scary
2015-02-09 22:59:53	@J	in some distributions /tmp isn't an actual folder, it's a mount point, sometimes a separate partition, sometimes in-memory
2015-02-09 23:00:10	@Espyo	hmm
2015-02-09 23:00:21	@J	in others, it's an actual folder - provided by a package, usually, so fixing is best done by reinstalling the package
2015-02-09 23:00:40	@Espyo	right
2015-02-09 23:01:26	@J	I expect systemd does stuff with /tmp nowadays (like make it a service), so it's probably less likely to break like that with more modern releases

2015-02-10 22:29:56	@Espyo	oh, okay
2015-02-10 22:30:12	Kirbyddd	I was wondering if there are any Pikmin Wiki admins here.

2015-02-10 22:30:31	@Espyo	well, we were all Pikmin Wiki users before going to Pikipedia
2015-02-10 22:30:41	@Espyo	but what do you need an admin for?
2015-02-10 22:30:49	@J	to become admin, I suspect
2015-02-10 22:35:13	@J	oh, but yeah, I'm still a bureaucrat there

2015-02-10 22:47:07	@Espyo	here's hoping
2015-02-10 22:47:24	Kirbyddd	Did you get my last message?

2015-02-10 22:47:43	Kirbyddd	Ok
2015-02-10 22:47:52	Kirbyddd	Just a second.
2015-02-10 22:50:36	Kirbyddd	Someone has been vandalizing the Pikmin Wiki.  Their accounts get blocked but they make more, and I know it's the same person because they upload the same pictures.  I was wondering if anyone here could block their IP.
2015-02-10 22:54:59	Kirbyddd	Hello?

2015-02-10 22:55:37	@Espyo	check their page
2015-02-10 22:55:41	@Espyo	they've been banned all across wikia
2015-02-10 22:55:53	@Espyo	apparently they've vandalized a staggering SEVENTY wikis with random images like that
2015-02-10 22:56:00	@Espyo	spammer or not, that's impressive as hell
2015-02-10 22:58:19	Kirbyddd	Wow.  They also weren't just random pictures, each one was related to the topic, and some were photoshopped on to preexisting pictures.  Anyways, thanks.
2015-02-10 22:58:35	@Espyo	yeah, that's some really incredible dedication
2015-02-10 22:58:37	@Espyo	and no worries

2015-02-11 20:40:39	@PikFan	so for P3 images, should we have a guideline about how to take them? because in the images, their interfaces aren't always consistent

2015-02-11 20:50:26	@PikFan	I don't know why
2015-02-11 20:50:33	Yoshi2	considering that the gamepad shows a downscalled picture for the most part, I'd go with the higher resolution one

2015-02-11 20:56:49	@PikFan	okay, gotta go, bye
2015-02-11 20:57:00	Yoshi2	of course, but I'd say that, unless the game renders to the gamepad's resolution natively, taking a screenshot of the gamepad only serves to degrade the quality as the game's native resolution is higher than the gamepad's resolution

2015-02-11 21:01:24	Yoshi2	I don't think so
2015-02-11 21:02:12	@J	point is, who cares if it degrades quality
2015-02-11 21:02:19	@J	you just ask if it's sufficient
2015-02-11 21:02:19	Yoshi2	if this was a PC game that had a lot of options for the resolution, I'd agree with going with choosing the resolution that is the lowest but also shows the most
2015-02-11 21:02:21	@J	answer is yes
2015-02-11 21:04:03	-->	RingtailedFox (FoxFoxFox@p57-35-8-400.home.cgocable.net) has joined #pikipedia
2015-02-11 21:04:05	Yoshi2	but in case of, e.g., Pikmin 3, we have one native resolution and one resolution that just downscales the higher resolution picture
2015-02-11 21:04:19	Yoshi2	and in my opinion, blurry pictures aren't very nice to look at
2015-02-11 21:04:44	@J	that image is larger than any Pikmin 2 image
2015-02-11 21:05:21	@Espyo	imo, if one or two images are sub-optimal res, I won't really care
2015-02-11 21:05:41	@Espyo	but if we had the most of them 300x100 because that's enough to fit the content in a comfortable size, that'd be dumb
2015-02-11 21:06:59	@J	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Pikmin_2_Case.jpg example: full resolution of Wikipedia's Pikmin 2 box
2015-02-11 21:07:09	@J	you can't really complain with that quality
2015-02-11 21:07:19	@J	but there are certainly 2000px or so scans out there
2015-02-11 21:08:04	@Espyo	yeah, but like, unless there are technical problems, we don't have a reason to not use the best quality possible
2015-02-11 21:08:16	@Espyo	there ARE some technical problems, though
2015-02-11 21:08:18	@J	we do
2015-02-11 21:08:19	@Espyo	space and bandwidth
2015-02-11 21:08:23	@J	copyright
2015-02-11 21:08:36	@Espyo	I don't think that sounds right
2015-02-11 21:08:54	Yoshi2	in the case of the two pikmin 3 pictures from above, the gamepad picture is around 100 kB smaller than the native resolution one
2015-02-11 21:10:58	@J	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content#Image_resolution
2015-02-11 21:13:32	@Espyo	yeah, but, to what point are screenshots copyrighted material?
2015-02-11 21:13:42	@Espyo	isn't this going a bit too insanely crazy?
2015-02-11 21:14:22	Yoshi2	if there is a legal reason to use a specific resolution, it would be hard to argue against that

2015-02-11 21:15:02	Yoshi2	but from a technical point of view, not much is gained from using the gamepad screenshot versus using the TV screenshot, as far as I can tell
2015-02-11 21:16:44	Yoshi2	unless you are fine with saving around 100 kB per screenshot per view at the cost of having a picture with roughly 1/2 the pixel count
2015-02-11 21:19:47	@J	the smaller image is a more complex one
2015-02-11 21:20:21	Yoshi2	indeed

2015-02-11 22:39:59	@J	then I realised I had a debugging thing enabled
2015-02-11 22:40:12	@J	which makes all calls to a very common library slower

2015-02-12 20:33:06	@Espyo	windows shenanigan of the day: I installed a new version of visual studio yesterday
2015-02-12 20:33:10	@Espyo	today, I opened a .cpp file
2015-02-12 20:33:18	@Espyo	my default program to open .cpp files with was Notepad++
2015-02-12 20:33:30	@Espyo	windows detected that there was a new program that could open these files, visual studio
2015-02-12 20:33:34	@Espyo	it asked me which one to use
2015-02-12 20:33:54	@Espyo	I picked Notepad++, still
2015-02-12 20:34:05	@Espyo	...it not only disregarded my choice, but forgot my previous choice too
2015-02-12 20:34:22	@Espyo	I couldn't open .cpp files again until I chose the "open with..." option again, and THEN tell it I want Notepad++
2015-02-12 20:37:23	Yoshi2	I remember how on my old computer with win2k visual studio (or some sort of it) was set as the default program for a lot of random file extensions

2015-02-12 20:39:26	Yoshi2	I am not sure if VS was that program, but its icon in the splash screen was a colorful 8 lying on its side, I think
2015-02-12 20:41:58	@Espyo	that's visual studio
2015-02-12 20:42:03	@Espyo	probably the same version I have now
2015-02-12 20:42:22	@Espyo	also, it didn't create a start menu or metro menu shortcut
2015-02-12 20:42:38	@Espyo	so I had to take a lucky guess and run a random .exe from the labyrinthine folders
2015-02-12 20:42:52	@Espyo	I hope this is worth it, else I'll just stick with the old version I have...

2015-02-13 20:07:08	@J	how are the exams going, Yoshi2?
2015-02-13 20:07:23	Yoshi2	not good
2015-02-13 20:09:26	@J	finding it hard?
2015-02-13 20:09:34	@J	these are you first university exams, I guess?
2015-02-13 20:09:45	Yoshi2	yup
2015-02-13 20:10:36	@J	fortunately I only had two after Christmas in my first year - yeah, it's definitely a step up from anything you've done before
2015-02-13 20:10:47	@J	how many do you have left?
2015-02-13 20:11:34	Yoshi2	three exams
2015-02-13 20:11:59	@J	okay, well good luck with those, hope they go better
2015-02-13 20:12:10	@J	do these count much towards your final grade (if at all)?
2015-02-13 20:12:50	Yoshi2	I have not given the final grades any thought
2015-02-13 20:12:52	@J	I think my first year was 10%, so each exam would probably be 0.5-1.5% in that year
2015-02-13 20:13:11	@J	but some universities don't count the first year at all
2015-02-13 20:13:19	@J	and Germany is probably different anyway
2015-02-13 20:13:23	@J	just wondering
2015-02-13 20:14:24	Yoshi2	I'd already be happy if I passed the exams
2015-02-13 20:15:35	Yoshi2	I really wish my first exam wasn't in maths, that is the worst subject of all the subjects
2015-02-13 20:15:47	@J	lying so much
2015-02-13 20:16:10	Yoshi2	*of all the subjects I have right now
2015-02-13 20:16:19	Yoshi2	who knows what will come in the future
2015-02-13 20:16:30	@J	maths is great

2015-02-14 14:46:06	Yoshi2	6 minutes
2015-02-14 14:46:08	Yoshi2	quick enough
2015-02-14 14:47:19	Yoshi2	Testyo: fortune

2015-02-14 14:47:25	Yoshi2	well, alright
2015-02-14 14:50:56	@J	not really
2015-02-14 14:54:04	Yoshi2	if it involves updates, it can take more time
2015-02-14 14:54:09	Yoshi2	in which case 6 minutes is alright
2015-02-14 14:57:17	@J	sad

2015-02-14 14:59:14	@Espyo	oh, I went to have lunch in the meantime
2015-02-14 14:59:25	@Espyo	still, 6 minutes is pretty much the average time for my PC to reboot on
2015-02-14 14:59:56	@J	do you have an SSD?
2015-02-14 15:00:07	@Espyo	nope
2015-02-14 15:00:10	Yoshi2	with a reboot time of 6 minutes, quite unlikely
2015-02-14 15:00:20	@J	you never know
2015-02-14 15:00:37	@J	I thought Windows 8 was meant to have some thing where it doesn't really reboot, which makes it faster or something?
2015-02-14 15:00:49	Yoshi2	no idea
2015-02-14 15:01:05	Yoshi2	it probably has something that reduces boot up time
2015-02-14 15:01:48	Yoshi2	whatever it is, this notebook boots up very quickly
2015-02-14 15:04:54	@Espyo	it does
2015-02-14 15:04:57	@Espyo	and that is enabled
2015-02-14 15:09:57	@Espyo	ok, we need to discuss linguistics
2015-02-14 15:10:21	@Espyo	>This rare species of bulborb has a certain indefatigability.
2015-02-14 15:10:31	@Espyo	that's the enemy reel note for the Spotty Bulbear
2015-02-14 15:10:42	@Espyo	which lead to this trivia point
2015-02-14 15:10:46	@Espyo	>Also in the enemy reel, it says that the enemy has a certain indefatigability (meaning it's seemingly incapable of being tired), which is strange, since the only thing related to fatigue that is relevant to the enemy is the revival mechanic, but that was only introduced in Pikmin 2.
2015-02-14 15:10:53	@Espyo	today I wondered
2015-02-14 15:10:57	@Espyo	this makes no sense
2015-02-14 15:11:11	Yoshi2	I never ever heard of indefatigability
2015-02-14 15:11:12	@Espyo	so let's see here, "fatigability" is when you grow tired
2015-02-14 15:11:24	@Espyo	so the opposite would be INfatigability, or DEfatigability, right?
2015-02-14 15:11:31	@Espyo	but INDEfatigability?
2015-02-14 15:11:35	@Espyo	is this a double negative?
2015-02-14 15:11:46	@J	it's just a word
2015-02-14 15:11:48	@Espyo	is it a possible alternate to either IN or DE?
2015-02-14 15:11:49	@J	no-one cares
2015-02-14 15:11:55	@Espyo	of course everybody cares
2015-02-14 15:12:35	@Espyo	I've tried googling around for the opposite of "fatigability"
2015-02-14 15:12:38	@Espyo	...no results
2015-02-14 15:12:59	@J	that's because the base word is 'defatigable'
2015-02-14 15:13:30	Yoshi2	well, the monster word appears so exist
2015-02-14 15:13:35	Yoshi2	http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/de/definition/englisch/indefatigable
2015-02-14 15:13:43	@J	I guess the 'de' somehow adds the connotation of 'making' it tired
2015-02-14 15:13:49	@J	as opposed to it becoming tired itself
2015-02-14 15:14:08	@Espyo	what a mess...
2015-02-14 15:14:11	@Espyo	but I guess it adds up
2015-02-14 15:14:14	@J	so indefatigable is not being able to make it tired
2015-02-14 15:14:20	Yoshi2	"early 17th century: from French, or from Latin indefatigabilis, from in- 'not' + de- 'away, completely' + fatigare 'wear out'."
2015-02-14 15:14:22	@J	like 'unstoppable'
2015-02-14 15:14:31	@Espyo	right
2015-02-14 15:14:41	Yoshi2	so "in" and "de" are not the same
2015-02-14 15:15:07	Yoshi2	but here is my suggestion:
2015-02-14 15:15:23	Yoshi2	how about we replace that with "the enemy is incapable of becoming tired"
2015-02-14 15:16:14	@J	it's not quite the same
2015-02-14 15:16:19	@J	you've lost the 'de'
2015-02-14 15:17:13	Yoshi2	hrm
2015-02-14 15:17:15	Yoshi2	fair enough
2015-02-14 15:17:15	@J	probably too subtle to matter though
2015-02-14 15:18:07	@J	why are we suddenly dictionarywiki anyway?
2015-02-14 15:18:29	@J	why have the definition on the page?
2015-02-14 15:21:23	@Espyo	we... can't replace it
2015-02-14 15:21:31	@Espyo	that's the words from the enemy reel notes

2015-02-14 15:25:38	@J	anyway, I stand by my question as to why we even have the definition in brackets
2015-02-14 15:26:31	@J	Miles_: I can see why you might say that, but I don't think it's as likely if this is something translated from Japanese
2015-02-14 15:27:05	@J	at least the translator wouldn't be translating a phrase that doesn't really mean anything, I don't think
2015-02-14 15:28:06	Miles_	I mean, I don't think it's "strange" like the wiki says there
2015-02-14 15:28:23	Miles_	It's just a random line, it doesn't have to match up with an actual game mechanic
2015-02-14 15:29:01	@Espyo	agreed

2015-02-14 15:31:02	@J	and of course it misses the whole part where they chase you more agressively than Bulborbs
2015-02-14 15:31:33	@J	...I think; I just realised it's been years since I played
2015-02-14 15:32:12	@Espyo	"agressively"
2015-02-14 15:32:21	@Espyo	(I didn't mean to point out the typo, but typo still)
2015-02-14 15:32:36	@Espyo	what could you mean with that? chases for longer? faster? angrier feet stamps?
2015-02-14 15:33:43	@J	longer is what I was thinking, I guess, but I guess I was really thinking about how you see them not sleeping in Pikmin 2
2015-02-14 15:33:56	@J	I bet that makes sense
2015-02-14 15:34:13	@Espyo	makes full sense, I was thinking the same
2015-02-14 15:34:21	@Espyo	I'd have to actually play to check if they chase you for longer in P1
2015-02-14 15:35:41	@J	plus there's something that makes them harder to beat (more HP?  Eat Pikmin quicker?)
2015-02-14 15:35:55	@Espyo	I know they eat more Pikmin
2015-02-14 15:35:59	@Espyo	probably more HP too
2015-02-14 15:40:37	@J	so yeah, I think conclusion is to scrap the comment

2015-02-16 19:02:57	Yoshi2_	Testyo: lm
2015-02-16 19:02:57	Testyo	I said I now know espyo's secret because Espyo mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages I have no idea and i now know espyo's secret. They were joined by the common word I.
2015-02-16 19:03:16	Yoshi2_	that means there IS a secret
2015-02-16 19:06:01	@Espyo	he could be bluffing, though
2015-02-16 19:08:44	Yoshi2_	Testyo: are you bluffing? (y/n)
2015-02-16 19:08:44	Testyo	Seems like it.
2015-02-16 19:08:58	Yoshi2_	well, that settles it, I guess
2015-02-16 21:27:50	@Espyo	hey, remember that Bumblebee glitch?
2015-02-16 21:27:52	@Espyo	https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671
2015-02-16 21:28:00	@Espyo	Valve's doing something similar too
2015-02-16 21:51:33	Yoshi2_	wasn't that the same link you (or somebody else) showed when the bumblebee glitch came up?
2015-02-16 21:55:39	@J	...yeah
2015-02-16 21:58:24	@Espyo	couldn't have been
2015-02-16 21:58:33	@Espyo	I know I used a Google Search and found something non-Bumblebee
2015-02-16 21:58:48	@Espyo	but I don't think it was Valve
2015-02-16 21:59:01	@J	don't make me look it up
2015-02-16 21:59:05	Yoshi2_	I do remember seeing that steam linux issue
2015-02-16 21:59:16	Yoshi2_	maybe it was in a different context
2015-02-16 21:59:20	@Espyo	well then I have dementia
2015-02-16 21:59:46	Yoshi2_	poor Espyo 
2015-02-16 22:00:19	@Espyo	expect me to repost it in a week and a half, though
2015-02-16 22:01:46	Yoshi2_	well
2015-02-16 22:02:51	Yoshi2_	apparently I have some sort of mentall illness that causes me to see things that never happened
2015-02-16 22:03:07	Yoshi2_	*mental
2015-02-16 22:03:34	Yoshi2_	that link never appeared on this channel, I guess I saw it somewhere else
2015-02-16 22:03:37	@Espyo	wait, so does that mean I never posted?
2015-02-16 22:03:42	@Espyo	J led you in error
2015-02-16 22:03:56	Yoshi2_	that means you likely never posted that link here, at least not while I was online
2015-02-16 22:04:42	@J	2015-02-01 15:37:20     Yoshi2  good point testy o, even if nintendo cares, all that counts is that we never added obstacle plants before

2015-02-16 22:19:09	@PikFan	the other Pikmin types don't have icons?
2015-02-16 22:19:59	@Espyo	nope
2015-02-16 22:20:03	@Espyo	they were never needed
2015-02-16 22:20:11	@Espyo	plus the icon for Reds is pretty iffy as-is
2015-02-16 22:20:35	@Espyo	also, the Smash 4 trophy for the Hocotate Bomb (Hocotate ship as an item) states it comes from P1 and P2
2015-02-16 22:20:37	@Espyo	good grief
2015-02-16 22:21:02	@PikFan	yay for inconsistencies
2015-02-16 22:22:10	@PikFan	the icon for Reds looks fine
2015-02-16 22:22:39	@Espyo	I don't think it looks bad, but it's so...
2015-02-16 22:22:50	@Espyo	"grab the concept art, crop it and give it a border"-like
2015-02-16 22:22:58	@Espyo	...which is what I did for most of the other custom icons anyway...
2015-02-16 22:23:25	@PikFan	heh
2015-02-16 22:23:39	@PikFan	you'd probably kill yourself if you tried to make original icons
2015-02-16 22:23:50	@PikFan	for every single icon
2015-02-16 22:24:05	@Espyo	mhm
2015-02-16 22:24:06	@PikFan	easily 300 icons
2015-02-16 22:24:53	@PikFan	oh, also, didn't you consider merging the obstacle icons with the icon template at some point?
2015-02-16 22:25:08	@PikFan	I'm not asking you to, just want to know if that ever happened
2015-02-16 22:25:32	@Espyo	don't think I did
2015-02-16 22:25:39	@Espyo	but they shouldn't need such a thing
2015-02-16 22:25:42	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2015-02-16 22:25:49	@Espyo	if the files are already called "<obstacle> icon.png", then it's done
2015-02-16 22:38:18	@PikFan	...oh, lovely
2015-02-16 22:38:29	@PikFan	so I'm adding icons to the fruits
2015-02-16 22:38:38	@PikFan	but their widths are inconsistent
2015-02-16 22:40:47	@PikFan	well, I suppose it'll have to do
2015-02-16 22:40:58	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-02-16 22:41:04	@Espyo	I'll have to make them consistent
2015-02-16 22:42:03	@PikFan	a list where a Face Wrinkler is tiny so that its width is the same as a Cupid's Grenade? inconceivable
2015-02-16 22:42:23	@PikFan	that'd look even worse than what it does now
2015-02-16 22:42:59	@PikFan	...oh
2015-02-16 22:43:13	@PikFan	I see...
2015-02-16 22:44:41	@PikFan	was an icon for Nuggets made?
2015-02-16 22:45:47	@Espyo	I never said do it like that though
2015-02-16 22:45:50	@Espyo	anyway, no Nuggets yet
2015-02-16 22:47:36	@PikFan	alright
2015-02-16 22:47:48	@PikFan	I'll leave the icon there anyway
2015-02-16 22:48:16	@Espyo	mhm
2015-02-16 22:53:00	@PikFan	in lists, should obstacles be called "Dirt Wall" or "dirt wall"?
2015-02-16 22:53:47	@PikFan	the former seems to make more sense, but...
2015-02-16 22:59:58	@Espyo	dirt wall
2015-02-16 22:59:59	@Espyo	policy
2015-02-16 23:03:20	@PikFan	I know that "dirt wall" is policy, but "Dirt Wall" looks better in a list
2015-02-16 23:04:16	@PikFan	at least, I think it does
2015-02-16 23:31:16	@PikFan	"The Climbing Stick used to obtain the Nugget pile is also behind the player at the start of the level, allowing players to gain some quick funds."
2015-02-16 23:31:25	@PikFan	iirc there is no climbing stick in that level

2015-02-17 15:22:02	@Espyo	kinda pointless poll
2015-02-17 15:29:25	Yoshi2_	I vote "Who is Steve?"
2015-02-17 15:29:41	@Espyo	heh
2015-02-17 15:29:45	@Espyo	long story short...
2015-02-17 15:29:53	@Espyo	Chuggaconroy is a Let's Player, a popular one at that
2015-02-17 15:30:17	@Espyo	in one of his Pikmin (or Pikmin 2) LP's, one Red Pikmin randomly decided to fight an enemy without the player's consent
2015-02-17 15:30:36	@Espyo	Chugga jokingly "honored" the Pikmin, calling him "Steve" and saying that "he's a real trooper"
2015-02-17 15:30:36	@Espyo	well
2015-02-17 15:30:40	@Espyo	for SOME reason
2015-02-17 15:30:45	@Espyo	a lot of people went INSANE over it
2015-02-17 15:30:46	@Espyo	like
2015-02-17 15:30:49	@Espyo	they saw Steve as a messiah
2015-02-17 15:31:07	@Espyo	they even created pages on Pikipedia (on wikia still, at the time), and we had to keep deleting them
2015-02-17 15:31:13	@Espyo	it was out of this world
2015-02-17 15:34:03	Yoshi2_	very odd
2015-02-17 15:36:01	@Espyo	I know Chugga's influential, but...
2015-02-17 15:37:30	Yoshi2_	well, random things can suddenly become very popular 
2015-02-17 15:38:40	Yoshi2_	I've seen that somebody at one point edited the wikipedia page about the keyboard by replacing all mentions of "keyboard" with "leopard"
2015-02-17 15:39:20	@Espyo	heh
2015-02-17 15:39:22	Yoshi2_	because a xkcd comic referenced a browser thingy that would replace keyboard with leopard
2015-02-17 15:40:03	Yoshi2_	jokes are fun and dandy, but please keep those off websites that seek to provide correct information
2015-02-17 15:43:03	@Espyo	ah
2015-02-17 15:43:19	@Espyo	granted, the joke would be caught fairly early
2015-02-17 15:43:25	@Espyo	I don't think it was meant to be destructive
2015-02-17 15:43:40	@Espyo	just to be a "what if this thing in the comic was real?" and to make people giggle
2015-02-17 15:43:47	@Espyo	I'm betting it was reverted after just a few minutes
2015-02-17 15:50:37	Yoshi2_	yeah, it was reverted after less than 10 minutes
2015-02-17 15:52:29	@Espyo	mhm

2015-02-18 19:22:39	@Espyo	my chatlog is still adjusting the name column to fit his name, because he's still on the chatlog
2015-02-18 19:23:54	Yoshi2	when I was on chatzilla, the client tried to do that
2015-02-18 19:24:40	Yoshi2	hexchat seems to keep the name column at the width I set it at, it eats the time stamp if the name is too long though

2015-02-19 20:18:58	@PikFan	well, their page names, anyway
2015-02-19 20:19:27	@Espyo	just following the policy
2015-02-19 20:19:50	@PikFan	I like what you did with [[Gate]]; it's more comprehensive, and you can actually link to the types of gates

2015-02-19 20:21:25	@PikFan	the hazard pages do look good
2015-02-19 20:22:10	@PikFan	I never really considered fire geysers, electric wires, etc as obstacles
2015-02-19 20:24:07	@PikFan	on the note of obstacle names, I still disagree with the fact that we should use lower case in lists
2015-02-19 20:25:14	@PikFan	I don't mind using them lower case in regular text and stuff, but lower case in lists just seems... wrong
2015-02-19 20:27:42	@PikFan	but then, that raises the question of capitalizing fire geysers in lists
2015-02-19 20:27:53	@PikFan	that I disagree with
2015-02-19 20:28:02	@PikFan	...and I just contradicted myself
2015-02-19 20:28:04	@PikFan	yay
2015-02-19 20:29:02	@PikFan	meh, I guess obstacles will stay LC in lists, even if I don't like it
2015-02-19 20:29:29	@PikFan	anyway, I need ideas for fanon obstacles
2015-02-19 20:30:01	@PikFan	I want to draw the rest of the Distant Desert, but I want to be able to have obstacles
2015-02-19 20:30:28	@PikFan	electrodes could be used to power not just light bulbs, but other types of machinery, too

2015-02-21 17:05:34	Yoshi2_	my interpreter has a performance of around 180 thousand operations per second, but that is probably not very quick
2015-02-21 17:08:24	@Espyo	it doesn't sound very quick, no
2015-02-21 17:08:31	@Espyo	but it doesn't really sound slow

2015-02-22 14:55:40	MS	It says it recognized it instantly  and asks if l want to calibrate it.
2015-02-22 14:55:50	Ultimate	Ok
2015-02-22 14:56:06	MS	It doesn't ask if l want to use it,but l can still use the D-pad.
2015-02-22 14:56:28	MS	l still use the D-pad for aiming with the bow though.
2015-02-22 14:56:38	@J	[14:17:25] @Espyo by the way, today I dreamed you were 34 years old
2015-02-22 14:56:43	@J	that is weird
2015-02-22 14:56:49	@Espyo	quite
2015-02-22 14:57:07	@Espyo	but hey, I also dreamed of a revolutionary new HTML idea
2015-02-22 14:57:10	@Espyo	custom context menus
2015-02-22 14:57:21	Yoshi2	J: looking at screenshots of the old minecraft servers I used to play on always hits me with a huge amount of nostalgia
2015-02-22 14:57:24	@Espyo	imagine on wikis, you right-click a link
2015-02-22 14:57:25	MS	l use the C-stick for camera control while moving around without aiming.
2015-02-22 14:57:36	@Espyo	and there are options on the context menu to open the link, in a new tab, etc., the usual things
2015-02-22 14:57:48	@Espyo	but also commands to open the respective talk page, the respective edit page, history page, etc.
2015-02-22 14:57:54	@J	hmm
2015-02-22 14:57:55	MS	You on?
2015-02-22 14:58:02	@J	well, you wouldn't call it context menus
2015-02-22 14:58:14	@Espyo	they're options in the existing right-click context menu
2015-02-22 14:58:26	@J	you would call it link metadata, and most browsers would display it as context menu data
2015-02-22 14:58:31	@J	but you wouldn't have to do it that way
2015-02-22 14:58:52	@Espyo	what do you have in mind?
2015-02-22 14:59:28	@J	nothing in particular, that's just the way specifications like HTML work
2015-02-22 15:00:40	@Espyo	hm

2015-02-22 15:11:42	Ultimate	Yup
2015-02-22 15:12:35	Yoshi2	is that a honest "that went good" or a sarcastic "that went good"?
2015-02-22 15:12:44	MS	Honest.
2015-02-22 15:12:51	MS	But said sarcastically.
2015-02-22 15:13:11	MS	l'm on PokÃ©mon shuffle.
2015-02-22 15:14:03	Ultimate	I'm on Citizens of Earth. Already done my dose of PokÃ©mon Shuffle today.

2015-02-22 15:21:22	Ultimate	Either Absol or Rotom. Maybe Lucario?
2015-02-22 15:21:51	MS	I wonder why Mew is weaker than Absol, at a higher level too.
2015-02-22 15:22:31	MS	l'm out of hearts.
2015-02-22 15:22:44	Ultimate	Everyone can get to Mew straight away. But with the extra levels, you have to do a bit of work for.
2015-02-22 15:23:03	MS	I know, it still seems odd.
2015-02-22 15:23:21	MS	l beat stage two aswell but they got away

2015-02-22 15:26:56	Yoshi2	I am not sure why you would think that
2015-02-22 15:27:06	Mariostar	We should have a Ice climbers wiki.
2015-02-22 15:27:13	Mariostar	Think about it.

2015-02-22 15:27:41	@Espyo	if I wanted to stalk you, you wouldn't even suspect it
2015-02-22 15:27:47	@Espyo	and it certainly wouldn't be through a public IRC room
2015-02-22 15:27:53	Mariostar	4 or 5 pages.
2015-02-22 15:28:50	Mariostar	Or would you?....      No, I know, I just thought about it, because you're here whenever I am and never say anything.
2015-02-22 15:29:34	@Espyo	I'm always here during the weekend

2015-02-22 15:38:28	Ultimate	*everyone moves*
2015-02-22 15:38:40	Yoshi2_	considering that everybody can go on an irc server and create a new channel, that is not suprising

2015-02-22 15:39:12	Yoshi2_	I've now created the #Yoshi2FanClub

2015-02-24 19:30:02	@Espyo	only thing I can think of is he ditched camelcase
2015-02-24 19:31:01	Yoshi2	did he ever use camelcase?

2015-02-27 19:44:17	@Espyo	calm down Testyo, one sentence at a time
2015-02-27 19:44:17	Testyo	yeah, we plan on changing it was surreal
2015-02-27 19:46:43	Yoshi2_	Testyo: is the dress black and blue? (y/n)
2015-02-27 19:46:43	Testyo	Yeah.
2015-02-27 19:46:48	Yoshi2_	hmpf
2015-02-27 19:48:00	@Espyo	it really IS all over the place
2015-02-27 19:48:07	@Espyo	today at work, everybody exploded
2015-02-27 19:48:39	Yoshi2_	it is crazy
2015-02-27 19:48:59	Yoshi2_	you could ask somebody "what's the colour?" and that person would most likely have an idea what you are talking about
2015-02-27 19:49:38	Yoshi2_	I'm one of those people who do not see it as black and blue
2015-02-27 19:51:32	@J	what is going on
2015-02-27 19:51:57	Yoshi2_	J: it is better if you don't know

2015-02-27 20:00:51	@Espyo	<Yoshi2_> you could ask somebody "what's the colour?" and that person would most likely have an idea what you are talking about
2015-02-27 20:00:52	@Espyo	exactly
2015-02-27 20:00:55	@Espyo	provided you're not J
2015-02-27 20:01:04	@Espyo	just google "dress color", J
2015-02-27 20:01:10	@Espyo	and chances are you'll find it right away
2015-02-27 20:06:18	@J	it sounds really interesting, so I'll do that right away
2015-02-27 20:07:25	@Espyo	oh, snap, I forgot something
2015-02-27 20:07:27	@Espyo	you're color blind...
2015-02-27 20:07:36	@Espyo	well, you should still be able to get SOMETHING out of it
2015-02-27 20:07:51	@Espyo	I don't think your color-blindness will get much in the way of it, judging from what I know about color-blindness
2015-02-27 20:35:02	@J	I just learned a crazy thing
2015-02-27 20:35:15	@J	so Unix/Linux line endings are \r\n
2015-02-27 20:35:30	@J	if you just echo \r in a terminal, it moves the cursor to the start of the line
2015-02-27 20:35:36	@J	but it doesn't move to the next line
2015-02-27 20:36:02	@Espyo	...what?
2015-02-27 20:36:08	@Espyo	Unix/Linux line endings are \n
2015-02-27 20:36:08	@J	so if you want to show an updating display really easily, you just echo \r then overwrite the line
2015-02-27 20:36:11	@J	uh
2015-02-27 20:36:12	@Espyo	Mac is \r
2015-02-27 20:36:16	@J	yeah, silly me
2015-02-27 20:36:16	@Espyo	windows is \r\n for no good reason
2015-02-27 20:36:22	@J	yeah, just \n
2015-02-27 20:36:26	@J	but \r does a thing
2015-02-27 20:36:32	@J	and it's crazy
2015-02-27 20:36:37	@Espyo	yeah, I think I learned that some time ago
2015-02-27 20:36:41	@J	it even works if you do tail
2015-02-27 20:36:41	@Espyo	or didn't, but speculated
2015-02-27 20:36:51	@Espyo	because hey, I had to find some reasoning for there being two characters
2015-02-27 20:36:55	@Espyo	and I was more or less right
2015-02-27 20:37:00	@J	the tail -f output changes as it reads it
2015-02-27 20:37:05	@J	it's really weird
2015-02-27 20:37:09	@Espyo	hm
2015-02-27 20:38:24	@Espyo	but anyway, yeah, the terminal is a magical thing
2015-02-27 20:38:30	@Espyo	and then I go back to windows'
2015-02-27 20:38:32	@Espyo	and it's just...
2015-02-27 20:39:02	@J	but why wouldn't you want to copy/paste in blocks?
2015-02-27 20:39:22	@Espyo	yeah, epic feature
2015-02-27 20:39:31	@Espyo	for programs I WANT to select in blocks, that's not a thing
2015-02-27 20:39:36	@Espyo	for the command line, it is
2015-02-27 20:39:39	@Espyo	brilliant
2015-02-27 20:42:02	@Espyo	at work, all machines run Linux, we have one game machine so we can test the games on something that isn't our simple laptops
2015-02-27 20:42:15	@Espyo	but for some reason, we have to run a script to enable the mouse, after every boot
2015-02-27 20:42:18	@J	games?
2015-02-27 20:42:24	@Espyo	casino games
2015-02-27 20:42:30	@Espyo	didn't I mention that's what I do at work, here?
2015-02-27 20:42:35	@Espyo	mostly electronic bingo
2015-02-27 20:42:40	@J	yeah, probably
2015-02-27 20:42:55	@Espyo	that machine also opens xterm at startup
2015-02-27 20:42:58	@J	I was wondering if you meant that, or one for playing games at breaks or something
2015-02-27 20:43:01	@Espyo	so today, I read that you can just edit ~/.bashrc to add any commands you want to run with the terminal
2015-02-27 20:43:06	@Espyo	and boom, instant mouse on bootup
2015-02-27 20:43:07	@Espyo	felt good
2015-02-27 20:43:23	@J	hmm...
2015-02-27 20:43:26	@Espyo	hm, we could play them during breaks, if we already didn't play them all the time to work on them
2015-02-27 20:43:41	@J	instead you probably want a script associated with the login stuff
2015-02-27 20:43:48	@J	otherwise it will run on every new terminal
2015-02-27 20:43:58	@Espyo	tough that is a non problem
2015-02-27 20:44:05	@Espyo	it goes from having the mouse enabled to having the mouse enabled
2015-02-27 20:44:11	@J	yeah but
2015-02-27 20:44:15	Yoshi2_	playing casino games sounds much less exciting than working on them
2015-02-27 20:44:15	@Espyo	but anyway, I think they use their own in-house distro
2015-02-27 20:44:24	@Espyo	which explains why stuff doesn't really... uh...
2015-02-27 20:44:27	@Espyo	well, it's not really normal
2015-02-27 20:44:32	@Espyo	it's just a terminal running a game, no logins
2015-02-27 20:44:42	@Espyo	<Yoshi2_> playing casino games sounds much less exciting than working on them
2015-02-27 20:44:46	@Espyo	good thing the sales numbers disagree
2015-02-27 20:44:54	@Espyo	but yes, I for one enjoy working on them a LOT more
2015-02-27 20:45:03	@Espyo	except the part where I have to work with code that isn't mine
2015-02-27 20:45:07	@Espyo	that's always a bother :|
2015-02-27 20:45:42	@J	wait, your main computers are laptops?
2015-02-27 20:45:47	Yoshi2_	that is always an issue
2015-02-27 20:45:54	@Espyo	mhm, laptops
2015-02-27 20:46:01	@J	do you use separate keyboard/mouse/monitor?
2015-02-27 20:46:04	@Espyo	we do
2015-02-27 20:46:17	@Espyo	even if we didn't, it wouldn't be THAT bad
2015-02-27 20:46:19	@Espyo	at least not for me
2015-02-27 20:46:24	@J	hmm
2015-02-27 20:46:45	@J	well, anyway, they probably use customised Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or something
2015-02-27 20:46:56	@Espyo	likely, yeah
2015-02-27 20:47:16	@Espyo	or the distro was made by one of the companies they bought
2015-02-27 20:47:19	@Espyo	it's... a bit complicated
2015-02-27 20:47:33	@J	hardly anyone makes a distro from scratch, though
2015-02-27 20:47:42	@Espyo	they DID have a meeting for the 5th anniversary, with everybody in the company (we're around 60, so we all fit in a single meeting room)
2015-02-27 20:47:51	@Espyo	and they did explain the steps the company took through time
2015-02-27 20:48:01	@Espyo	and I know the distro has a logo for a company that we... bought
2015-02-27 20:48:15	@Espyo	I'm not sure if we bought it, if we were born form it, or what else
2015-02-27 20:48:21	@Espyo	it was more of a party than a teaching meeting
2015-02-27 20:48:23	@Espyo	*shrug*
2015-02-27 20:48:45	@Espyo	but yeah, nobody really makes them from scratch, and I doubt a company that has to spend work time on the games would be spending it on a full distro
2015-02-27 20:48:58	@Espyo	the games run under OpenGL
2015-02-27 20:49:08	@Espyo	so at the very least, a LOT would have to be done to make a distro that worked
2015-02-27 20:51:43	Yoshi2_	is it that difficult to get some graphics drivers running from scratch?
2015-02-27 20:52:09	@Espyo	I'd imagine so
2015-02-27 20:53:30	@J	I mean, it's certainly doable
2015-02-27 20:53:40	@J	you just have to download and compile a load of stuff
2015-02-27 20:53:58	@J	but why would you, unless you were specifically learning how to do that
2015-02-27 20:55:10	@Espyo	right
2015-02-27 20:58:06	@J	sounds fun though

2015-02-28 14:59:06	Ford4385	Hello
2015-02-28 14:59:15	Ford4385	Now I can see the chat
2015-02-28 15:01:16	@Espyo	hi
2015-02-28 15:01:48	Ford4385	Did you find out the answer to my question? The one about the two skitterleafs?
2015-02-28 15:02:07	@Espyo	not yet
2015-02-28 15:02:13	@Espyo	I rarely get on Pikmin 3, because I'm so busy
2015-02-28 15:02:19	@Espyo	but I keep a list down of things I have to check when I do
2015-02-28 15:02:45	Ford4385	Ok. As long as you try. I just think it is an important thing to mention
2015-02-28 15:03:30	@Espyo	agreed
2015-02-28 15:03:33	@Espyo	don't worry, I will
2015-02-28 15:04:15	Ford4385	I also wondered that. I mean it's very logical question, seeing as skitterleafs are essentially Dwarf Bulborbs
2015-02-28 15:04:42	@Espyo	yep
2015-02-28 15:08:39	Ford4385	Do you know if there is a glitch with the chat? Because sometimes it only loads to having InfoServ saying the message of the day
2015-02-28 15:08:54	@Espyo	might be slow
2015-02-28 15:09:08	@Espyo	I wasn't being able to join some days ago, so I tried the web app on the wiki
2015-02-28 15:09:14	@Espyo	and had to wait like 2 minutes before it connected
2015-02-28 15:09:17	@Espyo	so it probably happens commonly
2015-02-28 15:10:18	Ford4385	Ok
2015-02-28 15:10:36	Ford4385	It just gets annoying.
2015-02-28 15:10:40	Yoshi2_	I have similar issues on other IRC servers
2015-02-28 15:11:16	Ford4385	Also what gets kind of annoying is the fact that only 3 people are chatting with a total of 8 people online
2015-02-28 15:11:33	@Espyo	would you prefer 3/8 people chatting, or 3/3?
2015-02-28 15:12:10	Yoshi2_	Chanserv is a bot/service, Testyo is a bot
2015-02-28 15:12:11	Testyo	search the file for like "novice training" and replace some characters, keeping the redirected page?
2015-02-28 15:12:25	@Espyo	yep
2015-02-28 15:12:25	Yoshi2_	so that makes it 3/6 people talking
2015-02-28 15:12:42	Ford4385	Well, Its just you come in expecting atleast 1 other person to talk, and half the time no one does
2015-02-28 15:13:11	@Espyo	because we're all busy
2015-02-28 15:13:14	@Espyo	we're here almost all day, sure
2015-02-28 15:13:20	@Espyo	but we're not just sitting here staring at the chat
2015-02-28 15:13:26	@Espyo	we just keep the chat on one tab, and do something else
2015-02-28 15:13:34	@Espyo	and when people come, sure, we greet them, and talk
2015-02-28 15:13:38	@Espyo	sometimes we don't simply because we missed it
2015-02-28 15:13:57	Yoshi2_	if you add the name of the person you are talking to in your message, that increases the chances that the person will see the message
2015-02-28 15:14:02	Yoshi2_	and maybe respond to it
2015-02-28 15:14:09	Ford4385	Ok
2015-02-28 15:14:18	@Espyo	because the chat client normally plays a sound
2015-02-28 15:14:23	@Espyo	to warn that people that they've been called
2015-02-28 15:14:30	@Espyo	but if you do that too often, you'll just be annoying
2015-02-28 15:14:59	Ford4385	It only plays a sound if someone says your name?
2015-02-28 15:15:06	@Espyo	depends
2015-02-28 15:15:13	@Espyo	like, not all of us use the app on the wiki
2015-02-28 15:15:20	@Espyo	others use a program on their computer to chat with
2015-02-28 15:15:25	@Espyo	others use Mibbit on its own web page
2015-02-28 15:15:31	@Espyo	and everything has its settings
2015-02-28 15:15:35	@Espyo	to play sounds, flash windows, do nothing, etc.
2015-02-28 15:15:54	Ford4385	So if your on the wiki it will play sounds when they mention you?
2015-02-28 15:15:58	Yoshi2_	standalone chat clients, i.e. those that run without a browser, usually have a setting to play a sound when your name is mentioned
2015-02-28 15:16:10	Yoshi2_	i am not sure about the web client on the wiki
2015-02-28 15:16:14	@Espyo	uh, I think so, yeah
2015-02-28 15:16:24	Ford4385	If you mention my name, I can find out
2015-02-28 15:16:25	@Espyo	try switching to a new tab, and I'll call your name in 10 seconds
2015-02-28 15:16:36	@Espyo	Ford4385:
2015-02-28 15:17:11	Ford4385	Nothing. Maybe try again
2015-02-28 15:17:15	@Espyo	okay
2015-02-28 15:17:17	@Espyo	Ford4385
2015-02-28 15:17:19	@Espyo	Ford4385,
2015-02-28 15:17:23	@Espyo	Ford4385 Ford4385
2015-02-28 15:17:46	@Espyo	maybe it only does it on a Mibbit tab
2015-02-28 15:17:55	@Espyo	like, actual chat.mibbit.com, instead of the app on the wiki
2015-02-28 15:18:14	@Espyo	Ford4385 (once more)
2015-02-28 15:18:42	Yoshi2_	odd, the mibbit client on the wiki takes a pretty long time to connect
2015-02-28 15:18:58	@Espyo	so it's not just me and him
2015-02-28 15:19:18	Ford4385	Well, it doesnt make a sound

2015-02-28 15:19:33	@Espyo	yoshi3: check if it makes a sound for you
2015-02-28 15:19:39	@Espyo	oh, well, you beat me to it

2015-02-28 15:19:46	Yoshi2_	yoshi3: 
2015-02-28 15:20:00	yoshi3	no sound
2015-02-28 15:20:13	@Espyo	oh well

2015-02-28 15:20:50	Ford4385	Wheres yoshi 1?
2015-02-28 15:21:21	Yoshi2_	sit down as I tell you the story of my name
2015-02-28 15:21:42	Yoshi2_	Once upon a time, the official nintendo website had a forum
2015-02-28 15:22:06	Yoshi2_	I liked Yoshi, so I thought about naming myself "Yoshi" on the forum
2015-02-28 15:22:12	Yoshi2_	but the name was taken already
2015-02-28 15:22:24	Yoshi2_	so I went ahead and just called myself "Yoshi2", which wasn't taken
2015-02-28 15:22:48	Ford4385	Ok
2015-02-28 15:22:58	Ford4385	But why the _ at the end
2015-02-28 15:23:26	Yoshi2_	alternative nick for when Yoshi2 is taken on this irc server, e.g. when I had a disconnect
2015-02-28 15:23:29	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2015-02-28 15:24:01	Ford4385	ok
2015-02-28 15:24:26	Testyo	https://github.com/RenolY2/py-playBMS/blob/master/EventParsers/ParserCreator.py#L97 bother to clear allocated memory for bitmaps?
2015-02-28 15:24:50	@Espyo	that has nothing to do with bitmaps, Testyo
2015-02-28 15:24:51	Testyo	yep, that bother to clear allocated memory for bitmaps?
2015-02-28 15:24:55	@Espyo	at least it doesn't look like it
2015-02-28 15:25:01	@Espyo	...Testyo, you already asked that
2015-02-28 15:25:02	Testyo	news sections/pages are historically really badly maintained on the correction
2015-02-28 15:25:11	@Espyo	:|
2015-02-28 15:25:35	Yoshi2	I still kinda miss the nintendo forum
2015-02-28 15:25:44	Yoshi2	you even received 5 stars per day for logging in
2015-02-28 15:26:08	Ford4385	5 stars?
2015-02-28 15:26:13	@Espyo	hm
2015-02-28 15:26:14	Yoshi2	club nintendo stars
2015-02-28 15:26:18	@Espyo	woah
2015-02-28 15:26:28	Ford4385	I wish club nintendo had better stuff
2015-02-28 15:26:37	@Espyo	hopefully the replacement system will
2015-02-28 15:26:52	Ford4385	cause the U.S. club nintendo is bad
2015-02-28 15:26:57	Yoshi2	the NA club nintendo has a lot of neat stuff to spend coins on now
2015-02-28 15:27:51	Ford4385	Some games,
2015-02-28 15:28:41	Ford4385	Theres also physical stuff, but not really good physical items
2015-02-28 15:28:54	Yoshi2	yeah
2015-02-28 15:29:43	Ford4385	Maybe the MM T-Shirt (or is it a puzzle?)
2015-02-28 15:30:03	Yoshi2	the European Club Nintendo has some physical stuff, but not much digital stuff
2015-02-28 15:30:30	Ford4385	Well the NA club just got 117 games for the ending of club nintendo here

2015-02-28 15:56:39	Yoshi2	you could try a standalone irc client and see if that changes anything

2015-02-28 15:59:57	@Espyo	hm
2015-02-28 16:00:00	@Espyo	not much we can do, though
2015-02-28 16:00:34	Ford4385	Yes
2015-02-28 16:01:10	Ford4385	Maybe I just need to be patient

2015-02-28 16:04:22	Yoshi2	up to a specific point, it does involve some patience
2015-02-28 16:05:04	Ford4385	Which is something I lack. Which always annoyed me in pikmin 1
2015-02-28 16:07:28	Ford4385	Also the shaggy long legs fight. I atleast found out how not to fight it
2015-02-28 16:09:48	Ford4385	That was most definitely fun
2015-02-28 16:11:28	Yoshi2	not fighting it was fun?
2015-02-28 16:12:18	Ford4385	No. I found out the way your not supposed to fight it. Apparently charging its legs is a bad idea
2015-02-28 16:13:43	Yoshi2	ah, I see
2015-02-28 16:14:14	Ford4385	And that you shouln't attack it with winged pikmin
2015-02-28 16:14:58	Ford4385	Or to atleast get rid of the hair first
2015-02-28 16:21:43	Ford4385	You can change the color?
2015-02-28 16:21:53	Ford4385	Apparently yes
2015-02-28 16:23:35	Yoshi2	color support is not an integral part of IRC, but a lot of clients have defined some special characters to be used as color codes
2015-02-28 16:25:04	Ford4385	Ok
2015-02-28 16:27:12	Ford4385	And they have the colors of the pikmin
2015-02-28 16:27:51	Yoshi2	red, blue, yellow, black, white, purple
2015-02-28 16:28:07	Ford4385	Pink and grey
2015-02-28 16:28:14	Ford4385	For winged and rocks
2015-02-28 16:32:33	Ford4385	Does anyone actually have a theory of if they will include the other pikmin? From the end of pikmin 1, the onions? (sorry about spoilers for some)
2015-02-28 16:33:32	Yoshi2	I haven't played through pikmin 1 yet :(
2015-02-28 16:34:17	Ford4385	Sorry if I spoiled it
2015-02-28 16:34:36	@Espyo	I don't think it has any gameplay meaning
2015-02-28 16:35:02	@Espyo	it just shows that the planet of the Pikmin is so diverse, that there are a lot of Pikmin types, but not all of them are suitable for gameplay
2015-02-28 16:36:35	Ford4385	How did you do the bar? And maybe nintendo will add the pikmin
2015-02-28 16:37:02	@Espyo	it's some IRC magic
2015-02-28 16:37:06	@Espyo	it's a bit hard to do without the right tools
2015-02-28 16:37:49	Ford4385	So I probably couldnt do it
2015-02-28 16:37:56	@Espyo	probably
2015-02-28 16:38:01	@Espyo	actually, yeah, you can
2015-02-28 16:38:04	@Espyo	on Mibbit is sort of easy
2015-02-28 16:38:07	@Espyo	do /style 1 1
2015-02-28 16:38:14	@Espyo	the first 1 is the text color, the second is the background
2015-02-28 16:38:18	@Espyo	if they're the same, voilÃ¡
2015-02-28 16:38:23	@Espyo	do /style 1 to return to normal
2015-02-28 16:38:44	Ford4385	Ok?
2015-02-28 16:39:14	Yoshi2	there are colour codes for the background
2015-02-28 16:39:34	Yoshi2	so if you make the background and the text both the same color, you have that
2015-02-28 16:39:37	Ford4385	Maybe this?
2015-02-28 16:40:16	Ford4385	This?
2015-02-28 16:40:58	Yoshi2	the last one does it right, as far as I can tell
2015-02-28 16:40:58	Ford4385	Its pink!
2015-02-28 16:41:05	Ford4385	Like the winged pikmin!
2015-02-28 16:42:14	Ford4385	If you can't tell winged are my favorite
2015-02-28 16:43:59	Yoshi2	ah, I see
2015-02-28 16:44:36	Yoshi2	winged pikmin are pretty cool, I'd use them everywhere if they weren't so weak
2015-02-28 16:44:48	Yoshi2	I like rock pikmin very much
2015-02-28 16:45:11	Ford4385	Yeah, I hate how weak they are. But Spray a spicy spray, with a large squad. You got a powerful threat
2015-02-28 16:50:37	Ford4385	I use rocks against bulborbs, when I don't want to risk my wings

2015-02-28 16:52:13	Ford4385	Yeah. I do need to fight the Plasma wraith, and I'll use rocks for that
2015-02-28 16:57:22	Ford4385	It is a ok strategy to use rocks right?
2015-02-28 16:59:00	Yoshi2	any strategy that does not make you lose a lot of pikmin is an ok strategy, in my opinion

2015-02-28 18:33:44	@PikFan	ok so remember how in Pikmin 1 the Pikmin would follow another path to get to the Onion if their way was blocked?
2015-02-28 18:34:08	@PikFan	they don't do that in P2 and 3
2015-02-28 18:34:38	@PikFan	they just run endlessly into whatever's blocking their way
2015-02-28 18:36:16	@PikFan	also I had a Pikmin-related dream last night
2015-02-28 18:36:53	@PikFan	in Pikmin 2, if you did a special thing before the debt was paid, the Ship would have different dialogs

2015-03-01 14:46:32	Yoshi2	the poll doesn't seem to be showing up for me, but that might be just my combination of noscript and an adblocker
2015-03-01 14:47:31	@Espyo	hence why I added a "poll not showing?" text next to it
2015-03-01 14:48:30	Yoshi2	funny enough, that text does not do anything for me

2015-03-01 14:49:48	@J	why would it get blocked as an advert?
2015-03-01 14:51:11	@J	anyway, the main page is too wide now - it needs around 1200px to view properly
2015-03-01 14:51:29	@J	not terrible, but it would be good to have it below 1000px
2015-03-01 14:51:49	Yoshi2	I think my adblocker isn't actually blocking anything here, noscript is probably the issue here
2015-03-01 14:52:30	Yoshi2	looking at the page source, the poll references a js script from the polldaddy site

2015-03-01 18:42:13	Yoshi2_	doesn't help that the game is from a developer in east europe, and every single English reference to it is from a fake software hoster :/
2015-03-01 18:47:55	@Espyo	hm
2015-03-01 18:48:01	@Espyo	what a weird story

2015-03-01 18:53:25	Yoshi2_	Espyo: it is quite weird indeed, there are barely any references to that version of the game I used to play
2015-03-01 18:55:01	Yoshi2_	quite disappointing, because I have some fond memories of that game
2015-03-01 18:58:46	@Espyo	can you describe it?
2015-03-01 19:00:15	Yoshi2_	I already know the name of the game, it's just that it is an entire series of games now, and I am unable to find the original version that I played back then
2015-03-01 19:01:36	@Espyo	hm, ok
2015-03-01 19:02:27	Yoshi2_	the name of the game, as far as I can tell, is brave dwarves
2015-03-01 19:02:39	Yoshi2_	and this is how I remember it looking like: http://i.imgur.com/tzwXiR2.gif
2015-03-01 19:03:04	Yoshi2_	but if you search for it on google, you will find a lot of screenshots contains completely different graphics, even pre-rendered ones
2015-03-01 19:03:24	Yoshi2_	you will also find a lot of fake file hosters who claim to have the game, so it is a minefield

2015-03-01 20:33:20	Ford4385	Good job Testyo
2015-03-01 20:33:21	Testyo	well, not sure why, but in a single file, it's a bit weird
2015-03-01 20:34:38	Ford4385	I really think we mentioned the Treasure Hoard
2015-03-01 20:35:18	Yoshi2	so if you had a boolean function that takes two values x1, x2 and outputs True only when the first value is true and the second value is false, or when both values are false, the DNF of it is x1*not(x2) + not(x1)*not(x2)

2015-03-01 20:35:29	Yoshi2	with * being the boolean AND and + being the boolean OR
2015-03-01 20:36:21	Ford4385	I have absolutely no clue what you are saying
2015-03-01 20:38:17	Yoshi2	for the most part, that's just boolean logic
2015-03-01 20:39:24	Ford4385	Which I have no clue what that is]
2015-03-01 20:44:21	Yoshi2	it is a part of maths that deals with the values True and False, and functions that only take those two values
2015-03-01 20:44:22	Ford4385	I have no clue what Boolean logic is
2015-03-01 20:44:28	Yoshi2	basically, I think
2015-03-01 20:44:31	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-01 20:45:14	Yoshi2	so you have the boolean and, which returns true if both values are true
2015-03-01 20:45:29	Yoshi2	or, which is true when either of the two values are true
2015-03-01 20:45:45	Yoshi2	and you have not, which simply negates a value, i.e. True becomes False and vice versa
2015-03-01 20:45:55	Ford4385	Ok...
2015-03-01 20:46:23	Yoshi2	and every other boolean function can be constructed using 'and', 'or' and 'not'
2015-03-01 20:47:15	Ford4385	I think the only word in those sentences I truly understood was "can"
2015-03-01 20:49:16	@J	you can write 'and' given 'or' and 'not'
2015-03-01 20:50:02	Ford4385	Those too
2015-03-01 20:50:17	Yoshi2	if you are familiar with maths, you should have an idea of what "function" means
2015-03-01 20:50:28	@J	and that's kind of weird, in maths you usually use ^ for 'and' and v for 'or'
2015-03-01 20:50:38	@J	and obviously Â¬
2015-03-01 20:50:46	Yoshi2	yeah
2015-03-01 20:51:33	Ford4385	I know, but its the weekend, and math doesnt count

2015-03-02 21:12:54	@Espyo	it MIGHT have been related to Espio, from the Sonic franchise
2015-03-02 21:13:02	@Espyo	but I don't think so, 'cause I was never a big fan of him

2015-03-02 21:16:51	Testyo	I have to do it before the new one broke too, very quickly, so it was somehow killing hard drives

2015-03-02 21:18:58	Testyo	we use CC-BY-SA, which means any redistribution of the argument only removes game icons, it's called 'noicons'; for those that do other things too, it's 'clash'

2015-03-02 21:20:01	@Espyo	it's a midi, and Yoshi2_'s been going all around with SMS and Pikmin 2 music, and it says "musico", which is pretty Italian
2015-03-02 21:20:13	Ford4385	Maybe
2015-03-02 21:20:19	Ford4385	I always loved Sunshine
2015-03-02 21:20:45	Ford4385	I really don't wanna download, but I wanna know what it is

2015-03-02 21:22:17	Ford4385	I'm assuming its Demo Background music

2015-03-02 22:45:07	Ford4385	Hey espyo
2015-03-02 22:45:10	@Espyo	hmm?
2015-03-02 22:45:18	Ford4385	For testyo's hangman
2015-03-02 22:45:19	Testyo	the your OS?
2015-03-02 22:45:30	Ford4385	why dont you make it names of the articles on this wiki
2015-03-02 22:45:36	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-03-02 22:45:38	Ford4385	Instead of a random word
2015-03-02 22:45:46	@Espyo	good idea
2015-03-02 22:45:58	@Espyo	although there are a few problems
2015-03-02 22:46:03	@Espyo	for one thing, there can be no spaces
2015-03-02 22:46:15	@Espyo	and almost all enemy, ship part, treasure and fruit names have two words or more
2015-03-02 22:46:21	@Espyo	so that only leaves a few terms left
2015-03-02 22:46:29	@Espyo	and playing with a pool of 50 words or so is kind of boring
2015-03-02 22:46:33	@Espyo	it's a good idea on paper, but...
2015-03-02 22:46:36	@Espyo	it probably wouldn't work
2015-03-02 22:46:53	Ford4385	Yeah
2015-03-02 22:47:00	Ford4385	But In hangman there can be spaces
2015-03-02 22:47:05	Ford4385	You just dont guess it
2015-03-02 22:47:19	@Espyo	hm
2015-03-02 22:47:21	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-03-02 22:47:31	@Espyo	though I'd have to implement a space detection/ignoration system
2015-03-02 22:48:13	Ford4385	Yeah
2015-03-02 22:52:49	Ford4385	Espyo, remember how I asked that question about the skitter leafs?
2015-03-02 22:54:36	@Espyo	mhm?
2015-03-02 22:54:52	Ford4385	I found out the answer
2015-03-02 22:55:23	@Espyo	oh?
2015-03-02 22:55:55	Ford4385	Yes even the frail wings can crush skitter leafs
2015-03-02 22:57:14	Ford4385	Its suprised me... but the wings can kill the skitter leafs
2015-03-02 22:58:28	@Espyo	neat
2015-03-02 22:58:35	@Espyo	add it to the wiki, please
2015-03-02 22:59:26	Ford4385	I think its already there that all pikmin can crush it
2015-03-02 22:59:43	@Espyo	oh
2015-03-02 22:59:50	@Espyo	[[Skitter Leaf]]
2015-03-02 22:59:50	Testyo	"Skitter_Leaf" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Skitter_Leaf
2015-03-02 23:01:26	Ford4385	Well the skitter leaf article states
2015-03-02 23:01:50	Ford4385	http://mibpaste.com/47dLn4 
2015-03-02 23:02:04	@Espyo	yep
2015-03-02 23:02:16	Ford4385	My question was on the dessicated, which I just proved
2015-03-02 23:02:23	@Espyo	ah
2015-03-02 23:02:33	Ford4385	Im not sure about regularly, but while resting they do die instantly
2015-03-02 23:03:01	Ford4385	I'll restart the day and find out
2015-03-02 23:03:31	@Espyo	ok
2015-03-02 23:05:21	Ford4385	Winged pikmin will have to attack it while its not resting
2015-03-02 23:05:38	Ford4385	I just sacrificed 2 winged pikmin to find out
2015-03-02 23:07:49	@Espyo	so does that mean Wingeds won't OHKO it if it's moving?
2015-03-02 23:08:12	Ford4385	Yes
2015-03-02 23:08:34	Ford4385	Wings have to attack it like they would a dwarf bulborb for example
2015-03-02 23:08:35	@Espyo	I think it's worth adding to the article
2015-03-02 23:09:06	Ford4385	[[Desiccated Skitter Leaf]]
2015-03-02 23:09:06	Testyo	"Desiccated_Skitter_Leaf" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Desiccated_Skitter_Leaf
2015-03-02 23:11:27	Ford4385	How about this?
2015-03-02 23:11:28	Ford4385	Although they are agile, Desiccated Skitter Leaves are extremely frail, and will die instantly if a Pikmin is thrown on top of one. Winged Pikmin are the only exception because they can crush a resting Desiccated Skitter Leaf, but not an active one. These creatures can snatch and eat Pikmin quickly, so if one is on the attack, caution must be taken.
2015-03-02 23:11:39	Ford4385	(this is under behavior)
2015-03-02 23:12:28	@Espyo	sounds good
2015-03-02 23:12:50	Ford4385	Ok I added that sentence: Winged Pikmin are the only exception because they can crush a resting Desiccated Skitter Leaf, but not an active one
2015-03-02 23:14:39	Ford4385	Also Espyo, do you know where the best place to raise yellow is? (in pikmin 3)

2015-03-02 23:15:38	Ford4385	Does testyo state all the changes made?
2015-03-02 23:15:39	Testyo	it's a little different is in a few days
2015-03-02 23:15:46	@Espyo	not really @yellows
2015-03-02 23:15:54	@Espyo	and he states most of them
2015-03-02 23:16:07	@Espyo	like, he'll only post 2 of the recent changes in 5 minutes
2015-03-02 23:16:15	@Espyo	if people make 3 changes in 5 minutes, he'll just hide the 3rd
2015-03-02 23:16:18	@Espyo	that way he won't spam the channel
2015-03-02 23:16:21	@Espyo	specially if people do like 30
2015-03-02 23:16:34	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-02 23:21:56	Ford4385	Is there anything you want check in Pikmin 3 or 2?

2015-03-02 23:24:54	Ford4385	Cause I might be able to check
2015-03-02 23:27:53	@Espyo	hm, not really

2015-03-04 19:25:54	@Espyo	I honestly don't understand how Piktoad fails to notice my edits on top of them
2015-03-04 19:25:59	@Espyo	where I remove the capitalization on the object names
2015-03-04 19:26:15	@Espyo	hi UltraMarlio
2015-03-04 19:28:46	Yoshi2	that is a bit odd, but maybe they will understand if you send them a message about that
2015-03-04 19:29:03	@Espyo	eh, it's not that important
2015-03-04 19:30:35	Yoshi2	fair enough
2015-03-04 19:32:02	@Espyo	bah
2015-03-04 19:32:11	@Espyo	somebody created a quote template on the Pikmin wikia
2015-03-04 19:32:17	@Espyo	that means their IQ is a positive number
2015-03-04 19:32:25	@Espyo	wish there was a way to get them to Pikipedia without using wikia's chat
2015-03-04 19:32:37	@Espyo	because wikia probably has Pikmin wiki under the radar for a bit
2015-03-04 19:32:51	@Espyo	after that admin came to a chat me and Kirby were having and was like "no."

2015-03-05 22:54:51	Spark	j, espyo, do either of you use python?
2015-03-05 22:55:18	@Espyo	J does
2015-03-05 22:55:27	@Espyo	I only know the absolute of the absolute basics
2015-03-05 22:55:36	Spark	the absolute basics might be enough
2015-03-05 22:55:44	Spark	im very bad at python lol
2015-03-05 22:55:50	Spark	so i have this:
2015-03-05 22:55:51	Spark	            print 'NifExportError' + str(e)
2015-03-05 22:56:00	@Espyo	the only Python I wrote was a script for HexChat that colors my text blue
2015-03-05 22:56:09	Spark	and its saying "invalid syntax" with an arrow pointing at the last '
2015-03-05 22:56:17	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-03-05 22:56:57	@Espyo	is that how you're meant to call print?
2015-03-05 22:57:22	Spark	i dont know, im modifying a blender plugin
2015-03-05 22:57:30	Spark	thats what was there
2015-03-05 22:57:39	Spark	 but its giving an error
2015-03-05 22:57:49	Spark	it looks right, though, based on what i know
2015-03-05 22:57:50	@Espyo	did you modify it?
2015-03-05 22:59:11	Spark	all ive modified was changing 'NifExportError: ' + str(e) to 'NifExportError' + str(e)
2015-03-05 22:59:22	Spark	i suspected the : might be causing the problem but it apparently wasnt
2015-03-05 23:00:07	@Espyo	how weird
2015-03-05 23:01:10	Spark	oh well, i suppose i could just remove that line
2015-03-05 23:01:14	Spark	it's not essential, i think
2015-03-05 23:01:30	Spark	by the way, you should upload that python hexchat script somewhere, im curious how you did it :P
2015-03-05 23:02:05	@J	it depends on the Python version
2015-03-05 23:02:15	@J	3 doesn't have a print statement, it has a print function
2015-03-05 23:02:30	@Espyo	I probably will, I got some friends to use HexChat over Mibbit, so they might want it
2015-03-05 23:02:43	Spark	well, that cant be it, because the error is pointing to the second '
2015-03-05 23:02:52	Spark	that wouldnt happen if it were that, would it
2015-03-05 23:03:07	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/auto_color.py boop
2015-03-05 23:03:12	@Espyo	it could happen
2015-03-05 23:03:38	@J	well, that's what happens, not sure why though
2015-03-05 23:03:53	Spark	oh
2015-03-05 23:03:58	Spark	okay, that explains it
2015-03-05 23:04:03	Spark	thanks j :)
2015-03-05 23:04:32	@J	no problem
2015-03-05 23:04:42	Spark	and espy, thanks for posting the script, that will be useful
2015-03-05 23:04:51	@Espyo	no prob
2015-03-05 23:05:00	@Espyo	I just self-learned the Python needed for that
2015-03-05 23:05:03	@Espyo	so chances are...
2015-03-05 23:05:07	@Espyo	there is some VERY gruesome code in there
2015-03-05 23:05:11	@Espyo	like... VERY gruesome
2015-03-05 23:05:16	@Espyo	and I would be none the wiser
2015-03-05 23:05:43	Spark	i know even less python than you, so it wont bother me at least :P
2015-03-05 23:06:14	@J	you can definitely tell you don't really know Python from that code
2015-03-05 23:06:29	@J	but Python makes it hard to do bad stuff as much as is really possible
2015-03-05 23:06:43	@J	so you never really end up with terrible code
2015-03-05 23:07:52	Spark	when i tried making that same script, a while back
2015-03-05 23:08:04	Spark	i dont recall exactly how i went about it, but it caused a crash
2015-03-05 23:08:23	Spark	xP
2015-03-05 23:11:33	Spark	i feel like by the time im done with this, i'll have memorized all the differences between whatever python version im using now and whatever version it was made for
2015-03-05 23:11:49	Spark	since apparently the only reason it doesnt work on newer versions of blender is outdated python
2015-03-05 23:14:32	@J	there aren't really that many backwards incompatibilities
2015-03-05 23:14:55	@J	and there's a tool called '2to3' which does the conversion for you, for most cases
2015-03-05 23:15:11	@J	it's probably included with your Python 3 installation
2015-03-05 23:15:34	Spark	hmm ill check
2015-03-05 23:17:24	Spark	nope
2015-03-05 23:18:43	@J	on Windows it looks like it would be C:\Python3x\Tools\Scripts\2to3.py
2015-03-05 23:19:40	Spark	alright thanks
2015-03-05 23:20:08	@J	and I should go now, bye
2015-03-05 23:20:35	Spark	bye!
2015-03-05 23:20:38	Spark	thanks for all the help
2015-03-05 23:20:50	@J	good luck getting it working

2015-03-07 19:33:05	Testyo	I said she isnt someone cursor and other things we don't really like? because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages she isnt someone from the wiki and you know when they ask about keeping the cursor and other things we don't really like?.

2015-03-08 16:37:17	Ford4385	Hello
2015-03-08 16:37:39	Yoshi2_	good day
2015-03-08 16:39:08	Ford4385	how are you?
2015-03-08 16:39:28	Yoshi2_	same as always
2015-03-08 16:40:54	Ford4385	me too
2015-03-08 16:43:12	Yoshi2_	it becomes difficult to answer the "how are you" question in a new way every day
2015-03-08 16:46:26	Ford4385	Yes
2015-03-08 16:55:36	Ford4385	How long do you have to be idle to be put in the "Idlers" category?
2015-03-08 16:56:02	Yoshi2_	what idlers category?
2015-03-08 16:58:36	Ford4385	It says Chatting and Idlers
2015-03-08 16:59:00	Ford4385	over to thr right
2015-03-08 16:59:15	Ford4385	With the list of the users
2015-03-08 16:59:40	Yoshi2_	ah, that's a thing implemented by mibbit
2015-03-08 17:00:11	Yoshi2_	no idea what criteria mibbit uses, it probably puts anybody who writes something in "Chatting"
2015-03-08 17:00:15	Yoshi2_	the rest stay in Idlers
2015-03-08 17:00:58	Ford4385	But if you dont say anything for a bit, you go into idlers
2015-03-08 17:01:14	Yoshi2_	very possible
2015-03-08 17:01:16	Ford4385	I was asking if anyone knew how long it actually was
2015-03-08 17:05:38	Yoshi2_	http://wiki.mibbit.com/index.php/Userlist 
2015-03-08 17:06:01	Yoshi2_	at the bottom it says that chatters are people who have sent a message in the last 10 minutes by default
2015-03-08 17:06:16	Ford4385	Ok\
2015-03-08 17:07:08	Yoshi2_	you could try waiting for 10 minutes and see if that is true
2015-03-08 17:09:34	Ford4385	It is
2015-03-08 17:09:36	Ford4385	I know

2015-03-08 17:36:37	Ford4385	Its the dolphin
2015-03-08 17:36:50	Ford4385	I just deleted my comment there

2015-03-08 17:37:19	Ford4385	But the ship in acnl is the dolphin, it only has one seat
2015-03-08 17:37:30	@Espyo	all right, so the Pikmin 2 ship doesn't have an official name
2015-03-08 17:37:34	@Espyo	but
2015-03-08 17:37:49	@Espyo	the US version of Pikmin 3 calls it "Hocotate ship", the same name we have currently
2015-03-08 17:38:06	Ford4385	Pikmin 1 is the S.S. Dolphin
2015-03-08 17:38:10	@Espyo	L3re7z suggests renaming the ship to "Hocotate Freight ship"
2015-03-08 17:38:24	@Espyo	I say no, because that's made up, and Pikmin 3 has one official name, even if it's only on one version of the game
2015-03-08 17:38:32	@Espyo	what do you guys think?
2015-03-08 17:39:05	Ford4385	Maybe. I kinda agree with Hocotate Freight Ship, because Its a ship owned by hocotate freight
2015-03-08 17:39:47	@Espyo	of course, but we'd be using a made-up name, when an official name exists
2015-03-08 17:39:47	Ford4385	It never really is known who the owner is
2015-03-08 17:40:06	Ford4385	But yeah.... Just keep the name "Hocotate ship"
2015-03-08 17:40:29	Ford4385	Also, shouldn't the golden ship be different than "Hocotate ship"
2015-03-08 17:40:42	Ford4385	Because It is stated that the gold one is the presidents ship
2015-03-08 17:43:26	@Espyo	huh?!
2015-03-08 17:43:30	@Espyo	I've never head such a thing
2015-03-08 17:43:50	Ford4385	I remember when I was playing that it stated the gold one was the presidents ship
2015-03-08 17:45:15	Ford4385	Also, it can't be a gold paint job because in pikmin 3 you can see the ship in its normal paint job
2015-03-08 17:49:07	@Espyo	>Then everyone will be gaudily
2015-03-08 17:49:08	@Espyo	clad in gold, like me! ...No.
2015-03-08 17:49:08	@Espyo	I am unique. And beautiful. Yes.
2015-03-08 17:49:14	@Espyo	not sure who says that, but that's one line in Pikmin 2
2015-03-08 17:49:48	@Espyo	that's the only line I can find in the entire script
2015-03-08 17:50:20	Ford4385	I'm pretty sure that they are two seperate ships
2015-03-08 17:56:30	Ford4385	I believe this because since louie returns that means to be canon they would have to gone back to the planet and rescue louie
2015-03-08 17:57:13	Ford4385	And since the ship is gold, then in pikmin 3 its not. I think they are seperate ships
2015-03-08 18:00:10	Ford4385	I mean it is compelling evidence
2015-03-08 18:02:31	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-03-08 18:03:10	@Espyo	though a theory I heard around is that, because the freight had to go under debt again just before Pikmin 3 (which is canon), they might have sold the gold plating to help pay back the loan
2015-03-08 18:03:38	Ford4385	I'm not sure
2015-03-08 18:04:14	Ford4385	I think it the gold was part of the ship, because if they were to have gold plating on the ship, wouldn't that just put them in debt again?
2015-03-08 18:05:22	Ford4385	And we know the president has a ship for himself, because in one of the data files left by olimar, I believe it mentions the president going to a beach

2015-03-08 18:30:09	@Espyo	yeah, you're right
2015-03-08 18:30:19	@Espyo	they're out there working hard, and the president is just chilling in a beach somewhere
2015-03-08 18:30:47	Ford4385	Yep
2015-03-08 18:31:42	Ford4385	So are we going to seperate the two ships? Or copy this stuff down and put it as an idea? Or just keep them together?

2015-03-08 18:32:20	@Espyo	I honestly doubt the normal ship and the golden ship are different
2015-03-08 18:33:28	Ford4385	I think they are. I just gave this evidence I guess you'd call it. Its more speculation than anything
2015-03-08 18:34:09	@Espyo	precisely, it's too speculative
2015-03-08 18:34:21	@Espyo	like, sure, the president can have his own ship
2015-03-08 18:34:35	@Espyo	but nothing points out that it's the golden ship, and that's even implying they're a separate rocket
2015-03-08 18:35:36	Ford4385	Well yes. But its still questionable how it can be gold in pikmin 2 and then be back to normal in pikmin 3
2015-03-08 18:39:47	@Espyo	like I said, they sold it off
2015-03-08 18:40:01	@Espyo	much more logical than having two ships
2015-03-08 18:40:15	@Espyo	if they had a normal ship and a golden one, why didn't they sell the golden one on Pikmin 2 to pay the debt?
2015-03-08 18:40:23	@Espyo	and if it was the president's special ship that he wanted to keep secret
2015-03-08 18:40:32	@Espyo	then why did they suddenly start using it after the debt is repaid?
2015-03-08 18:41:03	Ford4385	I don't know. But if they were to put gold plating, that would surely put them in debt again
2015-03-08 18:41:26	@Espyo	that's also weird
2015-03-08 18:42:02	Ford4385	It can't be because gold isn't worth much on their planet
2015-03-08 18:42:06	Yoshi2	didn't they only drop into debt due to loss of those carrots?
2015-03-08 18:42:13	Ford4385	Yeah
2015-03-08 18:42:15	@Espyo	yep
2015-03-08 18:42:27	Ford4385	*cough cough* Louie *cough cough*
2015-03-08 18:43:10	Ford4385	I like louie as a character, but his life choices are horrible

2015-03-08 18:44:08	@Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4RQFbUzhXw 12:00 have those 3 yellow pellets always been there?
2015-03-08 18:45:03	Ford4385	Pretty sure the answers no
2015-03-08 18:45:38	Ford4385	Because I don't remember them being there
2015-03-08 18:45:44	@Espyo	I'll check later, on another run video, on a non-Japanese version
2015-03-08 18:45:58	Ford4385	There might have been 3 there but more spread out
2015-03-08 18:46:02	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2015-03-08 18:46:08	@Espyo	anyway, watch the full run, as well
2015-03-08 18:46:10	Ford4385	Its just unatural for them to be that close
2015-03-08 18:46:10	@Espyo	it's incredible

2015-03-08 18:46:20	@Espyo	<Ford4385> Its just unatural
2015-03-08 18:46:26	@Espyo	yeah, my thoughts exactly
2015-03-08 18:47:27	Ford4385	And I can tell thats a speedrun or something. The way he took down that bulborb before plucking the yellow pikmin
2015-03-08 18:48:25	@Espyo	yep
2015-03-08 18:48:27	@Espyo	speedrun

2015-03-08 18:49:37	@Espyo	right
2015-03-08 18:50:54	Ford4385	At 12:52 where did he get the bomb-rocks?
2015-03-08 18:53:23	@Espyo	at 12:47, he throws some Pikmin to the bomb-rocks near the gate
2015-03-08 18:53:40	Ford4385	There are bomb-rocks there?
2015-03-08 18:53:49	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-08 18:54:58	Ford4385	That would have been helpful in my playthrough....
2015-03-08 18:55:07	@Espyo	they're the first bombs you get
2015-03-08 18:55:14	@Espyo	they're next to a new type of gate
2015-03-08 18:55:25	@Espyo	to hint to you that they do something related to reinforced walls
2015-03-08 18:55:54	Ford4385	Oh. I just went straight to the left. With the bomb-rocks in a can
2015-03-08 18:59:43	Ford4385	I can tell its tool assisted

2015-03-08 19:36:42	@Espyo	so try like this:
2015-03-08 19:36:46	@Espyo	Testyo: what color of Pikmin is your favorite?

2015-03-08 19:42:26	@Espyo	J: have you noticed that if you put your cursor under "Help", on the sidebar, you get a tooltip with "The place to find out"?
2015-03-08 19:44:35	Ford4385	It does!
2015-03-08 19:45:08	@Espyo	what the hell is up with that?!
2015-03-08 19:45:26	Ford4385	I don't know
2015-03-08 19:45:43	@Espyo	it's not just on this wiki
2015-03-08 19:45:53	@Espyo	can't remember which other one I saw it on, but it's a NIWA one
2015-03-08 19:47:13	Ford4385	Idk
2015-03-08 19:47:20	Ford4385	Its not on Bulbapdia

2015-03-08 19:48:10	@Espyo	Zelda Wiki?
2015-03-08 19:48:18	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/MediaWiki:Common.js should be able to modify it there

2015-03-08 19:48:30	@Espyo	on a .js?
2015-03-08 19:48:32	@Espyo	oh
2015-03-08 19:48:53	@Espyo	in Portuguese, the message is "A place reserved for help."
2015-03-08 19:49:11	@Espyo	let me try other non-wikipedia, non-wikia wikis
2015-03-08 19:49:41	@J	yeah, probably that page was populated with the defaults when we first created it, which would've been years ago
2015-03-08 19:49:44	@Espyo	http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki
2015-03-08 19:49:47	@Espyo	it's a MediaWiki thing
2015-03-08 19:50:00	@Espyo	why is the default such a messed up thing?
2015-03-08 19:50:02	@J	might be worth grabbing the default from a wiki that hasn't changed it and has recent MW
2015-03-08 19:50:04	@Espyo	it's not even a sentence... kinda
2015-03-08 19:50:11	@J	as in, it should be long fixed in MW
2015-03-08 19:50:15	@Espyo	yeah
2015-03-08 19:50:27	@Espyo	but now, to find a MW wiki like that...
2015-03-08 19:50:39	@Espyo	wait, let me try googling the thing
2015-03-08 19:51:21	@J	alternatively, delete the page and check what text is shown
2015-03-08 19:51:26	@J	...no-one'll notice
2015-03-08 19:51:38	@Espyo	probably
2015-03-08 19:52:14	@Espyo	http://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Monobook.js/Wikibooks
2015-03-08 19:53:01	@Espyo	what if we download MW's most recent files and check there?
2015-03-08 19:53:41	@Espyo	I'm on it
2015-03-08 19:56:54	@J	actually...
2015-03-08 19:57:00	@J	what if you just remove all those lines?
2015-03-08 19:57:11	@J	the defaults should be good, right?
2015-03-08 19:58:14	@Espyo	are there defaults?
2015-03-08 20:00:51	@Espyo	...I can't find what I'm looking for in the mediawiki source
2015-03-08 20:09:42	Ford4385	Has anyone seen UltraMario lately?
2015-03-08 20:10:37	@J	well, if you get something different in Portuguese and we don't have Portuguese on the page
2015-03-08 20:10:45	@J	it's very likely it'd do the same for English
2015-03-08 20:11:22	@J	UltraMario left 4 and a half hours ago
2015-03-08 20:11:33	Ford4385	oh

2015-03-08 21:00:42	@Espyo	and that way, he'll even fix it on other NIWA wikis he owns
2015-03-08 21:18:32	@J	did you try removing the lines from the page?

2015-03-08 21:30:59	@Espyo	wonder if stuff would remain in cache, though
2015-03-08 21:32:27	@Espyo	actually...
2015-03-08 21:32:34	@Espyo	aren't we meant to add text to the message?
2015-03-08 21:32:42	@Espyo	"The place to find out about <blank>."
2015-03-08 21:32:45	@Espyo	we fill in the blank
2015-03-08 21:32:55	@Espyo	I think I've seen that in other wikis, when I tried googling the term
2015-03-08 21:34:26	@Espyo	all right, it's either in cache, or the default is the same as the text that's there
2015-03-08 21:34:36	@Espyo	I'll ask Porple, okay?

2015-03-09 23:30:10	@Espyo	oh, sorry
2015-03-09 23:30:11	@Espyo	busy
2015-03-09 23:30:26	@Espyo	you can add a picture anywhere by doing [[File:picturename]]
2015-03-09 23:30:26	Testyo	"File:picturename" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:picturename
2015-03-09 23:30:30	@Espyo	so just do that as a signature
2015-03-09 23:33:47	Ford4385	So in the signature i just put [[File:RedPikmin]] for example?
2015-03-09 23:33:47	Testyo	"File:RedPikmin" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:RedPikmin
2015-03-09 23:34:41	@Espyo	yeah
2015-03-09 23:34:48	@Espyo	well, with the extension
2015-03-09 23:34:53	@Espyo	so [[File:RedPikmin.jpg]]
2015-03-09 23:34:53	Testyo	"File:RedPikmin.jpg" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:RedPikmin.jpg
2015-03-09 23:35:11	Ford4385	Good point
2015-03-09 23:35:26	Ford4385	I should put .jpg at the end

2015-03-09 23:36:01	@Espyo	what about?
2015-03-09 23:37:18	Ford4385	I tried linking to his page as an example, but I don't think I did it right
2015-03-09 23:37:39	Ford4385	Does the Capitalization have to be correct?
2015-03-09 23:39:51	@Espyo	just as any other page
2015-03-09 23:39:55	@Espyo	which for the most part is yes
2015-03-09 23:40:03	@Espyo	except for the first letter after the namespace
2015-03-09 23:40:18	@Espyo	so RedPikmin = redPikmin =/= redpikmin
2015-03-09 23:41:14	Ford4385	I'd have to put say Ford4385 or ford4385 to get to my userpage? Or just caps
2015-03-09 23:42:47	Ford4385	[[User:Ford4385]]
2015-03-09 23:42:48	Testyo	"User:Ford4385" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Ford4385

2015-03-12 22:56:40	Ford4385	Whats an RSS aggregator?
2015-03-12 22:58:27	@Espyo	a thing that saves RSS feed news
2015-03-12 22:59:43	Ford4385	And I have no clue what that is
2015-03-12 23:00:24	@Espyo	you know how some pages post news articles
2015-03-12 23:00:27	@Espyo	or comics post new comics
2015-03-12 23:00:31	@Espyo	they can create RSS feeds
2015-03-12 23:00:49	@Espyo	and instead of going to their page to check new articles, comics, etc.
2015-03-12 23:01:02	@Espyo	you just have a program reed the RSS feed and list all news from all sites in a single place
2015-03-12 23:01:53	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-12 23:02:00	Ford4385	So kinda like an auto updater
2015-03-12 23:02:27	@Espyo	yeah
2015-03-12 23:02:32	@Espyo	well, it SHOULD be auto
2015-03-12 23:02:40	@Espyo	one of the ones I used doesn't even auto-fetch
2015-03-12 23:02:56	Ford4385	From what I can tell, it should do that
2015-03-12 23:03:45	@Espyo	yeah, it should...

2015-03-13 10:30:01	Ford4385	Hi
2015-03-13 10:31:27	Yoshi2	morning
2015-03-13 10:35:29	Ford4385	How are you?
2015-03-13 10:36:37	Yoshi2	alright
2015-03-13 10:37:49	Ford4385	I'm good/fabulous
2015-03-13 10:43:39	Yoshi2	how many percent fabulous are you compared to good?
2015-03-13 10:44:27	Ford4385	 78/22
2015-03-13 10:45:55	Yoshi2	how high was your fabulousness yesterday?
2015-03-13 10:50:19	Ford4385	About 86
2015-03-13 10:57:11	Yoshi2	in three to four days your fabulous:good ratio will be exactly 50:50
2015-03-13 10:57:22	Yoshi2	in almost 10 days you will be 0% fabulous, and 100% good
2015-03-13 10:58:29	Yoshi2	in roughly three months your fabulousness will be at -642%, and you will be 742% good
2015-03-13 10:59:22	Ford4385	Who says it keeps going down?
2015-03-13 10:59:28	Ford4385	It just varies between days
2015-03-13 10:59:45	Ford4385	There is no positive or negative linear association
2015-03-13 11:00:17	Yoshi2	but it is much easier to work with linear mathematical functions
2015-03-13 11:00:50	Ford4385	Well, explain why the day before yesterday how I was a 73
2015-03-13 11:02:09	Ford4385	Whats your linear equations gotta say to that?
2015-03-13 11:03:10	Yoshi2	that could be explained with a quadratic function
2015-03-13 11:04:14	Yoshi2	now, if you had a fourth value that didn't fit my quadratic function, then I'd have trouble coming up with new functions
2015-03-13 11:05:51	Ford4385	I just know that the data ranges from 70-100
2015-03-13 11:10:20	Yoshi2	in that case the sinus function would be necessary to describe that change
2015-03-13 11:10:42	Ford4385	Ok That sounds interesting
2015-03-13 11:10:54	Yoshi2	85 + 15*sin(x)
2015-03-13 11:11:01	Yoshi2	always stays in the 70-100 range
2015-03-13 11:11:53	Ford4385	Ok cool
2015-03-13 11:13:19	Yoshi2	but yeah, you can't really describe something like that with a simple maths function
2015-03-13 11:13:32	Yoshi2	it can only be estimated by using a lot of data points
2015-03-13 11:16:00	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-13 11:16:19	Ford4385	See if you can figure it out by the time I get back (In like 7 hours)
2015-03-13 11:16:27	Ford4385	So have fun and bye
2015-03-13 11:16:30	Ford4385	or not do it

2015-03-14 14:45:09	Ford4385	Just a question Espyo do you happen to know where I can buy pikmin cheap?
2015-03-14 14:45:25	Waterpikmin	amazon may be a good place
2015-03-14 14:45:29	Waterpikmin	just saying
2015-03-14 14:47:36	Ford4385	Apparently if you want to buy pikmin new for the gamecube it costs $125 dollars
2015-03-14 14:47:36	Testyo	$ 125 = 92.15 â¬ / Â£ 78.8125 
2015-03-14 14:47:58	Ford4385	I just realized I put the currency twice
2015-03-14 14:50:55	Waterpikmin	i would get used
2015-03-14 14:51:12	Waterpikmin	i have it cheap because i still have mine from like launch so
2015-03-14 14:52:45	Ford4385	Yeah, used is like $22
2015-03-14 14:52:45	Testyo	$ 22 = 16.2184 â¬ / Â£ 13.871 
2015-03-14 14:54:05	Ford4385	A good condition collectible one is only $25
2015-03-14 14:54:09	Testyo	$ 25 = 18.43 â¬ / Â£ 15.7625 
2015-03-14 14:54:46	Ford4385	testyo lm 1
2015-03-14 14:54:50	Testyo	I said $ 25 = 18.43 â¬ / Â£ 15.7625  because Ford4385 mentioned the number 25 and the unit $, so I converted it.
2015-03-14 14:54:57	Ford4385	Oh ok

2015-03-14 21:07:53	@Espyo	hey, do you have the manual for US Pikmin 2 on the GameCube?

2015-03-14 21:08:16	@PikFan	why?
2015-03-14 21:08:18	@Espyo	can you check the page explaining the dots on the radar?
2015-03-14 21:08:30	@Espyo	some months ago, I saw a picture of a P2 manual
2015-03-14 21:08:40	@Espyo	with a red, yellow, cyan, white, uh...
2015-03-14 21:08:42	@Espyo	something else
2015-03-14 21:08:45	@Espyo	and then pink dot
2015-03-14 21:08:53	@Espyo	which doesn't match the final colors
2015-03-14 21:09:01	@Espyo	 2 days ago, somebody reposted it on the skype chat
2015-03-14 21:09:08	@Espyo	...the link to the image died in the mean time for some reason
2015-03-14 21:09:14	@Espyo	but anyway, we need to figure what where that comes from

2015-03-15 21:02:21	Ford4385	I?
2015-03-15 21:04:07	Yoshi2	the imaginary unit i has the property iÂ² = -1
2015-03-15 21:04:25	Ford4385	Im talking for real
2015-03-15 21:04:32	Yoshi2	whenever you want to know the square root of a negative number, you're dealing with imaginary numbers
2015-03-15 21:04:50	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number
2015-03-15 21:05:34	Ford4385	A real square root of a negative
2015-03-15 21:06:28	Ford4385	What about the square root of a red pikmin?
2015-03-15 21:07:12	Yoshi2	if we discard the idea of imaginary numbers, then you could say that a negative number does not have a square root
2015-03-15 21:08:10	Ford4385	ok
2015-03-15 21:08:21	Ford4385	But what about the square root of red pikmin?
2015-03-15 21:08:52	Yoshi2	depends on how you define red pikmin
2015-03-15 21:09:53	Ford4385	A red pikmin
2015-03-15 21:11:13	Yoshi2	you can't define it recursively like that
2015-03-15 21:12:33	Ford4385	The first red pikmin olimar discovers. Leaf
2015-03-15 21:13:54	Yoshi2	what do you get when you multiply a red pikmin with a red pikmin?
2015-03-15 21:14:12	Yoshi2	is there something that, multiplied with itself, results in a red pikmin?
2015-03-15 21:14:46	Ford4385	A red pikmin with a red pikmin would make a red pikmin
2015-03-15 21:15:04	Ford4385	Cause the two would carry a pellet back to the onion
2015-03-15 21:15:09	Ford4385	and make another seed
2015-03-15 21:15:52	Yoshi2	there ya go
2015-03-15 21:16:00	Yoshi2	the red pikmin is the square root of the red pikmin
2015-03-15 21:17:12	Ford4385	But a red and a yellow can make a red
2015-03-15 21:17:15	Ford4385	and red and blue
2015-03-15 21:17:21	Ford4385	And a purple and purple can make
2015-03-15 21:17:22	Ford4385	red
2015-03-15 21:17:52	Ford4385	And  a white and white can make a red
2015-03-15 21:18:00	Ford4385	and red and anything
2015-03-15 21:18:21	Yoshi2	that means the type of the pikmin being created does not depend on the type of the pikmin who carry the seed
2015-03-15 21:18:33	Ford4385	Yes it does

2015-03-16 23:12:44	@PikFan	*right
2015-03-16 23:12:45	@PikFan	...
2015-03-16 23:13:06	@Espyo	hi again
2015-03-16 23:13:11	@Espyo	hehe
2015-03-16 23:13:34	@Espyo	you'll make it through
2015-03-16 23:13:43	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-03-16 23:13:56	@PikFan	...like I've been for the past 10+ years
2015-03-16 23:14:15	@PikFan	though who am I to complain, you went through college and trying to find a job
2015-03-16 23:15:21	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-03-16 23:15:27	@PikFan	there was something else I had in mind
2015-03-16 23:16:06	@PikFan	so say you're a person who plays the Pikmin series, and you're struggling with something
2015-03-16 23:16:21	@PikFan	you go onto the wiki to look it up, but it's missing
2015-03-16 23:16:30	@PikFan	what do you do?
2015-03-16 23:16:43	@Espyo	(one sec)
2015-03-16 23:16:58	@PikFan	we should make a community page called Requests
2015-03-16 23:17:23	@PikFan	so if something is missing, you can request for it to be added, if it's reasonable
2015-03-16 23:17:42	@PikFan	anybody can requestâeven anons
2015-03-16 23:18:37	@Espyo	"trying to find a job"?
2015-03-16 23:18:57	@PikFan	I thought you were looking for a job still?
2015-03-16 23:19:04	@Espyo	if you're wiki-savvy, you can just write it on the talk page for the main page
2015-03-16 23:19:10	@Espyo	no, I've had a job since november
2015-03-16 23:19:15	@PikFan	...oh
2015-03-16 23:19:46	@PikFan	>if you're wiki-savvy
2015-03-16 23:20:03	@PikFan	that's the thing, this is meant for users who don't know their way around wikis

2015-03-16 23:22:13	@Espyo	I guess the chatroom
2015-03-16 23:22:15	@Espyo	if they notice it
2015-03-16 23:22:18	@Espyo	there's no good way, I don't think
2015-03-16 23:22:52	@Espyo	even for the page
2015-03-16 23:22:55	@Espyo	people would have to know about it
2015-03-16 23:23:02	@Espyo	it would be kind of the same thing as the chatroom
2015-03-16 23:23:20	@PikFan	true
2015-03-16 23:23:28	@Espyo	plus you have to be just as wiki-savvy to edit the main page's talk as to edit a requests page
2015-03-16 23:23:49	@Espyo	except I just pointed out the main page as wiki-savvy because... it's kind of the "standard"?

2015-03-17 19:48:09	@PikFan	so I started standardizing the notes, but on the notes pages the category isn't appearing

2015-03-17 19:49:27	Testyo	the 'infobox' part doesn't actually matter since you could use it elsewhere if you need to buy one more

2015-03-19 19:29:09	@Espyo	very
2015-03-19 19:29:13	@Espyo	but it can never NOT be hard
2015-03-19 19:29:31	@PikFan	should we split it, one per region? might be easier
2015-03-19 19:29:45	@Espyo	but it could be pretty redundant too
2015-03-19 19:29:50	@PikFan	true
2015-03-19 19:30:10	@PikFan	perhaps there could be some way to show or hide them
2015-03-19 19:30:24	@Espyo	hmm
2015-03-19 19:30:36	@Espyo	there'd always be ways
2015-03-19 19:30:38	@Espyo	javascript magic
2015-03-19 19:30:50	@PikFan	can't you change the visibility of a column?
2015-03-19 19:31:13	@Espyo	uhm, I think so
2015-03-19 19:31:23	@PikFan	I see
2015-03-19 19:31:29	@Espyo	but that wouldn't be enough
2015-03-19 19:31:42	@Espyo	'cause the other region's treasures would still appear
2015-03-19 19:31:57	@Espyo	you could just sort the relevant region's column
2015-03-19 19:32:01	@Espyo	numbers would appear in order
2015-03-19 19:32:05	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-19 19:32:06	@Espyo	and then the ---s at the bottom
2015-03-19 19:32:27	@PikFan	...the /what/?
2015-03-19 19:33:35	@Espyo	---
2015-03-19 19:33:51	@Espyo	"numbers" of treasures that don't appear in that column's region :|
2015-03-19 19:34:48	@PikFan	oh, I was seeing it as one giant line, but I realized it was a dash and a hyphen
2015-03-19 19:35:08	@PikFan	so I was confused
2015-03-19 19:36:17	@PikFan	also, the todo on [[Mock Bottom]] says it might be a transcription error, but I'm pretty sure Brittany writes that first sentence again
2015-03-19 19:36:18	Testyo	"Mock_Bottom" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Mock_Bottom
2015-03-19 19:36:22	@PikFan	I'll check
2015-03-19 19:37:20	@Espyo	heh
2015-03-19 19:38:02	@Espyo	please do
2015-03-19 19:38:04	@Espyo	how weird
2015-03-19 19:38:09	@PikFan	I should probably check all of the American notes to see if there're any other transcription errors
2015-03-19 19:38:11	@Espyo	wonder if it's a typo from Nintendo's side then
2015-03-19 19:38:17	@Espyo	or if they MEANT to have her repeat
2015-03-19 19:38:22	@Espyo	you /definitely/ should
2015-03-19 19:38:26	@PikFan	latter, probably
2015-03-19 19:38:33	@Espyo	I mean, they came from wikia, 'nuff said
2015-03-19 19:38:44	@PikFan	I think they wanted it to be a full circle sort of thing
2015-03-19 19:41:15	@PikFan	oh, so last night I googled "fan game engine", and your engine was like the sixth result
2015-03-19 19:42:17	@PikFan	speaking of, what's this "really complicated stage"?
2015-03-19 19:45:22	@Espyo	I get that, but it's so bad
2015-03-19 19:45:26	@Espyo	hah, amazing!
2015-03-19 19:45:30	@Espyo	the enemy scripting
2015-03-19 19:45:46	@Espyo	basically, the scripting worked like "when the enemy sees a Pikmin, go chase it"
2015-03-19 19:45:56	@Espyo	that's pretty much what you wrote in the files
2015-03-19 19:46:04	@Espyo	except... it had problems
2015-03-19 19:46:16	@Espyo	what if the enemy, say, a Bulborb, saw a Pikmin while sleeping?
2015-03-19 19:46:21	@Espyo	you wouldn't want it to chase it
2015-03-19 19:46:24	@Espyo	you'd want it to ignore it
2015-03-19 19:46:32	@Espyo	you'd only want it to chase the Pikmin if the Pikmin TOUCHES it
2015-03-19 19:46:50	@Espyo	so I had to rework the whole system to fit those states, too
2015-03-19 19:47:02	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-19 19:47:06	@Espyo	and I took the chance to make the Pikmin and leaders' logic work under that system too
2015-03-19 19:47:13	@Espyo	but it's so complex to implement...
2015-03-19 19:47:18	@Espyo	but at least it's going okay now
2015-03-19 19:47:25	@Espyo	I know how to structure my code to make it work and everything
2015-03-19 19:47:28	@PikFan	that's good
2015-03-19 19:47:33	@Espyo	but for MONTHS, I couldn't wrap my head around how to do it
2015-03-19 19:47:40	@Espyo	heck, I didn't even know what the "it" was
2015-03-19 19:47:50	@Espyo	I just knew the old scripting method was bad, and I needed something else
2015-03-19 19:47:58	@Espyo	can't wait to get this to work and to FINALLY move on to new stuff, like menus
2015-03-19 19:48:06	@PikFan	there needs to be an engine to make engines
2015-03-19 19:48:15	@PikFan	or at least a template
2015-03-19 19:48:51	@Espyo	when will the meta end

2015-03-19 19:51:37	@Espyo	haven't asked yet

2015-03-21 12:43:19	Testyo	that's why I made the icon!
2015-03-21 12:46:09	@Espyo	hi
2015-03-21 12:46:16	@Espyo	...Testyo made the icon so that he could be greeted
2015-03-21 12:46:16	Testyo	I believe that's I'm moving 40+ Pikmin with me
2015-03-21 12:46:30	@Espyo	check the number on the HUD, Testyo
2015-03-21 12:46:31	Testyo	I'm sitting here and regretting staying to hear the solutions to the South
2015-03-21 12:46:40	@Espyo	spoilers will do that
2015-03-21 12:55:45	@J	hi
2015-03-21 12:55:48	@J	just woke up?
2015-03-21 12:56:30	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-21 12:56:32	@Espyo	and hi
2015-03-21 12:56:41	@Espyo	really wanted to be energized today, to work on the engine
2015-03-21 12:57:10	Yoshi2	I've had a lot of fun working on my new IRC bot
2015-03-21 12:57:39	Yoshi2	on the other hand though, progress on the bms stuff halted almost completely
2015-03-21 12:58:18	@J	I accidentally woke up around 6 and couldn't get back to sleep
2015-03-21 12:58:30	@J	Yoshi2: you're making an IRC bot too?
2015-03-21 12:59:19	Yoshi2	J: who else is making one?
2015-03-21 13:00:14	@Espyo	ouch, J
2015-03-21 13:00:22	@Espyo	if I wake up around one hour before time, that's it
2015-03-21 13:00:24	@Espyo	but 6? no way
2015-03-21 13:00:50	Yoshi2	I have made one already, but the code of that bot makes me cringe
2015-03-21 13:02:07	Yoshi2	to be expected, considering that it is two years old
2015-03-21 13:04:42	@J	Testyo is a bot, right?
2015-03-21 13:04:42	Testyo	No.
2015-03-21 13:04:45	@J	oh
2015-03-21 13:05:12	Yoshi2	testyo is not a bot
2015-03-21 13:05:12	Testyo	and I couldn't call back boom
2015-03-21 13:07:15	Yoshi2	old main loop: https://github.com/RenolY2/Renol-IRC/blob/master/IRCbot.py#L89
2015-03-21 13:07:19	Yoshi2	new main loop: https://github.com/RenolY2/Renol-IRC-rv2/blob/master/irc_bot.py#L27
2015-03-21 13:07:30	@J	well now I feel silly
2015-03-21 13:09:16	Yoshi2	still a long way to go until the new bot can do everything the old bot does
2015-03-21 13:15:56	Yoshi2	I'm using yaml for the config file now, and I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to keep the order of the keys when saving the config file again
2015-03-21 13:16:52	@J	what's with your variable casing
2015-03-21 13:16:59	@J	I am very sad
2015-03-21 13:17:17	Yoshi2	how so?
2015-03-21 13:17:25	@J	it's very inconsistent
2015-03-21 13:17:33	@J	randomly snake case/camel case/title case
2015-03-21 13:17:56	@J	anyway, you should start using Python 3 instead
2015-03-21 13:17:59	Yoshi2	if you mean the old code, I want to punch my old self too
2015-03-21 13:18:10	@Espyo	<J> randomly snake case/camel case/title case
2015-03-21 13:18:22	Yoshi2	but in the new code I've been putting more effort in keeping variable names consistent
2015-03-21 13:18:26	@Espyo	that's my life now
2015-03-21 13:18:31	@Espyo	the code at my company is like that
2015-03-21 13:18:45	@Espyo	it's like watching fireworks that cause a seizure
2015-03-21 13:19:34	@J	ours is pretty good at work except for config files
2015-03-21 13:19:52	@J	they're mostly JSON, so keys can even have dashes
2015-03-21 13:20:16	@J	[13:18:22] Yoshi2 but in the new code I've been putting more effort in keeping variable names consistent
2015-03-21 13:20:22	@J	I am still disappointed
2015-03-21 13:20:26	Yoshi2	:<
2015-03-21 13:20:46	@J	well, now lunch
2015-03-21 13:21:57	Yoshi2	objects are CamelCase, variables and functions are lower_case
2015-03-21 13:28:57	Yoshi2	so if you have found some specific places in which the variable naming seems inconsistent, I'd take a look at that
2015-03-21 13:30:28	@Espyo	any code I write at home is ALWAYS lower_case
2015-03-21 13:30:36	@Espyo	not very pretty, but never inconsistent
2015-03-21 13:30:38	@Espyo	oh, I lie
2015-03-21 13:30:42	@Espyo	constants are CAPS
2015-03-21 13:30:57	@Espyo	to my defense, it's the way Allergro uses it
2015-03-21 13:31:05	@Espyo	and the founding fathers of C++
2015-03-21 13:31:41	Yoshi2	not too long ago I read through the entire PEP8, and I've been trying to make my new code more PEP8-like
2015-03-21 13:32:16	@Espyo	I read through that for ideas for my company's coding standard
2015-03-21 13:32:18	@Espyo	which never took flight
2015-03-21 13:33:25	Yoshi2	one aspect of PEP8 I cannot get behind is the 79 character limit per line
2015-03-21 13:33:52	Yoshi2	not having insanely long lines seems reasonable, but 79 characters is far too low for me
2015-03-21 13:35:17	@Espyo	mhm, same
2015-03-21 13:35:30	@Espyo	and why something so arbitrary as 79?
2015-03-21 13:35:33	@Espyo	do they give a reason?
2015-03-21 13:36:40	Yoshi2	I think it was because of the width limit in terminals
2015-03-21 13:37:03	@Espyo	hm
2015-03-21 13:37:12	@Espyo	but that's legacy
2015-03-21 13:37:19	Yoshi2	I'm probably wrong
2015-03-21 13:38:09	Yoshi2	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length
2015-03-21 13:38:16	Yoshi2	"The limits are chosen to avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, [...]"
2015-03-21 13:38:44	@Espyo	"you know, a common thing"
2015-03-21 13:39:06	@Espyo	"specially nowadays, that monitors can span over a thousand pixels in width"
2015-03-21 13:39:12	Yoshi2	yup
2015-03-21 13:39:21	@Espyo	because somebody wants to limit themselves with a tiny window, that doesn't mean the rest of the world has to conform
2015-03-21 13:39:23	@Espyo	that's ridiculous
2015-03-21 13:39:39	@Espyo	sure, maybe you want several windows open, and the coding window has to conform to 80 characters
2015-03-21 13:40:02	@Espyo	but when your unlikely decision forces other people to have to rethink their code just to make a line shorter, that's when I draw the line
2015-03-21 13:40:11	@Espyo	not to mention that it could risk making code LESS readable just for the sake of it
2015-03-21 13:40:24	Yoshi2	yup
2015-03-21 13:40:30	@Espyo	I have some code that spans a single line, and it's perfectly fine to read it in the single line
2015-03-21 13:40:40	@Espyo	breaking it in several would just make it seem longer and more drawn-out than it is
2015-03-21 13:40:49	@Espyo	that's the problem with standards
2015-03-21 13:40:56	@Espyo	there are flaws, somebody else tries a new standard to fix the flaws
2015-03-21 13:40:59	@Espyo	and now we have one more standard
2015-03-21 13:41:02	Yoshi2	I think somewhere at the start of the PEP8 it says that it is just an recommendation
2015-03-21 13:41:15	@Espyo	hm, makes sense
2015-03-21 13:41:18	Yoshi2	they know following PEP8 word for word is insanity
2015-03-21 13:41:19	@Espyo	not like they could force people, anyway
2015-03-21 13:43:00	Yoshi2	theoretically, they could build PEP8 checking directly into python
2015-03-21 13:43:17	@J	IRCNetworking, MyConfig, self.ReadThread, etc. are wrong then
2015-03-21 13:43:28	Yoshi2	J: wut
2015-03-21 13:43:37	@Espyo	Yoshi2: your code
2015-03-21 13:43:40	@Espyo	consistency
2015-03-21 13:43:42	@J	80 is good because then you can view 3 columns side by side
2015-03-21 13:43:46	@J	for merges
2015-03-21 13:44:09	@Espyo	it's still a pretty limited set of situations
2015-03-21 13:44:28	@J	merges are common with multiple developers
2015-03-21 13:44:29	@Espyo	why not make all lines span 1 character because somebody could have a broken left/right key, and working up/down keys?
2015-03-21 13:44:47	@Espyo	they are, but again, warping your head around your code just to make it 80
2015-03-21 13:44:51	@J	at work I do a merge probably once a week or more often
2015-03-21 13:44:51	@Espyo	it just causes more harm than good IMO
2015-03-21 13:44:57	@Espyo	plus what's the problem with auto word wrap?
2015-03-21 13:45:11	@Espyo	brb, lunch
2015-03-21 13:45:21	@J	if someone's ever written an auto-word-wrap for code that stays readable, let me know
2015-03-21 13:46:14	@J	but yeah, I would say around 100 characters is a fair limit - beyond that lines can get unreadably long
2015-03-21 13:48:16	Yoshi2	maybe I just interpreted this part incorrectly: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names
2015-03-21 13:50:45	@J	yeah, probably, those aren't classes
2015-03-21 13:51:14	@J	a class name is the name you use after the 'class' keyword, and that's it
2015-03-21 13:51:27	Yoshi2	they aren't classes, but I thought that if the classes are CamelCase, then why shouldn't the instances of those classes be CamelCase too?
2015-03-21 13:51:44	@J	because everything is an instance of a class
2015-03-21 13:52:04	@J	a class is a 'type' instance
2015-03-21 13:52:06	Yoshi2	fair enough
2015-03-21 13:53:08	Yoshi2	but that means that almost everything is lower_case /o\
2015-03-21 13:53:50	@J	yeah
2015-03-21 13:53:58	@J	easier to type
2015-03-21 13:54:05	@J	well...expect for the _
2015-03-21 13:54:22	@J	I think that's easier on a US keyboard though
2015-03-21 13:54:54	Yoshi2	Shift and -
2015-03-21 13:57:21	@J	yeah, I mean I think it's where my ' is
2015-03-21 13:57:22	@J	maybe?
2015-03-21 13:57:24	@J	too lazy to check
2015-03-21 13:57:28	@J	near enter
2015-03-21 13:59:59	Yoshi2	on my German keyboard I can push it fairly easily with my right hand

2015-03-21 17:55:37	@J	I may be crazy: I'm looking into using Ansible to manage my local configuration files and scripts for multiple machines
2015-03-21 17:56:01	@J	idea being I git clone my repo then run a script, and it puts all the correct config files in the right place based on the machine
2015-03-21 17:56:21	@Espyo	doesn't really sound crazy
2015-03-21 17:56:42	@J	eg. only personal machines want the youtube shell aliases
2015-03-21 17:57:06	@J	and VMs don't want to set -j makeflag
2015-03-21 17:58:00	@Espyo	what in the world are you doing that it involves git, youtube and VMs?
2015-03-21 17:58:16	@J	I said my local config files
2015-03-21 17:58:32	@J	as in bashrc, ~/bin...
2015-03-21 17:58:56	@J	.vimrc
2015-03-21 17:59:29	@J	so I have a git repository containing the Ansible definitions
2015-03-21 17:59:40	@J	clone it on each computer I use, run the script to generate configs
2015-03-21 17:59:49	@Espyo	oh
2015-03-21 18:00:02	@J	and the computer might be a VM

2015-03-21 19:44:04	Ford4385	Hallo
2015-03-21 19:44:16	@Espyo	hey
2015-03-21 19:44:52	Ford4385	is there anything I can do related to pikmin 3 that requires almost no skill?
2015-03-21 19:45:44	@Espyo	[[Category:Articles in need of Pikmin 3 help]]

2015-03-21 19:45:48	@Espyo	that really is the best way to check
2015-03-21 19:46:09	Yoshi2	basic writing skills are recommended
2015-03-21 19:47:32	Ford4385	Obviously
2015-03-21 19:48:00	Ford4385	I mean like no skill of getting things, or taking pictures
2015-03-21 19:49:20	Yoshi2	what do you mean with getting things?
2015-03-21 19:50:09	Ford4385	I mean like glitches, or pictures of certain fruits that I might have already collected
2015-03-21 19:50:18	Ford4385	Because I can't do either
2015-03-21 19:54:48	Yoshi2	taking pictures is not too difficult, you just need to find a website that supports uploading pictures from the Wii U browser
2015-03-21 19:56:47	Yoshi2	and I think it is possible to look at all the fruits you have already collected, unless you want to take a picture of the fruit while it is still in the level
2015-03-21 20:02:07	Ford4385	I forgot the Koppad had a camera feature
2015-03-21 20:02:40	Ford4385	I can upload to Miiverse, go to the miiverse website, download the image, and upload to the wiki
2015-03-21 20:04:11	Yoshi2	there are ways to do it without Miiverse, but that works too
2015-03-21 20:06:50	Ford4385	I dont know
2015-03-21 20:07:42	Yoshi2	well, do you want to know?
2015-03-21 20:19:38	Ford4385	Not really. It probably uses money. Which I have none of
2015-03-21 20:23:25	Yoshi2	I'm not aware of any such service that uses money
2015-03-21 20:24:26	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-21 20:24:53	Yoshi2	you really just need an image hoster that also works in the wii u browser
2015-03-21 20:25:27	Ford4385	ok
2015-03-21 20:28:21	Yoshi2	I didn't have much success with imgur.com, but postimage.org worked
2015-03-21 20:28:50	Yoshi2	the downside is that you need to remember the url of the image you uploaded
2015-03-21 20:29:32	Yoshi2	unless you register an account on that website, which I didn't do

2015-03-22 16:41:27	@Espyo	I thought the TASvideos thread said that Dolphin still didn't have accurate loading times
2015-03-22 16:41:30	@Espyo	making the oob trick impossible

2015-03-22 16:44:20	Miles	Dolphin's still a bit faster than it should be but it's much better than it was in the past

2015-03-22 17:31:37	Ford4385	Or something like that
2015-03-22 17:32:10	@Espyo	the wiki should say all locations

2015-03-22 17:32:38	Ford4385	We can find out [[Calcified Crushblat]]

2015-03-22 17:33:20	@Espyo	ah right
2015-03-22 17:33:47	Ford4385	Its says its in the tropical wilds, but it doesn't say where.
2015-03-22 17:34:08	Ford4385	And since it only appears once in story, it should say where.
2015-03-22 17:35:02	@Espyo	that's why we're trying to make every article have a "locations" section
2015-03-22 17:35:28	Yoshi2_	hmm, should't it be close to the ship's location?
2015-03-22 17:36:09	@Espyo	it's not
2015-03-22 17:37:57	Ford4385	Apparently you shouldnt fight armored cannon larvae uphill with blues
2015-03-22 17:44:15	Ford4385	Can you throw bomb rock pikmin, and not have them drop the bombs?

2015-03-22 17:44:56	Ford4385	*not

2015-03-22 17:47:36	Ford4385	I needed to know, so I could get bombrocks up a ledge

2015-03-22 18:17:58	@Espyo	depends on the game
2015-03-22 18:18:28	Ford4385	I was playing pikmin 3
2015-03-22 18:34:20	@Espyo	not in Pikmin 3, no
2015-03-22 18:42:52	Ford4385	I found that out by almost killing my army
2015-03-22 18:49:55	@Espyo	hehe
2015-03-22 18:54:17	Ford4385	Almost
2015-03-22 19:09:26	Ford4385	Espyo, is there a page for like tips and stuff for new players.
2015-03-22 19:09:44	Ford4385	New to the games, not the wiki
2015-03-22 19:10:23	@Espyo	we had it, but it never really went anywhere, and was disorganized
2015-03-22 19:10:40	@Espyo	right now, the closest thing is just finding the subject you need help on and reading the article
2015-03-22 19:10:42	@Espyo	but general tips, no
2015-03-22 19:10:56	@Espyo	though we have articles on a lot of things, like whistling and such
2015-03-22 19:13:47	Ford4385	Maybe there should be one
2015-03-22 19:15:58	@Espyo	yeah, but there are two problems
2015-03-22 19:16:02	@Espyo	for one thing, what would we really add?
2015-03-22 19:16:09	@Espyo	second, we're not a strategy guide
2015-03-22 19:16:12	@Espyo	having guides in articles, that's okay
2015-03-22 19:16:20	@Espyo	but going out of our way to create guide-like articles...
2015-03-22 19:16:25	@Espyo	I mean, we have some, mostly for speedruns
2015-03-22 19:16:30	@Espyo	but those are a bit more "set in stone"
2015-03-22 19:16:40	@Espyo	so they have some encyclopedic value
2015-03-22 19:16:53	@Espyo	we could just create one on the Guides: namespace
2015-03-22 19:16:59	@Espyo	but still, what would we have there?
2015-03-22 19:18:53	Yoshi2	I'm sure a lot of other people have already written guides about pikmin 3

2015-03-24 19:02:20	@PikFan	a few days ago I decided to record myself playing Pikmin 2 with my iPad
2015-03-24 19:02:33	@PikFan	...I never knew how loud I mashed my buttons
2015-03-24 19:04:49	@PikFan	playing Pikmin 3 again
2015-03-24 19:04:59	@PikFan	trying a 14 day run
2015-03-24 19:05:08	@PikFan	15 days is my best

2015-03-24 19:15:40	@Espyo	hehe
2015-03-24 19:15:48	@Espyo	some gameplay videos have really loud controller clacking, yeah
2015-03-24 19:16:12	@PikFan	I need to get a capture card
2015-03-24 19:16:17	@PikFan	but moneeeeeeeeey
2015-03-24 19:17:10	@Espyo	yep

2015-03-24 19:17:31	@PikFan	I need to get those corpses for yellow Pikmin
2015-03-24 19:18:35	@PikFan	...how weird
2015-03-24 19:19:08	@PikFan	you know that stump in the Distant Tundra with the Dapper Blob on it?
2015-03-24 19:19:38	@PikFan	I had Brittany standing right next to it, tried to Go here! to the Drake
2015-03-24 19:19:50	@PikFan	and the path went right through the stump
2015-03-24 19:19:55	@PikFan	she wasn't even on it
2015-03-24 19:23:40	Yoshi2	my dream has always been to get a decent capture card

2015-03-24 19:27:46	@Espyo	I don't recall the stump
2015-03-24 19:28:18	@PikFan	it's next to the pot with the Burgeoning Spiderwort
2015-03-24 19:28:33	@Espyo	next to a bamboo gate?
2015-03-24 19:28:53	@PikFan	yeah
2015-03-24 19:30:21	@Espyo	how weird
2015-03-24 19:30:24	@Espyo	hmmmm
2015-03-24 19:30:28	@Espyo	we should add that to the wiki some time
2015-03-24 19:30:56	@PikFan	probably because you can throw leaders onto the stump
2015-03-24 19:31:22	@Espyo	I'm not really visualizing it
2015-03-24 19:31:32	@Espyo	but I'll put it on my TODO to take a closer look when I next start the game
2015-03-24 19:31:36	@Espyo	oh, I got the short movies, btw
2015-03-24 19:32:12	@PikFan	nice
2015-03-24 19:32:18	@PikFan	do you like them?
2015-03-24 19:32:35	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-24 19:32:37	@Espyo	they're so charming
2015-03-24 19:32:39	@Espyo	dammit, I love 'em
2015-03-24 19:32:52	@PikFan	indeed
2015-03-24 19:32:59	@PikFan	they should make more of them
2015-03-24 19:33:24	@Espyo	I thought that all throughout
2015-03-24 19:33:43	@PikFan	THIS stump: http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/e/ef/Dapper_Blob_Distant_Tundra.jpg
2015-03-24 19:34:39	@Espyo	right, I was thinking that one
2015-03-24 19:34:44	@Espyo	but then you said you could throw leaders at it
2015-03-24 19:34:49	@Espyo	and I figured it couldn't be
2015-03-24 19:34:53	@PikFan	that ramp to the left
2015-03-24 19:35:03	@Espyo	isn't it slidey?
2015-03-24 19:35:13	@PikFan	I don't think so, no
2015-03-24 19:35:29	@PikFan	I think it's the one to the right
2015-03-24 19:35:48	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-03-24 19:35:48	@PikFan	anyway, Brittany was standing next to the edge of the ramp
2015-03-24 19:36:09	@PikFan	game must've thought she was on the ramp
2015-03-24 19:36:47	UltraMario	hi pikfan

2015-03-24 19:37:13	UltraMario	o
2015-03-24 19:37:24	@PikFan	I did, but I never play it
2015-03-24 19:38:06	@PikFan	it's just not my thing
2015-03-24 19:38:22	UltraMario	;-;
2015-03-24 19:38:46	@PikFan	I tried it, but things went horribly
2015-03-24 19:39:00	@PikFan	why are there so many combinations
2015-03-24 19:39:20	@Espyo	it's meant to
2015-03-24 19:39:28	@Espyo	you need to start off easy, though
2015-03-24 19:39:33	@Espyo	no items, pick just one character
2015-03-24 19:39:35	@Espyo	and just use them
2015-03-24 19:39:41	@Espyo	just see what inputs do what
2015-03-24 19:39:47	@Espyo	and you'll start getting the core of the game
2015-03-24 19:39:49	@Espyo	after that, just explore
2015-03-24 19:39:56	@Espyo	and remember that this game isn't meant to be taken seriously
2015-03-24 19:39:58	@PikFan	right, I was doing that
2015-03-24 19:40:01	@PikFan	but
2015-03-24 19:40:05	@PikFan	complicated
2015-03-24 19:40:11	@Espyo	like, the goal of the game really is to just have everybody flying everywhere with explosions and items

2015-03-26 19:49:46	@PikFan	hi
2015-03-26 19:50:00	@PikFan	so I decided to read more chat logs last night
2015-03-26 19:50:20	@PikFan	then it was 4:30 am
2015-03-26 19:50:36	@PikFan	maybe I shouldn't read chat logs at night
2015-03-26 19:51:21	@PikFan	I did come across me throwing meat and fruit over J to try to revive him, though
2015-03-26 19:51:32	@PikFan	but I forgot marshmallows and I died
2015-03-26 19:51:45	@Espyo	hi
2015-03-26 19:51:51	@Espyo	maybe you shouldn't, really
2015-03-26 19:52:08	@Espyo	you sure that wasn't an exhaustion-enduced dream?
2015-03-26 19:52:21	@PikFan	no, that was actually a thing
2015-03-26 19:52:43	@PikFan	we got into an argument over J's "vegetarian" status
2015-03-26 19:52:46	@PikFan	again
2015-03-26 19:53:13	@Espyo	hah
2015-03-26 19:53:15	@Espyo	I remember that
2015-03-26 19:53:32	@PikFan	*induced
2015-03-26 19:53:59	@PikFan	anyway, it was bad
2015-03-26 19:54:30	@Espyo	that
2015-03-26 19:55:02	@PikFan	I have to say, MK8's online waiting room music is amazing
2015-03-26 19:56:31	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2015-03-26 19:56:38	@PikFan	...apparently Safari can't remember user pages
2015-03-26 19:57:16	@Espyo	can't remember user pages?
2015-03-26 19:57:18	@Espyo	bookmarks?
2015-03-26 19:57:49	@PikFan	it'll remember pages in the main space
2015-03-26 19:57:56	@PikFan	*mainspace
2015-03-26 19:58:11	@PikFan	but for some reason it ignores the userspace

2015-03-26 20:06:35	@PikFan	the heck, Mibbit
2015-03-26 20:06:54	@PikFan	I disconnected and it logged me out >_>
2015-03-26 20:08:08	Yoshi2	should it not log you out?
2015-03-26 20:08:25	@PikFan	yeah
2015-03-26 20:09:02	@PikFan	usually when I disconnect (or quit in general) I'm still logged in when I return
2015-03-26 20:09:47	Yoshi2	in what way are you logged in?
2015-03-26 20:09:53	Yoshi2	authenticated on the IRC server?
2015-03-26 20:10:03	@PikFan	Mibbit account
2015-03-26 20:10:09	Yoshi2	ah
2015-03-26 20:10:15	Yoshi2	then I have no idea
2015-03-26 20:10:20	@PikFan	you don't need one to chat, but it is easier
2015-03-26 20:10:39	@PikFan	probably something to do with the iPad
2015-03-26 20:10:41	Yoshi2	is it for storing settings?
2015-03-26 20:10:56	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-03-26 20:11:57	Yoshi2	I'm not sure what the pros of having a mibbit account are
2015-03-26 20:12:39	@PikFan	it lets you autojoin channels so you don't have to manually join each channel each time
2015-03-26 20:12:50	@PikFan	also preferences
2015-03-26 20:12:53	Yoshi2	so it is for storing settings
2015-03-26 20:13:00	@PikFan	oh
2015-03-26 20:13:20	@PikFan	I didn't quite understand what you meant
2015-03-26 20:13:30	@PikFan	but I see now
2015-03-26 20:14:11	Yoshi2	I suppose that's nice for if you are using different devices to go on IRC
2015-03-26 20:14:48	@PikFan	it is
2015-03-26 20:14:56	@PikFan	works best on a laptop
2015-03-26 20:15:17	@PikFan	more shaky on other devices
2015-03-26 20:15:48	@PikFan	imagine using IRC on a 3DS
2015-03-26 20:15:55	@PikFan	it was very frustrating
2015-03-26 20:16:06	Yoshi2	I used IRC on a DSi
2015-03-26 20:16:09	@PikFan	I'd get kicked off very often
2015-03-26 20:16:11	Yoshi2	I was suprised it even worked
2015-03-26 20:16:21	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-03-26 20:16:53	@PikFan	...the DSi had internet?
2015-03-26 20:17:00	@PikFan	you learn something every day
2015-03-26 20:17:50	Yoshi2	there was an internet browser for the original DS, it used a GBA cartridge because the DS didn't have enough memory
2015-03-26 20:18:06	Yoshi2	the DSi had improved hardware and a built-in browser
2015-03-26 20:18:15	@PikFan	huh

2015-03-26 20:19:57	Yoshi2	the main issue with using the browser on the wii u and the 3ds is that the chat tab always needs to be focused, I think
2015-03-26 20:20:00	@PikFan	...I need to disable autocorrect
2015-03-26 20:20:17	@PikFan	same with iPad
2015-03-26 20:20:21	Yoshi2	if it isn't, the client stops running and you will eventually disconnect
2015-03-26 20:20:28	@PikFan	yeah
2015-03-26 20:20:40	@PikFan	can't stay in another tab for very long
2015-03-26 20:20:56	@PikFan	iirc the 3DS doesn't even have tabs
2015-03-26 20:21:08	Yoshi2	I use a dedicated client on my phone
2015-03-26 20:21:16	@PikFan	I see

2015-03-26 20:25:37	@Espyo	heh
2015-03-26 20:25:48	@PikFan	don't we just love these shenanigans?

2015-03-26 20:27:34	@PikFan	2014-07-19 00:40:41     @Espyo  but it would be better than having 2 people that discuss programming, games, and food
2015-03-26 20:27:40	@PikFan	best quote ever
2015-03-26 20:27:57	Yoshi2	what is wrong with discussing programming, games and food?
2015-03-26 20:28:07	@PikFan	nothing
2015-03-26 20:28:26	@Espyo	but whatever it was, it was better
2015-03-26 20:28:50	Yoshi2	there are few things better than discussing programming, games and food
2015-03-26 20:29:18	@PikFan	it's pretty much what we talk about all the time
2015-03-26 20:29:31	@PikFan	...well, I might be lying
2015-03-26 20:29:45	@PikFan	really what we talk about is trivial stuff
2015-03-26 20:29:48	@PikFan	like this
2015-03-26 20:30:01	@PikFan	then hints of programming, games, and food
2015-03-26 20:30:04	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-26 20:30:23	Yoshi2	if anything, we don't talk enough about programming, games and food
2015-03-26 20:30:27	@Espyo	also about how Miles is insane http://www.twitch.tv/milessmb/c/5007143
2015-03-26 20:30:32	@PikFan	indeed
2015-03-26 20:30:37	@PikFan	what did he do now?
2015-03-26 20:30:49	@Espyo	played the first two Metroid Primes WITH ONE CONTROLLER
2015-03-26 20:30:58	@Espyo	I couldn't watch the whole thing, but from the description, he was close
2015-03-26 20:31:07	Yoshi2	at once?
2015-03-26 20:31:09	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-03-26 20:31:28	@Espyo	at the same time
2015-03-26 20:31:30	@Espyo	same inputs
2015-03-26 20:32:06	@PikFan	...he played both games at once using one controller...?!
2015-03-26 20:32:12	@PikFan	wow
2015-03-26 20:35:15	@PikFan	how is that even possible
2015-03-26 20:35:20	@Espyo	modded controller, I think
2015-03-26 20:35:29	@PikFan	hm
2015-03-26 20:35:51	@Espyo	or emulator
2015-03-26 20:37:40	@PikFan	err, why do I get the feeling that guy on fanon made a sockpuppet
2015-03-26 20:37:47	@Espyo	heh, probablyy
2015-03-26 20:37:49	@Espyo	*-y
2015-03-26 20:38:04	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-26 20:38:20	@PikFan	I'll check their IPs
2015-03-26 20:41:49	@PikFan	aaaaaaaaand fanon is trying to crash on me
2015-03-26 20:44:25	@PikFan	yep, they do
2015-03-26 20:45:06	@PikFan	I should say something but checking their IPs was tough
2015-03-26 20:45:27	@PikFan	it was really slow
2015-03-26 20:45:36	@PikFan	also got logged out
2015-03-26 20:46:11	@Espyo	hmm
2015-03-26 20:46:17	@Espyo	has fanon been acting fine besides that, lately?
2015-03-26 20:46:31	@PikFan	still slow as ever
2015-03-26 20:46:44	@PikFan	sometimes I get the fatal error page
2015-03-26 20:47:15	@PikFan	...was the background ever fixed?
2015-03-26 20:49:07	@Espyo	don't think so
2015-03-26 20:49:09	@Espyo	nor the slowness
2015-03-26 20:49:10	@Espyo	darn
2015-03-26 20:49:39	@PikFan	hm
2015-03-26 20:51:12	Yoshi2	Espyo: damn, playing two games with one controller looks pretty impressive
2015-03-26 20:51:20	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-26 20:51:26	@Espyo	I've seen TASes of it
2015-03-26 20:51:30	@Espyo	they're also impressive
2015-03-26 20:51:33	@Espyo	but this is a first in real-time, for me
2015-03-26 20:53:22	Yoshi2	looks like he uses the environment to make Samus be stuck in the place in the first game while he progresses with the second game game, and vice versa
2015-03-26 20:54:09	@PikFan	I figured as much
2015-03-26 20:54:39	Yoshi2	though he also uses cutscenes
2015-03-26 20:54:52	Yoshi2	it's not like Samus is stuck in the same place for a long time
2015-03-26 20:54:55	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-26 20:55:02	@PikFan	interesting
2015-03-26 20:55:06	Yoshi2	there is quite a lot of moving around in both games
2015-03-26 20:55:37	@PikFan	wonder what'd happen if someone did that with P1 and 2
2015-03-26 20:56:09	Yoshi2	peace be upon the one who attempts to do that with the Pikmin games
2015-03-26 20:56:26	Yoshi2	because I do not see that going too well
2015-03-26 20:56:39	@PikFan	*cough*Miles*cough*
2015-03-26 20:56:45	@PikFan	heh
2015-03-26 20:56:49	@PikFan	indeed
2015-03-26 21:01:18	@Espyo	maybe it could
2015-03-26 21:01:28	@Espyo	at the very least if you were patient and brought one Pikmin with you at a time
2015-03-26 21:01:32	@Espyo	but Pikmin 1's time limit...
2015-03-26 21:02:54	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-03-26 21:03:15	@PikFan	the two games' conflicting natures would make it hard
2015-03-26 21:03:29	@Espyo	well, that's what I thought about the Primes
2015-03-26 21:03:31	@Espyo	but still...
2015-03-26 21:03:52	@PikFan	also the caves
2015-03-26 21:04:15	@Espyo	right
2015-03-26 21:04:35	@PikFan	heck, he might be forced to finish P1 before 2
2015-03-26 21:04:47	@PikFan	but it's Miles
2015-03-26 21:04:49	@Espyo	heh, I can imagine now
2015-03-26 21:04:57	@PikFan	he could figure something out
2015-03-26 21:05:01	@PikFan	he always does
2015-03-26 21:05:07	@Espyo	some tryhard "yo wad up everybody, I'm gonna play both Pikmin games with the same controller at the same time! WOOOOOOOOOAAAAHHHHH!!!"
2015-03-26 21:05:15	@Espyo	and then he just plays through Pikmin
2015-03-26 21:05:22	@Espyo	letting whatever happens on Pikmin 2 happen
2015-03-26 21:05:29	@Espyo	and when he completes Pikmin, goes to 2
2015-03-26 21:05:34	@PikFan	oh deer

2015-03-26 21:06:38	@PikFan	why must there be so many idiots everywhere
2015-03-26 21:06:46	Yoshi2	yeah, there is really little difficulty in making one game be stuck at the same spot forever while you play through the other game
2015-03-26 21:07:07	Yoshi2	trying to advance both games at the same time makes things much more difficult
2015-03-26 21:07:39	@PikFan	but you are allowed to let one game "pause" for a moment while you do something in the other, yes?
2015-03-26 21:07:58	Yoshi2	probably
2015-03-26 21:08:25	@PikFan	hmm...

2015-03-27 21:07:39	@PikFan	I wonder what will happen to the wiki this year...
2015-03-27 21:08:11	@PikFan	(reading stuff about the merge)
2015-03-27 21:09:12	@Espyo	we'll finish the merge

2015-03-27 21:09:16	@PikFan	ooh, forgot to finish standardizing/checking the notes
2015-03-27 21:09:21	@PikFan	should do that sometime
2015-03-27 21:09:22	@Espyo	and just find more juicy game-file-related info
2015-03-27 21:09:25	@Espyo	you should

2015-03-27 21:09:43	@PikFan	alright
2015-03-27 21:10:10	@PikFan	have you made any progress with editing P2's game files?

2015-03-27 21:11:35	@PikFan	was reading a log about changing the limit of max Pikmin
2015-03-27 21:11:49	@PikFan	also music
2015-03-27 21:12:02	@PikFan	ah, memories
2015-03-27 21:12:32	@PikFan	hmm... I wonder if it'd be worth my while to learn how to access the game's files
2015-03-27 21:12:59	@PikFan	but since we have people who know how to do that it might be pointless
2015-03-27 21:15:23	@PikFan	gaaaaaah
2015-03-27 21:15:39	@PikFan	I really wish I had a working laptop
2015-03-27 21:16:54	@PikFan	then I could edit on the wikis again
2015-03-27 21:17:15	@PikFan	...I still need to update my game
2015-03-27 21:17:29	@PikFan	I never fully implemented that revised game order
2015-03-27 21:17:50	@PikFan	speaking of, I never figured out how to make it non linear
2015-03-27 21:18:03	@PikFan	there's a lot of things that I haven't done yet

2015-03-27 21:24:04	Miles	"Possible explanation: During an early version of the game, the log text was a certain way, and during that time, the script that plays the tapping sound was made to match that text. Before the final release, some words were removed from the text, making it appear faster, but the sound scripting was never adjusted, following the slower speed of the old text."

2015-03-27 21:38:54	@Espyo	biggest reason is not enough interest
2015-03-27 21:39:00	@Espyo	it's not hard
2015-03-27 21:39:10	@Espyo	I'm waiting for J to finish his cross-platform ISO editor
2015-03-27 21:39:44	@PikFan	so it can edit the ISO of all the games?
2015-03-27 21:40:00	@Espyo	Miles: in my defense, the summary for that change was "...We need to double check this. My memory's hazy."
2015-03-27 21:40:15	@Espyo	as I was finishing it, I was even having second thoughts about how the glitch even was
2015-03-27 21:40:25	@Espyo	it's just a mess
2015-03-27 21:40:35	@Espyo	then I tried finding videos, and surprise surprise, it doesn't happen in any video I saw
2015-03-27 21:40:51	@Espyo	PikFan: you can already, with some tools, but almost nothing allows you to increase the final size of the ISO
2015-03-27 21:41:06	@Espyo	J's old tool does, but it's pretty huge
2015-03-27 21:41:08	@Espyo	...and volatile
2015-03-27 21:41:11	@Espyo	let's not forget volatile
2015-03-27 21:41:16	@Espyo	seriously, you try to move the window, it crashes
2015-03-27 21:42:35	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-27 21:43:02	@Espyo	but anyway, it's easy, if you have the game and an emulator
2015-03-27 21:43:09	@Espyo	you use Dolphin to take out the files
2015-03-27 21:43:16	@Espyo	or the same program that edits the ISOs, really
2015-03-27 21:43:28	@Espyo	you unpack them using some tools; that's where the meat of the tutorial will be
2015-03-27 21:43:32	@Espyo	you edit the text files
2015-03-27 21:43:43	@Espyo	...probably with Notepad++, otherwise Notepad might mess up the encoding
2015-03-27 21:43:50	@Espyo	and then repack them, again, with a tutorial
2015-03-27 21:43:56	@Espyo	and put them back in the game with the ISO editor
2015-03-27 21:43:59	@Espyo	then run that through Dolphin
2015-03-27 21:44:01	@Espyo	and it works
2015-03-27 21:46:03	@PikFan	that's basically the same thing you explained to me last summer
2015-03-27 21:46:15	@PikFan	with the .szs and .rarc files
2015-03-27 21:46:55	@Espyo	yep
2015-03-27 21:46:59	@Espyo	has it been that long?
2015-03-27 21:47:01	@Espyo	time flies...
2015-03-27 21:47:18	@PikFan	it does
2015-03-27 21:47:45	@PikFan	if you were going at the speed of light time would fly faster
2015-03-27 21:47:50	@PikFan	yay science
2015-03-27 21:48:14	@Espyo	it would
2015-03-27 21:51:17	@J	Espyo: I thought you managed to get Dolphin to read directly from extracted files?
2015-03-27 21:51:33	@Espyo	oh, that thing
2015-03-27 21:51:36	@Espyo	I sure tried, but...
2015-03-27 21:51:41	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure it didn't work
2015-03-27 21:52:28	@J	shame
2015-03-27 21:52:34	@J	what's this about a tutorial?
2015-03-27 21:52:53	@Espyo	I was going to write something to help others pack, unpack, extract, edit, etc. the P2 files
2015-03-27 21:53:02	@Espyo	I wrote something really complex, that was more of a tool list showcase
2015-03-27 21:53:06	@Espyo	instead of a proper tutorial
2015-03-27 21:53:21	@Espyo	you helped me decide to revert all that and just go with an actual tutorial with actual tools
2015-03-27 21:53:24	@J	yeah, I remember that
2015-03-27 21:53:29	@J	okay
2015-03-27 21:53:45	@J	well, sadly I've not done much programming outside of work lately
2015-03-27 21:53:48	@J	too lazy
2015-03-27 21:53:53	@J	I'll try to get back into it
2015-03-27 21:54:09	@Espyo	of course
2015-03-27 21:54:14	@Espyo	I live that every day too
2015-03-27 21:54:15	@Espyo	ah engine...
2015-03-27 21:54:24	@Espyo	I promise I'll work tomorrow, I will
2015-03-27 21:54:30	@Espyo	...I might only do it for an hour, but I will

2015-03-27 22:01:12	Miles	[17:51:15] <@J> Espyo: I thought you managed to get Dolphin to read directly from extracted files?
2015-03-27 22:01:23	Miles	Dolphin has issues doing that with PAL games and I have no clue how to fix it
2015-03-27 22:01:29	@Espyo	ah, that was it
2015-03-27 22:01:36	@Espyo	they've been doing some development lately
2015-03-27 22:01:39	@Espyo	strong development
2015-03-27 22:01:48	@Espyo	on facebook, at least once a month, they post a huge update post
2015-03-27 22:01:52	@Espyo	pretty pleasant to read
2015-03-27 22:02:03	@Espyo	but I haven't really read anything about extracted files
2015-03-27 22:02:34	Miles	It's posted on their website
2015-03-27 22:02:40	Miles	And I guess copy it to Facebook after that
2015-03-27 22:03:14	@Espyo	hm, I mis-said a bit
2015-03-27 22:03:21	@Espyo	they post a LINK to the news update on their site, on facebook
2015-03-27 22:03:25	@Espyo	that's what I meant
2015-03-27 22:03:30	@Espyo	anyway, moving on...
2015-03-27 22:03:47	@Espyo	I always imagined the Dolphin scene to slowly and steadily grow, but with real features once every half-year or something
2015-03-27 22:03:52	@Espyo	but these updates... they're incredible

2015-03-28 12:57:24	Yoshi2	the game uses the only method available to it to sit here until the third of october

2015-03-28 13:01:48	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2015-03-28 13:01:49	Testyo	I said so all you're saying is 'the game probably uses the only methods available to it to sit here 'til October 3rd now because Yoshi2 mentioned my name.

2015-03-28 15:31:54	Yoshi2	good afternoon
2015-03-28 15:32:18	@PikFan	so I went insane last night
2015-03-28 15:32:50	Ford4385	Morning Pikfan
2015-03-28 15:33:06	@PikFan	because in the apartment complex I live in there's a bunch of stoner kids
2015-03-28 15:33:15	@PikFan	most of them younger than me, sadly
2015-03-28 15:33:31	Ford4385	Thats pretty bad'
2015-03-28 15:33:42	@PikFan	but the real sad thing is one of them is SMARTER than me
2015-03-28 15:33:52	Yoshi2	how so?
2015-03-28 15:33:55	@PikFan	I don't even understand how that's possible
2015-03-28 15:34:09	@PikFan	we happened to be discussing physics
2015-03-28 15:34:37	@PikFan	and throughout he was all like "I know" and he was even trying to argue with me
2015-03-28 15:34:58	@Espyo	hi
2015-03-28 15:35:00	@PikFan	specifically we were discussing general relativity
2015-03-28 15:35:09	Ford4385	Hey espyo
2015-03-28 15:35:13	@PikFan	hi
2015-03-28 15:35:26	@Espyo	he might've just been stoned and thought he knew
2015-03-28 15:35:34	@Espyo	did he say anything else other than "I know"?
2015-03-28 15:35:35	Ford4385	Yeah thats true
2015-03-28 15:35:51	@PikFan	well, he seemed pretty sober
2015-03-28 15:36:13	@PikFan	like I said, he tried to argue against me
2015-03-28 15:36:30	@Espyo	hmm
2015-03-28 15:36:37	@PikFan	...oh, and then we watched part of a horror movie
2015-03-28 15:36:51	Ford4385	Hey Espyo, is the wiki going to do anything for April Fools Day?
2015-03-28 15:37:05	@Espyo	maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaye
2015-03-28 15:37:06	@Espyo	*be
2015-03-28 15:37:08	@PikFan	in which part of the skull was cut out to relieve pressure on this guys brain
2015-03-28 15:37:23	@PikFan	*guy's
2015-03-28 15:37:32	@Espyo	lolwut
2015-03-28 15:37:44	Ford4385	I think we should do something for April Fools Day.
2015-03-28 15:37:50	@PikFan	and I never knew there was a layer of "skin" between the brain and the skull
2015-03-28 15:38:11	Ford4385	Cause Bulbapedia always does stuff, like being taken over by team rocket. So maybe you guys can
2015-03-28 15:38:21	@PikFan	ooh
2015-03-28 15:38:25	@Espyo	no worries, we've got something already
2015-03-28 15:38:51	@PikFan	enlighten me
2015-03-28 15:38:58	Ford4385	Yes please
2015-03-28 15:39:04	Yoshi2	too many people knowing about it ruins the joke
2015-03-28 15:39:05	@Espyo	but that'd ruin the surprise
2015-03-28 15:39:08	@Espyo	yeah
2015-03-28 15:39:10	@PikFan	true
2015-03-28 15:39:14	Ford4385	True
2015-03-28 15:39:17	@Espyo	it won't be mean, just funny
2015-03-28 15:39:56	@PikFan	anyway, I was disappointed, which turned into depression, which turned into a mental breakdown
2015-03-28 15:40:23	Ford4385	I don't know why, but I was thinking that one year someone should put rickroll in the background throughout the entire wiki
2015-03-28 15:40:24	@PikFan	the fact that I watched a horror movie did not help
2015-03-28 15:40:55	@PikFan	rickroll went out of fashion years ago
2015-03-28 15:40:58	Yoshi2	the rickroll joke died down, it seems
2015-03-28 15:41:02	@Espyo	which wiki was that?
2015-03-28 15:41:03	@PikFan	...didn't it?
2015-03-28 15:41:07	@Espyo	yeah, pretty much dead
2015-03-28 15:41:25	Yoshi2	it doesn't help that some firm tried to take down the rickroll song on youtube
2015-03-28 15:41:32	@PikFan	hah
2015-03-28 15:41:36	Ford4385	I mean its a legit song
2015-03-28 15:41:46	Ford4385	Never gonna give you up by rick astley
2015-03-28 15:41:47	Yoshi2	all songs are legit songs

2015-03-28 15:53:08	@PikFan	mm
2015-03-28 15:53:15	Yoshi2	I'm also in a small community that used to be about Zelda, but nowadays it is about everyday stuff
2015-03-28 15:53:27	@PikFan	I see
2015-03-28 15:53:28	Ford4385	Did you say zelda?
2015-03-28 15:53:31	Yoshi2	no
2015-03-28 15:53:33	Yoshi2	I did not say zelda
2015-03-28 15:53:45	Yoshi2	that's just part of your imagination
2015-03-28 15:53:49	@PikFan	quick, hide
2015-03-28 15:53:54	@PikFan	he's onto you
2015-03-28 15:53:58	Ford4385	<Yoshi2>: I'm also in a small community that used to be about Zelda, but nowadays it is about everyday stuff

2015-03-28 15:54:18	Yoshi2	damnit
2015-03-28 15:54:25	Yoshi2	my lie was discovered

2015-03-28 15:55:36	Ford4385	*saturday
2015-03-28 15:55:42	Yoshi2	Ford4385: is there something you wanted to say about Zelda?
2015-03-28 15:55:42	@PikFan	let
2015-03-28 15:55:49	@PikFan	*lel
2015-03-28 15:56:06	Yoshi2	otherwise, I'm not sure why you would ask if I said Zelda when I did say Zelda
2015-03-28 15:56:10	Ford4385	I love Zelda series
2015-03-28 15:56:20	Ford4385	*the Zelda series
2015-03-28 15:56:23	Yoshi2	me too
2015-03-28 15:56:43	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure by now I played the majority of the Zelda games at least once
2015-03-28 15:56:52	@PikFan	ooh, I didn't know both of you were Zelda fans
2015-03-28 15:57:04	Yoshi2	not all finished though
2015-03-28 15:57:09	@PikFan	ok so I have Hyrule Warriors...
2015-03-28 15:57:17	Ford4385	I want HW
2015-03-28 15:57:24	Yoshi2	PikFan: are there Pikmin fans that aren't Zelda fans?
2015-03-28 15:57:30	@PikFan	...and the Boss Pack DLC is considerably difficult
2015-03-28 15:57:43	Ford4385	Probably
2015-03-28 15:57:49	Ford4385	Two seperate fanbases
2015-03-28 15:57:53	@PikFan	they're just insane
2015-03-28 15:58:03	@PikFan	but isn't everybody
2015-03-28 15:58:13	Ford4385	In their own way
2015-03-28 15:58:21	@PikFan	yep
2015-03-28 15:58:56	@PikFan	I'm writing a Zelda fanfic that takes place after Skyward Sword
2015-03-28 15:59:04	Ford4385	I'm actually playing MM3D now
2015-03-28 16:00:06	@PikFan	for some reason my iPad wants to autocorrect Zelda as "ZELDA"
2015-03-28 16:00:10	@PikFan	no clue why
2015-03-28 16:00:13	@Espyo	heh
2015-03-28 16:00:21	@PikFan	brb while I disable AC
2015-03-28 16:00:24	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-28 16:01:36	@PikFan	alright
2015-03-28 16:02:03	@PikFan	lets se if it autocorects mi speling
2015-03-28 16:02:09	@PikFan	ok, good
2015-03-28 16:02:10	Ford4385	I guess not
2015-03-28 16:04:59	Ford4385	Now I'm playing Pokemon
2015-03-28 16:05:35	@PikFan	still in bed
2015-03-28 16:05:46	@PikFan	too lazy to get up

2015-03-28 16:07:20	@PikFan	oh, so I guess that one guy on fanon decide to make a third account
2015-03-28 16:07:21	Ford4385	Thats cool
2015-03-28 16:07:42	Ford4385	And 3 accounts for the same person?
2015-03-28 16:07:42	@PikFan	I asked him why
2015-03-28 16:07:51	Ford4385	What did he say?
2015-03-28 16:08:08	@PikFan	idk, haven't checked yet
2015-03-28 16:08:24	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@u-78-94-868-36.hsd6.or.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)

2015-03-28 16:10:14	@PikFan	I was in another tab for 2 seconds and it decides to disconnect on me -_-
2015-03-28 16:10:15	Ford4385	Lol
2015-03-28 16:10:32	@PikFan	also it logged me out AGAIN
2015-03-28 16:11:01	Ford4385	Thats cool
2015-03-28 16:11:02	Yoshi2_	if the browser keeps every tab active, you shouldn't have any issues
2015-03-28 16:11:25	Yoshi2_	but browsers on tablets probably don't do that
2015-03-28 16:11:26	@PikFan	but it doesn't
2015-03-28 16:11:32	@PikFan	yeah
2015-03-28 16:11:49	@PikFan	if I go to another tab it usually reloads
2015-03-28 16:12:06	@PikFan	ooooooh
2015-03-28 16:12:13	@PikFan	I had a great idea
2015-03-28 16:12:17	@PikFan	brb
2015-03-28 16:14:27	@PikFan	back
2015-03-28 16:14:32	Testyo	hi they're always helpful
2015-03-28 16:14:40	Ford4385	Testyo lm 1
2015-03-28 16:14:41	Testyo	I said hi they're always helpful because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages hi and also added examples, they're always helpful.
2015-03-28 16:14:49	@PikFan	lol
2015-03-28 16:15:06	@PikFan	so I'll use my iPad for mibbit
2015-03-28 16:15:19	@PikFan	and the Wii U for other stuff
2015-03-28 16:15:30	Ford4385	Smart idea
2015-03-28 16:16:23	@Espyo	wait, how in the world do we have a screenshot for one of the Pikmin drawings on the Formidable Oak
2015-03-28 16:16:25	@Espyo	but not know where it is
2015-03-28 16:16:38	@PikFan	...what
2015-03-28 16:16:47	Ford4385	Which Pikmin Drawing?
2015-03-28 16:16:51	@PikFan	oh boy
2015-03-28 16:16:51	@Espyo	hang on, I'm cleaning the drawings page
2015-03-28 16:16:53	@Espyo	let me submit
2015-03-28 16:16:57	Ford4385	[[Formidable Oak]]
2015-03-28 16:16:58	Testyo	"Formidable_Oak" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Formidable_Oak
2015-03-28 16:17:04	@Espyo	also, the Twilight River has two, whereas the others have three
2015-03-28 16:17:10	@Espyo	how can we be sure we didn't just miss the third one?
2015-03-28 16:17:26	@Espyo	there we go
2015-03-28 16:17:28	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_drawings#Formidable_Oak (warning, spoilers
2015-03-28 16:17:30	@Espyo	*)
2015-03-28 16:17:55	Ford4385	Answer: Because of logic
2015-03-28 16:18:03	@Espyo	no doubt
2015-03-28 16:18:48	Ford4385	Someone probably took the picture, but forgot where it was at
2015-03-28 16:19:18	@Espyo	yeah
2015-03-28 16:20:37	Ford4385	I'll see if I can find out
2015-03-28 16:20:59	@Espyo	good luck
2015-03-28 16:21:05	@Espyo	check walls and floors that look like that texture
2015-03-28 16:21:33	Ford4385	Well, on the [[Formidable Oak]] it says "On a rock inside the Plasm Wraith arena." under the Pikmin Drawings section
2015-03-28 16:21:33	Testyo	"Formidable_Oak" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Formidable_Oak
2015-03-28 16:22:18	Ford4385	And the drawings page has that too, but under the swimming pikmin drawing
2015-03-28 16:23:20	@PikFan	[[KopPad#Content]]
2015-03-28 16:23:20	Testyo	"KopPad#Content" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=KopPad#Content
2015-03-28 16:23:27	@Espyo	right, but that's not the one
2015-03-28 16:23:43	@Espyo	wait
2015-03-28 16:23:44	@Espyo	yes it is
2015-03-28 16:23:44	@PikFan	no, this is another issue
2015-03-28 16:23:46	@Espyo	what a mess
2015-03-28 16:23:57	@PikFan	wait what?
2015-03-28 16:24:23	@Espyo	the formidable oak page and the drawings page contradict each other
2015-03-28 16:24:24	Ford4385	The formidable oak page has the locations of the drawings
2015-03-28 16:24:45	Ford4385	They probably mixed it up
2015-03-28 16:24:49	@PikFan	"Upon collecting 10 fruits, the Fruit Finder will be unlocked."
2015-03-28 16:25:09	@PikFan	uh, is Fruit Finder an actual thing or did somebody make that up
2015-03-28 16:25:31	@Espyo	...?
2015-03-28 16:25:34	@Espyo	you know
2015-03-28 16:25:39	Ford4385	I don't know if it has an actual name
2015-03-28 16:25:40	@PikFan	I've never heard of Fruit Finder
2015-03-28 16:25:54	@Espyo	before the fruit finder, you only see icons of fruits on the KopPad when you actually see the fruit
2015-03-28 16:26:02	@Espyo	with the Fruit Finder, the icons appear at all times
2015-03-28 16:26:12	@Espyo	the name might only exist on the European version, but I know I saw it
2015-03-28 16:26:14	@Espyo	I think
2015-03-28 16:26:18	Ford4385	Maybe
2015-03-28 16:26:28	@PikFan	I know that, I've just never heard of it
2015-03-28 16:26:48	Ford4385	I havent either
2015-03-28 16:26:50	@PikFan	I'll check the notes
2015-03-28 16:27:17	@Espyo	uhm guys
2015-03-28 16:27:19	@Espyo	real quick
2015-03-28 16:27:21	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_drawings
2015-03-28 16:27:22	Ford4385	What?
2015-03-28 16:27:24	@Espyo	this page
2015-03-28 16:27:31	@Espyo	it used to have bullet points and galleries to list the drawings
2015-03-28 16:27:35	@Espyo	I changed it to tables, right?
2015-03-28 16:27:36	@PikFan	...oh, I guess it IS a thing
2015-03-28 16:27:45	@Espyo	do any of you see the tables as being HORRIBLY disproportionate?
2015-03-28 16:27:46	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-03-28 16:27:58	Ford4385	Oh god they are
2015-03-28 16:28:03	@Espyo	like the Distant Tundra table having MASSIVE "Drawing", "Depiction" and "Location" cells?
2015-03-28 16:28:04	@Espyo	HOW?!
2015-03-28 16:28:14	@Espyo	what in the WORLD
2015-03-28 16:28:16	Ford4385	Yeah, whats up with that
2015-03-28 16:28:29	@Espyo	I made the cells with the actual drawing info all have 250px width
2015-03-28 16:28:38	@Espyo	and now somehow the title cells are all messed up?
2015-03-28 16:28:41	@Espyo	DAMMIT, CSS
2015-03-28 16:28:47	@Espyo	even when you work well, you still don't work well
2015-03-28 16:28:49	@Espyo	let me try chrome
2015-03-28 16:28:56	@PikFan	err, it looks okay for me on Wii U
2015-03-28 16:29:04	@Espyo	it's fine for me on firefox
2015-03-28 16:29:11	Ford4385	It looks horrible for me on chrome
2015-03-28 16:29:40	@PikFan	also fine on iPad
2015-03-28 16:29:58	@Espyo	it's horrible for me on chrome
2015-03-28 16:30:15	Ford4385	Yeah. I think just chrome
2015-03-28 16:30:16	@PikFan	speaking of disproportionate things, the main page goes outside of the margins on iPad and Wii U
2015-03-28 16:30:23	@Espyo	...
2015-03-28 16:30:26	@Espyo	I'll check on my Wii U
2015-03-28 16:30:30	@Espyo	but it's fine on my iPad
2015-03-28 16:30:30	Ford4385	Most wikis are on Ipad/Wii u
2015-03-28 16:30:34	Ford4385	Atleast for me
2015-03-28 16:30:37	@Espyo	I fixed it some weeks ago
2015-03-28 16:30:48	@PikFan	wait, you did?
2015-03-28 16:31:02	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmm
2015-03-28 16:31:33	@PikFan	oh, never mind
2015-03-28 16:31:47	@Espyo	well, never minding the messed up drawing page
2015-03-28 16:31:53	@PikFan	I'm crazy then
2015-03-28 16:31:56	@Espyo	Ford4385: did you confirm all of the Formidable Oak locations yet?
2015-03-28 16:32:31	Ford4385	No, I need to raise pikmin before I go to the Formidable oak. I only have like 10 reds
2015-03-28 16:32:45	Ford4385	Actually about 40
2015-03-28 16:33:46	Ford4385	I'll put it on my Todo list
2015-03-28 16:34:24	Ford4385	Did you see the question I asked on [[Talk:Spacesuit Upgrades]]
2015-03-28 16:34:24	Testyo	"Talk:Spacesuit_Upgrades" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Spacesuit_Upgrades
2015-03-28 16:34:41	Ford4385	Oops did that wrong
2015-03-28 16:35:08	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-03-28 16:35:25	@PikFan	so I did the Tropical Wilds in 1 day
2015-03-28 16:35:37	Ford4385	Wow
2015-03-28 16:35:48	@Espyo	I haven't yet, but I saw that you wrote a question
2015-03-28 16:35:52	@PikFan	now I'm working on a strategy for the Twilight River
2015-03-28 16:36:18	@Espyo	...what the fuck
2015-03-28 16:36:19	Testyo	You swear like a sailor.
2015-03-28 16:36:25	@Espyo	okay, first of all
2015-03-28 16:36:30	@Espyo	I'm turning Testyo's complaint rate to 0
2015-03-28 16:36:31	Testyo	...just not with the argument only removes game icons, it's called 'noicons'; for those that do other things too, it's 'clash'
2015-03-28 16:36:35	@Espyo	looks like it's 100% now, good grief
2015-03-28 16:36:36	@Espyo	second...
2015-03-28 16:36:44	@Espyo	I added a FIXED width for the header cells too
2015-03-28 16:36:46	@Espyo	and what does chrome do now?
2015-03-28 16:36:47	@PikFan	lol
2015-03-28 16:36:52	@Espyo	it IGNORES the fixed width on the actual drawing cells
2015-03-28 16:36:56	@Espyo	now THOSE are all inconsistent
2015-03-28 16:37:01	@Espyo	I swear I have no idea what's going on
2015-03-28 16:37:02	@Espyo	J?
2015-03-28 16:37:38	@PikFan	I thought we all agreed that chrome was bad
2015-03-28 16:38:03	Yoshi2_	I definitely agree that chrome is bad
2015-03-28 16:38:07	@Espyo	don't know when that happened
2015-03-28 16:38:09	Ford4385	I still use chrome
2015-03-28 16:38:13	@Espyo	I use Firefox and all, but I've got nothing against chrome
2015-03-28 16:38:14	Yoshi2_	bad if you use a lot of tabs
2015-03-28 16:38:16	@Espyo	...well, I do NOW
2015-03-28 16:38:27	@PikFan	heh
2015-03-28 16:38:33	@PikFan	gah, mistapped
2015-03-28 16:39:21	Yoshi2_	chrome keeps all tabs loaded on start up, and the size of the tabs is decreased with each new tab you open
2015-03-28 16:39:40	Yoshi2_	that is very bad for somebody like myself who likes to open a lot of tabs
2015-03-28 16:39:52	Ford4385	I usually have a bunch of tabs open
2015-03-28 16:40:02	Ford4385	but it doesnt really affect me
2015-03-28 16:41:15	Yoshi2_	this is with only 16 tabs open: http://i.imgur.com/EKuUfF3.png
2015-03-28 16:41:35	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2015-03-28 16:41:44	@Espyo	this is perfectly ridiculous
2015-03-28 16:41:54	@Espyo	I had to specifically say that *EVERY* cell had to be 250px width
2015-03-28 16:42:00	@Espyo	it makes no sense
2015-03-28 16:42:11	@Espyo	normally, you'd only specify you want one of the cells in a column to be 250px
2015-03-28 16:42:18	Yoshi2	right now I have 126 tabs open
2015-03-28 16:42:20	@Espyo	because the others in the same column cannot be different, they are the same
2015-03-28 16:42:27	@Espyo	but chrome for some reason doesn't get that
2015-03-28 16:42:31	@Espyo	Yoshi2: you're going to blow up
2015-03-28 16:42:41	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'll be fine :>
2015-03-28 16:42:47	Ford4385	Why would you open 126 tabs?
2015-03-28 16:42:47	@PikFan	that's a lot of tabs
2015-03-28 16:43:04	@PikFan	how do you even manage all of them
2015-03-28 16:43:06	Yoshi2	I'm only at 450 MB of ram used
2015-03-28 16:43:12	@Espyo	...wow
2015-03-28 16:43:19	@Espyo	with 4 tabs, I can reach 300MB with Firefox
2015-03-28 16:43:21	Yoshi2	because firefox does not load all of them
2015-03-28 16:43:25	@Espyo	it's a memory hog, but not much of a bother for me
2015-03-28 16:43:26	@PikFan	...
2015-03-28 16:43:47	Ford4385	I still like chrome
2015-03-28 16:44:21	@PikFan	what's so important that you need 126 tabs open
2015-03-28 16:44:36	Yoshi2	I really think that firefox is one of the most memory efficient browsers if you use a lot of tabs
2015-03-28 16:44:59	Yoshi2	yesterday I had 200 tabs open, I closed a bunch that I was never going to read
2015-03-28 16:45:10	Ford4385	Holy jesus
2015-03-28 16:45:30	@PikFan	......
2015-03-28 16:45:56	@PikFan	okay
2015-03-28 16:45:59	Yoshi2	well, tabs double for me as bookmarks
2015-03-28 16:45:59	Ford4385	When I use chrome I pin tabs, so they open on load up
2015-03-28 16:46:23	Yoshi2	anything I have loaded as a tab is something I want to look at later
2015-03-28 16:46:48	Ford4385	Use ctrl+D
2015-03-28 16:46:51	Ford4385	Its bookmark
2015-03-28 16:47:09	Yoshi2	the actual bookmark feature is a death sentence
2015-03-28 16:47:16	Yoshi2	I am never going to look at the bookmarks
2015-03-28 16:47:53	Ford4385	Why not? If its bookmarked you should know its important, or a page you want to visit again
2015-03-28 16:48:30	Yoshi2	no, no I don't
2015-03-28 16:48:36	Yoshi2	because that is not what I'm used to
2015-03-28 16:48:53	@Espyo	you should
2015-03-28 16:48:56	@Espyo	it's easier to navigate
2015-03-28 16:49:31	Yoshi2	it helps that firefox will bring me to a loaded tab in some cases when I type something in the url tab
2015-03-28 16:49:47	Yoshi2	but for the most part, I know which tabs contain what
2015-03-28 16:49:56	Yoshi2	lots of tabs with similar content are next to each other
2015-03-28 16:52:18	Ford4385	brb
2015-03-28 16:53:25	Yoshi2	now I'm down to 92 tabs
2015-03-28 16:54:24	Ford4385	Jesus
2015-03-28 16:55:08	Yoshi2	it's really not difficult to navigate
2015-03-28 16:55:24	Ford4385	Which browser are you using again? Chrome?
2015-03-28 16:56:19	Yoshi2	check what I wrote 5 minutes earlier
2015-03-28 16:56:36	Yoshi2	dwn to 75 tabs
2015-03-28 16:57:28	Yoshi2	59
2015-03-28 17:00:01	Yoshi2	often I do have tabs open that I don't really need, but there is a minimum number of tabs that I'm very likely to hit
2015-03-28 17:00:17	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-28 17:01:45	Yoshi2	especially when I research an interesting topic, e.g. how to deal with QR codes in python
2015-03-28 17:01:55	Yoshi2	that's easily 10 tabs I will open at once
2015-03-28 17:02:24	Ford4385	Ok
2015-03-28 17:04:32	Ford4385	brb
2015-03-28 17:04:46	@Espyo	well, at least if you want to use so many tabs
2015-03-28 17:04:49	@Espyo	use the uh...
2015-03-28 17:04:52	@Espyo	can't remember its name
2015-03-28 17:04:54	@Espyo	but press ctrl+shift+e
2015-03-28 17:06:02	Yoshi2	yeah
2015-03-28 17:06:06	Yoshi2	there is a way to group tabs
2015-03-28 17:06:57	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-28 17:10:49	@J	did you still want me?
2015-03-28 17:11:29	@J	a guy at work does that with Chrome - when the tabs are so small they're unreadable, he makes a new window
2015-03-28 17:12:05	@J	personally I prefer vertical tabs, since most websites you have plenty of horizontal room
2015-03-28 17:12:33	@J	and you get 50+ readable tab titles
2015-03-28 17:13:28	@J	I'm kind of OCD when it comes to deleting/closing stuff anyway - tabs, windows, temporary files, emails, etc.
2015-03-28 17:14:05	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@u-78-94-868-36.hsd6.or.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-03-28 17:19:41	@Espyo	right
2015-03-28 17:19:44	@Espyo	I just try keeping few tabs
2015-03-28 17:19:52	@Espyo	and even if I have plenty, I can always use the scrollwheel on the tab list
2015-03-28 17:20:03	@Espyo	anyway, the [[Pikmin drawings]] page was acting up
2015-03-28 17:20:03	Testyo	"Pikmin_drawings" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_drawings
2015-03-28 17:20:18	@Espyo	initially, I told the image cells to be 200px in width
2015-03-28 17:20:28	@Espyo	and all cells in the same columns stayed at 200px
2015-03-28 17:20:30	@Espyo	...on Firefox
2015-03-28 17:20:40	@Espyo	on Chrome, it disregarded that and gave all cells whatever sizes it saw fit
2015-03-28 17:20:47	@Espyo	the solution was to explicitly give a size to *all* cells
2015-03-28 17:21:21	@Espyo	Chrome's reasoning was "if you tell me this cell has to be this size, but other cells in the same column are bigger, I'll ignore your explicit size and make the column as large as my implicit size"
2015-03-28 17:21:36	@J	fun
2015-03-28 17:21:55	@J	can't you set a column width or something?
2015-03-28 17:21:56	@Espyo	mhm...
2015-03-28 17:22:07	@Espyo	I googled around, and it looks like you can
2015-03-28 17:22:14	@J	might just have to be HTML, not wikitext, though
2015-03-28 17:22:24	@Espyo	by creating a new HTML element in the table, specifically for column control
2015-03-28 17:22:28	@Espyo	yeah, just HTML
2015-03-28 17:22:28	@J	yeah
2015-03-28 17:22:41	@Espyo	meaning that to do this right, it'd be a nightmare for wikis
2015-03-28 17:22:46	@Espyo	so screw that, I just told it specific sizes
2015-03-28 17:22:47	@Espyo	good grief
2015-03-28 17:22:54	@Espyo	it makes some sense, but also not a whole lot
2015-03-28 17:23:50	@J	anyway, I actually managed to programming today
2015-03-28 17:24:04	@J	I'm doing more warnings for the file renamer
2015-03-28 17:24:30	@J	specifically, warnings that can only be produced by looking at the whole set of renames, like duplicate destination files
2015-03-28 17:24:58	@J	it needs to work for huge numbers of files, so I'm using a sqlite database in a temporary file
2015-03-28 17:25:12	@J	but it'll essentially actually be in memory unless you use a lot
2015-03-28 17:26:50	@Espyo	right, right
2015-03-28 17:27:04	@Espyo	can't help but think it's overly complex, though
2015-03-28 17:27:15	@Espyo	specially for you; you're such a fan of json
2015-03-28 17:30:58	@J	it's pretty much working and the file that does all the sql is only 63 lines
2015-03-28 17:31:31	@Espyo	hm, neat, then
2015-03-28 17:31:41	@J	sqlite is actually built in to Python 3, so no external dependencies
2015-03-28 17:32:01	@J	so it's actually less work than implementing a much worse page-to-disk for some other format myself
2015-03-28 17:33:15	Yoshi2	python 2.7 has sqlite too
2015-03-28 17:33:23	Yoshi2	and I think it supports opening a database in memory
2015-03-28 17:35:23	@J	yeah, I used it some time ago, but I thought it was an external dependency
2015-03-28 17:35:24	@J	guess not
2015-03-28 17:35:28	@J	http://i.imgur.com/N34Cz60.png
2015-03-28 17:36:33	@J	apparently since 2.5, which is _old_ now
2015-03-28 17:36:40	@J	that's when they added 'with', IIRC

2015-03-28 19:28:16	@PikFan	guys
2015-03-28 19:28:22	@PikFan	they delayed Zelda Wii U
2015-03-28 19:28:26	@PikFan	now I'm pissed
2015-03-28 19:28:43	@PikFan	but if it's to make it even better, then I'm all for it
2015-03-28 19:29:14	@PikFan	so I'm at a friends house
2015-03-28 19:29:34	@PikFan	and they're being random
2015-03-28 19:29:39	@PikFan	but isn't everybody
2015-03-28 19:30:30	@PikFan	oh wow http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_drawings&curid=11626&diff=147744&oldid=147743
2015-03-28 19:30:34	@PikFan	so
2015-03-28 19:30:35	@PikFan	much
2015-03-28 19:30:36	@PikFan	CSS
2015-03-28 19:30:42	@PikFan	awful
2015-03-28 19:31:05	Yoshi2	PikFan: honestly,
2015-03-28 19:31:20	Yoshi2	did you really expect that they wouldn't delay Zelda once more?
2015-03-28 19:31:31	@PikFan	oh but of course
2015-03-28 19:31:46	@PikFan	but there was still a tiny glimmer of hope they wouldn't
2015-03-28 19:32:12	@PikFan	...I can't understand why devs just can't be honest
2015-03-28 19:32:20	@PikFan	so irritating
2015-03-28 19:32:45	@PikFan	however, Aonuma DID say that a 2015 release is not their #1 priority
2015-03-28 19:33:29	@PikFan	though it's likely it'll come out in 2016 it might come out this year
2015-03-28 19:34:20	@Espyo	<PikFan> but if it's to make it even better, then I'm all for it
2015-03-28 19:34:21	@Espyo	this
2015-03-28 19:34:23	Yoshi2	well, Nintendo learned not to give any specific dates for the releases
2015-03-28 19:34:38	@Espyo	<PikFan> ...I can't understand why devs just can't be honest
2015-03-28 19:34:42	@Espyo	what's more likely to raise hype?
2015-03-28 19:34:49	@Espyo	"We'll release the next Zelda in 2014"
2015-03-28 19:34:52	@PikFan	how about
2015-03-28 19:34:56	@Espyo	or "We'll release the next Zelda in 2016"?
2015-03-28 19:35:03	@PikFan	they say they'll release it in 2017
2015-03-28 19:35:10	@PikFan	then say it'll come out earlier
2015-03-28 19:35:16	@Espyo	that'd be nice
2015-03-28 19:35:19	@Espyo	if the fanbase deserved it
2015-03-28 19:35:20	@Espyo	they don't
2015-03-28 19:35:26	@PikFan	true
2015-03-28 19:35:30	@Espyo	anything that's specifically told to be more than 2 years away makes the fanbase fall asleep
2015-03-28 19:35:44	@PikFan	*cough*Pikmin 3*cough*
2015-03-28 19:35:49	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2015-03-28 19:36:08	@PikFan	...if they make a Pikmin 4 I wonder what it'll be about
2015-03-28 19:36:49	@Espyo	it might be very different
2015-03-28 19:36:56	@Espyo	on one hand, they don't want to make new Pikmin
2015-03-28 19:37:02	@Espyo	otherwise people will cry
2015-03-28 19:37:15	Yoshi2	you will be discovering the cause of the spaceship crash from the 3rd game
2015-03-28 19:37:19	@PikFan	did people not like Rocks and Wingeds?
2015-03-28 19:37:24	@Espyo	they either bring back older Pikmin two, and people will cry because memorizing the skills and types of 7+ types will be hard
2015-03-28 19:37:42	@Espyo	or they don't bring back some of the old ones, and people will cry because there's discontinuity
2015-03-28 19:37:46	@Espyo	or they just don't add new types
2015-03-28 19:37:51	@Espyo	and people will cry because there's no novelty
2015-03-28 19:37:58	@Espyo	I'd hate to be in Miyamoto's place right now
2015-03-28 19:38:10	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> you will be discovering the cause of the spaceship crash from the 3rd game
2015-03-28 19:38:15	@Espyo	all aside, likely this, yep
2015-03-28 19:38:34	@PikFan	if you don't...well, what a cliffhanger
2015-03-28 19:38:42	@PikFan	wait has J played P3
2015-03-28 19:38:49	@Espyo	he hasn't
2015-03-28 19:38:52	@PikFan	oh
2015-03-28 19:38:54	@PikFan	sorry J
2015-03-28 19:38:57	@Espyo	not like that's much of a spoiler, tbh
2015-03-28 19:39:04	@Espyo	it's not related to anything in the story
2015-03-28 19:39:05	@PikFan	but it still is
2015-03-28 19:39:13	@PikFan	...OH
2015-03-28 19:39:13	@Espyo	just a little thing at the end disconnected from anything else
2015-03-28 19:39:22	@Espyo	it won't really help the player understand anything in the story
2015-03-28 19:39:27	@PikFan	wait, now I'm confused
2015-03-28 19:39:53	@PikFan	because I thought you were referring to the meteor at the end of the game
2015-03-28 19:39:57	@Espyo	I am
2015-03-28 19:40:16	@PikFan	so you're talking about both crashes, then
2015-03-28 19:40:19	@PikFan	okay
2015-03-28 19:40:38	@Espyo	...both?
2015-03-28 19:40:50	@PikFan	the crash at the beginning?
2015-03-28 19:40:54	@PikFan	when they got separated?
2015-03-28 19:41:11	@Espyo	I thought we were talking about the object falling at the end, all this time
2015-03-28 19:41:16	@Espyo	...
2015-03-28 19:41:17	@PikFan	...
2015-03-28 19:41:17	@Espyo	though
2015-03-28 19:41:19	@Espyo	drat, I can see now
2015-03-28 19:41:27	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> you will be discovering the cause of the spaceship crash from the 3rd game
2015-03-28 19:41:32	@Espyo	yeah, that's a mystery
2015-03-28 19:41:34	@Espyo	no clues there
2015-03-28 19:41:38	@PikFan	maybe both, then
2015-03-28 19:41:41	@Espyo	and then there's an unidentified object falling at the end
2015-03-28 19:41:55	@Espyo	yeah, could be another ship that got detoured from whatever force caused the Koppai crash
2015-03-28 19:42:14	@Espyo	uuuuugggghhhhh
2015-03-28 19:42:20	@PikFan	^
2015-03-28 19:42:20	@Espyo	seeing the short movies is both good and bad for me
2015-03-28 19:42:29	@Espyo	good, because it gives me a LOT of hype for the engine
2015-03-28 19:42:31	@Espyo	and I need motivation
2015-03-28 19:42:32	@PikFan	don't think too hard about it
2015-03-28 19:42:43	@Espyo	...bad because I spend hours upon hours imagining the things I'd love to put in the engine, based on the shorts
2015-03-28 19:42:51	@Espyo	like a seesaw ramp
2015-03-28 19:43:03	@Espyo	in which you need twice the weight to throw up a Pikmin on the other end
2015-03-28 19:43:05	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-28 19:43:09	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaaah
2015-03-28 19:43:15	@PikFan	I wish I had more inspiration
2015-03-28 19:43:16	@Espyo	or idle animation for Pikmin playing around with water
2015-03-28 19:43:28	@Espyo	and the thing is I could do them
2015-03-28 19:43:29	@PikFan	I want to create obstacles for my fangame that aren't just elemental walls
2015-03-28 19:43:33	@Espyo	... at leas the idle animation
2015-03-28 19:43:37	@Espyo	but I HAVE to focus on the basics first
2015-03-28 19:43:45	@Espyo	hmm, I get you
2015-03-28 19:43:54	@PikFan	hmm
2015-03-28 19:43:59	@PikFan	electrodes have potential
2015-03-28 19:44:04	@Espyo	they're elemental, still
2015-03-28 19:44:19	@PikFan	electrodes =/= walls
2015-03-28 19:44:36	@Espyo	well, yeah, but
2015-03-28 19:44:41	@PikFan	electrodes could power machinery
2015-03-28 19:44:48	@PikFan	which could do various things
2015-03-28 19:44:50	@Espyo	oh, PikFan
2015-03-28 19:44:56	@Espyo	would you happen to know what this means? éè¡æ­¢ã ç³ãè¨³ ããã ã¾ãã
2015-03-28 19:45:01	@PikFan	no, sorry
2015-03-28 19:45:07	@Espyo	the first part means road closed
2015-03-28 19:45:08	@Espyo	or the second part
2015-03-28 19:45:15	@Espyo	but the other ones, I can't get anything that makes sense
2015-03-28 19:45:16	@PikFan	I only know ~30 kanji
2015-03-28 19:45:20	@Espyo	drat
2015-03-28 19:45:22	@Espyo	maybe one day
2015-03-28 19:45:35	@PikFan	I could ask my teacher though
2015-03-28 19:45:42	@PikFan	when school starts again
2015-03-28 19:46:46	@PikFan	I can't read most of the first part, but the second part says nisai masen
2015-03-28 19:46:58	@PikFan	...nisa imasen?
2015-03-28 19:47:15	@Espyo	google translate says that too
2015-03-28 19:47:17	@PikFan	because imasen means an animate object isn't there
2015-03-28 19:47:17	@Espyo	but eh
2015-03-28 19:47:28	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-03-28 19:47:30	@PikFan	so is "nisa" a person?
2015-03-28 19:47:39	@Espyo	I really wouldn't know
2015-03-28 19:47:46	@PikFan	odd, ni is in katakana
2015-03-28 19:47:53	@PikFan	meh, I'll ask my teacher
2015-03-28 19:47:58	@Espyo	also, you might not want to show him because some of the characters there I couldn't draw
2015-03-28 19:48:06	@PikFan	her
2015-03-28 19:48:15	@Espyo	I drew them on google translate, and just picked-- her-- whatever seemed closest
2015-03-28 19:48:27	@Espyo	oh, that's interesting
2015-03-28 19:48:37	@Espyo	when the Pikmin are jumping on the ramp to bring other Pikmin up
2015-03-28 19:48:40	@PikFan	...could you not copy them?
2015-03-28 19:48:57	@Espyo	at one point, there's two yellows, two reds and two purples
2015-03-28 19:49:10	@PikFan	>jumping on the ramp
2015-03-28 19:49:11	@PikFan	lolwut
2015-03-28 19:49:13	@Espyo	but the purples go in front of the yellows, while off-screen, in order to shoot the would-be purple
2015-03-28 19:49:18	@Espyo	occupational hazards
2015-03-28 19:49:19	@Espyo	the seesaw
2015-03-28 19:49:23	@PikFan	oh
2015-03-28 19:49:28	@Espyo	two Pikmin jump from above, one below gets shot up
2015-03-28 19:49:38	@Espyo	anyway, the Purples swap places with the other 2 pairs, I thought that was nice
2015-03-28 19:49:40	@Espyo	buuuuuut
2015-03-28 19:49:47	@Espyo	I also noticed a continuity error :|
2015-03-28 19:49:54	@PikFan	?
2015-03-28 19:49:58	@Espyo	at one point, a pair of red Pikmin vanishes from the line
2015-03-28 19:50:20	@PikFan	into [[Mistakes in the Pikmin series]] it goes
2015-03-28 19:50:20	Testyo	"Mistakes_in_the_Pikmin_series" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Mistakes_in_the_Pikmin_series
2015-03-28 19:50:25	@Espyo	mhm
2015-03-28 19:50:34	@Espyo	<PikFan> ...could you not copy them?
2015-03-28 19:50:39	@Espyo	not sure if you know what it is I do
2015-03-28 19:50:48	@Espyo	I pause the movie when the characters are on-screen
2015-03-28 19:50:55	@Espyo	then I open http://translate.google.com
2015-03-28 19:50:57	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-03-28 19:51:23	@Espyo	pick Japanese, open an option where I can draw the characters instead of typing them or their romanization
2015-03-28 19:51:32	@Espyo	and I just try my best to draw what I see on the TV
2015-03-28 19:51:36	@PikFan	I know:
2015-03-28 19:51:46	@PikFan	I could get a screenshot, upload it to drive
2015-03-28 19:51:52	@Espyo	but that wouldn't help
2015-03-28 19:52:01	@PikFan	and since drive is on my iPad, I could show my teacher
2015-03-28 19:52:05	@Espyo	oh
2015-03-28 19:52:08	@Espyo	THAT, you can do
2015-03-28 19:52:18	@PikFan	so there'd be no ambiguity
2015-03-28 19:52:23	@Espyo	but be sure you're not annoying her...
2015-03-28 19:52:29	@Espyo	I've got this right: ã¹ããã! é²å¥ç¦æ­¢
2015-03-28 19:52:34	@Espyo	means stop! wrong way
2015-03-28 19:52:39	@Espyo	oh, wait, one thing
2015-03-28 19:52:48	@Espyo	that's two columns of text
2015-03-28 19:52:52	@Espyo	ã¹ããã! is on one
2015-03-28 19:52:56	@Espyo	é²å¥ç¦æ­¢ on the other
2015-03-28 19:53:00	@Espyo	...which column do you read first?
2015-03-28 19:53:04	@Espyo	the left one or the right one?
2015-03-28 19:53:20	@PikFan	if it's columns, right to left
2015-03-28 19:53:45	@Espyo	hm, I think I got some text wrong, then
2015-03-28 19:53:53	@Espyo	wait, no, ã¹ããã! é²å¥ç¦æ­¢ is correct then
2015-03-28 19:53:58	@Espyo	I'll double check the unknown text from before
2015-03-28 19:55:25	@PikFan	alright
2015-03-28 19:57:36	@PikFan	my friends are weird
2015-03-28 19:58:07	@PikFan	they're listening to someone singing

2015-03-28 20:53:25	@J	I want to test my sqlite database for parent directories of a given path
2015-03-28 20:53:43	@J	I'm thinking of storing an escaped 'path/?*' pattern in the database to do this
2015-03-28 20:54:16	@J	then 'select * from tbl where glob_path glob ?' with the child as the argument
2015-03-28 20:54:19	@J	better ideas?
2015-03-28 20:54:45	@J	that's probably clearer with caps
2015-03-28 20:54:59	@J	SELECT * from tbl where `glob_path` GLOB ?
2015-03-28 20:55:09	@J	glob_path being the column containing the escaped pattern
2015-03-28 20:56:07	@J	the only alternative I can think of is just doing one query for each parent, but I expect that would be slower
2015-03-28 21:25:57	@Espyo	my sql is a bit rusty
2015-03-28 21:26:28	@Espyo	I have never heard of "glob" in my life
2015-03-28 21:27:45	@J	it's like LIKE
2015-03-28 21:28:01	@J	but globbier

2015-03-28 21:47:47	@Espyo	hm
2015-03-28 21:47:59	@Espyo	that might work
2015-03-28 21:48:07	@Espyo	I'm having a bit of a hard time imagining it
2015-03-28 21:50:35	@J	your table rows end up looking something like: frm='/a' to='/b' glob_path='/a/?*'
2015-03-28 21:51:07	@J	then given a new path '/a/test', I check if '/a/test' matches any `glob_path`, and I check if '/a/test/?*' matches any `frm`
2015-03-28 21:51:20	@Espyo	that just made me more confused
2015-03-28 21:51:30	@Espyo	I'm not entirely focusing on this, though
2015-03-28 21:51:31	@Espyo	sorry

2015-03-28 22:01:08	@Espyo	all right
2015-03-28 22:09:43	@J	hmm, as I expected, it's really slow with lots of files
