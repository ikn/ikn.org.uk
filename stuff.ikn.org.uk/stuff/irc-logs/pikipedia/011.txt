2014-12-27 14:44:41	Shard1	A game with Link and Mario would be cool
2014-12-27 14:44:52	Yoshi2	hmm, you do have a point
2014-12-27 14:45:12	Yoshi2	I can't think of too many Nintendo cross overs
2014-12-27 14:45:37	Yoshi2	though theoretically you could think of Mario & Donkey Kong as a cross over
2014-12-27 14:45:59	Shard1	I mean, wouldn't it be cool to have a 3D action game with RPG elements and a whole bunch of Nintendo characters who team up to beat all of the villains?
2014-12-27 14:47:38	Yoshi2	it would probably be cool, but that sounds very similar to Brawl's story mode
2014-12-27 14:48:02	Shard1	yeah, I know, but this would be no side-scroller

2014-12-27 14:49:44	Yoshi2	all the effort they would have to put into making the story good, they could put into making completely new characters so that they aren't limited in what characters they can use
2014-12-27 14:49:55	Shard1	true
2014-12-27 14:52:43	Shard1	Wait, is Shulk British?
2014-12-27 14:59:33	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> either characters, or bytes
2014-12-27 14:59:36	@Espyo	it's probably characters
2014-12-27 14:59:56	@Espyo	Shulk's VA is British
2014-12-27 15:00:14	Shard1	that's really what I meant
2014-12-27 15:03:32	Yoshi2	Espyo: I think it makes more sense for the number to be the change in bytes because the history page shows the amount of data for each version in bytes
2014-12-27 15:03:44	@Espyo	oh
2014-12-27 15:03:47	@Espyo	good point
2014-12-27 15:05:33	Shard1	A Pro Smash player got robbed.. What is going on in this world!!??!!??
2014-12-27 15:07:00	Yoshi2	Shard1: sadly, being a professional smash player does not make you immune to being robbed
2014-12-27 15:07:12	Shard1	yeah, but this world is crazy!
2014-12-27 15:07:32	@Espyo	Yoshi2: it's bytes http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Sandbox&action=history
2014-12-27 15:08:46	Yoshi2	yep, that is proof enough
2014-12-27 15:09:28	Yoshi2	making the number represent the amount of characters would be a lot of work because that depends heavily on the encoding
2014-12-27 15:09:34	Shard1	Maybe Pikipedia should make a Smash tournament.
2014-12-27 15:10:59	@Espyo	mhm
2014-12-27 15:11:08	@Espyo	one of these months, we should
2014-12-27 15:11:35	Shard1	Not sure how well I would do'
2014-12-27 15:11:44	Shard1	I can beat level 6 cpus
2014-12-27 15:12:23	Yoshi2	I can beat specific characters on level 8 or 9
2014-12-27 15:12:31	Shard1	same here
2014-12-27 15:12:45	Shard1	But Pikachu is just insanely OP
2014-12-27 15:13:02	Yoshi2	and on specific levels, e.g. all final destination levels
2014-12-27 15:13:35	Yoshi2	some characters that have an automatic counterattack are horrible to fight against on high cpu levels
2014-12-27 15:14:34	Shard1	Link and Too Link's Shield that block projectiles is pretty cool though
2014-12-27 15:15:15	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-12-27 15:16:07	Shard1	Since my friend is a new-comer to smash, beating him online should be easy
2014-12-27 15:18:39	Shard1	I heard that Ganondorf is a pretty bad character
2014-12-27 15:20:51	Shard1	Do any of you have a lot of Pikmin trophies in smash?

2014-12-29 19:40:09	Testyo	yeah, you could run something like, 'remove all the pixels further than x standard deviations from the mean', then compute the standard deviation again
2014-12-29 19:40:33	Yoshi2	that makes a suprising amount of sense
2014-12-29 19:41:41	@Espyo	because most of it are actually J's words

2014-12-29 22:50:56	@Espyo	it pasted on another network, on another channel?
2014-12-29 22:50:59	@Espyo	I...
2014-12-29 22:51:06	@Espyo	I seriously won't try to understand what just happened
2014-12-29 22:51:11	@Espyo	my mind's already blown with the video
2014-12-29 22:54:37	Yoshi2	I am not quite sure what is happening
2014-12-29 22:54:46	@Espyo	that was two phantom hits in a row
2014-12-29 22:54:56	@Espyo	a phantom hit is when the hitboxes just overlap at the edge
2014-12-29 22:55:05	@Espyo	it's... almost impossible to get a phantom hit
2014-12-29 22:55:13	@Espyo	like, the hitboxes are circles
2014-12-29 22:55:18	@Espyo	and they need to just scrape each other
2014-12-29 22:55:31	@Espyo	it happens like once a month, for people who play the game a lot

2014-12-29 22:55:48	@Espyo	and there, it just happened twice in a row with one of the strongest attacks in the game, on a Jigglypuff that was a sitting duck of a target
2014-12-29 22:55:51	@Espyo	it's... incredible
2014-12-29 22:56:09	Yoshi2_	I've never really understood jigglypuff's sleeping move

2014-12-29 22:57:12	Yoshi2_	in the video clips it seems as if the player uses that move and then his punch becomes insanely powerful?
2014-12-29 22:57:31	@Espyo	it has nothing to do with the move in the Pokémon games
2014-12-29 22:57:39	@Espyo	but basically, when you do the move, you fall asleep
2014-12-29 22:58:00	@Espyo	except if you're touching somebody when you do it, it's a huge attack
2014-12-29 22:58:12	@Espyo	high risk, high reward
2014-12-29 22:58:23	Yoshi2_	that's what I thought
2014-12-29 22:58:40	@Espyo	I'm already pretty amazed to see this happen in tournaments as it is

2014-12-29 22:58:59	@Espyo	(as didn't happen in that video)
2014-12-29 22:59:00	Yoshi2_	but in some of the clips it didn't seem that anything happened right after the move was used, only when the player used an attack shortly after that
2014-12-29 22:59:09	@Espyo	yeah, on some, it was a phantom hit
2014-12-29 22:59:14	@Espyo	again, when the hitboxes just scrape each other
2014-12-29 22:59:23	@Espyo	the attack causes half the damage, and no knockback

2014-12-29 23:00:26	Yoshi2_	silly testyo, you cannot import computers to pikipedia

2014-12-29 23:02:36	@Espyo	hmmmm... you can do the opposite though

2014-12-29 23:04:46	Yoshi2_	copy pikipedia's database and run a local instance of some wiki software?

2014-12-29 23:11:31	@PikFan	oh, right, I've been meaning to ask you about something, Espyo
2014-12-29 23:11:37	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-12-29 23:11:42	@PikFan	okay so
2014-12-29 23:12:17	@PikFan	I tried adding a conditional to {{f:PCW}} so that, if you gave it a value, the template wouldn't categorize

2014-12-29 23:15:11	@Espyo	for some reason, that # is VERY easy to forget
2014-12-29 23:15:14	@Espyo	anyway, as for the style...
2014-12-29 23:15:17	@Espyo	we'll have to talk to Porple
2014-12-29 23:15:36	@PikFan	yeah, sometimes shows up as monaco, other times as printable version
2014-12-29 23:15:38	@Espyo	oh, the style is back
2014-12-29 23:15:43	@PikFan	and I don't know why
2014-12-29 23:15:57	@Espyo	after you get Monaco back, do you ever get the printable version?
2014-12-29 23:16:01	@Espyo	until you close your browser, that is
2014-12-29 23:16:08	@PikFan	it's random, but for me, it seems to happen most often on the recent changes
2014-12-29 23:16:29	@PikFan	alright, closed both fanon tabs, now opening RC...
2014-12-29 23:16:44	@PikFan	alright, it's fine
2014-12-29 23:16:52	@PikFan	random page
2014-12-29 23:16:52	@Espyo	hmm
2014-12-29 23:17:01	@Espyo	the way I think this is happening
2014-12-29 23:17:10	@Espyo	is that the connection to fanon is pretty poor
2014-12-29 23:17:17	@Espyo	so when it tries to load, it loads the page but not the style
2014-12-29 23:17:23	@Espyo	(the thing that tells what should go where, in what colors)
2014-12-29 23:17:29	@PikFan	yeah, this happens when I first open it after the browser has opened
2014-12-29 23:17:33	@Espyo	but when you finally get the style to load, it stays in cache
2014-12-29 23:17:42	@Espyo	and it should stay in cache...
2014-12-29 23:17:46	@Espyo	well, either forever, or for a long time
2014-12-29 23:17:56	@Espyo	it shouldn't just "forget" after a the browser's reopened
2014-12-29 23:18:04	@Espyo	if this keeps happening, we'll have to take it to Porple
2014-12-29 23:18:22	@PikFan	this has been happening for a couple weeks
2014-12-29 23:18:36	@PikFan	at this point I ignore it
2014-12-29 23:19:49	@Espyo	...
2014-12-29 23:20:04	@PikFan	?
2014-12-29 23:23:18	@Espyo	it just sucks that it's happening
2014-12-29 23:23:21	@Espyo	makes no sense
2014-12-29 23:23:47	@Espyo	but it's a server problem
2014-12-29 23:23:56	@Espyo	Testyo has constant problems trying to read the recent changes
2014-12-29 23:23:56	Testyo	for templates where the argument only removes game icons, it's called 'noicons'; for some reason
2014-12-29 23:24:26	@Espyo	...I'd guess Porple partitioned the server connection loadout so that Fanon doesn't get much bandwidth
2014-12-29 23:24:31	@Espyo	it is very likely the least used wiki

2014-12-30 20:12:07	@Espyo	how did time just fly like that?
2014-12-30 20:12:16	@Espyo	anyway, I'd wish you luck, but let's face it, you don't need it
2014-12-30 20:12:20	@Espyo	Prime is your thing
2014-12-30 20:12:24	@Espyo	you've transcended beyond luck

2014-12-30 21:42:28	@Espyo	both links 404
2014-12-30 21:42:33	Shard1	What?
2014-12-30 21:42:35	@Espyo	...they take me to homeimprovement.com
2014-12-30 21:42:43	@Espyo	http://www.homeimprovement.com/miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiAQv_5NA is the full URL it takes me to

2014-12-30 21:43:16	Shard1	there
2014-12-30 21:43:16	@Espyo	they're both broken to hell and back
2014-12-30 21:43:29	@Espyo	that looks neat, but the texture on the Plasm Wraith is somehow REALLY wrong
2014-12-30 21:43:39	@Espyo	it looks fine on the actual trophy view mode
2014-12-30 21:43:42	Shard1	That was Smash Bros, not me
2014-12-30 21:43:46	@Espyo	must just act up on the diorama
2014-12-30 21:43:53	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2014-12-30 21:44:18	Shard1	I have almost all of the indigenous like trophies
2014-12-30 21:44:50	@Espyo	I still have a bit to go
2014-12-30 21:45:03	@Espyo	and I really want them, because I want to see how the Portuguese translators messed up the names and descriptions
2014-12-30 21:45:03	Shard1	Otherwise, I beat all-star mode
2014-12-30 21:45:05	@Espyo	which they already did
2014-12-30 21:45:11	Shard1	lol
2014-12-30 21:45:23	@Espyo	the Iridescent Glint Beetle is just called Iridescent Beetle
2014-12-30 21:45:27	@Espyo	they decided to drop the Glint in Smash 3DS
2014-12-30 21:45:33	Shard1	they do that a lot with Polish Translations
2014-12-30 21:45:37	@Espyo	and then the Smash Wii U Iridescent FLINT Beetle trophy came along...
2014-12-30 21:45:42	@Espyo	and they had to come up with a new name
2014-12-30 21:45:46	@Espyo	Iridescent SCARAB
2014-12-30 21:45:48	@Espyo	good grief
2014-12-30 21:46:26	Shard1	Do they have an Alph trophy?
2014-12-30 21:47:35	@Espyo	yep
2014-12-30 21:47:45	@Espyo	they have one for each P3 leader
2014-12-30 21:48:13	Shard1	Do they have an armored mawdad trophy?
2014-12-30 21:49:07	@Espyo	pretty sure they don't have that one, though
2014-12-30 21:49:09	Miles	Well, Alph is playable so they have to have a trophy...
2014-12-30 21:49:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-30 21:49:23	@Espyo	oh yeah, they have one for each Koopaling too, right?
2014-12-30 21:49:26	Miles	Yes
2014-12-30 21:49:28	@Espyo	so... yep, makes the most sense
2014-12-30 21:49:43	Shard1	Oh, well that makes sense.
2014-12-30 21:50:34	Shard1	Still strange that they didn't give him something like rock pikmin
2014-12-30 21:50:49	@Espyo	they couldn't really find a place for it
2014-12-30 21:51:53	Shard1	They also didn't give much music to the Garden of Hope stage. New music
2014-12-30 21:52:33	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-12-30 21:53:08	Miles	That Mission Mode remix is so weird
2014-12-30 21:53:33	Shard1	The Mission Mode Remix? I don't believe I heard that one
2014-12-30 21:53:40	Miles	It's unlockable
2014-12-30 21:54:31	@Espyo	it's weird, but I like it
2014-12-30 21:54:51	Shard1	Can I get a link to the music?
2014-12-30 21:55:18	@Espyo	should be right there on youtube
2014-12-30 21:55:28	@Espyo	just search smash wii u mission mode remix
2014-12-30 21:56:18	Shard1	All they did was basically make it for guitar
2014-12-30 21:56:45	@Espyo	they remixed the tempo and composition a bit
2014-12-30 21:56:49	@Espyo	the notes are still the same,
2014-12-30 21:56:51	@Espyo	*-,
2014-12-30 21:56:59	Shard1	How can I unlock it?
2014-12-30 21:57:23	@Espyo	hm, not sure
2014-12-30 21:57:57	Shard1	what was google invented for, huh?

2014-12-30 21:59:55	@Espyo	they're a bit behind schedule
2014-12-30 22:00:00	@Espyo	...like we were when Pikmin 3 came out
2014-12-30 22:00:09	@Espyo	anyway, it's either in a challenge, or a random unlock
2014-12-30 22:02:26	Shard1	Ok, you have to clear classic in 20 minutes with Olimar
2014-12-30 22:02:54	@Espyo	oh
2014-12-30 22:02:57	@Espyo	easy
2014-12-30 22:03:09	Shard1	But, I already did that
2014-12-30 22:03:56	@Espyo	then you should have it

2014-12-30 22:04:09	Shard1	Hmm, I'll have to check that
2014-12-30 22:04:29	Shard1	Now, how to unlock Forest of hope
2014-12-30 22:06:46	Shard1	wait, it's default
2014-12-30 22:06:51	Shard1	<facepalm>
2014-12-30 22:11:23	Shard1	So, what do you think of Mega Man?
2014-12-30 22:15:35	Shard1	This music has some tough requirments
2014-12-30 22:19:44	@Espyo	I find Mega Man hard to play as
2014-12-30 22:19:47	@Espyo	but so much fun to play as
2014-12-30 22:20:18	Shard1	I love shouting out his moves as I do them "Metal Man's Metal Blade!!"
2014-12-30 22:21:31	Shard1	What about the Mega Man 2 Medley?
2014-12-30 22:21:40	Shard1	I think that it's pretty cool

2014-12-30 23:55:01	UltraMario	hey guys
2014-12-30 23:55:06	@Espyo	 2) if you hold a direction on the D-pad while a 2-Player Battle level is loading, it influences the layout

2014-12-30 23:57:27	@PikFan	he says that the extra mass is made by pair-production
2014-12-30 23:57:46	@PikFan	yes, pair-production does exist, but only near black holes
2014-12-30 23:58:04	@PikFan	and there aren't any black holes inside the Earth

2014-12-31 19:45:47	@Espyo	I mean, I do get one thing

2014-12-31 19:46:04	@Espyo	but honestly? I've been using reddit for a month, on several different types of subreddits
2014-12-31 19:46:12	@Espyo	and not once have I seen people being obnoxious and using "le"
2014-12-31 19:46:53	Yoshi2	my top three posts by karma: 1) I posted an image of what the text in a game actually says
2014-12-31 19:47:19	Yoshi2	2) I translated some text in a gif file
2014-12-31 19:48:00	Yoshi2	3) In a submission about a project I'm involved in, I announce that I am one of the people who work on the project
2014-12-31 19:48:32	@Espyo	nice
2014-12-31 19:48:33	Yoshi2	1) and 2) were barely any effort, and yet I have the most upvotes from them
2014-12-31 19:48:48	@Espyo	I love when that happens
2014-12-31 19:49:33	Yoshi2	I have tons of high effort posts with less than 10 upvotes
2014-12-31 19:50:46	@Espyo	and I hate when THAT happens
2014-12-31 19:51:34	Yoshi2	I've been on reddit for 2 years now, and only 500-600 upvotes 
2014-12-31 19:52:17	Yoshi2	you could post some lame image in one of the default subreddits and get more upvotes from a single submission

2014-12-31 21:51:19	@PikFan	there was a discussion I was reading, and someone said that it's probably caused by ribbon tear or some ribbons getting loose

2015-01-01 12:20:38	@Espyo	oh, I'm guessing they're the firsts
2015-01-01 12:20:50	Yoshi2	one of the first, definitely

2015-01-01 12:23:30	Yoshi2	hey UltraMario 
2015-01-01 12:23:57	UltraMario	do you have smash wii u
2015-01-01 12:25:28	Yoshi2	I do not have Smash on the Wii U
2015-01-01 12:25:31	Yoshi2	(yet)
2015-01-01 12:25:47	@Espyo	hi
2015-01-01 12:27:59	UltraMario	ok
2015-01-01 12:30:19	Yoshi2	I'm ready to throw money at the game once I finally find a GC adapter for a normal price again
2015-01-01 12:31:54	UltraMario	you could always just get one of those mayflash adapters :P
2015-01-01 12:34:17	UltraMario	wtf why is itunes taking so long to sign into the itunes store >_<
2015-01-01 12:36:06	Yoshi2	the mayflash one is only for PC though
2015-01-01 12:36:51	Yoshi2	can't really play Smash 4 Wii U with it, I would imagine
2015-01-01 12:37:05	UltraMario	no it's not
2015-01-01 12:37:09	UltraMario	:|
2015-01-01 12:37:43	UltraMario	gimme a sec yoshi2
2015-01-01 12:37:49	Yoshi2	hm, unless they also made something for Wii U
2015-01-01 12:38:18	UltraMario	yeah they did
2015-01-01 12:38:36	UltraMario	http://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-Nintendo-GameCube-Controller-Adapter-Wii/dp/B00BS520SG
2015-01-01 12:38:57	UltraMario	it functions like a classic controller, so you can also use it with any game
2015-01-01 12:39:01	UltraMario	unlike the official adapter
2015-01-01 12:39:06	Yoshi2	hmmmm
2015-01-01 12:39:43	UltraMario	the only thing that's a little annoying (not sure if this happes to anyone else) is that you have to give it about 30 seconds to properly start up
2015-01-01 12:39:52	UltraMario	cuz like there's this blinking red light on the adapter
2015-01-01 12:40:08	UltraMario	and for some reason the home button is pressed when it's not
2015-01-01 12:40:17	UltraMario	you just gotta leave it alone for a bit and it should work
2015-01-01 12:43:25	Yoshi2	the downside is that I'd have to buy one such thing for every GC controller I want to use
2015-01-01 12:44:14	UltraMario	wait huh
2015-01-01 12:44:24	UltraMario	oh so you want 4 of them for more than one person then
2015-01-01 12:44:53	Yoshi2	I have siblings who would love to play the game too
2015-01-01 12:45:02	UltraMario	oh okay
2015-01-01 12:45:05	Yoshi2	and I have two GC controllers
2015-01-01 12:45:07	UltraMario	well I think it's only like 10 bucks
2015-01-01 12:45:17	UltraMario	so it's 20 for 2
2015-01-01 12:46:25	UltraMario	not bad if i do say so myself
2015-01-01 12:46:55	Yoshi2	hm, I'd have to look around for it a bit
2015-01-01 12:47:05	UltraMario	for what?
2015-01-01 12:47:46	Yoshi2	for the adapter
2015-01-01 12:48:09	UltraMario	oh well it's on amazon :P
2015-01-01 12:48:16	UltraMario	idk if they have it in stores
2015-01-01 12:49:08	Yoshi2	in your link it is 25 bucks
2015-01-01 12:49:41	UltraMario	oh
2015-01-01 12:49:43	UltraMario	huh
2015-01-01 12:49:47	UltraMario	woops :P
2015-01-01 12:50:05	Yoshi2	that makes it rather expensive
2015-01-01 12:50:11	UltraMario	well it has different sellers that sell it for different prices so idk
2015-01-01 12:50:16	Yoshi2	yeah
2015-01-01 12:50:17	UltraMario	you only want 2, right?
2015-01-01 12:51:17	Yoshi2	even if I only wanted 2, that would be 50 USD
2015-01-01 12:51:17	Testyo	50 USD = 36.86 € / £ 31.525 
2015-01-01 12:51:43	UltraMario	well that's 10 bucks more than the adapter would've costed alone normally
2015-01-01 12:51:56	UltraMario	still better than 100+ dollars I suppose
2015-01-01 12:51:57	UltraMario	:P
2015-01-01 12:52:19	Yoshi2	probably, but I think I will wait a bit more
2015-01-01 12:52:38	Yoshi2	university starts soon again, so I can say bye-bye to my free time
2015-01-01 12:52:59	Yoshi2	in addition, shipping from the USA to here could probably add a bit to the price
2015-01-01 12:53:24	UltraMario	oh i didn't know you weren't from US, sorry
2015-01-01 12:53:25	UltraMario	:P
2015-01-01 12:53:33	Yoshi2	unless I find a local store that sells it

2015-01-01 12:56:11	@Espyo	I'm just bewildered at how I could even find an adapter in Portugal
2015-01-01 12:56:21	@Espyo	specially one in a bundle, and one alone
2015-01-01 12:56:27	@Espyo	(one = one product, not one instance)
2015-01-01 12:56:44	Yoshi2	indeed, you were very lucky
2015-01-01 12:57:35	UltraMario	hey Edspyo what's your NNID?
2015-01-01 12:58:38	Yoshi2	there are two months or so until my semester ends and I'm done with the exams, so Nintendo will have plenty of time to bring the adapter back into stock
2015-01-01 12:59:56	@Espyo	I'll get it when I turn the console on
2015-01-01 13:00:00	@Espyo	I should really save it somewhere handy
2015-01-01 13:00:38	UltraMario	Espyo what's your nnid

2015-01-01 17:42:44	@Espyo	welp, there goes that
2015-01-01 17:42:54	@Espyo	I tried to see if I could find the field on the Pikmin 2 saves that controls the current sublevel
2015-01-01 17:43:04	@Espyo	one save on EC1, the other on the 2nd sublevel
2015-01-01 17:43:10	@Espyo	the two files are ALMOST fully different
2015-01-01 17:43:18	@Espyo	and there are a LOT of strings
2015-01-01 17:43:41	@Espyo	wait, why is it even saving data about the frog enemies, if Emergence Cave has none
2015-01-01 17:43:48	@Espyo	oh, might be the location of the enemies in the overworld
2015-01-01 17:44:13	@Espyo	...Valley of Repose has none, either
2015-01-01 17:44:26	@Espyo	oh, uh, save data for defeated enemies that respawn after some days

2015-01-01 20:33:55	@PikFan	yay for Pikmin 2-induced humor
2015-01-01 20:34:31	@PikFan	I wasn't sure if I was allowed to comment, but I went ahead anyway
2015-01-01 20:34:35	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-01 20:34:40	@Espyo	I was going to post on my user page
2015-01-01 20:34:49	@Espyo	but then that would uh... not-allow commenting
2015-01-01 20:34:52	@Espyo	so that's why it's on the talk page
2015-01-01 20:34:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-01-01 20:34:59	@Espyo	so yeah, comments are fine
2015-01-01 20:35:20	@Espyo	anyway, I'm researching the D-Pad 2-Player Battle trick
2015-01-01 20:35:22	@Espyo	this thing's crazy
2015-01-01 20:37:20	@PikFan	heh, why?
2015-01-01 20:37:49	@Espyo	up picks the first layout
2015-01-01 20:37:53	@Espyo	right picks the second, down, the third
2015-01-01 20:37:58	@Espyo	it's pretty useful to get specific layouts
2015-01-01 20:38:05	@Espyo	which is why I think this was a debugging tool
2015-01-01 20:38:06	@Espyo	BUT
2015-01-01 20:38:12	@Espyo	holding left just messes things up
2015-01-01 20:38:15	@Espyo	it...
2015-01-01 20:38:20	@Espyo	I don't even know, I'm still trying to find out
2015-01-01 20:38:26	@Espyo	but it looks like it just creates a random cave
2015-01-01 20:38:34	@Espyo	using cave units either from the normal game, or from some unused files
2015-01-01 20:38:56	@PikFan	maybe it generates the layouts in a pattern?
2015-01-01 20:39:11	@Espyo	doesn't quite look like it
2015-01-01 20:39:34	@Espyo	because these layouts are nowhere to be found, are pretty much purely random, are not symmetrical, and stuff like Onion positioning is insane
2015-01-01 20:39:44	@PikFan	wait, what
2015-01-01 20:40:05	@PikFan	these layouts aren't one of the main layouts...?!
2015-01-01 20:40:24	@Espyo	nope
2015-01-01 20:40:31	@Espyo	the layouts created by holding left are just crazy-land
2015-01-01 20:40:36	@PikFan	o.o
2015-01-01 20:40:43	@PikFan	I HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS
2015-01-01 20:40:43	@Espyo	not THAT crazy, but still pretty non-sensical
2015-01-01 20:40:47	@Espyo	go for it
2015-01-01 20:40:48	@Espyo	easy to do
2015-01-01 20:40:50	@Espyo	works on PAL and NTSC
2015-01-01 20:40:57	@PikFan	hold left, yeah?
2015-01-01 20:40:58	@Espyo	just make sure you have 2 Wii Remotes with Nunchuks
2015-01-01 20:41:08	@Espyo	when you pick the stage, and the little Onions fly into the preview
2015-01-01 20:41:10	@Espyo	hold left then
2015-01-01 20:41:15	@PikFan	...oh, this is on Wii
2015-01-01 20:41:16	@Espyo	you can let go when on the loading screen
2015-01-01 20:41:22	@Espyo	yeah, Wii only, I'm afraid...
2015-01-01 20:41:22	@PikFan	I thought you meant GCN
2015-01-01 20:41:26	@PikFan	damn
2015-01-01 20:41:29	@Espyo	so did I, when Ryen told me
2015-01-01 20:41:31	@Espyo	but I thought you had NPC
2015-01-01 20:41:59	@PikFan	I have both GCN and NPC Pikmin 2
2015-01-01 20:42:19	@Espyo	well there you go
2015-01-01 20:42:24	@PikFan	hmm, I'll try this later, once I find my other Nunchuk
2015-01-01 20:42:33	@PikFan	I have no idea where it is
2015-01-01 20:42:48	@PikFan	but I'll definitely keep this in mind
2015-01-01 20:42:58	@Espyo	I'll add it to the wiki, anyway
2015-01-01 20:43:01	@Espyo	probably TCRF too
2015-01-01 20:43:06	@Espyo	it's not unused, but it IS a debugging tool

2015-01-01 20:44:14	@PikFan	I don't know why my sound keeps dying
2015-01-01 20:44:17	@PikFan	it's so bizzare
2015-01-01 20:45:25	Yoshi2	ah, it only works on the Wii version of the game?
2015-01-01 20:46:01	Yoshi2	I've always assumed that the GCN and Wii version were the same for the most part, but I guess that is not the case
2015-01-01 20:46:26	@Espyo	they're pretty different
2015-01-01 20:46:32	@Espyo	they're only the same in resources, pretty much
2015-01-01 20:46:39	@Espyo	sound, textures, text, areas
2015-01-01 20:46:48	@Espyo	besides some strings, of course
2015-01-01 20:46:54	@Espyo	like press X to dismiss -> press C to dismiss
2015-01-01 20:47:07	@Espyo	but code-wise, a) they'd HAVE to be a bit different, because of the control scheme
2015-01-01 20:47:11	@Espyo	b) a lot of tiny things change
2015-01-01 20:47:19	@Espyo	and then we get stuff like the D-pad trick
2015-01-01 20:47:26	Yoshi2	hmmm
2015-01-01 20:47:39	@Espyo	also, somebody on NPC!'s team messed up something that was right on the GCN
2015-01-01 20:47:55	@Espyo	[[Credits]]

2015-01-01 20:51:10	Yoshi2	oh joy
2015-01-01 20:51:19	Yoshi2	I wonder how they messed that up
2015-01-01 20:51:52	@Espyo	you might think it's the other way around
2015-01-01 20:52:00	@Espyo	GCN had it wrong, and Wii fixed it
2015-01-01 20:52:22	@Espyo	I tried Googling "Andy Beaucraft" and "Andrew Beaucraft"
2015-01-01 20:52:24	@Espyo	exactly 0 results
2015-01-01 20:52:33	@Espyo	for "Becraft", I got obvious results pretty quickly
2015-01-01 20:54:44	Yoshi2	must be pretty heartbreaking to see your own name be misspelled like that
2015-01-01 20:54:58	Yoshi2	and the American version, nonetheless
2015-01-01 20:55:19	Yoshi2	on the other hand, it's only the NPC version
2015-01-01 20:57:07	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-01 20:57:13	@Espyo	I'm not sure if European NPC does it
2015-01-01 20:57:25	@Espyo	apparently 100% of the people playing the game on youtube have the US version

2015-01-01 21:03:22	@Espyo	for Battle Field, it gives me 2 circular rooms and 2 Y-shaped rooms
2015-01-01 21:03:23	@Espyo	every time
2015-01-01 21:04:20	@Espyo	I can't tell if it's using pattern #3, a combination of all patterns, or if it's using the unused vs_1_tsuchi.txt 
2015-01-01 21:07:43	Yoshi2	vs_1_tsuchi is unused?
2015-01-01 21:09:32	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-01 21:09:45	@Espyo	as are all similar files
2015-01-01 21:09:52	@Espyo	except the one used on Dim Labyrinth
2015-01-01 21:10:01	@Espyo	that's the only level that actually uses the file instead of a fixed layout
2015-01-01 21:11:36	Yoshi2	all those files starting with vs_ are unused?
2015-01-01 21:12:23	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-01 21:12:25	@Espyo	again, except DL
2015-01-01 21:12:36	@Espyo	all right, there's a folder on Abe/vs
2015-01-01 21:12:46	@Espyo	I mean, the folder is /user/Abe/vs
2015-01-01 21:12:52	@Espyo	it has the files the game actually uses
2015-01-01 21:13:00	@Espyo	these files are unique, they're a list of units, and the places they go in
2015-01-01 21:13:16	@Espyo	challenge mode and story mode caves use a different type of file
2015-01-01 21:13:25	@Espyo	that just lists the possible cave units and some control points or something
2015-01-01 21:13:32	@Espyo	the 2-P Battle stages have those files too
2015-01-01 21:13:46	@Espyo	but it's clear that they use the static layouts from /user/Abe/vs instead
2015-01-01 21:13:54	@Espyo	they're not random like in-game caves, they're always the same from 1 of 3 layouts
2015-01-01 21:14:07	@Espyo	Dim Labyrinth is the exception, because it's meant to be a crazy maze
2015-01-01 21:14:10	@Espyo	so that one really is random
2015-01-01 21:14:16	@Espyo	but anyway, the files go unused
2015-01-01 21:14:23	@Espyo	...unless this left-d-pad thing uses them
2015-01-01 21:14:32	@Espyo	I can prove it MIGHT use them, but I can't prove it doesn't
2015-01-01 21:14:47	Yoshi2	would some kind of visualization of the files help?
2015-01-01 21:14:59	@Espyo	like, the unused file might list "circle room, room with 6 exits, Y-shaped room" as the list of cave units that can be used
2015-01-01 21:15:08	@Espyo	and in-game, the left function uses 2 circle rooms and 1 Y-shaped room
2015-01-01 21:15:12	@Espyo	but no room with 6 exits
2015-01-01 21:15:20	@Espyo	that doesn't necessarily mean it's NOT using the file
2015-01-01 21:15:34	@Espyo	it could use it, and leave out the 6-exit room because it has a limit of 4 rooms at once
2015-01-01 21:15:47	@Espyo	it would help, but research would help the most
2015-01-01 21:15:48	@Espyo	like
2015-01-01 21:15:53	@Espyo	trying several 2-P Battle levels
2015-01-01 21:15:59	@Espyo	and checking what makes sense and what doesn't
2015-01-01 21:16:07	@Espyo	problem is that some have clearly different cave units

2015-01-01 21:21:09	@Espyo	like how the Pikmin 2 save file is deleted after 300 days
2015-01-01 21:21:39	@Espyo	for one thing, some of it is hard to prove

2015-01-01 21:22:30	@Espyo	is people calling Wollywogs "frogs" (unknowingly) a misconception?

2015-01-01 22:17:32	Miles	"* In ''[[Pikmin 2]]'', [[ultra-spicy spray]] does not increase the Pikmin's attack ''speed'', only their ''movement'' speed and attack ''[[Health|power]]''."
2015-01-01 22:17:33	Testyo	"Pikmin_2" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_2
2015-01-01 22:17:35	Miles	...What?
2015-01-01 22:17:42	Miles	Thanks Testyo
2015-01-01 22:17:43	Testyo	I'm a fan of global variables
2015-01-01 22:20:13	Miles	So after looking at the Spicy Spray page
2015-01-01 22:20:22	Miles	It lasts 40 seconds. < No, 30
2015-01-01 22:20:47	Miles	They keep carrying fast if the effect wears off while carrying. < This happens because it makes their carrying speed equivalent to flowers, and in Pikmin 3 it outright flowers them
2015-01-01 22:21:21	Miles	In Pikmin 3, however, both the attack speed and damage are increased. < It's exactly the same as Pikmin 2 and sets their attack to 10 (though, that's higher than Winged's 5)
2015-01-01 22:23:05	@Espyo	yeah, it's not that important
2015-01-01 22:23:11	@Espyo	but the article /needs/ content...
2015-01-01 22:23:17	@Espyo	see, this is why I needed some feedback
2015-01-01 22:23:23	@Espyo	a few of the things in there are pretty stretched
2015-01-01 22:23:57	@Espyo	all right, the spray
2015-01-01 22:24:06	Miles	The "The" thing is less a misconception and more that no one cares >_>
2015-01-01 22:24:10	@Espyo	people thought in Pikmin 2 that the spray increased the frequency at which the Pikmin attacked
2015-01-01 22:24:15	@Espyo	true
2015-01-01 22:24:29	@Espyo	anyway, 30 seconds? I could swear I counted
2015-01-01 22:24:35	@Espyo	or maybe just blindly trusted somebody
2015-01-01 22:24:36	@Espyo	wait, which game
2015-01-01 22:24:38	Miles	3
2015-01-01 22:24:48	@Espyo	oh, because I think it's 40 in Pikmin 2
2015-01-01 22:24:56	@Espyo	I'll re-count
2015-01-01 22:24:58	Miles	It's at the top of the page saying "CHECK IF THIS IS THE SAME IN PIKMIN 3"
2015-01-01 22:25:02	Miles	So I'm saying it's not
2015-01-01 22:25:03	@Espyo	OH
2015-01-01 22:25:46	@Espyo	all right then
2015-01-01 22:27:09	@Espyo	>in ''Pikmin 2'', the Pikmin's attack power is not increased &ndash; they deal just as much damage as before, except they do so faster.

2015-01-02 22:03:16	@Espyo	so every time some extra positive feedback comes, like yours, it fills me up with motivation
2015-01-02 22:03:59	Wraith64	no problem, and I completely understand. I cannot begin to list the veritable buttones of projects I have began and never finished, due to lack of motivation.

2015-01-02 22:06:44	Wraith64	Holding it down produced horrid result.

2015-01-02 22:07:36	@Espyo	anyway, the motivation thing?
2015-01-02 22:07:43	@Espyo	it got me to actually kind of do something about it today
2015-01-02 22:07:50	@Espyo	I won't continue work on it for a few more days
2015-01-02 22:07:58	@Espyo	I have to finish some things on Pikipedia before I can relax
2015-01-02 22:08:02	@Espyo	but today was a slow day at work
2015-01-02 22:08:09	@Espyo	so I took the time to try to re-think the enemy AI
2015-01-02 22:08:17	ryenlee	the game looks awesome^^
2015-01-02 22:08:31	@Espyo	thanks!
2015-01-02 22:08:50	@Espyo	technically, the old AI was using an event-system
2015-01-02 22:09:41	@Espyo	now I'm thinking of making it an event-driven state machine
2015-01-02 22:09:49	@Espyo	...let's see how that turns out
2015-01-02 22:10:01	@Espyo	never imagined the AI to be THAT complicated to implement
2015-01-02 22:10:35	Wraith64	so instead of walking straight towards you, it would update its tracking in ticks, like updates over time? (complete guess here)
2015-01-02 22:11:00	Yoshi2	well, there must be a reason why most games don't have a very intelligent AI
2015-01-02 22:11:01	@Espyo	that part wouldn't change much
2015-01-02 22:11:09	@Espyo	in fact, most things wouldn't change...
2015-01-02 22:11:13	@Espyo	ideally, the current system would work fine
2015-01-02 22:11:16	@Espyo	except... it just doesn't
2015-01-02 22:11:18	@Espyo	and I can't figure out why
2015-01-02 22:11:23	@Espyo	so the best idea is probably to re-write it
2015-01-02 22:11:29	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> well, there must be a reason why most games don't have a very intelligent AI
2015-01-02 22:11:34	@Espyo	mhm, that, and processing cost
2015-01-02 22:12:19	Wraith64	happy to report that my pc can handle the demo many many times over

2015-01-02 22:12:57	Wraith64	*will have to make a video showing just how many instances i can run without framelag
2015-01-02 22:13:58	Wraith64	Also, Espyo, I hope you accept the text at the end of my video, I intended for it to inform viewers about the project.
2015-01-02 22:14:06	@Espyo	I do, yeah
2015-01-02 22:14:08	@Espyo	oh, that reminds me
2015-01-02 22:14:14	@Espyo	Wraith64: try pressing F1 during the game
2015-01-02 22:14:18	@Espyo	to see if a framerate counter pops up
2015-01-02 22:14:25	@Espyo	although... I probably don't even need to check the framerate
2015-01-02 22:14:35	@Espyo	if you were able to record footage, and it ended that smoothly, then yes, it runs REALLY well
2015-01-02 22:14:41	@Espyo	I've been stressing out a lot over performance
2015-01-02 22:14:58	@Espyo	but I can't tell if the game runs smooth regardless, or if it's because I stressed out and went insane with optimizations
2015-01-02 22:15:08	Yoshi2	the footage being smooth is definitely a good sign
2015-01-02 22:15:13	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-02 22:15:35	Wraith64	I have a high-end gaming pc, however. A buddy of mine built it a couple years ago. 
2015-01-02 22:15:47	@Espyo	ah, that explains it
2015-01-02 22:15:56	@Espyo	still, mine isn't very high-end, and it can run the engine at ~120FPS
2015-01-02 22:16:45	Wraith64	Its got an NVIDIA GTX 570, which was released a few years ago, so its pretty outdated. But im happy to run the engine! I wish I could open the area editor (although that has nothing to do with the gpu)
2015-01-02 22:17:05	@Espyo	I'll compile the latest code I have and send you the .exe
2015-01-02 22:17:15	@Espyo	now we just wait 8 years for visual studio to load...
2015-01-02 22:17:22	Wraith64	appreciate it. haha
2015-01-02 22:17:24	@Espyo	speaking of things taking years to load...
2015-01-02 22:17:28	Yoshi2	I could try to run it too, I'm currently on a notebook that does not have a dedicated GPU
2015-01-02 22:17:42	@Espyo	J: GIMP, from a cold boot, takes about 6 seconds to open on my work laptop (Ubuntu)
2015-01-02 22:17:57	@Espyo	so it's either my PC that doesn't like GIMP, or the windows version of GIMP is just poorly optimized at boot-time
2015-01-02 22:18:01	Yoshi2	6 seconds sounds actually good
2015-01-02 22:18:06	@Espyo	all right, appreciate it, Yoshi2
2015-01-02 22:18:08	@Espyo	yeah, it is  very good
2015-01-02 22:18:15	@Espyo	considering that on this PC it takes around 30 seconds on a cold boot
2015-01-02 22:18:20	@Espyo	 15 or so warm
2015-01-02 22:18:21	Yoshi2	on my PC GIMP would take tons of time too
2015-01-02 22:18:57	Wraith64	yikes, 13 seconds, looks like I need a better processor.. I've been meaning to upgrade..
2015-01-02 22:19:15	Wraith64	but a warm boot, 3 seconds!
2015-01-02 22:19:18	@Espyo	nice
2015-01-02 22:19:22	Wraith64	I will not complain!
2015-01-02 22:19:38	@Espyo	Wraith, I can't remember if it was you, but were you the one that was reluctant about coming to the IRC because you were afraid people'd swear?
2015-01-02 22:19:43	@Espyo	I know somebody from fanon is like that
2015-01-02 22:20:12	<--	ryenlee (Mibbit@ltr28-bwsm36-2-1-wued744.7-5.cable.virginm.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-01-02 22:20:33	Wraith64	mmm, no, I don't mind that. I don't usually talk that way unless i am in the company of my close friends, but i personally am okay with it. 
2015-01-02 22:20:40	Wraith64	I think pikfan, perhaps?
2015-01-02 22:20:46	Yoshi2	my Windows starts up in less than 10 seconds, that's why I love SSDs
2015-01-02 22:21:05	Wraith64	I haven't been on Pikmin Fanon in a while, though, so I can't remember.
2015-01-02 22:21:15	Wraith64	Also SSD, nice! 
2015-01-02 22:21:45	Yoshi2	I specifically wanted a notebook with an SSD, it was a very long search
2015-01-02 22:21:46	@Espyo	no, PikFan comes around
2015-01-02 22:21:58	@Espyo	we don't usually swear here, but we have no real limits about it
2015-01-02 22:22:07	@Espyo	just the usual rules: don't be annoying, don't harass
2015-01-02 22:22:17	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> my Windows starts up in less than 10 seconds
2015-01-02 22:22:19	Wraith64	hm, perhaps the seemingly young users, like peach bulborb
2015-01-02 22:22:20	@Espyo	reading this makes me sad
2015-01-02 22:22:23	@Espyo	mine takes WAY over 5 minutes
2015-01-02 22:22:28	@Espyo	ah, I think it was PB, yeah
2015-01-02 22:22:45	Yoshi2	5 minutes? That's quite a lot
2015-01-02 22:22:52	@Espyo	to be ready, at least
2015-01-02 22:22:59	@Espyo	the desktop appears after around 2 minutes
2015-01-02 22:23:03	@Espyo	but only after 5 am I ready to use it
2015-01-02 22:23:09	@Espyo	granted, Dropbox takes a minute to sync
2015-01-02 22:23:12	@Espyo	which is ridiculous
2015-01-02 22:23:17	Wraith64	Understandable. I too had a time where certain words made me flinch. But now I realized that its arbitrary. Linguistics is linguistics. 
2015-01-02 22:23:21	Yoshi2	hmmm
2015-01-02 22:23:23	@Espyo	can't it just check if I made any change since yesterday, and if not, skip the synching? eesh
2015-01-02 22:23:37	Yoshi2	I've never timed how long it would take for the desktop to be ready
2015-01-02 22:23:39	@Espyo	yeah, to me, words are just words
2015-01-02 22:23:45	@Espyo	if they carry meaning, that's a different thing
2015-01-02 22:23:53	Yoshi2	but I think I'm already on the desktop after a minute
2015-01-02 22:23:53	@Espyo	but when people swear, they normally don't mean anything
2015-01-02 22:24:01	Wraith64	Yup.
2015-01-02 22:24:49	Wraith64	On an almost related note: I seem to be getting the default mediawiki skin a lot on Pikmin Fanon, does that happen to anyone else on Pikipedia?
2015-01-02 22:25:49	@Espyo	not on Pikipedia
2015-01-02 22:25:54	@Espyo	but it happens to me and PikFan, when we go on fanon
2015-01-02 22:26:00	@Espyo	we have to discuss this with Porple...
2015-01-02 22:27:39	@J	[22:17:57] @Espyo so it's either my PC that doesn't like GIMP, or the windows version of GIMP is just poorly optimized at boot-time
2015-01-02 22:27:42	@J	probably Windows itself
2015-01-02 22:27:45	@J	NTFS is slow
2015-01-02 22:27:56	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-01-02 22:29:56	Wraith64	I'm gonna post the video to reddit, /r/pikmin and possibly /r/nintendo. Hopefully getting the word out will not only generate buzz, but keep you invested.
2015-01-02 22:31:48	@Espyo	all right
2015-01-02 22:34:26	@Espyo	took it 4 minutes to build... how weird
2015-01-02 22:34:59	@Espyo	oh, might've been because Dropbox was being nosy and trying to synch while it was compiling
2015-01-02 22:35:31	@Espyo	Wraith64: here you go https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/crash%20fix.zip
2015-01-02 22:35:34	@Espyo	now, that SHOULD fix it
2015-01-02 22:35:39	@Espyo	if it doesn't, that means it's a new problem
2015-01-02 22:37:05	Wraith64	It worked!
2015-01-02 22:37:31	@Espyo	nice
2015-01-02 22:37:37	@Espyo	the editor should work
2015-01-02 22:37:48	Wraith64	also, you might want to add the batch files to your official build, just as a courtesy to those who test it. perhaps making it easier to access will make more people play it
2015-01-02 22:37:48	@Espyo	but I discovered another crash on it, when I tried to do something
2015-01-02 22:37:52	@Espyo	so it's probably not super safe right now
2015-01-02 22:37:57	@Espyo	yeah, you're absolutely right
2015-01-02 22:38:04	@Espyo	I have to remember to do so
2015-01-02 22:38:40	Wraith64	IF you have a reddit account, and you'd like to generate bug testers, posting the info here is a good help - http://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame
2015-01-02 22:38:43	@Espyo	although if everything goes right, there'll be menus to access these in just a few weeks
2015-01-02 22:38:50	@Espyo	hm, nice
2015-01-02 22:38:51	@Espyo	and yeah, I do
2015-01-02 22:38:58	@Espyo	I'll also post on /r/gamedev one of these days
2015-01-02 22:39:00	@Espyo	but to be honest
2015-01-02 22:39:05	@Espyo	I'd prefer if the project was a bit more mature
2015-01-02 22:39:14	@Espyo	you know some people like to judge alpha things as if they're final
2015-01-02 22:39:27	Wraith64	There are a decent enough people on there to make a few testers, they provide feedback on the bugs. And I understand, its still pretty early.
2015-01-02 22:39:59	Yoshi2	hmm, the game seems to run at no higher than 30 fps
2015-01-02 22:40:06	Wraith64	I can only agree, as I have judged DayZ on its alpha, and given up on it. Starbound im nearing giving that up too, although its in beta 
2015-01-02 22:40:11	Wraith64	Options.txt
2015-01-02 22:40:27	Wraith64	If you put the frame limit higher it can run higher i believe
2015-01-02 22:40:37	@Espyo	Yoshi2: there's an actual cap
2015-01-02 22:40:40	@Espyo	you can disable it--
2015-01-02 22:40:43	@Espyo	yeah, what Wraith said
2015-01-02 22:40:46	Wraith64	it says fps=30
2015-01-02 22:40:46	Yoshi2	I see
2015-01-02 22:43:02	Wraith64	also, i'd like to inquire, is the sun timer always starting at the 1/4 past postition?
2015-01-02 22:43:10	Wraith64	it seems that way to me
2015-01-02 22:43:21	@Espyo	uh...
2015-01-02 22:43:27	@Espyo	I think that's something I started testing months ago
2015-01-02 22:43:33	@Espyo	and forgot to put back to midday
2015-01-02 22:43:38	@Espyo	*to 7 AM
2015-01-02 22:43:38	@Espyo	my bad
2015-01-02 22:44:06	Yoshi2	the game does run fairly well at 60 fps here
2015-01-02 22:44:18	Yoshi2	I guess it does not need a particulary strong GPU
2015-01-02 22:45:16	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-02 22:45:26	@Espyo	one of the biggest jaw-dropping frights I had was with strings
2015-01-02 22:45:33	@Espyo	(text)
2015-01-02 22:45:35	Wraith64	well good, then, it seems that your stress over the performance has resulted in better optimization then you thought
2015-01-02 22:45:47	@Espyo	like, each mob (object) has a list of animations
2015-01-02 22:45:53	@Espyo	and they're named: idle, walk, etc.
2015-01-02 22:46:10	@Espyo	and every single game tick, the game was checking each animation of each mob, to know what to do
2015-01-02 22:46:16	@Espyo	and that's a lot of strings
2015-01-02 22:46:23	@Espyo	if a mob has 10 animations, that's 10 strings per mob
2015-01-02 22:46:32	@Espyo	and there can be way more than 100 mobs (100 Pikmin at least)
2015-01-02 22:46:36	@Espyo	so at least 1000 strings
2015-01-02 22:46:41	Wraith64	that would absolutely tank everything D:
2015-01-02 22:46:43	@Espyo	per tick, at 30FPS, would be 30000 strings
2015-01-02 22:46:50	@Espyo	and to top it all off... C++ HATES strings
2015-01-02 22:47:04	@Espyo	it decreased the framerate to around 20, max
2015-01-02 22:47:13	@Espyo	then I had to make some walk-around code so that it checked numbers instead
2015-01-02 22:47:27	@Espyo	now I'm a lot more relieved about performance
2015-01-02 22:47:37	@Espyo	specially after pretty much everybody who tested it reported 60+FPS no problem
2015-01-02 22:47:43	@Espyo	but I can't always stay relaxed
2015-01-02 22:47:47	@Espyo	the engine will grow and become more comple
2015-01-02 22:47:48	@Espyo	*x
2015-01-02 22:47:54	@Espyo	and in the future, I WILL want to have it optimized...
2015-01-02 22:47:58	@Espyo	and I'll thank myself now
2015-01-02 22:48:35	Yoshi2	it is definitely noticeable that the engine is still in development
2015-01-02 22:49:03	Wraith64	Yes, but with the stage editor, I already am considering this fantastic. I can see the potential. Please, reggie based god, don
2015-01-02 22:49:09	Wraith64	don't banhammer us
2015-01-02 22:49:15	@Espyo	lol
2015-01-02 22:49:20	@Espyo	yeah... I'm really terrified of that...
2015-01-02 22:49:21	Yoshi2	I've had pikmin stand in a single spot and not move, and one of the monsters would stop dead in its tracks and not do anything
2015-01-02 22:49:30	@Espyo	but then... I look back at so many other fan games that are just fine
2015-01-02 22:49:39	@Espyo	and then I look at how DOLPHIN is still alive and progressing
2015-01-02 22:49:43	@Espyo	and I'm like "nope, the engine is safe"
2015-01-02 22:49:52	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yeah... poor AI
2015-01-02 22:51:11	Wraith64	and there are hundreds of other fan projects for nintendo to target, for larger series no less. As long as we keep this thing private, non for profit, the engine will thrive, dolphin's success as a testament.
2015-01-02 22:53:11	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-02 22:53:29	Yoshi2	there is definitely an element of luck (or bad luck) involved in this
2015-01-02 22:53:41	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-02 22:53:46	@Espyo	at least it's not SEGA
2015-01-02 22:53:51	@Espyo	plus, there's still another ace in the sleeve
2015-01-02 22:53:58	@Espyo	if we get shut down, I'll just "accidentally" leak the game
2015-01-02 22:53:59	@Espyo	oooooops
2015-01-02 22:54:16	@Espyo	it's what Streets of Rage Remake
2015-01-02 22:54:16	Wraith64	heh
2015-01-02 22:54:27	@Espyo	uhm, it's what the devs of Streets of Rage Remake did
2015-01-02 22:54:41	@Espyo	I butchered the sentence
2015-01-02 22:54:53	Wraith64	if worst comes to worst, nothing like mailing around CDs
2015-01-02 22:54:56	Wraith64	:P
2015-01-02 22:55:20	@Espyo	hah
2015-01-02 22:55:42	Wraith64	lest nintendo and the US postal service coordinate, now that'd be something. I ordered a thing from nintendo and its sloow.
2015-01-02 22:57:51	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-01-02 22:57:54	@Espyo	Club Nintendo?
2015-01-02 22:58:18	Wraith64	Admittedly i am speaking of the Wii U gamecube controller adapters. also, I am about to go. It has been fun chatting, all. this engine has at least renewed my interest in my wiki, so that's good.
2015-01-02 22:59:12	Wraith64	they kinda screwed the manufacturing and the shipping and everything. I just want to play sm4sh efficiently.
2015-01-02 22:59:42	Wraith64	but it will come! Anyways, i'll talk to you later, espyo. Love the latest build.
2015-01-02 23:00:14	@Espyo	see ya
2015-01-02 23:00:16	@Espyo	thanks
2015-01-02 23:02:43	Yoshi2	see you
2015-01-02 23:16:18	@J	bye /late
2015-01-02 23:17:13	Yoshi2	well, I actually managed to implement permutations successfully
2015-01-02 23:17:22	Yoshi2	https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/835c7f515cebfad7b93d
2015-01-02 23:17:43	@Espyo	I understand nothing of that
2015-01-02 23:17:47	@Espyo	I probably could if I wanted to
2015-01-02 23:18:48	 *	RingtailedFox wishes he could afford wii u gamecube controllers >.>
2015-01-02 23:18:55	RingtailedFox	and a wii u ;p
2015-01-02 23:19:36	Yoshi2	Espyo: give me a week, and I will forget how I was able to write that piece of code
2015-01-02 23:20:58	Yoshi2	RingtailedFox: if you have a GC or a Wii, you could use the money you save by not buying a Wii U to buy GC controllers 
2015-01-02 23:21:11	Yoshi2	though that is probably not what you want to do, is it? :p
2015-01-02 23:29:24	RingtailedFox	well, i'd love to get smash bros. for wii u too :P
2015-01-02 23:30:53	Yoshi2	fair enough, I'm still waiting for the GC adapter to be back in stock, so I don't have SSB Wii U either

2015-01-03 16:40:33	Yoshi2	so everything that is wrong with the language was already known more than 15 years ago?
2015-01-03 16:41:22	@Espyo	apparently
2015-01-03 16:52:05	Yoshi2	I definitely find it silly to create getters/setters for every single variable in a class, and I prefer to avoid doing that unless absolutely necessary
2015-01-03 16:52:13	@Espyo	same here
2015-01-03 16:52:28	@Espyo	there is SOME merit to using a setter, for like when you want to limit the values to which it can be set
2015-01-03 16:52:34	@Espyo	but otherwise, it just makes the code look stupid

2015-01-04 17:50:36	@Espyo	are you joking

2015-01-04 17:51:03	Wraith64_Z	not joking! haha
2015-01-04 17:51:07	@Espyo	...wow
2015-01-04 17:51:35	@Espyo	well, if that's not motivating, I don't know what is
2015-01-04 17:52:51	Wraith64_Z	I seem to know how to push publicity on Pikmin videos, when I was much younger, I made a crappy quality video of my screen playing Pikmin, I got 30,000 odd views
2015-01-04 17:53:36	@Espyo	that's...
2015-01-04 17:53:36	@Espyo	wow
2015-01-04 17:53:40	Wraith64_Z	I showed off a glitch, which is what made it probably so popular
2015-01-04 17:54:16	@Espyo	hmm, probably
2015-01-04 17:54:50	Wraith64_Z	In Pikmin 1 I lied down next to a pearly clamclamp, let the wollywog keep jumping on me, until I phased through the invisible barrier and got up inside the pearly clamclamp!
2015-01-04 17:55:08	@Espyo	I think I've seen that, yeah
2015-01-04 17:55:20	Yoshi2	my video with the most views is a recording of a character with bad voice acting from Skyrim

2015-01-04 17:57:05	Yoshi2	much worse than that
2015-01-04 17:57:18	Wraith64_Z	didn't know it was possible haha

2015-01-04 18:04:00	Wraith64_Z	yes, it works well. The only issues I can't seem to hammer out is that some of the sector points overlap each other, and when they do that its impossible to grab the individual sectors

2015-01-04 18:06:59	@Espyo	if you want to "unstick", you'll have to make two points on the lines of the sector you want to split, and join those
2015-01-04 18:07:01	@Espyo	oh no
2015-01-04 18:07:13	@Espyo	wait, an Armored Mawdad can't be taller than 20cm

2015-01-04 18:07:17	@Espyo	so...
2015-01-04 18:07:25	@Espyo	either that or that's a big Mawdad
2015-01-04 18:07:47	Wraith64_Z	I see, that's good. I wasn't sure if it was okay, because it highlights the sectors as red errors

2015-01-04 18:08:37	@Espyo	though you can probably just grab one of the offending points and move it elsewhere

2015-01-04 18:12:06	@Espyo	the entire episode of development where I had to work on sectors and such was a nightmare
2015-01-04 18:12:08	Wraith64_Z	its just that when I play the area, and I walk in to the black void of nothingness, it freezes the game
2015-01-04 18:12:09	@Espyo	it was complicated, it was glitchy...
2015-01-04 18:12:14	@Espyo	I'm so glad everything just works now
2015-01-04 18:12:19	@Espyo	besides sectors randomly becoming red...
2015-01-04 18:12:27	@Espyo	hey, do this, please
2015-01-04 18:12:31	@Espyo	try going to the void from the top or the left
2015-01-04 18:12:35	@Espyo	to see if it also crashes
2015-01-04 18:12:39	Wraith64_Z	ok
2015-01-04 18:12:43	@Espyo	because apparently it only crashes from the bottom or the right
2015-01-04 18:12:48	@Espyo	and I haven't figured out why yet
2015-01-04 18:13:01	 *	LargeAngryVehemothPhosbat eats Espyo

2015-01-04 18:14:01	Wraith64_Z	I just went northwest, and it crashed still.
2015-01-04 18:14:08	@Espyo	hm, sucks
2015-01-04 18:14:21	@Espyo	well, I think I made it so that anything that touches the void dies
2015-01-04 18:14:27	@Espyo	so that's probably why it's crashing
2015-01-04 18:14:30	@Espyo	I must've done something wrong
2015-01-04 18:14:35	@Espyo	ideally, the maps have a wall around the void
2015-01-04 18:14:38	@Espyo	even if it's invisible

2015-01-04 18:15:23	Wraith64_Z	One thing I noticed about directional input is that when I am walking holding down W and then press A to go northwest, I have to take all of the fingers off A and W before I can press W and D to go northeast.
2015-01-04 18:15:35	@Espyo	yeah, I have to rework
2015-01-04 18:16:08	Wraith64_Z	but its not too bad at all, I've already compensated with just walking differently
2015-01-04 18:16:17	@Espyo	heh, same
2015-01-04 18:16:22	@Espyo	it's more comfortable with a gamepad
2015-01-04 18:16:49	Wraith64_Z	Yeah, also I am adding the walls, I just wanted to see if you knew that the void kills
2015-01-04 18:17:25	Wraith64_Z	So, I could use a GC controller adapter for PC to play the engine?
2015-01-04 18:17:40	@Espyo	you DEFINITELY should
2015-01-04 18:17:46	@Espyo	they already came up with drivers
2015-01-04 18:18:01	@Espyo	so in theory you could just connect it, and configure Options.txt
2015-01-04 18:18:56	@Espyo	I need to document some time later how the controls work on Options.txt
2015-01-04 18:19:53	Wraith64_Z	well, I actually own a PC native GC controller adapter, not the one nintendo makes, and I've used it for dolphin. So on my side I am set, I just wanted to know the control documentation
2015-01-04 18:20:54	@Espyo	oh, nice
2015-01-04 18:21:10	@Espyo	well, in that case, it'll take a bit of trial and error for the axises, but the buttons are straight-forward
2015-01-04 18:21:15	@Espyo	if you know which number maps to what button
2015-01-04 18:21:24	Wraith64_Z	Also, when I was talking about nintendo being not very efficient with THEIR gc controller adapter, it now seems worse because I ordered it a week ago, and its gonna arrive on the 22 of january..
2015-01-04 18:21:36	@Espyo	ouch, that's ridiculous
2015-01-04 18:21:56	Wraith64_Z	Apparently it was shipped from Arizona.
2015-01-04 18:22:01	@Espyo	woah
2015-01-04 18:22:39	@Espyo	anyway, if you've seen Options.txt, you've noticed the controls at the start
2015-01-04 18:22:51	Wraith64_Z	I mean, I bought it through a user on amazon, but at the end of the day I wouldn't need to do that if nintendo had just manufactured the right amount.
2015-01-04 18:22:57	@Espyo	their values are like "k_123"
2015-01-04 18:23:04	@Espyo	except 123 = any number
2015-01-04 18:23:11	Wraith64_Z	Also, yes, I was meaning to decipher it.
2015-01-04 18:23:15	@Espyo	the k is for keyboard, the number is the number of the key
2015-01-04 18:23:23	@Espyo	for joystick buttons, it's jb_
2015-01-04 18:23:39	@Espyo	and then the number of the joystick, which should always be 0, unless you have multiple
2015-01-04 18:23:44	@Espyo	so jb_0_
2015-01-04 18:23:46	Wraith64_Z	right
2015-01-04 18:23:48	@Espyo	and then after that the number of the button
2015-01-04 18:23:50	@Espyo	that's all
2015-01-04 18:24:01	@Espyo	axises are a bit weirder, but I'll explain those after you add the buttons
2015-01-04 18:24:08	@Espyo	I'm not even sure if the buttons will work, but they should
2015-01-04 18:24:15	Wraith64_Z	That sounds interesting to set up, any ways! I like a little bit of grunt work
2015-01-04 18:24:53	@Espyo	hehe
2015-01-04 18:27:37	Wraith64_Z	I own three GCN controllers for smash, and I just noticed my two purple ones have a melted smooth analog stick... too much smash
2015-01-04 18:27:53	@Espyo	hah
2015-01-04 18:34:19	Yoshi2	one of my controllers has a faulty analog stick, the other has a faulty right shoulder button
2015-01-04 18:43:29	Wraith64_Z	So I got all of the buttons to function.
2015-01-04 18:43:44	@Espyo	nice
2015-01-04 18:43:50	@Espyo	any problems?
2015-01-04 18:44:39	Wraith64_Z	But where my computer said B button was '2', I had to set it to that number x - 1. So every number needs to be one below it. Example: button 1 on joystick is actually jb_0_0
2015-01-04 18:45:07	Yoshi2	a classic 0-indexing vs 1-indexing problem
2015-01-04 18:45:22	@Espyo	yeah, that sucks
2015-01-04 18:45:35	@Espyo	I could alter it, but ideally, you change the controls with a menu, not the config file
2015-01-04 18:45:42	@Espyo	anyway, axises are as follows
2015-01-04 18:45:46	Wraith64_Z	so i hope that doesn't happen with the axises.
2015-01-04 18:46:30	@Espyo	ja*_*_*_*
2015-01-04 18:46:33	@Espyo	all right, so
2015-01-04 18:46:37	Wraith64_Z	actually *axes
2015-01-04 18:46:38	@Espyo	the first asterisk is either a p, or an n
2015-01-04 18:46:45	@Espyo	p for positive, and n for negative
2015-01-04 18:47:19	@Espyo	second asterisk is again, the joystick number
2015-01-04 18:47:20	@Espyo	so 0
2015-01-04 18:47:32	@Espyo	third is the axis, and fourth is the... something
2015-01-04 18:47:33	@Espyo	it's confusing
2015-01-04 18:47:59	@Espyo	basically, try jap_0_0_0, then jap_0_0_1, jap_0_0_2, jap_0_1_0, jap_0_1_1, jap_0_1_2, etc.
2015-01-04 18:48:05	@Espyo	and you should eventually learn what axis is what
2015-01-04 18:48:20	@Espyo	the L and R triggers should be considered analog sticks, as far as the game cares
2015-01-04 18:49:22	@J	hmm, weird that you'd need another number
2015-01-04 18:49:29	@Espyo	it's the way Allegro works
2015-01-04 18:49:33	@J	maybe positive/negative to map to and positive/negative to map from
2015-01-04 18:49:38	@J	but you went up to 2
2015-01-04 18:50:25	@Espyo	oh
2015-01-04 18:50:30	@Espyo	I've got it
2015-01-04 18:50:36	@Espyo	it's stick, axis
2015-01-04 18:50:52	@Espyo	Allegro doesn't really take much into consideration if something really IS a stick
2015-01-04 18:51:04	@Espyo	so like, stick 0, axis 0 could be the main analog, left/right
2015-01-04 18:51:09	@Espyo	stick 0, axis 1 could be up/down
2015-01-04 18:51:18	@Espyo	but stick 0, axis 2 could be the secondary analog stick, left/right
2015-01-04 18:51:23	@Espyo	and stick 1, axis 0 be up/down
2015-01-04 18:51:29	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure the axis goes from 0 to 2
2015-01-04 18:51:48	Wraith64_Z	jap_0_0_2 is C-stick down
2015-01-04 18:51:51	@J	I didn't think you got that information from the hardware
2015-01-04 18:51:59	@J	I thought it was just axis which goes from -1 to 1
2015-01-04 18:52:10	@Espyo	it might have to be that low-level, because Allegro has to work with windows, Linux and Mac
2015-01-04 18:52:21	Wraith64_Z	jap_0_0_0 is move right
2015-01-04 18:52:37	@Espyo	https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/ALLEGRO_EVENT
2015-01-04 18:52:42	@J	I'm talking about the way SDL does it, I guess
2015-01-04 18:52:44	@J	which works everywhere
2015-01-04 18:52:49	Wraith64_Z	jap_0_0_1 is move down
2015-01-04 18:52:52	@Espyo	>The stick number, counting from zero. Axes on a joystick are grouped into "sticks".
2015-01-04 18:52:56	@Espyo	>The axis number on the stick, counting from zero.
2015-01-04 18:53:40	Wraith64_Z	so, would move up be jan_0_0_1?
2015-01-04 18:54:05	Wraith64_Z	O_o
2015-01-04 18:54:25	Wraith64_Z	So it is... I guess I understood what you guys were talking about, if not unconsiously.
2015-01-04 18:55:20	@Espyo	hehe
2015-01-04 18:55:24	@Espyo	it's easy after you understand it
2015-01-04 18:55:29	@Espyo	other than that, it's just a blind guess to get the numbers
2015-01-04 19:00:41	Wraith64_Z	so i got the d-pad as point of view hat, and the axis is labeled 2
2015-01-04 19:01:09	Wraith64_Z	axis 0 is control stick, and axis 1 is l and r
2015-01-04 19:02:03	Wraith64_Z	so i'm really not sure what the Cstick could be
2015-01-04 19:02:26	Wraith64_Z	I wanna make the cursor move tied to the c-stick, but i can't figure that one out.
2015-01-04 19:04:55	@Espyo	keep trying
2015-01-04 19:05:04	@Espyo	maybe the final number goes from 0 to 3, not 0 to 2
2015-01-04 19:05:06	@Espyo	it would make more sense
2015-01-04 19:07:19	Wraith64_Z	the cstick is called Z axis and Z rotation in my gamepad config, maybe that helps? I tried using the 3 number but it did nothinh
2015-01-04 19:09:06	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-01-04 19:09:20	@Espyo	I know what I can do
2015-01-04 19:09:35	@Espyo	I can compile a version of the engine that says what the control is
2015-01-04 19:11:00	-->	T3 (T3@21-92-364-722.cable.teksavvy.com) has joined #pikipedia
2015-01-04 19:13:09	Wraith64_Z	yes, that'd be really nice
2015-01-04 19:17:56	@Espyo	almost done
2015-01-04 19:25:01	@Espyo	geez, takes forever to compile, if you add one variable
2015-01-04 19:27:39	Wraith64_Z	I wonder if the program allegro utilizes maximum cpu and memory
2015-01-04 19:27:54	Wraith64_Z	usage, that is
2015-01-04 19:29:17	@Espyo	it uses whatever I tell it to use
2015-01-04 19:29:29	@Espyo	I tell it to only process the logic and drawing 30 times per second
2015-01-04 19:29:32	@Espyo	(or 60, or whatever)
2015-01-04 19:29:46	@Espyo	so when Allegro isn't needing it, something else is
2015-01-04 19:29:47	Wraith64_Z	well, I meant the compilation process
2015-01-04 19:29:49	@Espyo	so it shouldn't be 100%
2015-01-04 19:29:52	@Espyo	oh
2015-01-04 19:29:56	@Espyo	no, visual studio still sucks
2015-01-04 19:30:04	Wraith64_Z	oh i see
2015-01-04 19:30:14	@Espyo	I meant "just sucks"
2015-01-04 19:30:19	Wraith64_Z	hey, at least it does it at all
2015-01-04 19:30:22	@Espyo	all right, that worked, now to test
2015-01-04 19:31:10	@Espyo	...windows wants to install my gamepad
2015-01-04 19:31:17	@Espyo	this is like the 500th time I'm using it
2015-01-04 19:31:38	Wraith64_Z	Uhm, i hate it when memory fails
2015-01-04 19:32:02	Yoshi2	Wraith64_Z: VisualStudio probably wouldn't exist in its 2013rd iteration if it wasn't able to compile stuff
2015-01-04 19:32:51	Wraith64_Z	Well, I was being optimistic, not pragmatic. True, very true.
2015-01-04 19:34:41	@Espyo	somehow it says the joystick number is in the billions
2015-01-04 19:34:42	@Espyo	instead of 0
2015-01-04 19:34:49	Yoshi2	it is crazy how VS Ultimate is more than 8 GB big
2015-01-04 19:35:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: integer overflow? o.o
2015-01-04 19:35:15	@Espyo	...it's a pointer
2015-01-04 19:35:17	@Espyo	I'm an idiot
2015-01-04 19:35:23	Yoshi2	ah
2015-01-04 19:36:23	Wraith64_Z	hmm, but i was able to move it around just fine with the d-pad
2015-01-04 19:36:37	@Espyo	uh, I'll have to work around the joystick number to get it to shw
2015-01-04 19:36:39	@Espyo	*show
2015-01-04 19:36:42	@Espyo	but hey, that's the least important
2015-01-04 19:36:44	@Espyo	so I'll just remove it
2015-01-04 19:37:38	Wraith64_Z	is there a simple way just to snap the crosshair to directly in front of the captain, a la gamecube controls?
2015-01-04 19:37:50	@Espyo	done, compiling
2015-01-04 19:38:12	@Espyo	not quite sure what you mean
2015-01-04 19:38:46	Wraith64_Z	well, in Pikmin 1 & 2, the crosshair snaps to in front of olimar's face at all times, instead of the Wii pointer style
2015-01-04 19:39:16	Wraith64_Z	so you simultaneously walk and move the crosshair in front of you, that could be an alternate control style
2015-01-04 19:40:01	@Espyo	right
2015-01-04 19:40:05	Yoshi2	hmmm, it would be a nice idea
2015-01-04 19:40:14	@Espyo	just make both the cursor and the leader movement bound to the main analog stick
2015-01-04 19:40:14	@Espyo	it works
2015-01-04 19:40:21	Yoshi2	in case you want to play on the keyboard only, or on a gamepad
2015-01-04 19:42:25	@Espyo	there we go https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/axis.zip
2015-01-04 19:45:23	Wraith64_Z	so, what do i do, just put it to axis 3?
2015-01-04 19:46:39	@Espyo	oh, right, sorry
2015-01-04 19:46:46	@Espyo	press F2
2015-01-04 19:46:52	@Espyo	and it'll start logging all axis moves you make
2015-01-04 19:59:07	Wraith64_Z	Allllrighty then
2015-01-04 19:59:18	Wraith64_Z	so its fully functional now.
2015-01-04 19:59:31	Wraith64_Z	I have some notes for a possible control scheme.
2015-01-04 20:01:13	@Espyo	all right
2015-01-04 20:15:12	Wraith64_Z	alright, Espyo
2015-01-04 20:16:16	Wraith64_Z	I have a little bit of information, in a google drive folder, that'll help you out. One video demonstrating the Gamepad controller working, and then a little bit later it shows a glitch i found in my map

2015-01-04 20:16:34	@Espyo	hm, all right
2015-01-04 20:17:20	Wraith64_Z	the zip file has a README in it that details the possible default xinput controls
2015-01-04 20:18:05	Wraith64_Z	and has my options.txt called GCN_LR, it shows the settings i used for the control scheme LR
2015-01-04 20:18:54	@Espyo	uhm, I can't really do anything with them
2015-01-04 20:18:57	@Espyo	I click them, nothing happens
2015-01-04 20:19:25	Wraith64_Z	you can't download them?
2015-01-04 20:19:29	@Espyo	let me try on Chrome

2015-01-04 20:58:18	@Espyo	can you send me the map?
2015-01-04 20:58:23	@Espyo	I won't look at it today, but probably tomorrow
2015-01-04 20:59:57	Wraith64_Z	ok, I'll send it to you in a bit, i just got an amazon package! Raspberry Pi here i come!

2015-01-06 19:35:25	Xtarhaven	hey
2015-01-06 19:35:47	Yoshi2	good day
2015-01-06 19:35:57	Xtarhaven	came by here a little earlier, everyone was idle :y
2015-01-06 19:37:19	Yoshi2	idle is the default state of an IRC user until you ping them by mentioning their name :>
2015-01-06 19:38:38	Xtarhaven	well anyways, I made a thread in the forums, it's not showing up on the forums page but i'll post a link of the thread itself
2015-01-06 19:38:40	Xtarhaven	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Topic:Hello!_Hello!
2015-01-06 19:38:48	@Espyo	hi
2015-01-06 19:39:08	@Espyo	hmm, I'm not quite sure how the fanon forums work
2015-01-06 19:39:11	@Espyo	you might have to do something else
2015-01-06 19:39:15	@Espyo	I'll ask PikFan later
2015-01-06 19:39:19	@Espyo	anyway, welcome to the fandom!
2015-01-06 19:39:20	Xtarhaven	ok
2015-01-06 19:40:26	Xtarhaven	i've been here, but i've been one of those dead accounts, a few Pikmin 3 playthroughs have sparked my intrest again :x
2015-01-06 19:40:46	@Espyo	hehe
2015-01-06 19:40:50	@Espyo	it's fine
2015-01-06 19:42:17	Xtarhaven	I made "Pikmin 4: Curse of Astromountain", nothing special in terms of story but I think I had some good area names
2015-01-06 19:44:02	Yoshi2	hmm, if it involved some kind of curse, that would be an interesting way to connect the events of Pikmin 1-3
2015-01-06 19:44:54	Yoshi2	because in all of those games, the space ship miraculously crashed
2015-01-06 19:45:06	Yoshi2	and yet everybody who was on the ship survived

2015-01-06 19:46:00	Xtarhaven	I don't think it was related to them, I think just the mountain had some magnetic field that disrupted the ship landing
2015-01-06 19:46:22	Xtarhaven	At least I remember that was the story
2015-01-06 19:46:46	UltraIsaac	anyone here have a steam
2015-01-06 19:47:02	Yoshi2	UltraIsaac: a steam what?

2015-01-06 19:51:48	UltraIsaac	alright, sorry :p
2015-01-06 19:51:59	UltraIsaac	I just like changing my name to random video game characters mostly
2015-01-06 19:52:10	@Espyo	it's fine
2015-01-06 19:52:11	UltraIsaac	"There are no users that match your search"
2015-01-06 19:52:13	Yoshi2	I wanted to make a steam pun, but I can't come up with anything now
2015-01-06 19:52:19	Xtarhaven	Isaac as in the Binding of isaac?
2015-01-06 19:52:21	@Espyo	hm... I'll just link to the page, I guess
2015-01-06 19:52:25	UltraIsaac	yeah
2015-01-06 19:52:32	@Espyo	ah, I thought of Binding of Isaac too
2015-01-06 19:52:35	UltraIsaac	I'm playing that which is why my name is not UltraMario right now
2015-01-06 19:52:36	UltraIsaac	:P
2015-01-06 19:52:40	UltraIsaac	also it's Rebirth

2015-01-06 19:55:10	@Espyo	Starhaven: yeah, that sometimes happens
2015-01-06 19:55:13	@Espyo	probably a connection problem
2015-01-06 19:55:17	@Espyo	the IRC doesn't realize that you quit
2015-01-06 19:55:17	Starhaven	hm
2015-01-06 19:55:24	@Espyo	so technically, you're still there as far as it cares
2015-01-06 19:55:26	@Espyo	give it a few minutes
2015-01-06 19:55:30	Starhaven	k

2015-01-06 19:56:55	@Espyo	yeah, I do
2015-01-06 19:57:04	@Espyo	though that pic is Ness because he's my main in the Smash games
2015-01-06 19:57:08	UltraIsaac	cool
2015-01-06 19:57:09	@Espyo	but I still love EarthBound
2015-01-06 19:57:15	Starhaven	you got smash? Wii u?
2015-01-06 19:57:15	@Espyo	oh, that reminds me, I've been meaning to check on how Mother 4 is doing
2015-01-06 19:57:18	UltraIsaac	Lucas is better IMO, but I like Ness too
2015-01-06 19:57:18	@Espyo	haven't heard news in ages

2015-01-06 19:57:49	Starhaven	but Mr. Game and Watch and Pit are close
2015-01-06 19:57:53	@Espyo	I didn't use to have a main either
2015-01-06 19:58:07	@Espyo	but I realized that sometimes you just need a character you're very good at, to do some task
2015-01-06 19:58:11	UltraIsaac	me neither starhaven, I actually like playing as everyone and seeing what strategies I can come up with

2015-01-06 19:58:22	UltraIsaac	the only thing is that I favor some characters over others'
2015-01-06 19:58:24	@Espyo	that said, when I play with friends, it's almost always for fun, and I use everybody
2015-01-06 19:58:33	UltraIsaac	but I like how everyone plays, so ^_^

2015-01-06 19:59:06	UltraIsaac	you were a noob weren't you
2015-01-06 19:59:15	Starhaven	more like a casual
2015-01-06 19:59:18	Yoshi2	there are some characters that I dislike very much
2015-01-06 19:59:23	Starhaven	played melee before

2015-01-06 19:59:31	@Espyo	same
2015-01-06 19:59:37	@Espyo	can't work my head around Charizard whatsoever
2015-01-06 19:59:43	UltraIsaac	who espyo and Yoshi2?
2015-01-06 20:00:00	UltraIsaac	I mean the only character I truly hate in terms of playing as is just Pichu
2015-01-06 20:00:05	@Espyo	besides Charizard, I kinda suck with Meta Knight
2015-01-06 20:00:06	Starhaven	yep, but i'm trying to git gud with gaurding and dodgeing
2015-01-06 20:00:09	@Espyo	his hitboxes do not agree with me
2015-01-06 20:00:14	@Espyo	specially since they changed so much from Brawl
2015-01-06 20:00:22	UltraIsaac	everyone else is just fine, some better than others, but I never want to see I hate any character :(
2015-01-06 20:00:26	UltraIsaac	that's just mean
2015-01-06 20:00:34	@Espyo	I don't quite hate them
2015-01-06 20:00:34	UltraIsaac	unless of course it's pichu ;P
2015-01-06 20:00:36	@Espyo	I just can't use them

2015-01-06 20:01:22	Starhaven	Ganon's really powerful in Smash 4, though I didn't play him in the others
2015-01-06 20:01:34	UltraIsaac	i lot of people hate new ganon
2015-01-06 20:01:38	Yoshi2	I dislike some characters that have very weak attacks
2015-01-06 20:01:41	UltraIsaac	in brawl and Smash 4 that is
2015-01-06 20:01:49	Yoshi2	I dislike some characters that have a very strong attack but are very slow
2015-01-06 20:01:55	UltraIsaac	but at least we can all admit he's not as terrible in brawl
2015-01-06 20:01:57	@Espyo	I can't now, because I'm not going to start the console just for it
2015-01-06 20:02:02	@Espyo	but let me have it, and I'll point it down
2015-01-06 20:02:07	UltraIsaac	what? I love characters like that Yoshi2. :(
2015-01-06 20:02:20	Starhaven	There's so many character with Counters ;_;
2015-01-06 20:02:22	Starhaven	I hate it
2015-01-06 20:02:23	Yoshi2	I can't really play well them
2015-01-06 20:02:44	UltraIsaac	the only characters I don't particularly like in that category are ganon and charizard
2015-01-06 20:02:46	Yoshi2	Starhaven: characters with counters are a pain to fight against when fighting the cpu 
2015-01-06 20:02:57	Starhaven	All the anime characters too
2015-01-06 20:03:04	UltraIsaac	but I love playing as Bowser, DK, Ike, and Dedede
2015-01-06 20:03:04	Starhaven	and Mac
2015-01-06 20:03:05	UltraIsaac	^_^
2015-01-06 20:03:28	Starhaven	The NPC challengers are really intelligent

2015-01-06 20:04:15	Yoshi2	they have yet to make an anime out of FE 
2015-01-06 20:04:17	Starhaven	might as well be
2015-01-06 20:04:19	UltraIsaac	it came after the game
2015-01-06 20:04:22	Yoshi2	UltraIsaac: it did?
2015-01-06 20:04:22	UltraIsaac	Yoshi2 there was one

2015-01-06 20:05:20	Starhaven	no, just every Fire Emblem character has counters, I hate counters is all
2015-01-06 20:05:37	UltraIsaac	Nosferatu isn't a counter
2015-01-06 20:05:39	UltraIsaac	:p

2015-01-06 20:08:16	UltraIsaac	was this anime made by valve? :p
2015-01-06 20:08:21	Starhaven	Trivia: Nosferatu is the first down special move to belong to a Fire Emblem representative that is not Counter.
2015-01-06 20:08:28	Starhaven	yus
2015-01-06 20:08:38	UltraIsaac	okay, so?
2015-01-06 20:08:48	UltraIsaac	a lot of characters in general in smash 4 have a damn counter
2015-01-06 20:08:55	UltraIsaac	that include non FE characters
2015-01-06 20:09:13	Starhaven	I know, but at least the mage doesn't, loves me some magic
2015-01-06 20:09:55	Starhaven	Even the god as a counter

2015-01-06 21:09:48	@Espyo	great idea
2015-01-06 21:10:03	@Espyo	I should probably make Testyo say hi to people, and tell them he's a bot, and that they should wait a while before quitting
2015-01-06 21:10:04	Testyo	so i'm really not sure what the Cstick could probably hack it and do like sys.argv[1][:-3] + ".rarc", right?
2015-01-06 21:11:23	Yoshi2	huh
2015-01-06 21:11:24	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2015-01-06 21:11:25	Testyo	I said so i'm really not sure what the Cstick could probably hack it and do like sys.argv[1][:-3] + ".rarc", right? because Espyo mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages I could probably hack it and do like sys.argv[1][:-3] + ".rarc", right? and so i'm really not sure what the Cstick could be. They were joined by the common word could.

2015-01-06 22:03:50	Spark	psst espyo, youre supposed to put namespaces in header files, right? and then include them in any cpp file that uses the header?
2015-01-06 22:04:10	@Espyo	you can use namespaces if you want, but you don't have to
2015-01-06 22:04:13	@Espyo	but yeah, that's pretty much the idea
2015-01-06 22:04:28	@Espyo	the .h is like namespace my_thing{ int my_var; }
2015-01-06 22:04:39	@Espyo	and the .cpp #includes the .h, and then calls my_var like my_thing::my_var
2015-01-06 22:04:52	Spark	hmm
2015-01-06 22:05:15	Spark	that's strange; i'm getting a multiple definition error for all of the variables in the namespace except for the const ones
2015-01-06 22:05:39	@Espyo	how many files are #including the same .h
2015-01-06 22:05:40	@Espyo	*?
2015-01-06 22:07:11	Spark	three or four
2015-01-06 22:07:35	@Espyo	yep, there's the problem
2015-01-06 22:07:50	@Espyo	#includes are easy to understand
2015-01-06 22:08:15	@Espyo	pretend that in the place of the #include, you copy-paste the contents of the .h and paste it on the line of the #include
2015-01-06 22:08:19	@Espyo	that's what the compiler does
2015-01-06 22:08:38	@Espyo	meaning you said that my_thing has my_var three/four times
2015-01-06 22:09:04	Spark	then how am I supposed to use the namespace in multiple files?
2015-01-06 22:09:10	@Espyo	so what you have to do is tell the compiler to only include the file once
2015-01-06 22:09:13	@Espyo	on the first time it needs it
2015-01-06 22:09:21	@Espyo	the other times, it'll just not include them
2015-01-06 22:09:29	@Espyo	because it already knows about the existence of my_thing::my_var
2015-01-06 22:09:35	@Espyo	now, you either do this the right way, or the wrong way
2015-01-06 22:09:42	@Espyo	the wrong way is to remove all of your #includes until you only have one
2015-01-06 22:09:49	@Espyo	which is painful, error-prone, and wrong
2015-01-06 22:09:54	@Espyo	or you can use an include guard
2015-01-06 22:10:12	@Espyo	it's a way of saying "if you included the contents of this .h before, don't include them again"
2015-01-06 22:10:20	@Espyo	if you google "include guard c++", you'll get examples
2015-01-06 22:10:23	@Espyo	they're super-easy to implement
2015-01-06 22:10:27	@Espyo	so it shouldn't be a headache
2015-01-06 22:10:29	Spark	oh like the #ifndef
2015-01-06 22:10:31	Spark	#define
2015-01-06 22:10:35	@Espyo	that's exactly what it is
2015-01-06 22:10:40	Spark	i already have that
2015-01-06 22:10:45	@Espyo	hm, weird then
2015-01-06 22:10:52	@Espyo	you sure you have it right?
2015-01-06 22:10:57	@Espyo	it shouldn't complain about multiple definitions
2015-01-06 22:11:05	@Espyo	oh, wait, I think...
2015-01-06 22:11:09	@Espyo	I think you might need externs
2015-01-06 22:11:17	@Espyo	I don't mess around with namespaces much
2015-01-06 22:11:26	@Espyo	I just like plastering everything out on the open
2015-01-06 22:11:31	@Espyo	but I'm guessing that you'll need something like:
2015-01-06 22:11:33	@Espyo	.h:
2015-01-06 22:11:44	@Espyo	namespace my_thing{ extern int my_var; }
2015-01-06 22:11:57	@Espyo	a .cpp that has the same name as the .h:
2015-01-06 22:12:04	@Espyo	namespace my_thing{ int my_var; }
2015-01-06 22:12:11	@Espyo	a .cpp that actually uses my_var:
2015-01-06 22:12:28	@Espyo	#include the .h (...) my_thing::my_var = 40
2015-01-06 22:12:35	Spark	ohhh that makes sense
2015-01-06 22:12:36	@Espyo	that's what I do when I have variables on a .h
2015-01-06 22:12:41	@Espyo	I have to mark them as extern
2015-01-06 22:12:48	@Espyo	I honestly wish I could understand this a slightly bit more
2015-01-06 22:12:52	@Espyo	as well as give you the right terms and such
2015-01-06 22:12:55	@Espyo	but I honestly stopped caring
2015-01-06 22:12:57	@Espyo	too many headaches
2015-01-06 22:13:02	Spark	ha, understandable
2015-01-06 22:13:06	@Espyo	all I know is that when I do it right, it works, and I never have to worry about that again
2015-01-06 22:13:10	@Espyo	but try that, and it should work
2015-01-06 22:13:17	@Espyo	if not, try adding "extern" to before "namespace" as well
2015-01-06 22:13:29	@Espyo	if not... try "namespace in header file" on a google search
2015-01-06 22:14:15	Spark	alright, thanks
2015-01-06 22:14:27	@Espyo	no prob
2015-01-06 22:25:42	Spark	okay, another question - i googled this already and found nothing helpful - what about consts? i assume that works the same way but it's saying undefined reference
2015-01-06 22:26:43	Spark	it is defined in the cpp file, and in the hpp file i have extern const int variablename
2015-01-06 22:27:02	@Espyo	it should work
2015-01-06 22:27:17	@Espyo	then again, I don't use consts much, I use #define instead
2015-01-06 22:27:21	@Espyo	but I recently read you should use consts
2015-01-06 22:27:22	@Espyo	so... whoops
2015-01-06 22:27:25	Spark	lol
2015-01-06 22:27:38	@Espyo	but yeah, they should just work the same as any other variable

2015-01-06 22:43:43	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-06 22:43:47	@Espyo	I don't hate them, mind
2015-01-06 22:43:52	@Espyo	unlike people who hate globals
2015-01-06 22:43:57	@Espyo	I just never got around to really using them a lot
2015-01-06 22:44:06	@Espyo	actually, I do use them for the area and animation editors
2015-01-06 22:44:19	@J	they are the absolute best thing
2015-01-06 22:44:30	@Espyo	better than classes, huh
2015-01-06 22:44:50	@J	lots of more modern languages have them built right in to the import/include system
2015-01-06 22:45:02	@J	import gives you a namespace instead of importing all the names
2015-01-06 22:45:24	@J	classes are completely different
2015-01-06 22:45:46	@J	you only have one of each namespace - they're just for making name collisions less likely
2015-01-06 22:46:08	@J	unless you're saying you use singleton classes as namespaces or something?
2015-01-06 22:46:11	@Espyo	yeah, except C++ doesn't care about your imports
2015-01-06 22:46:14	@J	or static classes
2015-01-06 22:46:14	@Espyo	namespaces or bust, really
2015-01-06 22:46:30	@Espyo	do not even begin to suggest that I use singletons
2015-01-06 22:46:34	@Espyo	I will shank you
2015-01-06 22:46:48	@Espyo	no, but some people pretty much do use singletons for namespaces
2015-01-06 22:46:54	@Espyo	Java programmers, mostly
2015-01-06 22:47:43	@J	but then Java is weird, so maybe that's actually the Java version of namespaces
2015-01-06 22:47:54	@J	it's crazy about making everything a class
2015-01-06 22:48:54	@Espyo	Java methodology is like that
2015-01-06 22:48:58	@Espyo	EVERYTHING is classes
2015-01-06 22:49:04	@Espyo	global variables? put them in a class, just because
2015-01-06 22:49:07	@Espyo	a function? class it goes
2015-01-06 22:49:26	@Espyo	makes no sense to have something in a class because you never instantiate it? just pull the "singleton" card as an excuse
2015-01-06 22:49:51	@Espyo	it goes under the premise that it makes your code more modular
2015-01-06 22:49:57	@Espyo	which really depends
2015-01-06 22:50:23	@Espyo	they also use that a lot because it eases potential extensibility
2015-01-06 22:50:31	@Espyo	except I've got a better code design methodology
2015-01-06 22:50:39	@Espyo	You Ain't Gonna Need It
2015-01-06 22:50:46	@Espyo	and who can forget good old Keep It Simple, Stupid?

2015-01-08 19:33:55	Xtarhaven	back, had to do something
2015-01-08 19:34:38	@Espyo	wb
2015-01-08 19:39:14	Xtarhaven	So I got some Pikmin type ideas, 2 are...not so original, but the 3rd might of not be done by anyone else
2015-01-08 19:40:10	Yoshi2	I've seen a suggestion for rainbow pikmin
2015-01-08 19:41:41	Xtarhaven	well, that's the most obvious, but mine are the Acid and Ice resistant pikmin, green and cyan 
2015-01-08 19:42:20	Yoshi2	rainbow would not make a lot of sense from an evolutionary point of view
2015-01-08 19:42:29	Yoshi2	I'm also not sure what rainbow pikmin would do
2015-01-08 19:42:51	Xtarhaven	be Immune to every element
2015-01-08 19:43:02	Xtarhaven	basically bulbmin
2015-01-08 19:44:17	Xtarhaven	anyway the green one is called the Thorned Pikmin, as they have thorns all over them along with a rose for the flower
2015-01-08 19:45:39	Xtarhaven	But instead of the old green acid, it would just be any corrosive liquid, like stomach acid
2015-01-08 19:46:20	Xtarhaven	Because animals today don't use actual Acid
2015-01-08 19:51:03	Xtarhaven	The cyan one is the Yeti Pikmin, it's resistant to frost and can traverse ice, it can also hold onto enemies longer
2015-01-08 19:53:44	Yoshi2	mhm
2015-01-08 19:53:54	UltraMario	just got the starbomb album guys
2015-01-08 19:53:56	UltraMario	it's awesome
2015-01-08 19:53:56	Yoshi2	those pikmin sound like they require their own new environments
2015-01-08 19:53:58	UltraMario	^_^
2015-01-08 19:56:14	Xtarhaven	The Yeti's covered with the snow area
2015-01-08 20:03:23	Xtarhaven	The last and maybe the most original one is:
2015-01-08 20:03:29	Xtarhaven	The Phantom Pikmin
2015-01-08 20:05:00	Yoshi2	what would that Pikmin do?
2015-01-08 20:05:17	Xtarhaven	They're Immune to all physical damage, but elemental damage kills them instantly and they deal less damage, they also have a glowing mushroom for the flower which light's up dark areas
2015-01-08 20:05:55	Yoshi2	well, that might be kind of cool
2015-01-08 20:06:05	Yoshi2	the concept needs to be tested under real circumstances though
2015-01-08 20:06:08	Xtarhaven	Also they have no eyes
2015-01-08 20:06:23	Xtarhaven	to add to the "phantom" look
2015-01-08 20:06:40	Yoshi2	it might be a bit too spooky considering that Pikmin are usually bright and cute
2015-01-08 20:07:34	Xtarhaven	2spooky

2015-01-08 20:14:55	Starhaven	okay, what about the others?
2015-01-08 20:17:35	Yoshi2	sound like decent ideas, they just need a unique role in the game
2015-01-08 20:17:52	Yoshi2	so that their existence is justified

2015-01-08 20:18:49	Starhaven	hello
2015-01-08 20:19:00	Yoshi2	I'd prefer not to fill up the game with more pikmin if the new pikmin don't differ very much from the old pikmin
2015-01-08 20:19:05	@PikFan	'kay so we got our iPads back
2015-01-08 20:19:06	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2015-01-08 20:19:27	@PikFan	wait what'd I walk into today?
2015-01-08 20:20:09	Starhaven	just some Pikmin ideas from me
2015-01-08 20:20:38	Yoshi2	<Xtarhaven> anyway the green one is called the Thorned Pikmin, as they have thorns all over them along with a rose for the flower
2015-01-08 20:20:38	Yoshi2	<Xtarhaven> But instead of the old green acid, it would just be any corrosive liquid, like stomach acid

2015-01-08 20:20:42	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-01-08 20:21:07	Starhaven	don't forget the Phantom Pikmin
2015-01-08 20:21:09	Yoshi2	<Xtarhaven> The Phantom Pikmin
2015-01-08 20:21:11	Yoshi2	<Xtarhaven> They're Immune to all physical damage, but elemental damage kills them instantly and they deal less damage, they also have a glowing mushroom for the flower which light's up dark areas
2015-01-08 20:21:21	Starhaven	Yoshi thinks they're 2spooky
2015-01-08 20:21:28	Yoshi2	yes
2015-01-08 20:21:36	@PikFan	heh, my game goes a little overboard in terms of number of Pikmin species
2015-01-08 20:21:38	@PikFan	hehe
2015-01-08 20:22:00	Yoshi2	what happened to the KISS principle? D:
2015-01-08 20:22:08	@PikFan	at least I balanced it
2015-01-08 20:22:22	@PikFan	don't know when I'll update it
2015-01-08 20:22:53	Starhaven	hey Pikfan, how do you like the Phantom Pikmin, has anyone done that before?
2015-01-08 20:23:18	@PikFan	probably by Extember 32nd, 20XX
2015-01-08 20:23:47	@PikFan	hmm, it certainly is an interesting concept
2015-01-08 20:25:39	Yoshi2	though the idea of phantoms taking no damage is not new, I don't think anybody has applied it to Pikmin
2015-01-08 20:25:43	@PikFan	can't say I've seen it before
2015-01-08 20:26:04	Yoshi2	but I'm not an expert on what kind of Pikmin people have thought up so far :>
2015-01-08 20:26:19	@PikFan	(sorry for slow responses, being distracted by RL friends)
2015-01-08 20:26:33	@PikFan	oh, right

2015-01-08 22:30:40	Starhaven	understandable
2015-01-08 22:31:08	Starhaven	Just what ever pops into your head, like...
2015-01-08 22:31:56	Starhaven	Spitfire Beetle: it aims at your pikmin, shooting multiple small fireballs
2015-01-08 22:32:56	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-08 22:33:46	Starhaven	I actually have a stub article for that http://www.pikminfanon.com/Spitfire_beetle
2015-01-08 22:37:59	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-01-08 22:38:11	Starhaven	Putrid Aristocrab: Has a smaller claw and shoots bubbles more often, they're poisonous too
2015-01-08 22:46:03	@Espyo	most of the enemy ideas I have are completely new creatures
2015-01-08 22:46:08	@Espyo	instead of alterations to existing ones
2015-01-08 22:46:16	@Espyo	I'm not saying that that's BAD, though
2015-01-08 22:49:06	Starhaven	yeah, there's like 5 different bulborbs
2015-01-08 22:49:51	Starhaven	I was thinking of a fox like enemy, for a nine-tailed fox boss
2015-01-08 22:50:49	@Espyo	crazy
2015-01-08 22:59:25	Starhaven	It's hard to come up with aliens that are in the pikmin game's style
2015-01-08 23:00:25	Starhaven	Like I was just thinking about some insect raindeer that would prance around
2015-01-08 23:03:22	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-08 23:04:11	Starhaven	but how would I design that?

2015-01-09 21:24:36	@Espyo	it'd have to be like 10cm
2015-01-09 21:24:36	Testyo	10 cm = 3.938 in / 0.328 ft / 5.26316 Olimar-heights
2015-01-09 21:25:16	@Espyo	for the first time ever, the Olimar-heights conversion was actually useful
2015-01-09 21:26:16	Xtarhaven	Well it's not gonna be an actual fox
2015-01-09 21:26:37	Xtarhaven	are mammals even alive in the pikmin universe?
2015-01-09 21:27:01	Xtarhaven	wait, there's the rats in pikmin 3
2015-01-09 21:27:26	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-09 21:29:18	Xtarhaven	it'd probably be some weird insect mimicking the shape of a fox
2015-01-09 21:30:43	Xtarhaven	anyway, did you see the vandal last night?
2015-01-09 21:31:38	Xtarhaven	it was the new user
2015-01-09 21:39:28	@Espyo	yep
2015-01-09 21:39:31	@Espyo	banned him right away
2015-01-09 21:39:35	@Espyo	oh, you mean on fanon
2015-01-09 21:39:49	@Espyo	I actually did, because I accidentally opened the fanon recent changes instead of the Pikipedia ones lol
2015-01-09 21:39:52	@Espyo	but I see he's been taken care of

2015-01-10 16:29:58	@Espyo	not that I can remember
2015-01-10 16:30:03	@Espyo	I would if I thought about them
2015-01-10 16:33:03	Xtarhaven	hmm...how about a wollywog that releases poison when it lands, but that's probably been done before
2015-01-10 16:35:48	Xtarhaven	...a Dirigibug that throws boulders instead of bombrocks, but actually aims at the pikmin
2015-01-10 16:36:22	@Espyo	scary
2015-01-10 16:38:18	Xtarhaven	It will be vulnerable longer after it throws it than a Careening Dirigibug, and it will be weighed down while holding the rock
2015-01-10 16:45:02	Xtarhaven	maybe a Lithopod that lives in dark areas, they would shoot rock covered in bioluminescent (mold?) (bacteria?)
2015-01-10 16:45:40	Xtarhaven	really only an visual variant
2015-01-10 16:49:24	Xtarhaven	a passive Scarab Beetle that lives in the water, maybe a aggressive version too
2015-01-10 16:52:58	Xtarhaven	A moth version of the Spectralid that release poison while flying
2015-01-10 16:59:56	Xtarhaven	so?
2015-01-10 17:01:24	Yoshi2	I am unable to imagine how well those enemies would work 
2015-01-10 17:01:37	@Espyo	I thought you said "a flying version of the spectralid" at first lol
2015-01-10 17:02:22	Xtarhaven	how so yoshi?
2015-01-10 17:02:58	Yoshi2	needs some play testing to see if the enemy is a fun enemy
2015-01-10 17:04:48	Xtarhaven	well do you have any ideas smart guy?
2015-01-10 17:15:37	Yoshi2	alternatively, I suppose it should be possible to test enemy concepts on paper
2015-01-10 17:16:30	Xtarhaven	really?
2015-01-10 17:17:40	Yoshi2	no idea, I'm not a game designer :s
2015-01-10 17:18:57	@Espyo	you can judge if something's good in theory
2015-01-10 17:19:01	@Espyo	but that won't mean it's good in practice

2015-01-10 17:19:26	@Espyo	it could make sense, and you'd have to use whites and such
2015-01-10 17:19:42	@Espyo	but if the spectralids always appear in groups, and spontaneously
2015-01-10 17:19:55	@Espyo	the player might not have enough time to react, before they disappear
2015-01-10 17:20:09	@Espyo	by react I mean dismissing and putting the non-whites in a safe place, and then coming back with whites to attack
2015-01-10 17:20:18	@Espyo	instead of being a spectralid, but that needs whites
2015-01-10 17:20:28	@Espyo	it becomes just a spontaneous panic-creator
2015-01-10 17:20:35	@Espyo	that's why the enemies always have to be tested
2015-01-10 17:20:38	@Espyo	but ideas are just ideas, so...
2015-01-10 17:23:03	Yoshi2	game development can be suprisingly dynamic, things are cut from the final game all the time
2015-01-10 17:23:54	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-10 17:25:08	Xtarhaven	I mean the Spectralids in Pikmin 3 usually don't appear in groups, it would just be one big moth
2015-01-10 17:25:39	Xtarhaven	it'll act like those ones
2015-01-10 17:26:01	Xtarhaven	not instantly killed though
2015-01-10 17:26:13	@Espyo	right, but I was thinking of the Pikmin 2 ones
2015-01-10 17:26:17	Xtarhaven	yeah
2015-01-10 17:26:24	@Espyo	it could work
2015-01-10 17:27:15	Xtarhaven	Maybe it could land on a object above you can spread the poison that way instead of when it's flying
2015-01-10 17:27:46	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-10 17:36:36	Xtarhaven	In my "abandoned" fangame I had three extra areas, two of the caves had new enemy ideas, Clay Sanctuary had these clay soldiers that looked like gyroids, and Texgnome Complex had some tribe like enemy
2015-01-10 17:37:50	Xtarhaven	the Texgnomes would have different wood mask and "weapons"
2015-01-10 17:38:17	Xtarhaven	Like the "guard" would have a spiked club
2015-01-10 17:39:12	@Espyo	hmm
2015-01-10 17:39:16	@Espyo	sound really trippy
2015-01-10 17:40:14	Xtarhaven	and the "sniper" would have a poison blowdart, and the "Warrior" would have a make-shift sword
2015-01-10 17:42:55	Xtarhaven	One cave was called the Toxic Train Station, that would have some poisonous centipede boss, like the Pinchipede from Nintendo Land
2015-01-10 17:43:42	Xtarhaven	And there would be a Cave in a massive Eel called the Internal Maze
2015-01-10 17:45:29	Xtarhaven	here i'll post a the names of all of them, if you want
2015-01-10 17:46:23	Xtarhaven	better yet i'll just link it
2015-01-10 17:46:33	Xtarhaven	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_4:_Curse_of_Astromountain
2015-01-10 17:47:54	Xtarhaven	see any that stand out to you?
2015-01-10 17:50:48	@Espyo	sorry, I'm a bit busy working on the engine
2015-01-10 17:50:50	@Espyo	so I can't really check
2015-01-10 17:51:41	Xtarhaven	engine?
2015-01-10 17:52:19	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-10 17:52:24	@Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Topic:Pikmin_Engine_by_Espyo
2015-01-10 17:53:04	Xtarhaven	oh man, how's it going then?
2015-01-10 17:53:21	@Espyo	so far so good
2015-01-10 17:53:26	@Espyo	I'm changing a lot of code now
2015-01-10 17:53:38	@Espyo	you know how enemies can't walk backwards or to the sides, in the games?
2015-01-10 17:53:46	@Espyo	they can in the engine, so I'm changing to match the games
2015-01-10 17:53:49	@Espyo	and I'm changing a lot of things
2015-01-10 17:53:54	@Espyo	chances are this thing's gonna crash
2015-01-10 17:54:15	Xtarhaven	hm
2015-01-10 17:54:56	Xtarhaven	neat
2015-01-10 17:55:58	Xtarhaven	well if you can't check the fangame i'll just tell you the names that I like the most
2015-01-10 17:56:50	@Espyo	all right
2015-01-10 17:57:26	Xtarhaven	Abyssal Stronghold, Spacial Spire, Lightshow Lake, Dusk Labyrinth, Spiteful Shore, Heart of Space, Spectrum Cave, Mirror Tunnels
2015-01-10 17:57:57	Xtarhaven	what about you yoshi, what do you think of them?
2015-01-10 17:59:19	@Espyo	they sound good
2015-01-10 18:00:29	Xtarhaven	thanks
2015-01-10 18:03:00	Xtarhaven	It's sort of hard to come up with names that don't have "of"
2015-01-10 18:03:09	@Espyo	hm, yeah, a bit
2015-01-10 18:05:29	Xtarhaven	oh two others that I love are: Toy Box of Terror and Jigsaw Meadows :3 
2015-01-10 18:05:38	@Espyo	heh
2015-01-10 18:17:44	Yoshi2	the names do sound quite decent
2015-01-10 18:19:02	Yoshi2	names with "of" can quite easily be converted into names that don't have "of"
2015-01-10 18:20:48	Xtarhaven	Terrible Toy Box, Cardial Space
2015-01-10 18:20:52	Xtarhaven	eh eh?
2015-01-10 18:22:02	Yoshi2	I didn't say they would still sound good :P
2015-01-10 18:22:14	Yoshi2	but yeah, you do have a point
2015-01-10 18:23:12	Xtarhaven	yeah, thanks
2015-01-10 18:24:01	Xtarhaven	I'm liking Cardial Space though :y
2015-01-10 18:24:49	Xtarhaven	but that sounds more like an area than a dungeon :L
2015-01-10 18:26:25	@Espyo	ah crap!
2015-01-10 18:26:27	@Espyo	it didn't crash
2015-01-10 18:26:32	@Espyo	but I forgot one important thing:
2015-01-10 18:26:39	Xtarhaven	and that's a bad thing?
2015-01-10 18:26:43	@Espyo	if they're too close to the target point and they go beyond...
2015-01-10 18:26:52	@Espyo	the only way they have to go back is to turn around and try again
2015-01-10 18:26:56	@Espyo	because they can't walk backwards
2015-01-10 18:27:06	@Espyo	and on the engine, Louie is super-fast because it's easier to go to places, for testing
2015-01-10 18:27:09	@Espyo	and I called Louie in...
2015-01-10 18:27:16	@Espyo	well, I'll just record a gif
2015-01-10 18:27:17	@Espyo	this is too good
2015-01-10 18:27:56	Xtarhaven	o, yeah tell me the details of the engine, does it have models?
2015-01-10 18:28:37	Xtarhaven	but I guess the gif will speak for it self, never mind
2015-01-10 18:29:47	@J	like the breadbugs all over again?
2015-01-10 18:30:14	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Louie%20Cyclone.gif
2015-01-10 18:30:16	@Espyo	J: pretty much
2015-01-10 18:30:17	@Espyo	but smaller radius
2015-01-10 18:31:03	Xtarhaven	cool, it's a bird eye view
2015-01-10 18:31:14	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-10 18:31:19	@Espyo	I'm keeping a collection of all of these bloopers
2015-01-10 18:31:39	@Espyo	Xtarhaven: it wouldn't really work well with models, because people are meant to make their own enemies and levels
2015-01-10 18:31:47	@Espyo	and it's too hard to make good-looking 3D things
2015-01-10 18:31:51	Xtarhaven	yeah
2015-01-10 18:32:02	Xtarhaven	Pixel art "could" work
2015-01-10 18:32:34	Xtarhaven	not in 3d of course
2015-01-10 18:33:40	Xtarhaven	but I guess that looks better
2015-01-10 18:35:22	Xtarhaven	that reminds me, i'm trying to get into pixel art, i've made a little wizard character if you'd like to see
2015-01-10 18:35:57	@Espyo	sure thing
2015-01-10 18:36:13	Xtarhaven	just got to upload it to a image
2015-01-10 18:37:07	Xtarhaven	it will be really small though, you might have to zoom in
2015-01-10 18:37:43	@Espyo	okay
2015-01-10 18:38:26	Xtarhaven	http://40.media.tumblr.com/547909719c76aab74b40f79163a4c8db/tumblr_nhz532X2Ln1tkstino1_75sq.png
2015-01-10 18:39:00	Xtarhaven	oh wow that's really small
2015-01-10 18:40:03	Xtarhaven	I call him, Wiz
2015-01-10 18:41:06	@Espyo	it looks neat, but it needs more lighting IMO
2015-01-10 18:42:31	Xtarhaven	thanks, i'll work on that
2015-01-10 18:42:43	Xtarhaven	but for now I'll make the pixels 3x3
2015-01-10 18:49:01	@Espyo	got a crash for no reason, while trying to load a text file
2015-01-10 18:49:05	@Espyo	rebooted the game
2015-01-10 18:49:08	@Espyo	loaded perfectly
2015-01-10 18:49:10	@Espyo	thanks visual studio
2015-01-10 18:50:11	Yoshi2	thanks obama
2015-01-10 18:50:25	Yoshi2	or bill gates, would probably be more accurate
2015-01-10 18:50:59	@Espyo	I'm so confused
2015-01-10 18:51:05	@Espyo	I don't know what I did, but they're still moving in circles
2015-01-10 18:51:14	@Espyo	and for some reason, only like 5 of the 30+ Pikmin I called came to me
2015-01-10 18:51:20	@Espyo	and it looks like a floral dance around Olimar
2015-01-10 18:51:22	@Espyo	featuring the President
2015-01-10 18:51:37	@Espyo	all this while the Mother 3 OST's playing on Winamp, and the current song is Salsa's theme
2015-01-10 18:51:43	@Espyo	this is Nirvana, right here
2015-01-10 18:52:39	Xtarhaven	amazing
2015-01-10 18:53:25	@Espyo	they're still dancing around me, but at least they all came to me this time
2015-01-10 18:53:33	@Espyo	it's actually a pretty beautiful sight
2015-01-10 18:53:35	@Espyo	mesmerizing
2015-01-10 19:00:13	Xtarhaven	finished Wiz's head and hat
2015-01-10 19:07:28	@Espyo	giid
2015-01-10 19:07:29	@Espyo	*good
2015-01-10 19:07:34	@Espyo	I have to stop programming for the day
2015-01-10 19:07:41	@Espyo	visual studio decided it doesn't actually want to compile my changes
2015-01-10 19:07:48	@Espyo	it just spends 1 minute doing nothing; the program acts the same
2015-01-10 19:07:57	@Espyo	but if I force a recompile from scratch, it works then
2015-01-10 19:08:00	@Espyo	smg
2015-01-10 19:08:01	@Espyo	*smh
2015-01-10 19:31:13	Xtarhaven	okay I finished Wiz, but I forgot the wand halfway through, it's fine

2015-01-10 19:32:41	@Espyo	looks nicer now
2015-01-10 19:32:49	Xtarhaven	thanks
2015-01-10 19:33:11	Xtarhaven	added shade to the bottom of the hat and along the left side of the robe
2015-01-10 19:34:02	Xtarhaven	oh and a bit on his head

2015-01-10 20:15:58	Yoshi2	I do want to sleep if that counts
2015-01-10 20:16:05	Yoshi2	but it is a bit too early to go to bed

2015-01-10 20:17:23	Yoshi2	sounds awesome
2015-01-10 20:17:49	Xtarhaven	do you two happen to have Dark Souls 2?
2015-01-10 20:18:24	@Espyo	nope

2015-01-10 20:40:47	@Espyo	Allegro is randomly telling me I have 0 or 1 joysticks
2015-01-10 20:40:50	@Espyo	it didn't use to do this
2015-01-10 20:40:53	@Espyo	and I could easily blame windows
2015-01-10 20:40:57	@Espyo	probably will, too
2015-01-10 20:41:10	@Espyo	anyway, the problem is that half of the time, the group move is all the way to the left
2015-01-10 20:41:14	@Espyo	as if I held the C-stick left
2015-01-10 20:45:47	Yoshi2	Xtarhaven: nope, don't have it
2015-01-10 20:47:13	@Espyo	...oh
2015-01-10 20:47:26	@Espyo	I installed some GameCube adapter drivers from the Smash community
2015-01-10 20:47:33	@Espyo	it didn't work, and installed some garbage
2015-01-10 20:47:38	@Espyo	that's probably what Allegro is reading
2015-01-10 20:47:42	@Espyo	still, doesn't explain why half the time, it's fine

2015-01-10 22:35:23	Waterpikmin	that is interesting
2015-01-10 22:35:37	Waterpikmin	i wonder where other ppl are?
2015-01-10 22:35:53	Xtarhaven	it could either be the color purple, or the sound pitch that the purple pikmin make when they land
2015-01-10 22:36:00	Xtarhaven	idk
2015-01-10 22:36:02	Waterpikmin	probably the sound
2015-01-10 22:36:39	Waterpikmin	sound waves could disturb the anchored form and transfer it to the real world
2015-01-10 22:38:40	Waterpikmin	hmm...

2015-01-10 23:36:57	JPMRocks	xtar, how can we assist ye
2015-01-10 23:37:41	Xtarhaven	I'd just like to join the skype group
2015-01-10 23:37:55	JPMRocks	well
2015-01-10 23:38:10	JPMRocks	how can ye benefit the Pikipedia as a whole?
2015-01-10 23:39:25	Xtarhaven	oh, I thought it just was a separate chatroom, not some...admin hangout
2015-01-10 23:39:57	Xtarhaven	Not many people are "here" so I thought
2015-01-10 23:40:10	Xtarhaven	the group would have more people
2015-01-10 23:42:59	Xtarhaven	but if you want to know what I would do, I was just gonna make a fangame, but not right now so you don't have to do it now
2015-01-10 23:45:53	Xtarhaven	So is the silence a no? I understand
2015-01-10 23:48:28	Yoshi2	Xtarhaven: let's ask Espyo and see what he can tell us
2015-01-10 23:48:41	@Espyo	oh
2015-01-10 23:48:54	@Espyo	like, I'm not familiar on how to get in the group
2015-01-10 23:48:56	@Espyo	even though I'm there
2015-01-10 23:49:04	@Espyo	it's like a remainder of the times where we were on wikia
2015-01-10 23:49:16	@Espyo	JPMRocks, he needs an answer
2015-01-10 23:51:58	Yoshi2	technically, all that is required is that somebody from the group invites you into the group
2015-01-10 23:52:26	Yoshi2	but it's been a while since I last used skype groups, so I don't remember the exact details anymore
2015-01-10 23:52:57	Xtarhaven	I saw in the comments of the first pikcast videa JPM called you "like, a myth" :y
2015-01-10 23:54:53	Xtarhaven	but if it's just the main wiki users, I don't know if i'm "that" intrested
2015-01-10 23:56:41	JPMRocks	what sorry
2015-01-10 23:56:46	JPMRocks	whatching punch out stuff
2015-01-10 23:56:52	JPMRocks	what i miss?
2015-01-10 23:57:09	JPMRocks	well, you can join the skype chat
2015-01-10 23:57:16	JPMRocks	and we can test ye i suppose
2015-01-10 23:57:25	JPMRocks	add "ShadowRaptor101" and he'll add ye
2015-01-10 23:57:56	Xtarhaven	"test"?
2015-01-10 23:59:25	JPMRocks	idk
2015-01-10 23:59:31	JPMRocks	add ShadowRaptor101
2015-01-10 23:59:39	JPMRocks	then he'll add you and we'll pass ye around
2015-01-10 23:59:48	Xtarhaven	alright
2015-01-11 00:00:33	Xtarhaven	hm, the only person who comes up is "Blue Swift" Is that him?
2015-01-11 00:00:45	JPMRocks	yep
2015-01-11 00:02:52	Xtarhaven	ok added him
2015-01-11 00:05:51	Xtarhaven	don't have a mic though so I don't know if that adds in

2015-01-11 12:19:35	Testyo	is that case your ISP does suck
2015-01-11 12:20:03	@J	wow

2015-01-11 12:20:38	Yoshi2	"Farragone is a GUI batch file renamer for those who understand regular expressions, glob-style patterns and maybe a little scripting. "
2015-01-11 12:20:43	Yoshi2	regular expressions, awesome!
2015-01-11 12:27:33	Yoshi2	I do love Python for things like this: https://github.com/RenolY2/py-playBMS/blob/master/OptionsCollector.py
2015-01-11 12:27:59	Yoshi2	I can set up default values for options by creating an instance of that class with keyword arguments
2015-01-11 12:28:43	Yoshi2	and I can overload the getattr method to make it possible to use options.key to access a particular key in the dictionary inside that class

2015-01-11 12:32:02	Yoshi2_	looks like my internet connection went into crap mode again
2015-01-11 12:32:11	@J	better is @property - lots of languages have __getattr__ equivalent, but @property is less common
2015-01-11 12:33:10	Yoshi2_	I have never looked into @property yet

2015-01-11 12:37:11	Yoshi2_	hmm, that does look quite useful
2015-01-11 12:38:20	Yoshi2_	but if I understood it correctly, it requires particular variables on which I use the @property decorator
2015-01-11 12:39:36	Yoshi2_	in my case, I just want a container for all options I might need which I can pass around everywhere
2015-01-11 12:44:20	@J	yeah, I'm not saying you should use it here, I'm saying it's a more unique feature of the language
2015-01-11 12:44:31	@J	wait
2015-01-11 12:44:37	@J	or maybe it was the other way around...
2015-01-11 12:44:42	@J	probably just ignore me
2015-01-11 12:44:46	@J	@property is useful anyway
2015-01-11 12:47:15	Yoshi2_	it definitely looks useful

2015-01-11 15:50:04	Yoshi2	ah, cool
2015-01-11 15:50:15	Yoshi2	sounds like something you could add to the section
2015-01-11 15:50:36	Waterpikmin	that the merchandise may need to be updated with the stuff from nintendo world
2015-01-11 15:50:56	Waterpikmin	let me look it up so i could get pictures
2015-01-11 15:52:00	Yoshi2	http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/ this store?

2015-01-11 15:57:15	Testyo	Hello! I was dropping by to see if any of you guys have to make one w/out showing my face n' stuff
2015-01-11 15:57:47	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-01-11 15:58:42	Yoshi2	I am honestly not sure if that is an automated message from the bot or if somebody actually made the bot say it
2015-01-11 15:58:49	Waterpikmin	i know
2015-01-11 15:58:57	Waterpikmin	idk what to do
2015-01-11 15:58:58	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-01-11 16:00:17	Waterpikmin	ok i checked again and i can confirm that they are not there
2015-01-11 16:00:27	Waterpikmin	so yay!
2015-01-11 16:00:53	Yoshi2	pikmin merchandise is a bit harder to come by, so I'm not too suprised
2015-01-11 16:01:13	Waterpikmin	dont even get me stared on that
2015-01-11 16:01:21	Yoshi2	at least here, no stores sell Pikmin stuff
2015-01-11 16:01:55	Waterpikmin	nintendo world is great
2015-01-11 16:02:09	Waterpikmin	it sells a ton of stuff
2015-01-11 16:02:15	Yoshi2	it definitely looks great, I wish I had such a store nearby
2015-01-11 16:02:25	Waterpikmin	but i didnt think it would sell that merch
2015-01-11 16:02:40	Waterpikmin	its not often you get pikmin merch from there
2015-01-11 16:04:04	Waterpikmin	oh wait!
2015-01-11 16:04:19	Waterpikmin	with the merge it actually has the plush that i got!
2015-01-11 16:04:32	Waterpikmin	so it is there its just not finalized
2015-01-11 16:05:11	Waterpikmin	so i guess it is there after all!
2015-01-11 16:05:27	Waterpikmin	on the merchandise/merge page
2015-01-11 16:05:48	Yoshi2	oh
2015-01-11 16:06:39	Waterpikmin	if you go on the merchandise merge page you can see it on the plush section the plush cups
2015-01-11 16:08:37	Waterpikmin	but i did see a typo on the merchandise page
2015-01-11 16:09:47	Waterpikmin	you there?
2015-01-11 16:09:49	Yoshi2	yep
2015-01-11 16:10:16	Yoshi2	mhm, yes
2015-01-11 16:10:34	Yoshi2	the plushies are in the merge page, but not in the normal page
2015-01-11 16:11:18	Waterpikmin	the typo says on the clothing section says "introduces" not "introduced"
2015-01-11 16:12:11	Waterpikmin	should something be done?
2015-01-11 16:12:15	Yoshi2	I can imagine that there are more typos hidden in the wiki
2015-01-11 16:12:32	Waterpikmin	oh definetly
2015-01-11 16:12:49	Yoshi2	*definitely
2015-01-11 16:12:51	Yoshi2	;)
2015-01-11 16:13:02	Waterpikmin	would i be able to edit the typo and lol thx
2015-01-11 16:13:36	Waterpikmin	all im doing is replacing one word so
2015-01-11 16:14:13	Waterpikmin	would that be a possibility?
2015-01-11 16:14:42	Yoshi2	Espyo could probably say more about that
2015-01-11 16:14:52	Waterpikmin	good ides
2015-01-11 16:14:56	Waterpikmin	idea*
2015-01-11 16:15:12	Waterpikmin	so all i have to do is say his name?
2015-01-11 16:15:19	Yoshi2	it should be possible, but I'm not too familiar with how things are done on the wiki
2015-01-11 16:15:31	Waterpikmin	okay, Espyo
2015-01-11 16:15:50	Waterpikmin	we need some assistance
2015-01-11 16:16:03	Yoshi2	he might be a bit busy, so don't expect a response right away
2015-01-11 16:16:14	Waterpikmin	of course
2015-01-11 16:16:16	Yoshi2	but it should speed things up a bit
2015-01-11 16:16:29	Waterpikmin	thats neat
2015-01-11 16:16:45	Yoshi2	because most IRC clients make the window flash when the user's own name is mentioned
2015-01-11 16:17:04	Waterpikmin	ok
2015-01-11 16:22:11	Waterpikmin	so im gonna play pikmin 2 for now
2015-01-11 16:25:33	@Espyo	hm?
2015-01-11 16:25:35	@Espyo	about what, sorry?
2015-01-11 16:25:40	@Espyo	I was playing Smash 4
2015-01-11 16:25:59	Yoshi2	<Waterpikmin> would i be able to edit the typo and lol thx
2015-01-11 16:25:59	Yoshi2	<Waterpikmin> all im doing is replacing one word so
2015-01-11 16:25:59	Yoshi2	<Waterpikmin> would that be a possibility?
2015-01-11 16:26:08	Yoshi2	Waterpikmin wants to correct a typo on the merchandise page
2015-01-11 16:27:39	@Espyo	yeah, sure
2015-01-11 16:27:43	@Espyo	anybody can edit any page

2015-01-11 16:35:41	Yoshi2	nice
2015-01-11 16:36:12	Waterpikmin	im going to go for a no death run on pikmin 2
2015-01-11 16:36:42	Yoshi2	that does sound very challenging
2015-01-11 16:36:51	Waterpikmin	it is
2015-01-11 16:37:12	Yoshi2	I think I lost close to all of my pikmins on my first fight with the first boss in the first cave
2015-01-11 16:37:20	Yoshi2	I ended up reloading the save to do it again
2015-01-11 16:37:40	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-01-11 16:37:49	Waterpikmin	its hard though
2015-01-11 16:38:09	Waterpikmin	if i fail ill just do a casual play through
2015-01-11 16:42:03	@Espyo	just remember you can always retry the floor you're on
2015-01-11 16:42:25	Waterpikmin	good point
2015-01-11 16:42:37	Waterpikmin	so ill slowly but surely complete the game
2015-01-11 16:43:28	Waterpikmin	its hard using the gamecube controls
2015-01-11 16:43:40	Waterpikmin	but i still love the original
2015-01-11 16:44:42	Yoshi2	I loved how in Pikmin 3 I could do lots of different things at once by telling each of my commanders to walk somewhere
2015-01-11 16:44:58	Yoshi2	I really miss that in Pikmin 2
2015-01-11 16:45:35	Waterpikmin	ya
2015-01-11 16:45:50	Waterpikmin	pikmin 2 always has a place in my heart
2015-01-11 16:55:11	Waterpikmin	i do think that pikmin 2 had the most exploration
2015-01-11 16:55:25	Waterpikmin	in size it was a large game

2015-01-11 21:28:30	UltraMario	I can play Pikmin 3 with a GC controller then
2015-01-11 21:28:32	UltraMario	<3
2015-01-11 21:28:39	UltraMario	cuz I have a mayflash adapter
2015-01-11 21:28:54	UltraMario	that works like a classic controller
2015-01-11 21:29:06	UltraMario	you plug the adapter in the wii remote, then plug your GC controller in the adapter
2015-01-11 21:29:17	UltraMario	and it should work with any classic controller supported game
2015-01-11 21:29:27	UltraMario	in that regard it's better than the official gamecube adapter

2015-01-11 22:11:03	@J	so you can watch the actual streams any time
2015-01-11 22:11:47	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-11 22:11:55	@Espyo	never really thought of that
2015-01-11 22:12:06	@Espyo	though I thought you had to manually enable the safekeepings
2015-01-11 22:13:16	Miles	People have uploaded everything to YouTube if you search
2015-01-11 22:13:40	Miles	And yeah it raised around 1.5 million
2015-01-11 22:13:50	Miles	Over 1 million last year
2015-01-11 22:14:07	@Espyo	good
2015-01-11 22:15:42	@J	not really sure, I think I just checked at some point and they were all in some sort of archive
2015-01-11 22:16:04	Miles	Yeah everything's on Twitch but it's not the most convenient way to find/watch them
2015-01-11 22:16:10	Miles	As they're not split by run
2015-01-11 22:16:21	@J	fair enough

2015-01-13 19:54:29	UltraMario	and I love Audiosurf, so I would probably like this game too
2015-01-13 19:54:44	Waterpikmin	look at the trailer
2015-01-13 19:55:00	UltraMario	of what?
2015-01-13 19:55:35	Waterpikmin	dont starve
2015-01-13 19:55:43	UltraMario	no
2015-01-13 19:55:52	Waterpikmin	why?
2015-01-13 19:56:02	@Espyo	<J> 165 days of uptime
2015-01-13 19:56:07	UltraMario	i'm not even interested in it, I've only heard the title :P
2015-01-13 19:56:10	@Espyo	I still remember when windows 95 exploded after 30 days of uptime
2015-01-13 19:56:13	@Espyo	or something like that
2015-01-13 19:56:15	@Espyo	also hi, everybody
2015-01-13 19:56:26	Waterpikmin	ok lol
2015-01-13 19:56:30	Waterpikmin	hi espyo!
2015-01-13 19:56:44	UltraMario	too bad none of my steam friends have Melody's escape
2015-01-13 19:56:54	UltraMario	I have no one to tell me what it's like :P
2015-01-13 19:58:05	Waterpikmin	i havent heard of that one
2015-01-13 19:59:44	UltraMario	i found it through my steam reccomendations
2015-01-13 19:59:55	Waterpikmin	hmm
2015-01-13 20:00:11	Waterpikmin	dont starve has a ton of replayability
2015-01-13 20:00:20	Waterpikmin	especially with steam workshop
2015-01-13 20:00:39	Waterpikmin	ive been playing it for a while now and i havent played it with one mod
2015-01-13 20:01:19	Yoshi2	I have skyrim
2015-01-13 20:01:26	Yoshi2	tons of replayability with mods and stuff

2015-01-13 20:07:23	Yoshi2	the game is alright, too bad that it is lacking a bit in depth because the world is so big
2015-01-13 20:07:40	Yoshi2	that's where mods make the game better
2015-01-13 20:08:00	Yoshi2	though I did put 100 hours into the game before I even thought about trying out some mods
2015-01-13 20:08:05	UltraMario	i wish sonic generatios had workshop compatability
2015-01-13 20:09:16	Waterpikmin	i have never completed the game so i want to have more playability

2015-01-14 20:47:16	Yoshi2	I did find it stupid how Wind Waker had a pre-rendered credits video
2015-01-14 20:50:04	Yoshi2	which wouldn't be too bad, but Nintendo also made the cutszene before the credits (or after?) pre-rendered, too

2015-01-15 18:49:07	Testyo	because I guess last time I went through and too subtle might look dumb too
2015-01-15 18:53:34	@Espyo	hi
2015-01-15 19:05:13	Miles	So Winged Pikmin aren't called "Winged" in the files
2015-01-15 19:05:22	Miles	You get 3 guesses to what they are called
2015-01-15 19:05:43	Miles	It does use Rock though
2015-01-15 19:07:15	Yoshi2	hmmm, did Pikmin 2 have winged Pikmin?
2015-01-15 19:08:35	Miles	No
2015-01-15 19:10:20	Yoshi2	my guess would be something with "purple", but the big pikmin is purple too
2015-01-15 19:10:34	Yoshi2	maybe they fixed the purple pikmin's name and named the winged pikmin black
2015-01-15 19:10:51	Miles	Purples are still "Black"
2015-01-15 19:12:43	Yoshi2	in that case, maybe the Winged Pikmin are "Fly"
2015-01-15 19:12:56	Miles	No
2015-01-15 19:15:47	Yoshi2	and it probably isn't "Purple" either?

2015-01-15 19:34:28	UltraMario	how did you rip files from the wii u? :|
2015-01-15 19:34:57	UltraMario	also lol yellow wollywog's japanese name is apparently simply "frog"
2015-01-15 19:35:15	Miles	These are code names, not Japanese names
2015-01-15 19:35:33	Miles	I didn't rip them myself, someone else did and sent them to me
2015-01-15 19:35:34	UltraMario	oh, well the other names were japanese, so. :P
2015-01-15 19:35:43	Miles	buriko, clione, iwadama, kakureimo, kingchappy, kumo, marofrog, moguraimo

2015-01-15 19:36:03	@Espyo	clione is the Honeywisp
2015-01-15 19:36:15	UltraMario	i guess it's a sub-species of wollywog
2015-01-15 19:38:06	Miles	Well, it's obvious what some of them are from Pikmin 2, but... Going to leave them blank for that .1% chance they're not
2015-01-15 19:38:25	Miles	And also because they're unused
2015-01-15 19:38:54	Miles	Man, I really want to view their models
2015-01-15 19:40:58	UltraMario	ask the guy who sent you them
2015-01-15 19:42:21	Miles	Being able to rip a game doesn't mean they have a magic way of viewing models
2015-01-15 19:43:10	UltraMario	well there's programs for that :P
2015-01-15 19:43:27	UltraMario	i mean someone was able to rip the models from hyrule warriors, so

2015-01-15 19:58:04	@Espyo	doesn't Brawl use a model format like that? it sure is familiar

2015-01-15 19:58:47	@Espyo	well, I mean, duh, of course they are

2015-01-15 19:59:57	Miles	That's an end-of-day message, which I haven't seen most of, so I would have no clue if they were unused or not
2015-01-15 20:00:33	@Espyo	some of the wikians have a list of the ones they found
2015-01-15 20:00:35	@Espyo	I'll ask 'em
2015-01-15 20:00:51	Miles	I mean, I would go with "it's not unused"
2015-01-15 20:01:11	@Espyo	US or EU?
2015-01-15 20:01:12	Miles	Just, make up your minds on how Hocotate is pronounced please
2015-01-15 20:01:14	Miles	US
2015-01-15 20:01:31	Miles	The EU script is actually also included, lol
2015-01-15 20:01:59	@Espyo	reminds me of Pik2 stuff
2015-01-15 20:02:03	@Espyo	they also have everything in all versions
2015-01-15 20:02:10	@Espyo	wonder if that one's EU script is outdated
2015-01-15 20:02:20	@Espyo	I didn't really reflect that much on what you said, let me go back
2015-01-15 20:02:28	@Espyo	Nintendo has BOTH scripts in the US version
2015-01-15 20:02:32	@Espyo	just why
2015-01-15 20:03:21	@Espyo	L3re7z is saying that that end of day log is used
2015-01-15 20:04:39	Miles	Hocotatians. 
2015-01-15 20:04:39	Miles	According to my Grandpa they're a very advanced civilization. They apparently have a highly refined taste for the arts, and he told me that many of them love to collect ancient artwork and artefacts. Perhaps the Hocotatian who's been leaving notes on this planet came here in search of that kind of treasure? 
2015-01-15 20:05:02	@Espyo	EU equivalent?
2015-01-15 20:05:04	Miles	Yeah
2015-01-15 20:05:33	@Espyo	neat
2015-01-15 20:05:37	@Espyo	that IS a bit familiar to me
2015-01-15 20:05:42	@Espyo	but yeah, it's pretty much used
2015-01-15 20:05:47	@Espyo	there have to be some unused ones
2015-01-15 20:05:54	Miles	The best ones
2015-01-15 20:05:56	@Espyo	I mean, if the enemies are anything to go by, this looks promissing
2015-01-15 20:05:59	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-15 20:06:06	Miles	There's two for if you rescue the Winged/Blue Onions
2015-01-15 20:06:12	Miles	But don't actually pluck the seed
2015-01-15 20:06:32	@Espyo	amazing
2015-01-15 20:06:35	Miles	Also the unused enemies aren't in the script, so...
2015-01-15 20:06:43	@Espyo	crap
2015-01-15 20:07:01	@Espyo	but they DO have models, is that it?
2015-01-15 20:07:35	@Espyo	I do know there's a different log if you see the cell phone but don't fight the Meerslug
2015-01-15 20:07:42	@Espyo	somebody posted on the wiki at one point
2015-01-15 20:09:19	Miles	We built a bridge and freed the pink Onion, from which a single Pikmin seed popped out. However, I completely forgot to pluck the Pikmin sprout out of the ground , so I'm still not quite sure what abilities these pink Pikmin possess. 
2015-01-15 20:09:33	Miles	They have models, but their file sizes are relatively small
2015-01-15 20:10:08	@Espyo	pfffthahaha
2015-01-15 20:10:21	@Espyo	aw, they might really be Pikmin 2 leftovers then
2015-01-15 20:10:31	@Espyo	I mean, I think you mean they're small in comparison to the used ones
2015-01-15 20:24:39	Miles	I don't know where most of the Pikmin/Captain parameters are...
2015-01-15 20:24:52	Miles	Only thing I've found is a file just for attack strength/throw height
2015-01-15 20:25:19	Miles	(and completely unsurprisingly their attack matches up with what I already thought they were)
2015-01-15 20:25:32	@Espyo	how did you know the exact units, though?
2015-01-15 20:25:36	@Espyo	I thought you got the numbers by comparing
2015-01-15 20:25:43	Miles	Because it's the same as Pikmin 1 and 2
2015-01-15 20:25:46	@Espyo	oh
2015-01-15 20:25:48	@Espyo	well, that makes sense
2015-01-15 20:26:01	@Espyo	wait, I thought it was radically different in P1
2015-01-15 20:26:07	Miles	It's not
2015-01-15 20:26:11	@Espyo	at least a Bulborb's HP is really different
2015-01-15 20:26:24	@Espyo	and they kinda take the same time to die
2015-01-15 20:26:30	Miles	Reds have always been 15, Blues/Yellows have always been 10
2015-01-15 20:26:37	@Espyo	eh, I take it back, their HP isn't THAT different

2015-01-15 20:52:05	Yoshi2	if you listen to the music track from the bingo mode and disable all tracks except for the one where pikmin cheer for Olimar, you can hear how Hocotate is pronounced
2015-01-15 20:52:15	Yoshi2	very quickly
2015-01-15 20:52:33	@Espyo	yep
2015-01-15 20:52:55	Yoshi2	which kinda makes civilization and hocotatians rhyme
2015-01-15 20:52:57	@Espyo	it's also pronounced Hoe-koe-tah-tay by Palutena in Smash 4
2015-01-15 20:53:08	@Espyo	kinda rhyme
2015-01-15 20:54:02	Yoshi2	civilizaischian, hocotateyschian
2015-01-15 20:54:19	Yoshi2	if you know what I'm getting at
2015-01-15 20:55:24	Miles	...I don't see how that rhymes with civilization
2015-01-15 20:56:38	Yoshi2	well, I'd need to write those weird symbols which are usually used to define pronounciation of words
2015-01-15 20:57:56	Yoshi2	the way I did it just now probably is rather unprecise because it can vary depending on how you usually pronounce the words/letters
2015-01-15 20:58:57	Miles	"te" is not included in Hocotatian, so that part shouldn't be pronounced, right?
2015-01-15 21:00:21	Yoshi2	if you pronounced "-tian" in a similar way to civilization's "-tion", you would end up with something similar to a rhyme
2015-01-15 21:00:59	Miles	If you're really, really stretching, sure
2015-01-15 21:01:06	@Espyo	you have to kind of say it fast
2015-01-15 21:01:06	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-01-15 21:01:11	@Espyo	but at least the "ian" match
2015-01-15 21:01:39	Yoshi2	yeah, hocotate needs to be pronounced quickly
2015-01-15 21:02:33	Yoshi2	similar to when the Pikmin cheer on Olimar in the bingo mode
2015-01-15 21:04:52	Miles	But that's only if "Hocotate" and "Hocotatian" are pronounced the same way
2015-01-15 21:08:28	Yoshi2	considering that you would pronounce German in a similar way to Germany, and Russian in a similiar way to Russia, I would guess that Hocotatian is pronounced in a similar way to Hocotate
2015-01-15 21:09:20	Yoshi2	not that it makes too much sense, but Pikmin 3 has no voice actors except for the person who reads the intro and outro
2015-01-15 21:10:31	Miles	Germany contains German, Russian contains Russia, Hocotatian does not contain Hocotate (the e at the end is left out)
2015-01-15 21:13:35	Yoshi2	you could try to explain it with English being weird and the e being replaced with i
2015-01-15 21:13:56	Yoshi2	considering what weird stuff can happen in languages, that wouldn't be too far fetched

2015-01-15 21:52:28	@Espyo	anyway, compared to must other DRM, Steam is pretty good
2015-01-15 21:52:36	@Espyo	worst you can get is a stupid infinite-update cycle
2015-01-15 21:53:00	@J	actually, some Steam games are DRM-free, aren't they?
2015-01-15 21:53:09	@Espyo	they should be
2015-01-15 21:53:09	@J	you just launch them from SteamApps or something
2015-01-15 21:53:14	@Espyo	but Steam itself is still in the way

2015-01-15 21:53:28	Yoshi2	some games might complain if steam isn't running
2015-01-15 21:53:29	@Espyo	played with bots, sure, but I did it
2015-01-15 21:55:06	@J	yeah, depends on the game

2015-01-16 22:27:13	Yoshi2	how even
2015-01-16 22:28:10	Yoshi2	I am not sure why the developer would put a html page in the game files
2015-01-16 22:28:40	@Espyo	according to the article body, they didn't
2015-01-16 22:28:45	@Espyo	RAM content leaked in
2015-01-16 22:29:47	Yoshi2	I see
2015-01-16 22:30:26	Yoshi2	I wonder how building a game would leak ram into the build
2015-01-16 22:31:11	@Espyo	I have no idea
2015-01-16 22:31:14	@Espyo	so I'm pretty skeptical myself
2015-01-16 22:31:29	Yoshi2	maybe ram isn't being cleared completely, and when the build program reserves X memory for building the game, it ends up reading data that was left in the ram
2015-01-16 22:35:00	@Espyo	yeah, but nothing ever had that
2015-01-16 22:37:38	Yoshi2	without a doubt, there is a rom with the content described on that tcrf page
2015-01-16 22:39:32	Yoshi2	I do wonder about the origin of the prototype
2015-01-16 22:39:45	Yoshi2	was it dumped by somebody from a cartridge?
2015-01-16 22:47:14	@Espyo	probably
2015-01-16 22:51:09	Yoshi2	considering that prototypes are rather rare, if whoever dumped it messed up the dump process, that version would be the only one in circulation and you would have no way of checking if the cartridge is supposed to contain the data or not

2015-01-17 19:51:08	@Espyo	like, if there were file names for those types of pellets, that means they were at least added on purpose
2015-01-17 19:51:13	@Espyo	so we can exclude "lighting glitch"
2015-01-17 19:51:29	@Espyo	could still be a glitch for them to appear where they shouldn't, but at least it wouldn't really be a lighting glitch

2015-01-17 21:35:45	Yoshi2	Espyo: something is missing here: "It seems they planned on the Harpy being one of the enemy types in Medusa's lair at one point, but didn't get of her model when they removed her from the arena."
2015-01-17 21:35:58	Yoshi2	I think it is the " but didn't get of her model " part
2015-01-17 21:36:16	Yoshi2	probably needs to be "didn't get rid of her model"
2015-01-17 21:36:39	Yoshi2	but I think it can be worded in a better way
2015-01-17 21:39:01	Yoshi2	also, the rest of the text says nothing about who "they" is, so I think it would be good to make it more precise

2015-01-18 12:10:18	@Espyo	hi
2015-01-18 12:10:26	@Espyo	hm... performance...
2015-01-18 12:10:34	Yoshi2_	it was painful, but I recreated my yesterday's wiki changes

2015-01-18 12:28:35	@Espyo	bad thing about rewritting: wasted work and you always forget something
2015-01-18 12:28:48	@Espyo	good thing: stuff you wrote before that you weren't happy with before is now a million times better
2015-01-18 12:29:03	@Espyo	(too many "before"s, oops)
2015-01-18 12:38:02	Yoshi2_	indeed
2015-01-18 12:38:28	Yoshi2_	replace "stuff that you wrote" with "stuff that somebody else wrote"
2015-01-18 12:38:36	Yoshi2_	and you have my situation
2015-01-18 12:38:52	@Espyo	oh, I meant YOUR rewritting
2015-01-18 12:39:03	@Espyo	like, you having to rewrite what you already wrote yesterday, before the browser crash
2015-01-18 12:39:17	Yoshi2_	ah
2015-01-18 12:39:23	@Espyo	hehe
2015-01-18 12:42:06	Yoshi2_	well, I don't think it applies to lost work very well
2015-01-18 12:42:27	Yoshi2_	I end up feeling "Let's just get over with this"
2015-01-18 12:42:49	Yoshi2_	and I don't remember too well how I worded some things yesterday, so I end up writing it in a different way
2015-01-18 12:45:26	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-18 12:45:30	@Espyo	still, it was lost effort
2015-01-18 12:45:38	@Espyo	I mean, before the crash
2015-01-18 12:45:44	@Espyo	it was effort... that was lost
2015-01-18 12:46:26	Yoshi2_	yes
2015-01-18 12:48:08	Yoshi2_	and I just realized that I introduced a typo into the text where there wasn't a typo before

2015-01-18 18:11:24	@J	so there are some Dustforce user-made levels that are just all the levels from whole sections of the main game stuck together, 12 each
2015-01-18 18:11:54	@J	it's demoralising to see some times on the leaderboards that are faster than my IL times added up
2015-01-18 18:12:27	@J	especially since to get the top rank anyway you have to do a faultless run, on a 8+-minute level
2015-01-18 18:14:57	@Espyo	ouch
2015-01-18 18:15:04	@Espyo	although you did say the first part before
2015-01-18 18:15:16	@J	oh, really?
2015-01-18 18:15:27	@J	I didn't even remember seeing these before
2015-01-18 18:15:40	@J	great memory
2015-01-18 18:16:07	Yoshi2_	I don't remember J saying the first part
2015-01-18 18:16:21	@Espyo	pretty sure
2015-01-18 18:16:25	Yoshi2_	so that is 2 vs 1, maybe Espyo is hallucinating
2015-01-18 18:16:25	@Espyo	probably
2015-01-18 18:16:43	Yoshi2_	either that, or I also have faulty memory (or wasn't here when it was said)

2015-01-19 20:23:59	@PikFan	this kirby fellow is rather persistent

2015-01-19 20:24:26	Yoshi2	on the wiki?
2015-01-19 20:24:45	@PikFan	why can he not understand the concept of us leaving the wikia host behind?!
2015-01-19 20:24:58	@PikFan	(user on the wikia site)
2015-01-19 20:25:39	@PikFan	there is no need, absolutely no need at all to keep something alive when it should be dead
2015-01-19 20:25:55	@PikFan	he needs to let go

2015-01-19 20:27:02	Yoshi2	let it go
2015-01-19 20:27:43	Yoshi2	considering that there is a replacement for the wikia host already, there really isn't any reason to use wikia
2015-01-19 20:27:49	Yoshi2	it's not like the wiki stops existing
2015-01-19 20:28:03	@PikFan	even though I'm not part of the conversation, it still angers me that someone would rather try to keep a pointless, worthless host up instead of moving to the new one
2015-01-19 20:28:51	@PikFan	does this guy have mental issues or something?
2015-01-19 20:29:32	@PikFan	it should be clear by now, yet he still cannot comprehend a simple message!

2015-01-19 20:29:56	Yoshi2	does he try to explain why he thinks that the old host should be kept?
2015-01-19 20:30:39	@PikFan	here's the discussion: http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:22034
2015-01-19 20:38:59	Yoshi2	that is a very odd person
2015-01-19 20:39:34	@PikFan	indeed
2015-01-19 20:40:29	Yoshi2	it shouldn't really be that difficult to understand that this wiki is being abandoned on purpose, and all the content has been moved over
2015-01-19 20:43:25	@PikFan	yeah, but he keeps insisting that it be kept alive
2015-01-19 20:43:52	@Espyo	I might've landed the final nail on the coffin
2015-01-19 20:44:05	@Espyo	now that he brought up the "I don't want people to think Pikmin fans suck" point
2015-01-19 20:44:10	@Espyo	I was able to explain to him better
2015-01-19 20:44:18	@Espyo	in a... mindset? he's more comfortable with
2015-01-19 20:45:34	Yoshi2	ah yes, the mindset of somebody who leads a revolution against the oppressive regime
2015-01-19 20:45:35	@PikFan	hopefully...
2015-01-19 20:46:29	Yoshi2	though to be honest, I found your text rather difficult to understand
2015-01-19 20:46:42	@PikFan	none of this would have happened if not for wikia's decision four and a half years ago

2015-01-19 20:47:23	@Espyo	I meant the "don't want Pikmin fans to be seen badly" mindset
2015-01-19 20:47:26	@PikFan	they enforced a new layout many people hated
2015-01-19 20:47:48	@PikFan	so a lot of communities left
2015-01-19 20:47:59	@Espyo	oh, Yoshi2 doesn't know the story?
2015-01-19 20:48:02	@Espyo	that's the gist of it
2015-01-19 20:48:06	@Espyo	[[Pikipedia:About]]
2015-01-19 20:48:06	Testyo	"Pikipedia:About" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:About
2015-01-19 20:48:19	@Espyo	that explains more, but it's still small
2015-01-19 20:48:24	@Espyo	well, not like the full story adds anything
2015-01-19 20:48:25	@PikFan	yeah, that's putting it mildly...
2015-01-19 20:48:34	@Espyo	it's like the full story could fit into a feature-length BOOK
2015-01-19 20:48:42	@Espyo	but nobody really wants that, and it's not really needed
2015-01-19 20:48:51	@PikFan	probably a novella
2015-01-19 20:49:16	@Espyo	yep
2015-01-19 20:50:19	Yoshi2	is the layout that can now be seen on wikia pages the one they adopted?
2015-01-19 20:50:29	@PikFan	but if wikia had let the communities choose on a per-wiki basis if the new layout could be implemented or not, lots of people would have been happy
2015-01-19 20:50:36	@PikFan	although...
2015-01-19 20:50:50	@PikFan	being away from wikia has its benefits
2015-01-19 20:51:10	@PikFan	so maybe it was a good thing that wikia didn't let us choose
2015-01-19 20:51:20	@PikFan	in a sense, anyway
2015-01-19 20:51:46	@PikFan	it still caused unneeded chaos
2015-01-19 20:52:09	Yoshi2	I don't remember wikia ever having a different layout, but I always found the layout it had to be rather odd
2015-01-19 20:52:23	Yoshi2	there is nothing wrong with the usual wikipedia-style layout
2015-01-19 20:53:36	@PikFan	wikia used to use the classic monobook layout
2015-01-19 20:53:56	@PikFan	then they introduced the 'Wikia' layout
2015-01-19 20:54:32	@PikFan	meanwhile, I'm waiting for my laptop to start up
2015-01-19 20:54:41	@PikFan	it's got a bad virus
2015-01-19 20:54:56	@PikFan	no clue what it is though
2015-01-19 20:57:22	Yoshi2	my biggest fear is that I have a virus and just don't know it yet
2015-01-19 20:57:35	@Espyo	tell me about it
2015-01-19 20:57:44	@Espyo	there's this Steam virus that's been around for... well, apparently, years
2015-01-19 20:57:51	@Espyo	and I actually fell for it in a moment of perfect distraction
2015-01-19 20:57:54	@Espyo	luckily it's a stupid virus
2015-01-19 20:58:05	 *	@PikFan laughs nervously
2015-01-19 20:58:05	@Espyo	I just had to boot into safe mode to remove the .src, and all was good
2015-01-19 20:58:09	Yoshi2	but virus scans never show anything and I don't feel anything odd when using the computer
2015-01-19 20:58:11	@Espyo	...but what if I just THINK it's all good
2015-01-19 20:58:15	@Espyo	same here
2015-01-19 20:58:32	@Espyo	and I use MalwareBytes and Spybot, the two best free ones
2015-01-19 20:58:51	@Espyo	...but then I fear the viruses infected the AVs and masked themselves
2015-01-19 20:59:05	@Espyo	no symptoms yet... until I start dishing out credit card numbers on stuff I buy online
2015-01-19 20:59:07	@Espyo	and then one day...
2015-01-19 20:59:09	@Espyo	*shudder*
2015-01-19 20:59:14	@Espyo	I'm pretty safe with internet stuff
2015-01-19 20:59:19	@Espyo	and c'mon, I'm "a computer guy"
2015-01-19 20:59:23	@Espyo	I don't fall for crap easily
2015-01-19 20:59:25	@Espyo	but still
2015-01-19 20:59:28	@PikFan	everything goes to hell
2015-01-19 21:00:04	Yoshi2	the worst will happen when you expect it the least
2015-01-19 21:00:24	Yoshi2	I'm still waiting for my desktop to die and the HDD to crash
2015-01-19 21:00:28	Yoshi2	but nope, still going strong
2015-01-19 21:00:43	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-19 21:00:58	Yoshi2	6 or 7 years old now, that's far past the usual age of when HDDs normally crash
2015-01-19 21:21:27	@J	in my experience desktop HDDs last a long time, laptop ones not so much, probably because of too much heat
2015-01-19 21:22:03	@J	desktops in general seem to last at least 3 times as long as laptops
2015-01-19 21:24:15	@J	I think I'll have no trouble with malware by mostly using programs that probably 0.000001% of the population uses
2015-01-19 21:24:40	@J	in some cases that's not even an exaggeration
2015-01-19 21:26:13	Yoshi2	programs you wrote yourself?
2015-01-19 21:26:28	@J	yep
2015-01-19 21:27:19	@J	for 'core' software, bspwm, jsession and uzbl are probably the most obscure
2015-01-19 21:28:05	Yoshi2	those sound like somebody typed up a random combination of letters
2015-01-19 21:28:18	@J	yes
2015-01-19 21:28:53	@J	so do most acronyms, though
2015-01-19 21:30:19	Yoshi2	bspwm apparently is a window manager, uzbl is some sort of collection of tools?
2015-01-19 21:31:25	Yoshi2	but google fails to provide me with a satisfactory explanation to jsession in the first 30 seconds of searching
2015-01-19 21:31:43	@J	I guess I use uzbl-browser, really
2015-01-19 21:31:51	@J	that's the only real thing anyone made with uzbl
2015-01-19 21:32:00	@J	and the thing it was made for
2015-01-19 21:32:19	@J	jsession is a desktop session manager I wrote
2015-01-19 21:32:58	Yoshi2	that explains why google didn't find much about it
2015-01-19 21:34:26	@J	thanks
2015-01-19 21:34:54	Yoshi2	obscurity confirmed, I guess
2015-01-19 21:36:01	@Espyo	*hipster
2015-01-19 21:36:02	 *	@Espyo leaves
2015-01-19 21:36:36	@J	wait, what are you correcting?
2015-01-19 21:37:07	@PikFan	J: you use antimalware programs you wrote yourself?
2015-01-19 21:37:10	@PikFan	rad
2015-01-19 21:37:18	@J	no, I use programs
2015-01-19 21:37:41	@J	the point was malware won't exist that targets programs used by hardly anyone
2015-01-19 21:38:06	@J	and when those programs include major entry points, like the web browser
2015-01-19 21:38:40	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> obscurity confirmed, I guess
2015-01-19 21:38:44	@Espyo	hipster confirmed, I guess
2015-01-19 21:38:54	@J	silly
2015-01-19 21:39:03	@Espyo	I don't think malware targets programs
2015-01-19 21:39:08	@Espyo	it targets pretty much the system
2015-01-19 21:39:15	@Espyo	or /any/ file, not specific ones
2015-01-19 21:39:49	@PikFan	..."malware won't exist that targets programs"?
2015-01-19 21:40:07	@J	browser was the main one
2015-01-19 21:40:13	@PikFan	either I can't think right or there is something very wrong with that statement
2015-01-19 21:40:24	@J	I think you missed some of my words?
2015-01-19 21:40:34	@J	malware _does_ exist that targets browsers
2015-01-19 21:41:00	@PikFan	13:40	J	the point was malware won't exist that targets programs used by hardly anyone
2015-01-19 21:41:13	@J	yeah, 'used by hardly anyone' is the important part
2015-01-19 21:41:51	@PikFan	right
2015-01-19 21:46:14	@PikFan	laptop's not working, and I want to play Hyrule Warriors now

2015-01-22 20:16:43	@J	yeah
2015-01-22 20:16:58	@Espyo	someone should make a change so the server has to give you something different
2015-01-22 20:17:03	@Espyo	or, you know, you can toggle one of the options
2015-01-22 20:17:05	@Espyo	tried that?

2015-01-22 20:18:28	@Espyo	randomly, huh

2015-01-22 22:57:56	@J	uh...wrong window
2015-01-22 23:01:51	@Espyo	that'll probably give a syntax error
2015-01-22 23:02:16	@J	it was in VLC
2015-01-22 23:02:57	@Espyo	even worse
2015-01-22 23:03:13	@J	why
2015-01-22 23:03:45	@Espyo	that's not a video
2015-01-22 23:03:49	@Espyo	were you trying to do ASCII art?
2015-01-22 23:05:12	@J	I don't get it
2015-01-22 23:05:24	@J	you don't make videos in VLC
2015-01-22 23:07:52	@J	oh, I get it
2015-01-22 23:08:07	@J	it wasn't a filename, it's space to pause, = to set speed to 1x, etc.
2015-01-22 23:08:23	@J	...and I wasn't looking at the screen, and it wasn't working, so I pressed more stuff
2015-01-22 23:11:34	@Espyo	oh
2015-01-22 23:11:35	@Espyo	fair enough
2015-01-22 23:11:41	@Espyo	hah
2015-01-22 23:13:55	@J	well, got to go

2015-01-23 19:56:23	@Espyo	hey
2015-01-23 19:56:26	@Espyo	windows 8 updated yesterday
2015-01-23 19:56:35	@Espyo	today, it forgot that it was meant to log on to my user automatically
2015-01-23 19:56:49	@Espyo	because, you know, it's not like auto-login isn't a basic functionality or anything
2015-01-23 19:57:01	@Espyo	I'm seriously considering starting a journal
2015-01-23 19:57:10	@Espyo	every day, I point down the windowsness of the day
2015-01-23 19:57:31	@Espyo	for as far back as I can remember, there hasn't been a single day in which windows didn't do something idiotic
2015-01-23 20:06:05	@J	all complex software is buggy
2015-01-23 20:06:31	@J	solution is to only make simple software
2015-01-23 20:19:43	@Espyo	amateur mistakes from a major company are never forgivable, though
2015-01-23 20:20:08	@Espyo	plus what really stings me is how people praise windows for being a god given digital flesh
2015-01-23 20:20:14	@Espyo	when I'm struggling to get anything done

2015-01-24 13:04:22	@Espyo	J leaked his password at least three times
2015-01-24 13:04:31	@Espyo	but now his password is auto-corrected to something irrelevant
2015-01-24 13:04:36	@Espyo	in the case he does post it
2015-01-24 13:04:40	@Espyo	and well done J
2015-01-24 13:04:42	@Espyo	how many weeks did it take
2015-01-24 13:07:56	@J	hmm, not sure really
2015-01-24 13:08:09	@J	I did that and some of the harder ones, then went back to easier levels for a while
2015-01-24 13:08:21	@J	then I did custom levels, many of which are quite hard
2015-01-24 13:08:28	@J	and came back to this one and it was easier
2015-01-24 13:09:01	@J	still has two really annoying parts, though, you need really accurate timing
2015-01-24 13:15:47	@J	on an unrelated note, I've spent this morning reading through some of my old notes and writings - games, poem, stories
2015-01-24 13:15:52	@J	there's some interesting stuff in there
2015-01-24 13:16:26	@J	not sure I should've been using so many semi-colons at the age of 9, though
2015-01-24 13:20:00	@Espyo	if you think you're using too many semicolons, chances are you did; they're easy to abuse
2015-01-24 13:29:00	Yoshi2	the auto-correct thing is actually not bad
2015-01-24 13:29:56	@J	my actual password starts with /, which is the easy way to do it
2015-01-24 13:29:58	@J	it does this:

2015-01-24 17:06:12	@Espyo	unless I tell it to
2015-01-24 17:06:23	@Espyo	it just silently observes my file changes and uploads them to the cloud

2015-01-24 17:06:37	@Espyo	like I did with .git

2015-01-24 17:10:07	@J	yesterday someone at work lost their stash because their computer randomly rebooted overnight
2015-01-24 17:10:12	@Espyo	but the stash apply still has errors
2015-01-24 17:10:14	@Espyo	wait what
2015-01-24 17:10:16	@Espyo	why?
2015-01-24 17:10:18	@Espyo	it's not in RAM
2015-01-24 17:10:21	@Espyo	a stash should be on disk
2015-01-24 17:10:22	@Espyo	what
2015-01-24 17:10:34	@J	I mean, the repository got corrupted
2015-01-24 17:10:43	@Espyo	still, how?
2015-01-24 17:10:47	@J	because Windows
2015-01-24 17:10:47	@Espyo	did it reboot mid-stashing process?
2015-01-24 17:11:02	@J	yeah, no idea what was actually using it, if anything
2015-01-24 17:11:12	@Espyo	*shrug*, the usual
2015-01-24 17:11:26	@Espyo	it fails to apply the stash, complaining some files already exist
2015-01-24 17:11:27	@J	anyway, the IDE we use saves all changes to all project files forever, so he could restore from before he stashed
2015-01-24 17:11:36	@Espyo	...I know? I'm applying stashed changes, not stashed creations or anything
2015-01-24 17:11:45	@Espyo	oh, that's neat
2015-01-24 17:12:16	@J	it should still apply all the changes it can, then let you merge manually, right?
2015-01-24 17:12:28	@Espyo	yeah, it should
2015-01-24 17:12:33	@Espyo	but it looks like it just doesn't apply anything
2015-01-24 17:13:10	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-01-24 17:13:16	@Espyo	it's actually complaining about files I DO have
2015-01-24 17:13:25	@Espyo	and I guess I DID *ADD* those files
2015-01-24 17:13:28	@Espyo	like
2015-01-24 17:13:35	@Espyo	version -> added some files -> stashed
2015-01-24 17:13:44	@Espyo	and it's complaining because it wants to readd the files, and they exist
2015-01-24 17:13:50	@Espyo	now as to why they exist, it's probably Dropbox shenanigans
2015-01-24 17:13:52	@Espyo	boy...
2015-01-24 17:15:14	@J	git reset --hard and git clean -f if it's safe
2015-01-24 17:15:25	@Espyo	probably not
2015-01-24 17:15:30	@Espyo	no worries anyway, I think I've got it
2015-01-24 17:15:34	@Espyo	I can just delete the files
2015-01-24 17:15:39	@Espyo	what does the -f flag do on clean?
2015-01-24 17:15:43	@J	force
2015-01-24 17:15:53	@J	you have to pass -f or -i (interactive) or another one I forget
2015-01-24 17:16:59	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-24 17:17:06	@Espyo	oh, wait, I'm fine now
2015-01-24 17:17:11	@Espyo	phew
2015-01-24 17:18:46	@Espyo	oh, at work, they frown upon pull
2015-01-24 17:18:50	@Espyo	instead they prefer fetch and rebase
2015-01-24 17:20:15	@J	pull --rebase
2015-01-24 17:20:33	@J	but only if you didn't merge another branch locally
2015-01-24 17:21:49	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-24 17:21:57	@Espyo	I'll try telling them that
2015-01-24 17:23:30	@J	pull --rebase is just shorthand
2015-01-24 17:23:48	@Espyo	oh
2015-01-24 17:24:11	@J	but yeah, rebase replays the commits, so you only want to do it if all new local commits are _only_ in this branch
2015-01-24 17:24:22	@J	ie. all commits in 'git cherry'
2015-01-24 17:24:49	@J	otherwise you'll get duplicates of all those commits, and any merge involving duplicates will have the commits conflict with themselves
2015-01-24 17:24:54	@J	which is horrible to resolve
2015-01-24 17:25:26	@Espyo	ouch
2015-01-24 17:25:27	@J	rather than 'rebase instead of merge', it should be 'merge unless you know what you're doing'
2015-01-24 17:27:36	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-24 17:27:46	@Espyo	but they just don't like the idea of having their history be all curvy
2015-01-24 17:27:51	@Espyo	they like it as a straight line
2015-01-24 17:29:11	@J	silly

2015-01-24 17:37:05	Yoshi2_	dropbox deletting the local folder if you tell it to stop synching something has annoyed me in the past very much
2015-01-24 17:37:21	@Espyo	mhm

2015-01-24 17:40:45	Yoshi2_	I wonder what the point of it is
2015-01-24 17:41:06	Yoshi2_	"stop synching" doesn't even imply "delete the folder", so it only confuses the user
2015-01-24 17:41:44	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-24 17:42:37	Yoshi2_	I also think it has lead to me losing quite a few files because I wanted to move some stuff from dropbox to my local device
2015-01-24 17:43:30	Yoshi2_	after I stopped synching some folders, I went on to remove them from dropbox forever
2015-01-24 17:43:43	Yoshi2_	and you can guess what happened next
2015-01-24 17:43:47	@Espyo	yeah...

2015-01-24 17:50:58	Yoshi2_	this game is suprisingly complicated

2015-01-24 17:53:56	Yoshi2_	yeah
2015-01-24 17:54:11	Yoshi2_	you are basically implementing a software that manages elevators
2015-01-24 17:55:06	Prezintenden	i wrote a program once that calculated a cross sum
2015-01-24 17:55:29	Prezintenden	i think that was about it. everything after that i needed for classes i stole off the internet
2015-01-24 17:57:58	Yoshi2_	were your tasks so simple that they could be googled?
2015-01-24 18:00:47	Prezintenden	yes
2015-01-24 18:01:37	Prezintenden	maybe not the last few, i had enough points by then
2015-01-24 18:02:18	Prezintenden	i can't shake the feeling i dont quite fit in here
2015-01-24 18:04:28	Yoshi2_	in our exams we have to write code on paper
2015-01-24 18:06:32	Prezintenden	well it was the first semester and a rather straightforward course that non-it students could take as well for credits. it wasnt all that advanced

2015-01-24 18:09:20	Prezintenden	and i acutally looks like agame i would play. huh
2015-01-24 18:09:22	@Espyo	thanks visual studio
2015-01-24 18:09:30	@Espyo	meanwhile, at work, I can get a clean compile in a minute
2015-01-24 18:09:35	@Espyo	well, at work, it's an eight-core machine
2015-01-24 18:09:38	@Espyo	a four-core here

2015-01-24 18:57:13	Yoshi2	while I'm still studying, I definitely don't need it

2015-01-24 18:57:40	Yoshi2	the traffic around the university is pretty much havoc in the morning and evening

2015-01-24 19:02:03	@PikFan	back
2015-01-24 19:04:52	@PikFan	ooh, so who's heard of Microsoft HoloLens?
2015-01-24 19:05:12	@Espyo	some weird thing
2015-01-24 19:05:15	@Espyo	don't know much about it
2015-01-24 19:06:03	@PikFan	it's a headset being developed by Microsoft to be released sometime during Windows 10's lifetime
2015-01-24 19:06:27	@Espyo	like the Occulus Rift, is it?
2015-01-24 19:06:40	@PikFan	the visor will create images that appear to blend in with the physical world, giving the impression of holograms
2015-01-24 19:06:47	@PikFan	kind of, yes
2015-01-24 19:07:05	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-01-24 19:07:17	@PikFan	but the Oculus Rift is virtual reality, whereas HoloLens is augmented reality
2015-01-24 19:07:22	@Espyo	right
2015-01-24 19:07:49	@Espyo	it'll probably be as epic as the Kinect
2015-01-24 19:07:51	@Espyo	meaning not at all
2015-01-24 19:07:55	@PikFan	anyway, HoloLens is controlled by voice commands, gestures, and gaze
2015-01-24 19:08:14	@PikFan	yeah, people are worried about that
2015-01-24 19:08:33	@PikFan	they think it'll be a flop
2015-01-24 19:09:40	@PikFan	it's a very interesting idea
2015-01-24 19:10:58	@PikFan	when it was unveiled, it was demonstrated, too
2015-01-24 19:11:08	Yoshi2	I'm fine with whichever technology brings me the least amount of advertising in my face
2015-01-24 19:11:37	@PikFan	this person created a quadcopter using one of its apps, then 3D printed it
2015-01-24 19:11:54	@PikFan	they even made it fly
2015-01-24 19:12:52	Yoshi2	I don't think you can 3D print a functional quadcopter
2015-01-24 19:13:03	Yoshi2	but you could 3D print the parts and then assemble it
2015-01-24 19:13:55	@PikFan	prior to the demo they 3D printed it
2015-01-24 19:14:12	@PikFan	then they probably added some wires and whatnot
2015-01-24 19:21:24	@Espyo	ugh... here come the multithreading headaches
2015-01-24 19:21:33	@Espyo	I want the engine to show a loading screen, while loading stuff in another thread
2015-01-24 19:21:45	@Espyo	except a "window" can only "belong" to one thread at a time
2015-01-24 19:21:55	@Espyo	so I can't draw the loading screen on the window at the same time I load bitmaps
2015-01-24 19:22:03	@Espyo	this is because the bitmaps need to be tied to a "window"
2015-01-24 19:22:36	@Espyo	I've tried convoluted things, but nothing really worked
2015-01-24 19:22:40	@Espyo	I hope the Allegro forums can help...

2015-01-24 19:44:15	@Espyo	well that was fast
2015-01-24 19:44:32	@Espyo	someone said I had to convert the memory bitmaps into video bitmaps after the loading is done
2015-01-24 19:44:34	@Espyo	which sucks
2015-01-24 19:44:50	@Espyo	it's probably slow
2015-01-24 19:56:23	Yoshi2	what is the difference between memory and video bitmaps?
2015-01-24 19:56:25	@J	alternatively, just do it in one thread and update the screen between each operation
2015-01-24 19:56:32	@J	people won't even notice
2015-01-24 19:57:06	@J	not sure what interfaces Allegro provides for loading stuff, but you should only need 1 thread since it's IO-bound anyway
2015-01-24 19:57:17	@J	just select() after each frame
2015-01-24 19:58:02	@J	Yoshi2: video ones will just be stored in the memory owned by the GPU
2015-01-24 19:58:17	@J	which is where they need to be to draw them

2015-01-24 20:04:07	@Espyo	yeah, but no doubt it'd be harder to implement
2015-01-24 20:10:03	@J	I would say the first way would be easier than multi-threaded
2015-01-24 20:10:10	@J	just load one file between each frame
2015-01-24 20:10:15	@J	potentially worse, though
2015-01-24 20:10:23	@J	the second way is the ideal way, and yeah, harder
2015-01-24 20:12:53	@Espyo	I'd have to atomize the loading procedure to hell and back
2015-01-24 20:13:02	@Espyo	an image can take milliseconds to load, or seconds
2015-01-24 20:13:13	@Espyo	well, I don't think I have any second-long image loading
2015-01-24 20:13:17	@Espyo	but still, more than a frame, for sure
2015-01-24 20:13:26	@Espyo	plus I'd have to do something of the sort for text files, sound files, etc.
2015-01-24 20:13:35	@Espyo	threads aren't complicated per se
2015-01-24 20:13:40	@Espyo	it's their darn niches that are
2015-01-24 20:17:26	@J	but what are you showing on your loading screen?
2015-01-24 20:17:31	@J	does it have to run at 60FPS?
2015-01-24 20:18:04	@J	it would be faster too, avoiding the copy to video memory later
2015-01-24 20:21:29	@Espyo	I was thinking of keeping track of the loading progress
2015-01-24 20:21:38	@Espyo	that doesn't stop anything
2015-01-24 20:21:42	@Espyo	never mind that
2015-01-24 20:21:53	@J	yeah, loading bars don't have to be super-smooth
2015-01-24 20:21:55	@Espyo	anyway, like in the Pikmin games, just the name of the area, and some weird effect with the name, under it
2015-01-24 20:22:38	@Espyo	but either way, if I do it single-thread, I'll have to have some harness to everything I load
2015-01-24 20:22:41	@Espyo	like a loadable_item class
2015-01-24 20:22:57	@Espyo	and then somewhere have a way to have a full list of the things I will load, before I load them
2015-01-24 20:23:04	@J	although TBH, I expect your loading times will be tiny
2015-01-24 20:23:05	@Espyo	and find a way to store them, instead of being loose wherever
2015-01-24 20:23:09	@Espyo	pfft
2015-01-24 20:23:11	@Espyo	they're already not-tiny
2015-01-24 20:23:14	@J	how
2015-01-24 20:23:28	@Espyo	I WANTED to make them faster by parallelizing, but at this rate, it's not happening, with all these shenanigans
2015-01-24 20:23:34	@Espyo	Allegro is pretty slow at loading bitmaps and sounds
2015-01-24 20:23:52	@J	meh, IO will be the bottleneck anyway, so parallelisation is pointless
2015-01-24 20:24:14	@Espyo	you can try any version you have lying around, it'll probably take over 5 seconds to load
2015-01-24 20:24:16	@Espyo	hmm, right
2015-01-24 20:24:22	@J	really?
2015-01-24 20:24:27	@Espyo	it has to
2015-01-24 20:24:30	@Espyo	it's so at work, too
2015-01-24 20:24:35	@J	I'll try
2015-01-24 20:24:38	@Espyo	I'm not sure if my machine at work's better than yours, but
2015-01-24 20:24:47	@Espyo	well, loading is more than just fetching stuff from disk
2015-01-24 20:24:50	@Espyo	I parse some of my files
2015-01-24 20:25:00	@Espyo	and generating the area is a massive task, with only a tiny bit being disk loading
2015-01-24 20:25:05	@Espyo	so there's still room for parallelization yet
2015-01-24 20:25:20	@J	doesn't help that GitHub is giving me 30KiB/s
2015-01-24 20:25:24	@Espyo	I already wrote classes and functions to handle parallelization, so now it's only a matter of the user having multi-core
2015-01-24 20:25:28	@Espyo	and the code actually working
2015-01-24 20:25:41	@Espyo	hm, weird
2015-01-24 20:26:57	@J	I can't really see any of that stuff being CPU-bound, but hey, if it works
2015-01-24 20:28:58	@J	so close to compiling
2015-01-24 20:29:08	@J	missing make_pair in functions.h

2015-01-24 20:30:43	@Espyo	add std:: before make_pair
2015-01-24 20:30:59	@Espyo	strange, I pulled and compiled at work around a week ago
2015-01-24 20:31:01	@Espyo	it was fine
2015-01-24 20:31:16	@J	http://sprunge.us/PVbC
2015-01-24 20:32:11	@Espyo	this again?!
2015-01-24 20:32:14	@Espyo	ugh, I already fixed it
2015-01-24 20:32:17	@Espyo	can't remember how
2015-01-24 20:32:20	@Espyo	let's see how my code is
2015-01-24 20:33:28	@Espyo	oh, I remember
2015-01-24 20:33:50	@Espyo	s/make_pair<size_t, string>\(/make_pair\(
2015-01-24 20:34:11	@J	...sure
2015-01-24 20:34:29	@J	first run, so it's going to be cold, < 1s
2015-01-24 20:35:01	@J	anything I can do to make it slower?
2015-01-24 20:35:42	@Espyo	not... really
2015-01-24 20:36:07	@Espyo	wait, did you measure the first run yet or not?
2015-01-24 20:36:12	@Espyo	because your message is lost in time
2015-01-24 20:36:42	@J	what?
2015-01-24 20:36:46	@J	[20:34:29] @J first run, so it's going to be cold, < 1s
2015-01-24 20:38:03	@Espyo	you already know that it's going to be < 1s?
2015-01-24 20:38:16	@J	I did it
2015-01-24 20:38:25	@J	that was the result
2015-01-24 20:38:26	@Espyo	so it isn't "it's going to be", but "it was"
2015-01-24 20:38:33	@J	uh, hmm
2015-01-24 20:38:40	@J	that's not really the future tense
2015-01-24 20:38:52	@Espyo	hmmmmmm... okay
2015-01-24 20:38:52	@J	not sure what it's technically called
2015-01-24 20:38:56	@Espyo	anyway, your computer can't be real
2015-01-24 20:39:31	@Espyo	the time from start to the actual area, leaders, etc. appearing, right?
2015-01-24 20:40:46	@J	wait, if I drop all disk cache then try again, it's about 5 seconds
2015-01-24 20:40:58	@J	but doing that also makes Vim take about 3 seconds to load, so...
2015-01-24 20:41:09	@J	it's unloading all the shared libraries that _everything_ uses
2015-01-24 20:41:17	@J	windowing, drawing, all of that
2015-01-24 20:42:04	@J	it even makes 'ls' take 1.5s
2015-01-24 20:43:07	@Espyo	hm
2015-01-24 20:43:12	@Espyo	woah, crazy
2015-01-24 20:43:30	@J	with a warm run, actually using 'time', I can run it, see the in-game cursor spinning, then close it within 0.8s
2015-01-24 20:43:40	@Espyo	I mean, not like loading time should be the #1 concern, but...
2015-01-24 20:43:48	@Espyo	let me try here, warm
2015-01-24 20:43:50	@J	correction, 0.6
2015-01-24 20:44:01	@Espyo	uh, I have changes made to the code
2015-01-24 20:44:04	@Espyo	and no older version
2015-01-24 20:44:06	@J	if I take out reaction time by anticipating the load time
2015-01-24 20:44:07	@Espyo	scratch that
2015-01-24 20:44:17	@Espyo	well, warm boot takes about a second
2015-01-24 20:44:23	@Espyo	...I don't know, then
2015-01-24 20:44:29	@Espyo	might be debug vs release build
2015-01-24 20:44:42	@J	TBH, I've never seen Windows even create a window in less than a second, so...
2015-01-24 20:44:47	@Espyo	true
2015-01-24 20:45:01	@Espyo	anyway, I'll still need a loading screen of sorts, that's for sure
2015-01-24 20:45:10	@Espyo	there's this thing I thought I could do
2015-01-24 20:45:23	@Espyo	keep the window as the "current" bitmap for the loader thread
2015-01-24 20:45:34	@Espyo	and when I need to refresh the screen, temporarily take control
2015-01-24 20:45:36	@Espyo	but it didn't work
2015-01-24 20:45:45	@Espyo	the guy on the forum thread did say it wasn't meant to
2015-01-24 20:45:50	@Espyo	can't really understand why, but *shrug*
2015-01-24 20:46:01	@Espyo	anyway, I'll try loading all as memory bitmaps, then converting
2015-01-24 20:46:09	@Espyo	except I'll have to keep a list of pointers of pointers to bitmaps
2015-01-24 20:46:13	@Espyo	ugh... incoming headaches
2015-01-24 20:46:29	@J	anyway, you still have that really annoying problem where you have to release a direction key before starting moving in the other direction
2015-01-24 20:46:39	@J	since you stop moving whenever you release a direction key
2015-01-24 20:47:03	@Espyo	fixed in my code already
2015-01-24 20:47:08	@J	great
2015-01-24 20:47:16	@Espyo	I mustn't've committed it
2015-01-24 20:47:22	@Espyo	it was really easy, and this works for everything
2015-01-24 20:47:26	@Espyo	even the C-stick group moving
2015-01-24 20:48:18	Yoshi2	"mustn't've"
2015-01-24 20:48:39	Yoshi2	that was a bit painful to read
2015-01-24 20:48:49	@J	yeah, it's really easy
2015-01-24 20:48:53	@Espyo	love typing it
2015-01-24 20:49:20	@J	the only thing is you need to store the state for each button, not just a number which is 'positive - negative' or something
2015-01-24 20:49:29	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-24 20:49:34	@J	...and I should really eat
2015-01-24 20:49:42	@Espyo	probably should
2015-01-24 20:49:47	Yoshi2	I don't think "mustn't" is the word you are looking for, because "I mustn't do something" means something like "I am not allowed to do something"
2015-01-24 20:50:08	@Espyo	I must not have committed it
2015-01-24 20:50:12	@J	it does work
2015-01-24 20:50:13	@Espyo	just means I probably didn't
2015-01-24 20:50:19	@Espyo	doesn't necessarily mean "I can't have"
2015-01-24 20:50:26	@J	'must' has a few subtly different meanings, really
2015-01-24 20:50:29	@Espyo	yeah
2015-01-24 20:50:33	@Espyo	...come to think of it...
2015-01-24 20:50:40	@Espyo	can = possibility
2015-01-24 20:50:43	@Espyo	can't = impossibility
2015-01-24 20:50:49	@Espyo	must = mandatory
2015-01-24 20:50:58	@Espyo	must not = not mandatory
2015-01-24 20:51:11	@Espyo	wait, that didn't come out with the point I wanted
2015-01-24 20:51:14	Yoshi2	mandatory to not do something
2015-01-24 20:51:16	@J	...
2015-01-24 20:51:27	@Espyo	can = not mandatory yes
2015-01-24 20:51:32	@Espyo	can't = mandatory no
2015-01-24 20:51:35	@Espyo	must = mandatory yes
2015-01-24 20:51:41	@Espyo	mustn't = not mandatory no
2015-01-24 20:51:59	@Espyo	if... mustn't is used in the context I used above
2015-01-24 20:52:00	@Espyo	eesh, words
2015-01-24 20:52:32	@J	but 'I can't have committed it' - same thing
2015-01-24 20:52:47	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-01-24 20:53:17	Yoshi2	"I probably haven't comitted it yet"
2015-01-24 20:56:15	Yoshi2	it can be confusing in German because one could easily think "muss" -> "must", and "muss nicht" -> "must not"
2015-01-24 20:57:18	Yoshi2	but "musst nicht" means something like "don't have to do something", while "must not" means "not allowed to do something"
2015-01-24 20:57:45	@Espyo	what a mess
2015-01-24 20:58:29	Yoshi2	in school I saw the term "false friends" in connection with such words
2015-01-24 20:59:24	Yoshi2	another word is "bekommen", which you could accidently translate with "become" because they sound similar
2015-01-24 21:00:45	Yoshi2	though "bekommen" means something like "get/receive something"
2015-01-24 21:00:46	@Espyo	hehe
2015-01-24 21:00:50	@Espyo	yeah, false friends is what they are

This random message came from the messages but anyway, yeah, there was a nasty netsplit and http://lohas.nicoseiga.jp/thumb/2369712i there is so much wrong in this image.

2015-01-25 12:45:59	Yoshi2	there is definitely quite a bit wrong with that picture, but it could've been worse

2015-01-25 14:34:24	Shard1	So, did you hear about Club Nintendo being discontinued?
2015-01-25 14:35:38	Yoshi2	yup
2015-01-25 14:35:57	Yoshi2	no idea what I am going to do with all those codes I've collected so far
2015-01-25 14:36:26	Shard1	Yeah, until they put up something GOOD. 
2015-01-25 14:37:10	Yoshi2	I'll probably just give them away 
2015-01-25 14:38:09	@Espyo	hey

2015-01-25 14:43:52	@Espyo	it does for me

2015-01-25 14:47:25	Shard1	That's what I'm thinking.
2015-01-25 14:50:05	Yoshi2	does mibbit support phones?
2015-01-25 14:50:20	Shard1	I have no idea.
2015-01-25 14:50:26	@Espyo	I think it does
2015-01-25 14:52:00	Shard1	Yup it does
2015-01-25 14:54:24	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'm also quite suprised how you knew what that person was talking about
2015-01-25 14:54:49	@Espyo	well, there's only one featured image

2015-01-25 14:57:28	Yoshi2	oh
2015-01-25 14:57:31	Yoshi2	right
2015-01-25 14:58:02	Yoshi2	the featured article is the one on the front page of the wiki
2015-01-25 14:58:02	Shard1	Does anybody else have the Pikmin 3 DLC?
2015-01-25 14:58:08	Yoshi2	nope
2015-01-25 14:58:20	@Espyo	not yet I don't
2015-01-25 14:58:51	Shard1	I think that Nintendo should make the remakes of Pikmin 1 and 2 for virtual console

2015-01-25 14:59:16	Yoshi2	what bothers me more about the featured article is that it doesn't include the title of the article
2015-01-25 14:59:26	@Espyo	hm, good ideas
2015-01-25 14:59:29	@Espyo	*good idea
2015-01-25 14:59:44	Shard1	Well, I REALLY want to play those games
2015-01-25 15:00:17	@Espyo	you can always play either the GameCube games or the Wii ones
2015-01-25 15:00:37	Shard1	Which are extremely hard to get these days.
2015-01-25 15:01:16	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-01-25 15:01:34	Yoshi2	I lost my gamecube's memory card 
2015-01-25 15:01:50	Shard1	It's not that I don't want to buy them, but I'm not willing to pay $60 for Pikmin 2
2015-01-25 15:01:50	Testyo	$ 60 = 44.232 € / £ 37.83 
2015-01-25 15:02:02	Shard1	Well, that was handy.
2015-01-25 15:03:27	@Espyo	why do I even bother trying to use correct CSS to center text
2015-01-25 15:03:28	@Espyo	WHY
2015-01-25 15:03:36	@Espyo	I'm always like "I should use CSS instead of <center>"
2015-01-25 15:03:40	@Espyo	but in the end I ALWAYS use center
2015-01-25 15:03:42	@Espyo	because nothing EVER works
2015-01-25 15:03:54	Shard1	?
2015-01-25 15:04:06	@Espyo	web page style shenanigans
2015-01-25 15:04:15	@Espyo	I'm gonna add the title of the featured article to the featured article box

2015-01-25 15:06:42	Mns2002	Just to tell you,it's not a big deal (probuly because Im using a mobile device) the NIWA logo is replaced by a pikmin adventure logo

2015-01-25 15:06:45	@Espyo	just the text with the title of the article

2015-01-25 15:08:40	@Espyo	well, didn't try h3, but tried span

2015-01-25 15:15:09	@Espyo	we can and probably will use the game files, though

2015-01-25 15:16:58	Shard1	There: https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/zlCfzSuMZNMRHn5jPj 
2015-01-25 15:17:26	@Espyo	there's also the thing about the voyage logs in the European version being different from the American version

2015-01-25 15:17:34	@Espyo	it's just a mess, we'll all clean that up later with the files
2015-01-25 15:17:38	Shard1	Yeah, that's a lot of work
2015-01-25 15:18:03	Yoshi2	and each language in the European version has different logs
2015-01-25 15:18:19	Shard1	OH GOSH, that IS a lot
2015-01-25 15:18:24	@Espyo	mhm...
2015-01-25 15:19:58	Shard1	For some reason, I think that it would be cool in Pikmin 4 if something hit the ship while you were in space and you had to go through a skydiving sequence in order to get down to PNF-404
2015-01-25 15:21:14	@Espyo	lol
2015-01-25 15:21:17	@Espyo	like Skyward Sword?
2015-01-25 15:23:04	Shard1	except BETTER, because the skyward sword skydiving was very limited. Something more like the ones in Lego City: Undercover
2015-01-25 15:33:04	Yoshi2	I think it would become rather boring if it happened too often

2015-01-28 19:41:40	UltraMario	i thought you meant the other kind

2015-01-28 19:44:36	@Espyo	the Citrus Lump fruit infobox should say "(fruit)"
2015-01-28 19:44:40	@Espyo	but for some reason it just doesn't
2015-01-28 19:48:55	Yoshi2	Espyo: somehow not many people are fond of it
2015-01-28 19:49:12	Yoshi2	Prolog, I mean
2015-01-28 19:49:40	@Espyo	probably because they face Prolog like any other programming language
2015-01-28 19:49:41	@Espyo	but it isn't
2015-01-28 19:50:14	Yoshi2	yeah, it is rather special in that aspect

2015-01-28 19:53:30	@Espyo	ok, can anybody explain this mistake of nature? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:Contributions/173.79.104.123
2015-01-28 19:53:39	@Espyo	half of his contributions are good, even if butchered
2015-01-28 19:53:42	@Espyo	the other half are vandalism
2015-01-28 19:53:44	@Espyo	I don't even
2015-01-28 19:54:21	Yoshi2	if you define the relationship between two things, you can specify one thing and receive all possible values for the other thing that fit the relationship
2015-01-28 19:55:05	Yoshi2	"She is tied with vines and a leaf over her mouth and completely stripped of her space suit."
2015-01-28 19:55:12	Yoshi2	I do not remember that part in Pikmin 3

2015-01-28 19:57:18	Yoshi2	it sounds like the introduction to a story that is definitely not safe for everyone
2015-01-28 19:58:41	@Espyo	but ALL too common on the internet
2015-01-28 20:02:26	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-01-28 20:02:43	Yoshi2	but less common on wikis that contain facts about the games

2015-01-28 20:22:25	Yoshi2	that's several meals per meal
2015-01-28 20:22:44	UltraMario	anyone wanna see some SSB themed sprite recolors I made? :D
2015-01-28 20:23:17	Yoshi2	what sprites did you recolor?
2015-01-28 20:23:44	UltraMario	lucas's mother 3 sprites and ness's earthbound sprites so far
2015-01-28 20:24:03	UltraMario	 http://smashboards.com/threads/ultramarios-mostly-smash-bros-themed-sprite-recolor-gallery.388700/
2015-01-28 20:24:14	UltraMario	the recolors are based off the alts in smash bros.
2015-01-28 20:25:44	UltraMario	how'd I do? :o
2015-01-28 20:25:44	Testyo	UltraMario is a flooder!
2015-01-28 20:25:51	UltraMario	hey. ;_;

2015-01-28 20:26:08	Yoshi2	how does it happen that you manage to recolor the sprites, but are too lazy to crop the picture to only show the related sprites? :>
2015-01-28 20:26:14	@Espyo	the canon color swaps needed more references
2015-01-28 20:26:27	@Espyo	a Lucas-themed and a Ninten-themed color palette for Ness would be pretty nice
2015-01-28 20:26:32	UltraMario	agreed
2015-01-28 20:26:41	@Espyo	at least it makes the fans of those characters connect more, even if the characters themselves aren't there
2015-01-28 20:26:48	@Espyo	but come now, we can't expect Sakurai to do that
2015-01-28 20:26:50	@Espyo	because he's a nutjob
2015-01-28 20:26:51	Testyo	Espyo is flooding!

2015-01-28 20:28:03	Yoshi2	I'm currently overlaying two of the pictures just so I know which sprites you changed
2015-01-28 20:28:12	UltraMario	ok
2015-01-28 20:28:30	UltraMario	I only changed Ness's sprites and Lucas's sprites
2015-01-28 20:28:40	UltraMario	but I did 3 recolors for Ness and only 1 for Lucas
2015-01-28 20:29:05	UltraMario	because it took so long just to do Claus and I didn't want to spend all the time on all of his other recolors. :p
2015-01-28 20:29:19	UltraMario	i only did the 3 basic recolors for ness that appeared in each game
2015-01-28 20:31:48	Yoshi2	some of the other sprites, like the car and some of the monsters, also change appearance in each of the character sheet
2015-01-28 20:40:19	UltraMario	oh
2015-01-28 20:40:32	UltraMario	well that's just because again, I was too lazy to get rid of all the unrelated stuff

2015-01-28 20:50:18	Yoshi2	I assume the sprites at the bottom being recoloured is an unlucky (or lucky) side effect of changing the colour of all pixels that have a specific colour

2015-01-28 22:24:42	@Espyo	so on the forums we discussed some more the loading screen video bitmap shenanigans
2015-01-28 22:25:10	@Espyo	loading stuff on the loading thread makes it a memory bitmap (because the window "belongs" to the main thread, the one that draws the loading animation)
2015-01-28 22:25:18	@Espyo	but turns out that's no problem, because I can just convert later, and it's simple
2015-01-28 22:25:32	@Espyo	...except during the loading, I also create my own bitmaps, the area image buffers
2015-01-28 22:25:36	@Espyo	and those bitmaps get textures drawn on them
2015-01-28 22:25:41	@Espyo	and it's just memory-on-memory action
2015-01-28 22:25:48	@Espyo	which sucks, because video-on-video is better
2015-01-28 22:25:53	@Espyo	so... in short...
2015-01-28 22:25:58	@Espyo	there's no way to do this that won't involve stupid code
2015-01-28 22:26:17	@Espyo	like loading stuff between frames (hello inconsistent framerate)

2015-01-28 23:17:34	@Espyo	oh no
2015-01-28 23:17:41	@Espyo	I just realized that because some images are sprite-sheets
2015-01-28 23:17:50	@Espyo	and the graphics I use in-game are sub-bitmaps of those sprite-sheets
2015-01-28 23:18:09	@Espyo	when I convert the memory bitmap sprite-sheets to video, I'll have to recreate them, because that's currently the only way

2015-01-29 19:41:25	Yoshi2	well, I should have the new version of my bms converter running soon
2015-01-29 19:42:30	Yoshi2	for the most part, it will only play notes and make pauses, nothing else, because I still need to test if the way I rewrote the program is actually a good way

2015-01-30 19:29:46	@Espyo	got a little something to discuss with you, so don't go too far

2015-01-30 19:40:24	@Espyo	heh
2015-01-30 19:40:25	@Espyo	don't worry
2015-01-30 19:40:26	@Espyo	it's not nasty
2015-01-30 19:48:47	@Espyo	okay, so
2015-01-30 19:49:21	@Espyo	one or two months ago I made a JS script that would read the wikitext of a page while editing, and report policy violations, under-optimized stuff, and stupid wikia crap
2015-01-30 19:49:24	@Espyo	I think I might've already said
2015-01-30 19:49:27	@Espyo	anyway, today I was thinking
2015-01-30 19:49:37	@Espyo	we CAN have custom JS on the wiki
2015-01-30 19:49:45	@Espyo	and this thing IS just one tiny button atop the editing window
2015-01-30 19:50:02	@Espyo	and it WILL help people follow through with the policies without having to memorize them, plus all the other optimizations
2015-01-30 19:50:04	@Espyo	so...
2015-01-30 19:50:25	@Espyo	at what point would it be a bad idea to implement that on the wiki?
2015-01-30 19:51:21	Yoshi2_	how can it do optimizations?
2015-01-30 19:51:47	@Espyo	it actually doesn't DO anything to the text, it just warns
2015-01-30 19:53:02	@Espyo	but it can go from warning about <span>s that don't do anything (believe me, at least one in every two pages from wiki have one of those)
2015-01-30 19:53:19	@Espyo	to warning about trailing spaces (also loads, I for the life of me can't understand what the hell is up with that)
2015-01-30 19:57:03	@J	probably only want to highlight changes by the editor
2015-01-30 19:57:14	@J	otherwise you start editing a page, and suddenly it tells you to fix everything
2015-01-30 19:57:23	@J	seems like it could put people off
2015-01-30 19:57:29	@Espyo	right, I thought about that, too
2015-01-30 19:57:36	@Espyo	for me, I'm fine having it warn about everything
2015-01-30 19:57:40	@Espyo	but for the others...
2015-01-30 19:57:47	@Espyo	now, thing is, how can I know exactly what it is the editor changed?
2015-01-30 19:57:51	@J	yeah...
2015-01-30 19:57:56	@Espyo	either way, it's optional
2015-01-30 19:58:03	@Espyo	it lets you save and preview without interference
2015-01-30 19:58:05	@J	opt-in or opt-out?
2015-01-30 19:58:06	@Espyo	it's just a button on the corner
2015-01-30 19:58:08	@J	oh
2015-01-30 19:58:10	@J	wait
2015-01-30 19:58:14	@J	you press the button to show it?
2015-01-30 19:58:18	@Espyo	a button to start the analysis
2015-01-30 19:58:24	@J	mm,  fair enough then
2015-01-30 19:58:42	@Espyo	only the people who want to help with the fine details would use anything like that, anyway
2015-01-30 19:58:43	@J	could be useful
2015-01-30 19:58:58	@Espyo	so if they want to help with the fine details, they can probably help the page as a whole
2015-01-30 19:59:08	@Espyo	it'd be nice for it to monitor every change, but
2015-01-30 19:59:12	@Espyo	it'd probably just be intrusive
2015-01-30 19:59:22	@Espyo	plus us having no idea how to detect editor changes
2015-01-30 19:59:41	@Espyo	but for the people who think they're up for the task, it's right there to help them
2015-01-30 20:00:41	@Espyo	I'll clean it up one of these days and send it your way so you can give feedback
2015-01-30 20:01:16	@J	sure
2015-01-30 20:02:45	Yoshi2_	a button that does the analysis seems like a good idea
2015-01-30 20:03:44	@Espyo	plus it probably wouldn't really work that well to help the people who do minor edits
2015-01-30 20:03:52	@Espyo	you can KIND of split the editors into three groups
2015-01-30 20:03:53	@Espyo	the pros
2015-01-30 20:04:05	@Espyo	the ones that do misc. edits and know the basic workarounds of the wiki
2015-01-30 20:04:12	@Espyo	and the ones that stop by sometimes to fix a typo or add a line
2015-01-30 20:04:35	@Espyo	the latter don't really need the analyzer, even though they'll probably screw up somewhere
2015-01-30 20:04:38	@Espyo	but hey, it's only one line

2015-01-30 23:37:43	@J	I'm really confused right now
2015-01-30 23:39:11	@J	so I have a thread to run some stuff in, and it sends data to the UI thread using Qt signals
2015-01-30 23:39:32	@J	just a signal.emit(data) kind of thing that works across threads
2015-01-30 23:39:56	@J	I write the data to a textarea
2015-01-30 23:40:26	@J	the worker thread is iterating over a list to get the data, and batches results up before sending them
2015-01-30 23:40:59	@J	now, I made the data that gets sent to the UI thread fixed - ie. it still does the calculations, but always sends a hardcoded result
2015-01-30 23:41:26	@J	what happens is, somehow the UI responsiveness depends on one of my inputs to the calculation
2015-01-30 23:41:50	@J	specifically, it's slow if my output template (this is for my file renamer) starts with '/'
2015-01-30 23:42:12	@J	even crazier, if I insert a 1ms sleep for each iteration on the worker thread, the UI gets more responsive
2015-01-30 23:42:50	@J	you would think that means it's flooding the UI with too much data, right?
2015-01-30 23:43:16	@J	but then why would the input to the calculation affect it, when the data is independent of the input
2015-01-30 23:44:26	@J	OH
2015-01-30 23:44:28	@J	I worked it out
2015-01-30 23:44:47	@J	it's because, for some reason, if the template starts with / the calculation is about 3 times faster
2015-01-30 23:44:52	@J	so in that case it's flooding the UI
2015-01-30 23:44:56	@J	thanks for the help
2015-01-30 23:48:39	@Espyo	<J> so I have a thread to run some stuff in, and it sends data to the UI thread using Qt signals
2015-01-30 23:48:40	@Espyo	oh no
2015-01-30 23:48:46	@Espyo	I rubbed threading off on GP
2015-01-30 23:49:52	@Espyo	is it MEANT to be slow if it starts with /?
2015-01-30 23:56:27	@J	I said the actual calculation is faster (somehow)
2015-01-30 23:56:54	@J	probably because it removes the need for the absolute path lookup
2015-01-30 23:57:29	@J	so it seems like what slows down the UI isn't writing the data to the textarea, it's sending signals too quickly
2015-01-30 23:57:42	@J	so instead of batches of fixed size, I should batch by time

2015-01-31 12:26:30	@J	threading is working fairly well now
2015-01-31 12:33:25	@Espyo	yeah, when it works well, it works well
2015-01-31 12:33:29	@Espyo	when it works badly, it REALLY works badly
2015-01-31 12:38:50	Yoshi2	when it goes wrong, it goes wrong in the most horrible way you can imagine
2015-01-31 12:39:15	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-31 12:41:39	Yoshi2	there is something I noticed in Wind Waker in one of my first playthroughs of the Wii U version
2015-01-31 12:41:46	Yoshi2	and I finally managed to make a screenshot of that
2015-01-31 12:42:34	Yoshi2	you know how there is a map of the tower of gods that also contains a triangle island with all three godesses?
2015-01-31 12:46:29	@Espyo	with all three?
2015-01-31 12:46:46	@Espyo	I know there's a glitch where all three appear smushed together
2015-01-31 12:47:45	Yoshi2	I think when one statue is shown in the cutscene, the other two are disabled
2015-01-31 12:48:12	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-01-31 12:48:18	@Espyo	that makes a lot of sense, actually
2015-01-31 12:48:58	Yoshi2	anyway, I'm pretty sure this is the island: http://i.imgur.com/Avn63Ze.jpg
2015-01-31 12:51:54	@Espyo	let me re-read Zelda Wiki on this
2015-01-31 12:52:15	Yoshi2	another view from earlier in the cutscene: http://i.imgur.com/KGWN2B9.jpg
2015-01-31 12:53:25	@Espyo	ah, yes
2015-01-31 12:53:29	Yoshi2	note: the triangle islands are usually MUCH farther away
2015-01-31 12:53:34	@Espyo	but I thought that —
2015-01-31 12:53:36	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2015-01-31 12:53:48	@Espyo	and nobody really noticed this yet?
2015-01-31 12:54:55	Yoshi2	no idea, haven't seen much about that
2015-01-31 12:56:02	@Espyo	great, now the internet forgot about that glitch
2015-01-31 12:56:10	@Espyo	I tried googling, tried Zelda Wiki, nothing mentions that glitch any more
2015-01-31 12:56:17	Yoshi2	what glitch?
2015-01-31 12:56:18	@Espyo	I know Pikipedia does... or did
2015-01-31 12:56:30	@Espyo	the glitch where you can see up close the three statues mashed together

2015-01-31 12:57:20	Yoshi2	that video is linked on the tcrf page of WW about this particular triangle island

2015-01-31 12:58:21	Yoshi2	in the comments somebody mentioned noticing the triangle island in the cutscene too
2015-01-31 12:58:50	@Espyo	ah
2015-01-31 12:58:53	Yoshi2	I need to check a LP of the GC version about this particular part of the game

2015-01-31 12:59:36	Yoshi2	well, I might be the first to write about it on a wiki
2015-01-31 13:02:20	Yoshi2	my guess is that in the GC version the island would be hidden by the game's non-widescreen resolution

2015-01-31 13:13:10	@Espyo	there's one thing I don't get
2015-01-31 13:13:19	@Espyo	that island is used in the cutscene where the three statues connect, right?
2015-01-31 13:13:26	@Espyo	so they just hide the tower of the gods?
2015-01-31 13:13:29	@Espyo	wait, I do get that
2015-01-31 13:13:32	@Espyo	makes perfect sense
2015-01-31 13:13:34	@Espyo	wait, does it?
2015-01-31 13:13:41	@Espyo	what triggers the cutscene where the statues connect?
2015-01-31 13:13:45	@Espyo	it's when you deliver the final orb, right?
2015-01-31 13:14:00	@Espyo	so why pick the tower of the gods's quadrant for the cutscene?
2015-01-31 13:14:59	Yoshi2	because when you deliver the final orb, the cutscene starts and the tower of the gods rises above the water
2015-01-31 13:15:09	@Espyo	oooooohh

2015-01-31 13:18:28	Yoshi2	well, looks like my theory is wrong
2015-01-31 13:19:20	Yoshi2	the island could already be seen in the original version

2015-01-31 13:19:53	Shard1	Whixh island?
2015-01-31 13:20:01	Shard1	dang it, spelling errors
2015-01-31 13:20:39	Yoshi2	Wind Waker has a map of the Tower of Gods which contains a triangle island and the goddess statues
2015-01-31 13:21:19	Yoshi2	which can be seen in a cutscene after you meet Ganon for the first time
2015-01-31 13:21:35	Yoshi2	even though the triangle islands should be much farther away
2015-01-31 13:23:05	Shard1	oh yeah!
2015-01-31 13:25:02	Yoshi2	Shard1: look at how close it is to the ToG: https://i.imgur.com/Avn63Ze.jpg
2015-01-31 13:25:07	Yoshi2	barely a stone throw away
2015-01-31 13:25:53	Shard1	go figure
2015-01-31 13:27:07	Shard1	so, what games are you looking forward too?
2015-01-31 13:27:40	Yoshi2	mario maker
2015-01-31 13:30:58	Shard1	that game looks good I'm thinking about Splatoon
2015-01-31 13:34:52	Shard1	http://play.nintendo.com/activities/quizzes/which-pikmin-are-you-most/
2015-01-31 13:35:50	Shard1	I got blue
2015-01-31 13:35:51	Yoshi2	if it is as powerful as it looks in the videos, mario maker will easily become my GotY
2015-01-31 13:36:40	Yoshi2	the first question is unfair
2015-01-31 13:36:48	Yoshi2	I never pick up dogs
2015-01-31 13:37:25	Shard1	I know, right? I just guessed
2015-01-31 13:38:20	Yoshi2	winged pikmin
2015-01-31 13:38:28	Yoshi2	woohoo
2015-01-31 13:39:20	Yoshi2	but I think it was pretty much a give-away when I picked "Helicopter"
2015-01-31 13:41:33	Yoshi2	I went through the quiz 5 times and chose different objects for the "That's a sweet [insert here]!" question
2015-01-31 13:42:06	Shard1	And? What do you deduce?
2015-01-31 13:42:12	Yoshi2	I am 3/5th a purple pikmin, 1/5th a yellow pikmin and 1/5th a winged pikmin
2015-01-31 13:43:12	Yoshi2	I do like to reverse-engineer such quiz pages
2015-01-31 13:43:33	Shard1	Hmm, I'll try
2015-01-31 13:45:19	Shard1	I am 3/5th a purple pikmin, 1/5th a yellow pikmin, and 1/5th a blue pikmin
2015-01-31 13:45:29	Yoshi2	hm, I will try to reverse-engineer the answers later, got trouble with firefox's web dev tools
2015-01-31 13:46:39	Shard1	I'll see what other quizes I can reverse-engineer :}
2015-01-31 13:55:45	Shard1	well, I just hit the point where I'm going to need to take an in-game screenshot for my walkthrough
2015-01-31 14:01:34	@Espyo	>We're not just going to ask you your favorite color because, duh, OBVIOUS.
2015-01-31 14:01:48	@Espyo	"instead, we'll just ask questions about your strength, your liking of water, your nose size, etc."
2015-01-31 14:01:52	@Espyo	"you know, non-obvious questions"
2015-01-31 14:02:19	Shard1	:P True enough
2015-01-31 14:02:39	@Espyo	>how would your friend describe you?
2015-01-31 14:02:41	@Espyo	>flighty
2015-01-31 14:02:43	@Espyo	COME ON, NINTENDO
2015-01-31 14:03:59	Yoshi2	back stabber
2015-01-31 14:04:03	Yoshi2	very violent
2015-01-31 14:04:15	@Espyo	I picked that
2015-01-31 14:04:22	@Espyo	I... fail to see how a Yellow Pikmin fits
2015-01-31 14:04:23	Shard1	I know, and there is NO pikmin who is a back-stabber
2015-01-31 14:04:32	@Espyo	I'll try again, because I REALLY want to know which is the "back-stabber"
2015-01-31 14:04:35	@Espyo	...Bulbmin, maybe?
2015-01-31 14:04:42	@Espyo	except nah, Nintendo doesn't really acknowledge unpopular things
2015-01-31 14:05:06	Shard1	No, I think they just have all of them excluding bulbmin
2015-01-31 14:05:21	Yoshi2	I need firebug
2015-01-31 14:06:28	@Espyo	hm, you're suggesting you can use JS to find out what does what?
2015-01-31 14:06:29	Shard1	Ok, so apparently White Pikmin is the "back stabber" as they are toxic and everything
2015-01-31 14:06:42	@Espyo	eeesh, what a cruddy description
2015-01-31 14:06:50	Yoshi2	Espyo: well, look at JS to find out what does what
2015-01-31 14:07:18	@Espyo	right
2015-01-31 14:07:23	@Espyo	good luck, chances are it's minified
2015-01-31 14:07:50	Yoshi2	somehow the firefox tools feel slower than firebug
2015-01-31 14:07:53	Shard1	I mean, so far only 5 types have been found when going through different combos
2015-01-31 14:08:34	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> somehow the firefox tools feel slower than firebug
2015-01-31 14:08:37	@Espyo	EXACT opposite to me
2015-01-31 14:08:44	@Espyo	I had to get rid of Firebug due to how slow it was
2015-01-31 14:08:48	Yoshi2	odd
2015-01-31 14:09:01	@Espyo	okay, so I tried answering white, red, yellow, purple, blue
2015-01-31 14:09:02	Shard1	So, I found red pikmin. Let's see if rock pikmin is possible
2015-01-31 14:09:04	@Espyo	and I got white
2015-01-31 14:09:04	@Espyo	eh
2015-01-31 14:09:54	Shard1	ok, I got the rock pikmin
2015-01-31 14:14:20	Yoshi2	alright, the script assigns a value from 0 to 4 to an array for each question you answer
2015-01-31 14:15:13	Shard1	Yeah! Let's get down to the brass tacks
2015-01-31 14:16:18	@Espyo	figues
2015-01-31 14:16:21	@Espyo	*figures
2015-01-31 14:17:03	Yoshi2	I've had the firefox tool just freeze on me when I was clicking around, but firebug works fine
2015-01-31 14:17:08	Yoshi2	very odd
2015-01-31 14:17:48	Shard1	Well, I had a slightly bad day yesterday. My thumb-rest on one of my clarinets broke
2015-01-31 14:18:39	@Espyo	damn that really sucks
2015-01-31 14:18:47	Shard1	Yeah
2015-01-31 14:18:54	Shard1	Luckily it wasn't my wooden one
2015-01-31 14:20:55	Yoshi2	damnit, I almost found something that looked useful
2015-01-31 14:21:06	Yoshi2	but then I clicked somewhere and now I am not sure where it was
2015-01-31 14:21:52	Yoshi2	ah, found it again
2015-01-31 14:22:25	Yoshi2	I think it is some json data
2015-01-31 14:22:55	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-01-31 14:23:14	Yoshi2	need to pretty-print it
2015-01-31 14:23:16	Shard1	so, what did you guys find out?

2015-01-31 14:29:11	Shard1	What do you guys speculate will be in Pikmin 4?
2015-01-31 14:30:18	Yoshi2	there are red, blue, yellow, rock, winged, white and purple pikmin in the quiz
2015-01-31 14:31:10	Shard1	Yeah, I found that out
2015-01-31 14:32:30	Yoshi2	and each answer has a value between 57 and 63
2015-01-31 14:32:45	@Espyo	hehe
2015-01-31 14:32:52	Yoshi2	I suppose those refer to pikmin IDs
2015-01-31 14:33:06	@Espyo	why those values though?
2015-01-31 14:33:29	Yoshi2	because nintendo
2015-01-31 14:33:42	Yoshi2	who knows, but the pikmin do have an ID each
2015-01-31 14:34:00	@Espyo	right
2015-01-31 14:34:05	Yoshi2	I'll write a code which puts together the questions and pikmin
2015-01-31 14:34:06	Shard1	So, the number add up and then the pikmin ID in that range is the one you get
2015-01-31 14:34:32	Yoshi2	maybe the numbers are added together and then divided by 5
2015-01-31 14:34:40	Shard1	Hmm, interesting
2015-01-31 14:34:48	Yoshi2	or maybe the game chooses the pikmin with the most answers
2015-01-31 14:34:54	Yoshi2	haven't looked yet
2015-01-31 14:41:09	Yoshi2	well, it shouldn't matter how the page chooses which pikmin you are
2015-01-31 14:41:39	Yoshi2	it probably chooses by which ID appears the most often in your answer array
2015-01-31 14:42:12	Yoshi2	because every question has one pikmin ID it doesn't have any answers for
2015-01-31 14:43:20	Shard1	but if there are 7 possibilities and 5 answers..
2015-01-31 14:43:51	Yoshi2	ah yes
2015-01-31 14:43:55	Yoshi2	two pikmin IDs
2015-01-31 14:44:05	Shard1	that sounds better
2015-01-31 14:44:14	Yoshi2	which won't have any answer belonging to them in each question
2015-01-31 14:45:50	Shard1	I'll be back
2015-01-31 14:45:56	Shard1	I got to go and do some things

2015-01-31 14:54:49	@Espyo	it already starts off dumb
2015-01-31 14:54:53	@Espyo	White Pikmin carry stuff fast
2015-01-31 14:55:05	@Espyo	sure, it could be all in the legs, but they still need to be at least as strong as other types
2015-01-31 14:55:11	@Espyo	Wingeds on the other hand...
2015-01-31 14:55:18	@Espyo	wait what?!
2015-01-31 14:55:21	@Espyo	Wingeds are midway?
2015-01-31 14:55:44	@Espyo	Rain forest treetops is winged...
2015-01-31 14:55:47	@Espyo	I seriously can't...
2015-01-31 14:55:55	@Espyo	Yellow Pikmin's thing is being up high
2015-01-31 14:56:23	@Espyo	but Reds LIKE fire
2015-01-31 14:56:30	@Espyo	why would they like firetrucks, the fire's natural enemy?
2015-01-31 14:56:46	@Espyo	all in all...
2015-01-31 14:56:50	@Espyo	it's a horrible quiz
2015-01-31 14:56:51	@Espyo	damn
2015-01-31 14:57:09	Yoshi2	heh
2015-01-31 14:57:21	@Espyo	it's just meant to be a silly thing, sure, but
2015-01-31 14:57:37	@Espyo	it makes me each time more convinced that not everybody that works at Nintendo knows what they're doing when they're tasked to do something
2015-01-31 14:57:46	Yoshi2	welcome to the world of "Check out which character you are"-Quizzes
2015-01-31 14:57:54	@Espyo	yeah, I guess...
2015-01-31 15:00:46	Yoshi2	if you manage to answer the questions in such a way that each answer belongs to a different pikmin, it appears to choose the first pikmin
2015-01-31 15:02:43	Yoshi2	i.e. the pikmin belonging to the first answer
2015-01-31 15:03:43	Yoshi2	other than that, it goes with the pikmin that has the most answers you chose
2015-01-31 15:05:20	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-31 15:07:26	Yoshi2	I do need to ask myself why I am dissecting a quiz page directed at children and people who don't play video games that much
2015-01-31 15:11:56	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-01-31 15:12:07	@Espyo	you know, I never really thought about the quiz that way
2015-01-31 15:12:10	@Espyo	I mean, sure, kids
2015-01-31 15:12:19	@Espyo	but the part about it being who aren't 100% knowledgeable on the series...
2015-01-31 15:12:20	@Espyo	makes sense
2015-01-31 15:12:26	@Espyo	WE know what answers equal what
2015-01-31 15:12:29	@Espyo	but this is for people who don't
2015-01-31 15:12:38	@Espyo	still, it isn't really that good, because of the stuff I said before...
2015-01-31 15:13:06	@Espyo	White Pikmin being able to only carry super-light things, give me a break...
2015-01-31 15:13:26	Testyo	did you think about Snowhead?

2015-01-31 16:46:03	@J	for some reason I missed it
2015-01-31 16:48:08	@Espyo	the div is precisely because of multiline

2015-01-31 18:00:34	@J	I'm not sure what you're trying to do
2015-01-31 18:01:08	@J	you want to copy one commit on branch A into branch B?
2015-01-31 18:01:34	@Espyo	mhm
2015-01-31 18:02:02	Yoshi2	seems like something cherry-picking could do
2015-01-31 18:02:14	Yoshi2	but I am clueless when it comes to git stuff
2015-01-31 18:07:03	@J	yeah, you just checkout branch B, then 'git cherry-pick <commit ID>'
2015-01-31 18:07:34	@J	this will create a copy of the commit on branch B, so it won't have the same ID as the original, and will conflict with itself if you merge those branches
2015-01-31 18:08:32	@J	if you're just trying to avoid merging some of the changes from A into B, you can always 'git merge <commit ID>' if it's only commits after the commit in question that you don't want

2015-02-01 12:26:02	@Espyo	but he insists that he wants to adopt and reflourish the wikia
2015-02-01 12:26:18	@Espyo	we kept trying to explain to him that there aren't meant to be two wikis, so he can't take the old one
2015-02-01 12:26:26	@Espyo	the old one is old, and it's meant to stay old
2015-02-01 12:26:29	@Espyo	he just does not get the point
2015-02-01 12:26:38	@Espyo	he insists on wanting to bring it back to life
2015-02-01 12:26:47	@Espyo	and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope, here
2015-02-01 12:26:55	@Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:22034
2015-02-01 12:31:45	@J	[12:06:30] Testyo Afternoon everyone!
2015-02-01 12:31:47	Testyo	in Pikmin 2 the developer seem to have done ripped the music
2015-02-01 12:32:16	@Espyo	I know, I know
2015-02-01 12:39:10	@J	that was at Yoshi
2015-02-01 12:39:40	@J	I read some of the stuff, seems like you're all just saying the same things again every time
2015-02-01 12:41:50	@Espyo	what else CAN we say?
2015-02-01 12:42:04	@Espyo	the concept literally is as simple as "we don't want this old thing to be a thing any more"
2015-02-01 12:44:49	@J	and the guy understands that, so why keep saying it?
2015-02-01 12:45:19	@J	I would get pretty annoyed if someone kept making the same argument, as if I'm not intelligent enough to get it the first time

2015-02-01 12:49:35	@Espyo	he's not
2015-02-01 12:49:42	@Espyo	he insists on continuing despite what we said
2015-02-01 12:49:52	@Espyo	what else can we do? let him?
2015-02-01 12:50:02	@J	he's not what?
2015-02-01 12:50:15	@Espyo	he's not getting it the first time
2015-02-01 12:50:18	@J	he really is
2015-02-01 12:50:25	@J	he just doesn't agree
2015-02-01 12:50:28	@J	there's a difference
2015-02-01 12:50:43	@Espyo	right... but
2015-02-01 12:50:48	@Espyo	what can we do if not try to explain in different terms?
2015-02-01 12:50:54	@Espyo	hopefully there's something he's not getting
2015-02-01 12:50:56	@Espyo	I mean, not any more
2015-02-01 12:51:00	@Espyo	I'm tired of rewording what I said
2015-02-01 12:51:06	@Espyo	but what could we have done?
2015-02-01 12:52:29	@J	I'll think about it, but I'm not sure; I'm just saying that's a pretty good way to make the guy think twice about using Pikipedia
2015-02-01 12:53:32	@Espyo	I get that, and it's not like I wanted to
2015-02-01 12:53:51	@Espyo	but you know darn well we can't really assume that somebody on the internet gets the point on the first go
2015-02-01 12:54:05	@Espyo	specially somebody who really can't understand the things the way they need to
2015-02-01 12:55:52	@J	I would say the starting point now is to understand what he's saying (he doesn't want people going to pikmin.wikia to think there's no real Pikmin community), decide if you agree, and see if you can come up with a way to reconcile that with 'everyone should only use Pikipedia'
2015-02-01 12:55:58	@J	now lunch
2015-02-01 12:57:13	@Espyo	see, that's just the point
2015-02-01 12:57:16	@Espyo	I did see his points
2015-02-01 12:57:46	@Espyo	he wants to keep editing the old wiki so that people who come looking for a wiki don't see the wikia, see it in shambles, and think that Pikmin fans suck
2015-02-01 12:58:11	@Espyo	but he fails to see that in the long run, that'll just create a loop of good quality to more people joining, to higher quality, to ...
2015-02-01 12:58:18	@Espyo	once again leaving Pikipedia in the dust
2015-02-01 12:58:27	@Espyo	"hurr durr, overreacting", you might be thinking
2015-02-01 12:58:46	@Espyo	until you remember that it really only took one of the Pikmin Wiki guys to become admin and revive it
2015-02-01 12:59:30	@J	I don't mean decide if you agree with his solution, I mean decide if you agree with his goal
2015-02-01 12:59:55	@Espyo	not really getting the difference
2015-02-01 13:00:00	@Espyo	his goal is... a goal
2015-02-01 13:00:08	@Espyo	a good one? not really
2015-02-01 13:00:26	@J	well, lunch is ready, I'll talk more after
2015-02-01 13:00:31	@Espyo	okay, go on
2015-02-01 13:00:41	@Espyo	enjoy
2015-02-01 13:00:46	@Espyo	hm, and I have to brb too, so...
2015-02-01 13:04:48	Yoshi2	that is quite a complicated matter
2015-02-01 13:08:25	Yoshi2	I suppose a message saying "Hey, the wiki is now at XYZ" is not an option?
2015-02-01 13:22:22	@Espyo	we did that
2015-02-01 13:22:24	@Espyo	countless times
2015-02-01 13:48:43	@J	oh, this
2015-02-01 13:49:12	@Espyo	...now I've got lunch
2015-02-01 13:49:35	@J	'kay
2015-02-01 14:10:58	@Espyo	all right, here I am
2015-02-01 14:19:51	@J	yeah, I was just saying that his goal is to avoid people getting bad impressions of the Pikmin community - he wants them to be able to find it, if they're looking for it
2015-02-01 14:20:00	@J	and I expect we all agree with that
2015-02-01 14:20:22	@Espyo	of course
2015-02-01 14:20:38	@J	his problem is that a poorly maintained/vandalised Wikia site has that effect
2015-02-01 14:20:44	@J	and I agree with that, not sure about you
2015-02-01 14:21:31	@J	so the question is, is there any other solution to the problem than maintaining the Wikia site?  (that sounds rhetorical, but it's not
2015-02-01 14:21:32	@J	)
2015-02-01 14:21:33	@Espyo	of course I do
2015-02-01 14:22:00	@Espyo	the solution would be to focus our resources into getting people to understand that there are two wikis, instead of focusing them on cleaning up the welcoming mat
2015-02-01 14:23:43	@J	how would you do that?  Obviously there's the problem of Wikia staff interfering - but also people seeing a mess on the main page will just turn them away before they read any such notice
2015-02-01 14:24:08	@Espyo	the wikia staff doesn't seem to be in the way, that much
2015-02-01 14:24:11	@J	does it make sense to have a well-presented main page?  People are likely to enter the site through other pages, though
2015-02-01 14:24:19	@Espyo	I've already told like 6 or 7 people to come to Pikipedia, and the staff doesn't care
2015-02-01 14:24:30	@Espyo	I'd say the main page is one of the least visited, to be honest
2015-02-01 14:24:40	@Espyo	people might normally come from search engines
2015-02-01 14:24:57	@J	I think they would care more if people were told to move on main pages, rather than talk pages
2015-02-01 14:25:06	@Espyo	I suppose
2015-02-01 14:25:10	@J	since then it becomes the 'site's opinion'
2015-02-01 14:25:21	@Espyo	with having a clean main page, it would of course give readers a good impression of the community
2015-02-01 14:25:28	@Espyo	...but it would also give a good impression of that wiki
2015-02-01 14:25:33	@Espyo	which would encourage them to contribute more
2015-02-01 14:25:38	@Espyo	which would increase the quality
2015-02-01 14:25:44	@Espyo	and... well, we know how that ended up last time
2015-02-01 14:26:14	@J	how about trying to shift the focus of the main page (and possible the whole wiki through sidebar/banner/etc.) to be almost a portal to other Pikmin community sites
2015-02-01 14:26:28	@J	now, Wikia can complain about a thing that says 'go to Pikipedia instead'
2015-02-01 14:26:35	@J	but linking to forums prominently?
2015-02-01 14:26:44	@J	and if you have other links, why can't you mention other wikis?
2015-02-01 14:27:03	@Espyo	>how about trying to shift the focus of the main page
2015-02-01 14:27:05	@Espyo	but how?
2015-02-01 14:27:25	@Espyo	but the thing is, that would just "point out" an alternate wiki
2015-02-01 14:27:36	@Espyo	instead of going for our ultimate goal to drive everybody away from wikia
2015-02-01 14:27:58	@J	yeah, I know
2015-02-01 14:28:28	@Espyo	so it wouldn't be optimal
2015-02-01 14:28:41	@Espyo	the way I see it, we can win by gaining ground on search engines
2015-02-01 14:28:47	@Espyo	when people search, they'll see two wikis
2015-02-01 14:28:56	@Espyo	they'll go for the first, naturally wikia, and dislike it
2015-02-01 14:29:01	@J	I'm just thinking, what if the first thing you see is 'hey, look at all these great Pikmin resources, all these places all over the internet with active Pikmin fans'?
2015-02-01 14:29:10	@Espyo	but as long as we can at least be in their minds as an alternative, people will at least try to go to Pikipedia and try it out
2015-02-01 14:29:34	@Espyo	that could be one of the things a person sees, yes, but what are you getting at?
2015-02-01 14:30:09	@J	people are visiting Wikia a lot, still, and there's a lot that could be done to get them from there to other sites
2015-02-01 14:30:22	@J	and it could be presented as a compromise to the guy you're talking with
2015-02-01 14:30:55	@Espyo	do we have no alternative?
2015-02-01 14:31:21	@J	this is an alternative to him maintaining all the content
2015-02-01 14:31:34	@Espyo	yes
2015-02-01 14:31:43	@Espyo	but is it an ideal alternative for Pikipedia to flourish?
2015-02-01 14:31:56	@Espyo	I'm just really scared about Pikmin 4
2015-02-01 14:31:59	@Espyo	it's been pretty much confirmed
2015-02-01 14:32:03	@J	he's already said no to your suggestions, so
2015-02-01 14:32:03	@Espyo	or at least a spin-off
2015-02-01 14:32:14	@Espyo	and people WILL go to wikia again
2015-02-01 14:32:23	@Espyo	by then, I guess we could point people out that Pikipedia is the way to go
2015-02-01 14:32:32	@Espyo	...but we would have to do that like 5 times a day for everybody that joins
2015-02-01 14:32:33	@J	also try and get the guy into IRC
2015-02-01 14:32:42	@J	or the Skype thing
2015-02-01 14:32:45	@Espyo	we already tried to get him on skype
2015-02-01 14:32:49	@J	hmm
2015-02-01 14:32:49	@Espyo	I... don't know how that worked out
2015-02-01 14:32:50	@Espyo	hm
2015-02-01 14:32:53	@J	I didn't see that
2015-02-01 14:32:54	@Espyo	I'll ask
2015-02-01 14:33:01	@J	well, it was a good idea
2015-02-01 14:33:03	@Espyo	might've been when I was away
2015-02-01 14:33:18	@J	and not to suddenly ambush him with arguments
2015-02-01 14:33:33	@J	just ignore it and get him to be a member of the community
2015-02-01 14:33:41	@Espyo	right
2015-02-01 14:34:08	@Espyo	normally, he edits at around 11:00
2015-02-01 14:34:19	@Espyo	so I'm guessing he's American, and that's his 15:00 or so
2015-02-01 14:34:45	@Espyo	I'll try asking him now, but no guarantees about when he'll get the message
2015-02-01 14:36:54	@Espyo	ideally...
2015-02-01 14:37:11	@Espyo	we'd have a way to tell almost everybody that the community is all at Pikipedia, and that Pikipedia is updated, more complete, etc.
2015-02-01 14:37:29	@Espyo	I don't fancy the idea of us being a wiki "alongside" the wikia
2015-02-01 14:37:36	@J	yeah, I know
2015-02-01 14:37:39	@Espyo	some NIWA wikis chose to coexist peacefully
2015-02-01 14:37:46	@Espyo	others didn't
2015-02-01 14:37:56	@Espyo	there really is no easy way for this, huh
2015-02-01 14:38:03	@Espyo	kirbyddd or not, there just is no easy way
2015-02-01 14:38:10	@Espyo	I think the best we can do is try
2015-02-01 14:38:14	@Espyo	and then take it from there
2015-02-01 14:38:21	@Espyo	Pikmin 4 might be the way
2015-02-01 14:38:30	@Espyo	if we can at least reach SmashWiki status, I'll be pleased
2015-02-01 14:38:38	@J	um
2015-02-01 14:38:39	@Espyo	for SmashWiki, anybody who wants Smash Bros. info goes there
2015-02-01 14:38:39	@J	I
2015-02-01 14:38:45	@Espyo	nobody is dumb enough to--
2015-02-01 14:38:47	@Espyo	J...
2015-02-01 14:38:52	@J	I just checked, and I made my frist commit almost 8 years ago
2015-02-01 14:38:56	@Espyo	oh
2015-02-01 14:39:04	@Espyo	I thought you were gonna say you go to the Smash wiki for Smash info
2015-02-01 14:39:12	@Espyo	wait, first commit on what?
2015-02-01 14:39:16	@Espyo	wait, Git was around 8 years ago?
2015-02-01 14:41:28	@J	uh
2015-02-01 14:41:28	@J	.......
2015-02-01 14:41:30	@J	*edit
2015-02-01 14:41:34	@J	*first
2015-02-01 14:43:36	@Espyo	heh
2015-02-01 14:43:55	@Espyo	yep, the wiki's been around for that long
2015-02-01 14:44:39	@J	and the wiki becomes 10 this year
2015-02-01 14:44:55	@Espyo	it's really hard to grasp that concept
2015-02-01 14:45:26	@J	there are probably younger editors
2015-02-01 14:46:12	@Espyo	...
2015-02-01 14:46:14	@Espyo	I didn't even think of that
2015-02-01 14:46:17	@Espyo	you're right
2015-02-01 14:46:18	@Espyo	wow
2015-02-01 14:46:32	Yoshi2	my gamecube is close to being 10 years old
2015-02-01 14:47:00	Yoshi2	I received it either in 2005 or early 2006
2015-02-01 14:49:16	@J	I think I got mine with Pokémon Colosseum
2015-02-01 14:49:19	@J	so...

2015-02-01 15:21:26	@J	looking at this, how do you think it works?
2015-02-01 15:22:26	@Espyo	this runs a collection of scripts, I'm guessing?
2015-02-01 15:22:54	@Espyo	on the first box, you can choose what to add to the file filters
2015-02-01 15:23:07	@Espyo	a pattern, probably some criteria like creation date and such
2015-02-01 15:23:21	@Espyo	as for the rest, I'm really without context
2015-02-01 15:23:32	Yoshi2	the noob inside me would be confused by how the Files part does not have a "Choose file" button
2015-02-01 15:23:59	@Espyo	hehe yeah
2015-02-01 15:24:02	@J	http://i.imgur.com/W2f56sE.png
2015-02-01 15:24:14	@J	that's teh part I'm asking about, really
2015-02-01 15:24:22	@J	how do you add file sources
2015-02-01 15:24:23	@J	*the
2015-02-01 15:24:24	@J	etc.
2015-02-01 15:25:05	@Espyo	well, after you pick one of those options from the drop-down
2015-02-01 15:25:15	@Espyo	a dialog appears
2015-02-01 15:25:33	@Espyo	with a native file chooser, or with a place where you can type a (guessing regex) pattern
2015-02-01 15:25:45	@Espyo	and that adds that as a rule
2015-02-01 15:25:49	@Espyo	and you can stack rules
2015-02-01 15:26:02	@Espyo	so only files that have "asd" in the name, but from this selection of files
2015-02-01 15:26:02	@J	http://i.imgur.com/cwDEfNQ.png this is how it used to be
2015-02-01 15:26:15	@Espyo	that works too
2015-02-01 15:26:16	@J	I'm just asking if it's any less clear now
2015-02-01 15:26:20	@Espyo	except more GUI
2015-02-01 15:26:28	@Espyo	well, the "+" is a giveaway
2015-02-01 15:26:32	@Espyo	but I don't think everybody would get it
2015-02-01 15:26:37	@Espyo	depends on who the program is for
2015-02-01 15:26:44	@Espyo	is this that GameCube ISO program?
2015-02-01 15:26:54	@J	'for those who understand regular expressions, glob-style patterns and maybe a little scripting'
2015-02-01 15:27:04	@J	no, this is the file renamer
2015-02-01 15:27:08	@Espyo	oh
2015-02-01 15:27:14	@J	http://ikn.org.uk/imgs/farragone/main.png
2015-02-01 15:27:37	@Espyo	btw, the list at the right should be a table
2015-02-01 15:27:45	@J	yeah, it's on the todo list
2015-02-01 15:27:55	@J	plus I need to shorten the paths somehow
2015-02-01 15:27:57	@Espyo	I guess the two-widget style is more understandable
2015-02-01 15:28:02	@J	plus add results tabs
2015-02-01 15:28:06	@J	plus a million other things
2015-02-01 15:28:10	@Espyo	although you really can't do anything on the dropdown-only style except choose, so...
2015-02-01 15:28:15	@Espyo	not like there's a lot of room for confusion
2015-02-01 15:28:21	@Espyo	so I'd go with just a dropodown
2015-02-01 15:28:23	@Espyo	*dropdown
2015-02-01 15:28:24	@J	okay
2015-02-01 15:28:32	@J	the reason I changed is because less clicks
2015-02-01 15:28:40	@Espyo	it's the same number, really
2015-02-01 15:28:43	@Espyo	one click to —
2015-02-01 15:28:44	@Espyo	wait, no
2015-02-01 15:28:45	@Espyo	never mind
2015-02-01 15:28:55	@Espyo	yeah, less clicks, less bloat, it's always better
2015-02-01 15:28:57	@J	yep
2015-02-01 15:29:24	@Espyo	I slowly started understanding that overblown GUIs really confuse people, even when they don't look like they do
2015-02-01 15:29:28	@Espyo	that's why some tutorials fail
2015-02-01 15:29:32	@Espyo	they just dump info all at once
2015-02-01 15:29:42	@Espyo	if a person knows that the next thing they want to do is open a file
2015-02-01 15:29:47	@Espyo	but there are 30 buttons to open files
2015-02-01 15:29:50	@Espyo	they might as well give up
2015-02-01 15:29:53	@J	yeah
2015-02-01 15:30:09	@Espyo	that said, design is pretty fun
2015-02-01 15:30:13	@Espyo	pretty stressful, too
2015-02-01 15:30:21	@J	make it simple, while trying not to lose the features
2015-02-01 15:30:37	@J	yeah, I'm realising that I quite like design lately
2015-02-01 15:31:22	@Espyo	the more you understand what you should do when designing, the better it is
2015-02-01 15:31:39	@J	well, I made a release today, and my main plan for next release is Windows support
2015-02-01 15:31:57	@Espyo	hehehehe, good luck
2015-02-01 15:32:08	@J	I got a design book recently, actually, need to get around to reading that
2015-02-01 15:32:15	@Espyo	oh, nice
2015-02-01 15:32:24	@J	yeah, hopefully it won't be too much work, but you never know
2015-02-01 15:32:38	@J	I'll probably be looking for testers in a week or so
2015-02-01 15:33:48	@Espyo	okay
2015-02-01 15:34:17	@Espyo	inb4 my C:/ drive's files are all renamed to garbage
2015-02-01 15:34:35	@Espyo	there was a bug recently in some very big thing that deleted the / folder on Linux
2015-02-01 15:34:54	@J	really?
2015-02-01 15:35:03	@J	I mean, you can't delete /, just its contents
2015-02-01 15:35:07	@J	but I never heard of that
2015-02-01 15:35:27	@Espyo	rm -rf / usr/blabla/blabla
2015-02-01 15:35:33	@Espyo	the code was something like that ^
2015-02-01 15:35:38	Testyo	you cant there's no exe icon
2015-02-01 15:35:44	@J	thanks Testyo
2015-02-01 15:35:45	Testyo	it's legal enough, Nintendo barely cares, and if they do, we never added obstacle plants before
2015-02-01 15:35:58	@J	that looks so easy to do
2015-02-01 15:36:05	@Espyo	you can't rm -rf because rm doesn't have an .exe icon
2015-02-01 15:36:07	@Espyo	seems legit
2015-02-01 15:36:07	Yoshi2	would be interesting to have a feature that allows you to check which files/folders will be affected
2015-02-01 15:36:18	@Espyo	<J> that looks so easy to do
2015-02-01 15:36:19	@Espyo	precisely
2015-02-01 15:36:22	@Espyo	it's scary...
2015-02-01 15:37:20	Yoshi2	good point testy o, even if nintendo cares, all that counts is that we never added obstacle plants before
2015-02-01 15:38:26	@J	https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671 this?
2015-02-01 15:38:42	@J	Yoshi2: what do you mean?
2015-02-01 15:39:18	@J	that's scary because I've tried to do that before (move the steam directory and create a link to it)
2015-02-01 15:39:35	@Espyo	uuuuhhh...
2015-02-01 15:39:41	@Espyo	I think it wasn't Steam
2015-02-01 15:39:42	@Espyo	it was something else
2015-02-01 15:39:58	@Espyo	...so that's TWO big things that had a "remove an important folder" problem
2015-02-01 15:41:09	Yoshi2	J: in case you manage to make a vague regex pattern or something like that, you can check which folders will be affected in the process
2015-02-01 15:42:52	@Espyo	oh, found it
2015-02-01 15:42:54	@Espyo	it was bumblebee
2015-02-01 15:43:26	@Espyo	https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/issues/123
2015-02-01 15:43:32	@Espyo	it's actually /usr
2015-02-01 15:47:03	@J	Yoshi2: the right panel previews what will happen; does that count?
2015-02-01 15:47:07	@J	[15:27:14] @J http://ikn.org.uk/imgs/farragone/main.png
2015-02-01 15:47:27	@J	I use bumblebee too
2015-02-01 15:47:32	@J	but not that long ago
2015-02-01 15:48:31	Yoshi2	J: does the preview appear before you start the renaming process?
2015-02-01 15:48:35	@J	yeah
2015-02-01 15:48:40	@J	it updates as you change stuff
2015-02-01 15:48:44	Yoshi2	ah, nice
2015-02-01 15:48:47	@J	yeah, sorry, I guess that looks like the output instead
2015-02-01 15:49:08	Yoshi2	heh, yeah, that's what I thought it looked like at first
2015-02-01 15:50:13	Yoshi2	but if it shows what will happen, then that is exactly what I meant
2015-02-01 15:50:56	@J	great
2015-02-01 15:51:15	@J	yeah, preview had to be in the first version
2015-02-01 15:51:21	@J	can't really do this without it

2015-02-01 16:00:26	@J	(clicking only adds one)
2015-02-01 16:00:45	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2015-02-01 16:00:47	@Espyo	Qt issue?

2015-02-01 16:59:05	Mariostar	Yoshi,someguy on Miiverse publicly said their password
2015-02-01 16:59:35	Mariostar	Before they got their first ban from saying it in several places,l got a good half hour with it.
2015-02-01 17:01:37	Yoshi2	odd
2015-02-01 17:02:19	Mariostar	You want to try and get in,he's banned now,but i'll be back with it.
2015-02-01 17:02:38	Mariostar	When he doesn't expect it,i'll teach him about what he did.

2015-02-01 20:07:58	Shard1	I know, right? It's like 20:00 over there, right?
2015-02-01 20:08:09	Shard1	wait, 21:00
2015-02-01 20:09:04	Yoshi2	21 here
2015-02-01 20:09:12	Shard1	yup, thought so
2015-02-01 20:09:25	Shard1	In Europe, it's always 7 hours ahead
2015-02-01 20:09:40	Shard1	then, it's just a matter of changing it to military time
2015-02-01 20:14:49	@J	there are at least 3 timezones in Europe
2015-02-01 20:15:17	Yoshi2	yup
2015-02-01 20:15:21	Shard1	really?
2015-02-01 20:15:29	Yoshi2	similar to how the USA has several timezones
2015-02-01 20:15:53	Shard1	Oh yeah, because it's different in Washington than in New York
2015-02-01 20:16:42	Yoshi2	I think it ranges from UTC+0 to at least UTC+3, but don't quote me on that
2015-02-01 20:17:18	Shard1	I just remember how I figured out your time! The miiverse boot-up screen
2015-02-01 20:17:28	@J	Iceland is 0 I think, so that probably is the minimum
2015-02-01 20:17:32	Shard1	It's always seven hours ahead of my time

2015-02-02 16:33:41	UltraMario	i am persistent
2015-02-02 16:33:53	UltraMario	it's just i hate how the special stages are designed
2015-02-02 16:33:59	UltraMario	meaning you have only 1 try
2015-02-02 16:34:18	Shard1	harsh
2015-02-02 16:34:22	UltraMario	or you're screwed of retrying that special stage until the next level
2015-02-02 16:35:19	Yoshi2	the big deal about MM 3DS is that it is a major remake of the original game, with better graphics, a framerate that isn't abysmal and some other things which I can't remember right now
2015-02-02 16:35:37	Yoshi2	and a lot of people who played MM liked it
2015-02-02 16:35:50	UltraMario	also swimming is easier
2015-02-02 16:35:52	Shard1	Yup, never played it, that's why I'm not exactly on the hype train
2015-02-02 16:36:04	UltraMario	which makes gyorg less up a pain
2015-02-02 16:36:23	UltraMario	don't you mean...
2015-02-02 16:36:30	UltraMario	A majorA remake? ;)
2015-02-02 16:36:35	Shard1	:P
2015-02-02 16:36:43	UltraMario	heh heh
2015-02-02 16:36:48	UltraMario	eh screw it
2015-02-02 16:36:59	Yoshi2	you are so punny today ;)
2015-02-02 16:37:07	UltraMario	i'll never be able to 100% sonic 1 or 2 without save states D:
2015-02-02 16:37:21	Yoshi2	I never played MM myself, and I'm still on the hype train
2015-02-02 16:37:25	Yoshi2	which has no brakes, btw
2015-02-02 16:37:33	Yoshi2	the hype train never has brakes
2015-02-02 16:37:42	UltraMario	until the game comes out
2015-02-02 16:37:46	UltraMario	then it does
2015-02-02 16:38:10	Shard1	Well, unless you don't have a 3DS
2015-02-02 16:39:02	Shard1	Backfire!
2015-02-02 16:39:08	Yoshi2	a 3DS is worth having

2015-02-02 17:03:06	Shard1	But out of all the items, what would you reccomend?
2015-02-02 17:05:50	Yoshi2	what items are available?
2015-02-02 17:06:07	Shard1	I'll give you a link

2015-02-02 17:08:40	Yoshi2	hmm, some of those physical rewards are quite neat
2015-02-02 17:09:29	Yoshi2	Golden Sun is an awesome RPG
2015-02-02 17:10:01	Yoshi2	odd that it has the same price as the nes titles
2015-02-02 17:10:50	Yoshi2	Wonderful 101 for 600 coins o.o
2015-02-02 17:11:05	Yoshi2	great game though
2015-02-02 17:11:13	Shard1	I'm really stuck in between the Messanger Bag and the Pikmin poster, with WWHD poster and Luigi poster
2015-02-02 17:11:17	UltraMario	game & wario is fun
2015-02-02 17:12:13	Yoshi2	I haven't heard a lot of good things about game & wario
2015-02-02 17:12:42	UltraMario	some people just dislike it for being different from the standard warioware games
2015-02-02 17:12:49	UltraMario	but i thought it was decent. :)
2015-02-02 17:13:45	Yoshi2	wonderful 101 is pretty good, if you don't mind that kind of gameplay
2015-02-02 17:14:27	Shard1	I need thoughts on the Messenger bag and the posters
2015-02-02 17:15:04	Yoshi2	whaaaat, a number of 3DS titles are there too

2015-02-02 17:16:18	Yoshi2	the MM messenger bag is odd
2015-02-02 17:16:25	Yoshi2	a black image on a black bag
2015-02-02 17:16:32	Yoshi2	can't see anything unless you try

2015-02-02 17:18:29	Yoshi2	the posters are, well, posters
2015-02-02 17:19:37	Yoshi2	I wonder how they look when hung on the wall
2015-02-02 17:20:22	Shard1	But what are the Platinum and Gold Elite Awards?
2015-02-02 17:21:22	Yoshi2	no idea
2015-02-02 17:21:55	Yoshi2	I wonder if NoE will offer similar awards in Europe
2015-02-02 17:22:06	Yoshi2	I wouldn't mind another free game :>
2015-02-02 17:22:19	Yoshi2	Shard1: how many coins does a single game give you in the USA?
2015-02-02 17:22:53	Shard1	About 60
2015-02-02 17:23:16	Yoshi2	ooooh
2015-02-02 17:23:26	Yoshi2	I need to check how many codes I have that are still valid
2015-02-02 17:24:10	Shard1	Hmm, I found the notes to Clock Town Day 1
2015-02-02 17:25:39	Yoshi2	I should probably just register some of them because the stars will likely not disappear before Club Nintendo is discontinued
2015-02-02 17:26:05	Shard1	Okay, so here's my final question: What should I get if I only have 890 coins?
2015-02-02 17:26:48	Yoshi2	the good news is that there is nothing you can't get if you only have 890 coins
2015-02-02 17:27:16	Shard1	yes...
2015-02-02 17:27:53	Yoshi2	what would you rather get, a physical item or a digital item (a game)?
2015-02-02 17:28:04	Shard1	I would, in all honesty, like to get both
2015-02-02 17:28:14	Shard1	But mostly a physical reward
2015-02-02 17:29:35	Yoshi2	the cheapest physical reward is 300 coins, and I think greeting cards are rather lame
2015-02-02 17:30:19	Shard1	yeah
2015-02-02 17:30:50	Shard1	How about I tell you what I don't want?
2015-02-02 17:30:54	Yoshi2	sure
2015-02-02 17:31:49	Shard1	Nothing 3DS related, no greeting cards, no Ultra Hand, no Smash posters, and no sports games
2015-02-02 17:33:08	Yoshi2	do you like extremely cute things? (i.e., animal crossing playing cards)
2015-02-02 17:34:10	Shard1	Umm, I really wouldn't like playing cards either
2015-02-02 17:34:22	Shard1	Now, if they were ZELDA playing cards....
2015-02-02 17:34:35	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-02-02 17:34:41	Yoshi2	zelda playing cards would be awesome
2015-02-02 17:34:55	Shard1	Yes, too bad you can only get the import version
2015-02-02 17:35:54	Yoshi2	that leaves us with a desktop calendar, a retro mario tshirt, three posters with retro luigi, Pikmin 3 and WWHD,a jigsaw puzzle and the messenger bag
2015-02-02 17:36:06	UltraMario	what about wii u games
2015-02-02 17:36:21	Yoshi2	if we only look at physical rewards
2015-02-02 17:37:55	Shard1	None of the full game particularly satisfy me except for Wii Fit U, but that doesn't come with a balance board or a meter.
2015-02-02 17:40:41	Yoshi2	are you interested in any of the GBA or SNES titles listed on the page?
2015-02-02 17:41:54	Yoshi2	I would be, but emulators nowadays can play those games pretty well on the phone
2015-02-02 17:42:18	Shard1	Besides Majoras mask, not really, but I don't have a classic controller
2015-02-02 17:42:21	UltraMario	>emulators
2015-02-02 17:42:36	UltraMario	support the companies dude. :/
2015-02-02 17:44:08	Yoshi2	the thing with the N64 titles is that they are only availabe on the Wii VC, which is too bad
2015-02-02 17:44:14	Shard1	yeah
2015-02-02 17:44:28	Shard1	when will Nintendo kick it up a notch and put THOSE on the Wii U
2015-02-02 17:44:45	Shard1	They already have Wii, so why not N64, which is two generations behind
2015-02-02 17:45:04	Yoshi2	UltraMario: *cough* *cough*
2015-02-02 17:45:13	UltraMario	:
2015-02-02 17:45:15	UltraMario	:|
2015-02-02 17:45:18	Yoshi2	I've been supporting Nintendo as well as I could
2015-02-02 17:46:17	Yoshi2	I've got quite a lot of DS and 3DS games
2015-02-02 17:46:27	UltraMario	too bad
2015-02-02 17:47:08	Shard1	WELL, I, for one, don't have a 3DS, so if Nintendo could maybe make more stuff for the Wii U, or maybe a Zelda Wii Remote... *Eye twitches*
2015-02-02 17:47:38	UltraMario	they already did make a zelda wii remote
2015-02-02 17:47:39	UltraMario	lol
2015-02-02 17:48:21	Yoshi2	when I think about it, the cost of my entire game collection is much higher than I expected
2015-02-02 17:48:21	Shard1	Yeah, but the only way to get that now is on Ebay. where the rip-offs live
2015-02-02 17:49:10	UltraMario	what about amazon
2015-02-02 17:49:43	Yoshi2	not everything offered on amazon is what it seems to be
2015-02-02 17:49:52	Shard1	75 dollars? I don't think so
2015-02-02 17:50:05	Shard1	Sorry, I don't know how to convert to Euro
2015-02-02 17:50:38	Yoshi2	that's around 60€
2015-02-02 17:50:45	Yoshi2	which is not TOO bad
2015-02-02 17:50:57	Yoshi2	I think new wii remotes go for 50€ in retail
2015-02-02 17:51:02	Shard1	They do
2015-02-02 17:52:09	Shard1	Maybe if Nintendo added an Ocarina to the list of Physical rewards in the NEW rewards program...
2015-02-02 17:53:51	Shard1	So, if I maybe bumped up my coins to 900, then what would you recommend getting?
2015-02-02 17:53:58	Yoshi2	there used to be a gold-coloured zelda statue for 15000 stars
2015-02-02 17:55:33	Shard1	Really?
2015-02-02 17:55:42	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-02-02 17:56:19	Yoshi2	pretty neat, but nowadays such a reward would be impossible to achieve
2015-02-02 17:56:52	Yoshi2	that's 60 games worth of stars
2015-02-02 17:57:04	Shard1	WOW
2015-02-02 17:58:34	Shard1	So, if I did get 900 coins, what would you recommend? 
2015-02-02 17:59:57	Yoshi2	well, if you chose the jigsaw puzzle or the bag, 100 coins would not be enough to buy anything else of worth
2015-02-02 18:00:05	Shard1	yeah
2015-02-02 18:00:48	Yoshi2	if you chose the calendar, you would have 500 coins left for ~2 games
2015-02-02 18:01:06	Shard1	Yeah but I really don't want the calander
2015-02-02 18:01:18	Yoshi2	thought so
2015-02-02 18:02:29	Shard1	wait, will there be more rewards or is this it?
2015-02-02 18:02:48	Yoshi2	if you took any of the 700 coins items, you would have 200 coins over which you could use to buy one game
2015-02-02 18:02:57	Yoshi2	no idea if there will be more rewards
2015-02-02 18:03:48	Shard1	probably not
2015-02-02 18:04:05	Shard1	since everybody is saying that these are the last rewards.
2015-02-02 18:04:09	Yoshi2	the digital rewards probably will not become any better than this
2015-02-02 18:04:14	Shard1	But it's the elite rewards that have me wondering
2015-02-02 18:04:48	Shard1	Will there be any?
2015-02-02 18:05:10	Yoshi2	no idea
2015-02-02 18:06:02	Shard1	It's not as if I can get 190 more coins in this short amount of time
2015-02-02 18:06:48	Yoshi2	it is probably worth looking or asking around in bigger nintendo fan communities e.g. on reddit
2015-02-02 18:11:50	Yoshi2	https://www.reddit.com/r/Club_Nintendo/comments/2uif8x/do_you_think_elite_awards_are_going_to_be_the/ looks like other people are unsure too
2015-02-02 18:14:15	Yoshi2	apparently there are a number of free games you can download to get a few more coins
2015-02-02 18:14:28	Yoshi2	https://www.reddit.com/r/Club_Nintendo/comments/2uco1l/chart_documenting_free_eshop_games_that_grant/
2015-02-02 18:15:52	Shard1	So, what should I get?
2015-02-02 18:20:06	--	UltraMario is now known as Punchinello
2015-02-02 18:21:08	--	Punchinello is now known as UltraMario
2015-02-02 18:23:46	Shard1	I'm too busy debating between the messenger bag and the posters.
2015-02-02 18:27:52	Yoshi2	what would speak for the posters is the fact that you could also get one of the VC games, like Yoshi's Island, Golden Sun, SMW, Super Metroid, Super Mario Bros
2015-02-02 18:28:31	Yoshi2	there is also Art Style: CUBELLO, which I guess is a Wii indie title and also costs only 200 coins

2015-02-02 20:24:16	@Espyo	people will obviously come to the wikia first

2015-02-02 20:25:39	@PikFan	if wikia cooperates (0.0000000000001% chance of that happening) then we can guide users away from wikia

2015-02-03 23:29:50	@Espyo	not yet...
2015-02-03 23:29:56	@Espyo	I never find a quick break to buy and watch them
2015-02-03 23:30:22	@Espyo	<Shard1> Does anybody else here play an instrument?
2015-02-03 23:30:27	@Espyo	I can kinda play the recorder
2015-02-03 23:30:31	@Espyo	not anywhere near professional though
2015-02-03 23:30:57	Shard1	Hmm, well, I'm going to be learning violin soon
2015-02-03 23:31:25	Shard1	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHii0iBicA
2015-02-03 23:31:31	Shard1	That is a hilarious post
2015-02-03 23:32:27	Shard1	Hey, what's bremens march?
2015-02-03 23:32:53	@Espyo	isn't that from Majora's Mask?
2015-02-03 23:33:45	Shard1	I have no idea. I'm just looking at this sheet music: http://www.zeldacapital.com/sheet.php
2015-02-03 23:35:18	@Espyo	yeah, the Bremen's march is a jingle that plays when you use the Bremen mask (not sure if that's the name of the mask)
2015-02-03 23:35:22	@Espyo	it allows Link to command young animals
2015-02-03 23:35:38	Shard1	That is actually kind of weird
2015-02-03 23:35:52	Shard1	What does marzial even mean?
2015-02-03 23:36:41	Shard1	Have any of you played The Wonderful 101?
2015-02-03 23:36:54	@Espyo	not yet
2015-02-03 23:37:01	@Espyo	and I never heard of "marzial"
2015-02-03 23:37:28	Shard1	It's apparently a musical term
2015-02-03 23:37:49	@Espyo	hmm
2015-02-03 23:38:11	Shard1	It doesn't come up when I google it
2015-02-03 23:43:26	Shard1	I hate it when somebody does this: https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHii03baWA 
2015-02-03 23:44:20	@Espyo	yeah...

2015-02-03 23:48:05	@Espyo	good job
2015-02-03 23:48:54	Shard1	It probably doesn't seem like much to other people and how do you get that blue font?
2015-02-03 23:49:07	@Espyo	I have a script that automatically paints my text
2015-02-03 23:49:14	@Espyo	although you can click on "Color" below the box where you write the text
2015-02-03 23:49:19	@Espyo	and it changes your text color too
2015-02-03 23:49:35	Shard1	Can I have it like you do so that it changes automatically?
2015-02-03 23:50:12	@Espyo	you'll need something better than Mibbit, which is what you're using
2015-02-03 23:50:26	@Espyo	a different program that can be used to chat on IRC channels
2015-02-03 23:50:32	Shard1	Oh
2015-02-03 23:50:34	@Espyo	it might not be worth the trouble unless you go on loads of IRC channels
2015-02-03 23:50:44	Shard1	Hey! It works!
2015-02-03 23:50:51	Shard1	Now everything is blue
2015-02-03 23:53:50	Shard1	So, what's going on?

2015-02-04 23:22:16	@Espyo	let me give it a spin
2015-02-04 23:24:13	@J	see my edit
2015-02-04 23:24:56	@J	so yeah, maybe just hide all borders but the ones between items

2015-02-04 23:24:59	@J	and have no BG
2015-02-04 23:25:05	@J	otherwise it looks fine
2015-02-04 23:25:16	@J	not sure why we need bullets - likely to have > 1 thing per day?
2015-02-04 23:25:26	@Espyo	...you replaced the main page
2015-02-04 23:25:28	@Espyo	not the sandbox
2015-02-04 23:25:32	@J	no
2015-02-04 23:25:33	@J	...
2015-02-04 23:25:34	@J	wow
2015-02-04 23:25:52	@Espyo	anyway, I've added the box http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Sandbox
2015-02-04 23:26:25	@Espyo	oh, I didn't think of >1 thing per day, but I tried without bullets first, and it was just so bland
2015-02-04 23:27:02	@J	okay, well you just needed to replace all the | with {{!}}
2015-02-04 23:27:02	Testyo	"!" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:!
2015-02-04 23:27:13	@J	except those in templates and links (ie. just the table ones)
2015-02-04 23:27:49	@Espyo	I'll probably create a {{news item}} template

2015-02-04 23:27:56	@Espyo	there's a lot of CSS this time around, too much to copy+paste every time
2015-02-04 23:29:26	@J	maybe try indenting the first line of the paragraph instead of a bullet?
2015-02-04 23:29:36	@J	I don't know, I see what you're saying, but itjust seems weird
2015-02-04 23:29:41	@J	*it just
2015-02-04 23:29:49	@Espyo	(ironic asterisk)
2015-02-04 23:29:55	@Espyo	yeah, I'll try

2015-02-04 23:30:39	@Espyo	...I think the only way to indent the first line is to do some nasty CSS work
2015-02-04 23:30:47	@Espyo	the unsupported type
2015-02-04 23:30:53	@J	still?
2015-02-04 23:30:57	@Espyo	like -moz-first-line-indent or something equally weird
2015-02-04 23:30:59	@J	I thought it was fairly old now
2015-02-04 23:31:07	@Espyo	I could be wrong

2015-02-05 19:20:06	Mariostar	I don't know what theme to get out of 25m or Sanic.
2015-02-05 19:20:07	Testyo	25 m = 27.34 yd / 82.02 ft / 1315.79 Olimar-heights

2015-02-05 19:21:26	Mariostar	Amazing,just for the online alone.
2015-02-05 19:21:43	Waterpikmin	that sounds like a great game!
2015-02-05 19:21:52	Mariostar	It's not in the demo section,but you'll find it.
2015-02-05 19:22:30	Mariostar	l'll probably not buy MH4U,this demo is enough for me,thanks to online,also why l don't own all of Subwars.
2015-02-05 19:22:43	Waterpikmin	i wanted to ask someone this
2015-02-05 19:22:54	Waterpikmin	what do you think pikmin 4 will be like?
2015-02-05 19:23:06	Waterpikmin	im sorta mixed on the answer
2015-02-05 19:23:11	Mariostar	*shrugs shoulders*
2015-02-05 19:23:24	Waterpikmin	i really want to see a coop story
2015-02-05 19:23:33	Mariostar	l just want old areas,no new Pikmin.
2015-02-05 19:24:04	Waterpikmin	in an interview, miyamoto stated that he wants it to be the reason on why people buy the wii u
2015-02-05 19:24:08	Mariostar	a multiplayer with Alph,Brittany,Charlie,Olimar,Louie and the president.
2015-02-05 19:24:25	Waterpikmin	so it will be a huge focus for them in the future

2015-02-05 20:54:33	@Espyo	well, at least you can give him context
2015-02-05 20:54:37	@Espyo	you can't to machines
2015-02-05 20:54:50	@PikFan	heh, that's the thing about machines
2015-02-05 20:54:57	@PikFan	they only think linearly
2015-02-05 20:55:05	@Espyo	that's why I had to create an entire tutorial
2015-02-05 20:55:14	@PikFan	humans have a difference thought process
2015-02-05 20:55:21	@PikFan	*different
2015-02-05 20:55:45	@PikFan	hopefully quantum computers will be more efficient
2015-02-05 20:56:02	@PikFan	...I still don't understand what a qubit is
2015-02-05 20:56:11	@PikFan	quantum bit, apparently
2015-02-05 20:56:19	@PikFan	but I don't understand that
2015-02-05 20:56:34	@Espyo	I think I read a bit
2015-02-05 20:56:37	@Espyo	and quickly dismissed it
2015-02-05 20:57:02	@PikFan	heh

2015-02-05 20:57:52	@PikFan	hmm... maybe tenten isn't even a Japanese word
2015-02-05 20:58:05	@PikFan	maybe it was transcribed wrong
2015-02-05 20:59:03	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-02-05 20:59:06	@Espyo	let me try websites
2015-02-05 20:59:29	@Espyo	google translate says tenten
2015-02-05 20:59:49	@Espyo	so does jisho.org
2015-02-05 20:59:55	@Espyo	let me check the game files if it's really テンテン
2015-02-05 21:00:17	@PikFan	alright, sensei doesn't know
2015-02-05 21:00:26	@Espyo	dammit...
2015-02-05 21:00:38	@PikFan	so I assume it's not a word
2015-02-05 21:00:42	@Espyo	I think this is cryptic like "Ujadani"
2015-02-05 21:00:50	@Espyo	in that you have to know that "uja" is short for "ujauja"
2015-02-05 21:01:07	@PikFan	anyway, I have to go, class is starting
2015-02-05 21:01:13	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-02-05 21:01:14	@Espyo	okay

2015-02-05 22:45:10	@Espyo	good
2015-02-05 22:45:24	@Espyo	I write a class called mob_action
2015-02-05 22:45:40	@Espyo	visual studio complains that it can't recognize the identifier "b_action"
2015-02-05 22:46:06	@Espyo	it would be easier to write individual compiled bits using notepad than it'd be to compile with this piece of shit

2015-02-05 23:29:54	Waterpikmin	hello?
2015-02-05 23:30:25	Waterpikmin	Espyo, i wanted to ask you something
2015-02-05 23:30:38	@Espyo	yeah?
2015-02-05 23:30:51	Waterpikmin	what is the one thing you want in the next installment of pikmin?
2015-02-05 23:30:59	Waterpikmin	ive been wondering this for a while
2015-02-05 23:31:15	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-02-05 23:31:20	@Espyo	I'd like to see real-world treasures back
2015-02-05 23:31:25	@Espyo	but other than that, not anything in particular
2015-02-05 23:31:31	@Espyo	I'll just wait to see what Nintendo does
2015-02-05 23:31:37	Waterpikmin	i want to see more multiplayer playability
2015-02-05 23:31:47	Waterpikmin	like  coop mode to story mode
2015-02-05 23:32:32	Waterpikmin	another prediction i had is that there will be more than 3 captains, but only 3 can be on the map at once, giving an option to choose your captain
2015-02-05 23:32:42	@Espyo	yeah, I'd love online multiplayer
2015-02-05 23:32:46	@Espyo	can't believe I forgot that
2015-02-05 23:32:56	Waterpikmin	omg, i wanted that more than ever
2015-02-05 23:33:03	Waterpikmin	imagine pikmin tournaments
2015-02-05 23:33:21	@Espyo	that'd be awesome
2015-02-05 23:33:34	Waterpikmin	i also want to have a major story plot
2015-02-05 23:33:55	Waterpikmin	i want to see more elaborate descriptions of characters mentioned but not seen
2015-02-05 23:33:59	Waterpikmin	like drake
2015-02-05 23:34:09	Waterpikmin	which could likely be character d
2015-02-05 23:34:50	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-02-05 23:35:01	Waterpikmin	i was thinking about what it would be like to explore hocotate and koppai and be able to talk to ppl around the planet
2015-02-05 23:35:11	Waterpikmin	like and open world experience
2015-02-05 23:35:15	Waterpikmin	an*
2015-02-05 23:35:48	@Espyo	yeah, that'd be interesting
2015-02-05 23:35:58	Waterpikmin	of course, miyamoto did mention that he wanted this game to be a system seller, so that means
2015-02-05 23:36:17	Waterpikmin	nintendo will have this as the highest priority in the future
2015-02-05 23:36:35	Waterpikmin	as for now they are likely to be thinking about the plot
2015-02-05 23:36:40	@Espyo	did he?
2015-02-05 23:36:44	@Espyo	I must've missed that part...
2015-02-05 23:36:53	Waterpikmin	i believe so
2015-02-05 23:37:05	Waterpikmin	i think i heard it on a pikcast
2015-02-05 23:37:08	@Espyo	hm, nice, then
2015-02-05 23:37:09	Waterpikmin	which i loved
2015-02-05 23:37:14	Waterpikmin	oh and
2015-02-05 23:37:22	Waterpikmin	when i first saw pikcast
2015-02-05 23:37:24	@Espyo	I probably wasn't on that episode of Pikcast
2015-02-05 23:37:35	Waterpikmin	i heard the mission mode theme remix
2015-02-05 23:38:02	Waterpikmin	i didnt know it existed until i realized i didnt unlock it
2015-02-05 23:38:09	@Espyo	hehe
2015-02-05 23:38:16	@Espyo	it's a pretty nice song
2015-02-05 23:38:20	@Espyo	I unlocked it before I even knew what it was
2015-02-05 23:38:41	Waterpikmin	i looked it up and heard it and i had my jaw wide open
2015-02-05 23:38:56	Waterpikmin	its truly sad that pikmin in a way is underrated
2015-02-05 23:39:28	Waterpikmin	with mario and zelda and other games like that sorta covering it up
2015-02-05 23:39:58	Waterpikmin	im getting that olimar ammibo
2015-02-05 23:40:11	Waterpikmin	i would die if it was not announced
2015-02-05 23:40:25	@Espyo	it really is underrated...
2015-02-05 23:40:29	@Espyo	well, not underrated
2015-02-05 23:40:33	@Espyo	it's underlooked
2015-02-05 23:40:38	Waterpikmin	exactly
2015-02-05 23:41:01	Waterpikmin	one really great thing about the series is the detail
2015-02-05 23:41:11	@Espyo	yeah, I love every tiny bit of detail
2015-02-05 23:41:15	@Espyo	they're really masters at it
2015-02-05 23:41:20	Waterpikmin	the fact that the map in 3 is pangea ultima is awesome
2015-02-05 23:41:21	@Espyo	well, when they want to
2015-02-05 23:41:25	@Espyo	mhm

2015-02-06 19:37:25	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-02-06 19:37:25	Testyo	but it's all in the next cell
2015-02-06 19:38:01	@Espyo	hi
2015-02-06 19:41:05	Yoshi2	it was suprisingly easy to take apart the xbox controller
2015-02-06 19:41:20	Yoshi2	but I also need to put it together again
2015-02-06 19:46:56	@Espyo	hehe
2015-02-06 19:46:58	@Espyo	good luck
2015-02-06 19:47:08	@Espyo	at least it can't be as bad as my old PC controller
2015-02-06 19:47:16	@Espyo	the triggers...
2015-02-06 19:47:20	@Espyo	they haunt me to this day...
2015-02-06 20:02:37	Yoshi2	the triggers are suprisingly ok
2015-02-06 20:05:15	@Espyo	the problem I had with mine's triggers was that they had nothing to stand on when you reassembled the controller
2015-02-06 20:05:19	@Espyo	there was no support for them
2015-02-06 20:05:29	@Espyo	they just flimsily laid on top of the button sensor
2015-02-06 20:05:45	@Espyo	and if you didn't have the right balance (which is impossible), you'd never close the controller and keep the triggers in place
2015-02-06 20:05:58	@Espyo	...oh, and this controller decided to act up more times than I'd like
2015-02-06 20:06:07	@Espyo	opening and closing that thing once was hell as it is
2015-02-06 20:06:11	@Espyo	now having to do it 10 times...
2015-02-06 20:06:18	@Espyo	good thing it's in the trash now
2015-02-06 20:06:26	@J	.
2015-02-06 20:06:35	@Espyo	hey
2015-02-06 20:06:54	@Espyo	so at work my department head got two raspberry pis delivered to him
2015-02-06 20:07:01	@Espyo	I never knew those things were so... MINUSCULE
2015-02-06 20:07:15	@J	I think some newer smaller version came out?
2015-02-06 20:07:24	@Espyo	I think he got that, yeah
2015-02-06 20:07:35	@Espyo	he's been up and about ordering and getting it delivered for the past few days
2015-02-06 20:07:39	@Espyo	so it's probably as recent as it gets
2015-02-06 20:07:50	@J	...how long does it take to order it?
2015-02-06 20:07:58	@Espyo	and I can't tell if I misheard, but... did he say they can cost as low as 20€?
2015-02-06 20:07:59	Testyo	20 € = £ 17.104  / $ 27.128 
2015-02-06 20:08:04	@J	news looks okay, except that the categories aren't right-aligned
2015-02-06 20:08:06	@Espyo	well, "ordering" doesn't take time, but delivering took him like a week
2015-02-06 20:08:19	@J	yeah, the newest version is cheaper too
2015-02-06 20:08:27	@J	but the cheap version has no ethernet
2015-02-06 20:08:33	@Espyo	oh
2015-02-06 20:08:43	@Espyo	I always imagined the pi to be a thing the size of... well, a Wii, or something
2015-02-06 20:08:47	@Espyo	and cost at least 70€
2015-02-06 20:08:47	Testyo	70 € = £ 59.864  / $ 94.948 
2015-02-06 20:08:52	@Espyo	I was just dumbfounded
2015-02-06 20:09:00	@Espyo	this is why we CAN have nice things
2015-02-06 20:09:16	@J	the size and price are the main selling points
2015-02-06 20:09:19	@Espyo	also, right-aligned? they're meant to all be on the same X
2015-02-06 20:09:24	@Espyo	yeah, I could tell now...
2015-02-06 20:09:34	Yoshi2	nobody would be talking about the Pi if it was 70€
2015-02-06 20:09:34	@Espyo	I mean, I knew the price and size were the main selling points before, but not to THIS degree
2015-02-06 20:09:34	Testyo	70 € = £ 59.864  / $ 94.948 
2015-02-06 20:09:45	@J	yeah, but it looks weird that there's a large gap between them and the right side of the bex
2015-02-06 20:09:46	@J	*box
2015-02-06 20:09:50	@Espyo	well, considering the average crap laptop is around 150€...
2015-02-06 20:10:06	@Espyo	I'd say anything costing 70€ would be worth getting into, specially if it's better than "the average crap laptop"
2015-02-06 20:10:07	Testyo	70 € = £ 59.864  / $ 94.948 
2015-02-06 20:10:21	@Espyo	well, maybe not much better, but it's still a hefty machine
2015-02-06 20:10:41	Yoshi2	the pi has no screen and no input devices
2015-02-06 20:10:49	@Espyo	yeah
2015-02-06 20:10:59	@Espyo	the date, category and text are in a table
2015-02-06 20:11:08	Yoshi2	you'd basically be paying for a motherboard
2015-02-06 20:11:11	@Espyo	date+cat in two cells at the top, text in one at the bottom
2015-02-06 20:11:17	@Espyo	yeah, that's pretty much what the pi is...
2015-02-06 20:11:36	@Espyo	oh, and he bought two of them
2015-02-06 20:11:50	@Espyo	both boxes where they came from could easily fit in my hand, laid side-to-side
2015-02-06 20:11:58	@Espyo	it's ridiculous
2015-02-06 20:12:23	@Espyo	anyway, I'm gonna try an alternate style for the news
2015-02-06 20:12:26	@Espyo	hopefully fix that
2015-02-06 20:12:31	Yoshi2	actually, it is not quite a motherboard
2015-02-06 20:12:39	@Espyo	also, I called in kirbyddd, the guy who's trying to fix the wikia, to come chat tomorrow or sunday
2015-02-06 20:12:43	@Espyo	hopefully we can try to reach something good
2015-02-06 20:12:54	Yoshi2	maybe a motherboard with RAM and cpu included
2015-02-06 20:13:14	Yoshi2	and CPUs usually require a cooler which is very big, preventing you from putting the motherboard anywhere
2015-02-06 20:13:17	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-02-06 20:13:36	Yoshi2	while the pi has everything on it, and is very light weight
2015-02-06 20:14:30	@Espyo	mhm
2015-02-06 20:14:47	Yoshi2	well, operation "Fix the button" appears to have been a success
2015-02-06 20:15:01	Yoshi2	the A button doesn't get stuck so easily on my controller anymore
2015-02-06 20:15:36	Yoshi2	let's test if I broke anything
2015-02-06 20:16:06	@Espyo	good
2015-02-06 20:18:01	Yoshi2	seems to work \o/
2015-02-06 20:18:32	Yoshi2	it really seems that the controller was designed in such a way as to be very easy to repair
2015-02-06 20:18:48	@Espyo	yeah, some really look like they're like that
2015-02-06 20:18:50	@Espyo	others... not so much
2015-02-06 20:20:23	Yoshi2	people don't recommend the xbox 360 controller for no reason
2015-02-06 20:24:11	@Espyo	uhm
2015-02-06 20:24:25	@Espyo	at first I thought you meant that people say bad things about the controller, and they do so for no reason
2015-02-06 20:25:06	Yoshi2	well
2015-02-06 20:26:02	Yoshi2	let me put it like this: there is a reason why a lot of people recommend the x360 controller
2015-02-06 20:29:02	@Espyo	hehe, yeah

2015-02-07 13:28:12	@J	so, uh, my terminal program tells the window manager that it shouldn't be made smaller than one character wide
2015-02-07 13:28:31	@J	but for some reason, there's logic that makes it so that if it _is_ somehow made smaller, it hides the scrollbar
2015-02-07 13:28:37	@J	why would anyone bother to code that?

2015-02-07 13:32:28	@Espyo	it might just be a general thing where if there's not enough space for a scrollbar, it just doesn't exist
2015-02-07 13:32:33	@Espyo	could be a thing with scrollbars themselves, even
2015-02-07 13:32:59	@J	it doesn't use a standard widget toolkit AFAIK
2015-02-07 13:33:04	Mariostar	Hi.

2015-02-07 13:39:16	@J	so I need to improve help/documentation at some point anyway, but I feel like I need a list of available field names somewhere
2015-02-07 13:39:31	@J	http://i.imgur.com/44wsnPS.png here, that's 'ext', 'name1' and 'name2' (name2 = ext)
2015-02-07 13:40:03	@J	but I have no idea where to put it
2015-02-07 13:40:41	@J	maybe in the Template section?
2015-02-07 13:41:12	@Espyo	where to put the format documentation?
2015-02-07 13:41:49	@J	no, the current list of fields
2015-02-07 13:42:02	@J	documentation can probably be 'what's this?'-style
2015-02-07 13:42:13	@J	with the question mark cursor thing
2015-02-07 13:42:22	@Espyo	right
2015-02-07 13:42:40	@Espyo	you probably want a button that opens...
2015-02-07 13:42:42	@Espyo	a dialog box?
2015-02-07 13:42:45	@Espyo	might be a bit awkward
2015-02-07 13:42:53	@J	probably want to see it change in real-time, though
2015-02-07 13:43:04	@J	I just can't visualise a sensible way for it to look
2015-02-07 13:43:15	@Espyo	wait, change?
2015-02-07 13:43:19	@Espyo	I don't think we're talking about the same thing
2015-02-07 13:43:49	@Espyo	you want a place to put some text that says "ame1: this is the name of the file. $ext: extension of the file. ame2: alias for $ext."
2015-02-07 13:43:52	@Espyo	or something else?
2015-02-07 13:44:17	@J	yes, but the user is the one creating the fields
2015-02-07 13:44:22	@J	see the regex in the screenshot
2015-02-07 13:44:35	@J	so I don't know what they are; all I can do is list them
2015-02-07 13:44:40	@J	also fix your 'n' key?
2015-02-07 13:45:01	@Espyo	oh
2015-02-07 13:45:11	@Espyo	nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

2015-02-07 13:45:15	@Espyo	NNNNN
2015-02-07 13:45:18	@Espyo	eh, good enough
2015-02-07 13:45:23	@Espyo	right, I get it now
2015-02-07 13:45:32	@Espyo	hmmmm... don't really think there's a good way to do it
2015-02-07 13:45:34	@J	hmm, I could have it on the right, since it's part of the preview, really
2015-02-07 13:45:42	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-02-07 13:46:00	@Espyo	is the "template" frame widget on the bottom-left of the program gonna have anything else?
2015-02-07 13:46:03	@Espyo	or just that text box?
2015-02-07 13:46:11	@J	I'm considering making the right part a tabbed interface where you can split them into multiple panes viewed at the same time
2015-02-07 13:46:15	@J	just the text box
2015-02-07 13:46:44	@Espyo	seems like a waste just having the text bo
2015-02-07 13:46:45	@Espyo	*x
2015-02-07 13:47:05	@Espyo	hmm... that tab idea might be good
2015-02-07 13:47:45	@J	something like: you have a fixed layout, default one pane, and tabs; if you split it, each shows a different tab (or possibly the same)
2015-02-07 13:47:50	@J	like some text editors work
2015-02-07 13:48:02	@J	tabs inside panes rather than panes inside tabs
2015-02-07 13:49:19	@Espyo	right

2015-02-07 15:53:23	@Espyo	depends on the OS

2015-02-07 15:53:40	@Espyo	oh, wait
2015-02-07 15:53:45	@Espyo	it's dynamic depending on the content
2015-02-07 15:53:51	@Espyo	I can try an empty folder and let you know
2015-02-07 15:54:02	@J	I'm trying to decide which icon to give the exe, since I have different icons for different sizes, but Windows can only handle one
2015-02-07 15:54:12	@Espyo	detail view for me, on an empty folder, in W8
2015-02-07 15:54:20	@Espyo	if I put an image and try opening the folder again...
2015-02-07 15:54:35	@Espyo	"big thumbnails" mode
2015-02-07 15:54:44	@J	hmm
2015-02-07 15:54:59	@Espyo	I think windows can handle more than one
2015-02-07 15:54:59	@J	okay, how about an exe and some other stuff without icons?
2015-02-07 15:55:09	@Espyo	I'll check
2015-02-07 15:55:28	@Espyo	how am I not surprised...
2015-02-07 15:55:35	@Espyo	I deleted the "New folder" folder
2015-02-07 15:55:41	@Espyo	created a new "New folder"
2015-02-07 15:55:46	@Espyo	...it just kept the view from the previous folder
2015-02-07 15:55:48	@J	hmm, actually, I seem to recall that you can put multiple icons in the .ico file
2015-02-07 15:55:51	@J	maybe that does a thing
2015-02-07 15:55:56	@Espyo	so chances are the results will be biased if I continue
2015-02-07 15:56:04	@Espyo	you can put multiple icons
2015-02-07 15:58:01	@J	oh, that's actually working
2015-02-07 15:58:08	@J	yeah, multiple in the .ico and it chooses the right one
2015-02-07 15:58:18	@J	never thought to try that before
2015-02-07 15:59:01	Yoshi2_	makes sense that it supports several icons
2015-02-07 15:59:14	@J	but in a single file, it's a bit weird
2015-02-07 15:59:27	@J	but hey, success

2015-02-07 16:38:53	@Espyo	I know him

2015-02-07 16:39:05	@Espyo	because he speaks (Brazilian) Portuguese
2015-02-07 16:39:29	@Espyo	I guess now TCRF is just like "whatever, we'll fix it all at once every few weeks"

2015-02-07 16:41:28	@Espyo	that "link child" is a dead giveaway
2015-02-07 16:41:39	@Espyo	Porcino has been editing a LOT on the N64 Zelda game pages for the past few months
2015-02-07 16:41:53	@Espyo	plus if I needed some extra reassurance, there's that "link child" instead of "child link"
2015-02-07 16:42:10	@Espyo	in Portuguese, you'd say "Link criança" (child Link), but the word "Link" comes first
2015-02-07 16:42:44	Yoshi2	hmm, this particular page was created by a TCRF admin fairly recently, but that might just be the admin moving around some content

2015-02-07 16:47:06	@Espyo	although I'd say even MORE annoying
2015-02-07 16:47:15	@Espyo	at least we don't steal a load of words from English
2015-02-07 16:47:22	@Espyo	for "team", we have "equipa"
2015-02-07 16:47:39	@Espyo	Brazil decided that using "time" (read the same way as the English "team") would be better
2015-02-07 16:47:50	@Espyo	and "game" is "jogo" in Portugal, but it's just "game" in Brazil
2015-02-07 16:48:09	@Espyo	and "goal" is "golo", but in Brazil it's "gól" (also pronounced like the English "goal")
2015-02-07 16:48:20	@Espyo	needless to say, when you hear a Brazilian talking about football... it's half-English
2015-02-07 16:50:20	@J	http://www.niwanetwork.org/forums/index.php?topic=1418.msg25954#msg25954 kind of topical given the recent Wikia discussions

2015-02-07 16:53:15	@Espyo	oh?
2015-02-07 16:53:22	@Espyo	wait, people still post on niwa?
2015-02-07 16:54:53	@Espyo	how in the world can the Starfy wiki have 1000+ articles?
2015-02-07 16:54:59	@Espyo	how freaking much is there to say about Starfy?!

2015-02-07 16:57:15	@Espyo	anyway, I don't think I really have anything to add to the discussion...
2015-02-07 16:57:20	@Espyo	tips for popularity...
2015-02-07 16:57:32	@Espyo	well, I want to say that the mistakes page I made is pretty awesome and interesting
2015-02-07 16:57:41	@Espyo	but there's no factuality about it
2015-02-07 16:58:01	@Espyo	other than that, the front page I say would be a good place to keep clean
2015-02-07 16:58:11	@Espyo	that change in the news style was a good one, I think
2015-02-07 16:58:34	@Espyo	I guess being very accepting of newcomers is also good
2015-02-07 16:58:41	@Espyo	I made the quick start page with that in mind
2015-02-07 16:58:52	@Espyo	the number of people that don't even understand the concept of editing is huge
2015-02-07 16:59:02	@Espyo	so I'm hoping that page is a real game-changer
2015-02-07 17:00:53	Yoshi2	I wouldn't be against a recommendation about staying online on IRC for more than 1 minute
2015-02-07 17:01:12	@Espyo	hehe
2015-02-07 17:05:17	@J	can I just dump what you said in the topic?
2015-02-07 17:05:32	@J	also give me links for the mistakes page and quick start page
2015-02-07 17:05:39	@Espyo	sure

2015-02-07 17:06:02	@Espyo	I think some more "real world" pages would help
2015-02-07 17:06:11	@Espyo	like glitches
2015-02-07 17:06:17	@Espyo	people are pretty up and about glitches
2015-02-07 17:06:22	@Espyo	I think I factually checked that at some point
2015-02-07 17:06:27	@Espyo	or maybe it's just a "feeling" thing
2015-02-07 17:06:33	@Espyo	I mean, there ARE a lot of glitch videos out there
2015-02-07 17:07:03	@Espyo	but yeah, if the Starfy Wiki's got the basics down
2015-02-07 17:07:19	@Espyo	I strongly suggest they approach the technical side of the series
2015-02-07 17:07:30	@Espyo	numeric values, figuring out how some game mechanics work
2015-02-07 17:07:45	@J	look, if you're going to keep saying things, just tell the guy in the topic
2015-02-07 17:07:55	@Espyo	but I don't have an account
2015-02-07 17:08:09	@Espyo	oh, and topics that help speedrunners
2015-02-07 17:08:18	@J	thought so
2015-02-07 17:08:19	@Espyo	if they really expand on that, that can be a "market" they can conquer
2015-02-07 17:08:23	@Espyo	okay, done now
2015-02-07 17:08:29	@J	but I would never call you lazy without proof

2015-02-07 17:08:45	@Espyo	non-existent account
2015-02-07 17:08:46	@Espyo	there's proof
2015-02-07 17:09:10	@J	I meant the proof just now, when you said you won't reply because you're too lazy to create an account
2015-02-07 17:09:19	@Espyo	ah
2015-02-07 17:09:23	@Espyo	well, it's true
2015-02-07 17:09:34	@J	well, I posted
2015-02-07 17:09:35	@Espyo	plus there's also the guilt of creating an account, posting once, and then sleeping in eternal slumber
2015-02-07 17:09:37	@Espyo	okay
2015-02-07 17:10:55	@Espyo	looks good
2015-02-07 17:11:15	@J	you mean like every morning
2015-02-07 17:11:38	@J	never seen this quick start guide
2015-02-07 17:11:56	@J	kind of makes sense, though maybe needs less overlap with [[help:editing]]
2015-02-07 17:11:57	Testyo	"help:editing" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=help:editing
2015-02-07 17:12:15	@J	I get that you want all the basics on one page
2015-02-07 17:12:33	@Espyo	no no, not all basics
2015-02-07 17:12:37	@Espyo	these are the very barebone basics
2015-02-07 17:12:50	@J	but then why bother with nested lists and templates
2015-02-07 17:13:05	@Espyo	well, they're still concepts users should know
2015-02-07 17:13:06	@J	nested lists are really rare
2015-02-07 17:13:15	@Espyo	hm, good point about the lists
2015-02-07 17:13:22	@Espyo	but at the same time, I wanted the page to be a cheat sheet
2015-02-07 17:13:33	@Espyo	though thinking again, it wouldn't be bad to remove the nestness
2015-02-07 17:13:37	@Espyo	nest...ing
2015-02-07 17:13:45	@Espyo	but either way, we really do need a major revamp on everything that's related to he
2015-02-07 17:13:47	@Espyo	*help
2015-02-07 17:13:49	@Espyo	it's all over the place
2015-02-07 17:14:48	@Espyo	though would it REALLY add too much complexity to add a second level?
2015-02-07 17:15:14	@Espyo	(re: lists)
2015-02-07 17:15:25	@Espyo	it's a simple way to learn, in that it's intuitive
2015-02-07 17:15:39	@Espyo	it highlights that you don't need to memorize any specific skill to get a secondary level of indentation
2015-02-07 17:15:47	@Espyo	it's all achieved through intuition
2015-02-07 17:15:54	@Espyo	and I guess it relates with talk page indentation
2015-02-07 17:16:11	@J	[17:13:49] @Espyo it's all over the place
2015-02-07 17:16:14	@J	well it is now
2015-02-07 17:16:19	@Espyo	it was before, too
2015-02-07 17:16:32	@J	obviously lies
2015-02-07 17:16:38	@Espyo	nope
2015-02-07 17:16:40	@J	evidence: I wrote most of the old stuff
2015-02-07 17:17:07	@J	but yeah, sure
2015-02-07 17:17:12	@Espyo	that's evidence enough that it is all splattered around
2015-02-07 17:17:19	@J	however, being retired, I no longer have to care
2015-02-07 17:17:31	@Espyo	yeah
2015-02-07 17:17:35	@Espyo	but morality is another thing
2015-02-07 17:17:47	@J	_almost_ read that as mortality
2015-02-07 17:17:48	@Espyo	also, off-topic, but why is it that when you tell Gimp to increase the selection by 1px, it does so by like 4?
2015-02-07 17:17:57	@Espyo	mortality IS also another thing
2015-02-07 17:18:07	@J	not sure how you're doing it
2015-02-07 17:18:12	@J	with the mouse just zoom in?

2015-02-07 17:19:16	@J	works fine here
2015-02-07 17:19:22	@J	depends on your selection, I guess
2015-02-07 17:19:35	@J	it radiates out 1px, so a circle becomes 2px wider
2015-02-07 17:19:47	@Espyo	weird, I tried 1px too, and it DID grow to 3x3
2015-02-07 17:20:02	@Espyo	hm, might've just been me

2015-02-08 09:40:01	Yoshi2	I haven't tested any windows builds lately

2015-02-08 09:42:31	@J	but if you have any design advice/feature requests, great
2015-02-08 09:43:22	Yoshi2	the size of the file is suprisingly big
2015-02-08 09:43:34	@J	yeah, because it has to include lots of stuff
2015-02-08 09:43:38	@J	Qt is large
2015-02-08 09:44:00	@J	there's a unicode library that's around 20MiB that I managed to shrink to 100KiB, and it's still this big
2015-02-08 09:44:31	@J	by comparison, the source is 40KiB
2015-02-08 09:45:05	@J	oh, and I also have to include an icon set because Windows doesn't expose its system icons to non-Windows languages/UI toolkits
2015-02-08 09:45:20	@J	I _could_ strip that down to only the icons I actually use, but that's work

2015-02-08 10:01:39	Yoshi2	maybe it shouldn't rename a file at all if the regex doesn't match the filename

2015-02-08 11:40:12	Yoshi2	hm, farragone will not rename a file if the destination path already exist
2015-02-08 11:40:37	Yoshi2	which means that if a regex match fails and it tries to rename a file to $name.something, it will only rename one file like that and then stop
2015-02-08 11:48:54	@J	oh, you're back
2015-02-08 11:48:57	@J	...me too
2015-02-08 11:49:35	@J	yeah, so I was thinking of having a warnings tab/pane on the right to indicate when your setup is wrong, including unknown fields
2015-02-08 11:50:30	@J	possibly if you try to run and there are warnings you have to confirm?
2015-02-08 11:51:08	Yoshi2	that does sound good
2015-02-08 11:51:37	@J	regarding readme/help, that's on the todo list - I intend to do a 'what's this?' sort of thing where you click a button then click part of the UI

2015-02-08 12:32:47	Yoshi2	what does the merge function do?
2015-02-08 12:32:48	@Espyo	probably is
2015-02-08 12:32:53	@Espyo	it's the second pastebin

2015-02-08 12:45:19	Yoshi2	I feel like something about that code might be prone to bugs, but I'd have to tinker around with it on paper to be sure
2015-02-08 12:47:16	Yoshi2	if I understood it right, the merge function actually just picks out words between two offsets and puts them into a single string
2015-02-08 12:48:45	Yoshi2	I'd investigate it more right now if I didn't have to learn for my exams which already start next week 
2015-02-08 12:50:22	@Espyo	probably a lot
2015-02-08 12:50:25	@Espyo	this code is old as heck
2015-02-08 12:50:43	@Espyo	I can't even remember EXACTLY what the code does
2015-02-08 12:51:43	Yoshi2	I can almost smell an off-by-one error in the code

2015-02-08 12:56:03	@J	hmm, apparently Brazilian Portuguese treats 0 as singular, and Portuguese treats it as plural?

2015-02-08 15:18:11	@Espyo	seems weird to have a "last-translator" tag
2015-02-08 15:18:16	@Espyo	one person can do it all
2015-02-08 15:18:21	@Espyo	and then somebody comes and fixes one typo
2015-02-08 15:18:29	@Espyo	and the person who did the most work stops being credited anywhere
2015-02-08 15:18:51	@J	yeah, I don't know
2015-02-08 15:18:57	@J	that's what the thing generated
2015-02-08 15:19:19	@Espyo	also, I've checked around
2015-02-08 15:19:33	@Espyo	and no, BR Portuguese still uses 0 "things", just like European Portuguese
2015-02-08 15:20:16	@J	oh, the actual credits happens by translating a 'translator-credits' string (which I haven't got yet because there's no About dialogue)
2015-02-08 15:20:36	@Espyo	...there's also a huge comment at the start of the file with the first translator
2015-02-08 15:20:39	@J	hmm, weird that it would be listed as different, then
2015-02-08 15:21:14	@J	I think that's meant to have all authors
2015-02-08 15:21:19	@J	ie. you add a line for each new author
2015-02-08 15:21:38	@J	I don't know what the last-translator thing actually does, if anything
2015-02-08 15:21:43	@Espyo	hm
2015-02-08 15:21:51	@Espyo	also, last-translator wants my full name
2015-02-08 15:21:58	@Espyo	yeah, no, I'm happy just sharing my first and last name
2015-02-08 15:22:19	@J	that's all it means
2015-02-08 15:22:44	@J	'full name' can mean just first and last, depends on context really
2015-02-08 15:23:06	@J	you're reading too much into the template placeholders
2015-02-08 15:23:41	@Espyo	hm

2015-02-08 15:30:29	@Espyo	we understand your view
2015-02-08 15:30:39	@Espyo	nobody can deny that a LOT of people go to the wikia instead of Pikipedia

2015-02-08 15:31:22	@Espyo	it has the pro of making people not think we're lazy
2015-02-08 15:31:28	@Espyo	but it has the con of destroying the entire purpose
2015-02-08 15:31:33	@Espyo	so...
2015-02-08 15:31:41	@Espyo	it's neither the right nor the wrong thing to do

2015-02-08 15:35:27	@Espyo	the wikia staff is stubborn

2015-02-08 15:35:45	@Espyo	they want to hold people in, and refuse to let us point out an alternative

2015-02-08 15:41:30	Kirbyddd	I wanted to keep it acceptable while maintaining a partnership with Pikipedia.  The message would tell people about the community and information over here, but wouldn't drive them away from the Pikmin Wiki, hopefully keeping Wikia happy.  Plus, people who are just reading won't affect the community or anything else, really, since they aren't interacting.
2015-02-08 15:42:16	@Espyo	you hosting the wiki wouldn't make a difference for wikia
2015-02-08 15:42:20	@Espyo	they would remove the note
2015-02-08 15:42:32	@Espyo	I don't know if you read the backstory, but we did have a warning up on the main page
2015-02-08 15:42:37	@Espyo	they forced us to remove it before long
2015-02-08 15:42:53	@Espyo	you have to understand Kirby, wikia does not care about the communities or the wikis
2015-02-08 15:42:56	@Espyo	it cares only about market share
2015-02-08 15:43:06	@Espyo	if something is stopping people from entering wikia, they will remove it

2015-02-08 15:43:26	@Espyo	they don't care for the best interest of the community, the reader's information, nothing

2015-02-08 15:43:51	@Espyo	by having people even open up a wikia page, it increases wikia's popularity

2015-02-08 15:44:54	@Espyo	just having people visit wikia more makes it more popular, which makes more people visit it, and it's an endless cycle

2015-02-08 15:45:22	@Espyo	plus, your solution to maintain the Pikmin wikia and become the new owner would just create a new community
2015-02-08 15:45:30	@Espyo	unless you wanted to control the wikia alone

2015-02-08 15:49:26	Kirbyddd	Right, but Pikipedia and the Pikmin Wiki would always be the top two.  I don't want to "own" the Pikmin Wiki or run it alone.  There are plenty of people helping out right now who don't make blog posts or comments.  The one that kept asking for feedback didn't know about Pikipedia so I told him.  Wikia hasn't messed with my front-page note since I put it up,
2015-02-08 15:49:50	Kirbyddd	altough I don't know if that's because they haven't checked the wiki recently.

2015-02-08 15:52:06	@Espyo	and Kirby, wikia will eventually notice the notice
2015-02-08 15:52:18	@Espyo	they did before, when we were doing impulsive things during the merge
2015-02-08 15:52:31	@Espyo	like putting up a similar notice before any discussion with them even happened
2015-02-08 15:52:37	UltraMario	kirby wikia is cool
2015-02-08 15:52:45	@Espyo	I'd guess they do random checkups
2015-02-08 15:52:52	@Espyo	well, but we're not on about the Kirby wikia
2015-02-08 15:53:05	UltraMario	wikirby on the other hand is full of stubs and red links.
2015-02-08 15:53:05	UltraMario	yeah i know :P
2015-02-08 15:53:17	@Espyo	because they had few supporters

Wikia won't let their wiki be taken down, and I'm not the kind of person who would let a noter wiki that I was part of go to ruin.  I've been trying a different tactic than Pikipedia: I tell people about Pikipedia, but don't try to force them to leave.  If I tell them that both wikis have the information,

2015-02-08 16:03:50	@Espyo	that's just it, Pikipedia doesn't quite have the communtiy
2015-02-08 16:03:53	@Espyo	we're trying to
2015-02-08 16:04:00	@Espyo	but with people not making the definite move, it won't happen
2015-02-08 16:04:17	@Espyo	also, you still keep the idea that Pikmin Wiki is the place you grew up with, and Pikipedia isn't
2015-02-08 16:04:22	@Espyo	Pikipedia is Pikmin Wiki
2015-02-08 16:04:24	@Espyo	we've merged
2015-02-08 16:04:57	@Espyo	you telling wikia that it's in upkeep (whether you keep it in upkeep or not) won't make a difference to them keeping a warning up or not
2015-02-08 16:05:13	@Espyo	we've had a warning when we moved out the first time, we've had a warning when we moved out the second time, and they kept removing it
2015-02-08 16:06:47	Testyo	I was ok
2015-02-08 16:07:05	Kirbyddd	"Umm... this wiki has moved.  Go to Pikipedia" isn't the most warm way to let people know.  I haven't seen anyone except a few new users talking.  And yes I know we're the same wiki.
2015-02-08 16:07:26	@Espyo	how is it not the most warm way?
2015-02-08 16:07:35	@Espyo	we've got the information and the community over at Pikipedia
2015-02-08 16:07:40	@Espyo	people are doing nothing by staying at wikia
2015-02-08 16:07:43	@Espyo	we're just informing them
2015-02-08 16:08:03	@Espyo	only way to be warmer would be to add some exclamation marks to not sound so "corporate business"-y
2015-02-08 16:10:38	Kirbyddd	It is telling people to leave, not informing them.  Of course wikia didn't like it.  My message says "The Pikmin Wiki has merged with Pikipedia, a NIWA wiki. Go here to create an account and help! The Pikmin Wiki will remain functional but not much new content is needed."  It might have to be changed later if wikis is still unhappy with it, but it is a lot

2015-02-08 16:11:21	Kirbyddd	more informative than the previous one.  It doesn't make people feel like they have to leave.
2015-02-08 16:11:29	@Espyo	for the most part, people just do a google search for the topic they want and access the result they find
2015-02-08 16:11:32	@Espyo	bypassing the front page
2015-02-08 16:12:01	@Espyo	secondly, implying this would work, and people would finally stop going on wikia, and everybody would be happy on Pikipedia...
2015-02-08 16:12:03	Kirbyddd	I always search the overall title and add wiki.
2015-02-08 16:12:10	@Espyo	what would be the point of you keeping the wikia clean?
2015-02-08 16:12:23	@Espyo	so do I, when I don't know what wikis exist for the topic I want
2015-02-08 16:13:13	Kirbyddd	I'm not that kind of person.  It only takes a few minutes a day, or every other day.
2015-02-08 16:13:30	Kirbyddd	It's not very active.
2015-02-08 16:14:46	Kirbyddd	And with the message, new users would know to come here for something more active.
2015-02-08 16:14:51	@Espyo	not what kind of person?
2015-02-08 16:15:07	Kirbyddd	I don't like to let things go to waste.

2015-02-08 16:17:59	@Espyo	are you a hoarder?
2015-02-08 16:18:30	Kirbyddd	In RPGs.  Let's not stoop to insults.
2015-02-08 16:19:40	@Espyo	I wasn't going to
2015-02-08 16:19:48	@Espyo	people shouldn't be using hoarder as an insult
2015-02-08 16:19:51	@Espyo	anyway, this isn't an RPG
2015-02-08 16:20:12	Kirbyddd	It's information.
2015-02-08 16:20:27	@Espyo	precisely
2015-02-08 16:20:32	@Espyo	it is in no way going to waste
2015-02-08 16:20:40	@Espyo	if the wikia were to be deleted right now, it wouldn't go to waste
2015-02-08 16:20:45	@Espyo	as the information is entirely on Pikipedia
2015-02-08 16:21:46	Kirbyddd	Right, but it would be going to waste if the Pikmin Wiki were in ruins.
2015-02-08 16:22:00	Kirbyddd	It's discouraging.
2015-02-08 16:23:11	@Espyo	how would it?
2015-02-08 16:23:13	@Espyo	it's the same concept
2015-02-08 16:23:17	@Espyo	the information is at Pikipedia
2015-02-08 16:23:27	@Espyo	whether the wikia is vandalized, deleted, etc.
2015-02-08 16:23:42	@Espyo	and how is it discouraging to have the actual community fight for independence?
2015-02-08 16:26:29	Kirbyddd	The community has independence.  It's here.  So there's no point in letting the Pikmin Wiki go to waste.  Nobody there is talking or conspiring.  We're all dedicated to keeping the place presentable.  Trying to keep people from fixing vandalism is no better than doing the vandalism.
2015-02-08 16:28:55	@Espyo	that's just it, the community is not entirely here
2015-02-08 16:28:57	@Espyo	I said that already
2015-02-08 16:29:04	@Espyo	we're trying to have everybody come to Pikipedia only
2015-02-08 16:29:09	@Espyo	loads of people still go on wikia
2015-02-08 16:32:46	Kirbyddd	But to read.  That won't harm Pikipedia.  If a couple thousand people suddenly appeared right now and went on the Pikmin Wiki just to read, the worst it could do is push Pikipedia below it on the search page.  And if that caused a few people to join afterwards, they would have a message sent to them telling them about Pikipedia.  There are not enough people
2015-02-08 16:32:50	Kirbyddd	to do that.
2015-02-08 16:33:09	Kirbyddd	And those who don't just read are keeping the place running.
2015-02-08 16:33:48	@Espyo	"those who don't just read"
2015-02-08 16:33:52	@Espyo	I'm not getting this one, can you rephrase?
2015-02-08 16:35:39	Kirbyddd	Some people just read.  Some people also edit.  The people with an active editing account are only keeping the place running.
2015-02-08 16:36:02	@Espyo	on where? Pikipedia or the wikia?
2015-02-08 16:36:28	Kirbyddd	Wikia.
2015-02-08 16:37:25	@Espyo	well, yeah, but we don't really want people to just keep the place running
2015-02-08 16:37:29	@Espyo	we want people to come to Pikipedia instead
2015-02-08 16:39:08	Kirbyddd	That's not the point of a wiki.  There shouldn't be competition, as long as people get their information its all good.  If people want a community, they can come to Pikipedia.  Competition is what created this mess.

2015-02-08 16:53:01	@Espyo	that's what we thought before
2015-02-08 16:53:05	@Espyo	and look what happened
2015-02-08 16:56:49	Kirbyddd	The community here was small and the Pikmin Wiki was full of inactive users waiting to return.  The Pikmin wiki Community remained mostly active after Pikmin 3, and now Pikipedia has them.  There's now only a very small amount of "sleeping" Pikmin Wiki users and again, new users would not be a huge problem.

2015-02-08 16:59:11	@Espyo	and you must think that the Pikipedia community is huge

2015-02-08 17:15:42	@Espyo	shouldn't interfere, though
2015-02-08 17:16:34	Kirbyddd	Ok.
2015-02-08 17:16:41	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Tropical Forest Remix by Piktoad (+353 /* Gallery */Add two screenshots of the level.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Tropical_Forest_Remix&curid=16388&diff=144678&oldid=143345
2015-02-08 17:16:46	Yoshi2	seems like both wikis are pretty evenly tied, to say the least
2015-02-08 17:17:34	Kirbyddd	Hmm.
2015-02-08 17:18:02	@Espyo	give-or-take
2015-02-08 17:18:18	@Espyo	now we just have to strive to have Pikipedia show up first at all times
2015-02-08 17:18:22	@Espyo	or... well, mostly all
2015-02-08 17:18:30	@Espyo	stuff like "Pikmin" would always give Nintendo and Wikipedia first
2015-02-08 17:20:18	Kirbyddd	If all users left the Pikmin Wiki, a new game would still cause an uprising in users.  I would say it would be even bigger with nobody to direct them.
2015-02-08 17:23:47	@Espyo	yes, but all this is implying wikia will let you direct them

2015-02-08 17:28:19	Kirbyddd	Not again.
2015-02-08 17:28:24	Kirbyddd	Crashed
2015-02-08 17:28:30	Kirbyddd	Just one second
2015-02-08 17:28:53	@Espyo	no worries
2015-02-08 17:31:56	Kirbyddd	Hopefully.  I was in the middle of the adoption process when my computer broke.  After it broke, I couldn't edit as often and I haven't talked to them in a while, so my chances at adopting are much lower.  But if I am able to I think I will have a better chance at explaining to them.  Jpmrocks had a hard time because he was so bitter.
2015-02-08 17:33:13	@Espyo	because none of them want to have the past happen to them again
2015-02-08 17:34:09	Kirbyddd	Wikia or Jpmrocks?
2015-02-08 17:34:35	@Espyo	Jpm + the rest of the cast
2015-02-08 17:35:08	Kirbyddd	Right.
2015-02-08 17:35:25	Kirbyddd	But being bitter will make the job a lot harder.

2015-02-08 17:37:40	Kirbyddd	I think I'll have an easier time if I explain to them without acting angry.  You never know...

2015-02-08 17:50:09	Kirbyddd	Is J needed?
2015-02-08 17:52:21	@Espyo	he can help me decide
2015-02-08 17:52:26	@Espyo	he IS an important member
2015-02-08 17:53:29	Kirbyddd	Whatever you say...
2015-02-08 17:53:59	@Espyo	you can come back later, if you want
2015-02-08 17:54:06	@Espyo	or I guess I can just answer you on the wikia thread
2015-02-08 17:55:15	Kirbyddd	I guess I'll check back later.  If you're not both here you can answer on the thread.
2015-02-08 17:55:29	@Espyo	okay
2015-02-08 17:55:30	@Espyo	see ya

2015-02-08 17:58:37	Yoshi2	I blame J for this discussion having no conclusion
2015-02-08 18:01:43	@Espyo	yes
2015-02-08 18:04:14	@J	oh hi, I still exist
2015-02-08 18:04:20	@J	I went to do some juggling
2015-02-08 18:04:44	@J	you should've said he should hang out here in future anyway
2015-02-08 18:06:21	@Espyo	eh, I suppose he knows
2015-02-08 18:06:33	Yoshi2	I don't think telling him that would change much
2015-02-08 18:07:30	Yoshi2	if there is a need to discuss stuff again, I'm sure he will return
2015-02-08 18:07:41	@J	I just mean to be friendly
