2015-11-19 23:17:22	@Espyo	a Wii U game will likely freeze
2015-11-19 23:17:26	@Espyo	worst damage it can do is to your ears
2015-11-19 23:17:28	Scruffy	But it would be alright afterwards, right?
2015-11-19 23:17:29	@Espyo	BZZZZZZZZZTTT
2015-11-19 23:17:30	@Espyo	yep
2015-11-19 23:17:34	Yoyo	So a null Pikmin will be sent to the onion. But that would mean 101 Pikmin would be on the field because of the null Pikmin.
2015-11-19 23:17:38	Scruffy	Then its settled
2015-11-19 23:17:44	Scruffy	i'll do it
2015-11-19 23:17:44	@Espyo	or that, yeah
2015-11-19 23:17:49	@Espyo	or the game itself has a safeguard
2015-11-19 23:17:54	@Espyo	and if the Pikmin is null, it just skips
2015-11-19 23:17:58	@Espyo	meaning it sends NOTHING to the Onion
2015-11-19 23:18:00	@Espyo	meaning 101 Pikmin
2015-11-19 23:18:06	Scruffy	And I'll take the opportunity to photograph what happens when you get too close to a crystal wall
2015-11-19 23:18:19	@Espyo	but yeah, to brick a console..
2015-11-19 23:18:20	@Espyo	*.
2015-11-19 23:18:27	@Espyo	a bug would have to...
2015-11-19 23:18:30	@Espyo	well, mess with system things
2015-11-19 23:18:37	@Espyo	I don't think any game really can touch system things
2015-11-19 23:18:39	@Espyo	but the closest is the save file
2015-11-19 23:18:49	@Espyo	the game has literally no reason to touch the save file during the whole day
2015-11-19 23:18:58	@Espyo	much less during the process where it decides which Pikmin to chose
2015-11-19 23:18:59	Yoyo	I don't think it will set a limit after that, since Nintendo never expected you to do that.
2015-11-19 23:19:10	@Espyo	only other way to do harm to a console is for the game to get stuck in an infinite loop
2015-11-19 23:19:14	Scruffy	Yeah, if it encountered a problem it wouldn't save it
2015-11-19 23:19:21	@Espyo	...in which the only harm is the game using 100% of the console's power
2015-11-19 23:19:25	@Espyo	...which makes the console a BIT hot
2015-11-19 23:19:29	@Espyo	which means it could melt in 200 years
2015-11-19 23:19:33	Scruffy	Heh
2015-11-19 23:19:55	@Espyo	so yeah, there is no risk
2015-11-19 23:20:07	@Espyo	it'll either loop around the list of Pikmin over and over
2015-11-19 23:20:15	@Espyo	or it'll send a NULL Pikmin to the Onion and crash
2015-11-19 23:20:20	@Espyo	either way, it'll only freeze
2015-11-19 23:20:26	Yoyo	But only for one in-game day. So after the day ends the glitch will correct itself.
2015-11-19 23:20:27	@Espyo	unless the Wii U hates freezing, everything should be perfect
2015-11-19 23:20:33	@Espyo	well, the day can't end
2015-11-19 23:20:36	@Espyo	since the game froze
2015-11-19 23:20:48	@Espyo	ok, I just made a quick test
2015-11-19 23:20:48	Scruffy	But it's time to figure out what actually happens
2015-11-19 23:21:05	@Espyo	threw a Yellow with a bomb at a web
2015-11-19 23:21:13	Yoyo	I feel like we're not the first ones to do this.
2015-11-19 23:21:32	@Espyo	I had enough time to whistle the Yellow after it dropped out of the web (it never gets caught), throw it, and it had enough time to land and still have like 1 second free
2015-11-19 23:21:36	@Espyo	more than enough time to grab a pellet
2015-11-19 23:21:37	@Espyo	but you have to hurry
2015-11-19 23:21:51	@Espyo	what makes you say that, Yoyo?
2015-11-19 23:22:05	@Espyo	I mean, I know quality control departments can be INSANE
2015-11-19 23:22:14	@Espyo	my company's QC department comes up with the absolute craziest scenarios

2015-11-19 23:22:20	@Espyo	wouldn't be surprised if somebody came up with this already
2015-11-19 23:22:38	@Espyo	but that doesn't guarantee that the game will handle the glitch well
2015-11-19 23:22:43	@Espyo	it could've been caught in QC
2015-11-19 23:22:57	@Espyo	but decided by the dev team that it would be too lengthy to fix a problem that's so unlikely
2015-11-19 23:23:02	Yoyo	This is the internet. You're never the first to do something.
2015-11-19 23:23:05	@Espyo	so a known problem could've made its way into the game

2015-11-19 23:23:35	@PikFan	I disconnected unexpectedly
2015-11-19 23:23:41	@Espyo	Scruffy: new file? or are you going to throw away your current file to return to the day of the Twilight River?
2015-11-19 23:23:50	@Espyo	not much, PikFan
2015-11-19 23:23:56	@Espyo	we were discussing if the game could explode
2015-11-19 23:23:58	@Espyo	it couldn't
2015-11-19 23:24:03	@Espyo	it'd probably freeze like...

2015-11-19 23:24:26	Scruffy	It's my current file
2015-11-19 23:24:45	Scruffy	It was already restarted up to the first day with Captain Charlie back
2015-11-19 23:24:51	@Espyo	oh
2015-11-19 23:24:55	@Espyo	well, that's easy then
2015-11-19 23:24:56	Scruffy	So I'll get there soon
2015-11-19 23:25:01	@Espyo	yeah, convenient
2015-11-19 23:25:02	Scruffy	Yeah, I can get there in a day
2015-11-19 23:25:17	Yoyo	Speedrun that *moo*!
2015-11-19 23:25:33	@PikFan	question, why do you like saying moo?
2015-11-19 23:25:39	@Espyo	even if you were to grab your save file from the Plasm Wraith and revert all the way to the Twilight River... you could still redo your work to the Plasm Wraith after the science is over, and it probably wouldn't take long
2015-11-19 23:25:45	@Espyo	so honestly, it's not that much of a painful thing
2015-11-19 23:25:51	@Espyo	but still, really useful that you have a save file so close, anyway
2015-11-19 23:25:56	Yoyo	It's my censor word for cursing.
2015-11-19 23:25:58	@Espyo	can you record your adventure?
2015-11-19 23:26:04	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-19 23:26:10	Scruffy	Umm
2015-11-19 23:26:17	Scruffy	I don't know how to record Wii U game footage
2015-11-19 23:26:23	@Espyo	damn
2015-11-19 23:26:29	@PikFan	aww
2015-11-19 23:26:33	@Espyo	well, it's probably a freeze
2015-11-19 23:26:37	@PikFan	well, that's too bad
2015-11-19 23:26:38	@Espyo	but just in the insane case it isn't
2015-11-19 23:26:41	@Espyo	maybe it'd be nice to have footage
2015-11-19 23:26:43	@Espyo	but we can decide later
2015-11-19 23:26:45	Scruffy	But I could take a screenshot at the opportune moment, if it allows me
2015-11-19 23:26:52	@Espyo	after you get 99 Pikmin, try ending the day
2015-11-19 23:27:01	@PikFan	alrighty, I gotta go now

2015-11-19 23:27:10	Yoyo	You could record the tv and game pad with different equipment.
2015-11-19 23:27:12	Scruffy	Right, okay
2015-11-19 23:27:13	@Espyo	so that you have one day dedicated entirely to doing the bomb rock
2015-11-19 23:27:18	Yoyo	See ya!
2015-11-19 23:27:23	@Espyo	that way if you want to recreate the glitch, you just go back to that day, get the bomb, and go to town
2015-11-19 23:27:25	@Espyo	see ya yoyo
2015-11-19 23:27:31	@Espyo	oh, you meant PikFan
2015-11-19 23:27:33	@Espyo	hurr, sorry
2015-11-19 23:27:48	Scruffy	Good thinking Espyo
2015-11-19 23:28:19	@Espyo	well, provided you have enough fruit to last that long...
2015-11-19 23:28:22	Yoyo	You might want to create a back-up.
2015-11-19 23:28:34	@Espyo	you can't create backups in Pikmin 3
2015-11-19 23:28:36	@Espyo	that's the big issue
2015-11-19 23:28:54	Yoyo	Back up your Wii U dummy!
2015-11-19 23:29:20	@Espyo	 3D print an exact replica, eh?
2015-11-19 23:29:32	Scruffy	Now there's an idea
2015-11-19 23:29:43	@Espyo	well, to sum up the plan...
2015-11-19 23:29:50	@Espyo	a) reach the first day of the Twilight River
2015-11-19 23:30:01	@Espyo	b) open the bridge to the pink Onion
2015-11-19 23:30:18	@Espyo	c) deliver objects so that you get Pikmin seeds in base
2015-11-19 23:30:19	Yoyo	Hook your Wii U to your computer and create a back-up of the Wii U data before you perform the glitch.
2015-11-19 23:30:32	@Espyo	d) repeat until you have 99

2015-11-19 23:30:54	@Espyo	e) grab bomb rock using a Yellow Pikmin and the bombs on the tin can (only Yellows reach, right?)
2015-11-19 23:31:05	@Espyo	wait, actually
2015-11-19 23:31:06	Scruffy	only Yellows reach, yes
2015-11-19 23:31:13	@Espyo	e) go take down the Pellet Posy near the winged Onion
2015-11-19 23:31:15	Yoyo	And wings.
2015-11-19 23:31:22	@Espyo	f) grab a bomb rock
2015-11-19 23:31:31	@Espyo	g) throw the Pikmin at the web
2015-11-19 23:31:38	@Espyo	h) quickly get the Pikmin and throw it on the pellet
2015-11-19 23:31:40	@Espyo	and... kaboom

2015-11-19 23:33:35	@Espyo	depends on a lot of things
2015-11-19 23:33:43	@Espyo	how many Pikmin you can spawn per day
2015-11-19 23:33:48	@Espyo	how quickly enemies respawn

2015-11-19 23:34:30	@Espyo	going through areas and collecting fruits as quickly as possible
2015-11-19 23:34:31	Scruffy	Right now I've just built the path to the Meerslug

2015-11-20 00:07:22	Scruffy	Huh weird
2015-11-20 00:07:36	Scruffy	If you haven't saved the Pink Onion, even if you build the bridge
2015-11-20 00:07:49	Scruffy	Pikmin won't know where to go with the pink pellet
2015-11-20 00:07:54	Scruffy	Beside it
2015-11-20 00:08:45	@Espyo	huh?
2015-11-20 00:08:49	@Espyo	but
2015-11-20 00:09:05	@Espyo	the Pikmin don't care about the pellet's type
2015-11-20 00:09:14	Scruffy	I know
2015-11-20 00:09:14	@Espyo	they just take it to the Onion to make more of the majority's type
2015-11-20 00:09:16	@Espyo	as usual
2015-11-20 00:09:23	Scruffy	that's what's weird
2015-11-20 00:09:23	@Espyo	so what about the pink pellet makes them confused?
2015-11-20 00:09:34	@Espyo	well, what about a nearby Desiccated Skitter Leaf?
2015-11-20 00:09:43	Scruffy	THey'll take that
2015-11-20 00:09:46	@Espyo	right
2015-11-20 00:09:56	@Espyo	does the Pikmin just walk in a circle?
2015-11-20 00:09:59	Scruffy	Yep
2015-11-20 00:10:03	Scruffy	No matter which type
2015-11-20 00:10:04	@Espyo	like it's waiting for a gate in front of it to be cleared?
2015-11-20 00:10:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-20 00:11:12	@Espyo	wow
2015-11-20 00:11:14	@Espyo	well, guess it makes sense
2015-11-20 00:11:25	@Espyo	so the players don't bring precious new-Pikmin-farming materials away and waste them

2015-11-20 00:13:29	@Espyo	supposedly, only the pellets near the Onions work
2015-11-20 00:13:38	@Espyo	because they're meant to be the immediate army-building tools

2015-11-20 00:41:42	En_Passant	Actually, hmm

2015-11-20 00:42:10	Scruffy	Ok I'm gonna have the Yellow Pikmin bomb the Arachnode then pick up the Desiccated Skitter leaf
2015-11-20 00:42:17	Scruffy	I got the leaf as close as I could
2015-11-20 00:43:19	En_Passant	Does Twilight River have any dirt mounds?
2015-11-20 00:43:25	CraftedPbody	Yes
2015-11-20 00:44:02	CraftedPbody	There's one by the base on the trail that leads to the area with the two dwarf orange bulborbs.
2015-11-20 00:44:11	Scruffy	I'll try that next
2015-11-20 00:44:18	Scruffy	Same confirmation as PikFan
2015-11-20 00:44:19	@PikFan	it's not close enough
2015-11-20 00:44:22	@PikFan	that's the problem
2015-11-20 00:44:22	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-20 00:44:34	En_Passant	You have three captains
2015-11-20 00:44:41	CraftedPbody	It contains 3 single Pellets
2015-11-20 00:44:42	@PikFan	right
2015-11-20 00:44:59	@PikFan	but you have 99 buried Pikmin, and 1 bomb rock carrying Yellow Pikmin
2015-11-20 00:45:02	Scruffy	as soon as I looked at the leaf where the Yellow Pikmin should have been, it disappeared
2015-11-20 00:45:10	@PikFan	yeah, same here
2015-11-20 00:45:18	Scruffy	And the leaf fell
2015-11-20 00:45:20	@PikFan	except with the pellet
2015-11-20 00:45:23	Scruffy	making the little noise
2015-11-20 00:46:24	En_Passant	There should be plenty of time to have the Pikmin enter the mound and blow up the Arachnode
2015-11-20 00:47:01	@PikFan	there isn't
2015-11-20 00:47:16	@PikFan	as soon as the bomb rock hits the Arachnode's web, it detonates
2015-11-20 00:47:25	@PikFan	not detonate
2015-11-20 00:47:45	En_Passant	That's why you send them into the dirt mound first
2015-11-20 00:47:45	@PikFan	it activates, I mean
2015-11-20 00:48:01	En_Passant	Then switch Captains and get to work immediately
2015-11-20 00:48:06	En_Passant	*leaders
2015-11-20 00:48:11	Scruffy	Yeah, the Pikmin will be in the dirt mound while the bomb explodes

2015-11-20 00:48:23	@PikFan	there's no way you could get it there in time
2015-11-20 00:48:28	En_Passant	Switch leaders
2015-11-20 00:48:36	@PikFan	won't work
2015-11-20 00:48:44	@PikFan	because you've only got 1 free Pikmin

2015-11-20 00:49:18	@PikFan	16:48	PikFan	there's no way you could get it there in time
2015-11-20 00:49:22	En_Passant	Have the Yellow with the bomb be with one leader near the Onion
2015-11-20 00:49:32	En_Passant	And the other 99 with the other captain at the dirt mound
2015-11-20 00:49:44	@PikFan	no, the other 99 are buried

2015-11-20 18:50:05	Scruffy	You may have seen our results
2015-11-20 18:52:04	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-20 18:52:18	@Espyo	yeah... carrier Pikmin don't get picked, unless they really have to
2015-11-20 18:52:19	@Espyo	that's
2015-11-20 18:52:21	@Espyo	incredible
2015-11-20 18:52:25	@Espyo	but not entirely convincing
2015-11-20 18:52:33	@Espyo	you made the Pikmin carry the pink pellet near the pink Onion, right?
2015-11-20 18:52:37	@Espyo	which you said makes the Pikmin go in circles...
2015-11-20 18:52:43	Scruffy	Well, PikFan tried that
2015-11-20 18:52:49	@Espyo	huh? PikFan?
2015-11-20 18:52:59	@Espyo	so he did the Twilight River 99 seeds 1 carrier thing?
2015-11-20 18:53:15	Scruffy	Yes, he had 99 buried pikmin, yellow bombed the Arachnode, and then started carrying pink pellet
2015-11-20 18:53:21	Scruffy	It sent back the one yellow carrier
2015-11-20 18:53:49	Scruffy	Then I tried it with 99 Pikmin, one Yellow pikmin bombed the arachnode, then started carrying the dessiccated skitter leaf
2015-11-20 18:53:59	Scruffy	timing was very difficult because they're far apart
2015-11-20 18:54:01	@Espyo	I thought YOU were doing that...
2015-11-20 18:54:09	@Espyo	oh, you both tried
2015-11-20 18:54:10	@Espyo	I see
2015-11-20 18:54:25	Scruffy	but I learned to move the skitter leaf closer to the onion using leaders
2015-11-20 18:54:27	Yoshi2	what are you trying to do?
2015-11-20 18:54:34	@Espyo	heh, I was going to suggest that
2015-11-20 18:54:48	Scruffy	See how the game chooses what Pikmin to send back if 100 are in the field when an Onion is discovered
2015-11-20 18:55:08	@Espyo	can you test some more?
2015-11-20 18:55:12	Scruffy	with 99 buried Pikmin and a yellow pikmin carrying the skitter leaf, that yellow pikmin is still put back
2015-11-20 18:55:34	Scruffy	Then I tried with 99 buried Pikmin, yellow bombs arachnode, and then gets thrown in the water and starts drowning
2015-11-20 18:55:58	Scruffy	Since Pikmin don't disappear during the cutscene, you heard the drowning noise sustained until the very moment the Pink seed appeared
2015-11-20 18:56:33	Scruffy	Then I tried it with 99 buried /Rock/ Pikmin
2015-11-20 18:56:45	Scruffy	And I used the Dodge Whistle to have a 100th rock Pikmin grab a bomb
2015-11-20 18:57:01	Scruffy	Still the only non-buried rock pikmin was sent back
2015-11-20 18:57:48	Scruffy	I have yet to see if, out of multiple working Pikmin, which one will be sent back
2015-11-20 18:58:00	Scruffy	But I think it'd end up being whoever's closest
2015-11-20 18:58:05	Scruffy	to the master Onion
2015-11-20 18:58:45	Scruffy	But I found something unusual after that
2015-11-20 18:58:47	Scruffy	And I got a photo
2015-11-20 18:58:52	Scruffy	Photos*
2015-11-20 18:59:08	Scruffy	The web that holds the Winged Onion is not like other Arachnode webs
2015-11-20 18:59:39	Scruffy	I wanted to see if leaders by themselves could harm the Arachnode in any way, by getting it as close to the ground as it could
2015-11-20 18:59:45	Scruffy	It went farther than I thought
2015-11-20 18:59:59	Scruffy	In fact the Arachnode can crawl outside the area of the web
2015-11-20 19:00:16	Scruffy	it crawled beneath the web
2015-11-20 19:00:22	Scruffy	But still not low enough for me to hit it
2015-11-20 19:00:39	Scruffy	And even if I could, I couldn't have 100 buried Pikmin in the field
2015-11-20 19:00:49	Scruffy	But then something even stranger
2015-11-20 19:01:00	Scruffy	When leaders are thrown into this web, they become stuck
2015-11-20 19:01:12	Scruffy	But their geometry is squashed in one direction
2015-11-20 19:01:33	Scruffy	At one point the Arachnode bit Brittany and she became 2-dimensional
2015-11-20 19:01:40	Scruffy	I'll upload a photo
2015-11-20 19:01:57	Yoshi2	interesting
2015-11-20 19:02:43	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-20 19:07:09	@Espyo	yeah, I was going to ask
2015-11-20 19:07:13	@Espyo	what about 98 seeds and 2 workers?
2015-11-20 19:07:17	@Espyo	likely the farthest, though
2015-11-20 19:07:23	@Espyo	it's always the farthest in normal scenarios
2015-11-20 19:07:32	@Espyo	<Scruffy> I wanted to see if leaders by themselves could harm the Arachnode in any way, by getting it as close to the ground as it could
2015-11-20 19:07:35	@Espyo	I was just thinking this
2015-11-20 19:07:54	@Espyo	lolwut?
2015-11-20 19:07:55	@Espyo	 2D?
2015-11-20 19:07:56	@Espyo	that's awesome
2015-11-20 19:08:06	@Espyo	anyway, think you can add these findings to the talk page?
2015-11-20 19:08:09	@Espyo	even though they're on the wiki
2015-11-20 19:08:17	@Espyo	thing is, these are so rare and hard to find
2015-11-20 19:08:24	@Espyo	well, hard to conclude
2015-11-20 19:08:28	@Espyo	that people might think we're making it up
2015-11-20 19:08:36	@Espyo	although we have no real proof other than us saying we did it
2015-11-20 19:08:38	@Espyo	it's better than something
2015-11-20 19:08:42	@Espyo	I'll use the talk page as a source
2015-11-20 19:08:45	@Espyo	like an informal book
2015-11-20 19:08:56	@Espyo	well, I'll also make a video for the first game, but besides that, all we have is the talk page
2015-11-20 19:12:27	Scruffy	Just uploaded the file

2015-11-20 19:12:51	Scruffy	Yikes indeed
2015-11-20 19:13:31	@Espyo	where is--
2015-11-20 19:13:33	@Espyo	GEEZ
2015-11-20 19:13:57	Scruffy	That was the best picture I got of it
2015-11-20 19:14:04	@Espyo	so this happens every time an Arachnode bites a web-bound leader?
2015-11-20 19:14:07	Scruffy	They can be skewed in other directions
2015-11-20 19:14:10	Scruffy	I don't know
2015-11-20 19:14:14	Scruffy	I've only tested this one web
2015-11-20 19:14:24	@Espyo	should be fun
2015-11-20 19:14:29	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2015-11-20 19:14:30	@Espyo	also, you can get higher quality images in other ways
2015-11-20 19:14:34	@Espyo	for one thing, use the TV
2015-11-20 19:14:45	@Espyo	secondly, open the internet browser and go directly to the wiki
2015-11-20 19:14:47	Scruffy	How so?
2015-11-20 19:14:52	@Espyo	or use something like imgur, sta.sh, dropbox, etc.
2015-11-20 19:15:00	@Espyo	that way it saves a full-quality 1080p image
2015-11-20 19:15:04	@Espyo	...or 720p, can't remember which
2015-11-20 19:15:12	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-20 19:15:24	@Espyo	would be useful for shots like these, where it's hard to see
2015-11-20 19:15:29	Scruffy	Yeah, sorry
2015-11-20 19:15:33	@Espyo	no worries!
2015-11-20 19:15:45	@Espyo	it's good enough
2015-11-20 19:15:54	@Espyo	and if we can get better, we'll just replace it
2015-11-20 19:15:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-20 19:16:04	Scruffy	It completely caught me off guard
2015-11-20 19:16:11	@Espyo	that's so goofy
2015-11-20 19:16:15	@Espyo	wonder if it's on purpose
2015-11-20 19:16:19	@Espyo	it has no real reason not to be
2015-11-20 19:16:23	@Espyo	...but it has no real reason to be, either
2015-11-20 19:17:12	Scruffy	It was probably something about their skeletons going weird when hit with the animation to be stuck in a web
2015-11-20 19:17:25	Scruffy	Because that web is constantly shaking with the pink Onion in it
2015-11-20 19:17:36	@Espyo	hmm
2015-11-20 19:18:05	Scruffy	Oh, I also found a bit of behavioral stuff about Yellow Wollywogs
2015-11-20 19:18:27	Scruffy	Since I had time left in the day and those two wollywogs in twilight river
2015-11-20 19:18:51	Scruffy	Without any Pikmin near me, they seemed to only jump once from their normal spots, and then hop back
2015-11-20 19:19:06	Scruffy	Even if I were right next to them, they wouldn't care until they reached home again
2015-11-20 19:19:26	Scruffy	UNLESS
2015-11-20 19:19:36	Scruffy	they hurt the leader on the first jump
2015-11-20 19:19:46	Scruffy	Then they'd jump again
2015-11-20 19:19:54	@Espyo	wow
2015-11-20 19:20:02	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-20 19:20:20	Scruffy	So I could get them to jump up to four times in succession, as long as they hit me every time
2015-11-20 19:20:48	Scruffy	until they get the leader out of their territorial range, or maybe until they reach a point where they are required to return
2015-11-20 19:20:58	Scruffy	And I got one Wollywog to kill the other
2015-11-20 19:21:04	@Espyo	haha!
2015-11-20 19:21:10	@Espyo	gotta add this to the article
2015-11-20 19:21:13	@Espyo	so much science
2015-11-20 19:21:22	Scruffy	Yeah, it's so much fun
2015-11-20 19:21:33	Scruffy	I haven't actually gotten time to play P3 for a while
2015-11-20 19:22:19	@Espyo	I hear ya
2015-11-20 19:23:16	Scruffy	Anyway, I'll add my Onion discovery findings in just a sev

2015-11-20 20:40:43	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2015-11-20 20:43:19	Yoyo	But imagine Peter Capaldi (who plays the twelfth and current doctor) going to Hocotate with the Pikmin to save Hocotate from the DALEKS.
2015-11-20 20:44:50	Scruffy	More test results
2015-11-20 20:45:05	Scruffy	Sorry I was in a hurry when I wrote on the talk page
2015-11-20 20:45:12	Scruffy	I can now go into it in more depth
2015-11-20 20:45:43	Scruffy	If 2 Pikmin are carrying and the rest are buried (type and maturity equal), the farthest one from the master Onion is sent back
2015-11-20 20:46:22	Scruffy	If 1 Pikmin is carrying and 1 is in a dirt mound and the rest are buried (type and maturity equal), the carrier is sent back, not the dirt mound on.
2015-11-20 20:46:25	Scruffy	one.*
2015-11-20 20:46:31	@Espyo	oh, from the Master Onion? how weird
2015-11-20 20:46:56	Scruffy	And a Pikmin that is flying away after a bomb explosion will proceed with dying during the cutscene
2015-11-20 20:47:24	@Espyo	awesome
2015-11-20 20:47:33	Scruffy	Also, the Puffy Blowhog has a 180 degree field of vision
2015-11-20 20:47:33	Testyo	180 degree = 3.14159 rad
2015-11-20 20:48:29	Yoyo	Great.
2015-11-20 20:48:37	Scruffy	And the Dessiccated Skitter Leaf can go substantially farther than its "rest" radius, so if it ever stops outside that radius will "walk" balk to that radius in order to go back to rest
2015-11-20 20:48:41	Scruffy	back*
2015-11-20 20:51:11	Scruffy	I don't know what strange equation determines its movement, but it has a low turning speed and always wants to move away from captains or Pikmin that aren't idle
2015-11-20 20:51:36	@Espyo	that Puffy Blowhog thing might be on the game's files
2015-11-20 20:51:39	@Espyo	like, readily readable
2015-11-20 20:51:50	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-20 20:51:58	@Espyo	I think all of them do
2015-11-20 20:52:04	Scruffy	It's just what appeared to happen, I'm not exactly sure
2015-11-20 20:52:05	@Espyo	at least the ones that make sense
2015-11-20 20:52:10	Scruffy	heh
2015-11-20 20:52:10	@Espyo	so probably not the Quaggled Mireclops
2015-11-20 20:52:17	@Espyo	well, that's a lot of research
2015-11-20 20:52:22	@Espyo	you may want to point it down before you forget this or that
2015-11-20 20:52:54	Scruffy	Oh! Also
2015-11-20 20:53:18	Scruffy	In the event that an Onion is in the process of sucking something up right when the day ends
2015-11-20 20:53:35	Scruffy	The sucking up effect will remain on the Onion during the end of day cutscenes
2015-11-20 20:53:43	Scruffy	Up until its legs suck in
2015-11-20 20:53:46	Yoyo	Sounds so wrong.
2015-11-20 20:54:02	Scruffy	Sorry

2015-11-20 21:52:39	@Espyo	hey, how did you get 98 buried Pikmin, one in a dirt mound, and one carrying
2015-11-20 21:52:47	@Espyo	if there are no dirt mounds in the Twilight River?
2015-11-20 21:54:49	Scruffy	There's one on the path to the two Dwarf Orange Bulborbs
2015-11-20 21:54:58	Scruffy	it contains 3 yellow 1 pellets
2015-11-20 21:55:17	Scruffy	That's the only one, and it doesn't respawn
2015-11-20 21:55:38	@Espyo	oh
2015-11-20 21:55:48	@Espyo	well, in that case there was no real need to use 99 seeds
2015-11-20 21:56:03	@Espyo	you could've just swarmed 99 Pikmin into it and have 1 explosive/carrier
2015-11-20 21:56:09	@Espyo	oh well
2015-11-20 21:56:14	@Espyo	at least now we know with seeds, too
2015-11-20 21:57:17	Scruffy	Oh
2015-11-20 21:57:19	Scruffy	Yeah, that's true
2015-11-20 21:57:32	Scruffy	It was just convenient, I already had 99 Rock Pikmin buried
2015-11-20 21:57:43	Scruffy	or, 98
2015-11-20 21:58:37	@Espyo	are you SURE it's the Pikmin farthest from the Master Onion?
2015-11-20 21:58:51	@Espyo	because I just made a quick simple test with the Blue Onion
2015-11-20 21:58:54	Scruffy	That's what the test told me
2015-11-20 21:59:01	@Espyo	had one Pikmin farthest from the Master Onion than all other Pikmin
2015-11-20 21:59:08	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-20 21:59:15	@Espyo	and had one Pikmin farthest from the blue Onion, but close to the Master Onion
2015-11-20 21:59:19	Scruffy	Two Pikmin, one closer en route to the master Onion than the other
2015-11-20 21:59:26	@Espyo	and the Pikmin farthest from the blue, closest to the master, is the one that got sent
2015-11-20 21:59:26	Scruffy	I haven't tried the blue onion yet
2015-11-20 21:59:49	Scruffy	All my and Pikfan's tests were on the winged onion
2015-11-20 22:00:05	@Espyo	hm
2015-11-20 22:00:35	Scruffy	What I really want to try next is seeing what happens if you discover Rock Pikmin with 100 Pikmin on the field
2015-11-20 22:01:06	Scruffy	Because the 6 rock pikmin are already loaded with the garden of hope, but not counted as part of the field
2015-11-20 22:01:26	Scruffy	Will the Onion stop ejecting seeds at 94 or will 6 Pikmin be taken back when Rock Pikmin are found?
2015-11-20 22:01:48	Scruffy	it requires getting at least 94 red pikmin in 4 days
2015-11-20 22:01:50	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-11-20 22:01:56	@Espyo	probably the same behavior as an Onion, really
2015-11-20 22:02:00	Scruffy	True
2015-11-20 22:02:12	@Espyo	we should add it to the todo
2015-11-20 22:02:20	Scruffy	Anyway, I can't science anymore for the weekend, I'm away from my Wii U
2015-11-20 22:02:25	@Espyo	oh well

2015-11-20 22:02:38	Scruffy	No problem, it was really fun!
2015-11-20 22:02:40	@Espyo	hey, you know how the Pikmin get confused if you try to take away a pink pellet?
2015-11-20 22:02:44	@Espyo	doesn't happen with blue pellets
2015-11-20 22:02:46	@Espyo	just tried
2015-11-20 22:02:50	Scruffy	Hmm
2015-11-20 22:02:57	@Espyo	Winged Pikmin can fetch it out of the water no problem
2015-11-20 22:03:07	Scruffy	They just picked up the pellet and went around in a little circle
2015-11-20 22:03:16	Scruffy	As though something were obstructing their path
2015-11-20 22:03:18	@Espyo	did you get the "the Pikmin seem confused" cutscene?
2015-11-20 22:03:45	Scruffy	Oh, I'm not sure
2015-11-20 22:03:52	Scruffy	I had probably gotten it before in that gaem

2015-11-21 02:23:07	Miles	PAL screwed up 60Hz so you accelerate faster than you should, it's not that important though (aside from when you want to compare times/scores between the versions...)
2015-11-21 02:23:34	Miles	Speedrunning-wise it also fixed a glitch that lets you skip stages in Story Mode

2015-11-21 21:23:30	En_Passant	I can keep this open while playing, right?
2015-11-21 21:23:40	@PikFan	no
2015-11-21 21:23:50	@PikFan	I mean, you can keep the tab open, yeah
2015-11-21 21:23:55	@PikFan	but you won't be able to talk
2015-11-21 21:24:05	@PikFan	and you'll probably have to connect again when you get back on the browser
2015-11-21 21:25:01	@PikFan	also, be warned: if you use another tab for a while, you'll probably disconnect on your chat tab
2015-11-21 21:25:31	En_Passant	I see
2015-11-21 21:25:50	@PikFan	anyway...
2015-11-21 21:25:59	Testyo	PikFan is a flooder!
2015-11-21 21:26:09	@PikFan	Testyo, be quiet
2015-11-21 21:26:32	Testyo	I'd take a guess that the circuits for listening for a bit stupid because it's katakana and most words can mean pretty much anything if you dont know what to look for
2015-11-21 21:26:55	@PikFan	so, in my story, I realized that Sprout Facilities are unnecessary, because Pikmin already know how to fight, etc when they're born
2015-11-21 21:27:38	En_Passant	Sprout Facilities? I don't remember those

2015-11-21 21:28:20	En_Passant	Found the back button
2015-11-21 21:28:24	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-21 21:28:33	@PikFan	yeah, they're found in chapter 1
2015-11-21 21:29:00	@PikFan	instead, I'll just change them to Registration Facilities for chapter 2
2015-11-21 21:29:15	@PikFan	I think it'll be better that way
2015-11-21 21:29:30	En_Passant	What are they registering for?
2015-11-21 21:30:02	@PikFan	for a Pikmin ID, which basically connects them to the Onion
2015-11-21 21:30:28	@PikFan	this ID also lets them have other amenities, too
2015-11-21 21:31:19	En_Passant	Aren't they already tied to their Onion, though?
2015-11-21 21:31:32	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-11-21 21:31:44	@PikFan	but it just strengthens their bond
2015-11-21 21:32:22	@PikFan	wait, no, not ID, it's an Account
2015-11-21 21:32:48	@PikFan	"This device will let you to connect with the spirit of the Onion, which itself is connected to your Account. Each time you do an action, like harvesting a pellet, that action is recorded by the Onion and is entered into your Account. It is like a logbook that way. Also, these actions will earn you Pokos. The things you do with your Pokos are recorded in
2015-11-21 21:33:09	@PikFan	your Account, too."
2015-11-21 21:33:19	En_Passant	Because the Onions can't already monitor Pikmin?
2015-11-21 21:35:52	@PikFan	the purpose of the Account is to let them earn Pokos, which are used to let the Pikmin buy stuff, since their society has evolved to something like that of humans'
2015-11-21 21:36:00	@PikFan	of course, just Pikmin-ified
2015-11-21 21:37:07	@PikFan	I know that Pikmin having an advanced society isn't really fitting given their primitive nature, but eh
2015-11-21 21:37:23	@PikFan	I wanted to put a twist on things
2015-11-21 21:37:39	En_Passant	Are there businesses? What do they spend Pokos on?
2015-11-21 21:37:47	@PikFan	yes, there are
2015-11-21 21:37:58	@PikFan	leisure items, really
2015-11-21 21:38:17	@PikFan	the only food they ever need is Nectar
2015-11-21 21:38:20	@PikFan	*nectar
2015-11-21 21:38:25	@PikFan	not sure why I capitalized that
2015-11-21 21:39:40	@PikFan	oh, since you mentioned businesses, they can also do things at businesses, too
2015-11-21 21:39:57	@PikFan	just what specifically... I'm not sure

2015-11-22 05:06:23	En_Passant	Because P2 was prepared for that
2015-11-22 05:06:33	ScruffyChat	They didn't account for it because it's really hard to get that many red pikmin
2015-11-22 05:06:50	@PikFan	yeah, how can you get that many? you only have 3 days before game over
2015-11-22 05:06:53	ScruffyChat	You have to defeat the two wogpoles on land every day
2015-11-22 05:06:58	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-22 05:07:10	ScruffyChat	And you have to get the sunseed berry for an extra day
2015-11-22 05:07:17	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-11-22 05:07:37	ScruffyChat	I also noticed one flower in the pot by the Dwarf Red Bulborb changes color
2015-11-22 05:07:41	ScruffyChat	From day to day
2015-11-22 05:07:48	@PikFan	odd
2015-11-22 05:07:54	ScruffyChat	One day it's yellow, one day it's blue
2015-11-22 05:08:29	ScruffyChat	And there's a Dandelion near there that eventually becomes a Seeding Dandelion, probably on a random day
2015-11-22 05:08:36	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-22 05:08:44	@PikFan	well, that's a nice touch
2015-11-22 05:08:50	ScruffyChat	The Garden of Hope has so many nice details like that
2015-11-22 05:10:31	ScruffyChat	Anyway, what did I miss before this, if anything?
2015-11-22 05:11:02	@PikFan	you mean from the time when you quit until you came back?
2015-11-22 05:11:13	ScruffyChat	Yes, if you were there
2015-11-22 05:11:17	ScruffyChat	Sorry I had to go
2015-11-22 05:11:29	@PikFan	it's fine, and yeah, I was
2015-11-22 05:12:50	ScruffyChat	Ah ok
2015-11-22 05:13:06	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/zWR46vqC
2015-11-22 05:13:11	@PikFan	all of today's logs
2015-11-22 05:13:34	@PikFan	or, yesterday's, I suppose, since it's past midnight for you
2015-11-22 05:14:19	ScruffyChat	Heh, it's fine
2015-11-22 05:14:50	ScruffyChat	It's just tough surviving with all these nocturnal creatures around
2015-11-22 05:14:59	@PikFan	:D
2015-11-22 05:15:34	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-11-22 05:15:49	@PikFan	I worked on chapter 5 of Mysterious World some more today
2015-11-22 05:15:58	ScruffyChat	Yay!
2015-11-22 05:16:29	@PikFan	it's almost 3K words now
2015-11-22 05:16:35	ScruffyChat	Nice
2015-11-22 05:17:00	ScruffyChat	That's some dedicatoon
2015-11-22 05:17:06	ScruffyChat	Dedication*
2015-11-22 05:17:26	@PikFan	chapter 4 is the longest, clocking in at about 3,500 words
2015-11-22 05:17:32	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-11-22 05:18:15	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/r733uJ5e
2015-11-22 05:18:36	@PikFan	I really, really like the last paragraph
2015-11-22 05:19:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-22 05:20:02	ScruffyChat	I love the word "dappled"
2015-11-22 05:20:30	@PikFan	it suddenly popped into my head, and it was the perfect fit
2015-11-22 05:20:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-22 05:21:51	ScruffyChat	Oh wait, are you just pasting the text into the chatroom prompt, and it creates a pastebin page for you?
2015-11-22 05:22:03	@PikFan	no, that one is broken
2015-11-22 05:22:12	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-11-22 05:22:17	@PikFan	I go to the pastebin website
2015-11-22 05:22:24	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-11-22 05:22:28	ScruffyChat	Just curious
2015-11-22 05:22:35	@PikFan	http://mibpaste.com/cLsrr4 
2015-11-22 05:22:41	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-22 05:22:48	@PikFan	well, I guess it's not broken right now
2015-11-22 05:22:59	@PikFan	eh, I still like the normal pastebin better
2015-11-22 05:23:03	ScruffyChat	Still kinda uglu
2015-11-22 05:23:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-22 05:25:12	ScruffyChat	I have to get going
2015-11-22 05:25:16	@PikFan	aww
2015-11-22 05:25:18	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-22 05:25:27	ScruffyChat	Sorry again for the short stays
2015-11-22 05:25:29	ScruffyChat	Wait
2015-11-22 05:25:31	@PikFan	I might be on tomorrow possible
2015-11-22 05:25:33	ScruffyChat	Wait a minute
2015-11-22 05:25:36	@PikFan	?
2015-11-22 05:25:41	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-11-22 05:25:42	ScruffyChat	Nevermind
2015-11-22 05:25:55	ScruffyChat	Sorry, false alarm
2015-11-22 05:26:02	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-22 05:26:19	@PikFan	I hope you get your computer fixed
2015-11-22 05:26:23	ScruffyChat	Me too
2015-11-22 05:26:33	ScruffyChat	Hopefully tomorrow it'll be resolved
2015-11-22 05:26:42	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-22 05:28:17	ScruffyChat	Once I do I'll upload my latest Blender study
2015-11-22 05:28:27	@PikFan	awesome!
2015-11-22 05:28:30	ScruffyChat	I made it just before my computer broke down
2015-11-22 05:28:46	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-22 05:28:54	ScruffyChat	Have you ever heard of/played the game Tearaway?
2015-11-22 05:29:07	@PikFan	no, sorry
2015-11-22 05:29:10	@PikFan	what's it about?
2015-11-22 05:29:17	ScruffyChat	Oh, don't be sorry
2015-11-22 05:29:40	ScruffyChat	It's a 3D platformer that looks and animates like it's all made of construction paper
2015-11-22 05:29:50	ScruffyChat	With a really nice folky soundtrack
2015-11-22 05:30:16	ScruffyChat	It inspired me to create a construction paper awakening wood
2015-11-22 05:30:22	@PikFan	ooh
2015-11-22 05:31:02	ScruffyChat	And once I'm able to transfer the backup somewhere, I'll post it
2015-11-22 05:31:14	@PikFan	sweet
2015-11-22 05:31:26	ScruffyChat	Only on Pikmin Fanon, the forums do not accept such large files
2015-11-22 05:31:45	@PikFan	really? that's too bad
2015-11-22 05:31:52	ScruffyChat	That's another thing I defend for Pikmin Fanon
2015-11-22 05:32:01	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-22 05:32:01	ScruffyChat	It allows big files
2015-11-22 05:32:18	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-22 05:32:29	@PikFan	I wonder why the forums don't allow big files
2015-11-22 05:32:41	@PikFan	processing constraints...?
2015-11-22 05:32:42	ScruffyChat	Well, no bigger than 1 MB
2015-11-22 05:32:49	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-22 05:34:58	ScruffyChat	It's probably processing constraints, so that pages don't take extremely long to load
2015-11-22 05:35:11	@PikFan	mm, yeah
2015-11-22 05:40:45	En_Passant	so
2015-11-22 05:41:20	En_Passant	I was thinking about maybe having a mechanic similar to Twilight River, but with ice instead of lily pads
2015-11-22 05:41:50	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-22 05:42:05	En_Passant	I'm not sure if I should put it in the last area or in Glimmering Ridge, though
2015-11-22 05:42:11	@PikFan	your call
2015-11-22 05:42:24	@PikFan	do both of them have a riveR?
2015-11-22 05:42:31	@PikFan	ugh, I keep capitalizing r...
2015-11-22 05:43:06	En_Passant	I dunno
2015-11-22 05:43:26	En_Passant	The problem is that I don't know what to do for the last area
2015-11-22 05:43:31	En_Passant	Not a lot you can do with snow
2015-11-22 05:44:08	@PikFan	sure there is
2015-11-22 05:44:18	@PikFan	you could have a slope of sorts with snowballs rolling down it
2015-11-22 05:44:27	@PikFan	and they get bigger as they roll down
2015-11-22 05:44:44	En_Passant	Okay, that would probably go in Glimmering Ridge
2015-11-22 05:45:02	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-22 05:45:07	En_Passant	And that doesn't really help with making a theme for an area
2015-11-22 05:45:07	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-22 05:45:43	@PikFan	well, what kind of snow are you thinking
2015-11-22 05:45:44	En_Passant	Like, in Verdant Forest, they're a marshy area, a dense jungle, and a pine forest
2015-11-22 05:45:53	En_Passant	All related, but distinct
2015-11-22 05:46:02	@PikFan	powdery snow, or sticky snow, etc?
2015-11-22 05:47:14	En_Passant	uh
2015-11-22 05:47:24	En_Passant	Does that matter?
2015-11-22 05:47:41	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-22 05:48:03	@PikFan	they have different properties, no?
2015-11-22 05:48:47	En_Passant	Not very different
2015-11-22 05:49:30	En_Passant	And they look the same
2015-11-22 05:49:34	@PikFan	well then, can't you just use other forms of frozen precipitation?
2015-11-22 05:51:10	En_Passant	Do any of them stick to the ground in an identifiable manner?
2015-11-22 05:51:30	@PikFan	freezing rain and hail
2015-11-22 05:52:06	@PikFan	hail can build up and stick, like snow, though it'd be more loose
2015-11-22 05:52:31	@PikFan	and freezing rain would cover the ground and other things in layers of ice
2015-11-22 05:53:01	@PikFan	if those ideas aren't acceptable, then I've got nothing
2015-11-22 06:29:05	En_Passant	I don't think that's the way to think about it
2015-11-22 06:29:31	En_Passant	The setting that the snow is on top of is more important
2015-11-22 06:30:07	@PikFan	that wasn't clear to me
2015-11-22 06:30:15	@PikFan	but alright
2015-11-22 06:33:50	En_Passant	So there's a house
2015-11-22 06:34:01	En_Passant	There's enough snow piled up that you can't really tell
2015-11-22 06:34:10	En_Passant	On top of the house is where the boss roosts
2015-11-22 06:34:53	En_Passant	A nearby street has collected water from melted snow, creating Clear Creek
2015-11-22 06:35:56	En_Passant	Some snow drifts in the vicinity create Glimmering Ridge
2015-11-22 06:36:06	En_Passant	What else can we add?
2015-11-22 06:38:34	@PikFan	well, does the house have to absolutely be hidden?
2015-11-22 06:39:07	--	AFKazooie is now known as Pidgey
2015-11-22 06:39:28	En_Passant	It has to be hidden enough that it gets confused for a mountain's peak
2015-11-22 06:40:10	@PikFan	alright, but that shouldn't preclude exploration of the inside
2015-11-22 06:40:16	En_Passant	Of course
2015-11-22 06:40:30	En_Passant	That will be at least one of the caves
2015-11-22 06:40:35	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-22 06:41:37	En_Passant	I'm thinking of having one be the main floor and the other be the basement/inner workings
2015-11-22 06:42:17	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-22 06:42:45	@PikFan	does the house have to be confused for a mountain?
2015-11-22 06:42:58	@PikFan	as long as it's any big structure, it should be fine
2015-11-22 06:43:20	En_Passant	I guess it doesn't have to be a house
2015-11-22 06:43:32	En_Passant	But a house is probably the most interesting
2015-11-22 06:43:32	@PikFan	that's not what I meant
2015-11-22 06:43:58	@PikFan	I meant that you could have things poking out of the snow that relate to the house in some manner
2015-11-22 06:44:30	En_Passant	What do you mean?
2015-11-22 06:45:14	@PikFan	like, say parts of the house have fallen away and somehow got embedded in the snowdrifts
2015-11-22 06:45:32	@PikFan	bricks, glass, wood, etc
2015-11-22 06:45:58	@PikFan	and they become part of the interactable environment
2015-11-22 06:46:13	@PikFan	obstacles, for instance
2015-11-22 06:46:50	En_Passant	I'm somewhat already doing that? The Fragments are bricks
2015-11-22 06:46:56	En_Passant	But I hadn't really intended it like that
2015-11-22 06:47:05	En_Passant	I guess I could put more emphasis on that
2015-11-22 06:47:15	En_Passant	Maybe one of the neighboring houses has fallen apart
2015-11-22 06:47:29	@PikFan	good idea
2015-11-22 06:47:34	@PikFan	and you could explore its ruins
2015-11-22 06:47:56	@PikFan	well, actually
2015-11-22 06:48:06	En_Passant	I've been thinking about what I can do with the backyard
2015-11-22 06:48:07	@PikFan	er... never mind
2015-11-22 06:48:23	En_Passant	Maybe there's a playground? Or a shed?
2015-11-22 06:48:56	@PikFan	possibly, yes
2015-11-22 06:49:09	@PikFan	hold on, brb
2015-11-22 06:50:08	En_Passant	I've been tossing around a ruins idea for a while now
2015-11-22 06:54:56	@PikFan	back
2015-11-22 06:55:02	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-22 06:55:08	@PikFan	ScruffyChat, you still around?

2015-11-22 14:35:22	@Espyo	hey
2015-11-22 14:35:38	ScruffyChat	So my computer is still on the fritz
2015-11-22 14:36:01	ScruffyChat	I think it may be a hardware problem because it keeps failing to recognize the hard disk
2015-11-22 14:36:15	ScruffyChat	Anyway I'm taking it to the shop today to find out
2015-11-22 14:36:57	ScruffyChat	But I wanted to tell you I was actually able to conduct some science
2015-11-22 14:37:14	ScruffyChat	I just can't put it on Pikipedia yet, because... My computer
2015-11-22 14:37:59	ScruffyChat	I found out that discovering Rock Pikmin is not like discovering an Onion
2015-11-22 14:38:15	@Espyo	yeah, sounds like a hardware problem for sure
2015-11-22 14:38:21	@Espyo	but you can probably replace the hard drive and be good to go
2015-11-22 14:38:33	@Espyo	oh?
2015-11-22 14:38:51	ScruffyChat	yeah, at least everything's backed up
2015-11-22 14:39:29	ScruffyChat	It's more like discovering Blue Pikmin in Pikmin 2, where there are wild Pikmin that prevent the maximum on the field from reaching 100
2015-11-22 14:39:34	ScruffyChat	EXCEPT
2015-11-22 14:40:09	ScruffyChat	The game assumes you won't be able to get 95 or more Red Pikmin before discovering Rock Pikmin
2015-11-22 14:40:43	@Espyo	hah
2015-11-22 14:40:49	ScruffyChat	So if you get 95 or more before Rock Pikmin, it gives you the cutscene with 100 pikmin limit as though you have 100
2015-11-22 14:41:17	ScruffyChat	It doesn't mention wild Pikmin at all
2015-11-22 14:42:16	ScruffyChat	And I'll admit, it's pretty challenging to get 95 Red Pikmin on 4 days of juice in just the Garden of Hope
2015-11-22 14:42:26	@Espyo	I bet
2015-11-22 14:42:27	ScruffyChat	I had to get the two Wogpoles every day
2015-11-22 14:42:34	ScruffyChat	They respawn each day
2015-11-22 14:43:08	@Espyo	so let me get this straight, if you have, say, 94 Pikmin, and you try to birth two more, the second seed will remain inside the Onion, and you'll get the cutscene where they talk about the limit?
2015-11-22 14:43:17	@Espyo	oh, yeah, those
2015-11-22 14:43:44	ScruffyChat	even one more than 94 will trigger the cutscene
2015-11-22 14:44:37	ScruffyChat	I saw the map of the Rock Pikmin ave before discovering Rock Pikmin and the 6 Rock Pikmin are loaded with the cave
2015-11-22 14:44:54	ScruffyChat	They'll do anything to keep you from having more than 100
2015-11-22 14:45:48	@Espyo	<ScruffyChat> I saw the map of the Rock Pikmin ave before discovering Rock Pikmin and the 6 Rock Pikmin are loaded with the cave
2015-11-22 14:45:54	@Espyo	I think you butchered something while writing that
2015-11-22 14:47:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-22 14:47:53	ScruffyChat	I meant I could see the map of the Rock Pikmin /cave/
2015-11-22 14:47:58	ScruffyChat	Before going there
2015-11-22 14:48:01	@Espyo	ah
2015-11-22 14:48:26	@Espyo	right, so the game does take the Rock Pikmin into account for the 100 limit
2015-11-22 14:48:29	ScruffyChat	And the Rock Pikmin are invisible, but the map showed a black dot where they are spawned
2015-11-22 14:48:34	@Espyo	heh
2015-11-22 14:49:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the game expects you to know about Rock Pikmin by the time you reach 100 in the field
2015-11-22 14:49:57	ScruffyChat	So I guess that
2015-11-22 14:50:06	ScruffyChat	That's an oversight?
2015-11-22 14:54:31	@Espyo	I'd say so
2015-11-22 14:54:36	@Espyo	we have to add this too
2015-11-22 14:54:43	@Espyo	to the wiki, I mean

2015-11-22 23:29:14	ScruffyChat	Het Espyo
2015-11-22 23:29:40	ScruffyChat	I noticed that the search result for Pikipedia is now called "A Pikmin Wiki"
2015-11-22 23:30:59	@Espyo	huh?
2015-11-22 23:32:04	ScruffyChat	If you google search "pikipedia," the first search result which brings you to pikipedia is called "A Pikmin Wiki."
2015-11-22 23:33:07	ScruffyChat	Just wondering if that was intentional
2015-11-22 23:33:59	@Espyo	nope, not intentional
2015-11-22 23:34:06	ScruffyChat	Ah, ok
2015-11-22 23:34:27	ScruffyChat	Weird
2015-11-22 23:35:15	@Espyo	"the Pikmin encyclopedia" on my end
2015-11-22 23:36:28	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-11-22 23:37:06	ScruffyChat	That is weird, there should only be one name
2015-11-22 23:37:43	ScruffyChat	But how would you change it?
2015-11-22 23:39:42	@Espyo	I think it's a page attribute
2015-11-22 23:40:17	@Espyo	if you right click any wiki page and read the source, there should be that "a Pikmin Wiki" or "the Pikmin encyclopedia" on a property somewhere
2015-11-22 23:40:56	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-22 23:44:04	@Espyo	nope, nothing apparently

2015-11-23 19:03:10	@Espyo	throat, runny nose, stomachache
2015-11-23 19:03:18	@Espyo	...and now I've got a fever and asthma
2015-11-23 19:03:27	@Espyo	doesn't really sound right
2015-11-23 19:03:44	Yoshi2	sounds like you've been on one hell of a ride
2015-11-23 19:03:57	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-23 19:04:08	@Espyo	it all starts when I feel my throat weird and it's annoying to swallow
2015-11-23 19:04:19	@Espyo	but last time this happened, I logged it
2015-11-23 19:04:26	@Espyo	and what happened doesn't match what's happening now at all

2015-11-23 19:21:25	@Espyo	...really?
2015-11-23 19:21:30	@Espyo	one of the videos on my subscription feed
2015-11-23 19:21:38	@Espyo	is "Why You Shouldn't Go To Work While You're Sick"
2015-11-23 19:22:22	Yoshi2	in my case, I got some antibiotics and some days later it went away
2015-11-23 19:22:33	@Espyo	right
2015-11-23 19:22:49	@Espyo	well, I'll certainly take something
2015-11-23 19:22:52	@Espyo	at least to help the fever
2015-11-23 19:37:50	@J	you're sure it's not flu?
2015-11-23 19:38:08	@J	also the asthma part doesn't sound right if you're not actually asthmatic
2015-11-23 19:45:48	@Espyo	heh, I am
2015-11-23 19:45:54	@Espyo	I am asthmatic... slightly
2015-11-23 19:46:01	@Espyo	I breathe just fine throughout normal days
2015-11-23 19:46:13	@Espyo	I can't fill my lungs as full as most people, but still live a perfectly normal life
2015-11-23 19:46:19	@Espyo	but if stuff like this gets me, it starts getting tight
2015-11-23 19:46:27	@Espyo	never once needed a pump or anything though
2015-11-23 19:46:37	@Espyo	got it ever since I turned 14
2015-11-23 19:47:02	@Espyo	I'm not sure if it's something as aggressive as a flu but... maybe...?
2015-11-23 19:51:53	Klemen702	not sure which is worse. This. or me having problems with my right thumb making me holding pens, and my handwriting terrible
2015-11-23 19:52:15	@Espyo	hmm
2015-11-23 19:52:18	@Espyo	well, this is temporary
2015-11-23 19:52:20	@Espyo	dunno about your thing
2015-11-23 19:52:31	Klemen702	mine ain't
2015-11-23 19:52:41	@Espyo	ouch
2015-11-23 19:52:43	@Espyo	then yours is worse
2015-11-23 19:52:53	Klemen702	D:
2015-11-23 19:53:04	Klemen702	atleast it's not a big deal
2015-11-23 19:53:09	Klemen702	ASLONG AS I WRITE LIKE THIS IT'S FINE
2015-11-23 19:53:23	@Espyo	hehe
2015-11-23 19:53:34	Yoshi2	I have no problems with my thumbs and my handwriting is still bad
2015-11-23 19:54:07	Klemen702	mine can't position a part properly
2015-11-23 19:54:59	Klemen702	making it feel weird when i hold it like most of you do
2015-11-23 19:55:02	Klemen702	i'll draw a pic
2015-11-23 19:56:17	@Espyo	I have horrible handwriting, and I hold pens weirdly too
2015-11-23 20:00:03	Klemen702	http://pasteboard.co/2mhpz2Tu.png also included a story cuz i forgot to tell

2015-11-23 20:03:55	@Espyo	woah, life-threatening
2015-11-23 20:03:58	@Espyo	the joints in your fingers?
2015-11-23 20:04:02	Klemen702	ye
2015-11-23 20:04:10	@Espyo	ouch
2015-11-23 20:04:24	@Espyo	that's the kind of stuff that scares me in day to day life
2015-11-23 20:04:33	Klemen702	it was removed atleast, so i don't think there would be any danger anymore
2015-11-23 20:04:39	@Espyo	one wrong hand in the wrong place at the wrong time... boom, you messed up something about your lifestyle forever
2015-11-23 20:04:40	Klemen702	from what i was told
2015-11-23 20:04:50	@Espyo	weird that there'd even be a danger to begin with
2015-11-23 20:04:56	@Espyo	it's a finger, it's not like it has major arteries or anyhting
2015-11-23 20:04:56	Klemen702	yeah
2015-11-23 20:04:57	@Espyo	*anything
2015-11-23 20:05:01	Klemen702	i am confused to
2015-11-23 20:05:02	@Espyo	but hey, if they said so...

2015-11-23 20:09:17	Klemen702	if anyone wants to stop these sadish topics i can stop speaking
2015-11-23 20:10:51	Klemen702	does anyone here own or know about the HP computer kinds?
2015-11-23 20:11:12	Klemen702	just wondering since there is something i am worried about
2015-11-23 20:11:14	@Espyo	yeah, let's
2015-11-23 20:11:17	@Espyo	I'm using an HP right now
2015-11-23 20:11:27	Klemen702	well
2015-11-23 20:12:13	Klemen702	http://pasteboard.co/2mi74vZP.png this logo thing turned into a windows 10-ish look earlier. And it also asked me to restart my computer. Just wondering if it's an HP thing
2015-11-23 20:12:29	Klemen702	since a friend of mine told that microsoft is trying to make windows 7 and 8 users switch to 10
2015-11-23 20:12:39	@Espyo	yeah, that's probably what it is
2015-11-23 20:12:46	@Espyo	windows 7 and 8 users can upgrade to 10 for free
2015-11-23 20:12:52	@Espyo	...weird that it told you to restart though
2015-11-23 20:12:59	@Espyo	I don't suppose it installed windows 10 silently without you agreeing
2015-11-23 20:13:00	Klemen702	ye but i don't want to upgrade
2015-11-23 20:13:05	@Espyo	but microsoft are nuts enough to do that
2015-11-23 20:13:09	@Espyo	neither do I
2015-11-23 20:13:10	Klemen702	well
2015-11-23 20:13:16	Klemen702	i'll hope for the best i guess
2015-11-23 20:13:16	@Espyo	I disabled the notification on my end, but I can't remember how
2015-11-23 20:13:27	@Espyo	has your internet been slow for the past few hours?
2015-11-23 20:14:02	Klemen702	not really
2015-11-23 20:14:10	@Espyo	then I wouldn't worry
2015-11-23 20:14:15	Klemen702	allthrough i have only been using the computer to watch anime today so idk
2015-11-23 20:14:17	@Espyo	but yeah, I doubt it's an HP warning

2015-11-23 20:18:51	Yoshi2	one thing that I find more depressing than talking about death is reading about how big companies make stupid decisions like installing self-signed certificates on notebooks

2015-11-23 20:19:43	En_Passant	self-signed certificates?
2015-11-23 20:20:34	Yoshi2	yes
2015-11-23 20:21:56	Yoshi2	certificates are used for making sure that the website you are connecting to is indeed the website they claim to be

2015-11-24 22:30:37	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-24 22:32:48	Scruffy	I'm not terribly familiar with the series
2015-11-24 22:33:11	Scruffy	But a universal strategy for boss battles is to use up the most powerful stuff first
2015-11-24 22:33:32	Scruffy	Before you are killed and rendered unable to use it 
2015-11-24 22:34:37	Scruffy	I guess
2015-11-24 22:39:01	@PikFan	okay, so
2015-11-24 22:39:22	@PikFan	I kinda want to make the battle with the Snagret its own chapter, that way I could detail the battle more
2015-11-24 22:39:34	@PikFan	and then the Winged Pikmin's entrance would end the chapter
2015-11-24 22:39:49	@PikFan	the next chapter would deal with introducing the Winged Pikmin and all that good stuff
2015-11-24 22:39:51	@PikFan	but...
2015-11-24 22:40:25	@PikFan	what I also could do is keep that together, but the Winged Pikmin leave suddenly
2015-11-24 22:40:39	@PikFan	which confuses the Red Pikmin, and the chapter ends there
2015-11-24 22:40:59	@PikFan	what do you think?
2015-11-24 22:41:03	@PikFan	@Scruffy
2015-11-24 22:43:51	Scruffy	Sorry, back
2015-11-24 22:45:12	Scruffy	I don't think Winged Pikmin should leave right after being introduced
2015-11-24 22:46:12	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-11-24 22:46:16	@PikFan	explain
2015-11-24 22:46:56	Scruffy	Having a character or group of characters leave right after being introduced not only confuses other characters, it confuses the reader
2015-11-24 22:46:59	Scruffy	I mean, not always
2015-11-24 22:47:20	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-24 22:47:52	@PikFan	if there was a reason why they left so early, would it be less confusing to the reader?
2015-11-24 22:47:58	@PikFan	and the other characters
2015-11-24 22:48:31	@PikFan	like, say it's near sunset, and they have to get back to their Onion, or something of that affect
2015-11-24 22:50:21	Scruffy	I guess so
2015-11-24 22:50:39	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-11-24 22:50:39	Scruffy	It'd be cool if the Wingeds were so far from their Onion they had to bunk in the Red Onion for the nigth
2015-11-24 22:50:47	@PikFan	oh, maybe
2015-11-24 22:51:06	Scruffy	Or the crumbling rubble damages their Onion but it's too close to sunset to repair
2015-11-24 22:51:21	@PikFan	I mean, I've already broken the 100 Pikmin rule, so I guess I could break that rule, too
2015-11-24 22:51:48	@PikFan	and P3's Master Onion accepts different types
2015-11-24 22:52:05	@PikFan	perhaps this could be a foreshadowing
2015-11-24 22:52:35	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-24 22:52:47	@PikFan	I had an idea that the Winged's Onion is actually on a cloud
2015-11-24 22:52:48	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-24 22:53:01	Scruffy	Oooh
2015-11-24 22:53:03	@PikFan	speaking of, the game refers to their Onion as the "Winged Onion"
2015-11-24 22:53:09	@PikFan	P3, I mean
2015-11-24 22:53:11	Scruffy	Hmm
2015-11-24 22:53:17	Scruffy	That makes sense
2015-11-24 22:53:26	Scruffy	I only ever call it pink for convenience
2015-11-24 22:53:31	@PikFan	because I also did that experiment, the game says "Save the Winged Onion!"
2015-11-24 22:54:30	Scruffy	Oh yeaaaahhh
2015-11-24 22:54:32	@PikFan	now we just need to figure out what the game calls the gray Onion...
2015-11-24 22:54:41	@PikFan	Rock Onion? *shrugs*
2015-11-24 22:55:05	Scruffy	It sounds reasonable
2015-11-24 22:56:12	Scruffy	I've gotta go
2015-11-24 22:56:14	Scruffy	Sorry
2015-11-24 22:56:21	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-24 22:56:24	@PikFan	bye
2015-11-24 22:56:24	Scruffy	I've got a lot of catching up to do
2015-11-24 22:56:26	Scruffy	Bye!

2015-11-24 22:56:42	@PikFan	Espyo, what should we do about the Onions' naming?
2015-11-24 23:04:46	@Espyo	lowercase color, uppercase "Onion"
2015-11-24 23:04:54	@Espyo	the color is just an adjective, not part of the name
2015-11-24 23:04:58	@Espyo	because the Onions were never named
2015-11-24 23:05:21	@PikFan	well, the game says "Winged Onion"
2015-11-24 23:11:43	@Espyo	...where?
2015-11-24 23:12:13	@PikFan	if you discover their Onion but not free it till the next day or later

2015-11-24 23:12:37	@Espyo	hm
2015-11-24 23:12:42	@Espyo	well, Pikmin 3 does a lot of things wrong
2015-11-24 23:12:52	@Espyo	like Title Case EVERYTHING
2015-11-24 23:13:50	@PikFan	sure
2015-11-24 23:14:10	@PikFan	but we need to look for other instances of <color> Onion
2015-11-24 23:14:16	@PikFan	and see if it's capitalized then
2015-11-24 23:14:30	@PikFan	it might just be the style, like you said, since it's only four words in that case
2015-11-24 23:15:00	@PikFan	hmm, I wonder if there's anything in the Check in
2015-11-24 23:15:03	@PikFan	[[Check in]]

2015-11-24 23:17:13	@PikFan	regardless, we definitely know that the game refers to their Onion as "winged", not "pink"
2015-11-24 23:19:43	@Espyo	I see
2015-11-24 23:20:38	@Espyo	well, guess we should search the entire wiki for "pink Onion" and replace with "Winged Onion"
2015-11-24 23:20:39	@Espyo	capital W?
2015-11-24 23:20:43	@Espyo	eh, I'll check the files tomorrow
2015-11-24 23:21:31	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-24 23:21:48	@PikFan	we also need to find out how the game refers to the Rock Pikmin's Onion...
2015-11-24 23:22:14	@PikFan	going by this, I'm going to say it calls it the Rock Onion, but I can't say for sure

2015-11-25 19:59:50	@Espyo	I don't know, the folks on skype are saying a lot of stuff

2015-11-25 20:09:36	@Espyo	heck, if we find a decent editor, they might add their twitter or youtube account to their profile

2015-11-25 20:47:51	@Espyo	money
2015-11-25 20:47:53	@Espyo	it gives them like
2015-11-25 20:48:00	@PikFan	0.00001%
2015-11-25 20:48:00	@Espyo	 4 cents profit at the end of the year
2015-11-25 20:48:01	@Espyo	that's money!
2015-11-25 20:48:12	@PikFan	bah
2015-11-25 20:48:37	@PikFan	I'm just really concerned that this is going to happen all over again when Pikmin 4 comes around
2015-11-25 20:48:45	@PikFan	like, REALLY concerned
2015-11-25 20:49:38	@PikFan	the community would be just fine if it wasn't for that cancer wikia
2015-11-25 20:49:54	@PikFan	what's so great about wikia, anyway?
2015-11-25 20:50:09	@PikFan	if you dare have an opposing opinion, they make you disappear
2015-11-25 20:50:32	@PikFan	and for socializing?
2015-11-25 20:50:41	@Espyo	it WILL happen
2015-11-25 20:50:42	@PikFan	well, that's what IRC, Skype, and the forums are for
2015-11-25 20:50:43	@Espyo	but here's the good news
2015-11-25 20:50:48	@Espyo	most good editors and fans are with us
2015-11-25 20:50:59	@Espyo	the new community on wikia will be like 10% people we wish we had on our side
2015-11-25 20:51:07	@Espyo	and 90% kiddies
2015-11-25 20:51:30	@PikFan	the problem is that it'll be getting more views
2015-11-25 20:53:09	@PikFan	maybe I should become a hacker so that I can attack Pikmin Wiki with DOS errors
2015-11-25 20:54:18	@PikFan	"This community is still a valid one, and there is good work being done here.  It's great to see people still enjoying it, and to see the possibilities there are for the new community to grow."
2015-11-25 20:54:19	@PikFan	lolno
2015-11-25 20:54:41	@PikFan	by "great work" you mean crappy, super low quality edits and socializing
2015-11-25 20:55:43	@Espyo	DoS could get you in trouble
2015-11-25 20:55:52	@Espyo	of course they do
2015-11-25 21:00:05	@PikFan	this is such a pain...
2015-11-25 21:00:25	@PikFan	by the way, did you check P3's files for the Onion names?
2015-11-25 21:00:59	@Espyo	never got to doing that
2015-11-25 21:01:01	@Espyo	remind me today
2015-11-25 21:01:04	@Espyo	in like an hour
2015-11-25 21:01:08	@Espyo	anyway, it's not all that bad
2015-11-25 21:01:16	@Espyo	for one thing, wikia's new greedy administration might bring a new age of greed
2015-11-25 21:01:20	@Espyo	which results in what? revolution
2015-11-25 21:01:32	@Espyo	plus, like I said, most fans are already aware of Pikipedia
2015-11-25 21:01:34	@Espyo	and heck, prefer us
2015-11-25 21:01:39	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure that Sannse has been around for a while
2015-11-25 21:01:39	@Espyo	only retards like kirby bulborb don't
2015-11-25 21:01:49	@PikFan	and kirbyddd
2015-11-25 21:01:56	@Espyo	and on top of that, if we hurry with Pikmin 4 info, we can capture a LOT of fans
2015-11-25 21:02:06	@Espyo	if we're the only ones with info on how to defeat this boss, or how to get that treasure
2015-11-25 21:02:12	@Espyo	we'll get new fans that didn't know of us
2015-11-25 21:02:19	@Espyo	and people will stop going to the wikia as they take longer to catch up
2015-11-25 21:02:20	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-25 21:02:29	@PikFan	heh, so this'll be a game in and of itself
2015-11-25 21:02:31	@Espyo	plus Chugga might still give us a shoutout
2015-11-25 21:02:36	@Espyo	and we have reddit and such on our side
2015-11-25 21:02:42	@Espyo	and we just keep growing and growing
2015-11-25 21:02:48	@Espyo	we're the strongest we've ever been, and wikia's the weakest
2015-11-25 21:02:54	@PikFan	a game between Pikipedia and Pikmin Wiki
2015-11-25 21:03:00	@Espyo	a sad one
2015-11-25 21:03:09	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-25 21:03:29	@PikFan	when I get Pikmin 4, I need to actually contribute this time
2015-11-25 21:03:41	@PikFan	never mind the quality and policy-breaking; it's still information
2015-11-25 21:03:50	@PikFan	it can be revised later, after the initial flurry
2015-11-25 21:05:07	@PikFan	I'm just wondering when they will show information
2015-11-25 21:11:04	@Espyo	thing is, the policy this time is helping mold the info
2015-11-25 21:11:07	@Espyo	not limit it
2015-11-25 21:11:20	@Espyo	before, if we needed to add info about, say, an enemy
2015-11-25 21:11:21	@PikFan	right
2015-11-25 21:11:23	@Espyo	where would we begin?
2015-11-25 21:11:26	@Espyo	the infobox, but then what?
2015-11-25 21:11:37	@Espyo	now, with the policy, we know we can write about behavior, locations, etc.
2015-11-25 21:11:41	@PikFan	but the thing is, my perfectionism tells me I have to follow the policy EXACTLY
2015-11-25 21:11:52	@PikFan	and the tiniest bit compromises everything
2015-11-25 21:11:54	@Espyo	...of course, it's a double-edged sword in that it'll make us take forever just to get ONE enemy done
2015-11-25 21:12:05	@Espyo	but hey, even the current enemy articles don't fully follow the policy
2015-11-25 21:12:13	@PikFan	huh
2015-11-25 21:12:14	@Espyo	so we should use the policy's organization aspects, not the completion ones
2015-11-25 21:12:15	@PikFan	how so?
2015-11-25 21:12:34	@Espyo	[[Special:RandomInCategory/Pikmin 2 enemies]] (hope this link works)

2015-11-25 21:13:37	@PikFan	awesome
2015-11-25 21:13:40	@Espyo	anyway, now check [[Pikipedia:Enemy article policy]]

2015-11-25 21:13:44	@PikFan	/late
2015-11-25 21:13:59	@Espyo	notice how it's probably missing the behavior section
2015-11-25 21:14:04	@Espyo	how the location section is not how it should be
2015-11-25 21:14:12	@Espyo	the strategy section is probably missing stuff
2015-11-25 21:14:22	@Espyo	the gallery is definitely missing some images in the policy
2015-11-25 21:14:29	@Espyo	the policy is honestly more of an "ideal article" guidelines
2015-11-25 21:14:32	@Espyo	*-s
2015-11-25 21:14:38	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-25 21:14:47	@PikFan	my biggest concern is the area articles
2015-11-25 21:15:00	@PikFan	I mean, creating them, that is
2015-11-25 21:15:26	@PikFan	because I'm not too with describing something that already exists
2015-11-25 21:15:32	@PikFan	*I'm not too great
2015-11-25 21:16:10	@PikFan	so, should I try to describe too much instead of too little, when making articles?
2015-11-25 21:18:12	@Espyo	hmm
2015-11-25 21:18:14	@Espyo	I'd say so
2015-11-25 21:18:15	@PikFan	oh, also, you can make polls, right? I was thinking about adding a new poll to Fanon's page
2015-11-25 21:18:18	@Espyo	it can always be cut down if it's too big
2015-11-25 21:18:20	@Espyo	oh yeah, you asked
2015-11-25 21:18:21	@Espyo	sure thing
2015-11-25 21:18:25	@PikFan	sweet
2015-11-25 21:18:28	@Espyo	but don't you guys have somebody in charge of polldaddy polls over there?
2015-11-25 21:18:39	@PikFan	yeah, Wraith, but he's hardly ever on
2015-11-25 21:19:35	@PikFan	alright, I gotta go, class starts in a couple minutes

2015-11-25 22:25:27	Testyo	Done. I saved an alarm for 25/11/2015 22:50 (GMT), saying Espyo, check the files.
2015-11-25 22:25:30	@Espyo	wow

2015-11-25 22:51:05	@Espyo	thanks, Testyo
2015-11-25 22:51:06	Testyo	if you want to see it for yourself, get a hex editor and check out pikiseq.arc at offset 0x22CA0, that's the start of the logs said that I had started
2015-11-25 22:51:21	@Espyo	...you know where the stuff I'm searching for is?
2015-11-25 22:51:25	@Espyo	wow, what CAN'T you do, Testyo?
2015-11-25 22:51:26	Testyo	though if we could get EU ISOs to be taken straight from one of the Pikmin games

2015-11-25 22:51:37	@Espyo	ah yes, I need to check the US AND the EU ISO
2015-11-25 22:51:41	@Espyo	thanks, Testyo
2015-11-25 22:51:42	Testyo	the entire thing is a word you want to use there
2015-11-25 22:51:45	@Espyo	I KNOW
2015-11-25 22:51:51	@Espyo	THIS ENTIRE THING IS ABOUT THE WORD "WINGED"

2015-11-25 22:53:11	@Espyo	a demigod
2015-11-25 23:10:10	@Espyo	ok, so I could check all the strings in all the files
2015-11-25 23:10:13	@Espyo	or make a script to do it for me
2015-11-25 23:10:16	@Espyo	starting to like Python
2015-11-25 23:10:24	@Espyo	there, instant find
2015-11-25 23:10:26	@Espyo	Chapter.msbt
2015-11-25 23:10:30	@Espyo	"Save the Winged Onion!"
2015-11-25 23:10:33	@Espyo	European copy
2015-11-25 23:10:45	@Espyo	Chapter.msbt is the titles given to each day on the day selection screen
2015-11-25 23:10:47	@Espyo	well, there's that
2015-11-25 23:10:51	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-25 23:10:55	@Espyo	no "Rock Onion"
2015-11-25 23:10:59	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-25 23:11:11	@Espyo	though if Rock is in one line, and Onion in the other, it won't find it
2015-11-25 23:11:14	@Espyo	so this isn't 100% accurate
2015-11-25 23:11:25	@PikFan	is that the only instance of "Winged Onion"?
2015-11-25 23:11:29	@Espyo	the US version uses the same "chapter", "Save the Winged Onion"
2015-11-25 23:11:34	@PikFan	right, yeah
2015-11-25 23:11:35	@Espyo	yeah, only instance, in both versions
2015-11-25 23:11:42	@PikFan	...I see
2015-11-25 23:11:47	@Espyo	and no instances of Rock Onion anywhere
2015-11-25 23:11:54	@PikFan	quite the conundrum...
2015-11-25 23:13:17	@PikFan	we can't just ignore "Winged Onion", even if it's only one instance
2015-11-25 23:13:30	@PikFan	it has to be recognized somehow
2015-11-25 23:14:03	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-25 23:14:08	@Espyo	I say we go for it
2015-11-25 23:14:17	@Espyo	switch to Rock and Winged Onion
2015-11-25 23:14:31	@PikFan	and caps, too?
2015-11-25 23:14:39	@PikFan	because I thought you were against title case
2015-11-25 23:14:49	@Espyo	well, it's more like a name in this case
2015-11-25 23:14:54	@PikFan	right
2015-11-25 23:14:58	@Espyo	it's really a question of looking at it: "does it look like it's a name, or a title?"
2015-11-25 23:15:04	@PikFan	yeah, winged Onion doesn't really sound good
2015-11-25 23:15:07	@Espyo	when you scan a dirt mound and get "Dirt Mound"
2015-11-25 23:15:11	@Espyo	it's a title for the scan entry
2015-11-25 23:15:21	@Espyo	you don't really call it Dirt Mound like it's its proper name
2015-11-25 23:15:28	@Espyo	any more than you'd call your neighbor's gate Neighbor's Gate
2015-11-25 23:15:34	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-25 23:16:00	@PikFan	so then, what do we do for all the other Onions? capitalize them too?
2015-11-25 23:16:25	@PikFan	and we still need to resolve that Master Onion thing
2015-11-25 23:16:33	@PikFan	the game probably doesn't call it that
2015-11-25 23:16:36	@Espyo	yeah, capitalize them
2015-11-25 23:16:40	@Espyo	oh, now's a great time to check, actually
2015-11-25 23:16:47	@Espyo	hm, we can probably check the e-manual too
2015-11-25 23:17:01	@PikFan	oh, nice
2015-11-25 23:17:07	@Espyo	no results for the US
2015-11-25 23:17:14	@Espyo	no results for europe

2015-11-26 00:04:54	@Espyo	or it could stay master, but we'd have to lowercase it
2015-11-26 00:05:06	@PikFan	right
2015-11-26 00:07:37	@Espyo	going to bed now

2015-11-27 03:33:28	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2015-11-27 03:33:33	Scruffy	Hey PikFan!
2015-11-27 03:33:38	Scruffy	Happy Thanksgiving
2015-11-27 03:33:46	@PikFan	yeah, thanks
2015-11-27 03:33:54	@PikFan	did you have a good Thanksgiving?
2015-11-27 03:34:00	Scruffy	Definitely
2015-11-27 03:34:05	@PikFan	I did too
2015-11-27 03:34:08	@PikFan	so much food
2015-11-27 03:34:13	Scruffy	So much
2015-11-27 03:34:49	@PikFan	my mom makes these amazing rolls and they're so fluffy and chewy
2015-11-27 03:34:54	Scruffy	I'm a pescatarian, but turkey was easily replaced with wild Alaskan salmon
2015-11-27 03:35:10	Scruffy	Oh, rolls are the best
2015-11-27 03:35:15	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-27 03:35:22	@PikFan	indeed they are
2015-11-27 03:35:33	@PikFan	Thanksgiving dinner just isn't complete without them
2015-11-27 03:35:49	Scruffy	And this year I learned to make apple pie
2015-11-27 03:35:53	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-27 03:35:57	Scruffy	Adding lemon juice is key
2015-11-27 03:36:01	Scruffy	Makes it nice and tart
2015-11-27 03:36:09	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-27 03:36:20	@PikFan	I prefer chocolate and pumpkin pie
2015-11-27 03:36:37	Scruffy	Ooh
2015-11-27 03:36:46	Scruffy	Well, I at least had pumpkin as well
2015-11-27 03:36:52	@PikFan	I've always wondered why pie-eating is such a big tradition in Thanksgiving
2015-11-27 03:37:08	Scruffy	I've always wondered why Thanksgiving is a tradition at all
2015-11-27 03:37:19	Scruffy	I don't feel like the first Thanksgiving is how it went down
2015-11-27 03:37:32	Scruffy	But it's still a nice sentiment
2015-11-27 03:37:51	@PikFan	it's a nice excuse to pig out on food
2015-11-27 03:37:56	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-27 03:38:18	Scruffy	The final three months of the year, beginning with Halloween
2015-11-27 03:38:27	Scruffy	are just food-filled
2015-11-27 03:38:35	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 03:38:50	Scruffy	And now the Christmas season officially starts for me
2015-11-27 03:39:05	Scruffy	Although a lot of ads seem to have totally skipped over Thanksgiving
2015-11-27 03:39:09	@PikFan	the irony in Thanksgiving is that we are thankful on that day but then the very next day people are hurting each other for sales on things
2015-11-27 03:39:17	Scruffy	Hahaha
2015-11-27 03:39:20	Scruffy	Yeah...
2015-11-27 03:39:31	@PikFan	it's sad...
2015-11-27 03:40:02	Scruffy	I feel like eventually the polarity of Black Friday mentality reverses
2015-11-27 03:40:18	@PikFan	I can understand demand vs supply, but the violence on Black Friday is too much
2015-11-27 03:40:19	Scruffy	And everyone is either scared or doesn't want to go out into the mess, so no mess appears
2015-11-27 03:40:33	Scruffy	But every year a mess does appear
2015-11-27 03:40:40	@PikFan	unfortunately
2015-11-27 03:40:54	@PikFan	I imagine that there's already been rioting
2015-11-27 03:41:09	@PikFan	how early do stores open this year?
2015-11-27 03:41:25	Scruffy	I don't know
2015-11-27 03:41:30	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-27 03:41:36	Scruffy	Black Friday can't begin any earlier than midnight
2015-11-27 03:41:36	@PikFan	then, I'll do a search
2015-11-27 03:41:47	Scruffy	But your midnight begins after mine
2015-11-27 03:42:21	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 03:42:54	Scruffy	My roommates have been telling me that fewer and fewer people are hopping aboard the Black Friday train when it's more convenient and less dangerous to use Cyber Monday
2015-11-27 03:43:07	Scruffy	And really I find that to be a much more efficient idea
2015-11-27 03:43:30	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-27 03:43:41	@PikFan	hmm, it looks like most stores still open after midnight
2015-11-27 03:43:48	@PikFan	some retailers open before, though
2015-11-27 03:43:53	Scruffy	Woah
2015-11-27 03:44:03	Scruffy	Well no matter what, people are going to be camping out
2015-11-27 03:44:11	Scruffy	It's absolutely crazy
2015-11-27 03:44:16	@PikFan	too crazy
2015-11-27 03:44:27	@PikFan	did they just forget about being thankful, or what
2015-11-27 03:44:39	@PikFan	it's utter nonsense
2015-11-27 03:44:59	Scruffy	I agree
2015-11-27 03:45:12	@PikFan	well, money just has that affect on people, I suppose
2015-11-27 03:45:32	Scruffy	That reminds me
2015-11-27 03:45:39	Scruffy	I'm almost finished with Chapter 1 of Louie
2015-11-27 03:45:41	Scruffy	I think
2015-11-27 03:45:55	@PikFan	ah, nice
2015-11-27 03:46:00	Scruffy	I should finish that up
2015-11-27 03:46:07	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 03:46:12	Scruffy	I went into greater detail than I expected
2015-11-27 03:46:22	Scruffy	Louie doesn't even get to when he was born yet
2015-11-27 03:46:41	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-27 03:46:42	Scruffy	First he talks about how his grandmother and dad got where they are
2015-11-27 03:47:00	@PikFan	do you know how long it is?
2015-11-27 03:47:35	Scruffy	1164 words so far
2015-11-27 03:47:42	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-27 03:48:31	@PikFan	speaking of stories, I'm still not sure what to do with MW Chapter 5
2015-11-27 03:48:38	Scruffy	Maybe I can help
2015-11-27 03:48:49	Scruffy	Oh!
2015-11-27 03:48:53	@PikFan	hm?
2015-11-27 03:49:02	Scruffy	Also, I uploaded an update of the Torrid Desert preview
2015-11-27 03:49:08	Scruffy	I don't know if you saw
2015-11-27 03:49:09	@PikFan	oh, yeah!
2015-11-27 03:49:16	@PikFan	I did see that
2015-11-27 03:49:26	@PikFan	it looks great!
2015-11-27 03:49:31	Scruffy	Thank you! :)
2015-11-27 03:49:32	@PikFan	I just have a couple of concerns
2015-11-27 03:49:37	Scruffy	No problem
2015-11-27 03:49:42	@PikFan	the first one is really minor
2015-11-27 03:50:08	Scruffy	mhm?
2015-11-27 03:50:11	@PikFan	the Pellet Posy on the right is a lot brighter than the one on the left
2015-11-27 03:50:37	Scruffy	oh, yeah
2015-11-27 03:50:43	Scruffy	The pellets are a glossy material
2015-11-27 03:50:49	Scruffy	I could make them more diffuse
2015-11-27 03:50:58	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-27 03:50:58	Scruffy	and that'd even them out
2015-11-27 03:51:23	@PikFan	though, why is it brighter? what's it reflecting, since you mentioned glossiness?
2015-11-27 03:52:01	Scruffy	It's reflecting the sky
2015-11-27 03:52:12	Scruffy	The darker one is reflecting a cliff that was in the background
2015-11-27 03:52:16	Scruffy	I think
2015-11-27 03:52:42	Scruffy	Yeah, there's a bright source coming from behind the camresa
2015-11-27 03:52:46	Scruffy	camera*
2015-11-27 03:54:01	@PikFan	a...cliff?
2015-11-27 03:54:04	@PikFan	I like it
2015-11-27 03:54:09	Scruffy	Heh
2015-11-27 03:54:20	@PikFan	that could be part of the area
2015-11-27 03:54:23	Scruffy	Yeah, the background is like a tropical island beach
2015-11-27 03:54:35	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-27 03:54:35	Scruffy	And there's a rocky cliff way in the back
2015-11-27 03:54:39	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-27 03:54:49	Scruffy	But I've rotated it so that the palm trees are the focus
2015-11-27 03:54:57	@PikFan	right
2015-11-27 03:55:28	@PikFan	hm, yeah, can you make them the same brightness? sorry to be so nitpicky
2015-11-27 03:55:44	Scruffy	No problem!
2015-11-27 03:55:57	Scruffy	Any other concerns?
2015-11-27 03:58:42	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-27 03:58:56	@PikFan	the first image seemed rich in color
2015-11-27 03:59:03	@PikFan	and this new one feels quite dull
2015-11-27 03:59:11	Scruffy	Yeah, I removed the color correction
2015-11-27 03:59:14	Scruffy	Or rather
2015-11-27 03:59:14	@PikFan	was that an effect of trying to add the shadows?
2015-11-27 03:59:24	Scruffy	I didn't put color correction on this one
2015-11-27 03:59:41	Scruffy	Because I can't get my photo editing software to work quite yet
2015-11-27 03:59:48	Scruffy	I think all it needs is an update
2015-11-27 04:00:05	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-27 04:00:16	Scruffy	But, that added extra color to it
2015-11-27 04:00:29	@PikFan	right, which I liked
2015-11-27 04:00:36	Scruffy	Sorry about that
2015-11-27 04:00:48	Scruffy	Next pass on this photo, I will add color correction back in
2015-11-27 04:00:49	@PikFan	hmm, I think I like the color better than the shadows, if the shadows interfere with the color
2015-11-27 04:01:23	Scruffy	The shadows didn't do much to the color, but I can compare the image with and without them
2015-11-27 04:01:34	Scruffy	Today I learned how to separate a photo into "passes"
2015-11-27 04:01:45	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-11-27 04:02:00	Scruffy	For example, you could have a pass that shows only direct light bounces
2015-11-27 04:02:06	Scruffy	Or one that shows only reflections
2015-11-27 04:02:15	Scruffy	Or one with only the shadows
2015-11-27 04:03:04	Scruffy	Or even one with only speed-to-color values on every object
2015-11-27 04:03:21	Scruffy	In case you wanted to manually add motion blur in some post-processing program
2015-11-27 04:04:13	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-27 04:04:50	Scruffy	But anyway, that doesn't really matter for this render unless you would like to see how it's all put together
2015-11-27 04:04:56	Scruffy	Which would be a collection of several photos
2015-11-27 04:05:09	@PikFan	I respectfully decline
2015-11-27 04:05:16	Scruffy	Heh no problem
2015-11-27 04:05:32	Scruffy	I'll add in the color correction, that's something that's done after the whole photo is complete
2015-11-27 04:05:41	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-27 04:05:45	Scruffy	It's just mixing color values
2015-11-27 04:05:59	Scruffy	But in a specific artsy way
2015-11-27 04:06:02	Scruffy	I guess
2015-11-27 04:06:10	@PikFan	I just liked the vibrant feel to it, something that Pikmin 3 did a really good job with
2015-11-27 04:06:15	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:06:29	Scruffy	Pikmin 3 got a great feeling of sunlight
2015-11-27 04:06:35	Scruffy	on a small scale
2015-11-27 04:06:44	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 04:07:21	Scruffy	And most of its enemies are vibrantly colorful or fuzzy
2015-11-27 04:07:27	Scruffy	It's so nice
2015-11-27 04:07:32	@PikFan	oh, so since you've mentioned sunlight, I've been debating with people on the forums over the addition of night mode
2015-11-27 04:07:33	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-27 04:07:52	@PikFan	they seem to have the idea that it would be a thing forced upon the players
2015-11-27 04:08:27	Scruffy	I've seen the thread
2015-11-27 04:08:30	@PikFan	I'm trying to make it clear that it wouldn't be forced
2015-11-27 04:08:34	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:08:38	@PikFan	but they're not really understanding
2015-11-27 04:08:49	@PikFan	I'm getting the feeling they're not reading my entire posts
2015-11-27 04:09:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:09:30	@PikFan	really, night mode is just there for those who want to use it
2015-11-27 04:09:36	@PikFan	completely optional thing
2015-11-27 04:10:03	@PikFan	but they're entitled to their own opinions, I guess
2015-11-27 04:10:30	Scruffy	They seem to feel pretty strongly about it, for some reason
2015-11-27 04:10:37	Scruffy	But I agree with how you see it
2015-11-27 04:10:41	Scruffy	As optional
2015-11-27 04:10:51	@PikFan	right
2015-11-27 04:10:53	Scruffy	Since, if you think about it, it is optional in the game
2015-11-27 04:11:11	Scruffy	The leaders just choose not exploring at night
2015-11-27 04:11:37	@PikFan	yeah, because of the "nocturnal creatures"
2015-11-27 04:11:41	Scruffy	Right
2015-11-27 04:11:56	Scruffy	If you ask me, I'd like to see how those creatures behave at night
2015-11-27 04:12:00	Scruffy	It'd be fun
2015-11-27 04:12:07	Scruffy	scarier but fun
2015-11-27 04:12:09	@PikFan	the whole atmosphere would be fun
2015-11-27 04:12:13	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-27 04:12:33	@PikFan	seeing the areas at night in the Piklopedia made me want to play them very badly
2015-11-27 04:12:40	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:12:46	@PikFan	they just looked so... ethereal
2015-11-27 04:12:51	Chiaki_Nanami	oh hi there
2015-11-27 04:12:53	Chiaki_Nanami	guess what
2015-11-27 04:12:53	Scruffy	Mhm
2015-11-27 04:12:55	Scruffy	Hi!
2015-11-27 04:12:56	@PikFan	hi Pi
2015-11-27 04:12:59	@PikFan	what is it?
2015-11-27 04:13:00	Chiaki_Nanami	I'm sick :(
2015-11-27 04:13:04	Scruffy	aww
2015-11-27 04:13:05	@PikFan	oh no :(
2015-11-27 04:13:11	@PikFan	that's not good
2015-11-27 04:13:24	@PikFan	do you know what's causing it?
2015-11-27 04:13:27	Scruffy	with what sort of illness?
2015-11-27 04:13:35	Chiaki_Nanami	it's the common cold
2015-11-27 04:13:39	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-27 04:13:41	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-27 04:13:43	Chiaki_Nanami	but still
2015-11-27 04:13:51	@PikFan	how bad?
2015-11-27 04:14:03	Chiaki_Nanami	when I'm sick, I'm /sick/
2015-11-27 04:14:10	Chiaki_Nanami	so it's really bad
2015-11-27 04:14:14	Scruffy	aww man, that's rough
2015-11-27 04:14:54	@PikFan	I hope you feel better soon
2015-11-27 04:15:05	Chiaki_Nanami	thanks :)
2015-11-27 04:15:17	@PikFan	so, what's been happening lately?
2015-11-27 04:15:18	Scruffy	I hope so too
2015-11-27 04:15:35	Chiaki_Nanami	well
2015-11-27 04:15:49	Chiaki_Nanami	I found out I passed a course without having to care about the course material in the slightest
2015-11-27 04:16:08	Chiaki_Nanami	that's always the weirdest feel
2015-11-27 04:16:28	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-27 04:17:44	Scruffy	I've found plenty of OJ, water, and listening to a continuous playlist of Pikmin 2 music really helps a cold no matter how bad
2015-11-27 04:17:52	Scruffy	It helped me through a full-on flu
2015-11-27 04:18:00	@PikFan	OJ?
2015-11-27 04:18:06	Scruffy	orange juice
2015-11-27 04:18:09	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-27 04:18:33	@PikFan	last year at Thanksgiving I got a really nasty cold
2015-11-27 04:18:58	@PikFan	I had horrible dizzy spells and I couldn't get up at all, or else I'd be in extreme pain
2015-11-27 04:19:18	@PikFan	my throat was very sore and I had a toothache
2015-11-27 04:19:33	Scruffy	Aww man, I'm sorry
2015-11-27 04:19:40	@PikFan	yeah... it sucked
2015-11-27 04:19:58	@PikFan	worst cold I remember having
2015-11-27 04:20:12	Scruffy	That seems like more than a cold
2015-11-27 04:20:16	@PikFan	I was in bed for 2 days straight, not able to move at all
2015-11-27 04:20:26	Scruffy	At least the toothache part
2015-11-27 04:20:34	@PikFan	yeah, the doctors weren't sure what it wa
2015-11-27 04:20:36	@PikFan	*was
2015-11-27 04:20:49	@PikFan	they took a culture, but couldn't identify what was causing it
2015-11-27 04:21:13	Scruffy	Yikes
2015-11-27 04:21:26	@PikFan	so finally, my grandma came to my house and gave me a morphine bomb
2015-11-27 04:21:32	@PikFan	worked wonders on me
2015-11-27 04:21:41	@PikFan	2 hours later I finally got out of bed
2015-11-27 04:22:03	@PikFan	the dizzy spells finally went away
2015-11-27 04:22:15	@PikFan	so did the toothache, oddly enough
2015-11-27 04:22:25	Scruffy	Well, that's morphine
2015-11-27 04:22:51	@PikFan	my throat was still sore, of course, and I started getting a runny nose, but things were better after that
2015-11-27 04:23:06	Scruffy	That's good
2015-11-27 04:23:22	Scruffy	At least it started behaving like a normal cold
2015-11-27 04:26:08	@PikFan	yep
2015-11-27 04:26:35	@PikFan	a lot of my other family members were sick too, so we ended up having Thanksgiving on Saturday
2015-11-27 04:27:28	Scruffy	The thankfulness renewed
2015-11-27 04:27:39	Scruffy	I'm thankful you and your family pulled through it
2015-11-27 04:27:51	@PikFan	I am too
2015-11-27 04:27:56	@PikFan	but that was last year
2015-11-27 04:28:02	@PikFan	this year, nobody was sick
2015-11-27 04:28:10	@PikFan	which I'm grateful for
2015-11-27 04:28:17	Scruffy	Yay!
2015-11-27 04:28:22	Scruffy	Yeah, that's good
2015-11-27 04:28:29	Scruffy	health is good
2015-11-27 04:28:46	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 04:28:56	Scruffy	Ok, this is killing me
2015-11-27 04:29:01	Scruffy	Are you on Pikipedia?
2015-11-27 04:29:44	Scruffy	If you aren't, if you can open a tab with Pikipedia, you should see the background image of Pikmin amidst flowers
2015-11-27 04:29:59	Scruffy	There's a Red Pikmin in the bottom right corner
2015-11-27 04:30:03	Scruffy	And I can't tell
2015-11-27 04:30:24	Scruffy	If it has spots, or if the speckles on it are just dew drops
2015-11-27 04:31:15	@PikFan	hmm, let me find the image name
2015-11-27 04:31:49	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/e/e0/Wiki-background.jpeg
2015-11-27 04:32:13	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure it's spots
2015-11-27 04:33:00	@PikFan	I think that's just P3's concept art style http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/f5/Pikmin_types_-_Flower.png
2015-11-27 04:33:00	Scruffy	Yeah, now that I look at the whole thing at once
2015-11-27 04:33:04	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:33:25	Scruffy	Are we going to change that if P4 concept art comes out?
2015-11-27 04:33:39	@PikFan	who knows
2015-11-27 04:33:48	@PikFan	we might just leave it the same
2015-11-27 04:33:58	@PikFan	...wait, which were you referring to?
2015-11-27 04:34:46	Scruffy	The wiki background
2015-11-27 04:35:07	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-27 04:35:18	@PikFan	yeah, I think it'll remain the same, but I can't say
2015-11-27 04:35:35	Scruffy	Okay
2015-11-27 04:35:42	Scruffy	It is nice to look at
2015-11-27 04:35:53	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 04:35:57	Scruffy	And the transparency of the pages is really neat
2015-11-27 04:36:19	@PikFan	yep
2015-11-27 04:36:57	@PikFan	by the way, Espyo and I decided to change the way we name Onions
2015-11-27 04:37:16	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2015-11-27 04:37:20	Scruffy	no more "master
2015-11-27 04:37:22	Scruffy	"
2015-11-27 04:37:32	@PikFan	oh, did he tell you?
2015-11-27 04:37:50	Scruffy	No, but I read your notes on the forums
2015-11-27 04:37:54	Scruffy	the forums are useful
2015-11-27 04:37:59	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-11-27 04:37:59	Scruffy	in that regard
2015-11-27 04:37:59	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-27 04:38:14	@PikFan	yes, they are useful
2015-11-27 04:38:30	@PikFan	I feel like it was a good place to announce it
2015-11-27 04:38:31	Scruffy	Hmm
2015-11-27 04:38:34	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:39:01	Scruffy	For Chapter 1, I need an adjective similar to appealing
2015-11-27 04:39:07	Scruffy	Used for a smell
2015-11-27 04:39:23	Scruffy	Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt
2015-11-27 04:39:29	Scruffy	But I'm drawing a blank
2015-11-27 04:40:02	@PikFan	though it's not explicitly smell, would "delicious" work?
2015-11-27 04:40:22	@PikFan	"A delicious aroma filled the room"
2015-11-27 04:40:27	Scruffy	Yes, actually that would work 
2015-11-27 04:40:38	@PikFan	yay
2015-11-27 04:40:45	@PikFan	synonyms are incredibly useful
2015-11-27 04:41:27	Scruffy	I acquiesce
2015-11-27 04:43:19	@PikFan	uh...
2015-11-27 04:43:45	@PikFan	then... do you want a better word than "delicious"?
2015-11-27 04:43:52	Scruffy	No no, that's good
2015-11-27 04:44:06	@PikFan	well, you said "I acquiesce"
2015-11-27 04:44:12	Scruffy	I was just agreeing with your synonym statement with a synonym for agree
2015-11-27 04:44:17	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-27 04:44:54	Scruffy	Anyway
2015-11-27 04:45:11	@PikFan	I actually didn't know what "acquiesce" meant, so I searched for a definition, and Google said "accept something reluctantly but without protest"
2015-11-27 04:45:16	@PikFan	so I was just wondering
2015-11-27 04:45:22	Scruffy	oh shoot
2015-11-27 04:45:32	Scruffy	I thought it was just simple agreement
2015-11-27 04:45:36	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-11-27 04:45:46	@PikFan	well, we learn something every day
2015-11-27 04:45:54	Scruffy	Yep! :D
2015-11-27 04:46:11	Scruffy	Has there been any decision on what to call the fused Onion?
2015-11-27 04:46:35	@PikFan	main or primary
2015-11-27 04:46:49	Scruffy	Ooh
2015-11-27 04:46:54	@PikFan	or just master, except not capitalized
2015-11-27 04:46:54	Scruffy	I like it
2015-11-27 04:46:59	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:47:05	Scruffy	I think I prefer master
2015-11-27 04:47:09	Scruffy	personally
2015-11-27 04:47:19	@PikFan	I'm a little iffy on that, since it might throw people off since they're used to seeing it capitalized, but eh
2015-11-27 04:47:27	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-27 04:47:36	@PikFan	I mean, it throws ME off
2015-11-27 04:47:40	Scruffy	but main or primary implies that it's more important than other Onions
2015-11-27 04:48:15	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-27 04:48:17	Scruffy	whereas master connotes master key, something with multiple purposes
2015-11-27 04:48:34	Scruffy	Or multiple Pikmin types to use
2015-11-27 04:48:50	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-11-27 04:49:00	@PikFan	well, I guess you could ask Espyo about it
2015-11-27 04:49:08	@PikFan	we haven't started changing the pages yet
2015-11-27 04:49:12	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 04:49:19	Scruffy	No problem, no rush
2015-11-27 04:51:26	Scruffy	I'd say one of the more impressive things for me in P3 was the random swirly liquid pattern on the Onions
2015-11-27 04:51:31	Scruffy	visually, that is
2015-11-27 04:51:38	@PikFan	oh yes
2015-11-27 04:51:42	@PikFan	that was a nice touch
2015-11-27 04:51:54	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-27 04:52:31	Scruffy	but the most impressive thing for me was water
2015-11-27 04:52:44	Scruffy	Sorry bosses, but they had nothing on the water
2015-11-27 04:52:54	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 04:53:09	@PikFan	P3 water was much more advanced than P1/2 water
2015-11-27 04:53:15	Scruffy	Oh by far
2015-11-27 04:53:27	@PikFan	it was actually realistic
2015-11-27 04:53:36	Scruffy	Not only calculating realistic waves
2015-11-27 04:53:46	@PikFan	ripples being formed by you, and spreading out, and fading...
2015-11-27 04:54:01	Scruffy	But calculating little light caustics on the underwater surfaces
2015-11-27 04:54:18	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-27 04:54:29	@PikFan	the devs paid exceptional detail
2015-11-27 04:54:55	Scruffy	When you're above water, you see trees reflected. When you use the camera underwater, the water surface actually refracts what's behind it
2015-11-27 04:55:02	Scruffy	That's so crazy
2015-11-27 04:55:45	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 04:56:11	Scruffy	I wonder how they'll top that in P4
2015-11-27 04:56:20	@PikFan	who knows?
2015-11-27 04:56:27	Scruffy	Maybe you'll actually get wet by entering water
2015-11-27 04:56:37	Scruffy	Like, look wet
2015-11-27 04:56:46	Scruffy	and leave drops behind
2015-11-27 04:56:55	Scruffy	They forgot about that
2015-11-27 04:57:02	Scruffy	even though they didn't in Super Mario Sunshine
2015-11-27 04:57:07	@PikFan	they weren't using the full potential of the Wii U's capabilities, so I'm sure they'll top it somehow
2015-11-27 04:57:13	Scruffy	True
2015-11-27 04:57:31	Scruffy	They could have changing water levels
2015-11-27 04:58:07	@PikFan	Zelda U is a far, far bigger game than P3, and Zelda U is apparently the limit to the Wii U's capabilities
2015-11-27 04:58:20	@PikFan	so there's definitely room for improvement
2015-11-27 04:58:39	@PikFan	actually, I like changing water levels
2015-11-27 04:58:55	@PikFan	I was going to have the tides be a gimmick in the Cove of Tranquility
2015-11-27 04:59:18	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 05:00:24	@PikFan	one of the caves will be in the natural sea caves, and they're blocked off to other Pikmin at high tide
2015-11-27 05:00:35	Scruffy	Oooh
2015-11-27 05:00:37	Scruffy	That's cool
2015-11-27 05:00:41	@PikFan	not only that, but the main cove itself will reveal hidden things at low tide
2015-11-27 05:01:05	@PikFan	and I'm thinking that the river will be influenced, too
2015-11-27 05:03:03	Scruffy	Neat
2015-11-27 05:04:19	Scruffy	Will the tides change during the day? Or only between days
2015-11-27 05:05:45	@PikFan	during the day
2015-11-27 05:05:51	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-27 05:05:53	@PikFan	more realistic that way
2015-11-27 05:06:01	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 05:06:11	Scruffy	Hmmmm
2015-11-27 05:06:27	Scruffy	Since you have an optional night mode unlocked in the game
2015-11-27 05:06:37	Scruffy	Would there be changes that obviously happen overnight?
2015-11-27 05:06:43	@PikFan	yep
2015-11-27 05:06:49	Scruffy	Oooh
2015-11-27 05:07:16	Scruffy	That's one thing about Pikmin so far that's weird: everything stays how you left it
2015-11-27 05:07:35	@PikFan	from my knowledge of tides, there are two periods of high tide and two periods of low tide in one day
2015-11-27 05:07:35	Scruffy	Easier to understand, but not very natural
2015-11-27 05:07:40	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 05:07:42	Scruffy	mhmm
2015-11-27 05:10:53	Scruffy	oh, I have to get going
2015-11-27 05:11:00	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-27 05:11:11	Scruffy	Have a good night!
2015-11-27 05:11:13	@PikFan	I'll probably be on tomorrow, but I'm not sure when
2015-11-27 05:11:18	Scruffy	Me too
2015-11-27 05:11:18	@PikFan	yeah, you too
2015-11-27 05:11:19	@PikFan	night
2015-11-27 05:11:27	Scruffy	and happy thanksgiving

2015-11-27 13:23:04	Klemen702	i'm gonna try a game called Stepmania
2015-11-27 13:24:35	Yoshi2	mhm, I used to play that game a while ago
2015-11-27 13:30:52	Klemen702	i hate how a laptop cuts the up and down arrow in half and places them near each other
2015-11-27 13:31:01	Klemen702	makes it harder to play
2015-11-27 13:33:47	Yoshi2	it becomes even more fun when you need to press three of your arrow buttons at once
2015-11-27 13:34:08	Yoshi2	because the computer might not register those button presses
2015-11-27 13:36:07	Klemen702	luckily i don't have that problem
2015-11-27 13:36:40	Klemen702	had to do it on a game before and i could use all 4 arrow EXIM buttons (don't ask about the controls....)
2015-11-27 13:37:41	Klemen702	4 EXIM*
2015-11-27 13:42:12	Klemen702	switched the key config to wasd...

2015-11-27 19:14:49	Yoshi2	nothing better to do than hijack the wiki when it really has no place on the internet anymore
2015-11-27 19:15:41	Klemen702	*AeroBlaze makes serious comment* *makes a reply to a random message instead*
2015-11-27 19:15:56	Klemen702	well
2015-11-27 19:15:59	Klemen702	i don't see much to respond
2015-11-27 19:16:00	Klemen702	but still
2015-11-27 19:16:32	Klemen702	it makes me wonder if she reads what the people trying to get others to move here say
2015-11-27 19:17:02	@Espyo	"geez i never knew this wiki existed honestly."
2015-11-27 19:17:08	@Espyo	I have a feeling he's actually referring to Pikipedia
2015-11-27 19:17:13	@Espyo	I'd laugh my pants off if that was the case
2015-11-27 19:17:24	Klemen702	i don't see anything funny
2015-11-27 19:17:57	@Espyo	she's saying "Welcome :)" as if the guy got introduced to the wikia
2015-11-27 19:18:01	@Espyo	when in fact our message introduced him to Pikipedia
2015-11-27 19:18:12	@Espyo	and she's just saying welcome wrongly
2015-11-27 19:18:18	@Espyo	anyway, WHAT http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Louie?curid=2217&diff=116440&oldid=115886

2015-11-27 19:19:52	Yoshi2	Espyo: I can totally see a way of getting around the ban on talking about our pikipedia
2015-11-27 19:20:08	Yoshi2	ask them on wikia about whether they can be contacted outside of wikia
2015-11-27 19:20:26	Yoshi2	THEN tell them about pikipedia
2015-11-27 19:20:38	@Espyo	the person who did that would eventually get banned because they're not contributing, they're just asking people for contact information
2015-11-27 19:20:53	Yoshi2	good point
2015-11-27 19:20:55	@Espyo	and apparently wikia now won a liking to this wiki in particular, who knows why
2015-11-27 19:20:58	@Espyo	so they'd keep an eye out
2015-11-27 19:21:06	@Espyo	still, only good editors interest us
2015-11-27 19:21:10	@Espyo	I mean... look at that edit I linked
2015-11-27 19:21:14	@Espyo	that guy can STAY on wikia, please
2015-11-27 19:21:17	Yoshi2	hm yes
2015-11-27 19:21:24	@Espyo	but good editors probably also have a twitter account or something, and link to it
2015-11-27 19:21:30	@Espyo	and from there, it's simple
2015-11-27 19:23:08	Yoshi2	with wikia taking a more aggressive stance on this, keeping activity on the wiki to zero will probably not be avoidable

2015-11-27 19:25:52	@Espyo	that's a given

2015-11-27 19:38:41	Klemen702	isn't Esypo around 19 years?
2015-11-27 19:38:46	@Espyo	makes more sense to say how long I've been an editor
2015-11-27 19:38:48	Klemen702	atleast that's how i imagine him
2015-11-27 19:38:54	@Espyo	Klemen702: turned 24 3 days ago
2015-11-27 19:39:02	@J	happy birthday I guess
2015-11-27 19:39:03	Klemen702	not close enough
2015-11-27 19:39:06	@Espyo	heh, thanks
2015-11-27 19:39:13	Klemen702	same here
2015-11-27 19:39:16	Klemen702	happy late birthday
2015-11-27 19:39:18	@Espyo	thanks
2015-11-27 19:39:21	@Espyo	well, ever since I turned like what, 18, 19?
2015-11-27 19:39:25	@Espyo	my age has always been a blur
2015-11-27 19:39:27	@Espyo	I feel just the same
2015-11-27 19:39:28	@J	same
2015-11-27 19:39:33	@Espyo	age really is a number
2015-11-27 19:39:34	@Espyo	at least for now
2015-11-27 19:39:36	@J	I just spent a minute second-guessing my age
2015-11-27 19:39:36	@Espyo	feels nice
2015-11-27 19:39:39	@J	had to calculate it
2015-11-27 19:39:46	@Espyo	happens to me all too often too
2015-11-27 19:40:01	@Espyo	"oh me? I'm twenty-... uh... of-of course I know my age!"
2015-11-27 19:41:34	Klemen702	mental age matters more than actual age
2015-11-27 19:41:44	Klemen702	in my opinion
2015-11-27 19:42:33	Yoshi2	to some extent
2015-11-27 19:43:03	Klemen702	ye
2015-11-27 19:43:19	Klemen702	i ignored laws like the age for drinking or driving there

2015-11-27 19:46:22	@Espyo	but then again, it's such a common glitch, that it's really a matter of happening to be recording when it happened
2015-11-27 19:46:33	@Espyo	Yoshi2: a glitch where it says you have more on your army than there are on the area
2015-11-27 19:46:36	Klemen702	i was actually being sarcastic

2015-11-27 20:02:02	@Espyo	Nintendo's like gunpowder
2015-11-27 20:02:39	Klemen702	from the last nominate''I absolutely cannot allow any Pikmin dying and I get really upset when it happens. I immediately hammer on the reset button when a Pikmin dies. ''
2015-11-27 20:02:55	Klemen702	i think the reset button shoudn't be killed either

2015-11-27 20:05:54	@Espyo	I think we did that already

2015-11-27 20:06:08	Klemen702	also yes
2015-11-27 20:06:24	Klemen702	pikmin fps would bring all the kiddies we need
2015-11-27 20:06:56	Yoshi2	actually
2015-11-27 20:07:06	Yoshi2	a first-person pikmin arena shooter could be nice

2015-11-27 21:53:52	Scruffy	I've finished Chapter 1
2015-11-27 21:53:58	@PikFan	awesome!
2015-11-27 21:54:04	Scruffy	And figured out how it's going to be organized
2015-11-27 21:54:20	Scruffy	It'll alternate between "chapters" and "records"
2015-11-27 21:54:26	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-27 21:54:31	Scruffy	Chapters are his history, and are longer
2015-11-27 21:54:47	Scruffy	Records are logs of his current life on Pnf-404
2015-11-27 21:54:52	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-27 21:55:43	Scruffy	Records will be a lot shorter, but still have a hidden connection to the story
2015-11-27 21:55:49	@PikFan	right
2015-11-27 21:55:58	Scruffy	And Louie has more than one dark secret
2015-11-27 21:56:24	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-27 21:56:26	@PikFan	fascinating
2015-11-27 21:56:50	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 21:58:05	Scruffy	I can't post it right now, but I was wondering if I could pastebin it to you before I post it
2015-11-27 21:58:14	@PikFan	sure, go ahead
2015-11-27 21:58:20	Scruffy	Ok
2015-11-27 21:58:24	Scruffy	Just give me a moment
2015-11-27 21:58:52	@PikFan	alright

2015-11-27 22:06:43	@PikFan	"Anyway, sorry, anyway,"
2015-11-27 22:08:02	Scruffy	Oops
2015-11-27 22:08:28	Scruffy	Man, thank you. I knew I couldn't trust my own proofreading
2015-11-27 22:08:53	@PikFan	hehe
2015-11-27 22:11:43	@PikFan	Louie, how could you
2015-11-27 22:11:59	Scruffy	heh
2015-11-27 22:12:02	Scruffy	What do you think?
2015-11-27 22:12:06	@PikFan	well, this isn't the first time I've read something about Louie almost wanting to eat a Pikmin
2015-11-27 22:12:14	@PikFan	I think it's good
2015-11-27 22:12:55	Scruffy	I just feel like, based on how he's characterized as always wanting to try the animals and bake the berry treasures in pies
2015-11-27 22:13:05	Scruffy	He's sort of guided by his stomach
2015-11-27 22:13:15	Scruffy	Or, his tongue
2015-11-27 22:13:24	Scruffy	Not so much hunger, as wanting to explore flavor
2015-11-27 22:13:32	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-27 22:13:45	Scruffy	But yeah, he at least has a moral code
2015-11-27 22:14:46	Scruffy	I don't think any of the records will be as dark as that one
2015-11-27 22:14:53	Scruffy	Sorry the whole thing is a little on the dark side
2015-11-27 22:15:20	@PikFan	no, no, I like dark things
2015-11-27 22:15:37	Scruffy	But I will at least include a record where he tells you how to cook enemies that were exclusive to P3
2015-11-27 22:16:32	Scruffy	And one where he describes extra behavioral things about enemies that Olimar doesn't mention in his notes
2015-11-27 22:16:54	Scruffy	Louie's got a lot to say
2015-11-27 22:17:32	@PikFan	yessss
2015-11-27 22:17:51	Scruffy	:)
2015-11-27 22:18:12	Scruffy	Anyway, I'm going to post this, thank you so much for reading over it
2015-11-27 22:18:30	Scruffy	Should I put it on Pikmin Fanon as well? And where?
2015-11-27 22:23:11	@PikFan	on a subpage of your userspace, for now
2015-11-27 22:23:29	@PikFan	I need to figure out how to organize stories on the mainspace
2015-11-27 22:23:54	@PikFan	sorry, I was getting out my Christmas tree

2015-11-27 22:39:59	@PikFan	a DeathSpiked Burrowing Snagret, huh
2015-11-27 22:40:21	@PikFan	should be interesting
2015-11-27 22:43:40	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-27 22:43:45	Scruffy	I have no idea though
2015-11-27 22:43:51	Scruffy	I have the Burrowing Snagret
2015-11-27 22:44:05	Scruffy	But the DeathSpiked Dwarf Bulborb was hard enough
2015-11-27 22:44:07	Scruffy	I have to go

2015-11-28 03:59:29	Scruffy	Hi
2015-11-28 04:00:12	Scruffy	Even during Thanksgiving break I can't find much time to come on here
2015-11-28 04:00:18	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-28 04:00:29	@PikFan	that busy, huh?
2015-11-28 04:00:45	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-28 04:00:55	@PikFan	ouch
2015-11-28 04:01:04	@PikFan	okay, so
2015-11-28 04:01:09	Scruffy	I mean, the work is fun/interesting
2015-11-28 04:01:11	Scruffy	It's just a lot
2015-11-28 04:01:18	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-28 04:01:24	Scruffy	oh, sorry for interrupting
2015-11-28 04:01:28	Scruffy	you were saying?
2015-11-28 04:01:33	@PikFan	remember how I was ranting about the NX some time ago?
2015-11-28 04:01:36	Scruffy	yes
2015-11-28 04:01:52	@PikFan	I made a thread about it http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/thread/116/nx-release-date
2015-11-28 04:02:22	@PikFan	because I read a Forbes article today and, unsuprisingly, it was insisting that the NX will launch next year
2015-11-28 04:02:27	@PikFan	which is stupid
2015-11-28 04:03:19	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-28 04:03:35	@PikFan	I dunno, reading that article set me off
2015-11-28 04:03:49	@PikFan	and the forums were the perfect place to rant about it
2015-11-28 04:03:54	Scruffy	Definitely
2015-11-28 04:03:57	Scruffy	I agree with you
2015-11-28 04:04:09	Scruffy	2016 is too soon to release a new product
2015-11-28 04:04:13	Scruffy	console*
2015-11-28 04:04:17	@PikFan	oh, indeed
2015-11-28 04:04:36	@PikFan	and usually with Nintendo consoles, they're launched the year after they're revealed
2015-11-28 04:04:53	@PikFan	so why should NX be any different, even if the Wii U is struggling?
2015-11-28 04:05:05	@PikFan	that's how I perceive it
2015-11-28 04:06:10	Scruffy	I don't feel that Nintendo thinks the Wii U is struggling
2015-11-28 04:06:25	@PikFan	well, they probably don't
2015-11-28 04:06:27	@PikFan	maybe
2015-11-28 04:06:33	Scruffy	Or at least, I saw an interview with Charles Martinet and it made me feel that way
2015-11-28 04:06:44	@PikFan	lots of people outside Nintendo think it's struggling
2015-11-28 04:07:02	Scruffy	Well
2015-11-28 04:07:11	Scruffy	I feel it still has a long life ahead of it
2015-11-28 04:07:19	@PikFan	sure
2015-11-28 04:07:29	@PikFan	I mean, it's not as bad as it could be
2015-11-28 04:07:29	Scruffy	And no matter what people say, I'll still play their installments of classic genres
2015-11-28 04:07:32	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-28 04:07:34	@PikFan	10 million is still a lot
2015-11-28 04:07:38	Scruffy	Indeed
2015-11-28 04:07:53	@PikFan	but compared to the other consoles...
2015-11-28 04:08:34	@PikFan	even to the GameCube, which sold only 22 million units
2015-11-28 04:08:43	@PikFan	well, who knows
2015-11-28 04:08:53	@PikFan	we're only halfway through the Wii U's life
2015-11-28 04:09:06	Scruffy	I think they need to market the Wii U's shop more
2015-11-28 04:09:11	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-11-28 04:09:14	Scruffy	It has all sorts of classic games on it
2015-11-28 04:09:15	@PikFan	agreed
2015-11-28 04:09:23	Scruffy	Plus now it has Pikmin 3
2015-11-28 04:09:28	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-28 04:09:37	@PikFan	Pikmin 3 is more of a niche title, sadly...
2015-11-28 04:09:44	Scruffy	niche?
2015-11-28 04:10:13	@PikFan	compared to other major Nintendo franchises, Pikmin is a niche series
2015-11-28 04:10:17	@PikFan	sadly...
2015-11-28 04:10:33	@PikFan	...just realized I said "sadly...
2015-11-28 04:10:36	@PikFan	twice
2015-11-28 04:10:37	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-28 04:10:38	@PikFan	enter
2015-11-28 04:10:51	Scruffy	I mean what do you mean by niche
2015-11-28 04:11:51	@PikFan	wait, niche isn't the right word
2015-11-28 04:12:16	@PikFan	well, really, what I mean is that it doesn't sell as much as other franchises
2015-11-28 04:12:30	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-28 04:12:36	Scruffy	An underdog?
2015-11-28 04:12:47	Scruffy	Well, not really that either
2015-11-28 04:12:50	Scruffy	An underground game
2015-11-28 04:13:04	Scruffy	Fewer people have heard of it
2015-11-28 04:15:12	@PikFan	right
2015-11-28 04:15:24	@PikFan	er, anyway, about the Wii U
2015-11-28 04:15:32	@PikFan	marketing is a big issue
2015-11-28 04:15:43	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-28 04:15:52	@PikFan	they didn
2015-11-28 04:15:58	@PikFan	didn't push the marketing much
2015-11-28 04:16:23	Scruffy	trure
2015-11-28 04:16:25	Scruffy	true*
2015-11-28 04:16:32	Scruffy	Not nearly as much as the Wii
2015-11-28 04:16:49	Scruffy	I never heard the end of those commercials about Mario Galaxy and Mario Kart Wii
2015-11-28 04:16:53	Scruffy	They were so enticing
2015-11-28 04:17:07	@PikFan	I loved the Wii commericals
2015-11-28 04:17:12	@PikFan	"Wii would like to play."
2015-11-28 04:17:16	Scruffy	Yessss
2015-11-28 04:17:27	Scruffy	I loved the bowing i's
2015-11-28 04:17:40	@PikFan	I actually saw Wii commericals on TV
2015-11-28 04:17:41	Scruffy	the Wii U just has a pulsing U
2015-11-28 04:17:45	Scruffy	Me too
2015-11-28 04:18:00	Scruffy	I saw Pikmin 3 on TV occasionally
2015-11-28 04:18:07	Scruffy	And freaked out, of course
2015-11-28 04:18:10	@PikFan	I didn't...
2015-11-28 04:18:51	Scruffy	it was the commercial with hundreds of Pikmin climbing down from whatever they were doing to take on a Peckish Aristocrab
2015-11-28 04:19:04	Scruffy	And there was an average kid with a whistle directing them
2015-11-28 04:19:19	Scruffy	Which didn't make much sense to me, the kid would tower over all of them
2015-11-28 04:19:46	Scruffy	But then again, the US commercial for Pikmin 2 made even less sense, and I never saw that one
2015-11-28 04:21:04	Scruffy	It was interesting watching different commercials for Pikmin 2 and Pikmin 3 based on region
2015-11-28 04:21:20	@PikFan	"Hot dog! Hot dog! Hot dog!"
2015-11-28 04:21:30	@PikFan	that one was funny, I thought
2015-11-28 04:21:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-28 04:21:48	Scruffy	And weird
2015-11-28 04:21:52	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-28 04:21:59	Scruffy	It certainly gets your attention
2015-11-28 04:22:01	@PikFan	but that's why I liked it
2015-11-28 04:22:07	@PikFan	it was very zany
2015-11-28 04:22:13	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-28 04:23:55	@PikFan	oh, did you hear about Li-Fi?
2015-11-28 04:24:09	Scruffy	no, what's that?
2015-11-28 04:24:18	@PikFan	well
2015-11-28 04:24:25	@PikFan	it's an evolution of Wi-Fi
2015-11-28 04:24:39	@PikFan	and instead of using radio waves to transmit information, it uses visible light
2015-11-28 04:25:03	Scruffy	Woah
2015-11-28 04:25:37	@PikFan	http://www.sciencealert.com/li-fi-tested-in-the-real-world-for-the-first-time-is-100-times-faster-than-wi-fi
2015-11-28 04:25:51	@PikFan	imagine smart lightbulbs that radiate internet
2015-11-28 04:27:14	Scruffy	That's so odd!
2015-11-28 04:27:31	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-28 04:27:32	Scruffy	Like, I know radio can dissipate as it passes through solid objects
2015-11-28 04:27:44	Scruffy	But it's still traveling at the speed of light
2015-11-28 04:27:53	Scruffy	How can visible light carry more data?
2015-11-28 04:28:23	@PikFan	probably because the wavelength is shorter
2015-11-28 04:28:43	Scruffy	True
2015-11-28 04:30:03	Scruffy	This is so magical
2015-11-28 04:30:08	Scruffy	Science is so cool
2015-11-28 04:30:12	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-28 04:31:02	Scruffy	But, if you were to block light between a light source and a computer, would your connection be lost?
2015-11-28 04:31:10	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-28 04:31:13	Scruffy	As in, put your hand in front of it?
2015-11-28 04:31:18	Scruffy	that's an issue
2015-11-28 04:31:34	@PikFan	well, I think the entire source would have to be covered
2015-11-28 04:31:52	@PikFan	as long as SOME light gets away from the source, it should reach the computer
2015-11-28 04:32:01	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-28 04:32:03	@PikFan	since light is bouncy
2015-11-28 04:32:07	Scruffy	Right
2015-11-28 04:32:17	Scruffy	and the lag would only be a few trillionths of a second
2015-11-28 04:32:30	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-28 04:33:02	@PikFan	you only have one or two routers in a house
2015-11-28 04:33:07	Scruffy	The thing is, the computer would need a superaccurate way of measuring light quickly
2015-11-28 04:33:11	@PikFan	but you have a lot more lightbulbs than tha
2015-11-28 04:33:13	@PikFan	*that
2015-11-28 04:33:22	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-11-28 04:33:30	@PikFan	well, I'm sure they'll work it out
2015-11-28 04:33:36	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2015-11-28 04:33:51	@PikFan	the nice thing is that people won't be able to steal your internet anymore
2015-11-28 04:33:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-28 04:34:02	@PikFan	that is, if you're using only Li-Fi
2015-11-28 04:34:06	Scruffy	Unless they turned off the light
2015-11-28 04:34:35	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-28 04:35:03	Scruffy	I feel like using both radio and visible would be safest
2015-11-28 04:35:33	Scruffy	Not security-wise, but it would assure your connection at least
2015-11-28 04:36:02	Scruffy	Heh I'm just imagining
2015-11-28 04:36:08	@PikFan	"Direct line of sight isn't necessary for Li-Fi to transmit a signal; light reflected off the walls can achieve 70 Mbit/s."
2015-11-28 04:36:14	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-28 04:36:16	Scruffy	Wow
2015-11-28 04:36:39	Scruffy	Someone would have an old antique lamp that blinks slowly
2015-11-28 04:36:47	Scruffy	And that would be why their internet is really slow
2015-11-28 04:37:13	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-28 04:38:52	@PikFan	"Li-Fi is expected to be ten times cheaper than Wi-Fi."
2015-11-28 04:38:53	@PikFan	sweet
2015-11-28 04:39:22	Scruffy	This is amazing
2015-11-28 04:40:48	@PikFan	twenty years ago, when the internet was just new, people probably would've thought that internet-emitting lightbulbs couldn't happen
2015-11-28 04:41:03	@PikFan	but now look at us
2015-11-28 04:41:14	@PikFan	I'm always amazed at how fast technology is evolving
2015-11-28 04:42:15	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-28 04:42:30	Scruffy	Eventually wel
2015-11-28 04:42:35	Scruffy	we'll hit the singularity
2015-11-28 04:44:13	Scruffy	But until then, Li-Fi sounds wonderful
2015-11-28 04:44:34	Scruffy	And so convenient that human eyes won't see it happening, so we won't have to live in a flickery mess
2015-11-28 04:47:33	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-28 04:47:59	@PikFan	I'm excited to see what quantum computers are capable of
2015-11-28 04:49:16	Scruffy	Oh, me too
2015-11-28 04:50:04	Scruffy	After seeing how quickly my new solid state hard drive runs
2015-11-28 04:53:38	Scruffy	it runs Blender a little quicker
2015-11-28 04:53:42	Scruffy	which is fancy
2015-11-28 04:54:13	@PikFan	yay
2015-11-28 04:54:41	@PikFan	say, how's that 25 second short coming along?
2015-11-28 04:54:51	Scruffy	Ah, I'm working on that now
2015-11-28 04:54:57	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-28 04:55:16	Scruffy	it's 2/3 complete, and the last third is going faster
2015-11-28 04:55:28	Scruffy	weird to think this thing survived a hard drive failure
2015-11-28 04:55:51	@PikFan	well, I'm just glad it did
2015-11-28 04:55:58	@PikFan	so that your efforts didn't go to waste
2015-11-28 04:56:12	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-28 04:57:28	Scruffy	I'm really happy with how this one looks
2015-11-28 04:57:37	Scruffy	it turned out quite nice
2015-11-28 04:58:18	@PikFan	awesome
2015-11-28 04:58:59	Scruffy	I might have it done by the end of the weekend, but that depends how much time i can keep my laptop rendering
2015-11-28 04:59:12	Scruffy	I don't want to leave it running too long
2015-11-28 04:59:14	@PikFan	I see

2015-11-28 15:28:49	Scruffy	Hey Espyo, I've discovered a little more science
2015-11-28 15:28:57	@Espyo	ooh?
2015-11-28 15:29:25	Scruffy	if a master Onion has two types of Pikmin to produce, it will never mix transactions
2015-11-28 15:29:34	Scruffy	it's always first Pikmin first, then second Pikmin
2015-11-28 15:29:38	Scruffy	it has a queue
2015-11-28 15:29:54	Scruffy	I first discovered this in Bingo Battle
2015-11-28 15:30:12	Scruffy	First Purple Pikmin got a 5 pellet, then Yellow Pikmin got a bulborb in the Blooming Terrace
2015-11-28 15:30:26	Scruffy	The Onion first spouted 3 Purples and then spouted all the Yellow Pikmin
2015-11-28 15:30:35	Scruffy	But it will never produce more than one type at once
2015-11-28 15:31:05	@Espyo	oh, for when it has to spit out seeds because it received food, you mean?
2015-11-28 15:31:43	Scruffy	Right
2015-11-28 15:31:50	@Espyo	neat
2015-11-28 15:31:58	@Espyo	worth a mention somewhere on the [[Onion]] article, I'd say

2015-11-29 19:08:37	Yoyo	I'm just trying to think of what Myamoto is bringing to the table in the 4th installment.
2015-11-29 19:09:06	Yoshi2	I want a first person pikmin adventure
2015-11-29 19:09:45	Yoyo	Like the camera mode in Pikmin 3 but you can move around in it?
2015-11-29 19:10:24	Yoyo	For Miiverse.
2015-11-29 19:10:33	Yoshi2	requires new gameplay though
2015-11-29 19:11:39	Yoyo	And I'm not too sure the Wii U can handle that. Or if the NX would, maybe.
2015-11-29 19:15:38	Yoyo	But yeah, the potions are getting kinda old. At least they could nerf the bitter berries.
2015-11-29 19:17:13	Yoshi2	the wii u can definitely handle first person stuff

2015-11-30 22:50:33	@PikFan	there's 731 articles that are 500 characters long or shorter
2015-11-30 22:52:28	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-30 22:52:44	@PikFan	I need to do something about stories
2015-11-30 22:53:11	@PikFan	most of the creations are games, but there are a couple users who want to write stories, too
2015-11-30 22:53:22	@PikFan	(really, just me and Scruffy, for now)
2015-11-30 22:53:45	@PikFan	but I'm not sure how you'd write stories in the namespace
2015-11-30 22:54:16	@PikFan	*mainspace
2015-11-30 22:54:17	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-30 22:55:37	@Espyo	y-yikes
2015-11-30 22:55:38	@Espyo	 731
2015-11-30 22:56:02	@PikFan	that's one fourth of the wiki
2015-11-30 22:56:04	@PikFan	one fourth
2015-11-30 22:56:08	@PikFan	that's not good
2015-11-30 23:01:26	@PikFan	by the way Espyo
2015-11-30 23:01:29	@PikFan	do you have Splatoon?
2015-11-30 23:01:33	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-30 23:01:37	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-30 23:01:55	@PikFan	well, I found these Splatoon videos and they have a lot of TF2 references in them
2015-11-30 23:01:59	@PikFan	you might like them
2015-11-30 23:02:07	@Espyo	heh, I saw quite a few
2015-11-30 23:03:49	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA5IF9Mp4Ak
2015-11-30 23:05:26	@Espyo	oh hey
2015-11-30 23:05:28	@Espyo	I love this guy
2015-11-30 23:05:32	@Espyo	how am I not subbed yet?
2015-11-30 23:06:12	@PikFan	I don't get the references but his videos are still pretty funny
2015-11-30 23:15:52	@Espyo	ok, guess I'll create the new poll and FA then
2015-11-30 23:16:12	@PikFan	>FA has only 1 vote
2015-11-30 23:19:29	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Featured_article/nominations#100_Pikmin_limit actually...
2015-11-30 23:20:32	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-30 23:20:39	@PikFan	well, I think we can worry about that later
2015-11-30 23:20:44	@PikFan	for now, it's good enough
2015-11-30 23:20:48	@PikFan	it doesn't have to be perfect
2015-11-30 23:20:58	@Espyo	I'd rather we have a juicy article that gives the reader the most bang for their buck
2015-11-30 23:21:10	@PikFan	I do too
2015-11-30 23:21:17	@PikFan	but that's just one detail
2015-11-30 23:21:23	@PikFan	it's already got plenty of details
2015-11-30 23:21:25	@Espyo	there's probably more we can elaborate on
2015-11-30 23:21:34	@PikFan	maybe
2015-11-30 23:21:45	@PikFan	well, we don't have time to worry over it
2015-11-30 23:21:46	@Espyo	the reasons could probably use sources
2015-11-30 23:21:59	@Espyo	if the devs ever, at any point, mentioned that the limit is because of hardware limitations
2015-11-30 23:22:09	@PikFan	then what article do you suggest?
2015-11-30 23:22:11	@Espyo	plus sources for the other two reasons
2015-11-30 23:22:18	@Espyo	I don't know...
2015-11-30 23:22:24	@Espyo	if we can't find anything else, I guess it'll do
2015-11-30 23:22:34	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-30 23:22:39	@Espyo	but if we have something else that's complete, we can save this article for when it's even better
2015-11-30 23:23:15	@Espyo	ultra-spicy spray?
2015-11-30 23:24:21	@PikFan	it's so short...
2015-11-30 23:24:43	@Espyo	has all the info it needs to have
2015-11-30 23:25:08	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-30 23:25:12	@PikFan	maybe
2015-11-30 23:25:19	@PikFan	we could also do [[Spray]]
2015-11-30 23:25:20	Testyo	"Spray" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Spray
2015-11-30 23:25:43	@PikFan	there's an image tag at the bottom, but otherwise it looks good
2015-11-30 23:25:44	@Espyo	oh, I like Spray
2015-11-30 23:25:51	@Espyo	I can take that image in 5 minutes
2015-11-30 23:26:04	@Espyo	I'll nominate Spray then
2015-11-30 23:26:06	@Espyo	unless you want to?
2015-11-30 23:26:14	@PikFan	yeah, you nominate it
2015-11-30 23:26:18	@PikFan	I gotta get going
2015-11-30 23:26:32	@Espyo	all right
2015-11-30 23:26:49	@PikFan	might be on later, not sure

2015-12-01 00:18:10	@PikFan	hey, so I saw that you updated the area preview again
2015-12-01 00:18:17	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2015-12-01 00:18:29	Scruffy	Sorry, I forgot to update your talk page
2015-12-01 00:18:33	Scruffy	What do you think?
2015-12-01 00:18:39	@PikFan	it's purple
2015-12-01 00:18:49	@PikFan	well
2015-12-01 00:19:05	@PikFan	it's like the whole image has been tinted a purplish color
2015-12-01 00:19:08	@PikFan	like lavender
2015-12-01 00:19:12	Scruffy	Yeah...
2015-12-01 00:19:24	Scruffy	I was doing studies of real-life lenses
2015-12-01 00:19:45	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-12-01 00:19:47	Scruffy	But I suppose that one is a little purple for a beach scene
2015-12-01 00:19:54	@PikFan	I agree
2015-12-01 00:20:16	@PikFan	other than that, it looks good
2015-12-01 00:20:29	@PikFan	sorry to be so nitpicky
2015-12-01 00:21:04	Scruffy	No no it's no problem
2015-12-01 00:22:17	Scruffy	I'll do another pass on it
2015-12-01 00:22:24	@PikFan	thanks
2015-12-01 00:23:03	Scruffy	But right now Blender is occupied, I'm in the final stretch
2015-12-01 00:23:17	Scruffy	less than 50 frames left of the short short
2015-12-01 00:23:24	@PikFan	yaaaaay
2015-12-01 00:28:08	Scruffy	This thing has taken over 80 hours
2015-12-01 00:28:16	Scruffy	And lived through a hard drive failure

2015-12-01 00:28:54	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-01 00:30:12	Scruffy	If you were on earlier, did you happen to hear anything from Jpmrocks?
2015-12-01 00:30:19	Scruffy	Apparently he wanted to talk to me
2015-12-01 00:30:26	@PikFan	no, sorry
2015-12-01 00:30:51	@PikFan	he wasn't on when I first got on 2 hours ago
2015-12-01 00:32:01	Scruffy	Oh
2015-12-01 00:32:08	Scruffy	No problem

2015-12-01 00:35:57	Scruffy	oh yeah
2015-12-01 00:36:04	Scruffy	victory is yours
2015-12-01 00:36:06	@PikFan	but yeah, all this is just speculation

2015-12-01 18:53:39	@J	so Wikia
2015-12-01 18:53:59	@J	they protected my talk page, removed my admin rights, and changed my talk page to remove links to Pikipedia
2015-12-01 18:54:16	@J	so I can't even revert it on the grounds that it's my personal talk page
2015-12-01 18:54:32	Yoshi2	rip
2015-12-01 18:55:29	@J	anyway, looks like they're turning all pikminwiki.com links into just plain text, so that search engines don't think Wikia is linking to us
2015-12-01 18:55:34	@J	pretty sad
2015-12-01 18:56:59	Yoshi2	I wonder if we can use that fact as ammunition for convincing future pikmin wikia editors to come to us
2015-12-01 18:58:16	@Espyo	links in talk pages are already...
2015-12-01 18:58:19	@Espyo	uh, nolink, was it?
2015-12-01 18:58:27	@Espyo	the tag that makes search engines not take them into account for tallying links
2015-12-01 18:58:40	@Espyo	oh, we can for sure
2015-12-01 18:58:43	@Espyo	little as it may be
2015-12-01 18:58:47	Yoshi2	hijacking the wiki like that is a pretty dickish thing to do
2015-12-01 18:58:54	@Espyo	I plan on writing a really elaborate document one day
2015-12-01 18:59:04	@Espyo	the mother of all "why leave wikia?" questions
2015-12-01 18:59:06	@Espyo	and add that, too

2015-12-01 18:59:52	@Espyo	if it wasn't clear before

2015-12-01 19:20:25	@J	we can't realistically change the license now, but I'm interested in what you'd like to prevent
2015-12-01 19:20:41	@J	for example, would you add a no-commercial clause to the license?
2015-12-01 19:21:27	@Espyo	at the very least, something that would force people to add something like "source: Pikipedia" at the end of any copied content
2015-12-01 19:21:42	@Espyo	so that if one day, some lunatic decides to take our content, we can at least have some guard
2015-12-01 19:22:22	@Espyo	also, I like how with their activity changing links to Pikipedia, they put one of the forum posts discussing the move back on the list of recently changed pages, on the right sidebar

2015-12-01 23:08:07	@PikFan	things should ease up next week with the start of the new term
2015-12-01 23:09:06	Scruffy	hi

2015-12-01 23:09:18	Scruffy	Yeah, same here
2015-12-01 23:09:28	Scruffy	what finals?
2015-12-01 23:09:43	@PikFan	I have a two day biology final starting tomorrow
2015-12-01 23:09:46	@PikFan	100 questions
2015-12-01 23:10:09	@PikFan	and then I have a final project for English

2015-12-01 23:15:45	Scruffy	You can do it!
2015-12-01 23:16:14	@PikFan	thanks
2015-12-01 23:17:24	@PikFan	gah
2015-12-01 23:17:33	@PikFan	why is {{columns}} giving me grief

2015-12-01 23:17:53	Scruffy	Are you on Pikipedia or Fanon?

2015-12-01 23:18:13	@PikFan	but the third and fourth columns are grouped together
2015-12-01 23:18:34	@PikFan	(Collect Treasure! objects)
2015-12-01 23:18:48	@PikFan	and after Whiptongue Bulborb, this appears: | style="width: 25%; vertical-align: top;" | 
2015-12-01 23:20:08	@PikFan	ok, tried testing out an example fifth column, and that didn't appear
2015-12-01 23:20:28	@PikFan	do things get glitchy when you try to make four columns?
2015-12-01 23:20:35	@PikFan	Espyo
2015-12-01 23:22:56	@PikFan	hmm, I guess the template doesn't like four columns
2015-12-01 23:23:07	@PikFan	ugh
2015-12-01 23:23:23	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2015-12-01 23:23:34	@PikFan	maybe I can try nesting them in one another
2015-12-01 23:24:54	Scruffy	I remember having trouble with columns, I'm not sure how to help
2015-12-01 23:24:57	Scruffy	Oh, hold on

2015-12-01 23:25:38	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-01 23:25:44	@Espyo	I think the limit is 3
2015-12-01 23:25:51	@PikFan	well, I worked around it
2015-12-01 23:25:52	@Espyo	 4 looks crunched on mobile anyway

2015-12-02 00:12:08	Scruffy	I've been trying to fix it

2015-12-02 00:12:32	@PikFan	well thanks, Espyo
2015-12-02 00:12:53	Scruffy	The thing is, since the names are long, they wrap really poorly when squeezed into 3 columbs
2015-12-02 00:12:56	Scruffy	columns*
2015-12-02 00:13:05	Scruffy	I think it might just be best to stick with 2
2015-12-02 00:13:27	@PikFan	though, I'm looking at it on the Wii U, and they're really broken
2015-12-02 00:13:51	Scruffy	Ah
2015-12-02 00:13:53	@PikFan	yeah, 2 columns would probably be better
2015-12-02 00:13:58	Scruffy	They're a lot cleaner that way
2015-12-02 00:14:08	Scruffy	I'll save it and show you how it looks
2015-12-02 00:14:16	@PikFan	ok
2015-12-02 00:14:37	Scruffy	Alright, try reloading the page
2015-12-02 00:15:04	@PikFan	yeah, it's better
2015-12-02 00:15:14	Scruffy	Great
2015-12-02 00:15:22	@PikFan	I was trying to make it not so tall
2015-12-02 00:15:23	Scruffy	So, I guess just go with 2 columns?
2015-12-02 00:15:26	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 00:15:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-02 00:16:34	Scruffy	I can go through and start updating those then
2015-12-02 00:16:58	@PikFan	alright
2015-12-02 00:18:27	@PikFan	so, how do people feel about your video so far?
2015-12-02 00:19:11	Scruffy	Apparently Espyo told me everyone's freaking out
2015-12-02 00:21:00	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-02 00:21:30	@PikFan	would the prologue film be in a similar style to this?
2015-12-02 00:22:32	Scruffy	I'm not sure
2015-12-02 00:22:56	@PikFan	how come?
2015-12-02 00:23:02	Scruffy	All the material I have so far on the prologue uses a less sophisticated renderer than the one I used for that video
2015-12-02 00:23:37	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-02 00:23:38	Scruffy	And as much as I'd like to see it on Cycles, I don't think it'd be done even by the end of this year if I rendered it all with Cycles
2015-12-02 00:24:24	@PikFan	is the prologue film using Blender's internal engine?
2015-12-02 00:24:30	Scruffy	Yes
2015-12-02 00:24:36	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-02 00:24:39	Scruffy	It's faster... at times
2015-12-02 00:24:47	Scruffy	I had to cut a lot of corners
2015-12-02 00:25:06	@PikFan	so then... was Excerpt made with Cycles?
2015-12-02 00:25:12	Scruffy	Yes
2015-12-02 00:25:20	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-02 00:25:22	Scruffy	And I like everything about it more
2015-12-02 00:25:34	Scruffy	I learned more about lighting, rigging, animating, effects
2015-12-02 00:26:03	Scruffy	and then I look back at the prologue material and just want to redo it
2015-12-02 00:26:09	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-02 00:26:37	@PikFan	you think it's that low quality?
2015-12-02 00:26:48	Scruffy	Well, it's ok on its own
2015-12-02 00:27:09	Scruffy	But after posting this video I realized how good I can do, how much better I could make it look
2015-12-02 00:27:18	Scruffy	I could at the very least re-animate it
2015-12-02 00:27:27	Scruffy	There are a few points where I feel too little is going on
2015-12-02 00:27:59	Scruffy	There are always things moving in the Pikmin cutscenes
2015-12-02 00:28:02	@PikFan	you have to reanimate it anyway to fit with the new plot, right?
2015-12-02 00:28:08	Scruffy	Very little
2015-12-02 00:28:18	@PikFan	oh ok
2015-12-02 00:32:24	Scruffy	Yeah, I don't know, either way the prologue is going to be a while
2015-12-02 00:32:55	Scruffy	That's why I wanted to put this out there; I didn't want to build people up with a "big project" and not deliver anything
2015-12-02 00:33:15	@PikFan	right
2015-12-02 00:33:23	@PikFan	it's an appetizer
2015-12-02 00:33:45	@PikFan	it also shows us what you're capable of
2015-12-02 00:33:54	Scruffy	Heh
2015-12-02 00:34:12	Scruffy	And now the prologue should top that
2015-12-02 00:34:26	Scruffy	First I want to see if I can use my college's computer lab to render
2015-12-02 00:34:31	Scruffy	That would speed things up
2015-12-02 00:34:34	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-02 00:34:54	@PikFan	hey, you mentioned render farms last night
2015-12-02 00:34:59	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 00:35:11	@PikFan	what if we volunteered our computers for you?
2015-12-02 00:35:54	Scruffy	I don't think that's how it works
2015-12-02 00:36:07	Scruffy	If you volunteer online, anyone can render a project on your computer

2015-12-02 01:14:43	Scruffy	What's to happen in 6 in 7?
2015-12-02 01:14:45	@PikFan	chapter 6 will focus on getting used to the Winged Pikmin more, and chapter 7 will focus on Ignis' training
2015-12-02 01:14:58	Scruffy	Ah
2015-12-02 01:15:05	@PikFan	Ignis can use Elem, but he can't really control it
2015-12-02 01:15:53	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 01:16:45	Scruffy	So do the reds know how to train him then?

2015-12-02 01:19:36	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-02 01:19:42	Scruffy	But I think I saw some mention of maintenance to be done soon
2015-12-02 01:19:55	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-02 01:23:09	@PikFan	ok, so
2015-12-02 01:23:26	@PikFan	after the attack, the Pikmin decide to head to the capital of the Pikmin Republic
2015-12-02 01:23:38	@PikFan	the journey there will take at least two chapters
2015-12-02 01:23:41	Scruffy	Woah
2015-12-02 01:23:47	@PikFan	probably longer
2015-12-02 01:23:54	Scruffy	Pikmin Republic!

2015-12-02 01:23:56	Scruffy	Where?
2015-12-02 01:24:08	@PikFan	check Chapter 3, Ruby mentions it
2015-12-02 01:24:12	Scruffy	Please feel like being descriptive
2015-12-02 01:24:26	@PikFan	heh, alright
2015-12-02 01:24:46	@PikFan	normally, they'd just fly there in the Onions
2015-12-02 01:24:57	@PikFan	but the Onions get damaged in the attack
2015-12-02 01:25:10	@PikFan	they can fly a little bit, but not much
2015-12-02 01:25:40	Scruffy	Ah
2015-12-02 01:25:51	Scruffy	So they need to go there to get them repaired, and to tell the news?
2015-12-02 01:25:56	@PikFan	yes, exactly
2015-12-02 01:26:00	@PikFan	they have a meeting
2015-12-02 01:26:35	@PikFan	after that point, the crew eventually ends up in the parallel PNF-404
2015-12-02 01:27:53	Scruffy	The red Pikmin crew? or someone from Hocotate/Koppai
2015-12-02 01:28:24	@PikFan	not just the Reds
2015-12-02 01:28:27	@PikFan	all 7 types
2015-12-02 01:28:56	@PikFan	there'll be main characters from all the types
2015-12-02 01:29:11	Scruffy	Wow
2015-12-02 01:29:19	Scruffy	This is a massive story
2015-12-02 01:29:29	@PikFan	oh, it is
2015-12-02 01:29:52	@PikFan	it'll probably be over 20 chapters long by the time it's done
2015-12-02 01:30:01	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 01:30:07	Scruffy	I can't wait
2015-12-02 01:30:11	@PikFan	and if each chapter is around 3k words...
2015-12-02 01:30:25	@PikFan	this will easily become a short novel
2015-12-02 01:30:52	Scruffy	Yeah

2015-12-02 19:12:16	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-02 19:23:30	@Espyo	ok, removing links to the wiki is one thing
2015-12-02 19:23:32	@Espyo	we did it too
2015-12-02 19:23:41	@Espyo	but they actively REMOVED THE TOPICS DISCUSSING IT
2015-12-02 19:24:32	@Espyo	but for some reason kept the "blogs" talking about it
2015-12-02 19:25:20	@Espyo	I think I am too intelligent to comprehend this sort of retardation
2015-12-02 19:25:28	@Espyo	I would say that even if I had a single-digit IQ
2015-12-02 19:25:44	@Espyo	OH
2015-12-02 19:25:47	@Espyo	AND THEY DELETED USER PAGES TOO

2015-12-02 19:28:11	@Espyo	pfft
2015-12-02 19:28:21	@Espyo	maybe a way to combat people walking from wikia to Pikipedia?
2015-12-02 19:28:38	@Espyo	yeah, I bet that over the course of any wiki's lifetime, only one person ever really saw my page and moved out of wikia
2015-12-02 19:28:42	@Espyo	one... or zero
2015-12-02 19:28:51	@Espyo	but no more than one, for sure
2015-12-02 19:29:01	@Espyo	thanks for adding things to our list of reasons to hate you, guys
2015-12-02 19:30:49	Scruffy	Did they give a reason?
2015-12-02 19:32:30	@Espyo	mostly boiled down to "this wiki is staying open and anybody is free to join it"
2015-12-02 19:32:35	@Espyo	that's the reason for closing certain threads
2015-12-02 19:32:38	@Espyo	the ones they didn't delete
2015-12-02 19:33:04	Scruffy	Well that would mean you're free to join it again
2015-12-02 19:33:20	Scruffy	So they can't say "anybody"
2015-12-02 19:33:27	Scruffy	But that's Wikia's motto

2015-12-02 20:13:05	@Espyo	would probably pass in court
2015-12-02 20:13:13	@Espyo	but still got banned
2015-12-02 20:14:09	Scruffy	I had the idea to become a user and edit articles to over-intellectualize the prose
2015-12-02 20:14:31	Scruffy	Since it technically would be /enhancing/ the information the article gives

2015-12-02 22:18:53	@Espyo	but would it really make sense to have two of them?
2015-12-02 22:18:59	@Espyo	I mean, the terrain is the same in both versions of a level
2015-12-02 22:19:02	@Espyo	only the objects change
2015-12-02 22:19:10	@Espyo	well, and subtle terrain changes too here and there, I guess

2015-12-02 22:22:00	Scruffy	hello
2015-12-02 22:22:02	@Espyo	well, better, but still a bit all over the place
2015-12-02 22:22:07	SpiralBlaze	hey
2015-12-02 22:22:11	@PikFan	hi
2015-12-02 22:22:18	Scruffy	Espyo: that's true
2015-12-02 22:22:34	@PikFan	well, it's better than having it be so tall
2015-12-02 22:22:39	Scruffy	but from what I've seen the terrain sections also say how all the objects are organized on the map
2015-12-02 22:23:15	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-02 22:23:21	@Espyo	well, we should at least change the name then
2015-12-02 22:23:24	@Espyo	since it's not so much about terrain
2015-12-02 22:23:29	@Espyo	"layout" is probably the way to go
2015-12-02 22:23:51	Scruffy	Sure!
2015-12-02 22:23:57	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Awakening_Wood#Objects
2015-12-02 22:24:02	@Espyo	I think this list is a bit more organized
2015-12-02 22:24:26	Scruffy	Oh, true
2015-12-02 22:24:32	Scruffy	That's a good way to do it
2015-12-02 22:24:42	@Espyo	it feels like there's an even better way...
2015-12-02 22:24:43	@Espyo	but I got nothing
2015-12-02 22:24:48	Scruffy	I've been doing something similar, although without everything having bullets
2015-12-02 22:24:48	@Espyo	anyway, that way works well under mobile too
2015-12-02 22:24:53	@Espyo	right
2015-12-02 22:25:06	@PikFan	how many of our views are from mobile?
2015-12-02 22:25:15	@Espyo	iunno
2015-12-02 22:25:22	@Espyo	hm, I should check |:

2015-12-02 22:25:52	Scruffy	And also in Mission Mode I've made it so the good things (pikmin, gameplay flora, treasures) are on one side and opponents (enemies, obstacles) are on the other
2015-12-02 22:26:32	@PikFan	oh, als
2015-12-02 22:26:34	@PikFan	*also
2015-12-02 22:26:51	@PikFan	...meh, nevermind
2015-12-02 22:26:52	@Espyo	I think we have a policy

2015-12-02 22:27:13	Scruffy	Oh shoot
2015-12-02 22:27:18	Scruffy	Heh, well that's ok
2015-12-02 22:27:27	Scruffy	Nothing too big to change
2015-12-02 22:27:27	@Espyo	right, there's an order
2015-12-02 22:27:35	@PikFan	still too tall for my liking
2015-12-02 22:27:37	@Espyo	I guess I decided that to put what interest the reader more first
2015-12-02 22:27:43	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 22:27:46	@Espyo	so treasures, because value
2015-12-02 22:27:48	@Espyo	enemies because awareness
2015-12-02 22:27:54	Scruffy	So where would Pikmin go on that list?
2015-12-02 22:27:56	@Espyo	obstacles because well, it's less important, but still gameplay
2015-12-02 22:28:00	@Espyo	and then plants because meh
2015-12-02 22:28:04	@Espyo	Pikmin should be at the top
2015-12-02 22:28:09	@Espyo	they're the main thing, I'd say
2015-12-02 22:28:58	Scruffy	The types of Pikmin you start with
2015-12-02 22:29:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 22:29:36	Scruffy	Ok then, so pikmin, treasures, enemies, obstacles, plants
2015-12-02 22:29:40	@Espyo	oh, the Music section on that list would also be relevant
2015-12-02 22:29:46	Scruffy	yes
2015-12-02 22:29:50	@Espyo	so I guess the list is really "Level information
2015-12-02 22:29:51	@Espyo	*"
2015-12-02 22:29:54	@Espyo	like we have on challenge mode levels
2015-12-02 22:29:56	Scruffy	Although I feel like that should go in the infobox
2015-12-02 22:30:01	@Espyo	same
2015-12-02 22:30:07	Scruffy	Since there's only one "sublevel" to Mission Mode
2015-12-02 22:30:08	@Espyo	but we have to try to avoid to bloat the infobox
2015-12-02 22:30:14	@Espyo	yeah, I get you
2015-12-02 22:30:20	@Espyo	can different versions of the same map have different music?
2015-12-02 22:30:25	Scruffy	No
2015-12-02 22:30:33	@Espyo	I think there's only 3 — the main one, Fortress of Festivity, and DLC
2015-12-02 22:30:36	@Espyo	right, thought so
2015-12-02 22:30:40	@Espyo	guess infobox is the way to go
2015-12-02 22:30:44	@Espyo	Testyo, take me there
2015-12-02 22:30:45	Testyo	probably not enough space for all right, moment of truth
2015-12-02 22:30:45	@PikFan	and then the 1 minute left version
2015-12-02 22:30:50	@Espyo	[[Template:Infobox mission]]
2015-12-02 22:30:51	Testyo	"Template:Infobox_mission" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_mission
2015-12-02 22:31:08	Scruffy	That's a good point PikFan, but I don't think it's as necessary in the infobox
2015-12-02 22:31:24	Scruffy	When people click the music link there's information there about 1 minute left versions
2015-12-02 22:31:24	@PikFan	right, I'm just pointing it out
2015-12-02 22:31:40	Scruffy	Oh, and the boss music for the boss battle levels
2015-12-02 22:31:54	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-02 22:32:03	@Espyo	well, we don't have articles on the boss levels
2015-12-02 22:32:11	Scruffy	including Phosbat jam and Plasm tune
2015-12-02 22:32:16	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2015-12-02 22:32:27	@Espyo	tsk, I forgot that the current mission infobox is already PRETTY bloated
2015-12-02 22:32:34	@Espyo	well, not bloated, but full of stuff
2015-12-02 22:32:45	@Espyo	I could add more, but it'd start to get bloated then
2015-12-02 22:32:48	@Espyo	plus it's one field
2015-12-02 22:32:52	@Espyo	and that infobox is set with two fields
2015-12-02 22:33:05	@Espyo	(two fields per row)
2015-12-02 22:33:10	@Espyo	so it'd look pretty ugly
2015-12-02 22:33:28	Scruffy	You could do the thing you did with eneimes
2015-12-02 22:33:37	Scruffy	And put technical information in its own section
2015-12-02 22:33:47	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-02 22:33:57	Scruffy	Then there you could include things like the world record
2015-12-02 22:34:22	Scruffy	And the local time limit, which is very important
2015-12-02 22:34:22	@Espyo	I think we can restructure the template entirely
2015-12-02 22:34:25	@Espyo	too wordy atm
2015-12-02 22:34:30	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 22:34:32	@Espyo	what if we have one field for the number of Pikmin
2015-12-02 22:34:36	@Espyo	and in it, there's a table
2015-12-02 22:34:41	@Espyo	with icons for the Pikmin, and their numbers below
2015-12-02 22:34:46	@Espyo	and just forget about any Pikmin that aren't there
2015-12-02 22:34:50	Scruffy	And candypop buds
2015-12-02 22:34:55	@Espyo	instead of having a bunch of "bla bla Pikmin | 0" fields
2015-12-02 22:34:59	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-02 22:34:59	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-12-02 22:35:04	@Espyo	like the menu, yeah
2015-12-02 22:35:10	Scruffy	Cool!
2015-12-02 22:35:30	@Espyo	and as for the medal requirements, we can probably forget icons too
2015-12-02 22:35:33	@Espyo	great, now I'm hyped
2015-12-02 22:35:45	Scruffy	hehe
2015-12-02 22:35:47	Scruffy	brb
2015-12-02 22:45:00	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-12-02 22:45:15	@Espyo	does any level have a starting Pikmin of X type AND candypop buds of X type?
2015-12-02 22:45:26	@Espyo	rather, not starting Pikmin, ANY Pikmin
2015-12-02 22:45:35	@Espyo	does any level have Pikmin of type X AND candypop buds of type X?
2015-12-02 22:45:55	@PikFan	you mean that they're the same type?
2015-12-02 22:46:08	@Espyo	yeah

2015-12-02 22:47:04	@Espyo	 12 Whites, 10 Ivory Candypop Buds
2015-12-02 22:47:07	@Espyo	nuts, that poses a problem
2015-12-02 22:47:27	Scruffy	back
2015-12-02 22:47:44	@Espyo	maybe if I don't put candypop bud numbers on the infobox?
2015-12-02 22:48:08	Scruffy	Wait, you'd put the type of bud, but not the number?
2015-12-02 22:48:13	Scruffy	Or just omit buds
2015-12-02 22:48:56	@Espyo	type of bud, no number
2015-12-02 22:49:15	@Espyo	I'm afraid the number will be a bit ambiguous
2015-12-02 22:49:24	@Espyo	is it the number of Pikmin you can create of that type? or the number of buds?
2015-12-02 22:49:28	@Espyo	we know the answer, but will the readers?
2015-12-02 22:50:12	Scruffy	I see
2015-12-02 22:50:22	Scruffy	Yeah, knowing there are buds there is fine
2015-12-02 22:50:45	Scruffy	And then the layout section will describe where they are, which will tell the reader how many there are if they care to know
2015-12-02 22:51:23	@Espyo	yeah

2015-12-02 22:52:45	Scruffy	because if you have all seven types, you don't need buds

2015-12-02 22:55:18	@PikFan	and knowing me, I wouldn't get around to fixing them
2015-12-02 22:55:46	@PikFan	...screw it, I'll leave redirect
2015-12-02 22:55:49	@PikFan	*redirects
2015-12-02 22:56:10	Scruffy	heh
2015-12-02 22:56:48	@Espyo	might as well

2015-12-02 22:58:35	@PikFan	hey, is there a keyboard shortcut for switching tabs?
2015-12-02 22:58:55	@Espyo	Ctrl+Tab
2015-12-02 22:59:04	@Espyo	Ctrl+Shift+Tab to go to the previous one
2015-12-02 22:59:12	@PikFan	thanks
2015-12-02 22:59:19	@Espyo	try it on other programs too
2015-12-02 22:59:23	@Espyo	most programs with tabs have that shortcut
2015-12-02 22:59:23	@PikFan	how about closing a tab?
2015-12-02 22:59:27	@Espyo	Ctrl+W
2015-12-02 22:59:30	@Espyo	or Cltr+F4
2015-12-02 22:59:32	@Espyo	*Ctrl
2015-12-02 22:59:41	@Espyo	reopen a tab you closed with Ctrl+Shift+T
2015-12-02 22:59:46	@Espyo	new tab with Ctrl+T
2015-12-02 22:59:46	@PikFan	wait, I'm on a mac, ugh
2015-12-02 22:59:50	@Espyo	Command then
2015-12-02 22:59:51	@Espyo	same things
2015-12-02 22:59:53	Scruffy	just open a new window and put the windows side by side
2015-12-02 22:59:53	Scruffy	unless you aren't keeping only two tabs open
2015-12-02 23:00:05	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-02 23:00:09	@PikFan	but that doesn't switch the tabs
2015-12-02 23:00:10	@Espyo	loads of useful stuff you can do if you're crafty
2015-12-02 23:00:33	Scruffy	If you have the latest update, El Capitan, you can split the screen into two windows automatically
2015-12-02 23:01:52	Scruffy	on a broader subject, I have trouble seeing the visual layout of a computer program as a "window"
2015-12-02 23:02:11	@Espyo	how so?
2015-12-02 23:02:18	Scruffy	I think "panel" or "frame" would be better

2015-12-02 23:02:36	Scruffy	Window implies that you are looking /through/ something at something in the distance
2015-12-02 23:02:40	@Espyo	hmmm, yeah
2015-12-02 23:02:44	@Espyo	heck, it's just an archaic name
2015-12-02 23:02:50	@Espyo	although frames already do mean something
2015-12-02 23:02:51	Scruffy	yah
2015-12-02 23:02:54	@Espyo	google "frame widget"
2015-12-02 23:02:57	Scruffy	Shoot
2015-12-02 23:03:04	@Espyo	panel too, probably
2015-12-02 23:06:45	Scruffy	hmm
2015-12-02 23:06:45	Scruffy	well it's not my place to reinvent the computer
2015-12-02 23:06:45	Scruffy	not yet
2015-12-02 23:06:45	Scruffy	Oh, also PikFan, just to update you
2015-12-02 23:06:45	Scruffy	Espyo had his user page removed from Wikia today
2015-12-02 23:06:46	Scruffy	Which is pretty insulting
2015-12-02 23:06:47	Testyo	Scruffy is flooding!
2015-12-02 23:06:54	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-12-02 23:06:56	Scruffy	I am?
2015-12-02 23:07:01	@Espyo	eh, you are in his eyes
2015-12-02 23:07:03	@PikFan	wow
2015-12-02 23:07:16	@Espyo	they also deleted old talk pages and blogs about both moves
2015-12-02 23:07:18	@Espyo	so, censoring
2015-12-02 23:07:19	@PikFan	so much for promoting users' choices
2015-12-02 23:09:08	@PikFan	they are such hypocrites
2015-12-02 23:09:39	@PikFan	...time to make an account and start harassing wikia
2015-12-02 23:09:45	@PikFan	well, maybe
2015-12-02 23:10:30	Scruffy	I was considering doing that and actually making the articles /too/ intelligible
2015-12-02 23:10:50	Scruffy	Thereby not worsening the articles but just confusing them
2015-12-02 23:10:55	@PikFan	with too many big words?
2015-12-02 23:10:56	@Espyo	save your breath
2015-12-02 23:11:00	@Espyo	plus, it'll give us a bad image
2015-12-02 23:11:05	@Espyo	AND bring more attention to that wiki
2015-12-02 23:11:07	Scruffy	But yeah, it's not worth it
2015-12-02 23:11:19	Scruffy	Underhanded, short-lived
2015-12-02 23:11:26	@PikFan	but I can't stand by and let them get away with this treason
2015-12-02 23:11:51	@Espyo	not really treason, just dickheadery
2015-12-02 23:11:59	Scruffy	But come pikmin 4 Pikipedia will be such a bright beacon of info it'll cure their blindness
2015-12-02 23:12:08	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-02 23:12:11	Scruffy	And they'll swarm like moths
2015-12-02 23:12:15	@Espyo	plus we'll advertise the wiki everywhere
2015-12-02 23:12:21	Scruffy	Yeh
2015-12-02 23:12:22	@Espyo	only those who live under a rock will go on wikia
2015-12-02 23:12:22	@J	other common shortcuts for changing tabs are: ctrl+pageup/pagedown, alt+number, alt+left/right, gt/gT /trivia
2015-12-02 23:12:35	Scruffy	"Need help with Pikmin 4? Visit Pikipedia!"
2015-12-02 23:12:40	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-12-02 23:12:50	@Espyo	I THINK I saw ctrl+left/right too
2015-12-02 23:13:03	@Espyo	oh, ctrl+number works on Firefox too
2015-12-02 23:13:28	@J	here, it's alt+number for Firefox
2015-12-02 23:13:29	@Espyo	can't believe it's taking me longer to write a name for this screenshot than what it took to take the screenshot in the first place
2015-12-02 23:13:37	@J	maybe ctrl is more Windowsy
2015-12-02 23:13:41	Scruffy	hmm, on Chrome (on a mac) command+arrow key goes back/forward
2015-12-02 23:13:50	Scruffy	What is the screenshot of?
2015-12-02 23:13:53	@Espyo	you sure? I could swear I accidentally pressed ctrl+number on Firefox a few days ago, at work, and it changed tabs
2015-12-02 23:14:05	@PikFan	ok, so what exactly did wikia do?
2015-12-02 23:14:06	@Espyo	that's the worst part, it's just a screenshot of the infobox
2015-12-02 23:14:09	@Espyo	I don't need a good name for this
2015-12-02 23:14:10	@Espyo	blegh
2015-12-02 23:14:32	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/infobox%20w%20stuff.png
2015-12-02 23:14:36	@J	yeah, definitely alt on a new profile
2015-12-02 23:14:44	Scruffy	just name it "minfoprototype"
2015-12-02 23:14:45	@Espyo	hm, guess I was wrong
2015-12-02 23:15:10	@Espyo	PikFan: wikia deleted old talk and blog pages that discussed both the first move and the one from last year, and deleted my user page
2015-12-02 23:15:11	@PikFan	hey, I like it
2015-12-02 23:15:36	@Espyo	the infobox seems cosy, but I think it's slightly off
2015-12-02 23:15:39	@J	and they removed old admins, and protected my talk page
2015-12-02 23:15:41	Scruffy	nice job on the p3 icons
2015-12-02 23:16:02	Scruffy	Wait, they protected it? Can you still edit it?
2015-12-02 23:16:16	@J	nope
2015-12-02 23:16:20	@Espyo	just found them in the game's files lying around
2015-12-02 23:16:24	@Espyo	does your profile link to Pikipedia?
2015-12-02 23:16:32	@J	don't think so
2015-12-02 23:16:40	@Espyo	wouldn't surprise me if it did, and they kept it
2015-12-02 23:16:43	@Espyo	they don't know what they're doing
2015-12-02 23:16:46	@Espyo	they're so bad at damage control
2015-12-02 23:16:49	Scruffy	So they're just hold ing it hostage
2015-12-02 23:17:05	Scruffy	Yeah, they're news board still has a link to info on the second move
2015-12-02 23:17:06	@Espyo	that's like holding a bag of rice hostage
2015-12-02 23:17:08	Scruffy	their*
2015-12-02 23:17:12	Scruffy	Hehe
2015-12-02 23:17:15	@Espyo	hah
2015-12-02 23:20:37	Scruffy	Hey Esypo, I was wondering if P3's files say anything about a health system for the Plasm Wraith
2015-12-02 23:20:49	Scruffy	Like, how much gold it has to give
2015-12-02 23:20:58	@Espyo	hm, they might say a lot of info
2015-12-02 23:21:02	@Espyo	I'll check after this
2015-12-02 23:23:06	@PikFan	"You will spend all your time working at Pikipedia so that nature will take its course, via internet search engines."
2015-12-02 23:23:08	@PikFan	ahahaha no
2015-12-02 23:23:12	@PikFan	lies
2015-12-02 23:23:23	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-02 23:23:49	@PikFan	they KNOW that we won't be first in search results
2015-12-02 23:23:53	@Espyo	guh, can't really find info on mobile users on Pikipedia
2015-12-02 23:23:57	@Espyo	we are on some searches
2015-12-02 23:23:59	@PikFan	I hate that they're taunting us
2015-12-02 23:24:28	@PikFan	ok, I gotta go
2015-12-02 23:24:34	Scruffy	See ya
2015-12-02 23:24:36	@PikFan	have to catch the bus
2015-12-02 23:24:37	@PikFan	bye

2015-12-02 23:34:58	@Espyo	well, if I check the browser stats, it says mobile is like 1% of users
2015-12-02 23:35:04	@Espyo	well, the mobile browsers
2015-12-02 23:35:13	@Espyo	but if I check by operative system
2015-12-02 23:35:24	@Espyo	iOS + Android = 35%
2015-12-02 23:35:25	@Espyo	a third
2015-12-02 23:35:45	Scruffy	Wow
2015-12-03 00:02:36	@Espyo	wow
2015-12-03 00:02:40	@Espyo	 10 years since the original wiki was created

2015-12-03 18:52:28	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-12-03 18:52:29	Testyo	if you have a laptop, that'd be a great time to it, I think you're overcomplicating
2015-12-03 18:52:56	ScruffyChat	Hey Espyo
2015-12-03 18:53:02	ScruffyChat	And Testyo
2015-12-03 18:53:03	Testyo	it's not like that stuff implies the opposite happens
2015-12-03 18:54:45	ScruffyChat	Espyo I wanted to ask
2015-12-03 18:55:27	ScruffyChat	You've been putting up the stub templates on the Mission Mode stages saying to add an Overview and Key sections sections to the articles
2015-12-03 18:56:12	ScruffyChat	Overview can describe both versions of a stage, but should there be two Key Sections, one for Collect Treasure and one for Defeat Enemies?
2015-12-03 18:56:46	ScruffyChat	Or should both versions be in a table so you can see the differences?
2015-12-03 18:57:47	ScruffyChat	And, should Overview and Key Sections replace Layout? They seem to have the same info, and Layout isn't in the area policy
2015-12-03 19:00:38	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-03 19:00:57	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-03 19:01:03	@Espyo	not really sure what would be best
2015-12-03 19:01:08	@Espyo	honestly, anything that just looks nice
2015-12-03 19:01:15	@Espyo	I think now we just experiment, really
2015-12-03 19:01:18	@Espyo	but that's low priority
2015-12-03 19:01:27	@Espyo	heck, we've got area articles that don't even have their policy
2015-12-03 19:01:29	@Espyo	much less Mission Mode
2015-12-03 19:01:38	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-12-03 19:01:40	@Espyo	I'm basing myself off of the area policy
2015-12-03 19:01:51	@Espyo	so overview would detail how big the stage is, what theme, how vertical, if it has many walls, etc.
2015-12-03 19:01:57	@Espyo	and then layout would detail like what you have
2015-12-03 19:02:03	@Espyo	probably no need for key sections, really
2015-12-03 19:02:03	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-12-03 19:02:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah...
2015-12-03 19:02:10	@Espyo	the levels are small and... well, not that important
2015-12-03 19:02:23	ScruffyChat	Although key sections is a cool way to organize it
2015-12-03 19:02:27	@Espyo	like, if I tell you about the Armored Mawdad arena, you know exactly all about it
2015-12-03 19:02:29	ScruffyChat	Especially if we had images for each one
2015-12-03 19:02:32	@Espyo	but if I tell you about the... lake in Silver Lake
2015-12-03 19:02:34	@Espyo	that's more... meh
2015-12-03 19:02:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-03 19:02:47	@Espyo	again, experimentation
2015-12-03 19:02:49	ScruffyChat	I got ya
2015-12-03 19:02:52	ScruffyChat	Mhm
2015-12-03 19:03:31	ScruffyChat	But yeah, for the regular areas, it'd be cool to have images for each key section in the key sections part
2015-12-03 19:03:39	@Espyo	mhm, mhm
2015-12-03 19:03:52	ScruffyChat	I don't have access to my Wii U at the moment, but I could do that for P1 and P2 if that's important
2015-12-03 19:04:00	@Espyo	not really that important
2015-12-03 19:04:03	@Espyo	but it'd be nice to have
2015-12-03 19:04:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-03 19:04:12	ScruffyChat	The images might already be here
2015-12-03 19:04:33	@Espyo	some, yeah
2015-12-03 19:04:40	ScruffyChat	Right now there's just Layout and Points of interest
2015-12-03 19:05:31	@Espyo	oh wait, I did go through a photo binge through Pikmin one day
2015-12-03 19:05:37	@Espyo	[[The Distant Spring#Gallery]]

2015-12-03 19:06:14	ScruffyChat	Nice
2015-12-03 19:06:33	ScruffyChat	It would sort of diminish the gallery to assign all those to key sections
2015-12-03 19:06:59	ScruffyChat	But I think it'd certainly help viewers understand the area better
2015-12-03 19:07:07	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-12-03 19:07:13	@Espyo	a gallery on the key sections section?
2015-12-03 19:07:37	ScruffyChat	I mean one image per key section
2015-12-03 19:07:47	ScruffyChat	Preferably a bird's eye view
2015-12-03 19:08:23	ScruffyChat	It's like dividing the area into a grid
2015-12-03 19:08:45	ScruffyChat	Except throwing out the squares with nothing of interest in them
2015-12-03 19:10:14	@Espyo	might be too crowded
2015-12-03 19:10:23	ScruffyChat	True
2015-12-03 19:10:34	@Espyo	worth a shot, though
2015-12-03 19:10:47	@Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:23781 meanwhile, they're trying to revive the wiki
2015-12-03 19:10:54	@Espyo	good thing that rrabit doesn't know anything about Pikmin
2015-12-03 19:11:13	@Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Large-Mouth_Wollywog?curid=13231&diff=116519&oldid=116329 lol
2015-12-03 19:11:19	@Espyo	I like how he's trying to show that he's good
2015-12-03 19:11:25	@Espyo	by editing probably the least seen article in the world
2015-12-03 19:11:29	@Espyo	with a change that changes nothing
2015-12-03 19:11:52	ScruffyChat	"Let's look again at the situation in the new year, so that RRabbit has been helping out for a month or so.  Then I'll look again at the situation."
2015-12-03 19:12:07	@Espyo	I didn't even understand that
2015-12-03 19:12:07	ScruffyChat	Good thing they'll look again at the situation
2015-12-03 19:12:37	ScruffyChat	They're just looking again at the situation
2015-12-03 19:13:18	@Espyo	ye
2015-12-03 19:14:31	ScruffyChat	Is there a page with all the fruit icons on it?
2015-12-03 19:15:28	@Espyo	[[Fruit]]

2015-12-03 19:15:32	@Espyo	simple, eh?
2015-12-03 19:15:55	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-12-03 19:16:03	ScruffyChat	I had the idea to download the icons
2015-12-03 19:16:14	ScruffyChat	Because your HD maps of the areas are so great
2015-12-03 19:16:24	ScruffyChat	It'd be easy to make a custom Mission Mode map for thm
2015-12-03 19:16:30	ScruffyChat	And I thought it'd be fun
2015-12-03 19:17:05	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-12-03 19:17:06	@Espyo	nice!
2015-12-03 19:17:07	@Espyo	good luck
2015-12-03 19:17:13	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-12-03 19:17:28	@Espyo	I was working on Pikmin 2 maps
2015-12-03 19:17:34	@Espyo	but suddenly everything jumped into my life at once
2015-12-03 19:17:36	@Espyo	so they're in the backburner
2015-12-03 19:17:43	@Espyo	I'll start them on early January
2015-12-03 19:18:49	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-12-03 20:01:13	ScruffyChat	I made an icon of the Golden Grenade
2015-12-03 20:01:35	ScruffyChat	oh shoot never mind, we had one
2015-12-03 20:03:28	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-03 20:03:41	@Espyo	uhm, check [[:Category:Fruit icons]], come to think of it

2015-12-03 20:04:19	@Espyo	all icons are named like that so that they work with the {{icon}} template

2015-12-03 20:04:23	@Espyo	so if we have it, it has a name like that

2015-12-04 00:07:00	ScruffyChat	This is so exciting! 10 years this has been going on
2015-12-04 00:07:15	ScruffyChat	And I haven't even been on for a year
2015-12-04 00:07:15	@PikFan	indeed
2015-12-04 00:07:24	@PikFan	this year is full of anniversaries
2015-12-04 00:07:33	ScruffyChat	All years are
2015-12-04 00:07:55	@PikFan	we've got the 10 year anniversary since the creation, the 5 year anniversary since the first move, and the 1 year anniversary since the second move
2015-12-04 00:08:03	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-12-04 00:29:09	ScruffyChat	In commemoration, I'm making a special Mission Mode map
2015-12-04 00:29:18	ScruffyChat	Not with Blender, but with Pikipedia icons
2015-12-04 00:29:19	@PikFan	ooh
2015-12-04 00:29:29	ScruffyChat	using the Impact Site
2015-12-04 00:29:45	@PikFan	I look forward to it
2015-12-04 00:29:52	ScruffyChat	And it's a lot of fun designing the puzzle
2015-12-04 00:30:22	ScruffyChat	Makes me really hope there's some sort of game-making mechanic in P4

2015-12-04 01:20:08	@PikFan	I'm still analyzing it
2015-12-04 01:22:10	ScruffyChat	I made sure not to have more than 100 Pikmin, of course
2015-12-04 01:22:17	ScruffyChat	But also no more than 8 types of fruit
2015-12-04 01:22:51	ScruffyChat	Since that's the cap in normal Mission Mode stages
2015-12-04 01:24:10	@PikFan	how much time would you have?
2015-12-04 01:25:26	ScruffyChat	That's the only thing I'm not sure about

2015-12-04 01:26:06	@PikFan	I want to play this now
2015-12-04 01:26:26	ScruffyChat	I knowww, making it only made me want to play it too

2015-12-04 01:28:33	@PikFan	you could take a hiatus from requests so you could focus on Pikmin Forever some more
2015-12-04 01:28:59	@PikFan	I'm not saying you have to, I'm just suggesting
2015-12-04 01:29:16	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-12-04 01:29:35	@PikFan	off-topic, but did they finally fix the wifi?
2015-12-04 01:29:42	ScruffyChat	?
2015-12-04 01:29:52	@PikFan	it was really spotty the other night, remember?

2015-12-04 01:33:20	ScruffyChat	So, I did think of a new gameplay concept for PF today, actually
2015-12-04 01:33:31	@PikFan	nice
2015-12-04 01:33:42	ScruffyChat	It builds off of the idea of choosing where Pikmin carry items
2015-12-04 01:33:42	@PikFan	what is it?
2015-12-04 01:33:55	ScruffyChat	There would be gold nuggets or nuggets of any metal really
2015-12-04 01:34:19	ScruffyChat	And you could either choose to salvage them, or have Pikmin construct something with them
2015-12-04 01:34:29	@PikFan	interesting
2015-12-04 01:34:35	@PikFan	what would you make with them?
2015-12-04 01:34:38	ScruffyChat	A bridge, a line connecting two conduits, things like that
2015-12-04 01:34:53	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-12-04 01:35:00	ScruffyChat	Well, I can't really think of anything but those two
2015-12-04 01:35:03	@PikFan	I'm not sure how they could make bridges
2015-12-04 01:35:15	@PikFan	...heck, I can't see how fragments make bridges
2015-12-04 01:35:18	@PikFan	they should just fall down
2015-12-04 01:35:22	ScruffyChat	They could stack it like hay though

2015-12-04 01:36:13	@PikFan	having a ramp made out of nuggets might be unstable
2015-12-04 01:36:19	ScruffyChat	True
2015-12-04 01:36:25	@PikFan	it's like having a ramp made out of pebbles
2015-12-04 01:36:29	@PikFan	eh, I digress
2015-12-04 01:36:57	@PikFan	there's plenty of nonsensical things in Pikmin anyway
2015-12-04 01:37:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-04 01:38:44	ScruffyChat	Well maybe that's it then, there are metal fragments rather than ceramic
2015-12-04 01:38:55	ScruffyChat	Well, wait, PF won't have fragments
2015-12-04 01:39:09	@PikFan	huh, why not?
2015-12-04 01:39:11	ScruffyChat	It will have preconstructed bridge segments
2015-12-04 01:39:22	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-04 01:39:27	@PikFan	so it will have fragments
2015-12-04 01:39:30	ScruffyChat	So that Pikmin can just dislodge a whole segment and carry it somewhere else
2015-12-04 01:39:34	@PikFan	giant fragments, that is
2015-12-04 01:39:36	ScruffyChat	Yes, but not as many

2015-12-04 01:40:17	@PikFan	there should be underwater bridges

2015-12-04 01:40:51	@PikFan	yeah

2015-12-04 20:14:27	@Espyo	so the more I learn about the template typing system wikia has going
2015-12-04 20:14:35	@Espyo	the more I see how it's retarded
2015-12-04 20:15:13	@Espyo	now, on every page, below the recently edited articles and such, they have a box with the templates that aren't typed, the ones that are typed but not working under mobile, etc.
2015-12-04 20:15:25	@Espyo	as if that would ever be of any interest to the casual reader
2015-12-04 20:15:39	@Espyo	oh, and if you're logged in and go to a wikia you've never been bfore
2015-12-04 20:15:41	@Espyo	*before
2015-12-04 20:15:52	@Espyo	it gives you a warning about how YOUR wiki doesn't have the templates typed and such

2015-12-05 00:07:21	Scruffy	He said just some sort of remix or mashup that was Pikminy
2015-12-05 00:07:29	Scruffy	And at least 2 minutes
2015-12-05 00:07:38	@PikFan	a remix?
2015-12-05 00:07:46	Scruffy	possibly
2015-12-05 00:07:55	Scruffy	I'm going to make multiple themes to experiment
2015-12-05 00:07:55	@PikFan	oh, I know

2015-12-05 00:08:24	Scruffy	I figured out the motif at least
2015-12-05 00:08:26	@PikFan	tough?
2015-12-05 00:08:42	Scruffy	I mean difficult, it's a complicated tune
2015-12-05 00:09:14	@PikFan	...why do I always have the most complicated questions/requests :P
2015-12-05 00:09:27	En_Passant	You want the Plasm Wraith theme incorporated into a Pikcast theme?
2015-12-05 00:09:43	@PikFan	what's wrong with that?
2015-12-05 00:09:48	En_Passant	Spoilers
2015-12-05 00:09:50	Scruffy	He also said to make it upbeat
2015-12-05 00:09:51	@PikFan	no
2015-12-05 00:09:57	@PikFan	no dangers of spoilers
2015-12-05 00:10:15	Scruffy	Well... it does spoil the motif
2015-12-05 00:10:22	Scruffy	And that's a really cool motif
2015-12-05 00:10:32	Scruffy	I'm sorry if I spoiled it for you in the music article, En_Passant
2015-12-05 00:10:43	@PikFan	people who haven't gotten to the Plasm Wraith battle won't recognize the theme, so there's no danger of spoiling the boss
2015-12-05 00:10:52	En_Passant	That's true
2015-12-05 00:11:30	@PikFan	oh, an upbeat theme
2015-12-05 00:11:37	Scruffy	oooooh update to my music software
2015-12-05 00:11:37	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-05 00:11:39	Scruffy	new sounds
2015-12-05 00:11:43	Scruffy	the hyyyyype
2015-12-05 00:11:49	@PikFan	nice!
2015-12-05 00:11:54	Scruffy	It'll be two hours thoug
2015-12-05 00:11:59	Scruffy	6.3 GB of stuff
2015-12-05 00:12:01	@PikFan	maybe... a mashup of the Garden and Forest of Hope?
2015-12-05 00:12:02	@PikFan	wow
2015-12-05 00:12:06	En_Passant	ScruffyChat, why would that have spoiled it
2015-12-05 00:12:18	En_Passant	Oh, wait
2015-12-05 00:12:30	En_Passant	Your name's not ScruffyChat lol
2015-12-05 00:12:36	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-05 00:12:49	Scruffy	Yeah, there's someone else named Scruffy on IRC somewhere
2015-12-05 00:12:56	Scruffy	but I realized they aren't always on
2015-12-05 00:13:03	Scruffy	So often I can use my normal name
2015-12-05 00:13:04	@PikFan	really? wow
2015-12-05 00:13:18	@PikFan	by the way
2015-12-05 00:13:33	@PikFan	how come you chose "Scruffy" as your username?
2015-12-05 00:14:10	Scruffy	A waiter at some really friendly restaurant took one look at my hair and called me Scruffy for the rest of the night
2015-12-05 00:14:28	Scruffy	I can't remember the name of the restaurant
2015-12-05 00:14:28	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-12-05 00:14:59	@PikFan	well, it's just funny, because the word "scruffy" means dirty or untidy, and your work is the complete opposite of that
2015-12-05 00:15:19	Scruffy	heh
2015-12-05 00:15:25	Scruffy	well my hair still suits it
2015-12-05 00:15:30	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-05 00:15:41	Scruffy	And the nickname just stuck throughout high school and now it's with me
2015-12-05 00:15:49	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-05 00:16:00	@PikFan	my real life friends call me "Freshie"
2015-12-05 00:16:15	Scruffy	Heh, kind of the opposite
2015-12-05 00:16:39	@PikFan	because I was a freshman last year and I tried calling my sophomore friends "Sophie", so they called me "Freshie" in return
2015-12-05 00:16:43	@PikFan	and it's stuck since then
2015-12-05 00:16:52	En_Passant	Even though you're no longer a freshman
2015-12-05 00:16:58	@PikFan	that's the thing
2015-12-05 00:17:12	@PikFan	they keep calling me "Freshie" even though I'm not a freshman
2015-12-05 00:17:17	Scruffy	Aww man, I'm sorry
2015-12-05 00:17:23	@PikFan	nah, it's fine
2015-12-05 00:17:28	@PikFan	I've gotten used to it
2015-12-05 00:17:44	Scruffy	Well that's good
2015-12-05 00:17:46	@PikFan	I don't really mind it
2015-12-05 00:18:11	@PikFan	well, they're girls
2015-12-05 00:18:19	@PikFan	and you know how stubborn girls can be
2015-12-05 00:18:24	Scruffy	Well sophie is a real name
2015-12-05 00:18:37	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-12-05 00:19:26	Scruffy	And En_Passant, how did you come about "en passant?"
2015-12-05 00:20:55	En_Passant	I made the name for myself however long ago it was
2015-12-05 00:21:18	En_Passant	I thought it much more fitting than Dry Paratroopa
2015-12-05 00:21:30	@PikFan	oh, it's a chess move https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant
2015-12-05 00:21:55	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-12-05 00:22:11	@PikFan	as for me...
2015-12-05 00:22:16	En_Passant	A move that's not well known in a strategic and logical game
2015-12-05 00:22:18	@PikFan	my username is so unoriginal
2015-12-05 00:22:26	En_Passant	I thought that described me pretty well
2015-12-05 00:22:39	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-12-05 00:23:01	Scruffy	Cool
2015-12-05 00:23:13	En_Passant	Dry Paratroopa was the name I chose when I made an account on MarioWiki when I was 12 or so
2015-12-05 00:23:32	@PikFan	wow, 6 years ago
2015-12-05 00:23:34	En_Passant	It was an enemy that didn't exist that I liked
2015-12-05 00:23:51	En_Passant	And after that, I just kept it because I didn't want to think of more names
2015-12-05 00:24:01	En_Passant	Yeah, I know
2015-12-05 00:24:12	En_Passant	I don't actually know how old I was, I just knew it's been about 6 years
2015-12-05 00:24:56	@PikFan	http://www.mariowiki.com/index.php?title=User:Dry_Paratroopa&diff=next&oldid=517891
2015-12-05 00:25:09	@PikFan	I'd actually like a Pikmin DS
2015-12-05 00:25:13	@PikFan	or rather, 3DS
2015-12-05 00:25:59	En_Passant	Correction: it has been 7 years
2015-12-05 00:26:27	@PikFan	you're right
2015-12-05 00:26:29	En_Passant	And a month
2015-12-05 00:27:58	@PikFan	meanwhile, I'm listening to Zelda Reorchestrated's version of Twilight Princess' OST
2015-12-05 00:31:35	--	Pi|Paper_Jam_Bros is now known as Pi
2015-12-05 00:31:53	Scruffy	Oh, yeah, I forgot to ask if you guys wanted to hear anything in the Pikcast themes
2015-12-05 00:31:58	Scruffy	Or did I forget?
2015-12-05 00:32:03	Scruffy	Now I forgot if I forgot
2015-12-05 00:32:12	@PikFan	you forgot if you asked :P
2015-12-05 00:32:18	@PikFan	which you did
2015-12-05 00:32:22	Scruffy	Ah ok
2015-12-05 00:32:31	Scruffy	Right right, and you suggested Plasm Wraith theme
2015-12-05 00:32:38	Scruffy	I'll try it
2015-12-05 00:32:49	@PikFan	before you do, though
2015-12-05 00:32:51	@PikFan	16:12	PikFan	maybe... a mashup of the Garden and Forest of Hope?
2015-12-05 00:32:58	Scruffy	I'll try both
2015-12-05 00:33:00	@PikFan	less spoilery, more upbeat
2015-12-05 00:33:06	@PikFan	and should be easier
2015-12-05 00:33:13	Scruffy	And I also really want to do something a capella
2015-12-05 00:33:55	@PikFan	ooh
2015-12-05 00:34:05	En_Passant	So... Smooth McGroove confirmed?
2015-12-05 00:34:31	Scruffy	Heh, I guess
2015-12-05 00:34:38	Scruffy	I've never done video game music before though
2015-12-05 00:34:49	Scruffy	That's a great name
2015-12-05 00:36:15	En_Passant	Don't use it, it's the name of a guy of YouTube
2015-12-05 00:36:24	En_Passant	He's really famous for his a capella
2015-12-05 00:36:32	Scruffy	oh yeah, I've seen him
2015-12-05 00:36:40	Scruffy	I'll stick with scruffy
2015-12-05 00:38:51	@PikFan	wait
2015-12-05 00:39:07	@PikFan	you mean you want to try singing a video game theme yourself?
2015-12-05 00:40:12	Scruffy	I do it all the time, they get sooo stuck in your head
2015-12-05 00:40:20	@PikFan	same here
2015-12-05 00:40:27	Scruffy	And I make self-harmonization tracks all the time
2015-12-05 00:41:41	@PikFan	mm
2015-12-05 00:41:48	@PikFan	like you did with the Lipidon?
2015-12-05 00:42:01	@PikFan	or was that something different
2015-12-05 00:43:03	Scruffy	Well, Lipidon was only one track, and it was very altered
2015-12-05 00:43:13	Scruffy	That's certainly not my normal voice, I don't wanna sound like a Lipidon
2015-12-05 00:45:19	@PikFan	oh, I thought what you meant by "self-harmonization" you meant that you recorded your own voice and altered it
2015-12-05 00:45:27	Scruffy	oh
2015-12-05 00:45:41	Scruffy	No, I mean I record multiple tracks to harmonize with myself all the time
2015-12-05 00:45:54	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-05 00:51:46	@PikFan	what have people said about your Impact Site map?
2015-12-05 00:53:16	Scruffy	Nothing yet, just they're surprised it's the 10 year anniversary
2015-12-05 00:53:16	En_Passant	Oh yeah, that
2015-12-05 00:53:18	En_Passant	Very creative
2015-12-05 00:53:21	Scruffy	Thank you
2015-12-05 00:53:32	Scruffy	It's so much fun to design
2015-12-05 00:54:15	Scruffy	I realized if you're developing a map like that you've always got to say, "Nope. Too easy."
2015-12-05 00:55:29	Scruffy	I'd like to do more with the other Pikmin maps, but that one took a while and it got late
2015-12-05 01:02:27	En_Passant	Forest Navel's already been done, if that helps
2015-12-05 01:02:39	@PikFan	where?
2015-12-05 01:02:44	Scruffy	Forgotten cove
2015-12-05 01:02:55	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-12-05 01:02:57	@PikFan	durr
2015-12-05 01:03:06	@PikFan	Forgotten Cove is hard
2015-12-05 01:03:36	@PikFan	I had to watch a video guide to get platinum on it in Collect Treasure!

2015-12-05 01:04:02	Scruffy	Ah ok
2015-12-05 01:04:04	Scruffy	Thx
2015-12-05 01:04:22	@PikFan	yup
2015-12-05 01:04:37	Scruffy	Well you could salvage the anti-electrifier or scorch guard upgrades and get past obstacles that otherwise couldn't be passed
2015-12-05 01:04:45	Scruffy	like an electric arc
2015-12-05 01:05:18	@PikFan	huh?
2015-12-05 01:05:34	@PikFan	you can't collect those upgrades in Mission Mode, though...
2015-12-05 01:10:56	@PikFan	ughhhhhh
2015-12-05 01:11:02	@PikFan	I need Christmas to get here
2015-12-05 01:11:06	@PikFan	I need Splatoon
2015-12-05 01:16:08	En_Passant	Paper Jam's music is so much more atmospheric than either of the component series
2015-12-05 01:16:51	En_Passant	Not Pikmin 3 level of atmospheric, though

2015-12-07 19:55:21	@Espyo	unfortunately, I landed 4th, and only 3rd - 1st gave any prizes
2015-12-07 19:55:21	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2015-12-07 19:55:24	@Espyo	but oh well, competition was tough
2015-12-07 19:55:27	@PikFan	aww
2015-12-07 19:55:28	@Espyo	and then we had... the other tourney
2015-12-07 19:55:31	@Espyo	which made NO sense
2015-12-07 19:55:31	@PikFan	MK8
2015-12-07 19:55:38	@Espyo	still don't know if what I know is right or not
2015-12-07 19:55:44	@Espyo	yeah, MK8... is just part of it
2015-12-07 19:55:57	@PikFan	...what?
2015-12-07 19:56:03	@Espyo	on the big screen where it was held, they kept switching between MK8, Smash, Mario Tennis Ultra Smash, and Mario Maker
2015-12-07 19:56:03	@PikFan	there were other games in that one?
2015-12-07 19:56:11	@PikFan	Mario Maker?!
2015-12-07 19:56:22	@PikFan	of all the games, /why/ SMM
2015-12-07 19:56:23	@Espyo	both for people playing casually and for challenges and tournies
2015-12-07 19:56:36	@Espyo	basically, I joined MK8 at one point, was told that it was for the tournament
2015-12-07 19:56:38	@Espyo	okay
2015-12-07 19:56:42	@Espyo	landed 1st on the race, too easy
2015-12-07 19:56:43	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2015-12-07 19:56:47	@Espyo	opponents didn't know how to play that well
2015-12-07 19:56:51	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-07 19:57:02	@Espyo	got a dumb Mario paper hat to show that I got 1st
2015-12-07 19:57:03	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2015-12-07 19:57:19	@Espyo	and I figured I had to come back later, where all the winners would square off to decide the final winners
2015-12-07 19:57:21	@Espyo	and I was right, sort of
2015-12-07 19:57:34	@Espyo	when I got to the final part, on the queue, somebody told me that I had missed stuff
2015-12-07 19:57:36	@Espyo	namely, Mario Tennis
2015-12-07 19:57:42	@PikFan	oops
2015-12-07 19:57:44	@Espyo	I had to play that too, and win that, to qualify for these finals
2015-12-07 19:57:48	Yoshi2	rip
2015-12-07 19:57:51	@Espyo	right, and who said those rules?
2015-12-07 19:57:52	@Espyo	NOBODY
2015-12-07 19:57:58	@Espyo	I either had to GUESS the rules
2015-12-07 19:58:09	@Espyo	or stay at the Nintendo panel THE ENTIRE DAY to listen to them say the rules over the speakers
2015-12-07 19:58:28	@PikFan	...it took a whole day to announce a set of rules?
2015-12-07 19:58:28	@Espyo	would it be SO HARD to explain how to join the tourneys, and what they were about, on a POSTER SOMEWHERE?
2015-12-07 19:58:31	@PikFan	that's stupid
2015-12-07 19:58:37	@Espyo	they might've announced throughout the day
2015-12-07 19:58:44	@PikFan	hm

2015-12-07 21:07:15	Yoyo	Since there are so many abilities for fan-made and canonical Pikmin types, it makes the page really long.
2015-12-07 21:07:24	Scruffy	Exactly
2015-12-07 21:09:17	Yoyo	And multiple pikmin types have the exact same abilities.
2015-12-07 21:11:43	Scruffy	Maybe we could have two-collumn tables

2015-12-07 21:39:32	@PikFan	this theme made me stressed out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsYEwZCwQQc&index=14&list=PLV9ZrDQVqbTW6zi2fHgKLbUvjrGSPtlyZ
2015-12-07 21:39:43	@PikFan	I played the Splatoon Testfire back in August
2015-12-07 21:39:51	@PikFan	and that theme plays during the last minute
2015-12-07 21:40:13	@PikFan	so when our team was losing, that theme would stress me out because I wanted to win
2015-12-07 21:40:39	Scruffy	Euw, that would set in the pressure

2015-12-07 22:42:36	@PikFan	hey Scruffy, here's an idea
2015-12-07 22:42:52	@PikFan	ok, so bosses don't drop upgrade treasures anymore
2015-12-07 22:43:01	@PikFan	instead, they just drop really valuable treasure
2015-12-07 22:43:10	@PikFan	and then you can spend Pokos to buy upgrades
2015-12-07 22:43:23	@PikFan	how's that sound?
2015-12-07 22:44:09	Scruffy	Ooh
2015-12-07 22:44:44	Scruffy	Well, that's only a good mechanic if the upgrades are conveniences, and not required

2015-12-07 22:45:50	@PikFan	they're not mandatory
2015-12-07 22:45:54	Scruffy	Then yeah, that's neat
2015-12-07 22:46:02	Scruffy	From where would you be buying them?
2015-12-07 22:46:05	@PikFan	it's just a shop you can go in and buy upgrades if you'd like
2015-12-07 22:46:12	@PikFan	the Orbital Station
2015-12-07 22:46:23	@PikFan	wait, did I ever tell you about the Orbital Station?
2015-12-07 22:47:06	Scruffy	No 
2015-12-07 22:47:18	UltraMario	hi
2015-12-07 22:47:32	@PikFan	hi
2015-12-07 22:47:34	@PikFan	ok, so
2015-12-07 22:47:49	@PikFan	Hocotate isn't ready to colonize PHP-994 just yet
2015-12-07 22:48:02	@PikFan	so they construct an orbital station around PHP-994
2015-12-07 22:48:27	@PikFan	kinda like a spaceport of sorts
2015-12-07 22:48:44	@PikFan	but you can explore this Orbital Station
2015-12-07 22:48:48	@PikFan	it has shops and such
2015-12-07 22:49:00	@PikFan	and one of the shops I mentioned is the upgrades shop

2015-12-07 22:50:13	@PikFan	no, I don't think so
2015-12-07 22:50:14	@PikFan	why?
2015-12-07 22:50:52	@PikFan	the way I see it, the leaders' ship docks with the Orbital Station, and the Onion hovers outside of it
2015-12-07 22:51:18	Scruffy	Ah okay
2015-12-07 22:51:25	Scruffy	Just when you mentioned you'd explore it
2015-12-07 22:51:33	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-12-07 22:51:37	Scruffy	I thought you might bring Pikmin along
2015-12-07 22:51:42	@PikFan	I meant that the leaders walk around by themselves
2015-12-07 22:51:43	Scruffy	But never mind they couldn't breathe
2015-12-07 22:51:46	Scruffy	Right
2015-12-07 22:51:57	@PikFan	well... hmm

2015-12-07 23:02:23	Scruffy	Oh shoot, I wanted to check if the original Pikmin logo used no more than 100 flowers
2015-12-07 23:02:29	Scruffy	but now that I see it
2015-12-07 23:02:38	Scruffy	that wasn't even considered

2015-12-08 01:05:33	Cheepy-Cheepy	or something
2015-12-08 01:05:37	@PikFan	and also, keeping in with S.S /D/olphin and S.S. /D/rake, I want it to start with a D

2015-12-08 01:05:53	@PikFan	well

2015-12-08 01:06:15	Cheepy-Cheepy	Ahhh
2015-12-08 01:06:21	@PikFan	I really should think these things through

2015-12-08 01:07:44	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-08 01:07:51	@PikFan	that was so long ago
2015-12-08 01:07:56	Cheepy-Cheepy	:P
2015-12-08 01:08:23	Cheepy-Cheepy	The moment PikFan allowed me to have All Ranks Rank :O
2015-12-08 01:08:31	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-08 01:08:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	That is still an amazing feat for me
2015-12-08 01:09:46	@PikFan	yeah

2015-12-08 01:12:34	Cheepy-Cheepy	So, I've been thinking of an idea for a new fanon game
2015-12-08 01:12:40	@PikFan	ooh
2015-12-08 01:12:58	@PikFan	what is it?
2015-12-08 01:12:58	Cheepy-Cheepy	It's where PNF-404 becomes zombified
2015-12-08 01:13:06	@PikFan	interesting
2015-12-08 01:13:11	Cheepy-Cheepy	Like a plague spreads throughout the Pikmin Planet
2015-12-08 01:13:29	@PikFan	does that mean you have to fight Zombie Pikmin?
2015-12-08 01:13:59	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well
2015-12-08 01:14:05	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'm not too sure about that
2015-12-08 01:14:17	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-12-08 01:14:26	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps some Pikmin ended up fleeing before they were infected?
2015-12-08 01:14:27	@PikFan	but there will be zombified enemies, right?
2015-12-08 01:14:33	Cheepy-Cheepy	You bet!
2015-12-08 01:14:39	@PikFan	neat
2015-12-08 01:14:59	Cheepy-Cheepy	Mushroom spores infecting things?
2015-12-08 01:15:05	Cheepy-Cheepy	or something else?
2015-12-08 01:15:12	@PikFan	it has to be something else
2015-12-08 01:15:18	@PikFan	we already have the Puffstool
2015-12-08 01:15:35	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2015-12-08 01:15:44	Cheepy-Cheepy	Wait
2015-12-08 01:15:47	Cheepy-Cheepy	Phosbats
2015-12-08 01:15:55	Cheepy-Cheepy	?
2015-12-08 01:15:59	@PikFan	hm, possibly
2015-12-08 01:16:10	Cheepy-Cheepy	Oooh
2015-12-08 01:16:18	@PikFan	is it cause of that stuff that the Vehemoth Phosbat sprays around that makes Pikmin choke?
2015-12-08 01:16:26	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yup!
2015-12-08 01:16:30	@PikFan	I see

2015-12-08 01:17:03	UltraMario	oops
2015-12-08 01:17:10	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hm?
2015-12-08 01:17:20	@PikFan	he accidentally left #pikipedia
2015-12-08 01:17:33	Cheepy-Cheepy	I noticed that
2015-12-08 01:18:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	Any other enemy thoughts about what caused the infection?
2015-12-08 01:18:17	@PikFan	maybe some sort of extraterrestrial creature
2015-12-08 01:18:40	@PikFan	perhaps some kind of Wraith is infecting the creatures
2015-12-08 01:18:56	Cheepy-Cheepy	Plasm Wraith or Waterwraith perhaps
2015-12-08 01:19:01	@PikFan	right
2015-12-08 01:19:09	@PikFan	I think the Wraiths are extraterrestrial
2015-12-08 01:19:15	@PikFan	the Plasm Wraith, anyway
2015-12-08 01:19:23	Cheepy-Cheepy	After all, Waterwraith's physical form is anchored in another dimension
2015-12-08 01:19:29	@PikFan	the Waterwraith on the other hand might be extradimensional
2015-12-08 01:20:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yes sir
2015-12-08 01:20:41	Cheepy-Cheepy	What is Watery Blowhogs could be the cause?
2015-12-08 01:20:50	Cheepy-Cheepy	WITHERING BLOWHOGS???
2015-12-08 01:21:05	@PikFan	whoah now
2015-12-08 01:21:10	@PikFan	now that's something
2015-12-08 01:21:30	Cheepy-Cheepy	OOOOOOHHHHHHH
2015-12-08 01:21:45	Cheepy-Cheepy	Doodlebug
2015-12-08 01:21:48	Cheepy-Cheepy	jk XD
2015-12-08 01:21:54	@PikFan	oml
2015-12-08 01:22:22	Cheepy-Cheepy	I forgot about the Doodlebug tbh
2015-12-08 01:22:29	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-08 01:23:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	Either Withering Blowhog or the Phosbats
2015-12-08 01:23:38	@PikFan	personally the Withering Blowhog makes more sense to me
2015-12-08 01:23:49	Cheepy-Cheepy	Same here
2015-12-08 01:24:04	Cheepy-Cheepy	I always liked them Withering Blowhogs
2015-12-08 01:25:07	Cheepy-Cheepy	This'll be interesting.
2015-12-08 01:25:28	Cheepy-Cheepy	Pikmin: Infection in Progress
2015-12-08 01:25:49	@PikFan	awesome
2015-12-08 01:25:53	@PikFan	the birth of a new fangame
2015-12-08 01:26:01	Cheepy-Cheepy	Ah, yes
2015-12-08 01:26:12	Cheepy-Cheepy	Just like the creation of PAOTB
2015-12-08 01:26:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	Good times
2015-12-08 01:27:04	Cheepy-Cheepy	Got any better titles or naw?
2015-12-08 01:27:25	@PikFan	no, I like Pikmin: Infection
2015-12-08 01:27:29	@PikFan	it's nice and short
2015-12-08 01:27:38	Cheepy-Cheepy	That;s what she said
2015-12-08 01:27:51	Cheepy-Cheepy	XD
2015-12-08 01:27:53	Cheepy-Cheepy	Had to
2015-12-08 01:27:54	@PikFan	and besides, "infection" can be a metaphor
2015-12-08 01:28:00	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yes
2015-12-08 01:28:05	@PikFan	so the title could be deeper than just a literal infection
2015-12-08 01:28:57	Cheepy-Cheepy	Should I include a Pikmin 1-esque limited amount of days before the disease is cleared?
2015-12-08 01:29:14	@PikFan	maybe a Pikmin 3 style
2015-12-08 01:29:20	Cheepy-Cheepy	So
2015-12-08 01:29:37	@PikFan	collect resources to keep a steady supply of medicine going so you and the Pikmin don't get infected
2015-12-08 01:29:44	Cheepy-Cheepy	Fruits and veggies that may contain a virus lethal to all
2015-12-08 01:29:50	Cheepy-Cheepy	Sounds cool
2015-12-08 01:30:54	Cheepy-Cheepy	"Hey, a fruit that I found in a land of zombified creatures! Better eat it."
2015-12-08 01:31:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	XD
2015-12-08 01:31:06	@PikFan	lol
2015-12-08 01:31:28	Cheepy-Cheepy	Who should be the leader?
2015-12-08 01:31:45	Cheepy-Cheepy	Louie, Olimar, Alph, President, or what?
2015-12-08 01:31:56	@PikFan	not sure
2015-12-08 01:32:00	-->	Scruffy (Mibbit@100.43.gy.mm) has joined #pikipedia
2015-12-08 01:32:09	@PikFan	well, wait
2015-12-08 01:32:13	@PikFan	oh I know
2015-12-08 01:32:18	@PikFan	(welcome back Scruffy)
2015-12-08 01:32:32	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhapd the President had his weak off from Hocotate Freight
2015-12-08 01:32:40	@PikFan	because you took fruits from PNF-404, it has disastrous consequences
2015-12-08 01:32:46	Cheepy-Cheepy	And decided to visit the Pikmin Planet?
2015-12-08 01:32:51	@PikFan	for the ecology of the planet
2015-12-08 01:32:57	@PikFan	and ultimately causes a virus to be born
2015-12-08 01:33:02	@PikFan	I dunno
2015-12-08 01:33:06	Cheepy-Cheepy	MY LORD
2015-12-08 01:33:45	@PikFan	hey Scruffy, is it plausible that getting rid of fruits in an area can cause a disease to be born?
2015-12-08 01:34:01	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps Withering Blowhogs evolved enough to spray an actually poisonous gas that contained a virus that infected all who touched it?
2015-12-08 01:34:05	Scruffy	Mmmm
2015-12-08 01:34:25	Scruffy	Not really, plants encourage animals to eat their fruit to spread their seeds
2015-12-08 01:34:31	Scruffy	That's why fruit is appetizing
2015-12-08 01:34:44	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-08 01:34:48	Cheepy-Cheepy	And rather noice in my opinion
2015-12-08 01:35:34	@PikFan	well, I just thought that since fruits have nutrients that boost the immune system, having a lack of fruits causes organisms' immune systems to become weak, and opens them to infection
2015-12-08 01:36:00	Scruffy	True, but that wouldn't create a disease
2015-12-08 01:36:01	@PikFan	and this could cause a deadly disease to be created somehow
2015-12-08 01:36:06	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-08 01:36:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	16:52, 2 April 2011
2015-12-08 01:36:19	Cheepy-Cheepy	Ahhh
2015-12-08 01:36:39	Scruffy	What are we discussing here?
2015-12-08 01:37:06	Cheepy-Cheepy	A new fanon game idea
2015-12-08 01:37:20	Cheepy-Cheepy	Pikmin: Infection in Progress
2015-12-08 01:37:24	Scruffy	Oooh
2015-12-08 01:37:40	@PikFan	oh, I thought it was just "Pikmin: Infection"
2015-12-08 01:37:49	@PikFan	not "Pikmin: Infection in Progress"
2015-12-08 01:37:50	Cheepy-Cheepy	Or that
2015-12-08 01:37:55	@PikFan	I like the former better
2015-12-08 01:38:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	Thanks mate
2015-12-08 01:38:27	@PikFan	but anyway, yeah, basically it has to do with zombified creatures on the Pikmin Planet
2015-12-08 01:38:42	Scruffy	Ooh
2015-12-08 01:38:43	@PikFan	Cheepy-Cheepy and I are thinking of ways it could be started
2015-12-08 01:38:45	Scruffy	Including Pikmin?
2015-12-08 01:38:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	most of them
2015-12-08 01:39:00	Scruffy	Could be Common Glowcaps
2015-12-08 01:39:08	Cheepy-Cheepy	I thought the same
2015-12-08 01:39:09	@PikFan	maybe
2015-12-08 01:39:29	@PikFan	he likes the idea of Withering Blowhogs, though
2015-12-08 01:39:46	Scruffy	That's true, although they took a break in Pikmin 3
2015-12-08 01:40:00	@PikFan	I suppose so
2015-12-08 01:40:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaos the strain introduced by the Withering Blowhog can only survive aboveground, and the Common Glowcap strain can only thrive underground?
2015-12-08 01:40:30	Cheepy-Cheepy	We also thought about Phosbats spreading the infection
2015-12-08 01:40:55	Scruffy	Maybe a Glowhog :o
2015-12-08 01:41:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	*gasp*
2015-12-08 01:41:06	@PikFan	ooh
2015-12-08 01:41:09	Scruffy	But the two release spores, not strains
2015-12-08 01:41:17	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well
2015-12-08 01:41:19	Scruffy	The infection would be fungal, not bacterial
2015-12-08 01:41:23	Cheepy-Cheepy	You get the point XD
2015-12-08 01:41:28	Scruffy	yeah :D
2015-12-08 01:41:37	Scruffy	I like the idea of Phosbats
2015-12-08 01:41:39	@PikFan	or viral
2015-12-08 01:41:39	Cheepy-Cheepy	:D
2015-12-08 01:41:57	Scruffy	since they obviously spit the ambiguous poison stuff
2015-12-08 01:42:12	Cheepy-Cheepy	Great, now I'm stuck between Withering Blowhogs and Phosbats. :s
2015-12-08 01:42:49	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hm...
2015-12-08 01:43:44	@PikFan	well
2015-12-08 01:43:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	oil well
2015-12-08 01:44:01	Scruffy	That's a deep subject
2015-12-08 01:44:07	Cheepy-Cheepy	heh
2015-12-08 01:44:13	@PikFan	I see what you did there
2015-12-08 01:44:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	That was a kneeslapper
2015-12-08 01:44:29	@PikFan	*I sea what you did there
2015-12-08 01:44:53	Cheepy-Cheepy	ah ah ah
2015-12-08 01:45:00	@PikFan	anyway
2015-12-08 01:45:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yes?
2015-12-08 01:45:47	@PikFan	to me, Blowhogs make more sense, because they inhale the air, and the air inside their bodies get contaminated, then they exhale the air, leaving other organisms to inhale the contaminated air, causing them to get infected as well
2015-12-08 01:46:30	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hm... I'll have to begin a deep-thinking session then.
2015-12-08 01:46:37	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps now
2015-12-08 01:46:39	Cheepy-Cheepy	I dunno
2015-12-08 01:46:50	Cheepy-Cheepy	IMMA FIRIN' MAH LAZOR
2015-12-08 01:47:42	UltraMario	wat
2015-12-08 01:47:55	Scruffy	Alright, so Blowhogs
2015-12-08 01:48:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yes
2015-12-08 01:48:06	Scruffy	Perhaps they were hibernating during the events of P3?
2015-12-08 01:48:15	Scruffy	Even though areas are in different seasons
2015-12-08 01:48:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	Deflated, perhaps?
2015-12-08 01:48:19	Scruffy	Heh
2015-12-08 01:48:36	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hm
2015-12-08 01:50:29	Scruffy	The thing is, Withering Blowhogs did not infect anything before
2015-12-08 01:50:38	Cheepy-Cheepy	Until now
2015-12-08 01:52:00	@PikFan	perhaps some pathogen is introduced to them
2015-12-08 01:52:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	Ooh
2015-12-08 01:52:35	Cheepy-Cheepy	Gonna create the article soon
2015-12-08 01:53:24	Scruffy	brb again
2015-12-08 01:53:46	@PikFan	okay
2015-12-08 01:54:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	Now to absorb all of this information

2015-12-08 01:59:42	Cheepy-Cheepy	Pikfan
2015-12-08 01:59:54	@PikFan	well, do you plan on playing it like a regular Pikmin game or RPG style? or something else?
2015-12-08 02:00:18	Cheepy-Cheepy	Like a regular Pikmin game
2015-12-08 02:00:26	@PikFan	real time strategy, then
2015-12-08 02:00:34	Cheepy-Cheepy	Thank you. :)

2015-12-08 02:03:32	@PikFan	welcome back again
2015-12-08 02:03:39	Scruffy	Thanks
2015-12-08 02:04:01	Scruffy	Every time I have to move my laptop (and close it) Wifi goes down
2015-12-08 02:04:14	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-08 02:04:22	Scruffy	If only I had a KopPad
2015-12-08 02:04:26	@PikFan	hehe
2015-12-08 02:04:33	@PikFan	hey, Cheepy-Cheepy
2015-12-08 02:04:44	Cheepy-Cheepy	Aye
2015-12-08 02:04:46	Scruffy	I mean really, it had apps about a species Koppai didn't know about
2015-12-08 02:04:48	@PikFan	have you seen Scruffy's Pikmin animation?
2015-12-08 02:04:53	Cheepy-Cheepy	Not yet
2015-12-08 02:04:59	Cheepy-Cheepy	But I have seen his work
2015-12-08 02:05:05	Cheepy-Cheepy	It's quite phenominal
2015-12-08 02:05:12	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiO86NF9FbA
2015-12-08 02:05:14	Scruffy	thank you
2015-12-08 02:05:16	@PikFan	yes, it is
2015-12-08 02:05:25	@PikFan	it is phenomenal

2015-12-08 02:07:49	Cheepy-Cheepy	You're very welcome.
2015-12-08 02:13:18	Scruffy	So what would happen in Pikmin: Infection in Progress?
2015-12-08 02:14:12	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'm still deciding
2015-12-08 02:15:38	Scruffy	Ah
2015-12-08 02:15:40	Scruffy	No rush
2015-12-08 02:35:48	Cheepy-Cheepy	UPDATE: Getting templates together
2015-12-08 02:36:08	Scruffy	Cool
2015-12-08 02:53:26	@PikFan	hey Scruffy
2015-12-08 02:53:32	@PikFan	I've got another idea
2015-12-08 02:53:40	@PikFan	this one might be a bit more controversial though
2015-12-08 02:54:05	@PikFan	what if you only needed the 5 canon types to reach the final boss — that is, you don't need to get Cyans, Greens, and Browns?
2015-12-08 02:54:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	Lemme read
2015-12-08 02:55:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hm...
2015-12-08 02:55:25	Cheepy-Cheepy	I haven't even debated that.
2015-12-08 02:55:30	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-08 02:55:56	Cheepy-Cheepy	search [[File:Skull bulborb.png]], which is a soon-to-be not unused file.
2015-12-08 02:56:45	@PikFan	searched
2015-12-08 02:56:49	@PikFan	and it's a Mario enemy?
2015-12-08 02:56:51	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-08 02:57:11	Cheepy-Cheepy	Looks like it
2015-12-08 02:57:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	I like its appearance, however
2015-12-08 02:58:27	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps it could tackle Pikmin and stab them with its spikes
2015-12-08 02:59:54	Cheepy-Cheepy	Aye, gtg
2015-12-08 03:00:15	Cheepy-Cheepy	See ya, Pikfan and Scruffy. Talk to ya both tomorrow! :)

2015-12-08 03:00:59	Scruffy	Hi
2015-12-08 03:01:33	Scruffy	I like the idea of 5 canon Pikmin plus optional Pikmin

2015-12-08 03:03:38	Scruffy	Ah
2015-12-08 03:05:30	Scruffy	Well no problem, I'm normally free around 7
2015-12-08 03:06:18	Scruffy	Well, during the semester, I might not be free all the time when semester ends
2015-12-08 03:06:29	@PikFan	finals
2015-12-08 03:06:48	Scruffy	Yep
2015-12-08 03:06:57	Scruffy	And even after finals
2015-12-08 03:08:07	@PikFan	oh, lovely
2015-12-08 03:09:07	Scruffy	Sorry, but normally off the semester I don't go online a lot during the day

2015-12-08 03:14:23	@PikFan	that's the thing I'm looking forward to about the NX
2015-12-08 03:14:37	@PikFan	games will go from TV to handheld
2015-12-08 03:15:08	UltraMario	but is that even confirmed to be like that?
2015-12-08 03:15:10	Scruffy	I mean that's already sort of happened
2015-12-08 03:15:17	@PikFan	the Wii U kinda introduced this with Off-TV Play
2015-12-08 03:15:20	Scruffy	With the 3Ds
2015-12-08 03:15:23	@PikFan	but that's a limited range
2015-12-08 03:15:26	Scruffy	Oh I see what you mean
2015-12-08 03:15:49	@PikFan	I think with NX, though, if the rumors about having a separable handheld are true...
2015-12-08 03:15:59	@PikFan	then you can take the home console games /anywhere/
2015-12-08 03:16:31	UltraMario	tbh i'd be more interesting in playing 3ds games on the tv
2015-12-08 03:16:32	UltraMario	:P
2015-12-08 03:16:39	UltraMario	we need another thing like the super game boy
2015-12-08 03:16:42	UltraMario	and the game boy player
2015-12-08 03:16:53	UltraMario	it could probably work with the wii u gamepad being the bottom screen
2015-12-08 03:16:58	UltraMario	and the top of the 3ds being the top
2015-12-08 03:17:05	UltraMario	it already sort of works with ds vc
2015-12-08 03:17:23	Miles_	It's better not to get your hopes up
2015-12-08 03:17:46	UltraMario	im not
2015-12-08 03:17:56	UltraMario	i just wish they'd make another thing like the super game boy

2015-12-08 03:19:34	@PikFan	or is it
2015-12-08 03:19:41	Scruffy	get it
2015-12-08 03:19:45	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-08 03:19:47	@PikFan	heheh
2015-12-08 03:19:56	Miles_	I've never heard that joke before

2015-12-08 03:20:13	Scruffy	Puns are the highest form of literature
2015-12-08 03:20:24	Scruffy	I hope I never miss an opportunity to make one

2015-12-08 03:21:11	@PikFan	WAIT A MINUTE
2015-12-08 03:21:17	@PikFan	WE WENT TOTALLY OFF TOPIC
2015-12-08 03:21:19	@PikFan	19:01	Scruffy	I like the idea of 5 canon Pikmin plus optional Pikmin
2015-12-08 03:21:25	@PikFan	okay, as you were saying?
2015-12-08 03:21:25	Scruffy	OH yeah
2015-12-08 03:21:46	Scruffy	But I feel like, with that combined with buying upgrade, the gameplay is very optional
2015-12-08 03:22:00	Scruffy	which might overwhelm the player or underwhelm the game difficulty
2015-12-08 03:22:07	@PikFan	I'm a bit more iffy on that one

2015-12-08 03:22:29	@PikFan	it'd be quite difficult to incorporate into the areas, and I'm not sure that I want to tax myself like that
2015-12-08 03:24:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-08 03:24:19	@PikFan	someone asked me at some point if my three new types have special abilities
2015-12-08 03:24:30	@PikFan	I'm not sure if it was you or En Passant that asked
2015-12-08 03:25:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-08 03:26:03	@PikFan	I'm not sure how the speed, throw arc, and carrying strength would be affected by their resistances
2015-12-08 03:26:19	@PikFan	oh, and fighting strength
2015-12-08 03:26:42	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-08 03:27:34	@PikFan	somewhat unrelated, but there's something that disturbs me
2015-12-08 03:27:56	@PikFan	how is it that Rock Pikmin can survive being crushed or impaled, but not chewed or burned?
2015-12-08 03:29:15	Scruffy	Maybe their rocks are soluble
2015-12-08 03:29:18	Scruffy	Like rock candy
2015-12-08 03:29:46	Scruffy	And their leaves can still be suffocated by fire
2015-12-08 03:32:01	@PikFan	if they are soluble, that'd explain why they drown, too
2015-12-08 03:32:09	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-08 03:32:37	Scruffy	Although that would mean once they're chewed/wet, they would be dissolved anyway
2015-12-08 03:32:51	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-08 03:32:52	@PikFan	brb
2015-12-08 03:32:54	Scruffy	But that's the same Pikmin magic that allows speared Pikmin to emerge unharmed
2015-12-08 03:33:29	Scruffy	ok
2015-12-08 03:37:51	@PikFan	Pikmin magic = Nintendo logic

2015-12-08 19:16:03	@J	regression is fitting curves to data, I think
2015-12-08 19:16:59	@J	so power regression would be trying curves like a*b^(c*x), where x is your variable
2015-12-08 19:17:04	@J	or sums of such curves
2015-12-08 19:17:35	@J	well, maybe
2015-12-08 19:17:58	@J	I thought you'd call that exponential, and x^n would be polynomial, but power sounds like it could be either
2015-12-08 19:19:21	@J	the fun thing is terminology is different across different fields, even using the same terms for different things and different terms for the same things
2015-12-08 19:21:14	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-08 19:21:21	@Espyo	ok, without overcomplicating...
2015-12-08 19:21:34	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:DirtMoundTimesMany.png
2015-12-08 19:21:55	@Espyo	how do I get a function for this data?
2015-12-08 19:22:12	@Espyo	you know, one where if I give a certain X, it'll give me a Y like in that table
2015-12-08 19:22:18	@Espyo	I KNOW I've done stuff like this in school
2015-12-08 19:22:25	@Espyo	and I got something really similar in Excel
2015-12-08 19:22:29	@Espyo	well, LibreOffice's Calc, actually
2015-12-08 19:22:56	@Espyo	on a graph, it created an exponential line that fit the data points as closely as possible
2015-12-08 19:23:16	@Espyo	but when I tried the actual equation it gave, the values were off from what the graph was showing
2015-12-08 19:23:19	@Espyo	so I tried google
2015-12-08 19:23:22	@Espyo	and all hell broke loose
2015-12-08 19:23:25	@Espyo	it's like I entered a new reality
2015-12-08 19:23:33	@Espyo	with entirely new rules about how numbers, probability, and data works
2015-12-08 19:23:57	@Espyo	that's Phineas81707's data on how much time X Pikmin take to finish digging up a dirt mound
2015-12-08 19:24:02	@Espyo	it looks logarithmic
2015-12-08 19:24:13	@Espyo	in that the difference between 1 and 2 Pikmin is huge, but between 70 and 100 is tiny
2015-12-08 19:24:41	@Espyo	so if we could get an equation, we could get an estimate of how much time X Pikmin would take, approximately
2015-12-08 19:24:43	@J	it's not just inverse?
2015-12-08 19:24:51	@Espyo	inverse exponential, sure
2015-12-08 19:25:00	Yoshi2	ok, that does look like some sort of regression
2015-12-08 19:25:02	@Espyo	it reminded me of a logarithmic curve too, is all
2015-12-08 19:25:05	@J	I mean, that's k^(-x)
2015-12-08 19:25:11	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-08 19:25:13	@J	but wouldn't it just be k/x
2015-12-08 19:25:14	@Espyo	that's what Calc gave me
2015-12-08 19:25:21	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-08 19:25:27	@Espyo	well, whatever it is, I'd like to know how I can get it
2015-12-08 19:25:28	@J	both look the same on small scales
2015-12-08 19:25:38	@Espyo	...preferably without having to do calculations by hand
2015-12-08 19:25:47	@J	try plotting against the inverse of time
2015-12-08 19:25:55	@J	so have a column with 1/time
2015-12-08 19:25:59	@J	plot No against that
2015-12-08 19:26:09	@J	see if it gives a straight line
2015-12-08 19:26:16	@Espyo	hm, okay

2015-12-08 19:36:41	Yoshi2	I'd say that up to 50-60 pikmin, adding more pikmin speeds things up, so 16-17 seconds is the limit on how fast it can go
2015-12-08 19:37:09	@J	that could just be timing inaccuracy
2015-12-08 19:37:22	@J	since times past 30 are really close together
2015-12-08 19:37:36	@J	for better data, I would suggest doing 6-9 and doing multiple runs for each
2015-12-08 19:37:48	Yoshi2	better data is definitely needed
2015-12-08 19:39:57	@Espyo	yeah, Phineas did say those values have quite a bit of human error
2015-12-08 19:41:48	@Espyo	 31.9739712419 * X ^ -0.2282854366
2015-12-08 19:42:05	@Espyo	Calc's curve on the plotter DOES match nicely
2015-12-08 19:42:16	@Espyo	but if I try calculating that for certain values of X, it's quite a bit off
2015-12-08 19:42:29	@Espyo	for instance, on the graph, 50 is more or less on 18
2015-12-08 19:42:36	@Espyo	if I calculate it using the equation, I get 13 something

2015-12-09 20:12:41	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-09 20:12:50	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-09 20:12:57	@Espyo	well, you just pull what comes from the heart, really
2015-12-09 20:13:05	@Espyo	but if you need ideas, there are a lot of ways you can approach it
2015-12-09 20:13:14	@Espyo	like, think of it this way: "what game would I like to play?"
2015-12-09 20:13:25	@Espyo	"what game would I love for it to exist, but doesn't?"
2015-12-09 20:13:45	@Espyo	you can also try basing yourself on new ideas, and taking inspiration from ideas that were huge successes
2015-12-09 20:13:55	@Espyo	oh, and point down every idea you have
2015-12-09 20:14:03	@Espyo	even if it means you later throw away 99% of it
2015-12-09 20:14:29	@J	[20:12:57] @Espyo well, you just pull what comes from the heart, really
2015-12-09 20:14:34	@J	isn't this some Disney lyric?
2015-12-09 20:14:52	StarWolf	okay... I still would like to know what kind of page to create first.
2015-12-09 20:14:54	@Espyo	if it isn't, it'll probably be somewhere in the next 5 years
2015-12-09 20:14:57	@Espyo	but nope, I don't think it is
2015-12-09 20:15:04	@Espyo	hmm...

2015-12-09 20:27:23	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-09 20:29:36	StarWolf	So, just say "Title Unkown, due to be reviled latter" or something? 
2015-12-09 20:45:48	StarWolf	Hmm... So If I give it the temporary title "Pikmin: XYZ" or something, It won't be taken down?  
2015-12-09 20:45:57	@Espyo	not really
2015-12-09 20:46:03	@Espyo	if you put a warning saying the name is temporary, it should be fine
2015-12-09 20:46:07	@Espyo	and then the page can be renamed
2015-12-09 20:47:33	StarWolf	Okay. I think I get it. I might ask a friend or someone to help with a title idea...
2015-12-09 20:48:48	@Espyo	good luck

2015-12-10 00:08:05	ScruffyChat	I need to work on that
2015-12-10 00:08:13	ScruffyChat	But I had a picture drawn

2015-12-10 00:09:22	En_Passant	A million?
2015-12-10 00:09:45	ScruffyChat	Yeah, each leaf has to be a shape

2015-12-10 00:36:53	ScruffyChat	Hi!
2015-12-10 00:37:18	@PikFan	so I saw your renders for the Sunset Islet
2015-12-10 00:37:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-10 00:37:29	@PikFan	the tree certainly looks weird
2015-12-10 00:37:37	ScruffyChat	En_Passant mentioned the island was small
2015-12-10 00:37:54	ScruffyChat	And I agreed, but the renders pass 1 million faces, so I can't do much about it yet
2015-12-10 00:38:11	@PikFan	wow, 1 million
2015-12-10 00:38:19	ScruffyChat	All of those leaves are shapes
2015-12-10 00:38:53	@PikFan	that's a lot
2015-12-10 00:39:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-10 00:39:25	ScruffyChat	But I'm really happy with the look of the tree in the first image
2015-12-10 00:39:44	@PikFan	how is your computer able to handle 1 million...?
2015-12-10 00:40:00	ScruffyChat	Blender goes pretty slow at that point
2015-12-10 00:40:19	@PikFan	I bet
2015-12-10 00:40:34	ScruffyChat	But it's worth it to get particulate effects like that
2015-12-10 00:40:45	@PikFan	by the way, why is the tree just green in the aerial image?
2015-12-10 00:40:57	ScruffyChat	I have no idea
2015-12-10 00:41:05	ScruffyChat	it's something to do with the translucency of the leaves
2015-12-10 00:41:20	ScruffyChat	Their color depends on the viewing depth, I think
2015-12-10 00:41:31	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-10 00:41:45	ScruffyChat	And the second image has less depth than the first, the camera is zoomed far in
2015-12-10 00:42:06	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-10 00:43:21	@PikFan	oh awesome
2015-12-10 00:43:46	@PikFan	I just discovered how the arrow keys work on Wii U

2015-12-10 00:44:25	ScruffyChat	You have a wii u emulator?
2015-12-10 00:44:53	@PikFan	no, no, I'm just using the Wii U internet browser
2015-12-10 00:45:09	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-12-10 00:45:14	ScruffyChat	I see

2015-12-10 00:45:52	@PikFan	oops
2015-12-10 00:45:52	ScruffyChat	Hello again
2015-12-10 00:46:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I think I'll make new versions of those that are a bit more substantial
2015-12-10 00:46:28	ScruffyChat	I just realized I was reaching my computer's limits, and I really liked the color
2015-12-10 00:46:43	@PikFan	more substantial? what do you mean?
2015-12-10 00:47:25	ScruffyChat	Bigger/more detailed island
2015-12-10 00:47:40	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-10 00:48:03	ScruffyChat	plus En_Passant commented it wasn't very well-hidden
2015-12-10 00:48:21	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure how to hide it, but I'll think of something
2015-12-10 00:49:48	@PikFan	invisibility
2015-12-10 00:50:07	@PikFan	well, wait
2015-12-10 00:50:41	@PikFan	that might not work because the SOGNO is already there, so it doesn't need to hide
2015-12-10 00:51:08	ScruffyChat	The SOGNO wouldn't know that it's hiding, wouldn't care
2015-12-10 00:51:26	ScruffyChat	The only reason the island has to be hidden is so that Olimar doesn't think to look there until the very end
2015-12-10 00:51:39	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-10 00:52:04	@PikFan	well then, I guess you can make it invisible
2015-12-10 00:52:27	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-12-10 00:52:31	ScruffyChat	I dunno
2015-12-10 00:52:47	ScruffyChat	it'd certainly be easier on my computer though
2015-12-10 00:53:26	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-10 00:53:46	@PikFan	wait
2015-12-10 00:54:15	@PikFan	isn't the Luxuriant Lakeside next to, well, a lake?
2015-12-10 00:54:31	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-12-10 00:54:44	@PikFan	there you go then
2015-12-10 00:55:06	@PikFan	invisible Sunset Islet in the middle of the lake
2015-12-10 00:55:28	ScruffyChat	I like it, but invisible islands aren't that plausible
2015-12-10 00:55:35	ScruffyChat	I had a new idea though
2015-12-10 00:56:03	ScruffyChat	Sunset Islet could be hidden in a mangrove
2015-12-10 00:56:17	ScruffyChat	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Mangroves.jpg
2015-12-10 00:56:41	ScruffyChat	It's a forest where all the trees are just standing in water
2015-12-10 00:56:54	@PikFan	that water is SUPER clear
2015-12-10 00:57:25	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2015-12-10 00:57:36	ScruffyChat	But it could be hidden in a maze of roots like that
2015-12-10 00:57:50	@PikFan	possibly
2015-12-10 00:58:48	-->	StarWolf (Mibbit@ksx97-4.skytechbb.com) has joined #pikipedia
2015-12-10 00:59:29	ScruffyChat	Certainly more of a secret final area than out in the middle of the water is
2015-12-10 01:00:02	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-12-10 01:00:15	@PikFan	I don't see why it can't be invisible
2015-12-10 01:00:32	ScruffyChat	By invisible do you mean it just happens to be transparent?
2015-12-10 01:01:04	@PikFan	by invisible I mean you see nothing
2015-12-10 01:01:24	@PikFan	so... I guess transparent, yeah
2015-12-10 01:01:34	ScruffyChat	But what about when they land there?
2015-12-10 01:01:39	ScruffyChat	How would they know where to go?
2015-12-10 01:02:05	@PikFan	well, that's when it's suddenly revealed
2015-12-10 01:02:24	@PikFan	ok, here's an idea
2015-12-10 01:03:02	@PikFan	say the KHA Lander has the technology to disable its invisibility
2015-12-10 01:03:16	@PikFan	but it needs energy to do it
2015-12-10 01:03:37	@PikFan	so you have to gather even more metal to power it
2015-12-10 01:04:25	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2015-12-10 01:04:46	ScruffyChat	I'm just trying to come up with a way to explain why it's invisible
2015-12-10 01:05:05	@PikFan	energy field, I guess?
2015-12-10 01:05:27	@PikFan	heck, there's this one game and in it, there's an entire PLANET that's invisible
2015-12-10 01:05:57	@PikFan	floating just several hundred miles above the player's home planet
2015-12-10 01:06:23	@PikFan	it's there the whole game but nobody knows about it until the end, when it becomes visible
2015-12-10 01:07:06	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-12-10 01:07:10	StarWolf	Hey... I'd hate to bother you guys... but is there a page that describes a climate mechanic for a fan-game? I need to know so I can link it to my game's page 
2015-12-10 01:07:31	@PikFan	no, I don't think so, sorry
2015-12-10 01:07:43	ScruffyChat	You aren't bothering though, don't worry
2015-12-10 01:07:50	@PikFan	you can make a climate section on your game page, though!
2015-12-10 01:08:53	ScruffyChat	Perhaps the whole tree is just transparent
2015-12-10 01:09:03	ScruffyChat	Like a glassy material
2015-12-10 01:09:34	StarWolf	okay, because I've seen it used in other games, but couldn't find a page for it. Thanks!
2015-12-10 01:09:38	@PikFan	oh, so the island's visible, but anything on it is invisible
2015-12-10 01:09:46	@PikFan	yeah, no problem!
2015-12-10 01:10:24	ScruffyChat	I mean even the island would be glassy
2015-12-10 01:10:35	ScruffyChat	So it would just look like what's behind it
2015-12-10 01:10:42	ScruffyChat	Until he lands closer
2015-12-10 01:12:26	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-10 01:13:10	@PikFan	so from a distance it's invisible/transparent, but when you come closer, it becomes visible
2015-12-10 01:13:34	@PikFan	yeah, that could work
2015-12-10 01:14:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-10 01:14:11	ScruffyChat	I'm trying a test model of it now
2015-12-10 01:14:11	ScruffyChat	looks pretty cool so far
2015-12-10 01:14:34	@PikFan	ah, neat
2015-12-10 01:16:35	@PikFan	this works, because they can't pick up the SOGNO's signal until the KHA Lander is recovered, then they follow the signal, only to see an island appear before their eyes
2015-12-10 01:16:40	@PikFan	I like it
2015-12-10 01:16:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-10 01:17:11	ScruffyChat	The only problem is, it wouldn't aid gameplay very much, since the terrain would be so difficult to see
2015-12-10 01:17:36	@PikFan	err...
2015-12-10 01:17:56	@PikFan	well, if you're on the island, you see all of it
2015-12-10 01:18:28	@PikFan	the island "knows" you're there so it stops trying to hide itself
2015-12-10 01:18:52	@PikFan	so seeing the terrain wouldn't be an issue
2015-12-10 01:19:23	@PikFan	unless if you were several miles away, at which point it'd vanish again
2015-12-10 01:20:21	ScruffyChat	Maybe Pikmin make the terrain seeable
2015-12-10 01:20:21	ScruffyChat	The presence of PIkmin
2015-12-10 01:20:34	@PikFan	oh, sure
2015-12-10 01:21:27	@PikFan	hey, maybe the Onion does something and makes the island visible
2015-12-10 01:22:05	@PikFan	ok, that's a lot simpler than having the KHA Lander making it visible
2015-12-10 01:22:17	ScruffyChat	Well, there are supposed to be hundreds of Onions guarding it
2015-12-10 01:22:56	@PikFan	maybe all those Onions cause it to be invisible
2015-12-10 01:23:30	ScruffyChat	Maybe
2015-12-10 01:23:38	ScruffyChat	Maybe they emit some sort of hormone
2015-12-10 01:23:46	ScruffyChat	And the Onion you have emits a counterhormone
2015-12-10 01:23:50	ScruffyChat	Pheromone*
2015-12-10 01:24:13	@PikFan	right
2015-12-10 01:24:30	ScruffyChat	heh, this somewhere implies a pun with the Beatles song Glass Onion
2015-12-10 01:24:43	@PikFan	your Onion tells the other Onions to let you see the island
2015-12-10 01:24:49	@PikFan	oh, nice
2015-12-10 01:27:41	StarWolf	Sorry to bother you again, but should I keep all of my game's info on just one page, or make separate pages for each pikmin/area/boss, ect.  
2015-12-10 01:28:04	@PikFan	areas and bosses, yes
2015-12-10 01:28:17	ScruffyChat	No problem, I'd say your main game page should have links to each area/boss page
2015-12-10 01:28:27	ScruffyChat	It's like a "hub" page
2015-12-10 01:28:28	@PikFan	(for making separate pages)
2015-12-10 01:29:04	ScruffyChat	And then all of the pages can go under a category, to further organize them
2015-12-10 01:29:09	@PikFan	and then you can have a description of the Pikmin types on your main game page
2015-12-10 01:29:53	StarWolf	ah... okay... thanks! I'm new here and still learning the ropes, but wanted to make a game for my "Ten Things to do wile you wait for pikmin 4" list....
2015-12-10 01:31:03	@PikFan	oh, cool

2015-12-10 19:51:41	Scruffy	Oh, I meant to say, something's been acting up on my Dolphin version of Pikmin 2
2015-12-10 19:52:28	@Espyo	oh?
2015-12-10 19:52:32	Scruffy	normally when an area loads there should be the orange text and then behind it is a ripply effect 
2015-12-10 19:52:45	Scruffy	But in my Dolphin version the rippling doesn't work
2015-12-10 19:52:59	Scruffy	And it's definitely only a matter of how Dolphin handles the game
2015-12-10 19:53:23	Scruffy	But apparently there is text behind the area name that's getting the ripple effect filtered on it
2015-12-10 19:53:35	Scruffy	Behind Valley of Repose there is "Valley of Repose"
2015-12-10 19:53:50	Scruffy	Behind Awakening Wood there is some Japanese name I can't spell at the moment
2015-12-10 19:53:59	Scruffy	Behind Perplexing Pool there is "Challenge Cave"
2015-12-10 19:54:07	Scruffy	And I have yet to see the Wistful Wild
2015-12-10 19:54:39	Scruffy	Whenever it says Today's Report, it seems to erroneously stretch "Valley of Repose" again
2015-12-10 19:55:21	Scruffy	I'll take a screenshot the next time I get to play it
2015-12-10 19:55:46	@Espyo	the hell...
2015-12-10 19:55:52	@Espyo	not having the ripple effect, that could be fine
2015-12-10 19:56:00	@Espyo	could just be some setting on Dolphin that's disabled
2015-12-10 19:56:02	@Espyo	or enabled
2015-12-10 19:56:06	@Espyo	but showing new text?

2015-12-11 00:55:43	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-12-11 00:55:49	ScruffyChat	Aww man, sorry
2015-12-11 00:56:55	PikFan	it's fine
2015-12-11 00:57:03	PikFan	hm, I'll try again now

2015-12-11 00:57:17	PikFan	meh
2015-12-11 00:57:21	ScruffyChat	hmm
2015-12-11 00:57:21	PikFan	so, what's new?
2015-12-11 00:57:54	ScruffyChat	I posted in the deletion policy section, I mentioned whenever we're considering an article we can just see what links to it
2015-12-11 00:58:22	ScruffyChat	That way we can put really short articles' info on the longer articles that link to it, and preserve all information when the article is deleted
2015-12-11 00:58:35	ScruffyChat	I still have nothing on how to organize longer articles though
2015-12-11 01:03:59	PikFan	ah
2015-12-11 01:04:02	PikFan	good point
2015-12-11 01:05:28	ScruffyChat	I'm also trying to set up a Pikmin rig
2015-12-11 01:05:57	ScruffyChat	All the Pikmin that I've used in Blender to make PF's Pikmin and all the requests have been still models from Brawl trophise
2015-12-11 01:06:01	ScruffyChat	trophies*
2015-12-11 01:06:19	ScruffyChat	If I wanted to change their pose, I had to manually move the associated polygons
2015-12-11 01:06:47	ScruffyChat	Now I'm taking a Pikmin model and creating my own custom skeleton for it so I can pose it easily
2015-12-11 01:07:26	ScruffyChat	I also recently learned a trick that can make flat eyes look at objects, so no more blank stares at nothing

2015-12-12 16:00:24	@Espyo	hm, the one I have is a .gcm
2015-12-12 16:00:47	Scruffy	Aha
2015-12-12 16:00:53	Scruffy	Where did you get yours?
2015-12-12 16:00:54	Scruffy	brb
2015-12-12 16:00:54	@Espyo	oh, the MD5 is the same
2015-12-12 16:01:03	@Espyo	I got it years ago so *shrug*
2015-12-12 16:01:11	@Espyo	but it's the same file, even if the extension is different
2015-12-12 16:01:24	@Espyo	yeeeep, so it's not a modified ISO or anything
2015-12-12 16:01:38	@Espyo	it's gotta be a setting on Dolphin or some glitch in your system
2015-12-12 16:03:26	@Espyo	oh, so I DID see these things before
2015-12-12 16:03:34	@Espyo	I had something on the back of my mind telling me I saw them before
2015-12-12 16:04:01	@Espyo	at one point, I was trying to get the textures for the characters on the area name font
2015-12-12 16:04:09	@Espyo	so I dumped the textures as I passed through the loading screens
2015-12-12 16:04:20	@Espyo	turns out the area names are all in a single texture, not character by character
2015-12-12 16:04:26	@Espyo	although cave names are
2015-12-12 16:04:34	@Espyo	anyway, at the time, I found "Challenge Cave" too
2015-12-12 16:04:41	@Espyo	and I saved it on this folder called "to investigate"
2015-12-12 16:04:43	Scruffy	back
2015-12-12 16:04:48	@Espyo	and well, here we are now
2015-12-12 16:05:05	@Espyo	and sure enough, I saved that texture as "PP and WW early name.png"
2015-12-12 16:05:10	Scruffy	Wow
2015-12-12 16:05:26	@Espyo	so, for the texture to be loaded in memory during the title screen, that's normal
2015-12-12 16:05:29	@Espyo	well, weird, but normal
2015-12-12 16:05:34	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-12 16:05:41	@Espyo	but for you to be able to see them?
2015-12-12 16:05:44	@Espyo	that's just wizardry
2015-12-12 16:05:55	Scruffy	It's just not correctly applying that distortion effect
2015-12-12 16:06:11	@Espyo	it looked correct from the screenshots
2015-12-12 16:06:16	Scruffy	Hmm
2015-12-12 16:06:17	@Espyo	just applied on the wrong texture, is all
2015-12-12 16:06:24	Scruffy	Ah, I see
2015-12-12 16:07:10	Scruffy	There are a few other graphical issues to note, I suppose
2015-12-12 16:07:19	Scruffy	I put them in the forum
2015-12-12 16:07:26	@Espyo	oh, ok
2015-12-12 16:07:32	Scruffy	Toady Bloyster textures are infinitely stretched
2015-12-12 16:08:08	Scruffy	It's just a matter of mapping the texture incorrectly
2015-12-12 16:08:25	Scruffy	And then refraction in the marbles and Stupendous Lens doesn't work correctly
2015-12-12 16:08:50	Scruffy	It was even worse in an earlier version of Dolphin, but now it's a little better
2015-12-12 16:08:51	@Espyo	wow
2015-12-12 16:09:31	Scruffy	But it seems very difficult to get right anyway
2015-12-12 16:11:17	Scruffy	In finding this though, I picked up a lot of observations about enemy behavior
2015-12-12 16:11:50	@Espyo	nice
2015-12-12 16:11:56	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-12 16:12:06	Scruffy	I think some things I found could be useful for strategies
2015-12-12 16:12:31	Scruffy	Oh! Another really funny thing
2015-12-12 16:12:37	Scruffy	I was in the Shower Room
2015-12-12 16:12:56	Scruffy	Sublevel 6, because I guess I had forgotten a treasure there and had to go back
2015-12-12 16:13:23	Scruffy	there was a bramble gate blocking one pathway
2015-12-12 16:13:48	Scruffy	But on either side of that pathway there were two adjacent rooms
2015-12-12 16:14:30	Scruffy	And the walls that separated them were pretty thin, so the bramble gate just barely seeped into them
2015-12-12 16:14:59	Scruffy	In one of the rooms there was a Wollywog who noticed me and started trying to jump, but the wall between it and I blocked it
2015-12-12 16:15:24	Scruffy	However, when I had my Pikmin start breaking the bramble gate, the Wollywog jumped into the corner of its room
2015-12-12 16:15:39	Scruffy	And it actually landed on the top of the bramble gate before falling down to the ground
2015-12-12 16:15:50	Scruffy	On top of the very corner of it, that is
2015-12-12 16:16:21	Scruffy	It was so amusing, I got it to happen twice
2015-12-12 16:17:55	@Espyo	hehehe

2015-12-12 21:55:03	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-12 21:55:16	@Espyo	I had the idea that you already realized that those textures were the fiery effects
2015-12-12 21:55:23	@Espyo	I just wasn't reading right

2015-12-12 21:56:07	@Espyo	if we documented everything unused and obscured and such that Pikmin 2 has

2015-12-12 22:00:15	@PikFan	hello
2015-12-12 22:00:54	@Espyo	well, P2 DOES run at 30fps
2015-12-12 22:01:01	@Espyo	so if you're saying yours runs at 28, that's pretty good
2015-12-12 22:01:03	@Espyo	hey PikFan
2015-12-12 22:01:15	Scruffy	That's true
2015-12-12 22:01:28	@PikFan	are you talking about http://www.pikminwiki.com/Forum:Area_Loading_Odd_Text
2015-12-12 22:01:49	Scruffy	Yes, Espyo figured it out
2015-12-12 22:02:07	Scruffy	My version of Dolphin was loading the wrong textures when it showed those area titles
2015-12-12 22:02:20	@Espyo	not the wrong textures
2015-12-12 22:02:21	Scruffy	So the firey ripply effect wasn't working right
2015-12-12 22:02:25	@Espyo	the normal game loads both textures
2015-12-12 22:02:28	@Espyo	the textures for the normal title
2015-12-12 22:02:28	Scruffy	oh
2015-12-12 22:02:31	Scruffy	right
2015-12-12 22:02:34	@Espyo	and those weird textures for the fiery effect
2015-12-12 22:02:45	@Espyo	it's just that since your effect is missing, you see the weird texture in its full glory
2015-12-12 22:02:53	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-12 22:03:52	Scruffy	For some reason the Piklopedia and Treasure hoard bring me down to 18 fps
2015-12-12 22:04:05	Scruffy	I guess since it has to load all those textures and models
2015-12-12 22:04:18	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-12 22:04:25	@Espyo	Piklopedia isn't very good on my machine either
2015-12-12 22:04:29	@Espyo	title screen's also pretty slow
2015-12-12 22:07:11	@PikFan	it's pretty complicated; I'm not sure what's going on exactly
2015-12-12 22:07:14	Scruffy	Ah
2015-12-12 22:07:31	@PikFan	some glitch in Dolphin messing with the textures?
2015-12-12 22:09:33	@PikFan	also, unrelated, but there's a lot more canon info he could've removed http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=The_Ship&curid=1444&diff=50863&oldid=50198
2015-12-12 22:10:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-12 22:15:08	Scruffy	Shoot, I think I just magically fixed my framerate

2015-12-12 23:41:20	Scruffy	I've been conducting observations on the intelligence of enemies in Pikmin 2 and 3
2015-12-12 23:42:39	Testyo	Yeah country, too
2015-12-12 23:42:46	Scruffy	A contender for the smartest is the Medusal Slurker
2015-12-12 23:44:17	Scruffy	But Wollywogs are pretty smart as well
2015-12-12 23:46:23	Scruffy	I think I'll have to keep enemies within their own games though
2015-12-12 23:46:35	@PikFan	neat
2015-12-12 23:46:54	@PikFan	why do you say the Medusal Slurker is the smartest?
2015-12-12 23:47:21	Scruffy	Most enemies take at least a second to react
2015-12-12 23:48:09	Scruffy	The Medusal Slurker can know whether to slurk or not to slurk a small fraction of a second before it stops moving
2015-12-12 23:48:39	Scruffy	And it has only chooses where to move when it has your location down to a fraction of a second
2015-12-12 23:48:48	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-12 23:50:13	Scruffy	By comparison, a creature like the Puffy Blowhog won't attack until it has you still in one location
2015-12-12 23:50:22	@PikFan	mm
2015-12-12 23:50:41	Scruffy	especially in Pikmin 1, if you keep moving it'll just follow you around
2015-12-12 23:51:01	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-12 23:51:07	Scruffy	So the slower Pikmin are, the more likely it'll attack them
2015-12-12 23:51:12	@PikFan	right
2015-12-12 23:52:25	Scruffy	Swarming Sheargrubs are also really smart, they know how to avoid the water and Pikmin very adeptly
2015-12-12 23:52:37	Scruffy	And they can hide like Pikmin can

2015-12-13 00:06:24	StarWolf	my problem with that one is that I can't change the "caves" and "treasures" out for something that applies to my game.

2015-12-13 01:52:53	@Espyo	!
2015-12-13 01:52:55	@PikFan	we were just talking about your game breaks

2015-12-13 01:53:00	@Espyo	I was going to bed, but sure
2015-12-13 01:53:05	Dave	how do I get the

2015-12-13 01:53:20	@Espyo	I knew you were going to ask that lol
2015-12-13 01:53:37	Dave	~ You know me too well
2015-12-13 01:53:47	@Espyo	well, if you have a weekend to spare, and know the basics of using the command line in windows, then I can give you instructions on skype
2015-12-13 01:53:58	Dave	I'm on a mac, sadly...
2015-12-13 01:54:12	@Espyo	well, that'll be a problem
2015-12-13 01:54:17	@Espyo	you might be able to get the files anyway
2015-12-13 01:54:18	Dave	And I dont have any kind of experience with executing that stuff
2015-12-13 01:54:25	@Espyo	but you won't be able to do anything with them
2015-12-13 01:54:35	@Espyo	they'll just be in a format you can't read
2015-12-13 01:54:39	Dave	I can read model files with programs
2015-12-13 01:54:49	@Espyo	yeah, but you can't open the files that contain the models

2015-12-13 01:55:21	@Espyo	there are some files which are just plain text files, but for that, you're probably better off just asking me or Nathan for them
2015-12-13 01:55:25	Dave	I could open it on a dell sometimes
2015-12-13 01:55:32	Dave	Teach me-- I'll do it!

2015-12-13 02:01:30	Dave	That's what matters! Do you have a lot of parts to use-- or just the basics so far?
2015-12-13 02:01:45	@PikFan	heh, I cheated the time system to get all the parts :P
2015-12-13 02:02:07	Dave	That's the best thing to do-- break it!
2015-12-13 02:02:12	@PikFan	yeah lol

2015-12-13 02:07:01	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-12-13 02:07:13	@PikFan	how did you get OOB in the Rustyard?
2015-12-13 02:07:57	Dave	Complicaed-- but the short answer, rock climbing.
2015-12-13 02:08:19	@PikFan	rock climbing? you mean using Rock Pikmin to climb? lol
2015-12-13 02:08:26	@PikFan	(rare example of a successful joke)
2015-12-13 02:08:35	Dave	heh, no. But that was a good joke!
2015-12-13 02:08:45	@PikFan	hmm
2015-12-13 02:08:45	Dave	But throwing captains at specific points on rocks
2015-12-13 02:08:52	@PikFan	is it like — ah, okay
2015-12-13 02:09:11	Dave	I play pikmin, skyrim, xenoblade, and pokemon all the same way
2015-12-13 02:09:16	Dave	by jumping over rocks
2015-12-13 02:09:27	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-13 02:09:47	@PikFan	by the way, what's the lowest amount of days you finished Pikmin 3 in?
2015-12-13 02:10:04	Dave	Around 20, i think
2015-12-13 02:10:08	@PikFan	nice
2015-12-13 02:10:17	@PikFan	my lowest is 15
2015-12-13 02:10:17	Dave	Im not fast-- but I can clear the oak backwards if that counts for anything
2015-12-13 02:10:22	@PikFan	ooh
2015-12-13 02:10:28	Dave	Sweet~ You're pro
2015-12-13 02:10:47	@PikFan	I need to try clearing the Oak backwards
2015-12-13 02:10:52	Dave	It's fun!
2015-12-13 02:10:57	Dave	Makes the escape easy and fearless
2015-12-13 02:11:07	@PikFan	it's also faster, isn't it — oh, yeah
2015-12-13 02:11:21	Dave	A little faster
2015-12-13 02:11:25	@PikFan	yeah, I'm not able to do the Oak in 1 day
2015-12-13 02:11:29	@PikFan	I always do it in 2
2015-12-13 02:11:33	Dave	but in total it takes more time than the speedrun route
2015-12-13 02:11:45	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-13 02:12:05	Dave	It's because of the warping unused cutscenes
2015-12-13 02:12:09	Dave	they teleport you all over the oak
2015-12-13 02:12:14	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-12-13 02:12:14	Dave	So you have to walk more than usual
2015-12-13 02:12:18	@PikFan	weird
2015-12-13 02:12:31	@PikFan	I don't think I'd ever be able to do the 10 day run, though
2015-12-13 02:12:42	@PikFan	really because of the Garden of Hope, 2nd time

2015-12-13 02:16:45	@PikFan	1. one time I was reading out loud a Pikmin fanfiction to some of my friends at school
2015-12-13 02:16:51	@PikFan	and they said it sounded like Undertale
2015-12-13 02:16:59	Dave	Interesting~
2015-12-13 02:17:03	@PikFan	because the fanfic was describing the caves in Pikmin 2
2015-12-13 02:17:12	Dave	Oh! That makes sense.
2015-12-13 02:17:33	@PikFan	2. there's this really funny Splatoon and Undertale mashup video so Tropical Wilds, 2nd time in just 1 day, and

2015-12-13 03:54:59	@PikFan	I'm currently watching a video about Graham's number
2015-12-13 03:55:46	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-12-13 03:56:08	ScruffyChat	Too many 3's and arrow

2015-12-13 03:56:25	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-13 03:56:52	@PikFan	it's what, 3^^^3?
2015-12-13 03:57:03	@PikFan	or is it more than that
2015-12-13 03:59:58	ScruffyChat	64 layers of 3^^^3
2015-12-13 04:01:29	@PikFan	._.
2015-12-13 04:08:00	ScruffyChat	Ugh making a Red Pikmin rig has been going so well up until the stem
2015-12-13 04:08:18	@PikFan	why's the stem harder?
2015-12-13 04:09:12	ScruffyChat	I want to be able to make the stem move relative to a curve
2015-12-13 04:09:33	ScruffyChat	So that it's always smoothly curved, and not obviously bent at one or two joints
2015-12-13 04:09:40	ScruffyChat	But Blender's having none of it
2015-12-13 04:10:29	ScruffyChat	It half works, but I can't figure out why the other half isn't
2015-12-13 04:10:47	@PikFan	strange
2015-12-13 04:18:25	ScruffyChat	Oh shoot, it's almost working
2015-12-13 04:18:52	@PikFan	heh, shoot
2015-12-13 04:18:57	@PikFan	like a plant shoot
2015-12-13 04:20:14	ScruffyChat	heh
2015-12-13 04:23:03	ScruffyChat	Okay, I think I know how it works now
2015-12-13 04:23:10	@PikFan	nice
2015-12-13 04:23:31	ScruffyChat	The thing is, there's a feature in Blender that I haven't used much yet called "Weight Painting"
2015-12-13 04:23:51	ScruffyChat	where vertices on an object are all blue and you can paint them red
2015-12-13 04:24:15	ScruffyChat	And the redder they are, the more they are effected by things they're assigned to, like bones in a skeleton
2015-12-13 04:25:08	@PikFan	how coincidental, considering you're making the wireframe of a Red Pikmin

2015-12-14 00:03:53	@Espyo	so far, we just list the buttons, but not the control scheme
2015-12-14 00:04:12	@PikFan	like, the tooltip for the second GamePad button should say "X Button on the GamePad in Stylus Mode" or something of that effect
2015-12-14 00:04:14	@PikFan	right
2015-12-14 00:04:37	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-14 00:05:03	@Espyo	although if we're going to add control schemes, we need to make it clear for no-mouse users too
2015-12-14 00:05:10	@Espyo	so Nintendo console readers and mobile readers
2015-12-14 00:05:18	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-12-14 00:05:24	@PikFan	what a conundrum...
2015-12-14 00:05:33	@Espyo	yeah, there's no good way
2015-12-14 00:05:49	@Espyo	life was so much easier with P1 and P2...
2015-12-14 00:06:23	@PikFan	really, I just want to make it clear, because I'm sure there's people who aren't aware of Stylus Mode
2015-12-14 00:06:36	@PikFan	and I don't want them freaking out because of redundant GamePad buttons
2015-12-14 00:07:12	@Espyo	mhm
2015-12-14 00:07:37	@PikFan	I wonder how the controls will work in P4
2015-12-14 00:08:03	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-12-14 00:08:23	@PikFan	I realized why I didn't like playing on the GamePad/Pro Controller in P3
2015-12-14 00:08:26	@PikFan	because of the cursor
2015-12-14 00:08:44	@PikFan	in P1 and 2, the cursor had a short range, but was easy to control
2015-12-14 00:08:54	@PikFan	but in P3, the cursor could go... everywhere
2015-12-14 00:08:58	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2015-12-14 00:09:00	@Espyo	I've gotten used to it
2015-12-14 00:09:03	@PikFan	so it was harder
2015-12-14 00:09:08	@Espyo	I can use any control scheme on any game without problem now
2015-12-14 00:09:30	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-14 00:09:45	@Espyo	hey, one thing
2015-12-14 00:09:51	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-12-14 00:09:51	@Espyo	I played the game today
2015-12-14 00:09:56	@PikFan	yeah?
2015-12-14 00:09:58	@Espyo	to try to recreate the free camera glitch in mission mode
2015-12-14 00:10:01	@Espyo	couldn't do it, btw

2015-12-14 00:10:12	@Espyo	and the sound in Mario Maker doesn't match the sound of an invalid go here location
2015-12-14 00:10:19	@Espyo	at least, not the sound you hear when the button APPEARS
2015-12-14 00:10:25	@Espyo	I actually didn't try CLICKING the invalid button
2015-12-14 00:10:25	@PikFan	oh, hmm
2015-12-14 00:10:28	@Espyo	...should've tried that
2015-12-14 00:10:39	@PikFan	well, I know the sound is in P3 somewhere
2015-12-14 00:10:44	@PikFan	because I recognized it
2015-12-14 00:10:47	@Espyo	well, the gamepad's on my lap
2015-12-14 00:10:51	@Espyo	just got out of playing Splatoon
2015-12-14 00:10:55	@Espyo	so I can test now real quick
2015-12-14 00:11:00	@PikFan	oh, ok
2015-12-14 00:11:02	@Espyo	yeah, it's definitely in the game somewhere
2015-12-14 00:11:03	@Espyo	but...
2015-12-14 00:12:13	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-14 00:12:16	@Espyo	it IS the same sound
2015-12-14 00:12:19	@Espyo	when you PRESS the invalid button
2015-12-14 00:12:29	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-12-14 00:12:55	@PikFan	yeah, I thought that was a cool touch
2015-12-14 00:13:02	@PikFan	but why something so obscure...?
2015-12-14 00:13:55	@Espyo	they likely add every non-specific sound they create to an internal library
2015-12-14 00:13:59	@Espyo	so they can use it for stuff like this
2015-12-14 00:14:10	@Espyo	if it's a big new game, they might create whole new sound effects for everything
2015-12-14 00:14:17	@Espyo	specially if they need something to fit a specific mood
2015-12-14 00:14:20	@Espyo	but Mario Maker?
2015-12-14 00:14:30	@Espyo	they needed a large list of zany sound effects
2015-12-14 00:14:34	@Espyo	so they just grabbed stuff from their library
2015-12-14 00:14:42	@Espyo	so does this sound always play when you press the K on the title screen?
2015-12-14 00:15:34	@Espyo	also I've got the radar on the Formidable Oak between the towertop where Olimar is lying, and the first big corridor room
2015-12-14 00:15:41	@Espyo	and the TV screen shows weird locations
2015-12-14 00:16:00	@Espyo	and shadows of leaves
2015-12-14 00:16:56	@PikFan	odd
2015-12-14 00:17:17	@Espyo	could be worth checking one day
2015-12-14 00:17:36	@PikFan	also, the first time you tap K, the screen changes to a sepia theme
2015-12-14 00:18:03	@PikFan	the second time you tap K, it goes back to normal, and that's when the KopPad sound effect plays
2015-12-14 00:18:08	@Espyo	ah
2015-12-14 00:18:31	@PikFan	by the way
2015-12-14 00:18:42	@PikFan	I was reading through some old logs of when I first got P3
2015-12-14 00:18:55	@PikFan	can't believe it's been almost 2 years...
2015-12-14 00:19:01	@Espyo	hehe yeah
2015-12-14 00:19:31	@Espyo	well, need to go to bed
2015-12-14 00:19:31	@PikFan	speaking of logs, J needs to update his logs

2015-12-14 20:49:42	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/MediaWiki:Pagetitle shouldn't we be changing this to "the Pikmin wiki"?
2015-12-14 20:50:51	Pidgeotto	hmm
2015-12-14 20:50:58	Pidgeotto	that sounds like a brilliant idea
2015-12-14 20:51:01	Pidgeotto	I support that
2015-12-14 20:51:11	@Espyo	I thought we discussed that we were going to do that, but
2015-12-14 20:51:14	@Espyo	poof went the idea
2015-12-14 20:54:33	@J	hmm
2015-12-14 20:54:43	@J	sure, wiki means more than encyclopaedia
2015-12-14 20:54:52	@J	but wiki means nothing to some people
2015-12-14 20:55:26	@J	if it's the extra meaning you want, you could use 'collaborative encyclopedia' or something
2015-12-14 20:55:27	@Espyo	nowadays, I think it means more
2015-12-14 20:55:40	@Espyo	no, just to include the word "wiki" for search engine optimization
2015-12-14 20:58:34	@J	meh...I never like SEO
2015-12-14 20:58:39	@J	seems like a hack
2015-12-14 20:58:48	@J	*never liked
2015-12-14 20:58:52	@Espyo	if you do it immorally
2015-12-14 20:59:05	@Espyo	in our case, we know a lot of people search for "Pikmin wiki"
2015-12-14 20:59:17	@Espyo	and having the title match that gives us hits
2015-12-14 20:59:35	@Espyo	not so much a question of giving us readers (although it is) as it is a question of giving users what they searched for
2015-12-14 20:59:40	@J	if the user's search terms _are_ associated with your website, and your content is well-written and well-presented, the search engine should be able to find the link
2015-12-14 20:59:53	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-14 21:00:01	@J	nowadays they associate similar words, like a thesaurus
2015-12-14 21:00:14	@Espyo	but are we really in a position to test that?
2015-12-14 21:00:17	@J	so if we say encyclopaedia, and it's a website, and there are lots of mentions of edit...
2015-12-14 21:00:24	@J	'wiki' will probably be picked up
2015-12-14 21:00:29	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2015-12-14 21:01:13	@J	we know a lot of people search for 'Pikmin wiki' because a lot of people find us through that term?
2015-12-14 21:01:25	@J	if so, then it's already working
2015-12-14 21:03:34	@J	if you're going to try to get higher in search rankings, the way to do it is try to get linked from other websites
2015-12-14 21:03:57	@J	oh, and by the way, an article with no mentions of 'wiki' has the word 42 times on the page anyway
2015-12-14 21:04:02	@J	it's on the main page 65 times

2015-12-15 00:07:46	@Espyo	so they can contribute in the best way possible
2015-12-15 00:07:50	@Espyo	it doesn't interest the casual editors
2015-12-15 00:07:56	@Espyo	nor should it
2015-12-15 00:08:14	@Espyo	shoving policies and rules down the throat of somebody who just wants to point down the location of a few obstacles is the best way to drive them away
2015-12-15 00:08:33	@PikFan	I guess
2015-12-15 00:09:28	@Espyo	no worries
2015-12-15 00:09:37	@Espyo	people who actually would follow the policy know where to find it
2015-12-15 00:09:42	@Espyo	plus Pikan is always around the corner
2015-12-15 00:09:47	@Espyo	and I always come later to clean stuff up
2015-12-15 00:09:53	@PikFan	true
2015-12-15 00:10:00	@Espyo	heck, I'm imagining myself editing something on, say, Smash Wiki
2015-12-15 00:10:04	@Espyo	and not reading the policies for it
2015-12-15 00:10:13	@Espyo	unless I were to become a frequent Smash Wiki editor, I wouldn't really care
2015-12-15 00:10:16	@Espyo	if they like my edit, good
2015-12-15 00:10:21	@Espyo	if not, they can revert it or fix it
2015-12-15 00:10:32	@Espyo	I'm not reading through all the policies to know what and what doesn't apply to what I'm going to do
2015-12-15 00:10:37	@Espyo	there's not even a starting point to the policies
2015-12-15 00:10:42	@Espyo	just any policy can apply at any time
2015-12-15 00:10:46	@PikFan	right
2015-12-15 00:10:49	@Espyo	you might be working on areas
2015-12-15 00:10:57	@Espyo	you have to follow the general policy and the area article policy
2015-12-15 00:11:00	@Espyo	and you think you're done
2015-12-15 00:11:05	@Espyo	but oh wait there's still the object list policy
2015-12-15 00:11:14	@Espyo	honestly, I was never much of a fan of the name policy for these things
2015-12-15 00:11:22	@Espyo	stuff like "Pikmin must always be written like Pikmin", that's a policy
2015-12-15 00:11:28	@Espyo	that's something we have to vow to keep
2015-12-15 00:11:30	@Espyo	but the rest?
2015-12-15 00:11:35	@Espyo	they're more guidelines than anything
2015-12-15 00:11:44	@PikFan	my biggest issue with the Pikmin 3 info was the policies, but like you said, the policies are — exactly
2015-12-15 00:11:55	@PikFan	like, I wanted to get it down
2015-12-15 00:11:57	@PikFan	but...
2015-12-15 00:12:03	@Espyo	get what down?
2015-12-15 00:12:05	@PikFan	I was just afraid it wouldn't be good enough
2015-12-15 00:12:11	@PikFan	I meant when I first got P3
2015-12-15 00:12:28	@PikFan	it's part of the reason why I didn't contribute much like I should have
2015-12-15 00:12:36	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-15 00:12:39	@Espyo	well
2015-12-15 00:12:48	@Espyo	if you had known that they're not really mandatory, maybe it would've changed...
2015-12-15 00:12:55	@Espyo	well, doesn't matter now, anyway
2015-12-15 00:12:55	@PikFan	another part was just sheer laziness
2015-12-15 00:12:57	@Espyo	we're good on P3 info
2015-12-15 00:12:59	@PikFan	yep
2015-12-15 00:13:19	@Espyo	well, it'll be more important for Pikmin 4
2015-12-15 00:13:23	@PikFan	just going around and improving the quality of the wiki
2015-12-15 00:13:25	@Espyo	they'll be a way to both organize the chaos
2015-12-15 00:13:32	@Espyo	and to make sure we don't forget any info
2015-12-15 00:13:35	@PikFan	*there'll?
2015-12-15 00:13:45	@Espyo	(the policies will be a way)
2015-12-15 00:13:55	@PikFan	(oh)
2015-12-15 00:13:56	@Espyo	it's easy to document an enemy and just go like "ok, it does this and that... what else should I write?"
2015-12-15 00:14:00	@PikFan	(hence the ? )
2015-12-15 00:14:12	@Espyo	with the policies, it has a lot on what info to add
2015-12-15 00:14:16	@PikFan	right
2015-12-15 00:14:26	@Espyo	really should get around to renaming them one day
2015-12-15 00:14:30	@Espyo	"policy"... so scary
2015-12-15 00:14:36	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-15 00:14:46	@PikFan	I like guidelines, but... eeeeehhhhhhhh
2015-12-15 00:14:50	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-15 00:15:20	@PikFan	http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/guideline?s=t
2015-12-15 00:15:51	@PikFan	also, now that we've got more editors here, adding P4 info will be a cinch
2015-12-15 00:16:13	@PikFan	...which was another reason why I didn't edit: it was so overwhelming
2015-12-15 00:16:36	@PikFan	it was just a daunting task
2015-12-15 00:16:49	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-15 00:17:04	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-15 00:17:05	@PikFan	I still could go through the fruit articles and add the missing images to them
2015-12-15 00:17:10	@Espyo	little by little we'll get there
2015-12-15 00:17:13	@PikFan	I got most of them done
2015-12-15 00:17:17	@Espyo	are there still missing images?
2015-12-15 00:17:29	@Espyo	well, if you want to do anything, always remember [[Pikipedia:Helping out]]
2015-12-15 00:17:30	@PikFan	no, I uploaded all the missing fruit images already
2015-12-15 00:17:30	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Helping_out" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Helping_out
2015-12-15 00:17:36	@PikFan	I just have to add them to the fruit pages
2015-12-15 00:17:42	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-12-15 00:17:45	@Espyo	yeah, take care of that ASAP
2015-12-15 00:17:51	@Espyo	I could've used the images a few times before...
2015-12-15 00:17:56	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-15 00:18:01	@Espyo	like when I made the navboxes and couldn't remember where fruit X or Y was...
2015-12-15 00:18:08	@Espyo	well, I have to get going
2015-12-15 00:18:09	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-15 00:18:10	@Espyo	night
2015-12-15 00:18:12	@PikFan	night
2015-12-15 00:18:26	@Espyo	oh, and if all goes well, I'll launch an engine update on christmas
2015-12-15 00:18:33	@PikFan	yay
2015-12-15 00:18:35	@Espyo	nothing big, but it has a main menu and options menu
2015-12-15 00:18:42	@PikFan	oh, I organized the update sections

2015-12-15 18:57:06	Yoshi2	last-minute debugging is not very fun
2015-12-15 18:58:35	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2015-12-15 18:59:47	Yoshi2	I wouldn't have to do last-minute debugging if my partner responded earlier than on the last day before the homework deadline

2015-12-15 19:11:08	@J	I looked at the thing, Espyo
2015-12-15 19:11:15	@Espyo	right
2015-12-15 19:11:27	@J	with the little data you have, your solution actually looks pretty good
2015-12-15 19:12:06	@Espyo	more data would give us a better approximation
2015-12-15 19:12:11	@J	17.84 * x ^ (-0.4)
2015-12-15 19:12:12	@Espyo	but the average error would be pretty big
2015-12-15 19:12:16	@Espyo	it already is big on what exists
2015-12-15 19:12:32	@Espyo	yeah, something like that
2015-12-15 19:12:41	@Espyo	but it doesn't really fit all cases well
2015-12-15 19:12:44	@Espyo	I mean, I know it's not meant to fit
2015-12-15 19:13:06	@Espyo	but like, some values for whatever function I get vary from what me and her got by 3 or more seconds
2015-12-15 19:13:10	@Espyo	that's not really human error any more
2015-12-15 19:13:24	@Espyo	maybe silly stuff like maturity actually being important
2015-12-15 19:13:27	@Espyo	but just hard to pinpoint
2015-12-15 19:13:29	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/untitled.pdf
2015-12-15 19:14:00	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-15 19:14:12	@J	that's both data sets combined
2015-12-15 19:14:23	@J	they seem to match each other fairly well
2015-12-15 19:14:32	@Espyo	with or without the 10 second start delay?
2015-12-15 19:14:34	@J	(I multiplied your times by 33/2)
2015-12-15 19:14:47	@J	does that answer the question?
2015-12-15 19:15:02	@Espyo	it only makes it more confusing
2015-12-15 19:15:07	@Espyo	what do you mean 33/2?
2015-12-15 19:15:17	@Espyo	...16.5?

2015-12-15 19:17:04	@J	yeah
2015-12-15 19:17:18	@J	(34-1)/(3-1)
2015-12-15 19:17:44	@J	eating now
2015-12-15 19:17:48	@Espyo	all right
2015-12-15 19:17:57	@Espyo	yeah, seems about right, but I'm not sure about putting it on the wiki
2015-12-15 19:18:05	@Espyo	we could say this formula approximates
2015-12-15 19:18:14	@Espyo	between having that and nothing, I'd say that
2015-12-15 19:18:39	@J	you can just say something qualitative
2015-12-15 19:18:48	@J	'as Pikmin are added, their effectiveness decreases'
2015-12-15 19:18:52	@J	plus the bit about 10s
2015-12-15 19:19:08	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-15 19:19:13	@Espyo	it's what's already on the article
2015-12-15 19:19:18	@Espyo	and I guess it'll do
2015-12-15 19:19:24	@Espyo	heck, at any rate, it's just the dirt mounds
2015-12-15 19:19:31	@Espyo	not even the most interesting or important obstacles
2015-12-15 19:19:48	@Espyo	I'd be more interested in finding out how Pikmin numbers affect the speed at which bridges are built and such
2015-12-15 19:20:29	@J	gates
2015-12-15 19:20:41	@J	the 10s thing sounds useful for speedruns
2015-12-15 19:20:46	@J	you only need 1 Pikmin on it for a while
2015-12-15 19:21:01	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-15 19:21:16	@Espyo	so what we have now is interesting enough
2015-12-15 19:21:39	@Espyo	if we had to get deeper info about the way dirt mounds work, we better get access to the game's source code or otherwise it's not really worth it
2015-12-15 19:34:17	Yoshi2	receiving access to the game's source code is very unlikely
2015-12-15 19:35:48	@Espyo	yep

2015-12-15 19:44:14	@Espyo	yeah...

2015-12-15 19:53:42	@Espyo	the guy gave no info on how he did it
2015-12-15 19:55:08	Yoshi2	well
2015-12-15 19:55:45	Yoshi2	we already know how to somewhat read (and thus write) BMS files, so editing the music is not impossible
2015-12-15 19:56:05	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-15 19:56:12	@Espyo	but this edit seems so... not random
2015-12-15 19:59:24	Yoshi2	I'm slightly inspired to write a new bms module that can read and write BMS stuff
2015-12-15 20:00:21	@Espyo	hmm

2015-12-15 22:33:50	En_Passant	They added another goddamn Fire Emblem character
2015-12-15 22:34:13	En_Passant	The series that wasn't released outside of Japan until like 2003 now has more characters than the Legend of Zelda
2015-12-15 22:34:50	@Espyo	Awakening made me LOVE Fire Emblem
2015-12-15 22:34:53	@Espyo	but EESSH, enough!
2015-12-15 22:35:46	En_Passant	And ties with Pokemon, the second most popular franchise is history
2015-12-15 22:35:59	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-15 22:36:10	En_Passant	And worst, they did that instead of Isaac who people actually wanted

2015-12-15 22:36:54	En_Passant	I just caught the end of it, so I don't know what they said about the Smash ballot
2015-12-15 22:37:00	En_Passant	I'm assuming it was Bayonetta who won
2015-12-15 22:37:59	@Espyo	yep, Bayonetta

2015-12-15 22:45:38	En_Passant	Nintendo seems to have a bad rep with that in Smash lately
2015-12-15 22:46:17	En_Passant	Like how Reggie actually did the Hungrybox rematch, but played Ryu because he was in the newest DLC and lost becuase Ryu requires skill
2015-12-15 22:46:34	Gamefreak75	the ice climbers dream is dead
2015-12-15 22:47:19	En_Passant	They were deconfirmed around launch time, mate
2015-12-15 22:48:12	Gamefreak75	i still held out hope, man
2015-12-15 22:48:20	Gamefreak75	maybe in smash 5
2015-12-15 22:52:02	En_Passant	Maybe Isaac will be there too
2015-12-15 22:52:08	En_Passant	(and bring a game with him)
2015-12-15 22:55:03	En_Passant	oh, Bayonetta only won in Europe

2015-12-16 19:11:38	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-12-16 19:11:39	Testyo	well, that's what happens, not only is that apostrophe wrong
2015-12-16 19:21:21	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-16 19:23:36	@J	today at work I was reading some planning I'd written out a while back
2015-12-16 19:23:46	@J	in the middle there's just a random error message dumped into the text
2015-12-16 19:23:52	@J	'Unknown macro: { some stuff}'
2015-12-16 19:24:02	@J	and it looks like a chunk of text is missing
2015-12-16 19:24:10	@J	no idea how that happened
2015-12-16 19:27:04	@Espyo	heh, brilliant
2015-12-16 19:27:11	@Espyo	must've been elaborate then
2015-12-16 19:27:23	@Espyo	why would you use macros for a simple plan?
2015-12-16 19:29:03	@J	maybe I was using vim
2015-12-16 19:29:06	@J	and suddenly macros
2015-12-16 19:29:07	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-16 19:29:36	@J	not that I really know how to use macros in vim
2015-12-16 19:29:44	@J	but press a load of random keys and anything can happen
2015-12-16 19:30:15	@Espyo	that's why I use nano
2015-12-16 19:30:17	@Espyo	no random keys there
2015-12-16 19:30:24	@Espyo	everything's on the screen
2015-12-16 19:30:26	@Espyo	and typing actually types
2015-12-16 19:30:55	Yoshi2	oh yes, if I'm not in edit mode and I accidently press keys in vim, weird stuff happens
2015-12-16 19:31:16	@Espyo	I'm just terrified of vim
2015-12-16 19:45:48	@Espyo	I just realized
2015-12-16 19:45:51	@Espyo	we have polls on the front page
2015-12-16 19:45:57	@Espyo	but we don't have the results of the previous poll
2015-12-16 19:46:11	@Espyo	we have a link saying "Older polls..." that takes you to all of them, but that's not convenient at all
2015-12-16 19:46:20	@Espyo	damn, it's so obvious in hindsight
2015-12-16 19:46:34	@Espyo	having all the results on the main page is overkill, imo, but at least putting the winner is a must
2015-12-16 19:46:41	@Espyo	anyway, I fixed that, but I'm not so sure about the style
2015-12-16 19:46:45	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Main_Page what do you guys think?
2015-12-16 19:47:42	Yoshi2	it works
2015-12-16 19:47:55	@Espyo	yeah, but it could probably deserve to look prettier

2015-12-16 20:12:34	@Espyo	...you probably have to go to Japan, learn the culture, develop insane connections and friendships, become a really great programmer, get hired by Nintendo, move up the chain until you have access to archives, and then get the source code
2015-12-16 20:13:02	Yoshi2	mhm, mhm
2015-12-16 20:13:12	Yoshi2	yeah, assembly would be easier

2015-12-17 18:56:07	@Espyo	ok
2015-12-17 18:56:46	@Espyo	so I've been pretty upset at wikia's stupidity over their attempts to fix non-existent portability issues
2015-12-17 18:56:58	@Espyo	and how they have stupid warnings about everything being broken everywhere
2015-12-17 18:57:12	@Espyo	but because I don't want to live in an echo chamber, I went to their page on the subject to learn if this is actually a legitimate thing
2015-12-17 18:57:15	@Espyo	I'm already regretting it
2015-12-17 18:57:24	@Espyo	“ Portability is important to WoWWiki, because we want it to look great on mobile as well as desktop browsers. “
2015-12-17 18:57:25	@Espyo	— Fandyllic, WoWWiki
2015-12-17 18:57:35	@Espyo	they chose that as the cover quote for the whole portability fixing movement
2015-12-17 18:57:44	@Espyo	...it's so inspirational, I might actually cry for the next few hours
2015-12-17 18:57:58	@Espyo	but anyway, then came this: "Did you know that more than half of Wikia's users visit our pages via a mobile device?"
2015-12-17 18:58:06	@Espyo	I bet my left nut on how that's completely false
2015-12-17 18:58:19	@Espyo	Pikipedia's mobile views are like 30%
2015-12-17 18:58:25	@Espyo	and it's a wiki like any other
2015-12-17 18:58:33	@Espyo	I honestly don't much trust that over half of the views come from mobile
2015-12-17 18:58:39	@Espyo	maybe with a HUGE asterisk
2015-12-17 19:00:53	@Espyo	...it barely changes anything
2015-12-17 19:00:56	@Espyo	http://portability.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Infoboxes#Layout_options this is the main change
2015-12-17 19:01:11	@Espyo	you save like 20 pixels
2015-12-17 19:01:45	@Espyo	and they're now treating infoboxes as if they're their own special thing, like bold, italics, or an image
2015-12-17 19:01:58	@Espyo	this only makes me happy
2015-12-17 19:02:02	@Espyo	let them destroy themselves
2015-12-17 19:10:16	Yoshi2	I have no trouble reading the tcrf wiki on my phone
2015-12-17 19:10:27	Yoshi2	just hold the phone horizontally and you will be fine
2015-12-17 19:12:26	@Espyo	and there ARE ways to improve mobile experience
2015-12-17 19:12:30	@Espyo	ever tried using Pikipedia on mobile?
2015-12-17 19:12:40	@Espyo	we've had rules for mobile for the past, what, 3 years?

2015-12-18 12:56:03	@Espyo	probably
2015-12-18 12:56:10	@Espyo	but he knew what he was doing, so it didn't take him that long
2015-12-18 12:56:59	Yoshi2	I wonder if I can avoid having to disassemble the entire game by only checking the places where the bms data is loaded
2015-12-18 12:57:33	@Espyo	very likely
2015-12-18 13:00:47	Yoshi2	worth a try
2015-12-18 13:01:49	@Espyo	oh, found it https://tcrf.net/Help:Contents/Finding_Content/Genesis_research_guide
2015-12-18 13:03:16	@Espyo	hm, not really assembly...
2015-12-18 13:06:04	Yoshi2	that guide kinda makes sense
2015-12-18 13:06:33	Yoshi2	a bit of voodoo magic is involved though
2015-12-18 13:07:15	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-18 13:09:32	Yoshi2	the basic idea seems to be that you go from something that can be easily found (strings) to something that can't be found that easily (addresses for code/entry points)
2015-12-18 13:09:43	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-18 13:09:49	@Espyo	looking at it again, it doesn't seem that bad
2015-12-18 13:09:55	@Espyo	but at the time, boy howdy
2015-12-18 13:10:06	@Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQ41d1Cz0g also, I never realized how close the speedrunners are to sub-1 hour
2015-12-18 13:11:44	Yoshi2	wow, that's very close
2015-12-18 13:13:28	@Espyo	hm, I do wonder what version is the fastest
2015-12-18 13:13:46	@Espyo	currently, the world records have the Japanese versions as the fastest
2015-12-18 13:13:50	@Espyo	I don't think it's because of the game
2015-12-18 13:14:05	@Espyo	heck, the only thing that makes Japanese runs faster is the text being shorter
2015-12-18 13:14:10	@Espyo	but you can skip all text anyway
2015-12-18 13:14:23	@Espyo	so the Japanese version doesn't have the sunset cutscene skipping, and has the final ship part weigh a lot more
2015-12-18 13:14:31	@Espyo	I don't think the Japanese version creates the fastest runs
2015-12-18 13:14:42	@Espyo	this run on an European copy, skipping the sunset cutscenes, would be sub-1

2015-12-18 14:13:22	Miles	It only runs at 50
2015-12-18 14:13:27	Miles	So PAL is horribly slow
2015-12-18 14:15:09	@J	does that even affect modern games?
2015-12-18 14:15:14	@J	well, 'modern'
2015-12-18 14:15:36	@J	I mean, do they even tie the frame rate to the physics/engine tick rate
2015-12-18 14:15:43	Miles	Depends on the game

2015-12-18 14:41:04	@Espyo	most games don't nowadays
2015-12-18 14:41:10	@Espyo	...but Fallout 4 did
2015-12-18 14:41:21	@Espyo	on really powerful PCs, some physics broke because the game runs at 100+ fps
2015-12-18 14:41:27	@Espyo	anyway yeah, completely forgot about the framerate
2015-12-18 14:41:40	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 DOES compensate for 50Hz, right?
2015-12-18 14:45:26	@J	Pikmin 2 has PAL 60
2015-12-18 14:45:46	@J	so does Wii, but I don't know if that works with all GameCube games?
2015-12-18 14:45:51	@J	not sure how it would
2015-12-18 14:46:35	@J	the Fallout thing sounds like those old games you have trouble running nowadays, where they just ran at full speed
2015-12-18 14:46:49	@J	so they're tens of times too fast on modern hardware

2015-12-18 14:57:01	Yoshi2	J: it's probably even worse with some old games, because those run as fast as the cpu allows them to
2015-12-18 14:58:08	Yoshi2	while fallout 4 "only" caps the physics to the frame rate
2015-12-18 14:58:13	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-18 14:58:38	@Espyo	some games even have a mix of the two ways

2015-12-18 15:06:42	@J	you could say it's not an oversight because of course they considered and tested that Blue Pikmin should be burned by a lit Fiery Bulblax
2015-12-18 15:06:51	@J	but you could say it is, because they didn't test this case
2015-12-18 15:07:07	@J	so I'd just say glitch
2015-12-18 15:09:29	@Espyo	well, it's an oversight in that they overlooked the possibility of the Pikmin already being on the Bulblax when the fire returns

2015-12-18 16:03:22	Yoshi2	ah, it does
2015-12-18 16:03:54	Yoshi2	just need to execute it with -d
2015-12-18 16:05:12	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-18 16:05:15	@Espyo	sorry, was busy talking
2015-12-18 16:05:52	Yoshi2	no problem
2015-12-18 16:06:36	Yoshi2	I'd pay somebody to watch video tutorials and write down what actually happens in them
2015-12-18 16:07:00	Yoshi2	they often take too long to explain simple things
2015-12-18 16:09:07	Yoshi2	I have no idea where to start, but this debugger looks pretty cool
2015-12-18 16:09:32	@Espyo	haha
2015-12-18 16:09:38	@Espyo	yeah, it's pretty spiffy
2015-12-18 16:10:29	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is a guide on what the commands mean
2015-12-18 16:13:08	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is a guide on what anything means in this debugger
2015-12-18 16:13:42	Yoshi2	it also seems I'm running pikmin 2 step by step now
2015-12-18 16:15:18	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-18 16:15:19	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-18 16:16:20	Yoshi2	oh, I can just press start and keep the game running
2015-12-18 16:17:58	@Espyo	yeah, I got confused with that at first, too
2015-12-18 16:18:04	@Espyo	it starts off paused
2015-12-18 16:23:20	Yoshi2	https://de.dolphin-emu.org/docs/guides/?cr=de zzzz, no guide about debugging
2015-12-18 16:32:57	@Espyo	nuts
2015-12-18 16:33:16	@Espyo	I would love to get how debugging works, too
2015-12-18 16:33:33	@Espyo	it'd allow us to learn stuff like the chances of X, Y, or Z coming out of an egg
2015-12-18 16:34:03	@Espyo	uhm, I mean the chances of X, Y, or Z coming out of a petrified enemy
2015-12-18 16:34:09	@Espyo	I couldn't remember which of the two we had exact values for
2015-12-18 16:34:13	@Espyo	turns out it's the eggs
2015-12-18 16:34:17	@Espyo	it's right there on the game's files
2015-12-18 16:34:27	@Espyo	but the chances for a petrified death aren't
2015-12-18 16:34:48	Chiaki_Nanami	because Pikmin 2 making sense would just be too much to ask for
2015-12-18 16:34:59	Yoshi2	yup
2015-12-18 16:35:04	Yoshi2	pikmin 2 is such a mystery
2015-12-18 16:35:40	Chiaki_Nanami	I can't remember if I've asked this before but do P1 and P3 make sense?
2015-12-18 16:35:50	Chiaki_Nanami	is it just P2 that doesn't make one iota of sense?
2015-12-18 16:38:08	Yoshi2	p1 is a bit better structured than p2, not sure if it makes more sense though
2015-12-18 16:41:27	@Espyo	yeah, it's slightly better structured
2015-12-18 16:41:36	@Espyo	but we can't really open most of its files or data
2015-12-18 16:41:38	@Espyo	so we can't really tell
2015-12-18 16:41:47	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 is the one that makes the most sense, by far
2015-12-18 16:41:57	@Espyo	but every once in a while, it still pulls off something that'll make you go wtf
2015-12-18 16:47:28	Yoshi2	currently reading through http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Assembler_Tutorial and some of the stuff is making quite a bit of sense
2015-12-18 16:48:51	@Espyo	that's a relief
2015-12-18 16:49:07	@Espyo	my biggest fear is that you might read through like 20 assembly instructions
2015-12-18 16:49:18	@Espyo	not understanding what the variables it means are, nor the calls it's making
2015-12-18 16:49:22	@Espyo	wonder about its majesty
2015-12-18 16:49:32	@Espyo	and after 30 minutes, reach the conclusion that it's just something like a square root
2015-12-18 16:49:42	@Espyo	in code, a square root is so ridiculously easy
2015-12-18 16:49:45	@Espyo	but turn that to assembly...
2015-12-18 16:49:58	@Espyo	plus, on top of that, I'm scared of imagining how hard it must be to even REACH the part of the code you want
2015-12-18 16:50:12	@Espyo	per frame, there's probably dozens of millions of instructions
2015-12-18 16:50:16	@Espyo	in that sea, how are you supposed to know?
2015-12-18 16:50:20	Yoshi2	yup
2015-12-18 16:51:09	@Espyo	but... with experience, it might be easy
2015-12-18 16:52:13	Yoshi2	mhm, I might be lacking a bit in that aspect
2015-12-18 16:53:27	Yoshi2	most of my experience in working closely with hardware comes from my uni course
2015-12-18 16:54:28	@Espyo	most of my experience is a half-year subject at college
2015-12-18 16:54:34	@Espyo	can't say I didn't learn anything from it
2015-12-18 16:54:37	@Espyo	it was actually a bit fun
2015-12-18 16:54:44	@Espyo	but if I had to dive into assembly suddenly, I'd have a hard time
2015-12-18 16:54:54	Yoshi2	and that micro controller has only a single cpu that has less than 1/10th the cpu frequency of the gamecube
2015-12-18 16:55:05	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-12-18 16:55:14	Yoshi2	and even then, I haven't worked with assembly but with C
2015-12-18 16:55:35	@Espyo	yeah, not really the same, at all
2015-12-18 16:55:46	@Espyo	although between working with C and C++, C is better to understand assembly with
2015-12-18 16:55:53	@Espyo	more low-level
2015-12-18 16:58:09	@Espyo	what
2015-12-18 16:58:21	@Espyo	while trying to burn two Blue Pikmin to see if spicies die quicker
2015-12-18 16:58:26	@Espyo	they walked through the fire without getting burned
2015-12-18 17:00:09	Yoshi2	voodoo magic
2015-12-18 17:07:19	Yoshi2	reading this assembler documentation, it really shows that the cpu uses a risc architecture
2015-12-18 17:07:32	Yoshi2	there aren't that many different instructions
2015-12-18 17:08:24	@Espyo	nice
2015-12-18 17:08:44	@Espyo	...I went through the engine's files, on visual studio, and did a replace all for a word that appears in all of them
2015-12-18 17:08:56	@Espyo	the replace all took around a minute
2015-12-18 17:09:03	@Espyo	then I saved all files with the save all button
2015-12-18 17:09:12	@Espyo	I have an addon that runs a formatter every time I save a file
2015-12-18 17:09:16	@Espyo	the save all took 5 seconds
2015-12-18 17:09:17	@Espyo	...
2015-12-18 17:09:37	@Espyo	it was a LOT faster to run through an entire document, use a parser and lexer, run countless rules for style, and then save
2015-12-18 17:09:45	@Espyo	than it was to run the document, find a word, replace it, and save
2015-12-18 17:10:09	@Espyo	you could say that because the files were recently opened, some sort of cache on the disk is to thank for the speed
2015-12-18 17:10:25	@Espyo	but over 10 times faster? for an operation that should be over 10 times more complex?
2015-12-18 17:10:25	Yoshi2	visual studio, or at least the variant we use for micro controller programming, manages to be very slow somehow
2015-12-18 17:10:32	@Espyo	yeah, it's insane
2015-12-18 17:10:37	@Espyo	it's finding/replacing and intellisense
2015-12-18 17:10:51	@Espyo	intellisense is that thing that knows what variables exist and all
2015-12-18 17:10:59	@Espyo	and when you start typing an_object.
2015-12-18 17:11:05	@Espyo	it suggests what to put ahead of the dot
2015-12-18 17:11:09	@Espyo	lists the members and all
2015-12-18 17:11:17	@Espyo	but so help you, if you change the code in any way
2015-12-18 17:11:21	@Espyo	it has to rescan everything for the next 10 minutes

2015-12-18 17:12:00	@Espyo	at work, we use Codelite on Ubuntu, and although it doesn't like our engine's project, it likes my Pikmin engine's project
2015-12-18 17:12:14	@Espyo	so until I tried running the engine with Codelite, I never saw how Codelite's "intellisense" worked
2015-12-18 17:12:23	@Espyo	and would you look at that, it's instantaneous, always
2015-12-18 17:12:31	@Espyo	how did they manage to butcher visual studio so badly?
2015-12-18 17:14:34	Yoshi2	so the instructions can be broken down into the following groups
2015-12-18 17:14:40	Yoshi2	addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, loading, some floating point instructions, some binary operations, and branching/goto
2015-12-18 17:15:40	@Espyo	what about variable assignment and reading?
2015-12-18 17:16:26	Yoshi2	covered by loading
2015-12-18 17:16:39	Yoshi2	http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Assembler_Tutorial#Load_and_Store_Instructions
2015-12-18 17:17:32	@Espyo	ah
2015-12-18 17:18:52	Yoshi2	the instructions being straight-forward means that I will need to put much more effort into understanding what the instructions as a whole do
2015-12-18 17:19:01	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-12-18 17:19:04	@Espyo	I'm wondering though
2015-12-18 17:19:08	@Espyo	for as crazy as assembly is
2015-12-18 17:19:15	@Espyo	there ARE ways to handle it well
2015-12-18 17:19:23	@Espyo	I mean, you don't have to look any further than the Project M team
2015-12-18 17:19:31	@Espyo	they made that mod entirely by looking at the assembly and changing it
2015-12-18 17:19:55	@Espyo	and if I'm not mistakened, quite a bit of it was made on a Wii itself, with homebrew
2015-12-18 17:20:00	@Espyo	or with Action Replay
2015-12-18 17:20:10	@Espyo	which has horrible work conditions compared to using an emulator
2015-12-18 17:20:22	@Espyo	plus Wii should be a bit harder to work with than a GameCube
2015-12-18 17:20:24	@Espyo	so there IS hope
2015-12-18 17:20:33	@Espyo	that it can't be THAT insane
2015-12-18 17:20:41	@Espyo	...at least to get something basic
2015-12-18 17:20:48	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-12-18 17:20:49	@Espyo	maybe learning the entirety of how BMS works might be insane
2015-12-18 17:20:55	@Espyo	but it's always fun to try
2015-12-18 17:28:10	Yoshi2	this really seems like something that would be a lot of fun
2015-12-18 17:31:40	Yoshi2	now if only I had more time on my hands than I knew what to do with it, I'd probably actually work my way through the pikmin code
2015-12-18 17:31:50	Yoshi2	but alas, that is not the case, so I need to look for shortcuts
2015-12-18 17:40:57	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-18 18:29:14	Yoshi2	Espyo: ok, so here is my plan: I dump the ram, find the place where the filename strings are stored, get their pointers, and find the spot in the code where the pointers are used
2015-12-18 18:29:20	--	AFKazooie is now known as Pidgey
2015-12-18 18:33:08	Yoshi2	but the way the instructions work, the pointer won't fit into a single instruction
2015-12-18 18:34:09	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-18 18:35:49	Yoshi2	ugh, this will not be very easy
2015-12-18 18:39:31	Yoshi2	I also forgot which file belongs to which melody in the game
2015-12-18 18:44:13	@Espyo	yikes, yeah
2015-12-18 18:44:45	Yoshi2	I also need a better player for playing midi files
2015-12-18 18:45:19	@Espyo	for windows, foobar works ok, imo
2015-12-18 18:51:16	@Espyo	oh, I didn't realize Metroid Prime 3's Hyper Mode is literally incompletable
2015-12-18 18:51:40	@Espyo	when you have to disable the pirate defense system after you get the nova beam
2015-12-18 18:51:53	@Espyo	you need to use the x-ray visor to see where the sweetspots of the tower you're shooting at are
2015-12-18 18:52:03	@Espyo	but you can't turn on the x-ray visor since the enemies in hyper mode block it
2015-12-18 18:52:09	@Espyo	and sure, I can defeat them
2015-12-18 18:52:17	@Espyo	but they respawn too quickly for me to be able to do anything
2015-12-18 18:55:17	Yoshi2	Espyo: foobar has no midi functionality out of the box, I think
2015-12-18 18:55:40	@Espyo	oh, I think you're right
2015-12-18 18:56:01	Yoshi2	have to download a plugin for that

2015-12-18 19:06:45	@Espyo	oh, I had to shoot anyway
2015-12-18 19:06:48	@Espyo	even though all I can see is static
2015-12-18 19:06:49	@Espyo	terrific
2015-12-18 19:15:30	Yoshi2	ok, I guess book.bms is the file for the piklopedia
2015-12-18 19:16:35	Yoshi2	time to search for pointers
2015-12-18 19:17:21	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-18 19:18:43	Yoshi2	actually
2015-12-18 19:18:57	Yoshi2	what the hell, I should just search for the content of that file
2015-12-18 19:19:02	Yoshi2	skipping a few things
2015-12-18 19:19:11	Yoshi2	*steps
2015-12-18 19:24:24	Yoshi2	hehehe, found it
2015-12-18 19:25:05	Yoshi2	0x00F1E940
2015-12-18 19:25:09	Yoshi2	so I don't lose it
2015-12-18 19:33:16	Yoshi2	as cool as this debugger is
2015-12-18 19:33:25	Yoshi2	I wish its search function wasn't so primitive
2015-12-18 19:34:46	Yoshi2	actually, nevermind
2015-12-18 19:35:00	Yoshi2	I can specify the address to start searching from

2015-12-18 19:44:48	@Espyo	drat
2015-12-18 19:45:12	Yoshi2	or maybe it is possible and I'm just stupid

2015-12-18 19:57:59	@Espyo	oh really?
2015-12-18 19:58:06	@Espyo	so it can generate code out of assembly?
2015-12-18 19:58:11	@Espyo	well, not documented, I bet
2015-12-18 19:58:17	@Espyo	so variables and functions don't have names
2015-12-18 19:58:26	@Espyo	but it can translate to code, is that it?
2015-12-18 20:00:03	Yoshi2	Espyo: it's still assembler, but it prefixes each line of code with some sort of identifier
2015-12-18 20:00:21	Yoshi2	so I guess code with the same identifier belong to a single "function"

2015-12-18 20:12:27	Yoshi2	well, this is fun
2015-12-18 20:12:40	Yoshi2	dolphin doesn't support 32 bit systems anymore
2015-12-18 20:13:03	Yoshi2	which means I can't go ahead and compile the newest version of dolphin

2015-12-18 20:17:10	Yoshi2	pretty annoying because my computer still only runs 32 bit vista
2015-12-18 20:17:47	@Espyo	I would say that it might be worth a shot to compile on 32-bit anyway
2015-12-18 20:17:50	@Espyo	but then I remembered
2015-12-18 20:17:59	@Espyo	compiling anything under windows is never worth any shot

2015-12-18 20:19:24	@Espyo	sorry
2015-12-18 20:19:29	Yoshi2	I actually have linux 64 bit installed
2015-12-18 20:19:34	@Espyo	never a bad thing
2015-12-18 20:19:36	Yoshi2	so I guess I could use that
2015-12-18 20:19:38	@Espyo	why do you want the latest version anyway?
2015-12-18 20:19:57	Yoshi2	less effort to pick out a build to compile
2015-12-18 20:20:13	Yoshi2	I want memory breakpoints, and it seems I need to recompile dolphin for that with a flag set
2015-12-18 20:20:21	@Espyo	aww geez
2015-12-18 20:22:34	@Espyo	looking through the history of that page, it looks like it always did say 64-bit
2015-12-18 20:22:49	@Espyo	I was hoping that it only got changed to 64-only recently

2015-12-18 20:26:45	UltraMario	because it sux
2015-12-18 20:26:45	Yoshi2	vista isn't that bad
2015-12-18 20:27:04	Yoshi2	with the newest service packs, it is actually usable
2015-12-18 20:27:27	Yoshi2	though now it is very old and doesn't receive updates, so I need to replace the OS sometime
2015-12-18 20:28:37	@Espyo	I saw this coming a mile away
2015-12-18 20:28:46	@Espyo	just to get some disassembly done, you'd need hours of work to even start
2015-12-18 20:28:53	@Espyo	let's hope it's worth it, though
2015-12-18 20:29:08	Yoshi2	yuuuup
2015-12-18 20:29:35	Yoshi2	well, technically the disassembly isn't an issue
2015-12-18 20:29:40	Yoshi2	I just need to find the right spot
2015-12-18 20:29:55	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-18 20:31:21	Yoshi2	well, tomorrow I'll try to compile the stable build on vista, and if that doesn't work I'll go back to linux

2015-12-19 12:27:16	Yoshi2	Espyo: seems like I'm out of luck with compiling the emulator on windows
2015-12-19 12:27:24	@Espyo	darn
2015-12-19 12:27:25	Yoshi2	visual studio 2013 doesn't support vista
2015-12-19 12:27:31	Yoshi2	sooo linux it is
2015-12-19 12:27:33	@Espyo	that... doesn't sound right
2015-12-19 12:28:34	Yoshi2	nothing ever sounds right
2015-12-19 12:28:41	--	Cinnamon_Pi is now known as AFKazooie
2015-12-19 12:29:10	@Espyo	well, can't say no to that
2015-12-19 12:46:40	Yoshi2	well, I'm pretty sure I once tried to install vs 2013 and couldn't do it
2015-12-19 12:46:54	Yoshi2	so before I start downloading 6 gb for nothing, I'll just do it in linux
2015-12-19 12:51:09	@Espyo	I was going to say "maybe it's worth trying again"
2015-12-19 12:51:14	@Espyo	but yeeeeeeaaaaah, 6gb
2015-12-19 12:51:19	@Espyo	go forth in Linux
2015-12-19 13:00:14	Yoshi2	visual studio is so huge, it could become its own category for "ur mom" jokes
2015-12-19 13:01:10	@Espyo	ur mom's so fat, even visual studio takes up less space
2015-12-19 13:22:33	Yoshi2	now, how do I build dolphin on linux
2015-12-19 13:25:04	@Espyo	there was a page on the wiki
2015-12-19 13:30:13	Yoshi2	this will be fun
2015-12-19 13:37:44	Yoshi2	alright, I think I got it
2015-12-19 13:39:28	Yoshi2	hm, compiling dolphin seems to take a million years
2015-12-19 13:40:25	Yoshi2	I guess it is a big project
2015-12-19 13:41:21	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-19 13:41:24	@Espyo	but hey, as long as it works
2015-12-19 13:47:09	Yoshi2	hopefully it works
2015-12-19 13:58:18	Yoshi2	Espyo: the fun part is that once this is compiled and it works, I will need to compile it again because there is a flag I need to set
2015-12-19 13:58:33	@Espyo	you didn't set the flag right away?
2015-12-19 13:59:36	Yoshi2	well, I wanted to see that it can compile without issues first
2015-12-19 13:59:48	Yoshi2	and then do experimental stuff
2015-12-19 14:01:51	@Espyo	I guess
2015-12-19 14:03:56	Yoshi2	also, I noped away a bit when I saw the makefile
2015-12-19 14:04:38	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-19 14:05:42	Yoshi2	alright, this is not very good
2015-12-19 14:13:15	Yoshi2	I guess I missed one step
2015-12-19 14:13:21	Yoshi2	half an hour wasted
2015-12-19 14:17:22	Yoshi2	oh for hell's sake, this doesn't want to work
2015-12-19 14:19:09	@Espyo	hey, you're compiling on C++
2015-12-19 14:19:13	@Espyo	if you really did miss one step only
2015-12-19 14:19:15	@Espyo	consider yourself lucky
2015-12-19 14:21:42	Yoshi2	apparently the issue is that I need to use gcc 4.9
2015-12-19 14:22:50	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-12-19 14:45:58	Yoshi2	I'll just upgrade everything on my system
2015-12-19 14:46:02	Yoshi2	then try again

2015-12-19 16:44:33	Yoshi2	now to see if it works
2015-12-19 16:47:55	Yoshi2	it works, woohoo
2015-12-19 17:04:32	@Espyo	nice!
2015-12-19 17:04:47	@Espyo	now, I don't feel setting the flag will be that big of a deal
2015-12-19 17:04:53	@Espyo	you should be able to compile just fine anyway
2015-12-19 17:36:36	Yoshi2	probably
2015-12-19 17:36:55	Yoshi2	I have this feeling that the newest version of dolphin has much, much better debugging capabilities
2015-12-19 17:47:17	@Espyo	mhm
2015-12-19 17:47:22	Yoshi2	Espyo: it nows shows me the value that was inside the register at the time of the execution of the instruction
2015-12-19 17:47:40	Yoshi2	making it much more useful
2015-12-19 17:48:14	@Espyo	oh, terrific

2015-12-19 18:48:13	Yoshi2	I probably could make a cheat code which corrupts the melody
2015-12-19 18:48:14	@Espyo	nice, nice
2015-12-19 18:48:28	@Espyo	you're making an insane amount of progress
2015-12-19 18:48:40	@Espyo	and if you cut out the time you've spent building Dolphin and other stupid things, it's pretty incredible
2015-12-19 18:48:49	Yoshi2	it's really not that much progress
2015-12-19 18:48:57	Yoshi2	I'm currently redoing everything I did yesterday
2015-12-19 18:49:04	@Espyo	sure? it feels like more than what I think I'd get
2015-12-19 18:49:16	@Espyo	maybe what you've got is easier than I'm thinking
2015-12-19 18:49:21	@Espyo	but it feels like it's good progress so far
2015-12-19 18:49:31	Yoshi2	it's only progress if my idea works out
2015-12-19 18:49:50	Yoshi2	the idea is that somewhere in the code should be the pointer to this spot of data
2015-12-19 18:50:00	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-19 18:50:01	Yoshi2	if I find that pointer, jackpot

2015-12-19 19:14:34	@Espyo	good thing you compiled, then
2015-12-19 19:17:23	Yoshi2	I'm actually not sure if I set the flag correctly
2015-12-19 19:26:58	@Espyo	did you put it on the makefile's CXXFLAGS?
2015-12-19 19:27:38	Yoshi2	no, I set it on the same line as executing cmake
2015-12-19 19:27:51	@Espyo	isn't there a makefile?
2015-12-19 19:27:55	Yoshi2	aaaaaaaand dolphin crashed due to segmentation fault
2015-12-19 19:27:57	Yoshi2	there is
2015-12-19 19:28:13	@Espyo	did the instructions tell you to use the flag on cmake?
2015-12-19 19:28:36	Yoshi2	dolphin says DebugFast in the title, so I guess it worked
2015-12-19 19:28:52	Yoshi2	and I saw something about memory breakpoints, but dolphin segfaulted

2015-12-20 01:12:22	@PikFan	is there anyone on Skype right now?
2015-12-20 01:12:28	@Espyo	not many people, actually
2015-12-20 01:12:30	@Espyo	there's usually a bunch
2015-12-20 01:12:36	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-20 01:13:06	@PikFan	don't they have a Mario Kart 8 group?
2015-12-20 01:13:25	@PikFan	because I was going to ask if I could join that
2015-12-20 01:15:50	@Espyo	not really
2015-12-20 01:15:53	@Espyo	but they play sometimes
2015-12-20 01:16:04	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-20 01:16:40	@PikFan	don't they also play Splatoon together? it's likely I'll be getting Splatoon for Christmas
2015-12-20 01:20:39	@Espyo	they do
2015-12-20 01:20:44	@Espyo	but you can join the Inkipedia chat too

2015-12-20 01:28:29	@PikFan	really? you're going to harass Scruffy over renders, but you can't be bothered to give your opinion on something that's going to affect the whole wiki?
2015-12-20 01:28:36	@PikFan	I put the link in red, and made it huge
2015-12-20 01:28:43	@PikFan	and still only 1% of users care
2015-12-20 01:28:45	@PikFan	sheesh...
2015-12-20 01:29:07	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-20 01:29:25	@PikFan	I don't get it
2015-12-20 01:29:36	@PikFan	people are usually attracted to giant warning signs
2015-12-20 01:30:16	@PikFan	but lolno, I'm sorry, I'm not giving you my opinion, I'm too busy not caring about the wiki
2015-12-20 01:30:18	@PikFan	>_>
2015-12-20 01:31:00	@PikFan	well, if anybody complains about their article being deleted, I'm not listening to them
2015-12-20 01:31:25	@PikFan	because there was a very obvious link in the sitenotice talking about that

2015-12-20 02:16:10	Testyo	I said >_< what about making one? Or is there a fanoner, yes because Goodolph mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages I think he's a fanoner, yes and >_< what about making one? Or is there a pre-made one?. They were joined by the common word a.
2015-12-20 02:26:26	@PikFan	2015-12-17 18:56:46	@Espyo	so I've been pretty upset at wikia's stupidity over their attempts to fix non-existent portability issues
2015-12-20 02:26:34	@PikFan	huh? I don't understand
2015-12-20 02:26:40	@PikFan	what is a portability issue?
2015-12-20 02:26:40	@Espyo	read what comes next
2015-12-20 02:26:44	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-20 02:26:45	@PikFan	I am
2015-12-20 02:26:51	@Espyo	wikia has this thing now
2015-12-20 02:26:58	@Espyo	where they put a warning on all wikias
2015-12-20 02:27:02	@Espyo	saying their infoboxes are not portbale
2015-12-20 02:27:04	@Espyo	*portable
2015-12-20 02:27:08	@Espyo	in that they show up badly on mobile
2015-12-20 02:27:18	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-12-20 02:27:23	@Espyo	and editors need to go through this process to make them look good both on desktop and mobile
2015-12-20 02:27:27	@Espyo	which is complete garbage
2015-12-20 02:27:30	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-20 02:27:34	@Espyo	our infoboxes were always great in either place
2015-12-20 02:27:38	@PikFan	do our infoboxes look bad on — oh
2015-12-20 02:28:04	@Espyo	and when we added the style for mobile, we changed the appearance of infoboxes for mobile
2015-12-20 02:28:06	@Espyo	and it works wonders
2015-12-20 02:28:16	@Espyo	so wikia made this overcomplicated system because they're idiots
2015-12-20 02:28:25	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-20 02:28:47	@PikFan	too bad that they won't disappear anytime soon
2015-12-20 02:28:51	@PikFan	sigh...
2015-12-20 02:31:54	@Espyo	it's okay
2015-12-20 02:31:57	@Espyo	let them self-destruct
2015-12-20 02:31:59	@Espyo	this change is so stupid
2015-12-20 02:32:04	@Espyo	and a pain to editors and viewers alike
2015-12-20 02:32:14	@Espyo	(yeah, the warnings are swarmed everywhere, which is an eyesore if you're a viewer)
2015-12-20 02:32:19	@Espyo	maybe more people will realize wikia sucks
2015-12-20 02:32:33	@PikFan	that RRabbit guy probably likes the change because he's an idiot
2015-12-20 02:32:36	@PikFan	like the wikia staff
2015-12-20 02:33:48	@PikFan	speaking of him, I was looking on kirbyddd's talk the other day
2015-12-20 02:33:51	@PikFan	saw this
2015-12-20 02:33:56	@PikFan	"... when the former admins moved to their own wiki, they didn't lift the house off the foundation and move it to a different city like they think they did. The reality is that they made a copy of the house and all its contents and created a duplicate in that other city."
2015-12-20 02:34:00	@PikFan	hahahaha, no
2015-12-20 02:34:06	@PikFan	you fail to realize we MERGED
2015-12-20 02:35:05	@PikFan	I don't like wikia zealots like RRabbit and kirbyddd
2015-12-20 02:35:21	@PikFan	what's so great about wikia?
2015-12-20 02:35:22	@PikFan	nothing
2015-12-20 02:35:39	@PikFan	it's just a crappier copy of everything
2015-12-20 02:36:24	@PikFan	"I contacted Wikia to make them aware of the poor behavior of those people and asked what the procedure was for dealing with these kinds of situations."
2015-12-20 02:36:24	@Espyo	I think rrabit is hired by wikia
2015-12-20 02:36:26	@Espyo	as a staff
2015-12-20 02:36:30	@Espyo	as for the others
2015-12-20 02:36:33	@Espyo	human ego is a fragile thing
2015-12-20 02:36:45	@Espyo	tell them that their choice is wrong, and they do everything they can to make sure that that's not true
2015-12-20 02:36:55	@PikFan	oh, so by "poor behavior", you mean trying to increase our awareness of the superior, higher-quality wiki?
2015-12-20 02:36:57	@PikFan	rubbish
2015-12-20 02:37:00	@Espyo	even if it means going "la la la I can't hear you, obviously MY choice is the superior one"
2015-12-20 02:37:16	@PikFan	yeah, by blocking
2015-12-20 02:37:33	@PikFan	apparently he's a "Wikia Star"
2015-12-20 02:37:36	@PikFan	whatever that is
2015-12-20 02:37:55	@PikFan	well, their efforts are in vain
2015-12-20 02:38:04	@PikFan	they'll never catch up to our quality
2015-12-20 02:39:17	@PikFan	I also don't like how he keeps comparing wikis to giant businesses or whatever
2015-12-20 02:39:31	@PikFan	wikis are their own special things, different from anything he mentioned
2015-12-20 02:39:51	@PikFan	there's no need to have two places with copies of the information
2015-12-20 02:40:34	@PikFan	his logic irritates me
2015-12-20 02:41:43	@Espyo	it is a business to them
2015-12-20 02:41:49	@Espyo	for the people that actually care, it's not
2015-12-20 02:41:54	@Espyo	it's an encyclopedia
2015-12-20 02:42:17	@Espyo	where are you getting these quotes from?
2015-12-20 02:42:52	@PikFan	kirbyddd's talk page
2015-12-20 02:42:58	@PikFan	or, as I should say, message wall
2015-12-20 02:46:24	@Espyo	hmm, when I was scouting around for changes on the wikia, for the past half-year, I didn't notice these conversations on the recent changes
2015-12-20 02:46:52	@PikFan	odd
2015-12-20 02:51:05	@PikFan	okay, maybe there's some truth to his argument
2015-12-20 02:51:23	@PikFan	maybe there can be multiple sources of information, if they cover wide and vast subjects
2015-12-20 02:51:40	@PikFan	like Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britticana 
2015-12-20 02:51:51	@PikFan	but for small, obscure things like Pikmin?
2015-12-20 02:52:03	@PikFan	why bother having two encyclopedias for Pikmin?

2015-12-20 02:53:24	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-20 02:54:15	@PikFan	oh, so I've been thinking
2015-12-20 02:54:29	@PikFan	remember how people copied TCRF's content onto wikia?
2015-12-20 02:55:02	@PikFan	I'm worried that somebody editing on wikia see's something they like
2015-12-20 02:55:02	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2015-12-20 02:55:06	@PikFan	say the cave units
2015-12-20 02:55:11	@PikFan	and decides to copy those over
2015-12-20 02:55:15	@PikFan	what would you do?
2015-12-20 02:55:15	@Espyo	yeah, I've had that worry too
2015-12-20 02:55:19	@Espyo	in fact, copying EVERYTHING
2015-12-20 02:55:23	@Espyo	there's nothing we can do
2015-12-20 02:55:32	@PikFan	...nothing?
2015-12-20 02:55:35	@Espyo	not really
2015-12-20 02:55:41	@PikFan	is it because of that license?
2015-12-20 02:55:46	@Espyo	except add to our repository of nasty thins wikia does
2015-12-20 02:55:47	@Espyo	yes
2015-12-20 02:55:57	@PikFan	ugh
2015-12-20 02:56:09	@Espyo	there's been no real case of that happening, anywhere
2015-12-20 02:56:09	@PikFan	that license is good and bad
2015-12-20 02:56:10	@Espyo	so...
2015-12-20 02:56:20	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-20 02:56:27	@PikFan	well, at least they have some decency
2015-12-20 02:56:34	@PikFan	even if it's minute
2015-12-20 02:56:53	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-20 02:57:06	@Espyo	I know we can reach Smash Wiki status

2015-12-20 02:57:17	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-20 02:57:20	@Espyo	at that point, we have nothing to worry about

2015-12-20 02:57:25	@PikFan	isn't Smash Wiki really, really good?

2015-12-20 02:57:48	@Espyo	but I haven't checked the wikia

2015-12-20 16:19:52	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-12-20 16:19:53	Testyo	people can't see that case your ISP does suck
2015-12-20 16:19:58	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-20 16:21:24	Yoshi2	Espyo: so I compiled the stable branch, and the segfault when setting memory breaks still happens
2015-12-20 16:21:31	Yoshi2	I do have some good news
2015-12-20 16:21:43	Yoshi2	I figured out how to do memory breaks without that memory break feature
2015-12-20 16:21:48	@Espyo	oh, nice, at least
2015-12-20 16:22:06	Yoshi2	requires adding code to the source and then compiling it
2015-12-20 16:22:23	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-20 16:22:24	@Espyo	well then
2015-12-20 16:22:49	Yoshi2	I just need to make sure I added the code in the right place
2015-12-20 16:23:26	Yoshi2	I'm currently trying to compile the old dolphin branch to see if that segfaults too
2015-12-20 16:23:36	Yoshi2	need to fix compile errors though, fun times
2015-12-20 16:24:45	@Espyo	bleh

2015-12-20 16:43:19	Yoshi2	ok, I guess this error could be fixed if I somehow installed polarssl
2015-12-20 16:45:11	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-20 16:47:26	Yoshi2	so far, getting memory breaks to work has been such a fun rollercoaster ride
2015-12-20 16:49:16	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-20 16:49:18	@Espyo	I bet
2015-12-20 16:49:42	Yoshi2	polarssl needs to be installed too, of course
2015-12-20 16:52:59	Yoshi2	ok, I installed polarssl now, let's see if dolphin builds without issues now
2015-12-20 16:53:38	Yoshi2	fun fact: the newest versions of polarssl are actually called mbedtls
2015-12-20 16:54:13	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-20 16:54:15	Yoshi2	but I didn't want to install those because there would probably be all sorts of issues with the dolphin code looking for a specific package
2015-12-20 16:54:44	Yoshi2	hype
2015-12-20 16:55:06	Yoshi2	the build process is past the point where it crashed last time now
2015-12-20 16:58:55	Yoshi2	GOD
2015-12-20 16:58:56	Yoshi2	NO
2015-12-20 16:59:01	Yoshi2	94% and it failed
2015-12-20 17:04:40	@Espyo	damn!

2015-12-20 17:29:03	Yoshi2	somehow, removing the build files and compiling it from scratch again seems to work often
2015-12-20 17:31:37	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-20 17:31:39	@Espyo	specially on Linux
2015-12-20 17:31:45	Yoshi2	Espyo: oh god, this old version has issues with starting up pikmin 2
2015-12-20 17:31:58	@Espyo	yikes
2015-12-20 17:40:05	Yoshi2	well, this was a waste of time ヽ(°▽ °)ノ

2015-12-20 17:42:38	Yoshi2	luckily, rolling back to the newer versions is not difficult because I have those built already
2015-12-20 17:49:05	Yoshi2	well, I actually did figure out one thing, which is that code and memory breakpoints can be set by clicking on the white space to the left of the address
2015-12-20 17:49:42	@Espyo	even with the usual version of Dolphin?
2015-12-20 17:49:46	Yoshi2	yup
2015-12-20 17:49:48	@Espyo	i.e. no recompile with special flags?
2015-12-20 17:49:52	@Espyo	...then was this a goose chase?
2015-12-20 17:49:55	Yoshi2	oh
2015-12-20 17:49:58	Yoshi2	not sure about that
2015-12-20 17:50:02	@Espyo	I can test
2015-12-20 17:50:04	@Espyo	one sec
2015-12-20 17:50:13	Yoshi2	the debug flag might still be required for memory breakpoints
2015-12-20 17:50:30	@Espyo	on Dolphin, which tab is this?
2015-12-20 17:50:34	@Espyo	Code, Breakpoints, or Memory?
2015-12-20 17:50:54	Yoshi2	Memory for memory breakpoints
2015-12-20 17:51:06	Yoshi2	the breakpoints tab mostly lists your breakpoints, I think
2015-12-20 17:51:43	@Espyo	nope, nothing happens if I click anywhere
2015-12-20 17:51:51	Yoshi2	odd
2015-12-20 17:52:02	Yoshi2	try the Code tab
2015-12-20 17:52:24	Yoshi2	also, your game needs to be paused
2015-12-20 17:52:59	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-20 17:53:00	@Espyo	code works!
2015-12-20 17:53:07	@Espyo	not memory, though
2015-12-20 17:53:11	Yoshi2	mhm
2015-12-20 17:53:12	@Espyo	a red square appears
2015-12-20 17:53:14	@Espyo	that's a breakpoint all right
2015-12-20 17:53:18	Yoshi2	so the debug flag is needed for memory breakpoints
2015-12-20 17:53:30	Yoshi2	memory breakpoints have a blue square
2015-12-20 17:53:34	@Espyo	right
2015-12-20 17:54:12	Yoshi2	setting memory breakpoints at least halves my performance
2015-12-20 17:54:23	@Espyo	well, that's expected
2015-12-20 17:54:49	Yoshi2	now I just need to set breakpoints in a way so that they actually work
2015-12-20 17:55:00	Yoshi2	... or I will need to use Interpreter instead of JIT
2015-12-20 17:55:05	Yoshi2	*shudders*
2015-12-20 17:55:15	@Espyo	eep
2015-12-20 17:57:19	Yoshi2	ugh
2015-12-20 17:57:23	Yoshi2	let's try interpreter
2015-12-20 17:57:30	Yoshi2	2-3 fps, here I come!
2015-12-20 17:57:53	Yoshi2	make that 1-2 fps
2015-12-20 17:58:03	@Espyo	good thing you don't really need gameplay for what you want
2015-12-20 17:58:08	Yoshi2	yup
2015-12-20 18:00:11	Yoshi2	I still need to get past the first few screens though
2015-12-20 18:00:21	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-20 18:00:32	@Espyo	you should make a save state on the main menu though
2015-12-20 18:01:36	Yoshi2	yup
2015-12-20 18:08:37	Yoshi2	I guess I'll go enjoy some videos or anime while the game progresses
2015-12-20 18:09:33	@Espyo	yeeeep
2015-12-20 18:10:41	Yoshi2	I knew interpreter was not very fast, but this
2015-12-20 18:10:44	Yoshi2	I did not expect this

2015-12-20 18:13:19	@Espyo	ok, this is definitely a reference to some real life gas
2015-12-20 18:13:21	@Espyo	but what, exactly...?
2015-12-20 18:14:16	Scruffy	Well you /can/ see it in the game
2015-12-20 18:14:40	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-20 18:14:57	@Espyo	which just makes it weirder
2015-12-20 18:15:53	Scruffy	it's probably a pesticide
2015-12-20 18:16:08	@Espyo	yeah, likely
2015-12-20 18:16:14	@Espyo	specially because of the cross and skullbones and all
2015-12-20 18:16:18	@Espyo	err
2015-12-20 18:16:19	Scruffy	Which could contain hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen cyanide
2015-12-20 18:16:20	@Espyo	skull and crossbones
2015-12-20 18:16:33	Scruffy	Both of which are invisible and odorless
2015-12-20 18:16:37	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-12-20 18:18:05	Scruffy	although it also might just be weed killer
2015-12-20 18:18:42	Scruffy	But that wouldn't be odorless, most are based on vinegar
2015-12-20 18:23:48	Yoshi2	Espyo: good news (or bad news), using interpreter doesn't seem to make any difference in whether the memory breakpoint is hit or not
2015-12-20 18:24:04	@Espyo	...
2015-12-20 18:25:17	Yoshi2	I guess I will need to set breakpoints everywhere and see if anything works
2015-12-20 18:25:53	@Espyo	good luck
2015-12-20 18:53:36	Yoshi2	just for lulz, I should set a memory breakpoint that goes from the first ram address to the last one
2015-12-20 18:53:42	Yoshi2	just to see that it breaks at all
2015-12-20 18:53:55	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-20 18:54:57	Yoshi2	my hopes were crushed
2015-12-20 18:55:05	@Espyo	it broke, huh
2015-12-20 18:55:06	Yoshi2	dolphin does not do that
2015-12-20 18:55:09	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-20 18:55:10	@Espyo	drat
2015-12-20 18:55:22	@Espyo	hm, I should've said "braked"
2015-12-20 18:55:47	Yoshi2	I found that it stores memory breakpoints in the game's ini file as "<from> <to> <options"
2015-12-20 18:56:01	Yoshi2	so I thought I could change that a bit, but alas, dolphin doesn't like that
2015-12-20 18:56:05	@Espyo	darn
2015-12-20 18:56:54	Yoshi2	ok, let's be more conservative and choose a smaller address range
2015-12-20 18:57:41	Yoshi2	still doesn't work, it resets the second address to the first address
2015-12-20 18:57:57	@Espyo	crud
2015-12-20 18:58:08	Yoshi2	now I wonder if this range thing works at all
2015-12-20 18:58:18	@Espyo	yeah, I bet it doesn't
2015-12-20 18:58:20	Yoshi2	it doesn't
2015-12-20 18:58:27	Yoshi2	fun times
2015-12-20 18:58:50	@Espyo	you can probably check the cheat codes that come with Pikmin 2 for simple stuff like leader health
2015-12-20 18:58:58	@Espyo	which will tell you what address the health is
2015-12-20 18:59:02	@Espyo	put a breakpoint there
2015-12-20 18:59:05	@Espyo	and lose some health mid-game
2015-12-20 18:59:11	Yoshi2	mhm
2015-12-20 18:59:21	@Espyo	...of course, it'll take you hours if you're using the interpreter...
2015-12-20 18:59:40	Yoshi2	well, I give up on the interpreter
2015-12-20 18:59:59	Yoshi2	JIT is the way to go
2015-12-20 19:00:02	@Espyo	good
2015-12-20 19:01:08	Yoshi2	time to find some pikmin 2 codes for the EU version
2015-12-20 19:01:46	@Espyo	I have a few
2015-12-20 19:01:49	@Espyo	want health?
2015-12-20 19:02:24	@Espyo	health is 02E11CE4, I think
2015-12-20 19:02:36	@Espyo	I say this because there's actually no code for health, but I had this lying around
2015-12-20 19:02:37	@Espyo	so it SHOULD work
2015-12-20 19:03:27	@Espyo	 04229CBC is the time you have left in a challenge
2015-12-20 19:03:34	@Espyo	I actually have no other good codes...
2015-12-20 19:07:28	Yoshi2	for some reason, I can't use the cheat manager
2015-12-20 19:08:10	Yoshi2	oh, I have to enable it

2015-12-20 19:51:46	Scruffy	Esypo, about your collisions issue, shouldn't the object choose which wall to slide by using which angle is farthest from its current angle, and which wall is closest at the time?
2015-12-20 19:52:10	@Espyo	that's great logic
2015-12-20 19:52:18	@Espyo	and I am using the angle farthest from its current angle
2015-12-20 19:52:25	@Espyo	but the part about the closest wall is so so tricky...
2015-12-20 19:52:30	@Espyo	although
2015-12-20 19:52:31	Scruffy	Ah, I see
2015-12-20 19:52:33	@Espyo	that might actually be it, period
2015-12-20 19:52:42	@Espyo	there might be an easy way to get the closest wall, and I'm overcomplicating it
2015-12-20 19:52:56	@Espyo	heck, when you've been gnawing at this for hours on end, it's easy to ignore the simple solutions
2015-12-20 19:53:10	@Espyo	you start to boil in your head all kinds of scenarios in which it MIGHT not work
2015-12-20 19:53:16	@Espyo	wouldn't be the first time
2015-12-20 19:53:24	@Espyo	I'll definitely keep your solution in mind though, thank you
2015-12-20 19:54:20	Scruffy	No problem
2015-12-20 19:54:49	Scruffy	I guess we've all been having computing issues today
2015-12-20 19:54:53	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-12-20 19:54:59	@Espyo	just another day
2015-12-20 19:55:18	Scruffy	I've been trying to rig a Pikmin model to a skeleton to get a posable model anyone can use in animation
2015-12-20 19:55:44	Scruffy	And I finally got all the bones to work except the eyes
2015-12-20 19:56:02	Scruffy	I almost have it, but they won't be able to change shape or pupil size yet
2015-12-20 19:56:31	Scruffy	That's better than how actual Pikmin eyes are though, they're just textures
2015-12-20 19:56:37	Scruffy	pretty lifeless
2015-12-20 19:56:51	@Espyo	heh, yeah

2015-12-20 19:59:31	Scruffy	Ugh, but for now, the eyes I've created are working except when they're part of the skeleton
2015-12-20 19:59:50	Scruffy	They're fine on their own, but once I try to move them with the body, they mess up
2015-12-20 19:59:55	Yoyo	Maybe you could find a way to have the pupils a thin separate object that snaps to the eyes.
2015-12-20 20:00:32	Yoyo	But is also molds to the shape of the eyes.
2015-12-20 20:00:43	Yoyo	it*
2015-12-20 20:01:26	Scruffy	Oh, that's true
2015-12-20 20:01:38	Scruffy	Right now the pupils are part of the eyes
2015-12-20 20:01:54	Scruffy	Yeah, that could work
2015-12-20 20:02:03	@Espyo	heh, we're all just giving each other ideas today
2015-12-20 20:02:09	Scruffy	hehe yeah
2015-12-20 20:03:13	Yoyo	And the eyes could be on a separate axis from the rest of the skeleton.
2015-12-20 20:03:32	Scruffy	I already have it that way
2015-12-20 20:03:40	Scruffy	So that they can focus on an object
2015-12-20 20:04:00	Scruffy	My problem is they still have to be part of the skeleton to move with the skeleton
2015-12-20 20:04:39	Scruffy	And when I make them part of the skeleton, the eyes are fine, but they rotate incorrectly because the objects governing their rotation are not correct
2015-12-20 20:04:44	Scruffy	I'm trying to correct them now
2015-12-20 20:06:55	Yoyo	If we sync the two eyes then we only have to do it for one eye.
2015-12-20 20:07:15	Scruffy	But then the eyes could only look in one direction
2015-12-20 20:09:36	Yoyo	Oh.

2015-12-21 01:24:45	@Espyo	since the next release won't be that important, it might be a simple enemy
2015-12-21 01:24:47	@PikFan	how many enemies do you already have?
2015-12-21 01:24:59	@Espyo	Cloaking Burrow-nit, Red Bulborb, and Dwarf Red Bulborb
2015-12-21 01:25:03	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-21 01:25:27	@Espyo	and yeah, I've had to ask before while making the engine
2015-12-21 01:25:29	@Espyo	about this or that
2015-12-21 01:25:33	@Espyo	never something big, though
2015-12-21 01:25:41	@PikFan	how long do they take to respond, usually?
2015-12-21 01:25:44	@Espyo	most of it I made it myself, or researched tips on how to do stuff
2015-12-21 01:25:50	@Espyo	honestly, not more than a day
2015-12-21 01:26:03	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-21 01:26:04	@Espyo	of course, the others might be as lost as I am
2015-12-21 01:26:09	@Espyo	plus this community has seen better days
2015-12-21 01:26:12	@Espyo	pretty slow lately
2015-12-21 01:26:16	@Espyo	oh well
2015-12-21 01:26:20	@Espyo	I'll figure out SOMETHING
2015-12-21 01:26:21	@PikFan	hopefully not
2015-12-21 01:26:23	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-21 01:26:28	@Espyo	I've had similar, huge, problems before
2015-12-21 01:26:42	@Espyo	so many months spent developing level geometry physics... *shudder*
2015-12-21 01:26:46	@Espyo	so many headaches...
2015-12-21 01:26:50	@Espyo	impossible problems...
2015-12-21 01:26:53	@Espyo	and now they're all fixed
2015-12-21 01:26:57	@Espyo	except for this collision thing
2015-12-21 01:27:19	@Espyo	no wonder everybody and their cat tells you to use an existing engine
2015-12-21 01:27:19	@PikFan	you'll pull through one way or the other
2015-12-21 01:27:22	@Espyo	creating your own is hell
2015-12-21 01:27:27	@Espyo	yeah, something will come up
2015-12-21 01:27:29	@Espyo	well, I have to go now
2015-12-21 01:27:32	@Espyo	night

2015-12-21 13:11:37	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2015-12-21 13:14:16	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-21 13:16:17	Yoshi2	Espyo: good news: I have managed to confirm that memory breaks DO work at all
2015-12-21 13:16:46	@Espyo	oh, well
2015-12-21 13:16:53	Yoshi2	but now I'm running into an issue I've heard people write about, where memory breaks aren't triggered even though the memory address is accessed
2015-12-21 13:17:47	@Espyo	so... they're NOT working, then
2015-12-21 13:17:55	Yoshi2	they are
2015-12-21 13:18:01	Yoshi2	but not always
2015-12-21 13:19:04	Yoshi2	I'll use your health code as an example for figuring out the exact conditions
2015-12-21 13:19:46	@Espyo	eeeesh
2015-12-21 13:39:53	Yoshi2	this isn't working as well as it should
2015-12-21 13:40:03	Yoshi2	I guess I will go back to the method that actually worked
2015-12-21 13:40:16	Yoshi2	which is adding code for breaking directly in the code
2015-12-21 13:41:43	@Espyo	guess so...

2015-12-21 14:04:54	Yoshi2	I am slightly terrified that I can make these kinds of modifications to the code and it actually compiles and works
2015-12-21 14:05:34	Yoshi2	well, "works" as in doesn't break
2015-12-21 14:06:31	Yoshi2	I remember there being a time when code would break when I only looked at it in a weird way
2015-12-21 14:07:42	@Espyo	for sure
2015-12-21 14:07:48	@Espyo	to the point where it's scarier if things DO work well
2015-12-21 14:08:06	@Espyo	if I write a huge bunch of sketchy code, run it, and it works fine at first
2015-12-21 14:08:10	@Espyo	then that DEFINITELY means something is wrong
2015-12-21 14:13:28	Miles	I like going "eh this part of the code worked fine when I used it 7 months ago, I'm sure it still works"
2015-12-21 14:13:35	Miles	That never causes any issues
2015-12-21 14:13:59	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-21 14:14:07	Yoshi2	for the most part, there is no reason why old code would suddenly break
2015-12-21 14:14:25	Yoshi2	unless the code relies on external dependencies and those dependencies change
2015-12-21 14:16:28	Yoshi2	my old python code usually has very little if any dependencies, and they usually work fine
2015-12-21 14:17:13	Yoshi2	*the code usually works fine
2015-12-21 14:23:10	Yoshi2	dolphin likes to crash when I look at it in a weird way though
2015-12-21 14:27:09	Yoshi2	Espyo: it seems the places where the memory check is implemented never actually hit the addresses I need
2015-12-21 14:29:55	Yoshi2	I've implemented a VERY generous check in which the address only needs to be in a 1280 byte interval for the break to be triggered
2015-12-21 14:30:04	Yoshi2	nope, never gets triggered
2015-12-21 14:42:20	@Espyo	hmmmm
2015-12-21 14:43:18	Yoshi2	this is suprisingly annoying
2015-12-21 14:49:57	Yoshi2	oh well, I hijacked the GetPointer function in Memmap.cpp which seems to work for breaking when opening up the piklopedia
2015-12-21 14:50:35	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-21 14:53:04	Yoshi2	somehow, using this method on the health address didn't work
2015-12-21 14:53:13	@Espyo	good grief
2015-12-21 14:53:21	Yoshi2	it's really odd
2015-12-21 14:53:38	Yoshi2	would probably need to ask the dolphin devs about the stuff sometime
2015-12-21 14:53:47	@Espyo	I think they have an IRC channel
2015-12-21 15:39:40	Yoshi2	it would be cool if there was a way to go back one instruction
2015-12-21 15:39:58	@Espyo	that's pretty insane
2015-12-21 15:40:07	@Espyo	but yeah, it would be
2015-12-21 15:40:10	@Espyo	actually, visual studio can do that
2015-12-21 15:41:30	Yoshi2	can visual studio do gamecube assembly though?
2015-12-21 15:42:12	Yoshi2	I'd actually be happy if dolphin logged the last few instructions
2015-12-21 15:42:17	@Espyo	heh, nope
2015-12-21 15:42:27	@Espyo	hm, I know Dolphin has some logging features somewhere
2015-12-21 15:42:50	Yoshi2	mhm, would be great if you could tell me where I can find it
2015-12-21 15:43:06	@Espyo	dunno, just know it has some
2015-12-21 15:43:12	@Espyo	might not even be for instruction logging

2015-12-22 14:10:59	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-22 14:12:58	Yoshi2	looking at the 65 mb assembler file makes me want to cry
2015-12-22 14:13:12	@Espyo	eep
2015-12-22 15:25:53	Yoshi2	I guess I will need to poke around more with dolphin
2015-12-22 15:26:54	@Espyo	heh, good luck...
2015-12-22 15:26:58	Yoshi2	maybe I can get out of this iterrupt and into some actually meaningful code

2015-12-22 23:46:01	@PikFan	hi
2015-12-22 23:46:21	@PikFan	hey, Espyo, thanks for grabbing those radar icons
2015-12-22 23:46:34	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-22 23:46:35	@Espyo	no prob
2015-12-22 23:46:57	@Espyo	I took the roll to find unused things and add them to TCRF
2015-12-22 23:47:02	@Espyo	https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Pikmin_3&action=history
2015-12-22 23:47:12	@PikFan	nice
2015-12-22 23:48:31	@PikFan	but yeah, I thought it was a bit ironic we were using the Drake's icon on all the radar related stuff except for the radar page itself
2015-12-22 23:50:16	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-22 23:50:17	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-22 23:54:01	@PikFan	I wonder when we'll get P4 info...
2015-12-22 23:54:19	@PikFan	I'm betting on a summer 2016 release
2015-12-22 23:54:49	@PikFan	we all know how much of a liar Nintendo is
2015-12-22 23:55:16	@Espyo	probably
2015-12-22 23:55:24	@PikFan	"oh, P4 is almost done, we'll have it out by the end of the year"
2015-12-22 23:56:03	@PikFan	"wait, oh, we want to add this really silly thing, so now we're releasing it next year <trollface>"
2015-12-22 23:56:32	@PikFan	besides, "almost done" could mean anything
2015-12-22 23:57:18	@PikFan	what they consider almost done is probably like 60-70% done for us
2015-12-22 23:57:33	@PikFan	that's close, but not quite
2015-12-23 00:03:27	@Espyo	yeah

2015-12-23 14:18:18	@Espyo	there it is
2015-12-23 15:04:07	Yoshi2	I asked somebody I know who does disassembly about what tools could be helpful
2015-12-23 15:04:37	@Espyo	oh, nice!
2015-12-23 15:04:55	Yoshi2	one tool he suggested does not help with gamecube disassembly and the other is IDA, which is a very expensive software
2015-12-23 15:06:29	Yoshi2	I actually used ida once before, it has a pretty nice interface for figuring out how functions are related to each other
2015-12-23 15:06:39	Yoshi2	but I think it doesn't offer that much more than dolphin
