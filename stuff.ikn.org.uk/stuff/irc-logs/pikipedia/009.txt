2014-10-04 20:21:02	@Espyo	so give me your input
2014-10-04 20:21:09	@PikFan	also help pages, infoboxes, categories
2014-10-04 20:21:13	@Espyo	the current {{Welcome}} is long and complicated

2014-10-04 20:21:19	@Espyo	how's this for a new one?
2014-10-04 20:21:20	@Espyo	Hello, {{BASEPAGENAME}}, and welcome to '''Pikipedia''', a wiki with information regarding ''Pikmin''. We thank you for registering, and would like to point you to the '''[[Pikipedia:Helping out|Helping out]]''' page. We hope we can count on you, and please enjoy your stay!

2014-10-04 20:21:24	@PikFan	those meta pages still need to be merged
2014-10-04 20:21:34	@PikFan	oh, which reminds me
2014-10-04 20:21:54	@PikFan	we still need to make a Brittany's European version of the notes
2014-10-04 20:22:39	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-04 20:22:47	@PikFan	hmm... the template doesn't seem too confusing
2014-10-04 20:23:00	@PikFan	it's more simple than Fanon's welcome template

2014-10-04 20:24:38	@PikFan	uh
2014-10-04 20:25:10	@PikFan	that seems we're thinking of new users as untrustworthy
2014-10-04 20:25:23	@PikFan	(some users are, though)
2014-10-04 20:25:35	@Espyo	it's just a standard thing to say
2014-10-04 20:25:48	@PikFan	right, but still
2014-10-04 20:26:00	@PikFan	I don't know, something about it bothers me
2014-10-04 20:26:13	@Espyo	well, any replacements?
2014-10-04 20:26:33	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-10-04 20:26:43	@PikFan	nope
2014-10-04 20:26:52	@J	oh, dinner happened, and then all the distractions
2014-10-04 20:26:55	@PikFan	now I'm intensely looking at it
2014-10-04 20:27:08	@PikFan	oh hey J
2014-10-04 20:27:35	@J	could do with a link to general help pages
2014-10-04 20:27:40	@J	(the welcome)
2014-10-04 20:28:25	@J	maybe also link directly to the chat
2014-10-04 20:29:01	@J	I don't remember what the current one really says, but it looks fine otherwise
2014-10-04 20:29:48	@Espyo	it's on the helping out page
2014-10-04 20:30:01	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Talk:Project Clean Up by Dry Paratroopa (+1124) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Talk:Project_Clean_Up&curid=9210&diff=45972&oldid=45970
2014-10-04 20:30:03	@J	could replace the 'count on you' with 'look forward to your time here' or something
2014-10-04 20:30:11	@Espyo	hmmm, all right
2014-10-04 20:30:21	@J	oh, okay
2014-10-04 20:30:32	@J	I didn't look at that page, but I assumed it was about what to do, not how to do it
2014-10-04 20:30:36	@J	from the title
2014-10-04 20:31:04	@J	oh, so you just stuck most of the welcome on there instead?
2014-10-04 20:31:05	@J	fair enough
2014-10-04 20:31:30	@Espyo	helps for the front page too
2014-10-04 20:31:48	@Espyo	the front page had help, editing tasks and chatroom/help desk/etc. all scattered around
2014-10-04 20:31:51	@Espyo	so this page really helps
2014-10-04 20:32:58	@PikFan	oh, Espyo, did you see that topic?
2014-10-04 20:33:22	@Espyo	which?
2014-10-04 20:33:33	@PikFan	the link Testyo just gave
2014-10-04 20:33:34	Testyo	like light at the Pikmin are energized for less%u time

2014-10-04 20:38:46	@PikFan	he's suggesting a system that we talked about ages ago
2014-10-04 20:39:06	@Espyo	hm
2014-10-04 20:39:10	@PikFan	that is, dividing a main subject page into smaller pages, with that main page being a disambig page
2014-10-04 20:39:14	@Espyo	the one on the site message?
2014-10-04 20:39:21	@PikFan	no no

2014-10-04 21:05:02	Yoshi2	Espyo: with very little changes, I've had much more success playing Pikmin 1's BMS files than Pikmin 2
2014-10-04 21:07:08	Yoshi2	there are only 3 or 4 files out of 17 I'm unable to play, compared to ~25 from 49
2014-10-04 21:08:35	Yoshi2	sadly, the ones that I couldn't parse yet are pikise.jam (note the "se"), sysevent.jam, demobgm.jam and forest.jam
2014-10-04 21:10:17	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-10-04 21:12:59	Yoshi2	so basically, the two files with the most promising names are not yet able to be parsed
2014-10-04 21:15:18	Yoshi2	interestingly, there is a boss2.jam and a boss3.jam, but no boss1.jam
2014-10-04 21:15:25	@Espyo	hmm, that is interesting
2014-10-04 21:17:46	Yoshi2	here is a list of all the files I retrieved from the pikiseq.arc file: http://i.imgur.com/noVGynJ.png
2014-10-04 21:18:02	Yoshi2	I added .bms to the end of the filename to mark them as BMS files
2014-10-04 21:19:57	Yoshi2	wait a minute, there is no forest.jam
2014-10-04 21:21:06	Yoshi2	ah, I meant the jungle.jam. It technically parses fine, but there is some special functionality that I am not handling correctly yet
2014-10-04 21:35:29	Yoshi2	with a few workarounds, I am now able to play the jungle theme
2014-10-04 21:36:13	Yoshi2	let's see if I can get demobgm to work too
2014-10-04 21:45:49	Yoshi2	but I'm afraid sysevent is very difficult to parse, it uses that weird 0xB1 event instead of defining tracks inside the file
2014-10-04 21:46:43	Yoshi2	I'll probably have to try to read it as if it was a single track full of data because of that
2014-10-04 21:48:38	@Espyo	awesome!
2014-10-04 21:51:29	@J	I heard the command prompt in the new Windows is going to have ctrl-c as copy
2014-10-04 21:52:04	@J	so they decided it wasn't already broken enough and reused the shortcut many things implement as quit
2014-10-04 21:52:42	@Espyo	oh
2014-10-04 21:52:44	@Espyo	amazing
2014-10-04 21:52:51	@Espyo	now I won't be able to force a close
2014-10-04 21:52:58	@Espyo	I mean, copy is great and all
2014-10-04 21:52:58	@Espyo	but
2014-10-04 21:53:24	Yoshi2	and then they go ahead and call the new windows "Windows 10" because a lot of programs check if the OS name starts with "Windows 9" for 95/98 support
2014-10-04 21:53:41	@J	http://www.osnews.com/story/27969/Why_did_Microsoft_skip_Windows_9_
2014-10-04 21:53:45	@J	oh, okay
2014-10-04 21:53:46	@Espyo	heh, that was a hoax, I think
2014-10-04 21:53:49	@J	you just said that
2014-10-04 21:53:56	@J	I only right now read that
2014-10-04 21:55:06	Yoshi2	I suppose it is just a rumour
2014-10-04 22:03:46	Yoshi2	hmm, demobgm is a very lively theme
2014-10-04 22:04:36	Yoshi2	fast paced
2014-10-04 22:16:15	Yoshi2	I've hacked something together to play that sysevent file
2014-10-04 22:17:41	Yoshi2	an option to make the main track run through the entire file by itself without creating new tracks, and an option to disable events that make the track loop around

2014-10-04 22:26:23	@Espyo	how's this sound?
2014-10-04 22:26:47	@PikFan	*so you can get started right away
2014-10-04 22:27:13	@PikFan	otherwise, fine
2014-10-04 22:27:20	Yoshi2	"We hope you look forward to your time here" sounds as if this would happen in the future
2014-10-04 22:27:57	@PikFan	well, yeah
2014-10-04 22:28:08	@PikFan	it's meant to be a positive, fun experience
2014-10-04 22:29:26	Yoshi2	maybe something like "We hope you will enjoy your time here" could fit better
2014-10-04 22:29:42	@PikFan	so I'm working on my fan fiction again
2014-10-04 22:29:50	@PikFan	I'm describing the Onion
2014-10-04 22:29:56	@PikFan	it's very futuristic
2014-10-04 22:30:03	@PikFan	and enormous
2014-10-04 22:30:45	Yoshi2	is it also powered by mysterious forces that allow it to ascend into low orbit?
2014-10-04 22:30:56	@PikFan	propulsion
2014-10-04 22:31:04	@PikFan	but hmm
2014-10-04 22:31:09	@PikFan	good point
2014-10-04 22:31:13	@PikFan	I'll go into that
2014-10-04 22:31:30	@PikFan	right now, the main character is looking for the Onion's leader's house
2014-10-04 22:31:40	@PikFan	(there are houses inside the Onion)
2014-10-04 22:32:17	@Espyo	yeah, whoops
2014-10-04 22:32:50	@PikFan	ooh, idea
2014-10-04 22:33:02	@PikFan	hey Espyo, didn't you get the Pikmin font some time ago?
2014-10-04 22:37:25	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-04 22:37:33	@Espyo	should be on GitHub
2014-10-04 22:37:44	@PikFan	hmm
2014-10-04 22:37:51	@PikFan	would it be possible to use it on the wiki?
2014-10-04 22:42:32	@Espyo	it's
2014-10-04 22:42:34	@Espyo	incredibly hideous
2014-10-04 22:43:00	@Espyo	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine/master/Game_data/Graphics/Font.png this?
2014-10-04 22:43:05	@Espyo	like, size 72 font
2014-10-04 22:43:12	@PikFan	no, never
2014-10-04 22:43:17	@PikFan	this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine/master/Game_data/Graphics/Area_name_font.png
2014-10-04 22:43:19	@Espyo	we CAN use it
2014-10-04 22:43:26	@Espyo	hmmmm, what on?
2014-10-04 22:43:39	@PikFan	maybe for like titles
2014-10-04 22:55:33	@Espyo	it'd probably look horrible
2014-10-04 22:55:46	@Espyo	but I'd have to make it usable, first
2014-10-04 22:55:53	@Espyo	as it is, it's usable by Allegro, but not windows
2014-10-04 22:56:37	@PikFan	hmmmm
2014-10-04 22:56:59	@PikFan	if it does look bad, then maybe we should stick to templates
2014-10-04 23:00:37	@Espyo	putting it on templates?
2014-10-04 23:00:41	@Espyo	probably also incredibly horrible
2014-10-04 23:00:48	@Espyo	problem is this font is ultra different from all others
2014-10-04 23:01:40	@PikFan	maybe we can test it on [[Pikipedia:Sandbox]]
2014-10-04 23:01:41	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Sandbox" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Sandbox
2014-10-04 23:06:43	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2014-10-04 23:06:48	@Espyo	but I have to make it fonteable anyway
2014-10-04 23:06:59	@PikFan	righty
2014-10-04 23:07:01	@PikFan	*right
2014-10-04 23:07:09	@Espyo	righty-o
2014-10-04 23:07:17	@PikFan	righty-o, old chap
2014-10-04 23:07:46	@Espyo	what was the thing I had before? "We hope you enjoy your stay"?

2014-10-04 23:11:58	@Espyo	right
2014-10-04 23:12:05	@Espyo	I guess "We hope you enjoy your stay" works
2014-10-04 23:15:58	Yoshi2	sysevent.jam is what you receive when you throw every BMS event in existence into the file
2014-10-04 23:17:51	@J	jam
2014-10-04 23:18:10	@Espyo	it's the game's jams
2014-10-04 23:18:30	Yoshi2	that's what they are listed as in the BARC header inside Start.dol
2014-10-04 23:18:49	Yoshi2	SMS names them .com, Pikmin 1 names them .jam
2014-10-04 23:20:11	Yoshi2	though I've been told that these names don't matter because the game uses the music pieces based on index

2014-10-04 23:21:35	@J	at work, we use a 'jam' logging level for debugging
2014-10-04 23:21:36	@J	because jam
2014-10-04 23:22:52	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-04 23:23:09	Yoshi2	yep to jam?
2014-10-04 23:23:48	@J	jaaaaaaaam
2014-10-04 23:38:50	Yoshi2	I can't believe it, this file just broke the rule for 0xB1 events
2014-10-04 23:39:16	@Espyo	hah, you can't really believe anything
2014-10-04 23:39:16	@PikFan	going outside
2014-10-04 23:39:19	@PikFan	bye
2014-10-04 23:39:25	Yoshi2	see you
2014-10-04 23:39:32	@PikFan	anything you want to say before I go?
2014-10-04 23:39:44	@Espyo	hmm, not that I remember
2014-10-04 23:39:46	@Espyo	oh, I got Smash 4
2014-10-04 23:39:56	@PikFan	mhm, you mentioned that
2014-10-04 23:39:56	Yoshi2	me too

2014-10-05 02:28:45	Cheeky-Cheep	Hey... Anyone remember me?
2014-10-05 02:28:58	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah, I know my username has a typo.
2014-10-05 02:29:07	Cheeky-Cheep	But I'm back after two years.
2014-10-05 02:29:35	Cheeky-Cheep	Hello?
2014-10-05 02:30:00	Cheeky-Cheep	I should have writen down my password. :P
2014-10-05 02:30:24	Cheeky-Cheep	Maybe I have it written down somewhere...
2014-10-05 02:30:30	Cheeky-Cheep	Hold up.
2014-10-05 02:31:28	Cheeky-Cheep	I may have it somewhere in my old Acer laptop.
2014-10-05 02:32:18	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh, where is it...
2014-10-05 02:32:26	@PikFan	!
2014-10-05 02:32:27	@PikFan	!!!
2014-10-05 02:32:33	@PikFan	YO CHEEP!
2014-10-05 02:32:38	@PikFan	WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
2014-10-05 02:33:00	Cheeky-Cheep	I'VE BEEN GONE, MAN
2014-10-05 02:33:14	@PikFan	it's been far too long
2014-10-05 02:33:19	Cheeky-Cheep	Can't find my password.
2014-10-05 02:33:23	@PikFan	after all these years
2014-10-05 02:33:29	@PikFan	oh, that sucks
2014-10-05 02:33:29	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah, it has been way too long.
2014-10-05 02:33:41	@PikFan	I'm in high school now
2014-10-05 02:33:43	Cheeky-Cheep	But I'm back, that's all that matters. :)
2014-10-05 02:33:55	@PikFan	how long do you plan on staying?
2014-10-05 02:34:01	Cheeky-Cheep	Heh, I'm still in middle school.
2014-10-05 02:34:12	@PikFan	heh, I see
2014-10-05 02:34:13	Cheeky-Cheep	I'm staying as long as I can, actually.
2014-10-05 02:34:18	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-10-05 02:34:24	@PikFan	lots has happened
2014-10-05 02:34:25	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah.
2014-10-05 02:34:31	Cheeky-Cheep	I could tell.
2014-10-05 02:34:33	@PikFan	most notably, Pikipedia and Pikmin Wiki are merging
2014-10-05 02:34:44	@PikFan	some other stuff, too
2014-10-05 02:34:47	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh yeah, I saw the announcement.
2014-10-05 02:34:52	@PikFan	ah
2014-10-05 02:35:04	Cheeky-Cheep	I've been really busy on Twitter, so... XD
2014-10-05 02:35:08	@PikFan	but dang man
2014-10-05 02:35:14	@PikFan	you've been gone for so long
2014-10-05 02:35:29	@PikFan	you were part of the original gang
2014-10-05 02:35:47	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah, I looked up my profile. 1012 SINCE LAST EDIT
2014-10-05 02:36:00	Cheeky-Cheep	But yeah, being part of the gang was fun.
2014-10-05 02:36:04	@PikFan	yeah
2014-10-05 02:36:06	@PikFan	good times
2014-10-05 02:36:24	@PikFan	do you have Pikmin 3?
2014-10-05 02:36:28	Cheeky-Cheep	Good times.
2014-10-05 02:36:45	Cheeky-Cheep	My mom used to. I was kind of iffy about it.
2014-10-05 02:36:50	@PikFan	yeah
2014-10-05 02:37:02	@PikFan	I thought it was good, but there were a ton of little things
2014-10-05 02:37:14	@PikFan	like, Blue Pikmin can't rescue drowning Pikmin? wtf
2014-10-05 02:37:31	Cheeky-Cheep	I didn't really like the whole 'collect fruit or die' idea.
2014-10-05 02:37:32	@PikFan	also, Purple Pikmin can't stun >_>
2014-10-05 02:37:37	@PikFan	hmm
2014-10-05 02:37:38	Cheeky-Cheep	>_>
2014-10-05 02:37:50	@PikFan	I thought it was alright
2014-10-05 02:37:53	Cheeky-Cheep	<_<
2014-10-05 02:38:02	@PikFan	there was a pattern I noticed
2014-10-05 02:38:09	Cheeky-Cheep	What was it?
2014-10-05 02:38:22	@PikFan	like in Pikmin 1, the problem was centered around 1 person
2014-10-05 02:38:33	@PikFan	then in Pikmin 2, the problem was centered around a company
2014-10-05 02:38:40	Cheeky-Cheep	Wait a sec. I think I know what you're talking about.
2014-10-05 02:38:44	@PikFan	and in Pikmin 3, it was centered around a whole planet
2014-10-05 02:38:55	Cheeky-Cheep	I NOTICED THAT TOO :0
2014-10-05 02:39:00	@PikFan	wow
2014-10-05 02:39:15	@PikFan	but yeah, with each game, each situation is worse than the last
2014-10-05 02:39:16	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah. I'm smart! :D
2014-10-05 02:39:24	Cheeky-Cheep	Agreed.
2014-10-05 02:39:53	@PikFan	18:34	Cheeky-Cheep	I'm staying as long as I can, actually.
2014-10-05 02:39:59	@PikFan	so like
2014-10-05 02:40:10	@PikFan	do you plan to be here for a few weeks, or...?
2014-10-05 02:40:16	@PikFan	like, what are your long-term plans
2014-10-05 02:40:21	Cheeky-Cheep	I think I might.
2014-10-05 02:40:27	@PikFan	ah, good
2014-10-05 02:40:35	@PikFan	it's just that
2014-10-05 02:40:39	@PikFan	I'm worried
2014-10-05 02:40:41	Cheeky-Cheep	I've been busy with school and all that, but I'll find time to be on here.
2014-10-05 02:40:47	@PikFan	I see
2014-10-05 02:41:02	@PikFan	I'm worried because users say that they're back, but then disappear again for a while
2014-10-05 02:41:10	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah. Gotta stick with the gang! :)
2014-10-05 02:41:14	@PikFan	right
2014-10-05 02:41:25	@PikFan	I'll tell you right now
2014-10-05 02:41:38	Cheeky-Cheep	But once I find my password, I'll be up and running again. No worries!
2014-10-05 02:41:42	@PikFan	I might not be on during the weekdays, but I'll definitely be on during the weekend
2014-10-05 02:41:49	Cheeky-Cheep	Nice!
2014-10-05 02:42:09	@PikFan	also, depending on how early you get on, you might get a chance to see Espyo
2014-10-05 02:42:15	@PikFan	you remember Espyo, right?
2014-10-05 02:42:26	Cheeky-Cheep	I don't think I do...
2014-10-05 02:42:30	@PikFan	mm
2014-10-05 02:42:37	Cheeky-Cheep	But I rmember Peanut, that's for sure. XD
2014-10-05 02:42:42	@PikFan	well, he's a very active editor on Pikipedia
2014-10-05 02:42:48	@PikFan	yeah, I haven't heard from him
2014-10-05 02:42:56	@PikFan	last time I talked to him was last summer
2014-10-05 02:42:58	Cheeky-Cheep	Hm.

2014-10-05 02:44:01	@PikFan	I don't have a tablet xP

2014-10-05 02:45:24	@PikFan	we're all growing up
2014-10-05 02:45:32	Cheeky-Cheep	I may have left it at my grandma's not sure.
2014-10-05 02:45:34	@PikFan	wait, did I say I'm in middle school
2014-10-05 02:45:40	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh yeah. Time flies!
2014-10-05 02:45:40	@PikFan	I meant HIGH school, sorry
2014-10-05 02:45:56	Cheeky-Cheep	It's cool.
2014-10-05 02:45:59	@PikFan	I'm in 9th grade
2014-10-05 02:46:17	@PikFan	we met when I was in... uh

2014-10-05 02:46:21	@PikFan	6th grade, was it?
2014-10-05 02:46:26	@PikFan	I see
2014-10-05 02:46:28	Cheeky-Cheep	I believe so.
2014-10-05 02:46:31	@PikFan	how's 8th grade going?
2014-10-05 02:46:46	Cheeky-Cheep	Pretty good. How's 9th grade?
2014-10-05 02:46:51	@PikFan	fun
2014-10-05 02:46:55	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah.
2014-10-05 02:46:58	@PikFan	it's pretty easy
2014-10-05 02:47:09	@PikFan	also there's a lot more freedom
2014-10-05 02:47:19	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh yeah.
2014-10-05 02:47:22	@PikFan	the most I get is 3 subjects a night
2014-10-05 02:47:35	Cheeky-Cheep	Love my new school. Everyone's nice to me for once.
2014-10-05 02:47:35	@PikFan	our day is divided into 5 periods
2014-10-05 02:47:41	@PikFan	great!
2014-10-05 02:47:52	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh yeah. Really nice! :D
2014-10-05 02:48:03	@PikFan	my schedule is science, study hall, math, Japanese, and computers
2014-10-05 02:48:17	@PikFan	I do homework in study hall, and I don't get homework in computers
2014-10-05 02:48:33	@PikFan	I typically get math and Japanese homework, and occasionally science
2014-10-05 02:48:45	@PikFan	but it's fine
2014-10-05 02:48:49	@PikFan	the homework is alright
2014-10-05 02:48:58	@PikFan	I'm doing much better than last year
2014-10-05 02:49:05	@PikFan	A's in all of my classes
2014-10-05 02:49:27	Cheeky-Cheep	I have ACE, Social Studies, STEM, Physical Ed., Language arts, Biology, and Pre-Algebra as classes.
2014-10-05 02:49:57	Cheeky-Cheep	I have reading and podcasting as my ACE classes.
2014-10-05 02:50:08	@PikFan	so you have 7 periods?
2014-10-05 02:50:21	Cheeky-Cheep	And STEM is a carpentry class, basically.
2014-10-05 02:50:28	@PikFan	mm
2014-10-05 02:50:32	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah. Busy days.
2014-10-05 02:50:34	@PikFan	how long is your day?
2014-10-05 02:50:38	@PikFan	I can imagine
2014-10-05 02:50:59	Cheeky-Cheep	From 7:00 AM to 2:30 PM. Not bad at all.
2014-10-05 02:51:16	@PikFan	hmmm
2014-10-05 02:51:29	@PikFan	8:30 AM to 3:25 PM
2014-10-05 02:51:41	Cheeky-Cheep	Only thing is that I have to wake up at 6:00 AM. >_<
2014-10-05 02:51:46	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-10-05 02:51:58	@PikFan	I have to wake up at 7
2014-10-05 02:51:59	Cheeky-Cheep	You're schedule isn't that bad.
2014-10-05 02:52:17	@PikFan	yep
2014-10-05 02:52:21	@PikFan	I feel bad for you
2014-10-05 02:52:22	Cheeky-Cheep	Well, for going and leaving school.
2014-10-05 02:52:40	@PikFan	maybe when you go to high school your schedule will get better
2014-10-05 02:52:42	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah. That's the only bad thing. X3
2014-10-05 02:53:01	Cheeky-Cheep	I'd hope so. Besides, that's after I graduate.
2014-10-05 02:53:02	@PikFan	your classes will probably be longer, but you'll have fewer of them
2014-10-05 02:53:09	@PikFan	which means less homework
2014-10-05 02:53:17	Cheeky-Cheep	You get the new Smash Brothers yet?
2014-10-05 02:53:20	@PikFan	nope
2014-10-05 02:53:29	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh. I got it tonight.
2014-10-05 02:53:31	@PikFan	I'll probably get the Wii U version
2014-10-05 02:53:33	@PikFan	ah, nice
2014-10-05 02:53:40	@PikFan	my 3DS is broken :x
2014-10-05 02:53:45	Cheeky-Cheep	I got the 3DS version. Not bad.
2014-10-05 02:53:56	@PikFan	somebody said that the graphics suck
2014-10-05 02:54:01	Cheeky-Cheep	BROKEN?! Aw man, that sucks. XD
2014-10-05 02:54:06	@PikFan	I know
2014-10-05 02:54:14	@PikFan	it really does suck
2014-10-05 02:54:29	Cheeky-Cheep	Graphics are pretty good, I think.
2014-10-05 02:54:29	@PikFan	I just wanna play Animal Crossing, dang it >:(
2014-10-05 02:54:47	@PikFan	mm
2014-10-05 02:54:48	Cheeky-Cheep	Not Portal-quality graphics, but they are good.
2014-10-05 02:54:54	@PikFan	heh, of course
2014-10-05 02:55:04	Cheeky-Cheep	You ever play Portal?
2014-10-05 02:55:07	@PikFan	no
2014-10-05 02:55:12	@PikFan	I've heard of it, though
2014-10-05 02:55:31	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh, it's disorienting at first, but oh-so fun.
2014-10-05 02:55:53	@PikFan	it has to do with making portals, yeah?
2014-10-05 02:56:03	Cheeky-Cheep	I got the Orange Box on my Xbox not long ago. Beat Portal about two weeks after I got the Orange Box.
2014-10-05 02:56:08	Cheeky-Cheep	Yeah.
2014-10-05 02:56:30	@PikFan	ah, okay
2014-10-05 02:56:36	Cheeky-Cheep	Heh. I remember Miles.
2014-10-05 02:57:02	Cheeky-Cheep	You know, the guy in the chat.
2014-10-05 02:57:24	Cheeky-Cheep	Nevermind. XD
2014-10-05 02:57:44	Cheeky-Cheep	But anyways, Portal is really fun. I suggest trying it sometime. :)
2014-10-05 02:58:45	@PikFan	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLUU3O4zW8
2014-10-05 02:59:39	Cheeky-Cheep	Oh my god, I remeber that. XD
2014-10-05 02:59:50	Cheeky-Cheep	So funny. So funny.
2014-10-05 02:59:55	@PikFan	lol
2014-10-05 03:00:01	@PikFan	ok so
2014-10-05 03:00:06	@PikFan	I'll be gone for a bit
2014-10-05 03:00:10	Cheeky-Cheep	That's from the second one, too. :3
2014-10-05 03:00:12	@PikFan	'bout an hour and a half

2014-10-05 03:00:30	Cheeky-Cheep	Pretty sure I will be. :)
2014-10-05 03:00:33	@PikFan	okay
2014-10-05 03:00:37	@PikFan	back in a bit, then
2014-10-05 03:00:49	Cheeky-Cheep	See ya!
2014-10-05 03:06:12	Cheeky-Cheep	Well, if I can't find it, it has to be at my grandmother's house. Good thing I'm going there tomorrow.
2014-10-05 03:06:37	Cheeky-Cheep	And don't worry, she has wifi at her house.
2014-10-05 03:08:59	Cheeky-Cheep	And if I do manage to find my password, well…
2014-10-05 03:12:00	Cheeky-Cheep	OH GOD
2014-10-05 03:12:12	Cheeky-Cheep	I THOUGHT HE TYPED HALF AND HOUR
2014-10-05 03:12:17	Cheeky-Cheep	AN HOUR
2014-10-05 03:13:05	Cheeky-Cheep	Ooh… I wanna get off sometime before eleven so I can have some time to myself.
2014-10-05 03:15:14	Cheeky-Cheep	Um…
2014-10-05 03:15:47	Cheeky-Cheep	I think… I think I'll get off until tomorrow, when I get to my grandmother's house.
2014-10-05 03:16:09	Cheeky-Cheep	If (or when) I find my password, I'll log into here.
2014-10-05 03:16:30	Cheeky-Cheep	Hopefully I typed/wrote my password somewhere.
2014-10-05 03:17:12	Cheeky-Cheep	Well, goodnight to you all. If I log in, I will make some changes to my user page, and other pages (obviously).
2014-10-05 03:17:32	Cheeky-Cheep	Until my return, I bid you all a pleasant goodnight.

2014-10-05 10:00:31	Yoshi2	J: I need to learn to get up early
2014-10-05 10:01:13	Yoshi2	being late in the first week at the university would be horrible
2014-10-05 10:01:24	@J	oh, you haven't started yet?
2014-10-05 10:01:38	Yoshi2	nope
2014-10-05 10:01:47	Yoshi2	tomorrow is the first day
2014-10-05 10:02:06	@J	ah, yeah, I guess October is about when they start
2014-10-05 10:02:16	@J	well, lots of people are late in the first week
2014-10-05 10:02:20	@J	...and all through the year
2014-10-05 10:02:41	@J	what are you studying?
2014-10-05 10:03:40	Yoshi2	computer science
2014-10-05 10:03:57	@J	okay, no surprise there
2014-10-05 10:04:11	Yoshi2	heh, how so?
2014-10-05 10:04:28	@J	you do programming, simple as that
2014-10-05 10:04:44	Yoshi2	fair enough
2014-10-05 10:05:53	@J	I learned from the computer science students I knew that you have exams where you write code, by hand, without a computer
2014-10-05 10:06:03	@J	that always seemed strange

2014-10-05 11:55:24	@Espyo	hey
2014-10-05 11:55:53	Yoshi2	I've looked at demobgm again because the part of it I managed to play so far was too short
2014-10-05 11:56:17	Yoshi2	demobgm actually defines several music pieces in the same file
2014-10-05 11:56:23	@Espyo	oh wow...
2014-10-05 11:56:31	@Espyo	never heard anything like that before
2014-10-05 11:56:43	@Espyo	well, archives do that
2014-10-05 11:56:50	@Espyo	but this doesn't sound like the regular archive, does it
2014-10-05 11:56:58	Yoshi2	this isn't an archive
2014-10-05 11:57:01	Yoshi2	this is a BMS file
2014-10-05 11:57:06	@Espyo	exactly
2014-10-05 11:57:12	@Espyo	so it's a bit weird
2014-10-05 11:57:17	@Espyo	what other mysteries do BMS files have?
2014-10-05 11:57:26	Yoshi2	... HOW DID I MANAGE TO MISS THIS
2014-10-05 11:57:37	Yoshi2	demobgm actually contains some text file using the 0xFB event
2014-10-05 11:57:46	Yoshi2	ehm
2014-10-05 11:57:49	Yoshi2	some text
2014-10-05 11:58:05	Yoshi2	MML:DEMO Seq.BGM Request %r\n
2014-10-05 11:58:15	Yoshi2	MML:DEMO Seq.BGM Start %r\n
2014-10-05 11:58:24	@Espyo	what?!
2014-10-05 11:58:51	@Espyo	printf things...
2014-10-05 11:59:40	Yoshi2	if you want to see it for yourself, get a hex editor and check out pikiseq.arc at offset 0x22CA0, that's the start of the demobgm file
2014-10-05 12:01:05	@Espyo	will do
2014-10-05 12:01:10	@Espyo	in a few minutes
2014-10-05 12:01:37	Yoshi2	hm, maybe the japanese version contains more unused music files
2014-10-05 12:02:37	Yoshi2	so much stuff to look at, but so little time
2014-10-05 12:02:58	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-10-05 12:09:37	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2014-10-05 12:09:42	@Espyo	nothing's there
2014-10-05 12:10:25	Yoshi2	it should be very close to that offset value
2014-10-05 12:10:50	@Espyo	oh boy
2014-10-05 12:10:50	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-05 12:10:55	@Espyo	the US version's file is different
2014-10-05 12:11:00	Yoshi2	oooo, interesting
2014-10-05 12:11:03	@Espyo	the plot thickens!
2014-10-05 12:11:13	@Espyo	makes me wonder all sorts of things
2014-10-05 12:11:19	@Espyo	because the US version doesn't have that
2014-10-05 12:11:28	Yoshi2	it has no MML in the file at all?
2014-10-05 12:11:38	@Espyo	did they find a problem after the US release, and wanted to add that to the BMS to help debug in the EU release?
2014-10-05 12:11:44	@Espyo	nope
2014-10-05 12:11:49	@Espyo	nor any other English strings
2014-10-05 12:11:52	@Espyo	at least, not nearby
2014-10-05 12:11:55	@Espyo	so it could've shifted somewhere else
2014-10-05 12:12:04	@Espyo	let me try good old ctrl+f
2014-10-05 12:12:07	Yoshi2	do that
2014-10-05 12:12:30	@Espyo	wait...
2014-10-05 12:12:32	@Espyo	it's right there
2014-10-05 12:12:35	@Espyo	then how did I miss it?
2014-10-05 12:12:48	@Espyo	hm, the files aren't identical, though
2014-10-05 12:13:00	Yoshi2	different offsets?
2014-10-05 12:13:22	@Espyo	the MML is present in exactly the same location for both
2014-10-05 12:13:32	@Espyo	but either way, the files are different
2014-10-05 12:13:35	Yoshi2	try searching for BARC in the Start.dol and see if the file list is the same
2014-10-05 12:13:40	@Espyo	what could they possibly need to change...?
2014-10-05 12:13:45	@Espyo	will do
2014-10-05 12:14:37	@Espyo	uh, the name doesn't matter, does it?
2014-10-05 12:14:41	@Espyo	there's just one .dol file
2014-10-05 12:14:46	@Espyo	 3041 KB
2014-10-05 12:15:01	Yoshi2	yeah, that one
2014-10-05 12:15:13	@Espyo	okay
2014-10-05 12:15:31	Yoshi2	what is it named?
2014-10-05 12:16:12	@Espyo	boot.dol
2014-10-05 12:16:19	@Espyo	well, the files are different, right off the bat
2014-10-05 12:16:51	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-10-05 12:16:54	@Espyo	at 22601E two bytes change
2014-10-05 12:17:25	@Espyo	and then a few more bytes change some more positions ahead, still in the middle of the list
2014-10-05 12:17:30	@Espyo	but the actual names in the list are all the same
2014-10-05 12:17:40	@Espyo	brb
2014-10-05 12:22:42	@Espyo	back
2014-10-05 12:22:56	Yoshi2	wb
2014-10-05 12:25:20	@Espyo	thanks
2014-10-05 12:26:19	Yoshi2	by now I have added so many options which are only useful for parsing that 1% of BMS tracks that seems to be malformed
2014-10-05 12:26:54	Yoshi2	start at a specific offset, enable single track mode (don't exit on End of Track), don't jump, only main track can end the music
2014-10-05 12:28:38	Yoshi2	those will be some nice options for the command line interface

2014-10-05 12:33:12	@Espyo	it's gonna be quite complex when it's over
2014-10-05 12:34:04	Yoshi2	it is already very complex
2014-10-05 12:34:18	@Espyo	well, more
2014-10-05 12:34:22	@Espyo	loads more
2014-10-05 12:35:59	Yoshi2	I have ~4 different files for parsing SMS, Pikmin 1, Pikmin 2, Wind Waker
2014-10-05 12:36:13	Yoshi2	I still need to clean them up because not every event is the same in each
2014-10-05 12:36:37	@Espyo	right
2014-10-05 12:37:11	Yoshi2	there is also the option to completely rewrite the message parsing because right now it is a big chain of If-Elif-Else
2014-10-05 12:38:22	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-05 12:43:23	Yoshi2	added another option that makes the track end only if all tracks have ended
2014-10-05 12:44:09	@Espyo	hm, yeah, that's a good idea
2014-10-05 12:44:57	Yoshi2	this goes against the BMS specifications I have here, but oh well
2014-10-05 12:45:25	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-05 12:45:44	Yoshi2	this entire file goes against the BMS specifications, so I think I'll be fine
2014-10-05 12:47:39	Yoshi2	aaand this was the last track in this file
2014-10-05 12:48:03	Yoshi2	I count 8 music files o.o
2014-10-05 12:48:32	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2014-10-05 12:48:56	Yoshi2	to dump them as midi files, I'd have to add all the updates I added to my live player to the midi converter
2014-10-05 12:49:09	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-05 12:49:13	@Espyo	that's gonna be a lot of work...
2014-10-05 12:49:36	Yoshi2	probably a solid one or two hours for adding+testing
2014-10-05 12:51:11	Yoshi2	I have not yet played Pikmin 1, but I am fairly positive that this music is unused
2014-10-05 12:51:12	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-05 12:51:31	Yoshi2	very fast paced, completely unlike Pikmin
2014-10-05 12:51:51	Yoshi2	I'll write that down on the discussion page for Pikmin 1 on TCRF

2014-10-05 12:52:13	@Espyo	I mean, that text IS used for debugging
2014-10-05 12:52:17	@Espyo	and for the most part, TCRF covers that

2014-10-05 16:51:32	@J	but I think it's got out of hand
2014-10-05 16:51:57	@J	all I've done is define the interfaces, with brief comments (not full documentation), and I'm up to 500 lines
2014-10-05 16:52:21	@J	as in, every function does nothing write now
2014-10-05 17:17:12	@J	*right
2014-10-05 17:17:14	@J	what
2014-10-05 17:17:19	@J	I'm so sorry
2014-10-05 17:18:01	@Espyo	happens
2014-10-05 17:18:06	@Espyo	hmmmmm... less bloat, more action
2014-10-05 17:18:22	@Espyo	though now that you have all the bloat out of the way, the only thing left is the action
2014-10-05 17:57:00	@J	I also feel like I need a new name for the rewrite - I called it fsmanage before
2014-10-05 17:57:17	@J	it basically provides generic stuff for managing filesystems of any kind
2014-10-05 17:57:30	@J	plus user interfaces on top of that
2014-10-05 17:58:40	@Espyo	well, it's self-explanatory

2014-10-05 18:52:01	Testyo	we don't like having few people on day 11 (Pikmin 1 at least)
2014-10-05 18:52:11	@Espyo	I manually disconnected him
2014-10-05 18:52:20	@Espyo	he already ping timeout'd another network
2014-10-05 18:52:25	@Espyo	and instead of restarting that network
2014-10-05 18:52:29	@Espyo	it's easier to blow it all and reboot him

2014-10-05 18:55:51	@Espyo	hm, I think I found an oversight
2014-10-05 18:56:03	@Espyo	on the KopPad, you get the map of the whole area
2014-10-05 18:56:06	@Espyo	but there's fog of war
2014-10-05 18:56:15	@Espyo	only the parts you visited actually show up, the rest is not drawn
2014-10-05 18:56:32	@Espyo	if you explore some new parts and end the day
2014-10-05 18:56:35	@Espyo	and save
2014-10-05 18:56:38	@Espyo	and then return to a previous day
2014-10-05 18:56:47	@Espyo	the parts will still be available on the map
2014-10-05 18:57:05	@Espyo	but if you explore the parts, and try redoing the day, they'll be unknown again
2014-10-05 19:01:22	@Espyo	yyyyyyyep
2014-10-05 19:01:28	@Espyo	let me try a hard reset
2014-10-05 19:03:44	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-10-05 19:03:57	@Espyo	actually, after a hard reset, you still get the newly-covered map
2014-10-05 19:04:07	@Espyo	so I guess that in previous days, you can see what's uncovered in the current day
2014-10-05 19:04:52	@Espyo	yep, it's intended
2014-10-05 19:05:05	@Espyo	makes sense, saving the parts of the map that are discovered for every day on the save file...
2014-10-05 19:05:09	@Espyo	that'd get pretty heavy pretty fast
2014-10-05 19:09:54	@J	I'd say it does make more sense for the player that way, in the context of a save file's 'narrative', if that makes sense
2014-10-05 19:10:04	@J	I can't see it really taking up that much space, though
2014-10-05 19:10:33	@J	it doesn't need to be hugely accurate
2014-10-05 19:10:45	@J	just a fairly low-resolution grid of booleans
2014-10-05 19:17:05	@Espyo	yeah, agreed
2014-10-05 19:17:12	@Espyo	but the way they did it isn't very low-resolution

2014-10-05 19:25:25	Yoshi2	this consumed more time than I expected
2014-10-05 19:26:12	Yoshi2	I shouldn't go there on a sunday ever again
2014-10-05 19:28:21	Yoshi2	the bus I planned to take in that town is only available from monday to saturday, and all other buses didn't go as often as normally, had to walk all the way on feet
2014-10-05 19:28:52	Yoshi2	but at least I have a rough idea of how to get to where I need to go tomorrow

2014-10-05 19:55:48	Yoshi2	it was worth it, sort of
2014-10-05 19:55:53	Yoshi2	but I paid a very high price
2014-10-05 19:56:12	Yoshi2	hopefully I will still be able to walk tomorrow
2014-10-05 19:57:12	Yoshi2	it was cold, it was rainy
2014-10-05 19:57:18	Yoshi2	I hate this weather

2014-10-05 20:04:19	@J	those look quite nice
2014-10-05 20:04:26	@J	also, that comparison at the bottm

2014-10-05 20:05:00	@J	how far is it?
2014-10-05 20:12:47	Yoshi2	30 minutes by walking
2014-10-05 20:13:53	@Espyo	J: I fail to see what the purpose is
2014-10-05 20:20:54	@J	it's just a thing they tried
2014-10-05 20:20:58	@J	Daala is a video codec
2014-10-05 20:21:45	@J	okay, that's not really too far, then
2014-10-05 20:22:05	@J	I used to walk to university sometimes, took about 45 minutes, and I walk quite fast
2014-10-05 20:22:13	@J	but the rain makes all the difference
2014-10-05 20:22:17	Yoshi2	and the cold
2014-10-05 20:22:25	Yoshi2	and the fact that I could just take the bus
2014-10-05 20:28:32	Yoshi2	TCRF does not support uploading midi :(
2014-10-05 20:28:43	Yoshi2	I guess I'll have to convert them
2014-10-05 20:33:34	Yoshi2	I just noticed a huge mistake in my code, I am not turning off notes correctly
2014-10-05 20:37:49	Yoshi2	... this could actually be the cause of the timing problems
2014-10-05 20:39:13	Yoshi2	nevermind
2014-10-05 20:40:07	@Espyo	hmm, I can ask them to allow MIDI
2014-10-05 20:41:29	@Espyo	you won't need any special soundfont for this, will you?
2014-10-05 20:41:58	@Espyo	what exactly are you uploading, anyway?
2014-10-05 20:42:13	@Espyo	unused tracks, songs, or just a complement to BMS documentation?

2014-10-05 20:47:24	@Espyo	*oh
2014-10-05 20:47:47	Yoshi2	well, there is probably some point in not allowing midi, it would probably sound different on each PC
2014-10-05 20:48:24	@Espyo	yeah, but as long as you get to hear the music
2014-10-05 20:49:13	Yoshi2	on the other hand, midi would be very small compared to the ogg file

2014-10-05 22:00:56	@Espyo	that's the "ship upgraded" theme from Pikmin 1
2014-10-05 22:03:08	Yoshi2	number four?
2014-10-05 22:04:36	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-05 22:05:35	@Espyo	wait
2014-10-05 22:05:40	@Espyo	are all of these tracks for the same song?

2014-10-05 22:07:49	Yoshi2	ah, you are talking about the midi file I gave you?
2014-10-05 22:08:22	Yoshi2	they are for the same piece
2014-10-05 22:09:17	@Espyo	ah
2014-10-05 22:09:21	@Espyo	any way to combine them?
2014-10-05 22:09:24	@Espyo	wait, I've got a way
2014-10-05 22:09:33	@Espyo	but if they're all the same piece, the 4th track is a dead giveaway
2014-10-05 22:09:38	@Espyo	this is the theme from Pikmin 1
2014-10-05 22:10:01	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-10-05 22:11:18	Yoshi2	there is a second music piece that starts of similar to that, but is a bit longer

2014-10-05 22:13:13	Yoshi2	this one actually loops around, so the file ended up being a bit longer because I can't determine when to stop
2014-10-05 22:15:02	Yoshi2	after 20 seconds nothing new will come, as far as I can tell
2014-10-05 22:15:54	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-05 22:16:30	@Espyo	hmm, it's playing as several different midis to me
2014-10-05 22:16:34	@Espyo	let me try not foobar
2014-10-05 22:16:59	Yoshi2	odd
2014-10-05 22:17:14	@Espyo	Winamp gives me a 18 minute thing
2014-10-05 22:17:21	@Espyo	supposedly all tracks one after the other
2014-10-05 22:17:34	Yoshi2	that probably shouldn't happen, I'll try something
2014-10-05 22:18:04	Yoshi2	I set the midi version to 2 when I encountered some errors, but that was pointless
2014-10-05 22:18:07	Yoshi2	I'll set it back to 1
2014-10-05 22:19:21	Yoshi2	Espyo: try this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zntg0g86hgxylmq/demobgm_music%237.midi?dl=0

2014-10-05 22:21:18	@Espyo	ah, there we go
2014-10-05 22:21:35	@Espyo	I think the full song's still from Pikmin 1
2014-10-05 22:21:51	@Espyo	the cutscene is short, but I think every time it happens, you get Olimar monologuing about how he can now explore a different area
2014-10-05 22:21:58	@Espyo	and until you press A, you can continue hearing music
2014-10-05 22:22:00	@Espyo	I think
2014-10-05 22:23:09	Yoshi2	interesting, so the music might not actually be unused
2014-10-05 22:24:09	Yoshi2	that'll be something to confirm next week, I'll take a nap now
2014-10-05 22:24:11	Yoshi2	good night

2014-10-05 22:24:16	@Espyo	oh, it is unused
2014-10-05 22:24:20	@Espyo	wait
2014-10-05 22:24:23	@Espyo	is this from P1 or P2?
2014-10-05 22:25:12	Yoshi2	Pikmin 1
2014-10-05 22:26:54	@Espyo	oh
2014-10-05 22:26:56	@Espyo	then it's used
2014-10-05 22:27:09	Yoshi2	my dreams, crushed :(
2014-10-05 22:28:01	Yoshi2	I guess I can dump the other pieces and see if those are used too, and then I'll have to correct my text on the talk page

2014-10-06 03:16:35	Cheepy-Cheepy	...
2014-10-06 03:16:45	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well, I've settled in once again.
2014-10-06 03:16:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	But...
2014-10-06 03:17:01	Cheepy-Cheepy	Something is bothering me here.
2014-10-06 03:17:24	Cheepy-Cheepy	There wasn't been much activity on the 'recent changes' tab.
2014-10-06 03:17:35	Cheepy-Cheepy	Quite frankly, I'm saddened by that.
2014-10-06 03:17:47	Cheepy-Cheepy	I honestly do not want this website to die.
2014-10-06 03:18:11	Cheepy-Cheepy	I really do not.
2014-10-06 03:18:42	Cheepy-Cheepy	But it seems like I returned to see this website just rot on its deathbed.
2014-10-06 03:19:32	Cheepy-Cheepy	And that's definitely NOT something I EVER wanted to return to here.
2014-10-06 03:20:03	Cheepy-Cheepy	But then again, my buddies on here will start noticing me again.
2014-10-06 03:20:17	Cheepy-Cheepy	But it's not the same…
2014-10-06 03:20:40	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'll be sure to stay and enjoy this website for as long as it's still around.
2014-10-06 03:20:50	Cheepy-Cheepy	Now enough with the spamming.
2014-10-06 03:21:10	Cheepy-Cheepy	I… I gotta go, fellas. Goodnight.

2014-10-06 20:02:39	@J	some guy called Cheepy-Cheepy was here around 3am talking to no-one about low activity
2014-10-06 20:02:42	@J	presumably on fanon
2014-10-06 20:07:30	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-06 20:07:34	@Espyo	I think he's a fanoner, yes
2014-10-06 20:07:37	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-10-06 20:07:48	@Espyo	I think I remember removing a categorization on a... infobox leader template, was it?
2014-10-06 20:07:50	@Espyo	on Pikipedia
2014-10-06 20:07:54	@Espyo	so maybe he's a Pikipedian too

2014-10-06 20:16:30	@J	...eh, close enough
2014-10-06 20:17:11	Yoshi2	good day
2014-10-06 20:18:03	@Espyo	heuyf, Yoshi2
2014-10-06 20:18:05	@Espyo	so, how was it?
2014-10-06 20:18:50	Yoshi2	it was alright, but I'm tired of walking around all over the place
2014-10-06 20:20:10	Yoshi2	the people are nice enough, but my time table next week is horrible
2014-10-06 20:20:20	@Espyo	time tables usually are
2014-10-06 20:20:32	@Espyo	and the free time... off
2014-10-06 20:20:34	@Espyo	*oof
2014-10-06 20:21:31	Yoshi2	one lesson in the morning
2014-10-06 20:22:05	Yoshi2	and then another in the afternoon/evening, so I'm stuck at the place the entire day
2014-10-06 20:23:43	@Espyo	augh
2014-10-06 20:23:45	Miles	1.4 made falling out of bounds do damage, as there was a Mission Mode DLC map that had bottomless pits (not caring that it was already normally possible to fall out in multiplayer...)
2014-10-06 20:24:09	Miles	Which made respawning act differently for some reason and rendered a few tricks impossible
2014-10-06 20:24:25	Miles	2.0 is the one where they went out of the way to "fix" stuff because screw Nintendo
2014-10-06 20:24:31	Miles	I don't know what all they changed
2014-10-06 20:25:23	Yoshi2	Miles: in Pikmin 3?
2014-10-06 20:25:28	Miles	Yes
2014-10-06 20:25:37	Yoshi2	I see
2014-10-06 20:26:41	Yoshi2	Espyo: at least that "only" happens on two days per week, I guess I'll have to squeeze most of my homework into that time
2014-10-06 20:27:29	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2014-10-06 20:27:52	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yeah, it's probably for the best
2014-10-06 20:28:03	@Espyo	if you have a laptop, that'd be a great time to work on personal projects too
2014-10-06 20:28:08	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-06 20:28:11	Yoshi2	I need a laptop asap
2014-10-06 20:28:21	Yoshi2	haven't decided on one yet, though
2014-10-06 20:29:41	Yoshi2	this week will be very relaxed because the timetable does not go into action until next week, so I'll use that time to wrap some pikmin stuff up, and buy a new laptop
2014-10-06 20:30:19	@Espyo	Miles: what are the most notable glitches they fixed in 2.0.0?
2014-10-06 20:30:34	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-10-06 20:30:51	@Espyo	plus normally the first classes are usually just for the class to get acquainted and learning what each subject is about
2014-10-06 20:30:54	@Espyo	at least it is over here
2014-10-06 20:30:58	@Espyo	so it's pretty darn relaxed
2014-10-06 20:31:36	Miles	I'm not even sure, I stopped caring
2014-10-06 20:32:47	Yoshi2	ah, I wanted to dump the remaining music pieces from the demobgm file
2014-10-06 20:33:36	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-06 20:33:52	@Espyo	well, I'll probably be able to find something via Google
2014-10-06 20:37:56	Yoshi2	https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywy6t1qam9tlzwn/demobgm_musicoPiece%232.midi?dl=0 second melody in the file
2014-10-06 20:38:18	Yoshi2	sounds a bit messed up, I probably converted it incorrectly
2014-10-06 20:41:15	Yoshi2	third melody: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bow080u0qrmrrog/demobgm_musicPiece%233.midi?dl=0
2014-10-06 20:41:28	@Espyo	one sec
2014-10-06 20:42:15	Yoshi2	no problem, I'll continue dumping them and you can listen to them when you have some time to spare
2014-10-06 20:44:07	@Espyo	too...
2014-10-06 20:44:09	@Espyo	much...
2014-10-06 20:44:11	@Espyo	piano...
2014-10-06 20:44:28	@Espyo	 3rd looks like the sunset theme
2014-10-06 20:44:58	@Espyo	yep, it's it, has to be
2014-10-06 20:45:16	Yoshi2	I am unable to play the fourth melody, so I'll continue with the next one
2014-10-06 20:45:22	@Espyo	let me try only a few instruments on #2 with LMMS
2014-10-06 20:45:27	@Espyo	maybe I'll understand it
2014-10-06 20:46:04	@Espyo	oh, that massively helped
2014-10-06 20:46:19	@Espyo	it's the cutscene after you pluck a new Pikmin type
2014-10-06 20:46:28	Yoshi2	is that so?
2014-10-06 20:46:30	@Espyo	you see the Pikmin idle for a bit, up-close
2014-10-06 20:46:33	@Espyo	mhm, really looks like it
2014-10-06 20:46:36	Yoshi2	alright
2014-10-06 20:46:44	@Espyo	track #3 on it is the clearest, IMO
2014-10-06 20:47:24	Yoshi2	fifth music piece: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fv2fpmxudy3nymf/demobgm_musicPiece%235.midi?dl=0
2014-10-06 20:48:28	@Espyo	I know it's used
2014-10-06 20:48:40	@Espyo	hmmm...
2014-10-06 20:48:47	@Espyo	when the last ship part is gathered, maybe
2014-10-06 20:48:48	@Espyo	*?
2014-10-06 20:49:24	Yoshi2	possibly

2014-10-06 20:50:07	@Espyo	(^ handy link)
2014-10-06 20:50:32	Yoshi2	I am unable to play the sixth one, and we already covered the seventh one yesterday, so here is the last one
2014-10-06 20:51:43	Yoshi2	https://www.dropbox.com/s/gx04fl7wfdd2tfm/demobgm_musicPiece%238.midi?dl=0
2014-10-06 20:52:12	Yoshi2	it is probably another of Pikmin 1's themes
2014-10-06 20:52:16	@Espyo	ship complete
2014-10-06 20:52:21	Yoshi2	alright
2014-10-06 20:52:36	Yoshi2	demobgm officially contains no unused themes
2014-10-06 20:52:56	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-06 20:52:57	Yoshi2	(I just assume the remaining two which I couldn't play correctly yet are used too)
2014-10-06 20:53:03	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-06 20:56:25	Yoshi2	let's see why those themes cause issues
2014-10-06 20:56:54	Yoshi2	what if those are unused? That would make my efforts not useless :D
2014-10-06 20:56:59	@Espyo	mhm!
2014-10-06 20:57:16	@Espyo	unused content can be in the weirdest places
2014-10-06 20:57:19	@Espyo	so it's possible
2014-10-06 20:57:57	Yoshi2	oh, I used the wrong offset for the fourth track
2014-10-06 20:58:42	Yoshi2	fourth track: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3o3eh8vymibye0/demobgm_musicPiece%234.midi?dl=0
2014-10-06 21:01:22	Yoshi2	got the sixth one to work too, except the midi file cuts off too early in my media player
2014-10-06 21:02:03	Yoshi2	https://www.dropbox.com/s/c12afo0hdpuv7mc/demobgm_musicPiece%236.midi?dl=0
2014-10-06 21:02:17	@Espyo	wow, that ends like halfway through
2014-10-06 21:02:20	Yoshi2	yep
2014-10-06 21:02:22	@Espyo	but it's the ship part recovered theme
2014-10-06 21:02:23	Yoshi2	it is very short
2014-10-06 21:02:34	Yoshi2	alright, no unused content then
2014-10-06 21:04:18	Yoshi2	time to correct myself on the talk page
2014-10-06 21:06:51	Yoshi2	more debug text in pikise.jam!
2014-10-06 21:08:17	Yoshi2	but it feels odd talking about those files as if they were seperate, because by default the .arc file just lumps them together
2014-10-06 21:10:20	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-06 21:10:23	@Espyo	but they are separate
2014-10-06 21:10:26	@Espyo	.arc is just like .zip
2014-10-06 21:10:28	@Espyo	...kinda
2014-10-06 21:11:00	Yoshi2	.tar without the file structure
2014-10-06 21:11:15	Yoshi2	odd that they put the barc header into a different place
2014-10-06 21:12:32	@J	zip is a weird Windows thing that does too many things
2014-10-06 21:13:30	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-06 21:24:36	Yoshi2	pikise contains more tracks in a track, oh joy
2014-10-06 21:33:57	Yoshi2	hmm, pikise also uses 0xB1 events
2014-10-06 21:34:22	Yoshi2	I might be able to figure out what they do with enough examples
2014-10-06 21:43:02	@Espyo	hehehe

2014-10-07 18:17:57	@Espyo	hey
2014-10-07 18:19:32	Yoshi2	hey again
2014-10-07 18:43:45	@J	Iunno, we discussed it and that's what we ended up with
2014-10-07 18:43:58	@J	certainly I'd put them before nav boxes
2014-10-07 18:44:12	@Espyo	before navboxes, yeah
2014-10-07 18:44:18	@Espyo	but we did discuss references would be dead last
2014-10-07 18:44:30	@Espyo	several reasons, it's what other sites use, you only access that section from links, ...
2014-10-07 18:44:38	@Espyo	so... why is it like 4th from the bottom on our policy?
2014-10-07 18:44:42	@J	huh...
2014-10-07 18:44:45	@J	yeah, we did
2014-10-07 18:44:55	@J	I guess I just forgot when copy/pasting
2014-10-07 18:45:03	@Espyo	right
2014-10-07 18:45:09	@Espyo	wonder if the order's messed up anywhere else?
2014-10-07 18:45:37	@J	nope, that's the only change we discussed and I'd've copy/pasted your order
2014-10-07 18:45:42	@Espyo	in other news, this guy from Pikmin Wiki chat is saying some bomb-rocks can be duds
2014-10-07 18:45:44	@Espyo	like, wtf
2014-10-07 18:45:48	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-10-07 18:47:30	@Espyo	the Brawl trophy for the Careening Dirigibug says they can sometimes drop duds
2014-10-07 18:47:32	@Espyo	but...
2014-10-07 18:47:42	@Espyo	me and this other guy both agree that we never heard anything of the sort, ever
2014-10-07 18:47:45	@Espyo	heard, seen or experienced
2014-10-07 18:47:56	@Espyo	and if it were just the CDs doing it, maybe it's ultra-rare
2014-10-07 18:48:03	@Espyo	but now this guy's claiming normal bomb-rocks can be duds too?
2014-10-07 18:48:14	@J	oh, yeah
2014-10-07 18:48:22	@J	I was thinking I'd heard something like that before
2014-10-07 18:48:30	@J	that has been discussed
2014-10-07 18:48:34	@Espyo	it has?
2014-10-07 18:48:35	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-07 18:48:40	@J	I think we determined it lies
2014-10-07 18:49:19	@J	'Interestingly, the trophy description details that Careening Dirigibugs occasionally throw dud bomb-rocks, which is not true in Pikmin 2.'
2014-10-07 18:49:34	@J	I might even have chat logs
2014-10-07 18:49:41	@Espyo	I added that like a year ago, after... something

2014-10-07 23:37:38	@Espyo	hmm, of course
2014-10-07 23:38:01	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Main_Page don't know if you can tell the colors of the boxes apart that well
2014-10-07 23:38:06	@Espyo	but I was meant to be subtle
2014-10-07 23:38:35	@Espyo	turns out changing the intensity of a color by two points (/255) is a huge difference
2014-10-07 23:38:41	@Espyo	I was hoping for something barely noticeable
2014-10-07 23:39:08	@J	looks kind of strange

2014-10-07 23:39:48	@Espyo	all right, it's unanimous
2014-10-07 23:39:51	@Espyo	it's not subtle enough
2014-10-07 23:39:58	@Espyo	and too subtle might look dumb too
2014-10-07 23:40:08	@Espyo	so I won't give this much thought — if it works subtle, good, if not, I'll forget the entire thing
2014-10-07 23:40:09	@J	that's more than 2
2014-10-07 23:40:15	@J	you switched between c9 and ef
2014-10-07 23:40:22	@Espyo	 2 points on intensity
2014-10-07 23:40:25	@Espyo	HSV
2014-10-07 23:40:27	@J	that's 38/255
2014-10-07 23:40:30	@Espyo	sorry, saturation
2014-10-07 23:40:39	@Espyo	intensity isn't even a thing
2014-10-07 23:40:50	@J	wait, but they all have different hues
2014-10-07 23:40:54	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-07 23:41:05	@J	now I'm confused
2014-10-07 23:41:20	@J	anyway, yeah, rainbow main page looks crazy
2014-10-07 23:41:30	@J	oh, I never commented on the main page
2014-10-07 23:41:38	@Espyo	now's your chance
2014-10-07 23:41:39	@J	let me just type all the things since I have to go
2014-10-07 23:41:44	@Espyo	right
2014-10-07 23:41:58	@Espyo	all right, I really have to approach this differently
2014-10-07 23:42:05	@Espyo	no wonder I confused you — this isn't what I was envisioning
2014-10-07 23:42:32	@J	some the big images in Navigation could do with alts
2014-10-07 23:42:46	@J	logo being duplicated seems kind of weird
2014-10-07 23:43:00	@Espyo	eh, I just used the images they have
2014-10-07 23:43:05	@Espyo	we'll clean the dupes eventually
2014-10-07 23:43:06	@J	it's worse than the previous main page at small widths (did you add some 'min-width's?)
2014-10-07 23:43:12	@Espyo	alts as in image alt?
2014-10-07 23:43:20	@Espyo	uh, I haven't, no
2014-10-07 23:43:25	@J	you removed the fanon link (I guess you thought the sidebar/NIWA box were enough?)
2014-10-07 23:43:26	@Espyo	won't min-width end up breaking stuff?
2014-10-07 23:43:29	@J	yeah, image alt
2014-10-07 23:43:32	@Espyo	like, I think our own body has a min-width
2014-10-07 23:43:42	@Espyo	the fanon link is there
2014-10-07 23:43:44	@Espyo	on the community box
2014-10-07 23:43:52	@Espyo	I just could not for the life of me find a spot for it on the main text
2014-10-07 23:44:23	@J	well, not sure why, but it doesn't seem to be able to go as narrow
2014-10-07 23:44:51	@J	news sections/pages are historically really badly maintained on Pikipedia, so good luck with that
2014-10-07 23:45:16	@Espyo	probably not as bad as the the featured article
2014-10-07 23:45:18	@Espyo	*-the
2014-10-07 23:45:23	@J	did the FA box always have a tooltip?
2014-10-07 23:45:24	@Espyo	we've had our current one for ONE YEAR
2014-10-07 23:45:37	@Espyo	uh... it shouldn't
2014-10-07 23:45:48	@J	hmm, true, but it doesn't look as bad because it's not timestamped
2014-10-07 23:45:56	@Espyo	eek, you're right
2014-10-07 23:46:00	@Espyo	we'll come up with something
2014-10-07 23:46:15	@Espyo	hey, some other wikis have slow news too
2014-10-07 23:46:23	@J	but yeah, it mostly makes sense
2014-10-07 23:46:26	@Espyo	I'm already trying to compensate by posting news about new pages and projects
2014-10-07 23:46:35	@Espyo	what about the random content section at the bottom-right?
2014-10-07 23:46:39	@J	that Pikmin icon is partially decapitated...
2014-10-07 23:46:41	@J	(no leaf
2014-10-07 23:46:42	@J	)
2014-10-07 23:47:06	@Espyo	yeah, I rushed it
2014-10-07 23:47:13	@Espyo	it's really hard coming up with a good Pikmin icon
2014-10-07 23:47:17	@Espyo	and the ones at the end of day in Pikmin 2 are...
2014-10-07 23:47:25	@Espyo	somehow, they're the worst textures in the game
2014-10-07 23:47:26	@J	perhaps the random content could go top-right, so the image isn't as near the FA image
2014-10-07 23:47:27	@Espyo	in all regards
2014-10-07 23:47:51	@Espyo	oh, the random content either has an image, or transcripts, if you couldn't tell
2014-10-07 23:47:56	@J	oh, and the Pikmin logo is smaller than the other two
2014-10-07 23:47:58	@Espyo	we could as well get rid of the featured image, I was never fond of it
2014-10-07 23:48:05	@Espyo	yes, I've been meaning to fix that Pikmin logo for a while
2014-10-07 23:48:14	@Espyo	not sure what's up with it, nor why it won't bloody align vertically
2014-10-07 23:48:44	@J	I think it was just to have something else on the main page; maybe you think we've got enough other stuff
2014-10-07 23:48:50	@J	anyway, now I should go
2014-10-07 23:48:52	@J	goodnight
2014-10-07 23:48:57	@Espyo	night
2014-10-07 23:49:15	@Espyo	...it's nearly midnight
2014-10-07 23:49:16	@Espyo	good grief

2014-10-08 10:02:57	Yoshi2	morning Espyo 
2014-10-08 10:03:43	@Espyo	morning
2014-10-08 10:12:01	Yoshi2	I should probably update my code on github
2014-10-08 10:12:18	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-08 10:14:06	Yoshi2	sometimes I go into a coding frenzy, and I stop making commits until I'm done
2014-10-08 10:16:25	@Espyo	hah, I know what you mean
2014-10-08 10:29:17	Yoshi2	and I really need to add a CLI
2014-10-08 10:29:43	Yoshi2	I doubt anybody will be able to use this with me leaving traces of playing around with BMS files in the files
2014-10-08 10:33:51	@Espyo	hm, yeah, that is pretty notable
2014-10-08 10:49:22	Yoshi2	now I renamed the module that plays the music from the file to "pyBMS_play", and the module that converts the file to "pyBMS_convert2midi"
2014-10-08 10:49:36	Yoshi2	and the cli file will either be "pyBMS_toolkit" or just "pyBMS"
2014-10-08 10:49:40	Yoshi2	I am so creative
2014-10-08 10:49:55	@Espyo	does the job
2014-10-08 11:00:57	Yoshi2	I might have to create a single-file variant of it at some point
2014-10-08 11:01:34	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2014-10-08 11:02:42	Yoshi2	that will be messy, VERY messy
2014-10-08 11:04:02	@Espyo	as it normally is, yep
2014-10-08 11:04:56	Yoshi2	I will have to rewrite the way I do parsing
2014-10-08 11:05:09	Yoshi2	just to cut down on the amount of duplicate code
2014-10-08 11:06:20	Yoshi2	well
2014-10-08 11:06:41	Yoshi2	I might just hack together a single file version and put it among the other stuff on github
2014-10-08 11:06:54	Yoshi2	when I find more time, I'll rewrite that stuff
2014-10-08 11:07:07	@Espyo	yeah, that's the best idea, really
2014-10-08 11:07:15	@Espyo	work first, pretty code later
2014-10-08 11:13:31	Yoshi2	the number of good laptops in the 400-600€ range is quite low
2014-10-08 11:13:48	@Espyo	it really is
2014-10-08 11:13:54	@Espyo	mine's decent, but cost 500€
2014-10-08 11:14:22	Yoshi2	I might just go for for the surface 1 pro
2014-10-08 11:14:32	Yoshi2	http://www.ebay.de/itm/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-256GB-256-GB-Tablet-PC-Windows-8-i5-CPU-4GB-RAM-NEU-OVP-/371091831554
2014-10-08 11:14:35	@Espyo	isn't that a touch?
2014-10-08 11:14:42	Yoshi2	yeah
2014-10-08 11:14:47	@Espyo	right...
2014-10-08 11:14:52	@Espyo	you sure that's what you want?
2014-10-08 11:15:16	Yoshi2	I do want a laptop with an SSD, and those are rare
2014-10-08 11:15:37	@Espyo	very
2014-10-08 11:15:43	Yoshi2	the type cover is an additional 100€, bringing this up to ~600€
2014-10-08 11:15:53	Yoshi2	and 600€ is roughly the price of other devices with an SSD
2014-10-08 11:16:07	Yoshi2	I will have to see how good this type cover is
2014-10-08 11:16:11	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-10-08 11:16:18	Yoshi2	some of my friends are quite happy with the surface
2014-10-08 11:17:04	Yoshi2	a lighter device is also preferable because I'll have to carry it around a lot
2014-10-08 11:17:06	@Espyo	not sure how good it'd be for game-related things
2014-10-08 11:17:11	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-08 11:17:31	Yoshi2	but I don't do game-related things
2014-10-08 11:17:41	Yoshi2	or do you mean playing games?
2014-10-08 11:18:00	@Espyo	not just playing
2014-10-08 11:18:07	@Espyo	but like, for instance, what you're doing now
2014-10-08 11:18:10	@Espyo	with the GameCube files
2014-10-08 11:18:20	@Espyo	you may need at one point to start Dolphin and test something
2014-10-08 11:18:31	@Espyo	and with a surface... I can't really see it happening well
2014-10-08 11:18:36	Yoshi2	heh
2014-10-08 11:18:41	@Espyo	but playing too, I guess
2014-10-08 11:18:56	@Espyo	does it even have a keyboard?
2014-10-08 11:19:02	@Espyo	I gotta say I'm not too familiar with these
2014-10-08 11:19:13	Yoshi2	that's the type cover that is sold separately
2014-10-08 11:19:54	Yoshi2	http://www.amazon.de/MICROSOFT-Type-Cover-Surface-schwarz/dp/B00G470QCA hmmm
2014-10-08 11:19:58	Yoshi2	doesn't look stable
2014-10-08 11:19:59	@Espyo	ah
2014-10-08 11:20:10	Yoshi2	I want to work with it on the train
2014-10-08 11:20:23	Yoshi2	let's see what people say about that
2014-10-08 11:21:03	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-08 11:21:16	Yoshi2	"Microsoft Surface Love Train" wtf
2014-10-08 11:21:20	Yoshi2	that is not what I want
2014-10-08 11:21:23	@Espyo	hah!
2014-10-08 11:23:45	Yoshi2	the decision to buy the surface will stand or fall with its ability to be used on the train with a keyboard
2014-10-08 11:26:16	@Espyo	right, which makes SSD a lot more important
2014-10-08 11:26:22	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-08 11:26:27	Yoshi2	trains can be rather bumpy
2014-10-08 11:32:29	Yoshi2	hmmm
2014-10-08 11:32:46	Yoshi2	I'll have to ask my friend who has one about the stability of the surface
2014-10-08 11:33:51	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-08 11:36:23	Yoshi2	http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/hands-on-using-microsofts-surface-pro-3-as-a-laptop-on-my-lap/ talks about the Surface 3 having something that improves usage on the lap, but I'm not getting that one
2014-10-08 11:37:29	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-08 11:38:34	Yoshi2	http://www.tested.com/tech/windows/458858-testing-microsoft-surface-2-laptop/
2014-10-08 11:38:38	Yoshi2	" I was much less worked about wobbliness and stability than I was about the screen falling backward if I wasn't being careful."
2014-10-08 11:39:17	Yoshi2	and the surface 1 apparently has a few things worse
2014-10-08 11:41:05	Yoshi2	really too bad, I actually love the idea of being able to use something as a tablet and a laptop
2014-10-08 11:41:23	Yoshi2	but most of the convertibles are expensive if you want them to be decent
2014-10-08 11:53:46	Yoshi2	hmmm, very difficult to decide
2014-10-08 11:58:12	@Espyo	ouch
2014-10-08 11:58:23	@Espyo	yeah, it's really gonna be hard to choose
2014-10-08 11:58:25	@Espyo	good luck
2014-10-08 11:58:49	Yoshi2	the surface 1 appears to have worse angles with its kickstand, some say that it only goes to a bit more than 20 degrees
2014-10-08 11:59:02	@Espyo	wut
2014-10-08 11:59:04	@Espyo	that's horrible
2014-10-08 11:59:33	Yoshi2	definitely not good for train rides
2014-10-08 12:02:03	Yoshi2	oh well, let's look around for the laptop alternatives
2014-10-08 12:02:49	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-08 12:03:27	Yoshi2	considering that ~600€ would be the price for this with a type cover, I guess we can have that as the upper limit
2014-10-08 12:04:43	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-08 12:07:08	Yoshi2	there are quite a few devices specified as ultrabooks in this category
2014-10-08 12:10:37	Yoshi2	lots of devices which are only sold used :/
2014-10-08 12:15:20	Yoshi2	I'll have to write down some devices of interest and take a look at them in one of the shops nearby
2014-10-08 12:16:21	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-08 12:22:34	Yoshi2	I have some time to kill in a productive way, so I think I'll go take a look later today
2014-10-08 12:22:45	@Espyo	all right

2014-10-08 14:58:28	@Espyo	oh, ok... why?
2014-10-08 14:58:47	@Espyo	that caught me off-guard :|

2014-10-08 14:59:37	@PikFan	so I figured, why not make you admin?

2014-10-08 15:01:48	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-08 15:01:56	@Espyo	last time I tried changing the background, everything went kaput
2014-10-08 15:02:04	@PikFan	heh
2014-10-08 15:02:09	@PikFan	is it really an issue?
2014-10-08 15:02:18	@Espyo	probably not

2014-10-08 15:03:06	@PikFan	heh, biggest undertaking ever

2014-10-08 15:03:40	@Espyo	maybe even bigger than the engine
2014-10-08 15:03:50	@PikFan	probably
2014-10-08 15:04:01	@PikFan	oh yeah, I woke up some time ago to watch the lunar eclipse
2014-10-08 15:04:24	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-08 15:04:32	@Espyo	well, it's morning here, so...
2014-10-08 15:04:36	@Espyo	(afternoon)
2014-10-08 15:04:52	@PikFan	total eclipse ended around 4:30
2014-10-08 15:04:54	@PikFan	am
2014-10-08 15:04:58	@PikFan	uh...
2014-10-08 15:05:20	@PikFan	then the partial eclipse ended at... 5:30? I want to say
2014-10-08 15:05:27	@Espyo	hmm, dunno
2014-10-08 15:05:33	@PikFan	also, I took a picture of it using my phone
2014-10-08 15:05:42	@PikFan	...but it was just a red dot :|
2014-10-08 15:05:46	@PikFan	nothing memorable
2014-10-08 15:06:20	@PikFan	if people ask me for a picture of it, I'll have to show them a red dot
2014-10-08 15:06:26	@Espyo	hehe
2014-10-08 15:06:33	@Espyo	it's not easy taking a picture like that
2014-10-08 15:06:50	@PikFan	if only I had an actual camera
2014-10-08 15:07:36	@PikFan	how's Smash 4?
2014-10-08 15:08:00	@Espyo	awesome fun
2014-10-08 15:08:07	@PikFan	nice
2014-10-08 15:08:33	@PikFan	aaah, I thought last Christmas, "there's probably nothing I want next Christmas"
2014-10-08 15:08:40	@PikFan	and now I want tons of things...
2014-10-08 15:08:45	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-08 15:08:46	@PikFan	drat
2014-10-08 15:08:56	Yoshi2	by next christmas, Smash 4 on the Wii U will be out
2014-10-08 15:09:15	@PikFan	let's see, I want Smash 4 on Wii U, Hyrule Warriors
2014-10-08 15:09:19	@PikFan	and some other stuff
2014-10-08 15:09:24	Yoshi2	I want HW too
2014-10-08 15:09:27	@PikFan	/possibly/ a skateboard
2014-10-08 15:09:38	@PikFan	(my friend is turning me into a skater, heh)
2014-10-08 15:09:57	@Espyo	I'd like HW, but I'm not really craving
2014-10-08 15:09:58	@PikFan	uh, what else...?
2014-10-08 15:10:17	@PikFan	ooh, forgot
2014-10-08 15:10:18	@Espyo	oh, supposedly, the GCN adapter for Smash 4 will work with Pikmin 3
2014-10-08 15:10:29	@PikFan	waitwhat
2014-10-08 15:10:32	@PikFan	really?
2014-10-08 15:10:32	@Espyo	but apparently that was just a mistake, and it's for SSB4WiiU only
2014-10-08 15:10:39	@PikFan	oh
2014-10-08 15:10:52	@Espyo	don't see why it wouldn't work with MK8 and Pikmin 3, they'd just have to release updates
2014-10-08 15:11:01	@Espyo	Nintendo, it's been a bit over a year, not a decade
2014-10-08 15:11:05	@PikFan	meh, even if it did, Wii Remote would probably still be the best choice
2014-10-08 15:11:23	@PikFan	because the cursor has an unlimited range
2014-10-08 15:11:33	@PikFan	where as in P1 and P2, the cursor was fixed
2014-10-08 15:11:48	@PikFan	so it was easy to move it around without trouble
2014-10-08 15:11:48	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-08 15:12:01	@Espyo	GCN for P3 might be like the GamePad and not much else
2014-10-08 15:12:08	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-10-08 15:12:20	@PikFan	the cursor kinda has to be unlimited, though
2014-10-08 15:12:34	@PikFan	when you've got those boss fights and Pikmin are being thrown everywhere
2014-10-08 15:12:36	Yoshi2	after playing Pikmin 2, I noticed that the original controls for Pikmin 3 on the Wii U Gamepad were basically the same as in Pikmin 2
2014-10-08 15:13:11	@PikFan	hmm
2014-10-08 15:14:21	@Espyo	yeah, they're not much different
2014-10-08 15:14:26	@Espyo	you can whistle anywhere in P3
2014-10-08 15:14:47	@Espyo	hey, remember when we thought the Cloaking Burrow-nit in Pikmin 3 was the Joustmite?
2014-10-08 15:14:54	@Espyo	and now that we have Pikmin 3, we see they're very different?
2014-10-08 15:15:31	@PikFan	we've known that they're different for some time
2014-10-08 15:15:52	@Espyo	we've had the Joustmites on the CBN article for a year now
2014-10-08 15:15:55	@Espyo	I just cleaned up today
2014-10-08 15:16:00	@PikFan	there was an edit conflict on their pages
2014-10-08 15:16:29	@Espyo	hmm?

2014-10-08 15:17:09	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-08 15:17:21	@PikFan	he kept insisting that the Joustmite was the CBN
2014-10-08 15:17:27	@PikFan	something like that
2014-10-08 15:17:38	@Espyo	hmm... can't really remember

2014-10-08 15:18:15	@Espyo	ah yeah
2014-10-08 15:18:17	@Espyo	that speculation
2014-10-08 15:26:05	@PikFan	it'd be nice if Nintendo could release an update giving you more camera controls
2014-10-08 15:26:30	@Espyo	hmm...
2014-10-08 15:26:35	@Espyo	yeah, sometimes it's annoying
2014-10-08 15:27:09	@PikFan	and then there's another thing (but it's mostly on my part)
2014-10-08 15:27:22	@PikFan	you should be able to move while in the camera app on the KopPad
2014-10-08 15:27:33	@PikFan	and be able to take short videos
2014-10-08 15:30:08	@Espyo	short videos would be impossibly complex
2014-10-08 15:30:16	@Espyo	moving, not so much, but could present some glitches, maybe
2014-10-08 15:30:29	@Espyo	if you could have control of movement and vision, you could see stuff you weren't meant to
2014-10-08 15:30:40	@PikFan	impossibly complex...?
2014-10-08 15:30:54	@Espyo	not impossible, but millions of times more complicated than it's wroth
2014-10-08 15:30:56	@Espyo	*worth
2014-10-08 15:31:03	@Espyo	there'd be the problem of saving them, for one thing
2014-10-08 15:31:39	@PikFan	mind you, I said short videos, so only up to 10 seconds long
2014-10-08 15:31:44	@Espyo	even still
2014-10-08 15:31:45	@PikFan	that's what, 600 frames?
2014-10-08 15:32:00	@Espyo	if they're to have any sort of redeeming quality, that's ~20MB you're looking at it
2014-10-08 15:32:11	@Espyo	a save file takes like 1/200th of that
2014-10-08 15:32:24	@Espyo	putting it on Miiverse would probably break the planet
2014-10-08 15:32:43	@Espyo	*~20MB you're looking at
2014-10-08 15:33:02	@Espyo	eh, maybe glitches with the camera while moving doesn't make sense
2014-10-08 15:33:08	@Espyo	you can use the camera and you can move
2014-10-08 15:33:15	@Espyo	so seeing stuff you shouldn't is already possible

2014-10-08 15:33:41	@PikFan	there technically is a way to move and have the camera open
2014-10-08 15:34:05	@PikFan	you just use Go here on the active captain, then launch the camera app
2014-10-08 15:35:17	@Espyo	mhm, I noticed

2014-10-08 20:40:14	@Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmqzPQkyvFo wow
2014-10-08 20:40:46	@J	hmm, never seen a live GLSL editor before; seems like it would be really useful when learning it
2014-10-08 20:40:59	@J	the site is a bit weird, though - there's no scrollbar
2014-10-08 20:41:48	@Espyo	there are pages
2014-10-08 20:41:53	@Espyo	some of the things there are jaw-dropping
2014-10-08 20:51:57	Yoshi2	sadly, none of the stores I visited today had any good and affordable notebooks with an SSD
2014-10-08 20:52:32	Yoshi2	they were either low-end with a tiny monitor and a tiny SSD (32 GB), or high-end and very expensive
2014-10-08 20:55:59	@Espyo	that sucks, but it's to be expected
2014-10-08 20:57:25	@J	I never really felt any need to have an SSD
2014-10-08 20:58:07	Yoshi2	I don't really need a 500 GB HDD on the go, especially when I'm going to carry it around a lot
2014-10-08 21:01:11	@J	what, are laptops with SSDs much lighter or something?
2014-10-08 21:01:18	@J	I don't really understand any of your reasoning
2014-10-08 21:03:38	@Espyo	if you carry a laptop around while it's on, the disk might scratch
2014-10-08 21:03:43	@Espyo	and he plans on using it on the train
2014-10-08 21:03:48	@Espyo	that problem doesn't happen with SSDs
2014-10-08 21:04:02	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-08 21:04:06	@J	hmm
2014-10-08 21:04:16	@J	does that actually happen?
2014-10-08 21:04:44	Yoshi2	it is probably unlikely to happen
2014-10-08 21:04:58	@Espyo	oh it does
2014-10-08 21:05:05	@Espyo	my last laptop needed an HDD replacement
2014-10-08 21:05:08	@Espyo	very likely because of that
2014-10-08 21:05:12	@Espyo	it was a healthy laptop in all regards
2014-10-08 21:05:25	@Espyo	so when we discovered the disk was all busted, we wondered why
2014-10-08 21:05:35	@Espyo	then we learned that they can scratch if they're on while being carried
2014-10-08 21:05:37	@Espyo	and it all made sense
2014-10-08 21:05:45	@Espyo	I used to bring it back and forth in college
2014-10-08 21:05:51	@Espyo	while on
2014-10-08 21:06:05	@Espyo	I suppose it only really causes any problems if there's a lot of disk activity and you're a brute
2014-10-08 21:06:14	Yoshi2	some notebooks have software to reduce that risk, but I wouldn't rely on that
2014-10-08 21:06:17	@Espyo	so it should be fine if you suspend and be gentle
2014-10-08 21:06:20	@Espyo	but even stil...
2014-10-08 21:06:22	@Espyo	*still
2014-10-08 21:06:23	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-08 21:06:27	Yoshi2	I still want an SSD
2014-10-08 21:07:18	Yoshi2	alright, let's take a look at the options I found on the internet
2014-10-08 21:10:10	Yoshi2	one option I liked is this one: http://www.amazon.de/Lenovo-U330p-Notebook-i5-4210U-Betriebssystem/dp/B00KGSHI4C
2014-10-08 21:10:11	Testyo	4 C = 39.2 °F / 277.15 K
2014-10-08 21:10:51	Yoshi2	256 GB SSD, and the entire thing only costs 600€
2014-10-08 21:10:52	Testyo	600 € = £ 513.12  / $ 813.84 
2014-10-08 21:11:16	Yoshi2	the CPU is decent enough, though the system comes without an OS
2014-10-08 21:11:37	Yoshi2	so I'll have to grab windows from the dreamspark program
2014-10-08 21:12:37	Yoshi2	Lenovo U330p
2014-10-08 21:12:40	Yoshi2	oops
2014-10-08 21:12:55	Yoshi2	wanted to google for what other people have to say about it
2014-10-08 21:20:10	Yoshi2	it has no lan port, that is bad
2014-10-08 21:23:05	Yoshi2	I'll have to use an usb adapter for that
2014-10-08 21:24:01	Yoshi2	the brightness is low, and apparently the wlan range isn't too great
2014-10-08 21:25:49	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-08 21:26:18	Yoshi2	those are some major issues
2014-10-08 21:27:36	@Espyo	they sure are
2014-10-08 21:28:09	Yoshi2	it is really a shame, looked like a good device
2014-10-08 21:30:19	@J	okay, now I'm wondering how 'frequent' sounds like in German
2014-10-08 21:30:28	@J	I want to say the 'qu' becomes 'kv' or something
2014-10-08 21:33:53	Yoshi2	http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/frequent
2014-10-08 21:34:03	Yoshi2	apparently "frequent" exists in German too
2014-10-08 21:34:15	Yoshi2	but people will usually say "oft" or "häufig"
2014-10-08 21:34:21	Yoshi2	or something like that
2014-10-08 21:35:19	@J	yeah, I mean, it says 'Turbofrequent' on that page
2014-10-08 21:35:26	@J	that's what I meant
2014-10-08 21:36:29	@J	I was talking about pronounciation (unless I'm blind, that's not on that page)
2014-10-08 21:36:44	Yoshi2	oh, I see
2014-10-08 21:43:40	Yoshi2	a bit lower on the page it says "Aussprache", which means Pronounciation
2014-10-08 21:43:48	Yoshi2	frequẹnt
2014-10-08 21:46:59	@J	hmm
2014-10-08 21:47:10	@J	not sure that really means anything to me
2014-10-08 21:47:16	@J	why wouldn't you just use IPA?
2014-10-08 21:47:28	@J	well, I don't especially care, I was just wondering
2014-10-08 22:04:08	@Espyo	all right, which of these sections should come first? technical info or in other games?

2014-10-08 22:08:37	@J	in other games
2014-10-08 22:08:49	@J	just because I feel like non-text should come last
2014-10-08 22:08:56	@J	(tables, images, boxes)
2014-10-08 22:09:09	@J	or something
2014-10-08 22:09:14	@J	non-body-text, I guess
2014-10-08 22:10:39	Yoshi2	J: I found an IPA of the word: https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/frequent
2014-10-08 22:10:55	Yoshi2	looks like your guess with qu becoming kv is very close
2014-10-08 22:11:05	@Espyo	makes sense

2014-10-08 22:19:10	Yoshi2	although when I say it, there is a bit of an u between the k and v
2014-10-08 22:19:44	@J	hmm
2014-10-08 22:19:52	@J	is German your native language?
2014-10-08 22:20:44	Yoshi2	technically it isn't
2014-10-08 22:22:43	Yoshi2	but I went to school in Germany, so I've got a pretty good knowledge of it
2014-10-08 22:23:19	@J	so do you speak 3 languages well, or is it English?
2014-10-08 22:24:48	Yoshi2	3 languages with varying degrees of success
2014-10-08 22:26:41	@Espyo	huh
2014-10-08 22:26:46	@J	well, your English is really good (better than Espyo's, I won't hesitate to point out), so that's quite impressive
2014-10-08 22:26:48	@Espyo	I just made a shortcut for the section order
2014-10-08 22:26:51	@Espyo	h-hey!

2014-10-08 22:27:05	@Espyo	you type in English every day
2014-10-08 22:27:08	@Espyo	but you say "Olinar" once...
2014-10-08 22:27:16	@J	I didn't say you have bad English
2014-10-08 22:27:27	@Espyo	well, but it's not perfect
2014-10-08 22:27:29	@J	(well, I didn't say you don't)
2014-10-08 22:27:31	@Espyo	that's not what I'm aiming for
2014-10-08 22:27:56	Yoshi2	my written English is decent enough, but actually speaking English is a different nut to crack
2014-10-08 22:28:07	@Espyo	anyway, real quick, should the "in other games" go before or after "glitches"?
2014-10-08 22:28:10	@Espyo	I'm feeling after
2014-10-08 22:28:17	@Espyo	oh, you need practice
2014-10-08 22:28:58	@J	gut feeling is after
2014-10-08 22:30:01	@J	either way, it must be hard to keep track of even two languages without mixing up colloquialisms and stuff
2014-10-08 22:30:13	Yoshi2	practicing is one thing, but you also need to learn how every word is pronounced
2014-10-08 22:30:44	Yoshi2	I saw a poem about that recently
2014-10-08 22:30:58	@J	mm, that's one thing that's much easier going to German than English
2014-10-08 22:31:14	@J	English has way too many exceptions all over the place
2014-10-08 22:31:41	Yoshi2	English is simplified at the cost of other things, such as pronounciation
2014-10-08 22:33:25	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-08 22:33:34	@Espyo	I find English pronunciation easy
2014-10-08 22:33:42	@Espyo	but I had a lot of problem with "th", mostly
2014-10-08 22:34:09	Yoshi2	sometimes I think that I can mimic, e.g., a British accent very well
2014-10-08 22:34:20	Yoshi2	and other times, I just fail to pronounce some words in a way that makes sense

2014-10-08 22:36:22	@J	I mean, even as a native speaker, if I've only ever seen a word written, not heard it spoken, there are lots of cases where you just can't know how to pronounce it

2014-10-08 22:37:37	Yoshi2	yep, that sounds about right
2014-10-08 22:37:50	@J	plus US pronounciations are leaking into British English, at least for uncommon words

2014-10-08 22:40:10	@Espyo	most times I see a new word and give pronunciation a try, it's spot on

2014-10-08 22:40:28	@Espyo	better than Olinar
2014-10-08 22:40:36	PikFan23	lol
2014-10-08 22:40:39	PikFan23	yes...
2014-10-08 22:40:42	@Espyo	I actually wrote Olinar before
2014-10-08 22:40:48	@Espyo	...when trying to write Online
2014-10-08 22:40:49	PikFan23	._.
2014-10-08 22:40:56	PikFan23	well, isn't that amazing
2014-10-08 22:40:56	Yoshi2	Espyo: sometimes you can make a guess and get it right, but even if it sounds right, you won't know that until you have looked it up
2014-10-08 22:41:00	@J	but there are even common words - things like 'then' versus 'thing'
2014-10-08 22:41:11	@J	that illustrate what I mean
2014-10-08 22:41:21	PikFan23	<Espyo>: hye
2014-10-08 22:41:30	PikFan23	sounds like "hi", misspelling of "hey"
2014-10-08 22:41:33	PikFan23	perfect
2014-10-08 22:41:47	Yoshi2	sounds like "hi"?
2014-10-08 22:42:05	@J	oh, I didn't even realise it was meant to be 'hey'; I just thought it was 'hi' gone really wrong
2014-10-08 22:42:09	@J	Olinar-level wrong
2014-10-08 22:42:14	PikFan23	hehe
2014-10-08 22:42:29	@J	(spoiler: Olinar = Online)
2014-10-08 22:42:30	PikFan23	that's what I thought too, but I realized he meant "hey"
2014-10-08 22:43:14	PikFan23	anyway
2014-10-08 22:43:20	PikFan23	I'm playing Truth or Dare with my friends
2014-10-08 22:45:20	Yoshi2	who is winning?
2014-10-08 22:46:00	PikFan23	no one
2014-10-08 22:46:13	PikFan23	although my friend was dared to write "penis" on my hand...
2014-10-08 22:46:27	PikFan23	I have... interesting friends
2014-10-08 22:47:16	Yoshi2	friends with class
2014-10-08 22:48:52	PikFan23	well, one of them I know in class
2014-10-08 22:49:01	PikFan23	but I'm best friends with them

2014-10-09 20:11:15	@Espyo	early... release?
2014-10-09 20:11:20	@Espyo	also I still don't know what's wrong
2014-10-09 20:11:24	@Espyo	the fact that it's lowercase?
2014-10-09 20:11:25	@Espyo	the games do it
2014-10-09 20:11:30	@Espyo	"bulborb" appears loads of times
2014-10-09 20:11:48	@Espyo	which reminds me, canonically, and in all three games for that matter, Pikmin types are not capitalized
2014-10-09 20:11:51	@Espyo	Pikmin is, but the types aren't
2014-10-09 20:11:59	@Espyo	so we need to get rid of Red Pikmin, and put red Pikmin
2014-10-09 20:12:10	@Espyo	or else we're just Randomly capitalizing the First letter Of Some words
2014-10-09 20:12:24	Yoshi2	I Do Not See a Problem With That
2014-10-09 20:13:10	@Espyo	— a book by John Uppercase
2014-10-09 20:32:58	@J	it's far too late to fix it
2014-10-09 20:33:05	@J	though we knew it years ago
2014-10-09 20:33:24	@J	like, it was discussed 8 years ago
2014-10-09 20:33:27	@J	(I feel so old)
2014-10-09 20:33:44	Yoshi2	damn
2014-10-09 20:33:46	@Espyo	the wiki is 9 years old
2014-10-09 20:33:49	@Espyo	really makes you think
2014-10-09 20:33:52	@Espyo	feels like it's less than 5
2014-10-09 20:33:57	@Espyo	here's an idea
2014-10-09 20:34:05	@Espyo	wikians love community stuff
2014-10-09 20:34:10	@Espyo	let's make small challenges
2014-10-09 20:34:25	@Espyo	the "fix the types" challenge starts on X/Y and lasts for a week
2014-10-09 20:34:39	@Espyo	during, everybody goes through articles and fixes all instances of Red, Blue, etc.
2014-10-09 20:34:44	@Espyo	the amount of edits before and after is counter
2014-10-09 20:34:48	@Espyo	*counted
2014-10-09 20:34:57	@Espyo	and the one that contributed the most to the project wins insert reward here
2014-10-09 20:35:36	@Espyo	these rankings should be global, so that people further behind can still compete for 2nd or 3rd, which'll give them an advantage next challenge
2014-10-09 20:35:44	@Espyo	and just like that, we fix three problems
2014-10-09 20:35:48	@J	do they really _never_ capitalise those in the games/manuals?
2014-10-09 20:35:50	@Espyo	lack of activity: gone
2014-10-09 20:36:02	@Espyo	the wikians lazying around: not any more
2014-10-09 20:36:09	@Espyo	the incorrect capitalization: fixes
2014-10-09 20:36:11	@Espyo	*fixed
2014-10-09 20:36:20	@Espyo	it'd probably take some planning
2014-10-09 20:36:32	@Espyo	hmm, don't think they do
2014-10-09 20:36:36	@Espyo	but the games speak higher than the manuals
2014-10-09 20:36:42	@J	I'll totally do nothing then suddenly bot win

2014-10-09 20:38:52	@Espyo	well yeah, but if all goes right, they'll fix everything before you even have time to code the function
2014-10-09 20:38:56	@Espyo	they're crazy for achievements it seems
2014-10-09 20:38:59	@Espyo	(overstatement)

2014-10-09 20:41:38	Yoshi2	well, what do I do?
2014-10-09 20:47:23	@Espyo	well, I already threw the manual away from me

2014-10-09 20:51:02	@Espyo	the update that made the alignment parameters optional... made them mandatory, it seems
2014-10-09 20:53:10	Yoshi2	awesome, a link to the manual
2014-10-09 20:53:28	Yoshi2	I like the way they answered the "I've been in this cave before" question
2014-10-09 20:53:44	Yoshi2	a good way to say "it is randomized"
2014-10-09 20:54:16	Yoshi2	and when you lose all white and purple Pikmin, you need to look into the caves again
2014-10-09 20:55:20	@Espyo	hehe, yeah

2014-10-09 21:02:22	@PikFan	also, if we go around correcting these thousands of mistakes, it'll be harder to identify Pikmin types
2014-10-09 21:02:34	@PikFan	Red Pikmin is more noticeable than red Pikmin
2014-10-09 21:02:59	@PikFan	(not harder necessarily, just not as noticeable)
2014-10-09 21:20:24	@Espyo	huh?
2014-10-09 21:20:27	@Espyo	when'd you return, PikFan?
2014-10-09 21:20:46	@Espyo	eh, but it's incorrect
2014-10-09 21:29:15	Yoshi2	if I had to guess, PikFan never left, only PikFan23 did

2014-10-09 21:45:23	@Espyo	it's a good edit
2014-10-09 21:45:31	@Espyo	but it does exactly the opposite of what the policy says
2014-10-09 21:46:34	@J	I thought policy said guides don't really matter, you can use either
2014-10-09 21:46:40	@Espyo	they do
2014-10-09 21:46:46	@J	also, that sentence was half 3rd person and half 2nd person
2014-10-09 21:46:48	@Espyo	but for consistency's sake, we just use the 2nd

2014-10-09 21:47:48	@J	nah, it's fine
2014-10-09 21:47:56	@J	guides can be non-specific

2014-10-09 21:48:52	@Espyo	into a guide on the Crawbster that talks to you as the player
2014-10-09 21:51:05	@J	hmm
2014-10-09 21:51:16	@J	are you saying you want to reword it, or not?
2014-10-09 21:51:42	@J	I'd say perspective doesn't matter so much as the tone - guides should just be less formal
2014-10-09 21:51:49	@J	and that's all you need to say
2014-10-09 21:56:27	@Espyo	eh
2014-10-09 21:56:32	@Espyo	perspective takes a role in it too
2014-10-09 21:56:41	@Espyo	I say we specifically say it should specifically be either you or the player

2014-10-09 23:34:23	@Espyo	huh
2014-10-09 23:41:29	@PikFan	hmm, maybe create two columns under one header and bold the first cell in each column?
2014-10-09 23:46:13	@J	did you try two header rows?
2014-10-09 23:46:29	@PikFan	hmm, how do you do that?
2014-10-09 23:46:49	@J	I don't know if you can - I just mean have two rows with ! instead of |

2014-10-10 22:52:45	@PikFan	hmm, I figured there'd be shenanigans
2014-10-10 22:53:04	@PikFan	probably because I didn't make [[Template:Button icon]] first

2014-10-10 23:04:02	@Espyo	huh?
2014-10-10 23:04:29	@PikFan	well, I tried a c+p of the Pikipedia version over Fanon's version
2014-10-10 23:04:32	@PikFan	of course, things broke
2014-10-10 23:04:43	@PikFan	it's probably because of different file names
2014-10-10 23:05:05	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-10-10 23:05:08	@PikFan	so I'm thinking I might need to manually merge it
2014-10-10 23:05:23	@PikFan	I say merge because Fanon has 3DS controls

2014-10-11 12:36:00	Yoshi2	good morning
2014-10-11 12:39:34	@Espyo	hey
2014-10-11 12:42:19	Yoshi2	I thought I had to throw away my computer because the CPU fan went crazy, but I somehow managed to fix that in the BIOS \o/
2014-10-11 12:49:39	@Espyo	whaa?
2014-10-11 12:49:40	@Espyo	how?
2014-10-11 12:50:10	Yoshi2	how it went crazy, or how I fixed it?
2014-10-11 12:52:17	@Espyo	both, really
2014-10-11 12:54:41	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Iridescent Glint Beetle by Espyo (-54 m Reworded, that was awkward.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Iridescent_Glint_Beetle&curid=715&diff=140585&oldid=140547
2014-10-11 12:55:19	Yoshi2	why it went crazy, no idea
2014-10-11 12:55:44	Yoshi2	I unplugged the HDDs and tested if the temperatures of the CPU were too high
2014-10-11 12:55:49	Yoshi2	nope, they weren't
2014-10-11 12:56:34	@Espyo	how weird
2014-10-11 12:56:39	Yoshi2	I booted ubuntu as a live cd to check the temperatures, and they were fine too, but the CPU fan was still spinning at 4500 RPM which was far too noisy
2014-10-11 12:57:01	Yoshi2	I managed to use a program to lower the fan speed, and it worked
2014-10-11 12:57:13	Yoshi2	the temperatures stayed in the sub-40°C range
2014-10-11 12:57:14	Testyo	-40 °C = -40 °F / 233.15 K
2014-10-11 12:57:53	Yoshi2	so I thought it had to be a bug in the BIOS/motherboard, so I enabled and disabled some fan settings
2014-10-11 12:58:28	Yoshi2	I also replaced the battery on the motherboard
2014-10-11 12:58:52	@Espyo	hmm, makes sense
2014-10-11 12:59:11	Yoshi2	saving the settings and exiting the BIOS while I was on the page with the fan settings might have done it

2014-10-11 13:00:15	Yoshi2	for obvious reasons it is very important to me that the PC doesn't die before I find and order a new notebook
2014-10-11 13:00:36	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-11 13:22:16	@J	my old laptop died like 5 times before I finally got around to getting a new computer
2014-10-11 13:31:03	Yoshi2	J: did your laptop die while in warranty?
2014-10-11 13:36:15	@J	no
2014-10-11 13:36:21	@J	it was (is) quite old
2014-10-11 13:36:40	Yoshi2	I see, how did you get it repaired?
2014-10-11 13:36:40	@J	almost 6 years old now
2014-10-11 13:36:54	@J	well, what died is the hard drive
2014-10-11 13:36:58	Yoshi2	laptops are usually more difficult to repair
2014-10-11 13:37:08	Yoshi2	ah, only the hard drive
2014-10-11 13:37:27	@J	so necessary boot files got lost a few times
2014-10-11 13:37:42	@J	I replaced it, but the new one broke too, very quickly, so it was somehow killing hard drives
2014-10-11 13:37:50	@J	possibly overheating
2014-10-11 13:38:28	@Espyo	oh yeah, that happened a few months ago
2014-10-11 13:43:03	Yoshi2	after a bit of looking around, I found this device: http://www.amazon.de/dp/B009BKUDBQ
2014-10-11 13:43:38	Yoshi2	SSD? Check. 4 GB RAM? Check. Small (and relatively light at ~1.2 kg)? Check. 
2014-10-11 13:44:15	Yoshi2	only downside, the keyboard seems to be a bit small-ish and has no trackpad, only a weird track thingy in the middle of the keyboard
2014-10-11 13:44:30	Yoshi2	and the battery lasts 3 hours on average
2014-10-11 13:47:07	@Espyo	yuck
2014-10-11 13:51:04	Yoshi2	I think if I were to draw a sort of triangle of features that NEED to be on the device, every device I see would be missing at least one of the features

2014-10-11 14:39:23	@J	lots of people like that 'weird track thingy' (usually colloquially 'nipple', though I doubt HW manufacturers call it that)
2014-10-11 14:39:40	Yoshi2	I always find it very weird
2014-10-11 14:40:16	@J	what do you need a mouse for anyway?
2014-10-11 14:41:20	Yoshi2	for real work
2014-10-11 14:41:28	Yoshi2	but on a train a mouse would be unusable anyway
2014-10-11 14:41:41	@Espyo	the trackpad?
2014-10-11 14:41:48	@Espyo	hmmm, nipple
2014-10-11 14:41:49	@J	wait, people do work at university?
2014-10-11 14:41:52	@Espyo	never really heard it like that
2014-10-11 14:42:03	@Espyo	some people are worker-students
2014-10-11 14:42:31	@J	so yeah, all your work is going to be reading stuff and writing stuff
2014-10-11 14:42:42	@J	your keyboard already has a million keys - why not use those?
2014-10-11 14:43:46	Yoshi2	as I'll be away from my current keyboard a lot, I'll need something with a keyboard I can use everywhere I can sit
2014-10-11 14:44:40	@J	wait, I said use the keyboard
2014-10-11 14:45:02	@J	uh, 'your keyboard' there was the keyboard on the new computer
2014-10-11 14:45:10	Yoshi2	I see
2014-10-11 14:46:41	Yoshi2	I'll have to see if 3 hours is enough for work without a socket nearby, or I look for alternatives with more battery
2014-10-11 14:47:22	@J	yeah, that does seem quite low for battery nowadays
2014-10-11 14:47:42	@J	also the stated battery life is usually a lie
2014-10-11 14:47:58	Yoshi2	3 hours is what most people have reported
2014-10-11 14:48:18	Yoshi2	the stated byttery life was probably something like 5 hours
2014-10-11 14:48:22	@J	oh, right
2014-10-11 14:48:27	Yoshi2	and yeah, most of the time it is a lie
2014-10-11 14:48:42	Yoshi2	on my old netbook I never ever reached 9 hours
2014-10-11 14:48:56	Yoshi2	but ~4-6 hours was achievable
2014-10-11 14:49:00	@J	it's probably the battery life if you turn off the screen and don't use it or something
2014-10-11 14:49:57	Yoshi2	I might have to give up my quest for a device with an SSD

2014-10-11 21:41:43	@PikFan	so I speak weird— :|
2014-10-11 21:41:45	@Espyo	I remember when my mum was giving me a talk about maturity
2014-10-11 21:41:54	@Espyo	and she pointed out my voice would change weirdly
2014-10-11 21:42:05	@PikFan	how am I not supposed to worry about it when you say "hah!"
2014-10-11 21:42:24	@PikFan	...oh, as in "hah, rubbish"
2014-10-11 21:42:25	@Espyo	and I jokingly said like "oh, will I be like *squeaky voice*HELLO MUM, HOW *Barry White voice* are you today?"
2014-10-11 21:42:30	@Espyo	and she said "yes, actually"
2014-10-11 21:42:33	@Espyo	and I was like "wut"
2014-10-11 21:42:36	@Espyo	and sure enough, it was true
2014-10-11 21:42:41	@PikFan	oh dear
2014-10-11 21:42:49	@Espyo	when I was in my adolescence, my voice changed between high and low all the time
2014-10-11 21:42:53	@Espyo	so it's normal, don't worry about it
2014-10-11 21:43:09	@PikFan	mm
2014-10-11 21:43:16	@PikFan	people think I'm gay because of my voice

2014-10-11 21:43:37	@Espyo	hm, it should be less relevant now
2014-10-11 21:43:43	@PikFan	yes
2014-10-11 21:43:50	@PikFan	here, people are kind
2014-10-11 21:43:54	Yoshi2	technically, your sexuality has nothing to do with your voice
2014-10-11 21:44:07	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I try to get across to them
2014-10-11 21:44:13	@PikFan	but they're too ignorant to listen
2014-10-11 21:44:23	@PikFan	it's just a stereotype
2014-10-11 21:44:36	@PikFan	that if your voice is weird you're automatically gay or something
2014-10-11 21:45:38	@Espyo	yep

2014-10-11 22:26:01	@J	okay, I did a thing
2014-10-11 22:26:10	@Espyo	not good
2014-10-11 22:26:20	@J	you know how with fsmanage I did all the planning and interface definitions first
2014-10-11 22:26:25	@J	now I did all the documentation
2014-10-11 22:26:45	@J	I often fully document functions and classes before writing them, but I never did it for a whole library before
2014-10-11 22:27:30	@J	I think it will actually help quite a lot, since documenting it made me actually think about how it will look to the library user, and also how everything has to fit together
2014-10-11 22:28:03	@J	it just gets all your thoughts properly in order before you start just writing code
2014-10-11 22:28:50	@Espyo	oh boy
2014-10-11 22:28:51	@Espyo	just code
2014-10-11 22:29:43	@J	yeah, I know what sort of programmer you are
2014-10-11 22:29:56	@J	optimise first, then make it work, then make it usable
2014-10-11 22:30:16	Yoshi2	something about that order seems wrong
2014-10-11 22:30:26	@Espyo	no no no
2014-10-11 22:30:31	@Espyo	I just write code first
2014-10-11 22:30:32	@Espyo	and last
2014-10-11 22:31:03	@J	yeah, those were all stages of writing code
2014-10-11 22:31:28	Yoshi2	how do you optimize something before making sure that it is working?
2014-10-11 22:31:40	@J	I don't know, ask Espyo
2014-10-11 22:32:45	Yoshi2	hm, I want to write code now
2014-10-11 22:32:58	Yoshi2	but it is almost midnight again
2014-10-11 22:33:03	@Espyo	how can you not
2014-10-11 22:33:13	@Espyo	you either check all mobs against all mobs
2014-10-11 22:33:18	@Espyo	or all mobs against all unchecked mobs
2014-10-11 22:33:24	@Espyo	that's an optimization you can do before having working code
2014-10-11 22:33:33	@Espyo	don't come complaining to me when the engine runs at 1fps
2014-10-11 22:33:48	Yoshi2	well
2014-10-11 22:33:57	@Espyo	but anyway, you document, prepare libraries and arrange the modules, and then don't make code because you're bored with
2014-10-11 22:34:01	@Espyo	so hurry up and make code, J
2014-10-11 22:34:01	@J	okay, how did I spell 'interact' as 'interfact' twice?
2014-10-11 22:34:15	@Espyo	interfact is probably a word anyway
2014-10-11 22:34:26	Yoshi2	I guess that works
2014-10-11 22:34:39	@J	but today was documentation day
2014-10-11 22:34:49	@J	I'm just going to look at all that documentation for a while
2014-10-11 22:35:03	@J	just look at all those things
2014-10-11 22:36:23	@PikFan	Interfact: A factoid found on a website that people find as true because they saw it on the internet. 
2014-10-11 22:36:37	@PikFan	oops, forgot quote marks
2014-10-11 22:46:11	Yoshi2	I'll take a nap now, good night

2014-10-11 23:28:10	@PikFan	discovered something
2014-10-11 23:28:16	@PikFan	this might be why stuff is breaking http://mibpaste.com/L2yA4E 
2014-10-11 23:29:25	Mariofan169	mhm
2014-10-11 23:29:27	Mariofan169	hmmmm
2014-10-11 23:29:29	Mariofan169	yep
2014-10-11 23:29:41	Mariofan169	I know some of these words
2014-10-11 23:29:51	@PikFan	@Espyo
2014-10-11 23:29:55	@Espyo	huh
2014-10-11 23:30:05	@Espyo	where in particular?
2014-10-11 23:30:23	@PikFan	that bit is inconsistent with the rest of the code
2014-10-11 23:30:42	@Espyo	uh...
2014-10-11 23:30:46	@Espyo	why didn't you copy-paste everything?
2014-10-11 23:30:48	@PikFan	oh, duh
2014-10-11 23:30:49	@PikFan	sorry
2014-10-11 23:30:59	@PikFan	this part
2014-10-11 23:31:00	@PikFan	|long=<span class=defaultbutton style="font-size:{{{size|smaller}}};background:#eee" title="{{{title|{{{2|}}} button}}}">{{{2|}}}</span>

2014-10-11 23:35:57	@Espyo	all right, I'm completely lost
2014-10-11 23:36:02	@Espyo	what did you do, what is happening, and where
2014-10-11 23:36:11	@PikFan	no no no
2014-10-11 23:36:20	@PikFan	that line I pointed out
2014-10-11 23:36:33	@PikFan	I think it might be part of the reason why stuff is breaking
2014-10-11 23:36:42	@PikFan	it's different from the rest
2014-10-11 23:37:06	@Espyo	how
2014-10-11 23:37:07	@PikFan	because most of the text is like
2014-10-11 23:37:08	@PikFan	|gcn-A=<span title="A button on the GameCube controller">[[File:GCN A.png|{{{size|x16px}}}|link=|A button on the GameCube controller]]</span>

2014-10-11 23:37:17	@Espyo	wait, "long"?
2014-10-11 23:37:18	@Espyo	I never wrote that
2014-10-11 23:37:21	@PikFan	but this is different
2014-10-11 23:37:22	@PikFan	|long=<span class=defaultbutton style="font-size:{{{size|smaller}}};background:#eee" title="{{{title|{{{2|}}} button}}}">{{{2|}}}</span>

2014-10-11 23:37:54	@PikFan	right, you never did write it
2014-10-11 23:38:17	@PikFan	that weird line is in Fanon's button template
2014-10-11 23:38:48	@PikFan	I never really got why there were "default" buttons, but I brought them over anyway
2014-10-11 23:39:05	@PikFan	I tried to turn them into Wii U buttons, but that caused a mess
2014-10-11 23:39:55	@Espyo	why didn't you just copy-paste EVERYTHING from Pikipedia?
2014-10-11 23:40:09	@PikFan	I did :|
2014-10-11 23:41:04	@Espyo	well if that line is there, obviously you didn't
2014-10-11 23:41:04	@PikFan	hmmmm
2014-10-11 23:41:32	@PikFan	no, this is in the pre-c+p version
2014-10-11 23:41:59	@PikFan	...should I just delete it then recreate it with the Pikipedia text?
2014-10-11 23:42:18	@Espyo	then why do you care about an old version?
2014-10-11 23:42:28	@PikFan	gah
2014-10-11 23:42:35	@PikFan	all right, let me explain
2014-10-11 23:42:51	@PikFan	that line appears in Fanon's version
2014-10-11 23:42:57	@Espyo	but WHY does it
2014-10-11 23:43:08	@PikFan	Fanon's version hasn't been fully changed to match Pikipedia's version
2014-10-11 23:43:10	@PikFan	that's just it
2014-10-11 23:43:13	@PikFan	I don't know
2014-10-11 23:43:26	@PikFan	I just mindlessly copied it when I first made it
2014-10-11 23:43:38	@PikFan	along with the rest of the template
2014-10-11 23:46:02	@Espyo	all right, why, then?
2014-10-11 23:46:04	@Espyo	make it fully match
2014-10-11 23:46:07	@Espyo	make everything fully match
2014-10-11 23:46:13	@Espyo	Pikipedia's version is fullproof
2014-10-11 23:46:17	@Espyo	why did you only copy half of it?
2014-10-11 23:46:23	@Espyo	*foolproof
2014-10-11 23:46:55	Meisterbot	because life
2014-10-11 23:47:59	@PikFan	I made [[f:Button icon]]
2014-10-11 23:48:00	Testyo	"Button_icon" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Button_icon
2014-10-11 23:48:10	@PikFan	err, [[f:Template:Button icon]]

2014-10-11 23:48:34	@PikFan	then copied [[Template:Button]] over [[f:Template:Button]]

2014-10-11 23:48:39	@PikFan	and stuff started breaking

2014-10-11 23:49:25	@PikFan	I'm reaaaaally considering deleting then recreating

2014-10-12 12:25:34	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2014-10-12 12:28:18	@Espyo	hey
2014-10-12 12:28:23	@J	.
2014-10-12 12:28:51	Yoshi2	while looking for ways to automate GUI work, I found http://www.sikuli.org/
2014-10-12 12:29:08	Yoshi2	maybe I can use that to quickly create custom soundfonts
2014-10-12 12:31:18	@Espyo	uh? this looks like black magic
2014-10-12 12:31:32	@Espyo	oh, wait
2014-10-12 12:31:37	@Espyo	hmm, it reminds me of...
2014-10-12 12:31:44	@Espyo	uh... AutoHotKey or whatever it was called
2014-10-12 12:31:49	@Espyo	does pretty much the same
2014-10-12 12:31:57	@Espyo	you can create scripts to automate several things
2014-10-12 12:32:22	@Espyo	for instance, every time windows gives that annoying warning about something downloaded from the internet being potentially dangerous, the program and script automatically clicks the "Yes" button for you
2014-10-12 12:32:53	Yoshi2	can you select specific fields in AutoHotKey to fill in data?
2014-10-12 12:34:07	@Espyo	not sure
2014-10-12 12:36:33	Yoshi2	this sikuli thing seems to use image capturing so that it knows what fields look like
2014-10-12 12:38:19	@J	surely there are CLI soundfont creation tools out there
2014-10-12 12:47:10	Yoshi2	CLI tools are probably quite a bit more complicated than the GUI tools
2014-10-12 12:48:38	@J	but intrinsically automatable

2014-10-12 12:52:06	Ford4385	Hey everyone
2014-10-12 12:52:40	Yoshi2	good day
2014-10-12 12:53:19	Yoshi2	J: from a cost-reward perspective, I would rather mess around with GUI automation than try to learn how to use a complicated CLI soundfont editor
2014-10-12 12:56:02	@J	seems silly
2014-10-12 12:56:27	@J	yes, that's all I have to say
2014-10-12 12:56:32	Yoshi2	though if you happen to know a CLI editor, I'd take a look at that
2014-10-12 12:57:00	@Espyo	J doesn't get cost-reward
2014-10-12 12:57:03	@Espyo	it's CLI, or nothing
2014-10-12 12:57:53	Yoshi2	and at this point I'm not even sure if good CLI tools exist
2014-10-12 12:59:06	@J	no, I don't even know what's involved in creating a soundfont
2014-10-12 12:59:27	@Espyo	audio output, for one
2014-10-12 12:59:32	@J	I was just saying that it seems silly to go with a hacky solution before even having a quick look for better options
2014-10-12 12:59:50	@J	audio output?  I thought you would just be creating a file
2014-10-12 13:00:28	Yoshi2	well, one thing I found so far is sfubar
2014-10-12 13:00:30	Yoshi2	http://freepats.zenvoid.org/tools/sfubar-9/README
2014-10-12 13:00:36	Yoshi2	I guess I'll take a look at that
2014-10-12 13:02:14	Yoshi2	of course, if this tool happens to do what I need to create a custom soundfont, I could incorporate into the BMS project
2014-10-12 13:02:20	@J	of course, the ideal mix is to have a GUI to build a config file taken by a CLI program
2014-10-12 13:02:27	Yoshi2	so users could generate Pikmin soundfonts
2014-10-12 13:02:34	@J	for automation + quick start
2014-10-12 13:03:52	Yoshi2	I am not opposed to CLI, I actually like it when programs offer a command line interface
2014-10-12 13:04:27	@Espyo	you need to hear what you're creating to make sure it actually sounds right
2014-10-12 13:04:41	@J	so you play the created file in a media player
2014-10-12 13:05:09	@Espyo	every single time
2014-10-12 13:05:15	@Espyo	or you just press the play button on the GUI
2014-10-12 13:05:25	@Espyo	a mix between CLI and GUI would be great
2014-10-12 13:05:31	@Espyo	but just CLI isn't the way to go here, J
2014-10-12 13:05:43	@Espyo	plus a soundfont is a font of several sounds
2014-10-12 13:05:43	@J	'<command to do the thing>; ffplay out.sf2'
2014-10-12 13:05:52	@Espyo	so you'd have to go do stuff to play each sound specifically
2014-10-12 13:05:57	@Espyo	like a MIDI file set to that soundfont
2014-10-12 13:06:30	@J	mm, I guess?  Like I said, I don't really know what's going on
2014-10-12 13:06:33	Yoshi2	Espyo: playing a midi file with a custom soundfont will be a different beast
2014-10-12 13:06:46	Yoshi2	FluidSynth looks like it can do that
2014-10-12 13:07:04	@J	I just know that pretty much any workflow as simple as pressing a button in a GUI can be just as simple with CLI
2014-10-12 13:07:14	@J	except button -> key

2014-10-12 15:37:50	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-12 15:38:28	Yoshi2	as far as I know, that is the basic convention to keep code from running if you are not executing this file directly
2014-10-12 15:39:12	Yoshi2	so if you import something from this file, the code below that if statement is not executed

2014-10-12 18:12:57	Yoshi2	on a scale from 1 to 10, how not fun is it?
2014-10-12 18:14:07	@J	depends on the program
2014-10-12 18:14:09	@J	usually around -5
2014-10-12 18:14:39	@J	my success rate is significantly less than 50%

2014-10-12 18:16:20	Yoshi2	well
2014-10-12 18:31:28	Yoshi2	I might just switch to linux to try fluidsynth

2014-10-12 18:53:21	@Espyo	J: the game icons are still crapping out
2014-10-12 18:53:51	@Espyo	is it so hard to just create a script that does this right?
2014-10-12 18:54:22	@Espyo	just make any and all calls to {{game icons}} create an invisible element with a class "pikmin3gameicon" or "pikmin2gameicon" or etc.
2014-10-12 18:54:23	Testyo	"game_icons" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game_icons
2014-10-12 18:54:42	@Espyo	and then have a script delete all of them, and add a table with the icons it founds
2014-10-12 18:54:45	@Espyo	*it found
2014-10-12 18:55:09	@Espyo	want me to do it

2014-10-12 18:59:13	Yoshi2	hm, fluidsynth complains about missing presets
2014-10-12 18:59:24	Yoshi2	I guess I'll have to take care of that next week
2014-10-12 18:59:46	@J	it would be better if we only had one on each page, so it works without JS
2014-10-12 19:00:27	@J	did I never do the conflict thing?
2014-10-12 19:00:35	@J	well, food first
2014-10-12 19:00:59	@Espyo	one on each page would complicate everything
2014-10-12 19:01:20	@Espyo	like the P2 treasure template having to have data for the P3 one
2014-10-12 19:01:26	@Espyo	we already have JS as it is, anyway
2014-10-12 19:01:34	@Espyo	I think
2014-10-12 19:01:46	@Espyo	Yoshi2: I can't remember what a preset is, so I can't really help

2014-10-12 19:03:06	Yoshi2	"Presets are normally the final sound-generating structures ready for the user"
2014-10-12 19:03:09	Yoshi2	sounds important
2014-10-12 19:03:41	@J	no, the current JS is optional, just makes it slightly better
2014-10-12 19:04:15	@J	and no, what we'd do is have an option to templates to turn it off, then you manually call {{game icons}}
2014-10-12 19:04:15	Testyo	"game_icons" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game_icons
2014-10-12 19:04:36	@J	or even have it off by default - depends how many pages are affected
2014-10-12 19:08:34	@Espyo	yuck, having to do hard work
2014-10-12 19:08:43	@Espyo	I'm not a fan of the JS either
2014-10-12 19:08:48	@Espyo	but us having to do the hard work...
2014-10-12 19:08:57	@Espyo	it'd be more consistent too, but... where are the volunteers?

2014-10-12 19:13:10	@Espyo	mostly infoboxes
2014-10-12 19:13:25	@J	hmm, maybe Testyo should refuse to link to the same page more than once within a set period of time, or a set number of messages

2014-10-12 19:34:41	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Red%20Bulborb%20Olimar.png all right, how does this look?
2014-10-12 19:34:47	@Espyo	as a candidate to add to the article
2014-10-12 19:34:50	@Espyo	possibly on the infobox
2014-10-12 19:36:35	@J	which article?
2014-10-12 19:36:53	@J	and why are they silhouettes?
2014-10-12 19:37:07	@Espyo	the plan is for each article to have a chart that compares the sizes
2014-10-12 19:37:16	@Espyo	trust me, it's infinite times better to have silhouettes
2014-10-12 19:37:23	@Espyo	for one thing, it's a chart, so simple = better
2014-10-12 19:37:38	@Espyo	secondly, pretty much all size comparison charts have silhouettes
2014-10-12 19:37:43	@Espyo	third, most textures break anyway
2014-10-12 19:37:52	@Espyo	like, the game only has one mature Bulborb model, and it applies different textures
2014-10-12 19:38:06	@Espyo	and I don't want to wizard my way into having a well-looking Red Bulborb model
2014-10-12 19:38:15	@Espyo	these are the models taken directly from the game and aligned on Sketchup
2014-10-12 19:38:56	@J	well, so long as you're not comparing DRB to RB or something
2014-10-12 19:39:09	@Espyo	meh, no need
2014-10-12 19:39:12	@Espyo	comparing to the leader is enough
2014-10-12 19:39:16	@Espyo	and also to the average human
2014-10-12 19:39:21	@Espyo	(in different images)
2014-10-12 19:39:36	@J	how are you generating these anyway?
2014-10-12 19:39:54	@Espyo	<Espyo> these are the models taken directly from the game and aligned on Sketchup
2014-10-12 19:40:10	@Espyo	the game has the models inside BMD files
2014-10-12 19:40:15	@Espyo	BMDView2 can export this to 3DS
2014-10-12 19:40:25	@Espyo	I just import them on Sketch Up, align them, and take a screenshot
2014-10-12 19:40:33	@Espyo	then I turn the whole thing black and white, and it's ready
2014-10-12 19:40:35	@J	hmm, okay
2014-10-12 19:41:06	@J	you've got to work out a way to script this
2014-10-12 19:41:18	@Espyo	probably not
2014-10-12 19:41:30	@Espyo	I'll probably have to take the long way out for this one

2014-10-14 22:55:37	PikFan	at that point in the game, anyway
2014-10-14 22:56:00	PikFan	I'll probably go through and clean that up
2014-10-14 22:56:12	PikFan	when I get all fruit pictures
2014-10-14 22:57:01	PikFan	...which I've made little progress on
2014-10-14 22:57:12	PikFan	need to finish that up; this shouldn't take three weeks
2014-10-14 22:57:19	PikFan	but lazy
2014-10-14 22:57:23	PikFan	anyway
2014-10-14 22:59:35	PikFan	next time Aero gets on, tell him to leave the fruit articles to me
2014-10-14 22:59:41	PikFan	Espyo?
2014-10-14 23:00:30	@J	well, turns out the new Dustforce isn't on Linux yet
2014-10-14 23:00:43	@J	so I will be sad
2014-10-14 23:00:47	PikFan	hm
2014-10-14 23:00:47	@J	hopefully only until tomorrow
2014-10-14 23:02:00	@Espyo	hi
2014-10-14 23:02:40	@Espyo	well, if Pikmin other than winged can carry them
2014-10-14 23:02:42	@Espyo	then let that be
2014-10-14 23:02:55	@Espyo	he said he wants the fruit articles for him
2014-10-14 23:03:21	PikFan	I still need to add the images, though
2014-10-14 23:04:07	@Espyo	you can anyway
2014-10-14 23:04:47	PikFan	besides, any mistakes Aero makes will probably be fixed up
2014-10-14 23:04:56	PikFan	*fixed up by me
2014-10-14 23:05:01	PikFan	not sure why I left that out
2014-10-14 23:05:16	PikFan	hmm
2014-10-14 23:05:27	PikFan	then we have to tackle enemies, then areas...
2014-10-14 23:06:06	PikFan	I'm considering which parts of each area to take an image of
2014-10-14 23:06:43	@Espyo	any relevant point
2014-10-14 23:06:47	@Espyo	that can be described
2014-10-14 23:06:51	@Espyo	check the P1 area shots I took
2014-10-14 23:10:02	PikFan	it's just that the P3 areas are so... /huge/
2014-10-14 23:10:16	PikFan	easily twice the size of P1+2 areas
2014-10-14 23:11:03	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-10-14 23:11:04	@Espyo	but still
2014-10-14 23:11:08	@Espyo	just take loads
2014-10-14 23:11:11	@Espyo	and keep the relevant ones
2014-10-14 23:11:15	@Espyo	and the rest are in categories
2014-10-14 23:11:39	@Espyo	I think we have like [[Category:Awakening Wood images]]

2014-10-15 15:33:13	Yoshi2	well, my notebook arrived
2014-10-15 15:33:25	Yoshi2	but it turns out that it is actually an italian one
2014-10-15 15:39:33	@Espyo	nice, I was gonna ask
2014-10-15 15:39:36	@Espyo	uh...
2014-10-15 15:39:40	@Espyo	like, the OS is in Italian?
2014-10-15 15:40:26	Yoshi2	both the OS and the physical keyboard layout
2014-10-15 15:40:46	Yoshi2	I managed to make the OS German now, so that is fixed
2014-10-15 15:40:59	Yoshi2	but the keyboard is still a bit troublesome because of Y and Z being switched
2014-10-15 15:42:14	@Espyo	drat
2014-10-15 15:42:20	@Espyo	well, pry the keys off and put them back in
2014-10-15 15:43:31	Yoshi2	not only that
2014-10-15 15:44:00	Yoshi2	the umlauts are missing too
2014-10-15 15:44:08	@Espyo	that's more complicated
2014-10-15 15:44:29	@Espyo	though by setting the keyboard layout, you should still be able to press the key for it
2014-10-15 15:44:40	Yoshi2	and other symbols have slightly different positions on the keyboard
2014-10-15 15:44:58	Yoshi2	yeah, but it becomes a bit of a guess work
2014-10-15 15:46:02	Yoshi2	I could probably buy something to put on the keys so that I know their correct positions
2014-10-15 15:46:06	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-15 15:46:21	Yoshi2	one thing is sure, I am not sending this one back because I can't take any more delays
2014-10-15 15:46:39	Yoshi2	(and there are few other devices that are as good as this one)
2014-10-15 15:46:47	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-15 15:47:01	Yoshi2	amazon probably doesn't have another one of this device in stock
2014-10-15 15:47:59	Yoshi2	I'm currently installing updates \o/
2014-10-15 15:48:18	@Espyo	see you in five hours then :|
2014-10-15 15:48:35	Yoshi2	heh
2014-10-15 15:48:46	Yoshi2	yeah, it takes a long time
2014-10-15 16:17:10	Yoshi2	odd, looks like the update failed
2014-10-15 16:17:54	Yoshi2	at least if that's what "Impossible configurare gli aggiornamenti di Windows" means
2014-10-15 16:18:31	@Espyo	aggiornamenti...
2014-10-15 16:18:33	@Espyo	sounds like ornament
2014-10-15 16:19:04	Yoshi2	apparently that means "updates"
2014-10-15 16:19:17	Yoshi2	"Impossible to configure Windows updates. "
2014-10-15 16:19:19	@Espyo	hm
2014-10-15 16:19:28	Yoshi2	currently it is stuck like that, hopefully it finishes soon
2014-10-15 16:19:43	Yoshi2	otherwise I'll have to get rid of the windows installation and install my own copy of windows
2014-10-15 16:22:35	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-15 16:22:37	@Espyo	good grief
2014-10-15 16:22:43	@Espyo	when will the problems stop?
2014-10-15 16:23:07	Yoshi2	yep
2014-10-15 16:23:26	Yoshi2	it doesn't help that my throat hurts, so I skipped the lecture today to go to the doctor
2014-10-15 16:24:02	Yoshi2	(it was early in the morning)
2014-10-15 16:24:31	@Espyo	nuts
2014-10-15 16:26:21	Yoshi2	won't be able to skip the ones tomorrow though, because that would set me back by a lot
2014-10-15 16:27:25	Yoshi2	I started setting this device up ~4 hours ago
2014-10-15 16:28:03	Yoshi2	I'm afraid it won't be ready for tomorrow if it stays like this :/
2014-10-15 16:28:22	Yoshi2	I might just shut it down to install a clean copy of windows
2014-10-15 16:28:44	@Espyo	yeah, and even that will take time
2014-10-15 16:41:41	Yoshi2	well, I'll start preparing something so I can install Win8 from USB
2014-10-15 16:41:58	@Espyo	yeah, might as well
2014-10-15 16:42:26	Yoshi2	if I am going to shut the device down which could break the OS, I'll have to have a replacement for it

2014-10-15 18:36:10	@Espyo	in school?

2014-10-15 18:36:18	@Espyo	for free?
2014-10-15 18:36:23	@PikFan	yep

2014-10-15 18:41:07	@PikFan	best typo

2014-10-15 18:41:16	@PikFan	yeah
2014-10-15 18:41:17	@Espyo	yeha, it is

2014-10-15 18:41:40	@PikFan	that was back in August
2014-10-15 18:41:46	@Espyo	heh
2014-10-15 18:41:52	@Espyo	and then you realize 4chan is only half-insane
2014-10-15 18:41:57	@PikFan	of all the sites, why 4chan

2014-10-15 18:44:03	@PikFan	it's over 9000

2014-10-15 18:44:11	@Espyo	I really dunno what to do with them
2014-10-15 18:44:19	@Espyo	they're a mess, and one of them's basically the off-camera limbo "glitch"
2014-10-15 18:44:19	@PikFan	hmm, maybe move them to Cave?
2014-10-15 18:44:30	@Espyo	gah, we still need GOOD information about off-camera limboness
2014-10-15 18:44:40	@PikFan	well, I was referring to the one about the cave spawn in corners
2014-10-15 18:44:52	@Espyo	I guess it's a glitch, from the looks of things, you can climb up the hole and fall off
2014-10-15 18:44:58	@Espyo	it makes little sense, though
2014-10-15 18:45:05	@PikFan	ooh, edits to patrol
2014-10-15 18:45:06	@Espyo	looks to me like corner pieces can't have items

2014-10-15 18:46:09	@Espyo	from my understanding, the likes of item_cap_* can contain an item
2014-10-15 18:46:14	@Espyo	an item being a treasure, egg, hole, etc.
2014-10-15 18:46:14	@PikFan	hmm
2014-10-15 18:46:26	@Espyo	and corner pieces (wayl) can't
2014-10-15 18:46:44	@Espyo	unless there's a special unit for zigzagging corridors
2014-10-15 18:46:49	@PikFan	the cave can only spawn in a corridor or corner if there's no alcove
2014-10-15 18:46:52	@Espyo	which there isn't
2014-10-15 18:47:07	@Espyo	that thing in the screenshot is just a bunch of wayl_metals together in a row

2014-10-15 18:47:19	@PikFan	if there's an alcove, the cave defaults to spawning in the alcove
2014-10-15 18:47:22	@Espyo	but there are other "room" units it can go to
2014-10-15 18:47:29	@PikFan	otherwise, it's forced to spawn in a corridor or corner
2014-10-15 18:47:31	@PikFan	OH
2014-10-15 18:47:35	@Espyo	wouldn't add up, but I've seen crazier things
2014-10-15 18:47:36	@PikFan	I remembered something
2014-10-15 18:47:45	@PikFan	okay, so I was playing P2 a couple days ago
2014-10-15 18:47:57	@PikFan	on my purpleless/sprayless/11-day run
2014-10-15 18:48:03	@PikFan	on day 9, in the Perplexing Pool
2014-10-15 18:48:22	@PikFan	I return to the landing site, and there's a random blue pellet directly under the blue onion
2014-10-15 18:48:26	@PikFan	I was like /WHAT/
2014-10-15 18:48:50	@PikFan	it wasn't there when I started the day
2014-10-15 18:49:03	@PikFan	and I didn't issue any Pikmin to carry a blue pellet
2014-10-15 18:49:22	@PikFan	it was a blue 5-pellet
2014-10-15 18:49:51	@Espyo	lolwut
2014-10-15 18:49:53	@Espyo	dammit, this game
2014-10-15 18:50:00	@Espyo	also I need to hurry and leave
2014-10-15 18:50:06	@Espyo	I didn't want to, because the rain is intense, but
2014-10-15 18:50:11	@PikFan	hmm
2014-10-15 18:50:20	@PikFan	grab a coat or umbrella (if you have one)
2014-10-15 18:50:34	@Espyo	eh screw it, I'm already kinda late to the subway
2014-10-15 18:50:41	@Espyo	and still need to update my progress report
2014-10-15 18:50:44	@Espyo	I'll stay ANOTHER 20
2014-10-15 18:50:54	@Espyo	I have an umbrella, but it's dinky
2014-10-15 18:50:57	@PikFan	you're having a perfect day, aren't you
2014-10-15 18:51:04	@Espyo	plus umbrellas and me always had a bad history
2014-10-15 18:51:10	@Espyo	they always break with me for some reason
2014-10-15 18:51:24	@Espyo	meh, it's not bad because if I do an extra 20 minutes today, that's 20 minutes I can leave earlier on friday
2014-10-15 18:51:27	@Espyo	 40 minutes now
2014-10-15 18:51:30	@Espyo	actually, an hour and 20 minutes
2014-10-15 18:51:36	@Espyo	'cause I've been delaying for a bit now to avoid the rain
2014-10-15 18:51:43	@Espyo	so that's a hefty amount of time I can leave earlier friday
2014-10-15 18:51:52	@PikFan	have you opened it inside before?
2014-10-15 18:52:02	@Espyo	yes, to let it dry, why?
2014-10-15 18:53:03	@PikFan	you do know that it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside, right?
2014-10-15 18:54:48	@Espyo	heh, yeah, but that's silly
2014-10-15 18:55:07	@Espyo	it's even WORSE luck to let a wet umbrella stay closed without drying, and let the metal rust
2014-10-15 18:57:59	Yoshi2	I had enough bad luck without having to open an umbrella inside
2014-10-15 18:58:19	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-10-15 18:58:34	Yoshi2	today, for example
2014-10-15 18:58:44	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-10-15 18:58:47	@Espyo	I thought PikFan said that
2014-10-15 18:58:49	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-15 18:58:50	@PikFan	oh dear
2014-10-15 19:05:19	@PikFan	okay, so I've got the new PikCast going
2014-10-15 19:06:48	@PikFan	I can't hear it that great, though
2014-10-15 19:07:03	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-15 19:07:10	@Espyo	and I need to start going
2014-10-15 19:07:16	@Espyo	doesn't look like it's gonna get any weaker
2014-10-15 19:07:19	@Espyo	and I better not stay for THAT long
2014-10-15 19:07:24	@PikFan	no headphones I know of in the classroom
2014-10-15 19:07:24	@PikFan	alright
2014-10-15 19:07:24	@PikFan	may be on later
2014-10-15 19:07:27	@PikFan	early release todat
2014-10-15 19:07:28	@PikFan	*today
2014-10-15 19:07:29	@Espyo	you can totally do extra hours during the week and leave earlier on friday
2014-10-15 19:07:43	@Espyo	but they gave me the bullshit excuse that "I can't be trusted because I'm an intern" when I asked them
2014-10-15 19:07:48	@Espyo	doing it anyway, I don't care
2014-10-15 19:08:00	@Espyo	I was here these extra hours, I'm either getting paid extra, or have the right to leave early

2014-10-15 22:11:40	@Espyo	the PW guys were JUST saying they should change all instances of Bulborb to bolbert
2014-10-15 22:11:40	@J	so, the Dustforce update still isn't out for Linux
2014-10-15 22:11:58	@J	I played the current version
2014-10-15 22:12:06	@J	and now I can't play any more because my hands hurt too much

2014-10-15 22:15:08	@PikFan	it'd be more convenient if they were on IRC

2014-10-15 22:15:25	@PikFan	how come they prefer Skype?
2014-10-15 22:21:17	@Espyo	excuse me?

2014-10-15 22:21:33	@Espyo	skype automatically capitalized the S on its name, when I wrote it on a message

2014-10-16 05:58:35	@PikFan	yeah, he's busy playing Smash 4
2014-10-16 05:58:43	@PikFan	talking to Pikmin Wiki people
2014-10-16 05:58:58	@PikFan	and he's adding a new template documentation style over at Pikipedia
2014-10-16 05:59:10	@PikFan	so he's got a pretty full plate

2014-10-16 06:00:57	@PikFan	Peach Bulborb wrote the last two stories
2014-10-16 06:01:02	@PikFan	now I'm writing a new one
2014-10-16 06:01:25	@PikFan	the entry is nothing but a prologue
2014-10-16 06:01:32	@PikFan	but the chapters are much, much longer
2014-10-16 06:01:51	@PikFan	...I may have to break them up into bits to fit on the main page
2014-10-16 06:03:20	Dry_Paratroopa	Hmm...
2014-10-16 06:03:36	Dry_Paratroopa	Okay, I must ask, why do so many Pikmin ideas involve Cerebus Syndrome?
2014-10-16 06:03:58	@PikFan	Cerebus Syndrome?
2014-10-16 06:04:20	@PikFan	is that your diagnosis of their lacking in quality?
2014-10-16 06:04:39	Dry_Paratroopa	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome
2014-10-16 06:04:56	Dry_Paratroopa	Yes, they're lacking in quality, but I was referring to how they're all dark
2014-10-16 06:05:22	Dry_Paratroopa	I don't see why Pikmin has any need to be rated T
2014-10-16 06:05:35	@PikFan	oh
2014-10-16 06:05:48	@PikFan	ask the creators
2014-10-16 06:06:18	@PikFan	I think part of it has to do with making it more realistic
2014-10-16 06:06:38	@PikFan	but you do have a point; it does have its limits
2014-10-16 06:09:01	Dry_Paratroopa	I wouldn't say it's more realistic
2014-10-16 06:09:21	Dry_Paratroopa	Off the top of my head, there's a story where the main villain is called the Darkfreeze and is from another dimension
2014-10-16 06:10:59	@PikFan	PikSpore, I think

2014-10-16 06:11:45	@PikFan	just part of their individuality, I guess

2014-10-16 06:15:36	Dry_Paratroopa	Mind if I ask you why yours is dark?
2014-10-16 06:24:24	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-10-16 06:24:30	@PikFan	oh
2014-10-16 06:24:55	@PikFan	personally I don't think it's dark
2014-10-16 06:25:11	@PikFan	it's just a couple of greedy villians
2014-10-16 06:25:29	Dry_Paratroopa	Perhaps, but what about Destruction of Time?
2014-10-16 06:25:32	@PikFan	they don't really commit crimes
2014-10-16 06:25:38	@PikFan	oh that
2014-10-16 06:26:13	@PikFan	it isn't dark if you think lightly about it, but I get your gist
2014-10-16 06:26:21	Dry_Paratroopa	Connection of the Worlds is still rated T for blood and scary images, by the way
2014-10-16 06:26:33	@PikFan	an entire universe, faced with impending doom
2014-10-16 06:26:40	@PikFan	yeah, but so what
2014-10-16 06:27:16	@PikFan	"scary images" aren't really that scary, just more... action-intense, I suppose
2014-10-16 06:27:22	@PikFan	I need to rework the rating
2014-10-16 06:27:28	@PikFan	it isn't really a T game
2014-10-16 06:27:41	@PikFan	more of a E10+ game
2014-10-16 06:27:53	@PikFan	and so I'll have to fix the boxart accordinglu
2014-10-16 06:27:56	@PikFan	*accordingly
2014-10-16 06:29:14	@PikFan	Pikmin could be really violent, if you think about it
2014-10-16 06:29:56	@PikFan	you know in Pikmin 2, when you throw Purple Pikmin at enemies, and their bodies distort in weird ways for a half second?
2014-10-16 06:30:12	Dry_Paratroopa	No
2014-10-16 06:30:26	@PikFan	oh? hmm
2014-10-16 06:30:38	Dry_Paratroopa	I haven't played Pikmin 2 in years
2014-10-16 06:30:50	@PikFan	well, throwing Purples at enemies... like a bulborb, for example
2014-10-16 06:31:04	Dry_Paratroopa	I know they home in
2014-10-16 06:31:06	@PikFan	their bodies will briefly be scaled in different directions
2014-10-16 06:31:39	@PikFan	anyway, if Pikmin was violent, like bloody and stuff, there would be blood splattering everywhere, body parts falling out
2014-10-16 06:32:04	@PikFan	and in the case of Pikmin squishing dwarf bulborbs, their bodies would basically explode
2014-10-16 06:32:10	@PikFan	but enough of that
2014-10-16 06:32:57	@PikFan	that is definitely dark
2014-10-16 06:33:16	@PikFan	I don't know a single fan game that is that intense
2014-10-16 06:33:51	@PikFan	besides, the fan games are for fun
2014-10-16 06:33:53	Dry_Paratroopa	It's not just about gore, it's also how Olimar's somehow able to stop an otherworldly being with the power to destroy the universe
2014-10-16 06:34:16	Dry_Paratroopa	He's not Link, wielding the Master Sword. He's a space traveler the size of a quarter.
2014-10-16 06:34:24	@PikFan	well yeah
2014-10-16 06:34:41	@PikFan	which game are you referring to? DoT?
2014-10-16 06:34:50	@PikFan	(Destruction of Time)
2014-10-16 06:35:08	Dry_Paratroopa	Quite a few of the games on here
2014-10-16 06:35:38	@PikFan	well, Olimar isn't by himself
2014-10-16 06:35:50	@PikFan	he's got some sort of power to aid him
2014-10-16 06:36:20	@PikFan	otherwise, it's inconceivable how he could stop such a threat by himself
2014-10-16 06:36:21	Dry_Paratroopa	Okay, he's joined by 100 creatures who can't even avoid getting eaten by an obvious approaching predator without guidance
2014-10-16 06:36:34	Dry_Paratroopa	Who are smaller than him, no less
2014-10-16 06:36:40	@PikFan	right, I know that
2014-10-16 06:37:22	@PikFan	but by 'power' I was referring to whatever plot mechanic is in that game is used to defeat the final boss
2014-10-16 06:37:29	@PikFan	besides, these are fan games
2014-10-16 06:37:41	@PikFan	they're just users' ideas
2014-10-16 06:38:08	@PikFan	generally they don't take into account these kinds of things
2014-10-16 06:38:16	@PikFan	as do most other users
2014-10-16 06:38:25	@PikFan	you notice these things, and that's fine
2014-10-16 06:38:37	Dry_Paratroopa	Yeah, most of our users are probably prepubescent
2014-10-16 06:38:57	@PikFan	all I'm saying is that they don't have that intricate detail
2014-10-16 06:39:24	@PikFan	this is just a fun little hang out spot where we share our ideas and have fun
2014-10-16 06:39:50	@PikFan	we don't really set our expectations high
2014-10-16 06:40:12	@PikFan	as long as it's legible, gets the point across, and has some form of organization, that's all that matters
2014-10-16 06:41:46	@PikFan	noting these inconsistencies is good though, in case if we want to go back and correct them for whatever reason
2014-10-16 06:42:14	Dry_Paratroopa	Inconsistencies?
2014-10-16 06:43:25	Dry_Paratroopa	I was ranting about a lot of fangames go beyond suspension of disbelief

2014-10-16 19:38:32	@Espyo	it's not italian any more, is it?
2014-10-16 19:39:10	Yoshi2	I fixed the system language
2014-10-16 19:39:13	Yoshi2	somewhat
2014-10-16 19:39:19	@Espyo	somewhat
2014-10-16 19:39:26	@Espyo	reassuring
2014-10-16 19:39:26	Yoshi2	sometimes it still displays italian text, but only in rare cases

2014-10-16 20:45:32	PikFan	okay so
2014-10-16 20:46:04	PikFan	I'm in my science classroom and people are playing Brawl
2014-10-16 20:46:08	@Espyo	nice
2014-10-16 20:46:10	PikFan	it's interesting
2014-10-16 20:46:22	PikFan	it's really intense
2014-10-16 20:46:36	@Espyo	not as much as Melee
2014-10-16 20:46:41	@Espyo	Brawl is like 3 times less intense than Melee
2014-10-16 20:47:33	PikFan	my friend says that Brawl is more intense than Melee because Brawl is more developed
2014-10-16 20:47:38	@Espyo	it's less
2014-10-16 20:47:49	@Espyo	competitively, at least
2014-10-16 20:47:55	@Espyo	additions in Brawl are like 3
2014-10-16 20:47:59	@Espyo	removals from Meele are like 12
2014-10-16 20:48:25	PikFan	*Melee
2014-10-16 20:49:15	Yoshi2	I wouldn't mind Brawl too much, but it has that stupid tripping
2014-10-16 20:49:29	@Espyo	no, *Brawl
2014-10-16 20:49:34	@Espyo	it does, yeah
2014-10-16 20:49:48	@Espyo	I meant that Brawl added like 3 new things from Melee
2014-10-16 20:49:50	@Espyo	tripping...
2014-10-16 20:49:56	@Espyo	uh
2014-10-16 20:50:00	@Espyo	well, probably two more things
2014-10-16 20:50:09	@Espyo	but removed a bunch of important competitive aspects
2014-10-16 20:50:20	@Espyo	no directional air-dodging, which meant no wavedash, a perfect tool for spacing
2014-10-16 20:50:32	@Espyo	no L-cancelling, which allowed you to follow up quickly after landing from an areal attack
2014-10-16 20:50:34	@Espyo	etc.
2014-10-16 20:53:19	@Espyo	so I wrote a quick greasemonkey script that automatically detects problems on a page's source
2014-10-16 20:53:28	@Espyo	stuff like linking to [[Pikmin]] instead of the game or family

2014-10-16 21:16:39	@Espyo	yes
2014-10-16 21:16:42	@Espyo	also what's flashy?
2014-10-16 21:16:59	@Espyo	anyway, you know how we cat some templates with [[Category:Stuff|{{PAGENAME}}]]?
2014-10-16 21:17:00	Testyo	"Category:Stuff|{{PAGENAME}}" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Stuff|{{PAGENAME}}
2014-10-16 21:17:14	@Espyo	I think the reason for that was that {{PAGENAME}} returns the name of the page without the namespace
2014-10-16 21:17:15	Testyo	"PAGENAME" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:PAGENAME
2014-10-16 21:17:17	@J	[21:01:46] @Espyo a recent Firefox update made introduced a glitch where portions of the screen flashy in weird colors in the rhythm of a textbox cursor
2014-10-16 21:17:32	@J	yeah, that's the reason
2014-10-16 21:17:38	@Espyo	meaning templates would get categorized without all of them being on T
2014-10-16 21:17:38	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-16 21:17:39	@Espyo	except
2014-10-16 21:17:43	@Espyo	that is absolutely not the case
2014-10-16 21:17:57	@Espyo	I've removed that on like 40+ template pages
2014-10-16 21:18:04	@Espyo	and so far, saw absolutely no template categorized incorrectly on T
2014-10-16 21:18:13	@J	perhaps it got fixed in MW
2014-10-16 21:18:21	@Espyo	so... either a mediawiki update fixed it at some point (ages ago from the looks of it), or there's another reason
2014-10-16 21:18:24	@Espyo	can you think of anything else?
2014-10-16 21:18:25	@J	I know for sure it used to happen
2014-10-16 21:18:34	@Espyo	yeah, I'm pretty sure I remember something like that too
2014-10-16 21:18:54	@J	but if we can remove those, then that's great
2014-10-16 21:18:57	@Espyo	that Firefox glitch happened at work too, I think
2014-10-16 21:19:01	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-16 21:19:09	@Espyo	I'm going through all templates and improving the documentation
2014-10-16 21:19:12	@Espyo	like {{Box}}
2014-10-16 21:19:13	Testyo	"Box" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Box
2014-10-16 21:19:27	@Espyo	so in the process, I'll remove the PAGENAME bit on the cats
2014-10-16 21:19:36	@Espyo	thoughts on the documentation?
2014-10-16 21:19:45	@Espyo	I was just sick and tired of seeing one template explain its parameters in a list of bullet points
2014-10-16 21:19:49	@Espyo	another explaining it in text
2014-10-16 21:20:09	@Espyo	and another explaining it in a <pre> where you're meant to copy+paste and replace the parameters when adding to an article

2014-10-16 21:20:27	@Espyo	hopefully this can allow us to quickly go to a template article and understand what the parameters are
2014-10-16 21:20:46	@Espyo	instead of having to understand what crazy format this template page uses just to understand what the "unnamed123=" parameter does
2014-10-16 21:20:56	@J	I don't think the styles being different makes it any slower to read
2014-10-16 21:21:02	@Espyo	sure it does
2014-10-16 21:21:03	@J	they're all reasonably readable
2014-10-16 21:21:06	@Espyo	they are
2014-10-16 21:21:09	@Espyo	but consistency
2014-10-16 21:21:22	@Espyo	plus if the parameters are explained in text, it's a bit more bothersome if you're searching for info on a particular one
2014-10-16 21:21:26	@Espyo	a table is much easier to read
2014-10-16 21:21:33	@Espyo	also added examples, they're always helpful
2014-10-16 21:21:37	@J	not if it only takes positional parameters
2014-10-16 21:21:57	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-10-16 21:22:10	@J	meh, never mind
2014-10-16 21:22:19	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-10-16 21:22:28	@J	I'm not arguing against consistency, just saying I don't think it made it harder to read
2014-10-16 21:22:40	@Espyo	I don't really agree it makes it harder either
2014-10-16 21:22:49	@Espyo	if anything, just takes slightly longer to find the info you want
2014-10-16 21:22:50	@Espyo	is all
2014-10-16 21:23:13	@Espyo	you just want to know what a parameter is for, and you have to read through the text
2014-10-16 21:23:25	@Espyo	another thing, I made a quick script to parse a page source while editing
2014-10-16 21:23:32	@Espyo	and report back problems like unitalicized game names and such
2014-10-16 21:23:36	@Espyo	problem: regex really doesn't like me

2014-10-16 21:24:14	@J	the 'name' column in the table is misleading
2014-10-16 21:24:23	@Espyo	I know, I wanted to go with "short description"
2014-10-16 21:24:30	@Espyo	but that itself is too long
2014-10-16 21:24:39	@J	Purpose
2014-10-16 21:24:43	@Espyo	it's just "description of the parameter without having to have a long sentence about it"
2014-10-16 21:24:46	@Espyo	hmm, that works, I guess
2014-10-16 21:24:53	@J	then just omit it entirely for named parameters
2014-10-16 21:25:13	@Espyo	I decided not to, for consistency
2014-10-16 21:25:14	@J	I don't think we really do templates with mixes of positional/named parameters anyway
2014-10-16 21:25:16	@Espyo	but it doesn't make sense, does it
2014-10-16 21:25:23	@Espyo	we do {{button}}
2014-10-16 21:25:24	Testyo	"button" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:button
2014-10-16 21:27:08	@J	and then the names in ==Template== are slightly different
2014-10-16 21:27:15	@J	(in terms of casing/word separation)
2014-10-16 21:27:29	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-10-16 21:27:31	@Espyo	gotta get rid of it
2014-10-16 21:27:35	@Espyo	dinner, brb
2014-10-16 21:27:46	@Espyo	but tell me what you think about the column order on the parameter table, because I'm not really feeling it
2014-10-16 21:28:10	@J	maybe default last
2014-10-16 21:33:58	@J	you need ?!<\'\' in your first part
2014-10-16 21:34:25	@J	don't need to escape ' in // in JS anyway

2014-10-16 22:01:32	@Espyo	but it gives a match for "''Pikmin 2", and no match for "''Pikmin 2''"
2014-10-16 22:01:55	@Espyo	it's just that it also doesn't match "Pikmin 2''", where it should
2014-10-16 22:02:03	@Espyo	but if it doesn't work... then bloody hell
2014-10-16 22:02:11	@Espyo	<J> you need ?!<\'\' in your first part
2014-10-16 22:02:14	@Espyo	where did that < come from?
2014-10-16 22:02:27	@Espyo	is that the real negation syntax? because I can't find any page that's consistent on what the syntax is
2014-10-16 22:06:02	@J	no, < means look behind, the ! is the negation
2014-10-16 22:07:04	@J	I would just search without the '' parts, then check manually for the '' around it
2014-10-16 22:07:25	@Espyo	yeah, guess I'll have to
2014-10-16 22:07:38	@Espyo	other regexes are screwing up too, but I think they're all negations
2014-10-16 22:07:46	@Espyo	so I'll have to take the long way
2014-10-16 22:08:43	@J	negations work, but only lookahead, not lookbehind

2014-10-17 17:52:56	@Espyo	afternoon
2014-10-17 17:56:48	Yoshi2	until I somehow fix my PC, I guess my dual monitor setup will be like a docking station
2014-10-17 17:57:58	Yoshi2	at least I think this notebook has hdmi and something that looks like vga output
2014-10-17 17:59:19	@Espyo	it should have hdmi
2014-10-17 18:04:25	Yoshi2	it definitely has hdmi, and something that (I think) looks like vga
2014-10-17 18:04:32	Yoshi2	three rows with 5 pins
2014-10-17 18:06:29	@Espyo	seems about right
2014-10-17 18:12:29	Yoshi2	I am suprised, this notebook has a correctly isolated audio output jack
2014-10-17 18:13:12	Yoshi2	every other notebook I had had horrible audio output that would make weird noise depending on what I do
2014-10-17 18:14:03	@Espyo	ugh, that sucks
2014-10-17 18:14:08	@Espyo	hmm, is it just one jack?
2014-10-17 18:14:18	@Espyo	one of these newfangled stereojacks
2014-10-17 18:14:31	@Espyo	if you want a microphone and headphones, you need a headset that has a jack combining the two
2014-10-17 18:15:58	Yoshi2	that might be the case
2014-10-17 18:16:13	Yoshi2	I see no audio jack for a microphone
2014-10-17 18:22:30	@Espyo	let me tell you, it's horrible
2014-10-17 18:22:39	@Espyo	it's very hard to find headsets that combine the two
2014-10-17 18:22:53	@Espyo	and you can buy an splitter... but it won't do anything
2014-10-17 18:24:31	Yoshi2	nothing you can do about that, I guess
2014-10-17 18:25:11	Yoshi2	I don't use headsets very much, so that is not too much of a problem
2014-10-17 18:34:10	Yoshi2	I wonder if I saved the Pikmin BMS files when I copied over the project
2014-10-17 18:34:44	Yoshi2	yup, got them
2014-10-17 18:34:51	@Espyo	phew
2014-10-17 18:38:08	Yoshi2	setting up a git client and an development environment shouldn't be too difficult
2014-10-17 18:40:24	@Espyo	hopefully
2014-10-17 19:09:28	@Espyo	wow
2014-10-17 19:09:36	@Espyo	I'm guessing you could change your windows language easily
2014-10-17 19:09:45	@Espyo	because it's likely a Professional Edition
2014-10-17 19:09:55	@Espyo	you can't change it in other versions by default
2014-10-17 19:10:00	@Espyo	you can do some alternate steps to get it to work

2014-10-17 19:10:30	@Espyo	if I had to continue any more one second, I would very likely smash that laptop with a vase out of desperation

2014-10-17 19:11:00	@Espyo	never before have I seen such convoluted steps to install something so simple
2014-10-17 19:11:09	@Espyo	it's not real, period
2014-10-17 19:12:42	Yoshi2	they made installing languages very simple in Win8, I think
2014-10-17 19:16:33	Yoshi2	it also looks like this notebook has the standard Win8 version installed, not a professional version
2014-10-17 19:28:24	@J	sad continued lack of new Dustforce
2014-10-17 19:47:09	@Espyo	"continued lack"
2014-10-17 19:47:11	@Espyo	almost sounds wrong
2014-10-17 19:49:17	Yoshi2	I think it is grammatically correct
2014-10-17 19:49:21	@Espyo	it is
2014-10-17 19:49:35	Yoshi2	oddly worded, maybe
2014-10-17 19:49:36	@Espyo	but lack + continued
2014-10-17 19:49:38	@Espyo	sounds paradoxical

2014-10-17 20:28:12	@Espyo	so it's just Firefox being a goof

2014-10-17 21:30:07	@J	it's always the runs you mess up at the start that go right

2014-10-18 00:06:02	@Espyo	well, that's bad, 'cause mine explores a bit of dark tones sometimes
2014-10-18 00:06:05	@Espyo	the final tone is dark
2014-10-18 00:06:15	@PikFan	'mine
2014-10-18 00:06:15	@Espyo	and some minor descriptions on some things border into the darker too
2014-10-18 00:06:20	@PikFan	*'mine'?
2014-10-18 00:06:26	@Espyo	but the rest of the ambience of the game is like any other
2014-10-18 00:06:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-18 00:06:28	@PikFan	you're making a fangame?

2014-10-18 00:07:09	@PikFan	heh
2014-10-18 00:07:11	@Espyo	but I plan on making a fan game so I can implement it on the engine
2014-10-18 00:07:16	@PikFan	right, right
2014-10-18 00:07:21	@Espyo	so that the engine uses at LEAST one game
2014-10-18 00:07:26	@Espyo	so it doesn't go to waste until the end of time
2014-10-18 00:07:30	@Espyo	anyway, gotta go

2014-10-18 13:16:19	@J	I managed a 1:02.2 with a lower rank where none of the mistakes should've affected speed, so that's my target

2014-10-18 13:22:16	Ford4385	I'm so glad the pages for the caves are accurate (enough to atleast let you survive anyways)
2014-10-18 13:23:24	@Espyo	I still need to go through them again
2014-10-18 13:23:29	@Espyo	once we learn how the game files work for the caves
2014-10-18 13:23:37	@Espyo	because they have some weird numbers on them that don't make much sense
2014-10-18 13:23:51	@Espyo	so the count of enemies, plants, etc. might be wrong in some places
2014-10-18 13:24:33	Meisterbot	so off topic

2014-10-18 13:28:20	@Espyo	you can also try the Wistful Wild; if you go into the final boss, and kill it with petrification, you win 10 sprays

2014-10-18 13:30:21	@Espyo	nah, but you do have to know some Japanese tricks if you want to get an accurate translation
2014-10-18 13:30:34	@Espyo	like sometimes a D at the start of a word (syllable?) can be replaced with a T, and vice-versa

2014-10-18 13:33:14	@Espyo	I still plan on adding a little question mark to the top-right of Japanese text
2014-10-18 13:33:50	@Espyo	that links to a page explaining Japanese charsets (like Wikipedia does), and also a disclaimer that these are machine translated, but unless the translation seems to be really accurate, it's not added on the wiki

2014-10-18 18:55:48	@Espyo	which images?
2014-10-18 18:55:59	@PikFan	the images I uploaded
2014-10-18 18:56:24	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-18 18:56:34	@Espyo	the how to section should have the location of the fruit on the map
2014-10-18 18:56:34	@Espyo	same as P2
2014-10-18 18:56:38	@Espyo	but until then... just put yours
2014-10-18 18:59:05	@Espyo	GAAAAH ARACHNODES
2014-10-18 18:59:06	@Espyo	ASDKJASDHASD
2014-10-18 18:59:12	@Espyo	they have more HP than a Red Bulborb
2014-10-18 18:59:23	@Espyo	and if you're throwing yellows, and it reaches low enough for rocks to reach
2014-10-18 18:59:25	@Espyo	you can forget it
2014-10-18 18:59:38	@Espyo	it's impossible to press the L button to switch to rocks, because you're blocked from doing so if you're throwing
2014-10-18 18:59:49	@Espyo	so you either pause the throws and switch, and then your Pikmin die because you weren't attacking
2014-10-18 18:59:56	@Espyo	or you mash L like a mad man in hopes it switches
2014-10-18 19:00:06	@Espyo	and it ends up switching after 80 L presses, long after the creature ate a Pikmin
2014-10-18 19:00:06	Testyo	80 l = 21.136 gl / 140.784 pints
2014-10-18 19:00:32	@PikFan	yes, we all hate Arachnodes
2014-10-18 19:00:40	@PikFan	vile creatures
2014-10-18 19:01:19	@PikFan	are you using the GamePad to play?
2014-10-18 19:01:37	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-18 19:01:52	@PikFan	eeh...
2014-10-18 19:01:53	@Espyo	can't be assed to have to pick up my Wii Remote and nunchuck every time

2014-10-18 19:03:09	@PikFan	is your electric bill that bad

2014-10-18 20:47:18	Dry_Paratroopa	Because almost all of its contributors are young people who don't think about organization
2014-10-18 20:47:30	Dry_Paratroopa	So I've been hoping to clean it up
2014-10-18 20:47:34	@Espyo	yes
2014-10-18 20:47:43	@Espyo	uh
2014-10-18 20:47:43	Dry_Paratroopa	Not change the content, but make it uncluttered

2014-10-18 20:48:20	@Espyo	I guess it's justifiable — Britanny saw them in action in a previous day
2014-10-18 20:48:23	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-10-18 20:48:27	@PikFan	is it "they don't seem to be very effective" or something like that?
2014-10-18 20:49:21	@PikFan	alright, so
2014-10-18 20:49:31	@PikFan	Dry_Paratroopa wants to clean up the wiki, as stated before
2014-10-18 20:49:45	Dry_Paratroopa	The thing that we're looking for your input on, Espyo, is the proposed format inside of the horizontal lines. That content is what would show on the main page for the project and would be how we do the Pikmin articles.
2014-10-18 20:49:48	@PikFan	firstly, he wants to focus on the Pikmin articles
2014-10-18 20:49:54	@Espyo	which horizontal lines?

2014-10-18 20:51:58	@PikFan	there will be a page about which games share its explosive resistance attributes

2014-10-18 20:53:18	@PikFan	so it just splits up the Pikmin page into different pages, each one focusing on a different attribute
2014-10-18 20:53:31	@PikFan	the main page will probably end up as a disambig page

2014-10-18 21:19:13	@Espyo	all right, back
2014-10-18 21:19:16	@Espyo	I don't like that idea
2014-10-18 21:19:22	@Espyo	because they rarely share attributes
2014-10-18 21:19:32	@Espyo	cyan Pikmin are probably the most common ones
2014-10-18 21:19:39	@Espyo	and they have loads of things different in each game
2014-10-18 21:19:50	@Espyo	their ability is almost always the same: ice resistance
2014-10-18 21:20:05	Dry_Paratroopa	Yes
2014-10-18 21:20:08	@Espyo	but their attack power, the places they appear in, whether they freeze enemies or not when swallowed, etc.
2014-10-18 21:20:11	@Espyo	that's all different from game to game
2014-10-18 21:20:18	Dry_Paratroopa	Those sorts of things won't have their own pages
2014-10-18 21:20:18	@Espyo	you'd need tens of subpages
2014-10-18 21:20:25	Dry_Paratroopa	It's only their main attributes
2014-10-18 21:20:26	@Espyo	it's best to just have a cyan Pikmin page
2014-10-18 21:20:30	@Espyo	and one section per game
2014-10-18 21:22:07	Dry_Paratroopa	That's what we have, and it's not working out very well
2014-10-18 21:22:31	Dry_Paratroopa	The Cyan Pikmin page is, as far as I know, the only semi-organized Pikmin page we have
2014-10-18 21:24:38	@Espyo	[[f:Cyan_Pikmin]]

2014-10-18 21:25:01	@Espyo	I have a different idea
2014-10-18 21:25:15	@Espyo	the article, in this case Cyan Pikmin
2014-10-18 21:25:22	@Espyo	and then a section with all the games it appears in
2014-10-18 21:25:25	@Espyo	and then one section per game
2014-10-18 21:25:28	@Espyo	no more top-level sections
2014-10-18 21:25:33	@Espyo	(except maybe See also and etc.)
2014-10-18 21:25:48	@Espyo	on each game section, the editor may have whichever sections they want
2014-10-18 21:26:04	@Espyo	abilities, where to find, special traits, areas where they need to be used...
2014-10-18 21:26:09	Dry_Paratroopa	Again, that's basically what we have now
2014-10-18 21:26:13	@Espyo	it's not

2014-10-18 21:26:28	@Espyo	right now we have a section for appearance, one for attributes, one for areas, etc.
2014-10-18 21:26:33	@Espyo	and THEN within those are the ones for each game
2014-10-18 21:26:37	@Espyo	I'm saying the opposite
2014-10-18 21:26:42	@Espyo	at least judging from cyan Pikmin
2014-10-18 21:26:43	Dry_Paratroopa	Only on the Cyan Pikmin page
2014-10-18 21:26:45	@Espyo	oh
2014-10-18 21:26:50	Dry_Paratroopa	Every other page is not like that
2014-10-18 21:26:52	@Espyo	lemme check orange then

2014-10-18 21:27:12	@Espyo	well, I don't see what's wrong with that
2014-10-18 21:27:19	@Espyo	besides the incredibly wrong organization
2014-10-18 21:27:24	@Espyo	but the general layout is fine
2014-10-18 21:27:27	@Espyo	one section per game
2014-10-18 21:27:32	@Espyo	it also helps with the infoboxes
2014-10-18 21:27:44	@Espyo	only problems I see are infoboxes being absolutely mangled behind recognition
2014-10-18 21:27:54	@Espyo	some sections having only one paragraph and huge images
2014-10-18 21:28:06	@Espyo	images pushing infoboxes pushing images
2014-10-18 21:30:59	Dry_Paratroopa	Yeah, having more than one page helps alleviate that
2014-10-18 21:31:29	@Espyo	it can be done without
2014-10-18 21:35:57	@Espyo	final boss, no deaths!
2014-10-18 21:36:01	@Espyo	finally...
2014-10-18 21:36:27	@Espyo	let me try a prototype of the Orange Pikmin page that doesn't break everything
2014-10-18 21:37:08	@Espyo	actually never mind, that's freaking huge
2014-10-18 21:37:31	Dry_Paratroopa	Oh yeah, that's the other problem with having a single page
2014-10-18 21:37:49	@Espyo	what subpages do you expect to have, then?
2014-10-18 21:38:10	Dry_Paratroopa	That's explained in the proposal
2014-10-18 21:38:19	Dry_Paratroopa	It's also explained earlier in the discussion
2014-10-18 21:39:01	Dry_Paratroopa	Any defining trait that has more than one game with that trait gets a page
2014-10-18 21:39:11	@Espyo	define "trait"
2014-10-18 21:39:17	@Espyo	ability/resistance?
2014-10-18 21:39:29	Dry_Paratroopa	For the most part, yes
2014-10-18 21:39:48	@Espyo	is there any Pikmin type that has multiple resistances and abilities?
2014-10-18 21:39:54	@Espyo	besides orange: explosions or lava
2014-10-18 21:40:03	@Espyo	cyan is pretty much always ice
2014-10-18 21:40:06	@Espyo	green is like acid
2014-10-18 21:40:13	@Espyo	and everything else... is exactly the same everywhere
2014-10-18 21:40:17	@Espyo	same with enemies
2014-10-18 21:40:31	Dry_Paratroopa	Black varies a lot
2014-10-18 21:40:37	@Espyo	I almost don't think it's a good idea to have one page with multiple content to begin with
2014-10-18 21:40:41	@Espyo	*with multiple games

2014-10-18 21:47:40	Dry_Paratroopa	I don't have to imagine that, either, because that's what the Wiki is.
2014-10-18 21:47:49	@Espyo	probably a subpage with "in other games" that just has the info for games that don't have much info
2014-10-18 21:49:03	Dry_Paratroopa	Most games don't have much info
2014-10-18 21:49:41	@Espyo	I'm not sure then
2014-10-18 21:51:23	Dry_Paratroopa	There's a reason why everyone agreed on the change we did. It's far more organized than the free-for-all clusterf*** that we have now and is rather easy to follow.
2014-10-18 21:52:08	@Espyo	well, give it a try on a few pages
2014-10-18 21:52:16	@Espyo	both a popular page, like cyan
2014-10-18 21:52:23	@Espyo	a semi-popular one
2014-10-18 21:52:30	@Espyo	and one that only two or three games are related to
2014-10-18 21:52:34	@Espyo	we'll see how it goes

2014-10-18 21:54:59	Peach_Bulborb	So, what is should we do about the format
2014-10-18 21:55:50	Dry_Paratroopa	We're going to try it on a few pages to see if it works.
2014-10-18 21:56:08	@Espyo	hey PB
2014-10-18 21:56:11	@Espyo	I thought you didn't like IRC
2014-10-18 21:56:19	Dry_Paratroopa	I invited him to come join us
2014-10-18 21:56:33	Peach_Bulborb	I stay off it when I can help it, but this is important and most efficient.
2014-10-18 21:57:46	Dry_Paratroopa	Should we make Sandbox pages with it, or try editing the real thing?
2014-10-18 21:59:20	Peach_Bulborb	A sandbox would be best, as we might clutter the real page while working it out. I think we should make a "Project Clean Up Sandbox" and use that for each page. That way we can make changes and suggestions as necessary to get the final product.

2014-10-18 22:00:14	Dry_Paratroopa	So it would be /Project Clean Up/Orange Sandbox or something like that?
2014-10-18 22:01:11	Peach_Bulborb	More like /Project Clean Up Sandbox, just one to reduce unnecessary creating and deleting.
2014-10-18 22:02:15	Dry_Paratroopa	Okay

2014-10-18 22:06:35	Peach_Bulborb	For efficiency, maybe we could make 2 or 3 and then an "approval" section at the bottom. Once we all put our names down, then that change is officially implemented and something new goes on that page. In this way, we could work on two or three projects at once instead of just one, which is far too slow.

2014-10-19 13:36:16	@Espyo	right, so, clashing
2014-10-19 13:36:32	@Espyo	yeah, "clash" obviously means it's a parameter you set to avoid clashes
2014-10-19 13:36:35	@Espyo	but /what/ clashes
2014-10-19 13:36:44	@Espyo	templates, infoboxes can clash with loads of things
2014-10-19 13:36:49	@Espyo	positioning, game icons...
2014-10-19 13:36:59	@Espyo	categorization

2014-10-19 13:37:09	@Espyo	it's like calling it "fix=y"
2014-10-19 13:40:10	@J	it's just 'you have more than one of the things that can clash'

2014-10-19 16:39:33	@J	just like I said
2014-10-19 16:41:23	@Espyo	you never said that
2014-10-19 16:42:08	@J	I said it would probably be the case, and that there's no point doing it because of that
2014-10-19 16:42:10	@J	...I think
2014-10-19 16:42:51	@Espyo	but we checked both games and manuals
2014-10-19 16:42:57	@Espyo	it wasn't until Pikmin 3 that everything was adding up
2014-10-19 16:43:02	@Espyo	in that case, let's just go for consistency
2014-10-19 16:43:09	@Espyo	if not even the games can make sense, why bother
2014-10-19 16:43:20	@Espyo	let's just use upper everywhere — least fixing required

2014-10-19 21:40:51	@PikFan	wrong revision: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_forums&diff=prev&oldid=73258

2014-10-19 21:41:17	@Espyo	oh, so the reason is "no reason"?
2014-10-19 21:41:29	@PikFan	:|
2014-10-19 21:41:35	@Espyo	"it's better" isn't a reason :|
2014-10-19 21:41:53	@PikFan	it shouldn't really be a mainspace page
2014-10-19 21:41:53	@Espyo	the Pikipedia: namespace is for wiki projects
2014-10-19 21:41:59	@Espyo	and stuff directly related to the wiki
2014-10-19 21:42:06	@Espyo	this is related to the fandom ([[Category:Fandom]])
2014-10-19 21:42:07	Testyo	"Category:Fandom" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Fandom
2014-10-19 21:42:10	@Espyo	same as speedruns and such
2014-10-19 21:42:27	@Espyo	it's not in-game content, but neither is Pikmin in other games, merchandise, music albums, etc.
2014-10-19 21:42:50	@PikFan	this is different, though
2014-10-19 21:42:53	@PikFan	these are forums
2014-10-19 21:42:58	@Espyo	so?
2014-10-19 21:43:12	@PikFan	a page listing links to forums doesn't really belong on the mainspace
2014-10-19 21:43:25	@Espyo	a page listing merchandise shouldn't either, then
2014-10-19 21:44:30	@PikFan	merchandise isn't user generated
2014-10-19 21:44:32	@PikFan	forums are
2014-10-19 21:44:51	@Espyo	I don't see how the fact that it's user-generated means it shouldn't be namespace
2014-10-19 21:44:54	@Espyo	speedruns are user-generated
2014-10-19 21:45:18	@PikFan	because it's communication
2014-10-19 21:45:29	@Espyo	I really don't see how that matters
2014-10-19 21:45:42	@PikFan	bah, fine
2014-10-19 21:45:54	@Espyo	well, explain to me how it matters
2014-10-19 21:46:03	@Espyo	it's a little different from other articles, sure
2014-10-19 21:46:10	@Espyo	but it doesn't warrant a different namespace
2014-10-19 21:46:17	@Espyo	and even if it did, it'd be an insane idea
2014-10-19 21:46:20	@Espyo	making a namespace for it
2014-10-19 21:46:25	@Espyo	yeah, because we can't really have it on Pikipedia:
2014-10-19 21:46:31	@Espyo	that's for Pikipedia-related business

2014-10-19 21:54:44	@J	should probably add the Pikmin Subreddit

2014-10-19 22:03:13	@Espyo	or something like that

2014-10-21 23:27:22	@J	what?
2014-10-21 23:27:45	@Espyo	what at the edit, or at me pining you?
2014-10-21 23:28:12	@J	the thing where you wanted me or something
2014-10-21 23:28:21	@J	not sure pining is a word you want to use there
2014-10-21 23:30:39	@Espyo	let's not say I wrote that
2014-10-21 23:30:44	@Espyo	I meant pinging, and I meant highlighting, even
2014-10-21 23:30:53	@Espyo	anyway, this regex isn't working and I can't tell why
2014-10-21 23:31:30	@Espyo	it should detect text after a section, on the same line
2014-10-21 23:31:32	@Espyo	like
2014-10-21 23:31:40	@Espyo	==Section== I'm text that shouldn't be here
2014-10-21 23:32:09	@Espyo	 /^\=+.+\=+.+$/
2014-10-21 23:36:13	@J	I don't see why that wouldn't work, but you shouldn't need to escape =
2014-10-21 23:36:23	@Espyo	better safe than sorry
2014-10-21 23:36:57	@J	well, I got a match against your example here
2014-10-21 23:37:03	@Espyo	oh
2014-10-21 23:37:11	@Espyo	the problem is it matches stuff it shouldn't
2014-10-21 23:37:13	@J	however, it won't match '== thing == stuff='
2014-10-21 23:37:16	@Espyo	==This matches too==
2014-10-21 23:37:22	@J	oh
2014-10-21 23:37:24	@Espyo	yeah, it won't, but that's a stretch
2014-10-21 23:37:29	@J	that's because the .+ is matching the last =
2014-10-21 23:37:35	@Espyo	uh, shoot
2014-10-21 23:37:38	@Espyo	dammit regex
2014-10-21 23:38:03	@J	so what you want is ^=+[^=]+=+[^=].*
2014-10-21 23:38:06	@J	possibly
2014-10-21 23:38:31	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-21 23:38:43	@J	or you can make one of the + be greedy by adding ? after it (I think)
2014-10-21 23:39:40	@J	wait, no, that wouldn't help
2014-10-21 23:39:52	@J	yeah, just what I said first
2014-10-21 23:40:32	@J	and now I should go, so bye

2014-10-22 19:28:55	@Espyo	if Yoshi2 enables caps lock, pressing 1 does !
2014-10-22 19:29:03	@J	that's weird

2014-10-22 20:16:28	@Espyo	pfffft
2014-10-22 20:16:37	@Espyo	we thought it could have to do with the keyboard layout, maybe
2014-10-22 20:16:44	@Espyo	oh, it happened on #Pikipedia
2014-10-22 20:17:51	@Espyo	meanwhile
2014-10-22 20:17:52	@Espyo	^=+[^=]+=+[^=]+.*$
2014-10-22 20:17:55	@Espyo	this is still matching
2014-10-22 20:18:00	@Espyo	==Section name==
2014-10-22 20:18:03	@Espyo	whereas it should only match
2014-10-22 20:18:09	@Espyo	==Section name==Bad text
2014-10-22 20:18:15	@Espyo	it matches both
2014-10-22 20:18:39	@Espyo	flags are case insensitivity, multi-line (otherwise ^ and $ don't work), and global search, because javascript
2014-10-22 20:21:23	Yoshi2	Espyo: do I smell regex?
2014-10-22 20:24:27	Yoshi2	that does look like regex
2014-10-22 20:27:56	Yoshi2	the .* might be very greedy
2014-10-22 20:30:07	Yoshi2	I am a bit confused about the [^=] though
2014-10-22 20:33:27	@Espyo	that's regex
2014-10-22 20:33:31	@Espyo	worked without the .* too
2014-10-22 20:33:39	@Espyo	[^=] means a character that isn't =
2014-10-22 20:34:38	Yoshi2	ahh, I see
2014-10-22 20:36:12	Yoshi2	so we have one or many of =, one or many of [any character except =], one or many of =, one or many of [any except =], end of line
2014-10-22 20:36:20	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-22 20:36:31	Yoshi2	and it matches both of your strings?
2014-10-22 20:36:31	@Espyo	except it's not working...
2014-10-22 20:36:36	@Espyo	yeah, it's matching both
2014-10-22 20:36:48	@Espyo	maybe it detects eol as a character...?
2014-10-22 20:37:43	Yoshi2	maybe
2014-10-22 20:37:54	Yoshi2	or any character that isn't being displayed
2014-10-22 20:39:37	Yoshi2	I tested both of your strings in python, and the first one definitely shouldn't match unless there are some invisible characters of sorts
2014-10-22 20:40:29	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-22 20:41:18	Yoshi2	maybe there is a way to exclude control characters
2014-10-22 20:41:24	@Espyo	maybe
2014-10-22 20:41:49	Yoshi2	that won't be pretty though
2014-10-22 20:42:46	Yoshi2	the alternative is to only include a specific set of visible characters, although that could be troublesome too
2014-10-22 20:42:55	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-22 20:51:04	@J	wait, what's #Pikipedia?
2014-10-22 20:51:43	@Espyo	depends on who you ask
2014-10-22 20:51:51	@Espyo	for a HexChat user, it's a channel about Pikmin
2014-10-22 20:52:06	@Espyo	for some other clients, it's a non-registered channel
2014-10-22 20:53:48	@J	yeah, it's a multi-line thing
2014-10-22 20:53:59	@J	not sure how multi-line is meant to be working for you
2014-10-22 20:54:24	@Espyo	but
2014-10-22 20:54:26	@J	you could just do ($|\n) at the end
2014-10-22 20:54:28	@Espyo	I need multilie
2014-10-22 20:54:30	@Espyo	*multiline
2014-10-22 20:58:56	@Espyo	hmmmmmmmm
2014-10-22 20:59:03	@J	oh, $ is matching both new lines and the end, so make the .* non-greedy like Yoshi2 said
2014-10-22 20:59:10	@J	is it .*?
2014-10-22 20:59:12	@J	uh
2014-10-22 20:59:12	@J	...
2014-10-22 20:59:16	@J	is it '.*?'?
2014-10-22 20:59:25	@Espyo	question marks?
2014-10-22 20:59:40	@Espyo	but anyway
2014-10-22 20:59:43	@Espyo	 /^=+[^=]+=+[^=]{10,}$/igm
2014-10-22 20:59:48	@Espyo	this doesn't match a normal section
2014-10-22 20:59:56	@Espyo	but matches a section with, guess what, loads of characters after
2014-10-22 21:00:03	@Espyo	so yeah, it has to be detecting newline characters
2014-10-22 21:00:20	@Espyo	oh, uh
2014-10-22 21:00:25	@Espyo	question marks are "one or none", I remember now
2014-10-22 21:00:36	@Espyo	that will very likely blow up, that ".*?"
2014-10-22 21:02:27	@J	no, the modifier there is '*?'
2014-10-22 21:02:33	@J	it's not the same as (.*)?
2014-10-22 21:02:45	@Espyo	I don't
2014-10-22 21:02:48	@Espyo	what the hell is that then?
2014-10-22 21:04:24	Yoshi2	an ? after * makes the * consume the least amount of characters needed to match the regex
2014-10-22 21:05:05	@Espyo	I never knew that
2014-10-22 21:05:43	Yoshi2	same with +
2014-10-22 21:05:51	@Espyo	 /^=+[^=]+=+[^=].*?$/igm
2014-10-22 21:05:55	@Espyo	still matches ==Bla==
2014-10-22 21:06:30	Yoshi2	but that is not the problem here, I think
2014-10-22 21:06:36	@Espyo	I'm a bit lost
2014-10-22 21:06:41	@Espyo	sorry, haven't said yet, but I got fired today
2014-10-22 21:06:46	@Espyo	reason is still not clear
2014-10-22 21:06:55	@Espyo	maybe a combination of things
2014-10-22 21:07:05	@Espyo	times I was on Pikipedia at work, even if I wasn't procrastinating
2014-10-22 21:07:16	@Espyo	combined with being told that I can control my work hours freely, provided I do 40 hours a week
2014-10-22 21:07:28	@Espyo	but after asking somebody if I could do it, them going berserk and thinking I'm a slacker
2014-10-22 21:07:29	@Espyo	...somehow
2014-10-22 21:07:36	@Espyo	if I still do 40 hours a week, what difference does it make?
2014-10-22 21:07:41	@Espyo	but anyway, might be a combination of all of that
2014-10-22 21:07:45	@Espyo	so I'm a bit distant right now
2014-10-22 21:07:59	@Espyo	plus I'm also discussing the ban of some creep on another channel, and I've got dinner
2014-10-22 21:08:03	@Espyo	so I'm really lost with that regex
2014-10-22 21:08:11	@J	ouch, that didn't last long
2014-10-22 21:08:19	@J	good luck finding somewhere else
2014-10-22 21:08:42	@J	so \n seems to match both $ and [^$]
2014-10-22 21:08:46	@J	which is crazy
2014-10-22 21:09:05	@J	for that reason I don't think this is doable without including \n
2014-10-22 21:10:17	@J	/(^|[\n\r])=+[^=\n\r]+=+[^=\n\r][^\n\r]*($|[\n\r])/i
2014-10-22 21:10:24	@J	I don't like that
2014-10-22 21:10:26	Yoshi2	regex is almost voodoo magic, so I think it isn't too uncommon to become lost, especially when you have a lot of data to be matched
2014-10-22 21:20:55	Yoshi2	I'll be off now, good night
2014-10-22 21:21:28	@J	bye

2014-10-22 21:39:04	@Espyo	I don't like that either

2014-10-22 22:55:34	PikFan	why is he in caps lock

2014-10-22 22:55:52	PikFan	WAIT SO
2014-10-22 22:56:02	PikFan	IF TODAY IS CAPS LOCK DAY WHY AREN'T YOU IN CAPS LOCK
2014-10-22 22:58:26	@Espyo	meh, different things on my mind
2014-10-22 22:58:26	@Espyo	got fired today
2014-10-22 22:58:49	PikFan	:o
2014-10-22 22:58:52	PikFan	what
2014-10-22 22:58:53	PikFan	why
2014-10-22 22:59:11	@Espyo	they didn't give a real reason
2014-10-22 22:59:19	@Espyo	but after gathering the facts, I came to the conclusion
2014-10-22 22:59:28	@Espyo	if you need to say or ask anything, do it to your supervisor, never to your boss
2014-10-22 22:59:43	@Espyo	my project has a skype group with everybody involved in it, including the boss
2014-10-22 23:00:04	@Espyo	throughout this job, I was always told shifting hours during the week was perfectly normal, and anybody can do it
2014-10-22 23:00:13	@Espyo	like +1 hour each day before friday, and on friday, leaving 4 hours early
2014-10-22 23:00:19	@Espyo	I figured I should ask if it's ok
2014-10-22 23:00:24	@Espyo	but I did so on the skype group
2014-10-22 23:00:30	@Espyo	and the boss angrily answered no
2014-10-22 23:00:36	@Espyo	that was the beginning of a spiral of madness
2014-10-22 23:00:55	@Espyo	whereas if I were to ask my superior, he'd either say sure, or he'd say no, but nothing else would go bad from there on out
2014-10-22 23:01:26	PikFan	I don't understand why it's bad to ask your boss a question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2014-10-22 23:01:37	PikFan	err, random huge space
2014-10-22 23:01:42	PikFan	anyway
2014-10-22 23:02:05	PikFan	seems like your boss is a jerk
2014-10-22 23:02:39	@Espyo	yeah, but it is
2014-10-22 23:02:46	@Espyo	every bosses are jerks, from what other people are telling me
2014-10-22 23:02:59	@Espyo	oh, that really is only spaces
2014-10-22 23:03:00	@Espyo	eesh
2014-10-22 23:03:05	@Espyo	how did that happen?
2014-10-22 23:03:25	PikFan	must've been been pressing on the space key and I didn't know it
2014-10-22 23:04:03	PikFan	ah, if only there were nice bosses
2014-10-22 23:05:10	@Espyo	my mum told me she once had a nice boss
2014-10-22 23:05:16	@Espyo	but he only controlled one fourth of the company
2014-10-22 23:05:16	PikFan	hmm
2014-10-22 23:05:21	@Espyo	and when the other 3 decided to go greedy
2014-10-22 23:05:22	PikFan	...oh
2014-10-22 23:05:24	@Espyo	he quit, because he didn't want that
2014-10-22 23:05:31	PikFan	corporate greed
2014-10-22 23:05:36	@Espyo	so yeah, don't really get why we as a race have yet to develop kindness

2014-10-22 23:06:05	@Espyo	you'd think it'd be the glue that would bind us all through mankind's history
2014-10-22 23:06:09	@Espyo	but nope, every man for himself
2014-10-22 23:06:19	PikFan	it states in the Article Policy that you take ownership of your content
2014-10-22 23:06:22	@J	my boss is fine
2014-10-22 23:06:31	@Espyo	adoption, huh?
2014-10-22 23:06:33	@J	and the boss of some people I work with is great
2014-10-22 23:06:35	PikFan	yeah, unfortunately
2014-10-22 23:06:40	@Espyo	yeah, I thought my boss was fine too
2014-10-22 23:06:41	PikFan	no, not adoption even
2014-10-22 23:06:45	@Espyo	and I was always told they would be fine
2014-10-22 23:06:47	PikFan	just... taking
2014-10-22 23:06:48	@Espyo	until I got stabbed in the back
2014-10-22 23:06:51	@Espyo	no doubt some can be
2014-10-22 23:06:59	@Espyo	and you're already working there for a while, so nasty surprise time is over
2014-10-22 23:07:02	@Espyo	but I wasn't so lucky
2014-10-22 23:07:18	@J	mhm
2014-10-22 23:07:27	PikFan	how do you get money now?
2014-10-22 23:07:29	PikFan	if at all
2014-10-22 23:07:32	@Espyo	another job
2014-10-22 23:07:38	PikFan	yeah...
2014-10-22 23:07:39	@Espyo	it's not THAT hard to find a job, considering loads of factors
2014-10-22 23:07:45	PikFan	weren't you an intern?
2014-10-22 23:07:46	@Espyo	Portugal is pretty much a desert for jobs
2014-10-22 23:07:54	@Espyo	but hey, at least I'm an engineer, #1 demand
2014-10-22 23:07:56	@Espyo	I was
2014-10-22 23:08:09	@Espyo	I can still add that to my CV, provided they don't find out I was fired for no reason
2014-10-22 23:08:12	@Espyo	the official reason is "no reason"
2014-10-22 23:08:15	@Espyo	says so on the slip
2014-10-22 23:08:19	@Espyo	not those exact words, but eh
2014-10-22 23:08:34	@Espyo	but if an employer sees you got fired from a previous place, they likely won't accept you
2014-10-22 23:08:45	@Espyo	so I have to be careful to point out this work experience, without bringing to attention me getting fired
2014-10-22 23:09:00	@Espyo	and I couldn't justify myself saying it was baseless and unjust
2014-10-22 23:09:05	@Espyo	they won't care
2014-10-22 23:09:11	@Espyo	but I'll get a job some other way
2014-10-22 23:09:16	@Espyo	and my parents can afford me being here just fine
2014-10-22 23:09:32	@Espyo	they could afford me being here while studying, and back then I was spending 1000€ a year for tuitions
2014-10-22 23:09:32	Testyo	1000 € = £ 855.2  / $ 1356.4 
2014-10-22 23:09:38	@Espyo	so now I'm even less of a burden
2014-10-22 23:09:42	@Espyo	but I need a job for my own life anyway
2014-10-22 23:09:42	PikFan	hmm
2014-10-22 23:09:47	PikFan	right, right
2014-10-22 23:10:00	@Espyo	well, hopefully next job, I'll actually code
2014-10-22 23:10:08	@Espyo	instead of doing tests on somebody's horrible, HORRIBLE source code
2014-10-22 23:11:05	PikFan	yeah

2014-10-22 23:11:41	PikFan	what do you mean, informal
2014-10-22 23:11:52	@Espyo	yeah, good luck with that, kiddo
2014-10-22 23:12:08	@Espyo	if you want the backend to be informal, bad news, it always was
2014-10-22 23:12:20	@Espyo	if you want the content to be informal, you better stop editing wikis altogether, or go on fanon instead
2014-10-22 23:12:34	PikFan	community = informal
2014-10-22 23:12:38	PikFan	content =/= informal
2014-10-22 23:12:49	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-22 23:13:17	PikFan	unless you're some kid who doesn't care about anything and just barfs up random sentence
2014-10-22 23:13:23	PikFan	*sentences
2014-10-22 23:13:48	PikFan	oh, so I actually have a use for my iPad:

2014-10-23 20:05:39	@J	hi
2014-10-23 20:06:31	@Espyo	hi
2014-10-23 20:06:34	@Espyo	all right, two things
2014-10-23 20:06:50	@Espyo	a) would it make sense to categorize stuff like {{!}} under [[Category:Meta templates]]?
2014-10-23 20:06:51	Testyo	"Category:Meta_templates" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Meta_templates
2014-10-23 20:07:05	@Espyo	the word "meta" gets thrown a lot these days, and I'm starting to fear it's actually not the right word for it at all
2014-10-23 20:15:56	@J	mm...
2014-10-23 20:16:02	@J	more like 'utility'
2014-10-23 20:16:32	@J	it's templates for use mainly in complex templates, not templates that somehow refer to or generate templates
2014-10-23 20:16:34	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-23 20:16:39	@Espyo	exactly
2014-10-23 20:16:45	@J	also that was one thing
2014-10-23 20:16:47	@Espyo	that'll be it then
2014-10-23 20:16:56	@Espyo	sick and tired of having the templates splattered around [[Category:Templates]]
2014-10-23 20:16:57	Testyo	"Category:Templates" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Templates
2014-10-23 20:17:01	@Espyo	second thing, where's my Nobel prize
2014-10-23 20:17:12	@J	cat:templates only exists to make them not uncategorised
2014-10-23 20:17:27	@J	why do you deserve any sort of prize?
2014-10-23 20:18:05	@Espyo	{{infobox multi}}
2014-10-23 20:18:09	@Espyo	this cures infobox cancer
2014-10-23 20:18:11	Testyo	"infobox_multi" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:infobox_multi
2014-10-23 20:18:56	@Espyo	you know how, currently, our enemy infoboxes have the global seeds value, the P1-specific seeds value, the P2-specific and P3-specific
2014-10-23 20:19:00	@Espyo	and it's a complete mess?
2014-10-23 20:19:06	@Espyo	and most of them didn't even have P3?
2014-10-23 20:19:09	@Espyo	this template fixes it all
2014-10-23 20:19:14	@J	I already saw that
2014-10-23 20:19:43	@J	the name is...a thing
2014-10-23 20:20:05	@Espyo	all ears for alternatives
2014-10-23 20:20:49	@J	'per-game field' or something
2014-10-23 20:22:09	@Espyo	blech
2014-10-23 20:22:51	@J	it's better to have a name that doesn't sound wonderful than a vague name
2014-10-23 20:23:16	@J	it should really indicate it's for a thing where the choices are the games
2014-10-23 20:23:41	@Espyo	game param splitter?
2014-10-23 20:23:43	@J	the 'infobox' part doesn't actually matter since you could use it elsewhere if you really wanted
2014-10-23 20:23:47	@Espyo	or param splitter
2014-10-23 20:24:05	@Espyo	yeah, but it generates table rows, so it's pretty much infobox only, unless you really stretch your imagination
2014-10-23 20:24:22	@J	oh, okay
2014-10-23 20:24:29	@J	why not make it generate just the value?
2014-10-23 20:24:40	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-23 20:25:09	@Espyo	oh, because this way, you don't have to check on the infobox if the global has a value, the P1-exclusive one has a value, the P2-exclusive has, and the P3-exclusive has
2014-10-23 20:25:13	@Espyo	in which case, no row
2014-10-23 20:25:57	@J	wait, I don't get it
2014-10-23 20:26:15	@J	if you get a value for every game, you don't show the row?
2014-10-23 20:27:28	@J	wouldn't you only want to not show a row if there's no default and no parameters given?
2014-10-23 20:27:31	@J	but yeah, okay
2014-10-23 20:27:39	@Espyo	no no
2014-10-23 20:27:47	@Espyo	you need either a value that's global
2014-10-23 20:27:52	@Espyo	or any one of the game-specific values
2014-10-23 20:28:03	@Espyo	<J> wouldn't you only want to not show a row if there's no default and no parameters given?
2014-10-23 20:28:04	@J	yeah, that's not what you said before
2014-10-23 20:28:08	@Espyo	yeah, this is what happens
2014-10-23 20:28:09	@Espyo	ugh
2014-10-23 20:28:13	@Espyo	I'm not sure what I said
2014-10-23 20:29:35	@J	'field' kind of works, then - that's what you've got, a name and a value
2014-10-23 20:30:08	@Espyo	yeah, but I want to point out how its job is to act differently depending on the games' values
2014-10-23 20:31:04	@J	hey, that doesn't mean you don't want to call it a field
2014-10-23 20:31:23	@Espyo	I know, but it doesn't mean I want to call it just a field
2014-10-23 20:32:34	@J	oh, I wasn't saying just call it 'field' 
2014-10-23 20:32:42	@J	I was just saying the term can go in there
2014-10-23 20:32:43	@Espyo	oh, ok
2014-10-23 20:32:45	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-23 20:32:53	@Espyo	per-game field?
2014-10-23 20:32:54	@J	so what happens if you don't specify anything for one game?
2014-10-23 20:32:59	@J	...
2014-10-23 20:33:01	@J	[20:20:49] @J 'per-game field' or something
2014-10-23 20:33:18	@Espyo	well then
2014-10-23 20:33:25	@Espyo	I guess that just proves it's a good choice, huh
2014-10-23 20:33:31	@Espyo	hehe, I didn't really let it sink in
2014-10-23 20:33:40	@Espyo	if you don't, it only shows the other games

2014-10-24 18:46:39	Spark	hey espyo, quick question; in my game, im currently using a list for each type of thing to render; i.e. a list of sprites, a list of lines of text, etc. they're all global variables. is there a better way to do that, or is what i'm doing okay?
2014-10-24 18:47:56	Espyo	depends on who you ask
2014-10-24 18:47:59	Espyo	I'm a fan of global variables
2014-10-24 18:48:04	Espyo	but everyone else hates them for their insane reasons
2014-10-24 18:48:23	Espyo	if you see that it makes more sense to have those lists inside a class, go for it
2014-10-24 18:48:28	Espyo	but if not, leave them as globals
2014-10-24 18:48:32	Spark	alright, thanks :)
2014-10-24 18:48:38	Espyo	no prob
2014-10-24 18:48:47	Espyo	oh, and decide quickly before J comes and tries to convert you
2014-10-24 18:49:00	Spark	haha okay
2014-10-24 18:49:00	Espyo	sticking crazy thoughts into your head about how globals are worse than BSoDs

2014-10-24 19:01:12	@J	kill them all now
2014-10-24 19:02:09	@J	in our codebase at work we recently discovered some conditionally defined mutable globals that are changed in multiple files
2014-10-24 19:02:12	@J	almost died
2014-10-24 19:17:01	Spark	should i use dynamically allocated memory for enemies
2014-10-24 19:17:12	Spark	or is that stupid
2014-10-24 19:18:03	@J	as opposed to what, fixing the number of enemies you can have and allocating it all on startup?
2014-10-24 19:18:13	Spark	idk really
2014-10-24 19:18:37	Spark	the thing is, it seems to be that when i try to make a lot of enemies at once, it crashes
2014-10-24 19:19:10	@J	that means your code is wrong, not that you're allocating memory at the wrong time
2014-10-24 19:19:25	Spark	the debugger said something about malloc and calloc
2014-10-24 19:19:43	Spark	so idk what else it could be
2014-10-24 19:20:08	@J	I mean, it's that you're calling them wrongly rather than calling them at the wrong time
2014-10-24 19:20:18	@J	the 'something' there is probably the important part
2014-10-24 19:21:12	Spark	it doesnt really give me any other information :P but i'll assume that since youre more knowledgeable than me, youre right and i did something wrong
2014-10-24 19:21:30	@J	not so much I'm right as the compiler is right
2014-10-24 19:21:36	@J	I know hardly any C++
2014-10-24 19:22:30	Spark	oh its a sigsegv apparently
2014-10-24 19:22:31	Spark	wonderful
2014-10-24 19:22:41	Spark	those are a nightmare to deal with i've heard
2014-10-24 19:23:00	@J	and that's why I know hardly any C++
2014-10-24 19:23:12	Spark	what language do you use?
2014-10-24 19:23:31	@J	at home, Python; at work, JavaScript (as Node.js)
2014-10-24 19:23:44	@J	plus lots of others as necessary
2014-10-24 19:23:58	@J	like bits of C, Ruby, Bash, Scala
2014-10-24 19:24:46	Spark	why would you use C but not C++? isnt C++ literally just improved C?
2014-10-24 19:24:53	Spark	just out of curiousity :P
2014-10-24 19:25:03	@J	C is like C++ without all the bloat
2014-10-24 19:25:14	@J	which makes it very simple, so you can easily know the whole language
2014-10-24 19:25:20	@J	I don't use it much, though
2014-10-24 19:25:20	Spark	ah
2014-10-24 19:25:36	@J	just when I want speed, or lightweight dependencies

2014-10-24 22:54:33	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2014-10-24 22:59:59	Spark	okay so 
2014-10-24 23:00:21	Spark	i'm making a tower defense game and i want the buildings to each have a specific cost
2014-10-24 23:00:29	Spark	should i use static members for that
2014-10-24 23:00:44	Spark	ive never really used them before so i dont know if that's a good way to do it
2014-10-24 23:13:49	@Espyo	hmm

2014-10-24 23:14:05	PikFan	.
2014-10-24 23:14:11	@Espyo	the thing about statics is that they pretty much belong to a class instead of an instance
2014-10-24 23:14:11	Spark	heyo
2014-10-24 23:14:12	@Espyo	hey PikFan
2014-10-24 23:14:26	PikFan	misread statics as statistics
2014-10-24 23:14:39	Spark	well espy, that's the thing - i want all towers of a certain class to be the same price
2014-10-24 23:14:46	Spark	i mean i could set the variable in the constructor too
2014-10-24 23:14:47	@Espyo	oh, all right
2014-10-24 23:14:50	@Espyo	that's a good idea, then
2014-10-24 23:15:00	Spark	setting it in the constructor, or using statics?
2014-10-24 23:15:40	@Espyo	either one
2014-10-24 23:15:47	Spark	okay, thanks :3
2014-10-24 23:25:11	PikFan	going now
2014-10-24 23:25:12	PikFan	bye

2014-10-24 23:29:56	@Espyo	uh,, k
2014-10-24 23:29:59	@Espyo	*-,
2014-10-24 23:49:03	Spark	hm maybe i'll actually just use global variables instead 
2014-10-24 23:51:20	Spark	that sounds stupid and im sure J hates me for it but it actually is probably better in this case...
2014-10-24 23:59:51	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-25 00:00:00	@Espyo	you shouldn't force stuff to be something different JUST for the sake of it
2014-10-25 00:00:06	@Espyo	if you have no reason to do something, why would you?
2014-10-25 00:00:58	Spark	i have a reason
2014-10-25 00:01:08	Spark	but i actually decided it was a bad one
2014-10-25 00:01:16	Spark	so idk what to do now
2014-10-25 00:04:36	@Espyo	well, go global
2014-10-25 00:08:45	Spark	im still reluctant to use something that everyone thinks is bad
2014-10-25 00:08:47	Spark	but like
2014-10-25 00:09:19	Spark	i want to have each tower have a fixed price, and i want to access that price BEFORE the object even exists
2014-10-25 00:09:47	Spark	so i am really confused on what else i could even do :/ maybe if i think about it long enough ill figure it out
2014-10-25 00:10:48	@Espyo	statics work fine for that
2014-10-25 00:13:18	Spark	yeah but if there are going to be three different objects
2014-10-25 00:13:39	Spark	the unplaced tower, the placed tower, and the button to place the tower
2014-10-25 00:13:55	Spark	then idk which one would have the price in it
2014-10-25 00:14:02	@Espyo	well, you still know their class
2014-10-25 00:14:15	@Espyo	or, here's what you can do
2014-10-25 00:14:19	@Espyo	you know about virtual methods?
2014-10-25 00:14:24	Spark	yeah
2014-10-25 00:14:26	@J	meh, it doesn't really matter
2014-10-25 00:14:37	@Espyo	have a — go to bed, J
2014-10-25 00:14:38	@J	games are like the one thing that sometimes don't have feature creep
2014-10-25 00:14:57	@J	and you'll learn eventually
2014-10-25 00:15:05	@Espyo	have a virtual method on the "tower" class called get_price
2014-10-25 00:15:14	@J	but it's a weekend
2014-10-25 00:15:17	@Espyo	then, each sub-class overrides that method to whatever price they want
2014-10-25 00:15:19	@Espyo	oh yeah, so it is
2014-10-25 00:15:34	Spark	and i do the same thing for the UnplacedTower class
2014-10-25 00:15:36	Spark	?
2014-10-25 00:15:55	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-25 00:16:00	@Espyo	all right, it depends on how you organize your classes
2014-10-25 00:16:26	@Espyo	you could have like Tower -> WeakTower -> PlacedWeakTower
2014-10-25 00:16:33	@Espyo	Tower -> WeakTower -> UnplacedWeakTower
2014-10-25 00:16:36	@Espyo	Tower -> WeakTower -> WeakTowerButton
2014-10-25 00:16:55	@J	that seems kind of crazy
2014-10-25 00:17:08	@J	you have 3 entirely different things that reference the same data
2014-10-25 00:17:14	Spark	not necessarily
2014-10-25 00:17:18	Spark	they just have the same sprite
2014-10-25 00:17:35	Spark	the placed tower has a hitbox, the unplaced tower moves with the cursor, and the button is just a button
2014-10-25 00:17:58	@J	yeah, so different things rendering some sort of representation of the same data
2014-10-25 00:18:01	@Espyo	yeah, might not be the best organization, but I'm thinking of other things right now
2014-10-25 00:18:35	@Espyo	yeah, probably a lot better to have an Unplaced, a Placed, and a Button class
2014-10-25 00:19:03	@J	so you just need your tower classes, then PlacedTower/UnplacedTower/TowerButton each store one of those in a property
2014-10-25 00:19:27	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-25 00:19:27	Spark	but then the tower class would be just a sprite
2014-10-25 00:19:34	@Espyo	much like I have on the engine
2014-10-25 00:19:36	Spark	i already have a sprite class anyways
2014-10-25 00:19:41	@Espyo	you have an Onion class, a Pikmin class, etc.
2014-10-25 00:19:53	@Espyo	and they all need to know the Pikmin type, so they can know their main color
2014-10-25 00:19:55	@Espyo	(red, blue, etc.)
2014-10-25 00:20:02	@J	the _only_ thing that differentiates tower types is a sprite?
2014-10-25 00:20:05	@J	that doesn't sound right
2014-10-25 00:20:11	Spark	no but
2014-10-25 00:20:18	@Espyo	so each of them has a pointer to a pikmin_type structure
2014-10-25 00:20:22	@Espyo	with data about the color, name, etc.
2014-10-25 00:20:26	Spark	the unplaced tower will have no properties except the sprite and the type of tower it places
2014-10-25 00:20:30	@Espyo	not QUITE the approach you're taking, but food for thought
2014-10-25 00:20:44	Spark	the button will have no properties except the sprite, the price, and the unplacedtower it creates
2014-10-25 00:20:50	Spark	and the placed tower has all the real stuff
2014-10-25 00:21:27	@J	such as?
2014-10-25 00:21:38	Spark	the way the tower behaves
2014-10-25 00:21:40	Spark	its hitbox
2014-10-25 00:21:46	Spark	its animation
2014-10-25 00:22:18	Spark	i kinda get what youre saying though espy
2014-10-25 00:22:23	Spark	and i see how it could work
2014-10-25 00:23:37	@J	okay, so button and unplaced have references to the tower _type_, and placed has a reference to an instance of that type
2014-10-25 00:23:54	@Espyo	never call stuff like that
2014-10-25 00:24:02	@Espyo	it's like naming your child #mongrel
2014-10-25 00:24:11	@Espyo	why would you name something starting with an underscore
2014-10-25 00:24:12	@Espyo	it's eye cancer
2014-10-25 00:24:23	@J	that was emphasis
2014-10-25 00:24:24	@Espyo	wait, I misread that
2014-10-25 00:24:25	@J	like /type/
2014-10-25 00:24:27	@Espyo	I should uh...
2014-10-25 00:24:33	@Espyo	I should just stick to playing Smash and not looking at IRC
2014-10-25 00:24:36	@Espyo	you two go ahead and continue
2014-10-25 00:24:49	@Espyo	no, but I really do see that a lot in C++ code
2014-10-25 00:24:53	@Espyo	it's disgustingly ugly
2014-10-25 00:25:09	Spark	oh i hate that
2014-10-25 00:25:24	@J	and you probably want to have classes for unplaced and button even though they don't do much, because no doubt you'll want them to do more at some point
2014-10-25 00:25:47	Spark	i think i get what you mean though
2014-10-25 00:25:53	Spark	and i am going to do it :D thanks
2014-10-25 00:26:14	@J	best thing to do in general is just do stuff how you think it makes sense
2014-10-25 00:26:26	@J	you'll get it wrong, then you'll know better for next time
2014-10-25 00:27:35	@Espyo	mhm

2014-10-25 12:25:03	Yoshi2	looks like it will be difficult to get work done on BMS stuff
2014-10-25 12:26:57	@Espyo	how so?
2014-10-25 12:27:33	Yoshi2	homework
2014-10-25 12:28:10	@Espyo	:/
2014-10-25 12:32:40	Yoshi2	it definitely isn't impossible, it depends on how much time it takes me to understand the homework
2014-10-25 12:41:58	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-25 12:48:07	Yoshi2	the SMS guy hasn't uploaded a video about his BMS work in two months now D:
2014-10-25 12:49:48	@Espyo	yeah, it sucks...
2014-10-25 13:00:55	@J	and here I am, no homework to speak of, procrastinating like crazy
2014-10-25 13:03:50	Yoshi2	J: I have plenty of work I could send your way
2014-10-25 13:04:43	Yoshi2	well, I should probably get started now so I don't run into problems with a lack of time later
2014-10-25 13:04:54	@J	that's not how a real student thinks
2014-10-25 13:05:13	@Espyo	^
2014-10-25 13:05:15	@J	'I can probably do this, so the bus ride in on the morning it's due should work'
2014-10-25 13:05:20	@Espyo	wait wait
2014-10-25 13:05:28	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-10-25 13:05:29	@Espyo	German
2014-10-25 13:05:31	@Espyo	I nearly forgot
2014-10-25 13:07:54	@J	pizza time
2014-10-25 13:08:03	Yoshi2	the busses are full
2014-10-25 13:08:13	Yoshi2	there are no chances to do any work in the bus
2014-10-25 13:08:21	@Espyo	aww, sucks
2014-10-25 13:11:09	@J	I used to do all my work either straight away or the day before it was due
2014-10-25 13:11:11	@J	no middle ground
2014-10-25 13:11:33	@Espyo	same here
2014-10-25 13:11:54	@Espyo	there was only one assignment I actually worked hard throughout several days
2014-10-25 13:11:58	@Espyo	and that was for several reasons
2014-10-25 13:12:04	@Espyo	for one thing, we had to make an OpenGL game
2014-10-25 13:12:13	@Espyo	so my motivation was already eighty thousand times higher than anything else
2014-10-25 13:12:32	@Espyo	secondly, I was in this group with this guy that's pretty much a Portuguese youtube celebrity
2014-10-25 13:12:38	@Espyo	so... pressure
2014-10-25 13:12:49	@Espyo	third, we went to a McDonald's to work, instead of going to college
2014-10-25 13:12:56	@Espyo	so the ambiance was at least pretty darn original
2014-10-25 13:13:06	@J	actually, for a lot of the maths there was actual thinking involved
2014-10-25 13:13:35	@J	so I used to read all the questions when I got it, then think about it all week, then hopefully be able to just do the writing at the end
2014-10-25 13:14:07	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2014-10-25 13:14:29	@J	they let you work at McDonald's?
2014-10-25 13:15:36	@Espyo	work = stay on our laptops and code some
2014-10-25 13:15:40	@Espyo	also it was a leisure area
2014-10-25 13:15:50	@Espyo	not so much inside the actual restaurant
2014-10-25 13:15:56	@Espyo	but we still had to buy SOMETHING to stay there
2014-10-25 13:21:40	Yoshi2	we once bought ice cream in a wafer at some ice cream place, but they wouldn't even let us sit in the chairs outside, citing some stupid regulations or whatever
2014-10-25 13:25:49	Yoshi2	according to the person who told us to leave, every other ice cream café does it the same, but I have yet to confirm that
2014-10-25 13:26:53	@Espyo	eesh
2014-10-25 13:27:26	Yoshi2	couldn't find anything official on the Internet either
2014-10-25 13:29:33	@Espyo	makes sense
2014-10-25 13:29:41	@Espyo	you're in spots other, loyal customers could be taking
2014-10-25 13:29:48	@Espyo	instead, you're just there, and not even buying their things
2014-10-25 13:30:01	@Espyo	and to top it off, you're buying stuff from the competition, as if mocking them
2014-10-25 13:30:39	Yoshi2	well, yes
2014-10-25 13:31:13	Yoshi2	except for the part where the chairs were in front of the café we bought the ice cream from
2014-10-25 13:31:27	@Espyo	hmmmmmm
2014-10-25 13:31:44	Yoshi2	it was also evening, and none of the other chairs were taken
2014-10-25 13:32:03	@Espyo	dunno then, just regulations
2014-10-25 13:33:08	Yoshi2	I call it "shitty customer service"
2014-10-25 13:33:09	Testyo	Swear words make me sad :(
2014-10-25 13:33:52	Yoshi2	I'm definitely not going to buy anything there ever again
2014-10-25 13:34:02	Yoshi2	Testyo: poor you
2014-10-25 13:34:03	Testyo	instead of opening the sheets down to put my other leg in, I stretched the other leg to try to get it inside, even though the battle!

2014-10-25 13:36:00	@Espyo	DAMMIT
2014-10-25 13:36:08	@Espyo	I still haven't solved it
2014-10-25 13:36:21	@Espyo	they reset my router settings, so port exceptions were deleted
2014-10-25 13:37:29	@Espyo	he says the swear complaint chance is one in 50
2014-10-25 13:37:31	@Espyo	that can't be right
2014-10-25 13:43:08	Yoshi2	for every 50 swear words, it has one complaint
2014-10-25 13:43:51	Yoshi2	Testyo: shit
2014-10-25 13:43:52	Testyo	or two things that can catch you off guard and make you hate it
2014-10-25 13:44:01	Yoshi2	no complaints? :(

2014-10-25 15:08:18	Yoshi2	awesome indeed!
2014-10-25 15:09:17	Yoshi2	hm, if I knew more about gui stuff, I'd consider creating a BMS editor
2014-10-25 15:19:03	Yoshi2	but I don't, so my best bet would be to create a sort of text representation of the BMS format
2014-10-25 15:19:26	Yoshi2	which would till take a long time to create, so I'm not going to do that

2014-10-25 15:19:44	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-25 15:23:52	@J	GUI stuff is easy
2014-10-25 15:24:41	@Espyo	said nobody ever
2014-10-25 15:24:49	@Espyo	yeah, you made GCEdit easily
2014-10-25 15:25:03	@Espyo	and now nobody on windows can touch the window's size or dimensions without risking a system freeze
2014-10-25 15:25:04	@Espyo	ez pz
2014-10-25 15:25:15	@J	hey, that's GTK's fault
2014-10-25 15:25:36	@Espyo	if you mean GUI DESIGN is easy...
2014-10-25 15:25:39	@Espyo	well, to each their own
2014-10-25 15:25:41	@J	anyway, the most important thing is that you make the core stuff independent of any user interface
2014-10-25 15:25:48	@Espyo	but adding GUI to your programs has like infinite underlying problems, it always does
2014-10-25 15:25:51	@J	no, I do mean the technical side
2014-10-25 15:26:12	@Espyo	well, is Qt working any better for you?
2014-10-25 15:26:20	@J	anyway, if it's independent, you can add a GUI later if you want
2014-10-25 15:26:25	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-25 15:26:29	@Espyo	also if it's well done
2014-10-25 15:26:30	@J	or someone else can do it more easily
2014-10-25 15:26:35	@J	Qt is better, yes
2014-10-25 15:26:37	@Espyo	a good program doesn't rely on the GUI
2014-10-25 15:26:49	@Espyo	any reported stupidity like the GTK window moving?
2014-10-25 15:27:10	@J	Qt is quite well-supported on Windows, though I haven't tried it on Windows yet
2014-10-25 15:27:28	@J	theme icons might be a pain to get working, but that's non-essential
2014-10-25 15:28:05	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-25 15:28:25	@Espyo	but who knows, I've seen loads of GTK programs, and they were always fine on windows
2014-10-25 15:28:27	@Espyo	and then suddenly boom
2014-10-25 15:28:33	@J	I haven't done anything for about a week, though
2014-10-25 15:28:39	@J	mostly because I went back to Dustforce
2014-10-25 15:28:44	@J	those are all GTK2
2014-10-25 15:29:07	Yoshi2	I wanted to do something with Qt, but somehow the development kit was like 1 GB in size
2014-10-25 15:29:16	@J	I decided to use the newer GTK3 (2 is no longer in development)
2014-10-25 15:29:28	@J	I was silly to assume it would be just as cross-platform
2014-10-25 15:29:40	@J	I have used GTK2 on Windows before with success
2014-10-25 15:29:59	@J	Yoshi2: you probably don't need all that
2014-10-25 15:30:01	@Espyo	hm, I see then
2014-10-25 15:31:36	@J	the core Qt and PyQt packages for Qt5 seems to be around 75MiB in total here
2014-10-25 15:31:47	@J	of course that includes documentation and headers and examples

2014-10-29 13:18:17	@Espyo	which one do you use?
2014-10-29 13:19:53	Yoshi2	there are two I've used so far, hxd is good and can be downloaded in a version that does not require installing it
2014-10-29 13:20:06	@Espyo	yeah, I use HxD too, mostly
2014-10-29 13:20:11	@Espyo	I recently found a pretty complex one

2014-10-29 13:21:09	Yoshi2	hexedit isn't too bad, has ways to mark specific hex values with colors and there is a marker for marking things with a single color
2014-10-29 13:22:59	Yoshi2	but I dislike installers
2014-10-29 13:23:19	Yoshi2	I'll probably grab it from my PC when I'm back
2014-10-29 13:24:23	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-29 13:38:58	Yoshi2	java is kind of fun, but some things do feel odd about it

2014-10-31 21:16:20	@PikFan	okay so
2014-10-31 21:16:48	@PikFan	last night I suddenly got a lot of creativity, and began rethinking a lot of things in my game
2014-10-31 21:17:23	@PikFan	lot of things in my game are unbalanced
2014-10-31 21:18:01	@PikFan	for example, in [[f:The Garden]], you discover three Pikmin types at the same time

2014-10-31 21:18:49	@PikFan	and Purples are the second type discovered
2014-10-31 21:18:57	@PikFan	so many things unbalanced

2014-10-31 21:21:26	@PikFan	also, I want each area (except for the last three) to be visited at least twice
2014-10-31 21:21:42	@PikFan	...ooh
2014-10-31 21:21:47	@PikFan	perfect idea
2014-10-31 21:22:02	@PikFan	after the main game there should be another storyline
2014-10-31 21:22:05	@PikFan	but shorter
2014-10-31 21:23:03	@PikFan	see, what I was thinking was that when the player reached the Diamond Key in the [[f:Ancient Valley]], the villains split it up into four pieces, and scatter them across the areas
2014-10-31 21:23:04	Testyo	"Ancient_Valley" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Ancient_Valley
2014-10-31 21:37:52	@Espyo	heh
2014-10-31 21:38:00	@Espyo	yeah, at least twice
2014-10-31 21:38:02	@Espyo	rule of thumb
2014-10-31 21:41:51	@PikFan	also, I don't think it's fair that you have to go through 500 levels just to get 25 special Pikmin
2014-10-31 21:42:01	@PikFan	well, 600
2014-10-31 21:42:08	@PikFan	maybe like do the first 100
2014-10-31 21:42:16	@PikFan	then come back and only do 10
2014-10-31 21:46:26	@PikFan	let's see...
2014-10-31 21:46:33	@PikFan	Yellows are necessary
2014-10-31 21:46:38	@PikFan	Blues... eh
2014-10-31 21:46:45	@PikFan	Whites could go somewhere else

2014-10-31 22:19:35	@PikFan	so noisy
2014-10-31 22:19:42	@PikFan	hardly ever quiet
2014-10-31 22:21:17	Yoshi2	as far as I can remember, if a school class is quiet, that is the exception rather than the rule
2014-10-31 22:21:26	@PikFan	no, but
2014-10-31 22:21:33	@PikFan	someone was presenting
2014-10-31 22:21:46	@PikFan	and she was getting frustrated because hardly anyone was listening
2014-10-31 22:22:05	@PikFan	kids were up out of their seats, taking videos, selfies, etc
2014-10-31 22:22:39	Yoshi2	no teacher to yell at the kids?
2014-10-31 22:22:54	@PikFan	she tries to, but they don't listen
2014-10-31 22:23:33	Yoshi2	well, that is horrible indeed
2014-10-31 22:24:05	Yoshi2	I've had some teachers who knew how to silence the class
2014-10-31 22:24:39	Yoshi2	in some cases the class was quiet for the entire duration of the lesson

2014-11-01 14:32:39	Yoshi2	hm, as far as I can tell, Pikmin 1 uses two bytes for volume in the BMS file, while Mario Sunshine uses only one byte
2014-11-01 14:32:55	@Espyo	I think you reached that conclusion before
2014-11-01 14:32:59	@Espyo	or at least something similar
2014-11-01 14:33:02	Yoshi2	Wind Waker and Pikmin 2 use two bytes again, though Pikmin 1 was released earlier than SMS
2014-11-01 14:33:11	@Espyo	Nintendo in charge of consistency...
2014-11-01 14:33:22	Yoshi2	yes, I might have reached that conclusion before
2014-11-01 14:33:34	Yoshi2	but I had that wrong in the previous parsing code
2014-11-01 14:34:05	Yoshi2	in SMS, the code tried to read two bytes for the volume
2014-11-01 14:34:18	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Region by Espyo (+281 /* Pikmin */ andypanther from tasvideos.org reminded me.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Region&curid=9879&diff=141788&oldid=139970
2014-11-01 14:34:48	Yoshi2	that can mean one thing:
2014-11-01 14:35:15	Yoshi2	development of the audio engine for SMS and Pikmin 1 worked in parallel, maybe even independent from each other
2014-11-01 14:35:37	Yoshi2	or maybe the audio engine for SMS was finalized earlier
2014-11-01 14:36:11	Yoshi2	or maybe I'm completely wrong with my theories, I have no idea how Nintendo works
2014-11-01 14:37:09	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-01 14:40:42	Yoshi2	but thinking up such theories could be useful for assigning an estimated BMS version to each game that uses it
2014-11-01 14:41:08	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-01 14:41:26	Yoshi2	so far I gave Pikmin 1 the lowest BMS version, but maybe SMS has a lower one
2014-11-01 14:42:06	@Espyo	probably, who knows
2014-11-01 14:47:42	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is a way to take a look at the game's code that parses the BMS files
2014-11-01 14:48:17	Yoshi2	I suppose it would be close to unreadable due to being compiled
2014-11-01 14:53:04	Yoshi2	but any clue about how the events are read would be useful
2014-11-01 14:54:12	Testyo	mhm fix that
2014-11-01 14:54:59	Yoshi2	Testyo: stop it, you are being creepy again
2014-11-01 14:54:59	Testyo	There is no game in progress right now!
2014-11-01 15:04:48	@Espyo	yeah, unless you know assembly
2014-11-01 15:04:52	@Espyo	and have the patience for assembly
2014-11-01 15:07:09	Yoshi2	indeed

2014-11-02 14:55:52	Klemen702	Hi
2014-11-02 14:56:04	Klemen702	Im just testing this
2014-11-02 14:57:56	Klemen702	what does that star mean?
2014-11-02 14:58:04	Klemen702	mod?
2014-11-02 15:00:24	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-02 15:00:26	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-02 15:00:36	Klemen702	oh
2014-11-02 15:00:37	Klemen702	hi
2014-11-02 15:02:57	Klemen702	i have a question
2014-11-02 15:03:40	Klemen702	how does one get pikmin map layouts such as this http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Map_06_HD.jpg
2014-11-02 15:04:05	Klemen702	ah the link didn't work
2014-11-02 15:04:25	@Espyo	it worked for me
2014-11-02 15:04:32	@Espyo	I did that taking screenshots with an emulator
2014-11-02 15:04:36	@Espyo	and then I used a tool to stitch them up
2014-11-02 15:04:53	Klemen702	ooh i see
2014-11-02 15:05:58	@Espyo	I still have to do that for Pikmin 2 and 3...
2014-11-02 15:06:02	@Espyo	boy, that's gonna take a while
2014-11-02 15:06:14	Klemen702	are you gonna do that for the caves aswell?
2014-11-02 15:06:33	@Espyo	no, because caves change randomly
2014-11-02 15:06:38	@Espyo	so there's no real "layout"
2014-11-02 15:06:44	@Espyo	though I guess I could do it, for an example layout
2014-11-02 15:06:52	@Espyo	and then put a warning saying "note: this is only an example layout"
2014-11-02 15:06:54	@Espyo	or something
2014-11-02 15:06:59	@Espyo	oh, but there's another problem
2014-11-02 15:07:05	Klemen702	and that is?
2014-11-02 15:07:17	@Espyo	I use free-camera to take the screenshots for Pikmin 1 and 2
2014-11-02 15:07:19	@Espyo	and they work fine
2014-11-02 15:07:28	@Espyo	but in caves, if you use free-cam to check another part of the cave
2014-11-02 15:07:29	@Espyo	it's just not there
2014-11-02 15:07:43	@Espyo	unless I go to each part of the cave myself and move the camera up manually each time
2014-11-02 15:07:47	@Espyo	which is gonna be horrible to synch up
2014-11-02 15:07:53	@Espyo	plus getting rid of the HUD on every single one
2014-11-02 15:08:39	Klemen702	that would be alot of hard work i assume
2014-11-02 15:09:00	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-11-02 15:09:07	@Espyo	so IF I do it, I'll leave it to last
2014-11-02 15:09:11	@Espyo	I have more important tasks first

2014-11-03 20:28:13	@PikFan	I'm thinking it escalates, and some sort of conflict occurs

2014-11-03 20:28:47	@PikFan	Yes
2014-11-03 20:29:23	@PikFan	And then they enter an alternate version of PNF-404
2014-11-03 20:29:33	@PikFan	Where different Pikmin types exist
2014-11-03 20:30:59	@PikFan	Thing is, I'm not sure how to write it all out

2014-11-03 23:17:55	@PikFan	they haven't been released yet
2014-11-03 23:18:14	@Espyo	well, they have been shown
2014-11-03 23:18:19	@Espyo	but nope, we still don't know where to get them
2014-11-03 23:18:19	@PikFan	there was a trailer, but I don't think the movies themselves have come out yet
2014-11-03 23:18:31	@Espyo	if they're even around the internet somewhere
2014-11-03 23:18:39	@Espyo	PikFan: I realized a new plucking technique just now

2014-11-03 23:18:48	@PikFan	which game?

2014-11-03 23:18:53	Goldsum	Ah alright, thats a bumper, they look really nice from the trailers
2014-11-03 23:18:53	@PikFan	oh
2014-11-03 23:19:00	@Espyo	if you press A near a sprout, you pluck it, even if you cancel
2014-11-03 23:19:04	@Espyo	it just plucks by itself
2014-11-03 23:19:09	@Espyo	so press A, cancel, go to the next, repeat
2014-11-03 23:19:10	@Espyo	super fast
2014-11-03 23:19:39	@PikFan	faster than automatic pluck?

2014-11-03 23:24:02	@PikFan	nice
2014-11-03 23:24:06	@PikFan	and my friend says hi
2014-11-03 23:24:10	@Espyo	hey
2014-11-03 23:24:16	@Espyo	auto-pluck moves you at movement speed
2014-11-03 23:24:23	@Espyo	or at least at leaf Pikmin speed
2014-11-03 23:24:31	@PikFan	wow
2014-11-03 23:24:35	@Espyo	either way, your manual movement is as fast or faster
2014-11-03 23:24:38	@Espyo	so
2014-11-03 23:24:40	@Espyo	if you cancel
2014-11-03 23:24:51	@Espyo	you can move to the next one either as fast as normal auto-pluck, or faster
2014-11-03 23:24:53	@Espyo	BUT
2014-11-03 23:24:59	@Espyo	you COMPLETELY skip the pluck animation
2014-11-03 23:25:01	@Espyo	so yeah, quite a bit faster
2014-11-03 23:25:05	@Espyo	SPECIALLY when loads are together
2014-11-03 23:25:12	@PikFan	so you're teleporting, basically
2014-11-03 23:25:21	@PikFan	while magically making Pikmin appear
2014-11-03 23:25:26	@Espyo	not teleporting
2014-11-03 23:25:33	@Espyo	you cancel, move to the next one manually with the stick, and pluck that
2014-11-03 23:25:35	@Espyo	rinse and repeat
2014-11-03 23:25:41	@Espyo	the Pikmin pluck by themselves
2014-11-03 23:25:46	@PikFan	oh
2014-11-03 23:25:58	@PikFan	mm, alright

2014-11-04 16:13:10	Spark	hey so Espyo, if i want to have a class where certain variables are always the same, would using static variables or setting it in the constructor be better?
2014-11-04 16:13:45	@Espyo	if they always have the same value, a static const would do nicely
2014-11-04 16:13:57	@Espyo	if they're just the same variable, shared through all instances of the class, then a normal static works
2014-11-04 16:14:37	Spark	what about setting it in the constructor though? are there any reasons to do/not do that instead
2014-11-04 16:14:54	@Espyo	setting in the constructor? like how?
2014-11-04 16:15:16	Spark	just say, variable = "value";
2014-11-04 16:16:07	@Espyo	doing that means that the argument is optional
2014-11-04 16:16:10	@Espyo	you can override it
2014-11-04 16:16:23	@Espyo	my_tower(int hp = 3000);
2014-11-04 16:16:27	@Espyo	you can do my_tower()
2014-11-04 16:16:32	@Espyo	and its HP gets set to 3000
2014-11-04 16:16:42	@Espyo	but you can still do my_tower(555); to change it to 555
2014-11-04 16:16:59	@Espyo	if you don't want it to be changed, you probably don't want to do the constructor method

2014-11-04 16:19:06	Spark02	hm
2014-11-04 16:19:24	Spark02	so for my purposes, if i want it to be the same every time, there's no real differnence?
2014-11-04 16:20:48	@Espyo	yeah

2014-11-04 16:20:59	@Espyo	depends a bit on how your code is
2014-11-04 16:21:07	Spark02	so, static would be better?
2014-11-04 16:26:17	@Espyo	again, depends on the code
2014-11-04 16:26:22	@Espyo	I'd have to see the whole thing to say

2014-11-04 22:18:23	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-04 22:18:31	@Espyo	it's used in a speedrun
2014-11-04 22:18:35	@Espyo	so I wasn't the first to discover
2014-11-04 22:18:58	@PikFan	mm
2014-11-04 22:20:44	@PikFan	wait, there was another PikCast?
2014-11-04 22:21:15	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-04 22:21:23	@Espyo	don't even know when it happened

2014-11-04 22:21:48	@PikFan	you weren't invited?
2014-11-04 22:22:32	@Espyo	people just kinda invite themselves
2014-11-04 22:22:42	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2014-11-04 22:22:54	@PikFan	are people on the skype chat right now?
2014-11-04 22:23:44	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-04 22:23:50	@PikFan	ah
2014-11-04 22:24:48	@PikFan	hmm, I can't really imagine using a voice chat
2014-11-04 22:25:26	@PikFan	cause like, in voice chat, you can't go back and look at what they just said
2014-11-04 22:25:44	@PikFan	and things would go awry if everyone started talking at once
2014-11-04 22:26:00	@PikFan	because then you couldn't understand anyone
2014-11-04 22:26:19	@Espyo	hehe
2014-11-04 22:26:44	@PikFan	they don't use JUST voice chats, do they?
2014-11-04 22:28:00	@Espyo	they type too
2014-11-04 22:28:08	@PikFan	good to know
2014-11-04 22:28:09	@Espyo	one of them's in the call, but only listening
2014-11-04 22:28:11	@Espyo	and talking by typing
2014-11-04 22:28:13	@PikFan	mm
2014-11-04 22:28:18	@Espyo	but they only really call like 1 hour a day or so
2014-11-04 22:28:23	@Espyo	they type everywhere else
2014-11-04 22:28:29	@PikFan	alright
2014-11-04 22:28:58	@PikFan	I can't get onto Skype right now, obviously
2014-11-04 22:29:16	@PikFan	even if I could I'd be a bit leery about logging in
2014-11-04 22:29:39	@PikFan	I've said this before, but it'd be convenient if they used the wiki's chat
2014-11-04 22:30:01	@PikFan	I guess the prospect of Testyo wasn't enough to tide them over

2014-11-04 23:00:23	@PikFan	is it needed?
2014-11-04 23:00:25	@PikFan	hmmmmm

2014-11-05 22:28:04	@PikFan	back
2014-11-05 22:28:31	@PikFan	okay so I'm stressed out because we're going to the library in a bit and we have to pick out books for our research project
2014-11-05 22:32:32	@Espyo	Pikmin 3
2014-11-05 22:32:37	@Espyo	there's a Nintendo Direct on right now
2014-11-05 22:32:40	@Espyo	they JUST finished the Pikmin part
2014-11-05 22:32:50	@Espyo	short movies on Wii U or 3DS, for $5
2014-11-05 22:32:50	Testyo	$ 5 = 3.686 € / £ 3.1525 
2014-11-05 22:32:59	@PikFan	when?
2014-11-05 22:33:27	@PikFan	...ooh, just found out we're not going to the library today!
2014-11-05 22:33:38	@PikFan	but yeah, when?
2014-11-05 22:35:37	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_3#Tremendous_Sniffer_without_bomb_rocks
2014-11-05 22:35:48	@PikFan	"The Tremendous Sniffer gets lodged into the wall, something that should not occur. As such, the game will move the pear out of the wall, but cannot return it to its original location. Therefore, it moves it to the other side of the wall."
2014-11-05 22:35:55	@PikFan	I /think/ that's why
2014-11-05 22:36:10	@PikFan	but I don't have much technical knowledge to be sure
2014-11-05 22:37:51	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-05 22:38:13	@Espyo	I think it's more of a case of the game saving the fruit's position, but in order to minimize the amount of data it has to save, it doesn't save the EXACT coordinates
2014-11-05 22:38:29	@Espyo	like, it doesn't save "behind the gate, exactly 3 cm to the West and 1.5cm to the North"
2014-11-05 22:38:29	Testyo	3 cm = 1.1814 in / 0.0984 ft / 1.57895 Olimar-heights
2014-11-05 22:38:39	@Espyo	it saves in like a grid
2014-11-05 22:38:46	@PikFan	mm
2014-11-05 22:38:51	@Espyo	and the default position is close to the edge of the normal grid cell
2014-11-05 22:38:54	@Espyo	and moving it a bit to the side
2014-11-05 22:38:57	@Espyo	puts it on the next cell
2014-11-05 22:39:00	@PikFan	this is why I brought it up, because you have more tech savvy
2014-11-05 22:39:09	@Espyo	and when the game loads, all it knows is that it's on the other cell, not the cell it spawned in
2014-11-05 22:39:14	@Espyo	so it just spawns it in the center of the cell
2014-11-05 22:39:24	@Espyo	which happens to be outside the gate
2014-11-05 22:39:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-05 22:39:35	@Espyo	I don't think you have "savvy" with "have"
2014-11-05 22:40:12	@PikFan	are you sure?
2014-11-05 22:40:19	@PikFan	it seems like "have" should be in there
2014-11-05 22:40:28	@Espyo	nope
2014-11-05 22:40:32	@Espyo	it's to be
2014-11-05 22:40:35	@Espyo	I think
2014-11-05 22:40:39	@Espyo	like, "you're more tech savvy"
2014-11-05 22:40:52	@PikFan	oh,hmm
2014-11-05 22:40:56	@PikFan	*+ 
2014-11-05 22:41:21	@PikFan	thought savvy was something that someone could have
2014-11-05 22:42:09	@Espyo	nope, don't think it is
2014-11-05 22:42:20	@Espyo	anyway, they said on the Direct that they'll do more Pikmin 3 Miiverse things
2014-11-05 22:42:52	@PikFan	anything about Pikmin 3 itself?
2014-11-05 22:44:56	@Espyo	just the demo
2014-11-05 22:45:16	@PikFan	a downloadable demo for the game?
2014-11-05 22:45:25	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-05 22:45:29	@Espyo	the save is transferable
2014-11-05 22:45:35	@PikFan	they should have made that demo when the game came out
2014-11-05 22:45:39	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-11-05 22:45:42	@Espyo	a bit late now
2014-11-05 22:45:48	@PikFan	Nintendo seems to be in lacking of common sense
2014-11-05 22:45:53	@PikFan	a lot of it, too
2014-11-05 22:46:21	@PikFan	also, you never answered my question from earlier
2014-11-05 22:46:34	@Espyo	oh, can't remember the date
2014-11-05 22:46:36	@Espyo	if they did say
2014-11-05 22:46:43	@PikFan	mm
2014-11-05 22:46:54	@PikFan	I'll watch the Direct when I get home
2014-11-05 22:47:13	@PikFan	I hope P3 gets more DLC
2014-11-05 22:47:46	@PikFan	I have platinum on all Defeat Bosses! stages except for the final boss
2014-11-05 22:48:11	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebekXCaC9w0
2014-11-05 22:48:17	@Espyo	no news on new DLC
2014-11-05 22:48:19	@Espyo	but I hope so too
2014-11-05 22:49:14	UltraMario	i hope someone uploads the full thing on youtube </toomuchmoney4me>>
2014-11-05 22:49:50	UltraMario	cuz i'm probably gonna buy all the things comfirmed except xenoblade x and project steam
2014-11-05 22:49:54	@PikFan	"Nintendo clarified to IGN that the film collections are console-specific, meaning if you purchase the 3DS version you don’t automatically own it on Wii U."
2014-11-05 22:49:56	@PikFan	gaaaaah
2014-11-05 22:50:06	@PikFan	why why why Nintendo are you being so picky
2014-11-05 22:50:13	UltraMario	because one's 3d
2014-11-05 22:50:15	UltraMario	and one's hd :P
2014-11-05 22:50:22	UltraMario	i'd just get it on the wii u
2014-11-05 22:50:32	UltraMario	because HD > 3D
2014-11-05 22:50:52	@PikFan	I don't think they'll be in 3D
2014-11-05 22:50:57	@PikFan	did they say that?
2014-11-05 22:51:01	UltraMario	it said they were in 3d :|

2014-11-05 22:51:08	UltraMario	it was like that at the film festival too
2014-11-05 22:51:21	@PikFan	er, yes
2014-11-05 22:51:24	@PikFan	never mind
2014-11-05 22:51:38	UltraMario	why would they just put an inferior version of a film on the 3ds version and not go with the console's gimmick? :P
2014-11-05 22:51:47	@PikFan	but still, I don't like how Nintendo chooses to separate the eShops between consoles
2014-11-05 22:51:59	UltraMario	...you know they still never put 3d movies on there like they said at e3 2011...
2014-11-05 22:52:00	UltraMario	:/
2014-11-05 22:52:14	@PikFan	true
2014-11-05 22:52:28	UltraMario	yay for false promises...
2014-11-05 22:52:36	UltraMario	i guess they scrapped that concept altogether
2014-11-05 22:52:39	@PikFan	I don't see why Nintendo can't have one fully unified eShop for both consoles
2014-11-05 22:52:44	UltraMario	kinda like new super mario bros. mii
2014-11-05 22:52:51	UltraMario	because they have different games? :P
2014-11-05 22:52:54	@PikFan	that was a demo
2014-11-05 22:53:01	@PikFan	for E3
2014-11-05 22:53:07	UltraMario	yeah i know
2014-11-05 22:53:07	@PikFan	no, but
2014-11-05 22:53:08	UltraMario	but still
2014-11-05 22:53:16	@PikFan	aren't your balances separated?
2014-11-05 22:53:20	UltraMario	it's like super mario 128 almost
2014-11-05 22:53:21	UltraMario	no

2014-11-07 19:42:41	@J	so this week at work, we discovered 3 bugs that work beautifully together
2014-11-07 19:42:51	@J	one lets you bypass authentication
2014-11-07 19:43:07	@J	one lets you impersonate another user if you can bypass authentication
2014-11-07 19:43:25	@J	one is an SQL injection that only works if you can impersonate another user
2014-11-07 19:45:36	Yoshi2	J: are you sure that this is not a feature?
2014-11-07 19:46:33	@J	hope not
2014-11-07 19:46:45	@J	but this was all code written by another team, so who knows
2014-11-07 19:47:12	Yoshi2	an SQL injection that only works if you impersonate another user seems a bit odd to me
2014-11-07 19:51:24	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-07 19:51:32	@Espyo	but anyway, at this day and age, who lets SQL injections go by?
2014-11-07 19:51:55	Yoshi2	SQL injection seems so easy to avoid
2014-11-07 19:55:12	@J	well, it's because rather than impersonating a user, you say your user id contains some nasty SQL
2014-11-07 19:55:41	@J	Espyo: yeah, it's really bad
2014-11-07 19:55:55	@J	good news is that other team left the project a while back
2014-11-07 20:46:25	Yoshi2	ah, that does make sense
2014-11-07 21:17:01	@J	so, uh...apparently the Dustforce user-created maps difficulty rating system has 3/5 at above the difficulty of the hardest stock levels I've unlocked so far
2014-11-07 21:19:08	@Espyo	obviously this means you have to check out a 5/5
2014-11-07 21:19:11	@Espyo	and probably die of heart attack

2014-11-07 21:27:16	@J	some guy creates an level with no end

2014-11-07 21:37:37	@J	just read those comments
2014-11-07 21:37:40	@J	I don't even want to try it
2014-11-07 21:45:09	@Espyo	with no end?
2014-11-07 21:45:42	@Espyo	oh, I guess it's a beginner that didn't even add an endpoint
2014-11-07 21:49:31	@J	I think that's actually the guy who made the music for the game, so I don't know what's going on
2014-11-07 21:49:34	@J	probably testing stuff
2014-11-07 21:52:48	@Espyo	you know what they say, good composers aren't good leve designers
2014-11-07 21:57:46	@Espyo	when will Pikmin 2's mysteries end?
2014-11-07 21:57:53	@Espyo	the napkins you see on Glutton's Kitchen 2
2014-11-07 21:57:55	@Espyo	are exclusive to that area
2014-11-07 21:58:02	@Espyo	err, sublevel
2014-11-07 21:58:06	@Espyo	and they're actually Chiyogami paper
2014-11-07 21:58:12	@Espyo	a cheap alternative to Origami paper
2014-11-07 21:58:23	@Espyo	...and their object is coded like an enemy

2014-11-08 12:10:33	@Espyo	you'd think so
2014-11-08 12:10:37	@Espyo	but they even put it on the news
2014-11-08 12:10:51	@Espyo	warning people that turning off the power so that standby lights are off are actually huge power savers
2014-11-08 12:10:55	@J	the news is crazy
2014-11-08 12:10:58	@Espyo	probably
2014-11-08 12:10:58	@J	I never watch it
2014-11-08 12:11:04	@Espyo	either way, it's still a save
2014-11-08 12:11:06	@Espyo	so *shrug*
2014-11-08 12:11:21	@Espyo	plus if there's a nasty short circuit during the night because of the lightning
2014-11-08 12:11:24	@J	wait, suddenly phone call
2014-11-08 12:11:27	@Espyo	at least my appliances will be safe
2014-11-08 12:11:28	@Espyo	all right
2014-11-08 12:13:35	Yoshi2	morning Espyo 
2014-11-08 12:13:42	@Espyo	morning
2014-11-08 12:14:35	Yoshi2	well, the lights probably don't take enough power to make it matter
2014-11-08 12:15:06	Yoshi2	I'd take a guess that the circuits for listening for a button press take more power than the light
2014-11-08 12:15:25	@J	[12:11:21] @Espyo plus if there's a nasty short circuit during the night because of the lightning
2014-11-08 12:15:36	@J	wouldn't that just trip a fuse and not do anything
2014-11-08 12:15:49	@J	[12:15:06] Yoshi2 I'd take a guess that the circuits for listening for a button press take more power than the light
2014-11-08 12:15:53	@J	yeah, that's probably true
2014-11-08 12:16:27	@J	anyway, just out of interest, each 4mW LED will use 126kJ per year
2014-11-08 12:16:37	@J	which is 31.5 calories
2014-11-08 12:17:06	@J	or 0.035 'units' the electricity company charges you
2014-11-08 12:17:30	@J	which would cost me about 0.5p
2014-11-08 12:17:44	@J	£0.00.5
2014-11-08 12:17:44	Testyo	£ 0.00 = 0 € / $ 0 
2014-11-08 12:17:47	@J	hmm
2014-11-08 12:17:51	@J	£0.01
2014-11-08 12:17:51	Testyo	£ 0.01 = 0.011693 € / $ 0.015861 
2014-11-08 12:18:09	@J	yeah, near enough 0.5 Euro cents
2014-11-08 12:18:09	Testyo	0.5 Euro = £ 0.4276  / $ 0.6782 
2014-11-08 12:18:14	Yoshi2	I bet the news about the energy saving was paid for by companies who produce these sockets that can be switched off
2014-11-08 12:18:54	@J	so yeah, the food energy you would use to turn off that switch every day is probably more than the electricity it would waste
2014-11-08 12:19:26	@J	you would probably be better of turning off the heating 1 hour earlier on just one day in the year
2014-11-08 12:19:30	@J	*better off

2014-11-08 15:11:56	@J	what did you even do
2014-11-08 15:12:07	@Espyo	good question
2014-11-08 15:12:45	@J	http://i.imgur.com/VPY0ZZY.png
2014-11-08 15:12:47	@J	I sometimes get that
2014-11-08 15:12:53	@J	(not Firefox)
2014-11-08 15:12:54	@Espyo	oh, same here
2014-11-08 15:13:07	@Espyo	yeah, that's pretty much what happens
2014-11-08 15:13:12	@J	hmm, really?
2014-11-08 15:13:12	@Espyo	this screenshot was just a VERY bad case
2014-11-08 15:13:20	@Espyo	messes with the GUI too
2014-11-08 15:13:29	@Espyo	resizing the window normally fixes it
2014-11-08 15:13:30	@J	because I think that's caused by the rounded borders we have
2014-11-08 15:13:35	@Espyo	uh...
2014-11-08 15:13:39	@J	let me try other browsers
2014-11-08 15:13:41	@Espyo	I think it happened on other websites
2014-11-08 15:13:50	@Espyo	plus, I don't get that ALL the time
2014-11-08 15:13:51	@Espyo	it's pretty random
2014-11-08 15:14:10	@Espyo	HAH
2014-11-08 15:14:13	@Espyo	I made a Breadbug so fast
2014-11-08 15:14:16	@Espyo	it can't enter its nest
2014-11-08 15:14:19	@J	...
2014-11-08 15:14:21	@Espyo	it can only circle it at high speeds
2014-11-08 15:14:27	@J	video please
2014-11-08 15:14:28	@Espyo	I'm making a video of all of these shenanigans
2014-11-08 15:14:32	@Espyo	all at once
2014-11-08 15:14:37	@Espyo	I'll put it on youtube when I'm done
2014-11-08 15:14:41	@Espyo	so expect to see it in a year's time
2014-11-08 15:14:53	@J	okay, I just discovered Midori lets you scroll using hjkl
2014-11-08 15:14:55	@J	that's great
2014-11-08 15:15:25	@J	yeah, I get the glitch in Midori and Uzbl, but not Chromium or Firefox
2014-11-08 15:15:36	@Espyo	really weird, then
2014-11-08 15:15:40	@J	both the ones affected use Webkit, so it's probably a specific Webkit version
2014-11-08 15:16:42	@J	yeah, it appears that both of those depend on the webkitgtk2 package, whereas Chromium provides its own
2014-11-08 15:16:47	@J	so that'll be it
2014-11-08 15:16:58	@J	should't affect Firefox, then
2014-11-08 15:17:10	@Espyo	what if you try removing the border?
2014-11-08 15:18:11	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Breadbug%20Circuit.gif
2014-11-08 15:18:36	@J	fixes it
2014-11-08 15:18:51	@J	everything else with round borders has the same glitch
2014-11-08 15:19:19	@J	wait, if it's that fast backwards, how fast is it forwards?
2014-11-08 15:19:37	@J	also, you cut off the collision with the other breadbug
2014-11-08 15:19:50	@J	it's like it teleports it out of the way
2014-11-08 15:21:06	@J	yeah, this would go great with some circus music
2014-11-08 15:21:46	@Espyo	there is a property for forwards speed
2014-11-08 15:21:52	@Espyo	...except it only makes them slide along the ground
2014-11-08 15:21:58	@Espyo	at the same speed as usuaç
2014-11-08 15:22:00	@Espyo	*usual
2014-11-08 15:22:10	@Espyo	I captured loads of collisions for the actual video, don't worry
2014-11-08 15:22:27	@J	good
2014-11-08 15:22:41	@Espyo	nothing can even detour this behemoth
2014-11-08 15:22:44	@Espyo	it's way too strong
2014-11-08 15:22:49	@J	okay, this Dustforce user level is just every level from one area of the game joined together
2014-11-08 15:22:49	@Espyo	it just pushes the others out of the way
2014-11-08 15:23:05	@J	it took me 13 minutes
2014-11-08 15:23:17	@Espyo	I'd imagine so, eesh
2014-11-08 15:23:20	@Espyo	now try perfecting it
2014-11-08 15:23:23	@J	nope
2014-11-08 15:23:26	@Espyo	wasting 13 minutes of your life after each failed attempt
2014-11-08 15:23:36	@J	especially since the hardest is at the end

2014-11-08 21:12:02	@PikFan	alright so
2014-11-08 21:12:31	@PikFan	some things that I noticed in the short movies:
2014-11-08 21:12:44	@PikFan	1. Pikmin have hearts
2014-11-08 21:12:57	@PikFan	2. White Pikmin can spew a corrosive liquid
2014-11-08 21:13:13	@PikFan	both from the third movie
2014-11-08 21:14:32	@Espyo	ew, nasty
2014-11-08 21:14:36	@Espyo	I can't wait to see them
2014-11-08 21:14:41	@Espyo	but 5 is REALLY pricy
2014-11-08 21:14:51	@Espyo	people pay 5 to go watch a 2-hour movie
2014-11-08 21:14:57	@Espyo	at the cinema
2014-11-08 21:14:59	@PikFan	just wait till someone uploads them to the internet
2014-11-08 21:15:24	@Espyo	yeah, but that's no good either
2014-11-08 21:15:26	@Espyo	that's way too cheap
2014-11-08 21:15:31	@Espyo	I want to pay SOMETHING for them, I'm no crook
2014-11-08 21:15:46	@PikFan	uh-huh...
2014-11-08 21:16:05	@PikFan	*cough*downloads NPC P1 and P2 illegally*cough*

2014-11-08 21:16:18	@Espyo	I just go check their differences
2014-11-08 21:16:23	@Espyo	other than that, they pretty much don't exist for me
2014-11-08 21:16:48	@PikFan	I see
2014-11-08 21:16:58	@Espyo	anyway, I finally made a video with all sorts of enemy parameter crazinesses

2014-11-08 21:17:15	@PikFan	but yeah, my second point pretty much says that White Pikmin are acidic
2014-11-08 21:17:37	@PikFan	...poison is acidic?
2014-11-08 21:17:43	@PikFan	acid is poisonous?

2014-11-08 21:19:18	@Espyo	 5 doesn't-matters
2014-11-08 21:19:25	@J	5 potatoes, then
2014-11-08 21:19:28	@Espyo	the shorts are $5, £5 and 5€
2014-11-08 21:19:29	Testyo	$ 5 = 3.686 € / £ 3.1525

2014-11-08 21:19:37	Testyo	£ 4.49 = 5.25016 € / $ 7.12159 
2014-11-08 21:19:52	@Espyo	see, I'd pay 3€ for the shorts
2014-11-08 21:19:52	Testyo	3 € = £ 2.5656  / $ 4.0692 
2014-11-08 21:19:59	@Espyo	if they really DO cost $5, which they do
2014-11-08 21:20:00	Testyo	$ 5 = 3.686 € / £ 3.1525 
2014-11-08 21:20:06	@Espyo	I'd gladly pay 3€, the corresponding amount in Euro
2014-11-08 21:20:07	Testyo	3 € = £ 2.5656  / $ 4.0692

2014-11-10 12:31:07	Yoshi2	something tells me that maths is done in such a way that you have to fail your way through it before you get it

2014-11-10 12:35:58	@Espyo	and that is even if you have the foundations before you start
2014-11-10 12:36:14	@Espyo	like, when I entered college, everybody assumed I had trigonometry

2014-11-10 15:03:28	@Espyo	oh, wait
2014-11-10 15:03:34	@Espyo	on the arena is the Beady Long Legs
2014-11-10 15:03:38	@Espyo	the Snagrets are on the outer ring
2014-11-10 15:03:42	@Espyo	I think it's only one Snagret though

2014-11-10 15:54:04	Yoshi2	silly nintendo, using values that confuse me
2014-11-10 15:54:57	Yoshi2	0xC6 is an event that causes the parser to return to a specific point, and it often appears in a 0x9C volume event
2014-11-10 15:54:58	Testyo	9 C = 48.2 °F / 282.15 K
2014-11-10 15:57:21	@Espyo	heh
2014-11-10 15:57:44	Yoshi2	I am currently looking whether the 0xC6 event really has no arguments at all
2014-11-10 15:58:07	Yoshi2	because there is evidence that after 0xC6 follows one byte
2014-11-10 15:58:43	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-10 16:00:03	Yoshi2	wait
2014-11-10 16:00:30	Yoshi2	I did read one byte when parsing 0xC6 in the other file
2014-11-10 16:00:48	Yoshi2	I guess I forgot that detail when I ported the parsing over to the new code
2014-11-10 16:02:24	Yoshi2	yep, I did

2014-11-10 16:07:09	Yoshi2	obviously, it fails
2014-11-10 16:08:00	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-11-10 16:10:33	Yoshi2	it fails less when I use the SMS parser, which means that I left something in the SMS parser that should be in the Pik1 parser
2014-11-10 16:13:15	@Espyo	luckily you have leads
2014-11-10 16:15:03	Yoshi2	I have very little ways to verify that I am parsing data correctly
2014-11-10 16:16:06	Yoshi2	but if I read a note event, and it has a polyphonic ID bigger than or equal to 8, I am very likely reading data wrong
2014-11-10 16:17:05	Yoshi2	which is how I can see if something goes horribly wrong
2014-11-10 16:18:32	Yoshi2	sometimes there are exceptions to this rule
2014-11-10 16:18:49	@Espyo	hehe
2014-11-10 16:20:37	Yoshi2	well, pikmin 1 parses mostly well
2014-11-10 16:20:44	Yoshi2	with the exception of some known issues
2014-11-10 16:20:50	Yoshi2	such as that file with "se" in the name
2014-11-10 16:21:27	Yoshi2	the sysevent file, and demobgm (which contains that command event for debug text)
2014-11-10 16:23:15	Yoshi2	which means I can continue with wind waker testing
2014-11-10 16:23:30	Yoshi2	and then comes pikmin 2
2014-11-10 16:27:05	Yoshi2	lots of success, but a bit of failure
2014-11-10 16:27:10	Yoshi2	I'm missing one event

2014-11-10 20:27:12	Spark	also, i've heard that supposedly any solution that uses multiple inheritance can/should be solved in other ways
2014-11-10 20:34:03	Spark	honestly, it seems like i cant do anything besides have a global variable. that's the logical solution, but everyone says i should never need to use them, so i'm rather conflicted.
2014-11-10 20:35:03	@Espyo	probably just normal inheritance
2014-11-10 20:35:25	@Espyo	then again, you wouldn't suggest multiple inheritance that way
2014-11-10 20:35:26	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-11-10 20:35:37	@Espyo	no, but I really think normal inheritance is the way to go
2014-11-10 20:35:43	@Espyo	unless you're really doing something criss-cross
2014-11-10 20:37:48	Spark	well
2014-11-10 20:37:59	Spark	they're already inheriting from other classes beforehand
2014-11-10 20:38:09	Spark	so the inheritance would have to be multiple

2014-11-11 13:17:48	@Espyo	woah, how did you even do it, Miles?
2014-11-11 13:17:50	@Espyo	assembly edit?
2014-11-11 13:18:10	Yoshi2	Espyo: do what?
2014-11-11 13:21:15	Miles	Um, I'm not editing the trigger
2014-11-11 13:21:29	Miles	I'm placing an object that has the same size as the trigger
2014-11-11 13:21:49	Miles	Hence it being a random block from Chozo Ruins
2014-11-11 13:26:15	@Espyo	right, but what about the text that shows what the next room is?
2014-11-11 13:26:20	@Espyo	Yoshi2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrCf2ZGL6E0
2014-11-11 13:30:08	Yoshi2	I am not quite sure what I am seeing there
2014-11-11 13:30:12	Miles	All I'm doing is editing the list of objects in the room
2014-11-11 13:30:41	Miles	The text is a HUD Memo object that plays when I touch the "load" trigger

2014-11-11 13:36:49	Yoshi2	I'll try to get rid of any "dead" BMS events, i.e. BMS events that might not be events at all
2014-11-11 13:37:45	Yoshi2	for that, I'll write my test parsing code in such a way that it uses the parser for each game and puts out which events it has not encountered
2014-11-11 13:43:49	@Espyo	oh, fair enough
2014-11-11 13:44:11	@Espyo	hm, as long as you really don't need those events later
2014-11-11 13:44:56	Yoshi2	if it happens that I need one of the events, I will investiage it and add them again
2014-11-11 13:45:26	Yoshi2	it is good if the program fails due to unknown events
2014-11-11 13:45:31	Yoshi2	those BMS files are huuuuge
2014-11-11 13:45:48	Yoshi2	so if the program fails, it will put out the offset and I can look at it closer

2014-11-11 14:17:16	Yoshi2	it makes sense to remove a few events more than less to cause it to fail
2014-11-11 14:17:37	@Espyo	yeah, it does
2014-11-11 14:38:02	Yoshi2	I'll be leaving again, see you later

2014-11-11 15:36:21	Testyo	i can't find it now

2014-11-12 15:39:41	Yoshi2	interestingly, the SMS parser still works fine

2014-11-12 16:32:51	Yoshi2	I really hope the desync issues in playing BMS files is caused by me parsing some data incorrectly

2014-11-13 19:42:23	Klemen702	Hello
2014-11-13 19:42:46	Yoshi2	good day
2014-11-13 19:44:30	@J	hi
2014-11-13 20:01:22	@Espyo	hi

2014-11-13 20:12:17	Klemen702	it seems i have broken yet another gamecube controller, this one being third-party
2014-11-13 20:13:59	@Espyo	that sucks
2014-11-13 20:14:01	@Espyo	how?
2014-11-13 20:14:59	Klemen702	well i don't know much, infact it worked fine at first
2014-11-13 20:15:16	Klemen702	and then all of the sudden the joystick got weird
2014-11-13 20:15:47	Klemen702	while it is still usable, most of the time when i play a game the character goes slowly down
2014-11-13 20:16:43	Klemen702	or if i push the joystick up for enough time the character will do the same except with the up direction, but after a few movements it goes back to normal
2014-11-13 20:17:15	@Espyo	oh, that really is broken
2014-11-13 20:17:43	@Espyo	if you hold a direction before starting the console, the console thinks that direction is default
2014-11-13 20:17:49	@Espyo	but that's not the same according to what you're saying
2014-11-13 20:18:32	Klemen702	atleast it's better then my other joystick broken controller, that one just keeps leaning to the right which makes it more unplayable
2014-11-13 20:19:54	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-13 20:20:00	@Espyo	J: you didn't give me your opinion on the KopPad theme

2014-11-13 20:27:54	Evilmanimani	hi there
2014-11-13 20:27:54	@Espyo	actually yeah, I was just talking about my tentative KopPad theme
2014-11-13 20:28:01	@Espyo	good thing you're a designer, 'cause I'm not
2014-11-13 20:28:24	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/KopPad%20theme.png
2014-11-13 20:28:27	Evilmanimani	ok cool. KopPad theme for what? the whole site?
2014-11-13 20:28:52	Evilmanimani	oh ok, I see
2014-11-13 20:29:16	Evilmanimani	hmm that could be cool
2014-11-13 20:29:35	Evilmanimani	it'd be nice to incorporate some additional nature-y stuff too
2014-11-13 20:29:49	Evilmanimani	like a blend of what you have now and the koppad idea
2014-11-13 20:29:59	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-13 20:30:20	Evilmanimani	do you have a download for the Pikmin in-game typeface?
2014-11-13 20:30:46	Evilmanimani	and also, I've never designed for a wiki before - is there a template for the images involved?
2014-11-13 20:31:47	@Espyo	I've made one for the engine, using textures from the game, but ripped
2014-11-13 20:31:55	@Espyo	hmm, not quite sure if there is a template, to be honest
2014-11-13 20:31:58	@Espyo	but then again, there are no images
2014-11-13 20:32:03	@Espyo	all of this is imageless CSS

2014-11-13 20:33:00	@Espyo	they're in texture format, not any "normal" font format
2014-11-13 20:33:42	Evilmanimani	oh ok, could I have the 1 & 2 fonts then?

2014-11-13 20:37:59	@J	did you copy colours exactly or something?
2014-11-13 20:38:14	@Espyo	most of them, yeah
2014-11-13 20:38:44	Evilmanimani	also, I wanted to ask, on the Pikmin merchandise page it says the Pikmin 2 Gamecube bundle comes with a Pikmin themed controller. is that true? http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Merchandise
2014-11-13 20:39:06	@J	my first impression is that it looks okay
2014-11-13 20:39:12	@Espyo	do note that we aren't meant to use wikia any more
2014-11-13 20:39:17	Evilmanimani	sorry, oops
2014-11-13 20:39:18	@J	I turned off Redshift and I'll let you know how the colours look in a few minutes
2014-11-13 20:39:19	@Espyo	even linking to it causes more damage than good
2014-11-13 20:39:19	Evilmanimani	I meant http://www.pikminwiki.com/Merchandise
2014-11-13 20:39:20	@Espyo	it's ok
2014-11-13 20:39:29	@Espyo	anyway, I'm not quite sure about that
2014-11-13 20:39:29	@J	you can also do [[Merchandise]]
2014-11-13 20:39:30	Testyo	"Merchandise" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Merchandise
2014-11-13 20:39:43	@Espyo	never heard of it, but there's an image, so I'm guessing it's legit
2014-11-13 20:39:46	@Espyo	probably Japan-only
2014-11-13 20:39:51	Evilmanimani	it is JP only
2014-11-13 20:40:03	Evilmanimani	the picture is really small and you can't make out if the controller has any additional printing on it
2014-11-13 20:40:08	@Espyo	urgh, that Engrish on the article
2014-11-13 20:40:13	@Espyo	yeah, you're right
2014-11-13 20:40:17	@Espyo	let me try a reverse google search
2014-11-13 20:40:25	@Espyo	whoever added that must've picked a really low image
2014-11-13 20:40:27	Evilmanimani	somebody on reddit mentioned it was just a regular Emerald Blue controller
2014-11-13 20:40:39	Evilmanimani	I think it's the only image out there... I was googling earlier and couldn't find anything
2014-11-13 20:41:08	@J	I don't know what CSS you used to do the BGs, but I'd probably check it works on IE
2014-11-13 20:41:09	Klemen702	brb
2014-11-13 20:41:13	@J	or just have images too
2014-11-13 20:41:27	@Espyo	oh, the BG is an image
2014-11-13 20:41:30	@J	oh
2014-11-13 20:41:35	@Espyo	ugh, IE... I almost forgot
2014-11-13 20:41:37	@J	okay
2014-11-13 20:41:40	@Espyo	every bit of CSS is very simple there
2014-11-13 20:41:47	@Espyo	but even still I bet it won't work on IE flawlessly

2014-11-13 20:42:04	@J	so the thing I like the least is background on the ToC/infobox
2014-11-13 20:42:12	@J	it's a bit too noisy, distracts from the text
2014-11-13 20:42:36	@J	I think it's mostly the vertical lines

2014-11-13 20:43:11	@J	the colour scheme is decent overall, though you have to be very careful when changing body text colour
2014-11-13 20:43:16	@Espyo	<J> so the thing I like the least is background on the ToC/infobox
2014-11-13 20:43:19	@Espyo	that's definitely my main gripe too
2014-11-13 20:43:22	Evilmanimani	wtf weird stuff espyo
2014-11-13 20:43:24	@J	look at _lots_ of pages to see if any depend on the body text being darker than the BG
2014-11-13 20:43:33	@Espyo	yeah, some stuff breaks
2014-11-13 20:43:41	@Espyo	like on search results, a white box with links has everything white
2014-11-13 20:43:46	@PikFan	...what
2014-11-13 20:43:46	@Espyo	still need to fix some kinks

2014-11-13 20:44:36	@Espyo	but it really looks true
2014-11-13 20:44:47	@Espyo	some things have REALLY poor info...
2014-11-13 20:44:49	Evilmanimani	do you guys know any JP pikmin fans?
2014-11-13 20:44:55	@Espyo	like the e-reader games, I'd love it if we had more info on that
2014-11-13 20:44:58	@Espyo	nope, not really
2014-11-13 20:45:08	@J	I thought the logo worked surprisingly well, but it's not quite as good without Redshift
2014-11-13 20:45:09	@J	not bad, though
2014-11-13 20:45:30	@Espyo	oh, that image is a bit outdated about the logo
2014-11-13 20:45:40	@Espyo	I didn't change much, only this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Wiki.png
2014-11-13 20:45:42	@PikFan	Is that KopPad themed?
2014-11-13 20:45:43	@Espyo	it's cozy
2014-11-13 20:45:46	@Espyo	yep, it is
2014-11-13 20:45:55	@PikFan	Thought so
2014-11-13 20:46:26	@J	I would consider switching link/body text colours, see how it looks
2014-11-13 20:46:42	@Espyo	yeah, I'll try
2014-11-13 20:46:42	@PikFan	At first glance it looked like you were trying to copy Zelda Wiki, due to the similar colors 
2014-11-13 20:46:45	Evilmanimani	would the KopPad theme replace this current one or just be an alternate?
2014-11-13 20:46:56	@Espyo	just an alt
2014-11-13 20:47:45	@PikFan	So my iPad is being dumb and won't let me open Pages

2014-11-13 20:48:39	@J	oh, what does the edit page look like?
2014-11-13 20:48:47	@PikFan	Mhm
2014-11-13 20:48:49	@J	if the text box is still white, might look odd
2014-11-13 20:48:56	@Espyo	it did look odd
2014-11-13 20:49:13	@PikFan	Also, last night I started brainstorming ideas for my extra gameplay modes I my fan game

2014-11-13 20:50:32	Evilmanimani	cool pikfan is there a place I can read about your fan game?
2014-11-13 20:50:40	Evilmanimani	is it for pikmin 1 or 2?
2014-11-13 20:50:57	@J	you know, I think I actually prefer the green logo
2014-11-13 20:51:10	@PikFan	One of my ideas is like you have to accomplish certain tasks in a time limit
2014-11-13 20:51:14	@Espyo	I'm indifferent about the logo
2014-11-13 20:51:50	@PikFan	Another one is the classic collect treasure
2014-11-13 20:52:18	@J	hmm
2014-11-13 20:52:26	@PikFan	Also, I'm considering moving some of the upgrade treasures to the challenge mode
2014-11-13 20:52:29	@J	okay, first, I would aim to have all text inputs the same colour scheme
2014-11-13 20:52:53	@PikFan	Evilmanimani: on pikminfanon.com
2014-11-13 20:52:54	@J	second, the contrast is a bit low on the edit box
2014-11-13 20:53:07	@PikFan	Look up Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds
2014-11-13 20:53:18	Evilmanimani	ty PikFan
2014-11-13 20:53:22	@J	pre is nice
2014-11-13 20:53:22	@Espyo	I'll try changing it
2014-11-13 20:53:30	Evilmanimani	is there a place to download the sound effects/music from pikmin 3?
2014-11-13 20:53:32	@Espyo	pre was easy: dark with like half alpha
2014-11-13 20:53:38	@Espyo	nobody ripped them yet
2014-11-13 20:53:44	@Espyo	but GilvaSunner ripped the music
2014-11-13 20:53:47	@Espyo	or... recorded
2014-11-13 20:53:53	@Espyo	probably not really a direct file rip
2014-11-13 20:54:05	@PikFan	Why is the Wii U so hard to hack
2014-11-13 20:54:25	@Espyo	more like why is the Wii so easy to hack

2014-11-13 20:55:16	Evilmanimani	holy crap PikFan! this game looks immense
2014-11-13 20:55:20	Evilmanimani	very cool
2014-11-13 20:55:44	@PikFan	...they're arguing AGAIN?
2014-11-13 20:56:01	@J	uh...how long has the edit box been transparent with the current skin?
2014-11-13 20:56:23	@PikFan	Okay I've got these three girls FIGHTING over me

2014-11-13 20:57:34	@J	if you get a better version of the grid background, could try that in the edit box
2014-11-13 20:57:46	@PikFan	...now they're fighting over someone else
2014-11-13 20:57:53	@J	I would suggest making all vertical lines dotted, and reducing contrast

2014-11-13 20:59:14	@Espyo	oh, and I see that red text all the time, so I just ignore it
2014-11-13 20:59:16	@Espyo	ow, my head
2014-11-13 21:01:10	@J	another suggestion: change all the rounded borders to be fully rounded (not just 2 corners) and to have a smaller radius (looks like that would match KopPad better)
2014-11-13 21:01:43	@Espyo	the roundedness is pretty nilly-willy
2014-11-13 21:01:59	@Espyo	though I think big roundness looks nice on the buttons
2014-11-13 21:02:03	@Espyo	like the ones under the search box
2014-11-13 21:02:19	@J	well, KopPad buttons are circle, so...

2014-11-13 21:03:01	@J	but yeah, more the page/sitenotice/tabs/user links could have less radius
2014-11-13 21:03:14	@J	looks like you already did it with toc/sidebar
2014-11-13 21:04:18	@J	how does it look if the sidebar boxes don't have a left border, they just go off the page?
2014-11-13 21:04:23	@J	same for footer, on both sides
2014-11-13 21:04:41	@J	(but not main content - it should have a maximum width of like 900px)
2014-11-13 21:04:50	@J	(maybe 1000)
2014-11-13 21:05:05	@J	ooh, you missed the bullet points
2014-11-13 21:05:27	@J	they probably don't need to be images, just white dots or something
2014-11-13 21:05:41	@J	okay, I gave you enough feedback now
2014-11-13 21:07:32	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-13 21:08:04	@Espyo	hm, I'll give the "go off the page" thing a try
2014-11-13 21:08:12	@Espyo	that probably works on loads of themes
2014-11-13 21:10:15	Klemen702	back
2014-11-13 21:12:50	@Espyo	wb
2014-11-13 21:13:09	Klemen702	thanks
2014-11-13 21:36:51	@J	so I'm making a Dustforce level
2014-11-13 21:36:52	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/dustforce%20level.mkv
2014-11-13 21:37:08	@J	still in progress, but I kind of like it
2014-11-13 21:37:16	@J	I need a name, though
2014-11-13 21:37:30	@J	(and also a start and end)
2014-11-13 21:43:24	@Espyo	level design really is fun, isn't it?
2014-11-13 21:43:44	Klemen702	making fanfiction levels?
2014-11-13 21:44:56	@Espyo	hmm, that one looks like a bit of a bitch to 100%
2014-11-13 21:44:57	Testyo	You swear like a sailor.
2014-11-13 21:45:01	@Espyo	either that or you just did a poor run
2014-11-13 21:45:04	@Espyo	I really don't, Testyo
2014-11-13 21:45:05	Testyo	well, there was another background image, but another admin changed it because it made the images I ripped didn't look as good
2014-11-13 21:45:28	@Espyo	not a fan of 0:30
2014-11-13 21:45:47	@Espyo	the level flows well in that it doesn't look much like a linear path, but it just looks like a structure with paths
2014-11-13 21:45:48	@Espyo	that's good
2014-11-13 21:45:55	@Espyo	but 0:30 is REALLY jarring because it's so different
2014-11-13 21:46:00	@Espyo	you very clearly have to do that
2014-11-13 21:46:04	@Espyo	I mean, you can't really do anything else
2014-11-13 21:46:11	@Espyo	but I don't know, add some variety on their heights, at least?
2014-11-13 21:49:55	@J	it's not really that hard
2014-11-13 21:50:13	@J	it's not like I was doing lots of runs, that's just the first one I got when recording
2014-11-13 21:50:24	@J	not hard compared to lots of custom/stock maps
2014-11-13 21:51:32	@J	hmm
2014-11-13 21:51:53	@J	the paths for all the other stuff is actually quite obvious
2014-11-13 21:52:08	@J	probably moreso for people who've played the game a lot
2014-11-13 21:52:23	@J	I see what you're saying, but that's a thing I wanted to do
2014-11-13 21:52:36	@J	first, it's the hardest part if you're not going for 100%
2014-11-13 21:52:48	@J	second, I'm going to put an easter egg in the big pit
2014-11-13 21:53:49	Klemen702	well i gtg
2014-11-13 21:53:50	@J	I haven't done any decoration/ambience adjustment yet, but I want to try to make it feel you're really going deep underground by making it darker and quieter
2014-11-13 21:53:53	@J	bye
2014-11-13 21:53:54	Klemen702	bye guys

2014-11-13 21:54:19	@J	and contrast that with the short forest sections before/after, which will be really bright and sunny
2014-11-13 21:54:25	@J	forest with random lab in the middle of it
2014-11-13 21:55:12	@J	all the parts from the entrance at the start to the tunnel at the end will have a background to look like they're inside
2014-11-13 21:55:55	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-11-13 21:57:25	@J	but yeah, name it
2014-11-13 21:57:30	@J	or give me ideas
2014-11-13 22:01:30	@Espyo	too early to name
2014-11-13 22:02:26	@J	...in the day?
2014-11-13 22:06:02	@Espyo	huh?
2014-11-13 22:06:14	@Espyo	I think your plans are still to early for a name
2014-11-13 22:06:24	@Espyo	not that I think nighttime is too early to name stuff
2014-11-13 22:07:21	@J	hmm
2014-11-13 22:07:42	@J	yeah, I guess names usually come from the mood/aesthetic rather than the mechanics/flow
2014-11-13 22:07:48	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-13 22:07:52	@J	nice excuse for being lazy
2014-11-13 22:07:56	@Espyo	comes from the whole package, really
2014-11-13 22:08:03	@Espyo	not lazy, just avoiding duplicate work
2014-11-13 22:08:07	@Espyo	that's what you call efficient
2014-11-13 22:11:39	@J	it's not duplicate effort if I'm only going to bother to try if you don't
2014-11-13 22:12:12	@Espyo	I will, but only latr
2014-11-13 22:12:14	@Espyo	*later
2014-11-13 22:12:20	@Espyo	it's duplicate effort if I try for a name now and again later
2014-11-13 22:13:55	@J	your thinking is twisted
2014-11-13 22:26:29	@Espyo	but correct

2014-11-14 17:36:52	Klemen702	appearently the decorative goo has the treasure hoard number 64, and not only that, it is also a mario item, should this be added in the trivia? Nintendo did make alot of Nintendo 64 refrences while working on gamecube games (a great example of this is paper mario TTYD)

2014-11-14 17:39:42	@Espyo	oh, I never noticed it was number 64
2014-11-14 17:39:49	@Espyo	yeah, I guess it's more than just a coincidence
2014-11-14 17:40:12	Klemen702	ok i will add it

2014-11-15 12:24:26	Yoshi2	morning Espyo & Testyo 
2014-11-15 12:24:27	Testyo	damn the off screen though
2014-11-15 12:26:36	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-15 12:27:31	Yoshi2	even though Testyo has test in his name, I'd say he is anything but a test
2014-11-15 12:27:32	Testyo	we have textures all over the concept of classes there
2014-11-15 12:29:21	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2014-11-15 12:29:23	@Espyo	well, he was
2014-11-15 12:29:25	@Espyo	back in the day
2014-11-15 12:30:11	Yoshi2	thinking up new names is hard
2014-11-15 12:30:42	Yoshi2	I started calling my own bots by the name of one of my alt accounts in a mmorpg game
2014-11-15 12:30:56	@Espyo	simple enough
2014-11-15 12:31:01	@Espyo	Testyo was easy
2014-11-15 12:31:02	Testyo	you pissed me off for, for instance, being against other people, flaming, etc.
2014-11-15 12:31:05	@Espyo	obviously started as test
2014-11-15 12:31:16	@Espyo	but I realized that if he's joining a channel, might as well be something like Testy
2014-11-15 12:31:26	@J	[12:31:01] @Espyo Testyo was easy
2014-11-15 12:31:26	@J	[12:31:02] Testyo you pissed me off
2014-11-15 12:31:27	@Espyo	and then I realized I should add an o to resemble my EspYO
2014-11-15 12:31:28	Testyo	they in Pikipedia isn't as impacting
2014-11-15 12:31:28	@Espyo	so boom
2014-11-15 12:31:29	Testyo	it's the one I am currently working on it
2014-11-15 12:31:36	@Espyo	how did I miss that
2014-11-15 12:32:25	Yoshi2	you pissed Testyo off by being against other people
2014-11-15 12:32:26	Testyo	or 0.035 'units' the electricity company charges you could sort them
2014-11-15 12:32:27	Yoshi2	and flaming
2014-11-15 12:32:29	@Espyo	some other things I had to name went really well too
2014-11-15 12:32:32	@Espyo	like PK Rhythm
2014-11-15 12:32:42	@Espyo	simple, explanatory, short (short enough), catchy
2014-11-15 12:34:10	@Espyo	and then we have things like "Pikmin fangame engine"
2014-11-15 12:36:09	Yoshi2	there is a pikmin fangame engine?
2014-11-15 12:36:28	@Espyo	yeah

2014-11-15 12:40:52	Yoshi2	that sounds like quite a bit of work
2014-11-15 12:41:14	Yoshi2	"instead of just programming it, we could just write stuff on text files."
2014-11-15 12:41:24	Yoshi2	... but that's programming?
2014-11-15 12:42:26	@Espyo	hehe
2014-11-15 12:42:32	@Espyo	no, I mean the uh... "final user"
2014-11-15 12:42:34	@Espyo	instead of writing code
2014-11-15 12:42:37	@Espyo	it's just a config file
2014-11-15 12:42:39	@Espyo	not really the same
2014-11-15 12:43:52	Yoshi2	I thought so much
2014-11-15 12:44:18	Yoshi2	writing stuff on text files is so vague, it could be both :>
2014-11-15 12:44:22	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-15 12:45:30	Yoshi2	what does the engine look like at the moment?
2014-11-15 12:49:32	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/sticky.gif like this
2014-11-15 12:49:37	@Espyo	this is the most recent gif I have on my dropbox
2014-11-15 12:49:44	@Espyo	except it's nighttime in that gif
2014-11-15 12:51:42	Yoshi2	ah, that does look decent enough
2014-11-15 12:53:49	Yoshi2	it does feel a bit odd that the pikmin are moving in static circles around the player until they hit the wall
2014-11-15 12:55:19	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-15 12:55:20	Yoshi2	the collision detection looks good though
2014-11-15 12:55:22	@Espyo	it's hard to make them fluid
2014-11-15 12:55:25	@Espyo	maybe in the future
2014-11-15 12:55:29	@Espyo	looks good, but sticky
2014-11-15 12:55:41	@Espyo	again, that's just a random gif I recorded because I found the stickiness funny
2014-11-15 12:55:48	@Espyo	the rest of the collisions are perfectly fine

2014-11-15 13:02:27	Yoshi2	my alarm bells are ringing when I read "se"
2014-11-15 13:03:43	@Espyo	hah
2014-11-15 13:03:54	@Espyo	yeah, a character in console outputs rings a bell

2014-11-15 13:06:04	Yoshi2	hm, yes

2014-11-15 13:08:28	Yoshi2	(the extended ascii character table on that page is silly, though. ASCII only includes the characters from 0 to 127)
2014-11-15 13:21:59	Yoshi2	alright, I think I managed to fix the issues I had yesterday
2014-11-15 13:24:32	@Espyo	good
2014-11-15 13:34:57	Yoshi2	this is what one entry can look like: http://pastebin.com/Pvq5GDE1
2014-11-15 13:46:34	Yoshi2	now I'll run this for every BMS command, wish me luck
2014-11-15 13:46:50	@Espyo	you're gonna need it
2014-11-15 13:46:53	@Espyo	good luck
2014-11-15 13:47:21	@Espyo	all right, how can we know what the current Pikmin 2 WR is?
2014-11-15 13:47:33	@Espyo	I'm not sure if HSS0136 just broke it
2014-11-15 13:47:48	Yoshi2	what do you mean with current WR?
2014-11-15 13:48:48	@Espyo	the current world record
2014-11-15 13:48:51	@Espyo	uh, any record, I guess
2014-11-15 13:48:57	@Espyo	debt or 100%, SS or segmented
2014-11-15 13:49:13	@Espyo	I mean, the only thing that's really recorded is Speed Demos Archive
2014-11-15 13:49:18	@Espyo	it's probably outdated for a few years
2014-11-15 13:49:31	Yoshi2	ah, I see
2014-11-15 13:50:12	@Espyo	I really wonder if we'll ever get a Pikmin 2 TAS
2014-11-15 13:50:22	@Espyo	with luck manipulation for perfect caves and everything...
2014-11-15 13:52:03	Yoshi2	that would be interesting
2014-11-15 13:55:19	Yoshi2	if there was a way to know how the RNG worked, what the caves depended on and what the state of the seed for the RNG is at any given time, you could probably think something up
2014-11-15 13:57:28	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-11-15 13:57:42	@Espyo	looks like the RNG only depends on time
2014-11-15 13:57:51	@Espyo	at least for what you get outside of eggs
2014-11-15 13:57:54	@Espyo	*inside eggs
2014-11-15 14:00:41	Yoshi2	if it only depends on time, you could TAS it quite well
2014-11-15 14:01:07	Yoshi2	would be very difficult though
2014-11-15 14:02:00	Yoshi2	it requires some hard planning
2014-11-15 14:03:59	Yoshi2	it looks like what I just did worked
2014-11-15 14:04:09	Yoshi2	60 MB of text files
2014-11-15 14:05:48	Yoshi2	it's good that I sorted it per game and BMS command
2014-11-15 14:06:21	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-15 14:08:17	Yoshi2	if I were to ignore specific BMS commands, I could cut total size down by a lot
2014-11-15 14:08:44	Yoshi2	but that's not important right now
2014-11-15 14:09:48	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-15 14:16:40	Yoshi2	the BMS format has such as thing called "polyphonic IDs", where notes can be enabled with different polyphonic IDs
2014-11-15 14:17:12	Yoshi2	instead of deactivating notes specifically, there are 8 BMS events for turning off all notes with a specific polyphonic ID
2014-11-15 14:17:31	Yoshi2	and it looks like pikmin 1 uses the first two IDs the most
2014-11-15 14:18:19	Yoshi2	just interesting to note
2014-11-15 14:20:45	Yoshi2	the top ten of the most used events in Pikmin 1 consist of those which I know how to parse
2014-11-15 14:20:49	Yoshi2	which could be a good thing

2014-11-15 14:29:09	@Espyo	hm, neat
2014-11-15 14:30:09	Yoshi2	not that it makes work better because even one occurence of an odd event can ruin everything
2014-11-15 14:30:18	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-15 14:30:19	@Espyo	but still
2014-11-15 14:33:14	Yoshi2	it does mean the SMS guy did good work identifying the purpose of the most commonly used events

2014-11-15 14:56:57	Yoshi2	plenty of work ahead of me, I guess
2014-11-15 14:57:11	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-11-15 14:59:49	Yoshi2	based off the names of the Pikmin 1 soundfiles, I could put a lot of conspiracy theories into the world
2014-11-15 15:01:00	Yoshi2	one of the files is called "play3.jam", ergo Pikmin 3 was planned 13 years ago!!!!
2014-11-15 15:03:07	@Espyo	lol
2014-11-15 15:04:43	Yoshi2	(it is more likely that they had a play1 and play2 file at some point which were renamed or removed)

2014-11-15 16:23:40	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2014-11-15 16:23:56	Yoshi2	"the problem is getting the Hi" -Testyo
2014-11-15 16:23:59	Testyo	im going to find some examples of glitches, and the guy found several of them
2014-11-15 16:24:03	Yoshi2	wise words
2014-11-15 16:26:24	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-15 16:28:31	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-15 16:28:37	@Espyo	so it's possible to complete Pikmin 2 without yellows, I see
2014-11-15 16:28:47	Yoshi2	really?
2014-11-15 16:28:48	@Espyo	all electrical hazards can be overcome with any other Pikmin
2014-11-15 16:28:56	@Espyo	all tall ledges can be glitched with
2014-11-15 16:29:07	@Espyo	and the only two electrical gates can apparently be overcome with glitches
2014-11-15 16:29:18	@Espyo	the guy goes around one of the gates in the speedrun I'm watching
2014-11-15 16:29:25	@Espyo	it was the only gate that still needed a workaround, afaik
2014-11-15 16:29:38	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-11-15 16:30:39	Yoshi2	I find it odd how white pikmins have an important role in Pikmin 2, but in Pikmin 3 they don't appear at all in the single player mode
2014-11-15 16:31:09	@Espyo	well, they're semi-important
2014-11-15 16:31:16	@Espyo	if it weren't for the digging mechanic, they'd be useless too
2014-11-15 16:31:23	@Espyo	Purples can destroy poison gates
2014-11-15 16:31:29	@Espyo	*poison pipes
2014-11-15 16:31:38	@Espyo	but yeah, they decided to favor new Pikmin instead
2014-11-15 16:31:46	@Espyo	makes sense — controlling 7 Pikmin types would drive anyone crazy
2014-11-15 16:32:19	Yoshi2	I find controlling several pikmin types in Pikmin 3 easier than in 2
2014-11-15 16:32:40	@Espyo	it is
2014-11-15 16:32:52	@Espyo	but even still, specially for casual players, keeping in control 7 types would be a burden
2014-11-15 16:33:49	Yoshi2	very possible
2014-11-15 16:36:15	Yoshi2	it's also funny how the poison gates are only regular gates with some poison gas outlets clipped into them

2014-11-15 16:43:53	@Espyo	oh, there are three electric gates in Pikmin 2, not two
2014-11-15 16:44:01	@Espyo	but the third one can ALSO be skipped, so meh
