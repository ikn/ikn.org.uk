2014-05-25 20:43:17	@PikFan	thanks J
2014-05-25 20:43:37	@Espyo	but apparently, either Ruin doesn't, or it removes WAY less cookies than it should
2014-05-25 20:43:50	@PikFan	well yeah, of course you'll lose less with Ruin than you win with Frenzy
2014-05-25 20:44:16	@PikFan	if you get a F+R, you'll lose... oh
2014-05-25 20:44:19	@PikFan	hold on
2014-05-25 20:44:29	@Espyo	I mean the opposite
2014-05-25 20:44:37	@PikFan	4,200 seconds of cookies
2014-05-25 20:44:38	@Espyo	I lose less with Ruin AND Frenzy than I do with Lucky alone
2014-05-25 20:44:47	@PikFan	...oh
2014-05-25 20:44:52	@PikFan	huh
2014-05-25 20:45:00	@Espyo	Frenzy + Ruin, lost 300 quad, Lucky, won 400 quad
2014-05-25 20:45:05	@Espyo	unless I misread something...
2014-05-25 20:46:05	@PikFan	...how many cookies are in your bank
2014-05-25 20:46:23	@Espyo	 6 quint
2014-05-25 20:46:28	@PikFan	hmm
2014-05-25 20:47:35	@PikFan	http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Cookie?useskin=monobook#Outcomes and http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Wrath_Cookie?useskin=monobook#Outcomes
2014-05-25 20:47:58	@PikFan	29 more ACs to go
2014-05-25 20:48:01	@Espyo	...thanks for being slow, windows
2014-05-25 20:48:08	@PikFan	almost cost 100 quint
2014-05-25 20:48:12	@PikFan	heh
2014-05-25 20:48:18	@Espyo	it took so long to open that page, that I decided to check CC
2014-05-25 20:48:22	@Espyo	and had a Golden Cookie vanishing
2014-05-25 20:48:24	@PikFan	windows harassing you again
2014-05-25 20:48:32	@Espyo	the second I click, BOOM, new tab in my face
2014-05-25 20:48:36	@Espyo	I go back to CC, the GC's gone
2014-05-25 20:48:52	@Espyo	this is only the 2nd harassment today
2014-05-25 20:48:54	@PikFan	ugh
2014-05-25 20:49:00	@Espyo	the first was that you can right-click the explorer icon on the taskbar
2014-05-25 20:49:05	@Espyo	and you can add jump lists
2014-05-25 20:49:09	@PikFan	which windows OS are you using
2014-05-25 20:49:09	@Espyo	which are just folders you visit often
2014-05-25 20:49:12	@PikFan	7?
2014-05-25 20:49:15	@Espyo	except it magically forgets them every once in a while
2014-05-25 20:49:17	@Espyo	 8
2014-05-25 20:49:21	@PikFan	...oh
2014-05-25 20:49:24	@PikFan	bah
2014-05-25 20:49:33	@PikFan	I don't like 8
2014-05-25 20:49:39	@PikFan	7 is better IMO
2014-05-25 20:49:58	@Espyo	same
2014-05-25 20:50:10	@Espyo	yeah, the wiki doesn't say anything about Ruin making you lose less
2014-05-25 20:50:18	@PikFan	...huh
2014-05-25 20:50:42	@Espyo	if you win CPS * 1200 with lucky
2014-05-25 20:50:49	@Espyo	and lose CPS * 600 with ruin
2014-05-25 20:51:12	@Espyo	and win CPS * 1200 * 7 with Frenzy
2014-05-25 20:51:24	@Espyo	and lose CPS * 600 * 7 with Frenzy + Ruin
2014-05-25 20:51:35	@Espyo	(I meant Frenzy + Lucky on the 3rd one)
2014-05-25 20:51:52	@Espyo	then F+R = CPS * 4200 lost
2014-05-25 20:52:03	@Espyo	and L, without F, = CPS * 1200 won
2014-05-25 20:52:15	@Espyo	so yeah, I should've lost WAY more with F+R than I won with L alone
2014-05-25 20:52:32	@PikFan	maybe you did misread something
2014-05-25 20:55:02	@PikFan	...oh wow
2014-05-25 20:55:15	@PikFan	apparently EF is more common than CF
2014-05-25 20:55:35	@Espyo	huh, good
2014-05-25 20:55:37	@PikFan	but I bet EF+R is rarer than CF+F
2014-05-25 20:55:38	@Espyo	also, dinner
2014-05-25 20:56:03	Mariofan169	I think you're complicating/over thinking a game about clicking a giant cookie
2014-05-25 20:56:15	@PikFan	no, we're not
2014-05-25 20:56:25	@PikFan	if you played it you'd understand
2014-05-25 20:57:22	@PikFan	woah
2014-05-25 20:57:34	@PikFan	CF+F would give me 690.801 quint
2014-05-25 21:19:48	@PikFan	wow
2014-05-25 21:20:02	@PikFan	frenzy + cookie chain
2014-05-25 21:20:13	@PikFan	went up to 77 quint

2014-05-26 18:50:38	@J	*/a
2014-05-26 18:50:42	@J	wait, it doesn't work like that
2014-05-26 19:13:27	@Espyo	gotta love the a
2014-05-26 19:13:46	@Espyo	all right, the Carmageddon wiki is finally moving from wikia to the official website
2014-05-26 19:13:57	@Espyo	several months ago, we tried moving from wikia to a fan site
2014-05-26 19:14:01	@Espyo	but we got stuck on the images
2014-05-26 19:14:12	@Espyo	how exactly did we migrate the images on Pikipedia from wikia?
2014-05-26 19:30:31	@J	I did it using a script that calls the MediaWiki API
2014-05-26 19:30:43	@Espyo	would you still have that lying around
2014-05-26 19:30:44	@Espyo	*?
2014-05-26 19:30:55	@J	it loses past versions and the original uploader
2014-05-26 19:30:57	@J	and date
2014-05-26 19:31:00	@J	but it kind of worked
2014-05-26 19:31:07	@J	hmm, probably
2014-05-26 19:31:19	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-05-26 19:31:27	@Espyo	wouldn't there be other scripts on the NIWA forums?
2014-05-26 19:32:39	@J	there was one, but I think it required DB access or something
2014-05-26 19:32:49	@J	it's probably still worth searching, though
2014-05-26 19:32:49	@Espyo	bleh
2014-05-26 19:36:28	@J	hmm, my stuff seems to be from an old version of my library thing, hopefully a consistent version is in Git history somewhere
2014-05-26 19:38:27	@J	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikn/python-modules/807492292b7f5cedfb89bd0ba2c4a8fe3ac964f6/mwbot.py
2014-05-26 19:38:34	@J	that may work
2014-05-26 19:38:39	@J	...maybe I should test it first
2014-05-26 19:39:35	@J	also need https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikn/python-modules/master/htmlparse.py and https://github.com/ikn/python-modules/blob/master/fetch.py
2014-05-26 19:39:59	@J	rather, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikn/python-modules/master/fetch.py
2014-05-26 19:42:02	@J	oh, apparently https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikn/python-modules/master/miscutil.py too, for some reason
2014-05-26 19:42:10	@J	and http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/
2014-05-26 19:42:47	@Espyo	...
2014-05-26 19:42:59	@Espyo	well, hopefully it'll work fine on windows
2014-05-26 19:43:08	@J	I've used it on Windows before
2014-05-26 19:46:52	@Espyo	I'll have to check later then
2014-05-26 19:50:10	@J	hmm?

2014-05-29 15:44:05	@Espyo	well, that was just... something
2014-05-29 15:44:15	@Espyo	to triangulate, there are parts where it has to find the rightmost vertex
2014-05-29 15:44:28	@Espyo	if there are two rightmost vertices, like at different Ys
2014-05-29 15:44:33	@Espyo	it picks the first one it finds
2014-05-29 15:44:43	@Espyo	except... for some reason I'm still not sure of, it was randomly picking the second
2014-05-29 15:44:48	@Espyo	maybe it wasn't ordering the same every time
2014-05-29 15:45:01	@Espyo	but it's fine, because either vertex that is at the right works... right?
2014-05-29 15:45:07	@Espyo	well, that's the theory, but everything kept breaking
2014-05-29 15:45:19	@Espyo	so I just made it also check for equal Xs, and if so, pick the lowest Y
2014-05-29 15:45:24	@Espyo	and now everything's working
2014-05-29 15:45:33	@Espyo	and I'm not pleased by this fix because I didn't learn the problem
2014-05-29 15:45:46	@Espyo	and worse: I just now it's gonna rear its ugly head again later
2014-05-29 15:46:03	@Espyo	long story short: for the nth time, do NOT use polygon-based geometry

2014-05-29 19:12:22	@J	maybe it's just you
2014-05-29 19:21:16	@Espyo	oh, and now that I've worked on it all day
2014-05-29 19:21:22	@Espyo	I fixed it... by doing not even sure what
2014-05-29 19:21:34	@Espyo	also, when checking if a point is inside a triangle, which you need to do
2014-05-29 19:21:44	@Espyo	there's this thing with the point being on the left or right side of each line
2014-05-29 19:21:47	@Espyo	but there's also the edge case, at 0
2014-05-29 19:21:56	@Espyo	and for the weirdest reason, that I still don't know
2014-05-29 19:22:12	@Espyo	sometimes, it needs to check less or equal to accept an edge-case as "inside"
2014-05-29 19:22:18	@Espyo	and other times it needs to check just less, to accept it
2014-05-29 19:28:36	@J	it wouldn't really make a difference, would it?
2014-05-29 19:29:39	@Espyo	suppose you have a square
2014-05-29 19:29:43	@Espyo	triangulated, that's obvious two triangles
2014-05-29 19:29:48	@Espyo	with a diagonal straight across the middle
2014-05-29 19:30:05	@Espyo	if you click on the exact center, if the "less or equal" thing isn't done right, it won't count as being part of either triangle
2014-05-29 19:32:45	@J	hmm
2014-05-29 19:32:58	@J	I wouldn't count on <=, though, for floats
2014-05-29 19:33:33	@J	I'd probably try to calculate distances and then use the minimum instead, or enlarge each triangle a little before the check
2014-05-29 19:34:58	@Espyo	but these are potentially thousands of triangles
2014-05-29 19:35:02	@Espyo	so I'd rather keep it simple
2014-05-29 19:35:10	@Espyo	but of course, I see what you mean
2014-05-29 19:35:22	@Espyo	either way, I'd rather not deviate too much from the ear clip algorithm
2014-05-29 19:35:30	@Espyo	or else if I ever have to come back, I won't understand a thing
2014-05-29 19:35:47	@Espyo	plus I've been head-to-head with this for days now, I just don't care about having to manually pick <= or =
2014-05-29 19:35:52	@Espyo	*<= or <
2014-05-29 19:36:02	@Espyo	it's weird too, because
2014-05-29 19:36:13	@Espyo	to check which triangle is being clicked on, it only detects edge-cases with <=
2014-05-29 19:36:48	@Espyo	but to detect if a vertex is on the edge of a triangle, it has to be <
2014-05-29 19:37:03	@Espyo	I just don't know, and I really can't care any more
2014-05-29 19:54:07	@J	except that you'll get floating-point errors even if you pick the 'right' operators
2014-05-29 19:56:34	@Espyo	well yeah, but regardless, it looks like it works
2014-05-29 19:56:35	@Espyo	so...
2014-05-29 19:56:59	@Espyo	I might still go with ints in the future, regardless
2014-05-29 19:57:02	@Espyo	but for now...

2014-05-29 20:39:03	@PikFan	.
2014-05-29 20:39:10	@PikFan	I'm sick
2014-05-29 20:39:22	@PikFan	got the cold, I think
2014-05-29 20:40:05	@Espyo	I get a stuffy nose when I wake up for the past week or so
2014-05-29 20:40:09	@Espyo	then it's fine throughout the day
2014-05-29 20:40:17	@PikFan	hm
2014-05-29 20:40:34	@PikFan	my throat hurts, there's pressure in my left ear, and my nose is stuffy
2014-05-29 20:41:33	@Espyo	:/
2014-05-29 20:42:51	@PikFan	I hope I'm not sick tomorrow
2014-05-29 20:43:01	@PikFan	we're doing something very important at school
2014-05-29 20:43:37	@Espyo	because the year is ending?
2014-05-29 20:43:50	@PikFan	kind of...
2014-05-29 20:44:08	@PikFan	we're doing an Ellis Island simulation
2014-05-29 20:44:13	@PikFan	in our history class

2014-05-29 20:50:18	@PikFan	if I pop my wrinklers now I'll get 7.6 sex
2014-05-29 20:50:20	@J	this happens to me whenever I stay at my parents' house - I think it's because there's a lot of dust in the room
2014-05-29 20:50:29	@Espyo	could be that
2014-05-29 20:50:37	@Espyo	I think I used to have that when I slept at my grandpa's
2014-05-29 20:50:45	@Espyo	but my room doesn't have much dust
2014-05-29 20:50:48	@PikFan	do you have allergies?

2014-05-29 20:51:19	@PikFan	maybe your house has more dust than normal
2014-05-29 20:51:21	@J	yeah, I guess it wouldn't suddenly start happening

2014-05-30 21:13:35	@Espyo	I just... connected it
2014-05-30 21:13:56	@J	what about the thingy controller

2014-05-30 21:14:02	@J	you know the one

2014-05-30 21:14:59	@Espyo	N64?
2014-05-30 21:15:22	@J	the new one for the Wii U
2014-05-30 21:15:27	@J	like the classic controller, but not
2014-05-30 21:16:13	@Espyo	Pro
2014-05-30 21:16:23	@Espyo	I think that works with Smash 4 too
2014-05-30 21:16:43	@J	why allow GCN too, then?  Isn't the pro one basically the same thing?
2014-05-30 21:18:50	@Espyo	not even close
2014-05-30 21:18:53	@Espyo	GCN is revolutionary
2014-05-30 21:18:58	@Espyo	more ergonomic
2014-05-30 21:19:03	@Espyo	eh, but less subjectively...
2014-05-30 21:19:09	@Espyo	the buttons are laid out differently
2014-05-30 21:26:26	@J	I doubt they're allowing you to use GCN controllers because they admit their newer controllers are worse
2014-05-30 21:26:45	@Espyo	because of demand
2014-05-30 21:26:56	@Espyo	people LOVE the GCN one

2014-05-30 21:59:07	@Espyo	"friend"
2014-05-30 22:07:42	@Espyo	all right, so this weird person joined earlier today
2014-05-30 22:07:47	@Espyo	under the nickname thepikminmeister
2014-05-30 22:07:52	@Espyo	then complained that it was too quiet, and left
2014-05-30 22:07:58	@Espyo	obviously, I thought that was TPM
2014-05-30 22:08:04	@Espyo	then they rejoined with "Espio"
2014-05-30 22:08:15	@Espyo	upset, I told "TPM" to drop the act and get back to his real name
2014-05-30 22:08:25	@Espyo	but the user kept insisting they didn't know what was going on
2014-05-30 22:08:33	@Espyo	I know it was the same on both times because of the hostname
2014-05-30 22:08:40	@PikFan	hm
2014-05-30 22:08:45	@PikFan	logs?
2014-05-30 22:08:45	@Espyo	I told them to just switch to "TPM" and stop playing around
2014-05-30 22:08:54	@Espyo	then they rejoined some time later, as "TPM"
2014-05-30 22:09:02	@Espyo	then I realized that it wasn't really TPM
2014-05-30 22:09:04	@Espyo	but a new user
2014-05-30 22:09:07	@Espyo	it was just a huge mess
2014-05-30 22:09:18	@Espyo	now the user keeps having "TPM" in their nick
2014-05-30 22:10:24	@PikFan	I wonder why that guy is using other usernames though
2014-05-30 22:10:31	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/tpm.txt
2014-05-30 22:12:20	@PikFan	ugh, if only the real TPM had an account...
2014-05-30 22:12:42	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-05-30 22:12:53	@PikFan	then we could compare hots

2014-05-30 22:13:48	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-30 22:13:51	@PikFan	...wait, what about a GCN controller adapter?
2014-05-30 22:14:48	@PikFan	nevermind
2014-05-30 22:17:30	@PikFan	well, I'd be happy if they announced support for Pikmin 3
2014-05-30 22:17:45	@PikFan	...well, /possibly/
2014-05-30 22:18:20	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-05-30 22:18:28	@PikFan	one problem
2014-05-30 22:18:34	@Espyo	oh
2014-05-30 22:18:35	@PikFan	the cursor works different
2014-05-30 22:18:38	@Espyo	I just got told on Skype
2014-05-30 22:18:42	@Espyo	there's an update to Pikmin 3!
2014-05-30 22:18:48	@Espyo	you can now throw Pikmin using the touch screen
2014-05-30 22:18:48	@PikFan	.
2014-05-30 22:18:59	@PikFan	interesting
2014-05-30 22:20:10	@PikFan	yeah, just started up the Wii U, and tapped —
2014-05-30 22:20:24	@PikFan	now there's a sign that says,
2014-05-30 22:21:16	@PikFan	"The GamePad control style has been set to [Stylus]. You can switch back to the original controls via the + menu."
2014-05-30 22:21:32	@PikFan	then there's an icon of the stylus to the lower right
2014-05-30 22:22:17	@PikFan	version 2.0.0
2014-05-30 22:22:49	@Espyo	ooh

2014-05-30 22:32:57	@PikFan	it's... confusing
2014-05-30 22:33:09	@PikFan	tapping the touchscreen throws a Pikmin
2014-05-30 22:33:17	@PikFan	touchscreen + L is whistle
2014-05-30 22:34:14	@Espyo	:/
2014-05-30 22:34:35	@J	that makes sense to me
2014-05-30 22:34:36	@PikFan	but I guess it makes sense, because the stylus is in your right hand
2014-05-30 22:35:42	@J	hmm, I remember trying to come up with a DS control scheme for a Pikmin game, years ago before we 'knew' Pikmin 3 was on the Wii
2014-05-30 22:37:10	@PikFan	ok
2014-05-30 22:37:24	@PikFan	there are icons of each of the leaders
2014-05-30 22:37:41	@PikFan	to switch to another leader, you tap their icon
2014-05-30 22:37:58	@PikFan	there's also an icon for spraying your Pikmin, and dismissing
2014-05-30 22:38:28	@Espyo	seems neat
2014-05-30 22:38:33	@PikFan	and ZL is center the camer
2014-05-30 22:38:35	@PikFan	*camera
2014-05-30 22:39:05	@PikFan	if you're playing with TV + GamePad, those icons appear on the GamePad
2014-05-30 22:39:19	@Espyo	wait, but
2014-05-30 22:39:21	@PikFan	if playing with just the GamePad, then those icons are integrated into the HUD
2014-05-30 22:39:34	@Espyo	if you're playing with TV+GP, what does the TV show?
2014-05-30 22:39:54	@PikFan	shows the game
2014-05-30 22:40:14	@Espyo	but shouldn't the game show on the GP, so you can tap where to throw the Pikmin?
2014-05-30 22:40:52	@J	might be more like relative motion - you move a cursor by dragging?
2014-05-30 22:41:03	@PikFan	^
2014-05-30 22:41:12	@Espyo	oh, all right
2014-05-30 22:41:12	@J	like using a graphics tablet
2014-05-30 22:41:15	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-30 22:41:21	@Espyo	and with GP only, you click where you want to throw, yeah?
2014-05-30 22:41:35	@PikFan	yep
2014-05-30 22:41:38	@Espyo	all right
2014-05-30 22:41:58	@PikFan	another thing
2014-05-30 22:42:23	@PikFan	there's one more button, called Apps
2014-05-30 22:42:31	@PikFan	which will take you to the menus
2014-05-30 22:42:35	@Espyo	I pointed this down for when I go around making [[Controls]]

2014-05-30 22:43:07	@PikFan	and to return to the game, there's a button in the lower right called Close App
2014-05-30 22:43:56	@PikFan	also, if you tap the Pikmin bubbles, it will switch the Pikmin type
2014-05-30 22:44:38	@PikFan	if you've locked on to an object, the Dismiss button changes to Charge

2014-06-01 18:18:51	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-01 18:20:45	@J	why do you ask?
2014-06-01 18:22:37	@Espyo	the shading is really crappy
2014-06-01 18:23:08	@J	in what sense?
2014-06-01 18:23:24	@J	I'm pretty sure it's official
2014-06-01 18:23:30	@Espyo	well, the rightmost part doesn't have any shadows
2014-06-01 18:26:20	@J	hmm, strange

2014-06-01 18:30:24	@J	strange, all networking suddenly stopped working
2014-06-01 18:30:33	@J	normally it's just IRC that times out
2014-06-01 18:30:41	@J	I want to blame my router
2014-06-01 18:31:02	@J	anyway, I was about to say that I didn't even notice the shadow thing until you mentioned it
2014-06-01 18:31:21	@J	it does look like the 2 got added later

2014-06-01 18:34:45	@J	I believe we used to have a login for http://press.nintendo.com/loginSplash.jsp through NIWA, but I think it's expired
2014-06-01 18:35:06	@J	you can get media for press there, like logos and concept art and stuff
2014-06-01 18:35:15	@Espyo	yeah, that's my whole conundrum
2014-06-01 18:35:25	@Espyo	oh, neat
2014-06-01 18:35:31	@Espyo	yeah, that must've been where we got it from
2014-06-01 18:36:05	@Espyo	can you still remember what the login is?
2014-06-01 18:37:18	@J	it's saved in Firefox, so I probably deleted it when it stopped working
2014-06-01 18:37:33	@J	I can try searching the NIWA forums (though I might've got it over Skype)
2014-06-01 18:37:37	@Espyo	darn
2014-06-01 18:37:56	@Espyo	it would be nice though
2014-06-01 18:38:01	@Espyo	plus we could also get some Pikmin 3 info
2014-06-01 18:40:14	@Espyo	if you remember the login, but not the password, there's always the forgotten password button
2014-06-01 18:45:41	@J	yeah, but if it's linked to an email it wouldn't be mine
2014-06-01 18:46:07	@J	can't find any mention on the NIWA forums

2014-06-01 18:51:21	@J	oh, I found it - turns out it was just a guest account that expired that year
2014-06-01 18:51:33	@J	there was some discussion though; I'll try and get the full log

2014-06-01 18:53:28	@J	...Skype doesn't have a way of searching all logs, does it?
2014-06-01 18:53:36	@J	I found it in the binary log files, but they're hard to read
2014-06-01 18:53:40	@Espyo	I don't think it does
2014-06-01 18:53:45	@Espyo	Skype is really stupid sometimes

2014-06-01 19:30:22	@J	just now, I tried to close the fridge while opening it
2014-06-01 19:30:49	@J	I just had the idea that there were two things I needed to do, and I did them both at the same time, but they were opposite things
2014-06-01 19:32:20	@Espyo	and then the door broke apart
2014-06-01 19:32:40	@Espyo	that's what happens when your stomach says you're hungry, but your brain says you need to work
2014-06-01 19:33:08	@J	no, I was trying to parallelise

2014-06-01 19:35:59	@Espyo	but yeah, that one's just common
2014-06-01 19:36:08	@Espyo	...that one, not so much

2014-06-02 00:07:53	@Espyo	but yeah, did you double check on all games?
2014-06-02 00:07:56	@Espyo	I guess you didn't
2014-06-02 00:08:02	@Espyo	I'd rather have that info checked
2014-06-02 00:08:11	@Espyo	can you test on P3 now? I'll do it on the first two games real quick
2014-06-02 00:09:45	@PikFan	oh, also
2014-06-02 00:10:11	@PikFan	you know that menu that appears when you're in the Ship's light?
2014-06-02 00:11:17	@Espyo	yeah?
2014-06-02 00:11:53	@PikFan	could you use Dolphin to see what that menu says?
2014-06-02 00:12:17	@Espyo	huh?
2014-06-02 00:12:43	--	UltraPit is now known as UltraShrek
2014-06-02 00:12:56	@PikFan	alright, so
2014-06-02 00:13:15	@PikFan	you know when you're standing in the Ship's light, that little green menu that appears?
2014-06-02 00:13:39	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-06-02 00:13:46	@Espyo	after you press A, right?
2014-06-02 00:13:48	@PikFan	can you use Dolphin to see what's on that menu? like, use Dolphin's... uh, what was it called
2014-06-02 00:13:57	@PikFan	no, not after you press A
2014-06-02 00:14:13	@PikFan	free camera mode?

2014-06-02 00:14:22	@Espyo	OH!
2014-06-02 00:14:27	@Espyo	that little holographic screen
2014-06-02 00:14:30	@PikFan	yes
2014-06-02 00:14:31	@Espyo	good idea
2014-06-02 00:14:38	@Espyo	though ripping the texture would probably be more effective
2014-06-02 00:14:44	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2014-06-02 00:14:45	@Espyo	but yeah, I'll check
2014-06-02 00:14:55	@Espyo	specially because ripping the textures rips all of them
2014-06-02 00:15:00	@Espyo	(all currently loaded)
2014-06-02 00:15:04	@Espyo	so I'd have to check through them all
2014-06-02 00:15:07	@Espyo	with free cam I can just go
2014-06-02 00:15:42	@Espyo	I'm guessing it's just checkerboard
2014-06-02 00:15:45	@Espyo	I mean, a grid
2014-06-02 00:16:22	@Espyo	kind of hard to tell
2014-06-02 00:16:27	@Espyo	oh, but I think that this here is Japanese
2014-06-02 00:16:34	@Espyo	it's really blurry
2014-06-02 00:16:37	@Espyo	I'll have to rip the texture
2014-06-02 00:17:32	@Espyo	that is very clearly not Japanese

2014-06-02 00:18:54	@PikFan	looks like a computer screen with a keyboard
2014-06-02 00:20:17	@Espyo	you can see it reasonably well in-game

2014-06-02 00:35:47	@Espyo	no order, though, that's for sure
2014-06-02 00:36:31	@PikFan	also because flowers are faster

2014-06-02 19:04:00	@PikFan	Espyo: I have an idea
2014-06-02 19:04:13	@PikFan	you know how you made maps for the treasures/ship parts?
2014-06-02 19:04:28	@PikFan	I could make maps of the fruit in P3
2014-06-02 19:05:18	@Espyo	it's in the ToDo already
2014-06-02 19:05:31	@PikFan	oh
2014-06-02 19:05:33	@PikFan	hm
2014-06-02 19:05:43	@PikFan	I have a couple questions though
2014-06-02 19:05:46	@Espyo	mhm?
2014-06-02 19:06:00	@PikFan	what if there are more than one fruit of the same type in an area?
2014-06-02 19:06:18	@PikFan	one map for all or one for each?
2014-06-02 19:06:37	@Espyo	I think a map for all would be good
2014-06-02 19:06:42	@Espyo	maybe
2014-06-02 19:06:51	@Espyo	I think this is one of those things we see when we get there
2014-06-02 19:06:58	@PikFan	it'd be easier on my part...
2014-06-02 19:07:14	@Espyo	like, you know how currently every ship part and overworld treasure article has the "how to get" section
2014-06-02 19:07:16	@PikFan	oh, and I even had a way to make the maps
2014-06-02 19:07:16	@Espyo	and it's pretty long?
2014-06-02 19:07:27	@Espyo	because we give info on the place, what to do to get it, and what to do to retrieve it
2014-06-02 19:07:30	@PikFan	*have
2014-06-02 19:07:39	@Espyo	if we have chunky information like that for every instance of repeated fruit, we probably want a map for each
2014-06-02 19:07:44	@Espyo	so we can have a dedicated section for each
2014-06-02 19:08:00	@PikFan	yeah
2014-06-02 19:08:12	@Espyo	but if in the end, there's not much to say, and all info fits in one section, we might as well have one map
2014-06-02 19:08:16	@PikFan	there are three Sunseed Berries in the Garden of Hope...
2014-06-02 19:08:25	@PikFan	each in a different spot

2014-06-02 21:02:21	@PikFan	hey Espyo, how often do poison pipes appear in aboveground areas?
2014-06-02 21:02:45	@Espyo	uh, not randomly?
2014-06-02 21:02:56	@Espyo	off the top of my head, one gate in AW
2014-06-02 21:03:00	@Espyo	and one gate... in PP?
2014-06-02 21:03:04	@Espyo	oh, one gate in WW
2014-06-02 21:03:06	@PikFan	no, I mean
2014-06-02 21:03:12	@PikFan	you destroy the pipes
2014-06-02 21:03:21	@PikFan	and then the pipes reappear later
2014-06-02 21:03:29	@Espyo	then you meant "reappear" back then
2014-06-02 21:03:35	@Espyo	I don't know then
2014-06-02 21:03:51	@Espyo	probably the same as how must other hazards come back
2014-06-02 21:03:54	@Espyo	maybe even common enemies
2014-06-02 21:04:06	@PikFan	is it an exact time?
2014-06-02 21:05:11	@PikFan	I ask this because now that I can freely play P2 again, I went to the VoR
2014-06-02 21:05:16	@PikFan	and there were poison pipes
2014-06-02 21:05:30	@PikFan	the last time they were destroyed were a while ago
2014-06-02 21:06:01	@PikFan	and I want to know how often they reappear so I can plan ahead of time
2014-06-02 21:06:02	@Espyo	I don't think it's an exact time
2014-06-02 21:06:19	@Espyo	I mean, it should be an exact time, but
2014-06-02 21:06:23	@Espyo	probably 3 days
2014-06-02 21:06:36	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard to test
2014-06-02 21:06:42	@Espyo	then that info could be added to [[Hazard]]
2014-06-02 21:06:42	Testyo	"Hazard" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Hazard
2014-06-02 21:06:52	@PikFan	...they definitely don't reappear every 3 days
2014-06-02 21:06:58	@PikFan	it's longer
2014-06-02 21:07:06	@PikFan	feels like 40-60 days
2014-06-02 21:07:58	@PikFan	is it possible to check the files?
2014-06-02 21:08:05	Miles	...Since when do poison pipes reappear
2014-06-02 21:09:22	@Espyo	really doubt it's in the files
2014-06-02 21:10:40	Miles	Yes it would
2014-06-02 21:11:09	@Espyo	<_>
2014-06-02 21:11:11	@Espyo	that's not what I meant
2014-06-02 21:11:16	@Espyo	I doubt it's readable, is all
2014-06-02 21:11:21	@Espyo	readily readable
2014-06-02 21:11:28	Miles	Yes it would...
2014-06-02 21:11:44	Miles	They put half the game in text files, how would it not be readable
2014-06-02 21:12:39	@Espyo	we have a couple of things that aren't readable, but should
2014-06-02 21:12:45	@Espyo	like the chance of getting nectar out of petrified enemies
2014-06-02 21:13:02	@Espyo	as far as we know, it's not in any text file
2014-06-02 21:13:18	Miles	Well, the objects in each area is not one of those things
2014-06-02 21:13:46	@Espyo	but what about their respawn properties?
2014-06-02 21:14:03	@PikFan	it's amazing how questions spark arguments
2014-06-02 21:14:53	Miles	user\Abe\map\tutorial
2014-06-02 21:15:10	Miles	If the poison pipes are in defaultgen/initgen, they shouldn't ever reappear
2014-06-02 21:15:56	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-02 21:16:04	@Espyo	and what if they're meant to reappear, what file are they in?
2014-06-02 21:16:20	Miles	The loop/nonloop folders

2014-06-02 21:17:06	Miles	? There's 3 files in loop for me
2014-06-02 21:17:25	@Espyo	I checked the EU version
2014-06-02 21:17:33	@Espyo	oh, dammit
2014-06-02 21:17:37	@Espyo	I was checking the Wistful Wild
2014-06-02 21:17:40	@Espyo	my bad
2014-06-02 21:17:52	@Espyo	wait, do those numbers...
2014-06-02 21:17:54	@Espyo	indicate the days?
2014-06-02 21:17:59	@Espyo	I mean, the numbers on the file names
2014-06-02 21:18:31	Miles	Er wait
2014-06-02 21:18:43	@Espyo	 "30-39" et al
2014-06-02 21:18:47	Miles	I am remembering this completely wrong, things can reappear if they're in default/initgen
2014-06-02 21:18:53	Miles	Yes they're days
2014-06-02 21:19:30	@Espyo	hmm, we need to check this more carefully
2014-06-02 21:19:40	@Espyo	to see if we can find enemies that only exist in certain days, and the like
2014-06-02 21:19:45	Miles	Well, I know I found the amount of days it takes for something to respawn before
2014-06-02 21:19:45	@Espyo	unless you did that already
2014-06-02 21:19:52	Miles	I just don't remember where
2014-06-02 21:20:24	@Espyo	this enemy here (can't remember which file is this, I saved a few at random) has 0 		# teki_birth_type 
2014-06-02 21:23:03	@Espyo	uh, the VoR initgen has settings for placement of Pikmin
2014-06-02 21:23:06	@Espyo	including Whites and Purples
2014-06-02 21:23:10	@Espyo	Onions?

2014-06-02 21:24:59	@Espyo	ah!
2014-06-02 21:25:04	Miles	Yeah, that's probably it

2014-06-02 21:25:18	Miles	Enemies with treasures always immediately come back
2014-06-02 21:25:22	@Espyo	= "poison gas pipe"
2014-06-02 21:25:26	@Espyo	ressurect day... is 99
2014-06-02 21:25:35	Miles	lol
2014-06-02 21:25:37	@Espyo	well...
2014-06-02 21:25:43	Miles	PikFan you play the game too much
2014-06-02 21:25:44	@Espyo	that's a thing then
2014-06-02 21:25:51	@Espyo	he has like 700 days clocked
2014-06-02 21:26:06	@PikFan	you wish I had 700 days
2014-06-02 21:26:11	@Espyo	 687?
2014-06-02 21:26:17	@PikFan	try 568
2014-06-02 21:26:29	@Espyo	now I have to check the Ujadani
2014-06-02 21:26:41	@PikFan	anyway, 99? I didn't think it appeared in intervals of 99 days
2014-06-02 21:26:58	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-06-02 21:27:33	@PikFan	Miles: you can never play a game too much
2014-06-02 21:29:16	@Espyo	apparently the WW Whiskerpillars respawn after 3 days
2014-06-02 21:29:20	@Espyo	we need to compile this info somewhere
2014-06-02 21:29:23	@Espyo	into the ToDo it goes
2014-06-02 21:30:59	@Espyo	oh, the gas pipes at the WW also respawn in 99 days
2014-06-02 21:31:36	@Espyo	uh...
2014-06-02 21:31:44	@Espyo	there are two other people reading the ToDo
2014-06-02 21:31:49	@Espyo	one's probably a bot
2014-06-02 21:31:55	@Espyo	the other has a J in their icon
2014-06-02 21:31:57	@Espyo	and it's not J
2014-06-02 21:32:15	@PikFan	I'm reading it
2014-06-02 21:32:27	@Espyo	oh, all right
2014-06-02 21:33:44	@Espyo	this huge list of numbers...
2014-06-02 21:34:01	@Espyo	I think it's possible to set an object's properties on-spawn, per instance
2014-06-02 21:34:14	@Espyo	I mean, I think you could like spawn a Fire Dweevil, but give it 999999999 HP
2014-06-02 21:34:25	@Espyo	and only that one Dweevil
2014-06-02 21:34:32	@Espyo	you could spawn another alongside it and have it have 1 HP

2014-06-02 22:36:58	@J	okay, something weird happened
2014-06-02 22:41:02	@Espyo	heh

2014-06-02 23:18:59	@Espyo	oh, I almost forgot to say this here
2014-06-02 23:19:19	@Espyo	but on the TCRF chatroom, einstein95 told me that there's a better tool to convert .bti files
2014-06-02 23:19:24	@Espyo	they are image files in P2
2014-06-02 23:19:32	@Espyo	up until now, I was using btidump, which randomly worked
2014-06-02 23:19:48	@Espyo	it could convert the Piklopedia icons, for instance, but almost everything else turned out garbled
2014-06-02 23:20:07	@Espyo	he pointed out that a set of tools for Mario Kart Wii could actually decode Pikmin 2's btis just fine
2014-06-02 23:20:27	@Espyo	so with that, I was finally able to find some of the missing letters for the area/cave name font
2014-06-02 23:20:35	@Espyo	like a capital Z, a lowercase q, etc.
2014-06-02 23:20:52	@Espyo	finally, the font I use (will use) in the engine doesn't have those letters custom-made
2014-06-02 23:21:14	@Espyo	I still had to keep my custom-made #, @, /, (, ), and a few others, but meh
2014-06-02 23:21:28	@Espyo	I also used that tool to find a new unused image
2014-06-02 23:21:56	@Espyo	http://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2#Cave-related_Error_Image
2014-06-02 23:22:10	@Espyo	I just wrote that URL, so chances are it might be wrong

2014-06-03 01:06:01	@PikFan	alright, that's weird
2014-06-03 01:06:26	@PikFan	so I'm playing through the Snagret Hole
2014-06-03 01:06:39	@PikFan	on sublevel 5, the Antenna 
2014-06-03 01:06:45	@PikFan	Beetle didn't generate
2014-06-03 01:06:48	@PikFan	...thanks, enter
2014-06-03 01:13:04	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-03 01:13:13	@Espyo	I'm still not sure about the "enemy number" property of a sublevel
2014-06-03 01:13:23	@Espyo	ok, here's how I think the game works:
2014-06-03 01:13:38	@PikFan	this isn't the first time a missing enemy has happened
2014-06-03 01:13:47	@Espyo	every [[cave unit]] has its own data of places to place enemies at
2014-06-03 01:13:48	Testyo	"cave_unit" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=cave_unit
2014-06-03 01:13:58	@Espyo	and the cave picks cave units at random, from a list
2014-06-03 01:14:07	@PikFan	in the Hazard Training sublevel 1, the Fiery Bulblax was missing
2014-06-03 01:14:08	@Espyo	if the placement isn't suitable for an enemy to spawn... it just doesn't
2014-06-03 01:14:24	@Espyo	is the AB of SH5 the one with the treasure?
2014-06-03 01:14:28	@PikFan	yes
2014-06-03 01:14:59	@PikFan	yeah, this unit was missing http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:P2CU_room_mid1_6_metal.jpg
2014-06-03 01:15:09	@Espyo	uh, in that case, that's a lot weirder
2014-06-03 01:15:19	@Espyo	hmmmmmm
2014-06-03 01:15:31	@Espyo	I don't remember there being Antenna Beetles on metal-type caves
2014-06-03 01:15:51	@Espyo	bad memory
2014-06-03 01:16:06	@Espyo	"number of rooms" is 3
2014-06-03 01:16:15	@PikFan	I think the AB is tied to that unit for only the SH
2014-06-03 01:16:20	@Espyo	but I guess the layout forced the game to pick one too many "4-way crossing room"s?
2014-06-03 01:17:10	@Espyo	I mean, on the SH article, did you get two of the first room (in bold), one of the second? or vice-versa?
2014-06-03 01:17:41	@PikFan	two circular rooms, and room w/ blue circle
2014-06-03 01:17:56	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-03 01:18:09	@Espyo	I'm not sure what establishes if a room must spawn or not
2014-06-03 01:18:14	@Espyo	if anything
2014-06-03 01:19:42	@Espyo	what if this happens during a normal playthrough?
2014-06-03 01:19:52	@Espyo	you had that happen in your 500+ day run, right?
2014-06-03 01:20:00	@Espyo	I mean... after you already got the EW
2014-06-03 01:20:39	@PikFan	this literally just happened
2014-06-03 01:20:56	@PikFan	in the 500+ days save
2014-06-03 01:21:01	@PikFan	*file
2014-06-03 01:22:34	@Espyo	I really don't know then
2014-06-03 01:22:44	@Espyo	you should point it down on the article
2014-06-03 01:23:05	@Espyo	the more you know about Pikmin 2 caves, the less you understand
2014-06-03 01:23:20	@Espyo	back when we didn't know about cave units, or a list of objects that can spawn, everything was simple
2014-06-03 01:23:31	@Espyo	now that we do know them, it's hard to understand exactly what the game does

2014-06-03 20:59:28	@J	hmm, I don't remember btidump ever not working
2014-06-03 20:59:34	@J	isn't that the one that gives you a dds?
2014-06-03 21:00:17	@Espyo	it is
2014-06-03 21:00:20	@Espyo	it doesn't work for quite a few
2014-06-03 21:00:24	@Espyo	try the likes of uh...
2014-06-03 21:00:48	@Espyo	well, whatever path to access that err.bti I posted on TCRF
2014-06-03 21:03:28	@J	hmm, GCEdit seems to be broken
2014-06-03 21:03:33	@J	I want to blame GTK
2014-06-03 21:03:36	@J	it's always GTK
2014-06-03 21:03:52	@J	I'd have to compile btidump anyway
2014-06-03 21:03:58	@J	which might involve source code changes
2014-06-03 21:04:01	@J	too lazy
2014-06-03 21:04:20	@J	so it gives you a dds, but when you open that it looks wrong?
2014-06-03 21:04:26	@J	maybe it's just your dds viewer
2014-06-03 21:08:02	@Espyo	XNView? iunno...
2014-06-03 21:08:08	@Espyo	plus I can see other dds files fine
2014-06-03 21:09:23	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/navi_l.bti.dds this is meant to look like a flash
2014-06-03 21:09:30	@Espyo	like light at the end of a black tunnel
2014-06-03 21:09:35	@Espyo	around 32x32
2014-06-03 21:11:39	@J	...and Firefox shows it as text
2014-06-03 21:11:55	@J	I see it fine

2014-06-03 21:12:26	@Espyo	uh, crud
2014-06-03 21:12:39	@Espyo	well, this exports to .png, so it's at least more convenient
2014-06-03 21:13:11	@J	hmm
2014-06-03 21:13:19	@J	imagemagick can probably do dds to png
2014-06-03 21:14:04	@Espyo	yeah, the conversion isn't the problem... kinda
2014-06-03 21:14:12	@Espyo	I mean, XNView can also convert it
2014-06-03 21:14:26	@Espyo	but with this new tool, at least it converts to PNG right away, and I always get a working result
2014-06-03 21:14:29	@J	yeah
2014-06-03 21:14:30	@Espyo	so... at least it works for me
2014-06-03 21:14:32	@J	fair enough
2014-06-03 21:14:39	@Espyo	but I really have to wonder why in the world XNView doesn't work
2014-06-03 21:14:45	@Espyo	it's a really praised image viewer, and for good reason
2014-06-03 21:14:50	@J	I assume btidump uses dds because bti and dds are closely related or something
2014-06-03 21:14:59	@Espyo	it has batch tools, conversions, file explorer...
2014-06-03 21:15:02	@J	I just used GIMP with gimp-plugin-dds
2014-06-03 21:15:03	@Espyo	they must be

2014-06-03 21:41:58	@Espyo	"image viewer" isn't really what XNView is
2014-06-03 21:42:06	@Espyo	I'm sure it has some better name

2014-06-03 21:50:44	@Espyo	hehe
2014-06-03 21:50:52	@Espyo	but I think XNView is actually quite scriptable
2014-06-03 21:50:56	@Espyo	like I said, batch jobs and all
2014-06-03 21:51:52	@J	when I say scriptable, I mean scriptable from a common interface, not providing its own separate, non-interoperable scripting functions
2014-06-03 21:52:12	@J	but I guess it depends how it works
2014-06-03 21:52:56	@J	maybe you can run it without user interaction by pointing it to a file that defines what to do
2014-06-03 21:53:14	@J	but it's not going to be as good as 'convert a.dds a.png'

2014-06-05 22:46:47	@Espyo	yes
2014-06-05 22:46:57	@Espyo	we need even more policies
2014-06-05 22:47:05	@Espyo	spoiler policy, for one
2014-06-05 22:47:08	@Espyo	article policy too
2014-06-05 22:48:55	@J	*'''Short'''
2014-06-05 22:49:03	@J	maybe you should follow this policy in your policy
2014-06-05 22:50:12	@Espyo	that's for Trivia
2014-06-05 22:50:15	@Espyo	not the Policy Policy
2014-06-05 22:51:07	@J	it should be, is what I'm saying
2014-06-05 22:53:17	@Espyo	then again, I'm sure that Trivia Policy has some pretty redundant parts
2014-06-05 22:53:26	@Espyo	that's why I need a second and third opinion
2014-06-05 22:53:40	@Espyo	and the third opinion is skipping their job...
2014-06-05 22:53:43	@J	yeah, this is way too long
2014-06-05 22:54:08	@J	it could be about 5 bullet points and say everything you've said here
2014-06-05 22:54:08	Mariofan169	Link?
2014-06-05 22:54:16	@J	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/trivia%20policy.txt
2014-06-05 22:54:40	@J	I'm not a fan of over-specifying policy/rules, or even saying much at all about things that should be common sense
2014-06-05 22:54:44	Mariofan169	...ain't nobody got time for that
2014-06-05 22:55:27	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-06-05 22:55:29	@J	specific examples: most of the 2nd set of bullet points is just the 1st set negated
2014-06-05 22:55:29	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-06-05 22:55:38	@Espyo	that is pretty true
2014-06-05 22:55:40	@Espyo	and I know that
2014-06-05 22:55:43	@Espyo	but I felt it was... necessary?
2014-06-05 22:55:44	@J	an example for each point is overkill
2014-06-05 22:55:48	@Espyo	pfeh, probably not, huh
2014-06-05 22:55:51	@Espyo	yeah, I also thought that
2014-06-05 22:55:53	@J	everything is just too wordy
2014-06-05 22:56:00	@Espyo	but I thought "if I have to give one example, I should give it to all"
2014-06-05 22:56:28	@Espyo	eesh, in retrospect this entire text is pretty poor
2014-06-05 22:56:31	@Espyo	I wrote it like two days ago
2014-06-05 22:56:34	@Espyo	really needs work
2014-06-05 22:56:40	@J	and then you give another example and explain every point again
2014-06-05 22:57:04	@Espyo	yeah
2014-06-05 22:57:14	@Espyo	I guess I really, REALLY wanted to drive the point home
2014-06-05 22:57:30	@J	look at [[Pikipedia:Policy]] - it covers more than you do here, and in much less text
2014-06-05 22:57:31	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Policy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Policy
2014-06-05 22:58:37	@Espyo	uh, I forgot we had that
2014-06-05 22:58:44	@J	but yeah, you drive points home by making them short and simple, not by saying them again and again
2014-06-05 22:58:46	@Espyo	yeah, but nothing on trivia
2014-06-05 22:59:31	@J	yeah, I know, I wasn't saying there was
2014-06-05 22:59:48	@J	also, some of this stuff isn't specific to trivia
2014-06-05 22:59:51	@J	like 'objective'
2014-06-05 22:59:57	@J	and the whole spoiler bit, really
2014-06-05 23:00:54	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-05 23:01:05	@Espyo	what was I DOING when I wrote that?
2014-06-05 23:01:10	@Espyo	I couldn't have been doing just the policy
2014-06-05 23:01:16	@Espyo	I had to have been doing something in the background
2014-06-05 23:01:42	@J	and now it's suddenly 11pm and I'm almost out of marshmallows
2014-06-05 23:02:36	@Espyo	those are related, I know they are
2014-06-05 23:03:39	@J	anyway, I'm not sure I would agree we need lots more policy articles, but trivia does seem like a pretty important one, given how easily it can get out of control
2014-06-05 23:04:06	@J	OTOH, people who add trivia are probably the least likely to be reading policy
2014-06-05 23:04:18	@J	but I guess it just gives you something to link to if you remove stuff
2014-06-05 23:04:46	@Espyo	yesah
2014-06-05 23:04:48	@Espyo	*yeah
2014-06-05 23:04:55	@Espyo	and not a LOT
2014-06-05 23:05:14	@Espyo	off the top of my head, just trivia and spoiler
2014-06-05 23:05:17	@J	also, 'almost out of marshmallows' means 'down to < 100g'
2014-06-05 23:05:21	@Espyo	we already have the rest anyway
2014-06-05 23:05:37	@Espyo	meaning pretty much less than 50
2014-06-05 23:05:46	@J	oh, they're not small ones

2014-06-05 23:10:30	@J	also, it says pink and white marshmallows on the bag, but they're all white
2014-06-05 23:10:46	@J	I mean, I _think_ I can tell the difference between pink and white
2014-06-05 23:10:52	@J	why would they lie like that?<
2014-06-05 23:10:56	@J	*-<
2014-06-05 23:12:08	@Espyo	well, PikFan helped
2014-06-05 23:12:26	@Espyo	ours over here are normally pink, blue and white
2014-06-05 23:12:30	@Espyo	but they actually have color
2014-06-05 23:12:43	@Espyo	so must be a thing over there to have them bleach-white
2014-06-05 23:12:54	@Espyo	maybe the color...itives? are too expensive?
2014-06-05 23:12:58	@Espyo	colorants...
2014-06-05 23:13:00	@Espyo	oh, colorants is the word
2014-06-05 23:16:06	@J	it's just these ones

2014-06-08 18:27:28	@Espyo	WELL THEN
2014-06-08 18:27:41	@Espyo	I just managed to have an unsigned 1-byte variable store a value of over 50 thousand
2014-06-08 18:27:51	@Espyo	then I told visual studio to recompile from scratch
2014-06-08 18:28:04	@Espyo	and it must've realized that the variable isn't meant to do that
2014-06-08 18:31:33	@Espyo	oh, and now the engine is crashing for no reason
2014-06-08 18:31:52	@Espyo	says that a function can't create a color, and says that this function was called by something completely unrelated
2014-06-08 18:32:01	@Espyo	I'm... going to restart vs...
2014-06-08 19:03:17	@J	fun
2014-06-08 19:03:36	@J	so, I just found some bright green liquid at the bottom of one of my bins
2014-06-08 19:04:01	@J	the only thing I can think of with that colour that could possibly be liquid is jelly, but I haven't had any
2014-06-08 19:08:05	@Espyo	dishwasher?
2014-06-08 19:13:29	@J	how would a dishwasher fit in my bin?
2014-06-08 19:14:51	@Espyo	a goop of dishwasher
2014-06-08 19:14:54	@Espyo	not a bottle
2014-06-08 19:17:30	@J	oh, washing-up liquid?
2014-06-08 19:17:42	@J	actually...I did throw away one of those the other day
2014-06-08 19:17:44	@J	you're a genius
2014-06-08 19:18:47	@J	anyway, dishwasher here means one of this big machines that washes dishes
2014-06-08 19:18:54	@J	or a person who washes dishes
2014-06-08 19:19:14	@J	*those
2014-06-08 19:34:30	@Espyo	oh
2014-06-08 19:34:35	@Espyo	...of course it does
2014-06-08 19:34:48	@Espyo	but... I could swear the liquid is also called a dishwasher
2014-06-08 19:34:50	@Espyo	what's it called, then?
2014-06-08 19:36:02	@J	[19:17:30] @J oh, washing-up liquid?
2014-06-08 19:36:53	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-06-08 19:37:00	@Espyo	that's... a really weird name to call it
2014-06-08 19:37:05	@Espyo	granted, I'm not sure how it is in America
2014-06-08 19:37:11	@Espyo	it's just that "dishwasher" sounded right
2014-06-08 19:38:54	@J	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwashing_liquid
2014-06-08 19:40:26	@Espyo	all right, fair enough
2014-06-08 19:40:35	@Espyo	ooh, this is neat
2014-06-08 19:40:59	@Espyo	if the Cloaking Burrow-nit stabs a Pikmin, the Pikmin's animation changes to the pummel animation, for no reason
2014-06-08 19:41:15	@Espyo	but it looks as though the Pikmin is trying to punch the Cloaking Burrow-nit to try to get it to release it
2014-06-08 19:41:42	@Espyo	anyway, first push in months, here I come!
2014-06-08 19:41:53	@Espyo	the area editor and geometry is now finally working
2014-06-08 19:43:38	@J	way more productive than me
2014-06-08 19:44:35	@Espyo	well, I've been at it non-stop
2014-06-08 19:44:45	@Espyo	except for the times where I stopped to play games, those don't count

2014-06-08 21:32:33	@J	it's been so long since I played - was Ike a Ganondorf clone?
2014-06-08 21:32:35	@J	or close?
2014-06-08 21:32:49	@J	I know Captain Falcon is, but
2014-06-08 21:32:58	@J	maybe I'm just crazy
2014-06-08 21:36:20	@Espyo	Luigi got better, IMO
2014-06-08 21:36:24	@Espyo	his aerial game is incredible
2014-06-08 21:36:33	@Espyo	Ike is not really anybody's clone
2014-06-08 21:41:20	Miles	Ike is a clone of Marth
2014-06-08 21:41:32	Miles	They share the same Down B
2014-06-08 21:41:48	Miles	It doesn't matter that they're different in every single other way, they're clones
2014-06-08 21:42:26	@Espyo	that reminds me of the Lucario/Mewtwo thing
2014-06-08 21:42:32	@Espyo	it's really hard not to think of them as clones
2014-06-08 21:42:37	@Espyo	but the only move they share is the neutral-B
2014-06-08 21:42:42	@Espyo	other than that, they're really different

2014-06-08 21:45:16	@J	hmm, I felt like Luigi's aerial moves got weaker, and B-up was definitely nerfed, maybe B-side too
2014-06-08 21:45:47	@J	yeah, when I say clone I don't mean it in a literal or negative way, just a 'they feel kind of the same'
2014-06-08 21:45:48	@Espyo	B-up is the same as Melee's, but changed from the original
2014-06-08 21:45:53	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-08 21:45:55	@Espyo	even still they don't
2014-06-08 21:45:58	@Espyo	Ike's like a tank
2014-06-08 21:46:00	@Espyo	Marth's smoother
2014-06-08 21:46:07	@J	I didn't say Marth
2014-06-08 21:46:14	@J	but I probably did misremember
2014-06-08 21:46:36	@J	for some reason I'm thinking there's a 'third' Ganondorf, but I could be wrong
2014-06-08 21:47:06	@J	yeah, it's the same as Melee's, but isn't it weaker?
2014-06-08 21:47:13	@J	less knockback or something
2014-06-08 21:49:52	@J	oh, and obviously no wavedashing disadvantages Luigi compared to Melee
2014-06-08 21:50:25	@Espyo	oops
2014-06-08 21:50:33	@Espyo	don't think it has less
2014-06-08 21:50:38	@Espyo	(knockback)
2014-06-08 21:50:50	@Espyo	lack of wavedashing is pretty sucky, though I never used it

2014-06-10 21:43:07	@J	that game seems a bit like De Blob
2014-06-10 21:44:35	@J	I have to say, I've never really been much of a fan of 'keep doing this thing to try to hold something off' kind of games
2014-06-10 21:44:46	@J	which covers tower defence
2014-06-10 21:45:09	@Espyo	different tastes
2014-06-10 21:45:20	@Espyo	the game seems like one of those that's fun, but only in small doses
2014-06-10 21:45:23	@Espyo	looks like it gets tiring quickly
2014-06-10 21:49:55	@J	anyway, if there's any FPS I'm excited about, it's Spire by Hitbox
2014-06-10 21:51:02	@J	'On Spire, one of our goals since the beginning has been to create an FPS movement system that feels snappy like Dustforce, incorporating walljumps, wall sliding, and other advanced techniques.
2014-06-10 21:51:04	@J	'
2014-06-10 21:51:07	@J	because Dustforce
2014-06-10 21:52:06	@Espyo	hmm, nice

2014-06-11 19:08:12	@J	I guess I would say Espyo with a 'b' sound for the 'p', because of the 's'
2014-06-11 19:08:26	@Espyo	hm, that's new
2014-06-11 19:09:02	@J	well, b isn't very different from p anyway

2014-06-11 19:27:31	Mariostar123	Espyo,do you gift yourself at Christmas?
2014-06-11 19:27:44	@Espyo	not really
2014-06-11 19:28:06	Mariostar123	You should try,just incase you ever need to spend it ob someone else
2014-06-11 19:28:33	Mariostar123	that way,you know what life is like with the less money,so your body is ready for the futer
2014-06-11 19:29:02	Mariostar123	And I guess you could save up for a Wiiu
2014-06-11 19:29:19	@Espyo	I'm not following
2014-06-11 19:29:26	Mariostar123	.....
2014-06-11 19:29:34	Mariostar123	Ummm....
2014-06-11 19:29:58	Mariostar123	Im not sure how to discribe it without saying....things....
2014-06-11 19:30:13	Mariostar123	Will google translate help?....
2014-06-11 19:30:24	@Espyo	no no
2014-06-11 19:30:33	@Espyo	that's not it
2014-06-11 19:30:40	@Espyo	it's not that I don't understand the English, because I do
2014-06-11 19:30:48	@Espyo	it's just that I'm not seeing how the idea makes sense
2014-06-11 19:30:57	@Espyo	how does gifting myself make me save up money?
2014-06-11 19:31:30	Mariostar123	Putting it aside for a Wiiu?
2014-06-11 19:31:54	Mariostar123	BTW,this explains the 3DS Mii gunner http://www.smashbros.com/en-uk/howto/entry2.html
2014-06-11 19:32:17	@Espyo	I saw how the Miis work, I just need to feel them in-game
2014-06-11 19:32:23	@Espyo	yeah, but
2014-06-11 19:32:29	@Espyo	if I'm using money to buy something for myself
2014-06-11 19:32:35	@Espyo	how is that putting money aside?
2014-06-11 19:32:43	Mariostar123	Miis are not playable with "strangers" online
2014-06-11 19:32:58	Mariostar123	Im not sure how to describe it to be honest

2014-06-17 01:23:30	@Espyo	it refers to the fruit's large size being enough to solve hunger problems
2014-06-17 01:23:32	@Espyo	that IS the premise of P3
2014-06-17 01:23:41	@Espyo	regardless of Olimar specifying Hocotate

2014-06-17 01:31:37	@Espyo	oh, there he is
2014-06-17 01:32:04	@PikFan	how's this? "Olimar's journal entry for this treasure coincides with the basic plot of Pikmin 3."
2014-06-17 01:32:14	@PikFan	was distracted with something
2014-06-17 01:35:00	@PikFan	...alright I must be very very lucky
2014-06-17 01:35:14	@PikFan	that was my third F+CF today
2014-06-17 01:36:32	@Espyo	I guess that works
2014-06-17 01:36:39	@Espyo	nice
2014-06-17 01:36:50	@Espyo	did you read [[Region]] yet?
2014-06-17 01:36:50	Testyo	"Region" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Region
2014-06-17 01:37:09	@Espyo	I'm wondering if there's anything glaringly obviously stupid that I missed
2014-06-17 01:37:50	@PikFan	heh
2014-06-17 01:38:04	@PikFan	we need European users who own P3
2014-06-17 01:38:26	@PikFan	I think there are major differences in the in-game dialogue

2014-06-17 01:41:05	@Espyo	you could've given a reason for the reversion on [[Bulbmin]]

2014-06-17 01:41:16	@Espyo	we want people to understand why the reversion happened
2014-06-17 01:41:30	@Espyo	we don't want them to think we're the elitist snobs that can't take any edits from the outside, and trust nobody but ourselves
2014-06-17 01:42:05	@PikFan	wait so
2014-06-17 01:42:12	@PikFan	let me get this straight
2014-06-17 01:42:23	@PikFan	I should only rollback spammy/vandal edits?
2014-06-17 01:42:35	@PikFan	all others, undo+reason?
2014-06-17 01:42:35	@Espyo	no, I said you could've given a reason on the summary
2014-06-17 01:42:41	@Espyo	yeah
2014-06-17 01:42:45	@Espyo	if it's spam, just revert
2014-06-17 01:42:50	@Espyo	otherwise, try to provide a reason
2014-06-17 01:42:54	@Espyo	suppose it's you on some wiki
2014-06-17 01:42:59	@Espyo	you notice something you know, and is missing
2014-06-17 01:43:01	@Espyo	you add it
2014-06-17 01:43:05	@Espyo	and it gets reverted for no reason
2014-06-17 01:43:06	@Espyo	how'd you feel?
2014-06-17 01:43:12	@Espyo	you'd think the wiki users there are horrible people
2014-06-17 01:43:16	@PikFan	upset
2014-06-17 01:43:22	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-17 01:43:40	@Espyo	that anon contributor did a silly contribution, but I bet they'll feel upset over the reversion
2014-06-17 01:43:51	@PikFan	yeah
2014-06-17 01:43:56	@PikFan	I was like that years ago
2014-06-17 01:44:01	@PikFan	I added silly stuff
2014-06-17 01:44:10	@Espyo	whereas if it had like "this could've been worded better, and it's speculative", the user would understand the reversion
2014-06-17 01:44:11	@PikFan	then later I'd notice it was gone
2014-06-17 01:45:49	@Espyo	also yeah, here's what I plan on happening
2014-06-17 01:45:55	@Espyo	when I get Pikmin 3 and add all info that's needed
2014-06-17 01:45:59	@Espyo	I'll go through ALL pages on the wiki
2014-06-17 01:46:01	@Espyo	and double-check everything
2014-06-17 01:46:15	@Espyo	so when I get to pages with P3 dialog
2014-06-17 01:46:19	@Espyo	I'll notice that my game is different
2014-06-17 01:46:22	@Espyo	and add the missing region differences

2014-06-18 19:05:49	@J	okay, I must've not completely closed my freezer door yesterday, because suddenly lots of icicles and frost
2014-06-18 19:19:56	@Espyo	ugh, that's horrible
2014-06-18 19:27:39	@Espyo	uh, I begun importing the pages onto the new Carmageddon wiki
2014-06-18 19:27:53	@Espyo	the problem is that when I imported "Carmageddon: Reincarnation", it created the "Carmageddon" namespace
2014-06-18 19:28:02	@Espyo	and apparently, that's irreversible, and the world just collapsed

2014-06-18 19:54:04	@J	that's not possible
2014-06-18 19:54:18	@J	namespaces are defined in LocalSettings.php
2014-06-18 19:54:25	@J	if they're not in there, they don't exist
2014-06-18 19:54:27	@Espyo	yeah, he said as well
2014-06-18 19:54:29	@Espyo	I figured out the problem
2014-06-18 19:54:32	@Espyo	http://wiki.carmageddon.com/w/api.php?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=namespaces
2014-06-18 19:54:38	@Espyo	"Carmageddon" isn't a new namespace, it's the project namespace
2014-06-18 19:54:41	@Espyo	like we have Pikipedia:
2014-06-18 19:54:45	@J	yeah, it already existing
2014-06-18 19:54:48	@J	*existed
2014-06-18 19:54:56	@Espyo	on wikia, this didn't happen because the project namespace was "Carmageddon Wiki:"
2014-06-18 19:54:56	@J	so some pages will need to be moved afterwards
2014-06-18 19:55:11	@Espyo	this project namespace is given its name from the wiki's name
2014-06-18 19:55:16	@Espyo	...it's possible to change the wiki's name, right?
2014-06-18 19:55:33	@J	it doesn't have to be the wiki's name
2014-06-18 19:55:40	@J	it can be controlled separately
2014-06-18 19:55:59	@J	in fact, I don't think there's anything special about the project namespace, it's just convention
2014-06-18 19:56:27	@Espyo	it can? ah, good
2014-06-18 19:56:35	@Espyo	yeah, there's nothing special
2014-06-18 19:57:00	@J	you're just exporting from wikia then importing via special:import, right?
2014-06-18 19:57:26	@J	I think the file is XML, so if you wanted you could run a script on it to change page names before importing
2014-06-18 19:57:38	@Espyo	yeah
2014-06-18 19:57:50	@Espyo	yeah, but we can't change the page names
2014-06-18 19:57:57	@Espyo	"Carmageddon: Reincarnation" is the name of the game
2014-06-18 19:57:59	@Espyo	there's no way around it
2014-06-18 19:58:09	@Espyo	the "Carmageddon" project namespace is the one that needs renaming to "Carmageddon Wiki"
2014-06-18 20:00:04	@J	ah
2014-06-18 20:00:37	@J	you could use DISPLAYTITLE, but yeah, that's messy
2014-06-18 20:00:40	@Espyo	all right, hopefully that'd be all
2014-06-18 20:00:43	@Espyo	yeah, messy
2014-06-18 20:00:54	@Espyo	the guy's such a sport
2014-06-18 20:00:59	@Espyo	it took him forever to implement the wiki
2014-06-18 20:01:05	@Espyo	but today he really sat down and helped me with it

2014-06-19 19:04:24	@Espyo	preeeeetty darn sure these are Unix instructions
2014-06-19 19:05:21	@Espyo	oh, there are some windows instructions, but they don't really say anything useful
2014-06-19 19:07:20	@Espyo	err, I can actually run the bot, it seems
2014-06-19 19:07:31	@Espyo	though python complains that line 111 has an error on the last character
2014-06-19 19:07:38	@Espyo	print 'Warning: login details incorrect'
2014-06-19 19:07:42	@Espyo	error on the final '
2014-06-19 19:14:38	@J	exact error?
2014-06-19 19:14:52	@J	oh, it'll be wrong Python version
2014-06-19 19:14:54	@J	you need 2
2014-06-19 19:14:55	@J	not 3
2014-06-19 19:15:09	@Espyo	I think I have both installed
2014-06-19 19:15:15	@J	need to use the right one, then
2014-06-19 19:15:17	@Espyo	uh... how do I make python use version 2?
2014-06-19 19:15:25	@Espyo	I just type "python blabla.py"
2014-06-19 19:15:27	@J	don't just open the file, run it via cmd
2014-06-19 19:15:28	@J	oh
2014-06-19 19:15:30	@Espyo	--v2?
2014-06-19 19:15:31	@J	type the full path
2014-06-19 19:15:41	@Espyo	oh, simple enough
2014-06-19 19:15:42	@J	they're separate executables, and the one on your path seems to be 3
2014-06-19 19:15:54	@J	C:\Python2x\python.exe thingy
2014-06-19 19:16:20	@J	that will say it can't find curl, hopefully
2014-06-19 19:16:33	@Espyo	pycurl, actually
2014-06-19 19:16:37	@Espyo	uh, yeah
2014-06-19 19:17:12	@Espyo	I figured pycurl would just be a set of .py files
2014-06-19 19:17:17	@Espyo	but suddenly binaries are involved
2014-06-19 19:17:48	@J	so you need the pycurl for your python version
2014-06-19 19:17:56	@J	probably http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/download/pycurl-7.19.3.win32-py2.7.exe
2014-06-19 19:18:24	@Espyo	I had actually downloaded the 3 one, so yeah
2014-06-19 19:18:27	@J	looks like an installer, should put modules in the Python installation
2014-06-19 19:18:32	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-19 19:18:45	@Espyo	pfft, old-timey installer
2014-06-19 19:18:52	@Espyo	err, claims it can't find 2.7
2014-06-19 19:18:54	@Espyo	mustn't be on the registry
2014-06-19 19:18:57	@Espyo	let me take a look
2014-06-19 19:19:05	@Espyo	I do have 2.7
2014-06-19 19:19:10	@Espyo	now how can I tell windows that I do...
2014-06-19 19:19:11	@J	you might have 2.6
2014-06-19 19:19:21	@Espyo	the folder I went to was python27
2014-06-19 19:19:28	@Espyo	(uppercase P, even)
2014-06-19 19:19:52	@J	hmm
2014-06-19 19:20:05	@Espyo	I'll just reinstall it
2014-06-19 19:20:09	@J	those installers have always worked for me (many Python modules seem to use the same installer)
2014-06-19 19:20:13	@Espyo	in fact, I'm not sure why I have two versions
2014-06-19 19:20:23	@J	you could just point it at the path in the installer, can't you?
2014-06-19 19:20:23	@Espyo	but 2.7 might've messed up somewhere
2014-06-19 19:20:27	@J	possibly
2014-06-19 19:21:14	@Espyo	well crud
2014-06-19 19:21:23	@Espyo	the installer's warning that this install will replace the existing 2.7
2014-06-19 19:21:31	@Espyo	so the system DOES recognize Python 2.7
2014-06-19 19:21:35	@Espyo	well, no harm in reinstalling anyway, I guess
2014-06-19 19:22:00	@Espyo	while this is taking forever...
2014-06-19 19:22:08	@Espyo	how would I config the credentials and such for the bot?
2014-06-19 19:23:41	@Espyo	uh, crud, need to close HexChat

2014-06-19 19:30:58	@J	so how did you install it?
2014-06-19 19:31:06	@Espyo	l33 is pycurl inclusion...
2014-06-19 19:31:10	@J	yeah
2014-06-19 19:31:11	@Espyo	Python 2.7.7 installed just fine
2014-06-19 19:31:17	@Espyo	with pycurl, I grabbed the zip file
2014-06-19 19:31:23	@Espyo	and extracted it onto the 2.7.7 install
2014-06-19 19:31:30	@Espyo	the Doc and Lib folders matched
2014-06-19 19:34:08	@J	hmm, there's no real reason for that not to work
2014-06-19 19:34:24	@J	dinner is happening, so give me a bit
2014-06-19 19:34:31	@J	I'll try it in a VM after

2014-06-19 19:51:31	@Espyo	 64
2014-06-19 19:51:37	@J	...oh
2014-06-19 19:51:47	@J	you see the 'win32' in the pycurl filename?
2014-06-19 19:52:01	@Espyo	but "win32" is the name given to anything windows
2014-06-19 19:52:09	@Espyo	plus there's no 64 anything
2014-06-19 19:52:11	@Espyo	at least not on the download page
2014-06-19 19:52:18	@J	yeah, you need 32-bit Python
2014-06-19 19:52:24	@Espyo	hm, fair enough
2014-06-19 19:52:36	@J	you should know by now on Windows: hardly anything does 64-bit, so just always go with 32-bit
2014-06-19 19:52:44	@Espyo	egh, you're right
2014-06-19 19:53:12	@Espyo	you just never know when you'll find some cruddy program that wants a specific version
2014-06-19 19:53:28	@Espyo	did... the Python website change in the last 30 minutes?
2014-06-19 19:53:41	@J	in what way?
2014-06-19 19:53:51	@Espyo	the entire layout is different
2014-06-19 19:53:58	@Espyo	I re-downloaded the installer just some minutes ago
2014-06-19 19:54:02	@Espyo	the 64-bit one
2014-06-19 19:54:05	@Espyo	now I went for the 32-bit one
2014-06-19 19:54:10	@Espyo	I don't remember the site looking like this
2014-06-19 19:54:17	@Espyo	warning: I might have Alzheimer's
2014-06-19 19:54:28	@Espyo	oh, it was just a different page
2014-06-19 19:54:31	@Espyo	...all right then
2014-06-19 19:55:14	@Espyo	this installer doesn't complain that there's an existing Python 2 installation, hmm
2014-06-19 19:55:59	@Espyo	I... guess it installed even though HexChat was on
2014-06-19 19:56:35	@Espyo	well, it has to be straightforward now, eesh
2014-06-19 19:57:22	@Espyo	well, the Python script ran
2014-06-19 19:57:23	@Espyo	no output
2014-06-19 19:57:29	@Espyo	guessing that's because it has no credentials or anything
2014-06-19 20:00:38	@Espyo	yeah, where DO I set those?
2014-06-19 20:00:42	@Espyo	I couldn't find anything in any file
2014-06-19 20:01:57	@J	yeah, I sent you another file
2014-06-19 20:02:00	@J	you probably lost it
2014-06-19 20:02:48	@Espyo	http://sprunge.us/BEaE oh, hi
2014-06-19 20:02:54	@J	yeah
2014-06-19 20:03:01	@Espyo	in my defense, you sent me that like two days after
2014-06-19 20:03:25	@J	you can replace any of the lines at the top with hardcoded strings, if you end up having to do it a lot of times for whatever reason
2014-06-19 20:03:49	@J	all the things should be in the same directory
2014-06-19 20:03:56	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-19 20:04:07	@Espyo	for the source wiki, would that be http://carmageddon.wikia.com or http://carmageddon.wikia.com/wiki
2014-06-19 20:04:30	@J	it's the path with api.php
2014-06-19 20:04:43	@J	I think Wikia does /api.php, so the first one
2014-06-19 20:04:43	@Espyo	oh, this goes via .api
2014-06-19 20:04:46	@Espyo	*-.
2014-06-19 20:05:23	@Espyo	is it picky about whether the second one is wiki.carmageddon.com/w/ or wiki.carmageddon.com/w
2014-06-19 20:05:26	@Espyo	?
2014-06-19 20:05:28	@J	no
2014-06-19 20:05:31	@Espyo	great
2014-06-19 20:05:32	@J	...I don't think
2014-06-19 20:05:38	@J	it's been a while
2014-06-19 20:05:54	@Espyo	well, we'll see
2014-06-19 20:06:37	@Espyo	oh, the background changed
2014-06-19 20:06:41	@Espyo	it's so uncontrasting
2014-06-19 20:06:43	@Espyo	but it works well
2014-06-19 20:06:55	@Espyo	...and we're so worried about our barely-contrasting grass background
2014-06-19 20:07:40	@Espyo	isn't there a wiki setting or user group for bots?
2014-06-19 20:07:55	@Espyo	from what I know, it increases some request things for bot users
2014-06-19 20:08:00	@Espyo	plus hides their edits on the recent changes
2014-06-19 20:08:35	@J	background of what?
2014-06-19 20:08:42	@J	yeah, a user can be a bot
2014-06-19 20:08:47	@J	you probably want a separate bot account
2014-06-19 20:08:55	@J	it also hides bot edits in RC by default
2014-06-19 20:09:03	@J	...oh, you said that
2014-06-19 20:09:05	@Espyo	the Carma wiki, on the official website
2014-06-19 20:09:28	@Espyo	one thing: Python comment blocks are started and ended with ''', yeah?
2014-06-19 20:09:42	@J	they can do
2014-06-19 20:09:56	@J	but those are also valid strings
2014-06-19 20:10:25	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-19 20:10:31	@Espyo	your code has """
2014-06-19 20:10:37	@J	yeah, that's valid too
2014-06-19 20:10:38	@Espyo	though Notepad++ highlights them differently
2014-06-19 20:10:50	@Espyo	'''stuff''' is orange, """stuff""" is black
2014-06-19 20:10:54	@Espyo	"strings" are gray
2014-06-19 20:11:00	@Espyo	could just be it acting silly
2014-06-19 20:11:09	@J	""" used at the start of a module or function is a documentation string
2014-06-19 20:11:25	@Espyo	ah, I see
2014-06-19 20:11:39	@Espyo	"source wiki file namespace id"
2014-06-19 20:11:41	@Espyo	the id number?
2014-06-19 20:11:48	@J	yeah
2014-06-19 20:11:54	@J	too lazy to look up by name
2014-06-19 20:12:25	@Espyo	I think it's static
2014-06-19 20:12:27	@Espyo	it's always 6
2014-06-19 20:12:35	@J	could be
2014-06-19 20:13:02	@Espyo	I think I read on the MediaWiki docs that it's always 6
2014-06-19 20:13:10	@Espyo	then again, servers could do whatever they please, I guess
2014-06-19 20:13:14	@Espyo	even re-create MediaWiki
2014-06-19 20:13:22	@Espyo	anyway, any precautions I should take before starting?

2014-06-19 20:30:10	@Espyo	fair enough
2014-06-19 20:30:41	@J	but it looks like you're failing to get edit tokens from the target wiki
2014-06-19 20:30:49	@J	there's no real error handling, so...
2014-06-19 20:31:27	@Espyo	on the user group rights page
2014-06-19 20:31:33	@Espyo	I could've sworn I read that bots get access to the write api
2014-06-19 20:31:43	@Espyo	maybe that's it? the bot isn't a bot user yet, I asked the dev to add him
2014-06-19 20:31:50	@Espyo	he didn't give me enough power to do so
2014-06-19 20:33:09	@J	not sure if you need anything special to have write access via the API beyond normal API access
2014-06-19 20:33:12	@Espyo	then again, it looks like "(all)" groups have access to the write api
2014-06-19 20:33:14	@J	*normal write access
2014-06-19 20:33:48	@J	could stick, before the line it crashes on:
2014-06-19 20:33:48	@J	        from xml.etree import ElementTree
2014-06-19 20:33:49	@J	        print ElementTree.tostring(tree)
2014-06-19 20:34:01	@J	making sure to preserve 8 spaces, not switch to tabs
2014-06-19 20:34:09	@J	that's after line 691
2014-06-19 20:34:27	@J	authentication should've worked, otherwise it would've told you
2014-06-19 20:34:38	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-19 20:35:03	@J	but yeah, one of these days I'll do all of this wiki stuff better
2014-06-19 20:35:09	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-19 20:35:17	@Espyo	though... I think I'd rather wait for him to set the bot to bot user
2014-06-19 20:35:20	@Espyo	or else the recent changes...
2014-06-19 20:35:40	@J	could test it with 1 file
2014-06-19 20:36:03	@Espyo	good point
2014-06-19 20:36:44	@Espyo	well, doesn't look like it crashed now
2014-06-19 20:37:09	@Espyo	but it didn't do anything on the wiki
2014-06-19 20:38:04	@Espyo	<api><query>(...)</query></api>
2014-06-19 20:38:04	@Espyo	        transferring files...
2014-06-19 20:38:04	@Espyo	 010 Editor - Hex dump.png
2014-06-19 20:38:11	@Espyo	oh, pfft
2014-06-19 20:38:18	@Espyo	when I said that it copied a lot more than it should've
2014-06-19 20:38:26	@Espyo	I thought it was copying the Python error as well
2014-06-19 20:38:31	@Espyo	turns out this is a Python error on my end
2014-06-19 20:38:38	@Espyo	I have a script that automatically colors my text blue
2014-06-19 20:38:52	@Espyo	except the HexChat API doesn't like messages that start with non-letters
2014-06-19 20:39:15	@Espyo	anyway, everything looks like it passed successfully, but...
2014-06-19 20:39:48	@J	not sure what you're talking about, but sure
2014-06-19 20:39:57	@J	and that's the whole output?
2014-06-19 20:42:23	@J	...well, it may be because there's no error checking
2014-06-19 20:42:29	@Espyo	http://pastebin.com/cK3H97LD
2014-06-19 20:42:50	@J	put print ElementTree.tostring(tree) above 'TODO: check for errors' too
2014-06-19 20:43:44	@Espyo	all right, when I copy-pasted the first error some minutes ago, I thought the windows terminal had copied the "Traceback (most recent call last):" thing too
2014-06-19 20:43:53	@Espyo	because when I pasted it, that message appeared on my HexChat
2014-06-19 20:44:11	@Espyo	but it turns out that that wasn't a Python error from your thing, it was a Python error from my coloring script, the error coming from within HexChat
2014-06-19 20:44:16	@J	heh
2014-06-19 20:44:33	@Espyo	ah, there we go
2014-06-19 20:44:47	@Espyo	the Carma wiki isn't allowing uploads via url
2014-06-19 20:44:50	@Espyo	I'll have to ask him
2014-06-19 20:44:55	@Espyo	*to enable it
2014-06-19 20:45:08	@J	anyway, I like how the other error just disappeared when you tried to find it
2014-06-19 20:45:09	@Espyo	<api><error code="copyuploaddisabled" info="Uploads by URL is not enabled. Make sure $wgAllowCopyUploads is set to true in LocalSettings.php." /></api>
2014-06-19 20:45:15	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-06-19 20:46:41	@Espyo	let me try three files
2014-06-19 20:47:40	@J	hmm, we can do it without
2014-06-19 20:48:00	@Espyo	by downloading onto the disk?
2014-06-19 20:48:08	@Espyo	I can already imagine the 300+ errors that'll show up
2014-06-19 20:48:17	@Espyo	but yeah, even with 3 files, the errors are the same, and we get no crashes
2014-06-19 20:48:23	@Espyo	...I'll take it, whatever
2014-06-19 21:33:58	@J	okay, this might work
2014-06-19 21:36:24	@J	I'm not sure if it's just the wiki I'm using, but I get lots of 'database query error's on upload, but the upload actually works
2014-06-19 21:39:55	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/transfer-img.tar.gz
2014-06-19 21:50:55	@Espyo	oh, a .tar.gz
2014-06-19 21:51:12	@Espyo	I can't remember if we talked about this, but the only way to extract these here is by extracting gz, then the tar
2014-06-19 21:54:06	@Espyo	well, still got no reply over making the bot a Bot user
2014-06-19 21:54:08	@Espyo	but I can still test
2014-06-19 21:54:09	@Espyo	let's see...
2014-06-19 21:54:54	@Espyo	oh, he changed the user rights an hour ago
2014-06-19 21:54:57	@Espyo	he just never told me
2014-06-19 21:55:25	@Espyo	but yeah, tried uploading again, no anything
2014-06-19 21:55:45	@Espyo	the output wrote the file name
2014-06-19 21:55:47	@Espyo	but that was it
2014-06-19 21:59:41	@J	and at the end it didn't say there were any failures?
2014-06-19 22:01:04	@J	because that means the server didn't send back any errors
2014-06-19 22:01:12	@J	I just tested a few and they worked fine
2014-06-19 22:01:58	@Espyo	it didn't
2014-06-19 22:02:04	@Espyo	drat
2014-06-19 22:02:51	@Espyo	with print ElementTree.tostring(tree), it didn't print anything else
2014-06-19 22:03:13	@Espyo	let me try deleting it
2014-06-19 22:03:20	@J	uh...
2014-06-19 22:03:26	@J	are you running the wrong file?
2014-06-19 22:03:37	@Espyo	DAMMIT
2014-06-19 22:03:44	@Espyo	I forgot bot changes are hidden
2014-06-19 22:03:56	@Espyo	it's working just fine
2014-06-19 22:04:00	@Espyo	I just wasn't /seeing/ the changes
2014-06-19 22:04:05	@J	hmm
2014-06-19 22:04:07	@Espyo	and it uploads a new version, if it already exists
2014-06-19 22:04:09	@Espyo	so that's always good
2014-06-19 22:04:15	@J	but if you added that line, it would crash
2014-06-19 22:04:29	@J	unless you also now have URL privileges, and you're using the old one
2014-06-19 22:06:36	@Espyo	I'm using the right file
2014-06-19 22:06:42	@Espyo	let me double check
2014-06-19 22:06:45	@Espyo	the right mwbot, I mean
2014-06-19 22:06:50	@Espyo	and the actual script too
2014-06-19 22:06:56	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-06-19 22:06:59	@Espyo	I'm debugging the engine
2014-06-19 22:07:05	@Espyo	that makes it so that windows cannot show me the desktop
2014-06-19 22:07:08	@Espyo	because why the hell not
2014-06-19 22:07:34	@Espyo	nope, all files are updated with the ones you sent me
2014-06-19 22:08:04	@Espyo	hm, I can see that it would crash, but...
2014-06-19 22:08:05	@Espyo	it didn't
2014-06-19 22:08:10	@J	oh
2014-06-19 22:08:13	@J	I'm silly
2014-06-19 22:08:20	@J	you're not even calling transfer_files any more
2014-06-19 22:08:24	@J	so of course it does nothing
2014-06-19 22:08:25	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-19 22:08:35	@Espyo	all right, that explains that
2014-06-19 22:08:44	@Espyo	let's see if it can handle images fine, then
2014-06-19 22:08:51	@J	on the topic of Windows
2014-06-19 22:09:06	@J	if you have AltDrag, that thing I probably linked you to at some point
2014-06-19 22:09:29	@J	you can tell that show desktop doesn't hide windows, it puts an overlay over the top
2014-06-19 22:09:34	@J	because you can move that overlay
2014-06-19 22:09:50	@Espyo	looks like your script doesn't like a starting file other than ""
2014-06-19 22:10:04	@J	also, you can move the start menu, and you can move that icon on the start menu separately
2014-06-19 22:10:10	@Espyo	hmm, neat
2014-06-19 22:10:12	@J	doesn't like = crashes?

2014-06-19 22:11:39	@J	I didn't modify that function, so it's still old and...crumbly?
2014-06-19 22:11:58	@Espyo	fragile
2014-06-19 22:12:23	@J	crumbly
2014-06-19 22:12:39	@J	the ? was more questioning my sanity than my choice of words
2014-06-19 22:12:40	@Espyo	crumbly is too bread-like
2014-06-19 22:12:47	@J	anyway
2014-06-19 22:12:48	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-06-19 22:13:12	@J	yeah, weird that MW isn't giving you a continue back
2014-06-19 22:13:27	@J	what did you pass for starting file?
2014-06-19 22:15:12	@Espyo	 010 Editor - Structure analysis (2013-02-09 1247).png
2014-06-19 22:15:16	@Espyo	too many ugly characters?
2014-06-19 22:15:33	@Espyo	maybe it needs to convert the likes of the parenthesis
2014-06-19 22:15:53	@J	should be fine, but I get it too
2014-06-19 22:16:32	@Espyo	well, it's not a big worry
2014-06-19 22:16:36	@Espyo	it's only the first file, at any rate
2014-06-19 22:16:49	@Espyo	but if it fails on the second to last one, and I need to continue from there later...
2014-06-19 22:20:42	@J	yeah
2014-06-19 22:24:00	@J	actually, it happens for start = '', so long as the limit is large or unset
2014-06-19 22:24:11	@J	and it seems like a MediaWiki version thing
2014-06-19 22:24:35	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-19 22:24:38	@Espyo	weird then
2014-06-19 22:29:00	@Espyo	but now what can we do
2014-06-19 22:29:05	@Espyo	and why was it working fine before?
2014-06-19 22:29:08	@J	...okay, there are a lot of files on there
2014-06-19 22:29:12	@Espyo	it was returning a list of files just fine
2014-06-19 22:29:14	@J	you probably specified limit every time
2014-06-19 22:29:20	@Espyo	I never
2014-06-19 22:29:31	@J	this is going to take you like 5 days
2014-06-19 22:29:46	@J	well, I don't know
2014-06-19 22:29:49	@J	but I've got it working
2014-06-19 22:29:52	@Espyo	it does it one by one, right?
2014-06-19 22:30:18	@Espyo	well, Pikipedia had around this number of pictures, did it take you 5 days?
2014-06-19 22:32:15	@J	hmm, I get the impression there are lots more images here
2014-06-19 22:32:22	@J	and I could use URL, which is faster
2014-06-19 22:32:37	@J	but hey, give it a go and see how long it's taking
2014-06-19 22:32:47	@Espyo	use URL? it already uses URL
2014-06-19 22:32:52	@Espyo	but wait, I can't, it's not working
2014-06-19 22:32:54	@J	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikn/python-modules/master/mwbot.py
2014-06-19 22:32:56	@J	new mwbot
2014-06-19 22:33:04	@Espyo	like you said, if the start is empty, and the limit is unset, it's crashing
2014-06-19 22:33:09	@Espyo	even though it wasn't, earlier today
2014-06-19 22:33:15	@J	it doesn't use URL because you don't have the rights
2014-06-19 22:33:25	@Espyo	RIP release 4
2014-06-19 22:33:32	@Espyo	on the new wiki?
2014-06-19 22:33:35	@Espyo	he already added them
2014-06-19 22:33:37	@J	ah
2014-06-19 22:33:49	@Espyo	did I forget to mention it?
2014-06-19 22:33:50	@J	then you can go back to the previous version of thing.py and it should be faster
2014-06-19 22:34:06	@J	though possibly less stable

2014-06-21 13:05:21	@Espyo	well, the images imported fine
2014-06-21 13:05:28	@Espyo	having an undefined limit still doesn't work
2014-06-21 13:05:34	@Espyo	but I just did 100 at a time, didn't take me long
2014-06-21 13:05:38	@Espyo	thanks a lot for your help, J
2014-06-21 13:28:16	@J	hmm, strange
2014-06-21 13:28:37	@J	well, that can be fixed next time
2014-06-21 13:28:47	@J	I'm sure it worked here though (I was reading from the same wiki)
2014-06-21 13:34:27	@Espyo	I waited like 10 minutes for it to retrieve the list
2014-06-21 13:34:40	@Espyo	when I just ask for it to retrieve 100, it takes it like 3 seconds to get it
2014-06-21 13:37:02	@Espyo	oh, and two other things to add to the next version's todo list
2014-06-21 13:37:16	@Espyo	the messages start with a lowercase letter, shame on you
2014-06-21 13:37:28	@Espyo	second, write a message saying that it's fetching the list of files
2014-06-21 13:37:45	@Espyo	because there were 10 or so times where I started the script and went off to do something else
2014-06-21 13:37:59	@Espyo	only to come back later and realize that I didn't tell the script to import the images it got
2014-06-21 13:38:11	@Espyo	it was just there waiting for me to press enter
2014-06-21 13:44:21	@J	oh, yeah, I saw it take ages too; I thought you meant it still crashed
2014-06-21 13:44:54	@J	I guess if it takes longer than getting all the sets of 100, it's not grabbing the 'continue' field properly
2014-06-21 13:45:13	@J	[13:37:16] @Espyo the messages start with a lowercase letter, shame on you
2014-06-21 13:45:18	@J	this is sensible and correct
2014-06-21 13:45:26	@Espyo	never
2014-06-21 13:45:33	@J	always
2014-06-21 13:45:37	@Espyo	no, I'm sure it crashed
2014-06-21 13:45:41	@J	lowercase > uppercase in every situation
2014-06-21 13:45:49	@Espyo	even after 10 minutes it didn't fetch anything
2014-06-21 13:45:56	@J	yeah, but not immediately, like before
2014-06-21 13:45:58	@Espyo	you can't shout with lowercase
2014-06-21 13:46:08	@Espyo	well, no Python crash
2014-06-21 13:46:14	@Espyo	but... something had to crash somewhere
2014-06-21 13:46:17	@J	right
2014-06-21 13:46:25	@Espyo	I mean, 10 minutes, really?
2014-06-21 13:46:25	@J	I'm thinking more infinite loop
2014-06-21 13:46:29	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2014-06-21 13:46:33	@Espyo	if fetching 100 takes 3 seconds
2014-06-21 13:46:43	@J	but a network-based infinite loop, so no 100% CPU
2014-06-21 13:46:44	@Espyo	and we only had... less than 2000 images
2014-06-21 13:46:47	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-21 13:46:52	@Espyo	anyway, lunch, brb
2014-06-21 13:47:19	@J	it starts printing image names when it transfers them, doesn't it?
2014-06-21 13:48:08	@J	oh, list fetching
2014-06-21 13:48:09	@J	I see
2014-06-21 13:48:29	@J	wait
2014-06-21 13:48:54	@J	you mean it was waiting for you to answer one of the questions?
2014-06-21 14:07:55	@Espyo	no, those are different things
2014-06-21 14:08:13	@Espyo	one thing is that when I don't set the limit, I can sit there and wait, and wait, and wait, and it'll never fetch the list of files
2014-06-21 14:08:26	@Espyo	another thing is that sometimes, I start the script, and forget to wait for the list + press enter
2014-06-21 14:08:31	@Espyo	I just start the script and go do something else
2014-06-21 14:08:57	@Espyo	if there was a message saying "fetching list...", something in my mind would at least tick that I have to wait a sec before doing something else
2014-06-21 14:09:01	@Espyo	dunno, maybe it's just me
2014-06-21 14:09:12	@Espyo	well, it's definitely just me, if us two are the only ones who used this tool, but...
2014-06-21 14:15:44	@J	oh
2014-06-21 17:37:23	<--	Miles (Miles@h-47-72-682-095.hsd2.ga.comcast.net) has quit
2014-06-21 18:09:09	@J	so I finally got around to playing Psychonauts
2014-06-21 18:10:42	@J	kind of surprised by how many old it feels, what with all the collection quests, and bosses with stages and patterns
2014-06-21 18:10:59	@J	or maybe action adventure games are still like that and I just don't really play them any more
2014-06-21 18:16:52	@Espyo	"how many old"?
2014-06-21 18:16:58	@Espyo	but yeah
2014-06-21 18:17:00	@Espyo	it is an old game
2014-06-21 18:17:02	@Espyo	 2001, I think?
2014-06-21 18:17:13	@Espyo	but it's still amazing
2014-06-21 18:33:58	@J	what
2014-06-21 18:34:01	@J	how did I type that
2014-06-21 18:34:06	@J	I checked, 2005
2014-06-21 18:35:07	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-21 18:35:54	@J	I guess around the same time as Twilight Princess
2014-06-21 18:36:23	@Espyo	yeah
2014-06-21 18:36:26	@J	...which still feels recent, somehow, though it's been 9 years
2014-06-21 18:36:31	@J	that's way too long
2014-06-21 18:36:35	@Espyo	I know what you mean
2014-06-21 18:36:43	@Espyo	feels like 5 or 6 years
2014-06-21 18:41:42	@J	anyway, yeah, obviously the main draws are the variety of locations and the humour/characters
2014-06-21 18:41:50	@J	but some things feel kind of wrong
2014-06-21 18:42:20	@J	for example, today I played that boss fight with the leader of the girls who collect cookies, protecting the milk man
2014-06-21 18:42:41	@J	halfway through, it goes dark and you have to view the fight from her point of view
2014-06-21 18:43:10	@Espyo	or take wild shots, that works too
2014-06-21 18:43:11	@J	but suddenly, for no apparent reason, the thing that damages her has changed
2014-06-21 18:43:28	@J	telekinesis on the cookie bombs no longer works
2014-06-21 18:43:45	@J	and just lots of things like that
2014-06-21 18:43:51	@Espyo	I remember the fight, but I can't really remember what she does on the second phase
2014-06-21 18:43:58	@Espyo	but doesn't she attack with shurikens on the 2nd?
2014-06-21 18:47:07	@J	she does that on both
2014-06-21 18:47:28	@J	in the 1st phase, I used telekineses to throw the bombs back at her
2014-06-21 18:47:28	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-06-21 18:47:38	@J	in the 2nd, I tried that, but it didn't seem to do anything
2014-06-21 18:47:52	@J	so I started shooting, and I still don't understand why shooting the bombs damaged her anyway
2014-06-21 18:48:35	@J	I also don't really like how the camera auto-centres itself vertically as you move
2014-06-21 18:48:48	@J	there's an option to turn off damping, but it only seems to work while you're standing still
2014-06-21 18:49:03	@Espyo	hm, I think I vaguely remember that boss fight being a bit weird
2014-06-21 18:49:10	@Espyo	and then I saw a speedrun and nothing made sense, but that's besides the point
2014-06-21 18:50:05	@J	it's just an example
2014-06-21 18:50:24	@J	a little earlier, there's that hedged area with the flowers in
2014-06-21 18:51:06	@J	you use clairvoyance to see from the point of view of a crow and learn that the main gate opens and closes when you go through a side gate
2014-06-21 18:51:26	@J	but it took me a while to work out what was going on because I wasn't even using the side gate, I was just jumping over it
2014-06-21 18:52:02	@Espyo	ugh, same here
2014-06-21 18:52:07	@Espyo	that part I admit is just horrible
2014-06-21 18:52:13	@J	and besides things like that, at times it gets near the standard adventure game 'try all the items on all the things'
2014-06-21 18:52:15	@Espyo	I got stuck there for hours
2014-06-21 18:52:25	@Espyo	a bit, yeah
2014-06-21 18:52:34	@J	but then, I guess that's just part of the genre
2014-06-21 18:52:59	@J	yeah, I know I don't like some aspects adventure games
2014-06-21 18:53:02	@Espyo	plus, it's Tim Schafer
2014-06-21 18:53:06	@J	logical puzzles are much better
2014-06-21 18:53:13	@Espyo	yeah
2014-06-21 18:54:20	@J	I sound negative, but I am enjoying it
2014-06-21 18:54:38	@Espyo	that's all that matters
2014-06-21 18:54:50	@J	gah, Steam annoys me too: it remembers how your games are sorted, but only on one column
2014-06-21 18:54:58	@J	you can sort on two columns, but it gets lost on restart
2014-06-21 18:55:33	@J	(I want to sort by 'status' (whether it's installed) then 'last played')
2014-06-21 18:59:29	@J	in other news, I've been using Uzbl more, and I set ,/. to switch tabs, and it works really well
2014-06-21 18:59:42	@Espyo	didn't even know you could sort them
2014-06-21 19:00:03	@J	I use the list view
2014-06-21 19:00:08	@Espyo	I'd rather ctrl+(shift+)tab as usual
2014-06-21 19:00:11	@J	probably can't if you don't have the columns
2014-06-21 19:00:23	@J	but that's so much mork effort
2014-06-21 19:00:28	@Espyo	oh, I see
2014-06-21 19:00:31	@Espyo	it is, but eh
2014-06-21 19:00:32	@J	also, ,. are on we for me
2014-06-21 19:01:53	@Espyo	wha
2014-06-21 19:02:00	@Espyo	below 2 and 3?
2014-06-21 19:02:24	@J	yeah
2014-06-21 19:02:33	@Espyo	but I thought...
2014-06-21 19:02:44	@Espyo	I thought all letters were still in the place of letters
2014-06-21 19:02:49	@Espyo	just mixed about
2014-06-21 19:02:50	@J	no
2014-06-21 19:03:01	@J	mostly, yes
2014-06-21 19:03:13	@J	but, for example, ; becomes s because then the home row is all letters
2014-06-21 19:03:51	@J	the /,. keys move to the top-left (comparing to a normal UK layout)
2014-06-21 19:04:00	@Espyo	mhm
2014-06-21 19:04:12	@J	other than that, all punctuation stays as punctuation
2014-06-21 19:04:20	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-06-21 19:04:39	@J	I believe there's also a Dvorak layout that rearranges the numbers, putting more common ones in the middle or something
2014-06-21 19:05:24	@Espyo	eh, number commonness is kinda debatable

2014-06-24 18:47:10	@J	so someone at work ragequit today
2014-06-24 18:47:21	@J	because someone said their code was dodgy
2014-06-24 19:21:17	@Espyo	woah what
2014-06-24 19:21:21	@Espyo	ragequit for the day, or...?
2014-06-24 19:34:08	@J	I'm not entirely sure, because they work in a different part of the company and we communicate via IRC
2014-06-24 19:34:34	@J	so really just quit the server, not sure whether they actually left
2014-06-24 19:36:01	@Espyo	hehe
2014-06-24 19:36:14	@Espyo	can you give me a quick version of what was wrong with the code?
2014-06-24 19:37:30	@J	oh, I don't even know
2014-06-24 19:37:58	@J	something about not tracking process IDs of spawned processes very reliably
2014-06-25 02:04:08	@Espyo	Testyo: memo J someone from #tcrf needs help with wwdumpsnd
2014-06-25 02:04:08	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for J saying: someone from #tcrf needs help with wwdumpsnd.

2014-06-25 20:11:21	@Espyo	how weird

2014-06-25 20:11:45	@Espyo	because the e-mail sounded like it was a new feature they were debuting

2014-06-25 22:11:35	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-25 22:11:50	@Espyo	the guy can't extract the .aw files after w_Scene4.aw
2014-06-25 22:11:54	@Espyo	any ideas?
2014-06-25 22:12:05	@Espyo	I can't even extract w_Scene1.aw and after
2014-06-25 22:18:33	@J	I can't remember how it works
2014-06-25 22:18:52	@J	don't you just rename one of files, then run that program and everything works
2014-06-25 22:19:10	@Espyo	yeah, that's the theory...
2014-06-25 22:19:24	@Espyo	lemme try one of the other files again, see what the program says exactly
2014-06-25 22:19:56	@J	what do you start with?  The .aw, or is that an intermediate stage?
2014-06-25 22:21:33	@Espyo	working...
2014-06-25 22:21:34	@Espyo	error parsing .aw file
2014-06-25 22:21:34	@Espyo	dump failed
2014-06-25 22:21:38	@Espyo	that's all...
2014-06-25 22:21:50	@Espyo	the program needs an .aaf and a .aw
2014-06-25 22:21:56	@Espyo	the .aaf needs a rename
2014-06-25 22:21:57	@J	just tried it and it worked fine
2014-06-25 22:22:11	@Espyo	(also I just realized that I wrote AN aaf and A aw, so ignore that)
2014-06-25 22:22:14	@Espyo	on a VM?
2014-06-25 22:22:30	@Espyo	and which version of Pikmin 2?
2014-06-25 22:22:39	@Espyo	I tried 23, from the US version
2014-06-25 22:22:49	@J	http://sprunge.us/BhPg
2014-06-25 22:22:54	@J	those are my md5sums
2014-06-25 22:23:18	@Espyo	pffft
2014-06-25 22:23:20	@Espyo	silly J
2014-06-25 22:23:25	@Espyo	I can't just check an md5 on windows
2014-06-25 22:23:32	@Espyo	at least, not without external tools
2014-06-25 22:23:36	@J	you have Git Bash, which bundles md5sum
2014-06-25 22:23:40	@Espyo	oh yeah...
2014-06-25 22:23:45	@J	md5sum -c <file>
2014-06-25 22:23:45	@Espyo	also, if you stick all of them in, it might start with 0, and 0 looks like it works
2014-06-25 22:23:54	@Espyo	but until it finishes 0, it won't go to the other oens
2014-06-25 22:23:55	@Espyo	*ones
2014-06-25 22:23:56	@J	<file> being the file I linked
2014-06-25 22:23:59	@Espyo	so try making it start with 1
2014-06-25 22:24:17	@J	wait, what?
2014-06-25 22:24:43	@Espyo	if you start the extractor with multiple .aw files on the folder
2014-06-25 22:24:45	@Espyo	it'll do them one by one
2014-06-25 22:24:50	@Espyo	 0 works fine, probably
2014-06-25 22:24:54	@Espyo	but 1 doesn't
2014-06-25 22:25:03	@J	I get wavs for all of them
2014-06-25 22:25:06	@Espyo	and I'm guessing you saw it do 0, canceled, and assumed it was working fine
2014-06-25 22:25:11	@Espyo	wait, in such a small time?
2014-06-25 22:25:12	@J	http://sprunge.us/WULK
2014-06-25 22:25:14	@J	yeah
2014-06-25 22:25:20	@Espyo	it takes me over a minute to extract 0...
2014-06-25 22:25:27	@J	let me time it
2014-06-25 22:25:35	@Espyo	how in the world...
2014-06-25 22:25:38	@Espyo	is this in a windows VM?
2014-06-25 22:25:44	@J	.754s
2014-06-25 22:25:51	@Espyo	you're joking
2014-06-25 22:25:51	@J	no, I compiled for LInux
2014-06-25 22:25:53	@J	*Linux
2014-06-25 22:25:57	@Espyo	simple enough
2014-06-25 22:26:00	@Espyo	but still, you're joking
2014-06-25 22:26:30	@J	the whole folder is 28M before any extraction; does that sound right?
2014-06-25 22:26:31	Testyo	28 m = 30.6208 yd / 91.8624 ft / 1473.68 Olimar-heights / 4666.65 TRY-heights
2014-06-25 22:29:09	@Espyo	uh, not really
2014-06-25 22:29:26	@Espyo	wait, not necessarily
2014-06-25 22:29:33	@Espyo	the .ogg files you gave me a long time ago make up 20MB
2014-06-25 22:29:45	@Espyo	sure, .ogg is smaller, but we're talking about the compressed .aw files...
2014-06-25 22:29:49	@J	that's not a great comparison point
2014-06-25 22:30:01	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-06-25 22:30:10	@J	what is the size of the folder containing .aw files 0 to 48, plus the aaf?
2014-06-25 22:30:32	@Espyo	 27 MB prior to extraction, the extra 1 MB must be the aaf
2014-06-25 22:31:13	@Espyo	aw + aaf = 27.4MB
2014-06-25 22:31:29	@J	yeah, sounds the same
2014-06-25 22:31:55	@J	so I guess my CPU's just faster
2014-06-25 22:32:10	@J	or it could be disk
2014-06-25 22:33:19	@Espyo	really don't know
2014-06-25 22:33:24	@Espyo	must be CPU
2014-06-25 22:33:29	@Espyo	plus the way Linux handles filesystems
2014-06-25 22:33:57	@Espyo	I mean, if yours takes a second for all, and mine takes a minute for one, it CAN'T be the disk
2014-06-25 22:34:05	@Espyo	it if it were, my disk would be too slow to use
2014-06-25 22:34:28	@Espyo	a thing I found out while debugging the engine: the windows console is very laggy if it has to input several lines
2014-06-25 22:34:33	@Espyo	that's not the case here, but just saying
2014-06-25 22:35:12	@J	oh
2014-06-25 22:35:26	@J	yeah, Windows is ridiculously slow with any operation involving many files
2014-06-25 22:36:02	@J	like just copying a folder with thousands of files, even if it's only a few tens of MiB total
2014-06-25 22:36:07	@J	takes a long time
2014-06-25 22:36:28	@Espyo	on a console, yes
2014-06-25 22:36:30	@J	deleting too
2014-06-25 22:36:38	@J	with the file manager too
2014-06-25 22:36:41	@Espyo	not really
2014-06-25 22:36:52	@J	when I say a long time, I mean more than a minute
2014-06-25 22:36:57	@Espyo	if I need to move a 1GB folder from one spot on my computer to another, it happens in less than a second
2014-06-25 22:37:16	@J	with how many files?
2014-06-25 22:37:23	@Espyo	this is from memory
2014-06-25 22:37:27	@Espyo	err, 1?
2014-06-25 22:37:30	@Espyo	loads of files take longer, sure
2014-06-25 22:37:35	@Espyo	but not /minutes/
2014-06-25 22:37:35	@J	that was the point
2014-06-25 22:37:38	@J	[22:36:02] @J like just copying a folder with thousands of files, even if it's only a few tens of MiB total
2014-06-25 22:37:43	@Espyo	yeah, but here's the thing...
2014-06-25 22:37:53	@Espyo	if I try a move operation through the console
2014-06-25 22:38:00	@Espyo	it takes over 10 times more
2014-06-25 22:38:13	@J	move should be instant
2014-06-25 22:38:13	@Espyo	I have a script set up that backs up some important documents every week
2014-06-25 22:38:22	@Espyo	yeah, /should/
2014-06-25 22:38:26	@J	oh, copy, you mean?
2014-06-25 22:38:27	@Espyo	in this case, the script copies
2014-06-25 22:38:31	@Espyo	in this case, yeah
2014-06-25 22:38:32	@J	yeah, move != copy
2014-06-25 22:38:36	@Espyo	yes, yes
2014-06-25 22:38:43	@Espyo	I kinda switched topics
2014-06-25 22:38:45	@J	with Windows cmd or Git Bash?
2014-06-25 22:38:51	@Espyo	windows
2014-06-25 22:38:55	@J	hmm
2014-06-25 22:39:10	@Espyo	several reasons: the script works without installing git, for one thing
2014-06-25 22:39:11	@J	perhaps Windows command-line stuff is poorly optimised because no-one uses it
2014-06-25 22:39:20	@Espyo	but it's the only way to script things
2014-06-25 22:39:26	@Espyo	again, besides Git Bash and actually making a program
2014-06-25 22:39:31	@J	yeah, I know
2014-06-25 22:39:55	@Espyo	it's not as used as scripting in Linux, but scripting is still a major thing anywhere
2014-06-25 22:39:56	@J	also, I would suspect Git Bash would be slow too, because none of it is optimised for Windows, just the minimum is done to get it to work
2014-06-25 22:40:14	@Espyo	but yeah, when I need to copy a folder with, say, 500 files, and 500 MB, on the file manager, it takes maybe two seconds
2014-06-25 22:40:20	@J	anyway, point was, Windows is slow with lots of files, and I stand by that
2014-06-25 22:40:22	@Espyo	on the console, it takes two minutes
2014-06-25 22:40:45	@Espyo	it probably is
2014-06-25 22:41:04	@Espyo	I don't usually move or copy files with a huge number of files
2014-06-25 22:41:26	@Espyo	and... to be frank, I can't really remember the stuff I move and copy
2014-06-25 22:41:31	@Espyo	so I can't really compare on a whim
2014-06-25 22:41:37	@J	hmm, just checked, and wwdumpsnd is only generating ~2300 files here
2014-06-25 22:41:49	@Espyo	and I'm not creating a folder just to check, it's a silly thing to do for a failure operative system
2014-06-25 22:41:55	@Espyo	what were we even talking about, anyway?
2014-06-25 22:42:01	@J	wwdumpsnd being slow
2014-06-25 22:42:07	@Espyo	ah, that
2014-06-25 22:42:12	@Espyo	hmm, a file cap somewhere?
2014-06-25 22:42:55	@Espyo	anyway, what version of the game?
2014-06-25 22:44:41	@J	US
2014-06-25 22:44:45	@J	not sure what you meant by 23
2014-06-25 22:44:49	@Espyo	how weird then
2014-06-25 22:45:07	@Espyo	uh, I meant I tried w_Scene23.aw when the program gave the error
2014-06-25 22:45:51	@J	'tried'?  Tried doing what with it?
2014-06-25 22:46:11	@Espyo	tried extracting the .wavs with wwdumpsnd, of course
2014-06-25 22:46:33	@J	I mean, how can you do it one file?
2014-06-25 22:46:42	@Espyo	just... have that file on the wwdumpsnd folder
2014-06-25 22:46:45	@J	oh
2014-06-25 22:46:48	@Espyo	no other file
2014-06-25 22:46:48	@J	yeah, that won't work
2014-06-25 22:46:51	@J	you need them all
2014-06-25 22:46:51	@Espyo	what
2014-06-25 22:46:56	@Espyo	when was this a thing
2014-06-25 22:47:00	@J	it uses the aaf to know what wSound to use
2014-06-25 22:47:12	@J	they're indexed in there
2014-06-25 22:47:12	@Espyo	what is this nonsense
2014-06-25 22:47:18	@Espyo	makes sense, but
2014-06-25 22:47:24	@Espyo	why wasn't this written anywhere else?
2014-06-25 22:47:30	@J	hey, if I knew you were crazy, I would've mentioned this earlier
2014-06-25 22:47:50	@Espyo	how could I have possibly known?
2014-06-25 22:48:02	@J	hmm, not sure
2014-06-25 22:48:08	@Espyo	well there you go
2014-06-25 22:48:10	@J	I guess I just assumed it was obvious
2014-06-25 22:48:16	@Espyo	maybe in hindsight
2014-06-25 22:48:23	@Espyo	but I have no idea how the audio is stored in that format
2014-06-25 22:48:27	@Espyo	could just as easily be non-indexed
2014-06-25 22:49:31	@Espyo	but yeah, I'll tell him that
2014-06-25 22:49:33	@Espyo	and that should work
2014-06-25 22:49:44	@Espyo	plus, I'm linking to my talk page discussion on the TCRF notes page
2014-06-25 22:49:53	@Espyo	so other people don't have to go through all this mess
2014-06-25 22:49:57	@Espyo	thanks for the help
2014-06-25 22:51:45	@J	no problem

2014-06-28 19:46:34	@J	just about to make dinner, though
2014-06-28 19:46:39	@Espyo	dammit
2014-06-28 19:46:41	@Espyo	it's quick, though
2014-06-28 19:46:58	@Espyo	the "closest Pikmin" icons on Pikmin 2 have the Pikmin inside a bubble
2014-06-28 19:47:03	@Espyo	the texture has the bubble included
2014-06-28 19:47:11	@Espyo	I used Gimp to crop only the Pikmin
2014-06-28 19:47:16	@Espyo	but it leaves a gradient to white
2014-06-28 19:47:26	@Espyo	like so https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Blue_bud.png
2014-06-28 19:47:37	@Espyo	any idea on how to remove the white gradient?
2014-06-28 19:47:56	@Espyo	the closest I've gotten was colors/map/switch colors
2014-06-28 19:48:07	@Espyo	but I think there's some glitch on my version
2014-06-28 19:48:15	@Espyo	you need to use the gray colors tab
2014-06-28 19:48:29	@Espyo	the circle there defines the final color
2014-06-28 19:48:36	@Espyo	I can set the saturation just fine
2014-06-28 19:48:45	@Espyo	but whatever I do, the hue is set to 2 at all times
2014-06-28 19:48:53	@Espyo	which sucks, because I want a pretty much /exact/ color
2014-06-28 19:55:53	@J	hmm, I'm not sure
2014-06-28 19:56:44	@Espyo	at the very least, could you tell me if your color wheel does the same, on that dialog?
2014-06-28 19:56:59	@Espyo	just click and drag all around the wheel
2014-06-28 19:57:10	@Espyo	the saturation should change, but does the hue?
2014-06-28 19:57:19	@Espyo	I mean, the value on the two textboxes below
2014-06-28 19:58:38	@J	it does
2014-06-28 19:58:50	@Espyo	the hue changes?
2014-06-28 19:58:53	@J	if you meant 'Rotate Colours'
2014-06-28 19:59:01	@Espyo	err, yes, rotate colors
2014-06-28 19:59:16	@Espyo	mine's ALWAYS 2
2014-06-28 19:59:30	@Espyo	wait...
2014-06-28 19:59:39	@Espyo	on the far right side of the color wheel
2014-06-28 19:59:40	@J	oh, the 2nd tab?
2014-06-28 19:59:47	@Espyo	yeah, the 2nd tab
2014-06-28 20:00:01	@Espyo	on the far right of the wheel, there are a few positions that make the hue have values lower than 2
2014-06-28 20:02:10	@J	yeah, I don't know, it's kind of weird
2014-06-28 20:02:50	@Espyo	surely it had to go from 360 to 0
2014-06-28 20:02:58	@Espyo	'cause that's how it works elsewhere on GIMP
2014-06-28 20:03:07	@Espyo	if I use this dialog, I can get exactly what I want
2014-06-28 20:03:15	@Espyo	the problem is getting the color of the Pikmin right
2014-06-28 20:03:22	@Espyo	I have to click on the wheel and hope for the best
2014-06-28 20:03:38	@Espyo	if the hue box was working properly, I could just use the Pikmin's hue and saturation
2014-06-28 20:03:48	@Espyo	I guess I'll let them know of this glitch...
2014-06-28 20:03:55	@Espyo	I mean, it has to be a glitch
2014-06-28 20:06:31	@J	maybe
2014-06-28 20:06:36	@J	that whole dialogue confuses me
2014-06-28 20:08:08	@Espyo	same
2014-06-28 20:08:14	@Espyo	I just know that what works works
2014-06-28 20:08:20	@J	you could try decreasing lightness and colourise?
2014-06-28 20:08:26	@J	not really sure what you're going for
2014-06-28 20:08:28	@J	anyway, food
2014-06-28 20:10:14	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-28 20:11:56	@Espyo	great, now I can't create an account on Bugzilla
2014-06-28 20:12:00	@Espyo	anything else? geez
2014-06-28 20:30:38	@J	I think I already have an account there, if it's the Gnome one
2014-06-28 20:31:54	@Espyo	it is
2014-06-28 20:32:00	@Espyo	could you submit it?
2014-06-28 20:32:15	@Espyo	the info is straightforward
2014-06-28 20:32:34	@Espyo	on the gray options tab of the colors/map/rotate colors dialog
2014-06-28 20:32:50	@Espyo	the hue value box under the color wheel is capped at 2, when it should be capped at 360
2014-06-28 20:33:08	@Espyo	I can't find when the last version of GIMP was released
2014-06-28 20:46:32	@Espyo	oh!
2014-06-28 20:46:34	@Espyo	I found a solution
2014-06-28 20:46:48	@Espyo	on the third tab, you can switch what unit type to use for the color wheel
2014-06-28 20:46:53	@Espyo	radians or degrees
2014-06-28 20:47:05	@Espyo	switching to anything will make the wheel act like it should
2014-06-28 20:47:11	@Espyo	I mean, the hue value act like it should

2014-06-29 19:02:53	@J	I started playing Kerbal Space Program this weekend
2014-06-29 19:02:56	@J	it's really addictive
2014-06-29 19:03:21	@J	my greatest triumph so far is landing a rocket on the moon that still had plenty of fuel
2014-06-29 19:03:30	@J	but it landed on a slope and fell over
2014-06-29 19:03:55	@Espyo	pfft
2014-06-29 19:04:02	@Espyo	I saw some gameplay at one point
2014-06-29 19:04:05	@Espyo	it really does look fun
2014-06-29 19:04:11	@Espyo	but you have to invest yourself in it to get anywhere
2014-06-29 19:04:16	@J	yeah
2014-06-29 19:04:29	@J	it seems pretty resource-intensive too
2014-06-29 19:04:53	@J	though I did increase all the settings before playing
2014-06-29 19:05:07	@J	...and apparently I've played 13 hours
2014-06-29 19:07:12	@J	oh, and I like the fact that rockets don't go away
2014-06-29 19:07:23	@J	you end up with loads stranded in random orbits, out of fuel
2014-06-29 19:07:39	@J	and apparently the kerbals don't die of starvation
2014-06-29 19:07:59	@Espyo	they only die of death
2014-06-29 19:08:09	@Espyo	and they look like they die of overexcitement
2014-06-29 19:08:11	@J	I have one just going around the sun for eternity
2014-06-29 19:08:13	@Espyo	I would too, in their place, but yeah
2014-06-29 19:08:28	@Espyo	doesn't sound like something you could do on OUR sun
2014-06-29 19:08:42	@J	why?
2014-06-29 19:09:19	@Espyo	in order to get so close that you'd spin around its orbit uncontrollably, you'd boil
2014-06-29 19:09:19	@Espyo	right?
2014-06-29 19:09:33	@J	'uncontrollably'?
2014-06-29 19:09:47	@Espyo	<J> I have one just going around the sun for eternity
2014-06-29 19:10:10	@Espyo	if he's there forever, I guess you mean he can't escape the gravity
2014-06-29 19:10:29	@J	well, he has no fuel but is in a stable orbit
2014-06-29 19:10:34	@J	much like all the planets
2014-06-29 19:10:42	@Espyo	hence, spinning uncontrollably
2014-06-29 19:11:08	@Espyo	could you send another rocket to knock him out of the orbit?
2014-06-29 19:11:38	@J	yeah, that's possibly
2014-06-29 19:11:41	@J	*possible
2014-06-29 19:11:45	@Espyo	hah, nice
2014-06-29 19:12:42	@J	I'm not too sure how docking works, but I think you need a docking thing on both sides, so I probably couldn't add an extra fuel tank
2014-06-29 19:12:53	@Espyo	right
2014-06-29 19:13:07	@J	I could save the pilot, though, by moving him into another rocket
2014-06-29 19:13:24	@Espyo	but that's not as fun as rocket billiards
2014-06-29 19:14:16	@J	true
2014-06-29 19:15:04	@J	but it would have to be more of a gentle push than a collision, since most parts have pretty low explosion thresholds
2014-06-29 19:15:34	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-06-29 19:15:35	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-29 19:15:48	@Espyo	you're just risking getting two rockets stuck at that point
2014-06-29 19:18:44	@J	or many bits of rockets
2014-06-29 19:19:05	@Espyo	I meant slowly
2014-06-29 19:19:09	@Espyo	two rockets slowly, many bits fast
2014-06-29 19:27:48	@J	but slowly is hard
2014-06-29 19:28:17	@J	I'm not sure if there's even a way to display your velocity as relative to another rocket
2014-06-29 19:28:47	@Espyo	there shouldn't
2014-06-29 19:47:33	@J	why not?
2014-06-29 19:47:34	@J	 /late
2014-06-29 19:47:52	@Espyo	oddly specific thing to have on the dashboard
2014-06-29 20:03:02	@J	not if you're trying to dock
2014-06-29 20:03:18	@Espyo	oh, I didn't think of that
2014-06-29 20:03:19	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-06-29 20:03:21	@J	uh, actually, I just remembered there's a whole docking mode/controls

2014-06-29 22:44:56	@Espyo	J: did you ever submit the bug report for GIMP?
2014-06-29 22:47:13	Miles	Um
2014-06-29 22:47:15	Miles	6 hours ago?
2014-06-29 22:47:19	@Espyo	what
2014-06-29 22:47:20	Miles	Wait, no, 4
2014-06-29 22:47:23	Miles	Stupid time zones
2014-06-29 22:47:31	@Espyo	the bonus stream is just the finale?
2014-06-29 22:47:41	Miles	No?
2014-06-29 22:47:53	Miles	Someone's doing Majora's Mask right now
2014-06-29 22:48:52	@Espyo	but... after the finale, the stream ended, I thought they were pausing until tomorrow or something
2014-06-29 22:48:57	@Espyo	I remember 12 AM something...
2014-06-29 22:49:01	@Espyo	so, that was 4 hours ago?
2014-06-29 22:49:11	@Espyo	I thought it'd be 12+ hours after the end, not 1 or 2
2014-06-29 22:53:57	Miles	They said a bunch of times that they were starting the stream at noon MDT >_>
2014-06-29 22:54:05	Miles	Which is about 4 hours after the finale
2014-06-29 22:59:57	@Espyo	I was only around to hear it once, and I didn't catch the timezone
2014-06-29 23:00:16	@Espyo	I thought about asking on the twitch chat
2014-06-29 23:00:21	@Espyo	and then I laughed
2014-06-29 23:08:33	Miles	You know there's two chats right
2014-06-29 23:12:42	@Espyo	I do
2014-06-29 23:12:46	@Espyo	but the other one isn't much better

2014-06-29 23:16:42	@Espyo	aaaaand I cut off at a bad place
2014-06-29 23:16:56	@Espyo	I must've corrupted the sounds for stepping on dirt
2014-06-29 23:17:00	@Espyo	because all I hear is farts whenever I walk
2014-06-29 23:18:04	@Espyo	or maybe I corrupted the actual bird chirps
2014-06-29 23:25:12	@Espyo	where are the damned birds? on the first sound?
2014-06-29 23:30:40	@Espyo	something's not right...
2014-06-29 23:30:51	@Espyo	I cleared pretty much all of wScene_0, but I still hear loads of sounds, if not all
2014-06-29 23:32:12	@Espyo	err, scratch that
2014-06-29 23:33:05	@Espyo	I removed too much
2014-06-29 23:33:20	@Espyo	dammit
2014-06-29 23:33:27	@Espyo	how did you do it so easily?
2014-06-29 23:41:12	Miles	Probably by being in a different area
2014-06-29 23:41:56	@Espyo	hmm
2014-06-29 23:42:06	@Espyo	I was trying the AW
2014-06-29 23:43:42	@Espyo	according to the list of sounds, the WW sounds like a good idea

2014-06-30 00:19:24	Chillv	oh hi Espyo
2014-06-30 00:20:13	@Espyo	just a small note: in the future, try adding everything you need to the page, preview to make sure it's fine, and then submit
2014-06-30 00:20:17	@Espyo	instead of submitting in chunks
2014-06-30 00:20:24	@Espyo	Testyo here is a bot that reports the recent changes
2014-06-30 00:20:37	@Espyo	and your 6 last changes filled the IRC log quite a bit
2014-06-30 00:20:43	@Espyo	it's not a big thing, but in the future, it's good practice
2014-06-30 00:20:53	@Espyo	not just because of Testyo, but because of [[f:Special:RecentChanges]]

2014-06-30 00:22:37	@Espyo	sorry
2014-06-30 00:23:04	Chillv	but yeah, I rarely come here to the chat
2014-06-30 00:23:23	Chillv	I rarely come to Pikmin Fanon as it is

2014-07-01 19:32:28	@PikFan	.
2014-07-01 19:32:45	@PikFan	so it's supposed to hit 95F today
2014-07-01 19:32:46	Testyo	95 F = 35 °C / 308.15 K
2014-07-01 19:33:03	@PikFan	already 80F outside
2014-07-01 19:33:03	Testyo	80 F = 26.6667 °C / 299.817 K
2014-07-01 19:34:17	@J	it doesn't really go above 20C here
2014-07-01 19:34:17	Testyo	20 C = 68 °F / 293.15 K
2014-07-01 19:34:19	@J	also thunderstorms
2014-07-01 19:34:45	@PikFan	fun
2014-07-01 19:37:29	@Espyo	wow
2014-07-01 19:37:34	@Espyo	and wow
2014-07-01 19:37:44	@Espyo	here, it's sunny rain
2014-07-01 19:39:48	@PikFan	sunny... rain?
2014-07-01 19:39:58	@PikFan	oh, sunny/rain
2014-07-01 19:48:32	@Espyo	sunny rain
2014-07-01 19:48:34	@Espyo	it's sunny
2014-07-01 19:48:37	@Espyo	but it's raining
2014-07-01 19:48:38	@Espyo	well, was
2014-07-01 19:48:41	@Espyo	and it was only for a bit
2014-07-01 19:49:01	@PikFan	hm
2014-07-01 19:49:05	@PikFan	clear blue skies here
2014-07-01 19:49:20	@PikFan	going swimming later today
2014-07-01 19:50:16	@PikFan	...that's weird
2014-07-01 19:50:38	@PikFan	in Cookie Clicker my ACs have somehow made more cookies than Prisms
2014-07-01 19:50:56	@PikFan	yet Prisms are making nearly 10 times as many cookies each second
2014-07-01 19:51:35	@PikFan	I think the "x cookies made so far" is buggy
2014-07-01 20:10:52	@Espyo	yay swimming
2014-07-01 20:10:58	@Espyo	that really is weird
2014-07-01 20:11:39	@Espyo	the values look fixed to me
2014-07-01 20:12:36	@PikFan	I think they get messed up each time the page is closed or refreshed
2014-07-01 20:17:51	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-01 20:20:41	@Espyo	I found one NPC!P glitch difference: the cardboard box glitch has been fixed
2014-07-01 20:20:58	@PikFan	what glitch?
2014-07-01 20:21:19	@Espyo	at least it SEEMS like it has
2014-07-01 20:21:29	@Espyo	[[Glitches in Pikmin#Cardboard box cutscene softlock]]

2014-07-01 20:25:59	@J	http://i.imgur.com/GuNU0Fh.jpg
2014-07-01 20:26:03	@J	this doesn't look stable
2014-07-01 20:26:09	@J	I should've used bigger legs or something
2014-07-01 20:26:27	@J	I have enough fuel to take off again, I think, but I'll probably knock it over getting out
2014-07-01 20:26:38	@J	and taking off a rocket that's on its side is very explosiony
2014-07-01 20:27:36	@Espyo	it looks like a lanky alien
2014-07-01 20:28:21	@Espyo	hmm...
2014-07-01 20:28:30	@Espyo	PikFan: is there anything in Pikmin 3 that changes after the first playthrough?
2014-07-01 20:28:42	@Espyo	because, you know, when I get the game, I'll play through it, of course
2014-07-01 20:28:48	@Espyo	so I can point down whatever happens
2014-07-01 20:28:51	@J	http://i.imgur.com/ADw1POT.jpg
2014-07-01 20:28:56	@J	also, very low gravity
2014-07-01 20:29:02	@J	or giant astronaut
2014-07-01 20:29:03	@PikFan	by that, do you mean if anything changes when you start a second playthough
2014-07-01 20:30:22	@Espyo	exactly
2014-07-01 20:30:33	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-07-01 20:30:45	@Espyo	it really doesn't look like he fits the ship
2014-07-01 20:30:53	@Espyo	I blame GP Corp. for cutting down on production prices
2014-07-01 20:30:56	@Espyo	can't even afford room
2014-07-01 20:31:05	@PikFan	no, nothing changes
2014-07-01 20:31:59	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-01 20:32:11	@Espyo	I'm already planning for stuff that's going to be a pain to check at a later time
2014-07-01 20:32:20	@Espyo	like, the list of places a Red Bulborb appears in
2014-07-01 20:32:31	@Espyo	instead of checking everywhere in the game JUST to check the Bulborb's appearances
2014-07-01 20:32:39	@Espyo	I can point it down myself when I play for the 2nd time
2014-07-01 20:32:49	@Espyo	I already plan on doing several playthroughs (no deaths, low days, etc.)
2014-07-01 20:32:54	@Espyo	so I might as well point down info while I'm there
2014-07-01 20:34:10	@J	...so I just jumped 44m, somehow
2014-07-01 20:34:10	Testyo	44 m = 48.1184 yd / 144.355 ft / 2315.79 Olimar-heights / 7333.3 TRY-heights
2014-07-01 20:34:27	@J	in the game, I should add
2014-07-01 20:34:34	@J	44m high
2014-07-01 20:34:34	Testyo	44 m = 48.1184 yd / 144.355 ft / 2315.79 Olimar-heights / 7333.3 TRY-heights
2014-07-01 20:37:34	@Espyo	oh, I can remove that already
2014-07-01 20:37:41	@Espyo	the person I wanted to enrage is already enraged
2014-07-01 20:37:51	@Espyo	 44m
2014-07-01 20:37:52	Testyo	44 m = 48.1184 yd / 144.355 ft / 2315.79 Olimar-heights
2014-07-01 20:37:54	@Espyo	done
2014-07-01 20:38:08	@Espyo	well, low gravity does that
2014-07-01 20:45:45	@J	okay, I hope reaching the planet at 3000m/s won't cause any damage
2014-07-01 20:53:12	@J	...oh
2014-07-01 20:53:21	@J	I just realised a flaw in my plan
2014-07-01 20:53:39	@J	I didn't make the lander stage detachable from the command pod
2014-07-01 20:53:55	@J	and I'm going to land at a speed that will explode the engine
2014-07-01 20:54:35	@J	unless...I luckily land in the ocean
2014-07-01 20:56:15	@J	well, the experiments exploded
2014-07-01 20:59:11	@Espyo	send in more disposable Kerbels
2014-07-01 21:00:55	@J	the guy didn't even die
2014-07-01 21:01:06	@J	the command pod has higher crash resistance
2014-07-01 21:01:15	@Espyo	so he's just stranded in the ocean?
2014-07-01 21:01:28	@J	no, you can recover from anywhere on the home planet
2014-07-01 21:01:49	@J	he did try to eat part of the moon, though, so he may die yet
2014-07-01 21:01:59	@Espyo	moon rock poisoning... the fool
2014-07-01 21:02:05	@Espyo	wait... WHY did he try to do that, exactly?
2014-07-01 21:03:06	@J	there's this myth that the moon is made of ice cream or something
2014-07-01 21:03:11	@J	I told him to take a soil sample
2014-07-01 21:03:16	@J	and one thing led to another
2014-07-01 21:05:31	@Espyo	pfft how...
2014-07-01 21:05:35	@Espyo	I don't even think I want to know
2014-07-01 22:28:19	@PikFan	seems like wikia has taken a liking to us: http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin_Wiki
2014-07-01 22:28:27	@PikFan	look at their FA
2014-07-01 22:29:08	@PikFan	also they changed their cursor
2014-07-01 22:30:44	@PikFan	...wow, their Did you know is waaaaay out of date
2014-07-01 22:35:12	@Espyo	a liking to us?
2014-07-01 22:35:36	@PikFan	I was joking
2014-07-01 22:35:39	@Espyo	and yeah, that's outdated
2014-07-01 22:35:42	@Espyo	is it just me...
2014-07-01 22:35:49	@Espyo	or is almost literally everything about the front page broken
2014-07-01 22:36:00	@Espyo	and how did they change their cursor?
2014-07-01 22:36:10	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-07-01 22:36:35	@Espyo	no, that's not what I mena
2014-07-01 22:36:37	@Espyo	*mean
2014-07-01 22:36:39	@Espyo	not "how" how
2014-07-01 22:36:44	@Espyo	how as in where are you seeing a different cursor?
2014-07-01 22:36:51	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-01 22:37:08	@PikFan	it's a pixelated image of the onion from P3
2014-07-01 22:37:27	@PikFan	and I see it on every page in the Pikmin Wikia
2014-07-01 22:37:58	@PikFan	unless if the cursor is hovering over something clickable
2014-07-01 22:37:58	@Espyo	what
2014-07-01 22:38:06	@Espyo	please tell me you are shitting me
2014-07-01 22:38:15	@PikFan	no, I'm no
2014-07-01 22:38:23	@PikFan	*not
2014-07-01 22:39:49	@Espyo	all right, let me gather my bearings here
2014-07-01 22:39:57	@Espyo	a) they changed their sidebar to be a copy-paste of ours
2014-07-01 22:40:01	@Espyo	b) they broke their front page to bits
2014-07-01 22:40:04	@Espyo	c) they added a cursor
2014-07-01 22:40:24	@PikFan	wait, are you viewing it in Monobook
2014-07-01 22:41:05	@Espyo	default theme
2014-07-01 22:41:18	@PikFan	that's why you can't see it
2014-07-01 22:41:20	@Espyo	or maybe it's Monobook
2014-07-01 22:42:02	@PikFan	...ugh, it is broken
2014-07-01 22:42:09	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/failure.png whatever this is
2014-07-01 22:42:19	@PikFan	it, surprisingly, looks better in Oasis
2014-07-01 22:42:57	@Espyo	oh, I'm on Monobook
2014-07-01 22:43:04	@Espyo	I can't remember, did wikia's Monobook always look like Pikipedia?
2014-07-01 22:43:18	@PikFan	pretty sure
2014-07-01 22:43:35	@Espyo	ok, phew
2014-07-01 22:43:39	@Espyo	I thought they stole from us for a second
2014-07-01 22:43:43	@PikFan	I think we just adapted our sidebar after the move
2014-07-01 22:44:09	@Espyo	yes
2014-07-01 22:44:13	@Espyo	I think I remember now
2014-07-01 22:44:19	@Espyo	anyway... let's try the default theme
2014-07-01 22:44:35	@Espyo	%B%C4AAAAAHHH
2014-07-01 22:44:48	@Espyo	AAAAAHHH
2014-07-01 22:44:51	@Espyo	(that's what I meant)
2014-07-01 22:44:56	@Espyo	THEY ACTUALLY ADDED AN ACTUAL CURSOR
2014-07-01 22:44:58	@Espyo	THAT LOOKS LIKE ANUS
2014-07-01 22:45:32	@PikFan	lol
2014-07-01 22:45:40	@PikFan	yeah it's ugly
2014-07-01 22:45:55	@Espyo	not only that
2014-07-01 22:45:57	@Espyo	but it's pointless
2014-07-01 22:45:58	@Espyo	it's stupid
2014-07-01 22:46:04	@Espyo	it's something from 1998
2014-07-01 22:46:12	@Espyo	maybe you're too young
2014-07-01 22:46:19	@PikFan	they're just trying to pretty up the main page so it looks enticing
2014-07-01 22:46:27	@Espyo	but custom cursors were all the craze back in the early 2000s
2014-07-01 22:46:43	@Espyo	nowadays, if you have a custom cursor, you must be a lunatic
2014-07-01 22:46:49	@Espyo	"trying" is right
2014-07-01 22:47:10	@PikFan	and they ARE lunatics
2014-07-01 22:47:21	@PikFan	...?
2014-07-01 22:47:31	@PikFan	wait nevermind
2014-07-01 22:47:39	@PikFan	caps lock was broken for a sec
2014-07-01 22:47:59	@Espyo	well, one more point to add to the wikia text file
2014-07-01 22:48:46	@PikFan	I wish we could tell them what's wrong with them
2014-07-01 22:49:14	@PikFan	but them being stubborn won't listen and call us inferior
2014-07-01 22:53:01	@PikFan	NO
2014-07-01 22:53:02	@PikFan	.
2014-07-01 22:53:03	@PikFan	http://pikminfanon.wikia.com/wiki/User:Whiptoungbulborb8
2014-07-01 22:53:42	@Espyo	a user from our fano--
2014-07-01 22:53:47	@Espyo	look at all those "amazing" "achievements"
2014-07-01 22:53:58	@Espyo	PikFan: we also don't want to tell them what's wrong
2014-07-01 22:54:01	@Espyo	we don't want them to improve
2014-07-01 22:54:16	@PikFan	I've accepted that Pikmin Wikia is more popular than Pikipedia
2014-07-01 22:54:32	@PikFan	but Pikcanon-NOT shouldn't become more popular than Fanon
2014-07-01 22:54:37	@PikFan	because that will be bad
2014-07-01 22:55:15	@Espyo	yes...
2014-07-01 22:55:23	@Espyo	it has less activity, though
2014-07-01 22:55:40	@PikFan	right
2014-07-01 22:56:00	@PikFan	but if at least one of our wikis can stay above Wikia then that's a good thing
2014-07-01 22:58:11	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-07-01 22:58:35	@PikFan	14:53	Espyo	we don't want them to improve
2014-07-01 22:58:47	@PikFan	hm, true
2014-07-01 22:59:17	@PikFan	but we need to get them to leave wikia behind
2014-07-01 22:59:55	@PikFan	I think that they are a good community, they're just misguided
2014-07-01 23:00:02	@PikFan	and in the wrong place
2014-07-01 23:00:37	@Espyo	oh yes, the unguided fans
2014-07-01 23:00:46	@Espyo	the delusional wikia nutjobs, we don't want to help those know what's wrong
2014-07-01 23:01:04	@Espyo	problem is that if we try to bring the people a better thing, /we/ are the ones labeled as dicks
2014-07-01 23:01:50	@PikFan	aaaaaaaagh...
2014-07-01 23:02:11	@PikFan	I wish so badly that wikia was nonexistent 
2014-07-01 23:02:26	@Espyo	and now I went from being upset to being happy
2014-07-01 23:02:29	@Espyo	I just got a taunt kill on TF2
2014-07-01 23:02:37	@Espyo	it's a taunt that takes... 3+ seconds to perform
2014-07-01 23:02:40	@Espyo	and it can kill at the end
2014-07-01 23:02:43	@PikFan	nice
2014-07-01 23:02:43	@Espyo	and I laughed really hard
2014-07-01 23:02:49	@Espyo	aaah...
2014-07-01 23:02:59	@Espyo	anyway, we still have loads of points to improve on Pikipedia
2014-07-01 23:03:14	@Espyo	let's just hope that when we improve AND we gather Pikmin 3 info, that we'll finally be recognized and accepted as the best
2014-07-01 23:05:06	@PikFan	ooh, I just remembered

2014-07-01 23:05:36	@PikFan	the one year anniversary of P3's release in Japan is coming up
2014-07-01 23:07:21	@PikFan	Espyo, are you getting P3 anytime soon?
2014-07-01 23:07:31	@Espyo	hopefully
2014-07-01 23:07:39	@Espyo	but not any sooner than 2 months, I don't think
2014-07-01 23:07:44	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-01 23:08:20	@PikFan	I need to make area articles for P3
2014-07-01 23:08:33	@PikFan	problem is I'm bad at describing the layout at stuff
2014-07-01 23:08:50	@PikFan	*layout of stuff
2014-07-01 23:11:36	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-01 23:11:44	@Espyo	base yourself on the existing P and P2 articles
2014-07-01 23:11:54	@Espyo	or maybe work on treasures, forget the areas for now
2014-07-01 23:18:44	@PikFan	back later, swimming
2014-07-01 23:23:16	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-01 23:35:40	@Espyo	I still have the tab open
2014-07-01 23:35:57	@Espyo	why is there a "死ぬ!" option on their "What do you hope to see in Pikmin 3 DLC?" poll
2014-07-01 23:43:33	@Espyo	did I go back in time?
2014-07-01 23:43:36	@Espyo	first wikia using a cursor
2014-07-01 23:43:49	@Espyo	now a site my mum is navigating on has everything inside frames
2014-07-01 23:43:53	@Espyo	and the url of the site never changes

2014-07-03 18:16:04	@Espyo	even if you just want to fix typos, any help is appreciated
2014-07-03 18:16:27	Pikmaniac	Wow.
2014-07-03 18:16:48	Pikmaniac	I've noticed the wiki is really lacking in the Pikmin 3 department though.
2014-07-03 18:16:53	@Espyo	it is...
2014-07-03 18:16:58	@Espyo	it's by far, our biggest problem
2014-07-03 18:17:04	@Espyo	everything else is mostly rich in info
2014-07-03 18:17:15	@Espyo	our most active editors don't have Pikmin 3
2014-07-03 18:17:18	@Espyo	so they can't add info yet
2014-07-03 18:17:34	Pikmaniac	I was confused because there are two wikis: Pikmin Wiki and Pikipedia so I don't know which one I should join.
2014-07-03 18:17:47	@Espyo	well, it's a long story
2014-07-03 18:17:53	@Espyo	[[Pikipedia:About]]
2014-07-03 18:17:53	Testyo	"Pikipedia:About" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:About
2014-07-03 18:17:58	@Espyo	you can find more on that link
2014-07-03 18:18:01	@Espyo	but the short version is
2014-07-03 18:18:13	@Espyo	some years ago, the Pikmin wiki, hosted at wikia.com was created
2014-07-03 18:18:21	@Espyo	it slowly grew into a decent wiki
2014-07-03 18:18:39	@Espyo	at one point, wikia, the host behind it all, decided to change the layout
2014-07-03 18:18:50	@Espyo	almost everybody in almost all wikis hosted at that website opposed
2014-07-03 18:19:01	@Espyo	because the new layout was both ugly and inconvenient
2014-07-03 18:19:09	@Espyo	but the admins at wikia did not care
2014-07-03 18:19:16	@Espyo	with that new layout came new problems
2014-07-03 18:19:24	@Espyo	layout problems, usability problems, and even trust issues
2014-07-03 18:19:41	@Espyo	after all, if the folks behind wikia will not listen to the opinions of their users, how trustworthy can they be?
2014-07-03 18:19:46	Pikmaniac	Wow.
2014-07-03 18:19:51	@Espyo	as such, a LOT of wikis that used to be hosted at that website moved to their own domains
2014-07-03 18:20:01	@Espyo	Pikipedia's sister wiki, Pikmin fanon was the first to move
2014-07-03 18:20:06	@Espyo	Pikipedia followed after
2014-07-03 18:20:19	@Espyo	we now belong to a group known as NIWA, which hosts a lot of Nintendo wikis
2014-07-03 18:20:28	@Espyo	and unlike wikia, this host is a normal wiki, a perfectly good one
2014-07-03 18:20:45	@Espyo	however, the time we spent on wikia did have an effect: it made the wikia link the most popular one on google searches
2014-07-03 18:21:00	Pikmaniac	I have an account on Wikia and I'm an admin on one wikis over there and I too miss Monaco.
2014-07-03 18:21:03	@Espyo	so whenever people wanted a wiki about Pikmin, they would search something along the lines of "pikmin wiki", and find the old wikia in first place
2014-07-03 18:21:16	@Espyo	yes, I have a wikia there as well
2014-07-03 18:21:22	@Espyo	except I too moved out just some weeks ago
2014-07-03 18:21:26	@Espyo	I couldn't stand it any more
2014-07-03 18:21:41	@Espyo	anyway, when Pikmin 3 started being mentioned, fans who wanted to help went there, without realizing that Pikipedia moved
2014-07-03 18:21:47	@Espyo	eventually, the abandoned wiki grew again...
2014-07-03 18:21:56	@Espyo	and now it's filled with more amateur editors
2014-07-03 18:22:08	@Espyo	it's already a poor website to begin with (and only got a LOT worse over the years)
2014-07-03 18:22:16	Pikmaniac	It has a great Google Rank though.
2014-07-03 18:22:18	@Espyo	and the users that edit there aren't the best ones
2014-07-03 18:22:26	@Espyo	yes, unfortunately
2014-07-03 18:22:32	@Espyo	that's why people sometimes don't know of the existence of Pikipedia
2014-07-03 18:22:48	@Espyo	although at Pikipedia, we are missing some Pikmin 3 info, our editors are a lot more dedicated, and the information is more important
2014-07-03 18:23:05	@Espyo	at wikia, the site eventually degraded to an even worse layout, with more ads and such
2014-07-03 18:23:14	Pikmaniac	I would help with Pikmin 3 except I also don't own it yet.
2014-07-03 18:23:16	@Espyo	last time I checked wikia, all the wikis had very poor pages
2014-07-03 18:23:26	@Espyo	so yeah, long story short
2014-07-03 18:23:34	@Espyo	Pikmin wiki SHOULD have been abandoned
2014-07-03 18:23:41	Pikmaniac	I'm currently playing Pikmin 2 though, not sure how much help that would be though.
2014-07-03 18:23:41	@Espyo	but unfortunately it came back, weaker as it may be
2014-07-03 18:23:49	@Espyo	hmm...
2014-07-03 18:23:54	@Espyo	do you have the US version?
2014-07-03 18:23:56	Pikmaniac	*that would be.
2014-07-03 18:23:57	Pikmaniac	Yes.
2014-07-03 18:24:07	@Espyo	a few of our US-only treasures are slightly lacking in info
2014-07-03 18:24:16	@Espyo	off the top of my head: [[Healing Cask]]
2014-07-03 18:24:16	Testyo	"Healing_Cask" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Healing_Cask
2014-07-03 18:24:24	@Espyo	(maybe don't click it if you haven't accessed the third area yet)
2014-07-03 18:24:35	Pikmaniac	Oh, I beat the game.
2014-07-03 18:24:41	@Espyo	oh, good
2014-07-03 18:24:50	Pikmaniac	I did a second file and I already beat it yesterday.
2014-07-03 18:24:51	@Espyo	err, looking back at that article, it's actually decent enough
2014-07-03 18:25:02	Pikmaniac	I tried doing it without killing any Pikmin.
2014-07-03 18:25:06	@Espyo	I guess the only problem with the Healing Cask's article is the crappy image
2014-07-03 18:25:10	@Espyo	any luck?
2014-07-03 18:25:16	Pikmaniac	Yep.
2014-07-03 18:25:20	@Espyo	nice
2014-07-03 18:25:27	@Espyo	that's what I plan on doing when I get Pikmin 3 as well
2014-07-03 18:25:31	@Espyo	first, play relaxed
2014-07-03 18:25:34	@Espyo	then, try playing without deaths
2014-07-03 18:25:41	Pikmaniac	Got through almost every cave without killing Pikmin (and no, I'm not trying to brag, lol).
2014-07-03 18:25:43	@Espyo	I'm hoping on getting Pikmin 3 some time soon...
2014-07-03 18:25:50	@Espyo	almost?
2014-07-03 18:25:55	Pikmaniac	The problem is I got a glitch where apparently 10 of my Pikmin died but that's not true!
2014-07-03 18:26:01	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-07-03 18:26:04	@Espyo	a glitch, huh
2014-07-03 18:26:08	Pikmaniac	It's weird.
2014-07-03 18:26:12	@Espyo	[[Glitches in Pikmin 2#Crushing glitch]] this?
2014-07-03 18:26:13	Testyo	"Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Crushing_glitch" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Crushing_glitch
2014-07-03 18:26:25	Pikmaniac	Not quite.
2014-07-03 18:26:35	Pikmaniac	I went into the cave with 100 Pikmin.
2014-07-03 18:26:38	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-03 18:26:41	Pikmaniac	I left the cave with 100 Pikmin.
2014-07-03 18:26:50	Pikmaniac	But it told me that apparently 10 died.
2014-07-03 18:27:07	Pikmaniac	I think it might be the Cave death glitch.
2014-07-03 18:27:14	@Espyo	ah yes
2014-07-03 18:27:18	@Espyo	from the looks of it, that's what it is
2014-07-03 18:27:20	Pikmaniac	*Cave death count glitch.
2014-07-03 18:27:25	@Espyo	amazing, that glitch is actually a bit hard to pull off
2014-07-03 18:27:29	@Espyo	you got really unlucky, then...
2014-07-03 18:27:31	Pikmaniac	Yeah, it stinks.
2014-07-03 18:27:44	Pikmaniac	But oh well.
2014-07-03 18:27:46	@Espyo	well, you don't get any special in-game reward for completing the game with no deaths
2014-07-03 18:27:52	@Espyo	so you're not missing on anything
2014-07-03 18:28:04	@Espyo	and for all intents and purposes, for your sake, you completed it without killing Pikmin
2014-07-03 18:28:09	@Espyo	don't let a silly glitch get you down
2014-07-03 18:28:19	Pikmaniac	I mean, I guess.
2014-07-03 18:28:27	Pikmaniac	But yeah.
2014-07-03 18:29:03	@Espyo	oh, I got something that needs to be done, regarding Pikmin 2!
2014-07-03 18:29:08	Pikmaniac	I'm surprised the Shaggy Long Legs article has no images even though I found one on the wiki.
2014-07-03 18:29:15	Pikmaniac	Cool, what is it?
2014-07-03 18:29:20	@Espyo	I planned on doing this after I added Pikmin 3 info, but if it can be done before, all the better
2014-07-03 18:29:26	@Espyo	and really? somebody must've forgotten to add it
2014-07-03 18:29:34	Pikmaniac	Yep.
2014-07-03 18:29:40	@Espyo	the cave articles all contain guides on how to complete them
2014-07-03 18:29:45	@Espyo	but these guides are pretty outdated
2014-07-03 18:29:49	Pikmaniac	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin3_Emo-Long-Legs.png
2014-07-03 18:29:52	@Espyo	at best, they don't follow our most recent guidelines
2014-07-03 18:29:58	@Espyo	at worst, they are filled with typos
2014-07-03 18:30:14	@Espyo	if you want to help, and have some time to spare, you could go through the articles and improve on them
2014-07-03 18:30:19	@Espyo	heh, that file name
2014-07-03 18:30:23	Pikmaniac	Cool, I'll see what I can do.
2014-07-03 18:30:36	Pikmaniac	And yeah, the image name is pretty funny.
2014-07-03 18:30:41	@Espyo	another smaller thing is the list of objects
2014-07-03 18:30:46	Pikmaniac	But also unprofessional from a wiki standpoint.
2014-07-03 18:30:47	@Espyo	every cave article's sublevel has a list of levels
2014-07-03 18:30:50	@Espyo	*a list of objects
2014-07-03 18:30:59	@Espyo	quite true, somebody will rename it in the future, though
2014-07-03 18:31:08	@Espyo	plus, it's just backend, the name never appears for the final article reader
2014-07-03 18:31:20	@Espyo	I got the list of objects from the files inside Pikmin 2
2014-07-03 18:31:22	@Espyo	but the thing is...
2014-07-03 18:31:26	Pikmaniac	Yeah, but it does appear during editing.
2014-07-03 18:31:30	@Espyo	the files make NO sense
2014-07-03 18:31:32	@Espyo	hmm, that's true, it does
2014-07-03 18:31:45	Pikmaniac	Mm hmm.
2014-07-03 18:31:48	@Espyo	Testyo: memo J rename http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin3_Emo-Long-Legs.png when you can, to Shaggy Long Legs
2014-07-03 18:31:48	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for J saying: rename http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin3_Emo-Long-Legs.png when you can, to Shaggy Long Legs.
2014-07-03 18:31:53	@Espyo	so anyway...
2014-07-03 18:31:59	@Espyo	the object list might have some wrong numbers
2014-07-03 18:32:09	@Espyo	like saying there are 10 eggs in a sublevel when there's actually only one
2014-07-03 18:32:16	@Espyo	having somebody to double check these numbers would be great
2014-07-03 18:32:30	Pikmaniac	Awesome.
2014-07-03 18:32:36	@Espyo	I completed Pikmin 2 over 5 times already, and having to do it once more just to check kind of drains my time...
2014-07-03 18:32:45	@Espyo	I mainly focus on other articles now
2014-07-03 18:32:50	@Espyo	as well as the fangame engine
2014-07-03 18:33:02	@Espyo	so I don't really have time to go back and take care of double checking object numbers
2014-07-03 18:33:10	Pikmaniac	That's understandable.
2014-07-03 18:33:17	@Espyo	plus it looks like some numbers are only true when on a certain cave configuration, and...
2014-07-03 18:33:20	@Espyo	gah, it's just a huge mess
2014-07-03 18:33:31	@Espyo	either there's some secret to it, or the Pikmin 2 developers are crazy
2014-07-03 18:33:50	Pikmaniac	Definitely.
2014-07-03 18:33:57	Pikmaniac	Well, I'll see what I can do.
2014-07-03 18:34:03	@Espyo	if you decide to start a new playthrough (maybe to try to actually get a 0-death run), and take care of the articles, let me know
2014-07-03 18:34:08	Pikmaniac	And hopefully my contributions help Pikipedia a lot.
2014-07-03 18:34:11	@Espyo	so I can take some hours to try to definitely understand the numbers
2014-07-03 18:34:18	@Espyo	even if they're small, they do help, trust me
2014-07-03 18:34:27	@Espyo	with over 600 articles, it's normal that even a slight typo can escape here and there
2014-07-03 18:34:37	@Espyo	so even fixing a typo is appreciated
2014-07-03 18:34:45	Pikmaniac	Awesome.
2014-07-03 18:34:55	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-03 18:34:55	Pikmaniac	Well, I suppose I should create my account now.
2014-07-03 18:35:01	@Espyo	feel free to create a user page, afterwards
2014-07-03 18:35:11	@Espyo	you can even write your Pikmin 2 records, some users do that
2014-07-03 18:35:13	Pikmaniac	Interesting.
2014-07-03 18:35:29	Pikmaniac	One thing that bothers me about reading articles is the background image.
2014-07-03 18:35:40	@Espyo	no need to worry
2014-07-03 18:35:45	@Espyo	we've been meaning to change it for ages
2014-07-03 18:35:50	Pikmaniac	Sometimes it strains my eyes reading a block of text with the Purple Pikmin there.
2014-07-03 18:35:58	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-07-03 18:36:03	@Espyo	plus, it's not a very good image to begin with
2014-07-03 18:36:10	@Espyo	we got /very/ close to changing the background image
2014-07-03 18:36:19	@Espyo	but we couldn't decide between a couple of tones of the texture, imagine that
2014-07-03 18:36:22	@Espyo	so eventually we forgot
2014-07-03 18:36:29	Pikmaniac	Wow.
2014-07-03 18:36:31	@Espyo	there are other priorities, you see
2014-07-03 18:36:38	Pikmaniac	Are you an admin here?
2014-07-03 18:36:55	@Espyo	almost, I'm a patroller
2014-07-03 18:37:02	@Espyo	that just means I can mark an edit as "patrolled"
2014-07-03 18:37:09	@Espyo	I can also block users, specially spammers
2014-07-03 18:37:20	Pikmaniac	Sounds good.
2014-07-03 18:37:25	@Espyo	uh, unless I got the wrong image file, these are the backgrounds we discussed at some point https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/PBG2.png
2014-07-03 18:37:33	Pikmaniac	Are any of the other users in this chat admins?
2014-07-03 18:37:36	@Espyo	I think we were going to go with... #3? can't remember
2014-07-03 18:37:39	@Espyo	J is an admin, yes
2014-07-03 18:37:49	Pikmaniac	Cool.
2014-07-03 18:37:53	@Espyo	the other admins don't usually come on the chat, but they're always accessible from their talk pages
2014-07-03 18:38:07	Pikmaniac	Oh, okay.
2014-07-03 18:39:22	Pikmaniac	Have you ever considered using Japanese names on articles? Pikmin is a Japanese-created franchise, after all.
2014-07-03 18:40:30	Pikmaniac	Well, I see a few.
2014-07-03 18:40:42	@Espyo	yeah, like Ujadani
2014-07-03 18:41:03	@Espyo	the wiki is in English, so almost all readers will be familiar with the Japanese versions of the names
2014-07-03 18:41:13	@Espyo	sorry, *with the English versions of the names
2014-07-03 18:41:49	Pikmaniac	So you don't use like an "In other languages" section?
2014-07-03 18:41:55	@Espyo	oh, that
2014-07-03 18:41:59	@Espyo	I thought you meant the titles
2014-07-03 18:42:05	@Espyo	...looking back, I have no idea why I thought that
2014-07-03 18:42:09	@Espyo	because you clearly didn't say "titles"
2014-07-03 18:42:10	@Espyo	my bad
2014-07-03 18:42:14	@Espyo	yeah, some articles do have it
2014-07-03 18:42:24	@Espyo	we want to have that for all articles
2014-07-03 18:42:26	@Espyo	and all official languages
2014-07-03 18:42:50	@Espyo	but there aren't enough editors who both own the games in the other regions and can provide a decent English name translation
2014-07-03 18:43:32	Pikmaniac	Could we do it for Ujadani? The article details where it gets it name from but it doesn't have the "In other languages" section with its name in katakana.
2014-07-03 18:43:54	@Espyo	of course
2014-07-03 18:43:57	@Espyo	if you know the name, please add it
2014-07-03 18:44:21	Pikmaniac	If you mean the characters, yeah, I can get the katakana for Ujadani.
2014-07-03 18:44:47	Pikmaniac	In fact, I can probably get it for any article.
2014-07-03 18:44:50	@Espyo	but do you mean by the likes of Google Translate?
2014-07-03 18:45:01	@Espyo	because we'd rather have no translation than a machine translation
2014-07-03 18:45:03	Pikmaniac	No, I use something else.
2014-07-03 18:45:13	Pikmaniac	Wait, you want translations?
2014-07-03 18:45:20	@Espyo	err, not quite what I meant
2014-07-03 18:45:22	@Espyo	wrong wording
2014-07-03 18:45:35	@Espyo	you'll be using some program to get the katakana characters, right?
2014-07-03 18:45:44	Pikmaniac	Pretty much.

2014-07-03 18:45:58	Pikmaniac	I double check it.
2014-07-03 18:46:01	Pikmaniac	*it'll
2014-07-03 18:46:11	@Espyo	in that case, sure
2014-07-03 18:46:20	Pikmaniac	Cool.
2014-07-03 18:46:27	@Espyo	it's just that we'd rather have no info instead of inaccurate info
2014-07-03 18:46:35	@Espyo	but if you can confirm that it's accurate, great, please add it in!
2014-07-03 18:46:53	Pikmaniac	Oh believe it, it'll be very accurate.
2014-07-03 18:47:05	Pikmaniac	*believe me,
2014-07-03 18:47:06	@Espyo	great

2014-07-03 18:47:49	@Espyo	what the...
2014-07-03 18:48:13	Pikmaniac	I wonder if I can find better quality.
2014-07-03 18:48:18	@Espyo	who is that SacredyinZekrom and why did they upload a "higher quality" version?
2014-07-03 18:48:22	@Espyo	they just grabbed the original and upscaled it
2014-07-03 18:48:40	@Espyo	thanks for letting me know, I reverted it
2014-07-03 18:48:41	Pikmaniac	Not sure, I thought you guys knew that.
2014-07-03 18:49:39	Pikmaniac	*knew about that.
2014-07-03 18:49:45	Pikmaniac	But you're welcome, Espyo.
2014-07-03 18:49:53	@Espyo	this edit happened in 2013...
2014-07-03 18:50:01	@Espyo	might have been during a time where we were too overwhelmed with edits to check
2014-07-03 18:50:04	@Espyo	not sure
2014-07-03 18:50:18	@Espyo	but normally we check the recent changes, so silly things like this don't pass by
2014-07-03 18:50:29	@Espyo	quality control... that's another thing severely lacking on wikia
2014-07-03 18:50:31	Pikmaniac	Oh, okay.
2014-07-03 18:50:33	@Espyo	ugh, I don't even want to talk about that website
2014-07-03 18:51:03	Pikmaniac	Hmmm.

2014-07-03 18:51:39	Pikmaniac	Does the Titan Dweevil have an e-card?
2014-07-03 18:54:30	@Espyo	not sure if it does
2014-07-03 18:56:26	Pikmaniac	Got to keep searching.
2014-07-03 18:59:10	Pikmaniac	Well, I think I just deduced the Japanese name for the Titan Dweevil.
2014-07-03 18:59:31	Pikmaniac	And it's very different from a name like "Titan Dweevil".
2014-07-03 19:01:49	@Espyo	I think I read that before
2014-07-03 19:02:32	Pikmaniac	Did you read the katakana or a translation?
2014-07-03 19:03:35	@Espyo	neither, I think I actually read a loose tidbit somewhere on some website
2014-07-03 19:03:42	@Espyo	that explained the Titan Dweevil's name
2014-07-03 19:03:46	@Espyo	but if I did, it was ages ago
2014-07-03 19:03:53	@Espyo	I can always go check the in-game files
2014-07-03 19:04:10	@Espyo	I have an ISO of the Japanese version, so I can check the strings and names
2014-07-03 19:04:19	Pikmaniac	Cool.
2014-07-03 19:06:06	Pikmaniac	Lol, I just noticed somebody is already registered with "Pikmaniac".
2014-07-03 19:06:15	@Espyo	really?
2014-07-03 19:06:17	@Espyo	that sucks...
2014-07-03 19:06:42	Pikmaniac	Doesn't matter to me.
2014-07-03 19:06:47	Pikmaniac	I'll just pick a new one.
2014-07-03 19:08:12	@J	[18:35:29] Pikmaniac One thing that bothers me about reading articles is the background image.
2014-07-03 19:08:12	@J	[18:35:40] @Espyo no need to worry
2014-07-03 19:08:12	@J	[18:35:45] @Espyo we've been meaning to change it for ages
2014-07-03 19:08:15	@J	oh yeah, that thing
2014-07-03 19:08:23	@J	you should remind me when I forget things
2014-07-03 19:08:32	@J	[18:36:38] Pikmaniac Are you an admin here?
2014-07-03 19:08:32	@J	[18:36:55] @Espyo almost, I'm a patroller
2014-07-03 19:08:41	@Espyo	I was thinking of making the change when we get Pikmin 3 info
2014-07-03 19:08:49	@J	yeah, we should probably make you admin at some point, especially given my non-editingness of late
2014-07-03 19:08:55	@Espyo	you know, as a way to separate the "old, lacking Pikipedia" with the "new, Pikmin 3 rich Pikipedia"
2014-07-03 19:09:02	@J	hmm
2014-07-03 19:09:14	@J	not sure I see the point
2014-07-03 19:09:15	@Espyo	we have to talk to... Prez about it, right?
2014-07-03 19:09:26	@J	about which/
2014-07-03 19:09:26	@J	*?
2014-07-03 19:09:28	@Espyo	all right, right now, Pikipedia is only behind wikia in content because of the Pikmin 3 things
2014-07-03 19:09:38	@Espyo	when we get Pikmin 3 info
2014-07-03 19:09:43	@Espyo	it's going to be a turning point in Pikipedia history
2014-07-03 19:09:49	@Espyo	not just in comparison to wikia, but in general
2014-07-03 19:09:57	@Espyo	we'll go from incomplete, to complete (kinda)
2014-07-03 19:10:05	@Espyo	so we might as well add the new background then
2014-07-03 19:10:09	@Espyo	to signal a fresh new milestone
2014-07-03 19:10:42	@Espyo	hey, speaking of admin, I think there are some pages that need to be deleted
2014-07-03 19:10:43	@J	sure, why not
2014-07-03 19:10:49	@J	makes my laziness easier
2014-07-03 19:12:01	@J	what did you say we had to talk to Prez about/
2014-07-03 19:12:02	@J	*?
2014-07-03 19:13:42	@Espyo	about admining
2014-07-03 19:14:22	@J	not really, why would we?
2014-07-03 19:14:39	@Espyo	admins can't make other people admins
2014-07-03 19:14:42	@Espyo	last I checked, at least

2014-07-05 18:30:00	@Espyo	 /what/
2014-07-05 18:44:53	@Espyo	tiny fact of the day: after Pikmin 2's ending cutscene, you get the high scores
2014-07-05 18:45:00	@Espyo	which show the top 3 scores on each category
2014-07-05 18:45:16	@Espyo	the game files for this screen have images called "best5_something.bti"
2014-07-05 19:35:35	@Espyo	uh...
2014-07-05 19:35:38	@Espyo	do you remember, in ANY way
2014-07-05 19:35:41	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 giving a game over?
2014-07-05 20:23:29	@J	  depends what you mean, I guess
2014-07-05 20:23:39	@J	nearest thing is both captains dying, or losing all Pikmin
2014-07-05 20:23:44	@J	...random spaces there
2014-07-05 20:23:53	@Espyo	actual "game over"
2014-07-05 20:24:12	@Espyo	because there's a menu file called "gameover"
2014-07-05 20:24:26	@Espyo	and it has a texture inside for "GAME OVER", in a font like the one you see when you enter an area
2014-07-05 20:24:34	@Espyo	so it goes in with the "Olimar is down!" message and the like
2014-07-05 20:24:43	@Espyo	I tried replacing the file with the one for "Olimar is down!"
2014-07-05 20:24:45	@Espyo	but the game just froze
2014-07-05 20:25:08	@Espyo	what's even weirder is that the ones for Olimar, Louie and the President being down ALSO contain this "GAME OVER" texture

2014-07-06 13:09:19	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJRVCKu9PU I'm surprised at how well the game took it
2014-07-06 13:29:02	Miles	Other places take it a lot better than that
2014-07-06 13:29:47	Miles	Sometimes problems with loading/opening rooms though
2014-07-06 13:30:10	Miles	And a lot of stuff only designed for a single player
2014-07-06 13:30:31	@Espyo	but you can just move from room to room, for the most part?
2014-07-06 13:30:50	Miles	If it doesn't crash on you when you try to do so, yes
2014-07-06 13:30:54	@Espyo	amazing
2014-07-06 13:31:13	@Espyo	what I REALLY like is how it just split between regular play and the opening cutscene
2014-07-06 13:31:20	@Espyo	that just goes beyond madness
2014-07-06 14:16:26	@J	why the huge letterboxing?

2014-07-06 15:19:47	Miles	It's split-screen multiplayer
2014-07-06 15:27:34	@J	yeah, I know
2014-07-06 15:27:42	@J	but there are huge letterboxes on both screen
2014-07-06 15:27:42	@J	s
2014-07-06 15:27:50	@J	I don't remember that from playing it
2014-07-06 15:41:54	Miles	Because the cutscene is completely screwing it up
2014-07-06 15:57:12	@J	I see - yeah, I was wondering if it was the cutscene, or if it happened without cutscenes too
2014-07-06 15:57:20	@J	but maybe every SP map starts with a cutscene?

2014-07-07 15:02:07	@Espyo	yeah, it's really mind-boggling
2014-07-07 15:02:09	@PikFan	you've been busy
2014-07-07 15:02:15	@Espyo	at least, for a change, it's not something negative towards Pikipedia

2014-07-07 15:02:43	@Espyo	and yeah, I've been working on quite a few articles
2014-07-07 15:02:44	@PikFan	yeah, slightly confused
2014-07-07 15:02:47	@Espyo	still have more planned

2014-07-07 15:05:09	@Espyo	good quesiton
2014-07-07 15:05:11	@Espyo	*question
2014-07-07 15:05:14	@Espyo	I guess we never thought about them
2014-07-07 15:05:21	@Espyo	but now that we realized they're missing
2014-07-07 15:05:24	@Espyo	it's incredibly obvious

2014-07-07 15:05:46	Testyo	I will now stop fetching the recent changes from the wikis.
2014-07-07 15:05:56	@Espyo	I'll be updating some pages for the next few minutes, so I'll make Testyo not spam
2014-07-07 15:08:05	@PikFan	otoh wikia has very little info (if none) on gameplay stuff
2014-07-07 15:08:30	@Espyo	yeah

2014-07-07 15:08:48	@Espyo	and only because we created it before leaving

2014-07-07 15:11:26	@Espyo	oh, good
2014-07-07 15:11:36	@Espyo	Wii TP makes you waggle the Wii Remote to attack
2014-07-07 15:11:46	@Espyo	and when you go from SS to TP and vice-versa, it really throws you off
2014-07-07 15:11:51	@Espyo	in one, you carefully aim where to attack
2014-07-07 15:11:56	@Espyo	in the other, you flail like a mad man
2014-07-07 15:12:00	@PikFan	I'd be lost if I had to play Wii TP
2014-07-07 15:12:15	@PikFan	flail like Zant
2014-07-07 15:12:19	@Espyo	heh, yeah

2014-07-08 01:01:48	@PikFan	looks like P1 to me...
2014-07-08 01:02:05	@PikFan	in P1 "day" isn't capitalized, but in P2 it is
2014-07-08 01:04:59	@Espyo	hmm, you're right
2014-07-08 01:05:04	@Espyo	uh, might've been P1, actually
2014-07-08 01:05:05	@Espyo	oops
2014-07-08 01:05:08	@Espyo	care to fix it?
2014-07-08 01:05:18	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-08 01:05:57	@PikFan	...but newtest is in P2, so how is it day, not Day
2014-07-08 01:07:07	@Espyo	yeah, I took almost all of the overworld-exclusive things in newtest
2014-07-08 01:07:11	@Espyo	except day, that was in P1
2014-07-08 01:07:16	@Espyo	I initially was going to start with P1
2014-07-08 01:07:23	@Espyo	but decided to move to P2 right away because I can get every one there
2014-07-08 01:07:51	@PikFan	so you didn't take day in newtest?
2014-07-08 01:07:58	@Espyo	nope, P1
2014-07-08 01:08:02	@Espyo	TFN
2014-07-08 01:08:07	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-08 01:08:19	@PikFan	well, we'd better change that, then
2014-07-08 01:10:08	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-08 01:17:13	@Espyo	ok, so here's my Pikmin 3 plan
2014-07-08 01:17:17	@Espyo	first playthrough, play normally
2014-07-08 01:17:35	@Espyo	second playthrough, play with no deaths and point down the location of every enemy, plant, etc.
2014-07-08 01:17:47	@Espyo	third playthrough, hook the capture device and take screenshots of everything I ca
2014-07-08 01:17:48	@Espyo	*can
2014-07-08 01:18:06	@PikFan	uh
2014-07-08 01:18:19	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-07-08 01:18:19	@PikFan	you can't lock on to plants
2014-07-08 01:18:26	@PikFan	they
2014-07-08 01:18:31	@Espyo	but I can still point down their locations, right?
2014-07-08 01:18:33	@PikFan	're just there
2014-07-08 01:18:38	@Espyo	unless you mean that in the sense that they don't matter for articles
2014-07-08 01:18:41	@PikFan	right, but they're not named
2014-07-08 01:18:55	@Espyo	nor are they important?
2014-07-08 01:19:11	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-08 01:20:40	@Espyo	we have info on the plants on Pikipedia because they're a part of the Piklopedia
2014-07-08 01:20:49	@Espyo	because otherwise, we wouldn't
2014-07-08 01:20:53	@Espyo	I mean, we don't have info on P1 plants
2014-07-08 01:21:15	@Espyo	and if in P3, they're just as useless as in P1, then forget it
2014-07-08 01:21:21	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-08 01:21:27	@PikFan	just as useless as in P1
2014-07-08 01:21:39	@PikFan	only plant worth noting is the Burgeoning Spiderwort
2014-07-08 01:21:40	@Espyo	all right, then
2014-07-08 01:21:42	@Espyo	right
2014-07-08 01:21:47	@Espyo	but that one's kind of special
2014-07-08 01:21:53	@Espyo	so enemies, obstacles, hazards...
2014-07-08 01:22:01	@Espyo	anything that appears in random places?
2014-07-08 01:22:07	@Espyo	if so, the more places I can register, the better
2014-07-08 01:22:17	@PikFan	can you be a bit more specific?
2014-07-08 01:22:40	@PikFan	not quite sure what you mean
2014-07-08 01:23:01	@PikFan	OH
2014-07-08 01:23:07	@PikFan	Data Files!
2014-07-08 01:23:16	@PikFan	those are really important
2014-07-08 01:23:33	@PikFan	they're like golden little files that are everywhere
2014-07-08 01:23:55	@PikFan	they give you hints and tips about stuff
2014-07-08 01:24:19	@Espyo	precisely, I don't know if there's anything that appears in random places
2014-07-08 01:24:21	@Espyo	like...
2014-07-08 01:24:22	@Espyo	uh...
2014-07-08 01:24:29	@Espyo	dirt mounds, let's say
2014-07-08 01:24:35	@Espyo	suppose they appear in pre-determined spots along the map
2014-07-08 01:24:41	@Espyo	but appear only one per map
2014-07-08 01:24:44	@Espyo	randomly picked position
2014-07-08 01:24:49	@PikFan	no
2014-07-08 01:24:51	@Espyo	that way, I can point down ALL positions that I find
2014-07-08 01:24:55	@Espyo	so that we can have a list
2014-07-08 01:25:00	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-07-08 01:25:11	@PikFan	Swarming Sheargrubs /might/ be randomly placed
2014-07-08 01:25:12	@Espyo	without anybody having to go and search for all spots /specifically/
2014-07-08 01:25:25	@PikFan	but they move
2014-07-08 01:25:33	@PikFan	their movement is also random
2014-07-08 01:25:54	@Espyo	all right, I'll point it down
2014-07-08 01:25:57	@Espyo	what about the outcome of eggs?
2014-07-08 01:26:06	@PikFan	they stay in the same spots
2014-07-08 01:26:13	@PikFan	also, no eggs fall from the sky
2014-07-08 01:26:37	@Espyo	and that gives me an idea for a new article: Random
2014-07-08 01:26:43	@Espyo	a list of things that have any sort of randomization
2014-07-08 01:26:46	@Espyo	eggs in P2, for instance
2014-07-08 01:26:51	@Espyo	the layout of caves...
2014-07-08 01:27:02	@Espyo	but yeah, about the P3 eggs, I mean the content
2014-07-08 01:27:05	@Espyo	is it always the same?
2014-07-08 01:27:08	@Espyo	or is it randomized?
2014-07-08 01:27:08	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-08 01:27:09	@PikFan	no
2014-07-08 01:27:23	@PikFan	they're randomized
2014-07-08 01:27:29	@Espyo	ah, I'll point that too
2014-07-08 01:27:31	@Espyo	every egg I break
2014-07-08 01:27:36	@PikFan	17:25	Espyo	what about the outcome of eggs?
2014-07-08 01:27:44	@PikFan	now I understand what you meant by that
2014-07-08 01:27:46	@Espyo	so I can get chances on something giving out something
2014-07-08 01:27:47	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-08 01:27:54	@Espyo	anything else, at all, that you remember is random in the game?
2014-07-08 01:28:14	@PikFan	hmm, I'd have to play through again
2014-07-08 01:28:24	@PikFan	oh, I just remembered
2014-07-08 01:28:42	@Espyo	normally, if you just think about an area's sections, you can remember loads
2014-07-08 01:28:46	@PikFan	in Mission Mode, there will be Pikmin buried in the ground
2014-07-08 01:29:03	@Espyo	like, if I needed to remember anything that reacts specially to a Pikmin throw
2014-07-08 01:29:06	@Espyo	I can go through the areas
2014-07-08 01:29:12	@Espyo	The Impact Site...
2014-07-08 01:29:13	@PikFan	they stay in the same general area, but each time a level is loaded, they move slightly
2014-07-08 01:29:31	@Espyo	there's the landing site, the pellets, then you find an Iridescent Flint Beetle
2014-07-08 01:29:41	@Espyo	and there you go, already something that reacts differently — the IFB
2014-07-08 01:29:51	@Espyo	so yeah, try to overview the areas real quick
2014-07-08 01:29:54	@Espyo	to remember anything that's random
2014-07-08 01:30:13	@PikFan	the spectralids fly around randomly
2014-07-08 01:30:18	@Espyo	hmm, I'll keep a look out for all of that
2014-07-08 01:32:34	@Espyo	brb
2014-07-08 01:40:31	@Espyo	ok, so you said the golden things are called data files
2014-07-08 01:40:34	@Espyo	...that's a problem
2014-07-08 01:40:42	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Menu#Data_file_selection
2014-07-08 01:40:53	@Espyo	and to make matters worse, I was planning on making a [[Data file]] article
2014-07-08 01:40:53	Testyo	"Data_file" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Data_file
2014-07-08 01:41:06	@PikFan	disambig
2014-07-08 01:41:17	@Espyo	one that contains data on what the games save, how many blocks they take up, details on the saving progres...
2014-07-08 01:41:22	@Espyo	yeah, but that raises some more problems
2014-07-08 01:41:29	@Espyo	one tiny problem is people finding it weird
2014-07-08 01:41:32	@Espyo	but whatever
2014-07-08 01:41:39	@Espyo	another problem is: what are they called in P3?
2014-07-08 01:41:47	@Espyo	what names appear on the save selection screen?
2014-07-08 01:41:54	@Espyo	what names appear on the manual?
2014-07-08 01:42:04	@PikFan	names of what?
2014-07-08 01:42:26	@Espyo	what the game calls a "save file"
2014-07-08 01:42:27	@PikFan	...oh
2014-07-08 01:42:31	@Espyo	P1 and P2 call save files "data files"
2014-07-08 01:42:45	@PikFan	huh, weird
2014-07-08 01:42:46	@Espyo	if P3 calls it something different, which name will we use for the article that details saved games?
2014-07-08 01:43:07	@PikFan	in P1 and 2, the file selection screen says Ship's log
2014-07-08 01:43:24	@PikFan	like Ship's log 1, 2, 3
2014-07-08 01:43:29	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-08 01:43:49	@PikFan	hmm, I'd have to boot up P3
2014-07-08 01:43:58	@Espyo	watch a video
2014-07-08 01:44:05	@Espyo	a playthrough should show right away
2014-07-08 01:44:14	@Espyo	there might even be screenshots you can find on google
2014-07-08 01:44:23	@Espyo	ah, P2 calls them Ship's Log
2014-07-08 01:44:30	@Espyo	but P1 calls them Data File and Ship's Log
2014-07-08 01:44:45	@Espyo	Data File is on the top of the screen: "Choose a Data File"
2014-07-08 01:45:17	@Espyo	page 18 of the manual also calls them data files
2014-07-08 01:46:08	@Espyo	P2 manual calls them Ship's Logs
2014-07-08 01:46:17	@Espyo	(and game files, but that name isn't really the actual name)
2014-07-08 01:46:26	@Espyo	now we just need to know what P3 calls them..
2014-07-08 01:46:27	@Espyo	*.
2014-07-08 01:48:07	@PikFan	ok so there's "Story", and under it is, "Choose a day."
2014-07-08 01:48:33	@PikFan	http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll132/green111pikminrules/Untitled_zps1940e999.png
2014-07-08 01:48:54	@Espyo	:|
2014-07-08 01:48:59	@PikFan	that big bubble at the top is Story, and the stuff under is Choose a day.
2014-07-08 01:49:03	@Espyo	what about the long text on the second bubble from the to--
2014-07-08 01:49:04	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-08 01:49:15	@Espyo	wait, there's only one save file in P3?
2014-07-08 01:49:23	@PikFan	there's only one save file, which is—yes
2014-07-08 01:49:29	@Espyo	what is this nonsense
2014-07-08 01:49:32	@PikFan	which is stupid
2014-07-08 01:49:48	@Espyo	P1 takes 19 huge blocks of memory card data
2014-07-08 01:50:00	@Espyo	NPC!P1 saves each day, so it probably takes at least 4 times as much
2014-07-08 01:50:05	@Espyo	and P3 couldn't do it?
2014-07-08 01:50:05	@Espyo	bah
2014-07-08 01:50:23	@Espyo	gaargh, what about the manual, any info there?
2014-07-08 01:50:26	@PikFan	you can replay from earlier days, but if you want to save and go on, it erases the stuff that's already saved
2014-07-08 01:50:32	@PikFan	there's no manual...
2014-07-08 01:50:38	@Espyo	what
2014-07-08 01:50:42	@PikFan	there might be an e-manual, let me check
2014-07-08 01:51:06	@PikFan	yep, e-manual
2014-07-08 01:51:44	@PikFan	ooh, found a page that describes the HUD
2014-07-08 01:51:48	@Espyo	at least that
2014-07-08 01:51:49	@Espyo	oooh
2014-07-08 01:52:46	@PikFan	1. Sun meter: Indicates the current time of the day. When the sun reaches the far-right side of the meter, the day will end.
2014-07-08 01:53:37	@PikFan	2. Space-suit damage meters: The current leader's damage meter is displayed at the bottom. If the damage meter of each character completely empties, the day will end.
2014-07-08 01:53:47	@PikFan	3. Day display
2014-07-08 01:54:22	@PikFan	4. Juice left: Displays the number of days' worth of juice remaining.
2014-07-08 01:54:30	@PikFan	5. Fruit collected
2014-07-08 01:54:40	@Espyo	hm, but what about the save file?
2014-07-08 01:54:43	@Espyo	the HUD can be filled in later
2014-07-08 01:54:47	@Espyo	when all the P3 info comes
2014-07-08 01:54:57	@PikFan	6. Pikmin or crewmate to be thrown: Shows the Pikmin type or crewmate ready to be thrown.
2014-07-08 01:55:51	@PikFan	ah, found it
2014-07-08 01:56:25	@PikFan	"Select a day to continue in Story mode from that point. You can switch days by toggling L control stick left and right.
2014-07-08 01:56:56	@PikFan	*If you replay an earlier day, save data for subsequent days will be erased when the game is saved at the end of the current day.
2014-07-08 01:57:35	@PikFan	*Check carefully before you return to an earlier day. Save data cannot be restored once it is erased.
2014-07-08 01:57:49	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-08 01:57:50	@PikFan	*Check carefully before you return to an earlier day. Save data cannot be restored once it is erased.
2014-07-08 01:57:56	@PikFan	that's what I meant
2014-07-08 01:58:29	@PikFan	Saving Data: Your progress will be saved automatically at the end of each day in Story mode and when you finish a mission or Bingo Battle.
2014-07-08 01:58:32	@Espyo	oh, that's not as ominous
2014-07-08 01:58:50	@Espyo	well...
2014-07-08 01:58:51	@PikFan	that's it
2014-07-08 01:58:59	@Espyo	so P1 calls it Ship's Log and Data file
2014-07-08 01:59:03	@Espyo	P2 calls it Ship's Log
2014-07-08 01:59:05	@Espyo	P3 calls it nothing
2014-07-08 01:59:15	@Espyo	I'd say we go for [[Save file]]
2014-07-08 01:59:15	Testyo	"Save_file" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Save_file
2014-07-08 01:59:22	@Espyo	because it's a widely-known term
2014-07-08 01:59:38	@PikFan	ooooh, I found controls
2014-07-08 01:59:44	@Espyo	wikipedia has "Saved game"
2014-07-08 01:59:46	@PikFan	stylus mode controls
2014-07-08 01:59:46	@Espyo	hmmmmm...
2014-07-08 01:59:52	@Espyo	[[wikipedia:Saved game]]
2014-07-08 01:59:53	Testyo	"wikipedia:Saved_game" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=wikipedia:Saved_game
2014-07-08 02:00:00	@Espyo	haha, that links works
2014-07-08 02:00:14	@PikFan	wait, /what/
2014-07-08 02:00:16	@PikFan	how?
2014-07-08 02:00:35	@PikFan	oh, you should add a w prefix
2014-07-08 02:01:46	@Espyo	but this is for Pikipedia and fanon, not really wikipedia
2014-07-08 02:01:57	@PikFan	hm, true
2014-07-08 02:02:04	@Espyo	but I could add google and such
2014-07-08 02:02:16	@Espyo	it's just that we NEVER link to Google or Wikipedia results
2014-07-08 02:02:28	@Espyo	all right, I guess "saved game" is the way t go
2014-07-08 02:02:28	@Espyo	*to
2014-07-08 02:02:34	@Espyo	not even the canon games can reach a consensus
2014-07-08 02:02:53	@PikFan	majority rule
2014-07-08 02:02:56	@Espyo	Ship's Log is more like the in-universe coated term
2014-07-08 02:03:09	@Espyo	I mean, it's a saved game, but called that because of the game's theme
2014-07-08 02:03:20	@Espyo	but because a saved game is a real world thing, we should go with the real world name
2014-07-08 02:03:26	@Espyo	unless we have a good in-universe name
2014-07-08 02:03:28	@Espyo	which we don't
2014-07-08 02:03:37	@Espyo	as for "data file", let's forget that idea altogether
2014-07-08 02:03:44	@Espyo	data file is JUST the golden things, end of story
2014-07-08 02:03:54	@Espyo	though, I could add a {{for}} on top of the data file article
2014-07-08 02:03:55	Testyo	"for" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:for
2014-07-08 02:04:25	@Espyo	For the persistence of progress in a playthrough, see Saved game.
2014-07-08 02:06:02	@Espyo	A saved game (known as Ship's Log in Pikmin and Pikmin 2, but also Data File in the former, and otherwise known as savegame, save file (...)) is a (...)
2014-07-08 02:06:14	@Espyo	that sounds good
2014-07-08 02:10:10	@PikFan	alright, going back out, even though it's... oh, only 94F

2014-07-08 21:59:59	@Espyo	I figured
2014-07-08 22:00:09	@Espyo	but where did they get the value from, then?
2014-07-08 22:00:14	@Espyo	and also, how DID you get the P1 value?
2014-07-08 22:05:45	@J	did I do it?

2014-07-08 22:07:56	@Espyo	well, fair enough
2014-07-08 22:08:09	@Espyo	except... how do you get the address for an enemy?
2014-07-08 22:08:13	@Espyo	oh, save-states, I'm guessing
2014-07-08 22:08:22	@Espyo	damage an enemy, get a decreased value
2014-07-08 22:08:25	@Espyo	damage some more, decreased
2014-07-08 22:08:32	@Espyo	then reload save to get the max HP
2014-07-08 22:08:36	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2014-07-08 22:15:38	@Espyo	WELL THEN
2014-07-08 22:15:54	@Espyo	apparently the Pikmin 2 manual calls the sprays with every letter capitalized
2014-07-08 22:15:58	@Espyo	"Ultra-Spicy Spray"
2014-07-08 22:16:07	@Espyo	but in-game, they're all lowercase, "ultra-spicy spray"
2014-07-08 22:16:23	@Espyo	I've been changing the spelling on articles to the uppercase one...
2014-07-08 22:16:43	@Espyo	now I'm not sure if I should keep going, do the opposite, or leave it as-is
2014-07-08 22:17:08	@Espyo	might as well open a discussion for it some point later

2014-07-09 22:09:57	@J	I'm currently looking at a window manager that works using 'selections' on windows, desktops and monitors, and you perform actions on selections
2014-07-09 22:10:12	@J	so you can do things like swap the largest window with the focused window
2014-07-09 22:10:35	@J	or move the previously focused window to the previously focused desktop
2014-07-09 22:11:39	@Espyo	oh, nice
2014-07-09 22:20:40	@Espyo	so... WHY didn't we point down the Toady Bloyster's HP?

2014-07-09 22:21:15	@Espyo	same for the Honeywisp
2014-07-09 22:21:31	@J	maybe someone removed them

2014-07-09 22:21:51	@Espyo	the Honeywisp has 99999 HP
2014-07-09 22:23:05	@J	well, you don't kill it, so I guess it's just one of those 'make it high enough to avoid any weird glitches killing it somehow'

2014-07-14 21:06:16	@J	someone say something please
2014-07-14 21:06:55	@Espyo	something please
2014-07-14 21:07:45	@J	hmm, that's strange
2014-07-14 21:08:03	@J	the command I was testing works, but the shortcut that has the exact same command doesn't
2014-07-14 21:08:23	@J	and, hey, you know what would be a good addition to Testyo?  'Say something in x seconds'
2014-07-14 21:10:48	Miles	something in x seconds
2014-07-14 21:11:30	@J	okay, the shortcut only works when I'm focused on another window
2014-07-14 21:15:06	@Espyo	but
2014-07-14 21:15:09	@Espyo	nobody would ever use it
2014-07-14 21:15:13	@Espyo	except for your crazy experiments
2014-07-14 21:21:47	@J	hey, I've had to test notifications many times in the past
2014-07-14 21:23:21	@Espyo	can't really imagine how useful it'd be, tbh
2014-07-14 21:24:11	@J	fine, I'll just have to find someone with really low ping and use that instead
2014-07-14 21:26:17	@Espyo	but
2014-07-14 21:26:22	@Espyo	delayed messages = more ping
2014-07-14 21:28:58	@J	*really high ping
2014-07-14 21:30:12	@Espyo	yes
2014-07-14 21:30:15	@Espyo	so why do you need low ping?
2014-07-14 21:30:19	@Espyo	silly J, that won't work
2014-07-14 21:30:28	@J	I was correcting myself
2014-07-14 21:30:33	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-14 21:30:48	@Espyo	are you gonna need such a thing any time soon?
2014-07-14 21:31:00	@Espyo	or was this just for a crazy experiment you did today?
2014-07-14 21:32:35	@J	yeah, just today
2014-07-14 21:32:46	@J	I mean, in the future, who knows
2014-07-14 21:32:52	@J	but not planned
2014-07-14 21:35:11	@J	so, I was actually productive this weekend
2014-07-14 21:35:20	@Espyo	eh, I'd do it, but I don't want to have to deal with the timer code
2014-07-14 21:35:25	@Espyo	it's not even ugly or sketchy, it's just...

2014-07-15 22:09:33	@J	do you think 'the output given by this command sometimes has a random blank line' counts as a bug?
2014-07-15 22:13:13	@Espyo	depends on the program
2014-07-15 22:13:38	@Espyo	why not just re-parse the final output and delete blank lines?
2014-07-15 22:13:51	@Espyo	the more I think about it, the more curious I am as to how you made that happen
2014-07-15 22:15:55	@J	yeah, of course it's easy to work around
2014-07-15 22:16:08	@J	just wondering if it's worth mentioning
2014-07-15 22:16:21	@J	I have a load of other questions, so I could just slip it in with them
2014-07-15 22:17:07	@J	it's the command to print a tree of all monitors/desktops/windows, and you seem to sometimes get blank lines when there are _lots_ of windows
2014-07-15 22:17:37	@J	around 50 windows on a desktop
2014-07-15 22:25:21	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-15 22:25:24	@Espyo	hmm, really weird, that
2014-07-15 22:25:36	@Espyo	but yeah, mention it

2014-07-16 00:12:49	@Espyo	whenever I try searching on Dolphin with Cheat Engine, I can never find anything

2014-07-16 00:13:06	@Espyo	not even single bytes
2014-07-16 00:14:40	@Espyo	oh, so that's where that setting is
2014-07-16 00:14:42	@Espyo	this might work now

2014-07-16 13:07:45	@PikFan	.
2014-07-16 13:07:52	@PikFan	ok so
2014-07-16 13:08:12	@PikFan	I found a new glitch in Pikmin
2014-07-16 13:10:17	@PikFan	like, if you have a drowning Pikmin on one side of a gate, whistling at them from the other side will make them swim /through/ the gate
2014-07-16 13:11:23	@PikFan	I accidentally discovered this while trying to bomb a bramble gate in a pond in the FoH
2014-07-16 13:12:19	@PikFan	I was running and throwing Yellow Pikmin, but they would land at the other side
2014-07-16 13:12:47	@PikFan	instinctively I whistled, and the Yellow Pikmin swam through the gate
2014-07-16 13:14:13	@PikFan	also at day 570 in Pikmin 2, 569 hours recorded
2014-07-16 13:14:41	@PikFan	with 50,000 Pikmin
2014-07-16 13:26:51	@PikFan	I don't know why I'm up right now... should be asleep
2014-07-16 13:27:08	@PikFan	guess I'll do that then

2014-07-16 14:41:19	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-07-16 14:41:26	@Espyo	so I cracked the code on how regeneration works in Pikmin 2
2014-07-16 14:41:34	@Espyo	the value is a multiplier for how much of its max health it heals
2014-07-16 14:41:49	@Espyo	like, 0.01 regen rate means it heals 1% of its max HP every frame
2014-07-16 14:42:03	@Espyo	plus, this is framerate-independent
2014-07-16 14:42:18	@Espyo	which means that over a second, an enemy has 25 of these 1% heals
2014-07-16 14:42:21	@Espyo	in Europe
2014-07-16 14:42:24	@Espyo	and elsewhere, 30
2014-07-16 14:42:31	@Espyo	meaning Europe actually has an advantage

2014-07-17 00:18:11	@Espyo	...
2014-07-17 00:18:13	@Espyo	anyway...
2014-07-17 00:18:14	@Espyo	your glitch
2014-07-17 00:18:44	@PikFan	mhm?
2014-07-17 00:20:10	@Espyo	how reproducible is it?
2014-07-17 00:20:14	@Espyo	and it's P1, right?
2014-07-17 00:20:18	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-17 00:20:25	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-17 00:20:31	@PikFan	let me go test it
2014-07-17 00:20:44	@PikFan	just to make sure
2014-07-17 00:23:34	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-17 00:27:08	@PikFan	high
2014-07-17 00:27:39	@PikFan	but you can do it ONLY with Yellows, even if the gate is almost destroyed
2014-07-17 00:28:58	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-17 00:29:10	@Espyo	well, care to add it to [[Glitches_in_Pikmin]]?
2014-07-17 00:29:11	Testyo	"Glitches_in_Pikmin" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Glitches_in_Pikmin
2014-07-17 00:29:32	@PikFan	what should I title it? "Swimming through Gates"?
2014-07-17 00:29:38	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-17 00:29:42	@Espyo	lowercase g, though
2014-07-17 00:30:01	@PikFan	oh, okay
2014-07-17 00:32:16	@PikFan	...where should I put it
2014-07-17 00:32:35	@PikFan	I'm leaning towards miscellaneous, but should it go under Pikmin...?
2014-07-17 00:32:45	@PikFan	*Pikmin-related
2014-07-17 00:32:49	@Espyo	Pikmin, imo
2014-07-17 00:33:05	@Espyo	also, I noticed some days ago that if the timer on the sunset warning reaches 4
2014-07-17 00:33:13	@Espyo	you can no longer heal at the S.S. Dolphin
2014-07-17 00:33:55	@PikFan	yeah, you also can't call out/send in Pikmin at the Onions
2014-07-17 00:34:00	@Espyo	oh, really?
2014-07-17 00:34:05	@Espyo	I should add that somewhere as well
2014-07-17 00:34:17	@Espyo	I learned the ship thing because I tried opening the ship's menu just as the day is ending
2014-07-17 00:34:25	@PikFan	yeah, it's like things become... disabled at sunset
2014-07-17 00:34:27	@Espyo	because there's a small delay between the press and the dialog opening
2014-07-17 00:34:48	@Espyo	and I figured that if I could make the game enter the sunset cutscene while the S.S. Dolphin's menu was opening...
2014-07-17 00:34:53	@Espyo	could result in something neat
2014-07-17 00:35:06	@Espyo	by menu, I mean the dialog that tells you how many ship parts are left
2014-07-17 00:35:16	@PikFan	right
2014-07-17 00:40:41	@PikFan	what would the explanation be?
2014-07-17 00:40:42	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] S.S. Dolphin by Espyo (+315 m Noted that you can't use it after the number 4.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=S.S._Dolphin&curid=1241&diff=82848&oldid=80309
2014-07-17 00:40:51	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-17 00:41:03	@Espyo	collision detection ignores objects while swimming?
2014-07-17 00:41:14	@Espyo	to make sure that Pikmin can swim to shore, and not die because there's a stupid obstacle in the way
2014-07-17 00:42:25	@PikFan	wait, the gate's collision detection?
2014-07-17 00:42:34	@Espyo	the Pikmin's
2014-07-17 00:42:41	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-17 00:43:01	@Espyo	while a Pikmin's swimming, it won't check for objects
2014-07-17 00:43:34	@Espyo	at least that's the theory
2014-07-17 00:43:37	@Espyo	if you could test, that'd be neat
2014-07-17 00:43:41	@Espyo	like, have a pellet in the way
2014-07-17 00:45:25	@Espyo	going to bed now, I have a job selection thing tomorrow
2014-07-17 00:45:37	@PikFan	hold on
2014-07-17 00:45:41	@PikFan	"     Effects: Makes a Yellow Pikmin swim through a gate.     Prerequisites: There needs to be an gate in a body of water.     How to: Holding a Yellow Pikmin, walk towards the gate and throw the Pikmin over the gate. Immediately after, call the Yellow Pikmin, which will then swim through the gate.     Notes: This can only be performed with Yellow Pikmin, due
2014-07-17 00:45:57	@PikFan	to their tall throw arc, even if the gate is lowered. Possible explanation: When swimming, the Pikmin's collision detection will ignore objects, so that the Pikmin can swim to the shore and live. "
2014-07-17 00:46:38	@Espyo	an undestroyed gate, maybe?
2014-07-17 00:47:07	@Espyo	and change the last bit to "so that the Pikmin can ALWAYS swim to the shore and live"
2014-07-17 00:47:09	@Espyo	(no caps)
2014-07-17 00:47:19	@PikFan	I tried that, but Firefox doesn't think it's a word

2014-07-17 00:47:32	@Espyo	well, there must be a synonym
2014-07-17 00:47:38	@Espyo	uh, raised?
2014-07-17 00:48:29	@PikFan	wait, where should this be
2014-07-17 00:48:38	@Espyo	the "raised"?
2014-07-17 00:48:41	@Espyo	in place of "undestroyed"
2014-07-17 00:48:44	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-17 00:49:27	@PikFan	but there's no undestroyed
2014-07-17 00:49:32	@Espyo	but
2014-07-17 00:49:41	@Espyo	you said you tried "undestroyed", and Firefox said it wasn't a word
2014-07-17 00:49:54	@PikFan	...OH
2014-07-17 00:49:56	@Espyo	well, just put any word that means that the gate is still not completely taken down
2014-07-17 00:50:08	@PikFan	I know where you wanted it
2014-07-17 00:50:24	@PikFan	"There needs to be an gate in a body of water."
2014-07-17 00:50:32	@Espyo	:|
2014-07-17 00:50:58	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-17 00:51:01	@PikFan	well, fixed that and added raised
2014-07-17 00:51:03	@Espyo	heh, I thought the word was there
2014-07-17 00:51:07	@Espyo	all right

2014-07-17 21:09:08	@J	of course, you should mention that no matter what happens, Wikia won't allow their wiki to be deprecated in any way
2014-07-17 21:09:33	@J	and I would like to be there, though I'm sure there's not much I would add to anything you would say
2014-07-17 21:09:41	@J	and it's not like I've been active at all lately
2014-07-17 21:09:52	@J	obviously in favour of IRC
2014-07-17 21:10:14	@J	just...don't insult them much, okay?
2014-07-17 21:11:00	@J	...hey, since when did the log in page get crazy-looking?
2014-07-17 21:33:29	@Espyo	oh, I'll be civil
2014-07-17 21:33:32	@Espyo	I want them to come to us
2014-07-17 21:33:38	@Espyo	I want the entire fanbase to be in one place
2014-07-17 21:33:52	@Espyo	since ages ago, if it's what I'm thinking of
2014-07-17 21:33:54	@Espyo	we talked about it
2014-07-17 21:34:02	@J	I don't think it's likely
2014-07-17 21:34:12	@J	that guy sounded like he wanted you to move there
2014-07-17 21:34:21	@Espyo	uh... it IS like the change from that last time
2014-07-17 21:34:25	@Espyo	except it's still differenter
2014-07-17 21:34:33	@Espyo	I mean, the log in screen's been like this for a while
2014-07-17 21:34:43	@Espyo	but I don't think the Log in button was always torquoise
2014-07-17 21:34:48	@Espyo	yeah, I kind of got that vibe too
2014-07-17 21:34:59	@Espyo	but no matter what happens, it is impossible to go to wikia
2014-07-17 21:35:04	@Espyo	I'll convince them to come to the superior website
2014-07-17 21:35:08	@J	yeah, I did fix the log in screen once before, didn't I?
2014-07-17 21:35:11	@Espyo	if they refuse, things will just go back to the way they were
2014-07-17 21:35:20	@Espyo	"fix" from this new style? don't think you ever did
2014-07-17 21:35:48	@J	even if they do move here, new people will start editing at Wikia, and it'll all happen again
2014-07-17 21:35:57	@Espyo	but not as strongly
2014-07-17 21:36:08	@Espyo	plus now we'd have to take some group effort to drive everybody away
2014-07-17 21:36:15	@Espyo	last time, it was a "meh, nobody'll go there, I'm sure of it"
2014-07-17 21:36:27	@Espyo	this time it'll be more like a "wikia is meant to be dead, and we want to make this clear"
2014-07-17 21:36:38	@Espyo	seems like a bit of a far-fetched dream, but hey, we never know
2014-07-17 21:36:46	@J	hmm, maybe I just noticed it ages ago and never bothered to fix it
2014-07-17 21:37:09	@J	yeah, I'm not saying don't try
2014-07-17 21:37:12	@J	just making predictions
2014-07-17 21:37:16	@Espyo	'course I'll try
2014-07-17 21:37:19	@Espyo	and 'course I predict that too
2014-07-17 21:37:38	@Espyo	but from the looks of things, at least that guy looks like he doesn't understand the split
2014-07-17 21:37:45	@Espyo	so it makes me think that most of them don't
2014-07-17 21:39:25	@Espyo	oh, and I'll add clauses
2014-07-17 21:39:29	@Espyo	I'll happily welcome them aboard
2014-07-17 21:39:36	@Espyo	so long as they actually WANT to stay
2014-07-17 21:39:42	@Espyo	and not just do it as a spontaneous thing
2014-07-17 21:39:53	@Espyo	and also they agree that we want Pikipedia to be a professional Pikmin encyclopedia
2014-07-17 21:39:56	@Espyo	so no cursor bs

2014-07-17 21:45:01	@Espyo	you'll know what I mean righ-- there you go
2014-07-17 21:45:03	@J	I do know
2014-07-17 21:45:19	@J	just cursor by itself has too many meanings
2014-07-17 21:45:26	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-07-17 21:45:32	@Espyo	also [[HUD#Cursor]]
2014-07-17 21:45:33	Testyo	"HUD#Cursor" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=HUD#Cursor
2014-07-17 21:46:09	@J	hmm, you've really been busy
2014-07-17 21:46:46	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-17 21:46:50	@Espyo	just felt like a spree
2014-07-17 21:47:00	@Espyo	though I did create [[HUD]] like a month ago
2014-07-17 21:47:01	Testyo	"HUD" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=HUD
2014-07-17 21:47:02	@Espyo	...I think
2014-07-17 21:50:10	@Espyo	these articles are pretty fun to write
2014-07-17 21:50:20	@Espyo	I'm guessing they're fun to read, too, for the most prt
2014-07-17 21:50:21	@Espyo	*part
2014-07-17 21:50:32	@Espyo	because they have condensed info on the... mundane
2014-07-17 21:50:37	@Espyo	and sometimes have info you didn't know about
2014-07-17 21:56:02	@J	yeah, the random game internals quirks you discover
2014-07-17 21:56:31	@J	I would like to spend more time figuring out all that stuff, but there's also so much else I want to do
2014-07-17 21:56:36	@J	plus the laziness
2014-07-17 21:57:12	@J	hmm, BTW, what are you doing now?  I mean, you finished college, right?
2014-07-17 21:57:34	@Espyo	plus I'm already doing it
2014-07-17 21:57:41	@Espyo	there's still more to discover, but...
2014-07-17 21:57:47	@Espyo	funny you should mention that
2014-07-17 21:57:59	@Espyo	I was at a recruitment action today, as they call it
2014-07-17 21:58:10	@Espyo	I'm not even sure if that's the term, but it's the term here, and I learned it today
2014-07-17 21:58:25	@Espyo	but it's this thing where job candidates come together and have to complete a series of tests
2014-07-17 21:58:47	@Espyo	in my case, we had a few tests with 2 columns with symbols
2014-07-17 21:58:57	@Espyo	and the symbol on the right determined an action to perform on the symbol on the left
2014-07-17 21:59:15	@Espyo	like flip its image sideways, omit it, or ignore the operation on the next line
2014-07-17 21:59:18	@Espyo	and then we had to pick the outcome
2014-07-17 21:59:24	@Espyo	it got confusing really fast, but it was also pretty fun
2014-07-17 21:59:48	@Espyo	then some tests about our ability to understand the yes, no, and "not enough information to answer" of some questions
2014-07-17 21:59:53	@Espyo	and, obviously, some programming tests
2014-07-17 22:00:08	@Espyo	luckily they let us choose the language, and luckily, I happen to know file loading by heart
2014-07-17 22:00:16	@Espyo	otherwise I'd end up like my peers, lost
2014-07-17 22:00:28	@Espyo	they couldn't remember how to open and read files on their favorite languages

2014-07-17 22:39:10	@Espyo	and again, funny enough
2014-07-17 22:39:23	@Espyo	I just talked to my mum on the phone, because she talked to the guy that initially told me about the company
2014-07-17 22:39:31	@Espyo	and he says that for the next week or so, I won't be hearing anything
2014-07-17 22:39:39	@Espyo	but luckily, they will tell me SOMETHING
2014-07-17 22:39:44	@Espyo	even if it is "you didn't make the cut"
2014-07-17 22:39:49	@Espyo	this is kind of a weird company
2014-07-17 22:39:56	@Espyo	Critical Software is the major company
2014-07-17 22:39:58	@Espyo	serious business
2014-07-17 22:40:27	@Espyo	but the sub-company I applied for is more like... a place where they give newly-bachelerodrersts a job so they can start their professional lives
2014-07-17 22:40:43	@Espyo	they're still serious jobs, but the entire ambiance is aimed towards those that just finished college

2014-07-18 20:05:15	@Espyo	I think it happened to Miles, even
2014-07-18 20:06:23	Miles_	Day 8 part 1 sublevel 4
2014-07-18 20:06:43	@Espyo	awesome, thanks
2014-07-18 20:08:25	@Espyo	do we know exactly why this happens?
2014-07-18 20:08:31	@Espyo	or is it just "lighting messes it up sometimes"?
2014-07-18 20:08:40	@Espyo	'cause that's what I'm going to add to [[Spray drop]]

2014-07-18 20:21:26	Miles_	I have no idea, considering it's only happened to me once (...that I know of)

2014-07-18 21:43:00	@Espyo	hey, the convo is starting, J
2014-07-18 21:44:38	@J	invite me?
2014-07-18 21:46:40	@Espyo	trying to
2014-07-18 21:46:48	@Espyo	they're a bit skeptical; you're not THAT active
2014-07-18 21:47:19	@J	being an admin isn't enough?
2014-07-18 21:47:39	@Espyo	apparently not
2014-07-18 21:47:50	@Espyo	and it looks like they might be talking behind our backs
2014-07-18 21:47:56	@Espyo	...we are too, right now, but whatever
2014-07-18 21:49:40	@Espyo	it's not just me that's not understanding what he means, is it?
2014-07-18 22:00:28	@J	he's just defensive because you're badmouthing Wikia; it's only natural
2014-07-18 22:14:56	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-18 22:15:08	@Espyo	granted, he's posting stuff that makes me see wikia in a slightly more positive light
2014-07-18 22:15:13	@Espyo	like disablable achievements
2014-07-18 22:15:16	@Espyo	but that doesn't mean much
2014-07-18 22:15:26	@J	I didn't even know there were achievements
2014-07-18 22:17:18	@Espyo	there are
2014-07-18 22:17:25	@Espyo	they're just as insane as you might think
2014-07-18 22:17:30	@J	you sound like you're speculating a lot
2014-07-18 22:17:44	@J	have you actually seen how such a system affects a wiki?
2014-07-18 22:17:50	@Espyo	I read the achievement's descriptions
2014-07-18 22:17:52	@J	I mean, I think you're right, but it's still speculation
2014-07-18 22:17:58	@Espyo	I have not, but I have seen how people react to achievements

2014-07-18 23:04:26	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-18 23:05:17	@Espyo	it's going... so-so
2014-07-18 23:05:17	@PikFan	also about the ujadani
2014-07-18 23:05:22	@Espyo	yeah?
2014-07-18 23:05:24	@PikFan	I already knew about it
2014-07-18 23:05:32	@Espyo	oh, because it's not on the page...
2014-07-18 23:05:39	@Espyo	and, well, it REALLY should
2014-07-18 23:05:43	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-18 23:06:11	@PikFan	but yeah, I attack the ujadani, get the sprays, which takes about half a day
2014-07-18 23:06:18	@Espyo	:|
2014-07-18 23:06:22	@Espyo	how can it take half a day
2014-07-18 23:06:32	@Espyo	oh, the other ones too
2014-07-18 23:07:03	@PikFan	then go in the Dream Den—*shrug*—, attack the Titan Dweevil and get sprays, then go back up and attack the ujadani again
2014-07-18 23:07:22	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmm
2014-07-18 23:07:33	@PikFan	oh yeah, today is day 571
2014-07-18 23:07:42	@PikFan	so ujadani appears today
2014-07-18 23:08:02	@PikFan	I should record how many sprays I start out with and end up with
2014-07-18 23:08:21	@PikFan	anyway, about the discussion
2014-07-18 23:08:32	@PikFan	you said it's going "so-so"...?
2014-07-18 23:09:00	@Espyo	that'd be good
2014-07-18 23:09:12	@Espyo	I'll add the cave-reset thing to the page
2014-07-18 23:09:21	@Espyo	we've discussed a couple of things
2014-07-18 23:09:26	@Espyo	mostly things that are bad with wikia
2014-07-18 23:09:29	@Espyo	some, they defended
2014-07-18 23:09:31	@Espyo	others, they agreed
2014-07-18 23:09:39	@Espyo	and it's not really going places
2014-07-18 23:09:43	@PikFan	like what?
2014-07-18 23:09:58	@Espyo	the slideshow system, the talk page system, the ad space...
2014-07-18 23:10:25	@Espyo	I'll try telling them that it's in my best interest to unite the community
2014-07-18 23:10:32	@Espyo	see if I could swerve them into being ok with joining Pikipedia
2014-07-18 23:10:34	@PikFan	I hope they didn't defend those... :s

2014-07-18 23:11:26	@Espyo	kinda
2014-07-18 23:11:29	@Espyo	a lot was talked about
2014-07-18 23:11:35	@Espyo	I'll just give you the full log later
2014-07-18 23:13:18	@Espyo	in the mean time — what gate did you use for the swimming glitch?
2014-07-18 23:15:26	@PikFan	southern FoH, in the small pond leading up to the Armored Cannon Beetle's arena
2014-07-18 23:16:13	@Espyo	ah
2014-07-18 23:16:28	@PikFan	I was trying to bomb it with Yellows
2014-07-18 23:16:35	@PikFan	then I discovered that glitch
2014-07-18 23:17:27	@PikFan	wait, are you talking to the wikians right now?
2014-07-18 23:21:38	@Espyo	yeah, still
2014-07-18 23:21:55	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-18 23:22:08	@PikFan	I'm considering making a Skype account
2014-07-18 23:23:03	@PikFan	you guys are using the text-based part, right?
2014-07-18 23:26:57	@Espyo	yeah, no voice
2014-07-18 23:27:05	@Espyo	I wouldn't really jump into voice-chat so straightly
2014-07-18 23:27:07	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-18 23:27:13	@PikFan	heh, me neither
2014-07-18 23:27:15	@Espyo	I'm no longer shy of my English speaking skills, but eesh, it's still something
2014-07-18 23:28:10	@Espyo	we've come to a point where we agree that none of us want a split
2014-07-18 23:28:17	@Espyo	but now... they're pulling us to wikia, and we're pulling them here
2014-07-18 23:28:21	@Espyo	let's see where this takes us
2014-07-18 23:29:25	@J	well, it's pretty obvious that's where it was going before we started
2014-07-18 23:29:31	@Espyo	yes
2014-07-18 23:29:38	@Espyo	but we just wanted to get the bullet points out of the way
2014-07-18 23:30:37	@PikFan	whatever happened to the list of wikia issues?
2014-07-18 23:30:51	@PikFan	...we still have that, right?
2014-07-18 23:31:01	@Espyo	we do
2014-07-18 23:31:03	@Espyo	I'm not sharing that
2014-07-18 23:31:11	@Espyo	that's pretty derogatory
2014-07-18 23:31:14	@PikFan	yeah, that'd be bad
2014-07-18 23:31:23	@Espyo	but I did fetch ideas from it
2014-07-18 23:38:51	@Espyo	the admins aren't bad people
2014-07-18 23:38:58	@Espyo	even they admit they're swarmed with noobs
2014-07-18 23:39:16	@PikFan	well yeah, they're not bad
2014-07-18 23:39:28	@PikFan	just... the wiki itself has numerous problems
2014-07-18 23:39:46	@Espyo	chances are, we'll want to merge, but they won't want to come here
2014-07-18 23:39:52	@Espyo	no matter what happens, we will never go to wikia
2014-07-18 23:40:01	@Espyo	having the community split is horrible, but going there is not an option
2014-07-18 23:40:10	@Espyo	we can only hope we can bring them to us and end the era of horror of wikia
2014-07-18 23:40:25	@PikFan	right, but
2014-07-18 23:40:38	@PikFan	what happens they decide to come here
2014-07-18 23:40:44	@PikFan	and leave wikia behind
2014-07-18 23:41:00	@PikFan	and then Nintendo decides to make a Pikmin 4 or something
2014-07-18 23:41:10	@PikFan	and the wikia site becomes active with new editors?
2014-07-18 23:41:53	@PikFan	*what happens if
2014-07-18 23:42:02	@J	*when
2014-07-18 23:42:10	@Espyo	we can't let it happen
2014-07-18 23:42:15	@Espyo	this time, we won't have 3 people to combat it
2014-07-18 23:42:18	@Espyo	we'll have the community
2014-07-18 23:42:21	@Espyo	if they come here, that's it
2014-07-18 23:42:23	@Espyo	everybody comes here
2014-07-18 23:42:24	@Espyo	forever
2014-07-18 23:42:28	@Espyo	this will be the end-all be-all wiki
2014-07-18 23:42:52	@PikFan	then we'll have to face the problem of being at the top of search results
2014-07-18 23:43:01	@Espyo	no worries
2014-07-18 23:43:06	@Espyo	we can call the people who go there back
2014-07-18 23:43:10	@Espyo	wikia can't stop an army
2014-07-18 23:43:15	@Espyo	plus with more people, we get more popular
2014-07-18 23:43:21	@PikFan	they can try...
2014-07-18 23:43:31	@PikFan	inb4 wikia admins ban everybody
2014-07-18 23:43:51	@Espyo	too bad
2014-07-18 23:44:06	@Espyo	heh, and this guy got surprised that I was the one that added some things to tcrf
2014-07-18 23:44:13	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-18 23:45:38	@PikFan	but yeah
2014-07-18 23:45:55	@PikFan	we just gotta convince them that we are a good wiki, with good people
2014-07-18 23:46:00	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-18 23:46:14	@PikFan	we dislike wikia
2014-07-18 23:46:26	@PikFan	and some parts of their wiki
2014-07-18 23:46:40	@PikFan	but I bet that the people there have good intentions
2014-07-18 23:46:55	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-18 23:47:11	@PikFan	if we had more of a community here, convincing them would be a bit easier
2014-07-18 23:48:02	@PikFan	I need to see how the old Pikmin Fanon is doing

2014-07-19 00:40:10	@Espyo	just imagine... actually having the entire community in one place
2014-07-19 00:40:25	@Espyo	sure, half of them are kids who would just spam the entire chatroom on discussions like what your favorite spray is
2014-07-19 00:40:41	@Espyo	but it would be better than having 2 people that discuss programming, games, and food

2014-07-19 01:09:35	@Espyo	we pretty much have them

2014-07-19 01:12:08	@Espyo	it's still not in the clear
2014-07-19 01:12:14	@Espyo	they're considering it, but you never know
2014-07-19 01:12:22	@PikFan	why haven't you become an admin yet?
2014-07-19 01:12:38	@PikFan	heck you could be bureaucrat
2014-07-19 01:13:18	@Espyo	only because we never got around to it
2014-07-19 01:13:23	@Espyo	ugh, it makes me happy to see this happen
2014-07-19 01:13:25	@Espyo	I can hardly believe it
2014-07-19 01:13:30	@Espyo	there will come a bit of a pain with it
2014-07-19 01:13:32	@PikFan	yeah, no kidding....
2014-07-19 01:13:40	@Espyo	the younger users will keep babbling on and on about stupid things
2014-07-19 01:13:43	@Espyo	you know, as kids do
2014-07-19 01:13:47	@PikFan	we didn't think this would happen
2014-07-19 01:13:55	@Espyo	but it'll be infinite times better than just two, maybe 3 people talking about whatever
2014-07-19 01:13:56	@PikFan	heh, that reminds me of someone
2014-07-19 01:14:00	 *	@PikFan looks at himself
2014-07-19 01:14:05	@Espyo	this is hardly #Pikipedia, it's more like #Stuff
2014-07-19 01:14:08	@Espyo	heh, not you
2014-07-19 01:14:11	@Espyo	you're young, but you're no kid
2014-07-19 01:14:18	@Espyo	you're one of the most mature youngsters I ever saw
2014-07-19 01:14:25	@Espyo	when you told me your age some months back, I was shocked
2014-07-19 01:14:31	@PikFan	oh trust me, there are plenty of times I've ranted about silly stuff
2014-07-19 01:14:37	@PikFan	just not on IRC
2014-07-19 01:14:58	@Espyo	hehe, I see
2014-07-19 01:15:02	@PikFan	hah, have modern-day teenagers made that big of an impression on you?
2014-07-19 01:15:12	@Espyo	they have
2014-07-19 01:15:17	@Espyo	well, half
2014-07-19 01:15:24	@PikFan	...half?
2014-07-19 01:15:30	@Espyo	on one side, all I imagine teens of nowadays is... you know, the stupid gits that they are
2014-07-19 01:15:35	@Espyo	teens back in my day weren't this bad >_>
2014-07-19 01:15:44	@Espyo	the other half is that I always envisioned kids as being kids
2014-07-19 01:15:47	@Espyo	and even young teens
2014-07-19 01:15:48	@PikFan	we can only blame ourselves
2014-07-19 01:15:56	@PikFan	anyway...
2014-07-19 01:15:58	@Espyo	regardless of behavior and such, young teens are still young
2014-07-19 01:16:03	@Espyo	and you're really mature for your age
2014-07-19 01:16:12	@Espyo	I don't mean like "you're really not a retard for your age"
2014-07-19 01:16:14	@Espyo	I mean actual mature
2014-07-19 01:16:33	@PikFan	yeah, I've always been a bit more... how shall I say, collected for my age
2014-07-19 01:16:49	@PikFan	so then
2014-07-19 01:16:58	@PikFan	we've laid down our ideas
2014-07-19 01:17:08	@PikFan	now we have to turn them into reality
2014-07-19 01:17:21	@PikFan	of course there will be a few bumps
2014-07-19 01:17:29	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 01:17:35	@PikFan	nevertheless I can almost picture it happening
2014-07-19 01:17:36	@Espyo	oh, one of them said they want info on one thing
2014-07-19 01:17:40	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-07-19 01:18:51	@Espyo	oh, they just wanted to know if it's possible to port the pages
2014-07-19 01:18:53	@Espyo	and it is
2014-07-19 01:19:25	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-19 01:19:29	@PikFan	yeah, import/export
2014-07-19 01:19:37	@PikFan	we'll need J's help for that
2014-07-19 01:19:43	@PikFan	and one of the admins over there
2014-07-19 01:20:25	@PikFan	J still has GPBot, right?
2014-07-19 01:20:40	@PikFan	(or whatever it was called)
2014-07-19 01:20:45	@Espyo	he does
2014-07-19 01:20:50	@Espyo	I used him for the Carmageddon wiki
2014-07-19 01:20:58	@Espyo	and boy, did that help tremendously
2014-07-19 01:21:02	@PikFan	by the way, how's that going?
2014-07-19 01:21:04	@Espyo	pages can be imported and exported natively
2014-07-19 01:21:08	@Espyo	but images need J's tool
2014-07-19 01:21:11	@Espyo	actually going fine
2014-07-19 01:21:17	@Espyo	except the likes of .svg isn't really working
2014-07-19 01:21:25	@Espyo	I... haven't really done much on it lately
2014-07-19 01:21:26	@PikFan	oh, vector files
2014-07-19 01:21:30	@Espyo	because I've been on this Pikipedia spree
2014-07-19 01:21:36	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-19 01:21:47	@PikFan	aren't you like the admin of Carmageddon wiki
2014-07-19 01:21:54	@Espyo	but I can always excuse myself with the fact that, currently, Carmageddon: Reincarnation (the newest game, in develpoment) is STILL too laggy for my pc
2014-07-19 01:21:59	@Espyo	and if I can't play, I can't add info
2014-07-19 01:22:09	@Espyo	I'm not the admin of the wikia one, but I am of the new official wiki
2014-07-19 01:22:31	@PikFan	sneaky
2014-07-19 01:23:58	@Espyo	but it is true, I'm afraid
2014-07-19 01:24:05	@Espyo	if I had time, I'd take care of both wikis, plus the engine
2014-07-19 01:24:07	@Espyo	heck, plus work
2014-07-19 01:24:08	@Espyo	but...
2014-07-19 01:24:15	@Espyo	speaking of work, I went on a recruitment action yesterday
2014-07-19 01:24:17	@PikFan	oh yeah
2014-07-19 01:24:23	@Espyo	they gathered 12 candidates that signed up for job at the company
2014-07-19 01:24:27	@Espyo	and ran us through tests
2014-07-19 01:24:28	@PikFan	any major stuff about the engine?
2014-07-19 01:24:30	@PikFan	fun
2014-07-19 01:24:32	@Espyo	to test programming skills and such
2014-07-19 01:24:40	@Espyo	it actually went well, so possibly job soon
2014-07-19 01:24:46	@PikFan	hooray
2014-07-19 01:24:55	@Espyo	which yay because money, but nay because... 3/5 of my day busy
2014-07-19 01:25:15	@PikFan	so how many hours are you working?
2014-07-19 01:25:22	@Espyo	 8, the usual
2014-07-19 01:25:24	@Espyo	which really scared me
2014-07-19 01:25:31	@Espyo	because when I was an intern for college
2014-07-19 01:25:36	@Espyo	the guys there worked from 8 am to 8 pm
2014-07-19 01:25:37	@Espyo	 12 hours
2014-07-19 01:25:40	@Espyo	at least that's the idea I got
2014-07-19 01:25:42	@PikFan	at least you're not working 12—yeah
2014-07-19 01:25:48	@Espyo	because whenever I got there, at 9, they were already there
2014-07-19 01:25:52	@Espyo	so I'm guessing they start at 8
2014-07-19 01:25:57	@Espyo	and whenever I leave, at 6, they're still there
2014-07-19 01:26:00	@Espyo	so at least 7, or 8
2014-07-19 01:26:13	@Espyo	I think one day I stayed there extra, and saw that they leave at 8
2014-07-19 01:26:14	@Espyo	so...
2014-07-19 01:26:16	@Espyo	yikes
2014-07-19 01:26:19	@PikFan	yeesh
2014-07-19 01:26:41	@PikFan	clearly they like the idea of sitting in a chair all day...
2014-07-19 01:26:59	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-19 01:27:03	@Espyo	or maybe they just can't find a job elsewhere
2014-07-19 01:27:11	@Espyo	economy is tough, specially on our bloody country
2014-07-19 01:27:13	@PikFan	true
2014-07-19 01:27:17	@Espyo	with a 13% or so unemployment rate
2014-07-19 01:27:22	@Espyo	if you have some job, grab on to it
2014-07-19 01:27:40	@Espyo	granted, it's a job programming, and miraculously, there's actually a higher demand for that than there are people working
2014-07-19 01:27:45	@Espyo	the EXACT opposite of any other subject
2014-07-19 01:27:47	@Espyo	besides medicine
2014-07-19 01:27:50	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-19 01:27:56	@Espyo	so they could still choose another, less-tiring job if they wanted...
2014-07-19 01:28:05	@Espyo	but they might like it, so *shrug*
2014-07-19 01:28:06	@PikFan	it's amazing what people will do when they need something
2014-07-19 01:28:07	@Espyo	...well, this is new
2014-07-19 01:28:11	@PikFan	?
2014-07-19 01:28:13	@Espyo	I've typed for so long, and so much
2014-07-19 01:28:19	@Espyo	that I've lost perception of the keyboard
2014-07-19 01:28:27	@Espyo	I can't *feel* the keyboard as I normally would
2014-07-19 01:28:31	@Espyo	it feels... ethereal
2014-07-19 01:28:37	@Espyo	let... me go get a glass to drink
2014-07-19 01:28:44	@PikFan	just don't drop it
2014-07-19 01:29:50	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-19 01:29:53	@Espyo	I'm good, I guess
2014-07-19 01:29:55	@Espyo	hmm, as for the engine
2014-07-19 01:30:00	@Espyo	I showed them some gameplay, they liked it
2014-07-19 01:30:06	@Espyo	and I took some screenshots of my latest WIP
2014-07-19 01:30:10	@Espyo	it actually has shadows now
2014-07-19 01:30:14	@Espyo	and... compared to not having shadows
2014-07-19 01:30:18	@Espyo	it looks 400 times better
2014-07-19 01:30:20	@PikFan	ooh, you even showcased the engine?
2014-07-19 01:30:29	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikmin_fangame_engine%202014-07-19%2001-05-13-09.png
2014-07-19 01:30:29	@PikFan	*showed
2014-07-19 01:30:34	@Espyo	just screenshots
2014-07-19 01:30:52	@PikFan	woah
2014-07-19 01:31:01	@PikFan	ooh, the HUD looks much nicer
2014-07-19 01:31:47	@PikFan	you should post an update soon
2014-07-19 01:32:20	@Espyo	I want to do it after collisions are in place
2014-07-19 01:32:23	@Espyo	you can see walls and such
2014-07-19 01:32:27	@Espyo	but they go right through it
2014-07-19 01:32:29	@Espyo	and collisions...
2014-07-19 01:32:31	@Espyo	might take forever
2014-07-19 01:32:36	@Espyo	because it's freaking collisions
2014-07-19 01:32:40	@Espyo	say, does the map remind you of anything?
2014-07-19 01:32:43	@PikFan	oh boy
2014-07-19 01:32:57	@PikFan	looks like Impact Site or Forest of Hope
2014-07-19 01:33:02	@PikFan	moreso the former
2014-07-19 01:33:06	@Espyo	close, but not quite
2014-07-19 01:33:15	@Espyo	I drew the area on top of an existing map
2014-07-19 01:33:33	@PikFan	hm
2014-07-19 01:33:37	@PikFan	Awakening Wood?
2014-07-19 01:33:48	@Espyo	[[tuto2]]
2014-07-19 01:33:48	Testyo	"tuto2" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=tuto2
2014-07-19 01:33:53	@PikFan	ah
2014-07-19 01:34:00	@Espyo	I decided to go with a simple area
2014-07-19 01:34:05	@Espyo	and all areas in P1 and 2 are complex
2014-07-19 01:34:08	@PikFan	wouldn't have guessed
2014-07-19 01:34:08	@Espyo	so enter tuto2
2014-07-19 01:34:11	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-19 01:34:41	@PikFan	the shadows look different
2014-07-19 01:34:53	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-19 01:34:57	@PikFan	ok so
2014-07-19 01:35:10	@PikFan	last night I was playing Twilight Princess
2014-07-19 01:35:19	@PikFan	I decided to go look at some glitches
2014-07-19 01:35:21	@Espyo	yeah, it's not a perfect copy
2014-07-19 01:35:23	@Espyo	this is rendered by the engine
2014-07-19 01:35:29	@Espyo	there are loads in TP...
2014-07-19 01:35:37	@Espyo	uh, do we have anything else that can call the wikians over to us?
2014-07-19 01:35:44	@Espyo	I already brought up the engine, generated a lot of love
2014-07-19 01:36:03	@PikFan	hm
2014-07-19 01:36:17	@PikFan	let's see
2014-07-19 01:36:25	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-19 01:36:34	@Espyo	so they say they have 7 out of 24 votes to come to Pikipedia
2014-07-19 01:36:35	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User talk:RuddieTheRedBul... by PikFan23 (+80 /* Welcome! */ ) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User_talk:RuddieTheRedBulborb&curid=8884&diff=44741&oldid=44737
2014-07-19 01:36:38	@PikFan	gameplay mechanics, technical information, icons, {{button}}
2014-07-19 01:36:38	Testyo	"button" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:button
2014-07-19 01:36:51	@Espyo	and if the two final admins are in it, they'll move
2014-07-19 01:37:09	@PikFan	are there any against?
2014-07-19 01:37:41	@Espyo	I'll ask
2014-07-19 01:37:55	@PikFan	ok, this is the glitch I was using: http://zeldawiki.org/Glitches_in_Twilight_Princess#Map_Glitch
2014-07-19 01:38:20	@Espyo	map glitch? is this the one where you remove the disk...?
2014-07-19 01:38:24	@PikFan	no
2014-07-19 01:38:32	@Espyo	oh, it's closeish
2014-07-19 01:38:34	@Espyo	err
2014-07-19 01:38:37	@Espyo	no, but I know what it is
2014-07-19 01:38:46	@Espyo	I can't shake off a feeling of that glitch being very dangerous, though
2014-07-19 01:38:49	@Espyo	it shouldn't, but...
2014-07-19 01:38:49	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-19 01:38:57	@Espyo	also, why'd you list mechanics, technical info, etc.?
2014-07-19 01:38:59	@PikFan	yeah, I made the game freeze once
2014-07-19 01:39:15	@PikFan	17:35	Espyo	uh, do we have anything else that can call the wikians over to us?
2014-07-19 01:39:32	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-19 01:39:35	@Espyo	but they know of those
2014-07-19 01:39:37	@PikFan	well, I just thought of stuff that are interesting
2014-07-19 01:39:41	@Espyo	because apparently they've been stalking us
2014-07-19 01:39:43	@PikFan	okay
2014-07-19 01:39:56	@Espyo	they openly admit that they lack professionalism
2014-07-19 01:39:56	@PikFan	so they DO look up to us
2014-07-19 01:40:00	@Espyo	and they lack a lot of help
2014-07-19 01:40:02	@Espyo	they look up to us
2014-07-19 01:40:07	@Espyo	it's what I was thinking all alon
2014-07-19 01:40:08	@Espyo	*g
2014-07-19 01:40:15	@Espyo	we lack P3 info, but we're still the superior wiki
2014-07-19 01:40:18	@PikFan	they've got quantity
2014-07-19 01:40:23	@PikFan	we've got quality
2014-07-19 01:40:25	@Espyo	and they openly said that a lot of their articles are unpolished
2014-07-19 01:40:41	@Espyo	and that they do things like make an article, and then add the basic content, and forget about it
2014-07-19 01:41:05	@PikFan	yeah, I still need to go through and finish up all the fruit pages
2014-07-19 01:41:33	@Espyo	still no answers over the against votes
2014-07-19 01:41:38	@Espyo	well, from the looks of things, you won't need to
2014-07-19 01:41:41	@Espyo	as they'll get imported from wikia
2014-07-19 01:42:01	@PikFan	for example, [[Dawn Pustules]]
2014-07-19 01:42:02	Testyo	"Dawn_Pustules" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Dawn_Pustules
2014-07-19 01:42:12	@PikFan	how does that look?
2014-07-19 01:42:32	@Espyo	not horrible
2014-07-19 01:42:52	@PikFan	I take that as it needs more stuff
2014-07-19 01:43:12	@PikFan	uh
2014-07-19 01:43:22	@PikFan	"more stuff" is too vague
2014-07-19 01:43:28	@PikFan	improvement?
2014-07-19 01:43:50	@PikFan	meh
2014-07-19 01:44:11	@PikFan	well, the lack of sections and images bothers me
2014-07-19 01:44:18	@PikFan	brb
2014-07-19 01:45:47	@Espyo	I didn't read it, but I think it needs more stuff
2014-07-19 01:47:49	@PikFan	it definitely needs images
2014-07-19 01:47:51	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/talk.txt hope you have a free hour
2014-07-19 01:48:40	@PikFan	[18/07/2014 21:44:29] Zooty~Kun (Kawaii) (jpmrocks from Pikmin wikia): (we may or may not stalk pikipedia)
2014-07-19 01:48:48	@PikFan	lol
2014-07-19 01:49:48	@Espyo	the last... iunno, 30th of the conversation isn't anything any more
2014-07-19 01:49:55	@Espyo	it's past the point where they decided they were moving with this
2014-07-19 01:51:13	@Espyo	uff, it took over a minute to copy-paste all of that
2014-07-19 01:51:19	@PikFan	wow
2014-07-19 01:51:22	@Espyo	...oh, I could've just done ctrl+a
2014-07-19 01:51:25	@Espyo	that selects everything
2014-07-19 01:51:36	@Espyo	but I didn't think of it, so I had to drag from top to bottom
2014-07-19 01:51:37	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-19 01:57:52	@PikFan	about 1/6 the way down
2014-07-19 01:58:09	@PikFan	yeah, achievements are bad
2014-07-19 01:58:48	@PikFan	if a wiki were to ever have achievements (ugh), they should be meaningful
2014-07-19 01:59:10	@PikFan	not just like make x amount of edits or upload x amount of files
2014-07-19 02:03:02	@PikFan	oh yeah, wikipedia enabled slideshows :|
2014-07-19 02:03:13	@PikFan	so now I have to right-click files
2014-07-19 02:09:59	@Espyo	...
2014-07-19 02:15:03	@PikFan	[18/07/2014 23:16:00] André Silva - Espyo: this is the first we've heard of anybody from pikmin wikia in over 4 years
2014-07-19 02:15:11	@PikFan	that isn't true
2014-07-19 02:15:12	@Espyo	that's true... right?
2014-07-19 02:15:14	@Espyo	dammit
2014-07-19 02:15:18	@Espyo	well, it's kinda true... right?
2014-07-19 02:15:18	@PikFan	remember Bowblax last summer?
2014-07-19 02:15:23	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-07-19 02:15:27	@Espyo	but I meant like an admin
2014-07-19 02:15:34	@Espyo	he was just a random user who still wasn't sure of where to go
2014-07-19 02:15:34	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-19 02:15:43	@Espyo	he was like a wikian that came here just to know what's up
2014-07-19 02:15:53	@Espyo	instead of a person who knows the situation and wants us back there
2014-07-19 02:15:56	@PikFan	should've specified that
2014-07-19 02:16:01	@PikFan	but eh
2014-07-19 02:16:05	@Espyo	well, yeah, but they understood what we meant
2014-07-19 02:16:13	@Espyo	plus it didn't look like they knew about Bowblax
2014-07-19 02:16:13	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-19 02:16:15	@Espyo	or else they'd have said
2014-07-19 02:16:27	@Espyo	I have to admit, my arguments to show that wikia sucks didn't live up that well
2014-07-19 02:16:32	@Espyo	but I still got the general idea across
2014-07-19 02:16:48	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-19 02:17:09	@PikFan	so that was an admin-only chat? you guys didn't have a community chat or anything?
2014-07-19 02:17:58	@Espyo	admin-only
2014-07-19 02:18:10	@Espyo	they did talk to some fans, on their own pikmin wikia skype group
2014-07-19 02:18:16	@Espyo	that's where the votes are coming from
2014-07-19 02:18:16	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-19 02:18:22	@Espyo	think of an IRC channel, except located on skype
2014-07-19 02:18:22	@PikFan	oh, I see
2014-07-19 02:18:26	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-19 02:18:30	@Espyo	and glitchier, because Skype's pretty meh sometimes
2014-07-19 02:18:32	@Espyo	and less Testyo
2014-07-19 02:18:37	@Espyo	I'm sure they'll love Testyo
2014-07-19 02:18:37	@PikFan	OH
2014-07-19 02:18:47	@PikFan	yeah, gotta tell 'em about Testy here
2014-07-19 02:18:53	@Espyo	mhm, going to now
2014-07-19 02:19:05	@PikFan	...you're /still/ talking?
2014-07-19 02:19:23	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 02:19:25	@PikFan	surprised you haven't developed carpal tunnel yet
2014-07-19 02:19:27	@Espyo	want to join in?
2014-07-19 02:19:30	@Espyo	I type a lot
2014-07-19 02:19:34	@Espyo	I guess I'm used to it now
2014-07-19 02:19:37	@Espyo	but heh, fair point
2014-07-19 02:19:38	@PikFan	sure
2014-07-19 02:19:44	@PikFan	is it on skype?
2014-07-19 02:20:49	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 02:21:08	@PikFan	hm, might have to use my mom's account
2014-07-19 02:21:18	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-07-19 02:21:24	@PikFan	she's not comfortable with me making an account
2014-07-19 02:21:25	@Espyo	well, we're not talking as actively
2014-07-19 02:21:36	@PikFan	seriously, full name and city? ludicrous
2014-07-19 02:21:42	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-19 02:21:47	@Espyo	make up the full ame
2014-07-19 02:21:48	@Espyo	*name
2014-07-19 02:21:53	@Espyo	technically, you DON'T need the full name
2014-07-19 02:21:57	@Espyo	because apparently, mine isn't filled out
2014-07-19 02:22:01	@Espyo	it's André Silva - Espyo as a first name
2014-07-19 02:22:03	@Espyo	and no last name
2014-07-19 02:22:06	@Espyo	even though Silva is my last name
2014-07-19 02:22:14	@PikFan	hm
2014-07-19 02:22:30	@PikFan	oh, so I could just put in "PikFan" and that'd work?
2014-07-19 02:22:39	@Espyo	not sure
2014-07-19 02:22:56	@Espyo	maybe I don't have my last name filled up because I registered years ago
2014-07-19 02:22:58	@Espyo	before it was mandatory
2014-07-19 02:23:02	@Espyo	but you can always give it a shot
2014-07-19 02:23:08	@Espyo	try to create an account, don't fill in the last name
2014-07-19 02:23:12	@Espyo	and when you try to move forward
2014-07-19 02:23:19	@Espyo	if it insists, then well, you need a last name
2014-07-19 02:23:25	@Espyo	either make it up or cancel
2014-07-19 02:23:30	@Espyo	but if you can continue, there you go
2014-07-19 02:23:32	@PikFan	...oh
2014-07-19 02:23:43	@PikFan	"Fields marked with * are required."
2014-07-19 02:23:47	@PikFan	and last name has *
2014-07-19 02:23:53	@Espyo	well, two options
2014-07-19 02:24:10	@Espyo	either add something crazy
2014-07-19 02:24:16	@Espyo	or use your mums
2014-07-19 02:24:16	@Espyo	*'s
2014-07-19 02:24:35	@PikFan	eeeeeh
2014-07-19 02:24:40	@PikFan	meh
2014-07-19 02:24:48	@PikFan	I'll just use my mom's account
2014-07-19 02:25:00	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-19 02:25:07	@PikFan	I can just introduce myself
2014-07-19 02:25:20	@PikFan	then when they use IRC they'll recognize me
2014-07-19 02:25:43	@Espyo	right
2014-07-19 02:26:48	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User account Jpmrocks created http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Jpmrocks
2014-07-19 02:27:46	@Espyo	oh, here's one now
2014-07-19 02:27:58	@PikFan	yay!
2014-07-19 02:28:09	@PikFan	ok, so I've signed in
2014-07-19 02:28:18	@PikFan	now what?
2014-07-19 02:28:31	@PikFan	not really familiar with skype lol
2014-07-19 02:28:38	@Espyo	hmm, you'll have to add me
2014-07-19 02:28:44	@Espyo	go on contacts, add new
2014-07-19 02:28:47	@Espyo	then search "espyopt"
2014-07-19 02:28:50	@Espyo	I should be there right away
2014-07-19 02:28:56	@Espyo	then try to add me
2014-07-19 02:29:03	@Espyo	and everything from there on out is pretty straight-forward
2014-07-19 02:29:42	@PikFan	Andre Silva - Espyo Porto, Portugal
2014-07-19 02:29:45	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-19 02:29:49	@PikFan	'kay
2014-07-19 02:30:00	@Espyo	they still haven't given me the greenlight to add you
2014-07-19 02:30:08	@Espyo	hmm, they're probably Americans, like you
2014-07-19 02:30:12	@Espyo	so timezones might be nice to you
2014-07-19 02:30:16	@Espyo	...I won't have to say this, but
2014-07-19 02:30:25	@Espyo	please don't insult them
2014-07-19 02:30:28	@PikFan	ok, so I just sent you a request
2014-07-19 02:30:31	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-19 02:30:36	@PikFan	I won't
2014-07-19 02:30:45	@Espyo	this'll mean your mum will have a friend on her list next time she logs in
2014-07-19 02:30:52	@PikFan	yeah lol
2014-07-19 02:30:54	@Espyo	:|
2014-07-19 02:31:04	@Espyo	you sure you won't want to create your own account?
2014-07-19 02:31:10	@Espyo	she might think I'm a Nigerian prince up for a scam
2014-07-19 02:31:17	@PikFan	I'd rather not for the time being
2014-07-19 02:31:23	@PikFan	besides, I can explain
2014-07-19 02:31:34	@Espyo	does she trust me?
2014-07-19 02:31:43	@PikFan	I... don't know?
2014-07-19 02:31:45	@Espyo	like, does she know you have a Portuguese friend who's definitely not a serial killer?
2014-07-19 02:31:56	@PikFan	and who is 21
2014-07-19 02:31:58	@PikFan	or 22
2014-07-19 02:32:00	@PikFan	I forget
2014-07-19 02:32:30	@Espyo	 22
2014-07-19 02:32:35	@PikFan	ah
2014-07-19 02:32:44	@PikFan	anyway, back to the details
2014-07-19 02:32:45	@Espyo	well, I'd rather not add your mum's contact as a friend until everything is ok
2014-07-19 02:32:51	@Espyo	and they say you can join, btw
2014-07-19 02:32:54	@PikFan	ok

2014-07-19 02:33:41	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 02:33:52	@Espyo	try not to make it come off as impulsive or anything :|
2014-07-19 02:33:57	@Espyo	I'm not like this guy who suddenly wants something
2014-07-19 02:34:04	@Espyo	I'm your friend for like a year, maybe two
2014-07-19 02:34:47	@PikFan	yeah, she's fine

2014-07-19 11:36:52	@PikFan	also hi
2014-07-19 11:37:37	@PikFan	so a little while ago I made this template: {{tm}}
2014-07-19 11:37:38	Testyo	"tm" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:tm
2014-07-19 11:37:38	@Espyo	hi
2014-07-19 11:37:46	@Espyo	what does it do?
2014-07-19 11:37:51	@Espyo	(Firefox still hasn't loaded)
2014-07-19 11:37:56	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-19 11:38:24	@PikFan	well, you know how Winged Pikmin have special carrying abilities, right?
2014-07-19 11:38:35	@Espyo	uh, yeah?
2014-07-19 11:38:54	@PikFan	well, I decided to make a template about that, for infoboxes
2014-07-19 11:39:00	@PikFan	"tm" means true maximum
2014-07-19 11:39:19	@PikFan	...of course, being inexperienced, I ran into a problem
2014-07-19 11:39:24	@Espyo	oh, hmm
2014-07-19 11:39:38	@Espyo	not really seeing how the template might be used all that well
2014-07-19 11:39:42	@Espyo	but I'd have to check before saying anything
2014-07-19 11:40:08	@PikFan	see, in the max carriers parameter, when you enter a value, it's coded so that "Pikmin" will appear after the valye
2014-07-19 11:40:10	@PikFan	*value
2014-07-19 11:40:28	@PikFan	I didn't realize it before hand
2014-07-19 11:40:43	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-19 11:40:51	@PikFan	so it'd look like "20 Pikmin (29 Pikmin) Pikmin"
2014-07-19 11:40:58	@PikFan	on Red Bulborb
2014-07-19 11:41:02	@Espyo	right
2014-07-19 11:41:10	@Espyo	I'll cook up some parser template magic
2014-07-19 11:41:18	@Espyo	and make the template auto-calculate it
2014-07-19 11:41:26	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-19 11:41:31	@Espyo	like, try going on [[Swooping Snitchbug]]
2014-07-19 11:41:31	Testyo	"Swooping_Snitchbug" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Swooping_Snitchbug
2014-07-19 11:41:34	@Espyo	go to the technical info part
2014-07-19 11:41:39	@Espyo	and scroll to the regen rate
2014-07-19 11:41:44	@Espyo	and put your cursor on the number
2014-07-19 11:41:52	@Espyo	you should get a tooltip with values calculated on the fly
2014-07-19 11:42:30	@PikFan	there's no tooltip for the regen rate though
2014-07-19 11:42:41	@PikFan	but I kinda see what you're saying
2014-07-19 11:43:03	@Espyo	there isn't
2014-07-19 11:43:05	@Espyo	oh, nuts
2014-07-19 11:43:09	@Espyo	Swooping Snitchbugs don't regen
2014-07-19 11:43:15	@Espyo	[[Shearwig]]s do
2014-07-19 11:43:15	Testyo	"Shearwig" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Shearwig
2014-07-19 11:43:44	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-19 11:44:00	@Espyo	so yeah, using the formulate on [[Carrying]], it should be easy
2014-07-19 11:44:00	Testyo	"Carrying" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Carrying
2014-07-19 11:44:09	@PikFan	let's see... that formula was TM = —beat me to it
2014-07-19 11:44:16	@Espyo	we'd have to really point out to that section of Carrying, though
2014-07-19 11:44:25	@Espyo	or else people might wonder what the hell we mean by "true max"
2014-07-19 11:44:26	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-19 11:44:38	@PikFan	in the template I did link to carrying
2014-07-19 11:44:51	@PikFan	as in, the template's page
2014-07-19 11:45:18	@PikFan	I just thought it'd be interesting
2014-07-19 11:45:22	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 11:45:23	@PikFan	oh well, trial and error
2014-07-19 11:46:38	@PikFan	anyway, about other stuff
2014-07-19 11:47:02	@Espyo	mhm?
2014-07-19 11:47:09	@Espyo	Skype gave me the chatlog for when I was away
2014-07-19 11:47:27	@PikFan	so since we're going to have a real community soon, we should probably start making community pages
2014-07-19 11:48:32	@Espyo	hm, like what?
2014-07-19 11:48:55	@PikFan	this one isn't really a community page, but stood out nonetheless
2014-07-19 11:49:23	@PikFan	on the Main Page of Zelda Wiki, they've got that Helping Out box 
2014-07-19 11:49:33	@Espyo	yeah, on Smash Wiki too
2014-07-19 11:49:36	@Espyo	and it looks amazing and helpful
2014-07-19 11:50:04	@PikFan	the Editing box here in Pikipedia isn't as impacting
2014-07-19 11:50:20	@PikFan	and it's pushed down, so people can't really see it that great
2014-07-19 11:50:51	@PikFan	anyway, about some community pages
2014-07-19 11:51:07	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 11:51:09	@PikFan	we probably should have some sort of "central" page, with a link on the main page
2014-07-19 11:51:14	@Espyo	let me point ideas down
2014-07-19 11:51:18	@Espyo	yeah, agreed
2014-07-19 11:51:43	@PikFan	the central page will then link to various other pages, each having a unique aspect of the wiki
2014-07-19 11:51:56	@PikFan	we already have one: the forums
2014-07-19 11:52:00	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 11:52:05	@PikFan	also help pages
2014-07-19 11:52:31	@PikFan	some of the newer ones could be discussions about projects
2014-07-19 11:52:37	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 11:52:50	@Espyo	and stuff like voting for policies and FAs
2014-07-19 11:52:59	@PikFan	I don't really know what will come out in the end, but you get the idea
2014-07-19 11:53:11	@PikFan	more ideas will be fleshed out as time goes on
2014-07-19 11:53:37	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 11:53:43	@Espyo	we can take inspiration on the like of Bulbapedia
2014-07-19 11:54:03	@Espyo	I bet that the number of community pages Bulbapedia has is even larger than our number of pages
2014-07-19 11:54:09	@Espyo	our total number of pages
2014-07-19 11:54:34	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-19 11:54:45	@PikFan	uh-oh, I just realized a problem
2014-07-19 11:54:59	@PikFan	if we have discussion pages, they will make the forums irrelevant
2014-07-19 11:55:33	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-07-19 11:55:34	@Espyo	not really
2014-07-19 11:55:36	@PikFan	let's see... Zelda Wiki has only discussion pages
2014-07-19 11:55:37	@Espyo	we always used the forums
2014-07-19 11:55:40	@Espyo	and we always had discussion pages
2014-07-19 11:55:48	@Espyo	and we always worked it out
2014-07-19 11:55:50	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-19 11:56:02	@PikFan	well, again, we'll come up with something
2014-07-19 11:56:20	@PikFan	it's just that since we're going to have a community, we need stuff that can support it
2014-07-19 11:56:41	@PikFan	in my mind, Pikipedia is a humble, little town
2014-07-19 11:56:58	@PikFan	right now we're strive for quality
2014-07-19 11:57:00	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 11:57:07	@Espyo	we do our own little thing
2014-07-19 11:57:14	@Espyo	we don't want to be enclosed, but we kind of are
2014-07-19 11:57:16	@Espyo	but now, it's changed
2014-07-19 11:57:28	@PikFan	soon, we're going to get a bunch of immigrants, and our little town cannot support all these people
2014-07-19 11:57:28	@Espyo	the ideal is still there, but the execution changed dramatically
2014-07-19 11:57:30	@Espyo	hah
2014-07-19 11:57:46	@PikFan	as such, we need to construct the infrastructure able to support all of them
2014-07-19 11:58:01	@PikFan	Pikipedia is going to turn into a city soon
2014-07-19 11:58:04	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 11:58:11	@Espyo	I can already imagine the new Pikipedia...
2014-07-19 11:58:11	@PikFan	a bustling metropolis
2014-07-19 11:58:13	@Espyo	we waited long for this
2014-07-19 11:58:15	@Espyo	but it's finally here
2014-07-19 11:58:25	@PikFan	we're on the cusp of a major change
2014-07-19 11:58:39	@PikFan	one that will change the entire community
2014-07-19 11:58:56	@PikFan	not just the wikis, but YouTube, GameFAQs, and others
2014-07-19 12:00:07	@PikFan	we've still got the ToDo, right?
2014-07-19 12:00:31	@Espyo	we do
2014-07-19 12:00:37	@Espyo	let's not share 100% of the things yet
2014-07-19 12:00:41	@PikFan	right
2014-07-19 12:00:43	@Espyo	we never know if a tiny thing could make them not move
2014-07-19 12:00:48	@Espyo	and if that's the case and we have to go alone again
2014-07-19 12:00:54	@Espyo	let's not at least give them ideas on how to improve
2014-07-19 12:01:01	@Espyo	we can't really treat them as "them" any more
2014-07-19 12:01:12	@PikFan	unless they decide not to move
2014-07-19 12:01:12	@Espyo	so... *let's not give wikia users ideas to improve
2014-07-19 12:01:21	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 12:01:38	@PikFan	also, that ToDo is HUGE
2014-07-19 12:01:56	@PikFan	we should make a condensed ToDo, probably
2014-07-19 12:02:20	@PikFan	just for ease of mind
2014-07-19 12:02:21	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-19 12:02:26	@Espyo	it just looks huge
2014-07-19 12:02:30	@Espyo	but it's organized
2014-07-19 12:02:49	@PikFan	too bad it doesn't have a ToC, or it'd look less scary
2014-07-19 12:03:51	@PikFan	anyway
2014-07-19 12:04:06	@PikFan	last night jpmrocks said that they need to talk to Dave
2014-07-19 12:04:10	@Espyo	hm
2014-07-19 12:04:13	@Espyo	yeah, they do
2014-07-19 12:04:31	@PikFan	apparently he's their lead theorist
2014-07-19 12:04:52	@PikFan	which raises the questions of theories
2014-07-19 12:05:05	@PikFan	we have Pikmin Fanon, yes
2014-07-19 12:05:57	@PikFan	somehow I feel like theories explaining something canonical isn't exactly... uh
2014-07-19 12:06:16	@PikFan	well, I feel like they shouldn't be on Fanon, for some reason
2014-07-19 12:06:29	@PikFan	and by "theories", I mean well-developed theories
2014-07-19 12:06:37	@PikFan	not just one or two sentences
2014-07-19 12:06:51	@PikFan	those can go on Fanon
2014-07-19 12:07:13	@PikFan	thoughts?
2014-07-19 12:07:28	@Espyo	yeah, we can't have theories on Pikipedia
2014-07-19 12:07:36	@Espyo	they're not confirmed content
2014-07-19 12:07:41	@Espyo	we focus on the facts
2014-07-19 12:07:51	@Espyo	but we can, and easily should link to theories that are available
2014-07-19 12:07:56	@Espyo	specially if they're on the likes of Fanon
2014-07-19 12:08:02	@Espyo	so, I'm not sure how Fanon works internally
2014-07-19 12:08:05	@PikFan	right, but
2014-07-19 12:08:09	@Espyo	but maybe it should change from being a collection of game ideas
2014-07-19 12:08:13	@Espyo	to being anything fan-related
2014-07-19 12:08:14	@Espyo	including theories
2014-07-19 12:08:22	@PikFan	the lesser theories go on Fanon
2014-07-19 12:08:52	@PikFan	while the more developed ones go on Pikipedia, marked with a theory template or something, to show it's not canonical
2014-07-19 12:09:16	@PikFan	but...
2014-07-19 12:09:24	@PikFan	hmm, now I'm conflicted
2014-07-19 12:09:50	@PikFan	I want theories on Pikipedia because of ease of access, but don't because they aren't fully relevant
2014-07-19 12:10:06	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-07-19 12:10:15	@Espyo	well, Zelda Wiki does place them in-article
2014-07-19 12:10:30	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I'm basing this off of
2014-07-19 12:10:38	@Espyo	but if they're meant to be expansive, we may have to think about linking to fanon, and leaving only a small section that introduces it
2014-07-19 12:10:43	@Espyo	another thing is like
2014-07-19 12:10:47	@Espyo	in Zelda, the fanbase is huge
2014-07-19 12:10:53	@Espyo	loads of theorists do this day and night
2014-07-19 12:10:56	@Espyo	and well, afaik
2014-07-19 12:11:16	@Espyo	Dave is like a 12 year-old that just grabs one or two insane theories here and there
2014-07-19 12:11:21	@Espyo	no offense to you, of course
2014-07-19 12:11:52	@PikFan	(actually he's older, and his theories are interesting)
2014-07-19 12:11:57	@PikFan	but I get what you're saying
2014-07-19 12:12:21	@PikFan	actually, I like the idea of introducing it on Pikipedia, then linking to Fanon
2014-07-19 12:12:32	@Espyo	stuff like... I don't know, "Though fan theories state that Bulbmin may actually be a mutated form of humans that crash-landed on the Pikmin planet, served as leaders, but ultimately died and became human-Pikmin hybrids; these hybrids would eventually evolve into the parasitic Bulbmin."
2014-07-19 12:12:35	@Espyo	or some crazy thing like that
2014-07-19 12:12:43	@PikFan	lol no
2014-07-19 12:12:46	@PikFan	definitely not
2014-07-19 12:12:47	@Espyo	all right, good
2014-07-19 12:12:51	@Espyo	but we'd have to take it gently
2014-07-19 12:12:59	@Espyo	one of the things I'm scared of the most is giving them a lot of changes
2014-07-19 12:13:09	@Espyo	they're already coming to a place where they'll lose their comment-like talk-page system
2014-07-19 12:13:11	@Espyo	and achievements
2014-07-19 12:13:18	@PikFan	what kind of evidence shows that they were humans? crash-landing?
2014-07-19 12:13:26	@PikFan	there isn't
2014-07-19 12:13:27	@Espyo	and if on top of that, we add "please ALSO go on Fanon to discuss the theories kthx"
2014-07-19 12:13:33	@Espyo	I think they might not like so much change
2014-07-19 12:13:40	@Espyo	yeah, I know there isn't
2014-07-19 12:13:47	@PikFan	yeah, the change has to be gentle
2014-07-19 12:13:47	@Espyo	that's why that was an example of a stupid theory
2014-07-19 12:14:25	@PikFan	and also, there's the power of compromise
2014-07-19 12:14:56	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-07-19 12:15:15	@PikFan	we can use compromise
2014-07-19 12:15:19	@PikFan	can we not?
2014-07-19 12:15:42	@Espyo	like, what do you mean?
2014-07-19 12:15:50	@PikFan	like
2014-07-19 12:15:58	@PikFan	so about the talk-page system
2014-07-19 12:16:30	@PikFan	I remember you saying something about an add-on that could simulate the comments, or something
2014-07-19 12:16:48	@PikFan	if they don't like the talk page
2014-07-19 12:16:48	@Espyo	not sure
2014-07-19 12:16:53	@PikFan	or something
2014-07-19 12:17:12	@PikFan	but we just need to make sure to keep them here
2014-07-19 12:17:28	@PikFan	not let them get sucked back into wikia
2014-07-19 12:17:53	@PikFan	brb
2014-07-19 12:17:54	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 12:17:58	@Espyo	they wouldn't have a reason to
2014-07-19 12:18:05	@Espyo	getting them out is the hard part, and it's done
2014-07-19 12:19:50	@PikFan	back
2014-07-19 12:19:59	@PikFan	well, they're almost out
2014-07-19 12:20:04	@Espyo	yes
2014-07-19 12:20:14	@PikFan	still that chance
2014-07-19 12:20:30	@PikFan	that 0.00000000000000001% chance they want to stay
2014-07-19 12:23:24	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 12:33:32	@Espyo	oh, I'm not sure if I asked you this already
2014-07-19 12:33:38	@Espyo	but what does the business season do on CC?
2014-07-19 12:33:51	@PikFan	nothing gameplay-wise
2014-07-19 12:33:59	@PikFan	just aesthetics
2014-07-19 12:34:29	@Espyo	:|
2014-07-19 12:34:31	@PikFan	the buildings have different names and descriptions, and GCs are business contracts
2014-07-19 12:34:41	@Espyo	same for Valentine's, right?
2014-07-19 12:34:59	@PikFan	GCs are hearts
2014-07-19 12:35:08	@PikFan	and the Valentine cookies appear
2014-07-19 12:35:16	@PikFan	which cost what, 10 quad
2014-07-19 12:35:18	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2014-07-19 12:35:21	@Espyo	I remember those now
2014-07-19 12:35:26	@Espyo	Christmas, Easter, Valentine and Halloween are at least useful
2014-07-19 12:35:38	@Espyo	but why in the world would anybody waste their cookies on business
2014-07-19 12:35:48	@PikFan	well, business day did come out on April Fool's...
2014-07-19 12:36:14	@Espyo	hm, true...
2014-07-19 12:36:54	@PikFan	so I've got 180 prisms, and they are expensive
2014-07-19 12:37:03	@PikFan	next one costs 6.132 sex
2014-07-19 12:37:50	@Espyo	youch
2014-07-19 12:38:24	@PikFan	lolwut
2014-07-19 12:38:43	@PikFan	there's this ad on CC about "Microsoft Azure", whatever that is
2014-07-19 12:38:50	@Espyo	I've heard of it
2014-07-19 12:38:57	@PikFan	and it's got an icon of Cloud City from Star Wars
2014-07-19 12:38:59	@Espyo	dunno what it is, but it's probably stupid
2014-07-19 12:39:02	@Espyo	what
2014-07-19 12:39:13	@PikFan	with the description "Welcome to Cloud City. Sans Lando."
2014-07-19 12:39:42	@Espyo	uh...huh
2014-07-19 12:40:05	@Espyo	hm, I noticed another change on NPC!P
2014-07-19 12:40:14	@Espyo	the save game screen has different music
2014-07-19 12:40:15	@Espyo	slightly
2014-07-19 12:40:26	@PikFan	save game screen?
2014-07-19 12:40:31	@Espyo	there's like this "web web web web web web web..." at the start of the song
2014-07-19 12:40:50	@PikFan	you mean the end of day results screen?
2014-07-19 12:41:07	@Espyo	no, save game loading
2014-07-19 12:41:17	@PikFan	file select?
2014-07-19 12:41:36	@PikFan	Wii startup screen?
2014-07-19 12:42:11	@PikFan	not quite sure what you mean
2014-07-19 12:42:26	@PikFan	meh, maybe it's because I'm tired
2014-07-19 12:42:34	@PikFan	4:42 AM
2014-07-19 12:44:15	@PikFan	hmm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure
2014-07-19 12:44:35	@PikFan	Azure made me think of the cloud
2014-07-19 12:44:38	@Espyo	all right, gonna try the swim through gates glitch
2014-07-19 12:44:45	@Espyo	yeah, I think it's like a cloud service
2014-07-19 12:44:53	@Espyo	heh, when you start a new game from the main menu
2014-07-19 12:45:00	@Espyo	and you get to choose which file to play on
2014-07-19 12:45:05	@Espyo	[[Menu#Save game selection]]
2014-07-19 12:45:05	Testyo	"Menu#Save_game_selection" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Menu#Save_game_selection
2014-07-19 12:45:25	@PikFan	oh, so file select
2014-07-19 12:46:33	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-19 12:46:38	@Espyo	you sure it's easy?
2014-07-19 12:46:45	@Espyo	I threw the Pikmin over the other side
2014-07-19 12:46:53	@Espyo	it realized there's a gate, went to attack it
2014-07-19 12:46:55	@Espyo	and started drowning
2014-07-19 12:46:57	@Espyo	I then whistled
2014-07-19 12:47:01	@Espyo	and nothing, it got stuck on the gate
2014-07-19 12:47:12	@PikFan	bizzare
2014-07-19 12:47:22	@Espyo	do you have to whistle them the second they land?
2014-07-19 12:47:26	@PikFan	try it again, maybe it was a freak accident
2014-07-19 12:47:27	@Espyo	it kinda seemed like you meant that
2014-07-19 12:47:45	@PikFan	kinda...
2014-07-19 12:47:58	@PikFan	generally just whistle at them when they land
2014-07-19 12:48:19	@PikFan	I wish I had a capture device
2014-07-19 12:48:44	@Espyo	can't get it to work whatsoever
2014-07-19 12:48:48	@Espyo	this is NPC!
2014-07-19 12:48:54	@Espyo	so it might be easy on P1
2014-07-19 12:49:02	@Espyo	but it looks like it doesn't work on NPC
2014-07-19 12:49:06	@PikFan	wait, how do you have NPC!
2014-07-19 12:49:09	@Espyo	hacks
2014-07-19 12:49:13	@Espyo	illegally
2014-07-19 12:49:14	@PikFan	Dolphin—oh
2014-07-19 12:49:23	@PikFan	shh, NSA...
2014-07-19 12:49:24	@Espyo	I got the ISO to play on my Wii
2014-07-19 12:49:26	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-19 12:49:36	@Espyo	meh, they would've known anyway
2014-07-19 12:49:40	@Espyo	plus, I'm not playing it to enjoy it
2014-07-19 12:49:43	@Espyo	I'm playing it for science
2014-07-19 12:49:51	@Espyo	as for hacking my Wii, I HAD to
2014-07-19 12:49:53	@PikFan	well, you live in Portugal, so they can't touch you
2014-07-19 12:50:00	@Espyo	because my disk reader stopped reading disks long ago
2014-07-19 12:50:04	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-19 12:50:06	@Espyo	so my only chance to play games is like this
2014-07-19 12:50:13	@Espyo	PLUS, with WFC dying some months back
2014-07-19 12:50:19	@Espyo	the only way to play online is with hacks
2014-07-19 12:50:20	@Espyo	so...
2014-07-19 12:50:25	@Espyo	all right, gonna try GCN P
2014-07-19 12:50:54	@Espyo	if I can, if I have a save that has that gate up
2014-07-19 12:51:09	@PikFan	since your disk reader doesn't work (therefore you can't use Dolphin), you hacked?
2014-07-19 12:51:18	@PikFan	I see
2014-07-19 12:51:21	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 12:51:28	@Espyo	I use homebrew to run games from a usb drive
2014-07-19 12:51:37	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-19 12:54:35	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/6/65/Pikmin_2_options.jpg
2014-07-19 12:54:41	@PikFan	it has a language option
2014-07-19 12:55:02	@PikFan	this is the European version, right?
2014-07-19 12:56:41	@Espyo	this is EU GCN P2
2014-07-19 12:56:47	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-19 12:56:57	@PikFan	I'll add it to [[Region]] later
2014-07-19 12:56:57	Testyo	"Region" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Region
2014-07-19 12:57:08	@PikFan	I need to sleep
2014-07-19 12:57:14	@PikFan	almost 5
2014-07-19 12:57:22	@PikFan	night
2014-07-19 12:57:29	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@u-78-94-868-36.hsd6.or.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: sleep)
2014-07-19 12:57:54	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-19 12:58:41	@Espyo	Testyo: memo PikFan but [[Region]] already mentions the language selection
2014-07-19 12:58:42	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for PikFan saying: but [[Region]] already mentions the language selection.

2014-07-19 17:27:19	Jpmrocks	Hello
2014-07-19 17:27:38	@Espyo	hi
2014-07-19 17:27:52	Jpmrocks	I'm speaking with Wikia now
2014-07-19 17:28:00	@Espyo	you mean the wikia staff?
2014-07-19 17:28:09	Jpmrocks	I mean pikmin wikia
2014-07-19 17:28:14	@Espyo	oh, the members
2014-07-19 17:28:16	Jpmrocks	yeah
2014-07-19 17:28:25	Jpmrocks	When the info gets moved over
2014-07-19 17:28:34	Jpmrocks	how will preexisting pages work
2014-07-19 17:28:42	Jpmrocks	would they override old pages
2014-07-19 17:28:42	@Espyo	we'll have to cherry-pick them
2014-07-19 17:28:47	Jpmrocks	oh
2014-07-19 17:28:51	@Espyo	I think the import process would warn us
2014-07-19 17:28:56	Jpmrocks	ah ok
2014-07-19 17:28:57	@Espyo	for Pikmin 3 pages, they can be imported directly
2014-07-19 17:29:07	@Espyo	we have so few that it doesn't matter
2014-07-19 17:29:15	@Espyo	but elsewhere, we'll combine the best parts of each
2014-07-19 17:29:24	@Espyo	there are tools that can highlight the differences between two articles
2014-07-19 17:29:29	Jpmrocks	Oh my
2014-07-19 17:29:34	@Espyo	so we can easily see back-and-forth what parts of what article to keep
2014-07-19 17:29:35	Jpmrocks	this place is super fancy
2014-07-19 17:29:41	@Espyo	you mean the IRC?

2014-07-19 17:30:40	Jpmrocks	Hi Testyo, mr roboto
2014-07-19 17:30:40	@Espyo	reporting the changes
2014-07-19 17:30:49	@Espyo	the thing is, I made him silent on this channel

2014-07-19 17:30:59	@Espyo	I don't know, see if he wouldn't spam?
2014-07-19 17:31:04	@Espyo	and it stuck, so I never un-silenced him

2014-07-19 17:31:56	Jpmrocks	Testyo, are you a pretty princess?
2014-07-19 17:31:57	Testyo	he didn't realise one thing from yesterday
2014-07-19 17:32:04	Jpmrocks	:|
2014-07-19 17:32:11	@Espyo	hmm, thing from yesterday, Testyo?
2014-07-19 17:32:12	Testyo	if you want to link to the page, but want it to display other text, use a pool of chicken embyos
2014-07-19 17:32:20	@Espyo	oh...k
2014-07-19 17:32:47	@Espyo	he creates sentences using things we said
2014-07-19 17:32:47	Jpmrocks	Sounds like Deneverek, another guy in our skype
2014-07-19 17:32:56	@Espyo	I... don't remember us ever talking about chicken embryos, but whatever

2014-07-19 17:36:55	Jpmrocks	There's one thing I'm nervous about this transition from Wikia to here
2014-07-19 17:37:09	Jpmrocks	Well, everyone in Skype is nervous about
2014-07-19 17:38:08	Jpmrocks	We're a bit worried that when we move over
2014-07-19 17:38:23	Jpmrocks	that Pikmin Wikia will still spring back to life
2014-07-19 17:38:28	Jpmrocks	like what happened at first
2014-07-19 17:39:09	@Espyo	we'll have to make sure it won't happen
2014-07-19 17:39:28	@Espyo	the wikia sprung to life because there were members of the fanbase that didn't know about the move to Pikipedia
2014-07-19 17:39:33	@Espyo	except now, we'll make everybody know
2014-07-19 17:39:38	@Espyo	for one thing, your editors will
2014-07-19 17:39:52	@Espyo	and they make up 90+% of editors who edit Pikmin
2014-07-19 17:40:05	@Espyo	as for anybody new that comes along... we'll have to take precautions for that to not happen
2014-07-19 17:40:06	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User:RuddieTheRedBulborb by RuddieTheRedBulborb (+15 /* To Do List */ ) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User:RuddieTheRedBulborb&curid=8882&diff=44758&oldid=44757
2014-07-19 17:40:15	@Espyo	like, warn people everywhere that the move happened
2014-07-19 17:40:22	Jpmrocks	yeah
2014-07-19 17:40:31	@Espyo	plus, with more activity on Pikipedia, the higher it ranks on Google and the like
2014-07-19 17:40:32	Jpmrocks	so, this whole thingy of transferring onfi
2014-07-19 17:40:35	@J	oh, hi Jpmrocks 
2014-07-19 17:40:38	Jpmrocks	how long should it take
2014-07-19 17:40:40	Jpmrocks	Hi J
2014-07-19 17:40:45	@Espyo	uh, 3 days, I'm guessing
2014-07-19 17:40:47	@Espyo	worst case scenario
2014-07-19 17:40:50	Jpmrocks	ah ok
2014-07-19 17:40:54	@Espyo	importing the pages takes just about an hour
2014-07-19 17:40:54	@J	initial transfer, sure
2014-07-19 17:41:02	@Espyo	merging the pages could take us quite a few
2014-07-19 17:41:07	@J	but I expect it would take some time to get stuff merged properly
2014-07-19 17:41:13	@Espyo	but in the mean time, images and the like will also be transfered
2014-07-19 17:41:18	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 17:41:23	@J	and we probably need to edit all the new pages to normalise categories and templates
2014-07-19 17:41:29	@Espyo	for existing pages, I guess we'll have to do it by hand
2014-07-19 17:41:36	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 17:41:43	Jpmrocks	and thats something everyone can do?
2014-07-19 17:42:03	@J	what we can do is migrate everything with the same name to '<page>/merge' or something
2014-07-19 17:42:09	@J	to make it easier to see what's left
2014-07-19 17:42:16	Jpmrocks	oh ok
2014-07-19 17:42:28	@J	then people can mark those subpages for deletion as each merge is completed
2014-07-19 17:42:36	Jpmrocks	cause I don't want to have 24 peeps move over, and then can't help with the initial move
2014-07-19 17:42:37	@Espyo	and add {{game icons}} and the like
2014-07-19 17:42:37	Testyo	"game_icons" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game_icons
2014-07-19 17:42:58	@Espyo	anybody can help with the move
2014-07-19 17:43:05	Jpmrocks	ah ok
2014-07-19 17:43:08	@Espyo	like J said, the categorizations and such are easy
2014-07-19 17:43:13	@Espyo	heck, {{game icons}} requires no skill
2014-07-19 17:43:13	Testyo	"game_icons" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:game_icons
2014-07-19 17:43:17	@Espyo	you literally go through all new articles
2014-07-19 17:43:21	@Espyo	and add that template at the top
2014-07-19 17:43:27	@Espyo	with the corresponding games it applies to
2014-07-19 17:43:29	@Espyo	it's all
2014-07-19 17:43:34	Jpmrocks	wow
2014-07-19 17:43:34	@J	we might need some discussion on merging differences in policies
2014-07-19 17:43:36	@Espyo	categories should be fine the way they are, for the most part
2014-07-19 17:43:41	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 17:43:52	@Espyo	so before we merge, stuff like this should take place
2014-07-19 17:43:55	@J	I think we have changed some categories since we split
2014-07-19 17:43:59	@Espyo	decide on the policies and guidelines
2014-07-19 17:44:01	@Espyo	we did
2014-07-19 17:44:06	@Espyo	at least, we added
2014-07-19 17:44:19	@J	not sure when exactly it was that we made all articles have sentence-case titles
2014-07-19 17:44:39	@Espyo	I think it was post-split

2014-07-19 17:45:59	Jpmrocks	We also have chat policies for the wikis IRC thingy
2014-07-19 17:46:09	Jpmrocks	and Skype chat policies if you want to see those
2014-07-19 17:46:11	@Espyo	#1 isn't that much of a policy
2014-07-19 17:46:17	@Espyo	it is, but it's also like common sense
2014-07-19 17:46:22	@Espyo	sure
2014-07-19 17:46:28	@Espyo	the IRC policies aren't strict
2014-07-19 17:46:33	@Espyo	we just don't want people to harass one another
2014-07-19 17:46:34	@Espyo	that's all
2014-07-19 17:46:43	@Espyo	plus, no being annoying, no posting shocking content
2014-07-19 17:46:45	@Espyo	you know, the usual
2014-07-19 17:46:48	@J	yeah, most of those are respected at Pikipedia, but are unwritten because they should be common sense
2014-07-19 17:46:50	@Espyo	so we really don't have any special rules here
2014-07-19 17:46:54	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-19 17:46:56	@J	8 poses issues
2014-07-19 17:47:09	Jpmrocks	oh
2014-07-19 17:47:13	Jpmrocks	8 was made
2014-07-19 17:47:27	Jpmrocks	because with wikis, all those /louie or whatev pages
2014-07-19 17:47:27	@J	so, we originally had the notes within the articles
2014-07-19 17:47:34	Jpmrocks	added tons of cluttered
2014-07-19 17:47:40	Jpmrocks	and we manually added them onto the pages
2014-07-19 17:47:50	@Espyo	right, we solved that by moving it to the Notes: namespace
2014-07-19 17:47:54	@Espyo	so it stopped being clutter on the main space
2014-07-19 17:47:59	@Espyo	give it a try: [[Special:Random]]
2014-07-19 17:48:00	Testyo	"Special:Random" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:Random
2014-07-19 17:48:06	@J	at some point we split the mall out to make it clear that they're exact wording from the games, both to discourage rewording and for licensing purposes
2014-07-19 17:48:13	@Espyo	you will never find Olimar/Louie's notes, Sales Pitches or Olimar's Journal
2014-07-19 17:48:17	@J	after we split, you moved them back
2014-07-19 17:48:38	@J	and yeah, then we later moved to another namespace
2014-07-19 17:48:44	@Espyo	plus, it's convenient when you want an excerpt elsewhere
2014-07-19 17:48:49	@Espyo	like on the main page (random excerpts)
2014-07-19 17:49:00	Jpmrocks	oooo nice
2014-07-19 17:49:01	@Espyo	or an example on a page like [[Louie's Notes]]
2014-07-19 17:49:01	Testyo	"Louie's_Notes" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Louie's_Notes
2014-07-19 17:49:03	Jpmrocks	another perk of here
2014-07-19 17:49:54	@J	but it's still up for discussion
2014-07-19 17:50:03	@Espyo	mhm

2014-07-19 17:50:18	@Espyo	off-topic, but the Pikmin games call the Honeywisp "Qurione"
2014-07-19 17:50:22	@Espyo	which is romanized for a Clione
2014-07-19 17:50:25	@Espyo	this is a Clione http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Clione_limacina_by_NOAA.jpg
2014-07-19 17:50:31	@Espyo	worth mentioning?
2014-07-19 17:51:16	Jpmrocks	Possibly
2014-07-19 17:51:28	Jpmrocks	I wouldn't be bad
2014-07-19 17:51:32	Jpmrocks	to mention
2014-07-19 17:51:51	@Espyo	even if Honeywisps aren't Cliones, which they aren't
2014-07-19 17:51:55	@Espyo	the internal name still means that
2014-07-19 17:52:05	Jpmrocks	yeah
2014-07-19 17:52:09	@Espyo	and the fact that both are transparent is kind of a good pointer
2014-07-19 17:52:16	@Espyo	so at the very least, it's worth mentioning on Trivia
2014-07-19 17:52:16	Jpmrocks	they look similar
2014-07-19 17:52:24	Jpmrocks	id say to go for it
2014-07-19 17:53:01	@Espyo	is "romanization" the word I'm looking for?

2014-07-19 18:10:37	@J	hey, I was viewing it next to another window
2014-07-19 18:10:43	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-19 18:11:21	@J	not sure about the last line
2014-07-19 18:11:34	@J	if we have them hanging around, 'merge' is the wrong namespace for it
2014-07-19 18:11:41	@J	'archive' would make more sence
2014-07-19 18:11:45	@J	*sense
2014-07-19 18:11:46	@Espyo	not quite sure about the part where we leave merge pages for the history
2014-07-19 18:11:54	@Espyo	yeah, archive
2014-07-19 18:12:34	@J	'archive' doesn't make as much sense in the context of the merge, but if the edit adding the merge template also links to the other page, it doesn't matter
2014-07-19 18:12:58	@J	I mean, I'm assuming page history is important
2014-07-19 18:13:11	@Espyo	I'm not really following the "link to the other page" bit
2014-07-19 18:13:14	@J	I think we should preserve it where possible
2014-07-19 18:13:35	@Espyo	agreed
2014-07-19 18:13:56	@J	we have a 'Pikmin 2' page and an 'Archive: Pikmin 2' page; we make an edit to 'Pikmin 2' to add a template indicating it needs to be merged, and the template contains a link to 'Archive: Pikmin 2'
2014-07-19 18:14:48	@Espyo	uh-huh?
2014-07-19 18:15:13	@Espyo	then after we merge, probably manually...
2014-07-19 18:16:02	@Espyo	we remove the template and we keep the archive, because of the edit history
2014-07-19 18:16:05	@Espyo	but then what?
2014-07-19 18:16:08	@Espyo	will anything link to the archive?
2014-07-19 18:19:15	@J	the description for the edit that added the template links to it
2014-07-19 18:19:47	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-07-19 18:20:14	@J	I don't know if there's a way to merge page histories, but it would probably make it really confusing to navigate the history, no matter how you did it
2014-07-19 18:20:36	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-19 18:20:40	@Espyo	plus it would probably break stuff
2014-07-19 18:20:48	@Espyo	like one of us fixed a typo on Pikipedia
2014-07-19 18:20:55	@Espyo	and one of the wikians fixed it on wikia

2014-07-19 20:13:30	@J	hmm, instead of using images for those equations we could have got the Latex extension installed

2014-07-20 00:24:58	@PikFan	can you capture footage from a GameCube?
2014-07-20 00:25:11	@PikFan	like, make videos?
2014-07-20 00:25:18	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-20 00:25:20	@Espyo	emulator too
2014-07-20 00:25:23	@Espyo	so long as it's not slow
2014-07-20 00:25:27	@Espyo	I mean
2014-07-20 00:25:30	@Espyo	well, I'll explain soon
2014-07-20 00:25:49	@PikFan	don't you need a DVR or something
2014-07-20 00:26:08	@Espyo	nope, just this capture card
2014-07-20 00:26:18	@Espyo	it's a composite-to-usb thing
2014-07-20 00:26:21	@Espyo	I plug it on the laptop
2014-07-20 00:26:23	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-20 00:26:24	@Espyo	choose a program to handle it
2014-07-20 00:26:26	@Espyo	and I get the footage
2014-07-20 00:26:30	@Espyo	streamed directly
2014-07-20 00:26:31	@PikFan	aren't capture cards expensive though
2014-07-20 00:26:36	@Espyo	mine was pretty cheap
2014-07-20 00:26:38	@Espyo	 30€
2014-07-20 00:26:38	Testyo	30 € = £ 25.656  / $ 40.692 
2014-07-20 00:26:41	@Espyo	and the quality is decent
2014-07-20 00:26:46	@PikFan	relatively speaking
2014-07-20 00:27:04	@Espyo	good ones go for like double
2014-07-20 00:27:16	@Espyo	this one is half the regular price, but not half the quality
2014-07-20 00:27:28	@PikFan	I went looking for capture cards and I saw one that cost $250
2014-07-20 00:27:29	Testyo	$ 250 = 184.3 € / £ 157.625 
2014-07-20 00:27:46	@Espyo	wha-what?
2014-07-20 00:27:58	@PikFan	well, I just searched it
2014-07-20 00:28:38	@PikFan	er no, it was $150
2014-07-20 00:28:38	Testyo	$ 150 = 110.58 € / £ 94.575 
2014-07-20 00:28:40	@PikFan	still spendy
2014-07-20 00:29:16	@PikFan	agh, I wish we had more money...
2014-07-20 00:29:24	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-20 00:29:37	@PikFan	maybe I'll ask for a capture card for Christmas
2014-07-20 00:30:51	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-20 00:30:56	@Espyo	well, I can do the footage when I get P3
2014-07-20 00:30:59	@Espyo	so don't worry about that
2014-07-20 00:32:37	@PikFan	no, it's not that
2014-07-20 00:32:47	@PikFan	I want to take footage from P1/p2

2014-07-20 00:51:44	@Espyo	any in particular?
2014-07-20 00:51:46	@Espyo	I can take it too
2014-07-20 00:57:08	@PikFan	no
2014-07-20 00:57:17	@PikFan	only I would be able to take them
2014-07-20 00:57:25	@PikFan	e.g. my populations
2014-07-20 00:57:53	@PikFan	...or if you could somehow hack into the game and "recreate" my file
2014-07-20 00:58:20	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-20 00:58:22	@Espyo	use homebrew
2014-07-20 00:58:24	@PikFan	which would be near impossible, if not impossible to do
2014-07-20 00:58:48	@PikFan	well, it could be
2014-07-20 00:58:57	@PikFan	just set all the values to match that of my save
2014-07-20 00:59:01	@PikFan	*file
2014-07-20 00:59:30	@PikFan	what day, Pokos collected, Pikmin populations, sprays, enemies killed
2014-07-20 00:59:44	@PikFan	and Pikmin deaths
2014-07-20 00:59:58	@PikFan	oh, and play time
2014-07-20 01:00:25	@PikFan	oh, and I saw this video of how to play GCN games on the Wii U
2014-07-20 01:00:49	@PikFan	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_UcMNZEpe8
2014-07-20 01:03:57	@Espyo	oh, not quite what I meant, but
2014-07-20 01:04:03	@Espyo	with homebrew, you can export your save file
2014-07-20 01:04:05	@Espyo	I could import it here
2014-07-20 01:04:06	@Espyo	boom
2014-07-20 01:04:15	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-20 01:04:38	@PikFan	would the original file still be on the GameCube?
2014-07-20 01:05:27	@Espyo	hmm, that's interesting
2014-07-20 01:05:41	@Espyo	uh, no, it's saved on the memory card
2014-07-20 01:05:58	@PikFan	err yeah
2014-07-20 01:06:04	@PikFan	memory card
2014-07-20 01:06:22	@PikFan	*would the original file still be on the memory card?

2014-07-20 01:07:41	@PikFan	:|
2014-07-20 01:07:41	@Espyo	but I could export my save onto my PC as a backup
2014-07-20 01:07:44	@Espyo	replace it with yours
2014-07-20 01:07:47	@Espyo	then re-put it
2014-07-20 01:07:52	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-20 01:07:54	@Espyo	but it's just easier for you to get a capture card, really
2014-07-20 01:08:03	@Espyo	though if you want to invest so much in such a screenshot with your records...
2014-07-20 01:08:03	@PikFan	yeah, I agree
2014-07-20 01:08:05	@Espyo	it's really not wise
2014-07-20 01:08:22	@PikFan	well, I mean, I wouldn't use it ONLY for records
2014-07-20 01:08:46	@PikFan	I'd probably record a walkthrough or something
2014-07-20 01:09:04	@PikFan	like my 11-day run that I never finished
2014-07-20 01:09:24	@PikFan	still stuck at the Perplexing Pool
2014-07-20 01:09:26	@PikFan	and I

2014-07-20 01:09:29	@PikFan	know
2014-07-20 01:09:29	@PikFan	why
2014-07-20 01:10:06	@PikFan	I can do it, but I've never gotten around to it
2014-07-20 01:10:07	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-20 01:10:11	@Espyo	it's a big investment, though
2014-07-20 01:10:28	@PikFan	brb
2014-07-20 01:12:00	@PikFan	since my 3DS is broken, I can't take pictures of my populations anymore
2014-07-20 01:12:05	@PikFan	so I have to write them
2014-07-20 01:12:15	@PikFan	let's see...
2014-07-20 01:12:27	@PikFan	as of day 570, I have:
2014-07-20 01:12:34	@PikFan	16,031 Reds
2014-07-20 01:12:47	@PikFan	16,097 Yellows
2014-07-20 01:12:53	@PikFan	16,035 Blues
2014-07-20 01:12:55	@Espyo	wow
2014-07-20 01:13:02	@PikFan	1,210 Purples
2014-07-20 01:13:05	@PikFan	1,180 Whites
2014-07-20 01:13:19	@PikFan	altogether I have 50,553 Pikmin
2014-07-20 01:13:31	@PikFan	day 567 really paid off
2014-07-20 01:13:51	@PikFan	otherwise I wouldn't have 50,000 Pikmin right now
2014-07-20 01:14:28	@PikFan	let's see... I got what, somewhere around 1,300 Pikmin then?
2014-07-20 01:15:41	@PikFan	23:17:03: <PikFan> got 1,388 Pikmin
2014-07-20 01:15:46	@PikFan	ah
2014-07-20 01:17:18	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-20 01:17:25	@PikFan	that's what... 4 or 5 times what I normally get
2014-07-20 01:17:45	@PikFan	before Queen Candypops I'd get ~230
2014-07-20 01:17:54	@PikFan	with them now I get ~300\
2014-07-20 01:17:56	@PikFan	*-\

2014-07-20 13:11:40	@Espyo	you mean the AA?
2014-07-20 13:12:27	@J	no, that was your idea
2014-07-20 13:12:38	@J	er, I mean, my solution to the lack of AA
2014-07-20 13:13:03	@J	I said put shadows on the other side of the lines as well, but with a smaller radius
2014-07-20 13:13:13	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-20 13:13:14	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-07-20 13:13:17	@J	should be easy if you can already do it on one side
2014-07-20 13:13:20	@Espyo	I'll try a sketch, to see how that looks
2014-07-20 13:13:25	@Espyo	yeah, it's easy
2014-07-20 13:13:40	@Espyo	though the geometry itself is what's all aliased
2014-07-20 13:13:44	@J	I'm not saying it's guaranteed, but I would like to see how it looks
2014-07-20 13:13:48	@Espyo	and the shadows begin with a base transparency of... I don't know, 128?
2014-07-20 13:13:58	@Espyo	so you'd still see the jagged lines
2014-07-20 13:14:02	@J	yeah, but if the line is dark on both sides, you won't see it
2014-07-20 13:14:13	@Espyo	yeah, but 128 darkness might not be enough, is all
2014-07-20 13:14:16	@Espyo	still, worth a shot
2014-07-20 13:14:21	@J	well, play with the numbers

2014-07-20 14:39:48	@Espyo	I commented a bit
2014-07-20 14:39:52	@Espyo	mostly to try to understand it
2014-07-20 14:40:03	@Espyo	and yeah, if it's not a huge waste of space to keep pages just for the history
2014-07-20 14:40:09	@Espyo	but there really is no other way to do it...
2014-07-20 14:40:17	@Espyo	unless the history is kept on wikia and that's the end of that
2014-07-20 14:41:20	@Espyo	do we have the punch HP values for P1 and P2?

2014-07-20 14:42:34	@J	the text content of wikis are generally tiny
2014-07-20 14:42:39	@J	much smaller than you would expect, anyway
2014-07-20 14:42:47	@J	I think Wikipedia is only a few GiB
2014-07-20 14:43:12	@Espyo	yeah, it just looks big
2014-07-20 14:43:27	@Espyo	if, for instance, you try loading a Mega Drive ROM with a hex viewer
2014-07-20 14:43:31	@Espyo	and just scroll through everything
2014-07-20 14:43:36	@Espyo	you could almost fit all of our articles there
2014-07-20 14:43:39	@Espyo	and a ROM is only like 3 MB
2014-07-20 14:44:14	@J	hmm, we don't have a Bingo Battle article?
2014-07-20 14:44:20	@Espyo	apparently not
2014-07-20 14:44:25	@Espyo	unles... [[Bingo battle]]
2014-07-20 14:44:26	Testyo	"Bingo_battle" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bingo_battle
2014-07-20 14:44:27	@Espyo	*unless
2014-07-20 14:44:33	@Espyo	nope
2014-07-20 14:44:44	@Espyo	but then again, apparently wikis store a revision as an entire page
2014-07-20 14:45:06	@Espyo	which makes sense, otherwise it'd have to calculate all the diffs when you want to compare revisions
2014-07-20 14:45:19	@Espyo	maybe Porple has a better idea?
2014-07-20 14:45:34	@J	we'll have to ask for the namespace anyway
2014-07-20 14:45:56	@J	but yeah, even with all the revisions, it's small
2014-07-20 14:46:26	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-20 14:46:43	@Espyo	but I just have to wonder how pointless it all is or isn't

2014-07-20 14:47:22	@J	and making each revision separate means that on the backend, MW does an insert when it edits, rather than an update; and since it's probably using the TEXT SQL type for content, this avoids fragmentation
2014-07-20 14:48:10	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-20 14:48:15	@J	anyway, the rest makes sense?  And the ordering?
2014-07-20 14:48:27	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-20 14:48:52	@Espyo	to avoid imposters getting admin rights, all Pikmin Wiki admins must make an edit at Pikmin Wiki stating their Pikipedia account
2014-07-20 14:48:55	@Espyo	this one just seems silly
2014-07-20 14:49:04	@Espyo	unless they create their accounts manually
2014-07-20 14:49:08	@Espyo	I was thinking account import
2014-07-20 14:49:17	@Espyo	then again, not sure if that's a thing, and only the user pages can be imported
2014-07-20 14:49:20	@Espyo	in which case... forget it, I guess
2014-07-20 14:49:34	@Espyo	it'd be weird to suddenly see random edits on wikia with loose nicknames
2014-07-20 14:50:25	@Espyo	for talk pages:
2014-07-20 14:50:25	@Espyo	    if pikipedia version exists, link to other version
2014-07-20 14:50:32	@Espyo	silly Python syntax aside
2014-07-20 14:50:48	@Espyo	what did you mean by that?
2014-07-20 14:51:06	@Espyo	like, if they have a talk for Red Bulborb and so do we
2014-07-20 14:51:13	@Espyo	we just link to the imported archive on our talk page?
2014-07-20 14:51:30	@Espyo	would be better to manually merge, the edit history doesn't matter here
2014-07-20 14:54:00	@J	yeah, pretty much that
2014-07-20 14:54:11	@J	hmm, if you think it doesn't matter, I think we could merge
2014-07-20 14:54:31	@J	could be automatic too - just copy to the bottom, adding a ---- if there's no heading
2014-07-20 14:55:01	@J	yeah, you can't import accounts
2014-07-20 14:55:24	@J	not without source wiki db access, anyway
2014-07-20 14:56:04	@J	...I wasn't going for any sort of syntax
2014-07-20 14:57:28	@Espyo	lies
2014-07-20 14:57:40	@Espyo	you obviously wrote if, followed by a condition, and a colon
2014-07-20 14:57:44	@Espyo	and then indented the then and else

2014-07-20 15:08:04	@Espyo	(spoilers and all)
2014-07-20 15:08:07	@Espyo	incredibly idiotic claims?
2014-07-20 15:08:18	@PikFan	claiming they were Grey and Pink Pikmin
2014-07-20 15:08:25	@Espyo	what
2014-07-20 15:08:41	@PikFan	of course, I undid them as soon as I saw them
2014-07-20 15:08:44	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-20 15:08:45	@PikFan	I was disgusted
2014-07-20 15:09:13	@Espyo	he's clearly brain damaged
2014-07-20 15:09:14	@Espyo	or a troll
2014-07-20 15:09:20	@PikFan	or both
2014-07-20 15:09:23	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-20 15:09:56	@PikFan	well, tbh, I think Winged Pikmin might also be known as "Pink Pikmin" among the players
2014-07-20 15:10:01	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-20 15:10:04	@Espyo	but that's not the canon name
2014-07-20 15:10:09	@Espyo	and Grey is just way off
2014-07-20 15:10:13	@PikFan	but I've never heard of Grey Pikmin
2014-07-20 15:10:20	@Espyo	weird that you used "grey", though
2014-07-20 15:10:23	@Espyo	or are you quoting him?
2014-07-20 15:10:27	@Espyo	because Americans use "gray"
2014-07-20 15:10:29	@PikFan	quoting
2014-07-20 15:10:33	@PikFan	well
2014-07-20 15:10:37	@PikFan	dunno
2014-07-20 15:10:41	@PikFan	I'll check
2014-07-20 15:10:53	@PikFan	grey, gray, I'm so lost
2014-07-20 15:10:57	@Espyo	it's easy
2014-07-20 15:11:00	@Espyo	the trick is mind-blowing
2014-07-20 15:11:03	@Espyo	gray = America
2014-07-20 15:11:06	@Espyo	grey = England
2014-07-20 15:11:09	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-20 15:11:14	@Espyo	grAy = America
2014-07-20 15:11:14	@PikFan	I get it
2014-07-20 15:11:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-20 15:11:52	@PikFan	yeah, it was Gray Pikmin

2014-07-20 15:12:26	@Espyo	hehehe
2014-07-20 15:12:44	@PikFan	it's a shame Nintendo didn't do online play for P3
2014-07-20 15:12:50	@Espyo	err, that article quality
2014-07-20 15:12:52	@PikFan	maybe they'll enable it in a future update
2014-07-20 15:13:15	@PikFan	yeah, quality isn't optimal
2014-07-20 15:13:19	@PikFan	better than nothing though
2014-07-20 15:13:33	@PikFan	besides, it'll be replaced soon
2014-07-20 15:13:45	@PikFan	when do we start getting pages in?
2014-07-20 15:14:02	@PikFan	according to the log, they wanted to start by the 1st
2014-07-20 15:14:02	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-07-20 15:14:47	@PikFan	it's just amazing
2014-07-20 15:14:54	@PikFan	this impossible dream, actually happening
2014-07-20 15:15:08	@PikFan	it's beyond amazing

2014-07-20 15:16:23	@PikFan	Onion has been up way too long
2014-07-20 15:16:40	@PikFan	we need to go ahead and decide on the new FA
2014-07-20 15:16:48	@PikFan	what was the candidate again?

2014-07-20 15:23:34	@Espyo	adding online's a big change
2014-07-20 15:23:38	@Espyo	I don't think an update would cut it
2014-07-20 15:23:42	@Espyo	updates are such tiny things
2014-07-20 15:23:49	@Espyo	then again, they did add the alternate controls
2014-07-20 15:23:55	@Espyo	but those aren't such a big change as online
2014-07-20 15:23:55	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-20 15:23:59	@Espyo	plus online'd require servers
2014-07-20 15:24:05	@Espyo	I thought about implementing online for the engine
2014-07-20 15:24:11	@Espyo	and... honestly, I'm not sure how easy or hard it'd be
2014-07-20 15:24:18	@Espyo	on one hand, Testyo is both a client and a server
2014-07-20 15:24:23	@Espyo	he's a client in that he connects to DarkMyst
2014-07-20 15:24:36	@Espyo	and he's a server in that he has an HTTP server from which you can fetch pages
2014-07-20 15:24:37	@Espyo	Testyo: server
2014-07-20 15:24:37	Testyo	Here's the link to my instance on the server: http://89.152.247.250:8080/Pikipedia
2014-07-20 15:24:45	@Espyo	so maybe it's easy
2014-07-20 15:25:04	@Espyo	on the other hand, it's freaking online
2014-07-20 15:25:10	@Espyo	it's hell, it's just hell to implement
2014-07-20 15:25:31	@Espyo	languages being pointless for carrying?
2014-07-20 15:25:33	@Espyo	'course it's pointless
2014-07-20 15:25:37	@Espyo	but it's for completion's sake
2014-07-20 15:25:49	@Espyo	it's also pointless to mention that it's a mechanic in which Pikmin carry things
2014-07-20 15:25:52	@Espyo	yet it's the opening paragrahp
2014-07-20 15:25:57	@Espyo	*paragraph
2014-07-20 15:26:09	@Espyo	not quite the same, but the thing is, the alt languages aren't really in the way or anything
2014-07-20 15:26:12	@Espyo	so *shrug*
2014-07-20 15:26:20	@Espyo	Oversights could use {{main}}, yeah

2014-07-20 16:26:30	@Espyo	is this any good for an opening sentence?
2014-07-20 16:26:32	@Espyo	>The '''camera''' is the name given to the point in the world from which the player can view the action.
2014-07-20 16:26:39	@Espyo	uh, maybe remove the "The"
2014-07-20 16:29:24	@PikFan	going by that it sounds like you'd want to call it the viewpoint
2014-07-20 16:29:33	@PikFan	other than that it sounds fine
2014-07-20 16:30:55	@Espyo	yeah, I did want to use that word
2014-07-20 16:30:58	@Espyo	but I couldn't find a way how
2014-07-20 16:31:03	@Espyo	"A camera is a viewpoint"
2014-07-20 16:31:06	@Espyo	that's... really dumb

2014-07-20 16:39:06	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-20 16:39:08	@PikFan	like, the starting point for the captains is literally in front of Orange Bulborbs
2014-07-20 16:39:10	@Espyo	I never really had trouble with them
2014-07-20 16:39:13	@Espyo	ouch
2014-07-20 16:39:33	@PikFan	well yeah, because Purples in P2
2014-07-20 16:39:46	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-20 16:39:51	@PikFan	but Purples don't come to the rescue in P3
2014-07-20 16:39:58	@PikFan	they can't stun in P3
2014-07-20 16:40:13	@Espyo	:/
2014-07-20 16:40:18	@PikFan	they don't home in on enemies, either
2014-07-20 16:40:18	@Espyo	what can they do? just carry 10?
2014-07-20 16:40:25	@PikFan	pretty much
2014-07-20 16:40:37	@Espyo	but is their butt stomp at least strong?
2014-07-20 16:40:48	@Espyo	because most of the time, what does an enemy in is the sheer brutality of throwing them
2014-07-20 16:41:18	@PikFan	well...
2014-07-20 16:41:42	@PikFan	when you throw a Purple Pikmin at an enemy, it doesn't home in
2014-07-20 16:41:45	@Espyo	like an Emperor Bulblax
2014-07-20 16:41:49	@Espyo	it gets killed before even reacting
2014-07-20 16:41:52	@Espyo	doesn't need to be stunned
2014-07-20 16:42:05	@PikFan	even if you throw it right on top of the enemy, it doesn't latch on, strangely enough
2014-07-20 16:42:10	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-20 16:44:42	@PikFan	yep, they don't latch on
2014-07-20 16:44:53	@PikFan	tested it with a Spotty Bulbear
2014-07-20 16:45:18	@Espyo	but do they cause big damage on landing?
2014-07-20 16:45:22	@PikFan	nope
2014-07-20 16:45:23	@PikFan	nothing
2014-07-20 16:45:26	@Espyo	...
2014-07-20 16:45:29	@PikFan	all they do is fall off
2014-07-20 16:45:34	@Espyo	I agree that they were overpowered
2014-07-20 16:45:37	@Espyo	but now they're underpowered
2014-07-20 16:45:45	@Espyo	and that's exactly what's going to happen with Meta Knight in Smash 4
2014-07-20 16:45:47	@PikFan	then try to attack the enemy unless you call them back
2014-07-20 16:45:48	@Espyo	I've been saying this for months
2014-07-20 16:45:54	@Espyo	but Meta Knight is returning in Smash 4 from Brawl
2014-07-20 16:45:57	@PikFan	yeah, severely
2014-07-20 16:45:58	@Espyo	and whereas in Brawl he was unstoppable
2014-07-20 16:46:03	@Espyo	now he's going to be the worst character in the game
2014-07-20 16:46:09	@Espyo	because Nintendo can't do balance
2014-07-20 17:06:43	@PikFan	so about the menus
2014-07-20 17:07:20	@PikFan	you know how in Challenge Mode, you just choose the level you want and play it?
2014-07-20 17:07:40	@PikFan	in P3, in Mission Mode, you have to go through 3 menus before playing a level
2014-07-20 17:07:52	@PikFan	I should describe these, right?
2014-07-20 17:08:10	@PikFan	I mean, in the article
2014-07-20 17:08:33	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-20 17:08:49	@Espyo	you can group them all in a single section, if you think that there's not enough info for each page
2014-07-20 17:09:05	@PikFan	okay
2014-07-20 17:09:14	@PikFan	another thing
2014-07-20 17:09:32	@PikFan	on the day selection screen, there are two bubbles to the lower right
2014-07-20 17:10:02	@PikFan	one of them shows the top 5 playthroughs
2014-07-20 17:10:26	@PikFan	so basically the equivalent of high scores
2014-07-20 17:10:40	@PikFan	the other bubble shows rankings
2014-07-20 17:10:52	@PikFan	that is, global rankings
2014-07-20 17:11:08	@Espyo	global as in from all players in the world?
2014-07-20 17:11:11	@PikFan	yep
2014-07-20 17:11:17	@Espyo	wow
2014-07-20 17:11:24	@Espyo	well, you can link the first one to #High scores
2014-07-20 17:11:29	@Espyo	but the second should have its own section
2014-07-20 17:13:39	@PikFan	yeah, I'm taking some screenshots, so you can understand better

2014-07-20 17:15:11	@PikFan	I'll upload these onto Pikipedia when I've got all the menus down
2014-07-20 17:16:47	@Espyo	neat
2014-07-20 17:17:19	@Espyo	when you add them to the wiki, also point down that these are the scores since today
2014-07-20 17:17:32	@Espyo	or from today
2014-07-20 17:17:35	@Espyo	gah, there's a term...
2014-07-20 17:17:37	@Espyo	as per today?
2014-07-20 17:18:01	@PikFan	as of today

2014-07-20 17:23:18	@PikFan	to be honest I thought you'd say Europe
2014-07-20 17:23:22	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-20 17:23:25	@Espyo	could work too, really
2014-07-20 17:23:33	@Espyo	though, you know, there is no "European" language
2014-07-20 17:23:34	@Espyo	so...
2014-07-20 17:23:39	@PikFan	true
2014-07-20 17:23:59	@PikFan	does the EU have official languages?
2014-07-20 17:24:23	@Espyo	nope
2014-07-20 17:24:28	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-20 17:24:35	@Espyo	not afaik
2014-07-20 17:24:58	@PikFan	oh, it does
2014-07-20 17:25:03	@PikFan	it has 24 official languages
2014-07-20 17:25:13	@PikFan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union
2014-07-20 17:25:55	@Espyo	well, but none of them are the official one
2014-07-20 17:26:04	@Espyo	they're just the languages the countries within use
2014-07-20 17:26:17	@Espyo	listen, at one point I asked you if you could, in NPC!P2, whistle Pikmin from the other side of the area
2014-07-20 17:26:26	@Espyo	you said yes, and even said that they immediately become idle when it stops
2014-07-20 17:26:29	@Espyo	where did you test?
2014-07-20 17:26:41	@Espyo	I'm trying here and I can't get any good point where I can whistle Pikmin from across the map
2014-07-20 17:26:48	@Espyo	I mean, I can whistle some Pikmin from half the area away
2014-07-20 17:26:52	@Espyo	but I wanted the full span of the area
2014-07-20 17:26:55	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-20 17:27:08	@Espyo	tried the egg ledge on VoR to the entrance to the cave on the other end
2014-07-20 17:27:12	@PikFan	well, you can in /theory/ whistle from the other side of the area
2014-07-20 17:27:15	@Espyo	tried starting area of PP to the Submerged Castle
2014-07-20 17:27:25	@Espyo	tried those TIS trunks on WW to the starting base
2014-07-20 17:27:30	@Espyo	but I just can't get them
2014-07-20 17:27:33	@Espyo	I'll try closer, I guess
2014-07-20 17:27:41	@Espyo	I just wanted to add an extreme example to [[Camera]]

2014-07-20 17:27:54	@PikFan	wait, are you whistling at Pikmin from extreme distances?
2014-07-20 17:28:56	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-20 17:29:02	@Espyo	using the down-on-the-ground camera
2014-07-20 17:29:09	@PikFan	right
2014-07-20 17:35:55	@Espyo	ok, got it
2014-07-20 17:36:01	@Espyo	you can whistle from far away, yeah
2014-07-20 17:36:07	@Espyo	and the Pikmin do what you said
2014-07-20 17:36:12	@Espyo	but the other leader keeps going
2014-07-20 17:36:50	@PikFan	oh, really?
2014-07-20 17:36:59	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-20 17:37:08	@PikFan	well, it's a leader, so...
2014-07-20 17:39:00	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-20 17:40:23	@Espyo	well, I think I covered everything about the camera
2014-07-20 17:40:30	@Espyo	all there is to it is the controls
2014-07-20 17:40:33	@Espyo	got any more info?
2014-07-20 17:41:03	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-07-20 17:41:34	@PikFan	working on taking screenshots of menus
2014-07-20 17:43:44	@Espyo	I'd add it to [[HUD]], but...

2014-07-20 17:43:49	@Espyo	it's not really a hud element
2014-07-20 17:44:09	@Espyo	but it's so small to have its own article
2014-07-20 17:44:12	@PikFan	?
2014-07-20 17:44:19	@PikFan	camera?
2014-07-20 17:44:21	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-20 17:44:28	@PikFan	ah
2014-07-20 17:44:36	@Espyo	then again, we have some small articles
2014-07-20 17:46:19	@Espyo	I'll search around the wiki to see where the camera is mentioned
2014-07-20 17:46:23	@Espyo	to see if there's any info left
2014-07-20 18:01:46	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-20 18:02:01	@PikFan	there's a bunch of exploration notes about controls
2014-07-20 18:02:11	@PikFan	like... 28
2014-07-20 18:02:31	@Espyo	wow
2014-07-20 18:03:21	@PikFan	but in this sense, "controls" are more general
2014-07-20 18:03:27	@PikFan	than just like buttons
2014-07-20 18:09:35	@Espyo	but they are just buttons
2014-07-20 18:12:02	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-20 18:12:13	@PikFan	also, any news?

2014-07-20 21:59:56	@PikFan	you can make it
2014-07-20 22:00:07	ZoltCat	oh, It has Okami themes and characters and idk if i am allowed to do that  
2014-07-20 22:00:10	@PikFan	there isn't any policy against it, I think
2014-07-20 22:00:28	@PikFan	just as long as it has the main features of Pikmin games
2014-07-20 22:00:31	@PikFan	does it?
2014-07-20 22:00:55	ZoltCat	oh, ok. am i allowed to change what Alph is?
2014-07-20 22:01:05	@PikFan	I don't care

2014-07-20 22:01:32	@Espyo	all your game has to be is related to Pikmin
2014-07-20 22:01:46	@Espyo	other than that, you could make a game where Mario has the power to spawn Pikmin out of his hand
2014-07-20 22:01:52	@Espyo	it's... a bit bizarre, but it's your game
2014-07-20 22:01:59	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-20 22:02:38	ZoltCat	...i just want to make a game where Alph is half Okami (aka mortal gods)
2014-07-20 22:02:50	@PikFan	that's fine
2014-07-20 22:02:50	@Espyo	that's fine enough
2014-07-20 22:03:33	ZoltCat	but Okami are from another game and there will be bosses from Okami and stuff, 
2014-07-20 22:03:48	@Espyo	it's fine
2014-07-20 22:04:02	@PikFan	it's alright
2014-07-20 22:04:14	@PikFan	as long as it has, you know, Pikmin in it
2014-07-20 22:05:41	ZoltCat	ok, i was confused. And It WILL have pikmin in it, i have ideas. But im going to make another game before that one, i love Okami, but i never beat it... well, more studying for me.

2014-07-21 02:23:39	TPMHiatus	But I don't think 'part' is the right word
2014-07-21 02:23:52	ZoltCat	P.O.V
2014-07-21 02:23:56	TPMHiatus	And it's not POV, so I don't know what the call it
