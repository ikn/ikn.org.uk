2015-10-29 04:38:57	En_Passant	It would kind of ruin the idea of them being universal
2015-10-29 04:39:04	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-29 04:39:08	En_Passant	Especially since the Rolyant nest is a cave in the first region
2015-10-29 04:39:16	ScruffyChat	Oh neat
2015-10-29 04:39:22	En_Passant	So having another one would be weird
2015-10-29 04:39:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 04:41:09	ScruffyChat	Well I doubt one Rolyant would even be worth 1 Pikmin seed
2015-10-29 04:41:23	ScruffyChat	So I'm trying to think of another use for them once defeated
2015-10-29 04:42:59	En_Passant	I don't see why they wouldn't
2015-10-29 04:43:08	En_Passant	Shearwigs are worth 3 and they're pretty small
2015-10-29 04:43:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 04:43:41	En_Passant	4 in canon games, even
2015-10-29 04:44:27	ScruffyChat	I suppose that's alright then, now that I think about ti
2015-10-29 04:44:30	ScruffyChat	it*
2015-10-29 04:44:47	ScruffyChat	So they'd just roll around then
2015-10-29 04:47:06	ScruffyChat	and knock Pikmin over
2015-10-29 04:50:58	En_Passant	Kind of a let down for being the focus of the cave

2015-10-29 04:53:17	ScruffyChat	Sorry about that, my WiFi was being finicky
2015-10-29 04:54:11	En_Passant	Happens sometimes
2015-10-29 04:54:47	ScruffyChat	I might have missed something you said about the Ballistic Rolyant
2015-10-29 04:55:15	En_Passant	I didn't say anything about it
2015-10-29 04:55:41	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-29 04:55:54	En_Passant	I was talking about the Lowlies
2015-10-29 04:56:13	En_Passant	They're going to be the only enemy in the whole cave outside of the boss
2015-10-29 04:56:23	En_Passant	They should probably be more than a minor nuisance
2015-10-29 04:56:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 04:56:41	ScruffyChat	Perhaps enough of them can mass together and form shapes
2015-10-29 04:56:51	En_Passant	Nah
2015-10-29 04:57:03	ScruffyChat	I recently saw an article and video showing that ants act like a solid when pack together
2015-10-29 04:57:13	ScruffyChat	with the consistency of ketchup, of all things
2015-10-29 04:59:15	ScruffyChat	If a penny is dropped into a slot containing a large group of ants, the ants will distribute its weight and slow its fall so it doesn't crush any one ant
2015-10-29 04:59:33	ScruffyChat	And apparently this is giving scientists ideas about self-healing materials
2015-10-29 04:59:53	ScruffyChat	But anyway, Rolyants are not exactly ants
2015-10-29 05:00:06	ScruffyChat	And there would be too many to fight in such a situation
2015-10-29 05:14:16	ScruffyChat	Ok, just updated the PF page
2015-10-29 05:15:23	ScruffyChat	I have to get going, I think I'll be on tomorrow though
2015-10-29 05:15:27	En_Passant	Okay
2015-10-29 05:15:37	En_Passant	I'm currently counting the enemies in my areas
2015-10-29 05:15:52	En_Passant	I was hoping to analyze them with you, but I guess it can wait
2015-10-29 05:16:05	ScruffyChat	Well, I can spare a few minutes
2015-10-29 05:16:11	ScruffyChat	I'll just be right back
2015-10-29 05:16:33	ScruffyChat	You know what, I can spare more than a few minutes
2015-10-29 05:18:16	En_Passant	You don't have to
2015-10-29 05:18:20	En_Passant	It's 1AM there
2015-10-29 05:18:36	ScruffyChat	I've done later
2015-10-29 05:18:55	ScruffyChat	And I don't know if I'll be on all that much tomorrow or Saturday
2015-10-29 05:19:08	ScruffyChat	wait tomorrow is Thursday, never mind
2015-10-29 05:19:17	ScruffyChat	or, today is Thursday
2015-10-29 05:20:01	ScruffyChat	Yeah, this might be the only time i can be on until late today
2015-10-29 05:21:05	ScruffyChat	And I'm looking forward to your enemy ideas, they're very creative so far
2015-10-29 05:21:22	En_Passant	I don't have much
2015-10-29 05:22:26	En_Passant	There's the Vortexal Slugsack, a relative of the Meerslug that creates sandpits like any other antlion knockoff
2015-10-29 05:22:50	En_Passant	Ravenous Whiskerpillars can turn into a pupa which is the Burgeoning Spiderwort mold
2015-10-29 05:23:37	En_Passant	Those than metamorphose into a moth that eats useful plants
2015-10-29 05:24:23	En_Passant	And lastly, there's the the Sprightly Munchirp, which leaps around Silent Woods and eats Pikmin
2015-10-29 05:24:28	En_Passant	That's all I have
2015-10-29 05:24:35	ScruffyChat	I love the names
2015-10-29 05:24:39	En_Passant	Thanks
2015-10-29 05:24:56	En_Passant	Oh, wait, I also have a boss
2015-10-29 05:24:57	ScruffyChat	Any idea what the Munchirp would look like?
2015-10-29 05:25:08	En_Passant	It's a relative of the Antenna Beetle
2015-10-29 05:25:14	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-29 05:25:19	ScruffyChat	Right, hence the leaping
2015-10-29 05:25:23	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-10-29 05:25:30	En_Passant	I've renamed them to Antenna Sprickets
2015-10-29 05:25:36	En_Passant	Because they're not really beetles at all
2015-10-29 05:25:42	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-29 05:26:26	ScruffyChat	I have it too but I renamed it Antenna Pealbug
2015-10-29 05:26:32	En_Passant	Oh
2015-10-29 05:26:34	En_Passant	Interesting
2015-10-29 05:26:53	En_Passant	Oh, here's another enemy I forgot about
2015-10-29 05:27:03	En_Passant	Speaking of interesting, it's the Pellet Poser
2015-10-29 05:27:10	En_Passant	We separately came up with the same idea
2015-10-29 05:27:16	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-10-29 05:27:50	ScruffyChat	Wait, even the same name?
2015-10-29 05:28:06	En_Passant	Yes
2015-10-29 05:28:20	ScruffyChat	Wow, I guess we're just both that clever
2015-10-29 05:28:25	En_Passant	I'm assuming yours is a Creeping Chrysanthemum relative as well
2015-10-29 05:28:29	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-29 05:28:50	ScruffyChat	Although I've also imagined it resembling a miniature Quaggled Mireclops
2015-10-29 05:29:04	ScruffyChat	I don't know how I want it to look yet though
2015-10-29 05:29:16	En_Passant	I have a vague idea
2015-10-29 05:29:26	En_Passant	The pellet will be a 1 pellet and it will be the eye
2015-10-29 05:29:28	En_Passant	That's about it
2015-10-29 05:29:34	ScruffyChat	Ah, neat
2015-10-29 05:29:55	ScruffyChat	I think the indication for me would be that the pellet isn't translucent
2015-10-29 05:30:36	En_Passant	Actually, that reminded me of something I wanted to say about your Piklopedia
2015-10-29 05:31:09	En_Passant	What's up with the returning enemies you grouped together in families?
2015-10-29 05:31:36	En_Passant	Somehow, a fish, a cephalopod, and an insect are closely related
2015-10-29 05:32:11	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah, I intended to get back to that, actually
2015-10-29 05:32:24	ScruffyChat	But I didn't want to have too many families
2015-10-29 05:32:43	ScruffyChat	Though at the end of the day it doesn't matter, it's just text that shows up in olimar's notes
2015-10-29 05:33:53	ScruffyChat	I'll get around to fixing those eventually
2015-10-29 05:34:06	En_Passant	It's more than that to me, but I think it's something we'll have to agree to disagree on
2015-10-29 05:34:35	ScruffyChat	No I agree, it's means more than text to me as well
2015-10-29 05:34:45	ScruffyChat	I'm just stating what it would be at face value
2015-10-29 05:34:57	ScruffyChat	I think there's a lot of merit and a lot of charm to Olimar's notes
2015-10-29 05:35:19	ScruffyChat	which is why I'm trying to be really scientific writing his notes about the new enemies
2015-10-29 05:35:37	En_Passant	I actually have Brittany doing that
2015-10-29 05:35:57	En_Passant	Olimar writes his owns notes which are strategic
2015-10-29 05:36:02	ScruffyChat	Leveled up from botanist to biologist, I see
2015-10-29 05:36:09	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-10-29 05:36:17	En_Passant	That's most of the reason she's even returning
2015-10-29 05:37:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 05:38:27	ScruffyChat	Well
2015-10-29 05:39:27	ScruffyChat	When I wrote the piklopedia, I wanted to keep the number of families to a minimum so I might have an easier time of organizing them or maybe it wouldn't be as confusing
2015-10-29 05:39:50	ScruffyChat	But that's not the case in the real world, and you're right, it doesn't have to be the case here
2015-10-29 05:40:05	ScruffyChat	Especially when it doesn't make sense to pair up some animals like this
2015-10-29 05:40:39	En_Passant	I classify them by a higher part of the taxonomy tree than family
2015-10-29 05:41:12	En_Passant	I can't say which one because it's more about common concepts than being strictly accurate
2015-10-29 05:44:18	En_Passant	But I have it done by Grub-dogs (mammals?) + Breadbugs, mammals, insects, other arthropods, amphibians, misc. animals, plants, fungi
2015-10-29 05:44:48	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-29 05:45:17	En_Passant	At least, the general ideas
2015-10-29 05:45:50	En_Passant	Swooping Snitchbugs have no legs so technically they're not insects, but they're similar to bees which are
2015-10-29 05:46:29	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-10-29 05:46:58	ScruffyChat	So you go off of physical appearance mostly, and stay broad in your categories?
2015-10-29 05:47:08	En_Passant	Yes
2015-10-29 05:47:55	ScruffyChat	I ought to do something to that effect as well
2015-10-29 05:48:13	ScruffyChat	The way I'm going there will be a majority of one-enemy families
2015-10-29 05:49:13	En_Passant	I don't see anything wrong with that
2015-10-29 05:49:33	En_Passant	Pikmin 3 had only one enemy that was directly related to a previous one
2015-10-29 05:49:43	En_Passant	*new enemy
2015-10-29 05:49:57	En_Passant	Actually, two
2015-10-29 05:50:01	ScruffyChat	Which was... the Whiptongue?
2015-10-29 05:50:05	En_Passant	Three
2015-10-29 05:50:13	En_Passant	I was thinking of the Bug-Eyed Crawmad
2015-10-29 05:50:19	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-29 05:50:24	En_Passant	And then the Shaggy Long Legs popped into my head
2015-10-29 05:50:36	En_Passant	So basically, I need to think before I say things
2015-10-29 05:50:48	ScruffyChat	Heh, it's ok
2015-10-29 05:51:17	ScruffyChat	It's not like I judge anyway, but especially not at 1:50 AM
2015-10-29 05:52:52	En_Passant	So there are 3 that are directly related and a few that are theoretically related
2015-10-29 05:53:31	En_Passant	Wait, damn, four. Arctic Cannon Larva
2015-10-29 05:53:38	ScruffyChat	Anyway, I could have a greater degree of freedom with the families; I just wanted to group them by similar characteristics at first
2015-10-29 05:53:38	En_Passant	But the point is that there are few
2015-10-29 05:53:41	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-29 05:54:00	ScruffyChat	Not counting Ujadani there are 100 unique enemies in the Pikmin series so far
2015-10-29 05:55:04	En_Passant	Are you getting a Fatal error on Fanon?
2015-10-29 05:55:17	ScruffyChat	All the time
2015-10-29 05:55:27	ScruffyChat	It just happens occassionally
2015-10-29 05:55:49	ScruffyChat	It was mentioned before on the forums, but I don't know what exactly can be done about it
2015-10-29 05:56:57	En_Passant	I meant right now
2015-10-29 05:57:03	En_Passant	Looks like it passed, though
2015-10-29 05:57:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it normally happens for me whenever I click a link twice, but it can just happen randomly
2015-10-29 05:58:04	ScruffyChat	I don't know what to do about it
2015-10-29 06:00:59	En_Passant	Funny, the reason you didn't go to bed was I wanted to discuss the enemy distribution in my game, and we haven't done that yet
2015-10-29 06:01:43	En_Passant	As I figured, there are a sizeable amount of enemies in the Verdant Forest region and not a lot elsewhere
2015-10-29 06:01:53	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-29 06:02:02	ScruffyChat	Well, ecologically, that makes sense
2015-10-29 06:02:24	En_Passant	Yeah, but as far as gameplay goes, it's rather bland
2015-10-29 06:02:29	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-29 06:02:43	En_Passant	Valley of Repose and Distant Tundra weren't very deprived of enemies
2015-10-29 06:02:55	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-29 06:03:30	ScruffyChat	From what I've seen, enemies in Pikmin games get not necessarily more difficult but more varying in difficulty as the game progresses
2015-10-29 06:05:09	ScruffyChat	Certainly there's a difficulty curve, but in later areas you can afford to be more exotic with your enemy choices
2015-10-29 06:06:33	En_Passant	Define exotic in this situation
2015-10-29 06:07:07	ScruffyChat	As in, you can choose rarer enemies
2015-10-29 06:07:18	ScruffyChat	Or especially, enemies that can roam farther
2015-10-29 06:08:52	ScruffyChat	The first half of the Valley of Repose is all stationary enemies, while the later half is mostly active enemies that move around
2015-10-29 06:09:51	En_Passant	The second half of Valley of Repose is also mostly empty space
2015-10-29 06:10:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 06:10:43	ScruffyChat	well, same with having the bulbear in the Perplexing Pool or the Groink in the Wistful Wild
2015-10-29 06:11:16	ScruffyChat	Judging the distribution of difficult enemies is based to them not on where they are but on how much time they've had to experience the game
2015-10-29 06:11:49	En_Passant	It's both, I think
2015-10-29 06:12:06	En_Passant	Of course, I have a bunch of slots for new enemies that can fill both criteria
2015-10-29 06:12:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 06:17:04	En_Passant	I currently have 42 regular enemies. Pikmin 2 had 51
2015-10-29 06:17:39	En_Passant	I'm saying that mostly so I can reason what should go where
2015-10-29 06:23:13	En_Passant	Unrelated: What do you think about the classification of Spectralids?
2015-10-29 06:23:53	En_Passant	Should each Unmarked Spectralid color really have its own species?
2015-10-29 06:24:28	En_Passant	I have a theory that a Flitterbie's wing color matching its dropped nectar is a direct effect of drinking that fluid
2015-10-29 06:24:55	En_Passant	That would mean that it should really be the opposite, one Unmarked and one Marked
2015-10-29 06:25:35	En_Passant	Actually, that makes a lot of sense
2015-10-29 06:25:39	En_Passant	Thanks for listening
2015-10-29 06:26:10	En_Passant	... we should go. It's 2:30 there and I'm just rambling to myself about random stuff

2015-10-29 20:15:01	ScruffyChat	Hi!
2015-10-29 20:15:10	@PikFan	I see that you settled on the rover idea
2015-10-29 20:15:22	ScruffyChat	Yeah...
2015-10-29 20:15:31	@PikFan	why the "..."?
2015-10-29 20:15:38	ScruffyChat	I mean, I love robot characters
2015-10-29 20:15:57	ScruffyChat	I'm just sorry it wasn't the Snattle, or other animals we had discussed
2015-10-29 20:16:08	@PikFan	oh, no, it's fine
2015-10-29 20:16:19	@PikFan	I'm not offended or anything
2015-10-29 20:16:32	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-10-29 20:16:46	ScruffyChat	Now it's a matter of updating all the associated articles
2015-10-29 20:16:54	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-29 20:16:57	ScruffyChat	I'm glad there aren't too many yet
2015-10-29 20:17:02	@PikFan	what will we do with LLL?
2015-10-29 20:17:42	ScruffyChat	I've had requests to keep the page there, even though it's not part of PF anymore
2015-10-29 20:17:53	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-29 20:17:55	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-29 20:18:11	@PikFan	maybe have an unused content subpage for PF?
2015-10-29 20:18:23	ScruffyChat	I guess so, but so far nothing else is unused
2015-10-29 20:18:24	@PikFan	and you could put the LLL there and other unused things
2015-10-29 20:18:37	ScruffyChat	Unless I deliberately make pages for the Onion moons and such
2015-10-29 20:19:04	@PikFan	well no, you don't have to
2015-10-29 20:19:17	@PikFan	you could just have a section describing each unused element
2015-10-29 20:19:41	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, that'd work
2015-10-29 20:20:06	@PikFan	[[f:Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds/Unused Content]]

2015-10-29 20:20:30	@PikFan	I should get around to updating that
2015-10-29 20:20:47	ScruffyChat	That's great
2015-10-29 20:20:58	@PikFan	I really did that just for fun
2015-10-29 20:20:58	ScruffyChat	I love how some things were shown at E3
2015-10-29 20:21:20	@PikFan	but then I realized I could actually use it, since I'm overhauling my game anyway
2015-10-29 20:22:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 20:22:53	ScruffyChat	I guess mine could have the Snattle, the mongret, Onion moons, the extra story, things like that
2015-10-29 20:23:04	ScruffyChat	I had more unused content than I though
2015-10-29 20:23:06	ScruffyChat	thought*
2015-10-29 20:23:14	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-29 20:23:25	@PikFan	also the Glade of Daylight vs Canyon of Moonlight
2015-10-29 20:23:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 20:23:51	ScruffyChat	I still have that, but now its DayBreak Glade vs Sunset Islet
2015-10-29 20:24:50	@PikFan	right
2015-10-29 20:24:55	@PikFan	which I love
2015-10-29 20:25:01	Pidgeotto	oh
2015-10-29 20:25:03	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-10-29 20:25:05	Pidgeotto	PikFan is online
2015-10-29 20:25:06	@PikFan	I can just imagine going there and seeing the setting sun

2015-10-29 20:25:20	@PikFan	and wow, that text, I like it
2015-10-29 20:25:23	@PikFan	not much
2015-10-29 20:25:25	Pidgeotto	thanks
2015-10-29 20:25:28	@PikFan	discussing Scruffy's fangame
2015-10-29 20:25:32	Pidgeotto	neat-o
2015-10-29 20:25:36	@PikFan	ypu
2015-10-29 20:25:38	@PikFan	*yup
2015-10-29 20:28:45	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I was discussing the islet with En_Passant last night
2015-10-29 20:28:57	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-29 20:29:04	ScruffyChat	When you get there, there'd be a landing site constructed for you already
2015-10-29 20:29:11	@PikFan	right
2015-10-29 20:29:14	ScruffyChat	Since the rover would be programmed to do that
2015-10-29 20:29:18	@PikFan	because the SOGNO — yes
2015-10-29 20:29:35	@PikFan	by the way, how did you come up with the name "SOGNO"?
2015-10-29 20:29:35	ScruffyChat	And all the puzzles would involve platforms, weights, etc. built by the SOGNO
2015-10-29 20:29:46	ScruffyChat	SPERO= Italian for "I hope"
2015-10-29 20:29:53	ScruffyChat	SOGNO = Italian for "I dream"
2015-10-29 20:30:03	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-29 20:30:05	@PikFan	nice touch
2015-10-29 20:30:23	ScruffyChat	I also had the ideas FISSO, or "I fix", or A1-UT0, encrypted Italian for "I help"
2015-10-29 20:30:44	ScruffyChat	But SOGNO just sounded best
2015-10-29 20:31:13	ScruffyChat	All its attacks will be based on functions it uses to terraform
2015-10-29 20:31:27	ScruffyChat	Flamethrower to clear obstructive plants
2015-10-29 20:31:35	ScruffyChat	And water to put out fires or coolant
2015-10-29 20:32:07	ScruffyChat	And a fan that would spray "toxins," it would spray air that Hocotatians can breath
2015-10-29 20:32:20	ScruffyChat	But of Pikmin, only White Pikmin would be resistant to it
2015-10-29 20:32:26	ScruffyChat	And other such attacks
2015-10-29 20:33:00	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-29 20:33:10	@PikFan	what would it look like?
2015-10-29 20:33:55	ScruffyChat	To me, kind of like the P3 Flint Beetle
2015-10-29 20:34:08	ScruffyChat	Except it crawls around on wiry legs like a Man-at-legs
2015-10-29 20:34:24	ScruffyChat	and has a lens eye and features like the SPERO
2015-10-29 20:34:42	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-29 20:34:52	ScruffyChat	Also, I'm removing the Man-at-Legs from PF and giving its abilities to the SOGNO
2015-10-29 20:35:10	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-29 20:35:15	ScruffyChat	I had originally planned the Man-at-Legs would fire a laser instead of a machine gun
2015-10-29 20:35:39	ScruffyChat	And it could also drop a mine underneath it if Pikmin were crowding it
2015-10-29 20:36:18	ScruffyChat	Now the SOGNO will do those
2015-10-29 20:36:21	@PikFan	I'm liking this
2015-10-29 20:36:25	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-10-29 20:36:34	ScruffyChat	I'm just trying to think what the part Pikmin attack would be
2015-10-29 20:36:39	ScruffyChat	Since it's metal
2015-10-29 20:36:49	ScruffyChat	Maybe it's brain is exposed or something
2015-10-29 20:36:58	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I was thinking
2015-10-29 20:37:08	ScruffyChat	its*
2015-10-29 20:37:09	@PikFan	maybe it overheats and has to expose a part in order to cooldown
2015-10-29 20:37:18	@PikFan	although...
2015-10-29 20:37:19	ScruffyChat	Just like the Armored Cannon Beetle
2015-10-29 20:37:37	@PikFan	considering it's a robot, it should have a coolant system, so that might be useless
2015-10-29 20:37:43	ScruffyChat	Well, I think the final boss should always be open to attack
2015-10-29 20:37:59	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-29 20:38:03	ScruffyChat	There's just better times to attack than others
2015-10-29 20:38:20	ScruffyChat	And perhaps a bit less like the Cannon Beetle and more like the Clamclamp
2015-10-29 20:38:53	ScruffyChat	When Pikmin have attacked it too long, it prepares and then clamps together its cranium or something
2015-10-29 20:39:02	ScruffyChat	Or maybe electrifies to shake off Pikmin 
2015-10-29 20:39:04	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-29 20:39:11	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-10-29 20:39:17	@PikFan	how does electricity work in this game?
2015-10-29 20:39:29	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2015-10-29 20:39:32	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2015-10-29 20:39:42	ScruffyChat	I don't want it to kill instantly
2015-10-29 20:39:55	ScruffyChat	But that's a lot more realistic than just a simple stun
2015-10-29 20:40:05	@PikFan	true
2015-10-29 20:40:20	@PikFan	maybe have varying degrees of electricity...?
2015-10-29 20:40:34	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 20:40:37	ScruffyChat	Simple static
2015-10-29 20:40:41	ScruffyChat	And then high voltage
2015-10-29 20:40:47	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-29 20:40:52	ScruffyChat	So, both P2 and P3 electricity
2015-10-29 20:40:58	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-29 20:40:59	ScruffyChat	And static can stun enemies as well
2015-10-29 20:41:05	ScruffyChat	small ones
2015-10-29 20:41:21	ScruffyChat	I'm trying to make hazards into tools in this game

2015-10-29 20:41:26	@PikFan	I'd color-code it, so it'd be easier to tell which electricity of lethal or not
2015-10-29 20:41:30	@PikFan	hi En_Passant
2015-10-29 20:41:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 20:41:35	@PikFan	but that's just me
2015-10-29 20:41:38	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant
2015-10-29 20:41:52	@PikFan	*which electricity is lethal
2015-10-29 20:42:16	ScruffyChat	I agree
2015-10-29 20:42:41	ScruffyChat	Static would be a dimmer blue, while the real deal would be yello
2015-10-29 20:42:44	ScruffyChat	yellow*
2015-10-29 20:43:30	@PikFan	funnily enough, I was thinking of it that way, just the other way around
2015-10-29 20:43:32	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-10-29 20:43:41	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-29 20:44:17	ScruffyChat	And then, I was thinking it should have one attack to which no Pikmin are immune
2015-10-29 20:44:33	ScruffyChat	Maybe it grabs Pikmin with a grabbing arm
2015-10-29 20:44:58	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-10-29 20:45:02	ScruffyChat	And crushes them like a Shearwig
2015-10-29 20:45:12	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-29 20:45:13	ScruffyChat	*like a Shearwig would
2015-10-29 20:45:28	ScruffyChat	But it would just do this one Pikmin after the other
2015-10-29 20:45:33	ScruffyChat	If you don't avoid it
2015-10-29 20:45:40	@PikFan	how fast would it be?
2015-10-29 20:45:55	En_Passant	Or it uses explosives
2015-10-29 20:46:00	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-29 20:46:11	@PikFan	En_Passant: it does have explosives
2015-10-29 20:46:14	@PikFan	it drops a mine
2015-10-29 20:46:42	@PikFan	here, since you missed it
2015-10-29 20:46:43	@PikFan	13:35	ScruffyChat	And it could also drop a mine underneath it if Pikmin were crowding it
2015-10-29 20:47:01	ScruffyChat	By mine I mean like those mines in Bingo Battle
2015-10-29 20:47:18	En_Passant	Scruffy and I talked about this last night, so I know most of what it does
2015-10-29 20:47:26	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-29 20:47:36	@PikFan	I guess I'm the one who's behind, then :P

2015-10-29 20:48:18	ScruffyChat	This battle also makes a lot more sense than the LLL
2015-10-29 20:48:29	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-29 20:48:29	ScruffyChat	With the LLL, it'd be really hard to keep track of all your Pikmin
2015-10-29 20:48:46	@PikFan	here, it's just a conventional battle
2015-10-29 20:49:41	ScruffyChat	Traditional Pikmin style, I suppose
2015-10-29 20:50:34	ScruffyChat	Also, I think it could have this one attack, sort of a homage to the Emperor Bulblax
2015-10-29 20:51:12	ScruffyChat	At half health, it could climb partly up the tree (which would be next to the arena you fight it in) and then leap off
2015-10-29 20:51:24	En_Passant	Can't it fly?
2015-10-29 20:51:29	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-29 20:51:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 20:51:32	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-10-29 20:51:35	ScruffyChat	Never mind
2015-10-29 20:51:42	ScruffyChat	that'd be pretty dumb of it
2015-10-29 20:52:19	En_Passant	Perfect use of a trope right there
2015-10-29 20:52:31	ScruffyChat	Which one?

2015-10-29 20:53:40	ScruffyChat	Hahaha
2015-10-29 20:53:41	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-10-29 20:54:10	ScruffyChat	Hmmm
2015-10-29 20:54:26	ScruffyChat	If it could fly, I don't know why it wouldn't all the time
2015-10-29 20:54:38	ScruffyChat	Unless flying uses up battery
2015-10-29 20:54:50	ScruffyChat	And while it's solar charging you attack it

2015-10-30 22:18:11	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-30 22:18:23	@PikFan	not much, I'm rereading the plot of PF to understand it better
2015-10-30 22:19:56	@PikFan	hmm, I'm wondering how I can make it so that PCW's main collectible isn't treasure
2015-10-30 22:21:24	ScruffyChat	What do you mean?
2015-10-30 22:21:37	ScruffyChat	There's nothing wrong with treasure
2015-10-30 22:21:43	@PikFan	true
2015-10-30 22:21:48	@PikFan	but it's unoriginal
2015-10-30 22:22:14	@PikFan	...though, changing it to something else might undermine the plot
2015-10-30 22:22:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it's not unoriginal if you can think of all sorts of new treasures
2015-10-30 22:23:11	@PikFan	I suppose so
2015-10-30 22:24:11	ScruffyChat	Is there anything left unclear by the plot?
2015-10-30 22:24:13	ScruffyChat	Just to make sure
2015-10-30 22:24:52	@PikFan	I was initially confused if you had to go back and revisit areas, but that's only because I didn't read the plot in its entirety
2015-10-30 22:25:03	@PikFan	but I understand now
2015-10-30 22:25:14	@PikFan	...actually, I have to leave, my bus will be here soon

2015-11-01 20:30:29	@J	like maybe a category it's in?

2015-11-02 19:08:28	ScruffyChat	How do I do that? It's on a Wikia site
2015-11-02 19:08:38	ScruffyChat	Just anonymously?

2015-11-02 19:09:18	Nvortex	pikmin thrown under a lily pad will pass thraugh it
2015-11-02 19:09:42	Nvortex	the slurker with the juicy gaggle in the tropical wilds can only catch 7 pikmin
2015-11-02 19:09:57	@Espyo	 7 + the fruit?
2015-11-02 19:10:00	Nvortex	yes
2015-11-02 19:10:16	Nvortex	you cant get the fruit without killing it
2015-11-02 19:10:37	@Espyo	well, doesn't it respawn sans fruit?
2015-11-02 19:10:48	Nvortex	what do you mean?
2015-11-02 19:11:10	Nvortex	also enemies that go out of bounds will respawn again in the same place they originally spawn

2015-11-02 19:14:04	ScruffyChat	Oh, if you dodge against a wall there is no time barrier before you can dodge again

2015-11-02 19:14:57	@Espyo	if you come back some days after killing it with the fruit, will it respawn without the fruit?

2015-11-02 22:51:11	ScruffyChat	Everyone here notified me today that somebody copy-pasted Pikmin Forever into another wiki without attributing

2015-11-02 22:52:40	ScruffyChat	http://awesome-pikmin-ideas.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin:_Forever
2015-11-02 22:52:50	ScruffyChat	Some user from Pikmin Wikia
2015-11-02 22:53:01	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-02 22:53:52	ScruffyChat	I've added a comment for this person to attribute me
2015-11-02 22:53:58	ScruffyChat	Otherwise I don't really know what to do
2015-11-02 23:06:19	@PikFan	alright, how does this sound?
2015-11-02 23:06:35	@PikFan	"Hi, I'm PikFan23, an admin over at Pikmin Fanon. I've noticed that you've copied and pasted parts of the fangame Pikmin Forever, as well as a few images from Pikmin Fanon. Please remove this; you neither attributed the original authors nor did you ask permission, and I am sure that the authors would be offended to know that their original work was copied.
2015-11-02 23:06:40	@PikFan	Also, why not create an account on Pikmin Fanon? Not to be overly advertising, but we've actually got a sizable community over at Fanon, and we always appreciate new users, but if you choose to remain on this wiki, then I won't force you to join Fanon. However, please remove the copied content, as it is generally a bad practice to do such things. Thanks."
2015-11-02 23:07:11	@PikFan	Espyo? how do you feel about this situation
2015-11-02 23:07:43	ScruffyChat	That sounds good to me
2015-11-02 23:08:02	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-02 23:08:02	@Espyo	>Not to be overly advertising
2015-11-02 23:08:07	@Espyo	doesn't sound very Englishy

2015-11-02 23:08:53	@PikFan	eh, I'll just get rid of it
2015-11-02 23:08:59	@PikFan	the wikia staff probably won't notice
2015-11-02 23:09:16	@PikFan	and if they do, then I'll just say it was a suggestion
2015-11-02 23:09:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-02 23:10:07	@PikFan	alright, I posted that on his... "message wall"
2015-11-02 23:10:09	@PikFan	ugh

2015-11-02 23:10:43	@PikFan	but wow, I'm glad that we caught that
2015-11-02 23:12:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-02 23:12:33	ScruffyChat	I mean, I guess it's not too bad an offense
2015-11-02 23:12:46	@PikFan	I'm offended by it
2015-11-02 23:12:58	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I am a little
2015-11-02 23:13:02	@PikFan	mainly because it's wikia
2015-11-02 23:13:11	@PikFan	but also the fact that they had the audacity to do that
2015-11-02 23:13:31	@PikFan	like, really? you can't be bothered to create your own original ideas? ugh
2015-11-02 23:13:58	@PikFan	sure, maybe he liked it, and just wanted more people to see it
2015-11-02 23:14:17	@PikFan	but you should really contact somebody before doing that, because otherwise we'll assume plagiarism
2015-11-02 23:14:25	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-11-02 23:15:05	@PikFan	anyway...
2015-11-02 23:15:15	@PikFan	so I'm expanding Stolen Years

2015-11-02 23:23:39	@J	you don't have to ask permission before copying
2015-11-02 23:23:49	@J	just attribute
2015-11-02 23:24:26	@PikFan	it's still courtesy to ask permission, though
2015-11-02 23:24:32	@PikFan	*courteous
2015-11-02 23:24:56	@J	not so much when you choose a license that explicitly says, 'go on, copy this'
2015-11-02 23:25:38	ScruffyChat	<Espyo>I think so, it's just the leaders not moving from where they land in the Garden of Hope on day 9
2015-11-02 23:25:47	ScruffyChat	One picture each bubble of the day
2015-11-02 23:26:19	@PikFan	it just depends on the person, really
2015-11-02 23:26:44	@Espyo	awesome, Scruffy
2015-11-02 23:26:59	@PikFan	I'd like it if a person asked me if they could copy a part of my game first, even if there are licenses that say that you can copy without asking as long as you attribute
2015-11-02 23:27:03	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-11-02 23:27:22	@PikFan	Scruffy: did you get to read it yet?
2015-11-02 23:27:47	@J	let's be clear: it's not 'there are licenses', it's 'the content is specifically released under such a license'
2015-11-02 23:27:52	@J	it's on the bottom of every page
2015-11-02 23:28:51	@J	if I took a CC-BY-SA work, modified it and distributed the modified version, I would be disappointed if the author were offended by that
2015-11-02 23:28:52	@PikFan	so what you're saying is that anything you make is released to the public domain
2015-11-02 23:28:56	@J	no
2015-11-02 23:29:06	@PikFan	that's how it sounded
2015-11-02 23:29:07	@J	anything you make is all rights reserved by default
2015-11-02 23:29:14	@J	unless you explicitly say otherwise
2015-11-02 23:29:17	@J	which we do on the wikis
2015-11-02 23:29:24	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-02 23:29:32	@J	by having a notice at the bottom of every page that relinquishes some of the authors' rights
2015-11-02 23:29:33	@PikFan	anyway, I gotta go, bus will be here soon

2015-11-04 22:24:01	Yoshi2	example: http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Ivey_Bulborb&curid=698&diff=50218&oldid=39195
2015-11-04 22:24:25	Yoshi2	he copied over the information on how to defeat the bulborb into the table
2015-11-04 22:24:31	@Espyo	intelligence? what is that?
2015-11-04 22:24:33	@PikFan	lawl
2015-11-04 22:24:56	Yoshi2	plus adding a bunch of locations I never heard of
2015-11-04 22:25:45	@PikFan	okay so
2015-11-04 22:26:01	@PikFan	last night I decided to update the story of my other fangame, Pikmin: End of Time
2015-11-04 22:26:24	@PikFan	I decided that time actually is made of particles, and that these particles are disappearing
2015-11-04 22:26:46	Nvortex	y
2015-11-04 22:26:50	Nvortex	y u do dis
2015-11-04 22:26:56	@PikFan	because fish
2015-11-04 22:27:09	Nvortex	why would there be the help for the universe on earth
2015-11-04 22:27:16	Yoshi2	you are the george lucas of pikmin fanstories
2015-11-04 22:27:39	Yoshi2	"updating" your older stuff
2015-11-04 22:27:40	@PikFan	Yoshi2: is that a good thing or a bad thing
2015-11-04 22:27:42	Nvortex	hocotatians have technology that literally turns them into energy
2015-11-04 22:27:55	Yoshi2	no idea
2015-11-04 22:28:06	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-04 22:28:09	Nvortex	meanwhile on earth we have pancakes
2015-11-04 22:28:24	Nvortex	“I've found my Chronos Reactor! Using strange new technology, this machine is able to warp the space-time continuum and turn it into energy. I am constantly amazed at how many mysteries are locked inside the parts of my ship... This reactor changes permutations in the space-time continuum into pure energy... Basically, it's like a big rubber band.”
2015-11-04 22:28:24	ScruffyChat	Pancakes are made of particles
2015-11-04 22:28:41	ScruffyChat	A big rubber band? I never got that
2015-11-04 22:29:01	@PikFan	oh, true, I guess it's impractical to have a machine that restores time particles
2015-11-04 22:29:02	Nvortex	“I've found my Gravity Jumper! By manipulating the forces of gravity, this key component gives me the final boost I need to make the jump to super light speed. Good thing I found it. This anti-gravity device allows the Dolphin to swim gracefully through the sea of stars like...a dolphin.”
2015-11-04 22:29:08	@PikFan	but eh
2015-11-04 22:29:35	ScruffyChat	Also why do the Pikmin turn grey?
2015-11-04 22:29:38	@PikFan	well, it could just reset the universe to an earlier time period before all the time particles disappear
2015-11-04 22:29:48	ScruffyChat	I understand the freezing part
2015-11-04 22:29:53	@PikFan	no, not the Pikmin, chunks of space
2015-11-04 22:29:53	Nvortex	early pikmin mechanics
2015-11-04 22:29:58	Nvortex	they thought it would
2015-11-04 22:30:00	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-11-04 22:30:01	@PikFan	like the ground and sucj
2015-11-04 22:30:03	@PikFan	*such
2015-11-04 22:30:08	Nvortex	wait you talking about pikmin the end of time or pikmin 1?
2015-11-04 22:30:11	@PikFan	and Pikmin too, if they're caught in it
2015-11-04 22:30:14	@PikFan	End of Time
2015-11-04 22:30:17	Nvortex	oh
2015-11-04 22:30:19	ScruffyChat	Well if time were stopping them, the light wouldn't be moving; they'd be completely blac
2015-11-04 22:30:21	ScruffyChat	black*
2015-11-04 22:30:33	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-11-04 22:31:06	ScruffyChat	But that's not too importatn
2015-11-04 22:31:09	@PikFan	ok, so this is how I think about time particles, which I named "chrons"
2015-11-04 22:31:27	@PikFan	chrons basically "tell" other particles to go to the next instance of time
2015-11-04 22:32:09	@PikFan	and so the other particles are able to interact because of chrons
2015-11-04 22:32:22	@PikFan	it's like... frames
2015-11-04 22:32:28	ScruffyChat	Planck frames
2015-11-04 22:32:31	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-04 22:32:44	@PikFan	so these chrons update the Planck frames
2015-11-04 22:32:58	ScruffyChat	So it's a big processor metaphor...?
2015-11-04 22:32:59	@PikFan	and without it, the Planck frames don't update, so there's no time
2015-11-04 22:33:07	@PikFan	yeah, you could say that
2015-11-04 22:33:12	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-11-04 22:33:19	ScruffyChat	They'd be four-dimensional then
2015-11-04 22:33:26	@PikFan	I actually just now thought of them like frames, heh
2015-11-04 22:33:38	ScruffyChat	And the spots that don't receive them don't move through 4 dimension
2015-11-04 22:33:41	@PikFan	but yeah, that's a good way to look at it
2015-11-04 22:33:42	ScruffyChat	dimensions*
2015-11-04 22:33:44	@PikFan	right
2015-11-04 22:33:56	ScruffyChat	So what happens if half a Pikmin gets frozen?
2015-11-04 22:34:00	@PikFan	it dies
2015-11-04 22:34:07	ScruffyChat	true

2015-11-04 22:34:25	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant
2015-11-04 22:34:30	@PikFan	hi En_Passant
2015-11-04 22:34:36	En_Passant	hi
2015-11-04 22:35:09	@PikFan	so we're discussing the mechanics of my other fangame, Pikmin: End of Time
2015-11-04 22:35:14	Nvortex	dont tell me: time wraith is final boss
2015-11-04 22:35:20	@PikFan	no
2015-11-04 22:35:23	Nvortex	gud
2015-11-04 22:35:37	ScruffyChat	I looked up "chrons," apparently in real life they're the intervals of time in which the earth reverses magnetic polarity
2015-11-04 22:35:55	@PikFan	if you read the page, I mentioned an advanced civilization, and I'm thinking that the final boss will be a traitor from this civilization
2015-11-04 22:35:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-04 22:36:01	@PikFan	@Scruffy
2015-11-04 22:36:20	@PikFan	so... chron could mean both, actually
2015-11-04 22:36:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-04 22:36:37	ScruffyChat	There are four of them with names
2015-11-04 22:36:47	@PikFan	as for the number of chrons in the universe...
2015-11-04 22:36:57	ScruffyChat	Gilbert, Gauss, Matuyama, and Brunhes
2015-11-04 22:37:08	@PikFan	well, for every elementary particle that exists, so too does a chron
2015-11-04 22:37:14	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-04 22:37:22	@PikFan	but chrons are tiny
2015-11-04 22:37:37	@PikFan	they're probably the size of a Planck length
2015-11-04 22:37:43	-->	RingtailedFox (FoxFoxFox@m57-80-1-20.home.cgocable.net) has joined #pikipedia
2015-11-04 22:38:02	ScruffyChat	What you're talking about is the basics of string theory
2015-11-04 22:38:07	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2015-11-04 22:38:11	ScruffyChat	Replace string with chron
2015-11-04 22:38:22	@PikFan	pretty much, yeah
2015-11-04 22:38:34	@PikFan	except these are 0-dimensional, and strings are 1-dimensional
2015-11-04 22:38:47	ScruffyChat	Strings are 11-dimensional
2015-11-04 22:38:55	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-11-04 22:38:55	ScruffyChat	According to the most recent claims
2015-11-04 22:39:08	ScruffyChat	But the whole theory is really claim-y
2015-11-04 22:39:15	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-04 22:39:21	@PikFan	but that's why it's so fun
2015-11-04 22:39:39	@PikFan	and I really don't understand how the smaller you go, the more dimensions there are
2015-11-04 22:39:47	@PikFan	...and the larger you go, the LESS dimensions
2015-11-04 22:39:54	@PikFan	like the holography principle
2015-11-04 22:40:33	@PikFan	anyway, yeah, chrons are like strings, in a sense
2015-11-04 22:41:12	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-11-04 22:41:16	@PikFan	maybe I should rename them to "chronon," because there's actually a page for that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronon
2015-11-04 22:41:20	ScruffyChat	And they're disappearing
2015-11-04 22:41:30	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-04 22:41:43	ScruffyChat	It's plausible
2015-11-04 22:41:51	ScruffyChat	Seeing how time reacts to very massive objects
2015-11-04 22:42:01	@PikFan	oh, good point
2015-11-04 22:42:14	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm
2015-11-04 22:42:26	En_Passant	But the scale of Pikmin is very small
2015-11-04 22:42:44	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-04 22:43:09	@PikFan	oh, simple fix, if an object with mass is approaching light speed, then less chrons interact with the object
2015-11-04 22:43:24	@PikFan	so... longer "update" time
2015-11-04 22:43:30	@PikFan	and thus, lower speed
2015-11-04 22:43:49	@PikFan	but anyway, what does the scale of Pikmin have to do...?
2015-11-04 22:43:52	ScruffyChat	Well...
2015-11-04 22:44:12	@PikFan	*have to do with this
2015-11-04 22:44:22	ScruffyChat	When things are approaching lightspeed, the length is effected, not necessarily the passage through time
2015-11-04 22:44:28	ScruffyChat	Time is relative to the observer
2015-11-04 22:44:45	ScruffyChat	And not all objects in the universe move forward by frames
2015-11-04 22:44:55	ScruffyChat	Dark matter purportedly moves backward through time
2015-11-04 22:45:20	@PikFan	antichrons, then
2015-11-04 22:45:27	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-04 22:45:49	@PikFan	but where did you hear that? that's very interesting
2015-11-04 22:45:51	ScruffyChat	Perhaps the two cancel each other out
2015-11-04 22:46:04	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-11-04 22:46:20	ScruffyChat	A few sources I can't remember the names of
2015-11-04 22:46:25	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-04 22:46:35	ScruffyChat	Rob... Paulton?
2015-11-04 22:46:38	ScruffyChat	Something like that
2015-11-04 22:46:41	Nvortex	its theorized to move backwards in time*
2015-11-04 22:47:17	@PikFan	regarding the dark matter: it does make sense, I suppose, since that dark matter wants the universe to have a Big Crunch
2015-11-04 22:47:25	ScruffyChat	I doubt most physicists would subscribe to that though
2015-11-04 22:47:31	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-04 22:47:43	ScruffyChat	My astronomy class never brought it up, and we did cover dark matter
2015-11-04 22:48:04	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-04 22:48:05	ScruffyChat	Really dark matter is anything in the equation that estimates the total mass in the universe that we can't see
2015-11-04 22:48:30	ScruffyChat	Hence, dark
2015-11-04 22:48:40	@PikFan	from what I've heard, the universe is like 75% dark energy, 24% dark matter, and 1% regular matter and energy
2015-11-04 22:48:49	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-04 22:48:55	ScruffyChat	We can discern very little of ti
2015-11-04 22:48:56	ScruffyChat	it*
2015-11-04 22:49:09	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-04 22:49:29	@PikFan	since the LHC is more powerful now, I hope they can find any evidence of WIMPS
2015-11-04 22:50:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-04 22:50:49	ScruffyChat	Well anyway, why would chrons be disappearing in End of Time?
2015-11-04 22:51:13	@PikFan	14:35	PikFan	if you read the page, I mentioned an advanced civilization, and I'm thinking that the final boss will be a traitor from this civilization
2015-11-04 22:51:20	ScruffyChat	Oh, right
2015-11-04 22:51:45	@PikFan	so... he somehow causes the chrons to start disappearing
2015-11-04 22:51:55	ScruffyChat	So this pint-sized traitor in a civilization we could run over with a bike is responsible for the deletion of time?
2015-11-04 22:52:05	@PikFan	sure, why not
2015-11-04 22:52:11	ScruffyChat	I love it
2015-11-04 22:52:12	@PikFan	it's all well and good
2015-11-04 22:52:26	@PikFan	plot twist: it's Alph
2015-11-04 22:52:29	@PikFan	kidding
2015-11-04 22:52:37	ScruffyChat	Please
2015-11-04 22:52:45	ScruffyChat	I can see it now
2015-11-04 22:53:03	@PikFan	should I make it a Koppaite, though...?
2015-11-04 22:53:12	ScruffyChat	Maybe
2015-11-04 22:53:20	ScruffyChat	Maybe something goes awry with cosmic drive
2015-11-04 22:53:37	@PikFan	considering this game takes place in an alternate universe, I could repurpose Koppai to anything
2015-11-04 22:54:19	@PikFan	and maybe
2015-11-04 22:54:24	@PikFan	I'm not sure
2015-11-04 22:54:37	@PikFan	anyway, I like where this is headed
2015-11-04 22:54:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-04 22:54:56	@PikFan	one of those days, I need to turn on my old desktop and get those area names out
2015-11-04 22:55:05	@PikFan	*one of these days
2015-11-04 22:55:05	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-04 22:55:18	ScruffyChat	No problem, there's plenty of time for it
2015-11-04 22:55:25	ScruffyChat	until it starts disappearing, that is
2015-11-04 22:55:26	@PikFan	>time
2015-11-04 22:55:27	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-04 22:55:32	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2015-11-04 22:55:34	@PikFan	yay puns
2015-11-04 22:55:44	ScruffyChat	Anyway, I made an unused content page
2015-11-04 22:55:51	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-04 22:55:57	ScruffyChat	So all that stuff is finally behind the current story
2015-11-04 22:56:00	ScruffyChat	And I can continue
2015-11-04 22:56:21	@PikFan	I saw it on the recent changes, but I didn't check it yet since I was so enthralled about talking about this
2015-11-04 22:56:26	@PikFan	and yay
2015-11-04 22:56:32	ScruffyChat	It's really meta to write about your own ideas as if they were previous versions
2015-11-04 22:56:36	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, no problem
2015-11-04 22:56:46	ScruffyChat	I had wanted to ask you about chrons since I read it
2015-11-04 22:57:10	@PikFan	ah, you read it? thanks
2015-11-04 22:57:19	ScruffyChat	Of course
2015-11-04 22:57:27	ScruffyChat	You're a really good writer
2015-11-04 22:57:35	ScruffyChat	Speaking of writing
2015-11-04 22:57:41	ScruffyChat	I started the story of Louie today
2015-11-04 22:58:39	@PikFan	awesome!
2015-11-04 22:58:47	@PikFan	and thanks, but I could be better
2015-11-04 22:58:51	@PikFan	I tend to be wordy
2015-11-04 23:00:05	ScruffyChat	No problem, wordy is good if you use good words
2015-11-04 23:00:29	@PikFan	right, descriptiveness
2015-11-04 23:00:47	ScruffyChat	I'll paste the Louie stuff so you can read it so far
2015-11-04 23:00:52	ScruffyChat	in pastebin
2015-11-04 23:00:57	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-04 23:01:05	ScruffyChat	If you want to read it, that is
2015-11-04 23:01:12	ScruffyChat	It's fine if now
2015-11-04 23:01:13	ScruffyChat	not*
2015-11-04 23:01:27	Nvortex	will lpuie still be loucap?
2015-11-04 23:01:38	ScruffyChat	No, this is right after the events of P3
2015-11-04 23:01:45	ScruffyChat	When he's left behind again
2015-11-04 23:01:47	Nvortex	?
2015-11-04 23:01:58	Nvortex	a back story?
2015-11-04 23:02:00	ScruffyChat	I'm writing the whole story of Louie
2015-11-04 23:02:03	ScruffyChat	As told by Louie
2015-11-04 23:02:20	Nvortex	....food....left behind....giant creatures....food
2015-11-04 23:02:44	ScruffyChat	Yeah, there's a lot of commentary besides the "story
2015-11-04 23:03:13	Nvortex	..food...and then i was inaverdetly left behind by my compatiots, but i know they didnt left me purposefully as i wasnt secured tightly in the belt...food.......creatures
2015-11-04 23:03:52	ScruffyChat	And there's also the stories of why his grandmother raised him (where mother), his dad wanting him to join Hocotate Freight, his never playing outside but instead eating all the plants and bugs from outside
2015-11-04 23:04:01	ScruffyChat	And then the golden pikpik carrot mission
2015-11-04 23:04:17	ScruffyChat	where is his mother*
2015-11-04 23:04:34	@PikFan	ooh
2015-11-04 23:05:14	ScruffyChat	All I've got so far is a little prologue and then Chapter 1
2015-11-04 23:05:20	ScruffyChat	You can tell he's recording this, not writing
2015-11-04 23:05:30	ScruffyChat	I like writing speech rather than narration
2015-11-04 23:06:29	@PikFan	I'm the opposite, but I can write a lot of speech if need be
2015-11-04 23:06:43	Testyo	so what were less damage too
2015-11-04 23:06:54	@PikFan	this is really good fangame music by the way
2015-11-04 23:06:56	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7JlU4xxnJQ
2015-11-04 23:07:13	@PikFan	this was actually what inspired me to redo End of Time's story
2015-11-04 23:07:24	ScruffyChat	nice
2015-11-04 23:07:36	@PikFan	oh, if you met the creator of this...
2015-11-04 23:07:46	@PikFan	you two would make probably the best fangame ever
2015-11-04 23:08:12	ScruffyChat	I can't believe they got away with this
2015-11-04 23:08:22	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-11-04 23:08:24	ScruffyChat	Nintendo would flip their lid
2015-11-04 23:08:35	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-04 23:08:47	ScruffyChat	It very much sounds like paper mario
2015-11-04 23:08:53	@PikFan	like, sure, there's copyright and such
2015-11-04 23:08:56	ScruffyChat	They did their research
2015-11-04 23:09:10	ScruffyChat	True, fangame music wouldn't be as bad
2015-11-04 23:09:19	@PikFan	but still, it'd be nice if Nintendo considered the fans' ideas instead of just striking them down
2015-11-04 23:09:47	@PikFan	"Oh, your idea is based on OUR copyrighted material? We don't care how good it is; away it goes!"
2015-11-04 23:09:55	@PikFan	:(
2015-11-04 23:09:56	ScruffyChat	On their website it just says they get soooooo many
2015-11-04 23:09:58	ScruffyChat	Every day
2015-11-04 23:10:03	ScruffyChat	Every hour really
2015-11-04 23:10:11	@PikFan	fan requests? hmm
2015-11-04 23:10:15	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-04 23:10:41	@PikFan	Aonuma recently said that they're aware of fan suggestions for Zelda Wii U...

2015-11-04 23:11:22	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-04 23:11:47	@PikFan	sometimes I wish Nintendo wasn't a Kyoto-based company

2015-11-04 23:12:43	Nvortex	how is he writing that
2015-11-04 23:13:00	ScruffyChat	He's speaking
2015-11-04 23:13:20	ScruffyChat	As I said, I prefer writing something that sounds like a transcript
2015-11-04 23:13:35	@PikFan	aww
2015-11-04 23:13:40	@PikFan	he feels abandoned
2015-11-04 23:13:53	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-11-04 23:13:56	@PikFan	so... does he attack Olimar and the President out of spite, or...?
2015-11-04 23:14:03	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure about that yet
2015-11-04 23:14:09	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-04 23:14:10	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure he'll be sure about that
2015-11-04 23:14:19	ScruffyChat	Louie can be a really complicated character
2015-11-04 23:14:24	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-04 23:14:25	ScruffyChat	But he will make a lot of comments
2015-11-04 23:14:42	ScruffyChat	I really want him to just go through the Piklopedia and say something about every enemy
2015-11-04 23:14:49	ScruffyChat	At various points
2015-11-04 23:17:56	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-04 23:18:03	@PikFan	sorry, was reading your unused content page
2015-11-04 23:18:10	@PikFan	it's quite indepth
2015-11-04 23:18:30	@PikFan	you even mentioned all the ideas we tossed around on here as well
2015-11-04 23:18:30	ScruffyChat	oh, yeah
2015-11-04 23:18:40	ScruffyChat	I stumbled upon the earliest draft of the story
2015-11-04 23:18:49	ScruffyChat	I edited that a lot before I even put it on fanon
2015-11-04 23:19:18	@PikFan	it confused me for a bit, because it was referring to the SOGNO a lot, but then I realized that it had a different purpose then
2015-11-04 23:20:02	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-11-04 23:20:20	@PikFan	I was thinking of renaming PCW to something like "Pikmin: Ambition"
2015-11-04 23:20:53	@PikFan	because both sides are ambitious: one seeks to colonize the planet, the other seeks to overthrow the government
2015-11-04 23:20:58	@PikFan	both are pretty ambitious

2015-11-04 23:47:36	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-11-04 23:47:47	ScruffyChat	It seemed pretty detailed
2015-11-04 23:49:09	En_Passant	The page on Fantendo doesn't match up with the artwork for the music

2015-11-04 23:51:40	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-11-04 23:52:36	En_Passant	PikFan, you've gotten me hooked on this Paper Mario fangame
2015-11-04 23:52:42	En_Passant	But there appears to be two versions
2015-11-04 23:52:48	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-04 23:52:53	ScruffyChat	The Rewind Chronicles?
2015-11-04 23:52:58	@PikFan	Rewind Chronicles is the newer version
2015-11-04 23:53:10	@PikFan	it's a reboot of Countdown to Chaos, the original version

2015-11-04 23:53:43	@PikFan	similar to how Pikmin: Ambition is basically now a reboot of PCW
2015-11-04 23:54:06	En_Passant	oh
2015-11-04 23:54:19	En_Passant	That would explain why
2015-11-04 23:54:28	@PikFan	...funnily enough, "Pikmin: Ambition" is also symbolic of my ambition to improve PCW
2015-11-04 23:54:35	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-04 23:54:38	En_Passant	I thought I was reading CtC's page on Fantendo
2015-11-04 23:54:47	En_Passant	whoops
2015-11-04 23:55:00	@PikFan	Rewind Chronicles is what you're looking for
2015-11-04 23:55:04	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-04 23:55:10	En_Passant	rip Gentleman Boo
2015-11-04 23:55:14	@PikFan	it seems like a good game
2015-11-04 23:55:17	@PikFan	I'd play it
2015-11-04 23:55:27	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-11-04 23:55:33	ScruffyChat	It's very detailed
2015-11-04 23:55:47	@PikFan	sadly, the creator doesn't want people actually programming it
2015-11-04 23:55:55	@PikFan	but that's understandable
2015-11-04 23:56:13	@PikFan	he just doesn't want to be found out
2015-11-04 23:57:49	@PikFan	say, Scruffy
2015-11-04 23:57:59	ScruffyChat	Mhmm?
2015-11-04 23:58:04	@PikFan	where on Pikmin Fanon would you be putting your story?
2015-11-04 23:58:14	ScruffyChat	Oh, I don't know
2015-11-04 23:58:18	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-04 23:58:27	ScruffyChat	Should I just make a new page for it?
2015-11-04 23:58:32	ScruffyChat	Once I have enough
2015-11-04 23:58:37	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-04 23:59:17	ScruffyChat	Do all stories go in the Story Archive page?
2015-11-04 23:59:25	@PikFan	they don't have to
2015-11-04 23:59:34	@PikFan	only if they're featured on the main page
2015-11-05 00:00:01	@PikFan	I mean... do you want it to be on the main page? that could be done
2015-11-05 00:00:23	ScruffyChat	It doesn't matter to me, but I feel like eventually someone else should be featured
2015-11-05 00:00:32	ScruffyChat	The KHA Lander is kinda hogging the screen
2015-11-05 00:00:33	@PikFan	fair enough
2015-11-05 00:00:43	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-05 00:01:04	@PikFan	is the main page squished a lot on mobile?
2015-11-05 00:01:17	ScruffyChat	No, mobile is the same as desktop view
2015-11-05 00:01:21	ScruffyChat	for me at least
2015-11-05 00:01:22	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-05 00:01:55	ScruffyChat	But yeah, thank you for featuring my game, but eventually I wanna give someone else a change
2015-11-05 00:01:55	@PikFan	hm, I should ask Espyo sometime if he could create a new poll for Fanon
2015-11-05 00:01:57	ScruffyChat	cahnce*
2015-11-05 00:02:00	ScruffyChat	chance*
2015-11-05 00:02:10	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 00:02:29	@PikFan	the problem is, just about all of the highest quality games have been featured...
2015-11-05 00:03:06	ScruffyChat	How about Pikmin V?
2015-11-05 00:03:14	@PikFan	OH!
2015-11-05 00:03:17	@PikFan	of course!
2015-11-05 00:03:34	ScruffyChat	Hahaha
2015-11-05 00:03:35	@PikFan	sorry En_Passant
2015-11-05 00:03:55	@PikFan	but yeah, I'll definitely feature Pikmin V
2015-11-05 00:04:07	ScruffyChat	Yay
2015-11-05 00:04:18	@PikFan	and then... I don't know
2015-11-05 00:04:31	@PikFan	I'll probably pull from one of the articles you've made
2015-11-05 00:04:40	ScruffyChat	Heh okay
2015-11-05 00:04:43	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-11-05 00:04:48	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 00:05:02	ScruffyChat	How often does it change?
2015-11-05 00:05:02	@PikFan	same for images; the quality of your images is second to none on the wiki
2015-11-05 00:05:10	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-11-05 00:05:23	@PikFan	it changes... well, there's not really a set date
2015-11-05 00:05:39	@PikFan	it depends on the activity, really
2015-11-05 00:05:49	En_Passant	Deathbone Desert was up for over a year I think
2015-11-05 00:05:57	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-05 00:06:03	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-05 00:06:13	@PikFan	well okay, no, it doesn't depend on the activity
2015-11-05 00:06:19	@PikFan	depends on what's available
2015-11-05 00:06:39	@PikFan	...so I guess it still is dependent on activity
2015-11-05 00:06:42	En_Passant	Which is to say, nothing good before Scruffy came
2015-11-05 00:07:02	@PikFan	well, almost nothing good
2015-11-05 00:07:15	@PikFan	my game, your game, and then like one or two others
2015-11-05 00:07:18	ScruffyChat	I just need to make tutorials on how to use Blender, that way we can all make the images in our head look good in 3d
2015-11-05 00:07:21	ScruffyChat	or 2d
2015-11-05 00:07:25	ScruffyChat	OR 4D
2015-11-05 00:07:35	@PikFan	omg
2015-11-05 00:07:45	@PikFan	ah, if only...
2015-11-05 00:07:47	@PikFan	wait, we can
2015-11-05 00:07:51	@PikFan	it's called gifs
2015-11-05 00:07:57	ScruffyChat	Haha yep
2015-11-05 00:08:29	@PikFan	I tried making a simple gif with GIMP once
2015-11-05 00:08:30	ScruffyChat	Also there's something called Sketchfab
2015-11-05 00:08:32	@PikFan	...never again
2015-11-05 00:08:44	@PikFan	Sketchfab? never heard of it
2015-11-05 00:08:48	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, it was a pain in several areas to make the P3 daylight cycle gif
2015-11-05 00:08:58	@PikFan	I've heard of something similar called SketchUp...
2015-11-05 00:09:04	ScruffyChat	Sketchfab allows you to embed a rotatable 3D model in your online page
2015-11-05 00:09:05	@PikFan	ouch
2015-11-05 00:09:09	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-05 00:09:45	ScruffyChat	I don't think they could be embedded in a wiki though
2015-11-05 00:09:52	ScruffyChat	It'd have to be an external link
2015-11-05 00:10:02	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-05 00:10:18	@PikFan	maybe it can
2015-11-05 00:10:38	@PikFan	I think you can embed anything as long as it's got the <embed> tags
2015-11-05 00:10:48	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-11-05 00:10:50	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-11-05 00:10:51	@PikFan	I'm not sure, though
2015-11-05 00:10:59	@PikFan	you'd have to ask Espyo or J
2015-11-05 00:11:02	ScruffyChat	Well, you wouldn't want to rotate any of my models
2015-11-05 00:11:12	ScruffyChat	As long as they're still, I only make what you see
2015-11-05 00:11:23	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-05 00:11:28	ScruffyChat	The backsides of my models are pretty plain
2015-11-05 00:11:41	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 00:12:02	@PikFan	oh, speaking of backsides
2015-11-05 00:13:34	@PikFan	there's a P3 voyage log entry where a character mentions the other side of PNF-404
2015-11-05 00:13:37	@PikFan	"Still...I can't help but wonder about the other side of this planet. What could be there? It piques my curiosity as an explorer, but I suppose it's not worth the risk this time."
2015-11-05 00:13:46	ScruffyChat	This Time
2015-11-05 00:13:50	ScruffyChat	P4 confirmed
2015-11-05 00:13:58	@PikFan	that's what I'm thinking
2015-11-05 00:14:06	@PikFan	it might be a P4 foreshadowing
2015-11-05 00:14:16	ScruffyChat	Well, still, that's not a big deal if they visit the other side
2015-11-05 00:14:23	ScruffyChat	It's just new areas
2015-11-05 00:14:33	@PikFan	but that is a big deal...
2015-11-05 00:14:38	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-05 00:14:55	ScruffyChat	What I mean is, it's not much to the story which side of the planet they visit
2015-11-05 00:14:56	@PikFan	especially if they're crazy exotic areas transformed by radiation
2015-11-05 00:14:59	ScruffyChat	Unless it is
2015-11-05 00:15:05	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, true
2015-11-05 00:15:07	@PikFan	okay, that might be a bit uch
2015-11-05 00:15:09	@PikFan	*much
2015-11-05 00:15:16	@PikFan	but P4 needs to have more areas
2015-11-05 00:15:21	ScruffyChat	Agreed
2015-11-05 00:15:24	@PikFan	at least six or seven
2015-11-05 00:15:31	@PikFan	I liked P3, but it was so short...
2015-11-05 00:15:59	ScruffyChat	I was hoping they'd release DLC for Bingo Battle
2015-11-05 00:16:05	ScruffyChat	I wanted to Bingo Battle in the snow
2015-11-05 00:16:09	@PikFan	P4 would be a combo of the best parts of the past games while introducing new things
2015-11-05 00:16:12	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-05 00:16:24	ScruffyChat	That's why Pikmin Forever has the Sandbox
2015-11-05 00:16:27	@PikFan	ugh, that April Fool's joke made me really upset
2015-11-05 00:16:37	ScruffyChat	Which one?
2015-11-05 00:16:49	@PikFan	on April Fool's day there was a PikCast talking about P3 DLC
2015-11-05 00:16:55	@PikFan	of course, it was fake
2015-11-05 00:17:06	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-05 00:17:08	@PikFan	I fell for it big time ._.

2015-11-05 00:17:23	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-05 00:17:46	En_Passant	Wait wait wait
2015-11-05 00:17:53	En_Passant	The other side of the planet is water
2015-11-05 00:17:58	En_Passant	Because Pangaea
2015-11-05 00:17:59	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-05 00:18:01	ScruffyChat	Ultima
2015-11-05 00:18:05	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-11-05 00:18:08	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-05 00:18:11	En_Passant	Supercontinent
2015-11-05 00:18:18	ScruffyChat	Maybe its just their speculation
2015-11-05 00:18:21	ScruffyChat	it's
2015-11-05 00:18:42	@PikFan	well, who knows? there could be another continent that rose up
2015-11-05 00:18:54	ScruffyChat	I think I had a dream once that there was one cave in a Pikmin game that was entirely underwater
2015-11-05 00:18:56	@PikFan	P3's world map is just based off of Pangaea Ultima
2015-11-05 00:19:07	ScruffyChat	You know you've played Pikmin enough when it starts entering your dreams
2015-11-05 00:19:07	@PikFan	oh, cool
2015-11-05 00:19:13	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-05 00:19:25	ScruffyChat	I've had three Pikmin dreams to date actually
2015-11-05 00:19:27	@PikFan	I've had a few Pikmin dreams before
2015-11-05 00:19:58	ScruffyChat	Hehe maybe we should include a Pikmin dream interpreter on Fanon
2015-11-05 00:20:12	@PikFan	about Pangaea Ultima: but maybe there just is water and no land, as sad as that would be
2015-11-05 00:20:17	@PikFan	ooh
2015-11-05 00:20:29	ScruffyChat	"If a Spotty Bulbear appears in your dream, you are worried about some upcoming event in your life turning out a failure"
2015-11-05 00:20:46	@PikFan	brilliant
2015-11-05 00:21:06	@PikFan	wait, hold on
2015-11-05 00:21:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah but completely false
2015-11-05 00:21:12	ScruffyChat	I'd have no way of checking
2015-11-05 00:21:15	@PikFan	let me grab some logs real quick
2015-11-05 00:21:24	@PikFan	(actually might take longer)
2015-11-05 00:21:25	ScruffyChat	I barely remember what my dream Bulbear did
2015-11-05 00:21:27	ScruffyChat	Besides sleep
2015-11-05 00:21:38	@PikFan	but I have some logs about me describing a Pikmin dream a couple times
2015-11-05 00:21:42	En_Passant	Spotty Bulbear seems like it would be that you're running from something
2015-11-05 00:21:51	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I was just making something up
2015-11-05 00:21:57	En_Passant	oh
2015-11-05 00:22:07	En_Passant	Not everyone believes that dreams have meaning, though
2015-11-05 00:22:13	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-05 00:22:59	ScruffyChat	I thought this would sort of be a joke
2015-11-05 00:23:09	ScruffyChat	I have no idea what Pikmin was doing in my dreams
2015-11-05 00:23:15	ScruffyChat	Besides telling me I play it a lot
2015-11-05 00:31:51	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/iJW0T3a4
2015-11-05 00:32:03	@PikFan	I don't even remember that lol
2015-11-05 00:32:07	@PikFan	that was over 2 years ago
2015-11-05 00:32:38	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-05 00:32:57	ScruffyChat	Everyone's dreams always make more logical sense than mine
2015-11-05 00:33:10	@PikFan	why do you say that?
2015-11-05 00:33:38	ScruffyChat	Like, what you described is very coherent
2015-11-05 00:33:46	ScruffyChat	And fits within Pikmin
2015-11-05 00:33:56	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-05 00:34:09	@PikFan	yeah, that dream was quite specific...
2015-11-05 00:34:31	@PikFan	ah, the mysteries of the mind
2015-11-05 00:34:38	ScruffyChat	My first Pikmin dream involved me in a patio with glass doors, and outside was a plain of little foothills
2015-11-05 00:34:46	ScruffyChat	But they were divided into rectangles
2015-11-05 00:34:52	ScruffyChat	as though they were pixelated
2015-11-05 00:35:01	ScruffyChat	Riemann sums, that's what it's called
2015-11-05 00:35:18	ScruffyChat	And a bunch of different grub-dogs slept on that
2015-11-05 00:35:24	ScruffyChat	No Pikmin, just grub-dogs
2015-11-05 00:35:29	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-05 00:35:53	ScruffyChat	Funny, I've never actually seen Pikmin in my dreams
2015-11-05 00:36:03	@PikFan	really? wow
2015-11-05 00:36:10	ScruffyChat	I've seen Olimar, the Emperor Bulblax, those grub-dogs, and a Gatling Groink
2015-11-05 00:36:14	ScruffyChat	And I think that's it
2015-11-05 00:36:36	@PikFan	now that you mention it, I saw the Emperor Bulblax in a dream once, too
2015-11-05 00:36:38	@PikFan	so did Espyo
2015-11-05 00:37:04	En_Passant	It's coming for you all
2015-11-05 00:37:13	@PikFan	people like dreaming about the Emperor Bulblax, it seems
2015-11-05 00:37:14	En_Passant	I don't think I've had any Pikmin dreams
2015-11-05 00:37:15	@PikFan	lol yeah
2015-11-05 00:37:49	ScruffyChat	I'd love a Bulblax as a pet
2015-11-05 00:38:28	ScruffyChat	Anyway, the dream I had with Olimar was the strangest of the Pikmin-related dreams
2015-11-05 00:38:34	ScruffyChat	(non-Pikmin related get stranger)
2015-11-05 00:38:48	ScruffyChat	but he went into a hole in this generic autumn-colored area
2015-11-05 00:39:06	ScruffyChat	And I guess it was supposed to resemble the Submerged Castle
2015-11-05 00:39:13	ScruffyChat	But it started on Sublevel 3
2015-11-05 00:39:22	@PikFan	huh
2015-11-05 00:39:24	ScruffyChat	And the research pod or Pikmin weren't there
2015-11-05 00:39:36	ScruffyChat	Nor was there any ground
2015-11-05 00:39:43	ScruffyChat	Olimar was swimming under water
2015-11-05 00:39:51	ScruffyChat	In a very plain, very large spage
2015-11-05 00:39:54	ScruffyChat	space*
2015-11-05 00:40:04	ScruffyChat	And there was no way to reference where he was
2015-11-05 00:40:04	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-05 00:40:19	@PikFan	so it was just water everywhere, like he was in a lake?
2015-11-05 00:40:36	ScruffyChat	Yeah, except the color scheme was like that of the Submerged Castle
2015-11-05 00:40:44	ScruffyChat	two black walls FAR in the distance
2015-11-05 00:40:56	ScruffyChat	And a drab greenish blue everywhere else
2015-11-05 00:41:36	ScruffyChat	I could probably make a Blender image of it
2015-11-05 00:42:06	@PikFan	that is strange
2015-11-05 00:52:16	@PikFan	gotta go, back later
2015-11-05 00:52:23	@PikFan	probably an hour or so
2015-11-05 00:52:29	@PikFan	if you'll still be on then

2015-11-05 01:50:34	ScruffyChat	Should I revert the edit then?
2015-11-05 01:51:00	Nvortex	of course
2015-11-05 01:51:10	Nvortex	and in the edit description alsowrite why

2015-11-05 01:52:45	Nvortex	can i post that on his talk pages?
2015-11-05 01:54:31	ScruffyChat	I guess so
2015-11-05 01:54:59	ScruffyChat	He is creating one now, though, apparently
2015-11-05 01:55:19	Nvortex	he did 1

2015-11-05 02:03:16	@PikFan	okay, so that Cayden guy edited PF? ugh
2015-11-05 02:03:20	Nvortex	i just realized
2015-11-05 02:03:27	@PikFan	I wonder what his deal is
2015-11-05 02:03:29	Nvortex	all of the enemies he added arent his
2015-11-05 02:03:33	Nvortex	they are copied too
2015-11-05 02:03:42	@PikFan	bleh
2015-11-05 02:04:12	@PikFan	Scruffy, do you want me to protect PF?
2015-11-05 02:04:32	ScruffyChat	What does that mean?
2015-11-05 02:04:44	@PikFan	well, admins can add protection layers to a page
2015-11-05 02:05:05	@PikFan	most pages usually have no protection, so anybody (even anons) can edit
2015-11-05 02:05:18	@PikFan	then there's a level where only autoconfirmed users can edit
2015-11-05 02:05:25	@PikFan	and the highest level is admin only
2015-11-05 02:05:42	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-11-05 02:05:56	ScruffyChat	Well then, go ahead
2015-11-05 02:05:59	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-05 02:06:01	ScruffyChat	If you don't mind
2015-11-05 02:06:27	ScruffyChat	Sorry it has to happen to PF
2015-11-05 02:06:38	@PikFan	no, no, it's fine
2015-11-05 02:06:47	@PikFan	the higher quality games tend to be protected
2015-11-05 02:06:57	ScruffyChat	So who are autoconfirmed users?
2015-11-05 02:07:27	@PikFan	after you've made a certain amount of edits and had an account for a certain amount of time, you become autoconfirmed
2015-11-05 02:07:34	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-05 02:07:55	@PikFan	it's a defensive measure against spambots
2015-11-05 02:08:02	@PikFan	...I think
2015-11-05 02:08:04	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-11-05 02:08:14	@PikFan	I'm not real sure what the purpose of autoconfirmation is

2015-11-05 02:09:59	ScruffyChat	I just don't understand it
2015-11-05 02:10:08	ScruffyChat	It seems more difficult to write in title case
2015-11-05 02:10:31	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-11-05 02:10:50	ScruffyChat	Unless he's putting all of it through a translator from a different language
2015-11-05 02:12:16	@PikFan	yeah, his grammar seems to be choppy
2015-11-05 02:14:27	ScruffyChat	But he can obviously read English, so it just doesn't make sense
2015-11-05 02:14:46	Nvortex	you might want to protect everything pikmin forever related

2015-11-05 02:18:48	@PikFan	well, it's a good thing you recognized which one was the superior — right
2015-11-05 02:19:07	ScruffyChat	And I like Media-Wiki's organization a lot more

2015-11-05 03:05:32	@PikFan	okay, does this sound stern enough?
2015-11-05 03:05:39	@PikFan	"Good to see that you're editing here instead of wikia. That said, please don't add stuff to other people's game articles like you did with Pikmin Forever. That's not a good habit. Also, please try to make good, constructive edits. It's Not A Good Idea To Type Like This All The Time And It Just Looks Bad. Remember to follow our Policies and read the Help
2015-11-05 03:05:52	@PikFan	Pages if you need help. If you have any questions, you may ask me on my talk page."
2015-11-05 03:06:22	ScruffyChat	Yes, definitely
2015-11-05 03:06:32	ScruffyChat	Meaning well but still stern
2015-11-05 03:06:38	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 03:07:22	@PikFan	okay, saving
2015-11-05 03:07:32	@PikFan	well, hopefully he'll start to figure things out
2015-11-05 03:07:37	@PikFan	but I doubt it
2015-11-05 03:07:45	@PikFan	he seems like one of THOSE users...
2015-11-05 03:08:09	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately
2015-11-05 03:08:25	@PikFan	he'll lose interest eventually
2015-11-05 03:08:27	ScruffyChat	heh it's funny his page starts with Nvortex's comment
2015-11-05 03:08:32	@PikFan	quickly, I hope
2015-11-05 03:08:35	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-11-05 03:08:49	@PikFan	this guy is poison
2015-11-05 03:08:58	@PikFan	I should've just left him at wikia
2015-11-05 03:09:00	@PikFan	but nooooo
2015-11-05 03:09:07	@PikFan	I made the decision to bring him here
2015-11-05 03:09:10	ScruffyChat	He's still on wikia
2015-11-05 03:09:13	@PikFan	now we have to pay the price
2015-11-05 03:09:16	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2015-11-05 03:09:17	ScruffyChat	As Espyo said, free destruction
2015-11-05 03:09:26	@PikFan	I should've left him as is
2015-11-05 03:09:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I suppose
2015-11-05 03:09:53	@PikFan	I should've told him to take down the content
2015-11-05 03:09:55	ScruffyChat	I doubt he's going to do anything about his copy-pasted articles
2015-11-05 03:10:03	@PikFan	but I shouldn't have mentioned anything about our wiki
2015-11-05 03:10:06	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-05 03:10:22	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-05 03:10:26	@PikFan	sticky messes are sticky
2015-11-05 03:10:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-05 03:10:37	ScruffyChat	It'll pass though
2015-11-05 03:10:42	@PikFan	yep
2015-11-05 03:10:52	Nvortex	LOL
2015-11-05 03:11:02	@PikFan	?
2015-11-05 03:11:02	Nvortex	its true, his page starts with my comment
2015-11-05 03:11:20	@PikFan	I'm only keeping it in chronological order
2015-11-05 03:11:28	Nvortex	the best part is, he hanst deleted it
2015-11-05 03:11:37	@PikFan	lol yeah
2015-11-05 03:11:42	@PikFan	he probably won't
2015-11-05 03:11:44	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, he left pretty soon after he made the edits
2015-11-05 03:11:56	@PikFan	like I said, he's one of *those* users...
2015-11-05 03:13:34	Nvortex	<ScruffyChat>: Oh yeah, he left pretty soon after he made the edits
2015-11-05 03:13:37	Nvortex	what do you mean?
2015-11-05 03:13:41	@PikFan	guys look what I just did http://awesome-pikmin-ideas.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin:_Forever
2015-11-05 03:13:43	Nvortex	he hasnt left yet

2015-11-05 03:14:41	@PikFan	lol
2015-11-05 03:14:42	Nvortex	he is bringing back wikia
2015-11-05 03:14:43	Nvortex	slowly
2015-11-05 03:14:51	@PikFan	KILL IT WITH FIRE
2015-11-05 03:14:55	@PikFan	no seriously
2015-11-05 03:14:57	ScruffyChat	There's no way to delete a site, is there?
2015-11-05 03:15:06	@PikFan	sadly, no
2015-11-05 03:15:16	@PikFan	the wikia staff is too greedy to let that happen
2015-11-05 03:15:23	ScruffyChat	I mean, I'm not signed in to Wikia, I could go in and just start deleting content from pages
2015-11-05 03:15:39	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 03:15:44	ScruffyChat	Would there be any staff active to change it?
2015-11-05 03:15:52	@PikFan	idk
2015-11-05 03:16:05	ScruffyChat	I don't know either, that's kind of diabolical
2015-11-05 03:16:12	ScruffyChat	Neveermind
2015-11-05 03:16:44	@PikFan	well, we'll just see how things go with me clearing that pseudo-PF
2015-11-05 03:17:18	Nvortex	dont
2015-11-05 03:17:24	Nvortex	he will try to get his revenge
2015-11-05 03:17:41	@PikFan	doubtful
2015-11-05 03:17:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-05 03:18:11	ScruffyChat	Something tells me it doesn't matter what content is on the pages as long as his is added
2015-11-05 03:18:44	@PikFan	probably
2015-11-05 03:18:56	@PikFan	hey Nvortex is anyone on the skype group right now
2015-11-05 03:19:40	Nvortex	yeah
2015-11-05 03:19:53	@PikFan	are you guys talking about this

2015-11-05 03:22:40	@PikFan	it's a meme

2015-11-05 03:22:57	ScruffyChat	I'm old
2015-11-05 03:23:39	@PikFan	nah it's fine
2015-11-05 03:23:51	@PikFan	you're not old if you know how to internet
2015-11-05 03:23:59	Nvortex	well not really
2015-11-05 03:24:09	Nvortex	i linked it
2015-11-05 03:24:20	@PikFan	I'm not seeing the link
2015-11-05 03:24:25	@PikFan	try again
2015-11-05 03:24:30	Nvortex	wait what?
2015-11-05 03:24:45	@PikFan	you said you linked it...?
2015-11-05 03:24:57	@PikFan	and I said that I didn't see a link
2015-11-05 03:25:19	@PikFan	...wait, what are you even talking about? what are you linking to anyway lol
2015-11-05 03:25:39	Nvortex	you asked me if the skype group was talking about it, i said i linked that stuff
2015-11-05 03:25:46	Nvortex	they just agreed he is cancer
2015-11-05 03:25:50	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-05 03:25:52	@PikFan	OH
2015-11-05 03:25:54	@PikFan	derp
2015-11-05 03:26:09	ScruffyChat	Are you in video chat with the group? or just text chat
2015-11-05 03:26:32	Nvortex	its text chat
2015-11-05 03:26:41	Nvortex	there are only 2 online right now 
2015-11-05 03:26:49	Nvortex	aside from me
2015-11-05 03:27:00	Nvortex	there is a call every night
2015-11-05 03:27:14	Nvortex	but not video
2015-11-05 03:27:19	@PikFan	I can't use skype :(
2015-11-05 03:27:28	Nvortex	i think its because skype has a limit of people
2015-11-05 03:27:40	@PikFan	no, it's not that
2015-11-05 03:27:43	Nvortex	since the limit of 24 is reached there can be video calls or something lik that
2015-11-05 03:27:45	@PikFan	I don't have a microsoft email
2015-11-05 03:27:57	Nvortex	i was talking about video calls lol
2015-11-05 03:27:57	@PikFan	and I honestly don't feel like making one
2015-11-05 03:28:02	Nvortex	and why not make one?
2015-11-05 03:28:24	@PikFan	and even if I did, the skype program on this computer only allows one email >_>
2015-11-05 03:28:35	Nvortex	what a shame
2015-11-05 03:28:42	@PikFan	so I'd have to make an entirely new account on the computer just to use skype
2015-11-05 03:28:57	@PikFan	this isn't even mine; it's my mom's
2015-11-05 03:29:00	@PikFan	we share it
2015-11-05 03:29:23	@PikFan	long story short: I can't use skype

2015-11-05 03:33:46	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-11-05 03:34:08	ScruffyChat	Would that be going on during gameplay?
2015-11-05 03:34:19	ScruffyChat	Like, you have to avoid spots that suddenly get darker
2015-11-05 03:34:41	@PikFan	yeah, it'll be a hazard
2015-11-05 03:34:59	@PikFan	in the beginning, they probably won't be permanent
2015-11-05 03:35:05	@PikFan	it's like they're unstable
2015-11-05 03:35:23	@PikFan	but as the game goes on, some spots become permanently blacked out
2015-11-05 03:35:39	Nvortex	what happens if you get near an anomaly or whatever those weird temporal spaces are called
2015-11-05 03:36:30	@PikFan	realistically, if you walked into one of those, you'd die
2015-11-05 03:36:48	@PikFan	but since I don't want that to happen, we'll just act like they're obstacles
2015-11-05 03:37:00	ScruffyChat	Ah

2015-11-05 03:49:39	ScruffyChat	Back
2015-11-05 03:49:45	@PikFan	hi
2015-11-05 03:49:54	@PikFan	ok, so I had this idea
2015-11-05 03:50:05	ScruffyChat	Sorry, I had technical difficultires
2015-11-05 03:50:09	ScruffyChat	ties*
2015-11-05 03:50:12	@PikFan	it's fine
2015-11-05 03:50:44	@PikFan	so I was thinking that the resources that you collect would be used to power this machine that restores chrons
2015-11-05 03:51:00	@PikFan	but instead of restoring chrons for the whole universe, it could be more local
2015-11-05 03:51:15	@PikFan	and as such, it becomes a gameplay element
2015-11-05 03:52:10	@PikFan	so using this machine in front of anomalies (thanks Nvortex) would restore their chrons, and the anomaly would disappear, letting you walk through it once again
2015-11-05 03:53:14	ScruffyChat	Oh, neat
2015-11-05 03:53:25	@PikFan	the machine also protects Olimar, the Pikmin, the ship and the Onion from turning into anomalies
2015-11-05 03:53:32	ScruffyChat	And the larger the anomaly, the more it costs
2015-11-05 03:53:38	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-05 03:53:41	ScruffyChat	That's a cool mechanic
2015-11-05 03:53:46	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 03:54:03	ScruffyChat	Maybe then whole areas could be frozen until you hit a quota or an upgrade for the machine
2015-11-05 03:54:14	@PikFan	the protection thing also requires a certain amount of resources
2015-11-05 03:54:28	@PikFan	so basically like P3/PF with the juice and metal, respectively
2015-11-05 03:54:47	@PikFan	and I agree with that idea
2015-11-05 03:54:55	@PikFan	the machine would become more efficient
2015-11-05 03:55:26	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-05 03:55:40	ScruffyChat	Except unlike P3/PF, its not resources for more time to play
2015-11-05 03:55:46	ScruffyChat	It's resources for more space to play
2015-11-05 03:55:51	ScruffyChat	Which is really cool
2015-11-05 03:55:55	ScruffyChat	It's a fresh idea
2015-11-05 03:56:00	@PikFan	well, it's both, but yeah
2015-11-05 03:56:06	ScruffyChat	Heh yeah
2015-11-05 03:56:24	@PikFan	if you go below the minimum amount of resources, things start getting risky
2015-11-05 03:56:55	@PikFan	you could become an anomaly anytime after you pass below the minimum limit
2015-11-05 03:57:22	@PikFan	so you want to keep your resource count above that limit
2015-11-05 03:57:37	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2015-11-05 03:57:39	ScruffyChat	Scary
2015-11-05 03:57:50	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 03:58:10	@PikFan	fear of the known is one thing, but fear of the unknown is another
2015-11-05 04:00:01	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-05 04:00:14	@PikFan	I like this
2015-11-05 04:00:20	@PikFan	this feels innovative
2015-11-05 04:00:36	@PikFan	for once I'm being innovative!
2015-11-05 04:01:03	@PikFan	the plot is becoming even more seamless with the gameplay, which I love
2015-11-05 04:01:18	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-05 04:01:26	ScruffyChat	I love it too
2015-11-05 04:01:31	@PikFan	yay
2015-11-05 04:01:32	ScruffyChat	This is a really cool idea
2015-11-05 04:01:40	ScruffyChat	And I had an idea for cover art
2015-11-05 04:01:47	Nvortex	but that means that for X number of days those spaces were frozen in time meaning that if you were on day 65 and the anomaly appeared on day 1, that space would 64 days younger thatn the other one
2015-11-05 04:01:49	@PikFan	oh really?
2015-11-05 04:02:05	ScruffyChat	Woah, that's true
2015-11-05 04:02:10	ScruffyChat	You'd have to account for that
2015-11-05 04:02:10	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-05 04:02:28	@PikFan	just give it a ton of chrons, then
2015-11-05 04:02:29	ScruffyChat	There'd be one space where, if grass had died around it, it'd still be healthy, for example
2015-11-05 04:02:52	@PikFan	its time would speed up and then return to normal
2015-11-05 04:03:35	@PikFan	the way I see it, the number of chrons interacting with particles determines how quickly it "updates"
2015-11-05 04:03:35	ScruffyChat	Interesting
2015-11-05 04:03:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-05 04:03:57	@PikFan	*how quickly they "update"
2015-11-05 04:04:07	@PikFan	I need to remember to use correct grammar
2015-11-05 04:04:25	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-05 04:05:33	@PikFan	as for knowing how to update... well, let's say an information "bubble" forms around the anomaly
2015-11-05 04:05:47	<--	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-11-05 04:05:55	Nvortex	wait a second are chrons particles?
2015-11-05 04:05:57	Nvortex	that small
2015-11-05 04:06:00	@PikFan	this information is trying to go to the anomaly, but since there aren't any chrons, the information just builds up
2015-11-05 04:06:09	@PikFan	yeah, chrons are the smallest particles
2015-11-05 04:06:11	Nvortex	they are supposed to affect time in a space not in matter
2015-11-05 04:06:12	@PikFan	smaller than quarks
2015-11-05 04:06:44	@PikFan	well
2015-11-05 04:07:10	@PikFan	basically, when a chron hits another particle, it tells that particle to update itself
2015-11-05 04:07:21	@PikFan	so it's basically like a frame
2015-11-05 04:07:41	@PikFan	the whole universe is a series of frames
2015-11-05 04:07:56	@PikFan	but in order to go from one frame to the next, you need chrons
2015-11-05 04:08:21	@PikFan	and without chrons, the frame doesn't update
2015-11-05 04:08:28	@PikFan	which appears as an anomaly
2015-11-05 04:09:57	ScruffyChat	That must mean that the converse is true
2015-11-05 04:10:05	ScruffyChat	That matter also affects chrons
2015-11-05 04:10:29	Nvortex	i will just stop thinking about this because by affecting space, that means that earths rotation, translation, the suns orbit an the galaxy's movement would make an anomaly pass through earth leaving everything completely barren
2015-11-05 04:10:55	@PikFan	oh, good point
2015-11-05 04:11:11	@PikFan	the anomaly wouldn't travel with the planet
2015-11-05 04:11:17	Nvortex	exactly
2015-11-05 04:11:18	@PikFan	oh dear
2015-11-05 04:11:28	Nvortex	and what if it were to pass on a giant point in space
2015-11-05 04:11:34	Nvortex	good bye earth
2015-11-05 04:11:46	Nvortex	and a good chunk of stars in the galaxy
2015-11-05 04:11:57	@PikFan	you mean a giant anomaly?
2015-11-05 04:12:01	Nvortex	yes
2015-11-05 04:12:23	@PikFan	well, it's assumed that all the anomalies are small for now
2015-11-05 04:12:24	Nvortex	now you are thiking on putting a time limit
2015-11-05 04:12:27	Nvortex	oh
2015-11-05 04:12:37	@PikFan	keywords: for now
2015-11-05 04:12:39	En_Passant	Nvortex has a point, even on a small scale
2015-11-05 04:12:51	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2015-11-05 04:12:52	Nvortex	i thought you were about to say, time limit before earth passes through a giant one
2015-11-05 04:13:03	@PikFan	I'm trying to think of how to work around this
2015-11-05 04:13:19	@PikFan	because the matter does get left behind, since it has no time anymore
2015-11-05 04:13:23	Nvortex	well i gtg to sleep
2015-11-05 04:13:28	@PikFan	alright, night
2015-11-05 04:13:29	Nvortex	see you tomorow i guess
2015-11-05 04:13:34	@PikFan	thanks for pointing out the flaws
2015-11-05 04:13:44	Nvortex	will you be here tomorrow?
2015-11-05 04:13:45	ScruffyChat	night
2015-11-05 04:13:49	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2015-11-05 04:13:50	@PikFan	probably
2015-11-05 04:13:52	Nvortex	ok
2015-11-05 04:13:53	Nvortex	bye
2015-11-05 04:13:55	@PikFan	bye
2015-11-05 04:13:56	ScruffyChat	bye
2015-11-05 04:13:58	<--	Nvortex (Mibbit@189.158.mqz.qxw) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-11-05 04:14:23	@PikFan	okay, so a part of the ground loses its chrons, so its time stops
2015-11-05 04:14:32	@PikFan	but since its time stops, its movement also stops
2015-11-05 04:14:43	En_Passant	It immediately has to phase through something
2015-11-05 04:14:44	@PikFan	and accounting for the movement of the earth, it gets left behind
2015-11-05 04:17:13	@PikFan	uuuuhhhhhhhhh
2015-11-05 04:18:30	@PikFan	blech
2015-11-05 04:18:59	@PikFan	...the matter gets left behind, forming an empty space in its wake
2015-11-05 04:19:24	ScruffyChat	But as the Earth rotates, the mass inside the anomaly accumulates
2015-11-05 04:19:34	ScruffyChat	Like a black hole that lets Earth do all the wrok
2015-11-05 04:19:36	ScruffyChat	work(
2015-11-05 04:20:03	@PikFan	but no, it wouldn't even stay on Earth, because of the Earth's orbit
2015-11-05 04:20:09	@PikFan	it just floats in space
2015-11-05 04:20:31	ScruffyChat	To Olimar and Pikmin, it would appear to move away very quickly
2015-11-05 04:20:36	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 04:20:44	En_Passant	How could you get that back?
2015-11-05 04:20:49	@PikFan	that's the thing
2015-11-05 04:20:52	@PikFan	I don't know
2015-11-05 04:21:01	@PikFan	because this is like throwing something out of a car
2015-11-05 04:21:05	@PikFan	while the car's moving
2015-11-05 04:21:35	@PikFan	the car isn't going to turn around so you can get what it is that you threw out
2015-11-05 04:22:31	ScruffyChat	By the way, I'm uploading a quick concept I threw together of cover art, just as an idea, not as a final
2015-11-05 04:22:42	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-05 04:22:57	@PikFan	oh dear... this idea is falling apart very fast
2015-11-05 04:23:08	@PikFan	two major flaws
2015-11-05 04:23:54	@PikFan	...I'm really tempted to have Nintendo logic fill in the holes (heh, "holes") but something tells me I shouldn't do that
2015-11-05 04:24:37	ScruffyChat	oh, yeah, try and ground it in science, it makes you feel much better about your game
2015-11-05 04:24:44	ScruffyChat	I can attest
2015-11-05 04:25:05	@PikFan	I can't tell if you were being sarcastic or if you were being serious lol
2015-11-05 04:25:16	ScruffyChat	Oh hehe sorry
2015-11-05 04:25:19	ScruffyChat	I was serious
2015-11-05 04:25:24	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-05 04:25:26	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-11-05 04:25:40	ScruffyChat	Anyway, I have a suggestion about chrons
2015-11-05 04:25:44	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-11-05 04:25:58	ScruffyChat	As I said before, they affect matter, but matter also affects them
2015-11-05 04:26:07	@PikFan	right, I was going to ask
2015-11-05 04:26:16	@PikFan	how would matter affect them?
2015-11-05 04:27:46	ScruffyChat	In the many-worlds theorem, it's suggested that the smallest quantum particles undergo changes based on probability that is determinant of choice
2015-11-05 04:27:52	ScruffyChat	As in, our choices
2015-11-05 04:28:15	ScruffyChat	So that even the observation of time has an effect on time itself
2015-11-05 04:28:26	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-11-05 04:28:43	@PikFan	like how observing an electron changes its properties?
2015-11-05 04:28:50	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-11-05 04:28:53	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-05 04:29:03	ScruffyChat	But, thinking about it dimensionally
2015-11-05 04:29:19	ScruffyChat	We would perceive the electron moving through the 4th dimension since it changes
2015-11-05 04:29:55	ScruffyChat	When, because the changes are changing based on our observation of them, it could be said the electron is branching off in the 5th dimension
2015-11-05 04:30:25	ScruffyChat	Instead of time following a line, it follows a jagged shape through the branches of timeline we choose
2015-11-05 04:30:27	@PikFan	by 4th dimension, are you referring to time, and by 5th dimension, are you referring to the 4th spatial dimension?
2015-11-05 04:30:58	ScruffyChat	4th dimension is our timeline, 5th dimension is all possible timelines that our timeline can become
2015-11-05 04:31:22	ScruffyChat	and 6th dimension would be all timelines in our universe whether we can reach them now or not
2015-11-05 04:34:12	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm
2015-11-05 04:34:24	ScruffyChat	So chrons aren't necessarily moving in a "straight line"
2015-11-05 04:34:35	ScruffyChat	And secondly, gravity could affect them
2015-11-05 04:34:50	@PikFan	oh, true
2015-11-05 04:34:53	ScruffyChat	We don't fully understand gravity so there's plenty room for science fiction to step in
2015-11-05 04:35:10	@PikFan	objects with more mass have a larger gravity
2015-11-05 04:35:16	ScruffyChat	So, if the Earth gravity could magnetically hold chrons in place,
2015-11-05 04:35:25	ScruffyChat	Then it could hold a lack of chrons in place
2015-11-05 04:35:28	@PikFan	magnetically?
2015-11-05 04:35:44	ScruffyChat	Well, I mean gravity could hold them in the same local spot
2015-11-05 04:35:49	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-05 04:35:58	ScruffyChat	Like if there's one in China, gravity would keep it in Chinga
2015-11-05 04:36:00	ScruffyChat	China*
2015-11-05 04:36:07	@PikFan	I was worried that you were going to get electromagnetism involved in this
2015-11-05 04:36:22	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-05 04:36:49	@PikFan	objects with a higher mass have a higher gravity
2015-11-05 04:37:04	ScruffyChat	Because gravity does affect time, so wherever they are dimensionally, gravity exerts more control than time
2015-11-05 04:37:08	@PikFan	but objects with a higher mass also have more particles
2015-11-05 04:37:24	@PikFan	so these massive objects attract large numbers of chrons
2015-11-05 04:37:44	@PikFan	which in turn affects time surrounding the massive object
2015-11-05 04:38:42	ScruffyChat	right, but large objects actually dilate time
2015-11-05 04:38:53	ScruffyChat	being near heavy gravity makes time /slower/
2015-11-05 04:39:31	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-05 04:39:32	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-05 04:40:27	@PikFan	how about this: because the object is attracting so many chrons so it can update itself, the chrons aren't able to update smaller objects around it
2015-11-05 04:40:42	@PikFan	as such, time is slower
2015-11-05 04:41:00	ScruffyChat	I suppose so
2015-11-05 04:41:15	ScruffyChat	But that suggests that time is object-based, not space-based
2015-11-05 04:42:10	ScruffyChat	I had a second idea
2015-11-05 04:42:31	@PikFan	I'm trying to wrap my head around this
2015-11-05 04:42:35	@PikFan	and okay
2015-11-05 04:42:49	ScruffyChat	Instead of chrons, if you want to hear that
2015-11-05 04:43:08	@PikFan	sure, I'm all ears
2015-11-05 04:43:23	@PikFan	would it be a wave...?
2015-11-05 04:43:30	En_Passant	This seems like a lot of effort to justify an idea a 13-year-old came up with
2015-11-05 04:43:40	@PikFan	15
2015-11-05 04:43:55	En_Passant	I thought you had this idea a couple of years ago
2015-11-05 04:44:02	@PikFan	...oh, er, yes
2015-11-05 04:44:05	@PikFan	never mind
2015-11-05 04:44:25	@PikFan	well, what's the harm? it's a learning process
2015-11-05 04:44:47	ScruffyChat	I was thinking it could be wormholes, greatly enlarged wormholes that plague the surface of PNF-404
2015-11-05 04:45:09	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-11-05 04:45:13	ScruffyChat	Pikmin and leaders do not survive the wormhole journey
2015-11-05 04:45:32	@PikFan	okay, sure, that's more plausible
2015-11-05 04:45:53	ScruffyChat	And all the while the wormholes are emitting Hawking radiation, which puts a real non-relative time limit to your actions
2015-11-05 04:46:08	@PikFan	right
2015-11-05 04:46:09	ScruffyChat	Before the energy circulating in the wormholes becomes to strong for matter to bear
2015-11-05 04:46:18	@PikFan	where do the wormholes go?
2015-11-05 04:46:25	ScruffyChat	It doesn't matter
2015-11-05 04:47:14	ScruffyChat	Unless you get some sort of device or upgrade that allows you to survive it
2015-11-05 04:47:29	ScruffyChat	In which case they go from a hazard to a gameplay mechanic
2015-11-05 04:47:33	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-05 04:47:37	ScruffyChat	And you warp small distances
2015-11-05 04:47:41	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 04:47:53	@PikFan	what would this have to do with time, though?
2015-11-05 04:48:22	@PikFan	if it's wormholes eating up the universe, then it's affecting reality itself
2015-11-05 04:48:26	ScruffyChat	Wormholes are 4-dimensional, you can't jump through space unless you use spacetime
2015-11-05 04:48:45	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-05 04:48:48	ScruffyChat	Although it wouldn't be the end of time per se
2015-11-05 04:48:51	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-11-05 04:48:55	ScruffyChat	The end of earth though
2015-11-05 04:49:42	@PikFan	guh
2015-11-05 04:50:37	@PikFan	I'm still not understanding
2015-11-05 04:50:42	ScruffyChat	But yeah, remember that image you showed me? of a CG representation of a wormhole
2015-11-05 04:50:55	@PikFan	yeah, what about it?
2015-11-05 04:51:06	ScruffyChat	That's what I'm imagining
2015-11-05 04:51:11	ScruffyChat	Populating the world
2015-11-05 04:51:16	ScruffyChat	Radiating excess energy
2015-11-05 04:51:31	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-05 04:51:36	ScruffyChat	And Pikmin can't survive a journey through one
2015-11-05 04:52:18	ScruffyChat	I don't know, just a thought
2015-11-05 04:52:29	ScruffyChat	time-based plots are difficult to understand
2015-11-05 04:52:32	@PikFan	wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but Hawking radiation is the result of virtual particles forming near an event horizon, but one of the particles is sucked into the horizon... right?
2015-11-05 04:52:43	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-05 04:52:45	@PikFan	and the other particle escapes
2015-11-05 04:52:47	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-05 04:52:50	ScruffyChat	Mhm
2015-11-05 04:52:58	ScruffyChat	So they no longer cancel each other
2015-11-05 04:53:02	@PikFan	right
2015-11-05 04:53:06	ScruffyChat	And thus are no longer virtual
2015-11-05 04:53:16	@PikFan	hm, but I thought that wormholes don't have event horizons...
2015-11-05 04:53:29	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2015-11-05 04:53:37	ScruffyChat	WAIT
2015-11-05 04:53:43	ScruffyChat	it wasn't hawking radiation
2015-11-05 04:53:48	ScruffyChat	it was radiation feedback
2015-11-05 04:54:03	ScruffyChat	like sound from an amplifier reaching a microphone
2015-11-05 04:54:30	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-05 04:54:48	@PikFan	/oh/
2015-11-05 04:54:55	@PikFan	well, that sounds disastrous
2015-11-05 04:54:58	ScruffyChat	In a tunnel of folded spacetime, radiation can loop in a feedback cycle
2015-11-05 04:55:41	ScruffyChat	Yes, it does sound disastrous
2015-11-05 04:56:30	@PikFan	okay, so this is how I think of a wormhole, except everything is one dimension higher: http://i.space.com/images/i/000/028/510/i02/shutterstock_25016035.jpg?1367271990
2015-11-05 04:57:03	@PikFan	in other words, 3D space bent through 4D hyperspace
2015-11-05 04:57:23	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-11-05 04:57:47	@PikFan	so radiation produced by these wormholes would be racing back and forth until it was lethal?
2015-11-05 04:57:52	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-05 04:57:57	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-05 04:58:05	ScruffyChat	Or until it corrupts the wormhole and it collapses
2015-11-05 04:58:12	ScruffyChat	Which could be catastrophic
2015-11-05 04:59:14	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-05 04:59:15	@PikFan	brb
2015-11-05 04:59:54	ScruffyChat	ok
2015-11-05 05:03:06	@PikFan	back
2015-11-05 05:03:27	ScruffyChat	hi
2015-11-05 05:03:28	@PikFan	okay, so you mentioned that time is still involved because you're bending the spacetime continuum
2015-11-05 05:03:36	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-05 05:03:56	ScruffyChat	although, you're not affecting the causality of time
2015-11-05 05:04:08	ScruffyChat	You're just using space to travel in zero time
2015-11-05 05:04:46	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-05 05:05:09	@PikFan	why does time have to be confusing
2015-11-05 05:05:29	@PikFan	then again, I brought this on myself, I was the one who wanted to play with timw
2015-11-05 05:05:31	@PikFan	*time
2015-11-05 05:06:45	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-05 05:06:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, when you mess with time, time messes with your head
2015-11-05 05:07:15	ScruffyChat	At least you're not getting into a time /travel/ story
2015-11-05 05:07:22	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-05 05:07:39	ScruffyChat	I mean unless you want to, there's nothing wrong with it
2015-11-05 05:07:56	@PikFan	I still want to go with chrons, because of creator's bias, but your idea's good to
2015-11-05 05:08:31	@PikFan	and then I have a disclaimer on the page saying "Such and such will be ignored in order to keep the game as simple as possible."
2015-11-05 05:08:41	@PikFan	*idea's good too
2015-11-05 05:09:03	ScruffyChat	Heh yeah
2015-11-05 05:09:07	ScruffyChat	I like chrons as well
2015-11-05 05:09:16	@PikFan	because at the end of the day, most people are mainly focusing on the gameplay element, not so much the physics behind it, I think
2015-11-05 05:09:21	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-05 05:09:30	ScruffyChat	Well, not for Onion moons, though
2015-11-05 05:09:40	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-05 05:09:56	@PikFan	maybe in an alternate universe with different physical laws
2015-11-05 05:10:20	@PikFan	physics is both fun and complicated
2015-11-05 05:10:28	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah
2015-11-05 05:10:31	ScruffyChat	that could happen
2015-11-05 05:10:48	@PikFan	this is how I think about alternate universes:
2015-11-05 05:10:58	ScruffyChat	There are most likely other universes with other laws of physics
2015-11-05 05:11:03	@PikFan	the further away it is from ours, the more different it is
2015-11-05 05:11:05	@PikFan	oh yes
2015-11-05 05:12:08	ScruffyChat	I mean, Pikmin could really exist somewhere out there
2015-11-05 05:12:27	ScruffyChat	If the fundamental constants at the Big Bang were correct
2015-11-05 05:13:21	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-05 05:15:16	ScruffyChat	I have to get going
2015-11-05 05:15:19	ScruffyChat	It's late

2015-11-07 02:04:33	@PikFan	aaaaaah, I want them to make a feature-length Pikmin movie
2015-11-07 02:04:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 02:05:04	ScruffyChat	Whenever I think about it though, I don't know how they would tell a story that's not a series of episodes
2015-11-07 02:05:18	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-11-07 02:05:39	@PikFan	maybe they could do like the Pikmin's point of view of P3?
2015-11-07 02:06:03	ScruffyChat	Maybe
2015-11-07 02:06:22	ScruffyChat	I wish I had the Pikmin short movies, I need to see the liberties they take with Pikmin characters
2015-11-07 02:06:46	@PikFan	oh, you don't have them?

2015-11-07 02:10:19	@PikFan	say, where did the picture in the background come from?
2015-11-07 02:11:18	ScruffyChat	There's a website called HDRILabs with an archive of free images
2015-11-07 02:11:34	ScruffyChat	The thing is, the image is a special type called an HDRI
2015-11-07 02:11:35	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-07 02:12:00	@PikFan	what does HDRI mean
2015-11-07 02:12:09	@PikFan	high defintion... rendered... image?
2015-11-07 02:12:14	ScruffyChat	Normally with images like JPG and PNG the whitest colors can only reach a certain brightness
2015-11-07 02:12:45	ScruffyChat	HDRI is "high dynamic range image"
2015-11-07 02:13:00	ScruffyChat	Which means that the image contains data about where light is coming from
2015-11-07 02:13:12	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-07 02:13:18	@PikFan	well, I got it half right
2015-11-07 02:13:27	ScruffyChat	If you turn down the brightness in an HDRI of a field, for example, you'll still see the sun
2015-11-07 02:13:40	ScruffyChat	Even after 300% darker, for instance
2015-11-07 02:14:01	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-11-07 02:14:32	ScruffyChat	The HDRI still knows that the sun's pixels are a higher brightness than just 255 255 255 color
2015-11-07 02:14:57	@PikFan	right
2015-11-07 02:15:02	ScruffyChat	So (recently I figured out) I can put that into Blender's render engine called Cycles
2015-11-07 02:15:11	ScruffyChat	And it can use that light data to light a scene
2015-11-07 02:15:13	@PikFan	hmm, why are all these HDRI images panoramas
2015-11-07 02:15:28	ScruffyChat	HDRIs are normally used as backgrounds for scenes
2015-11-07 02:15:41	ScruffyChat	So they are mapped on a spherical world
2015-11-07 02:15:48	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-07 02:16:16	@PikFan	and neat
2015-11-07 02:16:18	ScruffyChat	The Crushblat image, for example, has a 360 panoramic background of a basketball court in a park
2015-11-07 02:16:22	@PikFan	at the Cycles bit
2015-11-07 02:16:29	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-07 02:16:46	ScruffyChat	And the whole scene is lit by the sun /in the image/; there's no fake sunlight lamp
2015-11-07 02:17:01	@PikFan	that's awesome
2015-11-07 02:17:10	ScruffyChat	Yeah! It's so much fun
2015-11-07 02:17:22	ScruffyChat	The only problem is HDRI files are huge
2015-11-07 02:17:34	@PikFan	like, Cycles knows that the sun is the source of light, not just a random blob of white? that's amazing
2015-11-07 02:17:44	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-07 02:17:49	@PikFan	how big?
2015-11-07 02:18:09	ScruffyChat	Right, and it doesn't have to be the sun, it just takes into account the light intensity of all parts of the image
2015-11-07 02:18:23	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-07 02:18:27	@PikFan	impressive
2015-11-07 02:18:31	ScruffyChat	For example, a really reflective red car might reflect some red onto objects in your scene
2015-11-07 02:18:41	ScruffyChat	It really makes it look like realistic light rays
2015-11-07 02:18:52	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-07 02:19:19	ScruffyChat	The image in this scene is 17.3 MB
2015-11-07 02:19:27	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-07 02:19:34	@PikFan	that's big
2015-11-07 02:19:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 02:20:04	ScruffyChat	It's at 3K resolution
2015-11-07 02:20:12	ScruffyChat	It has to be big to be accurate
2015-11-07 02:20:15	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-07 02:20:42	ScruffyChat	I'm so glad to have found it though
2015-11-07 02:20:50	@PikFan	oh, speaking of UHD stuff, NASA recently released a half hour video of the Sun in 4K
2015-11-07 02:21:14	@PikFan	in 10 different wavelengths of light, too
2015-11-07 02:21:58	ScruffyChat	Oh, wow
2015-11-07 02:22:27	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmbeLTHC_0
2015-11-07 02:25:47	ScruffyChat	It's beautiful
2015-11-07 02:25:53	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-07 02:25:54	ScruffyChat	So mottled
2015-11-07 02:26:17	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-07 02:26:17	ScruffyChat	Its magnetic field is a nightmare
2015-11-07 02:27:01	@PikFan	yeah, you can see its effects on the surface pretty clearly
2015-11-07 02:27:11	@PikFan	I wouldn't want to be near that
2015-11-07 02:27:28	@PikFan	coupled with the million degree streams of plasma and high gravity
2015-11-07 02:28:38	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2015-11-07 02:29:28	ScruffyChat	Hey, speaking of this astronomical stuff, any progress on chrons?
2015-11-07 02:29:50	@PikFan	no, not so much
2015-11-07 02:30:35	@PikFan	I just decided that I'll go along with their inconsistencies, as bad as they are
2015-11-07 02:31:14	@PikFan	perhaps...
2015-11-07 02:31:32	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-11-07 02:31:36	ScruffyChat	I mean, that's not bad
2015-11-07 02:31:45	@PikFan	well, considering that chrons update the fabric of reality itself
2015-11-07 02:32:14	@PikFan	then maybe small voids would form in the chunks of ground, since they get left behind
2015-11-07 02:32:21	ScruffyChat	And this reality is the strange world of Pikmin
2015-11-07 02:32:27	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-07 02:32:41	@PikFan	but, let's say that an "information bubble" forms around this void
2015-11-07 02:33:05	@PikFan	the information wants to go in, but it can't, since there's neither time or space there
2015-11-07 02:33:16	@PikFan	as such, that information bubble starts forming
2015-11-07 02:33:22	ScruffyChat	That's really interesting
2015-11-07 02:33:34	ScruffyChat	So there'd sort of be a glow around the void then
2015-11-07 02:33:41	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-07 02:33:53	@PikFan	and giving chrons to the information bubble would somehow restore the void...?
2015-11-07 02:34:15	@PikFan	restore the space, I mean
2015-11-07 02:34:19	@PikFan	and time
2015-11-07 02:34:32	ScruffyChat	Not necessarily, chrons would stay in the information bubble
2015-11-07 02:34:42	@PikFan	I'm not sure, I can't think of a practical way around it
2015-11-07 02:34:47	ScruffyChat	Now do chrons require time?
2015-11-07 02:34:52	ScruffyChat	Or are they above time
2015-11-07 02:35:15	@PikFan	I...
2015-11-07 02:35:16	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-07 02:35:26	@PikFan	not sure
2015-11-07 02:36:02	@PikFan	considering they're the quantum of time, I'm not sure that they need time, since, well, chrons ARE time
2015-11-07 02:36:19	@PikFan	I don't know
2015-11-07 02:36:47	@PikFan	wait, I've got it
2015-11-07 02:37:20	@PikFan	this is also impractical, but the machine that "creates" chrons could also "create" the fabric of reality
2015-11-07 02:37:24	@PikFan	and hence, restore it
2015-11-07 02:37:35	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-11-07 02:37:57	@PikFan	but then, the whole point of chrons becomes kinda moot, if they depend on the spacetime continuum
2015-11-07 02:38:14	ScruffyChat	Well if chrons are time, then they aren't particles
2015-11-07 02:38:45	@PikFan	mm, yeah
2015-11-07 02:38:47	ScruffyChat	They may seem like particles in our 3D frame of reference, but they would be "hyper-particles"
2015-11-07 02:39:19	@PikFan	oh, so lapsing back and forth between our 3D space and a 4D hyperspace?
2015-11-07 02:39:31	ScruffyChat	So a void for chrons would be a hole in the 4-dimensional chron-body
2015-11-07 02:39:49	ScruffyChat	Like if all chrons formed a big block of swiss cheese
2015-11-07 02:40:01	--	Pi is now known as slpi
2015-11-07 02:40:17	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-07 02:40:19	ScruffyChat	And our 3D frame traveling through this cheese encountered a hole
2015-11-07 02:40:31	ScruffyChat	The hole would be a sphere
2015-11-07 02:40:54	ScruffyChat	And it would grow to a maximum size and shrink as we passed the hole in the cheese
2015-11-07 02:40:55	@PikFan	right
2015-11-07 02:41:52	ScruffyChat	But yeah, I don't know if chrons should be particles at all
2015-11-07 02:41:59	@PikFan	like you said, if I try to mess with time, time messes with my head
2015-11-07 02:42:01	ScruffyChat	But maybe an overall 4D shape
2015-11-07 02:42:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 02:42:14	@PikFan	who knows
2015-11-07 02:43:11	@PikFan	okay, let's just say that the "time" aspect of the spacetime continuum is disappearing
2015-11-07 02:43:27	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-11-07 02:43:44	ScruffyChat	So in some parts of space, 3d objects are no longer moving in the "duration" direction
2015-11-07 02:43:48	@PikFan	because time, as Wikipedia defines it, "is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future"
2015-11-07 02:43:55	@PikFan	in other words, a sequence of events
2015-11-07 02:43:59	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-07 02:44:09	ScruffyChat	But time can also be considered a direction
2015-11-07 02:44:18	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-07 02:44:21	ScruffyChat	At right angles to the 3rd dimension of height
2015-11-07 02:44:39	ScruffyChat	Forward in time (+4d) is future
2015-11-07 02:44:46	ScruffyChat	Backward (-4d) is past
2015-11-07 02:44:50	@PikFan	perpendicular to the other dimensions? 
2015-11-07 02:44:50	ScruffyChat	to us
2015-11-07 02:44:58	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-07 02:45:02	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-07 02:45:27	ScruffyChat	If the 3 spatial dimension are all considered a point
2015-11-07 02:45:38	ScruffyChat	Then time is the line on which it can move
2015-11-07 02:46:50	@PikFan	that's how I think of the universe
2015-11-07 02:47:23	@PikFan	I think of a bunch of universes all on a line, and our frame of reference for time is just moving along this line
2015-11-07 02:47:45	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 02:48:24	ScruffyChat	Of course, it's probably not a straight line, which suggests a 5th dimension
2015-11-07 02:48:36	ScruffyChat	But that's more than we need for PEOT
2015-11-07 02:48:59	@PikFan	well yeah, but I was just using dimensional analogy
2015-11-07 02:49:07	@PikFan	but I didn't make that clear...
2015-11-07 02:49:22	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-11-07 02:53:03	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-07 02:53:37	@PikFan	since time is disappearing from the spacetime continuum, nothing will happen anymore, and the entire universe will freeze over
2015-11-07 02:53:49	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-07 02:53:53	ScruffyChat	Is that bad?
2015-11-07 02:54:05	@PikFan	in their point of view... yes
2015-11-07 02:54:28	@PikFan	erm, the Hocotatians', I mean
2015-11-07 02:54:42	ScruffyChat	I guess so
2015-11-07 02:55:06	ScruffyChat	But I feel like they should realize that they, as members of the universe, should run with it
2015-11-07 02:55:08	@PikFan	but not in the villain's point of view, which is why they're trying to accomplish it
2015-11-07 02:55:35	@PikFan	uh...
2015-11-07 02:56:14	@PikFan	so... you're saying they should give up? that's how I'm interpreting your statement
2015-11-07 02:56:27	ScruffyChat	I don't know
2015-11-07 02:56:54	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-07 02:57:07	@PikFan	IMO I feel like they wouldn't give up
2015-11-07 02:57:19	ScruffyChat	If I found out time was ending forever I would just go with it, we would never know that time had stopped anyway
2015-11-07 02:57:19	@PikFan	besides they're more advanced than humans, so...
2015-11-07 02:57:27	ScruffyChat	Oh, that's true
2015-11-07 02:57:41	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-07 02:57:52	@PikFan	that kinda feels like ignorance is bliss, though
2015-11-07 02:57:53	ScruffyChat	But time could be stopping for "years" at a time, we wouldn't feel it at all
2015-11-07 02:57:58	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-07 02:58:40	@PikFan	anyway, philosophy aside, we can just simplify this by saying that time is literally running out
2015-11-07 02:59:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 02:59:20	@PikFan	but I think I'll incorporate your points into the villain's ideology
2015-11-07 02:59:32	@PikFan	they are valid points
2015-11-07 02:59:42	ScruffyChat	And, with Hocotatian technology, they think they can keep time going
2015-11-07 02:59:49	@PikFan	right
2015-11-07 02:59:50	ScruffyChat	Because they have a right to continue
2015-11-07 02:59:55	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-07 03:00:40	@PikFan	I mean, if the Chronos Reactor is able to harness the STC for energy, then why can't they do other things to manipulate it?
2015-11-07 03:01:00	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-07 03:01:29	@PikFan	if anything, their technology has probably advanced since Pikmin 1, anyway
2015-11-07 03:01:37	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-07 03:02:43	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2015-11-07 03:03:22	ScruffyChat	They can hold fruit in basically an finite but unbounded space
2015-11-07 03:04:38	@PikFan	right
2015-11-07 03:04:38	ScruffyChat	Or treasure
2015-11-07 03:05:06	@PikFan	"bigger on the inside" stuff always fascinates me
2015-11-07 03:05:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 03:06:08	ScruffyChat	My prologue movie ends with Olimar being beamed up into the Red Onion that saves him
2015-11-07 03:06:30	@PikFan	oh, yeah, I'd been meaning to ask about that
2015-11-07 03:06:35	@PikFan	why is he beamed into it?
2015-11-07 03:06:48	ScruffyChat	So he's saved from the fall
2015-11-07 03:06:58	ScruffyChat	I mean, I know he survived in Pikmin 1
2015-11-07 03:07:05	@PikFan	oh, so he's beamed into the Onion while falling
2015-11-07 03:07:10	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-07 03:07:14	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-07 03:08:55	ScruffyChat	But I'm thinking that inside the Onion is information that Olimar can't comprehend, like, ever
2015-11-07 03:09:16	@PikFan	information?
2015-11-07 03:09:36	@PikFan	I mean, I get that the Onions are hyperintelligent fruit
2015-11-07 03:09:53	@PikFan	but information is presented to him? like... telepathy?
2015-11-07 03:10:24	ScruffyChat	By information I just mean stuff that can be observed
2015-11-07 03:10:29	ScruffyChat	Sights, sounds
2015-11-07 03:10:34	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-07 03:10:39	ScruffyChat	They're too complex to be comprehended
2015-11-07 03:10:46	@PikFan	mhm, yes
2015-11-07 03:10:53	@PikFan	like, give an example
2015-11-07 03:11:28	ScruffyChat	The sight of a space that is finite, but can contain an infinite number of Pikmin
2015-11-07 03:11:43	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-07 03:11:52	ScruffyChat	all arranged in a line in which there is infintessimally little space between Pikmin
2015-11-07 03:12:41	@PikFan	yeah, I don't think I would be able to understand that, either
2015-11-07 03:12:44	@PikFan	but it is simple
2015-11-07 03:12:52	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-07 03:13:08	@PikFan	as compared to the Onions in Mysterious World
2015-11-07 03:13:09	ScruffyChat	Perhaps it's just so much matter in one space that it becomes to bright to be seen
2015-11-07 03:13:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-07 03:13:34	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-07 03:13:43	ScruffyChat	Whatever it is, I felt that you would have Olimar's point of view as he's beamed at the end of the prologue
2015-11-07 03:13:50	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-07 03:13:53	ScruffyChat	As you entered it would fade withe
2015-11-07 03:13:55	ScruffyChat	white*
2015-11-07 03:14:05	ScruffyChat	And the title would appear from that
2015-11-07 03:14:08	@PikFan	by the way, how's it going?
2015-11-07 03:14:10	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-07 03:14:29	ScruffyChat	I believe there are three shots left to shoot
2015-11-07 03:14:39	ScruffyChat	Wait, four
2015-11-07 03:15:15	@PikFan	so it's pretty close to completion, then?
2015-11-07 03:15:41	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-07 03:15:57	@PikFan	yay
2015-11-07 03:16:03	@PikFan	how long is it?
2015-11-07 03:16:39	ScruffyChat	Let me check
2015-11-07 03:18:05	ScruffyChat	It'll be around 2 minutes
2015-11-07 03:18:36	@PikFan	ooh
2015-11-07 03:20:12	ScruffyChat	It's crazy how much goes into 2 minutes of footage
2015-11-07 03:20:37	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-07 03:20:47	@PikFan	what can we expect quality-wise?
2015-11-07 03:21:11	ScruffyChat	And unfortunately, it will be a little under the normal render quality I use in images
2015-11-07 03:21:19	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-07 03:21:23	@PikFan	that's fine
2015-11-07 03:21:39	@PikFan	but I mean, will it be in the style of animated movies, or...?
2015-11-07 03:21:48	ScruffyChat	I still think it's good image quality, but I had to cut some corners to decrease render times
2015-11-07 03:22:01	ScruffyChat	It's sort of like the style of the P2 intro cutscene
2015-11-07 03:22:01	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-07 03:22:12	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-07 03:22:23	ScruffyChat	A stylized introduction and then a CG rendered depiction of the action
2015-11-07 03:22:56	@PikFan	right
2015-11-07 03:23:06	ScruffyChat	But all narrated with voiceover
2015-11-07 03:23:23	ScruffyChat	I'm doing my best to emulate P3's narrator
2015-11-07 03:23:35	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-07 03:23:35	ScruffyChat	Well not all of it
2015-11-07 03:24:27	ScruffyChat	I'd have to show you to demonstrate what I'm talking about
2015-11-07 03:24:53	@PikFan	right
2015-11-07 03:24:58	@PikFan	but it's not ready
2015-11-07 03:25:05	@PikFan	so I'll just have to wait and see
2015-11-07 03:25:12	ScruffyChat	Sorry :/
2015-11-07 03:25:18	@PikFan	it's fine
2015-11-07 03:25:55	ScruffyChat	Rendering is straightforward, once I have it planned out it goes by smoothly
2015-11-07 03:26:02	ScruffyChat	Even more so with composing music
2015-11-07 03:26:04	ScruffyChat	but sound
2015-11-07 03:26:09	ScruffyChat	Sound is a problem
2015-11-07 03:26:22	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-07 03:26:23	ScruffyChat	I'm going to take a few sounds from P1 and P2
2015-11-07 03:26:25	ScruffyChat	As homag
2015-11-07 03:26:27	ScruffyChat	homage*
2015-11-07 03:26:32	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-07 03:26:49	ScruffyChat	But a lot of the generic sounds I need will be difficult to procure
2015-11-07 03:27:19	@PikFan	mmm
2015-11-07 03:27:24	ScruffyChat	Spacecraft sounds for example, they're hard to come by for free
2015-11-07 03:27:41	ScruffyChat	Unless I rip them from some other spacecraft sound
2015-11-07 03:28:30	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-11-07 03:28:38	@PikFan	no help from me, sorry...
2015-11-07 03:28:50	ScruffyChat	It's no trouble
2015-11-07 03:28:58	ScruffyChat	I will finish it, one way or another
2015-11-07 03:29:16	ScruffyChat	It's looking good, I'm liking it so far
2015-11-07 03:29:29	@PikFan	that's good
2015-11-07 03:30:16	ScruffyChat	Thank you for reminding me of it, I have a few finished shots that I haven't added to the film yet
2015-11-07 03:30:33	@PikFan	no problem

2015-11-07 03:35:58	Nvortex	have you come with some explanation to make your chron mechanic work?
2015-11-07 03:36:24	@PikFan	I decided I won't be using chrons
2015-11-07 03:36:54	@PikFan	instead, I'll just say that time is disappearing from the spacetime continuum

2015-11-07 03:39:57	Nvortex	i want to say something but i dont want to make you change your mind again
2015-11-07 03:40:12	Nvortex	regarding the no time space
2015-11-07 03:40:16	Nvortex	on earth
2015-11-07 03:40:26	@PikFan	well, what is it?
2015-11-07 03:40:33	Nvortex	what happens with the air
2015-11-07 03:40:56	Nvortex	the air on earth
2015-11-07 03:41:00	@PikFan	well, it's still space, so like anything else caught in that field, it freezes
2015-11-07 03:41:08	Nvortex	exactly...
2015-11-07 03:41:22	@PikFan	but the rest of the air is fine
2015-11-07 03:41:25	Nvortex	if air keeps blowing, earth will end up having no air
2015-11-07 03:41:32	Nvortex	storms, wind storms
2015-11-07 03:41:38	Nvortex	regular days
2015-11-07 03:41:42	@PikFan	oh, I see what you mean
2015-11-07 03:42:11	@PikFan	you think that the air will fly into the anomaly and freeze
2015-11-07 03:42:16	Nvortex	yes
2015-11-07 03:42:26	@PikFan	well, that won't happen
2015-11-07 03:42:30	Nvortex	ok
2015-11-07 03:42:51	@PikFan	there's a barrier-like thing surrounding the anomaly that prevents things from getting in or out
2015-11-07 03:43:06	@PikFan	well, just from getting in, really
2015-11-07 03:43:51	Nvortex	maybe getting rid of the anomalies can help solve some puzzles
2015-11-07 03:44:10	Nvortex	like you need a section to have them and another one to be free of them
2015-11-07 03:44:20	@PikFan	yeah, that's what Scruffy and I discussed
2015-11-07 03:44:22	Nvortex	so something can pass or cant pass
2015-11-07 03:45:28	@PikFan	there's this machine that fixes anomalies
2015-11-07 03:45:34	Nvortex	then that means that anomalies arent black anymore?
2015-11-07 03:45:58	@PikFan	how many times you can use this machine is dependent on the amount of resources you've collected so far
2015-11-07 03:46:04	@PikFan	oh, they're still black
2015-11-07 03:46:16	Nvortex	if there some sort of time wall around it, it would be like looking through a black hole or a glass
2015-11-07 03:46:43	@PikFan	well, since there's no time, photons can't get out
2015-11-07 03:46:51	@PikFan	therefore, it's black
2015-11-07 03:47:01	@PikFan	that's why black holes are black
2015-11-07 03:47:12	@PikFan	except that's gravity
2015-11-07 03:47:15	@PikFan	but I digress
2015-11-07 03:47:36	Nvortex	but you jsut said that theres something the prevents thing from coming in
2015-11-07 03:47:39	Nvortex	that includes photons
2015-11-07 03:47:55	Nvortex	that would also means that they are completely white
2015-11-07 03:48:14	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-07 03:48:41	Nvortex	it would be something like this

2015-11-07 03:50:38	Nvortex	Typically, the light rays falling on the object and reflected from the surface, fall into the human eye. This allows him to see this object. The new material is the same as it captures the rays of light and gently leads them around the object.

2015-11-07 03:56:47	@PikFan	how do you know?
2015-11-07 03:56:55	Nvortex	because of his edits
2015-11-07 03:57:19	@PikFan	uh, but it doesn't show his IP on the wiki
2015-11-07 03:57:35	Nvortex	He Writes Like This
2015-11-07 03:58:09	@PikFan	well yeah, but I fail to see how you got his IP
2015-11-07 03:58:51	Nvortex	what? that isnt his ip
2015-11-07 03:59:11	@PikFan	:\
2015-11-07 03:59:58	Nvortex	i checked on "recent changes", thats where i saw he was editing pikmin forever
2015-11-07 04:00:35	Nvortex	then i saw that that user was editing the page cayden created with the same editing manner
2015-11-07 04:01:36	ScruffyChat	Just added 11 seconds
2015-11-07 04:01:44	@PikFan	awesome
2015-11-07 04:02:04	ScruffyChat	But I realized that, because of the plot changes, I will have a few more scenes to create
2015-11-07 04:02:23	ScruffyChat	However, those scenes are at the beginning of the film, in a style that Blender renders very quickly
2015-11-07 04:02:39	@PikFan	Nvortex: wait, where? I haven't seen any IPs edit Pikmin Forever, even before I protected it
2015-11-07 04:02:45	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: oh, okay
2015-11-07 04:04:22	Nvortex	no i meant in case he starts editing on other pages
2015-11-07 04:04:38	@PikFan	I still don't understand how you got his IP...
2015-11-07 04:04:45	@PikFan	I mean, how do you know that's him?
2015-11-07 04:04:59	@PikFan	on the wiki I haven't seen any IP edits that remotely resemble his
2015-11-07 04:05:06	Nvortex	 <Nvortex>: i checked on "recent changes", thats where i saw he was editing pikmin forever <Nvortex>: then i saw that that user was editing the page cayden created with the same editing manner

2015-11-07 04:05:37	Nvortex	with the first message i mean back when he was cayden
2015-11-07 04:05:38	@PikFan	no IP edits
2015-11-07 04:06:06	ScruffyChat	Sorry if the pacing in this film is a little off as well
2015-11-07 04:06:13	ScruffyChat	But i can't afford to re-render some scenes
2015-11-07 04:06:21	Nvortex	i started checking recent changes continuously when he edited pikmin forever in case he started editing on other pages
2015-11-07 04:06:45	Nvortex	like after that edit, i started checking
2015-11-07 04:07:07	@PikFan	...OH, I SEE IT NOW

2015-11-07 04:08:34	@PikFan	copied PF again
2015-11-07 04:09:12	ScruffyChat	It's no big deal
2015-11-07 04:09:19	@PikFan	he also ignored my message to Stop Typing Like This
2015-11-07 04:09:22	ScruffyChat	It's not as bad as copy-pasting
2015-11-07 04:09:32	@PikFan	I guess
2015-11-07 04:10:04	@PikFan	oh, I forgot to tell him about the Pikspore stuff

2015-11-07 04:12:59	ScruffyChat	Imovie is interesting
2015-11-07 04:13:15	ScruffyChat	There are a lot of shortcomings that actually turn out to be advantages
2015-11-07 04:13:30	ScruffyChat	For example, normally a clip can't be shorter than 0.2 second
2015-11-07 04:13:46	@PikFan	brb
2015-11-07 04:13:56	ScruffyChat	but if you create a freeze-frame, it splits even a 0.2-second clip into 0.1 second clips
2015-11-07 04:14:00	ScruffyChat	Which is useful
2015-11-07 04:14:02	ScruffyChat	See ya
2015-11-07 04:14:16	Nvortex	how long will your video be?
2015-11-07 04:14:34	ScruffyChat	I'd estimate 2 to 2 and a half minutes
2015-11-07 04:15:47	ScruffyChat	1 second of footage has probably on average taken 30 to 60 minutes to create

2015-11-08 00:41:26	UltraMario	it gets progressively difficult since it's a work in progress remake of a full game :p

2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	you've probably never heard of it, but
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	Super Mario Bros. Special
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	i can give you some context on it if you want
2015-11-08 00:41:27	En_Passant	I might have seen it somewhere before
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	ooo
2015-11-08 00:41:27	En_Passant	But I don't know anything about it
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	it was a sequel to Super Mario Bros. made by Hudson Soft in 1986
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	before the lost levels, even
2015-11-08 00:41:27	UltraMario	to be perfectly honest lost levels gets too much credit. the levels i'm doing are actually lost ;P

2015-11-08 03:33:56	@PikFan	Scruffy, I think
2015-11-08 03:34:02	@PikFan	I was reading the logs some days ago
2015-11-08 03:34:16	@PikFan	so I'm pretty sure it was Scruffy
2015-11-08 03:34:48	@PikFan	didn't you turn them into an ant-like creature, or something like that?
2015-11-08 03:35:42	En_Passant	Yeah

2015-11-08 03:44:20	En_Passant	I'm thinking about how they should behave
2015-11-08 03:44:38	En_Passant	I think they'd be good as a non-elemental Dweevil replacement, but that's also not very ant-like
2015-11-08 03:45:09	@PikFan	sure it is
2015-11-08 03:45:17	@PikFan	ants carry things
2015-11-08 03:45:48	@PikFan	not on their backs, of course, but they still can carry things
2015-11-08 03:49:17	En_Passant	But they take them back to their colony
2015-11-08 03:49:54	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-08 03:50:02	@PikFan	are there Breadbugs in your game
2015-11-08 03:50:09	En_Passant	The cave in Savannah Wilds is an ant colony, so it'd be weird to have them elsewhere too
2015-11-08 03:50:10	En_Passant	And yes
2015-11-08 03:50:23	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-08 03:50:40	En_Passant	Breadbugs only live underground, though
2015-11-08 03:51:41	@PikFan	well, suppose the ant colony in the Savannah Wilds is larger than most others
2015-11-08 03:52:10	@PikFan	that way, you could have smaller, non-explorable ant colonies in other areas
2015-11-08 03:52:30	@PikFan	just an idea
2015-11-08 03:53:13	En_Passant	I guess I could
2015-11-08 03:53:20	En_Passant	You could raid them like dirt mounds
2015-11-08 03:53:27	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 03:53:32	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-11-08 03:53:38	@PikFan	weren't dirt mounds removed?
2015-11-08 03:53:41	En_Passant	No
2015-11-08 03:53:45	@PikFan	...oh
2015-11-08 03:53:47	En_Passant	They just only have bomb rocks now
2015-11-08 03:53:53	@PikFan	for some reason I thought — oh, okay
2015-11-08 03:54:01	@PikFan	that must be why I was confused
2015-11-08 03:54:17	En_Passant	Not that anything else they had in P3 was worth getting anyway, other than required Fragments
2015-11-08 03:54:29	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 03:55:01	@PikFan	I agree to raiding them like dirt mounts
2015-11-08 03:55:19	@PikFan	it's just better than having everything explode when you kill all the beebs

2015-11-08 03:55:37	@PikFan	well, "explode"
2015-11-08 03:55:52	@PikFan	because when you kill Breadbugs, all the things they stole "explode" out of their nest

2015-11-08 03:57:14	Nvortex	like a functoning creature in the pikmin universe?
2015-11-08 03:57:19	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 03:57:19	En_Passant	Yes
2015-11-08 03:57:52	Nvortex	i will have to read the beeb page so i can contribute
2015-11-08 03:58:19	Nvortex	every beeb type?
2015-11-08 03:58:28	En_Passant	Most of them
2015-11-08 03:58:49	En_Passant	Don't know if I'll do the Bladed ones
2015-11-08 03:59:12	Nvortex	bladed beebs are my favorite, i actually thought they were going to be in 3...im kinda glad they arent though
2015-11-08 03:59:34	En_Passant	I was thinking of maybe having a Bladed Beeb be the first region boss
2015-11-08 04:00:33	Nvortex	you can have the bombardier beeb not die, just "explode" in fire, regular beebs could act like a "sentinel beeb" which make all of the king beebs to wake up or atleast mke the other beeb types target you
2015-11-08 04:01:17	Nvortex	regular beebs could act like the dwarf bulborbs in pikmin 1
2015-11-08 04:01:23	Nvortex	thats what i meant with sentinel
2015-11-08 04:01:49	En_Passant	Dwarf Orange Bulborbs do that already lol
2015-11-08 04:02:00	Nvortex	maybe you could get in beeb colonies
2015-11-08 04:02:01	Nvortex	wot
2015-11-08 04:02:12	En_Passant	*do that in Pikmin V
2015-11-08 04:02:18	Nvortex	oh
2015-11-08 04:03:19	Nvortex	well all dwarf bulborbs are clone of each others so what about having a beeb dwarf bulborb clone
2015-11-08 04:03:35	En_Passant	I hate clones
2015-11-08 04:03:45	En_Passant	That's why I made Orange ones different
2015-11-08 04:03:55	Nvortex	regular bulborbs are clones of themselves too 
2015-11-08 04:03:59	Nvortex	aside from whiptongues
2015-11-08 04:04:16	En_Passant	And Oranges
2015-11-08 04:04:44	Nvortex	but only in pikmin v
2015-11-08 04:05:04	En_Passant	No, Orange Bulborbs have always been different
2015-11-08 04:05:21	En_Passant	They wake up when you get near them
2015-11-08 04:05:58	Nvortex	hairy bulborbs are faster, orange bulborbs wake up sooner, red bulborbs are the "weakest" but they all behave the same
2015-11-08 04:06:38	En_Passant	Hairy ones are faster?
2015-11-08 04:06:40	@PikFan	faster? that can't be right
2015-11-08 04:07:06	Nvortex	faster eaters
2015-11-08 04:08:19	Nvortex	or atleast thats what i remember
2015-11-08 04:08:25	Nvortex	been a while since i played 2
2015-11-08 04:08:46	Nvortex	i will have to test that some other time
2015-11-08 04:09:16	En_Passant	Maybe what I
2015-11-08 04:09:24	En_Passant	'll do is have two types of regular Beebs
2015-11-08 04:09:34	En_Passant	The ones in Savannah Wilds that carry back to the colony
2015-11-08 04:09:43	En_Passant	And another, larger kind that replcaes Dweevils
2015-11-08 04:10:11	Nvortex	do you ever get in the colony?
2015-11-08 04:10:25	En_Passant	Yes, it's a cave
2015-11-08 04:10:31	Nvortex	cool

2015-11-08 05:05:55	@PikFan	sure, what is it?
2015-11-08 05:06:14	Funky	Do you... need any help with information from Pikmin 3 for the wiki?

2015-11-08 05:08:13	Funky	Anyway wassup guys?
2015-11-08 05:08:52	En_Passant	Not much, thinking of enemy ideas for my Pikmin fangame
2015-11-08 05:09:16	Funky	A fangame? When you are done, you need to send me a link.
2015-11-08 05:10:13	Funky	Also if you guys have any tips, I would appreciate it. I'm kind of new to the whole pikmin scene. 
2015-11-08 05:10:38	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_V
2015-11-08 05:10:51	En_Passant	It doesn't have everything on it that I have on my information spreadsheet
2015-11-08 05:11:36	@PikFan	well, try not to do everything at once
2015-11-08 05:11:46	@PikFan	if you do things can get overwhelming
2015-11-08 05:11:58	UltraMario	>pikmin 5
2015-11-08 05:12:07	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 05:12:12	Funky	I have a bad habit of doing that
2015-11-08 05:12:17	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-08 05:12:31	@PikFan	well, just try to take it one fruit at a time
2015-11-08 05:12:43	Funky	Then I'll have that one dang yellow left in the arena of the meerslug because he couldn't carry the melon.
2015-11-08 05:14:46	Funky	Do you guys have any tips for challenge mode? It's really hard to platinum solo
2015-11-08 05:14:54	@PikFan	practice
2015-11-08 05:15:00	@PikFan	practice practice practice
2015-11-08 05:15:25	@PikFan	you definitely won't get platinum the first try
2015-11-08 05:15:38	@PikFan	</obvious>
2015-11-08 05:15:52	@PikFan	but yeah, you just gotta keep practicing the same level over and over again
2015-11-08 05:16:04	Funky	ugh, but it's soo hard
2015-11-08 05:16:18	Funky	Darn you Chuggaaconroy, for getting me into this game!
2015-11-08 05:18:02	Funky	Your claw Pikmin are creepy by the way, I don't know how I feel about them
2015-11-08 05:18:31	En_Passant	Creepy?
2015-11-08 05:19:13	Funky	Seeing pikmin with claws is disturbing. (to me)
2015-11-08 05:19:41	@PikFan	Chuggaa got you interested?
2015-11-08 05:20:15	Funky	Yeah, almost every game he has played I have bought. He just gets soo enthusiastic about the game that I have to try it.
2015-11-08 05:20:37	Funky	Happened with Xenoblade, Okami, Mario and Luigi.
2015-11-08 05:20:43	@PikFan	whatever you do, please try not to obsess over Steve
2015-11-08 05:20:53	Funky	MOOO
2015-11-08 05:21:02	@PikFan	tbh I greatly dislike Steve
2015-11-08 05:21:07	Funky	D:
2015-11-08 05:21:10	Funky	Why?
2015-11-08 05:21:17	Funky	But he's such a trooper
2015-11-08 05:21:25	@PikFan	I mean, it's not as common as it used to be
2015-11-08 05:21:53	@PikFan	but back in the day, so many Pikmin fans that were also Chuggaa fans were constantly obsessing over Steve
2015-11-08 05:22:08	@PikFan	and it just got really annoying and repetitive
2015-11-08 05:22:14	Funky	My favorites are blues, tbh
2015-11-08 05:22:32	@PikFan	so because of that, I just dislike Steve
2015-11-08 05:22:38	Funky	WOW
2015-11-08 05:22:53	Funky	You hate steve because people liked him.
2015-11-08 05:23:14	@PikFan	not really
2015-11-08 05:23:25	@PikFan	it's because of the way people were obsessing over him
2015-11-08 05:24:08	@PikFan	Chuggaa himself didn't expect that Steve would gain such a following
2015-11-08 05:24:28	Funky	Probably not
2015-11-08 05:24:45	Funky	But don't hate on steve, he doesn't deserve it.
2015-11-08 05:25:27	@PikFan	it was just so, so common
2015-11-08 05:25:54	@PikFan	everywhere I'd go, there'd be at least one thing about Steve
2015-11-08 05:25:57	@PikFan	Steve was everywhere
2015-11-08 05:26:16	Funky	Someone has a youtube account called Steve the Trooper and he comments moo on every vid.
2015-11-08 05:26:18	@PikFan	on the wiki, people kept trying to make pages devoted to Steve
2015-11-08 05:26:36	@PikFan	it was too much
2015-11-08 05:27:23	Funky	Really?
2015-11-08 05:27:25	Funky	wow
2015-11-08 05:27:38	Funky	Also you might want to see this fellow Chugga fan.
2015-11-08 05:27:41	Funky	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CR4FnepWEAApAkj.jpg
2015-11-08 05:27:52	@PikFan	I honestly don't mind the occasional fan that likes Steve
2015-11-08 05:28:16	@PikFan	it just gets annoying when a lot of people start worshipping him
2015-11-08 05:28:26	Funky	It kind of is
2015-11-08 05:28:45	Funky	En_passant
2015-11-08 05:28:58	Funky	Get back here
2015-11-08 05:29:13	En_Passant	no
2015-11-08 05:29:37	Funky	I am practicing digital art, if you want some concept art for your game, contact me.
2015-11-08 05:29:53	En_Passant	You should meet Scruffy
2015-11-08 05:29:57	En_Passant	He does modelling
2015-11-08 05:30:10	En_Passant	He's the one that made the game's logo
2015-11-08 05:30:34	Funky	oh, well if you don't need me. I just wanted a chance to show off my skill
2015-11-08 05:30:53	Funky	http://pre06.deviantart.net/f690/th/pre/i/2015/305/b/b/let_s_do_this_by_funkychunky00-d9f8g9h.jpg
2015-11-08 05:31:04	En_Passant	That's pretty good
2015-11-08 05:31:08	En_Passant	Better than mine
2015-11-08 05:31:22	En_Passant	hm
2015-11-08 05:31:25	Funky	And Pikmin are so easy to draw, all the pikmin guys are
2015-11-08 05:31:33	En_Passant	Actually, I think I have a request for you
2015-11-08 05:31:34	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-08 05:31:40	Funky	I wouldn't mind drawing them if you gave me a detailed description
2015-11-08 05:31:58	@PikFan	you could be the guy that specializes in 2D drawings
2015-11-08 05:32:09	Funky	bruh, I could
2015-11-08 05:32:14	Funky	I'd be honored
2015-11-08 05:33:00	Funky	How many of you guys would freak out if nintendo saw your ideas and implemented them in a future pikmin title
2015-11-08 05:33:18	En_Passant	All of us
2015-11-08 05:33:34	Funky	I'm rooting for you
2015-11-08 05:33:46	@PikFan	it'd be a dream come true
2015-11-08 05:34:12	@PikFan	funnily enough, before Pikmin 3 came out, somebody had a pink Pikmin that could fly in one of their fangames
2015-11-08 05:34:24	Funky	That's awesome
2015-11-08 05:35:13	En_Passant	Okay, so my request is the Iridescent Flint Beetle
2015-11-08 05:35:24	En_Passant	I redesigned it for my game in this drawing
2015-11-08 05:35:25	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Iridescent_Flint_Beetle_V.png
2015-11-08 05:35:29	UltraMario	owow
2015-11-08 05:35:41	En_Passant	And Scruffy made a model of it that looks much better
2015-11-08 05:35:42	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Pikmin_V_Iridescent_Flint_Beetle_FInal_by_Scruffy.png
2015-11-08 05:36:01	En_Passant	I've been wanting to remake the drawing to match the model
2015-11-08 05:36:05	En_Passant	But I haven't had time
2015-11-08 05:37:12	Funky	Dang scruffy is good
2015-11-08 05:37:32	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-11-08 05:37:49	En_Passant	The shell's a little bit too blue, but that's a Blender problem
2015-11-08 05:37:58	Funky	Jesus, why isn't he doing the drawing? lol
2015-11-08 05:38:24	En_Passant	I don't think he draws
2015-11-08 05:38:29	En_Passant	Just modelling
2015-11-08 05:39:22	@PikFan	he also did this http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/c/ce/Glassblat.png
2015-11-08 05:39:31	@PikFan	and this http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/e/e5/The_Impact_Site_by_Scruffy.png
2015-11-08 05:39:38	Funky	hmm, I don't know if I can match that talent in drawing form. I'm still learning all of this.
2015-11-08 05:39:59	@PikFan	well, it's not drawing, it's modeling
2015-11-08 05:40:27	@PikFan	Scruffy specializes in making 3D art, which is modeling
2015-11-08 05:40:36	@PikFan	you specialize in making 2D art, which is drawing
2015-11-08 05:40:47	Funky	I know the difference
2015-11-08 05:40:52	Funky	Why do you need both
2015-11-08 05:40:53	Funky	?
2015-11-08 05:41:16	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-08 05:41:23	@PikFan	sorry
2015-11-08 05:41:59	Funky	I feel like modeling is the step you take after the concept art
2015-11-08 05:42:05	Funky	and bam your done
2015-11-08 05:42:28	@PikFan	pretty much
2015-11-08 05:43:29	Funky	I am a game designer, so I know the process.
2015-11-08 05:44:52	@PikFan	ah, neat
2015-11-08 05:45:07	@PikFan	if you'd like, you can make a fangame
2015-11-08 05:45:57	Funky	Coming up with concepts doesn't come super easy.
2015-11-08 05:46:12	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-08 05:46:12	Funky	I just existing concepts it into action
2015-11-08 05:46:22	Funky	I just put*
2015-11-08 05:46:38	@PikFan	I mean, you don't have to
2015-11-08 05:46:56	@PikFan	most people just have new areas and a new story
2015-11-08 05:47:07	Funky	I kind of want to touch up on designs that en_passant has
2015-11-08 05:47:20	Funky	Maybe add a couple of fan images
2015-11-08 05:47:23	Funky	of the new pikmin
2015-11-08 05:47:55	Funky	The problem is, I have to squeeze in my schedule of three jobs and school. Plus finishing commissions I have
2015-11-08 05:48:27	En_Passant	If you're too busy, that's okay
2015-11-08 05:48:53	En_Passant	Beggars can't be choosers, I'd be happy with any improvements you have
2015-11-08 05:49:30	Funky	I'll try, I think it will be fun
2015-11-08 05:49:50	Funky	I miss the singing that the pikmin do in the second game
2015-11-08 05:49:56	@PikFan	wow, three jobs, that's a lot
2015-11-08 05:50:02	@PikFan	yeah, same
2015-11-08 05:51:14	Funky	It's not that bad. 7-1 I work at a groom room 2-6 work at the custard stand 7-11 I direct parking, then for an hour I work on drawings.
2015-11-08 05:51:39	Funky	But that hardcore money though
2015-11-08 05:52:55	Funky	I'm gonna die of exhaustion, atleast it's not every day
2015-11-08 05:53:44	@PikFan	I couldn't do it
2015-11-08 05:53:57	Funky	lol
2015-11-08 05:54:10	Funky	and my parents are upset I don't do sports as well
2015-11-08 05:54:11	En_Passant	I can hardly balance school and a part-time job
2015-11-08 05:56:25	Funky	Alright I'll be sure to add to the whole Pikmin 3 page
2015-11-08 05:56:29	@PikFan	I suck at school, I can't see myself holding a job long
2015-11-08 05:56:32	Funky	But I am tired
2015-11-08 05:56:39	@PikFan	no worries
2015-11-08 05:56:46	@PikFan	you can do it later
2015-11-08 05:57:12	Funky	How should I get the dismiss sound from Pikmin 3?
2015-11-08 05:57:25	@PikFan	ooh
2015-11-08 05:57:31	@PikFan	um
2015-11-08 05:57:33	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-08 05:57:39	En_Passant	Wait for the data miners to get it?
2015-11-08 05:57:48	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 05:57:57	@PikFan	there'll be a rip sooner or later
2015-11-08 05:58:02	Funky	Might have better quality

2015-11-08 06:31:55	@PikFan	I remember now
2015-11-08 06:32:28	@PikFan	he wants them to be like a non-elemental Dweevil, but doesn't want them to be like a copy of Breadbugs
2015-11-08 06:32:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-08 06:33:29	ScruffyChat	Maybe they just try to pick leaders up and move them around

2015-11-08 06:37:03	@PikFan	it's fine
2015-11-08 06:37:05	@PikFan	it's my job
2015-11-08 06:37:41	@PikFan	I Just Don't Know Why He Insists On Typing Like This
2015-11-08 06:38:20	ScruffyChat	Me either! It's positively backwards
2015-11-08 06:38:52	UltraMario	hey ScruffyChat, do you have Super Mario Maker? :o
2015-11-08 06:38:58	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-08 06:39:02	ScruffyChat	Oh I wish I did
2015-11-08 06:39:05	UltraMario	darn
2015-11-08 06:39:11	UltraMario	trying to find more people with smm :p
2015-11-08 06:39:15	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2015-11-08 06:39:19	@PikFan	UltraMario just wants you to play his remakes of classic levels
2015-11-08 06:39:19	UltraMario	it's okay ^^
2015-11-08 06:39:24	UltraMario	hey >:p
2015-11-08 06:39:29	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2015-11-08 06:39:33	@PikFan	what? it's the truth
2015-11-08 06:39:43	UltraMario	it's of a game no one's played anyway, so it's not like they'll notice
2015-11-08 06:39:44	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 06:39:58	ScruffyChat	Which game?
2015-11-08 06:40:04	@PikFan	you just called yourself nobody
2015-11-08 06:40:14	@PikFan	because you've played it
2015-11-08 06:40:18	@PikFan	:P
2015-11-08 06:40:27	UltraMario	the game is more of a nobody :p
2015-11-08 06:40:39	UltraMario	Super Mario Bros. Special
2015-11-08 06:40:54	UltraMario	the obscure sequel to smb made by hudson soft in 1986
2015-11-08 06:41:17	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-08 06:41:39	ScruffyChat	Well I do have that Super Mario game with remakes of Super Mario Bros., 2, and 3
2015-11-08 06:41:42	UltraMario	figured i'd remake obscure stuff instead of stuff everybody knows so maybe they'll be less obscure
2015-11-08 06:41:45	ScruffyChat	Is it Deluxe?
2015-11-08 06:41:52	UltraMario	all-stars
2015-11-08 06:41:58	ScruffyChat	That's it
2015-11-08 06:42:17	UltraMario	although there was a port of smb1 and tll called smbdx, but that's just a port :p
2015-11-08 06:42:20	UltraMario	although it does add stuff
2015-11-08 06:42:59	ScruffyChat	Woah, there was more classic Mario than I thought
2015-11-08 06:43:17	ScruffyChat	I was considering going on the Mario wiki and making some music articles there
2015-11-08 06:43:39	ScruffyChat	But then I realized "some" would mean tons and tons of work on a lot of games I haven't even tried
2015-11-08 06:44:13	UltraMario	music articles?
2015-11-08 06:44:40	UltraMario	do you mean like articles on songs from mario games? how would that work? :p
2015-11-08 06:44:52	ScruffyChat	I wrote the updated articles on Pikipedia about the music in Pikmin
2015-11-08 06:45:01	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 06:45:23	UltraMario	people have uploaded ogg files i think of songs from mario and just put them on the article for the respective game
2015-11-08 06:45:36	ScruffyChat	It's not just a list of all the music in the game, but a description of why the music works and what it's doing
2015-11-08 06:45:40	UltraMario	ah
2015-11-08 06:45:49	UltraMario	well there's articles on mario songs that have lyrics
2015-11-08 06:45:55	UltraMario	like the DK Rap
2015-11-08 06:46:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-08 06:46:36	ScruffyChat	Really I've looked at the music articles on the wiki and I think that, for a wiki about so many games, they're fine the way they are
2015-11-08 06:46:55	UltraMario	yeah
2015-11-08 06:47:05	UltraMario	it's got quite a wide range of coverage :p
2015-11-08 06:47:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-08 06:47:22	UltraMario	it's not just games either. movies, tv shows, comics, mangas, and more
2015-11-08 06:47:34	UltraMario	mario is quite a mess of a series :p
2015-11-08 06:47:38	ScruffyChat	Of all the Mario game soundtracks, either 3d world or MarioKart 8 is my favorite
2015-11-08 06:47:40	ScruffyChat	Indeed
2015-11-08 06:48:00	UltraMario	there is articles the soundtracks to games if they do have them btw
2015-11-08 06:48:11	UltraMario	and they have tracklisting and stuff
2015-11-08 06:48:22	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-11-08 06:48:35	ScruffyChat	But I'm talking about writing about the music theory behind the soundtracks
2015-11-08 06:48:42	UltraMario	yeah, i get that
2015-11-08 06:48:54	UltraMario	what is music theory tho?
2015-11-08 06:48:58	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 06:49:17	ScruffyChat	Plainly, it's just a way of organizing sound
2015-11-08 06:49:47	UltraMario	so does it like describe the music or something?
2015-11-08 06:50:00	ScruffyChat	Precisely
2015-11-08 06:50:03	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 06:50:24	ScruffyChat	In fact, I wouldn't say there's ever a time in Mario I've found that breaks music theory rules
2015-11-08 06:50:24	UltraMario	i dont know if this would really need that, but you could make a proposal or something about it
2015-11-08 06:50:38	ScruffyChat	I don't think it would really need it either
2015-11-08 06:51:07	ScruffyChat	But I commend the extensiveness of all your articles on Mario music
2015-11-08 06:51:15	En_Passant	Have you played the Paper Mario games, Scruffy?
2015-11-08 06:51:19	En_Passant	They have fantastic music
2015-11-08 06:51:27	UltraMario	they do
2015-11-08 06:51:32	ScruffyChat	I've played the original (on Wii) and Super Paper Mario
2015-11-08 06:51:50	ScruffyChat	Super Paper Mario had one track that I can't get enough of, the theme for Flipside
2015-11-08 06:51:51	UltraMario	even the worst game in the series (sticker star) still has pretty good music for what it's worth :p
2015-11-08 06:52:01	ScruffyChat	Oh yes, it has its gems
2015-11-08 06:52:10	ScruffyChat	To be honest though
2015-11-08 06:52:20	@PikFan	the Yold Ruins theme is really interesting
2015-11-08 06:52:25	ScruffyChat	I never got the point of the soundtrack to the Thousand Year Door
2015-11-08 06:52:33	UltraMario	i liked ttyd's soundtrack
2015-11-08 06:52:36	@PikFan	same
2015-11-08 06:52:43	En_Passant	Agreed
2015-11-08 06:52:44	@PikFan	but what do you mean?
2015-11-08 06:52:47	ScruffyChat	I like it too
2015-11-08 06:52:51	@PikFan	also hi En_Passant
2015-11-08 06:52:53	ScruffyChat	I just feel it's always really busy
2015-11-08 06:53:00	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-08 06:53:08	UltraMario	hm
2015-11-08 06:53:11	@PikFan	like... it's lively all the time?
2015-11-08 06:53:13	ScruffyChat	And sometimes a little distracting
2015-11-08 06:53:15	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-08 06:53:18	UltraMario	maybe that's what they were going for?
2015-11-08 06:53:26	ScruffyChat	There are a lot of textures that are moving around all the time
2015-11-08 06:53:28	@PikFan	the music never bothered me
2015-11-08 06:53:33	ScruffyChat	It could be what they're going for
2015-11-08 06:53:37	En_Passant	You'd probably have to play the game to figure that out, Scruffy
2015-11-08 06:53:37	UltraMario	maybe they wanted to make the game world more lively than ever, so they livened up the music too
2015-11-08 06:53:47	ScruffyChat	Also I haven't played the whole thing
2015-11-08 06:54:00	ScruffyChat	I tried emulating it, but it would freeze up in Sogport
2015-11-08 06:54:14	@PikFan	brb
2015-11-08 06:54:59	ScruffyChat	I should try to play all of it though, it seemed like an even larger game than Paper Mario
2015-11-08 06:55:10	ScruffyChat	Which also had a good, catchy soundtrack
2015-11-08 06:55:15	UltraMario	it is
2015-11-08 06:55:37	ScruffyChat	But if you really want a good paper game with an amazing soundtrack, I'd recommend Tearaway
2015-11-08 06:55:51	ScruffyChat	The game is not as good as paper mario
2015-11-08 06:55:56	ScruffyChat	but the soundtrack is looooovely
2015-11-08 06:56:08	ScruffyChat	I'm a sucker for live recorded soundtracks
2015-11-08 06:56:16	UltraMario	orchestra?
2015-11-08 06:56:36	ScruffyChat	No, it's like an ensemble of violin, flute, guitar,
2015-11-08 06:56:42	ScruffyChat	Just a few performers
2015-11-08 06:56:44	UltraMario	oh ok
2015-11-08 06:56:53	ScruffyChat	It's very folky and rich
2015-11-08 06:57:49	ScruffyChat	Anyway, that's why 3d world and mariokart 8 have my favorite mario soundtracks
2015-11-08 06:57:56	ScruffyChat	And the Galaxies are runners-up
2015-11-08 06:57:57	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 06:58:02	En_Passant	I see
2015-11-08 06:58:07	ScruffyChat	they finally went big and recorded the soundtrack live
2015-11-08 06:58:08	UltraMario	i was thinking orchestra
2015-11-08 06:58:10	UltraMario	like galaxy
2015-11-08 06:58:13	UltraMario	so :p
2015-11-08 06:58:19	ScruffyChat	Galaxy was amazing
2015-11-08 06:58:25	UltraMario	great music
2015-11-08 06:58:25	En_Passant	Eh, MK8 felt like its instrument selection was shallow
2015-11-08 06:58:33	UltraMario	i liked mk8's music
2015-11-08 06:59:15	En_Passant	The majority of the tracks feature either a sax or violins
2015-11-08 06:59:26	En_Passant	The music's good, but it can get repetitive
2015-11-08 06:59:31	ScruffyChat	Only a handful are live recordings
2015-11-08 06:59:42	ScruffyChat	And I do agree with the repetitiveness
2015-11-08 06:59:43	UltraMario	not as bad as the original soundtrack for rse
2015-11-08 06:59:46	UltraMario	which is
2015-11-08 06:59:48	UltraMario	lots of trumpets
2015-11-08 06:59:49	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 06:59:53	ScruffyChat	RSE?
2015-11-08 06:59:58	UltraMario	ruby sapphire emerald
2015-11-08 07:00:00	UltraMario	pokemon
2015-11-08 07:00:04	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2015-11-08 07:00:18	UltraMario	also sonic adventure 2 had lots of electric guitar
2015-11-08 07:00:31	ScruffyChat	Mostly that
2015-11-08 07:00:33	UltraMario	i prefer sa1's music for more variety :p
2015-11-08 07:00:39	ScruffyChat	Same
2015-11-08 07:00:53	UltraMario	my favorite sonic soundtrack btw
2015-11-08 07:01:03	ScruffyChat	It's tough
2015-11-08 07:01:09	En_Passant	SA1 had a lot of electric guitar, too
2015-11-08 07:01:16	ScruffyChat	I think soundtracks get better with time
2015-11-08 07:01:18	UltraMario	it did? :|
2015-11-08 07:01:25	ScruffyChat	Oh yes
2015-11-08 07:01:40	UltraMario	i only remember a few tracks having electric guitar :p
2015-11-08 07:01:43	ScruffyChat	Sonic featured punk/rock/jazz electric guitar
2015-11-08 07:01:47	ScruffyChat	And ska
2015-11-08 07:02:02	UltraMario	more variety than sa2 :p
2015-11-08 07:02:03	ScruffyChat	In the adventures, that is
2015-11-08 07:02:03	@PikFan	Hyrule Warrior's soundtrack is pretty repetitive
2015-11-08 07:02:14	@PikFan	don't get me wrong, I love Hyrule Warriors
2015-11-08 07:02:22	ScruffyChat	Ah, so many soundtracks to discuss
2015-11-08 07:02:29	UltraMario	i like the soundtrack to that although i havent played it :p
2015-11-08 07:02:29	@PikFan	but in quite a few of the songs, there's so
2015-11-08 07:02:30	@PikFan	many
2015-11-08 07:02:31	@PikFan	drums
2015-11-08 07:02:33	ScruffyChat	There's so many minute details that make me love these soundtracks
2015-11-08 07:02:49	En_Passant	Speaking of Legend of Zelda
2015-11-08 07:02:54	En_Passant	ALBW is based
2015-11-08 07:02:58	ScruffyChat	Pikmin was the most avant-garde, so I had to talk about it first
2015-11-08 07:03:02	UltraMario	based?
2015-11-08 07:03:19	ScruffyChat	But maybe I will end up writing about video game music more often
2015-11-08 07:03:48	En_Passant	Based. It's slang that means incredible. I knew it was a bad idea to use it
2015-11-08 07:04:04	UltraMario	oh ok
2015-11-08 07:04:07	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 07:04:12	ScruffyChat	Hahahahaha don't worry I've heard that before
2015-11-08 07:04:15	UltraMario	albw does have a great soundtrack
2015-11-08 07:04:18	ScruffyChat	I get it now
2015-11-08 07:05:22	ScruffyChat	Wind Waker has my favorite Zelda music so far
2015-11-08 07:05:39	ScruffyChat	Wait, strike that
2015-11-08 07:05:51	UltraMario	it's hard to pick
2015-11-08 07:05:51	ScruffyChat	Original Legend of Zelda is my favorite
2015-11-08 07:05:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-08 07:05:56	UltraMario	there's lots of good zelda soundtracks
2015-11-08 07:05:58	UltraMario	>zelda 1
2015-11-08 07:06:03	UltraMario	that had like 4 songs :p
2015-11-08 07:06:12	ScruffyChat	4 great songs
2015-11-08 07:06:27	ScruffyChat	And I'm guilty of loving their arrangements in Nintendo Land
2015-11-08 07:06:36	@PikFan	I liked Twilight Princess' soundtrack, even though it had a MIDI soundfont
2015-11-08 07:06:51	UltraMario	i do too
2015-11-08 07:06:55	@PikFan	aaaah, I'd love it even more if it had HD graphics and an orchestrated soundtrack
2015-11-08 07:06:56	UltraMario	also yeah i can see what you mean
2015-11-08 07:07:05	UltraMario	doesnt it already have hd graphics sort of?
2015-11-08 07:07:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I feel like Twilight Princess's soundtrack could be orchestrated really well
2015-11-08 07:07:08	UltraMario	i mean
2015-11-08 07:07:12	UltraMario	it's on the wii, but
2015-11-08 07:07:15	UltraMario	for the wii
2015-11-08 07:07:19	UltraMario	it's pretty detailed
2015-11-08 07:07:25	En_Passant	It came out on GC too
2015-11-08 07:07:37	@PikFan	it was actually originally developed for GCN
2015-11-08 07:07:53	En_Passant	Also, there's evidence that a TP remake is likely underway
2015-11-08 07:07:54	ScruffyChat	That reminds me, since Pikmin 3 was developed for Wii first
2015-11-08 07:07:56	@PikFan	so people say that it has great graphics for the GCN
2015-11-08 07:08:01	En_Passant	At least, if GameXplain is to be believed
2015-11-08 07:08:02	@PikFan	but not so much for Wii
2015-11-08 07:08:13	UltraMario	yeah i know
2015-11-08 07:08:13	@PikFan	yeah, I heard that
2015-11-08 07:08:18	ScruffyChat	Playing Pikmin 3 in standard definition feels better to me than playing it in HD
2015-11-08 07:08:25	@PikFan	because they found a TP icon in the eShop or whatever
2015-11-08 07:08:31	@PikFan	hm, why?
2015-11-08 07:08:37	UltraMario	btw
2015-11-08 07:08:41	--	Yoshi2|offline is now known as Yoshi2
2015-11-08 07:08:44	UltraMario	did you know SPM was originally intended for GameCube?
2015-11-08 07:08:45	UltraMario	:o
2015-11-08 07:08:47	@PikFan	hi Yoshi2
2015-11-08 07:09:09	@PikFan	oh yeah, I think I heard something about that
2015-11-08 07:09:13	ScruffyChat	Has everyone here played SPM?
2015-11-08 07:09:16	@PikFan	read it on Mario Wiki, I think
2015-11-08 07:09:17	UltraMario	i have
2015-11-08 07:09:17	ScruffyChat	Finished it?
2015-11-08 07:09:19	@PikFan	yeah, I own it
2015-11-08 07:09:21	@PikFan	and finished it
2015-11-08 07:09:23	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 07:09:25	UltraMario	i think i got close
2015-11-08 07:09:30	@PikFan	it's sad
2015-11-08 07:09:47	ScruffyChat	I want to ask something, but I'm worried it's spoilers
2015-11-08 07:09:52	En_Passant	I got to floor 99 of Flopside pit and died
2015-11-08 07:09:58	ScruffyChat	It's about the Dark Pit of 100 Trials
2015-11-08 07:10:05	ScruffyChat	That's the one, the Flopside Pit
2015-11-08 07:10:10	En_Passant	But then I completed it afterward, don't worry
2015-11-08 07:10:13	UltraMario	that sounsd awful
2015-11-08 07:10:17	UltraMario	awful
2015-11-08 07:10:23	UltraMario	YOU TRIED SO HARD AND GOT SO FAR
2015-11-08 07:10:28	UltraMario	BUT IN THE END IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
2015-11-08 07:10:29	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 07:10:35	@PikFan	D:
2015-11-08 07:10:40	@PikFan	that is horrible
2015-11-08 07:10:46	@PikFan	I would have ragequit
2015-11-08 07:10:48	ScruffyChat	But then you got through it!
2015-11-08 07:10:52	ScruffyChat	That's dedication
2015-11-08 07:11:02	En_Passant	The reason I died was so stupid
2015-11-08 07:11:14	@PikFan	when I did the Flopside Pit of 100 Trials, I brought 10 Dyllis Deluxes with me
2015-11-08 07:11:15	En_Passant	I got camped by a Hammer Bro on the top of the map
2015-11-08 07:11:19	ScruffyChat	It always is
2015-11-08 07:11:20	@PikFan	lame
2015-11-08 07:11:30	UltraMario	reminds me when i got close to beating the final boss in splatoon and died
2015-11-08 07:11:38	UltraMario	i was flustered but kept going :p
2015-11-08 07:11:44	UltraMario	that boss is hard
2015-11-08 07:11:58	@PikFan	by the way, does anybody know the XP farming trick in SPM?
2015-11-08 07:12:06	En_Passant	The final boss is literally as long as a stage
2015-11-08 07:12:11	@PikFan	it's so convenient
2015-11-08 07:12:13	ScruffyChat	Ooh, I don't
2015-11-08 07:12:15	UltraMario	feels longer tho :p
2015-11-08 07:12:21	UltraMario	cuz i die a bunch
2015-11-08 07:12:48	ScruffyChat	I think I had too much beginner's luck or something, my brother and I beat the final boss in 30 seconds
2015-11-08 07:12:54	ScruffyChat	First time
2015-11-08 07:13:05	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TenhG5tHoKU
2015-11-08 07:13:20	En_Passant	Oh, by the way, someone's streaming Pikmin 3 All Fruits
2015-11-08 07:13:24	UltraMario	wat
2015-11-08 07:13:28	UltraMario	>30 seconds
2015-11-08 07:13:36	UltraMario	wait
2015-11-08 07:13:38	UltraMario	of spm?
2015-11-08 07:13:40	@PikFan	so you go to the last section of 1-1, clear everything EXCEPT for a Squig, and then you just keep bouncing off its rocks
2015-11-08 07:13:59	UltraMario	heh
2015-11-08 07:14:01	@PikFan	if you keep doing it long enough, you can get like 10k points in one jump
2015-11-08 07:14:05	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-11-08 07:14:07	UltraMario	it's like an infinite 1-up trick in a classic mario game
2015-11-08 07:14:27	ScruffyChat	<UltraMario>: of spm? Yes, final boss of SPM in 30 seconds
2015-11-08 07:14:27	@PikFan	so you can level up really fast with this trick
2015-11-08 07:14:39	ScruffyChat	I was like, "Was that it? I think I messed something up"
2015-11-08 07:14:40	UltraMario	oh ok
2015-11-08 07:14:41	En_Passant	Funnily enough, you start losing points when you try that trick in the game
2015-11-08 07:14:46	UltraMario	i thought you meant splatoon for a sec :p
2015-11-08 07:14:49	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 07:14:52	@PikFan	dunno why
2015-11-08 07:15:02	ScruffyChat	It's a break from mario formula
2015-11-08 07:15:03	@PikFan	@the classic 1up trick
2015-11-08 07:15:09	ScruffyChat	Do too well, lose points
2015-11-08 07:15:16	UltraMario	wait
2015-11-08 07:15:22	UltraMario	you lose points doing the infinite 1-up trick?
2015-11-08 07:15:31	@PikFan	yeah, in SPM
2015-11-08 07:15:35	@PikFan	if you do it too long
2015-11-08 07:15:37	UltraMario	o
2015-11-08 07:15:48	@PikFan	like, you'll initially get points
2015-11-08 07:15:53	@PikFan	then you start losing then
2015-11-08 07:15:54	@PikFan	*them
2015-11-08 07:16:25	@PikFan	but yeah, because of this trick, my HP is like 185 and I have an attack of 30 something
2015-11-08 07:16:33	@PikFan	so!
2015-11-08 07:17:39	@PikFan	also, in TTYD, apparently a lot of people fight the final boss below level 30
2015-11-08 07:17:45	@PikFan	I can't do it
2015-11-08 07:17:52	@PikFan	I have to get to like level 35
2015-11-08 07:17:59	@PikFan	mainly for BP, but eh
2015-11-08 07:18:26	ScruffyChat	Oh, that was it
2015-11-08 07:18:34	@PikFan	?
2015-11-08 07:18:36	ScruffyChat	My attack was really high when I fought the final boss
2015-11-08 07:18:44	ScruffyChat	Must have been
2015-11-08 07:18:47	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-08 07:18:48	@PikFan	makes sense
2015-11-08 07:18:53	En_Passant	I just use Bowser + Carrie
2015-11-08 07:18:58	@PikFan	Super Dimentio has HP of 200, I think
2015-11-08 07:18:58	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-08 07:19:18	ScruffyChat	Really regular dimentio was harder
2015-11-08 07:19:33	@PikFan	gaaaah
2015-11-08 07:19:38	ScruffyChat	The first time I met him in that area, I agreed to everything he said
2015-11-08 07:19:41	@PikFan	I want them to make a Paper Mario U sometime
2015-11-08 07:19:49	ScruffyChat	oooh
2015-11-08 07:19:52	@PikFan	in the Dotwood Tree?
2015-11-08 07:19:52	UltraMario	same
2015-11-08 07:20:00	UltraMario	if they do it better be an actual rpg this time
2015-11-08 07:20:01	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 07:20:04	ScruffyChat	Maybe they'll actually make it look like paper
2015-11-08 07:20:05	@PikFan	agreed
2015-11-08 07:20:08	UltraMario	rather than sticker star
2015-11-08 07:20:13	UltraMario	which was like
2015-11-08 07:20:16	UltraMario	an rpg but not
2015-11-08 07:20:19	@PikFan	I'm not touching Sticker Star
2015-11-08 07:20:26	UltraMario	dont
2015-11-08 07:20:27	@PikFan	I heard that they got rid of partners in it
2015-11-08 07:20:30	UltraMario	yes
2015-11-08 07:20:31	UltraMario	and
2015-11-08 07:20:34	UltraMario	levelling up
2015-11-08 07:20:35	UltraMario	and
2015-11-08 07:20:38	@PikFan	they also got rid of — YEAH
2015-11-08 07:20:40	En_Passant	Everything
2015-11-08 07:20:41	UltraMario	badges
2015-11-08 07:20:41	UltraMario	and
2015-11-08 07:20:43	UltraMario	yes
2015-11-08 07:20:52	UltraMario	lots of stuff
2015-11-08 07:20:56	En_Passant	The only things they kept were turns and jump/hammer
2015-11-08 07:20:59	@PikFan	I heard there was also a lot of backtracking too
2015-11-08 07:21:04	UltraMario	yeah
2015-11-08 07:21:15	UltraMario	those were for bonuses tho i think
2015-11-08 07:21:17	En_Passant	I used a guide for most of the game
2015-11-08 07:21:25	En_Passant	The Things were awful
2015-11-08 07:21:29	UltraMario	and for like more of those things
2015-11-08 07:21:30	@PikFan	that Rewind Chronicles game is really good
2015-11-08 07:21:45	@PikFan	En_Passant didn't you say you got hooked on it
2015-11-08 07:22:44	En_Passant	Yeah, it looks very interesting
2015-11-08 07:22:48	@PikFan	this really does feel like the true final battle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEKzn3MQW0U
2015-11-08 07:23:19	@PikFan	there's technically 24 chapters in the game
2015-11-08 07:23:29	@PikFan	so a Paper Mario game 3 times longer than TTYD
2015-11-08 07:23:36	@PikFan	I'm sold
2015-11-08 07:23:42	En_Passant	I thought it was only 12
2015-11-08 07:23:46	@PikFan	oh no
2015-11-08 07:23:51	@PikFan	you get to play as Peach
2015-11-08 07:23:59	@PikFan	Peach has 12 chapters of her own, too
2015-11-08 07:24:23	ScruffyChat	anyone else ever thought Paper Mario Galaxy would be neat?
2015-11-08 07:24:42	@PikFan	ignoring the weird physics, yeah, I think it'd be cool
2015-11-08 07:24:55	UltraMario	wat
2015-11-08 07:25:07	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 07:25:12	UltraMario	you mean a fan game
2015-11-08 07:25:15	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 07:25:25	UltraMario	i thought you were talking about sticker star for a second :p
2015-11-08 07:25:25	@PikFan	I wish it was real though :(
2015-11-08 07:25:31	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2015-11-08 07:25:33	 *	UltraMario silly

2015-11-08 07:27:11	UltraMario	go back to bed :p
2015-11-08 07:27:13	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 07:27:16	@PikFan	what's your job?
2015-11-08 07:27:18	Pi	so I have to take a shower
2015-11-08 07:27:18	UltraMario	also maybe christmas?
2015-11-08 07:27:22	Pi	I'm a paperboy
2015-11-08 07:27:25	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-08 07:27:29	UltraMario	piperboy ;)
2015-11-08 07:27:29	@PikFan	heh, how fitting
2015-11-08 07:27:30	UltraMario	*shot*
2015-11-08 07:27:32	Pi	I deliver 200+ newspapers each Sunday
2015-11-08 07:27:36	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-08 07:27:40	UltraMario	wow
2015-11-08 07:27:49	Pi	it's A Lot
2015-11-08 07:27:49	En_Passant	Uh
2015-11-08 07:27:59	En_Passant	Does Pi have weird text to anyone else?
2015-11-08 07:28:04	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 07:28:06	@PikFan	special font
2015-11-08 07:28:06	Pi	it's a script I use
2015-11-08 07:28:10	ScruffyChat	It's glow in the dark
2015-11-08 07:28:14	@PikFan	well, special colors, I should say
2015-11-08 07:28:28	@PikFan	Espyo's text color is blue
2015-11-08 07:28:41	@PikFan	but no background
2015-11-08 07:28:45	Pi	his isn't as intrusive as mine
2015-11-08 07:29:07	@PikFan	it makes it easier to identify who's talking, I find
2015-11-08 07:29:21	Pi	the reason for the black background is that this green colour isn't easily recognisable under a plain, white background
2015-11-08 07:29:26	Pi	rather, over it
2015-11-08 07:29:34	@PikFan	true
2015-11-08 07:29:41	@PikFan	green
2015-11-08 07:29:49	@PikFan	yeah, I see what you're saying
2015-11-08 07:29:50	Pi	that green is okay
2015-11-08 07:29:59	Pi	but the one green I'm using
2015-11-08 07:30:06	Pi	which is like
2015-11-08 07:30:06	@PikFan	wait, is it this green?
2015-11-08 07:30:09	Pi	lime green?
2015-11-08 07:30:11	Pi	yes, that one
2015-11-08 07:30:13	Pi	lime green
2015-11-08 07:30:17	En_Passant	how do you do that
2015-11-08 07:30:17	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-08 07:30:30	@PikFan	okay, under the text box there's a thing called Colours
2015-11-08 07:30:31	ScruffyChat	That's a big difference
2015-11-08 07:30:48	En_Passant	Oh
2015-11-08 07:30:54	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-08 07:30:56	@PikFan	yeah, you've got it
2015-11-08 07:31:49	En_Passant	How about light gray?
2015-11-08 07:31:58	ScruffyChat	How ghostly
2015-11-08 07:32:02	Pi	that's like
2015-11-08 07:32:09	Pi	Text Impossible To See
2015-11-08 07:32:17	Pi	nobody here will get that reference
2015-11-08 07:32:18	Pi	rip
2015-11-08 07:32:30	Pi	(it's Homestuck)
2015-11-08 07:32:52	Pi	(it's a fan-album that was called, 'Symphony Impossible To Play')
2015-11-08 07:32:52	@PikFan	my friends might've understood it, but they don't use IRC
2015-11-08 07:34:22	ScruffyChat	This is a great community, I'm very glad to have joined it
2015-11-08 07:34:29	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-08 07:34:48	@PikFan	wasn't quite like this several users ago
2015-11-08 07:34:57	@PikFan	it was just me, Espyo, and J
2015-11-08 07:35:28	@PikFan	*several years ago
2015-11-08 07:35:42	@PikFan	though I guess "several users ago" works too, heh
2015-11-08 07:35:47	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-08 07:37:52	ScruffyChat	Once I had thought of this game, based on the idea-mixing of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games
2015-11-08 07:38:28	ScruffyChat	Mario would play through Kirby levels, Kirby would play through Pikmin levels, Pikmin would play through Sonic levels, and Sonic would play through Mario levels
2015-11-08 07:38:32	ScruffyChat	And they'd all rotate
2015-11-08 07:38:45	UltraMario	reminds me of Super Mario Bros. Crossover
2015-11-08 07:38:54	UltraMario	except in that everyone is playing in Mario levels :p
2015-11-08 07:39:23	En_Passant	I used to have an idea for a game series where each game had you travel to a different Nintendo franchise
2015-11-08 07:40:16	ScruffyChat	The gray text aids the feeling of reminiscence, nice touch
2015-11-08 07:40:50	ScruffyChat	But who or what would be the thing that travels through Nintendo's franchises?
2015-11-08 07:40:53	UltraMario	so like kingdom hearts but with nintendo franchises?
2015-11-08 07:41:01	ScruffyChat	Besides the intense desire to hurt each other for no reason
2015-11-08 07:41:08	UltraMario	also maybe miis?
2015-11-08 07:41:13	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2015-11-08 07:41:18	En_Passant	This idea was before Miis
2015-11-08 07:41:21	ScruffyChat	That's Nintendo Land in a nutshell
2015-11-08 07:41:34	ScruffyChat	But Nintendo Land is only one game
2015-11-08 07:41:35	UltraMario	well i mean those are just attractions in nintendo land
2015-11-08 07:41:43	UltraMario	this is traveling to the actual nintendo worlds
2015-11-08 07:41:46	En_Passant	It was going to be an original universe of its own
2015-11-08 07:41:54	UltraMario	what would be the main cha-
2015-11-08 07:41:55	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 07:42:00	UltraMario	so it'd be an original character?
2015-11-08 07:42:07	En_Passant	Yes
2015-11-08 07:42:16	En_Passant	The plot involved dimensional travel for MacGuffins which happened to be artifacts in those universes
2015-11-08 07:42:19	UltraMario	reminds me of kh again :p
2015-11-08 07:42:30	UltraMario	oh, neat
2015-11-08 07:42:52	UltraMario	so each universe would have its own artifact
2015-11-08 07:42:58	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-11-08 07:43:14	ScruffyChat	Would there be some sort of Grand Central Nintendo Station?
2015-11-08 07:43:15	En_Passant	And the final game would be in the original universe
2015-11-08 07:43:20	UltraMario	i'd buy it
2015-11-08 07:43:53	En_Passant	There wouldn't be a hub, because each universe would have its own game
2015-11-08 07:44:11	En_Passant	The antagonist would team up with the local archnemesis in each game
2015-11-08 07:44:21	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah, that'd be silly if there was one extra game that was JUST the hub
2015-11-08 07:44:29	UltraMario	local archnemesis? is that also an original character?
2015-11-08 07:44:52	UltraMario	is he like the villain in the original universe budding with the villains in other worlds?
2015-11-08 07:44:57	En_Passant	Yes
2015-11-08 07:45:00	UltraMario	ah
2015-11-08 07:45:02	UltraMario	it'd be like a world map with each game universe, right?
2015-11-08 07:45:11	En_Passant	?
2015-11-08 07:45:12	ScruffyChat	Well the local ones would be like Bowser, Ganon, King Dedede, etc.
2015-11-08 07:45:16	UltraMario	when you travel between each i mean
2015-11-08 07:45:31	En_Passant	Each one has its own game
2015-11-08 07:45:41	UltraMario	well i meant like
2015-11-08 07:45:44	En_Passant	Do I need to explain it in more detail?
2015-11-08 07:45:48	UltraMario	how would you get between worlds? :p
2015-11-08 07:46:02	En_Passant	Intro/conclusion cutscenes
2015-11-08 07:46:11	UltraMario	are they all on an interconnected map o-
2015-11-08 07:46:11	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 07:46:14	UltraMario	okay then
2015-11-08 07:46:24	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-08 07:46:25	@PikFan	but why would each universe need its own game...?
2015-11-08 07:46:26	En_Passant	So, like, the first game would take place in the Mario series
2015-11-08 07:46:38	En_Passant	And then the second one takes place in Kirby or something
2015-11-08 07:46:41	UltraMario	i think he means franchise
2015-11-08 07:46:43	ScruffyChat	That's a new level of diegetic/physical marriage
2015-11-08 07:47:16	ScruffyChat	Representing the universes of Nintendo as all within a Nintendo multiverse, and the multiverse is a collection of game disks
2015-11-08 07:47:26	UltraMario	heh
2015-11-08 07:47:31	UltraMario	2meta4me
2015-11-08 07:47:32	En_Passant	Well, the original universe would be an outsider
2015-11-08 07:47:50	ScruffyChat	Possibly representing the player
2015-11-08 07:47:52	UltraMario	if there were a game like this, it'd be neat if it had the more niche nintendo franchises as well
2015-11-08 07:47:55	UltraMario	like earthbound
2015-11-08 07:48:05	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-08 07:48:13	UltraMario	or pikmin
2015-11-08 07:48:31	ScruffyChat	Or Kuru Kuru Kururin
2015-11-08 07:48:39	En_Passant	never heard of it
2015-11-08 07:48:41	UltraMario	eh
2015-11-08 07:48:44	Pi	KURU KURU KURURIN
2015-11-08 07:48:45	UltraMario	is that even a franchise tho? :p
2015-11-08 07:48:50	UltraMario	isnt that only one game
2015-11-08 07:48:55	Pi	BEST GAME EVER HOLY CRAP IT IS SO GOOOOOOD
2015-11-08 07:48:58	UltraMario	lol
2015-11-08 07:49:00	Pi	I LOVE IT
2015-11-08 07:49:02	ScruffyChat	Apparently more were released in japan
2015-11-08 07:49:05	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 07:49:13	UltraMario	or chibi robo
2015-11-08 07:49:19	Pi	there was one game
2015-11-08 07:49:23	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 07:49:30	UltraMario	well then it isn't really a franchise :p
2015-11-08 07:49:35	ScruffyChat	En Passant: it's that game where you try to steer a rotating bar through obstacles
2015-11-08 07:49:37	Pi	that was originally only released in Japan and Europe
2015-11-08 07:49:40	Pi	but
2015-11-08 07:49:44	Pi	there are two more games
2015-11-08 07:49:46	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-08 07:49:48	Pi	that are Japanese only
2015-11-08 07:49:52	UltraMario	i thought you said there was one
2015-11-08 07:50:02	En_Passant	Oh, that one that was an Assist Trophy in Brawl?
2015-11-08 07:50:04	UltraMario	yeah
2015-11-08 07:50:09	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-08 07:50:10	Pi	one game is Japan + Europe, two games are Japan only
2015-11-08 07:50:14	UltraMario	oh ok
2015-11-08 07:50:20	ScruffyChat	That's where everyone in the US has heard of it from
2015-11-08 07:50:30	@PikFan	has anyone here played Undertale
2015-11-08 07:50:31	Pi	I played it back in like
2015-11-08 07:50:36	Pi	2003/2004
2015-11-08 07:50:50	Pi	well
2015-11-08 07:50:50	UltraMario	rip custom robo
2015-11-08 07:50:55	@PikFan	because one time I was reading out loud a Pikmin fanfiction to my friends and they said it sounded like Undertale
2015-11-08 07:51:16	Pi	everyone in the MarioWiki community is obsessed over Undertale
2015-11-08 07:51:19	Pi	I'm not one of them
2015-11-08 07:51:26	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-11-08 07:51:36	@PikFan	oh, fandoms...
2015-11-08 07:51:50	UltraMario	mariowiki seems to be obsessed with multiple things
2015-11-08 07:51:55	UltraMario	they're like fads :p
2015-11-08 07:51:59	@PikFan	actually Undertale's going to be the fandom of the day at my school's Fandom Club next Tuesday
2015-11-08 07:52:05	UltraMario	like when everyone was into dangan ronpa
2015-11-08 07:52:09	UltraMario	on the wiki community
2015-11-08 07:52:29	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-11-08 07:52:36	Pi	Dangan "Dang It, Ron Paul!" Ronpa
2015-11-08 07:52:48	UltraMario	lol
2015-11-08 07:52:49	@PikFan	I don't edit on Mario Wiki because there's really no point to
2015-11-08 07:52:53	UltraMario	wynaut
2015-11-08 07:53:05	ScruffyChat	An astronaut from Wyoming
2015-11-08 07:53:07	Pi	he's got enough on his plate as is
2015-11-08 07:53:11	Pi	anyway
2015-11-08 07:53:15	Pi	proper shower time
2015-11-08 07:53:16	@PikFan	no it's not that
2015-11-08 07:53:32	@PikFan	it's because any information I could contribute is probably already on the wiki
2015-11-08 07:53:50	@PikFan	if anything, the edits I'd make would be small ones
2015-11-08 07:53:51	UltraMario	there's plenty to ad tho
2015-11-08 07:53:52	UltraMario	add
2015-11-08 07:53:59	@PikFan	like what?
2015-11-08 07:54:01	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 07:54:08	@PikFan	Mario Wiki feels complete imo
2015-11-08 07:54:10	UltraMario	info for lesser known games, or info for new games
2015-11-08 07:54:15	UltraMario	it'll never be complete :p
2015-11-08 07:54:28	@PikFan	okay, Mario Wiki feels complete for the games it already has
2015-11-08 07:54:47	UltraMario	mario is such a mess with a series, i dont think it'd ever be complete unless the series stopped :p
2015-11-08 07:55:07	@PikFan	100 years later, there's still Mario games going
2015-11-08 07:55:08	UltraMario	also there's plenty of more obscure games the wiki doesnt have much info on
2015-11-08 07:55:12	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-08 07:55:25	UltraMario	or like newly released titles that need to get the ball rolling on info
2015-11-08 07:55:29	ScruffyChat	100 years later!?
2015-11-08 07:55:38	@PikFan	I don't own any obscure Mario games, so I'm not of any use there
2015-11-08 07:55:40	ScruffyChat	What could they still be doing with Mario then
2015-11-08 07:55:46	@PikFan	who knows
2015-11-08 07:55:52	ScruffyChat	Mario tax rebate
2015-11-08 07:55:57	ScruffyChat	4
2015-11-08 07:56:02	@PikFan	I mean, Nintendo's already been around for over 100 years anyway...
2015-11-08 07:56:08	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-08 07:56:09	UltraMario	Mario City Simulator
2015-11-08 07:56:14	@PikFan	I wonder if they can go for another 100
2015-11-08 07:56:23	@PikFan	Mario is 30 years old, you know
2015-11-08 07:56:24	UltraMario	to be fair they've only been in the gaming industry for like 30 something years
2015-11-08 07:56:28	ScruffyChat	Ok, I need to get something off my chest
2015-11-08 07:56:29	@PikFan	well, technically 32
2015-11-08 07:56:32	ScruffyChat	The Wii Balance Board
2015-11-08 07:56:34	UltraMario	the other years before that were random stuff
2015-11-08 07:56:39	@PikFan	what about it?
2015-11-08 07:56:47	ScruffyChat	Had so much lost potential
2015-11-08 07:56:56	ScruffyChat	Think about a Mario game where you take the steps
2015-11-08 07:57:07	ScruffyChat	Like the Obstacle Course in Wii Fit
2015-11-08 07:57:12	@PikFan	UGH
2015-11-08 07:57:17	ScruffyChat	But you do the running, the jumping
2015-11-08 07:57:26	@PikFan	I hated but loved Obstacle Course
2015-11-08 07:57:43	ScruffyChat	Which is why Nintendo would have succeeded in a Mario-themed game around it
2015-11-08 07:57:50	@PikFan	I kept getting ran over by those rolling things
2015-11-08 07:57:52	UltraMario	eh
2015-11-08 07:58:04	UltraMario	i think that'd be better if they made a more advanced motion control thing
2015-11-08 07:58:12	UltraMario	more advanced than wii i mean
2015-11-08 07:58:25	UltraMario	idk if the wii balance board alone could handle that
2015-11-08 07:58:25	@PikFan	I feel like they should return to a traditional controller
2015-11-08 07:58:25	En_Passant	Kinect?
2015-11-08 07:58:32	UltraMario	like kinect, but actually works :p
2015-11-08 07:58:37	ScruffyChat	Haha
2015-11-08 07:58:39	@PikFan	I like innovation
2015-11-08 07:58:56	@PikFan	but I still want a traditional game controller
2015-11-08 07:58:59	UltraMario	well i wouldnt mind if they went traditional again, i was just saying i think a mario game like that would need better tech
2015-11-08 07:59:01	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 07:59:02	ScruffyChat	Spherical Screens 2015!
2015-11-08 07:59:04	@PikFan	GameCube Controller 2.0
2015-11-08 07:59:06	UltraMario	there's always the wii u pro controller
2015-11-08 07:59:12	@PikFan	well yeah
2015-11-08 07:59:32	@PikFan	but since it's got the same exact layout as the GamePad I just end up using the GamePad
2015-11-08 07:59:38	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 07:59:42	UltraMario	i like it better
2015-11-08 07:59:50	UltraMario	more comfy for longer periods of time :p
2015-11-08 07:59:52	@PikFan	yeah, it's easier to hold
2015-11-08 08:00:04	@PikFan	it's also super light
2015-11-08 08:00:07	UltraMario	i only use the gamepad when it's needed
2015-11-08 08:00:08	UltraMario	yup
2015-11-08 08:00:09	ScruffyChat	I hated that Nintendo didn't make a left-handed version of Stylus Mode in PIkmin 3
2015-11-08 08:00:13	@PikFan	I was amazed the first time I held it
2015-11-08 08:00:23	@PikFan	hmm, are you left-handed?
2015-11-08 08:00:32	ScruffyChat	I am a southpaw
2015-11-08 08:00:37	UltraMario	i bet you'd hate skyward sword then ;P
2015-11-08 08:00:40	ScruffyChat	and I can't do it with my left hand
2015-11-08 08:00:50	UltraMario	no left handers allowed in that game
2015-11-08 08:00:53	ScruffyChat	I have to use right to throw Pikmin, which is awkward and shaky
2015-11-08 08:01:32	@PikFan	that must be why you're so creative
2015-11-08 08:01:38	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-08 08:01:43	@PikFan	even though that's just a myth
2015-11-08 08:01:50	@PikFan	*misconception
2015-11-08 08:01:57	ScruffyChat	I'll tell you what, don't buy the game Left Brain Right Brain
2015-11-08 08:02:11	ScruffyChat	I thought it would be like Brain Age
2015-11-08 08:02:25	ScruffyChat	Intelligent
2015-11-08 08:02:31	UltraMario	what's that?
2015-11-08 08:02:31	ScruffyChat	Some semblance of correctness
2015-11-08 08:02:33	UltraMario	never heard of it
2015-11-08 08:02:47	ScruffyChat	It's a game made on a budget of someone's lunch money
2015-11-08 08:02:58	UltraMario	lol
2015-11-08 08:03:11	ScruffyChat	Where you play a minigame on the DS first with your right hand and then your left
2015-11-08 08:03:40	Pi	PikFan	Mario Wiki feels complete imo
2015-11-08 08:03:44	Pi	L O L
2015-11-08 08:03:46	Pi	there are like
2015-11-08 08:03:49	ScruffyChat	And if they get the same score, even after only one try, the game says you're ambidextrous
2015-11-08 08:03:52	Pi	1000 articles
2015-11-08 08:03:56	Pi	that need to be created
2015-11-08 08:03:57	@PikFan	at a glance
2015-11-08 08:03:59	Pi	in one project
2015-11-08 08:04:17	UltraMario	plenty of work to be done
2015-11-08 08:04:21	@PikFan	is there a category
2015-11-08 08:04:38	Pi	we're making a page for each star in each 3d mario game
2015-11-08 08:04:52	UltraMario	wait
2015-11-08 08:04:54	UltraMario	wut
2015-11-08 08:04:57	Pi	oh
2015-11-08 08:05:01	UltraMario	:|
2015-11-08 08:05:04	@PikFan	lol
2015-11-08 08:05:07	Pi	you're banned from the forums
2015-11-08 08:05:10	Pi	right
2015-11-08 08:05:12	UltraMario	i thought those were merged on the same page
2015-11-08 08:05:18	UltraMario	for each level article
2015-11-08 08:05:18	Pi	that's being changed
2015-11-08 08:05:20	UltraMario	also yes
2015-11-08 08:05:23	UltraMario	ah
2015-11-08 08:05:25	@PikFan	links
2015-11-08 08:05:27	Pi	because porple said so
2015-11-08 08:05:28	@PikFan	I need links
2015-11-08 08:05:39	ScruffyChat	to the past
2015-11-08 08:05:44	Pi	http://www.marioboards.com/index.php?topic=35664.0
2015-11-08 08:05:48	@PikFan	nice Scruffy
2015-11-08 08:05:50	Pi	S T U F F
2015-11-08 08:06:06	UltraMario	i can see it still
2015-11-08 08:06:26	UltraMario	also
2015-11-08 08:06:26	UltraMario	wait
2015-11-08 08:06:34	UltraMario	individual levels are being split too?
2015-11-08 08:06:35	UltraMario	like
2015-11-08 08:06:39	UltraMario	cuz there's articles for worlds
2015-11-08 08:06:42	ScruffyChat	Woah, that's a lot of articles
2015-11-08 08:06:43	UltraMario	but not levels
2015-11-08 08:06:47	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-08 08:06:47	UltraMario	@Pi
2015-11-08 08:06:48	Pi	that's being split too
2015-11-08 08:06:51	UltraMario	ah
2015-11-08 08:06:53	UltraMario	you know
2015-11-08 08:06:54	@PikFan	so each mission is getting its own article
2015-11-08 08:06:58	Pi	COMPLETE WIKI FISSION
2015-11-08 08:07:04	@PikFan	wouldn't they be short, though?
2015-11-08 08:07:10	Pi	yes
2015-11-08 08:07:13	Pi	that's the point
2015-11-08 08:07:14	UltraMario	the wiki was kinda inconsistent with tat anyway
2015-11-08 08:07:16	UltraMario	that
2015-11-08 08:07:17	UltraMario	like
2015-11-08 08:07:21	@PikFan	uh
2015-11-08 08:07:25	UltraMario	the individual levels for 3d world had articles
2015-11-08 08:07:29	Pi	the wiki already has a lot of short articles
2015-11-08 08:07:29	UltraMario	but not the older games
2015-11-08 08:07:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I shouldn't talk about the music
2015-11-08 08:07:31	UltraMario	and whatnot :p
2015-11-08 08:07:33	@PikFan	I'm not really a fan of short articles lying around everywhere
2015-11-08 08:07:35	ScruffyChat	What you have is fine
2015-11-08 08:07:43	@PikFan	combine articles if you can
2015-11-08 08:07:48	Pi	take this http://www.mariowiki.com/Clock_Out
2015-11-08 08:07:59	UltraMario	i am fine with short articles as long as it brings you a thing to go to the next mission or level
2015-11-08 08:08:03	UltraMario	and is organized like that
2015-11-08 08:08:21	@PikFan	that just feels like a stub to me, even if it's complete
2015-11-08 08:08:35	@PikFan	but eh, your wiki, your rules
2015-11-08 08:08:46	@PikFan	so I don't really have a say
2015-11-08 08:09:16	UltraMario	well
2015-11-08 08:09:29	UltraMario	even if they're short doesnt mean they're stubs
2015-11-08 08:09:40	UltraMario	if it has as much info as needed then i think it's fine :p
2015-11-08 08:09:49	@PikFan	that's why I said "even if it's complete"
2015-11-08 08:09:53	Pi	it's pointless arguing about this
2015-11-08 08:10:01	Pi	things work
2015-11-08 08:10:09	Pi	that's the point of things: that they work
2015-11-08 08:10:17	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 08:10:33	@PikFan	I don't even edit on there anyway, like I said, so anything I say is moot
2015-11-08 08:10:39	ScruffyChat	I didn't expect to get an article about cheese
2015-11-08 08:10:49	ScruffyChat	But lo and behold, it's in Luigi's Mansion
2015-11-08 08:11:15	Pi	now I'm thinking of the cheese fad
2015-11-08 08:11:22	Pi	everyone was obsessed with cheese
2015-11-08 08:11:36	Pi	they put them everywhere: on user talk pages, on the forum, etc
2015-11-08 08:11:42	Pi	userboxes were made
2015-11-08 08:11:44	Pi	it was
2015-11-08 08:11:48	Pi	cheese
2015-11-08 08:11:50	ScruffyChat	That's a mice way to think about it
2015-11-08 08:11:56	@PikFan	a cheesy chaos
2015-11-08 08:12:02	Pi	and
2015-11-08 08:12:05	ScruffyChat	Not that gouda
2015-11-08 08:12:09	Pi	when the cheese article was created

2015-11-08 08:13:54	@PikFan	"Cheese is one of the primary ingredients used for most varieties of pizza. Cheese is also used to make certain varieties of pasta as well, such as cannelloni, lasagna and macaroni. Mario-related, cheese-based products, such as Super Mario Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, have also struck up appearances on Earth."
2015-11-08 08:13:57	@PikFan	omg lol

2015-11-08 08:21:06	@PikFan	the nice thing about it is that it runs even when it's closed, unlike other idle games

2015-11-08 08:33:23	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-08 08:34:22	ScruffyChat	with this, it's not so much seeing numbers for me
2015-11-08 08:34:35	ScruffyChat	It's figuring out what type of thing to earn comes next
2015-11-08 08:34:52	@PikFan	ah

2015-11-08 08:40:49	ScruffyChat	I can imagine
2015-11-08 08:41:27	@PikFan	the nice thing is that I also got 400 more spicy sprays
2015-11-08 08:41:35	@PikFan	because of the flint beetles on sublevel 5
2015-11-08 08:41:50	@PikFan	and the double spray glitch
2015-11-08 08:41:51	ScruffyChat	Oooh

2015-11-08 08:42:09	@PikFan	it's too bad it isn't in P3...
2015-11-08 08:42:11	ScruffyChat	though*
2015-11-08 08:42:40	ScruffyChat	I love the P3 glitch where you can dodge as much as you want if you're against a wall
2015-11-08 08:42:48	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-11-08 08:42:52	@PikFan	it's amusing

2015-11-08 08:43:50	En_Passant	The spray glitch
2015-11-08 08:43:53	@PikFan	oh okay
2015-11-08 08:43:54	En_Passant	Also, it was sarcastic
2015-11-08 08:43:56	UltraMario	wat
2015-11-08 08:44:02	@PikFan	that's why I asked
2015-11-08 08:44:15	@PikFan	I have a hard time understanding sarcasm
2015-11-08 08:44:27	@PikFan	especially when it's sarcasm in text
2015-11-08 08:45:16	@PikFan	brb, food
2015-11-08 08:45:24	@PikFan	(20-30 minutes or so)

2015-11-08 09:09:44	@PikFan	if it's no trouble I've got a request
2015-11-08 09:10:30	@PikFan	could you make an area preview based off my map for the Torrid Desert? http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/5/57/Distant_Desert_map_01.jpg
2015-11-08 09:10:49	@PikFan	I'd like it if you could focus on the oasis
2015-11-08 09:13:25	ScruffyChat	no problem
2015-11-08 09:13:33	ScruffyChat	Might take a while, but it sounds fun
2015-11-08 09:13:37	@PikFan	awesome, thanks!
2015-11-08 09:13:54	@PikFan	and no worries, time's not an issue
2015-11-08 09:14:26	@PikFan	actually, time IS an issue...
2015-11-08 09:14:31	@PikFan	...for End of Time, anyway
2015-11-08 09:14:41	@PikFan	but I don't feel like discussing End of Time right now
2015-11-08 09:15:10	@PikFan	quantum physics + tiredness = incoherence
2015-11-08 09:15:27	ScruffyChat	Would you want the Dolphin 2.0, electric gate, and other objects in the scene?
2015-11-08 09:15:35	@PikFan	no
2015-11-08 09:15:41	ScruffyChat	Just terrain
2015-11-08 09:16:06	@PikFan	like, in my head, I can imagine the camera at ground level, like in the Impact Site render
2015-11-08 09:16:32	@PikFan	the camera would be positioned right behind reinforced wall, looking at the oasis

2015-11-08 09:17:03	ScruffyChat	Ah ok, no problem
2015-11-08 09:17:11	@PikFan	and in the background, you can see some desert foilage
2015-11-08 09:17:24	@PikFan	like palm trees
2015-11-08 09:17:29	ScruffyChat	So any more detail to the actual oasis? Or should it just be a ponds
2015-11-08 09:17:33	ScruffyChat	pond*
2015-11-08 09:17:41	@PikFan	would adding the shadows of palm trees be an issue?
2015-11-08 09:18:37	ScruffyChat	No
2015-11-08 09:18:43	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-08 09:18:53	ScruffyChat	I was just wondering if you'd want any features to the pond itself
2015-11-08 09:19:00	ScruffyChat	Enemies in it, or anything
2015-11-08 09:19:15	ScruffyChat	Or if it's just a body of water and nothing else
2015-11-08 09:19:16	@PikFan	perhaps a Yellow Wollywog
2015-11-08 09:19:42	ScruffyChat	Okay!
2015-11-08 09:19:57	@PikFan	it'd be similar to the lake at the far north of the Tropical Wilds
2015-11-08 09:20:44	@PikFan	also, one more thing, could you add a Burgeoning Spiderwort and a Pellet Posy, too?
2015-11-08 09:21:22	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-11-08 09:21:52	ScruffyChat	Although Burgeoning Spiderwort may look a bit different, I have to make it from scratch
2015-11-08 09:22:04	ScruffyChat	And Yellow Wollywog, unless I find the model somewhere
2015-11-08 09:23:12	@PikFan	that's fine
2015-11-08 09:23:20	ScruffyChat	great
2015-11-08 09:23:25	ScruffyChat	I've gotta sleep
2015-11-08 09:23:28	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2015-11-08 09:23:30	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-08 09:23:34	ScruffyChat	I may be on tomorrow
2015-11-08 09:23:37	@PikFan	no, it's fine, I don't mean to keep you

2015-11-08 13:25:25	Testyo	actually, every single one of these games is already on the corner of your eye before leaving
2015-11-08 13:25:43	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-08 13:25:56	@Espyo	Nvortex linked me to it, although I haven't seen the episode yet
2015-11-08 13:25:57	@Espyo	but...
2015-11-08 13:26:04	@Espyo	chuggaa's saying there are models for an unused area in the game's files
2015-11-08 13:26:06	@Espyo	and he's full of it
2015-11-08 13:26:10	@Espyo	I know there aren't
2015-11-08 13:27:48	Yoshi2	I wish there were models for an unused area in the game's files
2015-11-08 13:28:05	Yoshi2	Espyo: any idea where he gets that information from?
2015-11-08 13:28:35	@Espyo	I'd love to say wikia
2015-11-08 13:28:37	@Espyo	but... nope
2015-11-08 13:28:44	@Espyo	I'll check again once more today
2015-11-08 13:29:07	@Espyo	but if I saw anything that hinted at an unused area, I'd flip out, like the unused enemies
2015-11-08 13:29:13	@Espyo	and there's data for areas on a lot of places
2015-11-08 13:29:21	@Espyo	...Nintendo loves being disorganized
2015-11-08 13:29:27	@Espyo	but every one of those only mentions the used areas
2015-11-08 13:29:34	@Espyo	heck, one or two DO have a "debug" folder of sorts
2015-11-08 13:29:38	@Espyo	but it's always empty
2015-11-08 13:29:53	@Espyo	I might be remembering wrong; I don't know the entire ROM from heart...
2015-11-08 13:34:02	Yoshi2	"wikia" would be hilarious
2015-11-08 13:34:22	@Espyo	hey, he got the info that wingeds cause 2x damage to airborne enemies from wikia
2015-11-08 15:46:00	Testyo	sqrt(((1 - 5)^2 + (4 - length: len(sys.argv)
2015-11-08 15:46:24	Yoshi2	Testyo: thx
2015-11-08 15:46:25	Testyo	never really heard of those things that needs overthinking...
2015-11-08 15:48:49	@Espyo	Testyo: lm 2
2015-11-08 15:48:50	Testyo	I said sqrt(((1 - 5)^2 + (4 - length: len(sys.argv) because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages sqrt(((1 - 5)^2 + (4 - 5)^2 + (10 - 5)^2) / 3) and check length: len(sys.argv).
2015-11-08 15:49:01	@Espyo	he's combining code with code
2015-11-08 15:49:03	@Espyo	save yourselves

2015-11-08 17:36:15	@Espyo	so I tweeted chuggaa about everything I could find regarding any sixth area
2015-11-08 17:36:20	@Espyo	https://twitter.com/PikipediaTweets/status/663393473559715840
2015-11-08 17:36:23	@Espyo	it BLEW UP
2015-11-08 17:36:27	@Espyo	it has so many likes and retweets
2015-11-08 17:36:38	@Espyo	and we went from 41 followers to 57+
2015-11-08 17:41:22	Yoshi2	Espyo: so there is no sixth area in the game?
2015-11-08 17:43:43	Pi	wait
2015-11-08 17:43:46	Pi	was that number
2015-11-08 17:43:48	Pi	some
2015-11-08 17:43:54	Pi	standard deviation or something????
2015-11-08 17:44:03	Pi	sqrt(((1 - 5)^2 + (4 - 5)^2 + (10 - 5)^2) / 3), that is
2015-11-08 17:44:28	Yoshi2	no idea
2015-11-08 17:44:57	Pi	the average is certainly 5 [(1+4+10)/3 = 5], so
2015-11-08 17:45:05	Pi	but
2015-11-08 17:45:12	Pi	>dividing with 3
2015-11-08 17:45:21	Pi	noooooooooooo baaaaaaaaaaaaaad
2015-11-08 17:45:32	Pi	that gives a biased estimation of the standard deviation
2015-11-08 17:45:48	Pi	an unbiased estimation of the standard deviation is to divide by n-1
2015-11-08 17:45:58	Yoshi2	soo
2015-11-08 17:46:03	Yoshi2	we divide by 2? ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2015-11-08 17:46:23	Pi	yes
2015-11-08 17:46:26	@Espyo	*shrug*
2015-11-08 17:46:28	@Espyo	and yeah, no sixth area
2015-11-08 17:46:36	@Espyo	in trailers, they did show a mysterious area
2015-11-08 17:46:44	@Espyo	really lake-like, loads of greens, had lily pads
2015-11-08 17:46:48	Pi	apparently the answer for the true standard deviation is √21
2015-11-08 17:46:49	@Espyo	but there's nothing similar in the final game
2015-11-08 17:46:56	@Espyo	but they could've just made an area just to show off
2015-11-08 17:47:06	@Espyo	just because they made something doesn't mean an entire area was planned
2015-11-08 17:47:59	Yoshi2	I'm still a sad panda
2015-11-08 17:48:11	Yoshi2	no E3 area
2015-11-08 17:48:28	Yoshi2	the first pikmin had a freaking windows build on the disc
2015-11-08 17:48:34	Yoshi2	the second game still had a lot of stuff
2015-11-08 17:48:48	Yoshi2	why doesn't 3 have lots of unused stuff too? :<<<<<
2015-11-08 17:49:16	Pi	Yoshi2	the first pikmin had a freaking windows build on the disc

2015-11-08 17:51:08	@Espyo	it's just that, so far, I only really documented or talked about the most interesting things
2015-11-08 17:51:11	@Espyo	but it has a lot of tiny things
2015-11-08 17:51:16	@Espyo	it'll take days to document it all
2015-11-08 17:51:20	Yoshi2	I guess the devs didn't have proper dev kits when most of the development was done
2015-11-08 17:51:28	@Espyo	but it has more unused content than your average game, that's for sure
2015-11-08 17:51:40	@Espyo	if you consider the average game to have like 1 unused level, 2 unused powerups, stuff like that

2015-11-08 21:06:17	@Espyo	well, yeah, they are
2015-11-08 21:06:26	@Espyo	it's a .bfres file
2015-11-08 21:06:33	@Espyo	you can only really open it on 3DS Max with a script somebody made

2015-11-08 21:07:47	ScruffyChat	Never mind then
2015-11-08 21:08:28	@Espyo	I can export it to like .obj

2015-11-08 21:10:11	@Espyo	all righty

2015-11-08 21:10:27	@Espyo	because... it's kinda weird
2015-11-08 21:10:31	ScruffyChat	thanks
2015-11-08 21:10:32	@Espyo	the textures are inside the .bfres
2015-11-08 21:10:37	@Espyo	but the .bfres is also the model
2015-11-08 21:10:46	@Espyo	so it's both a model format and an archive for animations, textures, etc.
2015-11-08 21:10:55	@Espyo	plus the textures are in .gtx, so you need to convert to .dds and then .png
2015-11-08 21:10:58	@Espyo	I can send you the .pngs right away
2015-11-08 21:11:03	@Espyo	probably only like 3/4 textures

2015-11-08 21:42:30	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Yellow%20Wollywog.DAE it gave a warning, but let's see if it works
2015-11-08 21:42:58	@Espyo	here's .3DS: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Yellow%20Wollywog.3DS
2015-11-08 21:47:38	ScruffyChat	Aha, 3DS was successful!
2015-11-08 21:47:41	ScruffyChat	Thanks Espyo!
2015-11-08 21:48:59	Nvortex	huh this is weird
2015-11-08 21:49:35	Nvortex	the demo from e3 2012 might be newer than the gameplay shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCwgAsMcgVc
2015-11-08 21:49:50	Nvortex	the way they walked is like in pikmin 2
2015-11-08 21:50:07	Nvortex	and the pikmin also moved really weird
2015-11-08 21:50:23	Nvortex	like more stiff but the p,ayable demo is more like the final game
2015-11-08 21:50:27	@Espyo	nice
2015-11-08 21:50:29	@Espyo	you're welcome
2015-11-08 21:51:20	ScruffyChat	Wow, there are a lot of differences in that video

2015-11-08 22:11:48	Nvortex	the result screen was different
2015-11-08 22:12:10	Nvortex	the medals were different
2015-11-08 22:13:27	Nvortex	the mawdad made different noises
2015-11-08 22:13:35	ScruffyChat	Alph made different noises
2015-11-08 22:13:57	ScruffyChat	In the second to last video you sent, when Alph is trapped in the Aristocrab's bubble
2015-11-08 22:14:04	ScruffyChat	You can hear him, his voice is lower

2015-11-08 22:15:14	Nvortex	back then, there was no "hiding" position (animation?)
2015-11-08 22:17:41	Nvortex	the mawdad had a different death animation
2015-11-08 22:18:15	Nvortex	and his mouth opened in a really weird way (maybe it still does in the final game but the different camera angle doesnt let you do that)
2015-11-08 22:20:07	Nvortex	do beacons leave a trail while the captains walk?
2015-11-08 22:24:11	ScruffyChat	brb

2015-11-09 22:13:51	@PikFan	okay, what about?
2015-11-09 22:14:22	@Espyo	any problems?
2015-11-09 22:14:33	@Espyo	I think it looks okay, but it's a bit rough around some points
2015-11-09 22:14:41	@Espyo	because the in-game textures have a LOT more than what you can normally see
2015-11-09 22:15:04	@PikFan	the corridor to the Meerslug's arena is a bit disjointed
2015-11-09 22:15:09	@PikFan	otherwise it looks fine
2015-11-09 22:15:14	@Espyo	trust me, it matches exactly how it is in-game
2015-11-09 22:15:27	@Espyo	(exactly with an average error of 3-4 pixels)
2015-11-09 22:15:29	@PikFan	then the game is an idiot
2015-11-09 22:15:44	@Espyo	told ya, the textures are bigger than what you can "unlock" on the radar
2015-11-09 22:15:46	@PikFan	or rather, the game files
2015-11-09 22:15:56	@Espyo	if we could unlock it all, I'm sure you'd see ugly overlaps
2015-11-09 22:16:10	@PikFan	[[Tropical Wilds]]
2015-11-09 22:16:11	Testyo	"Tropical_Wilds" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Tropical_Wilds
2015-11-09 22:16:28	@Espyo	I guess I should cut it further though
2015-11-09 22:16:31	@Espyo	it looks ridiculous as is
2015-11-09 22:16:36	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-11-09 22:16:39	@PikFan	that's why
2015-11-09 22:16:54	@Espyo	plus I already cut some, like Alph's first tunnel vs the main portion of the area
2015-11-09 22:17:26	@Espyo	I mean, those two bits overlap too
2015-11-09 22:17:29	@Espyo	I faded between the two of them
2015-11-09 22:17:32	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-09 22:17:45	@PikFan	could you show me?
2015-11-09 22:17:51	@PikFan	like, the whole map, with nothing faded out
2015-11-09 22:18:19	@Espyo	sure
2015-11-09 22:19:27	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Tropical%20Wilds%20map%20overlaps.png
2015-11-09 22:20:02	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-09 22:20:13	@PikFan	it's not really any different than the first one you showed me
2015-11-09 22:20:57	@Espyo	sure it is
2015-11-09 22:21:15	@Espyo	notice how much the SM's corridor eats up the main area
2015-11-09 22:21:55	@PikFan	uh
2015-11-09 22:22:12	@PikFan	the corridor itself doesn't look different
2015-11-09 22:22:18	@PikFan	are you talking about the stuff around it?
2015-11-09 22:22:33	@Espyo	are you sure you opened the new image?
2015-11-09 22:22:37	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-09 22:22:43	@PikFan	the one with the white background
2015-11-09 22:22:51	@Espyo	(should be transparent background)
2015-11-09 22:22:59	@Espyo	the tunnel and the blackness that surrounds it
2015-11-09 22:23:03	@Espyo	it overlaps the main area's texture
2015-11-09 22:23:38	@PikFan	oh, the blackness
2015-11-09 22:23:42	@PikFan	yeah, I see it
2015-11-09 22:23:43	@Espyo	what I did for the first image I made was cut the corridor by a lot
2015-11-09 22:23:53	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-09 22:24:01	@Espyo	I'll cut it even more
2015-11-09 22:24:04	@Espyo	looks stupid without
2015-11-09 22:24:05	@PikFan	I just now noticed that the corridor is also slightly longer
2015-11-09 22:24:11	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-09 22:24:17	@PikFan	I'm 15 and I already have poor vision ._.
2015-11-09 22:25:32	@PikFan	I hope the maps in P4 are more seamless
2015-11-09 22:25:39	@Espyo	okay, I think everything looks good now
2015-11-09 22:25:53	@Espyo	heh, your vision's probably fine
2015-11-09 22:26:00	@Espyo	...man, it feels like it was just months ago that you were 12
2015-11-09 22:26:12	@PikFan	same, except that you were... 19
2015-11-09 22:26:17	@PikFan	or 20
2015-11-09 22:26:19	@PikFan	can't remember
2015-11-09 22:26:20	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-09 22:26:20	@Espyo	lol I was thinking that
2015-11-09 22:26:30	@Espyo	 20, if it's the same amount
2015-11-09 22:26:30	-->	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.lo.zpv) has joined #pikipedia
2015-11-09 22:26:31	@Espyo	geez
2015-11-09 22:26:31	@PikFan	time flies
2015-11-09 22:26:34	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2015-11-09 22:26:38	@Espyo	good thing age feels like only a number
2015-11-09 22:26:39	ScruffyChat	Hi!
2015-11-09 22:26:44	@Espyo	I don't feel any different than when I was 20
2015-11-09 22:26:45	@Espyo	hey
2015-11-09 22:26:58	@PikFan	I can't wait to not be a teenager
2015-11-09 22:27:05	@Espyo	oh, you'll love it
2015-11-09 22:27:09	@Espyo	and also loathe it
2015-11-09 22:27:12	@PikFan	not to deal with responsibilities, but to get out of hormones
2015-11-09 22:27:15	ScruffyChat	Listen to him
2015-11-09 22:27:28	@PikFan	I'm already dreading college
2015-11-09 22:27:34	@PikFan	heck, I've BEEN dreading college
2015-11-09 22:27:39	ScruffyChat	Don't
2015-11-09 22:27:43	@Espyo	make the most out of it
2015-11-09 22:27:44	ScruffyChat	It's great
2015-11-09 22:27:47	Testyo	...what to be adding more prestige upgrades
2015-11-09 22:27:55	@Espyo	I'm not going to be the mister goody-two-shoes that says college is important
2015-11-09 22:28:05	@Espyo	instead, I'll tell you that college, whether you like it or not, spawns a little paper that you need
2015-11-09 22:28:07	@PikFan	please add upgrades to my life that make it better Testyo
2015-11-09 22:28:08	Testyo	get and transform place things on my computer that are ready to be imported to do something?
2015-11-09 22:28:39	ScruffyChat	College still holds a lot of valuable info though
2015-11-09 22:28:47	@Espyo	if you're lucky
2015-11-09 22:28:49	@Espyo	wasn't my experience
2015-11-09 22:28:53	@PikFan	I like to learn
2015-11-09 22:28:55	@Espyo	half of the classes were pointless
2015-11-09 22:28:58	@PikFan	just don't like doing work :P
2015-11-09 22:29:01	ScruffyChat	If you're a rising musician in the US, you need college
2015-11-09 22:29:04	@PikFan	but don't we all
2015-11-09 22:29:04	@Espyo	a tenth was almost exactly what I will never be doing
2015-11-09 22:29:12	@Espyo	only a bit was actually fun or useful
2015-11-09 22:29:14	ScruffyChat	Although I'll agree I'm not gonna use half of what I learn
2015-11-09 22:29:37	@PikFan	I want to go into astrophysics so I'll probably be using half as well
2015-11-09 22:29:41	ScruffyChat	Although I guess it's nice to know, and if it's not so nice then it's easy to forgot
2015-11-09 22:29:43	@Espyo	maybe knowing the very basics of setting up a network will be helpful in several years time, for like one scenario
2015-11-09 22:29:54	@Espyo	but I will NEVER need to know how the bloody heat transfers between two metal sheets
2015-11-09 22:30:07	@PikFan	sure you do
2015-11-09 22:30:11	@PikFan	when you need to fix a computer
2015-11-09 22:30:16	@Espyo	ain't what I do
2015-11-09 22:30:16	@PikFan	</sarcasm>
2015-11-09 22:30:19	@Espyo	maybe
2015-11-09 22:30:27	@Espyo	if I make it so that on the engine
2015-11-09 22:30:34	@Espyo	Red Pikmin transfer heat realistically to surfaces to melt them
2015-11-09 22:30:41	@PikFan	interesting
2015-11-09 22:30:45	@Espyo	like those bees that melt wasps by suffocating them and generating heat
2015-11-09 22:30:50	@PikFan	oh, Scruffy kinda already has that
2015-11-09 22:30:54	@PikFan	except they just carry fire
2015-11-09 22:31:00	@Espyo	heh, nice
2015-11-09 22:31:01	@PikFan	with their flowers
2015-11-09 22:31:18	@PikFan	same for the other types: Yellows with electricity and Blues with water
2015-11-09 22:31:37	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Tropical%20Wilds%20map%202.png I think this is good to go
2015-11-09 22:32:03	@PikFan	yeah, that's better
2015-11-09 22:32:05	ScruffyChat	Nice!
2015-11-09 22:32:12	ScruffyChat	It's so detailed
2015-11-09 22:32:25	@PikFan	originally the corridor was longer and it was cutting into the main part of the area
2015-11-09 22:32:38	@PikFan	so he shortened it
2015-11-09 22:32:49	@Espyo	mhm
2015-11-09 22:32:52	@Espyo	but it feels just right now
2015-11-09 22:32:54	@Espyo	I don't cut TOO much
2015-11-09 22:32:56	@PikFan	I agree
2015-11-09 22:33:00	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-09 22:33:09	@PikFan	now, to do the other areas...
2015-11-09 22:33:16	@Espyo	but I cut just enough that the map doesn't look like a kindergartener's cut-out-pieces-of-magazines-and-stich-them-together art project
2015-11-09 22:33:19	@Espyo	*stitch
2015-11-09 22:33:23	@Espyo	aye aye
2015-11-09 22:33:32	@PikFan	well, one's enough for today
2015-11-09 22:33:46	ScruffyChat	I had an idea the other day
2015-11-09 22:33:52	@PikFan	oh, yeah, there's something I needed to ask
2015-11-09 22:33:53	ScruffyChat	For Pikipedia
2015-11-09 22:34:08	ScruffyChat	Oh, your question first
2015-11-09 22:34:16	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-09 22:34:33	@PikFan	on {{button}} do we really need the Classic Controller buttons?
2015-11-09 22:34:34	Testyo	"button" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:button
2015-11-09 22:34:57	@PikFan	I don't know if you can play the NPC! games with the Classic Controller
2015-11-09 22:35:02	@PikFan	I'm assuming you can't
2015-11-09 22:35:09	@Espyo	not going to go play Metroid Prime 3 now, so might as well do the next area
2015-11-09 22:35:23	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-11-09 22:35:30	@Espyo	pretty sure you can't
2015-11-09 22:35:39	@Espyo	they probably just came from whatever template we shamelessly ripped
2015-11-09 22:35:45	@Espyo	I was thinking of using P2/3 textures, though
2015-11-09 22:35:47	@PikFan	thanks Mario Wiki
2015-11-09 22:35:55	@Espyo	along the Koppaite font, I found a font with the button symbols, in P3
2015-11-09 22:35:57	@Espyo	so we can use that
2015-11-09 22:36:02	@Espyo	and P2 also has the symbols somewhere
2015-11-09 22:36:05	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-09 22:36:10	@Espyo	I'll give it a try, some day
2015-11-09 22:36:15	@Espyo	your idea, ScruffyChat?
2015-11-09 22:36:30	ScruffyChat	It might take up too much space, and I wouldn't know how to do it
2015-11-09 22:36:41	ScruffyChat	But I was thinking some day we could create something like a poll
2015-11-09 22:36:58	ScruffyChat	In which people drag and drop items and enemies onto an image of an area map
2015-11-09 22:37:08	ScruffyChat	And make little Mission Mode ideas to submit
2015-11-09 22:37:17	@Espyo	phoo boy
2015-11-09 22:37:22	@Espyo	that'd be fun... but incredibly hard
2015-11-09 22:37:28	ScruffyChat	I thought so
2015-11-09 22:37:37	@Espyo	it'd be easier to finish the engine and let people create their own
2015-11-09 22:37:42	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-09 22:37:42	@Espyo	...which is the plan, but, yeah
2015-11-09 22:37:50	@Espyo	the dragging part is probably easy
2015-11-09 22:37:53	@Espyo	 1, 2 days to make
2015-11-09 22:38:00	@Espyo	but... sending that info, storing it, and using it?
2015-11-09 22:38:04	@Espyo	that'd be nuts
2015-11-09 22:38:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-09 22:38:20	@PikFan	I like the idea, but it sounds hard
2015-11-09 22:38:31	@PikFan	Espyo, why does code have to be hard
2015-11-09 22:38:39	@Espyo	remember Spider-Man?
2015-11-09 22:38:49	@Espyo	"With great power comes great responsibility."
2015-11-09 22:39:26	@PikFan	in other words, the makers of code don't want people creating trash everywhere
2015-11-09 22:39:37	ScruffyChat	I shouldn't really start thinking about that anyway until we see if P4 will already have a feature like that
2015-11-09 22:39:56	@PikFan	two games I'm most hyped for:
2015-11-09 22:39:57	ScruffyChat	That'd be glorious
2015-11-09 22:40:00	@PikFan	P4, and Zelda U
2015-11-09 22:40:05	ScruffyChat	Super Pikmin Maker
2015-11-09 22:40:10	@Espyo	more like "you can do anything with code, but because of that, you have to do a lot of typing to get EXACTLY what you want"
2015-11-09 22:40:21	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-09 22:40:27	ScruffyChat	Same with music
2015-11-09 22:40:34	@Espyo	I can tell Nintendo used fancy tools while developing P3
2015-11-09 22:40:41	@Espyo	it shows just from how the files are made
2015-11-09 22:40:41	ScruffyChat	You can make any sound, but you need a LOT of instruction to fine-tune it
2015-11-09 22:40:46	@PikFan	what happens if you accidentally type a colon when you're supposed to use a semicolon
2015-11-09 22:40:46	@Espyo	I mean, they probably used fancy tools all the time
2015-11-09 22:40:49	@PikFan	or the other way around
2015-11-09 22:40:56	@Espyo	but the P3 ones seem like they were made to be a LOT fancier
2015-11-09 22:41:14	@Espyo	luckily, it's not that big of a deal as the internet would let you believe
2015-11-09 22:41:14	ScruffyChat	Like what kind of fancy tools?
2015-11-09 22:41:25	@Espyo	if you type a comma, you won't be searching for it for 4 days
2015-11-09 22:41:38	@Espyo	you'll just get an immediate error "comma found when I expected something like a semicolon"
2015-11-09 22:41:45	@Espyo	depends on the language, but that's true for most languages
2015-11-09 22:41:50	@Espyo	in-house tools
2015-11-09 22:41:53	@Espyo	an area editor
2015-11-09 22:41:55	@Espyo	enemy AI editor
2015-11-09 22:41:55	@Espyo	etc.
2015-11-09 22:41:56	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-09 22:42:24	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-11-09 22:42:26	@PikFan	okay, I can't tell if it's raining or hailing outside
2015-11-09 22:42:32	@PikFan	because it's also sunny
2015-11-09 22:42:53	@PikFan	I'm not seeing any hail clumps on the ground, so I guess it's just raining
2015-11-09 22:42:55	ScruffyChat	I could tell from the model of the Yellow Wollywog that the animators used animation drivers, not just armatures
2015-11-09 22:43:02	ScruffyChat	I just learned about that in Blender
2015-11-09 22:43:08	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-09 22:43:08	@Espyo	nice
2015-11-09 22:43:13	@PikFan	thanks for making that preview
2015-11-09 22:43:19	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-11-09 22:43:23	ScruffyChat	Any thoughts?
2015-11-09 22:43:36	@PikFan	were you going to add the Spiderwort and the Pellet Posy at some point?
2015-11-09 22:43:43	ScruffyChat	Oh shoot, I forgot
2015-11-09 22:43:48	@PikFan	no worries
2015-11-09 22:44:00	ScruffyChat	I'll get on that... at some point
2015-11-09 22:44:11	ScruffyChat	This week is heavy, maybe the second heaviest week yet
2015-11-09 22:44:25	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-09 22:44:39	@PikFan	well, it's fine, it already looks gorgeous as-is
2015-11-09 22:44:44	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-11-09 22:44:55	ScruffyChat	I wanted to ask, since you had ask for me to post updates
2015-11-09 22:45:02	@PikFan	right
2015-11-09 22:45:03	ScruffyChat	Did you want to learn how I did it?
2015-11-09 22:45:12	@PikFan	sure
2015-11-09 22:45:28	@PikFan	I may as well, since I might use Blender one day myself
2015-11-09 22:45:35	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-11-09 22:45:47	ScruffyChat	It might take more than the chat window, I'll have a lot of explaining to do
2015-11-09 22:45:55	ScruffyChat	It'd really be better if I had a video
2015-11-09 22:46:34	ScruffyChat	Or if we could Skype or something
2015-11-09 22:46:41	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-09 22:46:59	ScruffyChat	But I could send screenshots I suppose
2015-11-09 22:47:05	@PikFan	so do you mold each object on different layers, then combine all the layers together?
2015-11-09 22:47:18	ScruffyChat	Correction: I should do that
2015-11-09 22:47:31	ScruffyChat	I don't because I've neglected it with every render
2015-11-09 22:47:39	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-11-09 22:47:41	ScruffyChat	And I don't know how to combine the layers together
2015-11-09 22:47:57	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-09 22:48:21	@PikFan	so do you start out with a basic shape, like a plane in this case, and gradually work your way up?
2015-11-09 22:48:31	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-09 22:48:48	ScruffyChat	Hold on, I'll pull up the picture for reference
2015-11-09 22:49:48	ScruffyChat	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/3/3a/Torrid_Desert_Preview_by_Scruffy.png
2015-11-09 22:50:11	ScruffyChat	So, I actually started with the Yellow Wollywog, since I asked Espyo for the model

2015-11-09 22:51:44	ScruffyChat	I'm so sorry
2015-11-09 22:51:57	@PikFan	no, no, it's all good
2015-11-09 22:52:13	ScruffyChat	did anyone say anything?
2015-11-09 22:52:18	@PikFan	no
2015-11-09 22:52:23	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-11-09 22:52:42	ScruffyChat	So the DAE file for the Yellow Wollywog had its textures
2015-11-09 22:52:44	ScruffyChat	And the 3DS file had its model
2015-11-09 22:52:56	ScruffyChat	Normally they all come in one package, but exporting is weird
2015-11-09 22:53:09	@PikFan	what is a 3DS file, anyway
2015-11-09 22:53:25	@PikFan	because I hear it and think Nintendo 3DS, but I know that's not right
2015-11-09 22:53:29	ScruffyChat	It's a file from 3DS Max, another 3D modelling program
2015-11-09 22:53:29	@PikFan	*see it
2015-11-09 22:53:49	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-09 22:54:07	ScruffyChat	Espyo uses that one, I use the free one because I'm a starving artist
2015-11-09 22:54:22	@Espyo	I don't /use/ that one
2015-11-09 22:54:23	@Espyo	I do
2015-11-09 22:54:24	@Espyo	but I don't
2015-11-09 22:54:29	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-09 22:54:34	@Espyo	I just use it to open the Pikmin 3 models
2015-11-09 22:54:37	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-09 22:54:45	@Espyo	if I ever need to work on anything modelling related, I use Blender
2015-11-09 22:54:49	@Espyo	even if my experience is tiny
2015-11-09 22:54:53	ScruffyChat	Cool!
2015-11-09 22:54:55	@Espyo	plus 3DS Max is so stupid
2015-11-09 22:55:00	ScruffyChat	Good to support Blender
2015-11-09 22:55:02	@Espyo	YOU CAN'T ROTATE THE CAMERA
2015-11-09 22:55:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-09 22:55:04	@Espyo	YOU CAN ONLY ORBIT IT
2015-11-09 22:55:06	@Espyo	KAJSDAHSGDAIUSD6AS6D
2015-11-09 22:55:07	ScruffyChat	Wait wat
2015-11-09 22:55:16	ScruffyChat	Oh, I see
2015-11-09 22:55:26	@Espyo	if you try to rotate the camera up and down, it turns up and down
2015-11-09 22:55:33	@Espyo	like you would on an FPS
2015-11-09 22:55:35	@Espyo	looking up and down
2015-11-09 22:55:45	@Espyo	left and right? those just rotate your view counter/clockwise
2015-11-09 22:55:48	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it orbits around a point
2015-11-09 22:56:00	@Espyo	it's so incredibly frustrating to do the simplest things with
2015-11-09 22:56:05	ScruffyChat	The same in Blender, but there's a short way to rotate view instead
2015-11-09 22:56:10	ScruffyChat	Blender's all about keyboard shortcuts
2015-11-09 22:56:11	@Espyo	not to mention that the zoom is stupid in and of itself
2015-11-09 22:56:20	@Espyo	you hold down Alt, the mouse wheel's button, and move the mouse
2015-11-09 22:56:27	@Espyo	instead of, you know, rolling the mouse wheel
2015-11-09 22:56:36	@PikFan	14:55	Espyo	YOU CAN'T ROTATE THE CAMERA
2015-11-09 22:56:39	@PikFan	beautiful rant
2015-11-09 22:56:41	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, that's unbearable
2015-11-09 22:56:43	@PikFan	first thing I saw
2015-11-09 22:56:45	@Espyo	yeah, I don't know much about Blender, but I know it works a hell of a lot better in that regard
2015-11-09 22:56:53	ScruffyChat	Amen
2015-11-09 22:57:18	@Espyo	it makes me wonder why people use Max
2015-11-09 22:57:22	@Espyo	it has to have SOME redeeming qualities
2015-11-09 22:57:25	@Espyo	it looks complete, sure
2015-11-09 22:57:29	ScruffyChat	It looks pretty
2015-11-09 22:57:30	@Espyo	but not any more than the likes of Maya
2015-11-09 22:57:34	@Espyo	eh, that must be it
2015-11-09 22:57:45	ScruffyChat	But other programs can be pretty and work better
2015-11-09 22:58:16	ScruffyChat	Well anyway, yes, I started with this Wollywog model
2015-11-09 22:58:25	ScruffyChat	Interject at any time with questions
2015-11-09 22:58:30	@Espyo	oh yeah, I cut you off lol
2015-11-09 22:58:30	@Espyo	sorry
2015-11-09 22:58:38	ScruffyChat	Heh no problem
2015-11-09 22:59:04	ScruffyChat	The Wollywog is in "t-pose," meaning its limbs are outstretched so the animators can see its symmetry
2015-11-09 22:59:19	@PikFan	...okay, now it's DEFINITELY hailing
2015-11-09 22:59:26	ScruffyChat	Yikes
2015-11-09 22:59:48	@Espyo	pretty calm weather over here
2015-11-09 23:00:01	@Espyo	my weather always looks like it's the opposite of what people I'm talking to have
2015-11-09 23:00:22	ScruffyChat	There are about 7000 storms constantly on earth
2015-11-09 23:00:25	@Espyo	anyway, when I opened the model, I thought "man, that's too weird for a T-pose. Scruffy might have a hard time with this"
2015-11-09 23:00:39	@Espyo	well, that's the scary statistic of the day
2015-11-09 23:00:51	ScruffyChat	Most are just rain though
2015-11-09 23:01:06	ScruffyChat	And a majority are over water, not land
2015-11-09 23:01:14	ScruffyChat	Oh, yes, the t-pose
2015-11-09 23:02:00	ScruffyChat	It wouldn't be hard, but since the animators (or maybe 3DS Max?) used animation drivers and not a skeleton, I could not simply move the limbs
2015-11-09 23:02:19	@Espyo	ah, good
2015-11-09 23:02:25	@Espyo	question, why would a skeleton be worse?
2015-11-09 23:02:40	@Espyo	...before that: what are animation drivers, and how do they differ?
2015-11-09 23:02:45	ScruffyChat	It's not worse, but when you're animating, it gets clunky
2015-11-09 23:02:56	@Espyo	hm
2015-11-09 23:03:07	ScruffyChat	Basically, bones control the model
2015-11-09 23:03:13	ScruffyChat	And animation drivers control bones
2015-11-09 23:03:38	ScruffyChat	So you can make a few shapes that represent animation control, and then you clean up the whole process by hiding the skeleton
2015-11-09 23:04:00	ScruffyChat	For example, instead of having 2-4 bones to manipulate on a human arm
2015-11-09 23:04:18	ScruffyChat	you have one or two shapes that you can move to contort the arm naturally
2015-11-09 23:04:26	@Espyo	oh, I see
2015-11-09 23:04:48	ScruffyChat	But I'm not really an animator, I just stick to using bones in frozen scenes
2015-11-09 23:05:30	ScruffyChat	But it didn't matter either way, because Blender recognized the animation drivers but didn't recognize what they were for
2015-11-09 23:05:38	@Espyo	nice
2015-11-09 23:05:45	@PikFan	okay, so that's the hardest I've ever seen it hail
2015-11-09 23:05:54	@PikFan	main courtyard is coated in hailstones
2015-11-09 23:06:01	ScruffyChat	Size?
2015-11-09 23:06:01	@PikFan	and now it's all melting
2015-11-09 23:06:06	ScruffyChat	Eugh
2015-11-09 23:06:09	ScruffyChat	Poor Pikmin
2015-11-09 23:06:17	@PikFan	I live in Oregon, so hailstones don't get that big
2015-11-09 23:06:39	@PikFan	but they're pea sized, it looks life
2015-11-09 23:06:44	@PikFan	bigger than normal
2015-11-09 23:06:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-09 23:06:55	ScruffyChat	Sorry, that's rough
2015-11-09 23:07:08	@PikFan	it's no biggie, it's stopped hailing
2015-11-09 23:07:12	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-11-09 23:07:13	@PikFan	but wow that was intense
2015-11-09 23:07:18	@PikFan	lots of kids were freaking out
2015-11-09 23:07:22	@PikFan	...and taking vidoes
2015-11-09 23:07:24	@PikFan	*videos
2015-11-09 23:07:31	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-09 23:08:10	ScruffyChat	Well
2015-11-09 23:08:21	ScruffyChat	I'm glad it's over for you
2015-11-09 23:08:29	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-09 23:08:39	@PikFan	it's usually just rain, rain, and more rain
2015-11-09 23:08:44	ScruffyChat	Man
2015-11-09 23:08:46	@PikFan	hardly anything exciting like this
2015-11-09 23:08:50	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-09 23:09:20	ScruffyChat	Should I continue?
2015-11-09 23:09:38	@PikFan	if you want to
2015-11-09 23:09:49	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry if this is hard to understand
2015-11-09 23:10:05	ScruffyChat	believe me, it's still hard for me to understand
2015-11-09 23:10:54	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-09 23:11:14	ScruffyChat	But since the Wollywog had no recognized skeleton, it was just a 3D shape
2015-11-09 23:11:20	@PikFan	I'll probably just watch a tutorial video for Blender and then leave it halfway through very confused
2015-11-09 23:11:20	ScruffyChat	A bunch of polygons
2015-11-09 23:11:28	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-09 23:12:00	@PikFan	so you had to somehow manipulate those polygons, since there wasn't a skeleton
2015-11-09 23:13:12	ScruffyChat	Yes, I had to move each polygon of its legs manually
2015-11-09 23:13:17	ScruffyChat	Or, groups of polygons
2015-11-09 23:13:22	@PikFan	sounds like a pain
2015-11-09 23:13:30	ScruffyChat	It's a fun pain though
2015-11-09 23:13:37	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-09 23:13:57	ScruffyChat	I used a reference and just move the back feet, then back legs, then front
2015-11-09 23:14:12	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-09 23:14:33	@PikFan	and then, after that, did you make the water? or does water come later?
2015-11-09 23:18:21	ScruffyChat	Water comes later, first I had to test the lighting
2015-11-09 23:18:30	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-09 23:18:31	ScruffyChat	The background is a tropical beach with palm trees
2015-11-09 23:18:41	@PikFan	is it an HDRI file?
2015-11-09 23:19:25	ScruffyChat	Mhm!
2015-11-09 23:19:32	ScruffyChat	See you're learning
2015-11-09 23:19:44	@PikFan	heh, yay
2015-11-09 23:20:36	@PikFan	so you just figure out the lighting from the image, and you base the rest of the scene off that?
2015-11-09 23:20:42	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-09 23:20:47	UltraMario	does anyone here have netflix?
2015-11-09 23:20:49	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-09 23:20:53	@PikFan	why?
2015-11-09 23:20:59	UltraMario	i need help with something
2015-11-09 23:21:08	@PikFan	okay, what's wrong?
2015-11-09 23:21:27	UltraMario	i wanna if there's a way to turn off whatever makes it so the intro is skipped on a tv show :p
2015-11-09 23:21:50	UltraMario	recently when ive been watching goosebumps it just goes right to where the episode starts
2015-11-09 23:22:13	@PikFan	not sure
2015-11-09 23:22:16	UltraMario	i dont mind watching the intro tbh so if theres a way i wanna know how to turn it off
2015-11-09 23:22:17	UltraMario	hmm
2015-11-09 23:26:06	@PikFan	I should get going
2015-11-09 23:26:11	@PikFan	probably won't be on later
2015-11-09 23:26:13	UltraMario	seeya

2015-11-09 23:35:27	evilmanimani	I have some of the Pikmin 2 e-reader cards and I recorded some footage of the minigames

2015-11-09 23:35:45	@Espyo	like
2015-11-09 23:35:47	@Espyo	almost useless
2015-11-09 23:35:56	evilmanimani	my footage isn't very good, but it's something
2015-11-09 23:35:59	evilmanimani	and it has more levels
2015-11-09 23:36:25	@Espyo	looks plenty good to me
2015-11-09 23:36:25	evilmanimani	I only have the 3 cards that came with Pikmin 2
2015-11-09 23:36:32	@Espyo	you know, not capture-card good, but still pretty good
2015-11-09 23:36:45	@Espyo	may wanna submit it on /r/Nintendo too
2015-11-09 23:36:53	evilmanimani	good idea, I'll do that
2015-11-09 23:37:02	evilmanimani	think the title is good enough for /r/Nintendo?
2015-11-09 23:37:13	@Espyo	hm, I think so
2015-11-09 23:38:17	evilmanimani	hopefully you can use that on the pikipedia
2015-11-09 23:38:20	@Espyo	man, the puzzles actually look like they're fun
2015-11-09 23:38:26	@Espyo	yeah, we can probably embed the videos
2015-11-09 23:38:33	@Espyo	there's no real good footage
2015-11-09 23:38:35	@Espyo	so this works well
2015-11-09 23:38:36	@Espyo	nice job
2015-11-09 23:38:39	evilmanimani	thanks
2015-11-09 23:39:03	evilmanimani	it drove me crazy there wasn't real footage so I bought a GBA SP and a JPN e-reader
2015-11-09 23:39:15	evilmanimani	and I really wanted to see what it was like
2015-11-09 23:39:35	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-09 23:39:40	@Espyo	I'd love to recreate that one day
2015-11-09 23:39:46	@Espyo	like as an HTML5 game
2015-11-09 23:40:24	evilmanimani	oooh that'd be awesome
2015-11-09 23:40:29	evilmanimani	could totally work too
2015-11-09 23:41:01	@Espyo	yeah

2015-11-09 23:51:14	@Espyo	but they always work
2015-11-09 23:53:55	evilmanimani	oh yeah, I mean share it with them whenever
2015-11-09 23:54:07	evilmanimani	cause I don't know how to edit the pikipedia and all that
2015-11-09 23:54:35	@Espyo	no worries

2015-11-10 01:27:20	@PikFan	okay, so I lied
2015-11-10 01:27:25	@PikFan	I AM here, I guess
2015-11-10 01:27:42	@PikFan	I thought I wouldn't be able to use the computer when I got come
2015-11-10 01:27:45	@PikFan	*home
2015-11-10 01:27:49	@PikFan	I thought wrong
2015-11-10 01:28:22	ScruffyChat	Oh okay
2015-11-10 01:28:24	ScruffyChat	Hi!
2015-11-10 01:30:07	@PikFan	forgot to mention this, but I created an image category for PCW images
2015-11-10 01:31:34	ScruffyChat	I saw
2015-11-10 01:31:40	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-10 01:33:07	@PikFan	oh boy, lots of pages that have cave infoboxes
2015-11-10 01:33:36	@PikFan	good thing it's not 800 or so, like {{noreal}}
2015-11-10 01:33:37	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-10 01:33:41	@PikFan	it's less than 150
2015-11-10 01:36:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 01:36:31	ScruffyChat	What's the matter with the cave infoboxes?
2015-11-10 01:36:47	@PikFan	their third parameter, "gimmicks"
2015-11-10 01:37:20	@PikFan	it used to be "treasure" for ages but then it was changed to "gimmicks"
2015-11-10 01:37:42	@PikFan	imo, a better word would be "collectibles"
2015-11-10 01:38:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 01:38:21	@PikFan	but I also want to go through and change the parameter itself to "collectible," because right now it's "treasure"
2015-11-10 01:38:35	@PikFan	so there isn't that inconsistency
2015-11-10 01:38:44	ScruffyChat	Good idea
2015-11-10 01:42:34	ScruffyChat	brb
2015-11-10 01:42:48	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-10 01:47:23	@PikFan	it'd be extremely convenient to have hazard and obstacle icons on Fanon...
2015-11-10 01:47:45	@PikFan	sadly, with so many potential new hazards/obstacles, making icons for each just isn't feasible
2015-11-10 01:48:23	@PikFan	I'm kinda glad that the Pikmin series doesn't have many games
2015-11-10 01:48:37	@PikFan	it allows us to go very indepth on subjects
2015-11-10 01:49:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 01:50:00	ScruffyChat	I could make icons for hazards
2015-11-10 01:50:04	ScruffyChat	And obstacles
2015-11-10 01:50:10	ScruffyChat	And just make new ones as they arrive
2015-11-10 01:50:12	@PikFan	really? neat
2015-11-10 01:50:19	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-11-10 01:50:29	@PikFan	I mean, you're totally not required to do this
2015-11-10 01:50:41	@PikFan	if you want to, sure
2015-11-10 01:50:48	@PikFan	I'm just saying, you don't have to
2015-11-10 01:51:03	ScruffyChat	I do like the idea of it, I think it'd be fun
2015-11-10 01:51:11	ScruffyChat	Are there really that many hazards?
2015-11-10 01:51:34	@PikFan	the most common ones are acid, snow/ice, lava, sand/dirt, etc, etc
2015-11-10 01:52:17	@PikFan	if you were going to make obstacle icons, you'd want to make them in a similar style to Pikipedia's http://www.pikminwiki.com/Obstacle
2015-11-10 01:53:15	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 01:53:31	ScruffyChat	I can do that
2015-11-10 01:53:35	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-10 01:53:43	@PikFan	I forgot what program Espyo used to make them
2015-11-10 01:53:46	ScruffyChat	I can do it in Blender
2015-11-10 01:53:52	@PikFan	I think it was GIMP? I can't remember
2015-11-10 01:53:57	ScruffyChat	Probably
2015-11-10 01:54:00	ScruffyChat	I have GIMP too
2015-11-10 01:54:05	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-10 01:54:09	@PikFan	GIMP is grear
2015-11-10 01:54:11	@PikFan	*great
2015-11-10 01:54:19	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 01:54:20	@PikFan	I used it to make my recolors of enemies
2015-11-10 01:54:28	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-11-10 01:56:38	@PikFan	have I ever mentioned how the middle click is very useful
2015-11-10 01:56:55	@PikFan	much much faster than going right click + open in new tab
2015-11-10 01:58:17	ScruffyChat	I need to use my mouse more often
2015-11-10 01:58:21	ScruffyChat	I just have a trackpad
2015-11-10 01:58:32	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-10 01:58:51	@PikFan	yeah, you said you use a Macbook, right?
2015-11-10 01:59:03	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-11-10 01:59:20	ScruffyChat	It's not the computer for Blender, or Pikmin engine, or GIMP, or any of this stuff
2015-11-10 01:59:24	ScruffyChat	But I manage
2015-11-10 01:59:30	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-10 02:00:06	@PikFan	if you had a better computer, it wouldn't take very long for things to render, would it?
2015-11-10 02:00:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 02:00:37	ScruffyChat	Things that take me 30 minutes might take others 3 minutes
2015-11-10 02:00:40	ScruffyChat	Or 30 seconds
2015-11-10 02:00:47	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-10 02:00:48	ScruffyChat	It all depends on your processor and graphics car
2015-11-10 02:00:52	ScruffyChat	card*
2015-11-10 02:01:10	ScruffyChat	And I don't have a fancy type of either of those
2015-11-10 02:01:27	@PikFan	I bet on a good computer it'd make even the prologue film look puny
2015-11-10 02:01:56	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, definitely
2015-11-10 02:02:10	ScruffyChat	I could add all these cool smoke effects and reflections
2015-11-10 02:02:24	ScruffyChat	And make Earth look more like planet Earth
2015-11-10 02:02:26	@PikFan	why does money have to torture us so
2015-11-10 02:02:29	ScruffyChat	I mean, it's passable now
2015-11-10 02:02:34	ScruffyChat	But it could look a lot better
2015-11-10 02:03:26	ScruffyChat	Okay so, icons are just 48x48?
2015-11-10 02:03:35	@PikFan	looks like
2015-11-10 02:04:01	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I can do that
2015-11-10 02:04:10	@PikFan	great
2015-11-10 02:04:59	ScruffyChat	Want me to try a test with... fire?
2015-11-10 02:05:24	@PikFan	sure, go for it
2015-11-10 02:05:33	@PikFan	like, a hazard icon?
2015-11-10 02:06:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 02:07:14	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-10 02:09:44	evilmanimani	hey pikmin people
2015-11-10 02:09:52	@PikFan	hi
2015-11-10 02:09:55	evilmanimani	I uploaded new footage of the Pikmin 2 e-reader games
2015-11-10 02:09:57	evilmanimani	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzCK61jrK_SY2DSA94jVnx0sRCKOjXKo0
2015-11-10 02:10:06	evilmanimani	could someone add these to the Pikipedia?
2015-11-10 02:11:59	evilmanimani	since there was almost no videos, I thought I'd record them
2015-11-10 02:12:26	evilmanimani	And all you need is a JP GCN, JP Pikmin 2, JP e-reader, Pikmin 2 e-reader cards, GBA-to-GCN cable and any region GBA...

2015-11-10 02:17:04	@PikFan	is it your router?

2015-11-10 02:25:05	evilmanimani	the e-reader games are pretty cool, eh?
2015-11-10 02:25:19	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-10 02:26:20	evilmanimani	too bad it's crazy hard to get all the cards
2015-11-10 02:26:54	evilmanimani	like $15 for only 5 cards on ebay right now
2015-11-10 02:28:04	evilmanimani	could you add these videos to the e-reader pikipedia page?
2015-11-10 02:28:47	@PikFan	I could
2015-11-10 02:28:52	evilmanimani	these are the levels that come with the original 3 cards
2015-11-10 02:29:03	@PikFan	but I'm going to see what Espyo says first
2015-11-10 02:29:04	evilmanimani	thanks, I don't know how to do it
2015-11-10 02:29:10	evilmanimani	he added one already, actually
2015-11-10 02:29:27	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-11-10 02:29:36	@PikFan	did he ask you to put all of them on there?
2015-11-10 02:29:51	evilmanimani	no, I think that he didn't see the other videos when I first gave it to him
2015-11-10 02:29:59	evilmanimani	plus he was about to go to sleep
2015-11-10 02:30:04	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-10 02:30:30	evilmanimani	it's okay if it doesn't go up, I just thought it would be a good addition to the pikipedia
2015-11-10 02:30:40	@PikFan	I'll add one of each
2015-11-10 02:31:26	evilmanimani	okay, these are levels 1-3 of the three different minigames
2015-11-10 02:31:35	@PikFan	right
2015-11-10 02:31:39	@PikFan	I'll just add level 1
2015-11-10 02:32:01	evilmanimani	feel free to download them and reupload to the official pikipedia youtube if that would be better for you guys
2015-11-10 02:32:33	evilmanimani	thanks a lot PikFan, I gotta go

2015-11-10 02:45:58	@PikFan	it looks alright
2015-11-10 02:46:30	@PikFan	though I'm not so sure about its shape
2015-11-10 02:46:42	@PikFan	looks a bit similar to a drop of water
2015-11-10 02:46:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah... a bit to droplet-y
2015-11-10 02:46:49	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-11-10 02:47:18	ScruffyChat	Okay, I could add some more spikes then
2015-11-10 02:47:30	@PikFan	did you see Espyo's fire hazard icon?
2015-11-10 02:47:47	@PikFan	it—and all the other hazard icons—are based off of P2's hazard icons
2015-11-10 02:53:53	ScruffyChat	Ohhh
2015-11-10 02:53:58	ScruffyChat	there are different icons
2015-11-10 02:54:07	ScruffyChat	I was looking at the one for fire /geyser/
2015-11-10 02:55:38	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-11-10 02:59:55	ScruffyChat	Should we just use those versions then?
2015-11-10 03:00:04	ScruffyChat	They seem to be really close to canon
2015-11-10 03:00:35	@PikFan	probably, yeah
2015-11-10 03:03:39	@PikFan	I'll talk to Espyo about it tomorrow

2015-11-10 03:16:34	@PikFan	and good luck with your presentation
2015-11-10 03:16:37	@PikFan	oh, thanks
2015-11-10 03:16:38	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-11-10 03:16:52	ScruffyChat	The concert's on thursday, there are just rehearsals throughout the week
2015-11-10 03:16:59	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-11-10 03:17:08	@PikFan	you made it sound like it was tomorrow :P
2015-11-10 03:17:25	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-10 03:17:32	ScruffyChat	Sorry :s
2015-11-10 03:17:46	ScruffyChat	It certainly feels like it's only a few moments away
2015-11-10 03:17:46	@PikFan	no, no, it's fine, don't worry about it
2015-11-10 03:17:53	ScruffyChat	I've been working on it since summer
2015-11-10 03:18:09	@PikFan	that big? wow
2015-11-10 03:18:21	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 03:18:33	ScruffyChat	this is probably the biggest part of my semester
2015-11-10 03:18:41	@PikFan	I can imagine
2015-11-10 03:18:51	@PikFan	well, I shouldn't be keeping you
2015-11-10 03:19:00	ScruffyChat	It's no trouble
2015-11-10 03:19:13	@PikFan	you sure? if you say so
2015-11-10 03:19:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah it's fine, it's just a matter of turning in for the night
2015-11-10 03:19:44	ScruffyChat	To make up for that one 4 AM night
2015-11-10 03:19:56	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-11-10 03:20:04	@PikFan	I did not expect you to stay up late
2015-11-10 03:20:07	ScruffyChat	I'm proud to say I quit Swarm Simulator after 11 hours of playing it
2015-11-10 03:20:15	@PikFan	awesome
2015-11-10 03:20:24	@PikFan	don't let it get to you like it did with me
2015-11-10 03:20:26	ScruffyChat	They weren't like Pikmin, you have no emotional attachment
2015-11-10 03:20:34	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-10 03:21:05	ScruffyChat	do you still play it
2015-11-10 03:21:05	@PikFan	I have nearly 2 unseptuagintillion meat
2015-11-10 03:21:14	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-10 03:21:23	ScruffyChat	what even does that number represent
2015-11-10 03:21:31	@PikFan	uh... let me check what power of ten that is
2015-11-10 03:22:32	@PikFan	10^213
2015-11-10 03:22:41	@PikFan	that's... humongous
2015-11-10 03:22:53	ScruffyChat	That's hilarious
2015-11-10 03:23:03	ScruffyChat	That we'd still name powers up ten at that point
2015-11-10 03:23:14	@PikFan	http://www.isthe.com/cgi-bin/chongo/number.cgi
2015-11-10 03:23:30	@PikFan	you can have names for even crazy numbers like 10^23534521 power
2015-11-10 03:23:39	ScruffyChat	I doubt there's even close to that much meat on Earth
2015-11-10 03:24:04	@PikFan	you kidding? there's not even that many elementary particles in the UNIVERSE
2015-11-10 03:24:15	@PikFan	like... only 10^80 iirc
2015-11-10 03:24:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 03:24:43	ScruffyChat	There's nothing physical that number represents
2015-11-10 03:24:45	ScruffyChat	Poor number
2015-11-10 03:24:57	ScruffyChat	I wonder where the Pikmin counter maxes out
2015-11-10 03:25:01	@PikFan	maybe the number of Planck volumes...?
2015-11-10 03:25:20	ScruffyChat	There should be infinite Planck volumes though
2015-11-10 03:25:29	ScruffyChat	Wait, no
2015-11-10 03:25:29	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYnSVjLtgeg
2015-11-10 03:25:34	ScruffyChat	That's planck frames
2015-11-10 03:26:20	@PikFan	apparently it's 4 billion something
2015-11-10 03:26:26	@PikFan	regarding the Pikmin cap
2015-11-10 03:27:18	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-10 03:27:55	ScruffyChat	Like 2/3 the Earth
2015-11-10 03:28:05	ScruffyChat	Earth's population of humans*
2015-11-10 03:28:11	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-10 03:28:56	@PikFan	"In some forms of quantum gravity, the Planck length is the length scale at which the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum effects, and it is impossible to determine the difference between two locations less than one Planck length apart."
2015-11-10 03:29:11	@PikFan	oh, so THAT'S why it's impossible to have lengths shorter than the Planck length
2015-11-10 03:29:17	@PikFan	well, you could
2015-11-10 03:29:22	@PikFan	but it'd be meaningless
2015-11-10 03:29:25	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-10 03:30:13	@PikFan	I love Planck units, because of how they're extreme maximums or minimums
2015-11-10 03:30:59	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 03:31:08	ScruffyChat	They're great for science fiction
2015-11-10 03:31:13	ScruffyChat	Which reminds me
2015-11-10 03:31:22	ScruffyChat	how are your fanfics going
2015-11-10 03:31:27	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-10 03:31:44	@PikFan	I started working on Mysterious World Chapter 5 some days ago
2015-11-10 03:32:14	@PikFan	hold on, brb
2015-11-10 03:32:41	@PikFan	not sure how long this'll take though
2015-11-10 03:33:21	ScruffyChat	No prob

2015-11-10 19:23:19	Klemen702	came back
2015-11-10 19:23:57	Yoshi2	wb
2015-11-10 19:24:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: I wonder if pikmin 3 has any files which describe alternative object placements for maps
2015-11-10 19:24:54	@Espyo	probably
2015-11-10 19:25:01	@Espyo	it's kinda hard to understand how those files work
2015-11-10 19:25:09	@Espyo	I THINK I've got them
2015-11-10 19:25:16	@Espyo	but I never looked too deep into it
2015-11-10 19:26:24	Yoshi2	that would be the closest thing we might have to an unused map
2015-11-10 19:26:33	@Espyo	mhm
2015-11-10 19:27:55	Yoshi2	though confirming that the object placements are unused will be a pain
2015-11-10 19:29:32	@Espyo	for sure...
2015-11-10 19:31:02	Yoshi2	could try to graph it out and put it over the maps to see what makes sense
2015-11-10 19:34:17	@Espyo	hm, good idea
2015-11-10 19:34:33	@Espyo	I like how my first reaction to that idea was "that is INSANELY difficult and specific, there's no way I'd be willing to do that!"
2015-11-10 19:34:59	@Espyo	and then I "oh. [[File:VoR paths.png]]
2015-11-10 19:34:59	Testyo	"File:VoR_paths.png" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:VoR_paths.png
2015-11-10 19:35:00	@Espyo	*"
2015-11-10 19:40:06	Yoshi2	nice, so each map has predetermined paths the pikmin will take when carrying stuff
2015-11-10 19:40:25	Yoshi2	that probably makes pathfinding easier
2015-11-10 19:43:00	@Espyo	ridiculously easier, I bet
2015-11-10 19:43:05	@Espyo	just use the...
2015-11-10 19:43:07	@Espyo	uh
2015-11-10 19:43:10	@Espyo	I learned this in high school
2015-11-10 19:43:13	@Espyo	the something algorithm
2015-11-10 19:43:16	@Espyo	to find the shortest path
2015-11-10 19:43:18	@Espyo	and it's good to go

2015-11-10 19:57:22	ScruffyChat	If, no, when they mention Pikmin 4, are we gonna put any speculative stuff on Pikipedia?
2015-11-10 19:57:58	Klemen702	is speculative content allowed?
2015-11-10 19:58:23	Klemen702	to me it doesn't seem a good idea to put it on a site that is supposed to be about giving out information that has been confirmed

2015-11-10 20:07:11	UltraMario	also it seems like a neat puzzle game
2015-11-10 20:07:13	UltraMario	:>
2015-11-10 20:08:50	Klemen702	i love how louie bumps into obstacles

2015-11-10 20:13:06	UltraMario	you never beat plucking pikmin level 2
2015-11-10 20:13:07	UltraMario	:p
2015-11-10 20:13:38	UltraMario	also olimar does too
2015-11-10 20:14:31	evilmanimani	lol yeah I don't beat all the levels
2015-11-10 20:14:55	evilmanimani	no translation out there, as far as I've seen
2015-11-10 20:14:57	ScruffyChat	These are tough!
2015-11-10 20:14:59	UltraMario	or 3
2015-11-10 20:15:14	evilmanimani	yeah, they're definitely tough
2015-11-10 20:15:30	evilmanimani	and they have 50 levels per game type
2015-11-10 20:15:38	evilmanimani	so this is 9 out of 150 levels
2015-11-10 20:15:38	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-10 20:15:49	ScruffyChat	Do they all use the same music?
2015-11-10 20:15:56	evilmanimani	but you need all of the different Pikmin 2 e-reader cards
2015-11-10 20:16:06	UltraMario	oh
2015-11-10 20:16:07	UltraMario	wow

2015-11-10 20:16:25	UltraMario	there's 150 cards?
2015-11-10 20:16:26	UltraMario	:|
2015-11-10 20:16:35	evilmanimani	not sure how many cards there are
2015-11-10 20:16:41	evilmanimani	the cards unlock 1-3 stages
2015-11-10 20:16:58	Klemen702	how many do you own?
2015-11-10 20:17:00	evilmanimani	I have the Olimar, Louie and the President cards that came with the game in Japan
2015-11-10 20:17:11	evilmanimani	but that's it
2015-11-10 20:17:27	evilmanimani	cause packs of 5 are being sold from malaysia for like $15
2015-11-10 20:17:30	Testyo	$ 15 = 13.7955 € / £ 9.7485 
2015-11-10 20:17:45	evilmanimani	too expensive
2015-11-10 20:17:55	Klemen702	oh wow
2015-11-10 20:18:08	Klemen702	nvm
2015-11-10 20:18:27	Klemen702	just a personal thought i got in my mind

2015-11-10 20:19:02	evilmanimani	it's 30 each, not 50
2015-11-10 20:19:06	evilmanimani	so 9 out of 90
2015-11-10 20:38:37	Klemen702	it's time

2015-11-10 21:31:57	ScruffyChat	How's it going
2015-11-10 21:32:01	ScruffyChat	How's your project?
2015-11-10 21:32:26	@Espyo	hey
2015-11-10 21:32:34	@Espyo	yeah, I was asking that myself some time ago, too
2015-11-10 21:45:29	En_Passant	Not well
2015-11-10 21:45:38	En_Passant	I'm getting too disorganized in what I'm trying to do
2015-11-10 21:46:00	En_Passant	I was expecting Unreal to be a lot more natural for me to learn
2015-11-10 21:46:06	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-11-10 21:46:11	@Espyo	well, keep chugging forward
2015-11-10 21:48:07	En_Passant	I've purchased some books that will hopefully help guide me
2015-11-10 21:48:14	En_Passant	Better than swimming in tutorials
2015-11-10 21:48:24	En_Passant	I'm worried about running out of time
2015-11-10 21:48:47	En_Passant	It's prime college time right now, too
2015-11-10 21:48:56	En_Passant	Have one application due Friday and another on Monday
2015-11-10 21:51:14	ScruffyChat	Ooh, that's rough
2015-11-10 21:51:36	ScruffyChat	Hang in there though, it's worth it
2015-11-10 21:53:29	@Espyo	and I'm sure they're expecting you to fail and slip up on a lot of parts throughout
2015-11-10 21:53:36	@Espyo	it'll go into your grade, but not necessarily negatively
2015-11-10 21:54:02	@Espyo	they know you can't just grab a person with little to no experience and ask them to plan out a big project, expecting them to get most of the times right first try
2015-11-10 21:54:21	@Espyo	major companies still over or underestimate their project schedules, even with years of experience
2015-11-10 21:54:28	@Espyo	so don't let it get to your head
2015-11-10 21:55:23	En_Passant	Thankfully, we're not graded on keeping to schedules
2015-11-10 21:55:37	@Espyo	great
2015-11-10 21:55:57	En_Passant	We have to do journals every couple of weeks to track our progress, though
2015-11-10 21:56:06	En_Passant	They're worth 35% of the grade
2015-11-10 21:56:10	@Espyo	yeah, they likely want to see how quickly you learn new things, and adapt to...
2015-11-10 21:56:12	@Espyo	GAH, what's the word?
2015-11-10 21:56:17	@Espyo	it's on the tip of my tongue

2015-11-10 21:56:32	@Espyo	unforeseen... things
2015-11-10 21:56:32	@Espyo	there's a simple word for it

2015-11-10 21:56:46	ScruffyChat	fancy
2015-11-10 21:56:49	@Espyo	oh yeah, the journals, they were kinda big for my main projects too
2015-11-10 21:56:54	@Espyo	that's not the one
2015-11-10 21:57:29	@Espyo	I... guess there isn't
2015-11-10 21:57:30	@Espyo	what
2015-11-10 21:57:37	@Espyo	there is one in Portuguese
2015-11-10 21:57:49	@Espyo	literally means "unforeseen", but can be used as a noun
2015-11-10 21:57:54	@Espyo	"an unforeseen"
2015-11-10 21:57:58	@J	surprise?
2015-11-10 21:58:04	ScruffyChat	stumbling blocks?

2015-11-10 22:00:38	ScruffyChat	Typical of English to leave out a word for something important and instead have many words that mean the same thing
2015-11-10 22:01:01	@Espyo	I feel so defeated
2015-11-10 22:01:06	@Espyo	because it FEELS like there's a word for it
2015-11-10 22:01:07	@Espyo	a noun
2015-11-10 22:01:09	@Espyo	just like Portuguese

2015-11-10 22:01:12	@Espyo	and I'm just not finding it

2015-11-10 22:01:19	@Espyo	this is more important now

2015-11-10 22:01:25	@Espyo	we can't go on with your project until we finish this
2015-11-10 22:01:27	En_Passant	Try a translator?
2015-11-10 22:01:31	@Espyo	tried, nothing
2015-11-10 22:01:39	@Espyo	just adjectives

2015-11-10 22:02:16	En_Passant	It's not that uncommon
2015-11-10 22:02:26	En_Passant	Expect the unexpected is a famous phrase from a movie
2015-11-10 22:02:34	En_Passant	Don't know which one

2015-11-10 22:02:57	ScruffyChat	Wait no
2015-11-10 22:03:00	ScruffyChat	I made that up
2015-11-10 22:03:22	@Espyo	pronoun followed by adjective and implied noun?
2015-11-10 22:03:23	ScruffyChat	complications?
2015-11-10 22:03:29	@Espyo	not really the same as a simple noun
2015-11-10 22:03:51	En_Passant	Wait, never mind
2015-11-10 22:04:00	En_Passant	Expect the unexpected is from a Greek scholar
2015-11-10 22:04:11	En_Passant	But everyone knows of it
2015-11-10 22:04:55	ScruffyChat	Ah, Heraclites
2015-11-10 22:05:08	ScruffyChat	He also came up with "No man steps in the same river twice"
2015-11-10 22:06:25	ScruffyChat	Shoot, this is irritating

2015-11-10 22:16:03	@Espyo	gah it's so simple in Portuguese, because you literally just use the word "unforeseen" as a noun
2015-11-10 22:16:26	@Espyo	not that that's a thing you can do normally in Portuguese or anything, it's just that "unforeseen" is an adjective AND a noun

2015-11-10 22:18:47	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-11-10 22:18:50	En_Passant	But...
2015-11-10 22:18:51	ScruffyChat	I like how it's not 100%
2015-11-10 22:18:52	@Espyo	ugh, now I feel so sure
2015-11-10 22:18:58	En_Passant	Deviations are just distraction

2015-11-10 22:19:04	@PikFan	The ability to adapt to deviations.
2015-11-10 22:19:05	@Espyo	not necessarily
2015-11-10 22:19:06	En_Passant	They're not necessarily unforeseeable
2015-11-10 22:19:11	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-11-10 22:19:22	@Espyo	well, but between all the suggestions...
2015-11-10 22:19:25	@PikFan	words can have different meanings, so it works
2015-11-10 22:19:31	@PikFan	I think, anyway
2015-11-10 22:19:54	@PikFan	but we'd just need some context in order to really cement it
2015-11-10 22:19:56	@Espyo	we're going to be discussing philosophy soon if we don't zip it
2015-11-10 22:20:00	@Espyo	and as much as I'd love to...
2015-11-10 22:20:05	@Espyo	I really want to finish these Pikmin 3 maps
2015-11-10 22:20:12	@PikFan	so, how's Pikmin Forever going, Scruffy?
2015-11-10 22:20:37	ScruffyChat	Good, I just uploaded some more metal object render
2015-11-10 22:20:39	ScruffyChat	s*
2015-11-10 22:20:44	@PikFan	and sorry about last night, my mom ended up using the computer longer than I thought
2015-11-10 22:20:59	ScruffyChat	That's okay, I had to study calculus anyway
2015-11-10 22:21:08	@PikFan	calculus
2015-11-10 22:21:10	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-10 22:21:29	En_Passant	You said it was Calc II, right?
2015-11-10 22:21:29	@PikFan	isn't algebra involving math with motionless objects, and calculus with moving objects
2015-11-10 22:21:36	@PikFan	or am I totally confused
2015-11-10 22:22:05	ScruffyChat	Calculus is based on finding the slope of a function at a certain point
2015-11-10 22:22:11	ScruffyChat	Algebra is what you need to do that
2015-11-10 22:22:16	ScruffyChat	And it's calc 1

2015-11-10 22:23:31	ScruffyChat	And then you have specific courses on differential equations
2015-11-10 22:23:37	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-10 22:23:38	ScruffyChat	Calculus with multiple variables
2015-11-10 22:23:42	En_Passant	And then you have linear algebra
2015-11-10 22:23:46	ScruffyChat	Calculus in 4 dimensions

2015-11-10 22:23:57	En_Passant	... well, kind of
2015-11-10 22:24:05	ScruffyChat	yeah, it's just w,x,y,z
2015-11-10 22:24:08	En_Passant	Linear Algebra doesn't actually involve calculus
2015-11-10 22:24:16	En_Passant	It's about matrices and vector spaces
2015-11-10 22:24:45	En_Passant	And it builds theories that work in however many dimensions you please
2015-11-10 22:24:57	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-10 22:25:18	@PikFan	okay, can somebody explain the insolubility of the quintic to me
2015-11-10 22:25:35	En_Passant	not me

2015-11-10 22:29:10	@PikFan	they really want to keep speculation to a minimum
2015-11-10 22:29:30	@PikFan	I can understand NX, but why not mobile?
2015-11-10 22:29:43	@PikFan	Nintendo's lack of revealing long-term projects is disturbing

2015-11-10 22:46:10	ScruffyChat	Hey, that's catchy
2015-11-10 22:46:15	ScruffyChat	You should write a song
2015-11-10 22:46:23	@Espyo	hehe
2015-11-10 22:46:27	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-10 22:46:33	@PikFan	maybe
2015-11-10 22:46:42	@PikFan	I'm only good at writing prose, though
2015-11-10 22:46:43	@Espyo	although we should invest in creating a P4 article REALLY soon
2015-11-10 22:46:49	@Espyo	hopefully thursday if we get enough info
2015-11-10 22:46:53	@Espyo	thing is, wikia has an article
2015-11-10 22:46:57	@Espyo	of course, HORRIBLY EMPTY
2015-11-10 22:46:59	@Espyo	and speculative
2015-11-10 22:47:00	@Espyo	BUT
2015-11-10 22:47:06	@Espyo	it appears at the top of search results...
2015-11-10 22:47:11	ScruffyChat	hmm
2015-11-10 22:47:19	@Espyo	our section on the Pikmin series article... almost doesn't appear at all
2015-11-10 22:47:49	ScruffyChat	Perhaps we should start the article as an analysis of anything that is heard or shown in the vide
2015-11-10 22:47:51	ScruffyChat	video(
2015-11-10 22:48:08	En_Passant	Like, make it a giant TO BE CONTINUED
2015-11-10 22:48:23	@PikFan	you mean like Fanon, basically
2015-11-10 22:48:38	@PikFan	or any incomplete project
2015-11-10 22:48:41	ScruffyChat	I could make a fake screenshot and that would bring up our search
2015-11-10 22:48:51	@PikFan	oh dear
2015-11-10 22:49:00	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-11-10 22:49:13	@PikFan	Espyo, last night me and Scruffy were talking about adding hazard icons to Fanon
2015-11-10 22:49:21	ScruffyChat	I was already thinking of making fake gameplay footage of Pikmin Forever
2015-11-10 22:49:42	En_Passant	I wouldn't do that yet, PikFan
2015-11-10 22:49:46	@Espyo	yeah, an analysis article, for sure
2015-11-10 22:49:53	En_Passant	Fanon has much more pressing issues than hazard icons
2015-11-10 22:49:54	@Espyo	PikFan: uh-hu?
2015-11-10 22:50:08	@PikFan	well, sure, but we didn't mean right away
2015-11-10 22:50:39	En_Passant	We should probably port over the icons from Canon
2015-11-10 22:50:43	@PikFan	but yeah, Scruffy offered to make them, and we were wondering—right
2015-11-10 22:50:46	En_Passant	We could it then
2015-11-10 22:51:05	En_Passant	And I mean ALL of the icons
2015-11-10 22:51:08	@PikFan	so the fanon hazard icons would just follow the P2 style, then
2015-11-10 22:51:32	@PikFan	as for obstacle icons...
2015-11-10 22:51:52	@PikFan	I'm not so sure we should do that, as there's probably more obstacles than hazards
2015-11-10 22:54:13	@PikFan	okay, just looked over the procedures, they seem pretty solid
2015-11-10 22:54:30	@PikFan	this time I'll actually add information instead of just adding random tidbits

2015-11-10 22:56:01	En_Passant	I'll probably have to choose between Pikmin 3 and 4 if it's for the Wii U
2015-11-10 22:56:07	En_Passant	Which one should I get?
2015-11-10 22:56:19	@Espyo	Pikmin 4 is a lot better than 3
2015-11-10 22:56:23	@Espyo	oh wait, I don't know that yet |:
2015-11-10 22:56:34	@PikFan	we can always hope
2015-11-10 22:57:01	ScruffyChat	I'd assume they'd learn some stuff since P3
2015-11-10 22:57:17	@PikFan	okay, so I don't understand why people think that the NX would launch in Q4 2016
2015-11-10 22:57:37	@PikFan	consoles usually launch the year after they're revealed
2015-11-10 22:57:59	ScruffyChat	Hasn't it been revealed though?
2015-11-10 22:58:08	ScruffyChat	Or at least they've confirmed it
2015-11-10 22:58:08	@PikFan	not a major reveal, I mean
2015-11-10 22:58:13	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-10 22:58:16	@Espyo	why the hell are the Twilight River textures squashed on the radar
2015-11-10 22:58:19	@Espyo	why can't they be real-size?
2015-11-10 22:58:26	@Espyo	why make life harder on everybody?
2015-11-10 22:58:32	@PikFan	because Pikmin
2015-11-10 22:58:39	En_Passant	Pretty much
2015-11-10 22:58:43	@Espyo	...yeah
2015-11-10 22:58:44	@Espyo	pretty much
2015-11-10 22:58:45	En_Passant	We're talking the same team behind Pikmin 2
2015-11-10 22:58:52	@PikFan	well, actually
2015-11-10 22:59:02	ScruffyChat	Maybe they specifically made it complicated so no one would look through it
2015-11-10 22:59:10	ScruffyChat	Defensive programming
2015-11-10 22:59:10	@PikFan	because Nintendo's devs are just money greedy jerks wearing trollfaces laughing at the hackers
2015-11-10 22:59:41	@PikFan	also
2015-11-10 22:59:50	@PikFan	I'm excited that there's no school tomorrow
2015-11-10 22:59:55	@PikFan	thank you Veterans Day
2015-11-10 22:59:58	ScruffyChat	Lucky
2015-11-10 23:00:02	ScruffyChat	I have two tests
2015-11-10 23:00:05	@PikFan	D:
2015-11-10 23:00:12	ScruffyChat	It's no big deal
2015-11-10 23:00:21	@PikFan	I just had a test today on genetics
2015-11-10 23:00:23	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-10 23:00:25	@PikFan	worst
2015-11-10 23:00:26	@PikFan	test
2015-11-10 23:00:27	@PikFan	ever
2015-11-10 23:00:30	ScruffyChat	Mendelian squares?
2015-11-10 23:00:32	@PikFan	...so far
2015-11-10 23:00:34	En_Passant	A-T, G-C
2015-11-10 23:00:48	@PikFan	oh, no, we're not THAT far, yet
2015-11-10 23:00:57	@Espyo	why WHY
2015-11-10 23:01:06	@PikFan	but I mean, compared to everything else, genetics is just so... abstract
2015-11-10 23:01:07	@Espyo	why does the Twilight River have five radar textures
2015-11-10 23:01:13	@Espyo	and one of them is just a bit of ground
2015-11-10 23:01:15	@Espyo	like 10x10 pixels
2015-11-10 23:01:18	@Espyo	WHERE DOES THAT GO
2015-11-10 23:01:24	@PikFan	have fun, Espyo
2015-11-10 23:01:28	@Espyo	nuts to that
2015-11-10 23:01:32	@Espyo	that's staying in the cutting room floor
2015-11-10 23:02:33	ScruffyChat	brb, maybe 10 minutes
2015-11-10 23:03:07	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-10 23:03:26	@Espyo	on the flip side, the finished TR map actually looks pretty good
2015-11-10 23:03:32	@Espyo	the two pipes are actually connected
2015-11-10 23:03:33	@Espyo	by a black pipe
2015-11-10 23:06:14	@PikFan	weird
2015-11-10 23:08:15	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: to answer your question last night about the fanfics
2015-11-10 23:08:29	@PikFan	the only one I've worked on lately is Mysterious World
2015-11-10 23:08:56	@PikFan	I revised parts of Chapter 5 then extended the battle a bit
2015-11-10 23:09:02	@PikFan	it's still not finished
2015-11-10 23:09:17	@PikFan	ultimately, I'm thinking that the Winged Pikmin will come in and save them
2015-11-10 23:09:45	@PikFan	it's a bit cliché, yes
2015-11-10 23:10:00	@PikFan	but I think it'd be a nice way to introduce the Winged Pikmin
2015-11-10 23:10:44	@PikFan	it'd also solve the problem of them getting stuck at the top of the tree, since the tunnel behind them collapses
2015-11-10 23:12:02	ScruffyChat	back
2015-11-10 23:12:32	ScruffyChat	I see
2015-11-10 23:12:59	ScruffyChat	How would the Winged Pikmin act?
2015-11-10 23:13:05	@PikFan	energetic
2015-11-10 23:13:17	@PikFan	very lively
2015-11-10 23:13:39	ScruffyChat	I can certainly imagine that
2015-11-10 23:13:46	ScruffyChat	What about the other types?

2015-11-10 23:14:03	@PikFan	Yellow Pikmin tend to be quiet and prefer peace
2015-11-10 23:14:04	ScruffyChat	The question just came to mind
2015-11-10 23:14:28	@PikFan	because they like high places, so it's kinda like meditation, almost
2015-11-10 23:14:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 23:14:36	@PikFan	Blue Pikmin... I'm not so sure
2015-11-10 23:14:59	@PikFan	Whites are also going to be very energetic
2015-11-10 23:15:11	ScruffyChat	I feel like other Pikmin types should find the Blue Pikmin odd
2015-11-10 23:15:16	@PikFan	I might have it so that Whites and Wingeds get into disagreements
2015-11-10 23:15:36	@PikFan	squeaky voices arguing with squeaky voices
2015-11-10 23:15:41	@PikFan	it'd be funny
2015-11-10 23:15:51	ScruffyChat	heh
2015-11-10 23:16:15	@PikFan	Purples would also be a quieter type
2015-11-10 23:16:22	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-10 23:16:30	@PikFan	perhaps the Blues would act like the mediators?
2015-11-10 23:16:43	@PikFan	they like to find harmony and balance
2015-11-10 23:16:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 23:16:56	@PikFan	I dunno, just tossing ideas
2015-11-10 23:17:16	@PikFan	and then Rocks
2015-11-10 23:17:23	@PikFan	I totally forgot about Rocks
2015-11-10 23:17:34	ScruffyChat	Maybe they don't act humanized
2015-11-10 23:17:41	@PikFan	sure, maybe
2015-11-10 23:17:58	ScruffyChat	Well, that wouldn't really make sense
2015-11-10 23:18:08	ScruffyChat	If Pikmin have had time to evolve like this
2015-11-10 23:18:24	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-10 23:18:30	@PikFan	maybe they could also act like warriors
2015-11-10 23:18:47	@PikFan	especially since they've got that natural defense against crushing

2015-11-10 23:19:28	@PikFan	but that would be redundant, since Red and Purples are already warrior types
2015-11-10 23:19:29	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-10 23:19:59	@PikFan	well, maybe they're like an in-between of Reds and Purples
2015-11-10 23:20:35	@PikFan	Purples being silent and mysterious; Reds being loud and boisterous
2015-11-10 23:20:59	ScruffyChat	In that case don't make Purples warriors
2015-11-10 23:21:14	ScruffyChat	Make them thinkers
2015-11-10 23:21:21	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-10 23:21:26	@PikFan	oh yeah!
2015-11-10 23:21:29	@PikFan	that works
2015-11-10 23:21:29	ScruffyChat	Philosophers
2015-11-10 23:21:35	ScruffyChat	despite their appearance
2015-11-10 23:21:40	@PikFan	in another story I read, the Purples were scientists
2015-11-10 23:21:55	@PikFan	they were living in the Subterranean Complex and they had tamed the Man at Legs
2015-11-10 23:22:04	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-11-10 23:22:21	ScruffyChat	That's where I always went to farm enough Purples for the Doomsday Apparaturs
2015-11-10 23:22:30	@PikFan	same
2015-11-10 23:22:41	@PikFan	I think just about everybody goes there, heh
2015-11-10 23:22:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 23:23:21	En_Passant	What story is that?
2015-11-10 23:23:47	@PikFan	okay, so Reds and Rocks are warriors, Yellows are solitary/quiet, Purples are thinkers/scientists, Blues are harmonious/mediators, Whites and Wingeds are childlike/energetic
2015-11-10 23:23:55	@PikFan	it's got a weird name
2015-11-10 23:24:15	@PikFan	like Nanovolt Entry of Existence, or something
2015-11-10 23:24:18	@PikFan	I'm not too sure

2015-11-10 23:24:53	@PikFan	also, Reds are more competitive than Rocks, so there's that

2015-11-10 23:25:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-10 23:25:30	@PikFan	so, what do you think?
2015-11-10 23:25:31	ScruffyChat	Maybe Rocks are more cowardly
2015-11-10 23:25:45	ScruffyChat	or, not cowardly
2015-11-10 23:25:49	ScruffyChat	just, easily afraid
2015-11-10 23:25:55	ScruffyChat	you can hear it in their voices
2015-11-10 23:26:03	@PikFan	I was thinking that they're more respectful
2015-11-10 23:26:20	@PikFan	but hmm
2015-11-10 23:26:28	@PikFan	I'll think about it some

2015-11-10 23:30:54	@Espyo	the textures are just big chunks, though
2015-11-10 23:30:56	@Espyo	so it has a lot of unused space
2015-11-10 23:31:01	ScruffyChat	Yeah

2015-11-10 23:40:22	ScruffyChat	Are they all just trees? Or maybe something else like in the Valley of Repose
2015-11-10 23:41:07	En_Passant	I thought the skybox was rendered

2015-11-11 00:00:50	@Espyo	even though he's been here for 6+ minutes
2015-11-11 00:00:58	@Espyo	anyway... yeah, got the textures
2015-11-11 00:01:03	@PikFan	I meant when I was gone...
2015-11-11 00:01:06	@Espyo	don't remember seeing them before, but they're here
2015-11-11 00:01:10	@PikFan	for 30 minutes or so
2015-11-11 00:01:13	@Espyo	let's see, for the Tropical Wilds
2015-11-11 00:01:19	@Espyo	there's leaves
2015-11-11 00:01:24	@Espyo	like P1 or P2
2015-11-11 00:01:37	@Espyo	more leave
2015-11-11 00:01:38	@Espyo	*s
2015-11-11 00:01:41	@Espyo	...disco leaves
2015-11-11 00:01:49	@Espyo	more leaves, and more leaves
2015-11-11 00:01:57	ScruffyChat	That's what I thought
2015-11-11 00:02:03	@Espyo	this one texture is tree leaves as usual, but techno-colored
2015-11-11 00:02:09	ScruffyChat	Huh
2015-11-11 00:02:11	@Espyo	background is red, leaves are green
2015-11-11 00:02:14	@Espyo	there are blue dots going about
2015-11-11 00:02:15	ScruffyChat	Interesting
2015-11-11 00:02:16	@Espyo	what
2015-11-11 00:02:28	@Espyo	I'll just show you guys real quick before I leave
2015-11-11 00:02:34	ScruffyChat	before you leaf
2015-11-11 00:02:42	@Espyo	heeeeyyy
2015-11-11 00:02:56	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/room_02_proj_shadow.gtx.png
2015-11-11 00:03:26	ScruffyChat	I've got nothing
2015-11-11 00:03:33	ScruffyChat	This is listed under shadows?
2015-11-11 00:03:41	ScruffyChat	or, listed as a shadow
2015-11-11 00:04:17	ScruffyChat	Maybe that's for the boss arena
2015-11-11 00:04:23	@Espyo	it has the same name as the other shadows
2015-11-11 00:04:24	ScruffyChat	Wait no
2015-11-11 00:04:27	ScruffyChat	Never mind
2015-11-11 00:04:34	@Espyo	oh wait, it's called "room_<number>_proj_shadow"
2015-11-11 00:04:55	@Espyo	a "room" for Pikmin 3 is one of the sub-areas that cause a Looney Tunes fade-in-fade-out transition when you go from one to another
2015-11-11 00:05:06	@Espyo	room 02 of the Tropical Wilds is...
2015-11-11 00:05:31	@Espyo	Sandbelching Meerslug's arena
2015-11-11 00:05:32	@Espyo	hm
2015-11-11 00:05:35	@PikFan	wow, they really are disco leaves
2015-11-11 00:05:36	@PikFan	awesome
2015-11-11 00:05:52	@PikFan	disco area for P4 confirmed
2015-11-11 00:06:03	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-11 00:06:28	@Espyo	well, night
2015-11-11 00:06:31	@PikFan	night
2015-11-11 00:06:32	ScruffyChat	night
2015-11-11 00:06:36	<--	Espyo (Espyo@n62-481-0-415.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-11-11 00:07:04	<--	Testyo (Testyo@n62-481-0-415.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-11-11 00:07:05	ScruffyChat	huh, the shadows are there all right
2015-11-11 00:07:10	ScruffyChat	in the arena
2015-11-11 00:07:19	ScruffyChat	But there aren't any trees there
2015-11-11 00:07:24	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-11 00:07:49	ScruffyChat	Besides the palm trees
2015-11-11 00:10:07	@PikFan	right
2015-11-11 00:10:09	@PikFan	oh, speaking of
2015-11-11 00:10:27	@PikFan	I had mentioned that I wanted shadows of palm trees cast on the scene, too
2015-11-11 00:10:35	@PikFan	let me check the scene again
2015-11-11 00:11:13	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-11 00:11:29	@PikFan	eh, even if there were shadows, the water would make them hard to see
2015-11-11 00:12:34	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-11 00:12:50	ScruffyChat	I can make it more noticeable though
2015-11-11 00:12:58	ScruffyChat	I could make the water less transparent
2015-11-11 00:13:03	ScruffyChat	more*
2015-11-11 00:13:36	@PikFan	I didn't even realize it was transparent until now lol
2015-11-11 00:14:10	ScruffyChat	Just barely
2015-11-11 00:14:16	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-11 00:22:10	ScruffyChat	Hey, I have to go in about 10 minutes,
2015-11-11 00:22:30	ScruffyChat	I was wondering if you could give me feedback on the first chapter of Louie's story so far
2015-11-11 00:22:35	ScruffyChat	If you wanted to
2015-11-11 00:22:42	@PikFan	oh, sure, I'd love to!
2015-11-11 00:22:55	ScruffyChat	Great, I'll post it
2015-11-11 00:23:51	ScruffyChat	http://pastebin.com/XqY5MQgQ
2015-11-11 00:25:09	@PikFan	>You know what, Chapter 1: Hocotate.
2015-11-11 00:25:14	@PikFan	I don't get that
2015-11-11 00:25:54	ScruffyChat	Oh, shoot, I forgot to delete that
2015-11-11 00:26:14	ScruffyChat	At first I had him decide to begin Chapter 1 there, but then I changed it
2015-11-11 00:26:20	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-11 00:26:25	@PikFan	what's it meant to be?
2015-11-11 00:26:46	@PikFan	"You know what, Hocotate, I’m sorry, but what a sorry excuse for a home."
2015-11-11 00:26:48	@PikFan	that?
2015-11-11 00:27:03	ScruffyChat	No just "Hocotate. I'm sorry, but..."
2015-11-11 00:27:17	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-11 00:27:30	@PikFan	having that sorry in there twice sounds awkward
2015-11-11 00:27:41	ScruffyChat	Oh, you're right
2015-11-11 00:27:44	@PikFan	what a sad excuse?
2015-11-11 00:27:50	@PikFan	that sounds better
2015-11-11 00:27:52	ScruffyChat	perfect
2015-11-11 00:30:10	@PikFan	I like it
2015-11-11 00:30:15	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-11-11 00:30:32	@PikFan	I love the backstory behind Hocotate Freight
2015-11-11 00:30:42	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-11-11 00:30:58	ScruffyChat	Any suggestions?
2015-11-11 00:31:19	@PikFan	well, while I did like the backstory, there's not much about just Louie
2015-11-11 00:31:32	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-11 00:31:34	@PikFan	I mean, this IS his story, right?
2015-11-11 00:31:40	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-11-11 00:31:42	ScruffyChat	LIke
2015-11-11 00:31:43	@PikFan	so he should be in the spotlight
2015-11-11 00:31:47	ScruffyChat	This is the very beginning
2015-11-11 00:31:54	@PikFan	true
2015-11-11 00:31:55	ScruffyChat	I was going to get into his dad
2015-11-11 00:32:02	ScruffyChat	And then his grandmother
2015-11-11 00:32:15	ScruffyChat	And that would set up his childhood story
2015-11-11 00:32:20	<--	En_Passant (Mibbit@54-098-06-454.hlrn.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-11-11 00:32:23	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-11 00:32:27	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-11 00:32:40	@PikFan	though that doesn't seem very... fluid, I suppose
2015-11-11 00:32:45	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-11-11 00:32:49	<--	evilmanimani (Mibbit@67.164.yq.gx) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-11-11 00:32:53	@PikFan	I dunno
2015-11-11 00:33:12	@PikFan	I'll just wait and see what you come up with, then I'll offer opinions
2015-11-11 00:33:38	ScruffyChat	Hmm yeah, maybe I should introduce Louie's childhood first, and then he describes his parents, and that includes the backstory to Hocotate Freight
2015-11-11 00:33:55	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-11 00:34:17	ScruffyChat	And eventually since his dad is so fond of Hocotate Freight he has Louie sign up
2015-11-11 00:34:18	@PikFan	that aside, I like the tone of it
2015-11-11 00:34:23	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-11-11 00:34:38	@PikFan	you can really feel his hate
2015-11-11 00:34:44	ScruffyChat	I always felt Louie to be the cynical type
2015-11-11 00:35:07	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-11 00:35:09	ScruffyChat	Albeit, I couldn't say any of this is a projection of my own thoughts
2015-11-11 00:35:16	ScruffyChat	This is an entirely fictional character
2015-11-11 00:35:33	@PikFan	in that case, Olimar is also an exception
2015-11-11 00:35:37	@PikFan	he seems to be humble
2015-11-11 00:35:55	@PikFan	I mean, I feel like he's humble
2015-11-11 00:36:29	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-11 00:36:41	@PikFan	okay, well, maybe not humble, but he isn't greedy, either
2015-11-11 00:36:41	ScruffyChat	I'm thinking Louie will be cool with Olimar
2015-11-11 00:36:54	ScruffyChat	But not with the President
2015-11-11 00:37:03	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-11 00:37:29	ScruffyChat	But by the events of Pikmin 3 their friendship starts to fade
2015-11-11 00:37:42	@PikFan	Olimar and Louie's?
2015-11-11 00:37:45	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-11 00:37:49	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-11 00:37:57	ScruffyChat	You can tell in the data files they both don't want to be there
2015-11-11 00:38:04	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-11 00:38:07	ScruffyChat	Although Louie learns not to mind being there alone
2015-11-11 00:38:27	@PikFan	maybe food is like his comfort zone, so that's why he's always asking for food
2015-11-11 00:38:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-11 00:38:32	@PikFan	not maybe
2015-11-11 00:38:33	@PikFan	it is
2015-11-11 00:38:49	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, he's going to be /really/ into food
2015-11-11 00:38:57	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-11 00:39:06	ScruffyChat	And consider PNF-404 to be a gift from the flavor gods
2015-11-11 00:39:12	@PikFan	of course
2015-11-11 00:39:34	@PikFan	in Pikmin 2, there's an email that says that his grandma made him eat bugs as a kid
2015-11-11 00:39:39	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-11-11 00:39:47	ScruffyChat	Those letters are all I have for his childhood
2015-11-11 00:39:55	ScruffyChat	There's a yard behind their house
2015-11-11 00:39:59	ScruffyChat	But Louie never played outside
2015-11-11 00:40:01	@PikFan	other than that, we don't know why he's into cooking and eating so much, so I hope you can explain that
2015-11-11 00:40:17	@PikFan	oh, I think that was mentioned in the same email as the bug eating part
2015-11-11 00:40:21	ScruffyChat	So his grandma made him eat the plants and bugs to get the experience of being outside
2015-11-11 00:40:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-11 00:40:47	ScruffyChat	And that showed him that, while the outside isn't most friendly, it's tasty
2015-11-11 00:40:54	ScruffyChat	And he develops a fondness for bugs
2015-11-11 00:41:05	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-11 00:41:07	ScruffyChat	He'll have some creatures that he's named and will never kill
2015-11-11 00:41:12	@PikFan	wait, question
2015-11-11 00:41:19	@PikFan	when does this happen?
2015-11-11 00:41:22	@PikFan	the story, I mean
2015-11-11 00:41:53	ScruffyChat	After he is left on the planet the second time
2015-11-11 00:42:03	ScruffyChat	And has no hope of repairing the Hocotate ship
2015-11-11 00:42:07	@PikFan	oh, after P3
2015-11-11 00:42:09	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-11 00:42:27	ScruffyChat	yeah, he'll be recording this in one of the space logs left on the Hocotate ship
2015-11-11 00:42:48	ScruffyChat	From Olimar's notes on treasures in P2, it's obvious those are audio logs, not written
2015-11-11 00:42:50	@PikFan	and then maybe his animosity reaches Olimar, too, since he was left behind /again/
2015-11-11 00:43:00	@PikFan	hmm, how?
2015-11-11 00:43:10	@PikFan	I never paid attention
2015-11-11 00:43:27	ScruffyChat	There's one article for example, I think it's for the Activity Arouse
2015-11-11 00:43:30	ScruffyChat	Arouser*
2015-11-11 00:43:34	ScruffyChat	Where he tries dancing
2015-11-11 00:43:45	ScruffyChat	And he says hey this isn't so bad
2015-11-11 00:43:59	ScruffyChat	And it sort of falters into "One, two, cha cha cha...
2015-11-11 00:44:11	ScruffyChat	I just thought, that must be recorded
2015-11-11 00:44:20	ScruffyChat	he wouldn't write that
2015-11-11 00:44:23	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-11 00:44:51	ScruffyChat	So Louie takes the remaining logs and tells his story
2015-11-11 00:45:00	@PikFan	right
2015-11-11 00:45:09	ScruffyChat	Hoping some day someone will find them
2015-11-11 00:45:10	@PikFan	I feel bad for Louie
2015-11-11 00:45:14	ScruffyChat	Me too
2015-11-11 00:45:16	@PikFan	secretly hoping
2015-11-11 00:45:30	ScruffyChat	Hoping for what?
2015-11-11 00:45:41	@PikFan	16:45	ScruffyChat	Hoping some day someone will find them
2015-11-11 00:45:48	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-11 00:45:50	@PikFan	he secretly hopes for that to happen
2015-11-11 00:45:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-11 00:46:09	ScruffyChat	I also feel like he's doing this so he can run back through his story
2015-11-11 00:46:21	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-11 00:46:24	ScruffyChat	Because he's unsure whether what's happened to him is his fault
2015-11-11 00:46:38	ScruffyChat	He did eat the golden pikpik carrots
2015-11-11 00:46:46	ScruffyChat	but it's also a huge matter of circumstance
2015-11-11 00:46:52	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-11 00:47:17	@PikFan	nobody had any idea that there was a giant bug (the Titan Dweevil) living underground
2015-11-11 00:47:21	<--	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.lo.zpv) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-11-11 00:47:30	-->	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.lo.zpv) has joined #pikipedia
2015-11-11 00:47:33	ScruffyChat	Sorry what was that?
2015-11-11 00:47:34	@PikFan	16:47	PikFan	nobody had any idea that there was a giant bug (the Titan Dweevil) living underground
2015-11-11 00:47:41	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-11-11 00:47:49	ScruffyChat	I still don't know what to do about that
2015-11-11 00:47:57	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-11 00:47:58	ScruffyChat	Louie is still okay with Olimar at that point
2015-11-11 00:48:13	ScruffyChat	I feel like the first time he's left there should be a misunderstanding
2015-11-11 00:48:16	@PikFan	well, say that the TD is sentient somehow
2015-11-11 00:48:16	ScruffyChat	Or something
2015-11-11 00:48:25	ScruffyChat	What? Woah
2015-11-11 00:48:30	@PikFan	and it somehow taps into his inner rage
2015-11-11 00:48:35	ScruffyChat	true
2015-11-11 00:48:37	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-11-11 00:48:37	@PikFan	that rage possesses Louie
2015-11-11 00:48:42	ScruffyChat	Oh man
2015-11-11 00:48:52	ScruffyChat	Maybe a little bit of Titan Dweevil lives on in him!
2015-11-11 00:48:55	@PikFan	but subconsciously, Louie doesn't want to attack
2015-11-11 00:48:58	@PikFan	oooooooh
2015-11-11 00:49:10	@PikFan	now THAT'S an interesting idea
2015-11-11 00:49:23	ScruffyChat	And only while he's retelling it does he realize it
2015-11-11 00:49:57	@PikFan	we could say that Louie fainted from the shock of being cutoff from the TD, since its influence over him was so great
2015-11-11 00:50:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-11 00:50:38	ScruffyChat	Not only does the TD mimic treasure, it takes control of treasure
2015-11-11 00:50:49	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-11 00:50:56	ScruffyChat	Anyway I have to go
2015-11-11 00:51:02	@PikFan	hm, alright
2015-11-11 00:51:02	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna have some fun with that idea
2015-11-11 00:51:07	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-11 00:51:08	@PikFan	it is fun
2015-11-11 00:51:14	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-11-11 00:51:18	@PikFan	I might be on tomorrow, don't know when though

2015-11-11 20:01:24	@Espyo	hehe
2015-11-11 20:01:29	@Espyo	it's a phase
2015-11-11 20:01:32	@Espyo	youtube will get over it
2015-11-11 20:03:43	CreativeSushi	So Pikcast 11 is constantly processing 
2015-11-11 20:03:51	@Espyo	oh nice
2015-11-11 20:03:54	CreativeSushi	once it finishes it starts back at 0
2015-11-11 20:04:06	CreativeSushi	and goes to 95%
2015-11-11 20:04:06	@Espyo	uhm
2015-11-11 20:04:10	CreativeSushi	then starts over
2015-11-11 20:04:12	@Espyo	what
2015-11-11 20:04:22	CreativeSushi	Its a youtube bug
2015-11-11 20:04:43	CreativeSushi	concidering if I should wait, or just delete it and reupload
2015-11-11 20:04:46	CreativeSushi	which is going to be a pain
2015-11-11 20:05:01	CreativeSushi	because I've posted it on the forums, reddit, and twitter already
2015-11-11 20:05:12	CreativeSushi	The video is completely viewable
2015-11-11 20:05:19	@Espyo	ignore youtube
2015-11-11 20:05:19	CreativeSushi	its just not showing up in subscription feed
2015-11-11 20:05:22	CreativeSushi	or in list of video
2015-11-11 20:05:26	@Espyo	let it do its rain dance
2015-11-11 20:05:29	@Espyo	if the video is done, screw it
2015-11-11 20:05:30	@Espyo	all that matters
2015-11-11 20:05:44	@Espyo	I mean, if the video is visible, that's what matters
2015-11-11 20:06:09	CreativeSushi	the only way you can see it is if its linked to you
2015-11-11 20:06:17	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-11-11 20:06:39	@Espyo	well, you can't edit the reddit or twitter posts
2015-11-11 20:06:48	CreativeSushi	nope
2015-11-11 20:06:54	CreativeSushi	gotta delete and resubmit 
2015-11-11 20:07:07	@Espyo	might as well wait
2015-11-11 20:07:20	CreativeSushi	Alright
2015-11-11 20:07:23	@Espyo	deleting will invalidate those two posts
2015-11-11 20:07:30	CreativeSushi	youtube said that if its still processing after 8 hours to reupload
2015-11-11 20:07:35	CreativeSushi	so I'll wait till about then
2015-11-11 20:07:59	CreativeSushi	Oh Espyo, the forums are open to the public now
2015-11-11 20:08:04	@Espyo	if it's just taking a while, but WILL eventually upload fine
2015-11-11 20:08:06	@Espyo	then the worse that can happen is subscribers seeing the notification later
2015-11-11 20:08:11	@Espyo	ah, nice
2015-11-11 20:08:14	CreativeSushi	You've made an account right?
2015-11-11 20:08:17	@Espyo	any twitter/reddit posts about it?
2015-11-11 20:08:21	@Espyo	yeah, made when it was private
2015-11-11 20:08:28	CreativeSushi	I did make a twitter and reddit post
2015-11-11 20:08:35	CreativeSushi	Could you post here: http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/board/17/introduce
2015-11-11 20:08:47	CreativeSushi	Trying to get all the admins to do it to encourage the users to

2015-11-11 20:09:41	@Espyo	wow my internet is virtually stopped right now
2015-11-11 20:09:47	CreativeSushi	hmm
2015-11-11 20:10:48	@Espyo	the favicon is still the stock one
2015-11-11 20:11:35	@Espyo	hm, the contrast between the background of a post's link and the color of the link's text is horrible
2015-11-11 20:11:37	@Espyo	it's green on green
2015-11-11 20:11:49	@Espyo	the icons could still use some revamping
2015-11-11 20:11:53	@Espyo	the Sticky icon is a bit aliased
2015-11-11 20:13:00	CreativeSushi	I know
2015-11-11 20:13:08	CreativeSushi	Jordan is pretty persistent that they are good
2015-11-11 20:13:13	CreativeSushi	but I want to change them

2015-11-11 21:22:04	ScruffyChat	...if you could send me the model and textures for a Scornet
2015-11-11 21:22:07	ScruffyChat	Just the little one
2015-11-11 21:22:25	ScruffyChat	I wanted to try something in Blender
2015-11-11 21:22:38	@Espyo	all right
2015-11-11 21:22:44	ScruffyChat	Thank you!

2015-11-11 21:24:03	ScruffyChat	One had textures, the other had a working model
2015-11-11 21:24:42	@Espyo	the textures are their own thing
2015-11-11 21:24:46	@Espyo	so I can just send the 3DS and the textures
2015-11-11 21:24:50	@Espyo	it was the 3DS model that worked, right?
2015-11-11 21:25:33	ScruffyChat	Yes

2015-11-12 22:22:38	@PikFan	because they didn't explicitly say
2015-11-12 22:22:45	@PikFan	they just said "..."
2015-11-12 22:22:56	@PikFan	and that could mean anything
2015-11-12 22:23:00	@PikFan	so because you don't know
2015-11-12 22:23:02	@PikFan	you're not upset
2015-11-12 22:23:18	@Espyo	they said silence
2015-11-12 22:23:24	@Espyo	actually, they said NULL
2015-11-12 22:23:31	En_Passant	lol
2015-11-12 22:23:35	En_Passant	programming jokes are the best
2015-11-12 22:24:15	@PikFan	so, was there even anything that said Pikmin 4?
2015-11-12 22:24:20	@PikFan	like a logo, or anything?
2015-11-12 22:24:26	@Espyo	more like
2015-11-12 22:24:28	@Espyo	absolutely nothing
2015-11-12 22:24:42	@PikFan	then how do you know the ... was aimed at P4
2015-11-12 22:25:06	@Espyo	... = silence
2015-11-12 22:25:08	@Espyo	nothingness
2015-11-12 22:25:21	En_Passant	So that's what Blaziken's Brave Bird looks like
2015-11-12 22:25:23	@PikFan	then how do you know the silence was for P4
2015-11-12 22:25:59	@PikFan	I may have to leave very soon
2015-11-12 22:26:00	@Espyo	it could be said the silence was for everything
2015-11-12 22:26:01	@PikFan	right now, actually

2015-11-12 22:34:29	En_Passant	bleh, the new Fire Emblem is cash cow-ing so hard
2015-11-12 22:34:42	En_Passant	Sonic Adventure 2 gave you the same thing in one package
2015-11-12 22:37:52	En_Passant	uh oh, porting Gen 1 Pokemon exactly as they were
2015-11-12 22:38:05	En_Passant	Some of those glitch Pokemon permanently fucked up your system

2015-11-12 22:40:00	En_Passant	That's a problem
2015-11-12 22:40:10	En_Passant	I figure at least one of us would have found Pikmni by now

2015-11-13 19:55:38	Yoshi2	considering that pikmin 4 was never officially announced
2015-11-13 19:56:08	Yoshi2	probably a bit of disappointment that it wasn't announced this direct

2015-11-13 20:16:18	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-13 20:34:04	@Espyo	wait, we had code on the wikia to redirect the users to Pikipedia?

2015-11-13 20:34:24	@Espyo	because this twat (that can't even write proper English) removed it

2015-11-14 19:32:48	Yoyo	Candypop buds were in the first game and we didn't see them until the last area.
2015-11-14 19:33:55	Klemen702	wrong
2015-11-14 19:34:06	Klemen702	there is a puzzle requiring them in the distant spring

2015-11-15 00:34:08	@PikFan	Master, I calculate a near-improbable chance of that occurring.
2015-11-15 00:36:10	Scruffy	PikFan, thank you for reminding me about render layers
2015-11-15 00:36:20	Scruffy	It's speeding things up a lot
2015-11-15 00:36:45	@PikFan	oh, when I asked you if you just take layers and put it all together?
2015-11-15 00:36:47	@PikFan	no problem
2015-11-15 00:36:55	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 00:37:52	Yoyo	Pikmin isn't the only game that shamelessly advertises other nintendo franchises.
2015-11-15 00:38:44	@PikFan	that may be true, but I doubt that there'd be anything in a 10 second clip
2015-11-15 00:39:25	@PikFan	oh, by the way, I've been working on Mysterious World again
2015-11-15 00:39:42	Scruffy	Cool!
2015-11-15 00:39:44	@PikFan	I finished up the Snagret battle, and now I'm working on introducing the Winged Pikmin
2015-11-15 00:39:50	@PikFan	but...
2015-11-15 00:40:01	@J	75 hours...what sort of computer is that on?
2015-11-15 00:40:05	@PikFan	I dunno, I feel like it could be longer
2015-11-15 00:40:07	En_Passant	Even if there was advertisement, there certainly wouldn't be new details
2015-11-15 00:40:08	@PikFan	Macbook Pro
2015-11-15 00:40:22	Yoyo	windows 98
2015-11-15 00:40:24	Scruffy	There's no fancy GPU card or processor or anyhthing
2015-11-15 00:40:41	Scruffy	So I can do little else while this is going on
2015-11-15 00:40:59	Scruffy	But that's okay, now I know to render frames one at a time, not one whole video file
2015-11-15 00:41:09	Scruffy	That way you can stop the render anytime and lose no progress
2015-11-15 00:41:21	Yoyo	Fricken' solitare
2015-11-15 00:41:39	Scruffy	solitaire?
2015-11-15 00:41:56	Yoyo	Play solitare while you wait
2015-11-15 00:42:31	@PikFan	I-I'm not sure if anyone can play solitaire for 70 hours...
2015-11-15 00:42:48	@PikFan	also, here's what I've got for Chapter 5 so far: http://pastebin.com/SBFxtRM7
2015-11-15 00:42:52	@J	maybe you could find someone else to render your stuff, if it's easy to share a whole project around
2015-11-15 00:42:59	En_Passant	That's what game consoles are made for
2015-11-15 00:43:15	Yoyo	oh, no *moo*
2015-11-15 00:43:27	@J	what will happen when you're rendering multiple-minute videos?
2015-11-15 00:43:48	Yoyo	one of them will probably corrupt
2015-11-15 00:44:00	Scruffy	I either have to render every frame and store them on my computer, which is reliable but takes up space
2015-11-15 00:44:08	Scruffy	Or leave my computer rendering a video
2015-11-15 00:44:31	Scruffy	It's the most defeating thing to wake up one morning to "Blender has quit unexpectedly"
2015-11-15 00:44:49	Scruffy	Knowing that the video file it was working on is unsalvageable
2015-11-15 00:44:50	Yoyo	or getting blue-screened
2015-11-15 00:45:00	Scruffy	That doesn't happen on Macs
2015-11-15 00:45:12	Scruffy	I have seen the equivalent though
2015-11-15 00:45:27	Scruffy	A darkened filter sort of wipes across the screen
2015-11-15 00:45:38	Scruffy	It's very artistic for a computer failure
2015-11-15 00:45:48	Yoyo	Or apple servers could crash
2015-11-15 00:46:33	Scruffy	But to J, giving someone else the render is a good idea
2015-11-15 00:46:41	Yoyo	yep
2015-11-15 00:46:46	Scruffy	There's probably computers at my college that can do the trick easily
2015-11-15 00:46:59	Scruffy	I just need to find the lab, it's half an hour from where I am
2015-11-15 00:48:40	Scruffy	My computer can certainly handle this video for the time being though
2015-11-15 00:49:02	Scruffy	I think it's something Pikipedia and Pikmin fanon users alike could appreciate
2015-11-15 00:50:27	Yoyo	definitely
2015-11-15 00:54:04	Scruffy	PikFan, I like where this is going so far
2015-11-15 00:54:13	@PikFan	thanks
2015-11-15 00:54:16	Scruffy	I have two ideas for where it could go, if you're interested
2015-11-15 00:54:30	Scruffy	To further complicate matters
2015-11-15 00:54:37	@PikFan	heh, alright
2015-11-15 00:54:57	En_Passant	I think the unnamed Pikmin should die
2015-11-15 00:55:02	Scruffy	I think there should be one red Pikmin who didn't want the Tree Snagret to die
2015-11-15 00:55:10	En_Passant	It's not very threatening if everyone is saved
2015-11-15 00:55:24	Scruffy	I don't know why, but it would build inter-Onion tension
2015-11-15 00:55:39	@PikFan	three Pikmin were already killed
2015-11-15 00:55:55	En_Passant	A whole three
2015-11-15 00:55:59	En_Passant	I'm trembling in fear
2015-11-15 00:56:26	@PikFan	and I like that idea too
2015-11-15 00:56:48	@PikFan	actually, this reminds me, I was going to have Amber be suspicious of the Winged Pikmin
2015-11-15 00:57:01	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-15 00:57:03	Scruffy	Second thing
2015-11-15 00:57:12	Scruffy	Her suspicions should be well-founded
2015-11-15 00:57:22	Scruffy	The Winged Pikmin should not be trustworthy somehow
2015-11-15 00:57:42	@PikFan	I agree
2015-11-15 00:58:00	@PikFan	I mean, in the end, they will be allies, but I do want there to be that sense of unease
2015-11-15 00:58:07	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-15 00:58:10	@PikFan	at some point, there will be a betrayal of sorts
2015-11-15 00:59:49	@PikFan	En_Passant: ugh, fine, I can kill more Pikmin if you want
2015-11-15 01:01:37	@PikFan	also
2015-11-15 01:01:50	@PikFan	I'm thinking if having 7 more Pikmin types
2015-11-15 01:01:55	@PikFan	*thinking of
2015-11-15 01:01:59	Scruffy	7!
2015-11-15 01:01:59	Yoyo	seven?
2015-11-15 01:02:04	@PikFan	but they're going to be in the other world
2015-11-15 01:02:14	Scruffy	The mysterious one?
2015-11-15 01:02:20	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-15 01:02:20	Yoyo	Like, Hocotate?
2015-11-15 01:02:26	@PikFan	they're going to be the counterparts
2015-11-15 01:02:27	@PikFan	...no
2015-11-15 01:02:31	Scruffy	Oooh
2015-11-15 01:02:43	@PikFan	Hocotate won't have anything to do with this for a while
2015-11-15 01:02:43	Scruffy	reversed colors?
2015-11-15 01:02:43	Yoyo	Maybe mars
2015-11-15 01:02:45	@PikFan	a long while
2015-11-15 01:02:49	@PikFan	no
2015-11-15 01:02:54	@PikFan	parallel universe
2015-11-15 01:03:09	@PikFan	there'll be a portal to a parallel universe, containing a parallel PNF-404
2015-11-15 01:03:26	@PikFan	parallel PNF-404 = the Mysterious World
2015-11-15 01:03:45	@PikFan	and in it are the counterparts of the 7 canon Pikmin
2015-11-15 01:04:00	@PikFan	but yeah, I'm thinking reversed colors for some of them
2015-11-15 01:04:12	Yoyo	So an alternate universe, maybe where humans didn't go extinct
2015-11-15 01:04:36	@PikFan	good idea, but no
2015-11-15 01:04:46	@PikFan	sorry
2015-11-15 01:05:01	@PikFan	I don't want humans getting involved in this
2015-11-15 01:05:26	Yoyo	Reversed colors wouldn't work. there would be 2 yellows and 2 purples.
2015-11-15 01:05:40	@PikFan	17:04	PikFan	but yeah, I'm thinking reversed colors for some of them
2015-11-15 01:05:42	@PikFan	>some
2015-11-15 01:05:57	@PikFan	not all, just some
2015-11-15 01:06:00	Scruffy	Good
2015-11-15 01:06:10	Scruffy	A parallel universe doesn't have to be opposit
2015-11-15 01:06:15	Scruffy	opposite*
2015-11-15 01:06:20	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-15 01:06:24	@PikFan	let's see...
2015-11-15 01:06:26	Yoyo	yep.
2015-11-15 01:06:36	@PikFan	Cyan, Brown, Orange, Green
2015-11-15 01:06:43	@PikFan	now we just need 3 more
2015-11-15 01:06:56	@PikFan	oh, Black
2015-11-15 01:06:58	Scruffy	Crystal Pikmin to counter Rocks
2015-11-15 01:07:01	@PikFan	ooooooh
2015-11-15 01:07:06	@PikFan	excellent
2015-11-15 01:07:09	Scruffy	A Pikmin made of the thing Rocks destroy
2015-11-15 01:07:11	Yoyo	Maybe the dimension where the water rape's physical form is anchored
2015-11-15 01:07:33	@PikFan	water rape? lol
2015-11-15 01:07:42	Scruffy	I certainly hope it's not that dimension
2015-11-15 01:07:47	Yoyo	That's what I call it
2015-11-15 01:08:11	@PikFan	well then
2015-11-15 01:08:25	Yoyo	But it could be cool.
2015-11-15 01:08:32	@PikFan	okay, and then what would the counterpart of Wingeds be?
2015-11-15 01:08:39	@PikFan	I'm not sure about that
2015-11-15 01:08:46	Yoyo	Diglet pikmin?
2015-11-15 01:08:47	Scruffy	Chicken Pikmin
2015-11-15 01:08:55	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-15 01:09:11	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-11-15 01:09:29	Yoyo	EMPikmin to counter the yellows
2015-11-15 01:09:54	@PikFan	nah
2015-11-15 01:10:25	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm
2015-11-15 01:10:37	Yoyo	they could be heavy? and disable bomb rocks
2015-11-15 01:10:50	@PikFan	well, we've already got heavies
2015-11-15 01:10:53	@PikFan	Purples
2015-11-15 01:11:33	Yoyo	The alternate universe could have actual voice acting.
2015-11-15 01:11:44	@PikFan	well, what if there isn't a counterpart for Wingeds
2015-11-15 01:11:52	Scruffy	If this became an audiobook, perhaps
2015-11-15 01:12:10	@PikFan	what if Wingeds are actually a cross-dimensional type
2015-11-15 01:12:16	Scruffy	Oh
2015-11-15 01:12:18	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 01:12:18	@PikFan	different color, sure
2015-11-15 01:12:26	@PikFan	but still Wingeds
2015-11-15 01:12:36	@PikFan	maybe like a magenta color?
2015-11-15 01:12:37	Scruffy	Their increased mobility is a good symbol
2015-11-15 01:12:59	@PikFan	some sort of dark red color, to counter the normal pink
2015-11-15 01:13:01	Yoyo	can we nerf winges so that they can't cheese every puzzle.
2015-11-15 01:13:15	@PikFan	I didn't understand what you just said
2015-11-15 01:13:22	@PikFan	cheese every puzzle?
2015-11-15 01:13:22	Yoyo	Dark green maybe
2015-11-15 01:13:33	@PikFan	17:13	PikFan	some sort of dark red color, to counter the normal pink
2015-11-15 01:13:34	Scruffy	Nerf is downgrading the power of something
2015-11-15 01:13:36	Scruffy	in a game
2015-11-15 01:14:00	@PikFan	no, I know that, I just didn't know what he meant by "cheese every puzzle"
2015-11-15 01:14:03	Scruffy	Cheesing is either gratuitous cheating or repeating the same move in Smash
2015-11-15 01:14:14	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-15 01:15:07	Yoyo	like you lock onto the mango in tropical wilds, skipping the whole puzzle.
2015-11-15 01:15:09	@PikFan	okay, so we've got Orange, Cyan, Green, Brown, Black, Crystal, and Winged
2015-11-15 01:15:44	@PikFan	in addition to Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White, Rock, and Winged
2015-11-15 01:16:10	Scruffy	sounds good
2015-11-15 01:16:14	Scruffy	What a cast
2015-11-15 01:16:17	Yoyo	Maybe bulbmin could return
2015-11-15 01:16:20	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-15 01:16:21	Scruffy	You've gotta keep track of all of them
2015-11-15 01:16:22	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-15 01:16:32	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2015-11-15 01:16:41	Scruffy	Would bulbmin be pets?
2015-11-15 01:16:46	@PikFan	I'm not sure
2015-11-15 01:17:04	@PikFan	I'll ignore Bulbmin for now
2015-11-15 01:17:15	Yoyo	what you do in one universe could affect the other universe
2015-11-15 01:17:19	@PikFan	okay, so we've got the alternate types down
2015-11-15 01:17:22	@PikFan	great
2015-11-15 01:17:55	Scruffy	Now what is the big sentient villain creature we skipped over miles to hear about
2015-11-15 01:18:17	@PikFan	the leader of the monsters, basically
2015-11-15 01:18:18	Scruffy	oops, heh, multiples of mile
2015-11-15 01:18:26	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-15 01:19:02	@PikFan	in Chapter 1, the last line said "Watchful, analytical eyes."
2015-11-15 01:19:12	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2015-11-15 01:19:13	@PikFan	so I wanted to return to that
2015-11-15 01:19:55	@PikFan	also, I'm not sure what to do about Ignis
2015-11-15 01:20:01	Yoyo	Let's see if we can avoid taking inspiration from umizobu
2015-11-15 01:20:22	@PikFan	because early on in Chapter 4, Amber mentions that there was an incident before with another Sproutling that had Elem
2015-11-15 01:20:22	Scruffy	Oh, yeah, how would they know what the Reds are doing from so far away?
2015-11-15 01:20:38	@PikFan	magic
2015-11-15 01:20:46	@PikFan	literally, magic
2015-11-15 01:20:55	@PikFan	or should I say, Elem
2015-11-15 01:20:56	Scruffy	ah
2015-11-15 01:21:00	Scruffy	ahhhh
2015-11-15 01:21:07	Scruffy	Ok, that makes sense
2015-11-15 01:21:11	Scruffy	Or, well, fictional sense
2015-11-15 01:21:18	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-11-15 01:21:54	@PikFan	I'm thinking that some enemies will also have Elem
2015-11-15 01:22:16	@PikFan	wouldn't be very fair if only the Pikmin had it
2015-11-15 01:22:28	Scruffy	As in summoning elements? Enemies can already do that
2015-11-15 01:22:39	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-15 01:22:40	@PikFan	derp
2015-11-15 01:23:01	Yoyo	Elemental immunity for some enimies.
2015-11-15 01:24:12	Scruffy	I feel like enemies with Elem should not wield their elements
2015-11-15 01:24:28	Scruffy	They should instead have an obligation to protect something
2015-11-15 01:24:32	Scruffy	Like a tree
2015-11-15 01:24:40	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-15 01:24:46	Scruffy	Perhaps the Tree Snagret was guarding the tree
2015-11-15 01:25:00	Scruffy	It did say to the Pikmin that they disturbed ti
2015-11-15 01:25:04	@PikFan	she was guarding her eggs, but sure
2015-11-15 01:25:14	Scruffy	Otherwise it was kind of useless to try to talk to it
2015-11-15 01:25:27	En_Passant	Cheesing is neither of those things
2015-11-15 01:25:32	En_Passant	Wait, dang
2015-11-15 01:25:39	En_Passant	Forgot I was reading the log
2015-11-15 01:25:45	Scruffy	Oh dear
2015-11-15 01:25:51	Scruffy	Perhaps I've been misled
2015-11-15 01:25:51	@PikFan	?
2015-11-15 01:26:03	Scruffy	But that's how my roommates use "cheesing"
2015-11-15 01:26:11	Scruffy	It fites
2015-11-15 01:26:13	Scruffy	fits*
2015-11-15 01:26:43	@PikFan	google says "exasperate, frustrate, or bore"
2015-11-15 01:26:54	En_Passant	Cheesing is when you do something the easy way
2015-11-15 01:26:56	@PikFan	and then there's a much more inappropriate definition
2015-11-15 01:27:18	En_Passant	For example, in Mario Maker, pretty much any time a Lakitu appears, you can use its cloud to fly over the level
2015-11-15 01:27:19	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-15 01:27:31	En_Passant	That's called cheesing the level
2015-11-15 01:27:37	Scruffy	That makes sense
2015-11-15 01:27:44	Scruffy	I guess i just misinterpreted it
2015-11-15 01:27:58	En_Passant	So, in Pikmin, you can skip a lot of puzzles by using exploits with Winged Pikmin
2015-11-15 01:28:02	Scruffy	Right
2015-11-15 01:28:09	En_Passant	Watch Miles' speedruns for examples
2015-11-15 01:28:13	Yoyo	I brought this upon you, and I am sorry.
2015-11-15 01:28:25	Scruffy	No no it's no trouble
2015-11-15 01:28:30	Scruffy	Thank you En_Passant
2015-11-15 01:28:55	Scruffy	I learn a new word every week on average
2015-11-15 01:29:17	Yoyo	Pikmin teaches you things.
2015-11-15 01:29:23	Scruffy	Absolutely
2015-11-15 01:29:33	Scruffy	I feel it could be a good educational game
2015-11-15 01:29:51	Yoyo	Like carrots can fight for you.
2015-11-15 01:30:03	@PikFan	lol
2015-11-15 01:30:11	Scruffy	Heh
2015-11-15 01:31:02	Scruffy	Something doesn't add up
2015-11-15 01:31:09	Yoyo	If it has nothing to do with hocotate, then no Olimar, Louie.
2015-11-15 01:31:26	Scruffy	Ignis believes in using teamwork to take down the snagret
2015-11-15 01:31:30	Scruffy	But then charges in alone
2015-11-15 01:31:44	Yoyo	Wierd
2015-11-15 01:31:56	@PikFan	hm, true
2015-11-15 01:31:56	Scruffy	And I feel that Ruby gives in very quickly
2015-11-15 01:32:13	Scruffy	Saying there's no reason to attack or negotiate
2015-11-15 01:32:14	@PikFan	gives in to attacking it?
2015-11-15 01:32:27	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-15 01:32:32	@PikFan	gives up entirely
2015-11-15 01:32:41	Yoyo	Can you link me to this
2015-11-15 01:32:48	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/SBFxtRM7

2015-11-15 01:34:25	@PikFan	well, she doesn't really give up
2015-11-15 01:34:31	@PikFan	she just wants to escape
2015-11-15 01:34:43	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-15 01:34:47	@PikFan	but seeing as the tunnel is blocked, she realizes they have no choice but to fight
2015-11-15 01:35:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 01:35:31	@PikFan	also, with the thing about Ignis rushing in alone, I could add a few more Pikmin going in, too
2015-11-15 01:35:42	Scruffy	Sure
2015-11-15 01:35:47	Scruffy	if halfheartedly
2015-11-15 01:36:08	@PikFan	I mean, the others are quite fearful and scared, but Ignis is a very headstrong character
2015-11-15 01:36:25	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 01:36:33	Scruffy	on account of the fire in his head
2015-11-15 01:36:39	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-11-15 01:36:41	Scruffy	But is that how Red Pikmin are?
2015-11-15 01:36:52	Scruffy	Brave on the surface but fearful?
2015-11-15 01:37:01	@PikFan	they're usually brave
2015-11-15 01:37:07	@PikFan	Snagrets are the exception
2015-11-15 01:37:11	Scruffy	I feel like they'd go into an area with a little more idea that there'd be some dangerous creature lurkin
2015-11-15 01:37:14	Scruffy	Ah I see
2015-11-15 01:37:17	@PikFan	all Pikmin fear Snagrets
2015-11-15 01:37:22	Scruffy	Snagretophobia
2015-11-15 01:37:24	@PikFan	even Reds
2015-11-15 01:37:27	@PikFan	yep
2015-11-15 01:38:03	@PikFan	but since this is Ignis's second time seeing a Snagret, he doesn't really have much fear
2015-11-15 01:38:16	@PikFan	well, as much fear as the others, anyway
2015-11-15 01:38:17	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 01:39:03	Scruffy	Oh, one more thing
2015-11-15 01:39:09	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-11-15 01:39:28	Scruffy	I don't think Ignis should be so smug after he first attacks
2015-11-15 01:39:33	Scruffy	That's how his attitude seems
2015-11-15 01:39:37	Scruffy	"Heh, sorry..."
2015-11-15 01:39:48	Scruffy	It doesn't really come off as meek
2015-11-15 01:40:08	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-15 01:40:08	Scruffy	I feel like he should be out of it
2015-11-15 01:40:21	Scruffy	Like what just happened was all a blur
2015-11-15 01:40:46	@PikFan	in my head, I didn't think of him as being smug, but sure
2015-11-15 01:40:57	@PikFan	I can rewrite that
2015-11-15 01:41:04	Scruffy	Sorry, that's just how it sounded to me when I read it
2015-11-15 01:41:22	@PikFan	it's fine
2015-11-15 01:41:43	Scruffy	Otherwise I think it's going well
2015-11-15 01:42:07	Scruffy	Everything is really interesting and you've left a lot of good and burning questions
2015-11-15 01:42:16	@PikFan	"I dunno, I..." Ignis meekly said.
2015-11-15 01:42:18	@PikFan	how's that?
2015-11-15 01:42:23	Scruffy	That's better
2015-11-15 01:42:29	Scruffy	Yeah, that works
2015-11-15 01:42:36	@PikFan	well, change "meekly said" to "mumbled"
2015-11-15 01:43:30	Scruffy	Great
2015-11-15 01:43:46	Scruffy	It seems more in line with how you've characterized him so far

2015-11-15 02:04:25	Testyo	I said one of our informal memos to the official docs because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages one of these newfangled stereojacks and but I'm now passing them from our informal memos to the official docs.

2015-11-15 02:07:16	Yoyo	OK
2015-11-15 02:40:05	Yoyo	With the best ending in Pikmin 1, those maybe weren't all the onions. Maybe there are hundreds of types of Pikmin that weren't in that group.
2015-11-15 02:40:17	@PikFan	who knows
2015-11-15 02:43:17	Yoyo	So that's interesting, all Pikmin types are unique. Meaning that there are a metric cluster*moo* of ideas for Nintendo to come up with.
2015-11-15 02:43:58	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-11-15 02:45:17	Yoyo	Pikmin is resembling Pokemon.
2015-11-15 02:45:36	@PikFan	how so
2015-11-15 02:47:20	Yoyo	Pikmin is adding more and more Pikmin to the series at each installment. Kind of like Pokemon.
2015-11-15 02:47:44	@PikFan	but there's hundreds of types of Pokemon
2015-11-15 02:47:53	@PikFan	so far, there's only 7 types of Pikmin
2015-11-15 02:48:20	Yoyo	Best ending of Pikmin 1, I need you!

2015-11-15 14:16:51	@Espyo	I've been blocked on wikia
2015-11-15 14:17:45	Yoshi2	Espyo: gg
2015-11-15 14:17:52	@Espyo	globally, it seems
2015-11-15 14:17:59	@Espyo	and didn't get any message regarding it
2015-11-15 14:18:52	Yoshi2	pretty odd
2015-11-15 14:19:05	@Espyo	meanwhile kirbyddd's been going nuts "cleaning" the wiki
2015-11-15 14:19:09	@Espyo	son of a bitch is probably trying to get adminship
2015-11-15 14:19:10	Testyo	You're using quite the colorful words, aren't you?
2015-11-15 14:20:54	Yoshi2	Testyo: there is a reason to be upset
2015-11-15 14:20:55	Testyo	I have said it failed
2015-11-15 14:21:34	@Espyo	not that I can't create n accounts
2015-11-15 14:21:38	@Espyo	proxy it if I need to
2015-11-15 14:22:03	Yoshi2	heh
2015-11-15 14:22:26	@Espyo	one problem at a time, I'm going to talk to kirbyddd
2015-11-15 14:29:35	Yoshi2	for some reason, I'm not really looking forward to this winter
2015-11-15 14:29:52	Yoshi2	it will be cold, it will be dark, and yet there won't be much snow (likely)
2015-11-15 14:30:02	Yoshi2	stupid global warming

2015-11-15 14:53:14	@Espyo	so we can talk this through some day
2015-11-15 14:53:28	@Espyo	the plan is to try to understand what's going on in the mind of that psychopath
2015-11-15 14:53:31	@Espyo	it's simple, really
2015-11-15 14:53:43	@Espyo	with us out of the picture, figuratively, he's trying to gain adminship on a Pikmin wiki
2015-11-15 14:53:50	@Espyo	because he's a spoiled brat with mental disabilities
2015-11-15 14:53:57	Scruffy	Truly, what could have justified your ban?
2015-11-15 14:54:05	@Espyo	I think our best bet is to guilt-trip him into not doing it
2015-11-15 14:54:16	@Espyo	supposedly, violation of the TOS
2015-11-15 14:54:19	@Espyo	which isn't true, btw
2015-11-15 14:54:22	@Espyo	but you know
2015-11-15 14:54:25	@Espyo	wikia loves money
2015-11-15 14:54:36	@Espyo	and one less user on wikia because I notified them of the move = less money
2015-11-15 14:54:39	@Espyo	so I'm an immediate threat
2015-11-15 14:54:44	@Espyo	so they ban me, and without warning
2015-11-15 14:54:49	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-15 14:54:50	@Espyo	and now their dollars are safe in their warm pockets
2015-11-15 14:54:52	Yoshi2	yuuuuup
2015-11-15 14:55:01	@Espyo	breaking the TOS or not, they saw it as me deserving it
2015-11-15 14:55:16	Scruffy	Took them a while
2015-11-15 14:55:21	@Espyo	yeah
2015-11-15 14:55:30	@Espyo	things aren't looking good
2015-11-15 14:55:36	Scruffy	But still, you don't deserve it
2015-11-15 14:55:37	@Espyo	but we still have a big chance
2015-11-15 14:55:40	@Espyo	of course I don't
2015-11-15 14:55:43	@Espyo	but I do in their eyes
2015-11-15 14:55:57	@Espyo	all I did was keep a dead wiki dead and stop problems from happening
2015-11-15 14:55:58	Scruffy	Heh, "things aren't looking good"
2015-11-15 14:55:59	@Espyo	but nope, money
2015-11-15 14:56:06	Scruffy	"I need orders, quick!"
2015-11-15 14:56:10	@Espyo	I can't tell people to come to Pikipedia any more
2015-11-15 14:56:10	@Espyo	heh
2015-11-15 14:56:21	Scruffy	Wait, why not?
2015-11-15 14:56:21	@Espyo	but either way, Pikmin 4 will be a great help

2015-11-15 14:56:50	@Espyo	miscommunication here :|
2015-11-15 14:56:54	Scruffy	Sorry
2015-11-15 14:57:11	@Espyo	no, now I actually want to know where you thought the ban was
2015-11-15 14:57:12	@Espyo	curious
2015-11-15 14:57:33	@J	I thought he was talking about where you can tell people to go to Pikipedia
2015-11-15 14:57:37	@J	not where you're banned
2015-11-15 14:57:43	Scruffy	Oh, I knew it was from wikia, I just thought it was too dangerous to tell /anyone/
2015-11-15 14:57:46	@J	he thought you meant telling people on other sites
2015-11-15 14:57:49	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-11-15 14:57:55	@J	also hi everyone
2015-11-15 14:57:57	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-15 14:57:58	Scruffy	Hi
2015-11-15 14:58:09	@Espyo	well, either way, with the workforce we have, and Pikmin 4 coming in hot
2015-11-15 14:58:13	@Espyo	I think we have a massive lead
2015-11-15 14:58:16	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 14:58:18	@Espyo	plus with reddit and such on our side
2015-11-15 14:58:25	@Espyo	still, we'll be seeing a lot of activity on the wikia
2015-11-15 14:58:35	Scruffy	Not enough accuracy though
2015-11-15 14:58:44	@Espyo	luckily, Pikmin attracts so many young editors, that most of their edits are crap factoids with poor grammar, while our edits are pure content all the way
2015-11-15 14:58:48	Yoshi2	how is pikmin 4 coming in hot?
2015-11-15 14:58:49	@J	wait, I thought there was no Pikmin 4 news
2015-11-15 14:59:00	@Espyo	well, in the next few months we'll get news for sure
2015-11-15 14:59:17	@Espyo	not HOT hot
2015-11-15 14:59:19	@Espyo	but still coming
2015-11-15 14:59:20	@J	it's nice to be optimistic
2015-11-15 14:59:26	Scruffy	It better not be for NX, I can't take another Pikmin console-cross
2015-11-15 14:59:33	@Espyo	I'd rather be realistic
2015-11-15 14:59:36	@Espyo	and realistically, we have the advantage
2015-11-15 14:59:40	Scruffy	Well, I can, but it'd be nice
2015-11-15 14:59:45	@Espyo	same
2015-11-15 15:00:09	@J	is NX Nintendo's next console?
2015-11-15 15:00:18	@J	(I don't follow console news at all any more)
2015-11-15 15:00:18	Scruffy	Purportedly
2015-11-15 15:00:27	Yoshi2	NX is nintendo's next platform
2015-11-15 15:00:30	Scruffy	No news has been released about it
2015-11-15 15:00:41	Yoshi2	nothing about what exactly it will be tho

2015-11-15 15:01:53	Scruffy	Besides an ergonomic controller
2015-11-15 15:02:00	@Espyo	I think I should talk to the subreddit admins and ask them if I can have a bot that automatically links people to Pikipedia when they post wikia links
2015-11-15 15:02:08	@Espyo	on reddit, there are bots everywhere that do these sort of things
2015-11-15 15:02:19	@Espyo	like when people on mobile post a link to m.wikipedia.org, the mobile version
2015-11-15 15:02:26	@Espyo	people on desktop get sent to the mobile version
2015-11-15 15:02:34	@Espyo	so a bot detects it and shows a link to the desktop version
2015-11-15 15:02:42	Yoshi2	could be done
2015-11-15 15:02:47	@Espyo	also with a nicely written post about how we just CAN'T have two wikis
2015-11-15 15:02:56	@Espyo	it really isn't about our "product" being better than wikia's "product"
2015-11-15 15:02:56	@J	wow
2015-11-15 15:03:07	@Espyo	it's that nobody can afford another episode with two Pikmin wikis
2015-11-15 15:03:14	@Espyo	two wikis working at half efficiency each
2015-11-15 15:03:15	@Espyo	ugh

2015-11-15 15:12:29	Yoshi2	(I actually never watched any of his videos)
2015-11-15 15:12:45	Scruffy	I watch them for Pikmin music reference
2015-11-15 15:13:38	Yoyo	Watch his videos. He just finished the story of Pikmin 3.
2015-11-15 15:14:19	Yoshi2	I never collected all the food in pikmin 3 after finishing the story
2015-11-15 15:14:46	Yoyo	Why is that?
2015-11-15 15:15:12	Yoshi2	no idea
2015-11-15 15:15:27	Yoshi2	I tried to collect the remaining food, but it wasn't as exciting as I hoped it to be
2015-11-15 15:15:35	Yoyo	Check your fruit radar.
2015-11-15 15:16:14	Yoshi2	I know all I'd have to do is to send my three characters with pikmins to various spots
2015-11-15 15:17:17	Yoyo	Have you collected all types?
2015-11-15 15:19:14	Yoyo	Of fruit, I mean.
2015-11-15 15:19:42	Yoshi2	I probably collected at least one of each type
2015-11-15 15:20:53	Yoyo	Some fruits were easy to put in because they were treasures from Pikmin 2.
2015-11-15 15:21:20	Scruffy	Well, they had to update the models and textures
2015-11-15 15:21:30	Scruffy	They aren't exactly the same as the treasures

2015-11-15 15:57:40	Yoshi2	well, he stole the food
2015-11-15 15:58:42	Yoyo	He seemed to take on a more antagonistic role.
2015-11-15 16:03:38	Scruffy	I'd say he's the most complex character in the series
2015-11-15 16:03:51	Scruffy	Or could be at least
2015-11-15 16:13:59	Yoyo	Yep.
2015-11-15 16:15:53	Yoyo	He's tied with water rape and plasm wraith.

2015-11-15 16:59:13	Scruffy	Except I don't like that she took the left hand up an octave
2015-11-15 16:59:28	Scruffy	I prefer it in the lower register, it's no more or less "musical"
2015-11-15 16:59:40	Scruffy	But that's how it originally was
2015-11-15 17:05:18	Yoyo	I like it both ways.
2015-11-15 17:06:00	Yoyo	At least it wasn't a black MIDI.
2015-11-15 18:25:27	Yoyo	All the music in Pikmin games is good.

2015-11-15 18:55:46	Yoyo	Where 1 weight equals 1 mg.

2015-11-15 22:04:20	@PikFan	and also, we'd spread the misinformation very slowly
2015-11-15 22:04:28	@PikFan	to further minimize chances of being banned
2015-11-15 22:04:36	Scruffy	It's low
2015-11-15 22:04:57	Yoyo	Actually.
2015-11-15 22:05:09	@PikFan	like, we could change stats on enemy infoboxes
2015-11-15 22:05:13	Yoyo	I don't have an account.
2015-11-15 22:05:23	@PikFan	...I'm not asking YOU to do it
2015-11-15 22:05:31	@PikFan	it's only a suggestion
2015-11-15 22:05:52	@PikFan	...eh, never mind
2015-11-15 22:05:53	@Espyo	they'd catch on
2015-11-15 22:06:00	@Espyo	plus that little prick kirby would revert it
2015-11-15 22:06:11	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-11-15 22:06:14	@PikFan	gah
2015-11-15 22:06:16	Yoyo	I'm just saying that we should do it while logged off of our account
2015-11-15 22:06:28	@PikFan	anons can't edit the Pikmin Wikia
2015-11-15 22:06:37	Yoyo	OK.
2015-11-15 22:07:03	Scruffy	They can comment though, can't they?
2015-11-15 22:07:13	Scruffy	Is that really all they can do?
2015-11-15 22:07:18	@PikFan	nope
2015-11-15 22:07:22	@PikFan	as far as I know
2015-11-15 22:07:33	Scruffy	No, not even that
2015-11-15 22:07:35	@PikFan	the only thing they can do is read articles and make an account
2015-11-15 22:07:44	Scruffy	So much for giving people a choice
2015-11-15 22:08:10	@PikFan	exactly
2015-11-15 22:08:13	Scruffy	If someone finds an error here they can fix it in a snap
2015-11-15 22:08:17	@PikFan	they won't allow people to argue
2015-11-15 22:08:24	Yoyo	Just chatroom, reading articles, and polls.
2015-11-15 22:08:24	@PikFan	or fix things, yeah
2015-11-15 22:08:46	@PikFan	oh yeah, polls
2015-11-15 22:10:59	Yoyo	This is going to be like going up against ten of each boss. With crippled Pikmin.
2015-11-15 22:11:38	@PikFan	when Pikmin 4 rolls around, we have to try our hardest to not let Pikmin Wiki grow again
2015-11-15 22:12:06	Yoyo	We just need to get better staff.
2015-11-15 22:14:14	Scruffy	Oh, I just uploaded some PF music
2015-11-15 22:14:21	Scruffy	It's for the tutorial on Day 1
2015-11-15 22:14:54	Yoyo	Neat.
2015-11-15 22:14:56	Scruffy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJhO9pzSac&feature=youtu.be
2015-11-15 22:15:29	@PikFan	Forest of Hope remix
2015-11-15 22:15:47	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 22:15:56	Scruffy	I wanted to homage
2015-11-15 22:16:01	@PikFan	I like it
2015-11-15 22:16:09	Scruffy	Thanks!
2015-11-15 22:16:19	Yoyo	I like it. It makes me feel nostalgia.
2015-11-15 22:16:27	@PikFan	by the way Scruffy
2015-11-15 22:16:38	@PikFan	was there anything else that you wanted to say about Chapter 5?
2015-11-15 22:17:42	Scruffy	I don't think so, I think everything's good at the moment
2015-11-15 22:17:54	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-15 22:18:02	Scruffy	I like the more detailed account of the battle with the Snagret
2015-11-15 22:18:14	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-15 22:20:19	Yoyo	Maybe you could've done more with winged Pikmin doing stuff.
2015-11-15 22:20:31	@PikFan	well
2015-11-15 22:20:38	@PikFan	I'm actually working on that
2015-11-15 22:22:36	Yoyo	Maybe there could be one with wind Elem. The leader of Wings.
2015-11-15 22:23:11	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-15 22:23:17	Scruffy	Wind elem is a cool idea
2015-11-15 22:24:34	Scruffy	Brb
2015-11-15 22:24:48	Yoyo	Really, all types except for purples I have an idea what their Elem could be.
2015-11-15 22:30:42	@PikFan	hey Scruffy, do you mind if I share one of your renders on Google+?
2015-11-15 22:31:33	@PikFan	there's this Pikmin community on it and I thought that I'd share one of your renders there
2015-11-15 22:35:15	Yoyo	You might wanna wait, he's probably gone off to eat dinner.
2015-11-15 22:35:26	@PikFan	I am waiting
2015-11-15 22:38:22	Scruffy	Back
2015-11-15 22:38:30	Scruffy	Sorry, I did have dinner
2015-11-15 22:38:39	@PikFan	oh, okau
2015-11-15 22:38:40	@PikFan	*okay
2015-11-15 22:38:46	Scruffy	Which render?
2015-11-15 22:38:54	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-11-15 22:39:20	@PikFan	the Infernal Emperor Bulblax, maybe?
2015-11-15 22:39:50	Scruffy	Sure! No problem
2015-11-15 22:39:53	Scruffy	Just, umm
2015-11-15 22:40:03	@PikFan	I'll credit you, of course
2015-11-15 22:40:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 22:40:10	Scruffy	Thank you
2015-11-15 22:40:24	Scruffy	By all means, then, go ahead
2015-11-15 22:40:53	@PikFan	the community's only got 67 members, so it's not terribly big
2015-11-15 22:41:17	Scruffy	That's more than I expected :o
2015-11-15 22:41:27	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-15 22:41:35	Scruffy	I keep forgetting how big these communities are
2015-11-15 22:41:41	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-15 22:41:46	Scruffy	Don't worry, I'm fine with you sharing it
2015-11-15 22:41:47	@PikFan	https://plus.google.com/communities/105120992058010865282
2015-11-15 22:41:51	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-15 22:41:58	Yoyo	BRB
2015-11-15 22:47:47	Scruffy	So every type of Pikmin will have one with Elem?
2015-11-15 22:47:53	Scruffy	Or are they just generally rare
2015-11-15 22:47:58	@PikFan	at least, yeah
2015-11-15 22:48:27	@PikFan	there will be characters that don't have Elem
2015-11-15 22:48:50	Scruffy	Of course
2015-11-15 22:49:19	@PikFan	also, for the Winged Pikmin, I've come up with two names: Aura and Zephry
2015-11-15 22:49:31	@PikFan	the latter is a wordplay of "zephyr"
2015-11-15 22:50:42	Scruffy	nice
2015-11-15 22:51:11	Scruffy	And then Gust
2015-11-15 22:51:20	Scruffy	Perhaps
2015-11-15 22:51:46	Scruffy	or Pinion
2015-11-15 22:51:59	@PikFan	Pinion? ooh
2015-11-15 22:52:06	@PikFan	how'd you come up with that?
2015-11-15 22:52:13	Scruffy	It's the outer part of a bird's wing
2015-11-15 22:52:21	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-15 22:56:36	@PikFan	well, I like it
2015-11-15 22:56:40	@PikFan	(was distracted)
2015-11-15 22:56:41	Scruffy	Cool
2015-11-15 22:56:45	Scruffy	(Me too)
2015-11-15 23:04:09	Scruffy	Just found this, so happy Nintendo supports my idea of Louie's characterization
2015-11-15 23:04:10	Scruffy	https://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2009/Louie-s-Notes-Musings-of-a-Sidekick-251422.html
2015-11-15 23:04:18	Scruffy	In Pikmin 2's events, at least
2015-11-15 23:06:03	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-15 23:10:34	Yoyo	Louie broke the fourth wall.
2015-11-15 23:10:42	Scruffy	Where?
2015-11-15 23:10:50	Scruffy	Oh, in that thing
2015-11-15 23:10:51	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-15 23:13:35	Yoyo	But each Pikmin will have special traits due to them being Pikmin. Elem is not the only thing that makes a character important.
2015-11-15 23:13:53	Scruffy	of course
2015-11-15 23:13:54	@PikFan	of course
2015-11-15 23:13:57	@PikFan	jinx
2015-11-15 23:14:32	Yoyo	Louie could discover the Pikmin tribes maybe.
2015-11-15 23:14:52	@PikFan	like I said, Hocotatians won't be involved in this for a very long time
2015-11-15 23:14:53	@PikFan	if at all
2015-11-15 23:14:57	Scruffy	Wait, who's story are you referring to?
2015-11-15 23:15:01	Scruffy	whose
2015-11-15 23:15:04	@PikFan	mine, I think
2015-11-15 23:15:19	Scruffy	Ah ok
2015-11-15 23:20:47	Testyo	it opens Uzbl using taken straight from one of the Pikmin games
2015-11-15 23:22:05	Yoyo	But even when Hocotate does get involved, I don't think Olimar should be in it.
2015-11-15 23:22:29	@PikFan	mmkay
2015-11-15 23:24:26	Yoyo	Remember, Louie isn't on Hocotate. He has been on Pikmin not found error code 404 (PNF-404) for the past two games.
2015-11-15 23:26:35	Scruffy	When are the events of MW again?
2015-11-15 23:27:02	@PikFan	after P3
2015-11-15 23:27:27	@PikFan	I'm not sure how the Awakening Wood could have survived, but eh
2015-11-15 23:28:30	@PikFan	the P2 areas look like they're really close, but the P3 areas are very far apart
2015-11-15 23:28:50	Yoyo	What I don't get is how distant spring changed so much in 3 days.
2015-11-15 23:29:05	@PikFan	3 days?
2015-11-15 23:29:13	Scruffy	Maybe I could include a reference to Mysterious World in my story of Louie
2015-11-15 23:29:23	@PikFan	sure, if you'd like
2015-11-15 23:29:31	@PikFan	that'd be pretty cool!
2015-11-15 23:29:40	Scruffy	just a little nod to it
2015-11-15 23:29:45	@PikFan	speaking of, how's it going'/
2015-11-15 23:29:46	Scruffy	Like maybe in a dream Louie has or something
2015-11-15 23:29:47	Yoyo	I got to perplexing pool on day 3
2015-11-15 23:29:47	@PikFan	?
2015-11-15 23:30:05	@PikFan	...that's not possible
2015-11-15 23:30:34	Yoyo	It is possible, if your really fast.
2015-11-15 23:30:41	@PikFan	nope
2015-11-15 23:30:51	Scruffy	It's going a lot better than before
2015-11-15 23:31:01	Yoyo	OK it was day 4.
2015-11-15 23:31:03	@PikFan	the game forces you to spend 2 days at the Valley of Repose, then another day at the Awakening Wood
2015-11-15 23:31:10	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-15 23:31:25	@PikFan	and that's good, Scruffy
2015-11-15 23:31:29	Scruffy	Thanks
2015-11-15 23:31:34	Yoyo	Nice.
2015-11-15 23:31:53	Scruffy	I went with your advice, starting off with a description of Louie's childhood, and then talking about his parents
2015-11-15 23:32:03	Scruffy	Not the other way around
2015-11-15 23:32:29	Scruffy	And it's a lot better that way, I can characterize Louie a lot quicker
2015-11-15 23:33:33	Yoyo	And hopefully Nintendo does the same.
2015-11-15 23:37:38	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-15 23:38:56	Scruffy	I have to get going, I might be on in a couple hours, like 3 or 4
2015-11-15 23:39:04	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-15 23:39:06	@PikFan	bye
2015-11-15 23:39:11	Scruffy	see ya

2015-11-16 19:40:25	Scruffy	How is your case going with the ban from wikia?
2015-11-16 19:40:52	@Espyo	no progress
2015-11-16 19:40:56	@Espyo	and I won't really do anything about it

2015-11-16 20:18:07	@Espyo	I remember those days

2015-11-16 20:19:16	@Espyo	well, yeah
2015-11-16 20:20:01	Yoyo	But anyways, what's happening with you.
2015-11-16 20:21:47	@Espyo	not much, to be honest
2015-11-16 20:21:57	@Espyo	I have kind of a confusing task at work, but I can manage

2015-11-16 20:22:38	Yoyo	That could be a problem.
2015-11-16 20:23:50	@Espyo	well, I'll just pull out the game and check the locations from a previous day
2015-11-16 20:23:53	@Espyo	...but I can't be bothered to get up
2015-11-16 20:25:07	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'm not sure what that wikia layout was supposed to improve
2015-11-16 20:25:23	Yoyo	There is just so much on PNF-404 (Pikmin/planet/parts not found error code 404).
2015-11-16 20:25:55	@Espyo	...improvements?

2015-11-16 20:33:20	Yoyo	What do you mean?
2015-11-16 20:33:40	@Espyo	in the UK, you write encyclopaedia, right?
2015-11-16 20:34:03	Yoyo	I'm American.
2015-11-16 20:34:30	@Espyo	yeah, but in the UK, that's the spelling for "encyclopedia"
2015-11-16 20:35:43	Yoyo	I think so. Kind of like aluminum, or aluminium for all you British people out there.
2015-11-16 20:36:04	@Espyo	mhm
2015-11-16 20:37:18	Yoshi2	aluminum?
2015-11-16 20:37:49	Yoshi2	... oh god, that's an actual spelling
2015-11-16 20:38:04	@Espyo	hehe
2015-11-16 20:38:12	Yoshi2	I have to back the British people here, as in German it's Aluminium
2015-11-16 20:40:05	Yoyo	Apparently America wanted to be SO independent that they don't even pronounce some words the same and have their own units of measurement.
2015-11-16 20:40:25	@Espyo	Alumínio in Portuguese
2015-11-16 20:41:04	Yoyo	Why are we still talking about this?

2015-11-16 20:45:46	@PikFan	and 10 day run has a todo on it
2015-11-16 20:46:13	@PikFan	and Mireclops feels too spoilery to be an FA
2015-11-16 20:47:15	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-11-16 20:47:22	@Espyo	well, we have to fix 10 day run

2015-11-16 20:47:31	@Espyo	at most, people will learn it's a boss
2015-11-16 20:47:42	@Espyo	not really much of a spoiler in knowing that there are bosses in Pikmin 3
2015-11-16 20:47:56	@PikFan	er, well, it's spoilery because Louie
2015-11-16 20:48:06	Yoyo	What are the conditions of the 10 day run?
2015-11-16 20:48:21	@Espyo	hmm
2015-11-16 20:48:34	@Espyo	well, complete the game in 10 days
2015-11-16 20:48:37	@Espyo	nothing else really
2015-11-16 20:48:48	@PikFan	get all fruit in 10 days, he means
2015-11-16 20:48:54	@Espyo	right, that
2015-11-16 20:49:31	Yoyo	This should be interesting.
2015-11-16 20:49:44	@PikFan	last night I tried searching for a potential new FA...
2015-11-16 20:50:00	@PikFan	I thought 100 Pikmin limit would be interesting, but it's got a giant todo on it
2015-11-16 20:50:14	@Espyo	yikes, yeah

2015-11-16 21:03:10	@Espyo	somebody made a video recently
2015-11-16 21:03:22	Yoshi2	why exactly 46?
2015-11-16 21:03:58	@Espyo	lowest possible amount
2015-11-16 21:04:03	@Espyo	but I thought 42 was the lowest, not 46
2015-11-16 21:04:08	@Espyo	oh, also, it's the lowest number of births
2015-11-16 21:04:13	@Espyo	so changing colors with Candypop Buds is allowed
2015-11-16 21:08:10	Yoyo	Candypop buds doesn't technically count as birthing. Unless violet and ivory ones count as creating Pikmin.
2015-11-16 21:08:56	Yoyo	But you can't 46 100 percent Pikmin 2.
2015-11-16 21:09:38	@Espyo	oh, I was thinking 42 for Pikmin 3

2015-11-16 23:12:05	Scruffy	That'd reveal Winged Pikmin too quickly
2015-11-16 23:12:11	@PikFan	I agree
2015-11-16 23:12:28	@PikFan	something to do with fire, definitely

2015-11-17 00:00:31	Scruffy	So, I encountered a compositor error in my animation, so I had to go back a few frames and redo it
2015-11-17 00:00:40	@PikFan	that sucks
2015-11-17 00:00:44	Scruffy	So I'm back to about halfway done with it
2015-11-17 00:00:48	Scruffy	It's no big deal
2015-11-17 00:00:57	Scruffy	It actually helped more than I though

2015-11-17 00:01:10	@PikFan	how so?
2015-11-17 00:01:28	Scruffy	While I was correcting it I noticed an animation error I had made, so I was able to fix that as well
2015-11-17 00:01:44	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-17 00:01:59	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 00:02:13	Scruffy	Oh, wait, do you know what the compositor is?

2015-11-17 00:02:32	Scruffy	Ah, sorry, I hadn't explained
2015-11-17 00:02:36	@PikFan	wait
2015-11-17 00:02:45	@PikFan	is it the thing that renders everything?
2015-11-17 00:02:54	Scruffy	not quite
2015-11-17 00:03:07	Scruffy	After the render is done, the compositor applies after-effects
2015-11-17 00:03:15	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-11-17 00:03:21	Scruffy	Like glare, lensflares, depth of field
2015-11-17 00:03:22	@PikFan	so... it's like post-production
2015-11-17 00:03:25	Scruffy	It's super-fun
2015-11-17 00:03:38	Scruffy	But in an animation it has to calculate that per frame
2015-11-17 00:03:48	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-17 00:03:55	Scruffy	I have a simple fog glow on this so that especially bright things look more glowy

2015-11-17 00:04:20	Scruffy	So the glow showed up behind the objects

2015-11-17 00:24:57	Scruffy	My understanding is that eventually they want to organize Pikmin Fanon content on there

2015-11-17 00:27:45	@PikFan	now I'd be drawing from three websites
2015-11-17 00:27:50	Scruffy	Same
2015-11-17 00:27:59	Scruffy	It's another outlet for me to take requests
2015-11-17 00:28:04	@PikFan	exactly
2015-11-17 00:28:11	Scruffy	I rendered the Sudoric Bulblax in the enemies section
2015-11-17 00:28:21	@PikFan	...even if the forums have, more or less, the same users as the wikis
2015-11-17 00:28:36	@PikFan	but they're purely for socializing, so...
2015-11-17 00:28:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 00:28:56	Scruffy	It's good for creations like art or music, easily shareable
2015-11-17 00:29:12	Scruffy	For fangames, Fanon is better suited all around
2015-11-17 00:29:26	Scruffy	And Fanon is still easily sharable
2015-11-17 00:29:31	Scruffy	shareable
2015-11-17 00:29:49	Scruffy	But it's definitely for socializing
2015-11-17 00:30:11	Scruffy	Right now there's an argument going on about why Pikmin could/should or couldn't/shouldn't have a night mode
2015-11-17 00:30:18	@PikFan	ooh
2015-11-17 00:30:23	@PikFan	I think it should
2015-11-17 00:30:30	@PikFan	but you'd have to earn it first
2015-11-17 00:30:48	@PikFan	in PCW, you have to be at an area for at least 5 days before you can explore it at night
2015-11-17 00:31:03	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 00:31:33	@PikFan	J said something a long time ago that the reason why they have sunset is that people don't stay in an area forever
2015-11-17 00:31:36	@PikFan	and it makes sense
2015-11-17 00:31:48	Scruffy	Others argue that Pikmin is all about managing time during the day
2015-11-17 00:31:55	Scruffy	And that time at night removes that
2015-11-17 00:31:56	Scruffy	EYah
2015-11-17 00:32:04	Scruffy	Yeah*
2015-11-17 00:32:28	@PikFan	"EYah" seemed like a sound of disapproval, heh
2015-11-17 00:32:34	Scruffy	Hehe
2015-11-17 00:32:51	Scruffy	If anything, I think an optional day extension is fine for me
2015-11-17 00:32:57	Scruffy	As long as enemies get harder
2015-11-17 00:33:00	@PikFan	I agree
2015-11-17 00:33:02	Scruffy	Not more numerous, but harder
2015-11-17 00:33:03	@PikFan	yeah, that too
2015-11-17 00:33:17	@PikFan	well, they can be more numerous, but not overly so, I think
2015-11-17 00:33:21	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 00:33:37	Scruffy	And I like your idea of eating up some of the next day if one day is extended
2015-11-17 00:33:42	Scruffy	So the leaders can rest
2015-11-17 00:33:59	Scruffy	It can trigger a chain of extended nights and delayed mornings
2015-11-17 00:34:04	@PikFan	truth be told, it's not an original idea...
2015-11-17 00:34:12	@PikFan	I saw it on a YouTube video ages ago
2015-11-17 00:34:21	@PikFan	like in 2008 or 2009
2015-11-17 00:34:23	Scruffy	Maybe that would grog down the leaders, since their circadian rhythm would be disrupted
2015-11-17 00:35:08	@PikFan	but it doesn't really matter now, since it's 6-7 years later
2015-11-17 00:35:09	@PikFan	and yeah
2015-11-17 00:35:12	Scruffy	Yeh
2015-11-17 00:35:39	@PikFan	hmm, to counter that, maybe you couldn't stay the night two times in a row
2015-11-17 00:35:54	@PikFan	only every other day, possibly
2015-11-17 00:35:58	@PikFan	...or night
2015-11-17 00:35:59	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-17 00:36:08	Scruffy	Heh
2015-11-17 00:37:21	@PikFan	brb, I need to boot up Pikmin 2 real quick
2015-11-17 00:38:25	Scruffy	Yay
2015-11-17 00:38:40	Scruffy	I would, but it can't run on my computer while Blender's working
2015-11-17 00:38:45	Scruffy	Not smoothly, anyway
2015-11-17 00:52:20	Scruffy	What's your favorite track off of P2?
2015-11-17 00:53:26	@PikFan	back
2015-11-17 00:53:34	@PikFan	hmm, I'd have to think about it
2015-11-17 00:53:56	Scruffy	Yeah it's no small question
2015-11-17 00:53:58	Scruffy	well
2015-11-17 00:54:09	Scruffy	Your favorites?
2015-11-17 00:54:26	Scruffy	Valley of Repose theme is in there for me
2015-11-17 00:54:28	@PikFan	the Perplexing Pool theme while carrying a treasure
2015-11-17 00:54:32	@PikFan	it feels so... tropical
2015-11-17 00:54:38	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2015-11-17 00:54:50	Scruffy	It's the steel drum and bass rhythm that does it
2015-11-17 00:54:55	@PikFan	also, Shower Room main theme when carrying a treasure
2015-11-17 00:54:59	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 00:55:12	Scruffy	I actually really enjoy the Submerged Castle theme
2015-11-17 00:55:15	@PikFan	basically, any theme while carrying a treasure
2015-11-17 00:55:19	@PikFan	it sure is ominous
2015-11-17 00:55:22	Scruffy	It's harmonies are off-putting and interesting
2015-11-17 00:55:45	Scruffy	And also the boss battle theme is still super-engaging for me
2015-11-17 00:55:54	Scruffy	More so than P3's main boss theme
2015-11-17 00:56:14	@PikFan	on the topic of music, did you ever get a chance to record the Cavern of Chaos sublevel 1's theme?
2015-11-17 00:56:27	@PikFan	we had a big discussion that it was different from Metal 3
2015-11-17 00:57:03	@PikFan	because in the Cavern of Chaos, it doesn't have those funky high-pitched notes
2015-11-17 00:57:09	@PikFan	like in the regular Metal 3
2015-11-17 00:57:21	Scruffy	Shoot, I'm not at the Wistful Wild in my P2 emulator
2015-11-17 00:57:26	Scruffy	Hang on
2015-11-17 00:57:29	@PikFan	that's what I was trying to convey, but I didn't word it very well
2015-11-17 00:57:30	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-17 00:58:23	Scruffy	I think
2015-11-17 00:58:28	Scruffy	It's just Metal 3
2015-11-17 00:58:52	@PikFan	that can't be right
2015-11-17 00:58:57	@PikFan	well, it is
2015-11-17 00:59:14	@PikFan	but I mean, I KNOW I hear slight variations between Cavern of Chaos and Snagret Hole
2015-11-17 00:59:33	Scruffy	I've only got Youtube videos to go off of at the moment
2015-11-17 00:59:36	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-17 00:59:37	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-17 00:59:44	Scruffy	I've gotta crack down and get to the Cavern of Chaos
2015-11-17 00:59:53	@PikFan	you could also go to Subterranean Complex sublevel 6
2015-11-17 01:00:10	@PikFan	same theme as CoC 1
2015-11-17 01:01:16	Scruffy	Let me try t
2015-11-17 01:01:19	Scruffy	it*
2015-11-17 01:01:21	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-17 01:01:22	Scruffy	Hang on a sec
2015-11-17 01:01:37	@PikFan	'kay
2015-11-17 01:01:39	@PikFan	brb
2015-11-17 01:01:39	Scruffy	Oh, also, I'm really happy the community has gone with my method of naming cave music
2015-11-17 01:01:50	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-11-17 01:01:53	Scruffy	Even though I entirely made it up :P
2015-11-17 01:01:56	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 01:02:03	@PikFan	okay, actual brb this time
2015-11-17 01:02:07	Scruffy	k
2015-11-17 01:03:45	@PikFan	back
2015-11-17 01:03:50	@PikFan	had to double check
2015-11-17 01:04:12	Scruffy	Oh!
2015-11-17 01:04:19	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-11-17 01:04:27	Scruffy	Double check?
2015-11-17 01:04:35	@PikFan	double check my stats
2015-11-17 01:04:45	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-17 01:05:03	@PikFan	anyway, what are you saying "Oh!" for?
2015-11-17 01:05:27	Scruffy	I thought you had double checked the music, and i was like "That was fast
2015-11-17 01:05:38	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-11-17 01:06:39	Scruffy	Ok, subterranean complex sublevel 6, and then Snagret Hole sublevel 5?
2015-11-17 01:06:45	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-17 01:06:50	Scruffy	I'm on it
2015-11-17 01:06:58	@PikFan	Snagret Hole 5 is the regular Metal 3
2015-11-17 01:07:08	Scruffy	Ah ok
2015-11-17 01:07:14	@PikFan	Subterranean Complex is the weird one
2015-11-17 01:07:22	Scruffy	gotcha
2015-11-17 01:07:27	Scruffy	If it's any different
2015-11-17 01:07:35	Scruffy	My ears will be very attentive
2015-11-17 01:07:38	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-17 01:07:47	Scruffy	I have to go, I'll be back on when I finish
2015-11-17 01:07:57	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-17 01:07:57	Scruffy	Otherwise the game lags a lot
2015-11-17 01:08:06	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-17 01:08:18	@PikFan	well, good luck, I hope you find the differences
2015-11-17 01:08:18	Scruffy	See ya in about half an hour or less
2015-11-17 01:08:23	@PikFan	bye

2015-11-17 01:41:08	Scruffy	Hello
2015-11-17 01:41:10	@PikFan	welcome back
2015-11-17 01:41:10	Scruffy	YOU
2015-11-17 01:41:12	Scruffy	WERE
2015-11-17 01:41:13	Scruffy	RIGHT
2015-11-17 01:41:20	@PikFan	yay
2015-11-17 01:41:24	Scruffy	There is a difference
2015-11-17 01:41:29	@PikFan	I knew it
2015-11-17 01:41:34	@PikFan	I'm not insane
2015-11-17 01:41:42	@PikFan	I knew I heard different notes
2015-11-17 01:41:48	Scruffy	And you said Subterranean Complex was the odd one out, right?
2015-11-17 01:41:55	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-17 01:42:01	Scruffy	Now I know why
2015-11-17 01:42:08	Scruffy	No instruments are different
2015-11-17 01:42:20	Scruffy	There are just a few different gestures in the meldoy
2015-11-17 01:42:22	Scruffy	melody
2015-11-17 01:42:26	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-17 01:42:30	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-17 01:43:01	Scruffy	The normal theme uses the atonal series Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F
2015-11-17 01:43:38	Scruffy	The Subterranean Complex Sublevel 6 uses Ab, A, Bb, B, Db, D, Eb, and G!
2015-11-17 01:44:03	@PikFan	I'm just glad we got this settled for once and for all
2015-11-17 01:44:17	@PikFan	it's been bothering me ever since you made Music in Pikmin 2
2015-11-17 01:44:20	@PikFan	...well, no
2015-11-17 01:44:22	@PikFan	before that
2015-11-17 01:44:36	@PikFan	but creating it renewed my concerns
2015-11-17 01:44:50	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-17 01:45:01	Scruffy	Well I'm sorry it hasn't been resolved for you until now
2015-11-17 01:45:08	Scruffy	I'm ashamed I hadn't picked up on that
2015-11-17 01:45:20	@PikFan	no, no, it's my fault for not reminding you earlier
2015-11-17 01:45:33	@PikFan	but anyway... ahhhhhhh
2015-11-17 01:45:35	@PikFan	finally
2015-11-17 01:46:21	Scruffy	It's such a small difference, I have no idea why it would be there
2015-11-17 01:46:39	@PikFan	no idea
2015-11-17 01:46:46	@PikFan	who knows why the devs did that
2015-11-17 01:46:53	@PikFan	isn't it a different file altogether?
2015-11-17 01:47:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 01:47:18	Scruffy	Same name, different number
2015-11-17 01:47:36	@PikFan	guh
2015-11-17 01:47:41	@PikFan	Pikmin 2 is so weird
2015-11-17 01:48:40	Scruffy	Haha I saw your icon on the forums
2015-11-17 01:48:50	@PikFan	do you like it?
2015-11-17 01:49:49	Scruffy	Yes, thank you for using it
2015-11-17 01:49:58	@PikFan	sure, no problem
2015-11-17 01:50:07	@PikFan	it's especially cool because of the background
2015-11-17 01:50:12	@PikFan	IT'S A PIKMIN IN SPACE
2015-11-17 01:50:15	Scruffy	Hehe
2015-11-17 01:50:43	--	Pi is now known as SLPi
2015-11-17 01:51:01	@PikFan	and wow, your intro post has way more views and replies than all the other posts
2015-11-17 01:51:40	Scruffy	Woah really?
2015-11-17 01:51:44	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 01:51:53	@PikFan	yours has 267 views
2015-11-17 01:52:04	Scruffy	wow
2015-11-17 01:52:04	@PikFan	the next highest has 46
2015-11-17 01:52:11	Scruffy	I didn't know I was such a celebrity
2015-11-17 01:52:25	@PikFan	people love your renders, Scruffy
2015-11-17 01:52:46	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 01:52:48	Scruffy	Thank you
2015-11-17 01:53:10	@PikFan	by the way, not to be demanding, or anything...
2015-11-17 01:53:28	@PikFan	but have you gotten a chance to work on the Torrid Desert preview lately...?
2015-11-17 01:53:31	Scruffy	But you're waiting on your Torrid Desert preview?
2015-11-17 01:53:35	Scruffy	Yeah, I'm soryr
2015-11-17 01:53:47	Scruffy	what with the concert I've been lagging behind on requests
2015-11-17 01:53:54	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-17 01:54:03	@PikFan	it's no trouble, I'm just checking in
2015-11-17 01:54:12	Scruffy	But now that it's over I can get back into it
2015-11-17 01:54:16	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-17 01:54:21	@PikFan	are things less busy now?
2015-11-17 01:54:25	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-17 01:54:28	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-17 01:54:29	Scruffy	Fortunately
2015-11-17 01:55:09	@PikFan	hmm, I gotta start the overhaul soon
2015-11-17 01:55:12	@PikFan	for PCW
2015-11-17 01:55:17	Scruffy	Oooh yeah
2015-11-17 01:55:30	@PikFan	just... I'm not sure what to do about those caves
2015-11-17 01:55:38	@PikFan	blergh
2015-11-17 01:55:42	Scruffy	Heh I have this folder just labels "Requests" in my Pikmin folder (I have a Pikmin folder)
2015-11-17 01:55:44	@PikFan	really, I'm being lazy
2015-11-17 01:55:51	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-17 01:56:10	Scruffy	I've gotta have some way to organize this stuff
2015-11-17 01:56:17	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 01:56:31	@PikFan	I keep my stuff on Google Docs, that way I can edit them anywhere
2015-11-17 01:56:36	Scruffy	And it's really cool to just cycle through all these community ideas
2015-11-17 01:56:40	Scruffy	Oh, yeah, that's a good idea
2015-11-17 01:57:18	@PikFan	I used to write my stories on Google Docs, but now that I have an account on fanfiction.net, I don't need to
2015-11-17 01:57:31	@PikFan	I still write my other things on there, though
2015-11-17 01:57:40	@PikFan	it's pretty convenient
2015-11-17 01:58:19	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 01:58:31	Scruffy	Especially if you're working in a group, anyone can just make edits
2015-11-17 01:58:38	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-17 01:58:46	@PikFan	oh, that reminds me
2015-11-17 01:58:58	@PikFan	there's this great big todo list for Pikipedia on Docs
2015-11-17 02:00:58	Scruffy	Ooh
2015-11-17 02:01:08	Scruffy	is anyone allowed to see it?
2015-11-17 02:01:11	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 02:01:18	@PikFan	I gotta find it first

2015-11-17 02:05:32	Scruffy	Woah
2015-11-17 02:05:34	Scruffy	This is neat
2015-11-17 02:19:24	Scruffy	This is really cool
2015-11-17 02:19:29	Scruffy	Makes me want to start them
2015-11-17 02:19:32	@PikFan	okay, just posted on the night mode argument thing
2015-11-17 02:19:44	@PikFan	wait, did you read through the whole thing?
2015-11-17 02:21:44	Scruffy	I'm halfway through
2015-11-17 02:21:49	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-17 02:31:17	Scruffy	I'm gonna update Metal 3
2015-11-17 02:31:23	@PikFan	sweet
2015-11-17 02:34:36	@PikFan	erm... moving?
2015-11-17 02:35:13	@PikFan	in the latest Pikcast, somebody says that Pikmin Fanon's users are going to move to the Pikmin forums...???
2015-11-17 02:35:42	@PikFan	like, sure, Pikmin Fanon is very low quality, no doubt about that
2015-11-17 02:36:12	@PikFan	but I also feel that a wiki has much more options for displaying things than just a forum
2015-11-17 02:36:21	@PikFan	I'm not saying the forums are bad
2015-11-17 02:36:44	@PikFan	just... they're limited
2015-11-17 02:36:57	@PikFan	they don't really have all the neat tools that wikis do
2015-11-17 02:37:44	@PikFan	I dunno, it just hits a nerve when somebody says "Oh, you're going to move to such and such place, and you have no choice!"
2015-11-17 02:38:00	@PikFan	that's how the thing in the Pikcast came off, anyway
2015-11-17 02:38:32	@PikFan	I honestly feel like that the Pikmin Wikia folk dislike Pikmin Fanon
2015-11-17 02:38:33	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 02:39:01	Scruffy	I feel like the Pikmin Wikia folk dislike both Pikmin Mediawikis
2015-11-17 02:39:23	@PikFan	I think they're find with Pikipedia
2015-11-17 02:39:30	@PikFan	but they don't like Pikmin Fanon
2015-11-17 02:39:52	@PikFan	I don't blame them, there are some pretty terrible things on there
2015-11-17 02:40:04	@PikFan	but that doesn't mean that you should force all users to abandon it
2015-11-17 02:40:45	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-17 02:40:51	@PikFan	also, I'm taking this personally, since I've been on Fanon for nearly 5 years now
2015-11-17 02:40:53	Scruffy	Those users should have a say
2015-11-17 02:40:54	@PikFan	...5 years
2015-11-17 02:40:55	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-17 02:41:37	Scruffy	That's quite a while
2015-11-17 02:41:44	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-17 02:42:55	Scruffy	You're watching the Pikcast now?
2015-11-17 02:42:59	@PikFan	yes
2015-11-17 02:43:40	@PikFan	I don't like it when people who don't even edit Pikmin Fanon say that we're going to leave
2015-11-17 02:43:44	@PikFan	I don't like that at all
2015-11-17 02:43:49	@PikFan	I'm going to talk to Espyo about this
2015-11-17 02:43:59	@PikFan	perhaps I'm being a bit defensive, sure
2015-11-17 02:44:45	Scruffy	No no I think you're justified
2015-11-17 02:45:02	Scruffy	I like Pikmin Fanon's intentions with organization
2015-11-17 02:45:13	Scruffy	They make more sense when people want to create games
2015-11-17 02:45:46	@PikFan	he did say that it needs better managment
2015-11-17 02:45:50	@PikFan	*management
2015-11-17 02:45:54	@PikFan	and I agree completely
2015-11-17 02:46:11	@PikFan	I'm not really up to the task of cleaning an entire wiki
2015-11-17 02:46:22	@PikFan	that's kinda beyond a teenager like me
2015-11-17 02:46:26	@PikFan	or anyone, really
2015-11-17 02:46:26	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-17 02:46:39	Scruffy	What to do with those really short articles
2015-11-17 02:46:43	Scruffy	Delete them?
2015-11-17 02:46:52	@PikFan	ideally, yes
2015-11-17 02:46:53	Scruffy	They're still intellectual property
2015-11-17 02:46:54	@PikFan	but...
2015-11-17 02:46:57	@PikFan	right, right
2015-11-17 02:46:59	@PikFan	that's the problem
2015-11-17 02:47:31	@PikFan	if a person comes back after a long time only to see that their content has been deleted, they'd probably be quite upset
2015-11-17 02:47:50	@PikFan	and unfortunately, over 90% of all users are gone
2015-11-17 02:48:20	@PikFan	so in essence, I'd be deleting a big part of the wiki
2015-11-17 02:48:38	@PikFan	hmm, maybe I should talk to Porple, the domain owner
2015-11-17 02:48:49	@PikFan	I know that he gave Espyo traffic stats for Pikipedia
2015-11-17 02:48:54	@PikFan	maybe he can give them to me
2015-11-17 02:49:09	@PikFan	that way, I can go through and delete the least popular pages
2015-11-17 02:49:15	Scruffy	yeah
2015-11-17 02:49:59	@PikFan	also, we'd have to come up with a clear definition of "stub"
2015-11-17 02:50:03	@PikFan	*we
2015-11-17 02:50:18	@PikFan	I read on Fantendo that articles less than 500 bytes are discouraged
2015-11-17 02:50:41	Scruffy	Ah
2015-11-17 02:50:51	Scruffy	That sounds reasonable
2015-11-17 02:51:46	@PikFan	hmm, according to this, the first thousand pages are over 1,500 bytes, so that's good http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Special:LongPages&limit=500&offset=500
2015-11-17 02:52:07	@PikFan	oh, there's also Special:ShortPages
2015-11-17 02:52:08	@PikFan	neat
2015-11-17 02:53:33	@PikFan	okay, so there's 734 pages that are less than 500 bytes
2015-11-17 02:53:35	@PikFan	also, brb
2015-11-17 02:53:43	Scruffy	ok

2015-11-17 02:59:39	Scruffy	Hi
2015-11-17 02:59:50	Scruffy	Man, I write long articles
2015-11-17 02:59:58	Scruffy	Pikmin Forever is right behind PCW
2015-11-17 03:00:09	Scruffy	And Music in Pikmin 2 is the largest article on Pikipedia
2015-11-17 03:00:35	Scruffy	at 115,083
2015-11-17 03:00:41	@PikFan	heh
2015-11-17 03:00:42	Scruffy	Something's wrong with me
2015-11-17 03:00:47	@PikFan	no, no
2015-11-17 03:00:52	@PikFan	details are great
2015-11-17 03:00:59	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 03:01:26	@PikFan	actually, if I detailed the whole story of PCW on its page, it'd probably be a lot longer
2015-11-17 03:01:51	@PikFan	and that's not even including alternate gameplay modes
2015-11-17 03:01:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 03:02:07	@PikFan	lots of it is still incomplete, yet it's the second longest game on the wiki
2015-11-17 03:02:21	@PikFan	...I am very wordy
2015-11-17 03:03:00	@PikFan	19:00	Scruffy	Something's wrong with me
2015-11-17 03:03:02	@PikFan	well, no
2015-11-17 03:03:11	@PikFan	something's wrong with the music of Pikmin 2
2015-11-17 03:03:16	@PikFan	for having so
2015-11-17 03:03:17	@PikFan	many
2015-11-17 03:03:18	@PikFan	variants
2015-11-17 03:03:26	Scruffy	Yeah

2015-11-17 03:30:30	@PikFan	I also copy/pasted my PCW overhaul thing on the forums
2015-11-17 03:30:44	@PikFan	you and En Passant are the only ones giving me advice so far
2015-11-17 03:30:56	@PikFan	and I like it, but I need more
2015-11-17 03:31:12	Scruffy	Ah, I see
2015-11-17 03:31:22	@PikFan	I need more input, I mean
2015-11-17 03:31:35	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 03:31:51	Scruffy	I had an idea that caves didn't have to be all underground
2015-11-17 03:32:09	@PikFan	oh, really?
2015-11-17 03:32:13	Scruffy	Pikmin 3 introduced light majorly coming in from the ceilings of caves
2015-11-17 03:32:23	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-11-17 03:32:35	Scruffy	Or the cave being a big stump or mound with an eroded hole on top
2015-11-17 03:32:47	Scruffy	So that natural light comes in, it feels more outdoorsy
2015-11-17 03:32:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 03:33:54	Scruffy	Is the Arachlord still the final boss?

2015-11-17 03:34:14	@PikFan	probably
2015-11-17 03:34:33	@PikFan	the regular final boss is a robot
2015-11-17 03:34:37	Scruffy	Right
2015-11-17 03:34:53	Scruffy	Hey, maybe we should work on the plot
2015-11-17 03:34:57	Scruffy	Now, or soon
2015-11-17 03:35:07	@PikFan	alright
2015-11-17 03:35:16	Scruffy	So that you'll have a good idea if a particular area or part of an area fits in with the story
2015-11-17 03:35:21	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 03:35:28	Scruffy	Do you still want the objective to be to capture Asfer?
2015-11-17 03:35:39	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 03:35:54	@PikFan	stopping him, at the very least
2015-11-17 03:36:11	@PikFan	because he's doing all this to overthrow the government
2015-11-17 03:37:00	@PikFan	hey, maybe he's upset for the same reason Louie is in your story
2015-11-17 03:37:02	@PikFan	poverty
2015-11-17 03:37:23	Scruffy	Oh, Louie isn't upset because he was born into poverty
2015-11-17 03:37:29	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-17 03:37:35	Scruffy	He's upset that he was left twice on PNF-404
2015-11-17 03:37:43	Scruffy	But conflicted as to whether it's his own fault
2015-11-17 03:37:51	@PikFan	but wasn't he also upset at Hocotate Freight?
2015-11-17 03:38:23	Scruffy	He blames Hocotate Freight for everything that's happened to him
2015-11-17 03:38:32	Scruffy	And generally didn't want to live on Hocotate in the first place
2015-11-17 03:38:47	Scruffy	Initially, that is
2015-11-17 03:39:07	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-17 03:39:09	Scruffy	Once he gets to spending so much time with Olimar, and the Titan Dweevil, his opinions might change a little
2015-11-17 03:40:01	@PikFan	well, Asfer's a bit different then, but we could say that the government had caused Hocotate to plunge into a deep economic depression
2015-11-17 03:40:06	@PikFan	and so, he's upset
2015-11-17 03:40:12	@PikFan	he wants to fix things
2015-11-17 03:40:27	@PikFan	but his ideals are corrupted, too
2015-11-17 03:40:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 03:40:40	@PikFan	it's all cliche, yeah, but...
2015-11-17 03:40:49	Scruffy	Neat! Our stories have a common event
2015-11-17 03:40:56	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 03:41:01	Scruffy	It could be a stock market crash
2015-11-17 03:41:05	@PikFan	sure, sure
2015-11-17 03:41:16	@PikFan	I mean, I like the idea, but it feels cliche
2015-11-17 03:41:23	@PikFan	at the same time, though, it also feels nice
2015-11-17 03:41:42	@PikFan	it's a huge theme
2015-11-17 03:41:55	@PikFan	the villain wants to do something good but has a bad means of doing it
2015-11-17 03:42:14	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 03:42:33	@PikFan	meh, I'll just accept it
2015-11-17 03:42:35	Scruffy	Although, in my story I'm saying this happens before the events of Pikmin 1
2015-11-17 03:42:42	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 03:43:07	Scruffy	And you say this one comes after Pikmin 2
2015-11-17 03:43:13	Scruffy	So...
2015-11-17 03:43:33	@PikFan	I mean, he's been plotting this out for years
2015-11-17 03:43:39	Scruffy	Maybe Asfer wants to improve the economy, and doesn't think Hocotate Freight is doing a good job of it for years>
2015-11-17 03:43:49	@PikFan	but with the discovery of the planet, it's the perfect opportunity
2015-11-17 03:44:16	@PikFan	use its resources, grow a rebellion, oust the old government, restore the economy...
2015-11-17 03:44:16	Scruffy	But Hocotate snags it before Asfer can do anything
2015-11-17 03:44:28	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 03:44:36	Scruffy	He had to wait till they lefy
2015-11-17 03:44:38	Scruffy	left*
2015-11-17 03:44:43	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 03:44:55	Scruffy	By grow a rebellion, do you mean with Pikmin?
2015-11-17 03:45:00	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-17 03:45:13	@PikFan	okay, start a rebellion
2015-11-17 03:45:34	Scruffy	No no I mean would he use Pikmin to start a rebellion?
2015-11-17 03:45:43	@PikFan	oh, you were being serious...
2015-11-17 03:45:44	Scruffy	It seems logical but a little impractical
2015-11-17 03:45:46	@PikFan	no
2015-11-17 03:45:52	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 03:45:53	Scruffy	Ok
2015-11-17 03:46:07	@PikFan	though, I'm thinking he creates robots based off Pikmin
2015-11-17 03:46:11	Scruffy	Otherwise it doesn't seem like Asfer has much to work with
2015-11-17 03:46:22	Scruffy	Unless he has like an underground society
2015-11-17 03:46:31	Scruffy	Of other oppressed angry Hocotatians
2015-11-17 03:46:44	@PikFan	that's what I'm thinking
2015-11-17 03:46:54	@PikFan	sorry, I gotta brb for like 10 minutes
2015-11-17 03:47:05	Scruffy	no problem
2015-11-17 03:59:16	@PikFan	back
2015-11-17 03:59:28	@PikFan	okay, so this is what I'm thinking
2015-11-17 03:59:35	Scruffy	Hi
2015-11-17 03:59:43	@PikFan	Asfer is initially portrayed as a rebel, plotting to take over the government
2015-11-17 04:00:04	@PikFan	but over the course of the game, it's revealed that he just wants economic equality for everyone
2015-11-17 04:00:14	@PikFan	and this causes Olimar to doubt things
2015-11-17 04:00:19	Scruffy	Yes yes yes
2015-11-17 04:00:25	@PikFan	nevertheless, they follow through and capture him
2015-11-17 04:00:40	@PikFan	but Olimar isn't sure if they did the right thing by capturing Asfer
2015-11-17 04:01:34	@PikFan	what they don't know is that Asfer successfully played into the people's feelings, and a rebellion begins
2015-11-17 04:01:52	@PikFan	unfortunately, at the same time, an ecological crisis occurs on the planet
2015-11-17 04:02:12	@PikFan	and, since the government is busy fighting the rebels, they can't help solve the ecological crisis
2015-11-17 04:02:22	@PikFan	this is the premise of the next game
2015-11-17 04:02:53	Scruffy	woah woah which planet has the ecological crisis
2015-11-17 04:03:02	@PikFan	PNF-404
2015-11-17 04:03:15	Scruffy	Some sort of natural disaster?
2015-11-17 04:03:19	@PikFan	caused by Asfer's exploitation of the resources
2015-11-17 04:03:34	Scruffy	Which he hadn't foreseen
2015-11-17 04:03:39	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 04:03:43	@PikFan	well, not exactly
2015-11-17 04:04:05	@PikFan	see, he was so bent on accomplishing his goals he really had no regard for the native wildlife
2015-11-17 04:04:51	Scruffy	And for that Olimar can justify his actions, since he has a connection with the Pikmin
2015-11-17 04:05:01	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-17 04:05:06	Scruffy	A connection of the worlds!!!
2015-11-17 04:05:11	@PikFan	:D
2015-11-17 04:05:20	Scruffy	i like it
2015-11-17 04:05:22	Scruffy	a lot
2015-11-17 04:05:35	Scruffy	ending the story on a cliffhanger, I hadn't thought of that before
2015-11-17 04:05:46	@PikFan	okay, so I'm not sure how the ecological crisis will manifest itself, though
2015-11-17 04:06:03	Scruffy	True
2015-11-17 04:06:06	@PikFan	because originally it was going to be that asteroid or whatever, but you helped me to realize that was impractical
2015-11-17 04:06:12	@PikFan	too much energy
2015-11-17 04:06:16	Scruffy	Asfer wouldn't use so many resources that a volcano erupts or something
2015-11-17 04:06:26	@PikFan	hah, no
2015-11-17 04:06:30	Scruffy	And then it was going to be chrons, right?
2015-11-17 04:06:41	@PikFan	well, that was End of Time
2015-11-17 04:06:52	@PikFan	End of Time isn't related to PCW at all
2015-11-17 04:07:18	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-17 04:07:22	Scruffy	Shoot
2015-11-17 04:07:29	@PikFan	wait, I've got it
2015-11-17 04:07:41	@PikFan	okay, so we've seen some pretty crazy wildlife on the planet
2015-11-17 04:07:49	@PikFan	like the Plasm Wraith, for instance
2015-11-17 04:08:22	@PikFan	what if other creatures were outraged and started rampaging across the planet?
2015-11-17 04:08:35	@PikFan	that could be the crisis
2015-11-17 04:08:54	@PikFan	so you'd have to somehow quell these creatures
2015-11-17 04:09:19	Scruffy	woah
2015-11-17 04:09:35	Scruffy	Some creature so powerful that it getting angry would be a crisis?
2015-11-17 04:09:45	@PikFan	or creatures, but yeah
2015-11-17 04:09:59	Scruffy	Like maybe a huge swarm of little creature
2015-11-17 04:10:01	Scruffy	s*
2015-11-17 04:10:07	@PikFan	possibly
2015-11-17 04:10:11	@PikFan	I'm not too sure
2015-11-17 04:11:45	Scruffy	hm
2015-11-17 04:13:57	Scruffy	Perhaps he doesn't put the whole planet in danger
2015-11-17 04:14:01	Scruffy	but just the Pikmin
2015-11-17 04:14:21	@PikFan	increased violence against the monsters?
2015-11-17 04:14:27	@PikFan	*against the Pikmin
2015-11-17 04:14:29	@PikFan	derp
2015-11-17 04:15:05	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 04:15:26	Scruffy	Perhaps he angers a creature or event that endangers Pikmin
2015-11-17 04:15:31	Scruffy	like pollution
2015-11-17 04:15:40	Scruffy	or something worse than the plasm wraith
2015-11-17 04:15:46	@PikFan	oh dear
2015-11-17 04:15:52	@PikFan	how scary
2015-11-17 04:15:55	@PikFan	...I like it
2015-11-17 04:16:16	@PikFan	but what could be scarier than the Plasm Wraith?
2015-11-17 04:17:02	Scruffy	I don't know
2015-11-17 04:17:19	Scruffy	Well, the Mysterious Life-form was scarier for me than the Plasm Wraith
2015-11-17 04:17:26	Scruffy	And then the Waterwraith scariest of all
2015-11-17 04:17:37	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-17 04:17:52	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-17 04:18:20	@PikFan	well, we should be talking about PCW, we kinda lost foucs
2015-11-17 04:18:22	@PikFan	&focus
2015-11-17 04:18:24	@PikFan	**focus
2015-11-17 04:18:24	Scruffy	but basically if you have a "Wraith" in a Pikmin game, it means it's invincible, and can only be incapacitated temporarily by Pikmin
2015-11-17 04:18:33	Scruffy	true
2015-11-17 04:18:40	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-11-17 04:18:55	Scruffy	although, we still sort of are talking about the ending to it, and its transition into the next game
2015-11-17 04:19:03	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 04:20:02	Scruffy	Well, at least we have some interesting waypoints in the story
2015-11-17 04:20:13	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-17 04:20:15	Scruffy	Asfer starts off as a criminal for the first few areas
2015-11-17 04:20:24	Scruffy	He doesn't seem as bad after a while
2015-11-17 04:20:29	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 04:20:40	@PikFan	it's a basic skeleton
2015-11-17 04:20:40	Scruffy	Olimar starts to regret, perhaps after a particularly challenging boss
2015-11-17 04:20:44	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 04:21:10	@PikFan	that adds into the inner tension, like how you suggested with MW
2015-11-17 04:21:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 04:21:45	Scruffy	People love that inner tension
2015-11-17 04:21:47	@PikFan	it's kinda like Hunger Games, where one of the characters says something like "Who's the real enemy here?"
2015-11-17 04:21:54	Scruffy	Right right
2015-11-17 04:22:01	@PikFan	I forgot which character said that
2015-11-17 04:22:03	@PikFan	but yeah
2015-11-17 04:22:23	Scruffy	It happens all over literature and media
2015-11-17 04:22:28	Scruffy	it's probably a trope
2015-11-17 04:22:32	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-17 04:28:22	Scruffy	Well, is there anything else you'd like help with?
2015-11-17 04:28:26	Scruffy	On the plot or otherwise
2015-11-17 04:28:32	Scruffy	for the moment?
2015-11-17 04:29:20	@PikFan	uh
2015-11-17 04:29:21	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-17 04:29:33	@PikFan	well, I'm not sure what do to about unlocking new areas
2015-11-17 04:29:46	@PikFan	right now, the unlocking upgrades are keys
2015-11-17 04:29:51	@PikFan	very silly concept...
2015-11-17 04:30:17	@PikFan	hmm
2015-11-17 04:30:38	@PikFan	I need to think of devices that have useful geopositional information
2015-11-17 04:30:52	Scruffy	Hmmm
2015-11-17 04:31:07	Scruffy	In PF, this only happens once
2015-11-17 04:31:12	Scruffy	You collect a car key
2015-11-17 04:31:17	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 04:31:25	Scruffy	That increases the Hocotate ship's reception
2015-11-17 04:31:30	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-17 04:31:42	Scruffy	So you could have radio objects?
2015-11-17 04:31:46	@PikFan	perhaps
2015-11-17 04:32:01	@PikFan	I was also thinking a very small atlas
2015-11-17 04:32:31	@PikFan	oh, a radio dish
2015-11-17 04:32:34	@PikFan	perfect
2015-11-17 04:32:58	Scruffy	those are pretty big
2015-11-17 04:33:17	@PikFan	true
2015-11-17 04:33:18	@PikFan	brb
2015-11-17 04:34:13	Scruffy	ok
2015-11-17 04:34:50	@PikFan	back
2015-11-17 04:34:54	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-17 04:35:04	@PikFan	well...
2015-11-17 04:35:18	@PikFan	maybe a GPS?
2015-11-17 04:38:17	Scruffy	perhaps
2015-11-17 04:38:48	Scruffy	brb
2015-11-17 04:38:53	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-17 04:41:42	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-17 04:41:48	@PikFan	a flash drive and a CD
2015-11-17 04:42:04	@PikFan	okay, I've got three, hopefully this works
2015-11-17 04:52:10	Scruffy	Yeah, those sound good
2015-11-17 04:52:44	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-17 04:53:04	@PikFan	and then the rest of the areas can be unlocked by story progression, picking up signals, etc
2015-11-17 04:53:42	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 04:54:26	@PikFan	heh, nobody's responded to my suggestion yet http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/thread/68/why-pikmin-never-night-mode
2015-11-17 04:54:33	@PikFan	I think my idea is pretty fair
2015-11-17 04:54:43	@PikFan	it's just rearranging the time
2015-11-17 04:54:52	@PikFan	it's like an equation
2015-11-17 04:55:27	@PikFan	well, no
2015-11-17 04:55:42	@PikFan	but combined, it's still the same amount of time
2015-11-17 04:59:57	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 05:00:00	Scruffy	I was thinking
2015-11-17 05:00:12	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-11-17 05:00:22	Scruffy	Perhaps some bosses could be mechanized
2015-11-17 05:00:27	Scruffy	And when you defeat them
2015-11-17 05:00:47	Scruffy	You realize a member of Asfer's underground league was running it
2015-11-17 05:01:02	Scruffy	And they could help point you to Asfer as you arrest them
2015-11-17 05:01:16	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 05:01:32	@PikFan	but... hmm
2015-11-17 05:01:45	@PikFan	wouldn't that be betraying him, though?
2015-11-17 05:01:54	Scruffy	Hmm, true
2015-11-17 05:02:12	@PikFan	but yeah, I agree with the mechanized bosses
2015-11-17 05:02:14	Scruffy	And it would be unlike Olimar to forcefully interrogate them
2015-11-17 05:02:22	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-17 05:02:27	@PikFan	a bit out of character
2015-11-17 05:02:57	Scruffy	unless he didn't do the investigation
2015-11-17 05:03:07	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-11-17 05:03:15	Scruffy	once he arrests them, the agency back on Hocotate interrogates them
2015-11-17 05:03:19	@PikFan	sure
2015-11-17 05:03:35	@PikFan	or, maybe they find a database with clues
2015-11-17 05:03:37	Scruffy	And they send Olimar news on where Asfer is currently, and they go to that new area
2015-11-17 05:03:53	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-11-17 05:04:20	@PikFan	I had meant to tell you this earlier, but I was planning on having a space station orbit PNF-404
2015-11-17 05:04:32	@PikFan	a Hocotatian station
2015-11-17 05:04:45	Scruffy	A Hoco station
2015-11-17 05:04:51	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 05:04:57	@PikFan	oh, another thing
2015-11-17 05:05:14	@PikFan	in this game, the planet will be called PHP-94
2015-11-17 05:05:28	@PikFan	the PHP stands for Potentially Habitable Planet
2015-11-17 05:05:34	Scruffy	Ooh
2015-11-17 05:05:46	Scruffy	how come it's not 404 anymore?
2015-11-17 05:05:58	@PikFan	well
2015-11-17 05:06:16	@PikFan	I also realized that PHP refers to the programming language
2015-11-17 05:06:24	@PikFan	and so the 94 refers to the year it was made
2015-11-17 05:06:29	Scruffy	Oh, hehe
2015-11-17 05:06:31	Scruffy	Cool
2015-11-17 05:06:48	Scruffy	I'd make it 094 then
2015-11-17 05:07:07	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-17 05:07:09	Scruffy	to keep in line with how the International Astronomy Association likes their planets named
2015-11-17 05:07:10	@PikFan	good point
2015-11-17 05:07:15	@PikFan	right
2015-11-17 05:07:22	@PikFan	ah, the IAU...
2015-11-17 05:07:27	@PikFan	why'd you have to kill Pluto
2015-11-17 05:07:32	Scruffy	Oh, that's right
2015-11-17 05:07:36	Scruffy	IAU, not IAA
2015-11-17 05:07:47	@PikFan	hehe
2015-11-17 05:08:05	@PikFan	well, technically it would be PHP-094d
2015-11-17 05:08:09	@PikFan	but eh
2015-11-17 05:08:27	Scruffy	Yeah, no one will fact check you
2015-11-17 05:08:33	Scruffy	on that at least
2015-11-17 05:08:40	@PikFan	other than ourselves
2015-11-17 05:08:57	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 05:10:08	@PikFan	woah, I'd forgotten about Gaia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_%28spacecraft%29
2015-11-17 05:10:17	@PikFan	1 billion stars?! that's crazy!
2015-11-17 05:11:28	@PikFan	I'm also excited for the James Webb Space Telescope
2015-11-17 05:11:42	Scruffy	oh yeah
2015-11-17 05:11:55	@PikFan	I heard it'll be able to analyze the chemical composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets
2015-11-17 05:11:59	@PikFan	that is so cool
2015-11-17 05:12:04	Scruffy	and a 3D space catalog of all those stars
2015-11-17 05:12:13	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-17 05:12:34	Scruffy	It's amazing, the techniques we've developed for observing planets
2015-11-17 05:12:39	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-17 05:12:42	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-17 05:12:56	@PikFan	did you hear about that one star that had a 22% drop in light?
2015-11-17 05:13:24	Scruffy	No!
2015-11-17 05:13:36	Scruffy	Over how much time?
2015-11-17 05:14:02	@PikFan	http://news.discovery.com/space/videos/keplers-alien-megastructure-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-151020.htm
2015-11-17 05:14:21	@PikFan	oh, it's a video
2015-11-17 05:14:21	@PikFan	ugh
2015-11-17 05:14:23	@PikFan	sorry
2015-11-17 05:15:04	@PikFan	wait, here we go http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/alien-megastructure-seti-spies-no-intelligent-signals-151106.htm
2015-11-17 05:17:43	Scruffy	I dunno... I feel like it's probably natural cause
2015-11-17 05:18:03	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-17 05:18:10	Scruffy	I believe in aliens, but I don't know if they'd be advanced enough to build something that could block out a star in our view
2015-11-17 05:18:44	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 05:19:00	@PikFan	they did a 2 week radio survey
2015-11-17 05:19:04	@PikFan	found nothing
2015-11-17 05:19:09	@PikFan	sadly
2015-11-17 05:19:21	Scruffy	Well, that figures.
2015-11-17 05:19:37	@PikFan	or maybe it IS aliens
2015-11-17 05:19:38	Scruffy	But, when was this discovered?
2015-11-17 05:19:46	@PikFan	but they somehow don't use radio signals
2015-11-17 05:19:48	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-17 05:19:52	@PikFan	back in 2011
2015-11-17 05:19:55	Scruffy	oh
2015-11-17 05:20:02	@PikFan	but the major dips in light have a 750 day period
2015-11-17 05:20:24	@PikFan	the results were only published in September
2015-11-17 05:20:56	Scruffy	Ha
2015-11-17 05:20:58	Scruffy	ah*
2015-11-17 05:21:51	@PikFan	...wow, we've been talking for 6 hours
2015-11-17 05:22:07	@PikFan	that's impressive
2015-11-17 05:22:45	Scruffy	Pikmin is certainly a game that warrants all that discussion
2015-11-17 05:22:53	@PikFan	indeed, indeed
2015-11-17 05:23:24	Scruffy	Oh, this astronomy talk had reminded me
2015-11-17 05:23:37	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-11-17 05:24:31	Scruffy	the Small Magellanic Cloud is a good candidate distance-wise, which suggests that Koppai would potentially be observable through telescopes from Earth's surface
2015-11-17 05:24:40	Scruffy	I wrote that on Koppai a while ago
2015-11-17 05:24:45	@PikFan	ah, yes
2015-11-17 05:24:50	@PikFan	I also had speculated that
2015-11-17 05:25:34	@PikFan	when I first heard about the 279,000 light years, I searched to see if there was a galaxy that far away
2015-11-17 05:25:38	@PikFan	and it was the SMC
2015-11-17 05:25:43	Scruffy	Yep
2015-11-17 05:27:13	Scruffy	oh shoot, speaking of talking for 6 hours, I have to go
2015-11-17 05:27:18	Scruffy	it's  12:30
2015-11-17 05:27:22	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-11-17 05:27:28	@PikFan	I don't mean to keep you
2015-11-17 05:27:35	Scruffy	No no it's no problem
2015-11-17 05:27:40	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-17 05:27:41	Scruffy	It's nice to discuss all htis
2015-11-17 05:27:43	Scruffy	this*
2015-11-17 05:27:47	@PikFan	thanks for looking into that music earlier
2015-11-17 05:27:51	Scruffy	And I'm glad to help with PCW
2015-11-17 05:27:55	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 05:28:03	@PikFan	and thanks for that, too
2015-11-17 05:28:03	Scruffy	i'm glad we settled it
2015-11-17 05:28:06	@PikFan	me too
2015-11-17 05:28:13	Scruffy	oh!
2015-11-17 05:28:15	@PikFan	?
2015-11-17 05:28:21	Scruffy	you wanted to rename PCW, right?
2015-11-17 05:28:26	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 05:28:29	Scruffy	hmm
2015-11-17 05:28:33	@PikFan	but we'll discuss that later
2015-11-17 05:28:41	Scruffy	okay, yeah
2015-11-17 05:28:53	@PikFan	tomorrow, maybe, if you're on
2015-11-17 05:29:05	Scruffy	have a good night, I'll be on tomorrow for sure, but not all day
2015-11-17 05:29:07	@PikFan	I'll be on at 5:15 your time, if that works
2015-11-17 05:29:13	Scruffy	maybe
2015-11-17 05:29:17	@PikFan	okay
2015-11-17 05:29:23	@PikFan	night
2015-11-17 05:29:29	Scruffy	I have to vote, I dunno how long it'll take
2015-11-17 05:29:34	Scruffy	but I'll try to be on
2015-11-17 05:29:34	@PikFan	vote?
2015-11-17 05:29:36	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-17 05:29:48	Scruffy	It's a mayoral election
2015-11-17 05:29:53	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-17 05:30:24	Scruffy	shouldn't be too bad, this is the runoff election and the first one went by in like ten minutes
2015-11-17 05:30:29	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-17 05:30:45	@PikFan	well, hope things go smoothly tomorrow
2015-11-17 05:30:47	Scruffy	so, hopefully talk to you tomorrow
2015-11-17 05:30:49	Scruffy	Thanks
2015-11-17 05:30:51	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 05:30:55	Scruffy	good night

2015-11-17 18:53:46	Scruffy	Hi Espyo
2015-11-17 18:54:29	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-11-17 18:54:30	Testyo	Dim Labyrinth is the exception, because secrets
2015-11-17 19:00:40	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-17 19:03:21	Scruffy	Yesterday after you left PikFan had me compare the tune Metal 3 in the Subterranean Complex and the Snagret Hole
2015-11-17 19:03:26	Scruffy	And there was a difference
2015-11-17 19:03:30	Scruffy	I hadn't heard it before
2015-11-17 19:03:34	Scruffy	It's so subtle
2015-11-17 19:03:56	Scruffy	In the melodic gestures
2015-11-17 19:04:15	Scruffy	normal "metal 3" has a melody that uses every note but G
2015-11-17 19:05:17	Scruffy	the subterranean complex and the cavern of chaos use a different file with fewer melodic notes to choose from
2015-11-17 19:05:35	Scruffy	That's why the files are different; they just barely aren't copies of each other
2015-11-17 19:10:26	@Espyo	silly Pikmin 2 is silly
2015-11-17 19:10:30	@Espyo	but yeah, I saw the changes on the page
2015-11-17 19:11:21	Yoshi2	I'd reverse-engineer the hell out of pikmin 2 if I had more time
2015-11-17 19:13:20	@Espyo	same...
2015-11-17 19:13:24	@Espyo	still on my todo list
2015-11-17 19:14:44	Yoshi2	I feel like I could put up with even assembler code
2015-11-17 19:17:08	@Espyo	well, for tiny things, I'd too
2015-11-17 19:17:19	@Espyo	but for crazy things like understanding how the cave generator works?
2015-11-17 19:17:33	@Espyo	I don't think even the devs know how it works with their C code

2015-11-17 19:29:01	Scruffy	Hi En_Passant
2015-11-17 19:29:04	Yoshi2	the worst part is probably trying to figure out what part of the code does the cave generation
2015-11-17 19:29:22	Yoshi2	or plays the music (in case of figuring out BMS stuff)
2015-11-17 19:29:36	@Espyo	well, a lot of people can find where in the assembly what does what
2015-11-17 19:29:40	@Espyo	so there must be easy ways
2015-11-17 19:31:35	En_Passant	Another day in hell, I see
2015-11-17 19:33:24	Yoshi2	I wonder if dolphin offers debugging mechanisms
2015-11-17 19:33:27	Yoshi2	e.g. breakpoints
2015-11-17 19:39:37	@Espyo	it does
2015-11-17 19:41:45	Yoshi2	niiiiiiiiice
2015-11-17 19:41:59	Yoshi2	I totally need to play around with that
2015-11-17 19:48:06	@Espyo	mhm
2015-11-17 19:49:08	Yoshi2	although going from a microcontroller to a system with a graphics chip and other fun stuff is probably a very big step

2015-11-17 22:12:19	@PikFan	Espyo, there
2015-11-17 22:12:25	@PikFan	's something we need to talk about
2015-11-17 22:12:47	@PikFan	so I watched the latest PikCast, and they mentioned that Pikmin Fanon will be moving to the new forums
2015-11-17 22:13:17	@PikFan	I'm not sure if that was a misstatement, or what, but could you clear things up, since you're in contact with them?
2015-11-17 22:24:27	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-17 22:24:37	@Espyo	hmm, odd
2015-11-17 22:25:00	@PikFan	just kinda hit a nerve
2015-11-17 22:25:17	@PikFan	like, they didn't even ask
2015-11-17 22:25:38	@Espyo	they have to have meant something else
2015-11-17 22:25:40	-->	Scruffy (Mibbit@100.43.lo.zpv) has joined #pikipedia
2015-11-17 22:25:42	@PikFan	in the video they said "I'm not sure how the people of Fanon are going to feel about moving to the forums"
2015-11-17 22:25:44	@Espyo	nobody would say that without asking
2015-11-17 22:25:45	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2015-11-17 22:26:04	@PikFan	maybe I'm just misinterpreting
2015-11-17 22:26:22	Scruffy	Hey
2015-11-17 22:26:33	@PikFan	maybe they meant that they're not sure about how people will feel about signing up on the forums
2015-11-17 22:26:40	@PikFan	idk, it's bothering me...
2015-11-17 22:26:43	@PikFan	oh yeah, Espyo
2015-11-17 22:26:54	@PikFan	Scruffy figured out the weird Metal 3 thing last night
2015-11-17 22:27:23	@Espyo	mhm, I saw the edit
2015-11-17 22:27:28	@Espyo	and he talked to me about it, some
2015-11-17 22:27:34	@PikFan	oh okay
2015-11-17 22:27:38	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 and its little things...
2015-11-17 22:27:41	@Espyo	we should make a list one day
2015-11-17 22:27:42	@PikFan	indeed
2015-11-17 22:27:46	@Espyo	maybe not for the wiki, because it's kinda subjective
2015-11-17 22:27:51	@PikFan	I also showed him the todo list
2015-11-17 22:27:55	@Espyo	what counts as "small"? and "interesting"? and "weird"?
2015-11-17 22:28:18	@PikFan	one of the big ones is the cave units discrepancies
2015-11-17 22:28:19	Scruffy	I'd say even something as big as Ujadani counts as those three things
2015-11-17 22:28:44	Scruffy	At least it did for me when I went on here years ago and discovered them
2015-11-17 22:28:46	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 22:28:55	Scruffy	otherwise I seriously never would have found them
2015-11-17 22:29:14	@PikFan	it'd be cool to hack the game to go to the Wistful Wild on day 1 and see them there
2015-11-17 22:29:19	@PikFan	...oh!
2015-11-17 22:29:27	@PikFan	okay, let's say that does happen
2015-11-17 22:29:38	@PikFan	what do they release, given that sprays aren't discovered?
2015-11-17 22:29:44	@PikFan	...well, no
2015-11-17 22:29:53	@PikFan	anybody can do that if they don't discover sprays
2015-11-17 22:29:55	Scruffy	They'd just release netar
2015-11-17 22:29:55	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmm
2015-11-17 22:30:02	Scruffy	nectar*
2015-11-17 22:30:06	@PikFan	oh, really?
2015-11-17 22:30:09	@PikFan	what a letdown
2015-11-17 22:30:28	@PikFan	I was getting excited, maybe they'd still drop sprays
2015-11-17 22:30:31	Scruffy	Yeah, if you don't have a spray then no spray source will give it to you but Burgeoning Spiderworts
2015-11-17 22:30:49	@PikFan	I suppose so
2015-11-17 22:31:11	Scruffy	Ok, now I can truly say I'm halfway through with the animation
2015-11-17 22:31:42	Scruffy	I think I've been halfway done, actually
2015-11-17 22:32:28	@PikFan	awesome
2015-11-17 22:33:37	Scruffy	If it concerns you, Espyo, I'm creating this animation using Pikmin models I've collected
2015-11-17 22:33:39	@PikFan	would the style be something like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZliYTxhl0c
2015-11-17 22:33:39	Testyo	0 C = 32 °F / 273.15 K
2015-11-17 22:33:41	Scruffy	It's short
2015-11-17 22:33:56	Scruffy	But it's something I think Pikipedia and Pikmin Fanon users can appreciate
2015-11-17 22:34:55	@Espyo	awesome!
2015-11-17 22:35:27	Scruffy	Thanks
2015-11-17 22:36:29	Scruffy	PikFan: I'd say since it's 25 seconds there's little time for a story like that, but the graphics are similar
2015-11-17 22:36:30	Scruffy	Although
2015-11-17 22:36:48	@PikFan	I meant the graphics, yeah
2015-11-17 22:36:52	Scruffy	Oh
2015-11-17 22:37:08	Scruffy	Well, sort of
2015-11-17 22:37:19	Scruffy	Most of the effects in that video are texture-based
2015-11-17 22:37:25	@PikFan	wait, oh
2015-11-17 22:37:32	@PikFan	you're talking about the very short short
2015-11-17 22:37:37	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-17 22:37:44	@PikFan	I thought you were talking about PF's prologue
2015-11-17 22:37:55	Scruffy	That does have similar graphics to the video you showed
2015-11-17 22:38:01	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-11-17 22:38:16	Scruffy	This really short video, I can afford to go a bit better
2015-11-17 22:38:29	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-17 22:38:43	Scruffy	And realistically calculate light
2015-11-17 22:39:09	Scruffy	I really want to keep this one a surprise though
2015-11-17 22:39:14	Scruffy	It's only 25 seconds
2015-11-17 22:39:17	@PikFan	hehe, yeah
2015-11-17 23:00:18	@PikFan	"But the problem is that all logic points to the fact that the NX would be released in holiday 2016."
2015-11-17 23:00:21	@PikFan	people
2015-11-17 23:00:22	@PikFan	are
2015-11-17 23:00:24	@PikFan	such
2015-11-17 23:00:26	@PikFan	idiots
2015-11-17 23:00:56	@PikFan	people don't understand that a console is usually launched the year AFTER it's officially revealed
2015-11-17 23:01:24	@PikFan	the NX will probably launch in holiday 2017
2015-11-17 23:02:50	Scruffy	Hopefully plenty of time for Nintendo to polish off and release Pikmin 4 for the Wii u
2015-11-17 23:04:09	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-17 23:04:54	@PikFan	I hope they show information soon
2015-11-17 23:11:42	Scruffy	Me too
2015-11-17 23:11:45	@PikFan	hahahah
2015-11-17 23:12:07	@PikFan	people are starting to predict doom and gloom for the NX http://www.nintendo-insider.com/2015/11/16/nintendo-nx-doomed-before-it-launches-without-key-third-party-support/
2015-11-17 23:12:27	@PikFan	...Michael Pachter? pfft
2015-11-17 23:16:48	Scruffy	I feel like Nintendo doesn't care
2015-11-17 23:17:02	Scruffy	I mean sure they'd want the NX to do well
2015-11-17 23:17:20	Scruffy	But they seem to adopt an attitude of thinking all their consoles and titles are doing very well
2015-11-17 23:17:57	@PikFan	I don't like how Pachter is saying that the NX has to be like Microsoft/Sony consoles in order to do well
2015-11-17 23:18:02	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 23:18:05	@PikFan	basically, he's telling Nintendo to conform
2015-11-17 23:18:05	Scruffy	He's just biased
2015-11-17 23:18:08	@PikFan	that's BS
2015-11-17 23:18:14	Scruffy	Personally I don't like the PS4
2015-11-17 23:18:24	Scruffy	My family got one last Christmas
2015-11-17 23:18:38	@PikFan	I don't care for either of them, since I'm not interested in any of their games
2015-11-17 23:18:50	Scruffy	it was clunkier, games glitchier, controllers started deteriorating
2015-11-17 23:18:56	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-11-17 23:19:01	Scruffy	Not to mention Sony was hacked pretty soon after PS4s were released
2015-11-17 23:19:04	@PikFan	yeah, Nintendo's consoles have always been tough
2015-11-17 23:19:20	Scruffy	And no one bothers to hack into Nintendo
2015-11-17 23:19:38	@PikFan	my Wii has fallen off my entertainment system (which is like 4-5 feet tall) so many times and it still works
2015-11-17 23:19:38	Testyo	-5 feet = -152.4 cm
2015-11-17 23:19:46	Scruffy	Haha
2015-11-17 23:19:58	@PikFan	the power and reset button don't work, but the eject button does, fortunately
2015-11-17 23:20:01	Scruffy	yeah, I much preferred the PS3 to 4
2015-11-17 23:20:07	Scruffy	But still prefer the Wii U to both
2015-11-17 23:20:27	@PikFan	especially since it has HD graphics
2015-11-17 23:20:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-17 23:20:44	Scruffy	And, personally, the Gamepad feels fine in my hands
2015-11-17 23:20:49	@PikFan	same
2015-11-17 23:20:52	Scruffy	it's feels ergonomic
2015-11-17 23:20:56	@PikFan	it is
2015-11-17 23:21:02	Scruffy	Nothing can beat the GameCube controllers though
2015-11-17 23:21:12	Scruffy	imo
2015-11-17 23:21:25	Scruffy	I haven't tried Xbox though
2015-11-17 23:21:26	@PikFan	actually, I tried using a Pro Controller, but it felt a bit weird because I'm so used to playing on the GamePad
2015-11-17 23:21:31	@PikFan	and I agree
2015-11-17 23:21:51	@PikFan	if they had ZL, ZR buttons, and + and - buttons, it'd be even better
2015-11-17 23:21:59	Scruffy	I guess
2015-11-17 23:22:17	Scruffy	I feel like the simplicity and color really pulled it together though
2015-11-17 23:22:26	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-11-17 23:22:29	Scruffy	I don't think the GameCube needed any enhancements
2015-11-17 23:22:46	@PikFan	I never got a WaveBird, but that would've been cool
2015-11-17 23:22:54	Scruffy	Oh they're sweet
2015-11-17 23:23:03	@PikFan	the cord sometimes bothers me
2015-11-17 23:23:15	Scruffy	I don't remember ever replacing the battery and it still runs
2015-11-17 23:23:31	Scruffy	I just wish there were something to hook it up to a laptop
2015-11-17 23:23:38	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-17 23:23:56	@PikFan	by the way, I'm gonna have to get going soon
2015-11-17 23:23:56	Scruffy	I have to play Pikmin and Pikmin 2 with the keyboard until I head home
2015-11-17 23:24:02	Scruffy	No problem
2015-11-17 23:24:13	Scruffy	I'll have to go soon too, but I'll probably be back later
2015-11-17 23:24:25	Scruffy	In about 30 minutes I'm leaving
2015-11-17 23:24:39	@PikFan	I won't be, my mom is using the computer tonight
2015-11-17 23:24:46	Scruffy	Ah ok
2015-11-17 23:24:51	Scruffy	Well have a good evening

2015-11-18 18:20:44	Jpmrocks	its Unreal Engine

2015-11-18 18:21:22	ScruffyChat	So, not peaceful music then? Dramatic?
2015-11-18 18:21:42	Jpmrocks	i'll let you take creative liscense on that one

2015-11-18 18:26:11	Jpmrocks	how long does it usually take you to make a song?
2015-11-18 18:26:20	ScruffyChat	At least a day
2015-11-18 18:26:37	ScruffyChat	Well, no, I can usually make one in less time
2015-11-18 18:27:02	ScruffyChat	It's just that I also have some calculus to take care of, and a Pikmin Fanon user is expecting their request as well
2015-11-18 18:27:42	Jpmrocks	ah of course
2015-11-18 18:28:02	Jpmrocks	would you be able to make a song by saturday if i send you the pics today?
2015-11-18 18:28:32	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-11-18 18:28:46	ScruffyChat	Or at least, I can send you the song for you to make suggestions about
2015-11-18 18:29:07	ScruffyChat	I just have to ask that you don't share the song publicly, other than where you need it in your level
2015-11-18 18:29:18	Jpmrocks	of course
2015-11-18 18:30:06	ScruffyChat	Great

2015-11-18 20:49:52	@PikFan	okay, this computer works
2015-11-18 20:49:57	En_Passant	It's probably just a problem with having a transparent background
2015-11-18 20:50:03	CraftedPbody	yeah
2015-11-18 20:50:10	CraftedPbody	It's an EASY fix
2015-11-18 20:51:37	@PikFan	okay, so
2015-11-18 20:52:06	@PikFan	I watched the latest PikCast recently
2015-11-18 20:52:26	@PikFan	and someone in it said, "I'm not sure how users on Pikmin Fanon will feel about moving"
2015-11-18 20:52:35	@PikFan	*moving to the forums
2015-11-18 20:52:58	@PikFan	my interpretation is that we're abandoning Fanon and just moving to the forums
2015-11-18 20:53:03	@PikFan	that's not true, is it?
2015-11-18 20:54:55	Yoshi2	because a forum is totally a good replacement for a wiki
2015-11-18 20:55:24	CraftedPbody	I'm not sure... I actually wasn't here for the last Pikcast, but I don't think we're abandoning them. They've been pretty barren... :/
2015-11-18 20:55:48	@PikFan	I agree, it's barren
2015-11-18 20:55:51	CraftedPbody	Though..
2015-11-18 20:56:50	Jpmrocks	that wasnt the intention if it WAS said
2015-11-18 20:56:51	@PikFan	wait, I'm reading Sushi's reply
2015-11-18 20:57:00	@PikFan	that's not what he meant
2015-11-18 20:57:06	CraftedPbody	I can't say either way is what I'm saying.
2015-11-18 20:59:46	@PikFan	okay, got this mess cleared up

2015-11-18 21:03:10	Jpmrocks	its good, but i feel it needs drums

2015-11-18 21:03:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I kinda felt that as well

2015-11-18 21:23:14	En_Passant	This last area in my game is still frustrating me
2015-11-18 21:23:53	ScruffyChat	The polar mountain?
2015-11-18 21:24:11	ScruffyChat	no, wait, the mystery crater?
2015-11-18 21:24:23	En_Passant	The former
2015-11-18 21:24:27	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-18 21:25:17	ScruffyChat	Wasn't it going to be 3 parts of a large building?
2015-11-18 21:25:43	ScruffyChat	And... the trouble was there was no seamless way of moving between them
2015-11-18 21:25:53	Jpmrocks	lol, we should make a level design portion on the forums kek
2015-11-18 21:32:13	En_Passant	Not exactly
2015-11-18 21:32:22	En_Passant	They were going to be around the building
2015-11-18 21:32:51	En_Passant	And I'm having trouble deciding what the third area that has the boss in it should look like
2015-11-18 21:34:01	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-11-18 21:34:20	ScruffyChat	I apologize, remind me of the look of the first two areas
2015-11-18 21:34:44	En_Passant	Clear Creek, the first one, has lots of water due to melting snow
2015-11-18 21:35:03	En_Passant	That was yesterday for me
2015-11-18 21:35:21	En_Passant	You find Blues there
2015-11-18 21:35:35	ScruffyChat	Right, right
2015-11-18 21:35:50	En_Passant	Glimmering Ridge, the second area, has large snow banks and other elevation changes, and you find Wingeds there
2015-11-18 21:36:14	ScruffyChat	Will Clear Creek have a lot of ice?
2015-11-18 21:36:29	ScruffyChat	Because you could save ice for the boss's area
2015-11-18 21:36:30	En_Passant	It will have some, but not a lot
2015-11-18 21:36:37	En_Passant	Its cave will be ice-themed, though
2015-11-18 21:36:41	ScruffyChat	oh
2015-11-18 21:36:44	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-11-18 21:38:48	En_Passant	I'd like to have a more industrial-themed area, but that might also be more fitting of a cave
2015-11-18 21:39:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-18 21:39:55	ScruffyChat	In the Forbidding Precipice, I plan to have structures based off of mining equipment
2015-11-18 21:40:09	ScruffyChat	It doesn't have to be absolutely accurate
2015-11-18 21:41:04	ScruffyChat	Maybe an iced-over road?
2015-11-18 21:41:12	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2015-11-18 21:41:13	ScruffyChat	That's sort of the Valley of Repose
2015-11-18 21:43:44	En_Passant	Clear Creek would probably be that
2015-11-18 21:43:51	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-11-18 21:43:52	En_Passant	Curbs are where water accumulates
2015-11-18 21:44:20	En_Passant	I'm thinking about how large I want the building to be
2015-11-18 21:44:47	En_Passant	If I'm to call it a mountain, it should probably be tall
2015-11-18 21:45:15	En_Passant	But that would also require the areas to ascend the mountain, reducing the openness of it
2015-11-18 21:47:19	ScruffyChat	You don't necessarily have to climb the mountain
2015-11-18 21:47:48	ScruffyChat	The Cometdust Magjay doesn't have to be at the summit, that is
2015-11-18 21:47:48	En_Passant	That's very true
2015-11-18 21:47:58	En_Passant	Oh
2015-11-18 21:48:09	En_Passant	Well, it's more climactic that way
2015-11-18 21:48:18	ScruffyChat	True
2015-11-18 21:48:23	En_Passant	I was thinking that you meant you didn't necessarily have to start at the base
2015-11-18 21:48:36	ScruffyChat	That's very true as well
2015-11-18 21:48:50	En_Passant	Hills could easily make it look tall, especially since it's all covered in snow
2015-11-18 21:49:01	ScruffyChat	Yeah, you're right, if you give players a mountain, you're basically telling them, "see you at the top"
2015-11-18 21:49:38	En_Passant	Plus, urban birds making a nest on the roof of a building's not uncommon
2015-11-18 21:50:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-11-18 21:50:22	ScruffyChat	Hmm, now that you mention urban birds
2015-11-18 21:51:42	ScruffyChat	Ah, never mind
2015-11-18 21:51:57	ScruffyChat	I looked up urban bird reference photos but none of them look very industrial
2015-11-18 21:54:29	ScruffyChat	But this boss should test the player's mettle with Blue and Winged Pikmin
2015-11-18 21:54:47	ScruffyChat	So wherever it is should combine water and elevation changes
2015-11-18 22:02:35	Jpmrocks	whatre yall talkin aboot?
2015-11-18 22:06:17	En_Passant	My fangame

2015-11-18 22:12:27	ScruffyChat	Perhaps the mountain isn't a building
2015-11-18 22:12:38	ScruffyChat	But a boat frozen in a lake
2015-11-18 22:12:40	ScruffyChat	?
2015-11-18 22:15:39	ScruffyChat	like at a small dock, there would be a reasonably sized boat, frozen in the water
2015-11-18 22:15:57	ScruffyChat	Not an urban dock (the water'd be too deep to freeze) but perhaps a personal pier
2015-11-18 22:16:26	ScruffyChat	A boat seems like a more scalable object to me than the vertical walls of a building

2015-11-19 00:46:33	@PikFan	just got back from hanging out with IRL friends, which is why I came back later than normal
2015-11-19 00:46:34	@PikFan	you?
2015-11-19 00:46:56	CraftedPbody	Oh I'm working on a Pikmin Map idea.
2015-11-19 00:47:03	@PikFan	ah, neat
2015-11-19 00:47:22	@PikFan	I drew a map for one of my areas, but I never got around to drawing the other ones
2015-11-19 00:47:28	CraftedPbody	I can take screenshots of it, but I'd like to work on it more.
2015-11-19 00:47:34	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-11-19 00:47:55	CraftedPbody	I'm also listening to Green Yards
2015-11-19 00:47:58	@PikFan	do you draw yours by hand, or with a program?
2015-11-19 00:47:59	@PikFan	nice
2015-11-19 00:48:46	CraftedPbody	I draw mine on Paint.net. They don't look GREAT, but they don't seem like they're terrible.
2015-11-19 00:48:55	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-19 00:49:02	@PikFan	I drew mine by hand

2015-11-19 00:50:49	CraftedPbody	It looks well drawn

2015-11-19 00:51:01	@PikFan	thanks
2015-11-19 00:51:08	@PikFan	it turned out a lot better than I thought
2015-11-19 00:51:13	CraftedPbody	I have some stuff on the fanon wiki.
2015-11-19 00:51:20	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-19 00:51:36	@PikFan	I'm actually looking for one of the maps you made
2015-11-19 00:51:49	CraftedPbody	I don't really LOVE any of the stuff I have on the fanon though... :/
2015-11-19 00:52:12	@PikFan	oh, that's too bad...
2015-11-19 00:52:23	@PikFan	I like your Benign Bosk area
2015-11-19 00:52:37	CraftedPbody	Benign Bosk is kind of meh...
2015-11-19 00:53:24	@PikFan	its map is more complete than mine
2015-11-19 00:53:50	CraftedPbody	How about this cave idea I had? http://www.pikminfanon.com/Buried_Garden
2015-11-19 00:55:14	En_Passant	Your sublevels are different parts of the area?
2015-11-19 00:55:16	@PikFan	I like it!

2015-11-19 00:57:07	CraftedPbody	Basically, the way I pictured caves is that they're still sublevels, but pikmin carry stuff out of them rather than you delving into them and the ship following. They count as a different area though.
2015-11-19 00:57:55	@PikFan	ah

2015-11-19 01:01:53	@PikFan	woah
2015-11-19 01:02:02	CraftedPbody	Hm?
2015-11-19 01:02:11	@PikFan	it's big
2015-11-19 01:02:58	CraftedPbody	Yeah, in this map, which is something I actually like so-far, there will be multiple landings.
2015-11-19 01:03:08	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-11-19 01:03:20	CraftedPbody	But you need to find these other landing spots.
2015-11-19 01:03:24	@PikFan	just like Scruffy's areas!
2015-11-19 01:03:29	@PikFan	right
2015-11-19 01:03:34	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-11-19 01:03:46	CraftedPbody	Seasons are also a thing
2015-11-19 01:03:49	@PikFan	I wonder if I should have more landing zones in my areas...
2015-11-19 01:04:00	@PikFan	oh, you mean like seasonal weather?
2015-11-19 01:04:28	Creative	Heya Jordan
2015-11-19 01:04:36	Creative	I've done some cleaning up on the forum
2015-11-19 01:04:52	CraftedPbody	I dislike how pikmin 2 and 3 have areas based on seasons. I feel areas should have seasons that specifically happen for them. 10 or 5 day seasons.
2015-11-19 01:05:05	Creative	I've merged 2 boards

2015-11-19 01:05:49	Creative	it keeps it more orderly and when theres a comment its dicolored

2015-11-19 01:11:23	@PikFan	I like laptops/desktops over tablets
2015-11-19 01:11:31	@PikFan	it
2015-11-19 01:11:39	@PikFan	it's easier to type on normal computers

2015-11-19 01:12:08	@PikFan	(just contradicted myself because I accidentally hit enter, I tend to do that a lot)
2015-11-19 01:12:15	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-19 01:12:17	Creative_Sushi	I agree, typing is easier
2015-11-19 01:12:20	Creative_Sushi	but mouse pads suck
2015-11-19 01:12:20	@PikFan	it's your game
2015-11-19 01:12:27	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-19 01:12:31	@PikFan	they do
2015-11-19 01:12:44	@PikFan	that's why I use an actual mouse :P
2015-11-19 01:12:50	Creative_Sushi	I need to 
2015-11-19 01:12:58	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-19 01:13:05	Creative_Sushi	Its like laptops go all out with the keyboard because your kinda stuck with it
2015-11-19 01:13:11	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-19 01:13:17	Creative_Sushi	i mean you could plug in another but nobody brings one around with them
2015-11-19 01:13:27	@PikFan	right
2015-11-19 01:13:33	Creative_Sushi	but the mouse they assume your going to plug one in anyway so they don't give it any attension
2015-11-19 01:13:36	Creative_Sushi	or little rather
2015-11-19 01:13:41	@PikFan	also, normal keyboards don't have emojis on them
2015-11-19 01:13:52	Creative_Sushi	?
2015-11-19 01:14:02	@PikFan	like, I don't use emojis all the time, but I think it'd be convenient if there was some way to type an emoji
2015-11-19 01:14:19	Creative_Sushi	you mean with just one button?
2015-11-19 01:14:33	@PikFan	not exactly
2015-11-19 01:14:36	CraftedPbody	Yeah, but like does it make sense? I mean you don't get any winged pikmin until late game, so they aren't a threat normally... But  when carrying a fruit or treasure, pikmin might stop for the web...
2015-11-19 01:14:40	@PikFan	like, a combination
2015-11-19 01:14:48	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-19 01:15:07	@PikFan	well, what if the web was lower, so it touched the ground?
2015-11-19 01:16:00	CraftedPbody	But I'm saying that like difficulty wise, how would an arachnode be if you see them and you only have reds?
2015-11-19 01:16:25	@PikFan	depends on their HP
2015-11-19 01:17:05	@PikFan	like, if it had the same amount of HP as in P3, then I don't think it'd be too much trouble
2015-11-19 01:17:29	CraftedPbody	I mean, in most circumstances you can just pass under the web and be fine, but I suppose if you're carrying back a large treasure they might pose a threat... Also, they'd be exactly as they are in P3.
2015-11-19 01:17:45	@PikFan	oh, I see what you mean
2015-11-19 01:17:46	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-11-19 01:18:37	CraftedPbody	Here's the placement: https://i.gyazo.com/7a0ba640c729a9bcae66b0fe14856d3b.png
2015-11-19 01:19:05	@PikFan	do you plan on having a tall treasure behind it?
2015-11-19 01:19:40	CraftedPbody	It'll probably be a whole part of the area, so possibly.
2015-11-19 01:20:09	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-19 01:20:29	@PikFan	in that case, I'd imagine it'd be like Winged Pikmin
2015-11-19 01:20:30	CraftedPbody	They'd get in the way for a bulborb carcass 
2015-11-19 01:20:44	@PikFan	the treasure gets stuck in the web
2015-11-19 01:20:58	@PikFan	the Pikmin wouldn't be in danger, since they're on the ground
2015-11-19 01:21:02	CraftedPbody	Like the pikmin would stop and circle as if it were an incomplete bridge.
2015-11-19 01:21:13	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-19 01:21:22	@PikFan	sure, then
2015-11-19 01:22:16	CraftedPbody	It'd be a waste of time to not deal with them, but would that be too hard with just reds or possibly reds and yellows?
2015-11-19 01:22:43	@PikFan	I don't think so
2015-11-19 01:23:20	@PikFan	for me, Arachnodes were annoying to kill, because when they'd shake off Pikmin, they'd get stuck in the web, and the Arachnode would eat them before I could save them
2015-11-19 01:23:31	@PikFan	again, that's just me
2015-11-19 01:23:44	CraftedPbody	yeah, and they eat 2 at a time...
2015-11-19 01:23:56	@PikFan	but it shouldn't be too hard if you attack it carefully
2015-11-19 01:24:02	@PikFan	they're pretty weak anyway
2015-11-19 01:24:03	CraftedPbody	such a weird number to eat
2015-11-19 01:24:08	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-19 01:24:13	CraftedPbody	ok so it's fair
2015-11-19 01:24:29	@PikFan	yup
2015-11-19 01:36:35	En_Passant	What's the difference between these new Arachnode webs and just having a dirt wall there?
2015-11-19 01:37:22	@PikFan	I think the web acts as an obstacle for treasures, but not for Pikmin
2015-11-19 01:37:35	@PikFan	besides Winged Pikmin
2015-11-19 01:42:47	CraftedPbody	It also doesn't stop stuff like berries and fragments
2015-11-19 01:43:20	CraftedPbody	Also they're wider
2015-11-19 01:43:53	@PikFan	question, would it possible to have a big web with multiple Arachnodes on it?
2015-11-19 01:44:22	En_Passant	Don't see any reason why not
2015-11-19 01:46:10	CraftedPbody	Well... Arachnodes relate to spiders to a heavy degree, so it depends if you see them as the cannibalistic type, like most spiders are, or colony living spiders, being hobo spiders and tent spiders
2015-11-19 01:46:37	CraftedPbody	I can see them as either
2015-11-19 01:46:38	@PikFan	true
2015-11-19 01:46:54	@PikFan	oh, maybe have different subspecies
2015-11-19 01:47:40	@PikFan	on the subject of Arachnodes, I'm thinking of having an Arachnode being the true final boss of my fangame
2015-11-19 01:47:48	@PikFan	it'd be called the Arachlord
2015-11-19 01:47:49	CraftedPbody	They're alot like sheet weavers
2015-11-19 01:48:29	CraftedPbody	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Sheet_weaver_spider_web.jpg look at this
2015-11-19 01:48:46	CraftedPbody	It's even weaved its web on a shoot.
2015-11-19 01:48:52	@PikFan	wow
2015-11-19 01:49:40	CraftedPbody	http://bugguide.net/images/raw/TLS/Z1L/TLSZ1L7ZTLMZAL7Z9L7ZZH7ZAL3LFZ0RCZSRFZZZFZMRNLJL6LIRTZ3LTZIRULQRLH4RQHSZLHKR.jpg this is the spider
2015-11-19 01:50:18	@PikFan	kinda looks like a garden spider

2015-11-19 01:55:19	CraftedPbody	So I'm thinking of removing my Map ideas on the fanon and starting fresh in that category...
2015-11-19 01:55:32	@PikFan	are you sure?
2015-11-19 01:55:57	CraftedPbody	I think I'm sure, but not fully yet...
2015-11-19 01:56:15	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-11-19 01:56:25	CraftedPbody	I'm fine with my treasure idea and enemy ideas
2015-11-19 01:56:32	@PikFan	so... you want to get rid of the Benign Bosk, Torrid Den, and Buried Garden?
2015-11-19 01:56:55	CraftedPbody	Which have you seen my Sudoric Bulblax on the forums? Also maybe not Torrid Den
2015-11-19 01:57:53	CraftedPbody	http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/thread/21/sudoric-bulblax-enemy
2015-11-19 01:58:08	@PikFan	oh yeah
2015-11-19 01:58:18	CraftedPbody	What say you on that?
2015-11-19 01:58:39	@PikFan	solidified sweat around its eyes? interesting
2015-11-19 01:58:52	@PikFan	kinda gross, but still interesting
2015-11-19 02:00:52	CraftedPbody	Take a guess by what I've written and anything you know of the Fiery Bulblax about how it behaves.
2015-11-19 02:01:00	@PikFan	so it's the watery (sweaty...?) version of — yeah
2015-11-19 02:01:23	@PikFan	you have to use Blues against it
2015-11-19 02:01:41	@PikFan	also, it sleeps, just like the Fiery Bulblax
2015-11-19 02:02:09	@PikFan	I've always wondered why the Fiery Bulblax had asymmetrical eyes
2015-11-19 02:02:46	CraftedPbody	The fiery bulblax is shorter ranged than a bulborb and is also more aggressive, not shaking pikmin off as frequently.
2015-11-19 02:03:15	CraftedPbody	So how do you think a Sudoric Bulblax behaves
2015-11-19 02:03:29	@PikFan	the opposite?
2015-11-19 02:03:37	@PikFan	long range, but less aggressive?
2015-11-19 02:03:48	CraftedPbody	You have one right
2015-11-19 02:04:14	@PikFan	uh... more aggressive?
2015-11-19 02:04:34	CraftedPbody	It's more defensive than the fiery bulblax, but it's even less likely to chase pikmin long distances.
2015-11-19 02:04:48	@PikFan	ohhh
2015-11-19 02:05:41	@PikFan	sorry
2015-11-19 02:05:55	CraftedPbody	no, it's not any problem
2015-11-19 02:06:09	CraftedPbody	I was just seeing what you could guess
2015-11-19 02:06:16	@PikFan	I see
2015-11-19 02:06:27	@PikFan	well, I like it
2015-11-19 02:06:47	CraftedPbody	The temperament isn't listed so...

2015-11-19 02:19:53	@PikFan	yes, why?
2015-11-19 02:20:07	CraftedPbody	Did you notice the notes?
2015-11-19 02:20:30	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-19 02:20:41	@PikFan	one of them had seasonal variations for the enemies
2015-11-19 02:21:00	CraftedPbody	did you see "Pullable Bark"?
2015-11-19 02:21:33	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-11-19 02:21:40	@PikFan	it's hard to read, but I see it
2015-11-19 02:22:25	CraftedPbody	Well, it's an idea I had where it'd be like flukeweed, except any pikmin can pull it and it's horizontal instead of vertical
2015-11-19 02:22:39	CraftedPbody	And stuff is hidden under it
2015-11-19 02:22:40	@PikFan	ah
2015-11-19 02:22:42	@PikFan	mhm
2015-11-19 02:22:49	@PikFan	that's pretty cool

2015-11-19 02:25:34	CraftedPbody	Mitites and a Armored Cannon Beetle Larva, but all you get that is good is the 2 single pellets
2015-11-19 02:25:57	@PikFan	can't you just kill them, though? then they become good
2015-11-19 02:26:17	CraftedPbody	yeah
2015-11-19 02:26:46	CraftedPbody	but your pikmin will freak out if you weren't using only purples
2015-11-19 02:27:04	CraftedPbody	(Mitites)
2015-11-19 02:27:05	@PikFan	hm, true
2015-11-19 02:30:47	En_Passant	Funny that you call it A. Cannon Beetle Larva
2015-11-19 02:30:53	En_Passant	Because both variants in P3 start with A
2015-11-19 02:31:27	CraftedPbody	I'm going to refer to Arctic as AC. Cannon Beetle Larva
2015-11-19 02:32:47	En_Passant	Why not just Armored Larva and Arctic Larva?
2015-11-19 02:32:55	En_Passant	Much shorter
2015-11-19 02:34:13	CraftedPbody	Well I can't easily change it so... Just gonna keep the format.
2015-11-19 02:35:26	@PikFan	En_Passant: but if it was "Armored Larva", it could refer to anything
2015-11-19 02:35:34	@PikFan	armored larva of what?
2015-11-19 02:36:03	En_Passant	Do you know any other enemies with Armored Larva in their name?
2015-11-19 02:37:00	CraftedPbody	I actually have another fanon enemy that has Larva in the name, considering the adult has an armored texture...
2015-11-19 02:39:15	@PikFan	well, no, but I mean, new players to the series might be confused
2015-11-19 02:39:24	@PikFan	it's a pretty broad name
2015-11-19 02:40:33	CraftedPbody	But yes and no to what I added
2015-11-19 02:41:23	CraftedPbody	New people of the series might get confused, and people who know my stuff might take it as Culinid Larva
2015-11-19 02:52:41	CraftedPbody	Making good progress on my map.
2015-11-19 02:52:55	@PikFan	yay!
2015-11-19 02:53:38	CraftedPbody	I mean that means nothing with the full scale...

2015-11-19 02:53:54	CraftedPbody	But I mean, I've gotten alot done
2015-11-19 02:53:56	@PikFan	what's the area called?

2015-11-19 22:51:35	@Espyo	Testyo's just saying nonsense
2015-11-19 22:51:36	Testyo	while seeing pikmin of different colours would be fun, I think they got away

2015-11-19 23:02:08	Scruffy	My laptop is back from the dead
2015-11-19 23:02:12	@PikFan	hi
2015-11-19 23:02:35	Scruffy	Hi
2015-11-19 23:02:43	@Espyo	hi
2015-11-19 23:02:45	@Espyo	well that was quick
2015-11-19 23:02:49	Scruffy	My computer couldn't find its startup file last night
2015-11-19 23:02:57	Scruffy	But it turns out it can repair itself
2015-11-19 23:03:09	Scruffy	or, the hard drive can repair the disk
2015-11-19 23:03:12	@PikFan	yay
2015-11-19 23:03:16	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-11-19 23:03:30	Scruffy	I just want to be more cautious
2015-11-19 23:03:42	Scruffy	So I'm going to be a little lighter on using Blender for a while

2015-11-19 23:03:49	Scruffy	It's not good for my computer
2015-11-19 23:03:51	@PikFan	mm
2015-11-19 23:04:01	@PikFan	do you know why your laptop died?
2015-11-19 23:04:41	Scruffy	Current explanation is that something caused a software malfunction, and it couldn't find the very file that starts its OS
2015-11-19 23:04:52	@PikFan	oh
2015-11-19 23:05:06	Scruffy	Or, could find it, but couldn't read it

2015-11-19 23:05:24	@PikFan	well, it's good that your computer was able to read it again
2015-11-19 23:05:27	Scruffy	Yes
2015-11-19 23:05:32	Scruffy	Without losing anything
2015-11-19 23:05:35	@PikFan	right
2015-11-19 23:05:40	Scruffy	I was really surprised at that
2015-11-19 23:06:06	Yoyo	Losing stuff is terrible.
2015-11-19 23:06:19	@Espyo	okay, I know a way to make Pikmin 3 freak out
2015-11-19 23:06:22	@Espyo	but we need science
2015-11-19 23:06:30	 *	@PikFan gives Espyo science
2015-11-19 23:06:35	Scruffy	I can apply science
2015-11-19 23:06:45	Scruffy	Decimals
2015-11-19 23:06:45	Yoyo	Fire away.
2015-11-19 23:07:01	@Espyo	when you unlock a new Onion that ejects a seed, the game picks a Pikmin to teleport to its Onion to give way for the new seed
2015-11-19 23:07:02	@PikFan	in seriousness though, what makes Pikmin 3 freak out?
2015-11-19 23:07:07	@PikFan	oh, that
2015-11-19 23:07:13	@Espyo	but the game will never pick a Pikmin that is...
2015-11-19 23:07:21	@Espyo	buried, carrying, and a few other unimportant things
2015-11-19 23:07:27	@Espyo	so what if all Pikmin are busy?
2015-11-19 23:07:40	@Espyo	well, you need at least three free Pikmin to open the blue Onion
2015-11-19 23:07:47	@Espyo	and one to open the pink Onion
2015-11-19 23:07:52	@Espyo	so... too bad
2015-11-19 23:07:53	@Espyo	EXCEPT
2015-11-19 23:07:56	Scruffy	But you need one to open the pink
2015-11-19 23:08:07	@Espyo	don't you need three for the flukeweed?
2015-11-19 23:08:17	@PikFan	yeah
2015-11-19 23:08:20	@Espyo	well, either way, you need more than 0
2015-11-19 23:08:32	@Espyo	so by the time you open the Onion, one Pikmin will be free to be teleported
2015-11-19 23:08:34	@Espyo	BUT
2015-11-19 23:08:54	@Espyo	what if you use a bomb rock with a Yellow Pikmin to blow up the Arachnode on the Twilight River
2015-11-19 23:09:05	@Espyo	and then, before the fuse ends, you have the Pikmin carry a nearby pellet?
2015-11-19 23:09:14	@Espyo	that Pikmin is busy, and the other 99 on the area are seeds
2015-11-19 23:09:15	@Espyo	BOOM!
2015-11-19 23:09:19	@Espyo	the game won't be able to pick any
2015-11-19 23:09:22	@PikFan	there is a problem
2015-11-19 23:09:23	Scruffy	Woah
2015-11-19 23:09:24	@Espyo	and I doubt they considered this insane scenario
2015-11-19 23:09:32	@Espyo	only problem is...
2015-11-19 23:09:34	@Espyo	well, it's not a problem
2015-11-19 23:09:38	@PikFan	I don't think there are any nearby pellets, other than the one across the puddle
2015-11-19 23:09:40	@Espyo	but somebody has to sacrifice their save file
2015-11-19 23:09:41	@PikFan	and that's too far
2015-11-19 23:09:45	@Espyo	nope, there's one, I checked
2015-11-19 23:09:49	Scruffy	I volunteer
2015-11-19 23:09:52	@Espyo	Pellet Posies near the pink Onion
2015-11-19 23:10:00	@Espyo	the save file won't be destroyed or anything
2015-11-19 23:10:00	@Espyo	...
2015-11-19 23:10:04	@Espyo	at least I don't THINK so
2015-11-19 23:10:12	@Espyo	the game could brick the console afaik
2015-11-19 23:10:15	@Espyo	...of course it won't
2015-11-19 23:10:20	Yoyo	What if there was a way to make the Pikmin buried just before the cut-scene starts?
2015-11-19 23:10:21	@PikFan	brick the console?
2015-11-19 23:10:23	@Espyo	it likely will just crash
2015-11-19 23:10:31	@Espyo	the thing with the save file
2015-11-19 23:10:36	@Espyo	is that to get 99 seeds on the Twilight River
2015-11-19 23:10:40	@Espyo	you will need more than one day
2015-11-19 23:10:48	@Espyo	and you can only go back one day at a time
2015-11-19 23:10:59	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-11-19 23:11:03	@Espyo	so either you go back to the first day of the Twilight River and replace your save file so you can work the days from there after
2015-11-19 23:11:08	@Espyo	and lose all you had from that day onwards
2015-11-19 23:11:18	@Espyo	or you start a new account on your console and play from the start there
2015-11-19 23:11:27	@Espyo	that's the only thing standing in the way
2015-11-19 23:11:36	@Espyo	and I don't have enough time nor am I willing to throw away my save file for it
2015-11-19 23:11:39	@PikFan	you'd have to build the bridge first, in order to get the bomb rock Pikmin to the Onion
2015-11-19 23:11:41	@Espyo	I need to check stuff in-game all the time
2015-11-19 23:11:49	@Espyo	and having a save file on the Twilight River only is... bad
2015-11-19 23:11:57	@PikFan	eh, I don't mind
2015-11-19 23:11:58	@Espyo	and to open the Onion, period
2015-11-19 23:12:10	Yoyo	I think that it could only happen with the use of hacking.
2015-11-19 23:12:18	@Espyo	no, it's simple
2015-11-19 23:12:23	@Espyo	just spend 4 or 5 days building 99 seeds
2015-11-19 23:12:29	@Espyo	start by delivering large enemies like normal
2015-11-19 23:12:43	@Espyo	and then smaller and smaller things, because you have each time less usable Pikmin and more unplucked seeds
2015-11-19 23:12:52	@Espyo	once you get to 99, which will take like 4 or 5 days
2015-11-19 23:12:58	@Espyo	just get a bomb rock with a yellow from that can
2015-11-19 23:13:00	@Espyo	go to the Onion
2015-11-19 23:13:02	Scruffy	I'm gonna try this
2015-11-19 23:13:05	@Espyo	(oh, build the path to the Onion before it)
2015-11-19 23:13:13	@Espyo	use it on the web
2015-11-19 23:13:15	@Espyo	and go to town
2015-11-19 23:13:16	@PikFan	15:11	PikFan	you'd have to build the bridge first, in order to get the bomb rock Pikmin to the Onion
2015-11-19 23:13:22	@Espyo	right, right
2015-11-19 23:13:25	@Espyo	I tried throwing a bomb rock Pikmin at a web
2015-11-19 23:13:30	@Espyo	and the bomb gets stuck, but the Pikmin comes out
2015-11-19 23:13:39	@Espyo	I think it's tight, but there's enough time to make the Pikmin carry the pellet
2015-11-19 23:13:41	@PikFan	where's the nearby pellet?
2015-11-19 23:13:46	Scruffy	So we're positive that the game will not send back working or buried Pikmin?
2015-11-19 23:13:47	@Espyo	right on the pink base
2015-11-19 23:13:53	@Espyo	pretty much
2015-11-19 23:14:02	@Espyo	me and Phineas scienced some
2015-11-19 23:14:10	@Espyo	I'll update the 100 Pikmin article within the next hours with our findings
2015-11-19 23:14:21	@PikFan	hm
2015-11-19 23:14:26	Scruffy	I will volunteer my save file for science
2015-11-19 23:14:34	@Espyo	or you can create a new account and start from scratch
2015-11-19 23:14:36	@PikFan	what if the devs knew something like this could happen...
2015-11-19 23:14:37	@Espyo	leaving your file intact
2015-11-19 23:14:49	@PikFan	and they made it such that the last Pikmin to start a task gets sent back?
2015-11-19 23:14:50	Yoyo	You can't skip building the bridge, then.
2015-11-19 23:14:52	@Espyo	they're insane enough to have thought of it
2015-11-19 23:15:00	Scruffy	Well it wouldn't corrupt the whole game would it?
2015-11-19 23:15:02	@Espyo	but it'll blow my mind either way, for sure
2015-11-19 23:15:07	@Espyo	it would never corrupt the whole game
2015-11-19 23:15:12	@Espyo	here's what the code likely does:
2015-11-19 23:15:13	@PikFan	...probably
2015-11-19 23:15:22	@Espyo	*sort the Pikmin by distance to the Onion
2015-11-19 23:15:36	@Espyo	*from the farthest to the closest...
2015-11-19 23:15:46	@Espyo	*if this Pikmin can be chosen, then set "chosen Pikmin" to this one
2015-11-19 23:15:49	@Espyo	*if not, skip to the next one
2015-11-19 23:15:57	@Espyo	*send "chosen Pikmin" to the Onion
2015-11-19 23:16:14	@Espyo	what if you do that "from farthest to closest" check all the way through and NEVER set "chosen Pikmin"?
2015-11-19 23:16:17	@Espyo	because none of them are apt?
2015-11-19 23:16:26	@Espyo	then when it's time to send "chosen Pikmin" to the Onion...
2015-11-19 23:16:29	@Espyo	that Pikmin will be NULL
2015-11-19 23:16:33	@Espyo	a NULL-pointer error?
2015-11-19 23:16:41	@Espyo	probably the most trivial error besides divide-by-zero
2015-11-19 23:16:46	@Espyo	the Wii U DEFINITELY has safeguards against that
2015-11-19 23:16:59	Scruffy	But what, is the question
2015-11-19 23:16:59	@PikFan	what if it doesn't
2015-11-19 23:17:06	@Espyo	it'll likely crash
2015-11-19 23:17:09	@Espyo	a program would crash
2015-11-19 23:17:17	@Espyo	and show a warning that there's an uncaught exception
