2017-04-13 21:04:43	@Espyo	so it'll be a really nice game to play then

2017-04-16 12:55:55	@Espyo	and bad
2017-04-16 12:56:07	@Espyo	you've got progress, but you're assuming that they're not lunatics
2017-04-16 14:21:03	Yoshi2	it is very risky but I think it might be worth the risk
2017-04-16 14:21:09	Yoshi2	so far I've had some success
2017-04-16 14:21:20	Yoshi2	similar header means data starts at a similar spot

2017-04-16 16:03:23	Yoshi2	sigh, I wanted to charge my notebook using a power strip and now the entire room doesn't have electricity
2017-04-16 16:03:34	Yoshi2	thankfully the notebook charger is fine
2017-04-16 16:05:39	@Espyo	:|
2017-04-16 16:06:09	Yoshi2	but I guess the power strip is bad
2017-04-16 16:06:24	Yoshi2	how do I get electricity again though... o.ô
2017-04-16 16:06:55	@Espyo	turn on the circuit breaker?
2017-04-16 16:07:56	Yoshi2	I've checked the thing out and not sure which switches I should turn on :I
2017-04-16 16:08:11	@Espyo	they're usually labelled...
2017-04-16 16:11:46	Yoshi2	with weird numbers and there is some sort of attempt at labelling
2017-04-16 16:11:57	Yoshi2	I guess I'll have my dad do this when he's back
2017-04-16 16:11:59	@Espyo	yikes
2017-04-16 16:12:05	@Espyo	well, which switch is the opposite way from the others?
2017-04-16 16:13:58	Yoshi2	only those that are unused
2017-04-16 16:14:20	@Espyo	how do you know they're unused?
2017-04-16 16:14:29	Yoshi2	by the labelling
2017-04-16 16:14:30	@Espyo	I thought the labelling was in hieroglyphs
2017-04-16 16:14:41	Yoshi2	there are labels for the light in the room and that one is on On
2017-04-16 16:14:45	Yoshi2	strangely
2017-04-16 16:15:13	@Espyo	well one of them has to be it...
2017-04-16 16:43:15	Yoshi2	ok it was the one I didn't pay attention to
2017-04-16 19:11:39	Yoshi2	i got distracted by my sudden idea to make AW/BW related emojis for discord
2017-04-16 19:22:58	@Espyo	do it
2017-04-16 19:23:09	@Espyo	all the cool kids are doing it

2017-04-16 20:10:28	Yoshi2	we AW too now because one of our members sent the invite to some AW people
2017-04-16 20:13:27	@Espyo	that's not a bad idea
2017-04-16 20:16:11	Yoshi2	yup
2017-04-16 20:19:29	Yoshi2	heard the AW community hasn't been in the best shape lately, might as well try to pick up whoever's interested
2017-04-16 20:19:57	@Espyo	yeah
2017-04-16 20:37:38	Yoshi2	on a discord I'm on somebody posted a strawpoll about whether cursing should be allowed or not (the discord has a no cursing rule)
2017-04-16 21:32:59	Yoshi2	now i didn't get any work done on the file format

2017-04-21 18:45:16	Testyo	Evening everyone!
2017-04-21 18:50:17	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-04-21 18:50:17	Testyo	Reminds me of a playlist I suppose that is true, Espyo-yo
2017-04-21 18:51:32	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-21 20:59:01	Yoshi2	I still haven't done that pikmin thing I wanted to do
2017-04-21 21:02:33	@Espyo	ah yes
2017-04-21 21:02:35	@Espyo	the Pikmin thing
2017-04-21 21:14:18	Yoshi2	ok I did the pikmin thing now
2017-04-21 21:17:00	@Espyo	ah yes
2017-04-21 21:17:02	@Espyo	the Pikmin thing
2017-04-21 21:17:10	@Espyo	good on you for doing it
2017-04-21 21:17:22	Yoshi2	you see
2017-04-21 21:17:25	Yoshi2	it's very important
2017-04-21 21:22:09	Yoshi2	what I wanted to do is confirm where the edge data starts based on some header data
2017-04-21 21:22:16	Yoshi2	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291956181554167808/305075436881182721/unknown.png
2017-04-21 21:22:43	Yoshi2	if that particular value has its first bit set (number is uneven), it starts at 0x58, otherwise it starts at 0x38
2017-04-21 21:22:49	@Espyo	wow
2017-04-21 21:22:52	@Espyo	figured out WHY?
2017-04-21 21:23:00	@Espyo	how did you even figure it out, damn you?
2017-04-21 21:23:10	@Espyo	that's so specific and random
2017-04-21 21:23:16	Yoshi2	pray to nyanmoto
2017-04-21 21:23:56	Yoshi2	and weeks of doing jack with the format, then coming back to it and "oh, maybe this is more simple than expected"
2017-04-21 21:24:11	Yoshi2	also lots of comparing different files and seeing patterns
2017-04-21 21:24:47	Yoshi2	did I mention that i wrote a script that reads all the files and groups them by header, storing the results in a json file
2017-04-21 21:27:20	Yoshi2	when I did that I thought "hmm, I should compare files that have the same header/subheader"
2017-04-21 21:27:48	Yoshi2	and I realized same subheader results in edge data starting at the same offset
2017-04-21 21:44:54	@Espyo	good grief, man
2017-04-21 22:00:51	Yoshi2	next step is finding a correlation between the format of the edge data and the header data
2017-04-21 22:01:02	Yoshi2	g'night
2017-04-21 22:08:31	@Espyo	night

2017-04-22 13:13:13	Testyo	I was going to play Pikmin 3, so yep, I'm thinking it would have an ethereal like appearance
2017-04-22 13:13:46	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-22 13:32:16	Yoshi2	Espyo: progress on the format: Variant 1 of the edge data: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/212795100818833408/305271163960164353/unknown.png

2017-04-22 13:33:30	@Espyo	ah, I see
2017-04-22 13:33:41	@Espyo	I don't suppose you've figured out WHY there are two variants yet, have you?
2017-04-22 13:51:06	Yoshi2	do you 
2017-04-22 13:51:18	Yoshi2	oops
2017-04-22 14:07:07	Yoshi2	my theory is that maybe one format is used for more complex models but not sure
2017-04-22 17:34:41	Yoshi2	actually idk
2017-04-22 17:34:59	Yoshi2	the additional data in the header is almost always 0x00 so *shrug*

2017-04-23 09:23:59	Yoshi2	J: I've got a bit of trouble with building pikmin 2 using your gcedit code here I think http://i.imgur.com/fxCQklH.png
2017-04-23 09:27:22	Yoshi2	I hooked some print code into the place where it encodes the name now
2017-04-23 09:27:25	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/xHDNFrx.png
2017-04-23 09:29:05	Yoshi2	I wonder what encoding that is
2017-04-23 10:15:04	@J	yeah, that's weird
2017-04-23 10:15:13	@J	when doing it I just assumed shift-JIS really, since it seemed to work
2017-04-23 10:15:38	@J	strange that your disk seems to have a file with a bad name when mine doesn't?
2017-04-23 10:15:43	@J	or is this a file you added?
2017-04-23 10:16:17	@J	this is user/Abe/map/newtest/nonloop?
2017-04-23 10:17:56	Yoshi2	it's a file that was there already, though I dumped this with gcrebuilder. Maybe that messed things up
2017-04-23 10:18:46	Yoshi2	the file shows up fine in dolphin so I'll try dumping it with dolphin
2017-04-23 10:19:02	@J	what do you mean, why would dumping change the disk contents?
2017-04-23 10:19:10	@J	or you're reimporting what you dumped?
2017-04-23 10:19:34	Yoshi2	maybe gcrebuilder messed up the filename encoding
2017-04-23 10:19:46	@J	0-0.txt

2017-04-23 10:19:52	@J	this is what I see
2017-04-23 10:20:37	@J	yeah, but surely gcrebuilder would only mess up the name of the file outside the ISO
2017-04-23 10:20:51	@J	so I can only see that being a problem if you then tried to import that file again
2017-04-23 10:21:09	@J	dumping wouldn't change the files in the ISO, right?
2017-04-23 10:22:20	@J	none of those is 0192 BTW
2017-04-23 10:22:34	@J	"name": "\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc (2) \u301c 0-0.txt" "name": "\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc \u301c 0-0.txt" "name": "\uff17\u7a2e\uff11\uff10\u672c0-0.txt"
2017-04-23 10:24:28	Yoshi2	ok gcrebuilder did mess it up I think
2017-04-23 10:24:37	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/c5NguXl.png left is dumped with dolphin, right is dumped with gcrebuilder
2017-04-23 10:26:18	@J	ah, yeah
2017-04-23 10:26:43	@J	Dolphin dump works then?
2017-04-23 10:27:50	Yoshi2	hmm noooope
2017-04-23 10:27:52	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/0SIOXiC.png
2017-04-23 10:34:01	@J	if it is the same order, that's the middle file I pasted "\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc \u301c 0-0.txt"
2017-04-23 10:34:09	@J	shouldn't have ff5e
2017-04-23 10:35:12	@J	I can try doing the same
2017-04-23 10:38:02	@J	it worked perfectly fine
2017-04-23 10:38:29	@J	I dumped the whole thing, then did: gcedit-cli import -f Pikmin\ 2.iso pikmin\ 2/user user
2017-04-23 10:39:30	@J	so I blame the Windows filesystem
2017-04-23 10:40:14	Yoshi2	are you on linux?
2017-04-23 10:40:16	@J	yeah
2017-04-23 10:41:13	@J	try in Python 3: import sys / sys.getdefaultencoding()
2017-04-23 10:41:26	@J	uh, wait
2017-04-23 10:41:38	@J	sys.getfilesystemencoding()
2017-04-23 10:41:39	@J	that one
2017-04-23 10:42:02	Yoshi2	utf 8
2017-04-23 10:42:29	Yoshi2	I did a hex(ord(x)) for x in name over every string and got this: http://i.imgur.com/bQMA8BQ.png
2017-04-23 10:43:15	Yoshi2	what the heck is this ff5e
2017-04-23 10:44:01	@J	instead of my 301c, you have 5 whole characters
2017-04-23 10:44:53	@J	highly suspicious: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ff5e/index.htm http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/301c/index.htm
2017-04-23 10:45:13	@J	who is converting one of those into the other
2017-04-23 10:46:56	Yoshi2	hmmm
2017-04-23 10:49:19	@J	unfortunately I didn't add an export into the gcedit CLI or we could compare
2017-04-23 10:49:35	@J	if the GUI works when you don't move the window you could try that
2017-04-23 10:53:04	Yoshi2	ok I used os.listdir and it's 0xFF5e for me
2017-04-23 10:53:41	Yoshi2	the one in abe\map\newtest\nonloop
2017-04-23 10:55:49	@J	what happens if you use Python 3 to write to a file with name '\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc (2) \u301c 0-0.txt'
2017-04-23 10:56:00	@J	then listdir
2017-04-23 11:02:16	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/v5jHDub.png seems to be fine, it stays a 0x301c
2017-04-23 11:02:41	Yoshi2	so I guess dolphin messed this one up
2017-04-23 11:07:42	Yoshi2	time for a HackyMcHack fix
2017-04-23 11:07:44	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/cEgazRJ.png
2017-04-23 11:07:46	@J	or maybe Dolphin is right and my list is showing the wrong thing
2017-04-23 11:07:54	@J	wooow
2017-04-23 11:08:05	@J	I was just quickly adding dump to gcedit-cli
2017-04-23 11:08:27	Yoshi2	ah, heh
2017-04-23 11:08:50	Yoshi2	when your dump feature is ready I can try it
2017-04-23 11:12:28	Yoshi2	but if my dolphin made a 0x55FE and 55FE is not part of shiftjis then 55FE can't be right 
2017-04-23 11:18:30	@J	unless it's just not shift-JIS
2017-04-23 11:19:48	@J	well, this seems to work, except it crashes if you don't use overwrite and the destination exists

2017-04-23 11:41:59	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-04-23 11:42:00	Testyo	Its the perfect blend of quality, with cheesiness
2017-04-23 11:42:31	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-23 12:42:28	Yoshi2	sighhh my supposedly custom bmd isn't appearing ingame, that sucks
2017-04-23 12:46:44	@Espyo	damn
2017-04-23 12:49:50	Yoshi2	i want to yell at the developer
2017-04-23 12:50:14	Yoshi2	YOUR CONVERTER DOESN'T EVEN MAKE BMDS THAT RENDER 
2017-04-23 12:50:35	Yoshi2	they don't render in bmdview2 which is a red flag
2017-04-23 12:51:11	Yoshi2	they kinda render in j3d model viewer but with flipped axis and much smaller than they should be
2017-04-23 12:51:29	Yoshi2	and crash in j3dview
2017-04-23 12:54:06	Yoshi2	and it's fine, sometimes stuff doesn't work so well
2017-04-23 12:54:23	Yoshi2	except this developer stopped work on that converter and made a new one that uses dae files
2017-04-23 12:54:44	Yoshi2	which doesn't even convert the dae files
2017-04-23 12:55:19	@Espyo	haha
2017-04-23 12:55:27	@Espyo	yeah, pretty much
2017-04-23 12:56:59	Yoshi2	with the current progress I bet the dev will cancel the dae program
2017-04-23 12:57:01	Yoshi2	and make a new one
2017-04-23 12:58:32	@Espyo	mhm
2017-04-23 12:58:37	Yoshi2	and it will go like this https://youtu.be/w2ZX_ToJHFk?t=8m45s
2017-04-23 12:59:23	@Espyo	aah, a classic
2017-04-23 13:01:26	Yoshi2	the 2nd iteration of the program makes files that don't work
2017-04-23 13:01:41	Yoshi2	the 3rd iteration of the program crashes on conversion
2017-04-23 13:01:53	Yoshi2	the 4th iteration of the BMD converter, you start the program and your pc just explodes
2017-04-23 13:02:23	Yoshi2	and the 5th iteration will be a bag of shit saying "Definite Universal BMDCubed Converter"
2017-04-23 13:02:29	@Espyo	lol
2017-04-23 15:11:24	Testyo	Hows my got spooked
2017-04-23 15:11:54	@Espyo	spoopy
2017-04-23 15:21:13	Yoshi2	Hahahahahaha i tried a different bmd converter which worked a bit better but still not working ingame hahahahhaha
2017-04-23 15:22:37	@Espyo	no hope :)

2017-04-23 22:03:19	Yoshi2	to fix this I'd need to read into how the fuck bmd models work

2017-04-28 12:38:57	@Espyo	since a couple of months ago
2017-04-28 12:38:59	@Espyo	gonna move out

2017-04-28 12:39:28	@Espyo	but my parents need a bigger house to store all the materials and tools the use for handcraft work

2017-04-28 18:27:53	@Espyo	WHO EVEN LIKES 3DSMAX?
2017-04-28 18:30:56	Yoshi2	Espyo: and now the best part:
2017-04-28 18:31:07	Yoshi2	I've used 3dsmax to export the model as a dae file
2017-04-28 18:31:10	Yoshi2	and the converter
2017-04-28 18:31:13	Yoshi2	STILL BREAKS
2017-04-28 18:31:37	@Espyo	brilliant
2017-04-28 18:31:48	Yoshi2	exact same exception too
2017-04-28 18:33:52	Yoshi2	there might be something I am misunderstanding but uh
2017-04-28 18:34:07	Yoshi2	"currently supports static meshes with 0 bones and simple skinned meshes"
2017-04-28 18:34:18	Yoshi2	sounds like I should be able to throw any dae file at it and have it work

2017-04-28 19:52:56	@Espyo	definitely
2017-04-28 19:53:10	@Espyo	though this dev is so barely a dev, I doubt they'll even understand what a glitch is :B
2017-04-28 20:38:03	Yoshi2	I realized something, .dae files are just renamed xml
2017-04-28 20:40:29	@Espyo	awesome proprietary formats
2017-04-28 20:44:10	Yoshi2	untitled said something about the converter being designed to work with 3ds max dae files
2017-04-28 20:44:21	Yoshi2	neither works for me though lmao
2017-04-28 20:44:32	Yoshi2	it would be the biggest comedy ever

2017-05-02 19:07:00	Testyo	Greetings everyone!
2017-05-02 19:28:05	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-05-02 19:28:05	Testyo	but in a single file, it's a good watch
2017-05-02 19:28:54	@Espyo	hi
2017-05-02 20:03:41	Yoshi2	https://i.imgur.com/kHAMuXC.jpg
2017-05-02 20:04:37	@Espyo	pffft
2017-05-02 20:14:56	Yoshi2	telegram also has that water gun because it uses the ios emojis even on android
2017-05-02 20:15:34	@Espyo	oh, heh
2017-05-02 20:15:59	Yoshi2	discord on desktop has a real gun
2017-05-02 20:16:13	Yoshi2	on mobile it has the mobile phone's respective emojis (right now)
2017-05-02 20:17:14	@Espyo	right, I'd imagine that it just uses the phone's emoji whenever possible

2017-05-02 20:44:18	Yoshi2	Espyo: did you know
2017-05-02 20:44:25	Yoshi2	the gamecube has an l1 and a l2 cache
2017-05-02 20:44:51	Yoshi2	and there are cached writes (done with 0x80000000) and uncached writes (done with 0xC0000000)
2017-05-02 20:45:16	Yoshi2	*reads/writes
2017-05-02 20:45:54	Yoshi2	and dolphin doesn't emulate the cache so all reads/writes are uncached
2017-05-02 20:46:05	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2017-05-02 20:46:08	@Espyo	I've read about that today
2017-05-02 20:46:12	@Espyo	in the Dolphin progress report
2017-05-02 20:46:15	@Espyo	so yeah, I know ;)
2017-05-02 20:49:13	Yoshi2	the dolphin progress report has something about cached/uncached writes? Huh
2017-05-02 20:50:24	@Espyo	huh? is that not where you knew this info from?
2017-05-02 20:51:23	@Espyo	https://pt.dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/05/02/dolphin-progress-report-april-2017/
2017-05-02 20:51:31	@Espyo	scroll down to 5.0-3489
2017-05-02 20:53:17	Yoshi2	that talks about a cache for the conditional registers because the gamecube has 8 of those while ARM and x86 only have 1
2017-05-02 20:53:30	Yoshi2	no mention of L1 or L2 or cached or uncached read/writes
2017-05-02 20:53:34	@Espyo	ah, I see
2017-05-02 20:53:38	@Espyo	so it's not the same thing
2017-05-02 20:53:38	@Espyo	sorry
2017-05-02 20:53:47	Yoshi2	don't bamboozle me like that o-o
2017-05-02 20:53:59	Yoshi2	anyway, what I wanted to say is
2017-05-02 20:54:30	Yoshi2	according to arookas there are some sdk demos that don't run in dolphin because they rely on uncached read/writes being different from cached
2017-05-02 20:54:53	Yoshi2	under some conditions the same address could hold different values because one value is in the cache and the other is in the actual ram
2017-05-02 20:55:36	@Espyo	ouch, yeah
2017-05-02 20:55:49	Yoshi2	luckily, no game relies on that behaviour
2017-05-02 23:03:18	Testyo	OR DOING HAHAHA

2017-05-03 22:21:18	Yoshi2	and conditional jumps
2017-05-03 22:21:37	@Espyo	more lit than assembly, then
2017-05-03 22:23:44	Yoshi2	and there is a printf opcode that, if it isn't disabled, prints stuff to the debug output

2017-05-03 22:24:00	@Espyo	oh, nice
2017-05-03 22:24:11	@Espyo	that has to come in handy
2017-05-03 22:24:27	Yoshi2	in pikmin 2 it is disabled
2017-05-03 22:24:35	Yoshi2	in the wind waker it isn't

2017-05-04 19:31:41	Yoshi2	yup
2017-05-04 19:31:52	Yoshi2	and the nintendo devs were even crazier than we thought
2017-05-04 19:32:01	Yoshi2	BMS files can contain inlined data
2017-05-04 19:32:12	Yoshi2	you won't even be able to tell it apart from opcodes

2017-05-04 19:32:41	@Espyo	at a glance
2017-05-04 19:33:59	Yoshi2	it's awesome but also means disassembling existing bms files is a pain
2017-05-04 19:34:09	Yoshi2	or needs to be done manually
2017-05-04 19:36:36	Yoshi2	did I mention bms has opcodes for choosing a random number and conditional jumps?
2017-05-04 19:37:33	@Espyo	you did
2017-05-04 19:37:39	@Espyo	this just gets better and better
2017-05-04 19:37:45	@Espyo	it was meant to be a music format
2017-05-04 19:37:50	@Espyo	it's closer to being an OS at this rate
2017-05-04 19:38:52	Yoshi2	yup
2017-05-04 19:39:03	Yoshi2	you can make a small bms file that loops through all banks and program

2017-05-05 20:43:48	@Espyo	hi
2017-05-05 21:07:16	Yoshi2	today I had a talk about whether bms is turing complete and I guess strictly speaking it isn't
2017-05-05 21:07:38	Yoshi2	but it is probably turing equivalent to some machine with a few bytes of ram or so
2017-05-05 21:33:12	@Espyo	I never expected to hear those words

2017-05-05 23:10:12	Yoshi2	ok so the fun is

2017-05-05 23:29:08	@Espyo	this is where I'd laugh and point at you for using C++

2017-05-08 21:04:35	Yoshi2	ah
2017-05-08 21:05:15	Yoshi2	did you buy the bright pink inflatable flamingo for pool use?
2017-05-08 21:05:45	@Espyo	not yet
2017-05-08 21:05:49	@Espyo	still too cold for pools :(
2017-05-08 21:33:26	Yoshi2	today i asked the dev about progress on the problem
2017-05-08 21:34:08	Yoshi2	his response was
2017-05-08 21:34:12	Yoshi2	"uhh"
2017-05-08 21:43:37	@Espyo	sounds like my type of progress
2017-05-08 22:03:55	Yoshi2	I pestered him once more
2017-05-08 22:04:16	Yoshi2	his solution was to force the CultureInfo for the duration of the program to en-US
2017-05-08 22:04:28	Yoshi2	hacky, but it works  👀 
2017-05-08 22:05:44	@Espyo	wow
2017-05-08 22:05:50	@Espyo	well, yeah...
2017-05-08 22:06:09	@Espyo	wait, what language is this?
2017-05-08 22:08:53	@Espyo	because I've had to struggle with locale nonsense in the past

2017-05-08 22:10:09	Yoshi2	c#
2017-05-08 22:10:38	Yoshi2	does s2f handle string to float conversion?

2017-05-08 22:10:49	@Espyo	yep
2017-05-08 22:10:51	Yoshi2	the issue I had was also about strings to floats 
2017-05-08 22:11:03	@Espyo	yeah, seems like a standard problem then

2017-05-09 21:30:21	@Espyo	ok, so
2017-05-09 21:30:34	@Espyo	there's a formula that calculates the highest point in a trajectory
2017-05-09 21:30:42	@Espyo	I decided to use that to calculate how high each Pikmin can be thrown
2017-05-09 21:30:46	@Espyo	it works... kind of
2017-05-09 21:31:02	@Espyo	the value is one thing, but when you actually throw the Pikmin, it can reach Z values higher than that
2017-05-09 21:31:06	@Espyo	after struggling for a while, I realized why
2017-05-09 21:31:23	@Espyo	floating point errors and framerates
2017-05-09 21:31:58	@Espyo	ran a quick simulation, and https://pastebin.com/ZXs6t8NR
2017-05-09 21:32:59	@Espyo	makes sense: at 1 FPS, you throw the Pikmin with the strength of 1188 pixels per second
2017-05-09 21:33:07	@Espyo	it changes the Z for one second's worth
2017-05-09 21:33:10	@Espyo	Z = 1188
2017-05-09 21:33:18	@Espyo	then applies the gravity
2017-05-09 21:33:26	@Espyo	throws the speed right back down
2017-05-09 21:33:58	Yoshi2	physics tied to framerates reeeeee
2017-05-09 21:35:16	@Espyo	I KNOW!
2017-05-09 21:35:20	@Espyo	d-don't judge me :(
2017-05-09 21:35:36	@Espyo	it seemed good on paper
2017-05-09 21:36:38	@Espyo	the bad part is that I figured 60fps would be pretty negligible
2017-05-09 21:36:45	@Espyo	but it's a full 10 units off-mark
2017-05-09 21:37:09	@Espyo	well, good thing I only want the maximum value for an estimate
2017-05-09 21:37:25	@Espyo	and plus, if you're worried about exact heights on the engine, something's wrong with you
2017-05-09 21:37:32	@Espyo	the engine, or any other top-down game
2017-05-09 21:37:38	@Espyo	that isn't a simulation

2017-05-20 12:42:45	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2017-05-20 15:12:38	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-05-20 15:12:39	Testyo	If a treasure makes it to the ship or an item to the Onion during a cutscene, the Pikmin just drop it and then pick it up once the cutscene is done
2017-05-20 15:14:08	@Espyo	hi
2017-05-20 15:17:12	Yoshi2	working on a phone background https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291956181554167808/315491847885815808/unknown.png
2017-05-20 15:19:49	@Espyo	hm, it clashes kinda oddly
2017-05-20 15:20:04	@Espyo	but you can probably tamper with the girl's colors around to make it look great
2017-05-20 15:20:12	@Espyo	but that's color theory — I'm no good at it
2017-05-20 15:20:35	Yoshi2	the girl is untouchable
2017-05-20 15:20:49	Yoshi2	would probably rather change the background  👀
2017-05-20 15:20:57	@Espyo	in that case, yeah, change the background
2017-05-20 17:06:51	Yoshi2	ok in the end I decided the girl was too bright and I darkened her https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/274726662409682944/315520548308385792/Screenshot_20170520-180522.png
2017-05-20 17:07:09	@Espyo	well well, looks like she is touchable after all
2017-05-20 17:07:23	@Espyo	you could almost grab what I said out of context, but not quite
2017-05-20 17:07:28	Yoshi2	yup
2017-05-20 17:07:38	@Espyo	anyway yeah, I think it works better, but you can probably be more bold and make her a bit darker and bluer
2017-05-20 17:07:45	@Espyo	I really feel like a slight tint of blue would work
2017-05-20 17:07:52	@Espyo	or maybe some blueish green?
2017-05-20 17:08:27	Yoshi2	hmm
2017-05-20 17:17:09	Yoshi2	I could try a thing but I'm afraid it could be too dark
2017-05-20 17:17:20	Yoshi2	I'm already getting a desaturated feel from the pic on my phone
2017-05-20 17:18:37	@Espyo	color experts say desaturation isn't a bad thing *shrug*
2017-05-20 17:18:48	@Espyo	plus, you probably want something desaturated for a phone background anyway
2017-05-20 17:24:39	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/v7yUpEu.png is this too dark/too much hue?
2017-05-20 17:25:04	@Espyo	see, that's the thing
2017-05-20 17:25:09	@Espyo	you can clearly see that this isn't natural lighting
2017-05-20 17:25:13	@Espyo	but it's pretty darn perfect with the setting
2017-05-20 17:25:21	@Espyo	if you just look at the girl by herself, it looks horribly dark
2017-05-20 17:25:26	@Espyo	but if you consider the entire picture, it looks great
2017-05-20 17:25:32	@Espyo	maaaaaaaaybe tone it down just a smidge?
2017-05-20 17:25:36	@Espyo	it might actually be too aggressive
2017-05-20 17:25:45	@Espyo	but if that were the final product, I'd give it a thumbs up
2017-05-20 17:25:50	@Espyo	it looks so much better, man
2017-05-20 17:38:31	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/NurMJ2F.png hmmm
2017-05-20 17:42:02	@Espyo	bring back some of the blue, though just a bit, and make it less dark
2017-05-20 17:42:04	@Espyo	and I think it's perfect
2017-05-20 17:45:12	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/qWyKeY6.png brightness is up to 0 now (was -15 in the previous one) and I turned up the hue a bit
2017-05-20 17:45:22	Yoshi2	hmmm
2017-05-20 17:48:48	@Espyo	I think that's it
2017-05-20 17:48:57	@Espyo	I'd wear it around as a phone background for a bit
2017-05-20 17:49:06	@Espyo	because right now, you and I are in that mindset where we KNOW it's colored
2017-05-20 17:49:16	@Espyo	but after using it for a while, like a week, I think it'll start to feel natural
2017-05-20 17:49:34	@Espyo	and then you can actually tell if it still looks artificially colored, or if it just looks like it's under perfect lighting
2017-05-20 17:52:56	Yoshi2	alrighttt, this will stay then
2017-05-20 18:19:19	Yoshi2	mmm somebody I know asked for a copy of the wallpaper 👀 
2017-05-20 18:19:38	@Espyo	that means it's good!
2017-05-20 18:23:20	Yoshi2	apparently so
2017-05-20 18:30:47	Yoshi2	let's celebrate it with a dank meme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9_tqNAKemU
2017-05-20 18:32:03	@Espyo	hah
2017-05-20 18:32:16	@Espyo	I think this is the first time I've seen this moment with sound AND with the cover edited
2017-05-20 18:32:16	@Espyo	 10/10
2017-05-20 18:37:39	Yoshi2	definitely a perfect 10
2017-05-20 20:37:42	Yoshi2	watching a stream of somebody playing as toon link in super mario sunshine
2017-05-20 20:38:03	@Espyo	wait what
2017-05-20 20:40:35	Yoshi2	bmdcubed supports models with bones
2017-05-20 20:43:41	Yoshi2	so I think they took the toon link model, weighted the vertices for the bones and then converted it

2017-05-25 19:04:17	Marty2000	Been playing Zelda Breath of the Wild

2017-05-25 19:08:12	Marty2000	I kind of want to go back to searching for such stuff in Pikmin
2017-05-25 19:08:20	Marty2000	I just don't know where to begin though
2017-05-25 19:11:25	Marty2000	Recorded the glitch
2017-05-25 19:11:42	Marty2000	basically, you can parry with Daruk's protection but it costs no use
2017-05-25 19:12:15	Marty2000	while it should cost a use whenever you parry an attack with it
2017-05-25 19:12:40	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo & MARTYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
2017-05-25 19:12:40	Testyo	Katie posted that to me earlier in the real world, even if it's just for existing

2017-05-25 19:14:24	@Espyo	hi

2017-05-25 19:14:50	Marty2000	Oh, whoops
2017-05-25 19:14:53	Marty2000	thought you knew

2017-05-25 19:16:26	Marty2000	When did you get the game, Espyo?
2017-05-25 19:16:53	@Espyo	right, I don't think you're aware of my epic chronicle
2017-05-25 19:16:57	@Espyo	give me a second
2017-05-25 19:17:02	Marty2000	I am not
2017-05-25 19:18:08	@Espyo	https://pastebin.com/diEPJZ4N
2017-05-25 19:18:22	@Espyo	this is what happened between the day I bought it, and today
2017-05-25 19:20:10	Marty2000	I... see. Bad luck :/ Hopefully there'll be no more problems with it
2017-05-25 19:21:24	@Espyo	horrible luck
2017-05-25 19:21:30	@Espyo	it was already bad enough that I didn't get the game right at the start
2017-05-25 19:21:38	@Espyo	it was just horrible that it had to go to repairs
2017-05-25 19:21:48	@Espyo	...it was just UNTHINKABLE that it had to go TWICE
2017-05-25 19:21:50	@Espyo	ugh
2017-05-25 19:21:55	@Espyo	so far, everything seems okay, at least...
2017-05-25 19:22:05	@Espyo	there was a graphical glitch some days ago, but I think that that was actually my TV acting up
2017-05-25 19:22:13	@Espyo	I'm so scared of something happening again...
2017-05-25 19:22:21	@Espyo	I don't trust a motherboard replacement to be the only solution
2017-05-25 19:54:05	Yoshi2	oh rip
2017-05-25 20:11:34	Marty2000	"08/04/2017 - Zelda problems started, 40 hours of gameplay in" Did you have to restart the game after getting the console back? :/
2017-05-25 20:12:02	@Espyo	thankfully, no
2017-05-25 20:12:06	@Espyo	they managed to keep my save files
2017-05-25 20:12:30	@Espyo	also the problems were that it kept crashing with an unknown error, and sometimes even had glitched sections of the screen

2017-05-26 18:53:58	Testyo	Ohai everyone!
2017-05-26 18:57:00	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2017-05-26 18:57:00	Testyo	but I guess you're weirded out
2017-05-26 18:59:23	@Espyo	hi
2017-05-26 18:59:30	@Espyo	guess what, we do have SOME science to do atm
2017-05-26 18:59:39	Marty2000	Nice
2017-05-26 18:59:45	Marty2000	What is it?
2017-05-26 18:59:48	@Espyo	Glutton's Kitchen 6, sometimes the egg treasure spawns inside or near the ham treasure
2017-05-26 18:59:51	@Espyo	which sends the egg treasure flying
2017-05-26 18:59:56	@Espyo	sometimes out of reachable bounds
2017-05-26 19:00:02	@Espyo	and lately, it's been happening a lot to runners
2017-05-26 19:00:15	@Espyo	if you check the recent changes on the wiki, I've linked some 3 videos
2017-05-26 19:00:18	Marty2000	Oh, that's weird. It's never happened to me
2017-05-26 19:00:22	@Espyo	yeah
2017-05-26 19:00:23	Marty2000	Right
2017-05-26 19:00:27	Marty2000	Going to check
2017-05-26 19:00:28	@Espyo	and it's only started happening like this year or something
2017-05-26 19:00:32	@Espyo	but runners have been running the game for years now
2017-05-26 19:00:36	@Espyo	so it's pretty darn weird
2017-05-26 19:00:38	@Espyo	but still
2017-05-26 19:00:49	@Espyo	I want to one day enter the area and see with free-cam exactly what's happening up-close
2017-05-26 19:01:04	@Espyo	I also want to edit the game's files to spawn the two treasures together, or slightly underground, to see what happens
2017-05-26 19:01:22	@Espyo	but I've got the engine's release soon, and planning for my trip to Manchester this Tuesday
2017-05-26 19:01:26	@Espyo	so it's hard to find time to do that
2017-05-26 19:03:41	Marty2000	Well, if you want, I can try to do that by entering sublevel 6 and resetting until it happens, and then I can record it. But that's really the only thing I can do :P
2017-05-26 19:03:52	Marty2000	That won't provide any explanation
2017-05-26 19:04:11	@Espyo	yeah...
2017-05-26 19:04:13	@Espyo	you can try
2017-05-26 19:04:16	Marty2000	Still, that's cool, I'm surprised "nobody" really ever noticed that before
2017-05-26 19:04:18	@Espyo	maybe you can get a different result
2017-05-26 19:04:21	@Espyo	or a different treasure
2017-05-26 19:04:25	Marty2000	That's true
2017-05-26 19:04:25	@Espyo	but I doubt anything will happen
2017-05-26 19:04:31	@Espyo	still, if you want to try, I won't stop you :P
2017-05-26 19:06:07	Marty2000	Yep
2017-05-26 19:07:52	Marty2000	Totally unrelated, but I still hope a Pikmin 4 will be announced for the Switch. While having a new Pikmin on 3DS is still nice, it looks really different from the others, which is also good, but I want another Pikmin with the "traditional" formula
2017-05-26 19:08:21	Marty2000	(and with new glitches, of course)
2017-05-26 19:14:09	@Espyo	yeah
2017-05-26 19:14:14	@Espyo	very likely will

2017-05-27 12:22:49	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-05-27 12:22:50	Testyo	I could tell from the model of the Yellow Wollywog that the animators used animation drivers, not sure about En_Passant, though
2017-05-27 12:22:55	@Espyo	hi
2017-05-27 12:24:08	Yoshi2	J: something like gcedit-cli but for Wii games would be absolutely amazing
2017-05-27 12:24:54	Yoshi2	wiimms iso tools is slow at rebuilding :/

2017-05-27 12:53:52	Yoshi2	or rather, it was put together with the challenges channel
2017-05-27 13:02:49	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2.
2017-05-27 13:02:52	Marty2000	Cool, I'll check it out
2017-05-27 13:05:31	Yoshi2	doesn't have much glitches at the moment but posting glitches is officially allowed there
2017-05-27 13:17:50	@Espyo	ARMS Testpunch currently underway
2017-05-27 14:31:16	Testyo	love. neat
2017-05-27 17:29:04	@J	yeah, I know
2017-05-27 17:29:22	@J	I looked at how different Wii stuff is a while back
2017-05-27 17:29:33	@J	turns out it's basically the same format, but with multiple partitions, and partitions are encrypted
2017-05-27 17:34:39	Testyo	hm, what I did

2017-05-28 19:16:17	Yoshi2	all the pikmin hackers are scrubs so i'm giving up on pikmin hacking and going over to sunshine hacking
2017-05-28 19:24:50	@Espyo	RIP the dream
2017-05-28 19:50:07	Yoshi2	J: is it possible to change the dol of a gamecube game with gcedit-cli? I think the dol is separate from the regular file structure so I'm not sure how to do that

2017-05-28 20:51:01	@J	no, you can't
2017-05-28 20:51:30	@J	if you look at the gcutil.py file, I think there's a method to extract it
2017-05-28 20:51:38	@J	so you could probably work out how to write it using that
2017-05-28 20:52:02	@J	or, if you know the address and size, you can overwrite it pretty easily without much code
2017-05-28 20:56:41	Yoshi2	mhm, I see
2017-05-28 20:58:00	Yoshi2	whelp, then I guess I have to use gcrebuilder again *gasp*

2017-05-29 12:02:30	Testyo	Espyo, how do you download the source code of the stairs by using Kellam
2017-05-29 12:02:59	@Espyo	hi
2017-05-29 12:03:08	@Espyo	I'm... sorry?
2017-05-29 12:03:15	@Espyo	well, first, you find Kellam
2017-05-29 12:03:16	@Espyo	then you give up
2017-05-29 12:03:19	@Espyo	then eventually he finds you
2017-05-29 12:03:21	@Espyo	you get startled
2017-05-29 12:03:27	@Espyo	then you ask him if he has the blueprints to the stairs

2017-05-29 19:16:29	Marty2000	I got it free though...

2017-05-29 19:16:55	@Espyo	dunno
2017-05-29 19:19:32	Marty2000	Apparently, it was free when it got released
2017-05-29 19:19:39	@Espyo	ah
2017-05-29 19:22:32	Marty2000	I have 50 golden points that are about to expire and there's literally nothing I can spend them on. I already have the Pikmin 3 rewards, I already have the (complete) Zelda Guide, and the discounts do not interest me. :/

2017-05-29 19:23:36	Marty2000	I'm willing to give them to someone who could need them since they will expire and I have no use for them

2017-05-29 19:24:46	Marty2000	interested*
2017-05-29 19:25:30	Marty2000	Wait, will they be directly downloaded to your account or do you get a code that you can give to someone else?
2017-05-29 19:26:04	@Espyo	hm, good question
2017-05-29 19:26:09	@Espyo	but it might actually be the former
2017-05-29 19:26:17	@Espyo	I know I got this Xenoblade theme because a friend gifted me it
2017-05-29 19:26:27	@Espyo	but it wasn't from the My Nintendo program, I don't think
2017-05-29 19:26:35	Marty2000	Never mind, I got the answer
2017-05-29 19:26:35	Marty2000	*The reward is provided to you in the form of a download code. Redeem the code on Nintendo eShop to download the title.

2017-05-29 21:46:32	Yoshi2	tfw we could've had a C Kit for pikmin 2 if it had a proper linker map
2017-05-29 22:13:49	@Espyo	C Kit?

2017-05-29 22:17:21	Yoshi2	Espyo: there's a project for mario sunshine that allows code to be written in C and patched into the dol executable
2017-05-29 22:17:35	@Espyo	oh damn
2017-05-29 22:18:35	Yoshi2	because that game has a proper linker map in the files
2017-05-29 22:18:51	@Espyo	right
2017-05-29 22:18:56	Yoshi2	unlike pikmin 2 which has FUCKING RANDOMIZED GARBAGE for a .map file
2017-05-29 22:21:48	@Espyo	sounds like P2 all right
2017-05-29 22:21:49	@Espyo	ah well...
2017-05-29 22:22:04	Yoshi2	perfectly randomized
2017-05-29 22:22:17	Yoshi2	close to equal distribution of every value from 0 to 255

2017-06-06 23:14:23	Waterpikmin	Hey Espyo?
2017-06-06 23:14:37	@Espyo	hi
2017-06-06 23:14:59	Waterpikmin	I wanted to ask you a quick question on pikmin 2. 
2017-06-06 23:15:10	@Espyo	sure thing
2017-06-06 23:16:20	Waterpikmin	So I know Scruffy has been working on Pikmin 2 in First person and It's intrigued me very much, however, I can't figure out how to view and possibly edit textures, do you know any methods?
2017-06-06 23:17:43	@Espyo	sure
2017-06-06 23:17:54	@Espyo	Dolphin has a feature that allows you to dump all of the textures that are currently loaded in VRAM
2017-06-06 23:18:07	Waterpikmin	oh...
2017-06-06 23:18:08	@Espyo	let's see... I'll walk you through the options for Dolphin 5.0
2017-06-06 23:18:15	Waterpikmin	that's... amazing
2017-06-06 23:18:25	@Espyo	Options > Graphica settings > Advanced > Dump textures
2017-06-06 23:18:34	@Espyo	the second you check this, all textures that the game loads will be placed inside a folder
2017-06-06 23:18:40	@Espyo	which... is... SOMEWHERE
2017-06-06 23:18:42	Waterpikmin	i've literally been searching for so many programs and ive been lost on all of them
2017-06-06 23:18:46	@Espyo	Dolphin keeps changing where this folder is
2017-06-06 23:19:01	@Espyo	hehe, stuff like 3DRipperDX, I'm guessing?
2017-06-06 23:19:32	Waterpikmin	Nah, stuff like crystal tile, ive been trying to find it by searching how to open the file type
2017-06-06 23:19:44	Waterpikmin	which is BTI

2017-06-06 23:19:51	@Espyo	oh
2017-06-06 23:19:58	@Espyo	so you're trying to load the textures from the game's files?
2017-06-06 23:20:10	@Espyo	it's possible to convert .bti to good old .png
2017-06-06 23:20:33	@Espyo	http://pikmintkb.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Pikmin_2_instructions this page is barebones, but it's got a section on BTI files
2017-06-06 23:20:40	Waterpikmin	i tried that, and it was not working at all.
2017-06-06 23:20:53	@Espyo	it's finicky all right :/
2017-06-06 23:20:58	@Espyo	well, you still have the dump + edit method
2017-06-06 23:21:10	Waterpikmin	that works perfectly!
2017-06-06 23:21:11	@Espyo	when Dolphin dumps textures, it calls every file some weird name
2017-06-06 23:21:15	Waterpikmin	another thing though...
2017-06-06 23:21:19	@Espyo	but this file is what Dolphin uses to identify each texture
2017-06-06 23:21:32	@Espyo	so it can load back custom textures from a different folder, if they have the same name
2017-06-06 23:21:44	Waterpikmin	ahh ok
2017-06-06 23:21:53	Waterpikmin	so as long as i know the random name,
2017-06-06 23:22:01	Waterpikmin	it will load it as that?
2017-06-06 23:22:07	@Espyo	better than that, you can just copy the entire dump folder
2017-06-06 23:22:13	@Espyo	and paste the folder somewhere (I don't know exactly by heart)
2017-06-06 23:22:18	Waterpikmin	ahh ok
2017-06-06 23:22:19	@Espyo	and edit the files there, without renaming them
2017-06-06 23:22:22	@Espyo	everything should work straight away
2017-06-06 23:22:52	@Espyo	the option to load custom textures is in the same spot as the option to dump the game's textures, but it's called something like "Load custom textures"
2017-06-06 23:23:20	Waterpikmin	so that beam that shoots out of olimars helmet when he whistles, is that considered a texture or an animation?
2017-06-06 23:24:01	Waterpikmin	because it is very troubling to look at that in first person XD
2017-06-06 23:25:01	@Espyo	it's a texture
2017-06-06 23:25:14	@Espyo	but I think that it's the same texture responsible for the zaps on the electrical wire obstacles
2017-06-06 23:25:28	@Espyo	that's why the electricity in those wires wasn't visible on Scruffy's playthrough
2017-06-06 23:25:48	Waterpikmin	oooh
2017-06-06 23:25:52	Waterpikmin	that explains that
2017-06-06 23:26:07	Waterpikmin	i saw the whole thing so it now makes sense
2017-06-06 23:26:38	Waterpikmin	Thanks so much, you've saved me, and my father, so much trouble
2017-06-06 23:26:59	@Espyo	hehe, any time
2017-06-06 23:27:10	@Espyo	Scruffy's gonna release a tutorial any time soon
2017-06-06 23:27:16	@Espyo	but that IS pretty much what he did in a nutshell
2017-06-06 23:27:38	Waterpikmin	something that got me so excited was the fact that the game is so easy to edit.
2017-06-06 23:27:45	@Espyo	yep!
2017-06-06 23:27:48	Waterpikmin	imagine what we could change...
2017-06-06 23:27:52	@Espyo	a lot of stuff is just stored in text files
2017-06-06 23:28:02	@Espyo	we could change stuff like this ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeSb5-PMC3g
2017-06-06 23:28:34	Waterpikmin	That is so amazing...
2017-06-06 23:29:42	Waterpikmin	i would love to do a project on a hard mode of pikmin 2
2017-06-06 23:30:12	@Espyo	it'll take a bit of effort, but it's certainly very possible
2017-06-06 23:31:14	Waterpikmin	I think something like that could put a bit of spark in the community, as long as it's percieved as accessible
2017-06-06 23:31:26	@Espyo	yeah
2017-06-06 23:31:34	@Espyo	but there are other people doing mod work right now, I think
2017-06-06 23:31:38	@Espyo	so sparks aren't really necessary
2017-06-06 23:31:40	@Espyo	at least not for now
2017-06-06 23:33:11	Waterpikmin	This only gets me more excited for the community, anyways thanks so much for the help!
2017-06-06 23:33:35	@Espyo	you're welcome!
2017-06-06 23:33:51	@Espyo	are you on the Discord group?
2017-06-06 23:34:00	@Espyo	the hacking channel there is always around, willing to help
2017-06-06 23:34:03	@Espyo	and to show off the latest mods
2017-06-06 23:37:02	Waterpikmin	oh awesome!
2017-06-06 23:37:07	Waterpikmin	whats the link?
2017-06-06 23:38:08	@Espyo	https://discord.gg/pBzbnt7
2017-06-06 23:38:24	@Espyo	uh, let me know if it doesn't work — I've heard some users complain recently that it wasn't working, but I think it was just a fluke or something?
2017-06-06 23:39:54	Waterpikmin	im in! thanks so much! can't wait to participate!
2017-06-06 23:40:21	@Espyo	glad to have you!
2017-06-06 23:40:26	@Espyo	and nice, good to know it works
2017-06-06 23:40:57	Waterpikmin	anyways, gonna see if i can get those textures taken out, can't wait to play through that with my PSVR
2017-06-06 23:41:03	Waterpikmin	see you later!
2017-06-06 23:41:08	@Espyo	good luck
2017-06-06 23:41:17	@Espyo	I'll leave in a few minutes, but I can help out tomorrow, if something goes wrong
2017-06-06 23:41:27	Waterpikmin	sounds good! later!
2017-06-06 23:41:28	@Espyo	or you can just ask around on the Discord; somebody will likely know
2017-06-06 23:41:35	Waterpikmin	cool!
2017-06-06 23:41:36	@Espyo	it's easy, but stuff CAN go a bit weird and not work right
2017-06-06 23:41:39	@Espyo	but good luck anyway!
2017-06-06 23:42:01	Waterpikmin	I know how that is XD see you either here or on discord!
2017-06-06 23:42:12	@Espyo	see ya

2017-06-07 20:35:35	Yoshi2	Espyo: have I shown you what I brought home from a convention recently yet? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230572328344354816/320660750228258816/IMG_20170603_223038.jpg
2017-06-07 20:36:32	@Espyo	you haven't
2017-06-07 20:36:38	@Espyo	hey, not bad
2017-06-07 20:36:48	@Espyo	looks like it cost something like 25€
2017-06-07 20:36:49	Testyo	25 € = £ 17.665  / $ 27.18 
2017-06-07 20:37:46	Yoshi2	I got it for 35 but it's usual market price is 15€
2017-06-07 20:37:46	Testyo	15 € = £ 10.599  / $ 16.308 
2017-06-07 20:38:07	Yoshi2	capitalism ho
2017-06-07 20:40:58	Yoshi2	oh well, it looks cute enough so *shrug*
2017-06-07 20:41:12	@Espyo	yikes
2017-06-07 20:41:15	@Espyo	but yeah, agreed
2017-06-07 20:44:13	Yoshi2	my family will never know that the girl is from an ecchi manga https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291956181554167808/321189266719899661/Screenshot_20170605-093032_01.png
2017-06-07 20:45:10	@Espyo	of legal age I presume ._.
2017-06-07 20:45:28	Yoshi2	obviously
2017-06-07 20:45:34	@Espyo	good
2017-06-07 20:45:38	@Espyo	huh, that's a nice representation, actually
2017-06-07 20:45:45	@Espyo	looking at the manga and the figurine back to back
2017-06-07 20:47:03	Yoshi2	yup, suprisingly accurate
2017-06-07 20:50:45	Yoshi2	in the manga the girl is normally much bigger, but after a fight with an enemy she uses up so much energy that she becomes smaller and then she spends several chapters recovering
2017-06-07 20:53:11	@Espyo	Super Mario Bros, you say? 🤔
2017-06-07 20:53:37	UltraMario	ohey it's Yoshi2
2017-06-07 20:53:38	UltraMario	:wave:
2017-06-07 20:53:47	Yoshi2	hai UltraMario 
2017-06-07 20:56:02	@Espyo	meanwhile, at Manchester, I bought this adorable thing https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ecsn1gpMeVRXlobmhQOUk1TlE
2017-06-07 20:56:08	@Espyo	my mother and sister had the same reaction: loud squealing
2017-06-07 20:56:12	@Espyo	tbf, that was MY reaction too
2017-06-07 20:56:52	Yoshi2	awwww that's cute
2017-06-07 21:01:11	Yoshi2	my sister had the fun of unpacking my figurine
2017-06-07 21:02:06	@Espyo	pffthah
2017-06-07 21:02:10	@Espyo	and the fun of giving you THAT look
2017-06-07 21:02:21	Yoshi2	"you can see her underwear"
2017-06-07 21:02:36	Yoshi2	me: *poker face* "all figurines are like that"
2017-06-07 21:04:03	@Espyo	hehe
2017-06-07 21:04:07	@Espyo	well, you're not wrong
2017-06-07 21:05:10	Yoshi2	indeed
2017-06-07 21:05:44	Yoshi2	now it's standing on the shelf with a small paper flower in the hand made by my sister
2017-06-07 21:06:15	@Espyo	aww, well that's cute
2017-06-07 21:17:16	Yoshi2	huh this is neat, the game calculates the middle of the faces on loading
2017-06-07 21:21:01	@Espyo	oh
2017-06-07 21:21:07	@Espyo	yeah, I guess that makes a whole load of sense
2017-06-07 21:21:12	@Espyo	getting the middle point is pretty cheap
2017-06-07 21:33:24	Marty2000	I'm doing some science on Pikmin 2 regarding the fast pluck mechanic. You can "store" a fast pluck in the game memory (in limited ways, though)
2017-06-07 21:33:40	Marty2000	in the game's memory
2017-06-07 21:33:50	Marty2000	It's mostly useless
2017-06-07 21:33:51	Yoshi2	fast pluck
2017-06-07 21:34:00	Yoshi2	that sounds kinky
2017-06-07 21:34:03	Marty2000	.-.
2017-06-07 21:34:11	Yoshi2	how do you do it?
2017-06-07 21:34:40	Marty2000	Just press A twice in Pikmin and Pikmin 2 to fast pluck
2017-06-07 21:35:04	Yoshi2	how do you store it?
2017-06-07 21:36:17	Marty2000	In Pikmin 2, you need to be plucking Pikmin when a cutscene starts, then once the cutscene has ended, you've stored your next fast pluck in memory (you can move wherever you want, your next Pikmin will be plucked quicker)
2017-06-07 21:36:37	Marty2000	(or punch, fight, stuff like that)
2017-06-07 21:36:52	Yoshi2	ah
2017-06-07 21:36:54	Marty2000	I'm making a video on it anyway since there's quite a lot of stuff to try
2017-06-07 21:37:18	Marty2000	I'm using Cutscene Timer Storage to have cutscenes on my main file
2017-06-07 21:39:21	@Espyo	wow
2017-06-07 21:39:23	@Espyo	that's amazing
2017-06-07 21:43:17	Marty2000	It looks cool, but sadly the uses are rather limited (or so it seems)
2017-06-07 21:43:32	Marty2000	But it can still be useful
2017-06-07 21:44:25	@Espyo	if you can store it for a new save file, that'd be a tiny timesaver in new runs
2017-06-07 21:47:00	Marty2000	You probably can't since you can't save it for the next day or even when entering a cave...
2017-06-07 21:47:01	Marty2000	though
2017-06-07 21:47:03	Marty2000	it must just work
2017-06-07 21:47:10	Marty2000	I did not think of trying that
2017-06-07 21:47:13	Marty2000	worth a shot, I'd say
2017-06-07 21:48:10	Marty2000	might, not must*
2017-06-07 21:48:19	Marty2000	I'm going to try
2017-06-07 21:48:58	@Espyo	go for it
2017-06-07 21:51:31	Marty2000	Doesn't work

2017-06-08 22:14:32	Yoshi2	today's decompilation progress, everything in the red area isn't done yet https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291956181554167808/322483344124280833/image.png
2017-06-08 22:15:41	@Espyo	which isn't a lot
2017-06-08 22:15:43	@Espyo	looking good
2017-06-08 22:16:07	Yoshi2	resolving the branching is almost an art in itself
2017-06-08 22:17:39	Yoshi2	and you see that blue line going from the bottom to the top?
2017-06-08 22:17:53	@Espyo	I would, if facebook hadn't frozen my Firefox, AGAIN
2017-06-08 22:17:57	@Espyo	it's the second time today
2017-06-08 22:18:00	@Espyo	on two different machines
2017-06-08 22:18:03	@Espyo	get your act together, facebook
2017-06-08 22:18:20	Yoshi2	the blue line is a loop of sorts
2017-06-08 22:18:31	@Espyo	oh, I see
2017-06-08 22:18:38	@Espyo	isn't each one of these blocks a function call?
2017-06-08 22:19:19	Yoshi2	not function calls
2017-06-08 22:19:25	Yoshi2	the entire construct is one function
2017-06-08 22:19:37	Yoshi2	each block is just a block of code separated by branching
2017-06-08 22:20:07	@Espyo	ah
2017-06-08 22:20:10	@Espyo	why not indentation?
2017-06-08 22:20:32	Yoshi2	indentation?
2017-06-08 22:20:41	@Espyo	good old indentation
2017-06-08 22:20:56	@Espyo	something that belongs in an "if" starts a bit more in front
2017-06-08 22:21:01	@Espyo	instead of going every which direction
2017-06-08 22:21:18	@Espyo	though, I guess things get more complicated when it's raw assembly
2017-06-08 22:21:30	@Espyo	an "if" isn't just "do what's inside this block"
2017-06-08 22:21:42	@Espyo	in assembly, an "if" can go several ways with all of the gotos
2017-06-08 22:22:43	Yoshi2	considering it goes from top to down, I'm not sure how indentation would help
2017-06-08 22:36:34	Yoshi2	this is actually nicer because it's optimized to grow downwards, while identation would not guarantee such growth

2017-06-10 13:26:00	Marty2000	A few days ago, I uploaded this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRgdppyQ3qI and someone recently posted this comment: "You can pluck a pikmin then end the day﻿"
2017-06-10 13:26:11	Marty2000	In all honesty, I don't get what they're trying to say though :P
2017-06-10 13:26:45	@Espyo	oh, maybe they mean that if you're doing a fast pluck, and end the day, the very next pluck you do in the save file will also be quick?
2017-06-10 13:27:56	Marty2000	I think I put in the video that it does not work

2017-06-10 13:29:05	Marty2000	I did (3m43s)
2017-06-10 13:39:34	@Espyo	maybe if the day timer reaches 0? instead of using the pause menu
2017-06-10 13:40:11	Marty2000	Possible
2017-06-10 13:40:13	Marty2000	I'll have to try

2017-06-11 13:02:26	@Espyo	why is Python being dumb?

2017-06-11 13:03:05	@Espyo	this returns an empty list

2017-06-11 13:36:53	Yoshi2	Espyo: yeah you screwed up

2017-06-11 13:51:54	Yoshi2	espyo come baaack i want to know if that was the issue or not D:
2017-06-11 14:02:14	@Espyo	was lunching
2017-06-11 14:02:33	@Espyo	oh err
2017-06-11 14:02:36	@Espyo	I took that into account
2017-06-11 14:02:38	@Espyo	that ain't it
2017-06-11 14:02:43	@Espyo	I didn't explain right
2017-06-11 14:02:55	@Espyo	I had config['path'] as the full path except for the "images" part
2017-06-11 14:02:57	@Espyo	no goof here
2017-06-11 14:03:02	@Espyo	.......................I'm pretty sure
2017-06-11 14:04:00	@Espyo	nope, that's not the problem
2017-06-11 14:04:18	@Espyo	fyi, this is the script released by MediaWiki folk that allows you to save backups of wikis
2017-06-11 14:04:51	@Espyo	everything works fine, but if it was dumping images, got interrupted, and you try to resume it
2017-06-11 14:04:58	@Espyo	it reads the images folder to see which ones it already has and continues from there
2017-06-11 14:05:30	@Espyo	but for some reason, that listdir = ... instruction will just return an empty list if the string in the for is fed through os.path.abspath
2017-06-11 14:05:36	@Espyo	but will work fine if I feed it the full string manually
2017-06-11 14:07:56	@Espyo	I'm running a Python shell now, giving it similar commands, and everything's working properly
2017-06-11 14:13:20	@Espyo	!
2017-06-11 14:13:22	@Espyo	I found something
2017-06-11 14:13:26	@Espyo	if I feed it the string manually
2017-06-11 14:13:34	@Espyo	but I put a u before the string, so I guess that makes it a Unicode string
2017-06-11 14:13:38	@Espyo	it doesn't work any more
2017-06-11 14:13:46	@Espyo	maybe that's it; maybe config['path'] is a Unicode string
2017-06-11 14:16:41	@Espyo	yep, that was it all right
2017-06-11 14:16:49	@Espyo	doing a .encode('ascii') on it worked flawlessly
2017-06-11 14:17:00	@Espyo	...it's so weird though, this string is being used in other places as Unicode just fine

2017-06-12 19:20:58	Marty2000	Hi
2017-06-12 19:21:47	Yoshi2	hey marty
2017-06-12 19:29:35	Yoshi2	tales from reverse engineering: there are assembler instructions that do jack fucking shit
2017-06-12 19:29:46	Yoshi2	one example:
2017-06-12 19:29:54	Yoshi2	(as pseudo c code)
2017-06-12 19:30:00	Yoshi2	fp2 = fp24 * fp21
2017-06-12 19:30:06	Yoshi2	fp2 = fp2 + fp27
2017-06-12 19:30:22	Yoshi2	now, fp21 is a constant value as far as I can tell that is loaded from memory
2017-06-12 19:30:31	Yoshi2	and it is 0
2017-06-12 19:30:47	Yoshi2	so you get fp2 = 0 + fp27
2017-06-12 19:31:19	Yoshi2	i can nop the fp2 = fp24*fp21 instruction out and replace fp2 = fp2 + fp27 with a move register instruction (basically fp2 = fp27)
2017-06-12 19:31:26	Yoshi2	and everything still works
2017-06-12 19:34:33	@Espyo	brilliant
2017-06-12 19:34:44	@Espyo	I guess the compiler didn't clean that instruction out
2017-06-12 19:35:11	@Espyo	I think most C compilers do look at that, realize it's just a "constant times variable", and that the constant is 0, so they just remove that instruction
2017-06-12 20:31:33	Yoshi2	so the code takes a position x, y
2017-06-12 20:32:50	Yoshi2	or rather x, z because y is height on the gc
2017-06-12 20:33:30	Yoshi2	multiplies x by the x part of a triangle's normal, multiplies z by the z part triangle's normal
2017-06-12 20:33:34	Yoshi2	and adds them together
2017-06-12 20:33:46	Yoshi2	then it takes the unknown value
2017-06-12 20:34:54	Yoshi2	makes a new value that is that unknown value minus the added values from before
2017-06-12 20:34:58	Yoshi2	then
2017-06-12 20:35:10	Yoshi2	it divides the new value by the y part of the triangle's normal
2017-06-12 20:35:48	Yoshi2	multiplies that with a value that was calculated even earlier
2017-06-12 20:36:39	Yoshi2	then adds onto that x multiplied by the x part of the tangent of edge 1 of the triangle
2017-06-12 20:37:39	Yoshi2	adds onto that z multiplied by the z part of the tangent of edge 1 of the triangle
2017-06-12 20:38:32	Yoshi2	from that, subtracts a second unknown value
2017-06-12 20:38:42	Yoshi2	and then checks if THAT is smaller than or equal to 0
2017-06-12 20:39:07	Yoshi2	if you liked what I said so far you are in luck
2017-06-12 20:39:32	Yoshi2	if the condition is true, you get to do this two more times, probably once for each edge of the triangle
2017-06-12 22:10:40	@Espyo	phew, now I can read what you wrote
2017-06-12 22:10:50	@Espyo	I was tampering with the engine's shadows
2017-06-12 22:10:54	@Espyo	had to think about coordinates real hard
2017-06-12 22:11:01	@Espyo	then I glanced at what you wrote, and your coordinates
2017-06-12 22:11:03	@Espyo	and just noped right out of there
2017-06-12 22:11:49	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-06-12 22:11:57	@Espyo	I'm sure it makes sense once we actually understand what it's doing

2017-06-13 22:07:13	Yoshi2	thus have an y component of zero
2017-06-13 22:07:25	Yoshi2	there is division going on using the y component of the normal
2017-06-13 22:12:00	Yoshi2	maybe I could carry on as if
2017-06-13 22:12:10	Yoshi2	the y component (the height component)

2017-06-15 12:54:00	Testyo	nah, it has a viration feature that massages my arse

2017-06-15 12:54:51	@Espyo	...what, Testyo
2017-06-15 12:54:52	Testyo	some sort of dark red color, to counter the real world, even if it's just for existing
2017-06-15 12:55:09	Yoshi2	ok so it took a lot of sweat and tears and sanity but I think I got the collision format down
2017-06-15 13:00:17	Yoshi2	i posted it on the discord in the hacking channel
2017-06-15 13:26:14	@Espyo	nice

2017-06-15 15:17:06	Testyo	hehe actual suicide, so nope
2017-06-15 15:40:37	Yoshi2	still finishing things up?
2017-06-15 15:51:50	@Espyo	read
2017-06-15 19:24:31	Yoshi2	a person I know is working on a somewhat minimalistic language for specifying the format of binary data
2017-06-15 19:24:31	Yoshi2	and he claims you can just take the code written in this language, run it through the interpreter and it will parse the binary data of a file you want into the correct format for use in an actual programming language
2017-06-15 19:24:31	Yoshi2	and in a similar way use this code to write the binary data again
2017-06-15 19:24:31	Yoshi2	but he does not yet have an interpreter ready for it and he thinks it's so revolutionary that he does not want to release the specification of the language because somebody might steal the idea
2017-06-15 19:25:07	Yoshi2	is that really anything special? I see several problems with it :L

2017-06-16 21:38:45	Yoshi2	superbmd will be the next project by the developer of bmdcubed

2017-06-16 22:14:42	Testyo	COCK? AH
2017-06-16 22:26:19	@Espyo	Yoshi2: I can't remember: did you make a moon jump for US Pikmin 2?
2017-06-16 23:10:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: US pikmin 2 already had a moonjump code iirc
2017-06-16 23:10:17	Yoshi2	I only ported it to PAL
2017-06-16 23:11:50	@Espyo	couldn't find it on geckocodes.org
2017-06-16 23:12:01	@Espyo	oh, it comes with Dolphin or something, doesn't it?
2017-06-16 23:12:01	@Espyo	one sec
2017-06-16 23:12:14	@Espyo	yep, I think that's it
2017-06-16 23:12:29	@Espyo	I can't remember: was that code functional?
2017-06-16 23:12:50	@Espyo	we've talked about moon jumps and coordinates so much, in both P1 and P2, that I'm getting all of my memories mixed up
2017-06-16 23:13:55	Yoshi2	pretty sure it worked
2017-06-16 23:14:11	Yoshi2	the AR cheat by ralph for pikmin 1 didn't work and I had to fix it up
2017-06-16 23:14:27	@Espyo	right, that was it, wasn't it?
2017-06-16 23:14:27	@Espyo	thanks
2017-06-16 23:14:42	@Espyo	T-Rex-Quisite, an old Pikmin runner, wants to tamper around, but he doesn't have Dolphin
2017-06-16 23:14:46	@Espyo	he has to rely on Action Replay
2017-06-16 23:14:46	@Espyo	RIP
2017-06-16 23:16:35	Yoshi2	ripperino
2017-06-16 23:26:43	Yoshi2	if he has a wii with homebrew theoretically he might be able to use the gecko cheats in gc games
2017-06-16 23:30:01	@Espyo	but that requires doing some real nasty stuff with the NAND and all of that
2017-06-16 23:30:11	@Espyo	I think he'd have an easier time just getting an emulator and an IsO
2017-06-16 23:30:16	@Espyo	but yeah, I think you're right
2017-06-16 23:43:20	Yoshi2	getting the emulator would be the hassle-free option, yup
2017-06-16 23:46:15	Yoshi2	mmmm my battalion wars discord now has the admin and one of the mods from the advance wars discord

2017-06-17 23:15:59	Yoshi2	i almost got custom collision working
2017-06-17 23:16:08	Yoshi2	but it doesn't line up with the model I made for some reason
2017-06-17 23:16:50	Yoshi2	collision is facing a different direction compared to the model
2017-06-17 23:18:11	Yoshi2	it's mirrored along the axis and strangely shifted
2017-06-17 23:23:27	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-06-17 23:23:40	@Espyo	well, I guess that means you got your positives and negatives mixed up in one of the angles
2017-06-17 23:23:44	@Espyo	that should fix both things
2017-06-17 23:23:50	@Espyo	but that's too simple; you probably thought of that already

2017-06-18 19:49:26	Yoshi2	zero progress was made on collision today
2017-06-18 19:49:35	Yoshi2	instead i looked at real tanks
2017-06-18 19:52:00	Yoshi2	also orientations in 3d models is a pain
2017-06-18 19:52:12	Yoshi2	blender has export and import options for orienting the model
2017-06-18 20:27:16	@Espyo	hah
2017-06-18 20:27:18	@Espyo	yeah...
2017-06-18 21:04:30	Yoshi2	i am not sure where the fault lies
2017-06-18 21:04:46	Yoshi2	in my converter? Or are my custom models faulty?
2017-06-18 21:16:06	@Espyo	*shrug* doesn't really matter
2017-06-18 21:16:18	@Espyo	as long as the final thing has the axes facing the right way...
2017-06-18 21:16:24	@Espyo	it doesn't matter where you fix them
2017-06-18 21:16:32	@Espyo	there's no right way
2017-06-18 21:16:37	Yoshi2	I once got the axes right
2017-06-18 21:16:49	Yoshi2	but the model was shifted compared to the collision for some reason
2017-06-18 21:22:21	@Espyo	like skewered?
2017-06-18 21:23:18	Yoshi2	not sure if the position is different or the scaling
2017-06-18 21:23:41	Yoshi2	THERE IS THIS FUCKING ENEMY THAT HAS A MILLION HP AND IS IN THE WAY ALL THE TIME UGH

2017-06-19 22:28:38	@Espyo	after all, between scourging the depths of youtube for interesting SMS tidbits, with titles such as "lol sms xddd" or other cryptic stuff some uploaders put, only to find videos shot at 48p with no audio and no explanation of what's going on

2017-06-19 22:29:11	@Espyo	but I REALLY hate when people go uncredited
2017-06-19 22:29:23	@Espyo	that irks me more than the fact that most of these "secrets" have already been found out
2017-06-19 22:29:31	@Espyo	he DOES credit people sometimes...
2017-06-19 22:34:10	Yoshi2	in the case of luigi he kinda did the credit in a weird way, tring to pass off as if he also did a luigi mod for which he rigged the model
2017-06-19 22:34:46	Yoshi2	... except the linked file is identical to what the original author created
2017-06-19 22:35:45	Yoshi2	the chances of two people independently making a custom model and rigging it so that the same binary file comes out is very close to zero
2017-06-19 22:44:06	@Espyo	heh!
2017-06-19 22:49:11	Yoshi2	somebody said that rfd wants to be known as the pannenkoek of SMS so maybe that's why he is trying to appear as a better modder than he actually is
2017-06-19 23:54:52	@Espyo	yeah
2017-06-19 23:54:56	@Espyo	certainly sounds like it

2017-06-24 19:33:59	Prezintenden	hey you guys actually here or have your names just burned themselves into the idler column
2017-06-24 19:46:42	Marty2000	Prezintenden: hi
2017-06-24 19:48:02	Prezintenden	oh cool, hey
2017-06-24 19:48:32	Prezintenden	I was going to ask something but I read up on it a bit and apparently it's not as much of an issue as I thought
2017-06-24 19:49:26	Marty2000	Alright. Don't hesitate to ask anything, anyway ;)
2017-06-24 19:50:15	Prezintenden	I want to translate all the names of the enemies and whatnot but German constantly uses compounds that make it a bit iffy to get an exact translation into english. I noticed with Spanish and French that they also have compounds often but from what I gather the nuances are a bit different there
2017-06-24 19:51:03	Marty2000	Yeah
2017-06-24 19:51:28	Marty2000	not to mention that depending on the region of the game, the same language can use title case or not and whatnot
2017-06-24 19:51:38	Marty2000	Yoshi2 once helped us with the German translations
2017-06-24 19:52:07	Yoshi2	hey o/
2017-06-24 19:52:19	Prezintenden	you speak german?
2017-06-24 19:52:32	Marty2000	By the way, when I added the German names, I ran into problems with hyphens mostly
2017-06-24 19:52:55	Marty2000	since sometimes I did not know whether the hyphen was for the same word or for two different words
2017-06-24 19:53:03	Prezintenden	yeah that's what i was about to get into but I'm kinda not sure how to put it into words...
2017-06-24 19:53:20	Marty2000	Yoshi2 is German ;)
2017-06-24 19:53:55	Yoshi2	I do speak German
2017-06-24 19:55:05	Prezintenden	okay long story short, what's your opinion:  Schlammstampfer -> Mud Stomper / Mud-Stomper
2017-06-24 19:57:38	Marty2000	Here: https://www.pikminwiki.com/Network_Mainbrain#Names_in_other_languages In game, the player sees "Netzwerk-zentrale", but I added "Netzwerkzentrale"
2017-06-24 19:57:48	Marty2000	As for the translations, if you think there are several possibilities
2017-06-24 19:58:01	Marty2000	just add what you think fits best, in my opinion
2017-06-24 19:58:34	Yoshi2	i would translate schlammstampfer as mud stomper
2017-06-24 19:59:39	Yoshi2	when adding a dash in the translation, pay attention to whether that makes sense from the prespective of the english language
2017-06-24 20:00:31	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Object.E2.80.93verbal_noun_compounds
2017-06-24 20:01:49	Marty2000	Yep
2017-06-24 20:02:41	Prezintenden	I mean that section to me says "If you wish to be very accurate (which we want to be here, as we are translating a fictional name, where the reader has basically no context whatsever), you use a hyphen"
2017-06-24 20:03:33	Prezintenden	It's nitpicking of course. So I'll just continue using hyphens as little as possible
2017-06-24 20:05:42	Prezintenden	also "Netzwerk-zentrale" is wrong, they would have had to capitalise the Z in that case. But I think Netzwerkzentrale 
2017-06-24 20:06:01	Prezintenden	well maybe it is a bit long for chlidren. but it's readable
2017-06-24 20:08:10	@Espyo	heya Prez
2017-06-24 20:08:19	@Espyo	uh, I don't think there's any standard for what to do with compounds
2017-06-24 20:08:24	@Espyo	so... just do whatever seems best
2017-06-24 20:08:32	@Espyo	remember that the wiki is for the readers
2017-06-24 20:08:36	@Espyo	if the readers get confused, it's pretty pointless
2017-06-24 20:08:51	@Espyo	or rather, it's for the readers's understanding
2017-06-24 20:13:21	Prezintenden	yeah it seems the rules are actually very loose in English
2017-06-24 20:14:13	Prezintenden	Man this OddFan guy. Just came in one day and added really weird translations, then left
2017-06-24 20:18:37	@Espyo	yeah, I don't even know what to think about those kind of users any more
2017-06-24 20:20:52	Yoshi2	there was one guy on TCRF whose only edit was changing "Panther" to "Panzer"
2017-06-24 20:25:21	@Espyo	ah yes, I remember that episode

2017-06-27 21:12:10	Testyo	Gavin is anyways
2017-06-27 21:16:16	@Espyo	hi
2017-06-27 22:08:11	Yoshi2	bloody hell, I was helping out another person with his custom mario model and when I tested his model it worked on my first try
2017-06-27 22:08:34	@Espyo	wizardry
2017-06-27 22:08:40	@Espyo	that can't just HAPPEN
2017-06-27 22:09:30	Yoshi2	either I became good or in my first tries I did something wrong that I'm doing right now
2017-06-27 22:29:54	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf3E-Zy2PyA amazing, turbonoozle storage in sunshine
2017-06-27 22:39:03	@Espyo	oh, Turbonozzle is the horizontal one, right?
2017-06-27 22:39:18	Yoshi2	yes
2017-06-27 22:39:34	@Espyo	wow, that's so simple, heh
2017-06-27 22:39:35	@Espyo	love it
2017-06-27 22:39:45	Yoshi2	and it does a whole lot of nothing
2017-06-27 22:39:58	Yoshi2	because it is only possible in this specific spot and only gets you 2 feet far
2017-06-27 22:39:58	Testyo	2 feet = 60.96 cm

2017-06-28 21:59:35	Testyo	HELLO EVERYONE!
2017-06-28 22:04:55	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-06-28 22:04:55	Testyo	YEAH YOU SOUNDED LIKE YOU CREATE A NEW HOUSE NEXT TO YOURS WITH A MASSIVE SIGN SAYING "IT'S AT 18:00"
2017-06-28 22:05:37	@Espyo	hi
2017-06-28 22:35:04	Yoshi2	Espyo: the turbo nozzle storage from yesterday doesn't just need a chain fence, it needs one that touches the ground
2017-06-28 22:35:57	@Espyo	ah
2017-06-28 22:44:20	Yoshi2	I found out from people at the sunshine modding server how to modify the banner https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/280334807756570625/329695433679044608/image.png
2017-06-28 22:56:57	@Espyo	hah
2017-06-28 22:57:00	@Espyo	that actually works?
2017-06-28 22:58:26	Yoshi2	yes, but not through gcrebuilder
2017-06-28 22:59:11	Yoshi2	needs a tool called gcbanner.exe
2017-06-28 22:59:35	Yoshi2	and then you directly replace the .bnr file used by the game
2017-06-28 23:00:18	@Espyo	ah, figured it wouldn't be through gcrebuilder
2017-06-28 23:01:45	Yoshi2	also have you ever wondered why it is so easy to clip into this building in mario sunshine? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/280331284062928896/328821569633910795/image.png
2017-06-28 23:03:20	Yoshi2	that's because the side of the building in the collision is actually facing downwards, resulting in an extreme angle through which mario can slip: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/280331284062928896/328822985215442957/image.png

2017-06-30 21:52:13	@Espyo	I moved house recently, and these past few days, I had to keep staying at the old house to help repaint it
2017-06-30 21:52:22	@Espyo	should be over now, though

2017-07-01 12:50:59	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2017-07-01 12:50:59	Testyo	anyway, game's fucking up your hostname...
2017-07-01 12:52:17	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-01 13:07:21	Yoshi2	does this look good: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/188322587116306433/330673131557617684/image.png it's for a program that moves units and objects from levels that have them into levels that don't have them
2017-07-01 13:17:12	@Espyo	looks great
2017-07-01 13:17:27	@Espyo	though please tell me it's possible to multi-select
2017-07-01 13:23:19	Yoshi2	maaaaybe

2017-07-01 13:50:27	@Espyo	ye
2017-07-01 13:50:48	@Espyo	hm, though actually, maybe the deletion button shouldn't be in the middle
2017-07-01 13:50:58	@Espyo	if you already establish that the middle buttons are stuff that involves some sort of transition
2017-07-01 13:51:03	@Espyo	and then have the delete button not be like that
2017-07-01 13:51:05	@Espyo	it's awkward
2017-07-01 13:51:10	@Espyo	put it below the list?
2017-07-01 13:55:05	Yoshi2	but then it's not symetrical :L
2017-07-01 13:55:51	Yoshi2	and there's already an arrow pointing only at the right list

2017-07-03 20:37:57	@Espyo	what's your end-goal with this?
2017-07-03 20:47:14	Yoshi2	more specific parsing code for specific files
2017-07-03 20:47:30	Yoshi2	maybe even using it for a gui editor when that ever happens

2017-07-04 20:39:35	Yoshi2	I wrote something to parse/write waterbox files as an example of how the parser/writer could work
2017-07-04 20:42:30	@Espyo	oh, right
2017-07-04 20:42:42	@Espyo	err, probably want to put it in another file |:
2017-07-04 20:42:46	@Espyo	even it IS an example...
2017-07-04 20:43:51	Yoshi2	I don't want to have one file per parser though
2017-07-04 20:44:04	Yoshi2	that's something only java devs do and i'm no java dev
2017-07-04 20:44:13	Yoshi2	well, at most I might 
2017-07-04 20:44:27	Yoshi2	put the other parsers in their own file but *shrug*
2017-07-04 20:46:05	@Espyo	yeah, at least that
2017-07-04 20:46:17	@Espyo	but yeah, don't go around creating singleton parser factory instances >_>
2017-07-04 20:48:46	Yoshi2	I'm not sure why I should put the parsers in their own file tho
2017-07-04 20:55:27	Yoshi2	at the moment, I want to avoid doing something like
2017-07-04 20:55:33	Yoshi2	from file1 import parser1
2017-07-04 20:55:38	Yoshi2	from file2 import parser2
2017-07-04 20:55:45	Yoshi2	let's have everything in one
2017-07-04 20:55:54	Yoshi2	from file import parser1, parser2, parser3
2017-07-04 20:56:13	Yoshi2	keeping the base parser all alone in its own place seems silly too, it's not that much code
2017-07-04 20:56:21	Yoshi2	so might as well throw that in too
2017-07-04 20:57:03	Yoshi2	when the parsers get more complicated maybe I'll branch out into different files and do some __init__.py magic so that the situation above can be avoided

2017-07-05 19:32:19	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2017-07-05 19:35:35	@J	Yoshi2: I actually was at one point planning to do it the other way round, have the GCEdit GUI able to edit files in-place by calling out to plugins that implement the editing part
2017-07-05 19:55:23	Yoshi2	J: seems like a neat idea but searching around in the game's files doesn't seem very fun
2017-07-05 19:55:51	Yoshi2	or convenient
2017-07-05 19:56:37	Yoshi2	e.g. pikmin 2 has one very messy structure so it would be better if the program listed e.g. all levels from which you can pick what to edit
2017-07-05 19:57:53	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-07-05 19:57:53	Testyo	They do develop the characters a lot during that time AGAIN
2017-07-05 19:58:11	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-05 20:10:46	@J	yeah, I get it
2017-07-05 20:12:59	@J	it would definitely be useful to just have a text editor in there, but a more specialised tool seems useful too

2017-07-08 12:51:17	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2017-07-08 13:16:12	@J	a
2017-07-08 13:16:16	@J	oops
2017-07-08 13:29:29	@Espyo	happened again, did it
2017-07-08 13:29:49	@Espyo	dunno if I told you, but it happened to me too some 6 months ago
2017-07-08 13:29:55	@J	that's not my password
2017-07-08 13:29:56	@Espyo	and I added an autoreplace for that too
2017-07-08 13:30:00	@J	I type '/a' to become not away
2017-07-08 13:30:05	@Espyo	ah, all right
2017-07-08 13:30:22	@J	anyway, been a while, how's it going?
2017-07-08 13:30:26	@J	any news I should know?
2017-07-08 13:32:06	@Espyo	yeah, it's been a bit
2017-07-08 13:32:26	@Espyo	hmm, besides me going out to meet friends in Manchester in early June, nothing much, really
2017-07-08 13:33:53	@J	I'm currently writing some horrible hacks so I can make a sensible Arch Linux package for Dustmod (a Dustforce mod)
2017-07-08 13:34:25	@J	it has an auto-updater that works using patches, so I worked out how it does that and implemented it in the package build process
2017-07-08 13:35:36	@Espyo	oh nice
2017-07-08 13:35:46	@Espyo	hmm, for the Ubuntu family, there are packages of everything and anything
2017-07-08 13:35:51	@Espyo	so what, is it much harder to make one for Arch?
2017-07-08 13:36:45	@J	actually I find Arch's packaging system easier to work with
2017-07-08 13:36:51	@J	easier to make packages, for me
2017-07-08 13:37:07	@J	but making packages in general is tricky for auto-updating applications
2017-07-08 13:37:33	@J	because you just want to work around the auto-updater, eg. in this case it segfaults if it can't write to its install directory
2017-07-08 13:38:35	@Espyo	oh, right
2017-07-08 13:43:49	@J	the patch seems to be some custom archive format, so I wrote a shell implementation and somehow it's only 11 lines
2017-07-08 14:15:17	@Espyo	...wow
2017-07-08 15:21:17	@J	okay, all done, and I used https://www.changedetection.com/ with the auto-updater URL to email me when it updates
2017-07-08 15:24:30	@Espyo	huh, didn't know about that site
2017-07-08 15:26:28	@J	it can be pretty useful
2017-07-08 15:26:37	@Espyo	how quick is it to update?
2017-07-08 15:26:57	@J	when you set one up you can choose how often it checks
2017-07-08 15:27:02	@J	the most frequent option is daily
2017-07-08 15:27:12	@Espyo	oh, I see
2017-07-08 15:27:15	@Espyo	I thought it indexed everything
2017-07-08 15:27:18	@Espyo	like the wayback machine
2017-07-08 15:27:36	@J	no, no, you add a particular page to it
2017-07-08 15:27:43	@Espyo	that sounds pretty good then
2017-07-08 15:28:31	@J	in my 'future personal projects' list is a version of this which you can host yourself, with RSS feed output, and I'd like to be able to do things like filter to a particular CSS selector or regular expression
2017-07-08 15:28:44	@J	obviously not happening any time soon
2017-07-08 15:28:49	@Espyo	nice
2017-07-08 15:28:55	@Espyo	yeah, that doesn't sound like something you'd do overnight
2017-07-08 15:28:56	@Espyo	but
2017-07-08 15:28:59	@Espyo	it doesn't sound that hard either
2017-07-08 15:29:09	@Espyo	sounds fun tbh
2017-07-08 15:29:40	@Espyo	eh, you can probably hack something up with sed, cron, and wget though *shrug*
2017-07-08 16:40:50	Testyo	I'M ONLY FAR?
2017-07-08 16:43:29	Yoshi2	progress on pikmin 2 hacking is being made slowly
2017-07-08 20:01:15	Testyo	bull kept freezing..

2017-07-08 21:46:43	Yoshi2	well, "lego", this set is by cobi

2017-07-11 18:45:07	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2017-07-11 18:49:35	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-07-11 18:49:36	Testyo	so you know how good it feels to be working on THAT it runs under windows xp, I need to add some specific settings
2017-07-11 19:01:04	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-11 19:13:35	Yoshi2	how do I implement a good zoom in feature? <_>
2017-07-11 19:16:00	Yoshi2	I have something that divides all sizes and coordinates by a zoom factor but that is skewed towards the middle
2017-07-11 19:16:12	Yoshi2	the origin, to be more specific
2017-07-11 19:20:41	@Espyo	one mo
2017-07-11 19:21:58	@Espyo	https://github.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine/blob/master/Source/source/editors/area_editor.cpp#L2858
2017-07-11 19:42:07	Yoshi2	that's not quite as helpful as it should be 
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	:|
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	you feed that function the zoom factor
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	it saves the current mouse coordinates
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	uh
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	and then it does stuff
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	ok, I guess this made sense to past me
2017-07-11 19:46:22	@Espyo	but basically you do whatever, and then pan the camera based on the mouse's position compared to wherever the zoom pivot is
2017-07-11 19:46:22	-->	Yoshi3 (Yoshi2@2210-6ux2-a110-4-1938-0f1r-v156-zf71.ipv1dyn.netcologne.de) has joined #pikipedia
2017-07-11 19:46:42	Yoshi3	it's basically do_zoom() where do_zoom() is a compiled function implemented by the graphics library
2017-07-11 19:56:35	@Espyo	what, yours?
2017-07-11 20:11:04	Yoshi2	yours
2017-07-11 20:17:30	@Espyo	eh, not really
2017-07-11 20:17:34	@Espyo	everything I'm doing is raw
2017-07-11 20:17:40	@Espyo	tampering with the coordinates, doing transformations
2017-07-11 20:17:42	@Espyo	it's all on my end
2017-07-11 20:17:51	@Espyo	and my do_zoom is written by me, not a library function
2017-07-11 20:42:11	@Espyo	J: did you use this technique? https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/6mhnw4/after_years_of_trying_to_learn_to_juggle_and
2017-07-11 21:00:10	Yoshi2	what I need is a reliable way to keep the center in the center when zooming out
2017-07-11 21:01:52	@Espyo	oh, instead of the top left?
2017-07-11 21:41:08	Yoshi2	I mean the center of the viewport should be centered on the objects you are looking at
2017-07-11 21:41:54	Yoshi2	at the moment if you are far away from the origin of the level and zoom in or out you lose the stuff you are looking at
2017-07-11 21:42:06	Yoshi2	here's a video of the editor in the current state https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9jO3zErAdI
2017-07-11 21:44:53	Yoshi2	if you got any ideas on how to fix that, I'm all ears

2017-07-11 21:56:01	@Espyo	right
2017-07-11 21:56:33	@Espyo	ok, so, do you have a way of knowing what coordinates you're looking at?
2017-07-11 21:56:48	@Espyo	I mean, you SHOULD, otherwise you're using quantum magic
2017-07-11 21:57:00	@Espyo	but I mean: do you have the coordinates at the center of the screen saved in some variable?
2017-07-11 22:02:08	@J	Espyo: never done that, no
2017-07-11 22:11:21	@Espyo	how good are you at it now?
2017-07-11 22:14:34	@J	kind of hit a wall beyond a load of 3-ball/club patterns
2017-07-11 22:14:47	@J	I can do 5 balls and slowly getting there with 5 clubs
2017-07-11 22:17:28	@Espyo	oh yeah, I guess the clubs add another variable, huh
2017-07-11 22:17:33	@Espyo	yikes
2017-07-11 22:18:01	@Espyo	do they just naturally orient themselves to be grabbed right with minimal effort, or do you actually have to throw them perfectly so they don't land on the big side?
2017-07-11 22:18:19	@Espyo	like, you know objects with weird shapes point a specific part down when falling?
2017-07-11 22:18:28	@Espyo	I'm asking if it's more or less the same with the clubs, or if it's all about the wrist
2017-07-11 22:32:49	@J	you can reasonably catch them on the big side
2017-07-11 22:32:58	@J	but you do have to specifically spin them the right amount
2017-07-11 22:33:10	@J	and with 5 clubs, you do 2 spins
2017-07-11 22:35:58	@J	oh, I was distracted so I guess I didn't answer great
2017-07-11 22:36:09	@J	but they do keep spinning, they don't stop with a specific orientation

2017-07-16 17:09:13	Yoshi2	have you seen double precision floats be used as 52 bit integers?
2017-07-16 17:14:53	@Espyo	I hope I never have to hear that sentence in my life again
2017-07-16 17:14:55	@Espyo	no, I haven't
2017-07-16 17:42:45	Yoshi2	currently helping a guy with some MKDD reverse engineering and some of what I've seen looks like doubles are used as integers
2017-07-16 17:43:29	Yoshi2	with the exponent being set so that it equals to 52, which is exactly the amount of bits used for the fraction
2017-07-16 17:44:04	@Espyo	hmm
2017-07-16 17:44:22	@Espyo	I've heard of fixed point numbers
2017-07-16 17:44:28	@Espyo	but I don't think those are that
2017-07-16 17:44:42	Yoshi2	this is literally a double 
2017-07-16 17:44:50	Yoshi2	it's loaded into the float registers of the gamecube
2017-07-16 17:44:53	@Espyo	right
2017-07-16 17:45:00	@Espyo	might be some obscure optimization
2017-07-16 17:45:50	@Espyo	>All 3D graphics engines on Sony's original PlayStation, Sega's Saturn, Nintendo's Game Boy Advance (only 2D), Nintendo DS (2D and 3D), Nintendo Gamecube[12] and GP2X Wiz video game systems use fixed-point arithmetic for the same reason as Tremor and Toast: to gain throughput on an architecture without an FPU (e.g. the PlayStation included hardware support for 4.12bit values in its transformation coprocessor).
2017-07-16 19:30:18	Testyo	(except 1% of users care
2017-07-16 19:37:27	Yoshi2	testyo

2017-07-16 19:37:37	Yoshi2	why are you dropping those truth bombs
2017-07-16 19:39:44	@Espyo	he does that sometimes
2017-07-16 20:37:36	Yoshi2	reverse engineering is at least twice as fun when doing it together with another person
2017-07-16 20:48:23	@Espyo	twice as efficient?
2017-07-16 20:51:13	Yoshi2	twice as fun
2017-07-16 20:51:18	Yoshi2	which can translate into efficiency

2017-07-17 19:37:27	Yoshi2	let me show you in a bit why it's a door stopper

2017-07-17 19:38:25	@Espyo	hot damn
2017-07-17 19:38:32	@Espyo	that counts as a weapon in some countries
2017-07-17 19:38:43	Yoshi2	it's suprisingly light actually
2017-07-17 19:39:12	@Espyo	hm, weird
2017-07-17 19:39:12	Yoshi2	there were some thicker magazines at the japanese book store
2017-07-17 19:40:03	Yoshi2	this magazine contains one chapter of many manga series
2017-07-17 19:40:35	Yoshi2	apparently this is how the series start out
2017-07-17 19:40:48	Yoshi2	they are assembled into a single manga only later
2017-07-17 19:42:09	@Espyo	that's such a weird approach
2017-07-17 19:42:13	@Espyo	oh, but I guess it makes sense
2017-07-17 19:42:16	@Espyo	you get the same bang for your buck
2017-07-17 19:42:21	@Espyo	except the customer also gets exposed to a LOT more
2017-07-17 19:42:27	@Espyo	meaning they can become fans of a lot more
2017-07-17 19:42:39	@Espyo	meaning more stuff the fan will buy later on
2017-07-17 19:42:42	@Espyo	...genius
2017-07-17 19:45:35	Yoshi2	the author can publish chapters as they are finished, it's cheaper because of economy of scale, the publishers can add more risky series
2017-07-17 19:45:50	Yoshi2	and the exposure to more people, yup
2017-07-17 20:30:12	@Espyo	right
2017-07-17 20:32:55	Yoshi2	on the other hand though
2017-07-17 20:33:09	Yoshi2	if you only care about one series, this is 15 bucks for one whole chapter
2017-07-17 20:33:31	Yoshi2	or 700 yen, the original price
2017-07-17 20:33:32	Testyo	700 Yen = 5.6 € / £ 4.2  / $ 7.7 
2017-07-17 20:33:47	Yoshi2	what a ripoff
2017-07-17 20:33:51	Yoshi2	i want my 10€ back
2017-07-17 20:33:52	Testyo	10 € = £ 7.066  / $ 10.872 
2017-07-17 20:35:15	@Espyo	yeah...
2017-07-17 20:35:28	@Espyo	but
2017-07-17 20:35:36	@Espyo	it's a rip-off with free other series
2017-07-17 20:44:37	Yoshi2	none of which I can read due to lack of japanese language skills
2017-07-17 20:45:12	Yoshi2	the cover is from a series I recognize though. That's worth a thousand euros

2017-07-17 21:33:58	@Espyo	similar to Alph and Brittany
2017-07-17 21:34:10	@Espyo	well, if it's always flying, it's not a threat, since it can't squash .-.

2017-07-19 19:29:13	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-19 19:32:29	Yoshi2	everything points towards a kind of hacky integer->float conversion
2017-07-19 20:11:35	@Espyo	that sounds about right...
2017-07-19 20:11:37	@Espyo	eep
2017-07-19 20:11:42	@Espyo	probably done for performance

2017-07-19 20:54:22	Yoshi2	fun stuff happening at aroun line 22
2017-07-19 20:54:25	Yoshi2	*around
2017-07-19 21:01:46	@Espyo	wow man
2017-07-19 21:15:25	Yoshi2	this is not even my final form
2017-07-19 21:15:32	Yoshi2	or the code's final form
2017-07-19 21:16:58	Yoshi2	I'm at three files for RE'ing three different functions https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/308712245854994463/337282784051593216/unknown.png
2017-07-19 21:17:52	Yoshi2	well, one calls the other that the other
2017-07-19 21:17:59	Yoshi2	*that calls the other
2017-07-19 21:18:33	@Espyo	hey, only 3-deep so far
2017-07-19 21:43:29	Yoshi2	but pretty wide
2017-07-19 21:43:42	Yoshi2	there is one other function from the first file that I didn't go into yet
2017-07-19 21:53:21	@Espyo	fun
2017-07-19 21:54:33	Yoshi2	ironically, battalion wars uses XML files that make modding it easier
2017-07-19 21:54:43	Yoshi2	but modifying the assembler code is probably less easy
2017-07-19 21:55:48	Yoshi2	because you have the xml parser as an additional layer between you and the raw data

2017-07-20 19:26:18	Testyo	I said SOUNDS LIKE AN AWAKENING CONFESSION BACKDROP because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages IT'S LIKE AN AWAKENING CONFESSION BACKDROP and sounds like a plan. They were joined by the common word LIKE.

2017-07-20 20:02:45	Yoshi2	https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/243513506358362112.png
2017-07-20 20:03:55	Yoshi2	so there really is a new orange pikmin type?
2017-07-20 20:05:29	@Espyo	nope
2017-07-20 20:05:30	@Espyo	that's the joke

2017-07-20 20:07:41	Yoshi2	>-< the orange color is prettier than the rest
2017-07-20 20:11:51	@Espyo	yeah
2017-07-20 20:11:55	@Espyo	it suited you
2017-07-20 20:30:09	Yoshi2	there better be some sort of replacement because i won't stand for this D:<
2017-07-20 20:30:16	Yoshi2	taking away the color of my life
2017-07-20 20:30:21	Yoshi2	how rood
2017-07-20 20:46:26	@Espyo	just wait for Pikmin 4
2017-07-20 20:47:41	@Espyo	>should we make a new orange role?
2017-07-20 20:47:48	@Espyo	it's being discussed in the staff room
2017-07-20 20:47:50	@Espyo	congrats
2017-07-20 20:48:02	@Espyo	not because of me, though, KA just decided to ask that
2017-07-20 20:48:40	Yoshi2	yay
2017-07-20 20:49:46	@Espyo	welp
2017-07-20 20:49:53	@Espyo	there are no orange Pikmin
2017-07-20 20:49:58	@Espyo	the closest is the bomb-rock
2017-07-20 20:50:08	@Espyo	but if the Mushroom Pikmin role is special because it's different from standard Pikmin
2017-07-20 20:50:10	@Espyo	then bomb-rock is even more
2017-07-20 20:50:11	@Espyo	but
2017-07-20 20:50:15	@Espyo	KA suggested a spicy Pikmin
2017-07-20 20:50:17	@Espyo	don't see why not

2017-07-22 19:48:01	@Espyo	oh, there we go
2017-07-22 19:48:15	@Espyo	basically, cur_node was not being None, and it was pointing at unallocated data
2017-07-22 19:48:24	@Espyo	eesh
2017-07-22 20:01:44	Yoshi2	without the full code i have trouble imagining stuff
2017-07-22 20:07:10	@Espyo	yeah, sorry
2017-07-22 20:07:15	@Espyo	but I got it fixed
2017-07-22 20:07:21	@Espyo	that's what I meant by my "oh, there we go"
2017-07-22 20:12:40	Testyo	I think is garbage
2017-07-22 20:24:50	Yoshi2	nice testyo

2017-07-22 22:05:02	Yoshi2	all the important people with lots of SMS knowledge either left to do other games or no longer want to deal with it
2017-07-22 22:06:51	Yoshi2	leaving the owner who no longer has time for it
2017-07-22 22:07:30	Yoshi2	so the forum and discord are going to be read-only so it doesn't have to be moderated and knowledge isn't lost
2017-07-22 22:08:36	Yoshi2	there is a replacement discord made by a member on which I've secured myself a moderator spot in :>

2017-07-23 13:27:43	Yoshi2	"they just all started to leave so quickly?

2017-07-23 14:05:15	@Espyo	eh, "few weeks" still seems a bit quick
2017-07-23 14:13:28	Yoshi2	I have only been there for few months at most so *shrug*
2017-07-23 14:13:53	Yoshi2	maybe they have been losing interest in sunshine for some time now and decided to pull out
2017-07-23 14:14:49	@Espyo	that's probably it

2017-07-24 19:47:52	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-07-24 19:47:52	Testyo	Also my second Bob Ross painting came out of advice
2017-07-24 19:48:19	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-24 20:03:34	Yoshi2	http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17735 mmmm a tutorial for making cheat engine work better with dolphin and it actually works
2017-07-24 20:03:40	Yoshi2	finally float searches will be possible
2017-07-24 20:10:37	@Espyo	ooh
2017-07-24 20:11:05	Yoshi2	there was another on smashboards but that had CE scripts that were broken for me
2017-07-24 20:12:14	@Espyo	oh boy, that looks more like a class than a tutorial
2017-07-24 20:22:58	Claris_	"EDIT: as of Dolphin 5.0-3981, it will randomnise the start address on every platform (Windows and Linux) so you CANNOT use the recommended method I talk about in this post"
2017-07-24 20:23:00	Claris_	WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY
2017-07-24 20:25:41	@Espyo	good question
2017-07-24 20:28:34	Yoshi2	I have an older revision so I'm fine but yeah, that really sucks
2017-07-24 20:52:33	@Espyo	J: you know that bot you made to help move the wikia to Pikipedia? you wouldn't happen to have its files there, would you?
2017-07-24 20:52:40	@Espyo	I don't need the bot, I actually need what it fetched

2017-07-24 22:10:48	@Espyo	thanks
2017-07-24 22:18:38	@J	hmm, looks like when I moved my documents folder when getting an SSD, the old backups got deleted, so it only goes back to November 2016
2017-07-24 22:21:33	@Espyo	oh
2017-07-24 22:21:35	@Espyo	oh well
2017-07-24 22:21:46	@Espyo	see, I was looking for the pages where we discussed wikia's new layout, back in 2010
2017-07-24 22:21:56	@Espyo	since wikia staff deleted that conversation out of spite one day
2017-07-24 22:41:33	@J	you can't see it on the old wiki?
2017-07-24 22:43:11	@Espyo	nope, deleted
2017-07-24 22:43:16	@Espyo	and apparently it didn't go through to Pikipedia
2017-07-24 22:46:05	@J	oh, are we not admins there any more?
2017-07-24 22:46:44	@J	have you tried wayback?
2017-07-24 23:01:18	@Espyo	we're not admins, no
2017-07-24 23:01:21	@Espyo	heck, I've been banned
2017-07-24 23:01:27	@Espyo	actually, you could be an admin, still
2017-07-24 23:01:28	@Espyo	dunno
2017-07-24 23:01:36	@Espyo	anyway, I haven't tried wbm, but I also don't know what the pages were called
2017-07-24 23:24:31	@Espyo	yeah, no dice, searching on wbm is far too hard if you don't know the name of the blog post
2017-07-24 23:24:43	@Espyo	...wait, isn't there a log of deleted pages somewhere?
2017-07-24 23:24:46	@Espyo	can anon users see it?
2017-07-24 23:25:41	@Espyo	Special:Log/delete, I see

2017-07-25 20:38:52	Testyo	Especially after what Panne, Laurent...
2017-07-25 20:40:17	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-25 20:48:34	Yoshi2	today I've been busy figuring addresses out https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291956181554167808/339494050132525057/unknown.png
2017-07-25 20:48:42	Yoshi2	for a thing in impact site
2017-07-25 20:54:15	@Espyo	a thiiiing
2017-07-25 20:54:29	@Espyo	hey, but it looks like you just jumped right in on the opportunity
2017-07-25 20:54:31	@Espyo	godspeed
2017-07-25 20:58:58	Yoshi2	sadly no success
2017-07-25 20:59:10	Yoshi2	moving the parts makes the pikmin drop them
2017-07-25 20:59:26	@Espyo	...
2017-07-25 20:59:34	Yoshi2	unless there is a different address controlling the position of the carried object + pikmin as a whole
2017-07-25 21:15:54	Yoshi2	CE works pretty well here
2017-07-25 21:16:15	Yoshi2	but needs a plugin to offset the addresses starting at 0x7FFF0000 to 0x80000000
2017-07-25 21:16:30	@Espyo	poo
2017-07-25 21:16:36	Yoshi2	and dolphin without randomized starting addresses is best
2017-07-25 21:25:54	@Espyo	I bet
2017-07-25 22:25:15	@Espyo	const float far;
2017-07-25 22:25:20	@Espyo	if(far == 0) return NULL;
2017-07-25 22:25:29	@Espyo	visual studio is giving me an error that the == is a syntax error
2017-07-25 22:25:32	@Espyo	this program is so good
2017-07-25 22:25:38	@Espyo	now, here's what's going to happen
2017-07-25 22:25:43	@Espyo	I'm going to press F7 again to compile again
2017-07-25 22:25:45	@Espyo	and just like that
2017-07-25 22:25:50	@Espyo	it's suddenly NOT going to be a syntax error
2017-07-25 22:26:06	@Espyo	...it still is
2017-07-25 22:26:23	@Espyo	...what
2017-07-25 22:26:37	@Espyo	"far" is a DEFINE defined somewhere
2017-07-25 22:26:47	@Espyo	who in their right mind creates a define called something so common
2017-07-25 22:26:52	@Espyo	microsoft, that's who
2017-07-25 22:26:58	@Espyo	since this doesn't bloody happen on Linux when I compiled
2017-07-25 22:27:45	@Espyo	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa984844(v=vs.71).aspx I have to go around and tickle my compiler just to fix this idiocity

2017-07-30 13:07:12	@Espyo	hah, nice
2017-07-30 13:07:15	@Espyo	and then it gets reverted
2017-07-30 13:18:28	Yoshi2	Best method i know for getting rid of wikia's sidebar, and all the clutter.
2017-07-30 13:18:29	Yoshi2	    Step 1: Go to http://en.kancollewiki.net/wiki/Kancolle_Wiki
2017-07-30 13:18:29	Yoshi2	    Step 2: There is no step 2.
2017-07-30 13:19:21	Yoshi2	best advice
2017-07-30 13:20:45	@Espyo	hehe yeah

2017-07-30 14:59:23	Yoshi2	amen, mate
2017-07-30 15:04:10	@Espyo	sad but true :(
2017-07-30 15:07:46	Yoshi2	i have to add all the custom model instructions that've been talked about 1000 times in the sms hacking community to the technical knowledge base and then yell at people to do some custom levels
2017-07-30 15:07:58	Yoshi2	inb4 "b-but custom carrying paths"
2017-07-30 15:09:47	@Espyo	but
2017-07-30 15:09:51	@Espyo	custom carrying paths are easy, anyway
2017-07-30 15:10:08	Yoshi2	writing the program for it isn't
2017-07-30 15:10:44	Yoshi2	you write the program for it, next thing will be "i want an overlay of my level in it"
2017-07-30 15:12:38	@Espyo	why can't I just repurpose my engine? :thinking:
2017-07-30 15:12:53	@Espyo	it's already got a way to draw carrying paths, and a way to overlay a reference image
2017-07-30 15:16:00	Yoshi2	I'll cheer you on if you can manage it
2017-07-30 15:18:47	@Espyo	I'd just have to add a new load/save format
2017-07-30 15:19:09	@Espyo	hm, and also add support to the stop radii
2017-07-30 15:19:19	@Espyo	still don't know what the radius is used for, so I never implemented it in the engine
2017-07-30 15:26:56	Yoshi2	that's not something we have tested yet, right?
2017-07-30 15:31:29	@Espyo	yeah, untested so far
2017-07-30 16:06:48	Yoshi2	FUUUCK i cut my finger and it hurts
2017-07-30 16:08:44	@Espyo	ouch man
2017-07-30 16:08:47	@Espyo	what with?
2017-07-30 16:38:23	Yoshi2	knife
2017-07-30 16:40:14	@Espyo	what were you trying to do?
2017-07-30 16:40:16	@Espyo	force a can open?
2017-07-30 16:44:44	Yoshi2	I would never do that 
2017-07-30 16:44:50	Yoshi2	(or i would use a butterknife)
2017-07-30 16:52:06	Yoshi2	I was cleaning the knife and by accident my finger went along the edge

2017-07-31 19:26:17	Testyo	Greetings everyone!
2017-07-31 20:09:41	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-07-31 20:09:41	Testyo	what I wanted to do is confirm where the edge data starts based on some header data
2017-07-31 20:10:42	@Espyo	hi
2017-07-31 20:10:49	@Espyo	is your finger better?
2017-07-31 20:19:57	Yoshi2	didn't heal completely yet
2017-07-31 20:22:20	@Espyo	still hurt?
2017-07-31 20:28:07	Yoshi2	it hurt when I thought I would be fine without a bandaid earlier today
2017-07-31 20:41:43	@Espyo	ech
2017-07-31 21:03:24	Yoshi2	the moment i touched something it started hurting again >-<
2017-07-31 21:03:41	Yoshi2	so now I'm keeping a bandaid on till it heals fully
2017-07-31 21:07:39	@Espyo	it's a bit weird though, you shouldn't need one for more than like 6 hours
2017-07-31 21:07:43	@Espyo	well, I mean
2017-07-31 21:07:47	@Espyo	bandaids are to stop bleeding
2017-07-31 21:07:50	@Espyo	looks like you have a bruise
2017-07-31 21:07:57	@Espyo	the bandaid would help protect, I guess
2017-07-31 21:14:59	Yoshi2	to be more precise, it didn't just start hurting but also started bleeding again

2017-07-31 21:15:21	Yoshi2	so the cut didn't heal properly yet
2017-07-31 21:17:24	@Espyo	oh
2017-07-31 21:18:06	Yoshi2	and there was a question about bms in pikmin hacking and i answered
2017-07-31 21:18:19	Yoshi2	and it was pushed all the way up by other people talking
2017-07-31 21:18:42	Yoshi2	¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
2017-07-31 21:20:41	@Espyo	yup.

2017-08-01 19:45:18	Testyo	it's night
2017-08-01 19:46:28	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-01 19:46:32	@Espyo	it isn't, Testyo
2017-08-01 19:46:32	Testyo	That will be a problem for me then
2017-08-01 19:46:41	@Espyo	pfft, how come, Testyo?
2017-08-01 19:46:41	Testyo	you read it in the town and some characters really forgetable
2017-08-01 19:49:25	Yoshi2	today I have been messing with simple triangle group generation for the collision
2017-08-01 19:51:07	@Espyo	any luck?
2017-08-01 19:52:22	Yoshi2	some
2017-08-01 21:06:00	Yoshi2	I have figured out the purpose of the remaining few values in the collision
2017-08-01 21:06:09	Yoshi2	and I can kinda generate those vertex groups
2017-08-01 21:08:59	@Espyo	oh, nice
2017-08-01 21:14:39	Yoshi2	but it has gaps in them
2017-08-01 21:14:45	Yoshi2	not sure why yet

2017-08-02 20:06:15	Yoshi2	the bw discord server got an influx of new people, I think due to the owner who has 1.5k subs or so making a video about it

2017-08-03 20:25:23	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-08-03 20:25:23	Testyo	I unfriended him the problem
2017-08-03 20:29:50	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-03 21:12:22	Yoshi2	I hit over 100 subscribers now
2017-08-03 21:12:31	Yoshi2	I feel forced to do a new video :I
2017-08-03 21:17:28	@Espyo	woop!
2017-08-03 21:17:32	@Espyo	eh, don't force out videos
2017-08-03 21:17:36	@Espyo	forced videos are normally crap
2017-08-03 21:42:50	Yoshi2	i wonder if this emoji thing was a mistake https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230572328344354816/342769209668796416/unknown.png
2017-08-03 21:47:55	Testyo	in all seriousness, I DID save sure
2017-08-03 21:52:33	@Espyo	looks like a spoopy portrait of a foot soldier
2017-08-03 21:52:44	@Espyo	and then the reactions

2017-08-03 22:36:30	@Espyo	hmm, not as spoopy as I thought
2017-08-03 22:36:40	@Espyo	but still kinda that early, not quite there yet, slightly uncanny valley, CGI

2017-08-04 19:18:05	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-08-04 19:18:06	Testyo	ALSO I SHALL DO MY FRIEND
2017-08-04 19:22:51	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-04 20:04:27	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9xP56_V0M8 must watch
2017-08-04 20:06:06	@Espyo	heh, funny thing about that
2017-08-04 20:06:12	@Espyo	I started watching some 10 minutes ago
2017-08-04 20:06:19	@Espyo	then had to pause
2017-08-04 20:06:36	@Espyo	because I had to finish a level in Hey! Pikmin, so I would try to see if the Sparklium Springs were open at exactly 20:03
2017-08-04 20:06:40	@Espyo	since that's exactly when I used them yesterday
2017-08-04 20:06:49	@Espyo	(Sparklium Springs are only available once every few hours)
2017-08-04 20:07:02	@Espyo	turns out it was already open, which means you need less than 24 hours to re-open a visited spring
2017-08-04 20:07:14	@Espyo	now that I'm finished with that, I was going to resume the video
2017-08-04 20:07:16	@Espyo	until you posted it too
2017-08-04 20:07:23	@Espyo	good stuff my man
2017-08-04 20:11:46	Yoshi2	I live for that
2017-08-04 20:12:03	Yoshi2	stuff that is kinda still in the game but not really but with lots of work it can be brought back
2017-08-04 20:19:46	@Espyo	what does he mean he doesn't know what that number is in decimal?
2017-08-04 20:19:48	@Espyo	this man works in hexa?
2017-08-04 20:19:53	@Espyo	yeah, I love it
2017-08-04 20:19:57	@Espyo	but I'm no good at finding it

2017-08-04 20:51:41	Yoshi2	start modding/reverse engineering and eventually you'll stumble upon some stuff
2017-08-04 20:54:37	@Espyo	yeah, but I suck at reverse engineering, that's the thing
2017-08-04 20:58:58	Yoshi2	pfff
2017-08-04 20:59:21	Yoshi2	i bet you just don't want to sell your soul to the devil and stare at ASM for hours without end
2017-08-04 21:01:51	@Espyo	well, partially that
2017-08-04 21:01:59	@Espyo	but even when I tried to reverse engineer simple formats
2017-08-04 21:02:04	@Espyo	I don't even know where to start
2017-08-04 21:11:34	Yoshi2	get as many examples of the format as possible, sort them by size and try to make sense of the smaller files
2017-08-04 21:16:00	@Espyo	hm, I suppose
2017-08-04 21:18:42	Yoshi2	get a hex editor, look at what's the same and what's different
2017-08-04 21:19:32	Yoshi2	some values look like length of the data that follows, some are pointers to data in the file
2017-08-04 21:21:19	Yoshi2	some values can be floats
2017-08-04 21:22:47	@Espyo	right, I get the theory
2017-08-04 21:22:51	@Espyo	but actually finding that?
2017-08-04 21:23:23	@Espyo	even if I know I'm meant to find a table of entries with basic data
2017-08-04 21:23:53	@Espyo	ANY ONE of the bytes in the file could be either the number of entries, or a table of data offsets, or the length of each entry in the table, or any other metadata thing
2017-08-04 21:24:04	@Espyo	bonus points if the devs use some weird way to write table metadata
2017-08-04 21:24:42	@Espyo	like "if a byte is 00, the next entry is located right here and is only one byte long, but if it's not, then that byte represents the data offset, and the entry is 5 bytes long"
2017-08-04 21:24:47	@Espyo	in the world could I guess that?
2017-08-04 21:24:56	@Espyo	and that is for types of files with content I know of
2017-08-04 21:25:06	@Espyo	if I'm trying to understand, for instance, how a menu file is stored
2017-08-04 21:25:12	@Espyo	there are hundreds of ways of saving menu info
2017-08-04 21:25:30	@Espyo	from having a list of menu elements, each with a type, X/Y, size, etc.
2017-08-04 21:25:53	@Espyo	to having a list of menu elements in the first row, an identifier that means the next row only takes up half of the screen space, the list of items in the next row, etc.
2017-08-04 21:26:03	@Espyo	to something like HTML notation, but in byte form instead of text form
2017-08-04 21:26:14	@Espyo	it's ridiculous
2017-08-04 21:34:49	Yoshi2	use occam's razor
2017-08-04 21:35:33	Yoshi2	files need to be easy to parse so at least the general structure is simple to figure out
2017-08-04 21:41:59	Yoshi2	variable length data is a bitch to parse and usually only used in cases where it's supposed to be read from the start
2017-08-04 21:42:02	Yoshi2	e.g. BMS
2017-08-04 21:51:08	Yoshi2	occam's razor is probably the best advice for what you said
2017-08-04 21:51:24	Yoshi2	don't let your mind go crazy
2017-08-04 21:52:52	@Espyo	hmm...
2017-08-04 21:52:54	@Espyo	you're right
2017-08-04 21:52:58	@Espyo	I should give it another go
2017-08-04 21:53:12	@Espyo	I can't remember what the last format I tried to reverse engineer was

2017-08-05 21:02:48	@Espyo	yup
2017-08-05 21:03:00	Yoshi2	and i have to come in and tell that yes it is possible
2017-08-05 21:04:23	@Espyo	...wait what?
2017-08-05 21:04:31	@Espyo	when did it become possible?
2017-08-05 21:18:38	Yoshi2	since i started preaching about flaaffy (a midi->bms converter for SMS that also works well with pikmin 2)
2017-08-05 21:21:26	@Espyo	wow

2017-08-05 21:35:06	Yoshi2	i thought i talked about that with you once
2017-08-05 21:35:18	Yoshi2	... in fact, I thought I recorded a video about a custom music piece

2017-08-05 21:41:49	Yoshi2	oh, i guess i never made a video just for it

2017-08-11 19:06:04	@Espyo	phoo
2017-08-11 19:06:06	@Espyo	got scared shitless
2017-08-11 19:06:19	@Espyo	my system wasn't sending sound to the headset
2017-08-11 19:06:21	@Espyo	nor my earphones
2017-08-11 19:06:24	@Espyo	but it could play through the laptop speakers
2017-08-11 19:06:56	@Espyo	I figured "welp, time to either send it off to warranty, or format it because the system is buggered :) this is a great way to spend my 4-day vacation :) :) :)"
2017-08-11 19:07:00	@Espyo	but thankfully, a reboot did the trick
2017-08-11 19:10:31	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ2pu_VGAEo I did a thing in mario kart dd
2017-08-11 19:12:23	@Espyo	oh, is this related to the wall shenanigans then?
2017-08-11 19:12:33	Yoshi2	indeed
2017-08-11 19:13:56	@Espyo	amazin'
2017-08-11 19:14:20	@Espyo	what in the world did you do exactly, then?
2017-08-11 20:25:31	Yoshi2	what I did is go over each triangle and change one of the values associated with it
2017-08-11 20:26:34	Yoshi2	specifically, one float
2017-08-11 20:26:41	Yoshi2	that I set to -99999 for all triangles
2017-08-11 20:26:45	Yoshi2	which made the walls go away
2017-08-11 20:27:42	@Espyo	heh

2017-08-12 12:57:38	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-12 14:03:19	Yoshi2	turns out "Rabbit" and "Escape" are MKDD's internal names for Shine Thief
2017-08-12 14:03:26	Yoshi2	rabbit = somebody who has the shine
2017-08-12 14:04:18	@Espyo	oh, heh
2017-08-12 14:04:52	Yoshi2	the unused/cut game mode is RobberyBattle
2017-08-12 14:06:15	@Espyo	RobberyBattle...
2017-08-12 14:06:25	@Espyo	it still kinda sounds like MK8D's new mode
2017-08-12 14:06:35	Yoshi2	probably
2017-08-12 14:07:57	Yoshi2	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/337658011369865218/345851292670885888/unknown.png all the rank-checking functions in one place
2017-08-12 14:09:22	Yoshi2	4 battle modes, one race, one for awards

2017-08-12 14:41:50	Yoshi2	I assume the mario sprite was supposed to be the icon for the robbery mode
2017-08-12 14:42:27	Yoshi2	and the weird stretched graphics was supposed to be the title
2017-08-12 14:45:25	@Espyo	oh, nice
2017-08-12 14:48:14	Yoshi2	but forcing the mode to be robbery crashes the game
2017-08-12 14:48:20	Yoshi2	I wonder if it can be made work
2017-08-12 15:01:57	@Espyo	it really feels like it can be fixed
2017-08-12 15:02:00	@Espyo	it has to
2017-08-12 15:16:44	Yoshi2	thank god for this debug map
2017-08-12 15:16:54	Yoshi2	which doesn't fit but it kinda fits if you look closely for the functions
2017-08-12 15:20:41	@Espyo	uh
2017-08-12 15:20:48	@Espyo	you mean the debug map fits for Robbery Mode?
2017-08-12 15:33:20	Yoshi2	the debug map fits in some parts for the function map generated by dolphin
2017-08-12 15:33:27	Yoshi2	if you go by order and function sizes

2017-08-13 15:32:20	Testyo	jump, spot dodge, release, or roll right would cause DH to search Pikmin on imdb
2017-08-13 15:32:28	@Espyo	he's back to his random self
2017-08-13 15:32:35	@Espyo	see, that's why I love this feature so much
2017-08-13 15:32:37	@Espyo	it's just random nonsense
2017-08-13 15:32:38	@Espyo	but sometimes
2017-08-13 15:32:47	@Espyo	it's FRIGHTENINGLY concise and on-topic
2017-08-13 15:33:02	@Espyo	neural network? pssh, I've got a better idea: pure randomness
2017-08-13 15:33:13	@Espyo	Testyo: save moment HAHA we doing today 12
2017-08-13 15:33:14	Testyo	Done. I saved this 12 line moment, from <Testyo> HAHA we doing today, then? to <Yoshi2> i'm cracking up. (Moment #336)

2017-08-14 12:16:42	Testyo	Afternoon everyone!
2017-08-14 13:20:46	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-08-14 13:20:47	Testyo	okay though
2017-08-14 13:23:33	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-14 13:45:12	Yoshi2	investigating stuff helpful for custom music
2017-08-14 13:45:36	Yoshi2	and jimble is having some success with my direction
2017-08-14 14:13:09	@Espyo	woop
2017-08-14 14:19:07	Yoshi2	soo if I understand this right, pikmin 2 has 6 instrument banks numbering 0 to 5
2017-08-14 14:19:59	Yoshi2	it has 49 files containing the sounds numbering 0 to 46
2017-08-14 14:20:01	Yoshi2	*48
2017-08-14 14:20:11	Yoshi2	not all sounds are loaded
2017-08-14 14:20:20	Yoshi2	each sound has a wave id
2017-08-14 14:20:34	Yoshi2	instrument banks contain programs (basically the instruments)
2017-08-14 14:20:43	Yoshi2	the programs reference the wave ids
2017-08-14 14:21:57	Yoshi2	not all programs in an instrument bank can be played at once because some sounds just aren't loaded
2017-08-14 14:30:43	Yoshi2	so if you have the sounds (which can be dumped through some hoops with flaaffy) and you have the instrument bank information (which can also be dumped through some hoops with flaaffy) you can check the sound numbers, compare them against the instrument bank info and see which bank contains the programs that play that sound (and other sounds from the same wscene, I'm sure)

2017-08-14 16:00:32	Testyo	Hey yup
2017-08-14 16:01:10	Yoshi2	Espyo: does what I said about instruments make sense?
2017-08-14 16:02:13	@Espyo	I... think so
2017-08-14 16:02:31	@Espyo	from what I remember, that's pretty much it
2017-08-14 16:02:39	@Espyo	Claris: soundbank mania or Sonic Mania?

2017-08-14 17:12:28	Yoshi2	wanna hear some craziness from MKDD?
2017-08-14 17:13:57	Yoshi2	in the collision file the normal is stored as 3 signed shorts
2017-08-14 17:14:06	Yoshi2	ranging from -10000 to 10000
2017-08-14 17:14:13	Yoshi2	*the normal of triangles
2017-08-14 17:14:49	Yoshi2	fixed point decimal with 4 digits after the point
2017-08-14 17:16:54	@Espyo	ok, so far so good...
2017-08-14 17:19:59	Yoshi2	not crazy enough?
2017-08-14 17:20:05	Yoshi2	ok how about the next thing
2017-08-14 17:20:12	Yoshi2	it uses one byte as a look-up table
2017-08-14 17:20:29	Yoshi2	to store which vertices of the triangle have the biggest or smallest X/Z values

2017-08-14 18:06:21	Yoshi2	https://github.com/RenolY2/mkdd-collision/blob/master/collision_format.txt today figured out the remaining pieces of the puzzle for MKDD's collision
2017-08-14 18:06:33	Yoshi2	well, the pieces that matter for collision
2017-08-14 18:10:55	@Espyo	woop
2017-08-14 18:17:24	Yoshi2	now it'll be up to the other guy I work with to do the converter

2017-08-15 17:11:17	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/juEqO5D.png those are some difficult questions (not that I don't know the answer to them, it's all about that balance between being strict and not too strict)
2017-08-15 17:15:22	@Espyo	yeah, they're meant to be kind of ambiguous

2017-08-16 19:55:04	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-08-16 19:55:05	Testyo	The glitch with Brittany in the cave is getting on my nerves, lol. I can't reproduce it wants
2017-08-16 19:58:37	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-16 20:31:50	Yoshi2	well the guy I was working with on the MKDD collision decided he couldn't do much more and gave up
2017-08-16 20:32:08	Yoshi2	there is somebody else who is willing to do the collision converter but it still makes me a bit sad :<
2017-08-16 21:27:17	@Espyo	wow
2017-08-16 21:27:19	@Espyo	that's kinda sudden
2017-08-16 21:28:45	Yoshi2	he already did something like that once before but we brought him back
2017-08-16 21:28:53	@Espyo	pfft
2017-08-16 21:28:57	Yoshi2	and he told me how he felt yesterday so I had an idea this was coming
2017-08-16 21:29:43	@Espyo	hm, just life getting him down in general?
2017-08-16 21:30:31	Yoshi2	no idea but he said he felt terrible about how he got me into the custom collision thing and I did all the reverse engineering work and he couldn't do anything
2017-08-16 21:31:17	@Espyo	hmm
2017-08-16 21:31:24	@Espyo	well, everyone does what they can, for how long they like...
2017-08-16 21:37:27	Yoshi2	yup
2017-08-16 21:37:42	Yoshi2	now I have to teach the other guy about the details of the format
2017-08-16 21:39:04	@Espyo	and THAT is why knowledge bases are important :|
2017-08-16 21:59:16	Yoshi2	i am the knowledge base
2017-08-16 21:59:35	Yoshi2	i actually had notes prepared on the format but apparently they weren't clear enough :<
2017-08-16 22:01:30	Yoshi2	the full stuff will probably go onto the custom mario kart wiki when everything goes fine (it actually has most info right now except the grid/quadtree structure)
2017-08-16 22:03:57	@Espyo	oh yeah, that's a thing

2017-08-19 12:42:56	Testyo	Afternoon everyone!
2017-08-19 13:11:44	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-08-19 13:11:44	Testyo	This will be careless/unlucky
2017-08-19 13:11:48	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-19 13:19:02	Yoshi2	the amount of new mods pikcord already has is pretty decent. Any further mods will probably be for redundancy and covering each other's "shifts"
2017-08-19 13:44:59	@Espyo	yeah
2017-08-19 13:45:01	@Espyo	which isn't a bad thing
2017-08-19 13:58:15	Yoshi2	indeed
2017-08-19 16:50:39	Yoshi2	I found another script written by nwplayer
2017-08-19 16:50:50	Yoshi2	again, butchered python code, ughh
2017-08-19 16:57:46	@Espyo	heh
2017-08-19 19:23:08	Yoshi2	here's the best invention since sliced bread: http://kuribo64.net/board/thread.php?pid=86721
2017-08-19 19:23:39	Yoshi2	with wit you can extract pikmin 2 into a folder and if you set it up like that you can run pikmin 2 from a folder
2017-08-19 19:32:56	Yoshi2	unlike the older method with setting the apploader path this actually works with pikmin 2 and is easy
2017-08-19 19:39:37	@Espyo	oh, I have to try it then
2017-08-19 19:39:41	@Espyo	but what about the lag people are reporting?
2017-08-19 19:41:22	Yoshi2	i haven't checked that yet
2017-08-19 19:43:20	Yoshi2	first test, if there's lag then it's not bad enough to break the game for me
2017-08-19 19:45:46	Yoshi2	yeah I'm not noticing any mahjor lag
2017-08-19 19:46:54	Yoshi2	*major
2017-08-19 20:00:38	@Espyo	that's good
2017-08-19 20:00:40	@Espyo	man, I have to try it
2017-08-19 20:06:20	Yoshi2	I'd write it on the pikcord but it would just get burried under the hey pikmin people :L
2017-08-19 20:20:58	@Espyo	write it on the tKB
2017-08-19 20:36:03	Yoshi2	easier said than done because there's the question of "where?"
2017-08-19 20:36:37	Yoshi2	the tkb needs an overhaul on the introduction pages
2017-08-19 20:57:27	@Espyo	instructions page
2017-08-19 20:57:32	@Espyo	probably the "global" one
2017-08-19 20:57:36	@Espyo	since it can be used for P1 as well
2017-08-19 20:57:41	@Espyo	and yes, it does

2017-08-20 14:51:26	Testyo	at least with the world am I asking?
2017-08-20 14:52:05	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-20 18:30:49	Yoshi2	https://github.com/RenolY2/blojob I forked blojob so in case I ever get around to it I might add support for pikmin's BLO2 format used in its .blo files
2017-08-20 18:34:30	@Espyo	heh, dat name
2017-08-20 18:34:41	@Espyo	blo files in P2?
2017-08-20 18:34:51	@Espyo	I thought there were blo files in P1, and they were just the voyage log entries
2017-08-20 19:16:36	Yoshi2	pikmin 2 also has blo files
2017-08-20 19:32:39	@Espyo	what are they fore?
2017-08-20 19:32:41	@Espyo	*-e
2017-08-20 19:45:17	Yoshi2	idk
2017-08-20 19:45:42	Yoshi2	can't open it with blojob because blojob only supports BLO1 :>

2017-08-22 20:13:29	@Espyo	right?
2017-08-22 20:59:02	Yoshi2	is there health care for people who looked too much at assembly

2017-08-23 22:21:53	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-08-23 22:21:53	Testyo	it worked WAY too well I don't want to only add the icon when there are warnings
2017-08-23 22:23:08	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-23 22:23:12	@Espyo	hey, this ain't working :| http://kuribo64.net/board/thread.php?pid=86721
2017-08-23 22:23:40	@Espyo	Dolphin doesn't recognize it, and after I ticked the subfolders option, it found a boot.dol, but won't do anything when trying to run that
2017-08-23 22:39:37	Yoshi2	Espyo: use the newest dev version of dolphin
2017-08-23 22:40:00	Yoshi2	the game from the folder shouldn't show up as a boot.dol, but a proper game with a size of 0 bytes
2017-08-23 22:44:24	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/APYyIIk.png
2017-08-23 22:51:39	@Espyo	aww man
2017-08-23 22:51:43	@Espyo	I don't wanna have to use a new version
2017-08-23 22:51:48	@Espyo	make all of my save states incompatible and such
2017-08-23 22:51:51	@Espyo	screw that
2017-08-23 22:52:02	@Espyo	when it makes its way to master and there's a big release, I'll use this feature
2017-08-23 22:52:30	@Espyo	oh yeah, it says the version on the thread, I didn't even notice
2017-08-23 22:52:31	@Espyo	sorry
2017-08-23 23:02:48	Yoshi2	my save states are incompatible anyway because I do modding all the time
2017-08-23 23:03:03	Yoshi2	so I'm not attached to my save states

2017-08-24 21:27:06	Yoshi2	some of the unknown triangle data in the collision is indices to other triangles
2017-08-24 21:27:13	Yoshi2	triangles
2017-08-24 21:27:19	Yoshi2	referencing other triangles
2017-08-24 21:27:21	Yoshi2	yo dawg
2017-08-24 21:40:24	@Espyo	but y
2017-08-24 21:41:41	Yoshi2	idk
2017-08-24 21:41:45	Yoshi2	but it's important
2017-08-24 21:41:50	Yoshi2	that's as much as I can say
2017-08-24 21:42:05	Yoshi2	3 triangle references per triangle
2017-08-24 21:43:13	@Espyo	neighbors?
2017-08-24 21:43:14	@Espyo	makes sense
2017-08-24 21:44:59	Yoshi2	maaaaaaybe
2017-08-24 21:52:08	Yoshi2	it's weird though. This can function with those values set to 0 or to 0xFFFF
2017-08-24 21:58:43	Testyo	and Dunno
2017-08-24 22:02:04	Yoshi2	hmm
2017-08-24 22:02:10	Yoshi2	well crap
2017-08-24 22:02:18	Yoshi2	this might actually be neighbours
2017-08-24 22:06:42	Yoshi2	idea on how to check who the neighbours are: Check which triangles share two same indices
2017-08-24 22:16:37	@Espyo	yeah, that should be enough
2017-08-24 22:16:43	@Espyo	but remember not to check 0 with 0, and 1 with 1
2017-08-24 22:16:50	@Espyo	since, you know, 1 can match with 0 and vice-versa

2017-08-25 20:56:05	Yoshi2	hi Testyo 
2017-08-25 20:56:05	Testyo	he's being a bit bullshit
2017-08-25 20:56:18	Yoshi2	rude
2017-08-25 20:59:03	@Espyo	wow
2017-08-25 21:00:04	Yoshi2	I decided to go differently about the MKDD triangle neighbour stuff
2017-08-25 21:00:12	Yoshi2	I took a level I had trouble with
2017-08-25 21:00:31	Yoshi2	modified its collision so that it had no triangle neighbours
2017-08-25 21:00:35	Yoshi2	and walls etc. were fine
2017-08-25 21:00:59	Yoshi2	so the collision issues I had were not due to triangle neighbours or even related to triangle data
2017-08-25 21:27:58	Yoshi2	there is one possibility how overlapping track sections work
2017-08-25 21:28:56	Yoshi2	the unknown data section at the end of the collision that we conveniently set to be empty might have something to do with it
2017-08-25 21:45:29	Yoshi2	when will this hell end

2017-08-27 12:39:24	Testyo	and I just felt like it true you have to hit your game to access the level select in Sonic 3D
2017-08-27 12:39:27	@Espyo	hi
2017-08-27 12:56:40	Yoshi2	structs in ida are sexy https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348164294128566282/351325229596803075/unknown.png

2017-08-27 13:07:26	@Espyo	hey, that's pretty good
2017-08-27 13:07:31	@Espyo	does it just know that some of those are padding?
2017-08-27 13:10:52	Yoshi2	no
2017-08-27 13:11:01	Yoshi2	I'm manually creating the struct

2017-08-27 15:32:26	Testyo	Well, Its just you come in expecting atleast 1 other hey
2017-08-27 16:32:31	Yoshi2	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348164294128566282/351387554714484736/unknown.png I found some addresses that I was able to match up with function names from the debug map
2017-08-27 16:32:35	Yoshi2	stuff looks prettier
2017-08-27 16:34:22	@Espyo	oh, nice
2017-08-27 18:24:47	Yoshi2	there's too much hey pikmin datamining :L
2017-08-27 18:24:58	@Espyo	heh
2017-08-27 18:30:53	Yoshi2	it's cool that it is happening but stuff will probably quiet down once everything's been found

2017-08-27 20:57:17	Yoshi2	sometimes I feel like moderating/leading a discord server is a lot about human resources management
2017-08-27 21:01:02	Yoshi2	or in other words, what to do so people don't burn out too quickly or deal with it properly
2017-08-27 21:09:21	@Espyo	yeah...
2017-08-27 21:09:28	@Espyo	it's nothing compared to moderating a wiki
2017-08-27 21:09:38	@Espyo	that's definitely more goal-oriented than human-oriented

2017-08-27 22:50:53	Yoshi2	oh, on secont thought it might not be useless after all
2017-08-27 22:51:04	Yoshi2	because the r4 register can be used by that subroutine being called

2017-08-28 21:57:28	Yoshi2	because custom tracks need to be set up
2017-08-28 21:57:45	Yoshi2	pikmin 2 doesn't need that much besides object placement and routes

2017-09-13 19:28:36	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2017-09-13 19:28:51	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-09-13 19:28:52	Testyo	Or at least where I guess
2017-09-13 19:30:06	Yoshi2	I acquired sony vegas today
2017-09-13 19:30:21	Yoshi2	definitely legally, i swear :L
2017-09-13 19:30:36	Yoshi2	i will finally be able to make that one video I wanted to make
2017-09-13 19:32:08	@Espyo	hi
2017-09-13 19:32:13	@Espyo	heh
2017-09-13 19:32:20	@Espyo	it's okay, I acquired Vegas too at some point
2017-09-13 19:32:24	@Espyo	I just use kdenlive now
2017-09-13 19:32:27	@Espyo	can't recommend it enough
2017-09-13 19:36:07	Yoshi2	linux is not my main system so linux editors are not an option for me
2017-09-13 19:58:17	@Espyo	ah, but here's the catch
2017-09-13 19:58:23	@Espyo	it went windows too some months ago
2017-09-13 20:03:40	Yoshi2	>beta
2017-09-13 20:03:42	Yoshi2	mmmmm
2017-09-13 20:16:48	@Espyo	don't knock it till you try it
2017-09-13 20:16:56	@Espyo	I mean, you can either take the safe route and use Vegas
2017-09-13 20:17:04	@Espyo	and burn your soul because you acquired it legally
2017-09-13 20:17:08	@Espyo	or use something free
2017-09-13 20:17:10	@Espyo	and...beta
2017-09-13 21:08:27	Yoshi2	hmmm not bad
2017-09-13 21:10:59	Yoshi2	apparently i cannot add images https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/322355715287023616/357619125650194434/unknown.png
2017-09-13 21:15:28	@Espyo	...RIP?
2017-09-13 21:15:29	@Espyo	that's weird
2017-09-13 21:15:33	@Espyo	I can do it just fine
2017-09-13 21:15:36	@Espyo	(Linux, but still)
2017-09-13 21:22:54	Yoshi2	not sure if I had to restart or if adding ffmpeg myself did the work (though it already came with ffmpeg so idk)
2017-09-13 21:22:57	Yoshi2	but it works now
2017-09-13 21:24:49	Yoshi2	still not entirely convinced it is better yet
2017-09-13 21:33:45	@Espyo	I didn't say it was better
2017-09-13 21:46:18	Yoshi2	so i will continue with vegas for now

2017-09-27 22:59:22	Testyo	what do anything
2017-09-27 23:21:04	@Espyo	J: just realized there's still no download for gcedit under windows, and that you've made a commit as little as 4 months ago
2017-09-27 23:21:17	@Espyo	now that the Pikmin hacking scene is kicking off, people are struggling with the likes of gcr
2017-09-27 23:21:29	@Espyo	I've sent them the windows .exe you've sent me a long time ago, but you may want to start making that public
2017-09-27 23:21:39	@Espyo	even if it is carrying a bunch of bloated libraries, it's better than nothing
2017-09-27 23:55:20	@J	I see
2017-09-27 23:55:22	@J	well, you see
2017-09-27 23:55:24	@J	I am lazy
2017-09-27 23:55:29	@J	as lazy as possible
2017-09-27 23:55:50	@J	so
2017-09-27 23:55:58	@J	they could just switch OS
2017-09-27 23:56:02	@J	less effort for me
2017-09-27 23:59:24	@J	well, no promises, but if you say people want something I could try to look into it
2017-09-27 23:59:52	@J	going to sleep now though, so goodnight

2017-10-01 17:44:30	@Espyo	I also can't just up and throw the source code because it's just too unstable
2017-10-01 17:44:38	Chiptheblewcat	~~what if we announced it on the announcements~~
2017-10-01 17:44:41	@Espyo	not only are some parts completely wrong, and held together with spit and hope

2017-10-01 17:44:56	Testyo	... except for the LOL
2017-10-01 17:45:11	TheRealKirbyzAdventure	a fun toy you say

2017-10-01 17:45:57	Chiptheblewcat	the hey! images could be announced if it wasnt already..
2017-10-01 17:46:04	@Espyo	oh, that's what you meant
2017-10-01 17:46:04	TheRealKirbyzAdventure	they do in pikcord
2017-10-01 17:46:05	Chiptheblewcat	since that would help everyone here out 
2017-10-01 17:46:22	@Espyo	I suppose... I just don't like pestering anybody about the wiki
2017-10-01 17:46:30	@Espyo	a vast majority of people don't care about helping the wiki at all
2017-10-01 17:46:49	TheRealKirbyzAdventure	if you port testyo i might consider letting it slide...
2017-10-01 17:46:49	Testyo	bleh, I hope next meem
2017-10-01 17:46:49	Chiptheblewcat	but a vast majority would enjoy a better place to read about pikmin..
2017-10-01 17:47:13	TheRealKirbyzAdventure	i cared about the wiki for maybe a month
2017-10-01 17:47:18	Chiptheblewcat	it will help basically everyone..
2017-10-01 17:48:06	Chiptheblewcat	therefore, you can slowly relax more on your engine instead of rushing out images yourself, and then you can port testyo or whateer
2017-10-01 17:48:06	Testyo	This is the worst name like 6
2017-10-01 17:48:21	@Espyo	you'd be surprised, Chip

2017-10-01 17:48:32	@Espyo	but wouldn't care about helping it
2017-10-01 17:48:42	@Espyo	if it's a good place, good, but if it becomes outdated, well, that sucks
2017-10-01 17:48:44	@Espyo	that's what people think ^
2017-10-01 17:48:58	Chiptheblewcat	but there will be people who will obviously help..
2017-10-01 17:49:04	Chiptheblewcat	it doesn't have to be everyone.
2017-10-01 17:49:06	@Espyo	yes
2017-10-01 17:49:17	@Espyo	though I don't really trust that the help would be worth it
2017-10-01 17:49:23	Chiptheblewcat	why not?
2017-10-01 17:49:27	@Espyo	I can imagine like 3 or 4 people uploading a total of like 10 images
2017-10-01 17:49:31	@Espyo	and then grow bored and stop
2017-10-01 17:49:38	@Espyo	since they've already done their part, they'll move on
2017-10-01 17:49:40	@Espyo	and while that is a bit of a help
2017-10-01 17:49:40	Chiptheblewcat	that's a large amount though/
2017-10-01 17:49:46	@Espyo	it doesn't help much more than like half an hour of work
2017-10-01 17:49:47	Chiptheblewcat	thats like 40 images.
2017-10-01 17:49:58	Chiptheblewcat	thats alot, espyo.
2017-10-01 17:49:58	@Espyo	I meant a total of 10, not 10 each
2017-10-01 17:50:02	Chiptheblewcat	oh.
2017-10-01 17:50:10	@Espyo	I've seen this countless times, people who come here to help, do contribute a tiny bit, and then leave
2017-10-01 17:50:20	@Espyo	it's very rare to see somebody who sticks around for more edits
2017-10-01 17:50:26	@Espyo	consider Vicky, for instance
2017-10-01 17:50:27	Chiptheblewcat	it still cuts stuff off your backburner..
2017-10-01 17:50:33	@Espyo	she helped with some images
2017-10-01 17:50:36	@Espyo	like 20 or something
2017-10-01 17:50:38	@Espyo	but has since stopped
2017-10-01 17:50:43	@Espyo	sure, there was that... incident
2017-10-01 17:50:47	@Espyo	but she was already starting to stop before that
2017-10-01 17:51:02	@Espyo	but I suppose it could only help to write an announcement

2017-10-08 12:52:55	@Espyo	good
2017-10-08 12:57:58	Yoshi2	another thing I need to figure out is how to make transparent textures
2017-10-08 12:58:11	Yoshi2	for some reason the ones imported from BMDs always have black around them
2017-10-08 13:02:09	@Espyo	hm, that sounds like one of those things that has an easy fix
2017-10-08 13:02:15	@Espyo	but chances are it's actually not
2017-10-08 13:02:44	Yoshi2	my first idea is converting the TGA textures to PNG
2017-10-08 13:03:15	Yoshi2	maybe the converter has trouble with TGA transparency
2017-10-08 13:09:58	@Espyo	yeah
2017-10-08 13:13:50	Yoshi2	works, ayyy https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291956181554167808/366558770597199882/unknown.png
2017-10-08 13:21:39	@Espyo	aww hell yeah
2017-10-08 13:21:43	@Espyo	well what do you know, it WAS easy

2017-11-04 14:58:13	@Espyo	so my cron job doesn't always run properly
2017-11-04 14:58:19	@Espyo	I just want to run a weekly backup script...
2017-11-04 14:58:28	@Espyo	this has been going on for like a year now
2017-11-04 14:58:32	@Espyo	anyway, today I was browsing Twitter
2017-11-04 14:58:35	@Espyo	and got this ad https://twitter.com/papertrailapp/status/890281868506968064
2017-11-04 14:58:43	@Espyo	and I just have so, SO many questions
2017-11-04 14:58:49	@Espyo	how did they know I had cron job problems?
2017-11-04 14:58:56	@Espyo	either the Almighty Google Knows All
2017-11-04 14:59:02	@Espyo	or that was a heck of a coincidence
2017-11-04 14:59:32	@Espyo	the command written on the tweet itself doesn't seem to make sense
2017-11-04 14:59:41	@Espyo	the ad itself is insane
2017-11-04 14:59:52	@Espyo	listen, if a cron job isn't running, chances are you butchered your command somewhere
2017-11-04 14:59:57	@Espyo	this isn't a MOVIE TRAILER
2017-11-04 15:00:09	@Espyo	and why in the world is this an entire SERVICE

2017-11-13 19:56:58	@J	so...I did an upgrade on my Raspberry Pi last night
2017-11-13 19:57:06	@J	it took until 1pm today
2017-11-13 19:57:52	@J	it was stuck generating locales for 18 hours
2017-11-13 19:58:00	@J	then somehow succeeded
2017-11-13 19:59:14	@Espyo	wow
2017-11-13 19:59:20	@Espyo	not even your standard Ubuntu takes that long
2017-11-13 19:59:43	@J	I ran the command to generate locales again afterwards and it took a few seconds
2017-11-13 20:00:01	@J	so I guess it just...had a sleep in the middle or something
2017-11-13 20:00:46	@J	in other news, I recently finished off a couple of games I've been neglecting
2017-11-13 20:01:00	@J	I played the 2nd chapter of Broken Age, and I finished Roundabout
2017-11-13 20:01:24	@J	one day I will learn to just stop playing adventure games
2017-11-13 20:04:16	@Espyo	hehe, mad man
2017-11-13 20:04:23	@Espyo	you have to play something lighter, like Mario Odyssey
2017-11-13 20:04:31	@Espyo	...unless you're going for the 100% completion
2017-11-13 20:06:44	@J	puzzle games and arcade action games all the way, I think
2017-11-13 20:06:51	@J	better yet, both together
2017-11-13 20:09:06	@J	oh, and funnily enough, I recently was working on getting cron to do proper notifications at work
2017-11-13 20:09:10	@J	after you mentioned it
2017-11-13 20:09:45	@J	it's really weird, apparently it just sends emails if there's output, not if the command fails
2017-11-13 20:14:17	@Espyo	if there's output?
2017-11-13 20:14:25	@Espyo	is this some weird cron limitation or something?
2017-11-13 20:14:43	@Espyo	(and an aside: my weekly backup cron job is still failing every once in a while and I cannot for the life of me understand why)
2017-11-13 20:14:51	@Espyo	(or maybe it's already working, since I haven't checked in months)
2017-11-13 20:15:18	@J	yeah, I think that's just how cron works
2017-11-13 20:16:05	@J	there's a tool called chronic you can wrap your commands in to make it behave correctly
2017-11-13 20:16:22	@J	although then it still doesn't send emails if it fails but outputs nothing
2017-11-13 20:21:10	@Espyo	eesh
2017-11-13 20:21:16	@Espyo	chronic, eh...
2017-11-13 20:21:20	@Espyo	I'll give it a try, thanks
2017-11-13 20:22:11	@Espyo	>Cronic is a shell script to help control the most annoying feature of cron: unwanted emailed output, or "cram" (cron spam).
2017-11-13 20:22:15	@Espyo	wait, let's dial it back a bit
2017-11-13 20:22:25	@Espyo	cron is meant to send you e-mails when a task is done?
2017-11-13 20:26:06	@J	yeah, it does it by default
2017-11-13 20:26:23	@J	but it mails to local users, I think using sendmail, if it's installed
2017-11-13 20:26:35	@Espyo	wait, is cron != crontab?
2017-11-13 20:26:38	@J	so it doesn't go anywhere unless you have forwarding set up
2017-11-13 20:26:44	@J	same thing
2017-11-13 20:26:55	@Espyo	how in the world does it know the e-mail addresses?
2017-11-13 20:27:08	@Espyo	how have I finished so many successful cron jobs without a single attempt at an e-mail?
2017-11-13 20:27:26	@J	well, if you don't have a 'sendmail' command, it does nothing
2017-11-13 20:27:27	@Espyo	who in the world decided that the system's basic task scheduler shouldn't be basic at all and should instead spit e-mails?
2017-11-13 20:27:46	@J	if you do, I think sendmail by default sticks it in a file in your home directory or something?
2017-11-13 20:27:59	@Espyo	ok, now it's starting to make a bit more sense
2017-11-13 20:28:17	@Espyo	that also explains the >/dev/null 2>&1 I've seen some people type in their jobs
2017-11-13 20:28:35	@Espyo	about the whole "e-mail only if there's output" thing
2017-11-13 20:29:08	@J	yeah
2017-11-13 21:56:59	Testyo	back all purples.

2017-11-14 19:20:23	@Espyo	oh, Claris
2017-11-14 19:20:33	@Espyo	we had another runner here, ages ago
2017-11-14 19:20:36	@Espyo	I can't remember who it was
2017-11-14 19:20:52	@Espyo	but I know that at one point I subscribed to them on Twitter, like I did you
2017-11-14 19:20:55	@Espyo	and see, here's the thing
2017-11-14 19:21:04	@Espyo	I remember that that runner posted a lot of A Hat in Time tweets
2017-11-14 19:21:19	@Espyo	and for the longest of time, I thought that they were actually DEVELOPING the game
2017-11-14 19:21:25	@Espyo	but now I'm starting to think those might've just been retweets
2017-11-14 19:21:34	@Espyo	anyway, it's all very hazy, and I was wondering if you could set it clear
2017-11-14 19:21:42	@J	it's a weird time to suddenly think that to yourself
2017-11-14 19:22:11	@Espyo	who is the runner? do they still sometimes show up here? did they ever post anything AHIT-related? are they a dev?
2017-11-14 19:22:17	@Espyo	eh, I thought about this the other day, really
2017-11-14 19:22:21	@Espyo	pretty much when AHIT launched
2017-11-14 19:22:32	@Espyo	until then, I looked at AHIT as a neat game that I didn't have particular interest in playing
2017-11-14 19:22:37	@J	I think I know who you mean
2017-11-14 19:22:46	@Espyo	it wasn't until its release some days ago that I realized that the game I had seen SO many tweets of... wasn't even released yet, at the time
2017-11-14 19:22:51	@J	is it the guy who first did 6-day Pikmin?
2017-11-14 19:22:57	@Espyo	might've been, yeah
2017-11-14 19:23:14	@Espyo	I'm still in contact with a lot of Pikmin runners on Pikcord, and a good few are still very active
2017-11-14 19:23:26	@Espyo	but I don't even remember the nickname so *shrug*
2017-11-14 19:23:35	@J	oh, TRR03 or something

2017-12-18 19:41:17	Guest5	So i was looking around at the general forum and it seemed pretty unactive since August is there a reason for that or does everyone hang out on the chat?

2017-12-18 19:47:16	Guest5	Thanks i guess once discord came into the picture i many smaller forums switched over which is kind of sad

2018-01-07 19:41:30	Lehari-Rocky	J
2018-01-07 19:41:50	@Espyo	so, since this is your return to the community in a while, how surprised are you about its activity?
2018-01-07 19:42:10	Lehari-Rocky	Remember me? Been about ten years. And yeah, it's surprising how big the discord is.
2018-01-07 19:42:40	@Espyo	it's so weird to look back
2018-01-07 19:42:48	@Espyo	Pikmin fans existed, but they weren't many, and were all over the place
2018-01-07 19:42:52	@Espyo	but now it's like a utopia
2018-01-07 19:42:53	@Espyo	I'm so happy
2018-01-07 19:43:10	Lehari-Rocky	I'm glad to see it built, and I hope to bring something wonderful to it.
2018-01-07 19:43:23	@Espyo	I'm sure you will, with that spirit
2018-01-07 19:43:39	@Espyo	I'd say it's the most active it's ever been, by far
2018-01-07 19:43:48	@Espyo	the hacking scene is going crazy lately, with new tools being created every month
2018-01-07 19:43:53	@Espyo	content creators are everywhere
2018-01-07 19:43:57	Lehari-Rocky	I'm actually glad to have caught you, specifically, given your talents.
2018-01-07 19:44:05	Lehari-Rocky	Since you have a mind for games.
2018-01-07 19:44:06	@Espyo	hehe
2018-01-07 19:44:12	@Espyo	don't know what drove me to like Pikmin so much
2018-01-07 19:44:14	@Espyo	but I'm glad I stood around
2018-01-07 19:44:26	@Espyo	it's a community I truly love
2018-01-07 19:44:42	Lehari-Rocky	I've loved the games and world even in my absence. 
2018-01-07 19:45:00	Lehari-Rocky	I just didn't know there was a community to go to until recently. 
2018-01-07 19:45:24	@Espyo	yeah, it feels like one of those niche franchises that either has a big community, or has no community other than a few stragglers
2018-01-07 19:45:31	@Espyo	tried Pikmin 3 yet? what about Hey! Pikmin?
2018-01-07 19:45:49	Lehari-Rocky	I've done P3, not Hey! Pikmin yet.
2018-01-07 19:46:14	@Espyo	it's a solid game for any Pikmin fan
2018-01-07 19:46:19	@Espyo	even if it's not a *great* game in and of itself
2018-01-07 19:46:57	Lehari-Rocky	Is there anything lore related I need to be aware of for my game?
2018-01-07 19:47:25	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2018-01-07 19:47:49	Lehari-Rocky	Any interesting precedent set by any new enemies or pikmin type?
2018-01-07 19:48:00	@Espyo	ah
2018-01-07 19:48:06	@Espyo	well, Hey! Pikmin is basically a soft reboot of Pikmin 1
2018-01-07 19:48:19	@Espyo	it's laid up to follow along the standard timeline
2018-01-07 19:48:31	@Espyo	but in terms of premise, it's similar to Pikmin 1
2018-01-07 19:48:36	@Espyo	as similar as you can get in a spin-off game
2018-01-07 19:48:36	Lehari-Rocky	Just from a 2d perspective?
2018-01-07 19:48:40	@Espyo	let me explain
2018-01-07 19:49:01	@Espyo	the story is about how Olimar landed in an alien planet, alone, and needs to find a way to fuel his ship to get back home
2018-01-07 19:49:08	@Espyo	that's... actually pretty much where the similarities end
2018-01-07 19:49:19	@Espyo	it's got the same Pikmin types as Pikmin 3, so nothing new
2018-01-07 19:49:23	@Espyo	but introduces a lot of new enemies to the franchise
2018-01-07 19:49:28	@Espyo	and mixes up some of the existing ones
2018-01-07 19:49:43	@Espyo	the Pikmin are all still the same and work the same, except with slightly tweaked abilities for new gameplay mechanics, like Reds stomping out fire
2018-01-07 19:49:58	@Espyo	the enemies are the biggest point of friction in regards to the lore
2018-01-07 19:50:15	@Espyo	a sort of Piklopedia returns, where you can see an enemy or treasure's model, and also get a quick description of it by Olimar
2018-01-07 19:50:23	@Espyo	and some of these descriptions... contradict what is said in the previous games
2018-01-07 19:50:41	@Espyo	but it's not like the series as a whole isn't familiar with contradictions
2018-01-07 19:50:46	@Espyo	so it passes off as nothing special, really
2018-01-07 19:50:51	Lehari-Rocky	... as the world's foremost Pikmin Biologist, I am upset at that idea.
2018-01-07 19:51:05	@Espyo	oh, there's a lot to be upset about when it comes to the biological nomenclature, for instance
2018-01-07 19:51:29	@Espyo	it's clear that they bothered to make a decent game, but they didn't bother to make it follow within the Pikmin world
2018-01-07 19:51:38	@Espyo	probably just discarded that effort as "who cares, this is a spin-off"
2018-01-07 19:51:43	@Espyo	and I can see that making sense, actually
2018-01-07 19:51:51	@Espyo	the inconsistencies don't bother me that much precisely because it's a spin-off
2018-01-07 19:52:06	@Espyo	I'd rather focus on the things it did right, and hope they work towards making a better Pikmin 4
2018-01-07 19:53:04	Lehari-Rocky	I'll take that. If there's something cool, I'll take it from HP, but if it's stupid, I won't.
2018-01-07 19:53:40	@Espyo	pretty much the best way to approach it
2018-01-07 19:53:47	@Espyo	some of the enemies are pretty lame ideas
2018-01-07 19:54:01	@Espyo	they look like they come directly from a fan with little imagination and a lot of recolor power
2018-01-07 19:54:22	@Espyo	but others are actually really smart, and work well not just for the side-scroller spin-off, but for the series as a whole, too
2018-01-07 19:54:41	Lehari-Rocky	I mean, palate swaps aren't something we can really avoid. We got those in canon.
2018-01-07 19:55:46	@Espyo	yeah
2018-01-07 19:57:01	Lehari-Rocky	Well, let me know if J responds, I'm headed back to Discord. Mobile is a bitch.
2018-01-07 19:57:34	@Espyo	will do

2018-03-03 19:03:56	Superkman23	Hi
2018-03-03 19:05:28	Superkman23	Esypo
2018-03-03 19:05:56	Superkman23	I was wondering how you make the assets for pikifen
2018-03-03 19:10:41	@Espyo	well, depends on the asset
2018-03-03 19:10:48	@Espyo	which were you thinking, the object sprites?
2018-03-03 19:11:48	Superkman23	I was planning on making new pikmin types
2018-03-03 19:12:02	@Espyo	right, for the Pikmin graphics, I drew them in Inkscape
2018-03-03 19:12:11	Superkman23	Ok. thanks!
2018-03-03 19:12:13	@Espyo	which deals with vectorial graphics, not the usual pixel graphics found in most image types
2018-03-03 19:12:25	@Espyo	you can use the SVGs in the source code to copy and create your own types, based on the existing ones
2018-03-03 19:12:38	@Espyo	https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/tree/master/Documents/Vectorial%20graphics
2018-03-03 19:13:13	Superkman23	Also I was wondering if It was possible to make bridges over bottomless pits yet
2018-03-03 19:13:23	@Espyo	ah, I think you showed up here some days go to ask that
2018-03-03 19:13:28	@Espyo	sorry, I wasn't around and you left before I could reply
2018-03-03 19:13:40	@Espyo	funny enough, I actually noticed that it's impossible to create that the day after I launched the latest update
2018-03-03 19:13:48	@Espyo	so I changed up some stuff for this update and made that possible
2018-03-03 19:14:02	Superkman23	cool!
2018-03-03 19:14:16	@Espyo	don't know when the next update will be done, but if I'm done with it after the script cleanup, then it should be released in like 2 weeks
2018-03-03 19:14:24	Superkman23	Yeah that was me a few days earlier
2018-03-03 19:14:26	@Espyo	but chances are I'll add more content before releasing it, so it'll still take a month or so
2018-03-03 19:14:28	@Espyo	right
2018-03-03 19:14:55	Superkman23	I'll try to get it as soon as it comes out! ;)
2018-03-03 19:15:11	@Espyo	hehe, sick
2018-03-03 19:15:35	@Espyo	I usually announce my releases on Twitter, the Pikmin fanon forum thread, and on Pikcord's #pikmin-fanon room
2018-03-03 19:15:39	Superkman23	Also, I made a video about the game
2018-03-03 19:15:46	@Espyo	oh? can I see?
2018-03-03 19:15:52	Superkman23	yeah
2018-03-03 19:15:59	Superkman23	i'll put in a link in a sec
2018-03-03 19:16:27	@Espyo	thanks
2018-03-03 19:16:30	Superkman23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=623WBkOiGBw&t=9s
2018-03-03 19:17:08	Superkman23	No problem
2018-03-03 19:20:31	Superkman23	I couldn't make the bridge at the bottom of the level so that's why i just had Louie walk off.
2018-03-03 19:37:32	@Espyo	oh, let's see here...
2018-03-03 19:38:42	@Espyo	seeing other people's areas makes me better understand what still needs to be done in the engine
2018-03-03 19:38:50	@Espyo	like plants — the area would look a lot better with plants
2018-03-03 19:38:55	@Espyo	so I'll try to make them a higher priority
2018-03-03 19:39:01	Superkman23	Definetly
2018-03-03 19:39:02	@Espyo	I've just started the video, but here are some tips:
2018-03-03 19:39:12	@Espyo	when the grass color changes tone, create a texture blending sector in-between
2018-03-03 19:39:15	@Espyo	it'll make the transition look better
2018-03-03 19:39:17	Superkman23	ok
2018-03-03 19:39:20	@Espyo	and don't be afraid to use non-straight angles
2018-03-03 19:39:27	@Espyo	the area looks a bit angular, which isn't very common in real-life
2018-03-03 19:39:32	@Espyo	you know, using 90 degree angles on walls
2018-03-03 19:39:32	Testyo	90 degree = 1.5708 rad
2018-03-03 19:39:49	Superkman23	ok
2018-03-03 19:40:25	@Espyo	oh, nice use of the lying down ability! I keep forgetting it exists
2018-03-03 19:40:31	@Espyo	I'm thinking of adding Go Here! some day
2018-03-03 19:40:39	Superkman23	that would be neat
2018-03-03 19:43:56	Superkman23	You should add male sherrgrubs, You could make ambushes with them
2018-03-03 19:48:29	@Espyo	I haven't added them because they're a more-or-less easy type to create based on the existing Female
2018-03-03 19:48:39	@Espyo	much like how you made the Orange Bulborb there
2018-03-03 19:48:55	@Espyo	I could include them for the sake of completion, but I want to focus on what I can do for the engine, since other people can create content themselves
2018-03-03 19:49:09	Superkman23	Thanks, I downloaded a mod just because i can't draw
2018-03-03 19:49:32	Superkman23	I just had to make it work with 0.13
2018-03-03 19:50:49	Superkman23	same with anything that's not in the main game
2018-03-03 19:51:51	Superkman23	idk why i said thanks
2018-03-03 19:52:55	@Espyo	lol
2018-03-03 19:53:02	@Espyo	ah, I see
2018-03-03 19:53:16	@Espyo	hey, I've noticed that when you let your whistle blow for the maximum duration, there's some static on the left speaker
2018-03-03 19:53:18	@Espyo	does that always happen?
2018-03-03 19:53:40	Superkman23	I didn't hear it untill i re watched the video
2018-03-03 20:01:34	Superkman23	Actually, I get a split second of static when i hold the wistle out
2018-03-03 20:01:47	Superkman23	*Whistle
2018-03-03 20:04:11	@Espyo	darn, that's weird...
2018-03-03 20:04:21	@Espyo	but thanks for letting me know! I'll try to find a fix for it
2018-03-03 20:04:31	Superkman23	My speakers aren't the best anyway
2018-03-03 20:04:49	Superkman23	I wish you good luck
2018-03-03 20:05:20	@Espyo	thanks!
2018-03-03 20:05:49	Superkman23	No problem! (I use this too much in reply to thanks)
2018-03-03 20:06:48	Superkman23	I saw how you were going to add punching into the game
2018-03-03 20:15:46	Superkman23	If you want to try out the level here's link to download it. I edited a bit as we were talking: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E1dpRheJFoM06d8aIa1S_7C2XkRIQLSv
2018-03-03 20:21:45	@Espyo	oh, thanks!
2018-03-03 20:21:51	@Espyo	and yeah, punching is already in
2018-03-03 20:22:10	Superkman23	How does it work?
2018-03-03 20:22:30	Superkman23	I I mean obviousally it hurts enemys
2018-03-03 20:28:19	@Espyo	heh
2018-03-03 20:28:22	@Espyo	it works like in Pikmin 1
2018-03-03 20:28:26	@Espyo	so just one punch at a time
2018-03-03 20:28:35	@Espyo	I don't know if I'll add support for multiple punches like the Rocket Fist in Pikmin 2, yet
2018-03-03 20:29:13	Superkman23	What button?

2018-03-03 20:35:22	@Espyo	also, I asked somebody else who ran the engine on windows, and they don't get the weird crackling noise at the end of a whistle...

2018-03-03 20:36:12	@Espyo	well, I'll try to keep an eye out (an ear out?) to see (hear?) if it happens again
2018-03-03 20:36:18	@Espyo	if it does, I'll try to figure something out to fix it
2018-03-03 20:36:24	Superkman23	Ok
2018-03-03 20:36:30	Superkman23	Nice jokes. lol
2018-03-03 20:38:08	Superkman23	Also,i don't have the punching animation in the spritesheet
2018-03-03 20:40:12	Superkman23	And i couldn't find it in the controls
2018-03-03 20:43:26	@Espyo	sorry, I mean that it's already in... the next version's code
2018-03-03 20:43:35	@Espyo	I should've made it clearer
2018-03-03 20:43:40	Superkman23	Oh. That makes sense
2018-03-03 20:43:54	Superkman23	It's fine
2018-03-03 20:45:40	Superkman23	Almost seems like you could release version 0.13.1 now! Not much but it would be a great update! (Totally not trying to get new content today!) 
2018-03-03 20:46:50	@Espyo	haha
2018-03-03 20:47:08	Superkman23	Totally. heh heh
2018-03-03 20:49:03	Superkman23	Some ideas I have are makng enemys drop pellets (With a tag) and add pellet posys. The first idea could help with the second one.
2018-03-03 20:49:54	@Espyo	trust me, I would be fine with the idea of smaller, more frequent updates, but the problem is creating them takes so much
2018-03-03 20:50:00	@Espyo	making the features and bugfixes, that's fine, that's just normal work
2018-03-03 20:50:26	Superkman23	I understand
2018-03-03 20:50:27	@Espyo	but to create a version, I need to unpack my old laptop, wait for it to slowly boot, fetch all of the changes I made, set up the environment, and slowly compile the next version
2018-03-03 20:50:42	Superkman23	oh
2018-03-03 20:50:45	@Espyo	not to mention the smaller tasks, like having to increase the version number every time
2018-03-03 20:50:52	@Espyo	honestly, this would be much better if my old laptop wasn't so slow
2018-03-03 20:50:57	@Espyo	but I have to use it, since I use Linux on this one
2018-03-03 20:51:04	@Espyo	and I can't create a version for windows users on it
2018-03-03 20:51:21	@Espyo	anyway, yeah, I have pellet dropping planned!
2018-03-03 20:51:30	Superkman23	If i could find out how, maybe you can send me the files and i could compile them!
2018-03-03 20:51:37	@Espyo	I'm working on improving the scripting right now, and object dropping is definitely a part of it
2018-03-03 20:51:37	Superkman23	Just an idea
2018-03-03 20:51:57	@Espyo	pellet posies will take a while though, but I want to make them for the next update, so here's hoping
2018-03-03 20:52:05	Superkman23	ok
2018-03-03 20:52:18	@Espyo	well, the project IS open source... if you know how to compile C++ projects with visual studio, you could do it
2018-03-03 20:52:23	@Espyo	but if not, it's a lot more of a hassle than not
2018-03-03 20:53:22	Superkman23	I havent really done that... Maybe if i learned then i could help
2018-03-03 20:54:13	@Espyo	I'm afraid it's not really something you learn overnight...
2018-03-03 20:54:19	@Espyo	thanks for the help though
2018-03-03 20:54:24	Superkman23	Makes sense
2018-03-03 20:54:39	Superkman23	Does it have to be in visual studio?
2018-03-03 20:54:44	Superkman23	just asking
2018-03-03 20:54:55	@Espyo	well, to play the game, you can compile it with anything that can compile C++ code, really
2018-03-03 20:55:02	@Espyo	like, on Linux, I don't use visual studio
2018-03-03 20:55:14	@Espyo	but to create an .exe that other people can play, I do need visual studio
2018-03-03 20:55:15	Superkman23	oh ok
2018-03-03 20:55:18	@Espyo	I haven't figured out any other way
2018-03-03 20:55:34	@Espyo	at least big updates have one good thing: players get a lot of new content all at once!
2018-03-03 20:55:45	@Espyo	and they don't have to spend so much time downloading versions all the time and applying them
2018-03-03 20:55:57	Superkman23	Yeah
2018-03-03 20:55:57	@Espyo	especially because most versions require that players change some of their content to support the more recent versions
2018-03-03 20:56:21	Superkman23	Which I suck at and hate
2018-03-03 20:56:44	@Espyo	hehe, I'm sorry
2018-03-03 20:56:55	@Espyo	some of the format changes are important so that new features can be supported
2018-03-03 20:57:02	@Espyo	others exist so that the files are just cleaner in general
2018-03-03 20:57:06	@Espyo	I don't like having to make these changes
2018-03-03 20:57:15	@Espyo	but it's worth it to make it so that working with the engine is actually intuitive
2018-03-03 20:57:15	Superkman23	That explains a lot
2018-03-03 20:57:43	@Espyo	one change was so big I even had to create a tool that helped people port their content
2018-03-03 20:57:47	@Espyo	version 0.8, I think?
2018-03-03 20:57:54	Superkman23	Yeah
2018-03-03 20:57:56	Superkman23	i think
2018-03-03 21:02:59	Superkman23	I guess because i want to make games someday, i better start learning now!

2018-03-03 21:13:38	@Espyo	yeah, it's great to be interested in game development
2018-03-03 21:13:48	@Espyo	just tinker around with whatever games or mods you can find, and have fun
2018-03-03 21:14:05	@Espyo	eventually you'll start picking up on common practices, popular types of files, and the ways games work
2018-03-03 21:14:26	Superkman23	yeah
2018-03-03 21:14:39	Superkman23	all i can do is block codind. :(
2018-03-03 21:14:50	Superkman23	coding
2018-03-03 21:15:22	@Espyo	block coding?
2018-03-03 21:15:43	Superkman23	yeah, where you drag blocks onto a screen
2018-03-03 21:15:51	@Espyo	ah, right
2018-03-03 21:15:53	@Espyo	that's not so bad
2018-03-03 21:15:54	Superkman23	look up scratch
2018-03-03 21:16:02	Superkman23	i made an rpg
2018-03-03 21:16:06	@Espyo	yeah, I've heard of it
2018-03-03 21:16:11	@Espyo	there's no problem with that
2018-03-03 21:16:22	@Espyo	in fact, I was gonna suggest if if you weren't doing that already
2018-03-03 21:16:31	Superkman23	It's a good start i think
2018-03-03 21:16:35	@Espyo	it's a great way to learn how things work, without having to melt your brain trying to memorize code
2018-03-03 21:16:43	Superkman23	I love impressing my class with it
2018-03-03 21:16:45	@Espyo	coding with a programming language can get very difficult sometimes...
2018-03-03 21:16:51	@Espyo	hehe, that's great!
2018-03-03 21:17:28	Superkman23	https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/183889426/ its a link to my rpg
2018-03-03 21:17:56	Superkman23	only reason i dislike it it because i need to download a player to play it offline
2018-03-03 21:18:11	@Espyo	hm, that doesn't sound very fun, no
2018-03-03 21:18:18	@Espyo	but hey, it's better than not even letting you play offline in the first place
2018-03-03 21:18:36	Superkman23	yeah
2018-03-03 21:21:19	Superkman23	best part is i can just duplicate some stuff to make new enemies and slightly alter their stats and give them new looks
2018-03-03 21:21:45	@Espyo	yeah
2018-03-03 21:23:22	Superkman23	sorta like how i duplicated the red bulborb to make to orange bulborb
2018-03-03 21:25:02	@Espyo	right
2018-03-03 21:26:52	Superkman23	One question i got was how do i make the bulborb wake up sooner if i am in front of him than if i am behindhim
2018-03-03 21:29:25	@Espyo	well, that's controlled by the "reaches"
2018-03-03 21:29:38	@Espyo	if you go to the Bulborb's Data.txt file
2018-03-03 21:29:52	@Espyo	there's a block with data about the "reaches"
2018-03-03 21:30:01	@Espyo	one of them should be the "reach" the Bulborb uses to wake up
2018-03-03 21:30:11	@Espyo	you basically define two pieslices in there
2018-03-03 21:30:50	@Espyo	it's tough to explain, but there's the tutorial on the wiki
2018-03-03 21:30:58	Superkman23	ok
2018-03-03 21:31:23	@Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_fangame_engine/Object_script#Script-related_parameters
2018-03-03 21:32:36	Superkman23	thanks
2018-03-03 21:41:14	Superkman23	That helped. now the orange bulborb moves slightly faster, and wakes up sooner if you're at the front
2018-03-03 21:41:42	Superkman23	But the front range is smaller
2018-03-03 21:42:47	Superkman23	Also i found your secret debug commands
2018-03-03 21:47:44	Superkman23	I think you should make it impossible to grab entitys if they are behind a blocking terrain unless it's been destroyed (like a wall) or if a height difference is 50+

2018-03-03 22:07:11	@Espyo	I'm afraid that checking if there's a wall in the way is probably a performance penalty I'm not sure I want to deal with
2018-03-03 22:07:22	@Espyo	but the tip about checking if the height difference is over 50 is actually pretty good!
2018-03-03 22:07:27	@Espyo	can't believe I didn't think of it
2018-03-03 22:12:11	Superkman23	Because i just ended up throwing pikmin through gates and up 1000+ units! 
2018-03-03 22:13:57	Superkman23	I think I know how to use Visual Studio. But I still can't make the hello world project
2018-03-03 22:18:22	Superkman23	Actually, I still suck
2018-03-03 22:33:11	Superkman23	Can you still send me the code and i can test aroynd and stuff?
