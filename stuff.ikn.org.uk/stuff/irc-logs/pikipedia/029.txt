2016-05-25 21:39:32	@Espyo	at least, from what I gather from pop culture
2016-05-25 21:39:55	Scruffy	So you get one big main course and a *lot* of side dishes, all in little bowls, that you all share
2016-05-25 21:40:09	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-25 21:40:10	@Espyo	I can imagine it
2016-05-25 21:40:24	Scruffy	My favorite of them and the most popular one is kimchee, pickled spiced cabbage leaves
2016-05-25 21:40:35	@Espyo	that's so specific
2016-05-25 21:40:44	Scruffy	Might not sound initially appetizing, but the spiciness is perfect
2016-05-25 21:41:44	Scruffy	it's also customary that guests and hosts exchange gifts on the first meeting
2016-05-25 21:41:51	Scruffy	As a sign of respect
2016-05-25 21:42:45	Scruffy	but of course the expected behavior is to act surprised and feel too humble to accept
2016-05-25 21:43:31	Yoshi2	what gifts did you bring?
2016-05-25 21:44:00	Scruffy	Purses, we stayed with the aunts of my friend
2016-05-25 21:44:23	Scruffy	Since it's a long journey to see them, we figured to bring something nice
2016-05-25 21:46:10	Scruffy	oh, also, every conceivable space is taken up by local shops, restaurants, or taekwondo schools
2016-05-25 21:46:25	Scruffy	It's very crowded, but efficiently organized
2016-05-25 21:47:44	Scruffy	I have to go for now, but it's great to be back!
2016-05-25 21:47:55	@Espyo	great to have you back
2016-05-25 21:47:57	@Espyo	see you later
2016-05-25 21:48:00	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-05-25 21:48:03	Scruffy	See ya!

2016-05-25 21:48:39	Marty2000	Hello
2016-05-25 21:48:45	@Espyo	oh, UnknownPikmin, you never answered me last time
2016-05-25 21:48:48	@Espyo	but that softlock glitch
2016-05-25 21:48:48	Marty2000	See you <scruffy
2016-05-25 21:48:52	@Espyo	can you explain it in more detail?
2016-05-25 21:49:02	@Espyo	like, you said that nobody was able to reproduce it

2016-05-25 21:49:11	@Espyo	so are you telling me the glitch never happened to nobody, ever?
2016-05-25 21:49:21	UnknownPikmin	no.
2016-05-25 21:49:44	UnknownPikmin	The glitch was discovered, but it only happened once.
2016-05-25 21:49:52	@Espyo	to you?
2016-05-25 21:49:59	UnknownPikmin	Yes.
2016-05-25 21:50:05	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-25 21:50:10	@Espyo	were you using any cheating devices at the time?
2016-05-25 21:50:19	UnknownPikmin	no.
2016-05-25 21:50:34	UnknownPikmin	I got the glitch without cheats
2016-05-25 21:50:37	@Espyo	hm, how did you get the counter to exceed 999, though?
2016-05-25 21:50:47	@Espyo	I remember several years ago, trying to get the highest score, and I could only reach like 600 something
2016-05-25 21:51:10	UnknownPikmin	pellet posy/enemy hunting.
2016-05-25 21:51:19	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-25 21:51:27	@Espyo	I did try on The Impact Site
2016-05-25 21:51:31	@Espyo	I guess other areas might be better
2016-05-25 21:51:55	@Espyo	so, by "makes all your Pikmin disappear", do you mean it just sets your Pikmin counter to 0 for every type?
2016-05-25 21:52:00	UnknownPikmin	I had to wait 1 whole hour for the day to end
2016-05-25 21:52:05	UnknownPikmin	and yes.
2016-05-25 21:52:18	@Espyo	did this happen at the start of a new day, or while playing?
2016-05-25 21:52:38	@Espyo	sorry to act like the Inquisition here, but I really want more info about this bug
2016-05-25 21:52:52	@Espyo	because having a bug on the wiki saying "at one point, Pikmin vanished" isn't going to be very useful for anybody that reads it
2016-05-25 21:52:57	UnknownPikmin	it happened mid-day
2016-05-25 21:53:01	@Espyo	so we should try to gather as much info as possible
2016-05-25 21:53:11	@Espyo	did it happen after you delivered enough Pikmin for the counter to go past 999?
2016-05-25 21:53:19	UnknownPikmin	yes.
2016-05-25 21:53:24	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-25 21:53:40	@Espyo	did this happen on The Distant Spring?
2016-05-25 21:53:52	@Espyo	I'm thinking the counter glitch may have had its play on this too
2016-05-25 21:53:55	UnknownPikmin	Yes.
2016-05-25 21:53:58	@Espyo	aha
2016-05-25 21:54:10	@Espyo	also, you said you had to wait 1 hour for the day to end
2016-05-25 21:54:15	@Espyo	does that mean the game kept going, but incredibly slowly?
2016-05-25 21:54:23	UnknownPikmin	Lots of lag.
2016-05-25 21:54:28	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-25 21:54:37	@Espyo	not really the same as a softlock then; that name needs to be changed later
2016-05-25 21:54:47	@Espyo	what happened at the end of the day? did the counters return to normal?
2016-05-25 21:55:21	UnknownPikmin	the game crash and well, a softlock occured
2016-05-25 21:55:32	@Espyo	the game crashed where?
2016-05-25 21:55:39	@Espyo	at the "Today's Report" screen?
2016-05-25 21:55:43	@Espyo	after asking you to save?
2016-05-25 21:55:52	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-05-25 21:56:14	Marty2000	Good night Yoshi2
2016-05-25 21:56:23	UnknownPikmin	when the Day Over cut scene ended.
2016-05-25 21:57:03	UnknownPikmin	and i had to wipe my file
2016-05-25 21:57:14	@Espyo	how come?
2016-05-25 21:57:20	@Espyo	did the game save the corrupted "0" Pikmin?
2016-05-25 21:57:41	UnknownPikmin	because it corrupted my entire file and the counter
2016-05-25 21:57:55	@Espyo	but that's so weird
2016-05-25 21:58:06	@Espyo	you're telling me the game crashed after the lift-off cutscene
2016-05-25 21:58:12	@Espyo	but that's before the game even saves to the memory card
2016-05-25 21:58:19	@Espyo	so it should've kept the memory card intact and unharmed
2016-05-25 21:59:12	UnknownPikmin	well, it did save at the end, so it really happened when it saved
2016-05-25 21:59:20	@Espyo	that I can imagine
2016-05-25 21:59:23	@Espyo	but why did it save?
2016-05-25 21:59:25	@Espyo	it had no reason to
2016-05-25 21:59:52	@Espyo	well, you told me it was never reproduced, but why not?
2016-05-25 21:59:57	UnknownPikmin	when it tried to start my file again, it was unusable
2016-05-25 21:59:57	@Espyo	did other people reach 999 and nothing happened
2016-05-25 22:00:05	@Espyo	or did you just not try again, since it takes forever to get 999?
2016-05-25 22:00:23	UnknownPikmin	and yes, the glitch only happened to me
2016-05-25 22:01:06	Marty2000	I could try to reproduce it with Dolphin, if help is needed
2016-05-25 22:01:07	UnknownPikmin	and my only choices were to use another file or delete the corrupted one
2016-05-25 22:01:51	@Espyo	right, but did you try to get the glitch to happen again?
2016-05-25 22:02:01	@Espyo	Marty2000: yeah, I was thinking of using Dolphin to reproduce it, if possible
2016-05-25 22:02:46	@Espyo	also, on what version of the game was this? the GameCube original, or the Wii remake with Wii Remote controls?
2016-05-25 22:02:48	Marty2000	So, I have 999 blue Pikmin now, I guess I have to bring pellet and corpses to the Blue Onion
2016-05-25 22:02:55	@Espyo	oh, that was quick
2016-05-25 22:02:56	@Espyo	yeah, guess so...
2016-05-25 22:04:59	@Espyo	meanwhile, I can't figure out exactly how the game does the lists
2016-05-25 22:05:03	@Espyo	it might be like I said, with two lists
2016-05-25 22:05:12	@Espyo	but honestly, there are a lot of ways to store data like this
2016-05-25 22:05:15	@Espyo	so it could be anything
2016-05-25 22:05:20	@Espyo	but at least it's VERY clear that the game reuses slots
2016-05-25 22:05:33	@Espyo	well, since I won't include lists or anything in the explanation, I might just use the glitches article after all
2016-05-25 22:05:39	UnknownPikmin	I didn't, but I think it MIGHT happen in Pikmin 2 and 3, but it has a higher chance of producing in Pikmin 3
2016-05-25 22:05:56	UnknownPikmin	Also this is important
2016-05-25 22:06:02	@Espyo	hm, you didn't? you didn't what?
2016-05-25 22:06:11	@Espyo	you didn't try again?
2016-05-25 22:07:16	UnknownPikmin	But the No-Pikmin Softlock Glitch...
2016-05-25 22:07:23	UnknownPikmin	isn't real.
2016-05-25 22:07:32	@Espyo	explain
2016-05-25 22:07:38	UnknownPikmin	April Fools!
2016-05-25 22:08:26	UnknownPikmin	But really, that's the truth.
2016-05-25 22:08:39	@Espyo	you're a few months late
2016-05-25 22:08:58	UltraMario	wat
2016-05-25 22:09:05	Marty2000	No problem, I'm using Dolphin to find the max Pikmin cap in P1
2016-05-25 22:09:11	@Espyo	heh, nice
2016-05-25 22:09:59	UnknownPikmin	Marty2000, Espyo, I hope you find a real No-Pikmin Softlock Glitch.
2016-05-25 22:10:07	@Espyo	eh, maybe one day
2016-05-25 22:10:43	UnknownPikmin	also this next one is a bit fake
2016-05-25 22:11:18	UnknownPikmin	But maybe there could be a "Spazzing Pikmin Glitch"?
2016-05-25 22:11:30	@Espyo	well, either way
2016-05-25 22:11:34	@Espyo	feel free to discuss fake glitches all you want
2016-05-25 22:11:39	@Espyo	but don't add them to the wiki, all right?

2016-05-25 22:14:25	@Espyo	to add a new glitch
2016-05-25 22:14:28	@Espyo	so I could've removed it then
2016-05-25 22:14:29	@Espyo	no worries
2016-05-25 22:14:55	UnknownPikmin	wut was the new glitch all about?
2016-05-25 22:15:40	@Espyo	it's a bit of a long story
2016-05-25 22:15:47	@Espyo	but basically, Onions spit out seeds that have buds or flowers
2016-05-25 22:16:01	UnknownPikmin	:/
2016-05-25 22:16:44	UnknownPikmin	So you say that Onions can spit out pre-evolved Pikmin?
2016-05-25 22:16:55	@Espyo	yeah, except
2016-05-25 22:16:59	@Espyo	the Pikmin that comes out is still leaf
2016-05-25 22:17:02	@Espyo	so it doesn't affect gameplay
2016-05-25 22:17:13	@Espyo	it's only the little bulb you see coming out that has a bud or flower
2016-05-25 22:17:17	UnknownPikmin	Strange...
2016-05-25 22:17:18	Marty2000	Yes, it's juts aesthetic
2016-05-25 22:17:27	Marty2000	just*
2016-05-25 22:17:41	UnknownPikmin	The Plasm Wraith is kinda tough
2016-05-25 22:18:06	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-25 22:18:17	Marty2000	I'd love to eat the fruits that we can find in Pikmin 3.
2016-05-25 22:18:35	UnknownPikmin	Although, one question.
2016-05-25 22:18:56	UnknownPikmin	How long does it take for Pikmin to drown?
2016-05-25 22:19:59	Marty2000	Hmm... I heard it depends on the version of the game for Pikmin (the first)
2016-05-25 22:20:15	Marty2000	I don't have precise times, though
2016-05-25 22:20:17	UnknownPikmin	In Pikmin 3?
2016-05-25 22:20:21	Marty2000	I'd say it takes roughly 10 seconds
2016-05-25 22:20:31	Marty2000	For the three games
2016-05-25 22:20:39	Marty2000	But it's not very precise
2016-05-25 22:21:02	Marty2000	I will try to get better times later if I can
2016-05-25 22:21:13	UnknownPikmin	What's a Sunset Warning?
2016-05-25 22:21:43	Marty2000	It's the message that shows up when the day is close to finishing
2016-05-25 22:21:58	Marty2000	to ending*
2016-05-25 22:22:41	UnknownPikmin	In Pikmin 3 it shows up when the sun is two dots away from the right side
2016-05-25 22:23:24	UnknownPikmin	Stray Pikmin will not survive.
2016-05-25 22:23:25	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-25 22:23:31	Marty2000	Unfortunately :/
2016-05-25 22:24:14	UnknownPikmin	Remember when I talked about Pikmin Extinctions?
2016-05-25 22:24:47	Marty2000	Hmm?
2016-05-25 22:24:56	Marty2000	I'm not sure... sory
2016-05-25 22:24:59	Marty2000	sorry*
2016-05-25 22:25:02	Marty2000	What was it?
2016-05-25 22:25:12	UnknownPikmin	Maybe a Pikmin extinction could be caused by sunset
2016-05-25 22:25:29	UnknownPikmin	by leaving all your pikmin stray
2016-05-25 22:25:49	Marty2000	It is possible
2016-05-25 22:26:05	Marty2000	You'll have a new seed ejected by the Onions the next day ;)

2016-05-25 22:34:19	@Espyo	not sure if this should go under Did you know, though
2016-05-25 22:34:26	@Espyo	hm, but I guess it can still be tweeted about, actually
2016-05-25 22:34:30	Marty2000	Now that I think of it, Espyo... since the glitch about the seeds in somewhat similar to that with the leader, I think we could mention it here http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cave#Oddities "A similar glitch happens in P1 with Pikmin seeds"
2016-05-25 22:34:42	@Espyo	eh, I don't know...
2016-05-25 22:34:52	@Espyo	the only similarity is in the way it uses an old value left in memory
2016-05-25 22:34:54	Marty2000	Oh, I'll check what you've just written
2016-05-25 22:35:03	@Espyo	other than that, nothing about the glitches match
2016-05-25 22:35:12	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 22:35:19	@Espyo	I guess we still can
2016-05-25 22:35:27	@Espyo	let me see if it looks good having a mention
2016-05-25 22:37:57	Marty2000	I think we could just add "Notes: This glitch doesn't work if the Pikmin evolved by drinking nectar."
2016-05-25 22:38:08	Marty2000	Otherwise, that's a great and clear explanation :)

2016-05-25 22:39:41	Marty2000	Welcome back, UnknownPikmin
2016-05-25 22:40:16	@Espyo	I'm not sure I follow the nectar thing, though
2016-05-25 22:40:26	@Espyo	the values only get set if you pluck a Pikmin
2016-05-25 22:40:30	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-25 22:40:37	@Espyo	so if a Pikmin evolves via nectar... well, it's not a buried Pikmin
2016-05-25 22:40:39	Marty2000	That's why I'm saying that nectar has no effect
2016-05-25 22:40:40	@Espyo	so you can't pluck it
2016-05-25 22:40:54	@Espyo	yeah, but that's like saying holding down the R button has no effect :|
2016-05-25 22:41:10	@Espyo	the evolution itself has no effect on the glitch, and I hope the reader gets that by themselves
2016-05-25 22:41:19	@Espyo	all that matters is the maturity of the seed at the time of pluckign
2016-05-25 22:41:20	@Espyo	*plucking
2016-05-25 22:41:24	@Espyo	so nectar could never be involved
2016-05-25 22:41:28	@Espyo	I think it's obvious

2016-05-25 22:41:39	@Espyo	unless I'm missing something...
2016-05-25 22:41:41	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-05-25 22:41:57	@Espyo	ok, I also wrote down the addresses I got
2016-05-25 22:41:57	Marty2000	Then, if it seems obvious to everybody, no need to mention it
2016-05-25 22:42:01	@Espyo	who knows, they could be useful in the future
2016-05-25 22:42:03	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-25 22:42:16	Marty2000	Cool!

2016-05-25 22:47:14	Marty2000	It makes me wonder if a similar glitch could exist in P3... I can't think of any situation involving that, though...
2016-05-25 22:47:25	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-25 22:47:33	@Espyo	it's impossible to think of it until you see it happen
2016-05-25 22:47:40	@Espyo	if it were, it wouldn't slip into the final product
2016-05-25 22:47:54	Marty2000	Yeah, true

2016-05-25 22:49:30	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User:UnknownPikmin by UnknownPikmin (+160 N Created page with "Hello Wiki User, i am an unknown Pikmin species. I am usually...) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=21407&diff=165498
2016-05-25 22:49:50	@Espyo	...I must be blind
2016-05-25 22:49:50	Marty2000	Just to make sure, I'll try in P3, I don't think I've done so yet
2016-05-25 22:50:04	@Espyo	I can't find what box to use to post something on facebook
2016-05-25 22:50:09	@Espyo	and I've made a lot of posts on the Pikipedia page before
2016-05-25 22:50:17	Marty2000	Sorry to hear that :/ That's strange...
2016-05-25 22:50:24	UnknownPikmin	So, does anyone know how much health the Plasm Wraith has?
2016-05-25 22:50:46	Marty2000	[[Plasm Wraith]]
2016-05-25 22:50:47	Testyo	"Plasm_Wraith" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Plasm_Wraith
2016-05-25 22:51:12	Marty2000	Normally it's 320, but the plasm adds more health
2016-05-25 22:51:22	UnknownPikmin	I have a challenge.
2016-05-25 22:51:32	Marty2000	Espyo told me something like that, if I remember
2016-05-25 22:51:54	UnknownPikmin	Testyo, thanks
2016-05-25 22:51:54	Marty2000	I had asked him because I was surprised
2016-05-25 22:51:54	Testyo	What would you guys recomend of those things that needs overthinking...
2016-05-25 22:52:18	@Espyo	I just guessed that it must have a lot more health, since 320 is pretty weak
2016-05-25 22:52:25	@Espyo	and that extra health is probably in the regeneration mechanic
2016-05-25 22:52:36	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-25 22:52:57	UnknownPikmin	Testyo, how do I defeat the final boss
2016-05-25 22:52:57	Testyo	okay, I'm going to have to seriously consider using multiple plates at meal times
2016-05-25 22:53:21	UnknownPikmin	Hi, Testyo.
2016-05-25 22:53:21	Testyo	since it'd be at the collab, I wouldn't even know of her death
2016-05-25 22:53:34	@Espyo	what in the world...
2016-05-25 22:53:34	Marty2000	Who is testyo
2016-05-25 22:53:35	Testyo	I am Espyo's bot! For more info, type Testyo help.
2016-05-25 22:53:43	@Espyo	I managed to find a way to post

2016-05-25 22:53:55	Marty2000	Can't you find the box at all?
2016-05-25 22:53:55	@Espyo	instead of using the front page, as usual, I had to go to a really obscure menu somewhere that allowed me to post
2016-05-25 22:53:57	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-25 22:53:58	@Espyo	because the box was missing
2016-05-25 22:54:00	UnknownPikmin	Testyo help
2016-05-25 22:54:00	Testyo	Help file: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47921869/Permanent/Testyo/Help.html Ask Espyo for more info!
2016-05-25 22:54:01	@Espyo	but AFTER I posted
2016-05-25 22:54:03	@Espyo	the box returned...
2016-05-25 22:54:04	Marty2000	How strange...
2016-05-25 22:54:09	@Espyo	ugh, facebook is so poorly made...
2016-05-25 22:54:13	@Espyo	glitches like this are all over the place
2016-05-25 22:54:24	Marty2000	He he... I don't use it often too
2016-05-25 22:54:30	Marty2000	Only to communicate with far family
2016-05-25 22:54:37	Marty2000	And to see Pikipedia's page :p
2016-05-25 22:54:46	@Espyo	same, I only use it to talk to friends
2016-05-25 22:54:47	@Espyo	heh, and Pikipedia
2016-05-25 22:54:57	@Espyo	I scroll through it real quick at lunch, but it's normally just junk
2016-05-25 22:55:14	@Espyo	still, both the web version and the mobile app are so badly made...
2016-05-25 22:55:27	@Espyo	I'm seriously considering finding something else to browse through while I have lunch
2016-05-25 22:55:28	Marty2000	Oh yes, usually it's only """"""strange"""""" things
2016-05-25 22:55:40	Marty2000	(stupid, to be honest)
2016-05-25 22:55:52	Marty2000	But it's nly my opinion, so no offense for those who like it here
2016-05-25 22:56:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-25 22:56:45	Marty2000	It's so long to have buried Pikmin evolve in P3...
2016-05-25 22:56:54	Marty2000	Compared to the two other games
2016-05-25 22:57:03	@Espyo	I guess it makes sense
2016-05-25 22:57:12	@Espyo	you have to work a lot harder to get flower Pikmin (without using sprays...)
2016-05-25 22:57:17	@Espyo	but once you do have them, you keep them forever
2016-05-25 22:57:29	Marty2000	Yes, you're right
2016-05-25 22:57:30	@Espyo	in the classics, going up and down in maturity is just a normal thing, and happens a lot
2016-05-25 22:57:36	@Espyo	honestly, I don't know which of the two ways is better
2016-05-25 22:57:41	@Espyo	they're just different, in my opinion
2016-05-25 22:57:45	@Espyo	neither is better than the other
2016-05-25 22:58:01	Marty2000	I prefer P1 system for a personnal reason... I prefer bud Pikmin :p
2016-05-25 22:58:08	UnknownPikmin	Testyo
2016-05-25 22:58:09	Testyo	hm, all right, it can extract szs, but can it extract the debugging
2016-05-25 22:58:14	Marty2000	But P3 might be a better system, especially for beginners
2016-05-25 22:58:16	@Espyo	they both have a strategic element to it (in the classics, fighting a withering enemy is a risk, in Pikmin 3, there's strategy in using your resources and time to invest on flowers)
2016-05-25 22:58:25	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-25 22:58:26	@Espyo	yeah, that's for sure
2016-05-25 22:58:28	UnknownPikmin	Testyo Russian roulette
2016-05-25 22:58:28	Testyo	Ladies and gentlemen, UnknownPikmin loaded a 6-chambered revolver with 1 bullet. Type Testyo fire to give it a shot!
2016-05-25 22:58:30	@Espyo	the beginner thing
2016-05-25 22:59:17	UnknownPikmin	Who wants to do Russian Roulette?
2016-05-25 22:59:24	Marty2000	Ok, the glitch doesn't work in P3
2016-05-25 22:59:31	@Espyo	I'm too focused on other things right now, sorry
2016-05-25 22:59:34	Marty2000	Let's go for one if you want too
2016-05-25 22:59:36	Marty2000	to*
2016-05-25 22:59:52	UnknownPikmin	Type Testyo fire to try your luck
2016-05-25 22:59:52	Testyo	news sections/pages are historically really badly maintained on Pikipedia, so good luck with that will be a problem for me then
2016-05-25 23:00:03	Marty2000	Testyo fire
2016-05-25 23:00:03	Testyo	Click. No bullet, Marty2000. (1 bullet remaining; 6 chambers)

2016-05-25 23:02:10	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-25 23:02:14	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-05-25 23:02:24	Marty2000	Seems to exist in P3 too
2016-05-25 23:02:41	Marty2000	But only on certain places
2016-05-25 23:02:51	Marty2000	I could find one on the Garden of Hope...
2016-05-25 23:02:54	Marty2000	Let me record that
2016-05-25 23:03:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-25 23:03:32	UnknownPikmin	Testyo cah <UnknownPikmin, Espyo, Marty2000>

2016-05-25 23:05:41	Testyo	why are wollywogs named wollyhops in special chambers

2016-05-25 23:06:46	Testyo	Game over! The following people were shot: Marty2000, Espyo.
2016-05-25 23:06:54	UnknownPikmin	yay
2016-05-25 23:07:30	Marty2000	Probably know it, Espyo, but Rock and Purple Pikmin can be thrown slightly further in P3
2016-05-25 23:07:36	Marty2000	(than other types)
2016-05-25 23:07:55	@Espyo	I didn't
2016-05-25 23:08:01	@Espyo	well, the Rocks just tumble forward after they land
2016-05-25 23:08:04	@Espyo	so it makes sense
2016-05-25 23:08:05	@Espyo	(right?)
2016-05-25 23:08:12	Marty2000	YEs
2016-05-25 23:08:15	UnknownPikmin	Testyo cah UnknownPikmin Espyo Marty2000

2016-05-25 23:08:16	Testyo	Question: What'll I bring back in time to convince people that I'm a wizard?
2016-05-25 23:08:39	@Espyo	sorry UnknownPikmin, but I don't feel like playing cah
2016-05-25 23:08:47	@Espyo	and the game can't continue with two people 
2016-05-25 23:08:53	@Espyo	try it on like a weekend, when there are more people around
2016-05-25 23:09:06	UnknownPikmin	Testyo 1
2016-05-25 23:09:06	Testyo	always tried searching for that red text on the second screenshot
2016-05-25 23:10:00	UnknownPikmin	Testyo serious
2016-05-25 23:10:00	Testyo	Only Espyo can tell me to enter serious mode!
2016-05-25 23:10:12	UnknownPikmin	Espyo?
2016-05-25 23:10:42	UnknownPikmin	Hey, Espyo?
2016-05-25 23:10:54	@Espyo	hm?
2016-05-25 23:11:20	UnknownPikmin	Can you make Testyo activate serious mode?
2016-05-25 23:11:20	Testyo	I could do it, them going berserk and thinking I'm a slacker
2016-05-25 23:11:25	@Espyo	what for?
2016-05-25 23:11:36	UnknownPikmin	I want to see what it is
2016-05-25 23:12:20	UnknownPikmin	plz?
2016-05-25 23:12:21	@Espyo	well, it's what it says on the manual
2016-05-25 23:12:30	@Espyo	he loses access to games and "fun" stuff
2016-05-25 23:12:32	@Espyo	that's all it is
2016-05-25 23:12:52	UnknownPikmin	Do it, please.
2016-05-25 23:13:07	@Espyo	I won't do it if I don't need to
2016-05-25 23:16:10	UnknownPikmin	Testyo create poll
2016-05-25 23:16:11	Testyo	Ok, we're going to create a poll in private! You can write this command again to cancel.
2016-05-25 23:17:16	Marty2000	Rock Pikmin seeds are original... and I've just noticed that Winged Pikmin do notset foot on ground when plcuked, that's funny too
2016-05-25 23:17:33	@Espyo	hmm

2016-05-26 03:27:00	En_Passant	Something like that
2016-05-26 03:27:23	En_Passant	The difference between high school and college is much bigger than middle school to high school
2016-05-26 03:27:29	@PikFan	right
2016-05-26 03:27:35	En_Passant	Plus, if you have APs, you're basically finishing early

2016-05-26 03:27:48	En_Passant	... Earlier than the early seniors already get out

2016-05-26 04:41:56	@PikFan	how was your trip?
2016-05-26 04:42:17	Scruffy	Great. I absorbed a lot of new culture and climbed a lot of landmarks
2016-05-26 04:42:31	Scruffy	Really the whole place is climbing, it's so hilly
2016-05-26 04:42:44	Scruffy	And I got to try a lot of new food, especially sea creatures
2016-05-26 04:43:01	@PikFan	I hope you didn't eat any... squid *gulp*
2016-05-26 04:43:17	@PikFan	(course, I'm kidding. I say so because of Splatoon)

2016-05-26 04:43:53	@PikFan	but yeah, that's pretty awesome that you got to see all that
2016-05-26 04:44:00	Scruffy	But sea cucumber, scallop, stingray, sea snail, whelk, flounder, and abalone I tried for the first time
2016-05-26 04:44:01	@PikFan	how many places did you go?
2016-05-26 04:44:03	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 04:44:08	@PikFan	wow, that's a lot
2016-05-26 04:44:36	Scruffy	I stayed mainly in Busan, but also visited Seoul (South Korea's biggest city) and Jeju Island (Korea's Hawaii
2016-05-26 04:45:11	Scruffy	My favorite experience was hiking up Mount Hallasan in Jeju
2016-05-26 04:45:12	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-26 04:45:27	Scruffy	It's the largest mountain in Korea, and a dormant volcano that created the whole island
2016-05-26 04:45:28	@PikFan	how about the language? did you learn any Korean?
2016-05-26 04:45:32	@PikFan	wow
2016-05-26 04:45:45	Scruffy	A little bit, but my keyboard doesn't support the text
2016-05-26 04:46:04	Scruffy	anyway annyeonghaseyo means hello
2016-05-26 04:46:29	Scruffy	kansahamnida means thank you
2016-05-26 04:47:10	Scruffy	and jal mokkeseumnida is a phrase of respect to the preparer of a meal
2016-05-26 04:47:22	Scruffy	And a few other phrases
2016-05-26 04:47:29	Scruffy	Not very much, but enough to get by

2016-05-26 04:50:38	@PikFan	no, I was talking about Japan

2016-05-26 04:50:46	Scruffy	oh, yes
2016-05-26 04:51:04	Scruffy	I responded "That's the spirit," Japan sounds like a really cool place
2016-05-26 04:51:15	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-26 04:51:35	@PikFan	South Korea also seems like an interesting place
2016-05-26 04:52:07	Scruffy	Yeah, it has its own little quirks from other southeastern asian countries
2016-05-26 04:52:15	Scruffy	Such as metal chopsticks, for example
2016-05-26 04:52:31	@PikFan	hmm, metal chopsticks
2016-05-26 04:52:31	Scruffy	They're cleaner and absorb less bacteria, but they can be slippery at times
2016-05-26 04:52:39	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-26 04:53:09	Scruffy	You have to be advanced at wooden chopsticks to get them right
2016-05-26 04:53:43	@PikFan	wow
2016-05-26 04:53:49	@PikFan	I bet it took some practice
2016-05-26 04:53:58	Scruffy	Yeah, but eventually I got it
2016-05-26 04:54:10	Scruffy	Meals there are interesting; it's all about self-service
2016-05-26 04:54:32	Scruffy	Waiters just hand you all the food on the table, and then everyone shares it
2016-05-26 04:54:49	@PikFan	huh
2016-05-26 04:54:53	Scruffy	Usually it's one big steaming bowl of main course and then lots of little bowls of side dishes
2016-05-26 04:54:59	@PikFan	mhm
2016-05-26 04:55:13	@PikFan	read as "one big steaming bowl of rice"
2016-05-26 04:55:28	Scruffy	Side dishes like daigon radishes or kimchee, which is pickled spiced cabbage
2016-05-26 04:55:29	Scruffy	Heh
2016-05-26 04:55:49	@PikFan	woah, pickled spiced cabbage, that sounds inventive
2016-05-26 04:55:56	Scruffy	It is, and delicious
2016-05-26 04:56:12	Scruffy	But you'll find all sorts of vegetables that are treated this way
2016-05-26 04:56:23	Scruffy	Korean taste is sweet and spicy
2016-05-26 04:56:35	Scruffy	But especially spicy
2016-05-26 04:56:47	@PikFan	my taste buds are far too uncultured to appreciate foreign food :P
2016-05-26 04:56:52	Scruffy	Heh

2016-05-26 04:57:20	Scruffy	I tried kimchee here before going
2016-05-26 04:57:24	@PikFan	but yeah, that sounds interesting
2016-05-26 04:57:28	@PikFan	oh, nice
2016-05-26 04:57:47	Scruffy	Also their desserts are great, ice cream abounds
2016-05-26 04:58:04	Scruffy	In flavors I had never seen like green tea, red bean, and chestnut
2016-05-26 04:58:11	Scruffy	All very good
2016-05-26 04:58:13	@PikFan	neat
2016-05-26 04:58:31	@PikFan	you've heard of tempura, yeah?
2016-05-26 04:58:40	@PikFan	in Japan, they make ice cream tempura
2016-05-26 04:58:48	Scruffy	Heh, that's interesting
2016-05-26 04:58:49	@PikFan	I...don't know how that could work
2016-05-26 04:59:04	@PikFan	but yeah, seems the Asians love their ice cream as much as we do
2016-05-26 04:59:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 04:59:19	@PikFan	*-their
2016-05-26 04:59:20	Scruffy	Probably the biggest change from America was the driving
2016-05-26 04:59:30	@PikFan	oh, do they drive on the left?
2016-05-26 04:59:31	Scruffy	I didn't drive there, but I rode public transportation
2016-05-26 04:59:41	Scruffy	No, they're on the right
2016-05-26 04:59:45	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-26 04:59:54	Scruffy	But roads are so hilly, and cramped
2016-05-26 05:00:03	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-26 05:00:10	Scruffy	And everyone drives /so/ fast
2016-05-26 05:00:25	Scruffy	At every turn it felt either like a roller coaster or an imminent accident
2016-05-26 05:00:26	@PikFan	how fast are we talking?
2016-05-26 05:00:31	@PikFan	oh fun
2016-05-26 05:00:47	Scruffy	50 mph in a packed city area
2016-05-26 05:00:58	@PikFan	dang
2016-05-26 05:01:01	Scruffy	70-90 mph in a regular road
2016-05-26 05:01:07	@PikFan	dang
2016-05-26 05:01:09	Scruffy	Maybe I'm exaggerating with 90
2016-05-26 05:01:17	Scruffy	it was all in km
2016-05-26 05:01:23	@PikFan	right, right
2016-05-26 05:01:25	Scruffy	but still, 50 mph on a bus
2016-05-26 05:01:32	Scruffy	it's quite a change
2016-05-26 05:01:42	@PikFan	at that point I'd rather ride a train, or something
2016-05-26 05:01:51	Scruffy	plus my home town here is entirely flat, no elevation to speak of
2016-05-26 05:01:55	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:02:02	Scruffy	But it was a lot of fun
2016-05-26 05:02:07	@PikFan	but... I guess they're used to it
2016-05-26 05:02:14	@PikFan	so it SHOULD be safe
2016-05-26 05:02:14	Scruffy	And yes, they are used to it
2016-05-26 05:02:20	Scruffy	They drive very smartly
2016-05-26 05:02:37	@PikFan	I bet they have better driving education than here
2016-05-26 05:02:43	Scruffy	Most likely
2016-05-26 05:03:22	Scruffy	They also have a lot of taekwondo schools
2016-05-26 05:03:33	@PikFan	nice
2016-05-26 05:03:34	Scruffy	If I had stayed longer I would have liked to try it
2016-05-26 05:03:40	Scruffy	Along with Buddhism
2016-05-26 05:03:50	@PikFan	martial arts in general are quite impressive
2016-05-26 05:03:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:03:58	@PikFan	Buddhism, nice
2016-05-26 05:04:12	@PikFan	how much of an influence is Buddhism on their culture?
2016-05-26 05:04:15	Scruffy	I tried karate in grade school, but homework stopped me at an orange belt
2016-05-26 05:04:22	@PikFan	hehe
2016-05-26 05:04:37	Scruffy	There are a lot of temples, but Christianity also holds a lot of influence
2016-05-26 05:04:48	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-26 05:05:04	Scruffy	But we did visit a temple and I did bow to the Buddha there
2016-05-26 05:05:19	Scruffy	If we had more time it would have been nice to stay at a temple overnight, they allow that
2016-05-26 05:05:39	Scruffy	But we had a lot to see
2016-05-26 05:05:45	Scruffy	And mosquitoes to avoid
2016-05-26 05:06:18	@PikFan	mosquitoes, fun
2016-05-26 05:06:29	@PikFan	if there's mosquitoes, is it hot and humid there already?
2016-05-26 05:06:30	Scruffy	It wasn't as bad as I thought
2016-05-26 05:06:36	Scruffy	It's getting there
2016-05-26 05:06:44	Scruffy	But the water was still too cold to swim in
2016-05-26 05:06:50	@PikFan	oh lol
2016-05-26 05:07:11	Scruffy	But the beaches were beautiful
2016-05-26 05:07:26	Scruffy	Especially on Jeju, covered with volcanic rock that had eroded into smooth shapes
2016-05-26 05:07:31	Scruffy	Perfect for stacking
2016-05-26 05:07:41	@PikFan	man, I'm almost jealous now
2016-05-26 05:07:43	Scruffy	Our record is 22, I think
2016-05-26 05:07:50	Scruffy	Heh
2016-05-26 05:07:55	@PikFan	best beach I went to was in California
2016-05-26 05:08:04	@PikFan	but that was when I was 6 so I don't remember much
2016-05-26 05:08:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:08:22	@PikFan	I'd love to visit a picturesque tropical beach...
2016-05-26 05:08:25	Scruffy	Any beach seems to beat the American southeast Coast
2016-05-26 05:08:40	Scruffy	Where it's mainly eroded and the water is filled with silt
2016-05-26 05:08:59	Scruffy	Except the Florida keys, they're pretty nice
2016-05-26 05:09:10	@PikFan	or the Northwest Coast, where it's always raining, windy, and cloudy
2016-05-26 05:09:16	@PikFan	and eroded beaches too
2016-05-26 05:09:30	Scruffy	But the water in Jeju was like a postcard, it was blue-green and you could actually see the bottom underneath it
2016-05-26 05:09:47	@PikFan	it sounds gorgeous
2016-05-26 05:09:52	Scruffy	And there were plenty of waterfalls, which were new to me
2016-05-26 05:10:29	Scruffy	And actually, on this subject of natural beauty...
2016-05-26 05:10:48	@PikFan	wow...
2016-05-26 05:10:51	Scruffy	taking all the photos of new plants inspired me
2016-05-26 05:11:01	@PikFan	did you get pictures?
2016-05-26 05:11:06	Scruffy	A lot
2016-05-26 05:11:12	@PikFan	oh, good
2016-05-26 05:11:38	Scruffy	Yeah, as okay as my memory is, pictures are sort of a necessity
2016-05-26 05:11:38	@PikFan	anyway, inspiration? is it... Pikmin related?
2016-05-26 05:11:43	Scruffy	Yes
2016-05-26 05:11:48	@PikFan	ooooooh
2016-05-26 05:12:01	Scruffy	I was working in Blender with plants, trying to create them and make them look realistic
2016-05-26 05:12:06	Scruffy	And I got further inspired 
2016-05-26 05:12:13	Scruffy	I'm going to make a Pikmin short movie
2016-05-26 05:12:18	Scruffy	Like, a full-length one
2016-05-26 05:12:25	@PikFan	hold up
2016-05-26 05:12:36	@PikFan	I thought your computer can't handle it?
2016-05-26 05:12:43	Scruffy	I'll find a way
2016-05-26 05:12:49	@PikFan	well, go for it
2016-05-26 05:12:49	Scruffy	It's too much fun to work on
2016-05-26 05:12:52	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-26 05:13:00	Scruffy	Maybe I could use my college's computer lab or something
2016-05-26 05:13:10	Scruffy	But I've already started modeling for it
2016-05-26 05:13:14	@PikFan	by full-length, do you mean like the length of the actual Short Movies?
2016-05-26 05:13:18	Scruffy	Yes
2016-05-26 05:13:24	@PikFan	...incredible
2016-05-26 05:13:43	@PikFan	you're going to have to use all your patience on that
2016-05-26 05:13:53	Scruffy	It depends on the length of the story I'm telling, but I'm thinking it'll be at least 5 minutes
2016-05-26 05:13:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:14:06	Scruffy	I've got the story already though
2016-05-26 05:14:18	@PikFan	yeah, that's good
2016-05-26 05:14:22	@PikFan	basic structure is helpful
2016-05-26 05:14:27	Scruffy	All I want to say for now is that it's about a Purple Pikmin who wants to go a little bit faster
2016-05-26 05:14:36	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-05-26 05:14:44	@PikFan	I can already see things going wrong
2016-05-26 05:14:51	Scruffy	Heh
2016-05-26 05:15:06	Scruffy	But I've got it modeled, along with a few other things
2016-05-26 05:15:10	@PikFan	nice
2016-05-26 05:15:19	Scruffy	And rigged, with new tricks I learned from tutorials
2016-05-26 05:15:36	Scruffy	I can do a lot more with this model than I could with my older Pikmin posable model
2016-05-26 05:15:44	@PikFan	if only there was another person with your skill in our community, then the two of you could collaborate...
2016-05-26 05:15:52	Scruffy	heh, yeah
2016-05-26 05:15:57	@PikFan	oh, that's good
2016-05-26 05:16:01	@PikFan	like, how much more?
2016-05-26 05:16:03	Scruffy	I mean you guys all have a lot of skill
2016-05-26 05:16:07	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2016-05-26 05:17:04	Scruffy	I can change eye and pupil shape now, the hairs on the Purple Pikmin simulate hair physics in real-time, and the stem has more constraints to it so that I can move one switch to animate the entire thing
2016-05-26 05:18:44	<--	En_Passant (Mibbit@34-20-33-09.hlrn.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-05-26 05:18:57	Scruffy	I guess the other stuff I'll reveal is that I'm working in the canon realm of the Pikmin Short Movies, which means only Pikmin from Pikmin 2, and trying to use mainly things that appear in all three games
2016-05-26 05:19:26	@PikFan	well, I dunno what to say other than that I approve of it
2016-05-26 05:19:32	Scruffy	There's a few exceptions to that latter rule in this film, but that's okay
2016-05-26 05:19:35	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-05-26 05:19:59	@PikFan	I think it's been almost a year since you updated Pikipedia's music articles, no?
2016-05-26 05:20:11	Scruffy	I'm putting aside Night Mode for a bit to work on this over the summer, because I've completed some models so far and it's just so satisfying
2016-05-26 05:20:13	Scruffy	Almost
2016-05-26 05:20:32	@PikFan	Night Mode...
2016-05-26 05:20:37	Scruffy	Actually tomorrow
2016-05-26 05:20:43	@PikFan	oh wow
2016-05-26 05:20:50	@PikFan	did you check?
2016-05-26 05:20:53	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:21:04	Scruffy	27 May 2015, at 1:44 PM
2016-05-26 05:21:33	Scruffy	It feels like it's been more than a year though
2016-05-26 05:21:36	Scruffy	So much stuff goes on
2016-05-26 05:21:55	@PikFan	I haven't quite reached that point yet
2016-05-26 05:21:57	-->	Miles_ (Miles@070-566-528-76.res.bhn.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-26 05:22:31	Scruffy	You haven't been on Pikipedia for a year?
2016-05-26 05:22:38	Scruffy	I thought you were here a long time
2016-05-26 05:23:35	<--	Miles (Miles@070-566-528-76.res.bhn.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2016-05-26 05:23:49	@PikFan	I mean, I haven't reached that point in my life where a year of real time feels longer than a year
2016-05-26 05:23:55	Scruffy	Oh
2016-05-26 05:24:08	Scruffy	I just meant on here
2016-05-26 05:24:15	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-26 05:24:18	Scruffy	In real life it still feels like a year
2016-05-26 05:24:19	Scruffy	heh
2016-05-26 05:24:39	Scruffy	Anyway, that's my big news
2016-05-26 05:24:56	@PikFan	busy as always, I see
2016-05-26 05:25:00	Scruffy	Creating it from scratch is going to be a challenge, but I'm up for it since it's going to smootly
2016-05-26 05:25:05	Scruffy	so*
2016-05-26 05:25:23	@PikFan	reaching for ever-larger horizons
2016-05-26 05:25:37	Scruffy	Yeah...
2016-05-26 05:25:56	Scruffy	I'm just worried some obstacle will come up that prevents me from continuing
2016-05-26 05:26:01	@PikFan	I admire your dedication
2016-05-26 05:26:05	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-05-26 05:26:26	@PikFan	well, take it slow and steady
2016-05-26 05:26:26	Scruffy	I couldn't have even begun without everyone's help here
2016-05-26 05:26:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:26:43	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-05-26 05:26:47	Scruffy	I've got a workflow document this time, so it'll all be little goals
2016-05-26 05:26:57	@PikFan	I think you're giving yourself too little credit
2016-05-26 05:27:08	Scruffy	And I'm going to storyboard the whole thing, so I can render each little scene
2016-05-26 05:27:16	@PikFan	organization, yay
2016-05-26 05:28:03	Scruffy	But I wish I could spoil the story to someone so they could help edit it if it needs work
2016-05-26 05:28:15	Scruffy	I would ask your help, but I don't want to spoil it for you
2016-05-26 05:28:55	@PikFan	hahahahah
2016-05-26 05:29:10	@PikFan	well, just go for it
2016-05-26 05:29:25	@PikFan	I kinda actually want to review the final thing
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	the final film?
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	sure, it'd be fun to guide you along
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	yeah, the final film
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	so... you do want to hear it then?
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	but at the same time, I want to be immersed in the whole thing
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	no, no
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Heh okay
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	I want it to be like going to see a new movie for the first time
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Cool, great
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	I'm taking a different approach with my review style this time around
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	I think I have a good story to tell so far, so I don't imagine it'll be too much trouble
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Oh?
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	in that I'm not peer-editing it, but just going to actually review it when it comes out
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	how's Louie's story going?
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Alright, haven't worked on it too much for the past month
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	But it's also kind of on hold while this film project is going
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	I wonder why :P
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	mm, makes sense
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	oh, yeah!
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	This takes precedence, it's just sooo much fun
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	I had some news for you
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Oh/
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	?
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	so...I'm gonna learn how to program!
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Awesome!
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	What language?
2016-05-26 05:33:40	@PikFan	C++
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Neat!
2016-05-26 05:33:40	Scruffy	Sounds great!
2016-05-26 05:33:43	@PikFan	it's all because of my friend
2016-05-26 05:33:54	@PikFan	she loves the Zelda series to death
2016-05-26 05:34:04	Scruffy	who wouldn't
2016-05-26 05:34:09	@PikFan	so she wants to create an actual Zelda fangame
2016-05-26 05:34:17	@PikFan	kinda like Espyo with his fangame engine
2016-05-26 05:34:20	Scruffy	Right
2016-05-26 05:34:25	@PikFan	but, she has no experience with programming
2016-05-26 05:34:44	@PikFan	so we decided to learn programming together
2016-05-26 05:34:54	@PikFan	that way, I can help her with stuff
2016-05-26 05:35:01	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-05-26 05:35:10	Scruffy	You're a good friend
2016-05-26 05:35:14	@PikFan	it's also better to have 2 people working on a project like that, I think
2016-05-26 05:35:17	@PikFan	heh, thanks
2016-05-26 05:35:23	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:35:42	@PikFan	learning programming seems daunting...
2016-05-26 05:35:44	Scruffy	That way it's easier to help one another if something difficult to understand comes up
2016-05-26 05:35:52	@PikFan	but with the support of programmers in this community, I think we'll be fine
2016-05-26 05:35:57	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-26 05:36:08	@PikFan	Espyo writes the fangame engine in C++, right?
2016-05-26 05:36:15	Scruffy	Uhh, I think
2016-05-26 05:36:27	@PikFan	heh, okay
2016-05-26 05:36:32	@PikFan	well, I'll just ask him myself
2016-05-26 05:36:41	Scruffy	That's good, I have no clue
2016-05-26 05:36:43	@PikFan	I tried asking Yoshi2 earlier but he wasn't sure either
2016-05-26 05:37:06	Scruffy	Just finished my Red Pikmin model
2016-05-26 05:37:16	@PikFan	yay
2016-05-26 05:37:34	Scruffy	I should be sleeping, but I'm in jetlag mode
2016-05-26 05:37:45	Scruffy	it would be 1:37 PM for me in South Korea
2016-05-26 05:38:37	@PikFan	lovely
2016-05-26 05:38:53	@PikFan	the computer will lock me out in 10 minutes, just a heads up
2016-05-26 05:38:59	Scruffy	Ah okay
2016-05-26 05:39:10	Scruffy	I wanted to talk to you about Mysterious World
2016-05-26 05:39:17	Scruffy	Firstly I'm sorry you had to cancel it
2016-05-26 05:39:44	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-26 05:39:51	Scruffy	It's clear you had a lot of creativity put into it
2016-05-26 05:39:53	@PikFan	well, I got too obsessed over reviews
2016-05-26 05:40:07	@PikFan	that was my story's downfall
2016-05-26 05:40:16	Scruffy	Did it get bad reviews?
2016-05-26 05:40:24	@PikFan	not really
2016-05-26 05:40:36	@PikFan	I mean, I was getting too obsessed over people reading it
2016-05-26 05:40:53	@PikFan	on the website I had it on, fanfiction.net, there was a new story that came up
2016-05-26 05:41:05	@PikFan	within a week, it had already updated, and got 4 reviews
2016-05-26 05:41:22	@PikFan	jealousy and envy took over
2016-05-26 05:41:37	@PikFan	so I was just being really immature
2016-05-26 05:42:22	Scruffy	Aww man, I'm sorry
2016-05-26 05:42:39	@PikFan	eh, it's whatever, I think I'll just stay away from that whole business for a while
2016-05-26 05:42:47	@PikFan	my story wasn't all that original anyway
2016-05-26 05:43:03	@PikFan	I mean, it's a fan-written piece, of course it won't be original
2016-05-26 05:43:28	@PikFan	but the point of fanfiction is to BE original
2016-05-26 05:43:41	@PikFan	and... the themes I was using weren't all that original
2016-05-26 05:43:56	@PikFan	there were just a lot of things wrong
2016-05-26 05:44:02	Scruffy	That's okay, it's the experience that's important
2016-05-26 05:44:13	@PikFan	my writing style can still use a major improvement
2016-05-26 05:44:36	Scruffy	That you feel that way is germane to your stories
2016-05-26 05:45:04	Scruffy	My 10th-grade creative writing teacher put it very bluntly: "Murder your darlings."
2016-05-26 05:45:18	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-26 05:45:37	@PikFan	well, just little things here and there can really improve the flow of my writing, as Yoshi2 helped me to realize
2016-05-26 05:45:57	Scruffy	like what?
2016-05-26 05:46:06	@PikFan	well, he read the prolouge
2016-05-26 05:46:10	@PikFan	*prologue
2016-05-26 05:46:18	@PikFan	pointed out lots of little things
2016-05-26 05:46:34	@PikFan	not that I'm deriding him for it; I appreciate it
2016-05-26 05:46:39	Scruffy	Right
2016-05-26 05:46:50	@PikFan	I just...
2016-05-26 05:46:53	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2016-05-26 05:46:58	@PikFan	anyway, sorry, I gotta go
2016-05-26 05:47:04	Scruffy	no problem
2016-05-26 05:47:06	@PikFan	the computer will lock me out in a minute
2016-05-26 05:47:08	Scruffy	hang in there
2016-05-26 05:47:18	@PikFan	I'll be on around noon tomorrow your time, if you're on then
2016-05-26 05:47:30	@PikFan	thanks
2016-05-26 05:47:30	Scruffy	your writing is really good, and has great potential at any moment
2016-05-26 05:47:41	Scruffy	i don't know if i'll be on

2016-05-26 12:16:24	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-05-26 12:16:25	Testyo	like inspired in something mentioned in some sort of the game/franchise is also fine
2016-05-26 12:17:51	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-26 12:19:12	Yoshi2	oh joy, I am now owner of neocraft's channel because his nick was dropped
2016-05-26 12:19:28	@Espyo	pfft
2016-05-26 12:19:30	@Espyo	oh, speaking of
2016-05-26 12:19:44	@Espyo	yesterday, on another network, ChanServ suddenly told me I was founder of a #PokeWorld channel
2016-05-26 12:19:46	@Espyo	...which was empty
2016-05-26 12:19:55	@Espyo	really confused the hell out of me
2016-05-26 12:20:23	Yoshi2	pokeworld isn't registered at the moment o.ô
2016-05-26 12:20:31	@Espyo	no, not here
2016-05-26 12:20:33	@Espyo	on another network
2016-05-26 12:20:34	Yoshi2	oh
2016-05-26 12:20:38	@Espyo	but regardless yeah, it also wasn't registered
2016-05-26 12:20:59	@Espyo	so is today International ChanServ Weirdness day, or...?
2016-05-26 12:21:32	Yoshi2	well, in my case I was set as the successor to neocraft by himself
2016-05-26 12:21:43	@Espyo	right
2016-05-26 12:21:44	Yoshi2	so when his nick rip'd naturally I became the founder
2016-05-26 12:23:43	Yoshi2	it's a bummer that neo doesn't even come online so often anymore, so I can't yell at him very easily
2016-05-26 12:24:48	@Espyo	heh, yeah

2016-05-26 12:30:49	Yoshi2	and finally take care of that tcrf tank issue
2016-05-26 12:36:25	@Espyo	ye

2016-05-26 12:40:03	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khl83qWRzls&feature=youtu.be heh
2016-05-26 12:46:43	Yoshi2	is that youtube's stabilizer at work?
2016-05-26 12:47:54	Yoshi2	oh god why
2016-05-26 12:50:07	@Espyo	I didn't notice
2016-05-26 12:50:11	@Espyo	I played on VLC
2016-05-26 12:50:14	@Espyo	wonder if that bypasses it
2016-05-26 13:05:00	Yoshi2	Espyo: how's this for a post on the talk page: https://imgur.com/ni45dWO
2016-05-26 13:05:12	Yoshi2	the images I'm referring to: https://imgur.com/a/apoTN
2016-05-26 13:06:18	@Espyo	seems good
2016-05-26 13:09:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: should I make a summary for this too? Probably something like "Add explanation on why it is "Panther" and not "Panzer""
2016-05-26 13:09:42	Yoshi2	or should I make it more neutral
2016-05-26 13:10:15	@Espyo	neutral
2016-05-26 13:10:59	Yoshi2	"Elaboration on what tank the toy tank represents"
2016-05-26 13:13:29	Yoshi2	that doesn't feel entirely right though
2016-05-26 13:13:47	@Espyo	you don't have to add a summary
2016-05-26 13:15:42	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-05-26 13:16:11	Yoshi2	considering how often people get away with not adding a summary, I guess I can afford to do that in this case considering people can just read through the text
2016-05-26 13:16:54	Yoshi2	yup, people rarely add summaries to the talk page https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Talk:Pikmin_2&action=history
2016-05-26 13:17:04	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-26 13:17:19	@Espyo	summaries are good for when you see the list of changes, and see a "fixed a typo"
2016-05-26 13:17:25	@Espyo	that way you know you don't need to check it, it's just a typo
2016-05-26 13:17:32	@Espyo	but if you see a -1 edit that has no explanation
2016-05-26 13:17:37	@Espyo	it could be an important change
2016-05-26 13:17:51	@Espyo	you won't know till you click
2016-05-26 13:17:54	@Espyo	but for talk pages?
2016-05-26 13:18:01	@Espyo	 9 times out of 10, a talk page edit is either a new topic, or a reply

2016-05-26 13:24:35	@Espyo	<eientei95> Espyo: Oh boy
2016-05-26 13:24:39	@Espyo	he can be so volatile sometimes
2016-05-26 13:24:45	@Espyo	but I told him to read the talk page instead of bitching
2016-05-26 13:25:54	@Espyo	<eientei95> The point here is, yes, Panzer was a line of tanks, it could be one of the other Panzer tanks used during WWII rather than the one Panzer model 3 "Panther"
2016-05-26 13:27:08	Yoshi2	did he even get to the part of my message where I talked about how the model is fairly specific
2016-05-26 13:27:51	@Espyo	<eientei95> Upon further investigation, it is the Panzer III
2016-05-26 13:28:01	Yoshi2	..........................................
2016-05-26 13:28:06	@Espyo	<Shiz> Panther was Panzer model 5, not 3
2016-05-26 13:28:17	@Espyo	you guys should probably talk this out on IRC

2016-05-26 14:46:11	Yoshi2	I avoided being salty about that this time, but I do have my share of salt too
2016-05-26 14:48:25	@Espyo	'course
2016-05-26 14:48:46	Yoshi2	which I might unleash when somebody says it is bad that I am pedantic about this
2016-05-26 14:52:33	Yoshi2	my next idea is that I will add comparison screenshots with the toy tank model on the left and a real tank on the right
2016-05-26 14:53:53	@Espyo	this is bringing me back
2016-05-26 14:54:04	@Espyo	back on the Carmageddon Wiki days, comparing what vehicles matched what real-life cars
2016-05-26 14:54:11	@Espyo	and different people having vastly different opinions
2016-05-26 14:54:33	@Espyo	and me just sitting here like "I'm like the middleman in all of this, and yet the only thing I know about cars is that you drive on them"
2016-05-26 14:54:54	Yoshi2	heh
2016-05-26 14:55:26	Yoshi2	but as soon as you are similary passionate about armored vehicles, you're a military otaku or something like that
2016-05-26 14:55:41	@Espyo	heh, yep
2016-05-26 14:56:12	Yoshi2	maybe I will try to import the model in a proper modelling program
2016-05-26 14:56:16	Yoshi2	with proper shading
2016-05-26 14:56:26	Yoshi2	because the complete lack of shading on the model is not helping my case
2016-05-26 14:56:34	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-26 14:56:38	@Espyo	BMDView2 has a way to export the model
2016-05-26 14:56:43	@Espyo	so just open that up with whatever
2016-05-26 15:13:02	Yoshi2	there was some talk of just saying "German WW2 tank", but the model is specific enough and I think this is pretty interesting trivia
2016-05-26 15:13:21	Yoshi2	nintendo could've made a generic tank model, but instead they made something pretty specific
2016-05-26 15:13:45	@Espyo	hm, I get you
2016-05-26 15:13:55	@Espyo	but "German WW2 tank" would be the most peaceful solution
2016-05-26 15:14:40	Yoshi2	but that would be boring
2016-05-26 15:15:18	Yoshi2	well, I will make the comparison screenshots and then they can still decide whether to make it more or less specific

2016-05-26 15:34:22	UnknownPikmin	yesterday
2016-05-26 15:34:32	UnknownPikmin	its fake
2016-05-26 15:34:48	UnknownPikmin	but can pikmin spaz out?
2016-05-26 15:35:12	UnknownPikmin	Testyo help
2016-05-26 15:35:12	Testyo	Help file: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47921869/Permanent/Testyo/Help.html Ask Espyo for more info!
2016-05-26 15:35:13	@Espyo	is this glitch real or not?
2016-05-26 15:35:25	UnknownPikmin	 its rumored
2016-05-26 15:35:47	UnknownPikmin	 but sometimes i think pikmin can spaz in odd ways
2016-05-26 15:36:55	UnknownPikmin	Testyo list quotes
2016-05-26 15:36:55	Testyo	List of quotes: http://37.189.123.43:8080/Pikipedia/quotes
2016-05-26 15:37:26	@Espyo	rumoured by whom?
2016-05-26 15:37:46	UnknownPikmin	me
2016-05-26 15:38:07	UnknownPikmin	but its not real though
2016-05-26 15:38:14	@Espyo	...
2016-05-26 15:38:21	@Espyo	do you understand how glitches work?
2016-05-26 15:38:30	UnknownPikmin	*sunset warning occurs*
2016-05-26 15:38:34	UnknownPikmin	and yes
2016-05-26 15:38:48	@Espyo	then you should know that it doesn't work that way
2016-05-26 15:38:51	@Espyo	you can't just rumour a glitch
2016-05-26 15:38:54	@Espyo	and then say it's not real
2016-05-26 15:38:57	UnknownPikmin	they are caused by the game or the player's actions
2016-05-26 15:39:08	UnknownPikmin	also it's sunset
2016-05-26 15:40:40	UnknownPikmin	so you better gather your stray pikmin
2016-05-26 15:41:00	UnknownPikmin	or else they wont survive.
2016-05-26 15:41:16	Yoshi2	what's the glitch?
2016-05-26 15:41:40	UnknownPikmin	It's sunset, Yoshi2.
2016-05-26 15:42:00	UnknownPikmin	Getting close to sunset actually.
2016-05-26 15:42:43	UnknownPikmin	Get all your stray pikmin before the day ends, or you will lose them.
2016-05-26 15:46:03	Yoshi2	that's not a glitch though, that is how the game works
2016-05-26 15:46:53	UnknownPikmin	no really sunset is going to occur and im a pikmin

2016-05-26 16:02:46	Testyo	This is a little crazy numbers, over here
2016-05-26 16:03:06	UnknownPikmin	Testyo 100
2016-05-26 16:03:06	Testyo	I see what you're saying, but windows
2016-05-26 16:03:26	UnknownPikmin	testyo serious
2016-05-26 16:03:27	Testyo	Only Espyo can tell me to enter serious mode!
2016-05-26 16:03:40	UnknownPikmin	Espyo?
2016-05-26 16:03:53	@Espyo	yes?
2016-05-26 16:04:27	UnknownPikmin	Me, you and testyo need to have a serious chat.
2016-05-26 16:04:28	Testyo	mhm less damage too
2016-05-26 16:05:12	UnknownPikmin	This is about the Pikipedia-Pikmin wiki merge.
2016-05-26 16:05:36	@Espyo	okay?
2016-05-26 16:05:59	UnknownPikmin	I heard about it on Pikmin Fanon
2016-05-26 16:06:18	@Espyo	yes
2016-05-26 16:06:23	@Espyo	but that happened almost two years ago
2016-05-26 16:06:40	UnknownPikmin	We may want Testyo's serious mode.
2016-05-26 16:06:40	Testyo	I used python and networkx to create the graph structure, and another program to avoid ambiguity - for example, a filename might contain a tab or new line character
2016-05-26 16:06:51	@Espyo	explain
2016-05-26 16:07:30	UnknownPikmin	We're describing if there will be a mass change for Pikipedia when the merge occurs
2016-05-26 16:08:28	@Espyo	uhm
2016-05-26 16:08:31	@Espyo	like I said, it happened almost two years ago
2016-05-26 16:08:32	UnknownPikmin	but really, we could have a pikmin 4
2016-05-26 16:08:45	@Espyo	the merge happened, got cleaned up over the months, and now it's all over
2016-05-26 16:09:03	UnknownPikmin	What if there was Pikmin 4
2016-05-26 16:09:24	@Espyo	there is going to be a Pikmin 4
2016-05-26 16:09:26	@Espyo	it was already confirmed
2016-05-26 16:09:40	UnknownPikmin	We need to talk about it
2016-05-26 16:09:58	UnknownPikmin	About adding the page to the wiki
2016-05-26 16:10:02	@Espyo	[[Pikmin 4]]

2016-05-26 16:10:04	@Espyo	it's already here ^
2016-05-26 16:11:00	UnknownPikmin	We need to add a new feature to Pikipedia
2016-05-26 16:11:17	@Espyo	what
2016-05-26 16:11:42	UnknownPikmin	Like an Upload Wizard on Inkipedia
2016-05-26 16:12:22	@Espyo	[[Special:Upload]] we already have it
2016-05-26 16:12:22	Testyo	"Special:Upload" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:Upload
2016-05-26 16:12:28	@Espyo	it's not a proper wizard
2016-05-26 16:12:42	@Espyo	but it gives the user some steps to follow to categorize images and such
2016-05-26 16:12:59	UnknownPikmin	What about a Page Wizard?
2016-05-26 16:13:17	-->	PikFan (Mibbit@fxpw-848-69.shs.lane.edu) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-26 16:13:17	@Espyo	no need for that one
2016-05-26 16:13:20	UnknownPikmin	That allows the user to create multiple pages at once
2016-05-26 16:13:20	@Espyo	every page is different
2016-05-26 16:13:21	PikFan	hi
2016-05-26 16:13:29	@Espyo	the user NEVER needs to create multiple pages at once
2016-05-26 16:13:31	@Espyo	EVER
2016-05-26 16:13:36	PikFan	Mibbit's being dumb again and won't let me log in :|
2016-05-26 16:13:41	UnknownPikmin	Oh, really?
2016-05-26 16:13:43	@Espyo	even if Pikmin 4 releases and the user wants to create a page for every enemy
2016-05-26 16:13:44	@Espyo	they can

2016-05-26 16:13:54	@Espyo	but they have to create one, add enough content, and only then move on the other
2016-05-26 16:13:57	UnknownPikmin	Hey PikFan?
2016-05-26 16:13:59	@PikFan	Espyo: what did I walk into this time
2016-05-26 16:14:04	@PikFan	hi UnknownPikmin
2016-05-26 16:14:05	@Espyo	a wizard that would create several dozen pages at once would be a HORRIBLE idea
2016-05-26 16:14:12	@Espyo	can you imagine twenty empty pages created at once?
2016-05-26 16:14:22	UnknownPikmin	I have a question.
2016-05-26 16:14:27	@Espyo	if the pages are going to be empty, they can as well be created in their own time
2016-05-26 16:14:29	Yoshi2	hi PikFan 
2016-05-26 16:14:33	@PikFan	hi Yoshi2
2016-05-26 16:15:06	UnknownPikmin	Espyo, what about a Moving Wizard?
2016-05-26 16:15:23	@Espyo	no such thing
2016-05-26 16:15:27	@Espyo	and pages rarely need to be moved
2016-05-26 16:15:37	UnknownPikmin	That allows the user to move several pages at once
2016-05-26 16:15:47	@Espyo	in the special scenario where pages need to be moved in bulk, that's a very dangerous and highly-impacting procedure
2016-05-26 16:15:51	@Espyo	so only admins and staff should do it
2016-05-26 16:15:54	@Espyo	and for that, there are tools
2016-05-26 16:16:03	@Espyo	even if there aren't, moving pages individually once isn't going to kill anybody
2016-05-26 16:16:09	UnknownPikmin	or a deletion wizard for MASSIVE deletions
2016-05-26 16:16:15	@Espyo	no need for that either
2016-05-26 16:16:18	@PikFan	why do you want wizards
2016-05-26 16:16:29	@Espyo	before you make suggestions, think about whether we actually NEED them first, okay?
2016-05-26 16:17:07	UnknownPikmin	What new feature could WE add to Pikipedia, Espyo and PikFan?
2016-05-26 16:17:14	@Espyo	none, for now
2016-05-26 16:17:18	@Espyo	we don't need anything
2016-05-26 16:17:42	Yoshi2	a deletion wizard for massice deletions would be a horrible idea, imagine people deleting all pages at once
2016-05-26 16:17:48	Yoshi2	even good pages
2016-05-26 16:18:29	UnknownPikmin	Yoshi, you're right.
2016-05-26 16:19:12	@PikFan	well of course he's right :P

2016-05-26 16:25:03	@Espyo	it'd just cause a big mess
2016-05-26 16:25:09	@Espyo	and why would we delete Pikipedia, may I ask?
2016-05-26 16:25:42	UnknownPikmin	Because after the transfer there would be no data on Pikipedia anymore

2016-05-26 17:28:09	Yoshi2	him leaving feels like heaven
2016-05-26 17:29:15	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-26 17:29:23	Yoshi2	and with the addition of tcrf, I now have to scroll pretty far down to check it
2016-05-26 17:29:40	Yoshi2	but I think hanging around in the channel will be worth it
2016-05-26 17:29:47	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-26 17:39:00	Yoshi2	I loaded the model into blender and I'm having trouble getting the texture to blend correctly :/
2016-05-26 17:39:15	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-26 17:39:23	@Espyo	imports to Sketchup work fine
2016-05-26 17:39:29	@Espyo	but I don't think I ever tried importing to Blender
2016-05-26 17:42:04	Yoshi2	the basic texture of this model works fine, but it has a second texture for the number and I can't get that one to blend correctly
2016-05-26 17:42:16	Yoshi2	it is repeated several time
2016-05-26 17:43:18	Yoshi2	I could give sketchup a try, I guess
2016-05-26 17:44:48	@Espyo	ouch, that sucks
2016-05-26 17:53:39	Yoshi2	sketchup 2016 doesn't support vista :|
2016-05-26 17:54:33	@Espyo	uuuuuuggggghhhhh
2016-05-26 18:06:33	Yoshi2	2015 doesn't either, of course
2016-05-26 18:07:17	Yoshi2	god, if you exist, please give me a version of sketchup that I can run
2016-05-26 18:07:41	Yoshi2	alternatively I could install sketchup on my notebook but I don't have that much space right now
2016-05-26 18:28:54	@Espyo	virtual machine?
2016-05-26 18:29:00	@Espyo	anyway I hate this
2016-05-26 18:29:02	@Espyo	so simple a task
2016-05-26 18:29:09	@Espyo	and then something stops you from taking the simplest path
2016-05-26 18:29:12	@Espyo	that sucks, but hey, it happens
2016-05-26 18:29:20	@Espyo	what DOESN'T happen is the next path also being blocked
2016-05-26 18:29:21	@Espyo	and the next
2016-05-26 18:29:23	@Espyo	and all paths possible
2016-05-26 18:29:42	@Espyo	until you have to create your own universe from scratch, atom by atom, where you actually can do the task you wanted to in the first place
2016-05-26 18:29:51	@Espyo	it's ridiculous how often it happens
2016-05-26 18:38:41	Yoshi2	I understand that they don't want to support an older platform anymore, but at least give me a version of the program that still works

2016-05-26 18:57:29	Yoshi2	meeeeeeeeh
2016-05-26 18:58:29	Yoshi2	sketchup blends the texture by default correctly, but it still has the repeated texture thing
2016-05-26 18:59:26	@Espyo	that's so weird
2016-05-26 18:59:36	@Espyo	I imported a couple of models and don't remember having this problem
2016-05-26 18:59:41	@Espyo	you might be able to do something about it though
2016-05-26 19:00:55	@Espyo	in OpenGL, you'd likely fix this by setting the texture "clamp" to "edge"
2016-05-26 19:01:05	@Espyo	see if there's a similar option on Sketchup or something
2016-05-26 19:01:57	Yoshi2	sketchup complains about not being able to update the evaluation time
2016-05-26 19:02:03	Yoshi2	SUCK IT SKETCHUP

2016-05-26 19:05:27	Yoshi2	sketchup has almost no tools out of the box
2016-05-26 19:05:55	Yoshi2	and I tried to download something and it didn't work
2016-05-26 19:06:40	@Espyo	good grief

2016-05-26 19:09:53	Yoshi2	in blender I did check out the UV mapping for this model, seems it is actually mapped this way so that the texture repeats
2016-05-26 19:10:06	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is anything to restrict that
2016-05-26 19:10:09	Marty2000	Hello
2016-05-26 19:10:15	Yoshi2	wb Marty2000, you missed a lot
2016-05-26 19:10:21	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-26 19:10:23	Marty2000	Oh! :/
2016-05-26 19:11:04	Yoshi2	for example, unknownpikmin suggested merging with wikia again
2016-05-26 19:11:10	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-26 19:11:41	Marty2000	I couldn't connect at all today, horrible for me. So... that's a bad idea, to say the least
2016-05-26 19:11:51	Marty2000	But why??
2016-05-26 19:13:09	Marty2000	Well, he's new to Pikipedia, so maybe he doesn't know many things... still, it's surprising that he knows there was a merge before
2016-05-26 19:15:02	Yoshi2	he also suggested a page wizard for adding several pages at once and a deletion wizard for deleting several pages at once
2016-05-26 19:15:14	Marty2000	I see

2016-05-26 19:16:09	Yoshi2	even if we wanted, that is not an option anymore because we are not in control of the wikia wiki anymore
2016-05-26 19:16:52	Marty2000	And the wikia seems dead somehow
2016-05-26 19:17:04	Marty2000	Not totally, but not many juicy stuff gets added

2016-05-26 19:25:59	Marty2000	<Espyo>	you can't just rumour a glitch May 26 16:38:54 <Espyo>	and then say it's not real   Why does he make false glitches? That's not really funny... 
2016-05-26 19:26:08	@Espyo	no idea

2016-05-26 19:28:04	Marty2000	No idea :p May 26 17:05:12 <UnknownPikmin>	This is about the Pikipedia-Pikmin wiki merge. Seems this is where everything began
2016-05-26 19:29:51	Marty2000	May 26 17:13:59 <PikFan>	Espyo: what did I walk into this time | He he
2016-05-26 19:32:14	Marty2000	May 26 17:23:36 <UnknownPikmin>	but we could reverse-transfer and send all Pikipedia data to the Pikmin Wiki | I feel like he's from Pikmin Wikia
2016-05-26 19:34:35	@Espyo	I think he's just dumb
2016-05-26 19:35:16	Marty2000	May 26 17:37:12 <UnknownPikmin>	PikFan, can I have op? | Hmm, sure.
2016-05-26 19:36:13	Marty2000	May 26 17:41:13 <UnknownPikmin>	Helpful changes, PikFan. | I think it would be more helpful to add information to existing pages.
2016-05-26 19:37:39	Marty2000	Thanks Yoshi2, that was cool! Finished reading everything
2016-05-26 19:37:56	Yoshi2	np
2016-05-26 19:38:03	Yoshi2	it was truly a work of art what he wrote
2016-05-26 19:38:44	Marty2000	Well, that was... unexpected
2016-05-26 19:43:04	Yoshi2	Espyo: for some reason, blender actually renders the texture correctly if I make it render the scene
2016-05-26 19:43:10	@Espyo	|:
2016-05-26 19:43:13	@Espyo	that makes little sense
2016-05-26 19:43:36	Yoshi2	but the part with the texture is rendered black because the texture throws a shadow on it
2016-05-26 19:43:46	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-26 19:51:15	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Astringent_Clump I have a question (again). Does every fruit have an artwork?
2016-05-26 19:51:29	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Citrus_Lump For example, this one received one
2016-05-26 19:51:48	Marty2000	Oh, the artwork from P2 is missing, by the way
2016-05-26 19:51:56	UltraMario	hey marty

2016-05-26 19:59:24	UnknownPikmin	Marty, can you pluck Pikmin mid air?
2016-05-26 20:00:01	Marty2000	Yes, but they might be hurt after falling... :/
2016-05-26 20:01:02	UnknownPikmin	I think they'll land on solid ground
2016-05-26 20:01:21	UnknownPikmin	So they won't be hurt ;)

2016-05-26 20:15:07	@Espyo	in most servers, this is based on your IP address
2016-05-26 20:15:21	@Espyo	so if you those two accounts had the same hostname, they probably have the same IP address

2016-05-26 20:15:44	@Espyo	or the server kinda sucks at retrieving them from your ISP

2016-05-26 21:52:37	Yoshi2	the picture of the model from bmdview is pretty poor, so I made new renders which I showed you earlier
2016-05-26 21:52:50	Yoshi2	but I will use them tomorrow because the person is asleep right now
2016-05-26 21:53:01	Marty2000	Okay

2016-05-26 22:06:26	StarWolf	I'm really happy. I was FINALLY able to create an idea for the second boss in my fan game. 
2016-05-26 22:07:08	Marty2000	Oh! Cool!
2016-05-26 22:07:18	Marty2000	What is it, if you don't mind telling me?
2016-05-26 22:08:15	StarWolf	In my notes it says "Boss is some sort of parasite similar to slug-cow-thing in pikmin 2 bathroom cave area". 
2016-05-26 22:09:24	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-26 22:10:43	StarWolf	*shrug* It's something, at least... I had a different idea, but was told that it was to gruesome.

2016-05-27 00:05:12	@PikFan	hi
2016-05-27 00:05:44	@PikFan	why does this exist http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:The_Shadow_Queen.png
2016-05-27 00:05:53	@PikFan	it was uploaded today by a user who also joined today
2016-05-27 00:08:57	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-27 00:09:26	@Espyo	>uploader is Kirbybulborbisgod
2016-05-27 00:09:29	@Espyo	found your answer
2016-05-27 00:09:42	@PikFan	is that user on Pikipedia too
2016-05-27 00:10:48	@Espyo	kirbybulborb is the cancerous kiddie on the wikia
2016-05-27 00:10:53	@Espyo	so this is either an alt account of his
2016-05-27 00:11:01	@Espyo	or a troll account, since it's praising him
2016-05-27 00:11:03	@PikFan	...joy
2016-05-27 00:11:12	@PikFan	is it possible to check his IP on wikia
2016-05-27 00:11:23	Gamefreak75	ive asked the wikia admins before
2016-05-27 00:11:27	Gamefreak75	they refuse to
2016-05-27 00:11:32	@PikFan	blah
2016-05-27 00:11:43	@PikFan	well, that's not surprising
2016-05-27 00:12:03	Gamefreak75	best bet is to just keep an eye on them and ban them when they get unruly
2016-05-27 00:12:18	 *	@PikFan adds that to the list of reasons of why the wikia admins are so constipated
2016-05-27 00:12:33	@PikFan	eh, doubt they'll do much
2016-05-27 00:12:40	@PikFan	but yeah I'll keep an eye out
2016-05-27 00:13:00	@PikFan	if anything, Espyo or Cheepy might do the banning, not me
2016-05-27 00:14:50	@Espyo	banning on where?
2016-05-27 00:15:08	@PikFan	on Fanon
2016-05-27 00:15:12	@PikFan	if he gets out of hand
2016-05-27 00:15:17	@Espyo	and why won't you?
2016-05-27 00:15:27	@PikFan	I'm not saying I won't
2016-05-27 00:15:51	@PikFan	but there's been some spam attacks that happened and I wasn't even aware of them until they already happened
2016-05-27 00:16:04	@PikFan	and by then you already shut them down :P
2016-05-27 00:16:25	@PikFan	I'm just saying, you're quicker at catching unruly users
2016-05-27 00:18:16	@PikFan	Kirbyddd claims: "Sorry I'm not of any help right now, but if any new info on Pikmin 4 becomes available, I'll have it up here the day it's announced."
2016-05-27 00:18:19	@PikFan	let's see you try
2016-05-27 00:18:54	@PikFan	but unlike on your wiki, our wiki has many users that will hunt for information
2016-05-27 00:19:00	@PikFan	we've got a big advantage
2016-05-27 00:20:08	@PikFan	on their "Announcements" page:
2016-05-27 00:20:18	@PikFan	"Some Pikmin related information from Super Smash Bros 4 is missing and needs to be added."
2016-05-27 00:20:19	@PikFan	and
2016-05-27 00:20:22	@PikFan	"Our Pikmin Short Movies article could use a lot of work."
2016-05-27 00:20:41	@PikFan	except there's no need, Pikipedia already has plenty of information on both
2016-05-27 00:20:50	@PikFan	so they're wasting their time
2016-05-27 00:20:58	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-27 00:21:10	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-27 00:21:28	@PikFan	I wonder how much trouble I'd get into if I physically destroyed one of wikia's servers
2016-05-27 00:21:48	@PikFan	I think...that might be a felony?
2016-05-27 00:22:01	@PikFan	of course, I won't do it
2016-05-27 00:32:42	@Espyo	invasion and destruction of property
2016-05-27 00:32:47	@Espyo	it'd land you a few years in jail
2016-05-27 00:32:54	@Espyo	plus they probably have backups elsewhere
2016-05-27 00:33:11	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-27 00:33:23	@PikFan	if you can't beat 'em, join 'em
2016-05-27 00:33:26	@PikFan	...kidding!
2016-05-27 00:34:00	@Espyo	going now, but before I leave
2016-05-27 00:34:08	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-05-27 00:34:20	@Espyo	this happened today while I was trying to implement a better particle effect system https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpkots12tp56crk/Solar%20flare.gif?dl=0
2016-05-27 00:35:17	@PikFan	congrats, you've now achieved a random while disk

2016-05-27 12:08:49	Yoshi2	I wonder if I should ping einstein on irc too
2016-05-27 12:12:43	@Espyo	hm, maybe after a bit
2016-05-27 12:12:52	@Espyo	chat's been pretty quiet, so this is the first post in a while
2016-05-27 12:12:55	@Espyo	I'm sure he'll notice
2016-05-27 12:13:26	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-05-27 12:17:26	Marty2000	http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/blZro2PAxbBGDe2S31MUAdP-xRWlH9j8 I love how their gallery contains screenshots from an early version of the game
2016-05-27 12:19:33	Yoshi2	I've seen promotional screenshots for battalion wars 2 that showed a level from early development
2016-05-27 12:20:05	Yoshi2	and I've seen promotional screenshots that were made at a higher resolution with anti aliasing than what the Wii would be capable of
2016-05-27 12:21:07	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkGawXjsltc I love this video
2016-05-27 12:21:18	Marty2000	Hmm... that's quite strange, it doesn't show the actual game at all
2016-05-27 12:21:18	@Espyo	Marty2000: yeah, it's so dumb
2016-05-27 12:21:25	@Espyo	most of them are prototype images
2016-05-27 12:21:31	Marty2000	Yes...
2016-05-27 12:21:39	@Espyo	we already uploaded them to the wiki
2016-05-27 12:21:58	Marty2000	Yes, I saw that
2016-05-27 12:22:10	@Espyo	they might've ran it on a computer to get a high-resolution AA screenshot
2016-05-27 12:22:57	Marty2000	Oh, a bilboquet
2016-05-27 12:23:13	Marty2000	I had one when I was younger
2016-05-27 12:27:33	@Espyo	looks like we had a different toy as kids
2016-05-27 12:27:41	@Espyo	I say "looks like" because those are older than my youth days
2016-05-27 12:27:48	@Espyo	uh...I don't know its name though :|
2016-05-27 12:28:10	@Espyo	but it has a double-cone all by itself, and then you have like a jump-rope rope
2016-05-27 12:28:28	@Espyo	and you're meant to keep the center of the two cones (that are pointing at each other) on top of the rope
2016-05-27 12:28:34	@Espyo	and you twist the rope about and do whatever
2016-05-27 12:28:39	@Espyo	ugh, it's pretty complicated to explain
2016-05-27 12:28:43	@Espyo	images would probably help a ton
2016-05-27 12:29:01	@Espyo	anyway, I loved his explanation of preservation of angular momentum and how you can just cheat with it
2016-05-27 12:30:21	Marty2000	I think I see what it is, Espyo
2016-05-27 12:30:42	Marty2000	http://www.renaud-bray.com/ImagesEditeurs/PG/297/297684-gf.jpg This?
2016-05-27 12:30:58	@Espyo	that's it!
2016-05-27 12:31:04	@Espyo	did you find a name?
2016-05-27 12:31:15	Marty2000	In France, we call it Diabolo
2016-05-27 12:31:45	Marty2000	And it's also the name of a drink :p
2016-05-27 12:31:57	Marty2000	I'll verify for English, not sure if it's Diabolo too
2016-05-27 12:32:13	Marty2000	http://www.wordreference.com/fren/diabolo Seems it's Diabolo too in English
2016-05-27 12:40:59	@Espyo	hm, I think I remember that name
2016-05-27 12:40:59	@Espyo	that might be it
2016-05-27 13:04:56	Yoshi2	by the previous trends, I probably have around 3-4 more hours to ping einstein before he goes to bed

2016-05-27 14:09:54	Marty2000	Yoshi2, how would you write this : "Fleisch-ranzen" or "Fleischeanzen"?
2016-05-27 14:10:00	Marty2000	I'd say the latter, but I'm not sure
2016-05-27 14:10:23	Marty2000	Fleischranzen*
2016-05-27 14:11:00	Yoshi2	pretty sure it is Fleischranzen

2016-05-27 15:26:44	Testyo	I'd take a guess that _do_ compete - practically every office suite supported MS Office formats before they were open specifications

2016-05-27 15:31:56	Yoshi2	what are you going to use to make the bot?
2016-05-27 15:32:25	UnknownPikmin	Several might be taken from Testyo.
2016-05-27 15:32:25	Testyo	but yeah, capitalization for highlighting is really effective, isn't it
2016-05-27 15:32:33	UnknownPikmin	*commands
2016-05-27 15:33:25	UnknownPikmin	The command PikBot GTHO is a command to tell PikBot to quit.

2016-05-27 15:47:35	Testyo	yeah... of advice
2016-05-27 15:47:44	Yoshi2	you will have to test your bot in a different channel

2016-05-27 16:13:54	Marty2000	Probably because you don't have to move a lot when on ground.
2016-05-27 16:14:12	@PikFan	yeah

2016-05-27 16:47:10	@Espyo	PikFan: yeah, Scruffy's subpage could work
2016-05-27 16:47:46	@Espyo	Yoshi2: he can say whatever he wants, doesn't mean we have to listen
2016-05-27 16:49:49	Yoshi2	I'm just saying that for a moment he got my hopes up that maybe he might have a bit of sanity in his mind, and then he destroys those hopes

2016-05-27 16:53:41	UnknownPikmin	Hello, PikFan
2016-05-27 16:54:44	UnknownPikmin	Anyone here?
2016-05-27 16:54:47	@PikFan	hi
2016-05-27 16:55:08	UnknownPikmin	So I have a chatbot idea today
2016-05-27 16:55:19	UnknownPikmin	It's called PikBot
2016-05-27 16:55:23	Marty2000	Welcome back...
2016-05-27 16:55:58	UnknownPikmin	Espyo?
2016-05-27 16:56:14	@PikFan	gotta go, sorry
2016-05-27 16:56:15	@PikFan	bye
2016-05-27 16:56:16	Marty2000	Testyo's entertainment feature might become useless, in the future :D
2016-05-27 16:56:16	Testyo	Why not discuss a neutral "he"
2016-05-27 16:56:17	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@vyra-100-39.shs.lane.edu) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-05-27 16:56:19	Marty2000	Bye PikFan
2016-05-27 16:56:24	UnknownPikmin	bai
2016-05-27 16:56:59	UnknownPikmin	So PikBot's got more games. 20, actually.
2016-05-27 16:57:44	UnknownPikmin	Espyo?
2016-05-27 16:59:12	@Espyo	yes?
2016-05-27 16:59:36	UnknownPikmin	You do know about PikBot, right?
2016-05-27 16:59:53	@Espyo	did you make it already?
2016-05-27 17:00:02	UnknownPikmin	Not yet.
2016-05-27 17:00:17	@Espyo	right
2016-05-27 17:00:34	UnknownPikmin	I'll release something called PikBot Beta, in the future :/
2016-05-27 17:01:09	UnknownPikmin	which is an indev version of PikBot
2016-05-27 17:01:22	@Espyo	any idea when?
2016-05-27 17:01:54	UnknownPikmin	TBD.
2016-05-27 17:02:22	UnknownPikmin	testyo age
2016-05-27 17:02:23	Testyo	So, at Espyo
2016-05-27 17:02:31	UnknownPikmin	testyo how old
2016-05-27 17:02:32	Testyo	why, who's future of the emulator
2016-05-27 17:02:41	UnknownPikmin	testyo how old are you
2016-05-27 17:02:42	Testyo	I was born on 8/4/2012, which means I am 4 years, 1 month and 19 days old!
2016-05-27 17:05:05	UnknownPikmin	To ask questions about PikBot, join #PikBot or #PikBotAlt
2016-05-27 17:06:17	UnknownPikmin	Or get more info join #PikInfo
2016-05-27 17:12:41	@Espyo	Marty2000: I remember asking this before, but I don't remember the answer http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Glitches_in_Pikmin_2&curid=8423&diff=163880&oldid=163879
2016-05-27 17:12:47	UnknownPikmin	If you're chatting from Pikmin Fanon, join #pikminfanon
2016-05-27 17:13:09	@Espyo	with the Snagrets and Pellet Posies, do they die if they do something else, without being hit any more?
2016-05-27 17:13:30	@Espyo	like, the Dweevils die instantly if they release the treasure, even if they're not hurt
2016-05-27 17:13:35	@Espyo	is it the same with the other enemies you listed?
2016-05-27 17:13:47	@Espyo	UnknownPikmin: people chatting from the Pikmin Fanon and about the Pikmin Fanon are meant to chat here, not elsewhere
2016-05-27 17:14:21	Marty2000	No, they can still eat Pikmin. However, they will die whenever something hits them, and for the Burrowing Snagret, you can even try to hit its body. Also, I don't think you can use an Ultra-Bitter spray on it
2016-05-27 17:14:36	@Espyo	weird...
2016-05-27 17:14:42	@Espyo	the Dweevil one makes sense for a reason
2016-05-27 17:14:44	@Espyo	I might've explained before
2016-05-27 17:14:56	@Espyo	but basically, in its "carrying something" state, it has no code to handle the case where it has 0 HP
2016-05-27 17:15:01	Marty2000	Yes, and I could reproduce it once
2016-05-27 17:15:05	Marty2000	I see.
2016-05-27 17:15:09	@Espyo	because, normally, its HP cannot go to 0 when it is in its "carrying state"
2016-05-27 17:15:16	UnknownPikmin	*No-Pikmin Softlock Glitch Occurs*
2016-05-27 17:15:28	@Espyo	since if you punch it or attack it, it simply drops the treasure without losing HP
2016-05-27 17:15:42	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-27 17:15:46	@Espyo	in the case of the other enemies, I'm not sure if it's also a case of "in this state, there is no code to handle a 0 HP death"
2016-05-27 17:16:02	UnknownPikmin	Espyo, I have a question.
2016-05-27 17:16:14	@Espyo	just ask away instead of asking to ask
2016-05-27 17:16:23	Marty2000	I'll try to get more info or videos on it, Espyo, so that it may help you
2016-05-27 17:16:29	@Espyo	please try
2016-05-27 17:16:38	UnknownPikmin	Can Pikmin be cloned?
2016-05-27 17:16:43	@Espyo	because I'm not too fond of the idea of saying other enemies have the same glitch when it might not even be a glitch in the first place
2016-05-27 17:16:51	@Espyo	they could just have like 0.1 HP, which rounds to 0 on the wheel
2016-05-27 17:16:59	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-27 17:17:01	@Espyo	UnknownPikmin: yes, with glitches
2016-05-27 17:17:31	UnknownPikmin	I have found a glitch
2016-05-27 17:17:54	Marty2000	Espyo, I can try later, but now now, I have to do something quite important. I'll try in more or less 1 hour. Is that okay for you?
2016-05-27 17:18:00	Marty2000	not now*
2016-05-27 17:18:02	@Espyo	sure thing
2016-05-27 17:18:05	@Espyo	don't feel pressured
2016-05-27 17:18:07	Marty2000	Okay :)
2016-05-27 17:18:24	Marty2000	Oh, don't worry, just telling you so that you're not waiting for nothing.
2016-05-27 17:18:31	@Espyo	ah heh
2016-05-27 17:18:33	@Espyo	fine with me

2016-05-27 17:52:59	@Espyo	it's pointless
2016-05-27 17:56:11	Marty2000	What's the poil. I cannot see it. I'm going to watch your video
2016-05-27 17:56:16	Marty2000	(and then try for P2)
2016-05-27 17:56:33	@Espyo	the latest poll UnknownPikmin made
2016-05-27 17:56:43	@Espyo	oh, I guess it's impossible to see it anyway, since the server is down
2016-05-27 17:56:46	@Espyo	hm, I should take care of that today
2016-05-27 17:56:59	@Espyo	anyway, that video isn't mine, it's a different playthrough of the same level, getting a Perfect
2016-05-27 17:57:09	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-27 17:57:09	@Espyo	look how fast it is, and how many times you have to flick the stylus PERFECTLY to the beat
2016-05-27 17:57:14	@Espyo	it's so hard... and I finally did it after like a year
2016-05-27 17:57:15	Marty2000	Nevertheless, I'll watch it
2016-05-27 17:57:22	Marty2000	Congrats!
2016-05-27 17:57:25	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-05-27 17:57:33	@Espyo	it feels great to finally get a Perfect on this
2016-05-27 17:59:41	Marty2000	That's cool!
2016-05-27 18:00:40	@Espyo	I highly recommend anybody that likes rhythm to try this series
2016-05-27 18:00:42	@Espyo	it's phenomenal
2016-05-27 18:01:10	Marty2000	I could play the DS version some years ago, I liked it a lot
2016-05-27 18:01:15	Marty2000	I heard there's one on WII
2016-05-27 18:01:17	Marty2000	WIi
2016-05-27 18:01:19	Marty2000	Wii*
2016-05-27 18:01:32	Marty2000	But I haven't really checked
2016-05-27 18:01:45	@Espyo	yeah, there is
2016-05-27 18:01:49	@Espyo	I'm one Perfect away on that one
2016-05-27 18:01:57	@Espyo	but I'm still like 4 Perfects away on the DS one
2016-05-27 18:02:04	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-27 18:02:16	@Espyo	Megamix is going to come out this year on the 3DS
2016-05-27 18:02:20	Marty2000	"Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise"
2016-05-27 18:02:23	@Espyo	and it's a compilation of older mini-games and some new ones
2016-05-27 18:02:28	@Espyo	yeah, that's the European title
2016-05-27 18:02:28	Marty2000	I'll probably buy it then
2016-05-27 18:02:32	@Espyo	Rhythm Heaven Fever in America
2016-05-27 18:02:37	@Espyo	if you liked the DS one, definitely get the Wii one
2016-05-27 18:02:39	@Espyo	it's a step up
2016-05-27 18:02:48	@Espyo	or the 3DS one
2016-05-27 18:03:15	Marty2000	I wish it were on the Eshop
2016-05-27 18:03:43	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-27 18:04:52	Marty2000	https://www.amazon.fr/Beat-the-Rhythm-Paradise/dp/B007YBZSLY I consider buying it... EUR 6,79 on Amazon :p
2016-05-27 18:05:08	@Espyo	amazingly cheap
2016-05-27 18:05:11	@Espyo	I got mine for 10
2016-05-27 18:05:12	@Espyo	so...
2016-05-27 18:05:16	Marty2000	To make things even better, it's even sent by Amazon
2016-05-27 18:05:30	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-27 18:10:07	Marty2000	Ok, I'm going to try to get a zombie Pellet Posy first
2016-05-27 18:10:22	Marty2000	I call them zonbie
2016-05-27 18:10:25	Marty2000	zombie*
2016-05-27 18:11:41	@Espyo	woo!
2016-05-27 18:11:47	@Espyo	now I got a Perfect on Remix 10, the last level
2016-05-27 18:11:54	@Espyo	one of the hardest...but somehow not as hard as Rhythm Rally 2
2016-05-27 18:11:56	@Espyo	I'm on fire today!
2016-05-27 18:12:03	Marty2000	:)
2016-05-27 18:12:08	@Espyo	all right, good luck Marty
2016-05-27 18:12:11	Yoshi2	nice
2016-05-27 18:12:23	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-27 18:12:28	@Espyo	gah, I love this feeling
2016-05-27 18:12:34	@Espyo	of fighting against a hard level for ages
2016-05-27 18:12:37	@Espyo	and then finally beating it
2016-05-27 18:12:47	@Espyo	and the thing about getting Perfects is that you know you've beaten it the best way possible
2016-05-27 18:12:53	@Espyo	the game WON'T let you make a mistake
2016-05-27 18:12:58	@Espyo	so you really feel like you're perfect at it
2016-05-27 18:13:10	Marty2000	I got one
2016-05-27 18:13:15	Marty2000	Yep!
2016-05-27 18:13:28	Yoshi2	yup, that feeling is great
2016-05-27 18:13:49	@Espyo	already? how common is that glitch anyway?
2016-05-27 18:14:20	Marty2000	Hmm, I don't know, but I no longer know whether it's a glitch or not, now. I'm uploading the video so that you can see how it happened.
2016-05-27 18:14:26	@Espyo	right
2016-05-27 18:14:38	Yoshi2	I was very proud of getting a 100% in project mirai 
2016-05-27 18:16:42	@Espyo	hm, never heard of that one
2016-05-27 18:17:02	Yoshi2	hatsune miku: project mirai
2016-05-27 18:17:15	@Espyo	woah, that doesn't look easy
2016-05-27 18:17:19	@Espyo	seeing some gameplay footage
2016-05-27 18:17:29	@Espyo	man, congrats on getting 100%
2016-05-27 18:18:05	Yoshi2	I only got 100% on a stage on easy or normal, I think
2016-05-27 18:18:13	Yoshi2	on Hard, the game is insane
2016-05-27 18:18:20	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-27 18:18:21	@Espyo	still
2016-05-27 18:18:29	@Espyo	wait, let me see the difficulty of the video I saw
2016-05-27 18:18:35	@Espyo	( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THB0_PiPoFI )
2016-05-27 18:18:56	@Espyo	doesn't say, but it looks hard
2016-05-27 18:19:23	Yoshi2	that looks like Hard difficulty
2016-05-27 18:19:56	Yoshi2	on easy, you only have A and B, on normal you have A, B and Y (or X?) and on hard you have A, B, Y and X
2016-05-27 18:20:40	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-27 18:20:42	@Espyo	then it's Hard
2016-05-27 18:20:42	Yoshi2	some people actually complained about project mirai being too easy compared to other entries in the series
2016-05-27 18:20:47	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/i5D4PCJbID4
2016-05-27 18:20:58	@Espyo	eep
2016-05-27 18:21:10	Yoshi2	I say, it's difficult enough for me
2016-05-27 18:23:03	@Espyo	I'm on the same boat
2016-05-27 18:23:10	@Espyo	apparently the GBA Rhythm Heaven game is much harder
2016-05-27 18:23:18	@Espyo	because it makes you rely more on reflexes and trial and error
2016-05-27 18:23:22	@Espyo	I say the DS game is hard enough, thank you
2016-05-27 18:25:02	Yoshi2	I've seen some project diva gameplay and that game really clutters the screen with stuff
2016-05-27 18:27:17	@Espyo	scary
2016-05-27 18:28:00	Testyo	where'd that but too bad we don't have em here
2016-05-27 18:29:49	Yoshi2	Marty2000: pretty interesting, I wonder if there is a damage value for flowers that makes it look like it is dead, and yet it isn't actually dead
2016-05-27 18:30:10	Marty2000	It also happens for the Burrowing Snagret
2016-05-27 18:30:17	Marty2000	And the Pileated Snagret
2016-05-27 18:30:28	Marty2000	Seems it doesn't happen for any other enemy, though
2016-05-27 18:30:31	Marty2000	Which is... odd
2016-05-27 18:31:39	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-27 18:31:43	@Espyo	I'll try to do the same with Dolphin
2016-05-27 18:31:48	@Espyo	and read the HP variable
2016-05-27 18:31:55	@Espyo	but first, I'm on a roll on Rhythm Heaven, so :P
2016-05-27 18:31:55	Marty2000	Ok
2016-05-27 18:32:03	Marty2000	He he, no problem
2016-05-27 18:32:11	Marty2000	I'll explain you how to do:
2016-05-27 18:32:20	Marty2000	Punch the Pellet Posy once
2016-05-27 18:32:38	Marty2000	And then, you must throw a Pikmin
2016-05-27 18:32:49	Marty2000	And whistle it before the Pellet Posy completely dies
2016-05-27 18:33:53	@Espyo	ok, I'll try that
2016-05-27 18:34:25	Marty2000	I tried to clean my Wii U
2016-05-27 18:34:29	Marty2000	Let's see if P1 works
2016-05-27 18:34:43	@Espyo	did you use the cleaning kit?
2016-05-27 18:35:07	Marty2000	No, but I used another solution I sawon Youtube
2016-05-27 18:35:10	Marty2000	saw on*
2016-05-27 18:35:38	Marty2000	No, doesn't work.
2016-05-27 18:36:14	@Espyo	hm, I hope that solution you saw doesn't end up destroying your disc lens :|
2016-05-27 18:37:11	Marty2000	Well it doesn't work anyway, so I won't retry it. I guess I'll have to buy the cleaning kit...
2016-05-27 18:37:23	Marty2000	But it's odd because my other games work perfectly on my Wii U
2016-05-27 18:37:31	Marty2000	I had a similar problem once with my Wii
2016-05-27 18:38:10	@Espyo	yeah, maybe try cleaning the disc itself
2016-05-27 18:39:01	Marty2000	I did
2016-05-27 18:39:15	@Espyo	damn...
2016-05-27 18:39:59	Marty2000	Not only didn't it work, but the disc is cleaned as well.

2016-05-27 18:46:11	@Espyo	oh?
2016-05-27 18:46:19	Marty2000	A glitch hunter group or something like that
2016-05-27 18:46:43	Marty2000	We try to find glitches for speedrunning
2016-05-27 18:46:55	@Espyo	that's awesome!
2016-05-27 18:47:11	@Espyo	I should join as well
2016-05-27 18:47:21	@Espyo	although I don't hunt much for them, I do help discovering more data about them
2016-05-27 18:47:28	Marty2000	Yes! There are well known people in the group, like Ice-Cube
2016-05-27 18:47:40	@Espyo	awesome!
2016-05-27 18:47:46	Marty2000	Sure, I'll ask if I can invite you, since I'm not the admin
2016-05-27 18:48:00	@Espyo	I don't use Discord that often
2016-05-27 18:48:08	@Espyo	mostly only when I'm playing something online and want to talk to friends
2016-05-27 18:48:09	@Espyo	but still
2016-05-27 18:48:17	Marty2000	Neither do I, but that's still interesting
2016-05-27 18:49:50	Marty2000	Ok, I've just asked.
2016-05-27 18:50:08	Marty2000	You will see the chat is pretty much dead, unless someone makes a new dicovery
2016-05-27 18:50:14	Marty2000	But it's still awesome
2016-05-27 18:50:15	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-27 18:50:17	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-27 18:50:54	@Espyo	GAAAH
2016-05-27 18:51:09	@Espyo	I hate how Pikmin just decide to start doing stuff by themselves as soon as they get out of the Onion, in P2
2016-05-27 18:51:18	Marty2000	Ah, yeah
2016-05-27 18:51:23	@Espyo	this Red hit the Pellet Posy I was going to use
2016-05-27 18:51:49	@Espyo	oh, that was easy
2016-05-27 18:51:53	@Espyo	looks like it's easy to reproduce then
2016-05-27 18:51:55	Marty2000	I don't like how Pikmin work in P2, most of the time
2016-05-27 18:51:59	Marty2000	I prefer P1 and P3
2016-05-27 18:52:05	@Espyo	I prefer P3 above all
2016-05-27 18:52:07	@Espyo	but P2 over P1
2016-05-27 18:52:15	@Espyo	in P1 they have a mind of their own, fall on their own...
2016-05-27 18:52:20	Marty2000	P3 is great for this

2016-05-27 18:58:42	UnknownPikmin	I just found a glitch
2016-05-27 18:59:05	UnknownPikmin	That make enemies die instantly
2016-05-27 18:59:19	UnknownPikmin	GAAAH
2016-05-27 18:59:20	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-27 18:59:22	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-27 18:59:30	@Espyo	I've got three addresses for the HP value of that Pellet Posy
2016-05-27 18:59:40	@Espyo	after the "glitch", two of them say 0, the other says 20
2016-05-27 18:59:50	@Espyo	but that 20 could mean something else if you convert it to a decimal value
2016-05-27 19:00:00	@Espyo	not quite sure which one to trust
2016-05-27 19:00:06	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-05-27 19:00:08	Marty2000	Interesting!
2016-05-27 19:00:15	@Espyo	none of them make sense with what we know for the HP values of the Pellet Posy

2016-05-27 19:08:35	@Espyo	so do the Snagrets
2016-05-27 19:08:35	Testyo	so many have some more features and such

2016-05-27 19:08:53	@Espyo	but it doesn't make sense for...
2016-05-27 19:08:54	@Espyo	wait...
2016-05-27 19:08:59	@Espyo	ok, so a Pellet Posy has 50 HP
2016-05-27 19:09:02	@Espyo	a Pikmin attacks for 15
2016-05-27 19:09:06	@Espyo	and a leader attacks for 7.5
2016-05-27 19:09:20	UnknownPikmin	ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
2016-05-27 19:09:29	@Espyo	if you punch first, that makes its HP 42.5
2016-05-27 19:09:35	@Espyo	then you get the Pikmin to attack it
2016-05-27 19:09:40	Yoshi2	UnknownPikmin: stop spamming please
2016-05-27 19:09:45	Pi	I'm pretty sure if you work with hexadecimal values for long enough, you start building up an intuition for them.
2016-05-27 19:09:56	UnknownPikmin	Hello Pi!
2016-05-27 19:10:06	Pi	Hi, UnknownPikmin.
2016-05-27 19:10:06	@Espyo	 42.5 -> 27.5 -> 12.5 -> -2.5
2016-05-27 19:10:10	@Espyo	nope, doesn't make sense
2016-05-27 19:10:28	@Espyo	Pi: that is true, and I don't have much of a problem with hex
2016-05-27 19:10:36	Yoshi2	Pi: not if the value is supposed to be interpreted as a float
2016-05-27 19:10:41	UnknownPikmin	OK, so the Plasm Wraith has 1500 HP
2016-05-27 19:10:46	@Espyo	but when you've got to convert 0x813E0000 to a floating point number, you might as well look at a wall, since you'll never get it
2016-05-27 19:10:48	Marty2000	Maybe it's rounded to 0 without making the plant/enemy die if it goes below 0
2016-05-27 19:11:02	@Espyo	if the final number was 0.5, I'd trust that
2016-05-27 19:11:05	@Espyo	but it's not...
2016-05-27 19:11:10	@Espyo	let me follow the address carefully
2016-05-27 19:12:16	UnknownPikmin	If you attack with a Pikmin it goes to 1485
2016-05-27 19:12:23	Marty2000	?
2016-05-27 19:12:42	UnknownPikmin	Then you punch
2016-05-27 19:14:40	UnknownPikmin	1500 -> 1485 -> 1478.5
2016-05-27 19:16:05	UnknownPikmin	I don't like that Pikmin can die in 1 hit

2016-05-27 19:16:48	@Espyo	nope, the variable changes exactly the way I said it would by counting down the 7.5 from the leaders and the 15 from the Pikmin
2016-05-27 19:17:12	@Espyo	I wonder if this is because of the way the Pikmin attacks...

2016-05-27 19:17:27	@Espyo	I'll try to force its HP to be 12.5, and then have a Pikmin do a "normal" attack
2016-05-27 19:17:33	@Espyo	instead of an attack where it's "inside" the flower
2016-05-27 19:17:50	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-27 19:17:55	UnknownPikmin	That would make it -3.5
2016-05-27 19:18:00	@Espyo	oh, that's it!
2016-05-27 19:18:19	@Espyo	it only glitches because the Pikmin is "inside" the Pellet Posy when attacking
2016-05-27 19:18:28	@Espyo	which might use a different damage routine
2016-05-27 19:18:36	UnknownPikmin	I can't reaaly discuss this.
2016-05-27 19:18:40	@Espyo	which is all broken, apparently

2016-05-27 19:19:34	Marty2000	Interesting, maybe it's the same with the Snabreks because of their bodies
2016-05-27 19:19:49	@Espyo	yeah, it's easy to see this by playing normally too
2016-05-27 19:19:54	@Espyo	if you punch, then let the Pikmin attack freely
2016-05-27 19:20:00	@Espyo	it will go "inside" and do the 0 HP thing
2016-05-27 19:20:09	@Espyo	if you whistle the Pikmin each time it attacks
2016-05-27 19:20:13	@Espyo	you'll see it's the exact same damage
2016-05-27 19:20:19	UnknownPikmin	I found out something
2016-05-27 19:20:31	@Espyo	but because it's just doing its standard "ground attack" animation, it will actually kill the Posy at 0, instead of glitching
2016-05-27 19:20:44	UnknownPikmin	a creature's corpse is unretrivable if it fallst into water
2016-05-27 19:20:45	Marty2000	Oh, I see
2016-05-27 19:20:53	@Espyo	UnknownPikmin: Blue Pikmin
2016-05-27 19:20:56	Marty2000	So that's because of the animation...
2016-05-27 19:21:06	Marty2000	somehow*
2016-05-27 19:21:09	@Espyo	anyway, it might be the same thing with the Snagrets, but I don't think the Pikmin do the same animation
2016-05-27 19:21:42	Marty2000	The damage calculation is different when you attack the body
2016-05-27 19:21:48	UnknownPikmin	I tried to get drowning pikmin over to another side
2016-05-27 19:22:01	UnknownPikmin	only 2 survived:\
2016-05-27 19:22:15	Marty2000	:/8
2016-05-27 19:22:17	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-27 19:22:25	@Espyo	hm, but the same doesn't really happen if you let the Pikmin attack it from full health
2016-05-27 19:22:29	@Espyo	it only works if you punch it
2016-05-27 19:22:32	@Espyo	let me try a different Pikmin
2016-05-27 19:22:39	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-27 19:22:42	Marty2000	Like... a Purple one
2016-05-27 19:22:45	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-27 19:22:45	UnknownPikmin	What about Rock?
2016-05-27 19:23:10	@Espyo	oh, Purples work right away
2016-05-27 19:23:11	Marty2000	Or another type amongst Blue, Yellow, White 
2016-05-27 19:23:16	@Espyo	they hit grounded once, then they grab and pummel twice
2016-05-27 19:23:18	Marty2000	Without punching?
2016-05-27 19:23:20	@Espyo	and it goes to the zombie stage
2016-05-27 19:23:22	@Espyo	without punching, yep
2016-05-27 19:23:23	Marty2000	Wow
2016-05-27 19:23:28	@Espyo	so the punch is not part of the problem
2016-05-27 19:23:32	Marty2000	Good fin!
2016-05-27 19:23:35	Marty2000	find*
2016-05-27 19:23:48	@Espyo	it's definitely just the way the damage is dealt and the death is checked
2016-05-27 19:23:58	@Espyo	being a programmer definitely helps in understanding this
2016-05-27 19:24:02	@Espyo	bonus points for developing a Pikmin engine
2016-05-27 19:24:08	Marty2000	:)
2016-05-27 19:24:14	@Espyo	some parts of the canon games probably work the same way I coded some of my own stuff
2016-05-27 19:24:16	UnknownPikmin	3 other Pikmin would equal 1 purple pikmin if they're carrying something
2016-05-27 19:24:28	@Espyo	on the engine, Pikmin have an "attacking_grounded" state and an "attacking_latched" state
2016-05-27 19:24:37	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-05-27 19:24:39	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-27 19:24:45	@Espyo	and every time their attacks connect, they call a function to do the damage and check for deaths
2016-05-27 19:24:49	@Espyo	luckily they call the same function on my end
2016-05-27 19:24:54	@Espyo	otherwise I could get a problem like this
2016-05-27 19:25:08	@Espyo	also the most common task I get at work is solving bugs
2016-05-27 19:25:15	@Espyo	meaning I have to try things to try to understand why a bug happens
2016-05-27 19:25:21	@Espyo	so what I'm doing right now is just another day's work
2016-05-27 19:25:29	@Espyo	pretty fun
2016-05-27 19:25:35	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-27 19:26:02	UnknownPikmin	If a Pikmin attacks a Bulborb's eye is the damage multiplies?

2016-05-27 19:40:01	@Espyo	what in the world...!
2016-05-27 19:40:05	@Espyo	ok, so I've concluded
2016-05-27 19:40:10	UnknownPikmin	UnknownPikmin.exe encountered an error and had to be shut down.
2016-05-27 19:40:17	@Espyo	that this only happens on the pummelling animation
2016-05-27 19:40:17	@Espyo	AND
2016-05-27 19:40:23	@Espyo	on the second time the Pikmin pummels
2016-05-27 19:40:33	@Espyo	if it's the first pummel since a grab, everything works fine
2016-05-27 19:40:36	@Espyo	if it's the third, fine
2016-05-27 19:40:42	@Espyo	if it's the second, it fails to kill
2016-05-27 19:40:59	@Espyo	didn't check 4th or more
2016-05-27 19:41:04	@Espyo	so it could just be even numbers
2016-05-27 19:41:41	UnknownPikmin	I found something
2016-05-27 19:42:00	Marty2000	What is it?
2016-05-27 19:42:01	UnknownPikmin	that you might like
2016-05-27 19:42:10	Marty2000	Also Espyo, in the [[Punch]] article
2016-05-27 19:42:11	Testyo	"Punch" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Punch
2016-05-27 19:42:30	Marty2000	I think we should mention that it's possible for leaders to attack things Pikmin cannot attack
2016-05-27 19:42:34	Marty2000	At least in P3
2016-05-27 19:42:47	@Espyo	huh? like what?
2016-05-27 19:42:51	Marty2000	They can punch fire geysers in P1 and P3 (even though no damage is dealt)
2016-05-27 19:42:54	UnknownPikmin	Let's have Pi join in on this conversation.
2016-05-27 19:43:03	@Espyo	also, I was wondering if maybe the 2nd hit of a pummel caused different damage, but it doesn't
2016-05-27 19:43:07	Marty2000	And the leaders can punch the shell of a Joustmit in P3
2016-05-27 19:43:15	@Espyo	oh, interesting
2016-05-27 19:43:17	@Espyo	yeah, definitely add that
2016-05-27 19:43:58	UnknownPikmin	FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
2016-05-27 19:44:13	@Espyo	while you add that, I'll try some other objects to see if the fourth, fifth, etc. pummels also glitch out
2016-05-27 19:44:17	UnknownPikmin	i just lost all mypp pikmin
2016-05-27 19:44:23	UnknownPikmin	 my*
2016-05-27 19:44:38	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-27 19:44:52	Marty2000	Sorry again UnknownPikmin
2016-05-27 19:45:18	Marty2000	Hmm, I think I can add that in a Trivia section, Espyo, or should it be in the article itself? Not sure
2016-05-27 19:45:24	@Espyo	in the article
2016-05-27 19:45:35	@Espyo	it's a list with at least 3 items
2016-05-27 19:45:46	@Espyo	plus I'd say it's kind of important for players to know
2016-05-27 19:45:58	@Espyo	if they're so scared of a Joustmite, it's important for them to know they can deal with safely with a leader
2016-05-27 19:46:06	@Espyo	(you'll be punching it for several hours, but that's another problem)
2016-05-27 19:46:11	<--	UnknownPikmin (Mibbit@mjyr-02-564-93-585.knology.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-05-27 19:46:21	@Espyo	plus, this kinda extends to a different fact:
2016-05-27 19:46:28	@Espyo	the fact that leaders can damage any "enemy"-like object
2016-05-27 19:46:32	@Espyo	I don't know the specifics
2016-05-27 19:46:37	@Espyo	but for one thing, fire geysers are enemies
2016-05-27 19:46:39	@Espyo	in all three games
2016-05-27 19:46:39	@Espyo	so
2016-05-27 19:46:40	Yoshi2	wait a moment
2016-05-27 19:46:45	Yoshi2	leaders can damage anything?
2016-05-27 19:46:50	Yoshi2	TIL
2016-05-27 19:46:51	@Espyo	yeah, with their dinky punches
2016-05-27 19:47:00	@Espyo	in P1 and P2, the punches are actually okay
2016-05-27 19:47:06	@Espyo	especially in P2 after you get the [[Rocket Fist]]
2016-05-27 19:47:06	Testyo	"Rocket_Fist" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Rocket_Fist
2016-05-27 19:47:14	@Espyo	but in P3... it's like hitting an elephant with a spoon
2016-05-27 19:47:35	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-27 19:48:11	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/9VDvgL58h_Y Reminds me of this video
2016-05-27 19:49:55	Marty2000	I have to wait for an admin to send you the invitation, Espyo
2016-05-27 19:50:13	@Espyo	okay
2016-05-27 19:50:21	@Espyo	hehe, classic
2016-05-27 19:50:25	@Espyo	I was thinking of that when I said it
2016-05-27 19:50:28	@Espyo	minus the elephant part, I guess
2016-05-27 19:50:47	UltraMario	Marty2000: sent a request
2016-05-27 19:50:56	@Espyo	oh! actually
2016-05-27 19:50:58	@Espyo	at ComicCon
2016-05-27 19:51:02	@Espyo	one guy cosplayed as that killer
2016-05-27 19:51:04	@Espyo	it was so funny
2016-05-27 19:51:08	Marty2000	Ha
2016-05-27 19:51:53	@Espyo	wow!
2016-05-27 19:52:05	@Espyo	it looks like if the number of pummels is even...
2016-05-27 19:52:13	@Espyo	and that pummel causes its health to drop to 0
2016-05-27 19:52:15	@Espyo	it won't kill
2016-05-27 19:52:18	@Espyo	but if the number is odd
2016-05-27 19:52:19	@Espyo	it will kill
2016-05-27 19:52:24	@Espyo	I wonder if this works on other enemies too
2016-05-27 19:52:46	Marty2000	Wow
2016-05-27 19:52:51	Marty2000	Great !
2016-05-27 19:52:55	Marty2000	Great!*
2016-05-27 19:54:01	@Espyo	at least, I'm only testing on Pellet Posies
2016-05-27 19:54:13	@Espyo	I'm allowing the Pikmin to pummel a lot more times
2016-05-27 19:54:20	@Espyo	by forcing the health to be full until I say it should drop normally
2016-05-27 19:54:27	@Espyo	and I'm counting how many pummels the Pikmin does
2016-05-27 19:54:32	@Espyo	this is wrong on so many levels
2016-05-27 19:54:52	@Espyo	honestly, they could've coded the logic for this in any crazy way
2016-05-27 19:54:57	@Espyo	this makes so little sense that I can't just guess

2016-05-27 19:56:44	Marty2000	I'm currently talkign with Ice-Cube, and he's telling me you can move enmies and pellets with Alph and Day 1
2016-05-27 19:56:48	Marty2000	on day 1*
2016-05-27 19:56:53	@Espyo	odd
2016-05-27 19:56:55	Marty2000	And it could be used to get out of bounds
2016-05-27 19:57:13	@Espyo	oh!
2016-05-27 19:57:18	@Espyo	I hope it can be used to kill Pikmin too
2016-05-27 19:57:24	@Espyo	I'd love to see what happens on a day-1 extinction
2016-05-27 19:57:26	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-05-27 19:57:30	@Espyo	we know it's possible to kill them
2016-05-27 19:57:32	Marty2000	You want to try to get a Pikmin extinction
2016-05-27 19:57:36	@Espyo	since people have reported their Pikmin disappearing on the first dirt wall
2016-05-27 19:57:37	Marty2000	Yes I know
2016-05-27 19:57:39	Marty2000	With the gate
2016-05-27 19:57:44	@Espyo	crazy stuff
2016-05-27 20:09:23	@Espyo	ok, this doesn't work with a Dwarf Red Bulborb
2016-05-27 20:10:17	@Espyo	now I'm wondering what's so different between the Snagrets, Pellet Posies, and the rest
2016-05-27 20:11:22	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/CCVwNn9VwGw Either this can make Alph go out of bounds, either you can't do anything with that... "glitch"
2016-05-27 20:11:45	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-27 20:11:50	@Espyo	that's giving me some strong Sonic Adventure vibes
2016-05-27 20:12:02	@Espyo	you walk against certain walls, and if you start spazzing out, 9 times out of 10, you can clip out of bounds
2016-05-27 20:12:17	Marty2000	Oh yeah
2016-05-27 20:12:21	Marty2000	I remember
2016-05-27 20:13:33	Yoshi2	in nintendo games it is much less likely to get past the wall
2016-05-27 20:13:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-27 20:17:00	@Espyo	oh!
2016-05-27 20:17:03	@Espyo	got the Zombie Dweevil glitch
2016-05-27 20:17:07	@Espyo	and just as I thought
2016-05-27 20:17:26	@Espyo	it's not related to the Pellet Posy thing at all
2016-05-27 20:17:32	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-27 20:17:42	@Espyo	if you hurt a Dweevil just as it is grabbing up a thing
2016-05-27 20:17:43	@Espyo	it happens
2016-05-27 20:17:46	@Espyo	exactly like I thought
2016-05-27 20:17:59	@Espyo	it likely enters a "scooping something up" state
2016-05-27 20:18:02	@Espyo	where it is vulnerable
2016-05-27 20:18:07	@Espyo	but this state doesn't have an event for handling death
2016-05-27 20:18:14	@Espyo	and then afterwards, it enters the "carrying something" state
2016-05-27 20:18:21	@Espyo	which again, does not have an event, for the reason I explained earlier
2016-05-27 20:18:38	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-27 20:18:43	@Espyo	and when you make it release the object
2016-05-27 20:18:46	@Espyo	it enters its "normal" state
2016-05-27 20:18:53	@Espyo	and in this state, since it does have an event for checking death
2016-05-27 20:18:54	@Espyo	it does
2016-05-27 20:18:57	@Espyo	and it decides it should die
2016-05-27 20:19:16	@Espyo	aww, I wish I had a spray
2016-05-27 20:19:20	@Espyo	to see what would happen if I sprayed it

2016-05-27 20:39:50	Marty2000	Nothing else than what I've laready told you before
2016-05-27 20:39:55	Marty2000	I don't know anything else (yet)
2016-05-27 20:40:00	@Espyo	I can't quite remember
2016-05-27 20:40:05	@Espyo	we talked so much about it, I didn't memorize it all :/
2016-05-27 20:40:06	Marty2000	already*
2016-05-27 20:40:17	@Espyo	can the Snagret be at 0 HP all the time?
2016-05-27 20:40:22	@Espyo	or only during a certain state, like when it's buried?
2016-05-27 20:40:27	Marty2000	Attacking the body at one point seems to affect whether it'll have 0 HP or not
2016-05-27 20:40:45	Marty2000	It can be at 0HP at all the time, as long as you don't attack its head or body
2016-05-27 20:41:02	@Espyo	that's really weird, then
2016-05-27 20:41:03	@Espyo	it works differently from all other enemies and objects
2016-05-27 20:42:44	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/Ux8s12vVr-c Almost! I'll try to bring more objects
2016-05-27 20:43:35	@Espyo	hah, that is so janky
2016-05-27 20:49:00	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/21/1464378531-oob.png I can also try here
2016-05-27 20:49:33	@Espyo	do we have any video anywhere of the zombie Pellet Posies?
2016-05-27 20:49:37	@Espyo	if not, I can upload it
2016-05-27 20:49:46	@Espyo	it'll also help me see how easily I can push out a video now that I'm on Linux
2016-05-27 20:50:23	Marty2000	I don't think we have any video, aside mine (but it doesn't explain anything, so go for it)
2016-05-27 20:50:41	@Espyo	I won't really explain it either, but I'll show the process of getting it to happen
2016-05-27 20:50:46	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-27 20:50:51	@Espyo	and now different Pikmin need different "methods"
2016-05-27 21:05:05	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@206.78.wr.nm) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-27 21:05:17	Neocraftz1553	Hello everyone
2016-05-27 21:05:18	Marty2000	Hi Neocraftz1553
2016-05-27 21:05:34	Neocraftz1553	So....
2016-05-27 21:05:40	Neocraftz1553	I got a cheap computer
2016-05-27 21:05:49	Neocraftz1553	cheap in price and performance :/
2016-05-27 21:05:55	Neocraftz1553	at least it works
2016-05-27 21:05:57	Marty2000	Sorry :/
2016-05-27 21:06:09	Neocraftz1553	don't be
2016-05-27 21:06:20	Neocraftz1553	as long as I have a computer that runs blender
2016-05-27 21:06:26	Neocraftz1553	I can practice on it
2016-05-27 21:06:38	Neocraftz1553	and I can now try to learn C++ again
2016-05-27 21:06:38	Yoshi2	hi neo
2016-05-27 21:06:40	Neocraftz1553	somewhat
2016-05-27 21:06:44	Neocraftz1553	hey Yoshi2
2016-05-27 21:07:30	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: your channel belongs to me now because your nickname registration was dropped
2016-05-27 21:07:51	Neocraftz1553	hmm, ok
2016-05-27 21:07:58	Neocraftz1553	I wasn't that active
2016-05-27 21:08:32	Yoshi2	as part of my new business strategy i will turn the channel into a hub for neo-conservatives and neo-nazis
2016-05-27 21:08:51	Marty2000	:D
2016-05-27 21:09:01	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-05-27 21:09:07	Neocraftz1553	sound good, I guess :p
2016-05-27 21:09:51	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-27 21:10:02	@Espyo	I thought OpenShot was the only decent video editor for Linux around
2016-05-27 21:10:16	@Espyo	it used to be a simple little thing
2016-05-27 21:10:21	@Espyo	but they had a kickstarter some years ago to make it better
2016-05-27 21:10:25	@Espyo	and have released betas recently
2016-05-27 21:10:31	@Espyo	...it's as bad as windows movie maker
2016-05-27 21:10:34	@Espyo	so I searched for alternatives
2016-05-27 21:10:39	@Espyo	and I'm trying out Kdenlive
2016-05-27 21:10:44	@Espyo	good grief it's like heaven
2016-05-27 21:11:01	Yoshi2	I like ffmpeg
2016-05-27 21:11:29	@Espyo	and the final video exported perfectly
2016-05-27 21:11:36	@Espyo	isn't ffmpeg like an encoder or something?
2016-05-27 21:11:39	@Espyo	not so much an editor?
2016-05-27 21:11:42	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2016-05-27 21:12:18	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-05-27 21:12:30	Neocraftz1553	I'm using Movie Maker on my '95 Espyo :p
2016-05-27 21:12:54	Klemen702	guise
2016-05-27 21:12:58	Neocraftz1553	Seriously though, I'm usiing Movie Maker
2016-05-27 21:13:03	Klemen702	i am mostly afking playing a game and not paying attention here
2016-05-27 21:13:04	Neocraftz1553	Hey Klemen702
2016-05-27 21:13:05	Klemen702	should i leave
2016-05-27 21:13:14	Neocraftz1553	I don't know
2016-05-27 21:13:25	Neocraftz1553	go on Yahoo Answers :p
2016-05-27 21:13:59	Neocraftz1553	not sure
2016-05-27 21:14:34	Neocraftz1553	Don't take advice from someone who forgot to disconnect and fell asleep
2016-05-27 21:16:07	Marty2000	Espyo, I've sent you the link to the Discord group
2016-05-27 21:16:17	Klemen702	u wot mate

2016-05-27 21:16:28	Marty2000	Enjoy your... Hmm, I won't say it, Yoshi2 will not appreciate it otherwise :p
2016-05-27 21:16:39	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-05-27 21:17:14	Marty2000	(how to confuse the entire chatroom)
2016-05-27 21:17:46	Klemen702	marty
2016-05-27 21:17:48	Klemen702	plz respond
2016-05-27 21:17:48	Yoshi2	you are confusing other people more than you are confusing me
2016-05-27 21:17:50	Klemen702	to my question
2016-05-27 21:17:52	Klemen702	that has no ?
2016-05-27 21:17:54	Klemen702	so it's not a question
2016-05-27 21:17:55	Klemen702	but still
2016-05-27 21:17:56	Marty2000	O know, Yoshi2
2016-05-27 21:18:06	Marty2000	I*
2016-05-27 21:18:10	Marty2000	So, Klemen702
2016-05-27 21:18:19	Marty2000	It's a special group reserved to glitch hunters
2016-05-27 21:18:29	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-05-27 21:18:35	Marty2000	It wasn't made by me, if you were wondering
2016-05-27 21:18:36	Klemen702	just glitch hunters
2016-05-27 21:18:43	Neocraftz1553	that sounds awsome
2016-05-27 21:18:47	Klemen702	it's not even piki? :x
2016-05-27 21:18:51	Klemen702	discord is too good
2016-05-27 21:19:09	Marty2000	It's about Pikmin, but it's not strictly reserved to Pikipedia
2016-05-27 21:19:10	Klemen702	infact i suggest we should move our everyday chatting place which is this place to discord
2016-05-27 21:20:46	Yoshi2	discord sucks
2016-05-27 21:20:53	Yoshi2	I can't use a monospace font
2016-05-27 21:22:25	Klemen702	monospace?
2016-05-27 21:22:27	Yoshi2	or change the font size
2016-05-27 21:22:34	Yoshi2	Klemen702: yes, monospace
2016-05-27 21:22:40	Klemen702	what is monospace
2016-05-27 21:22:56	Yoshi2	a monospace font is a font in which every character has the same width
2016-05-27 21:24:04	Klemen702	and... it matters?
2016-05-27 21:24:58	Neocraftz1553	same width
2016-05-27 21:25:12	Klemen702	point being?
2016-05-27 21:25:20	Neocraftz1553	isn't there one that every character has the same height?
2016-05-27 21:25:41	Neocraftz1553	OCD
2016-05-27 21:25:46	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-05-27 21:25:58	Yoshi2	Klemen702: more appealing to my eyes
2016-05-27 21:26:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-05-27 21:26:07	Yoshi2	also in programming monospace fonts are a must
2016-05-27 21:26:08	Klemen702	is this even monospace
2016-05-27 21:26:30	Klemen702	because this chat message and discord messages look the same to me
2016-05-27 21:26:35	Neocraftz1553	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-05-27 21:26:42	Yoshi2	I have set up my client to use a monospace font
2016-05-27 21:26:50	Klemen702	pics or didn't happen
2016-05-27 21:27:37	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-05-27 21:27:48	Neocraftz1553	No pics, no clicks

2016-05-27 21:30:19	Klemen702	change still doesn't look like a big deal to me :P
2016-05-27 21:30:22	Klemen702	but whatever
2016-05-27 21:30:36	Klemen702	i won't question the weirdness of weirdishly weirdish weird people
2016-05-27 21:30:58	Neocraftz1553	hah
2016-05-27 21:31:05	Yoshi2	stop talking if you do not want to lose your credibility ( °▽ °)
2016-05-27 21:31:12	Klemen702	what
2016-05-27 21:31:18	Neocraftz1553	I use Consolas

2016-05-27 21:31:44	Yoshi2	insulting monospace fonts will be met with death
2016-05-27 21:31:49	Yoshi2	and jail time
2016-05-27 21:31:51	Yoshi2	in that order
2016-05-27 21:31:57	Klemen702	wait
2016-05-27 21:31:59	Klemen702	i die
2016-05-27 21:32:00	Klemen702	and then
2016-05-27 21:32:01	Klemen702	my corpse
2016-05-27 21:32:04	Klemen702	goes to jail
2016-05-27 21:32:07	Klemen702	that's some good shit
2016-05-27 21:32:10	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-05-27 21:32:18	Neocraftz1553	you will be reanimated
2016-05-27 21:32:34	Klemen702	yoshi2 you're kinda mean
2016-05-27 21:32:40	Marty2000	So that you can enjoy your life in a new way, in jail ;)
2016-05-27 21:32:56	Neocraftz1553	heg
2016-05-27 21:32:58	Neocraftz1553	*heh
2016-05-27 21:33:20	Klemen702	idea: let's ban yoshi
2016-05-27 21:33:40	Yoshi2	another reason for monospace fonts: ASCII art that goes over multiple lines won't be messed up

2016-05-27 21:34:30	Neocraftz1553	It blocks up and cuts up tons of pages
2016-05-27 21:34:37	Neocraftz1553	plus, it gets messed up

2016-05-27 21:39:49	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-05-27 21:43:18	@J	ffmpeg is an encoder, but it's featureful enough to use for basic editing
2016-05-27 21:43:34	@J	in terms of scripting, you can do a huge amount of stuff, it just gets complicated
2016-05-27 21:43:42	Neocraftz1553	hey J
2016-05-27 21:43:45	@J	hi
2016-05-27 21:44:08	@J	in terms of other GUI video editors, I believe pitivi is also a viable option
2016-05-27 21:44:11	@J	never used it though
2016-05-27 21:44:31	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pitivi.org/
2016-05-27 21:45:26	Neocraftz1553	trying to find a better editor than Movie Maker
2016-05-27 21:45:50	Neocraftz1553	After that I might upgrade to Sony Vegas Pro, but...
2016-05-27 21:45:54	Neocraftz1553	that'll take a while
2016-05-27 21:46:12	Neocraftz1553	Its $90+ if I am not mistaken
2016-05-27 21:46:12	Testyo	$ 90 = 82.773 € / £ 58.491 
2016-05-27 21:47:02	Yoshi2	J: I usually just need to sync up audio with the video and maybe cut off stuff at the end and at the start, so ffmpeg works well enough with fairly little effort besides waiting
2016-05-27 21:47:19	Yoshi2	but I might look into pitivi at some point
2016-05-27 21:47:48	Neocraftz1553	I think I might go with pitivi
2016-05-27 21:48:04	Neocraftz1553	Movie Maker is pretty limited
2016-05-27 21:48:33	Marty2000	It seems to decrease the quality of your videos as well
2016-05-27 21:48:37	Marty2000	(Movie Maker)
2016-05-27 21:48:44	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-05-27 21:48:54	Neocraftz1553	Marty2000 it does
2016-05-27 21:49:05	Yoshi2	pitivi is mainly linux 
2016-05-27 21:49:11	Neocraftz1553	some videos quality decrease is noticeable
2016-05-27 21:49:31	Neocraftz1553	Yoshi2 hmmm...
2016-05-27 21:49:39	Yoshi2	Marty2000: yep, because movie maker uses specific codecs with specific settings that are anything but optimal
2016-05-27 21:49:57	Neocraftz1553	ANYTHING but optimal :|
2016-05-27 21:50:26	Neocraftz1553	sometimes theres gray pixels on some videos
2016-05-27 21:50:31	Neocraftz1553	like...
2016-05-27 21:51:07	Neocraftz1553	it blurs it up, then it decides to be even more of a jerk and colors many of the pixels gray for a few seconds
2016-05-27 21:51:25	Neocraftz1553	it shows up in the final product sometime :|

2016-05-27 21:57:22	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw1ytja45oU Cool!
2016-05-27 22:06:58	@Espyo	oh, forgot to post it
2016-05-27 22:10:44	Marty2000	Hmm... I'm wondering if it could be possible to finish day 1 with 19 Pikmin (theoretically) in P2. Among the 5 Pikmin fighting the Dwarf Red Bulborb at the start, you can just whistle 4, grow 9 Pikmin with Louie, squish the bag, and push the idle red Pikmin to the treasure with your Pikmin (without the captains)
2016-05-27 22:11:11	Marty2000	That idle Pikmin wouldn't count among the Pikmin you have.
2016-05-27 22:12:13	@Espyo	oh, good point
2016-05-27 22:12:57	Marty2000	I'll give it a try when I can... even though Pikmin 3 fed me up with trying to get out of bounds
2016-05-27 22:13:04	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-27 22:13:06	Marty2000	I couldn't find anything, unfortunately :/
2016-05-27 22:13:13	@Espyo	uhm, did I misspell "pallet" on my video?
2016-05-27 22:13:19	@Espyo	I got a comment saying "Zombie Pallet?"
2016-05-27 22:13:24	@Espyo	dunno what to make of it
2016-05-27 22:13:35	Marty2000	You wrote Pellet
2016-05-27 22:13:38	Marty2000	That's correct
2016-05-27 22:13:49	Marty2000	"Palet" is French
2016-05-27 22:13:56	Marty2000	I don't know for "Pallet"...
2016-05-27 22:14:08	@Espyo	yeah, and a pallet is what you use to carry heavy stuff with a forklift
2016-05-27 22:14:16	Marty2000	He or she might be wondering why you used "zombie"
2016-05-27 22:14:23	Marty2000	Oh, I see
2016-05-27 22:15:15	@J	in general the KDE applications are quite usable and polished out of the box
2016-05-27 22:15:37	@Espyo	I'll keep that in mind next time I'm struggling to find an application
2016-05-27 22:15:37	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-27 22:16:16	@J	the KDE way is lots of features and options, which works for some people
2016-05-27 22:16:57	@Espyo	but not for those that want something with good performance, I'd guess
2016-05-27 22:18:47	@J	depends what you mean
2016-05-27 22:18:54	@J	stuff like startup time is going to be bad, yeah
2016-05-27 22:19:12	@J	the heavy lifting parts (like the video editing) will be done by the same libraries no matter what you use
2016-05-27 22:19:35	@J	but there are plenty of people who prefer a simpler interface regardless of how it affects performance
2016-05-27 22:19:44	@Espyo	right
2016-05-27 22:20:06	@Espyo	oh, and I guess that stuff that's really low-level, like CLI-only, allows for MUCH better scripting and batching
2016-05-27 22:21:14	@J	yep
2016-05-27 22:21:40	@J	as far as GUIs go, I think KDE applications are good for batch processing and automation
2016-05-27 22:21:48	@J	but there's only so good that can get
2016-05-27 22:21:56	@J	.../weird sentence
2016-05-27 22:22:22	@Espyo	and yet, so right
2016-05-27 22:22:35	@Espyo	is it right?
2016-05-27 22:22:41	@Espyo	I mean, I know perfectly what you meant with that sentence
2016-05-27 22:22:48	@Espyo	but the more I read it, the more I think there's a weird version that's not so weird
2016-05-27 22:23:02	@Espyo	"but there's only so good it can get"?
2016-05-27 22:26:12	@J	'it can only get so good'
2016-05-27 22:26:35	@Espyo	well yeah, if you want the good sentence
2016-05-27 22:26:45	@Espyo	I was thinking of making the weird sentence sound correct, because it didn't feel correct
2016-05-27 22:32:35	Marty2000	Well, Espyo, it's impossible. After the idle Pikmin has dug out the buried treasure, it will follow you, but you can't order your Pikmin to carry the treasure (group move or throw)
2016-05-27 22:33:19	@Espyo	sorry, what is this in relation to?
2016-05-27 22:35:35	Marty2000	" Hmm... I'm wondering if it could be possible to finish day 1 with 19 Pikmin (theoretically) in P2. Among the 5 Pikmin fighting the Dwarf Red Bulborb at the start, you can just whistle 4, grow 9 Pikmin with Louie, squish the bag, and push the idle red Pikmin to the treasure with your Pikmin (without the captains)"
2016-05-27 22:35:45	Marty2000	What I said earlier
2016-05-27 22:36:38	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-05-27 22:36:54	@Espyo	well, that sucks...

2016-05-28 00:23:11	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-28 00:23:29	@Espyo	one of the things people searched for on the wiki this time: "king of bus"
2016-05-28 00:23:35	@Espyo	http://www.theecologist.org/siteimage/scale/0/0/94250.jpg laughed so hard
2016-05-28 00:23:35	@PikFan	lolwut
2016-05-28 00:23:53	@PikFan	lmao
2016-05-28 00:24:01	@J	makes all the sense
2016-05-28 00:24:06	@PikFan	ohey J
2016-05-28 00:24:10	@PikFan	thought you were dead
2016-05-28 00:24:15	@PikFan	oh wait, you were
2016-05-28 00:24:39	@Espyo	I get that it's a typo on the king of bugs
2016-05-28 00:24:51	@Espyo	but good grief, me and my mates just lost it on Discord
2016-05-28 00:26:07	@Espyo	...somebody searched "Porn"
2016-05-28 00:26:19	@PikFan	where are you getting this info?
2016-05-28 00:26:31	@Espyo	I thought you knew this already
2016-05-28 00:26:37	@PikFan	Google Analytics, right?
2016-05-28 00:26:40	@J	I didn't even realise the title
2016-05-28 00:26:43	@Espyo	but basically, a year ago or so, Prod gave me access to the google analytics account
2016-05-28 00:26:44	@J	*typo
2016-05-28 00:26:58	@Espyo	I had a feeling the typo wasn't that obvious
2016-05-28 00:27:03	@PikFan	this is Pikipedia, not Inkipedia :P
2016-05-28 00:27:08	@Espyo	it was to me, since quite a few of these searches are typos
2016-05-28 00:27:14	@Espyo	but if you see "king of bus" all of a sudden
2016-05-28 00:27:18	@Espyo	you're not going to be thinking of Louie
2016-05-28 00:28:02	@J	Louie can be king of whatever he wants to be
2016-05-28 00:28:08	@PikFan	is there a google analytics account for Fanon

2016-05-28 00:33:10	@Espyo	so
2016-05-28 00:33:12	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-28 00:33:36	@PikFan	speaking of Porple, I asked him about a year ago to fix the fatal error thing that hits Fanon all the time
2016-05-28 00:33:47	@PikFan	but he never fixed it, as you can tell :\
2016-05-28 00:33:57	@PikFan	Fanon used to have a good connection
2016-05-28 00:34:13	@PikFan	way back when I first joined
2016-05-28 00:34:32	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-28 00:35:50	@PikFan	well, I guess I'll ask Porple if he has a GA account for Fanon
2016-05-28 00:35:57	@PikFan	I'll also remind him to fix the fatal error
2016-05-28 00:37:05	@Espyo	mhm

2016-05-28 09:40:46	Marty2000	Now that I think of it, since you're here, you've probably already taken yours.
2016-05-28 09:40:52	Marty2000	I dunno what to eat... :p
2016-05-28 09:44:11	Marty2000	Okay, I've taken lemonade. What do you think, Yoshi2?
2016-05-28 09:47:30	Yoshi2	too sweet
2016-05-28 09:48:10	Marty2000	I see. I'll shake it in a bottle so that it reduces the amount of sugar. What else would you recommend me?
2016-05-28 09:53:32	Yoshi2	a proper breakfast that isn't just lemonade
2016-05-28 09:53:36	Yoshi2	:v)

2016-05-28 09:58:56	Marty2000	Hm
2016-05-28 09:58:58	Yoshi2	whatever you like
2016-05-28 09:59:03	Marty2000	I see.
2016-05-28 09:59:08	Yoshi2	I like meat and meat stuff
2016-05-28 09:59:15	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-28 09:59:22	Yoshi2	you can also skip breakfast and go straight to dinner
2016-05-28 09:59:34	Yoshi2	or whatever the next thing is that people eat
2016-05-28 09:59:36	Marty2000	I'll probably take a lunch beforehand
2016-05-28 09:59:43	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-28 09:59:44	Yoshi2	first meal of the day = breakfast imo
2016-05-28 10:00:04	Yoshi2	doesn't have to be the stereotypical breakfast you see on tv
2016-05-28 10:00:46	Marty2000	I know, those breakfast are too "heavy"
2016-05-28 10:00:49	Marty2000	breakfasts*
2016-05-28 12:25:27	Yoshi2	I'll make something spicy for myself
2016-05-28 12:25:33	Yoshi2	haven't eaten spicy stuff in weeks
2016-05-28 12:29:37	Marty2000	:)
2016-05-28 12:29:40	Marty2000	I've just finished eating
2016-05-28 12:29:44	Marty2000	I love spicy stuff too
2016-05-28 12:30:22	Marty2000	Hmm... especially fajitas... do you know that?

2016-05-28 12:46:58	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-05-28 12:46:58	Testyo	l beat stage two aswell but after asking somebody if I could do it, them going berserk and thinking I'm a slacker
2016-05-28 12:47:30	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-28 12:48:48	Marty2000	Hello Espyo and Testyo
2016-05-28 12:48:49	Testyo	so I think it tries to have offline progress?
2016-05-28 12:49:08	@Espyo	hey
2016-05-28 13:09:31	Yoshi2	Espyo: no plans to register your nick on badnik? Seems #tcrf gives out free voice for people with registered nicks
2016-05-28 13:12:34	@Espyo	hm, I thought I did
2016-05-28 13:12:36	@Espyo	but no, no plans
2016-05-28 13:12:41	@Espyo	why would I want voice?
2016-05-28 13:15:25	Yoshi2	because cool people have v o i c e
2016-05-28 13:15:43	@Espyo	D:
2016-05-28 13:15:45	Yoshi2	no particular reason, I just found out that tcrf gives out free voice when I registered my nick
2016-05-28 13:19:39	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-28 13:22:56	Marty2000	Do you think we will see UnknownPikmin again, today...?
2016-05-28 13:23:26	Yoshi2	I wouldn't mind if he didn't show up
2016-05-28 13:23:30	Yoshi2	:v)
2016-05-28 13:23:54	Marty2000	:p
2016-05-28 13:24:17	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-28 13:31:32	Marty2000	I'm not totally sure of what I'm saying, but it seems that each treasure has its own location on each area, in the Treasure Hoard. I mean, it seems not to be random.
2016-05-28 13:31:46	@Espyo	yeah, I think that's right
2016-05-28 13:31:51	@Espyo	some treasures are always in pools of water, for instance
2016-05-28 13:31:55	@Espyo	probably the same for enemies
2016-05-28 13:33:16	Marty2000	That's interesting, I'm checking... 
2016-05-28 13:33:26	Yoshi2	a part of me is curious about how his bot will turn out
2016-05-28 13:33:33	Yoshi2	I doubt he will write his own
2016-05-28 13:33:51	@Espyo	I doubt he'll write it, period
2016-05-28 13:34:11	@Espyo	he waltzes in here thinking stuff can just happen because he thinks it can
2016-05-28 13:35:22	Marty2000	He said he'd write his bot with Java, right?
2016-05-28 13:35:33	Yoshi2	that is what he claimed
2016-05-28 13:35:57	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-28 13:36:35	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-28 13:37:24	Yoshi2	I do hope it won't happen because that means less trouble with silly bots
2016-05-28 13:37:32	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z2chvQTA what am I missing here?
2016-05-28 13:37:39	@Espyo	I mean, sure, he ended with only one Pikmin of each type
2016-05-28 13:37:40	@Espyo	but so what?
2016-05-28 13:37:53	@Espyo	Yoshi2: he can do whatever he wants, he's not putting his bot here
2016-05-28 13:38:42	Marty2000	There's nothing so special... he could kill his entire squad of Pikmin but 1 of each type and beat the Plasm Wraith with those 5 Pikmin left
2016-05-28 13:38:56	Yoshi2	good point, if he brings the bot here the bot will be banned
2016-05-28 13:39:20	Marty2000	The problem is that he wants to make a bot without fun functions, like those of Testyo
2016-05-28 13:39:20	Testyo	another thing is trying to PROVE it sounds stupid
2016-05-28 13:39:32	Marty2000	Testyo is here to report changes, but is also a fun bot
2016-05-28 13:39:33	Testyo	inside Crystals. In one case, in the Garden of Hope, there is a overturned plant pot made of Fragments; when finished, it is used as a little different from other articles, sure
2016-05-28 13:39:43	Marty2000	I'm afraid he won't make the same kind of bot, to say the least
2016-05-28 13:39:52	Marty2000	But I don't reakky know, so I cannot say anything else.
2016-05-28 13:39:55	Marty2000	really*
2016-05-28 13:40:04	Yoshi2	he wants to make a bot with only fun functions
2016-05-28 13:40:10	Yoshi2	and no useful ones
2016-05-28 13:40:54	Marty2000	Really? Then, I didn't understand...
2016-05-28 13:41:02	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-28 13:41:21	Marty2000	I thought he had said something like "I want to make a bot more serious than Testyo"
2016-05-28 13:41:22	Testyo	seems to do that part fine for me, with source URL 'http://splatoon.wikia.com', source namespace 6, start file and half the time no one does
2016-05-28 13:41:27	@Espyo	yeah, I initially added Testyo to see how he'd fit in, but I made him enter serious mode because I specifically did not want him to be used for fun here
2016-05-28 13:41:27	Testyo	just when I suppose it only really causes any problems if there's a lot of disk activity and you're a brute
2016-05-28 13:41:34	@Espyo	only to see if he could have any use
2016-05-28 13:41:35	@Espyo	which he did
2016-05-28 13:41:41	@Espyo	mostly in the way he converted money and measurements
2016-05-28 13:41:54	@Espyo	and then I realized I could try adding the recent changes thing, and that was just a game changer
2016-05-28 13:42:09	@Espyo	chances are he probably said both of those things
2016-05-28 13:42:15	@Espyo	that he wanted a bot more serious than Testyo, and more fun
2016-05-28 13:42:15	Testyo	I died when I discovered that just documents the internals of the games
2016-05-28 13:42:50	Yoshi2	useful functions take effort
2016-05-28 13:43:12	Yoshi2	when I was making a memo plugin for my own bot, I had to learn how sql worked
2016-05-28 13:43:52	Marty2000	(Off-topic) Another "discovery": Hermit Crawmads are invincible when they are in their dens (at least in P3)
2016-05-28 13:44:46	@Espyo	pfft, sql
2016-05-28 13:44:53	@Espyo	I store Testyo's everything in plaintext
2016-05-28 13:44:53	Testyo	is using making a template function for creating a tower as a member of the base class UnplacedTower a good idea or fuel tank
2016-05-28 13:44:59	@Espyo	because I don't believe in basic security or privacy
2016-05-28 13:45:17	@Espyo	no, but seriously, Testyo was never meant to be used to discuss the Panama Papers
2016-05-28 13:45:17	Testyo	uh a good drawer
2016-05-28 13:45:21	@Espyo	just silly memos back and forth
2016-05-28 13:45:31	@Espyo	so I never bothered to make it support anything other than plaintext
2016-05-28 13:45:33	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-28 13:45:42	@Espyo	Marty2000: how can you tell?
2016-05-28 13:45:44	Yoshi2	I don't believe either which is why my bot doesn't check if an user is authed :P
2016-05-28 13:46:02	Marty2000	Espyo: You will see soon. I wondr if it's the same for Pikmin 2
2016-05-28 13:46:16	Marty2000	But basically, I used the "Invincible Pikmin" glitch
2016-05-28 13:46:35	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-28 13:46:54	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/zxMw6rzCrWU
2016-05-28 13:49:36	Marty2000	I could try in P2 using an action replay code
2016-05-28 13:49:46	Marty2000	To make a Pikmin invincible
2016-05-28 13:49:58	Marty2000	And that's what I'm going to do...
2016-05-28 13:50:50	@Espyo	oh yeah, you can hear the "bop!" when it's underground
2016-05-28 13:50:56	@Espyo	like hitting a Joustmite's shell
2016-05-28 13:52:18	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-28 13:55:20	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlNSpIzHQ woah, language
2016-05-28 13:57:10	Marty2000	Ok, that's the same

2016-05-28 14:01:33	@Espyo	ah yes
2016-05-28 14:01:37	@Espyo	that's the weird cyan one

2016-05-28 14:09:40	Marty2000	The player should have at least 1 red pIKMIN AT THE END

2016-05-28 14:35:15	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlMsBvssg What wiki is he talking about?
2016-05-28 14:35:20	Marty2000	[[Punch]]

2016-05-28 14:36:17	Marty2000	Ok, he's not talking about Pikipedia
2016-05-28 14:36:53	Marty2000	"Finally, the player must press the usual throw button, A / A / A, or L under the stylus controls."
2016-05-28 14:36:54	Chiaki_Nanami	Espyo, do you know how to extract pages of a .pdf document into another .pdf document?
2016-05-28 14:37:14	Chiaki_Nanami	The only way I can do it severely compromises image quality.
2016-05-28 14:46:36	@Espyo	I thought it was one year old yesterday
2016-05-28 14:47:08	@Espyo	the usual...
2016-05-28 14:47:14	@Espyo	if something's wrong, 9 times out of 10 it's the wikia
2016-05-28 14:47:21	Marty2000	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon  JP 28 May 2015
2016-05-28 14:47:21	@Espyo	Chiaki_Nanami: no idea, sorry
2016-05-28 14:47:25	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-05-28 14:47:35	Marty2000	Yes, I should check, to make sure
2016-05-28 14:48:08	@Espyo	but it could be on any article
2016-05-28 14:48:18	@Espyo	the punch article, the controls article, the game's article, the Wii u article
2016-05-28 14:48:24	@Espyo	...the wikia probably doesn't have half of those, though
2016-05-28 14:48:32	Marty2000	Yes... it seems they do not have a Punch article
2016-05-28 14:48:41	Yoshi2	Chiaki_Nanami: open the pdf in chrome and use chrome's print function to specify which page you want, then print as pdf

2016-05-28 14:51:12	Marty2000	Okay, found them
2016-05-28 14:51:20	Marty2000	I'll add how much faster Yellows are
2016-05-28 14:52:00	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-05-28 14:52:18	Marty2000	Oh, and I'll try with Ultra-psicy spray later
2016-05-28 14:52:31	Marty2000	Like what happens for the speed and power, it might change everything
2016-05-28 14:56:25	Marty2000	I also forgot to try with Rock Pikmin...
2016-05-28 14:58:53	Marty2000	I also wonder if the maturity affects that as well
2016-05-28 15:01:50	Yoshi2	apparently there is an online service for splitting pdfs into pages but imo offline solutions are better

2016-05-28 15:04:57	Chiaki_Nanami	It worked!
2016-05-28 15:13:48	Marty2000	Espyo
2016-05-28 15:13:56	Marty2000	I will make other experiments
2016-05-28 15:13:58	Marty2000	But basically
2016-05-28 15:14:08	Marty2000	Maturity has an impact (at least for Yellows)
2016-05-28 15:14:30	Marty2000	And Rocks dig out faster than Red and Purple Pikmin, meaning they're somehow more powerful
2016-05-28 15:14:47	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-28 15:20:23	Marty2000	For example, to gid out a Golden Grenade in the Silver Lake Remix, a flower Yellow Pikmin will need 1 min 9 sec, while a leaf Yellow Pikmin will need 1 min 16 sec
2016-05-28 15:20:29	Marty2000	dig out*
2016-05-28 15:21:56	Marty2000	I don't know if it's the case for P2, by the way
2016-05-28 15:29:48	@Espyo	right
2016-05-28 15:29:58	@Espyo	I think all digging speeds are the same all the time, in P2
2016-05-28 15:30:00	@Espyo	but it's worth checking
2016-05-28 15:30:18	Marty2000	We already know it also depedns on the type of the Pikmin in P2
2016-05-28 15:30:23	Marty2000	depends*
2016-05-28 15:30:48	Marty2000	Maybe it's also different depending on their maturity, but yes, it's worth checking
2016-05-28 15:30:51	@Espyo	I thought that was P3, not P2
2016-05-28 15:30:57	Marty2000	P2 as well
2016-05-28 15:31:02	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-28 15:31:12	Marty2000	Wait, I'm checking the logs
2016-05-28 15:32:22	Marty2000	"===Time taken for a Pikmin to dig up the Paradoxical Enigma=== 2016-05-07 14:35:38	Marty2000	Red = 3 min 9 sec 2016-05-07 14:35:42	Marty2000	White = 4 min 43 sec"
2016-05-28 15:33:05	@Espyo	right
2016-05-28 15:45:39	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlNt6wpxg not sure what to think of this
2016-05-28 15:48:26	Marty2000	Oh, I know this one
2016-05-28 15:48:44	Marty2000	You can walk and access that area with a single captain
2016-05-28 15:49:57	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-05-28 15:50:02	@Espyo	sounds pretty cheap
2016-05-28 15:53:05	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z2a3ibAA hm, this could use some looking-into
2016-05-28 15:53:24	Chiaki_Nanami	Look at the username.

2016-05-28 15:53:54	Marty2000	Espyo: when you are very close to an obstacle, you can't use the "Go here" function
2016-05-28 15:54:17	@Espyo	obstacle as the starting point?
2016-05-28 15:54:30	@Espyo	I know it won't work if you're on a lily pad
2016-05-28 15:54:37	@Espyo	looks like the person who took that was just coming out of the lily pad
2016-05-28 15:54:51	@Espyo	oh, heh, didn't notice the other user's nickname

2016-05-28 17:15:30	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/13/Ancient_Ad_Series-US.jpg Hmm... Normally, the artwork for the green cover is this one http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/7/7d/Thirst-activator-artwork.jpg  I think we should replace the one that was put on the big image
2016-05-28 17:18:41	@Espyo	the big images are an old concept
2016-05-28 17:18:44	@Espyo	we should delete them all
2016-05-28 17:18:46	@Espyo	we already deleted a few
2016-05-28 17:19:04	Marty2000	Oh, I see
2016-05-28 17:45:51	Marty2000	Ok, it's time to get the name of those series in every language. Unfortunately, I will only be able to check for the European version (+ got to restart a save)
2016-05-28 17:46:25	Marty2000	Is there anything I have to check, besides taking screenshots for some articles?
2016-05-28 17:48:22	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-28 17:48:28	@Espyo	not really, I don't think
2016-05-28 17:48:38	@Espyo	but look, that'll require you to go through the game with every language
2016-05-28 17:48:49	@Espyo	since you don't get the series' names until you unlock the final treasure in each
2016-05-28 17:49:02	@Espyo	just leave it to me
2016-05-28 17:49:04	Marty2000	Yes, but I can make savestates and change the language
2016-05-28 17:49:19	@Espyo	one of these days, I'll examine the string files with some scripts
2016-05-28 17:49:24	Marty2000	As you wish
2016-05-28 17:49:27	Marty2000	Thanks then
2016-05-28 17:49:33	@Espyo	and dump all differences between all versions, as well as all foreign titles for stuff that matters
2016-05-28 17:49:42	@Espyo	I might even make it so it automatically adds them to the wiki
2016-05-28 17:49:44	@Espyo	you're welcome
2016-05-28 17:49:48	@Espyo	I think it's better off that way
2016-05-28 17:49:53	@Espyo	a lot less effort involved
2016-05-28 17:50:11	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-28 17:50:51	Marty2000	I still have to restart the game though... some articles on the European treasures need images
2016-05-28 17:51:20	<--	Chiaki_Nanami (Pi@w-1096-05.studat.chalmers.se) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-05-28 17:53:20	@Espyo	right
2016-05-28 18:12:10	--	sleepi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-05-28 18:32:08	@Espyo	so, let me get this straight
2016-05-28 18:32:22	@Espyo	the European version of NPC!P DOES call the Wollywog Wollyhops?
2016-05-28 18:32:30	@Espyo	I mean, on the enemy reel
2016-05-28 18:32:35	@Espyo	I know it does elsewhere
2016-05-28 18:32:35	Marty2000	Yes, it does
2016-05-28 18:32:46	Marty2000	I think I took  screenshots showing that
2016-05-28 18:32:49	Marty2000	[[Wollywog]]
2016-05-28 18:32:50	Testyo	"Wollywog" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Wollywog
2016-05-28 18:32:53	Marty2000	[[Yellow Wollywog]]
2016-05-28 18:32:53	Testyo	"Yellow_Wollywog" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Yellow_Wollywog

2016-05-28 18:32:56	Testyo	"Wogpole" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Wogpole
2016-05-28 18:33:00	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-28 18:33:10	@Espyo	ok, that info needs to be added to the enemy reel article
2016-05-28 18:33:13	@Espyo	I'm editing it, so I'll add it
2016-05-28 18:33:17	Marty2000	Okay :)
2016-05-28 18:34:02	Marty2000	I had deleted an information on that article stating that the creatures were not renamed in the Enemy reel, by the way
2016-05-28 18:34:42	@Espyo	yeah, I think I remember that
2016-05-28 18:34:49	@Espyo	but you never added the fact that they were remained
2016-05-28 18:34:56	@Espyo	so it just looks like we're unaware of any changes
2016-05-28 18:35:23	@Espyo	>As noted above, in the European version of New Play Control! Pikmin 2, the names of the Wollywog, Yellow Wollywog and Wogpole have not been changed to "Wollyhop", "Yellow Wollyhop" and "Wolpole", respectively. 
2016-05-28 18:35:26	@Espyo	oh, you didn't remove this one
2016-05-28 18:35:37	@Espyo	I think I added all of this "no change" thing some years back
2016-05-28 18:35:43	@Espyo	but I could've sworn there were no changes
2016-05-28 18:35:56	@Espyo	I might've seen a video, but I might've thought it was the European version when it was the American one... who knows
2016-05-28 18:35:58	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-28 18:36:08	Marty2000	It's not a problem
2016-05-28 18:37:48	@Espyo	ugh, there's more outdated info here
2016-05-28 18:38:00	@Espyo	I'll take the opportunity to give the article a cleanup
2016-05-28 18:39:06	Marty2000	By the way, I think the name of the [[Pearly Clamclamp]] was also changed
2016-05-28 18:39:06	Testyo	"Pearly_Clamclamp" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pearly_Clamclamp
2016-05-28 18:39:28	Marty2000	Clampshell, yeah
2016-05-28 18:39:31	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-28 18:39:41	Marty2000	Sadly, I haven't taken and won't be able to take a screenshot of it in the enemy reel
2016-05-28 18:39:48	@Espyo	that's all right
2016-05-28 18:39:50	Marty2000	I'll try to find ou Toutube later
2016-05-28 18:39:53	Marty2000	Youtube*
2016-05-28 18:39:57	@Espyo	good luck
2016-05-28 18:40:08	@Espyo	Nintendo keep deleting NPC!P enemy reel videos...
2016-05-28 18:40:10	@Espyo	probably because of the music
2016-05-28 18:40:19	@Espyo	but for some reason, they leave GameCube videos alone
2016-05-28 18:40:30	@Espyo	that's why we use a screenshot for the NPC! version now
2016-05-28 18:40:33	@Espyo	instead of linking to a video
2016-05-28 18:41:44	@Espyo	does this play before or after the credits?
2016-05-28 18:42:33	Marty2000	After the credits
2016-05-28 18:43:12	@Espyo	ok, I'll add that too
2016-05-28 18:43:13	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-28 18:43:18	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-28 19:13:45	Marty2000	Do you think we should add a "See also" section in the articles that lack it? Like http://www.pikminwiki.com/Abstract_Masterpiece
2016-05-28 19:14:45	@Espyo	ideally, all articles would have a See also
2016-05-28 19:14:47	@Espyo	it's part of the policy
2016-05-28 19:14:53	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-28 19:14:58	@Espyo	but for stuff like treasures, that's pretty hard...
2016-05-28 19:15:27	Marty2000	I could add at least a link to their series... or their area
2016-05-28 19:15:34	Marty2000	I dunno what else could be added, though
2016-05-28 19:16:38	@Espyo	I'd say just add links to similar treasures
2016-05-28 19:16:45	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-28 19:16:55	@Espyo	but again, that's kinda tricky because normally, there is already a "this article is about X. for Y, see Z" on the top of the article
2016-05-28 19:16:57	Marty2000	I'll do it later, right now I'm taking screenshots, but thanks ;)
2016-05-28 19:17:01	@Espyo	making the see also section just redundant...
2016-05-28 19:17:17	Marty2000	Ah... yeah, I see what you mean
2016-05-28 19:17:53	Marty2000	Like here... http://www.pikminwiki.com/Essence_of_Desire
2016-05-28 19:18:06	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-28 19:31:45	@Espyo	I moved the digging speeds you got into its own section http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging#Digging_speeds
2016-05-28 19:32:03	@Espyo	but I'm not sure if it could've been done better...
2016-05-28 19:32:18	@Espyo	for one thing, I don't think it'll be that easy to understand
2016-05-28 19:32:25	@Espyo	without having some absolute values, it sucks a bit...
2016-05-28 19:32:45	@Espyo	also for the life of me I cannot figure out if the value I put for the Red/Purple Pikmin is right
2016-05-28 19:32:51	@Espyo	that's the thing about being an engineer
2016-05-28 19:32:53	@Espyo	(at least to me)
2016-05-28 19:32:59	@Espyo	you crunch numbers for breakfast
2016-05-28 19:33:23	Marty2000	I see, he he
2016-05-28 19:33:33	@Espyo	but if somebody tells you "X is 1.5 times faster than Y, and 4 times faster than Z. how many times faster is Y compared to Z?"
2016-05-28 19:33:38	@Espyo	and you're just "uuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."
2016-05-28 19:33:39	Marty2000	I couldn't have precise values, because it changes for every treasure
2016-05-28 19:33:51	@Espyo	(*for every fruit?9
2016-05-28 19:33:52	@Espyo	*)
2016-05-28 19:33:57	Marty2000	Fruit, indeed
2016-05-28 19:34:08	@Espyo	ok, I'll add it on the section that these are rough approximations, then
2016-05-28 19:34:12	Marty2000	I guess it's pretty much the same in P2
2016-05-28 19:34:15	@Espyo	also, what happened to Rock Pikmin?
2016-05-28 19:34:40	Marty2000	Hmm, Rock Pikmin seems to be 1,2 time as fast as Yellows
2016-05-28 19:34:51	Marty2000	But I'll have to verify, I'm really not sure for this one value
2016-05-28 19:35:00	Marty2000	I don't remember times
2016-05-28 19:35:02	@Espyo	they're faster than Yellows? no way
2016-05-28 19:35:04	Marty2000	I'll check later
2016-05-28 19:35:19	Marty2000	Yellows seem to be 1,2 time as fast as Rocks, sorry
2016-05-28 19:35:22	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-28 19:35:33	@Espyo	we'll also need to see maturities and spicy statuses... ugh
2016-05-28 19:35:39	@Espyo	the game files don't say anything, I think
2016-05-28 19:35:44	@Espyo	I think I've searched this before...
2016-05-28 19:42:18	Marty2000	The more I play Pikmin, the more I feel like we haven't discovered half of each game
2016-05-28 19:43:01	Yoshi2	the more you know, the more you know how little you know
2016-05-28 19:43:14	Marty2000	which isn't a bad thing, because I think it's quite rare to still be discovering things on a game 12 years after its release
2016-05-28 19:43:18	Marty2000	Exactly, Yoshi2
2016-05-28 19:44:36	Yoshi2	look at the guy who makes videos about the inner workings of SM64
2016-05-28 19:45:04	Yoshi2	new stuff to be found out about a 20 years old game
2016-05-28 19:45:14	Marty2000	Yeah

2016-05-28 20:10:43	Marty2000	Even thought it's the same treasure, the image shows the American version of that treasure, having a different name
2016-05-28 20:10:55	Marty2000	I think we should take a screenshot of the treasure with its European one
2016-05-28 20:12:17	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-28 20:19:29	Marty2000	Oh, interesting... I forgot to say something... You probably know that no Ivory Candypop Bud appear in any other cave if you haven't unlocked Whites using those found in the White Flower Garden... the exception is the Subterranena Complex... using hacks, you can find Ivory Candypop Buds thereeven if Whites aren't unlocked yet

2016-05-28 20:19:54	@Espyo	I think you might've said that

2016-05-28 20:20:25	Marty2000	Okay, I wasn't sure
2016-05-28 20:20:36	Marty2000	I'm checking old screenshots, before deleting them...

2016-05-28 21:09:26	Lord_Juffowup	I want to add a gif of a treasure popping out of a creature when it dies
2016-05-28 21:09:33	@Espyo	when we're trying to show off a mechanic that has animations and moving stuff, a gif is great
2016-05-28 21:09:45	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-28 21:09:52	@Espyo	if you do that, I'd recommend doing that for a big treasure
2016-05-28 21:10:00	@Espyo	because if it's a small one, it'll be hard to tell what trajectory it takes when it comes out
2016-05-28 21:10:12	@Espyo	so if we're going to have an animation showing what happens, it's better if it shows really clearly
2016-05-28 21:10:21	@Espyo	and I think a big treasure inside a medium enemy would work great
2016-05-28 21:10:31	Yoshi2	the wiki should totally have support for webm
2016-05-28 21:10:47	@Espyo	I could ask Porple, but honestly, how many people in the world know how to make a webm?
2016-05-28 21:10:50	@Espyo	like zero
2016-05-28 21:11:42	Yoshi2	webms could probably be made with any decent video editing program
2016-05-28 21:12:01	@Espyo	not sure if most users even have one of those
2016-05-28 21:12:10	@Espyo	kinda ties in with what we talked about yesterday with movie maker and all
2016-05-28 21:12:18	@Espyo	plus, I'm not sure if all browsers support webm
2016-05-28 21:12:38	@Espyo	AND if having a webm on a page is as convenient and neatly-framed as a gif or image
2016-05-28 21:13:01	@Espyo	it could work, but if it ends up being something almost nobody uses, and it just creates awkward videos on the page, I don't think it's a good idea
2016-05-28 21:13:12	@Espyo	having animations on an article is good for the reader to see them as they read
2016-05-28 21:13:30	@Espyo	if the reader has to go out of their way to like click on the video just to open a page where they can actually see it, then it's no better than linking to a youtube video
2016-05-28 21:13:40	@Espyo	but hey, if everything works out all right, I'd prefer webms
2016-05-28 21:13:46	@Espyo	since they're normally a million times smaller than gifs

2016-05-29 13:40:04	Marty2000	I've already watched that one, though, but it's cool too! I might try to do such things, sometime
2016-05-29 13:40:27	@Espyo	it's really fun
2016-05-29 13:40:28	@Espyo	try it
2016-05-29 13:40:31	@Espyo	oh, and do record it!
2016-05-29 13:41:02	Marty2000	Yes! I've never tried recording with DOlphin for the moment, but I really want to try
2016-05-29 13:42:08	@Espyo	well, it worked instantly well when I recorded that Pellet Posy video
2016-05-29 13:42:15	@Espyo	and even back on windows it wasn't hard at all
2016-05-29 13:42:26	@Espyo	but you'll definitely want to be on one of the most recent versions of Dolphin
2016-05-29 13:43:37	Marty2000	I'm on 4.0.2, I think
2016-05-29 13:48:49	@Espyo	I think that'll work fine
2016-05-29 13:48:59	@Espyo	there should be a "Movie" option on the menu
2016-05-29 13:49:09	@Espyo	from there, tick both the frame dump and audio dump options
2016-05-29 13:49:20	@Espyo	you may want to do this when the game is paused, so it starts recording both video and audio at the same time
2016-05-29 13:49:27	@Espyo	same for stopping a recording
2016-05-29 13:49:29	@Espyo	and it should just work
2016-05-29 13:50:11	Marty2000	I see, thanks
2016-05-29 13:54:56	Yoshi2	Espyo: how does it feel to have 1k-2k subscribers?
2016-05-29 13:54:56	Testyo	-2 K = -275.15 °C / -463.27 °F
2016-05-29 13:55:05	@Espyo	it just happened
2016-05-29 13:55:15	@Espyo	I honestly don't know what to feel
2016-05-29 13:55:23	@Espyo	and like, my channel isn't about any specific content
2016-05-29 13:55:34	@Espyo	I just upload whatever
2016-05-29 13:55:42	@Espyo	so actually, it doesn't make much sense for a person to subscribe to me
2016-05-29 13:55:51	@Espyo	they could've subbed because I uploaded one or two Sonic Adventure videos
2016-05-29 13:56:00	@Espyo	and I'll probably never upload another SA video again
2016-05-29 13:56:09	Yoshi2	I know two or three other guys who have a thousand subscribers and I wonder what I'm doing wrong
2016-05-29 13:56:36	Marty2000	Oh, so you have Sonic videos? I haven't really checked all your videos, but I'm going to do so
2016-05-29 13:57:14	@Espyo	I have like 200 videos
2016-05-29 13:57:17	@Espyo	it's insane to think about it
2016-05-29 13:57:29	@Espyo	I just upload, without caring much about numbers
2016-05-29 13:57:35	@Espyo	and then when I notice, it's just at these stats
2016-05-29 13:57:48	@Espyo	actually, sometimes I DO care about stats
2016-05-29 13:57:57	@Espyo	when I made Smash videos, I wanted them to get a good number of views
2016-05-29 13:58:04	@Espyo	because making them was VERY hard
2016-05-29 13:58:10	@Espyo	in fact, I stopped making them for Smash 4 because of tha
2016-05-29 13:58:11	@Espyo	*t
2016-05-29 13:58:32	Marty2000	Oh, you even have Sonic Heroes
2016-05-29 13:58:34	@Espyo	it takes so much time to do them, it's so error-prone, it never ends up being just the quality I want it to, and in the end, only like 100 people see it
2016-05-29 13:58:36	Marty2000	great
2016-05-29 13:58:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-29 13:58:45	Yoshi2	I have 58 videos :|
2016-05-29 13:59:13	Yoshi2	maybe I should upload random gameplay stuff
2016-05-29 13:59:29	@Espyo	I wouldn't recommend it
2016-05-29 13:59:39	@Espyo	just upload what you like and what you feel is needed on the internet
2016-05-29 13:59:43	@Espyo	basically, focus on being interesting
2016-05-29 13:59:51	@Espyo	that's what all my videos have in common, if I can say that much
2016-05-29 14:00:01	@Espyo	if the videos are interesting, and people find them interesting, they'll come
2016-05-29 14:00:12	Yoshi2	I do have quite a few ideas for BW videos
2016-05-29 14:00:15	Yoshi2	the only issue is
2016-05-29 14:00:17	@Espyo	if it's just Let's Play Channel #55122246, nobody will really flock
2016-05-29 14:00:17	Yoshi2	it's BW
2016-05-29 14:00:25	@Espyo	yeah, I get you...
2016-05-29 14:02:37	Marty2000	Have you ever tried hacking Sonic Heroes? Well, I mean, replacing the characters' models or animations (on the PC version)
2016-05-29 14:03:37	@Espyo	there was a trainer for it
2016-05-29 14:03:39	@Espyo	that's the most I've ever done
2016-05-29 14:03:57	@Espyo	it allowed you to change the models' sizes, super jump, super speed, infinite rings...
2016-05-29 14:03:59	@Espyo	it was really fun
2016-05-29 14:04:06	Marty2000	Oh yes, I have it
2016-05-29 14:04:15	@Espyo	but I never made any videos about it since everybody knows that trainer already
2016-05-29 14:05:13	Marty2000	The tool to replace the animations is called "charrepper", if you know it
2016-05-29 14:07:29	@Espyo	oh, I didn't
2016-05-29 14:07:33	@Espyo	doesn't even ring a bell
2016-05-29 14:07:42	Marty2000	Hmm, I remember there was a version of that tool where you needed to download TXD Workshop and open the TXD file of the character once you had finished changing what you wanted
2016-05-29 14:07:47	Marty2000	Otherwise the game would crash
2016-05-29 14:07:56	Marty2000	It's still the case, probably
2016-05-29 14:08:01	@Espyo	messing with Sonic Heroes's files isn't really the easiest thing in the world...
2016-05-29 14:08:02	Marty2000	I still have the old version
2016-05-29 14:08:16	@Espyo	back in the Sonic Robo Blast 2 days, I tried making levels based on Sonic Heroes
2016-05-29 14:08:21	@Espyo	and it was a nightmare to get the textures
2016-05-29 14:08:29	Marty2000	I see what you mean
2016-05-29 14:08:42	@Espyo	mostly because TXD Workshop is THE tool for the job... but it was made for the GTA games, so it doesn't work well with SH
2016-05-29 14:08:54	@Espyo	crazy times
2016-05-29 14:09:03	Marty2000	Hmm, replacing the animations is easy most of the time, as long as you don't do really weird stuff
2016-05-29 14:09:20	@Espyo	yeah, I'm watching this video
2016-05-29 14:09:22	@Espyo	seems easy enough
2016-05-29 14:09:32	Marty2000	The exception being Tails
2016-05-29 14:09:49	Marty2000	You can have him as a SPEED character, but he will lose his... tails
2016-05-29 14:09:52	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-29 14:10:31	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-29 14:13:39	Marty2000	If you want to try hacking Sonic Heroes sometime, though, I recommend that you copy the original files somewhere
2016-05-29 14:13:59	Marty2000	Because it's easy to mess the game and have to reinstall it then because of that
2016-05-29 14:14:03	@Espyo	oh, I bet
2016-05-29 14:14:09	@Espyo	I can't remember, but I'm sure I've had to do that before
2016-05-29 14:14:13	@Espyo	oh well :|
2016-05-29 14:14:49	Marty2000	Only the anm / dff / txd files should be enough
2016-05-29 14:15:46	Marty2000	In DVD Root / Playmodel, I think that's where they are
2016-05-29 14:16:21	@Espyo	that sounds familiar, yeah
2016-05-29 14:32:12	Yoshi2	oh god i am SO proud of this: http://i.imgur.com/2Jn905M.png
2016-05-29 14:32:37	Yoshi2	even though I decided to take the easy route and instead of adding text fields for every attribute, I just dumped the xml text into an editor for the user to edit
2016-05-29 14:33:10	Yoshi2	press save xml and the changes from the text editor will be incorporated into the structure again
2016-05-29 14:49:54	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-05-29 14:49:58	@Espyo	yeah, that is the easy route for sure
2016-05-29 14:50:07	@Espyo	but hey, if it works, and if it's not too much of a bother for the user, who cares!
2016-05-29 14:50:48	Yoshi2	I think it is the best and most flexible route
2016-05-29 14:51:17	Yoshi2	because some of the xml objects have a loooot of attributes
2016-05-29 14:52:04	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-29 14:53:02	Yoshi2	there might be ways to do it better but those require more work than I can be arsed to do
2016-05-29 14:53:27	@Espyo	I was thinking the same
2016-05-29 14:53:35	@Espyo	there are so many combinations of values and attributes and all
2016-05-29 14:53:44	@Espyo	that you'd have to go around using a couple of heavy patterns and such
2016-05-29 14:53:47	@Espyo	bleh, nuts to that
2016-05-29 15:09:58	Marty2000	I'm surprised... I thought Rock Pikmin were more powerful only when they are thrown... actually, even when they lacth onto something (Burgeoning Spiderwort, for example), they're still more powerful than Red or Purple Pikmin, for instance.
2016-05-29 15:15:43	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-29 15:15:51	Marty2000	Want values?
2016-05-29 15:16:06	Marty2000	Look at that
2016-05-29 15:16:33	Marty2000	Number of hits taken for each Pikmin to make a berry fall off the plant:
2016-05-29 15:16:41	Marty2000	20 for Reds and Purples
2016-05-29 15:16:48	Marty2000	30 for Blues and Yellows
2016-05-29 15:16:56	Marty2000	60 for Winged and White Pikmin
2016-05-29 15:17:03	Marty2000	15 for Rock Pikmin
2016-05-29 15:17:05	@Espyo	it probably matches the "regular" attack property value
2016-05-29 15:17:11	@Espyo	[[Rock Pikmin]]
2016-05-29 15:17:11	Testyo	"Rock_Pikmin" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Rock_Pikmin
2016-05-29 15:17:12	Marty2000	Probably
2016-05-29 15:17:15	@Espyo	[[Red Pikmin]]
2016-05-29 15:17:15	Testyo	"Red_Pikmin" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Red_Pikmin
2016-05-29 15:17:27	@Espyo	>20 on lunge
2016-05-29 15:17:33	@Espyo	seems about right, then
2016-05-29 15:17:56	Marty2000	I thought they would be as powerful as Blues or Yellows when latching onto something, to be honest
2016-05-29 15:19:13	@Espyo	same
2016-05-29 15:22:31	Marty2000	Oh, I found a glitch, probably: how to have a Pikmin drink nectar without evolving, in P3...
2016-05-29 15:22:35	Marty2000	I'll try to record it
2016-05-29 15:24:20	Marty2000	Recorded
2016-05-29 15:24:24	Marty2000	That's a harmful one
2016-05-29 15:30:08	@Espyo	woah
2016-05-29 15:30:35	Marty2000	And unfortunately, it's easy to reproduce it
2016-05-29 15:30:38	Marty2000	even accidently :/
2016-05-29 15:31:51	@Espyo	I've heard of it, but never got it to happen
2016-05-29 15:32:03	@Espyo	what, do you whistle the Pikmin just as it touches the nectar?
2016-05-29 15:32:12	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-29 15:40:37	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/ohKR1cw1XSc
2016-05-29 15:47:06	@Espyo	yikrd
2016-05-29 15:47:08	@Espyo	*yikes
2016-05-29 15:47:21	@Espyo	looks like all that's needed is to have the Pikmin inside the whistle effect
2016-05-29 15:47:34	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-29 15:48:00	Marty2000	I've got something else to show you... please wait for the video to be uploaded
2016-05-29 15:48:06	Marty2000	It's not a glitch (probably)
2016-05-29 15:48:10	Marty2000	But it's cool
2016-05-29 15:48:17	Marty2000	Or strange, depends
2016-05-29 15:51:54	@Espyo	ooh
2016-05-29 15:52:13	Marty2000	It's here soon, but I can explain now
2016-05-29 15:52:24	Marty2000	since it's even hard to understand with a video
2016-05-29 15:52:44	Marty2000	because the Pikmin series is basically hard to understand :p
2016-05-29 16:02:12	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-29 16:02:59	Marty2000	So... https://youtu.be/W6DWENeU_Ow
2016-05-29 16:03:28	Marty2000	If you have two Pikmin of the same type, you can still swap them, like you would do if you had two Pikmin of different types
2016-05-29 16:03:37	Marty2000	In P3
2016-05-29 16:03:40	Marty2000	(only)
2016-05-29 16:04:01	Marty2000	You can see better if they have a different maturity
2016-05-29 16:05:38	Marty2000	But the way it works is really weird: let's say you have a flower Purple Pikmin and a leaf one. If you throw the leaf one, then hold it, you can swap it for the flower Pikmin, but the contrary is not possible.
2016-05-29 16:06:09	Marty2000	If you really want the contrary to be possible, then throw the flower Pikmin, and hold it: you will be able to swap it for the leaf Pikmin. 
2016-05-29 16:06:48	Marty2000	To keep it short, the last Pikmin thrown is the one you can swap
2016-05-29 16:09:55	@Espyo	wow...
2016-05-29 16:11:08	Marty2000	(only when they are of the same type, of course)
2016-05-29 16:20:39	Testyo	I haven't done anything was incredibly easy
2016-05-29 16:27:49	Yoshi2	time spent figuring out how the hell I am supposed to use postgres for this homework: 1-2 hours
2016-05-29 16:27:57	Yoshi2	time spent doing homework: not started yet
2016-05-29 16:28:06	Yoshi2	:|
2016-05-29 16:28:31	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-29 16:29:45	Yoshi2	sqlite was easier than this
2016-05-29 16:51:36	Yoshi2	well, I think I got it now
2016-05-29 17:26:08	Yoshi2	to be fair I probably could've done this in sqlite
2016-05-29 17:26:46	Yoshi2	but when the homework asks that it should work in postgres, I'll test that for the extra safety
2016-05-29 17:27:11	@Espyo	postgres?
2016-05-29 17:28:00	Yoshi2	postgresql
2016-05-29 17:28:14	@Espyo	oh

2016-05-29 21:34:26	@Espyo	I decided to play some Ranked today for the first time in months
2016-05-29 21:34:37	@Espyo	went from A- 30 to A+ 72
2016-05-29 21:34:40	@Espyo	losing only ONE match
2016-05-29 21:35:16	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-29 21:35:18	Marty2000	Great
2016-05-29 21:35:35	Marty2000	What's your favorite mode in Ranked?
2016-05-29 21:35:35	@Espyo	either I'm super lucky, super good, or the Tri-Slosher is too good for this map rotation
2016-05-29 21:35:42	Marty2000	I probably prefer Rainmaker
2016-05-29 21:35:50	Marty2000	Oh, you know, it's really random in this mode
2016-05-29 21:35:56	@Espyo	(Tower Control, Flounder Heights, Ancho-V Games)
2016-05-29 21:36:07	@Espyo	honestly, I haven't played enough Ranked to decide on a favorite mode
2016-05-29 21:36:09	@Espyo	I like all of them
2016-05-29 21:36:11	@Espyo	same thing with the stages, really
2016-05-29 21:36:17	@Espyo	I hear so many people complain about this or that stage
2016-05-29 21:36:20	@Espyo	I think they're all very well done
2016-05-29 21:36:25	Marty2000	As an example, once, I went from S+ to A and I was playing as I always do
2016-05-29 21:36:31	@Espyo	ouch
2016-05-29 21:36:47	Marty2000	Oh, I also like each mode, despite having problems with Tower Control (particularly in Camp Triggerfish)
2016-05-29 21:36:51	@Espyo	wait, I thought that after you reached S+, you remained locked on it
2016-05-29 21:36:52	Marty2000	I'm just better at Rainmaker
2016-05-29 21:37:01	Marty2000	No
2016-05-29 21:37:10	@Espyo	did they change that, or was I fed lies?
2016-05-29 21:37:14	Marty2000	However, if you're S or S+, you do not lose points in squads
2016-05-29 21:37:20	Marty2000	I'm afraid it's the latter
2016-05-29 21:38:10	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-29 21:38:18	@Espyo	that's probably what I was told, then
2016-05-29 21:38:23	@Espyo	and I just thought it was a global "lock"
2016-05-29 21:38:33	Marty2000	What can be frustrating in Ranked is that you can take weeks to earn a rank, and take minutes to lose it
2016-05-29 21:38:49	Marty2000	Ah last thing
2016-05-29 21:38:58	Marty2000	You can only rank up to A+99 in squads
2016-05-29 21:39:03	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-29 21:39:08	@Espyo	oh, I think I knew that
2016-05-29 21:39:09	Marty2000	You will have to win the single point alone to rank up to S
2016-05-29 21:39:16	Marty2000	Okay, good then :)
2016-05-29 21:42:43	Marty2000	I see you and Jake are playing
2016-05-29 21:43:12	Marty2000	I will join if you don't mind. I want to try new weapons... Ah, by the way, still looking for Quick Respawn abilities?
2016-05-29 21:43:26	Marty2000	If I recall, I got something very interesting recently

2016-05-30 15:28:24	Yoshi2	Marty2000: are you interested in decompiling gamecube games
2016-05-30 15:33:42	Marty2000	Hmm... I don't know honestly (limited knowledge). Why?
2016-05-30 15:34:27	Yoshi2	somebody in the tcrf chat posted the link to a decompiler that can also decompile powerpc into c code, and it is pretty dope
2016-05-30 15:35:08	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-30 15:35:13	Marty2000	Why not, then
2016-05-30 15:38:56	Yoshi2	but it's an online service and there is a limit on how much time it will spend decompiling
2016-05-30 15:39:49	Yoshi2	https://retdec.com
2016-05-30 15:40:03	Yoshi2	plus, it cannot take .dol files, only .elf files
2016-05-30 15:40:15	Marty2000	I see. Thanks!
2016-05-30 15:40:28	Yoshi2	(but there are ways to convert .dol into .elf)
2016-05-30 15:40:47	Marty2000	I'll check later, I'm opening your link in a new tab
2016-05-30 15:42:52	Yoshi2	and technically you probably aren't authorized to decompile a game you didn't make yourself yadda yadda
2016-05-30 15:42:55	Yoshi2	but who caaaares
2016-05-30 15:43:04	Marty2000	Yeah, ha ha
2016-05-30 15:44:05	Marty2000	Honestly, with what we've been doing since we know hacking... I'd say why not continue :p
2016-05-30 16:00:14	Yoshi2	later this week I will try to decompile the complete game executable by doing it in chunks, then merging the chunks together
2016-05-30 16:01:09	Yoshi2	and maybe do the same to pikmin 2
2016-05-30 16:01:30	Yoshi2	and then I can give the results to others who are interested
2016-05-30 16:04:08	Marty2000	Great
2016-05-30 16:05:06	Yoshi2	pretty interesting that AVG seems to be behind this decompiler
2016-05-30 17:10:19	Yoshi2	scratch "later this week"
2016-05-30 17:10:22	Yoshi2	doing this NOW
2016-05-30 18:42:32	Yoshi2	ok, I think I finished
2016-05-30 18:46:35	Marty2000	Good
2016-05-30 18:46:58	Yoshi2	all in all
2016-05-30 18:47:04	Yoshi2	this is not perfect
2016-05-30 18:47:10	Yoshi2	but great as a reference point
2016-05-30 18:49:57	Yoshi2	and far better than only having the raw assembler code that dolphin generates

2016-05-30 20:12:44	Marty2000	Yes, Klemen702
2016-05-30 20:15:26	Klemen702	this isn't for homework/tests or anything. i'm just curious but...
2016-05-30 20:15:43	Klemen702	potentional energy is for an object that isn't moving?
2016-05-30 20:15:51	Klemen702	and kinetic for the energy you put in the object
2016-05-30 20:15:53	Klemen702	like throwing a rock
2016-05-30 20:19:08	Marty2000	I think that potential energy is when you "give" energy to something without touching it
2016-05-30 20:19:26	Marty2000	For example, gravitational energy
2016-05-30 20:19:49	Klemen702	ah
2016-05-30 20:19:50	Klemen702	like uh
2016-05-30 20:19:53	Klemen702	falling?
2016-05-30 20:20:27	Marty2000	Yes, because you interact with Earth
2016-05-30 20:20:46	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy
2016-05-30 20:20:47	Klemen702	ah right
2016-05-30 20:20:56	Klemen702	i had that falling part on my mind
2016-05-30 20:21:16	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-30 20:21:43	Klemen702	did i get kinetic correct
2016-05-30 20:21:45	Klemen702	or do u not know
2016-05-30 20:22:15	Yoshi2	kinetic energy is the energy a moving object has
2016-05-30 20:22:26	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-30 20:22:35	Marty2000	You transfer energy to another one
2016-05-30 20:22:42	Klemen702	oki

2016-05-30 20:31:15	Yoshi2	I'm sure you wanted to tell him about

2016-05-30 21:11:40	Yoshi2	I'll probably do it just for the BMS stuff
2016-05-30 21:11:46	@Espyo	I'd love that, but it'll be hell to read it
2016-05-30 21:11:54	@Espyo	give the BMS part a try
2016-05-30 21:11:59	@Espyo	and then I guess we can go on from there
2016-05-30 21:12:07	Yoshi2	better than reading plain assembly
2016-05-30 21:12:31	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-30 21:12:58	Yoshi2	according to the rules on the site you should only decompile stuff you have the permission for but

2016-05-30 21:13:28	@Espyo	well, we don't have Nintendo's permission
2016-05-30 21:13:36	@Espyo	but we also don't have an explicit prohibition
2016-05-30 21:13:41	Yoshi2	heh
2016-05-30 21:13:45	@Espyo	which makes it an implied explicit permission
2016-05-30 21:13:59	Yoshi2	and tbh nintendo asked for it
2016-05-30 21:14:12	Yoshi2	(ok, horrible reason but BMS is really weird)
2016-05-30 21:15:15	@Espyo	they'll probably even thank you for making the BMS format readable
2016-05-30 21:15:22	@Espyo	even they are probably dying to understand it
2016-05-30 21:15:29	@Espyo	they since moved on, but what if they want to come back to it?
2016-05-30 21:15:43	@Espyo	their documentation is probably as good as a comment saying "Abandon all hope ye who enter."
2016-05-30 21:16:01	@Espyo	granted, that's one line of code that has to be inside ALL projects with more than 30 files of code
2016-05-30 21:17:11	Yoshi2	the decompiled C code is 10-20 MB
2016-05-30 21:17:17	Yoshi2	definitely abandon all hope
2016-05-30 21:18:55	@Espyo	of the full game?
2016-05-30 21:19:51	Yoshi2	yes
2016-05-30 21:20:03	Yoshi2	unoptimized C code, but still quite a bit
2016-05-30 21:22:41	Yoshi2	...........hmmm I'm always way too optimistic with this stuff
2016-05-30 21:23:08	Yoshi2	10 MB of code is a LOT of code
2016-05-30 21:25:30	Yoshi2	30 MB, even
2016-05-30 21:25:48	Yoshi2	must be a good 500k-1000k lines of code
2016-05-30 21:25:48	Testyo	-1000 K = -1273.15 °C / -2259.67 °F
2016-05-30 21:25:51	Yoshi2	:|||
2016-05-30 21:27:03	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-30 21:27:14	@Espyo	can you even find anything in that?
2016-05-30 21:27:21	@Espyo	and is it all in one file?
2016-05-30 21:28:12	Yoshi2	I had to do the decompilation in chunks because of the time limit, so it's several files
2016-05-30 21:28:54	Yoshi2	there are strings I can find
2016-05-30 21:29:11	@Espyo	oh, that probably helps
2016-05-30 21:29:38	@Espyo	are the variables, functions, etc. called something significant, or like Function1At0x00571be7() ?
2016-05-30 21:30:57	Yoshi2	int32_t function_80052ca8(int32_t a1, int32_t a2, int32_t a3);
2016-05-30 21:31:24	@Espyo	yyyyyyyyyyyep
2016-05-30 21:31:46	@Espyo	I've got a lot of questions, but it might be better if you send me an excerpt 
2016-05-30 21:31:47	@Espyo	if you can
2016-05-30 21:31:55	@Espyo	like some 500 KB of it or something

2016-05-30 21:33:18	Yoshi2	still fine, or do you want pikmin?
2016-05-30 21:33:43	@Espyo	still fine
2016-05-30 21:33:49	@Espyo	right now, I just want to see how readable it is or isn't
2016-05-30 21:34:00	@Espyo	and you know, just get a general feel
2016-05-30 21:34:09	@Espyo	I won't be able to understand what's going on, anyway
2016-05-30 21:34:18	@Espyo	so it won't matter to me if it's BW or Pikmin :P
2016-05-30 21:36:17	Marty2000	Hmm, Espyo... you know, the Shaggy Longs Legs has an artic variation...
2016-05-30 21:36:52	Marty2000	I'm wondering if the Medusal Slurker could have one... take a look at this:

2016-05-30 21:44:48	@J	beautiful
2016-05-30 21:45:51	Yoshi2	it does show the structs, which is awesome
2016-05-30 21:46:01	Yoshi2	you can probably guess some stuff by the struct types
2016-05-30 21:46:59	@J	or just run away crying
2016-05-30 21:47:05	Yoshi2	the decompiler has varying levels of optimization, I wonder how much I'd gain by increasing the optimizations
2016-05-30 21:47:20	Yoshi2	J: that's also an option
2016-05-30 21:47:55	Yoshi2	it is a bit saddening that even with a working decompiler it is still

2016-05-30 22:03:45	@Espyo	looks like it's just the lighting tricking us, to be honest
2016-05-30 22:04:00	@Espyo	plus the color behind it (dirt vs stones)
2016-05-30 22:04:00	Marty2000	I see, thanks then.

2016-05-30 22:04:56	@PikFan	different texture for the Medusal Slurker?
2016-05-30 22:05:18	Yoshi2	I think in combination with some other tools/techniques to find a specific feature you are looking for, the decompiled code could be very useful
2016-05-30 22:05:48	Marty2000	PikFan, I thought that
2016-05-30 22:05:52	Marty2000	like the Shaggy Long Legs,
2016-05-30 22:06:02	Marty2000	The Medusal Slurker could have an artic vertion

2016-05-30 22:08:29	@PikFan	well, it's good to explore uncertainties

2016-05-30 22:09:22	@PikFan	I've got a couple of things to say about treasures

2016-05-30 22:12:05	@PikFan	...oh, it's already on there
2016-05-30 22:12:08	@PikFan	"All treasures in the overworld areas emit a faint oscillating sound, not unlike the ambient noises heard in caves. They only emit this sound while they are not being carried by Pikmin."
2016-05-30 22:12:29	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-30 22:12:38	@PikFan	yeah, when you get close to the treasures in the overworld, they start making a low buzzing sound
2016-05-30 22:13:18	@PikFan	actually, there was something else
2016-05-30 22:13:28	@PikFan	>not unlike the ambient noises heard in caves.

2016-05-30 22:19:04	@PikFan	fun
2016-05-30 22:19:16	@PikFan	is it more complicated than figuring out Pikmin 2's nonsense
2016-05-30 22:19:29	@Espyo	probably not

2016-05-30 23:11:47	Marty2000	I don't think it's temporary, it's in a thread on how to make webm's
2016-05-30 23:11:57	Marty2000	Well, thanks fro replying, anyway

2016-05-30 23:14:15	Marty2000	It has been submitted. I don't really go on Reddit, does it need approving before it can be seen?
2016-05-30 23:15:18	@Espyo	nope, it's done
2016-05-30 23:15:29	@Espyo	I'll post a comment to give it some attention
2016-05-30 23:15:31	@Espyo	but I won't post it yet
2016-05-30 23:15:36	@Espyo	see, it's simple... but it's also complicated
2016-05-30 23:15:57	@Espyo	because most people are subscribed to a lot of different subreddits, they'll have a LOT of content going there way
2016-05-30 23:16:08	@Espyo	so reddit itself filters the content people see, putting the most popular things first
2016-05-30 23:16:16	Marty2000	Ah, okay
2016-05-30 23:16:24	@Espyo	otherwise, most people would see some random person's crappy drawing instead of that awesome screenshot everybody's talking about
2016-05-30 23:16:30	@Espyo	so to get something seen, it helps if it's popular
2016-05-30 23:16:48	@Espyo	I'd do it right now, but I'm afraid it'll think we're like working in cahoots
2016-05-30 23:16:59	@Espyo	of course, you don't need to overthink this
2016-05-30 23:17:03	@Espyo	and not every post should be popular
2016-05-30 23:17:12	@Espyo	but reddit is a fun place with awesome people liking awesome stuff
2016-05-30 23:17:17	Marty2000	I don't post for popularity, anyway
2016-05-30 23:17:18	@Espyo	...but also a place with horrible people being horrible
2016-05-30 23:17:24	Marty2000	I see...
2016-05-30 23:17:28	@Espyo	if some jackass decides to start down-voting your post
2016-05-30 23:17:30	@Espyo	for no reason
2016-05-30 23:17:35	@Espyo	it'll get buried beyond recognition
2016-05-30 23:17:43	@Espyo	that doesn't really happen on something like /r/splatoon, thankfully
2016-05-30 23:17:45	@Espyo	but still
2016-05-30 23:17:58	@Espyo	I'm tired of seeing a million "I've finally reached S rank!" posts on /r/splatoon

2016-05-30 23:18:08	@Espyo	it won't hurt to bring some fresh videos to the front page to combat that
2016-05-30 23:18:34	Marty2000	I see what you mean with the "S rank" thing,he he
2016-05-30 23:19:01	@Espyo	it's so annoying... ugh
2016-05-30 23:19:11	@Espyo	we get it, you ranked up, like a million people
2016-05-30 23:19:13	@Espyo	it's not that special
2016-05-30 23:19:18	@Espyo	not even S+ is that special, much less S
2016-05-30 23:19:24	Marty2000	I used to go on a forum whee millions of people would post that too
2016-05-30 23:20:03	@Espyo	ugh
2016-05-30 23:20:04	Marty2000	Of course, I think they can share whatever they want, but on the other hand... nobody will pay a lot of attention to such a common thing
2016-05-30 23:20:38	Marty2000	Or interesting stuff will get drown on those posts too

2016-05-30 23:50:45	@Espyo	maybe it purposely filters out new users?
2016-05-30 23:50:50	@Espyo	to avoid spammers
2016-05-30 23:50:58	Marty2000	Maybe...
2016-05-30 23:50:59	@Espyo	well, like I said, a comment will probably help
2016-05-30 23:51:38	Marty2000	Thanks. That's a funny idea, I think I have tons of little things to share like that, I usually record all my matches

2016-05-31 16:35:17	Marty2000	Hi PikFan
2016-05-31 16:35:21	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-05-31 16:35:37	@PikFan	but I'm just tired of constantly being attacked
2016-05-31 16:35:44	@PikFan	I wish we could agree to disagree
2016-05-31 16:35:49	@PikFan	hi Marty2000
2016-05-31 16:37:24	Yoshi2	politics on the internet is a fest of flinging shit at each other if you happen to have the wrong opinion
2016-05-31 16:37:36	@PikFan	yyyyyyyyyyyyup
2016-05-31 16:37:40	@PikFan	in real life, too
2016-05-31 16:38:17	Marty2000	I really don't like when people feel the need to criticize others' opinions. Why can't they accept different opinions? So narrow-minded
2016-05-31 16:38:43	Yoshi2	Marty2000: debating stuff can be pretty cool

2016-05-31 16:39:10	@PikFan	sadly, not many share your mindset :(
2016-05-31 16:39:22	@PikFan	they feel the need to shove their views on others
2016-05-31 16:39:23	Yoshi2	it's just that debating rarely changes the opinion of the ones involved
2016-05-31 16:39:51	Marty2000	Yes, but people tend to criticize opinions and say "you shouldn't...  or that's bad" and I don't really like that
2016-05-31 16:40:03	Marty2000	Also, people judging without knowing one's motivations 
2016-05-31 16:40:07	@PikFan	or, in my case, "You're a racist!"

2016-05-31 16:42:54	@PikFan	Firefox wasn't displaying my text very quickly
2016-05-31 16:44:12	@PikFan	by the way, just so you know, I'll be leaving earlier than usual
2016-05-31 16:44:22	Marty2000	Anyway, you can have your opinion and disagree with someone, but you shouldn't impose your opinions, that's what I meant
2016-05-31 16:44:24	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-31 16:44:25	@PikFan	a class is coming to the library so I'll have to get off
2016-05-31 16:44:30	@PikFan	right, right
2016-05-31 16:45:15	@PikFan	someone was saying that supporters of a presidential candidate were stupid
2016-05-31 16:45:21	Yoshi2	Marty2000: in some cases you can expect a response though
2016-05-31 16:45:35	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-31 16:45:42	@PikFan	so, I said, "You can't make generalizations just because some of their supporters are bigots."
2016-05-31 16:45:48	@PikFan	...my comment was deleted
2016-05-31 16:46:12	@PikFan	then I privately messaged them, asking why they were disrespecting me
2016-05-31 16:46:27	@PikFan	they said they weren't, and asked me what my problem was
2016-05-31 16:46:40	@PikFan	so I told them what my problem was, still in a civil manner
2016-05-31 16:46:45	@PikFan	...and then I was unfriended
2016-05-31 16:47:06	@PikFan	just shows how two-faced some people really are :|

2016-05-31 16:49:30	@PikFan	people act like they're all nice

2016-05-31 16:58:48	Scruffy	Specifically the articles about canon subjects
2016-05-31 16:59:02	@PikFan	hehe, yeah
2016-05-31 16:59:20	Scruffy	I was wondering, do we need Olimar and Louie's notes on everything?
2016-05-31 16:59:23	@PikFan	I saw your Impact Site edit

2016-05-31 16:59:44	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-31 17:00:32	@PikFan	I think the canon notes can be done away with, yeah

2016-05-31 17:01:12	Scruffy	I can get started on that then
2016-05-31 17:01:38	@PikFan	they probably have more transcription errors, too, since they were c/p'd from Pikipedia a loooooong time ago

2016-05-31 18:22:42	Marty2000	"Because it's because..." by UltraMario.
2016-05-31 18:23:06	Yoshi2	I've never met a person who thought that sweets are too strong, so I wonder what it means for sweets to be too strong
2016-05-31 18:23:20	Yoshi2	I have met people who avoid sweets due to health reasons
2016-05-31 18:28:11	Scruffy	Klemen702, you might enjoy the raindrop cake http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hyK2azXLUWR65D6bsK03JDj0uJM=/fit-in/1200x9600/2016%2F04%2F06%2F99%2F4_Raindrop.db22d.jpg
2016-05-31 18:28:42	Klemen702	what is it
2016-05-31 18:29:15	Scruffy	It's a cake made of mineral water and agar
2016-05-31 18:29:21	Klemen702	what is agar
2016-05-31 18:29:23	Scruffy	With an extremely light sweetness to it
2016-05-31 18:29:35	Scruffy	a natural gelatin made from seaweed
2016-05-31 18:29:53	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-31 18:29:55	Marty2000	Great
2016-05-31 18:29:55	Scruffy	it is served with brown sugar and sesame oil, but neither have to be added to the cake
2016-05-31 18:30:09	Klemen702	seems like better shit defenetly
2016-05-31 18:30:18	Scruffy	Apparently it melts in your mouth really quickly
2016-05-31 18:30:22	Marty2000	You make me want to taste it
2016-05-31 18:31:14	Scruffy	In that regard, you might like what inspired it, Japanese mochi
2016-05-31 18:31:27	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-31 18:31:42	Scruffy	Which are essentially little balls of ice cream wrapped in powdered rice dough
2016-05-31 18:31:52	Scruffy	flour is the powder
2016-05-31 18:31:53	Marty2000	I think I've already tasted one
2016-05-31 18:31:59	Klemen702	i want to try both
2016-05-31 18:32:08	Marty2000	With red beans
2016-05-31 18:32:16	Scruffy	Yeah, that's one of my favorites
2016-05-31 18:32:21	Scruffy	Although green tea is also good
2016-05-31 18:32:29	Scruffy	The only one I don't really enjoy is mango
2016-05-31 18:32:34	Marty2000	Never tried this one
2016-05-31 18:32:37	Marty2000	Neither the second
2016-05-31 18:32:44	Scruffy	the mango ice cream just doesn't go with the rice dough
2016-05-31 18:32:48	Marty2000	They look delicious.... he he
2016-05-31 18:32:51	Marty2000	I see

2016-05-31 18:32:55	Klemen702	tea also sucks
2016-05-31 18:32:56	Scruffy	But otherwise, mangos are my favorite fruit
2016-05-31 18:33:07	Scruffy	I'm afraid I have to disagree there
2016-05-31 18:33:10	Scruffy	I like tea
2016-05-31 18:33:16	Scruffy	Not sweet tea thoug
2016-05-31 18:33:19	Marty2000	Melons and watermelons are my favorite ones
2016-05-31 18:33:35	Marty2000	I like tea... and iced tea too :p
2016-05-31 18:33:41	Yoshi2	tea definitely doesn't suck
2016-05-31 18:33:57	Klemen702	watermelons and melons are fine but not good either
2016-05-31 18:34:19	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-31 18:34:19	Yoshi2	watermelons are not good?
2016-05-31 18:35:18	Klemen702	they are both
2016-05-31 18:35:20	Klemen702	good and not good

2016-05-31 18:35:26	Klemen702	they kinda don't have a taste
2016-05-31 18:35:36	Marty2000	If I had to invite you to eat, Klemen702, we would very likely eat in a restaurant. Our tastes are so different :p but that's fine
2016-05-31 18:35:46	Yoshi2	they are watery and sweet
2016-05-31 18:35:58	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-31 18:36:01	Klemen702	most of the time i sense just that
2016-05-31 18:36:02	Klemen702	water
2016-05-31 18:36:06	Klemen702	like some form of solid water
2016-05-31 18:36:09	Klemen702	that is not ice
2016-05-31 18:36:11	Marty2000	Maybe in watermelon
2016-05-31 18:36:18	Klemen702	marty
2016-05-31 18:36:19	Klemen702	we should eat
2016-05-31 18:36:21	Klemen702	spaghetti
2016-05-31 18:36:21	Marty2000	But there is much sugar in melon
2016-05-31 18:36:26	Klemen702	is good shit
2016-05-31 18:36:38	Klemen702	i taste no sugar in melon
2016-05-31 18:36:40	Klemen702	s
2016-05-31 18:36:50	Scruffy	I actually taste more sugar in melons than in a lot of fruit
2016-05-31 18:36:53	Klemen702	...
2016-05-31 18:36:57	Klemen702	i have a friend named Melon
2016-05-31 18:37:00	Marty2000	Same
2016-05-31 18:37:01	Scruffy	There's more sugar in lemons than in strawberries
2016-05-31 18:37:09	Scruffy	Just... randomly
2016-05-31 18:37:16	Klemen702	same to what?
2016-05-31 18:37:22	Klemen702	most likely to scruffy
2016-05-31 18:37:26	Marty2000	I always have to add some sugar when eating strawberries
2016-05-31 18:37:33	Yoshi2	<Klemen702> i taste no sugar in melon
2016-05-31 18:37:35	Marty2000	Yes, Klemen702
2016-05-31 18:37:36	Yoshi2	<Klemen702> i have a friend named Melon
2016-05-31 18:37:38	Yoshi2	ok
2016-05-31 18:37:55	Klemen702	is this a joke yoshi
2016-05-31 18:38:00	Marty2000	It was a reply to Scruffy's comment made several minutes ago on Pikipedia's chatroom. ;)
2016-05-31 18:38:04	Klemen702	i don't get it if so
2016-05-31 18:38:49	Scruffy	The fact that we live in different regions with different fruit markets may mean a slight difference in the sugariness of the fruits we eat
2016-05-31 18:39:04	Yoshi2	i guess you are old enough for that kind of stuff ( °▽ °) 
2016-05-31 18:39:17	Scruffy	And whether they are grown locally or not, in season or not, etc.
2016-05-31 18:39:26	Klemen702	@_@ confused
2016-05-31 18:39:43	Klemen702	u know what fruit i really hate
2016-05-31 18:39:44	Klemen702	pears
2016-05-31 18:39:47	Klemen702	they suck shit
2016-05-31 18:39:53	Marty2000	I love them :p
2016-05-31 18:39:57	Scruffy	Pears are 50/50 for me
2016-05-31 18:40:05	Scruffy	If they're soft, they're good
2016-05-31 18:40:06	Marty2000	So juicy
2016-05-31 18:40:12	Scruffy	If they're hard, they're hard to eat
2016-05-31 18:40:25	Klemen702	pears are like the only fruit i hate
2016-05-31 18:40:59	Yoshi2	you hate pears?
2016-05-31 18:41:00	Yoshi2	how
2016-05-31 18:41:09	Yoshi2	I can understand not liking them, but HATE?
2016-05-31 18:41:13	Scruffy	But that's just a matter of ripeness
2016-05-31 18:41:31	Klemen702	pears are evil
2016-05-31 18:41:37	Scruffy	Pears are on the substantially sweet side of the fruit spectrum
2016-05-31 18:41:43	Klemen702	my great great great great grandfather was murdered by a pear
2016-05-31 18:41:51	Klemen702	every night
2016-05-31 18:41:58	Klemen702	he keept losing ''pears'' of pants
2016-05-31 18:42:06	Scruffy	That sounds like one prickly pear
2016-05-31 18:42:34	Yoshi2	at this point I am fairly sure you just hate all sorts of sweetness
2016-05-31 18:42:37	Marty2000	What happened to the poor pear that killed him? :o
2016-05-31 18:42:57	Scruffy	Sorbet... the poor soul
2016-05-31 18:43:14	Marty2000	Heh
2016-05-31 18:43:52	Klemen702	if i hate sweetness
2016-05-31 18:43:55	Klemen702	does that mean i hate mars bars?
2016-05-31 18:44:15	Marty2000	I don't like mars bars, though.
2016-05-31 18:44:20	Scruffy	...yes, if you do hate sweetness mars bars are one of the sweeter things you can eat
2016-05-31 18:45:19	Scruffy	nougat, caramel, chocolate
2016-05-31 18:45:59	Klemen702	i made this image for this situation
2016-05-31 18:46:01	Marty2000	I either like or dislike caramel, it depends on what it is combined with
2016-05-31 18:46:02	Klemen702	http://pasteboard.co/1l2xuGKO.png
2016-05-31 18:46:39	Scruffy	heh
2016-05-31 18:46:43	Marty2000	Alone, I dislike it. With chocolate, I don't like it either. But in floating island, that's great!
2016-05-31 18:47:03	Scruffy	Caramel goes good with apple
2016-05-31 18:47:10	Scruffy	And so does peanut butter
2016-05-31 18:47:26	Scruffy	An apple half topped with peanut butter is one of my favorite snacks
2016-05-31 18:47:37	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-31 18:48:16	Klemen702	i want to eat

2016-05-31 18:54:32	Marty2000	I usually eat it with soya, otherwise I ate it in some Japanese cakes, that's all. I also like Japanese rice, it tastes... different

2016-05-31 18:55:25	Klemen702	and what is a soya

2016-05-31 18:56:02	Marty2000	Yes,
2016-05-31 18:56:34	Scruffy	A soybean is a magical bean that, when planted, creates a mighty soybeanstalk
2016-05-31 18:57:11	Scruffy	It's also really good with rice, healthy for your heart, and tasty when converted into a milk substitute

2016-05-31 19:42:55	Yoshi2	because the order of a typedef is so that the type you are defining comes last

2016-05-31 21:42:01	@Espyo	I'll try to keep an eye on it
2016-05-31 21:42:07	@Espyo	if it starts happening a lot, I'll warn Porple

2016-05-31 22:38:30	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-31 22:38:36	@Espyo	what was happening before? you were connecting and disconnecting
2016-05-31 22:38:39	@Espyo	everything all right?
2016-05-31 22:39:32	Scruffy	oh, yeah
2016-05-31 22:39:42	Scruffy	I just was in a place with unreliable internet
2016-05-31 22:39:45	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-31 22:39:53	Scruffy	but now I'm back in stable Wifi
2016-05-31 22:41:56	@Espyo	J: know any good git GUI clients?
2016-05-31 22:42:35	@Espyo	Scruffy: about this edit http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Reference&curid=1339&diff=165246&oldid=159258
2016-05-31 22:42:43	@Espyo	I'm not so sure if that's a reference to Mario...
2016-05-31 22:42:54	Scruffy	I guess so
2016-05-31 22:42:56	@Espyo	a fully-grown man with a moustache is Charlie
2016-05-31 22:43:03	Scruffy	Ohhhhh
2016-05-31 22:43:08	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-31 22:43:14	@Espyo	if not for that, then I'd definitely go for a reference
2016-05-31 22:43:16	Scruffy	I can't believe I didn't see that
2016-05-31 22:43:24	@Espyo	hah
2016-05-31 22:43:31	@Espyo	well, it happens
2016-05-31 22:43:43	@Espyo	it could still be a reference to Mario, but I think it's a bit of a stretch
2016-05-31 22:43:59	@Espyo	if she made a clearer connection with the karting aspect, then sure
2016-05-31 22:44:07	Scruffy	Yeah, that's a good point
2016-05-31 22:44:20	@Espyo	what do you lot think?
2016-05-31 22:46:31	@Espyo	Marty2000: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Digging&curid=18614&diff=165970&oldid=165892 how did you check this?
2016-05-31 22:46:40	@Espyo	by making the treasure appear on like a different cave, or challenge mode level?
2016-05-31 22:47:10	Marty2000	No, but like any other buried/semi-buried treasure, it respawns to its original location if it's left somewhere when the day ends
2016-05-31 22:47:22	Marty2000	I think I already told you this, but I'm not sure
2016-05-31 22:47:36	@Espyo	doesn't ring a bell
2016-05-31 22:47:38	@Espyo	anyway, sounds good to me
2016-05-31 22:48:10	Marty2000	About the reference, it could be possible linked to Mario Kart, but it's also clear that it's also a reference to Charlie. But I didn't notice about the Mario Kart possible reference :)
2016-05-31 22:48:14	Marty2000	possibly*
2016-05-31 22:48:23	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-31 22:49:58	Marty2000	By the way http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging#Digging_speeds I'll try for Pikmin 2 tomorrow, but I'm quite surprised it doesn't speed up the digging animations of Yellow Pikmin
2016-05-31 22:50:32	Marty2000	(for P3)
2016-05-31 22:50:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-31 22:50:44	Marty2000	It's true their animations are already faster than those of the other types
2016-05-31 22:50:55	Marty2000	But still...
2016-05-31 22:50:57	@Espyo	speaking of this...
2016-05-31 22:51:13	@Espyo	>and the power of every Pikmin type is the same as an unsprayed Blue Pikmin.
2016-05-31 22:51:16	@Espyo	I don't understand this part
2016-05-31 22:51:42	Marty2000	Every Pikmin power goes up/down to 10
2016-05-31 22:52:00	@Espyo	yeah, but I'm not sure if it's important to mention that here
2016-05-31 22:52:21	Marty2000	As you wish
2016-05-31 22:52:28	Marty2000	But I thought it could be important to add it because
2016-05-31 22:52:44	Marty2000	it somehow explains a little why Rock Pikmin are as fast as Yellow Pikmin
2016-05-31 22:52:53	@Espyo	woah, I don't wish anything, I'm just discussing ways to explain the findings :/
2016-05-31 22:53:07	@Espyo	yeah, the attack power is likely what influences the digging speed
2016-05-31 22:53:20	@Espyo	it matches up not just for Rocks, but for all types (except the Yellows, since they're special)
2016-05-31 22:53:21	Marty2000	Ah, don't worry, is "as you wish" impolite? Excuse me then :p
2016-05-31 22:53:32	@Espyo	but mentioning it in the spray part might be pointless
2016-05-31 22:53:38	@Espyo	well, it's not impolite...
2016-05-31 22:53:41	Marty2000	Okay, I see
2016-05-31 22:53:43	@Espyo	but it kinda makes it pass off as impolite to you
2016-05-31 22:53:49	@Espyo	as if you were a genie, blindly obeying orders
2016-05-31 22:54:23	Marty2000	I see. I usually say it like "if you want" but I guess it's not the same then.
2016-05-31 22:54:37	@Espyo	even still, it makes it sound like you're only doing stuff a certain way if I like it
2016-05-31 22:54:40	@Espyo	and that's not right
2016-05-31 22:55:14	@Espyo	maybe one day soon we'll be able to test changes made to Pikmin 3's files
2016-05-31 22:55:23	Marty2000	Well... I don't add stuff because you'd like it or not... careful to keep it in mind. It's just that I don't think I'm experienced with the wiki ;)
2016-05-31 22:55:24	@Espyo	we can see if changing attack powers also changes digging speeds
2016-05-31 22:55:31	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-31 22:55:42	Marty2000	I really want Pikmin 3 to be hacked soon
2016-05-31 22:55:49	@Espyo	yeah, I get that, but the way you word it almost makes it sound like I'm some supreme voice whose every will needs to be followed :P
2016-05-31 22:55:50	Marty2000	There are plenty of things I want to try 
2016-05-31 22:55:59	@Espyo	I'll try running Cemu under Wine
2016-05-31 22:56:03	@Espyo	...it MIGHT go well
2016-05-31 22:56:21	Marty2000	I see. I tried downloading Cemu, but it doesn't work on my computer... :/
2016-05-31 22:56:34	@Espyo	its minimal requirements are very high...
2016-05-31 22:56:42	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-31 22:57:05	Marty2000	Well, my computer works well... but it's quite old
2016-05-31 22:57:47	Marty2000	It's a Windows Vista
2016-05-31 22:57:56	Marty2000	which was bought in 2008
2016-05-31 22:58:26	@Espyo	well, it's loading
2016-05-31 22:58:28	@Espyo	oh!

2016-05-31 22:58:33	@Espyo	IT'S WORKING
2016-05-31 22:58:37	@Espyo	AND WHAT'S MORE, IT'S WORKING WELL
2016-05-31 22:58:44	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-05-31 22:58:48	@Espyo	well... at least the loading screen was
2016-05-31 22:58:50	Scruffy	Audio support?
2016-05-31 22:58:55	@Espyo	 30 FPS, but no more progress from here
2016-05-31 22:59:07	@Espyo	FPS is fluctuating, so it might be soon to say if it died
2016-05-31 22:59:27	Marty2000	 Good then

I want to make a Splatoon montage (precisely, a Bubbler montage, which could get hated, by the way :p ) I don't know whether I should make a long video (probably more than an hour) or several short videos. I think the latter could be a good option, but I'm not sure. Thanks!

2016-05-31 23:13:00	Marty2000	Okay, thanks. UltraMario, what do you think? 
2016-05-31 23:16:44	UltraMario	well
2016-05-31 23:16:50	Marty2000	I wonder how much people hate the Bubbler. I remember seeing tons of people complaining about it, and they have the right to, but if it's included in the game, then it must be used somehow. I think it's best when shared with others, and that's how I love it.
2016-05-31 23:16:50	UltraMario	probably short ones
2016-05-31 23:16:57	UltraMario	i like bubbler
2016-05-31 23:17:03	UltraMario	people are just salty :p
2016-05-31 23:17:06	UltraMario	dont mind them

2016-05-31 23:17:08	Marty2000	Okay, UltraMario, I'll go for short ones then. Thanks! :)
2016-05-31 23:17:10	@Espyo	but I am a fan of using it
2016-05-31 23:17:10	UltraMario	well
2016-05-31 23:17:11	@Espyo	of course
2016-05-31 23:17:13	UltraMario	using bub-
2016-05-31 23:17:13	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-31 23:17:14	UltraMario	heh
2016-05-31 23:17:15	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-31 23:17:32	@Espyo	truth be told, what annoys me is that when I'm a Bubbler, I get knocked around halfway across the ma
2016-05-31 23:17:33	@Espyo	*map
2016-05-31 23:17:46	Marty2000	Yes, that's the problem
2016-05-31 23:17:47	@Espyo	but when I fight off against a Bubbler, I shoot concentrated fire at them, and they don't even flinch
2016-05-31 23:17:47	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-31 23:18:13	Marty2000	It's better f shared with teammates having long-range weapons, I think
2016-05-31 23:18:49	Marty2000	And that's why it's so good with the Custom Hydra Splatling
2016-05-31 23:18:54	Marty2000	well, I think
2016-05-31 23:19:07	@Espyo	oh!
2016-05-31 23:19:11	@Espyo	I found the "problem"
2016-05-31 23:19:17	@Espyo	I had to configure my inputs
2016-05-31 23:19:25	@Espyo	I guess the game wasn't proceeding because there was no Wii U GamePad connected
2016-05-31 23:19:37	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-31 23:19:39	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-31 23:19:44	@Espyo	take 2...
2016-05-31 23:20:44	@Espyo	well, maybe
2016-05-31 23:20:47	@Espyo	it's not doing anything now
2016-05-31 23:21:06	@Espyo	it froze
2016-05-31 23:21:21	@Espyo	also, it looks like I can run EDITED games this way
2016-05-31 23:21:44	Marty2000	It would be awesome
2016-05-31 23:22:44	@Espyo	it's weird... I managed to see the blue warning you get when it says that it's saving
2016-05-31 23:22:49	@Espyo	but it happened right before it crashed
2016-05-31 23:22:58	@Espyo	and it crashed because apparently quitting out of the controls menu does that
2016-05-31 23:24:25	Scruffy	editing Pikmin 3 would be so cool

2016-05-31 23:24:31	@Espyo	it's definitely doable
2016-05-31 23:24:36	@Espyo	(at least with MK8)
2016-05-31 23:25:27	Marty2000	I think someone edited a little P3 once
2016-05-31 23:25:28	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-31 23:25:34	@Espyo	yeah

2016-05-31 23:25:42	@Espyo	CosmoCortney
2016-05-31 23:26:02	@Espyo	hm, I guess the emulator could also be failing because I'm trying to run a technically "broken" game
2016-05-31 23:26:06	@Espyo	I mean, I extracted a lot of the files
2016-05-31 23:26:14	Marty2000	Yes it's him
2016-05-31 23:26:16	@Espyo	the game SHOULD ignore the unzipped folders, but in case it doesn't, boom
2016-05-31 23:26:18	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-31 23:26:26	@Espyo	still, I'll try tomorrow on windows, if I can
2016-05-31 23:26:27	@Espyo	and have time
2016-05-31 23:26:34	@Espyo	I'll probably get home later than usual tomorrow again

2016-05-31 23:27:26	Marty2000	It's the same as the current nectar (Pikmin evolve directly to flower stage)
2016-05-31 23:27:35	Marty2000	Except that it is blue

2016-05-31 23:30:34	@Espyo	so I won't put it
2016-05-31 23:32:16	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Pikmin prerelease informa... by Marty (+36 /* Trailer 2 */) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=19079&diff=166004
2016-05-31 23:36:30	Scruffy	I think the one about Pikmin death would be an interesting one
2016-05-31 23:36:42	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Winged_Pikmin#Gallery Okay, I posted screenshots of Winged Pikmin running when burning/drowning when they atre thrown. And now I have another "oddity"
2016-05-31 23:36:50	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1464734156-winged-flowerpot.jpg
2016-05-31 23:37:10	Marty2000	Depending on where a Winged Pikmin is thrown (on a flowerpot)
2016-05-31 23:37:17	Marty2000	it will iehter fly or run
2016-05-31 23:37:20	Marty2000	either*
2016-05-31 23:37:21	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-31 23:37:33	Marty2000	Scruffy: Yes, I agree
2016-05-31 23:38:05	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Spirit That one, right?
2016-05-31 23:38:52	@Espyo	he means the poll, right?
2016-05-31 23:39:44	Marty2000	Oh, sorry, I thought he meant the article... heh
2016-05-31 23:40:49	Marty2000	It could be a good one yes... even though I feel like there may be more options to add (but I don't know what)
2016-05-31 23:40:59	Marty2000	5 is already good, sure
2016-05-31 23:41:43	Marty2000	"With me, it depends on game, Pikifan4 (talk) 14:31, 27 January 2016 (EST)"
2016-05-31 23:41:49	Marty2000	I think that option could be added
2016-05-31 23:42:01	@Espyo	maybe...
2016-05-31 23:42:07	@Espyo	also, I'm wondering how I could shorten the existing options
2016-05-31 23:42:10	@Espyo	what they say is TOO long
2016-05-31 23:42:19	Marty2000	It's okay for me if some Pikmin die in P1, but it's the horror when a single one dies in P2
2016-05-31 23:42:28	Marty2000	I immediatley reset the console
2016-05-31 23:42:28	@Espyo	really? hmm...
2016-05-31 23:42:35	@Espyo	ok, sounds good
2016-05-31 23:42:52	Marty2000	Mostly because of White and Purple Pikmin 
2016-05-31 23:43:08	Marty2000	And for P3, it depends on my mood :p
2016-05-31 23:43:26	Marty2000	I tthink it's an option that deserves to be added, anyway
2016-05-31 23:43:40	Marty2000	I'm trying to think of another one...
2016-05-31 23:44:25	@Espyo	I guess it also depends on what I'm doing
2016-05-31 23:44:34	@Espyo	if I'm playing my first time through, I always stick through with my mistakes
2016-05-31 23:44:40	Marty2000	"Depends on where I am or what I have done since the last save"
2016-05-31 23:44:49	Marty2000	Yes, that's a good one too
2016-05-31 23:44:52	@Espyo	if it's like my second playthrough or just a casual playthrough to do something, I'll reset if I lose to many, but if it's only a few, I don't care
2016-05-31 23:44:58	@Espyo	but if I'm doing a zero-run, then obviously...
2016-05-31 23:45:05	Scruffy	Same with Espyo
2016-05-31 23:45:10	@Espyo	but the problem is, adding these "depends" options ruins the point
2016-05-31 23:45:15	Scruffy	*I agree
2016-05-31 23:45:26	Scruffy	True
2016-05-31 23:45:28	@Espyo	pretty much nobody has a fixed plan for what to do if a Pikmin dies
2016-05-31 23:45:33	@Espyo	everybody will flock to the "depends" options
2016-05-31 23:45:38	@Espyo	defeating the purpose of a poll to begin with
2016-05-31 23:45:53	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-31 23:47:48	Scruffy	Maybe the cut enemies poll then
2016-05-31 23:48:48	@Espyo	we've had problems with that one before
2016-05-31 23:48:56	@Espyo	the options are a bit specific, and grouped
2016-05-31 23:49:06	Scruffy	Ah
2016-05-31 23:49:11	@Espyo	plus a LOT of enemies were removed from P3
2016-05-31 23:49:12	Marty2000	Off-topic, but I thought of something else for the Pikmin infobox. Why not add "digging speed"? It could be average for Blue Pikmin, below average for White Pikmin/Winged Pikmin, etc.
2016-05-31 23:49:27	@Espyo	Marty2000: good idea, but let's not do anything yet
2016-05-31 23:49:30	@Espyo	let's figure out P2 first
2016-05-31 23:49:40	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-31 23:49:54	Marty2000	But I think I already figured it out for P2 and posted the results here...
2016-05-31 23:49:58	Marty2000	I'll retry tomorrow though
2016-05-31 23:50:01	Marty2000	But basically
2016-05-31 23:50:04	@Espyo	plus that poll has few votes
2016-05-31 23:50:11	Marty2000	It's the same for every pikmin but Reds and Purples
2016-05-31 23:50:19	@Espyo	the Pikmin 4 platform is high up, but I'm not so sure about it
2016-05-31 23:50:26	@Espyo	as for "wanting", almost everybody will say Wii U
2016-05-31 23:50:30	@Espyo	it won't make a very interesting poll
2016-05-31 23:50:33	@Espyo	nobody wants it on the NX
2016-05-31 23:50:35	Marty2000	True
2016-05-31 23:50:37	@Espyo	having to buy a new console for the game
2016-05-31 23:50:47	@Espyo	some will probably vote for the 3DS systems
2016-05-31 23:50:55	@Espyo	but it won't be enough to make it a healthy poll imo
2016-05-31 23:51:01	@Espyo	also the mess about 3DS vs New 3DS
2016-05-31 23:52:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-31 23:52:31	@Espyo	well, the current winner besides all else is the favorite area in P3
2016-05-31 23:52:38	@Espyo	it's a simple one, no need to overthink it
2016-05-31 23:52:40	@Espyo	and it's nearing midnight
2016-05-31 23:52:47	@Espyo	although we don't NEED to update at midnight on the dot
2016-05-31 23:52:52	@Espyo	I'd rather not go to sleep several minutes later
2016-05-31 23:52:54	@Espyo	rest is important >_>
2016-05-31 23:54:23	Scruffy	heh
2016-05-31 23:54:58	@Espyo	I'd really prefer if we could get a P4 poll going
2016-05-31 23:55:01	Marty2000	I'm gonna o. See you soon!
2016-05-31 23:55:05	Marty2000	go*
2016-05-31 23:55:07	@Espyo	I still feel like our opinions could help mould the game
2016-05-31 23:55:08	@Espyo	see ya Marty
2016-05-31 23:55:11	Scruffy	Bye Marty!

2016-05-31 23:55:51	@Espyo	of the ones we have... let's see which would actually help mould the game
2016-05-31 23:55:55	@Espyo	the platform one probably wouldn't
2016-05-31 23:56:11	@Espyo	Nintendo knows that people want it on the Wii U, and they'll only put it on the NX if it's a business strategy
2016-05-31 23:56:23	@Espyo	on the 3DS or New 3DS, if they want to put it there, they've already started working for that
2016-05-31 23:56:28	@Espyo	they aren't changing that halfway through
2016-05-31 23:56:34	@Espyo	so our choices couldn't mean a thing
2016-05-31 23:56:39	Scruffy	Hmmm
2016-05-31 23:56:44	@Espyo	relaxing vs challenging story mode...
2016-05-31 23:56:51	Scruffy	They've probably already decided a story
2016-05-31 23:56:58	@Espyo	might be too late for that; the main gameplay balance is probably done already
2016-05-31 23:57:28	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-31 23:57:40	@Espyo	what man-made environment... that one's still so disorganize
2016-05-31 23:57:41	@Espyo	*d
2016-05-31 23:57:59	@Espyo	none of the other ones would really have any impact
2016-05-31 23:58:02	Scruffy	Something that I would vote for (but I don't know anyone else) would be what graphical enhancement people would want to see
2016-05-31 23:58:09	@Espyo	so I guess we can go with whatever
2016-05-31 23:58:12	@Espyo	hm, examples?

2016-05-31 23:59:51	Scruffy	umm, dust particles, multiple/soft shadows, translucency in materials like skin
2016-05-31 23:59:55	Scruffy	things like that
2016-06-01 00:00:04	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-01 00:00:05	Scruffy	gotta go for now
2016-06-01 00:00:11	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think many people would vote for that
2016-06-01 00:00:12	Scruffy	night Espyo!
2016-06-01 00:00:15	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-01 00:00:15	@Espyo	not even I'd know what I'd pick

2016-06-01 20:19:26	Marty2000	Ok, I have a sort of glitch that Espyo needs to know, and it's a very bad one, and of course, easy to reproduce. It skips the Ship's announcements for the series http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Treasure_Series which is why I sadly cannot complete everything... and which means I'll have to restart again, again, and again Pikmin 2 :p

2016-06-01 20:26:46	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-06-01 20:26:46	Testyo	Blues are probably an edit of this http://pasteboard.co/B5OuVJK.jpg though (from the first 6 months that is removed later?
2016-06-01 20:27:58	Marty2000	Hey, that's a screenshot I posted some time ago, Testyo :p

2016-06-01 20:33:36	Marty2000	So, I don't know if this is a glitch, but it really makes me angry because I have to start another save if I want screenshots... You know, when you've completed a series, you can see the ship's announcement for that series in the Treasure Hoard... but only until you collect another treasure... which means that if you complete the series, but don't check the 
2016-06-01 20:33:56	Marty2000	Treasure Hoard for the ship's announcement, and finally, you retrieve a treasure and try to check the treasure Hoard
2016-06-01 20:34:14	Marty2000	there won't be any annoucement :/
2016-06-01 20:34:22	Marty2000	announcement*
2016-06-01 20:35:31	@Espyo	hm, let me get this straight
2016-06-01 20:35:50	@Espyo	you get all treasures of a series one day
2016-06-01 20:35:57	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-01 20:35:57	@Espyo	you do not enter the Treasure Hoard that day
2016-06-01 20:36:01	@Espyo	you enter a new day, get a different treasure
2016-06-01 20:36:09	@Espyo	go into the Treasure Hoard at the end of that day
2016-06-01 20:36:19	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-01 20:36:22	@Espyo	and you are no longer given a rundown of the series you unlocked the previous day

2016-06-01 20:55:47	Yoshi2	currently the map view widget only has the positions of all units, so I can only draw points
2016-06-01 20:56:00	@Espyo	right
2016-06-01 20:56:24	Yoshi2	some of the entities are actually map zones so for these it would also be helpful to draw the area around the entity
2016-06-01 20:56:41	Yoshi2	so I will add the area size as some sort of metadata

2016-06-01 22:19:21	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging I would like to try to get approximate times for each object tomorrow, but since every Pikmin digs at a different speed... I was wondering if we should use the times we obtain with Blue Pikmin, since they're the most balanced species. 
2016-06-01 22:20:17	Marty2000	For partially buried objects in P3, since it's slightly random (but not completely), we can give a range
2016-06-01 22:20:39	@Espyo	sounds good
2016-06-01 22:22:00	Marty2000	Okay, I'll work on this tomorrow then ;) I think we could also add Mission modes objects, as well as... pellets, and other stuff
2016-06-01 22:24:09	@Espyo	might take a really long while...
2016-06-01 22:24:42	Marty2000	Yes, that's true... but I think the article would be complete, on the other hand.

2016-06-01 22:28:16	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Dirt_mound   http://www.pikminwiki.com/Tunnel   I wonder if different types have different times for those thngs too
2016-06-01 22:28:58	@Espyo	probably... the game is crazy enough for it
2016-06-01 22:29:02	Marty2000	I suppose it should be tested as well
2016-06-01 22:29:09	Marty2000	I'll try now, we'll see
2016-06-01 22:29:16	@Espyo	if we can change the game's files and play it
2016-06-01 22:29:32	@Espyo	it might be possible to check if all dirt mounds/tunnels/treasures/etc. have a setting that controls the speeds
2016-06-01 22:29:48	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-01 22:30:46	Marty2000	Ok, I'm testing with a dirt mound in Mission Mode
2016-06-01 22:30:54	Marty2000	The Red Pikmin finished digging in 25 seconds
2016-06-01 22:31:01	Marty2000	Checking with a Yellow one
2016-06-01 22:31:58	Marty2000	Same for the Yellow Pikmin...
2016-06-01 22:32:46	Marty2000	So Dirt Mounds seem not to be affected
2016-06-01 22:33:37	Marty2000	I'll try with a tunnel if I can
2016-06-01 22:34:17	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-01 22:35:08	Marty2000	But anyway, it seems "quite logical" in that Yellows are not faster, but Reds should be faster in that case because they're more powerful... really weird
2016-06-01 22:37:14	Marty2000	Ok, I have found a tunnel, I'll try now

2016-06-01 22:42:18	Marty2000	Same time, so it's likely not random. I'm going to try with a Winged Pikmin

2016-06-01 22:46:07	Marty2000	There's likely a difference for tunnels, but again, it might work differently
2016-06-01 22:46:18	Marty2000	Yellow Pikmin's animations are not sped up
2016-06-01 22:46:36	Marty2000	So I guess Red and Rock Pikmin would be faster here
2016-06-01 22:46:40	Marty2000	I'll try
2016-06-01 22:47:11	Marty2000	I believe the order would be Winged===Blue/Yellow===Red===Rock
2016-06-01 22:48:15	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-01 22:49:03	Marty2000	Hmm... 1 min 22 for Rocks
2016-06-01 22:49:25	Marty2000	I expected them to be faster... but really twice as fast
2016-06-01 22:49:41	Marty2000	I have to try with Reds and Blues, that's not right...
2016-06-01 22:50:35	@Espyo	what a mess...
2016-06-01 22:51:38	Marty2000	1 min 29/30 for Reds
2016-06-01 22:52:03	Marty2000	Going to try with Blues
2016-06-01 22:54:10	Marty2000	1 min 44 sec for Blues, same as Yellows
2016-06-01 22:55:15	Marty2000	So the order I believed was right, but for the results... That's okay for Blues and Yellows, as well as Winged Pikmin
2016-06-01 22:55:32	Marty2000	But for Rocks...
2016-06-01 22:56:12	Marty2000	(And Reds)
2016-06-01 23:00:32	Marty2000	I think I've understood, finally. Let me perform a few more experiments to confirm my thoughts

2016-06-01 23:08:23	Marty2000	So, when digging a unel, there are two phases
2016-06-01 23:08:34	Marty2000	First, the Pikmin have to dig the entrance to the tunnel
2016-06-01 23:08:53	Marty2000	Once it's done, they can dig inside the tunnel, then
2016-06-01 23:09:16	Marty2000	And each Pikmin type has different speeds only when digging the entrance
2016-06-01 23:09:25	Marty2000	The speed is the same for every Pikmin when digging inside it
2016-06-01 23:09:41	Marty2000	And NOW it makes sense
2016-06-01 23:09:51	Marty2000	Rocks are twice as fast as Yellows and Blues when digging the entrance
2016-06-01 23:10:00	Marty2000	But are as fast as them when digging inside the tunnel
2016-06-01 23:11:42	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-01 23:11:43	@Espyo	cool!
2016-06-01 23:11:50	@Espyo	how can you tell when they go from "entrance" to "inside"?
2016-06-01 23:12:22	Marty2000	You can see the Pikmin digging when it's the entrance, and you can't see it when it's "inside"

2016-06-01 23:13:54	@Espyo	probably include it directly
2016-06-01 23:13:58	@Espyo	also it likely isn't a glitch

2016-06-01 23:24:05	@Espyo	that's weird
2016-06-01 23:24:40	Marty2000	It's the same for your talk page when I ask something
2016-06-01 23:25:11	@Espyo	is it the browser that lags, or does the page just take forever to download?

2016-06-01 23:26:11	Marty2000	Only for massive pages
2016-06-01 23:26:19	Marty2000	And only when I edit

2016-06-01 23:26:36	@Espyo	sounds like a browser problem to me then
2016-06-01 23:26:44	@Espyo	you may want to try to click the "Edit" button on a section

2016-06-02 10:33:35	Marty2000	Modify the page then, he will maybe react :p
2016-06-02 10:33:54	Marty2000	Or maybe he thinks it's too complicated and so he ignores you... 
2016-06-02 10:34:02	Yoshi2	better idea
2016-06-02 10:34:08	Yoshi2	I will modify his talk page
2016-06-02 10:34:20	Marty2000	Yes, that's better
2016-06-02 10:34:28	Yoshi2	and say
2016-06-02 10:34:57	Yoshi2	"Hey you fucking idiot, I'm fed up with your bullcrap!"
2016-06-02 10:35:07	Yoshi2	jk that would be an instant ban

2016-06-02 10:39:27	Yoshi2	what is that even supposed to be?
2016-06-02 10:39:32	Yoshi2	the photo is horrible
2016-06-02 10:39:47	Marty2000	Itook it from Wikipedia
2016-06-02 10:40:01	Marty2000	Hmm, I don't know hte English names. I'll check (called "Bugne" here)
2016-06-02 10:40:23	Marty2000	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_wings Seems like it's called Angel Wings
2016-06-02 10:41:14	Yoshi2	Raderkuchen
2016-06-02 10:41:17	Yoshi2	never heard of it
2016-06-02 10:42:05	Yoshi2	in the photo you posted it looked like weird fortune cookies
2016-06-02 10:42:43	Marty2000	Comes from https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugne
2016-06-02 10:42:59	Marty2000	I don't think that's a fortune cookie :p
2016-06-02 10:47:14	Yoshi2	but even on a better picture I have no idea what to expect
2016-06-02 10:48:31	Yoshi2	ok going back to doing uni stuff again

2016-06-02 14:48:25	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Maturity#In_alternative_game_modes I''ve partially solved the mystery, but I have to perform more experiments
2016-06-02 14:49:57	Yoshi2	more experiments
2016-06-02 14:50:00	Yoshi2	more science
2016-06-02 14:50:19	Marty2000	Is that wrong?

2016-06-02 14:51:45	Marty2000	Is saying "more experiments" wrong?
2016-06-02 14:52:13	Yoshi2	no

2016-06-02 14:52:46	Marty2000	I see. Sorry! Of course, more science :D
2016-06-02 14:53:11	Marty2000	And what I'm doing confirms more and more my theory, he he
2016-06-02 14:53:26	Yoshi2	idk how correct "do more science" is but me and a guy I know always talk about doing science :P
2016-06-02 14:53:56	Marty2000	I don't know, but sounds correct to me
2016-06-02 14:54:35	Marty2000	I guess it's "do science", according to the name of this site http://www.doscience.com/
2016-06-02 14:55:21	Yoshi2	well, it's less formal than doing experiments
2016-06-02 14:55:23	Marty2000	So you're totally right
2016-06-02 14:56:46	Marty2000	Perhaps, but the meaning is approximately the same, I suppose
2016-06-02 14:58:27	Yoshi2	do science might be more general
2016-06-02 15:00:12	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-02 15:08:58	Marty2000	Ok, I have completely solved that thing, that wasn't hard after all
2016-06-02 15:09:07	Marty2000	It's related to a glitch that happens in P1, P2 and P3
2016-06-02 15:09:16	Marty2000	but for the first two games, it only happens for enemies
2016-06-02 15:09:31	Marty2000	whereas in P3, it affects Pikmin that are evolving...

2016-06-02 18:00:06	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well, I want to add it to a category that matches what it does
2016-06-02 18:00:48	Cheepy-Cheepy	be right back
2016-06-02 18:00:51	Yoshi2	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Special:Categories mhm, that's quite a few categories
2016-06-02 18:02:46	Cheepy-Cheepy	I know
2016-06-02 18:03:37	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well, I think you're looking for http://www.pikminfanon.com/Category:Enemies
2016-06-02 18:12:52	Yoshi2	at most, maybe I'd look for a category that means something like "spider-like enemies"
2016-06-02 18:13:34	Yoshi2	other than that, doesn't seem like there are many categories it would fit in
2016-06-02 18:14:06	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps I'll create one in the future
2016-06-02 18:14:55	Cheepy-Cheepy	Those spiders from Pikmin don't fit into a category either I think
2016-06-02 18:15:00	Cheepy-Cheepy	Pikmin 3*
2016-06-02 18:15:36	Cheepy-Cheepy	Arachnodes
2016-06-02 18:21:37	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps...
2016-06-02 18:21:46	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps just "Insect Enemies"?

2016-06-02 18:47:16	@Espyo	<Scruffy> Something about what /type/ of enemy you'd prefer to see more of in P4

2016-06-02 18:48:25	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/yaxX_D51-gM That's funny... I guess this happens because there's no specific path for Winged Pikmin, so they take the same path as other types and so they also walk... 
2016-06-02 18:48:35	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Maturity#In_alternative_game_modes Also, I solved this mystery
2016-06-02 18:48:57	Scruffy	It seems like there are enough categories there already, unless someone else adds it to their game and describes it more in-depth
2016-06-02 18:49:02	@Espyo	hm, I opened a video on my subscriptions

2016-06-02 18:49:09	Yoshi2	I think so too
2016-06-02 18:49:27	@Espyo	Marty2000: hmm... yeah, maybe
2016-06-02 18:49:32	@Espyo	I still have to try to figure out the path system better
2016-06-02 18:49:51	@Espyo	oh, you did?
2016-06-02 18:49:53	@Espyo	that's awesome!
2016-06-02 18:49:59	Marty2000	Yes, and that's... stupid :p
2016-06-02 18:50:11	Marty2000	I'll explain you, that's easy to understand and test
2016-06-02 18:50:27	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Off-camera_limbo That glitch affects enemies in P1 and P2... and P3
2016-06-02 18:50:35	Marty2000	And it also affects Pikmin in P3
2016-06-02 18:50:43	Marty2000	So basically, if they're off-camera, they do not evolve
2016-06-02 18:50:47	Marty2000	Same in Story Mode

2016-06-02 18:55:20	Marty2000	At first, we thought there were different rules for Mission Mode because of that
2016-06-02 18:55:44	Marty2000	But after more experiments (science to make Yoshi2 glad), I found out it was because they were off-camera

2016-06-02 18:56:40	Marty2000	And by off-camera, I mean you do not watch them through the KopPad/Radar either
2016-06-02 18:56:44	@Espyo	right
2016-06-02 18:56:51	Marty2000	Nor do you leave a leader close to them

2016-06-02 18:57:29	@Espyo	and not very fair
2016-06-02 18:57:41	Marty2000	Yeah...
2016-06-02 18:57:44	Scruffy	Yeah, that's pretty crazy
2016-06-02 18:57:52	@Espyo	you keep your Pikmin buried on purpose, so returning to the base later to see them bloomed, and finding they're not, is just bad design
2016-06-02 18:59:12	Scruffy	Is there a parameter we've identified in the pikmin files that controls that? I think in P2 it's called "dynamics"
2016-06-02 18:59:41	Scruffy	Because with enemies dynamics is set to "LOD"; with leaders and Pikmin it's set to "never"
2016-06-02 19:00:00	@Espyo	I don't remember this...
2016-06-02 19:00:06	@Espyo	but either way, no, I don't think I have
2016-06-02 19:00:10	@Espyo	but we DO know that Pikmin move off-camera
2016-06-02 19:00:16	@Espyo	otherwise the entire game concept wouldn't be possible
2016-06-02 19:00:21	@Espyo	so it really is just the maturation
2016-06-02 19:00:27	@Espyo	...and maybe other shenanigans
2016-06-02 19:00:37	@Espyo	I wonder if having a Pikmin drink nectar off-camera works
2016-06-02 19:00:39	Marty2000	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69jQsdokXAjs-GI And that will be added to [[WInged Pikmin]]!

2016-06-02 19:05:09	Marty2000	So I guess you have to stand quite far

2016-06-02 19:16:53	Yoshi2	Espyo: considering my ping was ignored once again, would putting a note right on his talk page be a good idea? 
2016-06-02 19:17:58	@Espyo	at this point, I'd make the change and say "see talk"
2016-06-02 19:18:04	Marty2000	Actually, they are as fast when carrying something on the ground
2016-06-02 19:18:14	@Espyo	(by "say", I mean write it on the summary)
2016-06-02 19:18:22	@Espyo	oh, that's awesome
2016-06-02 19:19:44	Marty2000	I wonder if we could find other objects with which they would carry on the ground as well...
2016-06-02 19:21:33	Marty2000	But as I said, it's likely because they don't have any specific path for them to take in the air, so they take the path with the lily pads, which makes them walk
2016-06-02 19:22:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-02 19:22:31	Marty2000	It only happens with that fragment pile, by the way
2016-06-02 19:23:34	@Espyo	yeah, I don't remember any other time
2016-06-02 19:24:02	Marty2000	Well, normally, they're not supposed to build that bridge, so it's quite "normal"
2016-06-02 19:24:22	Marty2000	Any other bridge besides one in the Garden of Hope can be build with them

2016-06-02 19:27:22	Scruffy	Perhaps if Winged Pikmin drink nectar near bridge fragments, they will walk to the fragments
2016-06-02 19:27:22	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-02 19:27:47	Marty2000	That could be possible, since they need to walk to drink nectar. Good idea
2016-06-02 19:28:02	Scruffy	I just don't know where nectar occurs right next to fragments
2016-06-02 19:28:22	@Espyo	it might never
2016-06-02 19:28:26	Marty2000	I already know that if Winged Pikmin where thrown away by rocks or wind, they will walk

2016-06-02 19:30:00	@Espyo	discoverIES
2016-06-02 19:30:05	@Espyo	you found several scenarios where they walk
2016-06-02 19:30:14	Marty2000	Well, yeah
2016-06-02 19:30:23	Marty2000	But in those ones, they'd only walk for a few seconds
2016-06-02 19:30:31	Marty2000	Here, they can walk for a lot of time

2016-06-02 19:31:17	Marty2000	I'm trying to think of a place where there is some nectar and fragments together, Scruffy... maybe Mission Mode
2016-06-02 19:31:51	Yoshi2	hmm, I'm not sure how well it would be taken if I undid the change
2016-06-02 19:32:04	@Espyo	yeah, same
2016-06-02 19:32:07	@Espyo	but you DID give a reason this time
2016-06-02 19:32:17	Yoshi2	I SHOULD be on the safe side and it does look like the admin doesn't care that much, but still
2016-06-02 19:32:20	Marty2000	(or any other thing that could require them to walk)
2016-06-02 19:32:44	Yoshi2	alternatively, might be that I should ping him in the morning at 10-12 on the clock UTC+2
2016-06-02 19:33:04	Yoshi2	iirc he is from NZ, so that means like +8-10 hours to his time

2016-06-02 19:38:40	Marty2000	It's impossible, there are no seesaw blocks in the Twilight River
2016-06-02 19:39:05	Marty2000	So we cannot know...
2016-06-02 19:39:28	Marty2000	Unless someone hacks the game and fins a way to put a seesaw block on the way to the bridge, you cannot test, heh

2016-06-02 19:44:26	Marty2000	Of course, they made those paths for the fragments that you can find in the Twilight River Remix... as well as patched the glitch that leads to the pinkonion in Sotry Mode
2016-06-02 19:44:31	Marty2000	pink Onion*
2016-06-02 19:44:39	Marty2000	(for the remix)
2016-06-02 19:46:30	Marty2000	Oh, hmm, I might also try the walking Winged Pikmin with other maturities... I could already prove that some walking animations only happen to flower Winged Pikmin (which makes everything even stranger)
2016-06-02 19:48:31	@Espyo	hm, I also don't remember this :|
2016-06-02 19:48:48	Marty2000	Yeah, I probably didn't mention that, though
2016-06-02 19:48:55	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-02 19:49:35	Marty2000	Mostly because I wasn't sure and this needs more information
2016-06-02 19:50:45	Marty2000	Ok, it works with leaf Pikmin too
2016-06-02 19:51:51	Marty2000	Also, Scruffy, you've given me an idea. You can push these walking Pikmin while they're carrying fragments... maybe we could lead them to some nectar with the Iridescent Flint Bettle near the Onion
2016-06-02 19:52:12	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-02 19:53:57	@Espyo	ooh, yeah
2016-06-02 19:54:12	Marty2000	I'll grow a leaf Pikmin and we'll see
2016-06-02 19:55:04	Marty2000	Time to test
2016-06-02 19:56:18	Marty2000	Hmm, that's hard... I have to try again
2016-06-02 19:59:26	Marty2000	The nectar is quite far, I should try to have it directly on the path
2016-06-02 20:02:05	Yoshi2	I added zone rendering to my editor!
2016-06-02 20:02:29	Yoshi2	slightly at the cost of FPS because now it takes 0.02-0.03 seconds for one frame :I

2016-06-02 20:05:19	Marty2000	The Pikmin stops, the fragment disappears, and it flies again (idle) :/
2016-06-02 20:05:35	Marty2000	It evolves, of course
2016-06-02 20:05:40	Marty2000	But nothing special appears
2016-06-02 20:06:09	Scruffy	Aww man
2016-06-02 20:06:33	Marty2000	We should have the Pikmin drink nectar near fragments so it could take them by running.... but it seems impossible to have nectar near fragments... sorry :/
2016-06-02 20:07:36	@Espyo	hmm... wonder why it's so expensive, though

2016-06-02 20:35:04	Marty2000	I think the Winged Pikmin walk because theycarry something on a lily pad.... hmm, what if we try to put a 1 Pellet on a lily pad and order a Pikmin to retrieve it? I'll try if possible
2016-06-02 20:36:42	Marty2000	Okay, it's already possible to drop a 1 Pellet on a lily pad, but I wasn't fast enough to retrieve it. 
2016-06-02 20:37:13	Scruffy	What happens if a 1 pellet stays on a lily pad until it can't go any farther
2016-06-02 20:37:14	Scruffy	?
2016-06-02 20:38:10	Marty2000	When a 1 pellet is on a lily pad.... it doesn't follow the lily pad movement.... it's a bit strange, but imagine you drop the pellet in the middle of the lily pad... the latter will follow the river, but the pellet will remain idle, and so it will fall at one point
2016-06-02 20:38:28	Scruffy	Ah, I see
2016-06-02 20:39:51	Marty2000	Well, nothing happens in particular
2016-06-02 20:42:04	@Espyo	yeah, like the lily pad is made of ice
2016-06-02 20:48:16	Marty2000	I wonder if those Pikmin could be crushed too, but once again, it's impossible to try... the Yellow Wollywogs are too far
2016-06-02 20:48:35	Scruffy	I guess that makes sense; the lily pads are the only moving platforms in the game and Pikmin/leaders obviously don't treat them like normal platforms
2016-06-02 20:49:19	Scruffy	So they don't program friction on the moving platform, I wouldn't be surprised if the leaders and Pikmin treat it like static terrain all the same
2016-06-02 20:50:35	Scruffy	How did you get a pellet on the lily pad in the first place?
2016-06-02 20:51:06	Marty2000	There's one in a cave in the Twilight River
2016-06-02 20:51:26	Marty2000	And Winged Pikmin fly above lily pads when carrying it back to their Onion
2016-06-02 20:52:57	Scruffy	Ah, nice
2016-06-02 20:54:20	Marty2000	Oh... Espyo, you remember the trick with the dodge move allowing you to push small objects...? Maybe we can test if Winged Pikmin would still take lily pads by moving the berries of theBurgeoning Spiderwort...
2016-06-02 20:54:33	Marty2000	Yoshi2: Yes, I'm still selling dots ;
2016-06-02 20:54:36	@Espyo	hm, maybe, but they have a time limit
2016-06-02 20:54:36	Marty2000	;)*
2016-06-02 20:54:43	@Espyo	I think they only live for 40 seconds until the vanish
2016-06-02 20:54:47	Scruffy	Even in Pikmin 3?
2016-06-02 20:54:48	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-02 20:54:51	@Espyo	at least in Pikmin 2 they do
2016-06-02 20:54:52	Marty2000	But they're very close
2016-06-02 20:55:05	Scruffy	Oooh, I want to see them splat in Pikmin 3, how the graphics have improved
2016-06-02 20:55:18	Marty2000	They simply vanish

2016-06-02 21:01:06	Yoshi2	on a quick count I received far more than 400 so I guess it's close enough to 550
2016-06-02 21:01:51	Marty2000	It's precisely 550

2016-06-02 21:06:29	Marty2000	And they take their path in the air when coming back to the Spiderwort
2016-06-02 21:07:40	Marty2000	However, they will always take the same path as long as you do not whistle them
2016-06-02 21:10:21	Yoshi2	oooo this actually works: http://i.imgur.com/Z332IE8.png
2016-06-02 21:10:38	Marty2000	Then, I could use the dodge move to bring a pellet to that place, we'll see how they react since they're supposed not to have a path in the air....

2016-06-02 21:50:34	Marty2000	Also, I'll ask you again, now that we have collected the values we needed... What do you think about adding the digging speed to the Pikmin infobox?
2016-06-02 21:51:04	@Espyo	I think we should add it
2016-06-02 21:51:08	@Espyo	but as subjective
2016-06-02 21:51:15	@Espyo	so like average, higher than average, slow, etc.
2016-06-02 21:51:17	Marty2000	Okay, thanks. 
2016-06-02 21:51:21	Marty2000	Yes, that's why I thought too
2016-06-02 21:51:26	@Espyo	we don't know exact numbers yet, although it seems more than likely that it's just the attack power
2016-06-02 21:52:43	Marty2000	Yes, except for Yellows when they dig items (but again, it's just because of the speed)
2016-06-02 21:53:05	Marty2000	You can see with [[Tunnel]] that's it's "more than likely" based off of their power

2016-06-02 22:52:40	@Espyo	which only exist in Smash 4 and the Pikmin 3 manual
2016-06-02 22:52:45	@Espyo	oh, and Pikmin 1 manual, I think
2016-06-02 22:53:46	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.pt/Jogos/Wii-U/Pikmin-3-640076.html
2016-06-02 22:53:55	Marty2000	There is the name for WInged and Rock Pikmin, here
2016-06-02 22:54:05	@Espyo	oh, so there is
2016-06-02 22:54:15	@Espyo	I'll check tomorrow
2016-06-02 22:54:33	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-02 22:56:13	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.pt/Jogos/Wii/NEW-PLAY-CONTROL-Pikmin-2-282354.html#Jogo Don't forget that too. ;)
2016-06-02 22:56:27	Marty2000	I might check other Nintendo sites too
2016-06-02 22:56:59	Marty2000	I could check the Dutch one... but I'll probably need a translator for it, unless the menus are exactly the same
2016-06-02 22:57:29	@Espyo	hm, never really thought about trying it
2016-06-02 22:57:44	@Espyo	there'll be some cool stuff here
2016-06-02 22:57:45	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-06-02 22:57:50	Marty2000	No problem
2016-06-02 22:57:52	@Espyo	NPC!P1 might be around here somewhere too
2016-06-02 22:58:08	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-06-02 22:58:11	@Espyo	>palm and a half pals
2016-06-02 22:58:12	@Espyo	uh...
2016-06-02 22:58:20	@Espyo	I know palm and a half is an expression (at least here) to mean small
2016-06-02 22:58:26	@Espyo	but they're definitely not a palm and a half :|
2016-06-02 22:58:36	Marty2000	There's this https://www.nintendo.pt/Jogos/Nintendo-GameCube/Pikmin-268533.html
2016-06-02 22:58:39	Marty2000	I see...
2016-06-02 22:58:46	Marty2000	And this https://www.nintendo.pt/Jogos/Wii/NEW-PLAY-CONTROL-Pikmin-282343.html
2016-06-02 23:00:37	Marty2000	Time to check Dutch
2016-06-02 23:00:45	Marty2000	I could check Russian, but it's even harder...
2016-06-02 23:01:19	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-02 23:01:43	@Espyo	well, that GC P1 page is empty
2016-06-02 23:01:55	Marty2000	Portuguese is fine to me because it's very close to Spanish, Dutch is understandable (I need a trsnlator though)... but I will have a hard time with Russsian because of the different  alphabet
2016-06-02 23:02:00	Marty2000	Yeah, there are only atworks
2016-06-02 23:02:04	Marty2000	artworks*
2016-06-02 23:02:05	@Espyo	right
2016-06-02 23:02:22	Marty2000	I wonder if it's the same on other Nintendo sites
2016-06-02 23:02:24	Marty2000	I'll check Fr
2016-06-02 23:02:58	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.fr/Jeux/Nintendo-GameCube/Pikmin-268533.html The same but with text
2016-06-02 23:03:26	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-02 23:03:48	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.pt/games/oms/pikmin3/gameplay_safe.html Here, there's no text, but you can have it using a function of Google Chrome... wait
2016-06-02 23:04:02	Marty2000	The Developer Tools
2016-06-02 23:04:51	Marty2000	For example, there's no text in the Portuguese Pikmin 3 page
2016-06-02 23:05:00	Marty2000	But using the developer tools with Google Chrome, I can read
2016-06-02 23:05:04	Marty2000	"As sementes de Pikmin que saem da Onion costumam ser da mesma cor que os Pikmin que transportaram o objeto. "
2016-06-02 23:05:09	Marty2000	So maybe it's a glitch?
2016-06-02 23:07:14	@Espyo	on the Pikmin 3 page?
2016-06-02 23:07:15	@Espyo	there's text for me
2016-06-02 23:07:20	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-02 23:07:32	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.pt/games/oms/pikmin3/gameplay_safe.html You have text here?
2016-06-02 23:08:15	@Espyo	not here
2016-06-02 23:08:18	@Espyo	looks like THAT is glitched
2016-06-02 23:08:26	Marty2000	Yes, thats what I said
2016-06-02 23:08:40	@Espyo	https://www.nintendo.pt/Jogos/Wii-U/Pikmin-3-640076.html but it's fine here
2016-06-02 23:08:43	Marty2000	"As sementes de Pikmin que saem da Onion costumam ser da mesma cor que os Pikmin que transportaram o objeto. " This should be the text under the red Onion
2016-06-02 23:08:57	Marty2000	And there's absolutely no text for the P1 page, though (Gamecube)
2016-06-02 23:09:49	Marty2000	A tua equipa de Pikmin transportará os objetos que encontrares – fruta nutritiva, por exemplo – para a tua nave espacial para serem depois processados. É também na SS Drake que te esconderás à noite, quando o planeta se tornar demasiado perigoso para ser explorado.
2016-06-02 23:09:52	Marty2000	This is for the Drake
2016-06-02 23:10:29	Marty2000	That's strange... The Pikmin  games have tons of glitches, even on their websites :p
2016-06-02 23:11:14	@Espyo	right

2016-06-02 23:13:41	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.nl/Spellen/Nintendo-GameCube/Pikmin-268533.html There's text...
2016-06-02 23:14:11	Marty2000	Do we even have that artwork on Pikipedia? https://cdn02.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/08_content_images/games_6/gamecube_11/gcn_pikmin2_1/CI16_GCN_Pikmin2_02_CMM_small.png

2016-06-02 23:50:28	Marty2000	Voilà! Finished. By the way, we also have some identical images
2016-06-02 23:50:31	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-02 23:50:32	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-06-02 23:50:45	Marty2000	I'll check, that could be useful
2016-06-02 23:51:01	Marty2000	Those images, for example...

2016-06-02 23:52:54	Marty2000	There are lots of interesting unused files, wow
2016-06-02 23:53:08	Marty2000	There are some I haven't seen anywhere else

2016-06-02 23:55:30	Marty2000	Or is it the model?
2016-06-02 23:55:50	@Espyo	oh, please tag any identical images for deletion
2016-06-02 23:55:57	@Espyo	(well, one of the images in a pair of twins, that is, not both)
2016-06-02 23:56:08	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-02 23:56:17	@Espyo	it might be the model
2016-06-02 23:56:18	Marty2000	I'll do when I see identical images, no worries
2016-06-02 23:56:21	@Espyo	especially since it's transparent
2016-06-02 23:56:27	@Espyo	all right, cool
2016-06-02 23:56:30	Marty2000	Yeah, that's what I thought
2016-06-02 23:56:34	@Espyo	I'm gonna head off now
2016-06-02 23:56:40	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-02 23:56:42	Marty2000	Good night
2016-06-02 23:56:45	@Espyo	oh, btw, you should add all of the discoveries you found today to your todo list
2016-06-02 23:56:50	@Espyo	because those things cannot just be lost to time
2016-06-02 23:56:58	Marty2000	Hmm?
2016-06-02 23:57:01	@Espyo	every once in a while, we forget to add some stuff on the wiki
2016-06-02 23:57:04	Marty2000	Winged Pikmin and Maturity
2016-06-02 23:57:06	@Espyo	and I remember it later

2016-06-03 00:08:57	Marty2000	Hi again, PikFan
2016-06-03 00:09:55	@PikFan	so, the same guy on Google+ now used Scruffy's Lunar Long Legs in a picture
2016-06-03 00:10:03	Marty2000	:/
2016-06-03 00:10:13	Marty2000	I saw Scruffy's answer
2016-06-03 00:10:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-03 00:10:26	@PikFan	he wants people to attribute his work
2016-06-03 00:10:37	Marty2000	That's really cool he allows people to use some of his renders... whereas said people do not credit him
2016-06-03 00:10:42	@PikFan	so... I just left a comment on his post telling him to attribute his work
2016-06-03 00:10:45	@PikFan	I know...
2016-06-03 00:10:51	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-03 00:10:59	@PikFan	hopefully he'll comply
2016-06-03 00:11:17	@PikFan	I really hope he doesn't claim that he made the images or something crazy like that
2016-06-03 00:11:36	@PikFan	this is what I said:
2016-06-03 00:11:36	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 00:11:38	@PikFan	Hey there. I've noticed you've been using some renders by my friend Scruffy. Namely his Red Pikmin render and his Lunar Long Legs. He doesn't mind people using his images as long as they give credit. So will you give proper attribution next time? Thank you.
2016-06-03 00:11:52	Marty2000	I see, that's good
2016-06-03 00:12:25	@PikFan	it's a bit of a warning, but not too forceful
2016-06-03 00:13:40	Marty2000	Yeah, I think it's good 
2016-06-03 00:13:49	Marty2000	 mean, it's well worded
2016-06-03 00:13:55	Marty2000	I think he'll understand ;)

2016-06-03 10:32:25	Marty2000	I don't even know if I'll be able to finish eat, in which case my cat might be happy

2016-06-03 10:32:49	Yoshi2	ice cream?
2016-06-03 10:32:55	Marty2000	No, cheese
2016-06-03 10:33:28	Yoshi2	I ate a chocolate muffin my dad bought yesterday
2016-06-03 10:33:41	Marty2000	I see :p
2016-06-03 10:34:16	Yoshi2	plus some other stuff
2016-06-03 10:34:59	Marty2000	That Klemen702 would not probably like
2016-06-03 10:35:15	Yoshi2	definitely not
2016-06-03 10:35:36	Yoshi2	he'd get cancer and tumors and heavy coughing and aids all at once if he ate this
2016-06-03 10:36:32	Marty2000	He would convulse too
2016-06-03 12:22:35	Yoshi2	this looks fiiine https://i.imgur.com/tZcKBoR.png
2016-06-03 12:26:24	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-03 13:12:21	Yoshi2	now comes the part where I'm just messing around with the editor
2016-06-03 13:12:30	Yoshi2	and doing fun stuff 
2016-06-03 13:17:26	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-03 14:06:27	Yoshi2	Marty2000: for my next chapter of "How to eat healthy", I am eating a chocolate donut
2016-06-03 14:06:43	Yoshi2	with a fork
2016-06-03 14:28:16	Marty2000	I still haven't eaten my lunch, by the way
2016-06-03 14:28:18	Marty2000	Hmm
2016-06-03 14:28:31	Marty2000	I prefer fruit donut, but the chocolate one is good too
2016-06-03 14:28:42	Marty2000	My favorite is probably the raspberry donut :p
2016-06-03 14:29:47	Marty2000	favourite*
2016-06-03 14:41:36	Marty2000	Where are you at with the "Panther"?
2016-06-03 14:41:53	Marty2000	Did you get any answer during the past few hours? 
2016-06-03 15:04:56	Yoshi2	Marty2000: nope, seems like the guy won't reply unless I remind him again
2016-06-03 15:07:23	Marty2000	:/
2016-06-03 15:14:43	Marty2000	Yoshi2: Just watch the first seconds... and check Super-toad65's comment https://youtu.be/yaxX_D51-gM Do they look like they're flying at ground level during the first seconds of my video? 
2016-06-03 15:15:05	Marty2000	I don't want to be mean, but each time I make a video showing strange things, this guy comes and tell me that I'm wrong
2016-06-03 15:15:19	Marty2000	So it's getting quite bothersome, to be honest
2016-06-03 15:16:45	Marty2000	It's true that at one point, they fly at ground level for few seconds, but it's really short... otherwise, they d walk
2016-06-03 15:16:48	Marty2000	DO walk*
2016-06-03 15:17:31	Marty2000	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69jQsdokXAjs-GI Unless I'm completely blind, they're walking here, right?
2016-06-03 15:21:06	Yoshi2	Marty2000: in the video they aren't moving their wings, so they are definitely walking
2016-06-03 15:21:14	Yoshi2	and the screenshot shows feet on the ground
2016-06-03 15:22:44	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 15:22:57	Marty2000	Only when they're not carrying fragments they fly, but that's normal
2016-06-03 15:23:30	Marty2000	I replied to him with the screenshot, because you can clearly see...
2016-06-03 15:28:05	Marty2000	Yoshi2: Anyway, some of these walking animations are weird... particularly those when they are burning
2016-06-03 15:28:07	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/f0/Montage_Winged_fire.png
2016-06-03 15:28:16	--	sleepi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-06-03 15:28:23	Marty2000	You can see on this montage that they can either run or fly, depending on the circumstances
2016-06-03 15:28:38	Marty2000	But even though they are running, they're still considered as "flying"
2016-06-03 15:28:49	Marty2000	SO they can run on water and run in the air
2016-06-03 15:29:16	Marty2000	even though→even if*
2016-06-03 15:50:50	Yoshi2	mhm, that might be some sort of property that is not specific to whether they walk or fly
2016-06-03 15:51:36	Yoshi2	e.g. fire pikmin are always fire resistant, water pikmin are always water-resistant, and flying pikmin can always traverse all terrain
2016-06-03 15:53:29	Marty2000	Oh yeah, but what I mean is that depending on what you do before the Winged Pikmin gets burnt, it will either have a running animation (like other types) or a flying animation (unique). And what is weird is that even when they run like other types, they can fly if they encounter a wall for example
2016-06-03 15:53:51	Marty2000	To make it short, they run but the game considers them as flying
2016-06-03 15:54:04	Marty2000	I could try to get better screenshots later, that's quite hard to explain...
2016-06-03 15:54:12	Yoshi2	that's what I meant
2016-06-03 15:54:23	Marty2000	Ah :p
2016-06-03 15:54:42	Marty2000	I thought you were telling me that WInged Pikmin couldn't resist fire and that's all
2016-06-03 15:54:44	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-06-03 15:55:10	Yoshi2	red pikmin can resist fire, blue pikmin can resist water and winged pikmin can go over everything
2016-06-03 15:55:11	Marty2000	Well, in my video, though, they are really considered as walking
2016-06-03 15:55:41	Marty2000	Otherwise they would walk a little over the ground at one point
2016-06-03 15:55:46	Marty2000	Yeah, that seems to be that
2016-06-03 15:58:08	Yoshi2	hm, maybe winged pikmin do have a real walking state
2016-06-03 15:59:29	Yoshi2	either that, or the AI commands the pikmin as if they were walking
2016-06-03 16:00:54	Yoshi2	I don't have the source code so all I can do is talk out of my butt
2016-06-03 16:01:01	Yoshi2	:P
2016-06-03 16:03:56	Yoshi2	your video shows them behaving similar to regular walking pikmin, so it is weird indeed
2016-06-03 16:04:17	Marty2000	I'll have to take a video of the case where they walk but act like flying Pikmin
2016-06-03 16:04:19	Marty2000	It's easy
2016-06-03 16:04:25	Marty2000	I just have things to do for the moment
2016-06-03 16:04:40	Marty2000	But I'll try to have a video soon, so that you and Espyo can see

2016-06-03 18:44:33	Testyo	Greetings everyone!
2016-06-03 18:45:06	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-06-03 18:45:07	Testyo	unless we decide we could get EU ISOs to run on Dolphin uncompressed
2016-06-03 18:45:25	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-06-03 18:45:26	Testyo	the buried Pikmin and the seed are the wikians lazying around: not any more
2016-06-03 18:46:31	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-03 18:48:06	Yoshi2	Espyo: angled rectangles: https://i.imgur.com/tZcKBoR.png
2016-06-03 18:48:30	Yoshi2	and I kinda added a way to speed up rendering by allowing the user to toggle which objects are shown
2016-06-03 18:49:55	@Espyo	sweet!
2016-06-03 18:51:44	Yoshi2	and it is possible to rotate units/zones by putting/changing the angle into that text box on the right
2016-06-03 18:52:22	Yoshi2	the way the game stores angles in the levels is weird
2016-06-03 18:53:15	Yoshi2	there is one angle defining which direction the unit looks
2016-06-03 18:53:33	Yoshi2	and another that points 90 degrees to the right of that angle
2016-06-03 18:53:33	Testyo	90 degrees = 1.5708 rad
2016-06-03 18:53:39	Yoshi2	Testyo: so rad
2016-06-03 18:53:39	Testyo	I think I put it on my fortune?
2016-06-03 18:53:50	@Espyo	hm, that is pretty weird
2016-06-03 18:53:58	@Espyo	oh, might be because of looping around
2016-06-03 18:54:09	@Espyo	if you need 90 angles to the right, you use that angle, instead of trying to add or subtract
2016-06-03 18:54:17	@Espyo	which could go to negatives or over whatever limit they put
2016-06-03 18:54:23	@Espyo	angles are pretty awful in general in code :|

2016-06-03 19:01:54	Marty2000	I don't know
2016-06-03 19:01:56	@Espyo	oh, I'm thinking of something else
2016-06-03 19:02:06	Marty2000	I noticed that while playing
2016-06-03 19:02:12	@Espyo	I'm thinking of the article itself, where it was asking for a before-and-after image of getting the Stellar Orb on a regular cave
2016-06-03 19:02:20	@Espyo	but I could swear that somebody once pointed this out
2016-06-03 19:02:23	Marty2000	So I thought it could be cool to take screenshots of this and add it to the wiki, but tell you that beforehand
2016-06-03 19:02:24	@Espyo	[[Cavern of Chaos]]

2016-06-03 19:02:32	Testyo	"Stellar_Orb" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Stellar_Orb
2016-06-03 19:02:57	@Espyo	nope, nothing about the Cavern of Chaos
2016-06-03 19:03:03	@Espyo	let me check the game's files
2016-06-03 19:03:04	Marty2000	Now that you mention it... It doesn't seem unfamiliar, indeed
2016-06-03 19:03:10	@Espyo	the game doesn't really light up the place
2016-06-03 19:03:16	@Espyo	it just uses a lighting file for the cave
2016-06-03 19:03:22	@Espyo	and an alternative lighting file if you have the Stellar Orb
2016-06-03 19:03:36	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-03 19:03:40	@Espyo	if somebody wrote the files wrong, or chose the wrong one for the normal/SO versions, boom
2016-06-03 19:03:49	@Espyo	I might be able to see what's up
2016-06-03 19:03:58	Marty2000	I wonder if it happens for other caves too
2016-06-03 19:04:09	@Espyo	like, if the "normal" lighting file is called like cavern_of_chaos_10_light and the SO one is cavern_of_chaos_10
2016-06-03 19:04:13	@Espyo	(it's not)
2016-06-03 19:04:20	@Espyo	and all others are picked the other way around
2016-06-03 19:04:20	Marty2000	That requires some time, but that's so exciting to see such things, he he :D
2016-06-03 19:04:22	@Espyo	then that's a clear mistake
2016-06-03 19:04:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 19:04:29	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-03 19:04:39	@Espyo	if I find that it's a mistake, and it's easy to catch, then it should be easy
2016-06-03 19:04:49	@Espyo	should be easy to find other instances
2016-06-03 19:05:13	Marty2000	Ah!

2016-06-03 19:05:30	Marty2000	"Particularly: The Pikmin Wiki page claims this has the opposite effect on sublevel 10 of the Cavern of Chaos. Confirm."
2016-06-03 19:05:40	@Espyo	ah!
2016-06-03 19:05:43	Marty2000	I think I've already seen it, now
2016-06-03 19:05:49	@Espyo	haha, so we DID have it
2016-06-03 19:05:52	Marty2000	But well, I have screenshots
2016-06-03 19:05:56	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 19:05:57	@Espyo	yeah!
2016-06-03 19:06:23	Marty2000	I guess it should be added to the Stellar Orb article as well
2016-06-03 19:06:30	Marty2000	Also, this is just a trivia thing
2016-06-03 19:06:47	Marty2000	But you can see the cave being lit up when the treasure is being retrieved by the ship
2016-06-03 19:06:56	Marty2000	(the subterranean complex)
2016-06-03 19:07:05	@Espyo	oh, you mean gradually?
2016-06-03 19:08:13	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-03 19:08:30	Marty2000	Between the moment the treasure is under the ship and its name is shown
2016-06-03 19:08:36	Marty2000	You can clearly see it
2016-06-03 19:08:45	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-03 19:08:48	@Espyo	I guess I never noticed it
2016-06-03 19:08:54	@Espyo	you can add it to the upgrade article too
2016-06-03 19:08:56	Marty2000	Well, at least on Dolphin :p
2016-06-03 19:08:58	@Espyo	and the treasure's article as well
2016-06-03 19:09:00	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-03 19:09:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-03 19:09:11	@Espyo	then it could be an emulation quirk...
2016-06-03 19:09:24	@Espyo	it should be tested on the GC one day
2016-06-03 19:09:25	Marty2000	I do think I've seen that on Wii
2016-06-03 19:09:29	Marty2000	despite being harder to see
2016-06-03 19:09:37	Marty2000	That's the Gamecube version I use
2016-06-03 19:09:41	Marty2000	(on Dolphin)
2016-06-03 19:10:13	Marty2000	If I use the Wii version, for some reasons, it might took me years to finish a day ...
2016-06-03 19:10:20	Marty2000	might take*
2016-06-03 19:10:31	@Espyo	yeah, the Wii game on Dolphin runs much slower
2016-06-03 19:11:07	Marty2000	I don't know if I could add that as a trivia thing in the [[Stellar Orb]] article
2016-06-03 19:11:08	Testyo	"Stellar_Orb" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Stellar_Orb
2016-06-03 19:11:15	Marty2000	Or directly in the gallery
2016-06-03 19:12:00	@Espyo	the CoC10 thing?
2016-06-03 19:12:06	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 19:12:10	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-03 19:12:12	@Espyo	I'd say gallery
2016-06-03 19:12:15	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-03 19:12:17	@Espyo	ideally, we should avoid the trivia section entirely
2016-06-03 19:12:24	@Espyo	the trivia should only be for stuff that REALLY doesn't fit anywhere else
2016-06-03 19:12:31	@Espyo	if it fits somewhere else, then well, it should go there
2016-06-03 19:12:39	@Espyo	you know, Wikipedia doesn't use trivia
2016-06-03 19:12:44	@Espyo	and their reasoning is really solid
2016-06-03 19:12:55	@Espyo	in short, it's because we're trying to show people objective information
2016-06-03 19:12:58	@Espyo	just the facts, as they are
2016-06-03 19:13:15	@Espyo	and then suddenly we turn into a clickbait article that has subjective stuff that's more "awesome" than the rest of the info
2016-06-03 19:13:23	@Espyo	that's just silly

2016-06-03 19:14:35	@Espyo	but CoC10 uses light.ini

2016-06-03 19:20:16	Scruffy	On the subject of the Stellar Orb, I noticed it doesn't /just/ make darkness in caves go away. I had edited a lighting file for the Up Late mod, mainly to make the lighting greener, and found that with the Stellar Orb it actually got much darker

2016-06-03 19:22:15	Scruffy	Only one
2016-06-03 19:22:20	@Espyo	we're trying to figure out why CoC10 gets DARKER if you have the Stellar Orb
2016-06-03 19:22:32	@Espyo	like I said above, it's the only one in that cave that uses light.ini
2016-06-03 19:22:34	Scruffy	I'll have to figure out exactly what I changed
2016-06-03 19:22:35	@Espyo	might even be the only one in the game
2016-06-03 19:22:39	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-03 19:23:07	Marty2000	Guess we'll have to check for each cave
2016-06-03 19:23:54	@Espyo	on it
2016-06-03 19:25:37	Marty2000	Well, I have a save where I have all areas unlocked, and I don't have the Stellar Orb yet... I'll take a look
2016-06-03 19:26:11	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-03 19:26:20	@Espyo	ONLY CoC10 uses that lighting file
2016-06-03 19:26:27	@Espyo	some unused caves do too, but I'm not counting those
2016-06-03 19:26:37	Scruffy	So I changed tutorial_1_light.ini
2016-06-03 19:26:37	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-03 19:26:38	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-03 19:29:55	Scruffy	Okay, so here's what I changed (not what the Stellar Orb does, but what I changed in the lighting file)
2016-06-03 19:30:11	@Espyo	right
2016-06-03 19:30:28	Scruffy	The distance to the light source is normally 1500, I changed it to 1500000
2016-06-03 19:31:34	@Espyo	yikes... is that really the best way to do what you wanted to?
2016-06-03 19:31:42	Scruffy	Just as a test
2016-06-03 19:32:00	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-03 19:32:00	Scruffy	I removed all the color from the main light
2016-06-03 19:32:20	Scruffy	Except it's still at 255 brightness
2016-06-03 19:34:42	Scruffy	I decreased the red and blue of specular lights
2016-06-03 19:34:46	Scruffy	highlights*
2016-06-03 19:35:02	Scruffy	they're normally all at 255, so everything has white highlights
2016-06-03 19:35:06	@Espyo	hm, I can see that that attribute, for tutorial_1_light.ini, is the only one that's not duplicate
2016-06-03 19:35:13	@Espyo	like, if you scroll down, it has all of the parameters again
2016-06-03 19:35:15	@Espyo	they're all the same

2016-06-03 19:35:44	Scruffy	Yeah, and I don't know why
2016-06-03 19:36:35	Scruffy	I also (this is probably what did it) greatly increased the RGB values of the ambient light, but changed its alpha from 50 to 0
2016-06-03 19:36:45	Scruffy	Sorry, from 0 to 50
2016-06-03 19:37:47	Scruffy	So it's substantially more visible
2016-06-03 19:38:14	@Espyo	right
2016-06-03 19:39:02	Scruffy	But I don't know what light.ini did that makes it different from a normal lighting file
2016-06-03 19:39:47	Marty2000	After the lie about Yellow Pikmin being always faster diggers, now "The artificial sunlight it emanates will (always) brighten underground areas"
2016-06-03 19:39:58	@Espyo	for one thing, it doesn't have the duplicates
2016-06-03 19:39:58	Marty2000	The Pikmin series is a lie. :/
2016-06-03 19:40:12	@Espyo	though I'm not sure if all files lack a duplicate, and tutorial_1_light is the oddball
2016-06-03 19:40:43	Scruffy	if the universe is infinite, then Pikmin exist somewhere, and a version of Pikmin exist where the Stellar Orb does light up CoC sublevel 10
2016-06-03 19:40:54	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-03 19:41:18	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-03 19:41:56	Scruffy	Anyway, light.ini seems to be the only one that /doesn't/ have a duplicate
2016-06-03 19:42:33	Scruffy	That is, it doesn't have two "spot type setting"s
2016-06-03 19:42:46	Scruffy	With two sets of light values, fog values, and shadow values
2016-06-03 19:44:30	-->	Klemen702 (Mibbit@86.61.jwq.jv) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-03 19:44:35	Scruffy	Ordinarily we could just say "Since light.ini only has one set of light values, they're true with or without the Solar System," but that's not the case; without the Solar System it's brighter
2016-06-03 19:44:38	Klemen702	hoi
2016-06-03 19:44:45	Scruffy	Hi Klemen702
2016-06-03 19:45:08	Marty2000	Hi Klemen702
2016-06-03 19:46:09	Scruffy	From your photo, Marty, it looks like the fog values there are normal, the way they're described in the light.ini file
2016-06-03 19:46:26	Scruffy	Is there still black fog in that sublevel without the Solar System?
2016-06-03 19:46:33	Scruffy	But just, really far away?
2016-06-03 19:46:53	Marty2000	I don't think so
2016-06-03 19:47:13	Marty2000	I could take more screenshots of the level without the Solar System, if needed
2016-06-03 19:47:21	Marty2000	I'll do so, it'll perhaps help you
2016-06-03 19:47:27	Scruffy	Wait, I was looking at the wrong photo
2016-06-03 19:47:50	Scruffy	So the values /after/ you collect the Solar System look true to the file
2016-06-03 19:48:21	@Espyo	yeah... (at the light.ini things)
2016-06-03 19:49:45	@Espyo	wait, why doesn't it match?
2016-06-03 19:49:54	@Espyo	the first set of parameters is without the SS
2016-06-03 19:50:04	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-03 19:50:05	@Espyo	wait
2016-06-03 19:50:12	@Espyo	ok, so, what if the first set of parameters is WITH the SS?
2016-06-03 19:50:15	@Espyo	and the second without?
2016-06-03 19:50:20	Scruffy	Perhaps
2016-06-03 19:50:31	Scruffy	light.ini only has one set of parameters though
2016-06-03 19:50:36	Scruffy	Which is the mysterious part
2016-06-03 19:50:44	@Espyo	damage in the game files is specified for when you DO have the Metal Suit Z
2016-06-03 19:50:45	@Espyo	so...
2016-06-03 19:50:55	@Espyo	light.ini almost looks like a placeholder
2016-06-03 19:51:11	@Espyo	and the default value for a sublevel's lighting, until the devs specify a specific one
2016-06-03 19:51:16	@Espyo	and they forgot for CoC10
2016-06-03 19:52:11	Scruffy	Hey Marty, how does CofC10 /with/ the Solar System look while you are falling into it
2016-06-03 19:52:16	@Espyo	gonna try it out
2016-06-03 19:52:22	Scruffy	Like in the cutscene before you start?
2016-06-03 19:52:33	Marty2000	Hmm... I can try, but I have to retrieve it before
2016-06-03 19:52:43	Marty2000	I can already take screenshots of the sublevel without it
2016-06-03 19:52:51	Marty2000	Then, I'll retrieve it and tell you ;)
2016-06-03 19:53:05	Marty2000	Tell me all screenshots you need
2016-06-03 19:53:09	@Espyo	that's it!
2016-06-03 19:53:14	@Espyo	the first set is WITH the SS, the second without
2016-06-03 19:53:21	@Espyo	I changed the distance on the first set to something tiny
2016-06-03 19:53:29	@Espyo	and lo and behold, on my save with the SS, I can barely see a thing
2016-06-03 19:54:10	@Espyo	wow, you can see the individual floor triangles light up...
2016-06-03 19:54:58	Scruffy	Here's an interesting tidbit in my mod
2016-06-03 19:55:07	Marty2000	By the way, I don't know if it's because I use the JPn version, and I didn't take any screenshot... but if someone can, please go to the Dream Den (sublevel 9) and open the pause menu
2016-06-03 19:55:13	Marty2000	The Radar should show a very strange map
2016-06-03 19:55:27	@Espyo	Marty2000: want me to do it on the JP version?
2016-06-03 19:55:31	@Espyo	or NOT on the JP version?
2016-06-03 19:55:37	Marty2000	As you wish, but preferably
2016-06-03 19:55:43	Marty2000	Uh
2016-06-03 19:55:46	Marty2000	If you want... he he
2016-06-03 19:55:49	Scruffy	So I didn't realize I did this but I accidentally changed all 1 Pellet Posies to fire geysers in the Valley of Repose after day 10
2016-06-03 19:56:03	@Espyo	you're saying you found a weird map on JP GC P2
2016-06-03 19:56:04	Scruffy	I took out 25 Blue Pikmin and ended the day
2016-06-03 19:56:11	@Espyo	so I should use a non-JP game to check if the map's also weird
2016-06-03 19:56:11	@Espyo	right?
2016-06-03 19:56:17	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 19:56:22	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-03 19:56:28	Marty2000	I'll take a screenshot afterwards
2016-06-03 19:56:37	Scruffy	And 2 of them caught fire during the sunset cutscene
2016-06-03 19:56:40	Marty2000	Right now, I'm going to S10CoC
2016-06-03 19:56:46	@Espyo	does the Dream Den have walls?
2016-06-03 19:56:51	@Espyo	gonna take a single Purple with me if not
2016-06-03 19:57:05	@Espyo	I cannot be bothered to navigate a full army though the Wistful Wild... WITH A KEYBOARD
2016-06-03 19:57:14	Scruffy	Ha
2016-06-03 19:57:25	@Espyo	Scruffy: that's awesome
2016-06-03 19:57:29	@Espyo	what happens then?
2016-06-03 19:57:35	Marty2000	They are clogq
2016-06-03 19:57:36	Marty2000	clogs*
2016-06-03 19:57:41	Scruffy	Here's the weird thing: none of the fire geysers were near them
2016-06-03 19:57:42	Marty2000	You should take White Pikmin!
2016-06-03 19:57:46	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-03 19:57:49	Marty2000	I'd say... 50
2016-06-03 19:57:58	@Espyo	hmm, good idea
2016-06-03 19:58:00	Scruffy	But the two of them died
2016-06-03 19:58:01	@Espyo	they won't drag behind
2016-06-03 19:58:09	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-03 19:58:11	Scruffy	Here's the weirder part:
2016-06-03 19:58:14	@Espyo	so the cutscene can actually change their outcome
2016-06-03 19:58:24	Scruffy	If I skipped the cutscene so they didn't die, it didn't show up on the report
2016-06-03 19:58:29	@Espyo	of course
2016-06-03 19:58:30	<--	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-06-03 19:58:33	Scruffy	In essence I didn't lose any 
2016-06-03 19:58:33	@Espyo	it didn't technically happen
2016-06-03 19:58:49	Scruffy	But if I let them die and show sprites, I lost two Blue Pikmin, but no reason counted
2016-06-03 19:59:03	-->	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-03 19:59:03	Scruffy	Not because of sunset or fire, or any reason
2016-06-03 19:59:27	Scruffy	And they never even touched the fire!
2016-06-03 19:59:29	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-03 19:59:45	@Espyo	wait, what happens if you lure an enemy to the landing site
2016-06-03 19:59:52	@Espyo	will it be there on the gathering cutscene?
2016-06-03 20:00:03	Scruffy	Enemies disappear during the cutscene
2016-06-03 20:00:11	Scruffy	But apparently fire geysers don't
2016-06-03 20:00:30	@Espyo	right
2016-06-03 20:00:38	@Espyo	ooh!
2016-06-03 20:00:43	@Espyo	what about Gatling Groink shots?
2016-06-03 20:00:48	Scruffy	So maybe the Pikmin thought they were touching fire, but it didn't register with the game
2016-06-03 20:00:53	Scruffy	Oooh, that'd be tricky
2016-06-03 20:01:04	@Espyo	might be easier on an emulator
2016-06-03 20:01:10	@Espyo	I'll try after I do what Marty needs
2016-06-03 20:01:10	Scruffy	On it
2016-06-03 20:01:14	@Espyo	oh, okay
2016-06-03 20:01:21	Marty2000	Scruffy:
2016-06-03 20:01:22	@Espyo	Marty2000: do I need to do anything in particular?
2016-06-03 20:01:23	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1464980466-10.png
2016-06-03 20:01:53	Marty2000	Now, move a little in the sublevel to unlock the entire map on the radar and open it
2016-06-03 20:02:32	Scruffy	Yep, that is definitely what it should look like /after/ the Solar System, but somehow it's before
2016-06-03 20:04:10	@Espyo	GREAT, a Careening Dirigibug left me with 7
2016-06-03 20:04:11	@Espyo	ugh
2016-06-03 20:04:32	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-03 20:04:42	@Espyo	infinite sprays ftw
2016-06-03 20:05:22	Scruffy	Forget luring the Groink at the Wistful Wild, I'll just make one where I want it!
2016-06-03 20:05:39	@Espyo	Marty2000: the map seems fine to me...
2016-06-03 20:05:44	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-03 20:05:48	@Espyo	you have THE POWER
2016-06-03 20:05:59	UltraMario	YOU GOT THE TOUCH
2016-06-03 20:06:10	UltraMario	YOUVE GOT THE POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
2016-06-03 20:06:15	Marty2000	Really? That's odd... I'll show you what I have
2016-06-03 20:08:37	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-03 20:09:09	@Espyo	wait...
2016-06-03 20:09:15	@Espyo	that {0001} at the start
2016-06-03 20:09:19	@Espyo	it's {0000} for light.ini
2016-06-03 20:09:24	@Espyo	I'll check the comment on that line
2016-06-03 20:09:32	@Espyo	version!
2016-06-03 20:09:35	@Espyo	that solves the mystery
2016-06-03 20:09:49	@Espyo	light.ini is using version 0 of the light configuration file format
2016-06-03 20:09:59	@Espyo	which only has one set of data
2016-06-03 20:10:12	Scruffy	Groink shots disappear during the gathering cutscene
2016-06-03 20:10:21	@Espyo	midway through development, they realized "ok, so we're adding the Solar System... which means we need new lighting files"
2016-06-03 20:10:33	@Espyo	"or just rework the current files into a new file format to support SS and non-SS lighting"
2016-06-03 20:10:44	@Espyo	and hence version 0001 was born
2016-06-03 20:10:51	@Espyo	the game can load 0000 and 0001 files
2016-06-03 20:11:04	@Espyo	and what it does with them depends on the version
2016-06-03 20:11:18	@Espyo	that's why the first set is with-SS for 0001, and without-SS for 0000
2016-06-03 20:11:30	@Espyo	now, what happens if you use the SS on a version 0000 file?
2016-06-03 20:11:32	@Espyo	well, there's no data
2016-06-03 20:11:36	@Espyo	so I'm guessing the game uses the defaults
2016-06-03 20:11:38	@Espyo	some dark defaults
2016-06-03 20:11:51	@Espyo	the dark defaults you see... on CoC10 with the SS
2016-06-03 20:11:54	@Espyo	that HAS to be it!
2016-06-03 20:12:00	@Espyo	also boo, no Gatling Groink shots
2016-06-03 20:12:04	@Espyo	there has to be something else
2016-06-03 20:12:16	@Espyo	eh, guess not...
2016-06-03 20:12:19	Scruffy	I'm checking if you end the day right when the shot explodes
2016-06-03 20:12:24	Scruffy	On your Pikmin
2016-06-03 20:12:27	@Espyo	right
2016-06-03 20:12:34	@Espyo	both P1 and P3 have a glitch at the end of the day
2016-06-03 20:12:35	Marty2000	Ok, Espyo
2016-06-03 20:12:40	@Espyo	that makes the Pikmin do something else other than get in
2016-06-03 20:12:41	Marty2000	This is the map for sublevel 8
2016-06-03 20:12:43	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1464981147-map-sub-8.png
2016-06-03 20:12:44	Marty2000	A normal map
2016-06-03 20:12:45	@Espyo	if P2 could have that too, that'd be awesome
2016-06-03 20:12:48	@Espyo	wait, sublevel EIGHT?
2016-06-03 20:12:53	@Espyo	I thought we were on about sublevel NINE
2016-06-03 20:12:55	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1464981163-sub-9.png This is sublevel 9
2016-06-03 20:13:08	Marty2000	And this is the odd map for sublevel 9
2016-06-03 20:13:10	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1464981145-map-sub-9.png
2016-06-03 20:13:18	Marty2000	It's not right...
2016-06-03 20:13:21	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-03 20:13:41	@Espyo	woah...
2016-06-03 20:14:32	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Treasure_in_the_background I have a pic for it
2016-06-03 20:14:38	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/GPVP01-1.png mine
2016-06-03 20:14:43	Marty2000	Somehow, it seems to happen after rotating the treasure a lot
2016-06-03 20:14:50	Marty2000	I see....
2016-06-03 20:14:52	@Espyo	hm, weird
2016-06-03 20:14:59	@Espyo	but anyway, I'll check the texture files in a bit
2016-06-03 20:15:04	@Espyo	first, I'm going to science CoC10 some more
2016-06-03 20:15:05	Marty2000	Can you try with the JPN version, please? If you can
2016-06-03 20:15:12	Marty2000	Okay, no problem
2016-06-03 20:15:14	Scruffy	Is there a way to advance one frame at a time in Dolphin?
2016-06-03 20:15:20	@Espyo	try \
2016-06-03 20:15:22	@Espyo	or uh...
2016-06-03 20:15:27	@Espyo	well, whatever key is to the left of 1
2016-06-03 20:15:30	@Espyo	tilde?
2016-06-03 20:15:37	UltraMario	\
2016-06-03 20:15:40	@Espyo	anyway, that's where I have my frame advance, and I THINK that that's where it's at by default
2016-06-03 20:15:47	@Espyo	if not, check the settings
2016-06-03 20:15:48	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1464981327-miniature-right.jpg
2016-06-03 20:15:54	@Espyo	if you don't have it, your Dolphin is too old :V
2016-06-03 20:15:58	Marty2000	The miniature can also appears at the left
2016-06-03 20:16:04	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-06-03 20:16:28	Scruffy	My hotkey settings are weird, they don't work every time I boot Dolphin
2016-06-03 20:16:34	Marty2000	I could get a miniature at the left with the chess pieces
2016-06-03 20:16:47	Scruffy	And if I change them, even save them, they always reset to the default
2016-06-03 20:16:58	Scruffy	in which there's no frame advance
2016-06-03 20:17:09	@Espyo	that's messed up
2016-06-03 20:17:12	@Espyo	is your Dolphin up-to-date?
2016-06-03 20:17:20	@Espyo	you and Marty should compare versions
2016-06-03 20:17:32	Marty2000	4.0.2 for me
2016-06-03 20:17:34	@Espyo	mine's been compiled from source, so it's like version 4.jumble
2016-06-03 20:17:41	Marty2000	I cannot get higher versions because of my computer
2016-06-03 20:17:50	@Espyo	hey Marty
2016-06-03 20:17:56	@Espyo	have you tried using free cam while delivering a treasure?
2016-06-03 20:18:01	@Espyo	the "miniature" might be there, off-screen
2016-06-03 20:18:06	Scruffy	4.0-8291
2016-06-03 20:18:11	Marty2000	I haven't
2016-06-03 20:18:34	@Espyo	give it a try
2016-06-03 20:18:41	@Espyo	ok, we're doing a LOT of things at once right now... let's reiterate
2016-06-03 20:18:46	Scruffy	I'll update, but for now I've successfully paused on an explosion
2016-06-03 20:18:48	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-03 20:18:50	@Espyo	I'm trying to unmask the secrets of CoC10
2016-06-03 20:19:07	Scruffy	And Pikmin have successfully been killed during the explosion
2016-06-03 20:19:12	@Espyo	you're trying to figure out what's up with the map on DD9
2016-06-03 20:19:23	@Espyo	Scruffy's figuring out if he can manipulate the sunset cutscene
2016-06-03 20:19:32	@Espyo	ooh, nice
2016-06-03 20:19:44	@Espyo	but it's not really interrupting the Pikmin midway through, is it?
2016-06-03 20:19:45	Marty2000	Yeah, but someone will have to check the map with the JPN version later
2016-06-03 20:19:47	Scruffy	It killed 8
2016-06-03 20:19:50	Marty2000	to see whether it's me or the JPN version
2016-06-03 20:19:57	@Espyo	ok, I'll point it down here to check later
2016-06-03 20:20:04	Scruffy	And it knew why: because of explosion
2016-06-03 20:20:23	@Espyo	cool
2016-06-03 20:20:26	Scruffy	Because they contacted the explosion /during/ the day, when you're playing
2016-06-03 20:20:32	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:20:53	Scruffy	But these Blue Pikmin somehow contacted the fire during the cutscene, when the game no longer keeps track of how Pikmin die except for those left behind
2016-06-03 20:21:31	Scruffy	I still have no idea how, the fire wasn't in their path at all
2016-06-03 20:21:32	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:21:45	Scruffy	And only two of them got burned
2016-06-03 20:23:52	@Espyo	hmm, my file version theory didn't quite work out
2016-06-03 20:27:07	@Espyo	pretty weird stuff here...
2016-06-03 20:27:12	-->	CreativeSushi (Mibbit@vmwn-295-3-88-94.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-03 20:27:22	@Espyo	I removed the second set
2016-06-03 20:27:25	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-03 20:27:28	@Espyo	and changed the version to 0
2016-06-03 20:27:32	@Espyo	so it should behave like CoC10
2016-06-03 20:27:38	@Espyo	in that the Solar System makes it so much different
2016-06-03 20:27:41	@Espyo	but it's the same
2016-06-03 20:27:47	CreativeSushi	heyo
2016-06-03 20:27:54	CreativeSushi	Hows the gang
2016-06-03 20:28:02	Scruffy	Hi CreativeSushi!
2016-06-03 20:28:09	<--	Klemen702 (Mibbit@86.61.jwq.jv) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-06-03 20:28:12	CreativeSushi	Hey Scruffy
2016-06-03 20:28:15	@Espyo	AGH
2016-06-03 20:28:21	@Espyo	I must've done SOMETHING
2016-06-03 20:28:32	@Espyo	since looking down at the floor directly makes it REALLY bright
2016-06-03 20:28:40	@Espyo	all awesome here, man
2016-06-03 20:28:45	@Espyo	we're doing Pikmin 2 science
2016-06-03 20:28:59	Scruffy	does your light.ini have two sets of light parameters, each with the same names?
2016-06-03 20:29:01	Scruffy	Mine only has one
2016-06-03 20:29:08	CreativeSushi	Oh yeah? messing with params
2016-06-03 20:29:13	@Espyo	oh, I mean I was editing tutorial_1_light.ini
2016-06-03 20:29:27	CreativeSushi	Did you see the bug I posted on skype today epsyo
2016-06-03 20:29:31	CreativeSushi	I don't think its on the wiki
2016-06-03 20:29:36	Marty2000	Hi CreativeSushi
2016-06-03 20:29:39	@Espyo	yeah, one of you back at the wikia discovered that Cavern of Chaos 10 is actually DARKER with the Solar System
2016-06-03 20:29:45	@Espyo	and we're just messing about trying to figure out why, exactly
2016-06-03 20:29:50	@Espyo	I haven't, sorry
2016-06-03 20:29:53	@Espyo	haven't booted skype in forever
2016-06-03 20:29:56	CreativeSushi	Hey marty
2016-06-03 20:29:57	@Espyo	really wish you guys would use Discord...

2016-06-03 20:30:08	CreativeSushi	I do use discord
2016-06-03 20:30:11	CreativeSushi	I wish the same thing
2016-06-03 20:30:12	@Espyo	I'll turn it on now and leave it on for the weekend
2016-06-03 20:30:16	@Espyo	ace
2016-06-03 20:30:22	CreativeSushi	Is there a Pikmin discord chat?
2016-06-03 20:30:29	@Espyo	everybody that tries Discord agrees that they should leave skype
2016-06-03 20:30:32	@Espyo	there isn't, we never made it
2016-06-03 20:30:32	Scruffy	Our current theory is that the light file for Cavern of Chaos 10 is it's an earlier version
2016-06-03 20:30:40	CreativeSushi	Because I've tried convincing luther tommy and josh
2016-06-03 20:30:49	@Espyo	Luther refuses most of the time
2016-06-03 20:30:51	CreativeSushi	luther seemed to want to switch at one point
2016-06-03 20:30:52	@Espyo	Tommy and Josh are on the fence
2016-06-03 20:30:55	@Espyo	oh, did he?
2016-06-03 20:31:02	CreativeSushi	yeah
2016-06-03 20:31:10	@Espyo	we really have to try to make it happen
2016-06-03 20:31:18	CreativeSushi	Yeah
2016-06-03 20:31:22	@Espyo	it won't reall-- AAAGGGH
2016-06-03 20:31:28	CreativeSushi	We can so so many better likes like
2016-06-03 20:31:28	@Espyo	A SKYPE WINDOW JUST POPPED UP IN FRONT OF ME
2016-06-03 20:31:33	CreativeSushi	NOT have bugs
2016-06-03 20:31:35	@Espyo	I was TYPING, but NOOOO
2016-06-03 20:31:43	@Espyo	yeah, no annoying dialogs popping up
2016-06-03 20:31:48	@Espyo	not being a resource hog
2016-06-03 20:31:50	@Espyo	anyway...
2016-06-03 20:31:54	CreativeSushi	And a seperate channel if someone wants to post something NSFW
2016-06-03 20:31:55	@Espyo	it won't really replace this IRC chat
2016-06-03 20:32:02	CreativeSushi	right
2016-06-03 20:32:09	@Espyo	but it should at least be useful for voice chat and such, especially with those guys
2016-06-03 20:32:14	@Espyo	they love voice chatting like every day
2016-06-03 20:32:14	En_Passant	There's a Pikmin Speedrunning Discord
2016-06-03 20:32:18	@Espyo	yeah ^
2016-06-03 20:32:21	CreativeSushi	Does discord have a html extension?
2016-06-03 20:32:28	CreativeSushi	Ooooh someone needs to invite me to that
2016-06-03 20:32:28	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2016-06-03 20:32:38	CreativeSushi	For instance, I put the livechat on the forums
2016-06-03 20:32:41	CreativeSushi	a widget
2016-06-03 20:32:45	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-03 20:32:48	@Espyo	hm, I don't think it does
2016-06-03 20:32:51	@Espyo	Mibbit does, though
2016-06-03 20:32:55	@Espyo	[[Special:WebChat]]
2016-06-03 20:32:55	Testyo	"Special:WebChat" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:WebChat
2016-06-03 20:33:05	CreativeSushi	yeah that how I got it on the forums
2016-06-03 20:33:16	@Espyo	oh, didn't realize you already did
2016-06-03 20:33:17	@Espyo	my bad
2016-06-03 20:33:21	@Espyo	hm, I didn't receive anything from you
2016-06-03 20:34:24	CreativeSushi	yup http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/page/chatroom
2016-06-03 20:34:30	CreativeSushi	oh and that bug
2016-06-03 20:34:47	CreativeSushi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkMQF6no3X4
2016-06-03 20:34:53	CreativeSushi	HSS0136 posted this
2016-06-03 20:34:55	@Espyo	yeah, he uploaded that today
2016-06-03 20:34:59	@Espyo	saw it too
2016-06-03 20:35:01	Yoshi2	discord does have a web client, though not something you can embed on a page
2016-06-03 20:35:05	CreativeSushi	Oh alright
2016-06-03 20:35:07	@Espyo	yeah ^
2016-06-03 20:35:09	CreativeSushi	is that bug on the forums?
2016-06-03 20:35:13	@Espyo	don't think it is
2016-06-03 20:35:19	@Espyo	but we don't usually share bugs, right?
2016-06-03 20:35:32	CreativeSushi	I mean wiki XD
2016-06-03 20:35:36	@Espyo	oh lol
2016-06-03 20:35:36	CreativeSushi	oops
2016-06-03 20:35:40	@Espyo	not yet, but it will be
2016-06-03 20:35:45	@Espyo	if somebody here wants to try to reproduce it
2016-06-03 20:35:47	CreativeSushi	Well technically any website can be embedded
2016-06-03 20:35:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:36:00	CreativeSushi	I could embed youtube onto the forums if I wanted to
2016-06-03 20:36:18	@Espyo	ok, I seriously don't get what's going on with this lighting file
2016-06-03 20:36:26	@Espyo	I set it to version 0, removed its second set of parameters
2016-06-03 20:36:28	Yoshi2	you could do anything using iframes or something like that
2016-06-03 20:36:30	@Espyo	entered without the SS
2016-06-03 20:36:31	Yoshi2	but at that point
2016-06-03 20:36:36	Yoshi2	just link directly to the website
2016-06-03 20:36:36	@Espyo	and it's just burning my retinas with how bright it is
2016-06-03 20:36:38	CreativeSushi	but that obviously wouldn't be practical, it depends on how the website is organized. So if discords web chat would fit I could put it on
2016-06-03 20:36:52	@Espyo	I don't quite think it fits, no
2016-06-03 20:37:26	@Espyo	wow, it really is a gradual change, Marty2000
2016-06-03 20:37:34	@Espyo	I'm using codes to add and remove the Solar System
2016-06-03 20:37:41	Marty2000	See
2016-06-03 20:37:42	@Espyo	and it changes gradually, over what, 3 seconds?
2016-06-03 20:37:45	@Espyo	GC, btw
2016-06-03 20:37:51	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 20:37:52	@Espyo	cool, needs to be added
2016-06-03 20:37:56	@Espyo	I'll add it
2016-06-03 20:37:59	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-03 20:39:59	En_Passant	hey, that was posted in the discord, too
2016-06-03 20:40:09	Marty2000	Ah, by the way, Espyo
2016-06-03 20:40:19	@Espyo	yep, they love HSS0136
2016-06-03 20:40:20	Marty2000	There are strange things with the walking animations of Winged Pikmin
2016-06-03 20:40:29	@Espyo	didn't realize you were on that chat too, En_Passant
2016-06-03 20:40:29	Marty2000	For example....
2016-06-03 20:40:34	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/a/a3/Winged-Pikmin-walking.jpeg
2016-06-03 20:40:35	@Espyo	hm
2016-06-03 20:40:48	Marty2000	Here, they are considered like other walking Pikmin
2016-06-03 20:40:54	Marty2000	But here...
2016-06-03 20:40:55	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/f0/Montage_Winged_fire.png
2016-06-03 20:41:12	Marty2000	Even when running, they can run over water or run above ground
2016-06-03 20:41:21	Marty2000	If they're supposed to fall, they don't 
2016-06-03 20:41:29	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-03 20:41:34	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-03 20:41:44	@Espyo	that might just be an universal "run while panicking on fire" animation
2016-06-03 20:41:48	Marty2000	Yoshi2 told me it could be because tey supposed to have the ability to traverse some kind of terrains
2016-06-03 20:41:54	@Espyo	so it's just an animation change, even though they're still physically flying
2016-06-03 20:41:58	Marty2000	I'll have to take a video
2016-06-03 20:42:08	Marty2000	I already know how to make it run while burning
2016-06-03 20:42:11	Marty2000	That's easy
2016-06-03 20:42:22	Marty2000	I'll have to make it happen close to water
2016-06-03 20:42:29	Marty2000	they*
2016-06-03 20:42:52	Marty2000	Yeah, that's probably it
2016-06-03 20:43:04	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/a/a3/Winged-Pikmin-walking.jpeg Not for this, though
2016-06-03 20:43:29	Marty2000	They can be pushed and fall into water
2016-06-03 20:43:35	Marty2000	(with that animation only)
2016-06-03 20:43:36	@Espyo	right
2016-06-03 20:43:43	Yoshi2	Espyo: suprisingly, in some cases they seem to be following the walking pikmin AI
2016-06-03 20:44:12	Marty2000	Yep, when there is no specific path for them to take in the air (at least that's what I think)
2016-06-03 20:44:24	@Espyo	seems about right
2016-06-03 20:44:41	Marty2000	Normally, they're not supposed to build that bridge, so it would make sense to not create a path for them
2016-06-03 20:45:09	Marty2000	I really have to try on other maps with the spicy berries, since we can move them...
2016-06-03 20:45:13	CreativeSushi	Someone should skype me a link to join the discord
2016-06-03 20:45:13	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:45:15	Marty2000	They also take the closest path
2016-06-03 20:45:18	CreativeSushi	Also I am now aware that
2016-06-03 20:45:26	@Espyo	CreativeSushi: I don't know if they're selective with the people they let in
2016-06-03 20:45:31	@Espyo	I don't think it's a public group
2016-06-03 20:45:41	CreativeSushi	Oh alright
2016-06-03 20:45:53	@Espyo	I can ask anyway, though
2016-06-03 20:45:57	CreativeSushi	Anyway, I can definitely embed a Discord
2016-06-03 20:46:01	CreativeSushi	onto a page
2016-06-03 20:46:04	@Espyo	you can? cool
2016-06-03 20:46:04	CreativeSushi	on the forums or wiki
2016-06-03 20:46:04	Marty2000	So, if there is a path in the air for them to take... but the closest path is for walking Pikmin only, they'll take the latter
2016-06-03 20:46:09	En_Passant	I don't run and I was allowed in, so you should be fine
2016-06-03 20:46:19	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-03 20:46:24	CreativeSushi	Better than that, we can have multiple channels
2016-06-03 20:46:25	@Espyo	yeah, guess they can let anybody in then
2016-06-03 20:46:33	@Espyo	yeah, we can have multiple ones
2016-06-03 20:46:40	@Espyo	though I'm wondering just how we'd do it for the Pikipedia folk
2016-06-03 20:46:43	CreativeSushi	so if a guest joins they just go in default chat
2016-06-03 20:46:47	@Espyo	I mean, on skype, everybody talks about their personal life
2016-06-03 20:46:51	@Espyo	wouldn't really look for a public channel
2016-06-03 20:46:59	CreativeSushi	well we make another channel for them and call it pikipedia legacy or just another server
2016-06-03 20:47:02	@Espyo	*wouldn't really work
2016-06-03 20:47:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:47:24	@Espyo	though I was thinking we should make a Discord group just for the current skype people
2016-06-03 20:47:28	@Espyo	just so we can get out of that damned hell hole
2016-06-03 20:47:33	CreativeSushi	But thats exactly what we need to bridge the gap between the "People who run pikipedia" and the community 
2016-06-03 20:47:33	@Espyo	and regular Pikminness still happens here
2016-06-03 20:47:41	@Espyo	it should be the same either way for non-registered users
2016-06-03 20:47:48	@Espyo	that's also true
2016-06-03 20:47:54	@Espyo	we can have the channels on one server
2016-06-03 20:47:57	CreativeSushi	also true
2016-06-03 20:47:59	@Espyo	and make one of the channels invite-only
2016-06-03 20:48:17	@Espyo	that way everybody is on the same server, but only the oldschool skype folk can enter the private chat
2016-06-03 20:48:24	@Espyo	though I'm not sure what to do about the IRC
2016-06-03 20:48:27	@Espyo	it's still soon to decide
2016-06-03 20:48:31	@Espyo	but it's NOT soon to get the hell out of skype, ugh
2016-06-03 20:48:39	CreativeSushi	right
2016-06-03 20:48:46	<--	Chiaki_Nanami (Pi@59-995-323-88-lr28.tbcn.telia.com) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-06-03 20:49:11	CreativeSushi	I would love to switch IRC over to discord. I can embed it, anyone can join, all you need is a username, it has all the same benifits as IRC with so many more
2016-06-03 20:49:21	CreativeSushi	easier to manage too really 
2016-06-03 20:49:29	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-03 20:49:48	@Espyo	but I think it's still early because a) Discord is still growing, and we should keep an eye out for them
2016-06-03 20:49:52	@Espyo	they're an awesome service... for now
2016-06-03 20:49:56	@Espyo	they could decide to go full wikia on us
2016-06-03 20:50:01	@Espyo	"hey, we're implementing an ad-based layout"
2016-06-03 20:50:05	@Espyo	"uhm, this layout sucks"
2016-06-03 20:50:07	@Espyo	"TOO BAD"
2016-06-03 20:50:13	CreativeSushi	Yeah, until they start charging for use 
2016-06-03 20:50:19	CreativeSushi	and all kinds of crap
2016-06-03 20:50:24	@Espyo	whereas in IRC, that doesn't happen, because it's just a "protocol" for talking, mostly
2016-06-03 20:50:25	@Espyo	not a site
2016-06-03 20:50:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:50:33	@Espyo	and b) I'll have to think about porting Testyo
2016-06-03 20:50:33	Testyo	...uh, except I can't, because replays are broken in the name
2016-06-03 20:50:44	@Espyo	he's a great tool over here, besides being just the town jester
2016-06-03 20:50:48	@Espyo	he reports recent changes on the wiki

2016-06-03 20:51:09	CreativeSushi	Well bots are most certainly an option on discord 
2016-06-03 20:51:12	CreativeSushi	I know a guy
2016-06-03 20:51:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:51:21	@Espyo	but I'm not sure how easy it'd be to develop for them
2016-06-03 20:51:21	Marty2000	Testyo will still be better than PikBot :p
2016-06-03 20:51:22	Testyo	if i fail ill just do a hypocrite
2016-06-03 20:51:26	@Espyo	plus if I can just port Testyo around
2016-06-03 20:51:26	Testyo	yeah seem to be able to go as narrow
2016-06-03 20:51:28	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-03 20:52:11	CreativeSushi	Well I have a friend who has developed discord bots for me in the past, I'm sure he could help with any questions you might have in case you plan to do that
2016-06-03 20:52:19	@Espyo	ooh, sweet
2016-06-03 20:52:21	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-03 20:52:28	CreativeSushi	yep
2016-06-03 20:52:39	@Espyo	really weird...
2016-06-03 20:52:46	@Espyo	I just ported light.ini entirely to tutorial_1_light.ini
2016-06-03 20:52:53	@Espyo	and the with-SS lighting seems the same
2016-06-03 20:52:57	@Espyo	but the without-SS lighting freaks out
2016-06-03 20:53:00	@Espyo	it's super bright and weird
2016-06-03 20:53:03	@Espyo	maybe...
2016-06-03 20:53:11	@Espyo	since there is no without-SS lighting data...
2016-06-03 20:53:14	@Espyo	it just uses garbage data
2016-06-03 20:53:23	@Espyo	but I don't think that's it, since this looks like really specific brightness
2016-06-03 20:53:26	@Espyo	if it were a random color, than totally
2016-06-03 20:53:31	Yoshi2	Espyo: going full wikia would kill discord imo
2016-06-03 20:53:41	@Espyo	it should've killed wikia
2016-06-03 20:53:43	@Espyo	and it didn't...
2016-06-03 20:54:00	Yoshi2	well, how many services are there that let you host entire wikis for free?
2016-06-03 20:54:12	@Espyo	the Discord folk seem cool, but I'm still keeping an eye on them
2016-06-03 20:54:24	@Espyo	a small handful
2016-06-03 20:54:44	CreativeSushi	they are certainty intelligent folks as well
2016-06-03 20:55:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:55:12	@Espyo	don't like how they meme the hell out of everything though :|
2016-06-03 20:55:25	Yoshi2	with discord, at least moving away from it should be much easier than with wikia
2016-06-03 20:55:34	@Espyo	can I please read the changelog without getting DAT BOI'd everywhere? please, you're sounding like Nintendo of America...
2016-06-03 20:55:34	CreativeSushi	well, to be honest your probably in the minority 
2016-06-03 20:55:42	CreativeSushi	but yes I agree
2016-06-03 20:55:43	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 20:55:45	@Espyo	people love their memes
2016-06-03 20:55:52	@Espyo	could they at least try to be a bit smarter with them? eesh
2016-06-03 20:55:52	Yoshi2	so if they do go full wikia, the fallout shouldn't be as bad as with wikia
2016-06-03 20:55:59	@Espyo	Yoshi2: that's for sure
2016-06-03 20:56:00	@Espyo	luckily
2016-06-03 20:58:48	@Espyo	aha!
2016-06-03 20:58:52	@Espyo	my theory about the file version WAS right
2016-06-03 20:58:59	@Espyo	I kept the original file this time, but only changed its version
2016-06-03 20:59:09	@Espyo	and sure enough, if I remove the Solar System, it goes back to that blinding white
2016-06-03 20:59:17	@Espyo	but why does this cave go white and others don't?
2016-06-03 20:59:23	@Espyo	I'll mess around with the values
2016-06-03 20:59:34	@Espyo	maybe the non-SS values depend on the SS ones, in format version 0000
2016-06-03 20:59:50	@Espyo	wait, I know that's not the case
2016-06-03 20:59:53	Yoshi2	the version matters?
2016-06-03 20:59:56	@Espyo	since I already replaced that file with light.ini
2016-06-03 20:59:58	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-03 21:00:10	@Espyo	version 0000 was made back at the start of development
2016-06-03 21:00:13	@Espyo	it just contains lighting data
2016-06-03 21:00:31	@Espyo	 0001 has parameters for when you do and don't have the Solar System
2016-06-03 21:01:36	Yoshi2	ah, that makes sense
2016-06-03 21:04:23	@Espyo	hmm, I think I see what's up
2016-06-03 21:04:34	@Espyo	if there are no non-SS values, it just uses some defaults
2016-06-03 21:04:49	@Espyo	it's just that on Emergence Cave 1 those defaults make your eyes bleed
2016-06-03 21:04:54	@Espyo	not so much the case in Emergence Cave 2
2016-06-03 21:05:15	@Espyo	I'll see if it also has default values for yes-SS
2016-06-03 21:05:49	En_Passant	It has different defaults for different levels?
2016-06-03 21:05:58	@Espyo	maybe it does
2016-06-03 21:06:10	@Espyo	or it uses some leftover data from elsewhere
2016-06-03 21:06:19	@Espyo	otherwise I can't see why EC1 and EC2 are so different
2016-06-03 21:06:22	@Espyo	well, not SO different
2016-06-03 21:06:28	@Espyo	but EC1 is really hard on the eyes

2016-06-03 21:06:58	@Espyo	oh yeah, it uses the same defaults for yes-SS and no-SS
2016-06-03 21:07:28	@Espyo	or maybe it depends on the size of the sublevel?
2016-06-03 21:08:31	@Espyo	well, I'll try messing around with other lighting settings
2016-06-03 21:09:12	@Espyo	woah, okay
2016-06-03 21:09:23	@Espyo	version 0000 uses default values if they're not defined
2016-06-03 21:09:27	@Espyo	version 0001 DOESN'T
2016-06-03 21:09:41	@Espyo	if you say this file's format is version 0001, and don't specify values
2016-06-03 21:09:43	@Espyo	it WILL blow up
2016-06-03 21:10:03	@Espyo	they might've added a failsafe to the version 0000 reader for safety reasons
2016-06-03 21:10:21	@Espyo	 0001 might've been done more carefully, but they knew they left some 0000 files somewhere, so better safe than sorry
2016-06-03 21:10:26	@Espyo	since those files don't have non-SS data
2016-06-03 21:12:42	@Espyo	oh, there's an even earlier format
2016-06-03 21:12:50	@Espyo	it's used on the unused light settings for Olimar and Louie
2016-06-03 21:12:54	@Espyo	( https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2#Unused_Lighting )
2016-06-03 21:13:03	@Espyo	this one doesn't even have a version setting
2016-06-03 21:13:12	@Espyo	of course, they just assumed they'd only need one version and be done with it
2016-06-03 21:14:43	@Espyo	hm, the only other version 0000 files are seemingly unused
2016-06-03 21:14:47	@Espyo	I can't see where they belong
2016-06-03 21:16:17	@Espyo	yep, all unused
2016-06-03 21:16:27	@Espyo	but not on TCRF

2016-06-03 21:31:15	@Espyo	ok, I think I can conclude that the defaults the game uses just look jarring on snowy sublevels because they're so white
2016-06-03 21:31:21	@Espyo	and the whiteness around them burns it higher
2016-06-03 21:31:29	@Espyo	this doesn't happen on Emergence Cave 2 because...
2016-06-03 21:31:40	@Espyo	well, I don't know if the game uses the surrounding surfaces to decide the light
2016-06-03 21:31:48	@Espyo	if it does, that would explain it, since most of that sublevel is dirt, not snow
2016-06-03 21:31:56	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-03 21:31:57	@Espyo	it could also be that each sublevel has some material properties attached to it
2016-06-03 21:32:05	@Espyo	and for EC2 they set it to mostly brown, like dirt
2016-06-03 21:32:20	@Espyo	that's why the defaults aren't as jarring on EC2, but they are everywhere else that lighting is used
2016-06-03 21:32:30	@Espyo	which is EC1, Subterranean Complex 1, and Frontier Cavern uh...
2016-06-03 21:32:33	@Espyo	 5 and 6, I think
2016-06-03 21:32:41	@Espyo	I tested them all
2016-06-03 21:33:11	@Espyo	so yeah, that settles that!

2016-06-03 21:36:52	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/4/45/Sublevel_10_Cavern_Of_Chaos_without_bulb.jpg you can still kinda see that it's a really strong light
2016-06-03 21:37:01	@Espyo	all the whites are pretty strong
2016-06-03 21:37:27	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 21:38:19	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Burrowing_Snagret#Stats In the Garden of Hope Remix, I think it should have around 1250HP
2016-06-03 21:38:23	Marty2000	(at least one of them)
2016-06-03 21:39:10	@Espyo	that seems likely
2016-06-03 21:39:13	@Espyo	can't check, because no DLC

2016-06-03 21:40:34	@Espyo	did you ever figure out what's up with the floating treasure during the cutscene?
2016-06-03 21:41:00	Marty2000	The floating treasure?
2016-06-03 21:41:11	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Treasure_in_the_background yeah
2016-06-03 21:41:52	Marty2000	No, I don't know why this happens... I can only teel you that I remember having that with some treasure in the Frontier Cavern and Cavern of Chaos
2016-06-03 21:42:03	Marty2000	In the Frontier Cavern , the miniature would appear on the left side
2016-06-03 21:42:19	Marty2000	while in the Cavern of Chaos, it would only ppaear on the right side
2016-06-03 21:42:26	Marty2000	And it only happens with certain treasures...
2016-06-03 21:42:35	Marty2000	I think you can see that in some of Mile's speedruns
2016-06-03 21:44:55	Marty2000	I'm checking my reminder...
2016-06-03 21:45:08	Marty2000	We have to add our information about [[Maturity]]

2016-06-03 22:22:31	Marty2000	Hmm... another useless thing I noticed but is hard to explain without video because basically, I need to describe sounds... Well, I hope you will understand. In Pikmin 2, when you're moving with Pikmin, sometimes they make sounds (one with 3 musical notes, another one with 6 musical notes)
2016-06-03 22:22:48	Marty2000	And actually, they play the one with 3 musical notes if there are treasure in the area/sublevel
2016-06-03 22:22:59	Marty2000	And once there's no treasue, they will play the one with 6 musical notes

2016-06-03 22:33:06	CreativeSushi	and while this is no higher resolution it is sharper
2016-06-03 22:33:32	@Espyo	looks the same to me
2016-06-03 22:33:44	@Espyo	well, I don't really remember the old one

2016-06-03 22:48:17	Marty2000	I don't know what causes that glitch
2016-06-03 22:48:26	@Espyo	emulator problem, most likely
2016-06-03 22:48:31	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-03 22:48:46	@Espyo	yeah, those are the sounds I was thinking about
2016-06-03 22:48:54	@Espyo	but wow, I had no idea they play with those rules
2016-06-03 22:49:39	Marty2000	He he, lots of things seem to not be random in Pikmin.

2016-06-03 22:49:58	@Espyo	this game has a lot more detail than we thought
2016-06-03 22:50:17	Marty2000	True
2016-06-03 23:11:14	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/WxWIvaD2XQI?t=1m18s While in the final game, a Whiptongue Bulborb releases any Pikmin caught in its tongue if it's hit in the eye, it wouldn't do so in an early version of P3... funny....
2016-06-03 23:15:09	@Espyo	hm, I'm reading the NPC!P1 Portuguese site, and most of the keywords aren't translated
2016-06-03 23:15:16	@Espyo	Bomb Rock, Bulborb...
2016-06-03 23:15:30	@Espyo	although others are, like Onion, even though they aren't on the manual
2016-06-03 23:15:48	Marty2000	Yeah, I saw that yesterday... only Pikmin 3 is translated
2016-06-03 23:15:51	@Espyo	hmmm, yeah
2016-06-03 23:15:51	Marty2000	Maybe P2
2016-06-03 23:15:55	Marty2000	Same for the Dutch site

2016-06-03 23:19:57	@Espyo	right, I was thinking of adding it to the Enemies section too
2016-06-03 23:20:02	@Espyo	but I don't think this is an enemy change per se
2016-06-03 23:20:05	@Espyo	it's a mechanic change
2016-06-03 23:20:22	@Espyo	I doubt they implemented the eye flinch mechanic on other Bulborbs and forgot this one
2016-06-03 23:20:31	@Espyo	they more likely just didn't implement the mechanic yet entirely

2016-06-03 23:22:12	Marty2000	After being thrown away by the Peckish Aristocrab, the Rock Pikmin didn't start drowning
2016-06-03 23:22:28	@Espyo	huh, weird
2016-06-03 23:22:47	@Espyo	hmmm... it might not be on the water at all
2016-06-03 23:23:40	Marty2000	If a Pikmin lands here in the final ersion, it instantly starts drowning

2016-06-03 23:28:49	@Espyo	that's not right

2016-06-03 23:29:23	@Espyo	which is not true
2016-06-03 23:29:31	@Espyo	the game keeps track of the best single player runs and best co-op runs

2016-06-04 12:19:01	Marty2000	There are more Candypop Buds of that species in this area
2016-06-04 12:19:04	Marty2000	I'll try the others
2016-06-04 12:19:13	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-04 12:19:20	@Espyo	okay
2016-06-04 12:19:42	Marty2000	There's a second one with the same properties
2016-06-04 12:19:46	Marty2000	10 is the max cap :p
2016-06-04 12:19:56	Marty2000	I wonder if throwing Pikmin of the same colour would affect it
2016-06-04 12:20:00	Marty2000	Probably not
2016-06-04 12:20:06	Marty2000	But well, it should be tried
2016-06-04 12:21:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-04 12:23:45	Marty2000	Another trivia thing: Rock Pikmin do not bounce if thrown on a lily pad
2016-06-04 12:25:20	Marty2000	Ok, throwing Pikmin of the same colour do not affect its cap
2016-06-04 12:25:29	Marty2000	same type*
2016-06-04 12:28:15	Marty2000	I wonder if this happens in other levels... I guess it does
2016-06-04 12:29:20	@Espyo	ah

2016-06-04 12:34:39	Marty2000	Can the "some instances of objects can change the parameters" modify the territory radius as well?
2016-06-04 12:34:57	Marty2000	Or the distance at which a creature can notice the Pikmin?
2016-06-04 12:35:46	Marty2000	Because I feel like it's the case...
2016-06-04 12:40:37	Marty2000	I found a case where a Winged Pikmin tries to attack an enemy without flying (Beastly Caverns)
2016-06-04 12:40:47	Marty2000	With a Skitter Leaf
2016-06-04 12:41:34	Marty2000	If you throw a Winged Pikmin next to a Skitter Leaf, it will attack it by flying, but if the Pikmin is thrown away, it will try to re-attack the Skitter Leaf by running
2016-06-04 12:42:17	Marty2000	I guess it's because the Winged Pikmin touched the ground and so he was given similar properties to those of walking Pikmin... but I can't really say that because I don't know much to be honest
2016-06-04 12:47:00	@Espyo	yeah, it can modify territory too
2016-06-04 12:47:05	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-04 12:58:55	Yoshi2	Espyo: I asked einstein again today and he told me I pinged him about that 2-3 times already
2016-06-04 12:58:59	Yoshi2	soo he got my message
2016-06-04 13:00:35	@Espyo	|:
2016-06-04 13:00:39	@Espyo	what else did he say?
2016-06-04 13:01:40	Yoshi2	not much
2016-06-04 13:01:57	Yoshi2	well, I also had a disconnect for 1 minute so maaybe he said something in that time :|
2016-06-04 13:04:04	Yoshi2	I wanted to connect my bouncer to badnik but badnik has no ipv6 support
2016-06-04 13:04:16	Yoshi2	2016 and no ipv6 support, how is this possible

2016-06-04 13:25:07	@Espyo	to be fair, it could just be a permission that was left on the Pikmin wikia exclusively
2016-06-04 13:25:13	@Espyo	...but knowing wikia, that's probably not the case

2016-06-04 14:03:49	Marty2000	(since there are geysers on the way to the fragments, they WILL use their walking animations, it's the same for the lily pads)

2016-06-04 14:07:12	Marty2000	Hmm... I thought there would only be Zelda at the E3...
2016-06-04 14:07:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-04 14:07:26	Marty2000	That's a great series, no doubt about it, but I don't like it
2016-06-04 14:07:36	@Espyo	just ignore that anon, they keep posting that
2016-06-04 14:07:41	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-04 14:08:13	@Espyo	yeah, I'm hyped for the new Zelda, but it's stupid to only focus on it
2016-06-04 14:08:49	Marty2000	I should probably try playing the series more
2016-06-04 14:08:58	Marty2000	FOr example, I detested Pikmin when I got it
2016-06-04 14:09:07	Marty2000	I couldn't play it more than a few minutes, to be honest
2016-06-04 14:09:11	Marty2000	And now, I like it... heh
2016-06-04 14:09:18	Marty2000	So maybe it would be the same for Zelda
2016-06-04 14:09:26	Marty2000	I dunno which game to buy, though...
2016-06-04 14:10:59	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-04 14:11:05	@Espyo	Skyward Sword is my favorite
2016-06-04 14:11:09	@Espyo	but it's very specific
2016-06-04 14:11:14	@Espyo	the motion controls didn't please everybody
2016-06-04 14:11:24	@Espyo	and its linearity and simplicity on some dungeons and puzzles is kinda bad
2016-06-04 14:11:28	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 14:11:30	@Espyo	plus other games had big areas to explore, this one doesn't
2016-06-04 14:11:43	@Espyo	still one of my favorites because of its charm and general direction
2016-06-04 14:11:48	@Espyo	the motion controls were a big plus for me
2016-06-04 14:12:10	@Espyo	they actually worked right, the people who complain are probably the same idiots that wiggle the remote around and expect Link to do exactly the same
2016-06-04 14:15:07	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 14:16:10	@Espyo	if you need a solid, modern Zelda game that most people enjoy, try Wind Waker HD
2016-06-04 14:16:21	@Espyo	navigating through hours of boat rides was a bit of a pain on the GameCube
2016-06-04 14:16:26	@Espyo	but they made it faster on the Wii U, so it's no big deal
2016-06-04 14:16:32	@Espyo	you can also try a 2D Zelda game
2016-06-04 14:16:39	@Espyo	both types use the same concept, but they play so differently
2016-06-04 14:16:47	Marty2000	Okay, thanks :) It was recently released as a Nintendo Select, moreover
2016-06-04 14:16:53	@Espyo	best 2D modern Zelda game is definitely A Link Between Worlds
2016-06-04 14:16:58	@Espyo	oh yeah, it was
2016-06-04 14:16:59	@Espyo	even better
2016-06-04 14:17:10	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 14:17:25	Marty2000	I'll check some Youtube videos later to see what it looks like
2016-06-04 14:17:57	Marty2000	(Off-topic) Hmm... Either it's a big coincidence or it's not random (which I suspect): you can't have both Seeding Dandelions and "normal" Dandelions in the same area
2016-06-04 14:18:07	Marty2000	Either all dandelions are seeding ones or normal ones
2016-06-04 14:18:10	Marty2000	(in P3)
2016-06-04 14:18:49	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-06-04 14:18:54	@Espyo	I don't think it's a limitation at all
2016-06-04 14:18:58	@Espyo	might just be a design choice
2016-06-04 14:19:02	@Espyo	which I guess makes sense

2016-06-04 14:52:24	Scruffy	oh weird
2016-06-04 14:53:20	Scruffy	I figured it was just out of bounds on the platform, but it's actually inside the wall
2016-06-04 14:53:42	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-04 14:54:48	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-04 14:55:04	Scruffy	Hi Marty!
2016-06-04 14:55:28	Marty2000	I know how to get out of bounds here, and you can even see and fall into the abyss... I might record a video for you to see when I'm in the Twilight River
2016-06-04 14:55:47	Scruffy	Woah
2016-06-04 14:56:18	Scruffy	I remember getting out of bounds in the Twilight River, and going up the waterfall where the lily pads come rom
2016-06-04 14:56:19	Scruffy	from*
2016-06-04 14:56:30	Marty2000	Oh, yeah, that's fun too!
2016-06-04 14:56:39	Scruffy	There was one point where you'd try to continue on and suddenly teleport back to the other side of the river
2016-06-04 14:56:59	Scruffy	There's something that resets your location if you try to cross the river
2016-06-04 14:57:06	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-04 14:58:23	Scruffy	Today I finished modeling and rigging all the Pikmin I need for my Pikmin short movie
2016-06-04 14:59:14	@Espyo	ooh, great!
2016-06-04 14:59:19	Marty2000	Nice!
2016-06-04 14:59:21	Scruffy	Thanks! :D
2016-06-04 14:59:28	Scruffy	I just finished with the Blue Pikmin
2016-06-04 14:59:34	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-06-04 14:59:35	Scruffy	I devised a great way to control its mouth
2016-06-04 15:00:13	Scruffy	To make it more like the mouth in the short film, I actually made it a shape that sits on top of the Blue Pikmin, rather than a hole in the Blue Pikmin
2016-06-04 15:00:48	Scruffy	But I have Blender use a special modifier to move the mouth within the local space of the Blue Pikmin's surface
2016-06-04 15:01:26	Scruffy	So I can move the mouth anywhere, and it stays attached to the Blue Pikmin
2016-06-04 15:01:45	Scruffy	Then I just created some rigs to edit its shape
2016-06-04 15:02:03	@Espyo	sweet, but what other ways could there be to make it work if not that?
2016-06-04 15:02:30	Scruffy	I could rig the mouth it had, but it's trickier to keep vertices from running into each other
2016-06-04 15:03:01	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-04 15:04:39	Scruffy	The only issue I have to figure out now is how to get Pikmin eyes to have different pupil shapes
2016-06-04 15:04:55	Scruffy	Like when their pupils are closed, or when they're dazed and their pupils are spirals
2016-06-04 15:05:19	Scruffy	But I think I can either apply a texture or just replace the eyes on the frames that I need them
2016-06-04 15:06:10	Scruffy	by the way, I was wondering, Espyo, if you have the model of the 10 pellet from Pikmin 3
2016-06-04 15:06:24	Scruffy	And if you have the texture of an enemy's ghost from Pikmin 3
2016-06-04 15:06:39	@Espyo	right
2016-06-04 15:06:50	@Espyo	I might be able to get them, no problem
2016-06-04 15:06:55	Scruffy	Great!
2016-06-04 15:07:15	Scruffy	Right now they both make an appearance in this film
2016-06-04 15:30:31	Marty2000	I recorded the sort of abyss for you, Scruffy
2016-06-04 15:30:51	Marty2000	If you need more details, I can get a better video, because we can't see many things in the one I've just recorded
2016-06-04 15:30:53	Marty2000	I'll upload it
2016-06-04 15:32:01	Scruffy	Ah, great!
2016-06-04 15:32:05	Marty2000	Ok, now, back to the Distant Tundra. I skipped the two bridges, and I'll see how the WInged Pikmin act if they're told to build it
2016-06-04 15:32:13	Marty2000	I hope they'll use their walking animations
2016-06-04 15:32:21	Marty2000	And I think they will thanks to the geysers
2016-06-04 15:35:25	Marty2000	!!
2016-06-04 15:36:17	Marty2000	Indeed, they walk
2016-06-04 15:36:22	Marty2000	Great
2016-06-04 15:36:31	Marty2000	At least I haven't lost my time
2016-06-04 15:36:40	Marty2000	They walk thanks to the slide and geysers
2016-06-04 15:36:52	Marty2000	I think I've understood how all those things wor
2016-06-04 15:37:38	Marty2000	Basically, to carry an object and walk, WInged Pikmin need to be set to a "walking" state by using certain things (for example, when they slide, they always walk, same when they are on lily pads, or when they use geysers)
2016-06-04 15:38:02	Marty2000	Normally, they should fly again after using those things...
2016-06-04 15:38:12	Marty2000	but that's not the case if they're carrying something
2016-06-04 15:40:59	Scruffy	Interesting
2016-06-04 15:48:14	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/GcjvpmLRq6U Don't hesitate to ask if you want a better video ;)
2016-06-04 15:49:27	Scruffy	Great!

2016-06-04 15:51:59	Scruffy	It didn't take long at all
2016-06-04 15:52:35	Marty2000	No problem
2016-06-04 15:53:18	Marty2000	Oh, a Splatfest got announced in Splatoon
2016-06-04 15:53:23	Marty2000	I didn't check
2016-06-04 15:54:03	Scruffy	I've gotta go for now, if Espyo finds the pellet model and texture will you let him know I'll be back later
2016-06-04 15:54:12	@Espyo	I've almost got them
2016-06-04 15:54:20	@Espyo	(just got back from something else I was doing)
2016-06-04 15:54:24	Scruffy	Oh okay
2016-06-04 15:54:29	@Espyo	if you can wait 5 minutes, they're yours
2016-06-04 15:54:29	Marty2000	See you soon, Scruffy
2016-06-04 15:54:30	Scruffy	No rush, no problem
2016-06-04 15:54:33	@Espyo	if not, I'll send you when I can
2016-06-04 15:54:36	Scruffy	5 min is fine

2016-06-04 15:59:04	@Espyo	not quite sure if the enemy spirit one exported right
2016-06-04 15:59:08	@Espyo	it gave off some warnings
2016-06-04 16:00:16	Scruffy	I don't think it exported
2016-06-04 16:00:20	Scruffy	It doesn't show up in this folder
2016-06-04 16:00:26	Scruffy	But thank you for the pellet!
2016-06-04 16:01:00	@Espyo	hm?
2016-06-04 16:01:07	@Espyo	you mean you don't have an enemy_ghost.3ds file in there?
2016-06-04 16:01:13	Scruffy	No
2016-06-04 16:01:20	@Espyo	let me try again then
2016-06-04 16:01:32	Scruffy	oh, there it is
2016-06-04 16:01:37	Scruffy	I just had to click the link twice
2016-06-04 16:02:01	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-04 16:02:07	Scruffy	Wooooah
2016-06-04 16:02:17	Scruffy	It's actually a model
2016-06-04 16:02:22	Scruffy	Like, a spherical model
2016-06-04 16:02:29	Scruffy	Not just a plane with a texture on it
2016-06-04 16:02:43	@Espyo	yeah, I was surprised too when I saw that the texture was a load of nothing
2016-06-04 16:03:51	Scruffy	There appear to be two layers to it
2016-06-04 16:04:08	Scruffy	An outer shell and an inner shell, to get the transparency effect across
2016-06-04 16:04:31	Scruffy	Thank you Espyo!
2016-06-04 16:04:37	Scruffy	That'll really help
2016-06-04 16:05:14	@Espyo	you're welcome!

2016-06-04 16:08:02	Marty2000	Hmm, Espyo, I have a question. It's really subjective, but can I add the {{delete}} template to some images if I juge they're "useless" (sorry for saying that)? Like this one http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:158.jpg
2016-06-04 16:08:02	Testyo	"delete" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:delete

2016-06-04 16:11:31	@Espyo	just because the deletion tag is there doesn't mean it will be deleted, so there's no fear of getting rid of good stuff

2016-06-04 17:31:11	Marty2000	Or a separate file?
2016-06-04 17:31:24	@Espyo	a superseded version means a version that got replaced
2016-06-04 17:31:26	@Espyo	so you said it wrong :P
2016-06-04 17:31:30	@Espyo	yeah, just replace it

2016-06-04 17:31:33	@Espyo	we don't need that tiny-resolution image

2016-06-04 17:31:57	@Espyo	when you replace an image
2016-06-04 17:32:03	@Espyo	don't write "superseded" on the notes
2016-06-04 17:32:12	@Espyo	because it's obvious that the image you're replacing is superseded by the new one
2016-06-04 17:32:18	@Espyo	that's the entire point of uploading a replacement
2016-06-04 17:32:22	@Espyo	instead, explain why this replacement is better
2016-06-04 17:32:39	Marty2000	Okay, I'll remember
2016-06-04 17:34:41	Marty2000	I can't upload it because the thumb is a jpg image while my file is a png... If I convert into jpg, I will lose transparency
2016-06-04 17:34:51	@Espyo	oh, yeah...
2016-06-04 17:34:53	@Espyo	new image, then
2016-06-04 17:35:01	@Espyo	and replace all usages of the old one for the new one

2016-06-04 17:35:06	Marty2000	Sure

2016-06-04 18:34:23	@Espyo	...apparently he was not told hard enough on MarioWiki
2016-06-04 18:34:27	@Espyo	he renames images
2016-06-04 18:34:40	@Espyo	which although it's pretty innocuous and his heart is in the right place
2016-06-04 18:34:45	@Espyo	it causes more trouble than not
2016-06-04 18:35:18	@Espyo	since you have to go to every page in which the image is used and change the name there
2016-06-04 18:35:28	@Espyo	we have SO MANY tasks that actually need to be done
2016-06-04 18:35:33	@Espyo	and he's doing something that's causing more harm than good
2016-06-04 18:36:04	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 18:37:53	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-04 18:37:58	@Espyo	he got banned from Mario Wiki for being an idiot
2016-06-04 18:38:03	@Espyo	I think the same will happen here in no time
2016-06-04 18:38:07	Marty2000	Really?
2016-06-04 18:38:30	Marty2000	He's just posted in your talk page
2016-06-04 18:38:59	Marty2000	Yeah, the problem is that you need to replace the image in every article...
2016-06-04 18:39:03	Marty2000	I suppose
2016-06-04 18:39:27	@Espyo	oh, he did?
2016-06-04 18:40:11	Marty2000	And he deleted what he wrote :p
2016-06-04 18:40:23	Marty2000	But you can still see what he wrote thnks to the recent changes
2016-06-04 18:41:15	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-06-04 18:41:21	@Espyo	I'm warning him that he can get banned too
2016-06-04 18:41:31	@Espyo	I won't ban him right away, since that's not fair

2016-06-04 18:41:38	@Espyo	I'll give him a warning and a chance to shape up his act
2016-06-04 18:41:42	@Espyo	if he doesn't, then good riddance 
2016-06-04 18:41:51	@Espyo	we don't need somebody who causes so many problems on the wiki AND refuses to listen
2016-06-04 18:41:58	@Espyo	if somebody causes problems without knowing, that's perfectly fine
2016-06-04 18:42:07	@Espyo	but if they're warned, and keep doing stuff wrong, they're just a problem, not a helper
2016-06-04 18:42:08	Marty2000	Oh, off-topic (as always), but you know, in Pikmin 3, you have plot related logs when you finish days.... I'm trying to get all of them
2016-06-04 18:42:18	@Espyo	hm? we already have them all

2016-06-04 18:42:53	Marty2000	How to say
2016-06-04 18:43:03	Marty2000	When you choose a day to play
2016-06-04 18:43:11	Marty2000	Above the day's icon, you can have, for instance
2016-06-04 18:43:16	Marty2000	"To the Twilight River!"
2016-06-04 18:43:18	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-04 18:43:21	Marty2000	It's just a name for the day
2016-06-04 18:43:23	@Espyo	the game files calls them "chapter names"
2016-06-04 18:43:32	@Espyo	I can get a list
2016-06-04 18:43:36	@Espyo	it's easy to access

2016-06-04 18:47:42	@Espyo	well, I don't care
2016-06-04 18:47:47	@Espyo	we don't have time to spend with nonsense
2016-06-04 18:47:51	@Espyo	so if he does something wrong again
2016-06-04 18:47:55	@Espyo	can't say we didn't warn him
2016-06-04 18:48:02	@Espyo	I'll ban him for 3 months if he does something wrong
2016-06-04 18:48:09	@Espyo	this'll be fun
2016-06-04 18:48:53	Marty2000	My theory about dandelions and seeding dandelions has just broken down
2016-06-04 18:48:59	Marty2000	It was a big coincidence
2016-06-04 18:49:08	Marty2000	I have the two species at once right now
2016-06-04 18:49:08	@Espyo	oh, it was?
2016-06-04 18:49:17	@Espyo	that makes me a bit sad, actually
2016-06-04 18:49:25	@Espyo	it'd be a nice detail if you could only have one at a time
2016-06-04 18:49:35	@Espyo	but then, I don't know enough about botany to say if it makes sense or not
2016-06-04 18:49:44	@Espyo	it could make sense to have seeding and matured dandelions at the same time, in the same season
2016-06-04 18:49:48	Marty2000	You can have both at once
2016-06-04 18:49:54	Marty2000	(in real)
2016-06-04 18:50:05	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-04 18:50:07	@Espyo	I see
2016-06-04 18:50:36	Marty2000	I have a tiny kind of garden (not really a garden, but similar) in my house and I have plenty of dandelions when Spring comes
2016-06-04 18:50:46	Marty2000	And I can tell you that you can have both
2016-06-04 18:51:06	@Espyo	that's nice!
2016-06-04 18:51:35	Marty2000	They're my favorite plant, he he

2016-06-04 18:52:31	Marty2000	You can eat the leaves in salad too
2016-06-04 18:52:40	@Espyo	oh, wow
2016-06-04 18:52:45	@Espyo	doesn't Louie say the same?

2016-06-04 18:53:09	Marty2000	Yes, he does
2016-06-04 18:55:17	Marty2000	I already tasted it... that's cool. I add eggs and soybean, with olive oil/vinaigrette
2016-06-04 18:55:39	Marty2000	This year, though...
2016-06-04 18:55:45	Marty2000	Not many grew up :/
2016-06-04 18:55:49	Marty2000	Bad weather
2016-06-04 18:58:43	@Espyo	ugh, yeah, the weather is awful everywhere
2016-06-04 19:04:14	Yoshi2	Marty2000, Espyo: is either of you flooded yet?
2016-06-04 19:04:27	Yoshi2	seems a few places in germany have been flooded
2016-06-04 19:04:45	Marty2000	Lots of places have been flooded in France
2016-06-04 19:04:50	Marty2000	But I am not, fortunately
2016-06-04 19:05:00	Marty2000	well, I mean
2016-06-04 19:05:08	Marty2000	My place wasn't flooded
2016-06-04 19:05:17	Marty2000	I'm quite far from rivers and such
2016-06-04 19:06:11	Yoshi2	the closest river here is far enough that it will never, ever flood me
2016-06-04 19:07:13	Marty2000	Do you guys live in cities or in the countryside? I do live in the countryside
2016-06-04 19:07:38	Marty2000	Could be almost considered a city, though
2016-06-04 19:07:40	@Espyo	everything is perfectly fine here
2016-06-04 19:07:47	Marty2000	It's a big village, if you prefer :p
2016-06-04 19:07:52	@Espyo	I mean, we occasionally hear of this or that place got some floods, but that happens every year
2016-06-04 19:08:11	@Espyo	I live in a big city, and quite high from sea level
2016-06-04 19:08:17	@Espyo	and far from any river
2016-06-04 19:08:27	@Espyo	hm, actually, there is a river nearby, but it could never reach me
2016-06-04 19:08:32	@Espyo	plus I never seen it rise too much
2016-06-04 19:20:11	Yoshi2	Marty2000: I live in a city
2016-06-04 19:20:27	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 19:22:16	Yoshi2	Espyo, Marty2000: have you ever seen battalion wars gameplay?
2016-06-04 19:22:22	Marty2000	Some
2016-06-04 19:22:29	@Espyo	only from your videos
2016-06-04 19:22:47	Marty2000	Mainly from your videos too
2016-06-04 19:23:23	Yoshi2	I recently stumbled upon this video of the game from when it was still called advance wars: under fire: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Kz5lBW_8Q
2016-06-04 19:24:10	Yoshi2	see if that gameplay looks familiar
2016-06-04 19:24:49	@Espyo	oh, I can definitely see similarities
2016-06-04 19:24:55	Marty2000	Same
2016-06-04 19:24:57	@Espyo	but the game's style looks different
2016-06-04 19:25:42	Yoshi2	yup, the art style is much less cartoony
2016-06-04 19:25:58	@Espyo	a lot
2016-06-04 19:26:20	Marty2000	I prefer the current one
2016-06-04 19:26:23	Yoshi2	it's almost ironic, the AW series isn't known for being realistic and yet this game has such a realistic-ish style
2016-06-04 19:27:51	@Espyo	I guess they tried to take it into a new direction
2016-06-04 19:27:55	@Espyo	and regretted it at the last second
2016-06-04 19:28:13	Yoshi2	but somebody in the comments says this was a demo converted from a planned PS2 game called Versus
2016-06-04 19:28:48	Yoshi2	I found a string in the game files saying "Versus for GameCube" and that would make a LOT of sense
2016-06-04 19:31:51	Marty2000	Espyo: you know, in the Garden of Hope on day 2, you can build two bridges... one leads to a Red Bulborb, the other to the SS Drake
2016-06-04 19:32:03	Marty2000	Somehow, I managed to build the first part of the latter bridge
2016-06-04 19:32:16	Marty2000	Sadly, the remaining fragments are in a crystal...
2016-06-04 19:32:22	Marty2000	But the bridge is nearly finished
2016-06-04 19:32:30	Marty2000	If I could somehow get a little out of bounds
2016-06-04 19:32:37	Marty2000	I could try to break the game
2016-06-04 19:32:41	@Espyo	woah
2016-06-04 19:32:43	@Espyo	that's awesome
2016-06-04 19:32:54	@Espyo	I love finding out that a game was initially a different plan in development
2016-06-04 19:33:17	@Espyo	yeah, that'd be great
2016-06-04 19:33:51	Yoshi2	and there are actually a lot of reviews of this demo that can be found on the internet
2016-06-04 19:34:04	Yoshi2	too bad the demo itself likely can't be found
2016-06-04 19:35:18	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-04 19:35:55	Yoshi2	meh, the demo shows a few features that aren't in the game which is pretty damn cool
2016-06-04 19:36:00	Yoshi2	wonder if those can be enabled again
2016-06-04 19:36:15	@Espyo	a few them likely can
2016-06-04 19:36:17	@Espyo	you have to find them
2016-06-04 19:37:54	Yoshi2	I started off modding BW thinking "yeah, these graphics are the only thing that are unused that can still be found"
2016-06-04 19:38:17	Yoshi2	and now we are up to unused areas, unused strings, unused music/voice acting and possibly unused behaviour
2016-06-04 19:38:45	Yoshi2	wonder how much tcrf would appreciate uploading all the unused music and audio because there is quite a bit of that
2016-06-04 19:39:29	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-04 19:39:36	@Espyo	they'll live
2016-06-04 19:39:41	@Espyo	even if it's several hundred MB
2016-06-04 19:39:57	Yoshi2	there is some unused music that is broken up into bits
2016-06-04 19:40:09	Yoshi2	I will have to glue that together
2016-06-04 19:40:14	@Espyo	that's kinda sucky
2016-06-04 19:40:23	@Espyo	ok, I'm gonna go on windows now, and try out Cemu
2016-06-04 19:40:35	@Espyo	I'll be back in like half an hour
2016-06-04 19:40:43	Yoshi2	good luck

2016-06-04 21:48:24	@Espyo	SOMEBODY ENABLED UNUSED ENEMIES IN PIK3
2016-06-04 21:48:37	Marty2000	Wow
2016-06-04 21:48:39	Marty2000	I'll watch
2016-06-04 21:48:52	Marty2000	That person
2016-06-04 21:48:53	Marty2000	I know him
2016-06-04 21:49:06	Marty2000	https://www.twitch.tv/bielr3 I watch his speedruns here
2016-06-04 21:49:13	Marty2000	That looks great
2016-06-04 21:50:08	Marty2000	Wow...
2016-06-04 21:50:11	Marty2000	So great

2016-06-04 21:53:03	Marty2000	I guess he uses Loadiine
2016-06-04 21:53:09	UltraMario	hi
2016-06-04 21:53:15	Marty2000	Like the customs UltraMario uses for SSb
2016-06-04 21:53:16	Marty2000	Hi
2016-06-04 21:55:01	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-04 21:55:03	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REufQDiAu58&list=PLCCH_DC0LCZ0zQ53la7X9Lvi2LuL7_5NV&index=3
2016-06-04 21:55:09	@Espyo	also, on this one, at 2:20
2016-06-04 21:55:15	@Espyo	he uses a bomb-rock on a Bug-Eyed Crawmad
2016-06-04 21:55:17	@Espyo	it LOSES its eye
2016-06-04 21:55:26	@Espyo	can you use a bomb-rock on a Bug-Eyed Crawmad in the final game?
2016-06-04 21:55:31	@Espyo	like, is there any stage where you have both?
2016-06-04 21:56:02	Marty2000	No
2016-06-04 21:56:34	Marty2000	That's my chance
2016-06-04 21:56:42	Marty2000	I can ask him to have a Toady Bloyster and a Purple Pikmin together
2016-06-04 21:56:51	Marty2000	We could see if they get inked
2016-06-04 21:59:31	UltraMario	SPLATATATATATATATA
2016-06-04 21:59:32	UltraMario	:p
2016-06-04 21:59:50	Marty2000	That's just incredible it loses its eyes... heh
2016-06-04 22:03:42	Marty2000	Hey Espyo, with loadiine, you could probably use your hacked Pikmin 3 directly on your Wii U
2016-06-04 22:03:55	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-06-04 22:04:06	Marty2000	And it doesn't change your save since nothing will happen if you don't use Loadiine
2016-06-04 22:04:17	@Espyo	but I think I need a different firmware version
2016-06-04 22:04:25	Marty2000	a vanilla game as UltraMario says :p
2016-06-04 22:04:37	Marty2000	The latest works fine
2016-06-04 22:04:43	UltraMario	tru
2016-06-04 22:04:50	UltraMario	well
2016-06-04 22:04:59	UltraMario	it can impact your save data
2016-06-04 22:05:13	UltraMario	i got a high  score on classic mode thnx to hax
2016-06-04 22:05:14	UltraMario	heh
2016-06-04 22:05:21	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 22:05:25	Marty2000	But only scores
2016-06-04 22:05:33	UltraMario	yea
2016-06-04 22:05:37	UltraMario	stuff like that
2016-06-04 22:05:37	Marty2000	For example, it doesn't save custom musics in SSB, right?
2016-06-04 22:05:41	UltraMario	nope
2016-06-04 22:06:04	Marty2000	So the only thing Espyo would risk is having 999;999;999;999 blah blah blah score on blah blah map ;)
2016-06-04 22:06:07	UltraMario	heh
2016-06-04 22:08:12	@Espyo	I DID hack my Wii
2016-06-04 22:08:15	@Espyo	but I'm not sure about my Wii U...
2016-06-04 22:08:19	@Espyo	it's still kinda recent
2016-06-04 22:08:25	@Espyo	I could get in trouble where I wouldn't with the Wii
2016-06-04 22:08:34	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-04 22:08:43	UltraMario	well
2016-06-04 22:08:46	UltraMario	with wii u
2016-06-04 22:08:52	UltraMario	there's less risk of bricking stuff
2016-06-04 22:08:56	UltraMario	in my experience, anyway
2016-06-04 22:10:17	Marty2000	With Loadiine, I think your hack is only temporary UltraMario, right?
2016-06-04 22:10:32	UltraMario	yea
2016-06-04 22:10:35	UltraMario	well
2016-06-04 22:10:50	Marty2000	(but for scores)
2016-06-04 22:10:55	UltraMario	idk ive never tried stuff like a homebrew channel or anything
2016-06-04 22:11:06	UltraMario	ive only really done smash modding so *shrugs*
2016-06-04 22:11:19	Marty2000	Same for me
2016-06-04 22:11:33	UltraMario	also
2016-06-04 22:11:34	UltraMario	bad news
2016-06-04 22:11:39	Marty2000	If I could, I'd modify Pikmin 3, but unfortunately, I don't have the files
2016-06-04 22:11:40	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-06-04 22:11:43	UltraMario	i accidentally formatted my sd card recently
2016-06-04 22:11:44	UltraMario	;-;
2016-06-04 22:11:48	UltraMario	rip my music

2016-06-04 22:12:32	UltraMario	rude
2016-06-04 22:12:35	Marty2000	But you did upload them on Google?
2016-06-04 22:12:36	UltraMario	nah it's okay
2016-06-04 22:12:39	UltraMario	well
2016-06-04 22:12:42	Marty2000	Can't you get them back?
2016-06-04 22:12:43	UltraMario	ive uploaded some of them
2016-06-04 22:12:48	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-04 22:12:51	Marty2000	I see

2016-06-04 22:48:08	Yoshi2|offline	I will gladly take that over having to smell smoke ever again :I
2016-06-04 22:48:41	Marty2000	I'll show you what medicine to take tomorrow for such cancers

2016-06-05 00:26:25	Marty2000	Espyo, sorry to bother you, but where are you at with the Seed article? Do you think we could make it soon?
2016-06-05 00:28:20	@Espyo	haven't started it
2016-06-05 00:28:22	@Espyo	but I think we can write it
2016-06-05 00:28:38	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-05 00:29:32	Marty2000	We have to think of what we can put, first... I know what to add in the Gallery section, we can also add the glitch about maturity... we can explain how to have seeds (Onions+Candypop Buds)... hmm, what else...
2016-06-05 00:30:02	Marty2000	That's quite shot, for the moment, actually
2016-06-05 00:30:15	Marty2000	short*
2016-06-05 00:33:24	Marty2000	Ok, I have a glitch with the only Violet Candypop Bud of Mission Mode... it doesn't expel the good number of seeds :/
2016-06-05 00:33:41	@Espyo	speaking of maturity
2016-06-05 00:33:44	@Espyo	add to your todo:
2016-06-05 00:33:50	@Espyo	explain how maturation only works in-camera to the wiki
2016-06-05 00:34:05	Marty2000	It's already added
2016-06-05 00:34:09	Marty2000	He he
2016-06-05 00:34:11	@Espyo	hm? I don't remember you adding it...
2016-06-05 00:34:23	Marty2000	You told me to add it
2016-06-05 00:35:38	Marty2000	Ok, that's a (n) ... annoying glitch ... I throw four Pikmin in the Candypop Bud, I get only three
2016-06-05 00:35:48	Marty2000	It's probably the candypop bud of that color that is glitched
2016-06-05 00:38:51	Marty2000	Oh... that can be used to create more than 5 Purple Pikmin!
2016-06-05 00:38:55	Marty2000	Wow...
2016-06-05 00:39:00	@Espyo	wow...
2016-06-05 00:39:20	Marty2000	You'll see
2016-06-05 00:39:24	Marty2000	I got 7 Purple Pikmin
2016-06-05 00:39:37	Marty2000	I'll take a screenshot for you
2016-06-05 00:39:45	Marty2000	That can be both a good and bad glitch, hehe
2016-06-05 00:40:47	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/22/1465083642-purples.jpg
2016-06-05 00:41:35	Marty2000	If this glitch can be reproduced in Story Mode... that will be cool
2016-06-05 00:42:46	Marty2000	Seems hard enough to reproduce, though
2016-06-05 00:44:37	@Espyo	hm, what're the steps?
2016-06-05 00:44:55	Marty2000	Just throw Pikmin in it as fast as possible
2016-06-05 00:45:11	Marty2000	Without pointing at the Candypop Bud (the Pikmin are directly sucked in they are thrown over it)
2016-06-05 00:45:42	Marty2000	Ah, and don't use 5 Pikmin to make those Purple Pikmin
2016-06-05 00:45:49	Marty2000	Only 4 ;)
2016-06-05 00:46:21	Marty2000	4 at once, I mean
2016-06-05 00:48:44	Marty2000	I've got a video for it
2016-06-05 00:49:04	@Espyo	hm
2016-06-05 00:52:36	Marty2000	I can't reproduce it, ugh
2016-06-05 00:52:57	Marty2000	Fortunately, I recorded... that's so weird

2016-06-05 01:01:28	Marty2000	I just can't get it to happen again... shh :/
2016-06-05 01:02:45	Marty2000	Ah! I could!
2016-06-05 01:03:03	Marty2000	I think the Pikmin must fall into the water the moment you tuch it with a leader
2016-06-05 01:03:09	Marty2000	the flower* not the water
2016-06-05 01:04:18	Marty2000	touch*

2016-06-05 01:08:54	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-05 01:09:00	@Espyo	looked to me like you just get two Pikmin to go in at once
2016-06-05 01:09:26	Marty2000	Yeah but normally, you can only produce 5 Purple Pikmin with th flower
2016-06-05 01:09:40	Marty2000	There are seven, here
2016-06-05 01:11:08	Marty2000	Anyway, I've just reproduced the glitch again, and indeed, you need to throw two Pikmin at the same moment into the flower
2016-06-05 01:13:35	Marty2000	I've just noticed that it was actually what you said :p Sorry

2016-06-05 12:11:35	Yoshi2	what tasks
2016-06-05 12:11:55	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Treasure_Hoard Most treasures have their German names untranslated
2016-06-05 12:12:02	Marty2000	We could translate them...
2016-06-05 12:12:10	Marty2000	but we're not as fluent as you, I think ;)
2016-06-05 12:17:09	Marty2000	But anyway, don't feel obligated. I'll translate them later if you cannot ;)
2016-06-05 12:18:05	Marty2000	There are so many treasures that it is a very time-consuming task
2016-06-05 12:18:35	Yoshi2	I can't translate anything that isn't written on the page :>
2016-06-05 12:19:13	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-05 12:19:23	Marty2000	You have to click on a treasure's name :p
2016-06-05 12:19:26	Yoshi2	oh
2016-06-05 12:19:29	Yoshi2	too much effort
2016-06-05 12:19:34	Yoshi2	¯\(ツ)/¯  
2016-06-05 12:19:40	Marty2000	No problem 
2016-06-05 12:19:46	Marty2000	I'll translate them myself then
2016-06-05 12:20:14	Marty2000	And possibly ask you in the case I'm not sure
2016-06-05 12:20:15	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-05 12:24:42	Marty2000	I also have to translate Italian names, I forgot
2016-06-05 12:24:56	Marty2000	That will be no problem for those, though
2016-06-05 12:36:33	Yoshi2	ok this is interesting http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sunseed_Berry
2016-06-05 12:36:46	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-06-05 12:37:22	Marty2000	What in particular?
2016-06-05 12:37:23	Yoshi2	in German there is a thing called "Sonnenblumenkern", which is sunflower seed or so in English
2016-06-05 12:37:47	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-05 12:38:16	Marty2000	I think we can add it as a note
2016-06-05 12:38:19	Yoshi2	so Sonnenkern is kinda similar to Sunseed
2016-06-05 12:38:43	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-05 12:39:24	Marty2000	https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenblume#Sonnenblumenkerne Yeah
2016-06-05 12:39:30	Marty2000	Thanks for that, it should be added

2016-06-05 12:55:15	Marty2000	I also have ideas for P3 seeds... their appearance depends on the Pikmin type
2016-06-05 12:55:30	Marty2000	And everyhting could link to maturity too (sprouts+glitch in P1)
2016-06-05 12:58:57	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-05 12:59:06	@Espyo	what do you mean depends on the type?
2016-06-05 12:59:32	Marty2000	Seems like a rock for the Rock Pikmin, with stripes and little for Winged Pikmin, little for the White Pikmin, and big for the Purple Pikmin
2016-06-05 12:59:52	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-06-05 13:00:55	Marty2000	I already have ideas for the ==Gallery== section
2016-06-05 13:01:17	Marty2000	Screenshot of seed for each type, seeds ejected by Onion/Candypop Buds, sprouts

2016-06-05 13:04:02	Marty2000	Mystery of the day: if you dismiss a Winged Pikmin near a grape (Dawn Pustules), it will turn around it a little by flying (before taking a piece of the fruit)
2016-06-05 13:04:05	Marty2000	But if you throw it
2016-06-05 13:04:08	Marty2000	It will walk
2016-06-05 13:05:30	@Espyo	I guess it never touches the ground if you  dismiss
2016-06-05 13:05:34	@Espyo	but does if you throw
2016-06-05 13:05:34	@Espyo	so
2016-06-05 13:05:51	Marty2000	Yeah, but if runs in the air if you throw even on the fruit
2016-06-05 13:05:54	Marty2000	it runs*

2016-06-05 13:23:33	@Espyo	woah :|
2016-06-05 13:25:05	Marty2000	Using the crushing glitch
2016-06-05 13:25:13	Marty2000	Well, the one that allows invincible Pikmin
2016-06-05 13:25:38	Marty2000	I wonder what you could do with those "leaders"
2016-06-05 13:25:45	Marty2000	They die whenever you throw them, though
2016-06-05 13:31:34	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-06-05 13:31:41	@Espyo	what if you thrown one into an abyss?
2016-06-05 13:31:59	Marty2000	Hmm... I should try
2016-06-05 13:32:02	Marty2000	I'll tell you
2016-06-05 13:32:05	Marty2000	I'm going to try ;)
2016-06-05 13:32:18	@Espyo	cool
2016-06-05 13:37:29	Yoshi2	I found a new thing in BW, which is that you can manually jump into vehicles (something that was possible in that pre-release video I showed you)
2016-06-05 13:37:35	Marty2000	They simply respawn and die
2016-06-05 13:37:38	@Espyo	ooh
2016-06-05 13:37:45	Marty2000	COol!
2016-06-05 13:37:47	Marty2000	Cool!*
2016-06-05 13:37:51	@Espyo	so in the final game you just jump if you get near one?
2016-06-05 13:37:54	@Espyo	what if you don't want to?
2016-06-05 13:38:06	Yoshi2	in the final game all units are already in the vehicles
2016-06-05 13:38:14	Yoshi2	or the units are scripted to enter a vehicle
2016-06-05 13:38:34	Yoshi2	you don't manually enter vehicles
2016-06-05 13:40:11	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-05 13:40:30	Yoshi2	after a few tests, seems that this manual entering is slightly weird
2016-06-05 13:40:40	Yoshi2	when you enter the vehicle, your unit is always the driver
2016-06-05 13:40:55	Yoshi2	all other units are pushed to other places on the vehicle
2016-06-05 13:43:07	Yoshi2	this feature allows for some hilarious stuff though, I should make a video about it again
2016-06-05 13:44:17	@Espyo	you definitely should
2016-06-05 13:47:32	Yoshi2	on my way straight to 1k subs, hiyyyyaaaaaa

2016-06-05 13:59:28	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-06-05 13:59:37	@Espyo	so, not a lot of people know about this eye-removal mechanic
2016-06-05 13:59:39	@Espyo	needs to be added
2016-06-05 13:59:52	Marty2000	The eye is only temporarily removed
2016-06-05 14:00:00	@Espyo	but we need more i--
2016-06-05 14:00:01	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-05 14:00:03	Marty2000	If it goes into its den, its eye will reappear
2016-06-05 14:00:05	@Espyo	yeah, I was gonna ask about that
2016-06-05 14:00:23	Yoshi2	Marty2000: with http://www.pikminwiki.com/Infernal_Vegetable it's interesting that most of the languages use "Infernal" (from italian) in some form, while the German word uses "Höllisch", which is from "Hölle" which means "Hell"
2016-06-05 14:00:43	Marty2000	lol

2016-06-05 14:00:47	@Espyo	we can still find more info

2016-06-05 14:00:58	Marty2000	I can try
2016-06-05 14:01:00	Marty2000	Let me see
2016-06-05 14:01:13	Marty2000	I'll add the piece of info for the Infernal Vegetable too
2016-06-05 14:02:43	Marty2000	By the way, if it swallows a bomb rock
2016-06-05 14:03:15	Marty2000	It instantly turns over

2016-06-05 14:05:35	Marty2000	And it loses 1/3 of its health if it swallows it
2016-06-05 14:05:36	Yoshi2	oooh finally found a treasure without a translation

2016-06-05 14:08:16	Yoshi2	or Leaf-o-Copter?
2016-06-05 14:08:18	Marty2000	Cool one
2016-06-05 14:08:23	Yoshi2	which one would be better?
2016-06-05 14:08:34	Yoshi2	leaf-o-copter sounds a bit odd
2016-06-05 14:08:35	Marty2000	I'd say Leaf Copter, but I'm not sure
2016-06-05 14:08:50	Yoshi2	it's not a formal word anyway, I think
2016-06-05 14:09:32	Yoshi2	Espyo: what would you say?
2016-06-05 14:09:51	Yoshi2	or Leaf Helicopter
2016-06-05 14:10:22	Marty2000	Leaf Copter is perfectly understandable and better I think
2016-06-05 14:10:31	Marty2000	Well, that's what I think
2016-06-05 14:10:36	Marty2000	It sound funnier ^^^
2016-06-05 14:10:38	Yoshi2	Marty2000: Leaf Copter or Leaf Helicopter? :>
2016-06-05 14:10:48	Marty2000	Leaf Copter :D
2016-06-05 14:10:59	Marty2000	Little copter flying around with leaves... wow
2016-06-05 14:11:15	Marty2000	(Ok, I'll stop)
2016-06-05 14:11:21	Yoshi2	copter is colloquial for helicopter
2016-06-05 14:11:28	Marty2000	I know
2016-06-05 14:11:40	Marty2000	To me, it sounds funny
2016-06-05 14:11:49	Marty2000	I don't know if it's the case in German
2016-06-05 14:12:15	Yoshi2	it's likely supposed to be funny-sounding in German too
2016-06-05 14:12:45	Marty2000	Hmm, what's the French name for that, I don't remember...

2016-06-05 14:14:14	Marty2000	Their French is way funnier
2016-06-05 14:14:17	Marty2000	I'll check

2016-06-05 14:15:00	Yoshi2	how do I edit the meaning of a word

2016-06-05 14:15:37	Marty2000	?
2016-06-05 14:15:50	Yoshi2	oh, I need to add GerM=
2016-06-05 14:16:06	Marty2000	|Ger=The German's name
2016-06-05 14:16:11	Marty2000	|GerM=your translation

2016-06-05 14:21:49	Yoshi2	I can't really find a translation for arboresk, but firlefanz basically means unnecessary stuff
2016-06-05 14:21:59	Marty2000	Oh, I see
2016-06-05 14:22:12	Marty2000	Firlefanz translates to frivolity then
2016-06-05 14:22:29	Marty2000	That's probably the same as the French (NOA) name
2016-06-05 14:22:52	Marty2000	While the French (NOE) is common... the (NOA) version is funny too
2016-06-05 14:22:57	Marty2000	Arboresker may be Arboreal...
2016-06-05 14:23:37	Yoshi2	 frivolity doesn't really seem to mean what firlefanz means

2016-06-05 14:27:49	Marty2000	I wish we had funny names in French... but I guess it's still better than having no translation, so I shouldn't compalin

2016-06-05 14:28:12	Marty2000	Still... When I tried Pikmin 3 in French, I was a bit disappointed
2016-06-05 14:28:17	Marty2000	It's so different from P1 and P2
2016-06-05 14:28:38	Marty2000	In P3, the dialogs use a lot of kiddish words
2016-06-05 14:29:02	@Espyo	aw, that sucks
2016-06-05 14:29:03	Marty2000	It's not bothersome, but that sounds strange, if you see what I mean

2016-06-05 14:31:34	Marty2000	Britanny sounds like a 6-year-old kid, her notes on the watermelon fruit... "Alph loves sucking up the juice like a disgusting fatman"
2016-06-05 14:31:58	Marty2000	I'll have to check the notes on the other fruits... that's odd
2016-06-05 14:32:22	Marty2000	"and spit the seeds"
2016-06-05 14:33:49	Yoshi2	Marty2000: I'm still not entirely sure about translating firlefanz as frivolity
2016-06-05 14:34:15	Marty2000	"Trumpery" then?
2016-06-05 14:34:28	Marty2000	That's what I got from a translator
2016-06-05 14:34:49	Marty2000	You have "frippery"... 
2016-06-05 14:35:13	Marty2000	Folderol

2016-06-05 14:36:10	@Espyo	eesh
2016-06-05 14:36:20	Yoshi2	I hate all those words
2016-06-05 14:36:32	Yoshi2	they make it more complicated than it is
2016-06-05 14:37:39	Marty2000	I'd still choose "frivolity"... :p Espyo, what word would you choose, according to Yoshi2's definition of Firlefanz
2016-06-05 14:37:50	@Espyo	I haven't been following this conversation
2016-06-05 14:37:52	@Espyo	I'm so confused
2016-06-05 14:38:12	Marty2000	<Yoshi2>: I can't really find a translation for arboresk, but firlefanz basically means unnecessary stuff
2016-06-05 14:38:27	Marty2000	Arboresk=Arboreal 
2016-06-05 14:38:30	Marty2000	I think
2016-06-05 14:38:44	Yoshi2	https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firlefanz "Das Wort bedeutet heute umgangssprachlich abwertend so viel wie Tand, wertloser (modischer) Kram, aber auch Albernheit, Torheit, Kinderei. Firlefanz steht auch als Synonym für bedeutungslose, unerhebliche Information und überflüssige Ausschmückung."
2016-06-05 14:39:06	Yoshi2	"überflüssige Ausschmückung"
2016-06-05 14:39:14	Marty2000	Seems it cannot be exactly translated
2016-06-05 14:39:28	@Espyo	that's just confusing me further :|
2016-06-05 14:39:30	Marty2000	That happens to lots of words from different languages
2016-06-05 14:39:34	Marty2000	Or vice-versa
2016-06-05 14:39:53	Yoshi2	redundant decoration
2016-06-05 14:40:04	Marty2000	That fits
2016-06-05 14:40:14	Marty2000	Arboreal redundant decoration seems fine
2016-06-05 14:41:08	Marty2000	What do you think about "Arboreal redundant decoration", Yoshi2 and Espyo?
2016-06-05 14:41:41	@Espyo	"redundant decoration", huh? try "frivolity"
2016-06-05 14:41:50	Yoshi2	:|
2016-06-05 14:42:02	Marty2000	I told Yoshi2 to put frivolity
2016-06-05 14:42:12	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-05 14:42:12	Marty2000	But for him, it doesn't exactly mean the same
2016-06-05 14:42:20	@Espyo	yeah, I can see that it's not quite the same
2016-06-05 14:42:22	Marty2000	So we shouldn't put it then
2016-06-05 14:42:28	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-05 14:42:32	Yoshi2	frivolity seems to have an element of sillyness in it
2016-06-05 14:42:34	Marty2000	Well, i think
2016-06-05 14:42:37	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-05 14:42:39	@Espyo	well, I think "redundant decoration" is too long
2016-06-05 14:42:44	@Espyo	decoration probably works fine enough
2016-06-05 14:43:05	Yoshi2	but it's not just decoration, it is unnecessary decoration
2016-06-05 14:43:23	@Espyo	well
2016-06-05 14:43:25	Yoshi2	probably a joke on how trees just drop their leaves
2016-06-05 14:43:26	@Espyo	it's a frippery then :|
2016-06-05 14:43:39	Marty2000	Frivolity is something unnecessary
2016-06-05 14:43:56	@Espyo	>Inappropriately silly: a frivolous purchase.
2016-06-05 14:44:01	@Espyo	I get that frivolous might not work
2016-06-05 14:44:04	@Espyo	but frippery works fine, imo
2016-06-05 14:44:06	Yoshi2	fippery is more fitting
2016-06-05 14:44:14	Marty2000	Then, frippery
2016-06-05 14:44:58	Yoshi2	maybe "unnecessary decoration" as a note?
2016-06-05 14:45:14	Marty2000	"trivial"?
2016-06-05 14:45:35	@Espyo	I'd probably would just go with Frippery
2016-06-05 14:45:46	@Espyo	I think the European translations were built on top of the English ones
2016-06-05 14:45:58	@Espyo	so since there's no word for Frippery in German, no wonder they had to explain the meaning in detail
2016-06-05 14:46:03	@Espyo	but in the end, all they wanted to say was "Frippery"
2016-06-05 14:47:48	Marty2000	Yoshi2: do you still like doughnuts since last time?
2016-06-05 14:48:48	Yoshi2	I will eat them if I have some, but I won't go out to buy lots of them for myself
2016-06-05 14:48:50	Marty2000	This will probably be your favorite series http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sweet_Tooth_Series (and Klemen702's least favorite :p )

2016-06-05 14:50:30	Yoshi2	due to -chen at the end, Türmchen means "small tower"
2016-06-05 14:50:32	Yoshi2	soo
2016-06-05 14:50:37	Yoshi2	Small Conifer Tower?
2016-06-05 14:50:42	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 14:50:42	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-05 14:50:45	Marty2000	Sounds funny
2016-06-05 14:50:50	Marty2000	(again)
2016-06-05 14:51:39	Yoshi2	but I'm not sure about the capitalisation
2016-06-05 14:51:59	Marty2000	If it's capitalized in German, you do in English
2016-06-05 14:52:00	Yoshi2	small confier tower, Small confier tower, small Conifer tower, small Conifer Tower, Small Conifer Tower?
2016-06-05 14:52:09	Marty2000	Small Conifer Tower
2016-06-05 14:52:48	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Arboreal_Frippery Look
2016-06-05 14:53:02	Marty2000	In French (nOE) I put capital letters on both words
2016-06-05 14:53:23	Marty2000	FOr French (NOA), only one word is capitalized, so same in the translation
2016-06-05 14:54:06	Yoshi2	you are doing hardmode apparently
2016-06-05 14:54:16	Yoshi2	capitalizing two letters at the start :D
2016-06-05 14:54:30	Yoshi2	("FOr")

2016-06-05 15:01:32	@Espyo	and it wasn't the Japanese version
2016-06-05 15:01:41	@Espyo	wait, I wrote it down
2016-06-05 15:01:49	@Espyo	yeah, the US version has squeaky stupid noises
2016-06-05 15:01:53	@Espyo	EU fixed it
2016-06-05 15:01:54	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 15:01:59	Marty2000	It's not in Eu though

2016-06-05 15:02:05	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 15:02:23	@Espyo	fixed
2016-06-05 15:02:37	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-05 15:02:58	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Rock_Pikmin&curid=7833&diff=166165&oldid=165900 I wonder if this user tested the autonomous lunges
2016-06-05 15:03:01	@Espyo	if they did... uh-oh
2016-06-05 15:03:08	@Espyo	means every enemy handles the lunge differently
2016-06-05 15:03:20	@Espyo	and we're lied to when the game files say it's a fixed 20
2016-06-05 15:03:40	Marty2000	Well, I reverted his edit telling him to check the "Technical" sections
2016-06-05 15:03:51	Marty2000	But if he were right... I'd feel bad then :/
2016-06-05 15:03:51	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-05 15:03:58	@Espyo	oh, it doesn't seem to be the case
2016-06-05 15:04:03	@Espyo	 1800 / 40 = 45
2016-06-05 15:04:13	@Espyo	(Bulbear HP / number of Rock Pikmin throws to kill)
2016-06-05 15:04:25	@Espyo	so the value he got reflects the throws, not lunges
2016-06-05 15:04:31	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 15:04:31	@Espyo	...unless the lunges work the same, and we just didn't notice
2016-06-05 15:04:38	@Espyo	lunges HAVE to cause less damage, right?
2016-06-05 15:04:39	Marty2000	Would you like me to test the lunge on something?
2016-06-05 15:04:48	@Espyo	I'd prefer it
2016-06-05 15:04:55	@Espyo	no need to check on a Spotty Bulbear, I don't think
2016-06-05 15:04:56	Marty2000	I'm playing P3, so I can test anything right now
2016-06-05 15:04:57	@Espyo	it'll take forever
2016-06-05 15:05:00	@Espyo	and get many of them killed
2016-06-05 15:05:01	@Espyo	great!
2016-06-05 15:05:04	@Espyo	well, try on a Wollywog
2016-06-05 15:05:04	Marty2000	Please tell me what I have to check
2016-06-05 15:05:09	@Espyo	should be easy
2016-06-05 15:05:12	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 15:05:17	Yoshi2	"Scheußliche Essware" so many ways to translate it
2016-06-05 15:05:36	Yoshi2	but it basically comes down to hideous victual
2016-06-05 15:05:39	Yoshi2	:|
2016-06-05 15:06:10	Marty2000	So I leave the Rock Pikmin attack the Wollywog alone, Espyo? And then, on another one, I throw the Rock Pikmin on it?
2016-06-05 15:06:26	Marty2000	Yoshi2: so that's the same as the English name

2016-06-05 15:07:14	Marty2000	I see :p)
2016-06-05 15:07:31	Marty2000	I should find 15 hits, normally
2016-06-05 15:07:33	Marty2000	Let's try
2016-06-05 15:08:18	@Espyo	yeah, that's it
2016-06-05 15:08:45	Marty2000	Yeah, that's 15
2016-06-05 15:08:51	@Espyo	ok, good
2016-06-05 15:08:55	@Espyo	the world still makes sense
2016-06-05 15:08:56	@Espyo	now for lunges
2016-06-05 15:08:58	@Espyo	it should take...
2016-06-05 15:09:10	@Espyo	 45 lunges
2016-06-05 15:09:14	@Espyo	eh, that'll take a while
2016-06-05 15:09:30	Marty2000	No problem

2016-06-05 15:11:38	Marty2000	45, Espyo
2016-06-05 15:11:43	Marty2000	So that's it
2016-06-05 15:11:54	@Espyo	phew
2016-06-05 15:12:00	@Espyo	ok, it all adds up!
2016-06-05 15:12:01	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-05 15:12:11	Marty2000	Bonus: I'll try with the lock-on
2016-06-05 15:12:18	@Espyo	hmm?
2016-06-05 15:12:22	@Espyo	why would the lock-on change anything?
2016-06-05 15:12:34	Marty2000	Because it does for crystal gates
2016-06-05 15:13:22	@Espyo	you mean the charge! mechanic?
2016-06-05 15:13:35	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 15:13:44	@Espyo	hm, that's a bit weird
2016-06-05 15:13:56	@Espyo	I know crystal gates can be destroyed sooner if you target the same quadrant every time
2016-06-05 15:13:59	@Espyo	but this is news to me
2016-06-05 15:14:02	@Espyo	got more details?
2016-06-05 15:14:58	Marty2000	Wait, it seems to change something
2016-06-05 15:15:16	Marty2000	Hmm, it's different from leaving Rock Pikmin charging alone or being thrown

2016-06-05 15:18:17	Yoshi2	well, that's enough for now
2016-06-05 15:18:22	Yoshi2	let's see how much progress I made
2016-06-05 15:18:37	Marty2000	A lot
2016-06-05 15:18:37	Yoshi2	25 out of 200 :'D
2016-06-05 15:18:42	Marty2000	Thanks :)
2016-06-05 15:19:21	Marty2000	Espyo
2016-06-05 15:19:28	Marty2000	If the Wollywog doesn't move
2016-06-05 15:19:28	Yoshi2	a number of the words are pretty boring and seem to be most close to the English translation
2016-06-05 15:19:45	Marty2000	And you attack it using the charge, let the Pikmin attack, whistle it and charge again
2016-06-05 15:19:52	Marty2000	It should 90 hits from the Rock Pikmin... :/
2016-06-05 15:19:59	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 15:20:10	Marty2000	take 90*
2016-06-05 15:20:43	@Espyo	uhm
2016-06-05 15:20:50	@Espyo	so a charge causes half damage?
2016-06-05 15:20:57	Marty2000	Seems like it
2016-06-05 15:21:03	Marty2000	Let's try everything with a Pellet Posy
2016-06-05 15:21:05	Marty2000	Simply, faster
2016-06-05 15:21:07	@Espyo	what about dismissing next to the enemy?
2016-06-05 15:21:12	@Espyo	yeah, might as well
2016-06-05 15:21:22	Marty2000	Dismissing causes the Rock Pikmin to attack alone, so 20
2016-06-05 15:21:27	@Espyo	right
2016-06-05 15:21:34	Marty2000	Ok, Pellet Posy
2016-06-05 15:21:37	Marty2000	Throw = 1
2016-06-05 15:21:54	Marty2000	Pikmin left alone = 4
2016-06-05 15:22:24	Marty2000	Charge, whistle, charge... = 8
2016-06-05 15:22:26	Marty2000	...
2016-06-05 15:22:32	Marty2000	(hits)
2016-06-05 15:22:47	Marty2000	So the charge mechanic divides the power of a Rock Pikmin by 10
2016-06-05 15:22:49	Marty2000	2*
2016-06-05 15:23:11	@Espyo	what if you charge, and then don't whistle them?
2016-06-05 15:23:13	Marty2000	It only deals 10 points damages when charging
2016-06-05 15:23:24	Marty2000	If will be left alone, so 20
2016-06-05 15:23:28	Marty2000	20 damages*
2016-06-05 15:23:35	@Espyo	they get up, and go at it again, but when they do attack again, does it count as a weak "charge" attack, or a normal "lunge" attack?
2016-06-05 15:23:58	Marty2000	I think it's a normal lunge once they get up
2016-06-05 15:24:00	Marty2000	I'll verify
2016-06-05 15:24:06	@Espyo	please do
2016-06-05 15:24:33	Marty2000	It's a normal lunge once they get up...
2016-06-05 15:24:59	Marty2000	It seems to have the same effect as an Ultra-spicy spray
2016-06-05 15:26:18	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-05 15:26:24	@Espyo	well, I'll update the infobox then
2016-06-05 15:27:20	Marty2000	You really need to be quite close to the enemy, though
2016-06-05 15:27:28	Marty2000	I mean, if the Rock Pikmin misses its charge attack
2016-06-05 15:27:39	Marty2000	The next attack will deal 20 damages, though
2016-06-05 15:27:42	@Espyo	right
2016-06-05 15:28:11	Marty2000	I guess it won't impact the other Pikmin insce they have to latch on
2016-06-05 15:28:27	Marty2000	Be right back
2016-06-05 15:28:31	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Rock_Pikmin how does this sound?
2016-06-05 15:28:34	@Espyo	(the infobox)
2016-06-05 15:30:39	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Koppai by Scruffy (-275 Fixed some grammar, to make the article more concise.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=8186&diff=166383
2016-06-05 15:31:30	Marty2000	Great
2016-06-05 15:32:12	Marty2000	By the way, sorry again to bother... but we should add the digging speed. I could do it, but it seems complicated to edit the infobox
2016-06-05 15:32:23	Marty2000	I mean, the general page with the skeleton and all
2016-06-05 15:32:29	@Espyo	no worries, it's on my todo
2016-06-05 15:32:30	@Espyo	I won't forget
2016-06-05 15:32:36	Marty2000	Okay, thanks
2016-06-05 15:32:40	@Espyo	yeah, infobox editing is NOT pretty...
2016-06-05 15:32:42	Marty2000	So you have a todo too... heh
2016-06-05 15:32:45	@Espyo	one of MediaWiki's biggest problems, in my opinion
2016-06-05 15:32:49	@Espyo	yeah, my todo is massive
2016-06-05 15:32:53	 *	@Espyo is checking...
2016-06-05 15:33:13	@Espyo	 387 lines
2016-06-05 15:33:23	Marty2000	Only?
2016-06-05 15:33:27	Marty2000	I'm joking
2016-06-05 15:33:31	Marty2000	Lol, that's a lot
2016-06-05 15:33:31	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-05 15:33:35	@Espyo	you scared me for a second :V
2016-06-05 15:33:44	@Espyo	a few of these might be old already
2016-06-05 15:33:51	@Espyo	and some aren't so much tasks as they are just steps inside a task
2016-06-05 15:34:00	Marty2000	Because you're not used to seeing me joke, unlike Yoshi2 and UltraMario
2016-06-05 15:34:03	Marty2000	Hmm, let's see mine
2016-06-05 15:34:15	@Espyo	I get that you joked, but
2016-06-05 15:34:16	Yoshi2	I know somebody who had a 50 lines todo for a program of his
2016-06-05 15:34:18	@Espyo	you could've also been serious
2016-06-05 15:34:25	Yoshi2	needless to say, a lot of that stuff never got done
2016-06-05 15:34:26	@Espyo	because I know that you know a lot of Pikmin's shenanigans
2016-06-05 15:34:31	@Espyo	you could easily have a list with like 500 items, knowing you
2016-06-05 15:34:38	Yoshi2	yes
2016-06-05 15:34:45	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-05 15:34:46	Yoshi2	maybe you are secretly that HSS guy
2016-06-05 15:34:50	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-05 15:34:53	Marty2000	Oh
2016-06-05 15:35:00	@Espyo	hm, with all the enemies that can be tricked by hiding...
2016-06-05 15:35:00	Marty2000	Uh... good weather, today?
2016-06-05 15:35:06	@Espyo	I'm starting to think ALL enemies can be tricked
2016-06-05 15:35:13	Marty2000	Same
2016-06-05 15:35:27	@Espyo	the Pikmin are just coded to act like they don't exist nearby if they're inside a plant
2016-06-05 15:35:34	@Espyo	so any enemy that works with proximity will just... be stutpid
2016-06-05 15:35:36	@Espyo	*stupid
2016-06-05 15:35:52	Marty2000	Even if they're in the plant themselves, they won't notice the Pikmin :p
2016-06-05 15:36:07	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-06-05 15:36:11	Marty2000	Reminder: 21 lines
2016-06-05 15:36:16	@Espyo	hm, speaking of, that should be added
2016-06-05 15:36:22	@Espyo	that they're so dumb, even being in the plant won't make them realize
2016-06-05 15:36:36	Marty2000	Unless they push the leader out of the hiding spot
2016-06-05 15:36:42	Marty2000	They will noticed him or her
2016-06-05 15:36:49	Marty2000	if so*
2016-06-05 15:37:42	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-06-05 15:38:04	Marty2000	Who added the Orange Bulborb in a "Non-deceivable" category?
2016-06-05 15:38:14	@Espyo	dunno
2016-06-05 15:38:19	Marty2000	Maybe they were using a previous version of the game
2016-06-05 15:38:44	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Hiding&oldid=146686 this is the first edit that had that, by me
2016-06-05 15:38:52	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-05 15:39:04	@Espyo	maybe different ones can or cannot be tricked?
2016-06-05 15:39:06	@Espyo	...*gulp*
2016-06-05 15:39:08	@Espyo	please no
2016-06-05 15:39:15	Marty2000	I'll verify :p
2016-06-05 15:39:22	Marty2000	Mission Mode
2016-06-05 15:39:23	@Espyo	let me check the game's files, first
2016-06-05 15:39:26	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 15:40:38	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Swooping_Snitchbug#Stats
2016-06-05 15:40:43	Marty2000	On the Garden of Hope Remix, its HP is 500.
2016-06-05 15:40:49	Marty2000	I put a note
2016-06-05 15:40:59	Marty2000	If you can, please verify in the game's files
2016-06-05 15:41:10	@Espyo	can't, it's DLC
2016-06-05 15:41:13	Marty2000	I can't be sure, I tested with a cute little Winged Pikmin :/
2016-06-05 15:41:16	Marty2000	Ah :/
2016-06-05 15:41:18	@Espyo	>mPropabilityEndWait
2016-06-05 15:41:19	Testyo	hmm, maybe I could to keep it then
2016-06-05 15:41:19	Marty2000	Well, no problem
2016-06-05 15:41:19	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-06-05 15:41:21	@Espyo	"Propability"
2016-06-05 15:41:28	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-05 15:41:45	@Espyo	other than that, I can't find anything related to hiding, invisibility, plants, etc.
2016-06-05 15:41:54	@Espyo	maybe I just saw it wrong
2016-06-05 15:41:59	@Espyo	if it even was me
2016-06-05 15:42:05	@Espyo	I could've just added it in because somebody else said it
2016-06-05 15:42:07	Marty2000	We should also add photos of all hiding plants
2016-06-05 15:42:09	Marty2000	I'll do
2016-06-05 15:42:27	 *	Marty2000 notes something in his reminder.
2016-06-05 15:42:38	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-05 15:43:02	Marty2000	Now, let's see something else
2016-06-05 15:43:11	Marty2000	What if the Rock Pikmin uses the charge mechanic...
2016-06-05 15:43:17	Marty2000	while sprayed? :p
2016-06-05 15:43:20	@Espyo	D:
2016-06-05 15:43:23	@Espyo	 5 damage?
2016-06-05 15:43:24	@Espyo	can't wait
2016-06-05 15:43:53	Marty2000	I am so sad
2016-06-05 15:43:59	Marty2000	Why couldn't it decrease in damages?
2016-06-05 15:44:03	Marty2000	It's 8 hits
2016-06-05 15:44:10	Marty2000	The Spicy spray doesn't change anything
2016-06-05 15:44:17	Marty2000	Makes sense, after all
2016-06-05 15:44:32	Marty2000	It already decreases the Pikmin power
2016-06-05 15:44:35	Marty2000	Pikmin's power
2016-06-05 15:46:46	Marty2000	[[Gate]]
2016-06-05 15:46:46	Testyo	"Gate" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Gate
2016-06-05 15:47:02	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Gate#Trivia
2016-06-05 15:47:07	Marty2000	In Pikmin 3, Pikmin that are thrown and touch a destroyed gate will perform a celebratory flip and cheer. It is unknown whether this is an oversight or on purpose.
2016-06-05 15:47:25	Marty2000	And even the working variation of the music plays during their celebratory flip
2016-06-05 15:47:42	Marty2000	So if you throw a lot of Pikmin, you will continuously hear the working variation of the music
2016-06-05 15:47:56	@Espyo	right
2016-06-05 15:48:09	@Espyo	heh, neat
2016-06-05 15:48:33	@Espyo	I don't think "a concept art" is correct English
2016-06-05 15:48:38	@Espyo	it's like saying "a rice" or "a money"
2016-06-05 15:48:51	@Espyo	it should be "a piece of concept art" or "a concept art image" or something
2016-06-05 15:49:54	Marty2000	Oh, I see, yeah
2016-06-05 15:56:35	Marty2000	I was about to forget for the Orange Bulborb... I'll try different levels
2016-06-05 15:56:55	Marty2000	I know that there's no hiding spot in Story Mode close enough to one
2016-06-05 15:57:20	@Espyo	right
2016-06-05 15:57:25	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Red_Pikmin&curid=1188&diff=166338&oldid=166127 ........yeah, I'm not buying it
2016-06-05 15:58:41	Marty2000	Tropical Forest Remix: deceivable
2016-06-05 16:00:01	@Espyo	that's just like an assassin passing their fingers through their weapon's blade
2016-06-05 16:00:07	@Espyo	it doesn't have to have any chemical
2016-06-05 16:00:44	Marty2000	Tropical Forest (BE!, 2 Orange. B): deceivable 
2016-06-05 16:01:59	Marty2000	Tropical Wilds Remix: deceivable
2016-06-05 16:02:37	@Espyo	yeah, I think I've heard enough
2016-06-05 16:02:43	@Espyo	I'm ready to say that all enemies can be deceived
2016-06-05 16:02:50	Marty2000	Garden of Hope Remix: no hiding spot close enough
2016-06-05 16:02:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 16:02:55	@Espyo	it'd make sense if strong enemies and bosses couldn't be outsmarted
2016-06-05 16:02:59	@Espyo	but even THEY can be outsmarted
2016-06-05 16:03:12	Marty2000	But the Swarming Sheargrubs...?
2016-06-05 16:03:18	Marty2000	The latter can hide
2016-06-05 16:03:26	Marty2000	I added that piece of info
2016-06-05 16:03:31	Marty2000	information
2016-06-05 16:03:31	@Espyo	well, the Swarming Sheargrubs aren't really predatory
2016-06-05 16:03:35	@Espyo	yeah, I noticed
2016-06-05 16:03:37	Marty2000	Yeah, true
2016-06-05 16:03:52	@Espyo	all enemies consider the Pikmin to not exist, if they're under a hiding plant
2016-06-05 16:03:54	@Espyo	that seems to be it
2016-06-05 16:04:14	@Espyo	so many of them can be tricked, none of them so far can't
2016-06-05 16:04:19	@Espyo	and you tried pretty much every enemy out there
2016-06-05 16:04:39	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 16:04:58	@Espyo	I doubt that they'd make it so the mighty Burrowing Snagret can be tricked, but something simple like... a Skeeterskate can't
2016-06-05 16:05:06	@Espyo	it's clear that it's a global mechanic for all enemies
2016-06-05 16:05:08	Marty2000	Maybe it's not the case with large bosses, though, but we cannot try... I guess they could be deceived to, though
2016-06-05 16:05:17	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-05 16:05:20	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-05 16:05:30	@Espyo	well, when we can hack the game, we can come back to this
2016-06-05 16:05:38	@Espyo	but for now, it's safe to tell the readers that all enemies can be tricked
2016-06-05 16:06:34	@Espyo	well, I'll edit the article, then
2016-06-05 16:06:47	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 16:09:07	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Hiding well, it sure is shorter now
2016-06-05 16:09:20	@Espyo	but it's still good
2016-06-05 16:09:28	Marty2000	Makes me want to add the images now
2016-06-05 16:09:31	Marty2000	which I'll doo
2016-06-05 16:09:33	Marty2000	do*
2016-06-05 16:09:34	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 16:09:35	@Espyo	cool
2016-06-05 16:10:09	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Clovers.jpg That one is already on Pikipedia and good
2016-06-05 16:10:11	Marty2000	I think
2016-06-05 16:10:57	Marty2000	I suppose we could also make a list of the /*a58888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888re88888aze where you can find hiding spots
2016-06-05 16:11:03	Marty2000	CAT!
2016-06-05 16:11:08	Marty2000	I'll restart
2016-06-05 16:11:28	@Espyo	haha
2016-06-05 16:11:29	Marty2000	I suppose we could also make a list of the different areas where you can find hiding spots
2016-06-05 16:11:47	@Espyo	eh, I don't know, it'd be a bit redundant
2016-06-05 16:11:52	@Espyo	you can just check the articles of the respective plants
2016-06-05 16:12:03	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 16:14:09	Marty2000	We already have images... lol
2016-06-05 16:14:13	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Vegetation#Sprout
2016-06-05 16:19:41	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGauQGnOQSM&feature=youtu.be Marty2000: do you have a reminder up to add this to the wiki once there's more info?
2016-06-05 16:20:45	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 16:20:54	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Hiding by Marty (+189 /* Gallery */) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=18445&diff=166395
2016-06-05 16:21:04	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6DWENeU_Ow&feature=youtu.be what about this?
2016-06-05 16:21:34	Marty2000	I already explained everything I knew about that to you, but it's not in my reminder
2016-06-05 16:21:52	@Espyo	you'll have to add it to the wiki
2016-06-05 16:22:12	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 16:22:13	@Espyo	the explanation is so tricky, too...
2016-06-05 16:22:17	@Espyo	if we could make it clearer one day, that'd be great
2016-06-05 16:22:25	Marty2000	That's what mostly prevent me from adding it :p
2016-06-05 16:22:30	@Espyo	well, when you come back to it and add it to the wiki, you might find a way to re-word it, and it might sound fine
2016-06-05 16:22:32	Marty2000	I'm trying to word it...
2016-06-05 16:22:57	Marty2000	Because it needs to be concise and short,
2016-06-05 16:23:08	Marty2000	but it must give as much information as possible
2016-06-05 16:23:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-05 16:23:27	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlL-qFt7w meanwhile, this guy died
2016-06-05 16:23:34	@Espyo	RIP the dream of finding out how he did it
2016-06-05 16:24:01	Marty2000	:/
2016-06-05 16:24:39	@Espyo	hm, ok, so
2016-06-05 16:24:46	@Espyo	on my todo list, there were these images I had to delete
2016-06-05 16:24:50	@Espyo	but I left them undeleted for some reason...
2016-06-05 16:24:52	Marty2000	Might check fast now since I'm in the Distant Tundra (I was taking screenshots until I saw that I was doing that for nothing :p )
2016-06-05 16:24:56	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:To_be_deleted these two
2016-06-05 16:25:03	@Espyo	I think I remember why not
2016-06-05 16:25:05	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-05 16:25:12	@Espyo	I didn't delete the small one because it shows Derpy Alph
2016-06-05 16:25:26	@Espyo	and I didn't delete the large one because it has a lot of DSL, which you can't find in the final game
2016-06-05 16:25:38	@Espyo	you never see more than, what, 6 DSL together, in the final
2016-06-05 16:25:48	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 16:25:58	Marty2000	Thirst Desert (BE!) has those 6
2016-06-05 16:26:01	Marty2000	Thirsty*
2016-06-05 16:27:34	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Seesaw_block&curid=1345&diff=166116&oldid=157731 help me out here
2016-06-05 16:27:51	@Espyo	you wrote this based on the fact that you can't have a Winged Pikmin weigh down a seesaw block, right?
2016-06-05 16:28:06	@Espyo	or did you manage to get a Winged Pikmin to walk on top of one, and discovered that the weight is still 0?
2016-06-05 16:28:35	Marty2000	The latter
2016-06-05 16:29:27	@Espyo	you should've expanded that
2016-06-05 16:29:32	Marty2000	When a Yellow Wollywog """crushes""" (not really, just thrown away) a WInged Pikmin, it runs a little before flying and attacking that
2016-06-05 16:29:33	@Espyo	because that info, as it is now, is really confusing
2016-06-05 16:29:40	@Espyo	hm
2016-06-05 16:29:41	Marty2000	When it runs, it still has no weigfht
2016-06-05 16:29:44	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 16:29:50	@Espyo	yeah, reworded it like that
2016-06-05 16:30:00	@Espyo	because it's really hard to get some sort of meaning from what is written right now
2016-06-05 16:30:12	@Espyo	and that's a really ingenious way of getting a Winged Pikmin to walk on it, I love it!
2016-06-05 16:31:06	Marty2000	Thanks :) I might try other things with that "walking Pikmin" discovery soon, I just need time to locate everything that allows me to get them
2016-06-05 16:31:12	Marty2000	I'm out of bounds now

2016-06-05 16:34:50	Marty2000	I see, yeah
2016-06-05 16:34:57	@Espyo	the egg images seem okay, but that one with the cracked egg is pretty dark...
2016-06-05 16:35:07	@Espyo	it's hard to see the cracks unless you open the image and take a closer look

2016-06-05 16:50:44	Marty2000	you can have walking Pikmin with the Puffy Blowhogs
2016-06-05 16:50:50	@Espyo	hm, makes sense
2016-06-05 16:51:14	Marty2000	(everything that can throw away Winged Pikmin, if you prefer)
2016-06-05 16:51:21	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-05 16:51:22	Marty2000	Like the Armored Cannon Larva's rocks...
2016-06-05 16:51:26	Marty2000	Works too
2016-06-05 16:51:52	@Espyo	I kept it general, saying that anything that can knock back a Winged Pikmin works to demonstrate the 0 weight
2016-06-05 16:52:02	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 16:52:12	Marty2000	Ah, you edited? I didn't see

2016-06-05 16:53:05	Marty2000	That's better
2016-06-05 16:53:10	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-05 16:53:21	@Espyo	on a different topic, some months ago, we discussed what we should do the infobox when we have enemies that only change slightly between games — if we should have a button for each look, or just use a single one
2016-06-05 16:53:27	@Espyo	we never reached a conclusion
2016-06-05 16:53:29	@Espyo	I thought about it a bit
2016-06-05 16:53:37	@Espyo	and I think it's better if we don't have a button unless the enemy changes a LOT
2016-06-05 16:53:40	@Espyo	like the Iridescent Flint Beetle
2016-06-05 16:53:46	@Espyo	I say this for two reasons
2016-06-05 16:53:59	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-05 16:54:03	@Espyo	one: you wouldn't have, on Wikipedia, an infobox of an adult singer as they look today, and as they looked 3 years ago
2016-06-05 16:54:14	@Espyo	even though they probably look different, with different colored hair, or different clothes
2016-06-05 16:54:17	@Espyo	it's still obviously the same person
2016-06-05 16:54:29	@Espyo	you don't need to show a lot of looks, if one is enough to identify the person
2016-06-05 16:54:50	@Espyo	if, however, it's an actor that's known for being a kid actor, it may make sense to show an image of the actor as a kid, and an image of the actor today
2016-06-05 16:55:02	@Espyo	since just showing the actor today might not make people recognize the actor as they were in their high days
2016-06-05 16:55:05	@Espyo	like the kid from Home Alone
2016-06-05 16:55:10	@Espyo	I think the same logic applies here
2016-06-05 16:55:15	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-05 16:55:22	@Espyo	just because the Water Dumple lost its whiskers for P2, it's still obviously the same enemy as the one in P1
2016-06-05 16:55:30	@Espyo	a single image is enough for anybody to recognize it
2016-06-05 16:55:36	@Espyo	two: it would complicate the page
2016-06-05 16:55:42	@Espyo	for us, understanding a page and how it works is simple
2016-06-05 16:55:48	@Espyo	we know what to read when we need it
2016-06-05 16:56:01	@Espyo	for the causal reader, when they enter an article, they're swarmed with stuff
2016-06-05 16:56:21	@Espyo	the headers at the top with the login buttons, the sidebar filled to the brim with all sorts of buttons and such
2016-06-05 16:56:36	@Espyo	and even the page itself has text, images, section headers, a table of contents, and a massive box at the right filled with misc. data
2016-06-05 16:56:42	@Espyo	it's quite the overload
2016-06-05 16:56:52	@Espyo	so complicating it EVEN further with buttons would probably be a bad idea
2016-06-05 16:56:55	@Espyo	we should avoid it if we acn
2016-06-05 16:56:56	@Espyo	*can
2016-06-05 16:57:07	@Espyo	and it even makes me think, maybe we can avoid it for the Iridescent Flint Beetle too
2016-06-05 16:57:11	Marty2000	I understand. 
2016-06-05 16:57:13	@Espyo	for one thing, like I said, the buttons complicate stuff
2016-06-05 16:57:26	@Espyo	secondly, in my opinion, it's not immediately noticeable that they're buttons
2016-06-05 16:57:32	@Espyo	so maybe simplifying everything is for the best
2016-06-05 16:57:35	@Espyo	these are my opinions, at least
2016-06-05 16:57:38	@Espyo	what do you think?
2016-06-05 16:58:08	@Espyo	I'll remove all of the buttons that only show slight changes, unless there are actually good reasons to keep the infobox with several looks
2016-06-05 16:59:16	Marty2000	I think you're right, and we can add the other images in the gallery, after all
2016-06-05 16:59:30	Marty2000	I'd just say that we should have the most recent look of the enemy in the infobox
2016-06-05 16:59:31	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-05 16:59:36	@Espyo	yeah, agreed
2016-06-05 17:01:08	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Hermit_Crawmad&curid=860&diff=162957&oldid=162606 I guess we can keep this, though
2016-06-05 17:01:34	@Espyo	in P2, they have all of these weird joints, and look like they have an impenetrable shrimp-like head
2016-06-05 17:01:49	@Espyo	and there's a lot of green, the eyes aren't in stalks, and most of all, they don't have those claws
2016-06-05 17:01:52	@Espyo	in P3, it's different
2016-06-05 17:02:13	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-05 17:04:39	Marty2000	I'm still trying to think of something else we could add in the Seed article
2016-06-05 17:05:06	Marty2000	On the one hand, I want to make it... on the other hand, I'm sure we have to add more things

2016-06-05 17:05:46	Marty2000	I have to record
2016-06-05 17:06:05	@Espyo	plus the whole mess between "the object that comes out from the Onion" and "a Pikmin under the ground"
2016-06-05 17:06:28	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-05 17:06:35	Marty2000	Okay, so my "new" glitch
2016-06-05 17:06:51	Marty2000	If a Pikmin tries to take a berry the moment it disappears...
2016-06-05 17:07:06	Marty2000	The Pikmin will hold nothing, and will bring nothing to the S.S. Drake
2016-06-05 17:07:16	Marty2000	That's quite strange...
2016-06-05 17:07:41	@Espyo	woah!
2016-06-05 17:07:52	@Espyo	that sounds frame-perfect
2016-06-05 17:08:16	Marty2000	I don't know, I was trying to push a berry to a seesaw block

2016-06-05 17:08:43	@Espyo	right
2016-06-05 17:14:37	Marty2000	Hmm, by the way, about the Sunseed Berry having a weight of 15 in the Beastly Caverns... maybe it's a special property only given to that piece of fruit? Like the HPs that can change
2016-06-05 17:15:03	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-05 17:15:06	@Espyo	I think I tried searching

2016-06-05 19:06:22	Yoshi2	iirc espernet by itself is not a big network, but it is basically minecraft central with its biggest channels being minecraft related
2016-06-05 19:07:07	@Espyo	heh, I bet

2016-06-05 19:41:20	Marty2000	Hmm... you have more range though
2016-06-05 19:41:38	Marty2000	But lags can contribute to the Bubbler's ictory, yeah...
2016-06-05 19:41:51	@PikFan	I guess, but I usually get splatted when I try to knock back a Bubbler
2016-06-05 19:42:06	Marty2000	It's probably because of lag, and yeah, happens to me too
