2016-06-28 11:53:49	Yoshi2	Klemen702: what do you want to do
2016-06-28 11:54:16	Yoshi2	if it's something on a website, you need to have the flash plugin installed (or you use chrome which comes with a flash plugin)
2016-06-28 11:54:35	Yoshi2	if you have a swf file you need to download adobe's projector thing (stand alone flash player)
2016-06-28 11:54:36	Klemen702	if i'm correct flash is also ''openable'' right?
2016-06-28 11:55:12	Yoshi2	what do you mean by openable? Do you want to decompile it or do you want to run it?
2016-06-28 11:55:20	Klemen702	run it
2016-06-28 11:55:39	Klemen702	to interact with it
2016-06-28 11:56:02	Yoshi2	if you have a .swf file you need the stand alone flash player 
2016-06-28 11:56:42	Klemen702	where can i do that
2016-06-28 11:57:44	Klemen702	use the stand alone i mean

2016-06-28 19:30:26	@Espyo	as usual, if adding images won't add anything to the reader's knowledge or even satisfaction, then no, we shouldn't
2016-06-28 19:30:28	@Espyo	they'd just add up space
2016-06-28 19:30:35	@Espyo	not sure if adding images of caves would benefit anybody
2016-06-28 19:30:41	@Espyo	not really, in my opinion
2016-06-28 19:30:47	@Espyo	maybe for some of the more gimmicky caves

2016-06-28 19:34:55	@Espyo	yeah, especially since the layout of caves is randomly generated...
2016-06-28 19:35:22	Marty2000	Well, for the layout, I meant, the fruits or enemies, but yeah, that's true

2016-06-28 21:52:10	Marty2000	Question: will Testyo stop writing in caps when it's midnight (for you, Espyo)?
2016-06-28 21:52:10	Testyo	HMM
2016-06-28 21:52:33	@Espyo	he only changes "modes" when he boots
2016-06-28 21:52:40	@Espyo	so if I boot him after my midnight, yep
2016-06-28 21:52:42	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-28 22:04:15	Marty2000	Well, I'm going to continue yesterday's science. I could get a time for one red Pikmin: let me check my reminder...
2016-06-28 22:05:23	Marty2000	To take down one third of the first gate on the Valley of Repose, a red Pikmin needs 11:53 min
2016-06-28 22:08:21	Marty2000	Trying with 2 red Pikmin right now.
2016-06-28 22:14:19	Marty2000	2 red Pikmin = 5:56 min.
2016-06-28 22:14:25	Marty2000	Going to try with 3
2016-06-28 22:20:04	Marty2000	3 red Pikmin = 3:57 min.
2016-06-28 22:20:11	Marty2000	I'm gonna try with 4.
2016-06-28 22:23:00	@Espyo	ah, yes
2016-06-28 22:25:07	Marty2000	4 Pikmin = 2:58 min.
2016-06-28 22:25:10	Marty2000	5 now
2016-06-28 22:30:37	Marty2000	5 Pikmin = 2:23 min. Seems to diminish...

2016-06-28 22:34:24	Marty2000	6 Pikmin = 1:59 min.

2016-06-28 23:00:42	Scruffy	Marty2000, what are you testing?
2016-06-28 23:02:01	Marty2000	20 Pikmin = 36 sec. Scruffy: we are trying to see if there is consistency when Pikmin try to destroy gates (for example, we want to see if 2 Pikmin are twice as fast as 1 P, 20 are twenty times as fast...) and:
2016-06-28 23:02:13	@Espyo	mind if I do it then?
2016-06-28 23:02:17	Marty2000	It's consistent in P3, but not in P1, so I'm checking in P2
2016-06-28 23:02:29	Scruffy	Not at all! Go right ahead, thank you!
2016-06-28 23:02:33	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-28 23:02:39	@Espyo	was it linear with 100 in P3, Marty?
2016-06-28 23:03:17	Marty2000	I couldn't test, you cannot grow enough Pikmin for that gate :p But I might try with another gate... when I come back
2016-06-28 23:03:27	Marty2000	But it was linear with 20 Pikmin, yeah
2016-06-28 23:05:46	@Espyo	hm, I thought it wasn't in P3
2016-06-28 23:05:47	@Espyo	sorry
2016-06-28 23:07:49	Marty2000	No problem. 30 Pikmin =24 sec.
2016-06-28 23:09:31	Marty2000	40 Pikmin = 18 sec.
2016-06-28 23:10:03	Scruffy	Aww man, I found a way to change what parts of a White Pikmin's armature affect which parts of the geometry in P2
2016-06-28 23:10:17	Scruffy	But once I call out one White Pikmin the game sort of crashes
2016-06-28 23:10:30	Scruffy	I mean it still runs, but it gives me an error every frame
2016-06-28 23:11:30	Marty2000	Oh :/
2016-06-28 23:11:36	Marty2000	50 Pikmin = 15 sec.
2016-06-28 23:12:40	Scruffy	Although from what I saw the White Pikmin no longer had anything on top of its stem
2016-06-28 23:13:26	Marty2000	60 Pikmin = 12 sec.
2016-06-28 23:13:28	Marty2000	I see

2016-06-28 23:15:45	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-28 23:16:22	Marty2000	Espyo: seems quite linear, doesn't it?
2016-06-28 23:17:56	Marty2000	80 Pikmin = 9 sec.
2016-06-28 23:18:45	@Espyo	what, in P3?
2016-06-28 23:18:50	@Espyo	can't tell which game you're doing now :P
2016-06-28 23:18:52	Marty2000	I'm in P2
2016-06-28 23:19:05	Marty2000	I did P3 yesterday :p
2016-06-28 23:19:13	Marty2000	and P1
2016-06-28 23:20:00	Marty2000	The logs have been updated tonight if you want to check the results I got, by the way
2016-06-28 23:20:29	Marty2000	90 Pikmin = 7 sec
2016-06-28 23:20:38	Marty2000	Now, 100.
2016-06-28 23:23:18	Marty2000	Hmm... 100 Pikmin = 7 sec as well
2016-06-28 23:24:52	Scruffy	Woah, found the animation manager for leaders in P2
2016-06-28 23:25:36	Scruffy	I've apparently made Pikmin unthrowable by lengthening the throwing animation
2016-06-28 23:26:00	Marty2000	Wow
2016-06-28 23:28:20	Marty2000	I see there 's "Moray Towers" on the current rotation. Are there a lot of chargers, Espyo? Because if so, then, this is perfect for trying my Bomb Range Up :p
2016-06-28 23:28:31	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-28 23:28:33	@Espyo	we got bombarded
2016-06-28 23:28:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-28 23:29:08	Marty2000	Then, I will be merciless
2016-06-28 23:31:38	@Espyo	:D
2016-06-28 23:34:17	Scruffy	okay, I'm starting to make some sense of this using leaders' "punch," "punch2," and "punch3" animations
2016-06-28 23:34:32	Scruffy	They're the three punches you can use with the rocket glove
2016-06-28 23:34:45	Scruffy	Each animation has two numbers immediately below them
2016-06-28 23:34:57	Scruffy	For the first punches the numbers are "2 2"
2016-06-28 23:35:04	Scruffy	For the third it's "8 2"
2016-06-28 23:35:12	Scruffy	first two punches*
2016-06-28 23:35:38	Scruffy	You would think the first number is how many frames it is
2016-06-28 23:35:48	Scruffy	But apparently not so
2016-06-28 23:36:02	Scruffy	It's how many frames before the punch actually causes damage
2016-06-28 23:36:03	@Espyo	ooh
2016-06-28 23:36:08	@Espyo	could be hitbox size
2016-06-28 23:36:11	@Espyo	or damage caused?
2016-06-28 23:36:17	Scruffy	Not damage caused
2016-06-28 23:36:31	Marty2000	I see, interesting
2016-06-28 23:36:33	Scruffy	If it's /higher/ than the amount of frames the animation lasts, the punch will do nothing
2016-06-28 23:36:41	Scruffy	I think it's how long before the hitbox appears
2016-06-28 23:37:03	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-28 23:37:22	Scruffy	But I don't know what the second number does, it could possibly be hitbox size but I'm still testing
2016-06-28 23:37:51	Scruffy	Damage caused is handled in the NaviParms.txt file
2016-06-28 23:40:43	Scruffy	Okay, interesting
2016-06-28 23:40:58	Scruffy	I changed the second numbers in punch and punch3 to 8
2016-06-28 23:40:58	@Espyo	ooh
2016-06-28 23:41:06	Scruffy	and then to 0
2016-06-28 23:41:14	Scruffy	punch2 was my control value
2016-06-28 23:41:25	Scruffy	and both times, only punch2 caused any damage
2016-06-28 23:41:30	Scruffy	No matter how much I punched
2016-06-28 23:41:50	Scruffy	So I don't know what that second number controls, but if it isn't two in that situation it doesn't seem to work
2016-06-28 23:41:56	Scruffy	It's different in other animations though
2016-06-28 23:43:39	Scruffy	It could be an identifier numbe
2016-06-28 23:43:41	Scruffy	number*
2016-06-28 23:44:12	Scruffy	Mmm not likely, in some animations like "walk" there are five pairs of numbers
2016-06-28 23:44:56	Scruffy	10 0, 10 200, 20 201, 30 1, 30 200

2016-06-30 20:31:43	CraftedPbody	Espyo, do we have an overhead of the unused version of the perplexing pool? The one that was used as the Piklopedia map.
2016-06-30 20:31:58	@Espyo	that's not really unused, but yeah

2016-06-30 20:33:33	CraftedPbody	By unused, I mean how it was the prototype for the storymode, but got replaced and is now used in the piklopedia, but anyway thanks. I wanted to look at it.
2016-06-30 20:33:57	CraftedPbody	I don't know why they didn't keep this one...
2016-06-30 20:34:37	CraftedPbody	It looks more open than the one that ended up in the final version

2016-06-30 20:35:44	@Espyo	the only different thing is the landing site
2016-06-30 20:35:49	@Espyo	it looks kinda plain
2016-06-30 20:36:13	CraftedPbody	no, the landing site was in a different spot.
2016-06-30 20:36:25	@Espyo	am I missing something?
2016-06-30 20:36:33	@Espyo	I thought this layout was never used for anything except the Piklopedia
2016-06-30 20:37:27	CraftedPbody	You can see in some images of pikmin 2 before it was release where olimar is walking around in this version

2016-06-30 20:37:49	@Espyo	I don't remember it
2016-06-30 20:37:53	@Espyo	do we have it on the wiki?
2016-06-30 20:37:54	CraftedPbody	also, the landing site was going to be on the tree stump where you find the yellows

2016-06-30 20:38:01	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-06-30 20:38:06	@Espyo	makes sense, since it's the center of the map
2016-06-30 20:40:31	CraftedPbody	either the yellows, a cave, or the burgeoning spiderworts would be found in the spot that eventually became the new landing site.
2016-06-30 20:40:44	@Espyo	right
2016-06-30 20:40:52	@Espyo	it's too important for it to not be one of those things
2016-06-30 20:40:57	@Espyo	wait, maybe a boss?
2016-06-30 20:40:59	@Espyo	Beady Long Legs
2016-06-30 20:41:05	CraftedPbody	oh
2016-06-30 20:41:07	CraftedPbody	Right
2016-06-30 20:41:13	CraftedPbody	Yeah, could be
2016-06-30 20:42:18	CraftedPbody	actually, the fact that you can walk down to the onion replica instead of having to throw pikmin makes me want to believe that might have been where the citadel of spiders was and that the beady long legs was on that top platform.
2016-06-30 20:42:56	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-06-30 20:43:02	CraftedPbody	odd...
2016-06-30 20:43:14	CraftedPbody	What's with the crack in the ground?
2016-06-30 20:43:25	CraftedPbody	That would normally indicate a drain.
2016-06-30 20:43:35	@Espyo	yeah, but it doesn't make a whole load of sense
2016-06-30 20:43:39	CraftedPbody	but that spot shouldn't have water...
2016-06-30 20:44:35	CraftedPbody	Wait, could it be that that was a puzzle where you'd take blues to drain that small puddle and then go with whites and dig something up?
2016-06-30 20:44:57	@Espyo	maybe, yeah
2016-06-30 20:45:01	CraftedPbody	but, that spot should be flat.

2016-06-30 20:47:08	@Espyo	hm, maybe, but it'd be kinda pointless
2016-06-30 20:47:47	CraftedPbody	no, there would be a path there
2016-06-30 20:48:58	CraftedPbody	let me see if I can piece together how this might have been...  one moment...

2016-06-30 20:54:51	@Espyo	I've done this research before

2016-06-30 20:55:08	@Espyo	so maybe some tiny stuff might be missing, but *shrug*

2016-06-30 21:04:27	CraftedPbody	Wait... What spots do treasures appear in the piklopedia?
2016-06-30 21:04:38	CraftedPbody	in the treasure hoard
2016-06-30 21:16:26	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/8dc585a9ee923fa177fa10e835b5f65e.png ok how's this? Does this look correct?
2016-06-30 21:18:25	@Espyo	yeah, I'd say so
2016-06-30 21:18:38	@Espyo	dunno, I think each treasure has its spawn point
2016-06-30 21:19:06	@Espyo	seems odd that the landing site would be blocked off by a gate right away
2016-06-30 21:19:21	CraftedPbody	forest of hope
2016-06-30 21:19:31	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that
2016-06-30 21:19:34	@Espyo	but that's the tutorial stage
2016-06-30 21:19:40	@Espyo	doesn't make sense to do that in the late-game
2016-06-30 21:19:43	CraftedPbody	forest navel
2016-06-30 21:19:55	@Espyo	you can explore a lot of TFN without opening a gate
2016-06-30 21:20:24	CraftedPbody	true, but the gate here would only stop treasures
2016-06-30 21:20:48	CraftedPbody	the player would still be able to walk in and out as they please.
2016-06-30 21:20:57	@Espyo	oh yeah, there's another way
2016-06-30 21:21:00	@Espyo	well, OUT, at least
2016-06-30 21:21:06	@Espyo	I think there's a ledge
2016-06-30 21:21:09	@Espyo	dunno if you can go back in
2016-06-30 21:21:14	CraftedPbody	yeah
2016-06-30 21:21:22	CraftedPbody	the area isn't fully walled off.
2016-06-30 21:21:32	CraftedPbody	it's a slope in this version
2016-06-30 21:22:01	CraftedPbody	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnwmgXZVqPc
2016-06-30 21:22:21	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-06-30 21:23:07	CraftedPbody	oh
2016-06-30 21:23:20	CraftedPbody	I think there was also a bridge near the landing.
2016-06-30 21:23:45	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/76674b100849e8810ad5e4d7abf82649.png What do you think?
2016-06-30 21:24:02	@Espyo	it's so flat
2016-06-30 21:24:06	@Espyo	but it looks like it's one-way only
2016-06-30 21:24:45	CraftedPbody	In 1 there was a geyser and a stick here because the tall wall, but here it looks like a bridge could be built here.
2016-06-30 21:25:01	@Espyo	right
2016-06-30 21:27:48	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/9aaf8e27ce82b4dae825f34ab8f0da8f.png
2016-06-30 21:28:16	@Espyo	seems right
2016-06-30 21:28:55	CraftedPbody	That short-cut makes sense... otherwise it'd be a long trip with a treasure.
2016-06-30 21:29:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-30 21:29:56	CraftedPbody	even though, there really isn't any wall really to stop the pikmin from just carrying in treasures...
2016-06-30 21:30:09	CraftedPbody	they could just walk up the slope.
2016-06-30 21:31:06	CraftedPbody	oh, there is a pool of water there...
2016-06-30 21:31:21	CraftedPbody	At the base of what became the new landing spot
2016-06-30 21:31:41	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-30 21:31:59	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/a81a18e88dcc1a97048a83a10ae7a480.png
2016-06-30 21:32:31	CraftedPbody	weird...
2016-06-30 21:32:50	CraftedPbody	so, a treasure may have been here...
2016-06-30 21:33:00	CraftedPbody	or possibly a bridge?
2016-06-30 21:33:15	CraftedPbody	Probably a treasure
2016-06-30 21:33:45	@Espyo	maybe
2016-06-30 21:33:53	CraftedPbody	in that case... it could be...
2016-06-30 21:33:58	CraftedPbody	one moment.

2016-06-30 21:35:37	CraftedPbody	This may be it
2016-06-30 21:36:59	CraftedPbody	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMJdjmYkGD8 is there any reason this is here?

2016-06-30 21:37:22	@Espyo	seems likely
2016-06-30 21:37:28	@Espyo	boo, Klemen702
2016-06-30 21:37:43	CraftedPbody	the red and blue were in their usual spots

2016-06-30 21:42:18	CraftedPbody	So that's where yellows would probably be.
2016-06-30 21:42:55	@Espyo	right

2016-06-30 22:11:51	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-30 22:11:57	@Espyo	hehe, you managed to connect
2016-06-30 22:11:59	@Espyo	how are things there?
2016-06-30 22:12:15	Scruffy	Great so far
2016-06-30 22:12:33	@Espyo	great to hear
2016-06-30 22:12:34	Scruffy	The weather is very nice, the people are friendly, the food is excellent
2016-06-30 22:12:46	@Espyo	looks like you're having better luck with the weather than I am
2016-06-30 22:12:55	Scruffy	And the other composers I've met really know their stuff
2016-06-30 22:12:58	@Espyo	these past few days are so warm, but today sucked
2016-06-30 22:13:08	@Espyo	really? great
2016-06-30 22:13:09	Scruffy	I can tell we'll bounce ideas off of each other well
2016-06-30 22:13:13	Scruffy	aww, sorry to hear that
2016-06-30 22:13:18	@Espyo	that really is great
2016-06-30 22:13:22	@Espyo	eh, I'll live :V
2016-06-30 22:13:58	@Espyo	so you went there purposely to meet up with other composers?
2016-06-30 22:14:00	Scruffy	But yeah, the hotel I'm staying at has fast WiFi, so it looks like I'll be able to stay in touch
2016-06-30 22:14:05	Scruffy	When I'm not busy, of course
2016-06-30 22:14:08	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-06-30 22:14:19	@Espyo	no big projects at the moment, so no pressure
2016-06-30 22:14:24	Scruffy	Yeah, it's a workshop where we all compose pieces and meet in seminars to discuss and edit them

2016-06-30 22:16:38	Scruffy	Not too bad, I got sleep on the flights over here
2016-06-30 22:16:39	Marty1401	1 hour from me and 2 from Espyo and Yoshi2 :p

2016-06-30 22:17:49	Scruffy	Just met the other composers over dinner and explored the city
2016-06-30 22:17:59	Marty1401	I see
2016-06-30 22:18:00	Scruffy	And I tried white wine for the first time
2016-06-30 22:18:25	Marty1401	He he
2016-06-30 22:18:32	Scruffy	It was an interesting flavor, and goes very well with Greek food
2016-06-30 22:18:47	Marty1401	Nice
2016-06-30 22:24:13	Marty1401	Oh... Splatoon will have its last Splatfest already!
2016-06-30 22:24:39	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-30 22:24:42	@Espyo	Callie vs Marie
2016-06-30 22:24:48	Marty1401	It's a hard choice, but I will vote for Callie
2016-06-30 22:24:53	@Espyo	same
2016-06-30 22:25:10	@Espyo	it's kinda harsh
2016-06-30 22:25:20	@Espyo	this was hinted at by the last US Splatfest's results
2016-06-30 22:25:22	Marty1401	Too bad, the game is
2016-06-30 22:25:27	Marty1401	still... recent
2016-06-30 22:25:30	Marty1401	Yes
2016-06-30 22:25:36	@Espyo	the two just started bickering against one another while announcing the results
2016-06-30 22:25:39	@Espyo	it was irksome to see
2016-06-30 22:25:43	@Espyo	yeah, it's too young to stop now
2016-06-30 22:25:59	@Espyo	but Nintendo, being clumsy at networking as they are, probably die a bit every time they set up a Splatfest
2016-06-30 22:26:02	@Espyo	their servers are always a mess
2016-06-30 22:26:06	Marty1401	By the way, on Inkipedia, you can see the results if Early Bird had won
2016-06-30 22:26:09	@Espyo	and their staff team for ideas isn't honestly the best...
2016-06-30 22:26:17	@Espyo	yeah, I eventually read what they'd be elsewhere
2016-06-30 22:26:21	Marty1401	I see.
2016-06-30 22:26:22	@Espyo	so it's already on Inkipedia? nice
2016-06-30 22:26:30	Marty1401	Yep

2016-06-30 22:27:09	@Espyo	http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splatfest/Quotes see it
2016-06-30 22:27:22	Marty1401	I'm happy, though, that it only starts in a few weeks
2016-06-30 22:27:33	Marty1401	Well, it also lasts 48h
2016-06-30 22:27:55	@Espyo	oh, Spanish says the same too
2016-06-30 22:27:58	@Espyo	well, I figured it would, but
2016-06-30 22:28:07	@Espyo	oh, lasts two days?
2016-06-30 22:28:08	@Espyo	didn't know that

2016-07-01 08:47:43	Marty1401	Thanks
2016-07-01 08:48:40	Yoshi2	because of the onscreen keyboard, or is mibbit just not great?
2016-07-01 08:48:57	Marty1401	Onscreen keyboard
2016-07-01 08:49:36	UltraMario	yeah
2016-07-01 08:49:44	UltraMario	it like covers the whole screen
2016-07-01 08:49:51	UltraMario	what kind of phone do you have, an android?
2016-07-01 08:50:16	Marty1401	Huawei. I nearly never use my phone
2016-07-01 08:50:22	UltraMario	o

2016-07-01 08:53:57	Marty1401	I won't have mods, though
2016-07-01 08:54:04	Yoshi2	you could watch one youtube video per day and still have left-over internet
2016-07-01 08:54:40	Marty1401	Unless those videos are five hours long :p
2016-07-01 08:55:16	Marty1401	Unless I decide to listen to Kirby Falcon Punch 10 hours, yeah
2016-07-01 08:56:09	Marty1401	Anyway, I have to go... I may connect in 13 hours

2016-07-01 19:11:12	Marty1401	Anything new about Pikmin science those days?
2016-07-01 19:11:21	@Espyo	not really
2016-07-01 19:11:28	@Espyo	I made this [[User:Espyo/Sandbox]]
2016-07-01 19:11:28	Testyo	"User:Espyo/Sandbox" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Espyo/Sandbox
2016-07-01 19:11:42	Marty1401	I'm going to check, thanks
2016-07-01 19:13:10	@Espyo	still a WIP, thoguh
2016-07-01 19:13:12	@Espyo	*though
2016-07-01 19:13:35	Marty1401	Nice! It could fit perfectly in an article or the Glitches article, when you've added more information
2016-07-01 19:14:05	@Espyo	it's tough... it's hard to define the line between "a well known, but important to bust myth" (like Winged Pikmin being stronger) and just "a small weirdness some players have" (like thinking Dwarf Red Bulborbs are young Bulborbs, which is kinda purposeful)
2016-07-01 19:14:07	@Espyo	glitches?
2016-07-01 19:14:09	Marty1401	"It was long theorized that Blue Pikmin in Pikmin 2 are more likely to be picked when an enemy lunges at the player's group. This was never proven to be true nor false." Yeah, and even though I cannot certify it's true....
2016-07-01 19:14:20	Marty1401	I believe it is
2016-07-01 19:14:27	@Espyo	I never saw anything of the sort...
2016-07-01 19:14:50	@Espyo	well, guess that's the next experiment, huh
2016-07-01 19:14:54	Marty1401	When you try, well, I think it becomes apparent
2016-07-01 19:14:59	@Espyo	I did try, in the past
2016-07-01 19:15:05	@Espyo	it didn't become apparent whatsoever :/
2016-07-01 19:15:10	Marty1401	I see
2016-07-01 19:15:22	Marty1401	Yeah, this is the next thing to solve
2016-07-01 19:15:29	@Espyo	great, I'm excited
2016-07-01 19:15:33	@Espyo	this is another mystery I want to see put to rest
2016-07-01 19:15:41	@Espyo	which also highlights the importance of a "myths" page
2016-07-01 19:15:48	@Espyo	people need to know if common myths are true or not
2016-07-01 19:15:51	@Espyo	so misinformation isn't spread
2016-07-01 19:15:56	@Espyo	on that note, can you remember any more myths?
2016-07-01 19:16:02	Marty1401	... but we will have to wait :p I just cannot use videos for that 
2016-07-01 19:16:08	@Espyo	particularly, myths that people believed but ended up being TRUE?
2016-07-01 19:16:09	Marty1401	Thinking about it....
2016-07-01 19:16:21	Marty1401	I'm trying to remember...
2016-07-01 19:17:16	@Espyo	take your time
2016-07-01 19:17:55	Marty1401	Hmm... what was written for the leader switch glitch (Pikmin 2 caves) before we discover the truth?
2016-07-01 19:18:01	Marty1401	discovered?
2016-07-01 19:18:06	Marty1401	Thanks
2016-07-01 19:19:06	@Espyo	I think it just said it was random
2016-07-01 19:19:12	@Espyo	but either way, I don't think it's a common misconception
2016-07-01 19:19:21	@Espyo	only you and me ever noticed that the leaders switching was a thing :P
2016-07-01 19:19:40	Marty1401	He he, indeed
2016-07-01 19:20:20	Marty1401	The best thing would be to check Pikmin Wikia in general too :p
2016-07-01 19:21:12	@Espyo	hah!
2016-07-01 19:21:15	@Espyo	sad but true :/
2016-07-01 19:22:29	Marty1401	Unless... let me check something. When I was younger, I used to go on a French Pikmin forum with lots of theory... 
2016-07-01 19:22:49	@Espyo	right
2016-07-01 19:23:46	Yoshi2	on the BW front, I implemented a very basic feature
2016-07-01 19:23:50	Yoshi2	multiple selection box
2016-07-01 19:23:54	Yoshi2	or rather, the drawing of it
2016-07-01 19:24:04	Marty1401	I see
2016-07-01 19:24:27	Yoshi2	it doesn't work yet but it is oh so satisfying dragging the mouse around and making the selection box
2016-07-01 19:24:55	@Espyo	hehehe, I know that feeling
2016-07-01 19:25:09	Marty1401	The President's name? Espyo
2016-07-01 19:25:19	Marty1401	Snacho or something like that
2016-07-01 19:25:26	@Espyo	maybe
2016-07-01 19:25:36	@Espyo	but see, that's another thing, just how popular is that as a mistake people make
2016-07-01 19:25:37	@Espyo	*?
2016-07-01 19:26:47	Marty1401	I think it's popular amongst players who played the game... but I cannot be sure :(

2016-07-02 11:18:43	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-07-02 11:18:43	Testyo	anyway, I know quite a few don't know, I've found all sorts of ideas on the look of the boss, but nothing about the boss itself
2016-07-02 11:18:51	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-02 11:22:51	Yoshi2	I am glad I made a catch_exception decorator
2016-07-02 11:23:30	@Espyo	is half of your code only working because you're ignoring caught exceptions?
2016-07-02 11:24:31	Yoshi2	:^)
2016-07-02 11:24:42	Yoshi2	heh, no
2016-07-02 11:24:57	Yoshi2	half my code doesn't break because I am ignoring caught exceptions
2016-07-02 11:25:00	Yoshi2	big difference
2016-07-02 11:25:15	@Espyo	ah, good
2016-07-02 11:25:25	Yoshi2	but I print the exception to the terminal
2016-07-02 11:25:51	Yoshi2	and where I ignore the exception, it isn't critical
2016-07-02 11:25:55	@Espyo	of course
2016-07-02 11:27:06	Yoshi2	i feel like the god of the world
2016-07-02 11:27:16	@Espyo	there's nothing that can stop you
2016-07-02 11:27:20	Yoshi2	added code for moving multiple selected objects
2016-07-02 11:27:25	Yoshi2	and it actually works
2016-07-02 11:27:25	@Espyo	and that which can is getting silently redirected to a terminal
2016-07-02 11:27:39	@Espyo	that's scary
2016-07-02 11:27:43	@Espyo	it will break eventually
2016-07-02 11:27:59	Yoshi2	I have a guinea pig who will help testing
2016-07-02 11:28:20	Yoshi2	he was also the one to suggest (or rather, support) multiple object selections
2016-07-02 11:28:54	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-07-02 11:28:58	@Espyo	that's the thing about having a QC department
2016-07-02 11:29:02	@Espyo	you can make as crappy a code as you want
2016-07-02 11:29:06	@Espyo	if it gets to release, it's QC's fault
2016-07-02 11:29:29	Yoshi2	I had the idea of multiple selections before, but because "Meh, who needs it, seems too much effort" I didn't do it
2016-07-02 11:29:48	Yoshi2	turns out it isn't THAT much effort and somebody actually would like to have that
2016-07-02 11:30:15	@Espyo	yeah, it's tricky to say for sure what others do and don't want
2016-07-02 11:30:25	@Espyo	you could just play it safe and add a bunch of features
2016-07-02 11:30:40	@Espyo	but then the code becomes slow and messy, the interface is all clogged, and you introduced more bugs than you've made life easier for people
2016-07-02 11:31:43	Yoshi2	the way the moving of multiple objects works is that I calculate the biggest and smallest position in the selected objects
2016-07-02 11:32:03	Yoshi2	I calculate the middle of that and then I calculate the delta between the middle and the spot the user clicks
2016-07-02 11:32:08	Yoshi2	and move all objects by that delta
2016-07-02 11:32:43	@Espyo	hm, it works, but can't you check deltas by the mouse's dragging distance?
2016-07-02 11:35:49	Yoshi2	don't think so, because what would be the starting point from where I should check the dragging distance?
2016-07-02 11:36:43	Yoshi2	the user makes a selection box around the objects he wants to move, then he turns on Move Objects, and then he clicks where the objects should be moved to
2016-07-02 11:37:11	Yoshi2	I do use the distance from mouse dragging for scrolling
2016-07-02 11:40:46	@Espyo	oh, so even with one single unit selected, you move it by clicking on the final spot in Move Objects move?
2016-07-02 11:42:13	Yoshi2	yup
2016-07-02 11:42:34	Yoshi2	there is no moving objects by dragging
2016-07-02 11:43:54	@Espyo	ah, okay
2016-07-02 11:44:22	Yoshi2	all of this is probably a bit simplistic but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
2016-07-02 11:44:42	@Espyo	hey, if it works, it's fine for now

2016-07-02 12:09:23	Yoshi2	from some testing, it works
2016-07-02 12:10:01	Yoshi2	basically, I just took the existing code and instead of deleting the current entity, it either adds the current entity to a list or extends a list with all selected entities, and then iterates over that list and does stuff

2016-07-02 12:40:26	Yoshi2	oh my god how did I miss this
2016-07-02 12:40:51	Yoshi2	basically, the item I add is formatted like entity_string = get_type(entityobj.type)+entityobj.type+entityobj.id
2016-07-02 12:41:15	Yoshi2	and when I iterate over the list to add the new item in a sorted way, it is currstring = get_type(currobj.type)+currobj.type
2016-07-02 12:42:14	@Espyo	hah
2016-07-02 12:42:21	@Espyo	see, this is what design patterns are all about
2016-07-02 12:42:37	@Espyo	unfun, obnoxiously stiff ways to organize your code, that end up saving you headaches
2016-07-02 12:44:38	Yoshi2	what design patterns would save me headaches?
2016-07-02 12:45:35	@Espyo	thankfully I don't know all of them
2016-07-02 12:45:44	@Espyo	but something object-oriented that has a toString() method
2016-07-02 12:45:48	@Espyo	that would do that for you
2016-07-02 12:45:58	@Espyo	instead of you having to piece together the parts of the string by hand every time
2016-07-02 12:46:53	Yoshi2	I could plug that into the class entityobj is an instance of
2016-07-02 12:47:52	@Espyo	yeha
2016-07-02 12:47:54	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-07-02 12:48:04	Yoshi2	well, there are other places that would profit much more from refactoring

2016-07-02 18:26:01	Yoshi2	now I'm curious
2016-07-02 18:26:03	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2016-07-02 18:26:03	Testyo	I said did the FA box from unpredictable (nsfw) because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages did the FA box always have a tooltip? and that was far from unpredictable (nsfw).
2016-07-02 18:26:11	Yoshi2	disappointing

2016-07-02 22:39:10	Scruffy	I saw the new news on Pikipedia about the live streaming. I wish I could tune in, but I'll probably be pretty busy at the time
2016-07-02 22:39:27	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-02 22:39:32	@Espyo	it's okay
2016-07-02 22:39:38	@Espyo	I probably won't be watching it either

2016-07-02 22:41:06	Scruffy	Well that's pretty neat though, it'll probably get some good publicity
2016-07-02 22:41:45	Scruffy	I may set up a SoundCloud soon, and show the pieces I legally own
2016-07-02 22:41:59	Scruffy	And i'll link you to it when I do
2016-07-02 22:42:18	Scruffy	I had reservations because I didn't want anyone stealing the piece off SoundCloud
2016-07-02 22:42:50	Scruffy	But I've figured out it's a rather safe site, plus no one would really want to steal this abstract contemporary stuff
2016-07-02 22:43:25	@Espyo	ooh, yeah
2016-07-02 22:43:42	@Espyo	reservations?
2016-07-02 22:44:45	Scruffy	I was worried about it
2016-07-02 22:45:49	Scruffy	But I feel it'll be fine, I'll set it up when I have some free time
2016-07-02 22:47:31	@Espyo	I don't get what a reservation is
2016-07-02 22:47:36	@Espyo	in the context of SoundCloud
2016-07-02 22:48:08	Scruffy	oh, "having a reservation" is just a phrase for being worried about something
2016-07-02 22:48:18	Scruffy	It doesn't relate to SoundCloud, it'
2016-07-02 22:48:20	Scruffy	it
2016-07-02 22:48:27	Scruffy	it's just an English idiom*
2016-07-02 22:52:21	@Espyo	oh
2016-07-02 22:52:23	@Espyo	wow, I never heard that
2016-07-02 22:52:42	@Espyo	I think SoundCloud is limited, though
2016-07-02 22:52:46	@Espyo	only around 3 hours of audio for free
2016-07-02 22:53:08	Scruffy	My pieces are less than 15 minutes total, I think
2016-07-02 22:53:21	Scruffy	So that ought to be fine for now
2016-07-02 22:55:07	Yoshi2	Espyo: hm, more commonly I hear "having a reservation about something"
2016-07-02 22:55:28	Scruffy	But right now I need to head to bed, it's almost 1
2016-07-02 22:55:38	@Espyo	hmm
2016-07-02 22:55:41	@Espyo	yeah, you better go

2016-07-02 22:56:14	Yoshi2	"yeah, you better go" -says the one who will stay up until at least 1
2016-07-02 22:56:20	@Espyo	YOUR 1

2016-07-02 22:56:36	@Espyo	saw this video some days back
2016-07-02 22:56:41	@Espyo	it was great

2016-07-04 21:21:00	Yoshi2	don't scare me like that, Testyo :<
2016-07-04 21:21:01	Testyo	so he should've saved some already
2016-07-04 21:21:02	@Espyo	|:
2016-07-04 21:26:36	Yoshi2	my search on bgf turned up the following
2016-07-04 21:27:05	Yoshi2	http://www.qupie.co.uk/news.xml "This application is a 3d Model editor for division BGF models. BGF is the Binary Geometry File format. [...]"
2016-07-04 21:27:27	Yoshi2	http://www.agocg.ac.uk/train/rendeval/formats/vdi.htm "BGF and VDI are formats used by VR software from Division . BGF is the Binary Geometry File format."
2016-07-04 21:28:41	Yoshi2	"used by VR software from Division"
2016-07-04 21:28:53	Yoshi2	it doesn't even talk about what software there is
2016-07-04 21:28:57	Yoshi2	just hat it exists
2016-07-04 21:29:07	@Espyo	wow
2016-07-04 21:29:10	@Espyo	at least it exists
2016-07-04 21:29:16	@Espyo	and the name kinda hints at what's up
2016-07-04 21:29:51	Yoshi2	for the moment, I fear in the best case it only hints at what software they used to make the models
2016-07-04 21:30:02	Yoshi2	and nothing about the final format used in the game
2016-07-04 21:30:33	@Espyo	well, it does let you know that whatever format they used uses some sort of binary tree organization
2016-07-04 21:30:42	@Espyo	so if you want to reverse-engineer the format...
2016-07-04 21:32:09	Yoshi2	how do you know about the binary tree organization?
2016-07-04 21:32:26	@Espyo	some classes in university that are all forgotten
2016-07-04 21:32:40	@Espyo	unless you mean how I know that the format uses binary tree organization
2016-07-04 21:32:42	@Espyo	well, it's in the name :V
2016-07-04 21:33:00	Yoshi2	how do you go from binary geometry to binary tree
2016-07-04 21:33:20	@Espyo	does "binary geometry" mean something else?
2016-07-04 21:33:34	@Espyo	I figured it was just referring to how the polygons are sorted in the format
2016-07-04 21:34:07	Yoshi2	it's probably more like binary|geometry file
2016-07-04 21:34:11	Yoshi2	which could mean ANYTHING
2016-07-04 21:34:19	@Espyo	guess so
2016-07-04 21:34:28	@Espyo	but calling a non-text file "binary" is redundant
2016-07-04 21:34:33	@Espyo	so I don't really see why they would do it
2016-07-04 21:34:39	@Espyo	unless it's related to BST
2016-07-04 21:38:03	Yoshi2	assuming this format is what they used, I'm probably not going to find docs on what it is
2016-07-04 21:38:21	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-07-04 21:41:40	Yoshi2	i am not looking forward to reverse-engineering this
2016-07-04 21:41:50	Yoshi2	i am NOT looking forward to reverse-engineering this
2016-07-04 21:50:39	@Espyo	I bet
2016-07-04 21:51:00	Yoshi2	the most I can do is switch out data sections and hope that it still works
2016-07-04 21:51:25	Yoshi2	when I have narrowed down what each section does, I can try to modify it
2016-07-04 21:51:37	Yoshi2	and at some point maybe render the model

2016-07-05 19:46:17	Yoshi2	mathematical logic: model theory, whoooooooho
2016-07-05 19:48:32	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-07-05 19:50:43	Yoshi2	the worst part of this is
2016-07-05 19:50:56	Yoshi2	the stuff is so easy that if you have ONE pointer
2016-07-05 19:50:59	Yoshi2	you know what to do
2016-07-05 19:51:25	@Espyo	how so?
2016-07-05 19:51:54	Yoshi2	if there is a task and you need to prove it, the pointer would be the method you use to prove it
2016-07-05 19:52:13	Yoshi2	or if the question is whether it is X, Y or Z and why, once you have the first part the workload bcomes easier

2016-07-05 19:56:41	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-07-05 19:56:53	@Espyo	but what if the pointer is wrong?
2016-07-05 19:56:57	@Espyo	does more harm than good

2016-07-05 21:58:07	Yoshi2	how is the health progress
2016-07-05 21:59:35	Marty1401	I thought I'd be back on Friday, but this might take longer. Otherwise... I spend my time watching TV or sleeping
2016-07-05 22:00:35	Marty1401	Anyway... I haven't forgotten about BW, I will download an iso when I'm back ;)
2016-07-05 22:00:49	Yoshi2	heh
2016-07-05 22:00:57	Yoshi2	what is keeping you in bed?
2016-07-05 22:01:14	Marty1401	Tired
2016-07-05 22:01:47	Marty1401	How to say...

2016-07-05 22:02:42	Marty1401	And see, this is quite tiring, I have difficulties connecting to Pikipedia too
2016-07-05 22:02:47	Marty1401	Yes
2016-07-05 22:03:42	Yoshi2	I was more talking about what happened that you have to stay in a hospital now
2016-07-05 22:05:33	Marty1401	Ah... well, it's quite complicated to explain everything, I will do it, no worries... but maybe not all today. I'll send you Wikipedia links (since I don't know the English names for what I have). You know, it's not my first time
2016-07-05 22:06:31	Yoshi2	I see
2016-07-05 22:07:09	Yoshi2	doesn't have to be in-depth, wikipedia links will be fine
2016-07-05 22:08:38	Marty1401	Sure, check your PMs

2016-07-06 20:33:32	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-07-06 20:33:32	Testyo	so you're using a little time to show up, and to start filtering actions
2016-07-06 20:33:38	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-06 20:36:24	Yoshi2	I have an idea for a BW video, but I've been holding off on it because I want to make it into a commentary about terrain stuff
2016-07-06 20:36:52	Yoshi2	which means choosing between lower framerates and live commentary, or perfect framerates and I record my talk later
2016-07-06 20:40:54	@Espyo	yikes
2016-07-06 20:40:56	@Espyo	that really is a tough call
2016-07-06 20:41:07	@Espyo	well, I think good framerate and later recording works better in general
2016-07-06 20:41:15	@Espyo	it'll be hard to time it during gameplay, sure
2016-07-06 20:41:27	@Espyo	but hey, you can still speed yourself up or slow yourself down on post-production
2016-07-06 20:41:33	@Espyo	you have infinite retries at doing the commentary
2016-07-06 20:41:39	@Espyo	plus the framerate being smooth is also good to look at
2016-07-06 20:41:44	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-07-06 20:41:46	@Espyo	if not, it gives the idea that you're some amateur
2016-07-06 20:41:53	Yoshi2	it will just be REALLY
2016-07-06 20:41:55	Yoshi2	REALLY
2016-07-06 20:42:09	Yoshi2	tough to time for how long I will show something before moving on
2016-07-06 20:42:38	Yoshi2	what feels like 5 seconds will be 1 second in the final video
2016-07-06 20:43:55	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2016-07-06 20:47:12	Yoshi2	and another problem that keeps me from making the video http://i.imgur.com/Qs59nwF.png
2016-07-06 20:47:48	@Espyo	click on the uninstall button
2016-07-06 20:47:57	@Espyo	it's a debugging feature made by Valve that helps with video-making problems
2016-07-06 20:48:25	Yoshi2	i hope i don't misclick
2016-07-06 20:52:23	Yoshi2	right below is one of the next games in the series lined up

2016-07-06 23:50:33	En_Passant	I'm considering adding a bot to my wiki
2016-07-06 23:50:53	En_Passant	I'm currently the only editor, but I want to be prepared in case it grows
2016-07-06 23:50:56	En_Passant	Thoughts?
2016-07-07 00:05:42	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-07 00:05:47	@Espyo	well, depends on the bot you want
2016-07-07 00:05:53	@Espyo	but for instance, we never needed a bot for Pikipedia
2016-07-07 00:05:58	@Espyo	well, we did, to transfer the wikia pages over
2016-07-07 00:06:04	@Espyo	but if that didn't happen, we wouldn't
2016-07-07 00:06:16	@Espyo	I think we did use a bot to do some massive automatic task at one point
2016-07-07 00:06:17	@Espyo	but *shrug*
2016-07-07 00:06:21	@Espyo	anyway, I have to go to bed

2016-07-08 18:44:21	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2016-07-08 18:49:18	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-07-08 18:49:18	Testyo	hm, fire wasn't in their path at all
2016-07-08 18:50:54	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-08 18:53:32	Yoshi2	spent some time today setting up OBS on linux
2016-07-08 18:56:14	@Espyo	ooh
2016-07-08 18:56:15	@Espyo	any luck?
2016-07-08 18:56:52	Yoshi2	the framerate dips to 15-20 sometimes, but 30 is full speed so I think it isn't too bad
2016-07-08 18:59:07	Yoshi2	and it stays at 30 often enough
2016-07-08 18:59:35	@Espyo	right
2016-07-08 19:00:07	Yoshi2	I'll do a test run now
2016-07-08 19:39:15	Yoshi2	phew

2016-07-08 20:40:46	Marty1401	Hi Espyo
2016-07-08 20:42:35	@Espyo	I was thinking today
2016-07-08 20:42:40	@Espyo	we should try our hand at the sizing project again some day
2016-07-08 20:42:44	@Espyo	dunno if you saw it
2016-07-08 20:42:54	@Espyo	I made some attempts some years back, you probably weren't around
2016-07-08 20:43:02	Marty1401	Hmm... I'm not sure to recall
2016-07-08 20:43:18	Marty1401	Oh, I cannot remember, I wasn't here :p

2016-07-08 20:44:49	@Espyo	I really want to see this happen one day
2016-07-08 20:44:52	@Espyo	but there are a lot of problems
2016-07-08 20:45:16	Marty1401	That's a cool project
2016-07-08 20:45:18	Marty1401	Ah?
2016-07-08 20:45:36	@Espyo	#1, getting a model, posing it, aligning it with Olimar, Pikimin, and/or an average human, taking the image, and editing it to become a silhouette
2016-07-08 20:45:40	@Espyo	are all pretty hard as they are
2016-07-08 20:45:54	@Espyo	but on top of that, apparently Pikmin 2 stores its models with non-standard sizes
2016-07-08 20:45:59	Marty1401	Yeah
2016-07-08 20:46:05	Marty1401	Heh
2016-07-08 20:46:10	@Espyo	like, if I export the model of a Red Bulborb and the model of a, say, Water Dumple, they could be the wrong size in relation to one another
2016-07-08 20:46:16	Marty1401	That's Pikmin 2, after all
2016-07-08 20:46:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-08 20:46:22	@Espyo	hardly surprising, isn't it? :P
2016-07-08 20:46:27	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 COULD make it easier
2016-07-08 20:46:29	@Espyo	but not by much
2016-07-08 20:46:38	@Espyo	it's such an ambitious project, and with no good way to automate it
2016-07-08 20:46:44	Marty1401	I see
2016-07-08 20:53:48	UltraMario	hi marty
2016-07-08 20:53:53	UltraMario	been getting better?

2016-07-08 20:54:49	Marty1401	Same, I miss Pikipedia too :/
2016-07-08 20:55:04	UltraMario	are you getting any better at least? :(
2016-07-08 20:55:15	Marty1401	A little
2016-07-08 20:55:27	UltraMario	well, thats good at least
2016-07-08 20:55:32	UltraMario	keep on keeping on <3
2016-07-08 20:55:40	UltraMario	i know how it feels
2016-07-08 20:55:51	UltraMario	first time i was in the hospital it was horrible, so
2016-07-08 20:56:11	UltraMario	you gotta be resilient and stick things out
2016-07-08 20:56:17	@Espyo	exactly
2016-07-08 20:56:23	Marty1401	But it's not my first time... :p I see
2016-07-08 20:56:26	Marty1401	Yeah
2016-07-08 20:56:30	UltraMario	regardless :p
2016-07-08 20:56:37	UltraMario	it's a good thing i brought my 3ds my first time
2016-07-08 20:56:49	Marty1401	I have my 3DS
2016-07-08 20:56:50	UltraMario	i hung out in the marioboards to tell everyone how i was
2016-07-08 20:57:02	UltraMario	the 2nd hospital visit i also had it
2016-07-08 20:57:20	UltraMario	but on the most recent one, i had my phone. that was about 2 months ago
2016-07-08 20:57:34	Marty1401	I see
2016-07-08 20:57:53	UltraMario	i had appendicitis and a blockage the first time
2016-07-08 20:57:56	UltraMario	so it was double trouble
2016-07-08 20:57:56	UltraMario	:(
2016-07-08 20:58:10	Marty1401	Heh :/
2016-07-08 20:58:47	UltraMario	it was bad enough my nurse was a douche

2016-07-08 21:47:43	Yoshi2	only downside is that the English VA didn't voice everything

2016-07-08 22:36:32	@PikFan	what was this Pikmin 3 livestream meetup?
2016-07-08 22:36:55	@PikFan	I read the forum posts about it but I forgot about them lol
2016-07-08 22:37:24	@Espyo	right, so
2016-07-08 22:37:40	@Espyo	some of the "wikia" Pikipedia guys met up IRL
2016-07-08 22:37:42	@Espyo	in Texas, I think?
2016-07-08 22:37:51	@Espyo	and I think it was five of them that met up
2016-07-08 22:37:57	@Espyo	so they had a little hang around, did some tourneys, etc.
2016-07-08 22:38:07	@PikFan	nice
2016-07-08 22:38:15	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-08 22:38:37	@PikFan	I wonder why they chose July 4th to do it, though
2016-07-08 22:38:53	@Espyo	they were there from, more or less, 2nd of July to 8th
2016-07-08 22:38:56	@Espyo	or something like that
2016-07-08 22:39:02	@Espyo	dunno why 4th, yeah, but *shrug*
2016-07-08 22:39:03	@PikFan	mhm, yes
2016-07-08 22:39:52	@PikFan	I thought it was funny because, you know, our American users most likely wouldn't be watching, what with the celebrations and all
2016-07-08 22:39:56	@PikFan	but eh
2016-07-08 22:40:08	@Espyo	yeah, I told them that

2016-07-08 22:43:05	@Espyo	heh, nice
2016-07-08 22:43:24	@PikFan	went and explored the town where my mom went to university
2016-07-08 22:43:28	@PikFan	made some friends
2016-07-08 22:43:36	@PikFan	oh, but the drivers there are insane

2016-07-08 22:44:35	@Espyo	...is it?
2016-07-08 22:45:02	@PikFan	the day I left, there was a car wreck out on the road
2016-07-08 22:45:12	@PikFan	and my aunt said that a lot of drivers die on the road
2016-07-08 22:45:53	@Espyo	that's insane
2016-07-08 22:45:57	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-07-08 22:46:21	@PikFan	the main roads have 3 lanes on either side

2016-07-08 22:46:46	@PikFan	and then the freeways have 5 to 7 lanes on either side
2016-07-08 22:47:38	@PikFan	but yeah, despite the awful traffic, it was pretty nice
2016-07-08 22:47:43	@PikFan	the mountains there are huge
2016-07-08 22:47:49	@PikFan	they just loom over the city

2016-07-08 22:50:00	@PikFan	there's a fairly large reservoir and open fields, and all this is in a valley with the mountains all around 
2016-07-08 22:50:34	@PikFan	oh, and the climate is better, too
2016-07-08 22:50:45	@PikFan	it's dryer than where I live, so that's a plus

2016-07-08 22:55:25	@PikFan	oh, I forgot
2016-07-08 22:55:36	@PikFan	there's actually a smaller town in that valley
2016-07-08 22:55:44	@PikFan	about 10,000 people live in it or so
2016-07-08 22:56:01	Yoshi2|offline	death seems like a better alternative to no internet

2016-07-08 22:56:12	@Espyo	car crash sounds better
2016-07-08 22:56:33	@PikFan	speaking of internet, that reminds me
2016-07-08 22:56:54	@PikFan	I tried connecting my Wii U to my hotel's internet, which was a pain in the butt
2016-07-08 22:57:11	@Espyo	phoo, I bet
2016-07-08 22:57:14	@PikFan	because it kept saying something about the proxy server settings not being correct
2016-07-08 22:58:05	@Espyo	yeah, the hotel's wifi is probably under some proxy
2016-07-08 22:58:15	@PikFan	but then I saw some gamefaqs thread about this issue and someone said to just open the internet browser
2016-07-08 22:58:18	@PikFan	which I did
2016-07-08 22:58:20	@PikFan	and... it worked
2016-07-08 22:58:32	@PikFan	I was amazed but also angry

2016-07-08 23:05:34	@PikFan	hm, I see
2016-07-08 23:20:58	@PikFan	so, how about that final Splatfest?
2016-07-08 23:21:10	@PikFan	how do you feel about it?

2016-07-08 23:22:09	@PikFan	I agree
2016-07-08 23:22:27	@Espyo	and the entire fight is a shitstorm, but I bet they have something under their sleeve
2016-07-08 23:22:38	@Espyo	it can't just be a bitter "winner takes all" waifufest
2016-07-08 23:22:49	@Espyo	I bet a pretty penny that by the end, they'll make up

2016-07-08 23:28:42	@Espyo	<Espyo> mhm, dunno what got into them
2016-07-08 23:28:43	@Espyo	just this
2016-07-08 23:28:49	@PikFan	alright
2016-07-08 23:28:51	@Espyo	I was gonna say, though
2016-07-08 23:29:01	@Espyo	they probably made it super hard to add a new Splatfest
2016-07-08 23:29:06	@Espyo	because they're so disorganized
2016-07-08 23:29:13	@Espyo	just deciding a Splatfest is death for them
2016-07-08 23:29:19	@Espyo	when it's easy for, you know, any other human
2016-07-08 23:29:25	@Espyo	*coughNorthPoleSouthPolecough*
2016-07-08 23:29:33	@Espyo	and then setting up the servers to do it...
2016-07-08 23:29:35	@PikFan	so much for listening to the fans
2016-07-08 23:29:44	@Espyo	any competent company could probably flip a switch and add a new Splatfest in a heartbeat
2016-07-08 23:29:59	@PikFan	yeah
2016-07-08 23:29:59	@Espyo	but Nintendo have to turn on all the red alarms and restructure everything just to get one Splatfest rolling
2016-07-08 23:30:05	@Espyo	that's probably why they quit
2016-07-08 23:30:08	@Espyo	they're so bad with online stuff...
2016-07-08 23:30:13	@PikFan	^^^^^^^^
2016-07-08 23:30:22	@Espyo	it's insane
2016-07-08 23:30:31	@PikFan	I can't understand why they refuse to get better
2016-07-08 23:30:44	@Espyo	because they're always too proud to admit they're wrong
2016-07-08 23:30:46	@PikFan	why do they have to drag themselves into the mud
2016-07-08 23:30:51	@Espyo	or that they need help
2016-07-08 23:30:59	@Espyo	if they got in their heads that they can give this online thing a go
2016-07-08 23:31:03	@PikFan	well, that pride will be the end of them
2016-07-08 23:31:03	@Espyo	nothing will change their minds
2016-07-08 23:31:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-08 23:31:24	@PikFan	if Nintendo continues to refuse to get with the times...
2016-07-08 23:31:28	@PikFan	then they're done for
2016-07-08 23:31:35	@PikFan	if the NX doesn't do good...
2016-07-08 23:31:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-08 23:31:44	@PikFan	it HAS to do good
2016-07-08 23:32:02	@PikFan	if it doesn't, nobody will take Nintendo seriously
2016-07-08 23:32:07	@PikFan	I mean, hardly anyone does
2016-07-08 23:32:18	@PikFan	but if the NX doesn't do good, then that's it
2016-07-08 23:32:43	@PikFan	people say that Nintendo will just let their IPs go onto other platforms
2016-07-08 23:32:51	@PikFan	but you know what I think?
2016-07-08 23:33:07	@PikFan	I think that Nintendo will be stubborn as always, and refuse to give away rights to their IPs
2016-07-08 23:33:11	@PikFan	and...
2016-07-08 23:33:18	@PikFan	no more Nintendo games will be made...
2016-07-08 23:33:45	@PikFan	that would be beyond heartbreaking
2016-07-08 23:34:00	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-07-08 23:34:03	@Espyo	though, we can wait 60 years
2016-07-08 23:34:09	@Espyo	when the copyrights presumably expire
2016-07-08 23:34:17	@Espyo	and Mario, Zelda, etc. becomes public domain
2016-07-08 23:34:33	@PikFan	copyrights can expire?
2016-07-08 23:34:34	@PikFan	huh
2016-07-08 23:34:42	@Espyo	mhm
2016-07-08 23:34:50	@Espyo	though it looks like some recent...ish thing made them take a LOT longer to expire
2016-07-08 23:35:05	@PikFan	well, the technology in 60 years will probably be so good that anyone can make a game really easily
2016-07-08 23:35:13	@Espyo	maybe
2016-07-08 23:35:28	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-07-08 23:35:36	@PikFan	I'm just really disappointed in Nintendo
2016-07-08 23:35:42	@PikFan	so many bad choices, all over the place
2016-07-08 23:36:05	@PikFan	so much disorganization
2016-07-08 23:36:12	@PikFan	so little competence
2016-07-08 23:36:40	@PikFan	just give us a good online infrastructure, dammit!
2016-07-08 23:36:51	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-08 23:36:52	@PikFan	we want games, but also COMPETENCE!
2016-07-08 23:37:11	@PikFan	we want a reliable company to create reliable hardware
2016-07-08 23:37:21	@PikFan	why is it so hard?
2016-07-08 23:37:23	@PikFan	why?
2016-07-08 23:37:39	@PikFan	it's no wonder the PS4 is doing so great
2016-07-08 23:37:46	@PikFan	comparatively, anyway
2016-07-08 23:38:07	@PikFan	PS4 is a pretty solid piece of hardware, and it has good online infrastructure
2016-07-08 23:38:16	@PikFan	I mean, it can record up to 15 minutes of gameplay
2016-07-08 23:38:20	@PikFan	that's amazing
2016-07-08 23:39:01	@PikFan	it might not necessarily be about the specs, but it's definitely about the infrastructure
2016-07-08 23:39:13	@PikFan	if there's nothing to base their online systems on...
2016-07-08 23:39:38	@Espyo	you're talking about Nintendo falling under
2016-07-08 23:39:46	@Espyo	Gaming98 and Thomas on Discord are too
2016-07-08 23:39:50	@PikFan	hahah
2016-07-08 23:39:54	@Espyo	I'm surrounded by negativity :/
2016-07-08 23:39:59	@Espyo	I'm just trying to make a Dweevil :(
2016-07-08 23:40:07	@Espyo	I mean, it's all true
2016-07-08 23:40:17	@Espyo	but it's everywhere I turn :V
2016-07-08 23:40:30	@PikFan	such is the way of gaming communities
2016-07-08 23:40:37	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-08 23:40:42	@PikFan	well
2016-07-08 23:40:49	@PikFan	at least Nintendo continues to make good games
2016-07-08 23:40:52	@PikFan	...right?
2016-07-08 23:40:56	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-08 23:41:01	@Espyo	they're just acting dumb, sometimes
2016-07-08 23:41:08	@PikFan	the new Zelda looks phenomenal
2016-07-08 23:41:15	@Espyo	definitely

2016-07-08 23:41:26	@PikFan	I really think that it will be the OoT of our generation
2016-07-08 23:41:42	@PikFan	I mean, the open-world genre has already been established
2016-07-08 23:41:54	@PikFan	but bringing Zelda into this is quite the upset
2016-07-08 23:42:01	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-08 23:42:25	@PikFan	heh, I heard that someone tried to steal the E3 demo
2016-07-08 23:42:31	@PikFan	...they failed, of course
2016-07-08 23:42:39	@PikFan	but it was an interesting read
2016-07-08 23:43:09	@PikFan	I would be so excited if they released a demo on the E3
2016-07-08 23:43:15	@PikFan	*e-shop
2016-07-08 23:43:17	@PikFan	...wow
2016-07-08 23:43:32	@Espyo	hah, yeah
2016-07-08 23:43:35	@PikFan	I would pay money to play it

2016-07-09 11:40:01	Yoshi2	I should make a placeholder article for battalion wars

2016-07-09 11:45:58	@Espyo	you should
2016-07-09 11:47:13	Yoshi2	Espyo: what was that website you suggested for release dates of games?
2016-07-09 11:48:15	@Espyo	mobygames, I think
2016-07-09 11:48:29	@Espyo	and according to my bookmarks...
2016-07-09 11:48:30	@Espyo	http://homepage2.nifty.com/gamedatabase/index.html this too
2016-07-09 11:51:50	Yoshi2	i'll take mobygames
2016-07-09 11:51:58	Yoshi2	can't navigate that Japanese page at all

2016-07-09 13:18:51	Marty1401	Hello!
2016-07-09 13:19:03	Yoshi2	hey marty
2016-07-09 13:19:08	@Espyo	ok, so I thought a bit more about the size chart project
2016-07-09 13:19:11	@Espyo	and it might actually be easy
2016-07-09 13:19:18	@Espyo	aligning the models of a person, Olimar, and the enemy might be hard
2016-07-09 13:19:23	@Espyo	but I realized I don't HAVE to do that
2016-07-09 13:19:29	Marty1401	Oh
2016-07-09 13:19:47	@Espyo	I can keep an image of an Olimar silhouette, a human silhouette, and then just make an enemy silhouette one by one
2016-07-09 13:20:01	@Espyo	and then I can probably build some program to automatically align the images, add a ruler, etc.
2016-07-09 13:20:03	Marty1401	I see
2016-07-09 13:20:20	@Espyo	so, I'm hyped about it again
2016-07-09 13:20:28	@Espyo	there's still the problem of Pikmin 2's models being off-scale
2016-07-09 13:20:31	@Espyo	but I'll investigate it better
2016-07-09 13:20:38	Marty1401	That'd be nice, wow! 
2016-07-09 13:20:38	@Espyo	plus, Pikmin 3 models are also a thing, so I can use those
2016-07-09 13:20:42	@Espyo	and afaik, those aren't off-scale
2016-07-09 13:21:03	@Espyo	also, you came just when I finished my weekly Miiverse weirdness round
2016-07-09 13:21:09	Marty1401	Okay
2016-07-09 13:21:18	@Espyo	and this user has a LOT of glitch posts https://miiverse.nintendo.net/users/pikmin3isgood
2016-07-09 13:21:23	Marty1401	Oh :/ No problem
2016-07-09 13:21:29	Marty1401	I'll check out
2016-07-09 13:21:36	@Espyo	almost looks like he's able to throw leaders and Pikmin anywhere at will
2016-07-09 13:21:37	@Espyo	it's weird
2016-07-09 13:23:31	Marty1401	I know them, but it's cool. Might record a video on al OoB when I get back
2016-07-09 13:24:21	@Espyo	oh

2016-07-09 13:24:51	@Espyo	neat
2016-07-09 13:25:04	@Espyo	speaking of run, there was a SGDQ run of Pikmin
2016-07-09 13:25:10	@Espyo	but it was in the early morning for us

2016-07-09 17:27:19	@Espyo	if posted in the OP, why's he complaining that his own image sucks?

2016-07-09 18:21:46	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-09 18:21:46	Scruffy	Only here for a few minutes
2016-07-09 18:21:55	@Espyo	how are things?
2016-07-09 18:22:17	Scruffy	We just had our composition concert
2016-07-09 18:22:20	Scruffy	It went so well
2016-07-09 18:22:37	Yoshi2	neat, when are you coming back?
2016-07-09 18:22:37	Scruffy	The performers were excellent, I'm very proud of them and the piece sounded its best
2016-07-09 18:22:50	Scruffy	Tomorrow, it'll take me all day
2016-07-09 18:23:25	@Espyo	that's so great!
2016-07-09 18:23:34	@Espyo	were you able to get permission to share?
2016-07-09 18:23:39	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-09 18:23:44	@Espyo	oh, sweet
2016-07-09 18:23:46	Scruffy	But it'll take a while to get the recording
2016-07-09 18:23:54	@Espyo	worth the wait
2016-07-09 18:24:00	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-09 18:25:14	Scruffy	Anyway, I've gotta run because the singing students are putting together their final project, several scenes from an opera, and all the composers are attending

2016-07-09 19:10:55	En_Passant	The runner's not very good, though
2016-07-09 19:17:40	@Espyo	yeah, I missed it

2016-07-09 19:27:15	En_Passant	Actually, it's a trans female
2016-07-09 19:28:48	@Espyo	ok, in that case, aren't they?
2016-07-09 19:29:47	En_Passant	Isn't she what?
2016-07-09 19:29:50	@Espyo	good
2016-07-09 19:30:55	En_Passant	Not really. The German guy on the couch is better from what I've seen
2016-07-09 19:31:07	@Espyo	kinda weird
2016-07-09 19:31:15	@Espyo	any obvious thing?
2016-07-09 19:31:23	@Espyo	like not knowing the game, or making a lot of mistakes?
2016-07-09 19:32:15	En_Passant	Um... not especially. Just slow, her runs are typically 9 or 10 days

2016-07-09 23:07:17	@PikFan	why does he add one tiny thing per edit
2016-07-09 23:07:24	@PikFan	I don't understand that

2016-07-10 00:23:30	Scruffy	At least I have interesting stuff to do
2016-07-10 00:23:30	@PikFan	how was your trip?
2016-07-10 00:23:38	Scruffy	Fantastic
2016-07-10 00:24:03	Scruffy	Our pieces went really well, and the weather, food, culture – everything was amazing
2016-07-10 00:24:59	@PikFan	awesome
2016-07-10 00:25:03	Scruffy	I ought to have a recording soon, and I'm going to set up a SoundCloud account to share my music
2016-07-10 00:25:28	@PikFan	sounds great, I bet you've got some great pieces
2016-07-10 00:25:39	Scruffy	Heh, thank you
2016-07-10 00:25:55	Scruffy	For now I'm just winding down before my flight though
2016-07-10 00:26:07	@PikFan	how long is the flight?
2016-07-10 00:26:23	Scruffy	It's three flights, combined 11 hours of flying
2016-07-10 00:26:34	Scruffy	But it won't be that bad, I've done it before
2016-07-10 00:27:02	@PikFan	I was in the car for 13 hours 2 days ago, coming back from Utah
2016-07-10 00:27:13	Scruffy	Woah
2016-07-10 00:27:17	Scruffy	How was Utah?
2016-07-10 00:27:20	@PikFan	and... it went faster than I thought
2016-07-10 00:27:24	@PikFan	fantastic
2016-07-10 00:27:44	@PikFan	loved the scenery and the weather
2016-07-10 00:27:54	@PikFan	also met some family on my dad's side
2016-07-10 00:28:08	@PikFan	I never met my father, nor his family
2016-07-10 00:28:42	Scruffy	Awesome! Congratulations on getting to meet them!
2016-07-10 00:28:50	@PikFan	thanks
2016-07-10 00:29:21	@PikFan	the traffic was awful, though; nearly got T-boned on the second day there
2016-07-10 00:29:36	Scruffy	ouch
2016-07-10 00:29:38	@PikFan	and the day we left, we saw a wreck out on the road
2016-07-10 00:29:50	Scruffy	Yeah, drivers are pretty reckless here in Greece too
2016-07-10 00:29:54	@PikFan	fun
2016-07-10 00:30:36	@PikFan	but yeah, despite the stressful driving, it was a pretty great trip
2016-07-10 00:30:48	Scruffy	Cool, I'm glad to hear it'
2016-07-10 00:30:52	@PikFan	same for you
2016-07-10 00:30:56	Scruffy	I'm excited to come back to the States
2016-07-10 00:31:04	Scruffy	and relax for the rest of the summer
2016-07-10 00:31:08	@PikFan	right
2016-07-10 00:32:31	@PikFan	I only missed my bed
2016-07-10 00:32:40	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-10 00:32:55	@PikFan	I'm a very hot sleeper
2016-07-10 00:33:46	Scruffy	yeah
2016-07-10 00:34:09	Scruffy	I would be sleeping right now, but I'm trying to be preemptive against jetlag
2016-07-10 00:34:22	@PikFan	good strategy
2016-07-10 00:34:36	Scruffy	Plus in Greek culture dinner usually doesn't start until 10:00 or 11:00, so I've been out pretty late with the other composers
2016-07-10 00:34:52	@PikFan	that's pretty late
2016-07-10 00:35:07	Scruffy	The food is worth it though
2016-07-10 00:35:32	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-07-10 00:36:10	Scruffy	I'm going to miss Greek-made feta cheese
2016-07-10 00:36:36	Scruffy	It's such a good versatile cheese flavor
2016-07-10 00:36:45	@PikFan	hmm
2016-07-10 00:37:21	@PikFan	I'm such a picky eater, I probably wouldn't survive in a foreign country
2016-07-10 00:37:51	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-10 00:38:11	@PikFan	but... I've been a little better about trying things lately
2016-07-10 00:38:16	@PikFan	so maybe I'd be fine
2016-07-10 00:38:36	Scruffy	Greece's food definitely has you coming back for more
2016-07-10 00:38:44	Scruffy	It's nice and light
2016-07-10 00:39:10	@PikFan	so is it like grain and dairy products, then?
2016-07-10 00:39:29	Scruffy	Yes, a lot
2016-07-10 00:39:35	Scruffy	But also a lot of vegetables
2016-07-10 00:39:44	@PikFan	I see
2016-07-10 00:39:47	Scruffy	They have a vast variety of salads\
2016-07-10 00:39:59	Scruffy	And grilled mushrooms, which are really great
2016-07-10 00:40:21	@PikFan	definitely not a mushroom fan
2016-07-10 00:40:44	@PikFan	the thought of eating a mushroom kinda freaks me out
2016-07-10 00:40:52	@PikFan	but that's how I feel :P
2016-07-10 00:40:58	Scruffy	Heh, no problem
2016-07-10 00:41:55	Scruffy	Yeah, I guess the general flavors here are pretty... earthy
2016-07-10 00:41:58	Scruffy	and herby
2016-07-10 00:43:23	@PikFan	hehe
2016-07-10 00:45:45	Scruffy	Anyway
2016-07-10 00:45:56	Scruffy	Right now I'm populating the Daybreak Glade to pass the time
2016-07-10 00:46:02	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-07-10 00:46:03	Scruffy	Placing metal and enemies
2016-07-10 00:46:09	@PikFan	I saw that map that you made
2016-07-10 00:46:19	@PikFan	it's certainly updated
2016-07-10 00:46:25	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-10 00:46:45	Scruffy	I thought I might give digital painting a try
2016-07-10 00:46:49	Scruffy	Over this trip
2016-07-10 00:47:01	@PikFan	wait, do you still have the original sketch?
2016-07-10 00:47:04	Scruffy	yes
2016-07-10 00:47:32	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Glade_of_Daylight_Concept.png
2016-07-10 00:47:54	Scruffy	It's still based on the four areas from Pikmin 2
2016-07-10 00:47:58	@PikFan	awesome
2016-07-10 00:48:08	@PikFan	right, I was looking for the areas in there before
2016-07-10 00:48:23	Scruffy	But after painting the base layer I changed quite a bit about the terrain
2016-07-10 00:48:29	Scruffy	Particularly in adding tree roots
2016-07-10 00:48:43	Scruffy	And then I painted the shadows and finally the water
2016-07-10 00:49:42	@PikFan	what program did you make this in? it looks really nice
2016-07-10 00:49:54	Scruffy	SketchBook
2016-07-10 00:50:00	Scruffy	The one with the pencil icon
2016-07-10 00:50:09	@PikFan	oh, that
2016-07-10 00:50:22	Scruffy	Except it's the free version, with a lot of limitations because they don't want you to stay on the free version forever
2016-07-10 00:50:22	@PikFan	I've used it before, but I could never create anything decent
2016-07-10 00:50:40	@PikFan	probably because I didn't try hard enough :P
2016-07-10 00:50:49	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-10 00:51:08	Scruffy	It's not that bad if you sketch what you want in plain pencil first
2016-07-10 00:51:23	Scruffy	I painted over this sketch, which made it a lot easier to define shapes
2016-07-10 00:51:48	Scruffy	But painting is still kind of tedious since it simulates how a brush really runs out of paint during a stroke
2016-07-10 00:52:20	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-07-10 00:54:02	Scruffy	But I think that's how I'll do all my PF maps
2016-07-10 00:54:40	Scruffy	Although I have no idea how they'll look, other than the Scalding Thicket vaguely having a lake at the south
2016-07-10 00:56:38	@PikFan	hm
2016-07-10 00:56:49	@PikFan	since you're using all of P2's areas in just 1 map...
2016-07-10 00:56:53	@PikFan	how will you do the others?
2016-07-10 00:57:30	Scruffy	Improvise, I guess
2016-07-10 00:57:38	Scruffy	Or at least draw inspiration from P3 maps
2016-07-10 00:57:51	@PikFan	I see
2016-07-10 01:01:47	Scruffy	Oh, I have to go for now, and get ready

2016-07-10 01:17:25	@PikFan	TV with HDMI?
2016-07-10 01:17:39	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-07-10 01:18:01	@PikFan	that makes me think HDTV, but that doesn't seem quite right
2016-07-10 01:18:22	@PikFan	or do you have an HDTV and you finally got an HDMI cable
2016-07-10 01:18:59	En_Passant	Wii Us come with HDMI cables lol
2016-07-10 01:19:08	@PikFan	...
2016-07-10 01:19:12	En_Passant	I just now got a TV that's new enough to have HDMI
2016-07-10 01:19:16	 *	@PikFan leaves ashamedly
2016-07-10 01:19:35	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-07-10 01:19:36	En_Passant	Before, I was using the old red, yellow, and white cable set to connect
2016-07-10 01:19:49	En_Passant	(the Wii uses those)
2016-07-10 01:20:03	@PikFan	why get an HDTV when you can get an UHDTV :P
2016-07-10 01:20:11	@PikFan	no, don't tell me: money
2016-07-10 01:20:33	@PikFan	anyway, nice
2016-07-10 01:21:01	En_Passant	the hell is a UHDTV
2016-07-10 01:21:02	@PikFan	you can now see Pikmin 3's graphics in their full glory :D
2016-07-10 01:21:32	@PikFan	like a 4K TV
2016-07-10 01:21:42	En_Passant	Oh, Ultra HD
2016-07-10 01:21:45	En_Passant	got it
2016-07-10 01:21:49	@PikFan	hehe, yeah
2016-07-10 01:22:23	@PikFan	and in another 5 years, they'll be obsolete, and we'll have 8K TVs :\
2016-07-10 01:22:43	En_Passant	I'm sure it'll be faster than that
2016-07-10 01:22:47	@PikFan	true
2016-07-10 01:22:58	@PikFan	but past 4K, it just seems pointless to me
2016-07-10 01:23:13	@PikFan	it seems more like a competition of who can get the most pixels into a screen
2016-07-10 01:23:38	En_Passant	What's funny is that the human eye can only see up to a certain resolution
2016-07-10 01:23:44	@PikFan	right
2016-07-10 01:23:51	@PikFan	that's why I say it's pointless
2016-07-10 01:24:04	En_Passant	I don't think we've hit it quite yet
2016-07-10 01:24:21	@PikFan	I think 4K is the limit
2016-07-10 01:24:31	@PikFan	but it could be higher
2016-07-10 01:25:26	@PikFan	oh, so on my old desktop, I tried running a YouTube video at UHD resolution
2016-07-10 01:25:32	@PikFan	my desktop crashed
2016-07-10 01:25:37	En_Passant	lmao
2016-07-10 01:25:54	@PikFan	I wasn't sure what it'd do, so I tried it
2016-07-10 01:30:29	En_Passant	tfw video on eye resolution shows xkcd map
2016-07-10 01:30:46	@PikFan	lol
2016-07-10 01:31:14	@PikFan	tfw when you found out that tfw means that feeling when
2016-07-10 01:32:02	En_Passant	lol
2016-07-10 01:33:02	@PikFan	yeah, for the longest time I saw tfw and I had no idea what it meant
2016-07-10 01:33:07	@PikFan	but I forgot to look it up
2016-07-10 02:18:47	En_Passant	gtg, dinner time

2016-07-10 19:50:51	@Espyo	Marty1401: somebody on #tcrf had one of the nectar grass patches on The Distant Spring spawn inside a wall
2016-07-10 19:50:57	@Espyo	you can see one or two blades peeking out
2016-07-10 19:51:00	@Espyo	and the Pikmin can't get it
2016-07-10 19:51:08	@Espyo	I asked for more info, and they gave me some screenshots
2016-07-10 19:51:11	@Espyo	though their game was hacked
2016-07-10 19:51:15	@Espyo	which had me suspicious
2016-07-10 19:51:19	@Espyo	I tried it myself, on the same spot
2016-07-10 19:51:26	@Espyo	but nothing; it's firm on the ground
2016-07-10 19:51:28	@Espyo	tried several days, too
2016-07-10 19:51:35	UltraMario	hi marty
2016-07-10 19:51:38	@Espyo	so, just a head's-up
2016-07-10 19:51:43	@Espyo	maybe one day we'll find if it's true or not
2016-07-10 19:51:52	@Espyo	they DID give me a save-state for Dolphin of it happening
2016-07-10 19:52:00	@Espyo	but it could, again, just be some code they used that broke it

2016-07-11 19:33:29	Yoshi2	Scruffy: I think with more info on pikmin's music format (bms), I could make a tool that helps with modifying it
2016-07-11 19:34:35	Scruffy	Oooh, cool
2016-07-11 19:34:44	Scruffy	I don't have any more info at the moment
2016-07-11 19:36:03	Yoshi2	I'd be suprised if you had more info considering you were away a lot lately :P
2016-07-11 19:36:09	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-11 19:36:22	Scruffy	Well I'm finished traveling for the year, I think
2016-07-11 19:37:33	Yoshi2	but your discovery of that one command having 3 or 5 bytes based on a value is pretty big, it invalidates quite a lot of info I figured out before that
2016-07-11 19:38:58	Scruffy	Yeah, I have no idea what those extra bytes would control
2016-07-11 19:39:47	Yoshi2	this early, it doesn't matter much what they do
2016-07-11 19:40:28	Yoshi2	but the fact that they exist means I interpreted some following data incorrectly

2016-07-11 19:41:46	Yoshi2	one idea I had for a helping tool is a bms viewer that is just a hex editor but it marks the different commands

2016-07-11 20:14:45	Yoshi2	no internet soon
2016-07-11 20:14:52	Yoshi2	something doesn't add up :I
2016-07-11 20:15:03	Marty1401	I hope to get back this week to do some Pikmin science soon

2016-07-11 20:17:06	Marty1401	Yoshi2: you spend it quickly, really. Espyo: Yeah
2016-07-11 20:17:33	Yoshi2	only if you are watching youtube every day
2016-07-11 20:17:55	@Espyo	you say that like it's weird
2016-07-11 20:18:08	Scruffy	Here's something interesting I just found out
2016-07-11 20:18:12	Yoshi2	Espyo: on a limited connection it is
2016-07-11 20:18:12	Marty1401	I have already spent 30MB in 10 minutes
2016-07-11 20:18:18	Scruffy	The "common" folder in "enemy"
2016-07-11 20:18:23	Marty1401	Oh
2016-07-11 20:18:24	@Espyo	guess so
2016-07-11 20:18:26	Marty1401	Oh?
2016-07-11 20:18:38	Scruffy	contains only one file called enemyCommon.szs
2016-07-11 20:18:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-11 20:18:57	Scruffy	With sekikaobj_large.bmd and sekikaobj_small.bmd
2016-07-11 20:18:57	@Espyo	and IIRC, it's just some rock model
2016-07-11 20:19:05	Scruffy	Those are the models for two rocks
2016-07-11 20:19:08	@Espyo	hm, never tried to translate the name
2016-07-11 20:19:16	@Espyo	but I'm guessing it's just some generic rock/dirt model used for particles
2016-07-11 20:19:18	Scruffy	That become particle systems whenever you petrify an enemy
2016-07-11 20:19:25	@Espyo	like Sheargrubs burying the dirt
2016-07-11 20:19:26	Scruffy	It's the rocks that coat the enemy
2016-07-11 20:19:29	@Espyo	oh!
2016-07-11 20:19:32	@Espyo	that makes sense
2016-07-11 20:19:43	Scruffy	The translation is roughly "Mineralization"
2016-07-11 20:19:54	@Espyo	ah
2016-07-11 20:20:17	Marty1401	Oh, cool
2016-07-11 20:20:18	@Espyo	done, I've updated the document we had
2016-07-11 20:20:20	@Espyo	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbyGA5actz2ra6scNUO_ebL88qz5Wx-89IKmwlmAS80/edit#gid=0
2016-07-11 20:20:40	Scruffy	So there are only two rocks that are used to construct the petrified enemies
2016-07-11 20:20:51	@Espyo	one small, one large, it seems
2016-07-11 20:20:58	@Espyo	I think all enemies have a file that specifies where the rocks go

2016-07-11 20:22:15	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-11 20:26:44	@J	yeah, I took a look at those ages ago
2016-07-11 20:27:12	@J	had fun trying to make diagrams from them
2016-07-11 20:27:42	@J	I don't think it's 'one small, one large', because the position files contain scale information
2016-07-11 20:27:59	@J	they're just different rocks for variety, or maybe one is higher-detail
2016-07-11 20:28:59	@Espyo	oh
2016-07-11 20:29:02	@Espyo	yeah, I remember you doing something
2016-07-11 20:29:07	@Espyo	but I thought you did hitboxes, not the rock positions
2016-07-11 20:29:13	@Espyo	I distinctly remember the egg
2016-07-11 20:29:20	@Espyo	either because it went super well, or super wrong
2016-07-11 20:29:43	@J	probably many wrong variants
2016-07-11 20:31:04	@J	maybe I did both, or maybe they're similar, too long ago
2016-07-11 20:32:00	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-07-11 20:32:10	@Espyo	 2010ish, if I had to guess
2016-07-11 20:32:20	@J	either way they're both just sets of positioned spheres
2016-07-11 20:32:31	@Espyo	right
2016-07-11 20:33:20	Yoshi2	I just noticed, my previous BMS project was for python 2 instead of python 3

2016-07-11 20:36:46	Yoshi2	well, I will cherry pick useful parts
2016-07-11 20:37:10	Yoshi2	while I'm at it, better take off my shirt because of how warm it is
2016-07-11 20:37:46	@Espyo	hardcore coding always requires taking off clothes
2016-07-11 20:38:06	Marty1401	Hah
2016-07-11 20:38:08	Yoshi2	if I didn't go outside today, I'd be sitting without pants, too
2016-07-11 20:38:26	@Espyo	I can deal with having clothes on at home
2016-07-11 20:38:29	@Espyo	but they HAVE to be loose clothes
2016-07-11 20:38:52	@Espyo	finding me with formal clothes at home is a myth
2016-07-11 20:39:12	Yoshi2	indeed

2016-07-11 20:46:43	Scruffy	I just heard it was available *after* getting back from Greece, so I haven't really caught anything yet and I'm sore that I wasn't able to catch any Greek Pokémon
2016-07-11 20:46:51	Scruffy	But it's pretty fun so far
2016-07-11 20:48:21	@Espyo	I haven't tried it, but a lot of my friends have
2016-07-11 20:48:24	@Espyo	feeling tempted
2016-07-11 20:48:28	@Espyo	but I'm not ready for the commitment :/
2016-07-11 20:48:33	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-11 20:48:35	@Espyo	plus Pokémon doesn't interest me that much
2016-07-11 20:48:42	@Espyo	I think Pokémon is awesome and all, but I'm not very interested
2016-07-11 20:48:49	@Espyo	I'm more interested in a different pkmn :V

2016-07-11 20:48:58	Scruffy	Same*
2016-07-11 20:49:29	Scruffy	Seems like this concept would kind of work for Pikmin
2016-07-11 20:49:36	Scruffy	You walk around and pluck Pikmin
2016-07-11 20:49:41	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-07-11 20:49:43	Scruffy	Then you find enemies and throw Pikmin at them
2016-07-11 20:49:51	Scruffy	And if you defeat them, you collect their Piklopedia page
2016-07-11 20:50:20	Scruffy	Pikmin is all about exploration, so that'd be pretty neat
2016-07-11 20:50:42	@Espyo	yeah, good point
2016-07-11 20:50:42	Scruffy	But there aren't hundreds of enemies to keep people occupied
2016-07-11 20:50:58	Scruffy	unlike in Pokemon
2016-07-11 20:51:02	@Espyo	time for Nintendo to take ideas from Pikmin Fanon

2016-07-12 18:59:31	Yoshi2	no editing possible at the moment because I am not sure how to enforce the formatting
2016-07-12 18:59:34	@Espyo	Yoshi2: oh, much better
2016-07-12 19:00:14	Yoshi2	Scruffy: do you remember what the thing was where we said that if a specific value was set, it is 5 bytes instead of 3?
2016-07-12 19:00:22	Yoshi2	I actually have trouble remembering what it was
2016-07-12 19:00:31	Yoshi2	and can't find it in my logs
2016-07-12 19:01:05	Scruffy	Hang on, I'll try to find the bms file where I found that...
2016-07-12 19:05:18	Scruffy	I feel like the value was whether or not a note was to have a modifier on it
2016-07-12 19:05:29	Scruffy	Such as sustain, pitch-shifting, or effects like htat
2016-07-12 19:05:32	Scruffy	that&
2016-07-12 19:05:36	Scruffy	that*
2016-07-12 19:07:11	Yoshi2	quite possible, but I'm missing examples
2016-07-12 19:08:47	Scruffy	Wait, never mind, I see now in new_02.bms, one of the effected notes is 3-byte
2016-07-12 19:09:14	Yoshi2	it was all a lie? :V
2016-07-12 19:09:29	Scruffy	There still appear to be 5-byte notes here

2016-07-12 19:12:26	Scruffy	Wait, actually look at offset 0x51C

2016-07-13 21:38:54	Scruffy	Hi everyone@
2016-07-13 21:49:48	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-13 21:50:07	@Espyo	so, I checked your SoundCloud
2016-07-13 21:50:11	@Espyo	great stuff
2016-07-13 21:50:18	@Espyo	Anchor gave me a great Psychonauts feeling
2016-07-13 21:50:47	@Espyo	I have to say though... I'm not a fan of The Wrath of Vulcan or Cosmic Kiss
2016-07-13 21:50:57	@Espyo	they seemed a bit too directionless
2016-07-13 21:51:17	@Espyo	the choir and instruments weren't in synch, and the songs didn't quite look like they led anywhere
2016-07-13 21:51:42	@Espyo	but then again, contemporary classical isn't my favorite type of music, by a long-shot, so take what I say with a grain of salt
2016-07-13 21:52:05	Scruffy	They aren't my favorites either, don't worry
2016-07-13 21:52:10	Scruffy	Especially Wrath of Vulcan
2016-07-13 21:52:17	@Espyo	for the same reasons?
2016-07-13 21:52:26	Yoshi2	Scruffy: what about installing pyqt didn't work for you?
2016-07-13 21:53:14	@Espyo	brb, I think my internet's acting up

2016-07-13 21:55:12	Yoshi2	that's a silly issue and I will not let you give up because of that
2016-07-13 21:55:14	Scruffy	Espyo: I do feel they were a bit directionless; or at least I had a direction for them to go that they didn't quite reach
2016-07-13 21:55:27	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-07-13 21:55:34	@Espyo	good to know it's not just my taste
2016-07-13 21:55:37	Yoshi2	did you install python 3.5?
2016-07-13 21:55:39	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-13 21:55:49	Scruffy	to Yoshi2
2016-07-13 21:56:11	Scruffy	To Espyo, I do feel that the spaciousness works better in Cosmic Kiss than in Wrath of Vulcan, which is why I prefer it
2016-07-13 21:56:26	Scruffy	But I do prefer Anchor out of all right now, that's my most recent one
2016-07-13 21:56:42	Yoshi2	did you install the 32 bit or 64 bit version of python?
2016-07-13 21:56:56	Scruffy	32 bit
2016-07-13 21:57:06	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-07-13 21:57:12	@Espyo	yeah, Anchor is quite the step up

2016-07-13 21:58:28	@Espyo	nice URL
2016-07-13 21:58:28	Yoshi2	a slightly scary looking link but I copied that from " Please use this direct link" 
2016-07-13 21:59:03	Yoshi2	aternatively, when it counts down from 5 you should be able to click on >direct link< too
2016-07-13 21:59:06	Scruffy	Aha, this time it works
2016-07-13 22:01:18	Scruffy	Oh, I need the Windows version of Python 32 bit :P

2016-07-13 22:03:07	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-13 22:06:11	Yoshi2	oh whew, that will make things a bit more complicated
2016-07-13 22:06:33	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-13 22:09:33	Yoshi2	when I start python development, I feel like "Oh yeah, for this, this and this exist installers on windows. On linux it's very easy to install and compile additional stuff." and then I forget about mac
2016-07-13 22:09:50	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-13 22:10:37	Scruffy	Yeah, Python is having trouble running on Wine
2016-07-13 22:10:40	Scruffy	Hang on a moment
2016-07-13 22:12:27	Yoshi2	there are ways to do it on mac without using wine, e.g. https://gist.github.com/guillaumevincent/10983814
2016-07-13 22:12:40	Yoshi2	but sadly, no one-click installer
2016-07-13 22:13:31	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-13 22:13:41	Scruffy	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with doing this
2016-07-13 22:14:16	--	sleepi is now known as pi
2016-07-13 22:15:56	Yoshi2	comfortable in the context of "Too much effort for me"?
2016-07-13 22:16:32	Scruffy	in the context of messing something up
2016-07-13 22:16:54	Scruffy	And also my computer is near capacity at the moment
2016-07-13 22:17:11	Scruffy	I really should dump some stuff before downloading more
2016-07-13 22:20:17	Yoshi2	as far as I can tell, nothing on that page will mess your pc up irreversibly
2016-07-13 22:20:36	Yoshi2	of course it would be easier if I had a mac to test that on
2016-07-13 22:21:11	Scruffy	Right
2016-07-13 22:21:41	Scruffy	But if I were to install PyQt5 on Mac, would it help run the BMS viewer you have? Or is that only compatible on Windows?
2016-07-13 22:22:38	Yoshi2	it should run on any platform that has pyqt5
2016-07-13 22:22:47	Scruffy	Ah ok
2016-07-13 22:23:35	Yoshi2	I could try running it on my linux system if you are not convinced :p
2016-07-13 22:24:24	Scruffy	No, that's ok, I'll try this method for Mac
2016-07-13 22:24:47	Scruffy	I'm just not great in Terminal
2016-07-13 22:24:48	Yoshi2	if you wonder what some of the lines on that page do, ask away
2016-07-13 22:25:20	Scruffy	Alright
2016-07-13 22:26:07	Yoshi2	don't have a mac, but that looks similar enough to linux that Espyo can help too
2016-07-13 22:26:20	@Espyo	eh...
2016-07-13 22:26:32	Yoshi2	no jons
2016-07-13 22:26:34	Scruffy	The first link I clicked on led me to the Apple Developer Agreement
2016-07-13 22:26:42	@Espyo	you're trying to install Python and PyQt?
2016-07-13 22:26:46	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-13 22:26:59	@Espyo	well, there's a Python package manager called pip
2016-07-13 22:27:08	@Espyo	if you can install pip, everything else should go into motion straight away
2016-07-13 22:27:21	@Espyo	you just do "pip install pyqt" or something of the sort, and it just does it
2016-07-13 22:28:50	Yoshi2	Espyo: it's not completely foolproof like that http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/07/12/installing_pyqt____because_it_s_too_good_for_pip_or_easy_install_.html
2016-07-13 22:29:19	@Espyo	:/
2016-07-13 22:32:21	Yoshi2	I guess you need xcode for "make" (which compiles the source code)
2016-07-13 22:35:14	Yoshi2	Scruffy: of course, there is no rush to do it all and if you do not manage to install everything, I'll change the tool into something that just spews out html that you will open in a browser or something like that
2016-07-13 22:35:26	Scruffy	Okay
2016-07-13 22:36:01	Scruffy	I have to go for now, but I'll try to install that and get it to work
2016-07-13 22:36:23	Yoshi2	alrighty, see ya

2016-07-13 22:38:58	Yoshi2	i think mac and windows might be tied for who has it the worst in terms of installing something
2016-07-13 22:42:03	@Espyo	hehe
2016-07-13 22:42:15	@Espyo	hard to imagine something being harder to install on Mac than windows
2016-07-13 22:45:17	Yoshi2	on mac you get a syntax similar to linux but you still have to install xcode to have make
2016-07-13 22:45:33	Yoshi2	and you don't get the packet manager of linux, I think

2016-07-13 22:50:13	@PikFan	so I got a Surface yesterday for free
2016-07-13 22:50:24	@PikFan	and...
2016-07-13 22:50:54	@PikFan	well, I have mixed feelings about it
2016-07-13 22:51:13	@PikFan	it's nice that I've got my own tablet now
2016-07-13 22:51:23	@PikFan	...but the app choices are EXTREMELY limited
2016-07-13 22:51:27	@PikFan	thanks, Windows Store
2016-07-13 22:51:48	@PikFan	beggars can't be choosers, I guess
2016-07-13 22:52:27	Yoshi2	is it a surface RT?
2016-07-13 22:53:09	Yoshi2	(with that ARM cpu that you can't run conventional programs on)
2016-07-13 22:53:16	@PikFan	yup
2016-07-13 22:53:53	@PikFan	now I'm considering if I can trade it for a better tablet
2016-07-13 22:55:43	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-07-13 22:56:02	Yoshi2	that might be tough
2016-07-13 22:56:02	@Espyo	...it was nice right up until I read the word "Windows"
2016-07-13 22:56:05	@Espyo	not so nice
2016-07-13 22:56:10	@PikFan	lol
2016-07-13 22:56:21	Yoshi2	Espyo: it was nice until PikFan confirmed it was Windows RT
2016-07-13 22:56:29	@Espyo	exactly
2016-07-13 22:56:44	@PikFan	sigh...
2016-07-13 22:56:45	Yoshi2	the regular surface tablets that run an actual windows are very good
2016-07-13 22:56:59	Yoshi2	but also quite a bit more expensive
2016-07-13 22:57:18	@PikFan	this is why I need to get a job
2016-07-13 22:57:24	@PikFan	so I can buy an actual computee

2016-07-13 23:01:49	@Espyo	the best skype runs on is on windows

2016-07-13 23:07:20	@PikFan	honestly, discord looked easier to use than skype

2016-07-13 23:09:41	@Espyo	wait, actually
2016-07-13 23:09:42	@Espyo	maybe
2016-07-13 23:09:46	@Espyo	it's on a lot of platforms
2016-07-13 23:10:00	@PikFan	nope
2016-07-13 23:10:02	@PikFan	it isn't
2016-07-13 23:10:10	@PikFan	of course it isn't, windows store sucks

2016-07-13 23:12:48	@PikFan	I can't believe journalism in general sometimes
2016-07-13 23:13:54	@PikFan	anyway, so
2016-07-13 23:14:13	@PikFan	would you happen to know why the enter key can't send messages in skype?
2016-07-13 23:18:35	@Espyo	hah
2016-07-13 23:18:47	@Espyo	sticky keys on?
2016-07-13 23:18:55	@Espyo	if you press shift+enter on skype, it adds a new line
2016-07-13 23:18:59	@Espyo	instead of sending
2016-07-13 23:19:04	@Espyo	if your shift is held and you didn't notice
2016-07-13 23:19:05	@PikFan	right
2016-07-13 23:19:19	@Espyo	or if windows glitched and thinks you're holding down shift (happened to me at least once a month back on windows)
2016-07-13 23:19:21	@Espyo	then that could be it
2016-07-13 23:19:28	@Espyo	or you enabled sticky keys by mashing shift too much
2016-07-13 23:19:34	@PikFan	I've tried shift+enter, ctrl+enter, and some other keys + enter
2016-07-13 23:19:42	@PikFan	none of them work
2016-07-13 23:19:44	@Espyo	what about the numpad?
2016-07-13 23:19:52	@PikFan	nope
2016-07-13 23:20:05	@Espyo	shift+numpad enter? :/
2016-07-13 23:20:27	@PikFan	wait, don't you mean numlock?
2016-07-13 23:21:09	@Espyo	no, I mean the Enter key on the numpad
2016-07-13 23:21:16	@PikFan	oh
2016-07-13 23:21:24	@PikFan	yeah, doesn't work
2016-07-13 23:21:26	@Espyo	as opposed to the return, new paragraph, arrow-pointing-down-then-left on the main keyboard
2016-07-13 23:21:27	@Espyo	drat
2016-07-13 23:21:32	@Espyo	then it's just skype being bad
2016-07-13 23:21:38	@PikFan	that is a yes
2016-07-13 23:21:51	@PikFan	and I've searched a lot for this issue
2016-07-13 23:22:08	@PikFan	apparently a lot of people have had this issue, but I never found a definite fix
2016-07-13 23:22:49	@Espyo	one of the main reasons I hate skype so much
2016-07-13 23:22:56	@Espyo	it's plagued with problems that shouldn't exist in the first place
2016-07-13 23:23:02	@Espyo	but the worst part is that they DON'T get fixed
2016-07-13 23:23:05	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-07-13 23:23:16	@PikFan	I'm starting to understand that now
2016-07-13 23:23:38	@PikFan	I saw something somewhere that said that IE needs to be updated

2016-07-13 23:24:12	@PikFan	well, maybe it'll work if I upgrade to win10
2016-07-13 23:24:32	@PikFan	it's at win8 right now
2016-07-13 23:25:57	@PikFan	well, on the bright side, I also got a dresser for my bedroom
2016-07-13 23:26:01	@Espyo	maybe
2016-07-13 23:26:07	@PikFan	I finally have a place to put my clothes
2016-07-13 23:26:07	@Espyo	oh, that's a bit specific

2016-07-13 23:27:57	@Espyo	cool

2016-07-14 19:33:10	@Espyo	that way there won't be shadows
2016-07-14 19:33:15	@Espyo	or at least you can make the shadows softer

2016-07-14 19:37:44	@Espyo	well, soil
2016-07-14 19:37:48	@Espyo	from the texture that's there

2016-07-14 20:09:06	@Espyo	shouldn't the twirly thing on the bottom-right be bigger?
2016-07-14 20:09:19	@Espyo	I think in Pikmin 2, it can accommodate a full army of Pikmin next to you
2016-07-14 20:09:22	@Espyo	and here... well, not even half of it
2016-07-14 20:09:36	@Espyo	then again it does seem the right size
2016-07-14 20:11:15	CraftedPbody	I went in to see if it's accurate.
2016-07-14 20:11:57	CraftedPbody	I have a puzzle planned there requiring 3 pikmin types.
2016-07-14 20:12:04	CraftedPbody	Well
2016-07-14 20:12:17	CraftedPbody	The 3 pikmin types that are given that is
2016-07-14 20:14:17	CraftedPbody	The upper area will have an electric hazard of some sort. (Electric fence or the broken wires from Pikmin 2), The upper area is also surrounded by water, so you'd need to take blue pikmin up there, the lower area around the water will have poison gas pipes.
2016-07-14 20:18:43	@Espyo	right

2016-07-14 20:30:15	@Espyo	yes
2016-07-14 20:31:29	FuturisticPikmin	If the red Pikmin attacks it again, the HP will drop to 15.

2016-07-14 23:23:03	CraftedPbody	If I set a sector with no texture to blocking will it be black? or do I need a black texture to make it black?
2016-07-14 23:24:36	@Espyo	it'll be the color of the background
2016-07-14 23:24:41	@Espyo	if you set the background of the area to red, it'll be red
2016-07-14 23:24:49	@Espyo	if you set it as a texture, it'll show the texture
2016-07-14 23:25:15	CraftedPbody	How do you change the background color for a map?
2016-07-14 23:26:56	@Espyo	open its Data.txt
2016-07-14 23:27:04	@Espyo	and there's like a bg_color, bg_texture, etc.
2016-07-14 23:27:18	@Espyo	if you can't find them on the likes of the Play area, you'll have to check the wiki, since I don't remember by heart

2016-07-14 23:29:40	CraftedPbody	so, to get black, I'd input "255 255 255"?
2016-07-14 23:30:17	@Espyo	that's white :P
2016-07-14 23:30:19	@Espyo	the opposite
2016-07-14 23:30:20	@Espyo	 0 0 0
2016-07-14 23:30:24	@Espyo	but it SHOULD already be black
2016-07-14 23:30:25	CraftedPbody	0 0 0
2016-07-14 23:30:32	@Espyo	I mean, the void is currently black, isn't it?
2016-07-14 23:30:33	CraftedPbody	no, it started white
2016-07-14 23:30:44	@Espyo	uhm
2016-07-14 23:30:47	@Espyo	that's weird
2016-07-14 23:32:22	@Espyo	oh, you probably don't want to have a sector with no texture, though
2016-07-14 23:32:24	@Espyo	the engine will complain
2016-07-14 23:32:33	@Espyo	if you want something to be see-through through the void
2016-07-14 23:32:38	@Espyo	you should set a sector as "bottomless pit"
2016-07-14 23:33:06	CraftedPbody	hm
2016-07-14 23:33:21	CraftedPbody	I might get a black texture then

2016-07-14 23:37:36	CraftedPbody	There
2016-07-14 23:38:56	@Espyo	it's not as great a choice
2016-07-14 23:39:02	@Espyo	ooh that looks great
2016-07-14 23:46:34	CraftedPbody	Wait... If you're doing dweevils, are you also doing the volatile dweevil?

2016-07-14 23:58:59	CraftedPbody	I'm going to add this can in so I can also use some of the concrete layouts with the dirt.
2016-07-14 23:59:23	CraftedPbody	And so I can modify the existing layouts
2016-07-14 23:59:52	CraftedPbody	I think the can works well with the soil themed cave
2016-07-15 00:04:33	@Espyo	oh, yeah

2016-07-15 21:57:58	@Espyo	and we'll take it from there
2016-07-15 21:59:59	Marty2000	Oh, yeah, I got all the values you needed for P2
2016-07-15 22:00:12	Marty2000	I need more values for P1 and P3, right? I'll do that tomorrow, no problem ;)
2016-07-15 22:00:20	@Espyo	all right, cool
2016-07-15 22:00:32	@Espyo	is maturity, type, or spicy, any different for P2?
2016-07-15 22:02:14	Marty2000	Hmm... I am sure it will change depending on the type (but it's worth trying), but I have no idea for the spicy status (which will impact the speed, according to me) and maturity (I think it will not change anything). I'll try tomorrow too!
2016-07-15 22:02:29	@Espyo	right
2016-07-15 22:02:42	Marty2000	I'll check the logs tomorrow to see all of that (I think they're getting updated tonight)
2016-07-15 22:03:32	Marty2000	Or, I could write it in my reminder, but I have to remember where I put it... :p
2016-07-15 22:04:04	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-07-15 22:04:09	Marty2000	I thought of certain things to try while I was away, but I don't remember where I put that, nor what it was
2016-07-15 22:04:30	Marty2000	I'll write on my computer for now
2016-07-15 22:04:37	@Espyo	that sucks, but you're sure you did point them down, right?
2016-07-15 22:04:42	@Espyo	so you should be able to find them eventually
2016-07-15 22:06:09	Marty2000	I hope so, I wrote those on a piece of paper
2016-07-15 22:08:29	Marty2000	By the way, I played Splatoon a little today... I didn't remember how easy it is to "forget" how to play that game when you haven't played it for some time
2016-07-15 22:08:54	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2016-07-15 22:08:58	@Espyo	but it shouldn't have been THAT easy
2016-07-15 22:09:07	@Espyo	you did get used to it very quickly again, though, right?
2016-07-15 22:09:11	@Espyo	it's usually how it is for me
2016-07-15 22:09:15	@Espyo	I forget the controls and some mechanics and all
2016-07-15 22:09:27	@Espyo	but since I do still remember them, I'm just not used to them, I get them back after only a few minutes
2016-07-15 22:09:36	Marty2000	It's not that I forget the controls.... but I don't react as quickly as before
2016-07-15 22:09:43	Marty2000	Yeah, that's it
2016-07-15 22:09:52	@Espyo	the reaction, really?
2016-07-15 22:09:55	@Espyo	that's interesting
2016-07-15 22:10:04	@Espyo	with most people it's just forgetting stuff
2016-07-15 22:10:14	@Espyo	you feel sluggish, then?
2016-07-15 22:10:45	Marty2000	Hmm, yeah :p
2016-07-15 22:10:58	@Espyo	maybe
2016-07-15 22:11:03	@Espyo	since you haven't played in so long
2016-07-15 22:11:09	@Espyo	you kinda lost the abstraction
2016-07-15 22:11:15	@Espyo	and your brain is taking longer to process what's going on
2016-07-15 22:11:20	@Espyo	since it all feels kinda new
2016-07-15 22:11:36	@Espyo	so instead of focusing that your solid ground spans from there to there, and there's an enemy over in the distance
2016-07-15 22:11:53	@Espyo	your brain is just seeing a lot of colors and shapes and locations and mechanics and bkljasdlasdhasd that you're not used to any more
2016-07-15 22:11:59	@Espyo	so it's slower to filter out what matters
2016-07-15 22:12:03	@Espyo	this is me completely spitballing
2016-07-15 22:12:20	@Espyo	but I noticed that, at least for me, my brain abstracts a LOT about a game when I'm playing
2016-07-15 22:12:21	Marty2000	Ha ha, yeah!
2016-07-15 22:12:35	@Espyo	like, in Smash, I just see the stage as a shape, the characters as rectangles, and nothing else exists
2016-07-15 22:12:47	@Espyo	a lot of nice details happen in the background, and I'm never conscious to them
2016-07-15 22:13:04	@Espyo	although I guess that's not entirely true, since I sometimes notice weird quirks on the background
2016-07-15 22:14:10	Marty2000	I see. Similar things happen to me sometimes as well. I rarely focus on the background (for 2D games particularly) but the exception is thr Pikmin series
2016-07-15 22:14:57	Marty2000	Well, there's only one way to react more quickly: splatoon-ing again
2016-07-15 22:15:05	@Espyo	yeah, but in the Pikmin series, we're just so engrained in the mechanics, our brains get bored by looking at the Pikmin all the time
2016-07-15 22:15:09	@Espyo	so we can afford to pay attention to something else
2016-07-15 22:15:15	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-15 22:15:50	Marty2000	Yeah, and the background is more important in Pikmin, in my opinion, so focusing on it is just part of the gameplay.
2016-07-15 22:15:59	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-07-15 22:16:07	Marty2000	I've chosen Callie for the Splatfest :)

2016-07-16 12:43:27	@Espyo	everything else connected fine
2016-07-16 12:43:28	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-07-16 12:43:32	@Espyo	doesn't seem like I'm lagging
2016-07-16 12:43:33	@Espyo	so meh
2016-07-16 12:43:37	@Espyo	hi, all
2016-07-16 12:48:00	Marty2000	So, hmm, I know what I'll do with the gates. I'll unlock Red Pikmin and Purple Pikmin, unlock the Ultra-Spicy Spray, and enter the Snagret Hole and choose a gate there... but I'll have to be careful about two things: each experiment I'll perform with the gate will have to be tested twice (to see if it's random), and speaking of randomness, I hope the gates 
2016-07-16 12:48:05	Marty2000	are not too random in caves
2016-07-16 12:48:40	Marty2000	Or I can try with the black gate in the Awakening Wood, but I'll take longer
2016-07-16 12:48:44	Marty2000	I'll try that first, actually
2016-07-16 12:49:00	Marty2000	I only need to take down one third of the gate, anyway
2016-07-16 12:51:23	@Espyo	yeah, might be better with the gate at the Awakening Wood...
2016-07-16 12:51:37	@Espyo	gates in caves are pretty random
2016-07-16 12:51:42	@Espyo	but I think they always have the same HP
2016-07-16 12:51:48	@Espyo	I wouldn't want to take my chances on it, though
2016-07-16 12:52:27	Marty2000	Which means we'll still have to test them anyway, to see if they have different "rules"
2016-07-16 12:56:09	Marty2000	[[Gate]]
2016-07-16 12:56:10	Testyo	"Gate" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Gate
2016-07-16 12:57:49	@Espyo	but that's another story, I'd say
2016-07-16 13:00:03	Marty2000	He he, yeah
2016-07-16 13:12:40	Marty2000	It's time to start. I have flower and leaf Red/Purple Pikmin, and 6 Ultra-Spicy Sprays.
2016-07-16 13:12:54	Marty2000	First,
2016-07-16 13:13:57	Marty2000	I'll try with a leaf Red Pikmin (twice), then with a flower Red Pikmin, and a "spicy" Red Pikmin. Finally, I'll redo those but with a Purple Pikmin instead
2016-07-16 13:17:22	@Espyo	okay
2016-07-16 13:17:32	@Espyo	though, it might be easier to try with like 10 of those
2016-07-16 13:17:39	@Espyo	since we're only checking if the maturity and spiciness matter
2016-07-16 13:17:42	@Espyo	the number doesn't matter
2016-07-16 13:17:50	@Espyo	might as well use a number that won't bore you to death
2016-07-16 13:17:59	Marty2000	Okay
2016-07-16 13:18:35	Marty2000	It's not so boring in that I'm doing something else beside that, but it can take time, indeed
2016-07-16 13:19:01	Marty2000	So, I'll try with 10 Pikmin.
2016-07-16 13:20:04	@Espyo	mhm
2016-07-16 13:23:21	Marty2000	3:11 min with 10 leaf Red Pikmin.
2016-07-16 13:23:30	Marty2000	I'll double-check to make sure there's no randomness
2016-07-16 13:23:39	@Espyo	mhm
2016-07-16 13:26:45	Marty2000	If you are wondering, I don't throw the 10 Pikmin directly to the gate, but I throw them to the other side and use the group-move function so that they all start attacking at once
2016-07-16 13:26:57	Marty2000	It helps have better times
2016-07-16 13:27:48	@Espyo	oh, good idea
2016-07-16 13:27:57	@Espyo	though, how can you throw them to the other side with the gate all the way up?
2016-07-16 13:28:41	Marty2000	The walls around the gate are not tall enough to prevent from throwing Pikmin
2016-07-16 13:28:51	@Espyo	oh
2016-07-16 13:28:56	Marty2000	3:11 min again
2016-07-16 13:29:01	@Espyo	hey, point that fact down somewhere
2016-07-16 13:29:05	Marty2000	So, it's not random
2016-07-16 13:29:10	@Espyo	because when you point down all of your results, it'll be important to note that too
2016-07-16 13:29:17	@Espyo	for people who are sceptical about your methods
2016-07-16 13:29:18	Marty2000	Sure
2016-07-16 13:29:32	Marty2000	Heh
2016-07-16 13:29:55	Marty2000	Now, I'll try with flower Pikmin
2016-07-16 13:34:21	Marty2000	3:11 min with flower red Pikmin. I'd say that maturity has not impact
2016-07-16 13:34:32	@Espyo	agreed
2016-07-16 13:34:33	@Espyo	now, spicy
2016-07-16 13:34:36	@Espyo	it has to have an impact
2016-07-16 13:34:38	Marty2000	Yep
2016-07-16 13:34:49	Marty2000	I think that it'll have an impact too
2016-07-16 13:39:13	Marty2000	2:25 min
2016-07-16 13:40:48	Marty2000	Should I double-check or continue with Purple Pikmin, Espyo?
2016-07-16 13:45:07	@Espyo	please double check
2016-07-16 13:45:16	@Espyo	we both know how crazy Pikmin 2 is :P
2016-07-16 13:54:29	Marty2000	Sure 
2016-07-16 13:54:31	Marty2000	Indeed :p
2016-07-16 13:57:31	Marty2000	I don't know if it's mentioned in [[Ultra-spicy spray]], but you know, when you spray your Pikmin for the first time, there's a cutscene... the duration left before the Pikmin gets back to normal decreases during that cutscene (I don't know for P3)
2016-07-16 13:57:32	Testyo	"Ultra-spicy_spray" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Ultra-spicy_spray
2016-07-16 13:59:55	Marty2000	I got the same time
2016-07-16 14:00:00	Marty2000	So it wasn't random
2016-07-16 14:00:02	@Espyo	oh, so in other words, the timer runs down during the cutscene?
2016-07-16 14:00:14	Marty2000	Yes
2016-07-16 14:02:04	Marty2000	Now, with Purple Pikmin...
2016-07-16 14:02:34	@Espyo	yep, not on the wiki
2016-07-16 14:02:39	@Espyo	I guess I'll try to check
2016-07-16 14:02:49	@Espyo	uhm
2016-07-16 14:02:51	@Espyo	wait
2016-07-16 14:02:54	@Espyo	I meant "I guess I'll add it"
2016-07-16 14:03:05	@Espyo	and then I was also thinking to myself "I can try to check P3"
2016-07-16 14:03:07	Marty2000	Sure
2016-07-16 14:03:11	@Espyo	and both my thoughts got mangled lol
2016-07-16 14:03:15	Marty2000	Hah
2016-07-16 14:06:45	Marty2000	2:25 with Purple Pikmin
2016-07-16 14:06:59	Marty2000	And I am sure they'll take the same time if they are sprayed
2016-07-16 14:07:07	Marty2000	It's like the digging speeds
2016-07-16 14:07:12	Marty2000	Don't you think, Espyo?
2016-07-16 14:10:20	@Espyo	maybe not
2016-07-16 14:10:24	@Espyo	but it's important to check
2016-07-16 14:11:50	Marty2000	I'll check with the Ultra-Spicy spray then
2016-07-16 14:12:07	Marty2000	But to me, it works like the digging speeds ;)
2016-07-16 14:12:25	@Espyo	probably
2016-07-16 14:12:33	@Espyo	ok, I checked the spicy cutscene in P3
2016-07-16 14:12:39	@Espyo	the timer doesn't go down
2016-07-16 14:13:03	@Espyo	but now I'll try skipping the cutscene
2016-07-16 14:13:19	@Espyo	I have a hunch that the code that ends the cutscene normally and the code that skips it do different things
2016-07-16 14:13:25	@Espyo	and they might've forgotten about the skipping scenario
2016-07-16 14:13:36	Marty2000	I see
2016-07-16 14:17:34	@Espyo	skipping works too
2016-07-16 14:17:51	Marty2000	AQnd I got the same time
2016-07-16 14:17:53	Marty2000	And*
2016-07-16 14:18:01	Marty2000	I wonder what would happen if you skipped the cutscene in P2
2016-07-16 14:18:09	Marty2000	You cannot skip them on the Wii version
2016-07-16 14:18:17	@Espyo	uhm
2016-07-16 14:18:18	@Espyo	that's weird

2016-07-16 14:21:07	Marty2000	So for example, you cannot skip the "cave discovered" cutscene, the "berry brought to the ship" cutscene, etc.
2016-07-16 14:21:13	@Espyo	weird

2016-07-16 15:38:50	Marty2000	Its back
2016-07-16 15:53:18	Marty2000	I really don't see what bug this screenshot has
2016-07-16 15:55:24	@Espyo	the angle it's at
2016-07-16 15:55:31	@Espyo	is it on the ground, or on a wall?
2016-07-16 15:55:42	@Espyo	and what's with those sacks next to the mouth?
2016-07-16 15:56:19	Marty2000	Those sacks are its arms. And it's on a slope
2016-07-16 15:57:09	@Espyo	how are its arms above its mouth?
2016-07-16 15:57:47	Marty2000	When it dies, it places its arms near its mouth (same for the other larvae)
2016-07-16 15:58:21	@Espyo	great, as if I wasn't having a hard time grasping anatomy and positioning right now, my dog, on my bed, decided to lay down such that her torso is lying on her side, her stomach is up, and her neck is the opposite way of her torso
2016-07-16 15:59:15	Marty2000	Ha ha!
2016-07-16 15:59:34	@Espyo	I still don't understand how the beetle is :/
2016-07-16 16:00:19	Marty2000	Kill one in-game and you will understand.... or I could take a screenshot of it dead from further if you'd like
2016-07-16 16:00:46	@Espyo	we should have a screenshot of a dead one anyway
2016-07-16 16:00:50	@Espyo	we currently don't
2016-07-16 16:00:57	@Espyo	I'll give it a whirl
2016-07-16 16:01:00	Marty2000	Okay
2016-07-16 16:07:15	@Espyo	oh, I finally get it
2016-07-16 16:07:19	@Espyo	we're not looking at its BACK
2016-07-16 16:07:21	@Espyo	we're looking at its tail
2016-07-16 16:09:25	Marty2000	Yes, its tail, sorry
2016-07-16 16:09:50	@Espyo	ah

2016-07-16 18:08:16	@Espyo	so far, it looks Mission Modey
2016-07-16 18:08:30	@Espyo	it doesn't feel... laid out in the way a story mode area would
2016-07-16 18:08:39	@Espyo	then again the big arena at the start kind of does
2016-07-16 18:09:10	CraftedPbody	The start is going to have 2 exits
2016-07-16 18:09:27	CraftedPbody	The one I already made and a south-facing exit.
2016-07-16 18:09:32	@Espyo	right
2016-07-16 18:09:58	CraftedPbody	I think I might have to expand the north exit.
2016-07-16 18:14:52	CraftedPbody	I'll be working on this for a while and I'll show you when I've made a good amount of progress.

2016-07-16 21:05:30	@Espyo	I'm thinking you can give the walls around it a different texture
2016-07-16 21:05:35	@Espyo	and also make the entrances a bit tighter
2016-07-16 21:05:42	@Espyo	that should give the illusion that you went from outdoors to indoors

2016-07-16 22:18:36	CraftedPbody	The reason why I ask Espyo, is because I wanted to have Armored Cannon Beetle Larvae in this map.
2016-07-16 22:18:48	CraftedPbody	It seems like a good map for Lithopods
2016-07-16 22:20:40	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/6aba2701757bed72c9da24f1b31d894c.png small update on the map

2016-07-16 22:21:11	@Espyo	looking good
2016-07-16 22:21:33	CraftedPbody	I'm reserving a spot incase I can put an armored cannon larva in.
2016-07-16 22:21:34	@Espyo	though it might be smart to use a different rock texture for the oob parts
2016-07-16 22:22:10	CraftedPbody	The Forest Navel doesn't use a different texture.
2016-07-16 22:22:43	CraftedPbody	just a slightly darker version of the normal texture.
2016-07-16 22:24:52	@Espyo	oh
2016-07-16 22:24:58	@Espyo	well, that might work too
2016-07-16 22:25:05	@Espyo	yeah, since you're not meant to be there, might as well make the sectors dark
2016-07-16 22:25:21	@Espyo	oh, wait, but that'll darken the objects on it too
2016-07-16 22:25:22	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2016-07-16 22:25:25	@Espyo	you know what I should do?
2016-07-16 22:25:36	@Espyo	add an advanced texture setting that allows you to color the texture
2016-07-16 22:25:40	@Espyo	that way you could darken it at will
2016-07-16 22:26:06	CraftedPbody	I modified the texture and saved it as a different texture.
2016-07-16 22:26:23	@Espyo	yeah, that works, but is a bit more intensive
2016-07-16 22:26:24	@Espyo	space-wise
2016-07-16 22:26:26	CraftedPbody	So I'll use this darker version for the OoB areas

2016-07-16 22:31:23	CraftedPbody	slightly darker in comparison
2016-07-16 22:31:44	CraftedPbody	I also added some more red
2016-07-16 22:32:12	CraftedPbody	It blends in and looks different.
2016-07-16 22:34:37	CraftedPbody	Hey PikFan, what do you think of this map?
2016-07-16 22:34:50	@PikFan	ooh
2016-07-16 22:34:58	@PikFan	it kinda looks like the Forest Navel
2016-07-16 22:35:29	CraftedPbody	Draws design inspiration from the Forest Navel
2016-07-16 22:35:51	CraftedPbody	I wanted to make a desert to see how it could turn out.
2016-07-16 22:36:11	@Espyo	oh that looks much better
2016-07-16 22:36:19	CraftedPbody	But I needed to look at a rocky map from a pikmin game
2016-07-16 22:36:57	CraftedPbody	I call this area the Sunbaked Valley
2016-07-16 22:49:41	@Espyo	heh, nice
2016-07-16 22:53:36	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-07-16 22:54:26	CraftedPbody	Also, to be very specific about inspirations that came from the Forest Navel, the landing area is inspired by the Beady Long Legs arena.
2016-07-16 22:54:41	@PikFan	neat

2016-07-16 23:25:34	@Espyo	yeah, that bridge is kinda pointless
2016-07-16 23:30:39	CraftedPbody	instead, when the hazard update is ready, I'll put an electric gate up there
2016-07-16 23:30:53	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-16 23:36:54	CraftedPbody	I think I'm going to replace the Cloaking burrow-nit with something else

2016-07-17 01:26:05	CraftedPbody	Hey PikFan I have a question with the fanon
2016-07-17 01:26:12	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-07-17 01:26:23	CraftedPbody	is it possible to make a spoiler?
2016-07-17 01:26:29	@PikFan	yep
2016-07-17 01:26:33	@PikFan	there's a spoiler template
2016-07-17 01:27:12	@PikFan	{{spoiler}}
2016-07-17 01:29:06	CraftedPbody	So, what does the spoiler do?
2016-07-17 01:29:24	CraftedPbody	Does it hide the portion that is tagged?
2016-07-17 01:29:36	CraftedPbody	Or does it just cross it off?
2016-07-17 01:29:57	CraftedPbody	oh
2016-07-17 01:29:59	CraftedPbody	Wait
2016-07-17 01:29:59	CraftedPbody	Ok
2016-07-17 01:30:23	@PikFan	yeah, it's a spoiler marker, like the one on Pikipedia
2016-07-17 01:30:43	@PikFan	wait do you have the page or no
2016-07-17 01:34:48	@PikFan	oh, by the way
2016-07-17 01:35:06	CraftedPbody	Ok, so it doesn't hide the information, but it marks the portion as a spoiler.
2016-07-17 01:35:13	@PikFan	yup
2016-07-17 01:35:42	CraftedPbody	apparently the spoiler that hides the info is broken at the moment.
2016-07-17 01:35:53	CraftedPbody	How broken is it?
2016-07-17 01:36:03	@PikFan	not sure, haven't bothered with it
2016-07-17 01:36:13	@PikFan	I could ask Espyo to take a look
2016-07-17 01:36:42	@PikFan	if anything, all we need to do is copy/paste Pikipedia's version
2016-07-17 01:37:19	@PikFan	yeah, we can copy this http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Spoiler_section
2016-07-17 01:37:41	@PikFan	does that work?
2016-07-17 01:38:24	@PikFan	...oh, Fanon already has a spoiler section template of its own
2016-07-17 01:38:25	@PikFan	hmm
2016-07-17 01:39:00	@PikFan	well, it's not as fancy as Pikipedia's, but it just might be what you're looking for http://www.pikminfanon.com/Template:Spoiler_section
2016-07-17 01:44:54	@PikFan	by the way, I recently made a Skype account since someone on Miiverse invited me to their Splatoon group
2016-07-17 01:45:06	@PikFan	so I was wondering if you could add me to the Pikmin Wiki group
2016-07-17 01:48:33	CraftedPbody	We don't use skype anymore
2016-07-17 01:48:38	CraftedPbody	We use discord
2016-07-17 01:48:54	@PikFan	I thought you hadn't switched yet
2016-07-17 01:49:05	@PikFan	well, I guess I'm a bit late :P
2016-07-17 01:49:06	CraftedPbody	nope, we switched
2016-07-17 01:49:10	CraftedPbody	lol
2016-07-17 01:50:00	@PikFan	in that case, can you add me to the Discord group?
2016-07-17 01:52:21	CraftedPbody	Well, 'I' can't but CreativeSushi can, let me try and get him in here.

2016-07-17 02:34:43	CraftedPbody	I post this here because a few of the people on the discord chat frown upon all of the fanon community.
2016-07-17 02:35:17	@PikFan	heh, why do they frown upon it?
2016-07-17 02:35:38	@PikFan	like the bad users and stuff
2016-07-17 02:35:54	CraftedPbody	because a lot of cringey stuff comes out of the fanon.
2016-07-17 02:36:02	@PikFan	^
2016-07-17 02:36:16	CraftedPbody	Dark Giant Breadbug to give an example
2016-07-17 02:37:04	CraftedPbody	That was the fanon wikia though
2016-07-17 02:37:14	@PikFan	oh, the wikia version
2016-07-17 02:37:25	CraftedPbody	That was before the merge
2016-07-17 02:37:38	@PikFan	mhm
2016-07-17 02:37:48	CraftedPbody	But they still hold their views on fanon content
2016-07-17 02:38:03	@PikFan	have they even looked at the "new" wiki?
2016-07-17 02:38:36	@PikFan	the ones who don't think highly of it, I mean
2016-07-17 02:39:24	CraftedPbody	yeah
2016-07-17 02:39:36	CraftedPbody	They found this : [[Death Spiked Burrowing Snagret]]
2016-07-17 02:39:39	CraftedPbody	Er
2016-07-17 02:39:46	@PikFan	yeah

2016-07-17 02:39:48	CraftedPbody	That
2016-07-17 02:39:49	@PikFan	it's dumb
2016-07-17 02:40:09	@PikFan	LoganPikmin has a lotta issues
2016-07-17 02:40:37	CraftedPbody	yup
2016-07-17 02:41:46	@PikFan	I actually ranted on his talk page some days ago cause I was getting frustrated with his editing http://www.pikminfanon.com/User_talk:LoganPikmin#Recent_edits
2016-07-17 02:42:03	@PikFan	he's too young to pick up on the underlying irritation, probably
2016-07-17 02:42:16	@PikFan	but you can definitely see it
2016-07-17 02:43:14	@PikFan	tbh I just hope he does something stupid so I can ban him already
2016-07-17 02:44:33	CraftedPbody	I kind of want to see that too
2016-07-17 02:44:49	@PikFan	hehe
2016-07-17 02:45:02	CraftedPbody	He'd have to do something REALLY stupid to merit a banning though wouldn't he?
2016-07-17 02:45:13	@PikFan	probably, yeah
2016-07-17 02:45:27	CraftedPbody	Otherwise probably just a temp ban.
2016-07-17 02:45:34	@PikFan	but insubordination could warrant a — yep, temp ban
2016-07-17 02:45:50	CraftedPbody	Of Course, if he persists.
2016-07-17 02:45:59	CraftedPbody	You could get him then
2016-07-17 02:46:04	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-07-17 02:46:28	@PikFan	and there's no chance of him improving his edits in the near future
2016-07-17 02:46:31	@PikFan	he just doesn't care
2016-07-17 02:47:24	@PikFan	by the way, I'm probably gonna go through your game article tomorrow and fix it up a bit
2016-07-17 02:47:40	@PikFan	just letting you know now
2016-07-17 02:49:27	CraftedPbody	Ok
2016-07-17 02:50:09	CraftedPbody	Yeah, if you can improve my grammar anywhere, that'd be good, I think I did alright, but I'm unsure
2016-07-17 02:50:22	@PikFan	it's mainly the headers
2016-07-17 02:50:44	@PikFan	usually we use header 2, not header 3 :P
2016-07-17 02:50:44	CraftedPbody	I saved it as is, but I need to make some edits.
2016-07-17 02:51:12	@PikFan	right
2016-07-17 02:51:15	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-07-17 02:51:31	@PikFan	back to the topic of fanon's cringiness
2016-07-17 02:51:46	@PikFan	have the critical users seen my game at all?
2016-07-17 02:51:59	CraftedPbody	I don't believe so
2016-07-17 02:52:12	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-07-17 02:52:29	@PikFan	I still need to implement my changes...
2016-07-17 02:52:44	@PikFan	and since it's summertime and all, I should be doing that
2016-07-17 02:52:48	@PikFan	but I'm so lazy :P
2016-07-17 02:53:38	@PikFan	brb
2016-07-17 02:55:45	@PikFan	...and of course my surface is updating
2016-07-17 02:55:46	@PikFan	sigh
2016-07-17 02:55:52	CraftedPbody	Oh... but on the topic of cringiness... last year, they found the old version of the Sudoric Bulblax image I made, before I got Scruffy to make a model for me. A lot of them were laughing about it in a call, not knowing it was mine until I said so. It was not a fun time... Even Espyo was laughing about it.
2016-07-17 02:56:17	@PikFan	:\
2016-07-17 02:56:26	CraftedPbody	I cri every tim
2016-07-17 02:56:34	CraftedPbody	lol
2016-07-17 02:56:42	@PikFan	well, based on what you have told me...
2016-07-17 02:56:55	@PikFan	idk, they feel kinda elitist
2016-07-17 02:57:04	CraftedPbody	But, I couldn't do anything about the image quality, I only had Paint...
2016-07-17 02:57:10	@PikFan	yeah
2016-07-17 02:57:52	@PikFan	but I mean, I don't want to come off as rude, that's just my impression
2016-07-17 02:57:56	CraftedPbody	Then Luther said, 'Atleast you actually came up with your own design instead of recoloring Pikmin 2 art.'
2016-07-17 02:58:07	@PikFan	I'm guilty of that
2016-07-17 02:58:15	CraftedPbody	Really?
2016-07-17 02:58:19	@PikFan	yep
2016-07-17 02:59:28	@PikFan	yeah, this is one of them http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/8/82/Fire_emperor.jpg
2016-07-17 03:00:23	@PikFan	but then Scruffy made an amazing render based off it http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/a/ae/Infernal_Emperor_Bulblax_by_Scruffy.png
2016-07-17 03:03:31	@PikFan	yes!
2016-07-17 03:03:38	@PikFan	Discord works from my surface
2016-07-17 03:03:53	@PikFan	now I can stay on even after the computer locks me out
2016-07-17 03:04:10	@PikFan	(I'm 16 and I have a curfew. so embarrassing) 
2016-07-17 03:04:16	@PikFan	((computer isn't even mine))
2016-07-17 03:04:21	@PikFan	(((oh well)))
2016-07-17 03:07:42	CraftedPbody	I also am 16. I do and don't have a curfew... I don't specifically have to go to bed at any time, I just can't be loud and I can't stay up until everyone else is waking up (They get upset).
2016-07-17 03:07:51	CraftedPbody	This computer is mine though.
2016-07-17 03:07:57	@PikFan	yeah
2016-07-17 03:08:09	@PikFan	that's why I need to get a computer of my own, so it won't lock me out
2016-07-17 03:08:21	@PikFan	so I should get a job
2016-07-17 03:08:34	CraftedPbody	same
2016-07-17 03:08:36	@PikFan	could also get other things I've been wanting
2016-07-17 03:09:01	CraftedPbody	I need to find a job, but it's hard at 16... especially if you don't own a car.
2016-07-17 03:09:21	@PikFan	I don't even have my permit yet lol
2016-07-17 03:09:28	CraftedPbody	same
2016-07-17 03:09:32	@PikFan	tbh I thought you were older, like 17 or 18
2016-07-17 03:09:37	CraftedPbody	nope
2016-07-17 03:09:51	CraftedPbody	I am the youngest in the main group
2016-07-17 03:10:01	@PikFan	ah
2016-07-17 03:10:19	CraftedPbody	There was another guy who was also 16, but he's awful...
2016-07-17 03:10:20	@PikFan	wait, what year were you born
2016-07-17 03:10:29	CraftedPbody	And VERY irresponsible
2016-07-17 03:10:30	CraftedPbody	...
2016-07-17 03:10:42	CraftedPbody	Oh, I was born Oct. 9 1999
2016-07-17 03:10:53	@PikFan	you're older than me :P
2016-07-17 03:11:04	@PikFan	now you're not the youngest anymore :P
2016-07-17 03:11:21	CraftedPbody	Oh, so I now pass the title of Pikipedia Baby to you then.
2016-07-17 03:11:30	CraftedPbody	Enjoy your crown
2016-07-17 03:11:31	@PikFan	congratulations
2016-07-17 03:11:37	@PikFan	to the both of us
2016-07-17 03:11:53	@PikFan	I honestly don't mind
2016-07-17 03:12:04	CraftedPbody	I didn't either.
2016-07-17 03:12:10	@PikFan	I've been in IRC for years and I've been the youngest
2016-07-17 03:12:36	@PikFan	well, the youngest regular, that is, since some users from Fanon would show up every now and then that are younger than me
2016-07-17 03:12:39	@PikFan	but they don't count >:u
2016-07-17 03:13:09	@PikFan	*cough*LoganPikmin*cough*
2016-07-17 03:13:15	CraftedPbody	Funny thing about the wiki is that I've actually known some of the people in the main group from other sites on the internet WAY before I actually joined the Pikmin Wiki

2016-07-17 03:15:19	@PikFan	alright, so hopefully mibbit won't disconnect on the Surface
2016-07-17 03:15:55	@PikFan	on devices other than a proper, actual computer, mibbit tends to disconnect if I'm in another tab, so I really hope I don't d/c
2016-07-17 03:16:59	CraftedPbody	huh
2016-07-17 03:18:31	CraftedPbody	Also, I apologize if you see me asking opinions way too much... On the wiki... I like to read any input available.
2016-07-17 03:18:43	@PikFan	oh no, it's totally fine
2016-07-17 03:18:44	CraftedPbody	I create a lot of stuff
2016-07-17 03:18:55	@PikFan	I ask for input a lot too, so no worries :P
2016-07-17 03:19:07	@PikFan	especially when I was writing my fanfiction
2016-07-17 03:19:48	@PikFan	and then I became obsessed with input to the point where I didn't really care about the story itself anymore :\
2016-07-17 03:19:55	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-07-17 03:20:09	CraftedPbody	I also love to give information when I can.
2016-07-17 03:20:15	@PikFan	same
2016-07-17 03:20:42	CraftedPbody	to the point where some people tend to ignore me in calls and in the chat... :/
2016-07-17 03:21:18	CraftedPbody	I don't mean to talk so much, I just like to socialize... A lot.
2016-07-17 03:21:30	@PikFan	I feel like the one who's talking a lot
2016-07-17 03:21:45	@PikFan	because I go like 3-4 lines of text without you saying something :P
2016-07-17 03:22:46	@PikFan	huh, who's Dreaded Demon?
2016-07-17 03:23:00	CraftedPbody	If I do get annoying though in the chat, please bring it to my attention. The others don't really tell me when I'm being annoying so they ignore me.
2016-07-17 03:23:07	CraftedPbody	Dreaded Demon is Ryen
2016-07-17 03:23:11	@PikFan	hm
2016-07-17 03:23:25	@PikFan	lol, I guess we share the same insecurity
2016-07-17 03:23:41	@PikFan	I worry too much about talking a lot and annoying people
2016-07-17 03:23:53	@PikFan	it's why I barely text people
2016-07-17 03:24:02	CraftedPbody	Atleast we get eachother
2016-07-17 03:24:18	@PikFan	yeah
2016-07-17 03:24:26	CraftedPbody	Say... Do you have a mic?
2016-07-17 03:24:41	@PikFan	well, my surface has a built in mic
2016-07-17 03:24:49	@PikFan	why, do you want me to join a voice chat?
2016-07-17 03:25:07	CraftedPbody	We don't do calls very often in the discord, but when we do, it's usually best to have a mic.
2016-07-17 03:25:26	@PikFan	:P
2016-07-17 03:25:28	CraftedPbody	People who type are usually not read.
2016-07-17 03:25:38	@PikFan	lame
2016-07-17 03:26:04	CraftedPbody	Cameron (Leretz) knows this pain the worst...
2016-07-17 03:26:18	@PikFan	huh, does he not have a mic?
2016-07-17 03:27:21	CraftedPbody	Well... He lives in Luxembourg so it's usually late when the rest of us are active... Due to this he's not able to use his mic.
2016-07-17 03:27:34	CraftedPbody	And currently his mic is broken.
2016-07-17 03:28:10	@PikFan	oh, that's too bad
2016-07-17 03:28:42	@PikFan	why tf won't Discord run on my surface >_>
2016-07-17 03:29:06	@PikFan	I tried downloading the app but my surface is saying "This app can't run on your PC" >_>
2016-07-17 03:29:28	@PikFan	it's said that for a couple other apps too
2016-07-17 03:29:36	@PikFan	thanks, Windows store
2016-07-17 03:30:47	CraftedPbody	You read over Pikmin : Infinite Exploration though right? If so do you recall the area names?
2016-07-17 03:31:06	@PikFan	I recall Sunbaked Valley
2016-07-17 03:31:59	CraftedPbody	These are all mostly supposed to have interesting things about them, for example, Reminiscent Wilds is a map that has all of the Pikmin 1 maps combined.
2016-07-17 03:32:26	@PikFan	nice
2016-07-17 03:32:41	@PikFan	oh, Scruffy's Daybreak Glade has all Pikmin 2 maps in it
2016-07-17 03:32:53	CraftedPbody	In P:IE all areas will have multiple landing spots.
2016-07-17 03:33:03	CraftedPbody	oh really?
2016-07-17 03:33:18	@PikFan	you must be drawing inspiration from Pikmin Forever, since PF also has that feature :P
2016-07-17 03:33:29	CraftedPbody	no actually
2016-07-17 03:33:38	@PikFan	I was joking lol
2016-07-17 03:33:44	CraftedPbody	lol
2016-07-17 03:34:13	@PikFan	it's so hard to tell sarcasm in written language
2016-07-17 03:34:24	@PikFan	you can't hear the little nuances or read body language
2016-07-17 03:34:46	CraftedPbody	yeah...
2016-07-17 03:36:13	CraftedPbody	So another interesting detail about an area : Bellowing Burrow, the final area of P:IE is a grubdog breeding ground.
2016-07-17 03:36:40	CraftedPbody	The final boss.... While it's probably obvious by that context... is a secret for now.
2016-07-17 03:37:41	@PikFan	hmm, that does sound interesting
2016-07-17 03:38:53	@PikFan	oh, your upgrade evolutions kinda remind me of my upgrades in my fangame
2016-07-17 03:39:16	@PikFan	I have all the upgrades from P2, as well as "extensions" of them
2016-07-17 03:39:36	@PikFan	like, the extension of the Mega Tweeter is the Giga Tweeter
2016-07-17 03:39:59	CraftedPbody	Stygian Subterrain is an area where the player mostly has to depend on bio-luminescent enemies and the occasional Colossal Glowcap.
2016-07-17 03:40:28	@PikFan	hmm, is that where the carryable Glowcap is found?
2016-07-17 03:40:34	CraftedPbody	yup
2016-07-17 03:40:37	@PikFan	neat5
2016-07-17 03:40:53	@PikFan	*-5
2016-07-17 03:41:09	CraftedPbody	Also, my fangame is going to have a combination of Pikmin 2 and Pikmin 3 caves
2016-07-17 03:41:22	CraftedPbody	though Pikmin 2 caves are reworked.
2016-07-17 03:42:44	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-07-17 03:42:53	@PikFan	I'm not sure how to do caves in my game
2016-07-17 03:43:19	@PikFan	for now, they're P2 caves, except all sublevels are set; they're not randomized
2016-07-17 03:43:28	CraftedPbody	Also I have an idea for tree dungeons
2016-07-17 03:43:43	@PikFan	I think that idea has been explored
2016-07-17 03:43:50	@PikFan	but what is it?
2016-07-17 03:46:04	CraftedPbody	basically, it's like a Pikmin 2 cave but you climb up it instead (there are areas similar to the walkway up the scornet maestro's tree from pikmin 3) Geysers are replaced with Leaves in these tree dungeons that float the pikmin back down to the surface.
2016-07-17 03:46:25	@PikFan	hehe, neat
2016-07-17 03:48:00	CraftedPbody	There are also usually specific enemies in these trees. A lot of enemies that usually don't show up underground, but show up on the surface can be found in tree dungeons.
2016-07-17 03:48:32	@PikFan	I see
2016-07-17 03:48:44	@PikFan	well, you'll definitely have to make an article for that
2016-07-17 03:48:50	@PikFan	that's a very interesting concept
2016-07-17 03:48:50	CraftedPbody	Empress bulblax will never be seen in a tree dungeon.
2016-07-17 03:50:05	CraftedPbody	I'm going to work on P:IE a bit now, since I still have some work to be done.
2016-07-17 03:50:26	CraftedPbody	I'll still be in the chat of course, but I might not instantly respond
2016-07-17 03:51:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-07-17 03:51:20	@PikFan	that's fine
2016-07-17 03:54:05	CraftedPbody	What do you think of the Omega versions of the upgrades?
2016-07-17 03:56:04	@PikFan	hmm
2016-07-17 03:58:10	@PikFan	well, the Omega version of the Metal Suit Z seems kinda OP
2016-07-17 03:58:20	@PikFan	I mean healing when an enemy bites you?
2016-07-17 03:58:49	CraftedPbody	Well, you can only have one suit upgrade per captain
2016-07-17 03:59:23	CraftedPbody	If the president is wearing Metal Suit Omega, Olimar and Alph can't wear it.
2016-07-17 03:59:41	CraftedPbody	I'm actually adding that part into the article right now.
2016-07-17 04:00:24	CraftedPbody	And the way it's unlocked kind of justifies it further.
2016-07-17 04:03:47	CraftedPbody	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_:_Infinite_Exploration
2016-07-17 04:10:49	@PikFan	hm
2016-07-17 04:16:22	CraftedPbody	I'm working on another suit type.
2016-07-17 04:18:40	@PikFan	oh, neat
2016-07-17 04:18:43	@PikFan	what's it do?
2016-07-17 04:19:59	CraftedPbody	It's the comfy-clad series, the cheapest group of upgrades. (And for a good reason)
2016-07-17 04:20:52	CraftedPbody	It's ready if you want to read it.

2016-07-17 09:46:32	@PikFan	oh, I guess I forgot to tell you
2016-07-17 09:46:49	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-07-17 09:46:51	@PikFan	I got a Microsoft Surface recently, so I've been using that when the laptop locks me out
2016-07-17 09:47:00	@PikFan	so I'm on the surface right now
2016-07-17 09:47:06	Marty2000	Nice
2016-07-17 09:50:15	@PikFan	I'm talking with my Splatoon Skype group right now
2016-07-17 09:50:24	@PikFan	some of the members are still up :P
2016-07-17 09:50:51	Marty2000	I'm going to play Splatoon, he he
2016-07-17 09:51:15	Marty2000	I see you are in a private battle... hmm, did you make it? Would I be authorized to join?
2016-07-17 09:51:28	@PikFan	you can probably join
2016-07-17 09:51:32	@PikFan	it's a squid party
2016-07-17 09:51:48	Marty2000	Okay

2016-07-17 09:56:25	@PikFan	sorry :/
2016-07-17 09:56:53	Marty2000	For "fun" and "funny", I got confused for a second probably because I usually use "funny", heh
2016-07-17 09:56:58	Marty2000	No problem, it's not your fault
2016-07-17 09:56:59	@PikFan	I left

2016-07-17 09:57:39	Marty2000	I'll join it then ;)
2016-07-17 09:58:24	@PikFan	okay

2016-07-17 09:58:36	@PikFan	password is 2014

2016-07-17 09:59:44	Marty2000	Oh, also, come to think of it, do you play Animal Crossing New Leaf from time to time? I wanted to ask you while I was away because I had my 3DS, but I never got the opportunity to
2016-07-17 09:59:57	Marty2000	Well, only once, but I forgot :/
2016-07-17 10:00:06	@PikFan	I CAN play it, just haven't decided to
2016-07-17 10:00:11	Marty2000	Okay
2016-07-17 10:05:43	Marty2000	I only used the Bubbler :p
2016-07-17 10:05:50	@PikFan	my friend Janella is afraid of you :P
2016-07-17 10:06:07	Marty2000	I was more afraid of both of you, actually
2016-07-17 10:06:09	Marty2000	Heh
2016-07-17 10:06:27	@PikFan	why, because we had a squelcher and a dynamo?
2016-07-17 10:06:56	Marty2000	Because I was alone, I haven't played for so long that it's become harder to play, and because you are both good players ;)
2016-07-17 10:07:14	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-07-17 10:10:16	Marty2000	Lol
2016-07-17 10:12:37	Marty2000	When you got me with the bombs

2016-07-17 10:22:10	Marty2000	Hmm, well, I'll take it then
2016-07-17 10:22:18	@PikFan	but yeah, I kinda wanna see a 1vs1 between you and my friend
2016-07-17 10:22:22	Marty2000	I wasn't doing that good with the roller
2016-07-17 10:22:26	@PikFan	he's pretty good with the Heavy Splatling
2016-07-17 10:22:28	Marty2000	Okay

2016-07-17 10:30:17	@PikFan	well, what did you think?
2016-07-17 10:30:18	Marty2000	Indeed, he's very good with it
2016-07-17 10:32:18	@PikFan	2vs2 now
2016-07-17 10:32:44	Marty2000	Ocelot doesn't play...

2016-07-17 10:49:54	@PikFan	the E-litre didn't help you out much that match
2016-07-17 10:50:09	@PikFan	if you had a closer-ranged weapon, you probably would've been more successful
2016-07-17 10:50:13	Marty2000	Yes
2016-07-17 10:55:46	Marty2000	Good match

2016-07-17 11:04:10	@PikFan	Marty, Davidsfire thought that you were getting upset because Janella wasn't playing
2016-07-17 11:04:14	Marty2000	Because UltraMario's bad habit is to not say "hello". He recently changed to say "hi" every two hours, which is not really better either
2016-07-17 11:04:22	Marty2000	I wasn't upset at all
2016-07-17 11:04:29	@PikFan	:P
2016-07-17 11:04:40	Marty2000	Don't worry ;)

2016-07-17 11:25:27	@PikFan	permit at 15, license at 16
2016-07-17 11:25:32	Marty2000	I see
2016-07-17 11:25:50	@PikFan	the permit allows you to drive, but you must have someone over 21 in the car with you

2016-07-17 11:26:25	@PikFan	I don't know if they have anything similar in the EU
2016-07-17 11:27:15	Marty2000	Hmm, I know that in France, you have "conduite accompagnée": you can start driving a car from 16 (and not for a long time) if you are with someone who has the permit in your car (and that is 18 or more)
2016-07-17 11:27:51	@PikFan	I see, well then that's like our permit then
2016-07-17 11:28:17	@PikFan	now that you mention it, I think the 21 year old also has to have their license

2016-07-17 15:05:08	FuturisticPikmin	I am playing Bingo Battle solo.
2016-07-17 15:05:52	FuturisticPikmin	And Espyo, guess what I found?
2016-07-17 15:06:22	FuturisticPikmin	That there is a 50 Pikmin Limit in Bingo Battle.
2016-07-17 15:07:37	FuturisticPikmin	Testyo, what is the maximum Pikmin you can have on the Field?
2016-07-17 15:07:37	Testyo	I don't know what the maximum Pikmin you can have on the Field? means!
2016-07-17 15:07:51	Marty2000	Hi FuturisticPikmin
2016-07-17 15:07:59	FuturisticPikmin	Hi.
2016-07-17 15:08:05	@Espyo	well, yeah
2016-07-17 15:08:08	@Espyo	it's 50 in the two-player modes
2016-07-17 15:08:32	FuturisticPikmin	So that is half of the Pikmin limit in story mode.
2016-07-17 15:08:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-17 15:08:40	Marty2000	Each team can have up to 50 Pikmin, right?
2016-07-17 15:08:44	FuturisticPikmin	Yes
2016-07-17 15:08:47	@Espyo	but since each player gets 50, it's still 100 on the area in total
2016-07-17 15:08:49	Marty2000	So, I'd say it's theoretically still 100

2016-07-17 15:23:29	Yoshi2	no shit
2016-07-17 15:23:29	Testyo	You must be really upset if you're swearing. What can I do to help?

2016-07-17 15:23:44	Yoshi2	[16:10:09] <FuturisticPikmin> Don't end the day when you have started it.
2016-07-17 15:23:44	Yoshi2	[16:10:21] <FuturisticPikmin> That is called WASTING A DAY.

2016-07-17 17:07:08	Marty2000	Eh... I'm checking the French (US) version of Pikmin 2 and... in the Exploration Kit, the Sphere Chart and the Solar System both have the same names...
2016-07-17 17:07:20	Marty2000	They are both called "Système solaire" (Solar system)
2016-07-17 17:07:26	Marty2000	I'll check the European version later
2016-07-17 17:22:46	@Espyo	woah!
2016-07-17 17:22:47	@Espyo	that's funky
2016-07-17 17:25:46	Marty2000	I wonder if this is a mistake. I will have to verify later by retrieving the treasure in-game instead of checking via the pause menu

2016-07-17 18:47:14	Marty2000	Hey Espyo, so it was a mistake indeed. When you recover the Spherical Atlas, the Ship calls the upgrade "Carte Sphérique" (Spherical card). It only calls it "Système solaire" (Solar system) in the pause menu. That's the second mistake for the French USA version :p

2016-07-17 19:14:21	Marty2000	No problem
2016-07-17 19:14:22	CraftedPbody	I just have the concept for it.
2016-07-17 19:15:39	CraftedPbody	It's basically a flintbeetle relative that acts similarly to the doodlebug, but upon running it causes fire to ignite
2016-07-17 19:16:13	Marty2000	I see. That's cool! I'll try to think of a name too
2016-07-17 19:21:54	Marty2000	I'd have some names, but they are not really like the other names you can find in the Pikmin series... do you still want to hear them?

2016-07-17 20:30:32	Scruffy	Hi Espyo
2016-07-17 20:30:43	Scruffy	Wow, that looks very professionally designed CraftedPBody
2016-07-17 20:31:02	Scruffy	And the colors work really well for suggesting height differences
2016-07-17 20:31:58	Scruffy	One suggestion I have though: do you see the part directly south of the Onions where the path splits?
2016-07-17 20:32:10	CraftedPbody	yeah?
2016-07-17 20:32:23	Scruffy	One direction is a lower space with a Dwarf Red Bulborb and the other is a higher path
2016-07-17 20:32:31	Scruffy	I would make that split a little smoother
2016-07-17 20:32:40	CraftedPbody	hm?
2016-07-17 20:32:43	Scruffy	It seems like it'd be easy for Pikmin to get stuck in that crevice
2016-07-17 20:33:16	CraftedPbody	I see
2016-07-17 20:33:38	Scruffy	Maybe just move the western wall a little farther away to widen the space
2016-07-17 20:34:30	Scruffy	It looks good, but for example it looks tricky to carry an adult Bulborb up that path
2016-07-17 20:47:59	CraftedPbody	https://i.gyazo.com/eb082b0ce6846c3e2e3b5b562a786206.png
2016-07-17 20:48:15	Scruffy	Yeah, that looks better!
2016-07-17 20:49:23	CraftedPbody	I'm using the dwarf bulborbs as placeholders for dwarf bulbears. I'm trying to learn how to work inkscape.
2016-07-17 20:49:50	Scruffy	oooh
2016-07-17 21:12:36	CraftedPbody	Espyo how do you use an info spot?
2016-07-17 21:19:11	@Espyo	you place it like normal
2016-07-17 21:19:24	CraftedPbody	yeah, but how do you make text?
2016-07-17 21:19:27	@Espyo	then select it, and on the script variables part of the area editor's panel
2016-07-17 21:19:29	@Espyo	you type:
2016-07-17 21:19:37	@Espyo	text=This is the text.
2016-07-17 21:19:51	@Espyo	there's another property
2016-07-17 21:20:03	@Espyo	that makes it either open a dialog box or just show the text on-screen
2016-07-17 21:20:05	CraftedPbody	what is the 'open box' used in the one on the play map
2016-07-17 21:20:06	@Espyo	but I forgot its name
2016-07-17 21:20:12	@Espyo	oh, that's what it is, then
2016-07-17 21:20:21	@Espyo	if opens_box is true, it opens a dialog box
2016-07-17 21:20:26	@Espyo	otherwise, shows the text instantly when you get close

2016-07-18 19:27:31	@Espyo	what irks me the most in them is all of those movement logs for threads because a user got renamed

2016-07-20 15:40:50	Yoshi2	as long as the games are not censored which they aren't, as far as I can tell
2016-07-20 15:42:07	Yoshi2	except for the cover on which some characters have a covered up belly instead of a slightly transparent one

2016-07-20 19:23:36	Yoshi2	I finished watching the LP of the 2nd game in the neptunia series, so now I can play the third game which I do have
2016-07-20 19:24:32	@Espyo	oh, the plot continues?
2016-07-20 19:30:04	Yoshi2	it never ends
2016-07-20 19:30:09	Yoshi2	there is a fourth game
2016-07-20 19:30:12	Yoshi2	and some spinoffs
2016-07-20 19:30:59	Yoshi2	something

2016-07-20 19:31:03	Yoshi2	wrooooooooong
2016-07-20 19:31:11	Yoshi2	something feels
2016-07-20 19:31:15	Yoshi2	soo wrooooooong
2016-07-20 19:31:40	Yoshi2	what happened to the English voice actors from the previous games
2016-07-20 19:32:54	 *	Yoshi2 breathes in heavily
2016-07-20 19:33:12	Yoshi2	some of them are different
2016-07-20 19:33:13	@Espyo	hah
2016-07-20 19:33:24	 *	Yoshi2 breathes in again
2016-07-20 19:33:40	Yoshi2	well, I chose this life
2016-07-20 19:33:48	Yoshi2	and now I have to deal with the consequences
2016-07-20 19:35:05	Yoshi2	at least, so far the voice actors aren't bad
2016-07-20 19:35:17	Yoshi2	I just need to hear some more of two of the characters to make a judgement
2016-07-20 19:37:44	Yoshi2	there is ONE character that sounds different from how it was in the previous games :/
2016-07-20 19:38:04	Yoshi2	much more pissed off, which the character does do sometimes, but only when changing forms, not all the time
2016-07-20 19:39:42	@Espyo	welcome to Flanderization
2016-07-20 19:41:47	Yoshi2	it shouldn't even be that way with this particular character
2016-07-20 19:43:36	Yoshi2	seems like a measure to save on voice acting costs
2016-07-20 19:47:07	Yoshi2	at least the voice acting for my favorite waifu- I mean the nep sisters has preserved their personality from the previous games
2016-07-20 19:48:19	@Espyo	don't try to act like waifus aren't laifus
2016-07-20 19:48:29	Yoshi2	no waifu no laifu
2016-07-20 19:48:35	Yoshi2	number 1 rule
2016-07-20 19:49:40	@Espyo	ye
2016-07-20 19:54:56	Yoshi2	there are 5 other characters I'm concerned about, but 2 of those will appear much later and 3 will appear later :/
2016-07-20 20:01:57	Yoshi2	oh no, the character who usually never screams suddenly screams in this game
2016-07-20 20:02:38	@Espyo	wow
2016-07-20 20:03:05	Yoshi2	it's a minor detail
2016-07-20 20:03:09	Yoshi2	but it matters
2016-07-20 20:03:52	@Espyo	like hell it's a minor detail
2016-07-20 20:04:26	Yoshi2	it's a different voice actor, I guess
2016-07-20 20:04:53	Yoshi2	the new voice actor isn't bad, but it's really something that bothers me because I played the previous games
2016-07-20 20:06:07	Yoshi2	I guess it isn't easy to retain voice actors for a longer running series
2016-07-20 20:07:30	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-20 20:07:35	Yoshi2	the alternative is using the Japanese voice acting which I tried in the first game and found it to be generic and too anime-y
2016-07-20 20:07:53	Yoshi2	so I'll keep to the English VA
2016-07-20 20:12:10	Yoshi2	they changed the equipment screen which shows the character in such a way that you won't be able to catch a glimpse of the underwear, oh joy
2016-07-20 20:12:31	Yoshi2	I shouldn't be upset about something like that but I do feel a bit upset

2016-07-20 20:13:09	Yoshi2	and i scared scruffy away
2016-07-20 20:17:29	Yoshi2	but the translation is fine, the gameplay is same as before and the voice actors try their best so I'm sure it will be fine
2016-07-20 20:17:51	@Espyo	I'd feel upset either way
2016-07-20 20:18:01	@Espyo	enabling it would be perverted
2016-07-20 20:18:05	@Espyo	removing it would be censorship
2016-07-20 20:18:18	Yoshi2	the thing about the change on the equipment screen is
2016-07-20 20:19:02	Yoshi2	in regular gameplay you literally cannot unsee the underwear because all characters have skirts so you know what happens when they bend over even slightly
2016-07-20 20:19:39	@Espyo	hah
2016-07-20 20:19:52	@Espyo	I guess in-game you have to work for it
2016-07-20 20:19:57	@Espyo	but on the equipment screen it's for free

2016-07-20 20:24:51	@Espyo	I think emoji too
2016-07-20 20:24:55	@Espyo	but your shrug has a yen instead of a \

2016-07-20 20:28:11	@Espyo	no, nothing special happens with underscores here
2016-07-20 20:28:13	Yoshi2	but the other time I used no underscore and you saw two yen

2016-07-20 20:29:25	@Espyo	there's no rhyme or reason for this
2016-07-20 20:29:28	Yoshi2	Well, no idea ¯\(ツ)/¯

2016-07-20 20:40:16	Yoshi2	sometimes I feel like I'm a sucker for liking this game series
2016-07-20 20:40:35	Yoshi2	it's just cute characters, wacky dialogue and lots of 4th wall breaking
2016-07-20 20:41:12	@Espyo	*shrug* that's perfectly fine
2016-07-20 20:41:21	@Espyo	what, are you only mean to like rugged man games, like FIFA or Counter Strike?
2016-07-20 20:41:23	@Espyo	puhlease
2016-07-20 20:42:14	Yoshi2	hehe, my mom would complain about me playing violent games, and my dad would complain about me playing cute games (mario, pikmin, ...)
2016-07-20 20:43:01	@Espyo	haha!
2016-07-20 20:44:39	Yoshi2	though I started off with edgy games like starcraft, counter strike, gta
2016-07-20 20:44:58	@Espyo	right
2016-07-20 20:45:01	@Espyo	the usual games at the time
2016-07-20 20:45:06	Yoshi2	maybe I lived out the edgy life and now I just want to see bright colors and happy characters ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-07-20 20:54:53	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-20 20:56:44	Yoshi2	on the other hand I really need to finish just cause 2 and dishonored and LIMBO and papers please
2016-07-20 21:19:07	Yoshi2	two other of my favorite characters retain their voice actor
2016-07-20 21:25:27	Yoshi2	I am scared, the other character I mentioned was screaming now suddenly sounds like in the previous games
2016-07-20 21:30:14	@Espyo	hm
2016-07-20 21:41:23	Yoshi2	there is a crafting plan called Keep the Peeping Down and the description says "A plan that lets you... Y'know... See Neptune stuff..."
2016-07-20 21:41:30	Yoshi2	:v)
2016-07-20 21:42:57	Yoshi2	in a way I am a bit suprised that the game is rated only 12+ in Germany
2016-07-20 21:59:44	@Espyo	Neptune?
2016-07-20 21:59:48	@Espyo	Neptune, Uranus?
2016-07-20 22:00:06	Yoshi2	main character is neptune
2016-07-20 22:00:39	Yoshi2	if you ever see a picture of an anime-looking character with purple hair, blue/white clothing and two d-pads on the head, that's neptune
2016-07-20 22:04:58	@Espyo	oh!
2016-07-20 22:04:59	@Espyo	I know the one
2016-07-20 22:05:11	@Espyo	my mind was like "nope" till the word "d-pads"
2016-07-20 22:05:26	@Espyo	still, Neptune's Uranus
2016-07-20 22:05:30	@Espyo	good...good stuff, that

2016-07-21 19:30:56	Yoshi2	in this game I was given the swimsuit outfit right away through some already enabled DLC, but I don't feel good about that
2016-07-21 19:32:25	@Espyo	you shouldn't
2016-07-21 19:32:46	Yoshi2	I saved before I got it, seems it is a special dlc-enabled event that gives it
2016-07-21 19:32:57	Yoshi2	I'll just not use it till later
2016-07-21 19:33:11	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-07-21 19:33:16	Yoshi2	when other characters get a similar outfit too

2016-07-21 21:53:14	@Espyo	it's not a Metroid game at ALL
2016-07-21 21:53:23	@Espyo	this is a simple sports mini-game
2016-07-21 21:53:28	@Espyo	we don't know how the main game will be yet
2016-07-21 21:53:31	@Espyo	but this thing is just a mini-game
2016-07-21 21:53:35	Marty2000	Oh, okay
2016-07-21 21:55:24	Yoshi2	when I first heard a friend talk about nintendo releasing a metroid spinoff for free today, I thought "I knew people hated federation force, but did they really hate it THAT much?"
2016-07-21 21:56:00	@Espyo	haha, yeah
2016-07-21 21:56:10	@Espyo	the only way people will have to play this game is if it's given out for free
2016-07-21 22:09:05	Yoshi2	>application crashed
2016-07-21 22:09:10	Yoshi2	are you
2016-07-21 22:09:11	Yoshi2	serious
2016-07-21 22:09:42	Yoshi2	thankfully I save all the time but still not nice
2016-07-21 22:09:49	@Espyo	ugh
2016-07-21 22:10:20	Yoshi2	well, I "only" missed a bunch of dialogue

2016-07-21 22:12:01	Yoshi2	.___________.
2016-07-21 22:12:05	Yoshi2	dropbox why
2016-07-21 22:12:18	Yoshi2	how hard can it be to not be shitty
2016-07-21 22:13:54	Yoshi2	are you kidding me
2016-07-21 22:14:00	Yoshi2	it crashed at almost the same point again
2016-07-21 22:14:27	@Espyo	ikr?
2016-07-21 22:14:33	@Espyo	it's so hard to trust services nowadays
2016-07-21 22:14:39	@Espyo	windows 10 is basically an ad machine, it seems
2016-07-21 22:14:42	@Espyo	wikia is lolwikia
2016-07-21 22:14:52	@Espyo	youtube keeps going down the hole
2016-07-21 22:15:01	@Espyo	now dropbox is doing something shady
2016-07-21 22:15:59	Yoshi2	oracle is crap, skype is crap
2016-07-21 22:16:16	Testyo	The juice fills Do they have any official artwork...? I'm searching for them
2016-07-21 22:17:45	Yoshi2	and lolversioning
2016-07-21 22:17:52	Yoshi2	4.4.29
2016-07-21 22:17:57	Yoshi2	5.4.24
2016-07-21 22:18:04	Yoshi2	6.4.14
2016-07-21 22:19:04	Yoshi2	(This is quite similar to how Chrome and Firefox operate.)
2016-07-21 22:19:20	Yoshi2	and i think the way chrome/ff do the versioning is retarded
2016-07-21 22:21:51	Yoshi2	ok, it is something with the voice files, I guess
2016-07-21 22:22:23	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-21 22:24:05	Yoshi2	goddamnit it crashes every time at this point
2016-07-21 22:24:27	Yoshi2	it works if I skip through it but I don't want to skip the dialogue that I haven't read yet :(
2016-07-21 22:25:34	@Espyo	watch youtube videos
2016-07-21 22:26:47	Yoshi2	ok, with Japanese VA it works
2016-07-21 22:32:35	Yoshi2	I am sad because this would be hilarious with the English VA
2016-07-21 22:32:58	@Espyo	youtube, still
2016-07-21 22:33:01	Yoshi2	"But I guess, if it's you... Uh, it's embarrassing, but..."
2016-07-21 22:33:41	Yoshi2	not feeling like looking it up on youtube, too risky in terms of spoilers
2016-07-21 22:35:28	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-07-21 22:35:34	@Espyo	well, you can watch it after you're completely done with this chapter
2016-07-21 22:35:38	@Espyo	or the game

2016-07-21 23:26:36	@PikFan	so, the final Splatfest is less than 12 hours away...
2016-07-21 23:26:43	Marty2000	Yep...
2016-07-21 23:27:01	@PikFan	and I still haven't chosen between Callie or Marie...
2016-07-21 23:27:09	@PikFan	I like them both, but...
2016-07-21 23:27:23	@PikFan	it's not like I can sit this one out
2016-07-21 23:27:29	@Espyo	CALLIE
2016-07-21 23:27:30	@PikFan	this is THE Splatfest
2016-07-21 23:27:38	@Espyo	Marie is a complete bitch
2016-07-21 23:27:41	@Espyo	she's so mean to Callie
2016-07-21 23:27:45	@Espyo	and Callie always offers nothing but love
2016-07-21 23:27:50	Marty2000	Espyo: I've chosen Callie on my main account
2016-07-21 23:27:53	@PikFan	that's why I like Marie
2016-07-21 23:27:56	Marty2000	Though, since I love both
2016-07-21 23:27:57	@Espyo	oh, I thought it was the other way around
2016-07-21 23:27:57	@PikFan	I like her sassiness
2016-07-21 23:28:06	Marty2000	I'll chose Marie on my second account
2016-07-21 23:28:10	@PikFan	not so much the bitchiness, yeah
2016-07-21 23:28:10	Testyo	We should clean your mouth with soap!
2016-07-21 23:28:10	@Espyo	there's a fine line between banter and malice
2016-07-21 23:28:14	Marty2000	So that I participate for both
2016-07-21 23:28:22	@Espyo	me being half Portuguese, half British, I know all about banter
2016-07-21 23:28:39	@Espyo	I just hate the map rotation
2016-07-21 23:28:39	@Espyo	so much
2016-07-21 23:28:42	@Espyo	it's a sniper's paradise
2016-07-21 23:28:50	Marty2000	Fine to me
2016-07-21 23:28:51	@Espyo	way to make the event not-fun for everybody
2016-07-21 23:29:00	@Espyo	non-snipers are going to be sniped a LOT
2016-07-21 23:29:03	@Espyo	that's not fun in the slightest
2016-07-21 23:29:12	@PikFan	blame the fans
2016-07-21 23:29:17	@Espyo	snipers are going to snipe a lot, but won't contribute many points to the team, resulting in losses
2016-07-21 23:29:18	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-21 23:29:44	@PikFan	Moray Towers? ick, I'd rather have Port Mackerel
2016-07-21 23:30:00	@PikFan	the central area in Towers is hell
2016-07-21 23:30:11	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-21 23:30:14	@PikFan	you know, I had an idea
2016-07-21 23:30:20	@PikFan	it probably won't happen, but
2016-07-21 23:30:22	@Espyo	I might be able to combat that with my Carbon Roller Deco
2016-07-21 23:30:31	@Espyo	quick enough speed to evade the shots
2016-07-21 23:30:34	@PikFan	what if they switched the stages halfway through Splatfest
2016-07-21 23:30:35	@Espyo	then counter-attacking with seekers
2016-07-21 23:30:40	Marty2000	The normal one has an Inkzooka, if it helps
2016-07-21 23:30:43	@Espyo	yeah, that won't happen
2016-07-21 23:30:48	@Espyo	hmm, good point
2016-07-21 23:30:51	@Espyo	though I really like seekers
2016-07-21 23:30:52	@Espyo	they're fun
2016-07-21 23:30:54	Marty2000	With Burst Bombs
2016-07-21 23:31:11	Marty2000	And with 3 main Bomb Range Ups, you can already reach the other side on Moray Towers
2016-07-21 23:31:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-21 23:32:03	Marty2000	I don't know if I should trade my Bubbler for an Inkzooka during the Splatfest... I'll see how it goes first
2016-07-21 23:32:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-21 23:34:55	@PikFan	lol, my friend says that she's only seen Callie be a bitch to Marie
2016-07-21 23:34:55	Testyo	You're using quite the colorful words, aren't you?
2016-07-21 23:35:08	Scruffy	Hi PikFan
2016-07-21 23:35:17	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-07-21 23:35:59	Yoshi2|offline	iirc in NA Callie is quite a bitch towards Marie
2016-07-21 23:35:59	Testyo	You swear like a sailor.
2016-07-21 23:36:29	@PikFan	oh, right
2016-07-21 23:36:35	Marty2000	Both love Bubblers (Callie : I love it when the whole team shares a Bubbler! And Marie gives a name to that technique). I hope you understand that I'm forced to choose both sides
2016-07-21 23:36:35	@PikFan	you guys have the EU versions :P
2016-07-21 23:36:42	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-07-21 23:37:15	Marty2000	Even though, on the news, when there's Walleye Warehouse, Callie says "Didn't you get trounced on this stage the other day"(something like that)?
2016-07-21 23:37:16	@Espyo	she's got the names mixed up then
2016-07-21 23:37:23	Marty2000	I think it's the same on the US version
2016-07-21 23:37:45	@Espyo	they both shoot banter at each other

2016-07-22 18:54:03	G98	Just like that?
2016-07-22 18:54:11	G98	No backup or anything?
2016-07-22 18:54:26	Yoshi2	the backup is called "other servers of this irc network", I guess
2016-07-22 18:55:46	@Espyo	yep

2016-07-22 19:01:29	Yoshi2	Espyo: remember how I complained about not being able to move the view far enough on the equipment screen
2016-07-22 19:02:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-22 19:02:41	Yoshi2	there is a thing I can enable called "Keep the Peeping down"
2016-07-22 19:03:21	@Espyo	I thought that was a mission, not an option
2016-07-22 19:03:28	Yoshi2	description: "I prepared a special character model tilt feature for each of the characters in this game. Just think of it as a touch of fanservice for those who feel so inclined. Will you use it?"
2016-07-22 19:04:34	Yoshi2	in other words, using the mouse and middle click you can tilt the model heavily enough :I
2016-07-22 19:04:44	Yoshi2	which means I have to take my earlier complaint back
2016-07-22 19:04:47	@Espyo	that is so not-subtle
2016-07-22 19:05:33	Yoshi2	quite not subtle
2016-07-22 19:09:01	@Espyo	in other news, today I learned about imgui
2016-07-22 19:09:03	@Espyo	and I fell in love
2016-07-22 19:09:09	@Espyo	it's a GUI library for C++
2016-07-22 19:09:16	@Espyo	but it's so powerful
2016-07-22 19:09:20	@Espyo	and the real zinger about it
2016-07-22 19:09:28	@Espyo	is that normally, you'd have one variable for each widget on your code
2016-07-22 19:09:36	@Espyo	you'd do initialization and property settings somewhere
2016-07-22 19:09:51	@Espyo	then elsewhere you'd handle events, check if the mouse is on top of one, if it's been clicked, a key's been typed, etc.
2016-07-22 19:09:58	@Espyo	and then somewhere else you'd draw the widgets
2016-07-22 19:10:04	@Espyo	with this library, you do it all IN A SINGLE LINE
2016-07-22 19:10:10	@Espyo	and I'm in love with its wizardry
2016-07-22 19:10:22	@Espyo	https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
2016-07-22 19:10:27	@Espyo	the widgets it has are also insanely good
2016-07-22 19:10:35	@Espyo	IT HAS HISTOGRAMS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD

2016-07-22 19:39:46	Yoshi2	Espyo: neat, how does it do layouts?
2016-07-22 19:41:48	@Espyo	apparently really well
2016-07-22 19:41:51	@Espyo	I'm not sure on the HOW
2016-07-22 19:41:55	@Espyo	neither on the programmer side or the backend side
2016-07-22 19:42:00	@Espyo	but I've seen images, and tried the demo
2016-07-22 19:42:05	@Espyo	and you've got a lot of fancy grids and tables
2016-07-22 19:47:04	Yoshi2	there has to be something that sets the layout, I do not believe in voodoo magic
2016-07-22 19:47:19	Yoshi2	the first code example looks like the default goes from top to down
2016-07-22 19:47:20	@Espyo	oh, there's probably one or two instructions you run to enter "table" mode

2016-07-23 00:10:08	Marty2000	I reached Callie King and played a little for Marie
2016-07-23 00:10:15	Marty2000	Which team did you end up choosing?
2016-07-23 00:11:22	@PikFan	Callie
2016-07-23 00:11:36	@PikFan	and then picked Marie on my alt, of course
2016-07-23 00:11:49	@PikFan	Marie's gonna win, I think
2016-07-23 00:11:53	@PikFan	but that's okay
2016-07-23 00:12:20	@PikFan	I lost my first battle in this Splatfest, though... :(
2016-07-23 00:12:35	@PikFan	it was on Moray Towers
2016-07-23 00:12:36	@PikFan	sigh
2016-07-23 00:13:44	Marty2000	Yeah, Marie is going to win
2016-07-23 00:13:52	Marty2000	Their teams are usually better
2016-07-23 00:15:45	Marty2000	I lost some battles too
2016-07-23 00:15:55	Marty2000	I recorded my matches for Team Callie
2016-07-23 00:16:05	Marty2000	I'll do the same for Team Marie
2016-07-23 00:17:54	@PikFan	wow, Splatfest power if 1935...
2016-07-23 00:18:02	@PikFan	you might just be in the Splatfest Top 100
2016-07-23 00:18:07	@PikFan	*of
2016-07-23 00:19:53	Marty2000	I'd like to, to be honest. It's not very important, but I fought fiercely for that
2016-07-23 00:19:59	Marty2000	:p
2016-07-23 00:20:31	@PikFan	I can fight all I want as hard as I want, but I won't even break 1700
2016-07-23 00:20:31	Marty2000	But if I'm not in the top 100, that wouldn't be a big problem. After all, I'm playing to have fun with Bubblers (and hear Janella now), that's all
2016-07-23 00:20:45	Marty2000	I think you need luck, honestly
2016-07-23 00:21:12	@PikFan	nope
2016-07-23 00:21:13	@PikFan	it isn't a matter of luck, it's skill

2016-07-23 00:21:21	@PikFan	but I don't think that's true
2016-07-23 00:21:26	@PikFan	you actually have to be good
2016-07-23 00:21:31	@PikFan	and then maybe you'll get lucky
2016-07-23 00:21:46	Marty2000	You can be the best player and lose if your teammates are not as good as you, according to me
2016-07-23 00:21:53	@PikFan	that is also true
2016-07-23 00:22:23	Marty2000	So, I'd say there's some luck involved because of the matchmaking
2016-07-23 00:22:28	Marty2000	But I may be wrong too
2016-07-23 00:22:39	Marty2000	Of course, you need skill as well

2016-07-23 18:26:24	Scruffy	Wow, I didn't know that video was still watched
2016-07-23 18:26:40	Scruffy	Heh, thank you for commenting on my behalf!
2016-07-23 18:27:12	@Espyo	you're welcome
2016-07-23 18:27:18	@Espyo	it's a pretty great video
2016-07-23 18:27:22	@Espyo	you HAVE to do others like it
2016-07-23 18:27:50	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-23 18:28:02	Scruffy	I wish I could explore the innards of more games
2016-07-23 18:28:47	Yoshi2	what keeps you from doing that?
2016-07-23 18:29:48	Scruffy	not having access to them
2016-07-23 18:30:13	Yoshi2	you could just
2016-07-23 18:30:19	Yoshi2	coughcoughcough
2016-07-23 18:30:35	Scruffy	I knowww
2016-07-23 18:30:38	Yoshi2	acquire them
2016-07-23 18:31:00	Scruffy	It's a personal belief that I don't acquire games I don't legally own
2016-07-23 18:31:11	@Espyo	well, you shouldn't do that anyway
2016-07-23 18:31:18	@Espyo	trying to understand the internals of a game you don't own is a bit dumb
2016-07-23 18:31:24	@Espyo	since you don't know what's normal and what's incredible
2016-07-23 18:31:31	Scruffy	Heh, true
2016-07-23 18:31:43	Scruffy	But even if I do own a game it's hard to find them
2016-07-23 18:31:49	Scruffy	For me, at least
2016-07-23 18:31:55	@Espyo	depends on the platform
2016-07-23 18:32:02	@Espyo	pre-GameCube games are pretty easy
2016-07-23 18:32:07	Yoshi2	i have absolutely no regrets about battalion wars
2016-07-23 18:32:08	Scruffy	Plus I have no idea what goes on in some games' inner files
2016-07-23 18:32:08	@Espyo	from there on out... yeah, it does get a bit tougher
2016-07-23 18:32:17	Yoshi2	I played through the series a few times before I even started modding
2016-07-23 18:32:26	@Espyo	we've been scouring Pikmin 2 for years and we're still not sure if we're seeing content or nonsense
2016-07-23 18:32:27	@Espyo	so
2016-07-23 18:32:37	Scruffy	I downloaded Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour for Dolphin, and checked the files inside
2016-07-23 18:32:50	Scruffy	It was a series of folders each named one letter of the alphabet
2016-07-23 18:33:02	Scruffy	Inside those were more folders named one letter of the alphabet
2016-07-23 18:33:11	Scruffy	And in those files named one letter of the alphabet
2016-07-23 18:33:40	@Espyo	what in the world
2016-07-23 18:33:51	@Espyo	and I thought the Pikmin 2 devs were nuts
2016-07-23 18:34:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: what is dumb is trying to understand the internals of a game you haven't played much
2016-07-23 18:34:50	Yoshi2	whether you own it or not is secondary
2016-07-23 18:34:59	@Espyo	guess so
2016-07-23 18:35:04	Scruffy	That's true
2016-07-23 18:37:15	Scruffy	Well anyway, I do still have the video on interesting Pikmin 2 sound files in the works, I just haven't completed it because I keep forgetting about it
2016-07-23 18:37:26	Scruffy	And I don't have an environment to record at the moment
2016-07-23 18:37:43	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-07-23 18:37:52	Scruffy	Speaking of which, I found out there are quite a few foley sounds that Nintendo continues to use throughout its games
2016-07-23 18:38:01	Scruffy	Common foley sounds, that is
2016-07-23 18:38:25	Scruffy	There's a sound in Donkey Kong Jungle Beat that resurfaces in the files of Super Mario 3D World
2016-07-23 18:38:30	@Espyo	I bet there are quite a few, yeah

2016-07-23 20:24:15	Scruffy	I did not

2016-07-23 20:31:45	En_Passant	Hi
2016-07-23 20:31:51	En_Passant	My computer seems to be having problems with RAM recently
2016-07-23 20:31:53	Marty2000	I saw the trailers of the new games today
2016-07-23 20:32:06	En_Passant	I'm not loading anything I wasn't before
2016-07-23 20:37:01	Scruffy	...well now I have
2016-07-23 20:39:46	Scruffy	Sonic Mania seems pretty interesting
2016-07-23 20:40:18	En_Passant	I don't know why they're including Classic Sonic in the new game on top of that
2016-07-23 20:40:49	Scruffy	I guess he's just a canonical character now
2016-07-23 20:41:53	Scruffy	On top of that, the new game kind of made me realize that no matter how detailed they make Sonic's model and render, it doesn't look like it belongs in a fully realized apocalypse scene
2016-07-23 20:42:12	En_Passant	Yeah...
2016-07-23 20:42:33	Scruffy	Same with the robots in the same trailer: the Sonic material is rounded and cartoony, while the landscape looks more tangible
2016-07-23 20:42:36	En_Passant	I like how they realized that it was getting too goofy, but I think this is a bit of an overcorrection
2016-07-23 20:42:49	Scruffy	yeah
2016-07-23 20:43:09	En_Passant	SA2 was a good level of dark/edgy
2016-07-23 20:43:13	Scruffy	At any rate, it ought to have good music
2016-07-23 20:43:18	Scruffy	SEGA is good at that

2016-07-23 22:27:48	@PikFan	hi
2016-07-23 22:27:50	@PikFan	again :P
2016-07-23 22:28:01	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-07-23 22:28:26	@PikFan	something DID happen at the halfway point: the music changed
2016-07-23 22:28:34	@PikFan	so I guess I wasn't entirely wrong
2016-07-23 22:31:07	@PikFan	how has Splatfest been going for you so far?
2016-07-23 22:31:39	@Espyo	I finished it within 4 hours
2016-07-23 22:33:24	@PikFan	so have you been playing any more battles after that?
2016-07-23 22:39:30	@Espyo	none
2016-07-23 22:39:36	@Espyo	sure, it's the last one
2016-07-23 22:39:50	@PikFan	:|
2016-07-23 22:39:52	@PikFan	:|
2016-07-23 22:39:55	@PikFan	:|
2016-07-23 22:40:08	@PikFan	play more just for the heck of it
2016-07-23 22:40:14	@Espyo	but I can't handle people outranging me with short-range weapons, having the clairvoyance to see me behind walls, and sniping me without aiming at me or without needing a charging period
2016-07-23 22:40:17	@Espyo	playing Smash
2016-07-23 22:40:21	@Espyo	practicing for a tourney tomorrow
2016-07-23 22:40:38	@PikFan	<A<
2016-07-23 22:41:07	@PikFan	did you only play Splatfest to reach the royalty title?
2016-07-23 22:43:24	@Espyo	pretty much
2016-07-23 22:43:33	@Espyo	I think I'm gonna stop playing Splatoon
2016-07-23 22:43:33	@PikFan	what's the fun in that
2016-07-23 22:43:37	@Espyo	or if not, I'll play it a lot less
2016-07-23 22:43:42	@Espyo	I'm sick and tired of lag ruining everything
2016-07-23 22:43:50	@PikFan	hm...
2016-07-23 22:43:51	@Espyo	and horrible weapon balance
2016-07-23 22:43:57	@Espyo	every single time I play Splatoon, I don't have fun
2016-07-23 22:43:58	@Espyo	like
2016-07-23 22:43:59	@Espyo	seriously
2016-07-23 22:44:09	@PikFan	ouch
2016-07-23 22:44:17	@Espyo	it's so poorly optimized
2016-07-23 22:44:17	@PikFan	how often do you lag
2016-07-23 22:44:23	@Espyo	*I* don't
2016-07-23 22:44:35	@PikFan	*how often does the game lag
2016-07-23 22:44:41	@Espyo	when DOESN'T it?
2016-07-23 22:44:52	@Espyo	getting simultaneous kills is something that happens every time
2016-07-23 22:44:56	@Espyo	on a perfect connection this wouldn't happen
2016-07-23 22:44:59	@Espyo	sure, you can't get perfect
2016-07-23 22:45:11	@Espyo	but you also can't get a CONSTANT simultaneous kill with "okay" connection
2016-07-23 22:45:15	@Espyo	my connection's good
2016-07-23 22:45:19	@Espyo	everybody else's, not so much
2016-07-23 22:45:23	@PikFan	I thought you had bad internet
2016-07-23 22:45:28	@Espyo	nope, mine's decent
2016-07-23 22:45:33	@PikFan	huh
2016-07-23 22:45:40	@Espyo	(it does completely disconnect every once in a while, I still need to crack skulls over that)
2016-07-23 22:45:46	@Espyo	this could be fixed if the game didn't listen to the attacker to determine who dies
2016-07-23 22:45:59	@Espyo	because if the attacker is lagging, on their screen, you show up stopped in plac
2016-07-23 22:46:01	@Espyo	*place
2016-07-23 22:46:03	@Espyo	meaning you're an easy target
2016-07-23 22:46:08	@Espyo	and then the game just syncs, and says you die
2016-07-23 22:46:21	@Espyo	although on your screen, you were a ninja with perfect reflexes and avoidance
2016-07-23 22:46:28	@Espyo	the game punishes you for being good in so many ways
2016-07-23 22:46:32	@Espyo	and dying is a very big bother in this game
2016-07-23 22:46:38	@Espyo	I hate spending 30% of my time on the respawn screen
2016-07-23 22:46:42	@Espyo	and all because the game is poorly mad
2016-07-23 22:46:43	@Espyo	*made
2016-07-23 22:46:44	@Espyo	not really fun
2016-07-23 22:46:46	@Espyo	so, I won't play
2016-07-23 22:46:58	@PikFan	has it always been like this, since day 1?
2016-07-23 22:50:17	@Espyo	that's just it
2016-07-23 22:50:22	@Espyo	no, it was fine in the early days
2016-07-23 22:50:29	@Espyo	but this might be because everybody was still new to the game
2016-07-23 22:50:31	@Espyo	so the action was very slow
2016-07-23 22:50:38	@Espyo	which gave the game more than enough time to calculate stuff fairly
2016-07-23 22:50:51	@Espyo	people trying to shoot each other were so bad, that only one shot per second connected
2016-07-23 22:50:59	@Espyo	easy to calculate damage then
2016-07-23 22:51:11	@Espyo	but today, if people shoot three shots on their screen, but on your screen, you only got two
2016-07-23 22:51:30	@Espyo	by the time the game gives your screen an update to do the second shot, it already sent you the update to say "you should die"
2016-07-23 22:51:39	@Espyo	so you die without technically having been shot enough
2016-07-23 22:51:51	@Espyo	Splatoon can be fun, for sure
2016-07-23 22:51:56	@Espyo	the hiding mechanic is great
2016-07-23 22:52:00	@Espyo	and it has so many possibilities
2016-07-23 22:52:06	@Espyo	ink a wall, and sneak up somebody that passes by
2016-07-23 22:52:17	@Espyo	ink some random sploshes and hide in one, and then strike when somebody appears
2016-07-23 22:52:26	@Espyo	ink the terrain in front of somebody performing a jump so they slow down and fail the jump
2016-07-23 22:52:30	@Espyo	but those scenarios are rare
2016-07-23 22:52:39	@Espyo	the vast majority of the game is just
2016-07-23 22:52:47	@Espyo	 5% inking the base, almost exactly the same way as every time
2016-07-23 22:52:53	@Espyo	 5% those fun ink shenanigans
2016-07-23 22:53:06	@Espyo	 5% inking the turf, which is fun
2016-07-23 22:53:10	@Espyo	 85% battling and losing
2016-07-23 22:53:33	@PikFan	hmm
2016-07-23 22:53:41	@PikFan	oh, I saw that you got up to S
2016-07-23 22:53:43	@PikFan	nice work
2016-07-23 23:01:15	@Espyo	thanks
2016-07-23 23:01:21	@Espyo	yeah, ranked actually doesn't work so bad
2016-07-23 23:01:24	@Espyo	I guess I'm focusing more
2016-07-23 23:01:28	@PikFan	heh
2016-07-23 23:01:46	@PikFan	aside from all the connection problems, I'm guessing?
2016-07-23 23:01:56	@Espyo	and (mostly) only skilled people play it
2016-07-23 23:02:02	@Espyo	so you're not gonna find teammates that ignore you
2016-07-23 23:02:13	@Espyo	yeah, the problems I mentioned before still exist on ranked
2016-07-23 23:02:16	@Espyo	but I guess they're SLIGHTLY weaker
2016-07-23 23:02:21	@Espyo	still, not enough for me to keep playing
2016-07-23 23:02:25	@Espyo	I'll still keep the game
2016-07-23 23:02:30	@Espyo	heck, can't sell it anyway, it's digital
2016-07-23 23:03:47	@PikFan	hopefully NX and Splat2n won't have horrid connection issues
2016-07-23 23:03:53	@PikFan	but knowing Nintendo, they will
2016-07-23 23:03:54	@PikFan	sigh
2016-07-23 23:04:13	@PikFan	I've heard many people complain about Pokemon Go's server issues
2016-07-23 23:07:04	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-23 23:07:07	@Espyo	they're so bad at online
2016-07-23 23:09:14	@PikFan	have you ever played online matches in Smash?

2016-07-23 23:10:30	@Espyo	so, yeah :P
2016-07-23 23:10:39	@Espyo	there are no lag issues on Smash whatsoever
2016-07-23 23:10:42	@Espyo	there is input delay
2016-07-23 23:10:46	@Espyo	but it's not enough to be noticeable
2016-07-23 23:10:49	@Espyo	well, with friends, at least
2016-07-23 23:10:53	@Espyo	I rarely play For Glory

2016-07-25 12:53:31	Yoshi2	pikfan was rude today
2016-07-25 12:53:36	Yoshi2	but you probably saw that already
2016-07-25 12:53:59	Marty2000	Oh... Saying "Hi" and "Bye"?
2016-07-25 12:54:02	Marty2000	He had to go
2016-07-25 12:54:32	Marty2000	So you can't really say it's rudeness, compared to UltraMario
2016-07-25 12:54:41	Marty2000	If it were UltraMario, that would have been rude...
2016-07-25 12:54:56	Marty2000	:p
2016-07-25 12:55:34	Yoshi2	what is rude is not saying hi and bye
2016-07-25 12:55:43	Yoshi2	but coming on, saying hi
2016-07-25 12:55:48	Yoshi2	and 3 minutes later saying bye
2016-07-25 12:56:01	Yoshi2	why the FUCK do you even come on if you only have 3 minutes
2016-07-25 12:56:06	Marty2000	I see.
2016-07-25 12:56:11	Marty2000	He didn't know he'd have to go.
2016-07-25 12:56:23	Marty2000	(I was talking with him somewhere else).
2016-07-25 12:56:33	Yoshi2	no excuses
2016-07-25 12:56:40	Marty2000	Okay, okay :p
2016-07-25 12:57:25	Marty2000	Speaking of rudeness, UltraMario took op from 3D Player just because he said something on Mega Man games
2016-07-25 12:57:40	Marty2000	UltraMario, how can you sleep with such rudeness?
2016-07-25 12:58:22	Yoshi2	if it's 3d player, it's ok
2016-07-25 12:58:35	Marty2000	Yeah :p but it's still rude
2016-07-25 12:58:49	Yoshi2	[22:20:44] <Yoshi2> he's "Unpopular Opionion: The Person"
2016-07-25 12:58:49	Yoshi2	[22:21:23] <Yoshi2> every single thing he says will be either full of holes, lacking any explanation or just plain "why would you even say that"

2016-07-25 12:59:12	Marty2000	I see

2016-07-25 18:59:44	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2016-07-25 19:00:05	Yoshi2	Espyo: ok, so how do I actually use imgui
2016-07-25 19:00:52	@Espyo	...iunno
2016-07-25 19:00:58	@Espyo	I just compiled the example they had for Allegro
2016-07-25 19:01:00	@Espyo	and it just worked
2016-07-25 19:01:10	@Espyo	basically, it looks like it's its own thing and all
2016-07-25 19:01:16	@Espyo	and you're meant to call a bunch of commands to boot it up
2016-07-25 19:01:22	@Espyo	then some commands to tell it how to handle events
2016-07-25 19:01:30	@Espyo	some commands to tell it how to do drawing on the screen
2016-07-25 19:01:31	@Espyo	etc.
2016-07-25 19:01:56	@Espyo	but there are some wrappers bundled in
2016-07-25 19:02:06	@Espyo	so instead of doing a bunch of lines to teach imgui how to render
2016-07-25 19:02:12	@Espyo	you just call the pre-made function on the wrapper
2016-07-25 19:02:57	@Espyo	so, in the case of Allegro, looks like all I need to do is create my program as usual, then run one function on the wrapper to initialize, one to create a new frame widget, one to render to the screen, and a fourth one I'm not sure of
2016-07-25 19:03:08	@Espyo	and everything else is the usual ImGui::Button() and such
2016-07-25 19:03:17	@Espyo	to be honest, I haven't really played with it yet
2016-07-25 19:03:21	@Espyo	I'll play with it when I actually need it
2016-07-25 19:08:09	Yoshi2	i am not sure how to compile it with mingw

2016-07-25 19:11:17	@Espyo	well, the bundled examples are kinda simple
2016-07-25 19:11:29	@Espyo	they have one frame, two buttons, and a text widget to show the average CPU time
2016-07-25 19:11:37	@Espyo	it's just that one of the buttons calls the demo windows
2016-07-25 19:11:39	@Espyo	*demo window
2016-07-25 19:11:46	Yoshi2	not in terms of libs they need
2016-07-25 19:11:47	@Espyo	which itself is like 9000 lines long
2016-07-25 19:11:53	@Espyo	huh? that can't be right
2016-07-25 19:11:58	@Espyo	it barely needs any libs
2016-07-25 19:12:06	Yoshi2	directx, opengl, vulkan
2016-07-25 19:12:17	@Espyo	oh, the libs that the examples need
2016-07-25 19:12:23	@Espyo	I guess they just assume you know what you're doing

2016-07-25 19:14:22	Yoshi2	give me a simple example that proves the lib runs on my platform /o\
2016-07-25 19:14:36	@Espyo	start with an OpenGL tutorial first

2016-07-25 19:17:55	Yoshi2	I guess the joke here that is VERY easy to miss is
2016-07-25 19:18:09	Yoshi2	imgui does not do any rendering by itself
2016-07-25 19:20:21	Yoshi2	so there are no imgui-only examples
2016-07-25 19:21:52	Yoshi2	ok let's see if I can hack the opengl example into something that works
2016-07-25 19:22:07	Yoshi2	one issue I see is #include <imgui.h>
2016-07-25 19:22:24	Yoshi2	which probably means it will try to look for imgui in the installed libs but not find it
2016-07-25 19:23:48	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-25 19:25:09	Yoshi2	I am upset that this is mingw-unfriendly but at the moment I do not feel like bringing back my linux VM, install cygwin or do programming on my desktop
2016-07-25 19:25:58	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-25 19:26:01	@Espyo	but
2016-07-25 19:26:06	@Espyo	I think there are MSVC examples there
2016-07-25 19:26:59	Yoshi2	those require visual studio
2016-07-25 19:27:20	Yoshi2	and i don't think I have to say much more than that
2016-07-25 19:27:44	Yoshi2	I wonder, is there a difference between gl3w and glfw3
2016-07-25 19:28:16	@Espyo	yeah, I figured as I typed :|
2016-07-25 19:28:22	Yoshi2	I'll just... *shrug*
2016-07-25 19:28:25	@Espyo	well, at work, our engine uses glfw
2016-07-25 19:28:39	@Espyo	uhm, we had to remove glfwGetTime because it was gone in version 3
2016-07-25 19:28:42	@Espyo	that's all I know
2016-07-25 19:31:58	Yoshi2	ok, gl3w is not the same as glfw
2016-07-25 19:32:12	Yoshi2	let's see if I can find the source code for glfw

2016-07-25 20:12:15	Yoshi2	Have anybody prepackaged GLFW with MingW so we don't have to bother? If so this should increase the number of programmers who can try experimenting with OpenGL with about a magnitude. For god's sake, its 2014, and Windows still haven't come up with a standardized package installation mechansism that just works."

2016-07-25 20:38:21	Marty2000	Hello Scruffy
2016-07-25 20:38:28	Scruffy	I just discovered that the Nintendo Special Big Band does more than just soundtrack studio recordings
2016-07-25 20:38:54	Scruffy	It's all still Nintendo music, but they have great jazz arrangements of it
2016-07-25 20:39:06	Scruffy	I'm just waiting for a Pikmin big band medley
2016-07-25 20:39:13	@Espyo	ooh, hope so
2016-07-25 20:40:15	Scruffy	Here's an example if you like big band music; the mix is a little odd at times but the arrangement is wonderful and well-performed

2016-07-25 20:50:32	Scruffy	Oh, heh, you can do it!
2016-07-25 20:50:34	@Espyo	 3 minutes, 266 rhythm-perfect inputs
2016-07-25 20:50:48	@Espyo	I've been trying for over 6 hours combined
2016-07-25 20:50:50	@Espyo	I know I can do it
2016-07-25 20:50:57	Marty2000	Good luck, heh
2016-07-25 20:51:00	@Espyo	but some mini-games in it are just extreme
2016-07-25 20:51:14	@Espyo	there's this one that uses a rhythm that's not in 4/4 or 3/4
2016-07-25 20:51:18	Yoshi2	that reminds me, I should play miku project mirai agai-oh wait, I can't
2016-07-25 20:51:20	Scruffy	I do that with my iPod and tapping on things all the time
2016-07-25 20:51:27	@Espyo	and it goes by so quickly, and the inputs you have to do have to land on the weird timing the rhythm follows
2016-07-25 20:51:29	Yoshi2	my sis took the only still working 3ds on vacation
2016-07-25 20:51:33	@Espyo	you'd probably know more about it than I would
2016-07-25 20:51:43	@Espyo	I saw an explanation video one guy made, and it cleared up a LOT about how that mini-game works
2016-07-25 20:51:47	@Espyo	...but it's still just as hard
2016-07-25 20:51:51	Scruffy	if I heard the rhythm I could probably tell you the meter
2016-07-25 20:52:09	@Espyo	one sec

2016-07-25 20:52:51	@Espyo	the player controls the guy on the right, and simply has to press A after the girl says her line
2016-07-25 20:53:02	@Espyo	thing is, she says her line on-beat, and you have to say yours on-beat
2016-07-25 20:53:19	@Espyo	but since it's a weird rhythm, the durations of both lines aren't exactly the same
2016-07-25 20:53:27	@Espyo	and you can't blindly follow the "one two three four" in your head
2016-07-25 20:53:56	Scruffy	That's 4/4

2016-07-25 20:54:13	@Espyo	but the inptus aren't sorted in 4/4 time
2016-07-25 20:54:16	@Espyo	*inputs
2016-07-25 20:54:53	Scruffy	Right
2016-07-25 20:55:03	Scruffy	Each gesture is five eighth notes long
2016-07-25 20:55:20	Scruffy	That is, it lasts five eighth notes
2016-07-25 20:55:40	@Espyo	see, that's where it all falls flat
2016-07-25 20:55:45	@Espyo	that's FAR too complex for the average Joe
2016-07-25 20:55:48	Scruffy	So over a rhythm of 4/4, you're expected to count in fives
2016-07-25 20:55:51	Scruffy	right
2016-07-25 20:56:24	Scruffy	What will make it easier is to consider the entire beat in eighth notes
2016-07-25 20:56:42	@Espyo	I guess so, but going about doing that is another issue
2016-07-25 20:56:50	Scruffy	My bad, sixteenth notes
2016-07-25 20:56:52	Scruffy	Right
2016-07-25 20:56:55	@Espyo	if I'm not really used to partitioning notes like that, it won't help
2016-07-25 20:57:06	@Espyo	plus, a sixteenth note, at the song's speed, is a few milliseconds long
2016-07-25 20:57:18	Scruffy	Well the first step to it actually isn't partitioning notes
2016-07-25 20:58:16	Scruffy	Do you know the tempo of the final level? Or is the video you sent me the final tempo?
2016-07-25 20:58:45	@Espyo	it's a bit faster than what's on that video
2016-07-25 20:58:57	Scruffy	Okay
2016-07-25 20:59:00	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKvgZI1CJq0
2016-07-25 20:59:35	@Espyo	http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm judging from this, 167 BPM
2016-07-25 21:00:20	Scruffy	So if you just take 167 BPM, the beat of the song, and divide it by four,
2016-07-25 21:00:53	Scruffy	You'll find that every note played starts on a sixteenth note somewhere
2016-07-25 21:00:55	@Espyo	(Love Rap happens at 2:23 on that Remix 10 video)
2016-07-25 21:01:51	Scruffy	Then it's a matter of hearing how many sixteenth notes a phrase lasts, and beginning your phrase the sixteenth note after
2016-07-25 21:01:59	Scruffy	All about you is 5 sixteenth notes
2016-07-25 21:02:03	@Espyo	right
2016-07-25 21:02:07	Scruffy	Fo' sho' is 3 sixteenth notes
2016-07-25 21:02:28	Scruffy	Into you is 4 sixteenth notes
2016-07-25 21:02:53	@Espyo	into you is always perfectly on-beat with 4/4
2016-07-25 21:02:58	Scruffy	Yep
2016-07-25 21:02:58	@Espyo	so the math adds up
2016-07-25 21:03:10	@Espyo	hmm... I never tried quite like that
2016-07-25 21:03:27	Scruffy	But it's also all swung, so sometimes syllables like "to" in "Into you" are delayed
2016-07-25 21:03:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-25 21:03:34	Scruffy	This is common in rap
2016-07-25 21:03:40	@Espyo	as if counting in sixteenth notes wasn't hard enough...
2016-07-25 21:03:59	@Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2016-07-25 21:04:01	Scruffy	Then it sort of gets out of strictly counting and more into feeling it
2016-07-25 21:04:04	@Espyo	I think I might know how to tackle it
2016-07-25 21:04:14	@Espyo	"crazy into you"
2016-07-25 21:04:16	Scruffy	I have to consider this all the time when soloing on piano

2016-07-25 21:08:12	@Espyo	of course, the point isn't to count out loud
2016-07-25 21:08:20	Scruffy	It helps out though
2016-07-25 21:08:32	@Espyo	(except for some mini-games where they almost silence the music, and you count out loud 1, 2, 3, FOUR! to keep track)
2016-07-25 21:08:38	Scruffy	I count out loud to get through tough rhythms

2016-07-25 21:08:56	@Espyo	yeah, I can imagine counting being really common
2016-07-25 21:09:03	@Espyo	but this is way too fast to even say out loud
2016-07-25 21:09:07	@Espyo	much less follow it through with what's happening
2016-07-25 21:09:11	Scruffy	The method normally used for sixteenth notes is "one-ee-and-a-two-ee-and-a-three-ee-and-a-four-ee-and-a"
2016-07-25 21:09:22	Scruffy	That's easy to say quickly
2016-07-25 21:09:39	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-07-25 21:09:50	Scruffy	one two three and four are on the large beats
2016-07-25 21:09:58	@Espyo	one-and-two-and-three-and-four are good for half notes
2016-07-25 21:10:09	@Espyo	one-and-a-two-and-a-three-and-a-four are good for...
2016-07-25 21:10:14	@Espyo	uhm, I'd have to do the math
2016-07-25 21:10:14	Scruffy	triplets
2016-07-25 21:10:17	@Espyo	those!
2016-07-25 21:10:45	Scruffy	There are no triplets in this game though

2016-07-25 21:11:17	@Espyo	ok, I'll try getting the hang of one-ee-and-a out loud
2016-07-25 21:11:27	Scruffy	ACtually I take that back, triplets show up in rap
2016-07-25 21:11:32	@Espyo	since I never really heard that mnemonic
2016-07-25 21:11:41	Scruffy	But as a contrast to usual lyric rhythms
2016-07-25 21:11:42	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-25 21:11:53	Scruffy	That's the unspoken official one of music
2016-07-25 21:12:10	@Espyo	guess that's what makes it so "edgy"
2016-07-25 21:12:13	@Espyo	it goes against the norms

2016-07-25 21:12:54	@Espyo	seems to be working fine, counting out loud
2016-07-25 21:13:02	@Espyo	but those were the simple, on-steady-beat, "into you"
2016-07-25 21:14:24	Scruffy	Right, and in this game counting out the regular beat is not exactly as important
2016-07-25 21:14:39	Scruffy	Since it's the singer who gives you the cue
2016-07-25 21:14:54	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-25 21:15:03	@Espyo	I think I'm getting the hang of it

2016-07-25 21:15:31	Scruffy	You don't have to count one two three four actually
2016-07-25 21:15:42	Scruffy	you could just continue with one-ee-and-a-one-ee-and-a
2016-07-25 21:15:51	Scruffy	Just to subdivide the beat, not to count
2016-07-25 21:16:35	Scruffy	I wouldn't recommend that in a normal performance setting, but here is a good exception
2016-07-25 21:17:09	@Espyo	hmm, if I count in "tcks" of my tongue, I can see that fo' sho is indeed 3 for her, 2 for us
2016-07-25 21:17:22	@Espyo	yeah, you're completely right
2016-07-25 21:18:17	Scruffy	brb
2016-07-25 21:20:17	Scruffy	I have to go actually
2016-07-25 21:20:21	@Espyo	aww
2016-07-25 21:20:22	Scruffy	Sorry
2016-07-25 21:20:24	@Espyo	well, thanks for the help
2016-07-25 21:20:25	Scruffy	But I hope that helps
2016-07-25 21:20:30	Scruffy	Sure, anytime!
2016-07-25 21:20:32	@Espyo	I'll try to see if it at least helps my mind get in the right mindset
2016-07-25 21:20:36	@Espyo	instead of "just guess it"
2016-07-25 21:20:39	@Espyo	see ya!

2016-07-25 23:52:59	Scruffy	Hi Espyo, how did Remix 10 go?
2016-07-25 23:53:12	@Espyo	not so great
2016-07-25 23:53:17	@Espyo	it is mostly Love Rap that gets me
2016-07-25 23:53:30	@Espyo	when I do manage to pass Love Rap, which is like 1 out of every 6 times, I end up losing elsewhere
2016-07-25 23:53:35	@Espyo	normally because I'm just so nervous
2016-07-25 23:53:39	@Espyo	oh well
2016-07-25 23:53:41	@Espyo	I'll keep trying
2016-07-25 23:53:52	@Espyo	but look, remember me linking to a video of somebody explaining how Love Rap works?
2016-07-25 23:53:57	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-25 23:54:05	@Espyo	they say that the you should divide into 12th notes
2016-07-25 23:54:26	@Espyo	and every other note is merged
2016-07-25 23:54:31	Scruffy	Ah, that's probably because it's swung
2016-07-25 23:54:35	@Espyo	(kinda tricky to explain when you don't have the background)
2016-07-25 23:54:37	@Espyo	yeah, swing notes
2016-07-25 23:55:06	Scruffy	I suppose... but if I were performing in the song, I would count with sixteenth notes
2016-07-25 23:55:14	@Espyo	right
2016-07-25 23:55:19	@Espyo	it's hard to tell which of you two is right
2016-07-25 23:55:22	@Espyo	but one thing's for certain
2016-07-25 23:55:23	Scruffy	Heh
2016-07-25 23:55:32	@Espyo	it's too small a measurement to be able to follow along in-game and do it on-rhythm
2016-07-25 23:55:46	@Espyo	all other mini-games have your inputs be on-beat, or on the down beat
2016-07-25 23:55:50	Scruffy	Right, there's too little preparation
2016-07-25 23:55:56	@Espyo	you never have to divide more than that
2016-07-25 23:56:12	@Espyo	but then Love Rap comes along, and sheesh
2016-07-25 23:56:18	@Espyo	actually, I lie
2016-07-25 23:56:21	@Espyo	Tap Troupe
2016-07-25 23:56:31	@Espyo	that one also uses some really insane rhythm
2016-07-25 23:56:35	@Espyo	but that one's pretty easy to get
2016-07-25 23:56:39	Scruffy	It's like jazz drummers, they love to mess with you by playing gestures in 5 during a song in 4/4
2016-07-25 23:56:45	@Espyo	you go in 4/4, and then you get a cue, and swap to eighth notes
2016-07-25 23:56:54	@Espyo	and then have to time it correctly to go back into the 4/4 rhythm
2016-07-25 23:57:03	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-07-25 23:57:19	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peLHVzYFh9w
2016-07-25 23:57:28	@Espyo	but Tap Troupe manages to be so SO much easier than Love Rap...
2016-07-25 23:57:42	@Espyo	but yeah, other than those two, all mini-games are either button presses on-beat, or between two beats
2016-07-25 23:57:45	@Espyo	never more complicated than that
2016-07-25 23:57:52	@Espyo	so it feels unfair, in a way
2016-07-25 23:58:02	@Espyo	Love Rap's rhythm is perfectly legitimate, and a real challenge
2016-07-25 23:58:07	@Espyo	but eesh...
2016-07-25 23:58:37	Scruffy	It all falls into 16 though
2016-07-25 23:58:58	Scruffy	Every hit can be placed somewhere on a map of 16 notes per measure
2016-07-25 23:59:37	Scruffy	I'd like to see a Rhythm Heaven that tackles some quintuplets, or polyrhythms
2016-07-25 23:59:37	@Espyo	yeah, but none of the mini-games require that
2016-07-25 23:59:43	Scruffy	That'd be really helpful
2016-07-25 23:59:51	@Espyo	oh, the GBA one tackles polyrhythm
2016-07-25 23:59:58	@Espyo	I never played it, only saw videos
2016-07-26 00:00:04	@Espyo	it seems pretty fun and challenging
2016-07-26 00:00:09	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-26 00:00:32	Scruffy	You should try percussion some time, if you can come by an instrument
2016-07-26 00:00:44	Scruffy	If you like Rhythm Heaven then it's really fun
2016-07-26 00:00:51	@Espyo	hm, some games actually DO require you to hit, say, a 16th note later than normal
2016-07-26 00:01:01	@Espyo	so the concept's not entirely alien by Rhythm Heaven players
2016-07-26 00:01:10	@Espyo	but it's still pretty hard when you have to consciously try to get it
2016-07-26 00:01:13	@Espyo	and yeah, I think I should
2016-07-26 00:01:28	@Espyo	it requires rhythm, but dexterity too
2016-07-26 00:01:30	@Espyo	it's a bit scary...
2016-07-26 00:01:34	@Espyo	but I'm sure it'd be fun to try
2016-07-26 00:01:38	@Espyo	I'd love to stay and talk
2016-07-26 00:01:45	@Espyo	(and hopefully try to find some light at the end of the Love Rap tunnel)
2016-07-26 00:01:48	@Espyo	but it's getting late

2016-07-26 13:21:05	Deku	Oh and for the record, Pikmin 2 is my favourite Pikmin game
2016-07-26 13:22:51	Yoshi2	history is pretty cool
2016-07-26 13:23:29	Yoshi2	pikmin 3 is the first one I played and finished, so that's my favorite for the moment
2016-07-26 13:23:37	Yoshi2	I started pikmin 2 but haven't finished it yet
2016-07-26 13:25:02	Deku	Oh right! I took a massive break in my Pikmin 2 playthrough, but I just adored the dungeons, which Pikmin 3 sadly didn't have
2016-07-26 13:25:08	Deku	But 3 is still fantastic!
2016-07-26 13:25:18	Deku	Ever played the first one? it's short but sweet
2016-07-26 13:26:10	Yoshi2	haven't played the first one yet
2016-07-26 13:29:27	Yoshi2	I love the missions in the third game
2016-07-26 13:29:50	Yoshi2	feels great to try and figure out a way to optimize the playthrough in such a way that you get the best medal
2016-07-26 13:30:51	Deku	Oh certainly!! I'll never forget how happy I was when I got a platinum in the Christmas DLC you could get for free

2016-07-26 18:54:59	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-26 18:58:47	Yoshi2	i had the fun of explaining to somebody what bdsm means
2016-07-26 18:59:39	@Espyo	hah
2016-07-26 18:59:43	@Espyo	please let it be somebody from family
2016-07-26 19:02:39	Yoshi2	that would be quite fun but nope, it was somebody from irc
2016-07-26 19:02:43	Yoshi2	marty can confirm it
2016-07-26 19:02:45	@Espyo	aww
2016-07-26 19:02:47	Yoshi2	if he isn't gone again

2016-07-26 19:02:51	@Espyo	that wasn't Deku, was it?
2016-07-26 19:02:59	@Espyo	he knows what bdsm is, I'm pretty sure...
2016-07-26 19:03:10	Yoshi2	what would you do if it was him? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
2016-07-26 19:03:21	Yoshi2	but nope, it was a person in a different channel
2016-07-26 19:03:32	@Espyo	ah
2016-07-26 19:03:36	@Espyo	I'd probably go ask him "dude, wtf"

2016-07-26 19:04:32	Yoshi2	it was kinda my fault for making a bdsm reference because the person said "i want to be bashed"
2016-07-26 19:05:24	@Espyo	pfft
2016-07-26 19:06:08	Yoshi2	the person also appears to have lived a very sheltered life without any kind of humor, because a lot of stuff we say gets them cracking

2016-07-26 22:58:47	@Espyo	just not the canon, US one
2016-07-26 23:00:14	@PikFan	but you don't live in the US, so why does the US Marie bother you? :P
2016-07-26 23:00:30	Deku	He has you there
2016-07-26 23:00:42	Deku	Just focus on Portuguese Marie <3

2016-07-26 23:06:13	@Espyo	and speaking of, time to settle it once and for all
2016-07-26 23:06:23	@PikFan	Nixtrix?

2016-07-26 23:07:16	@Espyo	but it shut down some days ago
2016-07-26 23:07:18	@Espyo	and we went homeless
2016-07-26 23:07:29	@Espyo	it redirected to SynIRC from there on out, but the channel we want is already taken
2016-07-26 23:07:31	@Espyo	...more or less
2016-07-26 23:07:36	@Espyo	it's not registered, and neither are the users there
2016-07-26 23:07:44	@Espyo	but we can't really get a hold on them to ask them to leave
2016-07-26 23:07:53	@Espyo	so screw it, we'll just go elsewhere if they don't say anything in 10 minutes
2016-07-26 23:07:56	@Espyo	we've tried for 3 days now
2016-07-26 23:07:58	@Espyo	time to call it quits
2016-07-26 23:08:11	@PikFan	why can't you just use another channel?
2016-07-26 23:08:14	@Espyo	we'll come to DarkMyst and be neighbors
2016-07-26 23:08:16	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-07-26 23:08:17	@Espyo	we could
2016-07-26 23:08:30	@Espyo	but since we can't be on the old network, and we have to go to a different network
2016-07-26 23:08:33	@Espyo	might as well be here
2016-07-26 23:08:39	@PikFan	I see
2016-07-26 23:08:53	@PikFan	so did you make the channel here, then?
2016-07-26 23:09:46	@Espyo	aaaaand
2016-07-26 23:09:48	@Espyo	an admin replied

2016-07-26 23:10:10	@Espyo	they couldn't get a hold of the OP either
2016-07-26 23:10:18	@Espyo	so we're moving
2016-07-26 23:10:21	@PikFan	just now?
2016-07-26 23:10:24	@Espyo	mhm
2016-07-26 23:10:27	@PikFan	oh
2016-07-26 23:10:28	@Espyo	yeah, we could stay there, and use a different channel name
2016-07-26 23:10:32	@Espyo	but hey, it's tradition

2016-07-26 23:11:07	@PikFan	yeaaaaaah
2016-07-26 23:11:16	@Espyo	like I said, since we have to go to a different network anyway
2016-07-26 23:11:18	@Espyo	might as well be neighbors
2016-07-26 23:11:21	@PikFan	hm
2016-07-26 23:11:22	@Espyo	that's one less network for me
2016-07-26 23:11:31	@Espyo	and more convenient for them to join this channel when you guys want to talk Splatoon
2016-07-26 23:11:32	@PikFan	well, can't argue with that
2016-07-26 23:12:12	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-07-26 23:12:31	@PikFan	so why hasn't Testyo been brought back? have you just been forgetting with all of this going on?
2016-07-26 23:12:47	Scruffy	"No successor, direct or spiritual, has existed since the shutdown of the site"
2016-07-26 23:13:01	Scruffy	What would define a spiritual successor that is not a direct successor?
2016-07-26 23:13:25	@Espyo	I guess a spiritual successor would be a site not made by the same people
2016-07-26 23:13:31	@Espyo	whereas a direct successor would
2016-07-26 23:13:36	Scruffy	I guess so
2016-07-26 23:14:01	Scruffy	It's an interesting word choice

2016-07-26 23:22:23	Nikki89	but i haven't seen you much lately
2016-07-26 23:22:34	Nikki89	so i have*
2016-07-26 23:23:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-26 23:23:12	@Espyo	I pretty much stopped playing, I'm afraid
2016-07-26 23:23:19	@Espyo	online, the game is so laggy and weird
2016-07-26 23:23:21	@Espyo	it's rarely fun
2016-07-26 23:23:29	@Espyo	I'm doing more private matches now than public
2016-07-26 23:23:36	Nikki89	do you play with others everytime or by yourself with random?
2016-07-26 23:23:44	Nikki89	Oh
2016-07-26 23:24:03	Nikki89	well espyo i hold private matches quite often if you'd like to join us in them
2016-07-26 23:24:53	@Espyo	I'd like that
2016-07-26 23:24:57	@Espyo	I'm not always available
2016-07-26 23:25:05	@Espyo	but if I am, I think I'd join
2016-07-26 23:26:19	Nikki89	jake and marty are in our skype chatroom if you like to join us there, that way you can be in calls and such. I'm trying to get use to discord as well. Either would be fine if you'd like to join
2016-07-26 23:27:02	Nikki89	this one is for the discord
2016-07-26 23:27:03	@Espyo	thanks, but I just can't do skype any more

2016-07-26 23:27:17	@Espyo	I got rid of it since I never needed it any more
2016-07-26 23:27:24	Nikki89	oh
2016-07-26 23:27:25	Nikki89	xD
2016-07-26 23:27:32	@Espyo	my Discord networks are also starting to clog up
2016-07-26 23:27:34	Nikki89	well shoot cause i have like 8 people in that group already
2016-07-26 23:27:37	@Espyo	so don't take offence if I don't join :/
2016-07-26 23:27:41	Nikki89	thats fine
2016-07-26 23:27:48	@Espyo	plus, even if I did, I would spend most of my time not talking, since I'm always busy doing something else
2016-07-26 23:27:49	Nikki89	i can always pop onto here for you
2016-07-26 23:27:53	@Espyo	thanks
2016-07-26 23:28:04	@Espyo	or Marty or PikFan can let me know if there's a match about to happen
2016-07-26 23:28:12	Marty2000	Sure
2016-07-26 23:28:14	@Espyo	but you're welcome to pop in any time still, though!

2016-07-26 23:28:22	@PikFan	I've been trying to get Nikki and the others to move to discord since we've been having issues with skype also
2016-07-26 23:28:23	Nikki89	we're in turf atm if you wanna pop in now
2016-07-26 23:28:24	@Espyo	sorry for the late reply
2016-07-26 23:28:31	@Espyo	haven't tried again today
2016-07-26 23:28:33	Scruffy	Heh, no problem
2016-07-26 23:28:39	@Espyo	but I still keep thinking about Love Rap and how it works
2016-07-26 23:28:41	@Espyo	and it's just so complex
2016-07-26 23:28:45	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-26 23:28:53	@Espyo	PikFan: good luck, it really is night-and-day
2016-07-26 23:29:07	@Espyo	on one hand, you tell me it's split in sixteenth notes
2016-07-26 23:29:15	@Espyo	on the other, the guy in the video says it's swing notes, so I should split in 12th
2016-07-26 23:29:31	@Espyo	and what my finger is saying is "just get the timing down so I can press A when you send me the signal"
2016-07-26 23:31:09	Scruffy	I see, he split one measure into 8 quarter notes
2016-07-26 23:31:24	Scruffy	Whereas I'm splitting it into 4
2016-07-26 23:32:00	Scruffy	And he's considering each beat as being composed of a "1/6 note
2016-07-26 23:32:06	Scruffy	 and a "1/12 note"
2016-07-26 23:32:10	Scruffy	Which don't exist
2016-07-26 23:32:22	@Espyo	heh
2016-07-26 23:32:32	@Espyo	well, in theory, you could split any note by any divisor, right?
2016-07-26 23:32:53	Scruffy	Yes, but we tend to go with powers of two
2016-07-26 23:33:04	@Espyo	because it's simpler, yes
2016-07-26 23:33:08	Scruffy	Right
2016-07-26 23:33:12	@Espyo	well, that, and dividing by multiples of three, right?
2016-07-26 23:33:41	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-26 23:33:47	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-07-26 23:33:58	Scruffy	When you "swing" something, you're taking two notes and interpolating them over a division of three
2016-07-26 23:34:03	@Espyo	but that's just it, if we can divide by multiples of three, why won't a 1/6th note work?
2016-07-26 23:34:52	Scruffy	We write two notes, but when we say "swing" them, that means it's implied that they are a triplet
2016-07-26 23:35:10	Scruffy	Where the first note last 2/3 of the beat and the second lasts 1/3
2016-07-26 23:35:36	Scruffy	It's an implied feel that prevents composers from having to write triplet markings over every note in a swing song
2016-07-26 23:35:52	Scruffy	Because triplets are normally grouped in brackets with a "3" on top
2016-07-26 23:36:03	Scruffy	and no musician wants to see that all over their page
2016-07-26 23:36:35	Scruffy	It's a matter of simplicity
2016-07-26 23:37:00	Scruffy	That's why I advised to divide the measure in 16, and then feel the swing of it
2016-07-26 23:37:45	Scruffy	Since no cues are going to occur in between swung sixteenth notes, it's the simplest way to consider it and write it down
2016-07-26 23:38:07	@Espyo	remind me: a fourth note is one beat long, at 4/4 time signature, right?
2016-07-26 23:38:39	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-26 23:38:48	Scruffy	An eighth note is one half of a beat
2016-07-26 23:38:58	Scruffy	And a sixteenth note is one fourth of a beat
2016-07-26 23:38:59	@Espyo	right
2016-07-26 23:39:06	@Espyo	that actually messed with me a bit yesterday
2016-07-26 23:39:13	@Espyo	I was thinking I had to divide each BEAT by 16
2016-07-26 23:39:17	@Espyo	instead of each measure
2016-07-26 23:39:22	Scruffy	oh shoot
2016-07-26 23:39:25	Scruffy	Sorry about that
2016-07-26 23:39:28	@Espyo	it's fine
2016-07-26 23:39:30	Scruffy	Yeah, that's impossible
2016-07-26 23:39:39	@Espyo	I learned several times in the past that it's based on the measures, not on the notes
2016-07-26 23:39:41	@Espyo	but I just keep forgetting

2016-07-26 23:40:16	@Espyo	okay, so
2016-07-26 23:40:24	@Espyo	if you have two notes per beat
2016-07-26 23:40:36	@Espyo	one of them lasts 2/3 of a beat, and the other lasts 1/3
2016-07-26 23:40:47	@Espyo	that means dividing a beat in three would be the way to go
2016-07-26 23:40:53	@Espyo	so why do you recommend dividing the beat into four?
2016-07-26 23:41:40	Scruffy	Here's where I've made a mistake
2016-07-26 23:41:55	Scruffy	The /sixteenth/ notes are swung, not the /beat/
2016-07-26 23:42:23	@Espyo	but shouldn't they be eight notes?
2016-07-26 23:42:25	@Espyo	since there's two notes per beat?
2016-07-26 23:42:56	Scruffy	They should be sixteenth notes, there are four notes per beat, and the swing feel divides each beat into /six/
2016-07-26 23:43:30	Scruffy	So for each group of two sixteenth notes, the first lasts 2/6 of a beat, and the second lasts 1/6
2016-07-26 23:44:15	@Espyo	see, that's part of what I don't follow
2016-07-26 23:44:24	@Espyo	why call them sixteenth notes, when there's only 2 per beat?
2016-07-26 23:44:37	@Espyo	they should be called eighth notes

2016-07-26 23:44:59	Scruffy	That adds up to 1/2
2016-07-26 23:45:04	Scruffy	Then that happens again
2016-07-26 23:45:07	Scruffy	And that's one beat

2016-07-26 23:46:02	Scruffy	– - – -
2016-07-26 23:46:28	Scruffy	That's one beat of sixteenth notes, each group of two is swung but it takes four to equal a beat
2016-07-26 23:46:50	Scruffy	So it takes 16 of them, or 8 groups of swung notes, to equal a measure
2016-07-26 23:48:54	Scruffy	Another way to think of it is "to you" from the phrase "in-to you"
2016-07-26 23:49:06	Scruffy	"to you" is a group of two swung sixteenth notes
2016-07-26 23:49:10	@Espyo	oh!
2016-07-26 23:49:16	@Espyo	okay, okay, it's making sense now
2016-07-26 23:49:29	Scruffy	If you just repeated "to you to you to you to you to you to you to you to you" it'd be one measure

2016-07-26 23:49:35	@Espyo	that's one measure ^
2016-07-26 23:49:37	Scruffy	Yes
2016-07-26 23:49:45	@Espyo	okay! sorry I didn't get that before
2016-07-26 23:49:58	@Espyo	it's a LOT of numbers, and I was actually starting to see halves in quarters, quarters in halves, etc.
2016-07-26 23:50:01	@Espyo	what a mess
2016-07-26 23:50:02	Scruffy	No problem, this'd be a lot easier if I had a diagram or something
2016-07-26 23:50:06	@Espyo	very
2016-07-26 23:50:17	Scruffy	Anyway, yes, that's the way
2016-07-26 23:50:18	@Espyo	I am so much more a visual learner than a theoritical one
2016-07-26 23:50:41	@Espyo	okay, it makes perfect sense
2016-07-26 23:51:02	@Espyo	but... it's still such a small granularity
2016-07-26 23:51:06	@Espyo	it's hard to follow through
2016-07-26 23:51:14	Scruffy	Granularity?
2016-07-26 23:51:14	@Espyo	if it were slower, I think I'd be able to follow
2016-07-26 23:51:17	Scruffy	Ah
2016-07-26 23:51:26	@Espyo	...that's not a bad idea
2016-07-26 23:51:35	@Espyo	I'll try to play something that's really slow
2016-07-26 23:51:38	@Espyo	and then gradually speed up
2016-07-26 23:51:48	Scruffy	Perfect
2016-07-26 23:51:49	@Espyo	until I can just think about Love Rap's swing sixteenth notes
2016-07-26 23:51:56	@Espyo	without having to count them
2016-07-26 23:51:59	@Espyo	this might actually work!
2016-07-26 23:52:06	@Espyo	now, I can probably tinker around with LMMS
2016-07-26 23:52:09	Scruffy	That's always the way to practice a hard piece of music: start slow and work it up
2016-07-26 23:52:17	@Espyo	ah, that's great to know!
2016-07-26 23:52:28	@Espyo	I tried messing with LMMS yesterday to do something like that, but it didn't end so well
2016-07-26 23:52:30	@Espyo	hmm
2016-07-26 23:52:33	@Espyo	sorry to bother, but
2016-07-26 23:52:40	@Espyo	do you think you could write a very quick MIDI that does that?
2016-07-26 23:52:47	Scruffy	Of course!
2016-07-26 23:53:01	@Espyo	I can just import that on whatever program I want, like LMMS, and play it at my leisure
2016-07-26 23:53:02	Scruffy	How would you want it
2016-07-26 23:53:03	@Espyo	thank you so much!
2016-07-26 23:53:11	Scruffy	Ah, as a Midi file okay
2016-07-26 23:53:11	@Espyo	how do you think would be best for me to learn?
2016-07-26 23:53:15	@Espyo	oh
2016-07-26 23:53:18	@Espyo	yeah, MIDI would work great
2016-07-26 23:54:03	Scruffy	So I'll can create a short MIDI track with swung sixteenth notes, for four measures
2016-07-26 23:54:10	@Espyo	right
2016-07-27 00:00:19	Scruffy	Actually, while you're practicing this slowly, it might be helpful to hear the "1-and-a-2-and-a-3-and-a-4-and-a" division, just to get a rigid rhythm going in your head
2016-07-27 00:00:34	@Espyo	ah, yes
2016-07-27 00:00:36	@Espyo	but in that case
2016-07-27 00:00:55	@Espyo	I wouldn't want to say them with the same interval of time from one another, right?
2016-07-27 00:01:14	Scruffy	Right
2016-07-27 00:01:24	Scruffy	Just think "da-da-da-da-da-da"
2016-07-27 00:01:33	@Espyo	right
2016-07-27 00:01:37	Scruffy	But count "one... and two... and"
2016-07-27 00:02:43	@Espyo	right, right, right
2016-07-27 00:02:57	@Espyo	I need to go to bed
2016-07-27 00:03:02	@Espyo	but if you can send me it tomorrow, I'd love that
2016-07-27 00:03:05	@PikFan	night Espyo
2016-07-27 00:04:04	Scruffy	Oh, here it is
2016-07-27 00:04:05	Scruffy	The Pikmin ran to your side! They seem to remember you, Captain Olimar! How fascinating
2016-07-27 00:04:08	Scruffy	Wait
2016-07-27 00:04:11	Scruffy	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ed0fee6eeh9lv5i/AADZsxwaUMYfo0EB49IRr2Q9a?dl=0
2016-07-27 00:04:21	@Espyo	wrong copy-paste?
2016-07-27 00:04:27	Scruffy	heh, yes
2016-07-27 00:04:49	Scruffy	LMMS may not quite notate it prettily, but the rhythm you hear should be good
2016-07-27 00:04:57	@Espyo	right
2016-07-27 00:05:06	@Espyo	plus it doesn't have the best history with MIDI file import
2016-07-27 00:05:09	@Espyo	but I'll manage
2016-07-27 00:05:12	Scruffy	Right
2016-07-27 00:05:15	@Espyo	all I really want for now is to control the speed
2016-07-27 00:05:18	@Espyo	thank you so much, Scruffy
2016-07-27 00:05:19	@Espyo	I mean it
2016-07-27 00:05:21	Scruffy	This is only one track of any instrument
2016-07-27 00:05:29	Scruffy	Any time, I love teaching music
2016-07-27 00:05:40	@Espyo	and I love how patient you are
2016-07-27 00:05:51	@Espyo	I like to think of myself as being a patient teacher to the things I know too
2016-07-27 00:05:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-07-27 00:06:07	@Espyo	but when you're the student, and you realize that some things are making you stumble whereas they're super easy to the teacher, it's easy to be self-conscious
2016-07-27 00:06:11	@Espyo	thank you for being patient
2016-07-27 00:06:32	Scruffy	Of course, I just want these ideas to be spread above all
2016-07-27 00:06:40	@Espyo	hehe, great
2016-07-27 00:06:40	Scruffy	Music improves all other disciplines of life
2016-07-27 00:06:44	@Espyo	definitely
2016-07-27 00:06:48	@Espyo	really gotta go now, night

2016-07-27 20:01:30	Marty2000	<Marty2000>: Reminder: on the English version of P3, we have the message "Some Pikmin will perish", but it's not said how many of them will die. On the French version, they indicate how many Pikmin are going to die.

2016-07-27 20:02:26	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-07-27 20:02:27	@Espyo	odd
2016-07-27 20:02:29	@Espyo	I didn't know either
2016-07-27 20:02:37	@Espyo	but then, I never really leave enemies alive to have seen #2
2016-07-27 20:02:46	@Espyo	is #1 true for the American version too?
2016-07-27 20:02:51	@Espyo	it'll be hard to know without asking somebody
2016-07-27 20:03:03	Marty2000	I think it is (if you're talking about English)
2016-07-27 20:03:15	Marty2000	I don't know for French, since there's no French US community :p

2016-07-27 20:04:06	@Espyo	uh
2016-07-27 20:04:09	@Espyo	well, you know, the day article
2016-07-27 20:04:12	@Espyo	I'll setup Testyo today
2016-07-27 20:04:20	Marty2000	Okay
2016-07-27 20:04:27	@Espyo	also
2016-07-27 20:04:36	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-07-27 20:04:37	@Espyo	add a {{game help}} asking American players
2016-07-27 20:04:46	@Espyo	you can do {{game help|p3us}}, I think
2016-07-27 20:04:51	@Espyo	to call for specifically American players
2016-07-27 20:05:01	Marty2000	Okay (to see if it's the same with their French version?)
2016-07-27 20:05:06	Marty2000	Okay
2016-07-27 20:05:14	Marty2000	Yeah, they could change the language of their console
2016-07-27 20:05:43	Marty2000	I wonder if it's the same in other languages (Spanish, Italian, German)
2016-07-27 20:05:52	Yoshi2	when will testyo come back? :<
2016-07-27 20:05:55	Marty2000	I suppose I'll verify with Youtube videos first
2016-07-27 20:07:43	Marty2000	... On second thought, this'll take too much time
2016-07-27 20:07:54	@Espyo	to see if it's the same with any language on the US version
2016-07-27 20:07:57	Marty2000	It'd probably be faster if I verified using my own console
2016-07-27 20:08:02	Marty2000	Okay

2016-07-27 20:08:13	@Espyo	actually
2016-07-27 20:08:17	@Espyo	I can just check the game's strings
2016-07-27 20:08:18	@Espyo	one sec
2016-07-27 20:09:11	Yoshi2	I wonder if I can take my C knowledge and run with it in terms of c++ programming
2016-07-27 20:09:18	Marty2000	Oh, nice. Okay
2016-07-27 20:09:26	@Espyo	you can
2016-07-27 20:09:31	@Espyo	but you need to be ready to evolve it
2016-07-27 20:11:35	Yoshi2	my idea is try to make a terrain viewer/editor thing with imgui
2016-07-27 20:11:57	@Espyo	ooh, yeah
2016-07-27 20:11:59	@Espyo	that'd be great
2016-07-27 20:12:55	Yoshi2	which means I get to learn some c++ and see wtf is up with imgui and suffer through the process, all at once
2016-07-27 20:13:05	@Espyo	yep
2016-07-27 20:14:59	@Espyo	Marty2000: exact same message between US and EU

2016-07-27 20:24:01	@Espyo	NOTE: this is in the European ISO
2016-07-27 20:24:03	Yoshi2	I wonder why that string is so odd
2016-07-27 20:24:07	@Espyo	so I can't be 100% sure that the Japanese version is different
2016-07-27 20:24:20	@Espyo	it's just PyMSBT, the program I'm using to read the strings
2016-07-27 20:24:34	@Espyo	it's its way of interpreting special data
2016-07-27 20:25:13	Marty2000	Spanish as well, then
2016-07-27 20:25:23	Marty2000	Okay

2016-07-27 20:26:30	@Espyo	>lowercase pikmin
2016-07-27 20:26:30	@Espyo	cancer
2016-07-27 20:26:43	@Espyo	also, that's US Spanish, and the last of them
2016-07-27 20:26:51	@Espyo	these are all inside the European ISO
2016-07-27 20:27:04	@Espyo	so I can't be sure that the Japanese and US strings aren't different inside their actual versions of the game
2016-07-27 20:27:13	@Espyo	I don't know why the European version of the game even has the US and Japanese strings
2016-07-27 20:27:15	@Espyo	but *shrug*
2016-07-27 20:27:54	Marty2000	Because it's Pikmin
2016-07-27 20:28:00	Marty2000	Thanks for checking anyway
2016-07-27 20:29:20	@Espyo	huh, the US Spanish version always refers to them as pikmin
2016-07-27 20:29:27	@Espyo	again, at least on the files in the European copy
2016-07-27 20:29:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: was the European version released sooner or later than the other versions?
2016-07-27 20:29:48	@Espyo	I think later
2016-07-27 20:29:50	@Espyo	[[Pikmin 3]]
2016-07-27 20:29:51	@Espyo	...
2016-07-27 20:30:02	@Espyo	Testyo's always needed the most when he's not around
2016-07-27 20:30:28	@Espyo	yeah, just double-checked, it's written as Pikmin in the European version
2016-07-27 20:30:32	Yoshi2	then it sorta makes sense the US/Japanese strings are included
2016-07-27 20:30:35	@Espyo	we have to check with somebody who owns the US copy
2016-07-27 20:30:46	@Espyo	it makes sense that they exist, but not so much that they're included
2016-07-27 20:30:49	@Espyo	bit of a waste of space, imo
2016-07-27 20:31:20	@Espyo	okay, so
2016-07-27 20:31:29	@Espyo	Marty2000: I think it's safe to say that all languages get the number apart from English
2016-07-27 20:31:37	Yoshi2	the EU version of BW has the Japanese strings included even though the Japanese version released months later
2016-07-27 20:32:23	@Espyo	so add it to the article with that in mind
2016-07-27 20:32:30	@Espyo	hm, now that's a bit odder
2016-07-27 20:32:44	Yoshi2	which makes less sense than the EU version of Pikmin having the US/JP strings included if this one was released later
2016-07-27 20:32:57	Yoshi2	now if I had the JP version of BW............
2016-07-27 20:33:01	Marty2000	I'll keep that in mind and add it later

2016-07-27 21:52:43	@Espyo	I see you already noticed my nomination, Marty
2016-07-27 21:52:54	@Espyo	think you can complete the list of 10-pellets?
2016-07-27 21:55:02	Marty2000	Sure, i'll do
2016-07-27 21:55:04	Marty2000	I'll*
2016-07-27 21:55:22	@Espyo	thanks
2016-07-27 21:55:30	@Espyo	the idea is not to get a list of all pellets
2016-07-27 21:55:31	Marty2000	I think i already verified once, but I wasn't sure whether I had to add Mission Mode locations or not
2016-07-27 21:55:34	@Espyo	maybe one day in the future
2016-07-27 21:55:38	@Espyo	but for now, to get a list of all 10-pellets
2016-07-27 21:55:42	@Espyo	since they're pretty rare and important
2016-07-27 21:55:43	Marty2000	(you answered it)

2016-07-27 21:57:52	Scruffy	I know there's one in the Tropical Wilds by the Pyroclasmic Slooches
2016-07-27 21:58:24	@Espyo	isn't that a five?
2016-07-27 21:58:34	Marty2000	No, it's 10
2016-07-27 21:58:35	Marty2000	And always red
2016-07-27 21:58:41	Marty2000	There's a second one on the same area
2016-07-27 21:58:54	Marty2000	2 on the Twilight River (one of them is always pink)
2016-07-27 21:59:15	Marty2000	I don't think there are 10 Pellets on the Gardne of Hope (and sure there's no one in the FGormidable Oak)
2016-07-27 21:59:16	@Espyo	ah
2016-07-27 21:59:18	Marty2000	Formidable*
2016-07-27 21:59:52	Scruffy	Oh, and I think there's a gray 10 Pellet in the water by the Toady Bloyster in The Rustyard battle enemies
2016-07-27 21:59:56	Marty2000	I'll tale a look on Mission Mode afterwards. I don't remember seeing one on Bingo Battle, by the way
2016-07-27 22:00:01	Marty2000	take*
2016-07-27 22:00:09	Marty2000	Oh, nice
2016-07-27 22:00:12	Scruffy	I remember it because it's obviously there to tease you
2016-07-27 22:00:13	Marty2000	I'll verify, thanks
2016-07-27 22:00:56	Marty2000	No 10 pellet on the Garden of Hope
2016-07-27 22:00:58	Scruffy	I'm not sure if there are any other 10 pellets in Pikmin 3 that aren't on Pellet Posies
2016-07-27 22:01:17	Marty2000	I think there's one in the water somewhere, but I can't remember where
2016-07-27 22:01:22	@Espyo	somebody searched for "buddhisme" on Pikipedia in the last two months

2016-07-27 22:11:27	Marty2000	Well then, I'll add it and remove the template

2016-07-28 20:30:06	@Espyo	the todo mentions that FOR EACH GAME, we needed the answers to those questions
2016-07-28 20:30:12	@Espyo	and I think that that edit only answers for Pikmin 3
2016-07-28 20:30:19	@Espyo	I can't really tell which game it is, or if it even is only a single game
2016-07-28 20:30:26	@Espyo	could very well be answering for all three games
2016-07-28 20:30:43	@Espyo	but the fact that they say "and the affected Onion will spew out a single seed."
2016-07-28 20:30:48	@Espyo	makes me think this is Pikmin 3 only
2016-07-28 20:30:56	@Espyo	since in P1 or P2, the Onions don't instantly eject a new seed
2016-07-28 20:31:18	@Espyo	so we should confirm what happens in P1 and P2, for both of the questions
2016-07-28 20:31:25	@Espyo	as well as confirm if that really is what happens in P3
2016-07-28 20:31:30	Marty2000	In P1 and P2, they will eject a seed if there's no Pikmin of their type in the current area (and if you begina new day)
2016-07-28 20:31:38	Marty2000	Okay
2016-07-28 20:31:40	@Espyo	these kind of extinction events are really complicated (and I'm terrified of having to code them in on the engine one day ;~;)
2016-07-28 20:31:50	@Espyo	so this deserves a lot more science
2016-07-28 20:31:56	@Espyo	plus, the user wrote that information in a really awkward spot
2016-07-28 20:32:15	@Espyo	the first paragraph is introducing the reader on the types of extinctions, and that user wrote the answers there
2016-07-28 20:32:18	@Espyo	really awkward
2016-07-28 20:32:32	Marty2000	I see
2016-07-28 20:32:45	Marty2000	Well then, i'll start by P1
2016-07-28 20:32:47	Marty2000	I'll*
2016-07-28 20:33:04	@Espyo	right, if you begin a new day, but what if you lose all of one type in the current area, but there are others in another area?
2016-07-28 20:33:07	@Espyo	what happens at that exact moment?
2016-07-28 20:33:17	@Espyo	also, what happens if you lose ALL types or just one type?
2016-07-28 20:33:21	@Espyo	see, none of these questions are answered
2016-07-28 20:33:25	Marty2000	In P1?
2016-07-28 20:33:27	@Espyo	so it's pretty sucky to have that answer there
2016-07-28 20:33:29	@Espyo	in all games
2016-07-28 20:33:41	Marty2000	Onions do not eject a seed before the next day, in the first two games
2016-07-28 20:33:45	Marty2000	Okay

2016-07-28 20:39:31	Marty2000	Okay, so, basically... tell me if what I'm going to do first is okay for you: I'll throw some Yellow Pikmin into a Golden Candypop Buds, kill the rest in the most cruel ways, end the day, and land on another area (where there's no Yellow Pikmin). Then, I'll travel into the past, redo the same, but land on the same area where the Yellow Pikmin and Candypop Bud
2016-07-28 20:40:01	@Espyo	oh, you'll do the bud thing first? all right
2016-07-28 20:40:09	Marty2000	For the first experiment, I think the Onion will eject a seed
2016-07-28 20:40:20	Marty2000	For the second experiment, it will very likely not
2016-07-28 20:40:29	Marty2000	But let's give it  atry, that's worth it
2016-07-28 20:40:32	Marty2000	a try*
2016-07-28 20:40:46	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-07-28 20:40:55	@Espyo	I didn't think about going into an area with no seeds
2016-07-28 20:41:12	@Espyo	I just thought "you have 2 of each type with you today, you destroy one of the types, what happens?"
2016-07-28 20:41:17	@Espyo	but I guess that experiment is important too
2016-07-28 20:41:32	@Espyo	and yeah, I agree with your predictions
2016-07-28 20:42:01	Marty2000	Oh, right
2016-07-28 20:45:46	Marty2000	Okay, our predictions for the firstexperiments were right. Now, if I understand, you want me to kill an entire Pikmin type on a single day and see if something in particular happens, right?
2016-07-28 20:49:03	Marty2000	All of my Yellow Pikmin have been killed, their Onion didn't spit ou any seed, though
2016-07-28 20:49:09	Marty2000	out
2016-07-28 20:49:21	Marty2000	(I haven't ended the day yet)
2016-07-28 20:51:33	Yoshi2	are we advocating for pikmin genocide again

2016-07-28 20:55:35	@Espyo	I want to know if Olimar says anything, if the Onion does something, etc., or if absolutely nothing happens
2016-07-28 20:55:40	@Espyo	because the latter has gameplay implications
2016-07-28 20:55:51	@Espyo	in that the player could have lost all of their Yellows in this area without even realizing
2016-07-28 20:58:24	Marty2000	Well, nothing happened then. The Onion will only eject a seed 1) the day after the extinction 2) if there are no Pikmin of that type planted somewhere on the area
2016-07-28 20:58:42	@Espyo	right
2016-07-28 20:58:45	@Espyo	that's good info to add
2016-07-28 20:59:30	Marty2000	For Pikmin 2, entering a cave and leaving it is considered as "a new day" (it's the same behaviour as P1, except that you can enter and leave the cave to have an Onion eject a seed, instead of ending the day)
2016-07-28 21:02:07	@Espyo	right
2016-07-28 21:07:42	--	UltraMario is now known as UltraMikeSchmidt
2016-07-28 21:20:41	Scruffy	So in /Pikmin/, there's an extinction cutscene only if you begin a day an area with no Pikmin of one type and there are no Pikmin buried there?
2016-07-28 21:24:38	Marty2000	Yes
2016-07-28 21:26:21	Scruffy	Cool, so that means it may not necessarily be an extinction if Pikmin are buried in a different area, but the game treats it as an extinction

2016-07-29 21:21:59	Yoshi2	I will be very sad when I finish this third game, because the fourth game is full-prized
2016-07-29 21:22:08	Yoshi2	which means I can't shell out money that easily
2016-07-29 21:22:44	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-07-29 21:22:48	@Espyo	aww
2016-07-29 21:23:20	Yoshi2	I will have to check if it has as many copypasted dungeons as the third game
2016-07-29 21:23:31	Yoshi2	because holy crap, the third game has almost only copypasted dungeons
2016-07-29 21:23:50	Yoshi2	I counted maybe 2 dungeon types that weren't in the previous games
2016-07-29 21:24:21	@Espyo	Pikmin 2's areas in a nutshell
2016-07-29 21:25:01	Yoshi2	except pikmin 2 actually has original areas, doesn't it?
2016-07-29 21:25:05	Yoshi2	at least the overworld
2016-07-29 21:25:47	@Espyo	one original area on the overworld
2016-07-29 21:25:54	@Espyo	all other 3 areas are remakes of Pikmin 1
2016-07-29 21:25:57	@Espyo	all caves are fully new, though
2016-07-29 21:26:00	Yoshi2	ah
2016-07-29 21:26:00	@Espyo	P1 didn't even have caves
2016-07-29 21:27:19	Yoshi2	well, the worst part with neptunia is that the dungeons that are copypasted,
2016-07-29 21:27:23	Yoshi2	are copypasted again
2016-07-29 21:27:32	@Espyo	hah
2016-07-29 21:28:04	Yoshi2	so you have dungeons from the previous games repeated several times for different areas, and the new dungeons are also repeated
2016-07-29 21:28:49	Yoshi2	and every single regular monster type is also copypasted from previous games
2016-07-29 21:28:49	@Espyo	man
2016-07-29 21:29:18	Yoshi2	there are a few completely new main bosses
2016-07-29 21:29:29	Yoshi2	but whew, the copypaste is STRONG with this one
2016-07-29 21:29:47	@Espyo	yikes
2016-07-29 21:29:55	@Espyo	I'm trying to remember another game that was like that
2016-07-29 21:30:00	@Espyo	but the only one I can think of really is Pikmin 2
2016-07-29 21:30:04	@Espyo	and it's not even that much

2016-07-29 21:32:11	Marty2000	But the second is a copypaste of the challenges found in the first game
2016-07-29 21:32:21	Marty2000	(with more challenges, naturally)
2016-07-29 21:32:31	Yoshi2	pretty decent dialogue, artwork and voice acting, but I can see why the games aren't getting 10 out of 10 points in reviews
2016-07-29 21:32:45	Marty2000	I see
2016-07-29 21:33:16	Yoshi2	(although they are getting 10 out of 10 points by people who like jrpgs and cute animu girls for obvious reasons)
2016-07-29 21:34:55	@Espyo	hm
2016-07-29 21:35:13	Yoshi2	most of the budget definitely went into character design and it shows
2016-07-29 21:35:33	Yoshi2	every single character is waifu material, even that grumpy old business man

2016-07-30 12:52:16	@Espyo	wow
2016-07-30 12:52:25	@Espyo	the Cemu subreddit is a joke
2016-07-30 12:52:48	@Espyo	 1% of the posts are about the emulator's development and technology breakthroughs
2016-07-30 12:52:53	@Espyo	 1% are about fixing common issues
2016-07-30 12:53:16	@Espyo	 98% are kids that use Cemu to play Wii U games for free and don't have the slightest idea of what an emulator or ROM is, or how Cemu is still very young
2016-07-30 12:53:27	@Espyo	the amount of posts of "how do I play Mario Kart 8 online" are insane
2016-07-30 12:53:30	@Espyo	https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/4v6qu4/i_cant_press_s_and_save_my_tutorial_in_super/
2016-07-30 12:53:33	@Espyo	but this guy probably takes the cake
2016-07-30 12:53:50	@Espyo	when making a level in SMM, there's a little S icon that scrolls back the camera to the start
2016-07-30 12:53:59	@Espyo	this idiot tried to press the S key on the keyboard on this dialog
2016-07-30 12:54:21	@Espyo	YES, BECAUSE EMULATING A GAME MEANS THAT NINTENDO ADDED CODE FOR IT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S BEING PLAYED ON A HOME COMPUTER, AND CHANGE ITS MESSAGE TO REFLECT WHICH KEYBOARD KEY YOU HAVE TO PRESS

2016-07-30 14:40:57	@Espyo	and the jump script just made them jump through the world because they didn't reach the lily pad on time

2016-07-30 14:50:24	Marty2000	I think it's likely the latter

2016-07-30 17:07:13	@Espyo	hi
2016-07-30 17:07:13	Marty2000	Hello Scruffy
2016-07-30 17:07:35	@Espyo	so, I'm trying to see if I can follow Love Rap with swing notes
2016-07-30 17:07:38	@Espyo	but it's just so impossibly fast...
2016-07-30 17:07:48	@Espyo	and the music is so minimalistic, I can't even rely on it for help
2016-07-30 17:07:58	@Espyo	what's worse is that I don't have to follow the beat
2016-07-30 17:08:08	@Espyo	I have to press A on arbitrary points in the rhythm
2016-07-30 17:08:15	@Espyo	following it wouldn't be so bad, since it becomes natural after some seconds
2016-07-30 17:08:18	Yoshi2	INTO YOU
2016-07-30 17:08:40	@Espyo	but following the rhythm, fitting into her lines, and planning your line for the next note
2016-07-30 17:08:42	@Espyo	it's just too impossible
2016-07-30 17:08:56	@Espyo	I'll take my chances on rewatching the Perfect playthrough video ad infinitum till I get the timing down
2016-07-30 17:09:14	Scruffy	Heh, no problem

2016-07-30 17:09:25	Scruffy	Yeah, it seems really difficult to predict
2016-07-30 17:09:41	@Espyo	good thing this one doesn't return in Megamix for the 3DS
2016-07-30 17:10:04	Yoshi2	i like love rap :(
2016-07-30 17:10:18	Scruffy	But do you love it?
2016-07-30 17:10:21	@Espyo	you like the idea of my suffering over Love Rap
2016-07-30 17:10:22	@Espyo	there's a difference
2016-07-30 17:11:13	Scruffy	I like the music to it, there's nice harmonic substitution going on in it
2016-07-30 17:11:21	Scruffy	But trying to follow along is quite difficult
2016-07-30 17:11:31	Scruffy	especially at remix 10 speed
2016-07-30 17:11:33	@Espyo	ok, so it's not just me
2016-07-30 17:11:58	Scruffy	it's like predicting what a soloist is going to do next
2016-07-30 17:12:14	Scruffy	with only a little preparation
2016-07-30 17:12:47	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-30 17:12:47	Scruffy	Although I feel like it would be easier if you were actually on the set of Love Rap singing the lines
2016-07-30 17:14:58	@Espyo	probably, yeah
2016-07-30 17:15:10	@Espyo	plus, if anything, there's a lot of secondary stuff going on that makes it hard
2016-07-30 17:15:16	@Espyo	for one thing, the different mini-games
2016-07-30 17:15:23	@Espyo	you're not following swing rhythm throughout
2016-07-30 17:15:28	@Espyo	you just enter it midway through the entire stage
2016-07-30 17:15:36	@Espyo	plus, the tension of having survived the Perfect so long to get here
2016-07-30 17:15:40	@Espyo	"this is it, don't blow it!"
2016-07-30 17:15:55	Yoshi2	that is me every time I play project mirai

2016-07-31 18:12:27	Scruffy	Espyo, you might have already known this, but I just discovered there is no parameter in Pikmin 2 for specific carrying speed
2016-07-31 18:12:36	Scruffy	Carrying speed is entirely based on walking speed
2016-07-31 18:13:31	Scruffy	running speed*
2016-07-31 18:13:33	Scruffy	not walking
2016-07-31 18:15:04	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Goomba
2016-07-31 18:15:47	--	Goomba is now known as Yoshi2
2016-07-31 18:16:50	Scruffy	Also more interesting, if a Female Sheargrub is the first enemy you collect in a cave, it will /not/ activate the dialogue about storing enemies
2016-07-31 18:17:04	Scruffy	Male Sheargrub works, but not Female
2016-07-31 18:19:18	Yoshi2	do you mind if I steal you to do work on battalion wars? :-]

2016-07-31 18:25:15	Scruffy	One more discovery
2016-07-31 18:25:31	Scruffy	In the dialogue when you first see Blue Pikmin in the distance in the Awakening Wood
2016-07-31 18:25:51	Scruffy	There's an instruction that's given to the speech that doesn't seem to appear anywhere else
2016-07-31 18:26:17	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User talk:Princess Peach by LoganPikmin (+83 /* Uploading */ new section) http://www.pikminfanon.com/?curid=10481&diff=54264

2016-07-31 18:26:28	Scruffy	Normally, there's an instruction after the last punctuation that says "this is the end of the 3-line passage, create a break to the next passage"
2016-07-31 18:26:51	Scruffy	But in the dialogue, where the ship says by observing the Blue Pikmin, we can find out more about their true nature...
2016-07-31 18:27:05	Scruffy	There's instructions between each of the period in the ellipsis
2016-07-31 18:27:17	Scruffy	And it results in you not being able to speed up the following passage
2016-07-31 18:27:29	Scruffy	Where he says Krzzt! Ding! I apologize. I was momentarily entranced by them. Now, back to work!
2016-07-31 18:27:56	Scruffy	I guess the developers really wanted the ship to be entranced, so they made it that you can't speed up that line
2016-07-31 18:28:11	Yoshi2	wow
2016-07-31 18:29:10	Scruffy	Yeah, talk about arcane details
2016-07-31 18:29:10	@Espyo	oh, sorry, I was busy
2016-07-31 18:29:27	@Espyo	no parameter for the carrying speed... yeah, me and Marty tried to get some results
2016-07-31 18:29:29	@Espyo	didn't go very well
2016-07-31 18:29:31	@Espyo	it's such a blur
2016-07-31 18:29:46	@Espyo	ah, I knew about the Female Sheargrub thing
2016-07-31 18:29:49	@Espyo	somebody discovered it one day
2016-07-31 18:29:57	@Espyo	thing is, are there more enemies that do and don't trigger that cutscene?
2016-07-31 18:29:59	Scruffy	Poor Female Sheargrubs :(
2016-07-31 18:30:06	Scruffy	I'll have to figure that out
2016-07-31 18:31:00	@Espyo	hah, that really is awesome, that ship thing
2016-07-31 19:11:13	Scruffy	So far all other enemies I've tried cause the dialogue
2016-07-31 19:11:27	Scruffy	male sheargrubs, shearwigs, skitter leaves, mitites, breadbugs
2016-07-31 19:11:59	Scruffy	And I can't find any parameter that determines this, in the files for enemies or their carcasses
2016-07-31 19:12:06	Scruffy	But I've gotta get going for now, sorry
2016-07-31 19:12:12	Scruffy	Bye everyone
2016-07-31 19:12:33	Marty2000	See you
2016-07-31 19:15:26	@Espyo	bye
2016-07-31 19:15:32	@Espyo	yeah, if only there was a parameter

2016-07-31 21:13:15	@Espyo	it didn't
2016-07-31 21:13:37	Yoshi2	the rest of the convo is literally you asking "what text?"
2016-07-31 21:14:11	@Espyo	yeah
2016-07-31 21:14:20	@Espyo	the message text on the engine when you check a wooden sign?

2016-07-31 21:14:28	@Espyo	the text on editors? still black as always

2016-07-31 21:14:46	Yoshi2	you could ask him to make a screenshot of what he means
2016-07-31 21:14:59	@Espyo	might as well
2016-07-31 21:15:48	@Espyo	wait, looks like he's talking not about the engine, but about an enemy infobox
2016-07-31 21:15:51	@Espyo	which still doesn't make sense
2016-07-31 21:15:54	@Espyo	why would the text turn blue?
2016-07-31 21:16:25	Yoshi2	in which case he should link to what he means

2016-07-31 21:17:32	@Espyo	best I can imagine is he's got himself a virus that selects random words in the pages you visit, and turns them into blue links, that take you to shady shopping websites with searches for the item that's been made into a link
2016-07-31 21:17:40	@Espyo	I've seen some dumb forums do that
2016-07-31 21:17:48	@Espyo	I'd guess there's malware that does that too

2016-08-01 16:08:25	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-08-01 16:11:01	Yoshi2	hi Scruffy 
2016-08-01 16:11:28	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-08-01 16:12:03	Scruffy	So, Espyo noted that some dialogs were missing from the Ship's dialogs page
2016-08-01 16:12:15	Scruffy	And that made me realize we're missing a lot of template notes
2016-08-01 16:12:20	Marty2000	Quite a lot, to be honest
2016-08-01 16:12:25	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-01 16:12:44	Scruffy	I could fill those in for ship dialogs at least, but only for the Gamecube version
2016-08-01 16:12:51	Scruffy	I don't know the buttons for the Wii version
2016-08-01 16:13:17	Marty2000	You can ask him, but he told me not to do that some months ago
2016-08-01 16:13:28	Marty2000	I could do the Wii version (some dialogs are slightkly modfiied)
2016-08-01 16:13:31	Marty2000	slightly*
2016-08-01 16:13:40	Scruffy	Okay
2016-08-01 16:13:49	Scruffy	I wonder why he didn't want them filled in?
2016-08-01 16:14:19	Marty2000	He said he'd check the game files
2016-08-01 16:14:19	Scruffy	Perhaps because they don't have a common or official name
2016-08-01 16:14:36	Marty2000	Possibly

2016-08-01 18:57:10	Testyo	why in the world am I was waiting for you to catch on
2016-08-01 18:57:16	@Espyo	hey
2016-08-01 18:58:26	Yoshi2	i remember when I used to do modding
2016-08-01 18:58:30	Yoshi2	but I have to beat this game
2016-08-01 18:58:35	Yoshi2	and make a crappy comic
2016-08-01 19:00:26	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-01 19:00:29	@Espyo	and then modding
2016-08-01 19:00:34	@Espyo	until you get distracted by a new game
2016-08-01 19:02:59	Scruffy	Hi Espyo
2016-08-01 19:03:08	@Espyo	hey
2016-08-01 19:03:29	Scruffy	I wanted to ask about filling in the missing ship
2016-08-01 19:03:34	Scruffy	ship's dialog nots templates*
2016-08-01 19:03:51	Scruffy	Would that be okay to start doing?

2016-08-01 19:05:07	@Espyo	uhm
2016-08-01 19:05:24	@Espyo	if you want, but like I said, I'll make use of the dumped strings eventually
2016-08-01 19:05:28	@Espyo	which will replace everything we have
2016-08-01 19:05:33	@Espyo	so it'll be for naught
2016-08-01 19:05:42	@Espyo	you can fill in the two that are mentioned on the talk page, I guess
2016-08-01 19:05:49	Scruffy	Ah, okay
2016-08-01 19:06:19	Scruffy	Yeah, I just thought I could fill those in since I knew the two, but good to know there's a string you can dump for it
2016-08-01 19:06:45	Scruffy	Also, I found another instance of the "slow-down" dialog command
2016-08-01 19:07:09	Scruffy	When the ship says "This is the first time you have heard this? Olimar! Remember to properly train new employees!"
2016-08-01 19:07:34	Scruffy	After the question mark, the rest is unskippable, presumably to let that reproach sink in

2016-08-01 20:58:15	Yoshi2	when me and a few people I know were younger and played ragnarok online, we did a wedding for a friend and his gf
2016-08-01 20:58:21	Yoshi2	it was fun

2016-08-01 21:06:51	Marty2000	Cool
2016-08-01 21:11:45	@Espyo	new poll will be "What do you do when Pikmin die?"
2016-08-01 21:11:52	@Espyo	this is a bit of a tricky question, so I'll want feedback
2016-08-01 21:12:01	@Espyo	if the answers aren't laid out well, a lot of people will flock to the same one
2016-08-01 21:12:14	@Espyo	like, if one answer is "I restart if I'm doing a no-death run", then everybody will choose that
2016-08-01 21:12:22	@Espyo	because duh, of course you'll restart if one Pikmin dies
2016-08-01 21:12:32	@Espyo	yet not having that option is also kind of... incomplete
2016-08-01 21:12:52	@Espyo	using the options on the nominations page and thinking about it myself, I decided the following:
2016-08-01 21:12:56	@Espyo	 1) I keep going.
2016-08-01 21:13:00	@Espyo	 2) I restart depending on maturity and type.
2016-08-01 21:13:03	@Espyo	 3) I restart if a lot died.
2016-08-01 21:13:07	@Espyo	 4) I restart if any die!
2016-08-01 21:13:15	Marty2000	4)
2016-08-01 21:13:16	@Espyo	I think it might work, but I definitely need feedbac
2016-08-01 21:13:18	@Espyo	*k
2016-08-01 21:13:21	Marty2000	(for P2)
2016-08-01 21:13:23	@Espyo	more options? less? more descriptive? less?
2016-08-01 21:13:32	@Espyo	yeah, in your case, it depends on the game...
2016-08-01 21:13:36	@Espyo	that just adds more complexity
2016-08-01 21:13:41	Marty2000	Hmm, looks good
2016-08-01 21:13:42	Yoshi2	maybe more non-restarting options
2016-08-01 21:13:49	Marty2000	Maybe more options, but I can't think of any
2016-08-01 21:13:55	Scruffy	I agree with Yoshi2
2016-08-01 21:14:11	Scruffy	Like: I try to grow a new one
2016-08-01 21:16:42	Yoshi2	I don't mind if pikmin die, i try to be more careful, i try to grow more at once,...
2016-08-01 21:17:09	@Espyo	what options are there about not restarting?
2016-08-01 21:17:20	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-01 21:17:34	@Espyo	but see, I think those are a bit "depends" as well
2016-08-01 21:17:47	@Espyo	like, "I rebuild the lost ones" is a perfectly legitimate answer
2016-08-01 21:17:49	@Espyo	...but it depends
2016-08-01 21:18:02	@Espyo	if you lost one Pikmin, you're not going to go out of your way to find a 1-Pikmin enemy
2016-08-01 21:18:22	@Espyo	if you lose like 100, you may not be able to replenish in time and will need to restart the day
2016-08-01 21:18:30	@Espyo	the ones I chose are basic
2016-08-01 21:18:32	@Espyo	which is also a problem
2016-08-01 21:18:36	@Espyo	since they're also "depends"
2016-08-01 21:18:42	@Espyo	see what I mean when I said this was tricky?
2016-08-01 21:18:53	@Espyo	I could just add 30 options
2016-08-01 21:19:01	@Espyo	and then wonder what I was drinking when I made the poll
2016-08-01 21:19:42	Scruffy	so then maybe the poll should be "What do you do when a Pikmin dies?"
2016-08-01 21:19:51	@Espyo	a single Pikmin?
2016-08-01 21:19:51	Marty2000	Heh
2016-08-01 21:19:53	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-01 21:19:54	@Espyo	that's a good idea
2016-08-01 21:20:01	@Espyo	I'll think about it during dinner now

2016-08-01 21:36:43	Marty2000	Yes, I know
2016-08-01 21:36:51	Marty2000	But I still want to say bye, anyway$
2016-08-01 21:36:53	Marty2000	anyway
2016-08-01 21:39:17	Yoshi2	arghhhh this game crashes again, at the same spot
2016-08-01 21:47:13	@Espyo	hm, I don't think the "What do you do when a single Pikmin dies?" thing will work out
2016-08-01 21:51:30	Yoshi2	How do you deal with the death of your Pikmin?
2016-08-01 21:53:44	@Espyo	kind of the same thing as "What do you do when Pikmin die", I think...
2016-08-01 21:53:46	@Espyo	maybe...
2016-08-01 21:53:51	@Espyo	"What do you feel about Pikmin deaths?"
2016-08-01 21:53:58	@Espyo	>I don't care.
2016-08-01 21:54:12	@Espyo	>I feel sad, but insist on continuing.
2016-08-01 21:54:17	@Espyo	>I can't stand it, and have to restart!
2016-08-01 21:54:22	@Espyo	how's that?
2016-08-01 21:54:29	@Espyo	no more "depends", a death is a death
2016-08-01 21:54:36	Marty2000	Yes, might be better
2016-08-01 21:54:57	@Espyo	maybe instead of just one option for having to restart, we could have two, one for caring, and one for not
2016-08-01 21:55:12	@Espyo	>I don't care, but I restart since I need them
2016-08-01 21:55:17	@Espyo	>I can't stand it, and restart right away!
2016-08-01 21:55:25	@Espyo	how's this sound?
2016-08-01 21:58:37	@Espyo	guess I'll go ahead with it

2016-08-01 22:18:58	Yoshi2	.............i am unable to continue like this, ughhhhhhh
2016-08-01 22:19:08	Yoshi2	game keeps crashing at this specific point
2016-08-01 22:19:17	@Espyo	I hate that feeling
2016-08-01 22:19:22	@Espyo	of trying out fixes
2016-08-01 22:19:25	@Espyo	and then anxiously going to the same spot
2016-08-01 22:19:28	@Espyo	hoping it'll continue
2016-08-01 22:19:31	@Espyo	but it still crashes
2016-08-01 22:20:00	Yoshi2	even the old trick of setting the VA to Japanese didn't work, and speeding up dialogue didn't get past the crashing point
2016-08-01 22:24:01	Yoshi2	well, I will try the fixes some people have found tomorrow
2016-08-01 22:25:01	@Espyo	at least people have found some
2016-08-01 22:27:00	Yoshi2	the main fix is modifying the exe to use 4 gb instead of 2 max
2016-08-01 22:27:15	Yoshi2	on a machine that has 3 gb max, I am not sure how helpful that would be :-|
2016-08-01 22:28:01	@Espyo	woah
2016-08-01 22:33:03	Yoshi2	on a different note
2016-08-01 22:33:23	Yoshi2	i am modifying the irc lib that is used by a python relay bot for telegram
2016-08-01 22:33:30	Yoshi2	the irc lib is
2016-08-01 22:33:33	Yoshi2	crap
2016-08-01 22:33:43	@Espyo	hah, I bet
2016-08-01 22:33:58	Yoshi2	the telegram part of the bot is even more crap
2016-08-01 22:34:09	Yoshi2	but I don't know telegram so I am not touching that yet
2016-08-01 22:35:01	@Espyo	right
2016-08-01 22:36:12	Yoshi2	the irc lib isn't THAT poorly written, but it is single-threaded, as far as I can tell
2016-08-01 22:36:36	Yoshi2	or rather
2016-08-01 22:36:45	Yoshi2	the telegram bot uses it in a single threaded way
2016-08-01 22:36:57	@Espyo	that shouldn't be that much of a problem
2016-08-01 22:37:09	Yoshi2	idk, somehow I feel like it is
2016-08-01 22:37:17	Yoshi2	initial connection is sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
2016-08-01 22:37:25	Yoshi2	I can see each line being received every second
2016-08-01 22:40:13	@Espyo	heh
2016-08-01 22:40:20	@Espyo	maybe?
2016-08-01 22:44:02	Yoshi2	have you seen the MOTD of an irc server?
2016-08-01 22:44:18	@Espyo	don't we get it every day?
2016-08-01 22:44:22	Yoshi2	that is at least 20 lines or even more
2016-08-01 22:44:33	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2016-08-01 22:44:36	Yoshi2	now imagine if each line of the MOTD took a second to appear on your screen
2016-08-01 22:44:39	@Espyo	most MOTD are over 10 lines for sure
2016-08-01 22:44:45	@Espyo	...I get what you mean
2016-08-01 22:44:53	@Espyo	why's a bot printing the MOTD anyway, though?
2016-08-01 22:45:01	@Espyo	I still know what you mean, but I'm playing devil's advocate here
2016-08-01 22:46:17	Yoshi2	you are playing the noob's advocate
2016-08-01 22:46:27	@Espyo	omg no
2016-08-01 22:46:35	@Espyo	Testyo doesn't print the MOTD
2016-08-01 22:46:35	Testyo	one is an SQL injection that only works if you can impersonate another user
2016-08-01 22:46:35	Yoshi2	all things considered, printing to the console does not take one second
2016-08-01 22:46:38	@Espyo	and Testyo's basic
2016-08-01 22:46:38	Testyo	10 more missions and Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Shadow Wars (AKA American Fire Emblem) is to avoid ambiguity - for example, a filename might contain a tab or new line character
2016-08-01 22:47:16	Yoshi2	printing one line of text does not take one second
2016-08-01 22:47:31	Yoshi2	the fact that printing each line of the motd takes this bot one second means something is wrong with the lib
2016-08-01 22:47:41	@Espyo	wait, this isn't hypothetical?
2016-08-01 22:47:46	@Espyo	it actually does take one second per line?
2016-08-01 22:47:54	Yoshi2	it isn't hypothetical :|
2016-08-01 22:47:59	@Espyo	no fucking way
2016-08-01 22:48:06	@Espyo	I wouldn't say "something is wrong"
2016-08-01 22:48:10	@Espyo	I'd say "you're being trolled"
2016-08-01 22:48:14	@Espyo	it can't be that bad, that's insane
2016-08-01 22:48:29	Yoshi2	I am currently fixing this bot up by plugging in my own irc networking lib
2016-08-01 22:48:33	Yoshi2	hopefully it works out

2016-08-02 18:52:56	@Espyo	or maybe he just wants to give you the talk
2016-08-02 18:52:59	@Espyo	to stop with all the modding
2016-08-02 18:53:29	Yoshi2	I've talked with him a bit and it's definitely some high quality trolling if it is trolling
2016-08-02 18:54:08	@Espyo	it's complicated
2016-08-02 18:54:19	@Espyo	if he went through the trouble, why would it be on such a tiny community?
2016-08-02 18:54:38	@Espyo	yet, on the other hand, if he went through a lot of trouble to troll, say, the Mario community, into believing he's a dev, he'd be MUCH more likely to be proven a fake
2016-08-02 18:56:07	Yoshi2	https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/5e22e8a7e1e3efa7a28b84f3fb754490 excerpt from the logs for anybody who is curious
2016-08-02 18:56:37	Yoshi2	(it's headstrong)
2016-08-02 18:59:48	@Espyo	man, the first 10 lines are already so suspicious
2016-08-02 18:59:58	@Espyo	"I doubt it too"
2016-08-02 19:00:01	@Espyo	who says that?
2016-08-02 19:00:29	@Espyo	[1:17 PM] headstrong: I dont expect you to beleve me
2016-08-02 19:00:29	@Espyo	[1:18 PM] headstrong: fun fact the super wepon was origionaly gas based
2016-08-02 19:00:36	@Espyo	changing the subject super quick for no reason
2016-08-02 19:00:52	@Espyo	[1:58 PM] headstrong: how did you get the texture
2016-08-02 19:00:53	@Espyo	[1:58 PM] headstrong: must have been leaked
2016-08-02 19:00:54	@Espyo	oh come on
2016-08-02 19:00:56	@Espyo	he's fucking with you
2016-08-02 19:01:02	@Espyo	and not very subtly either
2016-08-02 19:04:12	Yoshi2	certainly, I am not fully convinced about him being the real deal but the trolling seems high quality enough to leave both me and one other mod confused
2016-08-02 19:04:35	Yoshi2	so I'm kinda looking forward to what he will do next or if he will disappear
2016-08-02 19:05:33	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-08-02 19:06:58	Yoshi2	i mean come on, how many people have played BW?
2016-08-02 19:07:03	Yoshi2	there is literally dozens of us
2016-08-02 19:07:26	@PikFan	lag + .96 Gal Decos = *absolute and utter evil*
2016-08-02 19:07:32	 *	@PikFan sighs
2016-08-02 19:07:57	@PikFan	...forgot that bolding doesn't work like that on mibbit lol
2016-08-02 19:08:38	@Espyo	Gal = evil
2016-08-02 19:11:50	@PikFan	more than half of all weapons = evil
2016-08-02 19:12:56	@Espyo	look, can we talk dynamos for a second?
2016-08-02 19:13:01	@Espyo	I might've said this before
2016-08-02 19:13:09	@Espyo	but I tried, multiple times, to go on the training stage, and flicking as far as possible
2016-08-02 19:13:16	@Espyo	I can't go any farther than like 3 lines
2016-08-02 19:13:26	@Espyo	and yet I see people online flicking ink at least twice that length
2016-08-02 19:13:37	@Espyo	this isn't a lag thing, or my perception being off because they're far away or anyhting
2016-08-02 19:13:39	@Espyo	*anything
2016-08-02 19:13:50	@Espyo	every single flick is super long, much longer than what happens on the training stage for me
2016-08-02 19:13:58	@Espyo	or even in-game, for the few times I tried bringing it online
2016-08-02 19:14:01	@Espyo	either there's some secret
2016-08-02 19:14:12	@Espyo	or... I don't even know what
2016-08-02 19:16:46	@PikFan	likely perception
2016-08-02 19:16:59	@PikFan	saltiness probably affects your perception
2016-08-02 19:17:04	Marty2000	Do you jump?
2016-08-02 19:17:08	Marty2000	while flicking?
2016-08-02 19:17:16	Marty2000	Jump+swim?
2016-08-02 19:18:26	Marty2000	Hmm, also, some people use Damage Ups so that you don't need to aim perfectly
2016-08-02 19:18:37	Marty2000	And, finally, it's lag
2016-08-02 19:18:58	Marty2000	When I kill a Dynamo, they always bring me into their grave
2016-08-02 19:19:04	Marty2000	Heh :p
2016-08-02 19:20:11	@Espyo	I jump
2016-08-02 19:20:15	@Espyo	not swim, though...
2016-08-02 19:20:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-02 19:23:23	Marty2000	Swimming can help increase the range, I think
2016-08-02 19:23:31	Marty2000	A little, though
2016-08-02 19:56:15	Yoshi2	Espyo: I showed the logs to another guy and he said "Why would somebody troll the BW community?"
2016-08-02 19:56:29	@Espyo	more or less what I said at one point
2016-08-02 19:57:36	Yoshi2	sooo the plan is as follows: no accusations (those are not fun), no glorification (get off the dev's dick goddamnit)
2016-08-02 19:58:07	Yoshi2	assume he is just a random person and see what he says about various topics
2016-08-02 20:00:18	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-02 20:01:34	Yoshi2	and he's "just" an executive producer so who knows how much involved he was in the details
2016-08-02 20:02:11	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-02 20:03:03	@Espyo	https://twitter.com/asutoroUmario/status/760465801543430146 WOAH
2016-08-02 20:04:24	Yoshi2	why do i feel like that wasn't very legit
2016-08-02 20:04:29	@Espyo	yeah, seems like a hack
2016-08-02 20:04:35	@Espyo	>Supposedly this glitch is actually just a hack from what I've heard on Twitter.
2016-08-02 20:05:10	@PikFan	no way
2016-08-02 20:05:16	@PikFan	that has to be fake
2016-08-02 20:05:29	@Espyo	yeah, its behavior has no business happening
2016-08-02 20:05:38	@Espyo	getting stuck on the Inkling, but falling down after the Inking moves, that'd be credible
2016-08-02 20:05:39	Marty2000	Nice
2016-08-02 20:05:45	@Espyo	but to follow it?
2016-08-02 20:06:01	Marty2000	asutoromario is a hacker
2016-08-02 20:06:07	Marty2000	He plays SPlatoon on CEMU, I think
2016-08-02 20:06:15	Marty2000	Let me find his channel
2016-08-02 20:06:34	@Espyo	ah

2016-08-02 20:06:50	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS2y1Fe1er8
2016-08-02 20:07:05	Marty2000	On a separate note, I think I saw him on the Splatoon Modding Hub thread
2016-08-02 20:08:20	@Espyo	neat
2016-08-02 20:08:39	@PikFan	oh, I saw a video where someone was using a moonjump hack
2016-08-02 20:08:44	@PikFan	my friend freaked out
2016-08-02 20:12:18	Yoshi2	Espyo: btw, you know how I keep complaining about crashes? It is caused by the game suddenly using more than twice the amount of ram it normally uses, and on my desktop with 32 bit vista and 3 gb of ram that is a problem
2016-08-02 20:12:35	Yoshi2	my hotfix for that is........... running the game on my notebook that has slightly more ram :|
2016-08-02 20:12:39	@Espyo	woah
2016-08-02 20:12:51	@Espyo	can you transfer the saves over?
2016-08-02 20:12:59	Yoshi2	yup, I can do that
2016-08-02 20:13:17	@Espyo	well, as long as it doesn't happen again, that will be good
2016-08-02 20:13:40	Yoshi2	suprisingly, I can share the game folder on the network and run the game on my notebook from the shared folder
2016-08-02 20:13:52	Yoshi2	no wasting space with installing it twice
2016-08-02 20:14:08	Yoshi2	it is slower though, but it works and I just need to get past the cutscene
2016-08-02 20:15:50	@Espyo	nice
2016-08-02 20:16:22	Yoshi2	sadly, this happened for the second time in a short while, which makes me not hopeful
2016-08-02 20:27:10	Yoshi2	this game has a bdsm-inspired character mess around with with the other, noticably younger characters :|
2016-08-02 20:27:21	Yoshi2	reminder that the game received a 12+ rating in germany
2016-08-02 20:27:30	@Espyo	...Germany
2016-08-02 20:27:40	@Espyo	the country that can't see a drawing of a weapon in a game without giving it AO
2016-08-02 20:28:00	@PikFan	political correctness to the max
2016-08-02 20:28:03	@PikFan	gross
2016-08-02 20:28:07	Yoshi2	of course, it's all in text and the real horrors are heavily implied and up to the perverted minds of the audience but still
2016-08-02 20:30:56	Yoshi2	it's all cutely drawn and stuff so it's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine https://i.imgur.com/5F0UMg1.jpg
2016-08-02 20:32:50	Yoshi2	this scene was maybe a minute or two of spoken dialogue, and it caused such memory leaks? :/

2016-08-02 20:36:12	@PikFan	though
2016-08-02 20:36:38	@PikFan	you could get 1 snail every day if you played enough
2016-08-02 20:36:40	@PikFan	maybe even 2
2016-08-02 20:37:27	Nikki89	>_> i haven't checked yet
2016-08-02 20:37:33	@PikFan	lol
2016-08-02 20:40:54	@PikFan	ooh
2016-08-02 20:41:10	@PikFan	I wonder if you have to pick up a snail before you can earn another one
2016-08-02 20:41:13	@PikFan	that would suck though
2016-08-02 20:41:31	@PikFan	cause you would win 60 battles but only get 1 snail
2016-08-02 20:41:41	@PikFan	hmm... should I try it?
2016-08-02 20:41:42	Marty2000	Let me try
2016-08-02 20:41:46	Marty2000	Or, try it
2016-08-02 20:41:51	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-02 20:41:58	@PikFan	how many battles have you already won
2016-08-02 20:42:09	Marty2000	Hmm... Since my last Snail, I'd say 5
2016-08-02 20:42:22	@PikFan	better start keeping track
2016-08-02 20:42:26	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-02 20:42:33	Marty2000	I'll keep track from 0 (as if I had not played)
2016-08-02 20:42:50	@PikFan	why?
2016-08-02 20:43:02	Marty2000	Because I'm not sure I won 5 battles
2016-08-02 20:43:09	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-02 20:43:11	Marty2000	I'm not exactly sure :p

2016-08-02 23:33:45	@PikFan	just curious, how's progress with Pikmin Forever?
2016-08-02 23:33:52	@PikFan	can't believe it's almost a year old...
2016-08-02 23:35:08	Scruffy	It actually is a year old, and a day
2016-08-02 23:35:52	Scruffy	I'm working on rendering all the piklopedia and metal index
2016-08-02 23:36:25	Scruffy	then I can create icons and fill in maps I make, thus completing the areas
2016-08-02 23:36:54	Scruffy	It's slow, and not entirely steady, but it's going
2016-08-02 23:37:18	@PikFan	wow
2016-08-02 23:37:27	@PikFan	well happy birthday Pikmin Forever!
2016-08-02 23:37:37	Scruffy	Heh, thank you
2016-08-02 23:37:39	@PikFan	happy late birthday, that is
2016-08-02 23:38:07	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-08-02 23:38:25	@PikFan	oh, were you ever going to make area previews for the other areas?
2016-08-02 23:38:32	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-02 23:38:42	Scruffy	But I'd like to fill in Daybreak Glade before doing that
2016-08-02 23:39:43	Scruffy	In Blender right now I've created a filled in map of Daybreak Glade, using just green circles for enemies, gray spheres for metal, and little fossil icons for fossils
2016-08-02 23:39:46	@PikFan	hmm, why's that? my mind would tell me to do the area previews first then do the actual maps
2016-08-02 23:40:09	Scruffy	I suppose that's true
2016-08-02 23:40:14	@PikFan	:P

2016-08-02 23:40:51	Scruffy	Thanks
2016-08-02 23:41:26	Scruffy	I was thinking that could work on its own, but I wanted to be more detailed so it'd be clear where everything is
2016-08-02 23:41:42	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2016-08-02 23:41:58	@PikFan	I want to draw maps of my areas, but all I have is ms paint :\

2016-08-02 23:42:32	Scruffy	It's only three layers, but the paint tool is very useful
2016-08-02 23:42:41	Scruffy	It's how I made this map
2016-08-02 23:43:05	Scruffy	Background was the outline, 1st layer was color, 2nd layer was shadows, 3rd layer was water bodies
2016-08-02 23:43:05	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2016-08-02 23:44:24	@PikFan	I bet GIMP would be useful in that aspect then
2016-08-02 23:44:32	@PikFan	(the layers, I mean)
2016-08-02 23:44:50	Scruffy	I thought it would, but it's just not terribly user-friendly
2016-08-02 23:45:11	Scruffy	And for this project in particular, I only needed 3 layers :P
2016-08-02 23:45:28	Scruffy	But you're right, I should finish these maps before I forget the process of making this one
2016-08-02 23:46:00	@PikFan	any program that has tons and tons of buttons to click on and things like that isn't bound to be user-friendly :P
2016-08-02 23:46:13	Scruffy	Yeah heh
2016-08-02 23:46:19	@PikFan	but yeah, I do remember that GIMP in particular had lots of buttons
2016-08-02 23:46:24	Scruffy	It just takes a lot of time to get used to, I guess
2016-08-02 23:46:45	Scruffy	But organization is key
2016-08-02 23:46:50	@PikFan	indeeed
2016-08-02 23:46:52	@PikFan	*-e
2016-08-02 23:46:59	Scruffy	I have the latest Photoshop as of a few weeks ago
2016-08-02 23:47:07	Scruffy	And the options are basically the same
2016-08-02 23:47:17	Scruffy	But having them organized differently makes a big difference
2016-08-02 23:49:10	Scruffy	Now I'm excited to start actually! :D
2016-08-02 23:49:25	Scruffy	But I can't just lump four older areas together anymore
2016-08-02 23:49:45	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-08-02 23:51:44	Scruffy	I'm not sure where to start
2016-08-02 23:54:04	@PikFan	hmm...
2016-08-02 23:54:20	@PikFan	well, why don't you start where the player would start, and go from there?
2016-08-02 23:54:44	Scruffy	That's multiple places though...
2016-08-02 23:54:51	@PikFan	heh, true
2016-08-02 23:54:59	Scruffy	Well, I guess I know one thing about the Scalding Thicket at least
2016-08-02 23:55:12	Scruffy	It's got to have a southern lake with Yellow Wollywogs
2016-08-02 23:55:29	@PikFan	wait, do you have multiple landing sites right from the very beginning of the game...?
2016-08-02 23:55:38	Scruffy	no, you have to discover them
2016-08-02 23:55:44	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-08-02 23:55:49	Scruffy	You'd start with one, so that helps I guess
2016-08-02 23:55:59	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I meant
2016-08-02 23:56:18	@PikFan	fill in the area as you'd explore like the player
2016-08-02 23:56:26	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-02 23:56:29	Scruffy	Neat
2016-08-02 23:56:41	Scruffy	Speaking of exploring like the player
2016-08-02 23:56:42	@PikFan	is that understandable...? :P
2016-08-02 23:56:44	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-02 23:56:48	@PikFan	hehe, okay
2016-08-02 23:57:09	Scruffy	Are you familiar with No Man's Sky?
2016-08-02 23:57:32	@PikFan	I've heard that it has 2 quintillion planets or something utterly insane like that
2016-08-02 23:57:39	Scruffy	18 quintillion
2016-08-02 23:57:54	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-02 23:58:05	@PikFan	isn't it procedurally-generated?
2016-08-02 23:58:15	Scruffy	Most likely the human race is not going to 100% it in its lifetime
2016-08-02 23:58:22	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-02 23:58:55	Scruffy	It comes out next week
2016-08-02 23:59:50	Scruffy	And before you know it we'll have a whole new codex of animals and plants named after dick jokes
2016-08-02 23:59:58	Scruffy	But honestly it does look really cool
2016-08-03 00:00:13	@PikFan	fun
2016-08-03 00:00:31	@PikFan	"By exploring, players gain information about the planets that they can submit to The Atlas, a universal database that can be shared with other players of the game."
2016-08-03 00:00:39	@PikFan	okay that is seriously really, really awesome
2016-08-03 00:00:49	@PikFan	it really is a collaborative effort
2016-08-03 00:00:50	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-03 00:01:06	@PikFan	it's... like they're wiki editors, in a way
2016-08-03 00:01:15	@PikFan	but it's so much more easier and simpler
2016-08-03 00:01:16	Marty2000	Nice
2016-08-03 00:01:24	Scruffy	and although it's very unlikely that you'll find other players, you can team up with them or compete with them
2016-08-03 00:01:39	Scruffy	And trade with them
2016-08-03 00:01:52	Marty2000	Looks cool
2016-08-03 00:02:07	Scruffy	I especially love the color work
2016-08-03 00:02:14	Scruffy	And I imagine the music will be great
2016-08-03 00:02:29	Scruffy	That's the type of gamer I am :P music and color first
2016-08-03 00:02:39	Scruffy	Then whether it's actually ufn
2016-08-03 00:02:41	Scruffy	fun*
2016-08-03 00:03:43	Scruffy	Which reminds me, have you heard of the independent game The Swapper, by any chance?
2016-08-03 00:04:09	@PikFan	no
2016-08-03 00:04:32	Scruffy	I think you'd enjoy it, it's very rooted in astronomy
2016-08-03 00:04:48	<--	Espyo (Espyo@2001:8a0:ebf8:pmhg:tslt:vum:kjip:wyiy) has quit (Quit: Leaving)

2016-08-03 00:04:58	Scruffy	And it succeeds in looking like everything was made of clay or found objects
2016-08-03 00:05:00	@PikFan	time to do math
2016-08-03 00:05:18	@PikFan	if the average galaxy has 100 billion planets...
2016-08-03 00:06:06	@PikFan	18 quintillion / 100 billion = 180 million
2016-08-03 00:06:07	@PikFan	wow
2016-08-03 00:06:11	@PikFan	that is a lot of galaxies
2016-08-03 00:06:22	Scruffy	yeah, and all to scale, from what I've heard
2016-08-03 00:06:42	@PikFan	so what, does the game begin generating more planets as the players explore the universe?
2016-08-03 00:07:00	Scruffy	I'm not sure
2016-08-03 00:07:18	Scruffy	There's no way it could keep track of all those planets at once
2016-08-03 00:07:47	Scruffy	So maybe it does work that way
2016-08-03 00:07:56	@PikFan	"Because of the size of this universe, Hello Games estimates that more than 99.9% of the planets will never be explored by players, and that the likelihood of meeting another player through chance encounters is nearly zero."
2016-08-03 00:07:58	@PikFan	._.
2016-08-03 00:08:29	@PikFan	...I bet they'll start hacking the game and putting in bots to discover as many planets as quickly as possible
2016-08-03 00:08:38	Scruffy	yeah, it's essentially space exploration without the actual threats of space
2016-08-03 00:08:39	Marty2000	Heh
2016-08-03 00:08:55	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-03 00:09:16	Marty2000	But the idea is interesting regardless
2016-08-03 00:09:32	Scruffy	Also, not every planet is explorable to begin with
2016-08-03 00:09:53	Scruffy	Some have unpalatable temperatures, radiation, dangerous creatures
2016-08-03 00:10:28	Scruffy	And it better not be that dying puts you somewhere random
2016-08-03 00:10:32	Scruffy	That'd be awful
2016-08-03 00:10:49	Scruffy	Or even at your original spawn point
2016-08-03 00:10:59	Scruffy	I can barely navigate in Minecraft
2016-08-03 00:11:05	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-03 00:11:16	@PikFan	I want to get Minecraft...
2016-08-03 00:11:24	@PikFan	too bad there's no cross-platform play :x
2016-08-03 00:11:34	Scruffy	I got it for free, and I don't remember how :/
2016-08-03 00:11:42	@PikFan	nice
2016-08-03 00:11:56	Scruffy	but I can't update it
2016-08-03 00:12:28	@PikFan	I'd like to get Minecraft for Wii U, but I've heard it's "inferior" to the other versions
2016-08-03 00:12:35	@PikFan	plus it doesn't even use the GamePad
2016-08-03 00:12:48	@PikFan	why do so many games underutilize the GamePad...

2016-08-03 00:13:34	Marty2000	No problem
2016-08-03 00:14:07	Neocraftz1553	Espyo added an Electric Dumple to the engine, or so it says on Github
2016-08-03 00:14:14	Scruffy	Man, people are just hatin' on the Wii U
2016-08-03 00:14:14	Scruffy	Probably because it's hard to program for
2016-08-03 00:14:14	Scruffy	Hi Neocraftz1553

2016-08-03 00:23:41	Neocraftz1553	I exited chrome with ny phone in my pocket 
2016-08-03 00:24:00	@PikFan	lel
2016-08-03 00:24:05	@PikFan	ooh, Scruffy
2016-08-03 00:24:16	@PikFan	what if we made an open world Pikmin game
2016-08-03 00:24:40	Scruffy	I'm listening...?
2016-08-03 00:24:49	@PikFan	and like
2016-08-03 00:24:58	@PikFan	no ships
2016-08-03 00:25:04	@PikFan	you're on the ground permanently
2016-08-03 00:25:10	@PikFan	so day and night
2016-08-03 00:25:22	@PikFan	but you have bases and such that are essentially "safe zones"
2016-08-03 00:25:49	@PikFan	but because of the open world concept, there aren't individual areas anymore
2016-08-03 00:26:01	@PikFan	it's just a big ole open world with different regions and subregions
2016-08-03 00:26:10	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-08-03 00:26:20	Scruffy	That sounds pretty cool
2016-08-03 00:26:31	@PikFan	and you can obtain the Pikmin in different orders
2016-08-03 00:26:51	Neocraftz1553	Like the Zelda for Wii U?
2016-08-03 00:26:56	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-03 00:27:17	@PikFan	I'm <s>stealing</s> borrowing a lot of ideas from Breath of the Wild
2016-08-03 00:27:20	Scruffy	yeah, that sounds pretty interesting
2016-08-03 00:27:25	@PikFan	just tuning it to make it Pikmin like ;)
2016-08-03 00:27:26	Scruffy	And you'd have a Piklopedia to fill
2016-08-03 00:27:30	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-03 00:27:34	@PikFan	and food to gather
2016-08-03 00:27:38	@PikFan	Louie would be so happy
2016-08-03 00:27:41	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-03 00:27:42	Neocraftz1553	Sounds cool
2016-08-03 00:27:53	@PikFan	you could carry the spoils back to your base
2016-08-03 00:27:54	Scruffy	Would you be the normal characters?
2016-08-03 00:28:00	Scruffy	Or would it be online?
2016-08-03 00:28:10	Scruffy	wait, never midn
2016-08-03 00:28:15	Scruffy	that would be too much
2016-08-03 00:28:20	@PikFan	I was thinking just the Pikmin sized captains, heh
2016-08-03 00:28:24	Scruffy	But would it be Olimar and Louie?
2016-08-03 00:28:32	@PikFan	it could be
2016-08-03 00:28:39	@PikFan	or it could be the Koppaites
2016-08-03 00:28:48	@PikFan	or it could be any new characters we decide to make
2016-08-03 00:29:07	@PikFan	but anyway, as I was saying
2016-08-03 00:29:09	Neocraftz1553	You could do something like the mii maker, only for captains
2016-08-03 00:29:22	@PikFan	when you carry spoils back to base, you have to decide what to do with them
2016-08-03 00:29:31	@PikFan	will you convert them into Pikmin seeds, like normal?
2016-08-03 00:29:42	@PikFan	or will you use them as food for the captains to eat?
2016-08-03 00:29:48	@PikFan	or will you use them as materials?
2016-08-03 00:29:49	@PikFan	etc
2016-08-03 00:30:09	@PikFan	that's essentially what Breath of the Wild wants you to do
2016-08-03 00:30:10	Neocraftz1553	Sounds like that one dwarf foretress hack I had/have
2016-08-03 00:30:28	@PikFan	but instead you have to carry the spoils back to base
2016-08-03 00:30:38	@PikFan	thing is, one base wouldn't be enough
2016-08-03 00:30:50	@PikFan	so, we can have multiple bases
2016-08-03 00:30:56	@PikFan	actually, you can even make your own base
2016-08-03 00:31:10	@PikFan	take any sufficiently empty space and claim it as your own
2016-08-03 00:31:44	Neocraftz1553	Or, you can work to flatten a space
2016-08-03 00:31:50	@PikFan	sure
2016-08-03 00:31:56	Neocraftz1553	The less pikmin you have, the more time it takes
2016-08-03 00:31:57	@PikFan	you can clear stuff out of it
2016-08-03 00:32:29	Scruffy	Neat
2016-08-03 00:32:45	Neocraftz1553	And get materials, no?
2016-08-03 00:32:45	@PikFan	how else could we make it Pikmin-like...?
2016-08-03 00:32:47	Scruffy	And you'd resources for things like building bridges, creating defenses, and such
2016-08-03 00:32:48	Neocraftz1553	Wood, stone
2016-08-03 00:32:56	@PikFan	oh, yes
2016-08-03 00:33:21	@PikFan	now I'm borrowing from your idea of moving things around, Scruffy :P
2016-08-03 00:33:33	Scruffy	Heh, no problem
2016-08-03 00:33:53	Scruffy	Also a few days ago when I wrote Olimar's notes for the Destructicore I invented a new idea
2016-08-03 00:33:58	Scruffy	Conditional notes
2016-08-03 00:33:58	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-08-03 00:34:03	@PikFan	oh, that
2016-08-03 00:34:10	@PikFan	yeah, that was a very neat idea
2016-08-03 00:34:14	Scruffy	Depending on how the battle for the item goes, Olimar says something different about it
2016-08-03 00:34:15	Neocraftz1553	What about events that can possibly destroy your bridges, walls, and such?
2016-08-03 00:34:27	@PikFan	those will definitely happen, yep
2016-08-03 00:34:31	Scruffy	Enemies would constantly be roaming around
2016-08-03 00:34:31	@PikFan	adds strategy
2016-08-03 00:34:50	Scruffy	There's got to be some over-arching goal though
2016-08-03 00:34:56	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-08-03 00:34:58	Neocraftz1553	Hmmm...
2016-08-03 00:35:24	Scruffy	Usually finding and retrieving all of something
2016-08-03 00:35:41	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-03 00:35:43	@PikFan	guys
2016-08-03 00:35:45	Neocraftz1553	What about some collectables, you know
2016-08-03 00:35:55	@PikFan	Pikmin 3 will be 3 years old in NA in 2 days
2016-08-03 00:36:03	Scruffy	Wow, yeah
2016-08-03 00:36:08	Neocraftz1553	Wow
2016-08-03 00:36:12	Neocraftz1553	How time flies
2016-08-03 00:36:26	Scruffy	I still play it today
2016-08-03 00:36:30	Scruffy	So much fun :D
2016-08-03 00:36:39	Neocraftz1553	I would, if I had it :p
2016-08-03 00:38:14	Neocraftz1553	I remember the Rock Pikmin and their blue flowers, when they were first announced
2016-08-03 00:39:15	Neocraftz1553	Hehe, imagine, Pikmin GO
2016-08-03 00:39:25	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2016-08-03 00:39:39	@PikFan	perhaps you'd be collecting energy cores...
2016-08-03 00:40:09	Scruffy	to power your death ray!
2016-08-03 00:40:10	@PikFan	say that there's some kind of technological colony on the ground
2016-08-03 00:40:15	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-03 00:40:22	Scruffy	There could be like a hub
2016-08-03 00:40:23	@PikFan	and it's under construction
2016-08-03 00:40:36	@PikFan	and they're bringing in the power source
2016-08-03 00:40:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-03 00:40:48	@PikFan	but, of course, something goes horribly wrong during the descent
2016-08-03 00:41:03	@PikFan	I mean, what Pikmin game doesn't have that cliche? :P
2016-08-03 00:41:08	Scruffy	Perhaps you have to collect as many batteries as you can
2016-08-03 00:41:09	Neocraftz1553	An asteroid crashes into your ship
2016-08-03 00:41:15	@PikFan	anyway, so
2016-08-03 00:41:27	@PikFan	the power source explodes into many different pieces
2016-08-03 00:41:36	@PikFan	and the goal is to collect all those pieces
2016-08-03 00:41:47	@PikFan	so the colony is the hub, yes
2016-08-03 00:41:54	Scruffy	Is there a time limit then?
2016-08-03 00:42:04	@PikFan	hmm... possibly...?
2016-08-03 00:42:11	Neocraftz1553	Not sure if it would work well, though...
2016-08-03 00:42:15	@PikFan	I'd rather not though
2016-08-03 00:42:28	@PikFan	I'd want the players to be able to explore freely...
2016-08-03 00:42:30	Neocraftz1553	I mean, I would like to explore an open world
2016-08-03 00:42:33	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-08-03 00:42:48	Neocraftz1553	Maybe add in a challenge mode like that?
2016-08-03 00:42:53	Neocraftz1553	 60 days
2016-08-03 00:43:01	Neocraftz1553	(In game)
2016-08-03 00:43:08	@PikFan	well, we could say that they just keep transporting things in
2016-08-03 00:43:27	@PikFan	though, that logic goes out of the window, since they could just as easily bring in a new power source.
2016-08-03 00:43:42	Neocraftz1553	Or, they have a renewable breathable air source
2016-08-03 00:43:52	@PikFan	ooh
2016-08-03 00:43:58	@PikFan	good idea
2016-08-03 00:44:09	Scruffy	Oh yeah, carbon scrubbing trees
2016-08-03 00:44:14	Scruffy	Er, oxygen scrubbing
2016-08-03 00:44:14	Neocraftz1553	I mean, the Koppaites breath oxygen, just in smaller amounts
2016-08-03 00:44:21	@PikFan	hm
2016-08-03 00:44:24	@PikFan	oh!
2016-08-03 00:44:28	Neocraftz1553	So, just oxygen reducers
2016-08-03 00:44:35	@PikFan	well, they wouldn't necessarily have to worry about power
2016-08-03 00:44:44	@PikFan	just use solar, hydro, wind, etc
2016-08-03 00:44:52	Neocraftz1553	The Hocotations, something like what Scruffy said
2016-08-03 00:45:05	@PikFan	but the energy obtained from those is just barely enough for them to get by
2016-08-03 00:45:08	Neocraftz1553	Maybe a plant from their planet
2016-08-03 00:45:17	Neocraftz1553	Hmmm....
2016-08-03 00:45:41	@PikFan	but then collecting all the power source fragments becomes moot
2016-08-03 00:45:42	Neocraftz1553	Maybe theres still a piece of the energy source left?
2016-08-03 00:45:42	@PikFan	sigh...
2016-08-03 00:46:06	Neocraftz1553	And thats enough to power lower-tech gear?
2016-08-03 00:46:18	Scruffy	I was thinking maybe something that isn't exactly necessary for the colony to exist, but still urgent
2016-08-03 00:46:19	Scruffy	like
2016-08-03 00:46:25	Neocraftz1553	Then as you collevt more, you unlock more stuff
2016-08-03 00:46:34	Neocraftz1553	Food?
2016-08-03 00:46:35	Scruffy	what about if there were missing persons?
2016-08-03 00:46:42	Neocraftz1553	Louie?
2016-08-03 00:46:44	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-03 00:46:48	Neocraftz1553	Louie and Food?
2016-08-03 00:47:02	@PikFan	now that you mention it, that reminds me of Xenoblade Chronicles X
2016-08-03 00:47:21	@PikFan	since I think you have to go and find the people in the stasis pods
2016-08-03 00:47:39	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-08-03 00:49:35	Neocraftz1553	Maybe you find new captains that way?
2016-08-03 00:49:42	Scruffy	I guess that's been done, looking for Louie in P2 and Charlie, Louie, and Olimar in P3
2016-08-03 00:50:05	@PikFan	hehe
2016-08-03 00:50:12	Scruffy	Oh yeah! I almost completely forgot I had an idea just like this that paved the way for Pikmin Forever
2016-08-03 00:50:16	Scruffy	it was called Mars
2016-08-03 00:50:46	 *	@PikFan is confused
2016-08-03 00:51:06	Neocraftz1553	Its a planet
2016-08-03 00:51:09	Scruffy	in which a crew of six alien scientists had to explore an Earth-like Mars to decide whether it was worth making a home there
2016-08-03 00:51:59	Scruffy	it took place a couple billion years from now, when the Sun swallows Earth but human influence reaches enough to put breathable air and a stable magnetosphere on Mars, kicking off evolution there
2016-08-03 00:52:33	@PikFan	hmm
2016-08-03 00:52:52	Scruffy	And then an alien race received messages humans had been sending, and traced it to our solar system finding Mars as a life-sustaining planet and assuming we lived there and were sending invitations
2016-08-03 00:53:09	@PikFan	so rather than collecting power source fragments, you're suggesting to find materials that are able to build the colony in the first placeS?
2016-08-03 00:53:14	@PikFan	*-S
2016-08-03 00:53:15	Scruffy	right
2016-08-03 00:53:23	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-03 00:53:27	Scruffy	there would be six crewmembers, each with a different purpose
2016-08-03 00:53:29	Scruffy	let's see
2016-08-03 00:53:46	Scruffy	Captain, cartographer, biologist, geologist, surveyor
2016-08-03 00:53:49	Scruffy	and...
2016-08-03 00:53:59	Neocraftz1553	Louie.
2016-08-03 00:54:06	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-03 00:54:10	Scruffy	I can't remember the last one
2016-08-03 00:54:25	Neocraftz1553	Botanist? 
2016-08-03 00:54:34	Scruffy	That's part of biologist
2016-08-03 00:54:39	Neocraftz1553	Hmm...
2016-08-03 00:55:17	Neocraftz1553	Scientist? Hmm...
2016-08-03 00:55:50	@PikFan	architect?
2016-08-03 00:55:56	Neocraftz1553	Medic?
2016-08-03 00:56:19	@PikFan	there's gotta be someone who's able to build things
2016-08-03 00:56:26	Scruffy	I think it was closer to architect, but medic sounds like a better idea
2016-08-03 00:56:27	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-08-03 00:57:13	@PikFan	oh, mechanic
2016-08-03 00:57:15	@PikFan	there we go
2016-08-03 00:57:17	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-03 00:57:19	Scruffy	That was it
2016-08-03 00:57:21	@PikFan	that's what I was thinking of
2016-08-03 00:57:24	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-08-03 00:57:35	Neocraftz1553	So if the ship breaks down, you know
2016-08-03 00:57:48	Scruffy	Or if any structures they build break down
2016-08-03 00:58:00	Scruffy	Mining equipment, water purifiers, defenses
2016-08-03 00:58:24	Scruffy	It was such a fruitful idea because I had to invent my own new tree of life
2016-08-03 00:58:26	@PikFan	though, I feel that you could combine biologist with geologist, and combine surveyor with cartographer
2016-08-03 00:58:34	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-08-03 00:58:36	@PikFan	but it's fine if they stay separate
2016-08-03 00:58:42	Scruffy	Cartographer was also co-captain
2016-08-03 00:58:55	Neocraftz1553	Oh
2016-08-03 00:58:59	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-08-03 00:59:00	Scruffy	And the surveyor was separate so he could eventually become an antagonist
2016-08-03 00:59:07	Scruffy	But it never got off the ground
2016-08-03 00:59:11	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-03 00:59:20	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok, I was confused why there was both of dem
2016-08-03 00:59:26	Scruffy	I lost most of the artwork and material I had drawn/written for it
2016-08-03 00:59:35	@PikFan	oh, that sucks :(
2016-08-03 00:59:39	Neocraftz1553	Aw, that sucks 
2016-08-03 00:59:52	@PikFan	well, perhaps they'll be revived in this project
2016-08-03 00:59:55	Scruffy	Except for a rendering and description of the final boss
2016-08-03 01:00:04	Scruffy	Which is not Pikmin-friendly, I assure you
2016-08-03 01:00:11	Neocraftz1553	Kewl
2016-08-03 01:00:12	@PikFan	oh?
2016-08-03 01:00:20	@PikFan	how is it not Pikmin friendly :P
2016-08-03 01:00:29	@PikFan	is it like fierce and vicious
2016-08-03 01:00:36	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-03 01:00:39	Neocraftz1553	Oh, we can get by with a T rated Pikmin game, dont worry :p
2016-08-03 01:00:54	Neocraftz1553	Or an M rated one....
2016-08-03 01:00:56	Scruffy	Firstly, it's a giant jet black snake-like creature
2016-08-03 01:01:06	Neocraftz1553	Or an A.... actually no
2016-08-03 01:01:14	@PikFan	is the eye the weakpoint :P
2016-08-03 01:01:23	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-03 01:01:42	Scruffy	Actually high-voltage electricity was
2016-08-03 01:01:47	Scruffy	But that was about it
2016-08-03 01:01:56	Neocraftz1553	Get the PLUNGERS!!!
2016-08-03 01:02:14	Scruffy	It also was evolved to predict where its prey /would/ go
2016-08-03 01:02:14	Neocraftz1553	just came to my head 
2016-08-03 01:02:28	Scruffy	And could turn invisible
2016-08-03 01:02:34	Neocraftz1553	Hmmm....
2016-08-03 01:02:38	@PikFan	woah
2016-08-03 01:03:08	Neocraftz1553	So it would follow you around the world/map/area, even if you didn't notice it at first
2016-08-03 01:03:13	Neocraftz1553	-?
2016-08-03 01:03:36	Scruffy	It has adhesive tentacles in its mandible, to prevent bitten prey from escaping
2016-08-03 01:03:48	Scruffy	As well as a row of venomous fangs
2016-08-03 01:03:52	@PikFan	wowza
2016-08-03 01:03:57	Neocraftz1553	aka, a tongue :p
2016-08-03 01:04:05	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-08-03 01:04:22	Scruffy	And finally it could eject stomach acids when threatened
2016-08-03 01:04:43	Neocraftz1553	It, sorta makea me thing of a Pikmin Boss
2016-08-03 01:05:01	Neocraftz1553	Just make it E-rated game friendly, and boom
2016-08-03 01:05:08	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-03 01:05:23	Scruffy	This was also the game where I first thought of the Lipidon
2016-08-03 01:05:34	Scruffy	Its look was not too different from how it looks now
2016-08-03 01:05:41	Neocraftz1553	Wow, so alot of the same concepts
2016-08-03 01:06:05	Scruffy	A big carapace of fat that it stores as nutrients
2016-08-03 01:06:35	Neocraftz1553	It seems like it would be weak to heat, no?
2016-08-03 01:07:19	Scruffy	There was also an element called nutrium, the ultimate universal supporter of life
2016-08-03 01:07:19	Scruffy	And rudimentary organisms that grew from it called life specks
2016-08-03 01:07:19	Scruffy	Aww, this is all flowing back to me now
2016-08-03 01:08:43	Scruffy	This was also where the Acrylic Daycrawler came from, under a different name
2016-08-03 01:09:18	Scruffy	Anyway, sorry to take things off-topic
2016-08-03 01:09:33	Scruffy	Let's get back to this open-world Pikmin game
2016-08-03 01:09:36	@PikFan	oh, no
2016-08-03 01:09:41	@PikFan	that's totally fine
2016-08-03 01:10:04	@PikFan	perhaps we could incorporate those into the game somehow...
2016-08-03 01:10:35	@PikFan	say that while you're running around gathering materials and such, you begin learning about the planet's history
2016-08-03 01:10:51	@PikFan	and you discover that the planet is in a decline of nutrium
2016-08-03 01:11:25	Scruffy	hehe
2016-08-03 01:11:39	Scruffy	I'm not sure we should spring that on the Pikmin storyline all of a sudden
2016-08-03 01:11:52	@PikFan	true
2016-08-03 01:11:54	Scruffy	Pikmin seems to relish easily recognizable natural phenomena
2016-08-03 01:12:11	@PikFan	right
2016-08-03 01:12:16	@PikFan	it's all about the nature
2016-08-03 01:12:20	@PikFan	and always has been
2016-08-03 01:12:26	Scruffy	yeah
2016-08-03 01:12:44	Scruffy	Even the Pikmin have a real-world flower on their heads
2016-08-03 01:13:33	Scruffy	So whatever problem arises, should be a result of a natural occurrence or a Hocotate/Koppai problem
2016-08-03 01:15:59	Scruffy	what if colonies on PNF-404 are already flourishing, and you have some ulterior research mission?
2016-08-03 01:16:21	Scruffy	Like, collecting stone samples?
2016-08-03 01:16:30	@PikFan	hmm, perhaps
2016-08-03 01:16:36	Scruffy	not as exciting, I suppose...
2016-08-03 01:16:39	@PikFan	but there has to be an interesting twist to it
2016-08-03 01:16:45	@PikFan	seems rather... bland
2016-08-03 01:16:45	Scruffy	right
2016-08-03 01:17:31	Neocraftz1553	I dunno
2016-08-03 01:18:45	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure, but I think it would be cool if you could do what ever you want with it, like, if you want to collect stone, go ahead
2016-08-03 01:19:00	Neocraftz1553	Want to fill up a Piklopedia? Why not 
2016-08-03 01:19:17	Scruffy	Perhaps you are just filling a research job, when suddenly...
2016-08-03 01:19:27	Neocraftz1553	BAM!
2016-08-03 01:19:38	Scruffy	...your colony is severely damaged and you have to figure out why?
2016-08-03 01:19:46	Scruffy	...people have gone missing?
2016-08-03 01:20:02	Scruffy	...random objects have been sapped of color? :P
2016-08-03 01:20:20	@PikFan	lolno
2016-08-03 01:20:22	Neocraftz1553	Sounds like color splash, sorta
2016-08-03 01:20:34	@PikFan	(that was the intent :P)
2016-08-03 01:20:36	Neocraftz1553	Actually...
2016-08-03 01:20:39	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-08-03 01:20:42	Scruffy	Actually I was considering for a while making Pikmin Color Splash a game on Fanon
2016-08-03 01:20:50	@PikFan	oh yeah!
2016-08-03 01:20:58	@PikFan	how was that video coming along?
2016-08-03 01:21:04	Scruffy	Laughably slow
2016-08-03 01:21:12	Neocraftz1553	Which one?
2016-08-03 01:21:13	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-08-03 01:21:16	Scruffy	I got animated sprites for Olimar and Alph
2016-08-03 01:21:19	Scruffy	But that's it
2016-08-03 01:21:25	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-08-03 01:21:30	@PikFan	well, I'm not sure many people were clamoring for it anyway...
2016-08-03 01:21:35	@PikFan	low demand = low supply
2016-08-03 01:21:40	Scruffy	If I really want to do anything with it, I need to map their movements to keystrokes
2016-08-03 01:21:49	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, what happened to that Pikmin Kart video you were making
2016-08-03 01:21:53	Scruffy	And by that point, I should just make it a game
2016-08-03 01:22:02	Neocraftz1553	Heh, true
2016-08-03 01:22:18	Scruffy	Let's just imagine that I have a lot of ideas but either forget I'm doing them, am too busy, or get laaaazy
2016-08-03 01:22:48	Scruffy	I finished all the karts but didn't go past that
2016-08-03 01:22:49	 *	Neocraftz1553 imagines
2016-08-03 01:23:05	Neocraftz1553	Oh
2016-08-03 01:23:19	@PikFan	for me, it's mainly laziness :P
2016-08-03 01:23:20	Scruffy	Making the actual track was a bit daunting
2016-08-03 01:23:22	@PikFan	no motivation
2016-08-03 01:23:40	Scruffy	And all the characters and their animations
2016-08-03 01:23:43	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, no motivation is a big one for me
2016-08-03 01:24:04	Scruffy	Again, if I'm going to do that, I ought to just make a game out of an original idea :P
2016-08-03 01:24:06	Neocraftz1553	Animations... not sure how to render them.
2016-08-03 01:24:21	Scruffy	you just have to keyframe certain parts of an armature
2016-08-03 01:24:29	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, but rendering
2016-08-03 01:24:45	Scruffy	Select "Render Animation" rather than "Render Image"
2016-08-03 01:24:47	Neocraftz1553	I animated a Rock Pikmin once...
2016-08-03 01:24:53	Scruffy	It should be right under the latter
2016-08-03 01:24:59	@PikFan	hmm
2016-08-03 01:25:00	Neocraftz1553	OH, IM SO STUPID XD
2016-08-03 01:25:12	Neocraftz1553	thats why
2016-08-03 01:25:16	@PikFan	well, hopefully if I get an actual desktop someday
2016-08-03 01:25:20	Scruffy	Make sure in "Output" under render settings you set what you want it to be
2016-08-03 01:25:30	@PikFan	I can let you use it Scruffy :P
2016-08-03 01:25:40	@PikFan	it should be able to render much, much faster
2016-08-03 01:25:53	Scruffy	If it's an image file, Blender will dump the frames as images wherever you choose
2016-08-03 01:26:09	Scruffy	That's good because you can easily plug them back into Blender to make a video file
2016-08-03 01:26:20	Neocraftz1553	Ah,I see
2016-08-03 01:26:29	Scruffy	Or, you can have Blender export it as a video file, but then you won't be able to preview it until it's done
