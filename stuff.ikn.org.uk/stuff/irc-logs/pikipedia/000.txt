2013-10-06 16:21:43	@J	...okay, why, in my test 'game', do I have an input that activates on double-click events from a gamepad A-stick?
2013-10-06 16:21:59	Espyo	pffffffffffttttt
2013-10-06 16:22:15	Espyo	you could have it like in the Kirby games
2013-10-06 16:22:21	Espyo	a double-smash means a dash
2013-10-06 16:22:27	Espyo	well... I know that's true for the D-Pad
2013-10-06 16:22:38	Espyo	but it COULD be the same for the recent games, that use analog sticks
2013-10-06 16:23:03	Espyo	in Smash Bros (made by HAL, creators of Kirby, and it /shows/), you dash by smashing the analog stick, so maybe in recent Kirby games you also dash by smashing
2013-10-06 16:23:10	Espyo	but you could also dash by double-tapping
2013-10-06 16:24:15	Espyo	now, I wanna take screenshots of the areas
2013-10-06 16:24:25	Espyo	and I want to make the angles of the camera and whatnot diverse
2013-10-06 16:24:27	Espyo	because diversity
2013-10-06 16:24:38	Espyo	but it's gonna be obvious that I have the same number of Pikmin on the field at all times
2013-10-06 16:25:01	Espyo	because I can't take the time to go back and put Pikmin on an Onion or take them out for the sake of diversity
2013-10-06 16:25:10	Espyo	also it'll always be on day 11 (Pikmin 1 at least)
2013-10-06 16:25:32	Espyo	so my plans for diversity are gonna fall a bit short
2013-10-06 16:26:27	Espyo	gleh, better than nothing
2013-10-06 16:26:28	Espyo	let's go
2013-10-06 16:27:59	@J	doesn't really matter
2013-10-06 16:28:13	@J	also, this is what my test game has ended up looking like:
2013-10-06 16:28:13	@J	http://i.imgur.com/0JioXHG.png
2013-10-06 16:28:27	Espyo	it's an abstract form of gaming
2013-10-06 16:28:43	@J	just be happy you're not seeing it in motion
2013-10-06 16:28:48	Espyo	and I can see I'm going to have to restart my computer
2013-10-06 16:28:49	Espyo	...sigh

2013-10-06 16:31:06	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-10-06 16:33:23	@J	I like how I have this 'button4' event, which just means it maps to 4 buttons (usually directions),
2013-10-06 16:33:35	@J	and I can just change the type to 'axis2', without changing any of the inputs
2013-10-06 16:33:39	@J	and it just works
2013-10-06 16:33:54	@J	every input can work for a button4 or an axis2 without changes
2013-10-06 16:35:00	-->	Espyo (Mibbit@t12-482-53-10.cpe.netcabo.pt) has joined #pikipedia
2013-10-06 16:35:29	Espyo	well, I'm an idiot
2013-10-06 16:35:39	Espyo	the capture card was connected to the Wii, not the GC
2013-10-06 16:35:49	Espyo	still, knowing windows, I'd probably need a restart anyway
2013-10-06 16:35:53	Espyo	also axis are very weird
2013-10-06 16:36:07	Espyo	either that, or this controller I have, which is the only one that actually works now, is weird
2013-10-06 16:37:07	@J	wait
2013-10-06 16:37:08	@J	...
2013-10-06 16:37:12	@J	I thought Testyo was you
2013-10-06 16:37:20	@J	well, what I said wasn't that important anyway
2013-10-06 16:37:45	@J	oh
2013-10-06 16:37:52	@J	I see you still saw what I said?
2013-10-06 16:38:43	Espyo	Testyo is me
2013-10-06 16:38:46	Espyo	I read what you wrote
2013-10-06 16:38:55	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-06 16:39:02	Espyo	also I need to wait for the capture card to warm up or something
2013-10-06 16:39:14	Espyo	the first few minutes of recording are always very dragged out and laggy
2013-10-06 16:39:27	@J	also, I didn't know you had a capture card
2013-10-06 16:39:28	Espyo	if I leave it recording for a while, it eventually shapes up
2013-10-06 16:39:37	Espyo	...what
2013-10-06 16:41:01	Espyo	I think you commented on some of my cave screenshot uploads
2013-10-06 16:41:03	Espyo	like this one http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Cave_of_Snarls.jpg
2013-10-06 16:41:06	Espyo	don't remember what you said, though
2013-10-06 16:44:52	@J	no idea
2013-10-06 16:45:01	@J	I note you overwrote an old image there, though
2013-10-06 16:45:21	@J	yours is kind of blurry
2013-10-06 16:45:46	@J	...if your comment is 'no border', why didn't you just crop the old one?
2013-10-06 16:47:36	Espyo	I think I wanted all pictures to look the same
2013-10-06 16:47:43	Espyo	and half of them were just snapshots with a camera

2013-10-06 22:11:57	@J	the galleries are kind of huge
2013-10-06 22:12:24	Espyo	noticed that as well
2013-10-06 22:12:30	Espyo	thought I guess it's better to have them chunky
2013-10-06 22:12:33	Espyo	they're relevant, at least
2013-10-06 22:12:44	Espyo	also you apparently haven't seen the Smash 4 article on SmashWiki
2013-10-06 22:12:52	@J	well, I'm still not sure you need all of every area, but
2013-10-06 22:13:12	@J	it's good to have it just as a kind of record
2013-10-06 22:13:13	@J	I guess
2013-10-06 22:13:20	Espyo	rather, articleS
2013-10-06 22:13:28	@J	just makes it feel complete, I should say
2013-10-06 22:13:48	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Area_images would've been nice

2013-10-07 18:36:05	Espyo	great, now I don't even know if it worked
2013-10-07 18:52:32	@J	why does it keep disconnecting me?
2013-10-07 18:52:37	@J	I only got here right now
2013-10-07 18:52:54	@J	if memo only tells you when you join, I guess that won't work for me any more
2013-10-07 18:53:04	@J	but it should if it tells you when you next say something
2013-10-07 18:53:18	@J	I'll look at the thing after food
2013-10-07 18:59:22	@J	does it say why I disconnected, BTW?
2013-10-07 19:03:08	Espyo	that's just it
2013-10-07 19:03:23	Espyo	I took the liberty of changing your settings to make Testyo give you the memo when you said something
2013-10-07 19:03:29	Espyo	because you were already connected
2013-10-07 19:03:38	Espyo	also the reason is a ping timeout, and you only disconnected once today
2013-10-07 19:07:59	@J	it says I joined at 6 and 6:35
2013-10-07 19:08:09	@J	following disconnects
2013-10-07 19:08:57	Espyo	well, we had a netsplit at 12:25, until 12:27
2013-10-07 19:09:15	Espyo	but since then, you only disconnected at 17:48, and joined at 18:35
2013-10-07 19:10:31	@J	okay then
2013-10-07 19:10:37	@J	so one was a phantom connect
2013-10-07 19:10:42	@J	that's quite a long time

2013-10-07 19:11:51	@J	did I join in the middle of another netsplit?
2013-10-07 19:12:00	Espyo	that makes no sense
2013-10-07 19:13:06	@J	I joined at 6 and I was the only one here
2013-10-07 19:13:29	Espyo	the netsplit was fixed on everybody's end automatically
2013-10-07 19:13:34	Espyo	...and it happened at midday
2013-10-07 19:15:40	Espyo	and now I'm gonna shower
2013-10-07 20:01:44	@J	forgot to look at the thing
2013-10-07 20:02:07	@J	looks like a thing, I guess
2013-10-07 20:02:40	@J	are GIFs normally that large when so short/small/low-framerate?
2013-10-07 20:02:55	Espyo	...large?
2013-10-07 20:02:58	@J	filesize
2013-10-07 20:03:00	Espyo	I'm surprised it was sub 1MB
2013-10-07 20:03:03	@J	really?
2013-10-07 20:03:06	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-07 20:03:11	Espyo	I've seen gifs that go to 3MB
2013-10-07 20:03:18	Espyo	and even then I don't feel like they're really titani

2013-10-07 20:03:23	@J	hmm
2013-10-07 20:03:52	Espyo	anyway, gonna make the Pikmin 2 one now
2013-10-07 20:03:58	Espyo	the daylight changes differently
2013-10-07 20:04:12	Espyo	also there's a point at 13:15 or so where the light is very bright
2013-10-07 20:04:16	Espyo	lasts only for a few minutes
2013-10-07 20:06:57	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/time.gif
2013-10-07 20:07:01	@J	well, that's a little better
2013-10-07 20:07:24	@J	a 'point at 13:15' that lasts for a few minutes?
2013-10-07 20:07:54	Espyo	 13:15 in-game hours
2013-10-07 20:08:06	@J	oh, a few minutes in-game time too?
2013-10-07 20:08:20	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-07 20:08:23	@J	right
2013-10-07 20:08:25	Espyo	what'd you change on that gif?
2013-10-07 20:08:49	@J	made it smaller
2013-10-07 20:09:56	Espyo	oh, right
2013-10-07 20:09:56	Espyo	...how
2013-10-07 20:10:18	@J	I found a thing called gifsicle
2013-10-07 20:10:32	Espyo	ah
2013-10-07 20:10:40	Espyo	guess GIMP isn't the best optimizer in the world
2013-10-07 20:10:48	Espyo	Pikmin 2 image incoming, compress it too, if you please
2013-10-07 20:12:22	@J	I already uninstalled it

2013-10-07 20:13:35	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/time2.gif
2013-10-07 20:13:51	@J	it's weird that it's so big still, though
2013-10-07 20:14:01	@J	I mean, it's only 25 frames, and they're small, and indexed
2013-10-07 20:14:34	Espyo	better than nothign
2013-10-07 20:14:36	Espyo	*nothing
2013-10-07 20:14:40	Espyo	better than a full video
2013-10-07 20:14:48	Espyo	ok, so I'll be saving these to add to the [[day]] article, once I get to it
2013-10-07 20:15:30	@J	also, the optimisation seems to have done this weird thing where each frame is placed on top of the previous one
2013-10-07 20:15:34	@J	so some just have gaps
2013-10-07 20:15:37	@J	like a diff
2013-10-07 20:15:47	Espyo	oh, that's a very common thing
2013-10-07 20:15:53	Espyo	in fact, I was hoping GIMP'd do that
2013-10-07 20:15:55	Espyo	it said it would
2013-10-07 20:15:56	Espyo	but it didn't

2013-10-07 20:47:31	Espyo	gonna start the article now

2013-10-07 20:48:06	Espyo	how would I even start the opening paragraph?
2013-10-07 20:48:08	@J	or are you merging it?
2013-10-07 20:48:10	Espyo	Sunset'll be merged into day
2013-10-07 20:48:14	Espyo	no point in having both, really
2013-10-07 20:48:16	@J	yeah
2013-10-07 20:48:17	Espyo	unless...
2013-10-07 20:48:19	Espyo	the Final Smash...
2013-10-07 20:48:29	Espyo	*shrug*, it'll be merged too
2013-10-07 20:49:24	@J	I don't know, just say Pikmin games are made up of days which are x minutes long and that stuff changes during and between days
2013-10-07 20:49:39	@J	then the rest of the article is a list of mechanics
2013-10-07 20:49:53	@J	and maybe also mention day limits in the intro

2013-10-07 21:38:01	Miles	Good question
2013-10-07 21:38:03	Miles	What is me
2013-10-07 21:39:28	Espyo	never quite got that expression
2013-10-07 21:39:31	Espyo	"what is X"
2013-10-07 21:39:32	Miles	Pikmin 3 is 7 Days for reaching the credits and 10 Days for collecting all fruit
2013-10-07 21:39:36	Espyo	used to reply to questions like J's
2013-10-07 21:39:47	Espyo	anyway, 7, got it
2013-10-07 21:39:51	Espyo	wait...
2013-10-07 21:39:54	Espyo	no, it should be 10
2013-10-07 21:40:03	Espyo	in Pikmin 2, the runs are mostly for all treasures
2013-10-07 21:40:08	Espyo	hm
2013-10-07 21:40:11	Espyo	or I can just mention both
2013-10-07 21:40:14	Miles	Well, it's not like Pikmin 2
2013-10-07 21:40:21	Miles	Where the game continues post-credits
2013-10-07 21:40:25	Espyo	what's the minimum number of days to repay the debt in?
2013-10-07 21:40:30	Miles	Once you reach the credits, game's over
2013-10-07 21:40:40	Miles	And you have to go back in time to collect the remaining fruit
2013-10-07 21:40:40	Espyo	ah
2013-10-07 21:41:13	Miles	I think 3 Days

2013-10-07 22:21:50	Espyo	...well, says 5 according to the 7-day run
2013-10-07 22:22:02	Espyo	but there's no run that can make just the debt repayment faster
2013-10-07 22:22:03	Espyo	...right?
2013-10-07 22:23:28	@J	yeah, you just replay caves for Pokos from enemies
2013-10-07 22:24:00	@J	didn't know you could do it in 3, though
2013-10-07 22:24:06	@J	just 4
2013-10-07 22:24:08	<--	UltraMario (Mibbit@q-04-054-524-534.hsd4.pa.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2013-10-07 22:24:13	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-07 22:24:23	Espyo	but an Emergence Cave run takes 16 days or so
2013-10-07 22:24:31	@J	no, not Emergence Cave
2013-10-07 22:24:33	Espyo	are there any caves that are a lot richer and can be farmed over and over?
2013-10-07 22:24:47	@J	Snagret Hole, Cave of Spiders, I think
2013-10-07 22:24:56	Espyo	hm
2013-10-07 22:25:28	@J	plus you can do more in AW day 3 than you would normally do
2013-10-07 22:25:36	@J	you just don't bother because you're coming back anyway
2013-10-07 22:25:42	@J	as I say, SH on day 3
2013-10-07 22:26:10	-->	UltraMario (Mibbit@q-04-054-524-534.hsd4.pa.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2013-10-07 22:26:30	Espyo	fair enough
2013-10-07 22:30:28	Miles	Yeah, paying the debt off in 3 Days is just revisiting Snagret Hole over and over and over
2013-10-07 22:32:01	Espyo	I see
2013-10-07 22:32:04	Espyo	we should have an article on that
2013-10-07 22:42:33	@J	a whole article?
2013-10-07 22:44:25	Espyo	I was thinking that
2013-10-07 22:44:30	Espyo	rather
2013-10-07 22:44:35	Espyo	I was thinking ABOUT that
2013-10-07 22:44:46	Espyo	I think a section on the 7-day article would be the best idea
2013-10-07 22:47:49	Espyo	dammit
2013-10-07 22:47:56	Espyo	Espyo's epic hour formats strike again
2013-10-07 22:48:14	Espyo	when I'm not saying disasters like "22 AM"...
2013-10-07 22:48:18	Espyo	I just said 4:AM in another network
2013-10-07 22:48:29	Espyo	that's why I don't work without a 24-hour format
2013-10-07 22:50:04	UltraMario	does this wiki upload themes
2013-10-07 22:50:25	UltraMario	i found a good quality S.S. Drake from YouTube
2013-10-07 22:50:39	@J	what is '4:AM' even meant to mean?
2013-10-07 22:50:39	Espyo	"upload"?
2013-10-07 22:50:45	Espyo	I think I meant 4 AM
2013-10-07 22:50:47	UltraMario	yes
2013-10-07 22:50:48	Espyo	and 4:00 combined
2013-10-07 22:50:51	Espyo	and ended up making a monster
2013-10-07 22:50:58	UltraMario	like yknow
2013-10-07 22:51:07	UltraMario	kinda like images
2013-10-07 22:51:24	Espyo	not sure if it does
2013-10-07 22:51:25	Espyo	J?
2013-10-07 22:51:34	@J	no idea what you mean
2013-10-07 22:51:43	UltraMario	hmm
2013-10-07 22:52:01	UltraMario	if not you should be able to link YT vids atleast
2013-10-07 22:52:20	Espyo	you mean graphical layout?
2013-10-07 22:52:34	Espyo	or audio theme, a leitmotif?
2013-10-07 22:52:56	UltraMario	audio theme lol
2013-10-07 22:53:06	UltraMario	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNb0xEXQPY&list=SPz5gUls4mkX8JUFzdNYPyF5Rudaz3rVQk
2013-10-07 22:53:17	@J	oh, theme music
2013-10-07 22:53:27	UltraMario	reminds me of SMG...
2013-10-07 22:53:44	@J	we host some Pikmin music for use in articles
2013-10-07 22:53:53	UltraMario	oh giid
2013-10-07 22:53:54	Espyo	see, we discussed a new graphical layout recently
2013-10-07 22:53:58	Espyo	hence the confusion
2013-10-07 22:54:00	Espyo	but yeah
2013-10-07 22:54:02	UltraMario	*good
2013-10-07 22:54:05	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Audio
2013-10-07 22:54:07	Espyo	check [[Awakening Good]] and such
2013-10-07 22:54:13	@J	...nice link
2013-10-07 22:54:14	Espyo	for syntax on how to add an audio file
2013-10-07 22:54:20	Espyo	...[[Awakening Wood]]
2013-10-07 22:54:27	UltraMario	fuck i cant actually upload tho
2013-10-07 22:54:28	@J	but just samples, not full files
2013-10-07 22:54:30	Espyo	I think you mean "good link"
2013-10-07 22:54:31	UltraMario	wii u
2013-10-07 22:54:40	Espyo	in fact, we still need to discuss samples vs whole
2013-10-07 22:54:45	Espyo	I wrote it on the ToDo
2013-10-07 22:54:51	Espyo	on other wikis, they use the whole files
2013-10-07 22:54:57	UltraMario	Yes
2013-10-07 22:55:00	@J	because they don't care for legality
2013-10-07 22:55:09	UltraMario	yees
2013-10-07 22:56:29	Espyo	do we?
2013-10-07 22:56:32	Espyo	we have textures all over the place
2013-10-07 22:56:45	Espyo	besides, with SOPA version 75.4, even screenshots are bad
2013-10-07 22:56:52	Espyo	(it's probably on version 75.4 by now)
2013-10-07 22:56:55	@J	hmm
2013-10-07 22:57:12	@J	textures are a little different, but I don't really like hosting loads of those either
2013-10-07 22:57:17	Espyo	...that was kinda jokey, but thinking back to it
2013-10-07 22:57:20	Espyo	it really isn't
2013-10-07 22:57:26	Espyo	I remember now that they wanted to ban gameplay videos
2013-10-07 22:57:33	Espyo	what's so different between that and a screenshot?
2013-10-07 22:57:47	Espyo	I don't like hosting a lot of copyrighted material either, but
2013-10-07 22:58:00	Espyo	(says the guy who's making a Pikmin fangame engine that uses a lot of stuff from the original games)
2013-10-07 22:58:08	@J	it does?
2013-10-07 22:58:18	Espyo	textures, for one thing
2013-10-07 22:58:25	Espyo	I sure as hell am not gonna make my own
2013-10-07 22:58:28	Espyo	also audio files, mostly
2013-10-07 22:58:31	Espyo	music, I guess I could make my own
2013-10-07 22:58:38	Espyo	I /want/ to start composing eventually
2013-10-07 22:58:43	@J	hmm, really?  I thought it was more of a low-res style with pixel-y sprites
2013-10-07 22:58:46	Espyo	but at least the terrain textures will be ripped
2013-10-07 22:58:50	Espyo	the sprites, yeah
2013-10-07 22:58:54	Espyo	but the textures...
2013-10-07 22:58:56	Espyo	I mean...
2013-10-07 22:58:59	Espyo	I could make my own, no sweat
2013-10-07 22:59:05	Espyo	but I find the contrast kinda good
2013-10-07 22:59:09	@J	do you not get a weird contrast with 'realistic' -
2013-10-07 22:59:13	@J	yeah
2013-10-07 22:59:15	@J	really?
2013-10-07 22:59:22	Espyo	...oh, have you seen any WIP that uses textures on the background?
2013-10-07 22:59:31	@J	WIP game?
2013-10-07 22:59:31	Espyo	WIP video
2013-10-07 22:59:34	@J	oh
2013-10-07 22:59:35	Espyo	of my engine
2013-10-07 22:59:36	@J	no
2013-10-07 22:59:37	Espyo	sorry, wasn't specific
2013-10-07 22:59:44	Espyo	in that case, I'm very late for a new update
2013-10-07 22:59:47	@J	wait
2013-10-07 22:59:48	Espyo	gimme a sec
2013-10-07 22:59:49	@J	maybe I did?
2013-10-07 22:59:50	Espyo	hm?
2013-10-07 22:59:51	@J	I forget
2013-10-07 22:59:57	Espyo	I...'ll just check the latest video
2013-10-07 23:00:12	Espyo	ah, the latest one, the daylight one, uses textures
2013-10-07 23:00:18	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Permanent/PFE/Daylight%21.avi
2013-10-07 23:00:21	Espyo	(now in .avi)
2013-10-07 23:00:39	@J	what was it before?
2013-10-07 23:00:54	Espyo	solid green
2013-10-07 23:00:57	Espyo	...oh
2013-10-07 23:00:58	Espyo	pfft
2013-10-07 23:00:59	Espyo	.wmv
2013-10-07 23:01:04	@J	yeah, this is new
2013-10-07 23:01:07	Espyo	PikFan had trouble with .wmv
2013-10-07 23:01:20	Espyo	must've done that video when you were away
2013-10-07 23:01:24	Espyo	that's SO old, though
2013-10-07 23:01:29	Espyo	my current version is a LOT better
2013-10-07 23:01:46	Espyo	well, I'm writing the [[Day]] article, so no WIP video
2013-10-07 23:02:04	@J	yeah, you can't really see the timer bubbles in the day
2013-10-07 23:02:12	@J	and night kind of looks like it's just fading out
2013-10-07 23:02:29	Espyo	a bit
2013-10-07 23:02:35	Espyo	but remember that that's sped up
2013-10-07 23:02:36	@J	maybe leave the captains lighter because of their helmet lights
2013-10-07 23:02:38	@J	and more blue
2013-10-07 23:02:40	@J	yes, of course
2013-10-07 23:02:40	Espyo	and the bubbles really need work
2013-10-07 23:02:51	Espyo	lighting on the captain's lights will have to be a thing
2013-10-07 23:02:56	Espyo	I mean, it's meant to be dark, but
2013-10-07 23:02:57	@J	love how the sun just goes off the screen
2013-10-07 23:03:07	Espyo	the sun meter is a complete disaster
2013-10-07 23:03:16	@J	yeah, the lights just look silly in the dark
2013-10-07 23:03:19	Espyo	I think I have the wrong number of bubbles, they're too small, ...
2013-10-07 23:03:22	@J	because they...don't give off light
2013-10-07 23:03:28	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-07 23:03:35	Espyo	but maybe some faint light
2013-10-07 23:03:45	Espyo	not from the captains' lights, but actual... something light
2013-10-07 23:03:49	Espyo	ok, let me try again
2013-10-07 23:03:57	Espyo	in caves, everything's dark, but there's a bit of light around yuo
2013-10-07 23:03:59	@J	is AI one of the things you've worked on?
2013-10-07 23:03:59	Espyo	*you
2013-10-07 23:04:09	Espyo	I could do kinda the same on the surface, at night, but a bit weaker
2013-10-07 23:04:12	Espyo	not yet
2013-10-07 23:04:15	Espyo	err...
2013-10-07 23:04:19	Espyo	well, kinda
2013-10-07 23:04:23	@J	well, there is some light, because it's not completely black
2013-10-07 23:04:29	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-07 23:04:33	@J	I mean, making the Pikmin stop moving so much when they can't
2013-10-07 23:04:36	Espyo	a group of Pikmin can be moved with the C-stick
2013-10-07 23:04:38	@J	and making them not overlap each other
2013-10-07 23:04:44	Espyo	that, not yet
2013-10-07 23:04:45	@J	same for captains
2013-10-07 23:04:54	Espyo	wait, "stop moving so much when they can't"?
2013-10-07 23:04:58	@J	yeah
2013-10-07 23:05:10	Espyo	making Pikmin not overlap is /really/ gonna be tricky to do effectively
2013-10-07 23:05:13	@J	if you whistle one, it walks to you, then tries to walk inside you, but can't
2013-10-07 23:05:17	Espyo	I'm not going to account 100*100 collisions every frame
2013-10-07 23:05:24	@J	so it just jerks about a bit
2013-10-07 23:05:29	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-07 23:05:37	Espyo	in fact, I'm currently having some wonky troubles with moving
2013-10-07 23:05:41	@J	yeah, you need a better way of doing it than actually trying to do it properly
2013-10-07 23:05:47	Espyo	I think somewhere along the line, /something/ became an int instead of a float
2013-10-07 23:05:53	Espyo	and there's jerkiness where there shouldn't
2013-10-07 23:05:54	@J	that sounds so wrong
2013-10-07 23:06:00	Espyo	it does
2013-10-07 23:06:13	@J	what I mean is, there's probably a nice shortcut to get it feeling fine
2013-10-07 23:06:18	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-07 23:06:19	@J	some sort of approximation
2013-10-07 23:06:28	Espyo	also "pack mentality"...ish
2013-10-07 23:06:29	Espyo	thing
2013-10-07 23:06:36	@J	like, just move away from the nearest Pikmin a little each frame
2013-10-07 23:06:41	@J	if you're too near
2013-10-07 23:06:43	Espyo	I have to do something about the fact that, for instance, when they're dismissed, they're told to go to a certain spot
2013-10-07 23:06:43	@J	something like that
2013-10-07 23:06:48	Espyo	and they have to adjust themselves nicely
2013-10-07 23:06:58	Espyo	I suppose that'd have to be it
2013-10-07 23:07:14	@J	well, that's easy enough - just assign a grid of positions around the spot
2013-10-07 23:07:17	Espyo	though a huge percentage of my processor usage currently is coming from the drawing, not the logic
2013-10-07 23:07:21	Espyo	...so far
2013-10-07 23:07:28	Espyo	yeah, but how to fill them?
2013-10-07 23:07:31	Espyo	and effectively?
2013-10-07 23:07:35	@J	assign one per Pikmin?
2013-10-07 23:07:39	Espyo	*efficiently
2013-10-07 23:07:41	@J	or are you worrying about which goes where?
2013-10-07 23:07:46	Espyo	I can't have them aligned squarely
2013-10-07 23:07:50	@J	oh, right
2013-10-07 23:07:52	Espyo	more like that, yeah
2013-10-07 23:07:52	@J	hmm
2013-10-07 23:08:03	Espyo	that's where I get stalled
2013-10-07 23:08:22	@J	no, by 'which goes where', I meant more making each go to the nearest one, where possible
2013-10-07 23:08:32	Espyo	hm
2013-10-07 23:08:44	Espyo	but still, for every frame, 100*100 "nearest" calculations
2013-10-07 23:08:50	@J	okay, how about they all try to walk to the nearest 'open' space to the target
2013-10-07 23:08:54	Espyo	rather, 100*100 distance calculations
2013-10-07 23:09:08	Espyo	that sounds like it'd be it, kinda
2013-10-07 23:09:12	Espyo	every Pikmin tries to go to the center spot
2013-10-07 23:09:19	Espyo	if it's taken, go to the nearest empty
2013-10-07 23:09:30	Espyo	but that's just it, finding the nearest requires a distance check
2013-10-07 23:09:33	@J	first, I don't think 10k distance calculations per frame will really introduce much load
2013-10-07 23:09:33	Espyo	and those aren't really light
2013-10-07 23:09:43	@J	but you can probably optimise if you think about it a little
2013-10-07 23:09:55	Espyo	but it'll reach the zone where it's too much work
2013-10-07 23:10:02	Espyo	to optimize such a tiny little thingy
2013-10-07 23:10:27	@J	but it's so important
2013-10-07 23:10:35	@J	how they react, how everything feels
2013-10-07 23:10:51	Espyo	I know I know
2013-10-07 23:10:57	Espyo	but I mean the optimizations start not being important
2013-10-07 23:11:06	Espyo	start taking too much work just to save a couple of calculations
2013-10-07 23:11:12	Espyo	start to make me wonder the worth of it all
2013-10-07 23:11:19	@J	oh
2013-10-07 23:11:21	Espyo	and before I know it, I spent an entire year just making Pikmin move to a spot
2013-10-07 23:11:34	@J	when I say 'optimisations' I mean 'cheaty way of doing it'
2013-10-07 23:11:38	@J	hack, really
2013-10-07 23:12:18	@J	I would say start trying some really simple methods, ignoring performance
2013-10-07 23:12:23	Espyo	I know, but they also take time to think about smartly
2013-10-07 23:12:24	@J	see if any look vaguely good
2013-10-07 23:12:30	@J	then start thinking
2013-10-07 23:12:31	Espyo	right, it's the start of anything
2013-10-07 23:13:45	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Day there we go
2013-10-07 23:14:41	@J	hmm
2013-10-07 23:14:50	@J	maybe don't link to 7-day run for the Pikmin 3 bullet
2013-10-07 23:14:56	Espyo	I think one or two sentences are a bit off, but I can't put my finger on it
2013-10-07 23:15:08	Espyo	...oops
2013-10-07 23:15:09	@J	final smash should have caps?
2013-10-07 23:15:29	Espyo	ugh, yes, looking back, it looks ugly without 'em
2013-10-07 23:16:47	@J	the first bit reads almost like a list of things
2013-10-07 23:17:02	@J	not sure how to deal with it; can't be bothered/don't have the time right now
2013-10-07 23:17:05	Espyo	too many paragraph breaks
2013-10-07 23:17:11	Espyo	but everything's different
2013-10-07 23:17:17	Espyo	maybe except for the enemy info
2013-10-07 23:17:17	@J	yes, exactly
2013-10-07 23:17:21	Espyo	that belonged on its own section
2013-10-07 23:17:22	@J	because it's a list of things
2013-10-07 23:17:25	Espyo	I just did a quick move
2013-10-07 23:17:30	Espyo	well, I'll fix all those things

2013-10-07 23:22:46	@J	for reference, 10000 distance calculations per frame takes 1.7% of your compute time here
2013-10-07 23:22:56	@J	(in C, more like 25% in Python)
2013-10-07 23:23:10	@J	weirdly, sqrt is faster than pow in C, but it's the other way around in Python
2013-10-07 23:23:12	Espyo	that
2013-10-07 23:23:19	Espyo	is absolutely unacceptable
2013-10-07 23:23:26	Espyo	remember that I don't just check for distance from one Pikmin to another
2013-10-07 23:23:27	@J	I knew you were going to say that
2013-10-07 23:23:39	Espyo	I do it for /hundreds/ of existing hitboxes
2013-10-07 23:23:56	Espyo	I'll probably use a... what's it called
2013-10-07 23:24:13	Espyo	hang on
2013-10-07 23:24:43	@J	inb4commonsense
2013-10-07 23:25:25	Espyo	blockmap
2013-10-07 23:25:26	Espyo	that's the thing
2013-10-07 23:25:30	Espyo	a blockmap like Doom uses
2013-10-07 23:25:47	Espyo	to only check for hitboxes and such that are on the same grid square as the Pikmin
2013-10-07 23:25:52	Espyo	as to not check everywhere
2013-10-07 23:25:53	Espyo	but...
2013-10-07 23:25:56	@J	that's a spatial hash
2013-10-07 23:25:58	Espyo	even still it's heavy
2013-10-07 23:26:04	Espyo	I like Doom's name better
2013-10-07 23:26:29	@J	what's these hundreds of other hitboxes?
2013-10-07 23:26:48	@J	anyway, yeah, I've used a spatial hash before
2013-10-07 23:27:03	@J	written, I should say
2013-10-07 23:27:13	Espyo	well, for every enemy
2013-10-07 23:27:19	Espyo	for every treasure
2013-10-07 23:27:21	@J	I guess it kind of works, but I was just doing it just because, really

2013-10-07 23:27:40	@J	well, if you're doing physics over the whole level, then yeah, do a spatial hash
2013-10-07 23:27:44	Espyo	for every other Pikmin, every leader
2013-10-07 23:27:47	Espyo	oh, and let's not forget
2013-10-07 23:27:55	Espyo	checking for collisions on walls
2013-10-07 23:28:04	Espyo	has to be over the whole level
2013-10-07 23:28:08	@J	maybe you can do the sneaky thing they do in Pikmin
2013-10-07 23:28:12	Espyo	I guess I really have no choice but to use a spatial hash
2013-10-07 23:28:16	Espyo	...oh?
2013-10-07 23:28:17	@J	fuzzy things up where the camera isn't
2013-10-07 23:28:27	Espyo	oh, right
2013-10-07 23:28:34	Espyo	the "off-camera limbo", as I called it on the glitch articles
2013-10-07 23:28:39	Espyo	not really glitches, but yeah
2013-10-07 23:28:43	Espyo	yeah, I plan on doing something like that
2013-10-07 23:28:50	Espyo	no point in animating a Wollywog that's not even visible
2013-10-07 23:28:59	@J	but even for physics
2013-10-07 23:29:18	@J	ignore it outside of the camera, and just have Pikmin follow predefined routes, maybe
2013-10-07 23:29:56	Espyo	the routes are just waypoints
2013-10-07 23:30:03	Espyo	there really is no need to have anything more complex

2013-10-07 23:33:37	Espyo	where'd I place the audio bit for "Olimar!", "Louie!" and "Schecho!" on the pages?
2013-10-07 23:33:45	Espyo	right under the opening paragraph?
2013-10-07 23:33:56	Espyo	I plan on putting "Olimar!" on the Olimar article, and such
2013-10-07 23:33:59	@J	I didn't know you did that
2013-10-07 23:34:04	@J	oh
2013-10-07 23:34:09	@J	do you mean 'where do I'

2013-10-07 23:34:11	Espyo	heh

2013-10-07 23:34:30	@J	...infobox?
2013-10-07 23:34:30	Espyo	*actually
2013-10-07 23:34:38	Espyo	I'd have to force entry
2013-10-07 23:34:42	@J	what
2013-10-07 23:35:02	Espyo	by which I mean I'd have to edit [[Template:Infobox leader]]
2013-10-07 23:35:12	@J	yeah, of course
2013-10-07 23:36:01	Espyo	the sounds are kinda big
2013-10-07 23:36:05	Espyo	hm, the progress bar, I mean
2013-10-07 23:36:10	Espyo	when it expands, it's a real hippo
2013-10-07 23:36:15	@J	hippo
2013-10-07 23:36:48	@J	wouldn't be much wider than the image
2013-10-07 23:36:51	Espyo	hippos are big
2013-10-07 23:36:57	@J	yes, I know
2013-10-07 23:37:00	Espyo	well, I don't know the exact width, but
2013-10-07 23:37:06	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Whistle
2013-10-07 23:37:18	Espyo	I had to make each cell on the table that holds the sounds there be 360px
2013-10-07 23:37:28	Espyo	so... 320 something?
2013-10-07 23:37:29	Espyo	hm
2013-10-07 23:37:40	@J	won't the cell just expand to fit it?
2013-10-07 23:38:14	Espyo	no, actually
2013-10-07 23:38:39	Espyo	it should be possible to make the progress bar not be massive
2013-10-07 23:38:54	Espyo	I mean that both as "I wish it was possible" and "there must be a way"
2013-10-07 23:41:39	@J	okay, seems someone's decided to right-align the 'problems...' text
2013-10-07 23:41:59	@J	which means if the whole block could stretch to any size, it would float the far right of the page
2013-10-07 23:42:07	@J	so they've stuck a 200px width on the enclosing div
2013-10-07 23:42:14	@J	which is what's causing your issues
2013-10-07 23:43:36	Espyo	"problems..."?
2013-10-07 23:43:37	Espyo	what?
2013-10-07 23:43:38	@J	the right-align looks weird anyway
2013-10-07 23:43:47	@J	the italic bit below the player
2013-10-07 23:43:53	Espyo	ah
2013-10-07 23:43:59	Espyo	I see
2013-10-07 23:44:41	@J	.listenlist {width: auto !important;}
2013-10-07 23:44:41	@J	.listenlist p {text-align: left !important;}
2013-10-07 23:44:44	@J	that should do it
2013-10-07 23:46:41	Espyo	I don't see you changing that on Special:RecentChanges
2013-10-07 23:47:03	@J	...
2013-10-07 23:48:11	@J	well, I hope that doesn't mess anything else up
2013-10-07 23:48:14	@J	so, dismissing
2013-10-07 23:48:14	@J	you pick your point, then place Pikmin on a series of concentric circles
2013-10-07 23:48:14	@J	each time you expand, restrict the arc to bits that aren't beyond walls
2013-10-07 23:48:14	@J	then fuzzy up all the positions a bit, and assign positions based on distance, somehow
2013-10-07 23:48:14	@J	apply your real-time collision/AI logic and it might look good
2013-10-07 23:48:31	@J	*may have written that out while talking about other stuff*
2013-10-07 23:49:11	Espyo	don't really need to check wall collision on the concentric circles
2013-10-07 23:49:23	Espyo	(also I'm just speculating on what concentric circles are, the term is familiar but I'm not seeing it)
2013-10-07 23:49:35	Espyo	I just tell the Pikmin to go to that place, but if it can't reach there in 2 seconds, it should give up
2013-10-07 23:49:40	@J	circles centred at the same point with increasing sizes
2013-10-07 23:49:41	Espyo	the games kinda do the same
2013-10-07 23:49:52	Espyo	if you force to dismiss right next to a wall, they don't really go far
2013-10-07 23:49:57	Espyo	right, I figured that'd be it
2013-10-07 23:49:59	@J	but then if the point were near a wall, they would all crush up against the wall
2013-10-07 23:49:59	Espyo	ta
2013-10-07 23:50:10	@J	...like in the games
2013-10-07 23:50:12	@J	fair enough
2013-10-07 23:50:13	Espyo	ah, but that's where the collision logic would kick in
2013-10-07 23:50:21	Espyo	they'd separate themselves slowly enough
2013-10-07 23:50:25	@J	yeah
2013-10-07 23:50:26	Espyo	smoothly enough too, I'd believe
2013-10-07 23:50:28	@J	that always annoyed me
2013-10-07 23:50:45	Espyo	what, crunching up against a single point?
2013-10-07 23:50:52	@J	no
2013-10-07 23:51:05	@J	IIRC, they kind of all run to the wall, then spread out again
2013-10-07 23:51:12	@J	and end up spread out quite far along it
2013-10-07 23:51:44	@J	so, I guess, try if you can, but otherwise just put it on a 'this would be nice to have one day' list
2013-10-07 23:52:00	Espyo	oh yeah
2013-10-07 23:52:01	Espyo	they do
2013-10-07 23:52:06	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-07 23:52:14	Espyo	you know one of the things that's on that list?
2013-10-07 23:52:17	Espyo	blood stains
2013-10-07 23:52:20	Espyo	what if Pikmin had blood...
2013-10-07 23:52:21	@J	I'll see if I can think of a solution to the Pikmin-Pikmin 'collisions'
2013-10-07 23:52:22	@J	...
2013-10-07 23:52:23	Espyo	now we can find out!
2013-10-07 23:52:24	@J	they
2013-10-07 23:52:26	@J	well, they do
2013-10-07 23:52:28	Espyo	purely for trivial purposes
2013-10-07 23:52:32	@J	they just don't stain the ground
2013-10-07 23:52:39	@J	you can see it sometimes
2013-10-07 23:52:42	Espyo	well, Pikmin and enemies
2013-10-07 23:52:48	Espyo	I actually meant Pikmin as in the games
2013-10-07 23:52:50	@J	or...well, I guess it just looks like juice
2013-10-07 23:52:51	Espyo	you can?
2013-10-07 23:52:52	@J	yeah
2013-10-07 23:52:59	@J	I took a great screenshot of it once
2013-10-07 23:53:03	Espyo	that's vaguely familar, but
2013-10-07 23:53:24	Espyo	while you find that screenshot
2013-10-07 23:53:36	Espyo	I checked the Doom source code, and there is a thing that's approximate distances
2013-10-07 23:53:41	@J	this shot was of the Cloaking Burrow-nit near the bridge in WW spearing a Pikmin up close
2013-10-07 23:53:47	@J	and no, I won't be able to find it
2013-10-07 23:53:49	Espyo	they should be good enough to check if 2 Pikmin are close, because I don't need ultra-exact values
2013-10-07 23:54:04	Espyo	but I'm not too sure on how inexact it is
2013-10-07 23:54:10	Espyo	it's really hacky, I don't get it
2013-10-07 23:54:15	Espyo	it checks the bits in something
2013-10-07 23:54:19	Espyo	hang on, let me see if I can find it
2013-10-07 23:54:20	@J	I think it would be better to try to come up with a multi-body averaging-type solution
2013-10-07 23:54:31	Espyo	also I knew it was familiar, you saying Cloaking Burrow-nit really triggered something
2013-10-07 23:54:36	Espyo	but I still don't fully remember...
2013-10-07 23:54:42	@J	where the answer just seems to come out of it magically
2013-10-07 23:54:51	Espyo	via spreading logic?
2013-10-07 23:54:58	@J	sure, if that's a thing
2013-10-07 23:55:05	Espyo	the collision/spreading logic
2013-10-07 23:55:09	Espyo	guess it's mostly it
2013-10-07 23:55:16	Espyo	everyone goes to a point, and they just spread out in their own time
2013-10-07 23:55:25	Espyo	but
2013-10-07 23:55:26	@J	oh, I'm not talking about dismissing any more
2013-10-07 23:55:49	@J	I'm talking about spreading out if they do happen to get close, and not ending up in bunches in the first place
2013-10-07 23:55:51	Espyo	ugh, all Pikmin want to go to the reference point, so the ones that aren't there yet will keep insisting
2013-10-07 23:56:00	Espyo	hm
2013-10-07 23:56:45	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:CloakNit.jpg pfft what?
2013-10-07 23:56:47	Espyo	why do we have this?
2013-10-07 23:56:56	Espyo	it's really nice, but...
2013-10-08 00:04:01	@J	...
2013-10-08 00:04:11	@J	tried to find the Pikmin blood, failed
2013-10-08 00:04:13	@J	need to sleep
2013-10-08 00:04:21	Espyo	oh well
2013-10-08 00:04:23	@J	it's a user image
2013-10-08 00:04:25	@J	so
2013-10-08 00:04:29	@J	why not
2013-10-08 00:04:36	@J	unused, though
2013-10-08 00:04:37	Espyo	but it's not being used
2013-10-08 00:04:46	Espyo	anyway, I don't think the CSS broke anything
2013-10-08 00:04:50	Espyo	I tested on the template, everything looks fine
2013-10-08 00:04:53	Espyo	so you can go sleep easy
2013-10-08 00:05:01	Espyo	or hard, I don't know how your bed is
2013-10-08 00:05:05	@J	good, good
2013-10-08 00:05:14	@J	pfft, who needs beds
2013-10-08 00:05:14	Espyo	though I'm >this< close to pressing submit
2013-10-08 00:05:19	Espyo	might as well wait 2 more seconds
2013-10-08 00:05:21	Espyo	(or more)
2013-10-08 00:06:45	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Captain_Olimar looks like nothing's breaking
2013-10-08 00:06:56	Espyo	I'm kinda nervous about P1 vs P2 vs P3

2013-10-08 00:07:09	@J	meh, near enough
2013-10-08 00:07:13	@J	anyway, *gone*
2013-10-08 00:07:14	Espyo	luckily, there are no name calls in P1, there is no Olimar, Louie or President (that can be called) in P3
2013-10-08 00:07:15	Espyo	so...
2013-10-08 00:07:18	Espyo	until P4 comes around, we're safe

2013-10-08 00:08:54	Espyo	its eyes should be closed, if it was chomping, no?

2013-10-08 18:53:18	@J	so, weird dreams last night
2013-10-08 18:53:54	Espyo	did you dream you broke the CSS
2013-10-08 18:53:55	@J	lots of it because it was so normal
2013-10-08 18:54:19	@J	like, I was checking whether I would have enough fruit for the next few days
2013-10-08 18:54:24	@J	and I had some apples and plums
2013-10-08 18:54:36	@J	which is really weird to dream about, and I don't even have plums IRL
2013-10-08 18:54:43	@J	then there was the weird bit
2013-10-08 18:54:56	@J	I continued talking to you over IRC
2013-10-08 18:55:04	@J	except you were sitting next to me
2013-10-08 18:55:10	@J	and you were someone I know IRL
2013-10-08 18:55:27	@J	at some point (even though it was the middle of the day) I signed off to sleep
2013-10-08 18:55:30	Espyo	well the most convenient way to talk IRL IS via IRC
2013-10-08 18:55:47	@J	then I turned to look at non-you, and saw you didn't have a computer
2013-10-08 18:56:29	@J	the desk had a big unit on it, a wooden square with a large hole in the middle
2013-10-08 18:56:59	@J	through it, I could see the backs of some monitors, around 3 of them, with different sizes/aspect ratios, and not on the desk but suspended
2013-10-08 18:57:15	@J	beyond that was a mirror, so I realised you'd been using those monitors via the mirror
2013-10-08 18:57:21	@J	ignoring the lack of mouse and keyboard
2013-10-08 18:57:32	@J	then some guy through the hole started
2013-10-08 18:57:34	@J	...
2013-10-08 18:57:45	@J	then some guy through the hole started taking pictures of us
2013-10-08 18:58:00	@J	so you got out a camera (not a phone) and took pictures of him
2013-10-08 18:58:17	@J	and the guy got annoyed, because he was just testing his camera
2013-10-08 18:58:50	@J	need to eat, I'll tell you the restaurant bit later
2013-10-08 18:59:01	Espyo	pfft

2013-10-08 19:52:32	@J	so the restaurant wasn't a restaurant, it was a Chinese takeaway
2013-10-08 19:52:53	Espyo	fancy
2013-10-08 19:52:54	@J	they only had starters, though, so I teleported inside to the restaurant bit or something
2013-10-08 19:53:14	@J	the tables had huge pits in the middle with food in
2013-10-08 19:53:52	@J	and there was a Japanese woman and a French man, who could each only speak their languages, but came together and were related
2013-10-08 19:54:03	@J	and also, I could understand them, somehow
2013-10-08 19:54:57	@J	then I looked at the time and it was half past midnight, so I woke up to find it was 9am
2013-10-08 19:55:06	@J	which is pretty late
2013-10-08 19:55:21	@J	I think I dreamed some times which messed up the real time
2013-10-08 19:55:28	@J	so I unset my alarm
2013-10-08 20:02:42	Espyo	heh
2013-10-08 20:46:13	Espyo	...help
2013-10-08 20:46:24	Espyo	I'm on the Sanctuary Fortress for the first time in this playthrough
2013-10-08 20:46:54	Espyo	the Quad MB and Quad CM battle me, and I need to destroy them to open the way on this room, as it's blocked by a red magic wall of magic
2013-10-08 20:47:09	Espyo	I killed the main body via boost ball really close to the red magic wall
2013-10-08 20:47:14	Espyo	and now the head spawned on the other side
2013-10-08 20:47:19	Espyo	it can shoot me but I can't shoot it
2013-10-08 20:49:11	Espyo	oh phew

2013-10-09 19:07:34	@J	(I set my status to 'offline')
2013-10-09 19:08:06	Espyo	right
2013-10-09 19:08:23	@J	which game is the turret thing?
2013-10-09 19:08:24	Espyo	also, today I dreamed about me explaining to you why my grandma is a horrible person
2013-10-09 19:08:28	Espyo	Metroid Prime 2
2013-10-09 19:10:58	@J	I don't remember having a turret in that
2013-10-09 19:11:26	@J	I had a load more weird dreams last night, but I don't really remember them
2013-10-09 19:11:51	@J	I know I had super powers in one, and I was at a canteen ordering food in another
2013-10-09 19:12:04	@J	not sure why I'm having so many dreams lately
2013-10-09 19:14:27	Espyo	yeah, it's weird
2013-10-09 19:14:29	Espyo	they just come and go
2013-10-09 19:14:37	Espyo	also there's a turret when you first find the pirates
2013-10-09 19:14:39	Espyo	 2, in fact
2013-10-09 19:14:44	Espyo	the pirates man them, and you need to take them down
2013-10-09 19:18:16	@J	oh, yeah
2013-10-09 19:18:22	@J	in the place
2013-10-09 19:18:24	@J	I remember
2013-10-09 19:19:55	@J	so, fun thing today at work: running some tests that fail inconsistently
2013-10-09 19:20:04	@J	if you run them separately, they all pass
2013-10-09 19:20:17	@J	if you run them all together, they rarely all pass, but it usually fails in the same place
2013-10-09 19:20:33	@J	except that place changes whenever you do anything, such as leave it for a minute, or add some debuggign
2013-10-09 19:20:36	@J	*ng
2013-10-09 19:22:00	Espyo	hm, weird
2013-10-09 19:22:05	Espyo	what was the answer?

2013-10-09 19:42:14	@J	more like I gave up
2013-10-09 19:42:20	@J	and moved onto another thing
2013-10-09 19:42:55	@J	it's a messaging thing, so it's probably some weird timing issue
2013-10-09 19:43:04	Espyo	ah, right
2013-10-09 19:43:25	@J	like, maybe the server rejects very rapid sending without telling the sender

2013-10-09 21:33:02	@J	for checking for Pikmin near each other, you could try sorting on the x co-ordinate, then checking y co-ordinates for nearby Pikmin
2013-10-09 21:33:13	@J	should be faster, but not quite a full-blown spatial hash
2013-10-09 21:33:20	Espyo	hm, I guess
2013-10-09 21:33:27	Espyo	or instead of distance check, use square hitboxes
2013-10-09 21:33:35	Espyo	I was thinking whether to switch to square hitboxes, today
2013-10-09 21:33:38	Espyo	(or rectangular)
2013-10-09 21:33:54	@J	that's similar, but slower as you still have to check every combination
2013-10-09 21:34:00	@J	sorting magics that into something faster
2013-10-09 21:34:13	Espyo	right
2013-10-09 21:34:34	@J	then I guess you just want to sum the vectors to move away from too-near Pikmin, dividing by distance or something,
2013-10-09 21:34:49	@J	and that becomes an alteration to their movement
2013-10-09 21:35:05	@J	and you just make sure to cap total speed when adding it to pre-existing movement

2013-10-09 21:37:04	@J	okay, that's starting to get annoying
2013-10-09 21:37:11	Espyo	heh
2013-10-09 21:38:41	@J	so, I made enough dinner for 2 meals, then was hungry enough to eat it all, and now I'm still hungry
2013-10-09 21:39:00	@J	it's not like I did any exercise today or anything
2013-10-09 21:39:07	@J	and I had a cooked meal and cake at lunchtime too
2013-10-09 21:40:26	Espyo	wonder if you actually did work out
2013-10-09 21:40:37	Espyo	you'd probably eat a 4-family meal for a snack
2013-10-09 21:42:39	@J	and spend all my money on food

2013-10-10 17:28:27	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-10-10 17:39:10	Espyo	yes!
2013-10-10 17:39:18	Espyo	I can make a Dark Splinter do ISG at will!
2013-10-10 17:39:24	Espyo	Miles, you HAVE to try this
2013-10-10 17:39:26	Espyo	and you have to record it
2013-10-10 17:39:32	Espyo	it's too hilarious not to be recorded
2013-10-10 17:39:45	Espyo	I would do it, but Nintendo decided it'd be a good idea to force PAL60
2013-10-10 18:07:01	Miles	?
2013-10-10 18:07:28	Espyo	ah, there you are!
2013-10-10 18:07:39	Espyo	ok, ready to record a Metroid Prime 2 glitch on video?
2013-10-10 18:09:19	Miles	Uh, no
2013-10-10 18:09:24	Miles	But tell me what it is anyway
2013-10-10 18:09:25	Miles	>_>
2013-10-10 18:09:45	Espyo	but you must!
2013-10-10 18:09:48	Espyo	I know you will eventually
2013-10-10 18:09:59	Espyo	so basically, IGS is Samus accumulating speed because she's trapped
2013-10-10 18:10:14	Espyo	and then unleashing it with a huge blast, that makes her go really fast, right?
2013-10-10 18:10:53	Espyo	well, I can make the Dark Splinters near the start of the game, on the Temple Assembly Site do an IGS
2013-10-10 18:11:16	Espyo	it involves going to the Storage Cavern where you get the first Energy Tank
2013-10-10 18:11:31	Espyo	then scaring the Dark Splinters away until one of them tries to run away against a wall
2013-10-10 18:11:48	Espyo	and it just stands there forever ‚Äî I currently have one running against the wall as I type this
2013-10-10 18:12:00	Espyo	the thing is, when you get close to it, it decides it should jump on you, I guess
2013-10-10 18:12:06	Espyo	and... all that running against the wall builds up speed
2013-10-10 18:12:14	Espyo	when he jumps at you... he REALLY jumps
2013-10-10 18:12:24	Espyo	if you leave him running for 10 seconds, he'll jump around twice as high as he should
2013-10-10 18:12:41	Espyo	leave him a full minute, he'll jump almost as high as the highest point of the room
2013-10-10 18:12:47	Espyo	I left mine for like 10 minutes now
2013-10-10 18:12:51	Espyo	I'm scared to see what'll happen
2013-10-10 18:12:57	Espyo	I'm guessing he'll vanish in a single frame
2013-10-10 18:13:11	Espyo	best case scenario: the game breaks so hard, it glitches me into a 100% completion
2013-10-10 18:13:20	Espyo	...that's not gonna happen, but I can always dream
2013-10-10 18:13:42	Espyo	I guess I'm gonna let the little guy go now
2013-10-10 18:14:44	Espyo	...drat, I blew it
2013-10-10 18:14:55	Espyo	I was trying to make another one jump as well, I made the guy that was stuck snap out of it
2013-10-10 18:15:19	Espyo	what?! there's one stuck inside a container?!
2013-10-10 18:17:15	Espyo	well, if you're going to record it, let me know, so I can give you the exact steps
2013-10-10 18:17:31	Espyo	I can reproduce it every time with a small setup thing I've come up with
2013-10-10 18:47:39	@J	...Infinite Sword Glitch?
2013-10-10 18:48:10	@J	[17:39:45] Espyo I would do it, but Nintendo decided it'd be a good idea to force PAL60
2013-10-10 18:48:14	@J	oh yeah, that thing
2013-10-10 18:48:23	Espyo	heh
2013-10-10 18:48:25	Espyo	close
2013-10-10 18:48:29	Espyo	Infinite Speed Glitch
2013-10-10 18:48:34	@J	right
2013-10-10 18:48:48	@J	I mean, ISG is actually a LoZ thing too, I think
2013-10-10 18:50:26	Espyo	Speed? not in LoZ
2013-10-10 18:50:31	Espyo	Infinite SWORD Glitch is
2013-10-10 18:50:40	Espyo	Ocarina of Time, and Majora's Mask
2013-10-10 18:50:49	@J	yeah, sword

2013-10-10 19:11:09	Espyo	ok, that scary thing with floats suddenly being integers
2013-10-10 19:11:13	Espyo	I've got it figured out
2013-10-10 19:11:32	Espyo	a mob that's chasing a point stops chasing it if its next step would pass the X and Y coordinates
2013-10-10 19:11:43	Espyo	when I saw a mob spazzing, I was just moving right
2013-10-10 19:12:00	Espyo	and they only stop when the X and Y are passed
2013-10-10 19:12:18	Espyo	ok, that wasn't it
2013-10-10 19:32:01	@J	good, because I didn't understand it
2013-10-10 19:32:14	Espyo	this is all very confusing
2013-10-10 19:32:16	Espyo	when it shouldn't be
2013-10-10 19:32:27	Espyo	how would you make an algorithm for a mob that moves until it reaches a spot?
2013-10-10 19:33:01	Espyo	for every tick, find out where the angle of the target point is, and make the mob move in that direction, for the speed it normally moves at
2013-10-10 19:33:13	Espyo	when it reaches the point, set a flag that makes it not move
2013-10-10 19:33:14	Espyo	simple, right?
2013-10-10 19:33:19	Espyo	well, it turns out it's not
2013-10-10 19:33:21	@J	no need for angles
2013-10-10 19:33:25	Espyo	I keep having trouble everywhere
2013-10-10 19:33:30	Espyo	what do you mean?
2013-10-10 19:33:44	@J	dx = target_x - x; dy = target_y - y
2013-10-10 19:34:05	@J	dist = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)
2013-10-10 19:34:15	Espyo	mhm...
2013-10-10 19:34:16	@J	dx *= speed / dist
2013-10-10 19:34:18	@J	dx *= speed / dist
2013-10-10 19:34:21	@J	dy *= speed / dist
2013-10-10 19:34:23	@J	...
2013-10-10 19:34:25	@J	near enough
2013-10-10 19:34:40	@J	but yeah
2013-10-10 19:34:45	Espyo	...what
2013-10-10 19:34:54	Espyo	that'll just make it walk slower each time
2013-10-10 19:34:55	@J	the question was the when it gets there part failing?
2013-10-10 19:35:01	@J	no
2013-10-10 19:35:06	@J	that will move at a constant speed
2013-10-10 19:35:15	@J	I'm normalising the speed
2013-10-10 19:35:16	Espyo	oh yeah, the division's always 1
2013-10-10 19:35:22	Espyo	right, right, right
2013-10-10 19:35:34	@J	you do speed = min(speed, dist) first
2013-10-10 19:35:50	@J	I mean, depends how momentum-y you want it
2013-10-10 19:36:06	@J	that's a super-basic way of doing it that will probably look too smooth
2013-10-10 19:36:19	Espyo	let me give it a shot
2013-10-10 19:36:22	Espyo	the code is a bit messy atm
2013-10-10 19:36:28	@J	is it trying to attack that point, or stop there?
2013-10-10 19:36:29	Espyo	so maybe that somehow fixes things
2013-10-10 19:36:34	Espyo	stop there
2013-10-10 19:36:34	@J	if the latter, you want to slow down earlier
2013-10-10 19:37:12	@J	try storing a speed and altering acceleration
2013-10-10 19:37:29	@J	and then stop accelerating when it's near
2013-10-10 19:37:44	@J	and just tweak the numbers
2013-10-10 19:38:38	Espyo	acceleration is in here somewhere, it's just not doing a thing
2013-10-10 19:39:55	@J	mm
2013-10-10 19:40:38	@J	maybe just 'speed *= min(dist, k) / k' for some k
2013-10-10 19:41:03	@J	that's for no acceleration
2013-10-10 19:41:19	Espyo	yeah, but I don't need smoothness
2013-10-10 19:41:22	Espyo	not for now, at least

2013-10-10 20:34:14	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-10-10 20:46:11	Espyo	oh, funny thing
2013-10-10 20:46:20	Espyo	if your game is paused by the debugger
2013-10-10 20:46:26	Espyo	if you attempt to show the desktop on windows
2013-10-10 20:46:27	Espyo	it won't
2013-10-10 20:46:41	Espyo	that'll be queued until the game's window is unpaused by the debugger
2013-10-10 20:47:29	Espyo	ok, this is working pretty much perfectly, but
2013-10-10 20:47:31	Espyo	I don't know why
2013-10-10 20:49:23	Espyo	bla bla, everything like you said, pretty much, bla bla
2013-10-10 20:49:39	Espyo	when I need to apply the min, it's between the normal speed, and the distance
2013-10-10 20:49:52	Espyo	but I need a small calculation, because my speed is measured in units per second
2013-10-10 20:49:55	Espyo	not units per frame
2013-10-10 20:50:00	Espyo	simple enough
2013-10-10 20:50:15	Espyo	the normal speed is the normal speed and the distance is distance * game_fps
2013-10-10 20:50:21	Espyo	which basically makes them at the same level
2013-10-10 20:50:26	Espyo	now here's the weird part
2013-10-10 20:50:34	Espyo	it only works right if I divide the fps by 2
2013-10-10 20:50:44	Espyo	or else it goes back and forth by the same amount each time
2013-10-10 21:02:07	Espyo	well, that teaches me not to mess with the laws of the universe
2013-10-10 21:04:31	Espyo	I was just trying to make things tidy by making a dx and dy smaller than 0.001 be 0
2013-10-10 21:04:38	Espyo	because the mobs never truly stop because floats
2013-10-10 21:04:53	Espyo	aaaaaand somehow that magically makes the mob teleport to the underworld
2013-10-10 21:08:17	Espyo	last I checked, 0 divided by 2 doesn't equal madness, does it?
2013-10-10 21:08:46	Espyo	GAAH
2013-10-10 21:08:53	Espyo	< 0.001
2013-10-10 21:08:57	Espyo	-300 is less than 0.001
2013-10-10 21:10:26	Espyo	...oh

2013-10-10 21:20:07	@J	just reading a load of stuff Espyo said before you got here
2013-10-10 21:20:08	Espyo	also hi
2013-10-10 21:20:11	PikFan	and P3, when time calls for it
2013-10-10 21:20:15	Espyo	right
2013-10-10 21:20:16	PikFan	oh
2013-10-10 21:20:19	PikFan	heh
2013-10-10 21:20:38	@J	[20:50:15] Espyo the normal speed is the normal spee
2013-10-10 21:20:40	@J	I see
2013-10-10 21:21:24	PikFan	did anyone see this? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Quaggled_Mireclops
2013-10-10 21:21:35	PikFan	somebody needs to improve it
2013-10-10 21:21:39	@J	yeah
2013-10-10 21:21:47	PikFan	I would, but I have no time
2013-10-10 21:21:48	@J	well, no
2013-10-10 21:21:54	Espyo	I would, but I have no knowledge
2013-10-10 21:21:56	@J	I saw it added, but didn't look at it
2013-10-10 21:22:00	@J	also what Espyo said
2013-10-10 21:22:14	PikFan	hm, yeah
2013-10-10 21:22:20	PikFan	so me then
2013-10-10 21:22:27	Espyo	not necessarily
2013-10-10 21:22:32	Espyo	it's not worse than the rest of the Pikmin 3 stuff
2013-10-10 21:22:37	Espyo	because that's just plain non-existent
2013-10-10 21:22:40	Espyo	so why are you worrying so much?
2013-10-10 21:22:46	Espyo	there's nothing that can be done at the moment
2013-10-10 21:23:06	PikFan	I'm not quite sure what you mean by nothing
2013-10-10 21:23:18	Espyo	well... nothing
2013-10-10 21:23:21	Espyo	nothing Pikmin 3 related
2013-10-10 21:23:39	@J	[21:04:31] Espyo I was just trying to make things tidy by making a dx and dy smaller than 0.001 be 0[21:04:38] Espyo because the mobs never truly stop because floats
2013-10-10 21:23:54	@J	well, why is he still trying to go there when he's already arrived?
2013-10-10 21:24:01	Espyo	he hasn't
2013-10-10 21:24:07	@J	(not sure why no line break)
2013-10-10 21:24:17	Espyo	remember that he moves, say, 2.01273518 units on the next frame
2013-10-10 21:24:20	PikFan	wait what
2013-10-10 21:24:29	Espyo	and the distance is 2.01273519 units
2013-10-10 21:24:30	@J	I mean, if it gets within 1 or something, you should make it stop trying to get there
2013-10-10 21:24:37	PikFan	<J>: well, why is he still trying to go there when he's already arrived?
2013-10-10 21:24:40	Espyo	it moves one beyond, goes back,but because floats are floats, it moves 2
2013-10-10 21:24:43	Espyo	and so on and so on
2013-10-10 21:24:50	Espyo	(1 pico-unit or whatever)
2013-10-10 21:24:51	PikFan	oh, wait
2013-10-10 21:25:06	PikFan	never mind, I just realised what you meant
2013-10-10 21:25:10	Espyo	but I am making it stop trying to get there
2013-10-10 21:25:13	Espyo	that's... the whole idea
2013-10-10 21:25:25	@J	it shouldn't be an issue
2013-10-10 21:25:48	Espyo	oh, important-ish thing, PikFan
2013-10-10 21:25:52	Espyo	you have NPC!, right?
2013-10-10 21:26:05	@J	instead of the min, just do: if speed > dist then move to target and stop
2013-10-10 21:26:14	PikFan	yes, NPC! P2
2013-10-10 21:26:17	Espyo	that requires more steps than not
2013-10-10 21:26:48	Espyo	I'll record the engine's "D-Pad-down-group-move" mechanic, and I want you to tell me if it resembles NPC!'s
2013-10-10 21:27:03	Espyo	I have vague memories of how the mechanic looks like in NPC!, but I could never check again
2013-10-10 21:27:09	Espyo	might as well check with someone who knows
2013-10-10 21:27:12	Espyo	but now I have dinner
2013-10-10 21:28:17	PikFan	okay, gtg now
2013-10-10 21:28:18	PikFan	bye

2013-10-10 22:24:21	@J	it's just that most people aren't necessarily always watching if they're here, so you might not get replies straight away

2013-10-10 22:27:19	Marioguy123	*sigh*
2013-10-10 22:27:34	Marioguy123	NOT ASKING BTW
2013-10-10 22:27:34	@J	hmm, do you think it would be better?
2013-10-10 22:27:42	@J	would it be much different, if you were op?
2013-10-10 22:27:42	Marioguy123	yes

2013-10-10 22:27:55	@J	quick 10 minutes
2013-10-10 22:28:18	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-10 22:28:50	Espyo	ok, mapping Pikmin controls to a + style 4-button gamepad is harder than it looks
2013-10-10 22:28:51	@J	more importantly, after all this time, has anyone yet solved the question of why people think being ops and stuff would be fun?
2013-10-10 22:28:53	Espyo	I mean, it's hard to know what's what
2013-10-10 22:29:00	Espyo	they're young and naive
2013-10-10 22:29:13	Espyo	you can pretty much use that to answer anything about them
2013-10-10 22:29:25	@J	any particular gamepad?
2013-10-10 22:29:53	Espyo	Maverick VS, from NGS
2013-10-10 22:29:58	Espyo	this is a brick, more like
2013-10-10 22:30:03	@J	never heard of it
2013-10-10 22:30:23	@J	National Geographic Society?
2013-10-10 22:30:44	Espyo	that's their old name
2013-10-10 22:30:51	@J	never mind, found it
2013-10-10 22:30:54	Espyo	Neo... Geo... System
2013-10-10 22:31:01	@J	http://www.amazon.com/NGS-Maverick-Game-button-PlayStation/dp/B000GFKYFU
2013-10-10 22:31:03	@J	this guy?
2013-10-10 22:31:07	@J	missing the VS, though
2013-10-10 22:31:09	@J	if that matters
2013-10-10 22:31:10	@J	*thing
2013-10-10 22:31:38	@J	so a PlayStation controller
2013-10-10 22:31:43	Espyo	it does
2013-10-10 22:31:46	Espyo	that looks more comfy
2013-10-10 22:31:54	@J	how many shoulder/back buttons?
2013-10-10 22:32:03	Espyo	but... yeah, your plain old 4 button + style controller, that looks like a PlayStation one
2013-10-10 22:32:04	Espyo	 4
2013-10-10 22:32:15	@J	wait...isn't that basically the same as a GameCube one
2013-10-10 22:32:24	Espyo	the game cube has a
2013-10-10 22:32:25	Espyo	err
2013-10-10 22:32:29	@J	you can work it the same
2013-10-10 22:32:33	@J	just X and Y change
2013-10-10 22:32:40	Espyo	it's still confusing, believe me
2013-10-10 22:32:41	@J	to other shoulder buttons, I guess
2013-10-10 22:32:48	Espyo	I keep dismissing when I want to switch leaders
2013-10-10 22:32:56	@J	yeah, switched D-pad/A-sticks would be strange, I guess
2013-10-10 22:33:10	Espyo	not so much the D-pad and such, I can get used to that
2013-10-10 22:33:17	Espyo	but the button layout is really weird
2013-10-10 22:33:23	Espyo	I can use both types just fine
2013-10-10 22:33:29	Espyo	but when I'm using a game from one type on another...
2013-10-10 22:33:51	@J	circle = B, X = A, square = dismiss, triangle = switch leader
2013-10-10 22:33:53	@J	uh
2013-10-10 22:33:54	@J	...
2013-10-10 22:34:00	@J	square = X, triangle = Y
2013-10-10 22:34:23	Espyo	hm
2013-10-10 22:34:30	Espyo	but it's uncomfortable having B and A on circle and square
2013-10-10 22:34:36	@J	I switched sides for dismiss/whistle because it feels right in my mind
2013-10-10 22:34:50	@J	but maybe it's not and you just end up with the exact same layout
2013-10-10 22:34:59	@J	in which case you don't need any help
2013-10-10 22:35:25	@J	I was thinking SNES when you said it
2013-10-10 22:35:30	@J	that would be tricky
2013-10-10 22:45:44	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Yellow_Wollywog&curid=1748&diff=74558&oldid=74113&rcid=27931
2013-10-10 22:45:48	Espyo	so, do we want that category?
2013-10-10 22:48:24	@J	kind of weird
2013-10-10 22:48:49	@J	it's not like we have fire enemies or water enemies
2013-10-10 22:48:54	@J	or...eating enemies
2013-10-10 22:49:05	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-10 22:49:09	Espyo	though we should... maybe
2013-10-10 22:49:12	@J	hmm
2013-10-10 22:49:15	Espyo	actually, not "maybe"
2013-10-10 22:49:17	@J	maybe elemental enemies
2013-10-10 22:49:18	Espyo	that's a good thing to have
2013-10-10 22:49:24	@J	fire/water seem too few
2013-10-10 22:49:29	Espyo	at the very least, eating and stomping
2013-10-10 22:49:36	Espyo	or crushing
2013-10-10 22:50:02	@J	I think the only other thing is blowing air?  Is that elemental?
2013-10-10 22:50:13	@J	oh, boulders = crushing
2013-10-10 22:50:25	Espyo	blowing belongs on the non-lethal category
2013-10-10 22:50:33	Espyo	we called that harmless enemies, I think
2013-10-10 22:50:34	@J	true
2013-10-10 22:50:35	@J	yeah
2013-10-10 22:50:40	Espyo	what's the Cloaking Burrow-nit?
2013-10-10 22:50:45	Espyo	Stabby-stab enemies?
2013-10-10 22:51:00	Espyo	oh, no, he eats them in the end
2013-10-10 22:51:08	Espyo	the Jellyfloats eat as well...
2013-10-10 22:51:12	Espyo	ah, the blowhogs and dweevils
2013-10-10 22:51:13	@J	we have airborne enemies
2013-10-10 22:51:22	Espyo	those'll have to be elemental enemies, I guess
2013-10-10 22:51:30	@J	yeah, I said elemental
2013-10-10 22:51:35	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-10 22:51:39	Espyo	...what about the Smoky Progg
2013-10-10 22:51:47	@J	I guess it's elemental?
2013-10-10 22:51:58	@J	Goolix
2013-10-10 22:52:16	Espyo	that's just water
2013-10-10 22:52:22	@J	Pearly Clamclamp counts as eating?
2013-10-10 22:52:26	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-10 22:52:28	Espyo	you even see it chomp
2013-10-10 22:52:39	Espyo	...
2013-10-10 22:52:42	Espyo	Gattling Groink
2013-10-10 22:52:48	@J	ooh
2013-10-10 22:53:02	Espyo	I think we're getting ourselves into a LOT of trouble with these new categories
2013-10-10 22:53:03	@J	armed enemies
2013-10-10 22:53:12	Espyo	then again, it's not like they're a really chaotic thing
2013-10-10 22:53:16	Espyo	yeah, guess armed enemies'd work
2013-10-10 22:53:22	Espyo	oh, the Man-at-Legs'd fit there too
2013-10-10 22:53:24	@J	yeah, you don't even have to have one for every enemy
2013-10-10 22:53:32	Espyo	they're the two that actually use... weapons
2013-10-10 22:53:42	Espyo	that's right, we don't
2013-10-10 22:53:46	@J	Breadbug
2013-10-10 22:53:50	Espyo	well, shall we take care of that (eventually)
2013-10-10 22:53:52	Espyo	*?
2013-10-10 22:53:57	@J	yeah, sur
2013-10-10 22:53:57	@J	e
2013-10-10 22:54:03	Espyo	Breadbug is... maybe eating, at a stretch
2013-10-10 22:54:13	@J	there are probably lots of categories for lots of things we could think of that would be nice
2013-10-10 22:54:15	Espyo	ok, so we have eating, elemental, armed, crushing
2013-10-10 22:54:19	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-10 22:54:32	Espyo	they sure'd be helpful for the engine, I can tell you that much
2013-10-10 22:54:35	@J	it's death indirectly caused by hoarding
2013-10-10 22:54:51	Espyo	does the wiki even support such a long category name
2013-10-10 22:55:11	@J	enemies which indirectly cause Pikmin death by hoarding
2013-10-10 22:55:13	Espyo	I wonder if Candypop Buds cause death
2013-10-10 22:55:17	Espyo	and birth
2013-10-10 22:55:34	@J	only if the seed falls out of the world or something
2013-10-10 22:55:45	Espyo	involuntary death
2013-10-10 22:55:48	Espyo	...can it even?
2013-10-10 22:56:02	Espyo	don't see why not, but
2013-10-10 22:56:14	Espyo	is the seed a Pikmin object, or a seed object?
2013-10-10 22:56:21	Espyo	seeds aren't programmed to "die" from touching the border, I'd bet
2013-10-10 22:57:17	@J	yeah, that's silly
2013-10-10 22:57:26	@J	still not sure if we even want an armed one, for 2 enemies
2013-10-10 22:57:33	@J	unless there are many more in Pikmin 3
2013-10-10 22:57:36	Espyo	hm
2013-10-10 22:57:39	Espyo	right, right
2013-10-10 22:57:58	@J	explosion = elemental?
2013-10-10 22:58:04	@J	maybe not
2013-10-10 22:58:22	Espyo	I wouldn't say that
2013-10-10 22:58:30	Espyo	though I guess in the engine I'll make it as such
2013-10-10 22:58:39	Espyo	should the fangame maker want to create explosion-immune Pikmin
2013-10-10 23:05:41	@J	oh, I hadn't actually considered the mechanics of making that thing customisable
2013-10-10 23:05:49	@J	I guess you're not really doing that, yet, but
2013-10-10 23:05:54	@J	hmm
2013-10-10 23:06:14	@J	it'll probably be hard
2013-10-10 23:06:44	Espyo	what, immunity to explosions?
2013-10-10 23:06:54	@J	no, everything
2013-10-10 23:07:01	@J	'that thing' = the engine
2013-10-10 23:07:03	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-10 23:09:04	@J	anyway, I should go
2013-10-10 23:09:05	@J	bye
2013-10-10 23:10:24	Espyo	bye

2013-10-11 19:39:41	@J	Testyo memo PikFan I leave my computer(-ish thing) connected to IRC permanently now, and set my away status to 'offline' when I'm not here
2013-10-11 19:39:41	Testyo	Oh, J, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 11/10/2013 15:49 (GMT), saying: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Area_name_font.png took me a while, but I finally did it.
2013-10-11 19:39:42	Testyo	Done. I saved a memo for PikFan saying: I leave my computer(-ish thing) connected to IRC permanently now, and set my away status to 'offline' when I'm not here.
2013-10-11 19:40:26	@J	hey, if you're showing it off you could at least choose a sensible background colour
2013-10-11 19:40:38	@J	wait, did you make that $?
2013-10-11 19:40:59	@J	hmm, not bad
2013-10-11 19:41:04	@J	some are a bit weird, of course
2013-10-11 19:41:05	@J	like {
2013-10-11 19:41:27	@J	and you clearly need ¬¨
2013-10-11 19:41:44	@J	and ¬£
2013-10-11 19:41:50	@J	why 2 spaces?
2013-10-11 19:48:43	Espyo	it's just natural ASCII
2013-10-11 19:48:46	Espyo	and {} are by far the worst
2013-10-11 19:48:56	Espyo	I could not care less
2013-10-11 19:48:59	Espyo	I've been at it for a while
2013-10-11 19:49:10	Espyo	and ah, it DID memo you when you talked
2013-10-11 19:49:50	Espyo	¬£ and negation thingy aren't ASCII, and if I add those, I also have to add ‚Ç¨, and if I add that, I also have to add ` and ¬®, and if I add those, I also have to add √â, √Ñ, √õ, etc
2013-10-11 19:49:55	Espyo	so it's good enough
2013-10-11 19:50:05	Espyo	I didn't have a background color
2013-10-11 19:50:16	Espyo	I figured I'd just send the actual, transparent thing
2013-10-11 19:50:28	Espyo	at the very least, if I mess up, I have a backup on Dropbox' public folder
2013-10-11 19:50:36	Espyo	...though I also have a backup on the project's folder on Dropbox
2013-10-11 19:50:39	Espyo	and on GIT
2013-10-11 19:52:15	@J	your ' already looks like `
2013-10-11 19:52:37	Espyo	blame the original font
2013-10-11 19:52:40	Espyo	I think?
2013-10-11 19:52:41	Espyo	hang on
2013-10-11 19:52:50	@J	it looks like you have a background colour there - everything's green
2013-10-11 19:52:59	@J	oh wait
2013-10-11 19:53:01	Espyo	oh, heh
2013-10-11 19:53:03	@J	okay, did you just change it
2013-10-11 19:53:05	@J	?
2013-10-11 19:53:10	Espyo	yeah, the ` is just a backwards '

2013-10-11 19:53:55	Espyo	the ` is just backwards '
2013-10-11 19:53:58	Espyo	and ' already comes from the font
2013-10-11 19:54:06	Espyo	green is the separator color
2013-10-11 19:55:20	@J	pretty sure you just changed it
2013-10-11 19:55:31	@J	anyway, speaking of Git, when are you making the code public?
2013-10-11 19:55:42	Espyo	have to choose a website first
2013-10-11 19:58:30	Espyo	any tips on how to avoid getting run over by the Boost Guardian while he's boosting?
2013-10-11 20:00:05	Espyo	I'd watch the current low%, but that doesn't even fight it
2013-10-11 20:00:17	Espyo	oh, the 100% does, I bet
2013-10-11 20:04:38	@J	jump?
2013-10-11 20:04:54	@J	can't you stand on the pillars or something?
2013-10-11 20:06:01	Espyo	...don't think you can
2013-10-11 20:06:24	@J	more importantly: is it strange that when I have pizza, I only have 2 or 3 slices
2013-10-11 20:06:26	@J	uh, I mean
2013-10-11 20:06:33	@J	I only cut the whole thing into 2 or 3
2013-10-11 20:06:45	Espyo	it is
2013-10-11 20:08:43	Espyo	oh, you can
2013-10-11 20:09:09	Espyo	so I'll just scroll through the run to see where he fights the boss...
2013-10-11 20:09:21	Espyo	why is he at Quadraxis halfway through?!
2013-10-11 20:10:59	@J	you can stand on the pillars?
2013-10-11 20:11:41	Espyo	yep
2013-10-11 20:12:05	Espyo	...oh
2013-10-11 20:12:08	Espyo	that's just /lovely/

2013-10-11 20:20:18	Espyo	phew
2013-10-11 20:20:23	Espyo	and I think standing on the pillars is an intended mechanic
2013-10-11 20:20:39	Espyo	I noticed that if I'm on a pillar, at the end of the third boost, it ALWAYS hits the pillar
2013-10-11 20:20:46	Espyo	unless it hits the pillar before

2013-10-12 12:17:14	@J	.
2013-10-12 12:17:25	Espyo	hey
2013-10-12 12:18:10	@J	so you know I was writing a physics engine before, and I never quite got it working?
2013-10-12 12:18:20	@J	I had a new idea for how to do it
2013-10-12 12:18:29	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-12 12:18:47	@J	I'm going to try grouping objects within frames as they collide, then further collisions happen with the whole group
2013-10-12 12:19:10	Espyo	hm, good idea
2013-10-12 12:19:14	@J	since the main issue was infinite/very large loops of collisions with many nearby objects
2013-10-12 12:19:28	Espyo	what about ungrouping?
2013-10-12 12:19:35	Espyo	I think the logic on that might be a bit tough
2013-10-12 12:19:37	@J	it doesn't solve the issue of having an object between 2 walls with no gaps, then moving it towards a wall
2013-10-12 12:19:40	@J	it would bounce forever
2013-10-12 12:19:53	@J	no, I said, within frames - so once the frame ends, forget all groupings
2013-10-12 12:20:13	@J	I mean, it would bounce forever in zero time
2013-10-12 12:20:30	@J	not quite sure how best to detect that
2013-10-12 12:22:27	Espyo	that... wouldn't make stuff move

2013-10-12 12:23:33	Espyo	I thought grouping would be the way to save performance over time
2013-10-12 12:23:36	Espyo	not within a single frame
2013-10-12 12:23:48	Espyo	maybe it'll take longer to group than checking everything vs everything
2013-10-12 12:36:04	@J	no, it's within a single frame that you get way too many collisions
2013-10-12 12:36:31	@J	for example: 0 elasticity, 3 squares next to each other, the left one moves into the middle one
2013-10-12 12:36:51	@J	they don't bounce, so they repeatedly collide and distribute the momentum in pairs
2013-10-12 12:37:11	@J	if you group on the first collision, this takes like 2 collisions to resolve
2013-10-12 12:37:26	Espyo	but
2013-10-12 12:37:29	Espyo	grouping the collision
2013-10-12 12:37:31	@J	it's not so much a performance issue as an edge-case performance issue
2013-10-12 12:37:34	Espyo	will be a lot of work
2013-10-12 12:37:40	@J	not really
2013-10-12 12:37:44	Espyo	but you'll have to save the group somewhere
2013-10-12 12:37:52	Espyo	I think it's a whole bunch of small operations
2013-10-12 12:37:55	Espyo	which end up being a big one
2013-10-12 12:38:12	Espyo	though I suppose it'd be better when there are a lot of collisions going on
2013-10-12 12:38:18	Espyo	not so much with this example of 4
2013-10-12 12:38:21	@J	yes, that's exactly the problem situation
2013-10-12 12:38:34	@J	this wouldn't be 4 collisions, it would be an infinite number
2013-10-12 12:38:42	@J	if you don't see that, you need to think through the example
2013-10-12 12:42:44	Espyo	right
2013-10-12 12:43:48	@J	this is the velocity for each (identical) square, one line per collision, with [] around the colliding pair:
2013-10-12 12:43:51	@J	[1 0] 0 -> .5 .5 0
2013-10-12 12:43:51	@J	.5 [.5 0] -> .5 .25 .25
2013-10-12 12:43:51	@J	[.5 .25] .25 -> .375 .375 .25
2013-10-12 12:43:51	@J	.375 [.375 .25] -> .375 .3125 .3125
2013-10-12 12:44:14	@J	and so on
2013-10-12 12:44:21	Espyo	right, I see now
2013-10-12 12:44:50	Espyo	even still, I'm just visualizing that that bunch of operations will take longer
2013-10-12 12:44:57	Espyo	which, in retrospect, is absolutely ridiculous
2013-10-12 12:45:00	@J	than forever?
2013-10-12 12:45:18	Espyo	that's just it, I was seeing it wrong
2013-10-12 12:45:23	@J	right
2013-10-12 12:45:31	Espyo	well, hurry up and make that, because I wanna see videos of the first early attempts
2013-10-12 12:45:50	Espyo	where everything spazzes out of everything at the slightest touch
2013-10-12 12:45:58	@J	yep
2013-10-12 12:46:05	@J	I'll start after lunch, I guess
2013-10-12 12:46:18	Espyo	which lunch is this? the 3rd today?
2013-10-12 12:46:26	@J	why would you say that
2013-10-12 12:46:35	Espyo	you eat a lot
2013-10-12 12:46:37	Espyo	remember?
2013-10-12 12:46:59	@J	not unless overeating causes memory loss
2013-10-12 12:47:16	Espyo	then it must
2013-10-12 12:47:22	Espyo	maybe it's localized memory loss
2013-10-12 12:47:33	@J	localised to my brain
2013-10-12 12:54:29	@J	trying to delete a file
2013-10-12 12:54:35	@J	accidentally press backspace before delete
2013-10-12 12:55:52	Espyo	oh crud
2013-10-12 12:58:35	@J	I should say there's no confirmation dialogue
2013-10-12 12:59:02	@J	though to be fair if there were we know enter would instantly follow
2013-10-12 12:59:18	Espyo	that's precisely why I disabled mine
2013-10-12 13:03:15	@J	can you even do that on Windows?
2013-10-12 13:03:54	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-12 13:04:00	Espyo	shockingly enough
2013-10-12 13:04:06	Espyo	it's a bit funny how you do it
2013-10-12 13:04:11	Espyo	you right-click the recycling bin, properties
2013-10-12 13:04:19	Espyo	and there's a dialog box with only like 4 of them, one of them being the dialog
2013-10-12 13:04:28	Espyo	(the dialog appearing or not)
2013-10-12 13:23:26	@J	that doesn't even make sense
2013-10-12 13:23:37	Espyo	let me try again
2013-10-12 13:23:43	Espyo	right-click the recycling bin, properties
2013-10-12 13:23:45	@J	no, I mean, it makes sense
2013-10-12 13:23:48	Espyo	and a dialog with the del‚Äî
2013-10-12 13:23:49	@J	uh
2013-10-12 13:23:54	Espyo	just the way I put it?
2013-10-12 13:23:54	@J	what you said makes sense
2013-10-12 13:24:05	@J	but Windows is silly
2013-10-12 13:24:10	Espyo	oh, no doubt
2013-10-12 13:24:26	Espyo	I'm not sure if you can do it any other way than right-clicking the recycling bin and such

2013-10-12 17:12:31	@J	hmm, ideas for music in a game engine?
2013-10-12 17:12:41	@J	that is, beyond the very basics
2013-10-12 17:13:08	Espyo	...what do you mean
2013-10-12 17:13:09	@J	up until now, I've just had a setting to auto-discover and auto-play music in the music/ directory, and a volume
2013-10-12 17:13:28	Espyo	uh huh?
2013-10-12 17:13:36	@J	and
2013-10-12 17:13:51	@J	any ideas for things you might want to do with music?
2013-10-12 17:13:59	Espyo	I don't
2013-10-12 17:14:01	Espyo	you... play it?
2013-10-12 17:14:10	Espyo	I really don't understand what the question here is
2013-10-12 17:14:40	@J	for example with sounds, I have a system that loads up files with the same prefix and plays a random one when you play that prefix
2013-10-12 17:14:56	@J	eg. you have walk0.ogg, walk1.ogg, etc., and you do play_snd('walk')
2013-10-12 17:14:59	@J	and it plays one
2013-10-12 17:15:12	Espyo	right
2013-10-12 17:15:15	Espyo	Minecraft does that as well
2013-10-12 17:15:21	Espyo	more games should; I think the PFE will as well
2013-10-12 17:17:27	@J	but I'm not really sure how you might want music to work
2013-10-12 17:17:42	Espyo	well, a song for a level
2013-10-12 17:18:00	Espyo	don't think it'd be wise to think about making dynamic music so flexible
2013-10-12 17:18:08	Espyo	because there are a lot of things that can make a song change
2013-10-12 17:18:20	Espyo	you can't just have that be automated like that
2013-10-12 17:19:51	@J	I guess allow defining a fade out/back in when you play a specific track
2013-10-12 17:20:21	@J	and whether to loop or continue with the auto-playing thing at the end
2013-10-12 17:22:29	Espyo	hm
2013-10-12 17:22:30	Espyo	you mean like that
2013-10-12 17:22:32	Espyo	well yeah
2013-10-12 17:23:29	@J	yeah, I guess I'm talking 'organisation', if that makes sense
2013-10-12 17:24:08	@J	useful things for when/how to play stuff
2013-10-12 17:24:32	Espyo	I guess that's all, though
2013-10-12 17:24:51	@J	it would be nice to be able to group tracks, then refer to them by some group name
2013-10-12 17:25:00	@J	and the obvious way to organise that is separate directories
2013-10-12 17:25:10	@J	but then there's no good way to have one track in multiple gruops
2013-10-12 17:25:12	@J	*groups
2013-10-12 17:25:23	@J	well, not on Windows, anyway
2013-10-12 17:29:05	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-12 17:29:05	Espyo	but what'd be the use?
2013-10-12 17:30:05	@J	I don't know, is it that crazy to want to do that?
2013-10-12 17:30:27	Espyo	uh, I think windows supports symlinks (are those symlinks?)
2013-10-12 17:30:32	Espyo	it's /horrible/ at it, but it does
2013-10-12 17:30:59	@J	yes, but does it support symlinks stored in an archive?
2013-10-12 17:31:14	@J	and create them properly when you extract?
2013-10-12 17:31:21	Espyo	pffft
2013-10-12 17:31:22	Espyo	I'd bet no

2013-10-14 18:08:14	Espyo	do you remember what I said about being op?
2013-10-14 18:08:18	Espyo	it needs to be someone trustworthy
2013-10-14 18:08:26	Espyo	someone who spams is not looking for the best intentions of the channel
2013-10-14 18:08:31	Espyo	so if you keep spamming, you're never going to be op
2013-10-14 18:08:36	Espyo	not just here, you will never be op anywhere
2013-10-14 18:09:32	Marioguy123	yes

2013-10-14 18:10:50	Espyo	precisely
2013-10-14 18:10:52	Espyo	if you don't like it, leave
2013-10-14 18:10:56	Espyo	I already explained why
2013-10-14 18:10:59	Espyo	we are all busy
2013-10-14 18:11:06	Espyo	we stay here because sometimes there's time to takl
2013-10-14 18:11:08	Espyo	*talk
2013-10-14 18:11:10	Espyo	but not always
2013-10-14 18:11:24	Espyo	and if you're bored, you'll have to find entertainment elsewhere, because nobody can talk at the moment

2013-10-16 18:53:57	@J	beep
2013-10-16 18:58:12	Espyo	hey
2013-10-16 18:58:26	Espyo	so I decided to make it so that whenever Testyo disconnects, the console window on the taskbar blinks
2013-10-16 18:58:35	Espyo	this way it doesn't take me over 5 hours to realize he's gone on a network
2013-10-16 18:58:49	Espyo	VERY shockingly, it only took 2 lines of code to do that, and it worked right the first time
2013-10-16 18:59:03	Espyo	it's already shocking enough that a call to the windows API worked right away
2013-10-16 18:59:16	Espyo	what's even more shocking is that console windows don't really allow you to do much on windows
2013-10-16 18:59:25	Espyo	much that you can do on other windows, I mean
2013-10-16 18:59:30	Espyo	and it worked no problem
2013-10-16 18:59:42	Espyo	heh, windows is trying to pretend it's actually a good operative system
2013-10-16 18:59:48	Espyo	don't know who it's trying to fool
2013-10-16 19:11:19	Espyo	so I've searched for git plugins for visual studio
2013-10-16 19:11:25	Espyo	and found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/507343/using-git-with-visual-studio/507369#507369
2013-10-16 19:11:47	Espyo	one of the answers says that microsoft started developing an official plugin on January, and that it's done now
2013-10-16 19:12:09	Espyo	but that there's also a long-running plugin made by someone outside
2013-10-16 19:12:12	Espyo	so help me decide
2013-10-16 19:12:18	Espyo	should I pick the recent, but official plugin
2013-10-16 19:12:27	Espyo	or the trusty but unofficial one?
2013-10-16 19:12:35	@J	trusty?
2013-10-16 19:12:44	Espyo	well, it wasn't made by people from microsoft
2013-10-16 19:12:52	Espyo	so yes, it's more trustworthy to not crash my everything
2013-10-16 19:13:57	@J	OTOH, you're using VS
2013-10-16 19:14:04	Espyo	true, true
2013-10-16 19:14:09	@J	try both?
2013-10-16 19:14:13	@J	that's always an option
2013-10-16 19:14:21	Espyo	eeeeegggghhh... takes too long
2013-10-16 19:14:34	Espyo	hang on
2013-10-16 19:14:44	Espyo	on stackoverflow, the guy says the plugin is for VS2012
2013-10-16 19:14:53	Espyo	could also work for 2010, but he didn't specify
2013-10-16 19:15:00	Espyo	guess I'll go with the unofficial one then
2013-10-16 19:15:24	Espyo	at least I worked with git on NetBeans, so this shouldn't be too confusing

2013-10-16 20:04:17	Espyo	how come you never find the time to stick around?
2013-10-16 20:04:29	Espyo	isn't one just a redir now?
2013-10-16 20:04:44	PikFan	well
2013-10-16 20:04:55	PikFan	one of them is a misspelling
2013-10-16 20:05:03	Espyo	but it's a redir, right?
2013-10-16 20:05:11	PikFan	"Qauggled" or something
2013-10-16 20:05:19	Espyo	hehe, yeah
2013-10-16 20:05:22	PikFan	hm

2013-10-16 20:06:09	PikFan	I'm not using the computer at home as much as I used to
2013-10-16 20:06:19	PikFan	because of school

2013-10-16 20:32:01	Espyo	it'd crash the SQL server

2013-10-16 20:32:19	@J	that's because my ] key is a misbehaver

2013-10-16 20:35:32	Espyo	that thing
2013-10-16 20:35:42	Espyo	it's just DVORAK

2013-10-16 20:37:39	Espyo	I'm seeing all these MP2 runs...
2013-10-16 20:37:54	Espyo	I really don't remember the Temple Grounds theme having a maraca

2013-10-16 20:38:02	Espyo	or whatever that is
2013-10-16 20:40:03	Miles	What runs are you watching?
2013-10-16 20:40:26	Espyo	watched 2 on SDA: the any% and hard 100%
2013-10-16 20:40:32	Espyo	the 100% hard run is in French, so I'm guessing PAL
2013-10-16 20:40:43	Miles	Why
2013-10-16 20:40:45	Miles	Why
2013-10-16 20:40:52	Espyo	I know, they're ultra old
2013-10-16 20:40:53	Miles	Just, why
2013-10-16 20:40:56	Espyo	I wanna see what time did to them
2013-10-16 20:41:02	Espyo	so then I can watch how the most current runs fare
2013-10-16 20:41:16	Espyo	and to be fair, I'm just skimming through 100% hard
2013-10-16 20:41:17	Miles	Also there's a Hard 100%?
2013-10-16 20:41:23	Espyo	ah, crap
2013-10-16 20:41:24	Espyo	I mean any%
2013-10-16 20:41:48	Espyo	ugh, made sure not to type "100%" on the non-hard one
2013-10-16 20:41:51	Espyo	but did it on the hard one
2013-10-16 20:42:35	Espyo	Torvus Bog also sounds like it has some extra percussion
2013-10-16 20:45:45	@J	maybe the recording changed things a bit?
2013-10-16 20:45:54	Espyo	must've
2013-10-16 20:46:03	Espyo	maybe if I try listening to my own game with headphones...

2013-10-16 23:54:07	@J	it displays the image and the categories the page is already in

2013-10-16 23:54:18	Espyo	eh
2013-10-16 23:54:24	Espyo	the whole idea is pretty hacky anyway

2013-10-17 00:04:52	Espyo	is that what you wanted me to clean up?
2013-10-17 00:05:09	@J	yeah, by making the category

2013-10-17 00:05:27	@J	or choosing it should be another category?

2013-10-17 18:26:27	@J	I believe the most important time of day is upon us

2013-10-17 18:27:15	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-10-17 18:27:28	Espyo	well, the disconnect window blink won't do me any good if Testyo isn't even on
2013-10-17 18:30:51	@J	[18:26:39] Espyo  18:30
2013-10-17 18:30:55	@J	more importantly, food time
2013-10-17 18:30:59	Espyo	I figured
2013-10-17 18:31:02	Espyo	I had that one hour ago
2013-10-17 18:31:16	Espyo	kinda early for you to be here
2013-10-17 18:31:19	Espyo	when do you get off work?
2013-10-17 18:34:44	@J	6
2013-10-17 18:34:58	Espyo	hm
2013-10-17 18:35:00	Espyo	fair enough
2013-10-17 18:35:03	@J	I normally spend more time eating/making food before I get here
2013-10-17 18:35:12	@J	or I just don't bother talking until I'm done
2013-10-17 18:35:27	Espyo	oh, I'm not putting in question your religious eating habits
2013-10-17 18:35:29	@J	but this will take a long time to cook and took a couple of minutes to start
2013-10-17 18:35:42	Espyo	do you eat just a bit each time?
2013-10-17 18:35:49	@J	each time what?
2013-10-17 18:35:49	Espyo	either that, or your metabolism is not normal
2013-10-17 18:35:54	Espyo	each time you eat
2013-10-17 18:35:59	@J	no
2013-10-17 18:36:16	Espyo	you eat so much
2013-10-17 18:36:21	@J	I don't believe I've said anything to indicate I eat more than 3 meals per day
2013-10-17 18:36:21	Espyo	eh, guess that works for you
2013-10-17 18:36:29	Espyo	but
2013-10-17 18:36:34	Espyo	you keep saying you're going for a meal
2013-10-17 18:36:37	Espyo	wait, three?
2013-10-17 18:36:41	Espyo	that's already kinda messed up there
2013-10-17 18:36:48	Espyo	there's lunch and dinner
2013-10-17 18:36:50	@J	counting breakfast, obviously
2013-10-17 18:36:51	Espyo	unless you're counting breakfast
2013-10-17 18:37:00	Espyo	eh, I just have a glass of milk for breakfast
2013-10-17 18:37:15	Espyo	then again, my stomach hates me in the morning, so I'm not sure I should talk about breakfast
2013-10-17 18:38:17	@J	same - I hardly eat more than a normal-sized portion in the morning
2013-10-17 18:38:39	Espyo	portion of breakfast?
2013-10-17 18:38:42	Espyo	or portion of meal?
2013-10-17 18:39:00	@J	breakfast
2013-10-17 18:39:10	Espyo	oh
2013-10-17 18:39:11	@J	which is a meal
2013-10-17 18:39:16	Espyo	eeehhh
2013-10-17 18:39:17	Espyo	maybe
2013-10-17 18:41:06	@J	for normal people
2013-10-17 18:41:18	Espyo	eeehhh
2013-10-17 18:41:19	Espyo	maybe
2013-10-17 18:46:45	@J	normal people like me
2013-10-17 18:48:49	Espyo	http://thedoghousediaries.com/comics/uncategorized/2013-10-16-3da623e.png
2013-10-17 18:49:15	Espyo	if it weren't for the fact that you already had most of the code made, this would be true for your wiki image sorter thing
2013-10-17 18:53:57	@J	that's more a case of 'boring repetitive work' versus 'fun happy programming time'
2013-10-17 18:54:45	Espyo	I suppose
2013-10-17 19:01:37	@J	also makes future such jobs easier
2013-10-17 19:01:56	Espyo	if they ever exist
2013-10-17 19:02:22	@J	recategorisation?  We've done that loads of times
2013-10-17 19:04:38	Espyo	recategorisation of images
2013-10-17 19:11:19	@J	I wrote and fixed up a load of generic MediaWiki API calls, though
2013-10-17 19:14:01	Espyo	that's always good
2013-10-17 19:14:15	Espyo	I mean, the MediaWiki API in the future will probably be needed
2013-10-17 19:14:21	Espyo	but the image categorisation tiny program thing, not so much
2013-10-17 19:15:12	@J	it also helped me find game engine bugs
2013-10-17 19:15:35	@J	but that's pretty small, anyway - like I said, 100 lines
2013-10-17 19:15:39	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-17 19:15:44	Espyo	say, question
2013-10-17 19:16:11	Espyo	how would YOU do it? have a vector of mobs, or a vector of Pikmin + a vector of leaders + a vector of enemies + ...?
2013-10-17 19:16:41	Espyo	if all mobs are on the same vector, you just iterate over all of them, run their polymorphhsizied "tick" function, and be done with it
2013-10-17 19:17:14	Espyo	but the problem is that, for instance, if you want to check something between Pikmin and a treasure, you have to iterate everything just to get to the Pikmin/treasures
2013-10-17 19:17:24	@J	have both
2013-10-17 19:17:33	@J	one for all of them, plus separate vectors
2013-10-17 19:17:38	Espyo	having a vector for each fixes that, but you have a lot of fors, for all kinds of mobs
2013-10-17 19:17:42	Espyo	hmmmmmmmmmmmm
2013-10-17 19:17:49	Espyo	not really sure how great that'd be
2013-10-17 19:17:55	@J	very
2013-10-17 19:17:56	Espyo	not too worried about RAM usage
2013-10-17 19:18:06	Espyo	at the very max, it'd use up 100MB more
2013-10-17 19:18:08	Espyo	that's nothing
2013-10-17 19:18:16	Espyo	but something strikes me the wrong way with that
2013-10-17 19:19:11	@J	how
2013-10-17 19:19:15	@J	how could that happen?
2013-10-17 19:19:33	@J	did you mean 100k?
2013-10-17 19:20:09	Espyo	oops
2013-10-17 19:20:10	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-17 19:20:12	Espyo	ugh
2013-10-17 19:20:18	Espyo	hehehehe, 100MB
2013-10-17 19:20:23	Espyo	and they're all pointers, actually
2013-10-17 19:20:28	Espyo	I was thinking structures
2013-10-17 19:20:35	Espyo	but the vector of all mobs would just be filled with pointers
2013-10-17 19:20:45	Espyo	so 8*200 bytes?
2013-10-17 19:21:10	Espyo	 100 Pikmin... a lot of objects on the map... should be 200
2013-10-17 19:21:21	Espyo	yeah, just confirms even more that RAM-wise, it's tiny
2013-10-17 19:21:50	Espyo	but are you just saying you'd do both if it were up to you, or do you actually do that in places?
2013-10-17 19:24:30	@J	I would, and I think I have done
2013-10-17 19:24:46	Espyo	guess I'll give it a go
2013-10-17 19:25:02	@J	if I thought about it a bit longer, I would probably:
2013-10-17 19:25:35	@J	have one for each, and write a function which is a generator for an arbitrary set of types
2013-10-17 19:25:54	@J	that is, something you can iterate over
2013-10-17 19:26:02	@J	a lazy-evaluated list
2013-10-17 19:26:45	Espyo	...a list of mob*?
2013-10-17 19:27:04	@J	maybe?
2013-10-17 19:27:34	Espyo	well, it's the entire point
2013-10-17 19:27:39	Espyo	a list that points to all mobs
2013-10-17 19:27:48	Espyo	and a list that points to all Pikmin, one to all treasures, ...
2013-10-17 19:27:57	Espyo	to tick all mobs, you iterate over the list of mobs
2013-10-17 19:28:07	Espyo	but to check between particular mobs, you use the specialized lists
2013-10-17 19:28:33	@J	I don't understand what you meant by [19:26:45] Espyo ...a list of mob*?
2013-10-17 19:28:39	@J	in Python: http://sprunge.us/FKMV
2013-10-17 19:28:50	@J	http://sprunge.us/FKMV?py
2013-10-17 19:29:37	Espyo	well yeah, that's it
2013-10-17 19:29:44	Espyo	except from the looks of it, Python is not OO
2013-10-17 19:30:40	@J	in what sense?
2013-10-17 19:30:58	Espyo	there's no polymorphism
2013-10-17 19:31:05	Espyo	a Pikmin is a mob
2013-10-17 19:31:10	Espyo	so's a leader
2013-10-17 19:31:15	Espyo	Pikmin, mob and leader are all classes
2013-10-17 19:31:47	@J	I'm not sure how that code goes against that
2013-10-17 19:32:11	Espyo	I just can't grasp the concept of classes there
2013-10-17 19:32:15	Espyo	all I see is stuffs inside lists
2013-10-17 19:32:41	@J	because I didn't define any classes, I'm just saying A, B, etc. are objects (instances of classes)
2013-10-17 19:32:49	@J	doesn't matter what they are
2013-10-17 19:33:10	@J	as long as they can all tick(), and all pikmin and captains can die()
2013-10-17 19:33:20	@J	it's duck typing, really
2013-10-17 19:33:40	@J	rather than rigidly check for types, in Python you generally just try to do something, and if you can't, you moan about it
2013-10-17 19:35:32	Espyo	ah
2013-10-17 19:35:37	Espyo	ok then
2013-10-17 19:42:03	@J	anyway, that doesn't make any copies of things, and it allows you to apply better filtering later on if you so wish
2013-10-17 19:42:39	@J	I don't know how easy it is in C++, but you do have iterators, IIRC
2013-10-17 19:42:57	Espyo	is there any deterministic way to specify if something is a copy, a pointer, etc.?
2013-10-17 19:43:00	Espyo	and yeah, it's relatively easy in C++
2013-10-17 19:43:16	@J	[19:42:57] Espyo is there any deterministic way to specify if something is a copy, a pointer, etc.?
2013-10-17 19:43:18	@J	in what way?
2013-10-17 19:43:34	@J	are we talking about this scenario, programming in general, C++?
2013-10-17 19:43:39	Espyo	in general, Python
2013-10-17 19:43:43	@J	oh
2013-10-17 19:43:50	@J	what's a 'copy'?
2013-10-17 19:44:29	@J	or do you mean checking if two objects are actually a pointer to the same object, and not just copies?
2013-10-17 19:45:23	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-17 19:45:31	Espyo	the latter
2013-10-17 19:45:45	Espyo	is it just guessing?...ish?
2013-10-17 19:45:50	Espyo	I ask this because Javascript is basically that
2013-10-17 19:45:52	@J	you have identity and equality like in many languages, but it's done better than in, for example, JavaScript
2013-10-17 19:45:54	@J	heh
2013-10-17 19:46:03	Espyo	heh, exactly
2013-10-17 19:46:15	@J	you have 'x == y', which does a rich comparison to check if things are equivalent
2013-10-17 19:46:27	@J	you can define how this works on your objects, which I believe you also have in C++
2013-10-17 19:46:42	@J	then there's 'x is y', which checks if they're exactly the same object
2013-10-17 19:47:05	@J	this is equivalent to 'id(x) == id(y)', where id() returns a number derived from the memory address of an objcet
2013-10-17 19:47:09	@J	*object
2013-10-17 19:47:59	@J	...accidentally grilled a baked potato for a little while
2013-10-17 19:48:32	Espyo	ah
2013-10-17 19:51:41	@J	but yeah, JavaScript is fun
2013-10-17 19:51:47	@J	lack of multi-line strings kills me
2013-10-17 19:52:18	Espyo	multi-line strings?
2013-10-17 19:52:35	Espyo	"egh\nabc"?
2013-10-17 19:52:44	@J	multiple lines of code
2013-10-17 19:52:47	@J	"aoeu
2013-10-17 19:52:47	@J	aoeu2
2013-10-17 19:52:50	@J	*"
2013-10-17 19:52:53	Espyo	ah
2013-10-17 19:52:54	Espyo	but
2013-10-17 19:53:04	Espyo	"qwer" +
2013-10-17 19:53:06	Espyo	"ty";
2013-10-17 19:53:10	@J	horrible
2013-10-17 19:53:21	@J	what if you want to write a paragraph?
2013-10-17 19:53:22	Espyo	C++ can only do that as well

2013-10-17 20:22:44	Espyo	no no no no no no no no no no
2013-10-17 20:22:46	Espyo	nope
2013-10-17 20:22:48	Espyo	nuh-uh
2013-10-17 20:22:50	Espyo	not here
2013-10-17 20:22:57	Espyo	no sir, I wanna use sectors here
2013-10-17 20:23:09	Espyo	I don't think tiles would even work well with Pikmin
2013-10-17 20:23:13	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-17 20:23:17	Espyo	certainly wouldn't look as good
2013-10-17 20:23:57	Espyo	I think I want to simplify it, by making it so that if you want to move, it checks every line in your sector (every wall around you)
2013-10-17 20:24:06	Espyo	but Doom has so much more just for that
2013-10-17 20:24:09	Espyo	they must have it for a reason

2013-10-17 20:54:41	Espyo	but the .h is filled with PK Rhythm examples, and even states that it comes from that game
2013-10-17 20:54:48	Espyo	I'm not even sure if I should change that
2013-10-17 20:56:26	@J	...completely forgot we were having a conversation
2013-10-17 20:56:54	Espyo	we were?
2013-10-17 20:57:01	Espyo	oh, that was mostly rambling
2013-10-17 20:57:12	Espyo	Doom's sector things are a bit complex, so I wasn't expecting a reply
2013-10-17 20:57:15	Espyo	not that you wouldn't know, but
2013-10-17 20:57:16	Espyo	you don't know
2013-10-17 20:57:22	Espyo	heh
2013-10-17 20:57:29	Espyo	I mean, you never made a Doom map, have you?
2013-10-17 20:58:02	@J	no
2013-10-17 20:59:05	@J	still not sure what sectors are
2013-10-17 20:59:11	@J	rooms?
2013-10-17 20:59:44	Espyo	that's... it
2013-10-17 20:59:48	Espyo	I was trying to find a word
2013-10-17 20:59:50	Espyo	that's really it
2013-10-17 20:59:59	Espyo	a polygon, that's basically a room
2013-10-17 21:00:02	Espyo	its lines are walls
2013-10-17 21:00:06	Espyo	brb, dinner
2013-10-17 21:03:54	@J	not sure why you would want to group them into rooms
2013-10-17 21:03:56	@J	just define walls
2013-10-17 21:23:22	Espyo	floor textures
2013-10-17 21:23:33	Espyo	also Z of the floor
2013-10-17 21:24:37	@J	rooms still doesn't seem a good fit for outdoors areas
2013-10-17 21:24:49	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-17 21:24:56	Espyo	ok, let me try explaining it in another way
2013-10-17 21:30:55	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/sectors.png this is it, Doom sectors in a nutshell
2013-10-17 21:35:30	@J	okay, so when you say walls, not actual solid walls
2013-10-17 21:35:36	@J	I see
2013-10-17 21:35:54	Espyo	it's really easier to explain with something like this

2013-10-17 21:55:55	@J	so, what exactly do you think we should put in these image categories?

2013-10-17 21:56:13	@J	also concept art based on which game it was released with?
2013-10-17 21:56:34	@J	also promotional stuff?  Model images?  Beta things?
2013-10-17 21:57:09	Espyo	not just screenshots
2013-10-17 21:57:18	Espyo	anything that's directly related, I guess
2013-10-17 21:58:24	@J	those examples?

2013-10-17 21:59:36	Espyo	hmmmmm
2013-10-17 21:59:45	Espyo	maybe... not? to avoid inflation
2013-10-17 22:44:04	Espyo	well, a simple test area file with just one sector, with 5 lines, is 22 lines long
2013-10-17 22:46:37	@J	how
2013-10-17 22:46:51	Espyo	http://mibpaste.com/JadNuF 
2013-10-17 22:46:59	Espyo	these are meant to be edited with a tool, anyway, but
2013-10-17 22:47:23	Espyo	oh, I don't have floor data
2013-10-17 22:47:24	Espyo	more lines

2013-10-17 22:49:11	@J	best image
2013-10-17 22:49:29	@J	oh, because }s
2013-10-17 22:49:40	@J	also Mibbit's paste is making me sad
2013-10-17 22:49:53	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-17 22:50:04	Espyo	they should fix it already
2013-10-17 22:50:10	Espyo	but I think they're all asleep
2013-10-17 22:50:15	Espyo	last Mibbit update was... years ago
2013-10-17 22:50:21	@J	aren't those points, now lines?
2013-10-17 22:50:33	Espyo	wow, that's so big
2013-10-17 22:50:41	Espyo	yeah, I haven't gotten the concept down right yet
2013-10-17 22:50:46	Espyo	right now a line is just... a point
2013-10-17 22:50:55	@J	I don't get why it's not just 'sector\n\t0 0\n\t100 0\n\t...'
2013-10-17 22:51:03	Espyo	I don't remember the Scorch Guard being held by an Emperor Bulblax
2013-10-17 22:51:08	Espyo	or is that the Rocket Fist or whatever?
2013-10-17 22:51:52	Espyo	because the data inside a {} thing (damn, words missing) is not mandatory
2013-10-17 22:51:59	Espyo	so you have to specify WHAT is worth how much
2013-10-17 22:52:05	@J	worth?
2013-10-17 22:52:13	Espyo	z is worth 0, for instance
2013-10-17 22:52:23	Espyo	I really can't words right now
2013-10-17 22:52:25	@J	so you're saying x and y have defaluts?
2013-10-17 22:52:29	Espyo	yes
2013-10-17 22:52:29	@J	*defaults
2013-10-17 22:52:33	Espyo	even if it makes no sense
2013-10-17 22:52:34	@J	which are what?
2013-10-17 22:52:37	Espyo	'
2013-10-17 22:52:38	Espyo	...
2013-10-17 22:52:39	Espyo	*0
2013-10-17 22:52:42	@J	...
2013-10-17 22:52:44	Espyo	but it's not about x and y
2013-10-17 22:52:47	Espyo	it's about everything else
2013-10-17 22:52:51	Espyo	every data file follows this format
2013-10-17 22:52:57	Espyo	and a LOT of thing must have defaults
2013-10-17 22:53:02	Espyo	like the floor texture
2013-10-17 22:53:17	Espyo	I'll make it so it's translatable, scalable and rotateable
2013-10-17 22:53:23	Espyo	but they should have default values
2013-10-17 23:03:58	@J	so I'm up to images starting with '3'
2013-10-17 23:04:35	Espyo	those shouldn't even exist
2013-10-17 23:04:39	Espyo	some of our filenames...
2013-10-17 23:05:42	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:3_Pikmin_165155s.jpg
2013-10-17 23:05:47	@J	so...what actually _is_ this?
2013-10-17 23:05:59	Espyo	there's clearly more than 3 Pikmin on that picture
2013-10-17 23:06:05	Espyo	funnily enough though, there're 33
2013-10-17 23:06:20	Espyo	ok, so...
2013-10-17 23:06:28	Espyo	uh, that's the Mushroom Pikmin glitch
2013-10-17 23:06:31	Espyo	...in the beta version
2013-10-17 23:07:19	@J	some numbers are fair enough
2013-10-17 23:07:23	@J	like treasure hoard numbers
2013-10-17 23:07:28	@J	or Piklopedia numbers
2013-10-17 23:07:37	@J	except all the Pikmin are dancing
2013-10-17 23:07:39	@J	Olimar too
2013-10-17 23:08:14	Espyo	right
2013-10-17 23:08:26	Espyo	their... arms
2013-10-17 23:08:30	Espyo	didn't notice at first
2013-10-17 23:08:47	Espyo	I think no description is honestly the best description
2013-10-17 23:14:30	Espyo	oh, did you have your sound up when you tried the engine?

2013-10-17 23:41:40	@J	you know, this categorisation program/game thing is actually kind of addictive

2013-10-18 21:26:43	Espyo	that image was probably meant to...
2013-10-18 21:26:47	Espyo	uh, it's self-explanatory, actually
2013-10-18 21:27:16	Espyo	that reminds me, I ripped the hazard icons used on cave entrance dialog boxes
2013-10-18 21:27:30	@J	yeah, I get what it was meant to do
2013-10-18 21:27:38	@J	but it's still silly and I want to delete them
2013-10-18 21:27:46	@J	also, we have lots of horrible filenames
2013-10-18 21:28:08	Marioguy123	hi espyo
2013-10-18 21:29:18	Marioguy123	im not sure what this is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTL_sJycQAA
2013-10-18 21:29:19	Espyo	hi
2013-10-18 21:29:24	Marioguy123	or why im whatching it
2013-10-18 21:29:24	Espyo	it's a video
2013-10-18 21:29:27	Marioguy123	hay espyo
2013-10-18 21:29:29	Espyo	it's interesting
2013-10-18 21:29:33	Marioguy123	hwos the game going
2013-10-18 21:29:36	Marioguy123	good?
2013-10-18 21:29:39	Espyo	goodish
2013-10-18 21:29:40	Marioguy123	how are you
2013-10-18 21:29:47	Espyo	kinda having trouble drawing the area, not sure how
2013-10-18 21:29:48	Espyo	I'm good, you?
2013-10-18 21:29:54	Marioguy123	fine,thanks
2013-10-18 21:29:56	Espyo	J: delete those buttons
2013-10-18 21:29:59	Espyo	images
2013-10-18 21:29:59	Espyo	things
2013-10-18 21:30:20	Marioguy123	Hay ummm....is olimar a captian you can play as in the game?
2013-10-18 21:30:35	Espyo	it's an engine
2013-10-18 21:30:39	Marioguy123	ok
2013-10-18 21:30:44	Espyo	if the person who uses the engine to make a game include Olimar, then yes
2013-10-18 21:30:49	Marioguy123	ok
2013-10-18 21:31:01	Marioguy123	espyo,im not going to bug you if your busy
2013-10-18 21:31:59	Marioguy123	I hope your having a good(better day)day then me
2013-10-18 21:32:41	@J	drawing the area?
2013-10-18 21:33:20	Marioguy123	im actually (failing but)making my own engine
2013-10-18 21:35:06	Espyo	ok, because drawing primitives (the sectors) every time each frame is absolutely atrocious, I'll pre-render the area on a buffer
2013-10-18 21:35:14	Espyo	but areas are gigantic, so I have to use several buffers
2013-10-18 21:35:22	Espyo	several 800x800 images work
2013-10-18 21:35:39	Espyo	problem is, for some reason, it's not drawing the sectors on the image correctly
2013-10-18 21:35:42	Espyo	the translation's wrong, somehow
2013-10-18 21:36:09	Marioguy123	im made my own pikmin engine
2013-10-18 21:36:48	Marioguy123	it works
2013-10-18 21:36:59	Marioguy123	and has a small map 1 pikmin and olimar
2013-10-18 21:40:35	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/6/66/More.jpg ?
2013-10-18 21:40:59	@J	oh, you mean having your engine draw the sector
2013-10-18 21:41:06	@J	I had no context at all, so...
2013-10-18 21:41:36	Espyo	right
2013-10-18 21:41:44	Espyo	pfft
2013-10-18 21:41:48	Espyo	hey, that day counter on the corner
2013-10-18 21:41:52	Espyo	how weird, never saw that
2013-10-18 21:42:02	@J	yeah, probably beta
2013-10-18 21:42:13	Marioguy123	beta
2013-10-18 21:42:16	@J	I can't tell what area that is
2013-10-18 21:42:23	@J	if it is in the final game at all
2013-10-18 21:42:26	Espyo	seems like the only area they had at the time
2013-10-18 21:42:36	Espyo	it's in the ISO, I think
2013-10-18 21:42:38	Marioguy123	hay espyo
2013-10-18 21:42:40	Espyo	area6 or some such?
2013-10-18 21:42:55	Marioguy123	here is some advise
2013-10-18 21:42:59	Marioguy123	OBEY WEEGEE
2013-10-18 21:43:06	@J	the description page has no description, and it's unused and tiny
2013-10-18 21:43:18	@J	which game, though?
2013-10-18 21:43:27	Espyo	has to be P1
2013-10-18 21:43:29	@J	that was what I was after
2013-10-18 21:43:33	@J	reasoning?
2013-10-18 21:43:57	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x245evHAhQ
2013-10-18 21:44:00	Espyo	the day counter
2013-10-18 21:44:08	Espyo	(even without the video, my reasoning was still the day counter)
2013-10-18 21:44:15	Espyo	(in early stages of Pikmin, they had no idea where to put it)
2013-10-18 21:44:40	Espyo	(in early stages of Pikmin 2, they knew putting the day number in a bubble was the way to go, despite whatever other HUD decisions they'd have to face)
2013-10-18 21:47:48	Marioguy123	....
2013-10-18 21:52:02	Espyo	...don't tell me I can't play midis just because the engine's window is paused in debug mode
2013-10-18 21:52:35	Marioguy123	hay espyo,are you leaving a thing 
2013-10-18 21:52:40	Espyo	huh?
2013-10-18 21:52:44	Marioguy123	secret code to get on the debug menu
2013-10-18 21:53:00	Espyo	you can debug when programming
2013-10-18 21:53:07	Marioguy123	IK
2013-10-18 21:53:12	Marioguy123	 but when you playing
2013-10-18 21:53:21	Marioguy123	like on sonic2 and 3
2013-10-18 21:53:41	Marioguy123	you could turn into eny object playing the game
2013-10-18 21:53:46	Espyo	yeah, I know
2013-10-18 21:53:50	Marioguy123	and place it down
2013-10-18 21:53:51	Espyo	this is a bit like that
2013-10-18 21:53:52	Espyo	but not quite
2013-10-18 21:53:53	Marioguy123	then resume
2013-10-18 21:53:57	Marioguy123	ok then
2013-10-18 21:53:59	Marioguy123	good luck
2013-10-18 21:54:06	Espyo	also, NO, I /can't/ play MIDIs when it's paused
2013-10-18 21:54:11	Espyo	good job, windows
2013-10-18 21:54:13	Espyo	as per usual
2013-10-18 21:54:19	Marioguy123	(i thought of that whatching this vid http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdTPOp3mHk)
2013-10-18 21:54:24	Marioguy123	(that question)
2013-10-18 21:54:33	Marioguy123	if your making it now,good luck
2013-10-18 21:54:37	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Nectar.JPG
2013-10-18 21:54:41	@J	I'm going to say 1?
2013-10-18 21:54:43	Marioguy123	if not,good luck with what your doing

2013-10-18 22:05:04	Espyo	that Olimar REALLY looks like Pikmin 1
2013-10-18 22:05:09	Espyo	but I'm very inclined to say Pikmin 2

2013-10-18 23:46:21	Espyo	great
2013-10-18 23:46:28	Espyo	you finishing spawned Los_Plagas
2013-10-18 23:46:38	Los_Plagas	Wonderful.
2013-10-18 23:48:53	Los_Plagas	I was taking to Testyo last time.
2013-10-18 23:48:58	Los_Plagas	And he was really smart...
2013-10-18 23:49:05	Los_Plagas	Until another user and I told him so.
2013-10-18 23:49:08	Los_Plagas	Seriously.
2013-10-18 23:49:29	Los_Plagas	We were talking about something, and he said, "This is off-topic, but..."
2013-10-18 23:49:46	Los_Plagas	I cNt remember what he said, but he acknowledged that it was off-topic.
2013-10-18 23:50:01	Espyo	hehe
2013-10-18 23:50:17	Los_Plagas	And, I told him to kill that other user, and he said, "I know what I must do."
2013-10-18 23:50:57	Espyo	remember you can save any moment you deem unique
2013-10-18 23:51:04	Espyo	"Testyo save moment <search term> <number of lines>"
2013-10-18 23:51:19	@J	okay, now you have to create the Pikmin 2/3 categories
2013-10-18 23:52:18	Los_Plagas	How did I forget?!
2013-10-18 23:52:28	Los_Plagas	That was such a wonderful, wonderful moment...
2013-10-18 23:52:45	Espyo	sure thing
2013-10-18 23:53:35	@J	don't you have logs from Testyo?
2013-10-18 23:54:14	Los_Plagas	I'm actually quite surprised Espyo didn't notice the moment I was talking about - he's seen much less noticeable things for sure.
2013-10-18 23:54:46	Espyo	well that was easy
2013-10-18 23:54:52	Espyo	I have
2013-10-18 23:54:57	Espyo	but I guess I was too busy at that time
2013-10-18 23:55:03	Espyo	actually no, Testyo doesn't save the logs
2013-10-18 23:55:06	Espyo	Mibbit does, though
2013-10-18 23:55:08	Espyo	I'll take a look
2013-10-19 00:03:39	@J	so the only failures I've ended up with are pages with no categories and audio files it tried to display as images
2013-10-19 00:04:08	Espyo	hehehehe
2013-10-19 00:04:45	@J	oh, and redirects
2013-10-19 00:05:11	Espyo	right
2013-10-19 00:05:21	Espyo	it's really obvious in hindsight
2013-10-19 00:06:16	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Healing_Cask_%28NTSC%29_1_texture.png
2013-10-19 00:06:22	@J	and also that one for seemingly no reason
2013-10-19 00:06:52	Espyo	too long?
2013-10-19 00:07:02	Espyo	I don't suppose it's because of the parenthesis
2013-10-19 00:10:18	Espyo	ok, so
2013-10-19 00:10:27	Espyo	oops, this isn't #Testyo
2013-10-19 00:11:53	@J	no, lots of others have ()
2013-10-19 00:19:24	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Forged_Courage&action=history
2013-10-19 00:19:28	@J	...I don't remember doing that
2013-10-19 00:21:26	Espyo	the entire history?
2013-10-19 00:21:35	@J	yeah...
2013-10-19 00:21:53	@J	okay, my rough estimate of the number of edits I made is 1230
2013-10-19 00:21:56	Espyo	oh
2013-10-19 00:21:57	Espyo	woah
2013-10-19 00:22:16	@J	and obviously I actually viewed every single image on the wiki
2013-10-19 00:22:43	Espyo	right
2013-10-19 00:24:13	@J	Conky says I've downloaded 3.2GiB today, and I can only attribute ~1.6GiB to other things
2013-10-19 00:24:26	Espyo	hm?
2013-10-19 00:24:49	@J	but...I guess that can't be just Pikipedia
2013-10-19 00:28:10	@J	BTW, there's a thing I found for Windows called AltDrag
2013-10-19 00:28:15	@J	you should use it
2013-10-19 00:28:45	@J	it lets you move windows with alt-left-click anywhere on the window, and resize with middle/right-click
2013-10-19 00:28:51	@J	and scroll windows that aren't focused
2013-10-19 00:31:37	Espyo	well, I don't really move windows much
2013-10-19 00:31:39	Espyo	like, at all
2013-10-19 00:31:45	Espyo	so even though it sound interesti‚Äî
2013-10-19 00:31:49	Espyo	>and scroll windows that aren't focused
2013-10-19 00:31:51	Espyo	GIVE ME IT
2013-10-19 00:31:52	Espyo	NOW
2013-10-19 00:32:16	@J	[00:31:37] Espyo well, I don't really move windows much
2013-10-19 00:32:16	Espyo	I cannot live another single day knowing that thing exists and I'm not using it
2013-10-19 00:32:20	@J	that's kind of weird
2013-10-19 00:32:26	Espyo	they're always where I want them to
2013-10-19 00:32:30	Espyo	Firefox: maximized
2013-10-19 00:32:31	@J	also, if you just want that part, KatMouse does it too
2013-10-19 00:32:33	Espyo	VS: maximized
2013-10-19 00:32:39	Espyo	uh... everything else: fine as it is
2013-10-19 00:32:49	@J	hmm, fair enough
2013-10-19 00:32:56	@J	I find myself moving windows around quite a lot
2013-10-19 00:33:35	@J	you probably already know this, but maybe you would benefit from a virtual desktop/workspace thing too
2013-10-19 00:33:49	Espyo	the problem is that I am really not fond of the idea of having an extra program lying around to fix a stupidity windows is responsible for
2013-10-19 00:33:54	Espyo	using up my RAM and CPU
2013-10-19 00:34:07	Los_Plagas	I know how you feel.
2013-10-19 00:34:16	Espyo	how would I benefit from a VM?
2013-10-19 00:34:28	Los_Plagas	As part of my homework a year or two ago, I had to run  an evolution simulator on my computer
2013-10-19 00:35:18	Los_Plagas	So, the next morning, after a night of running, I officially had three generations of creatures. And each generation consisted of twenty creatures. s
2013-10-19 00:35:38	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-19 00:35:40	Espyo	that's kinda neat
2013-10-19 00:37:17	Los_Plagas	The website for it is down, but here's an archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20110207195710/http://stellaralchemy.com/lee/index.php
2013-10-19 00:37:29	Los_Plagas	It's called 3DVCE
2013-10-19 00:37:52	Espyo	ah
2013-10-19 00:37:59	Espyo	heh, Garry's Mod was around back then?
2013-10-19 00:38:12	@J	I thought it's been around for many years
2013-10-19 00:38:13	Espyo	oh, this snapshot's from 2011
2013-10-19 00:38:17	@J	[00:33:54] Espyo using up my RAM and CPU
2013-10-19 00:38:23	@J	these are pretty lightweight things
2013-10-19 00:38:27	@J	[00:34:16] Espyo how would I benefit from a VM?
2013-10-19 00:38:34	Espyo	combine that with all the other lightweight things I have
2013-10-19 00:38:37	@J	no, not a VM - just look up VirtuaWin
2013-10-19 00:38:52	Espyo	if this were a GOOD operative system, I wouldn't even have any of these hacky programs
2013-10-19 00:38:56	Espyo	I'd save up a good percentage of CPU usage
2013-10-19 00:39:02	@J	well, it's obviously your choice
2013-10-19 00:39:09	@J	but I don't think you'll notice a difference
2013-10-19 00:39:17	Espyo	I know, I know
2013-10-19 00:39:18	@J	there's also another one I forget the name of
2013-10-19 00:39:19	Espyo	but when I really need it
2013-10-19 00:39:24	@J	begins with D and contains an X, maybe?
2013-10-19 00:39:25	Espyo	like a MVM boss fight in TF2
2013-10-19 00:39:32	Espyo	it could make the difference between 10FPS and 9FPS
2013-10-19 00:39:34	Los_Plagas	And Apple is way too expensive, especially since they're based on California, and you're in Portugal....
2013-10-19 00:39:35	Espyo	and me winning or losing
2013-10-19 00:39:40	Espyo	hm, right
2013-10-19 00:39:47	Espyo	but I'd sooner use Linux than Mac
2013-10-19 00:39:51	Espyo	I hate windows because it's horribly made
2013-10-19 00:39:54	Espyo	Linux is well made
2013-10-19 00:39:55	Los_Plagas	Assuming Apple is good, anyway, which I don't know for sure...
2013-10-19 00:40:02	Espyo	I just don't use it because not much is around for it (of the things I use)
2013-10-19 00:40:07	Espyo	also I can never find the time to "learn" it
2013-10-19 00:40:15	@J	Dexpot
2013-10-19 00:40:22	Espyo	hm, let's see then
2013-10-19 00:40:44	Espyo	...KatMouse, I don't want you to steal EVERYTHING from my mouse wheel
2013-10-19 00:40:58	@J	?
2013-10-19 00:41:14	Espyo	KatMouse's a bit weird
2013-10-19 00:41:18	Espyo	it scrolls background windows
2013-10-19 00:41:28	Espyo	and it does some weird thing with a mouse wheel click
2013-10-19 00:41:35	@J	yeah, that was the point, wasn't it?
2013-10-19 00:41:50	@J	scrolling windows you're hovering over but which aren't focused
2013-10-19 00:41:54	Espyo	right, right
2013-10-19 00:42:01	Espyo	but not doing a weird mouse wheel /click/ steal thing
2013-10-19 00:42:15	@J	not sure what that is, but there's probably an option for it
2013-10-19 00:42:30	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-19 00:42:41	Espyo	so middle-clicking a window pushes it down on the window Z-order
2013-10-19 00:43:10	Espyo	ah, there we go
2013-10-19 00:43:16	Espyo	I can actually disable specifically that
2013-10-19 00:44:45	Espyo	ok, I'm /really/ starting to get pissed off at Firefox no longer searching on Google when you type something on the url bar
2013-10-19 00:44:54	Espyo	now it just mirrors the search bar right next to it
2013-10-19 00:45:06	Espyo	I even installed an addon that makes it return to its old behavior, but it keeps not working
2013-10-19 00:45:48	@J	it doesn't?
2013-10-19 00:45:52	@J	what does it do?
2013-10-19 00:46:08	@J	(I don't understand [00:44:54] Espyo now it just mirrors the search bar right next to it)
2013-10-19 00:46:09	Espyo	oh, I get now what you meant by virtual desktop/workspace
2013-10-19 00:46:16	Espyo	nope, that really isn't of much use to me, tbh
2013-10-19 00:46:46	Espyo	ok, so some versions ago, you could set what the awesome bar (the URL bar) did when you didn't provide a url
2013-10-19 00:46:52	Espyo	this setting was in about:config
2013-10-19 00:47:04	Espyo	and one of the possible values is a lookup of what you wrote on a custom URL
2013-10-19 00:47:13	Espyo	a lot of people had it to search on Google
2013-10-19 00:47:20	Espyo	and the best thing is that it didn't just search
2013-10-19 00:47:45	<--	Los_Plagas (Mibbit@wiwn-umbipe8.dsl.mindspring.com) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2013-10-19 00:47:46	Espyo	unless what you wrote was very ambiguous (not quite sure how that's measured), it would instantly open the first google result
2013-10-19 00:47:50	Espyo	like an I'm Feeling Lucky
2013-10-19 00:48:01	Espyo	eventually, some version of Firefox, maybe 20, removed that
2013-10-19 00:48:14	Espyo	and now the URL bar just does exactly what the search bar does, when you don't provide a URL
2013-10-19 00:48:24	Espyo	it literally searches using the currently selected search engine on the search bar
2013-10-19 00:48:29	Espyo	you might as well not even have the search bar
2013-10-19 00:48:48	Espyo	and the old "bring me the first Google result page, or search page if ambiguous" behavior is gone
2013-10-19 00:49:01	Espyo	an addon was made to restore it, but every once in a while, it stops working for some reason
2013-10-19 00:50:35	@J	so you just add a 'Google I'm Feeling Lucky' search engine and set that as your default search engine
2013-10-19 00:50:57	@J	or, better yet, set DuckDuckGo as your default search engine, then every search engine is available from the bar
2013-10-19 00:51:12	@J	!g google search
2013-10-19 00:51:25	@J	!gifl google with IFL
2013-10-19 00:51:29	@J	!w Wikipedia
2013-10-19 00:51:30	Espyo	don't understand the DuckDuckGo comment
2013-10-19 00:51:37	@J	I'm demonstrating it
2013-10-19 00:51:45	Espyo	oh
2013-10-19 00:51:47	Espyo	right, I see
2013-10-19 00:51:51	Espyo	no, that's actually not needed
2013-10-19 00:51:58	@J	it has so many things that half the time you can just guess
2013-10-19 00:51:59	Espyo	Firefox has a built-in thing where you can set keywords for search engine
2013-10-19 00:52:08	@J	!code blah
2013-10-19 00:52:13	@J	!define thing
2013-10-19 00:52:16	@J	!thesaurus
2013-10-19 00:52:17	@J	etc.
2013-10-19 00:52:26	Espyo	have, for instance, SmashWiki with the keyword "sw", and on the URL bar, you just type "sw Final Smash"
2013-10-19 00:52:41	Espyo	also, I would like to /not/ have to type "!g " nor "!gifl " every time I want to search
2013-10-19 00:52:49	Espyo	I want to just type my thing and get it over with, like the good old times
2013-10-19 00:52:55	Espyo	 00:50	J	so you just add a 'Google I'm Feeling Lucky' search engine and set that as your default search engine
2013-10-19 00:53:00	@J	yeah, basically the same thing, except this is a list maintained without any work on your part
2013-10-19 00:53:09	Espyo	if I switch search engines, which I do not uncommonly, I'd have to switch back
2013-10-19 00:53:10	@J	so it contains everything you never thought of

2013-10-19 00:53:25	@J	no, I think you can set your URL bar search engine separately
2013-10-19 00:53:29	Espyo	right, but it has an extra exclamation mark
2013-10-19 00:53:34	@J	that's what I meant by 'default'

2013-10-19 17:25:18	@J	okay, I managed to modify my (laptop's) screen-locker script so that the remote WeeChat (running on my Raspberry Pi) changes my status to away
2013-10-19 17:25:25	@J	it's quite hacky...
2013-10-19 17:26:13	@J	there's a WeeChat script that detects when a process called 'slock' is running
2013-10-19 17:26:37	@J	so I wrote a C program that does nothing with the name 'slock', and ran over SSH
2013-10-19 17:27:06	Espyo	hehe
2013-10-19 17:27:18	Espyo	can't you just edit the script to search for another process name?
2013-10-19 17:28:57	@J	yeah, but I would still need to run a process with that name either way
2013-10-19 17:29:02	@J	I mean
2013-10-19 17:29:03	@J	oh, wait
2013-10-19 17:29:12	@J	you get that slock is actually my screen locker, right?
2013-10-19 17:29:20	@J	only issue is it runs locally, not remotely
2013-10-19 17:29:38	@J	I used to just use the script as it is when I was running WeeChat locally
2013-10-19 17:29:45	Espyo	ah
2013-10-19 17:29:59	Espyo	I figured slock would be something like that, but
2013-10-19 17:30:11	Espyo	and, from what I gather, when slock runs, you also make it run a dummy slock remotely
2013-10-19 17:31:52	@J	yes
2013-10-19 17:32:01	@J	and make sure to stop it afterwards
2013-10-19 17:33:47	Espyo	right
2013-10-19 17:33:58	Espyo	it's hacky, but it's just about the only thing you can do
2013-10-19 17:34:49	@J	I think it'll also end up setting my status when I don't have the connection to WeeChat open
2013-10-19 17:34:59	@J	but I think if I set my status manually, the script won't change anything
2013-10-19 17:35:02	@J	let me check
2013-10-19 17:35:33	@J	yeah, seems it doesn't

2013-10-19 18:11:45	@J	hmm, so this method defines a class whose parent class is the class of the instance, and then returns an instance of it
2013-10-19 18:14:59	Espyo	hm, let me let that sink in
2013-10-19 18:15:52	Espyo	nope, can't
2013-10-19 18:17:01	@J	in pseudo-code:
2013-10-19 18:17:02	@J	class A
2013-10-19 18:17:02	@J	    method f
2013-10-19 18:17:02	@J	        class B inherits from A
2013-10-19 18:17:02	@J	            ...
2013-10-19 18:17:02	@J	        return new B
2013-10-19 18:18:17	Espyo	so I'll have to resort to "what"
2013-10-19 18:19:32	Espyo	ah, makes sense
2013-10-19 18:19:32	Espyo	it's just that in C++ you can't really define classes inside functions
2013-10-19 18:19:32	Espyo	at all
2013-10-19 18:19:32	Espyo	you can define structures, but even then, they're not recognized on the outside
2013-10-19 18:20:20	@J	yeah, I don't think it's that common
2013-10-19 18:20:36	@J	in Python you can define anything in any scope
2013-10-19 18:21:07	@J	you can just put random code inside a class definition
2013-10-19 18:23:39	@J	also, what this class (B) actually does is map every attribute onto the instance of A, except for a few it keeps separate copies of
2013-10-19 18:24:18	@J	so whenever you call a method on the returned instance (new B), it runs code in class A, but using some different attributes

2013-10-19 20:48:00	@J	[20:37:12] @Espyo if Testyo gets abused again, though, I will make sure someone pays
2013-10-19 20:48:07	@J	pfft, clearly you just need to fix Testyo

2013-10-19 20:48:24	ThePikminMeister	Hi J
2013-10-19 20:48:37	Mariostar123	hi J
2013-10-19 20:48:45	Los_Plagas	It's called Serious Mode.
2013-10-19 20:49:24	Mariostar123	what is?
2013-10-19 20:49:45	Los_Plagas	<J>: pfft, clearly you just need to fix Testyo
2013-10-19 20:50:21	@Espyo	I know I do
2013-10-19 20:50:25	@Espyo	but it's easier to block him
2013-10-19 20:50:28	@Espyo	or hand out free kicks
2013-10-19 20:50:30	Mariostar123	brb
2013-10-19 20:50:37	ThePikminMeister	Espyo
2013-10-19 20:50:42	@Espyo	yes?
2013-10-19 20:50:45	Los_Plagas	It's impossible to "hand out" kicks, free or not.
2013-10-19 20:50:51	ThePikminMeister	How is the engine coming along?
2013-10-19 20:51:00	Los_Plagas	Since they /are/ delivered with your feet.
2013-10-19 20:51:16	@Espyo	pretty well
2013-10-19 20:51:29	@Espyo	I can hand out the notion of a kick
2013-10-19 20:51:30	ThePikminMeister	What has been done so far?
2013-10-19 20:51:40	@Espyo	quite a bit
2013-10-19 20:51:44	@Espyo	Pikmin move around, so do leaders
2013-10-19 20:51:55	@Espyo	they follow the leaders, and can be made to carry treasures
2013-10-19 20:52:02	@Espyo	the HUD's all done, sound effects are done
2013-10-19 20:52:09	@Espyo	hmm, there should be more on the topic
2013-10-19 20:52:11	Los_Plagas	Is there a difference between that in Pikmin 2?
2013-10-19 20:52:11	ThePikminMeister	Is it possible to create leaders?
2013-10-19 20:52:21	@J	oh yeah, I noticed you didn't use the makefile?
2013-10-19 20:52:22	Los_Plagas	Do you have any screenshots? 
2013-10-19 20:52:25	@PikFan	what was that thing about a captain trying to go somewhere he's already in
2013-10-19 20:52:31	@Espyo	yeah, it should be possible to create anything when this is ready
2013-10-19 20:52:33	@Espyo	any kind of leader you want
2013-10-19 20:52:35	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2013-10-19 20:52:42	ThePikminMeister	I have another game idea
2013-10-19 20:52:46	@Espyo	I
2013-10-19 20:52:46	ThePikminMeister	With custom captains
2013-10-19 20:52:49	@Espyo	was I meant to use the makefile?
2013-10-19 20:52:50	@Espyo	what for?
2013-10-19 20:53:05	@PikFan	*captain trying to go somewhere he's already reached
2013-10-19 20:53:37	@Espyo	that was more about any mob trying to reach a spot it's alreadythere
2013-10-19 20:53:39	@Espyo	*already there
2013-10-19 20:53:44	@Espyo	I had a lot of trouble with that, but it's good to go now

2013-10-19 20:57:43	@Espyo	it's... somewhere
2013-10-19 20:57:47	@Espyo	on Documents/, I think
2013-10-19 20:57:54	@Espyo	a chat hug works
2013-10-19 20:58:00	@J	oh
2013-10-19 20:58:06	@Espyo	Los_Plagas: you asked for screenshots, right?
2013-10-19 20:58:09	@J	that...seems kind of wrong, but okay
2013-10-19 20:58:17	@Espyo	there's one I posted recently on the forum post
2013-10-19 20:58:23	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2013-10-19 20:58:26	@Espyo	slightly outdated, but it showcases basically what's working
2013-10-19 20:58:28	@J	except to use it you'd have to move it up one directory
2013-10-19 20:58:30	@Espyo	J: it's just temporary
2013-10-19 20:58:40	@Espyo	so, to use it, you just want it on the root?
2013-10-19 20:58:41	Los_Plagas	SHOW ME!
2013-10-19 20:58:42	@Espyo	hm, ok then
2013-10-19 20:58:47	@Espyo	you haven't seen the forum post yet?

2013-10-19 20:59:06	Los_Plagas	I haven't looked at the Recent Changes yet.
2013-10-19 20:59:13	@Espyo	check the October update for the most updated screenshot I have
2013-10-19 20:59:16	Los_Plagas	Haven't edited for a while.
2013-10-19 20:59:20	Mariostar123	espyo
2013-10-19 20:59:22	ThePikminMeister	I just finished writing another dungeon for my game
2013-10-19 20:59:22	@Espyo	I'd make a video, but I've come to the point where a /lot/ is already done
2013-10-19 20:59:28	@Espyo	Mariostar123: yes?
2013-10-19 20:59:30	Mariostar123	you know your op now
2013-10-19 20:59:35	@Espyo	yes
2013-10-19 20:59:39	@Espyo	it was because of the Testyo incident
2013-10-19 20:59:42	@Espyo	should things come out of hand
2013-10-19 20:59:46	@Espyo	as you see, I'm not all powerful now
2013-10-19 20:59:49	Mariostar123	you should of been a long time ago
2013-10-19 20:59:49	@Espyo	it's just a precaution
2013-10-19 20:59:51	Los_Plagas	I want to edit but I feel too lazy, and there's so much surrounding me, but I don't have Pikmin 3 or anything, so I can't contribute much new stuff.
2013-10-19 20:59:54	@Espyo	that's all being an op is
2013-10-19 21:00:00	@Espyo	right
2013-10-19 21:00:09	@Espyo	well, we have a ToDo lying around, with tasks that need to be made
2013-10-19 21:00:11	Mariostar123	what are we doing?
2013-10-19 21:00:16	@Espyo	maybe one of them'll catch your attention
2013-10-19 21:00:27	@Espyo	what do you mean? what you're doing wrong?
2013-10-19 21:00:35	@Espyo	well, nothing currently, but Testyo being kicked for flooding is a bad sign
2013-10-19 21:00:47	@Espyo	just making sure it doesn't happen again, regardless of the path that needs to be taken
2013-10-19 21:00:50	Mariostar123	hay espyo,is the fangame done yet?
2013-10-19 21:00:53	Mariostar123	^engine

2013-10-19 21:02:41	ThePikminMeister	What can we do?
2013-10-19 21:02:56	Mariostar123	yeh
2013-10-19 21:02:59	Mariostar123	what can we do
2013-10-19 21:03:02	@Espyo	I need to handle animations, which will take a bit
2013-10-19 21:03:08	@Espyo	I need to handle states, which could take a LONG while
2013-10-19 21:03:09	ThePikminMeister	So what can we do?
2013-10-19 21:03:15	@Espyo	like a Bulborb: it has the eating state, the walking state, etc.
2013-10-19 21:03:20	Mariostar123	ok
2013-10-19 21:03:27	Mariostar123	shall I get a sprite sheet?
2013-10-19 21:03:33	@Espyo	need to actually do something with treasures, need to do music, menus...
2013-10-19 21:03:34	Mariostar123	or something more advamnce
2013-10-19 21:03:45	ThePikminMeister	Espyo what can we do to help?
2013-10-19 21:03:48	@Espyo	well, I would like it if the graphics could follow the same style all throughout
2013-10-19 21:03:49	Mariostar123	yes
2013-10-19 21:03:54	Mariostar123	we are in with you pal
2013-10-19 21:03:57	@Espyo	and sprite sheets aren't normally seen directly from above
2013-10-19 21:04:03	@Espyo	so it looks bad most of the time
2013-10-19 21:04:04	Mariostar123	your the 1st guy I met here
2013-10-19 21:04:04	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2013-10-19 21:04:10	@Espyo	let's see...
2013-10-19 21:04:14	Mariostar123	and you made me feel at home
2013-10-19 21:04:18	@Espyo	unless any of you can program in C++, there's not much that can be done to help
2013-10-19 21:04:23	Mariostar123	so let me help
2013-10-19 21:04:33	Mariostar123	also J helped me settle in to
2013-10-19 21:04:49	@Espyo	though I need help on the graphics department, the sprites follow a layout that'd be hard to do
2013-10-19 21:04:55	@Espyo	as for sounds and music, I've got that covered
2013-10-19 21:05:08	@Espyo	I think the best thing you can do now is spread the word, and see if you can find someone with a lot of free time and art skills
2013-10-19 21:05:23	@Espyo	other than that, work and think hard about your games, and tell me about the sort of mechanics you'd like to see
2013-10-19 21:05:26	Mariostar123	o :(
2013-10-19 21:05:28	@Espyo	so I know what to make the engine ready for
2013-10-19 21:05:37	Mariostar123	well...ok :(
2013-10-19 21:05:48	ThePikminMeister	Make it ready for puffs tools
2013-10-19 21:06:06	ThePikminMeister	Puffstools
2013-10-19 21:06:19	ThePikminMeister	And puffshrooms
2013-10-19 21:06:40	@Espyo	I'll try
2013-10-19 21:06:47	@Espyo	one thing is making an enemy bite
2013-10-19 21:06:59	@Espyo	making an enemy release spores that turns a Pikmin into an entirely new being is more complicated
2013-10-19 21:07:04	ThePikminMeister	Oh
2013-10-19 21:07:16	ThePikminMeister	Well you can at least make puffshrooms
2013-10-19 21:07:38	ThePikminMeister	They are the things in my game that you have to collect
2013-10-19 21:07:53	Mariostar123	:(

2013-10-19 21:13:16	@J	testing is always useful
2013-10-19 21:13:58	Mariostar123	yes it is
2013-10-19 21:13:58	@J	[20:58:40] @Espyo so, to use it, you just want it on the root?

2013-10-19 21:14:18	Mariostar123	what?
2013-10-19 21:14:20	@J	yeah, because that's where the executable needs to go to know where the resources are
2013-10-19 21:14:40	@J	or...oh, maybe it works on cwd?
2013-10-19 21:14:55	@Espyo	well, of course, testing will also help
2013-10-19 21:15:01	ThePikminMeister	It will
2013-10-19 21:15:03	@Espyo	but right now there's really not much to test
2013-10-19 21:15:05	@J	in which case it _could_ go in Source/, but you'd need to edit the makefile a little, and run it like 'Source/thingy'
2013-10-19 21:15:08	Mariostar123	shall I spread the word?
2013-10-19 21:15:12	@J	testing it works?
2013-10-19 21:15:20	ThePikminMeister	I wanna be a tester if I will be able to
2013-10-19 21:15:24	@J	there's always stuff to test

2013-10-19 21:15:39	@Espyo	I posted on the forum topic that "testing" isn't much of a thing
2013-10-19 21:15:49	@Espyo	the engine is right there, available to pick up at any time

2013-10-19 21:17:28	@Espyo	you guys want to test it now?
2013-10-19 21:17:35	ThePikminMeister	Yes
2013-10-19 21:17:50	@J	well, I guess a few bugs, and a few improvement suggestions
2013-10-19 21:17:54	supermarioglitchy4	what there is of it
2013-10-19 21:18:04	@Espyo	ok then

2013-10-19 21:18:12	@Espyo	of course

2013-10-19 21:18:17	ThePikminMeister	Plz
2013-10-19 21:18:19	@Espyo	oh, up front, let me just tell you guys something
2013-10-19 21:18:22	@J	you should totally try to set up auto-builds, just because that would be a fun thing to do
2013-10-19 21:18:22	@Espyo	there is ONE glitch I'm aware of
2013-10-19 21:18:29	@Espyo	and... you're better off not performing it
2013-10-19 21:18:29	Mariostar123	ok
2013-10-19 21:18:33	@Espyo	because it freezes
2013-10-19 21:18:39	Mariostar123	gottchya
2013-10-19 21:18:40	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2013-10-19 21:18:44	@J	freezes the everything?
2013-10-19 21:18:52	@Espyo	freezes the engine
2013-10-19 21:18:58	@Espyo	currently, if you issue more than 50 Pikmin to carry the "treasure", it freezes
2013-10-19 21:19:04	Mariostar123	I wish there was a friend list here
2013-10-19 21:19:05	Mariostar123	ok
2013-10-19 21:19:06	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2013-10-19 21:19:07	@Espyo	J, you should be able to figure out why if you think about it a bit
2013-10-19 21:19:13	Mariostar123	il use 35 to be safe
2013-10-19 21:19:23	Mariostar123	overload?
2013-10-19 21:19:30	Mariostar123	not set the counter to 50
2013-10-19 21:19:33	@Espyo	auto-builds are... uh, they kinda exist
2013-10-19 21:19:38	Mariostar123	ok
2013-10-19 21:19:39	@Espyo	no, the counter can even go above 100, I think
2013-10-19 21:19:45	Mariostar123	ok
2013-10-19 21:19:53	@Espyo	the freeze happens because the treasure is set to have 30 Pikmin minimum to carry
2013-10-19 21:19:55	@Espyo	but 50 maximum
2013-10-19 21:19:57	ThePikminMeister	Wait Espyo will you be able to customize the thing that you have to collect?
2013-10-19 21:20:06	@Espyo	and when 50 Pikmin are carrying the treasure, all spots are taken
2013-10-19 21:20:06	Mariostar123	is it 21:20 were you are espyo?
2013-10-19 21:20:12	Mariostar123	ok
2013-10-19 21:20:14	@Espyo	when you issue one more Pikmin, the game can't find a spot, and freezes
2013-10-19 21:20:18	Mariostar123	il use 35 as the limit
2013-10-19 21:20:18	@Espyo	Mariostar123: it's 21:20, yes
2013-10-19 21:20:22	Mariostar123	ok

2013-10-19 21:26:31	Testyo	Help file: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47921869/Permanent/Testyo/Help.html Ask Espyo for more info!
2013-10-19 21:26:39	@J	I don't quite get which putting >50 on it would end up in a loop, though
2013-10-19 21:26:39	@Espyo	hmm, yes
2013-10-19 21:26:43	@Espyo	J: you can't put them back
2013-10-19 21:27:01	@Espyo	because when a Pikmin searches for a spot, it picks randomly between the ones available
2013-10-19 21:27:04	@J	aren't you just doing a random choice of 50 things and whatever does that should break?
2013-10-19 21:27:06	ThePikminMeister	can you break walls?
2013-10-19 21:27:08	@Espyo	and doesn't check if there are any

2013-10-19 21:27:53	@Espyo	everything is currently just a testing area
2013-10-19 21:28:00	@Espyo	made specifically to test the things I've made thus far

2013-10-20 18:48:18	Los_Plagas	Sometimes I dream of snowboarding through a valley of dead people,their frozen bodies, mouths agape, propelling me toward the everlasting fog.
2013-10-20 18:48:34	Los_Plagas	And done.
2013-10-20 18:48:42	Espyo	if I knew that you'd go around resaying stuff related to ice cream time, as if it were some sort of epic meme, I wouldn't have ever done it in the first place
2013-10-20 18:48:54	Los_Plagas	Marioguy123 is probably intimidated enough already.

2013-10-20 18:49:49	Espyo	hi
2013-10-20 18:49:57	Marioguy123	im at bit busy so brb
2013-10-20 18:51:55	Los_Plagas	So, the screenshots of your engine made it seem like it was pretty well done, Espyo.
2013-10-20 18:52:09	Los_Plagas	Are you planning to make it downloadable or something?
2013-10-20 18:52:18	Espyo	of course
2013-10-20 18:52:25	Espyo	you haven't tried the current alpha yet?
2013-10-20 18:52:31	Espyo	I made it available yesterday
2013-10-20 18:52:38	Espyo	hm, that reminds me, need to update the forum post
2013-10-20 18:53:03	Los_Plagas	Wait... It's done?!
2013-10-20 18:53:53	Espyo	current alpha
2013-10-20 18:53:58	Espyo	the full thing is far from being complete
2013-10-20 18:54:37	Los_Plagas	It would've been so cool to see it 3D...
2013-10-20 18:54:43	Los_Plagas	But of course that costs $$$
2013-10-20 18:54:50	Los_Plagas	And a lot more time and experience. 
2013-10-20 18:55:01	Espyo	of course
2013-10-20 18:55:08	Espyo	and what matters is the actual game
2013-10-20 18:55:10	Espyo	not fanciness
2013-10-20 18:55:14	Los_Plagas	I wish Nintendo workers patrolled this chat room...
2013-10-20 18:55:19	Espyo	besides, by the time I'm done with this, it'll look pretty good, I hope
2013-10-20 18:55:22	Espyo	I wouldn't
2013-10-20 18:55:28	Espyo	they'd make me cease and desist in just about 2 seconds
2013-10-20 18:55:42	Los_Plagas	Oh yes.
2013-10-20 18:55:45	Los_Plagas	Copyright.
2013-10-20 18:56:35	Los_Plagas	Well, they conveniently only notice the parts that make this seem like a /suggestion/, not a "finished" project.
2013-10-20 18:57:03	Espyo	doesn't matter, they could make me stop even THINKING about making it
2013-10-20 18:57:34	Los_Plagas	No, like a suggestion TO THEM, not to some random, non-Nintendo-affiliated guy.
2013-10-20 18:57:54	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-20 18:57:57	Espyo	they still wouldn't do it
2013-10-20 18:58:02	Espyo	they don't like the idea of fans making stuff
2013-10-20 18:58:03	Espyo	only playing
2013-10-20 18:58:53	Los_Plagas	A lot more games are allowing modding...
2013-10-20 18:58:58	Los_Plagas	But that's mostly computers.
2013-10-20 18:59:07	Espyo	exactly
2013-10-20 18:59:09	Espyo	not so much on consoles
2013-10-20 18:59:11	Los_Plagas	It would be slightly hard to do that sort of stuff with a controller. 
2013-10-20 18:59:17	Espyo	unless it's a game that's ONLY about that
2013-10-20 18:59:25	Espyo	like WarioWare DIY or Little Big Planet
2013-10-20 18:59:30	Espyo	and even then, those only allow limited things
2013-10-20 18:59:57	Los_Plagas	In comes a Pikmin computer game.
2013-10-20 19:00:01	Los_Plagas	Which, of course, is you.
2013-10-20 19:00:19	Los_Plagas	A person without endless time and resources.

2013-10-21 20:39:01	@J	...yeah, /cl != /a
2013-10-21 20:39:31	@J	you could just make them redirects instead
2013-10-21 20:39:37	@J	but meh, I'll do it at some point
2013-10-21 20:39:43	@J	no rush
2013-10-21 20:45:44	Espyo	but they aren't linked by anything
2013-10-21 20:45:55	Espyo	and we have redirs that link to redirs, that link to the wrong glitches
2013-10-21 20:46:04	Espyo	and stuff like "bridge glitches" no longer makes sense
2013-10-21 20:46:08	Espyo	and more reasons
2013-10-21 20:46:26	Espyo	and I removed almost all links to the articles I marked as deletion
2013-10-21 20:46:32	Espyo	I think Counter glitch is the exception
2013-10-21 20:46:42	Espyo	because it's mentioned in so many places, it's better to keep it as a redir
2013-10-21 20:46:54	Espyo	also there's stuff like "The Wollywog Glitch"
2013-10-21 20:47:08	Espyo	and some pages with titles that end in periods
2013-10-21 21:06:14	@J	did you fix the thing?
2013-10-21 21:06:23	@J	I forget what the thing was, but the question still stands
2013-10-21 21:06:25	Espyo	what thing
2013-10-21 21:06:31	Espyo	oh, zoom out fade out thing
2013-10-21 21:06:38	Espyo	I raised an issue on GitHub
2013-10-21 21:06:44	Espyo	and currently, that's the best I can do
2013-10-21 21:07:26	@J	you could make a VM to test things
2013-10-21 21:07:46	Espyo	but it's so slow
2013-10-21 21:07:54	Espyo	and I think last time I tried, it didn't do well with Allegro
2013-10-21 21:08:06	Espyo	either way, I'm currently working on the glitch articles
2013-10-21 21:08:11	Espyo	have you deleted the ones I marked?
2013-10-21 21:08:11	@J	you probably used Ubuntu then
2013-10-21 21:08:16	Espyo	well I did, but
2013-10-21 21:08:33	@J	no, I haven't deleted them
2013-10-21 21:08:35	@J	[20:39:37] @J but meh, I'll do it at some point
2013-10-21 21:08:55	Espyo	but having them is messing up my searches
2013-10-21 21:09:01	Espyo	by which I mean it's overwhelming
2013-10-21 21:09:05	Espyo	it'd be easier to give me the power
2013-10-21 21:09:09	Espyo	I think it's a bit due, either way
2013-10-21 21:09:21	@J	...
2013-10-21 21:09:25	@J	I thought you rejected it before?
2013-10-21 21:09:29	Espyo	is "due" the word I want?
2013-10-21 21:09:36	@J	maybe
2013-10-21 21:09:40	Espyo	did I?
2013-10-21 21:09:45	Espyo	maybe I just said I didn't need it
2013-10-21 21:09:49	Espyo	well, I guess I need it now
2013-10-21 21:10:44	@J	well, I have no problem doing it - it's more whether anyone else would mind it just happening without a vote or anything
2013-10-21 21:12:01	Espyo	right
2013-10-21 21:12:06	Espyo	well, it's just deletion of pages
2013-10-21 21:12:24	Espyo	and unfortunately, there aren't many people to discuss on the issue
2013-10-21 21:12:30	Espyo	or, easier solution
2013-10-21 21:12:32	Espyo	you delete them
2013-10-21 21:13:22	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Talk:Blowhog_glitch should this exist?
2013-10-21 21:15:16	@J	okay, all done
2013-10-21 21:15:30	@J	doesn't really matter
2013-10-21 21:15:33	@J	no reason to delete it
2013-10-21 21:15:56	Espyo	no reason to keep it either
2013-10-21 21:15:58	Espyo	*shrug*
2013-10-21 21:16:08	Espyo	ah, much better
2013-10-21 21:16:44	@J	also, to make up for that, you have to remove all those images from 'category:pikmin [12]'
2013-10-21 21:17:19	Espyo	but that wasn't a favor
2013-10-21 21:17:31	Espyo	it was your civil duty as a bureaucrat
2013-10-21 21:17:56	Espyo	but either way, guess I will
2013-10-21 21:17:59	@J	it was a favour to do it right now
2013-10-21 21:18:37	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Talk:Bulbmin-Candypop_glitch
2013-10-21 21:18:40	Espyo	...I suppose
2013-10-21 21:18:47	Espyo	also that one should probably be deleted
2013-10-21 21:28:48	--	BetaM\LunarM64 is now known as BetaMaster64
2013-10-21 21:36:17	Espyo	heh, there was a neat glitch hidden in the depths of the wiki
2013-10-21 21:36:27	Espyo	this search is finally paying off
2013-10-21 21:36:33	Espyo	I'm adding it to the P2 glitches article
2013-10-21 21:36:35	Espyo	but I need a good name
2013-10-21 21:36:41	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Challenge_Mode_%28Pikmin_2%29#Minor_glitch
2013-10-21 21:37:26	Espyo	basically, if a captain is hurt just as the fade out of "Give up" happens, it'll be lying on the ground throughout the Ship Pod's sucking in animation

2013-10-21 22:01:46	@J	sad
2013-10-21 22:09:57	Espyo	so, that page?
2013-10-21 22:23:45	@J	what about it?
2013-10-21 22:24:48	Espyo	it's a copy of the main page?
2013-10-21 22:24:50	Espyo	why does it even exist?
2013-10-21 22:25:08	@J	some guy made a test
2013-10-21 22:25:13	@J	clearly
2013-10-21 22:26:20	Espyo	>There's a glitch in the Piklopedia for Dwarf Bulbears while eating Pikpik carrots, in which they die instantly. 
2013-10-21 22:26:21	Espyo	what
2013-10-21 22:27:29	Espyo	I can't see anything
2013-10-21 22:27:32	Espyo	been trying for a minute
2013-10-21 22:27:38	Espyo	just spamming carrots like mad
2013-10-21 22:28:02	Espyo	they can't chew themselves either
2013-10-21 22:28:29	Espyo	luring them to the water also does nothing
2013-10-21 22:28:53	@J	fun times
2013-10-21 22:29:09	@J	oh, right, my dream last night
2013-10-21 22:29:11	@J	it's a good one
2013-10-21 22:29:16	Espyo	does it explain this glitch
2013-10-21 22:29:21	@J	probably
2013-10-21 22:29:44	@J	so it was very sunny, and I was on a street, walking along
2013-10-21 22:29:58	@J	and every now and then, a kid fell out of a tree
2013-10-21 22:30:05	@J	and just died instantly on hitting the floor
2013-10-21 22:30:21	Espyo	pfft
2013-10-21 22:30:48	@J	I thought it was pretty normal, because they were copying some currently-popular super hero
2013-10-21 22:30:52	@J	and I just continued walking
2013-10-21 22:31:28	@J	then I met a(n IRL) friend, who was kneeling on a skateboard (or something similar), and using his hands to push himself forwards along the ground
2013-10-21 22:31:39	@J	he was grumpy because he couldn't fly like the kids
2013-10-21 22:31:43	@J	and the super hero
2013-10-21 22:31:44	@J	and me
2013-10-21 22:31:50	Espyo	seems normal enough
2013-10-21 22:31:51	@J	so I started flying, which was really fun
2013-10-21 22:32:19	Espyo	you know, I have yet to have a flying dream
2013-10-21 22:32:23	@J	then I noticed my friend had an ice lolly, and it was huge, with 3 sticks and just a huge chunk of ice stuff
2013-10-21 22:32:59	@J	I made some comment about wanting one, then checked my pocket for change and flew off where he'd come from to an ice cream van I knew was around the corner
2013-10-21 22:33:39	@J	as I passed under the leaves of trees by the side of the road, I noticed that there were actually ice lollies growing on them
2013-10-21 22:33:48	@J	I passed one with red ones
2013-10-21 22:34:08	@J	then I was just reaching out for an orange one on the next tree, when I woke up
2013-10-21 22:34:33	Espyo	man
2013-10-21 22:34:40	@J	since then, I've realised there's a weird sort of theatric continuity there - you often get saves right before something bad happens,
2013-10-21 22:34:49	@J	and the kids were falling out of the /trees/
2013-10-21 22:34:49	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-21 22:34:51	@J	think about it
2013-10-21 22:35:30	Espyo	"you often get saves right before something bad happens"?
2013-10-21 22:35:43	@J	as in, the character gets saved by some random event
2013-10-21 22:36:00	@J	even if they didn't realise what was about to happen
2013-10-21 22:36:43	@J	anyway, I don't remember many other flying dreams, but it was really fun
2013-10-21 22:37:28	Espyo	ah
2013-10-21 22:37:37	@J	it was kind of like swimming, but much faster and without as much physical movement
2013-10-21 22:38:20	Espyo	right

2013-10-23 00:33:22	@PikFan	okay so
2013-10-23 00:33:29	Espyo	hey
2013-10-23 00:33:36	@PikFan	I am probably the craziest Pikmin fan ever
2013-10-23 00:33:56	@PikFan	because I've started an attempt to get 1,000 Pikmin in a day
2013-10-23 00:34:06	Espyo	wow
2013-10-23 00:34:07	Espyo	any luck?
2013-10-23 00:34:16	@PikFan	yes, actually
2013-10-23 00:34:35	@PikFan	I've gotten 400+ Pikmin and it's not even midday yet
2013-10-23 00:34:54	@PikFan	it's only like... 1/3 into the day
2013-10-23 00:35:36	@PikFan	and I also have 1,640 ultra spicy sprays
2013-10-23 00:35:55	@PikFan	and I have 557 hours of play time
2013-10-23 00:36:25	@PikFan	would anyone care to remind me how obsessed I am?
2013-10-23 00:37:43	Espyo	nice
2013-10-23 00:37:45	Espyo	heh

2013-10-23 00:41:37	@PikFan	even the title has an error

2013-10-23 00:44:43	@PikFan	fixing it now
2013-10-23 00:47:40	@PikFan	done
2013-10-23 00:47:44	@PikFan	been done
2013-10-23 00:48:22	@PikFan	gaaaaaaah
2013-10-23 00:48:29	@PikFan	I can't patrol the original page
2013-10-23 00:48:52	@PikFan	...er, no, I can
2013-10-23 00:49:09	@PikFan	why did I not see the patrol button?
2013-10-23 00:49:45	Espyo	heh
2013-10-23 00:51:01	@PikFan	and can someone license this? http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Swarming_sheargrub.jpg
2013-10-23 00:53:27	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-23 00:53:29	Espyo	should be a screenie
2013-10-23 01:32:49	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Permanent/PFE/PFE%20alpha.zip
2013-10-23 01:32:59	Espyo	eh, wrong channel, but still works
2013-10-23 01:33:03	Espyo	there are two ways to move the group
2013-10-23 01:33:17	Espyo	there's the C-stick way, in which the group moves the direction the right analog stick is held
2013-10-23 01:33:26	Espyo	you can only use this with a controller, and it's kinda glitchy
2013-10-23 01:33:31	Espyo	this isn't the method I want you to use
2013-10-23 01:33:40	Espyo	instead, I want you to point at where you want the group to go, and press Space
2013-10-23 01:33:44	Espyo	(hold Space)
2013-10-23 01:33:52	Espyo	they'll move to the cursor, like in NPC!
2013-10-23 01:34:03	Espyo	I want you to tell me if those arrows feel similar to NPC!, if they feel better, worse, etc.
2013-10-23 01:34:06	Espyo	just tell me what you think
2013-10-23 01:36:38	@PikFan	can't play it at the moment
2013-10-23 01:36:47	@PikFan	and I'm no good at zip files
2013-10-23 01:37:06	Espyo	if you're using windows xp or above (which you are), you just right-click the zip file and choose extract
2013-10-23 01:37:10	Espyo	then just press next next next
2013-10-23 01:37:17	Espyo	and it should create a folder with what was inside the zip
2013-10-23 01:37:19	Espyo	and that's all
2013-10-23 01:38:08	@PikFan	I can't
2013-10-23 01:38:14	@PikFan	I can't right click it
2013-10-23 01:38:19	@PikFan	well I can, but
2013-10-23 01:38:24	@PikFan	it opened in a window
2013-10-23 01:38:56	Espyo	are you using chrome?
2013-10-23 01:39:01	@PikFan	Firefox
2013-10-23 01:39:07	@PikFan	on my mom's laptop
2013-10-23 01:39:13	Espyo	well, you right click it when you actually download it

2013-10-23 22:19:50	@J	the 'show' link is very hard to see
2013-10-23 22:20:34	Espyo	it is
2013-10-23 22:20:39	Espyo	but it's not ultra important
2013-10-23 22:20:45	Espyo	after a while I stopped taking notice of it
2013-10-23 22:21:08	@J	considering that's the only way to show the stuff the template exists for, it kind of is
2013-10-23 22:21:33	Espyo	err
2013-10-23 22:21:36	Espyo	it didn't use to
2013-10-23 22:21:43	Espyo	well, suggestions on how to fix that?
2013-10-23 22:21:58	Espyo	can't we color the link?
2013-10-23 22:22:07	@J	but yeah, the thing looks okay
2013-10-23 22:22:12	@J	are the images ripped from the game?
2013-10-23 22:22:16	Espyo	yep
2013-10-23 22:22:20	Espyo	colored though
2013-10-23 22:22:23	Espyo	they come in black and white
2013-10-23 22:27:05	@J	maybe we could have an alternative colour for that link
2013-10-23 22:27:17	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-23 22:27:19	@J	I can't think of a good way to allow defining any colour in the template
2013-10-23 22:27:34	Espyo	different class of wikitable collapsible?
2013-10-23 22:28:39	@J	yes
2013-10-23 22:41:33	@J	http://i.imgur.com/N7ZUh9W.png
2013-10-23 22:41:51	@J	probably not the best colour, but I want one that will work everywhere the default won't
2013-10-23 22:48:43	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-23 22:48:46	Espyo	no, white works ok
2013-10-23 22:48:50	Espyo	maybe not pure white, though?
2013-10-23 22:52:52	@J	you mean grey?
2013-10-23 22:53:06	@J	I'm not sure I want to pick a hue in case of clashes
2013-10-23 22:53:12	@J	but I guess a light yellow would work anywhere
2013-10-23 22:53:22	Espyo	#E0E0E0 is still white, but not pure
2013-10-23 22:53:32	@J	ie. grey
2013-10-23 22:53:38	Espyo	no no no
2013-10-23 22:53:47	Espyo	grey starts at #DFDFDF
2013-10-23 22:53:50	Espyo	and below
2013-10-23 22:54:10	@J	...if you say so
2013-10-23 22:54:16	@J	anyway, I prefer #ffc
2013-10-23 23:08:51	Espyo	it's easy to see Steam as a platform in which only the best can ever hope to make games on
2013-10-23 23:09:18	Espyo	if you're just a student with a petty game idea, you better take it to some competition, because other than that, you're not getting your game played anywhere
2013-10-23 23:09:22	Espyo	except it's really not the case
2013-10-23 23:09:31	Espyo	Super Hexagon must've been done in just a few weeks
2013-10-23 23:09:38	Espyo	and it wasn't made by a super professional team
2013-10-23 23:09:52	Espyo	I mean, the icon of the window, when in windowed mode, is the default OpenGL icon
2013-10-23 23:24:55	@J	Hexagon was made for a Ludum Dare
2013-10-23 23:25:30	@J	I remember playing that during the judging phase
2013-10-23 23:26:34	@J	but yeah, loads of games by one person are on Steam
2013-10-23 23:27:10	@J	yesterday I met the guy who made Gateways and Shuggy, and they're both on Steam
2013-10-23 23:27:39	Espyo	ah
2013-10-23 23:27:45	@J	he contracted out some bits, but he was the only designer and programmer
2013-10-23 23:27:55	Espyo	makes me feel positive about making a game that one day'll be in the wild
2013-10-23 23:27:55	@J	Gunpoint, as a recent exampl
2013-10-23 23:27:56	@J	e
2013-10-23 23:28:14	@J	again, one guy, contracting out the graphics and sound
2013-10-23 23:29:24	@J	so tomorrow's going to be interestign
2013-10-23 23:29:25	@J	ng
2013-10-23 23:30:02	@J	I have 8 pears, a whole cabbage, 4 parsnips, 5 rashers of bacon and a dinner-sized pot of dinner
2013-10-23 23:30:08	@J	and anything I don't eat will go to waste
2013-10-23 23:30:30	@J	mm, I suppose the bacon could be used up in the morning
2013-10-23 23:31:24	Espyo	soup
2013-10-23 23:31:28	@J	so, that template: it might be nice if the images linked to the pages too
2013-10-23 23:31:40	Espyo	...
2013-10-23 23:31:41	Espyo	they do
2013-10-23 23:31:50	@J	I don't mean interesting because I don't know what to make with it, but because there's a lot of food
2013-10-23 23:32:03	@J	and I should mention this doesn't include lunch, which I'll get free at work
2013-10-23 23:32:17	Espyo	ah
2013-10-23 23:33:25	@J	did I ever mention the free lunches?
2013-10-23 23:33:30	@J	and unlimited free drinks?
2013-10-23 23:34:24	Espyo	not unlimited
2013-10-23 23:34:54	@J	apparently there used to be free ice cream from an ice cream van too, but that stopped before I started
2013-10-23 23:37:19	Espyo	oh, I missed this part: "which I'll get free at work"
2013-10-23 23:38:19	@J	you thought I found a different source of free food and didn't enquire further?
2013-10-23 23:38:33	Espyo	yes
2013-10-23 23:41:03	@J	silly
2013-10-23 23:44:17	@J	anyway, time to goy

2013-10-24 20:14:38	@J	maybe that was just putting the images in Treasure Hoard
2013-10-24 20:14:42	@J	also, why would you use batch
2013-10-24 20:17:54	Espyo	the file structure is .../tmp/<enemy name>/texture.bti
2013-10-24 20:18:02	Espyo	I used batch to remove the files from those folders and put them all in one folder
2013-10-24 20:18:11	Espyo	and then used batch to convert everything from .bti to .dds
2013-10-24 20:18:18	Espyo	and then I used xnView to convert everything into .png
2013-10-24 20:18:52	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Treasure_Hoard
2013-10-24 20:19:00	Espyo	hmm, maybe we should have icons for that too
2013-10-24 20:25:32	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-24 20:25:35	Espyo	Miles might now this
2013-10-24 20:25:41	Espyo	Miles, do Pikmin have actual HP?
2013-10-24 20:25:53	Espyo	I know that getting thrown away in battle leads to a deflowering, and debudding, but
2013-10-24 20:26:20	Espyo	yesterday I was messing around with Gatling Groinks, and I left them to shoot a Yellow Pikmin
2013-10-24 20:26:30	Espyo	they shot at it around 7 times before it actually died
2013-10-24 20:26:47	Espyo	either a Pikmin's death from a fatal blow is decided at random, or Pikmin actually have HP
2013-10-24 20:26:47	Miles	I don't think they do
2013-10-24 20:26:54	Espyo	maybe you know something about it, from messing with Dolphin
2013-10-24 20:27:07	Miles	Gatling Groinks are known to be weird
2013-10-24 20:27:23	Espyo	yeah, I was going to say, I don't remember them being so weird last time I played
2013-10-24 20:27:34	Espyo	well, I'll leave it in the open, on the article
2013-10-24 20:27:36	Espyo	thanks
2013-10-24 20:33:34	@J	I thought Gatling Groink attacks just have a chance to leave a Pikmin alive
2013-10-24 20:34:06	Espyo	must be a high change then, because I could swear that Pikmin ate over 6 shots
2013-10-24 20:34:11	@J	and while those are kind of where you would use batch, it's pretty horrible so you should learn shell instead
2013-10-24 20:34:28	Espyo	but I do know shell
2013-10-24 20:34:29	Espyo	...kinda
2013-10-24 20:34:38	Espyo	I mostly forgot it all, but I did learn in college
2013-10-24 20:34:49	@J	*'should use', then
2013-10-24 20:34:58	Espyo	also using shell via the Git Bash window is kinda... ech
2013-10-24 20:35:11	@J	why's that?
2013-10-24 20:35:21	Espyo	well, it's not glamorous, is all
2013-10-24 20:35:27	@J	also you can obviously write it in a file
2013-10-24 20:35:35	Espyo	oh, that reminds me, I wanted to get around to installing Linux on a VM
2013-10-24 20:35:39	Espyo	mostly for that weird glitch
2013-10-24 20:35:45	Espyo	so what distro would you recommend?
2013-10-24 20:35:55	Espyo	yeah, I can, but debugging it, going back and forth...
2013-10-24 20:36:16	Espyo	also Git Bash doesn't really care about Ctrl+arrow keys and Home/End
2013-10-24 20:36:25	@J	mm...
2013-10-24 20:36:35	@J	yeah, there are different shortcuts
2013-10-24 20:36:38	@J	alt+b/f
2013-10-24 20:36:42	Espyo	...
2013-10-24 20:36:46	@J	home/end should work, though
2013-10-24 20:37:03	@J	alt-left/right work in real Bash, but not on Windows for some reason
2013-10-24 20:37:03	Espyo	ah, Home/End do
2013-10-24 20:37:08	Espyo	I must be thinking of another one
2013-10-24 20:37:19	@J	perhaps ctrl-backspace
2013-10-24 20:37:32	@J	for that, use ctrl-w or alt-backspace (which do slightly different things)
2013-10-24 20:37:32	Espyo	ctrl+backspace works
2013-10-24 20:37:35	Espyo	so does alt+f/b
2013-10-24 20:37:36	@J	really?
2013-10-24 20:37:50	Espyo	but come on... alt+f/b is horrible
2013-10-24 20:38:02	@J	alt-backspace is probably nicer, though - it doesn't go past punctuation
2013-10-24 20:38:07	Espyo	hm
2013-10-24 20:38:17	@J	yeah, really not sure why alt-left/right doesn't work
2013-10-24 20:38:25	Espyo	hmmmm, on Firefox (at least), alt+backspace deletes the whole line
2013-10-24 20:38:29	@J	you should be able to use most of these: http://www.math.uh.edu/~bgb/emacs_keys.html
2013-10-24 20:39:48	@J	well, the cursor movement ones, anyway
2013-10-24 20:40:09	@J	and deletion
2013-10-24 20:40:40	Espyo	well, anyway
2013-10-24 20:40:41	Espyo	recommended distro?
2013-10-24 20:41:48	@J	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4094828/msysgit-bash-how-to-enable-ctrlleft-right-arrows
2013-10-24 20:42:07	@J	okay, yeah
2013-10-24 20:42:14	Espyo	ooh, neat
2013-10-24 20:42:37	@J	I want to say Mint, but check if the DE requires hardware acceleration
2013-10-24 20:42:42	@J	if it does, it will be slow like Ubunt
2013-10-24 20:42:43	@J	u
2013-10-24 20:42:57	@J	well, you have a choice
2013-10-24 20:43:00	@J	maybe Mint Xfce
2013-10-24 20:44:28	@J	Fedora uses Gnome Shell, Ubuntu uses Unity, both requiring acceleration
2013-10-24 20:44:35	@J	Debian is just too old, probably won't have Allegro 5
2013-10-24 20:44:59	@J	perhaps Lubuntu, if that's still around
2013-10-24 20:45:01	Espyo	well, that stackoverflow solution didn't work
2013-10-24 20:45:03	@J	or Xubuntu
2013-10-24 20:45:07	@J	sad
2013-10-24 20:45:09	Espyo	I did find the file, I think
2013-10-24 20:45:10	Espyo	but no good
2013-10-24 20:45:14	Espyo	oh well
2013-10-24 20:45:24	Espyo	I think I should probably have... what's it called
2013-10-24 20:45:29	Espyo	the MinGW bash here
2013-10-24 20:45:35	Espyo	or is it the Cygwin bash?
2013-10-24 20:45:45	Espyo	*shrug*
2013-10-24 20:45:48	Espyo	it's just an inconvenience
2013-10-24 20:45:49	@J	you installed it with Git, so it should be the thing in the question
2013-10-24 20:46:20	Espyo	really looks like it's a dedicated bash command line
2013-10-24 20:47:30	Espyo	oh hey, I think I used Lubuntu before
2013-10-24 20:47:40	Espyo	I remember there was one class in college that required us to install a weird Linux OS
2013-10-24 20:47:48	Espyo	it was very light, but also came with a lot of things
2013-10-24 20:47:59	Espyo	it had a blueish-silver theme, much likes Lubuntu seems to have
2013-10-24 20:48:57	Espyo	hm, off the top of your head, what enemies can you think of that change based on how much HP they have?
2013-10-24 20:49:05	Espyo	I know Hairy Bulborbs lose their hair once they reach half
2013-10-24 20:49:07	@J	in Pikmin?
2013-10-24 20:49:11	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Piklopedia (convenient list)
2013-10-24 20:49:12	Espyo	P1 and P2
2013-10-24 20:49:24	@J	I haven't fought it in ages, but does Pikmin 1 Emperor Bulblax?
2013-10-24 20:49:26	@J	Waterwraith
2013-10-24 20:49:39	Espyo	really can't remember
2013-10-24 20:49:44	Espyo	hopefully we have it on the wiki
2013-10-24 20:49:47	Espyo	right, Waterwraith
2013-10-24 20:49:54	@J	...Volatile Dweevil
2013-10-24 20:50:00	@J	Titan Dweevil
2013-10-24 20:50:22	Espyo	heh
2013-10-24 20:50:37	@J	I guess you could say the flint beetles
2013-10-24 20:50:44	@J	in that they drop different things
2013-10-24 20:51:08	@J	Shearwig flies away
2013-10-24 20:51:27	@J	does the Ravenous Whiskerpillar run away or am I making that up?
2013-10-24 20:51:40	Espyo	ah, the Ravenous Whiskerpillar never dies
2013-10-24 20:51:59	@J	Anode Beetle...not really, but you can flip it and killing its friends makes it harmless
2013-10-24 20:52:50	@J	Raging Long Legs
2013-10-24 20:53:03	@J	most of these are just behavioural changes
2013-10-24 20:54:18	@J	yeah, probably don't count BLL/RLL
2013-10-24 20:54:41	@J	or ACB; they're just varying movement patterns
2013-10-24 20:54:44	@J	that's probably it
2013-10-24 20:56:10	Espyo	yeah, BLL/RLL are just from being hit, not so much for using health differently
2013-10-24 20:56:19	Espyo	almost all enemies shake Pikmin off when they're hit for a bit
2013-10-24 20:57:15	Espyo	ACB? Armored Cannon Beetle?
2013-10-24 20:57:35	@J	yeah
2013-10-24 20:57:42	Espyo	I'm not seeing it
2013-10-24 20:57:48	Espyo	it just shoots rocks and opens up when clogged
2013-10-24 20:58:01	@J	yeah, opens up, but again, not really a health thing
2013-10-24 20:58:08	@J	that's why I said ignore it like RLL/BLL
2013-10-24 20:58:16	Espyo	right
2013-10-24 20:58:44	@J	I guess that only leaves 4 enemies
2013-10-24 20:58:54	@J	Hairy Bulborb, Waterwraith, Titan Dweevil, Shearwig
2013-10-24 21:00:22	Espyo	I noted that Flint Beetles don't really have HP, but the drops vary with how "hurt" they are
2013-10-24 21:00:33	Espyo	also noted how Whiskerpillars don't really die
2013-10-24 21:03:01	Espyo	>After taking half of his overall health, this phase will end, and the Bulblax will use his long-range jump attack, but still retains the ability to do both former moves in the same way mentioned before.
2013-10-24 21:03:05	Espyo	for the Emperor Bulblax
2013-10-24 21:04:43	Espyo	>Pikmin can also be thrown into his mouth while he is preparing to stick out his tongue and still give a stun-like effect.
2013-10-24 21:04:44	Espyo	what
2013-10-24 21:11:58	Espyo	>It is replaced by a roaring phase when the Bulblax is about a quarter until death; it will also make other Bulblaxes join the fight. The roar scatters the Pikmin like Mitites, and drags existing Mitites out of the ground.
2013-10-24 21:12:12	Espyo	(Emperor Bulblax in P2)
2013-10-24 21:12:17	Espyo	ok, I'll read all boss articles
2013-10-24 21:15:59	Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2013-10-24 21:16:09	Espyo	just noticed the Fiery Bulblax icon on the Piklopedia is 80x80
2013-10-24 21:16:27	Espyo	all bosses are 80x80, all other enemies are 40x40
2013-10-24 21:21:32	Espyo	ok, am I missing something, or...?
2013-10-24 21:21:51	Espyo	shouldn't [[File:...|64px]] make the image appear 64 pixels wide?
2013-10-24 21:24:06	Espyo	...oh, it can't go over its normal size

2013-10-24 22:36:21	NotThePikminMeister	ok
2013-10-24 22:39:27	NotThePikminMeister	so far, something is customizable in the engine
2013-10-24 22:42:54	Espyo	kinda
2013-10-24 22:43:00	Espyo	you can customize the graphics and sounds
2013-10-24 22:43:00	NotThePikminMeister	the images
2013-10-24 22:43:03	NotThePikminMeister	yea
2013-10-24 22:44:44	@J	yeah, I saw that a few months ago

2013-10-24 22:57:40	@J	so you remember my game where you complained about the fade being really slow?
2013-10-24 22:57:55	@J	improvements since then:
2013-10-24 22:58:18	Espyo	I... would've recognized it better if you said Wearhouse from the getgo
2013-10-24 22:58:19	Espyo	but sure
2013-10-24 22:58:21	@J	first, in my game engine, draw FPS is now independent of update FPS, so the game can run at full speed but drop frames
2013-10-24 22:58:32	Espyo	great, that's a good idea
2013-10-24 22:59:06	@J	second, in the game, I made the fade update rate adaptive to current FPS, so if it's actually running slow, it updates the overlay colour less often
2013-10-24 22:59:17	@J	and beyond a certain point, it just doesn't fade at all
2013-10-24 22:59:27	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-24 22:59:34	Espyo	so basically delt at
2013-10-24 22:59:36	Espyo	*delta t
2013-10-24 22:59:45	@J	yeah
2013-10-24 22:59:58	@J	it's already supported in arbitrary interpolations
2013-10-24 23:00:08	@J	I just had to restart the fades partway through as necessary
2013-10-24 23:00:19	@J	and it just remembers the setting for the whole game
2013-10-24 23:00:26	@J	the worst setting, I should say
2013-10-24 23:00:53	@J	back to dropping frames, I made sure to set a minimum draw FPS (25, IIRC), beyond which it will still slow down
2013-10-24 23:01:05	@J	because no-one wants to see much fewer than half the frames
2013-10-24 23:01:35	Espyo	oh, come on, Lubuntu
2013-10-24 23:01:45	Espyo	first the kernel I picked was 64-bit and the VM's only 32-bit
2013-10-24 23:02:05	Espyo	now it claims my CPU doesn't have pae, which the kernel needs
2013-10-24 23:02:41	Espyo	don't really get the minimum draw FPS thing
2013-10-24 23:03:13	@J	I didn't think PAE was a hardware thing, just a software emulation-type thing
2013-10-24 23:03:47	@J	I just mean, if the update FPS is 60, I don't let the draw-to-update ratio fall below 25/60
2013-10-24 23:03:58	Espyo	oh
2013-10-24 23:04:33	@J	you could've just picked a non-PAE kernel
2013-10-24 23:04:42	@J	though I don't get why it's making you choose the kernel anyway
2013-10-24 23:04:58	Espyo	on the download page
2013-10-24 23:05:02	@J	PAE just lets you address more than 4GiB RAM on 32-bit, which you don't even have (and certainly not in the VM)
2013-10-24 23:05:04	Espyo	the only options were really 64-bit and 32-bit
2013-10-24 23:05:05	@J	oh
2013-10-24 23:05:08	@J	hmm
2013-10-24 23:05:09	Espyo	nothing about pae or anything, anywhere
2013-10-24 23:05:23	@J	well, it's not surprising that the 32-bit version is PAE
2013-10-24 23:05:35	@J	but I didn't think that had any hardware requirements
2013-10-24 23:05:43	Espyo	but I tried the 64-bit one before
2013-10-24 23:05:52	@J	VirtualBox?
2013-10-24 23:05:57	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-24 23:06:02	@J	(is your Windows even 64-bit?)
2013-10-24 23:06:17	Espyo	it is
2013-10-24 23:06:21	@J	try the CPU settings in VirtualBox
2013-10-24 23:06:25	@J	there might be a PAE setting
2013-10-24 23:06:31	@J	per-VM settings
2013-10-24 23:07:14	Espyo	going with xubuntu now
2013-10-24 23:07:16	@J	yeah, I see System/Processor tab/Enable PAE/NX
2013-10-24 23:07:26	@J	Xubuntu may well do the same thing
2013-10-24 23:08:15	Espyo	well, Lubuntu didn't complain this time
2013-10-24 23:08:16	@J	hah, I love how now, if I accidentally close WeeChat, nothing happens
2013-10-24 23:08:19	@J	I just lose connection
2013-10-24 23:08:52	Espyo	hm, pretty cool
2013-10-24 23:11:45	@J	but anyway, 64-bit virtualisation isn't really supported on older computers
2013-10-24 23:11:53	@J	even newer ones you often have to turn on a BIOS setting
2013-10-24 23:11:58	Espyo	I see
2013-10-24 23:12:01	Espyo	well, makes sense

2013-10-24 23:29:39	Espyo	I /really/ don't think I'll test anything successfully via VM
2013-10-24 23:37:47	@J	hmm
2013-10-24 23:39:24	@J	I would try it in this VM I have, but for some reason networking is broken
2013-10-24 23:41:27	Espyo	weird

2013-10-25 11:26:46	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-10-25 11:29:52	-->	Espyo (Mibbit@n12-481-16-90.cpe.netcabo.pt) has joined #pikipedia
2013-10-25 11:36:28	@J	so, yesterday I managed to get networking working in that VM
2013-10-25 11:36:42	@J	your game runs and I can reproduce the bug
2013-10-25 11:36:50	@J	not at full speed, but almost playable
2013-10-25 11:37:40	@J	I tried one of my games too, and it runs smoother
2013-10-25 11:37:55	@J	probably because yours is more GPU-dependent, which is being emulated by the CPU in this case
2013-10-25 11:56:41	Espyo	right
2013-10-25 11:56:54	Espyo	oh, that reminds me, I paused the Lubuntu installation yesterday
2013-10-25 11:56:55	Espyo	time to resume
2013-10-25 11:59:50	@J	if that is really too slow to do anything in, I can try sending you this VM (setting it up yourself would be...tricky)
2013-10-25 12:00:28	Espyo	heh, I believe you
2013-10-25 12:00:41	Espyo	eh, at least I only need to scroll the mouse wheel down
2013-10-25 12:00:44	Espyo	not actually play
2013-10-25 12:01:22	@J	yeah
2013-10-25 12:01:25	@J	well, we'll see
2013-10-25 12:01:36	@J	I need to go in an hour or so, then I won't be around for a few days
2013-10-25 12:02:31	Espyo	oh
2013-10-25 12:02:39	Espyo	any problem?
2013-10-25 12:03:44	@J	no, holiday
2013-10-25 12:04:00	@J	and staying at work late tonight, so I have the morning off
2013-10-25 12:04:40	Espyo	ah
2013-10-25 12:04:44	Espyo	fair enough
2013-10-25 12:36:14	Espyo	ok, how would I go on about getting Allegro now?
2013-10-25 12:42:14	@J	look for it in the repositories
2013-10-25 12:42:24	@J	it probably has Synaptic Package Manager
2013-10-25 12:43:59	Espyo	ah, of course
2013-10-25 12:44:05	Espyo	I just went to the software center right away
2013-10-25 12:45:29	Espyo	hm, there are quite a few
2013-10-25 12:45:36	Espyo	did you just download each addon individually?
2013-10-25 12:46:19	@J	I used Arch, so it's all in one package
2013-10-25 12:47:03	@J	there might be one that brings in all of them
2013-10-25 12:47:22	@J	either the main 'allegro5'-something one, or something like 'allegro5-plugins'
2013-10-25 12:48:00	Espyo	nope, all I see is the main library and all addons separately
2013-10-25 12:48:54	Espyo	ah, this comes with all addons
2013-10-25 12:50:15	@J	is it still being slow, or is it usable?
2013-10-25 12:50:25	Espyo	looks like it's behaving
2013-10-25 12:50:35	Espyo	disk access seems kinda slower than I remember a VM to be though
2013-10-25 12:53:00	@J	I tried to see how small I could make this VM I was using
2013-10-25 12:53:11	@J	I managed 446MiB
2013-10-25 12:54:07	@J	all set up with everything required to run your engine
2013-10-25 12:54:16	@J	even has a compiled executable for it
2013-10-25 12:54:25	Espyo	wo
2013-10-25 12:54:26	Espyo	*w
2013-10-25 12:57:46	@J	success yet?
2013-10-25 12:58:06	Espyo	looks like it installed Allegro with some degree of success
2013-10-25 12:58:21	Espyo	Synaptics Package Manager is frozen though
2013-10-25 12:58:27	Espyo	...or not
2013-10-25 12:58:33	Espyo	ok, next step...
2013-10-25 12:58:39	Espyo	I suppose I'd download my repo
2013-10-25 12:58:50	Espyo	any way to do that that's actually the correct way?
2013-10-25 12:58:59	@J	git clone <url>
2013-10-25 12:59:05	Espyo	wonderful
2013-10-25 12:59:06	@J	it's on the GitHub page
2013-10-25 13:00:54	Espyo	ah, naturally I need the git package
2013-10-25 13:00:59	Espyo	no worries, at least I can use apt-get
2013-10-25 13:03:07	@J	not installed by default?
2013-10-25 13:03:26	Espyo	nope
2013-10-25 13:03:41	Espyo	but done
2013-10-25 13:03:44	Espyo	ok... next step
2013-10-25 13:03:48	Espyo	probably something makefile something
2013-10-25 13:04:46	@J	just 'make'
2013-10-25 13:04:54	@J	hopefully make and GCC are installed
2013-10-25 13:05:16	Espyo	I think Synaptics installed them alongside
2013-10-25 13:05:42	Espyo	uh...
2013-10-25 13:05:46	Espyo	I thought I already fixed that
2013-10-25 13:05:52	Espyo	I accidentally set an integer to NULL
2013-10-25 13:05:56	Espyo	which is fine, because NULL is just 0, but
2013-10-25 13:05:59	Espyo	it throws a warning
2013-10-25 13:06:05	Espyo	but I could swear I already fixed it AND committed it
2013-10-25 13:06:19	Espyo	o...k, a lot of errors
2013-10-25 13:06:21	Espyo	lovely
2013-10-25 13:06:27	Espyo	mostly undefined references
2013-10-25 13:06:32	Espyo	...
2013-10-25 13:06:33	Espyo	in Portuguese
2013-10-25 13:06:58	Espyo	ah, couldn't find several of the needed Allegro packages
2013-10-25 13:06:59	Espyo	that's odd
2013-10-25 13:07:50	@J	do 'pkg-config allegro<tab><tab>', wait a few years, and when the names pop up check they're the same as in the makefile
2013-10-25 13:07:56	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-25 13:07:58	@J	line 5
2013-10-25 13:08:16	Espyo	well, the names of all addons appear
2013-10-25 13:08:22	Espyo	oh, same as in the makefile
2013-10-25 13:08:37	@J	hmm
2013-10-25 13:08:43	Espyo	ah, not exactly
2013-10-25 13:08:48	Espyo	the packages end in 5.0
2013-10-25 13:08:52	@J	great
2013-10-25 13:08:53	Espyo	the makefile has them end in 5
2013-10-25 13:09:10	@J	this is like the one thing that should be the same everywhere
2013-10-25 13:09:12	Espyo	should just be a question of editing the makefile, but... how did it work for you? were your packages different?
2013-10-25 13:09:15	Espyo	ah
2013-10-25 13:09:15	@J	and guess what, it's not
2013-10-25 13:09:30	@J	oh, actually, I have the -5.0 ones too
2013-10-25 13:09:34	@J	maybe I should've used those
2013-10-25 13:09:42	@J	just replace 5 with 5.0 everywhere then
2013-10-25 13:09:55	Espyo	right
2013-10-25 13:10:07	Espyo	and while I'm at it, maybe I should update the makefile on the repository too
2013-10-25 13:10:45	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-25 13:11:02	Espyo	no missing package errors now, but it still complains about all those undefined references
2013-10-25 13:14:32	@J	references to what?
2013-10-25 13:14:46	Espyo	usual Allegro stuff
2013-10-25 13:14:55	Espyo	al_map_rgb, al_is_event_queue_empty
2013-10-25 13:15:00	@J	hmm
2013-10-25 13:15:07	@J	let me try just sending you the binary I built
2013-10-25 13:15:11	@J	see if it works
2013-10-25 13:15:17	Espyo	but also stuff for addon functions
2013-10-25 13:15:18	Espyo	ok, sure
2013-10-25 13:17:18	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/pfe
2013-10-25 13:17:31	Espyo	now I just need to know what to do with it
2013-10-25 13:17:33	@J	hopefully glibc and allegro versions match up enough
2013-10-25 13:17:34	Espyo	or rather, how to get it
2013-10-25 13:17:41	@J	just put it next to the makefile
2013-10-25 13:17:46	Espyo	...how?
2013-10-25 13:17:53	@J	is the download not working?
2013-10-25 13:17:54	Espyo	that's pretty much my only problem
2013-10-25 13:18:03	Espyo	as for running, I just run it from the command line, no problem
2013-10-25 13:18:07	Espyo	how do I even download?
2013-10-25 13:18:10	Espyo	I mean
2013-10-25 13:18:22	Espyo	ok, back up, am I just being overlycomplicated?
2013-10-25 13:18:29	Espyo	can I just fire up Firefox, get that, and put it
2013-10-25 13:18:38	Espyo	or do I have to go through a number of commands?
2013-10-25 13:18:45	@J	yes, that's it
2013-10-25 13:18:49	Espyo	hm
2013-10-25 13:18:52	@J	it's just a file
2013-10-25 13:18:57	Espyo	it's just that everything's done so nicely in the command line
2013-10-25 13:19:02	Espyo	and then suddenly GUI programs
2013-10-25 13:19:07	@J	well, you could 'wget <url>'
2013-10-25 13:19:12	@J	or curl if it's installed
2013-10-25 13:19:54	Espyo	hm, if I had to guess
2013-10-25 13:19:57	Espyo	of /course/ you can do that
2013-10-25 13:20:07	Espyo	I had... "explorer" opened on the PFE folder
2013-10-25 13:20:18	Espyo	and when I went to the folder with the downloads, it opened a new tab
2013-10-25 13:20:25	Espyo	I assumed I could drag the file from this tab to the other one
2013-10-25 13:20:28	Espyo	and of course it worked
2013-10-25 13:20:30	@J	need to 'chmod +x pfe'
2013-10-25 13:20:35	Espyo	I forgot that minimally decent operative systems exist
2013-10-25 13:20:40	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-25 13:20:59	Espyo	well
2013-10-25 13:21:44	Espyo	ok, where to begin
2013-10-25 13:21:54	Espyo	I'm very sure it doesn't act THIS badly on your machine
2013-10-25 13:21:59	Espyo	Olimar doesn't move on his own, does he?
2013-10-25 13:22:02	Espyo	nor does the cursor
2013-10-25 13:23:59	@J	interesting
2013-10-25 13:24:12	@J	yes, in the VM, I get weird input bugs
2013-10-25 13:24:17	@J	cursor moves on its own
2013-10-25 13:24:25	@J	Olimar moves when I move the cursor
2013-10-25 13:24:28	@J	outside, none of that
2013-10-25 13:24:28	Espyo	I think I know why this is, it must think a joystick's connected
2013-10-25 13:24:32	Espyo	mouse click also dismisses, hehe
2013-10-25 13:24:35	@J	I also got the same bugs with one of my games
2013-10-25 13:24:41	Espyo	sucks
2013-10-25 13:24:43	@J	so...I don't even know
2013-10-25 13:24:46	Espyo	but other than that, C works, and
2013-10-25 13:24:50	Espyo	I do see the darkening glitch
2013-10-25 13:24:57	@J	maybe a recent VirtualBox update got buggy or something
2013-10-25 13:24:58	Espyo	it looks kinda cool, but
2013-10-25 13:25:03	Espyo	yeah, maybe
2013-10-25 13:25:05	@J	I don't remember this happening before
2013-10-25 13:25:11	@J	with games I've made in VMs
2013-10-25 13:25:25	@J	anyway, I have to go very soon
2013-10-25 13:25:31	Espyo	right
2013-10-25 13:25:43	Espyo	well, even if I fiddle around, I'd still have to compile it to retest it
2013-10-25 13:25:49	Espyo	so I'll have to fix those errors eventually
2013-10-25 13:25:52	Espyo	but thanks for the help still
2013-10-25 13:26:00	@J	no problem
2013-10-25 13:26:16	@J	oh
2013-10-25 13:26:21	@J	you probably need dev packages
2013-10-25 13:26:24	@J	Ubuntu does that
2013-10-25 13:26:33	@J	headers aren't included in the lib packages, you need a separate one
2013-10-25 13:26:34	Espyo	but I do have them
2013-10-25 13:26:36	@J	oh
2013-10-25 13:26:37	@J	hmm
2013-10-25 13:26:49	@J	maybe you missed some?
2013-10-25 13:26:58	Espyo	doesn't really look like it
2013-10-25 13:26:59	@J	or maybe you just need to run ldconfig
2013-10-25 13:27:03	@J	so try rebooting the VM
2013-10-25 13:27:08	Espyo	also when you miss one, you only get linker errors to functions regarding that addon, right?
2013-10-25 13:27:14	Espyo	I get linker errors about normal Allegro stuff
2013-10-25 13:27:18	Espyo	ah yes, reboot
2013-10-25 13:27:18	@J	hmm
2013-10-25 13:27:28	@J	rebooting shouldn't be required, but who knows
2013-10-25 13:27:38	Espyo	oh, I...
2013-10-25 13:27:45	Espyo	had no idea Lubuntu was so opposed to the idea of being paused
2013-10-25 13:27:54	Espyo	I unpaused the VM and it became completely black
2013-10-25 13:27:57	Espyo	...meh, reboot
2013-10-25 13:27:57	@J	weird
2013-10-25 13:28:04	@J	try resizing the VB window
2013-10-25 13:28:16	Espyo	tried minimizing and restoring, but too late to try a resize
2013-10-25 13:28:22	@J	anyway, bye
2013-10-25 13:28:26	@J	see you in a few days
2013-10-25 13:29:19	Espyo	bye

2013-10-26 18:29:42	@PikFan	.
2013-10-26 18:31:35	Espyo	hey
2013-10-26 19:01:54	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/HP#Leaders
2013-10-26 19:02:09	@PikFan	"The same rule applies to caves, but the cave is immediately left (all salvaged treasures will still be saved), all Pikmin in the cave are left behind, and hence, count as deaths"
2013-10-26 19:02:29	@PikFan	I thought the treasures and the Pikmin were left behind?
2013-10-26 19:02:49	Espyo	here's the thing: I can't know for sure because my save file has all treasures
2013-10-26 19:02:56	Espyo	but when I died, I was taken to the "Treasures Salvaged" screen
2013-10-26 19:03:07	Espyo	so I assumed that all salvaged treasures would be saved
2013-10-26 19:03:25	@PikFan	it always does that whenever you leave a cave
2013-10-26 19:03:54	@PikFan	but I'd imagine you'd lose your treasure as well
2013-10-26 19:03:59	@PikFan	brb, I'll test
2013-10-26 19:07:05	Espyo	wait
2013-10-26 19:07:13	Espyo	I have some save files with 3 or 4 days into the game
2013-10-26 19:07:17	Espyo	I should be able to test on those 
2013-10-26 19:08:41	@PikFan	back
2013-10-26 19:08:51	@PikFan	and it's just as I thought
2013-10-26 19:09:13	@PikFan	you lose any spoils when the leaders die
2013-10-26 19:09:23	Espyo	ah
2013-10-26 19:09:27	Espyo	ok, please fix it then
2013-10-26 19:09:42	@PikFan	yep
2013-10-26 19:09:50	Espyo	also I'm not sure on another thing
2013-10-26 19:09:53	Espyo	that one's a lot easier to test
2013-10-26 19:10:05	Espyo	if both leaders get KO'd in P2, and there are Pikmin with them
2013-10-26 19:10:07	Espyo	do they get left behind?
2013-10-26 19:10:13	Espyo	[[Leader]] says they do, but...
2013-10-26 19:10:18	@PikFan	yes
2013-10-26 19:10:33	@PikFan	when I killed both my captains, the spoils and the Pikmin were left behind
2013-10-26 19:10:42	@PikFan	or do you mean above ground?
2013-10-26 19:10:46	Espyo	above
2013-10-26 19:10:57	@PikFan	possibly, not sure
2013-10-26 19:11:18	@PikFan	if they were left in the landing site, maybe
2013-10-26 19:11:25	@PikFan	I'll test again
2013-10-26 19:15:23	@PikFan	okay that's weird
2013-10-26 19:15:42	@PikFan	it says that my Pikmin pops went down, but
2013-10-26 19:15:54	@PikFan	I don't see any deaths
2013-10-26 19:16:40	@PikFan	and also, I only saw a few spirits as the Ship was blasting off
2013-10-26 19:16:58	@PikFan	I didn't see a large swarm of Pikmin scurrying around
2013-10-26 19:17:31	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-26 19:18:00	@PikFan	okay, maybe things'll make more sense if I leave them out of the landing area
2013-10-26 19:18:18	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-26 19:19:37	-->	Gamefreak75 (Fassad@gje-23-80-243-717.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #pikipedia
2013-10-26 19:21:22	@PikFan	they do make more sense
2013-10-26 19:21:39	@PikFan	I left them out of the landing site, and I saw all my Pikmin scurrying around
2013-10-26 19:21:48	@PikFan	and I saw that 84 Pikmin died to sunset
2013-10-26 19:22:14	@PikFan	so does the game get confused when you leave them /in/ the landing site...?
2013-10-26 19:23:05	Espyo	maybe
2013-10-26 19:23:26	Espyo	but yeah, I think that info's wrong on [[HP]] as well then
2013-10-26 19:24:44	@PikFan	oh and also
2013-10-26 19:24:58	@PikFan	when the leaders' health goes under 50%, the music plays slower
2013-10-26 19:25:04	@PikFan	so yet another music variation
2013-10-26 19:26:01	@PikFan	also
2013-10-26 19:26:22	@PikFan	when the captains leave the cave with some HP lost, they'll regain it when they come out
2013-10-26 19:27:22	@PikFan	"If the leaders leave the cave, having lost some HP, they will regain it upon returning to the surface."
2013-10-26 19:27:26	@PikFan	how's that?
2013-10-26 19:33:00	Espyo	it does?
2013-10-26 19:33:02	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-26 19:33:12	Espyo	ah, had no idea about leaving the cave
2013-10-26 19:33:22	Espyo	hmm, let me try a different wording
2013-10-26 19:33:39	Espyo	"Upon leaving a cave, the leaders' HP will be replenished."
2013-10-26 19:33:56	Espyo	your sentence gives the idea that they only regain a fixed amount
2013-10-26 19:34:19	Espyo	also another variation I noticed
2013-10-26 19:34:35	Espyo	that might or might not overlap the slowing down due to low health
2013-10-26 19:34:46	Espyo	if you get hit, the music will get heavily distorted
2013-10-26 19:35:00	Espyo	yesterday, I took some time to figure out exactly what all sections of the boss theme are, and when they play
2013-10-26 19:35:05	@PikFan	yeah, for a moment
2013-10-26 19:35:13	Espyo	mhm, for a moment
2013-10-26 19:35:15	Espyo	there are basically 5:
2013-10-26 19:35:23	Espyo	the normal theme, happens normally (duh)
2013-10-26 19:35:59	Espyo	there's the pre-attack theme, which happens when the Empress Bulblax and RLL shake Pikmin off, 
2013-10-26 19:36:29	Espyo	there's the attack theme, used when Empress rolls, Man-at-Legs shoots, Segmented Crawbster rolls, and RLL stomps fast
2013-10-26 19:37:17	Espyo	there's the smaller attack theme(s), that play when the Emperor Bulblax uses his tongue, when the Snagrets get out of the ground, and when the Ranging Bloyster uses its tongues
2013-10-26 19:37:43	@PikFan	yeah, themes, because 4 variations play
2013-10-26 19:37:43	Espyo	there are 3 of those themes, which sound like the attack theme
2013-10-26 19:38:01	Espyo	when a "smaller attack" theme has to play, it plays theme A
2013-10-26 19:38:06	Espyo	next time it plays B, next time C
2013-10-26 19:38:10	Espyo	then next time A, and the cycle loops
2013-10-26 19:38:24	@PikFan	you're missing the 4th one, though
2013-10-26 19:38:48	Espyo	and finally there's a crescendo (that's the wrong term, I'm still finding the correct one), that plays when the Emperor jumps, when BLL shakes, when Snagrets dig down, when the Man-at-Legs shakes, and when the Segmented Crawbster swipes
2013-10-26 19:39:06	@PikFan	theme A ‚Äî-> theme B ‚Äî-> theme C ‚Äî-> theme D
2013-10-26 19:39:07	Espyo	and of course, the good ol' boss defeated theme
2013-10-26 19:39:20	Espyo	hmm?
2013-10-26 19:39:23	Espyo	no, there are only 3
2013-10-26 19:39:31	Espyo	 3 of the "smaller attack" themes
2013-10-26 19:39:36	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure there's 4
2013-10-26 19:39:47	Espyo	I'm basing myself on a MIDI file, to be honest
2013-10-26 19:39:51	Espyo	but either way, in-game, I heard 3
2013-10-26 19:40:01	Espyo	and I lured an Emperor into using its tongue at me like 30 times in a row
2013-10-26 19:40:13	Espyo	at times it didn't swipe its tongue, so I could make him attack in rapid succession, it was funny
2013-10-26 19:40:17	Espyo	and I'm pretty sure I only heard 3
2013-10-26 19:40:27	Espyo	let me find the song on yt that has that theme
2013-10-26 19:43:51	@PikFan	odd
2013-10-26 19:43:55	@PikFan	pretty sure there's 4
2013-10-26 19:43:58	@PikFan	let me check
2013-10-26 19:46:15	Espyo	...
2013-10-26 19:46:15	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wPBLM92yI
2013-10-26 19:46:22	Espyo	it's at 0:25
2013-10-26 19:46:26	Espyo	it's HORRIBLY mashed in
2013-10-26 19:46:34	Espyo	but that's what it is
2013-10-26 19:48:01	@PikFan	yeah, I heard 4 variations
2013-10-26 19:48:22	@PikFan	not in the video, but in the game
2013-10-26 19:48:58	@PikFan	there are only 3 in the video
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	you hear one of the "smaller attack" themes
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	then normal music
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	then the second
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	then normal
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	then the thir
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	*d
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	then normal
2013-10-26 19:49:36	Espyo	and then there's that "crescendo"
2013-10-26 19:49:46	Espyo	...how can that be?
2013-10-26 19:49:57	Espyo	what were you doing when you heard them?
2013-10-26 19:50:22	@PikFan	just... making the Emperor Bulblax use its tounge
2013-10-26 19:50:28	@PikFan	*tongue 
2013-10-26 19:50:59	Espyo	and you heard 4?
2013-10-26 19:50:59	Espyo	are you absolutely positive?
2013-10-26 19:50:59	@PikFan	there are 4 "smaller attack" themes, I'm sure of it
2013-10-26 19:51:07	@PikFan	yeah
2013-10-26 19:51:15	@PikFan	go to sublevel 4 of the CoC
2013-10-26 19:53:10	@PikFan	get a Bulblax up, and have it use its tounge
2013-10-26 19:53:10	@PikFan	*tongue
2013-10-26 19:53:10	@PikFan	gah
2013-10-26 19:53:10	Espyo	are you sure the 4th wasn't the crescendo that's on that video at 0:39?
2013-10-26 19:53:27	@PikFan	yes
2013-10-26 19:53:35	Testyo	PikFan is flooding!
2013-10-26 19:53:46	@PikFan	hush, Testyo
2013-10-26 19:53:47	Espyo	shush Testyo
2013-10-26 19:53:54	Espyo	heh
2013-10-26 19:54:52	Espyo	that's so peculiar
2013-10-26 19:54:54	Espyo	but I'll go try
2013-10-26 19:54:59	Espyo	did you set your SFX to 0 volume?
2013-10-26 19:55:05	Espyo	I doubt it has anything to do with that, but
2013-10-26 19:55:25	@PikFan	no, but I'm very sure that I heard 4 variations
2013-10-26 19:55:29	@PikFan	I'll go listen again
2013-10-26 19:55:41	Espyo	make sure you identify and isolate a theme
2013-10-26 19:56:02	Espyo	like if you have him attack you too repeatedly, you might be hearing the normal theme and thinking it's part of his tongue attack theme
2013-10-26 19:56:18	Espyo	also if he jumps, he does the crescendo; you said it wasn't that theme, but just make sure you don't go under him
2013-10-26 19:56:56	Espyo	right now, my only bet is that there's another theme in the US version
2013-10-26 19:57:01	Espyo	but there's very unlikely
2013-10-26 19:57:35	Espyo	they wouldn't change that up for no reason, and besides, all music I find that has that only has 3
2013-10-26 19:57:42	Espyo	on the other hand, you mentioned hearing 4 before you did this test on CoC
2013-10-26 19:57:49	Espyo	and now that you did the test, you re-confirmed 4
2013-10-26 20:00:18	@PikFan	yep
2013-10-26 20:00:33	@PikFan	I remember doing it with the Snagrets in the Snagret Hole
2013-10-26 20:00:52	@PikFan	and it's only his tongue that's attacking
2013-10-26 20:01:05	@PikFan	I'm making sure he's not jumping
2013-10-26 20:01:43	Espyo	and still 4 themes?
2013-10-26 20:01:53	Espyo	I don't suppose you can record that somehow?
2013-10-26 20:02:09	Espyo	maybe with a microphone pointing at the TV, and recording with Audacity...
2013-10-26 20:02:52	Espyo	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2013-10-26 20:02:57	Espyo	I think I heard 4 as well now
2013-10-26 20:03:01	Espyo	they differ very slightly
2013-10-26 20:03:04	Espyo	maybe
2013-10-26 20:03:07	Espyo	I'll keep going at it
2013-10-26 20:04:13	Espyo	they're too similar for me to reach any conclusion
2013-10-26 20:04:19	Espyo	I'll go on Dolphin and rip them there
2013-10-26 20:04:21	Espyo	and then I'll compare
2013-10-26 20:04:33	@PikFan	it's like highest -> low -> high -> lowest
2013-10-26 20:04:48	Espyo	it seems to be randomly picked to me, actually
2013-10-26 20:05:17	@PikFan	pretty sure that it isn't
2013-10-26 20:05:29	@PikFan	I can hear it going in a pattern
2013-10-26 20:06:22	Espyo	ok
2013-10-26 20:06:28	Espyo	there's definitely something going on here then
2013-10-26 20:06:37	Espyo	your order there seems about right
2013-10-26 20:06:40	Espyo	I can see now that it does repeat
2013-10-26 20:06:51	Espyo	but low and lowest are ALMOST the exact same
2013-10-26 20:06:57	Espyo	only the second to last note changes
2013-10-26 20:07:08	Espyo	on the lowest one, that note is lower than normal
2013-10-26 20:07:20	Espyo	on the low one, the second to last note is near the rest in pitch
2013-10-26 20:08:38	@PikFan	yeah, they do sound similar
2013-10-26 20:08:55	Espyo	yeah, it's confirmed
2013-10-26 20:10:13	Espyo	there are 4
2013-10-26 20:10:40	@PikFan	yep
2013-10-26 20:10:42	Espyo	maybe
2013-10-26 20:11:29	Espyo	I think setting them all together makes up for the long attack theme
2013-10-26 20:11:29	Espyo	for science, I shall rip them using Dolphin
2013-10-26 20:11:39	@PikFan	>for science
2013-10-26 20:11:41	@PikFan	hehehehe
2013-10-26 20:12:33	Espyo	our wiki is a science
2013-10-26 20:12:45	@PikFan	ah, yes
2013-10-26 20:13:05	@PikFan	so by "for science" you mean "for Pikipedia"
2013-10-26 20:13:20	Espyo	in a way, yeah
2013-10-26 20:28:12	Espyo	ok, this should be good
2013-10-26 20:28:58	Espyo	...good thing the tempo doesn't change with the President
2013-10-26 20:29:00	Espyo	...does it?
2013-10-26 20:29:14	@PikFan	hmm?
2013-10-26 20:29:51	Espyo	the boss theme
2013-10-26 20:29:56	Espyo	it doesn't change tempo if you have the President out
2013-10-26 20:30:07	@PikFan	I don't think so, no
2013-10-26 20:39:57	Espyo	well, that was a bit disappointing
2013-10-26 20:40:06	Espyo	I assumed Dolphin would make a clean dump of the audio
2013-10-26 20:40:11	Espyo	but it has some minor crackles
2013-10-26 20:40:16	Espyo	well, you can still get the idea though
2013-10-26 20:40:52	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/small%20attack.wav
2013-10-26 20:52:57	Espyo	I thought you said you fixed the info on [[HP]]
2013-10-26 20:54:06	@PikFan	I did
2013-10-26 20:54:25	@PikFan	did I make a mistake somewhere?
2013-10-26 20:54:40	@PikFan	...
2013-10-26 20:54:44	@PikFan	I didn't even save it
2013-10-26 20:55:40	Espyo	:/
2013-10-26 20:55:58	Espyo	so, it was about treasures being left behind and about...
2013-10-26 20:56:01	@PikFan	don't worry, I'm redoing it right now
2013-10-26 20:56:04	Espyo	uh, you didn't really test what I asked
2013-10-26 20:56:27	Espyo	my doubt was whether Pikmin with you would be lost if you died
2013-10-26 20:56:52	@PikFan	above ground or in caves?
2013-10-26 20:57:46	Espyo	above ground
2013-10-26 20:57:58	@PikFan	I did test that
2013-10-26 20:58:01	Espyo	though if you could, testing on caves would be good too
2013-10-26 20:58:18	Espyo	oh, I thought you tested with Pikmin outside the Onions' ranges, but not on the party
2013-10-26 20:58:26	Espyo	...which in retrospect, isn't something you'd do
2013-10-26 20:58:30	@PikFan	yeah, I did that
2013-10-26 20:58:44	Espyo	right
2013-10-26 20:58:56	@PikFan	and when I tested inside the Onions' ranges, the game became confused
2013-10-26 20:59:08	Espyo	right
2013-10-26 20:59:30	@PikFan	(wanted to make it more dramatic by saying the game exploded)

2013-10-26 21:03:02	Espyo	 2:07
2013-10-26 21:03:19	Espyo	yeah, it only shows 3
2013-10-26 21:03:39	Espyo	and I think the guy that made this demake and the guy that made the midi I base myself on must've read from a common note sheet
2013-10-26 21:03:45	Espyo	and the problem is on the note sheet
2013-10-26 21:06:51	Espyo	looks like this guy based himself on the same note sheet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxKg0dj7IlA
2013-10-26 21:10:23	@PikFan	sounds like something in Pikmin 3

2013-10-26 21:44:25	Espyo	thanks
2013-10-26 21:46:29	@PikFan	yw
2013-10-26 21:49:59	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/small%20attack.wav I updated it real quick
2013-10-26 21:50:08	Espyo	first, it's each theme in order
2013-10-26 21:50:14	Espyo	then it's all of them together, still in order
2013-10-26 21:50:26	Espyo	now, I added, at the end, 1324 together
2013-10-26 21:50:38	Espyo	makes it even easier to tell that yes, all 4 are different
2013-10-26 21:51:46	@PikFan	I can't hear it
2013-10-26 21:52:55	Espyo	why's that?
2013-10-26 21:53:42	@PikFan	well, it says "Activate QuickTime. This plugin is vulnerable and should be updated."
2013-10-26 21:54:31	Espyo	...how did you listen to it last time then?
2013-10-26 21:54:45	@PikFan	I didn't
2013-10-26 21:54:52	Espyo	...
2013-10-26 21:55:03	Espyo	well, download the file and play it from your computer then

2013-10-27 17:27:17	Espyo	Testyo: memo PikFan that weird WW sunset variation happens whether you enter a cave or not
2013-10-27 17:27:18	Testyo	Done. I saved a memo for PikFan saying: that weird WW sunset variation happens whether you enter a cave or not.
2013-10-27 17:54:21	Miles	Weird WW sunset variation?
2013-10-27 17:56:13	Espyo	yeah, the main lead sounds like a broken tuba, or maybe some other wind instrument
2013-10-27 17:56:19	Espyo	and the background flute becomes a pan flute
2013-10-27 17:56:29	Espyo	this theme lasts for a single loop
2013-10-27 17:56:51	Espyo	and then the normal lead and background flute theme plays for the rest of the sunset
2013-10-27 17:57:09	Miles	Didn't realize that the loop being different wasn't known
2013-10-27 17:57:27	Espyo	in retrospect, it's obvious
2013-10-27 17:57:41	Espyo	but PikFan had the idea that it only happened if you leaved a cave during sunset
2013-10-27 17:57:51	Espyo	and somehow I don't remember that different loop at all
2013-10-27 17:57:58	Espyo	I only realized it existed when I took a listen at the OST itself
2013-10-27 17:58:06	Espyo	well, by OST, I mean random rips people try
2013-10-27 17:58:33	Miles	"When in a cave, the more Pikmin that have been lost since entry, the less instruments play; these changes occur when 75%, 50% and 25% of the Pikmin have been lost."
2013-10-27 17:58:34	Miles	What
2013-10-27 18:01:52	Espyo	is that not right?
2013-10-27 18:02:06	Espyo	also I'm currently editing that article
2013-10-27 18:02:12	Espyo	that's why the whole music thing's been brought up
2013-10-27 18:02:24	Espyo	I don't even notice a single instrument drop, but everyone says they do
2013-10-27 18:02:27	Miles	Well, I know massacres above ground change the music
2013-10-27 18:02:35	Miles	I hadn't heard of it being so specific
2013-10-27 18:02:48	Espyo	well, shouldn't be hard to try
2013-10-27 18:02:58	Espyo	metallic cave + throwing Pikmin off the abyss
2013-10-27 18:03:04	Espyo	going to check then
2013-10-27 18:08:20	Espyo	ok, can't tell a difference between 75 and 74
2013-10-27 18:09:42	Espyo	...it's the same song with 1 Pikmin
2013-10-27 18:09:51	Espyo	maybe it only changes in the overworld?
2013-10-27 18:13:15	Espyo	ok, in the overworld, less notes play
2013-10-27 18:13:17	Espyo	that's for sure

2013-10-27 18:26:23	Espyo	ok, so when your army drops to 9 or less because of a massacre, some of the notes on the main instrument don't play
2013-10-27 18:26:32	Espyo	and I don't notice that in caves at all
2013-10-27 18:30:17	Espyo	...looks like the "massacre" doesn't really have to be catastrophic
2013-10-27 18:30:29	Espyo	if you pull out 10, and 1 dies, you get this sad remix where some notes don't play

2013-10-28 22:18:06	Espyo	pointed to the file, but it's not a valid format for a VirtualBox disk

2013-10-28 22:19:57	Espyo	I know about .tar.gz and all
2013-10-28 22:20:10	Espyo	this isn't the same, but
2013-10-28 22:20:18	Espyo	at the very least, it could've made me realize that maybe it was zipped
2013-10-28 22:20:30	Espyo	AND on top of that, the file's icon on explorer is a 7-zip styled folder

2013-10-28 22:21:02	Espyo	yeah
2013-10-28 22:21:09	Espyo	I know .7z files have a 7 on the top
2013-10-28 22:21:13	Espyo	.zip have Z
2013-10-28 22:21:22	Espyo	anyway, what distro is this?
2013-10-28 22:21:31	Espyo	VB would like to know
2013-10-28 22:21:34	@J	Arch
2013-10-28 22:21:36	@J	32-bit
2013-10-28 22:21:57	Espyo	I... guess I'll go with 512MB RAM
2013-10-28 22:23:41	Espyo	it probably has your credentials, though
2013-10-28 22:24:11	Espyo	yep
2013-10-28 22:24:16	@J	you're at the login prompt?
2013-10-28 22:24:20	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-28 22:24:24	@J	user: j, password: pikmin
2013-10-28 22:24:27	@J	...I think
2013-10-28 22:24:48	Espyo	success
2013-10-28 22:25:07	@J	now 'startx'
2013-10-28 22:25:16	Espyo	aww, the keyboard layout
2013-10-28 22:25:30	@J	oh, I thought I switched it
2013-10-28 22:25:33	Espyo	oh, I was just getting ready to run it from the command line
2013-10-28 22:25:36	@J	oh, it's UK QWERTY?
2013-10-28 22:25:41	Espyo	mine's PT QWERTTY
2013-10-28 22:25:43	Espyo	*QWERTY
2013-10-28 22:25:44	@J	ah
2013-10-28 22:25:50	@J	I thought you meant I left it in Dvorak
2013-10-28 22:25:54	Espyo	yeah, letters are ok
2013-10-28 22:26:07	@J	better to change it once logged in
2013-10-28 22:26:09	Espyo	it's just the dashes and such
2013-10-28 22:26:22	@J	and yeah, it wouldn't work without a display...
2013-10-28 22:26:33	@J	so...I don't think I installed a file manager
2013-10-28 22:26:42	@J	a terminal should start up on login
2013-10-28 22:26:49	Espyo	I figured
2013-10-28 22:26:58	Espyo	hm, the glitch really must be a VB problem
2013-10-28 22:27:00	Espyo	I mean the analog glitch
2013-10-28 22:27:45	Espyo	yep, still the zoom problem
2013-10-28 22:27:55	Espyo	runs a lot smoother than on Lubuntu
2013-10-28 22:28:00	Espyo	and I have a ton of crap open this time
2013-10-28 22:28:08	Espyo	well, make should work right away, but better make sure
2013-10-28 22:28:21	Espyo	oh, no changes, right
2013-10-28 22:28:56	Espyo	hmmmmm
2013-10-28 22:29:13	Espyo	your "pkg-config ‚Äîlibs allegro-5.0" returns "-lallegro"
2013-10-28 22:29:19	@J	I thought you didn't get it to- oh, right, forgot I compiled it for you
2013-10-28 22:29:23	Espyo	on Lubuntu it returned something different
2013-10-28 22:29:32	@J	I assume 'make' works here, then
2013-10-28 22:29:39	@J	'make clean' first to remove the executable
2013-10-28 22:29:41	Espyo	no files to change, so can't tell for sure
2013-10-28 22:29:43	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-28 22:29:49	Espyo	...
2013-10-28 22:29:55	Espyo	I just wrote "mhm clean" on the prompt
2013-10-28 22:29:58	@J	nice
2013-10-28 22:30:43	Espyo	yep, works fine
2013-10-28 22:30:50	Espyo	oh, before I forget: I tried making the window resizable
2013-10-28 22:31:02	Espyo	but Allegro does /something/
2013-10-28 22:31:14	Espyo	it stretches the image whether I want it or not
2013-10-28 22:31:22	Espyo	I'm not sure if it's meant to do that or not
2013-10-28 22:32:12	Espyo	it's going to be tough to fix
2013-10-28 22:32:17	Espyo	but I can at least try stuff now
2013-10-28 22:32:18	Espyo	thanks
2013-10-28 22:32:29	Espyo	hmm, should really move the hdd image somewhere else
2013-10-28 22:35:25	Espyo	gah
2013-10-28 22:35:30	Espyo	really isn't making my life easy
2013-10-28 22:35:42	Espyo	there's no good way to move it after you've already created the VM
2013-10-28 22:41:42	@J	meh, it's not like you did much work to create the VM
2013-10-28 22:42:03	Espyo	ok, I got around it eventually
2013-10-28 22:47:15	@J	anyway, not really sure why it runs smoother than with Lubuntu
2013-10-28 22:47:33	@J	maybe just because stuff is more up-to-date and there's less other stuff going on
2013-10-28 22:47:38	Espyo	looking at it again, it only runs a bit smoother
2013-10-28 22:47:44	Espyo	nothing extraordinary
2013-10-28 22:48:01	@J	mm
2013-10-28 22:51:35	@J	what's your VirtualBox version?
2013-10-28 22:51:57	Espyo	 4.2.18 r88780
2013-10-28 22:52:24	@J	weird we'd both have the input bug, then, since I have 4.3.0
2013-10-28 22:52:38	@J	no idea how old 4.2.18 is, though
2013-10-28 22:52:56	Espyo	not too old
2013-10-28 22:53:00	Espyo	I updated around 2 weeks ago
2013-10-28 22:53:10	@J	seems to be early September
2013-10-28 22:53:12	Espyo	in fact, I updated when you told me about it
2013-10-28 22:53:26	@J	told you about what?
2013-10-28 22:53:27	Espyo	when you told me about the glitch, I mean
2013-10-28 22:53:30	@J	oh
2013-10-28 22:53:30	Espyo	the darkening glitch
2013-10-28 22:53:34	Espyo	which started the whole thing
2013-10-28 22:53:41	@J	hmm, weird you didn't get 4.3, then
2013-10-28 22:53:54	@J	ah, I got 4.3 a week ago
2013-10-28 22:56:14	@J	[22:29:13] Espyo your "pkg-config ‚Äîlibs allegro-5.0" returns "-lallegro"
2013-10-28 22:56:16	@J	[22:29:23] Espyo on Lubuntu it returned something different
2013-10-28 22:56:23	@J	this shouldn't matter
2013-10-28 22:56:33	Espyo	well, couldn't figure out any other reason
2013-10-28 22:56:40	@J	the point of pkg-config is to turn something system-independent into the right thing
2013-10-28 22:57:06	@J	but I guess it might still be worth looking at that difference
2013-10-28 22:57:48	Espyo	I think it returned...
2013-10-28 22:57:56	Espyo	I think it was the library's names, and that was it
2013-10-28 22:58:22	@J	without -l?  That sounds wrong
2013-10-28 22:58:22	Espyo	well, one thing I did notice is that no matter what I tried with pkg-config, it never returned the library's locations, "-L"
2013-10-28 22:58:36	Espyo	I'll check for sure what it returned
2013-10-28 22:58:44	@J	it won't do if they're in a path that's already searched
2013-10-28 22:59:05	Espyo	not quite sure it's in a system default path
2013-10-28 22:59:15	Espyo	and from my Google searches, it's in a different place than normal
2013-10-28 23:00:28	@J	7.  The default directories, normally /lib and /usr/lib.
2013-10-28 23:00:38	@J	8.  For a native linker on an ELF system, if the file
2013-10-28 23:00:38	@J	               /etc/ld.so.conf exists, the list of directories found in that
2013-10-28 23:00:38	@J	               file.
2013-10-28 23:00:56	@J	you could try doing it manually, then
2013-10-28 23:01:12	Espyo	mhm
2013-10-28 23:01:19	@J	make LDFLAGS='-L stuff'
2013-10-28 23:02:00	Espyo	...it's returning "-lallegro"
2013-10-28 23:02:17	@J	I thought that was the same as Arch
2013-10-28 23:02:28	Espyo	maybe a reboot made it goo- nope, still giving linker errors
2013-10-28 23:02:37	@J	oh, I see
2013-10-28 23:02:40	@J	weird
2013-10-28 23:02:49	@J	by which I mean you clearly misremembered
2013-10-28 23:03:07	Espyo	maybe it changed since I rebooted
2013-10-28 23:04:04	@J	well, where is allegro, then?
2013-10-28 23:04:16	@J	I have /usr/lib/liballegro*.so
2013-10-28 23:04:29	Espyo	nope, not there, that's for sure
2013-10-28 23:04:31	Espyo	I'll use the search
2013-10-28 23:06:00	Espyo	...don't remember it being so slow last time I checked
2013-10-28 23:06:17	@J	how are you searching?
2013-10-28 23:06:57	Espyo	using "explorer"
2013-10-28 23:07:15	@J	maybe it's using find/similar
2013-10-28 23:07:21	Espyo	oh, here it is
2013-10-28 23:07:23	@J	try 'locate liballegro' in a terminal
2013-10-28 23:07:26	Espyo	it needed wildcards
2013-10-28 23:08:17	Espyo	liballegro.so.5.0.10, in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu
2013-10-28 23:09:50	@J	hmm, weird that it would put it under the compiler
2013-10-28 23:09:57	@J	it's as if that's not the default architecture

2013-10-28 23:11:52	Espyo	it does
2013-10-28 23:14:11	@J	wait, so how does the executable I sent you even work?
2013-10-28 23:14:41	Espyo	*shrug*
2013-10-28 23:15:19	@J	are you sure you don't have a /usr/lib/liballegro*.so.5.0
2013-10-28 23:15:53	@J	because that's where it points, which you'll see by doing 'ldd pfe'
2013-10-28 23:17:20	Espyo	...where in the world did it go
2013-10-28 23:17:23	Espyo	the executable vanishes
2013-10-28 23:17:25	Espyo	*vanished
2013-10-28 23:17:34	Espyo	and I'm sure I never did a clean

2013-10-28 23:21:43	Espyo	ldd pfe gives a lot of things
2013-10-28 23:24:13	@J	the allegro ones, after the arrow
2013-10-28 23:24:53	@J	well, I don't know, there's no reason it shouldn't work
2013-10-28 23:25:24	@J	in other news, I finally played FTL

2013-10-28 23:27:23	@J	maybe I don't know how ldd works
2013-10-28 23:27:45	@J	it probably searches in paths like the linker

2013-10-28 23:28:18	Espyo	right

2013-10-29 20:03:35	@J	beep
2013-10-29 20:06:22	Espyo	hey
2013-10-29 20:06:31	Espyo	so I've just about finished rewriting the control system
2013-10-29 20:06:39	Espyo	now you don't need to recompile to change the controls
2013-10-29 20:06:42	Espyo	and everything works with everything
2013-10-29 20:07:04	Espyo	to move right, you can press D or hold the first analog stick right
2013-10-29 20:07:12	Espyo	and the game cannot care less about the differences between the two
2013-10-29 20:07:26	Espyo	only thing is the analog stick is worth how much you're holding to the right, whereas the D key is worth 100% all the time
2013-10-29 20:08:10	@J	still just QWERTY?
2013-10-29 20:08:18	@J	WASD, I should say
2013-10-29 20:08:25	Espyo	QWERTY WASD, yes
2013-10-29 20:08:45	Espyo	I suppose just setting it to those letters you said would also work
2013-10-29 20:08:57	Espyo	but... I'd rather not have people suddenly press U and try to figure out why their character just moved
2013-10-29 20:09:07	Espyo	you can now edit keys easily and all, so
2013-10-29 20:09:10	Espyo	well... /kinda/ easily
2013-10-29 20:09:16	Espyo	you'd have to know what a key's number is
2013-10-29 20:09:26	@J	is it pushed?
2013-10-29 20:09:29	Espyo	on the bright side, A is 1, so it's easy to find letters
2013-10-29 20:09:38	Espyo	is what pushed?
2013-10-29 20:09:42	@J	code, to GitHub
2013-10-29 20:10:03	Espyo	ah, not yet
2013-10-29 20:10:05	Espyo	in a sec
2013-10-29 20:10:13	Espyo	it's basically done, I was ironing the last glitch when you joined
2013-10-29 20:10:37	Espyo	oh, and this can be used to fix the joystick problem on VMs
2013-10-29 20:10:47	Espyo	just go to the options file and remove all mentions to joystick buttons and axes
2013-10-29 20:12:19	Espyo	hm, still need to write code to load other options
2013-10-29 20:12:25	Espyo	these shouldn't take nearly as long
2013-10-29 20:13:35	Espyo	I don't know if I should make the daylight effect optional
2013-10-29 20:13:51	Espyo	it helps performance if it's disabled, but it's kind of a mechanic
2013-10-29 20:14:03	Espyo	mostly on PikFan's game, where you can explore a bit at night, and the purpose is for it to be dark
2013-10-29 20:17:15	Espyo	note to self: for awesome bullet-time mode, make sure you load the fps setting after creating the timer that should've gotten that value
2013-10-29 20:18:22	Espyo	ok, it works fine at 60fps
2013-10-29 20:18:30	Espyo	that's a relief, I figured it'd start choking by now
2013-10-29 20:27:09	@J	[20:09:16] Espyo you'd have to know what a key's number is
2013-10-29 20:27:24	Espyo	by the numbering Allegro uses
2013-10-29 20:27:26	@J	is it not easy to use letters/
2013-10-29 20:27:27	@J	*?
2013-10-29 20:27:33	Espyo	letters are easy
2013-10-29 20:27:36	Espyo	specially because A is 1
2013-10-29 20:27:42	@J	I mean
2013-10-29 20:27:44	Espyo	the rest of the keys however...
2013-10-29 20:27:54	@J	is it not easy to use names for keys in the config file
2013-10-29 20:28:07	Espyo	well, yes
2013-10-29 20:28:17	Espyo	and Allegro does have a way to return the name of a key
2013-10-29 20:28:35	Espyo	but you'd have to know the exact name
2013-10-29 20:28:36	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-29 20:28:42	Espyo	but I'll give it a try, see if it's awkward
2013-10-29 20:28:46	@J	better than needing the number
2013-10-29 20:28:50	Espyo	oh, what about when you type 3?
2013-10-29 20:28:56	Espyo	do you mean the [3] key, or the [C] key?
2013-10-29 20:28:57	@J	and you can easily guess letters
2013-10-29 20:29:06	@J	always use names, so 3 means the 3 key
2013-10-29 20:29:12	Espyo	hm
2013-10-29 20:29:20	Espyo	I hope some names won't break anything
2013-10-29 20:29:24	Espyo	they might have spaces and whatnot
2013-10-29 20:29:35	@J	I doubt it
2013-10-29 20:29:46	@J	aren't they available in an enum or something?
2013-10-29 20:29:54	@J	in which case they're variable names, so can't have spaces
2013-10-29 20:30:46	@J	(in the case of my game engine input system, I used a shell lexer to parse words from lines, so you can quote arguments with spaces without any extra work)
2013-10-29 20:31:16	Espyo	heh, I can't just get a name from an enum
2013-10-29 20:31:22	Espyo	this isn't Python
2013-10-29 20:31:25	@J	[20:13:51] Espyo it helps performance if it's disabled, but it's kind of a mechanic
2013-10-29 20:31:39	Espyo	I made it disableable for now, anyway
2013-10-29 20:31:43	@J	I never really had a problem with performance
2013-10-29 20:31:45	Espyo	should help in these testing phases
2013-10-29 20:31:49	Espyo	for now
2013-10-29 20:31:53	@J	no, you want the number from the name
2013-10-29 20:32:06	@J	oh, you mean you can't extract all names in an enum
2013-10-29 20:32:07	@J	?
2013-10-29 20:32:08	Espyo	just you wait until 100 Pikmin are checking collisions with 99 Pikmin, several enemies, 20+ lines, and a lot more
2013-10-29 20:32:27	Espyo	enum{ KEY_A, KEY_B, KEY_C, ...}
2013-10-29 20:32:32	Espyo	I know KEY_A is 0
2013-10-29 20:32:41	Espyo	but I don't know that 0 is called "KEY_A" in some enum
2013-10-29 20:33:21	@J	you don't need that
2013-10-29 20:33:30	@J	if KEY_A is in the file, you just want to go from that to 0
2013-10-29 20:34:19	Espyo	what then?
2013-10-29 20:41:22	@J	then you have 0
2013-10-29 20:41:33	@J	which is what you wanted, isn't it?
2013-10-29 20:41:39	<--	ChanServ (chanserv@services.darkmyst.org) has quit (*.net *.split)
2013-10-29 20:42:41	Espyo	uh...
2013-10-29 20:42:44	Espyo	ok, let's start from the top
2013-10-29 20:42:52	Espyo	Allegro has an enum
2013-10-29 20:42:57	Espyo	with all the keys' numbers
2013-10-29 20:43:06	Espyo	ALLEGRO_KEY_A, ALLEGRO_KEY_B, etc.
2013-10-29 20:43:16	Espyo	ALLEGRO_KEY_A is a 0
2013-10-29 20:43:30	Espyo	however, in the options file, I can't have "ALLEGRO_KEY_A"
2013-10-29 20:43:38	Espyo	because I have absolutely no way to transform that into a 0 at runtime
2013-10-29 20:43:50	Espyo	(actually the A key is 1, but whatever)
2013-10-29 20:46:35	Espyo	well, besides the key names thing, I'm ready to push
2013-10-29 20:46:40	Espyo	or rather, commit
2013-10-29 20:47:14	@J	yes
2013-10-29 20:47:29	@J	C++ has some sort of hashmap-type data structures, doesn't it?
2013-10-29 20:47:42	@J	can't you create one of those from an enum and use that?
2013-10-29 20:48:00	Espyo	a map, yes
2013-10-29 20:48:16	Espyo	there's no need, there's another thing I can do
2013-10-29 20:48:25	Espyo	when a key is pressed, I can obtain its English name
2013-10-29 20:48:30	Espyo	it's a thing Allegro has
2013-10-29 20:48:38	Espyo	nothing related to enums or anything, just an Allegro feature
2013-10-29 20:48:48	Espyo	and I guess I can compare that to the name the user wrote on the options file
2013-10-29 20:48:56	Espyo	but this is where the whole "what if there are spaces" thing arises
2013-10-29 20:49:20	@J	you didn't add some files to git
2013-10-29 20:49:27	Espyo	well, either way, in the future, these options will be editable in-game
2013-10-29 20:49:37	Espyo	no need to edit the text file and blindly guess values
2013-10-29 20:49:44	@J	onion, nectar, info_spot?
2013-10-29 20:49:51	@J	ship
2013-10-29 20:49:54	Espyo	...I didn't?
2013-10-29 20:50:07	@J	header files
2013-10-29 20:50:17	@J	and the .cpp
2013-10-29 20:50:39	Espyo	git status doesn't tell me those files need to be staged
2013-10-29 20:50:57	Espyo	they were staged, committed and pulled when they should've then
2013-10-29 20:50:59	@J	well, they're in spec_objs, whatever that s
2013-10-29 20:50:59	Espyo	how weird
2013-10-29 20:51:06	@J	wait, maybe they're meant to be in there?
2013-10-29 20:51:07	Espyo	but they're meant to be there
2013-10-29 20:51:08	@J	*is
2013-10-29 20:51:08	@J	oh
2013-10-29 20:51:11	Espyo	special objects
2013-10-29 20:51:17	Espyo	trying to keep things a bit more organized
2013-10-29 20:51:17	@J	probably just need to fix the makefile, then
2013-10-29 20:51:21	Espyo	ah, yes
2013-10-29 20:51:49	Espyo	anyway, don't tire yourself out, I'll push the controls/options/things version soon

2013-10-29 20:51:51	@J	I'm not sure how you normally do a makefile for multi-directory code
2013-10-29 20:51:58	@J	...I already did it
2013-10-29 20:52:03	Espyo	*shrug*
2013-10-29 20:52:09	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-29 20:52:15	Espyo	shouldn't *.cpp be enough?
2013-10-29 20:52:36	Espyo	./main.cpp and ./spec_objs/onion.cpp both follow that pattern
2013-10-29 20:53:32	@J	no, * doesn't glob over directories
2013-10-29 20:53:41	Espyo	there must be an easy way
2013-10-29 20:53:56	Espyo	I'm not sure if I should send my Options.txt too
2013-10-29 20:54:00	@J	yes
2013-10-29 20:54:09	Espyo	because next time someone pulls, it'll replace their Options.txt
2013-10-29 20:54:23	Espyo	however if I don't send it, you'll never know what the file is meant to be like
2013-10-29 20:54:29	@J	no, Git will say it needs to be merged
2013-10-29 20:55:16	@J	also, files with settings in should probably be overriden by files in user directories
2013-10-29 20:55:21	@J	on Windows, %appdata%
2013-10-29 20:55:47	Espyo	but all my settings files are on the same folder as the game
2013-10-29 20:55:56	Espyo	because appdata folders are a /nightmare/
2013-10-29 20:56:03	Espyo	not to mention that they're different on every OS
2013-10-29 20:57:59	Espyo	I should make the game create an Options.txt, if it can't find it
2013-10-29 20:58:04	Espyo	which is what I do in other games
2013-10-29 20:58:17	Espyo	sure, git users will be asked if they want to merge
2013-10-29 20:58:36	Espyo	even though they could still accidentally overwrite it
2013-10-29 20:58:51	@J	what if the game is installed somewhere the user doesn't have write permissions?
2013-10-29 20:58:58	Espyo	but other users will download a new version, unzip the file, dump it in order to replace everything, and boom goes the file
2013-10-29 20:59:13	Espyo	it won't be installed
2013-10-29 20:59:16	Espyo	not a friend of installers
2013-10-29 20:59:23	Espyo	if you want the game, just unzip it wherever you like
2013-10-29 20:59:27	@J	someone might want to make an installer for their game
2013-10-29 20:59:36	Espyo	that's their problem
2013-10-29 20:59:54	Espyo	if they want to go as complex as having an installer
2013-10-29 20:59:54	@J	well, I don't see why you don't support it
2013-10-29 20:59:56	@J	it's pretty easy
2013-10-29 21:00:10	Espyo	then they can probably afford time to program option files and save files outside the game's directory
2013-10-29 21:00:14	Espyo	but it's not pretty easy!
2013-10-29 21:00:16	Espyo	at /all/
2013-10-29 21:00:25	Espyo	wait, you mean an installer?
2013-10-29 21:00:29	Espyo	installers aren't that easy either
2013-10-29 21:00:35	@J	no, I didn't
2013-10-29 21:00:40	@J	but they can be easy too
2013-10-29 21:00:58	Espyo	there's that wizard for installers, but that doesn't matter
2013-10-29 21:01:10	Espyo	what matters is that on windows, finding out where %appdata% is and making good use of it is chaotic
2013-10-29 21:01:22	Espyo	and that's just windows
2013-10-29 21:01:27	Espyo	what'd I do for the other OSes?
2013-10-29 21:01:55	Espyo	leaving it on the game's folder just fixes everything: if you don't have write access to that folder, than you couldn't even place the game there to begin with
2013-10-29 21:02:20	Espyo	you could argue that if I want to format but save my save files, I could just save %appdata%, but unfortunately that's moot
2013-10-29 21:02:24	@J	if you're really that lazy, you can just use ~/.config everywhere
2013-10-29 21:02:26	Espyo	half of my games install on %appdata%
2013-10-29 21:02:47	Espyo	*have the save data on %appdata%
2013-10-29 21:02:56	Espyo	*half of my installed games
2013-10-29 21:02:57	Espyo	...
2013-10-29 21:03:03	@J	[21:01:55] Espyo leaving it on the game's folder just fixes everything: if you don't have write
2013-10-29 21:03:03	@J	access to that folder, than you couldn't even place the game there to begin with
2013-10-29 21:03:06	Espyo	some have it on the game's folder, some have it on my documents, some on my user's folder
2013-10-29 21:03:12	Espyo	some have it on who knows where!
2013-10-29 21:03:14	@J	obviously you request elevated permissions when installing
2013-10-29 21:03:21	Espyo	no installing, remember?
2013-10-29 21:03:40	Espyo	also I'm very sure windows would probably give up and bsod if you told it "~/.config" is a directory
2013-10-29 21:03:45	@J	when 'manually installing'
2013-10-29 21:04:01	Espyo	when does that happen other than in a school environment?
2013-10-29 21:04:06	@J	by ~, I mean $HOME or whatever you want to call it
2013-10-29 21:04:06	Espyo	besides, just use it on the desktop
2013-10-29 21:04:24	Espyo	but that still has the problem of being OS-dependant
2013-10-29 21:05:07	Espyo	OSX might have some "parseDir(/home/* ?d)" or whatever
2013-10-29 21:05:07	@J	my code for this is 17 lines
2013-10-29 21:05:12	Espyo	don't even know how OSX works
2013-10-29 21:05:18	Espyo	 17 Python lines
2013-10-29 21:05:53	@J	most of it is work to call some low-level code that doesn't have a nice Python interface
2013-10-29 21:06:15	@J	that's 14 lines on Windows, 1 line for everything else
2013-10-29 21:06:31	Espyo	see, we need to go to the depths of the operative system just to place a file on a place that doesn't even matter much
2013-10-29 21:06:45	@J	and it's only 14 lines on Windows to fully support UTF-8
2013-10-29 21:06:46	Espyo	I /really/ don't wanna do it
2013-10-29 21:06:52	@J	skip that and it's 1 line
2013-10-29 21:06:54	Espyo	ah, yes, and there's also that windows problem
2013-10-29 21:06:59	Espyo	ugh
2013-10-29 21:07:04	Espyo	and I can just see it fail in thousands of ways
2013-10-29 21:07:09	Espyo	oh boy, can I ever
2013-10-29 21:07:31	@J	well, whatever, it's just one of those things that really annoys me
2013-10-29 21:07:36	Espyo	this is one of those things that should be universal by now, but still isn't
2013-10-29 21:07:39	@J	applications that don't follow conventions
2013-10-29 21:07:50	Espyo	...then you have to complain about a lot of applications
2013-10-29 21:07:59	@J	only on Windows
2013-10-29 21:08:08	Espyo	 21:02	Espyo	half of my games install on %appdata%
2013-10-29 21:08:09	Espyo	 21:03	Espyo	some have it on the game's folder, some have it on my documents, some on my user's folder
2013-10-29 21:08:12	Espyo	 21:03	Espyo	some have it on who knows where!
2013-10-29 21:08:32	Espyo	configuration and game save files don't have a universal place at the moment
2013-10-29 21:08:46	@J	mm, true, games are pretty silly even here
2013-10-29 21:08:59	Espyo	it's one of those things that should really really be universal
2013-10-29 21:09:16	Espyo	but for now, I don't think I can really be shunned for not following a convention that doesn't exist yet
2013-10-29 21:09:17	@J	some are ~/.config/game/, some ~/.config/engine/developer/game, some ~/.developer/game
2013-10-29 21:09:28	Espyo	might as well take the safest and least troublesome path, which is just the game's folder
2013-10-29 21:09:37	Espyo	if you have the game somewhere, chances are you can have the file there as well
2013-10-29 21:09:40	Espyo	so it's for the best
2013-10-29 21:09:51	Espyo	oh!
2013-10-29 21:09:54	Espyo	I almost forgot!
2013-10-29 21:09:59	Espyo	some save stuff on the /registry/
2013-10-29 21:16:44	Espyo	got dinner now
2013-10-29 21:16:59	Espyo	I'll push after I write the code to save the options if they don't exist
2013-10-29 21:50:42	@J	oh, BTW
2013-10-29 21:50:43	@J	http://sprunge.us/TQFZ
2013-10-29 21:51:16	Espyo	so basically, just replace the previous SRCS with SRCS := $(shell find Source/ -name '*.cpp')
2013-10-29 21:51:29	Espyo	last time I tried applying a diff, I had to do a lot of things
2013-10-29 21:51:36	Espyo	a lot of confusing, long things
2013-10-29 21:52:50	@J	yes, that's it

2013-10-29 22:26:05	Espyo	but that one spans over 200 videos
2013-10-29 22:26:10	Espyo	longer than 10 minutes
2013-10-29 23:10:10	Espyo	done, pushed
2013-10-29 23:10:17	Espyo	now I should probably study physics

2013-10-31 19:07:16	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2013-10-31 19:07:44	Espyo	Testyo: story
2013-10-31 19:07:48	Espyo	good
2013-10-31 19:15:11	@J	hi
2013-10-31 19:16:14	Espyo	hi
2013-10-31 19:16:47	Espyo	today I dreamed I was playing Pikmin 3
2013-10-31 19:17:12	Espyo	it was a Forest of Hope type area, and our base was on top of a tree stump, precariously placed near a pond
2013-10-31 19:17:28	Espyo	although for some reason, Pikmin carrying treasure were carrying it towards somewhere far away from the base, but eh
2013-10-31 19:18:00	Espyo	I mostly remember the end, where there was a Wollywog (but faster and larger) and an Emperor Bulblax going for the Pikmin at the base
2013-10-31 19:18:09	Espyo	and I was luring them out as Olimar
2013-10-31 19:18:12	Espyo	here's the catch...
2013-10-31 19:18:24	Espyo	the Emperor looked like this creature http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article197211.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/blobfish-pic-caters-771402167-197211.jpg
2013-10-31 19:18:54	Espyo	at one point, I was so pissed off that they kept turning back and insisting on attacking my Pikmin, that I grew to normal size, so the enemies reached just around my ankles
2013-10-31 19:19:10	Espyo	I was going to kick the "Emperor Bulblax" hard, and with a satisfying kick
2013-10-31 19:19:15	Espyo	but I was jolted awake by the alarm clock
2013-10-31 19:19:38	Espyo	on a completely unrelated note, I now know what type of enemies to create for the engine, blob-fish-looking Emperor Bulblaxes
2013-10-31 19:36:17	@J	ooh, got distracted
2013-10-31 19:36:22	@J	I'll read when I get back from eating
2013-10-31 19:51:01	@J	that would be amazing
2013-10-31 19:51:44	@J	both a creature looking like that, and increasing in size and/or flying to see what the world looks like from a normal viewpoint
2013-10-31 19:52:03	Espyo	hmm, yeah
2013-10-31 19:52:08	Espyo	I guess I'll just zoom out by 100
2013-10-31 19:52:18	Espyo	and as for the creature, guess that could be arranged
2013-10-31 19:55:18	Espyo	oh boy, C++'s doing its thing again
2013-10-31 19:55:27	Espyo	all mobs can be carried
2013-10-31 19:55:47	Espyo	and when the Pikmin decide on an Onion, that should be saved somewhere
2013-10-31 19:56:07	Espyo	so I want an attribute inside mob that's the chosen Pikmin type
2013-10-31 19:56:16	Espyo	the problem is that Pikmin type ‚Äî
2013-10-31 19:56:18	Espyo	wait a minute, no it's not
2013-10-31 19:56:39	Espyo	I was going to say Pikmin type is a mob
2013-10-31 19:56:42	Espyo	inherits from mob
2013-10-31 19:56:45	Espyo	but that's not true
2013-10-31 19:56:53	Espyo	well, if it was, I would have no way to do it, but to hack around it
2013-10-31 19:57:52	@J	oh, I wasn't even thinking of your engine when I said that
2013-10-31 19:58:07	-->	Gamefreak75 (Fassad@gje-23-80-243-717.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #pikipedia
2013-10-31 19:58:09	Espyo	I figured
2013-10-31 19:58:18	Espyo	but there's no use in discussing a hypothetical Pikmin hack because that can't be done
2013-10-31 19:58:20	Espyo	...kinda
2013-10-31 19:58:28	Espyo	oh, free view on Dolphin
2013-10-31 19:58:36	Espyo	now we just need an Emperor Blobfish
2013-10-31 19:58:55	@J	surely that's something the game creator makes, not you?
2013-10-31 20:00:42	Espyo	what, exactly?
2013-10-31 20:01:41	Espyo	...and visual studio insists that a mob's carrying info has no "decided_type" attribute
2013-10-31 20:01:47	Espyo	even though it compiled just fine and everything is working fine
2013-10-31 20:07:50	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Clean_it_up
2013-10-31 20:07:53	Espyo	bossy category name
2013-10-31 20:08:23	@J	do it
2013-10-31 20:08:25	@J	do it now
2013-10-31 20:08:36	Espyo	clean it!
2013-10-31 20:08:44	Espyo	and do it skyward
2013-10-31 20:09:06	Espyo	wah!
2013-10-31 20:09:11	Espyo	well, that was lucky
2013-10-31 20:09:22	Espyo	I just so happened to notice the category name
2013-10-31 20:09:38	Espyo	and I just so happened to check [[Hole of Heroes]] to see what was so ugly about it
2013-10-31 20:09:47	Espyo	and I stumbled across this image 
2013-10-31 20:09:49	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/3/3d/Hole_of_Heroes_sublevel_6.jpg
2013-10-31 20:10:06	Espyo	what's so special about this is that this is /very/ likely the section of the game that originated the tree stump base on my dream
2013-10-31 20:10:20	Espyo	it's on a tree stump, it's precarious, and it's surrounded by a pond
2013-10-31 20:10:24	@J	heh
2013-10-31 20:10:42	Espyo	that section of the game was pretty defining for me
2013-10-31 20:10:45	Espyo	if... that's the word I want
2013-10-31 20:10:52	Espyo	but yeah, I remember that part really well
2013-10-31 20:11:06	Espyo	the careful travelling, the waiting for minutes on end thinking of what to do
2013-10-31 20:11:14	Espyo	...oh, and there are Water Dumples that can reach you
2013-10-31 20:11:21	Espyo	that and Wollywogs
2013-10-31 20:11:25	Espyo	this sublevel's just a bundle of joy
2013-10-31 20:11:33	Espyo	no wonder it had such an impact that I would dream of it years later
2013-10-31 20:11:43	@J	hmm, yeah, I remember the random water levels in the large caves well for some reason
2013-10-31 20:12:02	Espyo	must be because of those things
2013-10-31 20:12:08	Espyo	ugh, specially on no-death runs
2013-10-31 20:13:42	Espyo	this is going to need some thought put into it
2013-10-31 20:14:12	Espyo	ok, one of the ways carrying works is that if there's a tie in the majority types
2013-10-31 20:14:18	Espyo	an Onion will be picked at random
2013-10-31 20:14:41	Espyo	and this choice will only be re-decided if a tie-breaking Pikmin is added
2013-10-31 20:15:11	Espyo	otherwise, you can throw a Purple/White, throw a Pikmin that doesn't make a new majority, remove, etc., and the decision will not change
2013-10-31 20:15:44	Espyo	now, in my code, when it's time to decide, I first figure out what the majority types are (of those that count, so no Purples/Whites)
2013-10-31 20:15:52	Espyo	but then what?
2013-10-31 20:16:24	Espyo	not really sure what to do to prevent the Pikmin from re-choosing an Onion if no tie is broken
2013-10-31 20:16:33	Espyo	not really sure how to check if no ties are broken to begin with
2013-10-31 20:16:40	Espyo	this is kinda simple, but for some reason, I'm not feeling it
2013-10-31 20:16:44	Espyo	maybe it's because I have food in my mind
2013-10-31 20:17:07	Espyo	and also I wanna commit really badly, I changed a lot of important stuff in the code, and I wanna have a commit point in case of trouble
2013-10-31 20:17:40	Espyo	I'll just draw some doodles to understand the scenarios better
2013-10-31 20:22:02	Espyo	ok, when a tie exists, just keep going for the previously chosen Onion
2013-10-31 20:22:17	Espyo	but if a new tie is introduced, I have no way of knowing it's new
2013-10-31 20:22:20	Espyo	hmmmmmm
2013-10-31 20:22:30	Espyo	I'll have to save what the new Pikmin is
2013-10-31 20:48:51	Espyo	so I was trying to understand why a White Pikmin kept choosing Blue as its destination Onion
2013-10-31 20:49:02	Espyo	I issued it to the pellet like 10 times and it always picked blue
2013-10-31 20:49:08	Espyo	when I debugged, it picked Red
2013-10-31 20:49:13	Espyo	...I am so lucky
2013-10-31 20:49:46	Espyo	oh, ok, it's not quite like that
2013-10-31 20:49:55	Espyo	it just doesn't choose again
2013-10-31 20:53:34	Espyo	pfft, GitHub has a "Zen Mode" for when you're writing a new issue
2013-10-31 20:54:45	Espyo	oh, can you test something /real/ quick?
2013-10-31 20:54:52	Espyo	I have a hunch on what the zoom out problem might be
2013-10-31 20:55:16	Espyo	with the latest commit (the one that added the options file, not this one that I'm committing in a few minutes)
2013-10-31 20:55:24	Espyo	change the options file to disable smooth scaling
2013-10-31 20:56:24	Espyo	I think that I made it so that it also enables mipmapping
2013-10-31 20:56:47	Espyo	and the background just so happens to be the only thing that has a texture that's square, and with dimensions that are powers of 2
2013-10-31 20:56:50	Espyo	so /maybe/...
2013-10-31 21:09:19	@J	there isn't an options file in there
2013-10-31 21:09:27	Espyo	it's generated once you run
2013-10-31 21:09:33	@J	oh
2013-10-31 21:11:00	Espyo	if that doesn't fix the glitch, try disabling the daylight effect
2013-10-31 21:12:00	@J	disabling smooth scaling fixed it
2013-10-31 21:12:37	Espyo	hah!
2013-10-31 21:12:45	Espyo	we've found the root of the problem!
2013-10-31 21:12:52	Espyo	it has to do with how Linux does mipmapping
2013-10-31 21:12:54	Espyo	at least on Allegro
2013-10-31 21:13:15	Espyo	do you have anything else that can use mipmapping?
2013-10-31 21:16:31	@J	Minecraft with Optifine
2013-10-31 21:16:43	@J	I guess it depends how it's done, though
2013-10-31 21:17:12	@J	any idea what the Allegro key code for comma is?
2013-10-31 21:17:24	Espyo	I'll give you it
2013-10-31 21:17:30	Espyo	I suppose it's on the same spot as my comma
2013-10-31 21:17:58	Espyo	unrelated: I just found out that that unused texture in Brawl's version of Earth is not unused
2013-10-31 21:18:23	Espyo	do you still have that test program where you press up and down to scale an image?
2013-10-31 21:18:34	Espyo	and my comma is 72
2013-10-31 21:18:46	@J	[21:18:23] Espyo do you still have that test program where you press up and down to scale an image?
2013-10-31 21:18:47	@J	no
2013-10-31 21:19:00	@J	72 works
2013-10-31 21:19:02	Espyo	I might still have it
2013-10-31 21:19:23	Espyo	...
2013-10-31 21:19:28	Espyo	it's exactly the program I'm using
2013-10-31 21:19:40	Espyo	I just re-used it to make it also tell me what code a pressed key has
2013-10-31 21:23:25	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/0YYuMXea
2013-10-31 21:23:29	Espyo	please compile this
2013-10-31 21:23:39	Espyo	same rules: bmp.png on the program's directory, press up and down to scale
2013-10-31 21:23:48	Espyo	if you press down, and all goes well, it should become darker
2013-10-31 21:24:02	Espyo	oh, and the bitmap has to be square, and have dimensions in the powers of 2
2013-10-31 21:24:34	Espyo	if this is it, it's over
2013-10-31 21:24:46	Espyo	I'll just have to post it on the forums, someone who knows what they're doing can fix it, and soon, all will be fixed
2013-10-31 21:25:27	@J	BRB
2013-10-31 21:26:17	Espyo	ditto
2013-10-31 21:34:32	@J	it doesn't become darker
2013-10-31 21:34:50	@J	doesn't look like it's smooth scaling
2013-10-31 21:35:13	@J	http://i.imgur.com/CEHnJ16.png
2013-10-31 21:35:14	@J	the image
2013-10-31 21:48:48	Espyo	hmm
2013-10-31 21:49:07	Espyo	oh
2013-10-31 21:49:16	Espyo	that's because I think MIN_FILTER needs to be applied to
2013-10-31 21:49:20	Espyo	and maybe MAG as wel
2013-10-31 21:49:22	Espyo	*well
2013-10-31 21:49:57	Espyo	ok, on line 19, add "| ALLEGRO_MIN_LINEAR | ALLEGRO_MAG_LINEAR"
2013-10-31 21:54:53	@J	smooth scaling, no darkening
2013-10-31 21:56:14	Espyo	...
2013-10-31 21:56:20	Espyo	drat, this isn't it either
2013-10-31 21:56:25	Espyo	but it's certainly closer
2013-10-31 21:56:33	Espyo	let's see what else I disable with smooth_scrolling set to false
2013-10-31 21:57:03	Espyo	*scaling
2013-10-31 21:57:26	Espyo	nope, nothing else
2013-10-31 21:57:27	Espyo	how bizarre
2013-10-31 21:57:42	Espyo	guess I'll strip more and more of it until I reach a conclusion
2013-10-31 21:57:46	@J	yeah
2013-10-31 21:57:48	Espyo	but this was certainly a good discovery
2013-10-31 21:57:56	@J	you know, you can test this in the VM I gave you
2013-10-31 21:58:06	Espyo	yes, but I was doing something
2013-10-31 21:58:08	Espyo	that's why I asked
2013-10-31 21:58:18	Espyo	thanks
2013-10-31 21:58:57	@J	okay, just checking you hadn't gone crazy and not realised
2013-10-31 21:58:58	Espyo	and now I need to draw a 10-pellet just to test Onion choosing behavior

2013-11-02 17:58:58	Testyo	Oh, PikFan, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 27/10/2013 17:27 (GMT), saying: that weird WW sunset variation happens whether you enter a cave or not.
2013-11-02 17:59:28	Espyo	yeah, it's all written down on [[Music]]
2013-11-02 18:00:01	@PikFan	yeah, I saw your... uh, let's say /enormous/ edit
2013-11-02 18:00:30	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-02 18:01:04	@PikFan	so, I'm playing Cookie Clicker
2013-11-02 18:01:18	Espyo	ditto
2013-11-02 18:01:19	@PikFan	and I have baked nearly 600,000,000,000 cookies total
2013-11-02 18:01:42	Espyo	I have 3,962,624,578,652,757 right now
2013-11-02 18:01:55	@PikFan	._.
2013-11-02 18:02:06	Espyo	if you're that high, that means you activated the grandmapocalypse by now, I reckon
2013-11-02 18:02:14	@PikFan	nope
2013-11-02 18:02:23	Espyo	should be close then
2013-11-02 18:02:26	@PikFan	still have to buy all the upgrades to get to it
2013-11-02 18:02:46	Espyo	oh, and I have almost every update
2013-11-02 18:02:47	@PikFan	I haven't even bought the underworld ovens upgrade yet
2013-11-02 18:02:56	Espyo	you need to do some things for some updates to appear, and I can't get those right now
2013-11-02 18:03:04	Espyo	but currently, I'm just letting the cookie count increase
2013-11-02 18:03:06	Espyo	nothing left to buy
2013-11-02 18:03:12	Espyo	hm, except more buildings
2013-11-02 18:03:22	@PikFan	do you have all achievements ‚Äî okay
2013-11-02 18:03:41	@PikFan	going to be a while before I can get 200 cursors
2013-11-02 18:03:50	@PikFan	much less 240
2013-11-02 18:04:07	Espyo	all but 1
2013-11-02 18:04:14	Espyo	you don't need more than 200
2013-11-02 18:04:15	Espyo	...do you?
2013-11-02 18:04:41	@PikFan	well I just want to get all achievements
2013-11-02 18:04:51	Espyo	but there isn't any achievement for 240 cursors
2013-11-02 18:05:06	@PikFan	I know, but there's an upgrade for 240 cursors
2013-11-02 18:05:14	Espyo	...oh
2013-11-02 18:05:19	Espyo	in that case, I'm missing that one
2013-11-02 18:05:24	@PikFan	heh
2013-11-02 18:05:51	@PikFan	and I'm angry at myself, because I've been looking over the cookie clicker wiki
2013-11-02 18:05:56	@PikFan	which is a wikia
2013-11-02 18:05:58	@PikFan	unfortunately
2013-11-02 18:06:20	@PikFan	but I've been using the ?useskin=monobook thing at the end of the URLs, so it's fine
2013-11-02 18:06:52	@PikFan	hmm
2013-11-02 18:07:18	@PikFan	should buy another AC, only have... what... 8, of those?
2013-11-02 18:07:20	Espyo	I checked some articles as well
2013-11-02 18:07:28	Espyo	ACs are very powerful
2013-11-02 18:07:31	Espyo	specially when you upgrade them
2013-11-02 18:07:39	Espyo	basically, on every AC upgrade, you see your CpS nearly double
2013-11-02 18:07:56	@PikFan	yeah
2013-11-02 18:08:04	@PikFan	just bought two more
2013-11-02 18:09:19	@PikFan	so now my CpS is 31,868,818.8
2013-11-02 18:10:57	@PikFan	er, now it's 32,699,567
2013-11-02 18:11:07	@PikFan	because I bought two more time machines
2013-11-02 18:19:20	@PikFan	oh, another thing
2013-11-02 18:19:37	@PikFan	I managed to get the True Neverclick shadow achievement
2013-11-02 18:19:52	@PikFan	it was testing my patience, though
2013-11-02 18:23:26	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-02 18:23:35	Espyo	so you got neverclick as well
2013-11-02 18:23:45	Espyo	that's the one I'm missing
2013-11-02 18:23:50	Espyo	not really going for the shadow ones
2013-11-02 18:24:08	@PikFan	mm
2013-11-02 18:24:13	@PikFan	I can see why
2013-11-02 18:24:30	@PikFan	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh
2013-11-02 18:24:35	@PikFan	I hate you wikia
2013-11-02 18:24:55	@PikFan	it's not letting me view pages
2013-11-02 18:25:14	@PikFan	instead I get a page called "Connect account with Facebook"
2013-11-02 18:25:17	Espyo	...typical
2013-11-02 18:25:54	@PikFan	okay, I guess this is for EVERY wikia
2013-11-02 18:26:11	@PikFan	tried viewing a Pikmin Wikia article, got the same page
2013-11-02 18:27:23	@PikFan	wikia is so corrupt
2013-11-02 18:27:32	@PikFan	I dream of the day when wikia will fall
2013-11-02 18:29:13	@PikFan	anyway, wiki-related, I see that you've been uploading the treasure textures for the Treasure Hoard
2013-11-02 18:30:32	@PikFan	oh, Piklopedia too?
2013-11-02 18:31:17	Espyo	mhm
2013-11-02 18:31:24	Espyo	Piklopedia's looking great
2013-11-02 18:31:31	Espyo	but I'm only 3/4 of the way there for Treasure Hoard
2013-11-02 18:31:35	Espyo	it's /very/ complex
2013-11-02 18:32:39	@PikFan	I'll bet, I saw the source code in the upload summaries
2013-11-02 18:33:11	@PikFan	...that's not even half of it is it
2013-11-02 18:34:36	Espyo	all US textures are uploaded
2013-11-02 18:34:49	Espyo	but wrapping my mind over icons that have different names in PAL
2013-11-02 18:34:53	Espyo	or different treasures but similar names
2013-11-02 18:34:57	@PikFan	yeah
2013-11-02 18:34:58	Espyo	it's hectic
2013-11-02 18:35:10	@PikFan	blame cultural differences, I suppose
2013-11-02 18:35:16	Espyo	yes
2013-11-02 18:35:25	Espyo	but at least they're justified here, so I'm not upset
2013-11-02 18:35:29	@PikFan	right
2013-11-02 18:35:33	Espyo	there are games that have massive regional differences for no reason
2013-11-02 18:35:47	Espyo	I'm not even uploading the Japan icons so far
2013-11-02 18:35:49	Espyo	to try to keep it simple

2013-11-03 13:04:23	Espyo	also, in case you didn't spot it amidst my thousands of edits, Prez posted this http://www.pikminwiki.com/Talk:HP
2013-11-03 13:07:50	@J	makes it not show up on the template
2013-11-03 13:08:13	@J	I think we had that discussion before and most people said health
2013-11-03 13:08:16	Espyo	yeah, but were they showing up?
2013-11-03 13:08:20	@J	...or, at least I did
2013-11-03 13:08:26	Espyo	heh
2013-11-03 13:08:31	@J	no, just blank space was showing up and it looked silly
2013-11-03 13:08:37	Espyo	well, I think I used "HP" because it's what [[Piklopedia]] linked to
2013-11-03 13:08:42	Espyo	oh, so that's what that was
2013-11-03 13:08:55	Espyo	hm, but that blank space will appear in the pages regardless
2013-11-03 13:09:05	Espyo	if we could get rid of it outright...
2013-11-03 13:09:18	Espyo	blame MediaWiki's template conditional things
2013-11-03 13:10:43	@J	well, does it appear in the pages?
2013-11-03 13:10:57	@J	doesn't look like it
2013-11-03 13:11:04	Espyo	I think so
2013-11-03 13:11:10	Espyo	it doesn't make sense for it to not appear
2013-11-03 13:11:19	Espyo	except on the ones that actually do use an image or video
2013-11-03 13:11:22	@J	oh, it does when you have an image/video
2013-11-03 13:11:23	@J	yeah...
2013-11-03 13:11:38	@J	just remove the blank line, I think
2013-11-03 13:11:47	@J	and put the conditionals on the same line
2013-11-03 13:12:20	@J	yep, fixed
2013-11-03 13:13:13	Espyo	won't they break if...
2013-11-03 13:13:19	Espyo	hm, if it has both an image and a video
2013-11-03 13:13:28	Espyo	but I realized that that doesn't really happen
2013-11-03 13:14:02	Espyo	on that note, I'm starting to wonder if having so many videos on a single page would be a good idea
2013-11-03 13:29:36	@J	I don't think it will break even if it does
2013-11-03 13:29:46	@J	yeah, don't really notice it here because of FlashBlock, but...
2013-11-03 13:29:51	@J	could make it take a while to load
2013-11-03 13:30:05	Espyo	yeah, it would be slow
2013-11-03 13:30:14	Espyo	although I guess it only really fetches the thumbnail and video metadata
2013-11-03 13:30:27	Espyo	maybe the actual flash player is the heaviest thing
2013-11-03 13:30:30	@J	still instantiates a load of flash video playres
2013-11-03 13:30:35	@J	*players
2013-11-03 13:31:25	Espyo	yeah
2013-11-03 13:33:52	@J	any reason you used an old license?

2013-11-03 13:44:40	Espyo	lunch
2013-11-03 14:49:22	Espyo	oh, I was going to create the Treasure Hoard icon categories
2013-11-03 14:49:29	Espyo	but I can see you already did exactly what I was planning on doing
2013-11-03 16:45:42	@J	finally removed those files from 'category:pikmin 1/2'
2013-11-03 16:48:12	@J	so I just went to the Google Docs todo list thing
2013-11-03 16:48:21	@J	I wasn't logged in, but it let me resolve a conversation
2013-11-03 16:55:25	Espyo	why did an ano‚Äî
2013-11-03 16:55:26	Espyo	oh
2013-11-03 17:00:46	@J	heh, I just got an email about it too
2013-11-03 17:01:27	Espyo	mhm
2013-11-03 17:03:20	@J	so you might be beating me just a little bit on number of completed items
2013-11-03 17:05:39	Espyo	maybe
2013-11-03 17:29:56	@J	regarding category:eating enemies - it just seems kind of odd to group the ones that eat stuff together when there are so many of them
2013-11-03 17:30:52	@J	I don't know, I guess it makes sense to have it to complete the set of hazards posed by enemies
2013-11-03 17:31:35	@J	it's like have a category for enemies that stay on the ground, since we have one for airborne enemies
2013-11-03 17:32:17	Espyo	yeah, exactly
2013-11-03 17:32:23	Espyo	it's only for complementing
2013-11-03 17:32:38	Espyo	besides, it could always come in handy
2013-11-03 17:32:46	Espyo	might come in handy for me when it's time to code enemy AI on the engine

2013-11-03 18:54:19	Prezintenden	crazy. google images gives kuchen that look exactly like the game ones, but I've never seen any that look like that, only way taller ones. crazy crazy

2013-11-03 19:05:28	Testyo	Oh, PikFan, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 03/11/2013 01:50 (GMT), saying: got good news for you.
2013-11-03 19:05:40	@PikFan	hmm?
2013-11-03 19:06:22	Espyo	I noticed all of the treasure names
2013-11-03 19:06:30	Espyo	because of my Treasure Hoard icon uploads
2013-11-03 19:06:37	Espyo	and I'm currently completing the /Icon comparisons subpage
2013-11-03 19:06:51	Espyo	but don't really see what's so special about the confection hoop and pastry wheel
2013-11-03 19:07:10	@PikFan	heh, are there problems with those treasures?
2013-11-03 19:07:14	Espyo	PikFan: just talking to Prez
2013-11-03 19:07:21	@PikFan	oh
2013-11-03 19:07:27	Espyo	also, I've been editing the Treasure Hoard page lately, as you might've noticed
2013-11-03 19:07:36	Espyo	then, I figured I'd take a look at wikia's equivalent
2013-11-03 19:07:41	Espyo	go check it out
2013-11-03 19:07:45	Prezintenden	hoop was still described as donut even though it's a baumkuchen. it's nothing big, i just had a "wow" moment when i realised what they actually were
2013-11-03 19:07:46	Espyo	both our Treasure Hoard page and theirs
2013-11-03 19:07:54	Espyo	ah
2013-11-03 19:11:45	Prezintenden	wikia's looks less orderly, but i like how the series are seperated kinda...
2013-11-03 19:12:24	Espyo	I like it as well, actually
2013-11-03 19:12:30	Espyo	that's the /only/ positive point about that page
2013-11-03 19:12:31	Espyo	other than that
2013-11-03 19:12:51	Espyo	no icons, that page is in like 30 categories, it has a random "|}" at the end that nobody fixed
2013-11-03 19:12:59	Espyo	so yeah, Treasure Hoard page
2013-11-03 19:13:04	Espyo	something that's meant to be important
2013-11-03 19:13:15	Espyo	with all of this, PikFan, I'm trying to tell you that you have nothing to worry about
2013-11-03 19:13:24	@PikFan	I see
2013-11-03 19:13:25	Espyo	our wiki lacks Pikmin 3 content, but that's the only flaw

2013-11-03 19:13:54	@PikFan	11:13	Espyo	our wiki lacks Pikmin 3 content, but that's the only flaw
2013-11-03 19:13:57	Espyo	pfft hah
2013-11-03 19:14:01	@PikFan	yeah, a gigantic flaw
2013-11-03 19:14:06	Espyo	also that title is incorrect, it's "Empty space container"
2013-11-03 19:14:07	Espyo	idiots
2013-11-03 19:14:14	@PikFan	it's like 1/3 of the wiki is missing
2013-11-03 19:14:15	Espyo	well yeah, it's gigantic, but remember that it's only temporary
2013-11-03 19:14:18	Espyo	yes
2013-11-03 19:14:20	@PikFan	right
2013-11-03 19:14:23	Espyo	but I'm not in a hurry
2013-11-03 19:14:59	Prezintenden	if uni math wasn't destroying MY ass i might do more
2013-11-03 19:15:22	Prezintenden	ugh. i think i might have picked the wrong subject
2013-11-03 19:18:56	Espyo	same

2013-11-03 19:54:24	@J	but now he'll just grab my quoting you

2013-11-03 19:54:58	@Espyo	...Testyo?
2013-11-03 19:55:00	@J	that was part of it
2013-11-03 19:55:08	@J	Testyo is silly
2013-11-03 19:55:12	@Espyo	that shouldn't really be an unserious feature
2013-11-03 19:55:14	@Espyo	Testyo: unserious

2013-11-03 19:58:23	@Espyo	I must've made it a fun feature for a reason
2013-11-03 19:58:26	@Espyo	not going to argue with past me
2013-11-03 20:03:49	@Espyo	hey, the gang's all here
2013-11-03 20:03:55	@Espyo	I think it'd be a good idea to discuss the new layout now
2013-11-03 20:04:32	@PikFan	what layout?
2013-11-03 20:04:39	@Espyo	for the wiki
2013-11-03 20:04:42	@Espyo	hm, let's see
2013-11-03 20:05:05	@Espyo	ok, so I tried these 3:
2013-11-03 20:05:06	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/New%20Pikipedia%202.png
2013-11-03 20:05:07	@PikFan	(the wiki was a given, I just meant like what for)
2013-11-03 20:05:12	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/New%20Pikipedia%201b.png
2013-11-03 20:05:16	@PikFan	oh, that
2013-11-03 20:05:16	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/New%20Pikipedia%201.png
2013-11-03 20:06:52	@PikFan	I like https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/New%20Pikipedia%201b.png , but J would have to play around with the sidebar color
2013-11-03 20:06:59	@PikFan	and other things
2013-11-03 20:08:07	@Espyo	the color of visited links is also messed up
2013-11-03 20:12:05	@PikFan	okay just bought String Theory, my CpS is now 102,587,120.3
2013-11-03 20:12:29	@PikFan	and it also got me the Cookie Quasar achievement
2013-11-03 20:13:07	@Espyo	hm
2013-11-03 20:13:24	@J	I forget what I said before, but I prefer the 1st one
2013-11-03 20:13:24	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2013-11-03 20:14:05	@J	not sure what you've done to the content BG, though
2013-11-03 20:14:51	@Espyo	the first one being New Pikipedia 2.png?
2013-11-03 20:15:00	@J	yeah
2013-11-03 20:15:07	@J	the less bright green
2013-11-03 20:15:08	@J	top-down
2013-11-03 20:15:27	@J	doesn't go with the logo so well, but
2013-11-03 20:15:27	@Espyo	I like that one too, and it's a texture from the game
2013-11-03 20:15:32	@Espyo	but that grass is so beaten down...
2013-11-03 20:15:37	@Espyo	looks more like dry straw
2013-11-03 20:15:41	@J	well, it's not like the other does
2013-11-03 20:15:55	@J	I just prefer the detail
2013-11-03 20:16:11	@Espyo	the detail on the grass itself?
2013-11-03 20:16:13	@J	yes
2013-11-03 20:16:27	@Espyo	hm, I'll try to see if I can find a livelier grass texture from the game
2013-11-03 20:16:30	@Espyo	that also has detail
2013-11-03 20:16:32	@J	and if the content stays light, you get less contrast between the saturated colours and thet
2013-11-03 20:16:34	@J	*that
2013-11-03 20:16:46	@J	the brighter green is just too noisy and distracting
2013-11-03 20:17:19	@Espyo	I'll try The Final Trial's grass
2013-11-03 20:18:26	@J	why can't I find in my logs the time you brought this up before?
2013-11-03 20:18:52	@J	it was this year, right?
2013-11-03 20:20:15	@J	yeah, it says so in the screenshot
2013-11-03 20:21:16	@PikFan	okay, activated the GMAPCL, and I already have 5 Wrinklers
2013-11-03 20:21:57	@PikFan	make that 7
2013-11-03 20:21:59	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/New%20Pikipedia%203.png
2013-11-03 20:22:41	@J	that's the same
2013-11-03 20:24:27	@Espyo	...no it's not
2013-11-03 20:24:37	@Espyo	...is it?
2013-11-03 20:25:20	@Espyo	gaaaah
2013-11-03 20:25:21	@Espyo	it is
2013-11-03 20:25:36	@J	...
2013-11-03 20:25:43	@PikFan	popped the wrinklers, and now I'm at 2 trillion
2013-11-03 20:27:54	@Espyo	ok, try again, same URL
2013-11-03 20:28:59	Prezintenden	i like it. bit low res though
2013-11-03 20:29:12	@J	very pixelated at 100%
2013-11-03 20:29:17	@Espyo	yeah, don't know what's up with that
2013-11-03 20:29:33	@Espyo	the texture itself is already a bit poor
2013-11-03 20:29:46	@J	I think I still prefer the other one
2013-11-03 20:29:54	Prezintenden	i don't
2013-11-03 20:29:55	@J	it looks almost like a carpet
2013-11-03 20:30:40	Prezintenden	i think the top-down view of the moss and grass has a way more pikmin-feel to it
2013-11-03 20:30:59	@J	wait, which one are you comparing it to?
2013-11-03 20:31:15	Prezintenden	New Pikipedia 2.png?
2013-11-03 20:31:17	@J	I was saying I prefer 2
2013-11-03 20:31:19	@J	yeah
2013-11-03 20:31:20	@J	hmm
2013-11-03 20:31:25	@J	well, they're both top-down
2013-11-03 20:32:23	@Espyo	(V3 at 50% background image size incoming)
2013-11-03 20:32:34	@J	you're saying you prefer moss/grass to the fern-like stuff in 2?
2013-11-03 20:32:45	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/New%20Pikipedia%204.png
2013-11-03 20:33:16	@J	it looks better, but repeats too often

2013-11-03 20:34:22	Prezintenden	hi
2013-11-03 20:34:23	OfficialFantendo	what are we talking about
2013-11-03 20:34:59	Prezintenden	you could just take one that looks better but has duller colours and change the colours
2013-11-03 20:35:23	OfficialFantendo	im lost
2013-11-03 20:35:38	Prezintenden	pikipedia background image, we're looking for one

2013-11-03 20:35:58	OfficialFantendo	how can i do that
2013-11-03 20:36:06	@Espyo	I think I did that for V2, compared to V1
2013-11-03 20:36:11	Prezintenden	with you i meant me
2013-11-03 20:36:49	@Espyo	I thought you meant grab one of the grass texture images, and change the coloring

2013-11-03 20:45:17	Prezintenden	better than the other two, but i still prefer the newPik2 one
2013-11-03 20:45:34	@J	wait, I thought you said you didn't prefer that one
2013-11-03 20:45:55	OfficialFantendo	but we gotta keep it up to date! try pik3
2013-11-03 20:45:57	Prezintenden	i have a feeling your V2 differs from my V2
2013-11-03 20:46:05	@J	2 is the one with 2 in the URL
2013-11-03 20:46:19	Prezintenden	yes
2013-11-03 20:46:28	Prezintenden	i like that one
2013-11-03 20:46:32	@Espyo	note that I have a 1 and a 1b
2013-11-03 20:46:34	@Espyo	and a 2
2013-11-03 20:46:36	Prezintenden	i don't like the one with the 1

2013-11-03 20:48:31	@Espyo	I'm just not a big fan of the washed down colors
2013-11-03 20:48:45	@Espyo	say, why don't we have multiple styles?
2013-11-03 20:48:51	@Espyo	I think there's a wiki option for users to pick their own
2013-11-03 20:48:57	OfficialFantendo	j its important
2013-11-03 20:49:02	Prezintenden	that's what i was saying, you could just saturate the colours of 2

2013-11-03 20:49:24	@Espyo	just to make sure I'm not braindead, by saturate, you mean make them less washed out, less black-and-white
2013-11-03 20:49:31	Prezintenden	yes
2013-11-03 20:49:35	@Espyo	ok
2013-11-03 20:49:36	@J	that would be a pain
2013-11-03 20:49:52	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/P2.png looks like I made them washed down on purpose

2013-11-03 21:11:48	@Espyo	also, the term "HP" is still used a LOT in the Health article
2013-11-03 21:13:30	Prezintenden	I though that would be okay,  it was the title that was bothering
2013-11-03 21:13:53	Prezintenden	should i change them all to health?
2013-11-03 21:14:39	@Espyo	most, yes
2013-11-03 21:14:59	@PikFan	Espyo: have you heard this before http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vw3L7mDsT4
2013-11-03 21:15:24	@Espyo	hm
2013-11-03 21:15:52	@Espyo	it vaguely sounds like the forward version?
2013-11-03 21:16:05	@PikFan	yeah
2013-11-03 21:16:14	@Espyo	that's kinda neat
2013-11-03 21:16:26	@PikFan	it's backwards, which is weird, because it sounds like the forwards version
2013-11-03 21:17:38	@J	meh, I wouldn't worry so much about body text mentions
2013-11-03 21:18:59	Prezintenden	so I'm wondering, when it shows the bombrock timer, might that still be its health? we know that purple pikmin can force the timer down faster
2013-11-03 21:21:02	@J	makes sense
2013-11-03 21:21:23	@J	also other bomb rocks make it explode instantly
2013-11-03 21:28:15	@Espyo	hmmmm
2013-11-03 21:28:22	@Espyo	never really thought about that
2013-11-03 21:28:23	Prezintenden	eh, left it out, edited the HPs
2013-11-03 21:29:32	Prezintenden	it would be possible they have a low amount that is programmed to decay, seeing at how much damage a purple does
2013-11-03 21:29:56	@Espyo	yeah
2013-11-03 21:30:09	Prezintenden	anyway i should study some more. bye

2013-11-03 21:40:58	@J	hmm, not sure
2013-11-03 21:41:04	@J	I still think I prefer less saturation

2013-11-05 23:50:36	@PikFan	each wrinkler gave like something trillion cookies
2013-11-05 23:51:03	Espyo	hi
2013-11-05 23:51:05	@PikFan	aaaaaaaaaand I got up to 400+ trillion
2013-11-05 23:51:10	@PikFan	hi
2013-11-05 23:51:10	Espyo	nice
2013-11-05 23:51:18	Espyo	oh, a note: don't leave the game form one day to the next
2013-11-05 23:51:22	Espyo	wrinklers despawn
2013-11-05 23:51:25	Espyo	I learned that the hard way...
2013-11-05 23:51:33	Espyo	after every day, before you shut down your computer, pop 'em
2013-11-05 23:51:51	@PikFan	...you didn't know that closing the browser pops the wrinklers?
2013-11-05 23:52:37	@PikFan	well, anyway, left the computer on for a good 7 1/2 hours, so plenty of cookies were eaten by the wrinklers
2013-11-05 23:52:51	@PikFan	(or should I say /vomited/
2013-11-05 23:53:13	@PikFan	((er... yeah, I meant eaten, never mind))
2013-11-05 23:53:54	Espyo	it doesn't pop them
2013-11-05 23:53:56	Espyo	it makes them vanish
2013-11-05 23:54:01	Espyo	if it popped them, that'd be fine
2013-11-05 23:54:06	Espyo	but nope, I lost all the cookies they had sucked
2013-11-05 23:54:20	@PikFan	:|
2013-11-05 23:54:40	@PikFan	but yeah, I did mean vanish, guess I didn't use the right words
2013-11-05 23:54:44	Espyo	right
2013-11-05 23:55:50	@PikFan	ack, I've already bought 6 of the 7 Halloween cookies
2013-11-05 23:56:31	Espyo	they're "unlocked" when you pop wrinklers
2013-11-05 23:56:46	Espyo	so... maybe you should focus on letting wrinklers live after you've gotten the updates
2013-11-05 23:57:01	@PikFan	they have a 5% chance of appearing when you pop a wrinkler
2013-11-05 23:57:12	Espyo	mhm
2013-11-06 00:06:22	Espyo	going to bed now
2013-11-06 00:06:24	Espyo	tired, somehow
2013-11-06 00:06:37	@PikFan	g'night

2013-11-06 19:34:51	@J	...
2013-11-06 19:34:52	Testyo	Oh, J, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 06/11/2013 19:34 (GMT), saying: √ß.
2013-11-06 19:34:55	Espyo	hm, promising
2013-11-06 19:34:58	Espyo	now talk when you get ba‚Äî
2013-11-06 19:35:01	Espyo	ok, great
2013-11-06 19:35:02	@J	oh, took a while
2013-11-06 19:35:09	@J	oh, I see
2013-11-06 19:35:12	@J	got it
2013-11-06 19:35:21	@J	√ß
2013-11-06 19:35:28	Espyo	ok, now sending you a memo is actually useful
2013-11-06 19:35:35	@J	I don't know what I'm sayign
2013-11-06 19:35:41	@J	I thought you already set it up to do that?
2013-11-06 19:35:42	@J	*saying
2013-11-06 19:35:43	Espyo	or typing
2013-11-06 19:35:51	Espyo	well yeah, but if Testyo joins
2013-11-06 19:35:54	Espyo	he also checks for memos
2013-11-06 19:36:05	Espyo	regardless of whether the user only wants memos to be received when they talk or not
2013-11-06 19:40:17	@J	he seems to also send them to me when I join
2013-11-06 19:40:20	@J	which is probably bad
2013-11-06 19:40:27	Espyo	but he didn't this time
2013-11-06 19:40:31	Espyo	he used to, that was the whole problem
2013-11-06 19:40:37	Espyo	this time he only sent you my √ß when you said "..."
2013-11-06 19:40:49	Espyo	when he joined, he didn't send you it
2013-11-06 19:43:06	@J	no, when _I_ join

2013-11-08 20:47:32	Espyo	from the moment I learned wikia has achievements, I stopped doubting that /anything/ could be made to have achievements
2013-11-08 20:47:42	Espyo	oh, and for the most unsurprising revelation of 2013
2013-11-08 20:47:53	@J	it does?
2013-11-08 20:47:55	Espyo	those achievements are ways to manipulate people into handing over more money
2013-11-08 20:48:04	Espyo	it does
2013-11-08 20:48:14	Espyo	I am not even bending the truth in any way
2013-11-08 20:48:17	Espyo	also, dinner

2013-11-08 22:51:35	@J	so, you remember the physics thing I brought up a while back?
2013-11-08 22:51:42	@J	with grouping objects during frames?
2013-11-08 22:51:51	@J	...what do I do with friction in grouped collisions?
2013-11-08 22:58:07	Espyo	yep
2013-11-08 22:58:13	Espyo	hmm, friction
2013-11-08 22:58:16	Espyo	between members?
2013-11-08 23:07:10	@J	between the two groups
2013-11-08 23:08:48	Espyo	hmm
2013-11-08 23:08:56	Espyo	well, what do you mean how do you do it?
2013-11-08 23:09:03	Espyo	you do normal friction with the ground and suc
2013-11-08 23:09:03	Espyo	*h
2013-11-08 23:09:18	Espyo	and I suppose you approximate some collisions between the two groups, and...
2013-11-08 23:09:26	Espyo	...aren't you already doing collisions between the groups?
2013-11-08 23:13:54	@J	I mean, the collision is between 2 objects, but these objects have already collided so they're grouped
2013-11-08 23:14:21	@J	so I want to resolve a collision between 2 groups
2013-11-08 23:14:30	Espyo	right, it's what I thought
2013-11-08 23:14:37	Espyo	but what about collision between 2 groups?
2013-11-08 23:14:43	Espyo	friction kinda implies collision
2013-11-08 23:14:56	@J	do I just amalgamate everything into one big mass and do the collision with the friction between the 2 objects I started with?
2013-11-08 23:15:20	@J	or try to use different frictions for each collision that caused each object to be part of the group?
2013-11-08 23:15:24	@J	this probably doesn't make sense
2013-11-08 23:15:31	Espyo	I don't think we're thinking the same scenario
2013-11-08 23:15:40	Espyo	give me a scenario in which 2 groups... do something friction related
2013-11-08 23:19:28	@J	any time they collide while moving perpendicular to the collision direction

2013-11-08 23:21:35	@PikFan	.
2013-11-08 23:21:39	Espyo	I'd suggest frictioning the entire group
2013-11-08 23:21:43	Espyo	you treat groups like an object, yes?
2013-11-08 23:21:45	Espyo	hey PikFan
2013-11-08 23:21:48	@PikFan	hi
2013-11-08 23:21:55	@PikFan	so, what's this about?
2013-11-08 23:22:30	Espyo	J's physics engine
2013-11-08 23:22:35	@PikFan	ah
2013-11-08 23:22:45	Espyo	the Pikmin fangame engine is on a tiny pause while I work on a Brawl moment compilation clip
2013-11-08 23:22:51	Espyo	-clip
2013-11-08 23:22:56	@PikFan	so, we're going to start using Dropbox at school
2013-11-08 23:23:07	Espyo	great
2013-11-08 23:23:08	@J	yeah, that's the easiest way, so I guess I'll try that first
2013-11-08 23:23:16	@PikFan	oh hi J
2013-11-08 23:23:19	@J	hi
2013-11-08 23:23:26	Espyo	I can't really see the friction being unrealistic with that method
2013-11-08 23:25:37	@J	and I made it get into an infinite loop in the simplest possible case
2013-11-08 23:25:49	Espyo	hehe
2013-11-08 23:25:51	Espyo	 1 group?
2013-11-08 23:26:02	@J	1 thing hitting a wall
2013-11-08 23:26:17	@J	0 elasticity, no friction
2013-11-08 23:26:21	Espyo	heh
2013-11-08 23:30:06	@J	okay, fixed that, but now friction magically became infinite
2013-11-08 23:32:54	@J	...because I'm crazy
2013-11-08 23:33:05	@J	randomly divided velocity by the mass

2013-11-08 23:36:28	Espyo	randomly?
2013-11-08 23:36:41	@J	uh...no
2013-11-08 23:36:49	@J	I mean I was being random, not making the computer be random
2013-11-08 23:36:54	Espyo	drat
2013-11-08 23:37:03	@J	that would be pretty hard to do accidentally
2013-11-08 23:49:33	@J	gaaaaaaaah
2013-11-08 23:49:47	@J	okay, so 50 collisions becomes 2, and ~1500 becomes 4
2013-11-08 23:49:52	@J	but BAD THINGS HAPPEN
2013-11-08 23:50:13	Espyo	...
2013-11-08 23:50:45	@J	it seems friction between objects is crazy-infinite
2013-11-08 23:50:46	@PikFan	...J, you rarely use caps
2013-11-08 23:50:51	@J	...probably the same bug as before
2013-11-08 23:51:03	Espyo	yep
2013-11-08 23:51:17	@J	except I fixed that
2013-11-08 23:51:54	@J	also, previously it manifested as not moving; this time it's manifesting as teleportation
2013-11-08 23:52:25	@J	also, it only happens when against a wall
2013-11-08 23:53:24	@J	ah, and more collisions amplifies it
2013-11-08 23:53:31	@J	so it's not teleportation, just huge speed
2013-11-08 23:54:32	Espyo	did you have wall friction before this?
2013-11-08 23:56:34	@J	'have'?
2013-11-08 23:56:43	@J	have it implemented, or turned on?
2013-11-08 23:56:58	Espyo	implemented
2013-11-08 23:57:05	@J	yes, everything was implemented
2013-11-08 23:59:16	@J	it's not just when against a wall, but when against anything
2013-11-08 23:59:26	@J	that is, you need 3 objects in a row
2013-11-08 23:59:36	Espyo	right
2013-11-08 23:59:39	@J	...which I guess just means any collision actually using grouping

2013-11-09 00:40:58	@J	okay, fixed that, but there's a flaw in what I'm doing that means it feels like there's friction where there shouldn't be
2013-11-09 00:41:49	Espyo	I have a feeling this is one of those things that's a lot harder than it should
