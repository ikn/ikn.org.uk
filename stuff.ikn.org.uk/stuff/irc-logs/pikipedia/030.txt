2016-06-06 19:07:50	Marty2000	It must be
2016-06-06 19:07:53	Marty2000	5455-9421-4760
2016-06-06 19:07:56	Marty2000	I'll verify
2016-06-06 19:08:05	Marty2000	Yes it is
2016-06-06 19:08:38	UltraMario	2638-0093-3000
2016-06-06 19:09:07	Marty2000	Okay, i'll add you
2016-06-06 19:09:09	Marty2000	I'll*
2016-06-06 19:09:45	UltraMario	i think ill add a bit more 3ds rules before we start
2016-06-06 19:10:39	UltraMario	mostly stuff about what music to use
2016-06-06 19:10:40	Marty2000	Yeah, my game is updating right now anyway
2016-06-06 19:11:12	UltraMario	it'll work a bit different than the set up we have on the wii u version since the music selection is more like how melee's works
2016-06-06 19:11:23	UltraMario	where you hold r to get an alternate track
2016-06-06 19:11:34	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-06 19:11:53	UltraMario	ill go and specify what songs are recommended for the tourney :o
2016-06-06 19:11:54	UltraMario	also
2016-06-06 19:12:22	UltraMario	i added a lot of non melee stages recently, but they're only omega forms. i did this so we have more melee songs to fight with when we play
2016-06-06 19:12:42	UltraMario	since it's omega, it's not like it'll be too different, so thats a good thing
2016-06-06 19:12:55	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-06 19:14:25	UltraMario	also
2016-06-06 19:14:26	UltraMario	i
2016-06-06 19:14:35	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-06-06 19:14:38	UltraMario	'll specify that only the yoshi's island in the wii u version is allowed
2016-06-06 19:14:48	UltraMario	since the one in the 3ds version is a completely different stage altogether :p
2016-06-06 19:14:52	UltraMario	it just shares the same name
2016-06-06 19:15:00	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-06 19:15:47	UltraMario	hm
2016-06-06 19:15:54	UltraMario	i guess ill go and allow arena ferox too
2016-06-06 19:15:57	UltraMario	omega only, of course
2016-06-06 19:16:06	UltraMario	since i did allow omega castle siege in the wii u version
2016-06-06 19:16:17	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-06 19:16:22	UltraMario	the reason for that is that there was supposed to be a fire emblem stage in melee called AKANEIA :p
2016-06-06 19:16:54	UltraMario	since all we know about how it was supposed to be was that it was a fire emblem stage, i figured make it only omega since thats literally all we know
2016-06-06 19:17:03	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2016-06-06 19:17:35	Marty2000	Yeah, and I prefer the Omega version on that stage anyway
2016-06-06 19:17:38	UltraMario	hmm
2016-06-06 19:17:43	Marty2000	of that*
2016-06-06 19:17:47	UltraMario	should i separate 3ds exclusive stuff on my list?
2016-06-06 19:17:52	UltraMario	to make it easier to navigate
2016-06-06 19:18:40	Marty2000	If you care about what people will think of you and your organization and you care about their comfort, then you should
2016-06-06 19:18:57	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-06 19:19:01	UltraMario	i think it'd help avoid confusion
2016-06-06 19:19:06	UltraMario	;p
2016-06-06 19:19:08	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-06 19:19:49	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-06 19:19:55	@Espyo	about the digging data on the infobox
2016-06-06 19:19:57	@Espyo	should we add numbers?
2016-06-06 19:20:07	@Espyo	I think we should only keep it qualitative, like "slow", or "fast"
2016-06-06 19:20:21	@Espyo	although the numbers seem to match up, we can't confirm them through memory watching or reading the game's files
2016-06-06 19:20:29	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-06 19:20:38	Marty2000	Yeah, this is true
2016-06-06 19:20:39	@Espyo	so as far as we know, Red Pikmin are 1.45 times faster than Blues
2016-06-06 19:20:44	@Espyo	of course, that's likely not the case, but...
2016-06-06 19:20:49	UltraMario	illl let you know when im done patching the rules up
2016-06-06 19:20:50	@Espyo	I've seen weirder in this franchise
2016-06-06 19:20:51	Marty2000	I only added numbers to help people see how much faster they could be
2016-06-06 19:20:55	@Espyo	of course
2016-06-06 19:20:58	@Espyo	I get that
2016-06-06 19:21:04	Marty2000	But if it's ot helping, please remove
2016-06-06 19:21:04	@Espyo	but since they aren't confirmed, I don't know...
2016-06-06 19:21:06	Marty2000	not*
2016-06-06 19:21:20	Marty2000	Or how to say... not important infiormation
2016-06-06 19:21:20	@Espyo	it is helping, yes, but it's not official enough to be there like we know what we're talking about
2016-06-06 19:21:24	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-06 19:21:26	@Espyo	wait, I've got it
2016-06-06 19:21:34	@Espyo	we'll just say it's approximately 2x, or 1.5x or whatever
2016-06-06 19:21:37	@Espyo	done
2016-06-06 19:21:39	@Espyo	best of both worls
2016-06-06 19:21:42	@Espyo	*worlds
2016-06-06 19:21:51	Marty2000	He he, yes
2016-06-06 19:21:57	@Espyo	we keep the numbers, which are nice to have around, and we say these aren't confirmed
2016-06-06 19:21:58	@Espyo	well that was easy
2016-06-06 19:22:04	@Espyo	I'll take care of it
2016-06-06 19:22:08	Marty2000	Come to think of it
2016-06-06 19:22:11	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging#Pikmin_3_buried_objects
2016-06-06 19:22:22	Marty2000	I'm really think we should make a table
2016-06-06 19:22:28	@Espyo	yeah, same
2016-06-06 19:22:29	@Espyo	it's a bit of a mess
2016-06-06 19:22:35	Marty2000	Unless the organization is good enough... but it's a mess
2016-06-06 19:22:36	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-06-06 19:23:30	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Yellow_Pikmin&diff=next&oldid=166469
2016-06-06 19:23:33	@Espyo	>I'm just not allowed to use them. Don't get any ideas.
2016-06-06 19:23:35	@Espyo	what :|
2016-06-06 19:24:14	Marty2000	Hmm... I'm not sure to understand whether he wants to say "I don't get any ideas" or "don't get any ideas (you, imperative)
2016-06-06 19:24:26	@Espyo	I think the latter
2016-06-06 19:24:27	Marty2000	anyway, that's strange
2016-06-06 19:24:56	Marty2000	What ideas? What ideas could we get on him/her?
2016-06-06 19:25:00	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-06-06 19:25:51	Yoshi2	maybe people editing from an IP can't edit talk pages?
2016-06-06 19:26:16	@Espyo	they can
2016-06-06 19:26:26	@Espyo	that annoying guy that keeps editing [[Talk:Pikmin 4]], for instance
2016-06-06 19:26:27	Testyo	"Talk:Pikmin_4" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Pikmin_4
2016-06-06 19:26:34	UltraMario	done with the rules
2016-06-06 19:26:50	Marty2000	Ok, I'm waiting for you ;)
2016-06-06 19:26:57	UltraMario	should i make a room?
2016-06-06 19:27:22	Marty2000	Oh, by the way, I've noticed something for those who have lots of My Nintendo medals/points (I don't know what it exactly is)
2016-06-06 19:27:27	Marty2000	Yes, UltraMario
2016-06-06 19:27:35	Marty2000	If you have enough medals....
2016-06-06 19:27:42	Marty2000	you can get Pikmin 3 DLC's
2016-06-06 19:27:47	UltraMario	:o
2016-06-06 19:28:33	UltraMario	made a room
2016-06-06 19:28:34	@Espyo	there, I think they're more correct and easier to understand now
2016-06-06 19:30:01	Marty2000	Hmm, sorry, I chose "random"
2016-06-06 19:30:03	UltraMario	thats not in the list :p
2016-06-06 19:30:06	UltraMario	oic
2016-06-06 19:30:07	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-06 19:30:13	Marty2000	Please link me to your list again
2016-06-06 19:30:16	Marty2000	If you don't mind
2016-06-06 19:30:19	UltraMario	you can change what stages appear in random btw
2016-06-06 19:30:20	UltraMario	:o
2016-06-06 19:30:22	UltraMario	http://pastebin.com/raw/FuKgAXP5
2016-06-06 19:30:26	@Espyo	hm, I wonder if the game's files have any data on how many Pikmin can dig at once
2016-06-06 19:30:28	@Espyo	and speeds
2016-06-06 19:30:29	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-06-06 19:30:31	UltraMario	np
2016-06-06 19:30:52	Marty2000	Espyo: For the speeds, I check twice
2016-06-06 19:30:53	Marty2000	always
2016-06-06 19:31:04	@Espyo	good
2016-06-06 19:31:08	Marty2000	And if I have any difference
2016-06-06 19:31:19	Marty2000	It's only a matter of 1 or 2 seconds
2016-06-06 19:31:32	Marty2000	It will be different for the fully buried objects, though
2016-06-06 19:31:36	Marty2000	There's a window for them
2016-06-06 19:31:51	Marty2000	A window of few seconds for Yellows and Rocks...
2016-06-06 19:32:17	Marty2000	And a difference of a few minutes for Whites and Winged Pikmin...
2016-06-06 19:33:15	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-06 19:34:16	UltraMario	pfff
2016-06-06 19:34:33	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-06 19:35:57	UltraMario	woo
2016-06-06 19:35:58	Marty2000	That bomb
2016-06-06 19:36:00	Marty2000	So Espyo
2016-06-06 19:36:02	Marty2000	For example,
2016-06-06 19:36:05	UltraMario	i liked when i spilt oil on you
2016-06-06 19:36:06	UltraMario	:P
2016-06-06 19:36:06	Marty2000	In Silver Lake Remix
2016-06-06 19:36:16	Marty2000	I tried to dig out a fully buried Golden Greande
2016-06-06 19:36:24	Marty2000	With a White Pikmin
2016-06-06 19:36:28	Marty2000	And a Yellow Pikmin
2016-06-06 19:36:32	Marty2000	Twice for each Pikmin
2016-06-06 19:36:46	Marty2000	With the White Pikmin: 5:00min and then, 6:00min
2016-06-06 19:37:04	Marty2000	For the Yellow, it was around 1:09min and 1:15min
2016-06-06 19:37:39	Marty2000	So there is clearly a part of randomness for those objects....
2016-06-06 19:38:28	@Espyo	yikes
2016-06-06 19:38:36	@Espyo	that's not very fair
2016-06-06 19:38:48	@Espyo	if you come up with a strategy that involves leaving one White to dig something up
2016-06-06 19:38:52	@Espyo	you'll be at the mercy of the RNG
2016-06-06 19:40:00	Yoshi2	one minute difference is unacceptable
2016-06-06 19:40:13	@Espyo	very
2016-06-06 19:40:33	UltraMario	DAMN
2016-06-06 19:40:36	UltraMario	that rest :p
2016-06-06 19:40:36	Marty2000	In Mission Mode, it is
2016-06-06 19:40:39	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-06 19:40:43	UltraMario	you forgot the items tho :p
2016-06-06 19:40:46	UltraMario	although
2016-06-06 19:40:53	UltraMario	you made me think of something
2016-06-06 19:40:53	@Espyo	Marty2000: do the same fruits take the same time to unearth?
2016-06-06 19:41:07	@Espyo	like, does a Zest Bomb ALWAYS take X  time to dig out, regardless of game mode or stage?
2016-06-06 19:41:10	Marty2000	Depends on whether the fruit is partially or fully uried
2016-06-06 19:41:16	UltraMario	maybe instead of making smash ball a thing thats on only when you play as bowser
2016-06-06 19:41:16	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-06-06 19:41:18	Marty2000	But if they belong to the same category, it seems so
2016-06-06 19:41:19	UltraMario	i could make it so
2016-06-06 19:41:28	UltraMario	he's his own separate thing
2016-06-06 19:41:39	UltraMario	so when you want to fight giga bowser smash ball would be the only item
2016-06-06 19:41:58	UltraMario	would that be more fair?
2016-06-06 19:41:59	Marty2000	But I'm not sure, Espyo
2016-06-06 19:42:04	Marty2000	I have to get all times for all objects
2016-06-06 19:42:17	Marty2000	Probably, UltraMario
2016-06-06 19:42:20	UltraMario	hm
2016-06-06 19:45:21	UltraMario	rip
2016-06-06 19:45:23	@Espyo	baaah
2016-06-06 19:45:49	@Espyo	there's no data anywhere in the game's files about how "buried" something is, how long it takes to dig it out, nor how many Pikimin can go at it at once
2016-06-06 19:45:55	@Espyo	heck, the files don't even say if something IS buried
2016-06-06 19:45:57	@Espyo	much less by how much
2016-06-06 19:46:24	Marty2000	:/
2016-06-06 19:47:02	Marty2000	Some objects are pretty long to dig out in Story Mode, though
2016-06-06 19:47:23	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging#Distant_Tundra Here, I couldn't use a Blue Pikmin for the Astringent Clump
2016-06-06 19:48:05	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-06 19:50:24	UltraMario	rip
2016-06-06 19:50:39	Marty2000	I can tell Marth isn't your main character ;)
2016-06-06 19:50:57	Marty2000	But you were good with him, don't worry
2016-06-06 19:51:12	UltraMario	or maybe it was because i got screwed over by the rng :p
2016-06-06 19:51:30	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-06 19:56:00	UltraMario	NAILED IT

2016-06-06 20:39:29	Marty2000	How would you guys call a gray Pellet? Rock Pellet or Gray Pellet? I'd choose the latter, but I'm not sure because of "Rock Pikmin"
2016-06-06 20:39:39	@PikFan	Gray Pellet, yeah
2016-06-06 20:40:03	@PikFan	though you should probably say "gray" instead of "Gray" though
2016-06-06 20:40:20	Marty2000	Yeah, gray
2016-06-06 20:40:22	Marty2000	Thanks ;)

2016-06-06 20:48:37	Marty2000	<Espyo>: Marty2000: do the same fruits take the same time to unearth?  We'll know soon since there is a Pocked Airhead in the Garden of Hope and another one in the Tropical Wilds

2016-06-06 20:49:06	Marty2000	But to be honest, I think the times will be different
2016-06-06 20:49:29	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging#Clockwork_Chasm There's also one in that area
2016-06-06 20:49:45	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-06 20:50:20	Marty2000	I can guess it because it looks much faster in the Garden of Hope than in the Clockwork Chasm
2016-06-06 20:53:10	Marty2000	it looks much faster → it looks slightly faster

2016-06-06 20:55:48	@Espyo	but it probably depends on the level of burial
2016-06-06 20:55:57	@Espyo	if you get the same times, chances are it's only because they're buried the same amount
2016-06-06 20:56:35	Marty2000	Chances are that my Blue Pikmin will not be able to dig out the fruit completely because of the sunset :p

2016-06-06 21:10:51	@Espyo	but I know different things have different maximums
2016-06-06 21:10:54	@Espyo	I remember on Silver Lake Remix
2016-06-06 21:11:08	@Espyo	I always put Brittany to throw 8 White Pikmin on one pile and 7 on the other
2016-06-06 21:11:19	@Espyo	it needs to be 8/7 because one of the piles can only take 7
2016-06-06 21:11:27	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-06 21:11:41	Marty2000	I'll try in the Tropical Wilds, so we'll see
2016-06-06 21:21:34	Marty2000	It clearly doesn't depend on the level of burial
2016-06-06 21:21:45	Marty2000	It's at the same level in both areas (or nearly)
2016-06-06 21:21:49	Marty2000	And look at that:
2016-06-06 21:21:57	Marty2000	Time needed to dig out the object: 6:35 min.
2016-06-06 21:22:03	Marty2000	Maximum number of Pikmin that can dig out the object at once: 34

2016-06-06 21:49:30	Marty2000	I didn't ordered the Pikmin to dig it up, simply I threw a bomb rock at it

2016-06-07 00:41:27	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-06-07 00:41:32	Scruffy	Hi Pikfan!
2016-06-07 00:41:52	@PikFan	you joined 7 minutes ago, but didn't say anything :P
2016-06-07 00:43:43	Scruffy	Yeah, my internet has been patchy
2016-06-07 00:43:49	Scruffy	But I think now it's good
2016-06-07 00:43:55	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-06-07 00:44:02	@PikFan	how's the movie going?
2016-06-07 00:44:31	Scruffy	I finished modeling all the Pikmin actors I need
2016-06-07 00:44:44	@PikFan	yay
2016-06-07 00:45:51	Scruffy	I devised a way to control the Blue Pikmin's mouth that's hopefully pretty similar to the real Short Movies
2016-06-07 00:46:12	@PikFan	heh, nice
2016-06-07 00:46:21	@PikFan	ah, I should watch the Short Movies again...
2016-06-07 00:46:43	@PikFan	the Short Movies are proof that Nintendo can make good movies
2016-06-07 00:46:46	Scruffy	I have to watch them a bunch to get info about the look and animation of it
2016-06-07 00:46:47	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-07 00:46:55	Scruffy	Definitely, there's so much detail to it
2016-06-07 00:47:00	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-07 00:47:11	@PikFan	couldn't you use SFM?
2016-06-07 00:47:29	Scruffy	I could, but then it wouldn't look like the actual short movies
2016-06-07 00:47:44	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-07 00:47:47	Scruffy	The lighting would be advanced, but not as much as I'd like it
2016-06-07 00:48:03	@PikFan	you're trying to recreate the feel and atmosphere of the Short Movies?
2016-06-07 00:48:08	@PikFan	props, man
2016-06-07 00:48:20	Scruffy	Yep
2016-06-07 00:48:35	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-06-07 00:49:07	@PikFan	I want to learn Blender sometime...
2016-06-07 00:49:13	@PikFan	but a) I need my own computer
2016-06-07 00:49:21	@PikFan	b) I need to download Blender
2016-06-07 00:49:30	@PikFan	c) learn how to use it
2016-06-07 00:49:56	Scruffy	Well... I could help with c) at least
2016-06-07 00:50:14	Scruffy	Blender can also edit videos, and mix audio with videos
2016-06-07 00:50:25	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-07 00:50:45	@PikFan	oh, speaking of wanting to learn Blender
2016-06-07 00:50:50	@PikFan	Neo hasn't been around lately
2016-06-07 00:51:00	Scruffy	True, I've been wondering where he is
2016-06-07 00:51:42	@PikFan	well, just sent him a message on Google+
2016-06-07 00:52:00	@PikFan	but he hasn't posted anything on there lately, either
2016-06-07 00:52:06	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-06-07 00:52:50	@PikFan	hope he turns up soon, he was getting really good with his renders
2016-06-07 00:53:03	Scruffy	Agreed, I hope so too
2016-06-07 00:53:32	Scruffy	In other news, my brother and I just 100% completed Super Mario Sunshine today, after owning it for like 10 years or so
2016-06-07 00:53:42	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-07 00:53:55	@PikFan	it's funny, I was watching this video the other day
2016-06-07 00:54:01	Scruffy	It took the Internet to figure out all the blue coin locations (the last 14), but it was worth it
2016-06-07 00:54:19	@PikFan	and somebody randomly says, "Are you a Mario Sunshine 2 person or a Galaxy 3 person?"
2016-06-07 00:54:24	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-07 00:54:54	@PikFan	but yeah, some other person said that the way that ink looks in Splatoon that a Mario Sunshine 2 would look fantastic
2016-06-07 00:55:38	Scruffy	heh
2016-06-07 00:55:42	Scruffy	I agree
2016-06-07 00:56:02	Scruffy	with new nozzles and enemies and such
2016-06-07 00:56:11	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-07 00:56:16	Scruffy	the pacing and feel of the game was just fantastic
2016-06-07 00:56:26	@PikFan	I never played it...
2016-06-07 00:56:28	@PikFan	:(
2016-06-07 00:56:44	Scruffy	Do you have a GameCube or a Wii?
2016-06-07 00:57:04	@PikFan	both
2016-06-07 00:57:04	Scruffy	Although, it's probably hard to find nowadays
2016-06-07 00:57:38	@PikFan	the one thing about it I do know is the voice acting
2016-06-07 00:57:59	Scruffy	Yeah, it's a plus and a minuss
2016-06-07 00:58:04	Scruffy	minus*
2016-06-07 00:58:09	@PikFan	so I've heard
2016-06-07 00:58:48	Scruffy	The locals of the island, the Piantas and Nokis, are well-casted and greatly performed
2016-06-07 00:58:56	Scruffy	The characters you know, not as much
2016-06-07 00:59:00	Scruffy	Especially Bowser
2016-06-07 00:59:41	Scruffy	But I've come to look past it
2016-06-07 00:59:54	Scruffy	Now it kind of just seems like a joke the game is telling
2016-06-07 00:59:57	Scruffy	And it's funny
2016-06-07 01:00:27	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-07 01:01:04	@PikFan	kinda like Nintendo is saying "hey, let's give the fans a reason why we DON'T do voice acting"
2016-06-07 01:01:33	Scruffy	It got me researching what else the voice actors have done
2016-06-07 01:01:42	Scruffy	And it's not much, but it's very amusing
2016-06-07 01:02:25	Scruffy	I don't know if you've ever heard of the character Putt-putt the Car
2016-06-07 01:02:35	@PikFan	nope
2016-06-07 01:02:48	Scruffy	who was the star in a series of point-and-click puzzle games
2016-06-07 01:04:02	@PikFan	lol wow
2016-06-07 01:04:07	@PikFan	Bowser's voice IS funny
2016-06-07 01:04:18	@PikFan	I...
2016-06-07 01:04:20	@PikFan	wow
2016-06-07 01:04:32	Scruffy	but Scott Burns, the voice of Bowser from Sunshine up until Galaxy, was plenty of non-threatening voices in it
2016-06-07 01:04:35	@PikFan	but Bowser Jr's voice is pretty good
2016-06-07 01:04:40	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-07 01:07:01	Scruffy	what I really like about Sunshine is that it doesn't need a lot of voice acting to get its story across
2016-06-07 01:07:29	Scruffy	And that you have an easily understandable goal, but you can choose to delve into the backstory if you want to by talking to NPCs
2016-06-07 01:07:37	@PikFan	mhm
2016-06-07 01:08:00	Scruffy	I was discussing this yesterday with my brother, actually
2016-06-07 01:08:45	Scruffy	If you have a game with a super-rich story that constantly reminds you you're a part of this story, you can't get as immersed because you feel like the choices you make aren't necessarily the choices the character /would/ make as an actor
2016-06-07 01:09:28	Scruffy	But in a game like Mario, there is no in-depth backstory or story tie-ins, so you feel that anything you do is what Mario could or would do
2016-06-07 01:10:20	@PikFan	and that's why I like a game with nonlinear gameplay, which is what the new Zelda is rumored to have
2016-06-07 01:10:23	Scruffy	He's a vessel for your exploration of a branching world, rather than a means of fitting into a linear world
2016-06-07 01:10:25	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-07 01:10:36	Scruffy	That's just how I feel about it anyway
2016-06-07 01:11:31	Scruffy	So when I see a game like the Uncharted series, I feel that an in-depth story is a great way to explore video games as a storytelling art form, but at the same time I feel like I can't become the protagonist because I haven't been through what he's been through
2016-06-07 01:12:07	@PikFan	mm
2016-06-07 01:12:30	Scruffy	whereas in a Zelda game, that's barely stressed, or just put aside in the name of exploring the present world that builds its story around your gameplay
2016-06-07 01:12:59	Scruffy	It's also why Uncharted would more seamlessly make a movie than Zelda
2016-06-07 01:13:27	Scruffy	Uncharted is basically a movie already, just with parts where the main character dies a lot for some reason
2016-06-07 01:13:34	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-07 01:13:52	@PikFan	oh, I'm talking to Neo right now
2016-06-07 01:13:56	Scruffy	Oh neat
2016-06-07 01:14:25	Scruffy	Oh, I'm also making another narrated Youtube vidoe
2016-06-07 01:14:29	Scruffy	video*
2016-06-07 01:14:38	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-07 01:14:40	@PikFan	what about?
2016-06-07 01:14:50	Scruffy	I'm going to talk about the symbolic significance of the Plasm Wraith
2016-06-07 01:15:24	Scruffy	A lot of people have tried to theorize what it is. I've got a theory as to what it /means/.
2016-06-07 01:15:41	@PikFan	oh, THAT one
2016-06-07 01:15:57	@PikFan	also, Neo should be joining any second
2016-06-07 01:15:58	Scruffy	yeah, I discovered the unfinished script the other day and decided to complete it
2016-06-07 01:16:09	@PikFan	nice, can't wait to watch it

2016-06-07 01:54:50	Neocraftz1553	so, it carries the stickybomb to the enemys area, and then it explodes
2016-06-07 01:55:14	Neocraftz1553	along with the main canister and any nearby canisters
2016-06-07 01:55:36	Neocraftz1553	now that I think about, its more funny when your the one giving the gift

2016-06-07 13:34:19	Marty2000	Have you uploaded it?
2016-06-07 13:37:44	Yoshi2	no
2016-06-07 13:37:50	Yoshi2	it will take longer to encode/upload too
2016-06-07 13:37:58	Yoshi2	because I recorded it at a higher resolution
2016-06-07 13:38:45	Yoshi2	2x internal compared to 1.5x internal
2016-06-07 13:40:13	Marty2000	I see

2016-06-07 15:08:17	Marty2000	And even then, I disconnected from the chat but before sleeping, I use the "Random page" feature to make slight changes

2016-06-07 15:22:06	Yoshi2	goddamnit I just noticed that my encoding process turned the higher res footage into 960x720 again
2016-06-07 15:22:28	Yoshi2	and I already deleted the raws

2016-06-07 15:23:41	Yoshi2	or not
2016-06-07 15:29:40	Yoshi2	seems the footage ended up being lower than the internal resolution, odd
2016-06-07 15:30:22	Yoshi2	the other footage I did had the internal resolution
2016-06-07 15:31:19	Marty2000	Weird

2016-06-07 15:37:24	Yoshi2	in your case you can probably deal with it e.g. by upscaling the lower res videos
2016-06-07 15:38:04	Yoshi2	in my case, for some random reason dolphin might just decide to make the footage at a res lower than the internal resolution, and I'm screwed

2016-06-07 16:49:33	CreativeSushi	Oh yeah, we got in contact with the guy that did that
2016-06-07 16:49:37	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-07 16:49:37	CreativeSushi	he's going to be in the next pikcast
2016-06-07 16:49:57	CreativeSushi	which is hopefully going to be out before E3
2016-06-07 16:50:04	@PikFan	E3...
2016-06-07 16:50:18	@PikFan	as much as I'm hyped for Zelda...
2016-06-07 16:50:35	CreativeSushi	Well, there can still be a Nintendo Direct during E3
2016-06-07 16:50:40	CreativeSushi	They did that one year
2016-06-07 16:50:43	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-07 16:50:51	@PikFan	well, they haven't told us everything
2016-06-07 16:50:56	CreativeSushi	In fact, Luther shared some news with me the other day
2016-06-07 16:50:59	@PikFan	maybe we're in for a surprise
2016-06-07 16:51:05	CreativeSushi	that a leaker said 2 things
2016-06-07 16:51:10	@PikFan	oh?
2016-06-07 16:51:15	CreativeSushi	1. That Pikmin 4 was going to be shown at E3
2016-06-07 16:51:28	CreativeSushi	And 2. That a game by Nordic games was going to be released
2016-06-07 16:51:37	CreativeSushi	and shortly after this leaker posted this information 
2016-06-07 16:51:41	CreativeSushi	number 2 came true
2016-06-07 16:51:53	-->	Scruffy (Mibbit@179-777-1-60.lightspeed.chtnsc.sbcglobal.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-07 16:52:01	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-06-07 16:52:02	@PikFan	it's funny you mention Nordic games
2016-06-07 16:52:02	CreativeSushi	Which makes him somewhat viable 
2016-06-07 16:52:05	CreativeSushi	Hey scruffy 
2016-06-07 16:52:05	@PikFan	hey Scruffy
2016-06-07 16:52:23	Scruffy	Hey!
2016-06-07 16:52:28	@PikFan	because I just searched it, and they made a game called "Panzer Elite"
2016-06-07 16:52:52	@PikFan	Yoshi2 has been arguing with another user on TCRF over the name of an unused treasure in Pikmin 2
2016-06-07 16:53:05	Scruffy	I just downloaded the "Occupational Hazards" short movie, and I was going through it frame by frame to draw animation influence for my Pikmin short movie
2016-06-07 16:53:15	@PikFan	and its name starts with either Panther or Panzer
2016-06-07 16:53:24	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-06-07 16:53:25	@PikFan	awesome!
2016-06-07 16:53:34	CreativeSushi	dang, on the pc?
2016-06-07 16:53:43	Scruffy	Mac
2016-06-07 16:53:49	@PikFan	same difference :P
2016-06-07 16:54:01	CreativeSushi	Oh, I just thought you were like constantly pausing your wii u
2016-06-07 16:54:08	CreativeSushi	I was going to be very impressed XD
2016-06-07 16:54:13	@PikFan	how did you download it onto your computer?
2016-06-07 16:54:14	Scruffy	Oh heh, no that would be too impressive
2016-06-07 16:54:20	Scruffy	It's on Dailymotion
2016-06-07 16:54:27	Scruffy	I just found a site that could convert videos
2016-06-07 16:54:39	@PikFan	naughty naughty, Scruffy
2016-06-07 16:54:40	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-07 16:54:48	CreativeSushi	I'm surprised actually with how much they've been taking that stuff down from Youtube
2016-06-07 16:55:06	Scruffy	Well I mean, that's not supposed to be anywhere but on the wii u app
2016-06-07 16:55:14	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy and CreativeSushi
2016-06-07 16:55:21	Scruffy	and certainly not in 1080 HD
2016-06-07 16:55:23	CreativeSushi	Hey marty
2016-06-07 16:55:27	Scruffy	Hi Marty
2016-06-07 16:55:27	@PikFan	I really hate it when they say that a video isn't available in your country because it belongs to so and so :\
2016-06-07 16:55:38	CreativeSushi	:P
2016-06-07 16:55:53	CreativeSushi	Guys, we need more people on the forums
2016-06-07 16:56:10	CreativeSushi	Oh geeze, I still have those trailer files
2016-06-07 16:56:24	CreativeSushi	god I'm lazy
2016-06-07 16:56:28	Scruffy	I'm making a Pikmin short movie, perhaps I could add a message to visit the forums
2016-06-07 16:56:28	@PikFan	more people
2016-06-07 16:56:35	@PikFan	we need OVER 9000
2016-06-07 16:56:38	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-07 16:56:46	@PikFan	oh!
2016-06-07 16:56:53	CreativeSushi	There are so many Youtubers out there that need to join
2016-06-07 16:57:07	CreativeSushi	I also realized that ads my be a deterrent.
2016-06-07 16:57:13	@PikFan	Scruffy, will you be making a teaser or trailer at some point?
2016-06-07 16:57:20	@PikFan	CreativeSushi: what ads?
2016-06-07 16:57:37	CreativeSushi	well, do you have adblock?
2016-06-07 16:57:46	Scruffy	I can make a teaser at some point, but I have to finish modeling first
2016-06-07 16:58:04	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-07 16:58:07	Yoshi2	PikFan: for the moment, the Panther-Panzer issue is on ice because that guy did get my pings, and he hasn't done anything yet :|
2016-06-07 16:58:19	@PikFan	oh lol
2016-06-07 16:58:36	CreativeSushi	https://i.gyazo.com/1b128fa4a0a54bf955691e16d1cfff72.png
2016-06-07 16:58:42	@PikFan	he just doesn't want to face the wrath of your intellect
2016-06-07 16:58:46	CreativeSushi	Because there are ads
2016-06-07 16:58:54	@PikFan	and I don't have adblock
2016-06-07 16:59:10	Scruffy	I do have adblock, but the site asks me to consider supporting the site and removing the adblock
2016-06-07 16:59:22	@PikFan	I mean, if they're intrusive ads like the ones on wikia, I get pissed
2016-06-07 16:59:31	@PikFan	but I generally ignore ads like that
2016-06-07 16:59:35	CreativeSushi	yeah, I see that too
2016-06-07 16:59:52	@PikFan	heck, there's an ad at the top of my mibbit chat window, but I never pay attention to it
2016-06-07 16:59:54	CreativeSushi	Its $6 a month to get rid of them
2016-06-07 17:00:03	@PikFan	yuck
2016-06-07 17:00:14	CreativeSushi	but it is site-wide
2016-06-07 17:00:33	CreativeSushi	so it gets rid of them for everyone on the pikipedia forums 
2016-06-07 17:00:39	@PikFan	right
2016-06-07 17:00:46	CreativeSushi	or you can by them just for yourself, that will work on any proboards forums
2016-06-07 17:01:00	CreativeSushi	I also need to make an Icon for the website 
2016-06-07 17:01:04	CreativeSushi	like a tab icon
2016-06-07 17:01:09	CreativeSushi	I can actually do that somehow
2016-06-07 17:01:20	@PikFan	oh, a favicon?
2016-06-07 17:01:41	CreativeSushi	like this https://i.gyazo.com/8af29de4cb9facf3441fc48fe7cbe2ce.png
2016-06-07 17:01:58	@PikFan	yeah, I know what you meant
2016-06-07 17:02:04	@PikFan	it's called a favicon iirc
2016-06-07 17:02:18	@PikFan	oh, it is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon
2016-06-07 17:02:19	CreativeSushi	Oh ok
2016-06-07 17:02:51	Scruffy	This animation is sooooo amazing!!!
2016-06-07 17:03:05	@PikFan	Occupational Hazards?
2016-06-07 17:03:19	Scruffy	For a game with so many memorable glitches, I can't find anything that isn't amazingly executed in thi
2016-06-07 17:03:21	Scruffy	this*
2016-06-07 17:03:50	Scruffy	I mean I found a few minor goofs, but they're barely noticeable, and from my Blender experience they're perfectly pardonable
2016-06-07 17:03:57	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-07 17:04:22	@PikFan	put them on the wiki, I think we're all interested in these goofs now
2016-06-07 17:04:33	@PikFan	well, I am, anyway
2016-06-07 17:04:59	Scruffy	They aren't really even worth mentioning, they're so slight
2016-06-07 17:05:13	Scruffy	For example, the smoke trail that the White Pikmin leaves when rocketing up to the sky
2016-06-07 17:05:13	@PikFan	lol okay
2016-06-07 17:05:40	Scruffy	It's slightly before the Pikmin
2016-06-07 17:06:06	Scruffy	And the scene where another White Pikmin is spraying poison everywhere and the other Pikmin are trying to restrain him
2016-06-07 17:06:31	Scruffy	In that scene it looks like they used the lower-res version of the crane model, all the textures and shapes are lower resolution
2016-06-07 17:06:46	Scruffy	But it's not major enough to notice
2016-06-07 17:06:49	CreativeSushi	Alright, I added a favicon, but it did remove transparancy
2016-06-07 17:07:21	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-07 17:07:46	CreativeSushi	looking into it
2016-06-07 17:07:53	@PikFan	my only question would be is if it's a png file, but that seems insufficient
2016-06-07 17:08:18	CreativeSushi	actually I think your right
2016-06-07 17:08:26	@PikFan	...oh
2016-06-07 17:08:28	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-07 17:08:46	CreativeSushi	nope, filetype not allowed
2016-06-07 17:09:10	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-07 17:09:24	@PikFan	well, you can always ask Espyo whenever he gets on, I guess
2016-06-07 17:09:39	@PikFan	or maybe J, if he's around
2016-06-07 17:09:50	CreativeSushi	Its not possible to have transparency, its a proboards thing
2016-06-07 17:09:57	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-07 17:10:01	CreativeSushi	Espyo hasn't messed with the forums at all
2016-06-07 17:10:03	@PikFan	that's dumb, then
2016-06-07 17:10:16	CreativeSushi	So I'm thinking a redesign is in order
2016-06-07 17:10:34	@PikFan	in all honesty, it's such a minor thing that I don't think people will care about it
2016-06-07 17:10:46	@PikFan	the transparency, I mean
2016-06-07 17:10:59	CreativeSushi	Well theres that
2016-06-07 17:11:12	CreativeSushi	but what I have now I feel people will get confused with the wiki
2016-06-07 17:11:20	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-07 17:11:23	CreativeSushi	which honestly, what I have now should be the wiki's favicon
2016-06-07 17:11:31	CreativeSushi	I'm going to change it to a strawberry
2016-06-07 17:11:37	@PikFan	oh, that works
2016-06-07 17:11:39	CreativeSushi	since thats kinda our theme a bit
2016-06-07 17:11:50	CreativeSushi	and a straberry is more square
2016-06-07 17:11:57	@PikFan	I was going to suggest a bud, since Pikipedia is the flower and Pikmin Fanon is a leaf
2016-06-07 17:12:14	@PikFan	but the strawberry works too
2016-06-07 17:12:14	CreativeSushi	clever, but there are no offical bud icons 
2016-06-07 17:12:20	CreativeSushi	so I'd have to make one
2016-06-07 17:12:26	CreativeSushi	at least not from pikmin 2
2016-06-07 17:12:37	CreativeSushi	pikmin 3 might have one somewhere

2016-06-07 17:15:03	CreativeSushi	perfect
2016-06-07 17:15:08	CreativeSushi	and then I can put a strawberry on it
2016-06-07 17:15:23	@PikFan	good idea
2016-06-07 17:17:40	@PikFan	wow http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/stuff/irc-logs/pikipedia/030.txt
2016-06-07 17:17:51	@PikFan	can't believe there's already 31 pages of logs

2016-06-07 17:20:50	CreativeSushi	hmmm
2016-06-07 17:21:02	CreativeSushi	The blue doesn't really show the strawberry very clearly
2016-06-07 17:21:03	@PikFan	2016-06-06 18:51:37	Testyo	the way you guys are thinking is great, sure
2016-06-07 17:21:07	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-06-07 17:22:30	@PikFan	Scruffy: any progress on the Plasm Wraith video?
2016-06-07 17:24:41	Scruffy	Yep, script's almost done
2016-06-07 17:24:48	CreativeSushi	Take a look at the favicon, does it look good? 
2016-06-07 17:24:59	CreativeSushi	It almost seems like its too detailed for such a small image to me
2016-06-07 17:25:11	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-06-07 17:25:16	CreativeSushi	but I really only want it to be distinguishable 
2016-06-07 17:25:22	@PikFan	it looks alright

2016-06-07 17:28:31	@PikFan	I can see where you're coming from, but it's just speculation

2016-06-07 17:30:41	@PikFan	does the infobox look broken to anyone
2016-06-07 17:31:46	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-07 17:31:51	Marty2000	Broken for me too
2016-06-07 17:32:13	@PikFan	quick, let's check the other ship part pages
2016-06-07 17:32:34	Marty2000	Ah, Espyo made several changes yesterday or two days ago
2016-06-07 17:32:42	Marty2000	in order to simplify the infobox
2016-06-07 17:32:47	Marty2000	infoboxes*
2016-06-07 17:32:55	Marty2000	So maybe he didn't see that
2016-06-07 17:33:03	@PikFan	he broke the infoboxes
2016-06-07 17:33:20	Marty2000	And he also added the digging speed to the Pikmin infobox
2016-06-07 17:33:33	Marty2000	I'll check if other infoboxes are fine
2016-06-07 17:33:51	@PikFan	they're all broken
2016-06-07 17:34:00	@PikFan	...gah, why do I keep typing "broken" as "borken"
2016-06-07 17:34:49	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Red_Bulborb Fine for enemies
2016-06-07 17:35:26	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/The_Forest_of_Hope Fine for areas
2016-06-07 17:35:35	Marty2000	It must be only for the ship part infobox, then
2016-06-07 17:35:54	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Emergence_Cave Ok for caves
2016-06-07 17:38:55	@PikFan	just edited Red Bulborb http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Red_Bulborb&diff=166513&oldid=166372
2016-06-07 17:39:02	@PikFan	I separated the areas by game
2016-06-07 17:39:48	Marty2000	I see, that's cool
2016-06-07 17:40:00	@PikFan	wonder how Espyo will feel about it

2016-06-07 18:50:00	Marty2000	Hello Espyo and Testyo.
2016-06-07 18:50:00	Testyo	So understandably the estimated time on the render exceeded 30 hours, and I LIVE
2016-06-07 18:50:53	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-06-07 18:50:53	Testyo	I'm not familiar with that topic, so I'd probably have to normal

2016-06-07 19:07:52	Yoshi2	if I tried to be annoying like that it would just be cringy
2016-06-07 19:08:11	Yoshi2	and live commentary doesn't work well with my recording method
2016-06-07 19:08:39	Neocraftz1553	gtg, I might be on later

2016-06-07 19:12:03	@Espyo	the dis/mounting thing
2016-06-07 19:13:07	Yoshi2	feels like a left-over artifact from when entering vehicles was an official part of the game
2016-06-07 19:13:13	@Espyo	yeah

2016-06-07 19:50:17	Marty2000	Hmm... the Pikmin flowers are a bit glitchy, though
2016-06-07 19:50:44	@Espyo	oh yeah, now that you mention it
2016-06-07 19:50:47	@Espyo	probably another code's doing
2016-06-07 19:50:48	@Espyo	or your emulator
2016-06-07 19:51:03	Marty2000	Yeah, they even become pink
2016-06-07 19:51:07	Marty2000	I think that's a code

2016-06-07 19:51:42	Yoshi2	in battalion wars there was an issue that only caused a crash for me on a newer version of dolphin :|
2016-06-07 19:51:58	Yoshi2	basically, one object was referencing another object that I deleted, but that only crashed on the newer version of dolphin
2016-06-07 19:52:29	@Espyo	yeah, I'm starting to think newer versions of Dolphin are more prone to crashing when the game crashes
2016-06-07 19:52:43	@Espyo	while I was messing with the lighting, if on format version 0001 you don't specify both lighting conditions, the game crashes
2016-06-07 19:52:46	@Espyo	and down goes Dolphin with it
2016-06-07 19:54:19	CreativeSushi	I live
2016-06-07 19:54:26	Marty2000	Welcome back
2016-06-07 19:54:33	@Espyo	hey
2016-06-07 19:54:57	CreativeSushi	heyo. So anything you guys think the forums need?
2016-06-07 19:55:21	CreativeSushi	Also I'm concidering merging general discussion and Pikmin theories
2016-06-07 19:55:37	CreativeSushi	because there have been a lot of arguements in the skype group with which topics go where
2016-06-07 19:55:51	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-07 19:56:01	@Espyo	well, what did the skype folk say about a merge?
2016-06-07 19:57:04	CreativeSushi	I got various replies 
2016-06-07 19:57:10	CreativeSushi	nobody rejected the idea
2016-06-07 19:57:17	CreativeSushi	pretty much in the air
2016-06-07 19:57:30	@Espyo	well, I think it can be merged
2016-06-07 19:57:34	@Espyo	the line IS pretty blurry
2016-06-07 19:57:38	CreativeSushi	getting answers out of those people is difficult sometimes 
2016-06-07 19:57:44	CreativeSushi	it is, yes
2016-06-07 19:57:45	@Espyo	some theories are just crazy stuff
2016-06-07 19:57:56	@Espyo	others are discussing canon facts and pointing out similarities and such
2016-06-07 19:58:05	CreativeSushi	well its not so much that but
2016-06-07 19:58:07	@Espyo	plus not like we'll have a trillion threads
2016-06-07 19:58:16	@Espyo	it'd be nice, but Pikmin is too niche
2016-06-07 19:58:34	@Espyo	so we don't need to worry TOO much about splitting the boards into several sub-boards
2016-06-07 19:58:34	CreativeSushi	when luther posted his theory he argued that it wasn't a theory but a discussion
2016-06-07 19:58:49	CreativeSushi	which it was a discussion, but thats why pikmin theories are in the discussion tab
2016-06-07 19:58:52	CreativeSushi	but its also a theory
2016-06-07 19:59:04	CreativeSushi	but yeah your right
2016-06-07 19:59:15	@Espyo	yeah, it's blurry
2016-06-07 19:59:33	@Espyo	I remember hearing about that episode here and there
2016-06-07 19:59:40	@Espyo	it was a bit rough for everybody, with all the fighting about where it should go
2016-06-07 19:59:53	@Espyo	next time, try to take it to a third party to help solve those problems, all right?
2016-06-07 20:00:20	CreativeSushi	what do you mean exactly? we were discussing it in the group chat during a call if thats what you mean
2016-06-07 20:00:27	CreativeSushi	it wasn't just me and luther
2016-06-07 20:00:38	@Espyo	I think I've heard that the discussion got really heated
2016-06-07 20:01:58	CreativeSushi	what do you mean exactly by taking it to a third party?
2016-06-07 20:02:26	@Espyo	well, checking out here, too
2016-06-07 20:02:47	@Espyo	when one person thinks something should be done in X way, but another thinks Y
2016-06-07 20:02:51	@Espyo	much like you and Luther
2016-06-07 20:02:57	@Espyo	and neither's really willing to wield
2016-06-07 20:03:07	@Espyo	it's pretty hard to reach a conclusion, right?
2016-06-07 20:03:11	@Espyo	I know others were there talking too
2016-06-07 20:03:26	@Espyo	but it looked like everybody was just saying X or Y, and wanting that no matter what
2016-06-07 20:03:33	@Espyo	if you brought it here, we could help decide
2016-06-07 20:03:41	CreativeSushi	Well, I did bring it to tommy, josh, jordan, ect. I didn't want to make a post about it on the forums because it would have been long, tedious, and hard when the chat isn't live, but I didn't think about bringing it here.
2016-06-07 20:03:45	@Espyo	since we weren't in the debate, we wouldn't be STRONGLY suggesting X or Y
2016-06-07 20:03:48	@Espyo	we'd just give our opinion
2016-06-07 20:03:52	CreativeSushi	True 
2016-06-07 20:03:55	@Espyo	which would definitely help reach a conclusion
2016-06-07 20:04:13	@Espyo	as long as the timezones match, we're always here
2016-06-07 20:04:37	@Espyo	yeah, making a big fuss out of it would just be worse
2016-06-07 20:05:02	CreativeSushi	I find it hard to remember this chat exist sometimes. It isn't popping up on my computer all the time like skype or discord is. I have been able to a lot more lately since I'm working on the forums so much and its right up there
2016-06-07 20:05:23	CreativeSushi	No offence to the people in this chat, I always enjoy it when I'm heree

2016-06-07 20:06:00	@Espyo	no offence taken
2016-06-07 20:06:05	@Espyo	in a way, I like that this chat is a bit quieter
2016-06-07 20:06:12	CreativeSushi	yeah me too
2016-06-07 20:06:23	@Espyo	could you imagine having a lot of kiddies just talking about what their favorite Pikmin type is over and over?
2016-06-07 20:06:37	CreativeSushi	Quieter AND not arguing all the time 
2016-06-07 20:06:38	@Espyo	and coming up with insane ideas of how there should be a Mega Pikmin that's super-powerful
2016-06-07 20:06:41	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-06-07 20:06:43	@Espyo	never quite thought about it
2016-06-07 20:06:47	@Espyo	but there's no arguing here
2016-06-07 20:07:33	CreativeSushi	yeah, and quite honestly the people here are much more fanatic over pikmin then the skype group
2016-06-07 20:07:51	CreativeSushi	put way more time into it
2016-06-07 20:08:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-07 20:08:26	@Espyo	but then, I guess this chat's also really Pikmin-centric
2016-06-07 20:08:33	@Espyo	and the skype call kinda isn't
2016-06-07 20:08:38	@Espyo	it's more like a friends' group than a Pikmin chat
2016-06-07 20:08:43	CreativeSushi	Right
2016-06-07 20:08:52	CreativeSushi	and I'm fine with that but
2016-06-07 20:08:58	CreativeSushi	thats not why I joined it orginally 
2016-06-07 20:09:00	Marty2000	" I guess this chat's also really Pikmin-centric" I can tell you that's true for me. I talk about Pikmin most of the time ;)
2016-06-07 20:09:15	@Espyo	heh, yep
2016-06-07 20:09:24	@Espyo	not that we HAVE to
2016-06-07 20:09:35	@Espyo	but there's not many people around as-is, so talking about other stuff normally doesn't get far
2016-06-07 20:09:40	@Espyo	but we do every once in a while
2016-06-07 20:10:04	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-07 20:10:19	CreativeSushi	I mean, I'm friends with everyone there, I'm going to meet tommy, luther, and josh in person later this month, but when I originally contacted tommy through youtube if I could join the group it was because I wanted to be a part of the pikmin community
2016-06-07 20:10:30	@Espyo	right
2016-06-07 20:10:38	@Espyo	oh, and meeting up is AWESOME
2016-06-07 20:10:45	CreativeSushi	Which is also why I made the forums, to try to bring the community together more since the skype group wasn't doin it for me
2016-06-07 20:10:59	@Espyo	met up with some online friends in the UK two years ago for the first time
2016-06-07 20:11:05	@Espyo	easily one of the best weeks of my life
2016-06-07 20:11:07	CreativeSushi	Sweet!
2016-06-07 20:11:09	@Espyo	did it again just a month ago
2016-06-07 20:11:10	@Espyo	cool stuff
2016-06-07 20:11:15	@Espyo	you'll like it, believe me
2016-06-07 20:11:15	CreativeSushi	Thats awesome 
2016-06-07 20:11:20	CreativeSushi	I'm sure
2016-06-07 20:11:29	CreativeSushi	I just wish my mother wouldn't be worried sick about me
2016-06-07 20:11:34	@Espyo	yeah, the forums really helps joining everybody
2016-06-07 20:11:44	@Espyo	kinda sucks that reddit is KIND of a rival... but it's not that big of a deal
2016-06-07 20:11:51	@Espyo	oh, yeah, mothers do that
2016-06-07 20:12:02	@Espyo	mine nearly took my head off when I didn't phone her the second I landed in the UK
2016-06-07 20:12:09	CreativeSushi	I tried bringing the reddit people over but they didn't seem to like the idea
2016-06-07 20:12:15	@Espyo	yeah, I remember
2016-06-07 20:12:18	@Espyo	that's the thing with reddit, though
2016-06-07 20:12:22	@Espyo	it's very polarized
2016-06-07 20:12:31	@Espyo	either everybody hates something, or everybody loves something
2016-06-07 20:12:33	@Espyo	there's no middle-ground
2016-06-07 20:12:36	@Espyo	but I wouldn't worry much
2016-06-07 20:12:50	@Espyo	most of the people on the Pikmin subreddit are like casual fans
2016-06-07 20:13:00	CreativeSushi	Well with reddit its like "Oh, I know what reddit is because I love watching some tv show that has a subreddit, I also like pikmin, I wonder if theres a pikmin subreddit"
2016-06-07 20:13:03	@Espyo	they only care about seeing some cool fanart or some news about a new game
2016-06-07 20:13:05	CreativeSushi	and we don't really get that
2016-06-07 20:13:06	@Espyo	not so much to talk about the series
2016-06-07 20:13:16	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-06-07 20:13:31	CreativeSushi	and your very right but, I wish some of those people who MAKE the fanart and stuff would come over here
2016-06-07 20:13:41	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-07 20:13:52	CreativeSushi	granted, because of that thing I said with people casually using reddit, its great for promoting your stuff
2016-06-07 20:13:53	@Espyo	but then again, I guess it's the same thing, huh
2016-06-07 20:14:00	@Espyo	people who make fanart are just casual fans of the series
2016-06-07 20:14:02	@Espyo	most of the time
2016-06-07 20:14:13	@Espyo	they just want to draw something, and remembered that Winged Pikmin are adorable, and boom
2016-06-07 20:14:24	@Espyo	but they're not really into talking into detail about a game they haven't played in 3 years
2016-06-07 20:14:29	CreativeSushi	I always put my stuff on reddit because it gives me 10x and many views
2016-06-07 20:14:34	@Espyo	yeah, that's true
2016-06-07 20:14:37	@Espyo	well... WHEN it works
2016-06-07 20:14:41	CreativeSushi	yeah
2016-06-07 20:14:52	@Espyo	like I said, everybody loves it, and it gets like 1265 upvotes, or everybody hates it
2016-06-07 20:14:53	CreativeSushi	So I mean, i'm not really helping the problem but
2016-06-07 20:14:58	CreativeSushi	right
2016-06-07 20:15:03	@Espyo	don't worry about it, there's not much that can be done
2016-06-07 20:15:26	@Espyo	I gotta admit, although it'd be nice to have communities with a lot of users speaking about the games and making discoveries and such
2016-06-07 20:15:36	@Espyo	the fact that we already got a good number of people, and everything is so organized already makes me happy
2016-06-07 20:15:43	@Espyo	but I guess that's relative, huh
2016-06-07 20:15:47	@Espyo	I mean, we know how it USED to be
2016-06-07 20:15:49	@Espyo	and we know how it IS
2016-06-07 20:15:55	@Espyo	so by comparison, we're in heaven now
2016-06-07 20:16:26	CreativeSushi	yeah it is nice
2016-06-07 20:16:33	CreativeSushi	but from the forum perspective 
2016-06-07 20:16:50	CreativeSushi	things slow down
2016-06-07 20:16:59	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-07 20:17:03	@Espyo	though, there's one good thing
2016-06-07 20:17:04	@Espyo	Pikmin 4
2016-06-07 20:17:09	@Espyo	things WILL change after it
2016-06-07 20:17:12	CreativeSushi	people post less stuff because we have few people and they can't create things constantly
2016-06-07 20:17:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-07 20:17:27	CreativeSushi	heck I'm sure that the forums being created gave some people a reason to create more
2016-06-07 20:17:32	CreativeSushi	but then the hype dies down
2016-06-07 20:17:35	@Espyo	very true
2016-06-07 20:17:39	CreativeSushi	people who get on don't see as much stuff
2016-06-07 20:17:46	Yoshi2	mario maker hype is dying down
2016-06-07 20:17:49	@Espyo	but even still, the forum's holding its weight
2016-06-07 20:17:53	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-07 20:17:57	CreativeSushi	and then they stop getting on because they don't see anything new
2016-06-07 20:18:09	CreativeSushi	thats what I'm scared of anyway
2016-06-07 20:18:17	@Espyo	well, I'm doing my part :P
2016-06-07 20:18:22	CreativeSushi	yeah you are
2016-06-07 20:18:22	@Espyo	tapping away at the engine while alt+tabbing to talk here
2016-06-07 20:18:41	CreativeSushi	I have some things I'll be working on shortly and uploading
2016-06-07 20:18:45	@Espyo	gaah, this laptop is SO GOOD for this
2016-06-07 20:18:46	CreativeSushi	videos 
2016-06-07 20:18:50	Yoshi2	I'm currently doing the opposite with that battalion wars community I'm part of
2016-06-07 20:18:51	CreativeSushi	XD 
2016-06-07 20:18:52	@Espyo	it's so fast, and the screen resolution is so not-crap
2016-06-07 20:18:57	@Espyo	that I can just do stuff so quickly
2016-06-07 20:19:01	@Espyo	talking and coding is so eays
2016-06-07 20:19:03	@Espyo	*easy
2016-06-07 20:19:05	@Espyo	I love it
2016-06-07 20:19:38	Yoshi2	because the community is basically non-existant and nobody else is doing stuff, me and 1-2 others are making stuff to breathe life into it
2016-06-07 20:19:55	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-07 20:20:27	CreativeSushi	OH Espyo
2016-06-07 20:20:31	CreativeSushi	did you see the favicon?
2016-06-07 20:20:32	@Espyo	mhm?
2016-06-07 20:20:36	CreativeSushi	for the forums?
2016-06-07 20:20:39	@Espyo	uhm, don't think I did
2016-06-07 20:20:48	@Espyo	oh, I do now
2016-06-07 20:20:53	CreativeSushi	What do you think?
2016-06-07 20:20:57	@Espyo	hmmmmm... the greenness on it kinda throws me off
2016-06-07 20:21:06	@Espyo	like, the background
2016-06-07 20:21:16	CreativeSushi	Ok
2016-06-07 20:21:18	@Espyo	plus it being a strawberry is kinda non-Pikminish
2016-06-07 20:21:23	@Espyo	but still, it's not ba
2016-06-07 20:21:24	@Espyo	*bad
2016-06-07 20:21:27	CreativeSushi	oh really? ok
2016-06-07 20:21:32	@Espyo	I wouldn't mind if it stayed as this
2016-06-07 20:21:36	CreativeSushi	I didn't like the straberry either. its too detailed
2016-06-07 20:21:38	@Espyo	but if we can get a better idea, that'd be better
2016-06-07 20:21:45	@Espyo	yeah, you can't tell right away what it is
2016-06-07 20:21:51	@Espyo	we could just go with the classic Pikmin flower
2016-06-07 20:21:54	@Espyo	but the wiki already has that
2016-06-07 20:22:02	CreativeSushi	Unfortunately Proboards doesn't allow png so no transparency 
2016-06-07 20:22:10	CreativeSushi	it has to be square
2016-06-07 20:22:15	@Espyo	wow, that sucks
2016-06-07 20:22:18	CreativeSushi	yeah
2016-06-07 20:22:42	CreativeSushi	quite honestly though
2016-06-07 20:22:55	CreativeSushi	I think you should change the favicon on the forums

2016-06-07 20:24:13	@Espyo	I like that idea
2016-06-07 20:24:21	@Espyo	I'll make a mockup
2016-06-07 20:24:23	CreativeSushi	I have the file, I can send it to you
2016-06-07 20:24:25	@Espyo	and then post it online
2016-06-07 20:24:32	@Espyo	without the "PIKIPEDIA" text?
2016-06-07 20:24:35	CreativeSushi	yup
2016-06-07 20:24:39	@Espyo	sure
2016-06-07 20:24:43	@Espyo	oh, but I'll have to turn on skype
2016-06-07 20:24:45	@Espyo	which is a slog
2016-06-07 20:24:47	CreativeSushi	I'll skype it
2016-06-07 20:24:57	CreativeSushi	or imgur host it 
2016-06-07 20:24:57	@Espyo	don't we have that somewhere on the wiki?
2016-06-07 20:25:02	@Espyo	I think on this page: [[Pikipedia:About]]
2016-06-07 20:25:02	Testyo	"Pikipedia:About" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:About
2016-06-07 20:25:13	@Espyo	ah, there it is
2016-06-07 20:25:20	@Espyo	on the "Logo history" section
2016-06-07 20:25:22	CreativeSushi	I have one thats smaller and An ICO file though
2016-06-07 20:25:25	@Espyo	is that the one you're on about, the second one?
2016-06-07 20:25:27	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-07 20:25:30	CreativeSushi	yes
2016-06-07 20:25:36	CreativeSushi	I mena, I have png
2016-06-07 20:25:38	CreativeSushi	excuse me
2016-06-07 20:25:40	CreativeSushi	but its smaller
2016-06-07 20:25:40	@Espyo	well, it doesn't need to be an ICO
2016-06-07 20:25:41	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-07 20:25:45	@Espyo	I can resize it and do it here, no worries
2016-06-07 20:25:46	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-07 20:25:54	CreativeSushi	alright

2016-06-07 20:26:17	CreativeSushi	I'm about to stab my mouse
2016-06-07 20:26:31	@Espyo	ye
2016-06-07 20:26:44	CreativeSushi	Would a marble be better?
2016-06-07 20:26:49	CreativeSushi	pikmin 3 marble?
2016-06-07 20:27:02	@Espyo	eh, probably not recognizable enough
2016-06-07 20:27:12	CreativeSushi	or maybe, I could do the same one your doing
2016-06-07 20:27:17	CreativeSushi	but add an F for forums
2016-06-07 20:27:21	@Espyo	might be too cluttered
2016-06-07 20:27:24	@Espyo	we can try
2016-06-07 20:27:35	CreativeSushi	well, it will have a background too 
2016-06-07 20:27:50	@Espyo	oh, what about a silhouette of a buried Red Pikmin?
2016-06-07 20:27:53	@Espyo	just the stem
2016-06-07 20:27:58	CreativeSushi	Oh I can do that
2016-06-07 20:28:14	CreativeSushi	should it be the same green color?
2016-06-07 20:28:28	@Espyo	what, the background?
2016-06-07 20:28:42	CreativeSushi	well you said a silhouette 
2016-06-07 20:28:53	CreativeSushi	I men of the stem
2016-06-07 20:28:56	CreativeSushi	*mean
2016-06-07 20:29:01	@Espyo	yeah, but if it's a silhouette of a Red Pikmin, it should be red, imo
2016-06-07 20:29:07	@Espyo	or maybe a gradient...
2016-06-07 20:29:15	@Espyo	red on the stem itself, green on the leaf
2016-06-07 20:29:25	@Espyo	I was thinking the entire thing, leaf included, in red
2016-06-07 20:29:27	@Espyo	who knows
2016-06-07 20:29:32	@Espyo	either one can work
2016-06-07 20:29:34	@Espyo	we'll have to see
2016-06-07 20:31:55	@Espyo	uh, that old logo we had, with no text, is really blurry up close
2016-06-07 20:31:58	@Espyo	I have an idea
2016-06-07 20:32:09	@Espyo	http://www.ssbwiki.com/images/6/61/PikminSymbol.svg
2016-06-07 20:32:56	CreativeSushi	http://i.imgur.com/jJMBFlu.png
2016-06-07 20:33:03	CreativeSushi	this one is better up close
2016-06-07 20:33:07	Marty2000	If it can inspire you... I remember seeing, on a French Pikmin forum (completely dead today), a mouse cursor that was actually a Pikmin seed whzen you entered said forum...

2016-06-07 20:38:26	@Espyo	thoughts?
2016-06-07 20:39:03	CreativeSushi	Looks great to me
2016-06-07 20:39:20	Marty2000	Same
2016-06-07 20:39:31	@Espyo	to me, it looks like it's hard to recognize that it's a flower
2016-06-07 20:39:34	@Espyo	unless you already know that it is
2016-06-07 20:39:45	@Espyo	I added some of the white glow we have on our logo
2016-06-07 20:39:50	@Espyo	so that helps make it a bit fancier
2016-06-07 20:39:55	CreativeSushi	https://i.gyazo.com/49ea7dcc28edfae807be8bf0b609f290.png
2016-06-07 20:40:00	CreativeSushi	made this
2016-06-07 20:40:01	@Espyo	CreativeSushi: can you share it with the guys on skype?
2016-06-07 20:40:09	@Espyo	ooh, I like it
2016-06-07 20:40:10	Marty2000	Cool one too!
2016-06-07 20:40:24	@Espyo	but you'll have to mess with the proportions a bit
2016-06-07 20:40:28	@Espyo	because as a 16x16 favicon, it looks off
2016-06-07 20:41:40	CreativeSushi	Yeah...
2016-06-07 20:41:48	CreativeSushi	Ok I'll share that
2016-06-07 20:42:36	@Espyo	if I open an image with Firefox, it automatically changes the tab's favicon to that image
2016-06-07 20:42:39	@Espyo	so it's a great way to preview
2016-06-07 20:42:44	@Espyo	don't think Chrome does that though
2016-06-07 20:43:00	CreativeSushi	thats a pretty cool feature
2016-06-07 20:45:47	CreativeSushi	change the favicon on the forums again take a look
2016-06-07 20:46:26	CreativeSushi	*changed
2016-06-07 20:46:41	@Espyo	ooh, I like it
2016-06-07 20:46:46	@Espyo	but the white might be a bit too abrasive
2016-06-07 20:46:58	@Espyo	I'm trying to think of some color we can use instead of the white for the background
2016-06-07 20:47:03	@Espyo	something that's a bit easier on the eyes
2016-06-07 20:47:07	@Espyo	and not so 2002y
2016-06-07 20:47:41	@Espyo	a really bright sky blue?
2016-06-07 20:47:50	@Espyo	it might clash with the green in a bad way
2016-06-07 20:47:53	@Espyo	but it's worth a try
2016-06-07 20:48:52	CreativeSushi	I'll try
2016-06-07 20:49:25	CreativeSushi	Josh said your icon looks fine but he said it may need to be "2 pixels higher"
2016-06-07 20:50:08	@Espyo	higher?
2016-06-07 20:50:12	@Espyo	well, it's already taking up all the space it can
2016-06-07 20:50:13	@Espyo	it can't move
2016-06-07 20:51:09	CreativeSushi	im not sure what he meant either
2016-06-07 20:51:21	@Espyo	I guess I'll hop on skype then
2016-06-07 20:51:53	@Espyo	ugh, I hate how it loads a million missed messages at once
2016-06-07 20:52:00	@Espyo	well, not at once, that's the problem
2016-06-07 20:52:03	CreativeSushi	yeah...
2016-06-07 20:52:07	@Espyo	it's just spamming the corner of my screen with notifications
2016-06-07 20:57:50	CreativeSushi	Take a look at it now
2016-06-07 20:58:26	@Espyo	I can't tell if it changed
2016-06-07 20:59:26	CreativeSushi	its a light green
2016-06-07 20:59:41	CreativeSushi	https://i.gyazo.com/d958f8c10e9556ce012034ea0c37b0e1.png
2016-06-07 20:59:43	CreativeSushi	Thats what I see
2016-06-07 20:59:53	@Espyo	ah, so it is
2016-06-07 20:59:57	@Espyo	looks good to me
2016-06-07 21:00:09	@Espyo	maybe it could be a bit greener, though?
2016-06-07 21:00:13	@Espyo	I mean, to me, it still looked white
2016-06-07 21:00:25	@Espyo	seeing it up-close, yeah, it's green
2016-06-07 21:03:01	CreativeSushi	i can make it greener
2016-06-07 21:05:08	@Espyo	yeah, give it a try
2016-06-07 21:09:17	CreativeSushi	What do you think of the one I just put
2016-06-07 21:09:42	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-07 21:09:46	@Espyo	it has good personality
2016-06-07 21:09:50	@Espyo	and it's good on the eyes
2016-06-07 21:09:51	@Espyo	I like it
2016-06-07 21:10:28	@Espyo	for me, it can stay that one
2016-06-07 21:10:29	@Espyo	I really like it

2016-06-07 23:09:30	@Espyo	so now I just have a calm burning Pikmin
2016-06-07 23:09:43	@Espyo	http://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png basically, this
2016-06-07 23:10:10	Scruffy	Hahahahaha
2016-06-07 23:10:24	Scruffy	That's no problem, you could hopefully use that for fire hazards
2016-06-07 23:10:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-07 23:12:10	Scruffy	Today I downloaded Occupational Hazards, and went through it frame by frame checking out the animation to study it for my short movie
2016-06-07 23:13:03	@Espyo	oh, sweet!
2016-06-07 23:14:55	Scruffy	It's so great
2016-06-07 23:15:19	Scruffy	For a series with so many memorable glitches, the animation is quite flawless

2016-06-07 23:16:02	Scruffy	I did notice a few minor goofs I hadn't noticed before, but certainly nothing inexcusable
2016-06-07 23:16:07	Scruffy	Bye Marty!
2016-06-07 23:16:08	@Espyo	oh?
2016-06-07 23:16:09	@Espyo	anything new?
2016-06-07 23:16:49	Scruffy	When the White Pikmin rockets into the air off the seesaw, the smoke trail it emits begins slightly above it
2016-06-07 23:17:24	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-06-07 23:17:28	Scruffy	Also in the scene with the White Pikmin shooting poison while the other Pikmin restrain it, the crane appears to be the lower-res model meant for backgrounds
2016-06-07 23:17:46	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-06-07 23:17:55	@Espyo	these things really interest me
2016-06-07 23:18:04	@Espyo	not quite sure if they're good to add to the wiki
2016-06-07 23:18:09	@Espyo	they could just be a bit TOO specific
2016-06-07 23:18:43	Scruffy	Right right
2016-06-07 23:19:06	@Espyo	well, they can stay as fun discussion for now
2016-06-07 23:19:11	@Espyo	but maybe point them down somewhere
2016-06-07 23:19:16	@Espyo	could be useful to have them one day
2016-06-07 23:19:19	@Espyo	or at least fun to talk about
2016-06-07 23:19:27	Scruffy	There were a few inconsistencies with the mud, but when you know how devious liquid simulations can be, they're pardonable
2016-06-07 23:19:34	@Espyo	ugh, yeah
2016-06-07 23:20:04	Scruffy	And finally, I can tell that they built the Fiery Blowhog model from scratch, but built the Red Bulborb beginning with the P3 model
2016-06-07 23:20:22	@Espyo	how come?
2016-06-07 23:21:20	Scruffy	There are some things you can't hide on those models, namely when two different surfaces require two different textures
2016-06-07 23:21:38	Scruffy	I can tell they made new textures for the Fiery Blowhog, they're higher res
2016-06-07 23:21:49	Scruffy	But the facial texture of the Red Bulborb is the original
2016-06-07 23:22:08	Scruffy	And also, you can see a split between the front and back half of the Bulborb
2016-06-07 23:23:09	Scruffy	it's very slight, but it's because the normal texture for the face and the normal texture for the spots are not seamless with each other
2016-06-07 23:24:05	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-06-07 23:24:09	Yoshi2|offline	good night
2016-06-07 23:24:18	Scruffy	night Yoshi2
2016-06-07 23:24:41	Scruffy	But yeah, that split existed in the game too
2016-06-07 23:24:51	Scruffy	I had the same trouble rendering the model in Blender
2016-06-07 23:25:06	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-07 23:25:28	Scruffy	Again though, it's excusable, it's barely noticeable, and no one's really ever going to care but nit-pickers like us
2016-06-07 23:25:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-07 23:26:07	Scruffy	And otherwise the motions are so well-animated, the materials are amazing, and the /details/ are just breathtaking
2016-06-07 23:26:44	Scruffy	Also, I had never noticed that the Red Pikmin who kicks the bulborb's eye actually digs /into/ the eye

2016-06-08 00:10:02	Scruffy	Although it'd be cool if you could have the game icons there, I think that's how it is in other parts of infoboxes

2016-06-08 00:10:26	CreativeSushi	You think so?
2016-06-08 00:10:35	@Espyo	not bad, but we still need to decide how to organize area locations at a grand scale
2016-06-08 00:10:37	@Espyo	like
2016-06-08 00:10:48	@Espyo	an old idea was to list all locations in more or less detail in a /locations subpage
2016-06-08 00:10:55	@Espyo	for the Red Bulborb, Yellow Wollywog, whatever
2016-06-08 00:11:01	CreativeSushi	I'm workin on the coloring of it
2016-06-08 00:11:06	@Espyo	and then the infobox wouldn't need the locations

2016-06-08 00:14:07	@Espyo	or we could have the detailed locations AND the infobox

2016-06-08 00:14:12	@Espyo	we need to discuss

2016-06-08 00:17:17	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-08 00:17:32	@PikFan	well, that's too bad
2016-06-08 00:17:45	Scruffy	Specifically, I can understand what everything is in the real world, but not how it's programmed in the Pikmin world
2016-06-08 00:17:46	@PikFan	it looked like an interesting potential article
2016-06-08 00:18:17	Scruffy	And since it's a more technical article, that's important; otherwise it's sort of just speculation into how the world is composed

2016-06-08 00:35:30	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-08 00:37:48	Scruffy	I keep wanting to clean up some of the grammar on Fanon articles, but I'm worried I'll change too much by doing so
2016-06-08 00:38:01	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-08 00:38:05	@PikFan	like what grammar?
2016-06-08 00:38:15	@PikFan	correction: on what articles?
2016-06-08 00:38:24	Scruffy	Well, this isn't necessarily a grammar correction
2016-06-08 00:38:50	Scruffy	But I just accidentally clicked "Random page" and it brought me to Pikmin 4 (Wii U)
2016-06-08 00:38:58	Scruffy	And I noticed the term Koppaians

2016-06-08 00:39:08	@PikFan	yeaaaahhhhhh........
2016-06-08 00:39:21	Scruffy	but I've noticed some other things that could just be said more concisely
2016-06-08 00:39:25	@PikFan	that's no good; fans should know what the proper plural is :x
2016-06-08 00:39:40	@PikFan	such as?
2016-06-08 00:40:31	Scruffy	Green Spectralids are Spectralids that have a green coloration in their wings
2016-06-08 00:40:43	Scruffy	Green Spectralids are Spectralids with green wings

2016-06-08 00:41:18	@PikFan	I really doubt that the other users will mind, though
2016-06-08 00:41:26	@PikFan	if you keep the ideas the same it should be alright
2016-06-08 00:41:30	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-08 00:41:45	Scruffy	I still don't know what to do when it comes to enemies though
2016-06-08 00:41:56	@PikFan	what do you mean?
2016-06-08 00:42:39	Scruffy	Because once I start thinking of a little mistake to correct I wonder about how to structure the article
2016-06-08 00:43:04	Scruffy	I still don't know which way would be best

2016-06-08 00:45:30	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-08 00:45:35	-->	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-08 00:45:52	Scruffy	Like
2016-06-08 00:45:56	Scruffy	Look at this article
2016-06-08 00:46:00	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Burrowing_Snagret
2016-06-08 00:46:30	Scruffy	It's nice to have an infobox right at the top to get an idea of the enemy
2016-06-08 00:46:43	Scruffy	But because this enemy occurs in more than one game, that may not capture every enemy
2016-06-08 00:46:48	Scruffy	So I don't know what to do there
2016-06-08 00:47:04	Scruffy	er, I don't know what to do with that infobox
2016-06-08 00:47:11	@PikFan	"may not capture every enemy"? huh?
2016-06-08 00:47:30	@PikFan	like, each version of the enemy?
2016-06-08 00:47:36	Scruffy	That infobox may not represent every version of that enemy
2016-06-08 00:47:37	Scruffy	Rigth
2016-06-08 00:47:48	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-06-08 00:48:23	Scruffy	But if we get rid of it, you have to scroll down to get the look and info of it
2016-06-08 00:49:00	Scruffy	Which I guess isn't bad
2016-06-08 00:49:23	Scruffy	But I don't know how else to organize everyone's different versions of the enemy
2016-06-08 00:49:38	Scruffy	Especially when not all the info is provided per game
2016-06-08 00:50:34	@PikFan	well
2016-06-08 00:51:04	Scruffy	But then there's the proposal's method, which is like this
2016-06-08 00:51:05	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Red_Bulborb
2016-06-08 00:51:37	Scruffy	It feels more organized to me (especially since the headings are all Locations or Notes rather than headings about each individual game)
2016-06-08 00:52:07	@PikFan	about the infobox, there was an idea to adapt Pikipedia's enemy stat template
2016-06-08 00:52:24	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-08 00:52:26	@PikFan	since Fanon infoboxes are likely to have many more stats than Pikipedia infoboxes
2016-06-08 00:52:34	@PikFan	and thus be way longer
2016-06-08 00:52:40	Scruffy	Right, but not all enemies
2016-06-08 00:52:48	@PikFan	right
2016-06-08 00:52:54	@PikFan	I mean like the common enemies
2016-06-08 00:53:13	@PikFan	I need to get back to Espyo about that
2016-06-08 00:53:41	Scruffy	And I've had a question for you about this, actually
2016-06-08 00:53:51	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-06-08 00:53:57	Scruffy	You prefer the Red Bulborb's organization to the Burrowing Snagret's, right?
2016-06-08 00:54:05	Scruffy	Or do you have an alternate?
2016-06-08 00:54:21	Scruffy	I mean the organization of these two articles
2016-06-08 00:54:50	@PikFan	I kind of support the Red Bulborb's organization
2016-06-08 00:54:59	@PikFan	because while yes, it's structured
2016-06-08 00:55:10	@PikFan	it doesn't really allow room for uniqueness
2016-06-08 00:55:35	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-08 00:55:59	Scruffy	But converting this into separate articles for each game wouldn't solve that
2016-06-08 00:56:11	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-06-08 00:56:37	@PikFan	it's a conundrum
2016-06-08 00:56:38	Scruffy	So I had an idea
2016-06-08 00:56:55	Scruffy	If it's possible with MediaWiki
2016-06-08 00:57:12	Scruffy	We could have collapsible headings
2016-06-08 00:57:38	Scruffy	One for General info, the kind you'd see across games
2016-06-08 00:57:44	@PikFan	mhm?
2016-06-08 00:57:54	Scruffy	And then headings for each game that start hidden and you can click to reveal them and read more
2016-06-08 00:57:56	@PikFan	I mean, you can collapse as many things as you want
2016-06-08 00:58:07	Scruffy	They'd each have a /similar/ structure
2016-06-08 00:58:10	@PikFan	Wikipedia does that on mobile
2016-06-08 00:58:20	@PikFan	so yeah, it's possible
2016-06-08 00:58:29	Scruffy	All would have enemy stats, and extra notes
2016-06-08 00:58:36	Scruffy	Some could have specific galleries
2016-06-08 00:58:46	Scruffy	But they'd all be formatted the same way, whatever that is
2016-06-08 00:58:56	Scruffy	That allows creativity, but most of all it cleans up the page
2016-06-08 00:59:05	@PikFan	so this is a combination of the Burrowing Snagret and Red Bulborb?
2016-06-08 00:59:09	Scruffy	Yes
2016-06-08 00:59:13	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-08 00:59:28	Scruffy	But the important part is it's hideable
2016-06-08 00:59:32	@PikFan	would there be one large stats box, or one on a pergame basis?
2016-06-08 00:59:41	Scruffy	So that you can easily find and click the game you want
2016-06-08 00:59:49	Scruffy	I think a per-game basis
2016-06-08 00:59:57	Scruffy	We really don't need the canon stats
2016-06-08 01:00:02	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-06-08 01:00:15	Scruffy	Just a picture and some rudimentary info on it
2016-06-08 01:00:20	Scruffy	What it is, what it does
2016-06-08 01:01:16	Scruffy	And then instead of a big "in fan games" heading with a bramble patch of games underneath, we have collapsible mini-articles for each game
2016-06-08 01:01:52	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-08 01:01:53	Scruffy	with their extra notes, stats, and photos
2016-06-08 01:02:02	Scruffy	Like a filing cabinet, sort of
2016-06-08 01:02:10	Scruffy	Where one cabinet is "Red Bulborb"
2016-06-08 01:02:34	Scruffy	and you can easily see a label of each game until you find the one you want, and open that one
2016-06-08 01:03:04	Scruffy	that reduces the height of the article while organizing all the information into a recognizable format
2016-06-08 01:03:40	@PikFan	yes
2016-06-08 01:04:07	@PikFan	write these ideas down somewhere so we don't forget them
2016-06-08 01:06:33	Scruffy	Writing them now
2016-06-08 01:10:39	Scruffy	The only problem with this format is when we have an enemy that only occurs in one game
2016-06-08 01:11:10	Scruffy	But I think that problem could be solved if such articles were still formatted the same way
2016-06-08 01:11:32	Scruffy	With general info and a picture (and infobox) at the top, and stats, info, notes, and gallery below
2016-06-08 01:12:22	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-08 01:12:25	Scruffy	People who read the multi-game articles would be attuned to the format, so a single-game article like this would be easy to read
2016-06-08 01:12:37	Scruffy	I've written it down just in case
2016-06-08 01:12:43	@PikFan	it won't have to be restructured later if someone else wants to use it in their game
2016-06-08 01:13:07	Scruffy	right, instead you just put it all under a heading called "in Pikmin: Example"
2016-06-08 01:13:30	Scruffy	And then change the general info at the top to fit all games
2016-06-08 01:15:14	Scruffy	As long as this format is all collapsible, I feel it can work
2016-06-08 01:15:34	Scruffy	If it's not collapsible, readers will have a hard time finding the specific game they want to read
2016-06-08 01:15:45	@PikFan	like I said, the sections are collapsible on Wikipedia's mobile version
2016-06-08 01:15:55	@PikFan	so there should be a way
2016-06-08 01:15:59	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-08 01:16:19	Scruffy	But also, if someone follows a link from another page, they'd want that section to be already open to read
2016-06-08 01:16:28	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-08 01:16:38	Scruffy	I agree there must be a way, I just hope it's the right way in all situations
2016-06-08 01:16:52	Scruffy	Anyway, that's my proposal
2016-06-08 01:17:13	Scruffy	Sorry, I actually have to get going
2016-06-08 01:17:20	Scruffy	Will you be on tomorrow
2016-06-08 01:17:22	Scruffy	?
2016-06-08 01:17:57	@PikFan	yeah, probably
2016-06-08 01:18:04	Scruffy	Okay
2016-06-08 01:18:10	@PikFan	can you give me a pastebin of what you wrote?
2016-06-08 01:18:13	Scruffy	Yes
2016-06-08 01:18:16	@PikFan	thanks
2016-06-08 01:20:36	Scruffy	http://mibpaste.com/fDEFMN 
2016-06-08 01:21:11	@PikFan	awesome, thanks
2016-06-08 01:21:12	Scruffy	oh, I thought that was pastebin, I guess that was Mibbit's own text paster
2016-06-08 01:21:15	Scruffy	No problem!
2016-06-08 01:21:24	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-08 01:21:32	Scruffy	I'll try to be on at noon tomorrow but I don't know if I can
2016-06-08 01:21:45	@PikFan	noon your time?
2016-06-08 01:21:58	Scruffy	Uhhh
2016-06-08 01:22:32	Scruffy	noon your time
2016-06-08 01:22:37	Scruffy	which would be 3:00 for me
2016-06-08 01:22:42	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-08 01:22:47	Scruffy	i don't know if I'll be able to
2016-06-08 01:22:48	@PikFan	I'll be in class then...
2016-06-08 01:22:53	Scruffy	oh
2016-06-08 01:22:56	Scruffy	When are you on?
2016-06-08 01:23:07	@PikFan	hrmmmmmm
2016-06-08 01:23:15	@PikFan	probably around this time again tomorrow
2016-06-08 01:23:24	@PikFan	well, actually
2016-06-08 01:23:40	@PikFan	I don't even know if I'll be on tomorrow, because I have baby cousins coming over
2016-06-08 01:23:50	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-08 01:23:57	Scruffy	Heh, no problem
2016-06-08 01:24:01	Scruffy	That sounds more important
2016-06-08 01:24:14	Scruffy	I can show this to Espyo tomorrow and get his opinion
2016-06-08 01:24:22	Scruffy	I'll try to make time to be on
2016-06-08 01:24:33	@PikFan	but if I do get on, the times would be: 9:20am to 10:30 am, 12:40pm to 1:20pm, and 4:00pm to 6:00pm
2016-06-08 01:24:37	@PikFan	all my time
2016-06-08 01:24:39	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-08 01:25:11	Scruffy	I'll try to get on at those times, my time
2016-06-08 01:25:33	@PikFan	heh, alright
2016-06-08 01:25:39	@PikFan	timezones are confusing...
2016-06-08 01:25:40	Scruffy	the last one might work best for me
2016-06-08 01:25:43	Scruffy	Yeah, heh
2016-06-08 01:25:48	@PikFan	good thing it's only a three hour difference
2016-06-08 01:25:56	Scruffy	anyway, I'm sure one of us will show Espyo and then fill the other in
2016-06-08 01:26:01	@PikFan	yup
2016-06-08 01:26:05	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-06-08 01:26:07	Scruffy	Gotta go for now

2016-06-08 17:23:43	Marty2000	Hi PikFan
2016-06-08 17:23:59	Marty2000	We have a question of great importance with UltraMario

2016-06-08 17:25:41	Marty2000	It turns out it's either me or you
2016-06-08 17:25:47	Marty2000	I was in January 2000 as well
2016-06-08 17:25:50	Marty2000	But
2016-06-08 17:25:51	@PikFan	._.
2016-06-08 17:25:59	Marty2000	What day were you born on? 
2016-06-08 17:26:01	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-08 17:26:02	@PikFan	you're probably older, though
2016-06-08 17:26:03	@PikFan	23rd
2016-06-08 17:26:07	Marty2000	Oh
2016-06-08 17:26:14	Marty2000	I am, indeed
2016-06-08 17:26:27	@PikFan	what day?
2016-06-08 17:26:32	Marty2000	And you were born on the same date as one of my friend as well , heh
2016-06-08 17:26:34	Marty2000	14th
2016-06-08 17:26:37	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-08 17:26:54	@PikFan	wow, I have the same birthday as one of your friends, nice
2016-06-08 17:27:13	Marty2000	Thanks for replying, you cannot imagine how important that question was in order to keep our sanity! :)
2016-06-08 17:27:35	@PikFan	and now you shall pay the price for disturbing me
2016-06-08 17:27:37	@PikFan	kidding
2016-06-08 17:27:42	Marty2000	Yes, funny coincidence
2016-06-08 17:27:44	@PikFan	just kidding!
2016-06-08 17:27:49	Marty2000	I know, he he
2016-06-08 17:27:55	Marty2000	No worries, joking is better than not
2016-06-08 17:28:01	Marty2000	Yoshi2 will say the same
2016-06-08 17:28:52	Marty2000	Ah, by the way
2016-06-08 17:29:08	Marty2000	Have you seen the new weapons in Splatoon yet?
2016-06-08 17:29:16	Marty2000	I mean, do you know them?
2016-06-08 17:30:23	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-08 17:30:36	@PikFan	the N-Zap '83 is pretty interesting
2016-06-08 17:30:53	Marty2000	As you can imagine, I've grown to like the user-friendliness weapon called Chery H-3 Nozzlenose
2016-06-08 17:30:57	Marty2000	Yeah, they're all very interesting
2016-06-08 17:31:08	Marty2000	I prefer this Sheldon's Pick volume
2016-06-08 17:31:18	@PikFan	I still haven't ever used like 75% of the weapons in the game
2016-06-08 17:31:19	Marty2000	Cherry*
2016-06-08 17:32:03	Marty2000	I think the only weapons I haven't used are those of Sheldon's Pick vol. 1
2016-06-08 17:32:21	Marty2000	But I don't play reguarly with many weapons
2016-06-08 17:32:25	Marty2000	regularly*
2016-06-08 17:32:30	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-08 17:32:41	@PikFan	my main, as you know, is the Wasabi Splattershot
2016-06-08 17:32:52	Marty2000	Yep
2016-06-08 17:32:54	@PikFan	it used to be the Tentatek
2016-06-08 17:32:59	Marty2000	I tried it the other day
2016-06-08 17:33:03	Marty2000	It's a cool weapon
2016-06-08 17:33:06	@PikFan	but I just love the Splat Bombs and the Inkstrike
2016-06-08 17:33:10	Marty2000	But definitely not for me
2016-06-08 17:33:18	Marty2000	Yeah, that's a good combination
2016-06-08 17:33:25	Marty2000	But I think it suits offensive players better
2016-06-08 17:33:35	Marty2000	Well, you can judge better since it's your main
2016-06-08 17:33:40	Marty2000	But that's wha I feel when I use
2016-06-08 17:33:43	Marty2000	what*
2016-06-08 17:33:45	Marty2000	I use it*
2016-06-08 17:33:47	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-06-08 17:33:54	@PikFan	one of the new ones has a Bubbler and a Splash Wall
2016-06-08 17:34:01	@PikFan	that's pretty much the ultimate defense combo
2016-06-08 17:34:04	Marty2000	Yeah, that's the one I'm using! (:p)
2016-06-08 17:34:16	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-08 17:34:19	@PikFan	which one is that?
2016-06-08 17:34:25	Marty2000	I can be even more annoying that way 
2016-06-08 17:34:30	Marty2000	It's the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose
2016-06-08 17:34:36	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-08 17:34:40	Marty2000	I had difficulties using it at the start
2016-06-08 17:34:55	Marty2000	But I'm getting used to playing with it, so that's cool :)
2016-06-08 17:36:55	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-08 17:37:08	@PikFan	meanwhile, I'm cleaning up a page that was JUST created on Fanon
2016-06-08 17:37:25	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-08 17:37:31	Marty2000	What is it?
2016-06-08 17:37:57	@PikFan	Pikmin: Koppai Invasion
2016-06-08 17:38:14	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-08 17:38:19	Marty2000	I will take a look

2016-06-08 17:39:22	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-08 18:12:07	--	AFKazooie is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-06-08 18:15:52	@PikFan	surprisingly, Koppai didn't have a page on Fanon
2016-06-08 18:15:55	@PikFan	no idea why
2016-06-08 18:15:58	@PikFan	but I fixed that
2016-06-08 18:16:04	@PikFan	the problem is, it's so short...
2016-06-08 18:16:18	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-08 18:16:24	Marty2000	I'm ging to eat my dinner

2016-06-08 18:16:31	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2016-06-08 18:16:38	Marty2000	I suppose you wont be here when I come back
2016-06-08 18:16:41	Marty2000	So, see you soon!
2016-06-08 18:16:43	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-08 18:17:14	@PikFan	yeah, I've got 13 minutes left

2016-06-08 19:32:32	@Espyo	HexChat glitch
2016-06-08 19:32:36	@Espyo	pretend I said hi to Klemen702

2016-06-08 19:34:15	@Espyo	well, it wasn't a glitch
2016-06-08 19:34:18	@Espyo	pretend it was one <_<
2016-06-08 19:34:24	@Espyo	I just scrolled up and left it there, for some reason
2016-06-08 19:34:40	@Espyo	maybe my mouse wheel glitched
2016-06-08 19:34:55	Yoshi2	ugh, the guy is back again https://www.reddit.com/r/battalionwarsmod/comments/4n52he/do_you_like_battalion_wars_and_advance_wars/ 
2016-06-08 19:35:46	Yoshi2	I checked the game and it's neither close to battalion wars nor is it anywhere close to advance wars
2016-06-08 19:36:05	Scruffy	Boom Beach is from the company that created Clash of Clans
2016-06-08 19:36:38	Scruffy	Mobile gaming stuff
2016-06-08 19:37:32	Yoshi2	I see, the game did have a bit of a Clash of Clans feel
2016-06-08 19:38:50	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo! I have something important to show you
2016-06-08 19:38:59	@Espyo	oh?
2016-06-08 19:39:05	Scruffy	Yesterday PikFan and I were discussing the layout of articles on Pikmin Fanon
2016-06-08 19:39:23	Scruffy	And from scratch I sort of devised a new proposal on how articles should be organized
2016-06-08 19:39:41	Scruffy	http://mibpaste.com/J1vvQn 
2016-06-08 19:40:11	Scruffy	On Pikmin Fanon, not on Pikipedia
2016-06-08 19:40:57	@Espyo	sounds promising
2016-06-08 19:41:24	@Espyo	though the collapsible part might be a bit tricky
2016-06-08 19:41:25	Scruffy	It just requires that we can make subsections hideable
2016-06-08 19:41:28	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-08 19:41:31	@Espyo	for one thing, it likely won't work on mobile
2016-06-08 19:41:35	Scruffy	yeah
2016-06-08 19:41:37	@Espyo	and the auto-uncollapse might also be a bit of a pain
2016-06-08 19:42:04	@Espyo	plus MediaWiki might not like hideable stuff if it has like subsections insde
2016-06-08 19:42:05	@Espyo	*inside
2016-06-08 19:42:11	Scruffy	True
2016-06-08 19:42:12	@Espyo	but you can try it out on Pikipedia with {{switchable}}

2016-06-08 19:42:58	Scruffy	All right, I'll test it out in the sandbox
2016-06-08 19:44:32	Yoshi2	now if one of the other mods can come online, I'll talk to them about removing the post
2016-06-08 19:45:58	@Espyo	might as well just complain to him that it's not really related, and let it die
2016-06-08 19:46:15	Scruffy	Hm, it seems to work; you can hide sub-headings in {{switchable}}
2016-06-08 19:46:15	Testyo	"switchable" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:switchable
2016-06-08 19:46:34	Scruffy	As long as you don't have another switchable template inside, it appears to be fine
2016-06-08 19:47:41	Yoshi2	Espyo: I will complain to him anyway, just "let it die" is not a great option on a sub where a post will stay on the front page for weeks
2016-06-08 19:49:17	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-08 19:50:38	Scruffy	The only problem is, if I have a switchable template with a subheading and the subheading isn't showing currently, clicking on it in the table of contents will do nothing
2016-06-08 19:51:10	Scruffy	Is there a way to hide headings from the table of contents?
2016-06-08 19:51:28	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-08 19:51:39	@Espyo	I was thinking you could just leave the headers outside of the hideable boxes
2016-06-08 19:51:53	@Espyo	other than that, you can kinda hide it
2016-06-08 19:51:55	@Espyo	but it won't be good
2016-06-08 19:52:03	@Espyo	you can choose what level to show on the TOC
2016-06-08 19:52:07	@Espyo	so you can just limit it

2016-06-08 19:52:30	Scruffy	I see
2016-06-08 19:52:44	Scruffy	You could leave the headers outside the hideable boxes
2016-06-08 19:53:07	Scruffy	I'm just trying to go for as clean-looking an initial page as possible
2016-06-08 19:53:27	@Espyo	it'll probably still look clean
2016-06-08 19:53:36	@Espyo	I mean, even if you hide the headers in the boxes, you'll still get like 10 boxes
2016-06-08 19:53:48	@Espyo	so below the "general info" section, it's just a free-for-all
2016-06-08 19:54:06	@Espyo	so having the headers there or not won't make much of a difference

2016-06-08 19:59:03	Scruffy	It doesn't look that bad
2016-06-08 19:59:18	Scruffy	It's better than how the articles are put together currently

2016-06-08 20:06:33	CreativeSushi	that I will be posting on the forums within an hour
2016-06-08 20:06:42	CreativeSushi	I made a google chrome extension 
2016-06-08 20:06:53	Yoshi2	g00d stuff 👌👌👌 
2016-06-08 20:06:53	CreativeSushi	that redirects any pikmin wikia page to its respective pikipedia page

2016-06-08 20:07:05	Yoshi2	that's neat
2016-06-08 20:07:32	CreativeSushi	thank you.
2016-06-08 20:07:55	CreativeSushi	I'm just waiting for google to verify it

2016-06-08 20:16:41	Nvortex	h
2016-06-08 20:18:50	Scruffy	<Espyo>: namely, the template that THAT template calls
2016-06-08 20:18:59	Scruffy	Do you mean <div>?
2016-06-08 20:19:03	@Espyo	my bad, it doesn't call a template
2016-06-08 20:19:04	@Espyo	but yeah, that div
2016-06-08 20:19:20	Scruffy	What does it do exactly?
2016-06-08 20:19:26	@Espyo	you may be able to create your own template that just uses a div with the same class
2016-06-08 20:19:56	@Espyo	we have some CSS and JS that finds any div with those classes, and just changes their properties to be clickable and hideable, depending on the class
2016-06-08 20:20:08	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-08 20:20:47	@Espyo	I could swear we had stuff with a simple show/hide link...

2016-06-08 20:21:15	@Espyo	that's the one
2016-06-08 20:22:06	Scruffy	That's the sort of thing I'm looking for
2016-06-08 20:25:14	Scruffy	Heck, the spoiler section template on Pikmin Fanon could probably do the trick since you can customize the titel
2016-06-08 20:25:17	Scruffy	title*
2016-06-08 20:25:59	@Espyo	right
2016-06-08 20:26:50	Scruffy	And few pages really use that template anyhow, so that should work out
2016-06-08 20:27:06	Scruffy	I'll chat more with PikFan about it later
2016-06-08 20:27:12	Scruffy	Thanks for your help again, Espyo!
2016-06-08 20:27:17	Scruffy	Gotta go for now

2016-06-08 20:34:55	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-08 20:35:04	Marty2000	How it was forgotten
2016-06-08 20:35:09	Marty2000	So*
2016-06-08 20:35:11	Marty2000	Not how, sorry
2016-06-08 20:35:12	@Espyo	guess so
2016-06-08 20:35:22	Klemen702	wait
2016-06-08 20:35:25	Klemen702	didn't you leave
2016-06-08 20:35:32	@Espyo	I was wondering if you saw like a video of the GC version, and confirmed that it didn't have a comma
2016-06-08 20:35:36	@Espyo	Scruffy left, not Marty
2016-06-08 20:35:41	@Espyo	yeah, they both have names ending in y
2016-06-08 20:36:15	Marty2000	Isn't it miraculous, incredible?
2016-06-08 20:36:27	Marty2000	We should dedicate a wiki to names ended by -y :)
2016-06-08 20:36:57	Klemen702	and after that scruffy said seeya marty
2016-06-08 20:36:59	Klemen702	got me confused
2016-06-08 20:37:18	Marty2000	Good then
2016-06-08 20:41:34	Marty2000	Espyo: I tried the Bento Splatterscope, it's really good
2016-06-08 20:42:18	@Espyo	oh yeah, those are out now
2016-06-08 20:42:24	@Espyo	are its stats different from stock?
2016-06-08 20:42:35	Marty2000	No difference in stats
2016-06-08 20:42:47	Marty2000	My favorite out of the new weapons is the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose
2016-06-08 20:43:00	Marty2000	It was hard to master at the start
2016-06-08 20:43:10	Marty2000	But it's surprisingly cool
2016-06-08 20:43:39	Marty2000	And the Bento Splatterscope is cool, you an just throw a Splash Wall in a corner and protect yourself for a few seconds
2016-06-08 20:43:45	Marty2000	can*
2016-06-08 20:44:21	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-08 20:44:24	@Espyo	hehe, nice
2016-06-08 20:44:41	@Espyo	CreativeSushi: oh, you made the favicon a gradient?
2016-06-08 20:44:47	@Espyo	I'd say it was better without it
2016-06-08 20:44:53	@Espyo	since now you can't see the seed, only the stem and flower
2016-06-08 20:51:09	CreativeSushi	Oh really?
2016-06-08 20:51:22	@Espyo	you can just barely see it
2016-06-08 20:51:25	@Espyo	it's really jarring
2016-06-08 20:51:26	CreativeSushi	I don't know I was second guessing things 
2016-06-08 20:51:33	@Espyo	I like the gradient, but it's too strong
2016-06-08 20:51:40	@Espyo	if the part at the bottom is lighter, that'll look better, IMO
2016-06-08 20:51:50	@Espyo	also it might be completely invisible to some colorblind people
2016-06-08 20:51:52	@Espyo	(highlighting J)
2016-06-08 20:52:07	CreativeSushi	alright, I'll do some more work on it
2016-06-08 20:52:52	CreativeSushi	I also made this one https://i.gyazo.com/7aa9b7bd77470c6eb6ed5ecebc90527b.png
2016-06-08 20:53:00	CreativeSushi	not sure which I like better
2016-06-08 20:54:12	CreativeSushi	Yooo
2016-06-08 20:54:20	CreativeSushi	Just came up with one that looks really good
2016-06-08 20:54:25	CreativeSushi	imo
2016-06-08 20:54:40	CreativeSushi	https://i.gyazo.com/85583b702a3213a68d858604239f437d.png
2016-06-08 20:55:35	@Espyo	it's still a bit hard to see the stem
2016-06-08 20:55:36	@Espyo	but I like it
2016-06-08 20:55:40	@Espyo	try
2016-06-08 20:55:43	@Espyo	try purple to orange
2016-06-08 20:55:47	@Espyo	like a sunset
2016-06-08 20:55:52	@Espyo	(which kinda matches up with our background=
2016-06-08 20:55:53	@Espyo	*)

2016-06-08 20:58:50	@Espyo	better, but the colors are a bit yucky
2016-06-08 20:58:55	@Espyo	piss-yellow :/
2016-06-08 20:59:52	Klemen702	when people see yellow text on white backgrounds. it really ''pisses'' them off because they can't read
2016-06-08 21:00:05	@Espyo	yuck
2016-06-08 21:02:08	CreativeSushi	https://i.gyazo.com/09cadf45d23efe665ff2babec2df9acd.png
2016-06-08 21:02:36	@Espyo	it's getting good, but I think the green is still too hard to see
2016-06-08 21:02:40	@Espyo	maybe make the colors more pale
2016-06-08 21:02:47	@Espyo	the background colors, I mean

2016-06-08 21:05:30	@Espyo	I like it, and we discussed some ways to do the hiding part

2016-06-08 21:06:25	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-08 21:06:49	@PikFan	my idea is to do something like Wikipedia does on mobile
2016-06-08 21:06:52	CreativeSushi	fixed it

2016-06-08 21:07:19	@PikFan	but I don't know how that'd work
2016-06-08 21:07:38	@Espyo	like I said to Scruffy, you can just keep the headers and have the content hideable
2016-06-08 21:07:48	@PikFan	...that's awesome
2016-06-08 21:07:58	@Espyo	btw, CreativeSushi, I never commented on the "F" icon

2016-06-08 21:14:12	Nvortex	i said post
2016-06-08 21:14:18	Nvortex	of course i'm talking about the forums
2016-06-08 21:14:33	@Espyo	it's no secret that we don't want people to use the wikia :|

2016-06-08 21:14:42	CreativeSushi	I know, there are no pikmin wikia followers on the forums
2016-06-08 21:14:43	@PikFan	again, pointless
2016-06-08 21:14:47	@PikFan	we already have a forum
2016-06-08 21:14:52	CreativeSushi	its the Pikipedia forums for peat sake

2016-06-08 21:14:57	@PikFan	a much better forum than their trash
2016-06-08 21:15:02	Nvortex	the post can be summed to that
2016-06-08 21:15:10	@PikFan	yeah

2016-06-08 21:16:14	CreativeSushi	in fact, I was considering posting it on reddit

2016-06-08 22:03:04	Marty2000	Espyo: Yesterday (unless it was two days ago), I talked about some early versions of the caves you have in Challenge Mode. They are from the KFes demo. I tried to check if there was some information on it on TCRF, but nothing. Seems there's nothing too on Pikipedia
2016-06-08 22:03:43	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-06-08 22:03:47	Marty2000	Unless it's in unused caves on TCRF
2016-06-08 22:03:48	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure I've heard of it
2016-06-08 22:03:51	@Espyo	try the P2 talk page at TCRF
2016-06-08 22:04:04	Marty2000	but I think I've only seen earlier ones
2016-06-08 22:04:07	Marty2000	Let me check again
2016-06-08 22:04:18	@Espyo	yeah, could be on the sub-page

2016-06-08 22:51:43	Marty2000	Hey Scruffy
2016-06-08 22:51:50	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-08 22:53:16	Scruffy	When exactly is Nintendo's E3 conference? I saw Espyo's post on the forums about it and I totally forgot E3 is a thing
2016-06-08 22:53:31	Scruffy	Now I'm hyped
2016-06-08 22:53:45	@Espyo	yeah, I barely remember either
2016-06-08 22:53:48	@Espyo	it's on tuesday
2016-06-08 22:54:00	@Espyo	 5 PM on my timezone
2016-06-08 22:54:08	@Espyo	uh, it's currently almost 11 PM
2016-06-08 22:54:10	Scruffy	Tuesday, got it
2016-06-08 22:54:12	@Espyo	so make of that what you will
2016-06-08 22:54:19	Scruffy	5 PM for you would be noon for me
2016-06-08 22:54:24	@Espyo	right
2016-06-08 22:54:28	Scruffy	Awesome!
2016-06-08 22:59:37	Marty2000	I'm hyped too, however, I 'd like Pikmin to be on a console, not a mobile phone, to be honest
2016-06-08 22:59:45	Scruffy	Just got CreativeSushi's Pikmin Wikia redirector, that's pretty hilarious
2016-06-08 22:59:48	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-08 23:00:08	Scruffy	Have there been rumors that Nintendo's upcoming games might go mobile?
2016-06-08 23:00:22	Marty2000	They already said that they would make
2016-06-08 23:00:29	Marty2000	Animal Corssing and Fire Emblem for mobile
2016-06-08 23:00:34	Marty2000	Crossing*
2016-06-08 23:00:52	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-08 23:01:50	@Espyo	Fire Emblem for mobile's an interesting idea
2016-06-08 23:01:58	@Espyo	but having Fire Emblem on my 3DS is far better
2016-06-08 23:02:01	@Espyo	I'll take that any day, thanks
2016-06-08 23:02:39	Scruffy	If Nintendo is going mobile then it should make its own phone
2016-06-08 23:02:51	Scruffy	I mean that's what they normally do, right?
2016-06-08 23:03:34	@Espyo	I think they said they're doing this for normal devices now
2016-06-08 23:03:37	@Espyo	like Android and iPhone
2016-06-08 23:03:48	@Espyo	I'm not sure
2016-06-08 23:03:56	@Espyo	then again, I also thought this E3 would be only Zelda
2016-06-08 23:03:59	@Espyo	and as it turns out...

2016-06-09 16:41:44	CreativeSushi	hey guys
2016-06-09 16:41:54	Marty2000	Hi CreativeSuhi
2016-06-09 16:42:01	CreativeSushi	So remember when I posted that extension on reddit last night?
2016-06-09 16:42:05	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-09 16:42:14	CreativeSushi	this guy came on and is giving me a hard time about it
2016-06-09 16:42:20	CreativeSushi	but the guys like insane
2016-06-09 16:42:22	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-09 16:42:26	Marty2000	I see...
2016-06-09 16:42:30	CreativeSushi	and I'm not responding to him anymore
2016-06-09 16:42:34	CreativeSushi	but turns out
2016-06-09 16:42:50	CreativeSushi	the guy is Dark Lord Revan
2016-06-09 16:42:58	CreativeSushi	who originally created the wikia
2016-06-09 16:44:03	Marty2000	Oh
2016-06-09 16:44:20	CreativeSushi	https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/4n75cy/i_made_a_google_chrome_extension_that_will/
2016-06-09 16:44:25	CreativeSushi	he's like gone insane
2016-06-09 16:44:37	Marty2000	Well, I don't know much about the history before the merge... I just know why it happened, and such
2016-06-09 16:44:48	Marty2000	That's the guy who tried to revert my edit today
2016-06-09 16:45:03	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Lie_down&curid=15702&diff=166566&oldid=166552
2016-06-09 16:45:17	Marty2000	I'm going to take a look
2016-06-09 16:45:24	CreativeSushi	oh my gosh
2016-06-09 16:45:51	CreativeSushi	and he was yelling in his comment about us doing vandalism 
2016-06-09 16:49:55	Marty2000	I see... It's my opinion, but he could speak correclty without yelling and posting such "words"... If he's the creator of the wikia, I undertand somehow why he doesn't want it to die, but on the other side... Pikipedia is really much better at giving information, and it hasn't got the bad points of wikia (which is ads)
2016-06-09 16:50:05	Marty2000	understand*
2016-06-09 16:50:13	Marty2000	So he should move on and let Pikipedia be
2016-06-09 16:50:55	Marty2000	From what I see on Pikmin Wikia, most of their edits are either false information, or the same real world images we upload
2016-06-09 16:51:21	Marty2000	Again, Pikipedia is much better because everything is always proven, so...
2016-06-09 16:53:45	CreativeSushi	if the kids that edit the wikia came over here with their bad grammer and such came over here we would fix it
2016-06-09 16:53:50	CreativeSushi	they just let it be
2016-06-09 16:53:59	CreativeSushi	its just unmanaged 
2016-06-09 16:54:18	CreativeSushi	because there aren't enough people at a mature enough level to keep it going
2016-06-09 16:55:34	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-09 18:40:00	Yoshi2	Marty2000: that revert is so... random
2016-06-09 18:44:07	Yoshi2	but he reverted it back to your version again
2016-06-09 18:46:06	Marty2000	Yoshi2: yeah
2016-06-09 18:46:20	Marty2000	I don't know why he did that, but weel, he reverted, so that's fine
2016-06-09 18:46:24	Marty2000	well*

2016-06-09 19:03:00	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-09 19:04:22	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-06-09 19:04:22	Testyo	This Internet ain't big enough for the music
2016-06-09 19:05:44	@Espyo	hey
2016-06-09 19:06:10	@J	[20:51:50] @Espyo also it might be completely invisible to some colorblind people
2016-06-09 19:06:10	@J	[20:51:52] @Espyo (highlighting J)
2016-06-09 19:06:26	@J	my general tip for this type of thing is stick an outline on it
2016-06-09 19:06:34	@J	just a darker or lighter shade of the same colour
2016-06-09 19:06:39	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-09 19:06:42	@Espyo	good point
2016-06-09 19:06:44	@Espyo	CreativeSushi: hear that?
2016-06-09 19:06:44	@J	even 1 pixel works
2016-06-09 19:07:04	@J	this is what the current Pikipedia logo has
2016-06-09 19:07:15	@Espyo	that white glow
2016-06-09 19:07:31	@J	I meant the dark green on the outside of the flower
2016-06-09 19:07:40	@J	also the outline on the text helps it show up against the flower better
2016-06-09 19:08:30	@Espyo	uhm
2016-06-09 19:08:33	@Espyo	we don't have an outline :|
2016-06-09 19:08:44	@J	I see one
2016-06-09 19:08:54	@J	oh
2016-06-09 19:08:58	@J	I mean the logo, not the favicon
2016-06-09 19:09:07	@Espyo	yeah, I'm thinking the logo
2016-06-09 19:09:09	@Espyo	I see an outline on the text
2016-06-09 19:09:11	@Espyo	but not the flower
2016-06-09 19:09:32	@J	that one's quite subtle, not a good example anyway because it's not necessary for visibility
2016-06-09 19:09:45	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-09 19:09:48	@J	yeah, I guess in that case the white glow does act more as the outline against the busy background
2016-06-09 19:12:12	Yoshi2	the BW community I'm in now has 2 12 year olds and they both have some trouble (one moreso than the other, I think)
2016-06-09 19:12:34	Yoshi2	not sure what to do with them, but none of us wants to be a babysitter
2016-06-09 19:14:54	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-09 19:14:58	@Espyo	just ignore them, I guess
2016-06-09 19:15:32	@Espyo	speaking of troublesome people on a community's subreddit
2016-06-09 19:15:41	@Espyo	CreativeSushi linked to the script on reddit
2016-06-09 19:15:45	@Espyo	it was surprisingly well received
2016-06-09 19:15:58	@Espyo	except one douchebag started crying that hurr durr this is dumb, Pikipedia is dumb
2016-06-09 19:16:10	@Espyo	making threats about how he'll ban everybody as an admin
2016-06-09 19:16:17	@Espyo	curious, I checked out his reddit profile
2016-06-09 19:16:26	@Espyo	pretty filled with dumb opinions that get downvoted often
2016-06-09 19:16:31	@Espyo	but one of his posts
2016-06-09 19:16:36	@Espyo	was some years back
2016-06-09 19:16:45	@Espyo	it was him asking the Pikmin community which wiki they used (and getting no replies)
2016-06-09 19:16:49	@Espyo	and in it, he says he was...Dark Lord Revan
2016-06-09 19:16:54	@Espyo	the founder of the original wiki
2016-06-09 19:17:03	@Espyo	he's also on Pikipedia, where he edits like once in a full moon
2016-06-09 19:17:10	@Espyo	edited today, broke something and reverted it
2016-06-09 19:17:16	@Espyo	but he's always been kind of neutral to both wikis
2016-06-09 19:17:25	@Espyo	what rat crawled up his ass today to complain on reddit?
2016-06-09 19:17:28	Marty2000	(off-topic) Yoshi2, I could get a Winged Pikmin to chase after an enemy in the air with a running animation.
2016-06-09 19:17:31	@Espyo	weird stuff, and I'm not sure if we should do something about it
2016-06-09 19:18:31	@J	sounds fun
2016-06-09 19:18:50	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-09 19:18:57	@Espyo	one scary thing: he's still a bureaucrat on Pikipedia
2016-06-09 19:19:07	@Espyo	and for whatever reasons, bureaucrats can demote and ban other bureaucrats
2016-06-09 19:19:15	@Espyo	so if he decides to go nuts, we'll have to talk to Porple
2016-06-09 19:19:32	@J	I figure it's safer to leave it and do that if necessary
2016-06-09 19:19:54	@J	demoting him now could cause trouble that might never happen otherwise
2016-06-09 19:20:08	@Espyo	agreed
2016-06-09 19:20:11	@Espyo	I want to just ignore him
2016-06-09 19:20:12	@J	it's not like he can do anything irreversible
2016-06-09 19:20:17	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that too
2016-06-09 19:20:20	@Espyo	it's only a pain, that's all
2016-06-09 19:20:24	Yoshi2	I really wonder why he has to be so... unstable
2016-06-09 19:20:28	@Espyo	although, a scarier thing, is that he owns the Pikipedia facebook page
2016-06-09 19:20:36	@J	I like to avoid drama where possible
2016-06-09 19:20:38	@Espyo	and if he decides to seize it, I might not be able to get it back
2016-06-09 19:20:55	@Espyo	yeah, I'm not a fan of doing stuff with hostility around here
2016-06-09 19:21:01	@J	Yoshi2: my guess is he feels the wiki he created is running away from him by moving away from Wikia
2016-06-09 19:21:19	@Espyo	I'm more undecided between talking to him and trying to get him to understand what Pikipedia is all about, or just ignore him
2016-06-09 19:21:28	@J	you know how you feel about something you created and you're proud of
2016-06-09 19:21:32	@J	it's easy to get possessive
2016-06-09 19:21:49	@Espyo	definitely
2016-06-09 19:21:57	@Espyo	even if it makes no sense to do it, which is the case with him
2016-06-09 19:22:01	@Espyo	he sounds young
2016-06-09 19:22:02	@Espyo	or dumb
2016-06-09 19:22:03	@Espyo	...or both
2016-06-09 19:22:10	@Espyo	at least judging from his previous posts on reddit
2016-06-09 19:22:19	@Espyo	that's just intrusive as hell lol
2016-06-09 19:22:25	@Espyo	but I guess it's kinda necessary to know what we're dealing with
2016-06-09 19:22:28	@J	ONCE AGAIN
2016-06-09 19:22:36	@J	I have made a mixed sandwich
2016-06-09 19:22:46	@Espyo	not to say all young people are dumb
2016-06-09 19:22:53	@Espyo	PikFan has a good head on his shoulders and he's just a kid
2016-06-09 19:22:53	@J	a 3-tiered accidental masterpiece
2016-06-09 19:23:12	@Espyo	wait, I remember the last episode
2016-06-09 19:23:14	@Espyo	you did it AGAIN?
2016-06-09 19:23:18	@J	3 times now
2016-06-09 19:23:19	@Espyo	are you SURE it's accidental?
2016-06-09 19:23:24	@J	I am just bad at things
2016-06-09 19:23:37	@J	he can't be that young if he created the wiki
2016-06-09 19:23:38	Yoshi2	at around 16 I do expect a good head on their shoulders
2016-06-09 19:23:49	@J	that was 11 years ago
2016-06-09 19:24:07	@J	so he must be at least 20
2016-06-09 19:24:29	@Espyo	...yeah, that was a long time ago, wasn't it
2016-06-09 19:24:38	@Espyo	but hey, either way, it's not that hard to make a wiki on wikia
2016-06-09 19:26:18	Yoshi2	reddit has issues with the original creator of a subreddit being a bit... crazy
2016-06-09 19:26:52	@Espyo	yeah, sounds it
2016-06-09 19:40:18	@J	my brother is asking for recommendations for an open-world adventure game on PC, with a story, possibly with building, any ideas?
2016-06-09 19:40:39	@Espyo	uhmm... didn't the newest Mirror's Edge game come out on PC?
2016-06-09 19:40:53	@Espyo	it's open-world, it's got buildings, pretty sure it's got an interesting story
2016-06-09 19:40:56	@J	Mirror's Edge is open world?
2016-06-09 19:40:59	@Espyo	but it's a bit of its own genre
2016-06-09 19:41:03	@Espyo	I read that it was
2016-06-09 19:41:07	@Espyo	at least this one
2016-06-09 19:41:07	@J	building != buildings
2016-06-09 19:41:13	@Espyo	ooooohh
2016-06-09 19:41:13	@J	I meant construction
2016-06-09 19:41:19	@J	but that's an optional anyway
2016-06-09 19:41:21	@Espyo	I read an s
2016-06-09 19:41:28	@J	that is a weird request
2016-06-09 19:41:33	@Espyo	well, other than that, I don't really know of anything
2016-06-09 19:41:38	Yoshi2	I heard people critizise the new ME's open world
2016-06-09 19:41:53	@Espyo	I just heard that ME, both the original and the new one, are very niche
2016-06-09 19:42:01	@J	hah, apparently released today
2016-06-09 19:42:01	@Espyo	the people who like it really like it, the people who don't, don't
2016-06-09 19:42:07	@Espyo	ooooohhh
2016-06-09 19:42:13	@Espyo	that explains why I saw posts of it on reddit all of a sudden
2016-06-09 19:42:21	@Espyo	like, I figured it released soon
2016-06-09 19:42:22	@Espyo	but TODAY?
2016-06-09 19:42:37	@Espyo	wait, can "soon" even be used for the past?
2016-06-09 19:42:38	@J	today EU, was Tuesday NA
2016-06-09 19:42:46	@J	you want 'recently'
2016-06-09 19:42:46	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-09 19:42:51	@Espyo	yeah, I guess I do
2016-06-09 19:43:00	@Espyo	but my brain just said "soon fits here perfectly, trust me"
2016-06-09 19:44:23	Yoshi2	here I tried to modify terrain in BW: https://imgur.com/a/bhhep
2016-06-09 19:45:06	@Espyo	looks like you succeeded, mate
2016-06-09 19:45:11	@Espyo	not to what you WANTED to do, I think
2016-06-09 19:45:13	@Espyo	but you DID modify it
2016-06-09 19:45:24	Yoshi2	Indeed
2016-06-09 19:45:50	Yoshi2	the way terrain works in BW is that you are always teleported to the top of the solid terrain
2016-06-09 19:46:00	Yoshi2	so that disturbingly high terrain has fun side effects
2016-06-09 19:46:37	@Espyo	hehehe, neat
2016-06-09 19:46:42	@Espyo	that's really simple physics
2016-06-09 19:46:45	@Espyo	but it just works for what the game does
2016-06-09 19:48:55	Yoshi2	for the most part you don't notice the "teleport to top" thing because it normally only happens if you end up BELOW the terrain
2016-06-09 19:49:20	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-09 19:49:26	@Espyo	wouldn't you notice it on really steep terrain?
2016-06-09 19:49:31	@Espyo	unless I'm getting the wrong idea of how it works
2016-06-09 19:49:59	Yoshi2	the terrain normally isn't steep enough for it to cause any issues
2016-06-09 19:50:28	Yoshi2	I think the developers thought of smoothing the terrain enough that you won't run into a really steep wall that causes issues
2016-06-09 19:50:30	@Espyo	oh, yeah, but I mean steep terrain with mods
2016-06-09 19:50:35	@Espyo	'cause that tower you made looks really steep
2016-06-09 19:50:55	Yoshi2	yes, you would notice it on that tower
2016-06-09 19:51:04	Yoshi2	just need to jump into it with enough speed
2016-06-09 19:51:15	@J	are all the normal buildings just props, then?
2016-06-09 19:51:17	@J	not terrain?
2016-06-09 19:51:22	@Espyo	hehe
2016-06-09 19:51:41	Yoshi2	J: yes, all buildings, and terrain features like trees, grass and stones
2016-06-09 19:52:10	@J	sneaky
2016-06-09 19:52:13	Yoshi2	Espyo: nevermind, it actually isn't an issue

2016-06-09 19:52:55	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-09 19:53:06	Yoshi2	on the other side the tower is open though, so if you go behind it you technically end up below the terrain and will be teleported to the top
2016-06-09 19:53:26	@Espyo	right

2016-06-09 20:16:02	@Espyo	...yeah, it's just an iron ball
2016-06-09 20:16:05	@Espyo	wtf man
2016-06-09 20:16:25	Scruffy	Perhaps they didn't know there's an iron ball in one version of that area
2016-06-09 20:16:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-09 20:16:37	Marty2000	I remember having fun crushing the Pikmin of my enemy :D
2016-06-09 20:16:43	@Espyo	but if you look at it at least twice, you see that it is one
2016-06-09 20:16:46	@Espyo	well, I undid the edit
2016-06-09 20:17:02	@Espyo	I THINK I got that to happen when I went to Manchester and played with a friend
2016-06-09 20:17:37	Scruffy	There's one in the Corroded Maze as well, I think
2016-06-09 20:17:47	Scruffy	Or, it might be the other metal one
2016-06-09 20:17:49	Marty2000	Yes, Scruffy
2016-06-09 20:17:53	Marty2000	With two gates

2016-06-09 20:32:21	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fortress_of_Festivity#Objects There's an egg, in the level. It either drops nectar or ultra-spicy spray. But I don't know whether it was omitted from the article on purpose or not. If it was forgotten, then I'll add it, but I prefer asking first.
2016-06-09 20:33:09	Marty2000	Also, it seems that the egg in question only drops ultra-spicy nectar after retrieving at least one berry, but I'm not sure, I have to verify
2016-06-09 20:34:23	Marty2000	No, completely random
2016-06-09 20:34:33	@Espyo	hm, probably forgotten

2016-06-09 20:38:47	@PikFan	so, what are your guy's opinions about Pluto being a dwarf planet?
2016-06-09 20:38:52	Scruffy	Hi PikFan!
2016-06-09 20:38:58	@PikFan	that is, do you think it should still be a planet?
2016-06-09 20:39:04	Marty2000	Hmm... I don't really care a lot, honestly
2016-06-09 20:39:11	Marty2000	Hmm, I don't know
2016-06-09 20:39:59	Marty2000	When I meant I didn't care, I meant it's not problem whether it's a dwarf planet or a planet, sorry if it sounded impolite, heh

2016-06-09 20:40:46	@Espyo	PikFan: random much?
2016-06-09 20:40:52	@Espyo	but I guess you can't argue with the definition of a planet
2016-06-09 20:40:57	@Espyo	who are we to say what "sounds" right
2016-06-09 20:41:13	Scruffy	As long as Pluto is still called Pluto, it seems special to me
2016-06-09 20:41:19	Marty2000	Well, there are some others dwarf planets too, they are only called such because they lack some properties of other "planets"
2016-06-09 20:41:20	@PikFan	well, I just wanted to hear opinions
2016-06-09 20:41:27	Scruffy	So if it's a dwarf planet or a planet, there are still billions of others
2016-06-09 20:41:30	Scruffy	Without special names
2016-06-09 20:41:38	@PikFan	because some kids at school are adamant that Pluto be called a planet again
2016-06-09 20:41:50	Marty2000	Trivia: I named my cat "Charon"
2016-06-09 20:41:54	@PikFan	niiiice
2016-06-09 20:41:58	Marty2000	if you see what I mean ... :D
2016-06-09 20:42:07	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-06-09 20:42:22	Marty2000	When I was younger, I loved astronomy so much... I have a telescope, but I think it's broken now :/
2016-06-09 20:42:32	@PikFan	but yeah, they demand that Pluto be a planet again, completely disregarding the official definition of planet
2016-06-09 20:42:41	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-09 20:42:51	Scruffy	Oh, heh, I was about to ask if you were thinking of the moon or the myth when you named your cat

2016-06-09 20:44:03	Yoshi2	pluto
2016-06-09 20:44:07	Yoshi2	is a dog
2016-06-09 20:44:39	Scruffy	True
2016-06-09 20:45:03	Scruffy	I wonder if Mickey Mouse meant to name his dog after the god of the underworld
2016-06-09 20:45:04	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-09 20:45:18	@PikFan	I think it'd be cool if it was made into a planet again, but honestly, let'
2016-06-09 20:45:25	@PikFan	*let's leave Pluto as is
2016-06-09 20:45:44	@PikFan	and also, if you want Pluto to be a planet, what about Eris? Ceres? shouldn't they be planets, too?
2016-06-09 20:46:04	Marty2000	Yeah, you'd need to call them "planet t"oo
2016-06-09 20:46:07	Marty2000	"planet" too
2016-06-09 20:46:11	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-09 20:46:23	@PikFan	you can't advocate for one thing but leave out other things
2016-06-09 20:46:32	@PikFan	and this is why I hate hypocrites

2016-06-09 20:48:34	@PikFan	how'd it go?
2016-06-09 20:48:36	Scruffy	I realized that hidden subheadings are not good, they make the Table of Contents not work
2016-06-09 20:48:49	Scruffy	But we can keep subheadings visible and hide the content in them

2016-06-09 20:49:16	Scruffy	And it's cleaner than how it is currently
2016-06-09 20:49:33	Scruffy	We can use Pikmin Fanon's spoiler section template to hide things, actually
2016-06-09 20:49:39	Scruffy	Or just create a new template for it
2016-06-09 20:55:23	@PikFan	alright, gotta get going

2016-06-09 22:05:06	@Espyo	I figured
2016-06-09 22:05:10	@Espyo	otherwise choppers wouldn't make sense
2016-06-09 22:06:13	Yoshi2	I mean, if I mod a gap into the terrain due to a height difference, the vehicle acts differently when hitting this gap than infantry

2016-06-09 22:56:24	Marty2000	Oh, by the way, that's just a little thing (again, strange). You know, some time ago, I told you that title cases didn't exist in French, but they were used in Pikmin and Pikmin 2 (corrected for Pikmin 3). You also know that we have to put a space between a word and question/exclamation marks/colons in French. Again, they didn't respect that in te French

2016-06-09 23:02:06	Marty2000	Not to mention they forgot many accents on capital letters (but that's more common to forget them, heh). Everything was corrected for the American version, and Pikmin 3... I wonder if they also made mistakes in the treasure hoard or Piklopedia. That's something I'd like to see

2016-06-09 23:29:01	Marty2000	Well, they forgot to put accent for each capital letter... I checked for the American version, and they did add the accents for that version

2016-06-10 00:26:33	@PikFan	Espyo: why are you on Splatoon? I thought you only played on Sundays
2016-06-10 00:27:25	@Espyo	not ONLY
2016-06-10 00:27:31	@Espyo	it's just custom for me and my friends to play on Sunday
2016-06-10 00:27:34	@Espyo	trying out new weapons
2016-06-10 00:27:43	@Espyo	and complaining that lag favors the Japanese
2016-06-10 00:28:31	@PikFan	hahah, of course
2016-06-10 00:31:25	@PikFan	since they said they're doing updates till summer's end, I hope they make a new map
2016-06-10 00:31:52	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-06-10 00:31:53	@PikFan	I doubt it, but it'd still be nice
2016-06-10 00:32:44	@PikFan	however, I wonder if we'll get an update where it's got 3 new maps or something crazy like that
2016-06-10 00:32:59	@PikFan	since they've been releasing a lot of weapons at once in these updates

2016-06-10 16:34:22	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-10 16:34:43	@PikFan	alright, so
2016-06-10 16:35:22	@PikFan	you guys have been trying to convince me on the forums that I should keep writing
2016-06-10 16:35:29	@PikFan	of course you guys are right
2016-06-10 16:35:43	@PikFan	I was just feeling sorry for myself, but nobody likes that
2016-06-10 16:35:44	@Espyo	no need to be so black and white
2016-06-10 16:35:53	@Espyo	as I grow old, I realize that that's a REALLY strong rule in life
2016-06-10 16:35:59	@Espyo	"almost nothing is black and white"
2016-06-10 16:36:03	@Espyo	you weren't completely without reason too, you know
2016-06-10 16:36:13	@PikFan	funny you mention that
2016-06-10 16:36:49	@PikFan	because of my autism, I am a very black and white person, so it's still gonna take a while for me to learn that
2016-06-10 16:36:53	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-06-10 16:37:06	@PikFan	I bring this up, because yesterday I found an interesting piece of text
2016-06-10 16:37:23	@PikFan	it raises lots of good points
2016-06-10 16:38:09	@PikFan	worded kinda funny, but it gets the point across http://pastebin.com/UQEF8rdq
2016-06-10 16:39:04	@PikFan	"There is always someone better than you, and everyone has room for improvement. Do not think that you are perfect or a great writer, because that is not for you to decide."
2016-06-10 16:39:06	@PikFan	this
2016-06-10 16:39:23	@PikFan	this is pretty much the core of my struggle
2016-06-10 16:39:38	@Espyo	actually
2016-06-10 16:39:42	@Espyo	almost everybody thinks in a black and white way
2016-06-10 16:39:45	@Espyo	people just like resolve
2016-06-10 16:39:57	@Espyo	if they can get an easy answer for a tough question, one that doesn't involve many "ifs" or "buts"
2016-06-10 16:39:59	@Espyo	they'll take that
2016-06-10 16:40:17	@Espyo	hmm, I see
2016-06-10 16:40:26	@Espyo	the struggle that you want to be the best, or amongst the best
2016-06-10 16:40:29	@Espyo	otherwise what you do is pointless
2016-06-10 16:40:33	@Espyo	and you're just "another one", huh
2016-06-10 16:40:38	@Espyo	well
2016-06-10 16:40:39	@PikFan	I mean, my internal struggle
2016-06-10 16:40:54	@Espyo	right, which is about being great and perfectionist, right?
2016-06-10 16:41:03	@PikFan	well...yeah
2016-06-10 16:41:13	@Espyo	well, I'm not gonna say you're wrong to think that
2016-06-10 16:41:20	@Espyo	because that'd be a lie
2016-06-10 16:41:33	@Espyo	but it is true that it's a thought that's always with you till the day you die
2016-06-10 16:41:40	@Espyo	but you eventually learn to organize it better
2016-06-10 16:41:41	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-10 16:41:58	@Espyo	your life stops revolving around the fear of being good enough to be worth having your name in the list of people who DID something on this Earth
2016-06-10 16:42:09	@Espyo	you stop having to worry so much about letting yourself be meaningful
2016-06-10 16:42:19	@Espyo	and in turn, that just makes you want to live a good, chill life
2016-06-10 16:42:25	@Espyo	which could incidentally help raise you to the top
2016-06-10 16:42:48	@Espyo	I won't give you vague words of encouragement
2016-06-10 16:42:54	@Espyo	I'll give you real words, from my view of life
2016-06-10 16:43:06	@Espyo	I too want to be a recognized game developer
2016-06-10 16:43:08	@Espyo	or composer
2016-06-10 16:43:10	@Espyo	or anything
2016-06-10 16:43:25	@Espyo	I want something that's at least Mario-team-member level
2016-06-10 16:43:30	@Espyo	but I won't reach it
2016-06-10 16:43:33	@Espyo	and currently, I'm okay with this
2016-06-10 16:43:41	@Espyo	it's one goal, which will probably damn near kill me, and then what?
2016-06-10 16:43:48	@Espyo	people know me, and they can like me for what I do
2016-06-10 16:43:48	@Espyo	but
2016-06-10 16:43:52	@Espyo	I can make stuff that people like
2016-06-10 16:43:57	@Espyo	I can make people laugh, and tick their interest
2016-06-10 16:44:01	@Espyo	with just my own basic skills
2016-06-10 16:44:03	@Espyo	enter the engine
2016-06-10 16:44:09	@Espyo	I did it half because it was a fun little project for me
2016-06-10 16:44:13	@Espyo	half because I knew people would want it
2016-06-10 16:44:15	@Espyo	and look at it now
2016-06-10 16:44:23	@Espyo	it's...well, it's a pretty spiffy piece of software
2016-06-10 16:44:29	@Espyo	but it's so young, and so tacky, and so ill-known
2016-06-10 16:44:30	@Espyo	and yet
2016-06-10 16:44:34	@Espyo	I know some people have fun in it
2016-06-10 16:44:39	@Espyo	and most of all, perhaps
2016-06-10 16:44:43	@Espyo	I know *I* have fun with it
2016-06-10 16:44:48	@Espyo	every time I go to develop, I do it with a smile
2016-06-10 16:44:59	@Espyo	(except when C++ stops making sense and I'm stuck on a bug for an hour)
2016-06-10 16:45:11	@Espyo	I learn so much from it, I can create so many awesome features, and I'm doing something people enjoy
2016-06-10 16:45:15	@Espyo	this expands to other parts of my life too
2016-06-10 16:45:24	@Espyo	when I decide to play Splatoon on Sundays, and heck, even Smash on Saturdays
2016-06-10 16:45:29	@Espyo	I do it because it's a fun time with my friends
2016-06-10 16:45:37	@Espyo	I won't be a big Smash moment guy like Alpharad
2016-06-10 16:45:39	@Espyo	I know, I tried
2016-06-10 16:45:47	@Espyo	I have videos on youtube, they don't go over 1000 views
2016-06-10 16:45:49	@Espyo	but so what?
2016-06-10 16:45:52	@Espyo	I have fun with my friends
2016-06-10 16:46:09	@Espyo	I make them laugh with my stupid green shell throws that bounce off of a perfect shield and kill somebody across the map
2016-06-10 16:46:26	@Espyo	my job: being a developer that works on a bingo game engine
2016-06-10 16:46:33	@Espyo	it won't make me be worldwide acknowledge
2016-06-10 16:46:39	@Espyo	unless the company grows like mad in the span of a few years
2016-06-10 16:46:43	@Espyo	but I have fun working there
2016-06-10 16:46:52	@Espyo	I'm respected, I respect the others, and the environment is awesome
2016-06-10 16:46:55	@Espyo	and it brings food to the table
2016-06-10 16:46:58	@Espyo	and with all of this...
2016-06-10 16:46:59	@Espyo	I'm happy
2016-06-10 16:47:09	@Espyo	I don't WANT to be more "powerful"
2016-06-10 16:47:11	@Espyo	or recognized, or skilled
2016-06-10 16:47:22	@Espyo	I'm fine as is
2016-06-10 16:47:28	@Espyo	my life is great, and I improve the life quality of those around me
2016-06-10 16:47:34	@Espyo	even of some of those that aren't around me
2016-06-10 16:47:39	@Espyo	via videos or even wiki articles
2016-06-10 16:47:53	@Espyo	I do push forward to becoming better, because my brain drives me to it
2016-06-10 16:48:02	@Espyo	by being better, my life quality increases, and so does that of my loved ones
2016-06-10 16:48:06	@Espyo	and that's what I want
2016-06-10 16:48:10	@Espyo	that's what's good

2016-06-10 16:48:26	@Espyo	stuff will just be DIFFERENt
2016-06-10 16:48:28	@Espyo	not better
2016-06-10 16:48:37	@Espyo	they could be better, but they won't be better solely because I'm a big shot
2016-06-10 16:48:52	@Espyo	being respected amongst your piers is important
2016-06-10 16:48:56	@Espyo	but being the most respected one isn't
2016-06-10 16:49:21	@PikFan	so...you're telling me to value friendship?

2016-06-10 16:50:27	@Espyo	"making sure the comma is in the right place of that sentence" isn't a value
2016-06-10 16:50:36	@Espyo	it's not a skill, nor something that makes anything worthwhile
2016-06-10 16:50:41	@Espyo	"making a story that people enjoy" is
2016-06-10 16:50:48	@Espyo	that's the gist of it
2016-06-10 16:50:53	@Espyo	don't aim for perfection
2016-06-10 16:51:05	@Espyo	like I said on the thread, you won't reach it, and it's not a point that matters
2016-06-10 16:51:17	@Espyo	focus on what makes you have fun, what makes you grow as a person, and what interests other people
2016-06-10 16:51:21	@Espyo	that's how you win at life
2016-06-10 16:51:26	@Espyo	if the key to life is something else...
2016-06-10 16:51:30	@Espyo	well, heck, I don't want it
2016-06-10 16:51:35	@Espyo	if the secret to life is standing still forever
2016-06-10 16:51:38	@Espyo	then screw it, I'll go against that
2016-06-10 16:51:43	@Espyo	I WANT to have fun
2016-06-10 16:51:45	@Espyo	and have nice skills
2016-06-10 16:51:53	@Espyo	and play fetch with my dog
2016-06-10 16:51:58	@Espyo	focus on what YOU want
2016-06-10 16:52:00	@Espyo	and what YOU like
2016-06-10 16:52:11	@Espyo	and, well, try not to make it clash with what other people want
2016-06-10 16:52:15	@Espyo	otherwise nobody gets along
2016-06-10 16:52:22	@Espyo	do you REALLY want to create one piece that is 100% flawed?
2016-06-10 16:52:31	@Espyo	do you really want to be a world-renown writer?
2016-06-10 16:52:40	@Espyo	or do you just FEEL that that's how you should go about life?
2016-06-10 16:52:43	@Espyo	they're two different things
2016-06-10 16:52:49	@Espyo	and it's important for you to distinguish them
2016-06-10 16:54:09	@PikFan	mhm
2016-06-10 16:54:21	@PikFan	short responses; just trying to read it all
2016-06-10 16:54:27	@Espyo	of course
2016-06-10 16:54:42	UltraMario	2deep4me
2016-06-10 16:54:46	UltraMario	:p
2016-06-10 16:54:54	Scruffy	Well said Espyo
2016-06-10 16:55:00	UltraMario	^
2016-06-10 16:55:14	Scruffy	I feel the same way with using Blender
2016-06-10 16:55:22	Scruffy	like you do working on the engine
2016-06-10 16:55:34	Scruffy	The most important thing every time I open Blender is that I have fun using it
2016-06-10 16:55:37	@Espyo	thank you
2016-06-10 16:55:45	@Espyo	yeah, I don't doubt that it's the case with you, too
2016-06-10 16:55:54	@Espyo	and it shows
2016-06-10 16:55:58	@PikFan	I guess...
2016-06-10 16:56:19	@Espyo	you don't go through all the details on, for instance, the short movie you're making, solely because you want to be recognized as a future movie director
2016-06-10 16:56:21	@Espyo	that'd be cool, but
2016-06-10 16:56:27	@Espyo	you think it looks better with them
2016-06-10 16:56:31	@Espyo	and you have fun learning how to implement them
2016-06-10 16:56:32	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-10 16:56:35	@Espyo	and you know people will enjoy them
2016-06-10 16:56:45	Scruffy	I don't create it to be noticed
2016-06-10 16:56:52	Scruffy	I mean... I consider it
2016-06-10 16:56:57	@Espyo	of course
2016-06-10 16:56:59	Scruffy	But it's not my priority by any means
2016-06-10 16:57:15	@Espyo	think about it this way, PikFan
2016-06-10 16:57:22	@Espyo	if I aimed for the top, I'd cancel the engine now
2016-06-10 16:57:27	@Espyo	and work on something to give me money
2016-06-10 16:57:38	@Espyo	but in cancelling the engine, that'd make other people said
2016-06-10 16:57:45	@Espyo	I COULD do it, but I'd have to measure the consequences
2016-06-10 16:57:54	@Espyo	do I REALLY want to stop giving some people this dream?
2016-06-10 16:57:59	@Espyo	do I REALLY want to drop this fun project?
2016-06-10 16:58:01	@PikFan	np
2016-06-10 16:58:03	@PikFan	*no
2016-06-10 16:58:12	@Espyo	do I REALLY want to work on something of which I'm sure, for an arbitrary future?
2016-06-10 16:58:18	@Espyo	and the answer to those is a resounding no
2016-06-10 16:58:27	@Espyo	if I eventually get a chance to become a famous developer, I might take it
2016-06-10 16:58:31	@Espyo	again, if the consequences make it worth it
2016-06-10 16:58:42	@Espyo	if not, screw it, I died but not before releasing an awesome engine to the world
2016-06-10 16:58:49	@Espyo	AND, at the very least, its code is open
2016-06-10 16:58:55	@Espyo	so I trust it'll help others learn too
2016-06-10 16:59:26	@PikFan	I need to say something, though
2016-06-10 16:59:38	@PikFan	when I first started writing the story, I WAS having fun
2016-06-10 16:59:44	@PikFan	I didn't care what people though
2016-06-10 16:59:56	@PikFan	I had this idea, and I started writing it down
2016-06-10 17:00:01	@Espyo	there you go
2016-06-10 17:00:04	@Espyo	oh, also, here's another thought
2016-06-10 17:00:06	@PikFan	and it soon became the story
2016-06-10 17:00:08	@PikFan	wait, hold on
2016-06-10 17:00:09	@Espyo	you see Testyo? he's a fine tool for what he is
2016-06-10 17:00:09	Testyo	I wish sonic generatios had workshop compatability
2016-06-10 17:00:12	@Espyo	fun, useful
2016-06-10 17:00:17	@Espyo	his code, on the other hand?
2016-06-10 17:00:21	@Espyo	it'd make any grown developer vomit
2016-06-10 17:00:25	@Espyo	and yet, it works
2016-06-10 17:00:26	Testyo	Espyo is a flooder!
2016-06-10 17:00:26	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Green Pikmin by PikPikMaster100 (+180) http://www.pikminfanon.com/?curid=917&diff=53590
2016-06-10 17:00:39	@Espyo	so, that's one thing about creating content: the creation process doesn't have to be good to get a good end result
2016-06-10 17:00:57	@Espyo	(also, this is IRC, you can type your messages and I can type mine without us having to clash each other ;) )
2016-06-10 17:01:15	@PikFan	well, it feels like we're talking face to face right now
2016-06-10 17:01:17	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-10 17:01:46	@Espyo	we kinda are
2016-06-10 17:01:49	@Espyo	except through a different medium
2016-06-10 17:01:59	@PikFan	but yeah, I was having fun writing my story, silly as my ideas were
2016-06-10 17:02:15	@PikFan	did I get hung up on parts of it? of course
2016-06-10 17:02:28	@PikFan	but I still pulled through, because I wanted to see a result
2016-06-10 17:02:44	@PikFan	I wanted to feel pride knowing that I accomplished something
2016-06-10 17:02:49	@PikFan	in this case, writing each chapter
2016-06-10 17:02:57	@PikFan	I wanted to see where my story could go
2016-06-10 17:03:17	<--	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-06-10 17:03:22	@PikFan	and then...
2016-06-10 17:03:55	@PikFan	I don't know what happened, but then I started thinking all these crazy thoughts about people noticing me and such
2016-06-10 17:04:18	@PikFan	the focus shifted from writing my story to people noticing you
2016-06-10 17:04:21	@Espyo	sounds like a clash of interests
2016-06-10 17:04:24	@Espyo	you just shifted foc--
2016-06-10 17:04:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-10 17:04:35	@PikFan	I know there is nothing wrong with wanting people to notice me
2016-06-10 17:04:44	@PikFan	but if that's your sole focus
2016-06-10 17:04:49	@PikFan	it's not a very good one
2016-06-10 17:04:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-10 17:05:05	@Espyo	well, to me, in this case, it looks like your reward center is just all twisted about
2016-06-10 17:05:10	@Espyo	which I guess is normal for your age
2016-06-10 17:05:15	@Espyo	you can try to power it through and finish it
2016-06-10 17:05:22	@Espyo	and then your reward center will see the finish product
2016-06-10 17:05:37	@Espyo	and think "...huh, I guess I can feel accomplished with this project WITHOUT it being loved by many"
2016-06-10 17:05:49	@Espyo	it'll help you sort it out, and make it easier to understand your motivations for the future
2016-06-10 17:05:57	@Espyo	like I said, you eventually sort yourself out
2016-06-10 17:06:05	@Espyo	so the best course of action really is to just do whatever you think is right
2016-06-10 17:06:11	@Espyo	or whatever you feel best for you
2016-06-10 17:06:29	@PikFan	also, I should say
2016-06-10 17:06:40	@PikFan	I have a lot of inward anger
2016-06-10 17:07:10	@PikFan	I've had internalized anger for quite a while now
2016-06-10 17:07:29	@PikFan	I still have fun, yeah
2016-06-10 17:07:37	@Espyo	that's honestly pretty normal for your age, yeah
2016-06-10 17:07:49	@Espyo	I used to be a bit annoyed at everything when I was a teen too
2016-06-10 17:07:57	@Espyo	and unfairly got mad at my parent
2016-06-10 17:07:57	@Espyo	*s
2016-06-10 17:08:02	@Espyo	I can't think of having that happen nowadays
2016-06-10 17:08:04	@PikFan	but I believe that anger limits my ability to have fun
2016-06-10 17:08:06	@Espyo	well, unless they really do something dumb
2016-06-10 17:08:09	@Espyo	of course it does
2016-06-10 17:08:23	@Espyo	but you just have to do your best to understand it and control it
2016-06-10 17:08:28	@Espyo	more the former than the latter
2016-06-10 17:08:34	@Espyo	but either way, remember it'll get better with age
2016-06-10 17:08:53	@Espyo	that's a good thing about being a teen, is that nothing really makes sense and everything is wrong
2016-06-10 17:08:57	@PikFan	but you're not saying that I should just sit around and WAIT for me to get old, right?
2016-06-10 17:08:58	@Espyo	but it ALWAYS gets better as you get older
2016-06-10 17:09:03	@Espyo	nope
2016-06-10 17:09:07	@Espyo	I couldn't make you do that if I tried
2016-06-10 17:09:09	@PikFan	I should try to help myself get better?
2016-06-10 17:09:28	@Espyo	you should, although there's not much that you can do
2016-06-10 17:09:35	@Espyo	unless you have clinically described anger issues
2016-06-10 17:09:41	@Espyo	then you should use a psychologist or such
2016-06-10 17:09:45	@Espyo	other than that... it's just kinda normal
2016-06-10 17:09:47	@PikFan	no, I mean
2016-06-10 17:09:55	@Espyo	do your best to understand it, and it just comes natural
2016-06-10 17:10:10	@PikFan	comes naturally?
2016-06-10 17:10:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-10 17:10:24	@Espyo	understanding your feelings and all that
2016-06-10 17:10:26	@Espyo	and controlling them
2016-06-10 17:10:29	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Orange Pikmin by PikPikMaster100 (+128) http://www.pikminfanon.com/?curid=1351&diff=53591
2016-06-10 17:10:36	@Espyo	of course, to a certain degree
2016-06-10 17:10:36	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-10 17:10:41	@Espyo	nobody can really cry or become happy on a whim
2016-06-10 17:10:47	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-06-10 17:11:04	@Espyo	but controlling as in "there's a pebble in my shoe and I'm just screaming at people. this is actually stupid and I should stop, I'm not even THAT mad about it"
2016-06-10 17:12:08	@PikFan	I bet feeling sorry for one's self is also pretty common at my age
2016-06-10 17:12:11	@PikFan	because I do that
2016-06-10 17:12:13	@PikFan	A LOT
2016-06-10 17:12:45	@PikFan	in fact, I had to MAKE myself not feel sorry for myself when I was reading what you wrote
2016-06-10 17:13:43	@PikFan	what you wrote in the past half our, I mean
2016-06-10 17:13:47	@PikFan	*hour
2016-06-10 17:13:49	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-06-10 17:14:03	@PikFan	the smallest things can cause me to feel sorry for myself
2016-06-10 17:14:10	@Espyo	well, I guess it's kinda normal
2016-06-10 17:14:13	@Espyo	it ties in with the other stuff, too
2016-06-10 17:14:23	@PikFan	yup
2016-06-10 17:14:31	@PikFan	ties in with the attention-seeking
2016-06-10 17:14:32	Scruffy	I've been there
2016-06-10 17:14:39	@Espyo	it's a bit of a self-feeding cycle
2016-06-10 17:14:51	@PikFan	I think "a bit" is an understatement :P
2016-06-10 17:15:01	@Espyo	you feel sorry for yourself, which motivates you less to do stuff that makes you comfortable, which makes you feel sorry for yourself, which...
2016-06-10 17:15:08	@Espyo	the opposite is also true, though
2016-06-10 17:15:11	@PikFan	it's just a horrible mess
2016-06-10 17:15:28	@Espyo	you make cool stuff which makes you feel awesome, which makes you think you have an awesome life, which makes you push to be more awesome, which makes you feel more awesome, which...
2016-06-10 17:15:39	@Espyo	getting out of one and going to the other is tough
2016-06-10 17:15:42	@PikFan	and see, that's the thing
2016-06-10 17:15:51	@PikFan	I WANT to make awesome stuff
2016-06-10 17:15:55	@PikFan	but do I really?
2016-06-10 17:16:06	Scruffy	Yes
2016-06-10 17:16:14	@PikFan	if I really, truly wanted to make awesome things, I would put in more effort
2016-06-10 17:16:41	@Espyo	you know the answer to that
2016-06-10 17:16:47	@Espyo	you don't want to make awesome stuff because of making awesome stuff
2016-06-10 17:16:50	@Espyo	you want to do it because it's awesome
2016-06-10 17:16:56	@Espyo	and you know
2016-06-10 17:16:57	@Espyo	you ARE doing it
2016-06-10 17:17:00	@PikFan	I'm actually really spoiled, expecting things to just be handed to me
2016-06-10 17:17:06	@Espyo	look at the efforts you're going through to get a policy to clean up fanon
2016-06-10 17:17:08	@Espyo	why are you doing that?
2016-06-10 17:17:11	@Espyo	to prove your worth?
2016-06-10 17:17:16	@Espyo	no, you want to clean the wiki
2016-06-10 17:17:17	@PikFan	no
2016-06-10 17:17:20	@Espyo	you want to make it more awesome
2016-06-10 17:17:22	@Espyo	it's an awesome thing to do
2016-06-10 17:17:35	@Espyo	and you didn't find the motivation to do it just because it was a task on a checklist of things in life
2016-06-10 17:17:46	@Espyo	you can learn to not be spoiled, you know
2016-06-10 17:17:51	@Espyo	I know, because it happened to me
2016-06-10 17:17:59	@Espyo	throughout life... I've always had it good
2016-06-10 17:18:03	@Espyo	never had to work very hard for much
2016-06-10 17:18:12	@Espyo	my parents did try to make it so I wouldn't have EVERYTHING cut out for me
2016-06-10 17:18:12	@PikFan	and let's face it: when it's just one person wanting to clean up a whole wiki (especially a hormonal teen like me), it's pretty daunting
2016-06-10 17:18:16	@Espyo	but nothing out of the ordinary
2016-06-10 17:18:25	@Espyo	yet, throughout life, I just started learning that I could lose anything at any moment
2016-06-10 17:18:30	@Espyo	and that I can't rely on others always
2016-06-10 17:18:36	@Espyo	and most of all, I DON'T want to rely on others
2016-06-10 17:18:40	@Espyo	others deserve a break
2016-06-10 17:18:47	@Espyo	if I am to be of any worth, I have to pull my own weight
2016-06-10 17:18:51	@Espyo	which motivates me to do so
2016-06-10 17:18:56	@Espyo	which validates the fact
2016-06-10 17:19:05	@Espyo	now, I don't take anything for granted, and I can do stuff on my own
2016-06-10 17:19:15	@Espyo	simply because I understood how I felt and tried to take advantage of it
2016-06-10 17:19:23	@Espyo	yeah, of course it's daunting
2016-06-10 17:19:26	@Espyo	it's not really the simplest of tasks
2016-06-10 17:19:30	@Espyo	not many people just DO something like that
2016-06-10 17:19:40	@Espyo	heck, most that teens have to struggle with is their grades
2016-06-10 17:19:41	@Espyo	yawn
2016-06-10 17:19:51	@Espyo	so if you still manage to find the motivation to do THAT project
2016-06-10 17:19:58	@Espyo	and everybody around you barely finds the need to clean their room
2016-06-10 17:20:01	@Espyo	then you're doing SOMETHING right
2016-06-10 17:20:15	Scruffy	I'm really sorry, but I have to go for now
2016-06-10 17:20:22	@PikFan	bye Scruffy
2016-06-10 17:20:23	Scruffy	I ought to be back later

2016-06-10 17:20:53	@PikFan	actually, my room isn't clean either :P
2016-06-10 17:21:12	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-06-10 17:21:38	@PikFan	ANOTHER issue of mine (lots of issues, I know) is that I compare myself to other people
2016-06-10 17:21:50	@PikFan	and I compare myself in a negative way
2016-06-10 17:21:51	@Espyo	nobody's room is clean
2016-06-10 17:21:57	@Espyo	I just said that because mine was being a bit of a mess
2016-06-10 17:22:01	@Espyo	and I cleaned it up an hour ago
2016-06-10 17:22:04	@Espyo	so it's fresh in my mind :V
2016-06-10 17:22:10	@PikFan	"oh, I can't make cool things in Blender, so I'm not worthy"
2016-06-10 17:22:21	@PikFan	"oh, I can't program, so I'm not worthy"
2016-06-10 17:22:21	@Espyo	that's also normal
2016-06-10 17:22:29	@PikFan	"oh, I can't draw, ..."
2016-06-10 17:22:30	@PikFan	and so on
2016-06-10 17:22:33	@Espyo	but it ties in with what I said at the start
2016-06-10 17:22:39	@Espyo	so long as you're happy, and those around you are too
2016-06-10 17:22:48	@Espyo	do you REALLY care that you can't draw stuff on Blender?
2016-06-10 17:23:00	@Espyo	plus, it's not like you DON'T
2016-06-10 17:23:05	@Espyo	see, here comes the black-and-white thing again
2016-06-10 17:23:12	@Espyo	you have potential to do it
2016-06-10 17:23:13	@Espyo	anybody does
2016-06-10 17:23:18	@Espyo	it's not as much of a puzzle as programming is
2016-06-10 17:23:23	@Espyo	and even THAT is still doable
2016-06-10 17:23:34	@Espyo	some people are just born more inclined TOWARDS these tasks
2016-06-10 17:23:36	@Espyo	and less towards others
2016-06-10 17:23:39	@Espyo	others are jacks of all trades
2016-06-10 17:23:41	@Espyo	who cares
2016-06-10 17:23:56	@PikFan	and that ties back into the spoiled thing
2016-06-10 17:24:06	@Espyo	I'm not going to make the Street Fighter modding scene happy by being a guy who does science in Pikmin
2016-06-10 17:24:09	@PikFan	I just expect to be able to do something
2016-06-10 17:24:23	@PikFan	and when that doesn't happen, I just shut down
2016-06-10 17:24:28	@Espyo	well, I guess that, with time, you'll learn to realize that it's not quite like that
2016-06-10 17:24:32	@Espyo	that there's stuff you can and can't do
2016-06-10 17:24:37	@Espyo	and that that's truth for anybody in this world
2016-06-10 17:24:46	@Espyo	that'll help you feel not so much like a loser in comparison to all
2016-06-10 17:24:58	@PikFan	if I really did care, I would put in effort
2016-06-10 17:25:03	@Espyo	if you want to compare yourself to others, there's little more absolute than "we all have our strengths and weakenesses"
2016-06-10 17:25:09	@Espyo	if you're all weaknesses, then you suck
2016-06-10 17:25:11	@PikFan	well, MORE effort
2016-06-10 17:25:11	@Espyo	but you're not, so
2016-06-10 17:25:26	@Espyo	you do care, but you just don't pursue it that much
2016-06-10 17:25:34	@Espyo	the spoiled thing, and all
2016-06-10 17:25:36	@PikFan	I shouldn't even be comparing myself to others anyway
2016-06-10 17:25:41	@Espyo	plus, you don't currently understand the importance of it that much
2016-06-10 17:25:43	@Espyo	but you might in the future
2016-06-10 17:25:54	@Espyo	not that you shouldn't
2016-06-10 17:25:57	@Espyo	see, black and white again
2016-06-10 17:26:08	@Espyo	it's important for me to compare myself to my coworkers on my department
2016-06-10 17:26:15	@Espyo	to know what my strengths are and what my weaknesses are
2016-06-10 17:26:33	@Espyo	if I need to touch the cash system code... I kinda suck at it, even though I was initially raised in the company learning how that worked
2016-06-10 17:26:48	@Espyo	yet if I need to tamper with graphics, I'm on par with my boss, who is pretty much better than all of us
2016-06-10 17:27:09	@Espyo	this makes me know that my teammates are weak at handling graphics, and my knowledge is worth sharing when possible
2016-06-10 17:27:19	@Espyo	and that I should improve at understanding that weird cash system with questions
2016-06-10 17:27:23	@Espyo	if I just try to not compare myself to them
2016-06-10 17:27:29	@Espyo	I'll just know I know some stuff and not others
2016-06-10 17:27:36	@Espyo	but no idea on how to improve upon that
2016-06-10 17:28:07	@Espyo	and I've got no problem with being so bad at that one part
2016-06-10 17:28:08	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-06-10 17:28:17	@Espyo	others aren't, so if there are bugs related to it, they can still be fixed
2016-06-10 17:28:32	@Espyo	and I can STILL do something about it
2016-06-10 17:28:43	@Espyo	and in other parts, I can do better than others
2016-06-10 17:28:52	@Espyo	for the company and the department, it all works out anyway
2016-06-10 17:28:54	@Espyo	I pull my weight
2016-06-10 17:29:08	@Espyo	the others pull theirs
2016-06-10 17:29:09	@Espyo	all's good
2016-06-10 17:29:27	@PikFan	mhm
2016-06-10 17:29:52	@Espyo	but my shifting my opportunities and threats, I can make myself more useful to the team
2016-06-10 17:29:57	@Espyo	making the company more profitable
2016-06-10 17:30:02	@Espyo	more bugs get fixed with more people in less time
2016-06-10 17:30:10	@Espyo	so not only am I good as is, I'm getting better
2016-06-10 17:30:12	@Espyo	and others are too
2016-06-10 17:30:16	@Espyo	all this because of comparing each other
2016-06-10 17:30:28	@Espyo	of course, in this context, it's important to improve in a company because you can get fired
2016-06-10 17:30:38	@Espyo	whereas improving on the engine will only make it better, but not be life-threatening
2016-06-10 17:30:41	@Espyo	but it's not THAT big of a deal
2016-06-10 17:40:47	@PikFan	alright, 9:40
2016-06-10 17:40:52	@PikFan	gotta get to class
2016-06-10 17:41:04	@PikFan	I'm gonna be thinking about what you said
2016-06-10 17:41:08	@PikFan	it's a lot to chew on
2016-06-10 17:41:15	@PikFan	anyway, see ya

2016-06-10 18:34:35	@Espyo	sure thing
2016-06-10 18:34:35	@Espyo	hmm, might as well try Wii
2016-06-10 18:34:38	@Espyo	that way we'll know if it was fixed right away
2016-06-10 18:35:17	Marty2000	Ok, I'll try both.
2016-06-10 18:42:08	@Espyo	oh, we know it works on the GameCube
2016-06-10 18:42:11	@Espyo	HSS recorded it there
2016-06-10 18:42:11	@Espyo	so
2016-06-10 18:42:15	Marty2000	I have to start a new save in the Gamecube version, though
2016-06-10 18:42:15	@Espyo	do it on the Wii
2016-06-10 18:42:18	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-10 18:42:21	@Espyo	if it works, we'll know it works everywhere
2016-06-10 18:42:27	@Espyo	if not, we'll need to find exactly where it got fixed

2016-06-10 18:53:41	@Espyo	right
2016-06-10 18:56:06	Marty2000	Seems you cannot, because it's impossible to press A in front of the cave until the cutscene for discovering it begins
2016-06-10 18:56:11	Marty2000	I'll retry...

2016-06-10 19:02:04	Marty2000	The cutscene didn't start

2016-06-10 19:10:02	Marty2000	Espyo: it works

2016-06-10 19:10:43	@Espyo	oh?
2016-06-10 19:11:38	Marty2000	There's a custcene that plays when you approach a cave
2016-06-10 19:11:46	Marty2000	(Ship's dialogs)
2016-06-10 19:12:22	Marty2000	But if a leader dies, these cutscenes cannot play for a few seconds
2016-06-10 19:13:36	Marty2000	It's like the non-Blue being able to carry treasures on water in P2

2016-06-10 19:14:24	@Espyo	right
2016-06-10 19:14:43	Marty2000	If you see HSS's video, the Pikmin can carry treasures in water during cutscenes, and for a few seconds after the cutscene had ended
2016-06-10 19:15:02	@Espyo	I didn't notice it also worked a few seconds AFTER
2016-06-10 19:15:10	@Espyo	I had the idea the effects stopped the second the cutscene did
2016-06-10 19:16:15	Marty2000	Similarly, after a cutscene, you cannot pause the game for a few seconds
2016-06-10 19:16:25	Marty2000	(and you cannot move the cursor in the WIi version, heh)
2016-06-10 19:16:32	@Espyo	hmm

2016-06-10 19:18:09	Marty2000	But I was wondering if we added it somewhere that certain things couldn't happen right after cutscenes would end

2016-06-10 19:24:05	Marty2000	I mean, it's really more popular in Japan

2016-06-10 19:26:50	Scruffy	Hello everybody!
2016-06-10 19:26:52	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy
2016-06-10 19:27:07	Scruffy	Espyo, how did things go with PikFan
2016-06-10 19:27:09	Scruffy	?
2016-06-10 19:27:17	@Espyo	he never said much
2016-06-10 19:27:33	@Espyo	he'll think about it as he goes to class
2016-06-10 19:27:41	@Espyo	wait, I worded that so stupidly
2016-06-10 19:27:44	@Espyo	let me try again from the top
2016-06-10 19:27:48	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-10 19:27:54	@Espyo	he said it was a lot to chew, so he'd think about it while in class
2016-06-10 19:28:06	Neocraftz1553	om nom nom
2016-06-10 19:28:19	Scruffy	Okay
2016-06-10 19:28:57	Scruffy	Personally I think the idea of a grading system in school is a big contributor to that kind of mindset
2016-06-10 19:29:05	@Espyo	hmm, yeah...
2016-06-10 19:29:07	@Espyo	at least in America
2016-06-10 19:29:14	Scruffy	Yep
2016-06-10 19:29:21	@Espyo	over here, you get graded from 0 to 20, and a 10 is good enough for you to pass on
2016-06-10 19:29:25	@Espyo	heck, a 9.5 rounds to 10
2016-06-10 19:29:29	@Espyo	so here, you just need to know this
2016-06-10 19:29:31	@Espyo	not be GOOD at it
2016-06-10 19:29:36	Scruffy	YEah
2016-06-10 19:29:50	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: as always, I'm keeping your channel warm
2016-06-10 19:29:53	Scruffy	But I mean, I don't even see a need to standardize your knowledge to a number
2016-06-10 19:30:27	@Espyo	yeah, as a whole, the educational system is pretty wrong
2016-06-10 19:30:32	@Espyo	but I guess there's no other easy way to do it
2016-06-10 19:30:36	@Espyo	or at least nobody thought of it
2016-06-10 19:30:40	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-10 19:30:50	@Espyo	there's a LOT of kids out there, there has to be an efficient way to get a general idea of how good they are at something
2016-06-10 19:30:52	@Espyo	and those numbers just owrk
2016-06-10 19:30:54	@Espyo	*work
2016-06-10 19:31:24	Scruffy	Once I had an idea that all universities became one big super-university, that contributed to Wikipedia and made it the most reliable source of knowledge the human species has

2016-06-10 19:31:50	@Espyo	yeah, but I guess universities aren't really trying to get knowledge out there as much as they're trying to teach people
2016-06-10 19:31:55	Neo	As always, my keyboard messes up STRICTLY during chat
2016-06-10 19:32:09	Neo	heh

2016-06-10 19:32:30	Neo	my teacher would never approve
2016-06-10 19:34:43	Marty2000	Yeah, teachers also tell students to never go on Wikipedia because everybody can modify and add wrong info, blah blah blah

2016-06-10 19:35:13	Marty2000	Sorry for sounding impolite, but that's my opinion, and honestly, everybody goes on Wikipedia, it's a good site
2016-06-10 19:35:23	@Espyo	yeah, that's true
2016-06-10 19:35:33	Neo	it is
2016-06-10 19:35:42	@Espyo	it's probably a lot of factors, though
2016-06-10 19:35:53	@Espyo	Wikipedia tends to be more about having info about a subject, not so much to TEACH it
2016-06-10 19:35:57	Neo	when ever wrong info is added, they try their best to fix it
2016-06-10 19:35:58	@Espyo	and there IS always that risk of it being wrong
2016-06-10 19:36:05	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-10 19:36:09	@Espyo	plus, schools normally have partnerships with book publishers
2016-06-10 19:36:15	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-10 19:36:25	Neo	always the books
2016-06-10 19:36:51	Neo	this year we had some books they forgot to replace years ago
2016-06-10 19:37:01	Neo	one was from 3 years back
2016-06-10 19:37:37	Neo	So it was all written in
2016-06-10 19:38:19	Yoshi2	wikipedia is pretty terrible at info about maths stuff
2016-06-10 19:38:25	Scruffy	True
2016-06-10 19:38:41	Neo	hey Scruffy
2016-06-10 19:38:41	@Espyo	sometimes programming
2016-06-10 19:39:01	Yoshi2	either too complicated, or too weird notation
2016-06-10 19:39:18	Yoshi2	so you want to check other places for that info
2016-06-10 19:39:27	Neo	have you ever used CrazyBump?
2016-06-10 19:39:32	Neo	You should use it
2016-06-10 19:39:35	Scruffy	Use it quite a bit
2016-06-10 19:39:38	Scruffy	It's great
2016-06-10 19:39:39	Neo	yeah
2016-06-10 19:39:44	Neo	I have the trail

2016-06-10 19:39:59	Neo	err...
2016-06-10 19:40:00	Scruffy	I used it when I made HD Olimar and Louie for the Pik-Min poster
2016-06-10 19:40:13	Neo	yeah
2016-06-10 19:40:18	Scruffy	Since then I've been using it all over
2016-06-10 19:40:44	Neo	I use it for a few models from past Nintendo games, as well as other textures
2016-06-10 19:40:49	Neo	such as Molgera
2016-06-10 19:41:00	Neo	favorite boss
2016-06-10 19:41:04	@Espyo	ooh, neat
2016-06-10 19:41:51	Neo	its useful

2016-06-10 19:46:29	Neocraftz1553	ahhh, ok
2016-06-10 19:46:30	Yoshi2	e.g. the topic of a IRC channel
2016-06-10 19:46:59	Neocraftz1553	Molgera: It splits its head

2016-06-10 19:52:10	Scruffy	but that's not even the hard part: the hard part is the next step, weight painting
2016-06-10 19:52:25	@Espyo	hmm? never heard of that
2016-06-10 19:52:36	Scruffy	Because you can tell a model to behave according to a skeleton, but then you have to say how much each bone effects each area
2016-06-10 19:53:09	@Espyo	oh...
2016-06-10 19:53:10	Scruffy	By painting the surface from blue to red, red being most effected, you are painting the "weight" of each bone
2016-06-10 19:53:12	@Espyo	never really thought about that
2016-06-10 19:53:13	Neocraftz1553	weight painting is cool, but... its painfully hard to do sometimes
2016-06-10 19:53:25	Neocraftz1553	mosttimes
2016-06-10 19:53:46	Scruffy	Because some vertices aren't 100% attached to the bone
2016-06-10 19:54:04	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-06-10 19:54:21	Neocraftz1553	mostly cause I don't get it yet :|
2016-06-10 19:54:22	@Espyo	right, it makes sense, now that I think about it
2016-06-10 19:54:45	Neocraftz1553	I don't get Vertex painting either
2016-06-10 19:55:04	Neocraftz1553	I have sculpting  somewhat down though
2016-06-10 19:55:04	Scruffy	Oh Neo, vertex painting is awesome
2016-06-10 19:55:22	Neocraftz1553	How so?
2016-06-10 19:55:26	Scruffy	you select a color from the tools menu, then paint them on individual vertices
2016-06-10 19:55:47	Neocraftz1553	thats it?
2016-06-10 19:55:54	Scruffy	then in node editor, you look for the input node called "Vertex Colors"
2016-06-10 19:56:04	Neocraftz1553	mhmm
2016-06-10 19:56:19	Scruffy	If you apply it to the color of a shader, then the shader will be those colors
2016-06-10 19:56:31	Scruffy	Essentially color without a texture
2016-06-10 19:56:36	Scruffy	That you control
2016-06-10 19:56:37	Neocraftz1553	I see... oh
2016-06-10 19:56:58	Neocraftz1553	so you can use it as a factor, too
2016-06-10 19:57:08	Scruffy	But I normally either mix it with other colors, or I use it to control something else, like the mix fac– exactly
2016-06-10 19:57:22	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see now
2016-06-10 19:57:28	Neocraftz1553	ok, I'll try it
2016-06-10 19:57:58	Neocraftz1553	actually, I see how you can easily add grunge, dirt, and rust to a model like that
2016-06-10 19:58:10	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-10 19:58:41	Scruffy	Have any of you heard of Media Molecule's latest project for the PS4, Dreams?
2016-06-10 19:59:01	Neocraftz1553	no, but I had one last night
2016-06-10 19:59:18	Scruffy	Media Molecule created Little Big Planet with the intention of giving everyone the ability to intuitively create game levels
2016-06-10 19:59:44	Scruffy	They had to hand off the rights, but now they're back in business after like 4 years or so of work
2016-06-10 20:00:02	Scruffy	And they have a new game, really more of a tool for the PS4
2016-06-10 20:00:50	Scruffy	That's a fully 3D modelling, painting, texturing, rigging, compiling, composing, and game sharing software
2016-06-10 20:00:58	Neocraftz1553	Wow
2016-06-10 20:01:00	Scruffy	Not to mention, it's voxel-based!!!
2016-06-10 20:01:07	Neocraftz1553	coool
2016-06-10 20:01:10	Scruffy	Which means everything is made out of atoms
2016-06-10 20:01:19	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-06-10 20:01:46	Scruffy	And you can create your own textures to things just by sculpting it, without worrying about vertices or hollow meshes or things like that
2016-06-10 20:02:21	Scruffy	I'm just worried that the PS4 can't handle it
2016-06-10 20:03:31	Scruffy	But progress on it seems to be going swimmingly so far
2016-06-10 20:03:31	Scruffy	Crap
2016-06-10 20:03:31	Scruffy	Olimar just has the /tiniest/ gap between his spacesuit and the metal rim on his helmet
2016-06-10 20:03:57	Scruffy	I thought they were connected, but they aren't even double-vertices
2016-06-10 20:04:05	Scruffy	They're separated
2016-06-10 20:04:19	Scruffy	Olimar is subject to the oxygen in the environment
2016-06-10 20:05:05	@Espyo	so... Olimar is canonically death
2016-06-10 20:05:12	@Espyo	this is a dream he has on the last seconds of his life
2016-06-10 20:06:13	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-10 20:06:31	Scruffy	I'm actually making a video about the symbolic significance of the Plasm Wraith
2016-06-10 20:06:37	Scruffy	The script is nearly complete
2016-06-10 20:06:44	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2016-06-10 20:06:46	@Espyo	interesting
2016-06-10 20:07:25	@Espyo	animation -> hitbox -> hazard -> status effect -> animation
2016-06-10 20:07:30	@Espyo	I hate cyclical dependencies...
2016-06-10 20:09:22	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-06-10 20:09:34	Neocraftz1553	the cycle of hazards
2016-06-10 20:09:58	@Espyo	ok, I just told C++ that, for hitboxes, hazards aren't a thing, but they're meant to
2016-06-10 20:10:01	@Espyo	it makes sense in the language
2016-06-10 20:10:04	@Espyo	doesn't make sense anywhere else
2016-06-10 20:10:05	@Espyo	but it works

2016-06-10 20:23:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it has happened to every blender artist at least once
2016-06-10 20:23:23	Neocraftz1553	yeah, at least once
2016-06-10 20:25:40	Neocraftz1553	have any of you heard of Zombie Chickens recently?
2016-06-10 20:25:52	Neocraftz1553	apperently, they are real
2016-06-10 20:27:17	Neocraftz1553	They claw their way out from wherever they where buried under...

2016-06-10 20:50:34	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Easter_egg#Singing I feel like there's more to add/there's wron information. I think that if you have 50 of a type out, they still sing. I don't remember needing 100 Pikmin, but I have to verify
2016-06-10 20:55:17	Marty2000	"If 20 idle Pikmin of one type are left alone for long enough, they will sing along with the area music." Seems it's not the case for the music that plays in the morning on the Garden of Hope
2016-06-10 20:55:30	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-06-10 20:55:32	Scruffy	Interesting
2016-06-10 20:55:42	Scruffy	Perhaps it's more than 20?
2016-06-10 20:56:12	Marty2000	Well, I do know they can sing along with the area music (Garden of Hope - Music for the afternoon, for example)
2016-06-10 20:56:29	Marty2000	But I don't know if it happens in each area
2016-06-10 20:57:33	Marty2000	It's going to be afternoon in the Garden of Hope, we'll see
2016-06-10 20:58:56	Marty2000	Ok, they sing along with the area music during certain parts of the music
2016-06-10 20:59:15	Marty2000	Let's see with a single Pikmin type
2016-06-10 20:59:22	Marty2000	(how many Pikmin are needed)
2016-06-10 21:04:24	Marty2000	Seems they do not sing along with the area music at night too
2016-06-10 21:04:37	Marty2000	Well, during the sunset variation of the music
2016-06-10 21:05:35	Marty2000	Oh, I misread
2016-06-10 21:05:44	Marty2000	"If 20 idle Pikmin of one type are left alone for long enough, they will sing along with the area music."
2016-06-10 21:05:51	Marty2000	I read "of each type"
2016-06-10 21:05:56	Marty2000	Well, it still works anyway :p
2016-06-10 21:06:30	@Espyo	yeah, that section needs a major rewrite
2016-06-10 21:06:42	@Espyo	didn't another user add something about singing recently?
2016-06-10 21:06:49	@Espyo	oh, it was you :|
2016-06-10 21:07:30	Marty2000	What did I add?
2016-06-10 21:07:48	@Espyo	they'll sing X song if there are still treasures, Y if not
2016-06-10 21:08:15	Marty2000	Yeah, I've never added it :/ I should, but it's quite hard to explain those "songs"
2016-06-10 21:08:22	Marty2000	It's not hard to explain when they play
2016-06-10 21:08:28	Marty2000	JUst the song itself :p
2016-06-10 21:08:31	Marty2000	just*
2016-06-10 21:09:08	Marty2000	I meant, the songs themselves
2016-06-10 21:09:13	@Espyo	you can just say that they sing one thing when there are still treasures, and another when there are not
2016-06-10 21:09:22	@Espyo	or "a six-note song" and "three-note song"
2016-06-10 21:09:39	Marty2000	Well, okay, thanks. That will be easier
2016-06-10 21:10:01	@Espyo	it should be enough, too
2016-06-10 21:10:08	@Espyo	oh, does this happen on Challenge Mode too?
2016-06-10 21:10:16	@Espyo	might be interesting to check 2PB too
2016-06-10 21:10:38	Marty2000	Heh, I don't remember... I do think it's the same for Challenge Mode... I should check on DOlphin
2016-06-10 21:10:40	Marty2000	Dolphin
2016-06-10 21:13:58	Marty2000	Same in Challenge Mode

2016-06-10 21:16:58	@Espyo	nice
2016-06-10 21:21:56	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin_Nintendo_logo_Japanese_voice.ogg I always wondered what that voice was saying
2016-06-10 21:22:23	Marty2000	That sounds weird for us, heh
2016-06-10 21:22:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-10 21:22:37	@Espyo	but it's so compressed, that it might even be weird for a native Japanese speaker
2016-06-10 21:22:53	Marty2000	When my friend is available, I'll ask her if she can tell me if that voice means something
2016-06-10 21:23:09	@Espyo	might be impossible... but I hope it's not!
2016-06-10 21:23:09	Marty2000	We'll have to wait for a few weeks, but wwell
2016-06-10 21:23:17	Marty2000	Yeah, that sounds really weird
2016-06-10 21:23:30	Marty2000	Japanese doesn't really sound like that (at least from what I know)
2016-06-10 21:23:38	@Espyo	same, honestly
2016-06-10 21:24:24	Marty2000	Maybe it's a guy that wants to say "Booyah" (no, I'm joking). I also know it happens very rarely (at least in the NPC! release). I got it only twice or thrice
2016-06-10 21:24:30	Marty2000	three times*
2016-06-10 21:25:13	Marty2000	I don't think there's any difference between the Wii and Gamecube version
2016-06-10 21:25:31	Marty2000	Does it happen quite "often" to you?

2016-06-10 21:26:18	@Espyo	never got it to happen to me
2016-06-10 21:26:24	@Espyo	and I tried booting the game some 200 times on Dolphin
2016-06-10 21:26:25	@Espyo	to measure stats
2016-06-10 21:26:29	@Espyo	gave up because I couldn't get it
2016-06-10 21:27:15	Marty2000	Well, I understand you, it's so rare... got it only twice in seven years, as I said
2016-06-10 21:27:29	Marty2000	So you can spend your time trying, but you will need luck :p

2016-06-10 21:41:19	Marty2000	True... for enemies and Pellet Posies, at least

2016-06-10 21:41:34	Marty2000	It's not really the same for crystal gates
2016-06-10 21:41:54	Marty2000	Let's take, for instance, the one in the Tropical Forest (Mission Mode)
2016-06-10 21:42:22	Marty2000	If you leave the Rock Pikmin destroy it alone, it should deal 20 points of damages every time it hits the gate
2016-06-10 21:42:32	Marty2000	It destroys the gate after 93 hits
2016-06-10 21:42:46	Marty2000	However, using the charge move, it should only deal 10 points of damages...
2016-06-10 21:42:55	Marty2000	But it only destroys the gate in 9 charges :p
2016-06-10 21:43:05	Marty2000	And I use the same part of the gate for each experiment
2016-06-10 21:44:12	Marty2000	Same when it is thrown
2016-06-10 21:44:58	Marty2000	So when charging, Rock Pikmin deal the same number of damages as when they are thrown (only for gates)

2016-06-11 00:21:45	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-11 00:22:53	@PikFan	so, reading some news articles
2016-06-11 00:23:34	@PikFan	apparently there's a big firestorm going on on Twitter between Trump, Clintion, Elizabeth Warren, and Reince Priebus
2016-06-11 00:23:41	@PikFan	it's...quite interesting
2016-06-11 00:23:48	Scruffy	Please
2016-06-11 00:24:01	@PikFan	what I want to know is, why are they all squabbling when they should be focused on the election?
2016-06-11 00:24:21	Scruffy	Because this election is a farce
2016-06-11 00:24:34	@PikFan	farce for who?
2016-06-11 00:25:00	Scruffy	Firstly the idea that Trump could get this far is pretty farcical
2016-06-11 00:25:45	Scruffy	And secondly the negativity that has plagued the major candidates' campaigns just makes you feel bad
2016-06-11 00:26:18	@PikFan	there's just so much vitriol...
2016-06-11 00:26:36	@PikFan	there's always vitriol associated with politics, but I've never seen THIS much
2016-06-11 00:26:47	Scruffy	About things not even related to the presidency
2016-06-11 00:27:02	@PikFan	...then again, it's really the ONLY election I clearly remember
2016-06-11 00:27:14	@PikFan	the last one happened when I was 12, and I didn't care back then
2016-06-11 00:27:17	Scruffy	Not a good year to be your first year voting though
2016-06-11 00:27:26	@PikFan	oh, I'm 16
2016-06-11 00:27:35	@PikFan	so I can vote ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-06-11 00:27:38	@PikFan	*can't
2016-06-11 00:27:42	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-11 00:27:47	Scruffy	This'll be my first year
2016-06-11 00:28:05	@PikFan	who will you be voting for?
2016-06-11 00:28:36	Scruffy	I wanted to support Bernie Sanders, as although I thought his ideas were ambitious, he at least had studies and sensible reasoning to back up what he said
2016-06-11 00:28:51	@PikFan	mhm
2016-06-11 00:28:53	Scruffy	But now, I feel like I have to defend the presidency from Donald Trump
2016-06-11 00:28:57	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-11 00:29:30	@PikFan	a lot of people agree with you
2016-06-11 00:30:01	Scruffy	I'm amazed how many people like him though
2016-06-11 00:30:48	@PikFan	well, there's a lot of issues going on in this country, and Trump has brought some of those issues to light
2016-06-11 00:30:56	@PikFan	that doesn't excuse his rhetoric though
2016-06-11 00:31:59	Scruffy	Nor his idea that a wall between the United States and Mexico should or will solve anything
2016-06-11 00:32:13	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2016-06-11 00:32:51	@PikFan	though, I have to say
2016-06-11 00:33:06	@PikFan	I wonder how many laws will be broken in this election
2016-06-11 00:33:17	@PikFan	from both sides, really
2016-06-11 00:33:29	@PikFan	both parties are just so corrupt
2016-06-11 00:33:46	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-11 00:34:06	@PikFan	to be honest, I'm a Republican (I would be anyway)
2016-06-11 00:34:19	@PikFan	but there's just so much thievery and dishonesty
2016-06-11 00:34:36	Scruffy	and I find it kind of petulant to use Twitter to jab at opponents
2016-06-11 00:34:43	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-06-11 00:34:47	@PikFan	it's just obnoxious
2016-06-11 00:34:54	Scruffy	I don't want that kind of immaturity running the country

2016-06-11 00:41:14	Scruffy	Oh, sorry, yes
2016-06-11 00:41:26	@PikFan	in which case, of course

2016-06-11 01:25:03	Scruffy	The only thing that would be different is the infobox in Pikmin:Wrath of Mr. B would turn into a hideable stats template

2016-06-11 01:25:20	Scruffy	And let me know what you think
2016-06-11 01:27:16	@PikFan	right
2016-06-11 01:27:17	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-11 01:27:29	@PikFan	ehhh, the collapsible sections could be better
2016-06-11 01:27:35	@PikFan	we need to find a better way
2016-06-11 01:28:23	Scruffy	I found <dl> to be useful
2016-06-11 01:28:37	Scruffy	And it's hideable

2016-06-11 01:30:25	Scruffy	But the game header templates do not like being hidden

2016-06-11 01:32:03	Scruffy	I'll have to ask Espyo, I'm no good at designing template
2016-06-11 01:32:05	Scruffy	s
2016-06-11 01:32:49	Scruffy	Unless you have an idea?
2016-06-11 01:33:02	@PikFan	nope, sorry
2016-06-11 01:33:27	Scruffy	that's okay, we can deal with that tomorrow
2016-06-11 01:33:46	Scruffy	But do you think that's at least an improvement? Or would you rather it all be visible to you?
2016-06-11 01:34:09	Scruffy	I'm fine either way, I'm just trying to get to what's most convenient and clean
2016-06-11 01:35:09	@PikFan	I'd prefer if they looked bigger like actual sections
2016-06-11 01:35:19	@PikFan	*section headers
2016-06-11 01:36:17	Scruffy	How do you mean?
2016-06-11 01:39:40	@PikFan	well, like the size of header 3
2016-06-11 01:39:46	@PikFan	subsection headers, I mean
2016-06-11 01:39:56	@PikFan	took me a moment to realize that they were there
2016-06-11 01:40:12	@PikFan	I think it's also because they were centered, so that threw me off
2016-06-11 01:41:58	Scruffy	Yeah, that's because of the spoiler template
2016-06-11 01:42:45	Scruffy	I wish they could be section headers, and you just click on the game title to open the whole section
2016-06-11 01:42:50	Scruffy	Like on mobile
2016-06-11 01:43:13	Scruffy	But Espyo told me if that sort of thing were implemented on desktop, it wouldn't work on movile
2016-06-11 01:43:42	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2016-06-11 01:44:01	@PikFan	that's because Fanon doesn't even have a mobile version
2016-06-11 01:44:54	@PikFan	but yeah, let's not worry about it for the time being
2016-06-11 01:44:58	@PikFan	we'll work it out
2016-06-11 01:45:12	Scruffy	No problem
2016-06-11 01:45:18	Scruffy	Thank you for your input!

2016-06-11 13:38:28	@Espyo	Earth is cool and all, but travelling space is a once-in-a-lifetime thing

2016-06-11 13:42:44	Marty2000	Splatfest*
2016-06-11 13:43:15	Marty2000	Hmm... in Pikmin 3, when Pikmin are thrown into Candypop Buds, they disappear from the "field" counter until the Candypop Bud spit them out
2016-06-11 13:43:35	UltraMario	rip my question :p
2016-06-11 13:43:45	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-11 13:43:47	UltraMario	oh wait
2016-06-11 13:43:49	Marty2000	Hmm... I don't know

2016-06-11 13:44:38	Marty2000	Sure
2016-06-11 13:46:39	Marty2000	So, what would happen if I brought a pellet to an Onion while the Pikmin are stocked in the Candypop Bud? (they will be spat out a few seconds afterwards)
2016-06-11 13:46:54	Marty2000	I'm going to try
2016-06-11 13:46:58	@Espyo	haha, good question
2016-06-11 13:47:08	@Espyo	also, try ending the day during this
2016-06-11 13:47:11	@Espyo	will the deaths count?
2016-06-11 13:47:19	Marty2000	Oh, yeah
2016-06-11 13:48:03	--	AFKazooie is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-06-11 13:48:10	Marty2000	The Onion will not spit out any seed
2016-06-11 13:49:38	Marty2000	Okay, now I'll try to end the day to see what happens
2016-06-11 13:52:11	Marty2000	Hmm... no death is reported at the end of the day
2016-06-11 13:52:34	@Espyo	!
2016-06-11 13:52:40	@Espyo	well, there might be seeds at the end of the day
2016-06-11 13:52:45	Marty2000	But I wonder if the Candypop Bud spat out seeds? There's nothing on the REPLAY scren
2016-06-11 13:52:47	@Espyo	ugh, this kind of stuff terrifies me for the engine
2016-06-11 13:52:48	Marty2000	screen*
2016-06-11 13:52:53	@Espyo	all of these little specific scenarios
2016-06-11 13:52:56	Marty2000	Ok, let's check the next day
2016-06-11 13:53:22	@Espyo	wait, did it report a decrease in the number of...whatever Pikmin you put in?
2016-06-11 13:53:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-11 13:53:43	Marty2000	(Winged Pikmin)
2016-06-11 13:53:44	Marty2000	-3
2016-06-11 13:53:50	@Espyo	and an increase in <other type>?
2016-06-11 13:53:58	Marty2000	Nothing
2016-06-11 13:54:04	@Espyo	oh...
2016-06-11 13:54:07	Marty2000	I'm going to see if there are sprouts
2016-06-11 13:54:20	@Espyo	hehe, so a decrease in numbers that doesn't get accounted as death...
2016-06-11 13:54:23	Marty2000	I should mention that I skipped the sunset cutscene too
2016-06-11 13:54:25	@Espyo	can't wait to see how an extinction will react to this
2016-06-11 13:54:31	@Espyo	hm, that could have an impact, yes
2016-06-11 13:54:33	@Espyo	but I doubt it
2016-06-11 13:54:52	Marty2000	!
2016-06-11 13:54:55	Marty2000	No srpouts!
2016-06-11 13:54:58	Marty2000	sprouts*
2016-06-11 13:54:59	@Espyo	hah!
2016-06-11 13:55:03	Marty2000	So I lost my Pikmin
2016-06-11 13:55:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-11 13:55:11	@Espyo	and they haven't been accounted for as deaths...
2016-06-11 13:55:18	Marty2000	That could be so... great for speedruns!
2016-06-11 13:55:26	@Espyo	hmm? how so?
2016-06-11 13:55:47	Marty2000	Well, not so great, but I mean, you can use that to decrease your number of Pikmin
2016-06-11 13:55:52	Marty2000	without counting them as dead
2016-06-11 13:56:11	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-11 13:56:15	@Espyo	!
2016-06-11 13:56:18	@Espyo	get a one-Pikmin completion
2016-06-11 13:56:30	@Espyo	oh, it might count the births still, though
2016-06-11 13:56:35	Marty2000	I'll try to do that in a few minutes
2016-06-11 13:56:39	Marty2000	It doesn't in P3, I think
2016-06-11 13:58:00	Marty2000	So, Pikmin 3 counts 
2016-06-11 13:58:07	Marty2000	Pikmin remaining at the end
2016-06-11 13:58:09	Marty2000	Pikmin who perished
2016-06-11 13:58:18	Marty2000	I've just beaten the Plasm Wraith to verify
2016-06-11 13:59:03	Marty2000	So you could theoretically finish the game with a single Pikmin
2016-06-11 14:01:02	Marty2000	Started a new savefile
2016-06-11 14:01:05	Marty2000	save*
2016-06-11 14:01:08	@Espyo	hehe, new challenge get!
2016-06-11 14:01:13	Marty2000	Yep!
2016-06-11 14:01:16	@Espyo	I guess you can only do 5 Pikmin at a time, though
2016-06-11 14:01:21	@Espyo	so manage your fruits/days carefully
2016-06-11 14:01:24	Marty2000	4
2016-06-11 14:01:34	@Espyo	oh, won't it work with five?
2016-06-11 14:01:39	@Espyo	before it spits?
2016-06-11 14:01:53	Marty2000	I don't think, it automatically spit the seeds when 5 Pikmin are thrown in
2016-06-11 14:02:07	Marty2000	It does after a few seconds with few Pikmin
2016-06-11 14:02:09	Marty2000	fewer*
2016-06-11 14:02:39	@Espyo	well yeah, but there might be a window of time where it works
2016-06-11 14:02:53	Marty2000	Possible. I might try as well
2016-06-11 14:07:51	UltraMario	o

2016-06-11 14:21:43	Marty2000	I wonder how many Purple Pikmin would be required to push a carboard box or an iron ball
2016-06-11 14:21:48	Marty2000	I'd say 1 and two
2016-06-11 14:22:10	Marty2000	But since it's not possible in-game, maybe it could be also 10 and 20
2016-06-11 14:24:49	UltraMario	:o
2016-06-11 14:41:15	@Espyo	I'd say 10 and 20
2016-06-11 14:41:24	@Espyo	sorry, 1 and 2
2016-06-11 14:41:30	@Espyo	if the DLC didn't exist, then 10 and 20
2016-06-11 14:41:45	@Espyo	they likely wrote the "main" Pikmin types and story mode first
2016-06-11 14:41:57	@Espyo	then they wrote Purples and Whites, and the Mission Mode levels at the same time
2016-06-11 14:42:08	@Espyo	and they knew they wouldn't include boxes or iron balls
2016-06-11 14:42:16	@Espyo	so they didn't bother coding in a "strength" modifier
2016-06-11 14:42:19	@Espyo	but, since DLC is a thing
2016-06-11 14:42:37	@Espyo	they figured "we might need to add a stage in the future that does have one of those objects AND Purple Pikmin, so let's code a modifier"
2016-06-11 14:43:08	Marty2000	Yeah, that's possible

2016-06-11 15:13:02	@Espyo	ooh
2016-06-11 15:13:11	@Espyo	what's the count?
2016-06-11 15:14:42	Marty2000	I have 41 Pikmin right now
2016-06-11 15:14:47	Marty2000	And I'll have a Blue Pikmin then
2016-06-11 15:14:50	Marty2000	So 42 in total
2016-06-11 15:15:00	Marty2000	And before fighting the Plasm Wraith, I'll use the Candypop Buds
2016-06-11 15:20:15	@Espyo	right
2016-06-11 15:55:01	Marty2000	I'll continue later, I'm in the Garden of Hope ready to fight the Quaggled Mireclops

2016-06-11 16:25:13	@Espyo	scroll down a bit
2016-06-11 16:25:25	@Espyo	check it out, this player is getting the same journal entry every time
2016-06-11 16:28:25	Marty2000	Yeah, it's the same for me
2016-06-11 16:28:33	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-11 16:28:34	Marty2000	It's "normal"
2016-06-11 16:28:36	@Espyo	well then
2016-06-11 16:28:50	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0Z5Iv7SWg love it when people don't explain how they get this stuff to happen, ugh
2016-06-11 16:29:01	Marty2000	Well, by normal, I mean you will always get the same journal entries around those days unless something oimportant happens
2016-06-11 16:29:07	@Espyo	right
2016-06-11 16:29:17	Marty2000	I'll explain you with a video then, I know how to do that :p
2016-06-11 16:29:49	Marty2000	But basically, you can get out of bounds here
2016-06-11 16:29:53	Marty2000	(by using the flowerpot)
2016-06-11 16:30:16	Marty2000	It's similar to what you in the Twilight River to get out of bounds and access the Pink Onion

2016-06-11 16:58:50	CreativeSushi	Hey so
2016-06-11 16:59:09	CreativeSushi	did we ever figure out how to join the pikmin speedrunning discord?
2016-06-11 16:59:11	CreativeSushi	are you in it?
2016-06-11 16:59:24	@Espyo	we just ask them if it's ok to invite people
2016-06-11 16:59:26	@Espyo	and then get the invite link
2016-06-11 16:59:35	CreativeSushi	Ask who?
2016-06-11 17:00:02	@Espyo	the guys on the Discord chat
2016-06-11 17:00:15	CreativeSushi	But I don't know who they are ;,;
2016-06-11 17:00:25	@Espyo	no, we ask them :|
2016-06-11 17:00:35	@Espyo	we, as in, the people already in it
2016-06-11 17:00:43	CreativeSushi	Oh your in it?
2016-06-11 17:00:47	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-11 17:00:51	CreativeSushi	oh ok
2016-06-11 17:01:10	CreativeSushi	sweet, if your able to do that you can just skype me the link 
2016-06-11 17:01:24	@Espyo	all right, I'll talk to them next time I can
2016-06-11 17:01:27	@Espyo	if I remember :/
2016-06-11 17:01:42	CreativeSushi	which pikmin game do they speedrun mostly?
2016-06-11 17:01:46	CreativeSushi	and thanks
2016-06-11 17:01:52	Marty2000	All of them
2016-06-11 17:01:53	@Espyo	all of them, really
2016-06-11 17:01:58	CreativeSushi	coolio
2016-06-11 17:02:02	@Espyo	but MOSTLY? I guess P2
2016-06-11 17:02:07	@Espyo	I think the chat is pretty recent
2016-06-11 17:02:08	Marty2000	Even though it's mostly P2 and P3
2016-06-11 17:02:09	@Espyo	like, 2 weeks or so
2016-06-11 17:02:13	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-11 17:02:14	@Espyo	so I can't really tell what they do the most
2016-06-11 17:02:16	@Espyo	but yeah, P2 or P3
2016-06-11 17:02:31	CreativeSushi	alright cool
2016-06-11 17:04:02	Yoshi2	i want an invite (っ◕‿◕)っ 
2016-06-11 17:04:21	Yoshi2	I don't do much pikmin stuff nowadays, but that stuff is still interesting
2016-06-11 17:05:24	@Espyo	right
2016-06-11 17:05:27	@Espyo	I'll talk to them
2016-06-11 17:05:43	@Espyo	I understand they may want a chat focused on actually speedrunning, discovering tips, and figuring out strats
2016-06-11 17:05:55	@Espyo	not so much a big chat where you talk about a lot of stuff, but centered around speedrunning
2016-06-11 17:06:09	CreativeSushi	oh no, I just want to do speedrunning
2016-06-11 17:06:09	@Espyo	so maybe they can create a public group, where people join at will, and talk at will, but mostly about speedrunning
2016-06-11 17:06:10	CreativeSushi	I already do
2016-06-11 17:06:18	@Espyo	and have private rooms for hardcore tips and all?
2016-06-11 17:06:25	Yoshi2	that's just a matter of rules
2016-06-11 17:06:30	@Espyo	guess so
2016-06-11 17:06:44	@Espyo	but if people want to join because "eh, speedruns are cool, but I've got nothing to contribute to the conversation"
2016-06-11 17:06:50	@Espyo	then it could get a bit crowded...
2016-06-11 17:06:53	@Espyo	but either way, I'll ask
2016-06-11 17:07:00	@Espyo	I might boot up Discord in an hour (Splatfest)
2016-06-11 17:07:03	@Espyo	so I'll do it then
2016-06-11 17:07:21	CreativeSushi	wait what splatfest?
2016-06-11 17:07:22	Yoshi2	if they want to keep all their speedrun tips to themselves,
2016-06-11 17:07:25	Yoshi2	that would be pretty shitty
2016-06-11 17:07:26	CreativeSushi	is there a splatfest happining?
2016-06-11 17:07:30	@Espyo	European Splatfest
2016-06-11 17:07:34	CreativeSushi	ah
2016-06-11 17:07:38	@Espyo	travel the Earth vs visiting space
2016-06-11 17:07:45	@Espyo	guess so
2016-06-11 17:07:57	Marty2000	Yes it is
2016-06-11 17:08:10	@Espyo	but if they're scared of newbies coming along and asking "how do I doed the blue pimin skip in new play wii pimin 2????"
2016-06-11 17:08:13	Marty2000	Expyo, did you buy one of the new weapons, by the way?
2016-06-11 17:08:19	@Espyo	then I can imagine them being thrown off
2016-06-11 17:08:29	@Espyo	decided to buy them all one day
2016-06-11 17:08:34	@Espyo	I had like 40 weapons left to buy
2016-06-11 17:08:35	Marty2000	Haah
2016-06-11 17:08:39	@Espyo	took me 5 minutes to buy them all
2016-06-11 17:08:43	@Espyo	and a third of my money :X
2016-06-11 17:08:44	Marty2000	Great
2016-06-11 17:08:49	Marty2000	He he
2016-06-11 17:09:04	Yoshi2	they should make a FAQ about that stuff, or a resource of all cool pikmin tricks everybody should know
2016-06-11 17:09:07	Yoshi2	point people to that
2016-06-11 17:09:08	@Espyo	now my inventory is like half squares with "NEW!" on them
2016-06-11 17:09:14	@Espyo	yeah, good idea
2016-06-11 17:09:15	Yoshi2	and otherwise ban them if they don't listen
2016-06-11 17:09:26	@Espyo	I guess they didn't expect it to get that much attention
2016-06-11 17:09:31	@Espyo	that's why they didn't think of it
2016-06-11 17:11:25	Marty2000	From what I know, they're pretty much very focused on trying to find trick for speedrunning, that has been our only discussion since the start
2016-06-11 17:11:31	Marty2000	tricks*
2016-06-11 17:11:40	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-06-11 17:13:13	Yoshi2	well, if they want to keep noobs out, I don't mind as long as I am in the exclusive club :^)
2016-06-11 17:14:12	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-11 17:16:17	Yoshi2	I am already happy as long as people older than 12 come into the BW discord, so my standards are lower
2016-06-11 17:16:31	@Espyo	heh, good point

2016-06-11 17:58:47	@Espyo	yay
2016-06-11 17:58:50	@Espyo	hopping on
2016-06-11 18:00:46	Marty2000	If you were going to try the Bento Splatterscope or Splat Charger, you will be happy when you see the stages (I think)
2016-06-11 18:01:07	@Espyo	hmm, tricky map rotation
2016-06-11 18:01:10	@Espyo	not quite sure what to go with
2016-06-11 18:01:19	@Espyo	yeah, I think snipers will work best here
2016-06-11 18:01:24	@Espyo	but not so much for inking
2016-06-11 18:01:29	Marty2000	I've taken the Custom Hydra Splatling
2016-06-11 18:01:35	@Espyo	well, I'll try them for a bit
2016-06-11 18:05:00	Marty2000	Lost my first match and sniped behind walls too :p
2016-06-11 18:05:11	Marty2000	Oh, I actually won...
2016-06-11 18:05:12	Marty2000	But...
2016-06-11 18:05:17	Marty2000	I had the "Danger" thing
2016-06-11 18:06:12	@Espyo	we had them in danger for half the match
2016-06-11 18:06:14	@Espyo	then they turned it around
2016-06-11 18:06:26	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-11 18:06:28	@Espyo	I scored highest in my team with a charger
2016-06-11 18:06:31	@Espyo	off to a great start
2016-06-11 18:07:02	Marty2000	I feel like there aren't many people in our team... I have to wait a lot
2016-06-11 18:07:16	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-11 18:10:41	@Espyo	they had a disconnect and we just BARELY won
2016-06-11 18:10:50	Marty2000	1% loss
2016-06-11 18:10:55	Marty2000	We had them in danger
2016-06-11 18:10:57	@Espyo	ugh, if I don't want to spend 50 hours here, I have to be more of an inker than this
2016-06-11 18:11:00	Marty2000	But they eventually won :/
2016-06-11 18:11:01	@Espyo	since my team won't ink
2016-06-11 18:11:03	@Espyo	ugh
2016-06-11 18:11:06	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-11 18:11:24	Marty2000	I'm waiting alone for 50 seconds already
2016-06-11 18:11:37	@Espyo	I'm finding people easily, though
2016-06-11 18:11:45	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-11 18:11:51	Marty2000	Which isn't my case :p
2016-06-11 18:12:10	Marty2000	... Not enough players joined the battle....
2016-06-11 18:15:26	@Espyo	really weird
2016-06-11 18:16:09	Marty2000	I have a disconnection in my team...
2016-06-11 18:16:54	Marty2000	I hope everything is okay for your team
2016-06-11 18:20:10	@Espyo	nope
2016-06-11 18:20:13	@Espyo	they're retarded
2016-06-11 18:20:16	@Espyo	I got 1250+ points
2016-06-11 18:20:18	@Espyo	we lost
2016-06-11 18:21:49	Marty2000	That's a catastrophe too, heh
2016-06-11 18:22:07	Marty2000	+1200 easily with my Splattershot

2016-06-11 18:22:32	Marty2000	I wish we could join friends, that's really something they should add...
2016-06-11 18:25:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-11 18:40:42	Marty2000	Finally, I win a match

2016-06-11 18:44:42	@Espyo	and we lost

2016-06-11 18:44:54	Marty2000	:/
2016-06-11 18:44:58	@Espyo	I swear this is on purpose
2016-06-11 18:45:00	Marty2000	I feel like our teams are bad overall
2016-06-11 18:45:12	@Espyo	the game purposely pairs me up with cats that accidentally turned on the game and are sitting on the controller
2016-06-11 18:45:27	Marty2000	:)

2016-06-11 18:46:28	Marty2000	Like... "Empire"
2016-06-11 18:48:58	@Espyo	ugh
2016-06-11 18:49:07	@Espyo	so you can't even quit out and get a different team
2016-06-11 18:50:00	Marty2000	That's just a nightmare
2016-06-11 18:50:04	Marty2000	Lol 
2016-06-11 18:52:34	Marty2000	Another person I keep meeting is "Randomized"
2016-06-11 18:52:49	Marty2000	Not to mention the many people with "Cst"
2016-06-11 18:54:03	@Espyo	huh, weird pattern
2016-06-11 18:56:14	Marty2000	5%
2016-06-11 18:58:49	@Espyo	lost?
2016-06-11 19:00:30	Marty2000	Of course
2016-06-11 19:01:52	Marty2000	Finally, I win a match
2016-06-11 19:02:09	Marty2000	I have been meeting a lot of snipers, is it your case?
2016-06-11 19:03:23	@Espyo	not really, actually
2016-06-11 19:03:27	@Espyo	like 0.8 per room
2016-06-11 19:03:28	@Espyo	...average
2016-06-11 19:03:33	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-11 19:05:10	@Espyo	oh, found a *Cst
2016-06-11 19:05:37	Marty2000	He he
2016-06-11 19:06:16	Marty2000	What is their name?
2016-06-11 19:07:59	Marty2000	Schemiep Cst in my current team (that I'll leave)

2016-06-11 20:21:53	@Espyo	my team lost to a 3v4
2016-06-11 20:21:58	@Espyo	the other team already started with 3 players
2016-06-11 20:22:02	@Espyo	and we lost
2016-06-11 20:22:05	Marty2000	Happened to me too
2016-06-11 20:22:08	@Espyo	absolutely not
2016-06-11 20:22:12	@Espyo	I am not continuing this Splatfest
2016-06-11 20:22:20	Marty2000	It's a horrible Splatfest
2016-06-11 20:22:25	@Espyo	even if I'm told I'll get infinite SSS if I play one more
2016-06-11 20:22:29	@Espyo	you know what?

2016-06-11 20:22:39	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-11 20:22:40	@Espyo	instead of the team of the choice I pick
2016-06-11 20:22:55	@Espyo	I wanted to play Splatfest in the spirit of it
2016-06-11 20:22:57	@Espyo	but this is not excusable
2016-06-11 20:22:59	@Espyo	this wasn't just bad
2016-06-11 20:23:01	@Espyo	this was the worst
2016-06-11 20:23:11	Marty2000	I agree for it being the worst
2016-06-11 20:23:15	Marty2000	That's so horrible
2016-06-11 20:23:25	@Espyo	I'm playing something else to calm my nerves
2016-06-11 20:23:27	@Espyo	no more rage
2016-06-11 20:23:29	@Espyo	only good-quality games

2016-06-11 20:24:52	Yoshi2	was slightly disappointed
2016-06-11 20:25:26	Marty2000	I might do something else, starting to get bored 
2016-06-11 20:26:45	Marty2000	Please, my teammate says "nice" when we get killed, but he's the last of my team 
2016-06-11 20:27:13	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-11 20:27:55	Marty2000	I'm stopping here, I'll see if I continue tomorrow. I'll check my recordings to say how many Cst I've met so far :p

2016-06-11 20:51:25	@Espyo	I wonder what's going on
2016-06-11 20:51:38	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-11 20:51:51	Marty2000	That's basically what happens each time I play during Splatfests
2016-06-11 20:52:02	@Espyo	hm, can't tell if I get the same, but just don't remember
2016-06-11 20:52:09	Marty2000	I'll check if I recorded other Splatfests, I'm sure I have met a lot of Cst before

2016-06-11 22:50:13	Klemen702	and to do that you need to be in atleast 1 server
2016-06-11 22:50:14	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-11 22:50:18	Klemen702	you can't search for people

2016-06-11 22:51:12	@PikFan	and discord is the easiest way to do it :P

2016-06-11 23:49:48	Marty2000	We could also try getting as many points as we can with Inkbrushes

2016-06-11 23:57:49	Marty2000	I didn't know SplatnNet, it's such a great tool...; especially when you want to spy people :p

2016-06-12 00:21:37	Marty2000	(somehow, what I said reminds me of SOnic Heroes)
2016-06-12 00:21:37	@PikFan	will they party with us? or have they come with hostile intentions?
2016-06-12 00:21:43	Marty2000	I don't know :p
2016-06-12 00:21:48	Marty2000	This is what we're going to find out

2016-06-12 00:27:27	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-12 00:27:38	@PikFan	that one guy at the beginning kept trying to get the rainmaker
2016-06-12 00:27:48	@PikFan	but then he started partying with us after we kept splatting him

2016-06-12 00:34:12	Marty2000	Espyo: what if Testyo likes Tabuu? You couldn't ban him :p
2016-06-12 00:34:12	Testyo	and so far, saw absolutely no template categorized incorrectly on the skype group

2016-06-12 00:34:48	Marty2000	Testyo may not agree, he he
2016-06-12 00:34:48	Testyo	joop time you code it, something is DEFINITELY wrong
2016-06-12 00:38:27	Marty2000	He he
2016-06-12 00:38:27	@PikFan	lol Marty
2016-06-12 00:38:37	@PikFan	you gave me a Bubbler when we passed each other midair
2016-06-12 00:38:41	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-12 00:38:45	@PikFan	that was funny
2016-06-12 00:39:05	Marty2000	Yeah, I loved it
2016-06-12 00:40:06	Marty2000	He keeps killing me! Ahh!
2016-06-12 00:40:18	@PikFan	Apple Dog?
2016-06-12 00:40:22	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-12 00:40:25	@PikFan	:|
2016-06-12 00:40:36	@PikFan	I think we should close the room after this
2016-06-12 00:40:40	@PikFan	this is getting out of hand
2016-06-12 00:41:35	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-12 00:42:41	Marty2000	Tatsu... why :/
2016-06-12 00:42:53	@PikFan	did Tatsu kill you too?
2016-06-12 00:43:09	 *	Marty2000 suicides (and makes UltraMario happy too)
2016-06-12 00:43:16	Marty2000	Yeah, but maybe it was by accident
2016-06-12 00:43:22	@PikFan	yay
2016-06-12 00:43:25	@PikFan	room's closed
2016-06-12 00:43:36	@PikFan	no more party-hating squids
2016-06-12 00:43:46	@PikFan	see, that's what makes me upset
2016-06-12 00:43:57	Marty2000	I understand
2016-06-12 00:44:00	@PikFan	because the people who hate squid parties say "do it in private battles"
2016-06-12 00:44:14	@PikFan	but even still, people come into private battles and mess things up
2016-06-12 00:44:20	@PikFan	we could put in a password, sure
2016-06-12 00:44:22	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-12 00:44:27	@PikFan	but it's just not fun that way
2016-06-12 00:44:35	@PikFan	so if we can't do it in private battles...
2016-06-12 00:44:40	@PikFan	then where are we supposed to do it?
2016-06-12 00:45:12	@PikFan	I'm sorry, but you're telling me you really can't be bothered to quit the group you're in and join another one, just because of some party squids?
2016-06-12 00:45:12	Marty2000	We should do it wherever we want because we have the right to play the game as we want without people judging how or what we should play
2016-06-12 00:45:14	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-12 00:45:15	@PikFan	that's dumb
2016-06-12 00:45:20	@PikFan	exactly
2016-06-12 00:45:30	@PikFan	they say, "play the game how it was meant to be played"
2016-06-12 00:45:42	@PikFan	but
2016-06-12 00:45:47	@PikFan	lots of people don't
2016-06-12 00:45:56	@PikFan	what are you going to do? cry?
2016-06-12 00:45:58	@PikFan	oh boo-hoo
2016-06-12 00:46:01	@PikFan	nobody cares
2016-06-12 00:46:14	@PikFan	nobody cares that you want people to play it like it was meant to be played
2016-06-12 00:46:22	@PikFan	if anything, the point is to HAVE FUN
2016-06-12 00:46:34	@PikFan	not my problem that you're too stuck-up to realize that
2016-06-12 00:46:39	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-12 00:46:58	 *	@PikFan sighs
2016-06-12 00:47:01	Marty2000	It's just too bad that the majority of people probably think "play how it was meant to be played"
2016-06-12 00:47:08	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-12 00:47:09	Marty2000	We can see the consequences in Super Smash Bros
2016-06-12 00:47:14	Marty2000	on*
2016-06-12 00:47:15	@PikFan	it's called being flexible
2016-06-12 00:47:19	@PikFan	get used to it
2016-06-12 00:47:25	@PikFan	you might make some pleasant surprises
2016-06-12 00:47:51	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-12 00:48:10	@PikFan	for the record, I'm not ranting at you, I'm just ranting at all the haters :P
2016-06-12 00:48:16	@PikFan	because I keep using "you"
2016-06-12 00:48:26	@PikFan	but you knew that
2016-06-12 00:48:28	Marty2000	Yes, I know
2016-06-12 00:48:32	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-12 00:48:33	Marty2000	I do that too
2016-06-12 00:49:48	Marty2000	Be right back
2016-06-12 00:49:57	@PikFan	okay
2016-06-12 00:55:16	Marty2000	Back
2016-06-12 00:55:43	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User_talk:TabuuandPeach#Latest_events Espyo, did you see that
2016-06-12 00:55:44	Marty2000	?
2016-06-12 00:55:54	@Espyo	yeah, I replied already
2016-06-12 00:56:12	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-12 00:56:13	Marty2000	Oh I see. 
2016-06-12 00:56:16	@Espyo	well, I didn't reply to his reply
2016-06-12 00:57:18	Marty2000	"I will help the wiki in return" I hope I'm wrong, but usually, when someones asks you "do X before I do Y", only "do X" is realized :p
2016-06-12 00:58:25	@Espyo	it looks like blackmail
2016-06-12 00:58:28	@Espyo	he better have another thing coming
2016-06-12 00:58:45	@Espyo	I'm the one that decides what to do with those images, not him
2016-06-12 00:58:50	@Espyo	he has no control over images any more
2016-06-12 00:59:58	Marty2000	Oh, so you can disallow him from posting any more images?
2016-06-12 01:00:10	Marty2000	Or did you simply say that because you warned him?
2016-06-12 01:00:18	@Espyo	I can't
2016-06-12 01:00:20	@Espyo	the latter
2016-06-12 01:00:23	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-12 01:06:59	@PikFan	ugh, come on people https://plus.google.com/110109388057142837658/posts/W1AMP9PL3ot?pid=6291777274157120018&oid=110109388057142837658
2016-06-12 01:07:11	@PikFan	I seriously doubt that Louie is the President's son
2016-06-12 01:07:27	@PikFan	the President probably used "son" because he's a lot older than Louie

2016-06-12 11:04:12	Marty2000	Yoshi2: on a scale of one to ten, how much does UltraMario deserve my "Hello"? :p
2016-06-12 11:06:22	Marty2000	Dark Lord Revan merged "Captain Olimar" and "Olimar as a Pikmin", and deleted the latter article... the problem is that we will have another problem
2016-06-12 11:06:25	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Captain_Olimar#References
2016-06-12 11:06:33	Marty2000	Look at the "Characters" infobox
2016-06-12 11:06:42	Marty2000	There is still "Olimar as a Pikmin"
2016-06-12 11:06:46	Marty2000	But it links to nohing
2016-06-12 11:07:50	Yoshi2	rip
2016-06-12 11:08:01	Yoshi2	make Olimar as a Pikmin a redirect to Olimar?
2016-06-12 11:08:13	Yoshi2	assuming the two really should be merged
2016-06-12 11:08:22	Yoshi2	or ask espyo when he is back
2016-06-12 11:08:47	Marty2000	Yeah, that's what I'll do
2016-06-12 11:09:01	Marty2000	For the time being, I'll follow your advice and make a redirect, that's a great idea ;)
2016-06-12 11:09:06	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-06-12 11:09:23	Marty2000	But to be honest, I don't know if the two had to be merged
2016-06-12 11:09:29	Marty2000	There was a tag, sure
2016-06-12 11:09:46	Marty2000	And the article was short
2016-06-12 11:10:02	Marty2000	But well... it can be considered as a different character or another form of Olimar :p
2016-06-12 11:11:46	Marty2000	TabuuandPeach is close to being banned too
2016-06-12 11:12:11	Marty2000	He blackmails Espyo :p

2016-06-12 12:01:43	Marty2000	Well, Kirby is not that popular outside of Japan... but well, that's sad :/
2016-06-12 12:02:59	UltraMario	nah

2016-06-12 12:03:08	UltraMario	he just has a silent fanbase

2016-06-12 13:13:07	Marty2000	So since in the Characters box, there's still "Olimar as a Pikmin"... Yoshi2 and I thought we'd make a redirect and then tell you about that

2016-06-12 13:14:10	@Espyo	in all truthfullness, I don't think the page should even EXIST
2016-06-12 13:14:13	@Espyo	it's not a character
2016-06-12 13:14:15	@Espyo	it's Olimar
2016-06-12 13:14:21	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-12 13:14:25	@Espyo	Olimar after being absorbed by an Onion on a non-canon ending
2016-06-12 13:14:31	@Espyo	at the most, it deserves a mention as one sentence somewhere
2016-06-12 13:14:36	@Espyo	thoughts?
2016-06-12 13:14:47	Yoshi2	Espyo: for some reason #tcrf is saying to switch to  irc.badnik.zone
2016-06-12 13:15:03	@Espyo	for now, or from here on out?
2016-06-12 13:15:29	Yoshi2	from here on out, I guess
2016-06-12 13:15:34	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:RecentChanges for more information
2016-06-12 13:16:00	Marty2000	Also, [[Glitches in Pikmin 3]]

2016-06-12 13:16:23	Marty2000	Orange Bulborb corpse stuck under a bridge (2)
2016-06-12 13:16:26	Yoshi2	Espyo: rip badnik.net?
2016-06-12 13:16:44	@Espyo	well then
2016-06-12 13:16:44	Marty2000	Dark Lord Revan added "Stuck under a bridge!" because TabuuandPeach asked him some time ago :p
2016-06-12 13:16:58	Marty2000	But it's actually the same "glitch"
2016-06-12 13:17:07	Marty2000	(and sorry for disturbing you, I should have waited)
2016-06-12 13:17:13	@Espyo	well, time for DLR to learn that you don't just come here after several years and start bossing around
2016-06-12 13:17:19	@Espyo	we don't DO patriarchy
2016-06-12 13:17:24	@Espyo	that's what made us leave the wikia in the first place
2016-06-12 13:17:28	Yoshi2	for the moment, seems irc.badnik.net doesn't point to the irc server
2016-06-12 13:17:48	@Espyo	right, I'll take care of it in a bit
2016-06-12 13:17:49	@Espyo	thanks, Marty
2016-06-12 13:17:59	@Espyo	Yoshi2: I'll try .zone then
2016-06-12 13:18:01	@Espyo	let's see...
2016-06-12 13:18:03	Marty2000	No problem
2016-06-12 13:18:27	Yoshi2	[14:17:42] <Yoshi2> odd, I wonder what happened to badnik.net
2016-06-12 13:18:27	Yoshi2	[14:18:03] <vaguerant> Attempted sabotage of the server from a former admin.
2016-06-12 13:18:27	Yoshi2	[14:18:07] <Flygon> tl;dr - Politicial shitstorm
2016-06-12 13:18:28	Testyo	Only Mario Kart Wii can induce such language.
2016-06-12 13:18:46	Yoshi2	[14:18:26] <vaguerant> In the divorce, we got the server, they got the domain name.
2016-06-12 13:18:52	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-12 13:19:12	@Espyo	well, that works
2016-06-12 13:19:14	@Espyo	moving on...

2016-06-12 13:26:03	@Espyo	let's count the number of things wrong here
2016-06-12 13:26:13	@Espyo	a) why did KB decide to wake up and mess about with a talk page?
2016-06-12 13:26:25	@Espyo	b) how did he NOT KNOW THAT DISTANT TUNDRA REMIX WAS A THING
2016-06-12 13:26:30	@Espyo	mister "walking Pikmin encyclopedia"
2016-06-12 13:26:40	@Espyo	c) that span makes the font normal... despite the fact that it's already normal
2016-06-12 13:26:48	@Espyo	just...wow
2016-06-12 13:27:18	Yoshi2	are you telling me that guy knows jack about pikmin
2016-06-12 13:27:21	Yoshi2	i am truly shocked
2016-06-12 13:27:31	@Espyo	truly and utterly
2016-06-12 13:27:46	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-12 13:27:59	UltraMario	"You have been kicked from #tcrf by CopyX (This channel may not be used.)"
2016-06-12 13:28:05	UltraMario	Espyo that happened to me too
2016-06-12 13:28:06	UltraMario	:|
2016-06-12 13:28:11	UltraMario	did something happen to badnik?
2016-06-12 13:28:18	UltraMario	was there a falling out
2016-06-12 13:28:18	Yoshi2	UltraMario: scroll up

2016-06-12 13:28:23	UltraMario	:p
2016-06-12 13:29:07	UltraMario	so wait
2016-06-12 13:29:11	UltraMario	will it not come back?
2016-06-12 13:29:12	UltraMario	:|
2016-06-12 13:29:25	Marty2000	Scroll down :p
2016-06-12 13:29:30	UltraMario	pls
2016-06-12 13:30:41	Yoshi2	if they had a fallout, the original domain won't come back
2016-06-12 13:31:14	Yoshi2	the server is still up though under irc.badnik.zone
2016-06-12 13:34:09	Marty2000	By the way, hmm, I don't know whether it's normal or not, but sometimes, the name of the article I'm searching for doesn't appear in the search bar (for example, if I write "Distant", only Distant Tundra appears) 
2016-06-12 13:34:18	Marty2000	Distant Tundra remix doesn't appear
2016-06-12 13:34:42	@Espyo	yeah, I think Porple has to rebuild the search suggestion cache or some such
2016-06-12 13:34:49	Marty2000	I see, thanks.

2016-06-12 14:16:46	Marty2000	My theory  about his behaviour: he hasn't slept at all, so he is starting to see imaginary people

2016-06-12 14:28:52	Marty2000	Testyo will UltraMario bother helping me y/n
2016-06-12 14:28:52	Testyo	Yeah.
2016-06-12 14:28:58	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-12 14:38:38	Marty2000	Hmm, Espyo... you know, when you approach Pellet Posies, geysers or Candypop Buds in P1, the music changes a little (enemy variation)
2016-06-12 14:38:57	@Espyo	mhm
2016-06-12 14:39:01	@Espyo	[[Enemy#Trivia]], IIRC
2016-06-12 14:39:01	Testyo	"Enemy#Trivia" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Enemy#Trivia
2016-06-12 14:39:07	Marty2000	But... if a Pikmin dies from drowning, and you approach the point where it drowned... the music also changes
2016-06-12 14:39:44	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Candypop_family#Trivia Here
2016-06-12 14:39:52	Marty2000	"In Pikmin, Candypop Buds are technically bosses. As such, approaching them will change the area's music to the battle variant."
2016-06-12 14:42:13	Marty2000	That's really strange, because even if you get far away, the music will change again when you come back to the place where they drowned...
2016-06-12 14:49:16	@Espyo	woah...
2016-06-12 14:49:19	@Espyo	that's actually pretty scary
2016-06-12 14:49:57	Marty2000	Heh, yeah
2016-06-12 14:50:05	Marty2000	It's likely a glitch according to me
2016-06-12 14:50:57	Marty2000	Actually, it seems to disappear if you get really far (other side of the map)
2016-06-12 14:51:28	@Espyo	you sure it doesn't just disappear with time?
2016-06-12 14:51:34	@Espyo	and to me, it doesn't seem like a glitch
2016-06-12 14:51:43	@Espyo	I can't tell what sort of code or behavior would make that happen
2016-06-12 14:51:49	@Espyo	seems on purpose, like "this body of water is DANGEROUS"
2016-06-12 14:52:37	Marty2000	The music only changes once the Pikmin has died
2016-06-12 14:52:43	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-12 14:53:30	Marty2000	I must do more science ( Yoshi2 ;), I'll try in a few minutes, after retrieving every ship part of the Forest of Hope.
2016-06-12 14:53:39	@Espyo	all right
2016-06-12 14:53:42	Marty2000	Feel free to tell me what I should test
2016-06-12 14:53:50	@Espyo	honestly, I've got no ideas
2016-06-12 14:54:10	@Espyo	maybe test on a huge body of water (The Distant Spring) and a tiny one (uh... the body of water that leads to the Armored Cannon Beetle?)
2016-06-12 14:54:20	@Espyo	(does that path even have water, or am I thinking of Pikmin 2?)
2016-06-12 14:57:20	Marty2000	Yeah, there's one in P1
2016-06-12 14:57:21	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-12 14:57:28	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-12 14:59:12	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-12 15:02:32	@Espyo	yeah, just as I thought
2016-06-12 15:02:41	@Espyo	DLR is only touching the wiki now to give off the idea that he's active, and that he cares
2016-06-12 15:02:43	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Dark_Lord_Revan&curid=4625&diff=166672&oldid=160399
2016-06-12 15:02:57	@Espyo	he since reverted that because the tag he already had already says he's an active bureaucrat
2016-06-12 15:03:05	@Espyo	but still, his idea is to get the point across that "I'm active!"
2016-06-12 15:03:07	@Espyo	ugh
2016-06-12 15:03:12	UltraMario	o
2016-06-12 15:03:13	UltraMario	Marty2000: 
2016-06-12 15:03:16	UltraMario	wat is it
2016-06-12 15:03:22	@Espyo	he feels like the world owes him favors because he clicked "Create a new Wikia" several years back
2016-06-12 15:03:45	--	sleepi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-06-12 15:07:12	Marty2000	Espyo: I can already tell that the music only changes once two Pikmin drowned at once and at the same point
2016-06-12 15:07:18	Marty2000	(testing in the Forest of Hope)
2016-06-12 15:07:24	Marty2000	I'll try to get far and come back)
2016-06-12 15:07:28	Marty2000	.*
2016-06-12 15:07:41	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-12 15:09:13	Marty2000	Getting far and coming back actually doesn't change anything (last time, I wasn't at the right point)
2016-06-12 15:09:28	Marty2000	So, when coming back to where they drowned, the music changes again...
2016-06-12 15:09:43	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-12 15:10:22	UltraMario	???
2016-06-12 15:10:24	Marty2000	What if other Pikmin drown somewhere else? Will the new "point" erase the last one?
2016-06-12 15:10:31	Marty2000	UltraMario: Pikmin science ;)
2016-06-12 15:10:51	@Espyo	good question
2016-06-12 15:10:54	UltraMario	heh
2016-06-12 15:11:49	Marty2000	If other Pikmin drown somehwere else, it will keep the last place and new place in memory
2016-06-12 15:13:09	@Espyo	so only the last two places?
2016-06-12 15:13:13	Marty2000	So each time Pikmin drown somehwere, the game will remember where they drown and play the battle variation of the music when coming back where the Pikmin drown
2016-06-12 15:13:18	Marty2000	Now, it will keep every place
2016-06-12 15:13:26	Marty2000	I'll try with a third place
2016-06-12 15:13:28	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-12 15:15:15	Marty2000	With a third place, the second one got erased (but not the first one)
2016-06-12 15:15:20	@Espyo	uh, odd
2016-06-12 15:15:24	Marty2000	That's our new mystery :p
2016-06-12 15:16:09	Yoshi2	I wonder if I am missing something or if dolphin removed the console thing from the newest dolphin version
2016-06-12 15:16:32	@Espyo	console thing?
2016-06-12 15:16:45	Yoshi2	the one that prints lots of weird stuff to your screen
2016-06-12 15:17:00	Yoshi2	not the log, the log is actually readable
2016-06-12 15:17:33	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-12 15:17:37	@Espyo	can't say that rings a bell
2016-06-12 15:19:15	Yoshi2	:^|
2016-06-12 15:20:29	UltraMario	|^:
2016-06-12 15:23:00	Yoshi2	Espyo: under one of the menus in the menu bar there is something along the lines of "Show log", "Log options" and "Show console"
2016-06-12 15:23:12	@Espyo	lemme see here
2016-06-12 15:23:17	@Espyo	Dolphin 4.0-9146
2016-06-12 15:23:24	Yoshi2	well, at least was
2016-06-12 15:23:51	@Espyo	can't really see those options here either
2016-06-12 15:24:17	Yoshi2	I got it in the old dolphin version on my desktop
2016-06-12 15:24:28	@Espyo	it had to have moved somewhere
2016-06-12 15:24:31	@Espyo	they wouldn't just delete it...
2016-06-12 15:24:48	@Espyo	but no, I can't really see it either
2016-06-12 15:24:51	@Espyo	there's one here for "reports"
2016-06-12 15:24:59	@Espyo	(in Portuguese)
2016-06-12 15:25:01	@Espyo	guessing it's for logging
2016-06-12 15:25:07	@Espyo	but nothing really about a console
2016-06-12 15:26:15	Yoshi2	it is completely unreadable so maybe they completely removed it, but I really wonder what the console was about
2016-06-12 15:28:19	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-12 15:28:24	@Espyo	guess that would be why
2016-06-12 15:28:30	@Espyo	well, at least you can use older versions of Dolphin still

2016-06-12 15:47:16	Marty2000	As you can see, fire geysers have health
2016-06-12 15:47:24	@Espyo	guess it makes sense

2016-06-12 15:47:44	Marty2000	and even though, fire still come out after the fire geyser's health has dropped to 0...
2016-06-12 15:47:53	Marty2000	the fire cannot harm Olimar or his Pikmin

2016-06-12 17:37:04	shadowmario42	Do you know when Pikmin 4 is coming out?
2016-06-12 17:37:16	@Espyo	nobody knows yet
2016-06-12 17:37:20	@Espyo	we may get some info this E3, though
2016-06-12 17:37:42	Marty2000	We do not have any information on it other than it is currently close to completion (according to his creator, Shigery Myamoto).
2016-06-12 17:37:44	shadowmario42	That would be nice.
2016-06-12 17:37:52	Marty2000	Indeed.
2016-06-12 17:38:33	shadowmario42	I hope it is on the WiiU.
2016-06-12 17:39:13	@Espyo	same
2016-06-12 17:40:11	Marty2000	Yeah, that would be better
2016-06-12 17:40:43	shadowmario42	If it IS on the NX, it would probably be a launch title.
2016-06-12 17:41:35	shadowmario42	Do you think so?
2016-06-12 17:41:59	UltraMario	i dont hope it's on the wii u
2016-06-12 17:41:59	UltraMario	tbh
2016-06-12 17:42:08	UltraMario	wii u is dying
2016-06-12 17:42:12	UltraMario	it wouldnt have the sales

2016-06-12 17:42:29	Marty2000	Well, the problem is that everybody doesn't have the means to buy immediately a console when it's out

2016-06-12 17:51:31	Marty2000	If you live in Europe, there's one currently (that will finish in 10 minutes)
2016-06-12 17:51:44	Marty2000	But I am not sure, it's just a supposition

2016-06-12 18:51:08	Marty2000	Espyo: https://youtu.be/G0xiroSvMvs I don't remember if I showed you those glitches
2016-06-12 18:51:15	Marty2000	Probably not
2016-06-12 18:58:13	@Espyo	ah, you never did
2016-06-12 18:58:29	Marty2000	Check description for more information
2016-06-12 18:58:56	Marty2000	I'm going to check the Splatfest's results too
2016-06-12 19:00:17	Marty2000	They're here
2016-06-12 19:00:51	@Espyo	it's still pretty confusing...
2016-06-12 19:01:01	@Espyo	lemme guess, Space won popularity, but definitely didn't win battles
2016-06-12 19:01:26	Marty2000	Do you really want to know? :p
2016-06-12 19:01:36	Marty2000	There's no surprise, really
2016-06-12 19:01:41	Marty2000	But you're partially right
2016-06-12 19:01:46	@Espyo	hm?
2016-06-12 19:01:53	@Espyo	yeah, let's hear it
2016-06-12 19:01:56	@Espyo	I'm playing something else
2016-06-12 19:02:03	@Espyo	so I'm not going to boot Splatoon just for the results
2016-06-12 19:02:11	Marty2000	Sure
2016-06-12 19:02:32	Marty2000	I'll tell you in details, I've recorded it becaue I also wanted to see Callie or Marie's comments
2016-06-12 19:02:36	Marty2000	Please wait...
2016-06-12 19:02:41	@Espyo	hm, ok
2016-06-12 19:04:15	Marty2000	Sorry for being long!

2016-06-12 19:04:43	Marty2000	363-337 for World
2016-06-12 19:07:22	@Espyo	I call bull
2016-06-12 19:09:18	@Espyo	these have to be manipulated
2016-06-12 19:09:48	Marty2000	Heh
2016-06-12 19:18:02	Marty2000	I feel like the SPlash-o-Matic is the best weapon for covering turf
2016-06-12 19:18:07	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/23/1465755462-points.jpg
2016-06-12 19:18:39	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-12 19:18:44	@Espyo	but the best is easily the Inkbrush
2016-06-12 19:18:46	@Espyo	hang on a sec
2016-06-12 19:19:31	Marty2000	Yeah, probably
2016-06-12 19:23:05	Testyo	you need either good
2016-06-12 19:24:26	@Espyo	http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Main_Weapon#Stats
2016-06-12 19:24:38	@Espyo	Range Blaster is the worst at inking
2016-06-12 19:24:42	@Espyo	Inkbrush is the best
2016-06-12 19:25:26	Marty2000	I'm trying to get over 2000 in Turf War :p
2016-06-12 19:25:56	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-12 19:35:38	Marty2000	I can easily get more than 1500p with the abilities I use
2016-06-12 19:35:52	Marty2000	I'll take a screenshot after my current match, but that's fun, he he
2016-06-12 19:42:23	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/23/1465756862-wiiu-screenshot-gamepad-0176a.jpg
2016-06-12 19:42:39	Marty2000	This is what I use with the Splash-o-Matic
2016-06-12 19:42:47	@Espyo	wait
2016-06-12 19:42:52	@Espyo	how do you have less Splatfest Power than me
2016-06-12 19:42:56	@Espyo	and are S+ 99 rank?
2016-06-12 19:43:01	@Espyo	and I'm a lowly S 30?
2016-06-12 19:43:21	Marty2000	I was S+99 a long time ago... and I haven't played for so long
2016-06-12 19:43:21	@Espyo	woah, that equipment, though
2016-06-12 19:43:25	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-12 19:43:25	Marty2000	So my level decreased
2016-06-12 19:43:30	@Espyo	so this screenshot isn't updated?
2016-06-12 19:43:47	Marty2000	No, this is a screenshot iv'e just taken, but I haven't played Ranked on that account
2016-06-12 19:43:53	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-12 19:43:54	Marty2000	I've*
2016-06-12 19:44:16	Marty2000	I mean, I'm no longer playing Ranked on that account unless it's a squad
2016-06-12 19:44:21	Marty2000	Are you S?
2016-06-12 19:44:27	@Espyo	yeah, reached it a week ago
2016-06-12 19:44:30	@Espyo	not touching it again :V
2016-06-12 19:44:36	Marty2000	He he, congrats
2016-06-12 19:44:40	@Espyo	thanks
2016-06-12 19:44:42	Marty2000	Yu can freely in money in squads now

2016-06-12 19:44:51	Marty2000	You
2016-06-12 19:44:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-12 19:46:04	Marty2000	I have some equipment that I never use but is probably interesting...
2016-06-12 19:46:25	Marty2000	Your equipement has a majority of Quick Respawn abilities, am I right?
2016-06-12 19:51:21	@Espyo	yeah

2016-06-12 19:54:17	Yoshi2	such a boring day today, raaarghh
2016-06-12 19:54:32	Marty2000	Indeed, he he
2016-06-12 19:54:45	Yoshi2	the BW discord is empty and on pikipedia you are only talking about splatoon :v
2016-06-12 19:55:00	Marty2000	We are open to any other discussion
2016-06-12 19:55:14	Marty2000	I'm trying to either bring life to the chat, or make everyody bored of Splatoon
2016-06-12 19:55:15	Marty2000	;)
2016-06-12 20:12:59	Yoshi2	the lua scripting in BW is more limited than I expected
2016-06-12 20:13:08	Yoshi2	couldn't use some library functions
2016-06-12 20:14:44	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-12 20:16:19	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-12 20:16:26	@Espyo	kinda makes me thinking they WANTED modding to be possible
2016-06-12 20:16:43	@Espyo	or maybe Nintendo protocols stop games from having a scripting language that accesses too many system calls

2016-06-12 20:18:10	@Espyo	hm
2016-06-12 20:18:11	@Espyo	I guess
2016-06-12 20:20:51	Yoshi2	you might think they wanted modding to be possible
2016-06-12 20:21:53	Yoshi2	but this is kuju, they are not 2nd party, nintendo contracted them to do a BW game
2016-06-12 20:22:16	@Espyo	ah
2016-06-12 20:22:26	Yoshi2	and Lua scripting and xml files seem to result from wanting to lower development costs/increase development speed
2016-06-12 20:23:03	@Espyo	it's just that Lua is so well-known for its use as a "modding" language
2016-06-12 20:23:10	Yoshi2	at the cost of performance/engine complexity (the game is fairly simple)

2016-06-12 22:06:37	Marty2000	Well then, I'll join. Feel free to tell me if I shouldn't :p If I remember, Gaming98 uses the Splash-o-Matic as well. He's really great with it, I'm going to take the same weapon for once

2016-06-12 22:07:35	Marty2000	I guess
2016-06-12 22:07:58	Marty2000	Since he also uses the Sploosh-o-Matic, no doubt he likes the new one as well

2016-06-12 23:48:20	@PikFan	we were on fire
2016-06-12 23:48:38	G98	I liked the part where Espyo died to a stray Inkzooza shot

2016-06-13 00:43:42	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-13 00:45:09	Scruffy	I saw Cheepy-Cheepy commented on the Burrowing Snagret page's format
2016-06-13 00:45:34	Scruffy	more in favor of separating the info into articles per game
2016-06-13 00:46:04	@PikFan	hmm, I see that
2016-06-13 00:46:21	Scruffy	But that's alright, after all it was just a test
2016-06-13 00:46:42	@PikFan	I have to agree with him on the collapsible part
2016-06-13 00:46:54	@PikFan	we don't need to collapse every single distinct subsection
2016-06-13 00:47:02	@PikFan	just collapse the whole section
2016-06-13 00:47:12	@PikFan	and when it opens up, the subsections are already there

2016-06-13 01:01:20	@PikFan	it's not working

2016-06-13 01:01:55	Scruffy	Editing on Fanon?
2016-06-13 01:02:13	@PikFan	I'm trying to merge the different collapsible sections together
2016-06-13 01:02:16	@PikFan	and it's not working
2016-06-13 01:02:21	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2016-06-13 01:02:29	Scruffy	The game header templates cannot be hidden
2016-06-13 01:02:34	Scruffy	collapsed*
2016-06-13 01:02:40	@PikFan	no, I'm not worried about those
2016-06-13 01:03:18	@PikFan	I'm trying to distinguish between different sections
2016-06-13 01:03:25	@PikFan	and it's not working
2016-06-13 01:04:10	Scruffy	Maybe I can help if you pastebin how the page looks now?
2016-06-13 01:04:28	Scruffy	Or, wait, I can just go in edit mode too
2016-06-13 01:04:45	@PikFan	wait, I got it to work
2016-06-13 01:04:53	Scruffy	Ah ok
2016-06-13 01:04:54	@PikFan	alright, so
2016-06-13 01:05:05	@PikFan	I was trying to add bold text to indicate sections
2016-06-13 01:05:17	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-13 01:05:26	@PikFan	and for some reason, it was forcing the spoiler section to stay open
2016-06-13 01:05:35	@PikFan	but then I added spaces, and it works
2016-06-13 01:05:46	Scruffy	Ah
2016-06-13 01:05:49	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-06-13 01:07:49	@PikFan	wait, never mind
2016-06-13 01:08:00	@PikFan	now I figured out how to use ACTUAL SUBSECTIONS
2016-06-13 01:08:03	@PikFan	yessssss
2016-06-13 01:08:07	Scruffy	woah!
2016-06-13 01:08:09	@PikFan	<br> saves the day
2016-06-13 01:09:02	Scruffy	If subsections are hidden, do they work in the table of contents/
2016-06-13 01:09:03	Scruffy	?
2016-06-13 01:10:17	@PikFan	yep
2016-06-13 01:10:23	Scruffy	Awesome!
2016-06-13 01:10:41	@PikFan	well, what do you mean, "work"
2016-06-13 01:10:42	@PikFan	?
2016-06-13 01:10:45	@PikFan	they appear, yeah
2016-06-13 01:10:58	Scruffy	Right, but if you click on them in the ToC, does anything happen?
2016-06-13 01:11:01	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-13 01:11:06	@PikFan	nope
2016-06-13 01:11:17	@PikFan	only if the spoiler section is open
2016-06-13 01:11:17	Scruffy	When I tested it with {{switchable}} on Pikipedia, nothing happened
2016-06-13 01:11:19	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-13 01:11:26	Scruffy	The page can't find hidden text
2016-06-13 01:13:02	Scruffy	I guess that's ok if we hide the table of contents
2016-06-13 01:13:21	Scruffy	but that won't be so great if we have a page with a lot of games
2016-06-13 01:13:36	@PikFan	maybe we could make it default to being open
2016-06-13 01:13:45	@PikFan	then users can hide each section as they go along
2016-06-13 01:14:25	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-13 01:14:38	Scruffy	And then if they're just there to read everything it won't be a pain
2016-06-13 01:14:49	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-13 01:14:53	Scruffy	that's a great idea
2016-06-13 01:15:26	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-13 01:15:42	@PikFan	so you CAN hide game header templates

2016-06-13 20:25:42	@Espyo	oh, Marty?
2016-06-13 20:25:44	@Espyo	one thing
2016-06-13 20:25:52	@Espyo	when you're uploading an image on top of an existing one
2016-06-13 20:26:07	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-06-13 20:26:12	@Espyo	you're meant to simply describe what changes you made to the image, to get the new one
2016-06-13 20:26:22	@Espyo	you shouldn't write down {{file info}} or anything like that
2016-06-13 20:26:22	Testyo	"file_info" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:file_info
2016-06-13 20:26:35	@Espyo	simply stuff like "This one is better quality.", "Removed border.", etc.
2016-06-13 20:26:57	Marty2000	Hmm... I didn't write {{file info}} for the images I replaced
2016-06-13 20:26:57	Testyo	"file_info" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:file_info

2016-06-13 20:27:24	@Espyo	you did here
2016-06-13 20:27:29	Marty2000	I'm sorry if it's the case, I wasn't paying attention then. I usually just put "better quality" or "shows the location better"
2016-06-13 20:27:41	@Espyo	the original upload you made, you didn't have the game and area (somehow?)
2016-06-13 20:27:41	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-06-13 20:27:51	@Espyo	and on the newer version you uploaded on top, you wrote down {{file info}} stuff

2016-06-13 20:27:56	@Espyo	but because that's just a comment, it had no effect
2016-06-13 20:28:02	@Espyo	I later fixed it, though
2016-06-13 20:28:23	Marty2000	I wonder if it wasn't a bug from my computer (look, they were uploaded at the same time)
2016-06-13 20:28:25	Marty2000	I see, thanks
2016-06-13 20:28:31	@Espyo	ah, maybe
2016-06-13 20:28:33	@Espyo	weird stuff...
2016-06-13 20:29:10	Marty2000	Well, if it wasn't a bug, I'll try to remember, thanks ;)
2016-06-13 20:29:33	@Espyo	all right, thanks

2016-06-13 20:37:24	@PikFan	yesterday in my plaza, I saw something very upsetting
2016-06-13 20:37:46	Marty2000	Espyo and I lost that Splatfest, it was quite... expected, I'd say :p
2016-06-13 20:37:49	Marty2000	Ah?
2016-06-13 20:37:52	@PikFan	it said "jesus stop with the pray for orlando stuff death isn't that big of a deal"
2016-06-13 20:38:00	Marty2000	Right now, the only thing I see is your Inkling
2016-06-13 20:38:02	@PikFan	how in the hell can anyone say that?!
2016-06-13 20:38:13	@Espyo	wow

2016-06-13 20:38:33	@PikFan	yeah, but I've NEVER seen a post like that
2016-06-13 20:38:38	@PikFan	*do they not
2016-06-13 20:38:47	@PikFan	I hope it got removed
2016-06-13 20:39:03	@PikFan	but I took a screenshot and posted to Miiverse about it
2016-06-13 20:39:12	@PikFan	...surprisingly, the mods haven't deleted my post yet
2016-06-13 20:39:26	@PikFan	maybe it's because I acknowledged that it's not Splatoon related, heh :P
2016-06-13 20:40:17	@Espyo	they take a while to notice and delete posts

2016-06-14 18:57:14	@Espyo	I don't care much for Pokémon, so I'm just ignoring it for now
2016-06-14 18:57:21	@Espyo	I'll catch up to the Zelda trailer in a bit though
2016-06-14 18:57:30	@J	[18:39:33] @J the music is glorious

2016-06-14 19:00:45	@Espyo	(twitch is heavier than dark matter)
2016-06-14 19:00:50	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-06-14 19:01:01	Yoshi2	I use livestreamer so it doesn't matter too much :^)
2016-06-14 19:01:09	Marty2000	Hello Espyo, Testyo, Yoshi2
2016-06-14 19:01:09	Testyo	that's why I'm saying this is all up to chance
2016-06-14 19:01:33	Marty2000	Yoshi2: I'll try to take a look, thank you.
2016-06-14 19:01:53	Marty2000	Maybe this will help me like Zelda, he he
2016-06-14 19:01:59	@Espyo	wow, this doesn't feel like Zelda at all
2016-06-14 19:02:00	@Espyo	hi Marty
2016-06-14 19:04:46	Marty2000	Would anybody please give me a link to the Nintendo Tree House?
2016-06-14 19:06:36	Marty2000	Please, don't bother. I have it :)

2016-06-14 19:09:45	Marty2000	No, just as I post the image, it begins :p
2016-06-14 19:17:31	@Espyo	https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13457637_1112912242111338_1060368284_n.jpg?oh=66297cb616b3f1f2695d3e58abfe9d70&oe=57633C65 oh, a Sheargrub
2016-06-14 19:19:39	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-06-14 19:23:56	Marty2000	I have to admit I've gained some interest in the game, it looks fun
2016-06-14 19:25:39	Yoshi2	seems pretty cool
2016-06-14 19:34:06	@Espyo	I really, REALLY hope they don't make stupid design decisions
2016-06-14 19:34:08	Marty2000	Looks like it's just ended: it looked cool, I'm looking forward to getting more information on it
2016-06-14 19:34:16	@Espyo	the gameplay seems really far from classic Zelda, but that's not a bad thing
2016-06-14 19:34:36	Marty2000	Espyo: I see. I can understand why it could bother fans of the series
2016-06-14 19:34:36	@Espyo	I'm just worried they'll do something stupid like force you to go through a long, unskippable explanation of every item you collect, EVERY TIME YOU COLLECT IT
2016-06-14 19:34:41	@Espyo	like Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword did...
2016-06-14 19:34:52	@Espyo	yeah, could easily bother people
2016-06-14 19:34:59	@Espyo	I'm a fan of the series, and it's not bothering me much, though
2016-06-14 19:35:05	@Espyo	I have to admit, I think I'd like a "classic" Zelda more
2016-06-14 19:35:08	@Espyo	but this seems fun too
2016-06-14 19:35:21	@Espyo	so if at the end of the day, it still has lore like Zelda, dungeons like Zelda, items like Zelda, and charm like Zelda...
2016-06-14 19:35:24	@Espyo	then I don't really care about how it's played
2016-06-14 19:35:43	Marty2000	On the other hand, it's cool for people new to the series or for those who didn't like much the other games
2016-06-14 19:35:45	Marty2000	i see
2016-06-14 19:35:46	Marty2000	I see*
2016-06-14 19:36:03	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-14 19:36:15	@Espyo	oh, I also really, REALLY hope the dungeons are actually creative and challenging
2016-06-14 19:36:22	@Espyo	all Zelda games have great dungeons
2016-06-14 19:36:27	@Espyo	(some of the older games get a bit rough, though)
2016-06-14 19:36:28	@Espyo	but Skyward Sword?
2016-06-14 19:36:45	@Espyo	as much as I adore Skyward Sword, its dungeons were mostly just a matter of going from room A to B to C, and fight the boss
2016-06-14 19:36:51	@Espyo	no puzzle involved, no exploration involved, no nothing
2016-06-14 19:36:52	@Espyo	ugh
2016-06-14 19:37:05	@Espyo	it's tough to find games with puzzling dungeons that pull it off well
2016-06-14 19:37:10	@Espyo	so playing Zelda is great for me because of it
2016-06-14 19:37:17	Marty2000	It seemed the dungeons where quite short, didn't it?
2016-06-14 19:37:25	@Espyo	oh, these?
2016-06-14 19:37:29	Marty2000	I don't know the series well, so I could be wrong
2016-06-14 19:37:33	@Espyo	yeah, me and some others are thinking these aren't really dungeons at all
2016-06-14 19:37:39	@Espyo	more like small shrines or something
2016-06-14 19:37:45	@Espyo	or they could just be small for the sake of E3 demonstrations
2016-06-14 19:37:48	@Espyo	they didn't even have bosses
2016-06-14 19:37:50	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-14 19:37:53	@Espyo	so I'm betting they're small here on purpose
2016-06-14 19:37:54	Marty2000	Yes.
2016-06-14 19:37:58	@Espyo	but they'll change on release
2016-06-14 19:38:00	@Espyo	...I hope
2016-06-14 19:38:08	@Espyo	<Deku> yeah they just confirmed shrines and dungeons are different
2016-06-14 19:38:10	@Espyo	a friend JUST said that
2016-06-14 19:38:13	@Espyo	well, there you have it :V
2016-06-14 19:41:59	Marty2000	Mario Party: Star Rush on 3DS
2016-06-14 19:42:13	Marty2000	I'd love to have Pikmin 4, but it seems unlikely to have information on it... :/
2016-06-14 19:42:57	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-06-14 19:43:10	@Espyo	on one hand, I always sigh of relief whenever we don't get Pikmin 4 news
2016-06-14 19:43:16	@Espyo	gives us more time to organize Pikipedia and such
2016-06-14 19:43:20	@Espyo	because the second it becomes active
2016-06-14 19:43:26	@Espyo	we'll have to make with what we have do
2016-06-14 19:43:33	@Espyo	and if that's not good enough to fight the wikia...
2016-06-14 19:43:42	@Espyo	but on the other hand... I want Pikmin!
2016-06-14 19:43:43	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2Bla
2016-06-14 19:43:48	--	Yoshi2Bla is now known as Yoshi2
2016-06-14 19:45:28	Marty2000	I'll be here, tomorrow. This is the day where (when?) Pikmin 4 could be announced, since I read they would talk about upcoming 3DS and Wii U games. I'm afraid of messing the wiki in case there would information, though, but I could still share everything here. Let's hope :p
2016-06-14 19:46:48	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-14 19:46:54	@Espyo	oh, I did add a guide

2016-06-14 19:47:18	Marty2000	Yes, I saw it
2016-06-14 19:47:23	Marty2000	It's really great
2016-06-14 19:48:13	Marty2000	I don't know if I'd be up to such a task, though. :p I mean, I know how to add info, but as I said, it could be a terrible mess...
2016-06-14 19:48:58	@Espyo	it could
2016-06-14 19:49:03	@Espyo	but as long as you follow that, it should be fine
2016-06-14 19:49:11	@Espyo	I'll try to keep my eyes sharpened for news
2016-06-14 19:57:39	Marty2000	Sorry, I'm back. I see
2016-06-14 20:21:41	@Espyo	!!
2016-06-14 20:21:45	@Espyo	more unused enemies in Pikmin 3!

2016-06-14 20:25:05	@Espyo	he also has this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7h48EvElGk
2016-06-14 20:25:10	Marty2000	Yep, they really are. But it's cool to see them in-game
2016-06-14 20:25:12	@Espyo	...I never really noticed that it's a beach
2016-06-14 20:25:14	@Espyo	a proper beach
2016-06-14 20:25:26	Marty2000	Ah
2016-06-14 20:25:48	@Espyo	he's got some more P3 videos
2016-06-14 20:28:04	Marty2000	Yes, he slo has a twitch https://www.twitch.tv/bielr3  where he streams speedruns from time to time

2016-06-14 20:45:52	@Espyo	yeeeeee
2016-06-14 20:45:59	@Espyo	it's pretty different from classic Zeldas
2016-06-14 20:46:02	@Espyo	but man, am I loving it
2016-06-14 20:46:06	@PikFan	I knowwwwwww
2016-06-14 20:46:21	@PikFan	heck, I created a quick breakdown of the trailer and printed it out and gave it to my friends
2016-06-14 20:46:24	@Espyo	I actually want to stop watching it so that the experience doesn't get spoiled
2016-06-14 20:47:03	@PikFan	isn't it meant to be watched though? :P
2016-06-14 20:47:24	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-14 20:47:27	@Espyo	doesn't mean I will
2016-06-14 20:47:34	@Espyo	sidewalks are meant to be walked on
2016-06-14 20:47:38	@Espyo	but I need to take the bus :|

2016-06-14 20:48:02	@PikFan	well, I am too, but that's because I'm at school
2016-06-14 20:48:05	@Espyo	I'm just saying I don't want to
2016-06-14 20:48:12	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-06-14 20:48:14	@Espyo	but it'll be better when I DO play it
2016-06-14 20:48:20	@Espyo	people always think spoilers are just plot things
2016-06-14 20:48:22	@Espyo	I don't feel the same
2016-06-14 20:48:29	@Espyo	for me, a spoiler is anything that spoils the experience
2016-06-14 20:48:35	@PikFan	let me guess: nothing Pikmin-related?
2016-06-14 20:48:39	@Espyo	knowing the controls, for crying out loud, could count as this
2016-06-14 20:48:42	Marty2000	Nothing for now
2016-06-14 20:48:55	@Espyo	the experience of diving in and trying to fumble with the controls as your character hopelessly fights like an inexperienced fighter
2016-06-14 20:49:03	@Espyo	is much different from diving in and performing combos on the first enemy you face
2016-06-14 20:49:10	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-14 20:49:12	Marty2000	Espyo: yeah, you can be excited even if you know the entire story of the game if you see little gameplay
2016-06-14 20:49:16	@Espyo	of course... I'll have to open an exception for Pikmin 4
2016-06-14 20:49:22	@Espyo	I'll absorb anything I see and document it asap
2016-06-14 20:49:28	@Espyo	yeah, definitely

2016-06-14 20:50:07	Yoshi2	Espyo: word
2016-06-14 20:50:16	Yoshi2	I stopped watching it after a bit for those reasons
2016-06-14 20:50:17	Marty2000	I remember, I watched tons of videos before Pikmin 3 came out, and I knew everything before buying the game :/ But I didn't care, it was cool :p
2016-06-14 20:50:21	@Espyo	yep
2016-06-14 20:50:26	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-06-14 20:50:36	@Espyo	I also learned a fair bit about Melee before playing it
2016-06-14 20:50:43	Marty2000	I don't know if it was the same for you guys
2016-06-14 20:50:44	@Espyo	in fact, my first experience with it was in Dolphin
2016-06-14 20:50:49	@Espyo	the first thing I did was a wavedash :V
2016-06-14 20:51:02	@Espyo	I think I mostly ignored Pikmin 3
2016-06-14 20:51:08	@Espyo	I knew we couldn't compete with wikia's Pikmin 3 knowledge
2016-06-14 20:51:24	@Espyo	so I just decided to focus on P1 and P2
2016-06-14 20:51:24	@PikFan	it's looking more and more like Xenoblade Chronicles X
2016-06-14 20:51:34	@PikFan	just Zelda-y
2016-06-14 20:53:34	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-14 20:53:38	@Espyo	I'm getting a vibe from a lot of games
2016-06-14 20:53:44	@Espyo	Minecraft, Skyrim, Xenoblade...

2016-06-14 20:54:03	@Espyo	if it's like this, but still has the Zelda essentials at heart, I think it'll be a bomb
2016-06-14 20:54:06	@Espyo	oh, and if it is well made
2016-06-14 20:54:09	@PikFan	isn't Zelda what inspired all those games?
2016-06-14 20:54:12	@Espyo	these parts seem well made, but they coul butcher it at any time
2016-06-14 20:54:13	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-06-14 20:54:16	@Espyo	and knowing Nintendo...

2016-06-14 20:54:37	@PikFan	heh, true
2016-06-14 20:54:42	@Espyo	temperature system?
2016-06-14 20:54:46	@Espyo	ok, I have to stop watching
2016-06-14 20:54:47	@PikFan	but yeah, it's just coming back around full circle

2016-06-14 20:55:15	@Espyo	and starting to shiver
2016-06-14 20:55:20	@Espyo	and they said it affects gameplay
2016-06-14 20:55:37	@PikFan	wow
2016-06-14 20:55:45	@PikFan	I bet Zelda Wiki is busy
2016-06-14 20:56:02	Scruffy	I only watched the one 3 minute trailer
2016-06-14 20:56:19	@PikFan	how did you feel about it?
2016-06-14 20:56:23	@Espyo	unfortunately, probably not as busy as Zelda wikiA...
2016-06-14 20:56:25	Scruffy	I feel the less I know about it before I play it the better
2016-06-14 20:56:28	@Espyo	sigh... let's just hope the same doesn't happen to us
2016-06-14 20:56:29	Scruffy	But it did amaze me
2016-06-14 20:56:30	@Espyo	I mean, it won't
2016-06-14 20:56:41	@Espyo	so it looks like we're all on the same boat here, then
2016-06-14 20:56:47	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-14 20:56:48	@Espyo	the less we know, the more we'll enjoy it when we do play it
2016-06-14 20:56:56	@Espyo	it's this really hard internal struggle
2016-06-14 20:57:01	@Espyo	I WANT to learn more about this game
2016-06-14 20:57:03	@Espyo	but I want to savour it!
2016-06-14 20:57:07	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-06-14 20:57:11	@PikFan	I do too
2016-06-14 20:57:26	@PikFan	my rule is that I can look at content BEFORE the game is released
2016-06-14 20:57:29	@PikFan	after that, nothing
2016-06-14 20:57:50	@Espyo	well, yeah
2016-06-14 20:57:56	@PikFan	oh, how do you all feel about the possibility of voice acting?
2016-06-14 20:57:56	@Espyo	because in general, pre-release stuff doesn't spoil much
2016-06-14 20:57:58	Scruffy	My rule is to watch one video with gameplay in it, and then nothing
2016-06-14 20:58:07	@Espyo	whereas post-release stuff is like youtube videos on easter eggs on the final boss
2016-06-14 20:58:14	@Espyo	no voice acting so far
2016-06-14 20:58:22	Scruffy	There was that one "Wake up Link"
2016-06-14 20:58:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-14 20:58:27	Scruffy	Or, two
2016-06-14 20:58:31	@Espyo	but besides that... nothing
2016-06-14 20:58:37	@Espyo	dunno what to think of it
2016-06-14 20:58:41	@Espyo	I prefer it to stay without voice actors
2016-06-14 20:58:51	@Espyo	to have good voice acting, the game has to have GOOD voice acting
2016-06-14 20:58:55	@PikFan	I think it could work
2016-06-14 20:58:58	@PikFan	but they have to do it right
2016-06-14 20:59:03	@Espyo	bad voices, repetitive clips, or lines that don't fit are a LOT worse than just silence
2016-06-14 20:59:09	@PikFan	anyway, I gotta go to class
2016-06-14 20:59:11	@PikFan	byhe
2016-06-14 20:59:13	@PikFan	*bye

2016-06-14 21:01:06	Scruffy	WOOAH
2016-06-14 21:01:27	@Espyo	oh, Scruffy, did you ever see the OTHER unused enemies in action?
2016-06-14 21:01:54	Scruffy	Yes
2016-06-14 21:02:13	Scruffy	But it's neat to see Pikmin 2-graphic enemies in the shaders of Pikmin 3

2016-06-14 21:02:51	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-14 21:02:53	@Espyo	it looks... not bad
2016-06-14 21:02:56	Scruffy	Yeah heh
2016-06-14 21:03:02	@Espyo	after seeing the Pikmin 3 enemy textures and maps
2016-06-14 21:03:10	@Espyo	and seeing how the tiny P2 textures are just slapped in the unused enemies
2016-06-14 21:03:15	@Espyo	I expected a horrible monstrosity
2016-06-14 21:03:19	@Espyo	but they kinda fit...
2016-06-14 21:03:23	@Espyo	the Honeywisp shocked me the most
2016-06-14 21:03:42	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-14 21:04:36	Scruffy	It cast soft shadows on the egg and everything
2016-06-14 21:04:45	Scruffy	Man, that "Buriko" enemy is pretty dangerous
2016-06-14 21:05:04	Marty2000	Yes, that would have probably been a very annoying enemy, heh
2016-06-14 21:06:24	@Espyo	dangerous... if it actually caught Pikmin
2016-06-14 21:06:27	@Espyo	it's too fast for its own good
2016-06-14 21:06:32	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-14 21:11:31	Scruffy	Oh, I learn something every time I play Pikmin
2016-06-14 21:12:12	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-06-14 21:12:41	Scruffy	In Pikmin 3, if you press the arrows on the Gamepad that show you a transition from one room to another, it will jump to the other arrow so you know where that path leads
2016-06-14 21:13:01	Marty2000	Ah, yes
2016-06-14 21:13:14	Marty2000	That's useful for knowing a path
2016-06-14 21:18:28	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-06-14 21:35:25	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2016-06-14 21:45:39	Scruffy	I've been touching up the same Bowser model I've had in Blender
2016-06-14 21:46:05	Scruffy	It's gotten to this point where he looks good in any lighting, in some he looks particularly realistic
2016-06-14 21:46:09	Scruffy	I'm really happy about it
2016-06-14 21:46:18	Scruffy	But I don't know what to do with it
2016-06-14 21:47:03	@Espyo	hah
2016-06-14 21:47:19	@Espyo	yeah...sometimes you just want to add detail to something, even though you're not going to do anything with it
2016-06-14 21:47:29	@Espyo	although, sometimes, because it's so good, you eventually find somewhere to put it on
2016-06-14 21:47:37	@Espyo	and if you don't
2016-06-14 21:47:41	@Espyo	heck, at least you made something great
2016-06-14 21:47:46	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-14 21:47:54	Scruffy	It makes for great wallpapers, anyway
2016-06-14 21:48:05	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-06-14 22:01:30	Scruffy	Gotta go, see ya!

2016-06-14 23:27:41	@Espyo	well, on Mibbit, I think there's a button for color below the part where you type the text
2016-06-14 23:27:43	@Espyo	or is it above?
2016-06-14 23:27:48	@Espyo	but for me, I just run a script that colors automatically

2016-06-14 23:31:06	@Espyo	for the P2 electricity that kills, I'll call it electrocution
2016-06-14 23:31:13	@Espyo	but I'm not quite sure what to call the stunning P3 one
2016-06-14 23:31:14	@Espyo	paralysis?
2016-06-14 23:31:17	PikPikMaster100	What engine?

2016-06-14 23:35:43	PikPikMaster100	I just had an idea by looking at the changelog
2016-06-14 23:35:49	@Espyo	oh?
2016-06-14 23:36:32	PikPikMaster100	If you need to make the gates bigger for 20 pellets, why just shrink the 20 pellets XD
2016-06-14 23:37:09	@Espyo	I'm trying to keep the proportions the same as in the canon games
2016-06-14 23:37:14	@Espyo	 20 pellets are already kinda small
2016-06-14 23:37:20	@Espyo	if I make them smaller, they'll be like 10 pellets :|
2016-06-14 23:37:29	@Espyo	plus, that gate problem's already fixed, so no worries there
2016-06-14 23:37:49	PikPikMaster100	Oh... so the gates were midgets :D
2016-06-14 23:38:03	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-14 23:38:06	@Espyo	not any more, though!
2016-06-14 23:39:18	PikPikMaster100	Dirt walls= 1/2 White Bone Walls= 1/2 Black Bone Walls is one of my ideas
2016-06-14 23:40:01	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-14 23:40:58	PikPikMaster100	And then all other walls= 1/4 Black bone walls
2016-06-14 23:42:49	PikPikMaster100	I could work on a scratch remake if you want
2016-06-14 23:43:28	@Espyo	how so?
2016-06-14 23:44:15	PikPikMaster100	I have an account on Scratch, and it is a coding website, and i could try chunk by chunk
2016-06-14 23:44:44	@Espyo	if you want

2016-06-15 00:18:01	Marty2000	Goodbye PikPikMaster100 (he won't see it either :/ )
2016-06-15 00:18:06	@PikFan	hi
2016-06-15 00:18:17	Marty2000	Hello :)
2016-06-15 00:27:49	<--	Chiaki_Nanami (Pi@59-995-323-88-lr28.tbcn.telia.com) has quit (Quit: Good night.)
2016-06-15 00:31:09	Marty2000	So, tomorrow, upcoming Wii U and 3DS games will be shown (Paper Mario: Color Splash, for example). I really hope we'll have at least some information on Pikmin 4. Otherwise...
2016-06-15 00:31:24	@PikFan	otherwise what?
2016-06-15 00:31:37	Marty2000	I'll... cry :/
2016-06-15 00:31:56	@PikFan	well, might wanna cry now
2016-06-15 00:32:01	@PikFan	cause they're not gonna show it
2016-06-15 00:32:05	Marty2000	No, seriously, this'd be great
2016-06-15 00:32:09	Marty2000	Yeah, probably
2016-06-15 00:32:12	@PikFan	I say so because it's Nintendo
2016-06-15 00:32:17	@PikFan	and you know how Nintendo is
2016-06-15 00:32:20	Marty2000	Sure :p
2016-06-15 00:32:22	@PikFan	we ALL know how they are
2016-06-15 00:32:47	@PikFan	if they do show Pikmin 4, that'd be awesome
2016-06-15 00:33:04	@PikFan	but the off chance of that happening is so tiny
2016-06-15 00:33:28	Marty2000	And I have the feeling the game might be released on mobile phone...
2016-06-15 00:33:35	@PikFan	heh, why?
2016-06-15 00:33:43	Marty2000	But it's just a supposition (that I don't want to be true)
2016-06-15 00:33:59	Marty2000	Because Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem are already coming on mobile phones
2016-06-15 00:34:07	@PikFan	...they are?
2016-06-15 00:34:13	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-15 00:34:16	@PikFan	was that announced today?
2016-06-15 00:34:24	Marty2000	Hmm, I think they announced that some weeks or months ago
2016-06-15 00:34:31	Marty2000	I'd search a link for you
2016-06-15 00:34:33	Marty2000	Please wait
2016-06-15 00:34:40	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2016-06-15 00:34:57	@PikFan	I search Nintendo news often, so it's weird I didn't hear about that
2016-06-15 00:35:12	Marty2000	https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/27/nintendo-animal-crossing-fire-emblem-apps/
2016-06-15 00:35:15	Marty2000	http://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-and-fire-emblem-are-getting-mobile-apps-1773316255
2016-06-15 00:35:16	@PikFan	anyway, Pikmin on mobile COULD work, since we have stylus mode
2016-06-15 00:35:33	@PikFan	so they'd just have to tweak that a bit to get it to work
2016-06-15 00:35:45	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-15 00:36:51	Marty2000	But to be honest, even though the game could be cool on mobile phones, I prefer to have it on another console: I am quite ill-at-ease when playing on mobile phones (but that's just me).
2016-06-15 00:36:58	@PikFan	I agree
2016-06-15 00:37:16	@PikFan	I haven't used stylus mode much, because I couldn't get used to it
2016-06-15 00:37:27	@PikFan	and also, I don't have a smartphone anyway
2016-06-15 00:40:18	Marty2000	Anyway, I'll be here tomorrow, so if Pikmin 4 were to be announced, I'll let you all know as soon as you'd connect. I can't wait...
2016-06-15 00:40:28	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-15 00:40:33	Marty2000	When does the Treehouse starts tomorrow?
2016-06-15 00:40:38	@PikFan	well, don't get your hopes up ;)
2016-06-15 00:40:41	@PikFan	not sure
2016-06-15 00:40:46	Marty2000	Yeah, sure
2016-06-15 00:41:10	Marty2000	Eh, that was strange. I'll check
2016-06-15 00:41:46	Marty2000	Tell me what time it is currently where you live (so that I can tell you)
2016-06-15 00:43:24	Marty2000	For me, it starts around 7 p.m
2016-06-15 00:43:34	Marty2000	(currently 1:43 am where I live).
2016-06-15 00:43:46	@PikFan	4:43 pm
2016-06-15 00:44:00	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-15 00:44:08	@PikFan	so what, you're... 9 hours ahead?
2016-06-15 00:44:20	Marty2000	So, it will start at 10 a.m for you
2016-06-15 00:44:21	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-15 00:44:25	@PikFan	oh, so it starts at 10 am— yeah
2016-06-15 00:44:41	@PikFan	well, that's convenient, since school starts later tomorrow :P
2016-06-15 00:44:47	Marty2000	Hah
2016-06-15 00:45:02	Marty2000	Well then, we'll see... but don't get your hopes up, PikFan ;)
2016-06-15 00:45:10	@PikFan	you too
2016-06-15 00:45:20	Marty2000	Yes, I know, he he
2016-06-15 00:45:24	@PikFan	lol
2016-06-15 00:46:48	Marty2000	Ah, now that I think of it
2016-06-15 00:46:53	Marty2000	Espyo had to show you something
2016-06-15 00:47:00	Marty2000	And posted a video for you the moment you left
2016-06-15 00:47:01	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-15 00:47:05	@PikFan	oh?
2016-06-15 00:47:08	Marty2000	Wait, I'll find the link for you
2016-06-15 00:47:11	Marty2000	It's "amazing"

2016-06-15 00:48:13	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8ZV4AzGglg Lol, same as in Pikmin 2
2016-06-15 00:49:32	@PikFan	the Emperor Bulblax is pretty out of place
2016-06-15 00:50:19	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-15 00:50:30	Marty2000	They're clearly unfinished
2016-06-15 00:50:36	Marty2000	But still cool to see them
2016-06-15 00:55:25	Marty2000	Well, I'm going to leave. See you soon, and have a good evening.

2016-06-15 18:05:37	Marty2000	Will it begin one day? Heh
2016-06-15 18:05:44	Marty2000	Yes, it begins
2016-06-15 18:06:14	@PikFan	more Pokemon stuff
2016-06-15 18:06:15	@PikFan	eh
2016-06-15 18:07:19	Marty2000	It's a good series, but I don't have any interest in it. :/ I'll wait
2016-06-15 18:07:57	@PikFan	I'm not interested in anything they're talking about today, unless if it has to do with Zelda
2016-06-15 18:10:39	Yoshi2	PikFan: aren't you excited about that IP they wanted to reveal?
2016-06-15 18:10:50	@PikFan	what IP?
2016-06-15 18:11:11	@PikFan	if I don't even know what you're talking about, then I guess I'm not excited :P
2016-06-15 18:11:57	Marty2000	:)
2016-06-15 18:12:11	Yoshi2	that's the point, we don't yet know that it was they want to reveal
2016-06-15 18:12:15	Marty2000	I'd only be interested if there was any piece of information about Pikmin 4. But the chances are low. Heh
2016-06-15 18:12:20	Marty2000	were*
2016-06-15 18:12:28	@PikFan	no, I mean
2016-06-15 18:12:38	@PikFan	I didn't even know they were going to talk about a new IP
2016-06-15 18:13:04	@PikFan	even so, still eh

2016-06-15 18:15:44	@PikFan	well, maybe I'll look into it once they start talking about it
2016-06-15 18:15:46	Marty2000	Olimar is the main protagonist of this new IP, Im' sure of this
2016-06-15 18:15:53	Marty2000	Joking, I don't know anything :p
2016-06-15 18:16:18	@PikFan	I mean, Splatoon was a new IP
2016-06-15 18:16:24	@PikFan	and I was interested in it
2016-06-15 18:16:29	@PikFan	(still am of course)
2016-06-15 18:16:33	@PikFan	so... maybe
2016-06-15 18:16:45	@PikFan	but "new IP" just doesn't sound appealin
2016-06-15 18:16:48	@PikFan	g
2016-06-15 18:19:20	Yoshi2	it doesn't have to be super duper exciting but I would've expected at least a bit of curiosity
2016-06-15 18:20:25	Yoshi2	considering that it looked a lot like nintendo didn't have anything new in line for 3DS/Wii U besides Zelda and Pokemon
2016-06-15 18:20:31	Yoshi2	and now BAM new rpg IP?
2016-06-15 18:21:12	@PikFan	I said I'll look into it
2016-06-15 18:21:50	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-06-15 18:30:36	@PikFan	alright, I gotta get going

2016-06-15 19:23:43	Marty2000	The current views on Youtube are decreasing... :/ The new IP still looks cool, though
2016-06-15 19:24:33	Marty2000	But, to me, it still is somehow similar to Zelda. Do you have the same feeling, Yoshi2?

2016-06-15 20:03:23	branmon217	is there a 4th one is in development ?
2016-06-15 20:03:32	@Espyo	yeah, they confirmed it

2016-06-15 20:26:11	Marty2000	Hi blue
2016-06-15 20:27:04	blue	okay I have recently been thinking about amiibo ideas and I think I have came up with some really good ones for Pikmin 4
2016-06-15 20:28:25	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-15 20:28:25	blue	I think for Pikmin amiibos that captains could  unlock special missions
2016-06-15 20:28:35	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-06-15 20:28:37	@Espyo	like in Splatoon?
2016-06-15 20:29:19	blue	time challenges single player missions xcetera
2016-06-15 20:29:46	@Espyo	not a bad idea
2016-06-15 20:29:47	@Espyo	I like it
2016-06-15 20:29:50	blue	by doing that you could get perks for multiplayer and story mode
2016-06-15 20:29:57	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-15 20:30:02	@Espyo	that might make it unfair for multiplayer, though
2016-06-15 20:30:07	@Espyo	people with an amiibo get an advantage
2016-06-15 20:30:38	blue	yeah maybe you're right
2016-06-15 20:31:17	blue	on story mode it could work but only for one day
2016-06-15 20:31:23	@Espyo	yaeh
2016-06-15 20:31:24	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-06-15 20:31:27	@Espyo	I actually thought about the amiibo a bit some days ago
2016-06-15 20:31:33	@Espyo	my idea would be that you could scan the Smash line-up of amiibo
2016-06-15 20:31:38	@Espyo	and it'd place the amiibo itself in the game as a treasure
2016-06-15 20:31:48	blue	yeah but what would that do
2016-06-15 20:31:50	@Espyo	it wouldn't do much other than giving you a funny sales pitch or journal entry
2016-06-15 20:32:04	Marty2000	Oh, that's great
2016-06-15 20:32:07	blue	if there is 1
2016-06-15 20:32:11	@Espyo	they wouldn't be very important, but players would be able to use all amiibo on the line-up
2016-06-15 20:32:18	@Espyo	yeah, if there are treasures, and sales pitches
2016-06-15 20:32:45	blue	anyone have ideas for amiibo cards?
2016-06-15 20:33:20	Marty2000	Hmm, it could be used in a similar way to Espyo's amiibos
2016-06-15 20:33:38	Marty2000	But I don't have any ideas, honestly
2016-06-15 20:33:44	@Espyo	"This statuette depicts a red overweight plumber. I mean, I can only assume it is a plumber due to his attire. I wouldn't trust him to be very efficient at physical activities, but since plumbing isn't very physically demanding, I guess it wouldn't matter. Not like I'm one to talk — on my latest space-vacation, I gained a few pounds. Ugh...maybe I shouldn't have had so many red mushrooms..."
2016-06-15 20:33:53	blue	yeah me neither
2016-06-15 20:33:56	@Espyo	ah, yeah, the amiibo cards
2016-06-15 20:34:05	@Espyo	hm, but yeah, no idea, other than the statues
2016-06-15 20:34:12	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-06-15 20:34:34	blue	xD
2016-06-15 20:34:56	@Espyo	it could be fun
2016-06-15 20:35:04	@Espyo	hah, what if he'd recover a statuette of himself?
2016-06-15 20:35:12	Marty2000	Yes, I've just thought of it
2016-06-15 20:35:18	@Espyo	aww man...
2016-06-15 20:35:21	Marty2000	"But... that's.. me!"
2016-06-15 20:35:21	@Espyo	now I ACTUALLY want my idea to be real
2016-06-15 20:35:37	blue	Maybe by using smash amiibos you could use that character for captain
2016-06-15 20:35:40	Marty2000	Same, that would be really fun
2016-06-15 20:35:47	@Espyo	"Have the Pikmin created this as celebration for my first visit?"
2016-06-15 20:35:56	@Espyo	hm, yeah, that'd be neat
2016-06-15 20:36:02	@Espyo	could involve a bit more work than the statues
2016-06-15 20:36:04	@Espyo	not sure if they'd be up for it
2016-06-15 20:36:10	@Espyo	but the statues themselves would probably take work too
2016-06-15 20:36:23	@Espyo	detailed models and textures (since you'll be seeing them up-close, since you're small)
2016-06-15 20:36:27	@Espyo	plus writing descriptions
2016-06-15 20:36:31	@Espyo	for...around 50 characters
2016-06-15 20:36:36	@Espyo	oh
2016-06-15 20:36:39	@Espyo	it could work like Mario Kart 8
2016-06-15 20:36:42	@Espyo	in which only SOME amiibo do stuff
2016-06-15 20:36:50	blue	and certain amiibo wood give you certain abilities in challenge weapon jumping ecsetra
2016-06-15 20:37:01	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-06-15 20:38:17	blue	let's move out of amiibo 4 1 sec and talk about areas
2016-06-15 20:39:15	blue	I think they should add caves
2016-06-15 20:40:59	Marty2000	I'd like a mix of P2 and P3: acves with the day time still passing
2016-06-15 20:40:59	@Espyo	oh, how did that poll go again?
2016-06-15 20:41:03	Marty2000	caves*
2016-06-15 20:41:17	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Poll#Would_you_like_caves_to_return.3F
2016-06-15 20:41:18	Testyo	3 F = -16.1111 °C / 257.039 K
2016-06-15 20:41:23	@Espyo	almost everybody wants them back
2016-06-15 20:41:31	@Espyo	I'd like them back, but they should work differently
2016-06-15 20:41:38	Marty2000	Yes, same, Espyo
2016-06-15 20:41:41	@Espyo	they shouldn't be random, and should be more puzzle-based
2016-06-15 20:41:42	Marty2000	Work differently
2016-06-15 20:41:51	@Espyo	the way they are now adds some replay value, since every trip is different
2016-06-15 20:41:56	blue	and maybe an opposite of caves like tree mazes  or something
2016-06-15 20:41:58	@Espyo	but it doesn't vary enough... it's just weird
2016-06-15 20:42:05	Marty2000	Hmm, I like randomness, though, but they were too easy in P2... and I don't want time to stop in them
2016-06-15 20:42:06	@Espyo	tree mazes?
2016-06-15 20:42:33	@Espyo	I'm also not a fan of the big randomness because, from a game design view point, although it's a good thing, it's horrible for speedrunning
2016-06-15 20:42:46	Marty2000	Yes, true
2016-06-15 20:42:48	blue	yeah they're randomly generated and when you go in there you can find treasure or whatever we are looking for and they would be randomly generated with certain monsters that only found in there
2016-06-15 20:42:51	@Espyo	I'd hate to make a game that could be speedran, but have it being ruined by run-changing randomness
2016-06-15 20:43:03	@Espyo	hm, but that's more or less how caves work already
2016-06-15 20:43:39	blue	yeah but there could be special hazards or Rewards
2016-06-15 20:44:26	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-06-15 20:44:30	blue	and maybe that's where you can only find bulbmin
2016-06-15 20:44:31	Marty2000	Seems like the chances of seeing any piece of news about Pikmin today are... near 0%
2016-06-15 20:45:05	blue	xD
2016-06-15 20:46:27	blue	I think maybe we could see a desert level not just a small one like the final area in Pikmin 3 but a full-out desert with hills and certain hazards like magma or spikes
2016-06-15 20:46:37	Marty2000	Concerning the fruis articles, Espyo, I think we should also add screenshots in them... like what we did for the treasures articles.
2016-06-15 20:46:45	@Espyo	yes, of course
2016-06-15 20:46:54	@Espyo	though, didn't PikFan already upload their original locations?
2016-06-15 20:46:56	Marty2000	Hmm, I think I have ideas on what to add
2016-06-15 20:47:11	Marty2000	Original locations for every piece of a certain fruit
2016-06-15 20:47:13	blue	what is it?
2016-06-15 20:47:14	Marty2000	and being analyzed
2016-06-15 20:47:17	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-06-15 20:47:46	@Espyo	blue: what's what?
2016-06-15 20:47:53	Marty2000	And Brittany's comment, maybe? 
2016-06-15 20:48:10	@Espyo	I don't think it'd add anything that text wouldn't already show...
2016-06-15 20:48:11	blue	sorry bad timing I'm using voice type on my tablet
2016-06-15 20:48:12	Marty2000	Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Astringent_Clump
2016-06-15 20:48:35	@Espyo	oh, hah
2016-06-15 20:48:37	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-15 20:48:48	Marty2000	Hmm, we only have one image
2016-06-15 20:48:53	@Espyo	huh?
2016-06-15 20:48:56	@Espyo	there's like 6 images there
2016-06-15 20:49:04	blue	?
2016-06-15 20:49:05	Marty2000	of the fruit in-game
2016-06-15 20:49:20	Marty2000	I mean, we can't really see its oriignal locationS
2016-06-15 20:49:25	Marty2000	its original*
2016-06-15 20:49:25	blue	what are we talking about
2016-06-15 20:49:53	Marty2000	Oh, they are already here
2016-06-15 20:49:57	Marty2000	Excuse my dumbness
2016-06-15 20:49:58	blue	I think maybe there should B cold hazards
2016-06-15 20:49:58	@Espyo	yeah, outside the gallery
2016-06-15 20:50:00	@Espyo	hehe, it's fine
2016-06-15 20:50:06	@Espyo	blue: yeah, they might add them
2016-06-15 20:50:31	Marty2000	Yes, Pikfan already added them
2016-06-15 20:50:34	Marty2000	So it's fine here
2016-06-15 20:51:31	Marty2000	Time to check P2 treasures to see if I added images for all of them
2016-06-15 20:51:42	blue	if a pikmin  is not resistant to it stays out in cold areas for too long like maybe 5 minutes or so then they would die
2016-06-15 20:53:07	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Combustion_Berry I think we need a screenshot of its (andom) location in the cave it's found in
2016-06-15 20:53:13	Marty2000	random
2016-06-15 20:53:40	blue	I think Pikmin would be resistant too cold will be cyan pikmin having fur
2016-06-15 20:53:49	@Espyo	I don't think images in caves make sense
2016-06-15 20:53:57	@Espyo	like I said, images work best to show stuff visually that's hard to explain by text
2016-06-15 20:54:06	blue	.......................
2016-06-15 20:54:09	@Espyo	so, its exact location and surroundings, and its appearance
2016-06-15 20:54:19	@Espyo	so having it in a cave is a bit pointless
2016-06-15 20:54:26	blue	......................................................
2016-06-15 20:54:27	@Espyo	blue: that could make the game too limiting
2016-06-15 20:54:43	Marty2000	Okay, Espyo
2016-06-15 20:55:16	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Seed_of_Greed Well, I think we coul add a screenshot of this one's original location, though (it's above ground)
2016-06-15 20:55:22	blue	well maybe in Cold caves or an enemy with an ice attack they will be helpful
2016-06-15 20:55:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-15 20:56:42	blue	like if a bullborb with dice attack which can stun Pikmin the cyan Pikmin will not be affected by it
2016-06-15 20:57:00	blue	*ice
2016-06-15 20:57:21	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-15 20:57:57	blue	I wonder who the captains are going to be
2016-06-15 20:58:42	blue	they are going to be after Louie that's almost certain
2016-06-15 20:58:55	@Espyo	yeah, seems likely
2016-06-15 20:59:03	@Espyo	well, looks like they're taking their time with Pikmin 4
2016-06-15 20:59:06	@Espyo	so probably new captains

2016-06-15 21:00:22	blue	if Pikmin 4 is like the others they are probably going to have four captains
2016-06-15 21:01:28	@Espyo	they did try four captains for Pikmin 3, but removed it
2016-06-15 21:01:33	@Espyo	so maybe, maybe not
2016-06-15 21:01:39	blue	my battery is running low I got to go so I guess I'll see you later

2016-06-15 21:10:29	Marty2000	Well, they probably didn't announce it, but I was wondering so, so no problem. Thanks for responding. I think I can forget Pikmin for this E3 :/ I'll still listen to the Treehouse while doing something else

2016-06-15 22:25:59	@Espyo	good grief
2016-06-15 22:26:03	@Espyo	there's so much Winged Pikmin jank
2016-06-15 22:26:29	Marty2000	Yeah, that's why their one of my favorite species :p That's interesting, and I know how to get either animation at will

2016-06-15 22:27:05	Marty2000	blue: we found out they sometimes walk
2016-06-15 22:27:37	blue	interesting speaking of Pikmin why don't we discussed about Pikmin types for Pikmin 4
2016-06-15 22:28:02	blue	* discuss
2016-06-15 22:29:18	Marty2000	they're one*

2016-06-15 22:30:31	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-15 22:30:52	blue	since they usually gives colors that are too close to other colors colors like violet or black Pikmin will probably not be in Pikmin 4
2016-06-15 22:31:00	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-15 22:32:12	blue	pretty much the only remaining colors AR orange green cyan & Brown
2016-06-15 22:33:18	blue	and following Nintendo's Pikmin sorting Reds will probably be discovered first and lose will be discovered last
2016-06-15 22:34:03	Marty2000	Hmm, come to think of it, I can be wrong, but I think they made Red Pikmin the first species to be always discovered at first because... they're not mandatory

2016-06-15 23:42:40	Scruffy	With Nintendo having its Treehouse lately

2016-06-15 23:43:22	Scruffy	I could create a preview of Pikmin: Color Splash in Blender
2016-06-15 23:43:40	Scruffy	It'd be easy since all the objects are paper surfaces

2016-06-16 00:13:23	Scruffy	They just showed Zelda
2016-06-16 00:13:40	@PikFan	ah, they showed more of it? nice
2016-06-16 00:14:01	Scruffy	I didn't watch it though, don't want any spoilers, even the ones Nintendo allows me to see
2016-06-16 00:14:05	@PikFan	Yoshi2 alerted me to a "new roleplaying IP" earlier today

2016-06-16 00:14:15	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-16 00:14:34	@PikFan	so what's that about?
2016-06-16 00:14:53	Scruffy	From my understanding, it's a mix of Legend of Zelda's adventuring with Animal Crossing's city building
2016-06-16 00:14:57	Scruffy	All set in a big desert
2016-06-16 00:15:02	Scruffy	You build your own oasis
2016-06-16 00:15:10	Scruffy	And other players online can visit it
2016-06-16 00:15:41	Scruffy	And then you venture out and explore to find things for it and defeat the evil enemy
2016-06-16 00:16:12	Scruffy	It got more interesting as I watched
2016-06-16 00:16:28	Scruffy	You plant seeds in your oasis that become shops and houses

2016-06-16 00:21:42	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-16 00:21:52	Scruffy	And I got the idea to make a E3-like video of Pikmin Color Splash
2016-06-16 00:21:52	@PikFan	I wonder how people feel about it now
2016-06-16 00:22:03	Scruffy	I actually kind of like the look of it
2016-06-16 00:22:05	@PikFan	heh, of course :P
2016-06-16 00:22:13	Scruffy	It'd be easy in Blender

2016-06-16 00:28:45	CreativeSushi	Hey scruffy
2016-06-16 00:28:46	@PikFan	but they've already done these areas
2016-06-16 00:29:02	CreativeSushi	Oh really? I was at work all day yesterday so I didn't get to watch
2016-06-16 00:29:07	@PikFan	ah
2016-06-16 00:29:13	@PikFan	well, it all works out!
2016-06-16 00:29:18	CreativeSushi	yup yup
2016-06-16 00:29:20	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-16 00:29:35	@PikFan	I am so hyped
2016-06-16 00:29:51	@PikFan	it looks so fantastically gorgeous
2016-06-16 00:30:03	CreativeSushi	They said they had like hundreds of these shrines in the game?
2016-06-16 00:30:07	CreativeSushi	thats mightily impressive 
2016-06-16 00:30:13	@PikFan	well not hundreds
2016-06-16 00:30:20	@PikFan	but OVER a hundred
2016-06-16 00:30:24	CreativeSushi	right
2016-06-16 00:30:31	CreativeSushi	thats insane
2016-06-16 00:30:35	@PikFan	I know
2016-06-16 00:30:42	@PikFan	and those are just the Shrines
2016-06-16 00:30:50	@PikFan	I wonder how many main dungeons there will be
2016-06-16 00:31:07	CreativeSushi	I heard 4, but I could be very wrong
2016-06-16 00:31:15	@PikFan	I've heard that too
2016-06-16 00:31:31	@PikFan	apparently some relationship to Majora's Mask
2016-06-16 00:31:46	CreativeSushi	and there done with zelda
2016-06-16 00:32:03	@PikFan	I dunno, I feel like the game might be related to Wind Waker because of the Koroks
2016-06-16 00:32:10	CreativeSushi	Rythm heaven next
2016-06-16 00:32:15	CreativeSushi	and apparently thats it
2016-06-16 00:32:38	Scruffy	Dang it
2016-06-16 00:32:47	Scruffy	I got so hyped at "one more surprise for you"
2016-06-16 00:32:53	CreativeSushi	same
2016-06-16 00:33:31	@PikFan	heh, what was the surprise?
2016-06-16 00:33:46	@PikFan	oh, Rhythm Heaven
2016-06-16 00:33:47	@PikFan	eh
2016-06-16 00:33:55	CreativeSushi	not even a surprise 
2016-06-16 00:34:13	@PikFan	I wonder when they'll reveal Pikmin 4...
2016-06-16 00:34:14	@PikFan	sigh
2016-06-16 00:34:32	@PikFan	I really hope we don't have to wait for another 6 years
2016-06-16 00:34:41	CreativeSushi	yeah
2016-06-16 00:34:46	CreativeSushi	lots of people are saying its canceled
2016-06-16 00:34:53	@PikFan	because the other day, I was thinking
2016-06-16 00:35:06	@PikFan	back in 2008, they said they were working on the "next installment"
2016-06-16 00:35:12	@PikFan	ie. Pikmin 3
2016-06-16 00:35:18	@PikFan	which didn't come out until 5 years later
2016-06-16 00:35:40	@PikFan	so similarly, they have confirmed the existence of Pikmin 4...
2016-06-16 00:35:45	@PikFan	but it might not be out for a while
2016-06-16 00:35:55	@PikFan	the thing is, Miyamoto said they're almost done
2016-06-16 00:36:08	@PikFan	so it might be out sooner than later
2016-06-16 00:36:15	@PikFan	but the question is, just how soon?
2016-06-16 00:36:23	CreativeSushi	not wii u soon
2016-06-16 00:36:25	CreativeSushi	is my guess
2016-06-16 00:36:32	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-16 00:36:45	@PikFan	I mean, it's been 9 months since that interview
2016-06-16 00:36:51	Scruffy	They might make it compatible with wii u though...?
2016-06-16 00:37:01	@PikFan	I guess what they consider "almost done" isn't actually almost done
2016-06-16 00:37:02	Scruffy	Actually never mind
2016-06-16 00:37:12	@PikFan	probably like halfway done
2016-06-16 00:37:13	CreativeSushi	guys what if like
2016-06-16 00:37:19	CreativeSushi	the nx is a low-tier console
2016-06-16 00:37:25	CreativeSushi	and the wii u is the superior console
2016-06-16 00:37:29	CreativeSushi	but the nx is really cheap
2016-06-16 00:37:33	@PikFan	plot twist :o
2016-06-16 00:37:33	CreativeSushi	and the point of the nx
2016-06-16 00:37:38	CreativeSushi	is to like push the wii u
2016-06-16 00:37:47	CreativeSushi	because you get more features with it
2016-06-16 00:37:48	CreativeSushi	yeah
2016-06-16 00:37:48	Scruffy	Woah
2016-06-16 00:37:54	CreativeSushi	like how they released the 2ds
2016-06-16 00:37:56	Marty2000	According to Ubisoft, the NX is a good console. That's all I could see
2016-06-16 00:38:05	CreativeSushi	and then later released the new 3ds
2016-06-16 00:38:15	@PikFan	well, I imagine a lot of people would be extremely upset
2016-06-16 00:38:22	@PikFan	because there's so much hype for it
2016-06-16 00:38:31	@PikFan	only to find out it's this little supplementary thing
2016-06-16 00:38:35	CreativeSushi	yeah probably, and I'm mostly joking
2016-06-16 00:38:43	@PikFan	...oh
2016-06-16 00:38:46	CreativeSushi	but that would be a very surprising plot twist
2016-06-16 00:38:46	@PikFan	okay
2016-06-16 00:38:51	@PikFan	I'll... just leave now :P
2016-06-16 00:39:00	@PikFan	(I'm very bad with sarcasm)
2016-06-16 00:39:14	@PikFan	((I'm a very black and white person))
2016-06-16 00:39:36	CreativeSushi	well, Its not so much that I was joking, just that I don't believe my own theory at all
2016-06-16 00:39:50	@PikFan	heh, alright
2016-06-16 00:39:53	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-06-16 00:40:01	@PikFan	I wanna know how Pikmin 4 is doing
2016-06-16 00:40:18	Scruffy	I
2016-06-16 00:40:30	Scruffy	I'm still really hoping that at the very end of this livestream
2016-06-16 00:40:33	CreativeSushi	who knows
2016-06-16 00:40:42	@PikFan	why doesn't Nintendo like focusing on long term projects
2016-06-16 00:40:47	CreativeSushi	someone might run into miyamoto on the e3 floor 
2016-06-16 00:40:53	CreativeSushi	and he might just spill the beans on some info
2016-06-16 00:40:57	CreativeSushi	miyamoto tens to do that
2016-06-16 00:41:01	CreativeSushi	*tends
2016-06-16 00:41:05	@PikFan	because that was their reason for not showing Zelda last year
2016-06-16 00:41:14	Scruffy	They're just like "Oh hey also for you Pikmin fans out there the next installment is doing really well, we'll release some info in a little while
2016-06-16 00:41:27	@PikFan	so many subjective words
2016-06-16 00:41:41	@PikFan	a little while ends up being 5 years
2016-06-16 00:42:28	Scruffy	What if Miyamoto just said that because his idea of Pikmin 4 was almost done, but once it was released to press the developers realized people were expecting a game really soon
2016-06-16 00:42:42	CreativeSushi	huh
2016-06-16 00:43:02	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2016-06-16 00:43:16	@PikFan	little nuances like that can get lost in translation...
2016-06-16 00:43:31	Scruffy	If anything I'm fine waiting as long as Pikmin 4 doesn't suffer from console transfer jetlag
2016-06-16 00:43:36	Scruffy	Like Pikmin 3 did a bit
2016-06-16 00:44:16	CreativeSushi	I just want pikmin 4 to have more content and less bugs
2016-06-16 00:44:23	@PikFan	same
2016-06-16 00:44:29	@PikFan	6-7 areas please
2016-06-16 00:44:49	CreativeSushi	and when I say content I don't necessarily mean new pikmin types
2016-06-16 00:44:56	CreativeSushi	just new areas, ideas, storyline
2016-06-16 00:45:01	Scruffy	Piklopedia please
2016-06-16 00:45:07	@PikFan	^^^^
2016-06-16 00:45:08	CreativeSushi	that would be nice too
2016-06-16 00:45:16	Marty2000	Please, I want glitches :p
2016-06-16 00:45:24	Scruffy	I missed that so much, it gave Pikmin 2 so much wit
2016-06-16 00:45:28	@PikFan	hah
2016-06-16 00:45:39	@PikFan	@Marty
2016-06-16 00:45:39	Marty2000	Yes, the Piklopedia was cool...
2016-06-16 00:45:58	Marty2000	Even in Pikmin (1), you had the enemy reel... but no such thing in pikmin 3
2016-06-16 00:46:10	Marty2000	Pikmin*
2016-06-16 00:46:11	@PikFan	it was a way to really characterize the characters
2016-06-16 00:46:14	@PikFan	without dialog
2016-06-16 00:46:18	@PikFan	it was very clever
2016-06-16 00:48:08	@PikFan	someone said this in regards to BotW:
2016-06-16 00:48:10	@PikFan	"It's a "breath" of fresh air to the series.﻿"

2016-06-16 01:07:16	Scruffy	Yep
2016-06-16 01:07:34	Scruffy	They had a lot more to unveil than I thought they did though
2016-06-16 01:07:46	Scruffy	Most of it pretty cool
2016-06-16 01:08:05	Scruffy	Except I don't own a 3DS :/
2016-06-16 01:08:15	@PikFan	that sucks
2016-06-16 01:09:40	Scruffy	It's okay, my Wii U is still plenty fun
2016-06-16 01:09:52	Scruffy	I just got the DLC for Mario Kart 8 yesterday
2016-06-16 01:09:56	Scruffy	That was really cool

2016-06-16 01:18:02	Marty2000	The only thing that caught my attention at this E3 was Paper Mario. I hope you guys found something you liked :)
2016-06-16 01:18:28	@PikFan	what about Zelda though?
2016-06-16 01:18:48	@PikFan	I thought you were excited about it?
2016-06-16 01:19:32	Marty2000	Well, I don't really like Zelda. It's a great game, sure... but I tried, and it's not really for me... though, I have to admit this one looks cool. I'm looking forward to getting more information on it, though. 
2016-06-16 01:19:49	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-06-16 01:20:08	@PikFan	what about it don't you like?
2016-06-16 01:20:43	Marty2000	Hmm... It's hard to describe, but probably the game in general (dungeons, puzzles, etc...)
2016-06-16 01:20:58	@PikFan	hmm
2016-06-16 01:22:13	@PikFan	Pikmin is also puzzle-centered, though...
2016-06-16 01:22:41	Marty2000	Yeah :p
2016-06-16 01:23:33	Marty2000	Well, maybe I haven't played it enough to like it... but I just can't
2016-06-16 01:24:28	@PikFan	hmm
2016-06-16 01:24:30	Marty2000	But anyway, Kirby was released nnearly a week ago, plenty of fun for me
2016-06-16 01:24:40	Marty2000	nearly*
2016-06-16 01:24:43	@PikFan	well, you've expressed an interest in this new one, so perhaps this one will be the one for you!
2016-06-16 01:24:52	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-06-16 01:28:02	@PikFan	oh man, I'd love it if Splatoon 2 had a larger campaign
2016-06-16 01:28:16	Marty2000	Ha, yeah
2016-06-16 01:28:32	@PikFan	and especially if you could explore Inkopolis
2016-06-16 01:28:40	Marty2000	The current game has a good campaign, but it's short
2016-06-16 01:28:50	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-06-16 01:28:52	Marty2000	Yeah, that would be cool to expand on the game

2016-06-16 01:29:58	@PikFan	you were on earlier?
2016-06-16 01:30:05	blue	so what you guys up to
2016-06-16 01:30:16	Marty2000	Yes, he was, PikFan$

2016-06-16 01:30:28	@PikFan	well yeah :P
2016-06-16 01:30:43	@PikFan	oh, we were talking about ideas for Splatoon
2016-06-16 01:31:40	blue	( facepalm himself) this is a Pikmin chat room not Splatoon chat room
2016-06-16 01:31:59	@PikFan	so what
2016-06-16 01:32:32	blue	so we should probably be talking about Pikmin stuff like we're supposed to
2016-06-16 01:32:43	@PikFan	except we're not
2016-06-16 01:33:05	blue	well then start doing it
2016-06-16 01:33:25	blue	NOW
2016-06-16 01:33:40	@PikFan	first off, could you cut the sass? thanks
2016-06-16 01:33:52	@PikFan	secondly, we don't have to talk about Pikmin
2016-06-16 01:34:15	@PikFan	just because it's a channel for the wiki doesn't mean we have to talk exclusively for Pikmin

2016-06-16 01:35:11	@PikFan	Espyo probably could've handled that better
2016-06-16 01:35:37	@PikFan	I mean, "first off, could you cut the sass?" is in and of itself pretty sassy

2016-06-16 01:35:57	@PikFan	did he try forcing you guys to talk about Pikmin
2016-06-16 01:36:21	Marty2000	Hmm... he was talking about ideas for Pikmin 4
2016-06-16 01:36:31	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-16 01:36:32	Marty2000	Only
2016-06-16 01:36:43	@PikFan	nothing wrong with that
2016-06-16 01:36:58	@PikFan	but demanding people to talk about only Pikmin is wrong

2016-06-16 16:15:58	@PikFan	hi
2016-06-16 16:16:08	@PikFan	so today's the last day of school
2016-06-16 16:16:18	@PikFan	really excited for school to end :D
2016-06-16 16:17:09	Marty2000	PikFan, hello
2016-06-16 16:17:14	Marty2000	Good :)
2016-06-16 16:17:16	@PikFan	hi
2016-06-16 16:17:18	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-16 16:17:33	Marty2000	And I'm also happy, I've managed to find a way to play the American version of NPC!P1
2016-06-16 16:17:51	Marty2000	Which will help me find the French and Spanish names for this version
2016-06-16 16:18:14	Marty2000	Anyway, what will you do on that last day of school?
2016-06-16 16:18:39	@PikFan	well, some kind of special "project" in my math class involving compasses
2016-06-16 16:18:51	@PikFan	then a party in my Japanese class
2016-06-16 16:19:01	@PikFan	...and my final exam in physics
2016-06-16 16:19:02	Marty2000	Cool :)
2016-06-16 16:19:10	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-16 16:19:40	M6	oh yeah pikfan
2016-06-16 16:19:45	M6	how was your school year?
2016-06-16 16:19:58	@PikFan	hi M6
2016-06-16 16:20:01	@PikFan	it was eh
2016-06-16 16:20:03	Marty2000	Hi M6
2016-06-16 16:20:12	M6	heyo Marty2000
2016-06-16 16:20:14	M6	why was it eh?
2016-06-16 16:20:14	@PikFan	how about yours?
2016-06-16 16:20:18	M6	mine was fantastic
2016-06-16 16:20:21	@PikFan	because it's school
2016-06-16 16:20:24	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-16 16:20:35	M6	school is pretty fun, I think
2016-06-16 16:20:40	@PikFan	school is always eh
2016-06-16 16:20:44	@PikFan	for me anyway
2016-06-16 16:20:58	M6	as messed up as the American education system is, great things still h appen
2016-06-16 16:21:38	@PikFan	eh
2016-06-16 16:22:04	@PikFan	what strikes me is that you appear out of nowhere to ask me how it was :P
2016-06-16 16:22:19	M6	I randomly decided to click on the pikipedia tab
2016-06-16 16:22:24	M6	and realized you said school
2016-06-16 16:22:34	M6	and also realized that I hadn't asked you how school was in a long time
2016-06-16 16:22:40	@PikFan	what a coincidence, heh
2016-06-16 16:22:48	Marty2000	We don't see you often, but well, that's funny to see you appear like that :D
2016-06-16 16:24:16	@PikFan	it was mainly eh because of english classes
2016-06-16 16:24:16	M6	I'm always lurking here
2016-06-16 16:24:21	@PikFan	I despise english
2016-06-16 16:24:24	M6	SAME
2016-06-16 16:24:30	M6	English is by far my worst class
2016-06-16 16:24:46	M6	and least favorite
2016-06-16 16:24:51	@PikFan	yyyyyyyyyup
2016-06-16 16:24:56	M6	what did you have to do in your English class?
2016-06-16 16:25:14	@PikFan	oh, just read a couple of books and talked about current events
2016-06-16 16:25:37	M6	that actually sounds kind of fun
2016-06-16 16:25:39	M6	well, not the books part
2016-06-16 16:25:45	M6	but I enjoy talking about current events
2016-06-16 16:26:06	@PikFan	second half was harder because we were reading plays :(
2016-06-16 16:26:49	M6	ouch
2016-06-16 16:26:57	M6	plays often aren't all that fun
2016-06-16 16:27:38	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-06-16 16:27:54	@PikFan	this year was okay
2016-06-16 16:27:59	@PikFan	but next year... oh boy
2016-06-16 16:28:30	@PikFan	I'm gonna have a ton of classes I don't want
2016-06-16 16:28:38	@PikFan	and I'm gonna be doing a bunch of testing
2016-06-16 16:28:46	@PikFan	and I'm gonna have to do a job shadow ._.
2016-06-16 16:29:44	M6	you're in 11th grade next year, right?
2016-06-16 16:29:57	@PikFan	yes
2016-06-16 16:30:00	M6	ah
2016-06-16 16:30:21	@PikFan	junior year really will be the hardest year
2016-06-16 16:30:29	M6	it was for me, by far
2016-06-16 16:30:34	@PikFan	aren't you a senior next year?
2016-06-16 16:30:37	M6	yep
2016-06-16 16:30:41	@PikFan	nice
2016-06-16 16:30:48	M6	Do you have AP classes in your school?
2016-06-16 16:31:19	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-16 16:31:23	@PikFan	but I'm avoiding them
2016-06-16 16:31:27	M6	oh
2016-06-16 16:31:37	M6	they're actually not all that bad
2016-06-16 16:31:39	@PikFan	I want to have as little homework as possible
2016-06-16 16:31:59	@PikFan	and AP classes have more homework
2016-06-16 16:32:00	@PikFan	so...
2016-06-16 16:32:08	M6	well, not necessarily
2016-06-16 16:32:13	M6	although your school is far different than mine
2016-06-16 16:32:17	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-16 16:32:21	M6	do you have study halls?
2016-06-16 16:32:25	@PikFan	yes
2016-06-16 16:32:36	M6	lucky lucky
2016-06-16 16:32:47	@PikFan	well, I mean, yeah not necessarily more homework, but it's just harder
2016-06-16 16:32:53	@PikFan	heh, do you not have any?
2016-06-16 16:33:03	M6	my school offers them, but I didn't get any
2016-06-16 16:33:07	@PikFan	ouch
2016-06-16 16:33:16	M6	after signing up for all AP and honors courses, I wanted a dang study hall
2016-06-16 16:33:28	M6	I'll just skip lunch again
2016-06-16 16:33:32	M6	that's how I survived last year
2016-06-16 16:33:43	@PikFan	how long is lunch?
2016-06-16 16:33:51	M6	approximately 30 minutes
2016-06-16 16:33:57	M6	so maybe I can get half of an assignment done
2016-06-16 16:34:53	@PikFan	that's really short
2016-06-16 16:34:58	@PikFan	ours is 40 minutes
2016-06-16 16:35:03	@PikFan	which is still pretty short
2016-06-16 16:35:45	M6	your school sounds like a much better place honestly
2016-06-16 16:36:01	M6	I'd love a 40-minute lunch
2016-06-16 16:36:07	M6	not just because I want less class time
2016-06-16 16:36:17	M6	but because I'm often pushing my 30 minutes to the very end (when I do actually eat)
2016-06-16 16:37:18	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-16 16:41:34	@PikFan	hey, so
2016-06-16 16:41:39	@PikFan	did you see the new Zelda?

2016-06-16 16:59:54	Yoshi2	[17:24:30] <M6> English is by far my worst class
2016-06-16 16:59:55	Yoshi2	[17:24:46] <M6> and least favorite
2016-06-16 17:00:03	Yoshi2	English was one of my best subjects .-.
2016-06-16 17:00:08	Yoshi2	better than German
2016-06-16 17:00:09	@PikFan	lucky you
2016-06-16 17:00:14	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-06-16 17:00:50	@PikFan	it seems like any language class you take that isn't your native language is better than the class for your native language
2016-06-16 17:01:27	Marty2000	Yoshi2: English is one of my best, with French and Spanish
2016-06-16 17:01:42	@PikFan	Japanese is one of my best
2016-06-16 17:02:09	Yoshi2	in German you could get a lot of marks through bullshitting which I'm not good at
2016-06-16 17:02:36	Yoshi2	interpret "The floor is blue."
2016-06-16 17:03:03	Yoshi2	how you have to do it: "The main character is very depressed which made him decorate the room as such"
2016-06-16 17:03:14	Yoshi2	How I'd do it: "the floor is fucking blue"
2016-06-16 17:03:17	Marty2000	I... see.
2016-06-16 17:03:23	@PikFan	hah, me too
2016-06-16 17:04:59	Yoshi2	English class had less of such bullcrap, so naturally my marks were better
2016-06-16 17:10:14	Marty2000	English class is too easy. Apparently, it wasn't the case some decades ago, but it has become very simple. That's also why I'm moslty self-taught (and also, I know English thanks to video-games). I don't know if it's the same for every high school of France, but we're still learning things like "My name is...". I guess it's needed, since pupils do not have 
2016-06-16 17:10:20	Marty2000	amazing marks in English here.
2016-06-16 17:10:52	@PikFan	heh
2016-06-16 17:11:05	@PikFan	can I... ask you something?
2016-06-16 17:11:13	Marty2000	But well, I'm quite fed up of learning "My name is...." every day. I would like to learn something else
2016-06-16 17:11:16	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-06-16 17:11:32	@PikFan	say something really long in French
2016-06-16 17:11:35	@PikFan	:P
2016-06-16 17:11:45	Marty2000	Hmm, what kind of phrase would you like me to say?

2016-06-16 17:12:00	Marty2000	Okay

Depuis, j'ai découvert beaucoup de glitches, qui m'aident à comprendre un peu mieux comment le jeu fonctionne. C'est devenu une sorte de passe-temps. J'espère en découvrir d'aures, car c'est vraiment fun.

2016-06-16 17:15:05	@PikFan	is that what the first sentence said?
2016-06-16 17:15:10	Marty2000	No, I have been playing it since I'm 9
2016-06-16 17:15:14	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-16 17:15:23	Marty2000	But it's tricky, don't worry 
2016-06-16 17:15:29	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-06-16 17:16:34	Marty2000	However, I love how some words are very similar in both English and French
2016-06-16 17:16:54	Marty2000	Sometimes, they have different meanings, though.
2016-06-16 17:19:44	@PikFan	yeah
2016-06-16 17:20:08	@PikFan	most people can read a piece of text in Spanish or French and pick out certain words
2016-06-16 17:20:15	@PikFan	Japanese, on the other hand...
2016-06-16 17:20:28	@PikFan	you can't do anything if you don't know the characters :P
2016-06-16 17:20:31	Marty2000	Yeah, Japanese is very different from English, so...

2016-06-16 18:52:47	Marty2000	and Testyo
2016-06-16 18:52:47	Testyo	in the sunset bulborb, an eye hitbox overlaps the mouth hitbox in it
2016-06-16 18:55:35	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-16 18:58:16	Marty2000	So, I managed to get the US version of NPC! P1, I'm playing it in order to find French and Spanish names. I can already tell there are differences between the American and European version (and oddities too).
2016-06-16 19:01:43	@Espyo	heh, I bet
2016-06-16 19:02:00	Marty2000	Here's an example
2016-06-16 19:02:29	Marty2000	The Forest of Hope, in the European version, is always called "La Forêt de l'Espoir" in French. In the American version... it depends:
2016-06-16 19:02:43	Marty2000	on the area selection screen, it's "La Forêt de l'espoir"
2016-06-16 19:02:55	Marty2000	on the loading screen, it's "La Forêt de l'Espoir"
2016-06-16 19:03:00	Marty2000	Heh...
2016-06-16 19:05:11	@Espyo	wow, that inconsistency...
2016-06-16 19:05:37	Marty2000	Yeah, even more inconsistent when you see the following thing:
2016-06-16 19:05:53	Marty2000	In the European version, The Impact Site is "Le Site du Crash"
2016-06-16 19:06:07	Marty2000	In the American version, it's "Le site de l'écrasement", and it doesn't change
2016-06-16 19:06:26	Marty2000	I will not mention the ship parts...
2016-06-16 19:09:07	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-16 19:09:38	Marty2000	Hmm, by the way, in the Pilot's Seat French description, they mention a character (they don't in the English version)
2016-06-16 19:09:41	Marty2000	"Namuk VI"
2016-06-16 19:09:48	Marty2000	I have no idea who it might be...
2016-06-16 19:11:44	@Espyo	woah
2016-06-16 19:11:48	@Espyo	doesn't ring a bell either
2016-06-16 19:23:28	Marty2000	Ah, finally, you remember that Bulborbs (and other creatures) have different sounds in NPC!P1 (America and Japan)
2016-06-16 19:23:39	Marty2000	Even though it's corrected in the European version...
2016-06-16 19:24:08	Marty2000	in the latter version, Onions have different sounds when they spit out seeds, or retrieve corpses, pellets....
2016-06-16 19:25:52	@Espyo	good grief...

2016-06-16 20:13:52	@Espyo	I vote FWE, makes more sense to me

2016-06-16 23:19:50	Marty2000	Ah, it seems that you need to see every attack of the concerned enemy to get its log (so, in the case of the Smoky Progg: kills Pikmin with its gaz trail and uproot them).

2016-06-16 23:25:35	@Espyo	huh
2016-06-16 23:25:37	@Espyo	that's weird
2016-06-16 23:25:43	@Espyo	kinda specific
2016-06-16 23:25:49	@Espyo	there might be other mechanics at play
2016-06-16 23:26:00	@Espyo	like, the longer you spend time with an enemy, the higher the chance you'll get an entry?
2016-06-16 23:26:14	@Espyo	you could try to have no big priorities on the log entry list
2016-06-16 23:26:20	@Espyo	and then spend like half a day with an enemy
2016-06-16 23:26:23	@Espyo	to see if you get a log of it
2016-06-16 23:26:26	@Espyo	without attacking or killing
2016-06-16 23:26:41	@Espyo	because I'd find it pretty tough to make it so you had to see all animations before it being logged
2016-06-16 23:26:51	@Espyo	not to mention that maybe it wouldn't make a whole load of sense
2016-06-16 23:27:01	@Espyo	for instance, Bulborbs have an animation for missing an attack
2016-06-16 23:27:09	@Espyo	in the middle of a busy fight, that doesn't happen
2016-06-16 23:27:32	@Espyo	so I doubt that you'd need to see it walk, sleep, wake up, shake, lunge, fail, chomp, die, etc. just for the log entry
2016-06-16 23:27:46	@Espyo	oh, just realized you said "attack", not "animation"
2016-06-16 23:27:47	@Espyo	but still
2016-06-16 23:28:15	Marty2000	Well, I tried a lot of things
2016-06-16 23:28:30	Marty2000	And I got the log when the SMoky Progg had shown all of its attack, actually
2016-06-16 23:28:33	Marty2000	So I might be wrong
2016-06-16 23:28:40	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-16 23:28:44	Marty2000	But that's what I could see...
2016-06-16 23:29:05	Marty2000	It was impossible to get the log if it didn't uproot Pikmin (I'd get "bored" stuff)
2016-06-16 23:29:25	@Espyo	wow
2016-06-16 23:29:28	Marty2000	if it hadn't uprooted any Pikmin
2016-06-16 23:31:30	Marty2000	Anyway, I'll seacrh for more information on this and I'll tell you what I can find ;)

2016-06-16 23:34:19	@Espyo	cool

2016-06-17 11:21:44	Marty2000	Hello everybody
2016-06-17 11:36:11	Yoshi2	hi Marty2000 
2016-06-17 11:36:16	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2
2016-06-17 11:45:08	Yoshi2	Marty2000: a TCRF admin modified the article and... ignored the stuff I wrote in the talk page https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Pikmin_2/Unused_%26_Early_Treasures&action=history
2016-06-17 11:45:29	Yoshi2	so here is my plan
2016-06-17 11:45:35	Yoshi2	1) I make a BW article
2016-06-17 11:45:40	Yoshi2	and at a later point
2016-06-17 11:45:59	Marty2000	Shh... they really are bothersome :/
2016-06-17 11:46:07	Yoshi2	I will YOLO it and undo the change (with a reference to the talk page, of course)
2016-06-17 11:46:34	Marty2000	Good plan, he he. It's surprising there's no BW article, though
2016-06-17 11:46:53	Yoshi2	there is one for BWii
2016-06-17 11:47:00	Yoshi2	but with some lackluster content
2016-06-17 11:47:08	Marty2000	Yeah, but no one about the Gamecube version
2016-06-17 11:49:30	Yoshi2	they are two different games
2016-06-17 11:49:40	Yoshi2	so quite a bit of content to be found for both
2016-06-17 11:49:40	Marty2000	Oh, by the way, Yoshi2... I added even more German names to Pikipedia, recently :p  http://www.pikminwiki.com/Ship_part
2016-06-17 11:50:05	Marty2000	Yeah, I know... (when I meant Gamecube version, I meant the Gamecube game)
2016-06-17 11:59:45	Yoshi2	the BW article will be to protect myself from "hurr durr I'm that guy whose biggest concern is this tank thing"

2016-06-17 12:07:06	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-17 12:09:03	Yoshi2	"Hauptantrieb" (in context of that Main Engine) could be translated as main engine, but hnnnngggg
2016-06-17 12:09:45	Yoshi2	Antrieb literally means propulsion
2016-06-17 12:10:58	Marty2000	I hope you like those names, he he ;)
2016-06-17 12:11:05	Yoshi2	how would you feel about Main Propulsion
2016-06-17 12:11:26	Marty2000	Main Propulsion sounds good to me (and you guessed it: funny)
2016-06-17 12:12:18	Marty2000	German and Italian are the most consistent versions, by the way
2016-06-17 12:12:31	Marty2000	Spanish is okay, even though it sometimes changes between America and Erope
2016-06-17 12:12:50	Marty2000	And French is just an enormous mess which contains inconsistency, mistakes.... and differences :p
2016-06-17 12:14:50	Marty2000	By the way, there's normally another name for that ship part in the German version as well (I have to find it)
2016-06-17 12:15:28	Yoshi2	should I keep the dash in the translation of Positron-Generator?
2016-06-17 12:15:47	Yoshi2	if not, then the meaning for that is just Positron Generator :P
2016-06-17 12:15:47	Marty2000	I'd say yes
2016-06-17 12:16:27	Marty2000	There are several ship parts with dash translations but I preferred to have your opinion on it before adding translations myself
2016-06-17 12:17:01	Yoshi2	dashes in English isn't really a thing in the same way it is in German, I think
2016-06-17 12:18:01	Marty2000	Yes, I know what it is in German. I couldn't explain, but I know why you use them
2016-06-17 12:18:05	Marty2000	:p
2016-06-17 12:18:14	Yoshi2	I forgot why we use them too
2016-06-17 12:18:31	Yoshi2	I think it is to show a stronger binding between words or something like that
2016-06-17 12:18:45	Yoshi2	in English you don't write words together so I'll just leave the dash out
2016-06-17 12:18:55	Marty2000	Yes
2016-06-17 12:18:56	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-17 12:19:42	Yoshi2	I also love how you have the rule of keeping the original capitalization, but in some cases you just swap around the capitalization
2016-06-17 12:19:43	Yoshi2	 	Generat. positroni 	Positron generator 	
2016-06-17 12:20:14	Marty2000	Hmm, by the way, those names were gathered from the final results screen
2016-06-17 12:20:24	Marty2000	They are very likely different in-game
2016-06-17 12:20:33	Marty2000	And I have to get them all :p
2016-06-17 12:21:40	Marty2000	Yes, that's what I thought...
2016-06-17 12:21:42	Marty2000	Look
2016-06-17 12:21:48	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Main_Engine
2016-06-17 12:21:58	Marty2000	"Hauptantrieb"
2016-06-17 12:22:06	Marty2000	It's the name on the final results screen
2016-06-17 12:22:11	Marty2000	In-game, the name is
2016-06-17 12:22:26	Marty2000	Hauptantrieb des Dolphins
2016-06-17 12:22:36	Marty2000	So I have to add it too
2016-06-17 12:22:44	Yoshi2	Main Propulsion of the Dolphin
2016-06-17 12:23:00	Marty2000	I see, thanks
2016-06-17 12:23:13	Marty2000	Do you want to add it or will you let me add it?
2016-06-17 12:23:21	Yoshi2	I'll let you add it
2016-06-17 12:23:29	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-17 12:24:06	Marty2000	By the way, I have a question... I guess it's "yes"... but do title cases exist in German?
2016-06-17 12:24:18	Marty2000	I want to know if they made a mistake in Pikmin or if it's normal in German
2016-06-17 12:24:25	Marty2000	I know you already capitalize every noun
2016-06-17 12:24:57	Marty2000	Wait... I'm stupid. With title caes, you capitalize every noun in English :p
2016-06-17 12:25:03	Marty2000	Ignore this

2016-06-17 15:36:38	Klemen702	both are named Stol
2016-06-17 15:36:46	Klemen702	which also can mean chair
2016-06-17 16:29:59	Chiaki_Nanami	Wow, the Serbians were pretty ruthless.
2016-06-17 16:30:27	Chiaki_Nanami	And also extremely butthurt about everything in general.
2016-06-17 16:36:15	Klemen702	the nationalists
2016-06-17 16:36:16	Klemen702	were
2016-06-17 16:43:19	Chiaki_Nanami	I haven't even watched everything yet (only the first two parts), but I think that Yugoslavia couldn't exist without Tito in control.
2016-06-17 16:47:19	Klemen702	i'd say it could have
2016-06-17 16:47:36	Klemen702	just that we shoudn't have had nationalists etc.
2016-06-17 16:47:53	Klemen702	people who actualy imported and exported shit in yugoslavia correctly

2016-06-17 17:18:05	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-06-17 17:39:00	Yoshi2	hey scruffy
2016-06-17 17:39:25	Scruffy	Hey everyone
2016-06-17 17:39:38	Scruffy	I've been looking through Pikmin 2 sound effects
2016-06-17 17:39:42	Scruffy	found some interesting tidbits
2016-06-17 17:40:07	Scruffy	The roar of the Empress Bulblax contains a slowed-down sample of a woman screaming
2016-06-17 17:40:37	Marty2000	Ah? Hah
2016-06-17 17:40:46	Scruffy	Also, the sound of a Candypop Bud wilting is just a modified version of the sound when Pikmin lose their flowers and revert to leaves
2016-06-17 17:41:01	Marty2000	Wow, cool
2016-06-17 17:45:12	Scruffy	None of the sounds for Bulbmin or the Waterwraith appear to be the pitch they are in the final game, so they must have some speed modifier
2016-06-17 17:45:56	Scruffy	And also it appears that the sound files contains some unused takes of Pikmin voices, that were never sped up
2016-06-17 17:46:32	Klemen702	what are they
2016-06-17 17:46:49	Scruffy	Just sounds like "oh," "waah," or "hi"
2016-06-17 17:46:53	Scruffy	Miscellany
2016-06-17 17:47:14	Scruffy	But they were muddy recordings, I can see why they re-recorded if these are unused takes
2016-06-17 17:47:36	Klemen702	muddy
2016-06-17 17:47:38	Klemen702	how?
2016-06-17 17:47:43	Klemen702	files can't have mud on them
2016-06-17 17:47:49	Klemen702	computer files
2016-06-17 17:47:52	Scruffy	Muddy in the music world means muffled
2016-06-17 17:48:19	Scruffy	Or too crowded with sounds that drown out the focused sound
2016-06-17 17:49:10	Klemen702	then say it's muffled
2016-06-17 17:49:20	Klemen702	but ok
2016-06-17 17:49:36	Scruffy	Sorry, I'm just used to the term; a lot of musicians use it when recording or listening
2016-06-17 17:49:47	Scruffy	Or at least, around here
2016-06-17 18:01:43	Scruffy	Here's something crazy
2016-06-17 18:01:55	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-06-17 18:01:56	Scruffy	The whistle that you hear when Gatling Groink shots are fired
2016-06-17 18:02:25	Scruffy	Is a modulating version of the same whistle in Super Mario Sunshine when Bullet Bills are fired
2016-06-17 18:02:43	Marty2000	I see
2016-06-17 18:03:10	Scruffy	It's the same sound sample, just modified with a little pitch wobble (modulation)
2016-06-17 18:04:45	Marty2000	You should add that to Pikipedia, that's very interesting ;)

2016-06-17 18:46:20	Marty2000	Hello Espyo and Testyo
2016-06-17 18:46:20	Testyo	navbox type and yeah, the download works
2016-06-17 18:47:54	@Espyo	hi
2016-06-17 18:48:18	Scruffy	Found some interesting Pikmin 2 sound effect trivia
2016-06-17 18:48:30	@Espyo	this oughta be good
2016-06-17 18:48:38	Scruffy	<Scruffy>: The roar of the Empress Bulblax contains a slowed-down sample of a woman screaming <Marty2000>: Ah? Hah <Scruffy>: Also, the sound of a Candypop Bud wilting is just a modified version of the sound when Pikmin lose their flowers and revert to leaves <Marty2000>: Wow, cool <Scruffy>: None of the sounds for Bulbmin or the Waterwraith appear to be the

2016-06-17 18:49:38	@Espyo	...wow
2016-06-17 18:49:41	@Espyo	this is all gold
2016-06-17 18:49:47	@Espyo	you have to add it to the wiki
2016-06-17 18:49:56	@Espyo	and!
2016-06-17 18:49:59	Scruffy	I already added the last bit
2016-06-17 18:50:02	@Espyo	you can probably make a video with all of your findings
2016-06-17 18:50:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-06-17 18:50:09	@Espyo	since saying something about sounds is not as good as showing them
2016-06-17 18:50:25	Scruffy	Yeah! Good idea
2016-06-17 19:00:14	Yoshi2	Espyo: I really got my hopes up earlier this morning about the panther<->panzer thing, but I was let down again because an admin only added some translation tags
2016-06-17 19:00:26	@Espyo	heh
2016-06-17 19:00:28	@Espyo	oh well
2016-06-17 19:00:32	@Espyo	best to just ignore it
2016-06-17 19:01:42	Yoshi2	my plan is as follows
2016-06-17 19:01:56	Yoshi2	1) make a battalion wars article and add stuff to it
2016-06-17 19:02:34	Yoshi2	2) yolo it and change panzer back to panther with a referenze to the talk page because clearly the admins don't care enough to write a "No" or a "Yes" on it
2016-06-17 19:03:55	Klemen702	i just relaised
2016-06-17 19:04:07	Klemen702	numbers can have 2 opposites
2016-06-17 19:04:12	Klemen702	for example 20..
2016-06-17 19:04:18	Klemen702	the opposite of 20 could be 40 or 10
2016-06-17 19:04:27	Yoshi2	Klemen702: what
2016-06-17 19:04:31	Yoshi2	define "opposites"
2016-06-17 19:05:07	Klemen702	that would take 1 million years of finding the right words
2016-06-17 19:05:14	Klemen702	and what i said earlier would also take 1 mill years
2016-06-17 19:05:20	Klemen702	so
2016-06-17 19:05:22	Klemen702	i can't do a thing
2016-06-17 19:05:41	Yoshi2	it would take less time than complaining about how much time it would take
2016-06-17 19:05:54	Klemen702	well
2016-06-17 19:06:35	Yoshi2	describe it or write it down in a language you know well
2016-06-17 19:07:29	Klemen702	opposite could be something.. that is in one sense or another completely different.. than a thing. but in this.. i literally have no idea how to explain. althrough all i did was :2 and x2
2016-06-17 19:08:57	Scruffy	Opposite is a difficult word to define. To me it would make sense that two opposites cancel each other out, which would make number inverses opposites
2016-06-17 19:09:05	Scruffy	such as 20 and -20
2016-06-17 19:09:09	Marty2000	The opposite of 20 is -20, isn't it? :p
2016-06-17 19:09:19	Klemen702	FAK
2016-06-17 19:09:21	Klemen702	i forgot
2016-06-17 19:09:22	Yoshi2	20 and -20 is really more fitting as the opposite
2016-06-17 19:09:22	Klemen702	that exists
2016-06-17 19:10:23	Marty2000	I guess you were talking about doubles and halves
2016-06-17 19:11:10	Klemen702	Da
2016-06-17 19:11:20	Yoshi2	did you know that the difference between x and 2*x is x
2016-06-17 19:14:54	Yoshi2	Espyo: the idea is that the BW article would make it so I'm less "that guy who complains about tanks", and changing the thing back would force admin interaction or in the best case they don't care and it is left like this
2016-06-17 19:18:28	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yeah, might as well
2016-06-17 19:18:58	Yoshi2	probably a weird hill to die on, but even in the very worst case I expect only a warning
2016-06-17 19:19:43	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-17 19:31:44	@Espyo	Marty2000: correct, other people's comments mustn't be edited unless by a staff member with good reason
2016-06-17 19:34:09	Marty2000	Okay
2016-06-17 19:34:17	Marty2000	I was going to ask you, I wasn't sure
2016-06-17 19:34:23	@Espyo	it's fine
2016-06-17 19:34:28	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_family&curid=1253&diff=167039&oldid=166416 hmm... is this true?
2016-06-17 19:35:15	Marty2000	Partially
2016-06-17 19:35:18	Marty2000	"having a group of at least less than twelve Pikmin of any color" is wrong
2016-06-17 19:35:21	Marty2000	It happens randomly
2016-06-17 19:35:37	Marty2000	And I also told you that leaders look at working Pikmin, fruits, and candypop buds sometimes ;)
2016-06-17 19:35:56	Scruffy	Yeah, Pikmin look at the Onion and the ship sometimes in Pikmin 2
2016-06-17 19:38:18	Marty2000	I didn't know for P2, that's cool :)
2016-06-17 19:38:57	@Espyo	yeah, but looking at the cursor is a bit different
2016-06-17 19:38:59	@Espyo	even implementation-wise
2016-06-17 19:39:39	Scruffy	Oooh, now trivia
2016-06-17 19:40:08	Scruffy	The noise Antenna Beetles make contains a modulated sample of actual crickets and cicadas
2016-06-17 19:40:26	Scruffy	Plus other sounds
2016-06-17 19:41:11	@Espyo	hehehehe, neat
2016-06-17 19:42:27	Scruffy	Alright, I'll definitely be making a video about all this
2016-06-17 19:42:51	@Espyo	you have to, at this point!
2016-06-17 19:42:57	@Espyo	but you better be sure you don't miss any
2016-06-17 19:43:05	@Espyo	otherwise you won't be able to redo the video...
2016-06-17 19:43:12	@Espyo	so, might as well keep a list, if you don't already have one
2016-06-17 19:43:25	@Espyo	oh, and add to the list the fact that Armored Cannon Larvae have a much longer death noise than what you hear in-game
2016-06-17 19:43:26	Scruffy	I've got a list going
2016-06-17 19:43:29	Scruffy	Right
2016-06-17 19:43:30	@Espyo	(without pausing)
2016-06-17 19:44:48	Scruffy	Also, a lot of sounds from /Pikmin/ are here that aren't used in Pikmin 2
2016-06-17 19:44:57	Scruffy	Such as the pikmin drowning sound
2016-06-17 19:45:02	Scruffy	And the Bulborb scream
2016-06-17 19:45:20	Scruffy	And the ping that the Dolphin makes!
2016-06-17 19:45:29	Scruffy	You only hear that in the opening cutscene of Pikmin 2
2016-06-17 19:47:50	Scruffy	Also I'm confused that Scene_0.aw doesn't contain all the sounds of Pikmin 2
2016-06-17 19:48:24	Scruffy	On TCRF you said the other 48 folders contain instrument sounds, plus Wine won't parse those correctly and can't dump the sounds
2016-06-17 19:48:33	Scruffy	So I'm wondering where the remaining sounds could be
2016-06-17 19:49:50	@Espyo	huh, weird
2016-06-17 19:49:56	@Espyo	how many do you have on Scene_0.aw?
2016-06-17 19:51:24	Scruffy	867
2016-06-17 19:51:45	@Espyo	 864 on my end...?
2016-06-17 19:52:08	@Espyo	well, but... yeah, I actually did check all of them
2016-06-17 19:52:15	Scruffy	One of them is really garbled...
2016-06-17 19:52:28	@Espyo	of course, I wouldn't have checked like 30 thousand of them in any time less than a year unless I sped things up
2016-06-17 19:52:40	@Espyo	so I mostly just did right arrow key, enter, right arrow key, enter, right arrow key, enter
2016-06-17 19:52:42	@Espyo	a bit quickly
2016-06-17 19:52:49	Scruffy	oh yeah
2016-06-17 19:52:56	@Espyo	but since most of them are instrument sounds, AND are the same instrument as the previous sound, but in a different pitch...
2016-06-17 19:53:09	@Espyo	it wasn't that hard to understand that these 20 last sounds I heard where a single instrument, without needing to hear all of it
2016-06-17 19:53:17	Scruffy	Hm
2016-06-17 19:53:27	Scruffy	I don't think I've heard more than 3 of the same instrument
2016-06-17 19:53:34	@Espyo	so yeah, even though I didn't hear them all in detail, I'm fairly sure I heard them all...
2016-06-17 19:53:43	@Espyo	I'm going off of memory
2016-06-17 19:53:49	@Espyo	probably 3, not 20, then :P
2016-06-17 19:53:53	Scruffy	Heh
2016-06-17 19:57:15	Scruffy	Oh, the sound of the pause menu coming up is sped up
2016-06-17 19:57:32	Scruffy	It sounds like someone recorded a drum and gourd shaker
2016-06-17 19:57:33	@Espyo	sped up in the game's files, or sped up in-game?
2016-06-17 19:57:41	Scruffy	sped up in-game
2016-06-17 19:57:51	@Espyo	hm, the opposite would make more sense
2016-06-17 19:57:59	Scruffy	That's the case with a lot of thes
2016-06-17 19:58:03	@Espyo	since it'd make  the in-game file smaller
2016-06-17 19:58:11	@Espyo	it could be that the exporter goofed up
2016-06-17 19:58:16	@Espyo	how sped up is it? is it noticeable?
2016-06-17 19:58:20	Scruffy	Yes
2016-06-17 19:58:21	@Espyo	if so, give me its ID
2016-06-17 19:58:23	@Espyo	so I can check here
2016-06-17 19:58:24	Scruffy	Almost half speed

2016-06-17 19:58:37	@Espyo	shouldn't be, but
2016-06-17 19:59:03	@Espyo	it sounds normal to me
2016-06-17 19:59:13	Scruffy	hmm
2016-06-17 19:59:17	@Espyo	has a bit of a maraca thing going on at the end, but otherwise, it's like how I remember in-game
2016-06-17 19:59:21	Scruffy	I just remember it lasting less time in game
2016-06-17 19:59:28	Scruffy	Maybe they just cut it short
2016-06-17 19:59:32	@Espyo	likely
2016-06-17 19:59:48	Scruffy	All of the Bulbmin sound bytes are double speed in game though
2016-06-17 20:00:02	@Espyo	that's believable
2016-06-17 20:01:03	@Espyo	they... also sound normal to me
2016-06-17 20:01:19	@Espyo	but then, I can barely remember their sounds
2016-06-17 20:01:24	@Espyo	not really the most popular Pikmin type, is it
2016-06-17 20:01:52	Scruffy	I'm still searching for it
2016-06-17 20:03:09	@Espyo	what, Bulbmin sounds?
2016-06-17 20:03:17	Scruffy	Found em
2016-06-17 20:03:17	@Espyo	circa 2bc
2016-06-17 20:04:27	Scruffy	yeah, these are definitely slowed down
2016-06-17 20:05:25	Scruffy	Try 2c6, the sound of them carrying
2016-06-17 20:05:37	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-06-17 20:05:40	@Espyo	that one's clear as hell
2016-06-17 20:05:47	@Espyo	you're right
2016-06-17 20:05:51	@Espyo	but it makes me wonder why...
2016-06-17 20:06:10	@Espyo	wait, do they have a different frequency from the others?
2016-06-17 20:06:32	Scruffy	It just seems that they're 100% slower than in-game
2016-06-17 20:06:40	@Espyo	they do!
2016-06-17 20:06:44	@Espyo	 22050Hz normally
2016-06-17 20:06:49	Scruffy	All Pikmin sounds are 100% sped up
2016-06-17 20:06:51	@Espyo	(at least 2b1, the Cloaking Burrow-nit spear sound)
2016-06-17 20:07:07	@Espyo	and these Bulbmin sounds are 5666Hz
2016-06-17 20:07:36	Scruffy	So it could be that someone recorded Bulbmin with their voice, afterwards putting a filter on it
2016-06-17 20:07:45	@Espyo	yeah
2016-06-17 20:07:52	@Espyo	and then made the engine play it back at normal speed
2016-06-17 20:07:55	@Espyo	which is needlessly complicated
2016-06-17 20:07:55	Scruffy	But they didn't speed it up because they wanted to experiment with the final sound, how high it is
2016-06-17 20:08:03	@Espyo	oh, good point
2016-06-17 20:08:04	Scruffy	Perhaps
2016-06-17 20:08:04	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-06-17 20:09:16	Scruffy	The same thing happens with the Waterwraith, best example is 2d7
2016-06-17 20:09:40	Scruffy	100% sped up, it sounds like the Waterwraith in-game
2016-06-17 20:09:41	@Espyo	...
2016-06-17 20:09:48	@Espyo	my dogs are literally making Waterwraith-like sounds outside
2016-06-17 20:10:01	@Espyo	oh yeah, definitely slowed down
2016-06-17 20:10:38	Scruffy	Except not all of them...???
2016-06-17 20:10:52	@Espyo	check the frequency of the non-slowed-down ones
2016-06-17 20:10:54	Scruffy	2dd and 2de are normal
2016-06-17 20:11:18	@Espyo	 5666Hz versus 15616Hz
2016-06-17 20:12:39	@Espyo	yeah, if I play it back under 11025Hz, it sounds like in-game
2016-06-17 20:13:04	@Espyo	so, could it be that sounds in 5666Hz frequency are told to be played at double-speed in-game?
2016-06-17 20:13:23	Scruffy	How are you checking the frequency?
2016-06-17 20:13:27	@Espyo	or maybe, they ARE recorded at 11025Hz, and the tool that extracts them did it wrong
2016-06-17 20:13:33	@Espyo	well, I'm using Winamp
2016-06-17 20:13:37	@Espyo	but other than that, Audacity
2016-06-17 20:13:43	@Espyo	I imported to Audacity, told me right away
2016-06-17 20:13:47	@Espyo	(bottom left and bottom right corners)
2016-06-17 20:13:50	@Espyo	and I also changed it in there
2016-06-17 20:14:34	Scruffy	Ah I see
2016-06-17 20:15:43	Scruffy	So that's sampling rate
2016-06-17 20:17:16	Scruffy	Yeah, that'd make sense if one sample rate were designated to be sped up
2016-06-17 20:17:31	Scruffy	Ha!
2016-06-17 20:17:45	Scruffy	That's also the sample rate of unused Pikmin vocal takes that were never sped up
2016-06-17 20:17:54	@Espyo	ooh!
2016-06-17 20:17:58	@Espyo	well, there we have it
2016-06-17 20:17:58	Scruffy	Which implies they were meant to be Pikmin sounds
2016-06-17 20:18:05	@Espyo	but, what IS the correct frequency to play them at?
2016-06-17 20:18:06	Scruffy	But never sounded Pikminy enough
2016-06-17 20:18:33	Scruffy	Well that number isn't frequency of sound, it's frequency of audio samples carried per second
2016-06-17 20:18:34	@Espyo	double, 15616Hz (like most other sounds), or 11025Hz (a recommended frequency by Audacity, from the list
2016-06-17 20:18:35	@Espyo	*)
2016-06-17 20:18:49	@Espyo	well, yeah
2016-06-17 20:18:58	Scruffy	So I'm not sure
2016-06-17 20:21:32	Scruffy	Some are 22000 as well

2016-06-17 20:23:35	Yoshi2	what format are the sounds in?
2016-06-17 20:24:10	Yoshi2	DSP-ADPCM has the frequency in the header
2016-06-17 20:27:24	Scruffy	I'm not sure how they organize sample frequency
2016-06-17 20:27:37	@Espyo	well, they're a proprietary format
2016-06-17 20:27:49	@Espyo	but the format the tool converts it to is .ogg
2016-06-17 20:27:52	@Espyo	hm, actually
2016-06-17 20:27:58	Scruffy	Most of the sounds returning from /pikmin/ appear to be 32,000 Hz
2016-06-17 20:28:00	Yoshi2	a lot of stuff is in proprietary format on GC
2016-06-17 20:28:00	@Espyo	or .wav?
2016-06-17 20:28:04	Scruffy	.wav
2016-06-17 20:28:07	@Espyo	right
2016-06-17 20:28:07	Scruffy	for me, at least
2016-06-17 20:28:13	@Espyo	yeah, the .ogg I have come from J
2016-06-17 20:28:23	@Espyo	so many years back, he converted the sounds from .wav to .ogg because, duh, smaller
2016-06-17 20:28:26	@Espyo	and shared those with me
2016-06-17 20:28:35	@Espyo	or I since lost that, and these are some new ones I converted to ogg
2016-06-17 20:28:46	Yoshi2	Well Done J
2016-06-17 20:29:42	Yoshi2	Espyo: are you using wwdumpsnd?
2016-06-17 20:30:00	@Espyo	that's just it, I can't remember where I got these from
2016-06-17 20:30:05	@Espyo	since I've had this folder for the past 5 years now
2016-06-17 20:30:06	@Espyo	or so
2016-06-17 20:30:18	Scruffy	I've tried resampling them on Audacity
2016-06-17 20:32:22	Yoshi2	ok, seems that format probably makes less sense than dsp-adpcm
2016-06-17 20:32:47	Scruffy	22,050 sounds more like in-game, for the Bulbmin clips anyway
2016-06-17 20:33:49	@Espyo	huh
2016-06-17 20:33:50	@Espyo	that's a lot
2016-06-17 20:33:52	Yoshi2	the tool does try to read the samplerate from the file, though it might give up in some cases and just set the rate to 32k
2016-06-17 20:33:52	Testyo	32 K = -241.15 °C / -402.07 °F
2016-06-17 20:35:50	@Espyo	hmm
2016-06-17 20:35:55	Scruffy	22050 is the sample for 0a at lesat
2016-06-17 20:35:58	@Espyo	don't think I've found any 32k one though
2016-06-17 20:35:58	Testyo	32 K = -241.15 °C / -402.07 °F
2016-06-17 20:36:24	Scruffy	a6 is 32k
2016-06-17 20:36:24	Testyo	32 K = -241.15 °C / -402.07 °F
2016-06-17 20:38:32	Yoshi2	one thing I don't get is why wwdumpsnd does this: srate=((buf[1]<<8)|buf[2])/2
2016-06-17 20:39:04	Yoshi2	that halves whatever rate value it finds
2016-06-17 20:39:48	Yoshi2	or in terms of bits, shifts the entire value one bit to the right
2016-06-17 20:41:26	@Espyo	maybe the bitrate is saved as 7-bit
2016-06-17 20:41:31	@Espyo	and one bit is used for...who knows what?
2016-06-17 20:41:43	Yoshi2	maybe

2016-06-17 20:51:26	Scruffy	Ugh, now I realize these are supposed to go in a logical order, but my Mac doesn't arrange file names by byte, instead by alphabet and then numbers

2016-06-17 20:57:53	@Espyo	right
2016-06-17 20:58:38	Scruffy	Also the Groink whistling sound and the sound of enemy ghosts flying up are two drones that are pitch modulated in-game

2016-06-17 20:58:49	@Espyo	ooh
2016-06-17 20:59:40	Scruffy	Probably because their pitch depends on the distance the pellets fly/the size of the ghost appearing
2016-06-17 21:00:07	@Espyo	hm, I'd imagine so
2016-06-17 21:03:56	Scruffy	hmmm, 12e

2016-06-17 23:07:24	Marty2000	Anyway, it's a really great piece of art, I mean, Paper Olimar would fit perfectly in a Paper Mario, for example

2016-06-17 23:30:39	Marty2000	Let's continue with crazyness. I already said that in French, title cases didn't exist. They used them for P1 and P2 (only in the European version), but they stopped in P3. Spanish does not have title cases... so they don't use them in P2. However, they do in Pikmin 3... that's quite strange and hard to understand...

2016-06-18 01:15:08	Marty2000	Guess what
2016-06-18 01:15:29	Marty2000	I managed to hack my gears in Splatoon
2016-06-18 01:15:40	@PikFan	hack?
2016-06-18 01:15:45	@PikFan	gears?
2016-06-18 01:15:48	@PikFan	oh
2016-06-18 01:15:52	@PikFan	gear, okay
2016-06-18 01:15:55	@PikFan	but hack? how?
2016-06-18 01:16:11	Marty2000	Well, it's not really hack, since you don't even have to modify your Wii U
2016-06-18 01:16:17	Marty2000	(you just need Internet)
2016-06-18 01:16:25	@PikFan	hm
2016-06-18 01:16:31	@PikFan	how'd you do it?
2016-06-18 01:16:39	Marty2000	I can tell you if you want
2016-06-18 01:17:05	@PikFan	yes please
2016-06-18 01:17:08	Marty2000	I'll explain you, just let me find the download link
2016-06-18 01:17:39	Marty2000	https://www.dropbox.com/s/7y7fn8be3wn84jl/Splathax.exe?dl=0
2016-06-18 01:17:42	Marty2000	So...
2016-06-18 01:17:51	Marty2000	Turn your Wii U on
2016-06-18 01:17:58	Marty2000	Go on the Internet Browser
2016-06-18 01:18:06	Marty2000	Write "www.loadiine.ovh"
2016-06-18 01:18:18	Marty2000	Then, select
2016-06-18 01:18:38	Marty2000	TCPGecko+Kernel
2016-06-18 01:19:02	Marty2000	Your Wii U will redirect you to the pause screen (where you can see your friend list and such things)
2016-06-18 01:19:19	@PikFan	you sure we won't be banned or anything like that?
2016-06-18 01:19:25	@PikFan	I don't want to lose all my progress...
2016-06-18 01:19:31	Marty2000	Go on the Internet Browser again, and type "www.loadiine.ovh" again
2016-06-18 01:19:56	Marty2000	Oh, no, you cannot be banned if you use those... it's only for things like infinite bubbler / infinite range, etc
2016-06-18 01:20:10	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2016-06-18 01:20:14	Marty2000	So, after typing the url again, your Wii U will redirect you to the Home menu again
2016-06-18 01:20:25	Marty2000	From here, launch Splatoon
2016-06-18 01:20:46	Marty2000	Then, watch the news, and wait on the plaza (always)
2016-06-18 01:20:57	Marty2000	Now, download the software
2016-06-18 01:21:16	Marty2000	And write your Wii U's IP on the top left
2016-06-18 01:21:24	Marty2000	Then, click on "Connect"
2016-06-18 01:21:31	Marty2000	And you will see every gear you own
2016-06-18 01:21:48	Marty2000	From here, you can modify and choose "level up gear" afterwards
2016-06-18 01:22:29	Marty2000	Once you've finished, before exiting the software on your computer, go on the "equip" screen in Splatoon 'by pressing +)
2016-06-18 01:22:46	Marty2000	Then, get back to the Plaza (this will save everything)
2016-06-18 01:23:04	Marty2000	Then, exit the software on your computer, turn off your Wii U, and you can turn it on and play normally
2016-06-18 01:23:30	Marty2000	I have tried some funny things
2016-06-18 01:23:52	Marty2000	Like... 12 Special Savers (you have your Inkstrike ready even after dying :p )
2016-06-18 01:24:21	@PikFan	how do you know what your Wii U's IP is?

2016-06-18 01:40:17	Marty2000	Cool

2016-06-18 01:40:22	@PikFan	okay, so I loaded loadiine.ovh twice
2016-06-18 01:40:30	@PikFan	NOW do I open Splatoon? :P

2016-06-18 01:40:33	Marty2000	Yes :p
2016-06-18 01:40:37	@PikFan	alrighty
2016-06-18 01:40:39	@PikFan	here we go
2016-06-18 01:40:54	Marty2000	And don't start modifying until your Inkling can move on the plaza (and stay on the plaza)
2016-06-18 01:41:02	Marty2000	It should work this time
2016-06-18 01:41:03	@PikFan	yes
2016-06-18 01:41:54	UltraMario	Scruffy: reminds me of the april fools pikipedia
2016-06-18 01:41:54	@PikFan	okay, I can move around
2016-06-18 01:42:04	Marty2000	Okay, now you can start modifying on your computer
2016-06-18 01:42:11	Marty2000	Leave your Inkling take a breath alone :p
2016-06-18 01:42:47	Scruffy	UltraMario: Yep, that's the idea, it's a trailer for that
2016-06-18 01:42:48	Marty2000	So, you need to enter what your Wii U's Ip on the top left corner
2016-06-18 01:42:59	@PikFan	Norton's blocking it :|
2016-06-18 01:43:06	Marty2000	AH... :/
2016-06-18 01:43:08	Scruffy	More specifically I'm making it like I'm a Nintendo representative presenting it at E3
2016-06-18 01:43:23	Marty2000	Well, I think I can modify by myself your own gear
2016-06-18 01:43:35	Marty2000	But you need to tell me your IP (private message if you want)
2016-06-18 01:43:48	Marty2000	Scruffy: I'm sure that'll be fun! I can't wait to see it!
2016-06-18 01:44:23	-->	Miles_ (Miles@694-146-608-45.res.bhn.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-06-18 01:44:30	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-06-18 01:44:55	@PikFan	oh, I connected it
2016-06-18 01:45:00	Marty2000	Cool
2016-06-18 01:45:02	@PikFan	I managed to override Norton
2016-06-18 01:45:16	@PikFan	yes!!!!!
2016-06-18 01:45:20	@PikFan	now the fun begins
2016-06-18 01:45:24	Marty2000	So, you can see every piece of clothing now
2016-06-18 01:45:43	Marty2000	To modify the abilities, choose a piece of clothing
2016-06-18 01:45:50	Marty2000	(click on it)
2016-06-18 01:46:08	@PikFan	I already edited my legendary cap :P
2016-06-18 01:46:15	Marty2000	On the top "Set ability", choose the abiltity you want to set
2016-06-18 01:46:18	@PikFan	how do I save it?
2016-06-18 01:46:27	Marty2000	"Level Gear"

2016-06-18 01:49:04	Marty2000	Well, I'll tell you: once you've finished modifying: close the software on your computer
2016-06-18 01:49:18	Marty2000	Go back to Splatoon, press +, and confirm everything has been modified
2016-06-18 01:49:26	@PikFan	okay
2016-06-18 01:49:42	@PikFan	it... worked
2016-06-18 01:49:46	Marty2000	If everything has been modified, you can go back to the plaza, and turn off your Wii U (this is important)
2016-06-18 01:50:08	Marty2000	Going back to the plaza will save, and turning off your Wii U will cancel any risk
2016-06-18 01:50:23	Marty2000	Then, you can turn on your Wii U and freely play ;)
2016-06-18 01:50:57	Marty2000	Heh, that was easy, wasn't it? You don't even need to modify the console, that's great
2016-06-18 01:51:01	@PikFan	now I have 12 Damage Ups :D
2016-06-18 01:51:04	Marty2000	:D
2016-06-18 01:51:27	@PikFan	alright, I'm gonna put my Wii U's IP somewhere safe
2016-06-18 01:53:21	@PikFan	alright, time to cause some chaos
2016-06-18 01:53:26	Marty2000	Hah

2016-06-18 01:53:35	Marty2000	....with 12 Special Duration Ups :D
2016-06-18 01:53:38	@PikFan	I'm gonna see how powerful 12 damage ups are

2016-06-18 01:58:17	Marty2000	I guess it's quite easier to splat with 12 Special Damage Ups when the enemy is in your own ink
2016-06-18 02:02:50	@PikFan	changing weapon
2016-06-18 02:02:53	Marty2000	Okay

2016-06-18 03:07:06	Scruffy	It looks just like the Paper Mario series

2016-06-18 03:23:27	Scruffy	Here's the original character PikFan: http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/9/93/Paper_Olimar_by_Scruffy.png
2016-06-18 03:23:42	Scruffy	The gif wasn't as detailed as I expected
2016-06-18 03:23:48	@PikFan	yeah, I saw it earlier
2016-06-18 03:24:15	@PikFan	I know, the gif seemed kinda low quality to me too
2016-06-18 03:24:48	Scruffy	It's just because GIMP wouldn't load for me to create a gif myself, so I had to go online
2016-06-18 03:24:59	@PikFan	I see
2016-06-18 03:25:01	@PikFan	well, that sucks
2016-06-18 03:25:12	Scruffy	It's alright, I think I just need to update
