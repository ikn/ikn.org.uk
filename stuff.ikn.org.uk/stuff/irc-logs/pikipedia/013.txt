2015-03-30 22:22:08	@Espyo	can't decide between 2 and 3
2015-03-30 22:22:13	@Espyo	but I'd probably go with 2
2015-03-30 22:23:51	@J	yeah, I started with 2, thought the red wasn't very readable so did 1, then thought it looked odd with one bold and one not so did 3
2015-03-30 22:24:02	@J	but I'm not sure if 3 is unnecessarily bold
2015-03-30 22:24:15	@J	if you think 2's perfectly readable I'll use that

2015-03-31 20:29:10	@Espyo	that word stopped existing
2015-03-31 20:29:14	@Espyo	means lampshade
2015-03-31 20:29:17	@Espyo	or at least it SHOULD
2015-03-31 20:29:29	@PikFan	what does it mean now
2015-03-31 20:29:32	@PikFan	if anything
2015-03-31 20:30:25	@Espyo	it's just gone

2015-03-31 20:30:35	@Espyo	okay, so in Portuguese, we don't have a word for lampshade

2015-03-31 20:30:44	@PikFan	no
2015-03-31 20:30:44	@Espyo	so we just steal the French "abajeur"

2015-03-31 20:30:52	@Espyo	...but apparently that word stopped being French
2015-03-31 20:30:55	@Espyo	and is now just ours?

2015-03-31 20:43:41	@J	hmm, or maybe 10
2015-03-31 20:43:52	@J	it's crazy how long ago that was now

2015-03-31 21:04:26	@J	I had thought about it, then thought it probably wouldn't help because it would only be temporary data

2015-04-02 20:25:23	@PikFan	also bring back Blue Pikmin saving drowning Pikmin and more camera control
2015-04-02 20:25:31	Yoshi2	what does?
2015-04-02 20:25:50	@PikFan	I got used to the fixed camera, but it'd be nice to zoom out or change the angle
2015-04-02 20:26:39	@PikFan	also add swarming as an alternative to charging
2015-04-02 20:27:26	@Espyo	charging has pros and cons
2015-04-02 20:27:37	@Espyo	I, for one, love how the Pikmin actually DO go for the gate when I tell them to
2015-04-02 20:27:45	@Espyo	instead of having that little bastard that keeps pretending there's no spot for him
2015-04-02 20:27:57	@Espyo	until he finally finds one after I use the C-stick with him for 10 seconds
2015-04-02 20:28:27	@PikFan	...that seems like something that'd happen in P1
2015-04-02 20:28:57	@Espyo	you kidding?
2015-04-02 20:29:04	@Espyo	it happens at least 4 out of every 5 gates in P1 and P2

2015-04-02 20:29:11	@Espyo	they all go
2015-04-02 20:29:19	@Espyo	but one or two Pikmin keep failing to find a spot to attack the gate on

2015-04-02 20:36:21	@Espyo	I mean, with the C-stick, you have the ability to move around obstacles and such
2015-04-02 20:36:43	@Espyo	but with charging, you can attack from a distance, and with a single button, instead of creating an awkward "whip" of Pikmin and flailing them back and forth

2015-04-02 20:41:49	@PikFan	right
2015-04-02 20:42:17	@PikFan	time should pass underground, too
2015-04-02 20:42:38	@PikFan	but slower

2015-04-02 20:43:56	@PikFan	in that sense caves would be like dungeons in Zelda

2015-04-02 20:44:23	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-02 20:48:43	@J	time stopping in caves is to avoid coming up with a solution to what happens if it becomes night while you're underground
2015-04-02 20:48:56	@J	or what happens if you spend a whole night underground, even

2015-04-02 20:50:44	@J	anyway, as far as I'm concerned, the only reason for caves was to add much harder parts of the game (in terms of battles) while allowing you to save frequently
2015-04-02 20:51:23	@J	well, I guess I'm now aware of Autism Awareness Day
2015-04-02 20:51:47	@Espyo	what J said
2015-04-02 20:51:59	@Espyo	there should be an Autism Awareness Day Awareness Day
2015-04-02 20:52:04	@Espyo	because apparently not many people are aware
2015-04-02 20:55:01	@PikFan	yeah

2015-04-03 14:39:02	@Espyo	I think it's more related to the filesystem than anything
2015-04-03 14:39:17	@J	possibly, but it shouldn't make the UI freeze
2015-04-03 14:39:58	@J	perhaps I should do these tests on a filesystem large enough that I'm not suddenly using up 20% more of the total number of allowed files

2015-04-03 20:17:34	@PikFan	the second set of ujadani I killed gave over 80 bitter sprays alone

2015-04-03 20:20:29	@PikFan	...but since they're technically an obstacle, I don't think we can find out
2015-04-03 20:20:46	@PikFan	well, there's always taking a screenshot, but that'd be pretty moot
2015-04-03 20:28:23	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2015-04-03 20:33:21	@PikFan	hi
2015-04-03 20:36:07	@PikFan	odd
2015-04-03 20:36:30	@PikFan	I'd be in the middle of a discussion about now
2015-04-03 20:36:39	@PikFan	put people are gone
2015-04-03 20:36:51	@PikFan	it's strangely quiet here
2015-04-03 20:38:40	Yoshi2	230 bitter sprays sounds like a lot
2015-04-03 20:38:54	Yoshi2	on the other hand though, day 571
2015-04-03 20:39:04	Yoshi2	that means you had a lot of time to farm the sprays
2015-04-03 20:39:24	@PikFan	actually that was 230 sprays total
2015-04-03 20:39:31	@PikFan	spicy and bitter combined
2015-04-03 20:40:02	@PikFan	but I have 1200 bitter sprays and 2000 spicy sprays
2015-04-03 20:40:28	@PikFan	those 230 sprays were just from day 571
2015-04-03 20:40:36	Yoshi2	oh
2015-04-03 20:40:43	Yoshi2	are they that easy to farm?
2015-04-03 20:40:53	@PikFan	surprisingly, yes
2015-04-03 20:41:21	@PikFan	if you want to farm spicies, just go to Cavern of Chaos sublevel 5 over and over again
2015-04-03 20:41:55	@PikFan	two Iridescent Flint Beetles
2015-04-03 20:42:01	@PikFan	easy 4 sprays
2015-04-03 20:42:40	@PikFan	and since the CoC is so close
2015-04-03 20:42:47	@PikFan	to the landing site
2015-04-03 20:43:01	@PikFan	(enter curses me here too?!)
2015-04-03 20:43:18	@PikFan	it's really easy to farm spicies
2015-04-03 20:43:58	Yoshi2	I see
2015-04-03 20:44:53	Yoshi2	I'd say spicy spray farming is much more difficult in Pikmin 3
2015-04-03 20:45:10	@PikFan	yeah
2015-04-03 20:45:29	@PikFan	but you can leave Pikmin at the burgeoning spiderwort
2015-04-03 20:45:42	@PikFan	they'll go back to it automatically
2015-04-03 20:46:03	@PikFan	so you don't have to constantly manage that

2015-04-03 22:23:05	@J	the thing where you click it, then click a UI element to get information about it
2015-04-03 22:24:02	@J	I'm thinking if I put it in the status bar it might not be obvious enough, but put it at the top and it'll move one column down and not the other, so they won't be aligned very well

2015-04-03 22:26:12	@Espyo	hm
2015-04-03 22:26:24	@Espyo	status bar isn't really standard
2015-04-03 22:26:27	@Espyo	not on windows, anyway
2015-04-03 22:26:34	@Espyo	title bar is common
2015-04-03 22:26:42	@J	yeah, I know, it's normally in a toolbar at the top
2015-04-03 22:26:45	@Espyo	and toolbar
2015-04-03 22:26:46	@Espyo	yep
2015-04-03 22:26:49	@J	title bar, really?
2015-04-03 22:26:53	@J	I've never seen that
2015-04-03 22:26:59	@Espyo	mostly in older programs
2015-04-03 22:27:03	@Espyo	instead of just close, max, min
2015-04-03 22:27:06	@Espyo	you have close, max, min, help
2015-04-03 22:27:08	@J	well, I can't do that anyway
2015-04-03 22:27:12	@J	I don't even have title bars
2015-04-03 22:27:20	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-03 22:27:31	@Espyo	I think the status bar is your only choice
2015-04-03 22:27:33	@Espyo	bottom-right
2015-04-03 22:27:33	@J	but yeah, I don't have anything else to put in a toolbar
2015-04-03 22:27:46	@Espyo	I've seen programs that have a toolbar JUST for the help button
2015-04-03 22:27:49	@J	oh, give me a minute to take another screenshot

2015-04-03 22:29:49	@J	(bye)
2015-04-03 22:30:15	@Espyo	wait, maybe on the same column as the tabs
2015-04-03 22:30:25	@Espyo	aligned to the bottom with the text box
2015-04-03 22:30:37	@Espyo	it's just a 32x32 or so button, so it fits there nicely
2015-04-03 22:30:45	@J	I thought about that
2015-04-03 22:30:50	@Espyo	probably not very intuitive
2015-04-03 22:30:58	@J	2 problems
2015-04-03 22:31:17	@J	1. probably hacky to actually do it, since it'll be part of the actual tab bar
2015-04-03 22:31:27	@J	2. in future there'll be an arbitrary number of tabs
2015-04-03 22:32:02	@Espyo	rght
2015-04-03 22:32:03	@Espyo	*right
2015-04-03 22:32:03	@J	I'll have a look though, see if I can somehow split the tab bar into multiple widgets
2015-04-03 22:32:29	@J	then if there are lots of tabs and you have a scrolling thing, that wouldn't be outside of the ? button
2015-04-03 22:34:27	@J	it'll probably be possible, but that corner might start looking a bit busy if there are more tabs
2015-04-03 22:34:39	@J	maybe at the left of the status bar, before the text
2015-04-03 22:37:52	@Espyo	yeah, I thought to the left of the status bar too
2015-04-03 22:37:55	@Espyo	but it seems a bit weird
2015-04-03 22:38:03	@Espyo	but then again the status bar is for info
2015-04-03 22:38:05	@Espyo	and so is the help button

2015-04-04 12:07:36	@PikFan	so I'm watching the lunar eclipse right now
2015-04-04 12:08:14	@PikFan	...so weird to see the moon being eaten away by earth's shadow
2015-04-04 12:08:20	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2015-04-04 12:08:23	Yoshi2	lucky you
2015-04-04 12:08:40	Yoshi2	when the lunar eclipse happened here, it was too cloudy to see anything
2015-04-04 12:08:51	@PikFan	that sucks :(
2015-04-04 12:09:03	@PikFan	they do have livestreams

2015-04-04 12:14:03	@PikFan	ok so
2015-04-04 12:14:36	@PikFan	the ujadanj alone gave 93 spicies and 120 bitters
2015-04-04 12:14:58	@PikFan	...I think the game saw I had more spicy than bitter :|
2015-04-04 12:15:31	@PikFan	total, I got 135 spicy and 137 bitter
2015-04-04 12:15:57	@Espyo	nice
2015-04-04 12:15:58	@PikFan	...did I say 230 earlier? I must've lumped those numbers together
2015-04-04 12:16:13	@Espyo	add it to the wiki
2015-04-04 12:16:21	@Espyo	but can you be sure that those numbers are always the same?
2015-04-04 12:16:46	@PikFan	I did get more the second time
2015-04-04 12:16:57	@PikFan	since I was able to get rid of the nectar
2015-04-04 12:17:12	@Espyo	right, getting rid of the nectar is the important part

2015-04-04 12:19:57	@PikFan	no

2015-04-04 12:20:29	@Espyo	if you could gather some more numbers
2015-04-04 12:20:31	@Espyo	we could estimate
2015-04-04 12:21:01	@PikFan	couldn't you go into Dolphin and do that, though?
2015-04-04 12:21:24	@Espyo	...I'd finish a day of farming after 30 real-life hours

2015-04-04 12:22:13	@Espyo	plus, playing it with a keyboard...
2015-04-04 12:22:37	@PikFan	but think of it like the engine
2015-04-04 12:22:41	@PikFan	only 3D
2015-04-04 12:22:56	@Espyo	but
2015-04-04 12:23:01	@Espyo	you already farm anyway
2015-04-04 12:23:07	@PikFan	true
2015-04-04 12:23:21	@PikFan	still have to wait 30 days
2015-04-04 12:24:04	@PikFan	do you want all the numbers I have now? I have more
2015-04-04 12:24:09	Yoshi2	which pikin game are you doing?

2015-04-04 12:24:25	@PikFan	amazing
2015-04-04 12:24:56	@Espyo	right, I think we'd need the total of nothings, the total of nectars, total of spicies, and total of bitters
2015-04-04 12:24:56	@PikFan	(also I'm tired, so I'm sorry if I come off as rude, btw)
2015-04-04 12:25:01	@Espyo	heh, it's fine
2015-04-04 12:25:11	@PikFan	I see
2015-04-04 12:25:13	@Espyo	stupid game
2015-04-04 12:25:20	@Espyo	it has the distribution chances for eggs RIGHT THERE
2015-04-04 12:25:27	@Espyo	but ujadani and petrified enemies are hidden elsewhere
2015-04-04 12:25:33	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaaaah
2015-04-04 12:25:46	@PikFan	why why why why WHY does P2 have to be so COMPLEX
2015-04-04 12:26:00	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-04 12:26:19	@PikFan	hopefully P3 won't be as bad
2015-04-04 12:26:39	Yoshi2	ah, you're playing pikmin 2
2015-04-04 12:26:41	@Espyo	only Miles would know that
2015-04-04 12:26:52	Yoshi2	maybe I will pick it up again
2015-04-04 12:27:01	@PikFan	anyway, I noticed that it was 1/3 nectar, 1/3 spicy, 1/3 bitter
2015-04-04 12:27:16	@PikFan	...Miles has access to P3 files?
2015-04-04 12:27:22	@PikFan	err
2015-04-04 12:27:25	@PikFan	nevermind
2015-04-04 12:27:58	Yoshi2	I'm definitely looking forward to whatever will be discovered in the Wii U games
2015-04-04 12:28:04	@Espyo	can the ujadani drop nothing?
2015-04-04 12:28:10	@PikFan	yes
2015-04-04 12:28:33	@Espyo	then it can't be 1/3 nectar, 1/3 spicy, 1/3 bitter
2015-04-04 12:28:47	@PikFan	out of what did drop, I mean
2015-04-04 12:28:57	@Espyo	hm
2015-04-04 12:29:49	@PikFan	...why does the eclipse have to start to late
2015-04-04 12:29:55	@PikFan	4:29 here
2015-04-04 12:30:10	@PikFan	totality doesn't start till 4:58 or something
2015-04-04 12:30:14	@Espyo	either I'm dumb
2015-04-04 12:30:18	@Espyo	or there shouldn't be an eclipse

2015-04-04 12:56:05	@Espyo	so they just ate this thing
2015-04-04 12:56:11	@PikFan	ツ that's tsu
2015-04-04 12:56:12	@Espyo	that made them follow some folklore legend

2015-04-04 12:56:29	@Espyo	of two best friends that were so good at communicating, that they could go on entire conversations using just "tsu" and "ka"
2015-04-04 12:56:43	@Espyo	so in the episode, the characters started going "tsu" and "ka" for everything
2015-04-04 12:56:51	@Espyo	and they just talked like that, more effectively
2015-04-04 12:56:53	@Espyo	that's the vague memory I have
2015-04-04 12:57:09	@Espyo	but ever since then I could never find any evidence of tsu and ka being anything related to Japanese folklore
2015-04-04 12:57:11	@Espyo	and I'm flipping out
2015-04-04 12:57:22	@Espyo	and now you used it pretty similarly
2015-04-04 12:57:25	@PikFan	heh
2015-04-04 12:57:49	@PikFan	oh, I just said tsu because of the katakana that was there
2015-04-04 12:57:58	@Espyo	oh :/

2015-04-04 13:34:13	@Espyo	are they?
2015-04-04 13:34:53	@PikFan	yeah
2015-04-04 13:35:39	@PikFan	if you have a spray blob and nectar blob in the same exact spot
2015-04-04 13:35:56	@PikFan	you can tell the spray blob is bigger
2015-04-04 13:35:58	@Espyo	add it to the wiki, then
2015-04-04 13:36:21	@PikFan	because the spray blob will cover the nectar blob
2015-04-04 13:36:35	@Espyo	not necessarily conclusive
2015-04-04 13:36:41	@Espyo	if they're in the EXACT same spot
2015-04-04 13:36:43	@Espyo	and they have the same size
2015-04-04 13:36:52	@Espyo	one of them should cover up the other
2015-04-04 13:37:02	@Espyo	order probably depends on the order the game processes the objects
2015-04-04 13:37:15	@Espyo	there SHOULD be z-fighting, but I haven't noticed any Z-fighting in any Pikmin game
2015-04-04 13:37:21	@Espyo	or at least not Pikmin 2
2015-04-04 13:37:47	@PikFan	either I'm crazy or the spray looks a tiny bit bigger
2015-04-04 13:38:00	@Espyo	it could be
2015-04-04 13:38:04	@Espyo	do you still have them?
2015-04-04 13:38:11	@Espyo	try touching them with a leader, so that they wobble
2015-04-04 13:38:22	@Espyo	see if that helps you reach a conclusion
2015-04-04 13:38:26	@PikFan	I don't but I can reproduce it
2015-04-04 13:38:37	@Espyo	you can?
2015-04-04 13:39:36	@PikFan	Iridescent Flint Beetle
2015-04-04 13:39:51	@Espyo	still don't see how
2015-04-04 13:40:14	@PikFan	the first time you hit it, it releases a nectar blob
2015-04-04 13:40:32	@PikFan	hit it again, it releases two more nectar blobs
2015-04-04 13:40:42	@PikFan	third time releases a spray blob
2015-04-04 13:41:01	@PikFan	the spray blob lands in the EXACT same spot as the first nectar blob
2015-04-04 13:41:31	@Espyo	oh, you mean if you hit the IFB so that it doesn't move?
2015-04-04 13:41:41	@PikFan	yeah
2015-04-04 13:41:50	@Espyo	neat
2015-04-04 13:41:59	@Espyo	we should have that on the wiki, the not-moving thing
2015-04-04 13:42:14	@PikFan	you have to hit it in rapid succession though
2015-04-04 13:42:21	@PikFan	even then it might not work
2015-04-04 13:42:22	@Espyo	or time it right
2015-04-04 13:42:30	@PikFan	might have something to do with frames
2015-04-04 13:42:42	@Espyo	of course
2015-04-04 13:42:55	@Espyo	the interval for it to be hit again without going anywhere is probably 1-2 frames
2015-04-04 13:43:02	@Espyo	if you can only throw a Pikmin every other frame
2015-04-04 13:43:09	@Espyo	the Pikmin might not land on the one frame where it's possible
2015-04-04 13:43:53	@PikFan	I see
2015-04-04 13:44:20	@PikFan	there we go!
2015-04-04 13:44:25	@Espyo	quick policy proposal
2015-04-04 13:44:31	@Espyo	on enemy articles
2015-04-04 13:44:36	@Espyo	should the notes be further down?
2015-04-04 13:44:41	@Espyo	they're the 2nd section, at the moment
2015-04-04 13:44:54	@Espyo	and I doubt people care more about the notes than they care about an explanation of its behavior, a guide, etc.
2015-04-04 13:45:04	@Espyo	the notes are just there to complement the article
2015-04-04 13:45:22	@PikFan	their location never bothered me
2015-04-04 13:45:31	@Espyo	it's starting to irk me lately
2015-04-04 13:46:05	@PikFan	but you do raise a good point
2015-04-04 13:46:22	@PikFan	it's supplemental information, so it should go further down
2015-04-04 13:46:36	@Espyo	yeah

2015-04-04 13:55:45	@Espyo	and other people who are fluent could translate
2015-04-04 13:56:31	@Espyo	and they could provide some context to help the translator

2015-04-04 17:03:11	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-04-04 17:03:19	@Espyo	people that want help would check the corners
2015-04-04 17:03:24	@Espyo	so the fact that it's on a corner is good
2015-04-04 17:03:36	@Espyo	but other than that, it's next to the status bar, which is a place people look a lot
2015-04-04 17:03:39	@Espyo	so yeah, it's noticeable
2015-04-04 17:03:44	@Espyo	without being awkward or in the way
2015-04-04 17:03:48	@Espyo	guess that's it

2015-04-04 17:21:37	@Espyo	wha?

2015-04-04 17:24:00	@J	wait, I get it

2015-04-04 17:24:29	@J	if a window is already open, the script just opens in the existing window and exits
2015-04-04 17:24:42	@J	for some reason it thinks it didn't work when this happens, so it tries Firefox
2015-04-04 17:25:16	@Espyo	hmm
2015-04-04 17:25:18	@Espyo	makes sense, then
2015-04-04 17:25:38	@J	well, not really
2015-04-04 17:25:44	@J	not sure why it thinks it failed
2015-04-04 17:25:52	@Espyo	that's a different problem
2015-04-04 17:27:28	@J	I worked it out - the last line the script runs was '<some test> && <do a thing>'
2015-04-04 17:27:44	@J	if the test is false, this statement returns false
2015-04-04 17:28:00	@J	which gets returned as the script's exit code

2015-04-04 17:57:09	@J	also that warnings work
2015-04-04 17:57:30	@Espyo	will this "rm -rf /" my computer
2015-04-04 17:57:44	@Espyo	it's fine if it does, because it's windows

2015-04-04 17:58:38	@Espyo	everything looks spot on from a first look

2015-04-04 17:59:31	@Espyo	on the preview, folder separators show up as "\\"

2015-04-04 18:04:43	@Espyo	also the status bar starts with a lowercase
2015-04-04 18:04:45	@Espyo	that's just bad, and you know it
2015-04-04 18:09:10	@J	tab icons: I would give the others icons, but there are no standard ones that fit (http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html)
2015-04-04 18:09:59	@J	yes, I display various strings such as file paths with \-escapes (in the preview, status bar, warnings, probably others)
2015-04-04 18:10:16	@J	this is to avoid ambiguity - for example, a filename might contain a tab or new line character
2015-04-04 18:10:28	@J	(new line not so much on Windows...)
2015-04-04 18:11:32	@J	I know it looks bad on Windows because it happens to use \ as its path separator - so possibly I could have a special case for Windows and use / instead, since / should work for all the inputs anyway
2015-04-04 18:12:02	@Espyo	hmm
2015-04-04 18:12:11	@Espyo	still, to have icons on only one of them, ech
2015-04-04 18:12:21	@J	okay, I briefly thought about what would happen with path component and drives, but never tested it (they don't exist in the same way on Linux)
2015-04-04 18:12:40	@Espyo	you can have newline in character names on Linux?
2015-04-04 18:12:44	@J	I thought you probably wouldn't want to actually use the drive, but I could make it possible if you think it makes sense
2015-04-04 18:12:47	@J	yeah, anything but / and \0
2015-04-04 18:12:53	@Espyo	huh
2015-04-04 18:12:55	@Espyo	amazing
2015-04-04 18:13:18	@Espyo	you could want to use the drive, actually
2015-04-04 18:13:34	@Espyo	some people have several drives for several things
2015-04-04 18:13:36	@Espyo	well, virtual drives
2015-04-04 18:13:45	@Espyo	and they could have files scattered around they want to rename in bulk
2015-04-04 18:13:52	@Espyo	just as common as having files scattered around in a single drive
2015-04-04 18:13:56	@J	yeah, I've added it to the todo list to look into
2015-04-04 18:14:00	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-04 18:14:21	@Espyo	I think the "Template" part should be something like "Final name template"
2015-04-04 18:14:22	@J	do you have examples of unnecessarily technical language?
2015-04-04 18:14:31	@Espyo	the less people have to think about what a name means, the better
2015-04-04 18:14:41	@J	'Output Template'?
2015-04-04 18:14:48	@Espyo	that works
2015-04-04 18:15:06	@J	I've been using that name in other places
2015-04-04 18:15:17	@Espyo	"The second text entry is a prefix for the name to use for positional groups captured by the regular expression"
2015-04-04 18:15:18	@Espyo	this isn't BAD
2015-04-04 18:15:26	@Espyo	but it takes a full minute for people to get it
2015-04-04 18:15:41	@Espyo	and that's the first sentence
2015-04-04 18:15:52	@Espyo	(of the third paragraph)
2015-04-04 18:16:00	@J	yeah, that's a complicated concept to get across
2015-04-04 18:16:07	@Espyo	no doubt
2015-04-04 18:16:13	@Espyo	but I'm sure you can use simpler words here and there
2015-04-04 18:16:22	@Espyo	well, as long as you have examples somewhere
2015-04-04 18:16:27	@Espyo	then it should be fine
2015-04-04 18:16:34	@J	hmm, not sure I can use simpler words there?
2015-04-04 18:16:55	@J	better sentence structure, sure
2015-04-04 18:17:15	@J	but I can't think of simpler words that convey the same meaning
2015-04-04 18:17:59	@J	and status bar starting with lower case is great
2015-04-04 18:18:55	@J	I'll be going through all the help text again anyway; it's always good to leave it a while and come back to it, see if it still makes sense
2015-04-04 18:19:41	Yoshi2_	indeed
2015-04-04 18:19:57	@J	especially with technical text
2015-04-04 18:20:02	@Espyo	<J> and status bar starting with lower case is great
2015-04-04 18:20:04	Yoshi2_	the "Wtf did I do"-phase doesn't set in until some time later
2015-04-04 18:20:09	@Espyo	literally the only programs that do this have your name in the credits
2015-04-04 18:20:26	@J	I said it's great
2015-04-04 18:20:29	@J	case closed
2015-04-04 18:20:48	@Espyo	you're a mad-man
2015-04-04 18:20:51	@Espyo	don't do it
2015-04-04 18:20:56	@Espyo	you don't understand the consequences
2015-04-04 18:20:59	@J	don't change it?
2015-04-04 18:21:02	@J	sure
2015-04-04 18:21:24	@Espyo	don't submit it with lowercase status bar
2015-04-04 18:21:26	Yoshi2_	lower case status bar text?
2015-04-04 18:21:27	@Espyo	I'm sure Testyo agrees
2015-04-04 18:21:28	Testyo	if I had written a small Pikipedia todo list for myself
2015-04-04 18:21:37	@Espyo	he would add "put status bar in uppercase"
2015-04-04 18:21:39	@Espyo	right, Testyo?
2015-04-04 18:21:40	Testyo	get around to that doesn't sound right
2015-04-04 18:21:48	@Espyo	of course it doesn't sound right
2015-04-04 18:21:56	@Espyo	it's something that should be that way from the START
2015-04-04 18:22:00	@Espyo	right, Testyo?
2015-04-04 18:22:01	Testyo	I can't seem to beat my mhm
2015-04-04 18:22:05	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-04 18:22:13	@J	anyway
2015-04-04 18:22:20	@Espyo	let me try an actual rename run
2015-04-04 18:23:31	@Espyo	how's about the number of files to be affected, number of warnings, and number of fields, in the tabs?
2015-04-04 18:24:10	@J	only files really matters, IMO
2015-04-04 18:24:26	@Espyo	warnings has the read, yes
2015-04-04 18:24:31	@J	number of warnings doesn't matter because just 1 warning is bad
2015-04-04 18:24:42	Yoshi2_	something I find to be a bit crazy: the program folder is 26 MB
2015-04-04 18:24:44	@Espyo	but it's not entirely intuitive that black text = no warnings, until after some small time
2015-04-04 18:24:45	@J	fields, why would you care?
2015-04-04 18:25:17	@J	hmm, I get what you mean
2015-04-04 18:25:26	@J	if it said 'Warnings (0)' it would be really obvious there are none
2015-04-04 18:25:32	Yoshi2_	but I guess that is the price you pay for having no dependencies
2015-04-04 18:25:37	@Espyo	exactly
2015-04-04 18:25:50	@Espyo	all right, renamed successfully
2015-04-04 18:25:54	@J	Yoshi2_: qt is just really big

2015-04-04 18:26:07	@Espyo	what if each line in the preview was double-clickable
2015-04-04 18:26:14	@Espyo	and when you double-click it, it opens the folder where the file is?
2015-04-04 18:26:14	@J	this is with heavily compressed binaries too, I got ~60% compression
2015-04-04 18:26:28	@J	(ie. 100% -> 40%)

2015-04-04 18:33:00	@J	Yoshi2: what do you think about only one of the tabs having an icon?
2015-04-04 18:33:37	Yoshi2	J: which tab will have an icon?
2015-04-04 18:34:01	@J	Warnings currently does (should) have an icon, Preview and Fields don't
2015-04-04 18:34:08	Yoshi2	hmmmm
2015-04-04 18:34:18	Yoshi2	it's not the end of the world
2015-04-04 18:34:29	Yoshi2	I'm not a fan of having too many icons anyway
2015-04-04 18:35:12	@J	I kind of like them - they make it easier to identify things, especially in interfaces you use often
2015-04-04 18:35:13	Yoshi2	Warning having an icon actually seems like a good idea because it basically says "Heeeey, look at me, I might be important if something goes wrong!"
2015-04-04 18:35:42	@Espyo	right, but if there are no warnings, it's best to keep hush hush
2015-04-04 18:35:53	Yoshi2	hmmm
2015-04-04 18:35:59	Yoshi2	yes
2015-04-04 18:36:20	@J	well I don't want to only add the icon when there are warnings
2015-04-04 18:36:25	@J	would make the tabs jump around
2015-04-04 18:36:47	@Espyo	it would
2015-04-04 18:39:22	@J	oh, yeah - the filesize thing is an annoying Windows problem, really, in 2 ways
2015-04-04 18:39:44	@J	already mentioned libraries (eg. here, the qt5-base package is ~50MiB, but lots of applications use it)
2015-04-04 18:40:23	@J	but I also have to ship icons, because the way 'standard' Windows icon theming works isn't interoperable enough for me to use it
2015-04-04 18:40:35	@J	you pretty much have to be using 1st party MS libraries

2015-04-04 18:44:44	@Espyo	that rings a bell, yeah
2015-04-04 18:46:26	@J	anyway, most important thing is that you can work out how to use it using the help

2015-04-04 19:53:12	@J	it's pretty good
2015-04-04 19:53:19	@J	it doesn't seem to always scroll to the right point
2015-04-04 19:53:31	@J	so sometimes I can't see anything highlighted
2015-04-04 19:54:05	@J	oh, but it seems to work with 'Go'
2015-04-04 19:54:17	@J	as in, pressing next finds a problem and scrolls, but not always to the right place
2015-04-04 19:54:25	@J	pressing Go after that scrolls to the right place
2015-04-04 19:56:07	@J	I would recommend moving the problem implementations outside of that one function - make a function for each, in an array or object, and call them all

2015-04-04 20:04:53	@J	there are obviously going to be loads of false positives you can try to avoid

2015-04-04 20:14:01	@Espyo	@olimar: that's why the captain is a question
2015-04-04 20:14:09	@Espyo	I was meant to make it ignore Olimar and Charlie
2015-04-04 20:14:12	@Espyo	must've forgotten
2015-04-04 20:14:53	@Espyo	even still, it could refer to Olimar or Charlie without using their names

2015-04-04 21:47:54	@Espyo	it's harder if there's a function that does the searching, and inside, there's more functions
2015-04-04 21:48:01	@Espyo	it could be easier if they were called multiple times

2015-04-05 15:55:38	@Espyo	well, I tried running the analyzer on chrome to see if I could find the selection problems
2015-04-05 15:55:41	@Espyo	lolno, fuck this
2015-04-05 15:55:49	@Espyo	apparently it's nearly impossible to run user scripts in chrome
2015-04-05 15:56:11	@Espyo	for security reasons, only extensions and scripts from the chrome store will be enableable
2015-04-05 15:56:22	@Espyo	unless you active a lot of preferences and startup switches to specify otherwise
2015-04-05 15:56:25	@Espyo	this looks like some poor joke
2015-04-05 15:57:17	@J	a lot of the chrome debug stuff is available on other browsers
2015-04-05 15:57:23	@J	it's just all JavaScript
2015-04-05 15:57:52	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-05 15:58:01	@Espyo	but I had to try chrome because the selection thing works fine for me on Firefox
2015-04-05 15:58:09	@Espyo	only other choice I have is try chrome and see if it messes up there
2015-04-05 15:58:15	@Espyo	you sure you didn't just do something wrong?
2015-04-05 15:58:34	@Espyo	it should select automatically when the scan is finished or when you go to the previous or next problem
2015-04-05 15:58:45	@Espyo	works on tablet as well
2015-04-05 15:58:49	@Espyo	both Chrome and Firefox
2015-04-05 16:02:06	@J	like I said, it makes the selection, but doesn't scroll to it
2015-04-05 16:02:16	@J	it scrolls _somewhere_, but not to the right place
2015-04-05 16:02:32	@Espyo	that should be handled by the browser
2015-04-05 16:02:48	@Espyo	...you could probably use that excuse for any script

2015-04-05 17:50:30	@J	it does look very suspicious
2015-04-05 17:50:32	@Espyo	only then do I implement it
2015-04-05 17:50:45	@J	well how is it even scrolling ATM then?
2015-04-05 17:51:04	@J	also this is from 2011
2015-04-05 17:51:06	@Espyo	Firefox is just doing it by itself
2015-04-05 17:51:16	@J	but it's not doing nothing for me

2015-04-05 17:54:44	@Espyo	there is no "go to selection" part
2015-04-05 17:54:49	@Espyo	like I said, I only select the text
2015-04-05 17:54:52	@Espyo	Firefox scrolls by itself
2015-04-05 17:54:57	@J	[17:53:18] @J or the 'select text' part, if it's just caused by that
2015-04-05 17:55:31	@Espyo	but how will I know that I've fixed it if I always get the right behavior?
2015-04-05 17:55:47	@Espyo	but well, go on line 690
2015-04-05 17:55:53	@Espyo	and just duplicate that line, then...
2015-04-05 17:56:42	@J	690 is a comment
2015-04-05 17:56:59	@Espyo	how in the world...
2015-04-05 17:57:09	@Espyo	all right, the end of the pikan.show_problem function
2015-04-05 17:57:21	@Espyo	just search for "pikan.show_problem = function"
2015-04-05 17:58:55	@J	why did it alert a load of times
2015-04-05 17:59:17	@Espyo	we can't be running the same script
2015-04-05 17:59:22	@Espyo	how many lines is yours?
2015-04-05 18:02:05	@J	1115
2015-04-05 18:02:11	@J	with the duplicated line
2015-04-05 18:02:29	@Espyo	.......I specifically made sure I didn't put the OLD one in my dropbox
2015-04-05 18:02:33	@Espyo	I blame windows somehow
2015-04-05 18:03:13	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/pikan.user.js
2015-04-05 18:03:14	@Espyo	there
2015-04-05 18:03:26	@Espyo	not sure if it'll solve the problem
2015-04-05 18:03:32	@Espyo	but at least that's the RIGHT thing
2015-04-05 18:08:14	@J	it's really weird
2015-04-05 18:08:42	@J	the 'Select' button _always_ works properly
2015-04-05 18:09:36	@Espyo	...
2015-04-05 18:09:39	@J	goto_problem() called manually doesn't
2015-04-05 18:10:12	@J	no matter how many times I call it
2015-04-05 18:10:30	@J	ooh
2015-04-05 18:10:35	@J	I worked out the difference
2015-04-05 18:10:44	@Espyo	any conclusion?
2015-04-05 18:10:50	@J	when I click 'Select', it changes focus from the textarea to the button
2015-04-05 18:11:02	@Espyo	but it did so too in the old script
2015-04-05 18:11:08	@J	so it's only scrolling to the right place when it also switches focus to the textarea
2015-04-05 18:11:17	@J	wha?
2015-04-05 18:11:19	@Espyo	but
2015-04-05 18:11:21	@Espyo	it ALWAYS did that
2015-04-05 18:11:27	@J	the old script behaves exactly like the new one
2015-04-05 18:11:43	@J	I'm not sure why you're expecting it to be different
2015-04-05 18:13:07	@Espyo	okay, I made most of the script on my tablet, during subway rides
2015-04-05 18:13:19	@Espyo	and occasionally passed it to PC to check out if it's right
2015-04-05 18:13:47	@Espyo	I had a kinda-unstable version with alerts and missing stuff (the button was called "go" instead of "select")
2015-04-05 18:14:04	@Espyo	and I merged that wip version with my "stable" PC version
2015-04-05 18:14:10	@Espyo	but I sent you the wip version
2015-04-05 18:14:19	@Espyo	only now did I send you the correct, final version
2015-04-05 18:14:28	@J	I know
2015-04-05 18:14:33	@Espyo	but you're saying that with the wip version, the textbox didn't go to the selection
2015-04-05 18:14:37	@Espyo	but it does now with the final version
2015-04-05 18:14:38	@J	yeah
2015-04-05 18:14:41	@J	no, it doesn't
2015-04-05 18:14:43	@J	I never said that
2015-04-05 18:14:47	@J	show me where I said that
2015-04-05 18:14:52	@Espyo	<J> the 'Select' button _always_ works properly
2015-04-05 18:15:03	@Espyo	pretty sure you said the go button of old never did
2015-04-05 18:15:03	@J	you haven't really been paying attention, have you?
2015-04-05 18:15:07	@J	that's what I said the whole time
2015-04-05 18:15:22	@J	the 'find next problem' arrow button thing doesn't scroll properly
2015-04-05 18:15:27	@J	the Go/Select button does
2015-04-05 18:15:34	@Espyo	but how can that be?!
2015-04-05 18:15:40	@J	I just said
2015-04-05 18:15:42	@Espyo	if that function CALLS the same function that the select button does
2015-04-05 18:15:48	@J	[18:10:35] @J I worked out the difference
2015-04-05 18:15:50	@J	[18:10:50] @J when I click 'Select', it changes focus from the textarea to the button
2015-04-05 18:15:53	@J	[18:11:08] @J so it's only scrolling to the right place when it also switches focus to the textarea
2015-04-05 18:16:06	@Espyo	but it ALWAYS changes focus, regardless of what button you press
2015-04-05 18:16:13	@Espyo	previous, next, skip type, and select
2015-04-05 18:16:16	@Espyo	they all change focus
2015-04-05 18:16:21	@Espyo	to the textbox
2015-04-05 18:16:49	@J	yeah, I wasn't comparing it to pressing the next button, I was comparing it to adding a second call to goto_problem() in the code
2015-04-05 18:16:55	@J	that second call won't change focus
2015-04-05 18:17:05	@J	'won't have had the focus changed'
2015-04-05 18:17:08	@Espyo	<J> the 'find next problem' arrow button thing doesn't scroll properly
2015-04-05 18:17:08	@Espyo	<J> the Go/Select button does
2015-04-05 18:17:11	@Espyo	you just compared
2015-04-05 18:17:47	@Espyo	not quite sure we're on the same page, here
2015-04-05 18:17:47	@J	but before I was talking about a second call
2015-04-05 18:17:59	@J	because it was about 10 minutes ago
2015-04-05 18:18:07	@J	and that's what I was talking about at the time
2015-04-05 18:18:12	@J	[18:08:42] @J the 'Select' button _always_ works properly
2015-04-05 18:18:14	@J	[18:09:39] @J goto_problem() called manually doesn't
2015-04-05 18:19:02	@J	if I click off the textarea, then call goto_problem() manually, it works
2015-04-05 18:19:21	@Espyo	so wait
2015-04-05 18:19:34	@Espyo	if the textarea is in focus
2015-04-05 18:19:37	@Espyo	you scroll away
2015-04-05 18:19:41	@Espyo	and then click the select button
2015-04-05 18:19:44	@Espyo	it won't scroll to the right place?
2015-04-05 18:19:52	@J	it does
2015-04-05 18:20:00	@J	the select button always works
2015-04-05 18:20:12	@Espyo	all right, let's backpedal a bit
2015-04-05 18:20:17	@J	when I say 'call goto_problem() manually', I mean I'm typing it in the console
2015-04-05 18:20:19	@Espyo	WHY are you calling goto_problem standalone?
2015-04-05 18:20:47	@J	because I expected calling it twice to work, but it didn't
2015-04-05 18:20:51	@J	now I worked out why
2015-04-05 18:20:57	@J	anyway, yeah
2015-04-05 18:21:11	@J	so there is something different with the first call
2015-04-05 18:21:29	@J	I'll try removing any call to goto_problem() from the 'next' function
2015-04-05 18:21:33	@J	then pressing Select
2015-04-05 18:22:37	@Espyo	hm
2015-04-05 18:23:16	@J	yep, I have to press it twice
2015-04-05 18:23:17	@J	weird
2015-04-05 18:23:25	@J	so it's not even a timing thing
2015-04-05 18:23:46	@Espyo	really weird
2015-04-05 18:24:18	@Espyo	well, there are some returns in the goto_problem function
2015-04-05 18:24:24	@Espyo	but I doubt they're being run
2015-04-05 18:24:36	@Espyo	only thing I can think of
2015-04-05 18:24:45	@Espyo	is that changing the selection doesn't scroll correctly
2015-04-05 18:24:48	@Espyo	but using .focus() does
2015-04-05 18:24:58	@Espyo	and it calls .focus() first and only then sets the selection
2015-04-05 18:24:59	@J	and only if it actually changes the focus
2015-04-05 18:25:12	@Espyo	yyyyyyes, apparently
2015-04-05 18:25:19	@Espyo	it's so weird because it's not like that here at all
2015-04-05 18:25:29	@J	have you tested Chrome?
2015-04-05 18:25:35	@J	or another Webkit browser?
2015-04-05 18:25:41	@Espyo	like I said, chrome has a vendetta against user scripts
2015-04-05 18:25:47	@Espyo	what other ones are there?
2015-04-05 18:26:25	@J	Midori, Konqueror, I think Safari and Opera nowadays

2015-04-07 22:52:47	@J	amazing
2015-04-07 22:55:32	@Espyo	it's so
2015-04-07 22:55:37	@Espyo	innocent
2015-04-07 22:55:50	@Espyo	it's so obvious in hindsight
2015-04-07 22:55:52	@Espyo	that this could happen
2015-04-07 22:56:06	@Espyo	I love it
2015-04-07 22:56:10	@Espyo	and they didn't fix it for NPC
2015-04-07 22:56:13	@Espyo	but DID fix it for P2
2015-04-07 23:10:42	@J	wait
2015-04-07 23:10:58	@J	what video did you try to link me to?
2015-04-07 23:12:32	@Espyo	oh
2015-04-07 23:12:39	@Espyo	I DID mean to link to the spaghetti video
2015-04-07 23:12:48	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DKvQoqUzBw but I forgot to link to this too
2015-04-07 23:12:55	@Espyo	I saw the 8 in the URL, thought it was the B in this one's url
2015-04-07 23:12:58	@Espyo	just called it a day
2015-04-07 23:13:51	@J	sometimes I don't even
2015-04-07 23:15:04	@J	wait, how could they fix it for P2 if P2 was the first game with it?
2015-04-07 23:15:15	@J	I mean, don't you mean they broke it for NPC?
2015-04-07 23:15:20	@Espyo	did I link to the wrong video again
2015-04-07 23:15:29	@Espyo	..........
2015-04-07 23:15:37	@J	quite possibly
2015-04-07 23:16:02	@J	I think your clipboard's out of control
2015-04-07 23:16:05	@J	also your limbs
2015-04-07 23:16:07	UltraMario	it's a japanese video
2015-04-07 23:16:10	@Espyo	all right
2015-04-07 23:16:12	@Espyo	I double-checked
2015-04-07 23:16:19	@Espyo	this is the video I wanted to share about a glitch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsoik7Cr6Uk
2015-04-07 23:16:29	@Espyo	I mean, sure, the Volatile Dweevil glitch video is shareable too
2015-04-07 23:16:30	@Espyo	but it's old
2015-04-07 23:17:38	@J	I like how they don't even die
2015-04-07 23:17:46	@J	wonder if your count goes down
2015-04-07 23:18:01	@Espyo	I checked, it doesn't
2015-04-07 23:24:22	Testyo	I booted ubuntu as a live cd to check the temperatures, and they were fine understand certain commands

2015-04-08 16:34:37	Klemen702	hello.. sorry about yesterday... was a bit in a hurry
2015-04-08 16:36:14	Yoshi2	no problem
2015-04-08 16:37:34	Klemen702	just needed to ask a question, it seems he is gone for a few days
2015-04-08 16:40:10	Yoshi2	not that I know of, espyo was here yesterday
2015-04-08 16:40:19	Yoshi2	he joined one hour after you left
2015-04-08 16:40:34	Yoshi2	so you might just be unlucky
2015-04-08 16:41:45	Klemen702	oh weird
2015-04-08 16:41:51	Klemen702	i almost always see most of you in chat
2015-04-08 16:42:01	Klemen702	but we all have lives i guess
2015-04-08 16:42:25	Yoshi2	indeed
2015-04-08 16:42:43	Yoshi2	there are also timezones
2015-04-08 16:42:49	Klemen702	yeahđ
2015-04-08 16:42:52	Klemen702	yeah*
2015-04-08 16:43:31	Yoshi2	so you have more luck seeing him when it is evening for him
2015-04-08 16:43:56	Yoshi2	and when his work day is over
2015-04-08 16:44:46	Klemen702	what's his time zone?
2015-04-08 17:00:40	Klemen702	''It is the first original entry in the Pikmin franchise in 9 years, since the original release of Pikmin 2 on the GameCube in 2004. '' from the pikmin 3 page, can someone define ''original'' in this case
2015-04-08 17:03:11	Yoshi2	Klemen702: check portugal's timezone, I think it is UTC+1 with daylight saving time in effect
2015-04-08 17:03:22	Yoshi2	right now it should be 5 pm for him
2015-04-08 17:04:06	Yoshi2	Klemen702: original probably means that the game is not a re-release
2015-04-08 17:04:11	Klemen702	my time zone is only 1 hour above his, i guess it makes sense why i see him alot
2015-04-08 17:04:20	Klemen702	ah okay thanks

2015-04-10 20:21:58	@Espyo	hi
2015-04-10 20:23:03	Yoshi2	Espyo: how's testyo's new feature?
2015-04-10 20:23:11	@Espyo	still WIP
2015-04-10 20:23:15	@Espyo	MAYBE I'll finish today
2015-04-10 20:23:54	Yoshi2	I see
2015-04-10 20:24:10	Yoshi2	I'm currently working on a sudoku solver
2015-04-10 20:26:42	Yoshi2	but I'll probably drop it soon
2015-04-10 20:27:23	Yoshi2	it can solve some simple puzzles, and I'm currently adding a brute forcer, but implementing more solving techniques is difficult
2015-04-10 20:33:26	@Espyo	nice
2015-04-10 20:37:12	Yoshi2	alright
2015-04-10 20:37:25	Yoshi2	note to myself: a sudoku bruteforcer is not viable
2015-04-10 20:41:55	@Espyo	haha, I honestly doubt it'd be
2015-04-10 20:45:14	Yoshi2	I thought it might work better if I ran it at a point where a lot of values on the field are known
2015-04-10 20:45:19	Yoshi2	but my code is not very fast
2015-04-10 20:48:28	@Espyo	hmm
2015-04-10 20:49:00	Yoshi2	because I set the values and then validate the resulting sudoku
2015-04-10 20:55:19	Yoshi2	micro optimisation works very well if you do something thousands of times in a short timespan
2015-04-10 20:56:51	Yoshi2	but bruteforcing something like this means that you are dealing with exponential growth
2015-04-10 20:57:26	Yoshi2	well, at least something similar to that

2015-04-11 07:38:49	UltraMario	hi
2015-04-11 07:39:14	Yoshi2	are you talking about mibbit?
2015-04-11 07:39:27	Thatone	I'm new here. I just sort of came here out of curiosity.
2015-04-11 07:40:27	Thatone	Mibbit?
2015-04-11 07:41:31	Thatone	Oh, I see. It's the chat client.
2015-04-11 07:42:10	Yoshi2	mibbit is the web chat client that is embedded on the pikmin wiki
2015-04-11 07:42:54	Thatone	I was just bored and went and explored the regions of this wiki that I hadn't already. Then I found this chat room.
2015-04-11 07:43:43	Yoshi2	if I remember correctly, by default anybody who hasn't written anything in 10 minutes will be shown as an idler in mibbit
2015-04-11 07:44:01	Thatone	Oh, alright.
2015-04-11 07:44:59	Thatone	Well, this seems like a pretty nice Pikmin chat room.
2015-04-11 07:45:05	Yoshi2	yup, this chat room is the official irc channel of pikipedia
2015-04-11 07:46:52	Yoshi2	it is also possible to join this channel using any other irc client
2015-04-11 07:47:22	Thatone	Neat. I was afraid this place was going to be dead when I got here like it is with a lot of chats I've been to.
2015-04-11 07:49:21	Thatone	I'm actually really pleased to see that it's atleast somewhat lively.
2015-04-11 07:50:50	Yoshi2	it can be very quiet at times due to some of the users being busy doing other things
2015-04-11 07:51:18	Thatone	Yeah.
2015-04-11 07:51:52	Thatone	Well, I'm going to go now. 
2015-04-11 07:52:05	Yoshi2	alrighty, see you
2015-04-11 07:52:23	Thatone	I think I might return later on though. This place isn't half bad.

2015-04-13 20:02:09	Klemen702	hello
2015-04-13 20:02:28	Ultimate	Hi!
2015-04-13 20:02:44	Ultimate	I'm playing Pokémon Rumble World!
2015-04-13 20:02:54	Klemen702	great i guess
2015-04-13 20:03:08	Ultimate	Something to say I suppose...
2015-04-13 20:03:14	Klemen702	yeah
2015-04-13 20:03:25	Klemen702	a small topic is good enough
2015-04-13 20:03:33	Ultimate	Yup
2015-04-13 20:03:59	Klemen702	i'm playing something too i guess... terraria to be exact
2015-04-13 20:04:11	Ultimate	I have that on my phone.
2015-04-13 20:06:33	Klemen702	alot of people have it on phone and not on steam it seems
2015-04-13 20:06:40	Klemen702	i wonder why is that
2015-04-13 20:07:03	Ultimate	Portable I guess...
2015-04-13 20:07:15	Ultimate	I used to have it on Steam but...
2015-04-13 20:08:03	Klemen702	yeah probably, my phone is very weak to run most games
2015-04-13 20:08:47	Ultimate	Mine too, Terraria lags way too much when I open it.
2015-04-13 20:08:54	Klemen702	:/
2015-04-13 20:09:55	Klemen702	atleast i will be porting my data to a laptop soon, should run way faster than normal
2015-04-13 20:10:08	Klemen702	i kinda have a horrible computer :P
2015-04-13 20:10:32	Ultimate	But what if the computer breaks down?
2015-04-13 20:11:03	Klemen702	which one?
2015-04-13 20:11:50	Ultimate	Both I guess...
2015-04-13 20:12:45	Klemen702	i could still install it if i get another one... just going to have to get all the progress back
2015-04-13 20:13:13	Ultimate	Depends how much you play the games I suppose.
2015-04-13 20:13:31	Klemen702	it would be very frustrating to lose progress, i have like 5 ankh shield items lol
2015-04-13 20:14:00	Klemen702	i play them somewhat alot
2015-04-13 20:14:50	Ultimate	So if your computer and laptop break down, you're pretty much screwed.
2015-04-13 20:15:12	Klemen702	well
2015-04-13 20:15:22	Klemen702	i still could use other people's computers...
2015-04-13 20:15:25	Klemen702	just less for gaming
2015-04-13 20:15:44	Klemen702	but i also find it unlikely for my computers to break
2015-04-13 20:16:02	Ultimate	Well at least you're confident.
2015-04-13 20:17:12	Klemen702	:)

2015-04-14 19:30:08	Ultimate	Looks like Testyo is the new Annoying Orange... -_-
2015-04-14 19:30:09	Testyo	oooo, probably not at the same time
2015-04-14 19:30:25	Ultimate	What do you mean?
2015-04-14 19:30:30	Yoshi2	hey Testyo & Espyo 
2015-04-14 19:30:30	Testyo	Why it was special, all I knew is that it was
2015-04-14 19:31:05	Ultimate	It's kinda fun talking to you Testyo, I don't do it often.
2015-04-14 19:31:06	Testyo	yeah, I sent the file you probably saved it as merge, not merge.py
2015-04-14 19:31:30	@Espyo	hi
2015-04-14 19:31:35	Ultimate	...Ok... :/
2015-04-14 19:32:03	Ultimate	(Why is Testyo talking about files?)
2015-04-14 19:32:04	Testyo	stuff is a literal madhouse
2015-04-14 19:32:17	@Espyo	(because we talked about files before

2015-04-14 19:32:34	Ultimate	(It's a bit strange)
2015-04-14 19:33:08	Yoshi2	talking about files is strange?
2015-04-14 19:33:08	Ultimate	So... How's life?
2015-04-14 19:33:36	Yoshi2	if you swap the l and f in life, you get file
2015-04-14 19:33:41	Yoshi2	coincidence? I think not!
2015-04-14 19:34:08	Ultimate	No, it's a bit of a random response to: 'It's fun talking to you.'
2015-04-14 19:35:45	Yoshi2	it's not just a bit of a random responses
2015-04-14 19:36:05	Ultimate	How?
2015-04-14 19:36:07	Yoshi2	*response
2015-04-14 19:36:47	Ultimate	...
2015-04-14 19:37:16	Yoshi2	if we delve a bit into the technical stuff, testyo actually takes a bit each from two random responses
2015-04-14 19:37:17	Testyo	should I just keep heh
2015-04-14 19:37:20	Yoshi2	and merges them together
2015-04-14 19:37:36	Yoshi2	so in most cases, the message you see is the result of two random messages
2015-04-14 19:37:59	Ultimate	That's a bit weird.
2015-04-14 19:38:16	Ultimate	But kind of amusing!:P
2015-04-14 19:38:26	Yoshi2	and the two random messages are taken from everything that has been said in the channel
2015-04-14 19:38:39	Ultimate	Cool.

2015-04-14 19:41:34	Ultimate	... At least Testyo's first message makes sense.
2015-04-14 19:41:35	Testyo	or 0.035 'units' the electricity company charges you show one's game information at a time
2015-04-14 19:41:55	Ultimate	But that didn't...
2015-04-14 19:42:18	Yoshi2	it makes sense
2015-04-14 19:42:45	Ultimate	Well not in this context, isn't that right, Testyo?
2015-04-14 19:42:46	Testyo	but after asking somebody if I could do it, them yet, still trying to save up myself
2015-04-14 19:42:58	Yoshi2	"0.035 'units', which the electricity company charges you, show one's game information at a time"
2015-04-14 19:43:27	Ultimate	That does make sense, but it doesn't fit into the conversation.
2015-04-14 19:43:34	Ultimate	I'm just saying.
2015-04-14 19:43:53	Yoshi2	whether the message fits into the conversation is a while other story
2015-04-14 19:44:25	Ultimate	We could get into that, but I'd rather not.
2015-04-14 19:44:28	Yoshi2	you have to be very lucky to see testyo reply with a message that makes sense AND fits into the current conversation
2015-04-14 19:44:29	Testyo	yeah... track: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3o3eh8vymibye0/demobgm_musicPiece%234.midi?dl=0
2015-04-14 19:44:39	Yoshi2	*is a whole other story
2015-04-14 19:44:43	Ultimate	Ooh! Hyperlink!
2015-04-14 19:45:24	Ultimate	Not a very interesting one though...

2015-04-14 21:01:45	Ultimate	Greetings, Testyo!
2015-04-14 21:01:46	Testyo	no wonder I confused you — was surreal
2015-04-14 21:02:13	Ultimate	Yes, it was surreal. How are you Testyo?
2015-04-14 21:02:14	Testyo	and the energy saving was paid for by companies who produce these sockets that can be switched off
2015-04-14 21:02:26	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2015-04-14 21:02:26	Testyo	I said and the energy saving was paid for by companies who produce these sockets that can be switched off because Ultimate mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages and the latest is well over 2 and I bet the news about the energy saving was paid for by companies who produce these sockets that can be switched off. They were joined by the common word the.
2015-04-14 21:02:44	Yoshi2	mhmmm, close enough
2015-04-14 21:03:16	Ultimate	Nice, I knew I'd be very lucky someday.
2015-04-14 21:03:26	Ultimate	Thanks, Testyo!
2015-04-14 21:03:27	Testyo	are you gonna do that for images...

2015-04-14 21:05:38	Yoshi2	whether the 3ds is any use depends on what you have in mind

2015-04-15 19:03:00	@Espyo	the art made with Inkscape uses shapes
2015-04-15 19:03:06	@Espyo	circles, squares, etc.
2015-04-15 19:03:13	@Espyo	so it ends up being easier to manipulate, but less flexible

2015-04-16 18:46:07	Yoshi2_	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-04-16 18:46:08	Testyo	and then somewhere have a way to have a full that's programming?
2015-04-16 18:47:56	@Espyo	hi
2015-04-16 18:51:35	Yoshi2_	Espyo: do you happen to have some advice for somebody who starts learning to program in C?
2015-04-16 18:55:41	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-16 18:55:46	@Espyo	try your best to understand what a pointer is
2015-04-16 18:55:52	@Espyo	and don't overcomplicate what a pointer is
2015-04-16 18:55:57	@Espyo	if you grasp pointers, you grasp C
2015-04-16 18:56:06	@Espyo	if not, you have more luck making a program by stabbing yourself with a spork
2015-04-16 20:19:30	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd8KVI84r9k this video ended up way more epic than it needed
2015-04-16 20:19:31	Testyo	9 K = -264.15 °C / -443.47 °F
2015-04-16 20:22:20	Yoshi2_	every single peace of artwork shown in that video is awesome
2015-04-16 20:23:21	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-16 20:23:36	@Espyo	but the production of the video itself ended up far better than I expected
2015-04-16 20:23:42	Yoshi2_	*piece of artwork
2015-04-16 20:23:48	@Espyo	we've got some really talented people in our fandom
2015-04-16 20:23:50	@Espyo	makes me feel happy
2015-04-16 20:24:03	Yoshi2_	indeed
2015-04-16 20:24:32	Yoshi2_	the video itself came out very nice
2015-04-16 20:24:48	Yoshi2_	switching artwork to the tact of the music works pretty well
2015-04-16 20:25:01	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-16 20:28:32	Yoshi2_	do you think I'd get a spot in one of those videos if I finished my pikmin music/bms converter?
2015-04-16 20:28:34	Yoshi2_	probably not
2015-04-16 20:28:41	Yoshi2_	wouldn't fit in very well
2015-04-16 20:29:41	@Espyo	you could

2015-04-16 20:30:03	Yoshi2_	heh
2015-04-16 20:30:17	@Espyo	hey, he could even use a midi-version of a song as background music
2015-04-16 20:31:16	Yoshi2_	I do need to get back to doing work on the bms stuff at some point
2015-04-16 20:31:39	Yoshi2_	considering that my interest in the irc bot is dropping slowly
2015-04-16 20:32:19	Yoshi2_	let's see what arookas has done so far
2015-04-16 20:34:50	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-16 20:35:47	Yoshi2_	information about 0xC9 and 0xCA commands, woohoo
2015-04-16 20:36:20	Yoshi2_	the bms files start to look more and more like instructions for an audio processor
2015-04-16 20:36:40	@Espyo	I bet
2015-04-16 20:39:12	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2015-04-16 20:39:31	Yoshi2	by the way, looks like I have a nice little ipv6 address
2015-04-16 20:40:11	Yoshi2	I found out that I had to enable ipv6 in my router before I could use that
2015-04-16 20:40:31	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-04-16 20:40:39	@Espyo	probably works for most modern routers
2015-04-16 20:41:09	Yoshi2	modern-ish
2015-04-16 20:41:21	Yoshi2	I think my router is a few years old at least

2015-04-17 19:37:19	TheRedPikMayor	THey are both the same object, however, they each have different info I believe that should be succesfully merged as reccomended
2015-04-17 19:37:28	Yoshi2	<TheRedPikMayor> I needed some help merging two pages of the same item?
2015-04-17 19:37:29	Yoshi2	<TheRedPikMayor> They are Fake Noodle Thing, and adults only emblem
2015-04-17 19:37:31	Yoshi2	Espyo: ^
2015-04-17 19:37:48	TheRedPikMayor	They are the same, one has the wrong name.
2015-04-17 19:38:26	TheRedPikMayor	THey have all the same stats and same item design, however, one of them has more info on the item.
2015-04-17 19:39:15	TheRedPikMayor	I believe that they should be merged, as they are the same statwise and texturewise.
2015-04-17 19:40:20	TheRedPikMayor	Theres no need to have two of the same item with one being in pal I believe, but part of a different set, and with a different name, and one being from the japanese version i believe.
2015-04-17 19:40:31	TheRedPikMayor	However they have the same stats, so they can be merged.
2015-04-17 19:41:22	TheRedPikMayor	Nevermind
2015-04-17 19:41:47	TheRedPikMayor	Information on both pages state they are in the japanese version only, thus rendering them the same item.
2015-04-17 19:42:22	TheRedPikMayor	Nvm on that, same as previously stated.
2015-04-17 19:42:35	TheRedPikMayor	THey are the same treasures, just from the pal and japanese versions.
2015-04-17 19:42:45	TheRedPikMayor	Sorry for spam, trying to at least sound proffensional.
2015-04-17 19:43:29	TheRedPikMayor	Yoshi, could you possibly help with this merge?
2015-04-17 19:44:06	TheRedPikMayor	If they even deserve to be merged? Both are stubs btw

2015-04-17 19:48:12	@Espyo	yeah, I'm not quite sure what we should do with them...
2015-04-17 19:48:13	TheRedPikMayor	Yeah
2015-04-17 19:48:27	TheRedPikMayor	They do have limited info.
2015-04-17 19:48:38	TheRedPikMayor	I might have a friend if possible find more info for you guys
2015-04-17 19:48:40	@Espyo	where did their names even come from?
2015-04-17 19:48:47	TheRedPikMayor	I dont know.
2015-04-17 19:48:53	@Espyo	we have pages for all Japanese treasures
2015-04-17 19:48:58	@Espyo	but those two pages existed before
2015-04-17 19:49:00	@Espyo	with mysterious names
2015-04-17 19:49:03	TheRedPikMayor	But some limited infos
2015-04-17 19:49:06	TheRedPikMayor	and i do know
2015-04-17 19:49:09	@Espyo	right
2015-04-17 19:49:16	@Espyo	well, we could use more info, sure
2015-04-17 19:49:22	@Espyo	and the same treatment as other treasures
2015-04-17 19:49:26	@Espyo	like photos of real world objects
2015-04-17 19:49:55	TheRedPikMayor	My friend can translate the japanese stuff, and ill see if he can get any of the stuff. I know he lives in japan
2015-04-17 19:50:32	TheRedPikMayor	And ill try and see if i can get some photos of the objects as well
2015-04-17 19:51:21	TheRedPikMayor	So pictures of the objects on real life, or the ones ingame as well, as we lack some of those too
2015-04-17 19:51:30	@Espyo	all right
2015-04-17 19:51:31	@Espyo	that's pretty awesome
2015-04-17 19:51:40	@Espyo	oh yeah, in-game images too
2015-04-17 19:51:41	@Espyo	we need those
2015-04-17 19:51:45	TheRedPikMayor	K.
2015-04-17 19:52:16	TheRedPikMayor	He might be able to get some, I think if we could get some Japanese roms we could get those as well as the pal roms for the pictures
2015-04-17 19:52:30	TheRedPikMayor	Anything I can do I will try to do
2015-04-17 19:52:34	Yoshi2	TheRedPikMayor: for the future, you do not need to write long paragraphs of text like what you did earlier to sound professional
2015-04-17 19:52:46	TheRedPikMayor	I know, im just nervous.
2015-04-17 19:52:50	TheRedPikMayor	I know, im just nervous.
2015-04-17 19:53:30	@Espyo	heh, you don't need to be nervous
2015-04-17 19:53:32	TheRedPikMayor	Also the gas pipes page I added in the trivia section how to take out the pipes without pruple pikmin, except for the gatling groink section.
2015-04-17 19:53:32	@Espyo	we're not judging you
2015-04-17 19:53:39	@Espyo	we won't ban you for doing a mistake or anything
2015-04-17 19:53:44	@Espyo	yeah, I noticed
2015-04-17 19:53:48	@Espyo	I made that trivia into normal content
2015-04-17 19:53:54	@Espyo	because it's more important than just trivia, IMO
2015-04-17 19:53:58	TheRedPikMayor	Thabks
2015-04-17 19:54:08	@Espyo	though I could swear that you couldn't destroy it with punches...
2015-04-17 19:54:15	@Espyo	I might be remembering wrong
2015-04-17 19:54:19	TheRedPikMayor	I think i did with alot of them
2015-04-17 19:54:28	@Espyo	I can check real quick
2015-04-17 19:54:39	@Espyo	Dolphin doesn't take long to boot
2015-04-17 19:54:41	TheRedPikMayor	I could also just get in game and check as well
2015-04-17 19:54:57	TheRedPikMayor	I own the game so I just play it on my gamecube
2015-04-17 19:54:59	@Espyo	if you want, but I'm already here, so
2015-04-17 19:55:03	@Espyo	I own it too
2015-04-17 19:55:08	@Espyo	but getting up, switching disks, etc...
2015-04-17 19:55:13	@Espyo	meh, I'd rather use Dolphin, it's just faster
2015-04-17 19:55:15	TheRedPikMayor	Yeah pretty hard
2015-04-17 19:55:25	TheRedPikMayor	My computer isnt strong enough for dolphin
2015-04-17 19:55:32	@Espyo	mine isn't that great either
2015-04-17 19:55:34	@Espyo	but it runs it okay
2015-04-17 19:55:38	TheRedPikMayor	even though its a thousand dollar gaming laptop
2015-04-17 19:55:44	@Espyo	woah
2015-04-17 19:56:04	@Espyo	well, they've been optimizing in the past few months
2015-04-17 19:56:09	@Espyo	so maybe that could help
2015-04-17 19:56:13	@Espyo	when they release the next big version
2015-04-17 19:56:17	@Espyo	hmm... what Challenge Mode levels have gas pipes?
2015-04-17 19:56:32	Yoshi2	indeed, if you haven't tried dolphin in a longer while, you could give it another try
2015-04-17 19:56:52	@Espyo	Novice Training
2015-04-17 19:57:27	@Espyo	no... punches don't work

2015-04-17 19:58:08	TheRedPikMayor	Or was that with fire geysers? I remember killing hazards with punches

2015-04-17 20:08:26	TheRedPikMayor	The december of 2013
2015-04-17 20:08:31	@Espyo	same
2015-04-17 20:08:34	TheRedPikMayor	1 month after pikmin 3
2015-04-17 20:08:37	@Espyo	I got it September last year
2015-04-17 20:08:40	@Espyo	quite a bit late...
2015-04-17 20:08:42	@Espyo	but still worth it
2015-04-17 20:08:43	@Espyo	easily
2015-04-17 20:08:49	TheRedPikMayor	Its a little short
2015-04-17 20:08:56	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-17 20:09:03	@Espyo	but it's still packed with goodness
2015-04-17 20:09:05	@Espyo	I was pleased
2015-04-17 20:09:05	TheRedPikMayor	And i didnt think the collecting aspect was very good in this one either
2015-04-17 20:09:12	TheRedPikMayor	Fruit isnt interesting
2015-04-17 20:09:13	@Espyo	it was more washed out, yeah
2015-04-17 20:09:20	@Espyo	the concept is nice
2015-04-17 20:09:26	@Espyo	you're solving world hunger, literally
2015-04-17 20:09:33	TheRedPikMayor	Especially if its mainly from the previous game of the series
2015-04-17 20:09:34	@Espyo	and for fruit-lovers, the fruits look really delicious
2015-04-17 20:09:36	@Espyo	but otherwise, eh
2015-04-17 20:09:57	TheRedPikMayor	At least make a game about collecting stuff have interesting stuff
2015-04-17 20:10:13	TheRedPikMayor	I still havent beaten pikmin 3 either
2015-04-17 20:10:23	Yoshi2	I did like the fruit collecting aspect when I was low on food
2015-04-17 20:10:28	TheRedPikMayor	YEah
2015-04-17 20:10:45	TheRedPikMayor	But still, i had almost all the fruit when i got louie.
2015-04-17 20:10:56	TheRedPikMayor	The fruit that was left
2015-04-17 20:11:02	TheRedPikMayor	was the hardest to get fruit
2015-04-17 20:11:32	TheRedPikMayor	But if pikmin 4 is like pikmin 2 mixed with 3,. it would be perfect.
2015-04-17 20:11:41	TheRedPikMayor	Especially with a giant louie robot.
2015-04-17 20:11:47	TheRedPikMayor	as a boss.
2015-04-17 20:12:05	TheRedPikMayor	That shoots lasers
2015-04-17 20:12:13	@Espyo	it would
2015-04-17 20:12:21	@Espyo	the Louie part would be goofy
2015-04-17 20:12:24	@Espyo	but I'd pay to see DLC of it
2015-04-17 20:12:51	TheRedPikMayor	I would think you would fight it with yellow pikmin
2015-04-17 20:12:59	TheRedPikMayor	and short it somehow?
2015-04-17 20:13:24	TheRedPikMayor	Pikmins abilities need to be more fleshed out.
2015-04-17 20:13:42	TheRedPikMayor	I think whites should spew poison at metal.
2015-04-17 20:14:01	TheRedPikMayor	Already canon, because of the shorts.
2015-04-17 20:14:13	@Espyo	half-canon, but yeah
2015-04-17 20:14:26	@Espyo	instead of having more types, they could flesh out the existing ones
2015-04-17 20:14:36	@Espyo	I'd like more types regardless, but...
2015-04-17 20:14:48	TheRedPikMayor	THe current types still do the same stuff
2015-04-17 20:14:57	TheRedPikMayor	except for like 1 getting an upgrade or a downgrade
2015-04-17 20:15:17	TheRedPikMayor	Especially blue pikmin
2015-04-17 20:15:24	TheRedPikMayor	They were USELESS in pikmin 3
2015-04-17 20:15:52	TheRedPikMayor	Almost as useless as yellows in the first game
2015-04-17 20:16:03	@Espyo	they really were
2015-04-17 20:16:05	Yoshi2	were blue pikmin ever not useless?
2015-04-17 20:16:13	TheRedPikMayor	They werent
2015-04-17 20:16:14	@Espyo	they were only needed for underground fruit
2015-04-17 20:16:20	TheRedPikMayor	Ik
2015-04-17 20:16:21	@Espyo	I think you can complete P1 without Blues, period
2015-04-17 20:16:28	TheRedPikMayor	You cant,
2015-04-17 20:16:29	@Espyo	you can use exploits to take the ship parts out of the water
2015-04-17 20:16:34	TheRedPikMayor	Because the libra.
2015-04-17 20:16:41	@Espyo	it's been done
2015-04-17 20:16:42	@Espyo	gimme a sec
2015-04-17 20:16:45	Yoshi2	you'd have to force water sections into the game to make blue pikmin more useful
2015-04-17 20:16:48	@Espyo	in fact, it might be on the Libra article
2015-04-17 20:16:50	@Espyo	[[Libra]]

2015-04-17 20:17:06	@Espyo	yep, here it is, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79o04GEvocI
2015-04-17 20:17:17	@Espyo	they could probably find more stuff for Blues
2015-04-17 20:17:23	@Espyo	that's not necessarily underwater
2015-04-17 20:17:34	TheRedPikMayor	"in THEORY
2015-04-17 20:17:40	@Espyo	like... a current of water that's too strong for all types, but not Blues?
2015-04-17 20:17:43	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-04-17 20:17:47	@Espyo	forgot that's just a "in theory" video
2015-04-17 20:17:48	@Espyo	dammit
2015-04-17 20:17:57	TheRedPikMayor	So yeah
2015-04-17 20:18:01	@Espyo	oh, but wait
2015-04-17 20:18:02	@Espyo	that's with REDS
2015-04-17 20:18:06	TheRedPikMayor	Even the blue pikmin challenge.
2015-04-17 20:18:08	@Espyo	in theory, you can do it with reds
2015-04-17 20:18:18	@Espyo	but regardless, you can see in the video that blues aren't used to activate the geyser
2015-04-17 20:18:22	@Espyo	from there, use reds and yellows
2015-04-17 20:18:53	TheRedPikMayor	Still, its impossible to get the second part at the crash site
2015-04-17 20:19:12	@Espyo	that's also been done
2015-04-17 20:19:15	@Espyo	like I said, exploits
2015-04-17 20:19:19	@Espyo	lying down to push it out
2015-04-17 20:19:34	TheRedPikMayor	But its REALLY easy to get the radiotion canopy on day one at the awakening wood
2015-04-17 20:19:36	TheRedPikMayor	I mean
2015-04-17 20:19:42	TheRedPikMayor	arent they the same really
2015-04-17 20:20:01	TheRedPikMayor	the awakening wood and the forest of hope?
2015-04-17 20:20:12	TheRedPikMayor	where you find blues is the armored cannon beatle arena
2015-04-17 20:20:29	@Espyo	there we go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB2E8pCVqco
2015-04-17 20:20:31	@Espyo	no blues needed
2015-04-17 20:20:43	@Espyo	yeah, they're the same spot
2015-04-17 20:21:15	TheRedPikMayor	But remembering the names
2015-04-17 20:21:19	TheRedPikMayor	is so frustrating
2015-04-17 20:21:25	@Espyo	hehe
2015-04-17 20:21:26	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-17 20:21:31	TheRedPikMayor	the forest of hope is the pikmin version
2015-04-17 20:21:38	TheRedPikMayor	because its his last hope
2015-04-17 20:21:45	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-17 20:21:54	TheRedPikMayor	Also i need to get the last part in the forest navel
2015-04-17 20:21:55	TheRedPikMayor	But
2015-04-17 20:21:58	TheRedPikMayor	those
2015-04-17 20:22:00	TheRedPikMayor	freaking
2015-04-17 20:22:05	TheRedPikMayor	wollywogs
2015-04-17 20:22:16	TheRedPikMayor	I tried luring them away
2015-04-17 20:22:25	TheRedPikMayor	But no
2015-04-17 20:22:53	TheRedPikMayor	Any good exploits for it?
2015-04-17 20:22:59	@Espyo	just rush at them with 100 Pikmin
2015-04-17 20:23:06	TheRedPikMayor	Im playing the wii version btw
2015-04-17 20:23:13	@Espyo	wait, you mean the ship part on the water?
2015-04-17 20:23:17	TheRedPikMayor	Yeah
2015-04-17 20:23:46	@Espyo	well, if you don't mind sacrificing Pikmin, bring 100 Blues and just swarm the piece
2015-04-17 20:23:50	@Espyo	they'll bring it back as soon as possible
2015-04-17 20:23:57	@Espyo	and only 5 or so will be caught by the Wollywogs
2015-04-17 20:24:05	TheRedPikMayor	Seems fair
2015-04-17 20:24:16	TheRedPikMayor	But WHY do so many pikmin need to carry it
2015-04-17 20:24:31	TheRedPikMayor	But isnt there the laying down to push it exploit

2015-04-17 20:38:08	TheRedPikMayor	lost 10 pikmim
2015-04-17 20:38:33	TheRedPikMayor	Oh add a new glitch
2015-04-17 20:38:47	TheRedPikMayor	if pikmin are lifting a object thats high up
2015-04-17 20:38:57	TheRedPikMayor	it can pass over olimar if hes lying down
2015-04-17 20:39:37	TheRedPikMayor	or decapitate him apparently
2015-04-17 20:39:44	--	UltraMario is now known as UltraMarth
2015-04-17 20:39:45	TheRedPikMayor	it might just itshowing his head
2015-04-17 20:40:11	@Espyo	heh
2015-04-17 20:40:13	TheRedPikMayor	14 more parts
2015-04-17 20:40:35	TheRedPikMayor	should i wait for the goolix day or the mamuta day to go to the landing site?
2015-04-17 20:41:12	TheRedPikMayor	oh
2015-04-17 20:41:26	TheRedPikMayor	a few pikmin sprouted after my beady battle
2015-04-17 20:42:13	@Espyo	Mamuta is safer
2015-04-17 20:42:17	@Espyo	but I think it gives less reward
2015-04-17 20:42:23	@Espyo	eh, but it flowers your Pikmin for free
2015-04-17 20:42:25	@Espyo	so that's always nice
2015-04-17 20:42:42	TheRedPikMayor	If anything pikmin ai should have them avoid going near hazards sometimes
2015-04-17 20:43:01	TheRedPikMayor	only if its like a huge group of pikmin near a hazard not in a group
2015-04-17 20:43:31	TheRedPikMayor	So it isnt stupid
2015-04-17 20:44:17	TheRedPikMayor	Also, is pikmin new play control have the same graphics as the gamecube pikmin?
2015-04-17 20:44:33	@Espyo	I think it's exactly the same graphics
2015-04-17 20:44:38	@Espyo	maybe slight updates here and there
2015-04-17 20:45:16	TheRedPikMayor	Lazy nintendo
2015-04-17 20:45:46	TheRedPikMayor	The only updated things are the pikmin and olimar and some enemies, wich are now the pikmin 2 models
2015-04-17 20:45:54	@Espyo	eh, I'd rather they re-release it on the Wii so more people could play it rather than them giving up because they wanted to update the graphics
2015-04-17 20:46:21	TheRedPikMayor	Yeah
2015-04-17 20:46:29	TheRedPikMayor	If anything
2015-04-17 20:46:33	TheRedPikMayor	its not a remake
2015-04-17 20:46:34	TheRedPikMayor	its a port
2015-04-17 20:46:37	@Espyo	right, that
2015-04-17 20:46:37	@Espyo	my bad
2015-04-17 20:46:56	Yoshi2	well, they never claimed it was more than a port
2015-04-17 20:46:56	TheRedPikMayor	Most likely before pikmin 4
2015-04-17 20:47:07	TheRedPikMayor	they will remake them into hd games.
2015-04-17 20:47:23	TheRedPikMayor	as one game
2015-04-17 20:47:24	TheRedPikMayor	like 
2015-04-17 20:47:30	TheRedPikMayor	Pikmin the original sage
2015-04-17 20:47:32	TheRedPikMayor	saga
2015-04-17 20:47:41	Yoshi2	original saga sounds weird
2015-04-17 20:48:00	TheRedPikMayor	The reason why we didnt get pikmin 2 ported to the wii at first
2015-04-17 20:48:09	TheRedPikMayor	was because of the copyright
2015-04-17 20:48:22	TheRedPikMayor	of the stuff in the game running out for nintendo to use in america
2015-04-17 20:48:38	TheRedPikMayor	I believe
2015-04-17 20:48:43	Yoshi2	probably
2015-04-17 20:48:47	Yoshi2	what did they do about it?
2015-04-17 20:48:59	TheRedPikMayor	They got the rights again
2015-04-17 20:49:25	TheRedPikMayor	Same reason later punchout nes game carts didnt use mike tyson

2015-04-17 21:18:04	@Espyo	the Positron Generator is the one inside the clamclamp

2015-04-17 21:19:51	@Espyo	like, what parts change the ship's appearance and which ones don't
2015-04-17 21:19:56	TheRedPikMayor	Isnt the generator basically a house or something?
2015-04-17 21:20:05	@Espyo	looks more like a helmet doohickey
2015-04-17 21:20:29	TheRedPikMayor	ecause i believe that some green tubing connects to the iodium jets
2015-04-17 21:21:49	TheRedPikMayor	Yeah some of it connects to the jets

2015-04-17 21:26:59	TheRedPikMayor	Im also wondering which game has the shortest days? im leaning towars pikmin 1 or 2, since pikmin 3 days can be quite long.

2015-04-17 21:27:46	TheRedPikMayor	According to them, wich one does it seem to be?
2015-04-17 21:28:13	TheRedPikMayor	Im betting towards pikmin 2, but you cant get much done on pikmin 1 days either..
2015-04-17 21:28:38	Miles	Pikmin 1 is 13:30 and Pikmin 2 is 13:00
2015-04-17 21:28:49	Miles	I'd LIKE to say that 3 is also 13:00
2015-04-17 21:28:57	TheRedPikMayor	SO pikmin 2 \/3
2015-04-17 21:29:34	@Espyo	but what about NTSC vs PAL?
2015-04-17 21:29:37	@Espyo	and GC vs Wii?

2015-04-17 21:30:41	TheRedPikMayor	We were really wrong
2015-04-17 21:31:34	Miles	PAL would be over 16 minutes, does anyone edit it to say that?

2015-04-17 21:37:49	TheRedPikMayor	How many does it take to kill with bomb rocks?
2015-04-17 21:38:10	@Espyo	I'm just trying to find justification for the thousands of times we've had on the article
2015-04-17 21:38:25	@Espyo	I don't think you can feasibly kill it with bombs
2015-04-17 21:38:26	@Espyo	if at all
2015-04-17 21:38:36	@Espyo	body shots cause less damage than head shots
2015-04-17 21:38:41	@Espyo	so I'd bet around 10 or more
2015-04-17 21:38:56	@Espyo	unless you time it so it explodes when it's coming out
2015-04-17 21:39:26	TheRedPikMayor	Ok, easiest way to kill it?
2015-04-17 21:39:45	@Espyo	wait until it gets stuck, then swarm it
2015-04-17 21:41:32	TheRedPikMayor	with only red flowers?
2015-04-17 21:42:04	TheRedPikMayor	well thats an obvious question

2015-04-18 16:49:19	TheRedPikMayor	I wish there was a glitch where he got stuck in the stun animation, and then he couldnt do any attacks.

2015-04-18 17:18:15	Yoshi2	J would have a field day if he looked at this code
2015-04-18 17:18:53	@Espyo	I bet
2015-04-18 17:19:37	Yoshi2	CamelCase for function and file names? Suuuuure, why not
2015-04-18 17:59:11	Yoshi2	this will be the first time I use the fancy function from the IDE that looks
2015-04-18 17:59:27	Yoshi2	for references to the function or file I'm using in the other parts of the code
2015-04-18 18:05:08	@Espyo	hmm
2015-04-18 18:05:09	@Espyo	is it any good?
2015-04-18 18:05:19	@Espyo	none of those functions from any IDE I ever used worked right
2015-04-18 18:06:27	Yoshi2	well, in intellij it is possible to preview the references it will change, so it is less likely that it will go crazy with that
2015-04-18 18:06:46	Yoshi2	it is possible that it doesn't get all references, but I will have to see about that when I test the code again
2015-04-18 18:07:39	Yoshi2	it is more complicated with function names though, I think
2015-04-18 18:07:55	Yoshi2	it is much simpler if you are only renaming the file 
2015-04-18 18:08:12	Yoshi2	because with functions you will need to do a Search+Replace yourself

2015-04-18 20:41:41	@J	I probably forgot to say, but I've been away for about a week
2015-04-18 20:41:47	@J	...back now
2015-04-18 20:42:33	Yoshi2	wb J 
2015-04-18 20:43:05	Yoshi2	it didn't feel like you were away for a week
2015-04-18 20:44:55	Yoshi2	that might be good or bad
2015-04-18 20:51:06	@J	hmm
2015-04-18 21:02:59	@J	we use IntelliJ at work, for JavaScript
2015-04-18 21:03:21	@J	I imagine it works quite well for Java, but JavaScript is a hard language to do the things it tries to do
2015-04-18 21:03:45	@J	I use the Vim plugin for editing, which is a bit weird sometimes but mostly not bad
2015-04-18 21:06:08	@J	the Python support is limited to 2 last I checked, though, which is a problem
2015-04-18 21:07:28	Yoshi2	I have no particular issues writing Python 3 stuff in intellij
2015-04-18 21:12:49	@J	hmm, I tried with the standard Python plugin and it just complains about all the syntax
2015-04-18 21:12:54	@J	like print isn't a function
2015-04-18 21:13:18	@Espyo	oh, you didn't say
2015-04-18 21:13:19	@Espyo	welcome back
2015-04-18 21:13:51	@J	hi
2015-04-18 21:16:08	Yoshi2	maybe you didn't set up the plugin correctly? I think it complained about all sorts of syntax issues before I set the path to the interpreter
2015-04-18 21:17:14	@J	oh, maybe if you set it to a Python 3 executable it chooses the correct version
2015-04-18 21:17:22	@J	should really support multiple versions, though
2015-04-18 21:17:25	@J	(maybe it does?)
2015-04-18 21:18:04	@J	I look very hard, I guess - I don't use Python much at work, and don't use IDEs at home
2015-04-18 21:21:35	@J	*didn't look

2015-04-21 23:53:50	@Espyo		
2015-04-21 23:53:50	@Espyo	I have been doing benchmarks myself, and vector.at is much slower than using an iterator, however using vector[i] is much faster than using an iterator.
2015-04-21 23:53:52	@Espyo	welp, that confirms it

2015-04-22 21:34:54	@J	I might have mentioned before that I have a script to make an RSS feed from YouTube subscriptions
2015-04-22 21:35:09	@J	well, apparently support for the API version I'm using is ending
2015-04-22 21:35:33	@J	somehow YouTube did some magic and I actually got a video in my feed about the change, which was kind of impressive
2015-04-22 21:36:12	@J	anyway, I started porting it and apparently I need to register for Google's development stuff or requests are heavily limited
2015-04-22 21:36:38	@J	and if I want to run it from a user's subscriptions, either they need to be public or the authentication is a lot more complicated than before
2015-04-22 21:37:43	@Espyo	oh yeah, I've been hearing about something or another videos about APIs ending something
2015-04-22 21:37:56	@Espyo	eesh, that's ridiculous
2015-04-22 21:38:05	@Espyo	one step closer to closing user customizations further
2015-04-22 21:42:55	@J	too lazy to do the authentication stuff, so I'll allow specifying the channels in a config file instead
2015-04-22 21:43:44	@J	...accidentally just killed everything and got logged out
2015-04-22 21:43:51	@J	really don't know why I have that shortcut enabled
2015-04-22 21:45:05	@Espyo	heh

2015-04-24 19:13:18	Xtarhaven	what's been going on since I was gone
2015-04-24 19:13:32	UltraMario	also cuz i was bamperstamped on my old miiverse account
2015-04-24 19:13:34	UltraMario	oh
2015-04-24 19:13:44	UltraMario	well yoshi2 just remember i wanted to add him on miiverse
2015-04-24 19:13:45	UltraMario	:p
2015-04-24 19:14:35	Xtarhaven	oh yeah didn't you want to ad me on the wiiu Ultra? I totally forgot :v
2015-04-24 19:15:13	UltraMario	oh
2015-04-24 19:15:15	UltraMario	:|
2015-04-24 19:15:16	UltraMario	well uh
2015-04-24 19:15:18	Yoshi2	I've heard that the 200cc mode is in MK8 now, so that's a reason to turn on the wii u again
2015-04-24 19:15:47	Yoshi2	~~~ Xtarhaven it was an illusion, ultramario never wanted to add you on the wii u ~~~~~
2015-04-24 19:15:47	UltraMario	i can't really accept friend requests on my wii u right now cuz i've kind of got it in limbo at the moment
2015-04-24 19:15:48	UltraMario	:p
2015-04-24 19:16:05	Xtarhaven	oh, ah well
2015-04-24 19:16:28	UltraMario	also I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH MARTIO KART 8 BECAUSE IT DECIDED TO STOP WORKING ON ME RIGHT WHEN THE FIRST DLC CAME OUT
2015-04-24 19:16:28	UltraMario	;_;
2015-04-24 19:16:59	Yoshi2	ow
2015-04-24 19:17:05	Yoshi2	poor you :<
2015-04-24 19:17:15	UltraMario	the reason i say my wii u is currently in limbo is because, well
2015-04-24 19:17:15	Xtarhaven	yikes man, that's the worst
2015-04-24 19:17:50	UltraMario	it's being really wonky lately with reading my smash bros disc, and it takes like maybe 15 insert/ejects to get the game to boot up
2015-04-24 19:17:57	UltraMario	only to have more disc read errors and
2015-04-24 19:18:03	UltraMario	do more inserting ejecting
2015-04-24 19:18:16	Yoshi2	sounds like an issue with the console
2015-04-24 19:18:27	UltraMario	it was then i that i caught onto the fact that there was dust in the vents :P
2015-04-24 19:18:56	UltraMario	and had to go on the nintendo online store to get some disc reader lens cleaning kit thing for like 10 dollars
2015-04-24 19:19:25	UltraMario	but i also have to get the dust out too and clean the dust that was around my wii u area, otherwise it'll just be the same
2015-04-24 19:19:59	UltraMario	but i need to find a vacuum somewhere in the house with a soft brush end thing to get it out
2015-04-24 19:20:15	UltraMario	the support page doesn't really say anything else i could use besides that
2015-04-24 19:20:17	Xtarhaven	hm, sounds like a lot
2015-04-24 19:20:28	UltraMario	:p
2015-04-24 19:21:12	Xtarhaven	oh one of the pikipedia chat members found the first unused enemy in Pikmin 3
2015-04-24 19:21:42	Yoshi2	I've never found the support booklet to be very useful
2015-04-24 19:21:57	Yoshi2	Xtarhaven: an unused enemy? woooohoooo!
2015-04-24 19:22:02	Yoshi2	I love unused stuff
2015-04-24 19:22:12	UltraMario	well it was from the online site actually
2015-04-24 19:22:20	UltraMario	im not sure it was in the wii u manual
2015-04-24 19:22:55	Xtarhaven	yeah it found in Gmod because someone ripped the models from pikmin 3, it was another variant of the bulborb
2015-04-24 19:23:20	Xtarhaven	almost a prototype of the whiptounge bulborb
2015-04-24 19:23:38	Xtarhaven	it has the brown skin and white body
2015-04-24 19:23:49	UltraMario	i found some smash bros wii u models and hyrule warriors models also off of gmod
2015-04-24 19:24:00	UltraMario	i think people are finally getting their first step into getting wii u data
2015-04-24 19:24:45	Yoshi2	"first step"
2015-04-24 19:25:05	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure people have figured out how to read the data from the wii u games
2015-04-24 19:25:06	UltraMario	well what would you like me to call it?
2015-04-24 19:25:06	UltraMario	:P
2015-04-24 19:25:15	UltraMario	I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS
2015-04-24 19:25:28	UltraMario	BUT I NEVER REALLY SAW WII U MODELS BEING RIPPED UNTIL THEN
2015-04-24 19:26:30	Xtarhaven	the different thing about it was it had black outlines instead of a full spot, and it has yellow eyes and white pupils, and it's spots looked indented instead of them popping out 
2015-04-24 19:28:11	Yoshi2	UltraMario: if you asked me a few months ago, I wouldn't have believed that people managed to rip any kind of data from the wii u games
2015-04-24 19:28:43	UltraMario	well i meant
2015-04-24 19:28:48	Yoshi2	and yet, somebody managed to rip the pikmin 3 music
2015-04-24 19:28:48	UltraMario	models in particular
2015-04-24 19:28:53	UltraMario	well
2015-04-24 19:28:56	UltraMario	music is different
2015-04-24 19:29:14	Yoshi2	how so
2015-04-24 19:29:50	Yoshi2	and with rip I don't mean record the music as it is played by the console
2015-04-24 19:30:10	UltraMario	yes i know
2015-04-24 19:30:15	UltraMario	but i mean like
2015-04-24 19:30:29	Yoshi2	if you can read one file, I'm pretty sure you can read them all
2015-04-24 19:31:00	UltraMario	idk it's kinda hard to elaborate on but not until recently have i saw sites like models resource, and people importing the models into things like gmod and sfm
2015-04-24 19:32:01	UltraMario	i mean music is a different thing cuz like just cuz someone managed to rip an entire pikmin soundtrack doesn't mean he'd really want to bother with other stuff like porting models
2015-04-24 19:32:26	Yoshi2	I do find it odd how quickly people catch on and get the models loaded in other games/tools
2015-04-24 19:33:19	UltraMario	soundtracks are usually uploaded near the release of a game
2015-04-24 19:33:20	UltraMario	:p
2015-04-24 19:35:45	Yoshi2	sure, but to upload the actual sound files you need to be able to read the disc format
2015-04-24 19:36:13	Yoshi2	which people managed to figure out a while ago
2015-04-24 19:41:46	UltraMario	yes
2015-04-24 19:42:06	UltraMario	but i mean still, it seems to be more common to see soundtracks ripped than ingame models
2015-04-24 19:42:25	Xtarhaven	uh hello? Amazing discovery here!
2015-04-24 19:43:21	Xtarhaven	yeah it found in Gmod because someone ripped the models from pikmin 3, it was another variant of the bulborb,lmost a prototype of the whiptounge bulborb, t has the brown skin and white body
2015-04-24 19:43:22	Xtarhaven	the different thing about it was it had black outlines instead of a full spot, and it has yellow eyes and white pupils, and it's spots looked indented instead of them popping out

2015-04-24 20:19:35	Xtarhaven	An old idea that I still use, was a water bulborb, It had pale skin, a blue body, and green spots.
2015-04-24 20:20:09	Xtarhaven	It also had a long tongue that would trap pikmin
2015-04-24 20:20:51	@Espyo	hm
2015-04-24 20:20:53	Xtarhaven	it would wander around the water soaking up moisture with it's tongue
2015-04-24 20:23:14	@Espyo	that's actually pretty funny
2015-04-24 20:23:16	@Espyo	and kinda cute
2015-04-24 20:24:02	Xtarhaven	I also has this bulborb that would sleep in dark areas, it would have bioluminescent eye-like spots that would scare pikmin if you approach from behind
2015-04-24 21:14:31	Xtarhaven	"I don't think we need a water Bulborb since we already have Water Dumples where are literally just prehistoric Bulborbs" - Luther
2015-04-24 21:14:52	Xtarhaven	I asked luther about the water bulborb, this was his critism
2015-04-24 21:18:12	Xtarhaven	what do you think espyo, does he have a point? At least, I think he does
2015-04-24 21:30:19	@Espyo	well, if the water bulborb is done original, then I think it could replace dumples
2015-04-24 21:30:28	@Espyo	though I'd rather see more diverse and unique enemies, tbh
2015-04-24 21:32:13	Xtarhaven	ugh, please never say "tbh" around me, I've seen it waay to much on tumblr, and you know how tumblr is :v
2015-04-24 21:32:41	Yoshi2	go get your privilege checked, etc.etc.etc.
2015-04-24 21:32:46	Xtarhaven	it's my triggger you shitlord
2015-04-24 21:33:17	Xtarhaven	cis scum...uh... uwu
2015-04-24 21:33:55	Yoshi2	I have heard a lot about that stuff
2015-04-24 21:33:57	@Espyo	lol
2015-04-24 21:34:08	@Espyo	typical tumblr
2015-04-24 21:34:25	@Espyo	I just subscribe to pages that share specific stuff instead of sharing stories and such
2015-04-24 21:34:28	@Espyo	otherwise... oh boy
2015-04-24 21:34:33	@Espyo	and even then I only subscribe via RSS
2015-04-24 21:34:36	@Espyo	ain't taking part in that website
2015-04-24 21:34:56	Yoshi2	RSS is something I see in a lot of places, but I have no idea how to use it
2015-04-24 21:35:11	Xtarhaven	do you Like and Comment when you Subscribe? :^)
2015-04-24 21:37:25	Xtarhaven	anyway, what would you consider a good water bulborb?
2015-04-24 21:37:55	@Espyo	more or less how you described
2015-04-24 21:37:58	@Espyo	maybe more original stuff
2015-04-24 21:38:15	@Espyo	Yoshi2: you need an RSS aggregator
2015-04-24 21:38:22	@Espyo	you just give it sources to save
2015-04-24 21:38:24	Xtarhaven	well pikmin has it's fair share of recolors anyway
2015-04-24 21:38:30	@Espyo	and every time there's a news post and such, it gets saved like an e-mail service
2015-04-24 21:38:33	@Espyo	you read them whenever
2015-04-24 21:38:38	@Espyo	also there is no good RSS aggregator

2015-04-24 21:38:39	@Espyo	ever
2015-04-24 21:38:44	@Espyo	Xtarhaven: yep, it does
2015-04-24 21:38:53	Yoshi2	I wonder if the player character could have non-pikmin friends in one of the next games

2015-04-24 21:39:34	Xtarhaven	though the orange bulborb does change it up with it's more menacing colors
2015-04-24 21:41:34	Xtarhaven	I think someone else on the chat had a water bulborb idea, was kinda like the skeeter skater mob where it would shoot water, though they didn't say what it looked like
2015-04-24 21:45:01	Xtarhaven	I remembered some bulborb sprites I made, the water bulborb has cyan spots instead of green
2015-04-24 21:45:40	Xtarhaven	there's this green one, I think it was a smaller version of the green bulblord
2015-04-24 21:47:58	Xtarhaven	there's also a spotless bulbear, I remember I changed it so the spotted ones sleep like in Pikmin 1, and the spotless ones roam
2015-04-24 21:50:16	Xtarhaven	there's also "I also has this bulborb that would sleep in dark areas, it would have bioluminescent eye-like spots that would scare pikmin if you approach from behind"
2015-04-24 21:51:27	@Espyo	yep
2015-04-24 21:52:06	Xtarhaven	it's body was all black like the hairy bulborb is all white, it has purple eye spots with red lines to look like pupils, with the real eyes having the same colors  
2015-04-24 21:56:21	Xtarhaven	there's also this gold one on the side with brown skin and black spots, I think I remember making it faster & rarer then regular bulborbs

2015-04-24 22:11:15	@J	it's not bad
2015-04-24 22:12:39	@Espyo	I recently moved to Feedly
2015-04-24 22:12:51	@Espyo	a website, not an application or Firefox addon
2015-04-24 22:12:53	@Espyo	it looks okay
2015-04-24 22:13:04	@Espyo	oh hey, I remember seeing those sprites
2015-04-24 22:15:50	Xtarhaven	yeah they're  mattdog's
2015-04-24 22:16:28	@J	I never bothered looking at the website options because maybe I won't have internet access
2015-04-24 22:19:48	@Espyo	yeah
2015-04-24 22:19:57	@Espyo	but I just couldn't find anything else that works well
2015-04-24 22:20:05	@Espyo	quite a few of them are good... but have some fatal flaw
2015-04-24 22:20:28	@Espyo	my first one, Digest (or is Digest the name of the fork?), was ultra-slow while fetching and reading
2015-04-24 22:20:50	@Espyo	my previous one, Newsfox, had no automatic fetching
2015-04-24 22:21:06	@Espyo	and everything else I tried searching as an addon just had horrible reviews and such
2015-04-24 22:21:10	@Espyo	and I really wanted a Firefox addon
2015-04-24 22:21:27	@Espyo	I don't fancy downloading a program in which half of it is yet another HTML5 renderer

2015-04-25 20:57:01	@J	what
2015-04-25 20:57:26	@J	it just hovers out of the way without even waking up
2015-04-25 21:00:17	@Espyo	I DID lobotomize it
2015-04-25 21:00:30	@Espyo	to make it easier to debug the Pikmin AI without the enemy AI in the way
2015-04-25 21:00:39	@Espyo	but my old attacking code had some stuff for knockback
2015-04-25 21:00:44	@Espyo	for when enemies shake Pikmin off, you know?
2015-04-25 21:00:50	@Espyo	I tried to check if it worked the other way around
2015-04-25 21:00:52	@Espyo	and it just did
2015-04-25 21:00:54	@Espyo	and I just lost it
2015-04-25 21:15:18	@J	the way it moves seems wrong though
2015-04-25 21:15:25	@J	should slow down over time, not just suddenly stop
2015-04-25 21:15:51	@J	unless it's meant to be in the air, I guess, but it doesn't look like it is
2015-04-25 21:17:18	@Espyo	yeah, it's not perfected
2015-04-25 21:17:42	@Espyo	I haven't revamped this yet, but in older versions, the Pikmin being knocked down with that code looked fine
2015-04-25 21:19:30	@J	I guess they don't go as far, so you can't tell as much
2015-04-25 21:20:07	@Espyo	mhm
2015-04-25 21:20:20	@Espyo	plus they change to an animation where they actually lie down, so there's that
2015-04-25 21:23:49	@J	yeah, I like how the Bulborb just sleeps through it

2015-04-26 12:28:49	Testyo	so you say 'they sound like horns, one high- and people reverse-engineering the entire console...s
2015-04-26 12:29:19	@J	what sort of sentence is that
2015-04-26 12:31:39	@Espyo	hi
2015-04-26 12:31:44	@Espyo	Testyo: lm
2015-04-26 12:31:44	Testyo	I said so you say 'they sound like horns, one high- and people reverse-engineering the entire console...s because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages and people reverse-engineering the entire console...s and so you say 'they sound like horns, one high- and one low-pitched', or something. They were joined by the common word and.
2015-04-26 12:32:12	@Espyo	I think the second one is an old sketch for explaining the whistles on the wiki

2015-04-26 15:47:46	@Espyo	WHAT?!
2015-04-26 15:47:52	@Espyo	I somehow turned the Pikmin against each other on the engine!
2015-04-26 15:50:09	Yoshi2	pshhhh
2015-04-26 15:50:13	Yoshi2	that is a feature, not a bug
2015-04-26 15:51:00	@Espyo	see, here's the thing
2015-04-26 15:51:01	@Espyo	it's BOTH
2015-04-26 15:51:06	@Espyo	I've always wanted to allow infighting

2015-04-26 15:52:32	@Espyo	...they're actually killing themselves
2015-04-26 15:54:00	Yoshi2	the pikmin series could be so much more serious and dramatic if you introduced different tribes that fought eachother
2015-04-26 15:55:00	@Espyo	ouch
2015-04-26 15:55:04	@Espyo	my engine will totally allow that
2015-04-26 15:57:07	@Espyo	okay, so telling them to go after the enemy after they strike it once
2015-04-26 15:57:08	@Espyo	...
2015-04-26 15:57:14	@Espyo	somehow means "hurt yourselves until death"

2015-05-01 12:08:25	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-05-01 12:08:26	Testyo	I'll do the template, but only when it's ready
2015-05-01 12:16:16	@Espyo	hi
2015-05-01 12:19:36	Yoshi2	technically, I'm supposed to have two partners who I work with on the homework in the OS and system programs course
2015-05-01 12:19:54	Yoshi2	but I haven't heard from them since last week :<
2015-05-01 12:21:36	Yoshi2	their loss, I guess
2015-05-01 12:21:41	Yoshi2	¯\(ツ)/¯  
2015-05-01 12:21:47	@Espyo	lol, get used to it
2015-05-01 12:21:58	@Espyo	if there's one thing that's a reality in the entire planet
2015-05-01 12:22:06	@Espyo	is that during partner projects
2015-05-01 12:22:14	@Espyo	at least ONCE in your lifetime, you'll have one parter MIA
2015-05-01 12:22:25	@Espyo	and then they appear at the end to reap the grade
2015-05-01 12:22:34	Yoshi2	that appears to be the case
2015-05-01 12:23:27	Yoshi2	I hope they will feel VERY awkward when they look in their emails shortly before deadline and see my reply from 3 days ago
2015-05-01 12:24:48	Yoshi2	luckily, I don't have to depend on them
2015-05-01 12:25:16	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-05-01 12:25:25	@Espyo	problem is if they bog you down during the presentation
2015-05-01 12:25:36	Yoshi2	that does suck
2015-05-01 12:25:36	@Espyo	normally they shouldn't
2015-05-01 12:25:56	@Espyo	the teachers should see you speak about it like it's your breakfast, and should see the others go like "uh... uh... yeah, what he said"
2015-05-01 12:26:06	@Espyo	so bam, free grades
2015-05-01 12:26:09	@Espyo	but if not...
2015-05-01 12:26:36	Yoshi2	"I'm just here because I have to. I'd love to be somewhere else right now"
2015-05-01 12:26:45	@Espyo	hehe
2015-05-01 12:27:19	Yoshi2	well, no presentations this semester afaik, so I should be save for now
2015-05-01 12:27:26	@Espyo	oh
2015-05-01 12:28:37	Yoshi2	*safe
2015-05-01 12:30:19	Yoshi2	I have heard some horror tales from some people I know who study in different unis
2015-05-01 12:31:20	Yoshi2	in one case, a guy in his group seems to be trying his best to sabotage the project 
2015-05-01 12:31:30	Yoshi2	because he wants lots of git branches for himself instead of using the 1-2 branches already set up
2015-05-01 12:32:44	@Espyo	whaa?
2015-05-01 12:33:19	Yoshi2	exactly
2015-05-01 12:33:42	Yoshi2	person 1, who is the person I know, has set up a git repo for his group's project
2015-05-01 12:34:19	Yoshi2	person 2 is also in that group, and seems to prefer using various branches for specific features
2015-05-01 12:34:40	Yoshi2	in one case, person 2 created a branch in which the only change was a change to .gitignore
2015-05-01 12:38:49	@Espyo	hmm
2015-05-01 12:39:40	Yoshi2	managing many different branches is a pain, as far as I can tell
2015-05-01 12:41:01	@Espyo	more or less, yeah
2015-05-01 12:42:19	Yoshi2	I'll need to ask my friend if he had any success with talking that second person out of doing that silly thing
2015-05-01 12:44:22	Yoshi2	Testyo: tell me something
2015-05-01 12:44:23	Testyo	and then I give a pretty good estimate of when he's going to release it he has less than 4 hours

2015-05-01 16:34:50	Yoshi2	I didn't know shell programming could be so much fun
2015-05-01 16:35:01	@Espyo	depends on the Os
2015-05-01 16:35:02	@Espyo	*OS
2015-05-01 16:35:20	Yoshi2	flavor of linux
2015-05-01 16:35:24	@Espyo	on windows, believe you me, jamming a screwdriver on your toenails is at least eight times more fun
2015-05-01 16:35:59	Yoshi2	somehow, I expected a toenails analogy
2015-05-01 16:36:38	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-01 16:36:47	@Espyo	either I'm predictable, or windows is just toenail-like

2015-05-01 16:37:32	Yoshi2	probably the latter
2015-05-01 16:37:40	Yoshi2	lots of toenail analogies concerning windows

2015-05-01 16:39:55	Yoshi2	but it was not about a screwdriver
2015-05-01 16:40:14	Yoshi2	I think it was about prying up the toe nails
2015-05-01 16:40:25	@Espyo	I think it was me...

2015-05-01 16:48:18	Yoshi2	I definitely heard it once before

2015-05-01 20:28:00	@Espyo	don't think it is

2015-05-01 20:28:11	@Espyo	you came just in time
2015-05-01 20:28:14	@Espyo	I was just about to assume this works
2015-05-01 20:28:16	@Espyo	but now I can be sure
2015-05-01 20:28:22	@Espyo	you know that thing with the Pikipedia page analyzer
2015-05-01 20:28:28	@Espyo	and how it didn't scroll to the selection on your browser?
2015-05-01 20:28:37	@Espyo	I worked up a hacky way to do it
2015-05-01 20:28:57	@Espyo	but hey, guess what, getting Chrome to cooperate is like trying to get a mule to swim
2015-05-01 20:29:09	@Espyo	so I'll send you the script, and you can check if it scrolls, now
2015-05-01 20:29:18	@J	sure
2015-05-01 20:29:23	@Espyo	thanks
2015-05-01 20:29:29	@Espyo	it's pretty simple
2015-05-01 20:29:42	@Espyo	it just replaced the textbox with all the text before the selection
2015-05-01 20:29:50	@J	whaa
2015-05-01 20:29:51	@Espyo	so the end of the textbox would be where the selection would start
2015-05-01 20:29:58	@Espyo	then it scrolls to 9999
2015-05-01 20:30:02	@Espyo	which the browser just puts at the bottom
2015-05-01 20:30:05	@Espyo	and then reapplies the text
2015-05-01 20:30:11	@Espyo	so it should stay scrolled in the right place
2015-05-01 20:30:16	@J	what if a page has more than 9999 lines?
2015-05-01 20:30:25	@Espyo	it's in px
2015-05-01 20:30:28	@Espyo	but still not a problem
2015-05-01 20:30:31	@Espyo	because *99999
2015-05-01 20:30:36	@Espyo	I said 9999 accidentally
2015-05-01 20:30:46	@Espyo	if it has more than 99999px, I think Pikan's the least of our problems
2015-05-01 20:30:57	@Espyo	then again I might be underestimating 99999px
2015-05-01 20:31:06	@Espyo	I think our longest page is Olimar's Voyage Log
2015-05-01 20:31:12	@Espyo	so it'd be interesting to try there, if you could
2015-05-01 20:31:16	@Espyo	just add "wikia" to the end
2015-05-01 20:31:20	@Espyo	but first, I have to send it
2015-05-01 20:31:41	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikipedia_analyzer.user.js
2015-05-01 20:35:17	@J	wow, it works
2015-05-01 20:35:23	@J	hackiest thing ever, but it works
2015-05-01 20:35:28	@J	now try IE
2015-05-01 20:35:29	@Espyo	amazing
2015-05-01 20:35:33	@Espyo	I will most certainly not
2015-05-01 20:35:37	@Espyo	I value my life, thank you
2015-05-01 20:35:48	@Espyo	plus I'm not even sure where I can find IE on my OS
2015-05-01 20:35:52	@Espyo	I've removed all shortcuts to it
2015-05-01 20:35:58	@Espyo	heck, bigger problem
2015-05-01 20:36:07	@Espyo	how in the world do I run scritps on IE if they aren't a part of the page?
2015-05-01 20:36:11	@Espyo	*scripts
2015-05-01 20:36:16	@Espyo	I think I'll wait until this is on the wiki
2015-05-01 20:36:22	@Espyo	...which should be today, if you're telling me it works
2015-05-01 20:36:30	@Espyo	oh, what about "wikia" at the end of [[Olimar's Voyage Log]]?
2015-05-01 20:36:30	Testyo	"Olimar's_Voyage_Log" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Olimar's_Voyage_Log
2015-05-01 20:37:22	@J	it works
2015-05-01 20:37:24	@J	although...
2015-05-01 20:37:37	@J	check #122/123 on that page
2015-05-01 20:37:42	@Espyo	will do
2015-05-01 20:37:44	@J	that's pretty messed up
2015-05-01 20:37:45	@Espyo	with or without the wikia?
2015-05-01 20:37:50	@J	without
2015-05-01 20:38:08	@Espyo	...oh wow
2015-05-01 20:39:28	@J	so yeah, you should make the stuff that actually does the checks easy to extend, and provide a load of helpers
2015-05-01 20:39:35	@J	and I'm sure lots of other wikis will be interested
2015-05-01 20:39:37	@Espyo	 /\[\[([^\|]*_[^\|]*|.*_.*\|.+)\]\]/gm
2015-05-01 20:39:42	@Espyo	don't think it should be matching
2015-05-01 20:39:52	@Espyo	there are some helpers
2015-05-01 20:40:00	@Espyo	it's hard to judge exactly what other wikis'd want
2015-05-01 20:40:09	@Espyo	so I can't go crazy on the helpers without burning myself away
2015-05-01 20:40:25	@J	at least separate the Pikipedia-specific and general stuff
2015-05-01 20:40:26	@Espyo	and I think I can make it more extendable
2015-05-01 20:40:32	@Espyo	it's mostly separated by comments
2015-05-01 20:40:44	@J	and separate the checkers out from that huge function like I said before
2015-05-01 20:40:50	@Espyo	mhm
2015-05-01 20:41:08	@J	define a checker format like { name: '...', link: '...', check: function () { ... } }
2015-05-01 20:41:14	@J	wait
2015-05-01 20:41:16	@Espyo	mhm
2015-05-01 20:41:23	@Espyo	no, that works
2015-05-01 20:41:25	@J	I guess you want group, then separate group definitions
2015-05-01 20:41:33	@J	hmm
2015-05-01 20:41:35	@J	no, it does
2015-05-01 20:41:36	@Espyo	not really
2015-05-01 20:41:43	@Espyo	name, link, type, check
2015-05-01 20:41:43	@J	groups are separate (your question/warning/whatever)
2015-05-01 20:41:51	@J	yeah, that, 'type'
2015-05-01 20:41:54	@J	is what I meant
2015-05-01 20:41:58	@Espyo	they're just a field
2015-05-01 20:42:00	@J	anyway, yeah, your regex is wrong
2015-05-01 20:42:05	@Espyo	the analyzer can easily work without them
2015-05-01 20:42:09	@Espyo	hmm? what's wrong, then?
2015-05-01 20:42:11	@J	the [^\|] need to be [^|\]]
2015-05-01 20:43:04	@Espyo	you sure I don't have to escape the | ?
2015-05-01 20:43:15	@J	eh, that part's not important, but I don't think so, no
2015-05-01 20:43:24	@J	I don't think you have to escape anything inside [] except ]
2015-05-01 20:43:32	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-01 20:43:35	@J	*inside [^]
2015-05-01 20:43:41	@J	uh
2015-05-01 20:43:42	@J	or something
2015-05-01 20:43:48	@Espyo	well, there's always .
2015-05-01 20:43:53	@Espyo	wait
2015-05-01 20:43:58	@Espyo	would [.] even be a wise thing to do?
2015-05-01 20:44:03	@J	also I don't get the .*_.* part
2015-05-01 20:44:24	@J	I'm going to write a solution separately and then you can compare
2015-05-01 20:44:29	@Espyo	okay
2015-05-01 20:44:32	@J	it's supposed to find links that display _?
2015-05-01 20:44:49	@J	oh, I see what you're doing
2015-05-01 20:45:44	@Espyo	links containing _, on the actual page name part
2015-05-01 20:45:50	@Espyo	spaces ARE more human-readable, after all
2015-05-01 20:46:10	@Espyo	before you complain how this is nitpicking, remember that it's on the "style" category
2015-05-01 20:46:15	@Espyo	you don't use that category unless you are nitpicking
2015-05-01 20:46:25	@J	\[\[([^|]+\|)?[^|\]]*[^|\]]*(\|[^\]]*)?\]\]
2015-05-01 20:46:40	@J	it's beautiful
2015-05-01 20:46:48	@Espyo	...
2015-05-01 20:46:55	@Espyo	I didn't finish reading it
2015-05-01 20:46:57	@Espyo	but where's the underscore
2015-05-01 20:47:01	@J	uh...
2015-05-01 20:47:09	@J	I'm going to say I typo'd
2015-05-01 20:47:18	@J	that's the only character missing
2015-05-01 20:47:22	@Espyo	the single most important one
2015-05-01 20:47:24	@J	\[\[([^|]+\|)?[^|\]]*_[^|\]]*(\|[^\]]*)?\]\]
2015-05-01 20:48:46	@J	hmm, probably want \] in the first [^ too
2015-05-01 20:48:52	@Espyo	[[a|asd_zxc|z]]
2015-05-01 20:48:53	Testyo	"a|asd_zxc|z" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=a|asd_zxc|z
2015-05-01 20:48:56	@Espyo	I think it would match that ^
2015-05-01 20:49:24	@J	yes, it would
2015-05-01 20:49:32	@J	what does that do?
2015-05-01 20:49:42	@Espyo	it probably makes MediaWiki cry
2015-05-01 20:49:47	@J	I thought arguments to [[ after the 2nd are extras
2015-05-01 20:49:50	@J	like title=...
2015-05-01 20:49:58	@Espyo	hm, I never thought of that
2015-05-01 20:49:59	@Espyo	you might be right
2015-05-01 20:50:06	@J	I'll clarify it anyway
2015-05-01 20:50:10	@J	\[\[(link\|)?before_after(extras)?\]\]
2015-05-01 20:50:10	@J	link = [^|\]]+
2015-05-01 20:50:10	@J	before = after = [^|\]]*
2015-05-01 20:50:10	@J	extras = \|[^\]]*
2015-05-01 20:50:11	@Espyo	but still, it would match [[a|zxczxc_qweqwe]]
2015-05-01 20:50:12	Testyo	"a|zxczxc_qweqwe" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=a|zxczxc_qweqwe
2015-05-01 20:50:23	@J	shouldn't it match that?
2015-05-01 20:50:29	@J	that would display _
2015-05-01 20:51:37	@Espyo	I think we can forget the extras part
2015-05-01 20:51:42	@Espyo	for one thing, nobody really uses that in links
2015-05-01 20:51:50	@Espyo	and second, I think a simple .* could get the job done
2015-05-01 20:51:55	@Espyo	or at least [^|\]]
2015-05-01 20:52:03	@Espyo	I mean [^|\]]*
2015-05-01 20:52:31	@J	yeah, they'd probably just use {{tt}}
2015-05-01 20:52:32	Testyo	"tt" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:tt
2015-05-01 20:52:36	@Espyo	mhm
2015-05-01 20:52:39	@J	no, no . allowed
2015-05-01 20:52:50	@J	everything inside must disallow ]
2015-05-01 20:53:01	@J	that's the whole problem
2015-05-01 20:53:06	@J	oh
2015-05-01 20:53:11	@J	...I didn't read what you said after
2015-05-01 20:53:14	@Espyo	right
2015-05-01 20:53:24	@Espyo	I sent the "." part without thinking of it
2015-05-01 20:53:39	@J	but on other wikis extra arguments might be common
2015-05-01 20:53:40	@Espyo	I think we can simplify it if we split it between "single field" and "double field"
2015-05-01 20:53:43	@J	there's no harm having it
2015-05-01 20:53:51	@Espyo	single field being [[abc]], and double being [[abc|def]]
2015-05-01 20:53:51	Testyo	"abc" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=abc
2015-05-01 20:55:18	@J	I prefer just making the optional parts optional because it reduces duplication, but I don't really mind
2015-05-01 20:55:21	@Espyo	\[\[[^|\]*_[^|\]*(\|\]\]) I think this is enough
2015-05-01 20:55:38	@Espyo	meaning, anything that isn't | or ]
2015-05-01 20:55:40	@Espyo	then an underscore
2015-05-01 20:55:45	@Espyo	then anything that isn't | or ]
2015-05-01 20:55:54	@Espyo	and then either a | for another field, or a ]] to close
2015-05-01 20:56:17	@J	you forgot the | in the ()
2015-05-01 20:56:22	@J	for 'or'
2015-05-01 20:56:26	@Espyo	oh, oops
2015-05-01 20:56:29	@Espyo	mhm, I did
2015-05-01 20:56:33	@Espyo	but I think that one's the best one
2015-05-01 20:56:49	@J	that will match [[a_b|hi]] anyway
2015-05-01 20:56:49	Testyo	"a_b|hi" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=a_b|hi
2015-05-01 20:56:55	@Espyo	it's meant to
2015-05-01 20:57:03	@J	no, it's not
2015-05-01 20:57:11	@Espyo	we're trying to find links with underscores in them
2015-05-01 20:57:13	@J	that links to a_b and shows hi, doesn't it?
2015-05-01 20:57:14	@Espyo	in the actual page name part
2015-05-01 20:57:21	@Espyo	the thing is
2015-05-01 20:57:30	@Espyo	[[a_b|hi]] = [[a b|hi]], as far as the wiki cares
2015-05-01 20:57:30	@J	I thought we were trying to find where the displayed text contains _?
2015-05-01 20:57:30	Testyo	"a_b|hi" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=a_b|hi
2015-05-01 20:57:41	@Espyo	so it should find the first, and tell people that the second is more human-readable, for people reading the source
2015-05-01 20:57:46	@Espyo	oh!
2015-05-01 20:57:48	@J	oh
2015-05-01 20:57:49	@Espyo	no, not the displayed text, no
2015-05-01 20:57:52	@Espyo	the opposite
2015-05-01 20:57:53	@J	well then I had it wrong the whole time
2015-05-01 20:57:54	@Espyo	I see what happened
2015-05-01 20:57:57	@Espyo	heh

2015-05-01 20:58:20	@J	hmm
2015-05-01 20:58:36	@J	that's probably fine then
2015-05-01 20:58:53	@Espyo	nothing a quick test won't answer
2015-05-01 21:00:07	@J	oh, I think you should also give problem types a priority, and allow only viewing high-priority ones
2015-05-01 21:00:21	@J	ie. ones that are definitely problems, not just guesses
2015-05-01 21:01:07	@Espyo	well, guesses are under the "question" category
2015-05-01 21:01:11	@Espyo	it's a bit black-and-white
2015-05-01 21:01:18	@Espyo	but it might not be worth the trouble
2015-05-01 21:30:01	@Espyo	sigh
2015-05-01 21:30:09	@Espyo	I tried doing it the "classy" way
2015-05-01 21:30:23	@Espyo	function Pikan() { this.bla = "bla" }
2015-05-01 21:30:45	@Espyo	Pikan.prototype.getBla = function() { return this.bla; }
2015-05-01 21:30:53	@Espyo	pikan = new Pikan();
2015-05-01 21:31:02	@Espyo	alert(pikan.getBla());
2015-05-01 21:31:05	@Espyo	but it just doesn't work
2015-05-01 21:39:31	@Espyo	nuts to this
2015-05-01 21:39:33	@Espyo	this isn't worth it
2015-05-01 21:42:57	@J	it's strange that that wouldn't work
2015-05-01 21:43:14	@J	but 'this'/binding is weird and broken, just use closures
2015-05-01 21:43:49	@Espyo	huh?
2015-05-01 21:43:50	@J	var mkPikan = function () { var pikan = { bla: 'bla' }; pikan.getBla = function () { return pikan.bla }; return pikan }
2015-05-01 21:43:57	@J	var pikan = mkPikan()
2015-05-01 21:44:00	@J	pikan.getBla()
2015-05-01 21:44:20	@Espyo	I see what you mean
2015-05-01 21:44:24	@Espyo	eesh, what a workaround
2015-05-01 21:44:36	@J	it's not a workaround, it's just a coding style
2015-05-01 21:44:42	@J	and a perfectly valid one
2015-05-01 21:44:46	@Espyo	it's kind of both
2015-05-01 21:44:50	@Espyo	only because of Javascript's shenanigans
2015-05-01 21:45:20	@J	at work we use Javascript, and we have a standard function to replace all methods on a constructor's prototype with bound versions
2015-05-01 21:45:44	@J	ie. it essentially does pikan.getBla = pikan.getBla.bind(pikan) for all of them
2015-05-01 21:45:57	@J	now that's a workaround
2015-05-01 21:46:30	@J	it allows use to assume every function is already correctly bound, though, so passing functions as arguments is always easy
2015-05-01 21:46:45	@J	there's no runTasks([a.task.bind(a), b.task.bind(b), ...])
2015-05-01 22:06:42	@Espyo	hmmm...

2015-05-02 21:35:08	@Espyo	J suggested some changes to prettien up the code
2015-05-02 21:35:17	@Espyo	not sure if I'll go through with them, because they're SO hard to implement
2015-05-02 21:35:21	@Espyo	well, I'll go through with some
2015-05-02 21:35:25	@Espyo	if all goes well, it'll be official by next week
2015-05-02 21:35:32	@PikFan	sweet

2015-05-02 21:52:03	@Espyo	well, all pages use Javascript that we can edit
2015-05-02 21:52:06	@Espyo	the script is nothing but Javascript
2015-05-02 21:52:07	@Espyo	so
2015-05-02 21:52:31	@PikFan	it'll be a plugin, then
2015-05-02 21:52:38	@Espyo	not quite
2015-05-02 21:52:48	@Espyo	plugins work on the wiki side

2015-05-03 18:54:17	@J	okay, my YouTube subscriptions script rewrite is finally working
2015-05-03 18:54:34	@J	I was generating an invalid feed for ages, couldn't work out why
2015-05-03 18:54:41	@J	turns out I just forgot the end tag
2015-05-03 18:55:53	@Espyo	ouch
2015-05-03 19:04:38	@Espyo	egh
2015-05-03 19:04:40	@Espyo	compiling takes a bit
2015-05-03 19:04:46	@Espyo	so I usually alt-tab to do something else while I wait
2015-05-03 19:04:49	@Espyo	eventually, it finishes
2015-05-03 19:05:00	@Espyo	and places the stdout window right in front of everything
2015-05-03 19:05:05	@Espyo	(yeah, stdout has to be its own window)
2015-05-03 19:05:23	@Espyo	I have to minimize it, because I know it still has to load more stuff, so I can continue browsing whatever
2015-05-03 19:05:29	@Espyo	 3 seconds later, it opens up the game window
2015-05-03 19:05:33	@Espyo	still not ready, I have to minimize again
2015-05-03 19:05:44	@Espyo	 3 seconds later, it REOPENS the window, for some reason I still can't understand
2015-05-03 19:06:03	@Espyo	probably because at that point, the window's title changes from "Allegro" to "Pikmin fangame engine"
2015-05-03 19:06:07	@Espyo	I minimize it AGAIN
2015-05-03 19:06:14	@Espyo	and only 3 seconds after that is it ready
2015-05-03 19:06:28	@Espyo	I bet this wouldn't happen with two screens
2015-05-03 19:06:37	@Espyo	damn tiny room and lack of second monitor

2015-05-03 19:10:08	@J	why does it take so long to launch after compiling?
2015-05-03 19:10:21	@J	debugging or something?
2015-05-03 19:10:47	@Espyo	no, I wait during the compiling part
2015-05-03 19:10:56	@Espyo	from compiling to running, it's pretty instant
2015-05-03 19:11:04	@Espyo	the windows themselves DO take some time to load
2015-05-03 19:11:31	@Espyo	I think Testyo hit the nail on the head
2015-05-03 19:11:32	Testyo	I'm trying to find it among the really don't
2015-05-03 19:11:33	@Espyo	Testyo: lm 2
2015-05-03 19:11:33	Testyo	I said hey seems OS-dependent because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages hey and but it seems OS-dependent.
2015-05-03 19:12:34	@J	you just mentioned 6 seconds after it opens
2015-05-03 19:12:41	@J	I didn't even see Testyo say that
2015-05-03 19:12:42	Testyo	not sure this article is really necessary, but at the very
2015-05-03 19:12:47	@Espyo	he said it on #Testyo
2015-05-03 19:12:47	Testyo	you know there are no pre-requisites to call them that
2015-05-03 19:12:51	@J	oh
2015-05-03 19:12:59	@Espyo	it compiles, I wait doing something else
2015-05-03 19:13:08	@Espyo	when it's done compiling, it starts debugging right away, in the background
2015-05-03 19:13:14	@Espyo	at this point I'm still on Firefox or whatever
2015-05-03 19:13:27	@Espyo	then it takes 3 seconds to load the first window, more or less
2015-05-03 19:13:36	@J	I count 6 seconds from opening the game window to being ready to use
2015-05-03 19:13:38	@Espyo	and that's the first time of the three that it annoys me with a popup window
2015-05-03 19:14:01	@Espyo	*shrug* the time's not really the thing here
2015-05-03 19:14:08	@Espyo	it's the fact that it pops up the windows for the game in front of me
2015-05-03 19:14:10	@Espyo	three times, no less
2015-05-03 19:14:21	@Espyo	I mean, it makes sense it would
2015-05-03 19:14:23	@J	yeah, I get that
2015-05-03 19:14:29	@Espyo	but at the very least, it shouldn't pop the same window twice
2015-05-03 19:14:31	@J	I was just saying a thing
2015-05-03 19:14:32	@Espyo	that's just weird
2015-05-03 19:14:34	@Espyo	right
2015-05-03 19:14:44	@Espyo	 6 seconds... I could swear the last time you tried, it took 2
2015-05-03 19:16:45	@J	_you_ said 6
2015-05-03 19:16:48	@J	3 + 3
2015-05-03 19:16:55	@J	why are you making it seem like I'm crazy
2015-05-03 19:16:57	@J	you're the crazy one
2015-05-03 19:17:06	@Espyo	you make me crazy
2015-05-03 19:18:26	@Espyo	if you ever make a GUI in a game for a repetitive task
2015-05-03 19:18:31	@Espyo	please don't forget shortcut keys
2015-05-03 19:18:45	@Espyo	I think I would've driven myself off a cliff if I didn't implement shortcut keys for the animation editor
2015-05-03 19:19:00	@Espyo	I had to change the way hitboxes work and now I'm rewriting all of the Bulborb's hitboxes
2015-05-03 19:19:14	@Espyo	and without the ability to go back and forth between fields and hitboxes, I think I'd have died already

2015-05-05 19:36:56	UltraMario	well i think that was dead for a while

2015-05-05 19:37:03	Yoshi2_	hey Espyo & Testyo

2015-05-05 19:37:19	@Espyo	yeah, looks like it's just been gone for a month or so
2015-05-05 19:37:22	UltraMario	and not a crappy wikia or something
2015-05-05 19:37:23	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-05-05 19:37:30	@Espyo	I honestly wouldn't care if it were on wikia
2015-05-05 19:37:31	UltraMario	wikibound is pretty dead too

2015-05-05 19:38:03	@Espyo	the pages rarely load
2015-05-05 19:38:10	@Espyo	plus it's pretty inactive to begin with, and all
2015-05-05 19:38:36	@Espyo	sucks that not all of the wikis survived...
2015-05-05 19:39:22	UltraMario	but espyo
2015-05-05 19:39:24	UltraMario	i mean
2015-05-05 19:39:27	UltraMario	even tho it's inactive
2015-05-05 19:39:34	UltraMario	it still has alright articles
2015-05-05 19:39:45	@Espyo	yeah, of course
2015-05-05 19:39:47	UltraMario	also it loads fine for me
2015-05-05 19:39:48	UltraMario	:|
2015-05-05 19:40:21	UltraMario	the only niwa-related wiki i don't like is wikirby
2015-05-05 19:40:27	UltraMario	it has stubs and red links
2015-05-05 19:40:28	UltraMario	everywhere
2015-05-05 19:40:58	@Espyo	sucks
2015-05-05 19:40:59	UltraMario	which is why i like kirby wikia better
2015-05-05 19:41:04	UltraMario	i know it's still wikia
2015-05-05 19:41:05	UltraMario	but
2015-05-05 19:41:06	UltraMario	it
2015-05-05 19:41:11	UltraMario	's at least actually good
2015-05-05 19:41:17	UltraMario	and has quality to it
2015-05-05 19:41:18	@Espyo	I don't go on Wikibound often, but last few times I went, months ago, it barely loaded
2015-05-05 19:41:21	@Espyo	maybe it's better now
2015-05-05 19:41:23	UltraMario	oh
2015-05-05 19:41:25	UltraMario	well
2015-05-05 19:41:28	@Espyo	yeah, it sucks, but sometimes, the wikia is just better
2015-05-05 19:41:28	UltraMario	maybe it was down
2015-05-05 19:41:29	UltraMario	or something
2015-05-05 19:41:35	UltraMario	oh
2015-05-05 19:41:49	UltraMario	so you mean like some wikias are better than their wiki counterparts?
2015-05-05 19:41:51	UltraMario	yeah
2015-05-05 19:41:52	UltraMario	it is
2015-05-05 19:41:55	UltraMario	i mean like
2015-05-05 19:42:15	UltraMario	not only does kirby wikia cover like all the stuff important to the characters in articles
2015-05-05 19:42:15	UltraMario	but
2015-05-05 19:42:33	UltraMario	they even go as far as getting all the artwork of the character and sprites in almost every game of them
2015-05-05 19:42:42	UltraMario	i admire their effort
2015-05-05 19:42:46	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-05-05 19:42:57	@Espyo	maybe Wikirby should've forked
2015-05-05 19:43:01	@Espyo	instead of creating a new wiki from scratch
2015-05-05 19:43:10	@Espyo	I mean, I think they created one from scratch
2015-05-05 19:43:15	UltraMario	yeah
2015-05-05 19:43:18	UltraMario	i mean
2015-05-05 19:43:30	UltraMario	they should've merged or something
2015-05-05 19:43:45	UltraMario	i'm not even sure if that's wiki's active based on my previous experiences with it
2015-05-05 19:45:50	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-05 19:49:42	@J	yeah, Nintendo Wiki is doing interesting things, but the others look fine
2015-05-05 19:50:15	@J	I guess either someone did an update and failed, or some software on the server (maybe PHP) was updated
2015-05-05 19:51:12	@J	looks like a known issue, needs a MW update
2015-05-05 19:53:35	@J	ah http://www.niwanetwork.org/forums/index.php?topic=1434.0;topicseen
2015-05-05 19:53:43	@J	fairly recent, then
2015-05-05 19:55:37	@Espyo	oh, all right
2015-05-05 19:55:39	@Espyo	no reason to panic then
2015-05-05 19:58:04	UltraMario	will it be back up then?
2015-05-05 19:58:12	@J	at some point
2015-05-05 19:58:16	UltraMario	cool
2015-05-05 19:58:31	UltraMario	does it have articles for anything besides video games
2015-05-05 19:58:34	@J	if no-one replies in a few days I'll try to apply the patch I mentioned, it's not like I can make it any worse
2015-05-05 19:58:39	UltraMario	and articles for stuff that aren't on other niwa wikis?

2015-05-05 19:58:56	UltraMario	articles that aren't articles for video game titles
2015-05-05 19:59:00	@J	it's supposed to, but I don't know how complete it is
2015-05-05 19:59:03	UltraMario	but for stuff like characters and items
2015-05-05 19:59:07	UltraMario	me neither
2015-05-05 19:59:23	UltraMario	but last time i saw it it was like dead
2015-05-05 19:59:28	@J	it's supposed to have stuff about Nintendo the company, employees, etc., and articles about the NIWA wikis
2015-05-05 19:59:52	UltraMario	what about nintendo games other wikis don't cover
2015-05-05 19:59:58	UltraMario	like duck hunt
2015-05-05 20:06:30	@J	mm, not sure
2015-05-05 20:06:33	@J	it's possible
2015-05-05 20:06:47	@J	there was a topic on the forum at one point about coverage and scope

2015-05-05 21:36:35	@J	my rocket is rolling down that
2015-05-05 21:36:44	@J	and not enjoying it
2015-05-05 21:37:24	@Espyo	he's not enjoying it because he's on a solo mission
2015-05-05 21:37:55	@Espyo	you know that with every companion the chances of happiness within the ship increase by 2^n
2015-05-05 21:38:43	@J	don't be silly, he doesn't need friends
2015-05-05 21:39:01	@J	just sudden skydives from orbit
2015-05-05 21:39:24	@J	also, I said the rocket's not enjoying it
2015-05-05 21:39:28	@J	I don't care about the guy
2015-05-05 21:39:39	@Espyo	thought so
2015-05-05 21:39:49	@Espyo	still, you need more guys
2015-05-05 21:39:55	@Espyo	because there'll always be that sadistic mongrel that likes it
2015-05-05 21:40:14	@Espyo	how the hell did you manage to smack against something that big anyway?
2015-05-05 21:40:17	@Espyo	didn't you see it?
2015-05-05 21:40:29	@J	not from space
2015-05-05 21:40:41	@J	in my defence, it didn't look so steep
2015-05-05 21:40:51	@Espyo	you must've come in really hot to not have time to avoid it anyway
2015-05-05 21:41:04	@J	I was thinking 'oh dear, it'll probably topple over'
2015-05-05 21:41:15	@Espyo	boy did it ever
2015-05-05 21:41:23	@J	not 'oh no, it's going to roll down that MOUNTAIN for 10 minutes, destroying everything but the cockpit'
2015-05-05 21:41:56	@Espyo	at least the cockpit's okay
2015-05-05 21:42:00	@Espyo	so the ship IS still going
2015-05-05 21:42:17	@J	and now it stopped, I let the guy get out, and didn't realise it was upside down and he suffocated in the sand or something
2015-05-05 21:50:21	@Espyo	probably makes sense
2015-05-05 21:55:15	@J	look, I just can't aim, okay
2015-05-05 21:55:26	@J	I was trying to hit the desert; tried again now and hit the ocean
2015-05-05 21:56:07	@Espyo	can't you just get the guy to skydive?
2015-05-05 21:56:21	@J	but I want sand science or something
2015-05-05 21:56:32	@Espyo	skydive to land on the sand
2015-05-05 21:56:39	@Espyo	you already choked him, it's the least you can do

2015-05-05 23:22:01	@J	when you're about to land is probably the worst time to realise you forgot to add landing thingies
2015-05-05 23:22:04	@J	legs, whatever
2015-05-05 23:23:15	@Espyo	you can land without them
2015-05-05 23:23:18	@Espyo	just not smoothly
2015-05-05 23:24:19	@J	okay, I somehow did it
2015-05-05 23:24:35	@J	I'm fairly sure you're not meant to use the engine exploding as a way of slowing you down
2015-05-05 23:25:47	@Espyo	hey, if it works...
2015-05-05 23:27:27	@J	next time I need more batteries to send back all the science
2015-05-05 23:27:36	@J	because no way is the guy getting back into space without an engine
2015-05-05 23:27:39	@J	or fuel tank
2015-05-05 23:27:42	@J	or any electricity
2015-05-05 23:27:58	@Espyo	oh well
2015-05-05 23:28:37	@J	do you know if the amount of electricity to send data depends on how far away you are?
2015-05-05 23:28:58	@Espyo	it shouldn't if you aim it right
2015-05-05 23:29:05	@Espyo	you let the data travel through the vacuum
2015-05-05 23:29:08	@Espyo	no energy required
2015-05-05 23:29:15	@Espyo	unless you were asking for real
2015-05-05 23:29:21	@Espyo	I wouldn't know, never played KSP
2015-05-05 23:29:38	@J	well, IRL it does matter because of radiation and stuff
2015-05-05 23:29:54	@J	plus it's really hard to focus a beam so well
2015-05-05 23:30:01	@Espyo	it is
2015-05-05 23:30:04	@J	the angles involved at large distances are _really_ tiny
2015-05-05 23:30:08	@Espyo	mhm
2015-05-05 23:30:11	@J	just wondering if the game simulated that
2015-05-05 23:30:18	@Espyo	I'd love it if it did
2015-05-05 23:31:17	@J	it _does_ do heat occlusion
2015-05-05 23:31:31	@J	as in, stuff can block sources of heat from things behind it
2015-05-05 23:32:33	@Espyo	nice
2015-05-05 23:33:32	@J	same for drag/lift, I believe
2015-05-05 23:33:38	@J	anyway, I should sleep, goodnight
2015-05-05 23:34:00	@Espyo	night

2015-05-09 12:16:31	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-05-09 12:16:32	Testyo	April Fool's doesn't justify it would help if your 'advanced language' example was actually English
2015-05-09 12:18:41	@Espyo	hi
2015-05-09 12:19:53	Yoshi2	Espyo: are you planning to try out splatoon today?
2015-05-09 12:20:00	@Espyo	mhm
2015-05-09 12:20:05	@Espyo	since the direct, I've lost my hype
2015-05-09 12:20:12	@Espyo	not pleased to know that half of the game is not available from the start
2015-05-09 12:20:23	@Espyo	but I still want to try the demo
2015-05-09 12:21:12	Yoshi2	I'm kind of hyped for splatoon
2015-05-09 12:21:18	Yoshi2	the demo is quite a bit of fun
2015-05-09 12:21:38	Yoshi2	too bad the test run only goes for one hour at a time
2015-05-09 12:22:32	Yoshi2	Espyo: so if you have the demo downloaded, you should probably hurry up
2015-05-09 12:22:33	@Espyo	so you played the previous one?
2015-05-09 12:22:38	@Espyo	huh?
2015-05-09 12:22:40	@Espyo	is it going on now?
2015-05-09 12:22:43	Yoshi2	yup
2015-05-09 12:22:54	@Espyo	OH!
2015-05-09 12:22:55	Yoshi2	there was one in the morning, and another is going on right now
2015-05-09 12:22:56	@Espyo	okay, thanks
2015-05-09 12:33:38	@J	is this that paint-based shooter game?
2015-05-09 12:34:24	Yoshi2	J: yup
2015-05-09 12:34:37	@J	what's going on?
2015-05-09 12:35:16	@J	there's an online-multiplayer-only demo and their servers are only up at certain times?
2015-05-09 12:35:45	Yoshi2	yup
2015-05-09 12:36:14	@J	hmm
2015-05-09 12:36:14	Yoshi2	it's basically a multiplayer test
2015-05-09 12:36:56	@J	I seem to recall it being quite similar to de Blob?
2015-05-09 12:37:42	Yoshi2	no idea, I've never played de blob
2015-05-09 12:38:59	@J	me neither
2015-05-09 12:48:47	@Espyo	quite fun
2015-05-09 13:02:01	@Espyo	just got 8 kills and 2 deaths this last round
2015-05-09 13:02:09	@Espyo	the game encourages spawn camping
2015-05-09 13:02:18	@Espyo	sure, you don't know when people will spawn
2015-05-09 13:02:21	@Espyo	but a marker appears when they do
2015-05-09 13:02:24	@Espyo	just wait for them, and boom
2015-05-09 13:04:23	Yoshi2	yep
2015-05-09 13:27:20	Yoshi2	hmm, at some point I should go back to looking for unused content in battalion wars
2015-05-09 13:27:59	@Espyo	I don't know what is it about searching for unused content
2015-05-09 13:28:01	@Espyo	that is so fun
2015-05-09 13:28:04	@Espyo	but so willing to be forgotten
2015-05-09 13:29:19	Yoshi2	the biggest issue is that I have no idea about any of the file types used in the game
2015-05-09 13:29:38	Yoshi2	I barely managed to parse the archive file containing lots of data into smaller files, but in a hacky way
2015-05-09 13:30:06	@Espyo	right

2015-05-09 14:21:04	Yoshi2	when I tried to remove a screw from my defective 3DS, I ruined the screw
2015-05-09 14:21:25	Yoshi2	couldn't turn it at all, had to break the plastic around it
2015-05-09 14:21:36	@Espyo	ouch
2015-05-09 14:22:04	@J	aren't DS screws non-standard?
2015-05-09 14:22:08	@J	that's probably why
2015-05-09 14:22:12	@J	same as most Nintendo consoles
2015-05-09 14:22:39	Yoshi2	on the 3DS they were standard
2015-05-09 14:22:42	Yoshi2	but very small

2015-05-09 19:20:40	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2015-05-09 19:20:54	@Espyo	obviously, it can't work right the first time
2015-05-09 19:21:36	@J	[19:18:44] @Espyo ...why does ceil() return a floating point
2015-05-09 19:21:44	@J	that's true in lots of languages and I always found it strange
2015-05-09 19:22:08	@J	maybe an optimisation thing

2015-05-09 19:22:55	@J	since I guess it keeps a fair number of the bits the same in almost all cases
2015-05-09 19:23:13	@Espyo	hmm
2015-05-09 19:23:25	@Espyo	fair enough

2015-05-09 19:29:36	Yoshi2_	Espyo: I think in roughly half an hour there will be the next splatoon testrun
2015-05-09 19:29:45	@Espyo	yep
2015-05-09 19:31:45	Miles_	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0_0jOkRQVk
2015-05-09 19:32:55	@Espyo	good GRIEF
2015-05-09 19:33:01	@Espyo	that is amazing
2015-05-09 19:33:50	Yoshi2_	I have no idea what is happening there, but metroid is pretty damn cool
2015-05-09 19:35:20	Miles_	There's a glitch called Morph Ball Invulnerability where you permanently keep the cannon ball effect from orb cannons
2015-05-09 19:35:39	Miles_	It makes you invincible (hence the name) and you instantly kill specific enemies when you roll near them
2015-05-09 19:35:46	Miles_	Chykka Adult is one of those specific enemies
2015-05-09 19:36:05	@Espyo	but why, Nintendo?
2015-05-09 19:36:23	Miles_	Because
2015-05-09 19:36:40	Miles_	You're not supposed to be able to damage Chykka's "main" HP source
2015-05-09 19:37:06	Miles_	For some reason Screw Attack and Cannon Ball can
2015-05-09 19:37:31	Miles_	But you need to take out all of Chykka's HP at once in order to kill it
2015-05-09 19:37:42	Miles_	Chykka has 500 HP
2015-05-09 19:37:50	Miles_	Screw Attack does 36 per frame
2015-05-09 19:37:58	Miles_	Cannon Ball does 500000 per frame
2015-05-09 19:38:02	Miles_	Soooooo
2015-05-09 19:38:04	Yoshi2_	oh wow
2015-05-09 19:40:43	@Espyo	awesome
2015-05-09 19:42:56	@J	you don't have to do anything special to keep it through cutscenes and stuff?
2015-05-09 19:44:37	Miles_	You can't enter an orb cannon again and it isn't kept when saving and reloading
2015-05-09 19:44:41	Miles_	Aside from that, no
2015-05-09 19:45:46	Miles_	It's a really old glitch... I found a much easier/faster way to get it earlier this week though
2015-05-09 19:46:05	Miles_	It ideally would take about a minute to set up in an Any% run
2015-05-09 19:46:18	Miles_	Which is less than how long the Chykka Adult fight lasts

2015-05-12 19:58:36	@Espyo	I should
2015-05-12 19:58:44	@Espyo	how does one devote enough "espy"?
2015-05-12 19:59:14	Yoshi2	next time, do think about a nintendo employee coming to me and telling me everything I need to know to read the bms format
2015-05-12 20:01:03	@Espyo	and hiring you after learning of your dedication
2015-05-12 20:01:08	Yoshi2	yes
2015-05-12 20:01:11	UltraMario	espy
2015-05-12 20:01:11	UltraMario	espyo
2015-05-12 20:01:11	@Espyo	you see, it only works if it's plausible
2015-05-12 20:01:15	@Espyo	sup UltraMari
2015-05-12 20:01:25	Yoshi2	too bad
2015-05-12 20:02:12	@Espyo	no, that's plausible
2015-05-12 20:02:15	@Espyo	unlikely, but plausible
2015-05-12 20:02:20	@Espyo	but now, stuff like me being the president
2015-05-12 20:02:21	@Espyo	that isn't
2015-05-12 20:03:02	Yoshi2	I'll check my email, maybe somebody offered to help me out
2015-05-12 20:03:39	Yoshi2	a couple of emails about stuff happening on github, and one email telling me that I received a gift on steam
2015-05-12 20:03:44	@Espyo	nice
2015-05-12 20:03:49	Yoshi2	nope, nobody wants to help me out :V
2015-05-12 20:15:30	Yoshi2	well, with the way my code looks, I'd be suprised if anybody could help me out
2015-05-12 20:15:36	Yoshi2	need to work on PEP8ifying my code
2015-05-12 20:19:11	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-05-12 20:20:49	Yoshi2	but I can't work on the code until I'm done with my homework
2015-05-12 20:20:57	Yoshi2	and I'm never done with my homework
2015-05-12 20:21:40	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-05-12 20:23:21	Yoshi2	and it doesn't help that I am playing silly little games instead of doing homework
2015-05-12 20:24:46	@Espyo	hm

2015-05-12 23:06:19	@J	try the forums, or the Skype chat
2015-05-12 23:06:34	@Espyo	the forums get one response every decade
2015-05-12 23:06:40	@Espyo	I'd have better luck on the Skype chat
2015-05-12 23:07:26	@J	no idea how active it is, though; I hardly use Skype
2015-05-12 23:07:56	@J	if it is active, it's probably timezone-specific to America
2015-05-12 23:08:40	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-12 23:09:55	@J	uh...how do you view chats in Skype?
2015-05-12 23:10:00	@J	oh, found it
2015-05-12 23:10:09	@J	...the clock icon for some reason
2015-05-12 23:10:59	@J	okay, you're not in either one, want me to invite you then?
2015-05-12 23:11:05	@J	there's a staff chat and a public chat
2015-05-12 23:11:16	@J	staff as in any wiki staff, not a NIWA-specific thing
2015-05-12 23:11:48	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-12 23:12:11	@Espyo	what about the public one?
2015-05-12 23:12:15	@Espyo	is that more NIWA-specific?
2015-05-12 23:12:35	@J	uh
2015-05-12 23:13:00	@J	I mean, the chats are both NIWA specific, but the definition of 'staff' isn't NIWA specific, you just have to be an admin on any wiki
2015-05-12 23:13:43	@J	who's starting a Splatoon wiki anyway?
2015-05-12 23:14:17	@Espyo	the wikia folk
2015-05-12 23:14:22	@Espyo	the game launches on the 29th
2015-05-12 23:14:26	@Espyo	so they're still in time to move
2015-05-12 23:14:35	@J	from Pikmin Wiki, you mean?
2015-05-12 23:14:41	@Espyo	oh, sorry
2015-05-12 23:14:46	@Espyo	the Splatoon wikia folk
2015-05-12 23:14:49	@J	oh
2015-05-12 23:15:06	@J	and someone already convinced them to go independent?
2015-05-12 23:15:09	@J	quick work
2015-05-12 23:15:12	@Espyo	we did
2015-05-12 23:15:24	@Espyo	we = me and another Pikipedia/Pikmin wikia admin
2015-05-12 23:15:32	@Espyo	we're still discussing
2015-05-12 23:15:40	@Espyo	plus we've asked the community on reddit for opinions
2015-05-12 23:15:45	@Espyo	but it looks like things are going well
2015-05-12 23:15:56	@Espyo	with luck, we'll have another franchise join NIWA, and be a good wiki
2015-05-12 23:16:00	@Espyo	and the wikia one will be forgotten
2015-05-12 23:16:07	@Espyo	of course we know we never have that kind of luck
2015-05-12 23:16:07	@J	hopefully
2015-05-12 23:16:17	@Espyo	we had to pry our things off of wikia twice
2015-05-12 23:16:20	@Espyo	but hey, WE did it
2015-05-12 23:16:24	@Espyo	and we had eight years of wikia
2015-05-12 23:16:28	@Espyo	these guys can do it, no problem
2015-05-12 23:16:42	@Espyo	plus with existing knowledge and tools
2015-05-12 23:16:50	@Espyo	like your bot, which I still have lying around for some reason
2015-05-12 23:17:17	@J	pfft, that guy
2015-05-12 23:17:37	@J	anyway, I need to go fairly soon, want me to invite you to the staff chat?
2015-05-12 23:19:20	@J	for reference: you already know Porple hosts a few wikis, but he doesn't really get involved in NIWA
2015-05-12 23:19:34	@J	tacopill hosts a few of the smaller wikis, I believe
2015-05-12 23:20:12	@J	Archaic is involved with Pokemon Wiki, and I think has offered hosting a few times in the past
2015-05-12 23:23:07	@Espyo	all right
2015-05-12 23:23:11	@Espyo	and yeah, the staff chat, please
2015-05-12 23:24:00	@J	oh, it says I can't
2015-05-12 23:24:10	@J	maybe you have to be some sort of chat admin or something...?
2015-05-12 23:25:54	@J	I'm not going to go asking because I'm leaving like right now
2015-05-12 23:26:17	@Espyo	hm, all right
2015-05-12 23:26:19	@Espyo	thanks anyway
2015-05-12 23:26:20	@J	I can try inviting you to the public chat, or you could try the forum, maybe even PM someone there, or we can leave it until tomorrow
2015-05-12 23:26:35	@Espyo	try inviting me to the public one real quick, then
2015-05-12 23:26:57	@J	nope, didn't work
2015-05-12 23:27:01	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-12 23:27:03	@Espyo	well, tomorrow then
2015-05-12 23:27:04	@Espyo	good night
2015-05-12 23:27:07	@J	bye
2015-05-12 23:27:22	@Espyo	Testyo: memo J NIWA stuff and all that
2015-05-12 23:27:23	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for J saying: NIWA stuff and all that.

2015-05-13 21:52:38	@Espyo	hey
2015-05-13 21:52:43	@Espyo	the poll's doing quite all right
2015-05-13 21:52:49	@Espyo	NIWA's on the lead by like 70%
2015-05-13 21:53:09	@J	oh, is this the same thing?
2015-05-13 21:53:14	@Espyo	yep, same thing
2015-05-13 21:53:26	Yoshi2_	what kind of poll is that?
2015-05-13 21:53:26	@Espyo	also, can't you ask in either group about adding me?
2015-05-13 21:53:31	@Espyo	doesn't seem like they allow free adding
2015-05-13 21:53:43	@Espyo	we asked the Splatoon subreddit if they wanted to see the wiki on NIWA or wikia
2015-05-13 21:53:47	@Espyo	and NIWA's taking the lead
2015-05-13 21:53:52	@Espyo	we also explained pros, cons, etc.
2015-05-13 21:54:53	@J	I can try, no guarantees I'll get a reply
2015-05-13 21:55:12	@Espyo	okay then
2015-05-13 21:55:16	Yoshi2_	ah
2015-05-13 21:55:19	Yoshi2_	nice
2015-05-13 21:56:52	@J	okay, so if I type a thing and it disappears, what does that mean?
2015-05-13 21:56:55	@J	is my Skype messed up?
2015-05-13 21:58:03	@J	could it mean I'm not in the group any more?
2015-05-13 21:58:07	@J	I have no idea
2015-05-13 21:59:01	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-13 21:59:02	@Espyo	should be lagging
2015-05-13 21:59:07	@J	it's also not loading any log

2015-05-13 22:08:29	@Espyo	yeah

2015-05-13 22:09:17	JPMinClass	let everything be made
2015-05-13 22:09:25	JPMinClass	then organize it all
2015-05-13 22:09:34	JPMinClass	should I lay out a battle plan?
2015-05-13 22:10:18	@Espyo	no need
2015-05-13 22:11:03	@J	honestly, if you have that interest, there's probably someone willing and able to host it, right?
2015-05-13 22:11:17	@J	*that much interest
2015-05-13 22:11:23	@Espyo	of course
2015-05-13 22:11:27	@Espyo	but finding them's the tricky thing
2015-05-13 22:11:46	@J	I mean, within that group, rather than reaching out to NIWA right at the start
2015-05-13 22:12:22	JPMinClass	the biggest issue would be contacting them
2015-05-13 22:12:27	JPMinClass	and asking around
2015-05-13 22:12:33	JPMinClass	we can post a thing on the sub
2015-05-13 22:12:55	JPMinClass	but if in 2 days we get only 44 peeps
2015-05-13 22:13:03	JPMinClass	out of like 4k that regularly view it
2015-05-13 22:13:04	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2015-05-13 22:13:09	@Espyo	I bet most of them are too casual to host
2015-05-13 22:13:15	JPMinClass	thanks testyo...
2015-05-13 22:13:16	Testyo	they probably contain additional data for playing special it automatically cats pages with no icon
2015-05-13 22:13:29	JPMinClass	Y-you too...
2015-05-13 22:13:39	@Espyo	still, the thread is up, and anybody that's interested in hosting can ask if we've got somebody already
2015-05-13 22:13:40	@Espyo	loltestyo
2015-05-13 22:14:01	JPMinClass	true
2015-05-13 22:14:11	JPMinClass	tho they may think we have someone hosting
2015-05-13 22:14:30	JPMinClass	can you add a post to the sub post that asks if anyone would be willing to host?
2015-05-13 22:14:52	@Espyo	sure
2015-05-13 22:16:56	@J	I mean, it depends how active it's likely to be anyway
2015-05-13 22:17:24	@J	have you considered asking Porple?
2015-05-13 22:21:04	JPMinClass	espyo mentioned it
2015-05-13 22:25:24	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-13 22:25:29	@Espyo	but I'm not sure if I want to overload him
2015-05-13 22:25:35	@Espyo	I mean, if the Bulbapedia guy can host
2015-05-13 22:25:41	@Espyo	then Splatoon will be 1% of Bulbapedia's costs
2015-05-13 22:26:03	@Espyo	anyway, I think it'll be fairly active
2015-05-13 22:26:11	@Espyo	at least like any "normal" Nintendo wiki
2015-05-13 22:26:16	@Espyo	like, non Zelda, non Mario
2015-05-13 22:35:11	JPMinClass	wont hurt to ask
2015-05-13 22:35:48	@J	yeah, I think 1% is probably an overestimate there
2015-05-13 22:39:45	JPMinClass	cant we ask both?
2015-05-13 22:39:58	@Espyo	overestimate in that it'd cost even less?
2015-05-13 22:59:03	@J	oh, I didn't read 'cost'
2015-05-13 22:59:14	@Espyo	heh
2015-05-13 22:59:15	@J	I was thinking general usage
2015-05-13 22:59:18	@Espyo	that too
2015-05-13 22:59:27	@Espyo	well, probably not during the initial months
2015-05-13 22:59:29	@J	but of course cost doesn't scale like usage
2015-05-13 23:12:09	@J	okay, I've somehow got into a 'server discussion' Skype group related to NIWA
2015-05-13 23:12:46	@J	Espyo: try contacting 'tacopill' on Skype and he should invite you
2015-05-13 23:13:57	@Espyo	hm, I'll need to find him first
2015-05-13 23:14:03	@Espyo	did you warn him that I was coming?
2015-05-13 23:14:05	@J	yeah
2015-05-13 23:14:10	@Espyo	all right
2015-05-13 23:14:24	@J	and I told him your account name

2015-05-13 23:27:34	@J	he hosts a few smaller wikis
2015-05-13 23:27:42	@J	Lylat Wiki, I think
2015-05-13 23:27:52	@Espyo	probably that

2015-05-14 19:27:59	@Espyo	I haven't added Tacopill
2015-05-14 19:28:01	@Espyo	just went to bed
2015-05-14 19:28:09	@Espyo	so I could do that instead, and he can add me
2015-05-14 19:28:11	@Espyo	your call
2015-05-14 19:28:12	@J	it's fine, I thought I might not be able to add you

2015-05-14 19:29:58	@J	yeah, I don't know how many people are around this sort of time, but you're in
2015-05-14 19:30:10	@J	you should be able to see what I said yesterday
2015-05-14 19:30:54	@J	I swear it's not meant to notify me if I have my status set to DND
2015-05-14 19:32:29	@J	'wow, is that my brain?' 'no, that's your knee'
2015-05-14 19:35:58	@Espyo	thanks
2015-05-14 19:36:20	@Espyo	your quote needs context
2015-05-14 19:36:26	@Espyo	and yeah, skype notifications and backlog is weird
2015-05-14 19:36:30	@Espyo	and adding people
2015-05-14 19:36:31	@Espyo	and logging in
2015-05-14 19:36:34	@Espyo	and everything
2015-05-14 19:36:40	@Espyo	today was the fifth day in a row it asked me to update
2015-05-14 19:36:46	@Espyo	because the other four days, it failed midway through
2015-05-14 19:38:19	@J	my quote does not need context

2015-05-14 19:39:00	Yoshi2	context is for newbies
2015-05-14 19:39:34	@J	well, fortunately my days of applications trying and failing to update themselves are long past
2015-05-14 19:40:52	Yoshi2	I don't even have many applications that I need to update

2015-05-14 19:41:15	Yoshi2	linux is the fortress of sanity
2015-05-14 19:41:21	@J	ah, it notifies you if you have a window already open, but it won't open it in your face with DND
2015-05-14 19:41:28	@J	yeah, except apt is slow in comparison
2015-05-14 19:42:00	Yoshi2	in comparison to what?
2015-05-14 19:42:12	@J	to pacman, the package manager I use
2015-05-14 19:42:34	@J	Yoshi2: yeah, it's crazy how some people basically just use a browser nowadays
2015-05-14 19:42:40	@J	I could never do that, it just seems weird

2015-05-17 12:59:38	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-05-17 12:59:39	Testyo	it only needs to update the versions of the waypoints would take into consideration all locations and obstacles
2015-05-17 12:59:43	@Espyo	hi
2015-05-17 13:01:39	Yoshi2	I wonder, is there any point in casting pointers to a different type in C? (pun sort of intended)
2015-05-17 13:02:10	@Espyo	'course there is
2015-05-17 13:02:21	@Espyo	imagine you have a callback function
2015-05-17 13:02:24	@Espyo	and you want to send it info
2015-05-17 13:02:32	@Espyo	could be an integer, a float, a struct
2015-05-17 13:02:39	@Espyo	you can just cast it to a pointer for (void*)
2015-05-17 13:02:46	@Espyo	and then on the function cast it back to a pointer to whatever
2015-05-17 13:02:59	@Espyo	because the signature of all your callbacks takes a (void*) as an argument
2015-05-17 13:03:13	@Espyo	other than that, it's useful for being a hack
2015-05-17 13:03:25	@Espyo	like converting from ints to floats if you know what you're doing (you're a madman if you do, though)
2015-05-17 13:05:26	Yoshi2	mhmmmm
2015-05-17 13:06:34	Yoshi2	but if you cast the pointer to a void pointer, how do you know how to work with the pointer in the callback function?
2015-05-17 13:08:11	@Espyo	well, if your callback is working with an int, cast it to int
2015-05-17 13:08:18	@Espyo	the callback knows what it needs
2015-05-17 13:10:11	Yoshi2	if the callback knows what it needs, why couldn't it take an int pointer directly?
2015-05-17 13:10:59	@Espyo	because all your callbacks have the same signature
2015-05-17 13:11:07	@Espyo	it's slightly hard to explain, works better with examples
2015-05-17 13:21:22	Yoshi2	I can imagine void pointers being some sort of catch-all for function signatures
2015-05-17 13:21:58	Yoshi2	but if you know how to call the right callback function, why wouldn't the call back function just take that particular type of pointer directly?
2015-05-17 13:22:30	Yoshi2	unless there is something that makes using void pointers much easier than juggling around with other types
2015-05-17 13:22:37	@Espyo	I'll use an example from the engine
2015-05-17 13:22:59	@Espyo	wait
2015-05-17 13:23:02	@Espyo	I don't need to
2015-05-17 13:23:05	@Espyo	threads
2015-05-17 13:23:24	@Espyo	you need to call a function to create a thread
2015-05-17 13:23:30	@Espyo	that function takes another function as a parameter
2015-05-17 13:23:38	@Espyo	that second function is the thread's code
2015-05-17 13:23:42	@Espyo	if you want to send info to your new thread
2015-05-17 13:23:50	@Espyo	you have to send it as a (void*)
2015-05-17 13:24:10	@Espyo	the function to create a thread MUST take a pointer to a function that takes a void*
2015-05-17 13:24:14	@Espyo	there is no other signature available
2015-05-17 13:24:25	@Espyo	still feel like this is easier to understand than it is to explain
2015-05-17 13:26:09	Yoshi2	fair enough
2015-05-17 13:27:52	Yoshi2	so there are use-cases in which using a void pointer is the only way to implement the feature in a sane way
2015-05-17 13:28:53	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-17 13:30:04	@Espyo	like, I use this on my engine, for events for the finite state machines
2015-05-17 13:30:13	@Espyo	but I must not be in the right mindset
2015-05-17 13:30:16	@Espyo	because I cannot remember WHY
2015-05-17 13:50:26	@J	GUI libraries seem to use it for data to pass to signal handlers later, and then they try to implement their own run-time type-checking on top of it
2015-05-17 13:50:44	@J	as far as I'm concerned, it's always crazy and terrible
2015-05-17 13:50:52	@Espyo	but there's no other way
2015-05-17 13:51:14	@J	OTOH, crazy and terrible is kind of what C and C++ exist for, so...
2015-05-17 13:53:11	@Espyo	mhm
2015-05-17 13:53:19	@Espyo	with great power comes great screaming
2015-05-17 13:55:30	Yoshi2	if I have a pointer to some space I allocated, and I want to free the space, what's the difference between doing free(ptr) and free( (void*) ptr)?
2015-05-17 13:56:07	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-05-17 13:56:17	Yoshi2	from what I've heard, there is none, and it's just a matter of programming style
2015-05-17 13:56:28	@Espyo	I've got lunch, and they're in a hurry to eat it
2015-05-17 13:56:32	@Espyo	so I'll check it out after
2015-05-17 13:57:09	Yoshi2	they must be quite evil to eat your lunch
2015-05-17 13:58:33	@J	I thought that was the definition of family - those people who eat your food if you're too slow
2015-05-17 14:17:43	@Espyo	they train you for the real world
2015-05-17 14:17:56	@Espyo	out there, don't think the vultures and hienas won't eat your food
2015-05-17 14:18:12	@Espyo	*hyenas
2015-05-17 14:19:39	@Espyo	but yeah, it's the same thing
2015-05-17 14:19:46	@Espyo	dunno why in the world you'd add more code that does nothing
2015-05-17 14:23:29	Miles	http://i.imgur.com/odc3Rkt.png
2015-05-17 14:23:32	Miles	This looks pretty nice
2015-05-17 14:24:15	@Espyo	mmhmm
2015-05-17 14:38:05	Yoshi2	so I thought I'd try latex once
2015-05-17 14:38:28	Yoshi2	but the installation seems to be 1.2 to 1.8 GB in some cases :/
2015-05-17 14:39:08	@Espyo	you're better off Latexing online
2015-05-17 14:41:11	Yoshi2	mhm, I'm not particulary fond of such online services
2015-05-17 14:43:41	@Espyo	any reason?
2015-05-17 14:44:12	Yoshi2	my currently rather unstable internet connection :I
2015-05-17 14:44:40	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-17 14:48:05	Yoshi2	I do wonder why the package for using latex is more than 1 GB big
2015-05-17 14:51:37	Yoshi2	I actually expected it to be not much more than half a gig
2015-05-17 14:55:04	@Espyo	I expected like 200MB at most
2015-05-17 14:57:23	@J	looks to me like the core distribution is 355MiB installed
2015-05-17 14:58:17	@J	but the whole thing is 1141
2015-05-17 14:59:51	@J	1718 with languages
2015-05-17 15:00:26	Yoshi2	oh joy

2015-05-22 21:57:32	@Espyo	neat
2015-05-22 21:57:36	@Espyo	makes me think why nobody thought of this before
2015-05-22 22:00:44	Yoshi2_	I'm pretty sure the idea of physics based weapon wielding is not particulary new
2015-05-22 22:00:52	@Espyo	probably not
2015-05-22 22:00:57	@Espyo	but as simple and straightforward as that...?
2015-05-22 22:01:30	@J	the focus on rotation is probably the unique part
2015-05-22 22:02:01	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-22 22:02:11	Yoshi2_	I think I once played a 2D game where you were flying around wielding a flail of sorts
2015-05-22 22:02:30	@J	Hammerfight?
2015-05-22 22:03:28	Yoshi2_	yup

2015-05-22 22:04:23	@Espyo	but he eventually found it
2015-05-22 22:04:49	@J	also, completely unrelated again
2015-05-22 22:05:12	@J	I just added a 'case-sensitive' option to the regular expression field source of my file renamer
2015-05-22 22:05:18	@J	but I have no idea why
2015-05-22 22:05:38	@J	because there aren't really any reasonable situations where it would matter
2015-05-22 22:05:53	@J	given that you _always_ want it to match
2015-05-22 22:06:16	@J	so the only place you might want case-sensitive matching is if the same pattern occurred twice in a filename, with different case
2015-05-22 22:06:48	Yoshi2_	I hope nobody needs to use that in a filesystem in which filenames are case insensitive
2015-05-22 22:08:06	@J	Windows is weird
2015-05-22 22:08:12	@Espyo	yep
2015-05-22 22:08:16	@Espyo	dunno if I told this small story yet
2015-05-22 22:08:20	@J	the names are case-insensitive for some operations but not others
2015-05-22 22:08:23	@Espyo	but if you rename a file Abc to abc
2015-05-22 22:08:28	@Espyo	explorer won't update its name
2015-05-22 22:08:31	@Espyo	it'll think it's the same
2015-05-22 22:08:38	@Espyo	only a refresh will bring the right name
2015-05-22 22:08:41	@J	don't you just have to refresh-
2015-05-22 22:08:41	@J	yeah
2015-05-22 22:08:51	@Espyo	you don't have to refresh for "normal" renames, though
2015-05-22 22:08:59	@J	more fun: rename a file to add a space or dot to the end
2015-05-22 22:09:25	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-05-22 22:09:26	@Espyo	I should try
2015-05-22 22:09:42	@Espyo	space made it ignore me
2015-05-22 22:10:46	@J	it's subtly different from ignoring the rename: it just removes trailing spaces and dots
2015-05-22 22:10:53	@J	eg. rename 'a' to 'ab '
2015-05-22 22:13:29	@Espyo	hm, right
2015-05-22 22:13:36	@Espyo	part of me knew that was it
2015-05-22 22:14:43	@J	it's not just in explorer either
2015-05-22 22:15:03	@J	try to create a file, it just creates a different one and says it succeeded

2015-05-22 23:37:19	Waterpikmin	i have a funny story
2015-05-22 23:37:24	@Espyo	hey
2015-05-22 23:37:49	Waterpikmin	so i just saw the gamestop event incident
2015-05-22 23:37:51	Waterpikmin	i saw the article and i remembered something
2015-05-22 23:38:06	Waterpikmin	i was one of those people who got the game early
2015-05-22 23:38:14	Waterpikmin	but i didnt have any problem lol
2015-05-22 23:38:21	Waterpikmin	i was lucky i guess
2015-05-22 23:39:04	Waterpikmin	so one game im excited for is splatoon
2015-05-22 23:39:26	Waterpikmin	a ton of nintendo things have gotten me excited
2015-05-22 23:41:04	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-05-22 23:41:12	@Espyo	most people got the right SKU
2015-05-22 23:41:26	@Espyo	there's going to be another testfire tomorrow for Splatoon
2015-05-22 23:41:27	Waterpikmin	but anyways
2015-05-22 23:41:39	Waterpikmin	yeah im so excited
2015-05-22 23:41:53	Waterpikmin	and the theme park for nintendo at universal
2015-05-22 23:41:57	Waterpikmin	so excited
2015-05-22 23:42:23	@Espyo	the world still needs more info about that
2015-05-22 23:42:34	Waterpikmin	pikmin area anyone? lol
2015-05-22 23:42:46	Waterpikmin	i want to see that so badly
2015-05-22 23:43:10	Waterpikmin	but with pikmin i think they could do something
2015-05-22 23:43:18	@Espyo	yeah, I'd love it
2015-05-22 23:43:21	Waterpikmin	i want to see pikmin 4 at  least announced
2015-05-22 23:43:23	Waterpikmin	at e3
2015-05-22 23:43:40	Waterpikmin	even if there was no gameplay it would be fine
2015-05-22 23:43:53	Waterpikmin	well i guess you could say it has been announced but
2015-05-22 23:44:45	Waterpikmin	at least more info on it
2015-05-22 23:44:58	Waterpikmin	pikmin 3 was kinda small
2015-05-22 23:45:03	@Espyo	it's a bit likely they'll say something
2015-05-22 23:45:09	Waterpikmin	i think it was a start
2015-05-22 23:45:22	Waterpikmin	to the series being revived
2015-05-22 23:45:58	Waterpikmin	but now i think they can now make a better game with what they now know
2015-05-22 23:46:20	@Espyo	yep
2015-05-22 23:46:55	Waterpikmin	with new pikmin types being announced there may be 1
2015-05-22 23:47:08	Waterpikmin	but with new types being announced every game
2015-05-22 23:47:36	Waterpikmin	what i think would make the game so much larger is the cave system from pikmin 2
2015-05-22 23:47:45	Waterpikmin	and maybe not introducing a new type 
2015-05-22 23:47:52	Waterpikmin	but re introducing it 
2015-05-22 23:47:57	Waterpikmin	the bulbmin
2015-05-22 23:48:27	Waterpikmin	i think its possible we can see what it really looks like 
2015-05-22 23:48:57	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-05-22 23:48:58	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-22 23:49:54	Waterpikmin	online mode i know is necessary
2015-05-22 23:50:24	Waterpikmin	because who doesent want to see a pikmin tournament
2015-05-22 23:51:07	@Espyo	I want to play online Pikmin before I die
2015-05-22 23:51:11	@Espyo	please, Nintendo
2015-05-22 23:51:11	Waterpikmin	pikmin has so much potential for nintendo
2015-05-22 23:51:29	Waterpikmin	either that or someone make it themselves as a fan game or something
2015-05-22 23:52:14	Waterpikmin	another thing that is needed is dlc
2015-05-22 23:52:19	@Espyo	maybe
2015-05-22 23:52:20	@Espyo	just maybe
2015-05-22 23:52:25	@Espyo	I'll make my engine work online, one of these days
2015-05-22 23:52:31	Waterpikmin	lol
2015-05-22 23:52:48	@Espyo	DLC worked fine on Pikmin 3
2015-05-22 23:52:52	@Espyo	chances are Pikmin 4 will have it too
2015-05-22 23:53:11	Waterpikmin	dlc is becoming a thing with nintendo games
2015-05-22 23:53:46	Waterpikmin	what do you think your e3 predictions are for the wii u in general?
2015-05-22 23:53:56	Waterpikmin	i want to see animal crossing wii u
2015-05-22 23:54:05	Waterpikmin	the console ones are so much fun
2015-05-22 23:54:21	Waterpikmin	along with the things they can do on console 
2015-05-22 23:54:28	Waterpikmin	hd animal crossing
2015-05-22 23:54:32	@Espyo	hm, let's see
2015-05-22 23:54:38	Waterpikmin	that would be amazing
2015-05-22 23:54:40	@Espyo	Zelda and Metroid is what I'm feeling
2015-05-22 23:54:48	@Espyo	well, besides the obvious stuff like Starfox
2015-05-22 23:54:55	Waterpikmin	that is possible
2015-05-22 23:55:00	Waterpikmin	maybe f zero
2015-05-22 23:55:28	Waterpikmin	i havent been a huge fan of f zero but i know for a fact that it needs a new game
2015-05-22 23:55:45	@Espyo	I want to get into it
2015-05-22 23:55:45	Waterpikmin	i played f zero before and its actually pretty good
2015-05-22 23:55:51	@Espyo	and I think a game on the Wii U would be awesome
2015-05-22 23:56:07	Waterpikmin	more mk8 dlc is possible
2015-05-22 23:58:08	@Espyo	it is
2015-05-22 23:58:16	@Espyo	I'm pretty tired, so I'm heading off now

2015-05-23 12:25:25	@Espyo	hi
2015-05-23 13:48:01	@J	...no, brain, I don't need a spoon to eat sandwiches
2015-05-23 13:48:19	@Espyo	try it
2015-05-23 13:48:25	@Espyo	you could've just discovered the best way to eat them
2015-05-23 13:49:55	Yoshi2	reminds me of the times when I went into the bathroom while carrying dishes
2015-05-23 13:50:33	@Espyo	pfft
2015-05-23 13:52:01	@J	or when I put shampoo in the fridge
2015-05-23 13:52:38	Yoshi2	cold shampoo, yummy

2015-05-23 15:29:31	Yoshi2	" In [[Mission Mode]]'s battle bosses you don't have any of the suits. To prove it, face the [[Plasm Wraith|6th boss]] and run into the combustion plasm."

2015-05-23 15:29:45	Yoshi2	no idea what that was supposed to mean anyway
2015-05-23 15:34:35	@Espyo	hm
2015-05-23 15:34:43	@Espyo	it means you don't have the Forged Courage
2015-05-23 15:34:52	@J	'battle bosses'
2015-05-23 15:35:00	@Espyo	if you did, you could go on the fire plasm that the Plasm Wraith shoots and be unharmed
2015-05-23 15:35:05	@Espyo	it's a mode in Mission Mode
2015-05-23 15:35:17	@Espyo	actually I think it's Defeat Bosses, but whatever
2015-05-23 15:35:28	@J	needs caps then, so it doesn't sound crazy
2015-05-23 15:35:47	@J	otherwise it looks like you just messed up trying to say 'boss battles'
2015-05-23 15:38:44	@Espyo	yep

2015-05-24 18:04:42	@J	what do you think is the clearest name to use when I mean current working directory of the process?
2015-05-24 18:05:17	@J	http://i.imgur.com/ragVKpZ.png
2015-05-24 18:07:30	Yoshi2_	I suggest "current working directory"
2015-05-24 18:07:57	@J	bit long though
2015-05-24 18:08:02	@J	if you look where I'm putting it
2015-05-24 18:08:18	Yoshi2_	well, you said nothing about it having to be short ¯\(ツ)/¯  
2015-05-24 18:08:22	Yoshi2_	where will you put it?
2015-05-24 18:08:33	@J	in the screenshot
2015-05-24 18:08:48	Yoshi2_	where in the screenshot?
2015-05-24 18:08:55	@J	middle left
2015-05-24 18:09:08	Yoshi2_	the "src" part?
2015-05-24 18:09:25	Yoshi2_	or the "current directory" part?
2015-05-24 18:09:27	@J	I mean, the label that says 'Current directory' in the screenshot
2015-05-24 18:09:27	@J	yeah
2015-05-24 18:09:55	@J	also, what's up with that face
2015-05-24 18:10:02	@J	it's got several noses or something
2015-05-24 18:11:33	@J	I'm thinking 'Working directory', but I don't know if it's clear it means the directory that relative paths used in this section are relative to
2015-05-24 18:12:03	@J	I mean, there'll be a help string, but if there's something better
2015-05-24 18:12:49	Yoshi2_	the face is supposed to look like this: http://i.imgur.com/S4HXChm.png
2015-05-24 18:13:47	@J	it does
2015-05-24 18:14:06	Yoshi2_	the head is in the middle, on the sides are his arms
2015-05-24 18:14:27	@J	oh, on yours it does actually look more like eyes and mouth
2015-05-24 18:14:35	@J	on mine the mouth line is more vertical and curved
2015-05-24 18:14:39	@J	looks like a trunk or something
2015-05-24 18:14:44	@J	with a moustache above it
2015-05-24 18:15:11	Yoshi2_	differences in fonts ruin such smileys
2015-05-24 18:18:50	Yoshi2_	hm, I'm having a hard time coming up with a shorter replacement for "current working directory" that means the same thing
2015-05-24 18:21:23	@J	I guess I'll go with working directory
2015-05-24 18:22:48	Yoshi2_	sounds good
2015-05-24 18:32:05	@J	http://i.imgur.com/CwZIoze.png
2015-05-24 18:38:58	@Espyo	"working directory" should work
2015-05-24 18:42:39	@J	BTW, I'm leaving soon and won't be around until probably Wednesday
2015-05-24 18:42:58	@J	ah, 'Probably Wednesday', my favourite day of the week
2015-05-24 18:49:39	@J	okay, going now, bype
2015-05-24 18:49:43	@J	...close enough

2015-05-25 23:51:04	@Espyo	I just gained 25fps by bypassing a single function call
2015-05-25 23:51:13	@Espyo	don't you DARE say function calls have no overhead, J
2015-05-25 23:51:33	@Espyo	or neglectible overhead, I think you said
2015-05-25 23:51:57	@Espyo	for every mob, for every other mob, get a certain event on the FSM
2015-05-25 23:52:08	@Espyo	I need to check 13 events at this moment
2015-05-25 23:52:15	@Espyo	so if there are 120 objects on the map
2015-05-25 23:52:20	@Espyo	 120 * 120 * 13 = a lot of calls
2015-05-25 23:52:39	@Espyo	just by switching from a function call to a slightly-more-complex piece of code that does it all right there
2015-05-25 23:52:41	@Espyo	I gained 25fps

2015-05-26 21:42:54	@J	sounds more like you need to optimise at a higher level
2015-05-26 21:43:05	@J	in lots of situations you can avoid checking everything against everything else
2015-05-26 21:43:20	@J	also I don't really know what a 25FPS gain means
2015-05-26 21:43:33	@J	if it started out at 0FPS, it's pretty good; if it started out at 1000, it's not
2015-05-26 21:45:47	@Espyo	I used a profiler
2015-05-26 21:45:53	@Espyo	that function call really is the bottleneck
2015-05-26 21:46:04	@Espyo	I already decreased the number of checks as far as I can
2015-05-26 21:46:12	@Espyo	hm, right
2015-05-26 21:46:16	@Espyo	well, went from 75fps to 100fps
2015-05-26 22:38:33	@J	I meant optimise the algorithm, not the code
2015-05-26 22:38:55	@J	oh, you did address that
2015-05-26 22:38:58	@J	well, if you say so
2015-05-26 22:39:13	@J	there are always clever things you can do
2015-05-26 22:39:47	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-26 22:39:52	@Espyo	I'm reaching the end of my rope here
2015-05-26 22:40:00	@Espyo	but as long as I'm on 100fps+, I think I can relax
2015-05-26 22:40:12	@Espyo	plus, this is all I'm going to do regarding "checking all mobs against all mobs"
2015-05-26 22:40:28	@Espyo	this is part of their logic FSM, so from this point, each mob does whatever
2015-05-26 22:40:34	@Espyo	doesn't need to check against any other mob ever again
2015-05-26 22:40:53	@Espyo	a bit off-topic, but I tried to make the Pikmin get knocked away when shaken
2015-05-26 22:40:59	@Espyo	but they weren't moving, so I kept increasing the value
2015-05-26 22:41:05	@Espyo	and then I realize I wasn't calling the function right
2015-05-26 22:41:16	@Espyo	and now that they are getting knocked back, the value was so high they got flung halfway across the map
2015-05-26 22:41:30	@Espyo	some of them even got sent to a pellet and took the chance to just carry it away
2015-05-26 22:42:45	@Espyo	all right, looks like the Splatoon wiki folk are really working hard on it
2015-05-26 22:42:50	@Espyo	we're going to import the images now
2015-05-26 22:42:54	@Espyo	and your bot is still the best choice
2015-05-26 22:43:09	@Espyo	I can't really remember if there was anything we had to worry about when using it...
2015-05-26 22:43:14	@Espyo	heck, I can't even remember HOW to use it

2015-05-27 21:35:47	@Espyo	right
2015-05-27 21:35:56	@Espyo	yeah, I saw from Testyo that it was just a ping timeout
2015-05-27 21:35:57	Testyo	all right, now hmm
2015-05-27 21:35:57	@Espyo	super weird
2015-05-27 21:35:58	@Espyo	oh well
2015-05-27 21:36:12	@Espyo	well, I gave it http://splatoonwiki.org/w/ for Inkipedia
2015-05-27 21:36:23	@Espyo	after that comes index.php, on Inkipedia
2015-05-27 21:36:44	@J	the stack trace is from using the source wiki
2015-05-27 21:37:35	@Espyo	hmm?
2015-05-27 21:38:14	@J	I mean, when it died it was parsing a response from the source wiki
2015-05-27 21:38:19	@J	which is the Wikia one, right?
2015-05-27 21:38:59	@Espyo	yeah
2015-05-27 21:39:02	@Espyo	right
2015-05-27 21:39:46	@J	so yeah, I don't know, works fine for me
2015-05-27 21:39:57	@Espyo	hmm, I guess I'll try again
2015-05-27 21:40:04	@Espyo	unless you changed fetch.py and such in the mean time
2015-05-27 21:40:06	@J	try putting in limit = 1 if you get the same issue again
2015-05-27 21:40:07	@Espyo	since I last got these files
2015-05-27 21:40:29	@J	http://ikn.org.uk/Python_modules you can compare here
2015-05-27 21:46:29	@Espyo	one upload works
2015-05-27 21:46:33	@Espyo	well, I do have permission denied
2015-05-27 21:46:36	@Espyo	but Prod's looking into it
2015-05-27 21:46:47	@Espyo	Prod also suggested a mass replace plugin we could install on Inkipedia
2015-05-27 21:46:54	@Espyo	and it reminded me how useful that could be on Pikipedia

2015-05-27 21:47:44	@J	I suspect it's a weird Windows thing with unicode characters then
2015-05-27 21:48:47	@Espyo	oof
2015-05-27 21:48:52	@Espyo	there goes that idea
2015-05-27 21:49:38	@J	try setting limit to 750
2015-05-27 21:49:44	@J	seems like the unicode ones start around there
2015-05-27 21:50:00	@J	I mean, just wait until it prints the filenames, see if it's happy enough to get that far
2015-05-27 21:51:03	@Espyo	well, the first one was .52 gal.png
2015-05-27 21:51:09	@Espyo	not really unicode shenanigans
2015-05-27 21:51:21	@Espyo	but it could be that the bot really has no permissions
2015-05-27 21:51:29	@Espyo	I think we had the same problem with EspyoBot
2015-05-27 21:53:25	@J	I'm not talking about the permissions errors, just trying to check for sure that it doesn't crash as early with limit 1 because later filenames have unicode
2015-05-27 21:54:38	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-05-27 21:54:40	@Espyo	good point
2015-05-27 21:55:57	@Espyo	well, it crashes while retrieving the 750 files

2015-05-30 14:38:20	Yoshi2	one thing I have noticed is that the lrt and pthread flags are not at the end in the resulting string, but to the left of the file names
2015-05-30 14:38:25	Yoshi2	no idea if that makes any difference
2015-05-30 14:40:02	@J	works fine for me
2015-05-30 14:40:21	Yoshi2	one thing I have noticed is that I looked at the file located at ./usr/include/linux/mman.h
2015-05-30 14:40:28	Yoshi2	and it looks nothing like this: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/mman.h
2015-05-30 14:42:30	@J	I thought you were including sys/mman, not linux/mman
2015-05-30 14:43:51	Yoshi2	you are right
2015-05-30 14:44:15	Yoshi2	but I'm not sure where I should look to find mman.h in a sys folder
2015-05-30 14:44:25	@J	/usr/include/sys/mman.h
2015-05-30 14:44:31	@J	that's where mine is
2015-05-30 14:44:38	@J	otherwise 'locate mman.h'
2015-05-30 14:46:56	Yoshi2	I... don't have a sys folder in include 
2015-05-30 14:46:58	Yoshi2	what the hell
2015-05-30 14:48:17	@J	it must be finding it because otherwise the error would be a compiler error, not a linker error
2015-05-30 14:50:47	Yoshi2	ah, it is in a whole different directory
2015-05-30 14:50:51	Yoshi2	well
2015-05-30 14:51:25	Yoshi2	include/i386-linux-gnu/sys
2015-05-30 14:52:03	@J	I've only seen paths like that when cross-compiling
2015-05-30 14:53:16	@J	but anyway, the issue's the linking, so make sure you have a librt.so and it's the right version in the right place
2015-05-30 14:58:53	@J	got to go, back in about an hour
2015-05-30 14:58:57	Yoshi2	see ya

2015-05-30 15:03:16	Yoshi2	the issue, not the solution
2015-05-30 15:03:30	Yoshi2	"gcc -lrt test.c" results in a success

2015-05-30 15:31:43	@Espyo	hi
2015-05-30 15:31:54	CyborgKing0	:|
2015-05-30 15:32:38	@Espyo	?
2015-05-30 15:35:36	CyborgKing0	How come in the background of amiibo advertisements and  amiibo tap, an amiibo with three Pikmin on it can be seen?
2015-05-30 15:35:53	CyborgKing0	We already have Olimar.
2015-05-30 15:36:30	@Espyo	I haven't checked yet
2015-05-30 15:36:33	@Espyo	do you have a link to the image?
2015-05-30 15:37:07	CyborgKing0	I put an image in the Forum.
2015-05-30 15:37:13	CyborgKing0	oh, wait.
2015-05-30 15:37:17	CyborgKing0	yah
2015-05-30 15:37:23	@Espyo	okay
2015-05-30 15:37:34	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-05-30 15:37:35	@Espyo	hm, how weird
2015-05-30 15:37:38	@Espyo	where'd you get that from?
2015-05-30 15:37:43	@Espyo	oh, never mind
2015-05-30 15:37:48	@Espyo	you just said, Amiibo Tap
2015-05-30 15:37:54	CyborgKing0	yep
2015-05-30 15:37:54	@Espyo	that's really weird
2015-05-30 15:37:59	@Espyo	it'd be nice
2015-05-30 15:38:02	@Espyo	and I don't really see why not
2015-05-30 15:38:07	@Espyo	I think E3 might tell us a bit more...
2015-05-30 15:38:10	CyborgKing0	What would it do?
2015-05-30 15:38:22	@Espyo	I'm guessing it'd work the same as Olimar
2015-05-30 15:38:31	@Espyo	so it's just an extra collection item
2015-05-30 15:38:45	CyborgKing0	Or maybe extra mission mode
2015-05-30 15:39:07	@Espyo	I wish
2015-05-30 15:39:14	@Espyo	but I think Nintendo might be done with Pikmin 3 DLC
2015-05-30 15:39:26	CyborgKing0	Probably.
2015-05-30 15:39:39	CyborgKing0	Maybe it'll work like the e-Reader?
2015-05-30 15:39:49	@Espyo	now that'd be neat
2015-05-30 15:40:07	@Espyo	still wish Pikmin 2-e wasn't absurdly difficult to get
2015-05-30 15:40:42	CyborgKing0	I don't own a gamecube though :|
2015-05-30 15:40:55	CyborgKing0	Nor Pikmin 2 in the Wii
2015-05-30 15:41:30	@Espyo	you should
2015-05-30 15:41:33	@Espyo	it's pretty great
2015-05-30 15:41:37	CyborgKing0	Ok.
2015-05-30 15:41:49	CyborgKing0	I do have the first game.
2015-05-30 15:41:58	CyborgKing0	and the third.
2015-05-30 15:42:00	@Espyo	nice
2015-05-30 15:42:31	CyborgKing0	I had to download the third game.
2015-05-30 15:42:49	@Espyo	same here
2015-05-30 15:42:51	CyborgKing0	Couldn't find the game in the store.
2015-05-30 15:42:54	@Espyo	because it was gifted to me by a friend
2015-05-30 15:44:50	CyborgKing0	Do you think the black and pink onions in Pikmin are the same as the rock and winged pikmin onions?
2015-05-30 15:47:30	CyborgKing0	Never mind.
2015-05-30 15:48:51	@Espyo	heh
2015-05-30 15:48:53	@Espyo	could be
2015-05-30 15:51:33	@J	Yoshi2: oh, I think it depends on your gcc version and system configuration
2015-05-30 15:51:44	@J	you should be able to fix it in the makefile by changing LDFLAGS to LDLIBS
2015-05-30 15:52:27	CyborgKing0	?
2015-05-30 15:52:48	@J	you can see how it works if you run 'make -p'
2015-05-30 15:52:58	@J	CyborgKing0: just replying to something Yoshi2 said an hour ago
2015-05-30 15:53:06	CyborgKing0	Ok.
2015-05-30 15:53:26	@J	BTW: 'make -p' is the most useful thing to know, but I've never seen it in a make tutorial
2015-05-30 15:53:35	@J	it should be one of the first things every tutorial mentions
2015-05-30 15:54:58	@J	anyway, I think LDLIBS is where it's meant to go, so it might be worth asking whoever set you the work, if you care enough

2015-05-30 16:03:03	CyborgKing0	Why do you think some Pikmin are still alive when their Onion is dormant?
2015-05-30 16:04:32	Yoshi2	isn't the onion mostly a place for the Pikmin to hide in?
2015-05-30 16:05:00	CyborgKing0	Yeah...
2015-05-30 16:05:25	Yoshi2	so they might just be lucky enough to not be eaten by any monsters
2015-05-30 16:05:58	CyborgKing0	Maybe the onion is an actual organism and it creates workers so it can gather nutrients.

2015-05-30 16:06:45	CyborgKing0	Maybe something like a queen ant?
2015-05-30 16:07:28	Yoshi2	from a gameplay perspective though, Nintendo probably simply wants you to see what the new pikmin you just found look like
2015-05-30 16:08:41	CyborgKing0	Why is the grey onion in a crystal?
2015-05-30 16:09:03	CyborgKing0	Seems weird.
2015-05-30 16:10:12	CyborgKing0	Crystal spitting blowhog?
2015-05-30 16:10:12	Yoshi2	some things aren't meant to make sense
2015-05-30 16:11:09	CyborgKing0	gtg bye

2015-05-30 16:11:58	Yoshi2	J: you're right, it works just fine if I put it in LDLIBS without changing anything else
2015-05-30 16:13:36	Yoshi2	makes me question the competence of the people coming up with our homework
2015-05-30 16:13:42	Yoshi2	(or they actually want to mess with us)
2015-05-30 16:15:30	@J	I have encountered that issue before, but apparently it doesn't affect me any more
2015-05-30 16:15:43	@J	so maybe it just doesn't affect many setups
2015-05-30 16:21:26	Yoshi2	J: make -p is insane
2015-05-30 16:21:32	Yoshi2	so much information
2015-05-30 16:22:45	Yoshi2	there is a lot of information about things that aren't a target
2015-05-30 16:25:34	@J	it's just all the definitions and implicit rules that exist in a makefile before you write anything
2015-05-30 16:26:07	@J	so if you look up the '%: %.o' rule, you can see the order of LINK.c (which contains LDFLAGS) and LDLIBS
2015-05-30 16:26:11	@J	$^ being the .o file
2015-05-30 18:02:44	Yoshi2	the documentation for all those C functions is quite decent
2015-05-30 18:02:59	Yoshi2	but I feel like I'm starting from 0 again every time I encounter a new function to learn about

2015-05-30 20:58:25	@PikFan	ugh, fanon doesn't have a root category
2015-05-30 20:58:51	@PikFan	is there a special page somewhere for categories that aren't categorized
2015-05-30 20:59:15	@PikFan	more importantly, is there a special pages for uncategorized articles
2015-05-30 20:59:19	@PikFan	*page
2015-05-30 20:59:53	@PikFan	wait, found uncategorized categories
2015-05-30 21:00:05	@PikFan	...found the other one, too
2015-05-30 21:00:06	@PikFan	silly me
2015-05-30 21:01:55	@PikFan	I think what I'll do is make a root category with 2 subcategories: one for the content, one for the wiki
2015-05-30 21:02:23	@PikFan	the wiki category will contain templates, policies, forums, users, etc
2015-05-30 21:02:44	@PikFan	the content category will contain all the fan stuff
2015-05-30 21:04:37	@PikFan	...what http://www.pikminfanon.com/Category:Articles_with_conjectural_titles

2015-05-30 21:09:47	@PikFan	wait, wouldn't files be classified as a type of content?
2015-05-30 21:10:16	@PikFan	...that was worded badly
2015-05-30 21:10:26	@PikFan	couldn't they be considered a form of content?
