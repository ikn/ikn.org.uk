2016-01-16 00:35:45	StarWolf	I'M A TUBBY PURPLE, YAY
2016-01-16 00:36:02	Scruffy	brb
2016-01-16 00:36:05	En_Passant	at least post the extended versions
2016-01-16 00:36:53	StarWolf	En_Passant ???
2016-01-16 00:36:56	En_Passant	https://youtu.be/6i21Jxx257k
2016-01-16 00:37:11	En_Passant	How does half an hour sound?
2016-01-16 00:37:19	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-01-16 00:37:39	Neocraftz1553	Well, actually that is great for listening while working
2016-01-16 00:38:12	StarWolf	it is.
2016-01-16 00:38:14	En_Passant	Sadly, this channel has very little in the Pikmin department
2016-01-16 00:39:09	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-16 00:39:20	StarWolf	It's fine. As long as I can listen to Demon Lord NineTail's theme, i'm happy XD
2016-01-16 00:39:52	@PikFan	this would be a good boss theme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgvBYs_c1A
2016-01-16 00:40:02	@PikFan	fighting something scary powerful
2016-01-16 00:40:28	StarWolf	i think it is a boss theme
2016-01-16 00:40:30	@PikFan	the beginning part would be like the scene leading up to the battle
2016-01-16 00:40:39	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:41:12	StarWolf	it is a boss theme. Tales of Hearts is a DS game XD
2016-01-16 00:41:15	Neocraftz1553	if it is a boss theme, than it is made for that purpose
2016-01-16 00:42:03	@PikFan	it's actually an arranged theme
2016-01-16 00:42:12	@PikFan	"This is a rare arranged soundtrack for Tales of Hearts. It comes with the preorder of the CG edition of the game. Enjoy!"
2016-01-16 00:42:54	StarWolf	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoqR9Bwx1Y I THINK I FOUND THE BEST BOSS THEME EVER XD
2016-01-16 00:42:59	En_Passant	 2:16 is when it gets real
2016-01-16 00:43:33	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-01-16 00:43:40	Neocraftz1553	I remember whwn I had a bomb rock, I threw a yellow pikmin in the middle of my squad and whistled it back, it dropped it and all of them died
2016-01-16 00:43:48	@PikFan	ouch
2016-01-16 00:43:51	Neocraftz1553	a random moment from my gameplay
2016-01-16 00:44:01	Neocraftz1553	of P1
2016-01-16 00:44:16	@PikFan	one time in P3, I was playing on Twilight River
2016-01-16 00:44:17	StarWolf	I remember being scared of the forest navel  
2016-01-16 00:44:38	Neocraftz1553	heh yeah
2016-01-16 00:44:40	@PikFan	I was near the Burgeoning Spiderwort in the first part of the area, and the Pikmin were carrying the berries back
2016-01-16 00:44:46	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 00:44:54	@PikFan	when all of a sudden they JUMP across the river and to the other side
2016-01-16 00:45:07	@PikFan	they didn't even use the lilypads
2016-01-16 00:45:10	StarWolf	whAT
2016-01-16 00:45:12	@PikFan	they just /jumped/
2016-01-16 00:45:13	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:45:23	@PikFan	I...was astonished
2016-01-16 00:45:44	StarWolf	hey, pikmin idea! Juming pikmin!
2016-01-16 00:45:55	En_Passant	Yellows?
2016-01-16 00:46:05	@PikFan	I think they were Reds
2016-01-16 00:46:12	@PikFan	I have no idea how or why it happened
2016-01-16 00:46:32	@PikFan	but since that one time I've never seen it before
2016-01-16 00:46:32	StarWolf	glitches are weird :/
2016-01-16 00:46:33	Neocraftz1553	I hope Nintendo is going to add another area in P4 that has a glopmy atmosphere like Forest Navel
2016-01-16 00:46:45	@PikFan	if it happens again maybe I'll add it to the glitches page
2016-01-16 00:46:51	StarWolf	yes. that would be the best
2016-01-16 00:47:01	En_Passant	Well, it was a cave
2016-01-16 00:47:34	StarWolf	What if it's a houce in Pikmin 4?
2016-01-16 00:47:35	Neocraftz1553	no, but a full-on area, not a small cave
2016-01-16 00:48:00	Neocraftz1553	a house would be a bit like the christmas challenge mode area
2016-01-16 00:48:30	En_Passant	Oh, yeah. That would be cool. That's why I have one in my game
2016-01-16 00:48:38	StarWolf	except gloomy and rotting  
2016-01-16 00:48:46	Neocraftz1553	mossy
2016-01-16 00:48:58	Neocraftz1553	hey, Scruffy, you still here?
2016-01-16 00:49:30	StarWolf	basically, if they add a house, I want something strait from fall out
2016-01-16 00:49:41	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 00:50:16	Scruffy	Here
2016-01-16 00:50:17	Neocraftz1553	I actually prefer more natural enviroments, but a house is also cool.
2016-01-16 00:50:22	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 00:50:40	StarWolf	a house + garden/yard combo?
2016-01-16 00:50:55	Scruffy	Sorry, I had some tickets to order
2016-01-16 00:51:17	Neocraftz1553	heh, its fine
2016-01-16 00:51:25	Neocraftz1553	that would be nice
2016-01-16 00:51:25	StarWolf	really? cool!
2016-01-16 00:52:00	Neocraftz1553	maybe you could get the fruit growing on the garden plants, or a treasure on top of a small stump
2016-01-16 00:52:03	@PikFan	wait no
2016-01-16 00:52:09	@PikFan	they weren't carrying berries
2016-01-16 00:52:16	@PikFan	they were carrying fragments
2016-01-16 00:52:24	Scruffy	I always thought a greenhouse would make a pretty cool Pikmin area
2016-01-16 00:52:32	@PikFan	 2014-04-06 21:41:41	@PikFan	ok, so here's what happened
2016-01-16 00:52:34	Scruffy	A nice mix of natural and manmade
2016-01-16 00:52:42	@PikFan	 2014-04-06 21:41:58	@PikFan	two Pikmin are holding Fragments, waiting for a Lily Pad to come
2016-01-16 00:52:44	@PikFan	 2014-04-06 21:42:00	@PikFan	it does
2016-01-16 00:52:44	StarWolf	They jumped the bridge so that they wouldn't have to work XD
2016-01-16 00:52:52	@PikFan	 2014-04-06 21:42:16	@PikFan	but then they jump super high in the air, all the way to the other side of the river
2016-01-16 00:53:12	StarWolf	whAAAA
2016-01-16 00:53:49	@PikFan	yeah, from what I remember they jumped from one of the "docks" to the other
2016-01-16 00:53:52	Scruffy	If only they weren't embarrassed to jump that high whenever a leader wanted them to
2016-01-16 00:53:52	Neocraftz1553	obviously, they drank some kind of super sugary nectar or something
2016-01-16 00:54:13	StarWolf	Or are half-winged
2016-01-16 00:54:16	@PikFan	I still don't know why it happened but it was incredible
2016-01-16 00:54:27	Scruffy	Oh, since there are so many here
2016-01-16 00:54:49	Scruffy	I was wondering if you guys could offer some input on a decision I need to make about my next big Pikmin project
2016-01-16 00:54:53	StarWolf	They're the Incredibles! 
2016-01-16 00:54:59	StarWolf	okay
2016-01-16 00:55:01	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 00:55:05	@PikFan	heh, neat
2016-01-16 00:55:08	@PikFan	sure, what is it?
2016-01-16 00:55:13	Scruffy	Option 1
2016-01-16 00:55:28	Scruffy	An orchestral medley of all three Pikmin final boss themes
2016-01-16 00:55:32	Scruffy	or Option 2
2016-01-16 00:56:23	Scruffy	A fully realized edit of Pikmin 2 in which you play with harder enemies, harder constraints, and all at night rather than during the day
2016-01-16 00:56:37	Scruffy	Basically night mode for Pikmin 2
2016-01-16 00:56:39	@PikFan	wait...
2016-01-16 00:57:00	@PikFan	how would you do Option 2?!
2016-01-16 00:57:04	En_Passant	I thought you weren't much of a programmer, Scruffy
2016-01-16 00:57:04	StarWolf	Option one. I could actually survive that. 
2016-01-16 00:57:06	Neocraftz1553	does the 2nd option have pictures? If so, how many?
2016-01-16 00:57:18	Scruffy	I recently discovered I can edit Pikmin 2 files
2016-01-16 00:57:20	@PikFan	I mean, that'd be /fantastic/, but... it seems like a huge undertaking
2016-01-16 00:57:22	Scruffy	I'm not much of a programmer
2016-01-16 00:57:25	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-01-16 00:57:40	Scruffy	But I can read the files and finally translate them from Japanese
2016-01-16 00:58:00	@PikFan	urgh
2016-01-16 00:58:01	StarWolf	cool!
2016-01-16 00:58:05	En_Passant	So you actually know what they do? I thought even the data miners couldn't figure it out
2016-01-16 00:58:11	@PikFan	I wish I knew more Japanese so I could translate them myself
2016-01-16 00:58:11	Neocraftz1553	option two sounds cool
2016-01-16 00:58:12	StarWolf	but it'd be hard
2016-01-16 00:58:28	Scruffy	I've already figured out how to swap out enemies, change lighting, change gravity, change the day's length, and change the debt amount
2016-01-16 00:58:40	Scruffy	It would be hard
2016-01-16 00:58:57	Scruffy	That's why I don't really want to do both at once, even though both are exciting for me
2016-01-16 00:58:58	Neocraftz1553	yeah option 2
2016-01-16 00:59:11	En_Passant	Option 2 for me too
2016-01-16 00:59:33	En_Passant	I would honestly prefer to have those re-orchestrations separate from each other
2016-01-16 00:59:37	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy, how often will you work on it though?
2016-01-16 00:59:39	Scruffy	True
2016-01-16 00:59:46	@PikFan	wait so you mean you know how these work http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:P2_enemy_technical
2016-01-16 01:00:12	@PikFan	ahhh
2016-01-16 01:00:33	@PikFan	if only we had someone who was good with textures, then we could retexture Pikmin 2 and make it HD...
2016-01-16 01:00:55	@PikFan	kinda like that Twilight Princess HD fan project
2016-01-16 01:01:04	@PikFan	oh, speaking of
2016-01-16 01:01:13	Neocraftz1553	I am semi-good with textures... but not THAT good
2016-01-16 01:01:31	@PikFan	I recently heard that the official TPHD is getting a new dungeon, but you need the Wolf Link amiibo to access it
2016-01-16 01:01:58	Scruffy	I was trying to do that with Blender
2016-01-16 01:02:01	Scruffy	I got through a few
2016-01-16 01:02:06	Scruffy	But there are /so/ many
2016-01-16 01:02:08	En_Passant	Isn't that a rumor?
2016-01-16 01:02:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah there are tons of textures
2016-01-16 01:02:39	Scruffy	Anyway I can't yet access the individual enemy properties yet
2016-01-16 01:02:45	Scruffy	minus one yet
2016-01-16 01:03:02	Scruffy	Just what enemies go where
2016-01-16 01:03:11	Neocraftz1553	I gues I could try to help you out with the textures a little scruffy, then I xould send it to you for revising
2016-01-16 01:03:19	En_Passant	Espyo made a short video where he showed off some edited enemy properties
2016-01-16 01:03:30	Scruffy	But so far I fought an emperor bulblax in Emergence Cave sublevel 1
2016-01-16 01:03:31	Neocraftz1553	he did?
2016-01-16 01:04:12	En_Passant	https://youtu.be/XeSb5-PMC3g
2016-01-16 01:04:23	Scruffy	The only problem is the files for enemies are called .szs, and the application for SZS viewing is for Windows
2016-01-16 01:04:39	Scruffy	I can try emulating it but I've had trouble so far
2016-01-16 01:05:23	StarWolf	Oh. Also, I don't mean to stray from the conversation, but I need more help... this time with an area name. 
2016-01-16 01:06:01	Neocraftz1553	which area?
2016-01-16 01:06:33	StarWolf	It's a Jungle Area... But a bit more... special. 
2016-01-16 01:06:58	Neocraftz1553	give a bit more details plz
2016-01-16 01:08:23	StarWolf	Okay, so imagine the Quaggled Mireclops, but a million times bigger with much more flora and you've got both the area and it's boss.
2016-01-16 01:08:54	Neocraftz1553	The Living Swamp?
2016-01-16 01:09:27	StarWolf	Yah, except it's a Jungle, not a swamp.
2016-01-16 01:09:49	En_Passant	Sentient Jungle
2016-01-16 01:09:50	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 01:10:03	Scruffy	That's great
2016-01-16 01:10:06	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 01:10:33	StarWolf	Yeah! I like it :3
2016-01-16 01:10:48	@PikFan	I feel "jungle" is too bland of a word, but that's just me
2016-01-16 01:10:56	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 01:11:09	En_Passant	Yeah, I agree PikFan
2016-01-16 01:11:22	Scruffy	I feel it kind of works here, but I suppose
2016-01-16 01:11:26	En_Passant	oh, I know
2016-01-16 01:11:28	En_Passant	Sentient Moor
2016-01-16 01:11:29	Neocraftz1553	Just search up synonyms
2016-01-16 01:11:49	En_Passant	The Mireclops isn't much of a jungle
2016-01-16 01:11:52	Neocraftz1553	Nintwndo is good with area names
2016-01-16 01:12:17	StarWolf	okay. I'm just still bothered with what I came up with to kill it... 
2016-01-16 01:12:21	Scruffy	Mire is a swamp
2016-01-16 01:12:37	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, it is more swampish to me
2016-01-16 01:12:57	Neocraftz1553	Its a Quagmire
2016-01-16 01:14:17	StarWolf	What about a Synonym for a different use of Jungle like...  Sentient Mess?
2016-01-16 01:14:46	StarWolf	or... um...
2016-01-16 01:14:50	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 01:15:46	StarWolf	Tangle of [Insert word here]
2016-01-16 01:16:47	Neocraftz1553	nah, Sentient Jungle works
2016-01-16 01:16:51	En_Passant	just don't call it the Tanglewood
2016-01-16 01:17:00	@PikFan	Tanglewood?
2016-01-16 01:17:08	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 01:17:30	Neocraftz1553	sounds good for an area with part jungle, pat forest attributes
2016-01-16 01:17:36	Neocraftz1553	*part forest
2016-01-16 01:17:47	StarWolf	Yes! I lake that PikFan / En_Passant X3
2016-01-16 01:18:04	En_Passant	That wasn't sarcasm
2016-01-16 01:18:04	@PikFan	what's the Tanglewood, En_Passant
2016-01-16 01:18:15	En_Passant	It's an area in Golden Sun
2016-01-16 01:18:18	Neocraftz1553	no, it wasnt En_Passant
2016-01-16 01:18:25	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-16 01:18:29	@PikFan	copyright
2016-01-16 01:18:33	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-16 01:18:36	Neocraftz1553	"I lake that"
2016-01-16 01:18:48	Scruffy	It's also a music venue in Massachussetts
2016-01-16 01:18:48	StarWolf	dangit...
2016-01-16 01:18:51	Neocraftz1553	yeah, gotta avoid copyright
2016-01-16 01:18:52	Scruffy	A very popular one
2016-01-16 01:19:04	Scruffy	There are three music schools based on it
2016-01-16 01:19:15	StarWolf	why does the universe hate me? Okay, lets see here...
2016-01-16 01:19:31	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 01:19:57	En_Passant	I said NOT to name it that...
2016-01-16 01:20:10	@PikFan	they're not
2016-01-16 01:20:36	@PikFan	and it's fine, I had troubles coming up with new names for my new areas in PCW
2016-01-16 01:20:45	@PikFan	so I know how you feel
2016-01-16 01:20:47	StarWolf	here's the synonyms I found: wilderness, complexity, confusion, complication, chaos, mess; labyrinth, maze, tangle, and web
2016-01-16 01:21:32	Scruffy	How about the Wrathful Wetland?
2016-01-16 01:21:37	Neocraftz1553	some of those just dont make sense... like confusion, chaos, and mess
2016-01-16 01:22:03	@PikFan	ooh
2016-01-16 01:22:06	Neocraftz1553	unless it is a jungle overrun by vines
2016-01-16 01:22:21	StarWolf	I like that one, Scruffy
2016-01-16 01:22:36	StarWolf	yah... cus it's the boss and all...
2016-01-16 01:23:26	StarWolf	Cool! So I've got the name, Wrathful Wetland, and now I just need a better idea as of how the boss will go down... :')
2016-01-16 01:23:44	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-01-16 01:23:50	Neocraftz1553	what if...
2016-01-16 01:23:51	Scruffy	PikFan and I had this sort of idea when the Lunar Long Legs was still a boss
2016-01-16 01:24:06	Scruffy	To defeat it, you could go inside it using a cave, and defeat it from inside
2016-01-16 01:24:20	Neocraftz1553	hey, scruffy, does lunar long legs have an article
2016-01-16 01:24:55	StarWolf	That was like my idea.... you would go inside it and break it's heart.
2016-01-16 01:25:35	Neocraftz1553	but... what if the area dissapeared and turned to a lake on the map selection when defeated?
2016-01-16 01:25:37	@PikFan	well that's a nice way of putting it
2016-01-16 01:25:45	@PikFan	@StarWolf
2016-01-16 01:25:52	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 01:25:52	StarWolf	I know XD 
2016-01-16 01:26:01	En_Passant	I imagine it would die and go back to being just an area
2016-01-16 01:26:12	@PikFan	Neocraftz1553: yes http://www.pikminfanon.com/Lunar_Long_Legs
2016-01-16 01:26:17	Scruffy	The Lunar Long Legs is now unused
2016-01-16 01:26:39	Scruffy	Because it couldn't physically exist
2016-01-16 01:26:46	StarWolf	Yes. It will also open more of the area, and weird vines blocked off much of it. 
2016-01-16 01:27:03	Scruffy	ooh, that's a cool idea
2016-01-16 01:28:00	StarWolf	but the whole "breaking it's heart to kill it" thing still freaks me out...
2016-01-16 01:28:15	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2016-01-16 01:56:11	Neocraftz1553	I might move on to P2 after I complete it.... then P3... which will be twice as hard

2016-01-16 01:56:54	Neocraftz1553	I would love Nintendo to remake those in the wii u
2016-01-16 01:56:57	En_Passant	Hate to be the negative nelly, but Nintendo would pursue legal action over that

2016-01-16 01:57:24	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-01-16 01:58:07	En_Passant	ugh, I have to write a 250 word statement about why I fit a college's flagship program

2016-01-16 01:58:24	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 01:58:28	StarWolf	NP :) 
2016-01-16 01:58:40	@PikFan	well, that fan TPHD is going pretty smoothly and Nintendo hasn't said anything
2016-01-16 01:58:53	Neocraftz1553	true.. 
2016-01-16 01:59:00	@PikFan	Pikmin is much more obscure than Zelda, so if anything, it'd be even less likely to be found
2016-01-16 01:59:01	En_Passant	SM64HD was C&D'd, I'm pretty sure
2016-01-16 01:59:09	StarWolf	Also, not to get of topic AGAIN, but is there curntly a "community Project"?
2016-01-16 01:59:16	@PikFan	kinda
2016-01-16 01:59:23	Neocraftz1553	yeah, kinda
2016-01-16 01:59:25	StarWolf	what is it?
2016-01-16 01:59:37	Neocraftz1553	idk
2016-01-16 01:59:46	En_Passant	Is it the clean-up?
2016-01-16 02:00:12	@PikFan	I think he means like a community fangame
2016-01-16 02:00:26	Neocraftz1553	Nintendo shouldn't Copyright it as long as it is not sold.... but if they see a slight difference in their sales they might copyright it...
2016-01-16 02:00:43	StarWolf	If you're refering to me, I'm a girl. And yes, i do mean a game
2016-01-16 02:00:51	@PikFan	StarWolf: yeah, see here http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_Community_Fangame
2016-01-16 02:01:06	StarWolf	I can't click the link
2016-01-16 02:01:23	En_Passant	Doesn't look like that project's going very well
2016-01-16 02:01:28	StarWolf	It'll kick me out of chat
2016-01-16 02:01:57	En_Passant	You must have one of those Mac mouses with only one button

2016-01-16 02:02:40	StarWolf	but i was just wodering because i have a comunity game idea
2016-01-16 02:03:22	Neocraftz1553	I guess I'll help out the project a bit, brb

2016-01-16 02:03:56	En_Passant	Weren't we going to talk about Scruffy's story?
2016-01-16 02:04:03	@PikFan	oh yeah...
2016-01-16 02:04:16	StarWolf	Story?
2016-01-16 02:04:48	Scruffy	I'm writing a history of Louie as told by Louie at the current end of the canonical series
2016-01-16 02:05:00	Scruffy	It's spoilers about the end of Pikmin 3, if anyone is concerned
2016-01-16 02:05:24	StarWolf	Oh, that's cool! He probably talks bad about the koppaits tho hah
2016-01-16 02:05:45	Scruffy	Is everyone cool with the end of Pikmin 3?
2016-01-16 02:05:51	StarWolf	yah'
2016-01-16 02:05:53	@PikFan	yes

2016-01-16 02:08:50	Neocraftz1553	oh yes
2016-01-16 02:08:54	Scruffy	Cool
2016-01-16 02:09:01	Scruffy	Yes, he talks bad about just about everyone
2016-01-16 02:09:05	Neocraftz1553	sorry, I was on the CF
2016-01-16 02:09:13	Scruffy	He got left on PNF-404 /twice/
2016-01-16 02:09:26	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 02:09:29	Scruffy	And not out of emergency or anything, it was just negligence
2016-01-16 02:09:52	Scruffy	So there's that, and just trying to envision the mindset of a character like Louie
2016-01-16 02:09:58	StarWolf	Yah, poor louie
2016-01-16 02:10:09	Scruffy	Plus, I'm really excited about writing what happens in the Dream Den
2016-01-16 02:10:30	StarWolf	that'd be cool
2016-01-16 02:10:40	Scruffy	I've got a really good idea for it
2016-01-16 02:10:51	Neocraftz1553	yes?
2016-01-16 02:11:29	Scruffy	I guess I'll tell you guys
2016-01-16 02:11:35	Scruffy	I can't keep it to myself
2016-01-16 02:12:29	Scruffy	The Titan Dweevil is a lot more intelligent than it seems
2016-01-16 02:13:02	StarWolf	really?
2016-01-16 02:13:04	En_Passant	What do you mean?
2016-01-16 02:13:10	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-01-16 02:13:10	En_Passant	Because it can use tools?
2016-01-16 02:13:16	Scruffy	Yes, firstly
2016-01-16 02:13:26	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-16 02:13:41	Scruffy	At the end of the day it just wants treasure on its back for the sake of treasure, to ward off enemies and hunt prey
2016-01-16 02:14:18	En_Passant	I thought it was just distracted by shiny objects
2016-01-16 02:14:23	Scruffy	The Titan Dweevil Olimar and the President fight was resting in its den, but often it will emerge from its lair to hunt
2016-01-16 02:14:26	Scruffy	It is
2016-01-16 02:15:02	@PikFan	can it actually eat things?
2016-01-16 02:15:04	Scruffy	In that way it's a little like a trapdoor spider
2016-01-16 02:15:19	Neocraftz1553	oh, that is awsome
2016-01-16 02:15:26	StarWolf	cool
2016-01-16 02:15:29	Scruffy	Yes, it can eat things
2016-01-16 02:15:41	@PikFan	nice
2016-01-16 02:15:56	Scruffy	Louie /could/ have been eaten
2016-01-16 02:16:08	StarWolf	Woah
2016-01-16 02:16:14	StarWolf	thats scary
2016-01-16 02:16:14	Scruffy	But he resists mentally
2016-01-16 02:16:21	Scruffy	The thing is
2016-01-16 02:16:30	Scruffy	The Titan Dweevil is also telekinetic
2016-01-16 02:16:42	Scruffy	Wait, no
2016-01-16 02:16:42	StarWolf	what?
2016-01-16 02:16:44	Scruffy	Telepathic
2016-01-16 02:16:48	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 02:17:00	Neocraftz1553	very similer word
2016-01-16 02:17:03	Scruffy	It can communicate with other creatures simply from mind to mind
2016-01-16 02:17:05	Neocraftz1553	*words
2016-01-16 02:17:48	Scruffy	Using this it can both coerce creatures into finding treasure for it, and mesmerize them into its lair to be eaten
2016-01-16 02:18:27	En_Passant	Can't it just kidnap them?
2016-01-16 02:18:47	Scruffy	Well, I wanted to make the Titan Dweevil a character with whom Louie communicates
2016-01-16 02:20:01	@PikFan	"Don't listen to them. They're silly. You're right to be angry. They left you and abandoned you, so why would you want to go back?"
2016-01-16 02:20:13	Scruffy	Exactly
2016-01-16 02:20:25	En_Passant	It seems like it would be simpler to have them in a symbiotic relationship
2016-01-16 02:20:46	@PikFan	I like the telepathic idea
2016-01-16 02:20:47	En_Passant	The Titan Dweevil protects Louie, Louie helps the Dweevil with food and treasures
2016-01-16 02:20:57	Scruffy	That's eventually what they do
2016-01-16 02:21:13	Scruffy	But I wanted the two to communicate, to dialogue
2016-01-16 02:21:30	En_Passant	And it has to be verbal communication?
2016-01-16 02:21:50	Scruffy	And having such a freakish creature as the Titan Dweevil just verbally speak plain Hocotatian/English is a little silly

2016-01-16 02:22:13	Scruffy	That calls itself the King of Bugs
2016-01-16 02:22:30	Neocraftz1553	ohh, thats interesting
2016-01-16 02:24:15	Scruffy	I probably shouldn't reveal any more
2016-01-16 02:24:20	Scruffy	But what do you guys think?
2016-01-16 02:24:23	Scruffy	Does that hold up?
2016-01-16 02:24:32	@PikFan	I like the dynamic that develops
2016-01-16 02:24:49	@PikFan	also I think it's interesting that the Titan Dweevil actually can hunt and eat things
2016-01-16 02:24:55	@PikFan	definitely adds to its fear factor
2016-01-16 02:25:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I think it is cool
2016-01-16 02:25:15	@PikFan	brb
2016-01-16 02:25:18	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 02:25:21	Scruffy	okay
2016-01-16 02:25:26	Scruffy	En_Passant?
2016-01-16 02:26:24	En_Passant	I've already stated my objections to it being telepathic
2016-01-16 02:26:36	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 02:26:48	Scruffy	Yeah...
2016-01-16 02:27:02	Scruffy	Perhaps it's not telepathic at all
2016-01-16 02:27:17	Neocraftz1553	maybe its all in louies head
2016-01-16 02:27:18	Scruffy	Perhaps Louie just anthropomorphizes the Titan Dweevil
2016-01-16 02:27:22	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-16 02:27:39	Scruffy	out of non compis mentis
2016-01-16 02:27:58	Scruffy	compos*
2016-01-16 02:28:10	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-16 02:28:45	En_Passant	He played with bugs all the time when he was little, right?
2016-01-16 02:28:49	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-16 02:28:59	En_Passant	I figured we would've just studied them and learned how they communicate
2016-01-16 02:29:01	En_Passant	*he
2016-01-16 02:29:13	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-16 02:29:27	Scruffy	That could work as well
2016-01-16 02:29:49	Scruffy	Although the Titan Dweevil communicating normally wouldn't have much intelligible to say to Louie
2016-01-16 02:30:12	En_Passant	Perhaps Louie initiated the relationship
2016-01-16 02:30:34	En_Passant	Knowing from Olimar that he doesn't stand a chance on the planet's surface at night
2016-01-16 02:31:00	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-16 02:31:24	Scruffy	He enters the Dream Den to wait out the night
2016-01-16 02:32:15	Scruffy	And meets the Titan Dweevil, but isn't afraid because he knows how to communicate with it
2016-01-16 02:32:45	Scruffy	In fact, he might see it as more of a friendly guardian creature than how one would normally react to it
2016-01-16 02:36:19	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-16 02:38:20	@PikFan	back
2016-01-16 02:38:25	Neocraftz1553	hey
2016-01-16 02:38:27	Scruffy	Hey
2016-01-16 02:38:36	@PikFan	I don't see why the TD being telepathic is such an issue
2016-01-16 02:38:48	@PikFan	I like the idea, it sounds fun
2016-01-16 02:39:17	@PikFan	even if most creatures on the planet are depicted as unintelligent mindless creatures
2016-01-16 02:39:35	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 02:40:34	En_Passant	Occam's Razor, mostly
2016-01-16 02:41:11	En_Passant	Sure, it could be telepathic, or it could have a more realistic and natural explanation
2016-01-16 02:41:30	@PikFan	:\
2016-01-16 02:41:44	En_Passant	(Actually, that might not be Occam's Razor now that I think about it)
2016-01-16 02:41:53	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2016-01-16 02:41:54	Neocraftz1553	like being telepathic?
2016-01-16 02:42:04	@PikFan	it's a similar idea, but Occam's Razor is used for science
2016-01-16 02:42:24	Scruffy	Occam's razor simplifies assumptions about the explanation, not changes the explanation to something simpler
2016-01-16 02:44:05	En_Passant	It's used to evaluate explanation based on the assumptions used in it, right?
2016-01-16 02:44:18	@PikFan	if you ask me, telepathy seems simpler than some sort of explanation that allows them to communicate
2016-01-16 02:44:34	@PikFan	...provided that there's no explanation for how telepathy works, of course
2016-01-16 02:44:43	@PikFan	in which case, the natural one would likely be simpler

2016-01-16 02:46:21	En_Passant	Telepathy hasn't been introduced as an element in the series, so you would probably need to explain it
2016-01-16 02:46:32	Scruffy	Well, actually I suppose it's a little forced to just give the Titan Dweevil telepathy
2016-01-16 02:46:43	Scruffy	When I have a disturbed character who could do it of his own volition
2016-01-16 02:46:44	Neocraftz1553	It IS just a story...

2016-01-16 02:48:48	@PikFan	not everything has to be completely realistic
2016-01-16 02:49:40	@PikFan	 18:46	Scruffy	When I have a disturbed character who could do it of his own volition
2016-01-16 02:49:44	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2016-01-16 02:49:55	@PikFan	the Ship does hint that he hacked the TD's mind
2016-01-16 02:50:06	Scruffy	Louie could project the idea of a friendly caregiver on the Titan Dweevil

2016-01-16 02:58:16	Neocraftz1553	What did I miss
2016-01-16 02:58:54	Scruffy	Not much, we're just trying to figure out what the Titan Dweevil should do to form a connection with Louie
2016-01-16 02:59:04	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-16 02:59:12	Scruffy	And now I'm beginning to think it's Louie who should start the connection
2016-01-16 02:59:17	Scruffy	Not that he's telepathic
2016-01-16 02:59:38	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 03:00:08	Neocraftz1553	he should offer the Titan Dweevel some food/treasure
2016-01-16 03:00:15	Scruffy	perhaps
2016-01-16 03:01:32	Neocraftz1553	it wouldn't make much sense for a hunter like the Titan Dweevil to adopt potential prey
2016-01-16 03:03:09	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-16 03:03:45	Scruffy	That's why I thought Louie somehow resisted the Titan Dweevil in a way other prey had not done
2016-01-16 03:03:54	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-01-16 03:03:56	Scruffy	Which is why I thought it would be a mental struggle

2016-01-16 04:28:24	@PikFan	why?

2016-01-16 04:28:33	En_Passant	Just curious
2016-01-16 04:28:33	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-16 04:28:56	@PikFan	I'm so lazy
2016-01-16 04:29:08	En_Passant	I seem to have phases on which series I'm motivated to work on
2016-01-16 04:29:11	@PikFan	I have all these ideas yet I'm never motivated enough to flesh them out more
2016-01-16 04:29:29	@PikFan	so motivation is a common problem, then
2016-01-16 04:29:35	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-16 04:29:56	@PikFan	the problem is, there's nothing that would motivate me
2016-01-16 04:30:03	En_Passant	Same
2016-01-16 04:30:12	@PikFan	except for a crowd of clamoring fans, but I don't have that
2016-01-16 04:30:21	En_Passant	Even playing through Pikmin 3 only got me thinking about it for a day or so
2016-01-16 04:30:33	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-01-16 04:30:45	@PikFan	oh, how did you like its Mission Mode?
2016-01-16 04:30:53	En_Passant	It's hard
2016-01-16 04:31:02	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-16 04:31:18	En_Passant	I spent hours trying to complete Silver Lake remix
2016-01-16 04:31:21	@PikFan	like a good challenge kind of hard, or just a stupid kind of hard?
2016-01-16 04:31:25	@PikFan	oh wow
2016-01-16 04:31:36	En_Passant	Both, I'd say
2016-01-16 04:32:00	En_Passant	(of course, nothing less than a Platinum satisfies me)
2016-01-16 04:32:09	@PikFan	the hardest one for me was Beastly Caverns
2016-01-16 04:32:10	@PikFan	same here
2016-01-16 04:32:22	En_Passant	You need good routing to get everything
2016-01-16 04:32:25	@PikFan	took many tries to get Platinum on Beastly Caverns
2016-01-16 04:32:30	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-16 04:32:40	En_Passant	That's the real challenge. The fake challenge comes from dumb mistakes screwing you up
2016-01-16 04:32:54	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-01-16 04:33:08	@PikFan	I still haven't gotten all platinum medals on Battle Enemies
2016-01-16 04:33:20	@PikFan	and only a silver medal for the Plasm Wraith
2016-01-16 04:33:20	En_Passant	Yeah, Battle Enemies is worse for me too
2016-01-16 04:33:51	@PikFan	I think BE! is harder for everyone
2016-01-16 04:34:02	@PikFan	you can waste lots of time trying to harvest Pikmin
2016-01-16 04:34:03	En_Passant	I like the concept less, to be honest
2016-01-16 04:34:17	En_Passant	For that reason, everyone prefers growing Pikmin
2016-01-16 04:35:01	@PikFan	yeah, they prefer growing Pikmin, but it takes more time to grow the Pikmin than it does to defeat the enemies with a big army
2016-01-16 04:35:15	@PikFan	the problem is finding that balance
2016-01-16 04:35:20	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-01-16 04:35:21	@PikFan	in CT, it's simple
2016-01-16 04:35:27	@PikFan	gather the fruit as fast as you can
2016-01-16 04:35:34	En_Passant	with the Pikmin you have
2016-01-16 04:35:46	@PikFan	but in BE, you've gotta find the right balance between resources and speed
2016-01-16 04:35:53	@PikFan	that's harder
2016-01-16 04:36:16	En_Passant	Would you say it's better?
2016-01-16 04:36:24	@PikFan	BE?
2016-01-16 04:36:28	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-16 04:36:39	@PikFan	it's certainly harder
2016-01-16 04:36:45	@PikFan	I'm not sure if it's better, though
2016-01-16 04:37:03	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-16 04:37:21	@PikFan	I think I like creating traditional strategies like the ones in CT more
2016-01-16 04:37:59	En_Passant	I'm thinking about my own Mission Mode
2016-01-16 04:38:15	En_Passant	I have realized that my modes are "bring treasures back to base" and "bring corpses back to base"
2016-01-16 04:38:40	@PikFan	it's unoriginal, but that works
2016-01-16 04:38:49	@PikFan	why, do you want something more original?
2016-01-16 04:39:10	En_Passant	Well, they're essentially the same thing
2016-01-16 04:39:18	@PikFan	sure
2016-01-16 04:39:28	@PikFan	hmmm
2016-01-16 04:39:51	@PikFan	in Hyrule Warriors, there was a pretty big variety of missions
2016-01-16 04:40:15	@PikFan	the common ones were "capture such and such keeps" or "defeat such and such enemy captains"
2016-01-16 04:40:45	@PikFan	then there were more obscure ones like "protect the Bombchu" or "kill three enemies simultaneously"
2016-01-16 04:41:20	@PikFan	taking that concept of varied challenges and applying it to Pikmin would be interesting, I'd find
2016-01-16 04:41:30	@PikFan	Challenge Mode would actually become Challenge Mode
2016-01-16 04:42:14	@PikFan	for instance, you have a limited number of Pikmin
2016-01-16 04:42:20	@PikFan	and you have to kill a Red Bulborb
2016-01-16 04:42:32	@PikFan	but there could be different ways to kill it
2016-01-16 04:42:50	@PikFan	like... you can only attack the eyes, maybe
2016-01-16 04:43:02	@PikFan	that'd be a harder challenge, because it requires good aim
2016-01-16 04:43:28	En_Passant	That's not that hard, at least for me
2016-01-16 04:43:29	@PikFan	an easier one might be like defeat it in x amount of time
2016-01-16 04:43:45	En_Passant	But I see what you're saying
2016-01-16 04:44:10	En_Passant	That's actually a really good way of doing it
2016-01-16 04:44:18	@PikFan	another one could be trying to lure enemies to certain spots
2016-01-16 04:45:22	@PikFan	another one could be killing only certain enemies, like a guessing game
2016-01-16 04:45:26	@PikFan	and so on
2016-01-16 04:45:41	@PikFan	I dunno, just brainstorming
2016-01-16 04:46:45	En_Passant	Those could be my two modes
2016-01-16 04:47:01	En_Passant	A more traditional one where you collect enemies and/or treasures
2016-01-16 04:47:12	En_Passant	(in big maps)
2016-01-16 04:47:47	En_Passant	And one where there are smaller missions with more specific and varied objectives
2016-01-16 04:48:07	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-16 04:48:29	@PikFan	in Hyrule Warriors, there's actually missions where the goal is to collect as many Rupees as possibl
2016-01-16 04:48:32	@PikFan	*possible
2016-01-16 04:48:53	@PikFan	but you're racing the game to it
2016-01-16 04:49:03	@PikFan	...uh
2016-01-16 04:49:09	@PikFan	well, let me explain
2016-01-16 04:49:26	@PikFan	in HW, up to three factions can be on the battlefield, battling each other
2016-01-16 04:49:46	@PikFan	so one AI faction fights you and the other AI faction for Rupees
2016-01-16 04:50:06	@PikFan	the other AI faction is just there to give rupees when killed
2016-01-16 04:50:20	@PikFan	so you're in a race with the AI to get the most rupees
2016-01-16 04:50:33	@PikFan	sometimes it's kill the most enemies, or capture the most keeps
2016-01-16 04:53:00	@PikFan	woo, Splatfest starts in 7 minutes
2016-01-16 04:54:04	En_Passant	Splatfests last a day, right?
2016-01-16 04:54:19	@PikFan	yup, 24 hours
2016-01-16 04:54:40	@PikFan	so I FINALLY will get a break from overpowered Japanese players
2016-01-16 04:57:44	@PikFan	woah
2016-01-16 04:58:05	@PikFan	some Miiverse has a handwritten post that says "fuck the future"
2016-01-16 04:58:13	@PikFan	surprised Nintendo hasn't removed it
2016-01-16 04:59:56	En_Passant	Pretty sure they just use a filter
2016-01-16 05:00:23	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-16 05:00:30	@PikFan	well, it's in cursive, so...
2016-01-16 05:04:29	@PikFan	ugh, waiting is taking forever
2016-01-16 05:04:39	@PikFan	I've already got Team Future people with me
2016-01-16 05:04:47	@PikFan	but there aren't any Team Past people
2016-01-16 05:09:39	En_Passant	lol, cursive

2016-01-16 05:32:28	Neocraftz1553	maybe a light blue with a blue border will do
2016-01-16 05:32:40	Neocraftz1553	the light blue like my text

2016-01-16 12:49:57	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-16 12:50:32	@J	apparently it might snow in the next few days, but it hasn't yet
2016-01-16 12:50:36	@J	not that I noticed anyway
2016-01-16 12:51:10	@Espyo	here, the sun decided it's time to start shining radiantly
2016-01-16 12:51:26	@J	oh, that too
2016-01-16 12:51:26	@Espyo	honestly, Portugal's been so extreme in the past few weeks
2016-01-16 12:51:29	@J	it's sunny and cold
2016-01-16 12:51:35	@Espyo	either floods or intense sun
2016-01-16 12:51:45	@Espyo	oh, you guys got floods too at points

2016-01-16 13:05:16	ScruffyChat	Hey Yoshi2!
2016-01-16 13:05:27	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-16 13:05:41	ScruffyChat	As per people's request yesterday, I'm creating a fully realized edit of Pikmin
2016-01-16 13:05:45	ScruffyChat	Pikmin 2*
2016-01-16 13:06:14	ScruffyChat	Which is basically a "night mode" version of Pikmin 2 where enemies and constraints are more difficult
2016-01-16 13:06:53	ScruffyChat	I can already change lighting and what enemies appear where
2016-01-16 13:07:24	ScruffyChat	But I had some questions about reading szs files, I've been following your guide on how to extract and change them
2016-01-16 13:07:43	ScruffyChat	It might just be Mac issues, but it's not really working
2016-01-16 13:07:55	ScruffyChat	I got the SZS toolkit and installed it
2016-01-16 13:07:57	@Espyo	probably Mac issues
2016-01-16 13:08:18	ScruffyChat	And created "SZS Extract.bat" and "SZS Update.bat"
2016-01-16 13:08:31	@Espyo	oh, I would NEVER trust bat files to work outside of windows
2016-01-16 13:08:36	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-16 13:08:38	@Espyo	thing is, they already JUST BARELY work on windows
2016-01-16 13:08:47	@Espyo	outside? that's like asking for the pope to play basketball
2016-01-16 13:08:54	ScruffyChat	Haha
2016-01-16 13:08:55	@Espyo	the batch files don't do much
2016-01-16 13:09:08	@Espyo	they're just a simpler way to open the file with the extractor programs in the toolkit
2016-01-16 13:09:22	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-16 13:09:40	@Espyo	so if you can open the files anyway, the batch scripts won't do much
2016-01-16 13:09:43	@Espyo	except make it slightly easier
2016-01-16 13:09:47	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-16 13:10:07	ScruffyChat	Well then I just need to figure out using the toolkit
2016-01-16 13:10:25	ScruffyChat	Every time I open it, it appears to log me out and I can't type anything into it
2016-01-16 13:11:07	@Espyo	what
2016-01-16 13:11:12	@Espyo	log you out of your Mac session?
2016-01-16 13:12:13	ScruffyChat	No, but it logs me out of the... terminal
2016-01-16 13:12:21	ScruffyChat	Hold on, I can show you in a screenshot
2016-01-16 13:13:13	@Espyo	oh, the terminal
2016-01-16 13:13:20	@Espyo	sounds like a crash of sorts, to me
2016-01-16 13:13:28	@Espyo	does it ever print anything out into the terminal?
2016-01-16 13:13:59	ScruffyChat	It always prints:
2016-01-16 13:14:01	ScruffyChat	logging out
2016-01-16 13:14:12	ScruffyChat	Saving session...
2016-01-16 13:14:25	ScruffyChat	...copying shared history...
2016-01-16 13:14:50	ScruffyChat	...saving history...truncating history files...
2016-01-16 13:14:50	@Espyo	does this happen when you double click wszst? I'm assuming that's the tool you're using
2016-01-16 13:14:57	ScruffyChat	...completed.
2016-01-16 13:14:57	@Espyo	or do you open a terminal first, and then type "wszst"?
2016-01-16 13:14:59	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-16 13:15:06	ScruffyChat	I double click wsszst
2016-01-16 13:15:08	@Espyo	try the latter then
2016-01-16 13:15:29	@Espyo	at least on windows, when you open a program that opens a terminal window, if the program closes, the terminal dies with it
2016-01-16 13:15:37	@Espyo	and just double clicking will make the program end
2016-01-16 13:15:41	@Espyo	because wszst expects more information
2016-01-16 13:15:42	ScruffyChat	oh shoot, that worked
2016-01-16 13:15:49	@Espyo	and it print out more info, yeah?
2016-01-16 13:15:57	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-16 13:16:00	@Espyo	about how the usage is something like "wszst [operation] [file]" or whatever
2016-01-16 13:16:04	ScruffyChat	as in how to get wszst help
2016-01-16 13:16:07	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-01-16 13:16:08	@Espyo	ok, good
2016-01-16 13:16:10	@Espyo	now uh...
2016-01-16 13:16:19	@Espyo	this is where the batch files WOULD'VE come in handy
2016-01-16 13:16:25	@Espyo	because to extract a szs file, you need to type some extra info
2016-01-16 13:16:28	@Espyo	which isn't long
2016-01-16 13:16:32	@Espyo	but it's a pain to do it over and over
2016-01-16 13:16:37	ScruffyChat	I don't midn
2016-01-16 13:16:47	@Espyo	better than nothing, for sure
2016-01-16 13:17:31	ScruffyChat	Well, I still have the batch files, and running through Wine they have a chance of working
2016-01-16 13:17:35	@Espyo	wait, I don't think I created batch files for wszst
2016-01-16 13:17:42	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-01-16 13:17:59	@Espyo	for wszst, IIRC, you type "wszst extract [filename]"
2016-01-16 13:18:03	@Espyo	[filename] being the name of the szs file
2016-01-16 13:18:05	@Espyo	and it just does it
2016-01-16 13:18:28	ScruffyChat	do I have to write the whole directory to that filename, or just the filename itself
2016-01-16 13:18:51	@Espyo	when you call wszst, do you write the whole directory?
2016-01-16 13:18:58	ScruffyChat	no
2016-01-16 13:19:22	@Espyo	oh, so you just type "wszst" anywhere? that's nice
2016-01-16 13:19:26	@Espyo	wasn't expecting that to have worked
2016-01-16 13:19:36	@Espyo	ok, then you can do "cd" followed by the directory of where the szs files are
2016-01-16 13:19:39	@Espyo	and you operate on that folder
2016-01-16 13:19:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 13:19:43	@Espyo	and from there, you just type the name of the file
2016-01-16 13:19:46	@Espyo	no directory needed
2016-01-16 13:21:23	ScruffyChat	Woah! IT WORKED
2016-01-16 13:21:31	ScruffyChat	THAT DOESN'T USUALLY HAPPEN TO ME
2016-01-16 13:21:49	ScruffyChat	I extracted the enemy parameter file
2016-01-16 13:22:19	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-16 13:22:23	ScruffyChat	This is going to be fun
2016-01-16 13:22:25	@Espyo	and now you can make the changes and repack
2016-01-16 13:22:30	@Espyo	to repack... I forgot the command
2016-01-16 13:22:34	ScruffyChat	Right, so when I repack
2016-01-16 13:22:40	ScruffyChat	wouldn't it be wszst update?
2016-01-16 13:22:43	@Espyo	yeah, that!
2016-01-16 13:22:50	ScruffyChat	Yusss
2016-01-16 13:22:55	@Espyo	make the changes inside the folder, do wszst update, and the .szs file gets updated
2016-01-16 13:22:57	@Espyo	good to go
2016-01-16 13:23:03	@Espyo	...but how will you put it back inside the game?
2016-01-16 13:23:08	@Espyo	because there are several ways, and none of them good
2016-01-16 13:23:21	@Espyo	will you be using J's tool, GCEdit?
2016-01-16 13:23:50	ScruffyChat	When you update, do you say to update the szs file or the .d folder?
2016-01-16 13:24:40	@Espyo	the file
2016-01-16 13:24:48	@Espyo	it'll know that it's what inside the folder that couns
2016-01-16 13:24:49	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-16 13:24:50	@Espyo	*counts
2016-01-16 13:24:57	ScruffyChat	Ah, neat
2016-01-16 13:25:14	ScruffyChat	So then once the szs is updated, isn't already back in the game/
2016-01-16 13:25:16	ScruffyChat	?
2016-01-16 13:25:20	@Espyo	afraid not
2016-01-16 13:25:22	ScruffyChat	I haven't moved the szs file anywhere
2016-01-16 13:25:31	@Espyo	I mean, you did extract everything from inside the ISO somewhere, right?
2016-01-16 13:25:37	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-16 13:25:41	@Espyo	on Dolphin, do you run this extracted folder, or do you run the ISO?
2016-01-16 13:25:51	ScruffyChat	I run the extracted folder
2016-01-16 13:25:54	@Espyo	Dolphin apparently can run folders as games, but I never got that to work
2016-01-16 13:25:59	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-16 13:26:00	@Espyo	oh, lucky you then
2016-01-16 13:26:06	@Espyo	in that case, yeah, it's already done
2016-01-16 13:26:11	ScruffyChat	In my extracted folder is a file called boot.dol
2016-01-16 13:26:12	@Espyo	you don't need anything else other than update
2016-01-16 13:26:17	ScruffyChat	That runs the hacked version
2016-01-16 13:26:19	ScruffyChat	Yay!
2016-01-16 13:26:27	@Espyo	what's so special about that boot.dol?
2016-01-16 13:26:52	ScruffyChat	It has the Dolphin logo, and running it will cause Dolphin to run the extracted folder as the gae
2016-01-16 13:26:54	ScruffyChat	game*
2016-01-16 13:27:15	ScruffyChat	With a completely different save file and folder for textures
2016-01-16 13:27:35	@Espyo	what
2016-01-16 13:27:43	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right...
2016-01-16 13:27:54	@Espyo	for me, I have to go on Dolphin, go on File, Open (or Open something)
2016-01-16 13:27:57	@Espyo	and then pick the .dol
2016-01-16 13:28:00	@Espyo	I can't just double-click it
2016-01-16 13:28:10	@Espyo	anyway, it works, but it COMPLETELY butchers the save file and texture folder
2016-01-16 13:28:14	@Espyo	thing is, it gives this new game its own ID
2016-01-16 13:28:22	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 13:28:25	@Espyo	but it just stumbles over itself and confuses that ID with Pikmin 2's real ID
2016-01-16 13:28:39	@Espyo	so it considers my Pikmin 2 saves invalid, and ignores the saves on the new ID's folder
2016-01-16 13:28:46	@Espyo	although it creates the saves on the new ID's folder
2016-01-16 13:28:50	@Espyo	it's a weird mess of the sort
2016-01-16 13:28:53	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-16 13:28:58	ScruffyChat	That is odd
2016-01-16 13:29:01	@Espyo	so I just created my own Pikmin 2 ISO and use tools to extract from within and place back in
2016-01-16 13:29:06	@Espyo	it's a pain, but at least it works...
2016-01-16 13:29:09	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-16 13:29:15	@Espyo	hey, when you're tampering with the enemy parameters
2016-01-16 13:29:21	@Espyo	if you can find out what some previous unknown parameters are
2016-01-16 13:29:25	@Espyo	please add them to the wiki
2016-01-16 13:29:33	ScruffyChat	I'll try my darnedest
2016-01-16 13:29:36	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-01-16 13:29:39	ScruffyChat	But yeah, that is weird
2016-01-16 13:30:01	ScruffyChat	With this extracted folder, Dolphin treats it as a separate copy of Pikmin 2
2016-01-16 13:30:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 13:30:22	ScruffyChat	Even if I delete the folder and re-extract Pikmin 2's files, it still remembers my save data
2016-01-16 13:30:29	@Espyo	oh, and for me, that "own folder" thing only works with the USA version of Pikmin 2
2016-01-16 13:30:33	@Espyo	European version just crashes
2016-01-16 13:30:37	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2016-01-16 13:30:44	ScruffyChat	I'm using USA as well
2016-01-16 13:30:51	@Espyo	what a mess this entire thing is...
2016-01-16 13:30:55	@Espyo	but no matter
2016-01-16 13:31:03	ScruffyChat	Hehe you know it
2016-01-16 13:31:11	ScruffyChat	Oh, and one more question
2016-01-16 13:31:30	@Espyo	mhm?
2016-01-16 13:31:30	ScruffyChat	Is it possible that you can make savestates update to reflect changes to the files?
2016-01-16 13:31:41	Yoshi2	probably not
2016-01-16 13:31:47	ScruffyChat	When I make a savestate, it seems to remember only how the files were at that moment
2016-01-16 13:31:52	ScruffyChat	No matter what I change
2016-01-16 13:31:56	@Espyo	yeah, no
2016-01-16 13:32:00	@Espyo	the savestates save the RAM
2016-01-16 13:32:05	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-16 13:32:10	@Espyo	and if the game already loaded the enemy files into RAM at that point
2016-01-16 13:32:13	@Espyo	...that's how they'll get loaded
2016-01-16 13:32:24	ScruffyChat	Okay, no problem
2016-01-16 13:32:36	Yoshi2	and even if the files aren't loaded into RAM, quirky stuff happens
2016-01-16 13:32:36	ScruffyChat	It was mainly wondering if I could skip the intro whenever I boot the game
2016-01-16 13:32:45	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 13:32:55	@Espyo	yeah, it's a pain, but you can't
2016-01-16 13:33:03	ScruffyChat	It's no problem
2016-01-16 13:33:07	Yoshi2	it can work if you set the savestate right, but it can also crash eventually
2016-01-16 13:33:07	@Espyo	I think you can for area files
2016-01-16 13:33:12	@Espyo	those only get loaded on the area's loading screen
2016-01-16 13:33:23	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-16 13:33:43	ScruffyChat	Well, it's no big deal anyway, I'd rather see all changes and just bear out the extra time
2016-01-16 13:33:48	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 13:34:43	ScruffyChat	I'm so glad I have this wiki to help me as well, otherwise I would never figure out what all the internal names are
2016-01-16 13:34:57	@Espyo	yeah, that's why I was so eager to put them there
2016-01-16 13:35:00	@Espyo	won't help most users
2016-01-16 13:35:03	@Espyo	but it'll still help
2016-01-16 13:35:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2016-01-16 13:35:10	@Espyo	also why I decided to shove it inside a collapsible box
2016-01-16 13:35:16	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-16 13:35:31	@Espyo	it's kinda iffy, since having that there is ONLY useful for hackers
2016-01-16 13:35:47	@Espyo	so if Nintendo ever decides to get frisky, they'll have a good reason to tell us off on that
2016-01-16 13:37:08	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2016-01-16 13:37:16	ScruffyChat	Well thanks so much for your help!
2016-01-16 13:37:33	@Espyo	no worries!
2016-01-16 13:37:39	@Espyo	can't wait to see what you come up with
2016-01-16 13:38:10	ScruffyChat	thank you
2016-01-16 13:38:19	ScruffyChat	And I'll add any enemy info I find to the wiki
2016-01-16 13:39:14	@Espyo	ok, thanks
2016-01-16 13:39:30	@Espyo	oh, and if you find anything funny, like the height the Beady Long Legs' legs go
2016-01-16 13:39:32	@Espyo	make a gif out of it!
2016-01-16 13:39:33	@J	I've wanted to go back to GCEdit lately, get that Qt port done then add good stuff like transparent archives and editing files in-place
2016-01-16 13:39:46	@Espyo	yeah, you mentioned the archives
2016-01-16 13:39:47	@J	if people are doing stuff with GCN modding, that'll be good motivation
2016-01-16 13:40:02	@Espyo	honestly, all I was want is for the program to not crash if I drag the window
2016-01-16 13:40:08	@J	yeah, that's the Qt port
2016-01-16 13:40:11	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-16 13:40:28	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/I%20don%27t%20know.gif ah, here it is
2016-01-16 13:40:41	@J	oh, I remember that
2016-01-16 13:40:51	ScruffyChat	What a nightmare
2016-01-16 13:40:52	@J	beautiful
2016-01-16 13:41:11	ScruffyChat	It works so well
2016-01-16 13:41:16	@Espyo	it really does
2016-01-16 13:46:36	@J	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70348 apparently that crash was actually fixed
2016-01-16 13:46:56	@J	I still want to port to Qt, but I might be able to make a build that works
2016-01-16 13:47:44	@Espyo	if you have a few minutes, that'd be nice
2016-01-16 13:47:52	@J	I'll take a look today
2016-01-16 13:48:03	@Espyo	thanks
2016-01-16 13:53:22	@Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIcgmZItSaw ...from SCRATCH?
2016-01-16 13:57:28	@J	Miles is hiding secret things
2016-01-16 14:01:43	@Espyo	very secret
2016-01-16 14:04:31	ScruffyChat	Okay, discovered one thing
2016-01-16 14:04:38	Yoshi2	I really want so see battalion wars modding be a bit more popular, this seems like it has some potential
2016-01-16 14:06:11	ScruffyChat	{fp27}, which we previously called Unknown (Max HP?)
2016-01-16 14:06:28	ScruffyChat	Is actually the height above the enemy at which its health wheel appears
2016-01-16 14:06:51	ScruffyChat	By above the enemy I mean above its local center
2016-01-16 14:07:03	@Espyo	oh!
2016-01-16 14:07:06	ScruffyChat	For example with a Red Bulborb that's a point right between its feet
2016-01-16 14:07:07	@Espyo	that makes so much sense
2016-01-16 14:07:12	@Espyo	I had to struggle a tiny bit with that on the engine, too
2016-01-16 14:07:16	@Espyo	so it makes total sense that it's a parameter
2016-01-16 14:07:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 14:07:46	@Espyo	that one should be on {{p2 enemy technical}}
2016-01-16 14:07:46	Testyo	"p2_enemy_technical" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:p2_enemy_technical
2016-01-16 14:07:51	@Espyo	since it's global to all of them
2016-01-16 14:08:01	@Espyo	let me check the Japanese comment one more time, then...
2016-01-16 14:08:22	@Espyo	"life of height"
2016-01-16 14:08:24	@Espyo	...checks out
2016-01-16 14:08:33	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-16 14:08:39	ScruffyChat	Okay, I'll add it
2016-01-16 14:08:48	@Espyo	oh, google translate can't understand that "X of Y" in Japan means "Y of X" in English
2016-01-16 14:08:52	@Espyo	so yeah, height of life
2016-01-16 14:09:39	ScruffyChat	Huh
2016-01-16 14:09:47	ScruffyChat	I got "height of life"
2016-01-16 14:10:05	@Espyo	...
2016-01-16 14:10:10	ScruffyChat	After that is life recovery rate
2016-01-16 14:10:21	@Espyo	"after that"?
2016-01-16 14:10:30	ScruffyChat	{fp31}
2016-01-16 14:10:40	@Espyo	ah, that one is known, yes
2016-01-16 14:10:42	ScruffyChat	which checks out on our template
2016-01-16 14:10:55	ScruffyChat	but then {fp30} we don't have a clue
2016-01-16 14:11:03	ScruffyChat	Google Translate says "vigilance life"
2016-01-16 14:11:37	ScruffyChat	To test these I either multiply by ten or turn to zero
2016-01-16 14:11:41	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-16 14:12:00	ScruffyChat	I fought, (and lost to) a Red Bulborb with 7500 HP just now
2016-01-16 14:12:06	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-16 14:13:05	ScruffyChat	So let's see what vigilance life is
2016-01-16 14:19:21	Yoshi2	maybe that is the time for how long a monster is on watch-out?
2016-01-16 14:19:32	ScruffyChat	that might be it
2016-01-16 14:19:52	@Espyo	watch-out?
2016-01-16 14:20:13	ScruffyChat	So far, I've set a Bulborb's from 30 to 300, and it wouldn't go back to its base for while, it would keep turning around and making another run at me
2016-01-16 14:20:18	ScruffyChat	But I'm not done testing yet
2016-01-16 14:20:24	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-01-16 14:22:56	Yoshi2	Espyo: I have an addon installed that shows me the meaning of japanese characters, and other meanings for 警戒 (the first 2 characters) seem to be alertness, precaution, lookout, watch
2016-01-16 14:23:51	ScruffyChat	Yes, I've set it to 30000
2016-01-16 14:24:02	Yoshi2	on the other hand,fp29 has the same two first characters
2016-01-16 14:24:05	ScruffyChat	And the Red Bulborb keeps turning around even if you're out of range
2016-01-16 14:24:17	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Pikmin fangame engine by Espyo (+135 /* Download */ ) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_fangame_engine&curid=10215&diff=51552&oldid=51515
2016-01-16 14:24:24	ScruffyChat	Eventually far enough away it will turn around, cautiously like a Fiery Bulblax does
2016-01-16 14:24:26	Yoshi2	I think fp29 covers the time aspect
2016-01-16 14:24:31	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-16 14:24:42	Yoshi2	maybe fp30 means if the monster drops below X health, it will be on lookout?
2016-01-16 14:24:49	ScruffyChat	But if you so much as step back in this increased range, the Bulborb will notice from any distance
2016-01-16 14:24:56	ScruffyChat	I haven't hurt it at all
2016-01-16 14:24:59	@Espyo	that's such a specific behavior... I never noticed it in any enemy
2016-01-16 14:26:48	ScruffyChat	It might be the maximum amount of time that a Bulborb can care about Pikmin out of rang
2016-01-16 14:27:52	@Espyo	so weird that they'd make it work like that
2016-01-16 14:28:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 14:28:42	ScruffyChat	I don't get it
2016-01-16 14:28:52	ScruffyChat	This Bulborb isn't letting up though
2016-01-16 14:28:59	ScruffyChat	Even though it can't reach me
2016-01-16 14:29:04	ScruffyChat	It just keeps coming back
2016-01-16 14:29:28	ScruffyChat	It definitely changes something about its alertness while retreating to its nest
2016-01-16 14:38:30	ScruffyChat	Okay, and at zero, It's behaving strangely as well
2016-01-16 14:38:45	ScruffyChat	If I wake up the Bulborb from behind, it won't even notice me
2016-01-16 14:38:52	ScruffyChat	It has a FOV of 90
2016-01-16 14:38:58	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-16 14:39:41	ScruffyChat	And even if I follow it while it's walking back, it doesn't notice unless I'm right next to it at the time it goes back to sleep
2016-01-16 14:40:47	ScruffyChat	I can see that it starts to turn around when it looks around, but then it roars and goes back to sleep

2016-01-16 15:00:42	ScruffyChat	Thanks!
2016-01-16 15:01:36	ScruffyChat	Now I'm testing something specific to adult Bulborbs, {fp01} foot range
2016-01-16 15:01:43	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as Chiaki_Nanamia
2016-01-16 15:02:08	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-01-16 15:04:43	ScruffyChat	Hahahahaha
2016-01-16 15:04:54	ScruffyChat	Foot range is how much the Bulborb can rotate with each step
2016-01-16 15:05:34	ScruffyChat	When it has to turn around
2016-01-16 15:05:57	ScruffyChat	30 is what it had, at 300 it takes its sweet time
2016-01-16 15:14:16	ScruffyChat	So yeah, {fp01} for Bulborbs is how much they can rotate in place with each step
2016-01-16 15:14:36	ScruffyChat	Although it seems to behave inversely to how high the number is
2016-01-16 15:21:40	ScruffyChat	I know exactly what {fp04} is
2016-01-16 15:21:50	ScruffyChat	It is damage scale time
2016-01-16 15:22:09	ScruffyChat	More specifically, how long it takes for an enemy to distort when receiving damage
2016-01-16 15:22:36	ScruffyChat	I changed it from 0.35 to 1.35, and enemies took much longer to distort like they normally do
2016-01-16 15:28:36	@Espyo	oh, makes sense
2016-01-16 15:32:04	ScruffyChat	Do you know if any pararmeters might be protected in any way, or require editing more than one file?
2016-01-16 15:32:12	@J	why does my Windows 7 VM use 80% of the disk space and 65% of the memory without anything installed or anything running?
2016-01-16 15:32:23	ScruffyChat	i've tried editing the paper bag in the valley of repose but nothing changes

2016-01-16 15:42:36	@J	I've heard that and I don't really believe it
2016-01-16 15:42:47	Yoshi2	well
2016-01-16 15:42:51	@J	when the meter reaches the top, bad things happen
2016-01-16 15:43:02	@J	and it goes up when you open programs
2016-01-16 15:43:58	@Espyo	https://youtu.be/Y70u2vkpKbw ok, this is pretty mental
2016-01-16 15:44:16	@Espyo	(starts at 5:30)

2016-01-16 15:56:53	Pikminfan27	Hi!
2016-01-16 15:57:34	@J	wow
2016-01-16 15:57:50	@J	I'm just asking about how the game normally works (I haven't played it)
2016-01-16 15:58:44	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-16 15:58:48	@Espyo	guess what: swimming makes you swim
2016-01-16 15:58:51	@Espyo	it doesn't make you go nuts
2016-01-16 15:58:59	@Espyo	you aren't meant to swim between islands
2016-01-16 15:59:07	@Espyo	Link is meant to drown long before he makes any progress
2016-01-16 15:59:10	@Espyo	you're meant to go there by boat
2016-01-16 15:59:15	@Espyo	which you get like 1 hour into the game
2016-01-16 15:59:17	@J	oh, you drown just by swimming on the surface?
2016-01-16 15:59:22	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-16 15:59:24	@J	huh, never seen that before
2016-01-16 15:59:34	@Espyo	yeah, precisely to make sure you don't go overboard
2016-01-16 15:59:39	@Espyo	so it's more like a fatigue meter
2016-01-16 15:59:53	ScruffyChat	What does TAS stand for/
2016-01-16 16:01:17	@Espyo	oh boy
2016-01-16 16:01:23	@Espyo	a TAS is a tool-assisted speedrun
2016-01-16 16:01:27	@Espyo	or superplay
2016-01-16 16:01:27	ScruffyChat	Oh right
2016-01-16 16:01:29	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2016-01-16 16:01:38	ScruffyChat	I know the meaning, I just forgot the acronym
2016-01-16 16:01:40	@Espyo	you play the game, but use tools like savestates and slowdown to undo mistakes and play with perfect reflexes
2016-01-16 16:01:42	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-16 16:02:06	@Espyo	it used to be tool-assisted speedrun, but people have been doing a lot of fun runs that don't necessarily involve speed, but more like entertainment
2016-01-16 16:02:16	@Espyo	so calling it a tool-assisted superplay is more "canon" now
2016-01-16 16:04:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 16:07:08	Yoshi2	I'm suprised the runner hasn't found a way to just skip right to the end of the game
2016-01-16 16:07:15	Yoshi2	seems very crazy
2016-01-16 16:07:38	@Espyo	give it time
2016-01-16 16:07:44	@Espyo	we've got wrong warping in Ocarina of Time
2016-01-16 16:07:49	@Espyo	going through walls in A Link to the Past
2016-01-16 16:08:50	ScruffyChat	Aww man
2016-01-16 16:09:08	ScruffyChat	{fp09} and {fp10} are definitely territory and home radius, respectively
2016-01-16 16:09:14	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-16 16:09:18	@Espyo	...wait, what's the difference?
2016-01-16 16:09:35	ScruffyChat	{fp09} is territory, the distance a Red Bulborb will follow you
2016-01-16 16:09:56	ScruffyChat	{fp10} is home radius, the area in its territory in which it says time for bed
2016-01-16 16:10:16	@Espyo	ah, thought so
2016-01-16 16:10:20	ScruffyChat	Setting them both up means a Red Bulborb will follow you farther, and travel back less distance to fall asleep
2016-01-16 16:10:21	@Espyo	terrific!
2016-01-16 16:10:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2016-01-16 16:10:43	@Espyo	so many little intricacies
2016-01-16 16:10:50	@Espyo	makes me wonder about my own decisions on the engine
2016-01-16 16:13:06	Pikminfan27	What if you make it so the distance it follows you is smaller than the distance for where it falls asleep?
2016-01-16 16:13:16	Pikminfan27	Does the game crash?
2016-01-16 16:13:57	Pikminfan27	Or does something else happen?
2016-01-16 16:14:06	ScruffyChat	I have yet to test that
2016-01-16 16:14:17	ScruffyChat	For now I've led it into the landing site
2016-01-16 16:14:55	ScruffyChat	It seems that it can not cross the paper bags, no matter how hard it tries
2016-01-16 16:15:33	Pikminfan27	So, you're in the Valley of Repose?
2016-01-16 16:15:37	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-16 16:16:34	ScruffyChat	I had no idea that on day 3, 2 five posies and 3 one posies grow where the Red Onion wa
2016-01-16 16:16:37	ScruffyChat	was*
2016-01-16 16:17:29	ScruffyChat	Wait, I did set home radius larger than territory
2016-01-16 16:17:53	Pikminfan27	What happened, then?
2016-01-16 16:17:54	ScruffyChat	No crash, it's just that, /whenever/ the Red Bulborb senses no more Pikmin, it falls back asleep on the sopt
2016-01-16 16:18:39	Pikminfan27	That makes more sense than a game crash.
2016-01-16 16:19:52	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-16 16:20:07	ScruffyChat	I wonder if the home radius is zero, if it just stays awake
2016-01-16 16:20:27	@Espyo	might try to walk towards the home point, reach it, but not trigger the event to fall asleep
2016-01-16 16:20:33	@Espyo	so it turns around to try to go to the point again
2016-01-16 16:20:35	@Espyo	and keeps repeating
2016-01-16 16:20:39	@Espyo	just circles the home spot
2016-01-16 16:20:58	Pikminfan27	That would look really weird.
2016-01-16 16:21:03	Pikminfan27	But funny.
2016-01-16 16:21:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 16:23:38	Pikminfan27	And if it stays awake, it's basically an easy Bulbear!

2016-01-16 16:30:35	ScruffyChat	Dolphin emulation of the Gamecube version
2016-01-16 16:31:15	ScruffyChat	USA
2016-01-16 16:31:20	ScruffyChat	is the region
2016-01-16 16:33:06	Pikminfan27	I have a Dolphin Emulator of the Gamecube version, as well! For some reason, I got the PAL version. I wanted the USA one, because I live in the USA (Not too specific, is it?), and I'm hoping to buy the Wii version.
2016-01-16 16:34:24	ScruffyChat	That's odd
2016-01-16 16:34:47	Pikminfan27	I guess I got the wrong ISO.
2016-01-16 16:34:56	@Espyo	to update GitExtensions, the installer had to kill explorer.exe, and try to take it back
2016-01-16 16:35:09	@Espyo	it's ridiculous that it need to tell windows to go away to install something
2016-01-16 16:35:11	@Espyo	explorer is such a hog

2016-01-16 16:43:19	ScruffyChat	I'm thinking that might be the distance you have to run before a Bulborb no longer notices you in its radius
2016-01-16 16:43:26	@Espyo	uhm, maybe it's what I call "near radius" on the engine
2016-01-16 16:43:31	ScruffyChat	For example if it's trying to chase you through a weall
2016-01-16 16:43:33	ScruffyChat	wall*
2016-01-16 16:43:36	@Espyo	meaning that if a Pikmin is within this distance, it means it's chewing time
2016-01-16 16:43:43	Raymoo	Maybe it's even collision radius?

2016-01-16 16:54:14	Raymoo	I've not been in a wiki chat. Ever. I have plenty of time on many others, but here I am. It's good to be here.
2016-01-16 16:54:30	@Espyo	good to have you here
2016-01-16 16:54:39	ScruffyChat	yeah! welcome
2016-01-16 16:54:58	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 16:55:12	ScruffyChat	Now, private radius is the radius in which the Red Bulborb can still sense you while it's heading back to its home
2016-01-16 16:55:24	@Espyo	OH
2016-01-16 16:55:28	@Espyo	THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
2016-01-16 16:55:31	ScruffyChat	And, you know, stop in its tracks and turn around
2016-01-16 16:55:32	@Espyo	I was struggling with that on the engine
2016-01-16 16:55:46	Raymoo	oH
2016-01-16 16:55:49	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-01-16 16:55:52	Raymoo	That makes a lot of sense.
2016-01-16 16:55:54	@Espyo	I've just made it so that when an enemy is returning to its home, it enters a state where it IGNORES any pray
2016-01-16 16:56:07	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 16:56:12	Raymoo	So you can literally flood it with an entire squad and nothing'll happen
2016-01-16 16:56:16	Raymoo	Even if you start attacking it?
2016-01-16 16:56:16	@Espyo	otherwise it'd just go back-and-forth between looking at the pray, turning around, chasing it too far away from home, turning around, noticing the pray, turning around, etc.
2016-01-16 16:56:18	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-01-16 16:56:27	@Espyo	well, I couldn't have that
2016-01-16 16:56:38	@Espyo	so I made it still react to getting hurt by shaking Pikmin off, and attempting to chase them again then
2016-01-16 16:56:43	@Espyo	but that "private radius" makes more sense
2016-01-16 16:56:49	@Espyo	I'll have to think about implementing it in the future
2016-01-16 16:57:01	Raymoo	I can at least understand some of this, but very little
2016-01-16 16:57:13	Raymoo	The most editing experience I've had in a while was whaling away on a guided missile mod for Space Engineers
2016-01-16 16:57:25	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-16 16:57:39	@J	why not, if it's returning to home, make the detection radius be from its home, rather than from itself
2016-01-16 16:57:43	@J	if that makes sense
2016-01-16 16:58:00	Neocraftz1553	hello J
2016-01-16 16:58:02	@J	hi
2016-01-16 16:58:09	Raymoo	I don't know what these stars mean, but they're very starry
2016-01-16 16:58:15	Raymoo	Hi, J
2016-01-16 16:58:18	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 16:58:29	@Espyo	it makes sense
2016-01-16 16:58:32	@Espyo	in that I understand what you mean
2016-01-16 16:58:37	@Espyo	probably doesn't make much more sense other than that
2016-01-16 16:58:55	Neocraftz1553	that means they're currently on the moon or some other planet, raymoo :P
2016-01-16 16:58:58	@Espyo	it'd almost be the same as "ignore Pikmin for 5 seconds when attempting to come back home"
2016-01-16 16:59:05	@Espyo	yeah, there are several ways to approach this
2016-01-16 16:59:09	Raymoo	well there's that
2016-01-16 16:59:13	@Espyo	but honestly, I need to start focusing on everything else that's missing with the engine
2016-01-16 16:59:18	@Espyo	specially the basics, like water, menus, etc.
2016-01-16 16:59:27	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-01-16 16:59:28	Raymoo	i used to be the greatest sysop in all the land, then i left for three years
2016-01-16 16:59:40	Raymoo	Wait, are you building an engine or working on one?
2016-01-16 16:59:49	Neocraftz1553	he made one
2016-01-16 17:00:03	Raymoo	oh my
2016-01-16 17:00:04	Raymoo	goodness
2016-01-16 17:00:04	Neocraftz1553	hes currently working out an update for it
2016-01-16 17:00:28	Raymoo	i bow to such a great, powerful programmer, in respect of his admirable skill
2016-01-16 17:00:33	Raymoo	-bow goes here-
2016-01-16 17:00:37	@Espyo	hehe, thanks
2016-01-16 17:00:40	@Espyo	haven't you tried it out yet?
2016-01-16 17:00:46	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_fangame_engine#Download
2016-01-16 17:00:47	@Espyo	there are versions for download out now
2016-01-16 17:00:52	@Espyo	that ^
2016-01-16 17:01:01	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 17:01:04	Pikminfan27	He plays SSB4, not much Pikmin.
2016-01-16 17:01:19	Raymoo	I remember one guy made a WebGL renderer, game engine, and a load of models all in 200kb of JavaScript, and he's right
2016-01-16 17:01:26	Raymoo	I came because he was here, but I think I'll stay a while
2016-01-16 17:02:30	Raymoo	AAA titles in a nutshell
2016-01-16 17:02:40	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 17:02:40	Raymoo	"awl gwaet gaems us cee lalalala"
2016-01-16 17:03:01	Raymoo	I'm going to look through the source and see how dumbfounded I can get
2016-01-16 17:03:27	Pikminfan27	I don't have the fangame engine yet. I suppose I'll wait for a few updates.
2016-01-16 17:03:42	Yoshi2	if you do a lot of stuff in code instead of using media files, you can lower the file size quite a bit
2016-01-16 17:03:43	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-01-16 17:03:47	@Espyo	yeah ^
2016-01-16 17:04:09	Raymoo	In procedurally generating graphics and such?
2016-01-16 17:04:21	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 17:04:39	Raymoo	Cub did that, the WebGL experiment, managed to pack a whole little game into 200kb, and it has good graphics
2016-01-16 17:04:39	Neocraftz1553	hello yoshi2
2016-01-16 17:04:57	Neocraftz1553	 200kb?
2016-01-16 17:05:01	Raymoo	Yep!
2016-01-16 17:05:15	Neocraftz1553	I read ut as 200mb at first :P
2016-01-16 17:05:27	Neocraftz1553	woah
2016-01-16 17:05:28	Raymoo	It isn't that full featured, it's just a little space game where you can shoot randomly generated ships and fly into space stations with signs on them.
2016-01-16 17:05:43	Raymoo	Even the textures are random, and the geometry too!
2016-01-16 17:06:02	@Espyo	I think there was this one project one time
2016-01-16 17:06:07	@Espyo	a first-person shooter similar to Quake
2016-01-16 17:06:12	@Espyo	and it was only like 2 MB
2016-01-16 17:06:17	@J	it just goes to show how much stuff is built into browsers these days
2016-01-16 17:06:28	@Espyo	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger well that was easy
2016-01-16 17:06:34	Raymoo	Soon we'll have web servers full of games and eh
2016-01-16 17:06:37	@Espyo	 96KB
2016-01-16 17:06:41	@J	and also how small a few thousand lines of code really is
2016-01-16 17:06:50	@Espyo	just from the screenshot, you look at that, and go like "yeah, there's no way that's 96KB"
2016-01-16 17:07:01	@Espyo	yeah, that's true
2016-01-16 17:07:02	Raymoo	Well, good compression and a tiny decompression engine can shrink code a lot
2016-01-16 17:07:07	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-16 17:07:24	Raymoo	Plus, if you can use libraries, you can get most of the code to fit into outside libs
2016-01-16 17:07:47	Raymoo	Ooh, I see, the game's procedurally generated
2016-01-16 17:07:48	Raymoo	Explains a lot
2016-01-16 17:08:22	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 17:08:24	@Espyo	still impressive
2016-01-16 17:08:30	Raymoo	I could store a few hundred thousand copies of this on a little flash stick
2016-01-16 17:08:51	Raymoo	It's very impressive, especially how they managed to pack such graphics into a procedurally generated game
2016-01-16 17:09:24	Raymoo	BootChess is 487 bytes and probably machine code
2016-01-16 17:10:18	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-16 17:10:22	Raymoo	PK27 has to go eat
2016-01-16 17:10:33	@Espyo	oh, all righty
2016-01-16 17:12:53	Neocraftz1553	the activity has died down somewhat
2016-01-16 17:13:08	Neocraftz1553	It'll pick back up later though
2016-01-16 17:13:46	@J	[16:49:46] Raymoo say it to my face, you're right here
2016-01-16 17:13:51	@J	this makes somewhat more sense now
2016-01-16 17:13:59	Raymoo	He's right here
2016-01-16 17:14:03	Raymoo	Or was, he's eating now
2016-01-16 17:14:05	Neocraftz1553	heh yeah
2016-01-16 17:14:11	@J	it just clicked
2016-01-16 17:14:53	Raymoo	I just realized there's a DR name in this chat
2016-01-16 17:15:13	Neocraftz1553	DR?
2016-01-16 17:15:28	Raymoo	Danganronpa
2016-01-16 17:15:33	Raymoo	Chiaki Nanami is from DR2

2016-01-16 17:18:19	@Espyo	this is IRC, yeah
2016-01-16 17:18:26	Raymoo	I tried to set up an IRC server
2016-01-16 17:18:29	Raymoo	I failed miserably

2016-01-16 17:20:04	Yoshi2	not much point in setting up your IRC sercer unless you really want to do it
2016-01-16 17:20:06	Raymoo	Have fun
2016-01-16 17:21:52	Neocraftz1553

2016-01-16 17:22:44	Raymoo	ti's very white
2016-01-16 17:23:08	Neocraftz1553	highlight it
2016-01-16 17:23:15	@Espyo	yeah, setting up an IRC bot is much easier
2016-01-16 17:23:17	@Espyo	just stick with that
2016-01-16 17:23:19	Neocraftz1553	it makes it easier to see
2016-01-16 17:23:21	@Espyo	isn't that right, Testyo?
2016-01-16 17:23:23	Testyo	I just didn't want them to do that part fine for me, with source URL 'http://splatoon.wikia.com', source namespace 6, start file and number of files left as default
2016-01-16 17:23:48	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-16 17:23:57	Raymoo	Huh

2016-01-16 17:33:11	Yoshi2	gotta love how testyo doesn't care about physical limits
2016-01-16 17:33:12	Testyo	Who wants to the separation makes sense
2016-01-16 17:33:14	Raymoo	Right, um

2016-01-16 17:33:37	ScruffyChat	I have no ideas about these next two parameters
2016-01-16 17:33:38	Chiaki_Nanami	do you have a least favourite
2016-01-16 17:33:41	Neocraftz1553	 2 + 2

2016-01-16 17:34:37	Raymoo	least favorite is
2016-01-16 17:34:38	Testyo	in other news, I'm trying to do the Quaggled Mireclops with no wonder I confused you — this isn't what I was envisioning
2016-01-16 17:34:40	Raymoo	the janitor

2016-01-16 17:34:56	Chiaki_Nanami	wait who is that now again
2016-01-16 17:35:02	Neocraftz1553	woah
2016-01-16 17:35:07	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: which?
2016-01-16 17:35:15	Raymoo	I don't really have a most or least, because the most experience I have with the series is shoving Rin the nanite swarm into it
2016-01-16 17:35:16	ScruffyChat	Here's Google Translate's take
2016-01-16 17:35:22	ScruffyChat	{Fp01} 4 40.000000 # per the map
2016-01-16 17:35:30	ScruffyChat	{Fp33} selection per polygon with 4 50.000000 # map
2016-01-16 17:35:44	@Espyo	yeah... those probably involve map measurements and algorithms
2016-01-16 17:35:44	Raymoo	UV mapping?
2016-01-16 17:35:45	ScruffyChat	and also {Fp34} per 4 30.000000 # Pikmin
2016-01-16 17:35:49	@Espyo	...maybe?
2016-01-16 17:35:54	@Espyo	that's not a bad guess
2016-01-16 17:35:55	ScruffyChat	Could be
2016-01-16 17:36:05	@Espyo	but it's weird that it'd be a parameter
2016-01-16 17:36:05	Raymoo	All the DR experience I have is RPing in the universe, not as a character
2016-01-16 17:36:09	ScruffyChat	the 4 in front doesn't matter, I think
2016-01-16 17:36:17	Neocraftz1553	-900C
2016-01-16 17:36:18	Testyo	-900 C = -1588 °F / -626.85 K
2016-01-16 17:36:32	Pikminfan27	I want to know
2016-01-16 17:36:34	Neocraftz1553	-0000C
2016-01-16 17:36:34	Testyo	-0000 C = 32 °F / 273.15 K
2016-01-16 17:36:42	Pikminfan27	How's the Pikmin 2 editing?
2016-01-16 17:36:51	ScruffyChat	It might have something to do with the polygons in the area map and how it uses those?
2016-01-16 17:36:57	ScruffyChat	I'll try changing them
2016-01-16 17:37:05	Neocraftz1553	+00C
2016-01-16 17:37:06	Testyo	00 C = 32 °F / 273.15 K
2016-01-16 17:37:06	Raymoo	brb, i made a weird ham thing and now i'm going to feed on it
2016-01-16 17:37:11	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 17:37:18	Chiaki_Nanami	pikminfan27
2016-01-16 17:37:30	Chiaki_Nanami	your text colour is making your messages really difficult to read

2016-01-16 18:00:18	Pikminfan27	HUH?
2016-01-16 18:00:24	Chiaki_Nanami	it's not a wise move to ignore Operators though

2016-01-16 18:00:42	Neocraftz1553	yeah, not very wise
2016-01-16 18:01:03	Neocraftz1553	they could be warning you, and you wouldnt even know it

2016-01-16 18:02:22	Neocraftz1553	there, a full story by Testyo
2016-01-16 18:02:23	Testyo	I know we went over this already but it seems weird that helps yoshi2
2016-01-16 18:02:38	Pikminfan27	Testyo
2016-01-16 18:02:39	Testyo	Hello! I was dropping by to see if any of you guys have been able to find the pikmin short films that Shigeru Miyamoto made recently?
2016-01-16 18:02:45	Pikminfan27	Testyo
2016-01-16 18:02:46	Testyo	it helpts that the UI seems to be taken straight from one of the same thing, over and over?
2016-01-16 18:02:53	Pikminfan27	brb again...
2016-01-16 18:02:59	Neocraftz1553	heheh

2016-01-16 18:03:18	Testyo	where'd that can fly and grabs my pikmin if I don't throw lots of pikmin at him to bring him down to earth
2016-01-16 18:04:30	Neocraftz1553	Testyo, give me a link
2016-01-16 18:04:31	Testyo	Everyone, I just uploaded my first arrangement of the Pikmin soundtracks. I'm about to put the BMS stuff is now officially up \o/
2016-01-16 18:04:46	ScruffyChat	Hey, I said that!
2016-01-16 18:04:49	ScruffyChat	Or, part of it
2016-01-16 18:04:52	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-16 18:04:56	Neocraftz1553	I know
2016-01-16 18:05:16	Pikminfan27	How's the Pikmin 2 editing?
2016-01-16 18:05:20	Neocraftz1553	thats why it made me laugh
2016-01-16 18:05:32	Neocraftz1553	Testyo, pretend your scruffy
2016-01-16 18:05:33	Testyo	Purples can edit anything, really, but the training mode stage names are the easiest to figure out if they're working
2016-01-16 18:05:44	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 18:05:52	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-01-16 18:05:53	Testyo	that can be std::max using algorithm?
2016-01-16 18:06:03	ScruffyChat	Okay, {fp01} is really scary so far
2016-01-16 18:06:08	Neocraftz1553	didn't Espyo say something like that
2016-01-16 18:06:27	Pikminfan27	what is it {fp01}?
2016-01-16 18:06:32	ScruffyChat	It's normally at 40 for Red Bulborbs
2016-01-16 18:06:37	ScruffyChat	I don't know what it is yet
2016-01-16 18:06:44	Neocraftz1553	frames?
2016-01-16 18:06:48	Neocraftz1553	uh...
2016-01-16 18:07:16	Neocraftz1553	Testyo, whats your guess
2016-01-16 18:07:19	Testyo	but in the case of Pikmin 2, it's blue,l noticed.
2016-01-16 18:07:20	ScruffyChat	But set at 4000, touching the bulborb will immediately move it way up where I can't reach it
2016-01-16 18:07:29	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 18:07:32	ScruffyChat	and will treat midair as the ground
2016-01-16 18:07:39	Pikminfan27	well.
2016-01-16 18:08:00	Neocraftz1553	Testyos guess is:
2016-01-16 18:08:01	ScruffyChat	Set to 400, it will follow me as normal, but when it gets to the edge of its territory it disappeared
2016-01-16 18:08:05	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-01-16 18:08:10	Testyo	No more than I was making that up, but no
2016-01-16 18:08:27	Neocraftz1553	then... it seems to do a range of things
2016-01-16 18:08:56	ScruffyChat	It's only one number, so it's only controlling one parameter
2016-01-16 18:09:04	Neocraftz1553	maybe its almost like what "defines the charactoristics of an enemy
2016-01-16 18:09:07	ScruffyChat	But that parameter might have something to do with other
2016-01-16 18:09:07	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-16 18:09:12	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 18:09:12	ScruffyChat	others*
2016-01-16 18:09:20	Neocraftz1553	like a chain reaction... kinda
2016-01-16 18:11:02	ScruffyChat	Aha
2016-01-16 18:11:03	@Espyo	eo
2016-01-16 18:11:06	@Espyo	...*wow
2016-01-16 18:11:10	@Espyo	nice typo, Espyo
2016-01-16 18:11:26	ScruffyChat	With {fp01} set to zero, the Red Bulborb falls through the floor
2016-01-16 18:11:48	@Espyo	it's definitely something height-related, then
2016-01-16 18:11:50	ScruffyChat	And gives a pellet as normal
2016-01-16 18:11:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 18:12:06	@Espyo	oh, is it related to walls?
2016-01-16 18:12:18	@Espyo	wait, I was reading sp01
2016-01-16 18:12:19	ScruffyChat	It hasn't run into any walls yet
2016-01-16 18:12:33	@Espyo	what's google translate say?
2016-01-16 18:12:51	ScruffyChat	it calls {fp01} "per the map"
2016-01-16 18:13:05	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-01-16 18:13:06	ScruffyChat	So it's something to do with how the Bulborb reacts to the map
2016-01-16 18:13:11	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 18:13:22	Neocraftz1553	have you checked other bulborbs?
2016-01-16 18:13:41	Neocraftz1553	In other maps
2016-01-16 18:13:58	ScruffyChat	Look all I have is Valley of Repose on Day 3 for now
2016-01-16 18:14:05	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 18:15:09	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-01-16 18:15:40	ScruffyChat	Hm, 20 seems to be no different from 40
2016-01-16 18:15:43	Neocraftz1553	so, you can't play normally?
2016-01-16 18:15:59	ScruffyChat	I can, but I can't access that play with the hacked version
2016-01-16 18:16:08	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-01-16 18:16:27	Neocraftz1553	try 25
2016-01-16 18:16:33	ScruffyChat	100 first
2016-01-16 18:16:44	Pikminfan27	or 10,000
2016-01-16 18:16:46	Neocraftz1553	and then try 23
2016-01-16 18:16:48	ScruffyChat	on moment
2016-01-16 18:16:51	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 18:17:45	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-01-16 18:17:46	Testyo	it'd be easier to finish the next 20 tries doing stupid mistakes
2016-01-16 18:17:58	@Espyo	oh, right, it's the "per the map" thing

2016-01-16 18:26:10	Neocraftz1553	Espyo, you gotta make another vid like that
2016-01-16 18:26:12	Raymoo	and the bULBORB
2016-01-16 18:26:38	Neocraftz1553	sorry for requesting, but the video was awsome
2016-01-16 18:26:42	@J	I like the part where the Breadbug gets air
2016-01-16 18:26:51	Neocraftz1553	ooh yeah
2016-01-16 18:26:56	Raymoo	It's absolutely beautiful
2016-01-16 18:27:03	Neocraftz1553	It was overshooting its own den
2016-01-16 18:27:05	Raymoo	I say that too much
2016-01-16 18:27:08	Neocraftz1553	flying over it
2016-01-16 18:27:41	@J	I think it hit a treasure and ramped on it
2016-01-16 18:27:53	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 18:28:03	Raymoo	the glint beetle flies
2016-01-16 18:28:05	Raymoo	it FLIES
2016-01-16 18:28:06	Raymoo	AAAAAAA
2016-01-16 18:28:19	ScruffyChat	100 is also apparently the saem
2016-01-16 18:28:45	Raymoo	I'm going to go and steal my brother's P2 rom and start poking around inside
2016-01-16 18:28:50	Raymoo	Just gotta scrub it first
2016-01-16 18:28:55	Raymoo	I wonder how that's done
2016-01-16 18:29:22	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 18:29:23	Raymoo	I'm going to copy his rom and figure out how to scrub it
2016-01-16 18:29:26	Raymoo	I don't know how do
2016-01-16 18:29:27	Raymoo	D:
2016-01-16 18:29:43	Neocraftz1553	hey, anyone know a good free video editor?
2016-01-16 18:29:49	Raymoo	Hmm
2016-01-16 18:29:59	Raymoo	Audacity for separate sound, and Avidemux I think
2016-01-16 18:30:21	Raymoo	Avidemux is free and simple
2016-01-16 18:30:23	Neocraftz1553	damn, my computer sounds like its taking off
2016-01-16 18:30:34	Raymoo	For a nice, fully featured vid editor, get Sony Vegas. Expensive, but very powerful
2016-01-16 18:30:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah ik
2016-01-16 18:30:48	Neocraftz1553	I tried the free trail
2016-01-16 18:30:49	@Espyo	OpenShot is releasing its first beta soon, I think
2016-01-16 18:31:05	Neocraftz1553	its like 90+ dollers sony vegas
2016-01-16 18:31:10	@Espyo	oh, I'd make another video like that, if I found any more interesting parameters
2016-01-16 18:31:19	@Espyo	but that's pretty much most of them right there in that video
2016-01-16 18:31:27	Raymoo	i thought it was $600
2016-01-16 18:31:27	Testyo	$ 600 = 551.82 € / £ 389.94 
2016-01-16 18:31:35	Raymoo	really testyo
2016-01-16 18:31:36	Testyo	after all I'm I know
2016-01-16 18:31:44	Neocraftz1553	Lol
2016-01-16 18:31:46	@Espyo	so did I
2016-01-16 18:31:51	Neocraftz1553	$100
2016-01-16 18:31:51	Testyo	$ 100 = 91.97 € / £ 64.99 
2016-01-16 18:31:54	@Espyo	I thought Vegas as more than $500
2016-01-16 18:31:54	Testyo	$ 500 = 459.85 € / £ 324.95 
2016-01-16 18:32:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 18:32:23	Neocraftz1553	the least expensive I saw it for was around 120$
2016-01-16 18:32:32	Neocraftz1553	wrong side of the number
2016-01-16 18:32:34	Raymoo	Audacity is my most program
2016-01-16 18:32:36	Neocraftz1553	$120
2016-01-16 18:32:36	Testyo	$ 120 = 110.364 € / £ 77.988 
2016-01-16 18:32:40	Raymoo	I use it constantly
2016-01-16 18:32:58	Raymoo	I have at least four windows open at any time, of Audacity, I promises you
2016-01-16 18:33:15	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 18:33:26	Raymoo	I've also made some really stupid tracks with it
2016-01-16 18:33:27	Neocraftz1553	brb, going to download avidemux
2016-01-16 18:33:32	Raymoo	Have fun
2016-01-16 18:34:03	Raymoo	Scruffy, you use blender, correct?
2016-01-16 18:34:18	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-16 18:34:30	Raymoo	I've been trying to learn to Blender and failing miserably
2016-01-16 18:34:36	ScruffyChat	It's tricky
2016-01-16 18:34:44	Raymoo	I just don't have the patience
2016-01-16 18:34:45	Neocraftz1553	yes, it is kinda hard at first
2016-01-16 18:34:49	ScruffyChat	I want to release videos about it, but then I realize that's been done
2016-01-16 18:34:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 18:35:12	ScruffyChat	I at least want to make a video of an example of how I make an image on Pikmin Fanon
2016-01-16 18:35:20	Raymoo	You should
2016-01-16 18:35:23	Raymoo	No reason not to
2016-01-16 18:35:24	@J	OpenShot had loads of releases already didn't it?
2016-01-16 18:35:29	Pikminfan27	I need Blender help.

2016-01-16 18:35:34	Raymoo	Any tutorials you'd reccomend?
2016-01-16 18:35:36	Raymoo	go download it
2016-01-16 18:35:38	Neocraftz1553	that one
2016-01-16 18:35:41	Raymoo	oh wait, use a tutorial
2016-01-16 18:35:43	Neocraftz1553	^
2016-01-16 18:35:57	Neocraftz1553	ita the one I used
2016-01-16 18:36:01	Neocraftz1553	*its
2016-01-16 18:36:09	Neocraftz1553	Its a PDF
2016-01-16 18:36:24	Neocraftz1553	for blender 2.6, but it works with 2.7
2016-01-16 18:36:39	ScruffyChat	And if you have any questions about Blender, I'm happy to do my best to answer them
2016-01-16 18:36:43	@Espyo	<J> OpenShot had loads of releases already didn't it?
2016-01-16 18:36:45	@Espyo	I'm actually not sure
2016-01-16 18:36:56	@J	I used it years ago I think
2016-01-16 18:36:58	@Espyo	I mean, it's a program under Linux that has existed for years now
2016-01-16 18:37:10	@Espyo	but recently...ish, it got a reboot and was made multiplatform, and a lot better
2016-01-16 18:37:11	@J	oh, and they only recently got to beta on Windows?
2016-01-16 18:37:15	@J	ah, that makes sense
2016-01-16 18:37:20	Raymoo	my no-name recorder broke my drive
2016-01-16 18:37:27	@J	there's also PiTiVi, but that might be Linux-only too
2016-01-16 18:37:56	ScruffyChat	This is so weird
2016-01-16 18:38:10	Neocraftz1553	what
2016-01-16 18:38:15	ScruffyChat	{fp01}: 20, 40, 100, and 200 seemed to have no difference
2016-01-16 18:38:19	Raymoo	wait what
2016-01-16 18:38:31	Neocraftz1553	for the pikmin 2 project
2016-01-16 18:38:42	ScruffyChat	But at 400 the Bulborb gets up and follows me to a certain point, that's not even the edge of its territory
2016-01-16 18:38:47	ScruffyChat	Then disappears, without a trace
2016-01-16 18:38:48	@J	and Cinelerra, if they ever got around to fixing it
2016-01-16 18:38:49	Raymoo	it deleted the fangame engine again
2016-01-16 18:38:54	Neocraftz1553	did you try 23, 25, and 34
2016-01-16 18:39:53	ScruffyChat	I'll try, but I doubt they'll be much different from 20
2016-01-16 18:39:59	Neocraftz1553	o
2016-01-16 18:40:23	Neocraftz1553	Raymoo http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_fangame_engine#Download
2016-01-16 18:40:39	Neocraftz1553	there it shows what to do for MAC and LINUX
2016-01-16 18:40:42	Raymoo	I still have it it's just that I have to keep screaming at my antivirus
2016-01-16 18:41:00	Neocraftz1553	Let it through your antivirus/firewall
2016-01-16 18:41:37	Raymoo	 55/10
2016-01-16 18:41:39	Raymoo	totally logic
2016-01-16 18:42:06	Pikminfan27	I'm going to get the fangame engine, bye!

2016-01-16 18:42:41	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 18:42:56	ScruffyChat	23 is the same
2016-01-16 18:43:05	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 18:43:29	ScruffyChat	Perhaps it's how it reacts to the ground
2016-01-16 18:43:38	Neocraftz1553	uhm... anything else you can edit besides {fp:01}?
2016-01-16 18:43:50	Neocraftz1553	yes, maybe
2016-01-16 18:45:08	ScruffyChat	Yes, but I'm just trying to collect some more observations on it first
2016-01-16 18:45:30	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 18:46:06	Neocraftz1553	I might be able to help by doing what your doing as soon as I finish doing some things and getting dolphin to work, scruffy
2016-01-16 18:46:15	ScruffyChat	At 300 it disappears, but farther from its home
2016-01-16 18:46:26	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-16 18:46:41	ScruffyChat	You know, it might be how it reacts to face slopes on the map
2016-01-16 18:47:09	ScruffyChat	Since the surface it's on, the sewer lid, is sloped down at the edges
2016-01-16 18:47:33	Neocraftz1553	hey, acruffy, what version of dolphin are you using
2016-01-16 18:47:43	Neocraftz1553	*scruffy
2016-01-16 18:48:10	ScruffyChat	4.0 - 8291
2016-01-16 18:48:46	Neocraftz1553	Stable version?
2016-01-16 18:49:07	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-01-16 18:49:14	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 18:51:19	ScruffyChat	at 1000 it's displaced above the ground, and starts walking at weird slopes in the air when it walks around
2016-01-16 18:52:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-01-16 18:52:49	ScruffyChat	This is definitely how it reacts to geometry of the area
2016-01-16 18:53:10	ScruffyChat	at 800 it's only displaced a little, but it acts as though every slope is a hill upwards
2016-01-16 18:54:41	ScruffyChat	It's very odd how it handles moving up and down
2016-01-16 18:54:47	ScruffyChat	slopes, that is
2016-01-16 18:55:09	@Espyo	probably makes sense for the devs
2016-01-16 18:55:11	@Espyo	not so much for us
2016-01-16 18:55:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 18:55:26	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 18:55:43	ScruffyChat	Should I add that info to the template, or just leave it unknown?
2016-01-16 18:57:08	Neocraftz1553	I guess
2016-01-16 18:57:13	ScruffyChat	Definitely a ground collisions thing
2016-01-16 18:57:16	ScruffyChat	You guess what?
2016-01-16 18:57:44	Neocraftz1553	you should add the info
2016-01-16 18:57:50	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure
2016-01-16 18:58:34	@Espyo	add it to the template
2016-01-16 18:58:38	@Espyo	like...
2016-01-16 18:58:44	@Espyo	"Unknown (related to slopes)"

2016-01-16 19:07:41	ScruffyChat	I never actually thought I'd be able to do this editing thing, it's so much fun
2016-01-16 19:08:03	ScruffyChat	Now I'm trying that weird one {Fp33} selection per polygon with 4 50.000000 # map
2016-01-16 19:08:14	@J	yeah, we're really lucky they're all plain text files
2016-01-16 19:09:15	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-01-16 19:09:48	Yoshi2	on the other hand, I guess it makes sense they are plain text because they are easier to adjust that way
2016-01-16 19:09:51	Yoshi2	for developers
2016-01-16 19:10:13	@J	yeah, but they could easily have decided to obfuscate them
2016-01-16 19:10:30	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 19:10:39	@J	or just write an editor that works with binary files

2016-01-16 19:15:52	Testyo	I guess since it has to load all those textures and useless the info is

2016-01-16 19:18:44	@Espyo	> Strangely, there is a Yellow Spectralid behind the dirt wall that leads to the Astringent Clump. It flutters in place, and is too far up to be interacted with. Its positioning is most likely a mistake, as it is hard to spot and can only be seen when the camera angle is turned a certain way.
2016-01-16 19:18:47	@Espyo	(Garden of Hope)
2016-01-16 19:18:49	@Espyo	I really can't find it
2016-01-16 19:21:54	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I found that
2016-01-16 19:22:20	@Espyo	what exactly is the gate?
2016-01-16 19:22:26	@Espyo	because I don't think it's the one for the Astringent Clump
2016-01-16 19:23:00	ScruffyChat	They mean near the entrance to the sub-area with the Astringent Clump and the elevator platforms
2016-01-16 19:23:32	ScruffyChat	That's blocked off by a dirt wall
2016-01-16 19:24:09	ScruffyChat	In that area (it's lined with bricks) there's a Yellow Spectralid flying around, and I have been able to lock on to it but it flies well into the transition area
2016-01-16 19:24:54	Neocraftz1553	its like, nope, not today
2016-01-16 19:25:27	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-16 19:25:34	@Espyo	so getting it early in the day is my best bet
2016-01-16 19:25:36	@Espyo	ok, thanks
2016-01-16 19:26:46	ScruffyChat	{fp33} hasn't done anything yte
2016-01-16 19:27:09	@J	the comment mentions map like 01, so it's probably also a weird geometry thing
2016-01-16 19:27:26	@Espyo	I'm not seeing it...
2016-01-16 19:27:34	@Espyo	probably
2016-01-16 19:27:57	@Espyo	ok, looking at the files...
2016-01-16 19:28:07	@Espyo	there's this Yellow Spectralid on the main "room" of the Garden of Hope
2016-01-16 19:28:10	@Espyo	at Z = 2033
2016-01-16 19:28:13	@Espyo	which seems to be quite high up
2016-01-16 19:28:34	@Espyo	the White Spectralids in the area don't go above 1400
2016-01-16 19:28:48	@Espyo	sigh, am I really going to create a tool to visualize enemy positions?
2016-01-16 19:28:51	@Espyo	because I don't/want to
2016-01-16 19:29:02	ScruffyChat	yeah, the main room
2016-01-16 19:29:16	ScruffyChat	Near the Yellow Wollywog there's a dirt wall
2016-01-16 19:29:28	@Espyo	yeah, this is the place for sure
2016-01-16 19:29:29	ScruffyChat	behind the dirt wall is a path lined with bricks
2016-01-16 19:29:30	@Espyo	but I can't see it anywhere
2016-01-16 19:29:37	ScruffyChat	It's difficult to spot
2016-01-16 19:29:42	ScruffyChat	And it never land
2016-01-16 19:29:47	ScruffyChat	lands*
2016-01-16 19:29:48	@Espyo	nuts
2016-01-16 19:30:59	@Espyo	no turning back now, I'm creating a tool to plot the objects
2016-01-16 19:31:20	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-01-16 19:31:30	@Espyo	I'm going to create a tool that reads the Pikmin 3 files
2016-01-16 19:31:36	@Espyo	and then draws the position of each enemy on an image
2016-01-16 19:31:50	@Espyo	...you're ONLY creating a project, visual studio
2016-01-16 19:31:50	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-01-16 19:32:03	@Espyo	you don't have to steam like you're trying to calculate the 50th thousand prime
2016-01-16 19:32:22	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 19:32:53	Yoshi2	or trying to break a 2048 bit RSA encryption
2016-01-16 19:32:55	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-01-16 19:32:57	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 19:32:58	@Espyo	hey J?
2016-01-16 19:32:59	Yoshi2	which comes down to calculating primes anyway
2016-01-16 19:33:01	@Espyo	oh, and Yoshi2
2016-01-16 19:33:11	@Espyo	is there any good and simple way to output to an image file in Python?
2016-01-16 19:33:17	@Espyo	because if so, screw visual studio and screw C++
2016-01-16 19:33:22	@Espyo	I could use Python for this
2016-01-16 19:34:03	@J	you mean programmatic image editing?
2016-01-16 19:34:09	ScruffyChat	Well, setting {fp33} to 50000 crashed the load of VoR
2016-01-16 19:34:10	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-16 19:34:20	@Espyo	like image.placePixel(35, 60)
2016-01-16 19:34:22	@J	there's a good library for it, trying to remember the name
2016-01-16 19:34:24	@J	PIL I think
2016-01-16 19:34:35	@J	you could also use pygame, actually
2016-01-16 19:34:35	@Espyo	image.createCircle(50, 60, 100)
2016-01-16 19:34:43	@Espyo	do I really want to go that far, though=
2016-01-16 19:34:44	@Espyo	*?
2016-01-16 19:34:47	@Espyo	I just want an image, really
2016-01-16 19:34:49	@J	pygame doesn't have many shapes with AA, though
2016-01-16 19:35:11	@J	well, depends on if this script is for distributing and stuff, or just a quick thing
2016-01-16 19:35:12	Yoshi2	if you are going to use PIL, you should use Pillow which is a fork of PIL
2016-01-16 19:36:12	@J	never heard of Pillow, and the website doesn't really tell you why it exists
2016-01-16 19:36:17	@J	just that it's a fork of PIL
2016-01-16 19:36:37	Neocraftz1553	hey eapyo, found a bug ish thing on the engine, hope you dont mind
2016-01-16 19:36:44	Neocraftz1553	*espyo
2016-01-16 19:36:51	Yoshi2	the main reason for the existance of pillow is that pillow supports py3 and PIL doesn't
2016-01-16 19:36:53	@Espyo	sure
2016-01-16 19:37:00	@Espyo	just a quick thing
2016-01-16 19:37:11	ScruffyChat	I can't find anything on {fp33} yet
2016-01-16 19:37:18	@Espyo	well, I was thinking of 2.7, so *shrug*
2016-01-16 19:37:42	@J	I guess you're auto-generating diagrams from some data files?
2016-01-16 19:37:46	Neocraftz1553	If you grab a pikmin and whistle at the same time the pikmin either A: follows you and you can no longer make it do tasks like building bridges
2016-01-16 19:37:50	@Espyo	exactly
2016-01-16 19:38:03	@Espyo	...now to find out how to work with this
2016-01-16 19:38:04	Neocraftz1553	or B: just stands there and stares at you
2016-01-16 19:38:04	Yoshi2	http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/imaging/ apparently OpenCV is also a thing, but I never used that myself
2016-01-16 19:38:06	@Espyo	there's no documentation
2016-01-16 19:38:19	@J	also, you probably don't want to use it for this, but did you know GIMP has Python scripting?
2016-01-16 19:38:19	@Espyo	hm, I'll take a look, then
2016-01-16 19:38:21	@Espyo	thank you, Neocraftz1553
2016-01-16 19:38:31	Neocraftz1553	no prblem
2016-01-16 19:38:32	@Espyo	I... might've known ages ago
2016-01-16 19:38:33	@J	no doc for what?
2016-01-16 19:38:37	@Espyo	no doc for PIL
2016-01-16 19:38:41	@Espyo	http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ wow, nothing
2016-01-16 19:39:20	@J	it's in the download
2016-01-16 19:39:27	@J	download source, open Docs/index.html
2016-01-16 19:39:27	@Espyo	not on the exe, though
2016-01-16 19:39:30	Neocraftz1553	oh, and espyo, you have to whistle first then attemp to throw the pikmin
2016-01-16 19:39:36	@Espyo	right
2016-01-16 19:39:48	@Espyo	is the Pikmin you're whistling the same one you're trying to grab?
2016-01-16 19:40:15	Yoshi2	pillow has pretty docs https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.1.x/
2016-01-16 19:40:18	@J	http://effbot.org/imagingbook/ 
2016-01-16 19:40:29	@J	I never used PIL anyway
2016-01-16 19:40:36	@Espyo	...why do developers insist on not having a quick start guide
2016-01-16 19:40:42	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-01-16 19:40:44	@Espyo	yes, it's good to have all functions documented
2016-01-16 19:40:51	@Espyo	but what help is that going to be if I don't know which one to start on?
2016-01-16 19:41:01	Neocraftz1553	it is the one you already have in tour squad
2016-01-16 19:41:02	@Espyo	plus I learn 50 times faster from an example than from a giant list of everything
2016-01-16 19:41:09	@J	see my link
2016-01-16 19:41:23	@Espyo	so you whistle an idle Pikmin at the same time you grab a Pikmin in your squad?
2016-01-16 19:41:35	Neocraftz1553	get pikmin -> Whistle and attempt to throw
2016-01-16 19:41:52	Neocraftz1553	you dont have to whistle at a pikmin
2016-01-16 19:41:57	@Espyo	ah, that helps, J
2016-01-16 19:41:57	@Espyo	thanks
2016-01-16 19:42:05	@Espyo	and I'll take a look at pillow if PIL ends up being crap
2016-01-16 19:42:07	@Espyo	thanks Yoshi2
2016-01-16 19:42:16	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-16 19:42:32	@Espyo	so basically, you hold down right click and start holding left click?
2016-01-16 19:42:56	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-16 19:43:01	@J	well good luck, I'm going to be busy for a while now
2016-01-16 19:44:32	ScruffyChat	{fp28} is definitely a cap on maximum rotation speed
2016-01-16 19:44:49	@Espyo	thank you
2016-01-16 19:44:53	@Espyo	well, installation worked nicely
2016-01-16 19:45:06	ScruffyChat	It apparently has more influence than {fp08}, rotation speed
2016-01-16 19:45:11	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-01-16 19:45:18	@Espyo	maybe rotation speed is actually rotation acceleration?
2016-01-16 19:45:25	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2016-01-16 19:45:32	@Espyo	wait
2016-01-16 19:45:35	@Espyo	there are two rotations
2016-01-16 19:45:38	@Espyo	for Bulborbs, at least
2016-01-16 19:45:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah actually
2016-01-16 19:45:43	@Espyo	one for standing still, one while moving
2016-01-16 19:45:47	ScruffyChat	fp08 is called "rotation speed rate"
2016-01-16 19:45:57	ScruffyChat	fp28 affected both rotations
2016-01-16 19:46:00	@Espyo	speed rate? hah, that has acceleration written all over
2016-01-16 19:46:02	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-16 19:46:20	ScruffyChat	it took forever for it to turn around to get me, and then it could barely walk in anything but a straight line
2016-01-16 19:46:31	ScruffyChat	It looked even more ridiculous than usual

2016-01-16 19:49:44	ScruffyChat	Ohhhhh that's scary
2016-01-16 19:50:07	ScruffyChat	It just gets up and shoots its head over to me like "WHAT DID YOU JUST DO"
2016-01-16 19:50:23	@Espyo	oh, I see how

2016-01-16 19:51:08	Neocraftz1553	sometimes he repeats some quotes from other users :P
2016-01-16 19:52:30	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-01-16 19:52:31	Testyo	Even though it you in particular
2016-01-16 19:52:37	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-01-16 19:52:38	Testyo	when the image with the season switcher + its upgrades came out, I thought it was different
2016-01-16 19:52:59	@Espyo	he always repeats quotes
2016-01-16 19:53:05	@Espyo	he grabs two quotes at random and merges them
2016-01-16 19:53:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah, {fp08} is some sort of multiplier for rotation acceleration
2016-01-16 19:53:08	@Espyo	rarely, he uses a quote directly
2016-01-16 19:53:15	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 19:53:27	Neocraftz1553	once he used one from scruffy :P
2016-01-16 19:53:31	Neocraftz1553	kinda
2016-01-16 19:53:59	ScruffyChat	Because with high rotation speed (40 instead of 4) and fp08 at 0.1 instead of 0.4, the Bulborb will start moving toward its targets even if its rotation missed the mark
2016-01-16 19:54:29	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-16 19:54:41	ScruffyChat	And its rotation speed will be slow, but will accelerate and decelerate still
2016-01-16 19:55:43	Neocraftz1553	vroom vroom

2016-01-16 20:00:42	@Espyo	Testyo: last message
2016-01-16 20:00:43	Testyo	I said Pikmin 3 has so, a bit of work because Neocraftz1553 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages Pikmin 3 has so, so many plants in it and that sounds like quite a bit of work.
2016-01-16 20:00:55	@Espyo	but if you want to play around with Testyo, I'd recommend going on #Testyo
2016-01-16 20:00:56	Testyo	...so i feel the Wii U could have handled was plant translucency

2016-01-16 20:01:04	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-16 20:01:14	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I've noticed
2016-01-16 20:01:38	Neocraftz1553	how do I get back
2016-01-16 20:02:18	ScruffyChat	{fp32} is a LOD radius
2016-01-16 20:02:36	ScruffyChat	Specifically, it's how far beyond a boundary can it remain drawn
2016-01-16 20:03:01	ScruffyChat	At 0.00, once something's center is just a hair off-screen, the whole thing disappears
2016-01-16 20:03:26	ScruffyChat	But the Red Bulborb has a radius of 40.00, so that its whole body is off-screen before it disappears
2016-01-16 20:03:56	@Espyo	oh, so that's what they mean by LOD
2016-01-16 20:04:12	@Espyo	makes sense in retrospect
2016-01-16 20:04:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 20:07:36	Neocraftz1553	hello I am back

2016-01-16 20:14:46	ScruffyChat	{fp34} is the radius at which Pikmin can hurt the Bulborb without latching on
2016-01-16 20:14:59	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-01-16 20:15:10	ScruffyChat	normally its 30 for Red Bulborb, about the radius of the Red Bulborb
2016-01-16 20:15:10	Neocraftz1553	like standing next to the bulborb?
2016-01-16 20:15:36	ScruffyChat	but set to 100, they can stand substantially away from the Bulborb and still attack it /and damage it/
2016-01-16 20:16:01	@Espyo	oh, that thing is per-enemy, huh?
2016-01-16 20:16:03	@Espyo	interesting
2016-01-16 20:16:09	Neocraftz1553	heheh, set it to 250
2016-01-16 20:16:20	ScruffyChat	I set it to 400 and the Pikmin backed up so far away from the Bulborb that eventually they just went idle and didn't attack
2016-01-16 20:16:30	ScruffyChat	But they can also still latch on
2016-01-16 20:16:34	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-01-16 20:16:46	ScruffyChat	If they got shaken off though, they'd try backing away again
2016-01-16 20:17:01	ScruffyChat	It seems to be the /only/ radius at which Pikmin can inflict damage not latching on
2016-01-16 20:17:21	Neocraftz1553	interesting
2016-01-16 20:18:00	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-01-16 20:18:14	@Espyo	right
2016-01-16 20:18:18	ScruffyChat	Which is why Pikmin go for the Bulborb's legs when they get up after being shaken
2016-01-16 20:18:44	@Espyo	right
2016-01-16 20:18:51	@Espyo	guess it makes sense to definite it per-enemy, then
2016-01-16 20:19:15	<--	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@128.177.hjs.gjm) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-01-16 20:19:25	ScruffyChat	Right, since enemies have different radii on the ground than their normal radii
2016-01-16 20:19:43	ScruffyChat	The same does not work for leader punches though
2016-01-16 20:19:48	ScruffyChat	Those only work on contact
2016-01-16 20:20:30	ScruffyChat	So maybe {fp33} is punch distance
2016-01-16 20:20:32	ScruffyChat	Time for a test
2016-01-16 20:25:52	ScruffyChat	okay, never mind
2016-01-16 20:25:58	ScruffyChat	still don't know what that does
2016-01-16 20:27:17	Chiaki_Nanami	what is this {fp33}
2016-01-16 20:27:20	Chiaki_Nanami	i
2016-01-16 20:27:45	Chiaki_Nanami	im so confused
2016-01-16 20:28:30	ScruffyChat	I got nothing
2016-01-16 20:28:42	ScruffyChat	But if set to 50000 the area crashes, doesn't load
2016-01-16 20:29:14	ScruffyChat	Otherwise I can't see what it affects
2016-01-16 20:29:37	ScruffyChat	google translate says {Fp33} selection per polygon with 4 50.000000 # map
2016-01-16 20:29:46	ScruffyChat	or, "selection per polygon with map"
2016-01-16 20:30:17	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-16 20:30:48	ScruffyChat	fp12 is sight radius
2016-01-16 20:31:01	ScruffyChat	if set to zero he'll wake up, look around, and go back to sleep
2016-01-16 20:31:07	@Espyo	right
2016-01-16 20:31:12	ScruffyChat	He'll only bite if you're standing right under him
2016-01-16 20:32:42	ScruffyChat	Heh, I already changed the lighting file to create night mode, so I've been testing all these in night lighting
2016-01-16 20:33:42	ScruffyChat	Interesting that it's sight is bigger than its territory
2016-01-16 20:34:26	ScruffyChat	So if it's chasing you through a wall you have to get farther away than its territory
2016-01-16 20:36:47	ScruffyChat	I've gotta get going for now
2016-01-16 20:37:05	ScruffyChat	But I'll do some more tests the next chance I get
2016-01-16 20:37:08	ScruffyChat	This is fun
2016-01-16 20:37:58	Yoshi2	it really is
2016-01-16 20:38:25	Yoshi2	just takes some time due to having to restart the game on each change
2016-01-16 20:38:48	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-16 20:38:51	ScruffyChat	I don't mind though
2016-01-16 20:39:04	ScruffyChat	it's just that my frame-skipper works intermittently
2016-01-16 20:39:22	ScruffyChat	So I need to remember not to close Dolphin on a time that pressing TAB works
2016-01-16 20:40:30	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-16 20:40:33	@Espyo	all right, see you later
2016-01-16 20:41:34	@Espyo	well, I got something
2016-01-16 20:42:14	@Espyo	on my plotter thing, I mean
2016-01-16 20:44:21	ScruffyChat	Oh?
2016-01-16 20:44:37	@Espyo	they're all over the place, but seem organized
2016-01-16 20:44:43	@Espyo	now to overlay it on a map...
2016-01-16 20:47:02	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-16 20:47:30	@Espyo	I uh
2016-01-16 20:47:32	@Espyo	must've done something wrong
2016-01-16 20:47:41	@Espyo	either that, or there's an enemy out of bounds
2016-01-16 20:47:41	@Espyo	like
2016-01-16 20:47:46	@Espyo	REALLY far out of bounds
2016-01-16 20:47:49	@Espyo	I tried to calculate automatically what size the image should be at
2016-01-16 20:47:56	@Espyo	and it's saying 12 thousand pixels in width
2016-01-16 20:49:48	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-01-16 20:49:52	@Espyo	there are some enemies out of bounds
2016-01-16 20:49:56	@Espyo	unless I'm reading this file all wrong
2016-01-16 20:57:15	Yoshi2	the only way to confirm that is to get the edges of the map and compare them to the enemy position
2016-01-16 20:57:38	@Espyo	thing is, the maps are nuts
2016-01-16 20:57:45	@Espyo	if the models are anything to go by, they're a nightmare
2016-01-16 20:57:56	@Espyo	anyway, I can just overlay on GIMP and try to tweak it manually
2016-01-16 20:59:54	@Espyo	it's really hard
2016-01-16 20:59:59	@Espyo	a number of factors could be off
2016-01-16 21:00:02	@Espyo	the scale is almost a given
2016-01-16 21:00:09	@Espyo	(since I'm not going to create a 12k by 12k image)
2016-01-16 21:00:10	Testyo	12 K = -261.15 °C / -438.07 °F
2016-01-16 21:00:27	@Espyo	the translation is also a given, since the reference image I'm using is a texture from the game, but I don't know the origin
2016-01-16 21:00:31	@Espyo	and the rotation could also be wrong
2016-01-16 21:00:43	@Espyo	who knows if what the game considers north in the coordinates is the same north the texture is facing
2016-01-16 21:00:57	@Espyo	plus it doesn't help when you have the dots all scattered about without any categorization
2016-01-16 21:01:21	@Espyo	...hey, the center looks to be the landing site
2016-01-16 21:01:29	@Espyo	oh, and that must be the Drake!
2016-01-16 21:01:31	@Espyo	I think I've got it
2016-01-16 21:02:58	@Espyo	eh, iunno
2016-01-16 21:03:06	@Espyo	well, I guess I'll try the carrying paths
2016-01-16 21:03:08	@Espyo	those might make more sense
2016-01-16 21:04:30	@Espyo	...really?
2016-01-16 21:04:42	@Espyo	nodes on paths have a list of 8 other nodes they can link to
2016-01-16 21:04:45	@Espyo	the list HAS to be 8 long
2016-01-16 21:04:51	@Espyo	even if most of them are just pointing to a null node
2016-01-16 21:04:58	@Espyo	kinda dumb, but ok
2016-01-16 21:10:35	Yoshi2	wow, the younger me would've LOVED obs
2016-01-16 21:11:00	@Espyo	obs?
2016-01-16 21:11:06	@Espyo	isn't that that streaming program?
2016-01-16 21:11:13	Yoshi2	open broadcaster software, yeah
2016-01-16 21:11:19	Yoshi2	but it can also output to file
2016-01-16 21:11:24	@Espyo	ooh, nice
2016-01-16 21:11:25	@Espyo	didn't know
2016-01-16 21:13:22	Yoshi2	it's a semi-decent screen recorder that is also not a complete pain to use and the performance seems to be not bad at all
2016-01-16 21:13:51	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-16 21:14:18	Yoshi2	and it's free
2016-01-16 21:14:51	Yoshi2	now I'll try to use this to record some dolphin stuff

2016-01-16 21:48:38	Yoshi2	hmm, there is one thing that really puzzles me about OBS
2016-01-16 21:49:05	Yoshi2	you have this canvas of a specific size that you can put stuff on

2016-01-17 12:41:24	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-17 12:41:26	Testyo	yeah, I haven't used Miiverse much, but it looks like people enjoy it
2016-01-17 12:41:32	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-17 12:44:55	Yoshi2	I figured out a recording setup that seems to work well enough
2016-01-17 12:45:18	Yoshi2	record lossless in OBS, then encode that to whatever format you want with the bitrate you want with ffmpeg
2016-01-17 12:45:26	@Espyo	hmm, seems good
2016-01-17 12:51:18	Yoshi2	you know what I hate most? Those videos that show off cool stuff in a game but don't write in the description how to actually do that cool stuff
2016-01-17 12:51:30	Yoshi2	so I'm spending time adding that description to my video
2016-01-17 12:51:43	@Espyo	I ALWAYS explain everything on my descriptions
2016-01-17 12:51:47	@Espyo	precisely because of that
2016-01-17 12:51:58	@Espyo	but I guess people don't bother explaining in the description because nobody reads it
2016-01-17 12:52:06	@Espyo	honestly, it's like the video description isn't a box that describes the video
2016-01-17 12:52:08	@Espyo	it's like a virus
2016-01-17 12:52:15	@Espyo	or the depths of a canyon
2016-01-17 12:53:13	Yoshi2	people who are worth your time will always read the description
2016-01-17 12:53:18	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-17 12:53:29	Yoshi2	noobs who don't even read the video description can stay away
2016-01-17 12:53:35	@Espyo	people who ask things that are answered in the description will receive just as much attention as they gave the description: 0
2016-01-17 12:54:58	@Espyo	I'm loving the /r/cemu subreddit
2016-01-17 12:55:10	@Espyo	 1% posts discussing the future of the emulator

2016-01-17 13:17:05	Yoshi2	yuuuuuup
2016-01-17 13:17:57	@J	when I do screen recording, I encode somewhat while doing it, because my CPU is fast and my disk isn't especially
2016-01-17 13:19:59	Yoshi2	I'd do that, but if I let OBS do the encoding, the result looks like crap for some odd reason
2016-01-17 13:20:06	Yoshi2	the colors are very off
2016-01-17 13:20:50	@J	strange
2016-01-17 13:21:01	@J	the recorder I use actually uses ffmpeg internally
2016-01-17 13:21:56	@J	so yeah, I'm trying to use xcb, and the documentation is basically, 'we try to name stuff so you can kind of guess how to do things from the xorg specification'
2016-01-17 13:22:15	@J	would be okay if I vaguely knew what I was doing
2016-01-17 13:24:15	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-17 13:25:35	@J	I basically took a somewhat unrelated tutorial, plus the code for the window manager I use, and mixed them together, and after fixing compiler issues, suddenly a window
2016-01-17 13:34:34	Yoshi2	my download is garbage right now, but my upload hasn't changed much

2016-01-17 13:35:02	Yoshi2	at least the video will finish uploading soonish

2016-01-17 14:58:06	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-17 14:58:15	ScruffyChat	I was looking more through the Pikmin 2 files yesterday nigth
2016-01-17 14:58:28	ScruffyChat	And I found the parameters for leaders
2016-01-17 14:58:31	@Espyo	oh?!
2016-01-17 14:58:39	@Espyo	where?
2016-01-17 14:58:56	@J	invincible flying super-fast Olimar sounds amazing
2016-01-17 14:59:11	@Espyo	sounds like adding adjectives to Maxwell on Scribblenauts
2016-01-17 14:59:31	ScruffyChat	In the "user" folder, under "Abe", in the folder "piki"
2016-01-17 14:59:47	ScruffyChat	There are "Pikiparms" for Pikmin and "NaviParms" for leaders
2016-01-17 14:59:56	ScruffyChat	One is how much leaders weigh on seesaw blocks
2016-01-17 15:00:08	ScruffyChat	it's set to zero, but it /can/ be more
2016-01-17 15:00:21	@Espyo	...how did I never see these before...?
2016-01-17 15:00:48	ScruffyChat	Let's see, I know a few more...
2016-01-17 15:01:03	ScruffyChat	p001 is whistle radius
2016-01-17 15:01:15	ScruffyChat	And p002 is the minimum radius the whistle starts t
2016-01-17 15:01:18	@Espyo	I guess I must've seen it, because it's right here on my ISO map
2016-01-17 15:01:24	@Espyo	I wrote a simple text document that maps what folders do what
2016-01-17 15:01:50	@Espyo	it might be interesting to add these to the wiki, too
2016-01-17 15:01:52	ScruffyChat	Some of these I have yet to figure out
2016-01-17 15:02:08	ScruffyChat	p004 and p056 control running speed
2016-01-17 15:02:14	@J	I think I have one of those as well
2016-01-17 15:02:20	@J	a partial documentation of some files
2016-01-17 15:02:47	ScruffyChat	and I think four of them control reception of input from the control stick
2016-01-17 15:03:17	@Espyo	you had some files, some years ago, yeah
2016-01-17 15:03:49	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/p2disk.zip in case there's anything important in there

2016-01-17 15:04:33	ScruffyChat	It's also leaders that control Pikmin throw height and distance, not Pikmin themselves
2016-01-17 15:05:15	@J	well, have fun aggregating everything
2016-01-17 15:05:53	ScruffyChat	All Pikmin have a common running speed, and Purple and White have multipliers
2016-01-17 15:06:42	ScruffyChat	There are a bunch of parameters in the Pikmin file talking about bombs as though they are carryable
2016-01-17 15:06:55	ScruffyChat	{P066} 4 300.000000 # BOMB search distance {P067} 4 110.000000 # BOMB throw Min {P068} 4 160.000000 # BOMB throw Max {P069} and 4 1.500000 # BOMB Place escape time {P070} 4 150.000000 # BOMB throw speed {P071} 4 300.000000 # BOMB warning range {P072} between 4 0.650000 # BOMB, time {P073} 4 50.000000 # BOMB set distance
2016-01-17 15:07:09	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-17 15:07:17	@Espyo	well, leaders CAN throw bomb-rocks, in 2-player
2016-01-17 15:07:28	@Espyo	yeah, but those definitely sound like Pikmin
2016-01-17 15:07:31	@Espyo	unused content ho!
2016-01-17 15:08:21	ScruffyChat	Leaders have 50 life
2016-01-17 15:08:24	ScruffyChat	or, 50 HP
2016-01-17 15:08:44	ScruffyChat	So a Bulborb bite eats away 20% of that
2016-01-17 15:08:57	ScruffyChat	or 10% after the Metal Suit Z
2016-01-17 15:09:08	ScruffyChat	But the Metal Suit Z can also be changed~
2016-01-17 15:09:14	ScruffyChat	this is so much fun~
2016-01-17 15:09:16	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-17 15:09:29	Pikminfan27	I wish I could do that, too.
2016-01-17 15:09:39	Pikminfan27	I can't code.
2016-01-17 15:10:03	ScruffyChat	I'm not really coding, I'm just taking Pikmin 2's files and putting them in Google Translate
2016-01-17 15:10:13	Pikminfan27	Oh.
2016-01-17 15:10:31	ScruffyChat	And yesterday I finally found all the text messages in the game as well
2016-01-17 15:11:10	@Espyo	yeah, the bmg files
2016-01-17 15:11:19	ScruffyChat	Oh, Pikmin here have different radii of searching for things to do
2016-01-17 15:11:37	ScruffyChat	70 for enemies to attack
2016-01-17 15:11:54	ScruffyChat	45 for rubble and nectar weeds
2016-01-17 15:12:26	ScruffyChat	55 for pellets, 60 for bridges, and 45 for what I think are treasures, Google cals it "bargains
2016-01-17 15:12:30	@J	we really need to make a wiki that contains absolutely everything, stuff we wouldn't put on the main wiki or TCRF
2016-01-17 15:13:07	@J	because we've basically all done the same journey, discovering the same things again
2016-01-17 15:17:48	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-17 15:17:56	@Espyo	I mean, TCRF has a Notes: namespace

2016-01-17 15:23:36	ScruffyChat	They're all of the cave music themes
2016-01-17 15:23:45	@Espyo	they're something music related
2016-01-17 15:23:48	@Espyo	"conditionals"?
2016-01-17 15:23:55	@Espyo	like, what determines what instruments to pick
2016-01-17 15:23:56	@J	are they in archives?
2016-01-17 15:23:58	@Espyo	for carrying, battle, etc.
2016-01-17 15:24:05	@Espyo	I think they're out in the open
2016-01-17 15:24:10	@Espyo	i.e. not inside an szs file
2016-01-17 15:24:19	ScruffyChat	Oh, I found them in Conductor.szs

2016-01-17 15:26:12	@J	yes, it edits disk images
2016-01-17 15:26:21	@J	no, it can't create disk images from a folder
2016-01-17 15:28:09	Yoshi2	that's a bit too bad because I like editing files using external tools, drop them into the folder and then rebuild the image
2016-01-17 15:29:21	@J	yeah, you just have to import all the changed files

2016-01-17 15:31:47	@J	magic I guess
2016-01-17 15:31:54	@J	it just moves stuff around as necessary

2016-01-17 16:03:00	ScruffyChat	"wealthy"
2016-01-17 16:03:56	Pikminfan27	That makes perfect sense. They always give treasures or other valuable objects!
2016-01-17 16:05:20	Pikminfan27	Like spray?

2016-01-17 16:07:41	Pikminfan27	It downloaded as soon as I clicked the link. How do I know it isn't a virus?

2016-01-17 17:26:55	@Espyo	there might be some program that plots stuff in a 3D scene, if you just give it the coordinates of every point

2016-01-17 17:31:31	ScruffyChat	Or blender could do that

2016-01-17 19:58:29	@Espyo	...that's definitely bizarre
2016-01-17 19:58:33	@Espyo	the paper bag thing
2016-01-17 19:59:34	@Espyo	uhm, Yoshi2
2016-01-17 19:59:37	@Espyo	I didn't remember this at the time
2016-01-17 19:59:42	@Espyo	but you can dump the frames and audio on Dolphin
2016-01-17 19:59:46	@Espyo	and then compile them with any video editor
2016-01-17 19:59:51	@Espyo	to get a full-speed, full-quality video
2016-01-17 20:00:59	Yoshi2	hmm, the version of dolphin I have doesn't seem to have that feature
2016-01-17 20:01:19	Yoshi2	on windows, at least
2016-01-17 20:01:39	Yoshi2	considering that OBS works on linux, I could try the newer version of dolphin
2016-01-17 20:01:44	@Espyo	I'm using 4.0-7636

2016-01-17 20:05:41	Yoshi2	ah, I found the frame dump/audio dump thing now
2016-01-17 20:05:53	Yoshi2	but this means I'd need to find a way to put the two into one
2016-01-17 20:06:02	Lord_Juffowup	Im on mac, used wine to rip them, still worked
2016-01-17 20:07:20	Lord_Juffowup	I also used the sound where bowser takes a step in ssbm

2016-01-17 20:11:54	Neocraftz1553	idk
2016-01-17 20:12:22	Neocraftz1553	Probably like normal
2016-01-17 20:12:38	ScruffyChat	And also Dolphin dumps them in a file format called .raw, I'm not sure what to do with it
2016-01-17 20:13:16	Neocraftz1553	Find a program that opens .raw files
2016-01-17 20:13:21	Yoshi2	hmm, for me it dumps them into .avi
2016-01-17 20:13:22	Neocraftz1553	that is what I usually do
2016-01-17 20:14:10	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: issue is, raw is not really a format you can search a program for
2016-01-17 20:14:19	Neocraftz1553	isnt that a video format?
2016-01-17 20:14:57	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-17 20:15:15	Yoshi2	raw basically means uncompressed or compressed in a lossless way
2016-01-17 20:15:22	Yoshi2	and there are a tons of ways you could do that
2016-01-17 20:15:34	Neocraftz1553	sounds raw :P
2016-01-17 20:16:34	Yoshi2	though the video recorders I used output .avi for uncompressed, and my dolphin outputs avi too
2016-01-17 20:19:15	ScruffyChat	Hmm, there must be a way to set Dolphin's output method
2016-01-17 20:19:41	ScruffyChat	Or maybe it's just version specific, I have 4.0-8291
2016-01-17 20:21:19	Yoshi2	Espyo: 30 seconds of footage was almost 2 GB, I don't have that much free space
2016-01-17 20:21:37	Yoshi2	OBS could do 1 GB per 1 minute roughly
2016-01-17 20:21:48	Yoshi2	and didn't create a new file every 30 seconds
2016-01-17 20:22:05	Yoshi2	maybe the newer version of dolphin does it better, but I'm not sure

2016-01-17 20:58:03	@Espyo	EVERYTHING is different
2016-01-17 21:00:59	Yoshi2	step 1: replace files

2016-01-17 21:05:13	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-17 21:05:27	@Espyo	still, models, textures, sounds, music...
2016-01-17 21:06:12	Yoshi2	as long as you are only replacing stuff, there is a lot you can do in the game without having it crash
2016-01-17 21:07:17	ScruffyChat	It just takes an organized game like Mario Galaxy
2016-01-17 21:08:34	Yoshi2	when I was younger, I was amazed that codes could exist which changed the appearance of mario in SM64
2016-01-17 21:09:03	@Espyo	electronyoshi
2016-01-17 21:09:06	Yoshi2	because I thought everything had to be hardcoded into the game, so it shouldn't be possible to change the appearance

2016-01-17 21:41:33	ScruffyChat	That one's a triple pun
2016-01-17 21:41:39	ScruffyChat	Splat + toon + platoon
2016-01-17 21:41:59	@PikFan	"Marie, give us a pun!" "You know I hate puns! They're PUNberable!"
2016-01-17 21:42:23	@PikFan	oh yeah, wow
2016-01-17 21:42:30	@PikFan	I feel silly for not noticing that till now
2016-01-17 21:44:58	@Espyo	<PikFan> wouldn't you say so, Espyo?
2016-01-17 21:45:02	@Espyo	*shrug* Splatfest is pretty weird
2016-01-17 21:45:36	@PikFan	do you go with the less popular teams because you know they'll win
2016-01-17 21:50:16	@PikFan	oh also can I join you in Splatoon
2016-01-17 21:50:26	@PikFan	this time I'm using the tentatek splattershot
2016-01-17 21:51:03	@Espyo	I join whatever team I like
2016-01-17 21:51:09	@Espyo	and if I don't like any, I don't participate
2016-01-17 21:51:17	@Espyo	honestly, most EU Splatfests don't even deserve my attention
2016-01-17 21:51:20	@Espyo	poles... you have to be kidding me
2016-01-17 21:51:28	@Espyo	and sure, I'll boot in a bit
2016-01-17 21:51:29	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-17 21:51:41	@PikFan	hm, alright
2016-01-17 21:53:04	ScruffyChat	I've gotten a head-start on the Pikmin 2 night version
2016-01-17 21:53:50	ScruffyChat	En_Passant had a few ideas, do you have any for how the game could be more challenging in a night time version?
2016-01-17 21:54:01	ScruffyChat	Like, how enemies appear, or whatnot?
2016-01-17 21:55:45	@PikFan	hmmm
2016-01-17 21:55:57	@PikFan	not sure at the moment
2016-01-17 21:56:26	@PikFan	actually, maybe Bulborbs can walk faster and eat faster
2016-01-17 21:56:48	@PikFan	oh hey Espyo, you joined
2016-01-17 21:59:58	@PikFan	that kraken though
2016-01-17 22:00:20	@PikFan	wait, my team won?! I thought we were losing?!
2016-01-17 22:00:52	@Espyo	you were
2016-01-17 22:00:57	@Espyo	it's just Splatoon being stupid
2016-01-17 22:01:15	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-17 22:02:15	@PikFan	ScruffyChat, are you sure that you can handle such a big undertaking...?
2016-01-17 22:02:21	@PikFan	I mean, it's your biggest one yet
2016-01-17 22:03:45	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I know
2016-01-17 22:03:49	ScruffyChat	It's not too bad though
2016-01-17 22:04:00	ScruffyChat	I might not do the whole game
2016-01-17 22:04:04	ScruffyChat	But I should...
2016-01-17 22:04:25	ScruffyChat	It's just I'm worried that if I were to share it, it wouldn't work
2016-01-17 22:04:41	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-17 22:04:42	ScruffyChat	And also I don't know how to make .zip files
2016-01-17 22:04:53	@Espyo	ok then
2016-01-17 22:04:55	@PikFan	well, I know nothing about programming, so no help from me here
2016-01-17 22:04:57	@PikFan	?
2016-01-17 22:05:02	@Espyo	one of my teammates disconnected
2016-01-17 22:05:05	@Espyo	...except they didnt
2016-01-17 22:05:06	@Espyo	*didn't
2016-01-17 22:05:14	@Espyo	the squid symbols at the top represent your team
2016-01-17 22:05:24	@Espyo	one of our squids was marked as dead for the first 20 or so seconds
2016-01-17 22:05:30	@Espyo	so I just naturally assumed they disconnected
2016-01-17 22:05:35	@Espyo	suddenly, the icon returns
2016-01-17 22:05:39	@Espyo	and we turn it around
2016-01-17 22:05:45	@PikFan	that's happened to me too
2016-01-17 22:05:54	@PikFan	it's so bizarre...
2016-01-17 22:09:26	@PikFan	aaaaghhhh
2016-01-17 22:09:29	@PikFan	so clossseeeeee
2016-01-17 22:09:34	@Espyo	one of your teammates
2016-01-17 22:09:44	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-17 22:09:55	@PikFan	well, we still did pretty good
2016-01-17 22:10:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-17 22:13:04	@Espyo	right, let's join a new room
2016-01-17 22:13:06	@Espyo	this guy is disruptive
2016-01-17 22:13:20	@Espyo	I played a bit with him
2016-01-17 22:13:24	@PikFan	who?
2016-01-17 22:13:25	@Espyo	to try to even the teams out
2016-01-17 22:13:33	@Espyo	the sniper with like 10 points
2016-01-17 22:13:36	@Espyo	ATISA2
2016-01-17 22:13:41	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-01-17 22:13:51	@Espyo	he's playing to goof
2016-01-17 22:13:55	@Espyo	which is making the team he's on lose
2016-01-17 22:14:34	@PikFan	have you ever been in a squid party before
2016-01-17 22:14:39	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-17 22:14:45	@PikFan	heh, nice
2016-01-17 22:14:46	@Espyo	but come on, it becomes boring after a bit
2016-01-17 22:14:51	Yoshi2	I am so hyped for looking further in the battalion wars files, because apparently there might be an unused unit in the game
2016-01-17 22:15:43	Yoshi2	but that will have to wait until tomorrow :/
2016-01-17 22:16:42	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-01-17 22:18:10	@Espyo	heh, I know that feeling
2016-01-17 22:18:10	@PikFan	night
2016-01-17 22:18:36	@PikFan	ugh, there's a dynamo roller guy in this group
2016-01-17 22:18:45	@Espyo	uhm
2016-01-17 22:18:47	@Espyo	join our group
2016-01-17 22:18:55	@Espyo	<Espyo> right, let's join a new room
2016-01-17 22:19:02	@PikFan	I did
2016-01-17 22:19:08	@PikFan	I thought you were going to join me
2016-01-17 22:19:14	@PikFan	next match, then
2016-01-17 22:19:15	@Espyo	:|
2016-01-17 22:23:08	@Espyo	you have to join me
2016-01-17 22:23:12	@Espyo	because I play with other friends
2016-01-17 22:23:21	@PikFan	right
2016-01-17 22:23:22	@Espyo	if I join you, they need to wait one full match before joining me (and you)
2016-01-17 22:23:43	@PikFan	which ones? I know that you play with Gaming98, but I don't know who else
2016-01-17 22:26:36	@Espyo	sometimes Thomas or Ben join
2016-01-17 22:26:52	@Espyo	not today though; they just left a Smash tourney and are heading home right now
2016-01-17 22:27:25	@PikFan	don't know who they are, but okay

2016-01-17 22:30:52	@PikFan	snipers everywhere
2016-01-17 22:30:53	@Espyo	if I'm using the Krak-On
2016-01-17 22:30:58	@Espyo	and this stage is picked
2016-01-17 22:31:04	@Espyo	the opposing team is going to have a bad time
2016-01-17 22:31:10	@Espyo	I just set up camp on their side corridors
2016-01-17 22:31:13	@Espyo	and if they try to mess with my babies
2016-01-17 22:31:14	@Espyo	like you did

2016-01-17 22:35:04	@PikFan	hey Espyo, how long have you had Splatoon
2016-01-17 22:35:09	@Espyo	since launch
2016-01-17 22:35:20	@PikFan	that must be why I'm so bad
2016-01-17 22:35:29	@PikFan	haven't even had it for a month
2016-01-17 22:35:38	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-17 22:35:43	@PikFan	I leveled up way too fast
2016-01-17 22:35:44	@Espyo	you'll catch up
2016-01-17 22:35:47	@PikFan	and now I'm paying the price
2016-01-17 22:38:55	@Espyo	guess so
2016-01-17 22:39:05	@PikFan	in the first part of the battle I camped near the enemy base
2016-01-17 22:39:20	@PikFan	and I was hiding behind a bush and killing those who tried to pass
2016-01-17 22:43:10	@PikFan	that suction bomb was awesome
2016-01-17 22:43:18	@PikFan	I didn't even know you were there
2016-01-17 22:43:24	@Espyo	I was peeking behind the corner
2016-01-17 22:43:27	@Espyo	looked left and right
2016-01-17 22:43:30	@Espyo	"is it good to go?"
2016-01-17 22:43:33	@Espyo	"ok, HERE I GO"
2016-01-17 22:43:36	@Espyo	"...oh"
2016-01-17 22:43:45	@PikFan	hehe
2016-01-17 22:51:03	@PikFan	ugh
2016-01-17 22:51:19	@Espyo	squid beakons
2016-01-17 22:55:22	@PikFan	nice
2016-01-17 22:55:38	@Espyo	we had everything to win
2016-01-17 22:55:43	@Espyo	I honestly don't know what went wrong
2016-01-17 22:56:21	ScruffyChat	I'm noticing a pattern
2016-01-17 22:57:02	@PikFan	?
2016-01-17 22:57:40	ScruffyChat	Of someone having everything to win and honestly not knowing what went wrong :P
2016-01-17 22:59:15	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-17 22:59:22	@Espyo	PikFan: did you use my beakon?
2016-01-17 22:59:30	@PikFan	no
2016-01-17 22:59:32	@PikFan	why?
2016-01-17 22:59:43	@PikFan	didn't even notice it
2016-01-17 22:59:48	@Espyo	I'm trying to see if that spot on that corner is good or not
2016-01-17 22:59:52	@Espyo	and it survived for quite a while
2016-01-17 22:59:57	@Espyo	but I guess the enemy team can easily spot it
2016-01-17 23:00:13	@PikFan	*shrug*

2016-01-17 23:07:35	@Espyo	 1 or 2?
2016-01-17 23:07:45	@PikFan	I don't count
2016-01-17 23:07:49	@PikFan	why?
2016-01-17 23:07:56	@PikFan	also, I have terrible aim
2016-01-17 23:08:01	@Espyo	because I keep dying in a single hit from you

2016-01-17 23:11:45	@Espyo	it kills in 2-3 hits
2016-01-17 23:11:50	@Espyo	but it's killing ME in 1 hit
2016-01-17 23:11:53	@Espyo	I'm used to it
2016-01-17 23:12:02	@PikFan	I'm seeing it killing in 3

2016-01-17 23:37:26	@Espyo	and I couldn't find anybody
2016-01-17 23:37:30	@Espyo	so I just focused on spreading ink
2016-01-17 23:40:43	@Espyo	our team is great
2016-01-17 23:40:47	@Espyo	one day-1 charger
2016-01-17 23:40:53	@Espyo	and one roller that's not quite sure what they're doing
2016-01-17 23:40:55	@PikFan	gotcha
2016-01-17 23:41:07	@PikFan	I saw the squid beakon
2016-01-17 23:41:20	@PikFan	right after I destroyed it, I returned to the spawn point
2016-01-17 23:41:21	@Espyo	I jumped to it
2016-01-17 23:41:26	@PikFan	killed you from high above
2016-01-17 23:41:28	@Espyo	hmmmmmmmmmmm...
2016-01-17 23:41:34	@Espyo	you weren't meant to get me though
2016-01-17 23:41:37	@Espyo	I died in one hit
2016-01-17 23:41:46	@PikFan	...still?
2016-01-17 23:42:01	@PikFan	maybe I have a damage up or something

2016-01-17 23:45:39	@PikFan	yup
2016-01-17 23:45:42	@PikFan	I have a damage up
2016-01-17 23:45:48	@Espyo	it shouldn't be enough
2016-01-17 23:45:48	@PikFan	that's why
2016-01-17 23:46:05	@Espyo	it's just Splatoon's lag system
2016-01-17 23:46:10	@Espyo	by the time the other player's messages reach my end
2016-01-17 23:46:22	@Espyo	they say "oh, btw, this player hit you with 532 shots, you should be super dead now"
2016-01-17 23:46:27	@Espyo	so I just go from totally alive to totally not
2016-01-17 23:49:33	@Espyo	YOU WIZARD
2016-01-17 23:49:38	@Espyo	how did you super jump to me and LIVE?
2016-01-17 23:49:42	@Espyo	and still killed Gaming98?
2016-01-17 23:49:44	@Espyo	he went nuts on skype
2016-01-17 23:49:51	@PikFan	I
2016-01-17 23:49:52	@PikFan	don
2016-01-17 23:49:55	@PikFan	*don't
2016-01-17 23:49:57	@PikFan	know
2016-01-17 23:49:58	@PikFan	lag?
2016-01-17 23:50:15	@Espyo	maybe
2016-01-17 23:50:18	@PikFan	I just had the gun going as I was landing...

2016-01-17 23:57:59	@Espyo	because I camped at your base
2016-01-17 23:58:01	@PikFan	I completely wasted that beakon

2016-01-17 23:58:11	@Espyo	never mind

2016-01-17 23:58:21	@PikFan	and what are you talking about?
2016-01-17 23:58:32	@PikFan	no, I wasted it because I was killed right after I landed

2016-01-18 00:16:25	@PikFan	I know
2016-01-18 00:16:26	Neocraftz1553	I think BallsAngus
2016-01-18 00:16:42	Neocraftz1553	It looks like a red pikmin laughing at olimar
2016-01-18 00:17:01	Neocraftz1553	alright, adding in a glowstem to my render
2016-01-18 00:18:40	Neocraftz1553	I had to retexture it, and did so while we were talking
2016-01-18 00:19:07	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-18 00:19:27	@PikFan	so Scruffy's starting his P2 night mode project
2016-01-18 00:20:08	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-18 00:20:26	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure how good its going
2016-01-18 00:20:50	@PikFan	me either
2016-01-18 00:20:54	@PikFan	Scruffy was only on briefly
2016-01-18 00:20:59	Neocraftz1553	so far, we spent an entire day talking about what {{fp:01}} did
2016-01-18 00:21:38	Neocraftz1553	he said that it might have something to do with how a bulborb or an enemy reacts to the enviromwnt
2016-01-18 00:21:44	Neocraftz1553	enviroment
2016-01-18 00:21:59	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-18 00:22:05	@PikFan	Espyo might know
2016-01-18 00:22:09	@PikFan	but he just left...
2016-01-18 00:22:16	@PikFan	tomorrow, then
2016-01-18 00:22:24	Neocraftz1553	I am not sure, he was in the conversation as well
2016-01-18 00:23:32	Neocraftz1553	so this is what rendering with cycles is
2016-01-18 00:23:54	Neocraftz1553	add something, texture it, and preview render it to see how well it looks
2016-01-18 00:24:01	Neocraftz1553	or in my case:
2016-01-18 00:24:14	Neocraftz1553	add glowstem, retexture it
2016-01-18 00:24:38	Neocraftz1553	add two light sources, one in the glowstem, another just above it
2016-01-18 00:24:54	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-18 00:24:56	@PikFan	no idea
2016-01-18 00:25:01	Neocraftz1553	press F12, wait 30+ mins and hope for the best
2016-01-18 00:25:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-18 00:25:49	Neocraftz1553	scruffy said it "translated" to something... I think it was per the map
2016-01-18 00:26:00	@PikFan	hold on, I gotta go
2016-01-18 00:26:03	Neocraftz1553	ok

2016-01-18 19:31:15	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-18 19:31:16	Testyo	I'm sitting here and regretting staying to hear the solutions to attack than others
2016-01-18 19:31:21	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-18 19:56:04	Yoshi2	I've tested the frame dump feature in the newest dolphin version, and it is working much better
2016-01-18 19:56:12	Yoshi2	the speed seems to be fixed, too
2016-01-18 19:57:09	Yoshi2	but syncing the audio with the video would probably take quite a bit of work
2016-01-18 19:59:58	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-01-18 20:00:16	@Espyo	last time I used it, on the Onion 100 Pikmin discovery video, the speed was off
2016-01-18 20:00:25	@Espyo	but I did something to fix it, and it wasn't hard to do at all
2016-01-18 20:00:32	@Espyo	and synching the audio was simple too, IIRC
2016-01-18 20:12:00	Yoshi2	Espyo: what did you do to fix the speed issue and synch the audio?
2016-01-18 20:12:17	@Espyo	<Espyo> but I did something
2016-01-18 20:12:20	@Espyo	sorry, all I remember
2016-01-18 20:12:25	@Espyo	but it honestly wasn't anything special
2016-01-18 20:12:30	@Espyo	...I did use Sony Vegas
2016-01-18 20:12:34	@Espyo	split the video and audio
2016-01-18 20:12:43	@Espyo	and then I either moved them so that they'd synch, or changed the speed of one of them
2016-01-18 20:12:43	@Espyo	or both
2016-01-18 20:13:00	@Espyo	I've had to synch a lot of things back when I did Brawl videos
2016-01-18 20:13:12	@Espyo	so it's not this one time thing that it's impossible how I can't remember
2016-01-18 20:15:31	Yoshi2	weeeeeeell
2016-01-18 20:18:13	Yoshi2	I don't have sony vegas so that becomes more troublesome
2016-01-18 20:18:27	@Espyo	VirtualDub is great for things like these, though
2016-01-18 20:18:34	@Espyo	like, if you know what the problem IS
2016-01-18 20:18:42	@Espyo	if it's a matter of the audio being faster or slower than the video
2016-01-18 20:18:53	@Espyo	or if it's behind or ahead
2016-01-18 20:22:27	Yoshi2	I'll try virtualdub to see how much effort it is
2016-01-18 20:23:07	Yoshi2	if I don't have to speed up or slow down specific segments of the video, I'll do it more often
2016-01-18 20:40:07	Yoshi2	I searched through my files for some old code I wanted to reuse and found out that ages ago, I almost completely figured out the main structure of .res files in battalion wars
2016-01-18 20:40:36	@J	https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/How%20to%20speed%20up%20/%20slow%20down%20a%20video
2016-01-18 20:40:51	Yoshi2	I cleaned it up for python3 and put it here: https://github.com/RenolY2/battalion-tools/blob/master/rxet_parser.py
2016-01-18 20:40:57	@J	do that then you can write a script to do the same thing each time
2016-01-18 20:41:09	@J	if it's consistent

2016-01-18 21:11:15	Yoshi2	I looked at the code and really wondered how I managed to figure out so much, even if most stuff is unknown
2016-01-18 21:13:47	Yoshi2	but I guess a few somewhat educated guesses here and there get you far
2016-01-18 21:14:13	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-01-18 21:17:56	Yoshi2	there is a subreddit for bw modding that is pretty much dead, but one of the head mods is still active so maybe I can do something about that

2016-01-18 21:38:19	StarWolf	...
2016-01-18 21:38:35	En_Passant	What, is he not in Star Fox 0?
2016-01-18 21:39:37	En_Passant	Or do you mean his Smash career
2016-01-18 21:39:52	StarWolf	OH I had no idea what he was talking about. That's just a coincidence, UltraMarioMaker 
2016-01-18 21:40:02	UltraMarioMaker	smash 4
2016-01-18 21:40:08	UltraMarioMaker	yes
2016-01-18 21:40:09	UltraMarioMaker	:(
2016-01-18 21:40:20	UltraMarioMaker	he's in star fox zero tho
2016-01-18 21:44:25	En_Passant	so, this boss
2016-01-18 21:45:31	StarWolf	It's basically a Quaggled Mireclopps but on a MUCH grander scale
2016-01-18 21:46:44	StarWolf	like... It's bassicaly the entire area. 
2016-01-18 21:47:01	StarWolf	*basically 
2016-01-18 21:48:05	En_Passant	Oh yeah, that one
2016-01-18 21:50:21	En_Passant	I think it should be a giant turtle-like creature
2016-01-18 21:52:04	StarWolf	Like that thing on Avatar?
2016-01-18 21:52:45	En_Passant	idk
2016-01-18 21:52:54	En_Passant	It's been years since I saw that movie
2016-01-18 21:53:08	En_Passant	(unless you mean the Airbender one, in which case I've never seen it)
2016-01-18 21:53:20	En_Passant	But that turtle is likely based on the idea of the world turtle
2016-01-18 21:53:34	En_Passant	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Turtle
2016-01-18 21:55:25	StarWolf	ooooo cool
2016-01-18 21:57:44	En_Passant	So you exit the "area" (its shell) and awaken its face
2016-01-18 21:58:00	En_Passant	You somehow force your way into its body and kill it there
2016-01-18 22:01:22	StarWolf	I had an idea like that but was informed that it was a bit to gruesome for pikmin  
2016-01-18 22:02:06	En_Passant	Right. I was there for that, too
2016-01-18 22:02:24	En_Passant	Well, then I don't know how you plan on killing it
2016-01-18 22:04:03	StarWolf	wait! what if it's like the deku tree from OOT? where you kill something inside it to save it, and succeed, but it dies anyways?
2016-01-18 22:07:38	StarWolf	huh... but what would the new boss be? 
2016-01-18 22:08:21	En_Passant	hm
2016-01-18 22:08:30	En_Passant	A worm, maybe?
2016-01-18 22:08:53	En_Passant	Because worms burrow in the ground, and the turtle is acting as the ground
2016-01-18 22:09:11	En_Passant	Some worms are parasitic iirc
2016-01-18 22:10:53	StarWolf	ooooh I like that idea... 
2016-01-18 22:12:16	StarWolf	but what would it be called?

2016-01-18 22:15:58	En_Passant	I guess that depends on how simple you want it to be
2016-01-18 22:16:58	StarWolf	hmmm.... 
2016-01-18 22:17:46	En_Passant	Most canon enemies have two-word names and some pretty fancy vocab, like the Burgeoning Spiderwort and the Pilated Snagret
2016-01-18 22:18:28	En_Passant	The other boss you have is just "Wolpin" (wolf + scorpion), so I don't know if you want consistency with that
2016-01-18 22:19:00	StarWolf	I was looking for examples to see what it would look like.... remind me never to do it again...
2016-01-18 22:19:17	En_Passant	lol

2016-01-18 22:26:12	@PikFan	apparently because of "server maintenance"

2016-01-18 22:29:37	@PikFan	oh, since we're all here, now might be a good time to discuss a file licensing system
2016-01-18 22:29:52	StarWolf	oh, En_Passant, what could be a name for that parasite boss thing?
2016-01-18 22:29:56	StarWolf	oh
2016-01-18 22:29:58	StarWolf	okay
2016-01-18 22:30:33	En_Passant	StarWolf and I were discussing her area-boss before you guys came in
2016-01-18 22:30:41	@PikFan	the thing is, many images are user-made, so...
2016-01-18 22:30:43	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-18 22:32:09	@PikFan	looking at [[MediaWiki:Licenses]], the first five seem straightforward
2016-01-18 22:32:10	Testyo	"MediaWiki:Licenses" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Licenses
2016-01-18 22:32:21	StarWolf	Go on. I don't want people using my art all willy-nilly here. 
2016-01-18 22:32:22	@PikFan	then I don't know about the rest
2016-01-18 22:32:50	@PikFan	aren't they for images from other websites?
2016-01-18 22:33:30	Scruffy	Or for original images
2016-01-18 22:33:56	En_Passant	What about all the recolors?
2016-01-18 22:34:23	@PikFan	yeah, that's a gray area
2016-01-18 22:34:35	@PikFan	not sure about recolors
2016-01-18 22:34:46	Scruffy	They're all derivative works
2016-01-18 22:35:09	Scruffy	Technically they would need to be licensed by Nintendo
2016-01-18 22:35:39	@PikFan	aren't the original concept art images copyrighted?
2016-01-18 22:35:53	Scruffy	yES
2016-01-18 22:35:57	Scruffy	Yes*
2016-01-18 22:36:08	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-18 22:36:15	@PikFan	copyright...
2016-01-18 22:36:38	@PikFan	ok, so there's recolors
2016-01-18 22:37:00	@PikFan	then I've seen some pictures that were hand-drawn
2016-01-18 22:37:17	Scruffy	Those belong exclusively to the artists
2016-01-18 22:37:22	Scruffy	No matter what Disney says
2016-01-18 22:37:23	@PikFan	others were drawn in MS Paint
2016-01-18 22:37:28	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-18 22:37:32	StarWolf	As far as I know, and I'm most likely wrong, doesn't copyright stuff step in when you're claiming it's yours or trying to make money of of it?

2016-01-18 22:37:50	@PikFan	and recently we've been seeing 3D renders
2016-01-18 22:38:02	@PikFan	yeah, it does
2016-01-18 22:38:06	@PikFan	...I think
2016-01-18 22:38:07	Scruffy	You're not wrong, Starwolf, that's exactly where it comes in
2016-01-18 22:38:19	En_Passant	I think drawing/rendering softwares have CC licensing stuff already
2016-01-18 22:38:37	Testyo	oh, looking into it
2016-01-18 22:38:45	StarWolf	so as long as we don't claim the re colors or sell them, we should be fine, right?
2016-01-18 22:39:01	@PikFan	yeah, no money
2016-01-18 22:39:09	Scruffy	Right, it's just a matter of letting people know on the sight who has credit for the image
2016-01-18 22:39:20	En_Passant	What Scruffy said
2016-01-18 22:39:23	Scruffy	Since it's part Pikmin artists, part Nintendo, and part recolorer
2016-01-18 22:39:52	En_Passant	Legally, anything that's not properly documented counts as claiming to be an original work, I think
2016-01-18 22:40:09	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-18 22:40:10	En_Passant	Which is why channels with VG music get bopped all the time
2016-01-18 22:40:23	Scruffy	I'm a criminal guys
2016-01-18 22:40:30	@PikFan	oh no
2016-01-18 22:40:47	StarWolf	uh oh
2016-01-18 22:40:54	Scruffy	jk
2016-01-18 22:40:57	Scruffy	No, what I wrote is either original music or arrangements
2016-01-18 22:41:18	Scruffy	Arrangements are iffy in the music world, and generally require a mechanical license if I'm to make a profit with them
2016-01-18 22:41:23	Scruffy	But I'm not, so it's cool
2016-01-18 22:41:34	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-18 22:41:39	StarWolf	okay. 
2016-01-18 22:41:47	En_Passant	What about original depictions of canon content?
2016-01-18 22:42:01	En_Passant	Like my Pikmin artwork?
2016-01-18 22:42:10	Scruffy	Disney would get upset, but not Nintendo
2016-01-18 22:42:15	Scruffy	I think they like fanart
2016-01-18 22:42:25	Scruffy	Even if it contains canonical characters
2016-01-18 22:42:28	@PikFan	why Disney...?

2016-01-18 22:43:10	@PikFan	they recently made an official tumblr and they reshared some fanart
2016-01-18 22:43:17	Scruffy	I don't know, I just remember this cautionary tale of some kindergartner drawing Mickey Mouse and friends on the walls at her school, and either her or the school got sued
2016-01-18 22:43:33	StarWolf	woah
2016-01-18 22:43:36	@PikFan	lolwut
2016-01-18 22:44:20	Scruffy	just to say that some establishments care more about the non-substance of their intellectual property than others
2016-01-18 22:45:11	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-18 22:45:35	Scruffy	Anyway canon-based art on Pikmin Fanon is fine, it's just a matter of what license to give it
2016-01-18 22:45:41	@PikFan	hey J, what do you think of all this
2016-01-18 22:46:50	@PikFan	recolors are still different, right?
2016-01-18 22:47:13	@PikFan	because although you edited it, it was still originally made by someone else
2016-01-18 22:47:25	StarWolf	wait, on most fan art I've seen, the artist takes credit for the work, but gives the character/area idea credit to the original creator.

2016-01-18 22:47:48	StarWolf	and I'm sure that re-colors are different. 
2016-01-18 22:47:55	@PikFan	hmm, what does Pikifan4 want
2016-01-18 22:48:56	@PikFan	oh, he let me know about the community game
2016-01-18 22:49:15	@PikFan	imo it's just going to be another failed project
2016-01-18 22:49:54	Scruffy	Somebody had an idea about an ongoing fangame story though
2016-01-18 22:49:57	Scruffy	That seemed interesting
2016-01-18 22:50:08	@PikFan	there'll be initial excitement, but it'll die away, and the community game will be long forgotten
2016-01-18 22:50:18	Scruffy	As in, people would keep inputting what happens next in a fangame that doesn't exist
2016-01-18 22:50:29	StarWolf	unless it's something really cool
2016-01-18 22:50:46	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-18 22:51:03	@PikFan	anyway, back to licenses
2016-01-18 22:52:07	@PikFan	so, recolors, hand-drawn images, software-drawn images, and 3D renders
2016-01-18 22:52:18	@PikFan	any other type of image?
2016-01-18 22:52:28	StarWolf	ummm.... Nintendo should get cresit for re-colors because that's all they are. Re-colors

2016-01-18 22:53:53	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-18 22:54:00	En_Passant	Software-drawn images includes sprites, right?
2016-01-18 22:54:23	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-01-18 22:54:30	@PikFan	ok, yeah
2016-01-18 22:54:51	Scruffy	Yes, sprites are software-drawn

2016-01-18 22:55:51	@PikFan	but not anymore
2016-01-18 22:56:26	@PikFan	then, how would we license images from Pikipedia?
2016-01-18 22:56:37	@PikFan	because there's lots of them
2016-01-18 22:56:56	En_Passant	The same way Pikipedia licenses them?
2016-01-18 22:57:14	En_Passant	Fanon's technically an independent entity

2016-01-18 22:57:31	@PikFan	oh, duh
2016-01-18 22:57:37	@PikFan	the CC licenses
2016-01-18 22:58:15	@PikFan	because these images were taken from another source (Pikipedia)
2016-01-18 22:58:58	@PikFan	I mean, this is assuming they're from Pikipedia
2016-01-18 22:59:14	@PikFan	but where else would they come from?
2016-01-18 22:59:21	En_Passant	Only if they're original works created for Pikipedia
2016-01-18 22:59:42	En_Passant	Otherwise, they still belong to their original owners and need to be credited as such

2016-01-18 23:13:03	@J	they just have different clauses
2016-01-18 23:13:15	@J	by choosing a CC license you relinquish some of your rights as copyright holder
2016-01-18 23:13:33	@J	and different licenses relinquish different rights
2016-01-18 23:13:57	@J	eg. allowing commercial uses, allowing people to make changes and distribute them
2016-01-18 23:14:12	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-18 23:14:22	@J	https://creativecommons.org/choose/ it's just the 3 questions at the top
2016-01-18 23:14:43	@J	so I guess there are only 6 variants plus CC0
2016-01-18 23:15:29	@J	they used to have attribution as an option too, but hardly anyone used the ones not requiring attribution
2016-01-18 23:15:42	@J	so they got rid of them and you can use CC0 I guess
2016-01-18 23:16:25	@PikFan	hmm
2016-01-18 23:17:18	@PikFan	okay, and how would you license an image from another website?
2016-01-18 23:17:56	@J	depends if the website lists a license
2016-01-18 23:18:15	@J	if they don't, you can't put it on your website except under fair use
2016-01-18 23:18:21	@J	fair use being somewhat vague in general
2016-01-18 23:18:42	@J	educational uses would probably be the most common fair use claims
2016-01-18 23:18:53	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-18 23:19:17	@PikFan	but what about from a wiki? in this case, from Pikipedia
2016-01-18 23:20:27	@J	for example?  Most images on Pikipedia are labeled fair use, so it's the same as taking it from the original source

2016-01-18 23:22:48	@J	Nintendo will reserve all their rights, so the only way you're going to be able to use it is by claiming fair use
2016-01-18 23:23:02	PikFan2	okay
2016-01-18 23:23:33	PikFan2	does the same apply to screenshots of games?
2016-01-18 23:25:05	@J	yeah, it would count as a reproduction of their assets

2016-01-18 23:25:29	@J	fonts, even
2016-01-18 23:26:26	PikFan2	okay, so most images from Pikipedia would be licensed under fair use, then?

2016-01-18 23:26:39	PikFan2	I see
2016-01-18 23:26:44	@J	Wikipedia, as with most things, has a pretty good article on fair use

2016-01-18 23:28:02	PikFan2	there are quite a few images that have been edited, like recolored concept art images
2016-01-18 23:28:32	PikFan2	how would these be licensed?
2016-01-18 23:29:46	@J	as I understand it, that counts as a derivative work, which generally won't be allowed because Nintendo doesn't relinquish any of their exclusive rights
2016-01-18 23:30:00	@J	as in, the law says you're just not allowed to modify those images and redistribute them
2016-01-18 23:30:38	@J	which is a shame, but people are going to do it anyway, and Nintendo aren't going to take legal action because they're not losing any money from it
2016-01-18 23:30:51	@J	and no-one else is earning from it
2016-01-18 23:31:00	Scruffy	If anything they're gaining money from unwarranted publicity
2016-01-18 23:31:19	@J	eh, it's hard to argue that
2016-01-18 23:31:37	PikFan2	but these laws still exist if somebody decides to use them for profit
2016-01-18 23:31:41	@J	it's just as easy to say they might lose money by people looking at fan art rather than buying their games
2016-01-18 23:32:34	Scruffy	True
2016-01-18 23:32:44	En_Passant	What about original assets depicting copyrighted concepts? (fanart/renders/etc)

2016-01-18 23:34:52	@J	I believe it depends on how closely it's a 'copy' of a specific work
2016-01-18 23:35:14	@J	for example, you take that Red Bulborb image and redraw it, in the same pose, colours, etc. - that's probably a derivative
2016-01-18 23:35:31	@J	if you just draw 'a Red Bulborb', that's probably original work
2016-01-18 23:36:04	@J	though that's where trademark law comes into it
2016-01-18 23:36:28	Scruffy	Or if you use Nintendo's model in a 3D image, that's derivativ
2016-01-18 23:36:31	Scruffy	e
2016-01-18 23:36:45	@J	a company might have a registered trademark on a character or character's name, so drawings of the character or stories about the character might infringe on the trademark
2016-01-18 23:36:51	@J	I don't know much about trademark law though
2016-01-18 23:36:55	En_Passant	oh
2016-01-18 23:37:02	@J	and I don't know what trademarks Nintendo has
2016-01-18 23:37:17	@J	I guess Pikmin at least
2016-01-18 23:37:33	@J	possibly Olimar?  Not too likely, I guess
2016-01-18 23:37:50	PikFan2	so then, this would count as derivative, since it's based on concept art? http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:PF_Emperor_Bulblax.png
2016-01-18 23:37:57	@J	but I think you have to be somewhat misleading to infringe on a trademark

2016-01-18 23:39:13	@J	hmm, I'm not sure, I think there's something to be said for how much it's been changed
2016-01-18 23:39:21	@J	it really only shares the shape and pose
2016-01-18 23:39:26	Scruffy	I made that from scratch actually
2016-01-18 23:39:42	Scruffy	That's one of the few I've modeled from scratch
2016-01-18 23:39:50	@J	copying an existing image for the pose?
2016-01-18 23:39:57	@J	just the pose looks familiar?
2016-01-18 23:40:01	@J	*.
2016-01-18 23:40:05	Scruffy	Heh, copying multiple images including fanart
2016-01-18 23:40:22	Scruffy	But yes, mostly the Nintendo official image
2016-01-18 23:41:00	@J	so yeah, all the fanon stuff is going to be non-commercial and not really affect Nintendo's potential profits
2016-01-18 23:41:07	@J	so it comes down to how much it's been changed
2016-01-18 23:41:24	@J	and I don't think the law is so clear as to give exact guidelines on that
2016-01-18 23:41:50	PikFan2	a while back I hand-drew a map for one of my areas
2016-01-18 23:41:51	@J	it just has to be what you think is fair, really
2016-01-18 23:42:00	PikFan2	that's an original work, right?
2016-01-18 23:42:01	@J	how much effort Nintendo put in versus how much you put in
2016-01-18 23:42:11	@J	yeah, that sounds original
2016-01-18 23:42:26	Scruffy	Oh yeah, that map is quite original
2016-01-18 23:42:30	PikFan2	so I get to decide how I license it
2016-01-18 23:42:35	@J	yeah

2016-01-18 23:43:09	@J	but it's great to be asking questions about it
2016-01-18 23:43:30	@J	copyright law is pretty important nowadays

2016-01-18 23:45:23	PikFan2	yeah
2016-01-18 23:45:26	@J	I used it for custom levels I made for a game
2016-01-18 23:45:30	PikFan2	ah
2016-01-18 23:45:40	@J	I actually asked the game creators in that instance whether they were okay with it
2016-01-18 23:45:49	@J	not really possible with Pikmin...
2016-01-18 23:45:56	PikFan2	heh, yeah

2016-01-18 23:52:36	En_Passant	I thought we were starting with pages

2016-01-18 23:52:51	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-01-18 23:53:29	@PikFan	I like the format that Cyan Pikmin follows, though
2016-01-18 23:53:30	En_Passant	We should find some time to seriously go through with that
2016-01-18 23:53:39	@PikFan	I agree
2016-01-18 23:53:46	@PikFan	it's just very, very convoluted
2016-01-18 23:53:50	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-01-18 23:53:55	En_Passant	I don't like how Cyan does it
2016-01-18 23:54:03	@PikFan	how come?
2016-01-18 23:54:13	En_Passant	It doesn't organize the page by game
2016-01-18 23:54:50	En_Passant	Users don't have the freedom to say what they want about their version of the Cyan Pikmin
2016-01-18 23:54:59	@PikFan	do you see that as a problem because you can't link to a specific game?
2016-01-18 23:55:15	En_Passant	That too
2016-01-18 23:55:33	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-18 23:55:42	En_Passant	And it's too bland and repetitive to see the same list of games three times over for each aspect

2016-01-18 23:57:16	En_Passant	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Talk:Project_Clean_Up
2016-01-18 23:58:17	@PikFan	hmm
2016-01-18 23:58:37	@PikFan	thinking on it, it might be easier if we just did it in one page
2016-01-18 23:58:45	@PikFan	like, all the different types
2016-01-18 23:59:02	En_Passant	Well, that's what we do now
2016-01-18 23:59:13	En_Passant	... and the pages are giant messes
2016-01-19 00:00:35	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/VJ1xEF0w
2016-01-19 00:00:50	@PikFan	well, I mean, just sort them by type in one page
2016-01-19 00:00:58	@PikFan	like with Orange Pikmin, you divided them by type
2016-01-19 00:01:07	En_Passant	Yes, that was the first option of my proposal
2016-01-19 00:01:19	@PikFan	but we could use header 2 for the types and header 3 for specific games
2016-01-19 00:01:40	En_Passant	What do we do if an Orange Pikmin is both explosive resistant and some other common aspect?
2016-01-19 00:01:50	En_Passant	We can't put it on the page twice
2016-01-19 00:01:56	@PikFan	no header 4 for specific abilities because that'll make the TOC ridiculously long
2016-01-19 00:02:17	@PikFan	hmm... miscellaneous?
2016-01-19 00:02:45	En_Passant	It's not miscellaneous if it has common attributes
2016-01-19 00:03:08	@PikFan	maybe miscellaneous isn't the right word
2016-01-19 00:03:15	@PikFan	how about other?
2016-01-19 00:03:20	En_Passant	Which leads to the second option: Giving each type its own page
2016-01-19 00:03:36	En_Passant	That way, if a Pikmin has multiple attributes, it appears on multiple pages
2016-01-19 00:03:46	@PikFan	other is more inclusive than miscellaneous
2016-01-19 00:04:03	@PikFan	I should've said this before, when we started it
2016-01-19 00:04:17	@PikFan	but I'm not really too keen on dividing them up into different pages
2016-01-19 00:04:51	@PikFan	because that means [[Orange Pikmin (explosives)#Pikmin: The Key of Beginning|bla bla bla]]
2016-01-19 00:05:12	@PikFan	IMO it's easier if we get rid of the (explosives) bit
2016-01-19 00:05:42	En_Passant	That's option 3, leave them the way they are
2016-01-19 00:06:12	En_Passant	(Cyan's the only type that doesn't do it like that)
2016-01-19 00:06:19	@PikFan	right

2016-01-19 00:08:43	--	Mode #pikipedia [+o PikFan] by ChanServ
2016-01-19 00:08:54	@PikFan	sorry, firefox was being glitchy
2016-01-19 00:09:33	En_Passant	chrome
2016-01-19 00:09:45	@PikFan	but anyway, I think the pastebin I posted is the best option
2016-01-19 00:10:05	@PikFan	we don't have to separate them into individual pages, but we can still sort them by type
2016-01-19 00:10:59	@PikFan	and we can change "miscellaneous" to "other" so that we can include types that don't fit the rest of the types
2016-01-19 00:11:04	@PikFan	including combined types
2016-01-19 00:11:48	En_Passant	I think putting combined types in an Other section makes no sense
2016-01-19 00:11:58	@PikFan	why do you say that?
2016-01-19 00:12:16	En_Passant	"Other" implies that it's none of the above
2016-01-19 00:12:26	En_Passant	But it's multiple of the above
2016-01-19 00:13:00	En_Passant	It changes the definition of being sorted by type from "Pikmin with this attribute go here" to "Pikmin with *only* this attribute go here"
2016-01-19 00:13:10	En_Passant	Which is quite unintuitive
2016-01-19 00:13:20	Scruffy	Plus it alienates those ideas
2016-01-19 00:13:24	Scruffy	Under an "other" bin
2016-01-19 00:13:51	@PikFan	to be fair, I haven't seen any Pikmin types that combine traits
2016-01-19 00:14:03	@PikFan	or am I blind
2016-01-19 00:14:25	En_Passant	Brown Pikmin for sure have it
2016-01-19 00:14:34	En_Passant	I can't remember if Oranges do too
2016-01-19 00:14:49	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-19 00:15:03	@PikFan	okay, then we can make a section called "Combined traits"
2016-01-19 00:15:22	@PikFan	and list the Pikmin that have the combined traits
2016-01-19 00:16:04	En_Passant	Oh, wait, it was Black
2016-01-19 00:16:11	En_Passant	with Sticky and Sticky immune
2016-01-19 00:16:24	En_Passant	That could work, maybe
2016-01-19 00:16:59	En_Passant	I'd say I'm neutral on the idea
2016-01-19 00:27:03	Scruffy	Shouldn't it try to emulate Pikipedia's organization?
2016-01-19 00:27:22	@PikFan	yes, but it has to be more flexible
2016-01-19 00:27:56	@PikFan	also, I'm not really sure that people are going to write down mandatory and recommended uses for their Pikmin
2016-01-19 00:28:51	Scruffy	True
2016-01-19 00:29:48	Scruffy	Are we no longer using infoboxes?
2016-01-19 00:30:00	Scruffy	Since we'd have to use one for each game?
2016-01-19 00:30:26	En_Passant	We'd like to avoid it if possible
2016-01-19 00:31:36	En_Passant	Infoboxes are usually used to give an overview when there's a detailed article
2016-01-19 00:32:16	En_Passant	Most fanmade Pikmin types have very little information beyond what you can find in an infobox
2016-01-19 00:32:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 00:33:28	@PikFan	a Pikmin version of {{enemy stats}}

2016-01-19 00:40:39	@PikFan	I think that's a good solution
2016-01-19 00:41:47	En_Passant	How would it work?
2016-01-19 00:42:36	En_Passant	And what makes it different from an infobox?
2016-01-19 00:42:41	@PikFan	well, you know how the enemy stats template works, right?
2016-01-19 00:44:15	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-01-19 00:44:43	En_Passant	It was split off from the infobox template
2016-01-19 00:45:04	@PikFan	ok, so instead of the weight, seeds, value, etc, replace them with Pikmin-related stats
2016-01-19 00:45:14	@PikFan	like speed, carrying capacity, etc
2016-01-19 00:45:21	En_Passant	But what makes it better than just using an infobox?
2016-01-19 00:45:38	@PikFan	because you don't need more than 1
2016-01-19 00:45:43	@PikFan	you can have it right at the top
2016-01-19 00:46:00	En_Passant	Assuming each and every Pikmin of that type has the same stats, yeah
2016-01-19 00:46:01	@PikFan	similar to the enemy stats already on Pikipedia
2016-01-19 00:46:03	En_Passant	Fat chance of that
2016-01-19 00:46:44	@PikFan	uh
2016-01-19 00:47:31	@PikFan	don't all Pikmin share an attack power, running speed, carrying capacity, and a throw angle of sorts?
2016-01-19 00:47:38	@PikFan	even fan-made Pikmin?
2016-01-19 00:47:50	En_Passant	They have one
2016-01-19 00:48:17	En_Passant	But a stats table would be useless at the top of a page unless every variety on that page has the same numbers
2016-01-19 00:48:35	@PikFan	uh
2016-01-19 00:48:49	@PikFan	they don't need the same numbers...?
2016-01-19 00:49:13	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Red_bulborb#Stats
2016-01-19 00:49:20	En_Passant	Oh, I see what you're saying
2016-01-19 00:49:21	@PikFan	that doesn't have the same numbers
2016-01-19 00:49:30	En_Passant	Yeah, that would take up way too much room
2016-01-19 00:49:35	@PikFan	the same parameters, yes
2016-01-19 00:49:43	@PikFan	but the values can be different
2016-01-19 00:50:33	En_Passant	That table would be huge for the more popular types
2016-01-19 00:50:54	@PikFan	make it collapsible, then
2016-01-19 00:52:23	En_Passant	Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
2016-01-19 00:52:45	@PikFan	why? like 1 click is a huge issue
2016-01-19 00:53:10	En_Passant	It takes 1 click to jump to the section and get all of the info
2016-01-19 00:53:16	En_Passant	Instead of just the stats
2016-01-19 00:53:56	@PikFan	I honestly don't see any problems with a stats table
2016-01-19 00:54:02	@PikFan	even if it's long
2016-01-19 00:54:21	@PikFan	it's better than having tons of whitespace caused by infoboxes
2016-01-19 00:54:44	En_Passant	Can't we make collapsable infoboxes?
2016-01-19 00:54:57	@PikFan	probably, but I have no idea how to
2016-01-19 00:55:44	En_Passant	See what the other ones do, I guess
2016-01-19 00:56:09	@PikFan	other infoboxes?
2016-01-19 00:56:22	En_Passant	Other collapsable templates
2016-01-19 00:56:29	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-19 01:33:42	En_Passant	New theory!
2016-01-19 01:34:03	En_Passant	Swarming Sheargrubs are female Shearwigs
2016-01-19 01:34:19	@PikFan	heh, why?
2016-01-19 01:34:40	En_Passant	Well, they look similar to Female Sheargrubs and have coloration like Shearwigs
2016-01-19 01:35:07	En_Passant	Olimar's notes said that they spend their lives underground, but I don't think he's a very good biologist
2016-01-19 01:37:36	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-19 01:39:52	Scruffy	That's an interesting theory
2016-01-19 01:39:52	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-01-19 01:39:52	Scruffy	Makes sense
2016-01-19 01:41:54	En_Passant	I don't remember if I told you before, but in Pikmin V, Brittany writes the notes about their biology while Olimar's notes are strategies and locations
2016-01-19 01:42:14	@PikFan	no
2016-01-19 01:42:20	Scruffy	Good idea
2016-01-19 01:42:29	En_Passant	Several of her entries make contradictions to Olimar's prior notes
2016-01-19 01:42:36	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-19 01:43:20	En_Passant	or at least mention "new studies" to explain why their info or taxonomy has changed
2016-01-19 01:44:21	Scruffy	That's a better way to organize it than in Pikmin Forever
2016-01-19 01:44:26	Scruffy	In which Olimar just happens to have better biology notes
2016-01-19 01:44:34	Scruffy	Maybe DELTA should be the biologist
2016-01-19 01:45:45	En_Passant	If the shoe fits
2016-01-19 01:46:15	En_Passant	Mine's consistent with the reason I gave for Brittany returning to PNF-404 at all

2016-01-19 01:51:38	Scruffy	It's starting to feel more and more like a night mode

2016-01-19 02:04:58	Scruffy	How should I categorize the image?
2016-01-19 02:05:57	@PikFan	can't you post it to an image sharing website...?
2016-01-19 02:08:23	Scruffy	Oh, I was just going to upload it on Fanon
2016-01-19 02:08:23	Scruffy	It's about time I make a user subpage for it

2016-01-19 02:12:39	Scruffy	Thanks
2016-01-19 02:12:55	@PikFan	instead of a sun meter, it's a moon meter!
2016-01-19 02:13:19	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 02:13:40	Scruffy	And at the end of night (hopefully) it'll say "It's almost sunup. Hurry up!!"

2016-01-19 02:14:29	Scruffy	like a night-vision camera
2016-01-19 02:14:37	Scruffy	As though it's actually too dark to see in the caves
2016-01-19 02:14:41	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-19 02:14:56	Scruffy	Do you think that works? Or is that dumb
2016-01-19 02:15:08	@PikFan	well...
2016-01-19 02:15:13	@PikFan	it's not dumb
2016-01-19 02:15:31	@PikFan	but I'm not sure I'd like all sublevels in the game to be tinted green like that
2016-01-19 02:15:35	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 02:15:37	Scruffy	That's true
2016-01-19 02:15:41	Scruffy	Okay, I can change it
2016-01-19 02:15:46	@PikFan	it'd be straining on my eyes
2016-01-19 02:15:50	Scruffy	But I am at least going to tinker with cave colors
2016-01-19 02:16:11	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-19 02:16:24	Scruffy	And as you may have noticed, I've tinkered with the Snow Bulborbs
2016-01-19 02:16:37	Scruffy	See how they can see you from the other end of the cave?
2016-01-19 02:16:38	@PikFan	I wish there were more programmers, so that you guys could make a Pikmin 2 HD

2016-01-19 02:18:47	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-01-19 02:18:51	Scruffy	Any suggestions?
2016-01-19 02:19:49	En_Passant	I think some other dwarf Bulborb should be the ones to see you from anywhere
2016-01-19 02:20:01	Scruffy	Not snow?
2016-01-19 02:20:13	En_Passant	Yeah, it doesn't really fit their flavor
2016-01-19 02:20:18	Scruffy	yeah
2016-01-19 02:20:28	Scruffy	well, my rule is all enemies have to be changed in some way
2016-01-19 02:20:39	En_Passant	I like that rule
2016-01-19 02:20:48	En_Passant	I was thinking Dwarf Bulbears, but that would mess up following their parent
2016-01-19 02:20:53	En_Passant	So, probably Oranges
2016-01-19 02:21:18	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 02:21:20	Scruffy	That sounds good
2016-01-19 02:21:45	Scruffy	Heh, that also means they'll catch right on as soon as a Pikpik carrot is spawned in the Piklopedia
2016-01-19 02:21:54	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-19 02:22:25	En_Passant	Can't you change where and what enemies spawn?
2016-01-19 02:22:38	En_Passant	I know Espyo made a video where he replaced the Dwarf Red Bulborbs on CoC 8
2016-01-19 02:23:06	Scruffy	I saw that
2016-01-19 02:24:10	Scruffy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ1A8mTRO7Q
2016-01-19 02:24:32	En_Passant	I don't think you can do it with Pikmin, though
2016-01-19 02:25:01	En_Passant	Otherwise, you could start with Blues and get more out of Valley of Repose the first time around
2016-01-19 02:26:53	Scruffy	Yeah, I don't think I can do that
2016-01-19 02:28:56	Scruffy	I can make it so you can get Blue Pikmin earlier though, by changing the type of gate that blocks them in the AW
2016-01-19 02:31:36	Scruffy	I'm still learning, but I think I can make it work
2016-01-19 02:31:50	Scruffy	I've already been able to change values on the paper bags in the Valley of Repose
2016-01-19 02:37:00	En_Passant	Will the Man-at-Legs be Espyo's version?
2016-01-19 02:37:09	Scruffy	?
2016-01-19 02:37:17	Scruffy	Oh his edited version?
2016-01-19 02:37:21	Scruffy	Maybe
2016-01-19 02:37:35	Scruffy	I'd just have to ask him what the parameter changes were
2016-01-19 02:37:48	Scruffy	Ha! I just changed the number of Pikmin you find on day 1 from 5 to 50
2016-01-19 02:37:52	Scruffy	It worked
2016-01-19 02:38:51	Scruffy	They're all beating up that Dwarf Bulborb
2016-01-19 02:38:56	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-19 02:39:12	En_Passant	It can't die in the cutscene, right?
2016-01-19 02:40:41	Scruffy	no
2016-01-19 02:40:47	Scruffy	They just keep going at it

2016-01-19 02:42:03	Scruffy	But when I do, I'll do it
2016-01-19 02:42:08	@PikFan	nice
2016-01-19 02:50:47	Scruffy	I think I'm starting to get the hang of what these strings of random looking code mean
2016-01-19 02:51:17	Scruffy	then again, maybe not
2016-01-19 02:51:22	Scruffy	actually yeah, probably not
2016-01-19 02:51:36	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-19 02:51:57	En_Passant	It IS Pikmin 2's code
2016-01-19 02:52:10	En_Passant	I haven't seen it myselg, but Espyo says it's a nightmare
2016-01-19 02:52:17	En_Passant	*self
2016-01-19 02:53:23	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2016-01-19 02:53:29	Scruffy	Definitely nightmarish
2016-01-19 02:55:08	En_Passant	So what sorts of edit do you have in mind for other enemies?
2016-01-19 02:56:06	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-01-19 02:56:21	Scruffy	Giving some enemies more health
2016-01-19 02:56:27	Scruffy	But only a few, only where it counts
2016-01-19 02:56:39	Scruffy	Some get a more forceful shake
2016-01-19 02:56:45	Scruffy	Some notice you from farther away
2016-01-19 02:56:48	Scruffy	Some move faster
2016-01-19 02:56:53	Scruffy	or rotate faster
2016-01-19 02:57:23	Scruffy	And messing with enemy-specific parameters
2016-01-19 02:57:36	Scruffy	I'm not sure what they all are at the moment, but I'm going to experiment
2016-01-19 02:58:26	Scruffy	And also I was thinking of trying to eliminate some of the Exploration Kit upgrades
2016-01-19 02:58:48	Scruffy	Such as the treasure gauge
2016-01-19 02:59:03	Scruffy	Or the Metal Suit Z
2016-01-19 02:59:14	Scruffy	I know how to deal with the Metal Suit Z
2016-01-19 02:59:32	En_Passant	Can you edit the upgrades directly?
2016-01-19 02:59:50	Scruffy	Some of them; some parameters are right in the files for the leaders
2016-01-19 02:59:59	Scruffy	Others I don't quite know yet
2016-01-19 03:00:11	Scruffy	Like the Pluckaphone, I don't know how to access that one yet
2016-01-19 03:00:41	Scruffy	Oh, and all the ship's messages are going to change
2016-01-19 03:00:52	Scruffy	Either to reflect the night mode or just to be silly
2016-01-19 03:00:58	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-19 03:01:40	@PikFan	I have a question
2016-01-19 03:01:52	@PikFan	...and it kinda defeats the whole purpose of night mode, but...
2016-01-19 03:01:57	Scruffy	I don't know about changing the Piklopedia or Treasure Notes, that's a lot of stuff to change
2016-01-19 03:02:06	Scruffy	Oh, yes?
2016-01-19 03:02:15	@PikFan	Olimar reasons that they leave the surface at night to avoid the monsters, right?
2016-01-19 03:02:32	@PikFan	how are you going to deal with that?
2016-01-19 03:03:04	Scruffy	I'm just changing the text to say that they have to leave the surface during the day to avoid diurnal monsters
2016-01-19 03:03:11	Scruffy	There is no point
2016-01-19 03:03:22	Scruffy	It's not meant to be canonically sound
2016-01-19 03:03:30	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-01-19 03:04:15	@PikFan	yeah, I was thinking the only solution was if there's more monsters during the day
2016-01-19 03:05:36	En_Passant	Or they're nocturnal
2016-01-19 03:08:57	Scruffy	I need to test something
2016-01-19 03:09:18	Scruffy	Think of another silly name for Courage Reactor
2016-01-19 03:09:30	Scruffy	That is, 15
2016-01-19 03:09:37	En_Passant	15 characters?
2016-01-19 03:09:40	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 03:10:00	Scruffy	Whatever these messages are, they have to be the same amount of characters, even if I pad it with space
2016-01-19 03:10:03	Scruffy	spaces*
2016-01-19 03:10:10	En_Passant	Oh, darn
2016-01-19 03:10:21	En_Passant	Not just the same number of text boxes?
2016-01-19 03:10:31	Scruffy	Unfortunately no
2016-01-19 03:10:38	Scruffy	Or at least, that's what Espyo says
2016-01-19 03:11:46	@PikFan	Spirit Catalyst
2016-01-19 03:11:46	En_Passant	Infinite Powers
2016-01-19 03:12:00	@PikFan	...well then
2016-01-19 03:12:02	Scruffy	Ooh, I like Infinite Powers
2016-01-19 03:12:12	En_Passant	ninja'd
2016-01-19 03:12:16	Scruffy	Spirit Catalyst is good as well though
2016-01-19 03:12:29	En_Passant	Rename ALL the treasures
2016-01-19 03:12:33	Scruffy	Yessss
2016-01-19 03:12:44	Scruffy	This is going to become total parody
2016-01-19 03:12:56	@PikFan	parodies of parodies
2016-01-19 03:12:58	@PikFan	I love it
2016-01-19 03:13:06	@PikFan	brb
2016-01-19 03:13:25	Scruffy	I'm gonna test that out
2016-01-19 03:16:26	Scruffy	NO. FREAKING. WAY
2016-01-19 03:16:30	Scruffy	It worked
2016-01-19 03:16:38	@PikFan	yay!
2016-01-19 03:16:44	@PikFan	that's awesome!
2016-01-19 03:16:53	Scruffy	Alright, time to rename all of them
2016-01-19 03:17:10	@PikFan	wait, can you get a screenshot? I wanna see this for myself
2016-01-19 03:18:14	Scruffy	http://imgur.com/SVdxnBF

2016-01-19 03:19:27	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-19 03:20:37	Neocraftz1553	seems normal... until you look at the name
2016-01-19 03:20:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 03:20:48	Scruffy	I just learned how to change treasure names
2016-01-19 03:20:49	Neocraftz1553	did you do that?
2016-01-19 03:20:52	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-01-19 03:20:57	Scruffy	For the night mode game
2016-01-19 03:21:02	Scruffy	Only 200 more to go!
2016-01-19 03:21:20	Scruffy	If you guys think of any, post them here
2016-01-19 03:21:21	Neocraftz1553	hey Scruffy, I would like to ask for a small(ish) render
2016-01-19 03:21:24	@PikFan	the problem is, they have to be the same amount of characters
2016-01-19 03:21:28	@PikFan	wait
2016-01-19 03:21:37	Scruffy	I can pad it out with spaces
2016-01-19 03:21:49	Scruffy	It just can't get any longer than the original name
2016-01-19 03:21:57	@PikFan	oh, that's good
2016-01-19 03:21:59	Scruffy	Or... the thing is
2016-01-19 03:22:00	@PikFan	I was about to ask
2016-01-19 03:22:13	Scruffy	If one name got longer, another would just have to get the same amount shorter
2016-01-19 03:22:22	Scruffy	The whole document has to be a specific amount of characters
2016-01-19 03:22:24	Neocraftz1553	Can you make a Cyan Pikmin the same size as a White Pikmin with the Ice Pikmin's Frost with a Red Flower:
2016-01-19 03:22:33	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-19 03:22:38	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see
2016-01-19 03:22:39	@PikFan	so it's like a puzzle
2016-01-19 03:22:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-19 03:23:01	Scruffy	Yeah, but it's better for everyone if we just keep all the names their character length please
2016-01-19 03:23:13	@PikFan	heh, okay
2016-01-19 03:23:27	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-19 03:23:27	Scruffy	And Neocraftz1553, I certainly can
2016-01-19 03:23:37	Neocraftz1553	ok, thank you very much
2016-01-19 03:24:27	Neocraftz1553	I am attempting to make a Rock Pikmin >:D
2016-01-19 03:24:32	Scruffy	Cool
2016-01-19 03:24:37	Neocraftz1553	>: D
2016-01-19 03:24:44	Neocraftz1553	yeah, in Blender
2016-01-19 03:24:51	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-01-19 03:24:52	Neocraftz1553	It might be useful later on
2016-01-19 03:24:55	Scruffy	Awesome
2016-01-19 03:24:57	Scruffy	Definitely
2016-01-19 03:25:44	Neocraftz1553	So, we just have to name 200 treasures
2016-01-19 03:26:02	Scruffy	Yep, with names that have the same character count, including spaces
2016-01-19 03:26:10	Scruffy	And keep it silly, this is officially a parody
2016-01-19 03:26:18	Scruffy	That just happens to be hard mode
2016-01-19 03:26:22	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-19 03:26:41	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy, I need a tip
2016-01-19 03:27:02	Scruffy	What's up?
2016-01-19 03:27:19	Neocraftz1553	What kind of Lighting do yoi use to light up your Fan-Pikmin renders?
2016-01-19 03:27:31	Scruffy	It depends on the scene
2016-01-19 03:27:54	Neocraftz1553	No, like the Cyan Pikmin and all that

2016-01-19 03:28:37	Scruffy	For less realistic ones, like just models on a blank background, I use a sun lamp or spotlight lamps

2016-01-19 03:28:52	Scruffy	I add in a world background so that reflective bits actually reflect something
2016-01-19 03:29:12	Neocraftz1553	hmm... ok, thanks
2016-01-19 03:29:58	Neocraftz1553	Chapter 6 of the story
2016-01-19 03:31:06	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-01-19 03:31:30	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-19 03:31:41	Scruffy	I like how the Snagret Hole is now a rendezvous
2016-01-19 03:33:15	@PikFan	I originally had them land in front of the Red Onion, but decided against it
2016-01-19 03:33:37	@PikFan	because I want Ruby to reveal the Winged Pikmin
2016-01-19 03:34:31	@PikFan	also, did this line grab anybody's attention?
2016-01-19 03:34:34	@PikFan	"Oh! Oh! Should we tell them about the R—" another Winged Pikmin said, but was interrupted by the first one.
2016-01-19 03:34:44	Scruffy	Yeah, what is R—?
2016-01-19 03:34:52	@PikFan	guess
2016-01-19 03:35:10	Neocraftz1553	Uhh
2016-01-19 03:35:14	En_Passant	Rock Pikmin
2016-01-19 03:35:17	@PikFan	yup
2016-01-19 03:35:34	Scruffy	Ohhh
2016-01-19 03:35:36	Scruffy	Neat
2016-01-19 03:35:57	@PikFan	the Rock and Winged Pikmin actually travel together
2016-01-19 03:36:18	@PikFan	they're not a part of the Republic
2016-01-19 03:36:24	Neocraftz1553	Rock Pikmin
2016-01-19 03:36:29	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-19 03:36:51	En_Passant	So the Republic is just the original 3?
2016-01-19 03:37:00	@PikFan	plus Purple and White
2016-01-19 03:37:20	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy, you how when you open new 'screens' in blender
2016-01-19 03:37:41	Scruffy	Yeah?
2016-01-19 03:37:42	En_Passant	Have we just not seen them yet?
2016-01-19 03:37:47	Neocraftz1553	How do you get rid of them?
2016-01-19 03:37:56	@PikFan	yeah, they're coming soon
2016-01-19 03:38:11	@PikFan	by soon I mean in like 6 chapters
2016-01-19 03:38:14	Scruffy	If you have the latest version, you should be able to drag the little corner tab to get rid of them
2016-01-19 03:38:17	En_Passant	Are there Purple Elems?
2016-01-19 03:38:18	@PikFan	...so that's actually not really soon :P
2016-01-19 03:38:24	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-01-19 03:38:46	@PikFan	I...don't know
2016-01-19 03:38:51	@PikFan	Purple could be anything
2016-01-19 03:38:54	En_Passant	I want to say give them earth powers, but Rock Pikmin
2016-01-19 03:38:59	@PikFan	right
2016-01-19 03:39:06	En_Passant	Winged Pikmin will obviously be wind
2016-01-19 03:39:11	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-19 03:39:20	Neocraftz1553	Ultta-Violet?
2016-01-19 03:39:23	@PikFan	swordsmanship, maybe?
2016-01-19 03:39:26	Neocraftz1553	Blinding Light?
2016-01-19 03:39:33	@PikFan	oh, maybe
2016-01-19 03:39:33	En_Passant	uh...
2016-01-19 03:39:43	@PikFan	but...
2016-01-19 03:39:52	Scruffy	Gravity?
2016-01-19 03:39:56	En_Passant	Light-based powers on the darkest Pikmin type, which lives in caves?
2016-01-19 03:40:02	@PikFan	ooh
2016-01-19 03:40:09	Neocraftz1553	Oh, and thank you scruffy
2016-01-19 03:40:12	En_Passant	Gravity's not an element...
2016-01-19 03:40:18	Scruffy	Trrue
2016-01-19 03:40:19	Neocraftz1553	for thr blender thing
2016-01-19 03:40:39	En_Passant	Though I guess you could do something very un-sciencey and say gravity because black holes
2016-01-19 03:40:47	En_Passant	and/or give them darkness powers
2016-01-19 03:40:47	@PikFan	well, perhaps their Elems are varied
2016-01-19 03:40:59	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-01-19 03:41:15	Scruffy	Neo: no problem
2016-01-19 03:41:39	@PikFan	this is a good point, thanks for raising it
2016-01-19 03:41:45	Scruffy	Maybe Purple and White Pikmin don't have an Elem
2016-01-19 03:41:57	@PikFan	!
2016-01-19 03:42:00	@PikFan	plot twist
2016-01-19 03:42:11	Neocraftz1553	White pikmin: poison
2016-01-19 03:42:17	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-19 03:42:45	@PikFan	perhaps they specialize in other forms of attacks
2016-01-19 03:42:53	Neocraftz1553	Brute force
2016-01-19 03:43:08	@PikFan	oh, I know
2016-01-19 03:43:14	@PikFan	White Pikmin can be assassins
2016-01-19 03:43:15	@PikFan	or
2016-01-19 03:43:18	@PikFan	ninjas
2016-01-19 03:43:23	@PikFan	I like it
2016-01-19 03:43:32	@PikFan	...Scruffy
2016-01-19 03:43:40	@PikFan	I have a new render request
2016-01-19 03:43:47	En_Passant	So White "Elems" turn invisible?
2016-01-19 03:43:52	@PikFan	can you render a White Pikmin ninja?
2016-01-19 03:44:16	@PikFan	uh, what do you mean?
2016-01-19 03:44:37	@PikFan	they can't turn invisible (though that'd be neat)
2016-01-19 03:45:06	@PikFan	brb
2016-01-19 03:45:14	Scruffy	White Pikmin ninja?
2016-01-19 03:45:15	Scruffy	Maybe
2016-01-19 03:45:20	Scruffy	Yeah, sure, I guess
2016-01-19 03:45:25	Neocraftz1553	gotta love "subdivide"
2016-01-19 03:45:33	Scruffy	yeah, but not too much
2016-01-19 03:45:41	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-01-19 03:45:53	Scruffy	And after subdivide, do "smooth vertex"
2016-01-19 03:46:19	Neocraftz1553	woohoo, anothr thanks to scruffy
2016-01-19 03:46:42	En_Passant	It seems like if you're going with the theme of "special Pikmin with mastery over their element over just adapting to it" that there ought to be something magic-y
2016-01-19 03:46:57	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-01-19 03:47:17	En_Passant	Especially since they're intelligent, theoretically any Pikmin can learn how to be a ninja
2016-01-19 03:47:54	Scruffy	I don't know about White Pikmin ninjas
2016-01-19 03:48:01	Scruffy	Their big old bug-eyes would give them away
2016-01-19 03:48:10	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-19 03:48:26	En_Passant	and white's the most reflective (visible) color
2016-01-19 03:49:06	Scruffy	By the way, any ideas for "Insect Condo"?
2016-01-19 03:49:47	En_Passant	How about something related to the fact that many types of apples are red
2016-01-19 03:50:02	Neocraftz1553	Bugish Hotel
2016-01-19 03:50:08	Neocraftz1553	heh ok
2016-01-19 03:50:34	En_Passant	Infinite Powers wasn't a real good name, to be honest
2016-01-19 03:50:45	Scruffy	We can change it, but it was a perfect test
2016-01-19 03:51:43	En_Passant	Since it's the first treasure, we can call it the "Here Comes Cash"
2016-01-19 03:51:54	Scruffy	Love it, laughing out loud
2016-01-19 03:52:07	Neocraftz1553	Red Delicacy
2016-01-19 03:52:19	En_Passant	One of the more valuable treasures can be the "Get Rich Quick"
2016-01-19 03:52:19	Neocraftz1553	lol En_Passent

2016-01-19 03:53:15	En_Passant	Lustrous Element is 14 characters

2016-01-19 03:55:11	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-19 03:55:24	@PikFan	okay, yeah, White Pikmin ninjas wouldn't work
2016-01-19 03:55:33	@PikFan	I just thought maybe because they're fast
2016-01-19 03:56:00	@PikFan	so sure, maybe invisibility
2016-01-19 03:56:09	@PikFan	and then Purples manipulate gravity
2016-01-19 03:56:27	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-19 03:56:33	@PikFan	I don't care how many laws of physics I'm breaking with that, I'm going with it
2016-01-19 03:57:00	En_Passant	Well, conjuring fire breaks those laws, too
2016-01-19 03:57:08	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-01-19 03:57:16	En_Passant	That's the nature of magic
2016-01-19 03:57:20	@PikFan	indeed
2016-01-19 03:57:22	@PikFan	it
2016-01-19 03:57:30	@PikFan	*it's outside the realm of established science
2016-01-19 03:58:08	Neocraftz1553	and the magic of nature

2016-01-19 03:58:37	En_Passant	Oh, Scruffy
2016-01-19 03:58:41	En_Passant	Just thought of a good one

2016-01-19 03:58:45	Scruffy	Yesss
2016-01-19 03:58:49	En_Passant	Rubber Ugly --> Charlie's Pet

2016-01-19 03:59:11	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-19 03:59:26	En_Passant	Or, I guess it would be Charlie Pet
2016-01-19 03:59:39	En_Passant	Pet Charlie
2016-01-19 03:59:56	@PikFan	but then, what would we do about the Paradoxical Enigma?
2016-01-19 04:00:24	Neocraftz1553	I forgot what most of the treasures are
2016-01-19 04:01:03	En_Passant	Charlie Nightmare
2016-01-19 04:01:08	Neocraftz1553	can somebody lend me a hand?
2016-01-19 04:01:20	Scruffy	Close, one character too short
2016-01-19 04:01:28	En_Passant	... sucks not having room for " 's"
2016-01-19 04:01:29	Scruffy	But I could pad it unless someone thinks of another
2016-01-19 04:01:59	@PikFan	Elizabeth's Noggin
2016-01-19 04:02:13	Scruffy	That works
2016-01-19 04:02:48	Scruffy	Or Charlie Conspiracy
2016-01-19 04:02:52	En_Passant	Oh, I know
2016-01-19 04:02:58	En_Passant	Rubber Ugly is Pet Charlie
2016-01-19 04:03:04	En_Passant	And Paradoxical Enigma is Former Pet Charlie
2016-01-19 04:03:16	Scruffy	Hah

2016-01-19 04:03:27	@PikFan	Espyo's going to have a good laugh tomorrow
2016-01-19 04:03:36	Neocraftz1553	heh, yeah
2016-01-19 04:03:38	En_Passant	We need to name a treasure after him
2016-01-19 04:03:48	En_Passant	We can all have one
2016-01-19 04:03:55	Neocraftz1553	yus*

2016-01-19 04:05:33	En_Passant	Aquatic Mine --> And Knuckles

2016-01-19 04:07:06	Scruffy	I'll take it
2016-01-19 04:07:17	En_Passant	Do you have a list going?
2016-01-19 04:07:20	Scruffy	Don't ask me
2016-01-19 04:07:22	Scruffy	I do
2016-01-19 04:07:29	Scruffy	It might be Child of the Earth
2016-01-19 04:07:55	@PikFan	wait
2016-01-19 04:07:58	En_Passant	Extreme Perspirator is 19

2016-01-19 04:12:09	@PikFan	brb
2016-01-19 04:12:13	@PikFan	ok
2016-01-19 04:14:00	Scruffy	"I’ve Got The Longest Name"
2016-01-19 04:14:15	En_Passant	Does that fit exactly?
2016-01-19 04:14:19	Scruffy	Yep
2016-01-19 04:14:21	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-19 04:14:26	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-01-19 04:14:33	En_Passant	Stellar Orb --> Not UV Lamp
2016-01-19 04:14:44	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-19 04:15:26	Neocraftz1553	Im thinking up namea for us
2016-01-19 04:15:43	Neocraftz1553	Flare Cannon --> Espyo Engine
2016-01-19 04:16:20	En_Passant	I was thinking something blatantly not Espyo to name after Espyo
2016-01-19 04:16:39	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-01-19 04:16:56	En_Passant	Like, the Pink Menace
2016-01-19 04:17:01	@PikFan	Scruffy, is it possible to add new treasures?
2016-01-19 04:17:28	Scruffy	I'm gonna go ahead and say no.
2016-01-19 04:17:39	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-19 04:17:43	@PikFan	well, that's too bad
2016-01-19 04:18:00	Scruffy	It'd take new models, new collision data, new parameters, and trying to put it in a game that's already full
2016-01-19 04:18:18	Scruffy	Could be done, has been done as far as I know, but I can't do it
2016-01-19 04:18:59	@PikFan	mm
2016-01-19 04:19:05	En_Passant	Flame Tiller --> 2Kool4School
2016-01-19 04:19:08	En_Passant	Maybe?
2016-01-19 04:19:12	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-19 04:19:16	@PikFan	lol
2016-01-19 04:19:48	Scruffy	Heh , yeah
2016-01-19 04:19:52	Neocraftz1553	yup, it fit
2016-01-19 04:19:54	Neocraftz1553	s
2016-01-19 04:20:04	Scruffy	Right after all these are all the treasure notes
2016-01-19 04:20:18	Scruffy	"Looks like another all-nighter for me!"
2016-01-19 04:21:05	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-19 04:21:43	Scruffy	Um, I think 2Kool4School doesn't work
2016-01-19 04:21:51	Scruffy	If it's 2 words, the new name has to be 2 words
2016-01-19 04:21:53	Neocraftz1553	why?
2016-01-19 04:21:57	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-01-19 04:22:04	En_Passant	It has to be?
2016-01-19 04:22:07	Scruffy	Unless the words aren't split over two lines
2016-01-19 04:22:23	Neocraftz1553	 2Kool 4Skool
2016-01-19 04:22:27	Scruffy	Normally they are, but Stellar Orb or Boom Cone are short enough not to be
2016-01-19 04:22:30	En_Passant	That makes it not fight
2016-01-19 04:22:33	En_Passant	*fit
2016-01-19 04:22:34	Scruffy	Sorry
2016-01-19 04:22:49	En_Passant	Wait, you got rid of the h, never mind
2016-01-19 04:22:58	Scruffy	Oh yeah! That works
2016-01-19 04:23:03	Neocraftz1553	it fita
2016-01-19 04:23:09	Neocraftz1553	*fits
2016-01-19 04:23:10	En_Passant	hm
2016-01-19 04:23:16	En_Passant	Stellar Orb is 11
2016-01-19 04:23:18	En_Passant	Flame Tiller is 12
2016-01-19 04:23:27	En_Passant	So it might fit on one line?
2016-01-19 04:24:18	Scruffy	The thing is the text file is already organized one 
2016-01-19 04:24:30	Scruffy	sorry, so that the line breaks are all already there
2016-01-19 04:24:46	Scruffy	I fear if I change a line break then all the treasure names after it will be broken
2016-01-19 04:24:57	En_Passant	Oh, so it'd be like Flame<br>Tiller
2016-01-19 04:25:05	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-19 04:25:14	Scruffy	That's how it looks for all of them
2016-01-19 04:25:23	Scruffy	Except the ones that they decided to fit on one line
2016-01-19 04:26:12	Scruffy	I'll let you know if they are
2016-01-19 04:26:35	Scruffy	For example, Future Orb is divided, for some reason
2016-01-19 04:26:48	Scruffy	But Armored Nut is not
2016-01-19 04:27:09	Scruffy	Nor is Diet Doomer, Pale Passion, Milk Tub, or Boom Cone
2016-01-19 04:28:20	Scruffy	Woah
2016-01-19 04:28:26	Neocraftz1553	Why would they do that?
2016-01-19 04:28:28	Scruffy	I can even change the script for the cutscenes
2016-01-19 04:28:40	Neocraftz1553	really?
2016-01-19 04:28:44	Scruffy	They could say anything we want them to
2016-01-19 04:28:48	En_Passant	The treasure collected cutscenes?
2016-01-19 04:28:55	En_Passant	Or the game's cutscenes
2016-01-19 04:29:05	Scruffy	Both
2016-01-19 04:29:11	Scruffy	This is all the English text in the game
2016-01-19 04:29:14	En_Passant	I thought we knew that already
2016-01-19 04:29:15	Neocraftz1553	Change it so they say something funny, then post it on YT!
2016-01-19 04:29:26	Neocraftz1553	or... should we?
2016-01-19 04:29:27	Scruffy	the only thing we have to make sure of is that the line breaks stay the same, I guess
2016-01-19 04:30:43	En_Passant	Okay, I need to go shower. I'll be back later.
2016-01-19 04:31:10	Scruffy	Okay! We'll keep on trucking and update you when you're back
2016-01-19 04:31:21	Neocraftz1553	be back later as well
2016-01-19 04:31:30	Neocraftz1553	got some things to take care of
2016-01-19 04:31:44	@PikFan	see you guys
2016-01-19 04:31:48	Scruffy	No problem
2016-01-19 04:31:48	En_Passant	Make a Google doc?
2016-01-19 04:31:55	Scruffy	Yes, good thinking
2016-01-19 04:33:18	@PikFan	actually, I'll be leaving now too for a little while
2016-01-19 04:33:22	@PikFan	I got dinner
2016-01-19 04:33:35	@PikFan	I feel bad because now you're all by youself
2016-01-19 04:33:38	@PikFan	*yourself
2016-01-19 04:33:54	@PikFan	but yeah, I'll be back in a bit
2016-01-19 04:35:46	Scruffy	No big deal
2016-01-19 04:36:05	Scruffy	All right, when you guys get back, this Google Doc will be open for you to edit
2016-01-19 04:36:18	Scruffy	Remember to keep line breaks intact
2016-01-19 04:36:20	Neocraftz1553	Btw, the rock pikmins limbs look deformed xc
2016-01-19 04:36:27	Scruffy	Aww sorry
2016-01-19 04:37:08	Scruffy	What we should do actually is copy what we want to work on to a text document of our own, and test out our name before putting it back
2016-01-19 04:37:35	Scruffy	Although, it doesn't really matter since I'm putting it back on the bmg file anyway
2016-01-19 04:37:38	Scruffy	So yeah, hang on

2016-01-19 05:24:17	Scruffy	Yep

2016-01-19 05:24:23	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-19 05:24:37	En_Passant	Or should we suggest them first?
2016-01-19 05:24:58	Scruffy	ummm
2016-01-19 05:25:12	Scruffy	I suppose you don't have to
2016-01-19 05:25:16	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-19 05:25:18	Scruffy	But it'd be good to discuss them
2016-01-19 05:25:26	@PikFan	actually...
2016-01-19 05:25:32	Neocraftz1553	oh, scruffy

2016-01-19 05:26:53	@PikFan	stop! you're being Pikminist!
2016-01-19 05:26:53	Neocraftz1553	ty, scruffy

2016-01-19 05:27:48	@PikFan	oh, yeah, I saw it
2016-01-19 05:27:52	@PikFan	looks pretty cool!
2016-01-19 05:28:09	En_Passant	I agree, but why is a White Pikmin inside of a crystal?
2016-01-19 05:28:31	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-19 05:28:39	Neocraftz1553	just added it in for fun
2016-01-19 05:28:59	Scruffy	Useless Idol does not have the same amount of characters as Worthless Statue, sorry
2016-01-19 05:29:12	@PikFan	I thought you could pad it with spaces?
2016-01-19 05:29:18	Scruffy	OH shoot
2016-01-19 05:29:55	Scruffy	Okay, fixed, sorry about that
2016-01-19 05:30:11	En_Passant	Worthless Statue should be my treasure
2016-01-19 05:30:12	@PikFan	heh, it's ok
2016-01-19 05:30:27	En_Passant	Either that or Priceless Statue
2016-01-19 05:30:29	En_Passant	Because chess

2016-01-19 05:31:52	@PikFan	nan des ka
2016-01-19 05:33:07	En_Passant	EnPassant is nine character just like the two statues
2016-01-19 05:33:15	En_Passant	Though it doesn't have a space
2016-01-19 05:34:06	Scruffy	Joy Receptacle = Red Rider B.B. if anyone gets that reference
2016-01-19 05:34:14	@PikFan	no, sorry

2016-01-19 05:40:17	En_Passant	Will you be getting your license?
2016-01-19 05:40:20	@PikFan	no
2016-01-19 05:40:31	@PikFan	I have no motivation to drive yet
2016-01-19 05:41:17	@PikFan	if I wanted to, I could get it as early as July
2016-01-19 05:41:17	En_Passant	Really?
2016-01-19 05:41:36	En_Passant	Why not?
2016-01-19 05:41:42	@PikFan	I just... don't
2016-01-19 05:41:58	@PikFan	like, I see no need

2016-01-19 05:43:50	Scruffy	The motivation to drive will come
2016-01-19 05:43:59	Scruffy	Don't worry
2016-01-19 05:44:03	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2016-01-19 05:49:59	Scruffy	meat satchel = olimar mayer
2016-01-19 05:50:07	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-19 05:51:07	En_Passant	What should PikFan's treasure be
2016-01-19 05:51:19	Scruffy	Hmmm
2016-01-19 05:51:33	Scruffy	PikFan? Care to choose?
2016-01-19 05:51:55	@PikFan	not sure
2016-01-19 05:52:12	@PikFan	there's too many to pick from
2016-01-19 05:53:38	En_Passant	I have an idea for another bad one
2016-01-19 05:53:45	En_Passant	The Priceless Statue is a black queen
2016-01-19 05:53:51	En_Passant	so a black woman
2016-01-19 05:53:57	@PikFan	lol
2016-01-19 05:54:02	Scruffy	Wow
2016-01-19 05:54:18	Scruffy	Well... I did think of Insect Condo as Koppai Jesus
2016-01-19 05:54:24	Scruffy	So I guess I'm not that far off
2016-01-19 05:54:29	En_Passant	Oh, I know
2016-01-19 05:54:33	En_Passant	Independent Idol
2016-01-19 05:54:44	En_Passant	It don't need no man
2016-01-19 05:56:21	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-19 05:56:50	En_Passant	And maybe En Passant Mimic for Worthless Statue
2016-01-19 05:57:02	En_Passant	It's not a very good mimic, but it needs to be five characters
2016-01-19 05:57:40	Scruffy	That works
2016-01-19 05:58:41	En_Passant	King of Sweets --> CHOOOOCOLAAATE
2016-01-19 05:59:14	Scruffy	Had to line break it, but that makes it funnier
2016-01-19 06:00:11	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-19 06:00:25	En_Passant	it does
2016-01-19 06:04:28	En_Passant	does a line break count as a character?
2016-01-19 06:04:35	Scruffy	No
2016-01-19 06:06:38	En_Passant	Crystal King --> A Rock Pikmin
2016-01-19 06:06:59	En_Passant	Kinda eh, but it looks nearly identical to the big crystal hazards from 3
2016-01-19 06:07:19	Scruffy	True
2016-01-19 06:07:57	Scruffy	A Rock Pikmin is actually one too long
2016-01-19 06:08:25	En_Passant	Not if line breaks don't count

2016-01-19 06:08:34	Scruffy	Oh, heh, right
2016-01-19 06:08:38	En_Passant	That makes it A RockPikmin
2016-01-19 06:08:39	Scruffy	forgot
2016-01-19 06:09:22	En_Passant	That means some others can be made longer, too
2016-01-19 06:09:35	@PikFan	Time Capsule → Voyager 1
2016-01-19 06:10:01	Scruffy	Nice
2016-01-19 06:10:16	En_Passant	I don't get it
2016-01-19 06:10:39	@PikFan	the Golden Record on Voyager 1?
2016-01-19 06:10:46	@PikFan	in a way, it's like a time capsule
2016-01-19 06:11:11	@PikFan	eh, my logic is flawed
2016-01-19 06:13:02	En_Passant	Arboreal Frippery --> Smoke Lotsa Weed
2016-01-19 06:13:09	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-19 06:13:17	@PikFan	lol
2016-01-19 06:13:28	Scruffy	I always thought they got Frippery from Robert Fripp because it looked like hemp
2016-01-19 06:13:45	En_Passant	Hemp and pot are the same plant
2016-01-19 06:13:49	Scruffy	And I thought that's a little over Pikmin kids' heads but okay
2016-01-19 06:13:57	Scruffy	Yeah, I know
2016-01-19 06:14:05	En_Passant	Hey, in the Japanese version it was implied to be weed
2016-01-19 06:14:10	Scruffy	Heh yeah
2016-01-19 06:14:21	@PikFan	because of Olimar's notes, right?
2016-01-19 06:14:29	@PikFan	doesn't he call it an amazing drug or something
2016-01-19 06:14:56	En_Passant	both the notes and the sales pitch call it the "ultimate drug" according to the site
2016-01-19 06:14:59	Scruffy	Onion Replica = in-law Pikmin
2016-01-19 06:15:16	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2016-01-19 06:15:23	En_Passant	Pikmin In-Law
2016-01-19 06:15:32	En_Passant	it goes at the end
2016-01-19 06:15:45	Scruffy	Even better
2016-01-19 06:19:22	En_Passant	Growshroom --> Mario Bros
2016-01-19 06:19:49	Scruffy	Hehe yep
2016-01-19 06:27:56	Scruffy	Brute Knuckles = Falcon Punch 
2016-01-19 06:28:25	En_Passant	A bit short, but cool
2016-01-19 06:28:42	Scruffy	Yeah, I wanna try and minimize my names that need padding
2016-01-19 06:28:51	Scruffy	Sort of the fun challenge of it

2016-01-19 06:35:17	Scruffy	Yeah, it's rushed
2016-01-19 06:35:28	@PikFan	Scruffy, you should post this on the forums
2016-01-19 06:35:37	@PikFan	not the link, I mean
2016-01-19 06:35:45	Scruffy	Just the idea?
2016-01-19 06:35:49	@PikFan	but about the whole Pikmin 2 night mode
2016-01-19 06:35:53	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 06:36:07	@PikFan	and you can ask for help for renaming the treasures
2016-01-19 06:36:08	Scruffy	I feel like the text is an even bigger undertaking in itself
2016-01-19 06:36:28	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 06:36:39	Scruffy	But not the link, that'd be a little chaotic
2016-01-19 06:36:57	En_Passant	Especially because then they'd all want treasures named after them, too
2016-01-19 06:37:02	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-19 06:38:22	Scruffy	Remembered Old Buddy = Crotchety Old Geezer

2016-01-19 19:23:48	Yoshi2	hi Scruffy 
2016-01-19 19:24:17	@Espyo	so I actually managed to make some sense out of the plotted objects and carrying paths
2016-01-19 19:24:20	@Espyo	they make total sense after all
2016-01-19 19:24:26	Scruffy	Really?
2016-01-19 19:24:29	@Espyo	and I THINK I see the out-of-bounds Spectralid
2016-01-19 19:24:45	@Espyo	thing is, I left what I made at work, so I can't really show anything here :|
2016-01-19 19:24:49	Scruffy	Okay, is singular Spectralid or Spectralids?
2016-01-19 19:24:57	@Espyo	Spectralid, from what I can tell
2016-01-19 19:25:02	Scruffy	I feel like it's actually Spectralids
2016-01-19 19:25:07	Kazooie	it's
2016-01-19 19:25:12	Scruffy	All of the Piklopedia and lock-on names are singular
2016-01-19 19:25:14	Kazooie	Spectralid
2016-01-19 19:25:17	@Espyo	wait, are you asking if there's one or multiple Flitterbies out-of-bounds, or are you asking about how they're called?
2016-01-19 19:25:24	Kazooie	why would it be Spectralids
2016-01-19 19:25:27	Scruffy	How they are called
2016-01-19 19:25:34	Yoshi2	the reason why I didn't notice my parser was incomplete is that I made an incorrect assumption about one of the values being a section count
2016-01-19 19:25:35	@Espyo	[[Flitterby family#Naming]] this is the consensus

2016-01-19 19:25:51	@Espyo	right
2016-01-19 19:25:55	@Espyo	also, in the process, I learned a lot about Python

2016-01-19 19:26:06	Yoshi2	yay

2016-01-19 19:27:30	Scruffy	<Kazooie>: why would it be Spectralids
2016-01-19 19:27:39	Scruffy	I was thinking "lids" refers to its wings

2016-01-19 19:39:45	@Espyo	http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/01/19/subject-urgent-warning/ amazing
2016-01-19 19:43:13	Scruffy	Oh, I suppose I might as well invite anyone who wants to help
2016-01-19 19:43:48	Scruffy	Yesterday I was looking in the Pikmin 2 English text to replace the ship's dialogues to reflect gameplay at night
2016-01-19 19:44:12	Scruffy	And was convinced with help by other users here to make the mod I'm making a full parody of Pikmin 2
2016-01-19 19:44:44	Scruffy	So if anyone would like to help rename treasures, I can send the Google Doc link
2016-01-19 19:50:39	@Espyo	parody eh?
2016-01-19 19:50:56	@Espyo	so give the treasures whole new names, that are still funny and fit the Pikmin theme?
2016-01-19 19:51:11	Scruffy	well... it was 1 in the morning for me and late for others
2016-01-19 19:51:14	@Espyo	also, unless reality changed, replacing strings in Pikmin 2 has to be done with strings of the same size
2016-01-19 19:51:17	Scruffy	not all of them fit the pikmin thing
2016-01-19 19:51:23	Scruffy	We know
2016-01-19 19:51:25	Scruffy	We have that rule
2016-01-19 19:51:26	@Espyo	so what's the actual goal?
2016-01-19 19:51:38	Scruffy	Same number of characters and include line breaks if one already exists
2016-01-19 19:51:54	Scruffy	The goal is still to collect 10000 pokos and raise Pikmin
2016-01-19 19:52:15	@Espyo	I meant more like the goal in renaming the treasures
2016-01-19 19:52:19	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-19 19:52:27	Scruffy	We just got excited that we could and that it worked
2016-01-19 19:53:19	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-19 19:53:40	Scruffy	It doesn't have to be a full parody, but it certainly was plenty of jokes told
2016-01-19 19:53:50	Scruffy	All with equal characters to the canonical names
2016-01-19 19:54:01	@Espyo	right
2016-01-19 19:55:07	Scruffy	I know if I tried I could still think of new names for all the treasures that are the same length
2016-01-19 19:55:13	Scruffy	That still fit the theme
2016-01-19 19:55:23	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-19 19:58:40	Scruffy	But for now I'm just changing the ship's messages so they make sense playing at night

2016-01-19 21:16:37	Yoshi2	Espyo: it really helps that a lot of these difficult parts of the file have a few bytes at the start which specify the length
2016-01-19 21:17:09	Yoshi2	but for some reason, the endianness is different this time
2016-01-19 21:28:04	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2016-01-19 21:29:55	Yoshi2	I also have an easy way to remember "least significant bit" and "most significant bit" now
2016-01-19 21:30:11	Yoshi2	least significant bit = the bit which affests the value of the number the least
2016-01-19 21:30:26	@Espyo	yeah, that's what it's meant to be
2016-01-19 21:30:27	Yoshi2	most significant bit = the bit which affests the value the most

2016-01-19 21:35:43	Yoshi2	yup, it's not different, my mind just played tricks on me

2016-01-20 00:19:39	Scruffy	Indifferent
2016-01-20 00:19:45	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-20 00:19:54	@PikFan	well, that's too bad
2016-01-20 00:20:11	@PikFan	I really thought he'd get a kick out of them
2016-01-20 00:20:33	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-20 00:20:34	Scruffy	Wait
2016-01-20 00:20:39	@PikFan	?

2016-01-20 00:20:43	Scruffy	I was going to

2016-01-20 00:20:59	Scruffy	I forgot to link Espyo to the article
2016-01-20 00:21:05	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-20 00:21:08	Scruffy	I was telling him about it, but I had to head out at the time
2016-01-20 00:21:19	Scruffy	So I must have forgotten
2016-01-20 00:21:25	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-20 00:21:32	Scruffy	I can do it tomorrow, there weren't that many names ready anyway
2016-01-20 00:21:41	@PikFan	well, it's okay, you can—yeah
2016-01-20 00:21:43	Scruffy	But I did add a few more today

2016-01-20 00:26:44	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-20 00:27:05	@PikFan	so last night I went poking around the Music article
2016-01-20 00:27:22	Scruffy	Mhm?
2016-01-20 00:27:39	@PikFan	I remember that before you revamped it, there was a section dedicated to the different variations
2016-01-20 00:27:49	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 00:28:08	@PikFan	how come you got rid of it?

2016-01-20 00:29:40	Scruffy	That's why the "areas" sections of the music articles have their own info on variations
2016-01-20 00:29:59	Scruffy	It was too different per game to keep in one overarching article
2016-01-20 00:30:21	Scruffy	But I do introduce the concept in the "Music" article
2016-01-20 00:30:45	@PikFan	I feel like they're still noteworthy
2016-01-20 00:31:02	Scruffy	What's still noteworthy?
2016-01-20 00:31:20	@PikFan	I mean, I know the variations are described for each individual theme, but...
2016-01-20 00:31:24	Scruffy	hold on fire alarms
2016-01-20 00:31:38	@PikFan	woah ok

2016-01-20 00:57:24	Scruffy	I'm back
2016-01-20 00:57:34	Scruffy	It was an actual fire, but no one got hurt
2016-01-20 00:58:03	@PikFan	wow
2016-01-20 00:58:08	@PikFan	that's good
2016-01-20 00:58:18	@PikFan	how big was the fire?
2016-01-20 01:00:10	Scruffy	I might type a little slower though because my hands are freezing from standing in the street for 20 minutes
2016-01-20 01:00:11	Scruffy	Not very big, if it took 20 minutes to deal iwth
2016-01-20 01:00:11	Scruffy	I'd say it didn't even cover 1 room
2016-01-20 01:00:11	Scruffy	it was probably incorrect microwaving or something
2016-01-20 01:00:58	Scruffy	Anyway, what did you mean about the music articles?
2016-01-20 01:01:06	@PikFan	well, that's good
2016-01-20 01:01:16	@PikFan	at least nobody was hurt
2016-01-20 01:01:21	Scruffy	Definitely
2016-01-20 01:01:27	Scruffy	Our dorm has good response to fire
2016-01-20 01:01:34	@PikFan	hope they can repair the damages soon
2016-01-20 01:01:39	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 01:01:51	Scruffy	I don't think it was that serious of damages either
2016-01-20 01:02:01	@PikFan	that's good
2016-01-20 01:02:16	@PikFan	well, all's well that ends well
2016-01-20 01:02:23	Scruffy	Yep
2016-01-20 01:03:54	@PikFan	anyway, so I was suggesting that on each music article for the games, you could have a section called Variations, explaining what types of variations are present, what triggers them, etc
2016-01-20 01:04:14	Scruffy	I already do that
2016-01-20 01:04:25	Scruffy	[[Music in Pikmin 2#Areas]]
2016-01-20 01:04:32	Scruffy	oh
2016-01-20 01:04:55	Scruffy	well, if you go to the areas section, at the beginning, I have a part describing the general variations and what triggers them
2016-01-20 01:05:03	Scruffy	I do that for each game
2016-01-20 01:05:15	Scruffy	Even Pikmin Adventure
2016-01-20 01:05:31	@PikFan	ohhhh, duh
2016-01-20 01:05:43	@PikFan	I see it
2016-01-20 01:05:51	@PikFan	derp, I'm dumb
2016-01-20 01:05:56	Scruffy	Hehe that's okay
2016-01-20 01:06:05	Scruffy	I was worried there for a second
2016-01-20 01:06:27	Scruffy	No, when I made the music articles I wanted to make sure to retain all the info we already had, just improve on it as well
2016-01-20 01:07:04	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-20 01:07:59	@PikFan	well, some days ago En Passant was complaining that there isn't enough Pikmin extended music tracks
2016-01-20 01:08:30	@PikFan	even the existing music videos don't cover all the possible combinations
2016-01-20 01:08:51	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 01:09:15	@PikFan	so I was thinking, when I finally get the right equipment, I can make my own extended music videos for everyone to enjoy
2016-01-20 01:09:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 01:09:50	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-01-20 01:09:55	Scruffy	Do you have Dolphin?

2016-01-20 01:10:28	@PikFan	I don't even have a computer of my own...
2016-01-20 01:10:31	Scruffy	Sorry, never mind
2016-01-20 01:10:37	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-20 01:10:54	@PikFan	I'd be able to do loads more if I had my own
2016-01-20 01:11:01	@PikFan	but alas, I don't

2016-01-20 01:17:26	Scruffy	If you send me drawings, I could send you renders?
2016-01-20 01:18:49	@PikFan	uhm
2016-01-20 01:18:55	@PikFan	possibly
2016-01-20 01:21:26	Scruffy	Like we did with the Torrid Desert
2016-01-20 01:22:08	@PikFan	sure
2016-01-20 01:22:29	@PikFan	but I hardly produce drawings of that high quality
2016-01-20 01:22:46	@PikFan	I...don't know what came over me that night
2016-01-20 01:22:55	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-20 01:22:59	@PikFan	I just suddenly wanted to draw
2016-01-20 01:23:31	@PikFan	and I found myself doing it in meticulous detail, instead of some simple sketch
2016-01-20 01:23:47	@PikFan	I worked at it for a good couple of hours
2016-01-20 01:23:59	Scruffy	Nice

2016-01-20 02:44:04	Neocraftz1553	like the purple and the red pikmin in cycles?
2016-01-20 02:44:35	Scruffy	A node called Mix Shader can do the job
2016-01-20 02:44:47	Neocraftz1553	heh, I know
2016-01-20 02:45:07	Neocraftz1553	but Diffuse + Glossy don't come out very well
2016-01-20 02:45:08	Scruffy	Mix the Pikmin's shader with a glossy shader
2016-01-20 02:45:12	Scruffy	How come?
2016-01-20 02:45:30	Neocraftz1553	They reflect everything else
2016-01-20 02:45:53	Scruffy	Ah, that may be because of the "roughness" setting on the glossy shader
2016-01-20 02:45:59	Scruffy	If you bump it up to .1 or .2
2016-01-20 02:46:09	Scruffy	That might help
2016-01-20 02:46:34	Neocraftz1553	ok, let me try
2016-01-20 02:47:00	Scruffy	"Roughness" simulates tiny imperfections on glossy surfaces that make them scatter light in different directions rather than being a perfect mirroe
2016-01-20 02:47:04	Scruffy	mirror*
2016-01-20 02:47:23	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-01-20 02:47:35	Neocraftz1553	leik marbulls
2016-01-20 02:47:59	Neocraftz1553	ahh, thats much, much better
2016-01-20 02:48:08	Scruffy	Yay
2016-01-20 02:48:18	Neocraftz1553	when you do it, start at .2
2016-01-20 02:48:35	Scruffy	Then just mess around with the color of the diffuse and glossy to get interesting looks
2016-01-20 02:48:52	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-20 02:49:17	Neocraftz1553	I am currently modeling a Purple Pikmin for Pikmin Return and the community fangame
2016-01-20 02:49:23	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-01-20 02:49:25	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-01-20 02:49:46	Neocraftz1553	heh, and I noticed a little thing on your Purple Pikmin render
2016-01-20 02:50:09	Neocraftz1553	it is in the same position it is when you just import the .obj
2016-01-20 02:50:23	Neocraftz1553	no offense or anything, I just noticed that
2016-01-20 02:50:41	Scruffy	Yeah, I was pretty much still starting out on Blender
2016-01-20 02:50:52	Neocraftz1553	ooooh
2016-01-20 02:50:58	Neocraftz1553	It still came out good
2016-01-20 02:51:01	Scruffy	Pikmin Fanon has given me a LOT of Blender experience
2016-01-20 02:51:08	Neocraftz1553	yes, me too
2016-01-20 02:51:15	Neocraftz1553	thanks mostly to you
2016-01-20 02:51:28	Scruffy	I'm honored
2016-01-20 02:51:30	-->	En_Passant (Mibbit@713.sub-72-619-6.myvzw.com) has joined #pikipedia
2016-01-20 02:52:40	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-20 02:52:59	En_Passant	Thinking of funny names?
2016-01-20 02:53:14	Scruffy	Hey En_Passant
2016-01-20 02:53:18	Scruffy	I've added a few more
2016-01-20 02:53:21	Neocraftz1553	nah, just honoring scruffy for being my teacher for blender :P
2016-01-20 02:53:32	Scruffy	But I've taken a break to change some text in the ship's dialogue
2016-01-20 02:53:37	Neocraftz1553	I couldnt get in on my computer
2016-01-20 02:53:38	Scruffy	I'll show you the new ones
2016-01-20 02:54:02	Scruffy	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2Vn4Yl2KuYJ10drzewND6Kzc7xp8gPdAcmbRkhnoUY/edit
2016-01-20 02:54:16	En_Passant	I'm on my phone at work
2016-01-20 02:54:20	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-20 02:54:29	En_Passant	But I checked earlier today
2016-01-20 02:54:32	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-20 02:55:41	En_Passant	I thought of a better name for Crystal King
2016-01-20 02:55:46	Scruffy	I also need to keep a log of what I change
2016-01-20 02:55:46	Scruffy	I think I'll make that on Pikmin Fanon
2016-01-20 02:56:10	En_Passant	For the ship?
2016-01-20 02:56:26	Neocraftz1553	nice P1 reference
2016-01-20 02:56:33	Neocraftz1553	Gravity Flumper
2016-01-20 02:56:45	Scruffy	Thanks
2016-01-20 02:56:57	Scruffy	Crystal King = For the Ship?
2016-01-20 02:57:28	En_Passant	I was going for Rock Hazard
2016-01-20 02:57:44	Scruffy	Oh oh I see now
2016-01-20 02:57:49	Scruffy	Yes, I like that
2016-01-20 02:58:05	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-20 02:58:32	Scruffy	And, about the log on Fanon, I would just use it for general changes, and keeping track of how enemies and objects are different
2016-01-20 02:59:04	En_Passant	You want to reveal that much already?
2016-01-20 02:59:09	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-01-20 02:59:11	Scruffy	Good point
2016-01-20 02:59:15	Scruffy	Never mind
2016-01-20 02:59:22	Scruffy	I'll just keep my personal log
2016-01-20 02:59:32	Neocraftz1553	ok, I reviewed the link
2016-01-20 02:59:40	Neocraftz1553	I wrote it down on my computer
2016-01-20 02:59:44	Scruffy	But I love adding little jokes to the ship's dialogues
2016-01-20 02:59:50	Neocraftz1553	I missed the 6 in ND6K
2016-01-20 02:59:54	Scruffy	It's very silly
2016-01-20 03:00:04	Neocraftz1553	heh, can't wait
2016-01-20 03:00:41	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-20 03:00:52	Neocraftz1553	I'm editing the Purple Pikmins Model
2016-01-20 03:01:12	Neocraftz1553	Its "hairs" look like toothpicks in its head
2016-01-20 03:01:46	Scruffy	Mhm
2016-01-20 03:01:57	Neocraftz1553	in fact you can take them out
2016-01-20 03:03:20	En_Passant	Speaking of modeling, I'm having relatively little luck with Maya
2016-01-20 03:03:26	Scruffy	Oh no!
2016-01-20 03:03:54	Scruffy	I could send you a reference model of Olimar if that would help
2016-01-20 03:04:03	En_Passant	That would
2016-01-20 03:04:28	En_Passant	I'm trying to figure out the steps to actually make the model, though
2016-01-20 03:05:08	Scruffy	yeah
2016-01-20 03:05:20	En_Passant	The tutorials, much like with coding, teach about an example, not through one
2016-01-20 03:05:41	Neocraftz1553	what are you making En_Passant?
2016-01-20 03:06:15	En_Passant	I'm making a model of Olimar from scratch
2016-01-20 03:06:37	Neocraftz1553	oh, that seems hard
2016-01-20 03:06:40	En_Passant	Because I've never modeled before and I want to say I did it
2016-01-20 03:06:52	En_Passant	It's post of a project
2016-01-20 03:06:59	En_Passant	*part
2016-01-20 03:07:26	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-20 03:08:23	Neocraftz1553	woo hoo
2016-01-20 03:08:43	Neocraftz1553	I just put the purple pikmins hand down successfully
2016-01-20 03:09:18	En_Passant	From the T-pose?
2016-01-20 03:09:27	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-01-20 03:09:39	En_Passant	Down from where?
2016-01-20 03:09:52	Neocraftz1553	It was holding it up
2016-01-20 03:09:58	Neocraftz1553	so I put it down :P
2016-01-20 03:10:16	En_Passant	Up up, or out up?
2016-01-20 03:10:22	Neocraftz1553	I usually have to do it a few times before it looks natural
2016-01-20 03:10:50	Neocraftz1553	I have no idea what your talking about
2016-01-20 03:10:53	Neocraftz1553	sorry
2016-01-20 03:11:02	Scruffy	okay En_Passant, I have a link to a reference model and textures of Captain Olimar
2016-01-20 03:11:40	En_Passant	I'd send it in an e-mail out put it on my talk page
2016-01-20 03:11:53	En_Passant	*or
2016-01-20 03:12:28	En_Passant	Swipe type isn't the most reliable
2016-01-20 03:12:35	Scruffy	can you access it in a new tab on your phone, or would you prefer to see it later?
2016-01-20 03:12:44	Scruffy	Okay
2016-01-20 03:12:45	En_Passant	Later
2016-01-20 03:12:50	Scruffy	I'll email it to you
2016-01-20 03:12:54	Scruffy	Bye
2016-01-20 03:13:01	En_Passant	I have to leave in a minute
2016-01-20 03:13:06	Scruffy	Ah okay
2016-01-20 03:13:14	Scruffy	See ya later
2016-01-20 03:13:18	Neocraftz1553	cya
2016-01-20 03:13:26	En_Passant	See ya
2016-01-20 03:13:34	<--	En_Passant (Mibbit@713.sub-72-619-6.myvzw.com) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-01-20 03:13:36	Neocraftz1553	I am alone now
2016-01-20 03:13:39	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-20 03:14:12	Scruffy	I'm still here
2016-01-20 03:14:22	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-01-20 03:14:26	Neocraftz1553	good
2016-01-20 03:18:54	Neocraftz1553	I'm just about finished with the Purple Pikmin
2016-01-20 03:19:01	Scruffy	Yay!
2016-01-20 03:19:17	Neocraftz1553	want to see it?
2016-01-20 03:19:33	Scruffy	I mean once you're finished
2016-01-20 03:19:34	Neocraftz1553	I could even send you the model if you want
2016-01-20 03:19:42	Scruffy	Oh, sure!
2016-01-20 03:19:51	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I just need to re-position its belly
2016-01-20 03:20:05	Scruffy	Well, could you send me the model once you've set up your materials?
2016-01-20 03:20:17	Scruffy	Maybe I could give you some pointers on making materials as well
2016-01-20 03:21:10	Scruffy	Then you could send me the .blend file
2016-01-20 03:21:41	Scruffy	All you would have to do to prepare it would be to select the UV/Image Editor instead of 3D view
2016-01-20 03:22:47	Scruffy	And from the menu select each image that's used in the scene and select Image>Pack Image
2016-01-20 03:23:02	Scruffy	And then everything about the file would be all packed into the file
2016-01-20 03:23:11	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:24:00	Neocraftz1553	materials? Like the Purple on the pikmin and such?
2016-01-20 03:24:21	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-20 03:24:31	Scruffy	If that's not images, then you don't have to worry about it
2016-01-20 03:24:52	Scruffy	But like, do the Purple Pikmin eyes have a special texture?
2016-01-20 03:25:35	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-01-20 03:25:43	Neocraftz1553	I did it all "manually"
2016-01-20 03:25:51	Neocraftz1553	without the use of textures
2016-01-20 03:25:53	Scruffy	Ah okay, great!
2016-01-20 03:25:59	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-20 03:26:03	Scruffy	Then yeah, just send me the blend file
2016-01-20 03:26:16	Neocraftz1553	I do not know how to use textures yet...
2016-01-20 03:26:17	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:26:25	Scruffy	i can teach you texturing
2016-01-20 03:27:36	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:27:43	Neocraftz1553	thanks in advance
2016-01-20 03:27:59	Neocraftz1553	ok, so do I send you the .blend1 file too?
2016-01-20 03:28:10	Scruffy	Ummmm
2016-01-20 03:28:14	Neocraftz1553	or just the .blend file?
2016-01-20 03:28:14	Scruffy	I'm not sure
2016-01-20 03:28:23	Scruffy	I don't know what the .blend1 does
2016-01-20 03:28:24	Neocraftz1553	Ill send them both just in case
2016-01-20 03:28:30	Scruffy	It might just be a backup
2016-01-20 03:28:46	Neocraftz1553	or a temporary file
2016-01-20 03:28:59	Neocraftz1553	like cache
2016-01-20 03:31:54	Neocraftz1553	alright here it is
2016-01-20 03:31:58	Neocraftz1553	http://www.mediafire.com/?1dc1ee5ky04lycn
2016-01-20 03:32:06	Neocraftz1553	tell me if it works
2016-01-20 03:32:25	Neocraftz1553	the filw is also zipped so youll have to unzip it
2016-01-20 03:32:34	Scruffy	Worked perfectly
2016-01-20 03:32:46	Scruffy	Don't worry, I have a rar unzipper
2016-01-20 03:33:23	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:34:19	Neocraftz1553	it will also have a failed rock pikmin along with the purple pikmin
2016-01-20 03:36:22	Scruffy	Nice job on all of that
2016-01-20 03:37:12	Scruffy	Now, one thing you can keep in mind
2016-01-20 03:37:45	Scruffy	When you went into edit mode on the purple pikmin, did you notice some lines were blue?
2016-01-20 03:37:57	Neocraftz1553	yes, I did
2016-01-20 03:38:07	Neocraftz1553	what are they for?
2016-01-20 03:39:31	Scruffy	Good
2016-01-20 03:39:31	Scruffy	Those are called "Sharp edges"
2016-01-20 03:39:31	Scruffy	On any model you can mark them
2016-01-20 03:39:31	Scruffy	In case you need to make some smooth object look like it has a crease, for example
2016-01-20 03:39:40	Scruffy	Or mix smooth and flat looking surfaces
2016-01-20 03:39:40	Neocraftz1553	oooh, ok
2016-01-20 03:39:57	Scruffy	But on this model, they aren't necessary, a Purple Pikmin should be completely smooth
2016-01-20 03:40:09	Scruffy	Oh oh oh 
2016-01-20 03:40:20	Scruffy	One more thing sharp edges are useful for
2016-01-20 03:40:30	Neocraftz1553	yes?
2016-01-20 03:41:06	Scruffy	I believe there is also an option like this called "creased edges"
2016-01-20 03:41:33	Scruffy	But both creased and sharp edges define /2D projection/ edges of the model
2016-01-20 03:41:53	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-01-20 03:42:13	Scruffy	Like if this were a paper 3D shape and you wanted to cut it out into 2D shapes
2016-01-20 03:42:24	Scruffy	Or at least into manageable pieces
2016-01-20 03:42:40	Scruffy	These are essentially the dotted edges you'd use
2016-01-20 03:42:48	Scruffy	But sharp edges just happen to look sharp
2016-01-20 03:42:54	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see
2016-01-20 03:43:25	Scruffy	And that's very useful when you want to map a 2D image texture onto a 3D shape
2016-01-20 03:43:56	Scruffy	But anyway, for now, a Purple Pikmin is just a solid color, so there's no need for mapping
2016-01-20 03:44:10	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-20 03:44:14	Scruffy	So you can actually get rid of those sharp edges
2016-01-20 03:44:24	Neocraftz1553	how?
2016-01-20 03:44:34	Scruffy	In Edit Mode, you select the menu at the bottom called "Mesh"
2016-01-20 03:45:04	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-01-20 03:45:05	Scruffy	Wait, first select all the faces on the Purple PIkmin
2016-01-20 03:45:23	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:45:26	Scruffy	you can toggle selecting everything with "A"
2016-01-20 03:45:50	Neocraftz1553	clear sharp?
2016-01-20 03:45:54	Scruffy	Yep
2016-01-20 03:45:57	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:46:23	Scruffy	Now one more thing
2016-01-20 03:46:36	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:46:45	Scruffy	With that done, in the side menu, select "Remove Doubles"
2016-01-20 03:47:03	Scruffy	And it'll have no more sharp creased edges
2016-01-20 03:47:46	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:47:47	Neocraftz1553	done
2016-01-20 03:48:01	Scruffy	"Remove Doubles" makes all vertices, edges, and faces that are occupying the same space into one
2016-01-20 03:48:22	Neocraftz1553	ok, let me just do it to a red pikmin
2016-01-20 03:48:28	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 03:48:46	Neocraftz1553	done
2016-01-20 03:48:51	Neocraftz1553	thanks for the tip
2016-01-20 03:49:03	Scruffy	And then when you look at it in preview, it won't have a crease line on the side of its head and body
2016-01-20 03:49:08	Scruffy	Now, removing doubles is not always what you want
2016-01-20 03:49:25	Scruffy	Sometimes it can mess up what polygons are moved in a skeleton
2016-01-20 03:49:34	Scruffy	But usually it can smooth up your model
2016-01-20 03:49:42	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 03:50:30	Scruffy	Now one more thing
2016-01-20 03:51:30	Scruffy	In preview mode, you can sort of see the individual squares of the Purple Pikmin model when they aren't lit by the sun lamp
2016-01-20 03:51:50	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-20 03:52:00	Scruffy	To fix this, you can actually change the sun lamp
2016-01-20 03:52:33	Neocraftz1553	how?
2016-01-20 03:53:05	Scruffy	Select the sun lamp, then go to its special settings
2016-01-20 03:53:15	Scruffy	It should be an icon of a sum
2016-01-20 03:53:18	Scruffy	sun*
2016-01-20 03:53:34	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-20 03:55:30	Scruffy	Size is the relative size of shadows
2016-01-20 03:55:30	Scruffy	Or, how much light can scatter behind shadows
2016-01-20 03:55:30	Scruffy	Increasing it from .1 should soften those shadows on the Purple Pikmin
2016-01-20 03:55:30	Scruffy	If you put a floor underneath the Purple Pikmin you'll really be able to see the difference
2016-01-20 03:56:01	Scruffy	Now you may notice that doing this seems to decrease the shininess of the Purple Pikmin, since more light is scattering
2016-01-20 03:56:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-20 03:56:56	Scruffy	If you want that shininess back, you can look at your nodes and mix in a little more glossy shader in the "Factor" setting of the mix shader
2016-01-20 03:57:20	Neocraftz1553	oooh, yes
2016-01-20 03:57:40	Neocraftz1553	heh, check the nodes
2016-01-20 03:57:52	Neocraftz1553	there are tons of em
2016-01-20 03:57:57	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 03:58:13	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I mix them up to get my desired effects
2016-01-20 03:58:21	Scruffy	By the way, making the glossy shader just a little more purple would help, I think
2016-01-20 03:58:33	Scruffy	Like, a light almost white pink
2016-01-20 03:59:06	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-01-20 03:59:19	Neocraftz1553	waut, brb

2016-01-20 04:07:15	Neocraftz1553	Alright, I am back
2016-01-20 04:07:23	Scruffy	Hey
2016-01-20 04:07:36	Neocraftz1553	I just posted the Purple Pikmin render and added it to thw community fangame
2016-01-20 04:09:18	Scruffy	Well done!
2016-01-20 04:09:41	Scruffy	One last suggestion for future renders, and you have done this with others
2016-01-20 04:09:48	Neocraftz1553	yes:
2016-01-20 04:09:58	Neocraftz1553	*yes?
2016-01-20 04:10:25	Scruffy	It's good to light something with multiple different lights
2016-01-20 04:10:35	Neocraftz1553	yes, I have done this
2016-01-20 04:10:42	Scruffy	I don't know if you've ever heard of things like main light, key light, fill ilght
2016-01-20 04:10:47	Neocraftz1553	But I dont know how to use it wuth small objects
2016-01-20 04:10:55	Neocraftz1553	no I have not
2016-01-20 04:11:08	Neocraftz1553	Small objects being Pikmin and such
2016-01-20 04:11:23	Scruffy	Small objects?
2016-01-20 04:11:27	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-20 04:11:41	Scruffy	Why would that be different from large objects/
2016-01-20 04:12:03	Neocraftz1553	sometimes the light "overlights" it and suc
2016-01-20 04:12:56	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-20 04:13:13	Scruffy	Well, the light intensity can be tweaked using the "Strength" option
2016-01-20 04:13:43	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-20 04:13:56	Scruffy	But you'll see that images get a lot more dynamic when lit with multiple lights of varying colors, shapes, intensities, and softnesses
2016-01-20 04:14:05	Scruffy	As in your Bulborb Larva image
2016-01-20 04:14:05	Neocraftz1553	I will now try to do it to the red pikmin
2016-01-20 04:14:10	Neocraftz1553	ah, yes
2016-01-20 04:14:12	Scruffy	Cool
2016-01-20 04:14:23	Scruffy	One formula that works well is called three-point lighting
2016-01-20 04:14:25	Neocraftz1553	I had an extreme burst of inspiration there
2016-01-20 04:14:37	Neocraftz1553	what is that?
2016-01-20 04:14:50	Scruffy	There are three lights
2016-01-20 04:14:55	Scruffy	1. Key light
2016-01-20 04:15:15	Neocraftz1553	Ah, Scruffy, an important question
2016-01-20 04:15:15	Scruffy	It shines directly on the face of the subject
2016-01-20 04:15:23	Scruffy	oh, yes?
2016-01-20 04:15:52	Neocraftz1553	For Pikmin Return, I want to use some of the mechanics that you used in Pikmin Forever, is that ok with you?
2016-01-20 04:16:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-20 04:16:15	Scruffy	Of course
2016-01-20 04:16:39	Neocraftz1553	thank you
2016-01-20 04:16:44	Scruffy	No problem
2016-01-20 04:17:13	Scruffy	Okay, so yeah, the key light is a sharper light that illuminates the face
2016-01-20 04:17:22	Scruffy	Generally the brightest of the three
2016-01-20 04:17:29	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-20 04:17:33	Scruffy	Then there's 2. fill light
2016-01-20 04:17:58	Scruffy	Fill light is softer and not as bright, but still faces the front
2016-01-20 04:18:15	Scruffy	at a different angle than the key though, like maybe more off to the side
2016-01-20 04:18:27	Neocraftz1553	Oh, ok, makes sense
2016-01-20 04:18:29	Scruffy	Its job is to balance out the contrast made by the key light
2016-01-20 04:18:39	Scruffy	And then 3. back light
2016-01-20 04:19:33	Scruffy	This light, hence the name, goes behind the subject
2016-01-20 04:19:33	Scruffy	And illuminates its back softly for more balancing
2016-01-20 04:19:45	Neocraftz1553	ok, let me try it
2016-01-20 04:20:25	Scruffy	Sure, just remember to keep them all not too sharp
2016-01-20 04:20:35	Scruffy	That really helps it look more real, less computer generated
2016-01-20 04:21:17	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks a lot for the tips
2016-01-20 04:21:25	Scruffy	No problem!
2016-01-20 04:21:32	Scruffy	Good timing too, I have to go
2016-01-20 04:21:39	Scruffy	I'll be on tomorrow
2016-01-20 04:22:04	Neocraftz1553	ok, cya
2016-01-20 04:22:09	Scruffy	Bye

2016-01-20 19:11:53	Testyo	either way, it must be hard to keep track of even two languages without mixing up colloquialisms and be sure to pay another 200 for the NEW 3DS THANK YOU NINTENDO

2016-01-20 19:15:18	ScruffyChat	Which were made for Konami's Beatmania in 1998
2016-01-20 19:15:22	ScruffyChat	97*
2016-01-20 19:15:58	ScruffyChat	Or at least, that's all the info I can find on bms
2016-01-20 19:16:06	Yoshi2	ScruffyChat: bms has its root with beatmania?
2016-01-20 19:16:17	ScruffyChat	I think
2016-01-20 19:16:30	ScruffyChat	The structure appears to be the same
2016-01-20 19:16:43	ScruffyChat	Although I can't really tell because I have no means of encoding it properly to see it
2016-01-20 19:17:28	Yoshi2	ScruffyChat: do you have a link that has that info?
2016-01-20 19:18:07	ScruffyChat	http://filext.com/file-extension/BMS
2016-01-20 19:18:16	ScruffyChat	Actually, it might be the second one
2016-01-20 19:18:21	ScruffyChat	I assumed they were the same
2016-01-20 19:21:24	Yoshi2	nope, definitely doesn't have its roots with beatmania because beatmania seems to use a text based format
2016-01-20 19:21:31	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-20 19:21:31	Yoshi2	while pikmin's bms is purely binary
2016-01-20 19:21:39	ScruffyChat	I see
2016-01-20 19:21:57	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-20 19:22:29	@Espyo	I was starting to get scared
2016-01-20 19:22:36	@Espyo	at that whole bms thing
2016-01-20 19:24:13	ScruffyChat	Heh, sorry, false alarm
2016-01-20 19:24:26	ScruffyChat	But it's no less impossible for me to study anything about htem
2016-01-20 19:28:08	Yoshi2	here somebody wrote a midi->bms converter: https://github.com/arookas/MIDItoBMS
2016-01-20 19:28:30	Yoshi2	and here is my attempt at a bms->midi converter: https://github.com/RenolY2/py-playBMS
2016-01-20 19:28:58	ScruffyChat	which one?
2016-01-20 19:29:08	ScruffyChat	bmsmodules?

2016-01-20 19:29:59	Yoshi2	pyBMS is the main function, but the parsers are in EventParsers

2016-01-20 19:31:25	ScruffyChat	ah
2016-01-20 19:32:28	Yoshi2	the file format is pretty nuts
2016-01-20 19:34:10	Yoshi2	I am attempting to read an image format from battalion wars and it doesn't really work
2016-01-20 19:34:25	Yoshi2	they probably use some sort of fancy compression that I don't get
2016-01-20 19:34:41	Yoshi2	this is the only image so far that looks anything like what it is supposed to represent: https://i.imgur.com/zDP5LLX.png
2016-01-20 19:38:52	@Espyo	that is so familiar
2016-01-20 19:38:59	@Espyo	I think I've seen it more than once
2016-01-20 19:39:10	@Espyo	people try to make decoders, and the final image ends up just like that
2016-01-20 19:39:22	@Espyo	wrong size, and kinda shaky with some stabs of color off
2016-01-20 19:40:15	Yoshi2	so annoying :/
2016-01-20 19:40:58	Yoshi2	I started poking through devkitpro for clues, seems it has some image stuff https://github.com/devkitPro/gamecube-tools/tree/master/gxtool
2016-01-20 19:43:00	Yoshi2	what doesn't make sense about this format is that the data size is half the pixel count
2016-01-20 19:43:25	Yoshi2	and when trying to parse it as RGBA, I end up with an image that is 4 times as small
2016-01-20 19:44:26	@J	that looks familiar
2016-01-20 19:44:30	@J	might be the same as bnr
2016-01-20 19:44:39	@J	the images encoded in bnr, I should say(?)
2016-01-20 19:45:09	@J	http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yagcd/yagcd/chap14.html#sec14.1 spec
2016-01-20 19:45:39	@J	https://github.com/ikn/gcedit/blob/master/gcedit/ext/gcutil.py#L368 my implementation
2016-01-20 19:48:31	@Espyo	<J> that looks familiar
2016-01-20 19:48:35	@Espyo	qed
2016-01-20 19:48:50	@Espyo	it might be an indexed image format
2016-01-20 19:49:42	@J	that alone wouldn't explain the dimensions, plus you'd probably notice the index in the file
2016-01-20 19:49:52	Yoshi2	J: I don't think it is bnr, my format is not RGB5A1 and lacks a magic word
2016-01-20 19:49:58	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-20 19:50:02	@J	there's clearly some block-based decoding going on, like BNR
2016-01-20 19:50:06	@J	*encoding
2016-01-20 19:50:13	Yoshi2	possible
2016-01-20 19:50:20	@J	and it does look like it could be 4x4
2016-01-20 19:50:59	@J	do you think those colours are correct?
2016-01-20 19:51:05	@J	if so, maybe you just need the block stuff
2016-01-20 19:52:39	Yoshi2	the way the files are stored in the archive, there is an TXET section that contains some data like dimensions, and then comes a PIM secion that has the raw image data without any headers
2016-01-20 19:52:52	Yoshi2	sometimes there are other sections in between too, I haven't checked those out yet
2016-01-20 19:53:56	Yoshi2	I definitely need to give the block thing a try
2016-01-20 20:01:01	Yoshi2	but first comes homework that I'm typing up in latex
2016-01-20 20:21:14	@Espyo	ok, so it looks like there's not just one Yellow Spectralid on that little ledge out of bounds
2016-01-20 20:21:20	@Espyo	there's also a White Spectralid pretty close to it
2016-01-20 20:21:25	@Espyo	on the other side of the pathway
2016-01-20 20:21:34	@Espyo	it's hard to understand the Y value
2016-01-20 20:21:57	@Espyo	but most groundborne enemies have it at 20
2016-01-20 20:22:05	@Espyo	which seems to be the most common ground height on the GoH
2016-01-20 20:22:12	@Espyo	heck, even a White Spectralid somewhere has a Y of 20
2016-01-20 20:22:21	@Espyo	and those two Spectralids out of bounds have a Y of like 200 something
2016-01-20 20:22:29	@Espyo	so... it's high up, but I can't tell HOW high up
2016-01-20 20:22:46	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-01-20 20:22:53	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: when you saw one of them, was it close to the leaves that make up the path, or was it so high that you can just BARELY see it with the Koppad?
2016-01-20 20:23:59	ScruffyChat	Umm, I saw it get pretty close to the leaves on the path
2016-01-20 20:24:07	ScruffyChat	But it never stayed there long
2016-01-20 20:24:29	@Espyo	did it go back up, then?
2016-01-20 20:24:35	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-20 20:24:44	@Espyo	very high up, or eh?
2016-01-20 20:24:51	ScruffyChat	Very high up
2016-01-20 20:24:59	@Espyo	woah, so it moves a LOT vertically, then?
2016-01-20 20:25:06	ScruffyChat	I remember wanting to go at it with Wingeds, but I never got to
2016-01-20 20:25:07	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-20 20:25:12	ScruffyChat	Much higher than a Pikmin could reach
2016-01-20 20:25:20	@Espyo	ok, I'll try again, then
2016-01-20 20:25:24	@Espyo	I mean... there's two of them
2016-01-20 20:25:30	@Espyo	they're not even THAT much inside the path
2016-01-20 20:25:36	@Espyo	one of them looks like it's even before the transition point
2016-01-20 20:25:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I've never seen the White Spectralid
2016-01-20 20:27:10	@Espyo	it's on 1.txt
2016-01-20 20:27:13	@Espyo	hell if I know what that means
2016-01-20 20:27:20	@Espyo	but I think that that's the file for objects that are there every day
2016-01-20 20:27:25	ScruffyChat	huh
2016-01-20 20:27:30	@Espyo	I still don't have it quite figured out
2016-01-20 20:27:46	ScruffyChat	So a White Spectralid in the GoH, possibly on the first day?
2016-01-20 20:28:15	@Espyo	no, the Yellow is on that 1.txt too
2016-01-20 20:28:40	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-20 20:31:18	@Espyo	checked as high as I could
2016-01-20 20:31:26	@Espyo	any higher than that, and it'd crack the spacesuit helmet
2016-01-20 20:31:55	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-20 20:32:12	@Espyo	it's like hunting for a sasquatch in GTA
2016-01-20 20:32:22	ScruffyChat	Nah, those spacesuits could handle a spaceship explosion and a several-mile drop
2016-01-20 20:32:24	@Espyo	I look and look and look
2016-01-20 20:32:29	@Espyo	guess so
2016-01-20 20:35:15	@Espyo	dammit, I can't find anything AT ALL
2016-01-20 20:35:26	@Espyo	not even a few ambiguous pixels moving about
2016-01-20 20:35:39	ScruffyChat	Maybe it only appears on certain days
2016-01-20 20:35:51	@Espyo	I hope not...
2016-01-20 20:35:56	@Espyo	let's look at these files again
2016-01-20 20:36:58	@Espyo	so, there's 1.txt, default.txt, p30.txt, p60.txt, p70.txt, p120.txt, p129.txt
2016-01-20 20:37:01	@Espyo	all of these have objects
2016-01-20 20:37:11	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-20 20:37:17	@Espyo	the Spectralids are on 1.txt
2016-01-20 20:37:26	@Espyo	I think the "p" ones might be specific objects for each "room"
2016-01-20 20:37:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-20 20:38:30	@Espyo	the GOH has 7 rooms counting the main room
2016-01-20 20:38:33	ScruffyChat	I feel like I don't see it every time I play, but it's been a while
2016-01-20 20:38:42	@Espyo	the corridor to the boss has no mobs, so I guess that one doesn't get a file
2016-01-20 20:39:00	ScruffyChat	Maybe based on its location the game has trouble deciding whether it should be in the room ornot
2016-01-20 20:39:41	@Espyo	boy, that'd be messed up
2016-01-20 20:39:47	@Espyo	I guess I can check if it teleported to the other room, though
2016-01-20 20:41:25	@Espyo	nope, nothing
2016-01-20 20:41:35	@Espyo	does P3 even HAVE a concept of "enemies that only appear on certain days"?
2016-01-20 20:41:40	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-20 20:41:46	ScruffyChat	With Pellet Posies at least
2016-01-20 20:41:59	ScruffyChat	And Burgeoning Spiderwort
2016-01-20 20:42:22	ScruffyChat	The first day you are in the Distant Tundra there's no Bearded Amprat next to the Drake
2016-01-20 20:42:30	ScruffyChat	The second day there, there is
2016-01-20 20:43:02	ScruffyChat	And in the Garden of Hope, the 5 pellet posy next to the Drake that can only be reached with Yellow Pikmin appears on day 5
2016-01-20 20:45:57	@Espyo	hmm, I'll try checking what the Pellet Posy says, thanks
2016-01-20 20:46:02	@Espyo	...if I can find which one that is
2016-01-20 20:46:08	@Espyo	once again, I left everything at work
2016-01-20 20:46:22	ScruffyChat	It ought to be in a flower pot right next to the crystal wall by the Drake
2016-01-20 20:46:32	@Espyo	yeah, I know the one
2016-01-20 20:47:00	@Espyo	well
2016-01-20 20:47:13	@Espyo	there's "birthday", "deadday" and "expireday" on the flags
2016-01-20 20:47:46	@Espyo	but all 5-Pellet Posies have those three parameters set to 0
2016-01-20 20:47:55	@Espyo	I don't think I've seen ANY mob with any of those params set to not 0
2016-01-20 20:48:09	ScruffyChat	Hm
2016-01-20 20:48:42	ScruffyChat	Maybe it makes a completely new Garden of Hope on different days
2016-01-20 20:49:22	@Espyo	yikes
2016-01-20 20:50:19	@Espyo	all birthdays on that 1.txt are "0"
2016-01-20 20:51:27	ScruffyChat	That should mean they appear by default on day 1
2016-01-20 20:51:41	ScruffyChat	Perhaps the 5 Pellet Posy has its own parameter that delays its growth
2016-01-20 20:51:59	@Espyo	maybe
2016-01-20 20:52:05	ScruffyChat	Pretty convoluted, but hey, it's classic Pikmin
2016-01-20 20:52:18	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2016-01-20 20:53:33	ScruffyChat	Meanwhile I'm still going through everything the Ship says
2016-01-20 20:53:43	@Espyo	there's a lot of it, huh
2016-01-20 20:54:15	ScruffyChat	Once I changed the "day" messages to night messages I realized there's doesn't have to be justification for any of my changes
2016-01-20 20:54:34	ScruffyChat	Plus anyone who sees it will have played Pikmin 2 before and generally know what the ship would say
2016-01-20 20:54:45	ScruffyChat	So I'm just having fun with all of it
2016-01-20 20:55:12	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-20 20:55:24	@Espyo	ok, there's no such thing as a birthday that isn't 0
2016-01-20 20:55:27	@Espyo	in the entirety of the files
2016-01-20 20:55:31	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-01-20 20:55:46	ScruffyChat	Wonder what happens if you change that
2016-01-20 20:55:54	ScruffyChat	Like with a boss
2016-01-20 20:56:01	@Espyo	or deadday, or expireday
2016-01-20 20:56:06	@Espyo	everything, everywhere, is 0
2016-01-20 20:56:19	@Espyo	well, I can change it, but I can't see the changes in-game
2016-01-20 20:56:20	ScruffyChat	You'd just show up and there'd be a sign saying "Not my birthday. Come back tomorrow."
2016-01-20 20:56:31	@Espyo	eh, maybe in a few months, when Cemu is more usable
2016-01-20 20:56:32	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-01-20 20:56:45	ScruffyChat	Ah, I see
2016-01-20 20:56:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah I heard it just recently got basic audio support
2016-01-20 20:57:02	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-20 20:57:54	@Espyo	there's also this "interval"
2016-01-20 20:58:03	@Espyo	probably meant to be used like the Goolix and Mamuta in P1
2016-01-20 20:58:08	@Espyo	I bet this is always 0 too
2016-01-20 20:58:12	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-20 20:58:24	@Espyo	oh, wait
2016-01-20 20:58:28	@Espyo	there are some non-zeros
2016-01-20 20:58:30	@Espyo	not a lot
2016-01-20 21:00:08	@Espyo	...looks like I was ignored
2016-01-20 21:00:13	ScruffyChat	When I make a game, I'm going to use parameters with very specific titles
2016-01-20 21:00:15	@Espyo	all this time I was searching on the GOH folder
2016-01-20 21:00:20	@Espyo	although I DID say "go up one folder"
2016-01-20 21:00:27	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-20 21:00:43	@Espyo	ok, so there's a Chappy with an interval of 3
2016-01-20 21:00:52	@Espyo	a Red Bulborb that respawns 3 days after you kill it?
2016-01-20 21:01:02	@Espyo	I mean, I know there's a "respawn X days after killing" mechanic in P3
2016-01-20 21:01:08	ScruffyChat	that's not the one in the Garden of Hope
2016-01-20 21:01:12	ScruffyChat	Takes 4 days, I think
2016-01-20 21:01:13	@Espyo	the Whiptongue Bulborb at the landing site of the Tropical Wilds is definitely this
2016-01-20 21:01:28	@Espyo	a Dwarf Bulborb with 3
2016-01-20 21:01:39	@Espyo	Iwakko with 1
2016-01-20 21:01:47	@Espyo	I think Iwakko is the Skutterchuck
2016-01-20 21:01:49	@Espyo	I have to get dinner now
2016-01-20 21:01:54	ScruffyChat	iwa is rock
2016-01-20 21:01:55	@Espyo	but so far, it doesn't seem very special
2016-01-20 21:01:56	ScruffyChat	Oh okay
2016-01-20 21:02:00	@Espyo	oh yeah, it is
2016-01-20 21:02:05	@Espyo	so yeah, Skutterchuck
2016-01-20 21:02:10	ScruffyChat	Cool
2016-01-20 21:02:15	@Espyo	after dinner, I'll try ACTUALLY searching on all levels, instead of just GOH
2016-01-20 21:02:20	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-20 21:02:24	ScruffyChat	Hope you find something
2016-01-20 21:02:27	ScruffyChat	And enjoy dinner

2016-01-20 21:18:38	Neocraftz1553	have you espyo?
2016-01-20 21:18:41	ScruffyChat	No
2016-01-20 21:18:49	ScruffyChat	I don't think that happens on Mac
2016-01-20 21:19:00	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure
2016-01-20 21:19:06	ScruffyChat	I think I have experienced the Mac equivalent though
2016-01-20 21:19:14	ScruffyChat	I have to say, it's quite elegant
2016-01-20 21:19:24	Neocraftz1553	alright, that counts
2016-01-20 21:19:44	Neocraftz1553	It happened to me today
2016-01-20 21:20:52	ScruffyChat	Aww man, I'm sorry
2016-01-20 21:21:06	Neocraftz1553	my computer started fizzing and programs started opening and.... other weird stuff
2016-01-20 21:21:12	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-20 21:21:16	ScruffyChat	Fizzing?
2016-01-20 21:21:21	ScruffyChat	Like, you could hear it?
2016-01-20 21:21:35	Neocraftz1553	yes, kinda like static
2016-01-20 21:21:47	Neocraftz1553	I had some music on at the time
2016-01-20 21:22:12	Neocraftz1553	but, luckily for me, the computer is fine now.... I thinm
2016-01-20 21:22:18	ScruffyChat	I hope you have a back up or something
2016-01-20 21:22:26	Neocraftz1553	yes I did
2016-01-20 21:22:40	Neocraftz1553	but I didn't need it, wierdly
2016-01-20 21:23:26	Neocraftz1553	I turned it on and it turned on normally, so I had an antivirus scan it
2016-01-20 21:23:44	Neocraftz1553	it found 134 viruses :P
2016-01-20 21:23:55	Neocraftz1553	I've seen more though
2016-01-20 21:24:04	ScruffyChat	Man
2016-01-20 21:24:13	Neocraftz1553	my friend once had over 900 viruses
2016-01-20 21:24:16	Neocraftz1553	no lie
2016-01-20 21:24:37	ScruffyChat	That's scary
2016-01-20 21:24:54	Neocraftz1553	yes it is very
2016-01-20 21:26:37	Neocraftz1553	on the bright side, I now know there is such thing as a pebibyte
2016-01-20 21:28:05	Neocraftz1553	its bigger than a petabyte, which is bigger than a tebibyte, which is bigger than a terabyte, which is bigger than a gigabyte, and so on
2016-01-20 21:28:17	Neocraftz1553	so much memory
2016-01-20 21:28:28	ScruffyChat	Memory? Taken by viruses?
2016-01-20 21:28:39	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-01-20 21:28:57	Neocraftz1553	I'm not aure if thats even possible
2016-01-20 21:29:15	Neocraftz1553	besides them taking up space
2016-01-20 21:29:41	ScruffyChat	That's what I mean. They took up that space?
2016-01-20 21:29:53	Neocraftz1553	oh, no
2016-01-20 21:30:06	Neocraftz1553	I just have 500 gigabytes
2016-01-20 21:30:28	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-20 21:30:30	Neocraftz1553	I think they took up a megabyte at most
2016-01-20 21:30:48	Neocraftz1553	but the programs they installed took up a gigabyte eacg
2016-01-20 21:30:53	Neocraftz1553	*each
2016-01-20 21:31:27	Neocraftz1553	So basically I spent my morning shooting down viruses and their programs
2016-01-20 21:32:01	Neocraftz1553	again
2016-01-20 21:32:12	Neocraftz1553	it has happened to me once before
2016-01-20 21:32:40	Neocraftz1553	it actually ruined the hard drive of my previous computer
2016-01-20 21:32:53	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-20 21:36:26	Neocraftz1553	yes, it has cost me
2016-01-20 21:36:37	ScruffyChat	I bet
2016-01-20 21:36:43	@Espyo	wtf
2016-01-20 21:36:45	@Espyo	fizzling?
2016-01-20 21:36:51	Neocraftz1553	heh, yeah
2016-01-20 21:36:54	@Espyo	good grief
2016-01-20 21:37:08	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-20 21:37:30	Neocraftz1553	before the blue screen happened some command windows opened up
2016-01-20 21:38:17	@Espyo	ok, no "day" parameter is different than 0, anywhere
2016-01-20 21:38:20	@Espyo	now I can say it safely
2016-01-20 21:38:29	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-20 21:38:30	@Espyo	that really doesn't sound good, Neo
2016-01-20 21:38:34	Neocraftz1553	on what?
2016-01-20 21:38:45	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah, it doesnt loom to good either
2016-01-20 21:38:49	Neocraftz1553	*look
2016-01-20 21:38:51	@Espyo	enemies have this "birthday", "deadday" and "expireday"
2016-01-20 21:38:53	@Espyo	but it's always 0
2016-01-20 21:38:55	@Espyo	so *shrug*
2016-01-20 21:39:23	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-20 21:39:31	Neocraftz1553	that actually sounds pretty cool

2016-01-20 21:42:28	@Espyo	ok, on the plotter script I'm making, I'm also adding a feature to print out fun stats
2016-01-20 21:42:37	@Espyo	like the top 5 mobs that are farthest away from the average position
2016-01-20 21:42:40	Neocraftz1553	so you can see the files on P3?
2016-01-20 21:42:44	@Espyo	meaning the mobs that are farthest away from all other mobs
2016-01-20 21:42:55	@Espyo	meaning mobs that are potentially out of bounds
2016-01-20 21:43:03	@Espyo	I'm also printing the one highest in the air, and lowest
2016-01-20 21:43:07	@Espyo	what other stats can I gather?
2016-01-20 21:43:10	@Espyo	and yeah, all files in P3

2016-01-20 21:48:26	Neocraftz1553	it is "very close to completion", but I have not seen anymore news about it
2016-01-20 21:49:39	Neocraftz1553	oh, and hello Yoshi2

2016-01-20 21:49:47	ScruffyChat	They said this year was more about finishing the new Star Fox
2016-01-20 21:50:01	Neocraftz1553	yes, it is about that
2016-01-20 21:51:11	Neocraftz1553	forgive me for saying this, but I'm not a big fan of the starfox games
2016-01-20 21:51:42	Neocraftz1553	because there is a 100% chance I will get stuck in one part and not be able to pass it

2016-01-20 21:52:12	Neocraftz1553	like in that one starfox game for the GC

2016-01-20 21:57:53	ScruffyChat	15 years of Pikmin
2016-01-20 21:58:04	ScruffyChat	Wonder how many Hocotatian years that is
2016-01-20 21:58:33	Neocraftz1553	over 9000
2016-01-20 21:58:36	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-01-20 22:00:23	Neocraftz1553	I wonder... but if they release it for the 15th anniversity, we'll have to wait untill 2017
2016-01-20 22:00:38	Neocraftz1553	if we do, hopefully they'll release trailers

2016-01-20 22:42:16	ScruffyChat	umm
2016-01-20 22:42:20	ScruffyChat	I think 1000
2016-01-20 22:42:23	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2016-01-20 22:42:30	ScruffyChat	It was not a detailed render though
2016-01-20 22:42:45	Neocraftz1553	I have 1250 right now
2016-01-20 22:43:03	Neocraftz1553	I think that is the moat I will do for the glowstems

2016-01-20 22:43:36	Neocraftz1553	and the more sampling I put, the less space they seem to take up
2016-01-20 22:43:41	ScruffyChat	hm
2016-01-20 22:43:44	ScruffyChat	odd

2016-01-21 00:37:12	@PikFan	though, I heard about a potential ninth planet
2016-01-21 00:37:38	ScruffyChat	Really?
2016-01-21 00:37:45	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-21 00:37:48	ScruffyChat	Remarkable
2016-01-21 00:38:11	@PikFan	indeed
2016-01-21 00:38:11	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing it's some sort of icy body in the Kuiper belt?
2016-01-21 00:38:40	@PikFan	yeah, and it'd explain perturbations in smaller Kuiper belt objects
2016-01-21 00:38:48	ScruffyChat	Oh neat

2016-01-21 00:39:09	ScruffyChat	It just needs some observing
2016-01-21 00:39:16	ScruffyChat	Maybe it's Hocotate
2016-01-21 00:39:24	@PikFan	hehe
2016-01-21 00:41:08	@PikFan	but yeah, they say it has an orbital period of 10,000 years and 10 times the mass of Earth
2016-01-21 00:41:09	ScruffyChat	Well that's exciting! I wonder what we'll name it if it becomes official
2016-01-21 00:41:17	ScruffyChat	10 times the mass of Earth!
2016-01-21 00:42:08	ScruffyChat	around 12000 years humans have watched the skies, so I guess we just never saw this thing
2016-01-21 00:42:18	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-21 00:42:20	ScruffyChat	Maybe it's too dark to see in the night sky

2016-01-21 00:59:30	@PikFan	neat
2016-01-21 00:59:59	@PikFan	made any progress on the community game...?
2016-01-21 01:00:12	@PikFan	I haven't checked the RC
2016-01-21 01:00:15	Neocraftz1553	scruffys?

2016-01-21 01:00:36	@PikFan	ah, nice
2016-01-21 01:00:40	Neocraftz1553	added some more pikmin and a purple pikmin render
2016-01-21 01:00:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah, looks good!
2016-01-21 01:00:58	Neocraftz1553	aaaand... blender crashed :P
2016-01-21 01:01:02	@PikFan	hope that goes well
2016-01-21 01:01:05	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-01-21 01:01:15	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-21 01:02:10	Neocraftz1553	have you noticed something different about each glowstem in my render?
2016-01-21 01:02:19	Neocraftz1553	have you, scruffy?
2016-01-21 01:02:32	@PikFan	no, haven't checked, but I will now
2016-01-21 01:02:35	Neocraftz1553	hehehe

2016-01-21 01:04:42	@PikFan	sorry, the Wii U decided to reload this page :\
2016-01-21 01:04:45	ScruffyChat	The dimensions?
2016-01-21 01:05:11	Neocraftz1553	if by dimensions you mean size, you are correct
2016-01-21 01:05:40	Neocraftz1553	each glowstem is a different size, usually referencing different pikmin
2016-01-21 01:05:56	Neocraftz1553	it is kinda hard to tell, but here are some:
2016-01-21 01:06:11	Neocraftz1553	the purple one is larger
2016-01-21 01:06:20	Neocraftz1553	the gray one is more blocky
2016-01-21 01:06:31	Neocraftz1553	and the pink and white ones are smaller

2016-01-21 01:18:48	En_Passant	ScruffyChat: Can you change the location of enemies and treasures?
2016-01-21 01:18:58	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-21 01:19:08	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I meant to mention that
2016-01-21 01:19:17	ScruffyChat	I'm still going through ship dialog
2016-01-21 01:19:28	ScruffyChat	But it's so much fun, I think you guys'll like it
2016-01-21 01:19:47	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-21 01:19:51	Neocraftz1553	sounds good
2016-01-21 01:20:15	ScruffyChat	But yes, I can change enemy and treasure locations
2016-01-21 01:20:33	ScruffyChat	I think I can even changed what enemy shows up, but I haven't tested that yet
2016-01-21 01:20:45	ScruffyChat	change*
2016-01-21 01:21:10	Neocraftz1553	not to get off topic, but can I request a model, scruffy?
2016-01-21 01:21:16	ScruffyChat	Sure
2016-01-21 01:21:31	ScruffyChat	I really need to get back to that, I've got a lot of requests waiting
2016-01-21 01:21:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-21 01:21:58	Neocraftz1553	I could help you a little with the requests
2016-01-21 01:22:41	Neocraftz1553	I'll just maje a simple "outline" of what they want and then I'll send it to you so you could add a little more detail and stuff
2016-01-21 01:22:59	ScruffyChat	I suppose
2016-01-21 01:23:05	ScruffyChat	What is your request though?
2016-01-21 01:24:20	Neocraftz1553	ok, my request is a model of a Toady Bloyster
2016-01-21 01:26:05	ScruffyChat	Just a normal one? From Pikmin 2 or 3
2016-01-21 01:26:07	Neocraftz1553	Can you do it?
2016-01-21 01:26:21	ScruffyChat	Or different from those two?
2016-01-21 01:26:23	En_Passant	I'm pretty sure you can change which enemy shows up. Remember Espyo's video?
2016-01-21 01:26:34	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I know I can do it in caves
2016-01-21 01:26:36	Neocraftz1553	from 2 if you want, but I would like 3
2016-01-21 01:26:44	ScruffyChat	Sorry, should have clarified
2016-01-21 01:26:46	En_Passant	Do caves and the overworld work differently?
2016-01-21 01:26:53	ScruffyChat	I don't know about overworld areas yet
2016-01-21 01:26:54	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-21 01:26:59	En_Passant	ah
2016-01-21 01:27:12	En_Passant	Speaking of caves, can you edit those?
2016-01-21 01:27:20	En_Passant	Like, change the number of rooms or what not?
2016-01-21 01:27:31	ScruffyChat	I think so, but it's very unstable
2016-01-21 01:27:38	ScruffyChat	There's a high chance it could crash
2016-01-21 01:28:00	En_Passant	brb, dinner

2016-01-21 01:50:36	ScruffyChat	I don't know, the fire department tells us all the things that could start a fire every year
2016-01-21 01:50:43	ScruffyChat	It had to be one of those
2016-01-21 01:51:07	@PikFan	but for some reason, they don't tell you? even if you ask?

2016-01-21 01:53:32	ScruffyChat	It was 20 degrees outside and we all had one thing in mind: warmth
2016-01-21 01:53:49	@PikFan	wow, 20 degrees
2016-01-21 01:54:28	Neocraftz1553	Thats cold
2016-01-21 01:54:30	ScruffyChat	I'm sure it probably gets colder over there; South Carolina is a generally warm state, we aren't used to cold
2016-01-21 01:54:55	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-21 01:55:01	@PikFan	here in Oregon? not really, no
2016-01-21 01:55:24	@PikFan	even during the nighttime it typically doesn't drop to 20
2016-01-21 01:55:34	@PikFan	it's just really, really wet here
2016-01-21 01:55:51	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 01:56:06	Neocraftz1553	so its what you call 'humid'
2016-01-21 01:56:19	Neocraftz1553	ut rains alot over there I'm guessing?
2016-01-21 01:56:20	@PikFan	yeah, the lows for the next week are in the upper 30's-low 40's
2016-01-21 01:56:25	@PikFan	oh yes, very humid
2016-01-21 01:56:31	@PikFan	and it does rain a lot
2016-01-21 01:56:41	@PikFan	it's quite cloudy most days
2016-01-21 01:57:04	@PikFan	the summer's the only time when it's consistently blue skies
2016-01-21 01:57:11	@PikFan	this summer was weird, though

2016-01-21 01:57:37	@PikFan	but this summer there were 6 days when it got over 100 degrees
2016-01-21 01:57:43	@PikFan	the hottest was 105
2016-01-21 01:57:58	Neocraftz1553	yeah, during summer the hottest was 114

2016-01-21 01:58:15	ScruffyChat	I got in the 110s too
2016-01-21 01:58:21	@PikFan	wow
2016-01-21 01:58:46	@PikFan	in December 2013, there was a snowstorm really early on
2016-01-21 01:58:51	Neocraftz1553	yeah a little something sciebtists call: atmosphere heating up
2016-01-21 01:58:59	Neocraftz1553	wait no... global warming
2016-01-21 01:59:24	@PikFan	mm
2016-01-21 01:59:56	@PikFan	but yeah, here in Oregon, it might snow during the winter, and even if it does, we just get like a light dusting, or up to an inch
2016-01-21 01:59:59	@PikFan	not a whole lot
2016-01-21 02:00:11	@PikFan	but in December 2013 we got a whole FOOT of snow
2016-01-21 02:00:14	@PikFan	that's like, rare
2016-01-21 02:00:24	@PikFan	and then after all that: cold snap
2016-01-21 02:00:28	@PikFan	dropped to -10
2016-01-21 02:00:39	@PikFan	for my city, anyway
2016-01-21 02:00:41	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-01-21 02:00:52	@PikFan	almost beat my city's record of -12 set back in 1972
2016-01-21 02:01:05	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-01-21 02:01:18	@PikFan	which was, amazingly, set on the same day that it got down to -10 on
2016-01-21 02:01:41	@PikFan	that's the first time I've experienced subzero temperatures
2016-01-21 02:02:01	ScruffyChat	Aww man, I've never been in subzero
2016-01-21 02:02:19	ScruffyChat	That must have been brutal
2016-01-21 02:02:59	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-21 02:03:02	@PikFan	snow lasted for a week
2016-01-21 02:03:15	@PikFan	normally the snow melts after a day
2016-01-21 02:03:24	@PikFan	but it lasted for an entire week
2016-01-21 02:03:36	@PikFan	school was closed for a whole week
2016-01-21 02:04:00	@PikFan	except for Friday; there was school on Friday but I skipped
2016-01-21 02:04:29	@PikFan	but yeah, it was pretty intense
2016-01-21 02:04:38	@PikFan	and then, in February, we got another foot of snow
2016-01-21 02:04:48	@PikFan	didn't drop into subzero again
2016-01-21 02:04:54	@PikFan	rather, we got an icestorm
2016-01-21 02:04:59	@PikFan	lots of freezing rain
2016-01-21 02:05:12	@PikFan	...so all the snow ended up having a hard icy surface on top
2016-01-21 02:05:16	@PikFan	it was very crunchy
2016-01-21 02:05:29	@PikFan	there were a lot of power outages
2016-01-21 02:05:41	@PikFan	I actually had two power outages
2016-01-21 02:05:54	@PikFan	the first one was only a couple hours and happened at night
2016-01-21 02:06:02	ScruffyChat	That's crazy
2016-01-21 02:06:10	@PikFan	I was taking a nap, then suddenly this extremely bright light woke me up
2016-01-21 02:06:18	@PikFan	even though my blinds were shut
2016-01-21 02:06:28	@PikFan	and then I notice the power's out
2016-01-21 02:06:45	@PikFan	so that happened, the power was fixed pretty quickly
2016-01-21 02:07:01	@PikFan	then the next day, power goes out at about 3:00 and doesn't get fixed till midnight
2016-01-21 02:07:15	ScruffyChat	Man
2016-01-21 02:07:25	@PikFan	that winter was insane
2016-01-21 02:07:31	@PikFan	that NEVER happens here
2016-01-21 02:07:48	@PikFan	two major snowstorms in one winter

2016-01-21 02:16:46	ScruffyChat	Sure, go for it. But I don't think we should link anyone, that could get disastrous
2016-01-21 02:17:54	@PikFan	right, I won't post links
2016-01-21 02:18:26	@PikFan	instead, I'll just ask for suggestions and ask them to come onto IRC if they've got more ideas
2016-01-21 02:18:39	ScruffyChat	Cool!
2016-01-21 02:19:57	ScruffyChat	I guess this means I am updating all the Treasure Hoard and Piklopedia articles
2016-01-21 02:20:52	@PikFan	articles on which wiki?
2016-01-21 02:20:57	ScruffyChat	"Looks like another all-nighter for me!" "Looks like another all-nighter for me!" "LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER ALL-NIGHTER FOR ME!"
2016-01-21 02:21:04	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 02:21:07	En_Passant	Is that a meme now?
2016-01-21 02:21:12	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-01-21 02:21:19	ScruffyChat	Oh, I don't know, I just remember Alph saying that
2016-01-21 02:21:34	ScruffyChat	I don't use memes, I use useful quotes
2016-01-21 02:21:54	En_Passant	He says it twice in the game, and only if he's active when you get one of the phones
2016-01-21 02:22:00	@PikFan	"Hey, I've decided to make a Pikmin 2 night mode! Looks like another all-NIGHTer for me!"
2016-01-21 02:22:04	@PikFan	...bad puns are bad
2016-01-21 02:22:18	En_Passant	that TOTALLY needs to be in, now
2016-01-21 02:22:23	ScruffyChat	Yep
2016-01-21 02:22:33	@PikFan	huh?
2016-01-21 02:22:47	ScruffyChat	I need to reference that somewhere
2016-01-21 02:22:50	ScruffyChat	in the game
2016-01-21 02:22:55	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-21 02:23:12	@PikFan	Pikmin meme 2016: all nighter
2016-01-21 02:23:47	@PikFan	"What are you doing tonight?" "What do you think I'm doing?! I'm playing Pikmin! Looks like another all-nighter for me!!"
2016-01-21 02:24:39	En_Passant	that's a true statement
2016-01-21 02:24:40	ScruffyChat	I think I'm almost done with the general messages from the Ship
2016-01-21 02:24:49	@PikFan	yay
2016-01-21 02:25:02	En_Passant	I accidentally stayed up intl 3 am doing Silver Lake Remix
2016-01-21 02:25:05	En_Passant	*until
2016-01-21 02:25:11	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 02:25:18	ScruffyChat	what do you mean "accidentally"
2016-01-21 02:25:26	@PikFan	accidentally on purpose
2016-01-21 02:25:39	En_Passant	Like, didn't check a clock
2016-01-21 02:25:47	En_Passant	And then whoops, it was 3 a,
2016-01-21 02:25:49	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah, I was just making a jok
2016-01-21 02:25:49	En_Passant	*am
2016-01-21 02:26:13	@PikFan	...when was the last time you checked the time prior?
2016-01-21 02:27:49	En_Passant	it was new year's
2016-01-21 02:27:57	En_Passant	so, the ball dropped
2016-01-21 02:28:30	@PikFan	I can't go 3 hours without checking the time
2016-01-21 02:28:53	En_Passant	... that map is intense
2016-01-21 02:29:16	ScruffyChat	Seriously, the Silver Lake Remix changes you
2016-01-21 02:29:46	En_Passant	I think Distant Tundra Remix is worse
2016-01-21 02:30:33	@PikFan	ah, Silver Lake Remix...
2016-01-21 02:30:47	@PikFan	I remember I had a good long while going at it
2016-01-21 02:30:56	@PikFan	the hardest one for me was Beastly Caverns
2016-01-21 02:31:00	ScruffyChat	I had a long go at the Formidable Oak remix
2016-01-21 02:31:21	@PikFan	Formidable Oak remix was actually really easy from what I remember
2016-01-21 02:31:44	ScruffyChat	I'm probably just bad
2016-01-21 02:31:51	@PikFan	took some getting used to the enemies and whatnot, but I beat it in a few tries
2016-01-21 02:32:01	ScruffyChat	I'm really in no place to be making a /more difficult/, /programming intensive/ mod
2016-01-21 02:32:17	@PikFan	well, how many platinum medals do you have in battle enemies?
2016-01-21 02:32:22	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna be terrible at it 
2016-01-21 02:32:35	ScruffyChat	I've gotten them all the modes all platinum
2016-01-21 02:32:40	ScruffyChat	But it took me a while
2016-01-21 02:32:52	ScruffyChat	Plus, I play Pikmin 2 with a laptop keyboard
2016-01-21 02:33:01	@PikFan	hey, if you've gotten Plasm Wraith platinum, then that's pretty good
2016-01-21 02:33:07	@PikFan	I've only gotten a silver on it
2016-01-21 02:33:11	ScruffyChat	Oh wait
2016-01-21 02:33:16	ScruffyChat	Yeah I only have silver
2016-01-21 02:33:21	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-21 02:33:39	@PikFan	wait, for Plasm Wraith or all the modes...?
2016-01-21 02:33:40	ScruffyChat	I basically need intensive Dodge Whistle to even finish it alive
2016-01-21 02:33:51	ScruffyChat	Just plasm wraith
2016-01-21 02:33:56	@PikFan	okay
2016-01-21 02:34:00	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-01-21 02:34:06	@PikFan	I'm too scared to go back in there
2016-01-21 02:34:14	En_Passant	I should re-do Formidable Oak on my file
2016-01-21 02:34:22	@PikFan	it's just full of nope
2016-01-21 02:34:32	@PikFan	nope
2016-01-21 02:34:35	@PikFan	nope everywhere
2016-01-21 02:35:00	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 02:35:08	@PikFan	I still haven't gotten all platinum in battle enemies
2016-01-21 02:35:21	ScruffyChat	taking a step back and looking at this dialogue, I've gotta say
2016-01-21 02:35:22	@PikFan	Forgotten Cove is going to be HARD
2016-01-21 02:35:58	ScruffyChat	I hope you guys had a decent idea of what the Ship means to say in its dialogues in the original Pikmin 2
2016-01-21 02:36:27	ScruffyChat	You can kiss that goodbye in Pikmin 2: Up late
2016-01-21 02:36:54	@PikFan	heh, why?
2016-01-21 02:37:04	@PikFan	is it like super intelligent or super UNintelligent?
2016-01-21 02:37:14	ScruffyChat	which do you think?
2016-01-21 02:37:25	@PikFan	super intelligent?
2016-01-21 02:37:34	ScruffyChat	Sorry, the latter
2016-01-21 02:37:48	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-21 02:37:48	ScruffyChat	And not unintelligent as in dumb or non-understandable
2016-01-21 02:37:55	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-21 02:38:25	ScruffyChat	But just precious little useful information left that isn't involved in a joke
2016-01-21 02:38:45	@PikFan	so it's a jokester now
2016-01-21 02:38:47	@PikFan	interesting
2016-01-21 02:39:01	En_Passant	It gives information at all?
2016-01-21 02:39:05	@PikFan	I'm sure this'll annoy Olimar even more
2016-01-21 02:39:12	En_Passant	It should do nothing but crack jokes and be sarcastic
2016-01-21 02:39:26	ScruffyChat	That's what I'm trying, but I can't get rid of contoller icons
2016-01-21 02:39:33	ScruffyChat	So I at least have to give it that
2016-01-21 02:39:35	@PikFan	"Hey! Listen! Listen! Hey!
2016-01-21 02:43:12	En_Passant	You know how it has that siren when it's about to say something
2016-01-21 02:43:21	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 02:43:41	En_Passant	One of the shorter dialog boxes should just be him going "I love making that sound because it annoys you"
2016-01-21 02:44:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 02:44:17	ScruffyChat	I've got something similar
2016-01-21 02:44:45	ScruffyChat	I think my favorite passage so far is about the White and Purple Pikmin safely lodged in its hull 
2016-01-21 02:45:03	@PikFan	ooh
2016-01-21 02:45:11	ScruffyChat	I can only write this three lines at a time
2016-01-21 02:45:32	ScruffyChat	And if one character is out of place, something weird could happen in game
2016-01-21 02:45:55	@PikFan	so it also has to be the same number of characters? good grief
2016-01-21 02:46:07	ScruffyChat	yeah, but I've made it work so far
2016-01-21 02:46:10	ScruffyChat	It's a comedic puzzle
2016-01-21 02:46:32	@PikFan	hey, you said it COULD make something weird happen
2016-01-21 02:46:37	@PikFan	so you don't actually know?
2016-01-21 02:48:51	ScruffyChat	There's this one character that I can't see because of the text encoding
2016-01-21 02:48:51	ScruffyChat	But it's EVERYWHERE
2016-01-21 02:48:51	ScruffyChat	And basically, it's the functional character
2016-01-21 02:48:51	ScruffyChat	It separates passages, it signals text color changes and button icons, and if misused, it can make the Ship cut off its dialogue abruptly
2016-01-21 02:48:51	ScruffyChat	which might actually be a good thing
2016-01-21 02:48:52	ScruffyChat	for comedic effect
2016-01-21 02:49:10	ScruffyChat	Anyway, it's a specific process, and tens of thousands of lines to write
2016-01-21 02:49:13	ScruffyChat	But I'm up for it
2016-01-21 02:50:17	@PikFan	hmm
2016-01-21 02:50:43	@PikFan	padding with spaces is allowed again, right?
2016-01-21 02:50:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 02:50:50	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-21 02:50:54	ScruffyChat	But I try to avoid it as much as possible
2016-01-21 02:51:05	ScruffyChat	More content over less
2016-01-21 02:51:11	@PikFan	true
2016-01-21 02:51:19	ScruffyChat	Would you guys like a preview?
2016-01-21 02:51:25	@PikFan	yes!
2016-01-21 02:51:37	ScruffyChat	Here's that passage I was talking about
2016-01-21 02:52:18	ScruffyChat	?
2016-01-21 02:52:23	ScruffyChat	The two types are sleeping well, and seem perfectly content living in my exhaust pipes.?
2016-01-21 02:52:51	@PikFan	heh\
2016-01-21 02:52:54	@PikFan	*-\
2016-01-21 02:53:07	En_Passant	No jokes about the Purples causing a blockage?
2016-01-21 02:53:22	ScruffyChat	You can call out the slack Pikmin by standing in ?ˇ
2016-01-21 02:53:22	ScruffyChat	On a separate note, be wary of working too much. Being lazy is a great way to lead by example.
2016-01-21 02:53:22	ScruffyChat	To ?ˇ
2016-01-21 02:53:22	ScruffyChat	That's it
2016-01-21 02:53:39	ScruffyChat	That comes in the passage about Purples in the hull alone
2016-01-21 02:55:10	@PikFan	nice
2016-01-21 02:55:14	@PikFan	I'm liking these
2016-01-21 02:55:20	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2016-01-21 02:55:28	ScruffyChat	They get even less sensical
2016-01-21 02:55:35	ScruffyChat	Sometimes the Ship just goes on tangents
2016-01-21 02:56:04	@PikFan	awesome
2016-01-21 03:04:33	ScruffyChat	They must be blue Pikmin!  Like the other types, they are Pikmin, but also blue
2016-01-21 03:04:58	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 03:05:23	@PikFan	test
2016-01-21 03:19:31	ScruffyChat	Test?
2016-01-21 03:33:22	@PikFan	I was testing my sound :P
2016-01-21 03:33:30	ScruffyChat	Ah, heh

2016-01-21 04:56:09	@PikFan	I HATE SNIPERS
2016-01-21 04:56:16	@PikFan	ugggghhhhhhhhh
2016-01-21 04:57:05	ScruffyChat	Hahaha
2016-01-21 04:57:12	ScruffyChat	So that's where you were
2016-01-21 04:57:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-21 04:57:25	@PikFan	I just ragequit
2016-01-21 04:57:43	@PikFan	...that sounds weird
2016-01-21 04:58:15	@PikFan	but yeah, I had to get out of there
2016-01-21 04:58:22	@PikFan	it was becoming too much
2016-01-21 04:58:28	ScruffyChat	I understand
2016-01-21 04:58:38	ScruffyChat	So you can die in Splatoon?
2016-01-21 04:58:43	@PikFan	yes
2016-01-21 04:59:24	ScruffyChat	Huh, I didn't think paint/ink would do that
2016-01-21 04:59:31	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 04:59:39	@PikFan	well, you respawn a few seconds later
2016-01-21 04:59:54	@PikFan	it just becomes really annoying when you get killed over and over and over and over again
2016-01-21 05:00:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I've been there
2016-01-21 05:01:03	@PikFan	heh, really? in what game?
2016-01-21 05:01:17	ScruffyChat	Any shooter I've tried, really
2016-01-21 05:01:23	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-21 05:01:35	@PikFan	well, that's too bad
2016-01-21 05:01:37	ScruffyChat	My brother's gotten me to try Call of Duty, Uncharted, and Star Wars Battlefront
2016-01-21 05:01:50	ScruffyChat	I'd never survive
2016-01-21 05:01:58	ScruffyChat	I'm better off in Pikmin
2016-01-21 05:02:03	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 05:04:09	ScruffyChat	Do you by any chance remember that huge number that was the maximum Pikmin cap?
2016-01-21 05:04:22	ScruffyChat	There was a Youtube video where someone reaches it
2016-01-21 05:04:35	@PikFan	oh, it was Miles' underflow
2016-01-21 05:04:51	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYnSVjLtgeg
2016-01-21 05:07:29	ScruffyChat	Okay, thanks
2016-01-21 05:07:44	En_Passant	oh my
2016-01-21 05:08:07	@PikFan	hehehe
2016-01-21 05:08:07	ScruffyChat	What does that number actually read?
2016-01-21 05:08:14	ScruffyChat	I know it ends with 7025
2016-01-21 05:08:16	ScruffyChat	7925*
2016-01-21 05:09:20	En_Passant	It's 2^32-1
2016-01-21 05:09:28	En_Passant	Not surprising, GameCube's a 32-bit game
2016-01-21 05:09:31	En_Passant	*system
2016-01-21 05:09:54	@PikFan	in other words, (numbers?) 4294967295
2016-01-21 05:10:13	En_Passant	yeah
2016-01-21 05:10:14	@PikFan	why?
2016-01-21 05:10:16	ScruffyChat	Okay then, never mind
2016-01-21 05:10:25	ScruffyChat	I found a file that was all arithmetic
2016-01-21 05:10:37	En_Passant	The number of Pikmin on the field is apparently stored as a 32-bit unsigned integer
2016-01-21 05:10:49	ScruffyChat	And thought I recognized that number; there is a number here with 7925
2016-01-21 05:10:53	ScruffyChat	But I was mistaken
2016-01-21 05:10:57	En_Passant	The number ranges from 0 to 2^32-1
2016-01-21 05:11:30	En_Passant	(x-bit = can store 0-2^x)
2016-01-21 05:11:56	En_Passant	It was at 0, so what happened when it went down one was that it looped around to the highest value
2016-01-21 05:12:24	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 05:13:15	En_Passant	The bit is the smallest unit of computing - a single on/off switch, or boolean
2016-01-21 05:13:16	ScruffyChat	I'm trying to find the parameter that stops in-field Pikmin from spawning at 100
2016-01-21 05:13:22	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-01-21 05:14:07	En_Passant	Actually, I lied, I'm surprised it's 32-bit
2016-01-21 05:14:16	En_Passant	Larger bit sizes take up more memory, obviously
2016-01-21 05:14:34	En_Passant	If they never intended it to be above 100, why not just do 8-bit (127)?
2016-01-21 05:15:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 05:15:49	@PikFan	21:13	En_Passant	The bit is the smallest unit of computing - a single on/off switch, or boolean
2016-01-21 05:15:55	@PikFan	what about qubits
2016-01-21 05:16:29	En_Passant	Quantum computing
2016-01-21 05:16:49	@PikFan	that question was sarcastic :P
2016-01-21 05:17:14	En_Passant	oh
2016-01-21 05:17:21	@PikFan	lol
2016-01-21 05:17:30	@PikFan	nah, I know what qubits are
2016-01-21 05:17:54	En_Passant	Sorry I can't read your mind
2016-01-21 05:18:00	@PikFan	I wonder when quantum computers will become mainstream
2016-01-21 05:18:16	@PikFan	no it's fine
2016-01-21 05:18:36	@PikFan	the problem with text-based chat is that you can't tell if someone is being sarcastic or serious
2016-01-21 05:18:43	@PikFan	unless you know them really really well, I guess
2016-01-21 05:19:27	@PikFan	but anyway, quantum computers, Li-Fi, augmented reality...
2016-01-21 05:19:34	@PikFan	I can see all these working together
2016-01-21 05:19:52	ScruffyChat	To take over our brains!
2016-01-21 05:19:57	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 05:20:25	@PikFan	Digital Revolution II
2016-01-21 05:40:18	En_Passant	I'm officially at 50 treasures for Pikmin V
2016-01-21 05:40:27	@PikFan	nice
2016-01-21 05:40:29	En_Passant	Granted, almost all of them are highly incomplete
2016-01-21 05:40:35	En_Passant	But yay, 25%
2016-01-21 05:40:41	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-21 05:41:12	En_Passant	I should put them on Fanon at some point
2016-01-21 05:41:32	En_Passant	Maybe you guys can help shape them up
2016-01-21 05:41:58	@PikFan	by incomplete, do you mean like value, location, etc?
2016-01-21 05:45:36	En_Passant	Value, name, notes, mostly
2016-01-21 05:46:01	En_Passant	I'm not too worried about location because they're mostly arbitrary and are best distributed once I have all 200
2016-01-21 05:46:20	@PikFan	oh hmm
2016-01-21 05:46:34	@PikFan	I thought you meant you'd already named them lol
2016-01-21 05:46:44	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-21 05:46:54	En_Passant	I think I'm getting too hung up on "quality"
2016-01-21 05:47:01	En_Passant	Like, stuff they might find interesting
2016-01-21 05:47:07	En_Passant	Many of the P2 treasures weren't very exciting
2016-01-21 05:47:27	En_Passant	Massive Receptable and Ancient Ad series, namely
2016-01-21 05:47:41	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-01-21 05:48:02	ScruffyChat	They were interesting in the novelty of the brand names
2016-01-21 05:48:08	ScruffyChat	Mainly
2016-01-21 05:48:27	En_Passant	Novelty?
2016-01-21 05:48:51	ScruffyChat	It being a new and clever idea
2016-01-21 05:49:56	En_Passant	Still don't get it
2016-01-21 05:50:09	En_Passant	They couldn't read the labels
2016-01-21 05:50:25	ScruffyChat	I mean it's a new and clever idea for a video game
2016-01-21 05:50:35	ScruffyChat	It was at the time
2016-01-21 05:51:13	En_Passant	Oh, because there were so many brand names in a video game
2016-01-21 05:52:04	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-21 05:53:45	En_Passant	And we don't have that going for us
2016-01-21 05:54:37	ScruffyChat	yeah... but you'd still like your treasures to have an element of novelty
2016-01-21 05:54:52	ScruffyChat	Is there any constraint on what your treasures can be?
2016-01-21 05:56:25	En_Passant	No fruits
2016-01-21 05:56:35	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-21 05:56:54	ScruffyChat	Can you give us some examples of object you've thought of so far?
2016-01-21 05:57:54	En_Passant	Do you want just the real-world objects, or a brief description of their depictions in the game?
2016-01-21 05:58:05	ScruffyChat	Both would be best
2016-01-21 05:58:13	En_Passant	Alright
2016-01-21 05:58:18	En_Passant	I don't have a lot of those filled out
2016-01-21 05:58:25	ScruffyChat	That's okay
2016-01-21 05:58:31	ScruffyChat	We can fill them as we go
2016-01-21 05:59:09	@PikFan	brb
2016-01-21 05:59:11	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@u-78-94-868-36.hsd6.or.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-01-21 05:59:19	En_Passant	I thought you wanted to see some ones that are already filled out, at least partially
2016-01-21 05:59:34	En_Passant	Tonight's not really the time to start a project like that, anyway
2016-01-21 05:59:52	ScruffyChat	Okay, then, we can just stick to the partially filled out ones
2016-01-21 06:00:03	En_Passant	Just to get some ideas swimming
2016-01-21 06:00:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:00:51	En_Passant	Sample #1 (likely going to be #1 in-game, too):
2016-01-21 06:01:01	En_Passant	Pik Pik Colossus (baby carrot)
2016-01-21 06:01:27	En_Passant	You know, the small cylindrical-like ones that come in bags
2016-01-21 06:01:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:01:35	ScruffyChat	That's great
2016-01-21 06:01:57	En_Passant	Olimar thinks villages subsisted on growing singular plants of them
2016-01-21 06:02:09	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 06:02:11	ScruffyChat	Cool
2016-01-21 06:02:35	ScruffyChat	Oh, I think Pikpik is normally spelled without a space, unless you intended to write it like that
2016-01-21 06:03:01	En_Passant	That was not intentional
2016-01-21 06:03:01	En_Passant	Will fix
2016-01-21 06:03:14	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-21 06:03:19	En_Passant	Sample #2:
2016-01-21 06:03:26	En_Passant	Aposematic Tongue (candied ginger)
2016-01-21 06:03:48	En_Passant	It makes sense if you know what they look and feel like
2016-01-21 06:04:05	En_Passant	Basically, it's bright, shiny, and quite bitter
2016-01-21 06:04:22	ScruffyChat	Ah, yeah
2016-01-21 06:04:35	ScruffyChat	oh I love that stuf
2016-01-21 06:04:37	ScruffyChat	stuff*
2016-01-21 06:04:59	ScruffyChat	Would it be a package, or just one candy?
2016-01-21 06:05:05	En_Passant	Just one
2016-01-21 06:05:09	En_Passant	Those things are pretty big
2016-01-21 06:06:00	En_Passant	Yeah, one time, my sister sampled one at the store, thinking it was a dried mango slice
2016-01-21 06:06:31	En_Passant	She ignored the sign and took it out of the bin with her hand, and we still give her crap over it being instant karma
2016-01-21 06:06:53	En_Passant	That store is also where I work now
2016-01-21 06:06:57	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-01-21 06:07:05	ScruffyChat	Oh, cool
2016-01-21 06:07:20	En_Passant	Anyway, Sample #3:
2016-01-21 06:07:30	En_Passant	Sleepquaker (miniature gong)
2016-01-21 06:07:37	En_Passant	It's loud
2016-01-21 06:07:43	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:07:49	ScruffyChat	That's a good name for it
2016-01-21 06:08:09	En_Passant	I like my sales pitch for it
2016-01-21 06:08:13	En_Passant	"The ultimate in sleep-slaying technology! Set it up in the workplace to have an easy and effective reminder that truancy is not allowed."
2016-01-21 06:08:32	ScruffyChat	haha
2016-01-21 06:08:55	ScruffyChat	Oh man, you got the sales pitch mood just right
2016-01-21 06:09:18	En_Passant	Thank you
2016-01-21 06:09:25	En_Passant	It also gives the Pluckaphone
2016-01-21 06:09:29	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 06:09:53	ScruffyChat	Makes sense
2016-01-21 06:10:31	En_Passant	So yeah, stuff like that
2016-01-21 06:11:36	ScruffyChat	You're off to a very good start
2016-01-21 06:11:48	En_Passant	I have a set that's dried pasta which the explorers think are primitive tools
2016-01-21 06:11:54	ScruffyChat	or, quarterly milestone
2016-01-21 06:11:57	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 06:12:12	ScruffyChat	A set of just dried pasta? That's funny
2016-01-21 06:12:19	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:12:27	En_Passant	None of them are long noodles, though
2016-01-21 06:12:34	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:12:45	ScruffyChat	That'd be a bit awkward for Pikmin to carry
2016-01-21 06:12:56	En_Passant	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:13:14	En_Passant	I haven't gotten creative names for them yet, but I know mostly what they'll be
2016-01-21 06:13:40	En_Passant	One's ravioli, which to them is a good size for a hut
2016-01-21 06:13:59	En_Passant	And it collapses when boiled, so it's a teepee
2016-01-21 06:14:08	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 06:14:27	En_Passant	Another's rotini (the spiral one)
2016-01-21 06:14:39	En_Passant	I'm thinking of having it be a worm gear
2016-01-21 06:14:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:14:49	ScruffyChat	Or an auger
2016-01-21 06:14:57	En_Passant	Which I will directly compare to an actual worm gear which is also a treasure
2016-01-21 06:15:07	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 06:15:18	ScruffyChat	Neat, I have a worm gear too!
2016-01-21 06:15:19	En_Passant	Actually, an auger would be better
2016-01-21 06:15:26	En_Passant	(for the pasta)
2016-01-21 06:15:57	En_Passant	Worm gears wouldn't have much use in a subsistence-based society
2016-01-21 06:16:05	ScruffyChat	True
2016-01-21 06:16:07	En_Passant	Something that drills holes would
2016-01-21 06:16:34	ScruffyChat	Ah, my worm gear is called Skewed Sprocket
2016-01-21 06:17:41	ScruffyChat	What other pasta is there?
2016-01-21 06:19:02	En_Passant	Farfalle, macaroni (a tube), cavatappi, tortellini, orecchietti, rotelle (a wheel), and conchiglie
2016-01-21 06:19:14	En_Passant	I had comparison in mind when I chose them
2016-01-21 06:19:27	En_Passant	But that was a while ago and I've forgotten what most of them look like lol
2016-01-21 06:19:42	En_Passant	Nothing an image search can't fix, though
2016-01-21 06:20:01	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-01-21 06:20:04	En_Passant	The current name for the set is "Progenitor's Tools"
2016-01-21 06:20:12	ScruffyChat	Sounds good
2016-01-21 06:20:27	ScruffyChat	I think you should add somewhere in Olimar
2016-01-21 06:20:31	ScruffyChat	Olimar's notes*
2016-01-21 06:21:12	ScruffyChat	That he has a nagging suspicion that these aren't tools because they are made from dough
2016-01-21 06:21:54	En_Passant	That's why he thinks they're primitive tools
2016-01-21 06:22:06	ScruffyChat	Ah I see
2016-01-21 06:22:17	En_Passant	He thinks dough was the best material of that time
2016-01-21 06:22:32	ScruffyChat	Heh, that's brilliant
2016-01-21 06:24:19	ScruffyChat	Perhaps then, he should confess in one article that he ate a little of one
2016-01-21 06:24:48	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-21 06:25:19	En_Passant	Speaking of sprockets, I have one of those, too
2016-01-21 06:25:35	ScruffyChat	Oh? Besides the worm gear?
2016-01-21 06:25:57	En_Passant	I have a set of that stuff
2016-01-21 06:26:07	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 06:26:08	En_Passant	It's the "Industriak mk. II" series
2016-01-21 06:26:20	En_Passant	Calling back to the Industrial Set of P2
2016-01-21 06:26:26	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:26:44	ScruffyChat	So would it still be a series? Or a set
2016-01-21 06:26:52	En_Passant	Is there a difference?
2016-01-21 06:26:57	ScruffyChat	No
2016-01-21 06:27:05	En_Passant	Oh, I see what you mean
2016-01-21 06:27:11	ScruffyChat	The Industrial set was the only "set" though
2016-01-21 06:27:13	En_Passant	They're all called series in V
2016-01-21 06:27:20	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-21 06:27:40	En_Passant	I don't know why the Industrial Set was a set
2016-01-21 06:28:03	ScruffyChat	me neither
2016-01-21 06:28:52	ScruffyChat	Maybe because Olimar noted some of the treasures fit together
2016-01-21 06:29:10	ScruffyChat	They're more of a set of interlocking objects than a series of odds and ends
2016-01-21 06:29:26	En_Passant	Maybe
2016-01-21 06:29:50	ScruffyChat	Any other series in mind?
2016-01-21 06:30:10	En_Passant	I have a couple of plant-based ones
2016-01-21 06:31:17	En_Passant	There's the Stone Relic series, which is old real-life relics
2016-01-21 06:31:33	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-21 06:31:46	En_Passant	I only have three items in that right now
2016-01-21 06:31:46	ScruffyChat	Such as coins, medallions, things like that?
2016-01-21 06:32:05	En_Passant	A Kokepelli idol, a dogu, and a Venus statue, currently
2016-01-21 06:32:21	En_Passant	The last one's pushing being E-rated
2016-01-21 06:33:20	ScruffyChat	yeah...
2016-01-21 06:33:23	ScruffyChat	Good ideas though
2016-01-21 06:33:35	ScruffyChat	Perhaps you could make the statue chipped or worn
2016-01-21 06:33:43	En_Passant	oh yeah
2016-01-21 06:35:03	En_Passant	I was going to have the Dogu and Venus statue be thought of as male-female
2016-01-21 06:35:12	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 06:35:12	En_Passant	Of course, in real life they're not from the same cultures
2016-01-21 06:35:17	ScruffyChat	True
2016-01-21 06:35:43	ScruffyChat	yeah... I've learned this from feedback on my writing
2016-01-21 06:36:03	ScruffyChat	If you want to create male and female symbols, you want to make them nearly identical
2016-01-21 06:36:09	ScruffyChat	Such as chess pieces
2016-01-21 06:36:46	ScruffyChat	Wait sorry, I said that incorrectly
2016-01-21 06:37:57	ScruffyChat	If you have male and female symbols, you want to make them /balanced/
2016-01-21 06:38:07	ScruffyChat	they don't have to be identical
2016-01-21 06:38:29	En_Passant	Balanced?
2016-01-21 06:38:52	ScruffyChat	And I suppose between the slimmer, lighter form of the Venus statue and the rounder darker form of the dogu, there is balance
2016-01-21 06:39:10	ScruffyChat	Even if they are from different cultures
2016-01-21 06:39:26	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-21 06:39:31	En_Passant	not that venus statue
2016-01-21 06:39:33	En_Passant	The ancient ones
2016-01-21 06:39:48	En_Passant	Like the Venus of Willendorf
2016-01-21 06:40:04	ScruffyChat	Oooohhhhh
2016-01-21 06:40:12	ScruffyChat	haha okay then you're set
2016-01-21 06:40:29	ScruffyChat	That does work in comparison to the dogu
2016-01-21 06:40:31	ScruffyChat	I think so
2016-01-21 06:41:12	En_Passant	They also have a bit of practical value
2016-01-21 06:41:21	En_Passant	I want to put the 10x carrying of Purples to more use
2016-01-21 06:41:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 06:41:32	En_Passant	by having more treasures weighing more than 100
2016-01-21 06:41:40	ScruffyChat	definitely
2016-01-21 06:41:55	En_Passant	That actually balances them, in a way
2016-01-21 06:41:56	ScruffyChat	Or even close to 100
2016-01-21 06:42:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it does
2016-01-21 06:44:13	ScruffyChat	I just figured out how to replace what enemies are present in above ground areas
2016-01-21 06:44:19	En_Passant	yay
2016-01-21 06:44:20	ScruffyChat	It's just one number
2016-01-21 06:44:42	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately that number doesn't progress in the Piklopedia order
2016-01-21 06:44:52	ScruffyChat	So I'm going through and testing each one
2016-01-21 06:45:01	En_Passant	probably the order they were programmed in
2016-01-21 06:45:19	En_Passant	Kinda like how Rhydon and Kangaskhan are at the beginning of Red and Blue's indices
2016-01-21 06:45:41	En_Passant	Actually, you mentioning chess pieces made me think of a couple of treasures
2016-01-21 06:45:50	En_Passant	Both for the Stone Relic series
2016-01-21 06:45:55	ScruffyChat	Mhm?
2016-01-21 06:45:59	En_Passant	A Euro and a checkers piece
2016-01-21 06:46:09	ScruffyChat	Nice!
2016-01-21 06:46:52	En_Passant	The joke being that the checkers piece is being confused for being the same type of object as the Euro and the currencies from 2
2016-01-21 06:49:02	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2016-01-21 06:49:02	ScruffyChat	Hmm, let's see
2016-01-21 06:49:09	ScruffyChat	You could also include a zen rock
2016-01-21 06:49:43	En_Passant	Google shows stacked rocks
2016-01-21 06:49:57	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-21 06:50:16	En_Passant	Those work by precise placement so the center of mass isn't lopsided
2016-01-21 06:50:23	En_Passant	No way that could be carried back without it toppling
2016-01-21 06:50:31	ScruffyChat	True
2016-01-21 06:51:44	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-21 06:52:51	En_Passant	I have a couple more sets if you want to hear them
2016-01-21 06:52:58	ScruffyChat	absolutely
2016-01-21 06:53:51	En_Passant	There's the Geology series
2016-01-21 06:54:05	En_Passant	Items confused for naturally-occurring minerals
2016-01-21 06:54:14	ScruffyChat	Yep
2016-01-21 06:54:29	En_Passant	The series has konpeito, chalk, and a crayon in it
2016-01-21 06:54:54	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 06:54:57	En_Passant	Konpeito being a special treasure, as it's actually an open pack
2016-01-21 06:55:09	En_Passant	You carry them back like the Pustules in 3
2016-01-21 06:55:43	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 06:55:57	ScruffyChat	that's clever
2016-01-21 06:56:38	En_Passant	The last one is the Prototype Series, which is an assortment of engineering-like items
2016-01-21 06:56:44	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 06:57:17	En_Passant	Right now it's a ship from a ship-in-a-bottle (you break the bottle to get it), toys of an airplane and a truck, and LEGO pieces
2016-01-21 06:57:28	En_Passant	And a model train
2016-01-21 06:57:34	ScruffyChat	Hehe cool
2016-01-21 06:57:50	En_Passant	The LEGO pieces being varying sizes like the Crimson Banquet
2016-01-21 06:58:00	ScruffyChat	I see
2016-01-21 07:00:08	En_Passant	And then, of course, the upgrade series
2016-01-21 07:01:33	ScruffyChat	Ugh Pikmin Fanon is giving me the "fatal error" message, I can't see your upgrades
2016-01-21 07:02:21	En_Passant	It's back
2016-01-21 07:02:23	ScruffyChat	Ah, there we go
2016-01-21 07:03:05	En_Passant	Only a couple of my upgrades have names, which is what's on the page
2016-01-21 07:03:20	En_Passant	But all but the Scorch Guard have their real-world objects
2016-01-21 07:03:35	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2016-01-21 07:03:48	ScruffyChat	Can you list them? I'd like to see what you've thought of
2016-01-21 07:05:41	En_Passant	Treasure Hunter is a stud finder
2016-01-21 07:05:50	En_Passant	My mom gave me a weird look when I asked to see hers
2016-01-21 07:06:15	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 07:06:26	En_Passant	Mobility Shoes needs a new name and is a kid's cleat
2016-01-21 07:07:00	En_Passant	Anti-Electrifier is a resistor used in circuitry
2016-01-21 07:07:16	En_Passant	Mega Tweeter is a microphone. I stole that from you
2016-01-21 07:07:44	ScruffyChat	Heh that's alright
2016-01-21 07:07:47	En_Passant	I don't want to call it Vocal Nova Blaster, though
2016-01-21 07:08:00	En_Passant	Not very catchy
2016-01-21 07:08:23	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2016-01-21 07:08:24	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-01-21 07:08:24	ScruffyChat	Oooh new discovery
2016-01-21 07:08:24	ScruffyChat	Sorry to interrupt
2016-01-21 07:08:47	ScruffyChat	That's true, I just wanted to make a reference
2016-01-21 07:09:40	En_Passant	New discovery?
2016-01-21 07:10:00	ScruffyChat	A number representing "birth_type"
2016-01-21 07:10:14	ScruffyChat	Set to 0, the enemy will be normally visible
2016-01-21 07:10:46	ScruffyChat	Set to 1 or 2, the enemy will fall from the sky when triggered by leaders or Pikmin, respectively
2016-01-21 07:10:59	En_Passant	ooh
2016-01-21 07:11:20	En_Passant	Nothing for emerging from the ground?
2016-01-21 07:12:00	ScruffyChat	I'm still testing more numbers
2016-01-21 07:12:51	ScruffyChat	Anyway, how about the other upgrades?
2016-01-21 07:13:02	En_Passant	Omega Fist is a brass knuckle
2016-01-21 07:13:32	En_Passant	It doesn't fit well at Olimar's size
2016-01-21 07:14:02	ScruffyChat	heh, that's okay
2016-01-21 07:14:30	ScruffyChat	Most of the Explorer's Friend Series was only /inspiration/ for the ugrades
2016-01-21 07:15:09	En_Passant	I disagree
2016-01-21 07:15:16	--	UltraMartyMcFly is now known as UltraMario
2016-01-21 07:15:38	En_Passant	Most of them were integrated into projects the Ship was already working on for some reason
2016-01-21 07:15:44	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-01-21 07:15:46	ScruffyChat	right
2016-01-21 07:16:48	En_Passant	I don't think the Brass Knuckle was one of those, though
2016-01-21 07:17:02	En_Passant	That makes it a little harder to think of something good
2016-01-21 07:17:38	En_Passant	Reinforcement is a ball of kevlar
2016-01-21 07:18:09	ScruffyChat	Good choice
2016-01-21 07:18:38	En_Passant	Already went over Pluckaphone
2016-01-21 07:18:51	En_Passant	And the Area Guide is a map
2016-01-21 07:19:03	En_Passant	Rolled up so you can't see its contents, though
2016-01-21 07:19:07	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 07:19:17	En_Passant	Trololol
2016-01-21 07:19:23	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-21 07:19:48	En_Passant	I do have a name for the kevlar
2016-01-21 07:19:51	En_Passant	Immortal Fabric
2016-01-21 07:20:07	ScruffyChat	That's good
2016-01-21 07:25:56	ScruffyChat	I have to turn in for the night
2016-01-21 07:26:02	En_Passant	me too
2016-01-21 07:26:08	ScruffyChat	I might be on tomorrow, but I have some work to get done
2016-01-21 07:26:14	ScruffyChat	Er, today
2016-01-21 07:26:21	En_Passant	Won't be on much tomorrow, another full school-work day
2016-01-21 07:26:27	En_Passant	But I'm free Friday
2016-01-21 07:26:42	ScruffyChat	Cool, I'll probably be on then
2016-01-21 07:26:57	En_Passant	Goodnight

2016-01-21 18:38:25	@J	Yoshi2: what did you do?
2016-01-21 18:38:31	@J	 /a little late
2016-01-21 18:41:29	Yoshi2	J: remember the picture of a gamecube controller that was very thin? That format is actually palette based, with each pixel being able to use one of 256 colors defined in a palette
2016-01-21 18:42:03	Yoshi2	which explains why the image was very thin, because I tried to parse it as RGBA
2016-01-21 18:42:47	@J	I thought it was very fat
2016-01-21 18:42:54	@J	but yeah, 1-byte pixels instead of 2-byte
2016-01-21 18:43:06	@J	that makes sense, I can see it
2016-01-21 18:43:15	@J	each got stretched into 2 pixels
2016-01-21 18:43:47	@J	so is the palette embedded in the file, or is there a single assumed palette, or maybe one stored elsewhere?

2016-01-21 18:44:50	Yoshi2	the palette is stored in a section that comes right before the image data section

2016-01-21 18:45:45	Testyo	there is also the option to completely rewrite the message parsing because right now it today
2016-01-21 18:47:39	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-21 18:47:51	Yoshi2	Espyo: I figured out the image format (I think), it's actually palette based with each pixel having one of 256 colors
2016-01-21 18:48:14	@Espyo	oh, so it really is palette based
2016-01-21 18:48:25	@Espyo	so those greys we saw on the GC controller...
2016-01-21 18:48:29	@Espyo	because those were pretty accurate
2016-01-21 18:48:33	@Espyo	shading and all
2016-01-21 18:49:07	Yoshi2	I was trying to parse the file as RBGA with one byte for each, which resulted in the image being much thinner than it should be
2016-01-21 18:49:44	Yoshi2	but now I need to figure out how the picture is created, because it still looks nothing like what it is supposed to be
2016-01-21 18:50:38	Yoshi2	I was pretty close yesterday, so I should use that as a base
2016-01-21 18:56:20	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-21 19:07:48	@J	hmm, really?
2016-01-21 19:07:57	@J	what does it look like?
2016-01-21 19:12:04	Yoshi2	J: here is one of my attempts: http://i.imgur.com/SiFXlRc.png
2016-01-21 19:12:35	Yoshi2	I had several attempts with varying degrees of recognizability
2016-01-21 19:19:11	@J	wow
2016-01-21 19:19:20	@J	that's still wide though
2016-01-21 19:19:35	@J	that's not the same image as before, is it?
2016-01-21 19:19:36	--	UltraMario is now known as UltraMartyMcFly
2016-01-21 19:19:43	Yoshi2	not the same image
2016-01-21 19:20:14	@J	odd, the other one only had vertical lines, this has horizontal and vertical
2016-01-21 19:20:37	@J	like pixels are mixed up with ones both below and to the sides
2016-01-21 19:20:53	@J	well, good luck with that

2016-01-21 19:22:17	Yoshi2	the code is a bit different now, so the result is different
2016-01-21 19:22:55	@J	yeah, but I guess if it didn't look mixed up vertically before and does now, you've gone backwards?
2016-01-21 19:23:06	@J	I don't know, just the feeling I get
2016-01-21 19:25:11	Yoshi2	I have an idea on how to do it, just need to implement it
2016-01-21 19:25:40	Yoshi2	basically, I need to read 4 bytes, but project them on the y axis
2016-01-21 19:40:08	Yoshi2	I hope this works
2016-01-21 19:40:38	Yoshi2	it kinda worked except not quite :/

2016-01-21 19:49:27	Yoshi2	this result is pretty good
2016-01-21 19:49:52	Yoshi2	you can see the 8x4 tile configuration

2016-01-21 19:57:31	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/woop.png so many objects... and these don't even include plants
2016-01-21 19:57:38	@Espyo	the way the objects are spread about the files is almost random
2016-01-21 19:57:45	@Espyo	some make sense, like p30 is Olimar's memos and such
2016-01-21 19:57:50	@Espyo	but other stuff is just random
2016-01-21 19:58:03	@Espyo	like most of the objects on the left side of that are on default.txt, but a few of the right side are also there

2016-01-21 20:01:20	@Espyo	also the image cuts off because I didn't set up some things right
2016-01-21 20:05:57	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that's exactly where I saw the Yellow Spectralid
2016-01-21 20:06:33	@Espyo	the "Yel.imi"

2016-01-21 20:06:53	@Espyo	yeah, the Spectralid is definitely inside the Portal's radius, now that I look at it
2016-01-21 20:07:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 20:07:27	@Espyo	can't remember if I found anything interesting on the stats

2016-01-21 20:08:04	@Espyo	yeah, it was
2016-01-21 20:08:07	ScruffyChat	Wow!

2016-01-21 20:08:39	@Espyo	awesome, Yoshi2!
2016-01-21 20:09:44	@Espyo	...I was looking at the X
2016-01-21 20:09:46	@Espyo	take 2
2016-01-21 20:09:53	@Espyo	highest is GFruit, at Y = 210
2016-01-21 20:10:00	@Espyo	so just a bit higher than those Spectralids
2016-01-21 20:10:04	@Espyo	Gate is lowest, at -110
2016-01-21 20:10:04	ScruffyChat	Hm
2016-01-21 20:10:22	ScruffyChat	is the Gfruit the one in the elevator platforms puzzle?
2016-01-21 20:10:22	@Espyo	oh, the Spectralids are at 70 and 80
2016-01-21 20:10:23	@Espyo	bleh
2016-01-21 20:10:26	Yoshi2	turns out, there was some truth to "This Format uses a palette in RGB5A1 Format, the Pixel data is stored in 8x4 pixel tiles.

2016-01-21 20:10:31	@Espyo	let me confirm

2016-01-21 20:10:45	Yoshi2	now to apply the palette to it
2016-01-21 20:10:54	@Espyo	yeah, that's the one
2016-01-21 20:11:04	@Espyo	so that height is 200? that means the Spectralids aren't very high at all
2016-01-21 20:11:10	@Espyo	unless that entire section of the map is higher up than normal
2016-01-21 20:11:14	@Espyo	lemme check nearby objects

2016-01-21 20:11:58	@Espyo	Zest Bomb nearby is at 170
2016-01-21 20:12:07	@Espyo	guess that means that section of the map is just higher
2016-01-21 20:12:13	@Espyo	which is kinda crap for my stats, but ok
2016-01-21 20:12:29	@Espyo	I REALLY want to plot out a specific thing, though

2016-01-21 20:14:34	@Espyo	mhm!
2016-01-21 20:14:44	@Espyo	oh, it's not on that article
2016-01-21 20:14:48	@Espyo	[[Plasm Wraith#Trivia]] maybe?

2016-01-21 20:14:55	@Espyo	there
2016-01-21 20:15:04	@Espyo	and at least the files say there are TWO bosses
2016-01-21 20:15:06	@Espyo	so that checks out
2016-01-21 20:15:15	@Espyo	I want to plot them, though
2016-01-21 20:15:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-21 20:15:42	ScruffyChat	Perhaps it's an undrawn mysterious life-form
2016-01-21 20:16:23	@Espyo	what the HELL
2016-01-21 20:16:26	@Espyo	it's so far away from everything else
2016-01-21 20:16:29	@Espyo	I can barely see it
2016-01-21 20:17:13	ScruffyChat	brb, good luck with that
2016-01-21 20:19:17	@Espyo	yeah, it's stupidly far away
2016-01-21 20:19:23	@Espyo	 4000.00000000 0.00000000 -5750.00000000
2016-01-21 20:19:24	@Espyo	versus
2016-01-21 20:19:30	@Espyo	-5650.00000000 0.00000000 6330.00000000
2016-01-21 20:20:05	@Espyo	so 9650 units difference on X, 12080 on Z

2016-01-21 20:25:37	ScruffyChat	woah
2016-01-21 20:26:26	ScruffyChat	Must be some secret
2016-01-21 20:26:53	@Espyo	you can only see it with a glitch
2016-01-21 20:28:00	ScruffyChat	the bubble or whatever it is?
2016-01-21 20:29:31	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-21 20:31:27	ScruffyChat	man, what could it be?
2016-01-21 20:31:36	@Espyo	oh, it's definitely the boss again, for sure
2016-01-21 20:31:50	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-21 20:31:50	@Espyo	both that bubble and the Plasm Wraith you see are Metaboss
2016-01-21 20:31:56	@Espyo	question is: why is it there?
2016-01-21 20:33:01	@Espyo	gaaaaaah I can't remember the steps to reproduce the glitch
2016-01-21 20:33:05	@Espyo	we keep talking about on skype
2016-01-21 20:33:09	@Espyo	and I never pointed it down
2016-01-21 20:33:17	@Espyo	I mean, I must have...I just don't know where
2016-01-21 20:36:37	Yoshi2	I'll now try to apply the palette to the image
2016-01-21 20:36:51	@Espyo	good luck
2016-01-21 20:36:51	Yoshi2	there will not be any sleep for me until I fix the colors
2016-01-21 20:41:28	ScruffyChat	Wow, my college adopted an official statement today banning hoverboards from campus until they can be proven not explosive
2016-01-21 20:42:29	Yoshi2	I wish python had an equivalent of struct.unpack that worked with bits
2016-01-21 20:45:26	@Espyo	that sentence was just fine right up until the "explosive" part
2016-01-21 20:45:27	@Espyo	wtf
2016-01-21 20:45:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah, hoverboards aren't very stable
2016-01-21 20:45:47	@Espyo	but exploding?
2016-01-21 20:45:53	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-01-21 20:45:57	ScruffyChat	It's pretty tragic
2016-01-21 20:45:58	@Espyo	are there reports of that?
2016-01-21 20:46:06	@Espyo	what in the world...
2016-01-21 20:46:34	ScruffyChat	I can't remember which is regarded as the 
2016-01-21 20:46:37	ScruffyChat	"safe" brand
2016-01-21 20:46:43	ScruffyChat	But I avoid them anyhow
2016-01-21 20:47:47	@Espyo	geez
2016-01-21 20:48:32	ScruffyChat	I don't understand them either; it's much simpler to walk
2016-01-21 20:50:07	Yoshi2	fixing the colors shouldn't be that hard, but somehow it is
2016-01-21 21:17:04	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/JznbvH2.png this looks almost perfect, but the edges are weird
2016-01-21 21:26:57	@Espyo	looks like problems with alpha

2016-01-21 21:55:05	@Espyo	what the
2016-01-21 21:55:10	@Espyo	Pikmin 3, what are you doing
2016-01-21 21:55:12	@Espyo	you're not Pikmin 2
2016-01-21 21:55:13	@Espyo	stop that
2016-01-21 21:55:27	@Espyo	the path files have a section helpfully commented as "links" and another as "incomings"
2016-01-21 21:55:37	@Espyo	for every node in the graph
2016-01-21 21:55:41	@Espyo	obviously these mark other nodes
2016-01-21 21:55:49	@Espyo	except the incomings should be the nodes that lead INTO it, right?
2016-01-21 21:55:52	@Espyo	turns out it's the opposite
2016-01-21 21:55:59	@Espyo	it's the nodes that this one is pointing to
2016-01-21 22:00:55	@Espyo	or not?
2016-01-21 22:01:53	@Espyo	I'm so confused
2016-01-21 22:02:05	@Espyo	even if I check the list of incomings
2016-01-21 22:02:08	@Espyo	it's still nonsense
2016-01-21 22:02:13	@Espyo	like, it's not nonsense
2016-01-21 22:02:20	@Espyo	but the way the arrows are facing
2016-01-21 22:02:26	@Espyo	makes it so that a lot of nodes are dead ends
2016-01-21 22:02:33	@Espyo	of course, I could've just written the arrow drawing code wrong
2016-01-21 22:02:36	@Espyo	but I didn't
2016-01-21 22:02:43	@Espyo	plus some nodes are not dead ends
2016-01-21 22:02:47	@Espyo	so if I swapped the arrows, they would be
2016-01-21 22:03:01	@Espyo	most nodes are connected to others bidirectionally, so no problem
2016-01-21 22:03:11	@Espyo	but dead ends are being pointed TO, instead of away from
2016-01-21 22:03:18	@Espyo	...SOME of them
2016-01-21 22:03:54	@Espyo	this vase with a 5-Pellet Posy near the landing site of the GOH has a node pointing away from it, to the main path
2016-01-21 22:04:06	@Espyo	and right next to it, in the water, we have a node that's being pointed to by two spots
2016-01-21 22:10:26	@Espyo	I just realized these paths are probably not only carrying paths, but Go Here! paths too
2016-01-21 22:10:29	Testyo	More like /Project Clean Up Sandbox, just ...uh
2016-01-21 22:10:39	@Espyo	which made me realize I can probably implement Go Here! on the engine pretty easily

2016-01-21 22:51:13	@Espyo	they make a point, but to what point should I license software like this?

2016-01-21 23:36:08	Scruffy	Hey Epsyo, any more findings about that extra Plasm Wraith
2016-01-21 23:36:09	Scruffy	?
2016-01-21 23:36:16	@Espyo	not really
2016-01-21 23:36:22	@Espyo	can't reproduce the glitch to free the camera and take a look
2016-01-21 23:36:36	Scruffy	yeah...
2016-01-21 23:36:46	@Espyo	other than that, I realized that the graph that makes up the carrying paths is a bit weird
2016-01-21 23:36:49	@Espyo	there are some dead end nodes
2016-01-21 23:36:54	@Espyo	that instead of pointing towards the main path
2016-01-21 23:36:59	@Espyo	have the main path point to them
2016-01-21 23:37:18	Scruffy	interesting
2016-01-21 23:37:23	@Espyo	I need to understand how these paths relate to Pikmin carrying, Winged Pikmin carrying, and leaders under Go Here!
2016-01-21 23:37:32	@Espyo	otherwise this is just baloney
2016-01-21 23:37:38	@Espyo	well, the graph I have DOES look good
2016-01-21 23:37:42	@Espyo	it's just that the arrows don't make sense
2016-01-21 23:37:48	Scruffy	yeah
2016-01-21 23:38:35	Scruffy	Waypoints were about as far as I ever got in trying to create Pikmin in LittleBigPlanet
2016-01-21 23:38:52	Scruffy	I had two leaders who could whistle each other and switch leadership
2016-01-21 23:39:08	Scruffy	and they could climb ramps, change footstep sounds, and throw each other
2016-01-21 23:39:14	@Espyo	wow, nice
2016-01-21 23:39:20	Scruffy	But waypoints never worked otu
2016-01-21 23:39:47	Scruffy	They always messed with whether leaders considered themselves as "following someone else" or not
2016-01-21 23:40:00	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-21 23:40:06	@Espyo	I've had those kinds of nightmare on the engine too
2016-01-21 23:40:12	@Espyo	before I implemented the finite state machine for their AI
2016-01-21 23:40:21	@Espyo	now, they're either in a "following" state or not
2016-01-21 23:40:33	@Espyo	instead of just having dodgy code to decide if they were following something or not
2016-01-21 23:40:35	@Espyo	dark times...
2016-01-21 23:40:43	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-21 23:41:01	Scruffy	but how do make a hierarchy of what to follow?
2016-01-21 23:41:14	@Espyo	it's only one level high, right?
2016-01-21 23:41:37	@Espyo	there's only one follower, and one follow...ee
2016-01-21 23:41:50	@Espyo	like, you can't have a Pikmin following a leader, that in turn is following a leader
2016-01-21 23:41:57	Scruffy	Right right
2016-01-21 23:42:20	Scruffy	I mean how do you tell a Pikmin what is most important to follow: a leader, a waypoint, a treasure, an enemy, etc.
2016-01-21 23:42:43	@Espyo	depends on the state
2016-01-21 23:43:05	@Espyo	"following_leader", "chasing_enemy", and "chasing_carrying_spot" are actually some of the names of the states Pikmin are using
2016-01-21 23:43:13	@Espyo	...I should probably make them more consistent
2016-01-21 23:43:16	@Espyo	following, chasing...
2016-01-21 23:43:40	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-21 23:43:55	@Espyo	from there it's straight forward, too
2016-01-21 23:44:01	Scruffy	I think that was my problem in LittleBigPlanet
2016-01-21 23:44:02	@Espyo	while in a chasing enemy state, they, well, chase the enemy
2016-01-21 23:44:08	@Espyo	when they get whistled, change state to chasing leader
2016-01-21 23:44:16	@Espyo	when the leader dismisses, change state to idle
2016-01-21 23:44:17	@Espyo	etc.
2016-01-21 23:44:24	Scruffy	I had states set up, but it got confusing connecting them to causal events
2016-01-21 23:44:32	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-21 23:44:36	@Espyo	but yeah, I guess that that's the way to go
2016-01-21 23:44:53	Scruffy	Because LittleBigPlanet means well, but it's programming system is very confusing
2016-01-21 23:45:05	Scruffy	It's all a visual interface rather than programming text
2016-01-21 23:45:13	@Espyo	yikes
2016-01-21 23:45:17	@Espyo	well, that CAN work, if done right
2016-01-21 23:45:30	Scruffy	If you've ever heard of Alic
2016-01-21 23:45:32	Scruffy	Alice
2016-01-21 23:45:36	@Espyo	nope
2016-01-21 23:45:38	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-21 23:46:25	Scruffy	Well it's basically taking a big board that resembles a circuit board and placing circuitry on that board and literally wiring those objects together to make one cause the other
2016-01-21 23:46:36	@Espyo	aww, neat
2016-01-21 23:46:48	Scruffy	And that's how it is in LittleBigPlanet
2016-01-21 23:47:00	Scruffy	But there get to be *so* many wires
2016-01-21 23:47:07	@Espyo	right, right
2016-01-21 23:47:26	Scruffy	I should really learn Allegro or Python or one of those at some point
2016-01-21 23:47:46	@Espyo	well, I can help with Allegro, of course
2016-01-21 23:47:52	Scruffy	Right now it seems harder, but I'm sure it's actually easier
2016-01-21 23:47:56	@Espyo	but if you're not keen on programming, it won't do you any good
2016-01-21 23:48:14	@Espyo	all Allegro does is give you a way to communicate with the operative system in regards to game-related things
2016-01-21 23:48:20	@Espyo	like creating the window and accepting player input
2016-01-21 23:48:24	@Espyo	and drawing to the window
2016-01-21 23:48:27	@Espyo	everything else is done by you
2016-01-21 23:48:38	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-21 23:48:45	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-21 23:49:16	Scruffy	I also have Unity, but it's just collecting dust in my Applications folder
2016-01-21 23:49:21	Scruffy	I need to try that some time
2016-01-21 23:49:26	@Espyo	yeah, give it a whirl
2016-01-21 23:49:43	Scruffy	Oh! Speaking of game making
2016-01-21 23:50:00	Scruffy	I've been testing one number that changes what kind of enemy spawns in an area
2016-01-21 23:50:05	Scruffy	The order is not Piklopedia
2016-01-21 23:50:24	Scruffy	En_Passant suggested it was the order enemy mobs were created and programmed
2016-01-21 23:50:54	@Espyo	wait wait, what?
2016-01-21 23:51:04	@Espyo	"one number that changes what kind of enemy spawns"?
2016-01-21 23:51:09	Scruffy	Yep
2016-01-21 23:51:17	@Espyo	can you elaborate?
2016-01-21 23:51:39	Scruffy	In Abe's folder, under "map," there are txt files that spawn objects in the above-ground areas
2016-01-21 23:51:55	Scruffy	Like defaultgen, and initgen, and all those files you know in Pikmin 3
2016-01-21 23:52:00	@Espyo	right
2016-01-21 23:52:51	Scruffy	In each file (I'm using the one 1-4.txt for the Valley of Repose) there are a number of generators
2016-01-21 23:53:01	Scruffy	And the ones labeled "teki" are enemies
2016-01-21 23:53:28	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-01-21 23:53:33	Scruffy	So take that stupid Red Bulborb on the sewer lid I'm still fussing about
2016-01-21 23:53:58	Scruffy	It has a parameter "# teki" that is set to 1, making it a Red Bulborb
2016-01-21 23:54:07	Scruffy	0 is a Pellet Posy, 2 is a Dwarf RB
2016-01-21 23:54:18	Scruffy	19 is a falling rock, 20 is a fire geyser
2016-01-21 23:54:22	Scruffy	and I'm still going
2016-01-21 23:54:27	@Espyo	yikes
2016-01-21 23:54:46	Scruffy	Yeah, I have no idea what this order is supposed to be
2016-01-21 23:54:49	Scruffy	But it's intriguing
2016-01-21 23:55:22	Scruffy	It seems that with this and the order of treasures in the English script text files, the developers came up with lists on the spot
2016-01-21 23:55:27	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_2_enemy_properties/Page_1 this might help
2016-01-21 23:55:57	Scruffy	I think this is one parameter we haven't accounted for yet
2016-01-21 23:56:09	Scruffy	It's not alphabetical by creature name or internal name
2016-01-21 23:56:17	@Espyo	darn
2016-01-21 23:56:23	@Espyo	at least the list should be that
2016-01-21 23:56:34	@Espyo	you mentioned fire geysers and boulders, and they're on the list
2016-01-21 23:56:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-21 23:56:52	Scruffy	I need to keep going up the integer scale
2016-01-21 23:56:55	@Espyo	I have an inkling that there's a file somewhere that lists all mobs, and their numbers
2016-01-21 23:57:02	@Espyo	P2 has a LOT of files, so maybe...
2016-01-21 23:57:03	Scruffy	It's fun, it's like a gashapon machine
2016-01-21 23:57:20	Scruffy	I put in a quarter and get a random enemy
2016-01-21 23:57:23	@Espyo	heheh
2016-01-21 23:57:36	@Espyo	oh, tried /enemy/enemyResList.txt yet?
2016-01-21 23:57:57	@Espyo	try also /user/Abe/Pellet/*/carcass_config.txt
2016-01-21 23:58:58	Scruffy	Reslist is reverse alphabetical
2016-01-21 23:59:04	@Espyo	|: that's dumb
2016-01-21 23:59:23	Scruffy	And carcass_config is in yet another order because Olimar is included and not all enemies leave carcasses
2016-01-21 23:59:38	@Espyo	right...
2016-01-22 00:00:09	Scruffy	What I'd really like to find is upgrades
2016-01-22 00:00:13	Scruffy	I've found /some/
2016-01-22 00:00:27	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-22 00:00:32	Scruffy	But only the ones that affect leaders themselves; they're in leader parameters
2016-01-22 00:00:59	Scruffy	I feel like the treasure files for the Explorer's Friend series could actually affect that, but I'm not sure
2016-01-22 00:01:05	@Espyo	gotta love lines like "2 		# 0:point 1:circle"
2016-01-22 00:01:10	@Espyo	that's the second enemy on AW
2016-01-22 00:01:13	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-22 00:01:17	Scruffy	I have no idea
2016-01-22 00:01:38	Scruffy	I did notice something silly though
2016-01-22 00:01:44	@Espyo	and what about appear radius? and enemy size?
2016-01-22 00:01:50	@Espyo	good grief, this needs to be looked at
2016-01-22 00:01:51	Scruffy	If the Red Bulborb I mentioned became a Pellet Posy
2016-01-22 00:01:57	Scruffy	It would only be blue
2016-01-22 00:02:05	@Espyo	I'll try to add P2 files to the plotter, too
2016-01-22 00:02:05	Scruffy	Even though blues weren't discovered yet
2016-01-22 00:02:13	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-22 00:02:23	Scruffy	And it would /still/ leave three 5 pellets behind when defeated
2016-01-22 00:02:30	Scruffy	Because of the data the Red Bulborb had
2016-01-22 00:02:31	@Espyo	wait, what
2016-01-22 00:02:39	@Espyo	you get the Pellet Posy's HP to 0
2016-01-22 00:02:42	@Espyo	and it spits out 4 pellets?
2016-01-22 00:02:46	Scruffy	Yep
2016-01-22 00:02:49	@Espyo	that's amazing!
2016-01-22 00:02:52	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-22 00:02:53	@Espyo	you have to make a gif of that
2016-01-22 00:02:58	@Espyo	and I have to get going
2016-01-22 00:03:08	Scruffy	Ah right
2016-01-22 00:03:12	Scruffy	See ya
2016-01-22 00:03:16	Scruffy	Have a good night

2016-01-22 19:00:57	@J	feels a little like it's a bitmask?
2016-01-22 19:01:04	@J	0*2^0 + 1*2^1
2016-01-22 19:01:11	@J	complete guess, really
2016-01-22 19:03:54	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-01-22 19:03:57	@Espyo	bitmask makes sense
2016-01-22 19:04:05	@Espyo	I mean, I don't know what that parameter even is
2016-01-22 19:04:11	@Espyo	maybe it's like saying a point is also a circle
2016-01-22 19:04:14	@Espyo	so no, it doesn't make sense
2016-01-22 19:04:19	@Espyo	but at least it justifies a 2

2016-01-22 19:06:16	@Espyo	thoughts?
2016-01-22 19:16:31	@J	do you have any Nintendo assets in your repo?
2016-01-22 19:16:34	@J	I don't think you do
2016-01-22 19:16:42	@J	in which case, it's all yours, you can license it as you please
2016-01-22 19:17:06	@J	...also I just realised you never closed my pull request from forever ago
2016-01-22 19:17:24	@Espyo	I have some textures from P2
2016-01-22 19:17:28	@Espyo	those can be replaced, though
2016-01-22 19:17:32	@Espyo	all right, seems fair, I guess
2016-01-22 19:17:39	@Espyo	also I have no idea what a pull request is, so it makes sense
2016-01-22 19:17:44	@Espyo	thank you, btw
2016-01-22 19:18:40	@J	I mean, it was just my compilation fixes, I think you just applied them yourself

2016-01-22 19:19:15	@Espyo	shouldn't that be a PUSH request?
2016-01-22 19:19:20	@Espyo	people are requesting that this code they wrote gets pushed
2016-01-22 19:19:32	@J	they request that you pull it
2016-01-22 19:19:47	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-22 19:19:50	@Espyo	I...suppose
2016-01-22 19:20:15	@J	like rfc
2016-01-22 19:20:20	@J	you request others make comments
2016-01-22 19:20:27	@Espyo	hm, that's new
2016-01-22 19:20:42	@J	it's a term used on some wikis
2016-01-22 19:20:45	@Espyo	sounds neat
2016-01-22 19:20:47	@J	when discussing policy stuff
2016-01-22 19:20:58	@J	basically our policy page, we just don't call it rfc

2016-01-22 20:38:58	@Espyo	I was just thinking of you
2016-01-22 20:39:14	@Espyo	how good are you with bump maps, normal maps, etc.?
2016-01-22 20:40:38	Scruffy	I'm good with bump maps, I'm still figuring out normal maps
2016-01-22 20:40:57	Yoshi2	Espyo: I figured out the alpha issues in the palette format, and I'm now hacking away at trying to do a dxt1 decoder
2016-01-22 20:41:22	Yoshi2	dxt1 is such a weird texture compression algorithm
2016-01-22 20:41:24	@Espyo	well, can you at least identify what's what?
2016-01-22 20:41:28	@Espyo	plus other types of similar textures?
2016-01-22 20:41:38	Yoshi2	not yet :/
2016-01-22 20:41:45	@Espyo	Yoshi2: so those jagged things were alpha, then?
2016-01-22 20:42:00	@Espyo	...I was talking to Scruffy, but the question is 100% valid for you too
2016-01-22 20:42:01	@Espyo	amazing
2016-01-22 20:42:29	Yoshi2	yup, jagged thingies were me incorrectly decoding pixels that use alpha
2016-01-22 20:42:32	Scruffy	normal mapping textures are just an implementation of bump mapping
2016-01-22 20:42:39	Scruffy	Yes I could identify
2016-01-22 20:42:54	@Espyo	hm, right

2016-01-22 20:43:18	Scruffy	Sure
2016-01-22 20:43:26	@Espyo	plus as a bonus, you keep the textures, which will be useful
2016-01-22 20:43:34	@Espyo	since they're the Red Bulborb and Orange Bulborb
2016-01-22 20:43:54	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-01-22 20:45:46	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Bulborb%20textures.zip good luck
2016-01-22 20:47:06	Scruffy	Okay, so which one am I looking at
2016-01-22 20:47:16	@Espyo	all of them
2016-01-22 20:47:27	@Espyo	the Orange Bulborb is packed alongside the Red Bulborb in the game's files
2016-01-22 20:47:33	@Espyo	those are the textures in that "pack"
2016-01-22 20:47:33	Scruffy	Okay
2016-01-22 20:47:49	@Espyo	the two enemies share the same model, so it makes sense that they'd just bundle them together
2016-01-22 20:48:02	@Espyo	I guess you can skip the obvious stuff like the regular textures
2016-01-22 20:48:03	Scruffy	circle_nrm.gtx.png is the normal map of the Bulborb's spots
2016-01-22 20:48:09	@Espyo	right
2016-01-22 20:48:20	Scruffy	circle_scm.gtx is a specular map I belive
2016-01-22 20:48:23	Scruffy	believe
2016-01-22 20:48:58	Scruffy	Yes, the "scm" ones are specular maps
2016-01-22 20:49:39	@Espyo	...that settles that then
2016-01-22 20:49:44	Scruffy	That is, they filter specular highlights
2016-01-22 20:49:55	@Espyo	hmm, I really need to know better how specular maps work
2016-01-22 20:50:33	@Espyo	what the?
2016-01-22 20:50:42	@Espyo	I managed to create the "dump area into image" feature
2016-01-22 20:50:48	@Espyo	and it worked fine straight away
2016-01-22 20:50:50	@Espyo	on the first test
2016-01-22 20:50:57	@Espyo	well, the leaf shadows are off, but

2016-01-22 20:52:06	@Espyo	it's weird that I got it right the first time
2016-01-22 20:52:21	@Espyo	since a lot of the calculations I used to center things and stuff are guesswork

2016-01-22 20:53:12	@Espyo	no complaints, actually the opposite
2016-01-22 20:53:18	@Espyo	I made a feature to take a screenshot of the whole area
2016-01-22 20:53:26	@Espyo	and it somehow worked almost entirely fine first try

2016-01-22 20:58:32	En_Passant	There's a journal on the website that reflects my progress
2016-01-22 20:59:22	@Espyo	right, right
2016-01-22 20:59:43	Yoshi2	dxt1 encodes 4x4 pixels in 8 bytes, which explains why all the images I checked used half as many bytes as the dimensions would suggest
2016-01-22 20:59:53	En_Passant	I don't think I've published the most current one, though
2016-01-22 20:59:54	En_Passant	That's due today, so I'm glad you mentioned it
2016-01-22 21:00:02	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yeah
2016-01-22 21:01:16	Yoshi2	but I am not sure how to correctly decode the images
2016-01-22 21:01:31	Yoshi2	I think I am correctly decoding each 4x4 block, but it still ends up looking like binary vomit
2016-01-22 21:01:44	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/hfqf1s6.png
2016-01-22 21:02:49	@Espyo	yikes
2016-01-22 21:02:57	Scruffy	More like a binary butterfly
2016-01-22 21:03:03	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-22 21:03:05	@Espyo	for sure a butterfly
2016-01-22 21:03:27	Yoshi2	this is actually one of the more recognizable images
2016-01-22 21:03:33	Yoshi2	others, less so

2016-01-22 21:05:12	@Espyo	looks like a magic eye picture, almost
2016-01-22 21:05:49	Yoshi2	I couldn't make anything as random as this even if I tried
2016-01-22 21:06:05	Yoshi2	the most random stuff happens when I incorrectly do non-random stuff
2016-01-22 21:06:22	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-22 21:09:54	En_Passant	Isn't there a way to quickly get a capture of a program window?
2016-01-22 21:09:54	En_Passant	(not related to the decoder)
2016-01-22 21:11:33	@Espyo	you press the print screen key
2016-01-22 21:11:46	En_Passant	Doesn't that capture everything on the screen?
2016-01-22 21:11:58	@Espyo	oh, alt+print screen
2016-01-22 21:12:02	@Espyo	that captures just the current window
2016-01-22 21:12:06	@Espyo	but it catches the border and title bar too
2016-01-22 21:12:08	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2016-01-22 21:12:50	En_Passant	thanks

2016-01-22 21:51:33	@J	I'm sure it looked better before
2016-01-22 21:51:44	@J	when it was greyscale
2016-01-22 21:53:16	Yoshi2	J: yup, but the greyscale one is separate from this one
2016-01-22 21:53:31	Yoshi2	this one uses dxt1 and should be in color when I'm done with it
2016-01-22 21:57:05	Yoshi2	hmmm, this is very frustrating

2016-01-22 22:27:07	En_Passant	oh yeah
2016-01-22 22:27:15	En_Passant	then the lawyers entered the room

2016-01-22 22:30:40	StarWolf	anyways, we had the idea down, but still needed a name and how to defeat it.
2016-01-22 22:34:05	En_Passant	How to defeat it?
2016-01-22 22:36:02	StarWolf	Yah.... I don't want a throw-pikmin-at-it-until-it-dies thing. I want more skill then pressing A rapidly, ya know?
2016-01-22 22:37:05	En_Passant	What types of Pikmin do you have when you encounter it?

2016-01-22 22:47:32	StarWolf	Well, I was thinking that you could use the second character as a pikmin (sorta) but it's bad enough that I borrowed the character idea from scruffy.... I don't want to take the mechanics along with him as well... 
2016-01-22 22:48:38	En_Passant	Borrowed it from Scruffy?
2016-01-22 22:49:01	StarWolf	the second character is Loumin....

2016-01-23 01:13:23	@PikFan	anyway, so there was another NX leak today
2016-01-23 01:13:37	Scruffy	Really!
2016-01-23 01:13:41	@PikFan	apparently it'll run at 900p/60fps
2016-01-23 01:13:46	Scruffy	Woah
2016-01-23 01:13:52	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-23 01:14:10	Scruffy	a leak? or did nintendo plan to give it away?
2016-01-23 01:14:15	@PikFan	but that makes no sense, because the Wii U already runs at 1080p/60fps
2016-01-23 01:14:24	@PikFan	it was a leak
2016-01-23 01:14:42	Neocraftz1553	they DID say it was handheld...ish
2016-01-23 01:14:57	Scruffy	??
2016-01-23 01:14:57	@PikFan	oh, for the handheld part
2016-01-23 01:15:04	Neocraftz1553	I remwmber seeing something about that
2016-01-23 01:15:05	@PikFan	hmm okay
2016-01-23 01:15:23	@PikFan	Scruffy, I'll grab a link
2016-01-23 01:15:44	@PikFan	http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/221699-nintendo-nx-console-leak-points-to-high-frame-rates-900p-resolution
2016-01-23 01:16:21	@PikFan	but yeah, I don't see why they're freaking out over 60fps, because the Wii U ALREADY DOES THAT
2016-01-23 01:16:43	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-01-23 01:19:10	@PikFan	it's looking to be an interesting console for sure
2016-01-23 01:19:25	Scruffy	Is the GamePad at 60 fps on the Wii U?
2016-01-23 01:19:34	@PikFan	yes
2016-01-23 01:19:46	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-23 01:19:55	@PikFan	so technically, the Wii U is running 120 fps
2016-01-23 01:20:40	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-23 01:20:51	Scruffy	After 60 I really can't tell the difference
2016-01-23 01:21:09	@PikFan	same
2016-01-23 01:21:26	@PikFan	must be why it's 60
2016-01-23 01:21:41	Scruffy	And actually I find curved screens and 4k to be a worse experience than regular HD
2016-01-23 01:22:17	@PikFan	heh, really? I've never seen a 4k screen in person
2016-01-23 01:22:48	@PikFan	I've heard that some people get headaches from 4k
2016-01-23 01:23:02	Scruffy	It's more detail than your eyes see in real life
2016-01-23 01:23:16	En_Passant	Go visit my mom and wind up napping for an hour
2016-01-23 01:23:22	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-01-23 01:24:41	Scruffy	Hi
2016-01-23 01:24:57	Neocraftz1553	I remember when P3 was announced
2016-01-23 01:25:10	Neocraftz1553	It's graphics blew my mind
2016-01-23 01:25:16	Neocraftz1553	it still kinda does
2016-01-23 01:25:38	@PikFan	Pikmin 5 for NX
2016-01-23 01:26:04	Neocraftz1553	P5 konfermid?¿?¿?
2016-01-23 01:26:07	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-23 01:26:11	Neocraftz1553	but most likely
2016-01-23 01:26:21	Neocraftz1553	like P1 and P2
2016-01-23 01:26:58	Scruffy	VR Pikmin
2016-01-23 01:27:48	Neocraftz1553	that would be cool
2016-01-23 01:27:52	@PikFan	I'd actually like AR Pikmin
2016-01-23 01:28:15	@PikFan	you get to actually control Pikmin in the real world
2016-01-23 01:29:00	Neocraftz1553	that would be awsome

2016-01-23 01:29:22	Neocraftz1553	especially if you could somehow make them interact with real world options
2016-01-23 01:29:35	@PikFan	yes, exactly
2016-01-23 01:30:05	Neocraftz1553	that would help the fanon alot
2016-01-23 01:30:19	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-23 01:31:09	Neocraftz1553	Users could "research" how pikmin react to the enviroment and get the approximate weight of an object.
2016-01-23 01:31:22	Scruffy	Makes me think, Pikmin would make a good stop action movie
2016-01-23 01:31:41	En_Passant	You mean stop motion?
2016-01-23 01:31:47	Neocraftz1553	hehe

2016-01-23 01:32:41	Scruffy	oops, yes
2016-01-23 01:32:51	Scruffy	heh i mixed "stop motion" and "live action"
2016-01-23 01:32:59	@PikFan	following P2's clay art style? that could work
2016-01-23 01:33:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-23 01:33:16	Scruffy	Or Pikmin 3's... 3D printed style

2016-01-23 01:36:54	Neocraftz1553	I've seen other users implement this, but online multiplayer with other people
2016-01-23 01:37:51	Scruffy	The problem is Pikmin is historically strict about only 100 Pikmin programmed at once
2016-01-23 01:38:07	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-23 01:38:16	Scruffy	If every player got 100 Pikmin, or even 50 like in 2-P Battle/Bingo Battle, the console would have a fit

2016-01-23 07:47:35	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-23 07:47:44	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-01-23 07:47:53	Neocraftz1553	it is getting kinda late over here
2016-01-23 07:48:00	En_Passant	Here too
2016-01-23 07:49:05	Neocraftz1553	Do you mind checking out an enemy mechanics article I made for my game??

2016-01-23 07:49:22	En_Passant	I already looked at that
2016-01-23 07:49:23	Neocraftz1553	Give me some feedback please
2016-01-23 07:49:25	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-23 07:49:36	Neocraftz1553	so, what did you think of it:
2016-01-23 07:49:39	Neocraftz1553	*?
2016-01-23 07:49:52	Neocraftz1553	Sorry, Im a little drowsy
2016-01-23 07:49:52	En_Passant	It's a good idea, but it doesn't seem like it will be usable very often
2016-01-23 07:50:08	Neocraftz1553	nah, its only for my own game
2016-01-23 07:50:36	En_Passant	You need an enemy and the hazard in a close vicinity, and then you have to lure the enemy into the hazard without also hitting it yourself
2016-01-23 07:51:00	Neocraftz1553	yeah, that could work
2016-01-23 07:51:12	Neocraftz1553	but it also happens in other ways
2016-01-23 07:51:27	Neocraftz1553	like a bulborb pathfinding its way back to its spawn
2016-01-23 07:51:33	Neocraftz1553	I forgot to add that
2016-01-23 07:52:20	Neocraftz1553	there will be different pathfinding AI for different enemies

2016-01-23 12:27:05	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-23 12:27:05	Testyo	no, the way you guys are thinking is a literal madhouse
2016-01-23 12:27:40	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-23 12:31:41	Yoshi2	Espyo: after doing a bit of dark, voodoo magic I finally managed to parse the dxt data somewhat correctly
2016-01-23 12:31:51	@Espyo	somewhat
2016-01-23 12:31:55	@Espyo	still not quite there yet, then?
2016-01-23 12:32:34	Yoshi2	it's mostly fine
2016-01-23 12:33:23	Yoshi2	on some data it's a bit off, but I'm tired of doing work on this
2016-01-23 12:33:54	@Espyo	I get you
2016-01-23 12:34:47	Yoshi2	I had to switch around the endianness on some of the values
2016-01-23 12:38:15	@Espyo	ah
2016-01-23 12:41:58	@J	Testyo's used that 'is a literal madhouse' line 3 times now
2016-01-23 12:41:59	Testyo	I wouldn't recommend Purples though
2016-01-23 12:42:36	Yoshi2	here is an example of where it looks a bit off: https://i.imgur.com/fByjdYG.png
2016-01-23 12:42:43	Yoshi2	here is one example where it looks fine: https://i.imgur.com/8H6gPdk.png
2016-01-23 12:43:17	@Espyo	I did all I could in regards to the RNG
2016-01-23 12:43:19	@Espyo	not my fault any more
2016-01-23 12:43:35	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2016-01-23 12:44:32	Yoshi2	and here is a thing I am very proud of: https://i.imgur.com/2oXIxAs.png https://i.imgur.com/5M6Ve7I.png
2016-01-23 12:45:09	Yoshi2	I've read that battalion wars was supposed to have APCs, but this is definite proof that they were planned and not just a fan invention
2016-01-23 12:46:00	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-01-23 12:46:00	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-23 12:48:14	@J	are those missing bits actually grey, or transparent?
2016-01-23 12:48:21	@Espyo	I thought that too
2016-01-23 12:48:23	@J	if transparent maybe there's an implicit background colour
2016-01-23 12:48:25	@Espyo	but they look gray
2016-01-23 12:50:37	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Talk:Goolix#goolixs_are_kinda_cute I remember this guy
2016-01-23 12:51:10	@Espyo	:|
2016-01-23 12:52:42	Yoshi2	well, the APCs are definitely not a fan invention because they are in this gallery of a guy who I think did work on Battalion Wars
2016-01-23 12:52:44	Yoshi2	http://www.gavinrothery.com/battalion-wars/battalion-wars-kuju/10954372
2016-01-23 12:52:49	Yoshi2	http://www.gavinrothery.com/battalion-wars/battalion-wars-kuju/10954435
2016-01-23 12:53:18	Yoshi2	just nice to see some ingame confirmation, but sad that (at least the first game) doesn't have anything else remaining from them
2016-01-23 12:53:33	Yoshi2	so I might do some work on BW2
2016-01-23 12:53:40	Yoshi2	which has a whole new bunch of formats, ughh
2016-01-23 12:56:41	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-23 12:57:49	@Espyo	so I opened two shortcuts to files in a different folder yesterday
2016-01-23 12:58:02	@Espyo	and now that new folder is on my "most used" list
2016-01-23 12:58:23	@Espyo	on the taskbar, if you have the explorer "application" pinned, you can right-click to get a list of the "most used" folders, so you can go there right away
2016-01-23 12:58:38	@Espyo	opening two files that aren't even in that folder apparently makes you a maniac that's head over heels about that folder
2016-01-23 12:59:01	@Espyo	(well, the SHORTCUTS aren't on that folder)
2016-01-23 13:01:29	Yoshi2	I added my git folder as a shortcut
2016-01-23 13:06:24	Yoshi2	but yeah, that is very weird
2016-01-23 13:06:58	Yoshi2	I am very hyped about doing work in BW2
2016-01-23 13:07:08	Yoshi2	if it has unused units, I want to find them
2016-01-23 13:07:26	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-23 13:09:53	Yoshi2	I will need new tools for wii games though
2016-01-23 14:32:20	Yoshi2	Espyo: do you know where I can read about how to run folders in dolphin?
2016-01-23 14:32:27	Yoshi2	google seems to be completely useless
2016-01-23 14:32:53	@Espyo	I don't think there's any info about it online
2016-01-23 14:32:56	@Espyo	but I think it's simple
2016-01-23 14:33:01	@Espyo	IF you're lucky enough for it to work right
2016-01-23 14:33:08	@Espyo	you just dump the full game into a folder
2016-01-23 14:33:17	@Espyo	and in that folder, there should also be a boot.dol file
2016-01-23 14:33:25	@Espyo	on Dolphin, go on File/Open DOL or something of the sort
2016-01-23 14:33:27	@Espyo	and there you go
2016-01-23 14:33:35	@Espyo	you might need to set something up on the main settings
2016-01-23 14:33:48	@Espyo	I think there's a field to set the game folder
2016-01-23 14:43:08	Yoshi2	hm, bw2 for the wii doesn't seem to have a boot.dol file
2016-01-23 14:43:15	Yoshi2	it only has an apploader
2016-01-23 14:44:42	@Espyo	what about an .elf file?
2016-01-23 14:46:13	Yoshi2	maybe I didn't export the files correctly
2016-01-23 14:46:53	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-23 14:46:55	@Espyo	maybe you have to create it?
2016-01-23 14:47:06	@Espyo	ugh, last time I tried this was months ago, and I stopped trying, because Pikmin 2 doesn't work for me
2016-01-23 14:47:19	@Espyo	European Pikmin 2 refuses to load, and US Pikmin 2 is all messed up with the save files
2016-01-23 14:48:47	Yoshi2	I don't think creating an elf file is an easy feat
2016-01-23 14:49:08	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-23 14:49:12	@Espyo	ok, let me check my folder
2016-01-23 14:49:29	@Espyo	I have a boot.dol in there
2016-01-23 14:49:35	@Espyo	and an apploader.img
2016-01-23 14:49:52	@Espyo	so if Dolphin doesn't create the automatically when you export...
2016-01-23 14:49:56	@Espyo	there has to be another way
2016-01-23 14:50:00	@Espyo	I don't remember doing any wizardry to get those files
2016-01-23 14:50:44	Yoshi2	seems like it's not worth it then
2016-01-23 14:51:00	Yoshi2	it kinda works with my gamecube games somehow
2016-01-23 14:51:15	@Espyo	yeah, there's not even a guarantee it'll work
2016-01-23 14:54:07	Yoshi2	wiimms tools it is then
2016-01-23 14:54:24	@Espyo	'fraid so

2016-01-23 16:43:32	Yoshi2	pretty good
2016-01-23 16:44:30	Yoshi2	I figured out dxt1 pretty much completely
2016-01-23 16:44:39	Scruffy	Nice
2016-01-23 16:44:40	@Espyo	terrific
2016-01-23 16:44:45	@Espyo	here we have windows ruining everything
2016-01-23 16:44:45	@Espyo	AGAIN
2016-01-23 16:45:05	@Espyo	if you run the engine on Linux by just double clicking the executable
2016-01-23 16:45:08	@Espyo	you run it without a console
2016-01-23 16:45:12	@Espyo	and any console output is ignored
2016-01-23 16:45:20	@Espyo	if you run it from the command line, the command line receives console output
2016-01-23 16:45:27	@Espyo	under windows, if you double click the executable, there's no console
2016-01-23 16:45:32	@Espyo	if you run it from the command line...
2016-01-23 16:45:38	@Espyo	it completely ignores console output just the same
2016-01-23 16:45:51	@Espyo	so under windows, my only options are to have a console 100% of the time, or to have no console output whatsoever
2016-01-23 16:45:55	@Espyo	conclusion
2016-01-23 16:46:06	@Espyo	I'm going to have to create my own fucking thing to print out information, thanks to windows
2016-01-23 16:46:21	@Espyo	either that, or make it so that everybody gets a nice big console window whenever they run the engine under windows

2016-01-23 16:50:56	Yoshi2	the only thing left in BW on the GC is model formats, but I don't think I will find anything interesting there
2016-01-23 16:51:10	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-23 16:51:53	Yoshi2	I found icons for two cut units which I am very hyped about, but didn't find any textures belonging to them in the decoded DXT data
2016-01-23 16:52:00	Yoshi2	so maybe BW2 has something
2016-01-23 16:52:05	Yoshi2	although chances are that it doesn't
2016-01-23 16:52:15	Yoshi2	meh, still going to take the chance
2016-01-23 16:59:05	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'm either stupid or I have no idea what I should do with wiimms tools to create a new iso from a folder
2016-01-23 16:59:46	@Espyo	I didn't know wiimms tools allowed you to create a new ISO
2016-01-23 16:59:53	@Espyo	you're just trying to replace files, right?
2016-01-23 17:00:02	Yoshi2	yes
2016-01-23 17:00:08	@Espyo	use J's GCEdit
2016-01-23 17:00:22	@Espyo	which is in a link that he will post as soon as he reads this message and finds it
2016-01-23 17:00:30	Yoshi2	does j's gcedit work with wii images?
2016-01-23 17:00:42	@Espyo	hm, I'm not sure...
2016-01-23 17:00:56	@Espyo	http://ikn.org.uk/GCEdit guess not
2016-01-23 17:01:09	@J	images?
2016-01-23 17:01:11	@J	in what sense?
2016-01-23 17:01:16	@Espyo	ISOs
2016-01-23 17:01:16	Yoshi2	iso
2016-01-23 17:01:18	@J	oh, I didn't read the word Wii
2016-01-23 17:01:25	@J	just completely skipped it
2016-01-23 17:01:29	@J	no, it doesn't
2016-01-23 17:01:42	@J	I never looked into it, but I guess they're probably not very different
2016-01-23 17:01:53	@J	if you ever come across a spec, that would be great
2016-01-23 17:02:46	@J	the only Windows download is here anyway http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/ but still the same buggy version
2016-01-23 17:03:43	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-23 17:04:53	Yoshi2	ok, I might have to extract the image with wiimms tools to be able to make a new image out of it
2016-01-23 17:10:24	Yoshi2	what the hell, windows
2016-01-23 17:10:32	Yoshi2	I can delete all the files inside a folder
2016-01-23 17:10:37	Yoshi2	but I cannot delete the folder itself
2016-01-23 17:10:45	Yoshi2	because some program has it open
2016-01-23 17:12:02	@Espyo	typical
2016-01-23 17:12:19	@Espyo	start closing your processes till it lets you
2016-01-23 17:12:26	Yoshi2	no windows, I can assure you, no program has this folder open
2016-01-23 17:13:30	@Espyo	it's like a 5-year old
2016-01-23 17:13:32	@Espyo	it WILL have its way
2016-01-23 17:13:52	Yoshi2	ugh, where is process monitor when I need it
2016-01-23 17:14:16	Yoshi2	I need to see which program has the folder open
2016-01-23 17:15:19	Yoshi2	conime.exe
2016-01-23 17:15:24	Yoshi2	the fuck is conime.exe
2016-01-23 17:15:25	Testyo	Weren't you told not to swear? That's rude!
2016-01-23 17:16:02	Yoshi2	Well, issue solved
2016-01-23 17:16:22	Yoshi2	I had no consoles open so I am not sure why it has the handle open on that thing
2016-01-23 17:18:14	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-23 17:22:22	Yoshi2	ok, wiimms tool managed to grab the boot.dol from the game
2016-01-23 17:22:42	@Espyo	oh, there yuo go
2016-01-23 17:22:45	@Espyo	*you
2016-01-23 17:22:48	@Espyo	try it now then
2016-01-23 17:23:44	Yoshi2	I guess there was more to the game's files than what I could see in dolphin
2016-01-23 17:24:23	@Espyo	I must've done something of the sort too, then
2016-01-23 17:25:30	Yoshi2	black screen of death
2016-01-23 17:25:44	Yoshi2	meh, can't be bothered to figure that out
2016-01-23 17:25:49	Yoshi2	I will just rebuild the image
2016-01-23 17:26:29	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-23 17:27:24	Yoshi2	ok, so if you want to build a new image from files on the HDD with wiimms tools, you need to use the same tools to extract the files from the ISO to the HDD
2016-01-23 17:27:30	Yoshi2	because it does some weird stuff
2016-01-23 17:27:48	Yoshi2	stuff that dolphin doesn't do when you extract the files
2016-01-23 17:29:37	Yoshi2	takes quite a while to rebuild

2016-01-23 18:00:34	@J	looks like Wii disks start similar to GCN disks, then define partitions
2016-01-23 18:00:45	@J	each partition is the same as a whole GCN disk, once decrypted
2016-01-23 18:02:33	Yoshi2	second time's a charm, it seems
2016-01-23 18:02:50	Yoshi2	worked now, woohoo
2016-01-23 18:10:47	Yoshi2	the APCs are alive and well in BW2

2016-01-23 18:20:58	Yoshi2	I can read it well enough with a hex editor
2016-01-23 18:32:14	En_Passant	Did you check out the Treasure Hold, Scruffy?
2016-01-23 18:35:01	Scruffy	Yes! It looks great
2016-01-23 18:35:20	Scruffy	And I'd be happy to help with some missing info
2016-01-23 18:36:44	Scruffy	One thing I'd like to suggest first, just for clarity
2016-01-23 18:36:56	Scruffy	the "Rack" could be called a "gear rack"
2016-01-23 18:37:13	Scruffy	I wasn't sure it was part of a rack and pinion when I first saw it
2016-01-23 18:37:45	En_Passant	That's a good idea
2016-01-23 18:38:28	En_Passant	It's too bad there's not enough room to include Olimar's Notes and the Sales Pitches on that page
2016-01-23 18:38:36	En_Passant	I have some good ones
2016-01-23 18:38:49	Scruffy	I look forward to it
2016-01-23 18:39:11	Scruffy	But for now, I'm afraid those normally just go on the individual treasure pages
2016-01-23 18:45:51	Yoshi2	I will either hit the jackpot in terms of unused units in BW2, or I will be utterly disappointed by how well they cleaned up the files
2016-01-23 18:46:23	Yoshi2	with the latter being more likely than the former
2016-01-23 18:46:39	@Espyo	this is too much fun
2016-01-23 18:46:49	@Espyo	I added a debugging feature to teleport the current leader to wherever the cursor is
2016-01-23 18:46:57	Scruffy	Woah
2016-01-23 18:47:05	@Espyo	and I made it so you can hold the key down to repeatedly trigger these debugging features
2016-01-23 18:47:09	@Espyo	so if I hold down the key...
2016-01-23 18:47:10	Scruffy	If only that were a non-debugging feature in PIkmin
2016-01-23 18:47:13	@Espyo	I just go flying everywhere
2016-01-23 18:47:18	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-23 18:47:24	@Espyo	it's insanely useful
2016-01-23 18:47:27	@Espyo	I can finally make Louie normal again
2016-01-23 18:47:36	Scruffy	Noooo...
2016-01-23 18:47:43	@Espyo	...oops
2016-01-23 18:47:46	Scruffy	Fast Louie was fun
2016-01-23 18:47:46	@Espyo	I must've pressed the wrong key
2016-01-23 18:47:49	@Espyo	I ended up killing Olimar
2016-01-23 18:47:58	@Espyo	you can get Fast Louie back by just holding the teleport button
2016-01-23 18:48:02	@Espyo	just don't put the cursor too far
2016-01-23 18:48:04	@Espyo	otherwise you go TOO FAST
2016-01-23 18:48:21	@Espyo	what other debugging tools would be helpful?
2016-01-23 18:48:28	@Espyo	I've got the ability to dump the entire area onto an image
2016-01-23 18:48:35	@Espyo	write the current mouse coordinates
2016-01-23 18:48:40	@Espyo	hurt the mob under the cursor
2016-01-23 18:48:46	@Espyo	show a lot of info about the mob under the cursor
2016-01-23 18:48:50	@Espyo	teleport to the cursor
2016-01-23 18:48:53	@Espyo	and that's all for now
2016-01-23 18:52:38	Scruffy	Do bottomless pits function?
2016-01-23 18:52:53	@Espyo	not yet
2016-01-23 18:53:03	@Espyo	I'll try to add them for the next version
2016-01-23 18:53:24	Scruffy	Okay
2016-01-23 18:53:29	Scruffy	Cool!
2016-01-23 18:53:51	@Espyo	a friend suggested a button to add a Pikmin
2016-01-23 18:53:53	@Espyo	pretty good idea
2016-01-23 19:03:41	Yoshi2	I am very sad that battalion wars seems to be so unpopular that finding information about unused/cut units is a pain to find or the info is nonexistant
2016-01-23 19:03:56	@Espyo	yeah, sucks
2016-01-23 19:04:17	Yoshi2	it doesn't even have a tcrf page yet
2016-01-23 19:04:25	Yoshi2	I guess I will have to make one

2016-01-23 20:49:50	Yoshi2	Espyo: what's a version difference?
2016-01-23 20:50:01	@Espyo	I need to land like 10 charged shots on the Leviathan Infant at the end of Phaaze because I'm running PAL
2016-01-23 20:50:08	@Espyo	on NTSC, it's only 4 charged shots
2016-01-23 20:50:16	@Espyo	this would be FINE if the game gave enough health pickups to last that long

2016-01-23 20:50:28	@Espyo	it's impossible to reach the Leviathan Infant anyway
2016-01-23 20:50:35	@Espyo	since you need TAS to even destroy the fucking tunnel monster

2016-01-23 21:02:18	@Espyo	Prime 3 is easy

2016-01-23 21:03:25	@Espyo	but can't get to the final bosses because of the "use a jackhammer on the A button" enemy and the RNG not giving me enough health to survive
2016-01-23 21:05:29	En_Passant	Scruffy, you got cave changing working?
2016-01-23 21:08:47	Scruffy	I can change the type of enemies in it and the treasures in it
2016-01-23 21:09:16	Scruffy	Changing the number of enemies is iffy, because there's a "maximum enemy" parameter that doesn't always reflect the actual enemies there

2016-01-24 13:01:47	Testyo	if you accidentally press ´, which is near return

2016-01-24 13:08:47	Yoshi2	BW2 actually has a tcrf page
2016-01-24 13:09:02	Yoshi2	but it has about as much content as a blank piece of paper
2016-01-24 13:09:04	@Espyo	oh :|
2016-01-24 13:09:07	Yoshi2	maybe slightly more

2016-01-24 13:09:34	@Espyo	not very interesting, but still
2016-01-24 13:14:14	Yoshi2	it has some content, but that's content that you can see in plain text

2016-01-24 13:38:46	@Espyo	kirbyddd is an admin at the wikia

2016-01-24 14:17:21	Yoshi2	we currently have to implement shared memory for the microcontroller
2016-01-24 14:17:27	Yoshi2	and I'm here thinking
2016-01-24 14:18:02	Yoshi2	how do other processes even know the address of the shared memory?
2016-01-24 14:21:59	Yoshi2	maybe when I'm done with the assignment, I will know the answer

2016-01-24 21:15:03	Neocraftz1553	yes, tell me about it
2016-01-24 21:15:05	@Espyo	there are a LOT of instances of [[wikipedia:
2016-01-24 21:15:39	En_Passant	Too bad I can't help
2016-01-24 21:16:28	En_Passant	Not for another 3.5 hours or so
2016-01-24 21:16:42	@Espyo	focus on your thing
2016-01-24 21:16:46	@Espyo	I'll do this when I have time
2016-01-24 21:16:52	En_Passant	(My phone might die really soon)
2016-01-24 21:17:02	@Espyo	considering that compiling the engine under windows can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 6 minutes
2016-01-24 21:17:17	@Espyo	that gives me a lot of opportunities to sneak in another [[wikipedia -> {{w
2016-01-24 21:17:48	En_Passant	So there is find+replace?
2016-01-24 21:17:57	En_Passant	Or is it manual?
2016-01-24 21:18:16	@Espyo	manual
2016-01-24 21:18:28	@Espyo	there is a find, luckily
2016-01-24 21:18:36	@Espyo	I made a script to show a link to the edit page on each search result
2016-01-24 21:18:39	@Espyo	so that's one less step I need to take
2016-01-24 21:18:47	@Espyo	and from there, I just press F3
2016-01-24 21:18:58	@Espyo	because I already did ctrl+f for "[[wikipedia:"
2016-01-24 21:18:58	En_Passant	F3?
2016-01-24 21:19:08	@Espyo	it's the "find next" key on Firefox
2016-01-24 21:19:26	@Espyo	if I searched for "[[wikipedia:" before, pressing F3 will search again and go to the next result
2016-01-24 21:19:34	@Espyo	so I can just do F3 right away since it memorizes my previous search
2016-01-24 21:19:41	@Espyo	it also selects the text, so I just do the {{w|
2016-01-24 21:19:47	@Espyo	then I quickly check if I can shorten the template
2016-01-24 21:19:54	@Espyo	and replace the ]] at the end with a }}
2016-01-24 21:20:03	@Espyo	then do alt+shift+i for minor edit, and alt+shift+s to save
2016-01-24 21:20:04	@Espyo	and done
2016-01-24 21:20:09	@Espyo	so in short, I just:
2016-01-24 21:20:13	@Espyo	 1) click a result's edit button
2016-01-24 21:20:16	@Espyo	 2) press F3
2016-01-24 21:20:26	@Espyo	 3) press Ctrl+V (I have the {{w| on my clipboard)
2016-01-24 21:20:33	@Espyo	 4) shorten the template if needed
2016-01-24 21:20:37	@Espyo	 5) replace the ]] with }}
2016-01-24 21:20:42	@Espyo	 6) alt+shift+i and alt+shift+s
2016-01-24 21:20:43	@Espyo	done, next
2016-01-24 21:20:49	@Espyo	takes me like 20 seconds
2016-01-24 21:20:51	@Espyo	dinner now
2016-01-24 21:21:15	En_Passant	See you tomorrow , then
2016-01-24 21:21:27	En_Passant	Won't be back before you leave
2016-01-24 21:22:06	En_Passant	Actually, I might be on during my last break
2016-01-24 21:22:11	En_Passant	But not for long
2016-01-24 21:23:08	En_Passant	Assuming my phone holds out

2016-01-25 18:49:40	Scruffy	Hey Espyo!
2016-01-25 18:49:52	Scruffy	I hit the jackpot yesterday on Pikmin technical info
2016-01-25 18:50:22	Scruffy	firstly I finished my list of spawnable objects and their codes in above ground areas
2016-01-25 18:50:52	Scruffy	And apparently, the Waterwraith's rollers can be spawned safely, without the Waterwraith
2016-01-25 18:51:20	Yoshi2	hey Espyo, Testyo & Scruffy 
2016-01-25 18:51:21	Testyo	they have it, then Category:PCW appears along with Category:PCWEnemies
2016-01-25 18:51:34	Scruffy	Hey Yoshi2
2016-01-25 18:52:04	Scruffy	So Pikmin can touch the rollers fine, but if leaders touch them they get the "squashed" hurting animation even though the rollers aren't moving
2016-01-25 18:52:21	Scruffy	And since that animation doesn't knock you back, you just keep getting hurt until you die
2016-01-25 18:52:59	Scruffy	I also figured out I can not only change enemies, but easily add and subtract the
2016-01-25 18:53:01	Scruffy	them*
2016-01-25 18:53:30	Scruffy	The thing is, I figured out why some objects were not editable for me
2016-01-25 18:53:59	Scruffy	Any changes to object placements or parameters (in the field) have to be made before the first day they spawn
2016-01-25 18:54:13	Scruffy	It's kind of like a time paradox
2016-01-25 18:54:35	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-25 18:54:42	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-01-25 18:54:43	@Espyo	ooh, nice
2016-01-25 18:55:19	@Espyo	oh, I guess the save file keeps track of objects and their parameters, then
2016-01-25 18:55:20	@Espyo	for every area
2016-01-25 18:55:25	@Espyo	for every object
2016-01-25 18:55:27	@Espyo	...Nintendo is nuts
2016-01-25 18:55:30	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-25 18:55:57	Scruffy	If you change a parameter to make it so that Pikmin couldn't have defeated an object on the day they did, the object will just disappear
2016-01-25 18:56:14	Scruffy	like increasing the weight of a paper bag obstacle the day after it was deflated
2016-01-25 18:56:40	Scruffy	But just recently, I found something awesome
2016-01-25 18:56:51	Scruffy	All the coordinates of the Pikmin in the Pikmin 2 logo
2016-01-25 18:57:03	Scruffy	I found the file that tells them all where to go
2016-01-25 18:58:25	Scruffy	And I also found out that, when Pikmin are changing logos or being attacked by the Red Bulborb, they follow a behavioral framework called "Boids"
2016-01-25 18:58:41	Scruffy	Boid meaning "bird-oid"
2016-01-25 18:59:12	Scruffy	In which they avoid local crowdmates but try to steer around a general crowd center
2016-01-25 18:59:30	@Espyo	incredible
2016-01-25 18:59:40	@Espyo	you have to document your findings somewhere
2016-01-25 18:59:43	@Espyo	even if it's a text file
2016-01-25 18:59:55	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-25 19:00:26	Scruffy	Also apparently the flowers are a little larger in the Japanese version of the logo
2016-01-25 19:00:36	Scruffy	scale of 2.6 versus 2.4 for US
2016-01-25 19:01:24	Scruffy	Maybe I'll just put it in the forum
2016-01-25 19:01:33	Scruffy	Watercooler, that is
2016-01-25 19:03:42	@Espyo	sure
2016-01-25 19:03:54	@Espyo	when you do, point down what file they're on
2016-01-25 19:04:00	@Espyo	so I can add it to TCRF as a regional difference
2016-01-25 19:04:06	@Espyo	gah, Pikmin 2 has such little intricacies
2016-01-25 19:04:10	@Espyo	if we were to document everything
2016-01-25 19:04:20	@Espyo	the TCRF article for Pikmin 2 would be half the total size of TCRF
2016-01-25 19:04:23	@Espyo	I might've said that before
2016-01-25 19:04:28	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-25 19:05:57	@Espyo	meanwhile, bottomless pits are done
2016-01-25 19:06:13	@Espyo	still haven't quite figured out how to arrange my code so that enemies disappear, but at least Pikmin and leaders work fine
2016-01-25 19:06:24	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-01-25 19:06:28	@Espyo	Pikmin die (although it's a normal death, not like a weaaaaaaaaahhhh!!)
2016-01-25 19:06:35	@Espyo	and leaders respawn back where they initially spawned
2016-01-25 19:06:37	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-01-25 19:06:41	Scruffy	Ah, cool
2016-01-25 19:06:44	@Espyo	which is a lot better than spawning on nearby terrain
2016-01-25 19:06:50	@Espyo	or on a specific, kinda-random spot
2016-01-25 19:06:50	Scruffy	yes
2016-01-25 19:06:56	@Espyo	which raises all sorts of exploit possibilities
2016-01-25 19:06:59	@Espyo	LOOKING AT YOU, PIKMIN 2 AND 3
2016-01-25 19:07:27	Yoshi2	just now I decided to poke at the image format used in BW2, turns out it uses the same DXT1 that BW1 used
2016-01-25 19:07:44	@Espyo	are the engines any similar?
2016-01-25 19:07:47	Yoshi2	I also fixed the issue with grey looking spots in my decoder
2016-01-25 19:07:48	@Espyo	between BW1 and 2
2016-01-25 19:07:51	@Espyo	oh, nice

2016-01-25 19:31:03	Yoshi2	it's really annoying how the models definitely existed once: http://www.gavinrothery.com/battalion-wars/battalion-wars-kuju/10954435
2016-01-25 19:31:11	Yoshi2	and yet it is possible they don't exist in the game
2016-01-25 19:32:59	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-01-25 19:34:00	Yoshi2	hm
2016-01-25 19:34:03	Yoshi2	or maybe they do exist
2016-01-25 19:34:07	Yoshi2	just under a weird name

2016-01-25 19:35:39	Yoshi2	ok
2016-01-25 19:35:43	Yoshi2	I am definitely hyped right now
2016-01-25 19:35:48	Yoshi2	if the model actually exists

2016-01-25 19:49:58	Yoshi2	oops
2016-01-25 20:00:37	Yoshi2	ok, so there are 4 occurences of this texture in the game, 2 in singleplayer levels (5.2, 5.4), 1 in a multiplayer level (no. 15) and one in fe_units_x which I think is a bonus thingy which shows all the units
2016-01-25 20:01:18	Yoshi2	time to check those files
2016-01-25 20:05:17	@Espyo	oh, nice

2016-01-25 20:10:14	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-25 20:14:02	Yoshi2	well, this is just what is listed in the xml files, so the resource archives might contain more, but generally there is a correlation between what you can see in the xml file and what can be found in the resource files
2016-01-25 20:14:33	@Espyo	hmm, right
2016-01-25 20:31:42	@Espyo	I noticed Neo and BallsAngus uploaded videos of the engine
2016-01-25 20:31:56	@Espyo	with this, I can take a step back, and just look at how the engine is doing
2016-01-25 20:32:02	@Espyo	and I briefly imagined the final product
2016-01-25 20:32:05	@Espyo	and I am SO HYPED
2016-01-25 20:32:14	@Espyo	if I can get the engine the way I imagine it
2016-01-25 20:32:16	@Espyo	it'll be a work of art
2016-01-25 20:32:46	Yoshi2	nice
2016-01-25 20:33:53	Yoshi2	in BW2, there is MP15_Level.res and then it goes straight to MP17_Level.res
2016-01-25 20:34:11	Yoshi2	why must developers tease so much? :/
2016-01-25 20:34:36	@Espyo	hah
2016-01-25 20:35:06	Yoshi2	also leaving the APC textue in the game, but no model
2016-01-25 20:35:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-25 20:41:47	Yoshi2	the next step would be making a model renderer but eh
2016-01-25 20:41:55	Yoshi2	that is a whole new level of complexity

2016-01-25 20:47:54	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-25 20:50:30	PikFan	so, there was another NX leak recently
2016-01-25 20:50:50	@Espyo	hm?
2016-01-25 20:50:53	PikFan	it's saying that the handheld version will be released in 2016 and the home console will be released in 207
2016-01-25 20:50:56	PikFan	*2017
2016-01-25 20:51:21	PikFan	that actually makes sense, given that the 3DS is almost 5 years old now, and the Wii U will be 5 years old in 2017
2016-01-25 20:51:46	PikFan	the leak also claims that the handheld will be compatible with other devices, even the PS4
2016-01-25 20:51:48	PikFan	I think that
2016-01-25 20:51:58	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-25 20:52:03	PikFan	*I think that's taking it too far in terms of speculation
2016-01-25 20:52:06	PikFan	but who knows
2016-01-25 20:52:08	@Espyo	definitely
2016-01-25 20:52:11	PikFan	we'll find out this year
2016-01-25 20:52:45	PikFan	I also read an article that says that the console should still be named "NX" when it launched
2016-01-25 20:52:47	PikFan	*launches
2016-01-25 20:53:05	PikFan	and I have to say, "NX" does sound like a cool name

2016-01-25 22:03:31	@Espyo	plus the macros aren't very trustworthy
2016-01-25 22:03:48	@Espyo	remember back when you used to tell me what problems the engine had when compiling under Linux?
2016-01-25 22:04:02	@Espyo	you'd need some headers to be able to call min or max, but not under windows
2016-01-25 22:04:11	@Espyo	or windows just had those headers called by other headers *shrug*
2016-01-25 22:04:28	@Espyo	plus, if you try one of them with one argument being a float, and another being a double, it will complain
2016-01-25 22:04:36	@Espyo	and believe me, it'll try its best to act coy
2016-01-25 22:05:57	@J	also weird things if your arguments are expressions

2016-01-25 23:57:43	Scruffy	Yikes
2016-01-25 23:58:16	Neocraftz1553	and I edited with Movie maker and Videomux(I think thats what its called)
2016-01-25 23:58:29	Scruffy	ah
2016-01-25 23:59:35	Neocraftz1553	and to record it I used OBS
2016-01-26 00:00:42	Neocraftz1553	if you want to edit the videos recorded by it, you first have to use videomux to make the .vlc file into an mp4 file and then edit it with moviemaker

2016-01-26 00:13:07	Neocraftz1553	 2. I make another one based on the Forest Navel
2016-01-26 00:13:22	Neocraftz1553	Spotcaps will be used in either one
2016-01-26 00:13:30	Scruffy	I think do the Forest Navel first
2016-01-26 00:13:39	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 00:14:03	Neocraftz1553	I finally got Spotcaps to work yesterday
2016-01-26 00:15:09	Neocraftz1553	I was going to tell Espyo earlier, but he left
2016-01-26 00:16:30	Scruffy	Yeah, I don't know where he went
2016-01-26 00:17:03	Neocraftz1553	He goes to bed at 5:00 pm
2016-01-26 00:17:08	Neocraftz1553	well, on my clock anyways
2016-01-26 00:17:18	Neocraftz1553	it is real late over there at 5:00

2016-01-26 00:17:25	Scruffy	yeah
2016-01-26 00:17:49	Neocraftz1553	its probably 12:00 or something for him right now
2016-01-26 00:18:01	Scruffy	12:17
2016-01-26 00:18:11	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-26 00:18:57	Neocraftz1553	the only reason I know this is because we were talking about the engine and he suddenly said, gtg, it is almost 1:00
2016-01-26 00:20:30	Scruffy	Ah heh
2016-01-26 00:21:39	Neocraftz1553	yay, dazzreviews mentioned the forums

2016-01-26 00:23:05	Neocraftz1553	also, nice creative name for the P2 hack
2016-01-26 00:24:09	Scruffy	who, me?
2016-01-26 00:24:15	Neocraftz1553	yes

2016-01-26 00:25:24	Neocraftz1553	is there going to be bosses above ground?
2016-01-26 00:25:45	Neocraftz1553	I would love to see Raging Long Legs and Beady Long Legs above ground
2016-01-26 00:25:59	Scruffy	Probably
2016-01-26 00:26:14	Scruffy	you can already see the Burrowing Snagret and Beady long Legs above ground
2016-01-26 00:26:21	Neocraftz1553	wait, Beady is already in the Perplexing pool XD
2016-01-26 00:26:55	Neocraftz1553	Can you please add Raging long legs in the area where the burgeoning spiderworts are?
2016-01-26 00:27:18	Neocraftz1553	in uhhhh
2016-01-26 00:27:30	Neocraftz1553	whats it called
2016-01-26 00:27:37	Neocraftz1553	the Forest of repose?
2016-01-26 00:27:56	Neocraftz1553	wait thats not right.... Forest of...
2016-01-26 00:28:48	Neocraftz1553	Awakening Wood
2016-01-26 00:28:56	Neocraftz1553	yeah, that sounds right
2016-01-26 00:29:05	Scruffy	The Awakening Wood?
2016-01-26 00:29:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-26 00:29:11	Scruffy	Sure, but that's a little early on
2016-01-26 00:29:23	Neocraftz1553	isnt it supposed to be harder?
2016-01-26 00:29:33	Scruffy	True, order shouldn't matter
2016-01-26 00:29:41	Neocraftz1553	and Ill give you an idea on how to make it harder to reach the boss
2016-01-26 00:29:47	Scruffy	But also I don't know if it has enough space in that little room
2016-01-26 00:30:00	Neocraftz1553	can you remove water?
2016-01-26 00:30:32	Neocraftz1553	eh, doesnt matter
2016-01-26 00:30:45	Neocraftz1553	put it where you find the blue oniom
2016-01-26 00:30:50	Neocraftz1553	*onion
2016-01-26 00:31:05	Scruffy	But then where does the Blue Onion go?
2016-01-26 00:31:18	Neocraftz1553	in the little room of course
2016-01-26 00:31:43	Neocraftz1553	and replace the bramble gates with electric gates
2016-01-26 00:32:33	Neocraftz1553	would that work?
2016-01-26 00:33:13	Neocraftz1553	The water would look waaaaay cool with the long legs stomping around in there
2016-01-26 00:33:27	Scruffy	I agree, but I don't know if the Blue Onion can move
2016-01-26 00:33:44	Neocraftz1553	then squash it >>>: D
2016-01-26 00:33:47	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-01-26 00:34:00	Neocraftz1553	hmm.
2016-01-26 00:34:01	Neocraftz1553	..

2016-01-26 00:35:06	Neocraftz1553	wait, brb, gonna study P2 maps >.<
2016-01-26 00:35:51	Scruffy	Okay
2016-01-26 00:37:50	Neocraftz1553	hmm... can you change the order of which maps are discovered
2016-01-26 00:37:53	Neocraftz1553	nvm
2016-01-26 00:38:15	Neocraftz1553	you cant change the cutscenes, so itll always show you crashing into the Valley of Repose
2016-01-26 00:41:22	Scruffy	yeah, that's the beginning of the game
2016-01-26 00:41:33	Scruffy	You can't land anywhere else on Day 1 but the VoR
2016-01-26 00:44:03	Neocraftz1553	alright, remove the big flower enemies that eat your pikmin in the wistful wild and put the RLL there
2016-01-26 00:44:28	Neocraftz1553	is that possible?
2016-01-26 00:45:53	Neocraftz1553	and is it possible to make ot have more health? because the origional was extremely easy
2016-01-26 00:46:04	Neocraftz1553	*it have more health
2016-01-26 00:46:55	Scruffy	It's possible for it to have more health, but I don't know if it has enough space in that area
2016-01-26 00:46:57	Scruffy	It's huge
2016-01-26 00:47:26	Scruffy	The Awakening Wood has a lot of small pathways, they aren't really conducive to huge enemies
2016-01-26 00:47:47	Neocraftz1553	no, in the Wistful Wild
2016-01-26 00:48:32	Neocraftz1553	in the middle of the place where you find the plant enemies
2016-01-26 00:48:42	Scruffy	Ohhh
2016-01-26 00:48:47	Scruffy	Yeah, it could go there
2016-01-26 00:48:49	Neocraftz1553	A.K.A, the landing site in P1
2016-01-26 00:48:50	Scruffy	Certainly
2016-01-26 00:49:32	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 00:49:47	Neocraftz1553	how much HP does it have in P2?
2016-01-26 00:51:40	Neocraftz1553	•﹏•
2016-01-26 00:52:04	Scruffy	10000

2016-01-26 00:52:32	Neocraftz1553	and itbwas soooo easy to beat
2016-01-26 00:52:39	Neocraftz1553	can it go higher?
2016-01-26 00:52:47	Scruffy	You mean its feet?
2016-01-26 00:52:54	Scruffy	Or its life
2016-01-26 00:52:58	Neocraftz1553	no, derp, its health
2016-01-26 00:53:03	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-26 00:53:08	Scruffy	Strike that last comment
2016-01-26 00:53:14	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-26 00:53:14	Scruffy	The honeywisp has 99999 HP
2016-01-26 00:53:32	Neocraftz1553	cause it "dies" instantly
2016-01-26 00:53:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-26 00:53:43	Neocraftz1553	ok, make it have 
2016-01-26 00:53:44	Scruffy	I don't know why they had to set it so high though
2016-01-26 00:54:00	Neocraftz1553	can you make a boss retain its health?
2016-01-26 00:54:11	Scruffy	Over days? I cannot
2016-01-26 00:54:22	Neocraftz1553	)':
2016-01-26 00:54:23	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 00:54:32	Neocraftz1553	make it have 300000000000000
2016-01-26 00:54:34	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-01-26 00:54:37	Scruffy	Also if the RLL is easy to beat, I don't think giving it more health would make it harder
2016-01-26 00:54:50	Neocraftz1553	nah, just lengthier
2016-01-26 00:55:13	Neocraftz1553	 30000 health
2016-01-26 00:55:25	Neocraftz1553	wait no, 20000
2016-01-26 00:55:33	Scruffy	maybe just 15000
2016-01-26 00:55:36	Scruffy	or 16000
2016-01-26 00:55:42	Scruffy	And change something else about it
2016-01-26 00:55:43	Neocraftz1553	can you make its raging animation last longer, then?

2016-01-26 00:56:03	Scruffy	I can change a lot of things about it but they're in Japanese; it requires some experimentation
2016-01-26 00:56:09	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 00:56:12	Scruffy	I can translate them but not perfectly
2016-01-26 00:57:18	Neocraftz1553	if you can, make its raging attack last longer, 15000 hp, raging attack faster, and if you can, make each feet kill 25+ pikmin
2016-01-26 00:57:33	Scruffy	each foot can kill 100 Pikmin
2016-01-26 00:57:34	Neocraftz1553	and make its abdomen a bit higher
2016-01-26 00:57:46	Scruffy	I can't change its abdomen height
2016-01-26 00:57:50	Scruffy	Nothing about its shape
2016-01-26 00:57:55	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 00:58:28	Neocraftz1553	then make its raging faster 15000 hp and raging attack last more
2016-01-26 00:58:36	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-26 00:58:45	Neocraftz1553	that'll do
2016-01-26 00:58:55	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-26 00:59:17	Neocraftz1553	can you somehow make the beady long legs "rage" as well
2016-01-26 00:59:18	Scruffy	But first I need to start a little smaller

2016-01-26 01:00:56	Scruffy	I downloaded Dolphin and then searched Pikmin 2 iso

2016-01-26 01:33:22	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-01-26 01:33:23	ScruffyChat	It's like a big fatty Giant Breadbug
2016-01-26 01:33:34	Neocraftz1553	It is awsomeness
2016-01-26 01:33:40	ScruffyChat	thanks
2016-01-26 01:34:03	Neocraftz1553	A Lipid or something is a fat cell, I think
2016-01-26 01:34:14	ScruffyChat	Correct
2016-01-26 01:34:24	Neocraftz1553	yes, I knew it
2016-01-26 01:35:02	Neocraftz1553	the Lipidon looks awsome because it looks like it's hide is made out of fat
2016-01-26 01:35:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-26 01:35:18	ScruffyChat	That's the idea
2016-01-26 01:35:26	ScruffyChat	It functions like a Giant breadbug

2016-01-26 01:44:05	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 01:44:15	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-26 01:44:51	Neocraftz1553	for swarming functions, I think you shoood...
2016-01-26 01:45:52	Neocraftz1553	ok, do you have the cross-buttons used?
2016-01-26 01:46:22	ScruffyChat	Yes, for the dodge whistle, most likely
2016-01-26 01:46:32	ScruffyChat	And sprays
2016-01-26 01:46:43	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 01:46:54	Neocraftz1553	so left and right for dodgeing
2016-01-26 01:47:12	Neocraftz1553	how about up for sprays
2016-01-26 01:47:22	Neocraftz1553	press one to switch between sprays
2016-01-26 01:47:33	ScruffyChat	There's no 1 on a gamepad
2016-01-26 01:47:43	ScruffyChat	Oh, you're still thinking Wii Remote
2016-01-26 01:47:44	Neocraftz1553	use the touchscreen
2016-01-26 01:47:51	Neocraftz1553	tap the spray icon
2016-01-26 01:48:26	ScruffyChat	That could work
2016-01-26 01:49:01	Neocraftz1553	and the down button for the swarming, like in P1 and 2
2016-01-26 01:49:38	Neocraftz1553	but theres no arrows towards the cursor
2016-01-26 01:49:49	ScruffyChat	I feel like that might have a big reason been why they got rid of swarming in Pikmin 3
2016-01-26 01:49:57	ScruffyChat	Too many controls
2016-01-26 01:50:00	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-26 01:50:06	ScruffyChat	Or too much power with the controls
2016-01-26 01:50:19	Neocraftz1553	but swarming is pretty useful
2016-01-26 01:50:30	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-01-26 01:51:31	Neocraftz1553	I am watching dazz play P3
2016-01-26 01:51:50	Neocraftz1553	and I think Purple Pikmin should have a deeper voice
2016-01-26 01:52:24	En_Passant	I agree
2016-01-26 01:52:25	Neocraftz1553	and White Pikmin a more higher pitched voice than yellows
2016-01-26 01:53:04	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant
2016-01-26 01:53:13	En_Passant	hi
2016-01-26 01:53:19	Neocraftz1553	Hello, en_passant
2016-01-26 01:53:23	En_Passant	fell asleep
2016-01-26 01:53:30	ScruffyChat	Heh, no problem
2016-01-26 01:53:52	ScruffyChat	And suddenly, you woke up at the Onion
2016-01-26 01:53:59	Neocraftz1553	I also wouldnt mind Purples having different amounts of "hair" on them
2016-01-26 01:54:02	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-26 01:54:16	ScruffyChat	I wish they had kept different shaped Rock Pikmin
2016-01-26 01:54:23	ScruffyChat	That made them seem a little more realistic
2016-01-26 01:54:26	Neocraftz1553	they removed them??
2016-01-26 01:54:31	Neocraftz1553	yeah it did
2016-01-26 01:55:01	ScruffyChat	Although they probably wanted to make each Rock Pikmin seem equally balanced with the rest
2016-01-26 01:55:20	Neocraftz1553	it made them all feel unique, though
2016-01-26 01:55:42	Neocraftz1553	hopefully the put it back in P4
2016-01-26 01:56:07	Neocraftz1553	Although, as dazz had said, they would probably be pushed aside to challenge mode
2016-01-26 01:56:16	Neocraftz1553	along with Purples, Whites, and Winged
2016-01-26 01:57:43	Neocraftz1553	actually, Whites and Purples might not even appear in the fourth game D:
2016-01-26 02:05:41	ScruffyChat	2 dialogues left
2016-01-26 02:05:48	En_Passant	which ones?
2016-01-26 02:06:00	ScruffyChat	The Waterwraith one and the 100 Pikmin (with 5 wild Pikmin) one
2016-01-26 02:06:09	ScruffyChat	I'm working on the Waterwraith now
2016-01-26 02:11:49	ScruffyChat	Okay, that's done
2016-01-26 02:12:03	ScruffyChat	Just one more and the Ship's help will be entirely useless

2016-01-26 02:26:15	ScruffyChat	So I'll start with some menu text and then either get into mail or Piklopedia articles
2016-01-26 02:29:25	ScruffyChat	Thank you for the new treasure names, by the way!
2016-01-26 02:29:28	ScruffyChat	They're great
2016-01-26 02:32:33	En_Passant	thanks

2016-01-26 03:04:13	Neocraftz1553	do you still take music requests, scruffy?
2016-01-26 03:04:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah, but I've get behind because of my schedule
2016-01-26 03:04:46	ScruffyChat	But I'll definitely take a request
2016-01-26 03:04:50	ScruffyChat	It just might take a while
2016-01-26 03:05:51	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-26 03:06:30	Neocraftz1553	can you make a Forest Navel remix? kinda like the Impact site remix you made
2016-01-26 03:07:09	Neocraftz1553	try to make it a bit darker
2016-01-26 03:07:19	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah!
2016-01-26 03:07:47	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 03:07:53	ScruffyChat	I already have made arrangements of most of the Pikmin music already
2016-01-26 03:08:00	ScruffyChat	It just needs some tweaking
2016-01-26 03:08:26	Neocraftz1553	so, you wouldn't mind making a Forest of Hope and Distant Spring remix either?
2016-01-26 03:08:59	ScruffyChat	Not at all
2016-01-26 03:09:18	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 03:09:24	Neocraftz1553	just some things to add to:
2016-01-26 03:09:25	ScruffyChat	It just might take a while with the way my schedule is now
2016-01-26 03:09:40	ScruffyChat	I didn't expect my schedule to be so busy
2016-01-26 03:09:56	Neocraftz1553	its ok, dont need em right away
2016-01-26 03:10:25	Neocraftz1553	Just make the Distant Spring a more atmospheric
2016-01-26 03:10:30	Neocraftz1553	like...
2016-01-26 03:10:52	Neocraftz1553	make it have a feeling of vastness
2016-01-26 03:11:07	Neocraftz1553	it already has that feeling, but try to bring ut out more
2016-01-26 03:11:19	Neocraftz1553	and the Forest of hope
2016-01-26 03:12:06	Neocraftz1553	Make it a bit more calm
2016-01-26 03:12:59	Neocraftz1553	that is all I ask (σ   )σ
2016-01-26 03:13:19	Neocraftz1553	for
2016-01-26 03:13:20	ScruffyChat	Cool!
2016-01-26 03:15:21	Neocraftz1553	thank you for the enthusiasm
2016-01-26 03:15:32	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-01-26 03:15:52	ScruffyChat	That project is very near done, I just need to tweak it a little
2016-01-26 03:16:03	ScruffyChat	But it still might be postponed a little throughout this week
2016-01-26 03:16:13	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-26 03:26:54	Neocraftz1553	Making Shearwig 🎶
2016-01-26 03:35:29	En_Passant	It seems like there are more important things to be doing than the Piklopedia entries
2016-01-26 03:36:07	En_Passant	It'd be nice to have them, but you should probably focus on the difficulty aspect of the mod, because that's the main reason you did it
2016-01-26 03:37:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-26 03:37:48	ScruffyChat	At least the Ship is done though
2016-01-26 03:38:05	ScruffyChat	it adds to the difficulty that the Ship does not help, or even detracts sometimes
2016-01-26 03:39:00	En_Passant	Only if you're not experienced with the game
2016-01-26 03:39:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-26 03:39:20	ScruffyChat	I'm not fooling anyone, it's just for laughs
2016-01-26 03:39:42	En_Passant	yeah lol
2016-01-26 03:41:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I'm going to start on the area modding

2016-01-26 03:42:06	ScruffyChat	I've figured out that in overworlds I can not only change enemies but add and subtract them
2016-01-26 03:46:53	ScruffyChat	I just need to get my bearings with positioning them
2016-01-26 03:48:01	En_Passant	Sounds good
2016-01-26 03:48:28	ScruffyChat	And now I have a spreadsheet; just enter a number and I have whatever enemy we want
2016-01-26 03:49:47	En_Passant	Is that by Piklopedia number or the order in the game's code?
2016-01-26 03:50:32	ScruffyChat	The haphazard order in the game's code
2016-01-26 03:50:40	ScruffyChat	But I've also arranged it alphabetically
2016-01-26 03:55:45	En_Passant	I wonder what sort of changes you have
2016-01-26 03:56:15	En_Passant	Though I also don't want everything spoiled
2016-01-26 03:56:39	En_Passant	Ruins the surprise of the difficulty
2016-01-26 03:56:47	ScruffyChat	True
2016-01-26 03:56:57	ScruffyChat	I did want to ask you something about an idea I had though
2016-01-26 03:57:10	ScruffyChat	I can change the amount of time it takes for enemies to respawn
2016-01-26 03:57:33	ScruffyChat	So I was wondering if I should have some enemies that you actually /need/ to help you
2016-01-26 03:57:56	ScruffyChat	For example, a Careening Dirigibug in a lake that can help you take out underwater poison
2016-01-26 03:58:40	En_Passant	Yes
2016-01-26 03:58:44	En_Passant	yesyesyes
2016-01-26 03:58:50	ScruffyChat	yay!
2016-01-26 03:59:16	En_Passant	How long of a respawn are you thinking?
2016-01-26 03:59:23	ScruffyChat	Like every day
2016-01-26 03:59:27	En_Passant	Oh
2016-01-26 03:59:37	ScruffyChat	So that if it didn't work, you wouldn't have to wait too long
2016-01-26 03:59:43	ScruffyChat	Do you think it should be longer?
2016-01-26 03:59:53	En_Passant	No
2016-01-26 04:00:15	En_Passant	If you /need/ the enemy, it should be easily accessible
2016-01-26 04:00:22	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-26 04:00:36	En_Passant	Every day means that if you screw up and kill it, you can hit Go to Sunset and be able to try again
2016-01-26 04:00:43	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-26 04:00:47	ScruffyChat	Or, Go to Sun-up
2016-01-26 04:00:52	En_Passant	... yeah
2016-01-26 04:01:01	En_Passant	Sunrise
2016-01-26 04:01:10	En_Passant	But that's too long, isn't it
2016-01-26 04:01:18	ScruffyChat	unfortunately
2016-01-26 04:01:25	ScruffyChat	unless I change "Go to"
2016-01-26 04:01:51	ScruffyChat	SOmething like "Sunrise Now"
2016-01-26 04:02:43	En_Passant	Skip to Dawn
2016-01-26 04:02:47	ScruffyChat	Nice
2016-01-26 04:02:49	ScruffyChat	Perfect
2016-01-26 04:04:46	En_Passant	How do enemies that drop treasures work?
2016-01-26 04:05:00	ScruffyChat	I think they're actually listed as part of the treasures
2016-01-26 04:05:09	ScruffyChat	And they have "treasure item codes"
2016-01-26 04:05:18	En_Passant	Kinda like the buried property?
2016-01-26 04:05:25	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-26 04:05:38	ScruffyChat	But, simply to spite me, the numbers are not the treasures' ID numbers
2016-01-26 04:05:47	ScruffyChat	They're crazy high ones like 795, 801

2016-01-26 04:07:57	En_Passant	It hates the world
2016-01-26 04:08:52	ScruffyChat	And how
2016-01-26 04:09:03	ScruffyChat	So I don't know if I should mess with those
2016-01-26 04:09:16	ScruffyChat	but I can at least change the /type/ of enemy that holds the treasure
2016-01-26 04:09:24	ScruffyChat	And certainly where they are
2016-01-26 04:11:15	En_Passant	Can you change the map of a treasure?
2016-01-26 04:11:26	ScruffyChat	What do you mean?
2016-01-26 04:11:54	En_Passant	Can you move a treasure from a cave to another cave, or to an overworld?
2016-01-26 04:12:01	ScruffyChat	I think so
2016-01-26 04:12:17	ScruffyChat	I think the game can actually handle treasure duplicates or missing treasures just fine
2016-01-26 04:12:30	ScruffyChat	You just get more money and/or never finish the game
2016-01-26 04:15:10	En_Passant	I have a couple of ideas on the locations of treasures
2016-01-26 04:15:19	ScruffyChat	Absolutely
2016-01-26 04:15:22	ScruffyChat	Fire away
2016-01-26 04:15:44	En_Passant	First, will you have the radar?
2016-01-26 04:16:07	ScruffyChat	Hmmm
2016-01-26 04:16:13	ScruffyChat	Actually I think not
2016-01-26 04:16:18	ScruffyChat	If I can help it
2016-01-26 04:16:34	En_Passant	That'll make White Pikmin treasures a pain in the ass to find
2016-01-26 04:16:38	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure where the radar is programmed, but at the very least I can erase the textures
2016-01-26 04:16:41	ScruffyChat	True
2016-01-26 04:16:51	En_Passant	I wouldn't remove it entirely
2016-01-26 04:16:53	ScruffyChat	Like, I can get rid of visuals and keep the sound
2016-01-26 04:17:02	En_Passant	Move it to Wistful Wild, maybe
2016-01-26 04:17:15	ScruffyChat	Hahaha
2016-01-26 04:17:23	ScruffyChat	Sure
2016-01-26 04:17:34	En_Passant	Bottom of the Hole of Heroes
2016-01-26 04:17:47	ScruffyChat	Put all the upgrades in the Wistful Wild after you had any use for them
2016-01-26 04:17:49	En_Passant	You have to earn your damn treasure finder, peasant
2016-01-26 04:18:04	En_Passant	All of them?
2016-01-26 04:18:08	En_Passant	That might be a stretch
2016-01-26 04:18:11	ScruffyChat	Maybe not all
2016-01-26 04:18:15	ScruffyChat	Rush boots are good
2016-01-26 04:18:45	En_Passant	The immunity treasures might be usable to block of some treasures
2016-01-26 04:18:59	ScruffyChat	Hm, how so?
2016-01-26 04:19:20	ScruffyChat	Oh also, fire geysers are now going to be ever active

2016-01-26 04:19:39	ScruffyChat	Should they be?
2016-01-26 04:19:52	En_Passant	If were possible to have both kinds, I'd say yes
2016-01-26 04:20:06	ScruffyChat	I don't think I can make two kinds
2016-01-26 04:20:12	En_Passant	darn
2016-01-26 04:20:48	ScruffyChat	So which is better then?
2016-01-26 04:21:01	ScruffyChat	I think maybe defeatable
2016-01-26 04:21:09	ScruffyChat	Well...
2016-01-26 04:21:11	ScruffyChat	I can't decide
2016-01-26 04:23:17	En_Passant	Alright, pros vs. cons time
2016-01-26 04:23:37	En_Passant	Pro of being undefeatable: Create areas where only reds and leaders with Scorch Guard can pass
2016-01-26 04:24:37	En_Passant	Con: Water already does this with blues, though it can't be used to force you to have a certain upgrade
2016-01-26 04:25:48	En_Passant	Pro of being defeatable: Reds serve a purpose to the larger army, as opposed to cheap "chosen one" gates
2016-01-26 04:26:04	En_Passant	Con: Not much harder than standard.
2016-01-26 04:26:17	ScruffyChat	yeah
2016-01-26 04:26:43	ScruffyChat	I'm actually not sure how I'd make them undefeatable
2016-01-26 04:26:48	En_Passant	Leaning towards undefeatable, because of the ability to force you to have Scorch Guard to proceed
2016-01-26 04:26:56	En_Passant	Unless you can d-boost through it
2016-01-26 04:26:57	ScruffyChat	I have to test whether 0 life is undefeatable or defeated
2016-01-26 04:27:09	ScruffyChat	I'm liking undefeatable too
2016-01-26 04:29:51	En_Passant	You can potentially make them pseudo-invincible if it doesn't work
2016-01-26 04:30:06	En_Passant	Give them high health and suuuuper high regeneration and reviving
2016-01-26 04:31:06	ScruffyChat	Absolutely
2016-01-26 04:31:19	ScruffyChat	ooooh that'd be interesting to use on an enemy as well
2016-01-26 04:31:29	ScruffyChat	To give you an unbeatable foe that can only be avoided
2016-01-26 04:33:30	En_Passant	Volatile Dweevils can't be made to revive since they don't leave a corpse, can they?
2016-01-26 04:33:47	ScruffyChat	Nope
2016-01-26 04:33:53	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately
2016-01-26 04:34:25	ScruffyChat	I'm pretty sure the only creatures who can revive are the ones who already do

2016-01-26 04:41:01	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-26 04:41:19	ScruffyChat	I was defenseless, but fortunately it couldn't cross the deflated paper pags
2016-01-26 04:41:22	ScruffyChat	bags*
2016-01-26 04:41:31	En_Passant	That's interesting
2016-01-26 04:41:41	En_Passant	Can you spawn paper bags?
2016-01-26 04:41:54	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-26 04:42:02	En_Passant	You could use that to make a "danger zone" where a Waterwraith patrols
2016-01-26 04:42:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I suppose I could
2016-01-26 04:42:20	En_Passant	Unfortunately, getting Purples means you can just kill it
2016-01-26 04:42:44	En_Passant	But you also have the power to change where you get Purples and Whites
2016-01-26 04:43:08	ScruffyChat	Yes, I do!
2016-01-26 04:43:36	ScruffyChat	And I can also put Bulbmin above ground, which is a big dynamic to think about in itself
2016-01-26 04:43:49	En_Passant	Hm...
2016-01-26 04:44:01	En_Passant	Can they leave the area or go into caves?
2016-01-26 04:44:20	ScruffyChat	I have yet to try
2016-01-26 04:44:34	ScruffyChat	I think someone tried that and put it in the [[Bulbmin]] article though
2016-01-26 04:45:19	ScruffyChat	oh, never mind
2016-01-26 04:45:54	En_Passant	no, they did
2016-01-26 04:45:59	En_Passant	In the Trivia section
2016-01-26 04:46:09	En_Passant	"If the game is altered such that it allows Bulbmin on the surface, they will take refuge in the ship's storage when the day ends, just like Purple Pikmin and White Pikmin. They will still count towards Olimar's Pikmin count, but they cannot be taken out of the ship the next morning."
2016-01-26 04:46:20	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-26 04:46:22	En_Passant	It's not sourced
2016-01-26 04:46:29	En_Passant	Still sounds inadvisable, though
2016-01-26 04:46:49	ScruffyChat	I agree
2016-01-26 04:47:02	ScruffyChat	I'll still include some Candypop puzzles, at least
2016-01-26 04:47:52	En_Passant	hm

2016-01-26 04:49:27	En_Passant	Can you alter the boulders Cannon Beetles spit out?
2016-01-26 04:49:51	ScruffyChat	Yes, but I can't spawn them by themselves. It crashes the game
2016-01-26 04:50:12	En_Passant	Okay
2016-01-26 04:50:24	Neocraftz1553	what about the boulders in caves
2016-01-26 04:50:45	ScruffyChat	I can spawn all the falling boulders I want
2016-01-26 04:52:43	En_Passant	Can you change their damage against enemies?
2016-01-26 04:53:33	En_Passant	(which also applies to leaders, i guess)
2016-01-26 04:54:25	En_Passant	Oh, it's here on the article
2016-01-26 04:54:38	ScruffyChat	I think so
2016-01-26 04:54:47	ScruffyChat	But it does 10 damage, so I know that's only to leaders
2016-01-26 04:56:50	ScruffyChat	Okay, 0 life is defeated
2016-01-26 04:57:03	ScruffyChat	So it's going to have to be super high life super high recovery

2016-01-26 05:31:18	ScruffyChat	So I just gave them 9,999,999,999 health
2016-01-26 05:32:46	En_Passant	That doesn't overflow?
2016-01-26 05:32:49	ScruffyChat	And I think that made it invincible
2016-01-26 05:33:05	En_Passant	See how long it takes reds to destroy it

2016-01-26 05:34:25	En_Passant	Really, I'm just interested in how long it takes
2016-01-26 05:34:29	ScruffyChat	If a health wheel doesn't appear in a thirteen minute day
2016-01-26 05:34:37	ScruffyChat	I'm going to be very impressed
2016-01-26 05:35:50	ScruffyChat	I had tried it at 999,000,000 and a health wheel had definitely appeared by noon
2016-01-26 05:35:54	ScruffyChat	or, midnight
2016-01-26 05:40:31	En_Passant	With 20?
2016-01-26 05:40:37	ScruffyChat	The whole 13 minutes spent without a scratch
2016-01-26 05:40:48	ScruffyChat	with 20, yes
2016-01-26 05:41:40	ScruffyChat	I feel it's safe to call it invincible for now
2016-01-26 05:42:04	ScruffyChat	Unless I get 30 spicy sprays and 100 flower Pikmin and have an hour or so to test it

2016-01-26 18:46:44	Testyo	again it's valid in both US and GB English
2016-01-26 18:47:36	Scruffy	I set a fire geyser to the highest HP it could have without adding integers
2016-01-26 18:47:43	Scruffy	That is, 9,999,999,999
2016-01-26 18:48:06	Scruffy	And after an hour of a full army of Red Pikmin and 41 spicy sprays, the health wheel didn't even show up
2016-01-26 18:48:20	Scruffy	I think it's safe to say the game considers it invincible
2016-01-26 18:48:30	Scruffy	So I've created the P1 fire geyser in P2
2016-01-26 18:48:58	Scruffy	Sort of... Pikmin can still attack it though, if futilely

2016-01-26 18:51:30	@Espyo	it might consider the fire geyser invincible, but accidentally
2016-01-26 18:51:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-26 18:51:45	@Espyo	like, the calculations it does aren't enough for it to consider real damage in a single frame
2016-01-26 18:51:49	@Espyo	so it never does consider damage
2016-01-26 18:51:51	@Espyo	so no damage ever
2016-01-26 18:51:56	@Espyo	although it WANTS the geyser to take damage, it just can't
2016-01-26 18:51:58	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-26 18:52:13	@Espyo	it'd be fun if you could disable attacking the geysers

2016-01-26 18:52:40	Scruffy	Maybe turning the collisions off
2016-01-26 18:52:58	Scruffy	No, that would turn off the fire's damage

2016-01-26 19:06:44	@J	email subject: 'Hello, I think you're cool and want you to have some free games'
2016-01-26 19:06:44	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-26 19:06:49	@Espyo	pfft
2016-01-26 19:06:54	@Espyo	I don't even
2016-01-26 19:07:01	@J	and the page says 'If you already own these games, please feel free to pass the codes on to a friend you think will enjoy them :)'
2016-01-26 19:07:08	@Espyo	well, that makes sense at least
2016-01-26 19:07:11	@Espyo	and you did do that
2016-01-26 19:07:16	@Espyo	or at least tried to, since we never said yes
2016-01-26 19:07:17	@J	yep and yep
2016-01-26 19:07:20	@Espyo	no thanks, btw
2016-01-26 19:07:27	@Espyo	hey, speaking of free stuff, I have a game on Steam that I never bought or was gifted
2016-01-26 19:07:36	@Espyo	Race The Sun...
2016-01-26 19:07:39	@Espyo	it was just there one day
2016-01-26 19:07:43	@Espyo	still there today
2016-01-26 19:07:47	@J	well, pass it on if you think someone will like it
2016-01-26 19:07:49	@Espyo	says I bought it back on July, but I never did
2016-01-26 19:07:52	@J	that was in a bundle, I think
2016-01-26 19:08:01	@Espyo	this isn't a key though, so there's nothing I can do
2016-01-26 19:08:02	@J	maybe you bought a bundle, activated it on Steam, then they added games to it
2016-01-26 19:08:10	@Espyo	nope, never bought a single bundle
2016-01-26 19:08:13	@J	I think they do whole-bundle keys sometimes now
2016-01-26 19:08:15	@J	hmm
2016-01-26 19:08:21	@J	oh right, the weird Portugal money thing
2016-01-26 19:08:25	@Espyo	it honestly just came out of nowhere
2016-01-26 19:08:35	@Espyo	well, my parents have a credit card now, and I use it every once in a while
2016-01-26 19:08:38	@J	well, Steam likes you
2016-01-26 19:08:41	@Espyo	I couldn't get one for myself because really REALLY weird stuff
2016-01-26 19:08:48	@J	maybe some random event?  Was it on your wishlist?
2016-01-26 19:08:53	@Espyo	you need to be 26, but they can open exceptions, but only if they like your bank account
2016-01-26 19:08:59	@Espyo	it wasn't on my wishlist either
2016-01-26 19:09:04	@Espyo	I never received an e-mail
2016-01-26 19:09:05	@J	had you even heard of it?
2016-01-26 19:09:08	@Espyo	nothing... just nothing
2016-01-26 19:09:10	@Espyo	not even heard of it
2016-01-26 19:09:15	@J	well, Race the Sun is quite fun, I like it
2016-01-26 19:09:18	@Espyo	granted, it's a pretty generic name
2016-01-26 19:09:25	Yoshi2	Espyo: race the sun could be acquired for free at one point
2016-01-26 19:09:26	@Espyo	so maybe I heard it, but never memorized it
2016-01-26 19:09:28	Yoshi2	I have it too
2016-01-26 19:09:38	@Espyo	...that... rings a bell
2016-01-26 19:09:49	@J	hah, just clicking random 'free stuff' here buttons
2016-01-26 19:09:50	@J	way to go
2016-01-26 19:09:50	@Espyo	I think that at one point, I talked to somebody about getting something, because it was free to purchase
2016-01-26 19:09:58	@Espyo	i-it can't be
2016-01-26 19:10:01	@Espyo	I'm not the kind to do that
2016-01-26 19:10:05	@J	*'free stuff here' buttons
2016-01-26 19:10:05	@Espyo	specially knowing I'd never really play it
2016-01-26 19:10:18	Yoshi2	click here to get a free ipod 5s
2016-01-26 19:11:29	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-01-26 19:12:54	Scruffy	Darn it, the devs were one step ahead of me
2016-01-26 19:13:09	Scruffy	There's an invisible wall on top of paper bags in case leaders get up there
2016-01-26 19:13:18	@Espyo	yeah, hehe
2016-01-26 19:13:26	@Espyo	actually, I think it's more simple than that
2016-01-26 19:13:34	@Espyo	it's so you can't throw Pikmin beyond them and be unable to whistle them back
2016-01-26 19:13:50	Scruffy	Ah
2016-01-26 19:14:21	@Espyo	I noticed that a couple of weeks back
2016-01-26 19:14:24	@Espyo	not sure if I added it to the wiki
2016-01-26 19:14:27	@Espyo	or if it's still on my todo

2016-01-26 19:14:50	Scruffy	I added a pair of weights to the Valley of Repose in order to get up there
2016-01-26 19:15:10	@Espyo	nope, never added
2016-01-26 19:15:14	Scruffy	I guess if I add another pair I can get up to the walls beside the paper bag, and get across
2016-01-26 19:15:18	@Espyo	heh, neat
2016-01-26 19:15:56	Scruffy	Or maybe not
2016-01-26 19:15:56	Scruffy	The invisible wall stretches beyond the bag
2016-01-26 19:16:54	Scruffy	Well, there's always the other way around
2016-01-26 19:16:59	Scruffy	Oh, gotta go

2016-01-26 20:35:45	@Espyo	some Pikmin just delivered something to the Red Onion
2016-01-26 20:35:55	@Espyo	as it was sucking up, the pellet was going towards the Blue Onion

2016-01-26 20:49:46	@Espyo	it's mental
2016-01-26 20:50:42	@Espyo	they want you to optimize the PNGs you upload

2016-01-26 21:28:43	@Espyo	there was this picture of a flea with a STOP sign behind it
2016-01-26 21:28:52	@Espyo	two of the options were flea and mite

2016-01-26 21:29:17	@Espyo	since they're both tiny critters that you don't really see daily
2016-01-26 21:29:35	@Espyo	you could at least infer flea from the STOP sign
2016-01-26 21:29:42	@Espyo	the other options were spider and scorpion

2016-01-26 23:17:56	@Espyo	install it elsewhere
2016-01-26 23:18:04	@Espyo	if it doesn't work out, you can always go back to the version you have now right away
2016-01-26 23:18:28	Neocraftz1553	yeah, ok

2016-01-26 23:54:47	Scruffy	Just discovered how to change water locations
2016-01-26 23:56:27	@Espyo	the waterboxes?
2016-01-26 23:56:32	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-26 23:56:38	@Espyo	yeah, luckily those aren't very tough
2016-01-26 23:56:47	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-01-26 23:56:51	@Espyo	I have to remove them to make overview maps of the areas
2016-01-26 23:56:57	@Espyo	water shows up really broken with free camera
2016-01-26 23:57:03	Scruffy	Yeah, I've been there
2016-01-26 23:57:04	@Espyo	so I had to learn how to take water out
2016-01-26 23:57:10	@Espyo	and I was like "...oh, that's all I need to do"
2016-01-26 23:57:30	@Espyo	hey, you can probably change the water on some places to spice things up a bit
2016-01-26 23:57:39	Scruffy	Already have onece

2016-01-27 02:40:56	En_Passant	Scruffy
2016-01-27 02:42:46	Scruffy	Hi
2016-01-27 02:43:20	En_Passant	What's new?
2016-01-27 02:43:40	Scruffy	I've been adding things to the Valley of Repose second day
2016-01-27 02:44:17	Scruffy	I've thought of a completely new puzzle to get the Spherical Atlas
2016-01-27 02:44:17	En_Passant	What about Day 1?
2016-01-27 02:44:27	Scruffy	Nothing's changed on day 1 yet
2016-01-27 02:44:46	Scruffy	Except I made the Courage Reactor 1 Pikmin weight so I could speed up testing it :P
2016-01-27 02:44:59	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-27 02:45:08	Scruffy	But for now I've been adding and tweaking seesaw blocks
2016-01-27 02:45:16	Scruffy	And changing water levels
2016-01-27 02:46:00	En_Passant	Do you go up the ledge at the manhole cover instead of to Emergence Cave?
2016-01-27 02:47:05	Scruffy	The Emergence Cave will be in a different spot
2016-01-27 02:47:09	Scruffy	But you do go up that ledge
2016-01-27 02:47:32	Scruffy	See, in this version, the paper bag is too heavy for 100 Pikmin, you need Purple Pikmin
2016-01-27 02:47:48	Scruffy	So there's an alternate, harder route to get around the paper bag
2016-01-27 02:48:06	Scruffy	Using that high ledge (where the Burrowing Snagret would be later) and some seesaw blocks
2016-01-27 02:48:22	En_Passant	You still get Purples in Emergence?

2016-01-27 02:50:20	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-27 02:50:25	Scruffy	On the 1st sublevel
2016-01-27 02:50:45	Scruffy	And I don't know if this message sent, but I had said on the 2nd I'd put a Waterwraith

2016-01-27 02:55:37	Neocraftz1553	but the Waterwraith sounds cool
2016-01-27 02:55:48	En_Passant	What does it drop?
2016-01-27 02:55:55	Scruffy	Utter Scrap

2016-01-27 02:56:27	Scruffy	See, the Spherical Atlas would be where the Utter Scrap would be
2016-01-27 02:56:35	En_Passant	Oh
2016-01-27 02:56:41	Scruffy	And there's a Giant Breadbug in the center of the sewer lid
2016-01-27 02:56:47	En_Passant	Lol
2016-01-27 02:56:47	Scruffy	So he'd steal it before you could get it
2016-01-27 02:56:55	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-27 02:57:08	Scruffy	So defeat the Breadbug/deflate the bag, you need purples
2016-01-27 02:57:08	En_Passant	Pulling out all the stops
2016-01-27 02:57:15	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-27 02:57:23	Neocraftz1553	so it'll "spawn" with the treasure
2016-01-27 02:58:15	En_Passant	Don't you need double weight to pull a Giant?
2016-01-27 02:58:29	Scruffy	I think
2016-01-27 02:58:35	Scruffy	But you can also hurt him with Purples
2016-01-27 02:58:37	En_Passant	Or are they literally the same to kill as regular Breadbugs?
2016-01-27 02:59:06	Scruffy	They are only hurt by Purples

2016-01-27 03:06:38	Scruffy	Yesss
2016-01-27 03:06:56	Scruffy	Now I have it so that there's a set of seesaw blocks that can get you on the ledge next to the Red Onion
2016-01-27 03:07:07	Scruffy	And from there you can take the high path to the sewer lid
2016-01-27 03:07:24	Scruffy	One seesaw block is right next to the Red Onion, of course...
