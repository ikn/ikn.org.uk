2016-02-23 19:38:04	@Espyo	hence the "that is me"
2016-02-23 19:38:10	@Espyo	not so much a "that is where I should go"
2016-02-23 19:38:20	@Espyo	it's just that you were warned twice already
2016-02-23 19:38:21	@J	hey, it's all one thing
2016-02-23 19:38:23	@Espyo	so... better safe than sorry
2016-02-23 19:38:49	@J	and anyway, the channels are separated, it's just each one displays join/part messages every time someone goes online
2016-02-23 19:38:55	@J	completely fills the screen
2016-02-23 19:38:57	@Espyo	oh
2016-02-23 19:39:59	@J	ooh, I did an amazing filter thing
2016-02-23 19:40:13	@J	weechat lets you set message filters for servers/channels individually
2016-02-23 19:40:35	@J	and it applies instantly and retroactively, so now I see all the recent messages clearly
2016-02-23 19:40:47	@Espyo	oh good
2016-02-23 19:40:51	@Espyo	yeah, I was going to suggest
2016-02-23 19:43:45	@J	also it shows me as J in that channel, and I'm an op...
2016-02-23 19:44:28	@J	I kind of wonder what kick does
2016-02-23 19:44:58	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-23 19:45:30	@J	amazingly ping worked on you
2016-02-23 19:45:43	@J	but not ctcp
2016-02-23 19:45:55	@J	did it send you a weird message?
2016-02-23 19:47:43	@Espyo	nopr

2016-02-23 19:47:56	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-02-23 19:48:23	Scruffy	I've discovered something really weird about the title screen
2016-02-23 19:48:35	Scruffy	Of Pikmin 2
2016-02-23 19:48:59	Scruffy	Well, not just one thing, but this thing I know no one has noticed before
2016-02-23 19:49:28	@Espyo	oh?
2016-02-23 19:49:34	Scruffy	every time you change the logo from "Pikmin 2" to "Nintendo," all the surrounding plants and foliage do a little waving animation
2016-02-23 19:49:46	Scruffy	It's /so/ subtle, because it's set to take 8 seconds
2016-02-23 19:49:46	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-02-23 19:50:04	Scruffy	But setting it to 1 shows you, they do it every time
2016-02-23 19:50:11	Scruffy	And only when the logo changes like that

2016-02-23 20:26:32	Yoshi2	this archive format isn't even that complicated, so I'm not sure what could be causing the trouble
2016-02-23 20:31:27	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-23 20:31:47	Yoshi2	also, GCRebuilder is horrible due to one thing
2016-02-23 20:32:00	@Espyo	can't be bigger, yeah
2016-02-23 20:32:35	Yoshi2	it breaks like on every second rebuild I do and then I have to reopen the folder I am rebuilding
2016-02-23 20:34:11	Yoshi2	I should look into doing this with wiimms tools, I think those can work with gc images too
2016-02-23 20:35:42	@Espyo	uhm
2016-02-23 20:35:44	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2016-02-23 20:37:35	Yoshi2	when rebuilding, it does an "oooops, please mail me info about this image" sometimes

2016-02-23 20:50:21	@Espyo	oh?
2016-02-23 20:51:03	Yoshi2	so instead of adding new model entries, I decided to replace one of the models in the archive with the one I wanted
2016-02-23 20:56:37	Yoshi2	looks a bit ridiculous at the moment but eh

2016-02-24 00:02:49	@PikFan	ok so
2016-02-24 00:03:04	@PikFan	I love your Vehemoth Phosbat at the piano
2016-02-24 00:03:08	@PikFan	and it made me think

2016-02-24 00:04:02	Scruffy	Woha
2016-02-24 00:04:05	Scruffy	Woah*
2016-02-24 00:04:09	Scruffy	Tricky, but doable
2016-02-24 00:04:19	@PikFan	awesome
2016-02-24 00:06:52	Scruffy	So how's it going? I haven't seen you on in a while
2016-02-24 00:06:58	@PikFan	school
2016-02-24 00:07:03	@PikFan	so much school

2016-02-24 00:07:59	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-02-24 00:08:22	Scruffy	Very big
2016-02-24 00:08:29	@PikFan	heavily based on this texture http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/d/d6/Pangaeaultima_a.gtx.png
2016-02-24 00:08:46	@PikFan	but, if you look closely, you may notice some differences

2016-02-24 00:09:11	Scruffy	I do

2016-02-24 00:10:23	Scruffy	Although since it was initially at the presumed north pole, any direction it moved would be south
2016-02-24 00:10:33	@PikFan	I also created a lot of new rifts, like the big one over in the east
2016-02-24 00:10:54	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-24 00:11:12	Scruffy	And compacted a lot of other little islands

2016-02-24 00:11:43	Scruffy	Of course, of course
2016-02-24 00:11:44	@PikFan	I was drawing it off of my 3DS upper screen lol
2016-02-24 00:11:48	Scruffy	Heh
2016-02-24 00:11:59	Scruffy	Wait, you can draw on the upper screen?
2016-02-24 00:12:14	Scruffy	Oh wait, I see what you mean
2016-02-24 00:12:19	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-24 00:12:23	@PikFan	I traced it, I meant
2016-02-24 00:13:53	Scruffy	Well not much to report since I last saw you
2016-02-24 00:14:01	Scruffy	Wait, what am I saying
2016-02-24 00:14:12	Scruffy	I'm going to make my own original game, from scratc
2016-02-24 00:14:15	Scruffy	scratch*
2016-02-24 00:14:21	@PikFan	whoa
2016-02-24 00:14:22	Scruffy	Inspired by Pikmin, but different
2016-02-24 00:14:44	Scruffy	Using entirely open-source free software
2016-02-24 00:14:52	@PikFan	are you actually going to—wow
2016-02-24 00:14:56	Scruffy	If there's something that's not free, it would be for music production
2016-02-24 00:14:59	@PikFan	that's awesome!
2016-02-24 00:15:02	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-02-24 00:15:03	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-02-24 00:15:07	Scruffy	It's really exciting
2016-02-24 00:15:15	@PikFan	so, what's it about?
2016-02-24 00:15:20	Scruffy	I'm taking a bunch of tutorials on game building
2016-02-24 00:16:19	Scruffy	So, there's this colony of ants that one day wakes up with extreme scientific knowledge, so they build a "space colony" (even though space to them is just the sky)
2016-02-24 00:16:53	@PikFan	interesting
2016-02-24 00:16:53	Scruffy	They send probes of forager ants to find food and colonize the Earth, in what they hope will someday be the world's dominant ant supercolony
2016-02-24 00:17:12	Scruffy	The story is minimal in this; I want to focus on the feel and the gameplay
2016-02-24 00:17:31	@PikFan	I see
2016-02-24 00:17:37	Scruffy	You play as two ants, Ripley and Moresby, who search hotspots for nutrients that you carry back to your ship
2016-02-24 00:18:12	Scruffy	It's basically Pikmin without the Pikmin; there are those two leaders who can carry things and direct actions to each other
2016-02-24 00:18:20	Scruffy	And it's all 2D, not top-down
2016-02-24 00:18:34	@PikFan	oh, so like Espyo's engine
2016-02-24 00:18:37	@PikFan	...wait
2016-02-24 00:18:39	@PikFan	OH
2016-02-24 00:18:44	@PikFan	okay, got it now
2016-02-24 00:18:49	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-02-24 00:19:35	Scruffy	The stages are like Mission Mode stages; you have a limited time to collect as many nutrients as you can, and collecting them all means the time remaining is a bonus
2016-02-24 00:19:49	Scruffy	Except everything is going to be digitally hand-painted
2016-02-24 00:20:05	Scruffy	And the characters will be animated not by armatures but by hand
2016-02-24 00:20:21	Scruffy	Very cartoony that way
2016-02-24 00:20:31	Scruffy	But still natural-feeling
2016-02-24 00:21:11	Scruffy	And I'm also going to use a lot of the interesting properties of ants to design what these characters can do
2016-02-24 00:21:40	Scruffy	Such as hormone signals, and interactions between ants and other animals
2016-02-24 00:22:36	Scruffy	I just, have so many ideas
2016-02-24 00:23:02	@PikFan	wow
2016-02-24 00:23:08	@PikFan	it's a lot
2016-02-24 00:23:12	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-24 00:23:23	Scruffy	It'll take longer than I expect, for suer
2016-02-24 00:23:39	Scruffy	but it feels really good to springboard from Pikmin fan material to original material
2016-02-24 00:24:01	Scruffy	Not that I'm done with Pikmin fan art by any means
2016-02-24 00:24:06	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-24 00:24:34	@PikFan	urp
2016-02-24 00:24:43	@PikFan	ugh...
2016-02-24 00:25:08	@PikFan	it seems like every fandom has that one weirdo
2016-02-24 00:26:36	Scruffy	Sorry if this is weird
2016-02-24 00:26:44	@PikFan	no no no no
2016-02-24 00:26:49	@PikFan	I'm not talking about you
2016-02-24 00:26:51	@PikFan	of course not
2016-02-24 00:26:55	Scruffy	oh, hehe
2016-02-24 00:26:57	@PikFan	you're not weird at all
2016-02-24 00:27:01	Scruffy	Well...
2016-02-24 00:27:10	@PikFan	I don't think you're weird
2016-02-24 00:27:11	Scruffy	I don't take it as an insult
2016-02-24 00:27:31	Scruffy	But then who?
2016-02-24 00:27:31	@PikFan	I'm just saying "it seems like every fandom has that one weirdo" because I came across an image depicting...
2016-02-24 00:27:36	@PikFan	well
2016-02-24 00:27:46	@PikFan	Olimar and Louie /in/love/
2016-02-24 00:27:51	@PikFan	I mean
2016-02-24 00:27:55	@PikFan	I have nothing against gays
2016-02-24 00:28:10	@PikFan	but I mean, come on, why would anybody pair Olimar and Louie
2016-02-24 00:28:11	@PikFan	no
2016-02-24 00:28:13	@PikFan	just... no
2016-02-24 00:28:14	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2016-02-24 00:28:44	Scruffy	Yeah, that's just kind of creepy
2016-02-24 00:28:48	@PikFan	I agree
2016-02-24 00:28:51	Scruffy	I don't even know why, but it doesn't work
2016-02-24 00:29:04	@PikFan	it's just... no
2016-02-24 00:29:12	@PikFan	I can't even

2016-02-24 00:31:46	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-24 00:31:50	Neocraftz1553	 4.9
2016-02-24 00:32:26	@PikFan	wow, that's crazy

2016-02-24 00:32:46	@PikFan	thanks Neo
2016-02-24 00:32:54	@PikFan	the earthquake woke me up
2016-02-24 00:33:47	Neocraftz1553	Yeah... I am kinda afraid the San Andreas fault is waking up...

2016-02-24 00:34:54	En_Passant	hi
2016-02-24 00:34:55	Scruffy	Hi En_Passant!
2016-02-24 00:35:01	@PikFan	the whole crew is here now
2016-02-24 00:35:04	Neocraftz1553	Hello, En_Passant
2016-02-24 00:35:05	@PikFan	minus Espyo :(
2016-02-24 00:35:07	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-24 00:35:10	En_Passant	I've figured out what is now my favorite book
2016-02-24 00:35:17	Neocraftz1553	yeah, he's asleep
2016-02-24 00:35:19	@PikFan	what is it?
2016-02-24 00:35:26	En_Passant	The Schwa Was Here
2016-02-24 00:36:01	@PikFan	the schwa? like the pronounciation symbol?
2016-02-24 00:36:10	En_Passant	Yes
2016-02-24 00:36:18	En_Passant	It's the name of a character
2016-02-24 00:36:44	Scruffy	Heh a character in the story or a character of text? :P
2016-02-24 00:36:45	@PikFan	huh
2016-02-24 00:36:59	Neocraftz1553	Sounds cool
2016-02-24 00:37:49	En_Passant	I read it in middle school, but this application I'm doing asks for a "creative work that illustrates the way I see the world and the way I see yourself in the world."
2016-02-24 00:37:59	@PikFan	brb
2016-02-24 00:38:05	En_Passant	The book came to mind and I decided to re-read it
2016-02-24 00:38:34	Neocraftz1553	Nice
2016-02-24 00:41:40	En_Passant	But yeah, the main thing with The Schwa is that he's basically invisible
2016-02-24 00:41:57	Neocraftz1553	how?
2016-02-24 00:42:11	En_Passant	That's the question, really
2016-02-24 00:42:16	En_Passant	It's just the way he is
2016-02-24 00:42:32	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-02-24 00:42:40	Scruffy	I'm guessing that's left ambiguous?
2016-02-24 00:42:40	En_Passant	That's what the whole book is about, really
2016-02-24 00:43:01	Scruffy	Interesting
2016-02-24 00:43:15	Scruffy	And fitting, since the schwa is basically a ghost sound
2016-02-24 00:43:25	Neocraftz1553	yeah, thats the word I'm looking for 
2016-02-24 00:45:34	Neocraftz1553	How much more can Purple Pikmin be nerfed for them to have an Onion?
2016-02-24 00:46:01	UltraMario	do rock ones have an onion
2016-02-24 00:46:07	Scruffy	Yes
2016-02-24 00:46:10	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-24 00:46:12	UltraMario	or winged?
2016-02-24 00:46:15	Scruffy	Yes
2016-02-24 00:46:17	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-02-24 00:46:17	En_Passant	lol
2016-02-24 00:46:25	Neocraftz1553	both of them
2016-02-24 00:46:29	UltraMario	i dont see why purple and white dont have onions
2016-02-24 00:46:31	UltraMario	:p
2016-02-24 00:46:40	@PikFan	because Nintendo logic
2016-02-24 00:46:41	UltraMario	also i hope they're back in pikmin 4
2016-02-24 00:46:42	Scruffy	It was to make them rarer
2016-02-24 00:46:50	UltraMario	and made less rare
2016-02-24 00:46:51	UltraMario	they were neat
2016-02-24 00:46:53	Neocraftz1553	But winged and rocks are both nerfed in a way
2016-02-24 00:47:07	En_Passant	You could still farm them infinitely
2016-02-24 00:47:14	En_Passant	You just couldn't do it as quickly
2016-02-24 00:47:47	Neocraftz1553	but them having Onions... that would be soo cool
2016-02-24 00:48:11	UltraMario	ikr
2016-02-24 00:48:25	Neocraftz1553	How do Rock Pikmin live?
2016-02-24 00:48:38	Neocraftz1553	Just popped into my head
2016-02-24 00:48:52	En_Passant	Like any other Pikmin?
2016-02-24 00:48:58	Scruffy	Like kings
2016-02-24 00:49:04	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-24 00:49:49	Neocraftz1553	But they are Rocks.... well I guess you could have organs inside an uncomfortably hard shell...
2016-02-24 00:50:11	Neocraftz1553	Turtles
2016-02-24 00:50:13	@PikFan	shells
2016-02-24 00:50:17	@PikFan	yeah
2016-02-24 00:50:25	Scruffy	It'd be comfortable though
2016-02-24 00:50:26	Neocraftz1553	Rocks are evolved Turtles :P
2016-02-24 00:50:43	Neocraftz1553	if they were used to it...
2016-02-24 00:51:04	En_Passant	They're rocks their whole lives, mate
2016-02-24 00:51:19	Neocraftz1553	Hey Pikfan, I sent you some renders on Hangouts
2016-02-24 00:51:30	Neocraftz1553	LOL En_Passant
2016-02-24 00:51:37	Scruffy	we're also just assuming the material that makes up their bodies is stone
2016-02-24 00:52:13	En_Passant	Maybe not literal stone, but something rock-like
2016-02-24 00:52:14	Neocraftz1553	then how does the Onion make the Stone?
2016-02-24 00:52:17	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-24 00:52:18	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-24 00:52:20	En_Passant	Shells are definitely the best comparison
2016-02-24 00:52:28	Neocraftz1553	makes sense
2016-02-24 00:53:35	Neocraftz1553	Probably something like Keratin ooor... Calcium
2016-02-24 00:53:40	Neocraftz1553	idk
2016-02-24 00:53:57	En_Passant	Some insanely complex orgo-chem molecule
2016-02-24 00:54:12	Scruffy	That's dense but lightweight
2016-02-24 00:54:23	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-02-24 00:54:44	@PikFan	sorry, playing Splatoon

2016-02-24 00:55:32	Neocraftz1553	Need a quick judge
2016-02-24 00:55:34	Scruffy	My theories on Pikmin has recently reached the conclusion that all the residents of Hocotate and Koppai must have a long history of excellence at basketball
2016-02-24 00:55:56	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-02-24 00:56:25	@PikFan	heh
2016-02-24 00:56:28	Neocraftz1553	or football or something...

2016-02-24 01:11:07	Neocraftz1553	Pikmim Return
2016-02-24 01:11:19	Scruffy	Oooh, cool!
2016-02-24 01:11:39	Neocraftz1553	It has Alph, Brittany, Purple Pikmin, Rock Pikmin, and Red Pikmin
2016-02-24 01:11:59	Scruffy	Nice!
2016-02-24 01:12:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-24 01:12:40	Neocraftz1553	I am almost done with it, surprise, surprise
2016-02-24 01:12:48	Scruffy	neat
2016-02-24 01:13:30	Neocraftz1553	I just need to get some subdivision modifiers done and model the Shards, Bridge, and Bridge Shard Pieces...
2016-02-24 01:14:05	Scruffy	Wow, nice
2016-02-24 01:14:48	Neocraftz1553	the Subdivision modifier is really helpful most of the time..
2016-02-24 01:14:57	Neocraftz1553	but it really lags blender
2016-02-24 01:15:18	Scruffy	Yeah, Blender can only take so many polygon calculations at once
2016-02-24 01:15:28	Neocraftz1553	yeah...
2016-02-24 01:15:58	Neocraftz1553	I can't go past 5 or else blender will crash or the mesh will disappear
2016-02-24 01:16:26	Scruffy	Yeah, I normally don't go past 2
2016-02-24 01:16:59	Neocraftz1553	yeah... I can do 4, but I use 3 if the difference isn't too much
2016-02-24 01:17:21	Neocraftz1553	I use 4 for Pikmin and Captains
2016-02-24 01:17:37	Neocraftz1553	I use 4 for... see what I did there?
2016-02-24 01:17:43	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-02-24 01:18:09	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-02-24 01:18:28	Neocraftz1553	Coincidence? I think not...
2016-02-24 01:18:33	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-02-24 01:19:18	Neocraftz1553	I also added Purple Pikmin Carrying a Purple Pellet with the carry numbers on top
2016-02-24 01:19:28	Scruffy	Heh, neat
2016-02-24 01:19:38	Neocraftz1553	The carrying numbers' texture isn't done yet, though
2016-02-24 01:20:40	Neocraftz1553	I am trying to make it either holographic(I do know how to do) or Crystal-Like(don't know)
2016-02-24 01:21:52	Neocraftz1553	I mean, sure, for the crystal you could use a Glass shader, but it doesn't exactly look how I wanted to...
2016-02-24 01:22:13	Neocraftz1553	IOR 1.2-1.28 is water...
2016-02-24 01:22:25	Neocraftz1553	IOR 1.4-1.5 is Glass...
2016-02-24 01:22:46	Neocraftz1553	And I think IOR 1.65-1.75 is Diamond...
2016-02-24 01:23:28	Neocraftz1553	thats all there is
2016-02-24 01:23:38	Neocraftz1553	 2+ Idk
2016-02-24 01:23:47	Neocraftz1553	.9- idk
2016-02-24 01:24:08	Scruffy	Plenty of things are 2+
2016-02-24 01:24:33	Neocraftz1553	yeah, but I don't know what they are
2016-02-24 01:25:09	Scruffy	Translucent chrome, chromium lenses, hematite glass, lead
2016-02-24 01:25:16	Neocraftz1553	I would do holographic, but that was more of Pikmin 3's thing
2016-02-24 01:25:29	Neocraftz1553	wow, where did you get those names for it?
2016-02-24 01:25:49	Neocraftz1553	I might try hematite glass
2016-02-24 01:26:05	Scruffy	search "ior table," plenty of websites have resources for that
2016-02-24 01:26:14	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks

2016-02-24 19:49:17	Scruffy	Oh, DolphinFX
2016-02-24 19:49:25	Scruffy	It's a shader program for Dolphin

2016-02-24 19:50:26	Scruffy	I didn't expect it to work on this laptop anyway
2016-02-24 19:51:35	@Espyo	so it's its own thing?
2016-02-24 19:51:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-24 19:51:46	@Espyo	because Dolphin has a built-in feature to add shaders

2016-02-24 19:52:30	@Espyo	well, neat
2016-02-24 19:53:07	Yoshi2	I managed to put together a video of the model swapping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvzAXGrIQbo
2016-02-24 19:53:26	Yoshi2	recorded with dolphin's framedump, this time with disabled dual core option
2016-02-24 19:53:51	Yoshi2	in terms of smoothness, you can barely tell it was taken from an emulator
2016-02-24 19:54:40	Yoshi2	(also finally something new I can put in that subreddit for bw modding)
2016-02-24 19:54:50	@Espyo	wow yeah
2016-02-24 19:55:06	@Espyo	remember to also document what you find

2016-02-24 19:55:58	Yoshi2	I do write some stuff about what is happening in the video
2016-02-24 19:56:04	Yoshi2	but to properly document everything
2016-02-24 19:56:14	Yoshi2	I'd need to make a separate post just for that

2016-02-24 20:06:27	Yoshi2	I should do something to make this model swapping easier, because at the moment it involves a bit of manual work
2016-02-24 20:07:08	Yoshi2	e.g. here: https://github.com/RenolY2/battalion-tools/blob/master/res_migration.py#L92 I need to specify the IDs of some textures because the xml file doesn't tell me that the textures are used by this model
2016-02-24 20:08:22	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-02-24 20:08:35	Yoshi2	the model data in the resource archive does mention the textures, which is how I can tell what textures are needed, but I can't parse the model data properly yet
2016-02-24 20:09:00	Yoshi2	I COULD implement it in a hacky way
2016-02-24 20:09:40	Yoshi2	like "if the string XYZ for the texture ABC appears in the model data, add texture ABC as a dependency"
2016-02-24 20:12:14	@Espyo	the longer a project is, the more prone it is to dirty hacks
2016-02-24 20:12:16	@Espyo	embrace the hacks
2016-02-24 20:12:37	Yoshi2	yuuup
2016-02-24 20:12:54	Yoshi2	if it means I get to do model swapping in a much easier way, I should go for it
2016-02-24 20:13:34	Yoshi2	it will also be easier to do for other people
2016-02-24 20:15:49	@Espyo	yes
2016-02-24 20:16:00	@Espyo	but still
2016-02-24 20:16:02	@Espyo	you could like
2016-02-24 20:16:06	@Espyo	write on the code WHY you're doing the hack
2016-02-24 20:16:16	@Espyo	that way if somebody comes and needs to use the code for something else, they'll at least understand
2016-02-24 20:21:19	Yoshi2	if somebody comes
2016-02-24 20:21:51	@Espyo	if somebody comes
2016-02-24 20:22:27	Yoshi2	that is a very big if
2016-02-24 20:24:29	@Espyo	hey, you yourself could always come back to it
2016-02-24 20:26:16	Scruffy	I'll be back in a little bit, but I'm going to record some experiments with the P2 title screen

2016-02-25 18:49:16	Testyo	though maybe Pikmin 2's aaf file contains track information
2016-02-25 18:49:38	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-25 18:52:02	Yoshi2	so I looked again in the xml files at whether there is a correlation between the info written in the xml file and the amount of model/animation/effect entries in the archive
2016-02-25 18:52:13	Yoshi2	pretty sure there is no strong correlation
2016-02-25 18:52:19	Yoshi2	so the game is just being mean to me
2016-02-25 18:52:58	Yoshi2	I might have to go for a Final Solution and clean the level files of all the objects and data, then try to add objects myself
2016-02-25 18:57:07	@Espyo	it's shaping up to be a proper Pikmin 2, in terms of nothing adding up
2016-02-25 18:59:27	Yoshi2	there has to be a reason why I was able to replace existing entries, but adding entries doesn't work
2016-02-25 18:59:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-25 18:59:41	Yoshi2	and I have yet to figure the reason out
2016-02-25 18:59:55	Yoshi2	worst case, it's hardcoded in the game's executable

2016-02-25 20:50:44	@Espyo	my prediction was right
2016-02-25 20:50:55	@Espyo	while making the carrying code for the engine
2016-02-25 20:50:57	@Espyo	I realized something
2016-02-25 20:51:11	@Espyo	there are times where the Pikmin go to the nearest waypoint
2016-02-25 20:51:21	@Espyo	and then do a 180 because that's where the path they need to go goes
2016-02-25 20:51:29	@Espyo	so it's really awkward, they go back and forth
2016-02-25 20:51:40	@Espyo	and I tried to think if that happened in the canon games, and it doesn't
2016-02-25 20:52:13	@Espyo	I figured the game would make the Pikmin take the NEXT waypoint in the path, if they'd have to end up making more than a 90 degree turn left or right
2016-02-25 20:52:13	Testyo	90 degree = 1.5708 rad
2016-02-25 20:52:21	@Espyo	and sure enough... I tested, and that's what's happening
2016-02-25 20:52:28	@Espyo	but I don't know if I should make it like that on the engine
2016-02-25 20:52:30	@Espyo	it's stupid if I don't
2016-02-25 20:52:55	@Espyo	but if I do, there might be times where the path is made in a certain way because the Pikmin DO need to go a certain way, but if this means they'll skip one waypoint and go to the next, it might go wrong...
2016-02-25 20:53:13	@Espyo	hm, I could always implement a check
2016-02-25 20:53:22	@Espyo	if they can't reach the waypoint they want in X seconds, try the original waypoint
2016-02-25 20:53:31	@Espyo	...or I could just stop overengineering
2016-02-25 20:53:44	@Espyo	but the "what ifs" just keep on coming...
2016-02-25 20:54:26	@Espyo	is overengineering even that big of a deal if your project is an engine?
2016-02-25 20:54:32	@Espyo	hey, here's a better idea:
2016-02-25 20:54:38	@Espyo	I don't have TIME to think this through
2016-02-25 20:54:43	@Espyo	I'll just do what's good and move on
2016-02-25 20:54:47	@Espyo	if I need to polish it later, I will

2016-02-26 19:40:19	@Espyo	if it's a screenshot, it asks for the game

2016-02-26 19:40:33	@Espyo	if the game mode is story mode, it also asks for the area
2016-02-26 19:40:34	@Espyo	etc.
2016-02-26 19:40:39	@Espyo	all of this automatically categorizes the image
2016-02-26 19:40:51	@Espyo	it's a few more steps, but it's a LOT better than going through the images and adding categories manualy
2016-02-26 19:40:53	@Espyo	*manually

2016-02-26 20:15:42	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-02-26 20:16:18	Yoshi3	due to my connection breaking or me moving my notebook from one room to another
2016-02-26 20:19:40	Yoshi3	as expected, my first idea did not work, but maybe my second idea will
2016-02-26 20:22:45	@Espyo	ugh
2016-02-26 20:23:03	@Espyo	who'd think that on a machine that can hold 4 gigabytes of random access memory
2016-02-26 20:23:32	@Espyo	having one program using 500 MB and another using 300, and the rest using less than 200 combined means your system is already 95% close to using up all RAM
2016-02-26 20:24:58	Yoshi3	hmmmmmmmmm, this did not work
2016-02-26 20:25:10	Yoshi3	ok, I think I have an idea now
2016-02-26 20:25:17	Yoshi3	I just need to confirm it
2016-02-26 20:28:27	Yoshi3	Espyo: so here is an idea: what if the pointer values in the xml file are actually pointers to data in the archive?
2016-02-26 20:28:55	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-26 20:28:59	@Espyo	they could be so many things...
2016-02-26 20:29:21	Yoshi3	hmmm
2016-02-26 20:29:36	Yoshi3	I knew it was a crazy idea
2016-02-26 20:30:19	Yoshi3	because that is not the case
2016-02-26 20:30:33	@Espyo	hm
2016-02-26 20:30:35	Yoshi3	the pointers really are just IDs in this xml file
2016-02-26 20:30:44	Yoshi3	to reference objects
2016-02-26 20:35:18	Yoshi3	third idea, let's see if that one works

2016-02-26 20:49:13	Yoshi3	nope
2016-02-26 20:50:02	Yoshi3	I can replace the model data directly, but as soon as I rename the model, the game craps its pants
2016-02-26 20:50:16	Yoshi3	it doesn't even matter if I adjust this in the xml files
2016-02-26 20:54:10	Yoshi3	fourth idea: what happens if I leave the name as-is, but dummy out the data

2016-02-26 20:56:57	Yoshi3	ok, dummying out the data is not a good idea, the game just freezes
2016-02-26 20:59:23	Yoshi3	Espyo: can I blame all of this on the executable?
2016-02-26 20:59:46	Yoshi3	it really feels like the executable houses all the secrets
2016-02-26 20:59:50	Yoshi3	even though it shouldn't
2016-02-26 21:00:20	@Espyo	it probably does

2016-02-27 15:28:01	Yoshi2	the executable is taunting me
2016-02-27 15:28:24	Yoshi2	with such things like a shotgun unit type, and a heavy transport unit type
2016-02-27 15:28:40	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-02-27 15:30:51	Yoshi2	and the game has no shotgun unit, and the heavy transports/APCs exist only as textures or in concept art

2016-02-27 16:18:36	Yoshi2	probably is font file, then

2016-02-27 16:36:44	@Espyo	hi
2016-02-27 16:36:50	@Espyo	dude, everybody loved your video
2016-02-27 16:37:01	Scruffy	Yeah this is crazy
2016-02-27 16:37:01	@Espyo	it's interesting and entertaining, for sure
2016-02-27 16:37:13	@Espyo	the music goes so well with it; your mixing was terrific
2016-02-27 16:37:17	Scruffy	I had no idea it'd get this popular
2016-02-27 16:37:21	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-02-27 16:37:22	@Espyo	the graphics and quick and dirty but so charming and effective
2016-02-27 16:37:30	@Espyo	the humor is spot-on and not forced or distracting
2016-02-27 16:37:36	Scruffy	Heh thanks
2016-02-27 16:37:39	@Espyo	man, it's rare to see such quality on a youtube video
2016-02-27 16:37:44	@Espyo	how many views does it have?
2016-02-27 16:37:55	@Espyo	I did share it on the Pikmin subreddit, where it got less-than-deserved attention
2016-02-27 16:38:02	@Espyo	hm, at least the last time I checked, it did
2016-02-27 16:38:08	Scruffy	71
2016-02-27 16:38:19	@Espyo	quite nice
2016-02-27 16:38:40	@Espyo	you could make a bunch more videos of the sort
2016-02-27 16:38:45	@Espyo	like tampering with the Pikmin parameters
2016-02-27 16:38:49	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-27 16:38:56	@Espyo	I'm sure the world would love it
2016-02-27 16:39:02	@Espyo	let me check how many views my enemy tampering video got
2016-02-27 16:39:43	@Espyo	 3 thousand
2016-02-27 16:39:47	Scruffy	The music there was all arrangements of Pikmin music; I didn't want to use official music so I used the music I had made
2016-02-27 16:39:55	@Espyo	wtf, why does my Cavern of Chaos 8 video have FOURTEEN thousand?
2016-02-27 16:40:00	@Espyo	that can't be right
2016-02-27 16:40:07	@Espyo	right, which is smart
2016-02-27 16:40:14	@Espyo	but the way you mixed them amongst the video was also ingenious
2016-02-27 16:40:23	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-02-27 16:40:33	Scruffy	I've had a lot of practice with school projects actually
2016-02-27 16:40:35	@Espyo	...it's been one year since I've made those videos?
2016-02-27 16:40:36	@Espyo	what
2016-02-27 16:40:47	@Espyo	nothing beats practice
2016-02-27 16:47:37	Scruffy	That's a good idea though! I should make some more videos on other parameters like that
2016-02-27 16:48:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-27 16:48:10	Scruffy	It doesn't really explain much about /how/ the game works though, just /what/ works
2016-02-27 16:48:11	@Espyo	they're so fun to watch
2016-02-27 16:48:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-27 16:48:16	Scruffy	That's true
2016-02-27 16:48:22	Scruffy	It was fun to make too
2016-02-27 16:48:25	@Espyo	I bet
2016-02-27 16:51:11	Scruffy	What I really want to make a video on is how music randomization works in the game; I just need to figure that out first
2016-02-27 16:52:34	@Espyo	yeah...

2016-02-27 17:07:09	Yoshi2	knowing how it works is kind of a prerequisite for making a video on how it works, isn't it?
2016-02-27 17:07:48	@Espyo	certainly not
2016-02-27 17:07:54	@Espyo	you can just make a video where you pull stuff out of your ass

2016-02-27 17:20:14	En_Passant	It would require editing the ship's tracks, though
2016-02-27 17:20:23	Scruffy	The ship's tracks?
2016-02-27 17:20:35	En_Passant	Lines

2016-02-27 17:27:41	En_Passant	It would require removing all of its voice lines that occur afterward, and in turn, making the Pluckaphone have to be the last upgrade
2016-02-27 17:28:28	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-02-27 17:28:42	Scruffy	I suppose that could work...
2016-02-27 17:28:58	Scruffy	Although I do really enjoy the dialogue about finding Louie
2016-02-27 17:29:12	Scruffy	I suppose I could try to somehow make the Dream Den /not/ the last cave you visit
2016-02-27 17:29:38	Scruffy	But also, dialogue doesn't have to occur all in one order
2016-02-27 17:29:57	Scruffy	For example, you could get the Pluckaphone and then have a Pikmin suffer a hazard for the first time
2016-02-27 17:30:27	Scruffy	I'd have no way of predicting that unless I remove all the ship's out-of-order dialogues like that

2016-02-27 17:37:48	Scruffy	Like, not just remove its text
2016-02-27 17:37:55	Scruffy	But when you open it it closes
2016-02-27 17:43:43	En_Passant	Maybe the Ship has a back-up voice
2016-02-27 17:45:22	Scruffy	yeah
2016-02-27 17:45:48	Scruffy	it could say its voice is being stolen, and then reboot its backup voice in the same dialogue

2016-02-27 18:07:36	@Espyo	what small object do you see?
2016-02-27 18:08:06	Yoshi2	does a pillow count as a small object?
2016-02-27 18:08:36	@Espyo	too big
2016-02-27 18:09:01	@Espyo	I need a new treasure for the engine
2016-02-27 18:09:04	@Espyo	one that isn't toilet paper
2016-02-27 18:09:11	@Espyo	since nobody seems to see that that thing is a roll of toilet paper
2016-02-27 18:09:25	Scruffy	How about a chew toy?
2016-02-27 18:09:31	@Espyo	hmm
2016-02-27 18:09:35	Yoshi2	why would I have toilet paper to my left
2016-02-27 18:09:35	@Espyo	probably too non-specific
2016-02-27 18:09:45	@Espyo	no, I mean the treasure I have now is toilet paper
2016-02-27 18:09:52	Scruffy	A billiards ball?
2016-02-27 18:09:54	@Espyo	I need to save that out of context
2016-02-27 18:10:02	@Espyo	Testyo: save moment why would I have
2016-02-27 18:10:02	Testyo	Done. I saved the moment <Yoshi2> why would I have toilet paper to my lef.... (Moment #22)
2016-02-27 18:10:09	@Espyo	hey, that's a pretty good idea!
2016-02-27 18:10:14	@Espyo	thanks
2016-02-27 18:10:20	@Espyo	it's round, small, and specific
2016-02-27 18:10:24	Scruffy	No problem
2016-02-27 18:10:41	Yoshi2	plant in a pot
2016-02-27 18:10:50	@Espyo	could also work
2016-02-27 18:10:57	@Espyo	but it'd be weird for them to consider a plant treasure
2016-02-27 18:11:03	@Espyo	when they find so many plants in their adventure already
2016-02-27 18:11:08	Yoshi2	hmm
2016-02-27 18:11:25	Yoshi2	onion in a glass
2016-02-27 18:11:43	@Espyo	getting weirder and weirder

2016-02-27 18:12:13	Yoshi2	chemistry stuff on a plate
2016-02-27 18:12:27	En_Passant	One of the yellow circular ones. Somewhat iconic
2016-02-27 18:12:35	@Espyo	for America :|
2016-02-27 18:12:37	@Espyo	I never heard of those things
2016-02-27 18:12:41	@Espyo	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkertoy this, right?
2016-02-27 18:12:49	@Espyo	anyway, a billiard ball is perfect
2016-02-27 18:12:54	@Espyo	I'll go with that
2016-02-27 18:12:59	@Espyo	not that more ideas would be rejected, no
2016-02-27 18:14:16	Yoshi2	somehow I don't have many things that would make good pikmin treasure
2016-02-27 18:15:05	Yoshi2	bottle, pen, lego brick, flashlight
2016-02-27 18:15:44	Yoshi2	not very circular though
2016-02-27 18:15:51	@Espyo	yeah, it's tough
2016-02-27 18:15:56	Scruffy	Woah
2016-02-27 18:16:19	Scruffy	So, everyone remembers the music on the 1st sublevel of Emergence Cave right?
2016-02-27 18:16:19	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2016-02-27 18:16:28	@Espyo	well, not by heart
2016-02-27 18:16:32	@Espyo	but it does have a song, yeah
2016-02-27 18:16:33	Yoshi2	you could pull a pikmin and add a tank turret
2016-02-27 18:16:38	Scruffy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYpompND69k
2016-02-27 18:16:38	Testyo	69 K = -204.15 °C / -335.47 °F
2016-02-27 18:16:53	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-02-27 18:16:57	Scruffy	It should always start that way
2016-02-27 18:17:04	Scruffy	But I've just changed where it starts
2016-02-27 18:17:08	Scruffy	And I don't know how
2016-02-27 18:17:23	Scruffy	But I think i've at least /found/ the code that controls the randomization
2016-02-27 18:17:34	@Espyo	wow
2016-02-27 18:17:37	@Espyo	that's great, if it's true
2016-02-27 18:17:55	Scruffy	I have no way to make sense of it though
2016-02-27 18:18:11	Scruffy	It's in a format my text editor can't encode properly
2016-02-27 18:18:20	Scruffy	.bms
2016-02-27 18:18:25	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-02-27 18:18:26	@Espyo	what folder?
2016-02-27 18:18:34	Scruffy	Seqs, in AudioRes
2016-02-27 18:18:43	Scruffy	in the file Seq.arc
2016-02-27 18:18:51	@Espyo	all right
2016-02-27 18:18:59	@Espyo	since Inkscape is refusing to load
2016-02-27 18:19:02	@Espyo	might as well go take a look
2016-02-27 18:20:00	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-02-27 18:20:01	@Espyo	that format
2016-02-27 18:20:11	@Espyo	has a LOT of SOH and STX
2016-02-27 18:20:20	@Espyo	no text here
2016-02-27 18:20:26	Yoshi2	yes
2016-02-27 18:20:35	@Espyo	good luck trying to reverse engineer the format
2016-02-27 18:20:37	Yoshi2	you need to use a hex editor
2016-02-27 18:20:45	Yoshi2	to be able to make sense of the content
2016-02-27 18:20:52	@Espyo	every time I tried to reverse engineer a file format, I gave up
2016-02-27 18:20:55	Yoshi2	text editors will fail
2016-02-27 18:20:59	@Espyo	yeah
2016-02-27 18:21:15	Yoshi2	I tried to RE the file format, even got some info about it from a guy who RE'd the format in SMS
2016-02-27 18:21:35	@Espyo	right, this is part of the ones you tampered with
2016-02-27 18:21:39	Yoshi2	but the info from SMS doesn't entirely apply to some of the files in pikmin 2
2016-02-27 18:24:09	Yoshi2	normally, a bms file defines the tracks it contains at the start (opcode 0xC1)
2016-02-27 18:24:24	Yoshi2	but quite a few of the files in pikmin 2 do not do that
2016-02-27 18:24:44	Yoshi2	instead, they have 0xB1 which does idk what
2016-02-27 18:24:54	Yoshi2	the bms files are part of the puzzle to how the music is generated
2016-02-27 18:24:58	Yoshi2	but it's not all of it
2016-02-27 18:25:26	Yoshi2	because the bms files are dynamically interpreted and the game might change stuff as it is being played
2016-02-27 18:25:27	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-02-27 18:25:31	Scruffy	Ah
2016-02-27 18:27:43	Yoshi2	I tried to reverse-engineer the assembler code for a bit, but it was too much for me
2016-02-27 18:27:48	Yoshi2	might try it again some time

2016-02-27 18:43:42	nvortex	wow what?
2016-02-27 18:43:46	Scruffy	Which is why some of the tracks are called "new"
2016-02-27 18:44:26	nvortex	oh i thought it was something like totaka giving instructions about how to make pikmin-fitting music
2016-02-27 18:45:00	Scruffy	Oh heh, I don't think that's what he means here
2016-02-27 18:45:33	nvortex	i was about to say "they clearly didn't follow the instructions for pikmin 3"
2016-02-27 18:47:10	nvortex	why haven't you upoaded the picture of the lipidon to the [nonexistent] lipidon page?
2016-02-27 18:48:05	Scruffy	Oh, because I've forgotten to

2016-02-27 19:09:14	@Espyo	oh, Fates has given controversy recently
2016-02-27 19:09:19	@Espyo	let's piggyback off of it
2016-02-27 19:09:27	@Espyo	Pikmin Birthright and Pikmin Conquest

2016-02-27 19:10:20	Yoshi2	there better be pikmin and olimar petting or I'm not buying it
2016-02-27 19:11:21	nvortex	pikmin birthright and pikmin contest sound interesting but how would we pull that off
2016-02-27 19:11:39	nvortex	just editting pikmin faces to FE characters would be realy cheap
2016-02-27 19:11:50	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> there better be pikmin and olimar petting or I'm not buying it
2016-02-27 19:11:57	@Espyo	obviously we'd make it so that the Japanese version of Pikmin 4 allows petting
2016-02-27 19:12:01	@Espyo	but NoA censored it
2016-02-27 19:12:11	@Espyo	we just make up info about the game
2016-02-27 19:12:29	@Espyo	we could pretend that the game was announced like one week before
2016-02-27 19:12:32	@Espyo	so we only know so much
2016-02-27 19:12:42	@Espyo	but we already know about petting, censorship, being split into two games, etc.
2016-02-27 19:12:46	@Espyo	somebody could probably fake a cover
2016-02-27 19:12:52	@Espyo	*coughScruffycough*
2016-02-27 19:12:55	nvortex	i don't know anything about fire emblem so i wouldn't be so much of a help
2016-02-27 19:13:09	@Espyo	you don't need to know much
2016-02-27 19:13:18	@Espyo	all you need to know is that for the latest game in the series, Fire Emblem Fates
2016-02-27 19:13:26	@Espyo	the Japanese version allows you to pet your units

2016-02-27 19:13:37	@Espyo	but they removed that for the American release
2016-02-27 19:13:57	@Espyo	the American release also got a few other things censored, and the localization of some scripts was pretty heavily changed for no good reason
2016-02-27 19:14:00	@Espyo	so it's causing a ruckus
2016-02-27 19:14:31	nvortex	can you "hide" a page or something so we start working on it right now and make it public in april 1?
2016-02-27 19:14:52	@Espyo	afraid not
2016-02-27 19:15:18	nvortex	then word docuent i guess
2016-02-27 19:15:22	@Espyo	I mean, I think I can hide it, but nobody will be able to see it because... it's hidden

2016-02-28 16:52:15	Yoshi2	ok, the music is pretty generic military themed music
2016-02-28 16:55:25	Yoshi2	it's not bad, but I can't tell what level each music piece belongs to simply by listening
2016-02-28 17:00:27	@J	what a nice sentence, Testyo
2016-02-28 17:00:29	Testyo	but I did so on the skype group

2016-02-28 19:26:22	Yoshi2	time to get started with reading the info on how to create an article
2016-02-28 20:16:02	Yoshi2	I need to replace the title screen somebody uploaded for BW2 on tcrf, that one is not in the native resolution
2016-02-28 20:17:45	Yoshi2	ok, this is fun
2016-02-28 20:18:12	Yoshi2	BW2 on the Wii actually has a worse resolution than BW1 on the GC
2016-02-28 20:19:04	Yoshi2	unless I'm missing something
2016-02-28 20:19:47	Yoshi2	with the internal resolution set to native in dolphin, and the window size set to fixed, BW1 screenshots are 640x480
2016-02-28 20:19:54	Yoshi2	BW2 screenshots are 640x360
2016-02-28 20:20:11	Yoshi2	so to make it widescreen, instead of rendering more, they are rendering less
2016-02-28 20:29:24	Yoshi2	ah, BW2 screenshots can be 640x480 too if the tv mode is set to 4:3 instead of 16:9
2016-02-28 20:30:48	Yoshi2	so the developers were very lazy and didn't do a proper widescreen mode
2016-02-28 20:43:50	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right...
2016-02-28 20:48:08	Yoshi2	I am not sure why they did it like this, but they did it

2016-02-28 20:49:06	Yoshi2	the other option is that dolphin derped and the resolution is lower than it should be
2016-02-28 20:49:49	Yoshi2	and I'm putting my faith into dolphin and saying that the game actually runs at 640x360 when doing 16:9, and 640:480 when doing 4:3
2016-02-28 20:50:54	nvortex	what is bw?
2016-02-28 20:51:00	Yoshi2	with 640x480 being definitely the native resolution because I just compared one of the images I extracted from the resource archives to the same image in the screenshot
2016-02-28 20:51:04	Yoshi2	battalion wars

2016-02-28 20:55:17	Yoshi2	I don't think the game has a very big following, so I am hijacking this channel sometimes for rambling on about it

2016-02-28 21:22:17	@Espyo	if you go to the page of the image

2016-02-28 22:06:47	Yoshi2	what's there to discuss? If it's a wii game and the picture resolution is over 1000 pixels in width, then clearly the picture doesn't have the correct resolution

2016-02-29 18:54:55	Scruffy	I've just installed a well-reviewed hex editor and plugged in one of the cave music .bms files from Pikmin 2
2016-02-29 18:55:15	Scruffy	I don't know much about hex but I do realize it stored a lot more information than a text editor could shwo
2016-02-29 18:55:33	Scruffy	I'm just having trouble understanding what all these bytes are supposed to tell you

2016-02-29 19:03:04	Scruffy	I've just started learning about it
2016-02-29 19:03:12	@Espyo	there's nothing to it
2016-02-29 19:03:21	@Espyo	but most of the knowledge DOES come from practice
2016-02-29 19:03:27	@Espyo	well, most of the understanding
2016-02-29 19:03:46	@Espyo	ok, as for the bytes you're seeing in the file, they could mean pretty much anything...
2016-02-29 19:03:56	@Espyo	it all depends on how Nintendo made the format, really
2016-02-29 19:04:04	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-02-29 19:04:13	@Espyo	they could decide that C4 is the code for an instruction
2016-02-29 19:04:47	@Espyo	the next 4 bytes are the parameters of the instruction
2016-02-29 19:04:54	@Espyo	C4 could mean "an instruction is coming next"
2016-02-29 19:04:58	@Espyo	 00 could be the ID of the instruction
2016-02-29 19:04:59	Yoshi2	I could try digging out the pdf file a guy who RE'd the format for sunshine gave me, that had a bit of info about the format
2016-02-29 19:05:06	@Espyo	 00, 01, 5D could be data about it

2016-02-29 19:06:27	Scruffy	Ah, okay
2016-02-29 19:07:16	Yoshi2	I also mostly figured out how to parse the bms files myself, but I don't know the point of a lot of the stuff
2016-02-29 19:07:42	Scruffy	So that's what parsing is...
2016-02-29 19:09:59	@Espyo	parsing is pretty much "reading and making something out of it" :P
2016-02-29 19:10:31	Scruffy	Yeah

2016-02-29 19:41:12	Neocraftz1553	Hey, Scruffy, how did you make the Wolly Bulborb's Texture?
2016-02-29 19:41:16	Yoshi2	I made my code in such a way that it can support SMS, Zelda WW, Pikmin 1 and Pikmin 2 without having lots of duplicate code, so not all of the code in that file applies to Pikmin 2
2016-02-29 19:41:40	Neocraftz1553	*Woolly
2016-02-29 19:42:08	Scruffy	Yoshi2: right
2016-02-29 19:42:18	Scruffy	Neocraftz1553: the skin or the hair?
2016-02-29 19:43:31	Neocraftz1553	The SKin
2016-02-29 19:45:37	Scruffy	Okay, get ready for this
2016-02-29 19:46:38	Neocraftz1553	yeah?
2016-02-29 19:46:50	Scruffy	I have the regular color texture for the Red Bulborb and the specular color texture for the Orange Bulborb
2016-02-29 19:47:24	Neocraftz1553	mhmm
2016-02-29 19:47:45	Scruffy	The Orange Bulborb specular texture I modify so that its saturation is half but its value is twice as much
2016-02-29 19:47:57	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-29 19:48:17	Neocraftz1553	So it is brownish
2016-02-29 19:48:35	Scruffy	I mix those two colors, with a factor of a noise texture
2016-02-29 19:48:59	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-02-29 19:49:00	Scruffy	The noise texture is UV mapped on the Bulborb, and rotated -90 degrees on the Z axis
2016-02-29 19:49:00	Testyo	-90 degrees = -1.5708 rad
2016-02-29 19:49:11	Scruffy	It has a scale of 5 and a detail level of 2
2016-02-29 19:49:14	Neocraftz1553	So it is made in blender
2016-02-29 19:49:28	Scruffy	Then I doubled its contrast so the difference is sharper
2016-02-29 19:49:47	Scruffy	So, I have that mix of two image textures by a noise texture
2016-02-29 19:49:51	Scruffy	Then I mix /that/
2016-02-29 19:50:10	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-29 19:50:12	Scruffy	with the Woolly Bulborb's vertex paint
2016-02-29 19:50:33	Scruffy	which I painted myself; it's all black except for a small bit of brown on the tip of the snout
2016-02-29 19:50:45	Neocraftz1553	oh, I don't know how to use vertex paint :P
2016-02-29 19:50:54	Scruffy	It's tricky, but useful
2016-02-29 19:51:08	Scruffy	Anyway I combine the texture and vertex paint through a Color mix node set to "darken"
2016-02-29 19:51:09	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-02-29 19:51:18	Scruffy	The texture darkening the paint
2016-02-29 19:51:36	Scruffy	And that result is the color for the Diffuse and Glossy shaders
2016-02-29 19:51:44	Scruffy	mixed 75% diffuse
2016-02-29 19:52:09	Scruffy	And then mixed with a Subsurface Scattering node with the same color and a scale of .2
2016-02-29 19:52:27	Scruffy	again 75% Diffuse/Glossy, 25% SSS
2016-02-29 19:52:33	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-02-29 19:52:35	Scruffy	And that becomes the material
2016-02-29 19:52:51	Scruffy	Oh, and I used the Bulborb normal texture for the normal map on everything
2016-02-29 19:54:07	Neocraftz1553	Oh, ok, I'll try to replicate that
2016-02-29 19:54:18	Neocraftz1553	Uh, how did you model the hair
2016-02-29 19:54:48	Scruffy	Using the Particle/Hair section

2016-02-29 19:57:42	Neocraftz1553	How did you make it wirey?
2016-02-29 19:58:14	Scruffy	First I created a vertex group on the Bulborb so the hair would only grow on its back
2016-02-29 19:58:51	Scruffy	Then I created a hair system, and I had to change some of Cycles' rendering settings so that it would appear at a thickness other than 0

2016-02-29 21:23:37	Yoshi2	which means the order of the models doesn't matter
2016-02-29 21:27:17	Neocraftz1553	nice

2016-02-29 22:21:44	@Espyo	because you linked the image page
2016-02-29 22:21:49	Neocraftz1553	Anything else?
2016-02-29 22:21:50	@Espyo	so it's trying to embed it like an image
2016-02-29 22:21:58	@Espyo	other than that, the pellets look pretty weird
2016-02-29 22:22:01	@Espyo	maybe not wrong, but weird
2016-02-29 22:22:07	@Espyo	certainly different from what we see in the canon games
2016-02-29 22:22:10	Neocraftz1553	Shiny, perhaps?
2016-02-29 22:22:14	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2016-02-29 22:22:16	@Espyo	bubbly
2016-02-29 22:22:20	Klemen702	sticking out of the pellets

2016-02-29 22:23:03	Neocraftz1553	I am keeping that style, even if it does look sorta weird
2016-02-29 22:23:16	Klemen702	i bet one could get used to it
2016-02-29 22:23:23	Neocraftz1553	with time
2016-02-29 22:23:26	Klemen702	oh and
2016-02-29 22:23:28	Klemen702	the background
2016-02-29 22:23:29	Klemen702	it sucks
2016-02-29 22:23:39	Neocraftz1553	yes, I know

2016-02-29 22:23:55	Klemen702	otherwise it looks pretty good
2016-02-29 22:24:01	Neocraftz1553	I will use an HDRI later
2016-02-29 22:24:05	Klemen702	what i like the most about it
2016-02-29 22:24:12	Klemen702	is that you can tell that they are just models
2016-02-29 22:24:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-02-29 22:24:24	Klemen702	which is what i loved about the first pikmin in general
2016-02-29 22:24:28	Klemen702	no atmosphere
2016-02-29 22:24:32	Klemen702	just an obvious model
2016-02-29 22:24:40	Neocraftz1553	They are actually the models from P3

2016-02-29 22:25:47	Neocraftz1553	And with the HDRI, it is going to take about an hour and a half
2016-02-29 22:26:05	Neocraftz1553	It took 43 mins and 37 secs

2016-02-29 23:06:07	Scruffy	I tried implementing the ship's speech so that he can't say anything upon collection of the Professional Noisemaker, but unfortunately it causes problems with the rest of the text in the game
2016-02-29 23:06:15	Scruffy	It's very finicky and I don't know hwy

2016-02-29 23:07:44	Scruffy	I think so... what exactly do you mean by back-up voice? I want to make sure I'm doing this right

2016-02-29 23:14:26	En_Passant	You still steal his voice when you get the Professional Noisemaker
2016-02-29 23:14:35	En_Passant	But he had another voice in reserve just in case that happened
2016-02-29 23:14:54	Scruffy	Oh, yes, I've got that written out
2016-02-29 23:15:32	Scruffy	I can show you the dialogue if you wish

2016-02-29 23:17:08	En_Passant	I don't know if Dolphin will ever work on my computer, so might as well

2016-02-29 23:18:38	Scruffy	And that's all the space there is in that dialogue
2016-02-29 23:19:09	Scruffy	The upgrade would be called Back-up.vox

2016-02-29 23:21:49	En_Passant	1) there's two spaces there 2) there's no file extension 3) if that's not a file extension, the sentence cuts off
2016-02-29 23:22:38	Scruffy	Oh, heh, the space is a line break
2016-02-29 23:22:54	Scruffy	Some of the text streams in here have random spaces before the line breaks
2016-02-29 23:23:17	Scruffy	And ".vox" is the file format
2016-02-29 23:23:23	Scruffy	I forgot the period after it
2016-02-29 23:24:12	Scruffy	The full sentence is "Running SarcasmOS in Back-up.vox."
2016-02-29 23:30:23	En_Passant	okay
2016-02-29 23:30:42	En_Passant	It was pretty funny
2016-02-29 23:31:13	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-02-29 23:32:04	Scruffy	It's really going to develop my quippy writing skills to rewrite all the Piklopedia and Treasure Hoard articles
2016-02-29 23:33:23	En_Passant	Does Olimar have a new personality as well?
2016-02-29 23:33:30	Scruffy	I'm not sure yet
2016-02-29 23:33:44	Scruffy	Certainly he's not going to be as serious in the Piklopedia
2016-02-29 23:34:00	Scruffy	And will let his feelings about the enemy into his descriptions of them

2016-02-29 23:38:56	Scruffy	Oh, I wanted to ask you, should the caves have new names?
2016-02-29 23:39:15	Scruffy	And if they do, should they suggest the cave they were originally?
2016-02-29 23:41:19	En_Passant	If I had to pick a side, I'd say no. Since the caves are randomly generated, names don't carry a whole lot of meaning

2016-03-01 19:42:23	Yoshi2	8 hours, wow
2016-03-01 19:42:38	Yoshi2	I already went crazy when compiling dolphin, and that took maybe one hour
2016-03-01 19:43:20	ScruffyChat	Well this is just eight hours of slowly watching the render finish
2016-03-01 19:43:40	ScruffyChat	It calculates it in 16*16 squares
2016-03-01 19:43:48	ScruffyChat	16 pixels*
2016-03-01 19:47:40	Yoshi2	how much time does it roughly take per 16x16 pixels?
2016-03-01 19:49:41	Yoshi2	alternatively, what is the resolution of the render?
2016-03-01 19:49:50	Yoshi2	could probably calculate the average from that
2016-03-01 19:51:09	ScruffyChat	Well, everyone says 16*16 is the fastest, for a 1920*1200 pixel render
2016-03-01 19:51:27	ScruffyChat	But time also depends on the complexity of the scene, the number of samples per pixel, and so forth
2016-03-01 19:52:00	ScruffyChat	So 8 hours might not even be an accurate estimate; the render contains quite a bit of empty space that doesn't take as long
2016-03-01 19:52:01	Yoshi2	mhm, I can imagine that

2016-03-01 19:54:53	Yoshi2	so for 1920*1200 and 8 hours total, it would be 18.75 16*16 squares per minute
2016-03-01 19:55:12	Yoshi2	not too bad, I guess you can watch progress pretty well like that
2016-03-01 19:55:15	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-01 19:56:09	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately I have a smoke simulation; I think that causes the time estimate to be off its mark
2016-03-01 19:56:23	ScruffyChat	It takes a very long time to render smoke, even square by square

2016-03-01 21:09:05	Neocraftz1553	Hello Espyo, Yoshi2
2016-03-01 21:09:16	Yoshi2	wb neo
2016-03-01 21:09:30	Neocraftz1553	Can you guys do me a favor?
2016-03-01 21:09:53	Neocraftz1553	give me some feedback on the Beady long legs render that I made, please
2016-03-01 21:10:37	Yoshi2	what's the link to the render?
2016-03-01 21:11:02	Neocraftz1553	http://miburl.com/EHCDp4 
2016-03-01 21:11:03	Neocraftz1553	There
2016-03-01 21:12:26	--	AFKazooie is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-03-01 21:16:36	Yoshi2	the ground and the trees seem to be a bit dark, feels a bit odd seeing pikmin fight a boss when it is rather dark
2016-03-01 21:17:06	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-01 21:17:19	Yoshi2	and somehow, I think olimar isn't looking in the direction of the long legs monster
2016-03-01 21:17:20	Neocraftz1553	That is actually mid-day
2016-03-01 21:17:59	Neocraftz1553	It's Alph, I think I should make him look up or something
2016-03-01 21:18:13	Neocraftz1553	Uh, Espyo, what do you think?
2016-03-01 21:18:49	Yoshi2	that's pretty dark for mid-day
2016-03-01 21:19:02	Yoshi2	feels more like the sun is just rising or going down
2016-03-01 21:20:27	Neocraftz1553	Hence the name, "Twilight Forest" : )
2016-03-01 21:20:37	Neocraftz1553	It is pretty dark
2016-03-01 21:20:50	Yoshi2	needs more forest then :>
2016-03-01 21:20:56	Neocraftz1553	Twilight throughout the whole day
2016-03-01 21:21:00	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-01 21:21:12	Neocraftz1553	I am doing a render of that part
2016-03-01 21:21:31	Neocraftz1553	It is the "second" part
2016-03-01 21:21:44	Neocraftz1553	Like the Garden of Hope in Pikmin 3
2016-03-01 21:22:01	Neocraftz1553	That is the marshy part of the area
2016-03-01 21:22:20	Neocraftz1553	Espyo isn't responding, so I'll ask Testyo :P
2016-03-01 21:22:21	Testyo	only really call like 1 hour a day or so
2016-03-01 21:22:42	Yoshi2	Testyo: is neo's render good?
2016-03-01 21:22:43	Testyo	mm, I guess? Like I said, I don't really know what's going on Pikipedia
2016-03-01 21:22:45	Neocraftz1553	anything else, Yoshi2?
2016-03-01 21:23:05	Neocraftz1553	about the render
2016-03-01 21:23:40	Neocraftz1553	The render used to be brighter, as seen in the previous versions
2016-03-01 21:23:55	Yoshi2	the scale might be a bit messed up with the trees in the background
2016-03-01 21:23:58	Yoshi2	1 m
2016-03-01 21:23:59	Testyo	1 m = 1.0936 yd / 3.2808 ft / 52.6316 Olimar-heights
2016-03-01 21:24:11	@Espyo	pong
2016-03-01 21:25:12	@Espyo	hm, it looks quite nice
2016-03-01 21:25:18	@Espyo	hard to pick something that's wrong in it
2016-03-01 21:25:20	@Espyo	it looks good
2016-03-01 21:25:26	@Espyo	although Alph could be looking at the fight
2016-03-01 21:25:31	@Espyo	instead of into the distance
2016-03-01 21:25:57	@Espyo	Alph's beacon is also too erect
2016-03-01 21:26:00	@Espyo	and not emitting enough light
2016-03-01 21:27:49	Yoshi2	I feel like the trees in the background, if adjusted for the perspective, are too big, but maybe I'm wrong
2016-03-01 21:28:28	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-01 21:29:17	Neocraftz1553	I put lots of attention to the Beady Long Legs, everything else I just made without muh detail :P
2016-03-01 21:29:22	Neocraftz1553	Like Alph
2016-03-01 21:29:35	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-01 21:29:59	@Espyo	but detail should be a way to flourish the image, not just a way to empower what's already powerful
2016-03-01 21:30:19	Neocraftz1553	If you can zoom in, you can see I used a bump map on the Beady Long Legs
2016-03-01 21:30:42	Neocraftz1553	It is kinda noticable on its body
2016-03-01 21:31:01	Yoshi2	hm, yes
2016-03-01 21:31:05	Yoshi2	the body looks nice
2016-03-01 21:31:12	Neocraftz1553	I used the Pikmin's leaves on the trees...
2016-03-01 21:31:22	Yoshi2	but the legs are still pretty ugly :s
2016-03-01 21:32:01	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I know
2016-03-01 21:32:13	Neocraftz1553	 1. they are a little too thin
2016-03-01 21:32:34	Neocraftz1553	 2. the image and the bump map doesn't wrap around it nicely
2016-03-01 21:33:02	Neocraftz1553	the leg that is getting picked up...
2016-03-01 21:33:07	Yoshi2	the texture is stretched accross the legs in weird ways
2016-03-01 21:33:15	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-01 21:33:32	Neocraftz1553	the leg that is getting picked up is kinda sqaurish
2016-03-01 21:33:49	Neocraftz1553	The light doesn't get reflected evenly
2016-03-01 21:33:57	Neocraftz1553	well, it does
2016-03-01 21:34:09	Neocraftz1553	but it is pretty polygon-ish
2016-03-01 21:34:33	Neocraftz1553	The segments of the legs have....
2016-03-01 21:34:36	Neocraftz1553	hair.
2016-03-01 21:34:51	Neocraftz1553	barely visible, but it is there
2016-03-01 21:35:23	Yoshi2	the ankles have hair that looks odd from a distance
2016-03-01 21:35:30	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-01 21:35:37	Neocraftz1553	it looks odd at any distance
2016-03-01 21:36:17	Neocraftz1553	I am trying to make the hair look a little bit more thick
2016-03-01 21:36:29	Neocraftz1553	but I do not know how to do it in blender yet
2016-03-01 21:37:07	Neocraftz1553	I might delete the health counter above the long legs, since it is mostly covered
2016-03-01 21:37:18	Neocraftz1553	by a flying blue pikmin...
2016-03-01 21:37:43	Neocraftz1553	I might replace the trees with grass :P
2016-03-01 21:38:07	Yoshi2	mhm, grass would probably be easier to do right
2016-03-01 21:38:35	Yoshi2	I'll go to bed now, night
2016-03-01 21:39:06	Neocraftz1553	ok, night
2016-03-01 21:39:18	Neocraftz1553	or maybe dandelions...
2016-03-01 21:39:24	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-03-01 21:39:29	Neocraftz1553	They look kinda like trees
2016-03-01 21:39:56	Neocraftz1553	what do you think I should use, Espyo?
2016-03-01 21:40:04	Neocraftz1553	any flora that comes to mind?
2016-03-01 21:40:58	Neocraftz1553	oh no...
2016-03-01 21:41:57	Neocraftz1553	dammit
2016-03-01 21:42:22	Neocraftz1553	I forgot to save the render with dandelions and grass and stuff in it >.<
2016-03-01 21:43:31	Neocraftz1553	I'll have to upload it tommarrow
2016-03-01 21:56:53	@Espyo	flora for that pic, eh?
2016-03-01 21:57:13	@Espyo	hm, I can't really imagine much that would fit there
2016-03-01 21:57:23	@Espyo	but since there are some trees nearby, I'd say some fallen leaves
2016-03-01 22:01:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-01 22:01:13	Neocraftz1553	I might leave the trunks there, make them thicker
2016-03-01 22:01:36	Neocraftz1553	Then I might re-color the leaves in some way
2016-03-01 22:01:41	Neocraftz1553	yeah, that could work
2016-03-01 22:01:50	Neocraftz1553	thanks for the feedback gtg

2016-03-02 19:13:44	Yoshi2	and there is data for putting together those tiles into a level
2016-03-02 19:14:10	Yoshi2	so if you wanted, you could really mess up the level geometry by messing with that data
2016-03-02 19:14:35	Yoshi2	which I will sometime make a video about
2016-03-02 19:15:39	Neocraftz1553	I really want to sign in to the Pikipedia forums...
2016-03-02 19:16:02	Neocraftz1553	but I forgot my password, and the recover password thing doesn't want to wwork
2016-03-02 19:17:08	ScruffyChat	Sure Neo, I could give some feedback

2016-03-02 20:26:29	Neocraftz1553	I would want to represent either the Whistful Wild, Final Trail, or Formidable Oak
2016-03-02 20:26:38	Neocraftz1553	or teh Forest Navel
2016-03-02 20:26:49	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I'd represent the Forest Navel

2016-03-02 20:28:27	ScruffyChat	Oh, the only other feedback I had was to increase the brightness of the lights

2016-03-02 20:28:37	ScruffyChat	That'll help all parts of the render
2016-03-02 20:28:49	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks
2016-03-02 20:28:53	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-03-02 20:29:11	ScruffyChat	If you've got sunny weather, you can look around natural areas for lighting reference
2016-03-02 20:29:31	ScruffyChat	Unless you want an area to look rainy

2016-03-02 20:31:30	Neocraftz1553	the renders should be out in a few days, then I'll fix some problems from the other renders

2016-03-02 20:32:12	Neocraftz1553	Good, Bad, or otherwise?
2016-03-02 20:32:24	ScruffyChat	I really like how you've posed all the Blue Pikmin
2016-03-02 20:33:25	ScruffyChat	Perhaps tone down the bump mapping a little on the Beady Long Legs
2016-03-02 20:33:25	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I like paying attention to the Pikmin... I make most of them in individual poses

2016-03-02 20:33:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah, bump mapping can create harsh shadows

2016-03-02 20:34:01	ScruffyChat	But again, brightening it will fix that as well

2016-03-02 21:45:35	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks!
2016-03-02 21:45:58	@Espyo	uhm, wait, what...?
2016-03-02 21:46:10	@Espyo	the pile of bridge fragments for the dark blue bridge... doesn't exist
2016-03-02 21:46:26	Neocraftz1553	oh...
2016-03-02 21:46:28	@Espyo	I think this is the bridge you see in prerelease images, anyway
2016-03-02 21:46:36	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-02 21:46:41	@Espyo	well, what about I get you the model for the light blue bridge and fragments?
2016-03-02 21:46:48	Neocraftz1553	light blue will have to do
2016-03-02 21:47:08	Neocraftz1553	I could always change the color anyways
2016-03-02 21:47:17	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-02 21:47:17	ScruffyChat	Blender can always change— yeah
2016-03-02 21:49:47	Neocraftz1553	I think you will get the most use out of it, Scruffy
2016-03-02 21:50:15	Neocraftz1553	For your Pikmin Forever bridge renders
2016-03-02 21:50:39	@Espyo	...

2016-03-02 21:52:14	Neocraftz1553	What file are you in?
2016-03-02 21:52:19	@Espyo	all right, dark blue bridge a go
2016-03-02 21:52:26	@Espyo	almost all objects in P3 have two files
2016-03-02 21:52:39	@Espyo	a normal file, and an "_indirect" file
2016-03-02 21:52:47	@Espyo	the standard file is the models and textures
2016-03-02 21:52:50	@Espyo	what I SHOULD'VE opened
2016-03-02 21:52:55	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-03-02 21:52:57	@Espyo	the _indirect is in-game statistics
2016-03-02 21:52:58	@Espyo	like health and such
2016-03-02 21:53:01	@Espyo	which is what I DID open
2016-03-02 21:53:03	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see
2016-03-02 21:54:46	@Espyo	https://www.dropbox.com/s/umys0arzlowe5fv/Blue%20bridge.zip?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/y8v3xzkuu0q8smn/Blue%20fragment%20pile.zip?dl=0 that should do it
2016-03-02 21:54:53	Neocraftz1553	you're the one who puts up most of the stats on Piklopedia, right?
2016-03-02 21:55:43	Neocraftz1553	did you put the models in "Pikmin 3 models"?
2016-03-02 21:56:03	@Espyo	I did
2016-03-02 21:56:12	@Espyo	and the stats on Piklopedia? what do you mean?
2016-03-02 21:56:15	@Espyo	did you mean Pikipedia?
2016-03-02 21:56:18	@Espyo	if so, yeah, I do that
2016-03-02 21:56:53	Neocraftz1553	yeah Pikipedia
2016-03-02 21:57:34	Neocraftz1553	I put "Piklopedia" instead of "Pikipedia" sometimes :p
2016-03-02 21:57:45	@Espyo	quite a few people do
2016-03-02 21:58:12	Neocraftz1553	good, so I'm not the only one

2016-03-02 22:31:42	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-02 22:31:54	Neocraftz1553	wow
2016-03-02 22:31:58	Neocraftz1553	that is awsome
2016-03-02 22:32:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I'm going to parody the course intros for Mario Kart 8, but in a fictional Pikmin karting game
2016-03-02 22:32:22	Neocraftz1553	it looks like something legit!
2016-03-02 22:33:22	ScruffyChat	Thanks!
2016-03-02 22:33:47	ScruffyChat	Most of it I just literally scrapped off the Hocotate ship
2016-03-02 22:33:59	ScruffyChat	Except the central engine component and the tires
2016-03-02 22:34:10	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-03-02 22:34:25	Neocraftz1553	It really looks like something out of a game

2016-03-02 22:41:04	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-02 22:41:24	ScruffyChat	If this became a game, I would probably make it "Pikmin Kart U" or something like that
2016-03-02 22:41:40	ScruffyChat	Since the other fan game was before Pikmin 3
2016-03-02 22:41:59	Neocraftz1553	so its on the Wii?
2016-03-02 22:42:30	Neocraftz1553	the other game
2016-03-02 22:43:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-02 22:43:28	Neocraftz1553	"Pikmin Kart U" sounds like "Piktamin U"
2016-03-02 22:43:31	ScruffyChat	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_Kart
2016-03-02 22:43:44	Neocraftz1553	Thanks for the link
2016-03-02 22:44:27	Neocraftz1553	heh Steve the Red Pikmin
2016-03-02 22:45:03	Neocraftz1553	Chuggaconroy said that once...
2016-03-02 22:46:59	Neocraftz1553	It kinda makes me sad that Pikmin is not very well-known
2016-03-02 22:47:42	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-02 22:48:50	Neocraftz1553	and this generation only plays games like CoD
2016-03-02 22:49:04	ScruffyChat	Heh, I only really play non-violent
2016-03-02 22:49:14	Neocraftz1553	really?
2016-03-02 22:49:14	ScruffyChat	Or, at least, as non-violent as Pikmin is
2016-03-02 22:49:20	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 22:49:32	Neocraftz1553	that really puts it in perspective
2016-03-02 22:49:44	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I'll occasionally play violent games if my brother joins, but on my own I stick to non-violent games
2016-03-02 22:49:57	ScruffyChat	I enjoy puzzles more than action, and I think they mesh well
2016-03-02 22:50:07	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-02 22:50:58	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin is pretty morbid if you really pay attention to how the Pikmin get eaten and how the onion grinds up theenemy corpses...
2016-03-02 22:51:18	Neocraftz1553	especially in the first game, my favorite...
2016-03-02 22:51:57	Neocraftz1553	...If you don't get at least 25 important parts, you die, and nobody kniws your dead...
2016-03-02 22:52:17	Neocraftz1553	but its a great strategy game
2016-03-02 22:53:08	Neocraftz1553	the most violent game I've played is CoD: MW3
2016-03-02 22:53:35	Neocraftz1553	most frightening game: FNAF 1... in my opinion
2016-03-02 22:54:16	Neocraftz1553	FNAF 2 & 4 aren't as morbid as FNAF 1's death screen...
2016-03-02 22:54:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I loved it but it gave me legitimate nightmares for weeks
2016-03-02 22:54:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I know...
2016-03-02 22:55:43	Neocraftz1553	Springtrap isscary as well, but you better look him up in the FNAF Wiki
2016-03-02 22:55:52	ScruffyChat	I've seen all that
2016-03-02 22:55:59	Neocraftz1553	yeah...
2016-03-02 22:56:19	Neocraftz1553	ok, this jut turned from Pikmin Kart, to FNAF
2016-03-02 22:56:28	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 22:56:39	ScruffyChat	hehe
2016-03-02 22:56:51	ScruffyChat	speaking of Pikmin Kart, I need 12 karts and 12 characters to fill them
2016-03-02 22:57:05	ScruffyChat	I have the Hocotate Special and now its gold variant, the Hocotate Extra
2016-03-02 22:57:39	Neocraftz1553	Did anyone say a silver variant?
2016-03-02 22:57:47	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-03-02 22:57:59	Neocraftz1553	I know of 12 characters

2016-03-02 23:00:01	Neocraftz1553	just kidding :p
2016-03-02 23:00:11	ScruffyChat	Haha
2016-03-02 23:00:21	ScruffyChat	I actually thought of Five Laps at Freddy's once
2016-03-02 23:00:32	ScruffyChat	But I couldn't think of anywhere for them to drive
2016-03-02 23:00:33	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-03-02 23:00:40	Neocraftz1553	I know
2016-03-02 23:01:00	Neocraftz1553	unless they were small, in the Pizzeria
2016-03-02 23:02:11	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, how about a Silver variant?
2016-03-02 23:02:22	Neocraftz1553	of the Hocotate Special
2016-03-02 23:02:34	Neocraftz1553	named Hocotate Super
2016-03-02 23:02:53	ScruffyChat	mmm it's not based off something in the canon Pikmin though
2016-03-02 23:03:03	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-02 23:03:07	ScruffyChat	Plus you can get a gold kart body in MK8, but not a silver one
2016-03-02 23:03:22	Neocraftz1553	ok, the S.S. Dolphin
2016-03-02 23:03:37	Neocraftz1553	but I don't know where you could get the model...
2016-03-02 23:03:41	ScruffyChat	I will make one based on that
2016-03-02 23:03:46	ScruffyChat	I don't need the model
2016-03-02 23:03:50	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-02 23:03:54	ScruffyChat	I've already built all the parts before
2016-03-02 23:04:02	@Espyo	the S.S. Dolphin might exist on The Models Resource
2016-03-02 23:04:10	@Espyo	GEEZ, I just left my visual studio window for one second
2016-03-02 23:04:14	@Espyo	and I'm seeing it behind this window
2016-03-02 23:04:18	@Espyo	it's giving hundreds of errors
2016-03-02 23:04:32	ScruffyChat	I've checked; the only thing on the Models Resource for P1 is the giant unused Mario model
2016-03-02 23:04:33	@Espyo	see, visual studio has this thing where it automatically marks invalid code with a red squiggly underline, in real-time
2016-03-02 23:04:40	Neocraftz1553	heheh
2016-03-02 23:04:43	@Espyo	unfortunately, if you leave like an open ( that is never closed
2016-03-02 23:04:57	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-03-02 23:04:58	@Espyo	it just sees that EVERYTHING after it invalid code

2016-03-02 23:08:56	Neocraftz1553	I could've sworn I saw it after you rescue Olimar in the formidable oak...
2016-03-02 23:09:12	Neocraftz1553	and for some reason I saw it in the Tropical Wilds...
2016-03-02 23:09:53	Neocraftz1553	I dont know, just have a feeling
2016-03-02 23:10:28	ScruffyChat	I feel like everyone in Pikmin 3 is trying to tell Olimar to accept the Hocotate ship as the new S.S. Dolphin, and he doesn't want to
2016-03-02 23:11:13	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-02 23:11:44	Neocraftz1553	It was kinda sad to see it destroyed though...
2016-03-02 23:11:51	Neocraftz1553	It died, in short
2016-03-02 23:13:02	@Espyo	I tried to compile the code
2016-03-02 23:13:14	@Espyo	it gave one or two errors in completely unrelated places
2016-03-02 23:13:22	@Espyo	and it's not stuff like an unclosed parenthesis
2016-03-02 23:13:37	@Espyo	which could explain the whole "all code after this is part of the parenthesis since you never closed it, and hence is wrong" deal
2016-03-02 23:13:46	@Espyo	but it STILL has red squigglies everywhere
2016-03-02 23:13:48	@Espyo	it refuses to update
2016-03-02 23:13:58	@Espyo	gaaaaaaahhhh this program is so trash
2016-03-02 23:14:07	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 23:14:25	Neocraftz1553	sometimes programs seem to have minds of their own
2016-03-02 23:14:55	@Espyo	some more than others
2016-03-02 23:15:04	@Espyo	Testyo never has a mind of his own
2016-03-02 23:15:05	Testyo	BTW, full rights Diff?
2016-03-02 23:15:12	@Espyo	oh god, run away, he wants full rights
2016-03-02 23:15:12	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 23:15:35	@Espyo	.........the parts that ARE wrong are the ones that don't have squigglies
2016-03-02 23:16:13	Neocraftz1553	Wait, for what are you useing the program for?
2016-03-02 23:16:30	@Espyo	visual studio is the program that transforms code into a program
2016-03-02 23:16:36	@Espyo	so, I'm working on the engine
2016-03-02 23:16:49	Neocraftz1553	Oh, I thought so
2016-03-02 23:17:14	Neocraftz1553	So everything isn't going well :p
2016-03-02 23:17:56	Neocraftz1553	Right, Testyo
2016-03-02 23:17:56	Testyo	there it '.*?'?
2016-03-02 23:18:58	@Espyo	just the usual, really
2016-03-02 23:19:03	@Espyo	it's never smooth
2016-03-02 23:19:26	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-02 23:20:45	Neocraftz1553	off topic, but I used to think that Bulborbs and Bulbears threw Pikmin up into the air and then ate them as they fell into their mouth
2016-03-02 23:22:14	Neocraftz1553	thanks to a gameplay video

2016-03-02 23:23:12	@Espyo	...I can't remember if I've seen this before
2016-03-02 23:23:17	@Espyo	my code compiled, meaning it's 100% ok
2016-03-02 23:23:24	@Espyo	but the file is still almost entirely red squiggles
2016-03-02 23:23:33	@Espyo	and it's still processing the file
2016-03-02 23:23:40	@Espyo	even though it already marked everything as red and isn't doing anything
2016-03-02 23:23:44	@Espyo	so...it's just acting stupid
2016-03-02 23:23:53	@Espyo	I see it act stupid every day, but it's always something different
2016-03-02 23:23:57	@Espyo	this is today's stupidity
2016-03-02 23:24:13	Neocraftz1553	it uses different brands of stupidity
2016-03-02 23:25:26	Neocraftz1553	it likes to mix it up, to keep you on your toes

2016-03-02 23:32:28	Neocraftz1553	not really sure if that was a joke or not
2016-03-02 23:33:33	Neocraftz1553	I should've said "No, this is Patrick"
2016-03-02 23:33:49	Neocraftz1553	or This is Sparta or something like that :p

2016-03-02 23:35:01	Neocraftz1553	I'm too shy as well :|
2016-03-02 23:35:11	ScruffyChat	The S.S. Drake is criminally high-poly
2016-03-02 23:35:29	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 23:35:43	Neocraftz1553	in blender? use subdivision surface
2016-03-02 23:37:08	ScruffyChat	IT HAS MORE POLYGONS THAN THE ENTIRE PERPLEXING POOL
2016-03-02 23:37:16	ScruffyChat	Without subdivision surface
2016-03-02 23:37:24	Neocraftz1553	hahaha
2016-03-02 23:37:49	Neocraftz1553	thats a pretty big comparison
2016-03-02 23:37:52	@Espyo	what a time to be alive
2016-03-02 23:38:18	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 23:39:02	Neocraftz1553	I have to save this log :p
2016-03-02 23:40:47	Neocraftz1553	Subdivision surface is great, but it increases the risk of blender crashing
2016-03-02 23:42:05	Neocraftz1553	I mean, Tropical Plains model view is more laggy than Sunset Island rendered view
2016-03-02 23:43:06	Neocraftz1553	thats saying something
2016-03-02 23:43:41	Neocraftz1553	it even crashes when rendering, so I had to use 25 samples

2016-03-02 23:46:22	ScruffyChat	That's odd
2016-03-02 23:46:34	ScruffyChat	Why would Tropical Plains be so laggy?
2016-03-02 23:47:09	Neocraftz1553	I'm not even sure
2016-03-02 23:47:33	Neocraftz1553	maybe because I used subdivision surface 3 on the pikmin flowers
2016-03-02 23:47:41	ScruffyChat	That'd do it
2016-03-02 23:47:49	Neocraftz1553	 0 in viewport mode
2016-03-02 23:47:51	ScruffyChat	I never go above two on my Subdivisions
2016-03-02 23:47:53	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-03-02 23:48:12	Neocraftz1553	you leave subdivision surface on?
2016-03-02 23:48:22	ScruffyChat	Yes sometimes
2016-03-02 23:48:42	Neocraftz1553	put it 0 in view port mode when you want to move around
2016-03-02 23:49:00	Neocraftz1553	and to increase rendering speeds...
2016-03-02 23:49:22	Neocraftz1553	Put tiles 16 at least, 32 at most...
2016-03-02 23:49:30	Neocraftz1553	 8 increases time
2016-03-02 23:49:55	Neocraftz1553	 16 is faster than 32, but could crash renders if they are too complex...
2016-03-02 23:50:01	Neocraftz1553	 32 is slower than 16
2016-03-02 23:50:17	Neocraftz1553	 20, blender has trouble with
2016-03-02 23:50:51	Neocraftz1553	turn on BVH cache and spatial split(is that what its called)
2016-03-02 23:51:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-02 23:51:55	Neocraftz1553	Filter Glossy and Clamps will sometimes crash blender, and .50 Filter Glossy will give you more serious Fireflies than 0
2016-03-02 23:52:55	Neocraftz1553	leave the resolution at 100%, 50% is faster, but if you want quality, go with 100
2016-03-02 23:53:23	Neocraftz1553	resolution will do nothing to affect crashes, I have found
2016-03-02 23:53:50	Neocraftz1553	aaand.... I think thats it...
2016-03-02 23:54:31	Neocraftz1553	Use HDRIs...
2016-03-02 23:55:00	Neocraftz1553	Have you used Pro lighting: Skies from blenderguru?
2016-03-02 23:55:10	Neocraftz1553	I got the demo.... its pretty good
2016-03-02 23:57:26	ScruffyChat	I have not
2016-03-02 23:57:46	Neocraftz1553	try it out
2016-03-02 23:58:04	Neocraftz1553	I have used it in the beady long legs render
2016-03-02 23:58:30	Neocraftz1553	the demo only comes with 3 backgrounds, though...
2016-03-02 23:58:45	Neocraftz1553	and the Lite costs 97 bucks :V
2016-03-02 23:59:00	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-02 23:59:03	Neocraftz1553	but try it out, it is awsome
2016-03-02 23:59:06	ScruffyChat	That's the trouble
2016-03-02 23:59:15	Neocraftz1553	you could change the size of the sun 
2016-03-02 23:59:19	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-02 23:59:30	ScruffyChat	Is it unlimited or a limited time?
2016-03-02 23:59:37	ScruffyChat	And can you save your blends with it?
2016-03-02 23:59:42	Neocraftz1553	unlimited :D
2016-03-02 23:59:56	Neocraftz1553	yeah you could save em
2016-03-03 00:00:43	Neocraftz1553	it is everything the Lite and Ultimate versions are, exept with only 3 backgrounds
2016-03-03 00:00:51	Neocraftz1553	not that bad, atlctually
2016-03-03 00:02:05	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-03 00:02:12	ScruffyChat	That'd be useful, I'll try it out
2016-03-03 00:03:11	Neocraftz1553	oh, just one thing
2016-03-03 00:03:39	Neocraftz1553	You have to use an email, then it'll get mailed to you...
2016-03-03 00:03:50	Neocraftz1553	then you download both .zips
2016-03-03 00:04:18	Neocraftz1553	then add the add-on folder to blenders add-on folder
2016-03-03 00:04:32	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2016-03-03 00:04:35	ScruffyChat	I'll do that later
2016-03-03 00:04:44	Neocraftz1553	then you go into Blender>preferences>add-ons
2016-03-03 00:05:00	Neocraftz1553	then click install HDRIs from .zip
2016-03-03 00:05:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah, its kinda complicated
2016-03-03 00:05:21	Neocraftz1553	but I did it in 10 mins, so...
2016-03-03 00:05:26	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-03 00:08:43	Neocraftz1553	why is it 97 dollars??
2016-03-03 00:09:06	Neocraftz1553	and 120 dolars??
2016-03-03 00:12:33	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-03 00:12:40	Neocraftz1553	wrll they are pretty good
2016-03-03 00:12:54	Neocraftz1553	it is a resonable price...
2016-03-03 00:13:15	Neocraftz1553	but the price is going up after March 3rd, 2016
2016-03-03 00:13:23	ScruffyChat	Aww man
2016-03-03 00:14:13	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I know
2016-03-03 00:14:46	Neocraftz1553	wait wait wait wait... WHAT?
2016-03-03 00:15:03	Neocraftz1553	 197 dollars for the Ultamite version???
2016-03-03 00:15:12	Neocraftz1553	that stuffs not cheap...
2016-03-03 00:17:44	Neocraftz1553	I bet Lite is going to be $110 and Ultamite is going to be 215 after tommarrow... or more
2016-03-03 00:19:15	Neocraftz1553	ah, well
2016-03-03 00:20:12	Neocraftz1553	hey Espyo, what are you up to

2016-03-03 00:20:40	Neocraftz1553	I didn't notice until now
2016-03-03 00:25:12	Neocraftz1553	Why is everything so expensive these days
2016-03-03 00:25:46	Neocraftz1553	A small hybrid Solenopsis nest costs $50 on the AntsCanada store...
2016-03-03 00:29:29	Neocraftz1553	hey Scruffy
2016-03-03 00:30:42	Neocraftz1553	what do you think a Skitterleaf shaped kinda like Ivy would do
2016-03-03 00:30:57	Neocraftz1553	Scruffychat?
2016-03-03 00:31:00	ScruffyChat	Hi sorry

2016-03-03 15:07:49	Chiaki_Nanami	what do you feel about Italy stealing so much coastline from you
2016-03-03 15:07:50	Klemen702	it's just that alot of people confuse them
2016-03-03 15:07:54	Klemen702	because of the names
2016-03-03 15:08:03	Klemen702	those Italians are dirty robbers
2016-03-03 15:08:09	Klemen702	gib trieste

2016-03-03 15:09:38	Klemen702	eh
2016-03-03 15:09:46	Klemen702	right now not many of them are likeable
2016-03-03 15:11:31	Klemen702	but i don't have much of a reaction to Montenegro and Macedonia because i don't know them much
2016-03-03 15:11:33	Chiaki_Nanami	which neighbouring country do you like the most
2016-03-03 15:11:36	Chiaki_Nanami	or rather
2016-03-03 15:11:38	Chiaki_Nanami	dislike the least
2016-03-03 15:11:42	Klemen702	Austria 
2016-03-03 15:13:14	Chiaki_Nanami	the closest I've been to Slovenia was when I was to Budapest one time
2016-03-03 15:14:01	Klemen702	do you travel alot?
2016-03-03 15:14:13	Chiaki_Nanami	no lol

2016-03-03 15:15:41	Klemen702	i visited Croatia and Italy before but that's about it
2016-03-03 15:16:28	Chiaki_Nanami	how is the refugee crisis treating you
2016-03-03 15:16:59	Klemen702	haven't heard about it much recently
2016-03-03 15:17:16	Klemen702	but from what i heard people just stay here for a few days and then leave
2016-03-03 15:18:27	Chiaki_Nanami	oh
2016-03-03 15:18:35	Chiaki_Nanami	I suppose they're heading for Germany
2016-03-03 15:18:57	Klemen702	yeah
2016-03-03 15:20:01	Klemen702	althrough
2016-03-03 15:20:06	Klemen702	they would have to pass Austria
2016-03-03 15:20:16	Klemen702	and i heard there are some border problems there recently
2016-03-03 15:20:41	Chiaki_Nanami	and otherwise they'd have to get across Hungary and Poland and that's not happening
2016-03-03 15:20:44	Klemen702	not exactly sure if it has to do with the refugees
2016-03-03 15:20:50	Chiaki_Nanami	oh, and Slovakia
2016-03-03 15:20:55	Chiaki_Nanami	or the Czech Republic
2016-03-03 15:21:34	Klemen702	Hungary doesn't allow them in i think?
2016-03-03 15:21:39	Chiaki_Nanami	yeah
2016-03-03 15:21:42	Chiaki_Nanami	all due to Orban
2016-03-03 15:29:51	Chiaki_Nanami	so question
2016-03-03 15:30:21	Chiaki_Nanami	How many languages are mutually intelligible to you?
2016-03-03 15:31:40	Klemen702	i don't understand what ''mutually intelligible'' means
2016-03-03 15:31:49	Chiaki_Nanami	ok so
2016-03-03 15:31:52	Chiaki_Nanami	it's like
2016-03-03 15:32:14	Chiaki_Nanami	people from country A who speak language X can understand people from country B who speak language Y and vice-versa
2016-03-03 15:32:49	Klemen702	well
2016-03-03 15:33:04	Klemen702	i talked with a Croatian girl once
2016-03-03 15:33:16	Klemen702	i'm not sure if she knew Slovene but i understood her mostly
2016-03-03 15:34:51	Klemen702	one time when i went to Koper and found a thing to readm i saw it was in Slovenian and Croatian. so i decided to compare them
2016-03-03 15:34:56	Klemen702	they were close
2016-03-03 15:35:04	Chiaki_Nanami	Koper?
2016-03-03 15:35:11	Klemen702	one of the cities near the sea
2016-03-03 15:35:15	Chiaki_Nanami	oh
2016-03-03 15:36:37	Chiaki_Nanami	wouldn't Serbian be close to Slovene too
2016-03-03 15:36:50	Klemen702	i also had a Czech guy say some things once and it was less similar
2016-03-03 15:36:56	Klemen702	i haven't seen much Serbian
2016-03-03 15:36:57	Chiaki_Nanami	disregarding the whole Latin alphabet versus Cyrillic alphabet thing
2016-03-03 15:37:34	Klemen702	one thing i can tell tho
2016-03-03 15:37:47	Klemen702	is that we have the same keyboards for the latin alphabet
2016-03-03 15:37:53	Klemen702	i can type ć and đ but we don't use it
2016-03-03 15:38:01	Chiaki_Nanami	oh
2016-03-03 15:38:25	Chiaki_Nanami	why are they not used
2016-03-03 15:38:31	Chiaki_Nanami	also I can't type that d thing
2016-03-03 15:38:35	Chiaki_Nanami	I can type ć though
2016-03-03 15:38:56	Klemen702	idk why
2016-03-03 15:38:56	Yoshi2	ääääääööööööööööüüüüüüüüüüüüüäßßßöößßßääää

2016-03-03 15:40:26	Klemen702	c, s and z are so fancy that they stole v's little brother and used him as a hat

2016-03-03 15:41:14	Klemen702	actually
2016-03-03 15:41:21	Klemen702	i could type alot of those letters
2016-03-03 15:41:29	Klemen702	by pressing alt + a random number
2016-03-03 15:41:32	Klemen702	and then a letter
2016-03-03 15:42:11	Klemen702	é ´and e

2016-03-03 15:47:31	Chiaki_Nanami	yeah it's kind of late
2016-03-03 15:47:33	Klemen702	i have to go to sleep earlier because school begins earlier tommorow
2016-03-03 15:47:41	Chiaki_Nanami	rip D:
2016-03-03 15:48:03	Yoshi2	it's at 11 pm my time, pretty late
2016-03-03 15:48:17	Yoshi2	ah, it says that already in the tweet
2016-03-03 15:48:40	Klemen702	the weirdest part about time zones
2016-03-03 15:48:43	Klemen702	is that
2016-03-03 15:48:47	Klemen702	UK is literally above Spain
2016-03-03 15:48:52	Klemen702	and yet Spain has 1 hour+
2016-03-03 15:50:52	Chiaki_Nanami	yeah lol
2016-03-03 15:50:57	Chiaki_Nanami	timezones
2016-03-03 15:52:53	Yoshi2	timezones are just lol
2016-03-03 15:54:28	Klemen702	http://www.statsagogo.com/timezone/timezone16.gif
2016-03-03 15:54:33	Klemen702	look at greenland
2016-03-03 15:54:48	Klemen702	the most confusing part of all is there
2016-03-03 15:55:08	Klemen702	there are these little bits that barely make any sense
2016-03-03 15:57:07	Chiaki_Nanami	like what
2016-03-03 15:57:21	Klemen702	on the right of greenland
2016-03-03 15:57:43	Klemen702	do you see the dark green and red colors next to each other?
2016-03-03 15:57:53	Klemen702	instead of it being 1 hour more
2016-03-03 15:57:55	Klemen702	it's 2 hours
2016-03-03 15:58:02	Klemen702	and they are literally next to each other
2016-03-03 15:58:39	Chiaki_Nanami	yeah
2016-03-03 15:58:40	Chiaki_Nanami	lol
2016-03-03 15:59:05	Klemen702	and i doubt anyone would live ontop of those parts instead of the bottom
2016-03-03 15:59:12	Chiaki_Nanami	look at Russia
2016-03-03 15:59:57	Klemen702	wow
2016-03-03 16:00:14	Klemen702	i just noticed the little green spots between the white and dark green
2016-03-03 16:00:35	Klemen702	and Mongol has 2 timezones for no reason...
2016-03-03 16:17:03	Klemen702	gonna go
2016-03-03 16:17:08	Klemen702	see you in 43 min
2016-03-03 16:17:08	Klemen702	cya
2016-03-03 16:17:12	<--	Klemen702 (Mibbit@86.61.yk.gh) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-03-03 16:17:18	Yoshi2	that's oddly specific
2016-03-03 16:17:53	Chiaki_Nanami	not really when you realise that in 43 minutes, it'll be 18:00
2016-03-03 16:18:01	Chiaki_Nanami	so it's just saying 'be back at 6'
2016-03-03 16:18:20	Chiaki_Nanami	which wouldn't be considered as oddly specific even though it's the same thing
2016-03-03 16:18:49	Chiaki_Nanami	you just have a predisposition towards times that end with 00, 15, 30 or 45
2016-03-03 16:18:53	Chiaki_Nanami	that's all
2016-03-03 16:19:34	Yoshi2	I did think about that, but there is some difference between saying "be back at 6" and "be back in 43 minutes"
2016-03-03 16:20:03	Yoshi2	considering that if you wait just one minute, 43 minutes won't be correct anymore
2016-03-03 16:20:17	Chiaki_Nanami	no but here's the thing
2016-03-03 16:20:35	Chiaki_Nanami	it's 43 minutes relative to the time at which he said it
2016-03-03 16:20:50	Yoshi2	no but I mean if you were the one who write it
2016-03-03 16:21:07	Yoshi2	if you end up waiting too long, the 43 minutes won't be correct anymore
2016-03-03 16:21:21	Yoshi2	*who writes it
2016-03-03 16:21:23	Chiaki_Nanami	and then you can say you're early
2016-03-03 16:21:26	Chiaki_Nanami	win-win
2016-03-03 16:21:45	Yoshi2	it's just additional trouble for little reason
2016-03-03 16:21:49	Chiaki_Nanami	no
2016-03-03 16:21:59	Chiaki_Nanami	it's personality
2016-03-03 16:22:52	Yoshi2	he could've also said "be back in an hour"
2016-03-03 16:22:59	Yoshi2	returned early
2016-03-03 16:23:01	Yoshi2	everybody is happy
2016-03-03 16:23:02	Chiaki_Nanami	again, it's personality
2016-03-03 16:23:04	Yoshi2	yoshi2 is happy
2016-03-03 16:23:14	Yoshi2	what do you mean by "it's personality"?
2016-03-03 16:23:15	Chiaki_Nanami	i liked it
2016-03-03 16:24:07	Chiaki_Nanami	isn't it obvious??
2016-03-03 16:24:26	Yoshi2	not really, no
2016-03-03 16:24:53	Yoshi2	unless you mean that it's part of his personality to be specific like that
2016-03-03 16:25:14	Yoshi2	which I'd disagree with because I haven't seen klemen do that ever before

2016-03-03 17:21:16	Klemen702	it seems 43 min wasn't accurate
2016-03-03 17:22:46	Chiaki_Nanami	64 minutes
2016-03-03 17:22:50	Chiaki_Nanami	that's a factor of 2
2016-03-03 17:22:52	Chiaki_Nanami	even better
2016-03-03 17:23:02	Yoshi2	it wasn't really necessary to be that specific anyway
2016-03-03 17:23:23	Klemen702	nah it was just cuz it usually ends at that time
2016-03-03 17:23:38	Yoshi2	you could've said "I'll be back in about an hour" and it would be accurate enough ( °▽ °) 
2016-03-03 17:23:54	Yoshi2	what ends at that time?
2016-03-03 17:24:35	Klemen702	17 minutes is more than you think it is
2016-03-03 17:24:44	Klemen702	and what ended was a guy coming to my house
2016-03-03 17:24:48	Klemen702	guest
2016-03-03 17:25:09	Yoshi2	why would somebody leave at exactly 18:00
2016-03-03 17:25:32	Klemen702	business sort of
2016-03-03 17:26:22	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-03-03 17:28:34	Yoshi2	regular guests probably wouldn't leave on exactly 18:00, at least I wouldn't :>

2016-03-03 17:35:06	Klemen702	i wonder who and how that was figured out
2016-03-03 17:35:17	Chiaki_Nanami	it's easy
2016-03-03 17:35:30	Chiaki_Nanami	I just typed a number that uses each number an equal amount of times
2016-03-03 17:36:00	Chiaki_Nanami	and since 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 is divisible by 9, the full number is divisible by 9
2016-03-03 17:36:36	Klemen702	clever cookie
2016-03-03 17:37:28	Chiaki_Nanami	oh and inserting a 0 anywhere does not change a number's divisibility by 9
2016-03-03 17:37:54	Chiaki_Nanami	123456789 is divisible by 9, and 100000230540009000070000068000000 is also divisible by 9
2016-03-03 17:40:57	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is any number where inserting a 0 makes it not divisible by a different number
2016-03-03 17:41:46	Chiaki_Nanami	7
2016-03-03 17:42:06	Chiaki_Nanami	divisibility of 7 is a difficult topic
2016-03-03 17:42:24	Yoshi2	130 is divisible by 13, 1030 is not divisible by 13
2016-03-03 17:42:27	Yoshi2	mystery solved

2016-03-03 18:59:44	@Espyo	yeah, it's part of the Deluxe package
2016-03-03 18:59:56	@Espyo	he also has vacuuming functions in that package
2016-03-03 19:00:10	Klemen702	neat
2016-03-03 19:00:13	Klemen702	how much does it cost

2016-03-03 19:07:35	Yoshi2	I uploaded the video with 2x the resolution in hopes so that youtube doesn't mess it up, so as a side effect there is a 720p option available
2016-03-03 19:10:52	@Espyo	neat
2016-03-03 19:10:57	@Espyo	looks good, too
2016-03-03 19:11:08	@Espyo	just one question
2016-03-03 19:16:30	Yoshi2	Espyo: what question?
2016-03-03 19:16:44	@Espyo	where's your courage, commander?
2016-03-03 19:16:59	Yoshi2	oh joy
2016-03-03 19:17:07	Yoshi2	I AM working on that
2016-03-03 19:17:20	Yoshi2	need to find a way to disable the boundary checking
2016-03-03 19:17:29	Yoshi2	it isn't as easy in bw1 as it is in bw2, sadly

2016-03-03 19:18:14	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-03-03 19:18:30	@Espyo	here's a better solution: find the voice clip and remove it
2016-03-03 19:18:33	@Espyo	hi Scruffy
2016-03-03 19:18:53	Yoshi2	that's not a better solution
2016-03-03 19:19:00	@Espyo	it's not as useful
2016-03-03 19:19:02	@Espyo	but it's funner
2016-03-03 19:19:02	Yoshi2	because I'm still teleported back
2016-03-03 19:19:05	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-03 19:19:12	@Espyo	I didn't see any teleportation on the video
2016-03-03 19:19:20	Yoshi2	it happens
2016-03-03 19:19:25	Yoshi2	the screen goes black for a bit
2016-03-03 19:19:40	Yoshi2	and then I end up inside the map boundary again
2016-03-03 19:19:47	Yoshi2	instead of outside
2016-03-03 19:20:12	@Espyo	right
2016-03-03 19:20:25	Yoshi2	I noticed that when dialogue is going on, the teleporting back is delayed
2016-03-03 19:20:25	@Espyo	so, Dark Lord Revan finally came back from the dead
2016-03-03 19:20:37	@Espyo	heard my request for the Pikipedia facebook page 
2016-03-03 19:20:39	@Espyo	and gave me it
2016-03-03 19:20:43	@Espyo	I'm not the admin of the page, but I am an editor
2016-03-03 19:20:51	Yoshi2	nice
2016-03-03 19:21:19	@Espyo	doesn't really matter much, but I don't feel very comfortable having him around as the admin of the page, since he's still "loyal" to both wikis
2016-03-03 19:21:29	@Espyo	he could snap, join the dark side, and do nasty things to the page
2016-03-03 19:21:40	Yoshi2	now we just need to come up with some dank memes and pikipedia will go viral
2016-03-03 19:21:45	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-03 19:25:38	Klemen702	you don't need to come up with any
2016-03-03 19:25:41	Klemen702	just pacha edit it
2016-03-03 19:47:05	@Espyo	J, you there?
2016-03-03 20:09:00	Yoshi2	ok, I am a sad panda now
2016-03-03 20:09:30	Yoshi2	none of the scripts in the level archive are about level boundaries
2016-03-03 20:09:51	Yoshi2	at least none that sound like they are about level boundaries
2016-03-03 20:13:10	@Espyo	welp
2016-03-03 20:13:16	@Espyo	is there a time limit before you get teleported?
2016-03-03 20:13:26	@Espyo	you could find the address that ticks down the timer and freeze it
2016-03-03 20:18:06	Yoshi2	pretty sure there is no time limit, it's just a matter of some code being executed when the dialogue is over
2016-03-03 20:21:11	@Espyo	right
2016-03-03 20:40:39	@J	hi
2016-03-03 20:40:50	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-03 20:41:08	@Espyo	here's the thing, I'm trying to decide between Ubuntu and Lubuntu
2016-03-03 20:41:09	@Espyo	got any advice?
2016-03-03 20:41:30	@Espyo	looks to me like Lubuntu is basically Ubuntu, just with a lighter overall theme and window manager
2016-03-03 20:41:35	@Espyo	which I can get behind
2016-03-03 20:41:38	Yoshi2	I like lubuntu
2016-03-03 20:42:02	@J	it's just the interface and default applications that are different
2016-03-03 20:42:12	@J	either can become the other with changes to installed packages
2016-03-03 20:42:17	@Espyo	but I'm worried about stuff like "oh yeah, we made an Ubuntu release for this package, get it here: XXX" "oh whoops sorry, Lubuntu is just different enough that it won't work there lol"
2016-03-03 20:42:28	@Espyo	right, figured as much
2016-03-03 20:42:29	@J	they use the same repos for base stuff
2016-03-03 20:42:30	@Espyo	that's a relief
2016-03-03 20:42:34	@J	so same exact packages
2016-03-03 20:42:38	@Espyo	good
2016-03-03 20:42:39	@Espyo	thank you
2016-03-03 20:42:51	@J	I use some LXDE programs in my setup, actually
2016-03-03 20:43:04	Yoshi2	worst case, you compile it yourself because it's linux and compiling stuff is not as much of a pain as on windows
2016-03-03 20:43:20	@J	where I don't have a desktop manager, just a window manager and various applications
2016-03-03 20:43:22	@Espyo	hm, yeah...
2016-03-03 20:43:33	@Espyo	no desktop manager...
2016-03-03 20:43:40	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-03 20:44:09	@J	actually maybe it's just lxappearance I use, though I did try lxpanel at one point
2016-03-03 20:44:52	@Espyo	right
2016-03-03 20:45:06	@Espyo	I really want to try to squeeze the most out of performance this time around
2016-03-03 20:45:16	@Espyo	I was never one for fancy graphics if it means slowing things down
2016-03-03 20:45:30	@J	it doesn't really, on modern hardware
2016-03-03 20:45:45	@J	because it'll all be on the GPU, and you don't care about that for most applications
2016-03-03 20:46:03	@Espyo	right, and when playing a game, it's a good idea to give it exclusive access to the GPU
2016-03-03 20:46:03	Yoshi2	lubuntu does come with less stuff out of the box, so the image size is smaller
2016-03-03 20:46:04	@Espyo	but even STILL
2016-03-03 20:46:14	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think I'll need most of it
2016-03-03 20:46:16	@J	in fact, a window manager without any GPU acceleration might be a bit slower
2016-03-03 20:46:19	@Espyo	and if I do, sudo apt-get install, hah!
2016-03-03 20:46:34	@Espyo	I can only imagine it is
2016-03-03 20:46:42	@Espyo	I think Aero, windows's thing, is hardware accelerated
2016-03-03 20:46:51	@J	the real place where you'll notice a difference is in your choice of applications
2016-03-03 20:47:18	@J	not over the system as a whole so much, unless you do crazy stuff
2016-03-03 20:47:19	@Espyo	oh, really?
2016-03-03 20:47:23	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-03 20:47:25	@Espyo	I guess so
2016-03-03 20:47:38	@J	well, yeah, lightweight stuff will usually be faster, especially startup times
2016-03-03 20:47:48	@Espyo	right
2016-03-03 20:47:51	@J	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications this has a nice list
2016-03-03 20:47:53	@Espyo	ugh, startup times... my worst nemesis
2016-03-03 20:48:15	@Espyo	woah I didn't expect something so long
2016-03-03 20:48:23	@Espyo	this'll be a fun read
2016-03-03 20:48:24	@Espyo	thanks
2016-03-03 20:48:31	@Espyo	wonder how up-to-date this is
2016-03-03 20:49:01	@Espyo	...oh
2016-03-03 20:49:07	@Espyo	HexChat DOES work on Linux
2016-03-03 20:49:10	@Espyo	well now I feel stupid
2016-03-03 20:49:14	@Espyo	all this time I thought it didn't
2016-03-03 20:50:14	@Espyo	console-based image viewers kind of defeats the purpose
2016-03-03 20:50:47	@Espyo	I guess it means they're summoned by the command line instead of being a "classic" windows-like program that automatically opens when you double-click a file of that type in an "explorer" window
2016-03-03 20:51:13	@J	no, those ones are for viewing images when you don't have a GUI
2016-03-03 20:51:19	@J	eg. on a server when you're too lazy to SCP
2016-03-03 20:51:39	@Espyo	but it'll open a GUI window with the image, right?
2016-03-03 20:51:42	@Espyo	...right
2016-03-03 20:51:52	@Espyo	will it render the image on the console using colored characters?
2016-03-03 20:51:56	@J	yeah, exactly
2016-03-03 20:52:08	@Espyo	._.
2016-03-03 20:52:11	@Espyo	I mean
2016-03-03 20:52:15	@Espyo	it's not really surprising, it's just
2016-03-03 20:52:17	@J	it does look like this list has got a bit out of hand though, seems to list non-lightweight stuff
2016-03-03 20:52:21	@Espyo	just surprising that there's such a demand for that
2016-03-03 20:53:44	@Espyo	I guess I can always experiment about
2016-03-03 20:53:50	@J	https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1feYNTCWBusHZTOaroFmwP8-1cMoCjX7nKRF4X256zeY/viewanalytics?key=0AnUlFfFTiA3xdEtJeTh4RHFEQXRHdVM1ZUNDbm9xMHc maybe this gives a better idea
2016-03-03 20:53:53	@Espyo	see what applications I like more, and feel faster to me
2016-03-03 20:54:08	@J	since they're actually ranked in a sense, by people who want a lightweight system that's still very usable
2016-03-03 20:54:25	@Espyo	hm, nice
2016-03-03 20:54:37	@Espyo	I actually just want a viable system
2016-03-03 20:54:44	@Espyo	anything that'll give me a comfortable development environment
2016-03-03 20:54:48	@Espyo	that windows CERTAINLY doesn't
2016-03-03 20:54:54	@Espyo	it's just that being lightweight is a great plus
2016-03-03 20:54:58	@J	it's always good to learn about alternatives you never knew about
2016-03-03 20:55:02	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-03 20:57:24	@J	you'll also find that the high-rated programs there have different feature sets than more widely-used equivalents
2016-03-03 20:57:47	@Espyo	right
2016-03-03 20:57:49	@Espyo	which is always good
2016-03-03 20:57:49	@J	for example, the image viewer I use is really simple, just shows an image, but has a shortcut to toggle AA
2016-03-03 20:57:53	@Espyo	but might clash a bit with lightweightness
2016-03-03 20:58:00	@Espyo	oh, neat
2016-03-03 20:58:02	@J	which you're never going to see in the Windows image viewer
2016-03-03 20:58:09	@J	even though it generally has more features
2016-03-03 20:58:15	@Espyo	right
2016-03-03 20:58:28	@Espyo	I'll definitely have to take a closer look at these lists
2016-03-03 20:58:34	@Espyo	probably tomorrow during slow times at work
2016-03-03 20:58:36	@Espyo	thank you so much

2016-03-03 21:24:00	@Espyo	looks like he added something for mobile
2016-03-03 21:24:04	@Espyo	from the looks of it, it's an option on the user settings

2016-03-03 23:53:05	@PikFan	they're hurting themselves
2016-03-03 23:53:15	@PikFan	Zelda's the most hyped game and yet they don't talk about it

2016-03-03 23:53:39	@PikFan	furthermore, don't mention a game and then not talk about it

2016-03-03 23:54:15	@PikFan	lately, it seems like Nintendo's interested in making tons of spin offs and "smaller" games, so to speak
2016-03-03 23:54:30	@PikFan	if that's the case, then they may as well just stop making big games altogether
2016-03-03 23:54:44	@PikFan	because I really don't like the direction Nintendo is going in

2016-03-05 00:09:31	ScruffyChat	PikFan have I told you why I'm uploading all these renders of Pikmin-based karts?
2016-03-05 00:09:37	ScruffyChat	Or, either of you, for that matter
2016-03-05 00:09:47	En_Passant	no
2016-03-05 00:09:48	@PikFan	are you planning on making a Pikmin Kart?
2016-03-05 00:09:58	En_Passant	Didn't someone already do that?
2016-03-05 00:09:58	@PikFan	or something of that effect?
2016-03-05 00:10:06	ScruffyChat	I'm going to make a new video, a faux course intro to Pikmin Kart U
2016-03-05 00:10:11	ScruffyChat	Parodying Mario Kart 8
2016-03-05 00:10:24	ScruffyChat	Yoshi2 already requested the Formidable Oak
2016-03-05 00:10:26	@PikFan	woah
2016-03-05 00:10:28	ScruffyChat	as a track
2016-03-05 00:10:50	@PikFan	so... is this going to be the April Fool's Day joke?
2016-03-05 00:10:51	@PikFan	no jk
2016-03-05 00:10:59	ScruffyChat	I don't think I can do this by April
2016-03-05 00:11:09	@PikFan	yeah
2016-03-05 00:11:14	ScruffyChat	Rendering by itself will take a few days
2016-03-05 00:11:30	ScruffyChat	It's only >15 seconds of content, but at 60 fps
2016-03-05 00:11:44	ScruffyChat	which means somewhere around 900 frames
2016-03-05 00:13:57	ScruffyChat	But it'll have 12 karts, 12 racers, and a few flying shots previewing the course
2016-03-05 00:14:05	ScruffyChat	A la Mario Kart 8
2016-03-05 00:14:16	@PikFan	nice
2016-03-05 00:14:24	ScruffyChat	And I'll compose a kartyish theme to accompany it
2016-03-05 00:14:24	@PikFan	have you played MK8?
2016-03-05 00:14:27	@PikFan	I forget
2016-03-05 00:14:29	ScruffyChat	Yes, I'm a fan
2016-03-05 00:14:34	@PikFan	ah
2016-03-05 00:14:50	ScruffyChat	I don't have the DLC though, although it looks cool and is really 50% more game
2016-03-05 00:14:51	@PikFan	I haven't played MK8 in quite a while
2016-03-05 00:14:56	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-03-05 00:15:32	ScruffyChat	But yeah, shouldn't be too bad
2016-03-05 00:15:49	ScruffyChat	I'd say the most difficult parts will be animating moving things and applying sound effects
2016-03-05 00:16:30	ScruffyChat	I have plenty of concepts, that's the easy part
2016-03-05 00:16:45	@PikFan	right
2016-03-05 00:25:19	En_Passant	Who will be the drivers?
2016-03-05 00:25:27	ScruffyChat	Maybe you guys can help
2016-03-05 00:25:39	ScruffyChat	All the playable leaders will be driver
2016-03-05 00:25:40	ScruffyChat	s
2016-03-05 00:25:50	En_Passant	Halfway there
2016-03-05 00:25:52	ScruffyChat	Which leaves 6 other characters

2016-03-05 00:26:18	@PikFan	and Drake
2016-03-05 00:26:30	En_Passant	He's a kart, though
2016-03-05 00:26:39	En_Passant	Unless you mean Alph's grandpa
2016-03-05 00:26:39	@PikFan	I meant Alph's grandpa
2016-03-05 00:27:15	ScruffyChat	That works!
2016-03-05 00:27:37	ScruffyChat	Thanks guys
2016-03-05 00:27:46	@PikFan	yup
2016-03-05 00:35:14	ScruffyChat	I've meant to ask this now that I think I've figured it out for a good long while
2016-03-05 00:35:24	ScruffyChat	Who's your favorite Nintendo character?
2016-03-05 00:35:50	@PikFan	my favorite?
2016-03-05 00:35:58	@PikFan	uhhhhh
2016-03-05 00:36:39	@PikFan	I can give you my favorite characters from each series, but I don't think Nintendo as a whole...
2016-03-05 00:37:04	ScruffyChat	Fair enough, it is a difficult question what with the different moods and genres
2016-03-05 00:38:59	En_Passant	I have no idea
2016-03-05 00:39:21	En_Passant	Are we talking main characters, enemies, or both?
2016-03-05 00:39:34	ScruffyChat	Main characters
2016-03-05 00:40:12	ScruffyChat	Mine is Bowser
2016-03-05 00:40:28	ScruffyChat	And for me that's talking all of Nintendo
2016-03-05 00:41:04	@PikFan	heh, why?
2016-03-05 00:41:07	-->	UltraYarnYoshi (chatzilla@2601:81:8401:nqms:pvil:owgi:kiqm:tghg) has joined #pikipedia
2016-03-05 00:41:12	ScruffyChat	With enemies it's certainly a different story, but with characters I've decided on Bowser
2016-03-05 00:41:48	ScruffyChat	Because he's just a cool character, to me a lot more interesting than Mario
2016-03-05 00:42:41	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-05 00:42:57	@PikFan	Bowser doesn't really have much... depth, I guess
2016-03-05 00:43:07	@PikFan	unless if you're looking at the RPGs and such
2016-03-05 00:43:31	ScruffyChat	I don't know, I just enjoy seeing Bowser, I always have
2016-03-05 00:43:41	@PikFan	oh, his appearance?
2016-03-05 00:43:48	@PikFan	heh, I suppose so
2016-03-05 00:44:37	ScruffyChat	Really it's his appearance in spinoff Mario games that are the most interesting
2016-03-05 00:45:05	ScruffyChat	When he's not intending to be menacing, seeing this big ox-turtle-dragon thing is kind of hilarious
2016-03-05 00:45:37	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-05 00:45:41	ScruffyChat	But when he is a villain, I think he's a great villain
2016-03-05 00:46:45	ScruffyChat	And growing up with Nintendo games he's earned respect from me, even though his motives are ridiculous at best and one could say his brand of evil is pretty generic
2016-03-05 00:47:41	ScruffyChat	Plus I just found his model from Super Mario 3D world the other day and it's SO much fun
2016-03-05 00:48:34	@PikFan	mm
2016-03-05 00:48:47	@PikFan	ah, neat
2016-03-05 00:48:54	ScruffyChat	Now En_Passant raised a good point; he's not my favorite enemy in Nintendo
2016-03-05 00:49:12	ScruffyChat	But he's my favorite of Nintendo's sentient characters, those who progress stories
2016-03-05 00:49:26	ScruffyChat	I mean without him there'd be no story to Mario
2016-03-05 00:49:34	ScruffyChat	Just... golf
2016-03-05 00:50:06	ScruffyChat	And maybe Luigi's mansion but that still at least referenced Bowser in its final boss
2016-03-05 00:50:08	@PikFan	hey ScruffyChat, have you played any of the Zelda games?
2016-03-05 00:50:30	ScruffyChat	Heh I'm like Charles Martinet
2016-03-05 00:50:44	ScruffyChat	Mario games came first, I've only sort of begun with Zelda
2016-03-05 00:50:59	@PikFan	sort...of?
2016-03-05 00:51:24	ScruffyChat	I've played Twilight Princess, some of Wind Waker, and Ocarina of Time
2016-03-05 00:51:29	@PikFan	ah
2016-03-05 00:51:41	@PikFan	speaking of, they just released TPHD today
2016-03-05 00:51:49	ScruffyChat	I heard about that
2016-03-05 00:51:49	@PikFan	though... it doesn't really look HD to me
2016-03-05 00:51:53	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-05 00:52:03	ScruffyChat	It's difficult to remaster a game
2016-03-05 00:52:31	ScruffyChat	And to me difficult to find a point to remastering a game that would entice a large demographic to buy it again when they could still get the original
2016-03-05 00:52:40	@PikFan	now THIS looks HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSDVY6Q9pfk
2016-03-05 00:52:45	@PikFan	and it was made by a FAN
2016-03-05 00:53:05	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-03-05 00:53:17	ScruffyChat	Bump mapping man... it's the future
2016-03-05 00:53:23	ScruffyChat	Or, well, normal and displacement mapping are
2016-03-05 00:53:35	ScruffyChat	But Pikmin 3 at least had normals
2016-03-05 00:53:54	ScruffyChat	And hopefully Pikmin 4 will have some gosh-darn anti-aliasing
2016-03-05 00:54:28	ScruffyChat	It still bugs me when I play it
2016-03-05 00:55:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, bump mapping really sets the flat game apart from the HD looking game
2016-03-05 00:56:19	ScruffyChat	No surface is perfectly smooth
2016-03-05 00:56:22	En_Passant	Is the Wii U powerful enough to handle that?
2016-03-05 00:56:28	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-03-05 00:56:34	ScruffyChat	It could handle normals in Pikmin 3
2016-03-05 00:56:41	En_Passant	Kind of
2016-03-05 00:56:42	ScruffyChat	I think even the Wii could handle normals
2016-03-05 00:56:52	En_Passant	It wasn't without lag in places
2016-03-05 00:56:53	ScruffyChat	But Pikmin 3 was a crossover game
2016-03-05 00:57:23	ScruffyChat	But I don't think either can handle displacement yet
2016-03-05 00:57:48	ScruffyChat	bump maps and normal maps are lighting tricks, they have nothing to do with the geometry
2016-03-05 00:58:12	ScruffyChat	Displacement actually changes geometry
2016-03-05 00:59:35	@PikFan	neat
2016-03-05 00:59:51	@PikFan	hey Scruffy, I have a question
2016-03-05 00:59:59	@PikFan	how long have you been working with Blender?
2016-03-05 01:00:03	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-03-05 01:00:11	ScruffyChat	Let me check the first image I made
2016-03-05 01:00:29	@PikFan	I really ought to learn Blender sometime
2016-03-05 01:00:34	@PikFan	I want to expand my computer skills
2016-03-05 01:00:56	@PikFan	so that I'm good in programming languages and other advanced programs
2016-03-05 01:01:15	ScruffyChat	Since the second half of 2014
2016-03-05 01:01:29	ScruffyChat	And all on this laptop
2016-03-05 01:02:26	@PikFan	wow
2016-03-05 01:05:24	@PikFan	I feel like I've asked this before, but was it complicated for you to learn?
2016-03-05 01:06:14	ScruffyChat	It's not complicated to learn, there's just so much to learn that I've barely scraped the surface
2016-03-05 01:06:27	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-03-05 01:06:30	ScruffyChat	Although there's a lot that's designed for a computer more powerful than mine
2016-03-05 01:06:39	@PikFan	even so, you still make really high quality renders
2016-03-05 01:06:43	ScruffyChat	There's a sea of tutorials out there to help
2016-03-05 01:06:45	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-03-05 01:06:55	ScruffyChat	I'm planning to make a new Youtube video soon
2016-03-05 01:06:59	@PikFan	neat
2016-03-05 01:07:11	ScruffyChat	Showing Pikmin 3 models in Blender and some quirks about them
2016-03-05 01:07:19	@PikFan	oh, I watched part of your video of the P2 title screen quirks
2016-03-05 01:07:29	ScruffyChat	And showing how texturing works in Pikmin 3, and how it works in Blender at the same time
2016-03-05 01:07:32	@PikFan	from what I saw, it was pretty interesting
2016-03-05 01:07:36	@PikFan	oh, nice
2016-03-05 01:07:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah! I had no idea it would be so popular
2016-03-05 01:07:59	ScruffyChat	like, I've reached at least 5000 people with this video
2016-03-05 01:09:25	@PikFan	wow
2016-03-05 01:17:58	ScruffyChat	Yeah but if you're ever ready to try Blender, I've been able to teach En_Passant and Neocraftz1553 about it before
2016-03-05 01:18:32	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-05 01:18:45	@PikFan	En_Passant, you've dabbled in it too? nice
2016-03-05 01:22:38	En_Passant	Yeah, a little bit
2016-03-05 01:22:46	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-05 01:23:05	En_Passant	It's easy to pick up on. I'm still a beginner
2016-03-05 01:29:05	ScruffyChat	Oh, gotta go for now
2016-03-05 01:30:07	ScruffyChat	I don't know if I'll be on later today, but if not I'll be on tomorrow
2016-03-05 01:30:18	@PikFan	okay
2016-03-05 01:30:20	@PikFan	bye

2016-03-05 16:42:54	@Espyo	gotta love glitches that solve themselves
2016-03-05 16:43:12	@Espyo	I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to find out the best path the Pikmin should take to carry an object
2016-03-05 16:43:15	@Espyo	and it was working fine
2016-03-05 16:43:24	@Espyo	until at one point they were carrying something using a bit of a dumb detour
2016-03-05 16:43:31	@Espyo	I checked all around and couldn't find why
2016-03-05 16:43:41	@Espyo	so I added a quick "preview best path" tool on the area editor
2016-03-05 16:43:53	@Espyo	and changed some things around while making it
2016-03-05 16:44:03	@Espyo	the tool says the Pikmin should be taking the best path, not the detour path that they were
2016-03-05 16:44:07	@Espyo	I wondered "did it fix itself?"
2016-03-05 16:44:10	@Espyo	I checked in-game
2016-03-05 16:44:12	@Espyo	and yep, it did

2016-03-05 17:52:33	@Espyo	oh yeah, I think I've read about it
2016-03-05 17:52:35	@Espyo	seems like a neat idea
2016-03-05 17:52:56	Neocraftz1553	A TRULY OPEN UNIVERSE Whether a distant mountain or a planet hanging low on the horizon, you can go there. You can fly seamlessly from the surface of a planet to another, and every star in the sky is a sun that you can visit. Where you’ll go and how fast you’ll make your way through this universe is up to you. It’s yours for the taking.

2016-03-05 17:53:16	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-05 17:53:48	Neocraftz1553	friend says it'll probably cost around $60 though
2016-03-05 17:53:49	Testyo	$ 60 = 55.182 € / £ 38.994 
2016-03-05 17:54:31	Neocraftz1553	and the chance of meeting another player is very slim
2016-03-05 17:54:42	Neocraftz1553	I like the idea of it, though

2016-03-05 19:03:29	@Espyo	the wiki's also been suffering some changes, so I've been on top of those too
2016-03-05 19:03:40	UltraMario	was wondering if you had the time to participate in my smash tourney
2016-03-05 19:03:49	@Espyo	really don't
2016-03-05 19:03:53	UltraMario	:
2016-03-05 19:03:54	UltraMario	:(
2016-03-05 19:03:56	@Espyo	I only really play Smash like once a week, and that's with close friends
2016-03-05 19:04:00	UltraMario	sorry ;w;
2016-03-05 19:04:08	@Espyo	have fun, though
2016-03-05 19:04:11	UltraMario	thnx
2016-03-05 19:04:28	UltraMario	i just ask because my tourneys usually dont get much players and i could always use more people :p
2016-03-05 19:04:36	@Espyo	right
2016-03-05 19:04:43	@Espyo	you can probably post on Miiverse to ask
2016-03-05 19:04:47	UltraMario	well
2016-03-05 19:04:50	@Espyo	doesn't it have a question feature or something?
2016-03-05 19:04:55	UltraMario	i dont do it on the actual tournament mode
2016-03-05 19:04:57	UltraMario	yeah it does
2016-03-05 19:05:02	@Espyo	well, you can still ask
2016-03-05 19:05:07	@Espyo	and people who are interested can add you as a friend
2016-03-05 19:05:10	UltraMario	i dont do it in tourney mode since i want to have custom stages :p
2016-03-05 19:05:13	@Espyo	and play on normal settings instead of tourney mode
2016-03-05 19:05:13	UltraMario	yeah that's what i do
2016-03-05 19:05:24	@Espyo	so you can still ask on Miiverse
2016-03-05 19:05:24	UltraMario	do it on with friends
2016-03-05 19:05:32	UltraMario	it's dumb you cant do custom stages on tourney mode :<

2016-03-05 19:05:50	@Espyo	well, custom stages aren't tourney-legal
2016-03-05 19:05:54	@Espyo	so it's more of a custom tourney you're doing
2016-03-05 19:06:05	UltraMario	true but
2016-03-05 19:06:17	UltraMario	you can make anything legal in tourneys besides custom stages on tourney mode
2016-03-05 19:06:22	UltraMario	well
2016-03-05 19:06:28	UltraMario	miiverse stage is exception
2016-03-05 19:06:30	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-05 19:06:35	UltraMario	since that cant be done online at all
2016-03-05 19:06:42	UltraMario	but yeah i do these neat gimmick tourneys
2016-03-05 19:06:47	UltraMario	they're usually centered around a theme
2016-03-05 19:06:58	UltraMario	the themes of my last 2 tourneys were smash 64 and mario
2016-03-05 19:07:06	@Espyo	m
2016-03-05 19:07:08	@Espyo	*hm
2016-03-05 19:07:10	UltraMario	so that means only characters, alts, items, and stages based on that theme :>
2016-03-05 19:07:41	UltraMario	the pattern is typically series based tourney -> smash game based tourney
2016-03-05 19:07:52	UltraMario	so the theme of the next tourney will be melee
2016-03-05 19:08:17	UltraMario	does it sound neat?
2016-03-05 19:08:17	UltraMario	:>
2016-03-05 19:09:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-05 19:09:37	UltraMario	thanks
2016-03-05 19:10:01	UltraMario	i figured i wont do any super srs tourneys since im not exactly a competitive player, so i'd do neat theme tourneys instead
2016-03-05 19:10:07	UltraMario	wanna know the theme of the current tourney?
2016-03-05 19:10:28	@Espyo	sure
2016-03-05 19:11:04	Klemen702	Espyo
2016-03-05 19:11:11	Klemen702	you said you are still working on the engine?
2016-03-05 19:11:12	@Espyo	yeah?
2016-03-05 19:11:15	@Espyo	well, yeah
2016-03-05 19:11:19	@Espyo	I'm always working on the engine
2016-03-05 19:11:48	UltraMario	the theme of this one is fire emblem
2016-03-05 19:11:56	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-05 19:11:58	UltraMario	i decided to do fe this time for two reasons:
2016-03-05 19:11:59	Klemen702	wait
2016-03-05 19:12:01	UltraMario	well, three
2016-03-05 19:12:09	Klemen702	when's the last time you released a version?
2016-03-05 19:12:22	Klemen702	just wondering 
2016-03-05 19:12:26	UltraMario	ive decided how ill pick series tourneys from now on is ill do whatever's the most represented in number of characters in smash
2016-03-05 19:12:35	@Espyo	I think it was on christmas
2016-03-05 19:12:38	UltraMario	since pokemon and fe have the same number of characters in smash, i made a poll
2016-03-05 19:12:41	UltraMario	fe won
2016-03-05 19:12:42	@Espyo	next version should be coming up within a week
2016-03-05 19:12:47	@Espyo	I'm actually closer to a new version than I thought I was
2016-03-05 19:12:54	@Espyo	UltraMario: makes sense
2016-03-05 19:13:01	UltraMario	i also figured it'd be neat to coincide with the release date of fire emblem fates
2016-03-05 19:13:07	UltraMario	so it started on feb 19th :>
2016-03-05 19:13:27	UltraMario	i like to do neat things with the start and end dates to match the theme
2016-03-05 19:13:52	UltraMario	like for example
2016-03-05 19:14:00	UltraMario	mario tourney ended on september 13th
2016-03-05 19:14:05	UltraMario	the release date of smb1 in japan
2016-03-05 19:14:10	UltraMario	to celebrate the 30th anniversary
2016-03-05 19:14:26	UltraMario	:>
2016-03-05 19:15:07	UltraMario	let me try to remember the dates i picked for the smash 64 tourney
2016-03-05 19:16:19	UltraMario	well
2016-03-05 19:18:23	UltraMario	it started on december 20th, which is the pal release date, and the end date was january 21st, the japanese release date
2016-03-05 19:18:24	Testyo	21 st = 133.356 kg / 294 lb / 4704 oz
2016-03-05 19:18:47	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-05 19:19:04	UltraMario	i like to do neat things like that :>
2016-03-05 19:19:09	UltraMario	so i can tie in with my theme
2016-03-05 19:19:09	UltraMario	more
2016-03-05 19:24:34	En_Passant	st = short ton?
2016-03-05 19:24:38	UltraMario	anyway
2016-03-05 19:24:48	UltraMario	the fe tourney dates also coincide
2016-03-05 19:24:49	Klemen702	wait
2016-03-05 19:24:53	Klemen702	so what's the version now?
2016-03-05 19:24:58	Klemen702	(lol i should check here more)
2016-03-05 19:25:29	UltraMario	the start date was febuary 19th, which is the NA release date of Fates, and the end date is going to be april 20th, the release date of the first fe in japan
2016-03-05 19:25:44	UltraMario	hi Klemen702, how ya doin?
2016-03-05 19:25:50	UltraMario	:o
2016-03-05 19:26:43	Testyo	Yoshi2 got it right! The number was 83. It took hi
2016-03-05 19:28:49	@Espyo	En_Passant: stone
2016-03-05 19:28:54	@Espyo	the UK measures stuff in stones

2016-03-05 19:29:19	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-05 19:30:09	En_Passant	I think it's SI, Standard International
2016-03-05 19:30:23	Klemen702	hi ultra. i'm good
2016-03-05 19:30:25	@Espyo	right, that's what made me think I was wrong
2016-03-05 19:30:30	@Espyo	"International Standard" is what makes sense
2016-03-05 19:30:37	Klemen702	ah yes
2016-03-05 19:30:39	@Espyo	"Standard Internacional" would be the Portuguese version
2016-03-05 19:30:45	@Espyo	that's why I thought I was wrong
2016-03-05 19:30:45	Klemen702	da superior metric mate
2016-03-05 19:32:09	UltraMario	Klemen702 do you have smash 4?

2016-03-05 19:40:19	UltraMario	but
2016-03-05 19:40:23	UltraMario	it's not my favorite 3d mario
2016-03-05 19:40:24	UltraMario	:p
2016-03-05 19:40:32	UltraMario	it had its share of problems
2016-03-05 19:40:54	Klemen702	but
2016-03-05 19:41:02	Klemen702	64 is atleast the worst?
2016-03-05 19:41:03	Klemen702	right?
2016-03-05 19:42:12	UltraMario	...
2016-03-05 19:42:13	UltraMario	wow

2016-03-05 19:42:23	UltraMario	64 is gr8
2016-03-05 19:42:28	UltraMario	>:|
2016-03-05 19:42:34	Klemen702	althrough i haven't played it becuz i only have gamecube
2016-03-05 19:42:40	UltraMario	oh
2016-03-05 19:42:41	Klemen702	but i can still tell galaxy is better
2016-03-05 19:42:45	UltraMario	well dont judge a game before you play
2016-03-05 19:42:48	UltraMario	:p
2016-03-05 19:42:52	Klemen702	screw taht
2016-03-05 19:42:55	UltraMario	but yeah galaxy and galaxy 2 are my favorites
2016-03-05 19:43:03	Klemen702	althrough
2016-03-05 19:43:06	Klemen702	on a more serious note
2016-03-05 19:43:09	UltraMario	?
2016-03-05 19:43:14	Klemen702	that is also why i don't trust reviews of games
2016-03-05 19:43:24	Klemen702	getting words won't give you an expirience
2016-03-05 19:43:28	UltraMario	depends on the reviwer
2016-03-05 19:43:33	UltraMario	i mean yeah that's true
2016-03-05 19:43:39	Klemen702	so u can't really tell
2016-03-05 19:43:43	UltraMario	experiences vary from person to person
2016-03-05 19:43:43	UltraMario	but
2016-03-05 19:43:44	Yoshi2	sm64 has dated mario physics
2016-03-05 19:43:52	Klemen702	watching vids probs isn't good either but better than reading reviews
2016-03-05 19:43:54	UltraMario	it was revolutionary though
2016-03-05 19:44:02	UltraMario	it set the standard for 3d platformers
2016-03-05 19:44:37	Klemen702	not responding to that because idk what i could even say
2016-03-05 19:44:48	UltraMario	because youve never played it?
2016-03-05 19:44:48	UltraMario	:P
2016-03-05 19:45:27	Yoshi2	UltraMario: revolutionary is gr8, but it is dated now
2016-03-05 19:45:41	UltraMario	not completely
2016-03-05 19:45:50	UltraMario	the camera controls are kinda dated, i'll give you that
2016-03-05 19:46:01	UltraMario	but it was like one of the first 3d platformers ever
2016-03-05 19:46:01	Klemen702	actually
2016-03-05 19:46:03	UltraMario	so i can forgive it
2016-03-05 19:46:05	Klemen702	i have a question
2016-03-05 19:46:06	Yoshi2	and I'm not going to say sm64 is still the best game ever made because tbh there are better ones
2016-03-05 19:46:07	UltraMario	?
2016-03-05 19:46:17	UltraMario	yeah i acknowledge there are better games
2016-03-05 19:46:21	Klemen702	you can forgive it for it being one of the first
2016-03-05 19:46:23	Klemen702	but
2016-03-05 19:46:27	UltraMario	yes?
2016-03-05 19:46:40	Klemen702	would the game being revolutionary for other games be a point to judge it based on it's gameplay?
2016-03-05 19:46:45	UltraMario	well
2016-03-05 19:46:48	UltraMario	idk im just saying
2016-03-05 19:46:59	Klemen702	actually
2016-03-05 19:47:01	UltraMario	if it werent for mario 64 things wouldnt be the same :p
2016-03-05 19:47:07	UltraMario	it set the bar for 3d platformers
2016-03-05 19:47:07	Klemen702	i don't think we know where we are going with this anymore xP
2016-03-05 19:47:11	Yoshi2	jurassic park trespasser was revolutionary as hell
2016-03-05 19:47:13	UltraMario	rpobably

2016-03-05 19:48:10	Klemen702	it revolutionized the fact that people don't know shit xP
2016-03-05 19:48:12	Klemen702	including me
2016-03-05 19:48:36	Yoshi2	UltraMario: you haven't heard of a lot of stuff

2016-03-05 19:59:05	Klemen702	the chat mods have zero humour

2016-03-05 19:59:40	UltraMario	what wikia

2016-03-05 20:21:23	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-03-05 20:21:47	@PikFan	I wish there was a way to have multiple save files on Splatoon, for two reasons:
2016-03-05 20:22:10	@PikFan	1. when my friends come over, so they don't face the wrath of the level 50 players
2016-03-05 20:22:29	@PikFan	2. so that I can start anew and unleash /my/ wrath on the new useres

2016-03-05 21:37:52	Klemen702	what is Börk
2016-03-05 21:50:47	Pidgeotto	a thing that people associate Scandinavians with but isn't endemic to the region at all and is not even used here
2016-03-05 21:50:59	Pidgeotto	a bad meme
2016-03-05 21:51:05	Pidgeotto	a bad untrue stereotype
2016-03-05 21:51:23	Klemen702	it's bad?!?!?1

2016-03-05 21:51:38	Klemen702	anyways
2016-03-05 21:51:41	Klemen702	it's a bad meme?
2016-03-05 21:52:03	Pidgeotto	yes
2016-03-05 21:52:09	Pidgeotto	because it's not something we ever say
2016-03-05 21:52:40	Klemen702	i am heartbroken over this
2016-03-05 21:52:51	Yoshi2	obviously it's something you say, because why would polandball comics ever lie????
2016-03-05 21:53:23	Klemen702	yesssss
2016-03-05 21:53:54	Klemen702	they are 100% true
2016-03-05 21:53:57	Klemen702	yoshi's got a point
2016-03-05 21:57:02	Klemen702	speaking of those comics
2016-03-05 21:57:10	Pidgeotto	god they're so bad
2016-03-05 21:57:22	Klemen702	i tried drawing those balls as a test
2016-03-05 21:57:38	Klemen702	but i'm not sure how i should draw the eyes so i could make it look like they are looking in a specific direction
2016-03-05 21:57:41	Klemen702	http://pasteboard.co/231tIAjY.png
2016-03-05 21:58:31	Klemen702	creativity is such a hard thing to do
2016-03-05 21:58:37	Klemen702	for me
2016-03-05 22:00:30	Yoshi2	polandball comics are great, because you get to do all of the politics memes while having none of the drawing skills
2016-03-05 22:01:05	Klemen702	yes
2016-03-05 22:01:08	Klemen702	literally that
2016-03-05 22:02:10	Klemen702	i tried searching for examples of ''eyes looking up'' but coudn't find any good one to use inspiration from :/

2016-03-05 22:07:39	Yoshi2	they are balls, so you could look at how the eyes/circles change when they move positions on a ball
2016-03-05 22:07:50	Yoshi2	a little bit
2016-03-05 22:08:34	Klemen702	hmm

2016-03-05 22:10:33	Yoshi2	though it seems when the balls look far up, they usually change their body rotation too

2016-03-05 22:25:30	Pidgeotto	the thing about polandball is
2016-03-05 22:25:33	Pidgeotto	don't overdo it
2016-03-05 22:25:44	Pidgeotto	if you overdo it, it ceases to be polandball
2016-03-05 22:25:53	Pidgeotto	it's not supposed to be epic
2016-03-05 22:26:24	Pidgeotto	do you want to know the real reason Israel is a cube

2016-03-05 22:27:35	Pidgeotto	it's because on Krautchan, the place where polandball originates from, the Israel flag that accompanies all Israeli posts on Krautchan's /int/ were glitching up and did not appear circular despite other flags appearing circularly
2016-03-05 22:27:55	Pidgeotto	this is also the reason Kazakhstan is a cube 
2016-03-05 22:28:10	Pidgeotto	because of an imageboard where people were nationalistic about polandballs
2016-03-05 22:28:25	Pidgeotto	themoreyouknow
2016-03-05 22:29:51	Klemen702	question
2016-03-05 22:29:55	Klemen702	how do you ''overdo'' it
2016-03-05 22:30:06	Pidgeotto	go to /r/polandball
2016-03-05 22:30:06	Klemen702	also
2016-03-05 22:30:17	Pidgeotto	and check the most upvoted one
2016-03-05 22:30:18	Klemen702	kazghanistan is a ''brick''
2016-03-05 22:30:32	Pidgeotto	let's do that now
2016-03-05 22:30:57	Pidgeotto	http://i.imgur.com/0tgdLHw.png even this is overdoing it
2016-03-05 22:31:18	Klemen702	i still do not get how you overdo it
2016-03-05 22:31:57	Klemen702	or what's the problem with this
2016-03-05 22:37:14	Pidgeotto	it's supposed to be a thing you do in 5 minutes in mspaint
2016-03-05 22:37:15	Pidgeotto	http://i.imgur.com/YytvMnz.png this is a good one
2016-03-05 22:38:31	Klemen702	so uh
2016-03-05 22:38:35	Klemen702	let me get this straight
2016-03-05 22:38:42	Klemen702	the reason some of the comics are bad
2016-03-05 22:38:47	Klemen702	is because they are done with care?
2016-03-05 22:38:50	Klemen702	on the art
2016-03-05 22:39:02	Klemen702	the pic i showed earlier that i made is actually in MS paint
2016-03-05 22:39:13	Klemen702	just put more detail to it
2016-03-05 22:39:57	Pidgeotto	yes
2016-03-05 22:40:24	Klemen702	i'm not sure how to feel about this
2016-03-05 22:40:25	Pidgeotto	put some effort into it but not too much
2016-03-05 22:40:38	Pidgeotto	this is the 4chan way of thinking of polandballs
2016-03-05 22:40:50	Klemen702	i defenetly will not make much shading
2016-03-05 22:40:53	Pidgeotto	the reddit way of thinking about it is to put a lot of care into thigns
2016-03-05 22:40:57	Klemen702	just 1 color for each part of the flag
2016-03-05 22:41:35	Klemen702	it seems that alot of people seem to be perfectionistic with this tho...
2016-03-05 22:43:52	Klemen702	1 more question
2016-03-05 22:44:10	Klemen702	isn't the main point of these comics the ''story''
2016-03-05 22:46:14	Pidgeotto	the story is what happened irl
2016-03-05 22:46:40	Pidgeotto	my favourite ones are the ones where it's a retelling of an event
2016-03-05 22:46:48	Pidgeotto	but made humorous
2016-03-05 22:47:42	Klemen702	eh
2016-03-05 22:47:46	Klemen702	i find most of them good
2016-03-05 22:48:08	Klemen702	but those are fine too
2016-03-05 22:49:53	Pidgeotto	idk just make a thing

2016-03-06 00:58:30	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-06 00:59:34	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, I finished a render of it last night, he sorta liked it
2016-03-06 01:00:03	Neocraftz1553	The Cabin had to be almost fully covered, thats all
2016-03-06 01:00:12	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-06 01:00:22	@PikFan	wait, I just said "I see" twice
2016-03-06 01:00:23	@PikFan	ugh
2016-03-06 01:00:29	Neocraftz1553	I wasn't too satisfied, so I am reworking the lighting for the render

2016-03-06 01:07:11	@PikFan	right
2016-03-06 01:07:14	Neocraftz15532	because the model I am using now is for rendering, Soooo
2016-03-06 01:07:34	Neocraftz15532	I have to make one where the player actually "plays" on
2016-03-06 01:13:05	Neocraftz15532	another sleepless night for me :|
2016-03-06 01:13:17	@PikFan	at least it's the weekend
2016-03-06 01:13:23	Neocraftz15532	WOW
2016-03-06 01:13:27	@PikFan	sleepless nights on school nights are awful
2016-03-06 01:13:33	Neocraftz15532	yeah, true
2016-03-06 01:13:54	Neocraftz15532	had one last Sunday...
2016-03-06 01:14:23	Neocraftz15532	but WOW
2016-03-06 01:14:28	Neocraftz15532	 The fi-I mean red, sheargrubs jaws seem to glow
2016-03-06 01:14:30	Neocraftz15532	inside
2016-03-06 01:14:39	Neocraftz15532	it looks cool
2016-03-06 01:14:52	@PikFan	nice
2016-03-06 01:15:03	@PikFan	the recolored sheargrub?
2016-03-06 01:15:16	Neocraftz15532	heh, one of them
2016-03-06 01:15:24	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-06 01:15:25	Neocraftz15532	the red one
2016-03-06 01:15:49	Neocraftz15532	Tommarrow, I'll post the render up
2016-03-06 01:16:12	Neocraftz15532	It has lots of fireflies currently, I need to get rid of them
2016-03-06 01:16:37	@PikFan	fireflies?
2016-03-06 01:16:46	@PikFan	why does it have fireflies?
2016-03-06 01:17:01	Neocraftz15532	They snuck into the computers hard drive
2016-03-06 01:17:06	Neocraftz15532	just kidding
2016-03-06 01:17:34	Neocraftz15532	fireflies are renderers worst enemy most of the time
2016-03-06 01:17:56	@PikFan	I didn't know that
2016-03-06 01:18:27	Neocraftz15532	They are extremely bright pixels, that usually show up when lighting is used incorrectly, or a lamps isn't big enough
2016-03-06 01:18:47	@PikFan	mm
2016-03-06 01:19:10	Neocraftz15532	but I do not have incorrect light AND the HDRI is usually "big" enough
2016-03-06 01:19:28	Neocraftz15532	they are also attracted to glossy shaders so that must be it
2016-03-06 01:20:06	@PikFan	is it difficult to remove fireflies?
2016-03-06 01:20:15	Neocraftz15532	Sometimes l, yes
2016-03-06 01:20:26	Neocraftz15532	like the Pyroplasmic Slooch render
2016-03-06 01:20:53	Neocraftz15532	It had sooo many fireflies on its tongue 
2016-03-06 01:21:06	Neocraftz15532	I spent a whole Sunday night trying to remove them
2016-03-06 01:21:27	@PikFan	wow
2016-03-06 01:21:35	Neocraftz15532	You need to set the Clamp values to 1, ans Filter Glossy to 1
2016-03-06 01:21:43	Neocraftz15532	simple, right?
2016-03-06 01:22:04	Neocraftz15532	but those values can and will make your renders crash at times
2016-03-06 01:22:23	@PikFan	that sucks
2016-03-06 01:22:34	Neocraftz15532	so I had to sacrifice a lot of quality
2016-03-06 01:23:02	Neocraftz15532	until I just joined all of the "player" objects into one
2016-03-06 01:23:20	Neocraftz15532	and just used a single value for them and boom, finished
2016-03-06 01:23:53	Neocraftz15532	it even made the Pyroplasmic Slooch renders faster, only taking 3 hours
2016-03-06 01:24:10	@PikFan	has Scruffy been helping you?
2016-03-06 01:24:15	Neocraftz15532	thats how I spent my school morning, rendering something
2016-03-06 01:24:27	Neocraftz15532	yeah
2016-03-06 01:25:00	Neocraftz15532	have you seen his newest renders?
2016-03-06 01:25:11	@PikFan	the karts? yeah
2016-03-06 01:25:16	@PikFan	they're quite impressive
2016-03-06 01:26:54	Neocraftz15532	yeah, I know
2016-03-06 01:27:12	Neocraftz15532	he wants Ideas for 12 characters and 10 other karts
2016-03-06 01:27:35	@PikFan	oh, En Passant and I already gave him ideas for the characters
2016-03-06 01:27:49	Neocraftz15532	says he's going to make animations in blender
2016-03-06 01:27:52	Neocraftz15532	ah, ok
2016-03-06 01:30:47	Neocraftz15532	hey, PikFan
2016-03-06 01:30:52	@PikFan	?
2016-03-06 01:33:23	Neocraftz15532	hope you don't mind, but, can you help invite some people into my render community
2016-03-06 01:33:59	Neocraftz15532	I need some people to give me some feedback on my renders, since Espyo, you and Scruffy aren't always on to judge them
2016-03-06 01:33:59	Neocraftz15532	hey, I thought Espyo goes to sleep by now

2016-03-06 12:49:06	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-03-06 12:49:07	Testyo	sometimes, more rarely, the "Pikmin 3 is out now!" notice
2016-03-06 12:49:23	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-06 12:51:40	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2016-03-06 12:51:40	Testyo	I said sometimes, more rarely, the "Pikmin 3 is out now!" notice because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages anons are still getting the "Pikmin 3 is out now!" notice and sometimes, more rarely, the opposite happens. They were joined by the common word the.
2016-03-06 12:51:50	Yoshi2	yes
2016-03-06 12:52:11	Yoshi2	the pikmin 3 is out now notice is very rare
2016-03-06 12:53:55	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-06 12:54:57	Yoshi2	today I tried to record some bw stuff in dolphin at a higher resolution, considering I need a higher resolution anyway so youtube doesn't mess it up
2016-03-06 12:55:20	@Espyo	how'd it go?
2016-03-06 12:55:39	Yoshi2	for some reason, the video resolution was actually lower when I put the internal resolution to 2x
2016-03-06 12:55:47	Yoshi2	with 1.5x it worked though
2016-03-06 12:56:28	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-03-06 12:56:31	Yoshi2	no idea what dolphin did there
2016-03-06 12:56:33	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2016-03-06 12:56:39	@Espyo	your Dolphin really isn't the friendliest
2016-03-06 12:56:46	Yoshi2	it wasn't even consistent
2016-03-06 12:57:26	Yoshi2	a 10 minute recording session at 2x internal res yielded a 640x480 video
2016-03-06 12:58:06	Yoshi2	a 2 minute recording session at 2x yielded a video with a res that was 1.5 the original res
2016-03-06 12:58:45	Yoshi2	and I forgot what I got with 1.5x internal res, but it was actually higher than expected
2016-03-06 12:59:00	@Espyo	I don't even
2016-03-06 13:02:27	Yoshi2	it's really odd
2016-03-06 13:05:39	Yoshi2	there aren't even many options for framedumping in the program

2016-03-06 14:07:39	@J	why not record in native resolution then scale up afterwards?
2016-03-06 14:13:33	Yoshi2	J: that works, but I'm a bit unhappy with that solution because youtube gives everyone the fake 720p option which doesn't look much better than the original
2016-03-06 14:14:33	@J	does Dolphin upscaling actually increase the quality somehow?
2016-03-06 14:14:43	Yoshi2	yes
2016-03-06 14:14:52	@J	oh, okay
2016-03-06 14:14:53	Yoshi2	dolphin renders the game at a higher resolution
2016-03-06 14:16:14	Yoshi2	which is how you see "mario kart wii at 1080p" or "zelda TP at 1080p" or similar videos on youtube

2016-03-06 17:31:46	Testyo	lots of success, but greater than what it should be
2016-03-06 18:27:30	@J	'Therefore, 1752 would be an unusual year and in fact it was September 1752 that was the unusual month, with 2 September being immediately followed by 14 September.'
2016-03-06 18:27:49	@Espyo	I'm uh... sure that makes sense in context
2016-03-06 18:28:22	@J	apparently that happened in Britain

2016-03-06 18:30:04	@Espyo	never mind
2016-03-06 18:32:05	@J	I wonder if there are any date libraries where creating a date 3/9/1752 gives an error
2016-03-06 18:34:31	@Espyo	didn't the iPhone recently get a brick exploit where users could write a date of a day or two before the Unix epoch?

2016-03-06 21:49:28	@Espyo	I'll think about it tomorrow during work
2016-03-06 21:49:34	@Espyo	I bought the Pikmin 3 DLC today
2016-03-06 21:49:40	@Espyo	so glad to know there's some hefty challenge in here
2016-03-06 21:49:49	@PikFan	you finally bought the DLC?
2016-03-06 21:49:50	@Espyo	I've tried the first stage, Silver Lake Remix, like 10 times now
2016-03-06 21:49:52	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-06 21:50:04	@PikFan	how come you weren't able to get it before? money?
2016-03-06 21:50:12	@Espyo	no reason
2016-03-06 21:50:15	@Espyo	I just never got it
2016-03-06 21:50:18	@PikFan	:
2016-03-06 21:50:19	Yoshi2	it is far too late for me to write documentation, but ooooooooohhh wellllll
2016-03-06 21:50:20	@PikFan	:|
2016-03-06 21:50:22	@Espyo	I'd delay even further
2016-03-06 21:50:29	@Espyo	but I'm meeting up with friends in May
2016-03-06 21:50:35	@Espyo	and we're going to play the DLC stages in co-op mode
2016-03-06 21:50:40	@Espyo	so it'd suck if I went in there blind
2016-03-06 21:50:42	@PikFan	neat
2016-03-06 21:50:52	@Espyo	Yoshi2: it's never to late to write documentation
2016-03-06 21:51:02	@Espyo	but there is a time where it stops being fun to start writing it
2016-03-06 21:51:15	Yoshi2	I also get to do it twice, once in the youtube video and once in the reddit post
2016-03-06 21:51:52	Klemen702	you have friends?

2016-03-06 21:58:48	@Espyo	nope
2016-03-06 21:58:50	@Espyo	the opposite

2016-03-06 23:27:04	@PikFan	the game matches you based on how "good" you are, right? not just level?

2016-03-07 00:01:51	@PikFan	...really?
2016-03-07 00:01:56	@Espyo	Nice! is kinda pointless
2016-03-07 00:02:00	@Espyo	it's neat, but pretty optional
2016-03-07 00:02:10	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-07 00:02:10	@Espyo	and I rarely use To me! since I don't get myself in helpful situations commonly
2016-03-07 00:02:15	@Espyo	I'm usually hiding or trying to be sneaky
2016-03-07 00:02:31	@Espyo	plus, I'm talking on skype
2016-03-07 00:02:32	@PikFan	gah, regional differences
2016-03-07 00:02:37	@Espyo	so anything I need to say, I say it there
2016-03-07 00:02:38	@PikFan	why can't everything be streamlined
2016-03-07 00:02:42	@PikFan	true
2016-03-07 00:02:42	@Espyo	sure, my other teammates don't get it
2016-03-07 00:02:45	@Espyo	but *shrug*
2016-03-07 00:02:53	@Espyo	because Nintendo aren't coordinated
2016-03-07 00:03:02	@PikFan	yeah
2016-03-07 00:03:37	@PikFan	but anyway, sometimes I'll be over in the enemy base and I'll use C'mon! so that I can have reinforcements
2016-03-07 00:03:40	@PikFan	what do they do?
2016-03-07 00:03:42	@PikFan	they ignore me
2016-03-07 00:03:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-07 00:04:01	@Espyo	to be fair, it's a bit hard to notice somebody says something
2016-03-07 00:04:02	@PikFan	they're too distracted FOCUSING ON THE BREAKING THROUGH THE ENEMIES
2016-03-07 00:04:08	@Espyo	but yeah, that's stupid
2016-03-07 00:04:11	@Espyo	and far too common
2016-03-07 00:04:40	@PikFan	I wonder what Splatoon would be like if it had voice chat
2016-03-07 00:04:53	@PikFan	...well, nobody would be able to understand each other
2016-03-07 00:04:59	@PikFan	everybody's speaking a different language
2016-03-07 00:05:12	@PikFan	why does MK8 have regional matchmaking but not Splatoon
2016-03-07 00:05:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-07 00:05:20	@PikFan	that was a poor decision
2016-03-07 00:05:23	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-07 00:05:45	@PikFan	they can't blame their servers and crap
2016-03-07 00:05:56	@PikFan	because there are /plenty/ of American users
2016-03-07 00:06:03	@PikFan	how I know? Splatfest
2016-03-07 00:06:31	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-07 00:07:34	@PikFan	by the way, how do you feel about the new updates?
2016-03-07 00:07:52	@Espyo	I forgot what half of them were
2016-03-07 00:07:55	@Espyo	but they seem good
2016-03-07 00:08:01	@Espyo	could use more balance, though
2016-03-07 00:08:24	@PikFan	balance?
2016-03-07 00:09:32	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-07 00:09:43	@Espyo	most weapons kill too soon
2016-03-07 00:09:47	@Espyo	and rollers, which are meant to do that
2016-03-07 00:09:54	@Espyo	are not killing as often as they should
2016-03-07 00:09:54	@Espyo	bleh
2016-03-07 00:09:57	@Espyo	anyway, bed now

2016-03-08 19:06:04	@Espyo	welp
2016-03-08 19:06:05	Yoshi2	there is probably an up arrow that shows more icons
2016-03-08 19:06:08	@Espyo	check if there's a triang-- yeah
2016-03-08 19:06:12	UltraMario	no
2016-03-08 19:06:25	UltraMario	is there a way to go to sound manager without the icon?
2016-03-08 19:06:36	@Espyo	try control panel
2016-03-08 19:07:20	Yoshi2	yup, it should be in the control panel

2016-03-08 19:07:28	Yoshi2	yay

2016-03-08 19:10:37	UltraMario	:(

2016-03-08 21:18:29	@Espyo	...interesting
2016-03-08 21:18:35	@Espyo	if you use free cam on the Careening Dirigibugs
2016-03-08 21:18:43	@Espyo	and try to look at them from the opposite side of the in-game camera
2016-03-08 21:18:52	@Espyo	that half of the balloons is not rendered
2016-03-08 21:19:47	Yoshi2	sounds like whatever is making it so that things you don't see aren't rendered is working
2016-03-08 21:19:59	Yoshi2	or am I missing something
2016-03-08 21:20:30	@Espyo	don't think that's it, no
2016-03-08 21:20:34	@Espyo	something something occlusion
2016-03-08 21:20:56	@Espyo	I think it's just because since the balloons are transparent, they would probably look like trash if all of it was rendered
2016-03-08 21:21:07	@Espyo	 3D games are actually horrible with transparency
2016-03-08 21:21:10	@Espyo	it's ridiculous
2016-03-08 21:21:23	@Espyo	but it also doesn't make sense, since they could just make the backsides of each polygon invisible
2016-03-08 21:21:28	@Espyo	which they already are for pretty much all models in the game
2016-03-08 21:21:37	@Espyo	...just Pikmin 2 being janky, what else is new *shrug*
2016-03-08 21:21:50	Yoshi2	I heard the water is wet
2016-03-08 21:24:58	@Espyo	ye
2016-03-08 21:25:37	Yoshi2	I recently had a new reply on reddit, checked it and was disappointed that it was just a continuation of when I wanted to help a guy do framedump in dolphin
2016-03-08 21:25:42	Yoshi2	on a mac
2016-03-08 21:26:05	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-08 21:26:22	Klemen702	dolphins on mac?
2016-03-08 21:26:33	Klemen702	is this some new mcdonalds food or what?
2016-03-08 21:27:57	Yoshi2	yup
2016-03-08 21:28:29	Yoshi2	but it's also running dolphin, the gamecube/wii emulator, on a mac computer/a computer running osx
2016-03-08 21:29:16	Klemen702	i'm not sure if the joke flew over your head or you got it but it still flew over your head
2016-03-08 21:30:35	Yoshi2	I got it but it was really lame so I clarified my statement
2016-03-08 21:30:55	Klemen702	i agree that it was lame
2016-03-08 21:31:10	Klemen702	your reward for thinking it's lame is a cringy pic

2016-03-09 01:21:34	@PikFan	how goes your Pikmin Kart project?
2016-03-09 01:22:23	ScruffyChat	Good, I'm in the process of making a Snagret chopper
2016-03-09 01:22:35	@PikFan	ooh
2016-03-09 01:22:39	@PikFan	that sounds neat
2016-03-09 01:22:48	ScruffyChat	And I also got an idea for that piano rendition of the Vehemoth Phosbat's theme you asked fr
2016-03-09 01:22:50	ScruffyChat	for*
2016-03-09 01:23:14	@PikFan	ah, so you're actually going to do it? awesome!
2016-03-09 01:23:20	ScruffyChat	thanks!
2016-03-09 01:23:29	ScruffyChat	It is not an easy tune to pick apart
2016-03-09 01:23:37	ScruffyChat	But it is easy to arrange
2016-03-09 01:23:52	@PikFan	heh, really? (about the not easy tune bit)
2016-03-09 01:24:28	ScruffyChat	yeah, there's just so much going on that not all of it can be played at once on piano
2016-03-09 01:24:38	@PikFan	mm
2016-03-09 01:27:31	ScruffyChat	But I have an arrangement going that's really fun to play so far
2016-03-09 01:27:41	@PikFan	sweet
2016-03-09 01:27:51	@PikFan	I look forward to hearing it
2016-03-09 01:28:11	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-03-09 01:30:04	ScruffyChat	I wanted to qualify how I said the other day that Bowser is my favorite Nintendo character
2016-03-09 01:30:25	@PikFan	qualify?
2016-03-09 01:30:56	ScruffyChat	I prefer Bowser when he has little or nothing to say
2016-03-09 01:31:16	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-09 01:31:45	ScruffyChat	Because you mentioned the Mario RPGs, and I realized that, while all the dialogue he has in those games can be funny, it's redundant to the nature of Bowser, and it's not a successful subversion of his archetype
2016-03-09 01:32:15	ScruffyChat	I like him best as a monster; his appearance in the first Super Mario Galaxy is the best for me
2016-03-09 01:32:28	@PikFan	ah
2016-03-09 01:32:45	@PikFan	but you still like his appearance, then?
2016-03-09 01:32:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, he's well designed
2016-03-09 01:33:18	ScruffyChat	It's not really a big deal though, game to game I'd certainly have other favorites
2016-03-09 01:33:49	@PikFan	I think the incarnation of Ganondorf in The Wind Waker is my favorite villain
2016-03-09 01:33:56	@PikFan	you almost feel sorry for him
2016-03-09 01:33:57	ScruffyChat	That was a good one
2016-03-09 01:33:59	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-09 01:34:47	@PikFan	Zant is also another good one
2016-03-09 01:35:08	@PikFan	he's this analytical, cold, and formidable person
2016-03-09 01:35:16	@PikFan	but he's actually insane
2016-03-09 01:35:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-09 01:35:42	@PikFan	I just really like the characters in the Zelda series
2016-03-09 01:36:14	@PikFan	aah, I wish I could write my essays on video games
2016-03-09 01:36:20	@PikFan	books are okay, just...
2016-03-09 01:36:30	@PikFan	I'd rather write an essay on something I'm more familiar with
2016-03-09 01:36:34	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-09 01:36:43	@PikFan	there are tons of themes in Zelda, I feel
2016-03-09 01:36:56	@PikFan	power is a major one
2016-03-09 01:36:59	@PikFan	as well as good and evil
2016-03-09 01:37:02	ScruffyChat	Whenever I feel like writing a video game essay I just do it
2016-03-09 01:37:03	@PikFan	and friendship
2016-03-09 01:37:17	@PikFan	heh, nice
2016-03-09 01:37:57	@PikFan	what essays have you written for video games?
2016-03-09 01:42:39	ScruffyChat	Well, one on which Bowser is the best, for starters, but also one on how texturing and lighting works, and I started one once on a sort of manifesto for characters being controlled by players
2016-03-09 01:43:09	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-09 01:44:23	ScruffyChat	I mean, I don't want to be a super-nerd, but I just find essays a great means of expression
2016-03-09 01:44:32	ScruffyChat	Even if they're just stream-of-consciousness
2016-03-09 01:44:53	@PikFan	I write good essays, just...
2016-03-09 01:44:58	@PikFan	I have a very
2016-03-09 01:45:02	@PikFan	VERY
2016-03-09 01:45:07	@PikFan	hard time doing so
2016-03-09 01:45:22	@PikFan	I've got bad anxiety when it comes to writing
2016-03-09 01:45:38	@PikFan	I mean, writing for schoolwork and the like
2016-03-09 01:45:54	@PikFan	for fan projects, I don't get that anxiety, although I do procrastinate :P
2016-03-09 01:46:42	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-09 01:47:01	@PikFan	but yeah, for school, I've always had writing anxiety
2016-03-09 01:47:07	@PikFan	grade school was not good
2016-03-09 01:47:27	@PikFan	when I was 4, I taught myself how to /read/
2016-03-09 01:47:33	@PikFan	and I started writing shortly after
2016-03-09 01:47:49	@PikFan	in kindergarten, I wanted to spell words correctly
2016-03-09 01:47:55	@PikFan	kindergarten was alright
2016-03-09 01:48:09	@PikFan	then in first grade, my teacher for whatever reason could not be bothered to help me
2016-03-09 01:48:23	@PikFan	she always told me to "guess'n'go"
2016-03-09 01:48:28	@PikFan	and I hated that
2016-03-09 01:49:03	@PikFan	so that's when my writing anxiety started developing, because my teacher would not help me
2016-03-09 01:49:11	ScruffyChat	Aww man, I'm sorry
2016-03-09 01:49:44	@PikFan	I'm a perfectionist, I always have been, but it manifested itself moreso when I was younger
2016-03-09 01:50:00	@PikFan	but anyway, that was the basis of my writing anxiety
2016-03-09 01:50:21	@PikFan	I had excellent, understanding teachers in second and third grade
2016-03-09 01:50:29	@PikFan	but fourth grade was awful
2016-03-09 01:50:35	ScruffyChat	At least you're aware of the problem
2016-03-09 01:50:38	@PikFan	she didn't understand at all
2016-03-09 01:50:40	ScruffyChat	That's a good step to overcoming it
2016-03-09 01:50:49	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-03-09 01:51:07	@PikFan	but anyway, my teacher would punish me for not doing homework by keeping me in recess
2016-03-09 01:51:12	@PikFan	of course, that made it worse
2016-03-09 01:51:36	@PikFan	and, as you can imagine, it became a positive feedback thing (or should I say negative?)
2016-03-09 01:52:06	@PikFan	so grade school just really left me scarred when it comes to writing
2016-03-09 01:52:57	ScruffyChat	So, scared of the feedback? Or just of the task itself
2016-03-09 01:53:36	@PikFan	by the feedback, I was referring to the anxiety
2016-03-09 01:53:43	@PikFan	it got worse and worse and worse
2016-03-09 01:54:19	@PikFan	I'm not necessarily scared of doing writing as I am stressed about it
2016-03-09 01:54:32	@PikFan	because, again, of the perfectionism
2016-03-09 01:54:55	ScruffyChat	I understand
2016-03-09 01:55:24	@PikFan	I mean, don't get me wrong, I write amazing things
2016-03-09 01:55:31	ScruffyChat	Well as you go on in school and college, the teachers/professors get better at helping with that
2016-03-09 01:55:42	@PikFan	here, read an essay I wrote for the Lord of the Rings last year: http://pastebin.com/yX3ar0he
2016-03-09 01:55:45	@PikFan	brb
2016-03-09 01:59:12	@PikFan	sorry, I gotta go, I'm going to a movie
2016-03-09 01:59:28	@PikFan	I'll probably be back in about 2 hours, if you're still on by then
2016-03-09 01:59:43	@PikFan	bye

2016-03-09 20:08:24	Yoshi2	9 pm is an unusual time for you to come on
2016-03-09 20:09:02	@J	such stalking
2016-03-09 20:09:40	Yoshi2	technically it is 8 pm for you, but you get my point
2016-03-09 20:13:00	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-09 20:13:04	@Espyo	yeah, a bit of a delay
2016-03-09 20:14:28	@Espyo	had a tiny party at work to unveil new office space
2016-03-09 20:14:30	@Espyo	cool stuff
2016-03-09 20:14:42	@Espyo	I didn't really realize this before
2016-03-09 20:14:49	@Espyo	but damn, if a party has free food, you really eat yourself stupid
2016-03-09 20:15:02	@Espyo	I'm not the kind to eat a lot, but I filled myself with chocolate croissants

2016-03-09 21:58:11	Yoshi2	hi neo
2016-03-09 22:00:27	Neocraftz1553	I'm just here waiting for Pikmin 4
2016-03-09 22:00:56	@Espyo	I still need to decide what enemy to add to the next release of the engine
2016-03-09 22:00:59	@Espyo	it needs to be something original
2016-03-09 22:01:02	@Espyo	but I can't come up with anything
2016-03-09 22:01:07	@Espyo	I wanted something to show off the engine's power
2016-03-09 22:01:26	@Espyo	but I've got nothing that hasn't been done before (biting (Bulborbs), flying and one-hit KOs (Spectralids), etc.)
2016-03-09 22:01:37	@Espyo	or the ideas I do have, I don't have the mechanics for them yet
2016-03-09 22:02:00	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-09 22:02:22	Neocraftz1553	An enemy that has appeared in the games?
2016-03-09 22:02:30	@Espyo	I wanted something original this time
2016-03-09 22:02:33	@Espyo	a completely new creation
2016-03-09 22:02:39	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-09 22:02:42	@Espyo	so the players can have something new to play around with and explore and learn
2016-03-09 22:02:48	@Espyo	but if I can't figure anything out, I'll just go with a canon enemy
2016-03-09 22:02:53	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-09 22:03:01	@Espyo	any ideas?
2016-03-09 22:03:10	Neocraftz1553	If you have to go with a canon enemy, try to make sheargrubs
2016-03-09 22:03:16	Neocraftz1553	now, for an origional
2016-03-09 22:03:25	@Espyo	hm, I guess I could make Sheargrubs
2016-03-09 22:03:26	@Espyo	should be simple
2016-03-09 22:03:30	@Espyo	but I can't make them eat bridges just yet
2016-03-09 22:03:32	@Espyo	maybe another time
2016-03-09 22:03:37	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-09 22:03:47	Neocraftz1553	no eating bridges is good
2016-03-09 22:03:57	Neocraftz1553	alright, maybeeeeee
2016-03-09 22:05:21	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-03-09 22:05:47	Neocraftz1553	The Infernal Emporer Bulblax?
2016-03-09 22:06:00	@Espyo	an Emperor Bulblax? that might be too complex
2016-03-09 22:06:08	@Espyo	but why that? what's so special about it?
2016-03-09 22:06:13	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Infernal_Emperor_Bulblax
2016-03-09 22:06:23	Neocraftz1553	eet haz fyre
2016-03-09 22:06:36	Neocraftz1553	nah.. you're right
2016-03-09 22:06:40	@Espyo	nope, sorry, hazards
2016-03-09 22:06:43	@Espyo	not implemented yet
2016-03-09 22:06:53	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-09 22:07:08	Neocraftz1553	Hmm...
2016-03-09 22:07:28	Neocraftz1553	A Skitterleaf that...
2016-03-09 22:07:29	Neocraftz1553	nope hazards
2016-03-09 22:07:34	Neocraftz1553	This is pretty hard
2016-03-09 22:07:39	@Espyo	it really is...
2016-03-09 22:07:42	@Espyo	hazards come next
2016-03-09 22:07:45	@Espyo	so I could make a lot of enemies
2016-03-09 22:07:47	@Espyo	but for now...
2016-03-09 22:07:52	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:08:08	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-09 22:08:48	Neocraftz1553	Wait, will crystal come as a hazard?
2016-03-09 22:08:57	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-09 22:08:58	@Espyo	I guess s
2016-03-09 22:09:00	@Espyo	*o
2016-03-09 22:09:19	Neocraftz1553	yeah, you've got your hands full
2016-03-09 22:09:22	Neocraftz1553	of crystal
2016-03-09 22:09:32	Neocraftz1553	fire, water, and electricity
2016-03-09 22:09:35	Neocraftz1553	plus poison
2016-03-09 22:09:48	Neocraftz1553	 5 hazards
2016-03-09 22:09:52	Neocraftz1553	ok, the enemy
2016-03-09 22:09:58	@Espyo	well, the hazards should be dynamic
2016-03-09 22:09:59	@Espyo	like
2016-03-09 22:10:03	@Espyo	a hazard is just a concept
2016-03-09 22:10:12	@Espyo	and then you can have Pikmin that resist that hazard
2016-03-09 22:10:23	@Espyo	and Pikmin that are the only ones that can hurt enemies with that hazard
2016-03-09 22:10:31	@Espyo	Pikmin that can suffer from that hazard will enter some status effect
2016-03-09 22:10:35	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:10:36	@Espyo	I'll create status effects along with hazards
2016-03-09 22:10:46	@Espyo	status effects could be from catching on fire, to being spicy
2016-03-09 22:10:47	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:10:49	@Espyo	so they too are dynamic
2016-03-09 22:10:53	@Espyo	so I don't need to make specific hazards
2016-03-09 22:10:55	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-09 22:11:05	Neocraftz1553	just status effects
2016-03-09 22:11:05	@Espyo	you can create a Garble Pikmin that is immune to the Garble hazard, that the Garble Bulborb has
2016-03-09 22:11:06	@Espyo	and it just works
2016-03-09 22:11:16	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-09 22:11:18	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:11:34	@Espyo	hm, I'll have to make water on that version as well
2016-03-09 22:11:36	@Espyo	that'll be fun
2016-03-09 22:11:41	@Espyo	still not sure how to do convincing water in a top-down view
2016-03-09 22:12:08	Neocraftz1553	I'm still thinking a second layer would be just fine
2016-03-09 22:12:21	@Espyo	but it should be animated in some way
2016-03-09 22:12:25	@Espyo	that's the part that's really tickling me
2016-03-09 22:12:44	Neocraftz1553	.gif?
2016-03-09 22:12:45	Neocraftz1553	oh, wait
2016-03-09 22:12:55	@Espyo	I could make it animated like the enemies are animated
2016-03-09 22:12:59	@Espyo	but it probably wouldn't work as well
2016-03-09 22:13:01	@Espyo	...maybe?
2016-03-09 22:13:08	@Espyo	but it's a bit of a lazy and kinda static way
2016-03-09 22:13:09	@Espyo	hm, maybe
2016-03-09 22:13:11	Neocraftz1553	that won't work when Pikmin enter water
2016-03-09 22:13:13	@Espyo	maybe maybe maybe...
2016-03-09 22:13:20	@Espyo	it might work
2016-03-09 22:13:23	@Espyo	just won't look very good
2016-03-09 22:13:30	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:13:37	Neocraftz1553	but, better than nothing
2016-03-09 22:13:46	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-09 22:14:08	@Espyo	J: why does GCEdit change the cursor to the "drop stuff here" cursor when you drop a file on the window
2016-03-09 22:14:10	@Espyo	but does nothing?
2016-03-09 22:14:37	@Espyo	also, I just replaced the Awakening Wood Red Bulborb with a Caustic Dweevil
2016-03-09 22:14:41	@Espyo	can't wait for this to go oh so wrong
2016-03-09 22:14:43	@Espyo	or oh so right
2016-03-09 22:14:46	@Espyo	pfft, on Pikmin 2? yeah, right
2016-03-09 22:15:27	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-09 22:15:43	@Espyo	it didn't crash...
2016-03-09 22:15:53	@Espyo	but it didn't replace the enemy either
2016-03-09 22:15:56	Neocraftz1553	What if it gets replaced with a Titan dweevle
2016-03-09 22:16:17	Neocraftz1553	So many spelling mistakes
2016-03-09 22:16:19	@Espyo	the game hates Titan Dweevils outside of the cave it's meant to be on
2016-03-09 22:16:22	@Espyo	lol
2016-03-09 22:16:46	Neocraftz1553	Sorry, I'm typing kinda fast
2016-03-09 22:16:56	@Espyo	damn, I need Scruffy
2016-03-09 22:17:02	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:19:25	Neocraftz1553	Why are you replacing a Bulborb for a Caustic Dweevil?
2016-03-09 22:21:42	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-03-09 22:21:46	Testyo	if you don't know Awesome Games Done Quick, it's a marathon where they have different games? :P
2016-03-09 22:22:31	@Espyo	it is, Testyo
2016-03-09 22:22:32	Testyo	I thought of this because if we add game banner templates to all the articles, some articles might end up with a huge tower of templates at least they maintain minimal styles and such
2016-03-09 22:22:40	@Espyo	and the Caustic Dweevil is the next one on my "no background" project
2016-03-09 22:22:45	@Espyo	[[File:Careening Dirigibug.png]]
2016-03-09 22:22:46	Testyo	"File:Careening_Dirigibug.png" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:Careening_Dirigibug.png
2016-03-09 22:23:03	@Espyo	I want it on the Awakening Wood since the lighting in caves is always blegh
2016-03-09 22:23:45	@Espyo	oh wait, this might be that thing Scruffy said
2016-03-09 22:23:57	@Espyo	where if the enemy's data is on the save data, it'll just use that enemy
2016-03-09 22:24:01	@Espyo	Pikmin is in INSANELY weird
2016-03-09 22:24:02	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-09 22:24:16	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:24:27	@Espyo	*shrug* I'll just replace the Dwarves
2016-03-09 22:24:30	@Espyo	I think those don't get saved
2016-03-09 22:24:54	Neocraftz1553	or do they
2016-03-09 22:25:10	@Espyo	only one way to find out!
2016-03-09 22:25:42	Neocraftz1553	Replacing them with a spider
2016-03-09 22:25:53	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-09 22:26:00	@Espyo	didn't work
2016-03-09 22:26:03	@Espyo	this game doesn't play fair
2016-03-09 22:26:09	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-09 22:26:24	Neocraftz1553	the burrow-nit
2016-03-09 22:26:34	@Espyo	might be the same thing
2016-03-09 22:26:42	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-03-09 22:27:19	Neocraftz1553	Is the Awakening Wood the only area you have access to? 
2016-03-09 22:27:31	@Espyo	not really
2016-03-09 22:27:39	@Espyo	but if it's not working for these two enemies, I don't think it'll work for any...
2016-03-09 22:27:50	@Espyo	I think the game keeps track of these enemies in the save data because it needs to know when they were last killed
2016-03-09 22:27:53	@Espyo	so it knows what day to respawn them on
2016-03-09 22:27:54	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-09 22:27:54	@Espyo	but like
2016-03-09 22:27:59	@Espyo	the Dwarf Bulborbs respawn every day
2016-03-09 22:28:00	@Espyo	so...
2016-03-09 22:28:07	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-03-09 22:28:09	@Espyo	either I'm doing something wrong, or EVERYTHING is saved on the save data
2016-03-09 22:28:25	Neocraftz1553	The pellet posies
2016-03-09 22:28:46	@Espyo	the game keeps track of their growth level
2016-03-09 22:28:49	@Espyo	between days
2016-03-09 22:29:14	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-09 22:29:32	Neocraftz1553	Same for the Spiderworts
2016-03-09 22:29:36	Neocraftz1553	right?
2016-03-09 22:29:57	@Espyo	I bet
2016-03-09 22:30:40	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-09 22:30:42	Neocraftz1553	hmmmmmmm
2016-03-09 22:31:45	@Espyo	fine, I'll just place the enemies I want on sublevel one of Hole of Heroes
2016-03-09 22:31:50	@Espyo	it's the closest cave to anywhere in the game
2016-03-09 22:31:58	Neocraftz1553	heh, ok
2016-03-09 22:31:59	@Espyo	and is on the "metal" theme, which has good lighting
2016-03-09 22:32:07	@Espyo	uh, I meant the closest cave to any landing site in the game
2016-03-09 22:32:08	@Espyo	durr
2016-03-09 22:32:29	Neocraftz1553	I  dontknow
2016-03-09 22:33:22	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-03-09 22:36:40	Neocraftz1553	just go with the sheargrubd
2016-03-09 22:37:43	@Espyo	I guess I will...
2016-03-09 22:37:51	@Espyo	I'll add custom enemies when hazards come
2016-03-09 22:37:59	@Espyo	plus, I want to release this before I get a new laptop
2016-03-09 22:38:04	@Espyo	which should happen in like a week
2016-03-09 22:38:09	@Espyo	so I should try to do a simple enemy
2016-03-09 22:40:22	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-09 22:40:49	Neocraftz1553	sorry, custom enemies usually have hazards on them
2016-03-09 22:40:57	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-09 22:40:59	Neocraftz1553	unless they are just recolored
2016-03-09 22:41:09	Neocraftz1553	like some of my enemies :b
2016-03-09 22:42:13	Neocraftz1553	I might try makimg an emperer bulblax in the engne
2016-03-09 22:42:26	Neocraftz1553	but not with a good texture...
2016-03-09 22:42:40	@Espyo	it'll be hard
2016-03-09 22:42:58	Neocraftz1553	I'm not a good drawer
2016-03-09 22:43:59	Neocraftz1553	I'll try
2016-03-09 22:44:12	Neocraftz1553	It might just start with simple animtions
2016-03-09 22:44:17	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-09 22:44:24	Neocraftz1553	been nice chatting. but I gotra go
2016-03-09 22:44:29	@Espyo	all right
2016-03-09 22:44:30	@Espyo	see ya
2016-03-09 22:49:25	<--	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@jy-16-036-519-69.public.wayport.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-03-09 23:11:42	-->	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@207.98.otz.su) has joined #pikipedia
2016-03-09 23:11:48	ScruffyChat	Hi everyone!
2016-03-09 23:11:57	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-09 23:12:06	@Espyo	oh, I needed your help earlier, but I've got it sorted now
2016-03-09 23:12:18	ScruffyChat	Oh! What with?
2016-03-09 23:12:27	@Espyo	I'm trying to take screenshots of enemies in high quality so I can crop the backgrounds and have nice, crisp images for the main article
2016-03-09 23:12:37	@Espyo	as opposed to the crappy low-resolution artwork we have currently
2016-03-09 23:12:42	ScruffyChat	Ah I see
2016-03-09 23:12:45	@Espyo	like this: [[Caustic Dweevil]]
2016-03-09 23:12:46	Testyo	"Caustic_Dweevil" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Caustic_Dweevil
2016-03-09 23:12:46	@Espyo	blech
2016-03-09 23:12:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-09 23:12:55	@Espyo	anyway, Caustic Dweevils are only found in caves
2016-03-09 23:12:59	@Espyo	which have crappy lighting
2016-03-09 23:13:05	@Espyo	plus, it takes forever to navigate a cave
2016-03-09 23:13:13	@Espyo	so I thought I'd replace the Bulborb at the Awakening Wood with one
2016-03-09 23:13:15	@Espyo	it didn't work
2016-03-09 23:13:24	ScruffyChat	AH
2016-03-09 23:13:28	ScruffyChat	Ah*
2016-03-09 23:13:35	@Espyo	then I realized it's probably because of that thing you said where if an enemy's is saved on the memory card, it won't work
2016-03-09 23:13:40	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-03-09 23:13:45	@Espyo	I just settled with placing the enemy on Hole of Heroes 1
2016-03-09 23:13:48	@Espyo	super easy to reach, and has good lighting 
2016-03-09 23:13:51	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-03-09 23:13:53	@Espyo	since it's an open "metal" sublevel
2016-03-09 23:13:54	ScruffyChat	Nice!
2016-03-09 23:13:56	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-03-09 23:13:56	@Espyo	but that got me thinking
2016-03-09 23:14:04	@Espyo	what enemies DON'T get saved on the memory card?
2016-03-09 23:14:23	@Espyo	I figured the Red Bulborb makes sense, since the game keeps track of the day it last died on so it knows when to respawn
2016-03-09 23:14:31	@Espyo	but I tried replacing the Dwarf Bulborbs and that didn't work either
2016-03-09 23:14:33	ScruffyChat	Well, the thing is, enemies that appear on "initgen" will be there since day 1
2016-03-09 23:14:46	ScruffyChat	Which confusingly is referred to as "0"
2016-03-09 23:14:59	ScruffyChat	But all other files will not be saved to the memory card until the day they begin
2016-03-09 23:15:20	ScruffyChat	So you can change a spawn file that happens on day 6 as much as you want, until day 6
2016-03-09 23:15:30	ScruffyChat	And then it's stuck like that
2016-03-09 23:15:39	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-03-09 23:15:45	ScruffyChat	But also, most of the files are something like "0-9" or "10-19"
2016-03-09 23:15:50	ScruffyChat	They're temporary
2016-03-09 23:16:14	ScruffyChat	So you see some enemies duplicated in those files so that they never disappear from the area
2016-03-09 23:16:43	@Espyo	I'm not quite sure I understand
2016-03-09 23:16:46	ScruffyChat	Like the Red Bulborb in the Valley of Repose; because it doesn't show up on day 1, it has to show up in all the other non-looping files in order to not disappear
2016-03-09 23:17:00	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-03-09 23:17:04	@Espyo	I get you now
2016-03-09 23:17:13	@Espyo	hm... the fact that the non-loop files exist makes me think
2016-03-09 23:17:22	@Espyo	are there any enemies that only appear on specific days, and then never again?
2016-03-09 23:17:27	ScruffyChat	Hmmm
2016-03-09 23:17:29	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2016-03-09 23:17:30	@Espyo	I mean, there has to be, that's why the files are there
2016-03-09 23:17:34	ScruffyChat	I'll have to look through that
2016-03-09 23:17:40	@Espyo	I think that on the Perplexing Pool, one enemy is removed after a certain day
2016-03-09 23:17:45	@Espyo	[[Perplexing Pool]] we might have it here
2016-03-09 23:17:45	Testyo	"Perplexing_Pool" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Perplexing_Pool
2016-03-09 23:18:07	@Espyo	>Shearwig × 11 (3 of them replace a Yellow Wollywog on day 10)
2016-03-09 23:18:16	@Espyo	one of these days, I'm going to dump the info from the game's files using some script
2016-03-09 23:18:19	@Espyo	quick and flawless
2016-03-09 23:18:23	@Espyo	and just use that on the wiki
2016-03-09 23:19:27	ScruffyChat	WOAH what the heck?
2016-03-09 23:19:41	ScruffyChat	I just looked in "yakushima" to see if any enemies disappear
2016-03-09 23:20:03	ScruffyChat	And on the file "0-1" (only days 1-2) there's a CAVE that shows up
2016-03-09 23:20:11	@Espyo	whaaa?
2016-03-09 23:20:24	@Espyo	what's its ID?!
2016-03-09 23:20:31	@Espyo	if... you can know that
2016-03-09 23:20:33	ScruffyChat	Google Translate says this is "Challenge cave experiment
2016-03-09 23:20:52	ScruffyChat	placed at -75, 80, 800
2016-03-09 23:20:57	ScruffyChat	I need to find where that is
2016-03-09 23:20:59	@Espyo	there has to be some code to control what day it is
2016-03-09 23:21:07	@Espyo	wait, I have the script
2016-03-09 23:21:08	@Espyo	I can just run that
2016-03-09 23:21:16	@Espyo	oh, but I'll need a reference point..
2016-03-09 23:21:17	@Espyo	*...
2016-03-09 23:21:21	@Espyo	by script, I mean the plotter thing
2016-03-09 23:21:25	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-03-09 23:21:29	@Espyo	where are the other caves?
2016-03-09 23:21:33	@Espyo	like, what file?
2016-03-09 23:21:39	@Espyo	if I can plot them, I'll know exactly where to place them
2016-03-09 23:21:45	@Espyo	and then I'll have a reference
2016-03-09 23:21:55	@Espyo	though tbh, chances are that cave is placed on top of one of the normal caves
2016-03-09 23:22:29	ScruffyChat	one is at -1455.000000 1.620000 -305.000000
2016-03-09 23:22:52	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-09 23:22:53	ScruffyChat	None of the normal caves are at that location
2016-03-09 23:23:10	ScruffyChat	second is at -900.000000 -37.490002 -2540.000000
2016-03-09 23:23:15	@Espyo	oh, Dolphin has a day code pre-packaged for the US version
2016-03-09 23:23:22	@Espyo	I'll boot it up and force it to be day 1
2016-03-09 23:23:33	ScruffyChat	Hm, interesting
2016-03-09 23:24:13	@Espyo	whaaa!
2016-03-09 23:24:20	@Espyo	me having the code on made the game think the save file is corrupted
2016-03-09 23:24:27	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-03-09 23:24:36	@Espyo	let's... try that again
2016-03-09 23:24:48	ScruffyChat	Alternatively I could start a new game and put the Geographic Projection in the Valley of Repose
2016-03-09 23:25:00	ScruffyChat	It might break the game, but it should unlock Perplexing Pool on day 2
2016-03-09 23:25:10	@Espyo	didn't you say that cave's only there on day 1?
2016-03-09 23:25:31	ScruffyChat	Oh shoot, yeah
2016-03-09 23:25:35	ScruffyChat	0-1 means only 1
2016-03-09 23:25:54	@Espyo	...stupid code is a dud
2016-03-09 23:26:02	@Espyo	either that or Dolphin sucks at activating codes mid-flight
2016-03-09 23:26:42	@Espyo	okay... I'll circumvent the file select menu with a save state
2016-03-09 23:26:56	ScruffyChat	Heh, good idea
2016-03-09 23:28:04	@Espyo	bleh, no good
2016-03-09 23:28:06	@Espyo	code doesn't work
2016-03-09 23:28:15	@Espyo	or maybe it does work, but doesn't change the day number at the top
2016-03-09 23:28:18	ScruffyChat	Wait
2016-03-09 23:28:28	ScruffyChat	We could just insert this item in a different day file
2016-03-09 23:28:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-09 23:28:40	ScruffyChat	Like, copy it from "0-1" and put it somewhere else
2016-03-09 23:28:50	@Espyo	ok, code doesn't work
2016-03-09 23:28:54	@Espyo	I'm getting the Beady Long Legs
2016-03-09 23:28:54	ScruffyChat	You just have to make sure to increase the number of generators at the beginning of the file by 1
2016-03-09 23:28:57	@Espyo	which doesn't appear till day 30
2016-03-09 23:29:01	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-03-09 23:29:02	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-09 23:29:07	@Espyo	I'll do it real quick, then
2016-03-09 23:30:39	@Espyo	here gos
2016-03-09 23:30:41	@Espyo	*goes
2016-03-09 23:31:19	@Espyo	it loaded
2016-03-09 23:31:21	@Espyo	now to find the cave
2016-03-09 23:32:20	ScruffyChat	It might appear in the pause menu
2016-03-09 23:33:41	@Espyo	(good news, the Beady Long Legs can crush Dwarf Bulbears)
2016-03-09 23:33:45	@Espyo	oh yeah, didn't think of that
2016-03-09 23:34:00	@Espyo	it doesn't
2016-03-09 23:34:06	ScruffyChat	Aww man
2016-03-09 23:34:30	ScruffyChat	Well the ship is at -331.454987 80.000000 1228.323975
2016-03-09 23:34:36	@Espyo	can't see it
2016-03-09 23:34:41	@Espyo	I'll plot it all
2016-03-09 23:35:45	@Espyo	hmmmm
2016-03-09 23:35:51	@Espyo	judging completely blind
2016-03-09 23:35:53	@Espyo	it looks like it's out of bounds
2016-03-09 23:35:59	@Espyo	or maybe not 
2016-03-09 23:36:01	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-03-09 23:36:31	ScruffyChat	Perhaps reset the game with the coordinates changed to something really near the ship?
2016-03-09 23:36:37	ScruffyChat	Just to see if it's even there
2016-03-09 23:36:40	@Espyo	...can't make any sense out of this stupid map
2016-03-09 23:36:58	@Espyo	the coordinates have a lot of numbers near them
2016-03-09 23:37:01	@Espyo	maybe they all play a role
2016-03-09 23:37:07	@Espyo	I could try, but I want to figure out the map
2016-03-09 23:37:10	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-09 23:37:14	@Espyo	either way, it's good to know for the future
2016-03-09 23:37:20	ScruffyChat	Mhm
2016-03-09 23:37:50	ScruffyChat	I'll see if I can access it
2016-03-09 23:38:20	@Espyo	good luck
2016-03-09 23:38:42	ScruffyChat	Also, on only day 4, 3 eggs will drop from the sky around where the Beady Long Legs normally spawns
2016-03-09 23:39:01	Testyo	what are to revive the wiki
2016-03-09 23:39:10	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-09 23:39:46	@Espyo	<ScruffyChat> Well the ship is at -331.454987 80.000000 1228.323975
2016-03-09 23:39:49	@Espyo	what file is it on?
2016-03-09 23:39:57	ScruffyChat	"defaultgen"
2016-03-09 23:40:01	@Espyo	right
2016-03-09 23:40:14	@Espyo	btw, did you ever find the difference between defaultgen and initgen?
2016-03-09 23:40:22	ScruffyChat	Not... really
2016-03-09 23:40:35	@Espyo	so, Pikmin 2 jank
2016-03-09 23:40:37	@Espyo	okay, gotcha
2016-03-09 23:40:51	ScruffyChat	I guess defaultgen holds more importance than initgen, but really they both fill the same purpose
2016-03-09 23:41:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-09 23:41:22	ScruffyChat	Maybe they were always moving the Onion and cave locations by accident so they just put them on separate files
2016-03-09 23:41:50	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-09 23:41:50	@Espyo	maybe
2016-03-09 23:42:05	ScruffyChat	Although, it might be that things are in initgen so that they can respawn if destroyed in several days, like enemies
2016-03-09 23:42:09	@Espyo	ok, 0 0 0 is a bit to the north of the ship
2016-03-09 23:42:14	ScruffyChat	If it's on defaultgen, it'll always be there
2016-03-09 23:42:16	@Espyo	if I know 0 0 0, I know everything
2016-03-09 23:42:22	@Espyo	hm, maybe
2016-03-09 23:42:23	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-09 23:43:22	ScruffyChat	Oh, and one more thing: that was a good point about the Rubber Ugly representing treasure; it's actually the first treasure listed in the treasure files
2016-03-09 23:43:30	ScruffyChat	And the game text files
2016-03-09 23:43:31	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-03-09 23:43:34	@Espyo	so there's more to it than that
2016-03-09 23:43:41	@Espyo	it's also shown in some prerelease images
2016-03-09 23:43:59	ScruffyChat	And it's "ahiru," which is first alphabetically
2016-03-09 23:44:01	@Espyo	we need to expand that, then
2016-03-09 23:44:04	@Espyo	oh yeah!
2016-03-09 23:44:04	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-09 23:44:10	@Espyo	all hail the Rubber Ugly
2016-03-09 23:44:13	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-09 23:44:43	@Espyo	why does defaultgen have 5 Onions
2016-03-09 23:44:58	ScruffyChat	One is the Hocotate ship
2016-03-09 23:45:20	ScruffyChat	Three are your standard Onions
2016-03-09 23:45:26	ScruffyChat	And one is the undiscovered Onion
2016-03-09 23:45:48	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-09 23:45:49	ScruffyChat	You can tell because "after boot?" is set to 0
2016-03-09 23:45:53	@Espyo	oh, neat
2016-03-09 23:46:36	@Espyo	oh...
2016-03-09 23:46:43	@Espyo	that cave
2016-03-09 23:46:51	@Espyo	is right next to the ship
2016-03-09 23:46:55	@Espyo	actually really close
2016-03-09 23:46:57	ScruffyChat	Woah
2016-03-09 23:47:02	@Espyo	still on the rectangular landing area thingie
2016-03-09 23:47:11	@Espyo	and it shares the same Y
2016-03-09 23:47:17	@Espyo	meaning it's not super high in the air or underground
2016-03-09 23:47:21	@Espyo	so either I'm very blind
2016-03-09 23:47:22	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2016-03-09 23:47:25	@Espyo	or the game ignored the cave entrance object
2016-03-09 23:47:30	ScruffyChat	Hmmm
2016-03-09 23:47:45	ScruffyChat	Well where did you put the cave? 10-29?
2016-03-09 23:48:07	@Espyo	initgen
2016-03-09 23:48:13	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-03-09 23:48:21	@Espyo	my save's on day 47, so none of them worked bar initgen
2016-03-09 23:48:24	ScruffyChat	Then the file spawns everything on day 1
2016-03-09 23:48:31	ScruffyChat	and saves that way
2016-03-09 23:48:46	@Espyo	I tried mashing A in the vicinity, tried looking around with free cam
2016-03-09 23:48:48	@Espyo	it's just not there
2016-03-09 23:48:53	@Espyo	well that sucks
2016-03-09 23:49:39	@Espyo	looks like the cave's id is just "test"
2016-03-09 23:49:44	@Espyo	the others are y_01 to y_04
2016-03-09 23:49:56	@Espyo	WHY do these generator files use different IDs from stuff than what everything else in the game does?
2016-03-09 23:50:05	ScruffyChat	I don't know
2016-03-09 23:50:06	@Espyo	everything else in the game calls enemies by their name ID
2016-03-09 23:50:17	@Espyo	"Armor", "WaterOtakara", "Chappy"
2016-03-09 23:50:25	@Espyo	the caves also have long names
2016-03-09 23:50:34	ScruffyChat	But to spawn something on day 47 you'd have to put it in the loop file 50-59 and wait for day 51
2016-03-09 23:50:35	@Espyo	"yakushima_1", "tutorial_2", etc.
2016-03-09 23:50:48	ScruffyChat	gtg
2016-03-09 23:50:49	@Espyo	but the generator files love being small and unintuitive

2016-03-10 14:54:06	Klemen702	but not the full story
2016-03-10 14:54:26	Chiaki_Nanami	you can make image captions that are critical of Putin and so they don't accept that

2016-03-10 14:58:57	Klemen702	ok
2016-03-10 14:58:59	Klemen702	but before i do that
2016-03-10 14:59:04	 *	Klemen702 shoots yoshi2
2016-03-10 14:59:19	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-10 14:59:23	Klemen702	so here's a question
2016-03-10 15:00:03	Klemen702	let's say you were playing a 3D game and killed some monster/animal/human/skeletonthatishuman
2016-03-10 15:00:16	Chiaki_Nanami	skeletonthatishuman
2016-03-10 15:00:24	Klemen702	and had to do some realistic looting
2016-03-10 15:00:27	Klemen702	like
2016-03-10 15:00:36	Klemen702	instead of just gaining ur items in 1 sec
2016-03-10 15:00:50	Klemen702	you have to have a special tool and move it in specific directions to cut shit
2016-03-10 15:00:54	Klemen702	how would you feel about that?
2016-03-10 15:01:24	Chiaki_Nanami	There are a lot of things you could do with such a mechanic.
2016-03-10 15:01:59	Klemen702	yeah
2016-03-10 15:02:07	Chiaki_Nanami	You could make it so that you'd have to skilfully extract the item as to preserve its quality.
2016-03-10 15:02:18	Klemen702	that too
2016-03-10 15:02:31	Chiaki_Nanami	However, you'd have to ensure it's actually worth it, and provide good drop rates.
2016-03-10 15:02:33	Klemen702	some things could not be taken until you get a tool later in the game
2016-03-10 15:02:48	Klemen702	ye
2016-03-10 15:02:50	Klemen702	another flaw
2016-03-10 15:02:57	Klemen702	in my mind with such a system
2016-03-10 15:03:02	Klemen702	is that it might take too much time 
2016-03-10 15:03:08	Chiaki_Nanami	Indeed, you should provide unnaturally high drop rates for things, you just need to make the dissection phase the most interesting part of the deal.
2016-03-10 15:03:10	Klemen702	that it would get boring eventually
2016-03-10 15:03:45	Klemen702	(i'm not actually making anything i just wanted to start this disscussion :P)
2016-03-10 15:04:56	Chiaki_Nanami	You could also have it so that different equipment is necessary dependent on the thing you defeated.
2016-03-10 15:05:56	Klemen702	yes
2016-03-10 15:06:07	Chiaki_Nanami	As with all equipment in games, you'd also have to decide: should the equipment get dull over time?
2016-03-10 15:07:06	Klemen702	no
2016-03-10 15:07:08	Klemen702	fuck that
2016-03-10 15:07:12	Klemen702	i hate games that do that
2016-03-10 15:07:54	Klemen702	espacilly when you get the super OP thing only to find out that after some time it's worthless
2016-03-10 15:09:24	Klemen702	and it becomes worse when you combine it and some sort of ammo system

2016-03-10 21:55:59	En_Passant	oh
2016-03-10 21:56:01	@Espyo	but somebody here might be able to help
2016-03-10 21:56:18	@Espyo	yeah, none of that is telling me particularly anything
2016-03-10 21:56:39	@Espyo	basically, after I saw that 9.5 on the exam, my brain INSTANTLY flushed 100% of the physics knowledge I gathered throughout college
2016-03-10 21:57:17	@Espyo	(a 9.5 rounds to a 10, a 10 is the minimal grade to pass, a 20 is the perfect grade)
2016-03-10 21:57:42	Scruffy	Well let's see, is there any equation that relates the magnitude of the field with radius?
2016-03-10 21:59:53	En_Passant	There's one for the field and another one for the momentum
2016-03-10 21:59:53	En_Passant	But both require the velocity
2016-03-10 22:00:35	Scruffy	Well momentum requires velocity and mass
2016-03-10 22:01:03	En_Passant	Magnetic force is charge*velocity cross field strength

2016-03-10 22:01:18	Scruffy	So if you have the mass of that electron, your angular velocity could be substituted as 3.00*10^25/mass, couldn't it
2016-03-10 22:01:20	Scruffy	?
2016-03-10 22:01:42	En_Passant	oh, you're thinking of translational velocity
2016-03-10 22:01:49	En_Passant	*momentum
2016-03-10 22:01:59	En_Passant	Angular mementum is a different equatoin
2016-03-10 22:02:04	Scruffy	Oops, that I am
2016-03-10 22:02:05	En_Passant	I cannot type today
2016-03-10 22:02:33	En_Passant	Angular momentum is moment of inertia*angular velocity
2016-03-10 22:02:35	Scruffy	So the equation for angular momentum is angular velocity times moment of inertia, correct?
2016-03-10 22:02:41	En_Passant	yeah
2016-03-10 22:02:44	Scruffy	Yes, we're on the same page
2016-03-10 22:02:45	En_Passant	Iw, for short
2016-03-10 22:02:48	Scruffy	Right
2016-03-10 22:02:59	En_Passant	I = MR^2 and w=v/R
2016-03-10 22:03:17	Scruffy	So how would you find a moment of inertia?
2016-03-10 22:03:24	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-03-10 22:03:33	En_Passant	It's a particle, so it's mass*radius^2
2016-03-10 22:03:43	Scruffy	Ah
2016-03-10 22:04:12	En_Passant	So the equation can reduce to 3*10^-25 = MRv
2016-03-10 22:04:18	En_Passant	Mass of a proton is a constant
2016-03-10 22:04:24	En_Passant	Velocity isn't :/
2016-03-10 22:04:30	Scruffy	Ah yeah
2016-03-10 22:04:36	Scruffy	Wait, isn't it an electron?
2016-03-10 22:04:48	En_Passant	oh, yeah, that's what I meant
2016-03-10 22:04:53	Scruffy	Ah okay
2016-03-10 22:05:00	En_Passant	There's another problem that's similar that has a proton
2016-03-10 22:05:16	En_Passant	The other way to do this problem is to use magnetic force
2016-03-10 22:05:54	En_Passant	which is the charge*velocity cross magnetic field strength
2016-03-10 22:06:46	En_Passant	The "centripetal force" is mv^2/r
2016-03-10 22:07:08	En_Passant	(sum of forces towards the center)
2016-03-10 22:07:20	En_Passant	so mv^2/r = qvXb
2016-03-10 22:07:35	En_Passant	m is still constant, as is q, and b is given
2016-03-10 22:07:39	En_Passant	Still requires velocity
2016-03-10 22:09:13	Scruffy	so cross is cross product, right?
2016-03-10 22:09:19	En_Passant	yes
2016-03-10 22:09:37	En_Passant	It's given that it's perpendicular, so it's just multiplication
2016-03-10 22:09:47	Scruffy	I still think we can calculate the moment of inertia
2016-03-10 22:10:00	Scruffy	The radius and mass of an electron should be constant
2016-03-10 22:10:11	En_Passant	it's not radius of the electron
2016-03-10 22:10:16	Scruffy	Ohhh
2016-03-10 22:10:20	Scruffy	Sorry
2016-03-10 22:10:29	En_Passant	It's the radius of the circle the electron's moving in, which is what we're solving for
2016-03-10 22:10:34	Scruffy	Right
2016-03-10 22:11:03	Scruffy	Well I guess we must use magnetic force then
2016-03-10 22:11:17	Scruffy	Somehow, let's see
2016-03-10 22:12:16	Scruffy	What does 2.00 mT have to do with it?
2016-03-10 22:13:23	En_Passant	That's B
2016-03-10 22:13:30	Scruffy	Ah
2016-03-10 22:13:32	Scruffy	Okay
2016-03-10 22:13:53	Scruffy	Well you can substitute velocity

2016-03-10 23:57:44	Bulborbs_At_View	Yeah
2016-03-10 23:57:49	@PikFan	ah, nice
2016-03-10 23:57:50	@PikFan	welcome!
2016-03-10 23:58:09	Bulborbs_At_View	Thanks! I posted in the introductions board actually
2016-03-10 23:58:18	@PikFan	oh, cool
2016-03-10 23:59:48	@PikFan	I haven't been on the forums in a few days
2016-03-11 00:06:25	Bulborbs_At_View	Seems like not many people have been on the forums in a few days xD It feels a bit dead ATM, if I may be honest.
2016-03-11 00:06:44	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-03-11 00:06:58	@PikFan	well, it can't be helped, Pikmin isn't really a popular series
2016-03-11 00:07:07	@PikFan	how I wish it was
2016-03-11 00:09:52	Bulborbs_At_View	Yeah... but at least it's not dead, which is always a plus
2016-03-11 00:10:15	@PikFan	true
2016-03-11 00:10:40	@PikFan	hopefully Pikmin 4 will revitalize the community... if they're even going to release it
2016-03-11 00:15:12	Bulborbs_At_View	I don't see why they wouldn't. The game was almost finished from what the interview said
2016-03-11 00:16:30	@PikFan	when Nintendo says something is "almost finished", I take that with a massive grain of salt
2016-03-11 00:16:45	@PikFan	it's half a year later, we still haven't heard anything
2016-03-11 00:17:02	@PikFan	so it probably wasn't really "almost finished"
2016-03-11 00:18:55	Bulborbs_At_View	My guess is that it will end up being a NX game, and they're waiting to reveal it at E3 along with that. Maybe.
2016-03-11 00:19:12	@PikFan	I really hope it's not a NX game
2016-03-11 00:19:30	@PikFan	I mean, sure, that'd be cool, but I don't want to have to buy another console
2016-03-11 00:19:57	@PikFan	I'm looking at a summer release, like Pikmin 3

2016-03-11 18:46:07	@Espyo	ok, I've been seeing some laptops
2016-03-11 18:46:14	@Espyo	this Lenovo Y700 is apparently excellent
2016-03-11 18:46:19	@Espyo	(bit costly though)
2016-03-11 18:46:34	@Espyo	thing is, it is known to not support the network card right away
2016-03-11 18:46:39	@Espyo	but installations and/or fixes are simple
2016-03-11 18:46:40	@Espyo	my problem is
2016-03-11 18:47:06	@Espyo	I am SCARED SHITLESS that because the support isn't stable from the get-go, I might get problems in the future
2016-03-11 18:47:07	Testyo	Are you sure you needed to swear?
2016-03-11 18:47:16	@Espyo	like yeah, I can install this or that driver, and it works
2016-03-11 18:47:30	@Espyo	but the fact that it's not perfect compatibility makes me scared that I might find problems like...
2016-03-11 18:47:41	@Espyo	one out of every 10 boots I can't connect to my router until I reboot the machine
2016-03-11 18:47:47	@Espyo	what do you say, J?

2016-03-11 20:03:36	@J	I don't know, I never really had any hardware problems on any computer
2016-03-11 20:04:21	@J	there was one laptop where the installation system didn't support the wifi chip, but the drivers for it _were_ there once installed
2016-03-11 20:04:51	@J	I would suspect that 'not support the network card' is more likely to mean just the wireless, BTW
2016-03-11 20:04:56	@J	never heard of ethernet not working
2016-03-11 20:05:02	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-11 20:05:12	@Espyo	still, I don't have direct access to the router
2016-03-11 20:05:17	@J	oh, really?
2016-03-11 20:05:22	@Espyo	I do, but it's away from my room
2016-03-11 20:05:32	@Espyo	it has to be in the middle of the house, for wireless access to everybody in their rooms
2016-03-11 20:05:38	@J	right, yeah
2016-03-11 20:05:49	@J	you only need enough access to get wireless working
2016-03-11 20:06:09	@Espyo	not quite sure I follow
2016-03-11 20:06:15	@J	which, as I said, for me has never been more time than doing the installation
2016-03-11 20:06:38	@J	as in, I hooked it up via ethernet while installing, then wifi worked on reboot into the installed system
2016-03-11 20:06:47	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-03-11 20:06:49	@Espyo	I get you now
2016-03-11 20:06:54	@Espyo	hmm, okay
2016-03-11 20:06:58	@Espyo	see, it's weird... for me, it's the exact opposite
2016-03-11 20:07:06	@Espyo	ALL computers I ever had had at least one stupid problem
2016-03-11 20:07:10	@Espyo	regardless of OS
2016-03-11 20:07:18	@Espyo	regardless of brand, specs, what have you
2016-03-11 20:07:31	@J	yeah, that's just computers being complicated
2016-03-11 20:07:41	@Espyo	this most recent one refuses to connect to the internet one out of every three boots
2016-03-11 20:07:55	@J	I've probably been pretty lucky, really
2016-03-11 20:08:00	@Espyo	I'd say that's not so much "just a silly thing" as it is "this should actually not be allowed"
2016-03-11 20:08:09	@Espyo	it sure sounds like it
2016-03-11 20:08:12	@Espyo	I'm not even safe at work
2016-03-11 20:08:16	@J	OTOH if I find an issue I probably fix it and then forget it ever happened
2016-03-11 20:08:21	@Espyo	my Lenovo with Ubuntu randomly freezes for a few seconds
2016-03-11 20:08:27	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-11 20:08:31	@Espyo	guess that IS a thing with windows, huh
2016-03-11 20:08:35	@Espyo	there is no "fixing it"
2016-03-11 20:08:58	@Espyo	I'm just... terrified, you know?
2016-03-11 20:09:04	@Espyo	I'm investing a pretty penny on this new laptop
2016-03-11 20:09:16	@Espyo	I want something to keep me comfortable and stable for quite a few years
2016-03-11 20:09:26	@Espyo	even if the specs start becoming outdated for the most recent games
2016-03-11 20:09:30	@Espyo	a reliable machine is still a plus
2016-03-11 20:09:38	@Espyo	but from past experiences, stuff can go south so quickly
2016-03-11 20:10:09	@J	yeah, I probably wouldn't have bought a computer intending to drop Windows entirely if I didn't already have a few years' experience running Linux
2016-03-11 20:10:13	@Espyo	and spending 1000 Euro on a machine that'll make every other day of my life misery because it randomly freezes, or the wireless stops working, or the hard drive becomes unbearably slow...
2016-03-11 20:10:13	Testyo	1000 Euro = £ 706.6  / $ 1087.2 
2016-03-11 20:10:32	@Espyo	right
2016-03-11 20:10:43	@Espyo	still... I have to make the change some time
2016-03-11 20:10:53	@Espyo	otherwise I never get to that "few years' experience" part myself
2016-03-11 20:11:07	@J	well, I mean I was dual-booting for a few years
2016-03-11 20:11:20	@J	just hardly using the Windows installation
2016-03-11 20:11:23	@Espyo	well, in that case, I'm on the right track, since I'll be dual-booting too
2016-03-11 20:11:32	@Espyo	yeah, and hardly using the windows install, exactly
2016-03-11 20:11:41	@Espyo	but still
2016-03-11 20:12:19	@J	so if it doesn't work out, use Windows, pretty simple
2016-03-11 20:12:38	@Espyo	well, that's just it, I want to stop using windows
2016-03-11 20:12:45	@Espyo	I'm sick and tired of not having the control I want
2016-03-11 20:12:56	@Espyo	I'm sick and tired of wanting to run a tool to convert 1000 files, and having no good way to do so
2016-03-11 20:13:14	@Espyo	sick and tired of trying to compile something in C++ and it taking me a week to finally get the libraries synched up and everything
2016-03-11 20:13:23	@Espyo	tired of downloading anything and getting a warning that it could be a virus before running it
2016-03-11 20:13:31	@J	then you're choosing between that and the money
2016-03-11 20:13:51	@Espyo	tired of pathetic tiny glitches that should've be fixed days after being detected, but get ignored instead
2016-03-11 20:13:52	@Espyo	how so?
2016-03-11 20:15:06	@J	you said you were worried about spending a lot on something that might not work
2016-03-11 20:15:49	@J	you're worried about taking a risk, but you don't want to use Windows forever
2016-03-11 20:15:57	@Espyo	choosing between windows which will work, but has all of the inconveniences, versus jumping into uncertainty, but with the promise of better life quality
2016-03-11 20:15:57	@J	so you have to choose one
2016-03-11 20:16:03	@J	that, or live with cheap computers forever
2016-03-11 20:16:09	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-11 20:16:20	@Espyo	I guess I want to take the risk
2016-03-11 20:16:28	@Espyo	I mean... I use Ubuntu daily now thanks to work
2016-03-11 20:16:31	@Espyo	and it... works pretty well
2016-03-11 20:16:40	@Espyo	so all in all, it doesn't seem like such a big risk
2016-03-11 20:16:48	@Espyo	but of course, when you're still planning, everything seems like a huge risk
2016-03-11 20:17:14	Yoshi2	I used lubuntu on my desktop with success (dolphin, video editing with ffmpeg/avconv)
2016-03-11 20:17:26	Yoshi2	and in a VM on my notebook for programming
2016-03-11 20:17:36	@Espyo	that's what I'm aiming for
2016-03-11 20:17:48	@Espyo	all I want is a system where stuff actually works
2016-03-11 20:17:53	@Espyo	it... can't be too much to ask for
2016-03-11 20:19:37	@J	one day I will get there
2016-03-11 20:19:38	@J	one day
2016-03-11 20:20:21	@Espyo	what problems do you get nowadays?
2016-03-11 20:21:15	@J	oh, I mean I keep changing stuff to make things more efficient/usable, but I rarely get the whole way through, leaving things mostly better but with weird edge cases I have to work around when I hit them
2016-03-11 20:21:30	@Espyo	right
2016-03-11 20:21:33	@Espyo	got any examples?
2016-03-11 20:21:39	@J	such as, when I switched from firefox to uzbl, I lost tab history preservation and haven't reimplemented it
2016-03-11 20:21:46	@Espyo	ah
2016-03-11 20:21:57	@J	uzbl _allows_ me to implement it, but I haven't done it
2016-03-11 20:22:09	@Espyo	although, I also know you like to try different stuff out and try to get the best possible
2016-03-11 20:22:27	@Espyo	heck, I'd just be happy with an environment where I can make games with Allegro until the day I die
2016-03-11 20:22:41	@J	also I wanted to set up a configuration system to generate config files that work across the different computers I use
2016-03-11 20:22:59	@J	currently I have to port changes I make to each system as I make them, maybe with tweaks
2016-03-11 20:23:22	@J	I started learning ansible some time ago for this, but never finished it
2016-03-11 20:23:48	@Espyo	right
2016-03-11 20:24:10	@Espyo	but, you get closer to what you want each time
2016-03-11 20:24:23	@Espyo	even if three steps forward is two steps back
2016-03-11 20:24:40	@J	mhm
2016-03-11 20:24:51	@J	any day now, it'll be perfect
2016-03-11 20:25:04	@J	maybe a few more years
2016-03-11 20:25:11	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-11 20:29:38	Yoshi2	https://xkcd.com/1319/
2016-03-11 20:30:45	@Espyo	oh yeah, I was searching for it a few days ago
2016-03-11 20:30:48	@Espyo	always relevant
2016-03-11 20:31:01	@Espyo	hm, is it just me, or are the more recent XKCD strips losing their touch?
2016-03-11 20:31:06	@Espyo	they're pretty nonsense lately

2016-03-11 20:36:50	Yoshi2	that's probably just the result of the author doing the strips regularly
2016-03-11 20:38:13	@Espyo	yeah, you have to run out of ideas eventually
2016-03-11 20:38:15	@Espyo	but...
2016-03-11 20:38:24	@Espyo	he could still probably come up with better

2016-03-11 20:59:16	Klemen702	question i probably asked many months ago but forgot
2016-03-11 20:59:45	Klemen702	what's with these ALWAYS afk users such as smuckola, gamefreak75 etc.
2016-03-11 21:00:19	Klemen702	they speak less than J
2016-03-11 21:02:07	@J	heeey
2016-03-11 21:02:32	Yoshi2	they don't talk much in this channel, but maybe they are active on other channels
2016-03-11 21:03:09	Yoshi2	I know m6 is sometimes active on other channels, and smuckola said some stuff some months ago
2016-03-11 21:03:24	Klemen702	''some months ago''
2016-03-11 21:03:36	Klemen702	tho
2016-03-11 21:03:44	Klemen702	i don't get why their accounts are always active
2016-03-11 21:03:50	Klemen702	is it some sort of feature?
2016-03-11 21:04:10	Klemen702	becuz i do see you write ''offline|yoshi2'' at times
2016-03-11 21:04:26	Yoshi2	they keep their computer on 24/7 or use a bouncer
2016-03-11 21:04:42	Klemen702	bouncer?
2016-03-11 21:04:46	Yoshi2	irc bouncer
2016-03-11 21:04:58	Klemen702	which is?
2016-03-11 21:05:57	Yoshi2	a program that stays connected to irc servers and receives all the messages people write, so when you connect to the program it sends you all those messages
2016-03-11 21:06:11	Klemen702	what's the point...?
2016-03-11 21:07:44	Yoshi2	well, I can't be online 24/7 with my own computer, so I use that to receive all messages that I'd miss if I didn't have the bouncer
2016-03-11 21:08:03	Yoshi2	it also helps that the bouncer usually runs on a server, for example
2016-03-11 21:08:04	Klemen702	hm
2016-03-11 21:08:27	Klemen702	i see
2016-03-11 21:09:03	Klemen702	guess it's good if you don't have skype or use mibbit on a site that has no talkpages
2016-03-11 21:09:57	Yoshi2	bouncers are useful even for people with skype or for people who don't use mibbit
2016-03-11 21:10:13	Yoshi2	I use hexchat, for example
2016-03-11 21:10:14	Klemen702	explain more
2016-03-11 21:10:27	Yoshi2	skype sucks
2016-03-11 21:10:29	Yoshi2	'nuff said
2016-03-11 21:10:56	Klemen702	*gasp*
2016-03-11 21:11:00	Yoshi2	also, I'm in a lot of channels on irc networks which don't have skype equivalents
2016-03-11 21:11:38	Klemen702	kay
2016-03-11 21:11:44	@Espyo	enemy for the next update is a simple Sheargrub, for those wondering
2016-03-11 21:11:52	@Espyo	hm, I might be able to do both classic Sheargrubs
2016-03-11 21:12:00	Klemen702	male/female/lemale?
2016-03-11 21:12:08	Klemen702	okie
2016-03-11 21:14:22	Klemen702	speaking of skype
2016-03-11 21:14:25	Klemen702	http://pasteboard.co/2c6yMcAT.png
2016-03-11 21:14:29	Yoshi2	my irc client usually runs all day, but for the night I turn my computer off so the bouncer becomes useful while I'm offline or away from the internet
2016-03-11 21:14:56	Klemen702	is this successful enough?
2016-03-11 21:15:07	Klemen702	(talking about my pic)
2016-03-11 21:15:33	Yoshi2	some people probably just leave their irc client run all the time, but I can't do that due to my (sometimes) rather unstable connection
2016-03-11 21:16:00	Yoshi2	four times the charm
2016-03-11 21:16:15	Yoshi2	you are a very successful password changer

2016-03-11 21:22:15	Yoshi2	instead of dealing with names such as cTextureResource, or cNodeHierarchyResource,
2016-03-11 21:22:16	Klemen702	have someone else do it for u while u sleep
2016-03-11 21:22:21	Yoshi2	I just added a constant for those
2016-03-11 21:22:38	Yoshi2	TEXTURE = cTextureResource, MODEL = cNodeHierarchyResource

2016-03-12 10:48:23	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-03-12 10:48:24	Testyo	so I'm hoping that page is that aint for me
2016-03-12 10:48:40	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-12 10:51:41	Yoshi2	I realized I am a bit more productive when I wear pants
2016-03-12 10:51:50	Yoshi2	more specifically, jeans
2016-03-12 10:52:26	@Espyo	make me wear jeans at work
2016-03-12 10:52:29	@Espyo	and you're a normal person
2016-03-12 10:52:32	@Espyo	make me wear jeans at home
2016-03-12 10:52:36	@Espyo	and I'll chew your face off
2016-03-12 10:52:47	@Espyo	how can you be more... ANYTHING with jeans?
2016-03-12 10:52:58	@Espyo	they're so tight and cold and weird to the touch and...
2016-03-12 10:53:13	Yoshi2	I actually feel less cold with them on
2016-03-12 10:53:24	Yoshi2	which probably contributes to me being more productive
2016-03-12 10:53:42	@Espyo	well, when compared to nothing, sure, I guess
2016-03-12 10:53:49	@Espyo	but jeans are the coldest type of pants out there
2016-03-12 10:55:02	Yoshi2	I don't have that many different pant types
2016-03-12 10:57:26	Yoshi2	I have some leggings, some thick-ish pants for being at home but they are very loose, jeans
2016-03-12 10:57:29	Yoshi2	aaaaaaaaand that's about it
2016-03-12 10:57:57	Yoshi2	and some short pants but I don't like to wear them in winter
2016-03-12 11:08:25	Yoshi2	in theory, I already figured out the modding thing
2016-03-12 11:08:30	Yoshi2	but actually implementing it...
2016-03-12 11:11:44	@Espyo	what about for wearing at home?
2016-03-12 11:12:03	@Espyo	yeah, that's always the thing with theory and practice
2016-03-12 11:13:54	Yoshi2	a bit too cold to wear them at home, too
2016-03-12 11:39:10	Yoshi2	ugh, this is so much manual work
2016-03-12 11:39:17	@Espyo	ouch
2016-03-12 11:39:20	Yoshi2	I basically need to pick out which resources I can replace
2016-03-12 11:39:56	Yoshi2	if I could just add all the resources I need, this would be no problem
2016-03-12 11:40:01	Yoshi2	but the game didn't like that
2016-03-12 11:41:32	Yoshi2	well, if my idea works out, I can work on actually adding resources
2016-03-12 11:51:13	Yoshi2	there is some sort of rocket league infestation
2016-03-12 11:51:41	@Espyo	oh?
2016-03-12 11:52:51	Yoshi2	almost everybody in my steam friends list is playing the game
2016-03-12 11:53:58	@Espyo	hehehe

2016-03-12 12:21:38	Yoshi2	alright, let's see if this works
2016-03-12 12:24:40	Yoshi2	this will either work or break horribly
2016-03-12 12:24:53	Yoshi2	mfw it worked
2016-03-12 12:26:14	@Espyo	whaaaa
2016-03-12 12:26:48	Yoshi2	well, I only modified the xml file but it's still pretty hype
2016-03-12 12:27:13	Yoshi2	means that if I modify the resource file too, what I thought of should work
2016-03-12 12:32:24	Yoshi2	alright, time to do another thing before I go to replacing resource files
2016-03-12 12:33:42	Yoshi2	oh fuck you game
2016-03-12 12:33:42	Testyo	Are you sure you needed to swear?
2016-03-12 12:33:47	Yoshi2	why did you have to do this to me

2016-03-12 12:36:16	Yoshi2	freezes right on choosing the level, which is unusual

2016-03-12 12:46:59	Yoshi2	whywhywyhwyhwyhwhwhywhywhy
2016-03-12 12:50:48	Yoshi2	WELL
2016-03-12 12:50:52	Yoshi2	change of plans
2016-03-12 12:54:45	Yoshi2	I always have a plan B for this stuff
2016-03-12 12:59:42	Yoshi2	and plan B is more complicated than plan A
2016-03-12 13:00:35	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-12 13:02:10	Yoshi2	I have a silly plan C in case B doesn't work
2016-03-12 13:02:16	Yoshi2	and if C doesn't work, then
2016-03-12 13:02:20	Yoshi2	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ 
2016-03-12 13:03:36	Yoshi2	plan D would probably involve a lot of manual work

2016-03-12 18:44:51	En_Passant	Okay, I'm confused
2016-03-12 18:45:10	En_Passant	Daylight Savings is supposed to start today, but none of my clocks have updated
2016-03-12 18:46:49	Yoshi2	please no more dst, please no more dst
2016-03-12 18:47:17	@Espyo	please NEVER dst
2016-03-12 18:47:22	@Espyo	can't we just as humans get rid of it
2016-03-12 18:48:09	En_Passant	I wish
2016-03-12 18:52:44	Klemen702	i'm one of those people that think DST is a neat idea...
2016-03-12 18:53:32	@Espyo	it WAS
2016-03-12 18:53:32	Bulborbs_At_View	It's supposed to be on Sunday at 1AM
2016-03-12 18:53:37	@Espyo	it's not justified now
2016-03-12 18:54:09	Klemen702	WAS?
2016-03-12 18:54:13	Bulborbs_At_View	The only reason I like DST is that in November it turns back time by 1 hour and I love the illusion of getting an extra hour by staying up until then
2016-03-12 18:54:14	Klemen702	what changed?
2016-03-12 18:54:42	Klemen702	at the current time it's good for me
2016-03-12 18:55:11	Bulborbs_At_View	What I don't like is "losing" an hour in march. Right now I barely get enough sleep as it is >_>
2016-03-12 18:55:40	@J	I figure if clocks change over seasons, it could help reduce traffic accidents if it's such that fewer people are driving in the dark
2016-03-12 18:55:47	@J	not sure if DST actually does that
2016-03-12 18:56:13	Klemen702	losing just 1 hour is not a big deal
2016-03-12 18:56:25	Klemen702	there are so many people that have to move through many times zones
2016-03-12 18:56:30	En_Passant	Oh, wait, today's not Sunday
2016-03-12 18:56:33	En_Passant	oops
2016-03-12 18:56:34	Klemen702	those are the guys that have it a bit bad
2016-03-12 18:56:42	Klemen702	lol
2016-03-12 18:56:54	Yoshi2	as it is right now, in winter it is dark as hell
2016-03-12 18:56:55	Yoshi2	dst or not
2016-03-12 18:57:27	Klemen702	actually
2016-03-12 18:57:29	Klemen702	spring has started
2016-03-12 18:57:33	Yoshi2	might as well get rid of dst because it doesn't do much
2016-03-12 18:57:43	Klemen702	(/s)
2016-03-12 18:58:22	Klemen702	(well it actually has started but the /s is supposed to tell what i said should not be taken seriousy lel)
2016-03-12 18:59:22	@J	could change it to -2 or something in winter, so it's light in the morning
2016-03-12 18:59:37	@J	or whichever way it works, too lazy to think about it
2016-03-12 18:59:59	En_Passant	dst isn't during winter
2016-03-12 19:00:43	@J	hence 'change'
2016-03-12 19:00:56	Yoshi2	just leave it at one thing and be done with it
2016-03-12 19:02:12	Klemen702	eh
2016-03-12 19:02:19	Klemen702	i don't feel like contributing to this topic anymore but
2016-03-12 19:02:24	En_Passant	I don't think a 2 hour time change at once would go over very well
2016-03-12 19:02:29	Klemen702	i still don't get why people think it's a big thing to deal with
2016-03-12 19:02:41	Bulborbs_At_View	It's certainly disorienting at first
2016-03-12 19:03:12	Bulborbs_At_View	And it's not really relevant in the modern world. It used to be used so workers would have more daylight after work, or something like that. Or something about plants...
2016-03-12 19:03:19	Bulborbs_At_View	But that was a long time ago.
2016-03-12 19:03:40	Klemen702	doesn't that still work tho?
2016-03-12 19:04:07	Yoshi2	not when winter is always dark as hell, and spring/summer is very bright
2016-03-12 19:19:45	Bulborbs_At_View	Found this http://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/history.html
2016-03-12 19:21:06	Bulborbs_At_View	Doesn't explain much about why though :/
2016-03-12 19:21:28	Bulborbs_At_View	Just says it saves energy.
2016-03-12 20:01:14	En_Passant	so, about the carriers thing
2016-03-12 20:02:17	En_Passant	Since having the Pikmin on that fall off is temporary, I would include the "true true" number of carriers as a mouseover
2016-03-12 20:12:37	@Espyo	I think we should include both numbers... somehow
2016-03-12 20:14:04	Yoshi2	mysql_escape

2016-03-12 20:14:15	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-12 20:14:35	Yoshi2	(or something like that, don't remember the exact function names)
2016-03-12 20:17:31	Yoshi2	before I left earlier today, I was doing something in BW and I forgot what I was doing
2016-03-12 20:17:39	Yoshi2	time to remember that...
2016-03-12 20:19:59	En_Passant	I think it would be too technical/confusing to users to have 3 different carrying numbers in the stats table
2016-03-12 20:21:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-12 20:21:51	@Espyo	the "main" carrier number, the one readers expect, should be the one to be displayed
2016-03-12 20:23:14	@Espyo	and then a tooltip explaining like "10 grounded Pikmin and 10 Winged Pikmin (total of 20) can also carry this object, but the grounded Pikmin will eventually fall off. 10 grounded Pikmin and 5 Winged Pikmin (total of 15) will be able to carry it all the way."
2016-03-12 20:26:56	Yoshi2	I remembered what I was doing, and it seems my idea did not work
2016-03-12 20:27:05	Yoshi2	TIME FOR PLAN D

2016-03-13 12:44:02	Yoshi2	ok, I found something very hype in the textures of BW1
2016-03-13 12:44:28	Yoshi2	map pictures of old versions of the levels
2016-03-13 12:46:26	Yoshi2	I'll add that to the to-do list on the new article
2016-03-13 12:51:18	@Espyo	ooh
2016-03-13 13:25:54	Yoshi2	oddly enough, the final level map picture is made of 4 images each being 640x640
2016-03-13 13:26:05	Yoshi2	so the result is 1280x1280
2016-03-13 13:26:11	Yoshi2	now imagine that as a png
2016-03-13 13:26:56	@Espyo	neat
2016-03-13 13:27:12	Yoshi2	the dev image is 640x640

2016-03-13 15:36:59	@J	I haven't really followed how user-friendly distributions handled it, I just disabled Secure Boot on my computer
2016-03-13 15:37:42	@Espyo	right, I disabled it on mine as well
2016-03-13 15:38:00	@Espyo	trying Lubuntu, without installing, makes it crash on the loading screen ALMOST all the time
2016-03-13 15:38:03	@Espyo	it actually went through once
2016-03-13 15:38:12	@Espyo	google is being especially non-helpful today
2016-03-13 15:38:21	@Espyo	can't really be bothered with it today
2016-03-13 15:38:29	@Espyo	I'm only really going to start installing and such in a week
2016-03-13 15:38:31	@Espyo	but still, ugh
2016-03-13 15:38:40	@J	what makes you think it has to do with UEFI?
2016-03-13 15:38:53	@Espyo	I'm not sure, but it's my best bet atm
2016-03-13 15:39:01	@Espyo	I've read so many contradicting things in search results
2016-03-13 15:40:12	@J	what does 'crash' mean?
2016-03-13 15:40:32	@Espyo	crash as in it just stays stuck there
2016-03-13 15:40:48	@Espyo	I read that F6 will hide the graphical "loading" screen (the one with the dots) and will show you a command line that'll print an error, if any
2016-03-13 15:40:52	@Espyo	but for me, no key does anything
2016-03-13 15:41:43	@J	maybe try ctrl+alt+F? for all the F keys, but I'm not sure how exactly it works
2016-03-13 15:42:09	@Espyo	yeah, the ones that switch from graphical interface to a command line thing
2016-03-13 15:42:10	@Espyo	tried those too
2016-03-13 15:42:13	@Espyo	still nothing
2016-03-13 15:42:24	@Espyo	I didn't do anything different on the time that it did load successfully
2016-03-13 15:42:47	@J	I would suggest just redoing the image, maybe using a different USB/CD, try a different distribution, etc.
2016-03-13 15:42:59	@J	oh, it worked once?
2016-03-13 15:43:02	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-13 15:43:17	@J	that really does sound like a faulty image
2016-03-13 15:43:35	@Espyo	and yeah, I tried Lubuntu 16.04, 15.10, creating the live CD (well, USB stick) with several different programs, ...
2016-03-13 15:43:42	@Espyo	other people complain about getting stuck at the same point I get stuck
2016-03-13 15:43:52	@Espyo	but the solutions on the threads never work
2016-03-13 15:43:55	@J	hmm...
2016-03-13 15:45:01	Yoshi2	did you burn the image at the slowest speed?
2016-03-13 15:45:05	Yoshi2	or somewhat slow speed
2016-03-13 15:45:21	@Espyo	none of the programs I used had burn speed settings
2016-03-13 15:45:26	@Espyo	but either way, it WAS on a USB stick
2016-03-13 15:45:28	@J	I personally never use CDs or DVDs, USB is just faster
2016-03-13 15:45:44	@Espyo	yeah, plus I don't really have many CDs about to burn
2016-03-13 15:45:54	@Espyo	also interestingly, this laptop's DVD reader is external
2016-03-13 15:45:57	@J	I've always used UNetBootIn, for what it's worth
2016-03-13 15:46:01	@Espyo	so hooking that up would be another step
2016-03-13 15:46:09	@Espyo	yeah, UNetBootin was my first try
2016-03-13 15:46:33	@Espyo	one of the solutions I read was that somebody managed okay with kernel 4.4
2016-03-13 15:46:41	@Espyo	which is only a thing in L/Ubuntu 16
2016-03-13 15:46:48	@Espyo	which doesn't have live boot
2016-03-13 15:46:59	@Espyo	I'd REALLY rather give it a test spin before installing it
2016-03-13 15:48:13	@J	it doesn't?
2016-03-13 15:48:15	@J	why not?

2016-03-13 15:48:59	@Espyo	the option is just not there on the menu
2016-03-13 15:49:07	@J	oh, I guess it wouldn't be released yet
2016-03-13 15:49:12	@J	since it's not yet April
2016-03-13 15:49:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-13 15:49:20	@Espyo	forgot to mention that it's a beta atm, sorry
2016-03-13 15:49:27	@J	yeah, that's probably why
2016-03-13 15:49:35	@Espyo	sucks
2016-03-13 15:49:43	@Espyo	I can wait a few more weeks
2016-03-13 15:49:45	@J	try something not Ubuntu?
2016-03-13 15:50:00	@J	like Fedora, OpenSUSE, whatever people use nowadays
2016-03-13 15:50:11	@J	Mandriva I think?
2016-03-13 15:50:22	@Espyo	not quite sure if I'm that ready for such a different distro from what I'm used to
2016-03-13 15:50:34	@Espyo	the Ubuntu family has the support and such that I need for a smooth transition away from windows
2016-03-13 15:53:03	@J	Mint?
2016-03-13 15:53:19	@J	I think Mint still uses Ubuntu as a base
2016-03-13 15:53:20	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-13 15:53:47	@J	or just another Ubuntu, like Xubuntu, or I think there's one with Mate as the desktop
2016-03-13 15:54:04	@J	at least to see if it works
2016-03-13 15:54:10	@Espyo	well, I WAS trying Lubuntu
2016-03-13 15:54:14	@Espyo	but
2016-03-13 15:55:57	@J	I switched from Ubuntu to Mint for a few months before switching to Arch, whenever that was
2016-03-13 15:56:00	@J	2010 maybe?
2016-03-13 15:56:12	@Espyo	hm, Mint looks nice
2016-03-13 15:56:51	@J	I last tried it a year or two ago, and it felt like it had come a long way, really polished interface
2016-03-13 15:58:01	@J	hmm, I think if you go to any distribution popularity ranking and pick something from the top 10, you won't have any issues finding support
2016-03-13 15:58:10	@Espyo	guess not
2016-03-13 15:58:14	@J	and I think Mint is generally #1
2016-03-13 15:58:19	@Espyo	I'm more worried about immediate compatibility atm, anyway
2016-03-13 15:58:27	@Espyo	I mean, with the whole "stuck on the loading screen" thing
2016-03-13 15:58:41	@Espyo	makes me not worried about flavors as much as actually getting stuff to work
2016-03-13 15:58:50	@Espyo	I can bet on it being a <4.4 kernel problem
2016-03-13 15:58:58	@J	yeah, it's strange, I can't recall ever having that happen, across many computers, many live CDs
2016-03-13 15:58:59	@Espyo	tomorrow I'll buy some DVDs, create a recovery image for windows 10
2016-03-13 15:59:10	@Espyo	and then just dive right in to installing the Lubuntu 16 alpha
2016-03-13 15:59:16	@Espyo	if something goes wrong, recovery CDs
2016-03-13 15:59:48	@J	looks like I only got Linux 4.4 at the start of February, so it's still pretty new
2016-03-13 15:59:49	@Espyo	I THINK that some years back, like 4 or 5, when I tried to dual-boot Ubuntu 12 with windows 7, was it? on one of my laptops
2016-03-13 15:59:50	@Espyo	I had the same problem
2016-03-13 16:00:36	@J	I believe most computers nowadays also have a recovery partition on the disk, and an option in EFI to restore from it
2016-03-13 16:00:54	@Espyo	this one has a recovery partition, yeah
2016-03-13 16:01:11	@Espyo	not quite sure if it's filled with actual recovery data or just trash, though
2016-03-13 16:02:29	@Espyo	see, I'm searching for people using ubuntu 16 on this exact laptop brand, a Lenovo Y700
2016-03-13 16:02:35	@Espyo	and there are several results of people doing fine
2016-03-13 16:02:49	@Espyo	except for the wireless problem we talked about a few days back
2016-03-13 16:02:57	@Espyo	so it's definitely possible to install
2016-03-13 16:03:20	@Espyo	and I can't find many discussions about people getting choked anywhere pre-installation
2016-03-13 16:11:16	@J	I thought the wireless problem was hypothetical
2016-03-13 16:11:42	@Espyo	heh, nope
2016-03-13 16:13:26	@Espyo	screw this, honestly
2016-03-13 16:13:33	@Espyo	I'll try to install after I create backups for windows
2016-03-13 16:17:36	@J	I don't know, I thought you hadn't got the computer then, since you were worried about getting one
2016-03-13 16:19:36	@Espyo	the network thing is real, in that there are a few threads of people complaining about them
2016-03-13 16:19:58	@Espyo	as for me, I bought it yesterday, since they weren't meant to have it in stock, but actually did, from another store? eh, it's confusing
2016-03-13 16:20:04	@Espyo	but long story short, I got the laptop yesterday
2016-03-13 16:20:23	@Espyo	and yeah, besides windows, the most I managed on the Linux front is to try a couple of different distros and versions with a USB stick
2016-03-13 16:20:50	@Espyo	and only ONCE managed to get it to run without installation, on Lubuntu 15
2016-03-13 16:25:44	@J	oh, I get it now

2016-03-13 21:52:19	Yoshi2	PikFan: please, it was 20 minutes
2016-03-13 21:52:52	@PikFan	because clearly 19 = 20
2016-03-13 21:52:56	@PikFan	okay
2016-03-13 21:54:03	Bulborbs_At_View	I'm doing alright.
2016-03-13 21:54:48	Yoshi2	well, it's close enough for me
2016-03-13 21:54:58	Bulborbs_At_View	Should be working on an assignment but I'm instead distracted by my Pikmin-related project xD

2016-03-13 21:59:09	Yoshi2	seconds are important
2016-03-13 21:59:22	Yoshi2	I do not like to use clients which don't show seconds
2016-03-13 21:59:30	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-13 21:59:44	Bulborbs_At_View	Seconds can mean lives
2016-03-13 21:59:49	@PikFan	what about milliseconds
2016-03-13 21:59:54	@PikFan	or microseconds
2016-03-13 21:59:59	@PikFan	or nanoseconds
2016-03-13 22:01:00	Yoshi2	at some point, lag means that milliseconds are meaningless
2016-03-13 22:01:09	Yoshi2	but I might be able to enable them too
2016-03-13 22:01:23	@PikFan	wow
2016-03-13 22:01:29	@PikFan	wait, what client do you use
2016-03-13 22:02:43	Yoshi2	nope, no milliseconds

2016-03-13 22:22:53	@PikFan	oh, my dream might've been influenced by that fanfiction I read last night
2016-03-13 22:23:16	@PikFan	well, it's still weird, because in the fanfiction, the theme was snowball fights vs skiing
2016-03-13 22:23:38	@PikFan	and the real Splatfest theme is SNOWMEN vs sandcastles
2016-03-13 22:24:06	@PikFan	wow

2016-03-14 18:48:23	Yoshi2	there was something I wanted to say to you, but I forgot what it was
2016-03-14 18:50:33	Yoshi2	ah, I remember now
2016-03-14 18:50:51	Yoshi2	I figured out why the advancewars subreddit is so crap
2016-03-14 18:51:10	Yoshi2	the head mod is a trump supporter ( °▽ °)

2016-03-14 19:02:32	Yoshi2	well, one doesn't have to be caused by the other, but his comments smell slightly of TopMind-ery
2016-03-14 19:03:06	Yoshi2	and the moderation might slightly suffer under that
2016-03-14 19:03:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-14 19:10:46	Yoshi2	I also have some plans for the battalionwars sub, and when I have time I will get working on a new banner

2016-03-14 23:29:54	@PikFan	so apparently a lot of American players are upset by Callie's slang in the Splatfest announcement
2016-03-14 23:30:02	@PikFan	I really don't see the issue with it
2016-03-14 23:30:20	@PikFan	being a teenager, I found it quite amusing
2016-03-14 23:30:34	@Espyo	because Nintendo is paying executive producers 3000 USD a month to come up with lines for Splatfest
2016-03-14 23:30:34	Testyo	3000 USD = 2759.1 € / £ 1949.7 
2016-03-14 23:30:52	@PikFan	dang
2016-03-14 23:30:56	@Espyo	and they just shit out the least effort thing that pleases the lowest common denominator
2016-03-14 23:30:57	@PikFan	I wish I had that job
2016-03-14 23:31:05	@Espyo	so would I
2016-03-14 23:31:13	@Espyo	not do a thing all day and get rich? yes please
2016-03-14 23:31:30	@Espyo	Treehouse is just being stupid and lazy all the time now
2016-03-14 23:31:43	@Espyo	localizations are lazy and, again, appeal to the lowest common denominator
2016-03-14 23:31:47	@PikFan	again, I thought it was funny
2016-03-14 23:31:47	@Espyo	comedy? nah, that's too hard
2016-03-14 23:31:53	@Espyo	just type a le ebig maymay xdddd
2016-03-14 23:32:08	@Espyo	but they can write funny things WITHOUT using lazy memes
2016-03-14 23:32:10	@PikFan	because I've always seen Nintendo as rigid
2016-03-14 23:32:17	@Espyo	yeah, I get that
2016-03-14 23:32:19	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-03-14 23:32:27	@Espyo	but memes are so overdone and bland
2016-03-14 23:32:32	@Espyo	you just follow a formula
2016-03-14 23:32:33	@PikFan	I really do not see the harm in it
2016-03-14 23:32:40	@Espyo	if you spin it around with some originality, it can get some laughs
2016-03-14 23:32:47	@PikFan	probably because I'm a teenager, and teenagers are stupid
2016-03-14 23:32:49	@Espyo	since people have to think a bit to get the funny meaning in it
2016-03-14 23:32:57	@Espyo	but just slapping the meme as-is is just ugh
2016-03-14 23:33:06	@Espyo	heh, I guess it could be
2016-03-14 23:33:13	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-14 23:33:15	@Espyo	but again, they could appeal to so many more people if they actually tried a bit
2016-03-14 23:33:35	@PikFan	this one girl at school said that if you have to explain a joke to someone, it's not funny
2016-03-14 23:33:43	@PikFan	...but that's not what you're saying, is it?
2016-03-14 23:33:53	@Espyo	it's not

2016-03-14 23:33:59	@Espyo	jokes are hard
2016-03-14 23:34:12	@Espyo	but part of what makes a good joke is having the listener have to think a tiny bit to get the meaning out of it
2016-03-14 23:34:24	@Espyo	if I just say "dickbutt", it's not funny
2016-03-14 23:34:30	@Espyo	there's no setup, no thought involved, no nothing
2016-03-14 23:34:45	@Espyo	I guess the absurdity of it just being there although it really shouldn't IS kinda funny in its own right
2016-03-14 23:34:45	@PikFan	what do cows drink?
2016-03-14 23:34:49	@Espyo	but wow

2016-03-14 23:35:35	@PikFan	laughing not at the joke, but rather my admitting it was bad
2016-03-14 23:35:49	@Espyo	I didn't even see a joke lol
2016-03-14 23:35:58	@PikFan	oh
2016-03-14 23:36:04	@PikFan	well, it's better done verbally
2016-03-14 23:36:24	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-14 23:36:38	@PikFan	if you ask someone what cows drink, they'll want to say milk because cows make milk
2016-03-14 23:36:48	@PikFan	but then they'll realize that's not right
2016-03-14 23:36:51	@Espyo	oh yeah heh
2016-03-14 23:36:54	@Espyo	right, I DID think of that
2016-03-14 23:37:01	@Espyo	but I was like "he wants me to say milk. nope"
2016-03-14 23:37:12	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-03-14 23:37:19	@Espyo	anti-comedy?
2016-03-14 23:37:22	@Espyo	that's a form of comedy
2016-03-14 23:37:31	@PikFan	anti-comedy?
2016-03-14 23:37:39	@Espyo	in a way, I think that was anti-comedy, yeah
2016-03-14 23:37:51	@Espyo	[[wikipedia:Anti-comedy]] (if this works, I'll be surprised)
2016-03-14 23:37:51	Testyo	"wikipedia:Anti-comedy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=wikipedia:Anti-comedy
2016-03-14 23:37:58	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-03-14 23:38:00	@Espyo	that is SO hacky
2016-03-14 23:38:09	@PikFan	WOW
2016-03-14 23:38:18	@Espyo	I love it
2016-03-14 23:38:22	@PikFan	...how
2016-03-14 23:38:24	@Espyo	anyway yeah, anti-humor
2016-03-14 23:38:28	@Espyo	because we have a wikipedia: prefix
2016-03-14 23:38:30	@Espyo	and
2016-03-14 23:38:34	@Espyo	I guess it also applies in URLs
2016-03-14 23:38:42	@PikFan	neat
2016-03-14 23:38:45	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-14 23:39:01	@Espyo	anyway yeah, having Nintendo, who's so strict, writing something SO absurd like a dumb meme
2016-03-14 23:39:03	@Espyo	that's funny
2016-03-14 23:39:12	@Espyo	but... they've been writing memes for years now
2016-03-14 23:39:20	@Espyo	it stopped being absurd, now it's just lazy
2016-03-14 23:39:23	@Espyo	plus, it's CRINGY as hell
2016-03-14 23:39:25	@Espyo	it's like
2016-03-14 23:39:42	@Espyo	you know those commercials obviously made by the big guys in suits, that try to appeal to the kids?
2016-03-14 23:39:56	@Espyo	yo, check out this totally tubular new skateboard, bros and broettes!
2016-03-14 23:40:02	@Espyo	and everybody just cringes
2016-03-14 23:40:06	@Espyo	that's Nintendo right now
2016-03-14 23:41:33	@PikFan	but anyway, about Callie's slang
2016-03-14 23:41:33	@PikFan	I feel like people are being too serious about it
2016-03-14 23:41:34	@PikFan	...holy crap
2016-03-14 23:41:34	@PikFan	that wall of text appeared all at once
2016-03-14 23:41:51	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-03-14 23:42:00	@Espyo	yeah, they are
2016-03-14 23:42:06	@Espyo	but on the other hand, it really is as simple as that
2016-03-14 23:42:16	@Espyo	Nintendo Treehouse is paying some people to localize some simple messages
2016-03-14 23:42:26	@Espyo	and they just do such a lazy job
2016-03-14 23:42:33	@Espyo	they'd be fired in any sensible company
2016-03-14 23:42:51	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-14 23:43:25	@Espyo	"what are the kids into these days? "may...mays"? all right, make millions of them"

2016-03-14 23:45:22	@PikFan	hopefully it's better now
2016-03-14 23:45:25	@PikFan	anyway
2016-03-14 23:47:18	@PikFan	the way I see it, it's meant to be a lighthearted thing, and if people get upset about it, then I guess they hate a lot of things
2016-03-14 23:47:24	@PikFan	is it original? nope
2016-03-14 23:47:31	@PikFan	is it overused? yep
2016-03-14 23:47:42	@PikFan	and that's why I like it
2016-03-14 23:47:55	@PikFan	I'm not saying I don't like original things; I do
2016-03-14 23:48:12	@PikFan	but I think it's also funny when they use things that are overused
2016-03-14 23:48:21	@PikFan	kinda going back to the anti-humor thing
2016-03-14 23:48:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-14 23:49:09	@PikFan	but I can agree with you about the laziness
2016-03-14 23:49:33	@Espyo	there's a bit of a cognitive dissonance for me
2016-03-14 23:49:40	@Espyo	on one hand, I want to complain, because I hate unfairness
2016-03-14 23:49:49	@Espyo	I hate how there're so many talented comedy writers out there out of a job
2016-03-14 23:50:04	@PikFan	also, considering this is only my third Splatfest, this is the first time it's really meme-y for me
2016-03-14 23:50:08	@Espyo	while "random guy from the internet #5523742" writes a half-assed meme and Nintendo gives it the green checkmark
2016-03-14 23:50:23	@Espyo	on the other hand, I don't want to be grouchy and hate stuff, nor do I want to waste my time with small things like this
2016-03-14 23:50:33	@PikFan	right
2016-03-14 23:50:40	@Espyo	other Splatfests weren't that memey
2016-03-14 23:50:42	@Espyo	that I can remember, at least
2016-03-14 23:50:46	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-14 23:50:46	@Espyo	oh, btw, all of this is for the US only
2016-03-14 23:50:50	@Espyo	Europe never gets dank memes
2016-03-14 23:50:54	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2016-03-14 23:50:58	@PikFan	heh, really?
2016-03-14 23:51:02	@Espyo	references, sure
2016-03-14 23:51:04	@Espyo	every once in a whie
2016-03-14 23:51:06	@Espyo	*while
2016-03-14 23:51:08	@PikFan	I guess NoA is the most lighthearted of the bunch
2016-03-14 23:51:09	@Espyo	references to other games
2016-03-14 23:51:14	@Espyo	.........sometimes references to movies
2016-03-14 23:51:19	@Espyo	Fire Emblem Awakening has a reference to Taken
2016-03-14 23:51:35	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-14 23:51:40	@Espyo	but other than that, no NoE localization of anything really has memes
2016-03-14 23:51:49	@Espyo	Japan probably doesn't even know what memes are
2016-03-14 23:52:09	@PikFan	that, or their memes are completely different from Western culture
2016-03-14 23:52:53	@Espyo	yeah

2016-03-14 23:55:47	@PikFan	but yeah, I also feel like if people are getting this upset over such a tiny thing, then it must've happened before
2016-03-14 23:55:47	@PikFan	because at some point, I'd get upset too, if they were always using memes and slang
2016-03-14 23:55:47	@PikFan	but this is my first time, so I thought it was funny

2016-03-15 15:22:06	Bulborbs_At_View	Okay, so I've been working on a Pikmin forum game in the past few days, and I'm not sure about where to post about it. Feels like it should go in Tech, but that seems a bit out of place. It's also on a forum I created so I don't know if any advertising rules would get broken...
2016-03-15 15:29:13	Klemen702	i think it goes on the off-topic thing
2016-03-15 15:29:35	Klemen702	it's not like the descriptions are always right
2016-03-15 15:29:56	Klemen702	and if someone complains you can deal with them easily
2016-03-15 15:48:46	Bulborbs_At_View	What do you mean by that? The "dealing with them" part, I mean
2016-03-15 15:50:34	Klemen702	if they say you posted it on the wrong forum
2016-03-15 15:50:40	Klemen702	just say that you didn't know where to post
2016-03-15 15:50:50	Klemen702	and ask them where to do it next time
2016-03-15 15:53:28	Bulborbs_At_View	Ah, indeed. Fair enough

2016-03-15 19:21:28	Yoshi2	if you have something to talk about, you can write it in the channel
2016-03-15 19:22:00	Yoshi2	mibbit shows everybody as idle when you join a channel
2016-03-15 19:22:18	NiteWingerL	oh yeh

2016-03-15 19:25:55	Yoshi2	I think the idle feature in mibbit is misleading because it gives the impression that a channel is dead

2016-03-15 21:57:57	Bulborbs_At_View	Ah neat
2016-03-15 22:31:22	Klemen702	can someone explain to how i can literally forget something i was planning to do 5 sec ago
2016-03-15 22:31:48	Klemen702	it's really annoying yet it happens so often x=P
2016-03-15 22:31:48	@Espyo	because brains

2016-03-15 22:38:27	Bulborbs_At_View	"Ya see this thing? *points at brain* SCREW THIS THING"
2016-03-15 22:39:49	Klemen702	that's actually pretty accurate
2016-03-15 22:39:58	Klemen702	the brain has lost some of it's screws
2016-03-15 22:40:05	Klemen702	so there are leaks here and there
2016-03-15 22:40:16	Klemen702	which your memory goes through
2016-03-15 22:40:26	Klemen702	so screwing it would be a good decision

2016-03-15 22:57:21	Bulborbs_At_View	What's new in that update?
2016-03-15 22:59:28	@Espyo	it's a long list
2016-03-15 22:59:32	@Espyo	can't remember it all off the top of my head
2016-03-15 22:59:36	@Espyo	but the main thing is carrying paths
2016-03-15 22:59:44	@Espyo	Pikmin no longer carry stuff to the Onions and ship in a straight line
2016-03-15 23:05:54	Bulborbs_At_View	Is it all that stuff in the roadmap?
2016-03-15 23:06:07	@Espyo	no way
2016-03-15 23:06:12	@Espyo	there's still so much more to do
2016-03-15 23:06:16	@Espyo	wait, depends
2016-03-15 23:06:18	@Espyo	what roadmap?
2016-03-15 23:06:30	Bulborbs_At_View	The one on the fanon wiki
2016-03-15 23:06:36	Bulborbs_At_View	And yeah it looks like a LOT of stuff
2016-03-15 23:06:50	@Espyo	can you give me the link?
2016-03-15 23:06:57	@Espyo	I know I linked to something somewhere, but I can't remember what it is
2016-03-15 23:07:00	@Espyo	could be outdatd
2016-03-15 23:07:02	@Espyo	*outdated

2016-03-15 23:07:21	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-15 23:07:28	@Espyo	I linked to an actual detailed list somewhere
2016-03-15 23:07:31	@Espyo	but I don't know where
2016-03-15 23:07:55	@Espyo	anyway, from that list, the only things that get added in this update are the carrying paths
2016-03-15 23:11:01	Bulborbs_At_View	You don't remember any of the other changes?
2016-03-15 23:11:21	@Espyo	well, there's the carrying paths and improved wall physics
2016-03-15 23:11:29	@Espyo	there's a lot of other ones, but they're so small
2016-03-15 23:11:35	@Espyo	and I've been developing this version for like 4 months now
2016-03-15 23:11:38	@Espyo	I'll check the list
2016-03-15 23:15:07	@Espyo	created some debugging tools for area/enemy/Pikmin/etc. creators
2016-03-15 23:15:15	@Espyo	F12 takes a screenshot
2016-03-15 23:15:18	@Espyo	implemented bottomless pits
2016-03-15 23:15:38	@Espyo	editors ask you if you want to quit without saving
2016-03-15 23:15:46	@Espyo	got better treasures
2016-03-15 23:15:58	@Espyo	the position of HUD items can be customized
2016-03-15 23:16:03	@Espyo	the camera is smoother and nicer
2016-03-15 23:16:14	@Espyo	more game parameters are now configurable
2016-03-15 23:16:22	@Espyo	mouse controls have their own graphics

2016-03-15 23:18:43	Testyo	l beat stage two or three buttons can send a commit
2016-03-15 23:18:48	@Espyo	he is
2016-03-15 23:19:33	@PikFan	that's pretty neat
2016-03-15 23:22:33	@Espyo	it's amazing how one tiny change in the way the camera works makes a massive difference
2016-03-15 23:22:48	@Espyo	the camera already transitions smoothly between zoom levels and between leaders
2016-03-15 23:22:54	@Espyo	but following the leaders is super rigid
2016-03-15 23:22:58	@Espyo	it moves just as fast as they do
2016-03-15 23:23:03	@Espyo	like it's glued to them
2016-03-15 23:23:08	@Espyo	I made it lag slightly behind
2016-03-15 23:23:11	@Espyo	took 10 minutes to make at most
2016-03-15 23:23:13	@Espyo	and wow
2016-03-15 23:23:26	@Espyo	it doesn't feel like a Game Maker game made in half an hour
2016-03-15 23:23:33	@Espyo	it feels so much more professional and nicer
2016-03-15 23:26:48	@PikFan	awesome
2016-03-15 23:27:10	@PikFan	oh, speaking of Game Maker, this one girl at my school hopes to make a Zelda game using Game Maker
2016-03-15 23:27:17	@PikFan	my thoughts? there's no way
2016-03-15 23:27:23	@PikFan	she can barely use a computer
2016-03-15 23:27:33	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-15 23:27:38	@PikFan	of course, I didn't tell her that
2016-03-15 23:27:43	@Espyo	a few incredible games were made in Game Maker
2016-03-15 23:27:46	@PikFan	but there's like no way
2016-03-15 23:28:00	@Espyo	Iji, Hotline Miami, (I think) Dustforce
2016-03-15 23:28:03	@PikFan	I mean, if she's determined enough, then maybe, but I really doubt it
2016-03-15 23:28:12	@Espyo	but yeah, determination for sure
2016-03-15 23:28:18	Testyo	but yeah, like a do-it-yourself binary data dump
2016-03-15 23:28:30	@Espyo	but yeah, what he said
2016-03-15 23:28:31	@PikFan	what
2016-03-15 23:28:32	@Espyo	wait what
2016-03-15 23:28:37	@Espyo	that's one hell of a coincidence
2016-03-15 23:28:38	@Espyo	Testyo: lm
2016-03-15 23:28:38	@PikFan	LOL
2016-03-15 23:28:38	Testyo	I said but yeah, like a do-it-yourself binary data dump because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages but yeah, looks nice and but this format looks a lot like a do-it-yourself binary data dump.
2016-03-15 23:28:52	@Espyo	do I really say "but yeah," THAT much?
2016-03-15 23:28:54	@Espyo	come now, Testyo
2016-03-15 23:28:55	Testyo	no, even recent versions have no idea how Python's inner things work
2016-03-15 23:29:04	@PikFan	Testyo record but yeah
2016-03-15 23:29:05	Testyo	I have no record on the nickname but yeah.
2016-03-15 23:29:08	@Espyo	THAT sounds like something I'd say
2016-03-15 23:29:13	@PikFan	Testyo track but yeah
2016-03-15 23:29:14	Testyo	should I don't think I'll have time to check it in detail today
2016-03-15 23:29:51	@Espyo	Testyo: save moment but yeah, determination 2
2016-03-15 23:29:51	@PikFan	Testyo help
2016-03-15 23:29:51	Testyo	Done. I saved this 2 line moment, from <Espyo> but yeah, determination for sure to <Testyo> but yeah, like a do-it-yourself binary .... (Moment #23)

2016-03-16 20:34:24	@Espyo	Scruffy: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Music&curid=8776&diff=160513&oldid=152221 I don't get this message
2016-03-16 20:35:48	Klemen702	hey scruffalord
2016-03-16 20:35:49	Scruffy	Oh, so on the Pikmin 2 music article there are audio files of all the short transitions in the boss theme
2016-03-16 20:36:14	Scruffy	I couldn't do the same for Pikmin 3's boss themes because I have no recordings of it and can't find them
2016-03-16 20:36:21	Scruffy	Hi Klemen702!
2016-03-16 20:36:22	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-16 20:36:54	Scruffy	But I actually realized this morning that you have them in the Pikmin 3 game files, if in a weird format
2016-03-16 20:37:04	Scruffy	Or, I assume you do
2016-03-16 20:38:59	Scruffy	There are a lot of them, for minibosses and the main bosses
2016-03-16 20:39:06	Scruffy	None for the Plasm Wraith though
2016-03-16 20:39:30	@Espyo	there's direct access to stream music
2016-03-16 20:39:48	@Espyo	but the boss themes and some other songs are sequenced
2016-03-16 20:40:19	Scruffy	Sequenced?
2016-03-16 20:41:12	Scruffy	You mean... not looping?
2016-03-16 20:41:58	Yoshi2	Espyo: what's the difference between sequenced and stream music?
2016-03-16 20:42:58	En_Passant	This is a total guess, but does it have anything to do with when the notes are chosen?
2016-03-16 20:43:33	Yoshi2	En_Passant: pikmin 3 doesn't use that midi-like format from pikmin 2 though
2016-03-16 20:43:43	Yoshi2	iirc
2016-03-16 20:43:52	@Espyo	stream: MP3
2016-03-16 20:43:53	@Espyo	sequenced: MIDI
2016-03-16 20:43:55	@Espyo	:P
2016-03-16 20:44:11	Yoshi2	I see
2016-03-16 20:44:24	Yoshi2	regular midi or special format?
2016-03-16 20:44:27	@Espyo	let me double check though
2016-03-16 20:44:30	@Espyo	special format, I'm afraid
2016-03-16 20:44:54	Yoshi2	I thought pikmin 3 didn't use special sequenced formats 
2016-03-16 20:45:04	Yoshi2	was I lied to? D:
2016-03-16 20:45:26	@Espyo	yeah, that's pretty much it
2016-03-16 20:45:31	@Espyo	Pikmin 2/3 boss themes are sequenced
2016-03-16 20:45:33	@Espyo	there might be more
2016-03-16 20:45:43	@Espyo	here's the thing
2016-03-16 20:45:47	@Espyo	they're not on the stream folder
2016-03-16 20:45:56	@Espyo	so they can only be saved as sequenced music
2016-03-16 20:46:12	@Espyo	there are 3 audio files that aren't streamed music
2016-03-16 20:46:19	@Espyo	 1 MB, 10 MB, 62 MB
2016-03-16 20:46:26	Klemen702	brb
2016-03-16 20:46:29	@Espyo	the 62 MB one might be sound effects
2016-03-16 20:46:40	@Espyo	GROUP_STATIC.bfgrp (62 MB)
2016-03-16 20:46:51	@Espyo	GROUP_MAPE.bfgrp (10 MB)
2016-03-16 20:46:57	Scruffy	That first could be Pikmin singing along with the area theme

2016-03-16 20:47:11	@Espyo	maybe
2016-03-16 20:47:21	Yoshi2	hmm, isn't the singing part of the streamed files?
2016-03-16 20:47:21	En_Passant	They do that?
2016-03-16 20:47:33	@Espyo	I don't think it is, no
2016-03-16 20:47:37	Yoshi2	or am I thinking of something else
2016-03-16 20:47:39	Scruffy	When you leave a group of Pikmin idle, yea

2016-03-16 23:06:46	@Espyo	you can have them both speaking their native language to one another

2016-03-16 23:14:23	@PikFan	hold on, dumb moment here
2016-03-16 23:14:28	@PikFan	what's a card?
2016-03-16 23:14:39	@Espyo	the graphics card is one of your computer's components
2016-03-16 23:14:39	@PikFan	because I've heard of graphics cards, audio cards, et
2016-03-16 23:14:40	@PikFan	*etc
2016-03-16 23:14:47	@Espyo	like the memory, network card, disk, etc.
2016-03-16 23:15:02	@Espyo	the graphics card is just like a CPU, but is more specialized towards doing graphics operations
2016-03-16 23:15:12	@Espyo	so when you're drawing graphics, you tell the graphics card to do the hard work
2016-03-16 23:15:27	@Espyo	really cheap machines don't even have a graphics card, so your normal CPU does the work
2016-03-16 23:15:39	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-16 23:16:08	@Espyo	I REALLY want to start downloading stuff into this and testing stuff out
2016-03-16 23:16:32	@PikFan	but 17,000 fps, dang
2016-03-16 23:16:36	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-16 23:16:40	@Espyo	but like I said, it might be normal for this program
2016-03-16 23:16:49	@PikFan	your graphics card is a beast
2016-03-16 23:16:59	@PikFan	how much was it?
2016-03-16 23:17:01	@Espyo	seems that way
2016-03-16 23:17:05	@Espyo	the whole laptop was 1000€
2016-03-16 23:17:06	Testyo	1000 € = £ 706.6  / $ 1087.2 
2016-03-16 23:17:18	@PikFan	jeez
2016-03-16 23:17:41	@Espyo	I really wanted to invest on a good computer so I wouldn't have to worry ever again
2016-03-16 23:17:45	@Espyo	this one is already showing its age
2016-03-16 23:17:49	@Espyo	not like it was ever fast to begin with
2016-03-16 23:17:54	@Espyo	but nowadays it drags to do the simples things
2016-03-16 23:17:55	@Espyo	*simplest
2016-03-16 23:18:00	@Espyo	plus it's starting to glitch out like crazy

2016-03-16 23:18:13	@Espyo	download the engine

2016-03-17 18:52:49	Chiaki_Nanami	there's no 100% TAS
2016-03-17 18:54:14	@Espyo	not yet?
2016-03-17 18:54:15	@Espyo	youch
2016-03-17 18:54:23	Chiaki_Nanami	no, not really
2016-03-17 18:54:43	Chiaki_Nanami	there is one in the making but it's unfortunately using very old routes
2016-03-17 19:00:38	@Espyo	yeah, that always sucks
2016-03-17 19:00:42	@Espyo	it's no wonder it never gets made
2016-03-17 19:00:46	@Espyo	people keep discovering tricks and routes
2016-03-17 19:00:53	@Espyo	and restarting a TAS isn't really something you just DO
2016-03-17 19:01:13	@Espyo	plus emulator improvements as time goes by and all
2016-03-17 19:01:42	Chiaki_Nanami	precisely
2016-03-17 19:02:05	Chiaki_Nanami	and it's a long game
2016-03-17 19:02:10	Chiaki_Nanami	there's a lot to do
2016-03-17 19:02:13	@Espyo	yeah, specially for 100%
2016-03-17 19:02:33	Chiaki_Nanami	the SM64 120star TAS took a year or so and it was a collaboration between 10+ people
2016-03-17 19:04:06	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-17 19:05:34	Chiaki_Nanami	and I'd bet parts of that are outdated now as new techniques are being found almost daily
2016-03-17 19:05:58	@Espyo	pancake is a beast at it
2016-03-17 19:06:10	@Espyo	so it's no wonder there are new strats at least once a month

2016-03-17 19:38:10	@PikFan	hey, Espyo
2016-03-17 19:38:39	@PikFan	for Splatfest, how can you figure out which team will be the less popular one?
2016-03-17 19:39:08	@Espyo	just guessing, I guess
2016-03-17 19:39:29	@PikFan	last night I tried looking for online polls
2016-03-17 19:39:32	@Espyo	think about how most of the player are little kids
2016-03-17 19:39:39	@Espyo	and they'll just go for the most super-duper choice
2016-03-17 19:39:42	@PikFan	...most?
2016-03-17 19:39:58	@PikFan	there's no way that most of the users are little kids
2016-03-17 19:40:38	@PikFan	then again, there are hardly any demographics for any video game
2016-03-17 19:40:50	Chiaki_Nanami	no way lol
2016-03-17 19:41:07	Chiaki_Nanami	there are loads of old Nintendo fans who got a Wii U just for Splatoon because it's a genuinely good game
2016-03-17 19:41:08	@Espyo	how long have you been playing for?
2016-03-17 19:41:11	@Espyo	I can safely say most are TODDLERS
2016-03-17 19:41:13	@PikFan	I've been seeing lots of users say "oh the kids will pick Snowmen, so I'm going with Sandcastles"
2016-03-17 19:41:28	@PikFan	TODDLERS?!
2016-03-17 19:41:32	@PikFan	wha...
2016-03-17 19:41:42	Chiaki_Nanami	toddlers play mobile games lol
2016-03-17 19:41:47	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-03-17 19:41:57	@PikFan	but I don't expect a toddler to be able to play Splatoon
2016-03-17 19:42:08	@PikFan	unless they're some kind of child prodigy
2016-03-17 19:42:16	Chiaki_Nanami	they go on the AppStore and get whatever microtransaction-heavy game that is popular at the time and play that for 2 hours until they get a new one
2016-03-17 19:42:31	@PikFan	lol yeah
2016-03-17 19:42:42	Chiaki_Nanami	2 hours is a bit optimistic, actually
2016-03-17 19:42:47	Chiaki_Nanami	say about 45 minutes
2016-03-17 19:42:53	@PikFan	okay, this is all besides the point
2016-03-17 19:43:09	Chiaki_Nanami	until their attention span run out and they whine to their parents about not having enough fun
2016-03-17 19:43:19	@PikFan	so, I've actually been recording miiverse posts
2016-03-17 19:43:35	@Espyo	toddlers don't have the critical thinking skills to work with other people, be aware of their surroundings, or come up with a plan, they don't have the memory or mind flexibility to know basic game rules, and they lack the motor skills to pull off simple in-game movement
2016-03-17 19:43:41	@Espyo	so YEP, most of the players on Splatoon
2016-03-17 19:43:45	@PikFan	I still don't think I have enough yet to be considered an accurate representation of the whole community
2016-03-17 19:43:48	@Espyo	at least the ones on my teams
2016-03-17 19:44:25	@PikFan	that, or they're intentionally playing bad to piss you off, or something
2016-03-17 19:44:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-17 19:44:41	Chiaki_Nanami	those should not be allowed to exist
2016-03-17 19:44:45	@PikFan	^
2016-03-17 19:44:51	Chiaki_Nanami	it's a team-based game
2016-03-17 19:45:05	@PikFan	wait so
2016-03-17 19:45:10	@PikFan	you have Splatoon?
2016-03-17 19:45:14	Chiaki_Nanami	no lol
2016-03-17 19:45:17	Chiaki_Nanami	I just know a lot about the game
2016-03-17 19:45:24	Chiaki_Nanami	multiplayer is not my thing
2016-03-17 19:45:25	@PikFan	you should get it
2016-03-17 19:45:27	@PikFan	oh
2016-03-17 19:46:09	@PikFan	I need to analyze my data soon
2016-03-17 19:46:23	@PikFan	Splatfest starts tomorrow night, so I don't have much time left
2016-03-17 19:46:25	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-03-17 19:46:34	@PikFan	can you pick a team DURING Splatfest?
2016-03-17 19:48:33	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-17 19:49:32	@PikFan	oh, good
2016-03-17 19:50:01	@PikFan	in that case, I'll use my alt save and play a bit and figure out which team has the better players
2016-03-17 19:50:53	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-17 19:51:04	@Espyo	you might be overthinking this
2016-03-17 19:51:15	@PikFan	Espyo
2016-03-17 19:51:22	@PikFan	I overthink lots of things

2016-03-17 19:56:57	@Espyo	yeah, it'll be moved to like Saturday
2016-03-17 19:57:06	@Espyo	I'd prefer sand in my pants
2016-03-17 19:57:13	@Espyo	since I can always take off the pants and shake them about
2016-03-17 19:57:15	@Espyo	but snow?
2016-03-17 19:57:16	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-17 19:57:21	@Espyo	yeah, I don't really like frozen SKIN
2016-03-17 19:57:31	Yoshi2	wet skin
2016-03-17 19:57:33	@PikFan	wait, what'll be moved to Saturday
2016-03-17 19:57:40	Yoshi2	because the snow will probably melt

2016-03-17 20:12:21	@Espyo	sure
2016-03-17 20:15:19	Klemen702	prefer over what?
2016-03-17 20:15:25	Klemen702	i am really interested for no reason
2016-03-17 20:16:01	@PikFan	snow
2016-03-17 20:16:16	Klemen702	snow in his pants or snowing outside
2016-03-17 20:16:24	@PikFan	the former
2016-03-17 20:16:31	Klemen702	in his pants?
2016-03-17 20:16:35	@PikFan	yes
2016-03-17 20:16:53	Klemen702	i have a slight feeling sand in pants could be deadlier
2016-03-17 20:16:53	@PikFan	he would rather have sand in his pants than snow in his pants
2016-03-17 20:17:00	@PikFan	...lol

2016-03-17 20:20:59	@Espyo	J: is there a specific name for the terminal thing you enter when you do alt+shift+F1?
2016-03-17 20:22:29	@J	TTY maybe
2016-03-17 20:22:38	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-17 20:22:41	@J	also it's ctrl not shift
2016-03-17 20:22:51	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-03-17 20:22:52	@Espyo	ugh
2016-03-17 20:23:08	@Espyo	nope, doesn't really sound like it's TTY
2016-03-17 20:24:12	@J	it is, it just means different things
2016-03-17 20:24:18	@J	I can't think of any other name they have
2016-03-17 20:24:32	@Espyo	well crud
2016-03-17 20:24:36	@Espyo	really can't find any info
2016-03-17 20:24:45	@Espyo	my keyboard layout is set to US, but I managed to fix it

2016-03-17 20:27:54	@J	oh, okay
2016-03-17 20:28:08	@J	do you have /etc/vconsole.conf?
2016-03-17 20:28:29	@J	why are you using TTYs anyway?  There's generally not much need
2016-03-17 20:29:29	@Espyo	I'm not right now, but I could need it later
2016-03-17 20:29:32	@Espyo	to kill X, for instance
2016-03-17 20:29:35	@Espyo	yeah, it's pretty rare
2016-03-17 20:29:47	@Espyo	I'll try to find some solution real quick, but if I can't, it's not that big of a deal
2016-03-17 20:29:49	@J	well, that file is how I change it here
2016-03-17 20:29:58	@Espyo	I just rebooted, so I'll check that file when it's done
2016-03-17 20:30:01	@J	for reference, I place 'KEYMAP=dvorak-uk' into it
2016-03-17 20:30:08	@J	so I guess just KEYMAP=pt or something
2016-03-17 20:30:38	@J	you find the code from a filename in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/
2016-03-17 20:30:42	@J	eg. mine is /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/dvorak/dvorak-uk.map.gz
2016-03-17 20:30:48	@Espyo	no such file /etc/vconsole.conf
2016-03-17 20:30:58	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-17 20:31:01	@Espyo	luckily I already know my code
2016-03-17 20:31:03	@Espyo	just "pt"
2016-03-17 20:31:20	@Espyo	I changed uh... /etc/keyboard or something? to get it to work on the window manager
2016-03-17 20:32:05	@J	what distribution is this?
2016-03-17 20:32:28	@J	I thought the ones you were looking at would have a GUI for setting it in X
2016-03-17 20:33:11	@Espyo	Lubuntu 16
2016-03-17 20:33:19	@Espyo	it does, hidden away
2016-03-17 20:33:24	@Espyo	I only found out today
2016-03-17 20:33:48	@Espyo	I tried creating /etc/vconsole.conf, but no luck
2016-03-17 20:33:55	@Espyo	meh, it's not that important
2016-03-17 20:33:56	@Espyo	thanks anyway
2016-03-17 20:34:10	@Espyo	it'll be fun to search for obscure answers while I wait for Splatoon to find people and such
2016-03-17 20:34:20	@Espyo	I have my laptop on my lap most of the time while playing
2016-03-17 20:34:35	@Espyo	hey, here's something weird
2016-03-17 20:34:40	@Espyo	when I had to shrink down my windows partition
2016-03-17 20:34:43	@Espyo	with 900 GB
2016-03-17 20:34:54	@Espyo	it wouldn't let me shrink it down to any less than 400 something GB
2016-03-17 20:37:21	@J	using the installer?
2016-03-17 20:38:23	@Espyo	all "tutorials" I saw online recommended shrinking the partition on windows itself
2016-03-17 20:38:37	@Espyo	not so much tutorials as they were stackexchange posts
2016-03-17 20:38:47	@Espyo	good thing I don't really need THAT much space
2016-03-17 20:38:54	@Espyo	I'm only taking up like 100 GB on this laptop
2016-03-17 20:41:15	@J	if it was the installer, maybe it had an old version of parted
2016-03-17 20:41:27	@J	pretty sure gparted now can properly move NTFS data around to shrink it
2016-03-17 20:41:34	@Espyo	oh nice
2016-03-17 20:43:45	@J	I did have to resize within Windows once, but I forget why
2016-03-17 20:57:21	Klemen702	i have a random question
2016-03-17 20:57:36	Klemen702	1. what are those little pictures on tabs callled?
2016-03-17 20:57:44	Klemen702	like pikipedia's flower logo
2016-03-17 20:58:16	@Espyo	favicons

2016-03-17 20:59:13	Klemen702	but would it be possible to make the favicon change to whatever when someone makes a message?

2016-03-18 19:16:24	Klemen702	oh okie
2016-03-18 19:16:27	@Espyo	lol
2016-03-18 19:16:41	Klemen702	most things usually use left click
2016-03-18 19:16:43	@Espyo	hmm... now I'm not sure if I mention that on the tutorial
2016-03-18 19:16:47	@Espyo	other people might have the same problem
2016-03-18 19:16:52	@Espyo	[[f:Pikmin fangame engine]]
2016-03-18 19:16:52	Testyo	"Pikmin_fangame_engine" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_fangame_engine
2016-03-18 19:17:00	@Espyo	yeah, left click is used for selections and such
2016-03-18 19:17:10	@Espyo	other tools have the middle or right click drag the camera
2016-03-18 19:17:21	@Espyo	since I have no right-click menus, I used the right mouse button for panning
2016-03-18 19:18:07	Klemen702	there is a chance i'm one of those guys who skips every text on the article and just downloads
2016-03-18 19:18:27	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-18 19:18:28	@Espyo	can't blame you
2016-03-18 19:18:30	@Espyo	those tutorials are huge
2016-03-18 19:19:00	@Espyo	where could I add that info on the engine itself?
2016-03-18 19:19:13	@Espyo	(the fact that you can right-drag)
2016-03-18 19:21:13	Klemen702	hm
2016-03-18 19:21:25	Klemen702	i finally get to see
2016-03-18 19:21:28	Klemen702	what this test 2 object is
2016-03-18 19:21:35	Klemen702	i found it once while digging in 0.4
2016-03-18 19:21:59	@Espyo	oh heh
2016-03-18 19:22:04	@Espyo	uhm... it's a test treasure
2016-03-18 19:22:08	@Espyo	I don't think it has graphics
2016-03-18 19:22:12	@Espyo	if it does, it's the old toilet paper graphics
2016-03-18 19:22:20	@Espyo	I can't remember its detail
2016-03-18 19:22:31	Klemen702	wait
2016-03-18 19:22:34	Klemen702	the play button doesn't work?
2016-03-18 19:23:00	@Espyo	where?
2016-03-18 19:23:05	@Espyo	on the main menu?
2016-03-18 19:23:07	Klemen702	oh wait nvm
2016-03-18 19:23:11	Klemen702	it's the name of the area
2016-03-18 19:23:25	@Espyo	oh, right >_>
2016-03-18 19:23:28	@Espyo	is it working now then?
2016-03-18 19:23:32	Klemen702	ye
2016-03-18 19:23:39	@Espyo	what I like to hear
2016-03-18 19:23:39	Klemen702	no graphics for test 2
2016-03-18 19:23:51	Klemen702	but i can't move through it
2016-03-18 19:24:12	@Espyo	seems about right
2016-03-18 19:27:11	Klemen702	found a crash
2016-03-18 19:27:21	Klemen702	i changed a 10 pellet into a 5 pellet
2016-03-18 19:27:27	Klemen702	and when 5 pikmin were on it
2016-03-18 19:27:28	Klemen702	crashed
2016-03-18 19:27:36	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2016-03-18 19:27:41	Yoshi2	wow, I'm pretty pissed about how that one torrent I downloaded now permanently has 2 other seeders
2016-03-18 19:27:47	@Espyo	but the carrying in that version is so outdated and clunky
2016-03-18 19:27:50	@Espyo	that I'm not surprised
2016-03-18 19:27:58	@Espyo	wow, Yoshi2
2016-03-18 19:28:12	Yoshi2	where were they when I was first trying to download it? :/
2016-03-18 19:29:05	@Espyo	there's probably some law for what happened to you
2016-03-18 19:30:36	Yoshi2	quite likely
2016-03-18 19:33:29	@Espyo	the pros of compiling with most warnings enabled
2016-03-18 19:33:34	@Espyo	you catched problematic code
2016-03-18 19:33:36	@Espyo	the cons
2016-03-18 19:33:49	@Espyo	visual studio is brain-damaged, and for it, everything is a problem

2016-03-18 20:32:57	Yoshi2	rip
2016-03-18 20:33:24	Klemen702	i should make a counter on how many people i have seen on the internet that have strict parents

2016-03-18 20:33:34	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-18 20:33:41	Klemen702	either way barely any don't
2016-03-18 20:33:55	@PikFan	are your parents strict
2016-03-18 20:34:18	Klemen702	nop

2016-03-18 20:37:04	@PikFan	hahahah, very funny
2016-03-18 20:37:12	@PikFan	maybe I could get into the top 10,000
2016-03-18 20:37:17	@PikFan	definitely not the top 100
2016-03-18 20:37:34	Klemen702	the real question is
2016-03-18 20:37:38	Klemen702	how can someone ''ink his way''
2016-03-18 20:37:56	@PikFan	don't question Splatoon logic
2016-03-18 20:38:08	Klemen702	okie
2016-03-18 20:38:47	Yoshi2	I'll ink my way if you know what I mean
2016-03-18 20:39:04	Yoshi2	(as in painting my way with colors, ofc)
2016-03-18 20:40:06	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-03-18 20:40:14	@PikFan	I should analyze my poll
2016-03-18 20:40:32	@PikFan	but first, I'll have to get it into spreadsheets
2016-03-18 20:40:35	@PikFan	that'll be fun
2016-03-18 20:41:39	Klemen702	i object
2016-03-18 20:41:56	Klemen702	we need to be able to tell if you bought legal paint before you can ink your way
2016-03-18 20:42:28	Klemen702	too much illegal ink summons kidsquids
2016-03-18 20:44:12	Yoshi2	if a male squid and a female squid ink their way, the result is a kidsquid
2016-03-18 20:44:46	Klemen702	that's the illegal ink
2016-03-18 20:44:56	Klemen702	the legal ink cannot fuse with other ink
2016-03-18 20:45:05	Klemen702	(can i ask what the fuck am i saying)
2016-03-18 20:45:05	Testyo	You must be really upset if you're swearing. What can I do to help?

2016-03-18 21:03:18	@PikFan	so it turns out that Snowman has the higher average level, even though it's more popular

2016-03-18 21:11:21	@PikFan	both teams average to B- (which I turned into 4), but Sandcastles averages closer to B- than Snowmen
2016-03-18 21:11:39	@PikFan	so... I guess Sandcastles has the better players, given the higher rank?

2016-03-19 11:45:30	Yoshi2	every time you want to ask him about something, you forget what it was
2016-03-19 11:46:20	@Espyo	actually, it dates back to 1994, and was coined "The Espyo Question Law"
2016-03-19 11:46:33	@Espyo	 1994 since it was at that point that I began to actually be able to answer questions

2016-03-19 17:10:24	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-19 17:11:31	ScruffyChat	Seriously though, those are definitely tulips
2016-03-19 17:11:44	ScruffyChat	They have no leaves right under the inflorescence
2016-03-19 17:11:54	ScruffyChat	And rose leaves generally aren't that long
2016-03-19 17:11:54	@Espyo	oh, the things the Pikmin hide in
2016-03-19 17:11:56	@Espyo	definitely tulips

2016-03-19 17:12:25	ScruffyChat	But it's no big mistake or anything; roses can look a lot like tulips sometimes

2016-03-19 17:29:46	Klemen702	now i can actually make maps while knowing a bit how to make em
2016-03-19 17:29:56	@Espyo	since all you saw was a LOT of lines
2016-03-19 17:30:16	@Espyo	and it was hard to tell if a line was actually a wall, or a different sector, but still at ground level
2016-03-19 17:31:12	Klemen702	i think some actual working maps can be made now

2016-03-19 17:44:45	Klemen702	i typed .jpg and it works now :P
2016-03-19 17:44:46	@Espyo	those are png
2016-03-19 17:44:48	@Espyo	okay, nice
2016-03-19 17:45:17	@Espyo	Bridge and Leaf shadow are also .png
2016-03-19 17:45:20	@Espyo	but you shouldn't really be using those
2016-03-19 17:45:24	@Espyo	remember: you can add your own texture
2016-03-19 17:45:26	@Espyo	*textures
2016-03-19 17:45:34	@Espyo	just place them on the folder and it should work immediately
2016-03-19 17:45:52	Klemen702	i would if i would not be a MSpaint artist
2016-03-19 17:47:00	Klemen702	is there a way to remove the errors from the suggestions
2016-03-19 17:47:26	@Espyo	you can download textures off the internet
2016-03-19 17:47:29	@Espyo	I sure didn't make those ones either
2016-03-19 17:47:34	@Espyo	I got them from the Pikmin games
2016-03-19 17:47:40	@Espyo	(except for Test.png, duh)
2016-03-19 17:47:51	@Espyo	no, it'll stay there until you restart the editor
2016-03-19 17:48:04	@Espyo	but the list is sorted by the most recently used textures
2016-03-19 17:48:12	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-19 17:48:14	@Espyo	so after you use some more, it'll go lower and lower on the list
2016-03-19 17:48:15	@Espyo	don't worry about it
2016-03-19 17:59:40	Klemen702	now that you renamed the grass you will also have to edit the mention of the texture in your area creating guide
2016-03-19 18:01:24	@Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Topic:Pikmin_Engine_by_Espyo#Version_0.7 I mentioned it here
2016-03-19 18:01:35	@Espyo	it's only important for people that go from version 0.6 to 0.7
2016-03-19 18:01:42	Klemen702	ye
2016-03-19 18:01:45	@Espyo	people who start an area on 0.7 don't care if the texture changed
2016-03-19 18:01:50	Klemen702	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_fangame_engine/Creating_areas i'm talking about here
2016-03-19 18:02:01	Klemen702	so someone in the future who hasn't gotten 0.6 won't be confused
2016-03-19 18:02:03	@Espyo	I don't mention the old texture on that article
2016-03-19 18:02:04	@Espyo	...do I?

2016-03-19 18:48:02	Klemen702	well
2016-03-19 18:48:14	Klemen702	the dark green grass is supposed to fill the blackness

2016-03-19 18:48:29	Klemen702	is light green

2016-03-19 19:25:16	Bulborbs_At_View	Hello!
2016-03-19 19:32:16	Yoshi2	hiho Klemen702 & Bulborbs_At_View 
2016-03-19 19:33:07	Bulborbs_At_View	I finally decided to prematurely start Pikmin 3 instead of going through the rest of Pikmin 2, and I must say I don't regret the decision xP
2016-03-19 19:33:17	Bulborbs_At_View	(In my marathon of the series)
2016-03-19 19:35:04	Yoshi2	I finished pikmin 3 before I even started pikmin 2
2016-03-19 19:35:09	Yoshi2	and I haven't touched pikmin 1
2016-03-19 19:35:16	Bulborbs_At_View	And I've come to terms with the fact that Pikmin 2 might be my least favourite installment of the game. Those caves just pad out the game by far too much with too little substance, in my opinion. I enjoyed the days I spent entirely aboveground more than any of the days with cave spelunking.
2016-03-19 19:35:54	Bulborbs_At_View	Not to mention the game's utter delight in dropping things from the heavens in some of the latter dungeons. :V
2016-03-19 19:36:15	Klemen702	if i could give you my pikmin 1 copy i would
2016-03-19 19:36:22	Klemen702	i can't play it atm
2016-03-19 19:37:42	Bulborbs_At_View	Pikmin 1 is a close second favourite, but it definitely has a heavy case of first installment weirdness. The game has a fair few bad design choices (mainly those involving things that force you to wait, like unskippable cutscenes, pikmin drinking nectar, and the random tripping).
2016-03-19 19:38:17	Klemen702	are you american?
2016-03-19 19:38:18	Klemen702	if yes
2016-03-19 19:38:19	Klemen702	HAH
2016-03-19 19:38:24	Klemen702	we can skip the sunset cutscenes here
2016-03-19 19:38:28	Klemen702	take that
2016-03-19 19:38:35	Bulborbs_At_View	Canadian actually :P
2016-03-19 19:38:40	Klemen702	close enough
2016-03-19 19:38:49	Bulborbs_At_View	Do you have the Wii version?
2016-03-19 19:38:51	Klemen702	Canada is north USA according to USA
2016-03-19 19:38:54	Klemen702	nah gamecube
2016-03-19 19:38:58	Bulborbs_At_View	I'm mainly talking about the Gamecube one
2016-03-19 19:39:22	Klemen702	PAL gamecube can skip
2016-03-19 19:39:22	Bulborbs_At_View	Because the Wii port was neat in some aspects, but the control scheme was a bit weird, and I cannot stand those weird sounds they decided to give enemies.
2016-03-19 19:39:55	Bulborbs_At_View	I dunno if I just had a glitched version somehow, but they all just have these weird click-ish sounds. :|
2016-03-19 19:52:26	@J	the caves definitely have a very different feel to above ground areas
2016-03-19 19:52:52	@J	I quite like both, but I can certainly understand people who like one and not the other
2016-03-19 19:53:15	Klemen702	dungeons have always been my thing in games so i bet if i played the caves in pikmin i would like them
2016-03-19 19:53:22	@Espyo	J's words exactly
2016-03-19 19:53:32	@J	it's almost like they stretched out the main game with caves instead of having a much longer challenge mode
2016-03-19 20:24:20	Bulborbs_At_View	^ This
2016-03-19 20:28:23	Bulborbs_At_View	Pikmin 2's aboveground levels even feel slightly smaller than the Pikmin 1 areas, so without the caves it would be even shorter. But the caves aren't a good way to pad it out, for me. Especially not when more than 50% of the content seems to be underground.
2016-03-19 20:28:53	Yoshi2	50% of the content is underground?
2016-03-19 20:29:04	Yoshi2	suddenly I'm much less motivated to finish p2
2016-03-19 20:30:15	Bulborbs_At_View	I don't know the actual percentage but there's a LOT of the treasures underground.
2016-03-19 20:31:10	Bulborbs_At_View	There's more treasures in some caves than in the aboveground areas they're in.

2016-03-19 20:58:35	[Marty2000]	Do you all think it would be a good idea to make an article with the shells we can encounter in every Pikmin game?

2016-03-19 20:59:22	[Marty2000]	Or rests from the human civilization?

2016-03-19 20:59:35	@Espyo	maybe not an article for the shells

2016-03-19 21:01:23	[Marty2000]	I really like the Vegetation article and I thought it would be cool to make something for background decorations (such as shells or human rests)
2016-03-19 21:02:58	[Marty2000]	I think there would be plenty of things to add from Pikmin 3
2016-03-19 21:03:20	[Marty2000]	But this is minor information
2016-03-19 21:03:39	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-19 21:03:52	@Espyo	btw, sorry for not answering your question on my talk page
2016-03-19 21:03:55	@Espyo	I was busy the whole day
2016-03-19 21:04:04	@Espyo	you asked about adding the foreign names of plants, right?
2016-03-19 21:04:08	[Marty2000]	Oh, don't worry, that's okay
2016-03-19 21:04:12	[Marty2000]	Yep
2016-03-19 21:04:14	@Espyo	well, the foreign names only apply for canon names
2016-03-19 21:04:25	@Espyo	so names that Nintendo's localization teams gave
2016-03-19 21:04:36	[Marty2000]	Ok 
2016-03-19 21:04:36	@Espyo	for plants that have a name, like Clover, Horsetail, etc.
2016-03-19 21:04:40	@Espyo	those names exist in other languages, sure
2016-03-19 21:04:46	@Espyo	but those plants already have their articles
2016-03-19 21:04:49	@Espyo	so you can put the names on those articles
2016-03-19 21:04:58	@Espyo	for the background plants, those don't have an official name
2016-03-19 21:05:06	@Espyo	so they shouldn't have foreign names either
2016-03-19 21:05:16	[Marty2000]	Yes, i understand
2016-03-19 21:05:18	@Espyo	the names we give on the sections are just our guesses, but they're not official
2016-03-19 21:05:20	@Espyo	all right
2016-03-19 21:06:57	[Marty2000]	I just asked because sometimes, I know the names of some plants encountered in Pikmin 3 (although they have no official names) in my own language, but I can't find their Englsih names. There are plants I haven't uploaded because of that and I wondered if I should put "Unknown name" or a foreign name
2016-03-19 21:08:49	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-19 21:08:55	Klemen702	speaking of translations
2016-03-19 21:08:57	Klemen702	if anyone needs
2016-03-19 21:09:03	@Espyo	you could just put a name that explains what the plant looks like
2016-03-19 21:09:04	Klemen702	i have an Italian manual for pikmin 1
2016-03-19 21:09:13	@Espyo	and if some day in the future somebody knows the English name, they can add it
2016-03-19 21:09:21	[Marty2000]	Ok :-)
2016-03-19 21:09:23	@Espyo	Klemen702: sure, grab some names out of that and add them to the wiki
2016-03-19 21:09:28	@Espyo	btw, you asked some other things on my talk page that I never answered
2016-03-19 21:09:37	@Espyo	sorry, I was actually thinking about them to give an answer
2016-03-19 21:09:43	@Espyo	I'll come up with something real soon
2016-03-19 21:09:45	Klemen702	hm
2016-03-19 21:09:47	Klemen702	what do you need tho
2016-03-19 21:12:40	@Espyo	anything you can get your hands on, really
2016-03-19 21:12:45	@Espyo	enemy names, if you find them
2016-03-19 21:12:47	@Espyo	if not, mechanic names

2016-03-19 22:23:58	@Espyo	I guess you should try it on your user page first
2016-03-19 22:24:02	@Espyo	to see if it'll work well
2016-03-19 22:24:09	@Espyo	you can create a subpage for your user page

2016-03-19 22:46:35	[Marty2000]	By the way, could you see my message ("Leaders' throws preferences) ? I wanted to know if you and others thought whether this is a coincidence or a hidden secret...
2016-03-19 22:48:02	En_Passant	Seems to be intentional
2016-03-19 22:48:36	En_Passant	Hm. Actually, that's a lie. I have no idea
2016-03-19 22:48:46	En_Passant	From a coding standpoint, it could go either way
2016-03-19 22:50:30	[Marty2000]	It would possible to know who everybody prefers to throw, which would be great, but of course, it could simply be a coincidence...
2016-03-19 22:50:35	[Marty2000]	would be*
2016-03-19 22:51:07	En_Passant	I'll put it this way: The leaders probably do not have specifically coded preferences
2016-03-19 22:51:36	En_Passant	The game likely has a way of handling leader throws that happens to create preferences
2016-03-19 22:52:25	En_Passant	In the video, the priority order looks to be Alph > Brittany > Louie > Olimar/Charlie
2016-03-19 22:52:27	[Marty2000]	Yes, but I don't understand why, for example, Charlie can swap Brittany for Alph, but can't do the contrary
2016-03-19 22:52:47	En_Passant	So it will always choose Alph if he's available
2016-03-19 22:52:48	[Marty2000]	Yes
2016-03-19 22:53:03	[Marty2000]	Maybe it's only a question of priority
2016-03-19 22:54:11	En_Passant	If I had to WMG, I'd say that it handles leaders based on their proximity to the player
2016-03-19 22:54:46	En_Passant	If there's a tie (when the other leader stands right next to the player), then it selects based on their internal ID
2016-03-19 22:55:19	@Espyo	I think it's a coincidence
2016-03-19 22:55:26	@Espyo	I think the game just favors Alph
2016-03-19 22:55:30	@Espyo	then Brittany
2016-03-19 22:55:33	@Espyo	Charlie, Louie, Olimar
2016-03-19 22:55:34	[Marty2000]	Yes, probably
2016-03-19 22:55:39	@Espyo	that's the way they're ordered internally
2016-03-19 22:55:51	@Espyo	if they wanted to do it on purpose, chances are everybody wouldn't gravitate towards Alph right away
2016-03-19 22:56:23	[Marty2000]	Ah, I didn't know they were specifically ordered internally

2016-03-20 12:03:38	@Espyo	I'm afraid you have to upload them one by one
2016-03-20 12:03:47	@Espyo	what I like to do is upload one image using [[Special:Upload]]

2016-03-20 12:03:56	@Espyo	and then when it finishes uploading, I just click "Back" on my browser
2016-03-20 12:04:06	@Espyo	and I can upload another one right away, since all the information of the previous one is still there
2016-03-20 12:04:19	@Espyo	oh, speaking of uploads
2016-03-20 12:04:23	Marty2000	Ok, thanks for responding.
2016-03-20 12:04:35	@Espyo	next time you upload, remember to choose which type of image it is on the box below the description
2016-03-20 12:04:44	@Espyo	if it's a screenshot, choose Video game screenshot
2016-03-20 12:04:48	@Espyo	if not, try to choose the best one
2016-03-20 12:04:53	@Espyo	if you can't decide, you can leave it blank
2016-03-20 12:05:00	Marty2000	Oh, okay. I'll remember :-)
2016-03-20 12:05:08	@Espyo	but at least for screenshots you should pick the right one
2016-03-20 12:05:09	@Espyo	okay, thanks
2016-03-20 12:15:09	Klemen702	can someone give me the double ' symbol

2016-03-20 12:16:35	Klemen702	thank you
2016-03-20 12:16:48	@Espyo	how weird that it doesn't have it
2016-03-20 12:17:18	Klemen702	just asked another friend before you replied
2016-03-20 12:17:23	Klemen702	he said to hold shift + 2
2016-03-20 12:17:32	Klemen702	i now feel like the biggest idiot
2016-03-20 12:18:14	@Espyo	lol
2016-03-20 12:18:35	Klemen702	i had this problem for like 7 months now
2016-03-20 12:18:44	Klemen702	in need of a "
2016-03-20 12:18:57	@Espyo	well, on the US layout, the quote symbol is on Shift + the key right above the right Shift and to the left of Enter
2016-03-20 12:19:02	@Espyo	so it's not always Shift + 2
2016-03-20 12:20:19	Klemen702	i think the problem with it was
2016-03-20 12:20:27	Klemen702	on the 2 button
2016-03-20 12:20:31	Klemen702	the symbol DOES appear
2016-03-20 12:20:33	Klemen702	but it's tilted
2016-03-20 12:20:37	Klemen702	" isn't tilted
2016-03-20 12:21:35	@Espyo	weird
2016-03-20 13:02:54	@Espyo	also Marty2000, when you upload images of real-world things
2016-03-20 13:03:02	@Espyo	add the URL of where you got the image from on the description
2016-03-20 13:03:25	@Espyo	we have to be careful with images that belong to somebody else, so having the original URL might help in the future
2016-03-20 13:05:44	Marty2000	Ok
2016-03-20 13:06:01	@Espyo	thanks
2016-03-20 13:06:14	Marty2000	But I already upload them using the "URL source feature". Shoudl I still put the uRl in the descrption ?
2016-03-20 13:06:19	Marty2000	URL*
2016-03-20 13:06:30	@Espyo	yeah, because the wiki doesn't save the URL
2016-03-20 13:06:36	Marty2000	Ah, ok
2016-03-20 13:08:44	Marty2000	Also... maybe it's a weird question, but is there a limit on the number of images we can put in an article? I think there's no limit but I prefer to ask
2016-03-20 13:09:45	@J	no hard limit, just only really put stuff relevant to the text
2016-03-20 13:09:56	@J	if there are a load of other generally relevant images, make a gallery at the bottom

2016-03-20 13:13:10	@Espyo	internet went out, sorry
2016-03-20 13:13:15	@Espyo	that's a good question
2016-03-20 13:13:19	@Espyo	there's no limit, but it kind of uses common sense
2016-03-20 13:13:30	@Espyo	like, you wouldn't want to read an article that has 3 images for every paragraph

2016-03-20 13:13:50	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2016-03-20 13:14:30	Marty2000	Yes. And the problem is that for my "Decoration" article on my user page, hmmm... I have probably more than 100 screenshots to upload
2016-03-20 13:14:46	Marty2000	That's why i asked
2016-03-20 13:14:54	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-20 13:14:57	@Espyo	that may be a bit overkill
2016-03-20 13:15:09	Marty2000	Yes
2016-03-20 13:15:26	Marty2000	Or I should make a montage for things that are similar
2016-03-20 13:15:36	@Espyo	montages are usually frowned upon
2016-03-20 13:15:44	@Espyo	we should try to keep the images original whenever possible
2016-03-20 13:15:48	@Espyo	I'd say...
2016-03-20 13:15:53	@Espyo	for now, just upload basic stuff
2016-03-20 13:16:07	@Espyo	if later we decide that there's potential in explaining in detail all of the decorative bits in the series
2016-03-20 13:16:11	@Espyo	we can think about adding more images then
2016-03-20 13:16:22	@Espyo	but for now, let's keep it simple
2016-03-20 13:16:40	Marty2000	Yes, sure. 
2016-03-20 13:21:48	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-20 13:21:56	@Espyo	hey Marty2000? when you made this edit http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bomb_rock&curid=275&diff=160578&oldid=159963
2016-03-20 13:22:04	Marty2000	Well then, I'll upload a few screenshots and if it's useless, you can remove
2016-03-20 13:22:07	@Espyo	you put it under the section of enemies that can EAT bomb-rocks
2016-03-20 13:22:07	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-03-20 13:22:08	@Espyo	is that right?
2016-03-20 13:22:20	@Espyo	I don't think Sheargrubs or Shearwigs eat bomb-rocks
2016-03-20 13:22:20	Marty2000	Yes
2016-03-20 13:22:24	@Espyo	they do?
2016-03-20 13:22:45	Marty2000	In the first Pikmin game, they eat the Pikmin even if they hold a bomb rock
2016-03-20 13:22:48	Marty2000	But not In Pikmin 3
2016-03-20 13:23:02	@Espyo	oh, I see

2016-03-20 20:18:22	Yoshi2	why is --copy-gc a thing 
2016-03-20 20:18:24	Yoshi2	" 	If extracting a GameCube disc image, don't extract the real files to '/files/...'. Instead create a copy of the source image and store it as 'game.iso'. If the source image is already in this format, try to create a hard link and copy only if it fails."
2016-03-20 20:18:43	Yoshi2	WHY would somebody want to do that
2016-03-20 20:21:56	@Espyo	wow, yeah
2016-03-20 21:08:58	Yoshi2	ok, I looked through the options and there doesn't seem to be a way to make GC images
2016-03-20 21:09:33	Yoshi2	but there must've been other people who tried to make GC images too
2016-03-20 21:15:06	Yoshi2	well, I guess it can't do that
2016-03-20 21:15:09	Yoshi2	quite a shame
2016-03-20 21:15:29	Yoshi2	gcr it is
2016-03-20 21:16:10	Yoshi2	iirc file replacement is more of a pain with j's tools, but I haven't tried it myself yet
2016-03-20 21:17:56	@Espyo	I think it's easier with J's tool
2016-03-20 21:18:06	@Espyo	really, the only problem is accidentally touching the title ba
2016-03-20 21:18:07	@Espyo	*r
2016-03-20 21:19:53	Yoshi2	with gcr, I already have the files on the hdd and just need to rebuild the image from the folder
2016-03-20 21:20:01	Yoshi2	how is it with j's tool?

2016-03-20 21:35:18	Yoshi2	hi scruffy
2016-03-20 21:35:31	ScruffyChat	only on for a minute
2016-03-20 21:35:35	ScruffyChat	But I have some science
2016-03-20 21:35:35	@Espyo	I have 10 Pikmin-related ISOs
2016-03-20 21:35:40	@Espyo	this'll take a while to pass to the new laptop...

2016-03-20 21:36:28	@J	I see lots of highlights
2016-03-20 21:36:29	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-20 21:36:36	@Espyo	how close do you have to be?
2016-03-20 21:36:41	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2016-03-20 21:36:42	@Espyo	because I keep seeing them pick up nodes at a distance
2016-03-20 21:37:02	ScruffyChat	Well this was in Bingo Battle
2016-03-20 21:37:12	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-20 21:37:26	@Espyo	stuff in Bingo Battle might just have a closer activation range in general
2016-03-20 21:37:34	@Espyo	because of lag
2016-03-20 21:37:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-20 21:38:11	Yoshi2	I currently have a setup where I enabled network sharing for my modding folder, so on my notebook I can replace files and I only have to rebuild the image from the folder on the desktop
2016-03-20 21:38:14	ScruffyChat	Other thing: buried items get glitchy when they're higher up than bomb explosions
2016-03-20 21:38:59	@J	ah
2016-03-20 21:39:15	@J	yeah, GCEdit doesn't have any scriptable interface
2016-03-20 21:39:47	@J	but you can use the Python library to make one if you want
2016-03-20 21:39:53	@J	I forget how easy it is
2016-03-20 21:40:02	ScruffyChat	I tried to unearth a Face Wrinkler that was in a bucket of sand in the sand castle Bingo Battle arena
2016-03-20 21:40:13	ScruffyChat	Using a bomb on the ground
2016-03-20 21:40:34	@J	https://github.com/ikn/python-modules/blob/master/gcutil.py
2016-03-20 21:40:50	ScruffyChat	And the bomb exploded, about half a second later the Face Wrinkler popped up a little out of the ground, without any effect whatsoever

2016-03-20 21:41:12	ScruffyChat	So that also means the unearthing effect of the bomb depends on distance

2016-03-20 22:39:51	Neocraftz1553	Hello Espyo, Testyo
2016-03-20 22:39:52	Testyo	see what applications I like more, and refreshing, was much too small
2016-03-20 22:55:22	Neocraftz1553	The new update for the fan engineis awsome
2016-03-20 22:55:23	Neocraftz1553	many things are now editable
2016-03-20 22:58:18	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-03-20 22:58:34	@Espyo	everybody seems to love it
2016-03-20 22:58:38	@Espyo	I'm so happy
2016-03-20 22:58:51	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-03-20 22:59:14	Neocraftz1553	The carrying paths really help to make it more like the canongames
2016-03-20 23:00:09	Neocraftz1553	I am going to make a video on it... again
2016-03-20 23:00:18	Neocraftz1553	 3 videos of the Engine once I upload this one
2016-03-20 23:01:55	@Espyo	nice
2016-03-20 23:05:15	Neocraftz1553	The new update makes me think of the Formidable Oak for some reason
2016-03-20 23:06:25	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-20 23:23:20	Neocraftz1553	just a thought, but, do you think you could make a simple go-here feature for the engine? like the captains follow the carrying paths and stop at the nearest stop/point 
2016-03-20 23:26:26	@Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_fangame_engine/Creating_areas#Carrying_paths
2016-03-20 23:26:35	@Espyo	>One final thought: you might be thinking "Why not make all paths one-way? They all lead to the Onions anyway." well, what if you decide you want to move your Onions or ship at some point? Plus, in future versions of the engine, there is a high chance that a mechanic similar to the "Go Here!" command from Pikmin 3 will be implemented and use these paths. Leaders can go from any spot to any other spot, so having two-way paths is important.
2016-03-20 23:26:42	@Espyo	so the answer to your question is maaaaaaaaybe ;)
2016-03-20 23:27:29	Neocraftz1553	sounds awsome
2016-03-20 23:27:46	Neocraftz1553	and yes, why not make all paths one way
2016-03-20 23:28:32	Neocraftz1553	I also liked the paths testing map of the engine
2016-03-20 23:28:37	Neocraftz1553	its like a production line
2016-03-20 23:29:31	Neocraftz1553	may I include that quote in my video?
2016-03-20 23:34:43	Neocraftz1553	oh and nectar
2016-03-20 23:34:43	Neocraftz1553	doesn't turn them into flowers
2016-03-20 23:35:09	Neocraftz1553	thats just a small thing, not very noticable if you don't use nectar
2016-03-20 23:37:53	@Espyo	sure
2016-03-20 23:37:59	@Espyo	yeah, nectar got "de-implemented"
2016-03-20 23:38:10	@Espyo	when changing the Pikmin logic, nectar stopped working, and I never reimplemented it
2016-03-20 23:38:15	@Espyo	I even removed it from the "Play" area
2016-03-20 23:38:41	@Espyo	...oh crap, are you telling me I bundled the two test maps with the engine's release?
2016-03-20 23:38:46	@Espyo	welp
