2016-03-21 00:26:42	@Espyo	well, there are some debugging tools I left on in this version
2016-03-21 00:26:53	@Espyo	next time something happens, let me know, so you can use one of the tools to get me more info about the problem
2016-03-21 00:27:06	@Espyo	Dwarf Red Bulborbs can die instantly if you throw a Pikmin at their backs
2016-03-21 00:27:13	@Espyo	but Red Bulborbs? that's weirder

2016-03-21 00:59:54	ScruffyChat	Hello! I'm back
2016-03-21 00:59:58	ScruffyChat	For longer now
2016-03-21 01:00:42	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy, Bulborbs_At_View!
2016-03-21 01:01:53	@Espyo	oh, I guess I didn't get the other questions, no
2016-03-21 01:01:59	@Espyo	hey Scruffy
2016-03-21 01:02:09	ScruffyChat	Hi Espyo
2016-03-21 01:02:50	Neocraftz1553	mm...
2016-03-21 01:02:50	Neocraftz1553	Will there be a Lock-On feature
2016-03-21 01:02:50	Neocraftz1553	Whill there be a charging feature?
2016-03-21 01:03:03	Neocraftz1553	Will there be reactions if Pikmin hit different parts of an enemy?
2016-03-21 01:03:16	Neocraftz1553	Rock and Winged Pikmin?
2016-03-21 01:03:20	@Espyo	lock-on and charging is currently not planned
2016-03-21 01:03:37	@Espyo	different parts of an enemy reacting in different ways already exists, even if it's currently simple
2016-03-21 01:03:39	Neocraftz1553	Explosions?
2016-03-21 01:03:39	Neocraftz1553	annd... thats islt
2016-03-21 01:03:39	Neocraftz1553	*it
2016-03-21 01:03:48	@Espyo	the Red Bulborb suffers more damage if you hit its backside
2016-03-21 01:03:55	@Espyo	and the Cloaking Burrow-nit, the front
2016-03-21 01:04:06	@Espyo	I'll implement some system to cause specific actions and such later on
2016-03-21 01:04:14	@Espyo	Rock Pikmin maybe, Winged Pikmin no
2016-03-21 01:04:19	@Espyo	they change SO much of so many internal things
2016-03-21 01:04:29	@Espyo	that it'd require rewriting and over-complicating so many things just to get them in
2016-03-21 01:04:44	@Espyo	I'd rather make the engine stronger for other Pikmin types with other strengths/weaknesses than implement Winged Pikmin
2016-03-21 01:04:49	@Espyo	explosions will come eventually
2016-03-21 01:06:14	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-21 01:06:14	Neocraftz1553	thanks for the answers
2016-03-21 01:06:14	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see
2016-03-21 01:06:20	@Espyo	no problem
2016-03-21 01:06:34	Neocraftz1553	Rock Pikmin do a set amount of damage, but don't latch on, so I can see where that's complicated
2016-03-21 01:07:05	Neocraftz1553	and Winged Pikmin fly, thats complicated enough on its own
2016-03-21 01:07:42	@Espyo	yeah, honestly, the worst part about Rock Pikmin would be making them attack on their own
2016-03-21 01:07:52	@Espyo	you know, where they strike, get down, get up, repeat
2016-03-21 01:07:52	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-21 01:07:58	@Espyo	and even then that's not really that complicated
2016-03-21 01:08:11	@Espyo	so it'd just be a matter of "do I really want to spend some time making it possible, or do I want to work on other core features?"
2016-03-21 01:08:17	@Espyo	so yeah, "maybe" is definitely the answer
2016-03-21 01:08:21	@Espyo	but Winged Pikmin... man oh mna
2016-03-21 01:08:22	@Espyo	*man
2016-03-21 01:08:42	Neocraftz1553	maybe adding them last
2016-03-21 01:08:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-21 01:08:56	@Espyo	it might be easier to add them in the future
2016-03-21 01:08:58	@Espyo	the engine's still young
2016-03-21 01:09:01	Neocraftz1553	the core features have gotta be a top priority 
2016-03-21 01:09:09	@Espyo	hard stuff now might be easier later when stuff is more flexible
2016-03-21 01:09:11	@Espyo	yeah, agreed
2016-03-21 01:09:14	@Espyo	specially hazards
2016-03-21 01:09:30	@Espyo	without hazards, Pikmin types don't really matter
2016-03-21 01:09:32	Neocraftz1553	heh, yeah
2016-03-21 01:09:39	Neocraftz1553	true dat
2016-03-21 01:09:50	ScruffyChat	Except Yellow Pikmin, for now
2016-03-21 01:10:11	Neocraftz1553	and Purple... or other Pikmin that can carry alot
2016-03-21 01:11:46	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-21 01:11:56	@Espyo	hm, actually
2016-03-21 01:11:57	Neocraftz1553	The only other thing is that they look pretty cool
2016-03-21 01:11:57	Neocraftz1553	You can cross a river with 100 red pikmin, soo...
2016-03-21 01:11:57	Neocraftz1553	or attack a supposedly firey Bulblax with Yellows...
2016-03-21 01:12:03	@Espyo	as it is right now, every Pikmin is different, on the engine
2016-03-21 01:12:07	@Espyo	Reds do cause more damage atm
2016-03-21 01:12:21	@Espyo	Yellows are thrown higher, Purples are slower and stronger carriers, and Whites are faster
2016-03-21 01:12:31	@Espyo	and Blues... are different from all the others in that they have no special trait
2016-03-21 01:14:04	Neocraftz1553	physical properties
2016-03-21 01:14:04	Neocraftz1553	Whites=fast
2016-03-21 01:14:04	Neocraftz1553	Yellows=high af
2016-03-21 01:14:04	Neocraftz1553	Purples=Strong
2016-03-21 01:14:04	Neocraftz1553	yeah, blues have nothing...
2016-03-21 01:14:04	Neocraftz1553	but all the other fan Pikmin are like blues unless you vhange their Speed, Attack, and throw hight
2016-03-21 01:14:17	Neocraftz1553	height
2016-03-21 01:14:34	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-21 01:14:53	Neocraftz1553	Hows the Pikmin kart coming along, Scruffy
2016-03-21 01:15:13	ScruffyChat	Well, I've been working on a section of the Formidable Oak track preview
2016-03-21 01:15:37	Neocraftz1553	Sounds nice
2016-03-21 01:17:25	@Espyo	sweet
2016-03-21 01:17:31	Neocraftz1553	Oh yeah, I made a Stone gate in the engine
2016-03-21 01:18:25	Neocraftz1553	Is the Formidable Oak preview going to look like the render, more or less?
2016-03-21 01:20:15	ScruffyChat	Which render?
2016-03-21 01:22:04	Neocraftz1553	Yellow Onion...
2016-03-21 01:22:04	Neocraftz1553	...Amprat...
2016-03-21 01:22:05	Neocraftz1553	..uhh...
2016-03-21 01:22:05	Neocraftz1553	...electric arcs...
2016-03-21 01:22:22	ScruffyChat	Oh that one
2016-03-21 01:22:35	ScruffyChat	I'm going to try to make it look a bit more like the Formidable Oak than that
2016-03-21 01:22:41	Neocraftz1553	mmhm
2016-03-21 01:23:02	Neocraftz1553	oh...
2016-03-21 01:23:16	Neocraftz1553	like in P3
2016-03-21 01:23:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-21 01:23:57	ScruffyChat	With more of the foliage
2016-03-21 01:24:03	ScruffyChat	and Plasm Wraithiness
2016-03-21 01:26:15	Bulborbs_At_View	I must admit to slight confusion. Is Scruffy making Formidable Oak in the PFE?
2016-03-21 01:27:12	ScruffyChat	Not quite, I'm making a video in Blender, the open source 3D modeling application
2016-03-21 01:27:43	ScruffyChat	it's an intro cutscene to a fake karting track of the formidable oak, miming Mario Kart 8
2016-03-21 01:29:12	ScruffyChat	It'll be about 15 seconds long, but that can take hours to render so it'll be a while before its' complete
2016-03-21 01:29:15	ScruffyChat	it's*
2016-03-21 01:30:49	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-21 01:31:06	Neocraftz1553	I hate rendering animations in blender, but I love it
2016-03-21 01:31:13	ScruffyChat	yeah
2016-03-21 01:31:30	ScruffyChat	Really if you can get the animation right, the rendering time is worth it
2016-03-21 01:31:38	ScruffyChat	Unless it's unreasonably high, of course
2016-03-21 01:32:35	Neocraftz1553	an hour each...
2016-03-21 01:36:46	Bulborbs_At_View	Ah. I'd do 3D models... if I was even remotely good at art
2016-03-21 01:37:08	Bulborbs_At_View	The best I can settle for are N64-like crummy models of maps that I made.

2016-03-21 11:19:56	Testyo	the further down the article, the more unrelated and useless the separation makes sense
2016-03-21 11:20:00	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-21 11:32:50	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUyeJh4hCcE 46?
2016-03-21 11:32:56	@Espyo	 100% guarantee that at least one of them will be wrong
2016-03-21 11:33:16	@Espyo	does mispronouncing "melee" count?
2016-03-21 11:33:35	@Espyo	wait what
2016-03-21 11:33:40	@Espyo	these first few ones aren't even facts
2016-03-21 11:35:05	@Espyo	theeeeere it is
2016-03-21 11:35:07	@Espyo	that didn't take long
2016-03-21 11:35:18	@Espyo	the good ol' myth that Miyamoto said the series take place after human extinction
2016-03-21 11:35:25	@Espyo	and that so far, 0 people have managed to get a source on that
2016-03-21 11:44:13	@Espyo	WHY DOES HE INSIST ON PRONOUNCING EVERYTHING WRONG
2016-03-21 12:52:55	Yoshi2	"pikmin olimar facts" by some show? I'm already not interested
2016-03-21 13:02:50	@Espyo	pretty much the only reaction you should have
2016-03-21 13:03:37	Yoshi2	last night I had some of the worst pain I ever had in my legs because I went overboard with bike riding yesterday, hnnnngg
2016-03-21 13:04:08	Yoshi2	at least it's better now
2016-03-21 13:04:27	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-21 13:04:29	@Espyo	that's good
2016-03-21 13:04:45	@Espyo	I love the feeling of my chest or legs hurting after I do something physically stressful
2016-03-21 13:04:49	@Espyo	okay, put it like that, it sounds wrong
2016-03-21 13:05:02	Yoshi2	my legs didn't just hurt
2016-03-21 13:05:06	@Espyo	but I know that that's a sign of a good workout, so I'm pleased
2016-03-21 13:05:09	Yoshi2	it HURT
2016-03-21 13:05:26	@Espyo	gotta make sure these muscles of mine don't become weak
2016-03-21 13:05:29	Yoshi2	prevented me from sleeping
2016-03-21 13:05:32	@Espyo	well, that doesn't sound right then
2016-03-21 13:05:45	Yoshi2	well, I should probably do sport more often
2016-03-21 13:05:59	Yoshi2	and do breaks
2016-03-21 13:06:10	@Espyo	yes
2016-03-21 13:06:25	Yoshi2	the parts that started to hurt were the same ones that became tired yesterday
2016-03-21 13:08:10	Yoshi2	seems like the two options for doing online on the Wii are either wiimmfi or altwfc
2016-03-21 13:09:15	@Espyo	hm, didn't know about that second one
2016-03-21 13:10:44	Yoshi2	me neither
2016-03-21 13:11:12	Yoshi2	I'll have to check which one works better for battalion wars 2
2016-03-21 13:14:26	@Espyo	wiimmfi probably only works for MKWii and Smash
2016-03-21 13:14:34	@Espyo	back in the day, it had "rooms" for more games
2016-03-21 13:14:38	@Espyo	but I think those started to die out
2016-03-21 13:14:42	@Espyo	oh, also football games
2016-03-21 13:14:43	@Espyo	a ton of them
2016-03-21 13:14:51	@Espyo	wiimm loves his football :|
2016-03-21 13:16:53	Yoshi2	what keeps me from opening a room for the other games? :l
2016-03-21 13:17:26	@Espyo	you can create your own server if you know the protocols
2016-03-21 13:17:27	@Espyo	so nothing
2016-03-21 13:18:14	Yoshi2	too much work
2016-03-21 13:23:01	Yoshi2	and with room I meant on wiimmfi
2016-03-21 13:24:17	Yoshi2	I have an account on that wii hb forum, so I'll go test wiimmfi first
2016-03-21 13:28:01	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-21 13:28:13	@Espyo	not like room as in...
2016-03-21 13:28:31	@Espyo	well, see, wiimm has servers up for Brawl, Mario Kart Wii, and probably others
2016-03-21 13:28:48	@Espyo	I don't think he has a server for allowing players to play BW2 online
2016-03-21 13:31:14	Yoshi2	I'd guess the entire thing is simple enough that more games can be supported by a single server
2016-03-21 13:31:30	@Espyo	I'm not so sure
2016-03-21 13:31:35	@Espyo	each game has its own data to send and receive
2016-03-21 13:31:42	@Espyo	you need to know what the data is and how to process it
2016-03-21 13:31:47	@Espyo	although most games are just P2P
2016-03-21 13:31:49	@Espyo	the matchmaking isn't
2016-03-21 13:32:10	Yoshi2	you won't discourage me from doing this
2016-03-21 13:32:27	@Espyo	I'll encourage you
2016-03-21 13:32:34	@Espyo	I just like doing that by throwing every challenge at once
2016-03-21 13:32:43	@Espyo	that way, once you get that out of the way, you see the light of hope right after
2016-03-21 13:32:55	@Espyo	instead of going through a long thin tunnel where the light is only visible after a long walk
2016-03-21 13:33:35	Yoshi2	I have faith that the author of wiimmfi does not mislead me by writing that BW2 is enabled
2016-03-21 13:34:01	@Espyo	is it?
2016-03-21 13:34:19	@Espyo	http://wiimm.de/wii/
2016-03-21 13:34:39	@Espyo	I can't speak foreign, but the list only has Mario Kart Wii, Animal Crossing, and S&SASR
2016-03-21 13:34:52	@Espyo	...whatever happened to Brawl?
2016-03-21 13:35:29	Yoshi2	I just need to find an sd card big enough so I can fit the patched bw2 on, and another one for the usb loader
2016-03-21 13:35:30	@Espyo	I'm not sure if that's the page that lists the servers
2016-03-21 13:35:34	@Espyo	ugh, I'm so confused
2016-03-21 13:35:56	Yoshi2	that's his personal page
2016-03-21 13:36:08	@Espyo	found that out just as you said it
2016-03-21 13:36:11	@Espyo	http://wiimmfi.de/
2016-03-21 13:36:26	Yoshi2	http://wiimmfi.de/stat
2016-03-21 13:36:59	@Espyo	there we go
2016-03-21 13:37:08	Yoshi2	it seems to hide games that aren't being played atm
2016-03-21 13:37:24	Yoshi2	you can make the page show all games
2016-03-21 13:37:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-21 13:37:36	Yoshi2	BW2 is marked as enabled and Testing
2016-03-21 13:37:44	@Espyo	well, that's great news then
2016-03-21 13:37:56	@Espyo	so much for making your own server

2016-03-21 13:38:12	Yoshi2	I'd rather go try altwfc than write my own server
2016-03-21 13:38:36	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-21 13:41:49	Yoshi2	ok, I found the sd card with the usb loader
2016-03-21 13:42:07	@Espyo	good
2016-03-21 13:42:11	Yoshi2	now I need to find another card to put my game on because I don't have any usb HDDs
2016-03-21 13:42:21	Yoshi2	poor man's usb stick

2016-03-21 14:00:15	Bulborbs_At_View	Anyway, this forum game I've been talking about is finally up and running! :D I've updated my topic with the link to the forum.
2016-03-21 14:03:45	Yoshi2	nice
2016-03-21 14:04:04	Yoshi2	Bulborbs_At_View: do you have a link to that? I currently have trouble finding the forum
2016-03-21 14:05:24	Bulborbs_At_View	http://pikminx-3.proboards.com/
2016-03-21 14:13:15	Yoshi2	oh joy, that's quite a fully featured pikmin game you came up with there
2016-03-21 14:13:41	Bulborbs_At_View	:D
2016-03-21 14:13:47	Yoshi2	I'm not sure how the turns work though
2016-03-21 14:13:59	Bulborbs_At_View	It's still early in "development" though, only 2 maps are currently available.
2016-03-21 14:14:25	Bulborbs_At_View	Are there any specific parts you don't understand?
2016-03-21 14:15:53	Yoshi2	so I write a post in which I do something that counts as a turn, but what happens then?
2016-03-21 14:16:22	Yoshi2	is there any limit to how many posts I can make?
2016-03-21 14:16:47	Bulborbs_At_View	Well, preferably you'd want to make one post per turn.
2016-03-21 14:17:04	Yoshi2	when do I know that a turn has passed, and if there is a second player what keeps us two from just alternating with the posts and speeding up the game?
2016-03-21 14:17:48	Bulborbs_At_View	Well, I'll make a post detailing what happens in a turn. Generally, I'll wait for all players currently on the map to have posted before making the reply post.
2016-03-21 14:18:27	Bulborbs_At_View	If there's only 1 person, it'll depend on them only; if there are 3 then I'll wait for those three to post (but as one of the rules outlines after 24 hours I'll simply skip their turn and make them idle)
2016-03-21 14:19:04	Yoshi2	who does the dice rolls? I guess not the players because they could rig the rolls easily
2016-03-21 14:19:35	Bulborbs_At_View	I'll make the rolls. I'll mention when I'm rolling the dice.
2016-03-21 14:20:51	Yoshi2	I see
2016-03-21 14:21:06	Yoshi2	that does make the game feel a bit like dungeons & dragons
2016-03-21 14:21:56	Bulborbs_At_View	Yeah. :) It's kind of a necessity, since Pikmin would otherwise not translate too well to the text format :P

2016-03-21 14:24:14	Bulborbs_At_View	Alright. If you have more you can ask them on the forum, that way future members will be able to know the answers to these questions as well :)
2016-03-21 14:25:47	ScruffyChat	Hi Bulborbs_At_View!
2016-03-21 14:26:00	ScruffyChat	Hi Yoshi2!
2016-03-21 14:26:13	Bulborbs_At_View	How goes it?
2016-03-21 14:26:26	ScruffyChat	I'm currently rendering my highest-sample render yet on Blender
2016-03-21 14:26:38	ScruffyChat	at 2500 samples per pixel, it's going to be a while
2016-03-21 14:26:53	ScruffyChat	I'd say 6-8 hours
2016-03-21 14:28:08	Bulborbs_At_View	That's the Formidable Oak 15 second video right?
2016-03-21 14:28:20	ScruffyChat	not yet
2016-03-21 14:28:30	ScruffyChat	I'm still modeling and animating that one
2016-03-21 14:28:36	ScruffyChat	That will take significantly longer
2016-03-21 14:29:04	ScruffyChat	Today I just went through old models I no longer wanted to keep and found one I had downloaded of Bowser from Super Mario 3D World
2016-03-21 14:29:21	ScruffyChat	It's a high-poly model, but I wanted to practice making something look cinematic
2016-03-21 14:30:55	ScruffyChat	so I've given his skin scale displacement, used a particle function to make his hair look more... hair-like, and studied some tips on cinematic lighting
2016-03-21 14:31:13	ScruffyChat	Hopefully this will look like a Bowser you'd see on a movie poster
2016-03-21 14:31:53	Bulborbs_At_View	Ooh! That sounds neat!
2016-03-21 14:31:59	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-03-21 14:32:12	ScruffyChat	I'll upload it to the forums in off-topic creations when it's done
2016-03-21 14:33:05	ScruffyChat	Right now the estimated time remaining says 4 hours, but once the render gets to the eyebrows that's probably going to go up to something like 7
2016-03-21 14:35:25	ScruffyChat	Oh, also, the Pikmin X-3 game sounds pretty fun
2016-03-21 14:35:40	ScruffyChat	I've never played a forum game before, so it seems like it'll be fun to try!
2016-03-21 14:41:58	Bulborbs_At_View	Thanks!

2016-03-21 18:23:34	Neocraftz1553	Hello Espyo, Yoshi2
2016-03-21 18:23:45	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-21 18:24:08	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy
2016-03-21 18:24:19	Neocraftz1553	Nice car design
2016-03-21 18:24:35	Neocraftz1553	can a Rock Pikmin drive it?
2016-03-21 18:25:13	ScruffyChat	Hi
2016-03-21 18:25:33	ScruffyChat	No, only leaders (and other Hocotatians/Koppaites) can drive in this
2016-03-21 18:25:49	ScruffyChat	Well, maybe Pikmin could drive...
2016-03-21 18:25:55	ScruffyChat	If you want Pikmin to drive
2016-03-21 18:25:55	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-21 18:26:03	Neocraftz1553	sure
2016-03-21 18:26:25	ScruffyChat	But Pikmin are also items, so it becomes sort of the Koopa using Koopa shells problem
2016-03-21 18:29:09	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-21 18:30:55	ScruffyChat	Man, I'm doing this render that, a couple of hours ago said it could be done in 7 hours
2016-03-21 18:31:04	ScruffyChat	Now I'm trying it again and it says 10 hours
2016-03-21 18:31:39	ScruffyChat	But to its credit I did change something that requires more calculation
2016-03-21 18:32:01	Neocraftz1553	What was it?
2016-03-21 18:32:21	ScruffyChat	I had hair particles that were "Line segments," and I changed it to "Curve segments"
2016-03-21 18:32:34	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-21 18:32:39	ScruffyChat	So it has to interpolate each hair as a smoother curve
2016-03-21 18:32:45	Neocraftz1553	that will probably be it
2016-03-21 18:32:53	Neocraftz1553	its like subdivision surface
2016-03-21 18:32:59	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2016-03-21 18:32:59	Neocraftz1553	on a smaller scale
2016-03-21 18:33:27	ScruffyChat	And otherwise I've finally gotten into using 4 subdivisions and ramping up samples to 2500 for this one
2016-03-21 18:34:00	Neocraftz1553	dang
2016-03-21 18:34:15	Neocraftz1553	you've gone all out
2016-03-21 18:34:26	Neocraftz1553	what kind of computer do you use?
2016-03-21 18:34:35	ScruffyChat	A poor little Macbook Pro
2016-03-21 18:34:44	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-21 18:34:47	Neocraftz1553	laptop?
2016-03-21 18:34:51	ScruffyChat	yep
2016-03-21 18:35:16	Neocraftz1553	So you're saying...
2016-03-21 18:35:25	Neocraftz1553	you do complex renders...
2016-03-21 18:35:33	Neocraftz1553	on a laptop?
2016-03-21 18:35:44	Neocraftz1553	I do that too...
2016-03-21 18:35:46	ScruffyChat	Every one that you've seen from me has come from this computer
2016-03-21 18:36:10	Neocraftz1553	hmm..
2016-03-21 18:36:17	Neocraftz1553	must have taken quite a while
2016-03-21 18:36:27	ScruffyChat	Naturally
2016-03-21 18:36:38	Neocraftz1553	I use a... uh..
2016-03-21 18:36:44	Neocraftz1553	laptop
2016-03-21 18:36:50	Neocraftz1553	it has a screen
2016-03-21 18:36:59	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-03-21 18:37:38	Neocraftz1553	what it is,  I do not know 
2016-03-21 18:38:13	ScruffyChat	Well there's only so far laptops can go with CG processing anyhow, I catch your drift
2016-03-21 18:38:15	Neocraftz1553	crud
2016-03-21 18:38:21	Neocraftz1553	might disconnect

2016-03-21 19:03:56	Neocraftz1553	Testyo
2016-03-21 19:03:57	Testyo	I rush into the living room, boot up the Wii U, and go to the live update comes out?!
2016-03-21 19:04:04	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-21 19:05:32	Neocraftz1553	So, how is the hazards system going to work
2016-03-21 19:05:38	Neocraftz1553	just curious
2016-03-21 19:06:00	Neocraftz1553	oh, and what type will be in the update
2016-03-21 19:06:07	Neocraftz1553	the canon types?
2016-03-21 19:06:25	@Espyo	types of what?
2016-03-21 19:06:39	Neocraftz1553	hazards
2016-03-21 19:10:07	Neocraftz1553	fanon engine
2016-03-21 19:11:49	Neocraftz1553	Fire, Water, Yellow...
2016-03-21 19:12:02	Neocraftz1553	I mean Electricity 
2016-03-21 19:12:07	Neocraftz1553	Poison
2016-03-21 19:12:09	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-03-21 19:12:14	Neocraftz1553	thats it
2016-03-21 19:12:14	@Espyo	sorry, was away
2016-03-21 19:12:22	@Espyo	yeah, I'll bundle some hazards with the engine
2016-03-21 19:12:23	Neocraftz1553	its cool
2016-03-21 19:12:27	@Espyo	probably the standard ones, yeah
2016-03-21 19:12:37	@Espyo	fire, electricity and water, definitely
2016-03-21 19:12:40	@Espyo	poison, maybe
2016-03-21 19:12:41	@Espyo	likely
2016-03-21 19:12:53	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-21 19:13:20	Neocraftz1553	and how is the system most likely going to work
2016-03-21 19:13:57	@Espyo	there will be two main components
2016-03-21 19:14:02	@Espyo	the hazard, and the status effect
2016-03-21 19:14:13	@Espyo	almost all hazards will need to rely on status effects
2016-03-21 19:14:20	@Espyo	a status effect is something that changes an object
2016-03-21 19:14:32	@Espyo	like "spicy", "on fire", etc.
2016-03-21 19:14:37	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-21 19:14:47	Neocraftz1553	constipated 
2016-03-21 19:14:50	@Espyo	ye
2016-03-21 19:14:57	@Espyo	good luck making the graphics for that though
2016-03-21 19:15:09	@Espyo	anyway, you can make any status effect
2016-03-21 19:15:10	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-03-21 19:15:17	@Espyo	you just specify its name, and what happens to the object that is affected
2016-03-21 19:15:27	@Espyo	like a change in speed, change in attack power, etc.
2016-03-21 19:15:31	@Espyo	also probably what sprites to use
2016-03-21 19:15:37	@Espyo	then you have the hazards
2016-03-21 19:15:41	@Espyo	you also set everything about the hazards

2016-03-21 19:15:47	@Espyo	what their name is... and their color, I guess
2016-03-21 19:15:51	@Espyo	that's probably all you need
2016-03-21 19:16:01	Neocraftz1553	simple enough 
2016-03-21 19:16:02	@Espyo	and then, for every Pikmin type, you specify what hazard or hazards they're invulnerable to
2016-03-21 19:16:14	Neocraftz1553	red for fire
2016-03-21 19:16:17	@Espyo	and when a Pikmin that is not vulnerable to a hazard touches said hazard, they get a status effect
2016-03-21 19:16:26	@Espyo	one of the status effects you specified before
2016-03-21 19:16:32	@Espyo	to know if a Pikmin "touched" a hazard
2016-03-21 19:16:36	@Espyo	you can specify it on the enemy's hitboxes
2016-03-21 19:16:39	@Espyo	or on the ground's sectors
2016-03-21 19:16:48	Neocraftz1553	Purple and Constipation
2016-03-21 19:17:04	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-21 19:17:45	Neocraftz1553	Like cyan and frost
2016-03-21 19:18:01	Neocraftz1553	frost makes Pikmin stop
2016-03-21 19:18:30	@Espyo	yeah

2016-03-21 19:19:33	Neocraftz1553	what about insta kill hazards
2016-03-21 19:20:15	@Espyo	you specify that on the hazard configuration too
2016-03-21 19:20:22	@Espyo	what happens when a non-invulnerable Pikmin touches this hazard?
2016-03-21 19:20:28	@Espyo	either set a status effect
2016-03-21 19:20:29	@Espyo	or kill
2016-03-21 19:20:44	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see 
2016-03-21 19:21:07	Neocraftz1553	simple, but complex
2016-03-21 19:21:17	@Espyo	simple, but powerful
2016-03-21 19:21:21	@Espyo	that's my entire goal with the engine
2016-03-21 19:22:11	Neocraftz1553	Its amazing how it is simple, but it does complex stuff behind the scenes
2016-03-21 19:22:37	Neocraftz1553	And its amazing how it reads text files
2016-03-21 19:24:08	@Espyo	a whole load of complicated stuff goes on in the background to make it possible
2016-03-21 19:24:15	@Espyo	it's a bit overbearing at times
2016-03-21 19:24:18	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-21 19:24:22	@Espyo	but I always find a way to pull through

2016-03-21 20:00:47	Neocraftz1553	I've got to stop looking at the roadmap...
2016-03-21 20:01:11	@J	wait, are you running Arch?
2016-03-21 20:01:11	Neocraftz1553	I get excited and start asking questions that should be saved for the future
2016-03-21 20:01:44	@J	also, last I checked those two were on [[hazard]]
2016-03-21 20:01:45	Testyo	"hazard" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=hazard
2016-03-21 20:02:27	@Espyo	I'm running Lubuntu
2016-03-21 20:02:36	@Espyo	but in general, that website seems like it applies for most things
2016-03-21 20:02:45	@Espyo	yeaaaaaah, they're only on that article because Pikmin 2 calls them hazards
2016-03-21 20:02:55	@J	not really, you can only use them on Arch
2016-03-21 20:03:24	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-21 20:03:29	@J	it's just common to have Arch users make pkgbuilds that go in AUR, so lots of projects will link to one when they don't have any official packages
2016-03-21 20:03:45	@Espyo	I see
2016-03-21 20:04:23	@J	generally what you want to do for *ubuntu is look in the repositories you have first, then look for a PPA on Launchpad, then look for a .deb on the project website
2016-03-21 20:05:45	@Espyo	right
2016-03-21 20:05:46	@Espyo	I'll try that
2016-03-21 20:05:49	@Espyo	thanks
2016-03-21 20:05:53	@J	if none of those exist and you have to build it yourself, and the project has no build instructions, then maybe the AUR package will show you how to build it
2016-03-21 20:06:55	@J	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=pasystray&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all looks like Ubuntu has that in the main repositories, BTW
2016-03-21 20:10:38	@Espyo	well, now I just feel stupid
2016-03-21 20:10:48	@Espyo	can't believe I didn't try it
2016-03-21 20:11:41	@Espyo	well, that worked instantly

2016-03-21 20:19:51	Neocraftz1553	Espyo, why does the onion spew seeds so close to it?
2016-03-21 20:20:09	@Espyo	because I didn't balance it enough

2016-03-21 20:21:12	@Espyo	well yeah
2016-03-21 20:21:20	@Espyo	I just didn't tweak it right
2016-03-21 20:21:26	@Espyo	how hard it spits, and to what directions
2016-03-21 20:22:19	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-21 20:22:37	Neocraftz1553	can you add the option to modify just that in the next update?

2016-03-21 20:23:53	@Espyo	well, I can't see that as being a very customizable thing
2016-03-21 20:24:09	@Espyo	like, it makes sense if game makers want to customize a lot of things, but an Onion's spew force isn't one of them
2016-03-21 20:24:41	@J	but think of the possibilities
2016-03-21 20:24:53	@J	having to race around the whole map to pluck those seeds
2016-03-21 20:25:14	@Espyo	if you want to break the engine THAT badly, you have other options that don't involve me adding a new option, is all

2016-03-21 21:30:46	@Espyo	let's see... likely causes...
2016-03-21 21:30:56	@Espyo	this only happened when you opened the texture suggestions, yeah?
2016-03-21 21:31:05	@Espyo	rather, when you clicked the button to set a texture

2016-03-21 21:41:50	@Espyo	before this happened, how many suggestions was the editor giving you?
2016-03-21 21:41:56	@Espyo	a lot? like, over 15?
2016-03-21 21:45:05	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-03-21 21:45:12	Neocraftz1553	 5
2016-03-21 21:45:30	Neocraftz1553	The button stayed pressed and then it crashed
2016-03-21 21:46:07	@Espyo	did you move any texture files around?
2016-03-21 21:46:12	@Espyo	rename, move, change at all
2016-03-21 21:46:12	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-03-21 21:46:40	@Espyo	dammit... I can't tell what the problem is right off the bat
2016-03-21 21:46:47	@Espyo	well, can you tinker around with it some more, to see if it happens again?
2016-03-21 21:46:47	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-21 21:46:51	@Espyo	I'll keep an eye out on my end
2016-03-21 21:46:52	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-21 21:46:56	@Espyo	I HATE these bugs
2016-03-21 21:47:00	Neocraftz1553	me too
2016-03-21 21:47:01	@Espyo	an enemy not dying is one thing
2016-03-21 21:47:10	@Espyo	but having an editor crash and lose minutes of unsaved work is just HORRIBLE
2016-03-21 21:47:10	Neocraftz1553	specially when work isn't saved
2016-03-21 21:47:22	@Espyo	it's kind of an unwritten rule with the engine... but when working on the editors, save constantly
2016-03-21 21:47:31	Neocraftz1553	oh, and it was a "blank" texture
2016-03-21 21:47:35	@Espyo	hmm?
2016-03-21 21:47:36	Neocraftz1553	a new segment
2016-03-21 21:47:43	@Espyo	you mean you made a new sector?
2016-03-21 21:47:44	Neocraftz1553	without any texture assigned to it
2016-03-21 21:48:03	Neocraftz1553	and then I clicked on the texture button then it crashed
2016-03-21 21:48:33	@Espyo	was this new sector inside another sector?
2016-03-21 21:48:45	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-03-21 21:49:06	@Espyo	weird

2016-03-21 22:12:58	@Espyo	hm, you're not the first to ask that in the past few days
2016-03-21 22:13:01	@Espyo	maturity=0

2016-03-21 22:13:15	Neocraftz1553	for bud and flower respectively
2016-03-21 22:13:29	Neocraftz1553	you should include the tags in the next update

2016-03-21 22:16:19	Neocraftz1553	and to seperate tags, a comma, right?

2016-03-21 22:17:33	Neocraftz1553	hmm... didn't work
2016-03-21 22:17:42	Neocraftz1553	just spawned a flowered yellow

2016-03-21 22:19:59	Neocraftz1553	if you barely start an area(doesn't matter which one) and switch to another captain as soon as it loads, you won't be able to move or change to the other captain
2016-03-21 22:20:09	Neocraftz1553	you'll only be able to move the cursor
2016-03-21 22:21:15	@Espyo	yeah, somewhere...
2016-03-21 22:21:22	@Espyo	a semicolon
2016-03-21 22:21:26	@Espyo	buried=true;maturity=0

2016-03-21 22:23:53	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-21 22:23:58	Neocraftz1553	try it

2016-03-21 22:24:20	Neocraftz1553	it'll be fun, they said
2016-03-21 22:32:05	Neocraftz1553	hey Espyo, quick question about links
2016-03-21 22:33:14	Neocraftz1553	Will two way links work the same as 1 way links?
2016-03-21 22:33:30	Neocraftz1553	will pikmin still follow them to the onions
2016-03-21 22:35:01	@Espyo	well, no
2016-03-21 22:35:04	@Espyo	the difference is just that
2016-03-21 22:35:08	@Espyo	two-way links, the Pikmin can take them both ways
2016-03-21 22:35:18	@Espyo	one-way links can only be taken in the direction the link is facin
2016-03-21 22:35:19	@Espyo	*g
2016-03-21 22:35:26	Neocraftz1553	so...
2016-03-21 22:35:38	@Espyo	you should try to use two-way links when possible
2016-03-21 22:35:43	@Espyo	so you don't have to worry about making the wrong direction
2016-03-21 22:35:49	Neocraftz1553	If the yellow onion is in a cave away from the landing site
2016-03-21 22:35:59	@Espyo	and only use one-way links when you want to specifically say that you can only go from this direction, not the other way around
2016-03-21 22:36:03	@Espyo	like down a wall, but not up one
2016-03-21 22:36:06	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see
2016-03-21 22:36:11	Neocraftz1553	like a cliff
2016-03-21 22:36:15	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-21 22:36:23	@Espyo	if the Yellow Onion is away from the landing site
2016-03-21 22:36:27	Neocraftz1553	ok, thanks for the tip/answer
2016-03-21 22:36:30	@Espyo	and all your paths are pointing away from it
2016-03-21 22:36:35	@Espyo	the Pikmin will not be able to reach it
2016-03-21 22:37:01	Neocraftz1553	thats where two way links come in
2016-03-21 22:37:03	Neocraftz1553	right?
2016-03-21 22:37:35	Neocraftz1553	a one way link can be used to prevent them from attempting to ram a wall down
2016-03-21 22:38:19	Neocraftz1553	good thing you decided to include a point A to B preview and closest stop into the engine
2016-03-21 22:43:40	Neocraftz1553	WHY DOESN'T OLIMAR PLUCK????
2016-03-21 22:44:20	Neocraftz1553	he doesn't pluck at times, just goes toward the buried pikmin and just stands there
2016-03-21 22:44:50	@Espyo	...
2016-03-21 22:44:51	@Espyo	weird
2016-03-21 22:44:53	@Espyo	oh, when that happens
2016-03-21 22:44:56	@Espyo	put your cursor under him
2016-03-21 22:44:58	@Espyo	press F5
2016-03-21 22:45:01	@Espyo	and tell me what his state is
2016-03-21 22:45:15	Neocraftz1553	oh, I should've done that...
2016-03-21 22:45:32	@Espyo	it's okay
2016-03-21 22:45:34	@Espyo	apparently that's common
2016-03-21 22:45:40	Neocraftz1553	I'll check his state when he does it
2016-03-21 22:45:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-21 22:45:49	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-21 22:45:53	Neocraftz1553	it'll probably happen again
2016-03-21 22:46:02	@Espyo	you do know that to pluck, you just press the mouse button once, right?
2016-03-21 22:46:09	@Espyo	because you press anything else, he'll cancel
2016-03-21 22:46:11	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-21 22:46:12	@Espyo	that could be what you're seeing

2016-03-21 22:55:03	@Espyo	:/
2016-03-21 22:55:22	@Espyo	there's technically 0 Pikmin in the Onion
2016-03-21 22:55:27	@Espyo	but you can pull out an infinite number anyway
2016-03-21 22:55:40	@Espyo	for player convenience while trying out the features, simply
2016-03-21 22:55:47	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-21 22:55:48	@Espyo	but I'll disable that in some later release

2016-03-21 22:57:04	Neocraftz1553	threw it at a sheargrub
2016-03-21 22:57:12	Neocraftz1553	and some spectralids were around
2016-03-21 22:57:17	Neocraftz1553	maybe one got in the way
2016-03-21 22:57:20	@Espyo	hmmmm
2016-03-21 22:57:23	@Espyo	that helps

2016-03-21 23:08:06	ScruffyChat	Okay, I've finally figured out a good medium for rendering this image
2016-03-21 23:08:17	ScruffyChat	7 or 8 more hours and i'll have it
2016-03-21 23:09:14	ScruffyChat	The problem was in a number that sets how accurately the renderer calculates a smooth curve for strands of hair
2016-03-21 23:09:46	ScruffyChat	Last time I tried it I set it to 10, which I thought meant iterations, when it actually means 2^10 iterations
2016-03-21 23:10:08	ScruffyChat	So understandably the estimated time on the render exceeded 30 hours, and I had to cut it short
2016-03-21 23:10:19	ScruffyChat	Now i've got 2^2, which should be enough
2016-03-21 23:10:32	ScruffyChat	And the hair will look curvy without taxing the renderer too much
2016-03-21 23:13:14	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy
2016-03-21 23:13:53	Neocraftz1553	sounds like you ran a few expirements with bledner

2016-03-21 23:14:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-21 23:14:29	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, you know the pikmin glitch I told you about
2016-03-21 23:14:46	Neocraftz1553	I left the window open, and the pikmin is still orbiting olimar
2016-03-21 23:14:46	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-21 23:15:01	@Espyo	orbiting?
2016-03-21 23:15:07	@Espyo	oh, you mean circling around Olimar?

2016-03-21 23:23:30	Neocraftz1553	and like planets going out of orbit of their sun, they just dispersed in different directions
2016-03-21 23:23:35	Neocraftz1553	very fast
2016-03-21 23:23:39	Neocraftz1553	like bullets xD

2016-03-21 23:35:07	Neocraftz1553	a group of reds joined the load, went the opposite way, and all got eaten by a bulborb

2016-03-21 23:36:06	Neocraftz1553	holy sh*t
2016-03-21 23:36:14	Neocraftz1553	It's destroying the bridge

2016-03-21 23:36:40	Neocraftz1553	it ate the bridge
2016-03-21 23:36:47	Neocraftz1553	err... built it
2016-03-21 23:36:57	Neocraftz1553	then it ate my pikmin
2016-03-21 23:37:04	@Espyo	hehehe yeah
2016-03-21 23:37:05	@Espyo	known problem
2016-03-21 23:37:07	@Espyo	easy to fix
2016-03-21 23:37:51	Neocraftz1553	does it just repeatedly target the bridge?
2016-03-21 23:38:02	@Espyo	yeah, a bridge is a Pikmin as far as it cares
2016-03-21 23:38:29	Neocraftz1553	as long as its a plant, Pikmin, sticks...or other enemies

2016-03-21 23:42:46	@Espyo	ooh, pretty water
2016-03-21 23:44:12	Neocraftz1553	THANKS
2016-03-21 23:44:17	Neocraftz1553	err.. caps lock
2016-03-21 23:44:40	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-21 23:47:04	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-21 23:47:31	Neocraftz1553	maybe if you somehow got an animated "white" texture linke the waters waves in the picture
2016-03-21 23:47:44	Neocraftz1553	and everything behind it was blue...
2016-03-21 23:47:45	@Espyo	yeah, that's my plan
2016-03-21 23:47:51	Neocraftz1553	It could pass as water
2016-03-21 23:48:03	Neocraftz1553	even more if it periodically glistened
2016-03-21 23:48:07	@Espyo	mhm
2016-03-21 23:48:25	ScruffyChat	And faintly reflected the sky above it
2016-03-21 23:48:27	ScruffyChat	back
2016-03-21 23:48:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-21 23:48:46	@Espyo	I want all of that
2016-03-21 23:48:50	@Espyo	I can imagine it now...
2016-03-21 23:48:54	@Espyo	I always planned something like that
2016-03-21 23:48:57	Neocraftz1553	hmm... that could actually make it look 10x more realistic
2016-03-21 23:48:59	@Espyo	but exactly HOW to get a convincing water top...
2016-03-21 23:49:04	@Espyo	an animated texture might be the only way
2016-03-21 23:49:40	Neocraftz1553	maybe later on you(or I) could make reflections for the water top...
2016-03-21 23:49:49	ScruffyChat	P1 and P2 used several textures at once
2016-03-21 23:49:51	Neocraftz1553	and then make different ones to choose from
2016-03-21 23:49:54	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-21 23:49:55	ScruffyChat	They aren't animated, they just move
2016-03-21 23:49:58	Neocraftz1553	like layers
2016-03-21 23:50:05	ScruffyChat	And they're layered on top of each other
2016-03-21 23:50:07	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2016-03-21 23:50:11	Neocraftz1553	ah, but this is 2D...
2016-03-21 23:50:25	ScruffyChat	But P2 and P3 really sell the realism by distorting the image behind them
2016-03-21 23:50:37	Neocraftz1553	so they can't move in the suttle ways in P1
2016-03-21 23:50:55	Neocraftz1553	and right now there isn't anything behind them....
2016-03-21 23:50:59	Neocraftz1553	...unless...
2016-03-21 23:51:33	Neocraftz1553	Espyo does something like the brightness setting...
2016-03-21 23:51:39	Neocraftz1553	maybe distortion setting
2016-03-21 23:52:10	@Espyo	everything will be placed on top of the water
2016-03-21 23:52:13	@Espyo	never below
2016-03-21 23:52:30	ScruffyChat	ah ok
2016-03-21 23:52:47	Neocraftz1553	so shallow it is
2016-03-21 23:52:49	ScruffyChat	Well then you could have the simple ripple effect that P2 has
2016-03-21 23:53:01	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-03-21 23:53:05	@Espyo	yeah, but...
2016-03-21 23:53:10	@Espyo	there's nothing SIMPLE about it
2016-03-21 23:53:10	ScruffyChat	when something's in the water, circles come out of it
2016-03-21 23:53:11	Neocraftz1553	but I'm not really sure how it'll work
2016-03-21 23:53:13	ScruffyChat	ture
2016-03-21 23:53:16	ScruffyChat	true*
2016-03-21 23:53:36	Neocraftz1553	or how it'll follow the current player...
2016-03-21 23:53:56	Neocraftz1553	and if there are multiple objects in the water, how the ripples will merge together
2016-03-21 23:54:14	Neocraftz1553	maybe put it down with the Rock and Winged Pikmin?

2016-03-21 23:56:46	Neocraftz1553	How to do ripples...
2016-03-21 23:56:47	@Espyo	pfft, I'll just take the Pikmin approach
2016-03-21 23:56:57	@Espyo	every ripple is just a bunch of white circles that grow
2016-03-21 23:57:00	@Espyo	who cares if they everlap
2016-03-21 23:57:04	@Espyo	who cares if they go off the water
2016-03-21 23:57:08	ScruffyChat	It's effective
2016-03-21 23:57:11	@Espyo	if Pikmin could pull it off, I will too
2016-03-21 23:57:13	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-03-21 23:57:29	Neocraftz1553	wait, so it'll bleed into the other sectors?
2016-03-21 23:57:39	ScruffyChat	Also I learned this in Little Big Planet; you can just have a big sky image follow you around and the water bits be a bit transparent
2016-03-21 23:57:53	Neocraftz1553	or reflective
2016-03-21 23:58:00	ScruffyChat	That way the water "reflects" the image when it's really a window to view the image behind it
2016-03-21 23:58:50	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see
2016-03-21 23:58:54	Neocraftz1553	like glass
2016-03-22 00:01:19	@Espyo	it will bleed, but you could never really tell from Pikmin, could you?
2016-03-22 00:01:26	@Espyo	so I'll trust it will be subtle on the engine too
2016-03-22 00:01:41	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-22 00:01:56	Neocraftz1553	hopefully it doesnt break
2016-03-22 00:02:04	@Espyo	unfortunately, I can't fake water reflection like that, Scruffy
2016-03-22 00:02:10	@Espyo	which is also what Pikmin does, btw!
2016-03-22 00:02:12	Neocraftz1553	like objects on other sectors generate the waves

2016-03-22 00:02:29	@Espyo	...
2016-03-22 00:03:25	Neocraftz1553	what about reflections
2016-03-22 00:03:59	Neocraftz1553	The background would have been fairly conveniant, letting players choose their own reflections
2016-03-22 00:06:25	@Espyo	yeah, I'll make water pretty customizable
2016-03-22 00:06:59	ScruffyChat	I still can't fathom how they made water like they did in P3
2016-03-22 00:07:18	ScruffyChat	It just doesn't seem like it can be done in a video game, in /realtime/
2016-03-22 00:07:18	@Espyo	with magic
2016-03-22 00:07:23	@Espyo	and more shaders than my engine has code

2016-03-22 00:08:10	Neocraftz1553	no wonder they made it for Wii U
2016-03-22 00:08:31	ScruffyChat	My secret plan is to score a music job at Nintendo and learn from the grapevine the secret to Pikmin 3 water
2016-03-22 00:08:47	Neocraftz1553	you spy :P
2016-03-22 00:08:49	ScruffyChat	and then we will know... how they programmed some geometry in this one game

2016-03-22 11:19:43	Chiaki_Nanami	hi
2016-03-22 11:19:45	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-22 11:19:54	Chiaki_Nanami	Espyo, did you hear about the events in Brussels?
2016-03-22 11:20:03	@Espyo	hmm, not really
2016-03-22 11:20:04	@Espyo	what's up?
2016-03-22 11:20:09	Chiaki_Nanami	terror attacks
2016-03-22 11:20:26	@Espyo	that's becoming so common nowadays...
2016-03-22 11:20:34	Chiaki_Nanami	there was an explosion at Brussels airport at 8am local time
2016-03-22 11:20:42	Chiaki_Nanami	and then the metro was bombed
2016-03-22 11:20:56	@Espyo	wow...
2016-03-22 11:20:58	@Espyo	how many deaths?
2016-03-22 11:21:03	Chiaki_Nanami	close to the EU parliament, too
2016-03-22 11:21:06	Chiaki_Nanami	about 20
2016-03-22 11:21:14	Chiaki_Nanami	the number is increasing by the minute
2016-03-22 11:21:19	@Espyo	I bet
2016-03-22 11:21:23	Chiaki_Nanami	the entire city is in a lockdown
2016-03-22 11:21:38	@Espyo	I can imagine
2016-03-22 11:22:36	Chiaki_Nanami	anyway, I'm feeling okay
2016-03-22 11:22:43	Chiaki_Nanami	but this thing
2016-03-22 11:22:46	Chiaki_Nanami	why did it need to happen
2016-03-22 11:23:00	@Espyo	because the terrorists want the world to get agitated
2016-03-22 11:23:17	@Espyo	so that others may fight back
2016-03-22 11:23:19	@Espyo	they want conflict
2016-03-22 11:25:36	Chiaki_Nanami	the theory that's floating about is that this series of attacks is a response to the arrest of Mohamed Abrini, the main suspect of the Paris attacks in November, which happened on Friady
2016-03-22 11:25:38	Chiaki_Nanami	*Friday
2016-03-22 11:26:01	@Espyo	ugh
2016-03-22 11:27:07	Chiaki_Nanami	why.jpg
2016-03-22 11:27:12	Chiaki_Nanami	World War II is over
2016-03-22 11:27:16	Chiaki_Nanami	this should not happen
2016-03-22 11:28:21	@Espyo	it's just the terrorists
2016-03-22 11:28:29	@Espyo	luckily not a whole load of nations in discord
2016-03-22 11:28:35	Chiaki_Nanami	good point
2016-03-22 11:29:32	Chiaki_Nanami	oh yeah, and about 50 people have been wounded
2016-03-22 11:30:06	@Espyo	I hope the number stays...
2016-03-22 11:30:13	Chiaki_Nanami	the Belgian Prime Minister has said that this is the worst thing that has happened to Belgium since World War II
2016-03-22 11:30:18	@Espyo	pretty low number, considering it's both an airport and a subway
2016-03-22 11:30:32	Chiaki_Nanami	and during rush hour, too
2016-03-22 11:30:48	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-22 11:36:33	Chiaki_Nanami	now I'm seeing reports of 28 being dead
2016-03-22 11:37:05	Chiaki_Nanami	or rather, a report
2016-03-22 11:38:55	Yoshi2	I'm more scared by the response of rightwingers than of terrorists
2016-03-22 11:39:27	Chiaki_Nanami	rightwingers always say dumb stuff
2016-03-22 11:39:34	Yoshi2	well, in general I am wondering what the response will be
2016-03-22 11:39:46	Yoshi2	terror attacks are commonly used to push stupid stuff through
2016-03-22 11:40:35	Chiaki_Nanami	mhm
2016-03-22 11:40:42	Chiaki_Nanami	like the war in Iraq
2016-03-22 11:41:33	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-22 11:42:55	Chiaki_Nanami	do you think that if this happened ten years ago, we would not know any of this until we read this in the papers/saw this on late-night TV
2016-03-22 11:43:11	Chiaki_Nanami	thanks internet
2016-03-22 11:43:20	Yoshi2	radio
2016-03-22 11:43:24	@Espyo	yeah, radio
2016-03-22 11:43:27	Chiaki_Nanami	oh right
2016-03-22 11:43:35	Chiaki_Nanami	I always forget about the radio
2016-03-22 11:43:38	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-22 11:43:40	@Espyo	everybody always does
2016-03-22 11:43:42	Yoshi2	it's a thing
2016-03-22 11:43:49	Yoshi2	you can use it on your phone
2016-03-22 11:43:54	@Espyo	pffft
2016-03-22 11:44:05	Chiaki_Nanami	technology!
2016-03-22 11:44:20	Chiaki_Nanami	technological advancements!
2016-03-22 11:44:33	Yoshi2	in other news, I think I figured out how to get internet working on my wii
2016-03-22 11:44:45	Yoshi2	turns out the second port works after all
2016-03-22 11:44:58	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-22 11:44:59	Chiaki_Nanami	yay
2016-03-22 11:45:04	Chiaki_Nanami	what is that going to be good for
2016-03-22 11:45:14	Chiaki_Nanami	Mario Kart Wii multiplayer?
2016-03-22 11:45:21	Chiaki_Nanami	or rather Funky Bike Wii
2016-03-22 11:45:53	@Espyo	Funkys on Bowser Bikes -- The Game
2016-03-22 11:46:07	Chiaki_Nanami	yeah
2016-03-22 11:46:23	Chiaki_Nanami	because like, the Wii is excellent as a pirate box
2016-03-22 11:46:38	Chiaki_Nanami	just pirate everything on the Wii
2016-03-22 11:46:52	Chiaki_Nanami	pirate your life on the Wii
2016-03-22 11:46:56	Chiaki_Nanami	your education
2016-03-22 11:49:29	Yoshi2	battalion wars 2 multiplayer if it works out
2016-03-22 11:50:12	Yoshi2	and yeah, the Wii has some great usb loaders
2016-03-22 11:51:04	Yoshi2	I'm glad I got everything set up ages ago because I don't think I'd be able to get it set up now
2016-03-22 11:51:13	Yoshi2	well, I would, but too much effort
2016-03-22 11:51:44	Chiaki_Nanami	the Wii also has some excellent wad managers
2016-03-22 11:52:11	Chiaki_Nanami	for instance, there's a Majora's Mask Master Quest .wad you can download to your Wii
2016-03-22 11:52:16	Chiaki_Nanami	i should play it
2016-03-22 11:52:51	Yoshi2	wii also has some excellent ios to go with the usb loader
2016-03-22 11:53:09	Chiaki_Nanami	I'm so glad the console is abandoned by Nintendo
2016-03-22 11:55:46	Yoshi2	but one question remains
2016-03-22 11:55:53	Chiaki_Nanami	I can't wait until the Wii U gets abandoned
2016-03-22 11:56:00	Yoshi2	does the wii have excellent memes
2016-03-22 11:56:11	Chiaki_Nanami	wagglan
2016-03-22 11:56:13	Chiaki_Nanami	miis
2016-03-22 11:56:23	Chiaki_Nanami	Miis are pretty memey
2016-03-22 11:56:33	Chiaki_Nanami	the Wiimote is memey
2016-03-22 12:30:31	Chiaki_Nanami	oh no, 34 are now claimed to be dead
2016-03-22 12:30:51	@Espyo	and it'll just keep going up...
2016-03-22 12:31:52	Yoshi2	well, duh
2016-03-22 12:31:58	Yoshi2	it probably won't be going down
2016-03-22 12:32:36	Chiaki_Nanami	people don't resurrect
2016-03-22 12:32:56	Chiaki_Nanami	*won't
2016-03-22 12:33:11	@Espyo	we could get false positives though
2016-03-22 12:33:20	Chiaki_Nanami	let's hope for those
2016-03-22 12:33:30	Chiaki_Nanami	sometimes, false positives are very good
2016-03-22 12:36:38	Yoshi2	not sure how likely false positives are though
2016-03-22 12:37:26	@Espyo	I'd bet they're ultra rare
2016-03-22 13:51:39	Chiaki_Nanami	sad
2016-03-22 13:53:11	Yoshi2	sad, but not suprising

2016-03-22 21:58:02	Neocraftz1553	I just scripted and made an animation for a red spectralid shaking

2016-03-22 21:58:33	Testyo	I said not sure pining is a hey because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages not sure pining is a word you want to use there and hey.
2016-03-22 21:59:12	Klemen702	hey neo
2016-03-22 21:59:21	Neocraftz1553	Hello Klemen702
2016-03-22 22:00:18	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, some enemies DO die before their time comes
2016-03-22 22:00:28	@Espyo	damn
2016-03-22 22:01:04	Neocraftz1553	I made a huge Twilight Spectralid andbit dies at quarter health
2016-03-22 22:01:23	Neocraftz1553	And a red bulborb died at half health 
2016-03-22 22:01:48	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-03-22 22:01:49	Neocraftz1553	And the huge spectralid doesn't get crushed by pikmin
2016-03-22 22:02:08	Neocraftz1553	They latch on (looks incredible)
2016-03-22 22:03:21	@Espyo	err...
2016-03-22 22:03:27	Neocraftz1553	Any possible explanation? 
2016-03-22 22:03:39	Neocraftz1553	I don't know why
2016-03-22 22:03:51	@Espyo	I can't think of any off the top of my head either
2016-03-22 22:03:52	Neocraftz1553	Or how it even happens
2016-03-22 22:04:30	Neocraftz1553	It only seems to happen with big damage interval enemies...
2016-03-22 22:04:37	Neocraftz1553	Ones that shake pikmin off
2016-03-22 22:05:01	Neocraftz1553	But then again, the dwarf red bulborb does it too
2016-03-22 22:05:18	Neocraftz1553	Does that have a big damage interval?

2016-03-22 22:05:59	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-22 22:07:17	Neocraftz1553	It isbpretty common
2016-03-22 22:07:34	Neocraftz1553	One way to do it is to get a white pikmin and attack a ree bulborb
2016-03-22 22:07:44	Neocraftz1553	Sometimes it happens
2016-03-22 22:07:55	Neocraftz1553	Sometimes the bulborb eats the pikmin
2016-03-22 22:08:11	Neocraftz1553	And sometimes the pikmin manages to kill the bulborb

2016-03-23 12:38:16	@Espyo	and figured that that's a glitch and added it to the wiki
2016-03-23 12:38:19	@Espyo	but good grief
2016-03-23 12:38:38	@Espyo	there's a higher chance that there is a secret human in all of the areas in all games than there is of that "glitch" being real

2016-03-23 12:55:01	Marty2000	I verified and noticed Olimar's journal for the Courage Reactor are just a translation of the notes for the Love and Courage Reactor (Japanese treasure).

2016-03-23 12:56:31	@Espyo	and then call the Courage Reactor's notes in to the article

2016-03-23 16:04:18	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-23 16:04:20	Marty2000	Ah, sorry. So the ideal would be an screenshot of the map indicating the cave location ? I could do that.
2016-03-23 16:04:31	@Espyo	yeah, if you want
2016-03-23 16:04:45	@Espyo	when you do so, move the images of the cave entrances to the gallery
2016-03-23 16:05:09	@Espyo	try to make the maps look similar to the one I linked
2016-03-23 16:05:13	@Espyo	in fact...

2016-03-23 16:05:30	@Espyo	there are some P2 maps done in the same way
2016-03-23 16:05:53	@Espyo	oh nice, I added instructions on that very same image
2016-03-23 16:06:07	@Espyo	if you're not quite sure how to do it, that's okay, I'll take care of it one of these days
2016-03-23 16:13:08	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-23 16:13:13	@Espyo	I haven't used -Wall in a while
2016-03-23 16:13:17	@Espyo	that explains the 199 errors

2016-03-23 16:14:38	Yoshi2	now you go and fix all of thexe errors

2016-03-23 16:15:00	@Espyo	they're meaningless

2016-03-23 16:15:43	@Espyo	wow these are scarier than what I'm accustomed to
2016-03-23 16:16:28	@Espyo	 /what/
2016-03-23 16:16:31	@Espyo	why is this an option
2016-03-23 16:16:44	@Espyo	if you declare class members in a certain order
2016-03-23 16:16:50	@Espyo	and then initialize them in a different order
2016-03-23 16:16:54	@Espyo	-Wall reports that as a warning
2016-03-23 16:17:08	@Espyo	how could that possibly matter?

2016-03-23 16:47:30	Marty2000	About "Grotte des Confins", your translation is maybe better than mine. However, it sounded more natural to say "edge" for me (and as an example, "Star Wars : the edge of the empire" is translated "Star Wars : Aux Confins de l'empire" in French). 
2016-03-23 16:47:49	@Espyo	right, right
2016-03-23 16:47:55	@Espyo	confines is not a common English word
2016-03-23 16:47:59	@Espyo	but it is more correct in this case
2016-03-23 16:48:19	@Espyo	if people really want to know the English translation of a French name, they get the actual translation, not a localization
2016-03-23 16:48:31	@Espyo	the localized name is... well, the name of the article :P
2016-03-23 16:48:48	Marty2000	Yes
2016-03-23 16:49:07	Marty2000	And I din't even know "confines" in English. But that's better

2016-03-23 18:25:58	@Espyo	well, depends a lot on what it is
2016-03-23 18:28:56	Yoshi2	in theory, it is simple enough to parse it
2016-03-23 18:29:14	Yoshi2	but changing it might be difficult because of dependence on various values in the archive

2016-03-23 20:11:09	@Espyo	I could've found this sooner if it crashed instead of acting like it's Javascript
2016-03-23 20:11:55	@Espyo	right, I see what the problem is
2016-03-23 20:11:59	@Espyo	the Pikmin are attacking the shaking hitbox
2016-03-23 20:12:04	@Espyo	which indeed, has 0 defence
2016-03-23 20:16:20	ScruffyChat	Oh, Espyo

2016-03-23 20:16:39	@Espyo	hmm?
2016-03-23 20:16:45	ScruffyChat	The "angle" setting on textures defaults back to 0 when you back out of texturing a sector; it doesn't appear to change
2016-03-23 20:16:57	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-23 20:17:09	@Espyo	that might be because of the way I coded that angle knob widget
2016-03-23 20:17:10	@Espyo	try this
2016-03-23 20:17:24	@Espyo	set your angle, click on the textbox, and only then back out
2016-03-23 20:17:52	ScruffyChat	Ah ok, that worked
2016-03-23 20:17:55	ScruffyChat	Thanks!
2016-03-23 20:17:59	@Espyo	ugh, I'll have to fix that
2016-03-23 20:18:10	@Espyo	it's horrible when you make changes, quit out, and then they don't apply
2016-03-23 20:18:19	@Espyo	only to realize that they didn't save like you thought they would
2016-03-23 20:19:33	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-03-23 20:19:40	@Espyo	anyway Neo, I fixed the problem
2016-03-23 20:19:50	@Espyo	the Pikmin were attacking the shaking hitbox, which they shouldn't

2016-03-23 20:35:23	Neocraftz1553	They weren't supposed to attack the shaking hitbox?
2016-03-23 20:35:44	Neocraftz1553	So, how did you fix it?
2016-03-23 20:35:52	Neocraftz1553	err... what did you doto fix it
2016-03-23 20:36:38	@Espyo	I just made it so that if they try to attack a shaking hitbox, it causes no damage
2016-03-23 20:38:16	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-23 20:38:28	Neocraftz1553	how do you do that?
2016-03-23 20:40:54	@Espyo	oh, it's not a script thing
2016-03-23 20:40:58	@Espyo	it's an engine thing
2016-03-23 20:41:01	@Espyo	you don't need to change anything on your end

2016-03-23 21:38:18	Testyo	Good evening everyone!
2016-03-23 21:41:27	Neocraftz1553	evening Testyo
2016-03-23 21:41:27	Testyo	yeah, I think I'll like this story
2016-03-23 21:41:33	Neocraftz1553	Hello Espyo
2016-03-23 21:41:36	@Espyo	hey
2016-03-23 21:43:53	ScruffyChat	Hi
2016-03-23 21:44:06	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, you know THAT OTHER glitch
2016-03-23 21:44:15	@Espyo	again, there are several
2016-03-23 21:44:19	Neocraftz1553	the one about the texture suggestions
2016-03-23 21:44:22	Neocraftz1553	heh, I know
2016-03-23 21:45:08	Neocraftz1553	the button and then it crashes
2016-03-23 21:45:17	Neocraftz1553	wrll, it happened again
2016-03-23 21:45:25	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-03-23 21:45:31	@Espyo	could you find a pattern now?
2016-03-23 21:45:39	Neocraftz1553	nah, not really
2016-03-23 21:45:49	Neocraftz1553	I pressed it tons of times last night
2016-03-23 21:46:08	Neocraftz1553	and it did nothing, so I decided tomake a test area just forfun
2016-03-23 21:46:20	Neocraftz1553	and then it crashed in the middle of it
2016-03-23 21:46:31	Neocraftz1553	I had 5-7 textures loaded on it
2016-03-23 21:47:33	Neocraftz1553	it seems to happen randomly
2016-03-23 21:48:24	Neocraftz1553	hey, maybe I should do some "Speed area" videos to see if it happens during one of them
2016-03-23 21:48:42	Neocraftz1553	timelapse of me makeing canon areas
2016-03-23 21:48:48	Neocraftz1553	on the engine
2016-03-23 21:48:57	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-23 21:49:06	@Espyo	I'll take a look at it next
2016-03-23 21:49:10	@Espyo	to see if I can find something too
2016-03-23 21:49:14	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-23 21:49:29	Neocraftz1553	I guess one of the easiest ways to find it,..
2016-03-23 21:49:40	Neocraftz1553	is to just make an area...
2016-03-23 21:50:05	Neocraftz1553	oh, I screenshotted it, but I don't think it'll help much..
2016-03-23 21:50:08	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-23 21:50:13	@Espyo	yeah, it won't help
2016-03-23 21:50:15	@Espyo	you sent me it before, actually
2016-03-23 21:50:22	Neocraftz1553	and the error log doesn't help either
2016-03-23 21:50:25	Neocraftz1553	I did?
2016-03-23 21:51:33	@Espyo	pretty sure you did
2016-03-23 21:51:43	@Espyo	I remember this screenshot where the texture button was pressed down
2016-03-23 21:51:51	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-23 21:51:59	@Espyo	maybe I just imagined it too hard? err...
2016-03-23 21:52:04	@Espyo	well, either way, it wouldn't really help, I'm afraid
2016-03-23 21:52:06	Neocraftz1553	I don't think I did
2016-03-23 21:52:15	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it won't 
2016-03-23 21:52:43	Neocraftz1553	but the texture button does indeed stay pressed down for a second or two
2016-03-23 21:53:09	Neocraftz1553	would debugging it when it crashes with visual studio work?
2016-03-23 21:53:14	@Espyo	yep

2016-03-23 21:53:36	Neocraftz1553	you see I would...
2016-03-23 21:53:39	@Espyo	try the crash while you're running it on a development environment
2016-03-23 21:53:51	Neocraftz1553	but I think I got a broken installer
2016-03-23 21:53:57	@Espyo	orange bulborb nickname? lemme see that
2016-03-23 21:54:05	@Espyo	oh, you mean for yourself
2016-03-23 21:54:08	@Espyo	hehehe, don't worry about it
2016-03-23 21:54:20	@Espyo	unless you know how to bind it to the code, it won't make a difference, I'm afraid
2016-03-23 21:54:25	@Espyo	hm, and even then
2016-03-23 21:54:36	@Espyo	it might be impossible for your case, because the program you're running doesn't have debugging-friendly information
2016-03-23 21:54:56	Neocraftz1553	visual studio?
2016-03-23 21:55:28	@Espyo	I mean the version of the engine you're running
2016-03-23 21:55:35	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see

2016-03-23 21:56:15	@Espyo	on that edit summary
2016-03-23 21:56:30	@Espyo	oh no
2016-03-23 21:56:33	@Espyo	what a horrible edit
2016-03-23 21:56:37	@Espyo	turned everything lowercase

2016-03-23 21:59:33	Neocraftz1553	when he shakes them off and lifts up his roller
2016-03-23 21:59:45	Neocraftz1553	they somehow all landed under that roller
2016-03-23 22:01:03	Neocraftz1553	then I saved the cave for last
2016-03-23 22:01:19	Neocraftz1553	It was like the final trail in P1

2016-03-23 22:09:04	Neocraftz1553	that would- yeah
2016-03-23 22:09:09	@Espyo	the current plan is to do Pikmin Color Splash
2016-03-23 22:09:12	@PikFan	I already got upset last year over that fake Pikmin 3 DLC lol
2016-03-23 22:09:18	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-23 22:09:22	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-03-23 22:09:28	ScruffyChat	I could make cover art for Pikmin Color Splash if necessary
2016-03-23 22:09:46	Neocraftz1553	sounds good
2016-03-23 22:09:51	@Espyo	our previous plan was Pikmin Fates
2016-03-23 22:10:00	@Espyo	either one to mock Nintendo's most recent controversies
2016-03-23 22:10:09	@Espyo	but Color Splash is probably the way to go because it's more recent
2016-03-23 22:10:09	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 22:10:22	@Espyo	Fates is almost out in Europe and people are starting to not care so much about its problems
2016-03-23 22:10:33	Neocraftz1553	whats it about?
2016-03-23 22:10:39	Neocraftz1553	color splash
2016-03-23 22:10:40	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing the premise is that you can apply colors to blank Pikmin to choose their attributes?
2016-03-23 22:10:49	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-23 22:10:56	@Espyo	the idea would be to mock the card system
2016-03-23 22:11:01	@Espyo	which is what made Sticker Star so bad
2016-03-23 22:11:09	Neocraftz1553	oooh, I see
2016-03-23 22:11:10	@Espyo	instead of having your attacks, you have a limited pool of specific attacks
2016-03-23 22:11:19	@Espyo	that should translate to Pikmin nicely, but nobody can agree how on
2016-03-23 22:11:19	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin
2016-03-23 22:11:48	Neocraftz1553	I guess making 2-D Pikmin cards... err, nah
2016-03-23 22:12:07	Neocraftz1553	sprays
2016-03-23 22:12:40	Neocraftz1553	bomb rocks
2016-03-23 22:12:56	Neocraftz1553	I don't know
2016-03-23 22:13:19	Neocraftz1553	cause you could do Pikmin 2 and 3 with no sprays, I think
2016-03-23 22:13:28	@PikFan	I've got nothing
2016-03-23 22:13:29	@Espyo	yeah, you can, easily
2016-03-23 22:13:35	Neocraftz1553	knew it
2016-03-23 22:13:58	Neocraftz1553	I did more than half of P2 without sprays
2016-03-23 22:14:18	Neocraftz1553	I only knew about them because I dismissed my pikmin near one of the plants
2016-03-23 22:14:44	Neocraftz1553	I guess spray attacks?
2016-03-23 22:15:10	Neocraftz1553	nah, I don't know how it'll fit into the series
2016-03-23 22:15:26	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-03-23 22:16:02	@PikFan	unrelated, but on Miiverse I made a discussion about why people hate squid parties
2016-03-23 22:16:11	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-03-23 22:16:20	@PikFan	Splatoon thing
2016-03-23 22:16:25	Neocraftz1553	Party with squids?
2016-03-23 22:16:34	Neocraftz1553	ah. ok
2016-03-23 22:16:39	@PikFan	and this one user said he hates them because you're not playing the game correctly
2016-03-23 22:16:41	@PikFan	that's like
2016-03-23 22:16:44	@PikFan	the
2016-03-23 22:16:49	@PikFan	dumbest
2016-03-23 22:16:50	@PikFan	reason
2016-03-23 22:16:50	@PikFan	to hate a squid party
2016-03-23 22:16:56	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 22:17:05	Neocraftz1553	there is no incorrect way to play a game
2016-03-23 22:17:11	@PikFan	there are much better reasons to hate a squid party
2016-03-23 22:17:24	@PikFan	like the repetitiveness, annoyingness, etc
2016-03-23 22:17:37	@PikFan	but just because you're not playing the game correctly?
2016-03-23 22:17:41	@PikFan	that's downright stupid
2016-03-23 22:18:19	Neocraftz1553	as long as you've got a controller in your hands and somethings on a screen, you're playing it correctly
2016-03-23 22:18:27	@PikFan	I suppose
2016-03-23 22:18:35	@PikFan	really, you're playing the game to have fun
2016-03-23 22:18:41	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 22:18:43	@PikFan	and some people think squid parties are fun
2016-03-23 22:18:48	@PikFan	so... they party
2016-03-23 22:18:57	Neocraftz1553	with squids
2016-03-23 22:19:34	@PikFan	it just really bothered me, because he's basically saying "I hate squid parties for no reason"
2016-03-23 22:19:55	Neocraftz1553	could've just said that
2016-03-23 22:20:21	@PikFan	this is what a squid party is btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8afaS9gChA
2016-03-23 22:20:57	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-03-23 22:21:50	@PikFan	and also, does it really take too much effort to join another group because you're too stuck up and snobby to squid around and have a good time
2016-03-23 22:22:00	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-23 22:23:01	@PikFan	the same guy said on another post, (might misquote) "I'm making it my personal mission to stop squid partys #endthepartys"
2016-03-23 22:23:21	@PikFan	again, you're giving them a lot of undeserved and unwarranted hate
2016-03-23 22:23:28	ScruffyChat	What's he going to do?
2016-03-23 22:23:34	@PikFan	be a jerk
2016-03-23 22:23:40	ScruffyChat	Nintendo gets plenty of letters

2016-03-23 22:24:04	@PikFan	well, they haven't done anything about squid parties, so they'll probably continue
2016-03-23 22:24:42	@PikFan	Espyo, wasn't there something like squid parties (I think they were called taunt parties?) in Smash but Nintendo shut them down, or something?
2016-03-23 22:24:52	@Espyo	not really
2016-03-23 22:24:58	@Espyo	there was taunt parties in Brawl
2016-03-23 22:24:59	@PikFan	oh
2016-03-23 22:25:10	@Espyo	but people who wanted to play seriously couldn't because of them
2016-03-23 22:25:20	@Espyo	so to fix that, for Smash 4, Nintendo made the For Fun and For Glory rooms
2016-03-23 22:25:48	@PikFan	maybe they'll do something like that for Splatoon 2
2016-03-23 22:25:53	@PikFan	*shrug*

2016-03-23 22:26:32	@PikFan	C'mon!
2016-03-23 22:26:47	Neocraftz1553	heh

2016-03-23 22:27:34	Neocraftz1553	To me
2016-03-23 22:28:07	Neocraftz1553	Splatoon: the CoD of Nintendo
2016-03-23 22:29:30	ScruffyChat	Splatoon 2 is a thing?
2016-03-23 22:29:38	Neocraftz1553	nah
2016-03-23 22:29:40	@PikFan	it will be
2016-03-23 22:29:44	@PikFan	it has to be
2016-03-23 22:29:54	Neocraftz1553	more DLCs
2016-03-23 22:30:01	Neocraftz1553	well, I guess
2016-03-23 22:30:02	@PikFan	there's no way that Nintendo won't make another Splatoon
2016-03-23 22:30:16	Neocraftz1553	for the NX
2016-03-23 22:30:22	ScruffyChat	Splatoon Color Splash would be much more appropriat
2016-03-23 22:30:23	Neocraftz1553	or whatever its called
2016-03-23 22:30:28	@PikFan	hahahah
2016-03-23 22:30:35	@Espyo	not having much luck replicating the area editor glitch
2016-03-23 22:30:50	Neocraftz1553	hehe
2016-03-23 22:30:54	@PikFan	yeah, my first thought when I saw the Paper Mario Color Splash trailer was about Splatoon
2016-03-23 22:30:55	Neocraftz1553	oh, yeah
2016-03-23 22:30:58	@PikFan	glitch?
2016-03-23 22:31:06	Neocraftz1553	theres a glitch
2016-03-23 22:31:11	Neocraftz1553	we've been hacked
2016-03-23 22:31:16	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-03-23 22:31:53	Neocraftz1553	theres a random glitch where the area editor will crash when the textures button is pressed
2016-03-23 22:32:00	Neocraftz1553	in the fanon engine
2016-03-23 22:32:08	@PikFan	huh
2016-03-23 22:32:17	@Espyo	heh PikFan
2016-03-23 22:32:20	@Espyo	"glitch?"
2016-03-23 22:32:26	@Espyo	there's at least ten glitches with the engine
2016-03-23 22:32:32	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 22:32:40	@Espyo	well, right now, at least
2016-03-23 22:32:44	Neocraftz1553	we're talking about THAT ONE glitch
2016-03-23 22:32:54	@Espyo	ye
2016-03-23 22:32:59	@PikFan	yeah, I don't know what THAT ONE glitch is
2016-03-23 22:33:01	Neocraftz1553	everyone knows which one THAT ONE is
2016-03-23 22:33:02	@PikFan	hence "glitch?"
2016-03-23 22:33:06	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-23 22:33:08	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 22:33:14	@PikFan	because I don't engine
2016-03-23 22:33:16	@Espyo	basically, the button to pick a texture on the area editor is randomly causing a crash
2016-03-23 22:33:17	@PikFan	and I need to engine
2016-03-23 22:33:19	@PikFan	but I don't
2016-03-23 22:33:21	@PikFan	therefore sad
2016-03-23 22:33:27	@Espyo	I forgot: why not?
2016-03-23 22:33:43	Neocraftz1553	no computer
2016-03-23 22:33:46	@PikFan	because I'd have to —
2016-03-23 22:33:48	@PikFan	...
2016-03-23 22:33:53	@PikFan	/obviously/
2016-03-23 22:33:54	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-03-23 22:34:21	@Espyo	...in the process, I'm just finding OTHER glitches with the area editor
2016-03-23 22:34:24	@PikFan	but anyway, I'm too lazy to install 7zip on the computer
2016-03-23 22:34:28	@Espyo	sectors starting to be considered broken when they shouldn't be
2016-03-23 22:34:29	@PikFan	that's why
2016-03-23 22:34:31	@PikFan	fun
2016-03-23 22:34:32	@Espyo	you don't need 7z
2016-03-23 22:34:38	@PikFan	wait whaaa
2016-03-23 22:34:40	@Espyo	it's not in a 7zip format any more
2016-03-23 22:34:47	@PikFan	...really?
2016-03-23 22:34:51	Neocraftz1553	.rar?
2016-03-23 22:34:51	@Espyo	so long as you have windows XP or above (hint: you do), you should be able to unzip it
2016-03-23 22:34:52	@PikFan	then what is it in???
2016-03-23 22:34:58	@Espyo	.zip format
2016-03-23 22:35:00	Neocraftz1553	that hint tho
2016-03-23 22:35:12	@Espyo	there's no way you're using windows 98 or 95
2016-03-23 22:35:13	@Espyo	sooooo
2016-03-23 22:35:24	Neocraftz1553	I use 95
2016-03-23 22:35:25	@PikFan	wait so I can extract it without needing another program
2016-03-23 22:35:29	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-03-23 22:35:29	@Espyo	no you don't |:
2016-03-23 22:35:35	@Espyo	nobody alive does
2016-03-23 22:35:37	@Espyo	it's just a myth
2016-03-23 22:35:39	@Espyo	it's older than dinosaurs
2016-03-23 22:35:44	@Espyo	yes, PikFan
2016-03-23 22:35:45	Neocraftz1553	I have a 95
2016-03-23 22:35:54	@Espyo	almost all modern operative systems can open .zip files straight away
2016-03-23 22:36:00	Neocraftz1553	quite sad actually
2016-03-23 22:36:02	@PikFan	Espyo, I beg to differ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucCxtgN6sc
2016-03-23 22:36:02	@Espyo	at least, modern for the past 8 or so years
2016-03-23 22:36:07	Neocraftz1553	but kinda cool too
2016-03-23 22:36:08	@Espyo	other formats might need other programs
2016-03-23 22:36:18	@Espyo	ugh, not that channel
2016-03-23 22:36:26	@Espyo	those ratings though

2016-03-23 22:38:03	@PikFan	Espyo, I've been wanting to make [[f:Pikmin fangame engine]] a featured article for Fanon, but my only worry is somebody'll see it and report it
2016-03-23 22:38:03	Testyo	"Pikmin_fangame_engine" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_fangame_engine
2016-03-23 22:38:05	@Espyo	do you get a lot of red "ERROR" textures on the list of suggestions?
2016-03-23 22:38:18	@Espyo	eh, I wouldn't say you need to worry
2016-03-23 22:38:20	Neocraftz1553	Im back

2016-03-23 22:38:57	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-03-23 22:39:11	@Espyo	I really can't recreate the crash
2016-03-23 22:39:11	Neocraftz1553	unless I get the extension wrong
2016-03-23 22:39:19	Neocraftz1553	hmm..
2016-03-23 22:39:27	Neocraftz1553	how many textures do you have loaded?
2016-03-23 22:39:44	@Espyo	currently, 3 normal ones, 4 ERROR ones
2016-03-23 22:40:04	Neocraftz1553	on purpose, I'm guessing
2016-03-23 22:40:08	@Espyo	yeah, on purpose
2016-03-23 22:40:12	Neocraftz1553	try 5-8 normal ones
2016-03-23 22:40:15	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-23 22:40:27	Neocraftz1553	Error ones don't. seem to do anything
2016-03-23 22:40:31	@PikFan	LOKETJIGOEJGIENBEV
2016-03-23 22:40:33	@PikFan	WHYYYYYY
2016-03-23 22:40:40	Neocraftz1553	the engine probably ignores them

2016-03-23 22:40:46	@PikFan	freaking Family Safety...

2016-03-23 22:41:39	@PikFan	but
2016-03-23 22:41:47	@PikFan	...oh, I see what you're saying
2016-03-23 22:41:50	@Espyo	so you can't open the zip file?
2016-03-23 22:41:58	@PikFan	no, I downloaded it
2016-03-23 22:42:02	@PikFan	extracted it just fine
2016-03-23 22:42:04	@PikFan	opened the folder
2016-03-23 22:42:10	Neocraftz1553	"mom, can I use it"
2016-03-23 22:42:11	@PikFan	and tried to open the engine program itself
2016-03-23 22:42:13	Neocraftz1553	err...

2016-03-23 22:43:12	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-23 22:43:15	@Espyo	here's a stupid idea
2016-03-23 22:43:19	@Espyo	but it's not as stupid as windows
2016-03-23 22:43:23	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 22:43:32	@Espyo	on the folder, go on the menu at the top, View, Folder Options...
2016-03-23 22:43:35	@Espyo	or something along those lines
2016-03-23 22:43:46	Neocraftz1553	windows 95
2016-03-23 22:43:59	@Espyo	after a dialog box opens up, tell me what tabs you see at the top
2016-03-23 22:44:25	Neocraftz1553	system type: 98
2016-03-23 22:45:04	@PikFan	eh, I'll just ask for the password

2016-03-23 22:45:12	@PikFan	here goes an incredibly awkward moment
2016-03-23 22:45:17	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-03-23 22:45:34	Neocraftz1553	put it on speaker xD
2016-03-23 22:46:03	@Espyo	no glitch on my end...
2016-03-23 22:46:10	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-23 22:46:12	@Espyo	hey, when it happens
2016-03-23 22:46:14	@Espyo	if you load the map
2016-03-23 22:46:21	@Espyo	and follow the same steps, does the glitch happen again?
2016-03-23 22:46:24	Neocraftz1553	what type of computer are you using
2016-03-23 22:46:28	@Espyo	if so, you can just send me the map and I'll follow the same steps
2016-03-23 22:46:29	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-23 22:46:31	@Espyo	type is not-95

2016-03-23 22:50:33	@J	Espyo, what did Testyo send me
2016-03-23 22:50:34	Testyo	I can replace the model data directly, but as soon as I guess :s
2016-03-23 22:50:37	@Espyo	hm?

2016-03-23 22:50:58	@Espyo	I can't scroll to it
2016-03-23 22:51:05	@Espyo	was it something like "you have a memo" yadda yadda?

2016-03-23 22:52:20	@J	[11:32:50] Testyo Oh, J, you have a memo from 1, written on that thing (GMT), saying: Espyo.

2016-03-23 22:52:32	@Espyo	yeah, I ran an earlier exe for Testyo over here with Wine
2016-03-23 22:52:32	Testyo	you need either a popular page, like cyan
2016-03-23 22:52:36	@Espyo	didn't realize the exe I was running was so old
2016-03-23 22:52:42	@Espyo	I guess the memo database was different back then

2016-03-23 22:53:02	@Espyo	you're lucky you got ONE

2016-03-23 22:53:49	@Espyo	what, the engine?
2016-03-23 22:54:01	@PikFan	Norton freaked out over it briefly but it's running

2016-03-23 22:54:09	@Espyo	well, enjoy
2016-03-23 22:54:23	Neocraftz1553	you have been enlightened 
2016-03-23 22:54:33	@PikFan	how do I put Pikmin back into Onions
2016-03-23 22:54:39	Neocraftz1553	you can't 
2016-03-23 22:54:41	@Espyo	well, Neo, if it happens again, after you restart the engine, load the area again and do steps until you get the crash again
2016-03-23 22:54:47	@Espyo	then send me the map file and tell me what steps you took
2016-03-23 22:54:48	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-23 22:54:51	@Espyo	so I can do the same here
2016-03-23 22:54:56	@Espyo	until then... guess I'll move to a different glitch
2016-03-23 22:54:58	Neocraftz1553	sounds good

2016-03-23 22:56:00	Neocraftz1553	the Pikmin are dirty, so the onion doesn't accept them Pikfan
2016-03-23 22:56:07	Neocraftz1553	throw them in water
2016-03-23 22:56:10	@PikFan	lol
2016-03-23 22:56:16	Neocraftz1553	but...
2016-03-23 22:56:24	Neocraftz1553	water isn't. implemented yet...
2016-03-23 22:56:45	Neocraftz1553	so the pikmin stay out once they are out

2016-03-23 22:57:34	ScruffyChat	hahaha
2016-03-23 22:57:54	@PikFan	is "ye" like your new catchphrase, Espyo
2016-03-23 22:57:59	@Espyo	ye
2016-03-23 22:58:06	@Espyo	you never saw "ye" before?
2016-03-23 22:58:08	@PikFan	I see
2016-03-23 22:58:11	@PikFan	no, I have
2016-03-23 22:58:25	@Espyo	well, sometimes you just need something to say yes, but not entirely a "yeah"
2016-03-23 22:58:26	@PikFan	just... I haven't seen you use it as much as you do now
2016-03-23 22:58:28	@Espyo	so you just half-ass it
2016-03-23 22:58:34	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-23 22:58:47	Neocraftz1553	hahaha
2016-03-23 22:58:54	Neocraftz1553	why not
2016-03-23 22:59:09	@PikFan	we kinda just take everyone's catchphrases and use them
2016-03-23 22:59:18	@PikFan	there's so many things I say because of Espyo
2016-03-23 22:59:20	Neocraftz1553	sounds good...
2016-03-23 22:59:23	Neocraftz1553	I think
2016-03-23 22:59:27	@Espyo	|:
2016-03-23 22:59:44	@PikFan	?
2016-03-23 22:59:46	Neocraftz1553	ye, bare bones...
2016-03-23 22:59:48	ScruffyChat	that's the point of catchphrases: hence the name, they "catch" on
2016-03-23 22:59:53	Neocraftz1553	uh...
2016-03-23 22:59:59	@PikFan	right
2016-03-23 23:00:04	@PikFan	oh, uh
2016-03-23 23:00:05	Neocraftz1553	idk
2016-03-23 23:00:06	@PikFan	controls
2016-03-23 23:00:12	@Espyo	check the README
2016-03-23 23:00:18	@Espyo	or the sign below where you spawn

2016-03-23 23:00:23	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 23:00:42	Neocraftz1553	nectar works pretty bare-bones right now
2016-03-23 23:00:44	@PikFan	the sign is blank, so I'll try to read the README
2016-03-23 23:00:54	Neocraftz1553	blank?
2016-03-23 23:00:57	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-03-23 23:00:57	@Espyo	isn't the sign telling you to click?
2016-03-23 23:01:04	@PikFan	nope
2016-03-23 23:01:04	Neocraftz1553	your trying THAT ONE map
2016-03-23 23:01:05	@PikFan	nothing
2016-03-23 23:01:12	Neocraftz1553	the test map
2016-03-23 23:01:15	@PikFan	yes
2016-03-23 23:01:20	Neocraftz1553	try the "Play" map
2016-03-23 23:01:23	ScruffyChat	did you approach the sign with olimar
2016-03-23 23:01:26	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-03-23 23:01:28	@Espyo	don't play the other maps
2016-03-23 23:01:37	@Espyo	they were never meant to be bundled, dammit...
2016-03-23 23:01:39	@PikFan	so play the Play map?
2016-03-23 23:01:45	Neocraftz1553	do play the others, their tons of fun
2016-03-23 23:01:45	@Espyo	yeah, that's the only real map
2016-03-23 23:01:48	@PikFan	gotcha
2016-03-23 23:01:50	@Espyo	the others are hey, guess what, test maps
2016-03-23 23:01:58	Neocraftz1553	test and paths
2016-03-23 23:02:33	Neocraftz1553	Simple maps to test anything you want to test
2016-03-23 23:02:46	Neocraftz1553	at least, the "test" map
2016-03-23 23:03:00	@PikFan	ok, I'm on the Play map now
2016-03-23 23:03:02	@PikFan	hooray
2016-03-23 23:03:08	Neocraftz1553	woohoo
2016-03-23 23:03:18	@PikFan	how do I make the window bigger
2016-03-23 23:03:24	ScruffyChat	Go Pikfan go
2016-03-23 23:03:27	@Espyo	you can change Options.txt
2016-03-23 23:03:29	@PikFan	this 400x200 (?) is too small
2016-03-23 23:03:36	@Espyo	but eh
2016-03-23 23:03:37	@PikFan	oh
2016-03-23 23:03:38	@Espyo	it's not that small
2016-03-23 23:03:40	@Espyo	well, it is
2016-03-23 23:03:40	@Espyo	but
2016-03-23 23:03:43	@Espyo	it works fine enough
2016-03-23 23:03:48	Neocraftz1553	says the developer
2016-03-23 23:03:51	@Espyo	'course
2016-03-23 23:03:55	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 23:04:13	Neocraftz1553	it is a good window size, though
2016-03-23 23:04:44	Neocraftz1553	you go full screen on every thing, pikfan?
2016-03-23 23:05:07	Neocraftz1553	are you just used to it
2016-03-23 23:05:26	@PikFan	yay
2016-03-23 23:05:27	@PikFan	bigger
2016-03-23 23:05:32	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-03-23 23:05:47	@Espyo	changing the window size sucks
2016-03-23 23:05:51	@Espyo	there's two ways I can do it
2016-03-23 23:05:57	@Espyo	either let people with bigger windows see more
2016-03-23 23:06:08	@Espyo	or let people with bigger windows see the same amount, but more zoomed in
2016-03-23 23:06:11	@Espyo	currently you see more
2016-03-23 23:06:13	@Espyo	which could be cheating
2016-03-23 23:06:19	@Espyo	but seeing stuff more zoomed in kinda bleh
2016-03-23 23:06:20	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-23 23:06:26	@Espyo	since everything looks blurry zoomed in

2016-03-23 23:06:34	@Espyo	unless I make HD graphics for everything
2016-03-23 23:06:36	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 23:06:39	Neocraftz1553	nah
2016-03-23 23:06:51	@Espyo	and then cry because the engine is this Hollywood blockbuster with fancy graphics and no gameplay
2016-03-23 23:06:54	Neocraftz1553	too much work, not core mechanics/features
2016-03-23 23:07:04	@Espyo	so there's no right answer for what to do to different window sizes
2016-03-23 23:07:22	@Espyo	at least the HUD looks nicer with bigger windows
2016-03-23 23:07:26	Neocraftz1553	gameplay before graphics, I say
2016-03-23 23:07:39	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-23 23:08:22	Neocraftz1553	can't have an engine that only displays an HD olimar running around a blank void, now can we
2016-03-23 23:08:44	@PikFan	Espyo, why is the whistle's range limited
2016-03-23 23:08:50	@PikFan	it should be like in NPC
2016-03-23 23:08:58	@Espyo	NPC! was a mistake
2016-03-23 23:09:06	@Espyo	whistling Pikmin from all across the map... cut me a break
2016-03-23 23:09:08	Neocraftz1553	change in Config
2016-03-23 23:09:09	ScruffyChat	You can change the whistle distance if you want though
2016-03-23 23:09:17	Neocraftz1553	under Misc
2016-03-23 23:09:22	@Espyo	but yeah, it is possible, as per ^
2016-03-23 23:09:25	Neocraftz1553	I changed it to 300...
2016-03-23 23:09:30	@PikFan	hmm ok
2016-03-23 23:09:34	ScruffyChat	Yeah, NPC broke a few rules of logic
2016-03-23 23:09:40	Neocraftz1553	try out 1000
2016-03-23 23:09:43	@Espyo	unlimited whistle makes the whistle kinda broken
2016-03-23 23:09:48	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 23:09:48	ScruffyChat	And I can't stand the sounds they used for Bulborbs
2016-03-23 23:09:51	@Espyo	plus, it effectively creates two cursors
2016-03-23 23:09:57	@Espyo	one for where the Pikmin land when thrown, one for whistling
2016-03-23 23:10:00	Neocraftz1553	*squeal
2016-03-23 23:10:06	@Espyo	combine that with the physical mouse cursor, and you'd have THREE cursors
2016-03-23 23:10:08	@Espyo	ABSOLUTELY not
2016-03-23 23:10:12	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-23 23:10:14	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 23:10:17	@Espyo	the engine's already confusing as is with 2...
2016-03-23 23:10:26	Neocraftz1553	not really
2016-03-23 23:10:28	@PikFan	ok, fine, I'll correct myself:
2016-03-23 23:10:31	@Espyo	sometimes I try to whistle and throw to the mouse cursor, because I forget it can't go past the leader cursor
2016-03-23 23:10:35	@PikFan	it should be like in Pikmin 3
2016-03-23 23:10:36	Neocraftz1553	set it to 10
2016-03-23 23:10:42	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 isn't much better
2016-03-23 23:10:46	@Espyo	my cursor is over there
2016-03-23 23:10:50	@Espyo	and the Pikmin fall short
2016-03-23 23:10:59	Neocraftz1553	its between NPC and P2
2016-03-23 23:11:01	@Espyo	only then do I realize "oh yeah, this thing has  trajectory prediction"
2016-03-23 23:11:05	Neocraftz1553	G
2016-03-23 23:11:09	Neocraftz1553	GC
2016-03-23 23:11:14	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 23:11:26	@PikFan	wait, where's Config
2016-03-23 23:11:28	@Espyo	but as time goes by, I'll gather more feedback and more ideas
2016-03-23 23:11:35	@Espyo	maybe one day I'll create the perfect cursor system
2016-03-23 23:11:40	Neocraftz1553	go to Game_
2016-03-23 23:11:42	@Espyo	or Nintendo will beat me to the punch with P4 and I'll just copy it
2016-03-23 23:11:43	Neocraftz1553	uh...
2016-03-23 23:11:45	@Espyo	Game_data
2016-03-23 23:11:50	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 23:11:51	@Espyo	then Misc, then Config.txt
2016-03-23 23:11:53	@PikFan	oh, that's why
2016-03-23 23:11:55	@PikFan	I was in Options
2016-03-23 23:11:59	Neocraftz1553	^
2016-03-23 23:12:01	Neocraftz1553	^^^
2016-03-23 23:12:07	@Espyo	yeah, it's a game setting, not really a player option
2016-03-23 23:12:26	Neocraftz1553	you can change versions and game name too
2016-03-23 23:12:33	@PikFan	gah, why is everything in a super long horizontal line
2016-03-23 23:12:34	Neocraftz1553	I think thats pretty awsome
2016-03-23 23:12:45	Neocraftz1553	are you using notepad?
2016-03-23 23:12:45	@Espyo	.........
2016-03-23 23:12:48	@Espyo	yeah ^
2016-03-23 23:12:51	@Espyo	because Notepad is cancer
2016-03-23 23:12:53	Neocraftz1553	try notepad++
2016-03-23 23:12:56	@Espyo	and windows is cancer
2016-03-23 23:13:04	@Espyo	combined, they form the fall of mankind
2016-03-23 23:13:06	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-03-23 23:13:10	Neocraftz1553	hehe
2016-03-23 23:13:34	@PikFan	eh, I'll try not to whine too much
2016-03-23 23:13:35	Neocraftz1553	notepad is pretty horrible though
2016-03-23 23:13:46	Neocraftz1553	look for cursor_length

2016-03-23 23:13:52	Neocraftz1553	err... something like that
2016-03-23 23:14:04	Neocraftz1553	reply to your slap Espyo
2016-03-23 23:14:24	@PikFan	wait, what happens if I add a bunch of line breaks
2016-03-23 23:14:31	@PikFan	will it break everything
2016-03-23 23:14:40	Neocraftz1553	imnot sure that would be a good idea
2016-03-23 23:14:54	@Espyo	you'll do the opposite
2016-03-23 23:15:03	@PikFan	...?
2016-03-23 23:15:07	@Espyo	quick run down...:
2016-03-23 23:15:18	@PikFan	I won't break anything?
2016-03-23 23:15:26	@Espyo	on Linux, a line break is represented by a character X
2016-03-23 23:15:29	@Espyo	on Mac, by a character Y
2016-03-23 23:15:38	@Espyo	on windows, because WHY THE FUCK NOT, it's represented by XY
2016-03-23 23:15:43	@Espyo	my files come with the X only
2016-03-23 23:15:54	@Espyo	notepad sees only the X, and doesn't think that's a line break
2016-03-23 23:16:00	Neocraftz1553	hehe
2016-03-23 23:16:01	@Espyo	you can add a line break yourself, which will create XY
2016-03-23 23:16:06	@PikFan	...oh
2016-03-23 23:16:06	@Espyo	the engine can read it either way
2016-03-23 23:16:12	Neocraftz1553	I see
2016-03-23 23:16:13	@Espyo	it can read lines separated by X, Y, XY, or any combination
2016-03-23 23:16:17	@Espyo	so you can break it if you want to
2016-03-23 23:16:21	Neocraftz1553	Yx
2016-03-23 23:16:34	@PikFan	...the hell? when I typed "...oh" it also typed it in the notepad :s
2016-03-23 23:16:34	@Espyo	but the ideal would be to ditch notepad and get something that doesn't listen to windows's stupidity
2016-03-23 23:16:39	@Espyo	|:
2016-03-23 23:16:45	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 23:16:50	@PikFan	well then
2016-03-23 23:16:59	@PikFan	these shenanigans aren't getting me anywhere
2016-03-23 23:17:08	Neocraftz1553	notepad++
2016-03-23 23:17:14	@Espyo	>Ok! I`ll put this in a Google doc to remember.
2016-03-23 23:17:18	@Espyo	how do I even react to this
2016-03-23 23:17:24	Neocraftz1553	it comes with different languages 
2016-03-23 23:17:34	@PikFan	my reaction is this:
2016-03-23 23:17:35	@PikFan	what
2016-03-23 23:17:40	Neocraftz1553	coding languages
2016-03-23 23:17:59	@Espyo	well, those aren't languages as much as they are ways to highlight the different key words in different languages
2016-03-23 23:18:25	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-23 23:18:31	Neocraftz1553	they sure do help
2016-03-23 23:18:37	@Espyo	mhm
2016-03-23 23:18:40	Neocraftz1553	well, to me, anyways

2016-03-23 23:26:05	Neocraftz1553	'bout mobs or anything
2016-03-23 23:26:50	ScruffyChat	I would maybe make a new texture for the boss spectralid
2016-03-23 23:27:00	ScruffyChat	A larger one
2016-03-23 23:28:27	@Espyo	I'll be releasing the original SVG files before long
2016-03-23 23:28:28	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2016-03-23 23:29:14	Neocraftz1553	maybe release them with 0.7.1
2016-03-23 23:29:31	@Espyo	I won't release them with the engine, but I'll make it available on the repository
2016-03-23 23:29:36	@Espyo	where the rest of the source code is
2016-03-23 23:29:42	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-23 23:29:46	@Espyo	it's possible to get the SVG files without getting the rest of the source code, so great
2016-03-23 23:29:56	Neocraftz1553	when?
2016-03-23 23:30:05	@Espyo	maybe with 0.7.1, yeah
2016-03-23 23:30:14	Neocraftz1553	ah ok
2016-03-23 23:31:54	@PikFan	hey, does it matter how many spaces are between the equal sign and the words for the parameters/values
2016-03-23 23:32:04	@PikFan	because I want to line them up like we do on infoboxes
2016-03-23 23:32:11	Neocraftz1553	 I think....

2016-03-23 23:32:21	Neocraftz1553	ask the developer

2016-03-23 23:32:58	@Espyo	abc=123
2016-03-23 23:33:00	@Espyo	is exactly the same as

2016-03-23 23:34:31	@Espyo	hm?
2016-03-23 23:34:43	Neocraftz1553	what kinds of states are there

2016-03-23 23:34:58	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-23 23:35:10	@Espyo	well, there's a state for the main menu, the options, one for each editor, and one for gameplay
2016-03-23 23:35:24	Neocraftz1553	mobs?
2016-03-23 23:35:27	Neocraftz1553	scripts
2016-03-23 23:35:49	@Espyo	well, depends on the mob
2016-03-23 23:35:59	@Espyo	Pikmin, leaders, and other specific mobs have specific states
2016-03-23 23:36:03	@Espyo	dozens of them
2016-03-23 23:36:07	Neocraftz1553	enemies
2016-03-23 23:36:11	@Espyo	enemies have whatever states are created in their scripts
2016-03-23 23:36:23	Neocraftz1553	*facepalms*
2016-03-23 23:36:25	@Espyo	the engine doesn't care what they are or how many
2016-03-23 23:36:33	Neocraftz1553	aaah, I see
2016-03-23 23:36:45	Neocraftz1553	the animations are the states...
2016-03-23 23:36:47	Neocraftz1553	kinda
2016-03-23 23:36:52	@Espyo	not necessarily
2016-03-23 23:36:55	@Espyo	a state is like a state of mind
2016-03-23 23:37:00	@Espyo	an animation is just what you see the enemy doing
2016-03-23 23:37:01	Neocraftz1553	gravity and timers
2016-03-23 23:37:11	@Espyo	the Red Bulborb could be doing the walking animation
2016-03-23 23:37:17	Neocraftz1553	what the enemy is going to do next?
2016-03-23 23:37:19	@Espyo	but it could be in the chasing state, the going_home state, etc.
2016-03-23 23:37:25	Neocraftz1553	like the dwarf reds
2016-03-23 23:37:27	@Espyo	in part, yeah
2016-03-23 23:37:37	Neocraftz1553	walking around aimlessly
2016-03-23 23:37:39	@Espyo	I explain what a state is better on the tutorial at the wiki
2016-03-23 23:37:48	Neocraftz1553	chewing up my walls
2016-03-23 23:37:52	Neocraftz1553	that kinda stuff

2016-03-23 23:38:26	Neocraftz1553	it was kinda funny, though, you haveta admit

2016-03-23 23:47:23	@Espyo	good thing about having the engine compile in just a few seconds instead of 5 minutes
2016-03-23 23:47:30	@Espyo	it's fast and saves times
2016-03-23 23:47:31	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2016-03-23 23:47:57	Neocraftz1553	o
2016-03-23 23:48:02	Bulborbs_At_View	Yes, things that are faster are generally faster. :P
2016-03-23 23:48:05	@Espyo	there's no good news feed aggregrator, it's ridiculous
2016-03-23 23:48:09	@Espyo	yeeeep
2016-03-23 23:48:36	Neocraftz1553	and things that are slower, generally consume time
2016-03-23 23:48:40	@Espyo	and there's another glitch solved
2016-03-23 23:48:45	@Espyo	switching leaders just as the area loads
2016-03-23 23:48:52	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-23 23:48:55	@Espyo	the game needs one tick to set up stuff for some objects
2016-03-23 23:49:04	@Espyo	and if you switch while it's loading, it'd switch on the first tick possible
2016-03-23 23:49:08	@Espyo	which is before some objects are ready
2016-03-23 23:49:11	@Espyo	meaning stuck
2016-03-23 23:49:15	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-23 23:49:18	Neocraftz1553	a small one, but nevertheless, annoying
2016-03-23 23:49:29	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-03-23 23:49:37	@Espyo	I compiled this change to fix it, then tested to see if it happened, it didn't, I closed the engine, opened again, tested again, ..., repeated 3 times
2016-03-23 23:49:41	@Espyo	took like 30 seconds in total
2016-03-23 23:49:47	@Espyo	on windows, this would've taken like 8 minutes total
2016-03-23 23:49:57	Neocraftz1553	:b

2016-03-23 23:52:10	@Espyo	Lenovo Y700
2016-03-23 23:52:13	Neocraftz1553	a Ludu....
2016-03-23 23:52:16	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-23 23:52:27	Neocraftz1553	I'll check it out
2016-03-23 23:53:04	Neocraftz1553	looks cool...
2016-03-23 23:53:09	Neocraftz1553	 8GB Ram...
2016-03-23 23:53:17	Neocraftz1553	GPU...
2016-03-23 23:53:24	@Espyo	mhm
2016-03-23 23:53:57	M6	ya should build a nice computer
2016-03-23 23:54:03	M6	one with dual Intel Xeons
2016-03-23 23:54:08	M6	those come pretty cheap
2016-03-23 23:54:20	Neocraftz1553	hmm....
2016-03-23 23:54:26	Neocraftz1553	hmmmmmmmmmm
2016-03-23 23:55:10	Neocraftz1553	what is yours secondary color Espyo?
2016-03-23 23:55:40	@Espyo	I could, but I've settled with this one
2016-03-23 23:55:44	@Espyo	plus I was never really a hardware guy
2016-03-23 23:56:05	<--	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.hv.zp) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-03-23 23:56:06	@Espyo	so knowing the differences between different brands of hardware, where to get them, compatibilities, etc. isn't my best

2016-03-23 23:56:12	M6	ahh, I see
2016-03-23 23:56:17	@Espyo	my secondary color...? I'd say blue
2016-03-23 23:56:25	Neocraftz1553	on your computer
2016-03-23 23:56:35	ScruffyChat	Ugh sometimes my Wifi quits and the only remedy is to continually pull down the Wifi menu and select it again and again
2016-03-23 23:56:40	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-23 23:56:41	@Espyo	hurr
2016-03-23 23:56:43	Neocraftz1553	there seems to be red by default...
2016-03-23 23:56:44	@Espyo	well, this is red and black
2016-03-23 23:56:50	ScruffyChat	I've done it so many times I now call it "petting the Wifi"
2016-03-23 23:56:51	@Espyo	mostly black, parts of red
2016-03-23 23:56:53	Neocraftz1553	ah I see
2016-03-23 23:57:00	@Espyo	what the hell
2016-03-23 23:57:04	Neocraftz1553	Black i its primary
2016-03-23 23:57:15	Neocraftz1553	Red is its secondary
2016-03-23 23:57:33	Neocraftz1553	it should look like the one on my screen
2016-03-23 23:57:42	Neocraftz1553	doesn't look too bad actually
2016-03-23 23:57:53	@Espyo	ok, so according to GitHub, my project is 5% Makefile
2016-03-23 23:57:59	@Espyo	since my Makefile is only like 10 lines long
2016-03-23 23:58:02	Neocraftz1553	some of the keyboard is red
2016-03-23 23:58:03	@Espyo	...I guess that means the engine is pretty tiny
2016-03-23 23:58:11	Neocraftz1553	hmm.,
2016-03-23 23:58:13	@Espyo	either GitHub is nuts, or I'm amazing at writing small code
2016-03-23 23:58:22	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-23 23:58:35	@Espyo	oh, and 1% of my code is C instead of C++
2016-03-23 23:58:39	@Espyo	I'm guessing those are the .h files?
2016-03-23 23:58:44	@Espyo	if so, GitHub is definitely nuts
2016-03-23 23:58:49	@Espyo	I have like 30 .h files
2016-03-23 23:58:51	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-23 23:58:53	@Espyo	averaging on like 50 lines
2016-03-23 23:58:58	@Espyo	how is that much less than the tiny Makefile?
2016-03-23 23:59:07	@Espyo	whatever
2016-03-23 23:59:08	@Espyo	next glitch
2016-03-23 23:59:40	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin disband erratically
2016-03-24 00:00:28	@Espyo	I never got that to happen
2016-03-24 00:00:31	Neocraftz1553	swarm them into the edge of an abyss like the one in the test map
2016-03-24 00:00:32	@Espyo	did you get it more than once?
2016-03-24 00:00:37	Neocraftz1553	but dont let them die
2016-03-24 00:00:40	Neocraftz1553	easilly
2016-03-24 00:01:01	Neocraftz1553	then, they should start circling you, not going behind you
2016-03-24 00:01:18	@Espyo	wait, wh--
2016-03-24 00:01:19	@Espyo	WHAA
2016-03-24 00:01:23	Neocraftz1553	disband them, and most of them go out in different directions
2016-03-24 00:01:24	@Espyo	IT COMPILED THE FULL ENGINE IN 10 SECONDS
2016-03-24 00:01:29	@Espyo	I know it's fast but EESH
2016-03-24 00:01:41	Neocraftz1553	not used to it, are you
2016-03-24 00:01:48	@Espyo	I'm really not!
2016-03-24 00:01:55	Neocraftz1553	I would be suspisions it left out code, too
2016-03-24 00:01:56	@Espyo	bluh, anyway, let me try it then
2016-03-24 00:02:35	Neocraftz1553	oh, and they should be one solid ground too
2016-03-24 00:02:46	@Espyo	ok, so...
2016-03-24 00:02:50	@Espyo	I have a group of 24
2016-03-24 00:02:55	Neocraftz1553	you can go to the opposite of the spawn point
2016-03-24 00:03:01	@Espyo	I swarm them to the edge of the abyss on Test
2016-03-24 00:03:07	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-03-24 00:03:11	@Espyo	and then I let go off space, that it?
2016-03-24 00:03:17	Neocraftz1553	I think
2016-03-24 00:03:25	Neocraftz1553	as long as they cicle you
2016-03-24 00:03:26	@Espyo	they come back to me normally
2016-03-24 00:03:29	Neocraftz1553	circle
2016-03-24 00:03:36	Neocraftz1553	disband
2016-03-24 00:03:40	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-24 00:03:59	@Espyo	all good all the time
2016-03-24 00:04:02	Neocraftz1553	no, they have to be in the abyss
2016-03-24 00:04:07	Neocraftz1553	but come out
2016-03-24 00:04:09	@Espyo	they have to fall in?
2016-03-24 00:04:23	Neocraftz1553	nah, then they'll never be seen again
2016-03-24 00:04:29	Neocraftz1553	but in the sector
2016-03-24 00:04:41	@Espyo	but if they're in the abyss sector, they fall down
2016-03-24 00:04:50	Neocraftz1553	instantly?
2016-03-24 00:05:00	Neocraftz1553	thats not.... hmmm....
2016-03-24 00:05:02	@Espyo	well, they fall for a second, then die
2016-03-24 00:05:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-24 00:05:14	@Espyo	oh wait
2016-03-24 00:05:17	@Espyo	I got it to happen
2016-03-24 00:05:24	Neocraftz1553	there you go
2016-03-24 00:05:24	@Espyo	wtf
2016-03-24 00:05:37	Neocraftz1553	awsome, huh
2016-03-24 00:05:53	@Espyo	off the top of my head, I can't understand why it happens
2016-03-24 00:06:06	Neocraftz1553	they're supposed to be dead
2016-03-24 00:06:07	Neocraftz1553	so
2016-03-24 00:06:19	Neocraftz1553	since they don't know wtf is going on
2016-03-24 00:06:32	Neocraftz1553	they run the hell outta there
2016-03-24 00:07:15	Neocraftz1553	but its fun when you've gott the whole area surrounded.inbottomless pits
2016-03-24 00:07:22	Neocraftz1553	then they all die
2016-03-24 00:07:28	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-24 00:07:42	ScruffyChat	Espyo, do bottomless pits need to be a lower height then the normal platforms?
2016-03-24 00:07:48	@Espyo	they should be
2016-03-24 00:07:48	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-24 00:07:53	@Espyo	I can expect nasty things if they're not
2016-03-24 00:07:59	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-24 00:08:03	Neocraftz1553	or else they... malfunction 
2016-03-24 00:08:28	@Espyo	oh, what likely happens is that the Pikmin, leaders, etc. are only considered to "fall into the void" if they land on the ground of an abyss sector
2016-03-24 00:08:36	ScruffyChat	Yeah

2016-03-24 00:08:39	@Espyo	if they walk from one sector to another without falling, they don't fall, so they don't land
2016-03-24 00:08:44	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-24 00:08:45	@Espyo	so they don't get killed
2016-03-24 00:08:50	ScruffyChat	Right, that's what's going on here
2016-03-24 00:08:52	ScruffyChat	So far
2016-03-24 00:08:56	Neocraftz1553	if you throw a pikmin onto it, though
2016-03-24 00:09:00	ScruffyChat	The platform and abyss are both 0
2016-03-24 00:09:03	Neocraftz1553	its a whole other story
2016-03-24 00:09:03	@Espyo	what, with the glitch me and Neo are talking about?
2016-03-24 00:09:07	@Espyo	or with a map you're making?
2016-03-24 00:09:12	ScruffyChat	A map I'm making
2016-03-24 00:09:15	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-24 00:09:29	@Espyo	I still want to play that one map you made

2016-03-24 00:10:04	ScruffyChat	I'm actually updating that one now that paths are available
2016-03-24 00:10:04	Neocraftz1553	I want to play it
2016-03-24 00:10:15	Neocraftz1553	especially with paths
2016-03-24 00:10:15	@Espyo	nice
2016-03-24 00:10:19	ScruffyChat	I designed it originally so that all items could be carried in straight lines

2016-03-24 00:10:34	Neocraftz1553	ah, like the clockwork chasm
2016-03-24 00:10:39	Neocraftz1553	in P3
2016-03-24 00:11:21	Neocraftz1553	you can add 1W links
2016-03-24 00:11:39	ScruffyChat	Can height be negative?
2016-03-24 00:11:48	Neocraftz1553	No...
2016-03-24 00:12:06	Neocraftz1553	try adding 100 to everything elses height
2016-03-24 00:12:51	Neocraftz1553	hey espyo, just a thought... for the pits
2016-03-24 00:13:02	Neocraftz1553	you know how there are shadows
2016-03-24 00:13:15	Neocraftz1553	well, why not add shadows to the pits...
2016-03-24 00:13:18	Neocraftz1553	but
2016-03-24 00:13:42	Neocraftz1553	shadows for cliffs, you know
2016-03-24 00:14:05	Neocraftz1553	a shadow with the texture of its neighbor
2016-03-24 00:14:21	Neocraftz1553	that way it looks like its a high ledge
2016-03-24 00:14:43	Neocraftz1553	descending down into the abyss
2016-03-24 00:15:36	Neocraftz1553	I probably worded it way more complicatedly than it could've been
2016-03-24 00:18:17	@Espyo	height can be negative
2016-03-24 00:18:21	Neocraftz1553	or "sides" to the neighboring sectors when there is a bottomless pit present
2016-03-24 00:18:24	Neocraftz1553	it van?
2016-03-24 00:18:27	@Espyo	sure
2016-03-24 00:18:30	@Espyo	no reason it shouldn't
2016-03-24 00:18:34	Neocraftz1553	didn't work for me
2016-03-24 00:18:37	@Espyo	...
2016-03-24 00:18:42	Neocraftz1553	then again....
2016-03-24 00:18:49	Neocraftz1553	 0.6
2016-03-24 00:19:27	@Espyo	let me try
2016-03-24 00:20:04	Neocraftz1553	version 0.6
2016-03-24 00:20:18	@Espyo	yeah, absolutely no problem in making negative heights
2016-03-24 00:20:24	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-24 00:20:43	Neocraftz1553	hey, did you get the suggestion?
2016-03-24 00:20:46	Neocraftz1553	espyo
2016-03-24 00:21:50	@Espyo	hmmmmmmmmmm
2016-03-24 00:21:52	@Espyo	I get what you mean
2016-03-24 00:22:00	@Espyo	I can give it a try
2016-03-24 00:22:03	@Espyo	but it might not work well
2016-03-24 00:22:08	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-24 00:22:12	@Espyo	it might give the idea that that's still part of the original sector or something
2016-03-24 00:22:23	@Espyo	plus if there's a background, it'll look weird
2016-03-24 00:22:29	Neocraftz1553	hmm....
2016-03-24 00:22:31	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-24 00:22:42	@Espyo	in fact, I tried a couple of ways to decorate the abyss when there's a background
2016-03-24 00:22:44	@Espyo	and none of them worked
2016-03-24 00:22:47	@Espyo	I guess I can try that one too
2016-03-24 00:23:24	Neocraftz1553	maybe make the sector just a black color...
2016-03-24 00:23:33	@Espyo	no, won't work to make the gradient
2016-03-24 00:23:39	@Espyo	it was a good idea on paper, but it fails
2016-03-24 00:23:41	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-24 00:23:48	@Espyo	it'll look like the floor sector is bleeding into the abyss sector
2016-03-24 00:23:50	Neocraftz1553	add fog?
2016-03-24 00:23:57	@Espyo	and that's if the abyss is black
2016-03-24 00:24:12	@Espyo	if there's a background, it just looks like the floor sector is fading into non-existence
2016-03-24 00:24:18	@Espyo	fog won't do much
2016-03-24 00:24:20	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 00:24:22	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-24 00:24:23	@Espyo	if the abyss is black, fog is pointless
2016-03-24 00:24:33	Neocraftz1553	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-03-24 00:24:37	@Espyo	if it's a background, well, you can always make the background foggy yourself
2016-03-24 00:24:41	Neocraftz1553	this is pretty hard
2016-03-24 00:24:43	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-24 00:24:46	Neocraftz1553	true,..
2016-03-24 00:24:47	@Espyo	but we can leave it as it is for now
2016-03-24 00:24:53	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-24 00:25:01	@Espyo	if the abyss is black, I guess you can expect the player to know better than to let Pikmin fall
2016-03-24 00:25:13	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-03-24 00:25:15	@Espyo	if it's a background, then as you move around, the camera should show the background move far away
2016-03-24 00:25:20	@Espyo	so it should be obvious that that's a big fall down
2016-03-24 00:25:29	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-24 00:25:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah, i've tried it out with this map; distance gets the point across
2016-03-24 00:25:34	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-24 00:25:38	@Espyo	right
2016-03-24 00:25:55	Neocraftz1553	how do you add a background into the actual map
2016-03-24 00:26:01	Neocraftz1553	gameplay wise
2016-03-24 00:26:22	@Espyo	on the area's Data.txt file
2016-03-24 00:26:26	@Espyo	there are parameters for the background
2016-03-24 00:26:29	@Espyo	they should be straight-forward
2016-03-24 00:26:33	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-24 00:26:37	Neocraftz1553	ooooh
2016-03-24 00:26:39	@Espyo	well, there are if you added them
2016-03-24 00:26:39	Neocraftz1553	oooooooh
2016-03-24 00:26:42	@Espyo	if not, check the wiki
2016-03-24 00:26:49	Neocraftz1553	I thought it was forthe guide
2016-03-24 00:27:19	@Espyo	yeah, that's what the problem was in 0.6
2016-03-24 00:27:24	@Espyo	they were both called "background"
2016-03-24 00:27:30	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-24 00:27:34	@Espyo	now, the gameplay background, what you see in the distance, is BACKGROUND
2016-03-24 00:27:42	@Espyo	the drawing that orients you when making maps is the GUIDE
2016-03-24 00:27:46	@Espyo	no more confusion
2016-03-24 00:27:52	Neocraftz1553	and guide is guide
2016-03-24 00:28:03	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-24 00:28:20	Neocraftz1553	whats background color for?
2016-03-24 00:29:41	ScruffyChat	if you just want to make the background a solid color instead of an image
2016-03-24 00:29:57	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-24 00:30:06	Neocraftz1553	do I replace it?

2016-03-24 00:31:25	@Espyo	if you want
2016-03-24 00:31:52	Neocraftz1553	so I put BACKGROUND = TEST
2016-03-24 00:32:11	ScruffyChat	Oh, one other fix that might be difficult but very worth it when working on a big area
2016-03-24 00:32:27	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-03-24 00:32:43	ScruffyChat	If no objects are using a texture or if it isn't recognized, it no longer shows up in the suggestions
2016-03-24 00:32:58	Neocraftz1553	ah, yeah
2016-03-24 00:33:04	ScruffyChat	If you implement that you'd have a better suggestion menu feature than Blender does
2016-03-24 00:33:13	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 00:33:31	Neocraftz1553	its convinient
2016-03-24 00:33:39	Neocraftz1553	blender copies textures tho

2016-03-24 00:34:10	@Espyo	wait, the two of your are confusing me
2016-03-24 00:34:13	@Espyo	with your respective messages

2016-03-24 00:34:28	ScruffyChat	Sorry; Neo, you first
2016-03-24 00:34:36	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: the parameters you need to use are listed on the wiki
2016-03-24 00:34:46	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-24 00:34:52	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: if no objects are using a texture?
2016-03-24 00:35:08	Neocraftz1553	sectors
2016-03-24 00:35:14	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-24 00:35:32	@Espyo	well, sure
2016-03-24 00:35:38	@Espyo	I can make it not include the ERROR textures on the list
2016-03-24 00:35:51	@Espyo	I made it do so because well...
2016-03-24 00:35:59	@Espyo	well, simply because I didn't make it NOT do that
2016-03-24 00:36:29	Neocraftz1553	can I get the link...
2016-03-24 00:36:32	@Espyo	although, remember that the less you use a texture, the further down it goes on the list
2016-03-24 00:36:39	Neocraftz1553	parameters
2016-03-24 00:36:41	@Espyo	so if you have an ERROR texture, you can just ignore it and it'll die on its own
2016-03-24 00:36:58	Neocraftz1553	RIP
2016-03-24 00:37:06	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_fangame_engine/Creating_areas#Optional_parameters
2016-03-24 00:37:08	ScruffyChat	Well the weird thing is I've taken textures out of the /Textures folder, and the texture suggestion menu still shows them
2016-03-24 00:37:16	@Espyo	oh, that's what you meant
2016-03-24 00:37:23	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2016-03-24 00:37:36	@Espyo	well, the second you add a new texture to the list, it grabs the file, creates a thumbnail, and then closes the file
2016-03-24 00:37:40	@Espyo	and keeps the thumb in memory
2016-03-24 00:37:42	@Espyo	so it makes sense
2016-03-24 00:37:54	@Espyo	I could make it refresh every time you open the list
2016-03-24 00:37:55	ScruffyChat	Ah, that does make sense
2016-03-24 00:38:04	@Espyo	but... just how common would it be for the user to delete textures mid-flight?
2016-03-24 00:38:12	ScruffyChat	True
2016-03-24 00:38:12	@Espyo	adding them, maybe, but deleting...
2016-03-24 00:38:16	ScruffyChat	I guess that's just me
2016-03-24 00:38:21	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 00:38:30	@Espyo	it'd just add more work on my end, and I can see those kind of things being glitch-prone
2016-03-24 00:38:35	Neocraftz1553	I have textures I don't even use there
2016-03-24 00:38:37	ScruffyChat	True
2016-03-24 00:38:38	@Espyo	heck, Neo's getting these crashes, and I bet it's because of just that
2016-03-24 00:38:51	@Espyo	this thumbnail creation business probably has something that I missed, which is causing the crashes
2016-03-24 00:39:05	@Espyo	if you don't use a texture, it'll never show up on the suggestions
2016-03-24 00:39:13	Neocraftz1553	gtg
2016-03-24 00:39:16	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-24 00:39:16	@Espyo	see ya
2016-03-24 00:39:39	ScruffyChat	Bye
2016-03-24 00:39:56	@Espyo	but should I still make the list not include ERROR textures?
2016-03-24 00:40:08	@Espyo	on one hand, I should make it so that they never go into the list, because they're typos
2016-03-24 00:40:31	@Espyo	on the other, if you want a lot of your sectors to use a texture you don't have yet, you don't want to either type it all the time by hand or place the texture now
2016-03-24 00:40:46	@Espyo	although that's not as common
2016-03-24 00:40:56	@Espyo	although it's also important the player knows that a previous texture they wrote is giving an error
2016-03-24 00:41:03	@Espyo	...there's no right answer
2016-03-24 00:41:23	@Espyo	well, when there's no right answer, here's the right answer: leave it as is and keep going
2016-03-24 00:42:16	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-24 00:42:24	ScruffyChat	It works fine, and really I don't mind it
2016-03-24 00:42:59	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-24 00:43:09	@Espyo	if in the future there's a better idea, I can implement it

2016-03-24 11:24:31	Testyo	Greetings everyone!
2016-03-24 11:26:57	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-03-24 11:26:57	Testyo	yeah, I think there's probably a paradox for that broken
2016-03-24 11:27:28	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-24 11:31:27	Yoshi2	ok, I looked a bit more into the scripting language and I'm pretty sure it is a piece of crap
2016-03-24 11:31:31	Yoshi2	http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=MexScript
2016-03-24 11:32:55	Yoshi2	here is the foundation of the thing that makes it work: http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=MexScript#Log
2016-03-24 11:34:07	Yoshi2	I don't see any way to edit the archive directly by code
2016-03-24 11:35:07	Yoshi2	which means that if resources depend on variables in several spots in the file, you can forget about using this script language to edit stuff
2016-03-24 11:35:43	Yoshi2	I COULD make it read stuff, probably, but it would be a pain because this language is pretty limited
2016-03-24 11:35:57	Yoshi2	no functions, so the code would be a mess
2016-03-24 11:36:56	Yoshi2	and downloading the program requires putting in an address, and as soon as I put in my throwaway address, I received spam mail
2016-03-24 11:48:29	@Espyo	bleh
2016-03-24 11:48:30	@Espyo	good grief
2016-03-24 11:50:50	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as AFKazooie
2016-03-24 11:50:50	Yoshi2	there is another Game Extractor program I saw, which you need to pay money for if you want to edit archives
2016-03-24 11:51:05	Yoshi2	and I couldn't even find any docs on how to write plugins for that one
2016-03-24 11:51:30	Yoshi2	soo, I guess it would be easier if I learned how to do GUIs
2016-03-24 11:52:45	Yoshi2	and better for users who would want to extract stuff from BW
2016-03-24 11:53:05	Yoshi2	because it saves them money and/or removes the risk of spam mails

2016-03-24 15:14:04	@Espyo	:|
2016-03-24 15:14:13	@Espyo	there's not much point in upload glitch images if I'll fix the glitches in a few days
2016-03-24 15:14:24	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-03-24 15:14:57	Neocraftz1553	I don't see a glitch...
2016-03-24 15:15:09	Neocraftz1553	but the area looks so damn cool
2016-03-24 15:15:12	@Espyo	Scruffy did tell me about some weirdness yesterday
2016-03-24 15:15:15	@Espyo	but I can't see the glitch either...
2016-03-24 15:15:17	@Espyo	he'll have to explain
2016-03-24 15:15:20	@Espyo	and yeah, it looks incredible
2016-03-24 15:15:34	@Espyo	anyway, I fixed the Pikmin twirling glitch
2016-03-24 15:15:42	@Espyo	it was a combination of factors that made it happen
2016-03-24 15:15:44	@Espyo	kinda interesting
2016-03-24 15:15:52	Neocraftz1553	oh, I see what it is
2016-03-24 15:15:57	Klemen702	i'm suprised how creative scruffy is
2016-03-24 15:16:03	@Espyo	for one thing, objects can go up sectors 50 units higher than they are, like a staircase
2016-03-24 15:16:06	Klemen702	i coudn't even come up with a map like the one in that pic
2016-03-24 15:16:10	@Espyo	so that's why the Pikmin were able to get back on land even though they fell
2016-03-24 15:16:28	@Espyo	secondly, there's some REALLY iffy code that makes Pikmin face the leaders if they're not doing anything
2016-03-24 15:16:37	@Espyo	problem is that it was also making them face the leader if they're in mid-air
2016-03-24 15:16:39	@Espyo	again, iffy code
2016-03-24 15:16:45	Neocraftz1553	The background looks level with the ground...
2016-03-24 15:16:49	@Espyo	and while facing the leaders, they rotate their body, which controls their movement
2016-03-24 15:16:53	@Espyo	leading to them circling backwards
2016-03-24 15:17:00	@Espyo	I fixed it all, and it should be a lot more stable
2016-03-24 15:17:12	Neocraftz1553	I see...
2016-03-24 15:17:17	@Espyo	it does look leveled, yeah
2016-03-24 15:17:21	@Espyo	but there's nothing I can do about that
2016-03-24 15:17:29	Neocraftz1553	so thats, what, 3 glitches fixed
2016-03-24 15:17:33	@Espyo	although when you make the background image, I suppose you should give it some blurriness
2016-03-24 15:17:34	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-03-24 15:17:38	@Espyo	more like 6

2016-03-24 15:17:44	Neocraftz1553	true

2016-03-24 15:17:54	@Espyo	phooee
2016-03-24 15:18:41	Yoshi2	each time you kill a glitch, another will rise
2016-03-24 15:18:44	Neocraftz1553	the next update got sprayed in bug spray
2016-03-24 15:18:48	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-24 15:18:52	Neocraftz1553	rule of thumb
2016-03-24 15:19:08	Neocraftz1553	no game is 100% perfect
2016-03-24 15:19:18	Neocraftz1553	glitch-wise
2016-03-24 15:19:46	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-24 15:19:53	Klemen702	if you make a game that is just a black screen
2016-03-24 15:19:56	@Espyo	there are glitches that I know of that I'll keep
2016-03-24 15:19:57	Klemen702	the game will have no glitches
2016-03-24 15:20:02	@Espyo	either because they're too impossible to fix
2016-03-24 15:20:02	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 15:20:04	@Espyo	or because they're harmless
2016-03-24 15:20:07	Neocraftz1553	the perfect game
2016-03-24 15:20:22	@Espyo	and even then, I can expect that black screen game to crash on some operative systems
2016-03-24 15:20:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah... for some reason or another 
2016-03-24 15:20:47	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-24 15:20:52	Klemen702	shit
2016-03-24 15:20:52	Testyo	I hope you've vented off your anger by swearing, friend.
2016-03-24 15:21:00	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 15:21:05	Klemen702	althrough i'm not sure if it really is a glitch
2016-03-24 15:21:05	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm
2016-03-24 15:21:06	Testyo	I said I hope you've vented off your anger by swearing, friend. because Klemen702 said a swear word.
2016-03-24 15:21:25	Neocraftz1553	wierd...
2016-03-24 15:21:42	Neocraftz1553	Testyo didn't say that yesterday
2016-03-24 15:21:43	Testyo	is it looks okay to me
2016-03-24 15:21:48	Klemen702	i don't count shit as a swear word lol
2016-03-24 15:21:48	Testyo	We should clean your mouth with soap!
2016-03-24 15:21:59	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-03-24 15:22:08	Klemen702	i would die
2016-03-24 15:22:18	Klemen702	testyo wishes me death
2016-03-24 15:22:18	Testyo	J: how does this sound they'll see two wikis
2016-03-24 15:22:18	Neocraftz1553	when Espyo swore...
2016-03-24 15:22:21	Klemen702	confirmed
2016-03-24 15:22:29	Neocraftz1553	but then again...
2016-03-24 15:22:41	Neocraftz1553	Espyo did make Testyo...
2016-03-24 15:22:41	Testyo	If they bite you in the arms or fuel tank
2016-03-24 15:23:58	@Espyo	he only says it some times
2016-03-24 15:24:05	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure I lowered the chances to like one in a million
2016-03-24 15:24:18	Neocraftz1553	or everytime klemen says something
2016-03-24 15:24:26	@Espyo	but Testyo must be mocking me, since it looks like it's 999999 in a million
2016-03-24 15:24:26	Testyo	I'd be more interested in finding out how Pikmin numbers affect the speed at which bridges are built and such
2016-03-24 15:24:29	Neocraftz1553	let me see...
2016-03-24 15:24:39	Neocraftz1553	Fuck it
2016-03-24 15:24:46	Klemen702	fuck
2016-03-24 15:24:46	Testyo	You swear like a sailor.
2016-03-24 15:24:48	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-03-24 15:24:52	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-03-24 15:24:52	Klemen702	testyo only bashes me
2016-03-24 15:24:53	Testyo	the name of the property separate your code be OS-dependent?
2016-03-24 15:25:09	@Espyo	there we go, a twofer
2016-03-24 15:25:18	@Espyo	I fixed Pikmin walking off the edge and circling back around
2016-03-24 15:25:24	@Espyo	and also fixed Pikmin randomly walking in circles
2016-03-24 15:25:29	Neocraftz1553	so they die
2016-03-24 15:25:37	@Espyo	they go where you tell them
2016-03-24 15:25:40	@Espyo	if you tell them to go into the abyss
2016-03-24 15:25:47	Neocraftz1553	they do
2016-03-24 15:25:50	@Espyo	they actually go now instead of coming back to you and defying physics
2016-03-24 15:25:50	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-03-24 15:25:55	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 15:26:04	Klemen702	so with that bug fix
2016-03-24 15:26:07	Klemen702	you are causing more deaths
2016-03-24 15:26:22	Neocraftz1553	the don't want to listen to your commands
2016-03-24 15:26:28	Neocraftz1553	to die
2016-03-24 15:26:35	Neocraftz1553	but in the update...
2016-03-24 15:26:45	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-24 15:27:03	@Espyo	hey Neo, did you ever manage to recreate the "leaders refuse to pluck" glitch?
2016-03-24 15:27:12	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-24 15:27:21	Neocraftz1553	got the state
2016-03-24 15:27:35	Neocraftz1553	state: going_to_pluck
2016-03-24 15:27:50	Neocraftz1553	with Olimar
2016-03-24 15:28:00	Neocraftz1553	two Olimars on field
2016-03-24 15:28:04	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-24 15:28:05	@Espyo	wait what
2016-03-24 15:28:11	@Espyo	what do you mean two Olimars on the field
2016-03-24 15:28:14	Neocraftz1553	but one refused to pluck
2016-03-24 15:28:28	Neocraftz1553	two Olimar Leader objects
2016-03-24 15:28:56	@Espyo	can that happen without there being two Olimars?
2016-03-24 15:28:57	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User account The Iron Golem created http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User:The_Iron_Golem
2016-03-24 15:28:57	Neocraftz1553	you can put 20 Olimars for the hell of it...
2016-03-24 15:29:04	@Espyo	it shouldn't make a difference... but I'm scared if it does
2016-03-24 15:29:15	Neocraftz1553	hm....
2016-03-24 15:29:22	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure...
2016-03-24 15:29:36	@Espyo	does it always happen?
2016-03-24 15:29:38	Neocraftz1553	last time I had two Olimars and a Louie on field...
2016-03-24 15:29:42	Neocraftz1553	no not always
2016-03-24 15:30:52	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-24 15:31:00	@Espyo	did you manage to find a pattern on how to get it to happen?
2016-03-24 15:31:28	Neocraftz1553	uh....
2016-03-24 15:31:36	Neocraftz1553	no, not really...
2016-03-24 15:31:43	@Espyo	drat
2016-03-24 15:31:51	Neocraftz1553	I COULD try to recreate yesterday...
2016-03-24 15:32:08	Neocraftz1553	swarming pikmin into the abyss for the heck of it...
2016-03-24 15:33:16	@Espyo	so, going_to_pluck, was it?
2016-03-24 15:33:29	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-24 15:33:43	@Espyo	did you...
2016-03-24 15:33:47	@Espyo	a) let that leader get hurt?
2016-03-24 15:33:52	@Espyo	b) let that leader fall into a pit?
2016-03-24 15:33:55	@Espyo	c) switch away from that leader?
2016-03-24 15:34:18	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-24 15:34:26	Neocraftz1553	not c...
2016-03-24 15:34:34	Neocraftz1553	probably a or b...
2016-03-24 15:34:38	@Espyo	:|
2016-03-24 15:34:47	@Espyo	are you just creating the craziest scenario possible to get glitches to happen?
2016-03-24 15:34:47	Neocraftz1553	definately b, but he could still pluck...
2016-03-24 15:35:04	Neocraftz1553	I'm not even sure at this point
2016-03-24 15:35:08	@Espyo	|:
2016-03-24 15:35:22	Neocraftz1553	nah, just kidding
2016-03-24 15:35:29	@Espyo	._.
2016-03-24 15:35:31	Neocraftz1553	it happened on two maps, so....
2016-03-24 15:35:40	Neocraftz1553	.-.
2016-03-24 15:35:43	@Espyo	so none of the three?
2016-03-24 15:35:48	@Espyo	yeah, that face was the next step
2016-03-24 15:35:56	Neocraftz1553	probably...
2016-03-24 15:35:59	Neocraftz1553	a or b
2016-03-24 15:36:26	@Espyo	what about the leader getting hurt WHILE going to the seed, or falling into the abyss WHILE going to the seed?
2016-03-24 15:36:53	Neocraftz1553	probably that...
2016-03-24 15:37:09	@Espyo	so you let one of these happen?
2016-03-24 15:37:23	Neocraftz1553	wait, whistle the leader on the other side of the abyss where his spawn point is
2016-03-24 15:37:37	Neocraftz1553	he keeps walking into it until he dies
2016-03-24 15:37:50	@Espyo	well, makes sense  that that happens
2016-03-24 15:37:54	@Espyo	he respawns, continues trying to come to you
2016-03-24 15:37:58	@Espyo	repeats
2016-03-24 15:38:01	Neocraftz1553	then he'll just do a walk animation in the abyss
2016-03-24 15:38:15	Neocraftz1553	and something hilarious...
2016-03-24 15:38:15	@Espyo	leader death isn't really implemented, so
2016-03-24 15:38:37	Neocraftz1553	the Twilight spectralid can shake you ridiculously far...
2016-03-24 15:38:48	Neocraftz1553	and if you have abysses around...
2016-03-24 15:39:32	@Espyo	so when Olimar was stuck going_to_pluck, could you do anything at all to unstuck him?
2016-03-24 15:39:41	Neocraftz1553	move...
2016-03-24 15:39:47	Neocraftz1553	cancel the pluck...
2016-03-24 15:39:59	Neocraftz1553	like a normal pluck, exept without
2016-03-24 15:40:02	Neocraftz1553	actually
2016-03-24 15:40:04	Neocraftz1553	plucking
2016-03-24 15:40:13	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-03-24 15:40:23	@Espyo	when he was stuck, was he close to the Pikmin?
2016-03-24 15:40:36	Neocraftz1553	on top of a sprouted one...
2016-03-24 15:40:45	Neocraftz1553	had a squad of 15...
2016-03-24 15:40:52	Neocraftz1553	wait...
2016-03-24 15:41:01	Neocraftz1553	when these happened...
2016-03-24 15:41:22	Neocraftz1553	they all happened as soon as the area loaded...
2016-03-24 15:41:38	Neocraftz1553	so I had to restart the maps
2016-03-24 15:41:48	Neocraftz1553	they happen in the play map too, I think...
2016-03-24 15:41:52	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-03-24 15:42:02	@Espyo	so right on top of a seed?
2016-03-24 15:43:03	@Espyo	really can't recreate the glitch
2016-03-24 15:43:49	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-24 15:43:58	Neocraftz1553	oh, Bfore he plucked it
2016-03-24 15:44:18	Neocraftz1553	he was going normally to the seed
2016-03-24 15:44:31	Neocraftz1553	right clicked NEAR the sed
2016-03-24 15:45:08	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-24 15:45:19	@Espyo	so you right-clicked to cancel the pluck
2016-03-24 15:45:24	@Espyo	and Olimar was still in the going_to_pluck state
2016-03-24 15:45:28	@Espyo	that it?
2016-03-24 15:45:34	@Espyo	you're telling a lot of different stories...
2016-03-24 15:45:43	Neocraftz1553	no x.x
2016-03-24 15:45:57	@Espyo	maybe it's best if you just play normally, and the next time the glitch happens, you quickly tell me
2016-03-24 15:46:00	Neocraftz1553	I right clicked to pluck like normal
2016-03-24 15:46:03	@Espyo	if I'm not online, write it in a sheet of paper or something
2016-03-24 15:46:05	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-24 15:46:09	@Espyo	but plucking is with the left click, not right click :|
2016-03-24 15:46:10	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-24 15:46:16	@Espyo	unless you remapped it
2016-03-24 15:46:18	Neocraftz1553	ooooooooooooooooooh
2016-03-24 15:46:30	Neocraftz1553	I confuse mouse buttons...
2016-03-24 15:46:47	Neocraftz1553	I'm right handed, therefore, right biased
2016-03-24 15:47:12	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-24 15:47:25	@Espyo	well, next time you get that glitch to happen or the area editor texture crash glitch, let me know right away
2016-03-24 15:47:36	@Espyo	and give me as much info as  you can about what you were doing
2016-03-24 15:47:43	@Espyo	and what the state of things was and all
2016-03-24 15:47:44	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-24 15:47:50	Neocraftz1553	sounds good
2016-03-24 15:49:51	Neocraftz1553	shrinking Olimar.. glitch
2016-03-24 15:50:26	Neocraftz1553	fall into an abyss from a height 700...
2016-03-24 15:50:35	Neocraftz1553	and the abyss -10500
2016-03-24 15:50:39	Neocraftz1553	thereyou go
2016-03-24 15:52:03	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-24 15:52:18	@Espyo	stuff gets smaller and bigger the higher and lower it is
2016-03-24 15:52:21	@Espyo	so it makes sense
2016-03-24 15:52:35	@Espyo	it used to be more noticeable, but it looked bad
2016-03-24 15:53:36	Neocraftz1553	and if you put -15000 they get negative smaller...
2016-03-24 15:53:42	Neocraftz1553	meaning they get bigger
2016-03-24 15:53:46	@Espyo	:|
2016-03-24 15:53:50	@Espyo	that part wasn't very intended
2016-03-24 15:53:54	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-24 15:54:06	Neocraftz1553	its just the engine working out negativea
2016-03-24 15:54:13	Neocraftz1553	*negatives
2016-03-24 15:55:34	@Espyo	I'll fix it some day so that it doesn't go overboard
2016-03-24 15:55:43	Neocraftz1553	hey
2016-03-24 15:55:59	Neocraftz1553	what if I do a video on a bunch of glitches that I have found
2016-03-24 15:56:49	@Espyo	well, if you can have video footage of what you were doing when this or that glitch happened, that'd be great
2016-03-24 15:56:51	@Espyo	so go ahead
2016-03-24 15:59:43	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-24 15:59:57	Neocraftz1553	got uh... 3...4ish glitches
2016-03-24 16:00:02	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-24 16:01:50	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-24 16:03:13	Neocraftz1553	guess I'll cut out this...
2016-03-24 16:03:26	Neocraftz1553	parts that don't really contribute to the glitches...

2016-03-24 17:43:25	ScruffyChat	Hi everybody!
2016-03-24 17:44:41	ScruffyChat	Espyo, did you see the screenshot of PFE I uploaded?
2016-03-24 17:44:48	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-24 17:44:54	@Espyo	I did... but couldn't understand the problem
2016-03-24 17:45:02	@Espyo	I remember us talking about it last night
2016-03-24 17:45:08	@Espyo	but even then I couldn't really tell what was up
2016-03-24 17:45:39	ScruffyChat	For some reason that strange shadow shape of the background stretches across the screen
2016-03-24 17:45:54	ScruffyChat	The further to the right you travel, the more it is stretched from the left
2016-03-24 17:46:08	ScruffyChat	So in the screenshot I was pretty far to the right
2016-03-24 17:46:12	@Espyo	"strange shadow shape"...
2016-03-24 17:46:36	ScruffyChat	The big triangle in the background
2016-03-24 17:47:01	ScruffyChat	it might have something to do with how the background parallax is programmed
2016-03-24 17:47:05	@Espyo	oh, that one that's miscolored
2016-03-24 17:47:36	@Espyo	okay, lemme know what your bg_ parameters are on Data.txt
2016-03-24 17:48:07	ScruffyChat	The image (under bg_bmp) is called Crate Planks.png
2016-03-24 17:48:16	ScruffyChat	bg_dist = 2
2016-03-24 17:48:34	@Espyo	what are the texture's dimensions? I smell like the problem could be coming from there
2016-03-24 17:48:47	ScruffyChat	True
2016-03-24 17:48:54	@Espyo	zoom at 1, color at 0 0 0, then?
2016-03-24 17:49:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I just didn't include them in Data.txt
2016-03-24 17:49:10	@Espyo	right
2016-03-24 17:49:14	@Espyo	those... SHOULD be the defaults
2016-03-24 17:49:18	ScruffyChat	uh oh, the dimensions are 1095 × 730
2016-03-24 17:49:21	@Espyo	now I'm wondering if they're not
2016-03-24 17:49:23	@Espyo	okay, sounds good
2016-03-24 17:49:35	@Espyo	one more thing, can you see that weird effect all the time? or do you need to zoom in/out in-game?
2016-03-24 17:50:03	ScruffyChat	Zooming out diminishes the effect, zooming in intensifies it
2016-03-24 17:50:11	ScruffyChat	And it doesn't happen every time I open the area
2016-03-24 17:50:27	ScruffyChat	Maybe once every 2 or 3 times
2016-03-24 17:50:27	@Espyo	that's the real scary part
2016-03-24 17:50:49	@Espyo	if you just keep quitting/entering over and over, do you get it eventually?
2016-03-24 17:50:57	@Espyo	or does it just appear or disappear randomly according to changes you make in the editor?
2016-03-24 17:52:11	ScruffyChat	If I keep quitting/entering over and over I get it eventually
2016-03-24 17:52:30	@Espyo	okay, good
2016-03-24 17:52:31	@Espyo	here goes...
2016-03-24 17:53:35	@Espyo	by "more to the right", do you mean east from the origin?
2016-03-24 17:53:41	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-03-24 17:53:42	@Espyo	the origin is represented on the editor with a cyan cross
2016-03-24 17:53:45	@Espyo	okay, that's great
2016-03-24 17:55:22	@Espyo	how far are we talking here? a 5-second walk, or a 1-minute walk?
2016-03-24 17:55:33	ScruffyChat	it took about 10 seconds
2016-03-24 17:55:38	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-24 17:55:59	ScruffyChat	I started noticing the effect about 300 from the origin actually
2016-03-24 17:56:03	ScruffyChat	to the east
2016-03-24 17:56:28	@Espyo	all right
2016-03-24 17:56:36	@Espyo	I'm starting to fear that this may be one of those Wine problems
2016-03-24 17:56:41	@Espyo	like JPG textures acting up
2016-03-24 17:56:46	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2016-03-24 17:56:49	ScruffyChat	Oh, that reminds me
2016-03-24 17:57:08	ScruffyChat	The title screen background is a jpg, I can't see it when I boot the engine
2016-03-24 17:57:48	@Espyo	yeah, you said before
2016-03-24 17:57:55	@Espyo	I'm afraid I have to leave it as JPG; it's massive as PNG
2016-03-24 17:58:02	ScruffyChat	Ah okay, no problem
2016-03-24 17:58:05	@Espyo	I COULD however...
2016-03-24 17:58:10	@Espyo	make it customizable
2016-03-24 17:58:13	@Espyo	have no fixed filenames
2016-03-24 17:58:23	@Espyo	and if you want to specify a file, you set it on Config.txt
2016-03-24 17:58:37	@Espyo	I should probably do that
2016-03-24 17:58:41	@Espyo	fixed file names are always a problem
2016-03-24 18:00:08	@Espyo	I can't really get it to happen...
2016-03-24 18:00:19	@Espyo	can you do the following:
2016-03-24 18:00:19	ScruffyChat	hmm
2016-03-24 18:00:27	@Espyo	create a new image, same dimensions, but color it in a solid color
2016-03-24 18:00:37	@Espyo	so we're on the same page, use #9ec4a9
2016-03-24 18:00:57	@Espyo	and on top of that, on the area's Data.txt, include bg_zoom = 1.00, and bg_color = 0 0 0
2016-03-24 18:01:04	@Espyo	also set the bg_dist to 2.00 instead of just 2
2016-03-24 18:01:19	@Espyo	I doubt that it's finding a problem reading the number, but we have to be sure
2016-03-24 18:01:24	@Espyo	might as well tackle all scenarios at once
2016-03-24 18:01:32	@Espyo	so that if none of these are the answer, we'll know right away
2016-03-24 18:01:34	@Espyo	instead of trying one by one
2016-03-24 18:01:43	@Espyo	oh, also
2016-03-24 18:01:49	@Espyo	try creating a simple test area for this
2016-03-24 18:02:00	@Espyo	MAYBE it could have something to do with your area's geometry? I doubt it, though
2016-03-24 18:09:35	ScruffyChat	No problems yet
2016-03-24 18:09:53	ScruffyChat	Although, I worry I won't be able to see the glitch because it's a solid color
2016-03-24 18:10:16	ScruffyChat	If I checkerboard it or something, it'd be easier to spot if it happens
2016-03-24 18:11:17	ScruffyChat	Wait never mind, I can see it
2016-03-24 18:11:23	@Espyo	welp
2016-03-24 18:11:28	@Espyo	is it faint?
2016-03-24 18:11:54	ScruffyChat	Yes, pretty faint
2016-03-24 18:12:06	@Espyo	and it's pretty noticeable with that wood texture you sent me?
2016-03-24 18:12:07	@Espyo	how weird
2016-03-24 18:12:09	@Espyo	uh
2016-03-24 18:12:11	@Espyo	let's rewind
2016-03-24 18:12:18	@Espyo	and it's pretty noticeable with the wood texture on the screenshot?
2016-03-24 18:12:20	@Espyo	how weird
2016-03-24 18:12:27	@Espyo	NOW comes the "sent me" part
2016-03-24 18:12:33	@Espyo	can you send me the texture? :V
2016-03-24 18:12:36	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-03-24 18:13:19	ScruffyChat	https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0b8g6oms0oa11r/Crate%20Planks.png?dl=0
2016-03-24 18:13:48	@Espyo	great, thanks
2016-03-24 18:17:00	@Espyo	doesn't the Y matter too?
2016-03-24 18:17:06	@Espyo	it looks like it does, from the screenshot
2016-03-24 18:18:43	ScruffyChat	Not really, only the x seems to change it
2016-03-24 18:18:50	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-24 18:20:00	ScruffyChat	Also this doesn't seem to happen west of the origin, only east
2016-03-24 18:20:11	@Espyo	right
2016-03-24 18:20:16	@Espyo	well, I'm not having any luck
2016-03-24 18:20:27	@Espyo	can you tinker with bg_dist to see if it changes anything?
2016-03-24 18:20:33	ScruffyChat	Sure
2016-03-24 18:20:41	@Espyo	thanks
2016-03-24 18:20:44	ScruffyChat	What happens if you set it to 0?
2016-03-24 18:20:53	@Espyo	should look like it belongs to ground level
2016-03-24 18:21:13	@Espyo	...negative numbers should look fun
2016-03-24 18:21:49	ScruffyChat	Still happens at 0
2016-03-24 18:22:04	ScruffyChat	Although the triangle appears to be further zoomed in, like the texture
2016-03-24 18:22:13	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-03-24 18:22:20	@Espyo	what about if you change the texture's dimensions?
2016-03-24 18:22:32	@Espyo	may want to make a backup of everything, with all these changes going around...
2016-03-24 18:22:50	@Espyo	okay, negative dist value is definitely fun
2016-03-24 18:22:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-24 18:22:55	@Espyo	messes with your mind
2016-03-24 18:22:59	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-24 18:23:02	ScruffyChat	I'll have to try it
2016-03-24 18:23:11	ScruffyChat	But first, what dimensions do you suggest?
2016-03-24 18:23:29	@Espyo	a quarter of what it is
2016-03-24 18:23:34	@Espyo	to see if it appears 4 times sooner or later
2016-03-24 18:23:46	@Espyo	...don't set the dist to 0
2016-03-24 18:23:53	@Espyo	or if you do
2016-03-24 18:23:54	@Espyo	don't move
2016-03-24 18:23:58	@Espyo	you could get a seizure
2016-03-24 18:24:00	@Espyo	I'm not even joking
2016-03-24 18:24:09	@Espyo	if you're seizure-prone, don't do it
2016-03-24 18:24:33	ScruffyChat	Oh shoot
2016-03-24 18:24:44	@Espyo	oh okay, setting it to ONE is the one that makes it look like it belongs to ground level
2016-03-24 18:24:50	ScruffyChat	For me I had it at 0 with a solid color so I didn't notice anythign
2016-03-24 18:24:55	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-24 18:25:50	ScruffyChat	The triangle still appears, with the same resolution
2016-03-24 18:25:59	ScruffyChat	So it's not an issue with the texture...
2016-03-24 18:26:14	ScruffyChat	Unless the proportion of the dimensions is off
2016-03-24 18:26:29	@Espyo	nuts
2016-03-24 18:26:57	ScruffyChat	Let me try a square image
2016-03-24 18:27:01	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-24 18:27:54	ScruffyChat	Shoot I forgot, background images go in Graphics, not Textures
2016-03-24 18:28:05	@Espyo	they can go in Textures too
2016-03-24 18:28:09	@Espyo	they SHOULD, actually
2016-03-24 18:28:14	ScruffyChat	I tried to use Grass_light.png as a background and got the error texture
2016-03-24 18:28:23	@Espyo	anyway, you just have to prepend "Textures/" before the filename on bg_dist
2016-03-24 18:28:34	ScruffyChat	ah
2016-03-24 18:28:41	ScruffyChat	The triangle still appears over the error texture
2016-03-24 18:29:05	ScruffyChat	It seems to be a stretched out, reversed image of the error texture
2016-03-24 18:29:16	@Espyo	hmmmmmm...
2016-03-24 18:29:24	@Espyo	appears just as soon and all?
2016-03-24 18:29:30	ScruffyChat	as though the background is a big piece of rubber and someone is pulling one of the corners to the right as you walk right
2016-03-24 18:29:33	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-03-24 18:29:39	@Espyo	okay, try this
2016-03-24 18:29:46	@Espyo	try setting your game resolution to the biggest size possible
2016-03-24 18:29:49	@Espyo	so... your screen size
2016-03-24 18:29:55	@Espyo	any more than that might cause problems :|
2016-03-24 18:30:00	@Espyo	and tell me if it still appears just as early
2016-03-24 18:32:32	ScruffyChat	Aha, it takes about twice as long at my screen size, 1280 * 800
2016-03-24 18:32:48	@Espyo	hm, that's promising
2016-03-24 18:33:16	@Espyo	but since I can't recreate it, all I'm left with is looking at the code to see what I can find
2016-03-24 18:33:27	@Espyo	...past me left this comment:
2016-03-24 18:33:29	@Espyo	/Not gonna lie, this uses some fancy-shnancy numbers.
2016-03-24 18:33:30	@Espyo	            //I mostly got here via trial and error.
2016-03-24 18:33:30	@Espyo	            //I apologize if you're trying to understand what it means.
2016-03-24 18:33:30	@Espyo	            
2016-03-24 18:33:35	@Espyo	that can ONLY be a good sign

2016-03-24 18:34:27	ScruffyChat	wooooah
2016-03-24 18:34:36	ScruffyChat	I set grass_light to the bg_bmp
2016-03-24 18:34:52	ScruffyChat	But forgot grass_light was also the texture for the platfrom
2016-03-24 18:35:00	ScruffyChat	So it got kind of trippy
2016-03-24 18:35:19	En_Passant	what's this for?
2016-03-24 18:36:10	ScruffyChat	The Pikmin fangame engine
2016-03-24 18:36:19	ScruffyChat	Trying to resolve a graphical glitch with background images
2016-03-24 18:36:30	@Espyo	hah
2016-03-24 18:39:14	ScruffyChat	Okay, the glitch doesn't seem to occur when the background is at negative distance
2016-03-24 18:39:40	ScruffyChat	On a side note, negative distance kinda makes it look like the terrain you're on is part of a giant ring, and the background is the other side of that ring
2016-03-24 18:40:00	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-24 18:41:38	ScruffyChat	And I don't think it occurs at 0 distance, but it's hard to tell. I'm not seizure-prone though, it's fine
2016-03-24 18:42:35	ScruffyChat	But it occuring with Grass_light.png means that square textures can still fall victim to it
2016-03-24 18:42:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-24 18:43:05	@Espyo	so the only thing that changes where the triangle "is" is the window resolution, right?
2016-03-24 18:43:18	ScruffyChat	And your zoom and your X position
2016-03-24 18:43:55	ScruffyChat	And the distance of the background itself, unless it's zero or lower
2016-03-24 18:44:18	@Espyo	right
2016-03-24 18:45:39	@Espyo	hey, I might've found the problem
2016-03-24 18:45:47	ScruffyChat	Oh?
2016-03-24 18:45:57	@Espyo	I have no idea of knowing, since I can't see the problem here
2016-03-24 18:45:58	@Espyo	but
2016-03-24 18:46:23	@Espyo	when drawing raw textures, which is what I needed to do to get that effect, you need to specify the screen coordinates, the vexel coordinates (u and v), etc.
2016-03-24 18:46:34	@Espyo	there's also data for the Z position of the screen coordinates, even though that's not used by Allegro
2016-03-24 18:46:35	@Espyo	BUT
2016-03-24 18:46:44	@Espyo	the docs are adamant about you setting that to 0, lest horrible things happen
2016-03-24 18:46:49	@Espyo	and everywhere else, I did set the Zs to 0
2016-03-24 18:46:51	@Espyo	here... I didn't
2016-03-24 18:47:01	@Espyo	could that be the solution? I should set it to 0 either way
2016-03-24 18:47:24	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-03-24 18:47:26	ScruffyChat	Could be
2016-03-24 18:47:48	@Espyo	RIP theory
2016-03-24 18:47:50	@Espyo	I am setting it to 0
2016-03-24 18:47:56	@Espyo	elsewhere
2016-03-24 18:48:39	@Espyo	besides the weird triangle, you see the background perfectly fine, right?
2016-03-24 18:48:50	@Espyo	just a texture in the distance that moves with the camera, but "farther away"
2016-03-24 18:48:56	@Espyo	it doesn't cut off randomly or anything, right?
2016-03-24 18:49:14	ScruffyChat	Yep, perfectly fine otherwise
2016-03-24 18:50:02	ScruffyChat	Maybe I should make a gif of it, or record it somehow; it's really easier to see it that way
2016-03-24 18:50:16	ScruffyChat	But changing the Z value sounds promising
2016-03-24 18:50:25	@Espyo	no, it's already set to 0, I'm afraid
2016-03-24 18:50:29	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-03-24 18:50:46	@Espyo	you could record it, but I can't really find anything else that could be going wrong
2016-03-24 18:50:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-24 18:50:53	@Espyo	it's probably another Wine weirdness

2016-03-24 18:51:27	Marty2000	Hi
2016-03-24 18:51:38	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-24 18:51:48	ScruffyChat	Well that's okay, it doesn't remove any functionality of the game, and it really isn't too distracting
2016-03-24 18:51:59	@Espyo	I guess
2016-03-24 18:52:07	@Espyo	I'll still look around to see if I can find any iffy code
2016-03-24 18:52:16	ScruffyChat	Alright, thank you
2016-03-24 18:52:47	ScruffyChat	I'm almost finished with my newest area, maybe I can compress it and share it once it's donw
2016-03-24 18:52:49	ScruffyChat	done*
2016-03-24 18:53:09	@Espyo	uuuuuh...
2016-03-24 18:53:17	@Espyo	why does it look like I'm drawing 5 vertices
2016-03-24 18:53:19	@Espyo	out of 4
2016-03-24 18:53:30	@Espyo	this is always so tricky
2016-03-24 18:53:42	@Espyo	but
2016-03-24 18:53:46	@Espyo	it would explain everything
2016-03-24 18:53:58	@Espyo	I'm essentially drawing a square, 4 vertexes
2016-03-24 18:54:04	@Espyo	if I'm actually drawing 5
2016-03-24 18:54:08	@Espyo	the fifth must have garbage data
2016-03-24 18:54:12	@Espyo	and is drawing a triangle
2016-03-24 18:54:18	@Espyo	which makes sense, given the drawing method it's using
2016-03-24 18:54:25	@Espyo	somehow, it doesn't show here
2016-03-24 18:54:28	@Espyo	could be different garbage values
2016-03-24 18:54:33	@Espyo	but I'm not celebrating yet
2016-03-24 18:54:53	@Espyo	see, it's always tricky because the function to draw a primitive wants an array of vertexes, then the starting number of the array
2016-03-24 18:55:05	@Espyo	and then the... ending number plus 1, except it's not the number of elements but it kinda is?
2016-03-24 18:55:12	@Espyo	https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/al_draw_prim
2016-03-24 18:55:17	@Espyo	>end - One past the last index of subset of the vertex buffer to draw
2016-03-24 18:55:23	@Espyo	would it have killed them to make it simpler?
2016-03-24 18:55:49	@Espyo	yyyyyyyyeah, that's the problem
2016-03-24 18:55:53	@Espyo	everywhere else that's a 4
2016-03-24 18:55:55	@Espyo	it's a 5 here
2016-03-24 18:56:00	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-03-24 18:56:00	@Espyo	that's definitely it
2016-03-24 18:56:04	@Espyo	let me change it back to see if nothing blows up
2016-03-24 18:56:40	@Espyo	hehe, fixed!
2016-03-24 18:56:50	@Espyo	I knew my only hope was to carefully look at the code
2016-03-24 18:56:52	@Espyo	and it paid off
2016-03-24 19:03:03	@Espyo	and committed
2016-03-24 19:03:07	@Espyo	thanks for the help Scruffy
2016-03-24 19:03:15	ScruffyChat	No problem!
2016-03-24 19:03:18	@Espyo	sorry you had to spend so much time hunting that down with me, ugh
2016-03-24 19:03:53	ScruffyChat	No big deal, it's fun to debug
2016-03-24 19:04:02	ScruffyChat	Well, it's fun to playtest anyway
2016-03-24 19:04:09	@Espyo	I guess, but it's still a bit of a time sink
2016-03-24 19:04:15	@Espyo	well, luckily, we got that down quickly

2016-03-24 19:15:03	@Espyo	so it doesn't deserve to have a fully detailed description on how Skutterchuck combat works
2016-03-24 19:24:30	En_Passant	It would be as simple as removing "when they are vulnerable"

2016-03-24 19:29:43	ScruffyChat	It might seem as though not a lot of puzzle elements are possible at the moment since Pikmin don't have hazard resistances yet, but this area is still pretty puzzling

I thought there was an invisible wall which prevented you from accessing the boss before getting Blue Pikmin. Is this statement true?

2016-03-24 22:35:03	-->	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.hv.zp) has joined #pikipedia
2016-03-24 22:35:09	ScruffyChat	Hi everybody!
2016-03-24 22:36:27	ScruffyChat	I think I'm going to clean up [[Randomization]] a bit
2016-03-24 22:36:28	Testyo	"Randomization" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Randomization
2016-03-24 22:36:54	ScruffyChat	If Purple Pikmin have a 30% chance of stunning an enemy, that's not random
2016-03-24 22:37:24	ScruffyChat	Something can only be completely random if each state has an equal chance of occurring
2016-03-24 22:37:27	@Espyo	|:
2016-03-24 22:37:39	@Espyo	isn't that a bit too semantic?
2016-03-24 22:37:52	@Espyo	look, I'll agree I'm not the best statistician in this room
2016-03-24 22:38:01	@Espyo	heck, statistics was one of my worst subjects in college
2016-03-24 22:38:23	@Espyo	but I'm not quite sure if "X in Y change" doesn't belong in the realm of randomness
2016-03-24 22:38:36	ScruffyChat	I suppose
2016-03-24 22:38:49	ScruffyChat	It would be the best to call the article "Chance"
2016-03-24 22:38:57	ScruffyChat	Because all of it fits in the realm of chance
2016-03-24 22:39:17	@Espyo	hm, I suppose
2016-03-24 22:39:43	@Espyo	see, technically, the game draws purely random numbers
2016-03-24 22:39:52	@Espyo	it's just that 30% of those numbers get a different outcome
2016-03-24 22:39:54	@Espyo	eeehh...
2016-03-24 22:39:58	@Espyo	still feel like this is overthinking it
2016-03-24 22:40:03	@Espyo	no, you know what the article needs?
2016-03-24 22:40:06	@Espyo	a PROPER good look
2016-03-24 22:40:12	@Espyo	when I wrote that, I assumed a couple of things
2016-03-24 22:40:16	@Espyo	ugh, present me would never allow that
2016-03-24 22:40:32	@Espyo	but bottom line is that that article needs to be cleaned up and corrected
2016-03-24 22:40:38	Marty2000	Espyo : I'll check the History to see when it was added. But I thought it was a fake too.
2016-03-24 22:40:44	ScruffyChat	I can do it
2016-03-24 22:40:46	@Espyo	and yeah, thinking about what to name it could belong to that cleanup to
2016-03-24 22:40:47	@Espyo	*too
2016-03-24 22:40:50	@Espyo	please do
2016-03-24 22:40:58	@Espyo	the biggest problem is confirming some claims
2016-03-24 22:41:13	@Espyo	mostly about how the RNG depends on the frame number
2016-03-24 22:41:18	ScruffyChat	I do know that Groink shots are not randomly deviated
2016-03-24 22:41:25	@Espyo	they're not?
2016-03-24 22:41:28	ScruffyChat	It depends entirely on the distance of the target
2016-03-24 22:41:54	ScruffyChat	If they were randomly deviated, close Groink shots could spread out as far as really far lobs
2016-03-24 22:42:57	@Espyo	maybe it's not the shot strength and angle that're deviated as much as the final calculated landing point for the three shots
2016-03-24 22:43:10	ScruffyChat	True
2016-03-24 22:43:14	@Espyo	which is on the planned target, but +- X units vertically, and +- X units horizontally
2016-03-24 22:43:32	ScruffyChat	Ah, now I see what you're saying
2016-03-24 22:43:43	ScruffyChat	Same thing happens when the Titan Dweevil uses the Monster Pump
2016-03-24 22:43:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-24 22:43:59	@Espyo	I 100% doubt the Monster Pump uses proper shooting physics
2016-03-24 22:44:07	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-03-24 22:44:07	@Espyo	it just spawns bubbles in the sky close to the target
2016-03-24 22:44:19	@Espyo	hm, that'd be a fun exercise with Dolphin's free camera
2016-03-24 22:44:39	ScruffyChat	Well actually, the water bubbles do arch from the pump to their target
2016-03-24 22:44:40	@Espyo	do the shots leave the pump, disappear, and reappear near the final target, or do they actually follow full physics?
2016-03-24 22:44:44	@Espyo	the whole way?
2016-03-24 22:44:45	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-24 22:44:52	ScruffyChat	Not really physics though
2016-03-24 22:45:25	ScruffyChat	There's point A (the pump), point B (the target), and an apex the bubble has to reach in its arch
2016-03-24 22:45:36	@Espyo	and the path is interpolated...
2016-03-24 22:45:38	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-03-24 22:45:39	ScruffyChat	Yep
2016-03-24 22:46:02	ScruffyChat	The electrical nodes however, actually do follow a rigid body physics simulation
2016-03-24 22:46:18	ScruffyChat	So, the /angle/ at which they are shot is random, but their location per se is not
2016-03-24 22:47:24	@Espyo	right
2016-03-24 22:53:52	Marty2000	Well, the dit was made here : http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Garden_of_Hope&diff=129696&oldid=129695
2016-03-24 22:54:22	@Espyo	yikes
2016-03-24 22:54:27	@Espyo	yeah, seems like a mistake

2016-03-24 22:55:34	@Espyo	right
2016-03-24 22:55:44	@Espyo	MAYBE it was possible in an earlier version?
2016-03-24 22:55:54	@Espyo	but until we figure that out, it's best to delete it, since it's a lie for the present and future
2016-03-24 22:55:56	Marty2000	Great video by the way, it's interesting to see the geometry of the level
2016-03-24 22:56:05	Marty2000	Is it possible to delete updates?
2016-03-24 22:56:23	Marty2000	I could try it this weekend if it's possible
2016-03-24 22:56:36	Marty2000	To confirm it's not possible (i think there would be videos otherwise)
2016-03-24 22:58:16	ScruffyChat	"When a carrying destination tie takes place, the final destination is randomly picked"
2016-03-24 22:58:32	ScruffyChat	What does this mean?
2016-03-24 22:58:54	ScruffyChat	if two objects reach the onion at the same time, is the first one to be absorbed randomly picked?
2016-03-24 22:59:09	ScruffyChat	Or wait
2016-03-24 22:59:22	ScruffyChat	Are they talking about equal types of each Pikmin carrying something?
2016-03-24 22:59:24	@Espyo	I think it's possible to delete updates, but REALLY cumbersome
2016-03-24 22:59:34	@Espyo	the latter
2016-03-24 22:59:37	ScruffyChat	Ah ok
2016-03-24 22:59:42	@Espyo	see, that's ANOTHER thing that needs looking into
2016-03-24 22:59:53	@Espyo	while developing the carrying mechanic on the engine, I realized that different games do this differently
2016-03-24 22:59:57	@Espyo	it deserves a good stufy
2016-03-24 22:59:59	@Espyo	*study
2016-03-24 23:00:58	ScruffyChat	That's why I'm saying this is all up to chance
2016-03-24 23:01:18	ScruffyChat	I feel like that parameter would be something predictable

2016-03-24 23:12:15	ScruffyChat	If we did it the latter way, there'd be some repeats, but it would be more in-depth
2016-03-24 23:13:07	@Espyo	wait, what're you talking about?
2016-03-24 23:13:57	ScruffyChat	Should we have a "general" section about enemy randomization (since there are some generalities) or should we detail each game's randomized enemies, or both?
2016-03-24 23:14:13	@Espyo	how many shared randomizations are there?
2016-03-24 23:14:45	ScruffyChat	For example, in both p1 and p2 dwarf bulborbs have a randomized time between Pikmin being in their radius and them noticing
2016-03-24 23:15:49	ScruffyChat	And in all 3 games roaming enemies have a list of possible distances to travel, times to wait, and angles to turn
2016-03-24 23:16:16	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-24 23:16:23	@Espyo	yeah, might as well have a list of both, then
2016-03-24 23:16:24	@Espyo	shared and unique

2016-03-25 15:06:34	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-25 15:06:37	@Espyo	okay, I'll add a todo
2016-03-25 15:06:44	@Espyo	I COULD test Pikmin 2... but Dolphin decided to die on me
2016-03-25 15:06:56	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 always had this glitch where it just stays there on the Nintendo logo
2016-03-25 15:07:06	@Espyo	and your best bet is to keep restarting the game until it works
2016-03-25 15:07:09	@Espyo	but I'm not having that luck
2016-03-25 15:07:22	Yoshi2	isn't that fixed on the newest version?
2016-03-25 15:07:32	@Espyo	wait, good point
2016-03-25 15:07:33	Marty2000	Ah yes, I tried running P2 with Dolphin once, and it also stays on the Nintendo logo
2016-03-25 15:07:35	@Espyo	what's the most recent version?

2016-03-25 15:07:50	Marty2000	I could never run it, so I deleted it
2016-03-25 15:07:59	Yoshi2	4.0.2 is pretty old
2016-03-25 15:08:02	@Espyo	it is possible, you just have to be stubborn
2016-03-25 15:08:07	@Espyo	ah crap, figured
2016-03-25 15:08:09	Yoshi2	go for one of the dev builds
2016-03-25 15:08:17	@Espyo	well, time to bite the bullet and compile a dev version
2016-03-25 15:08:17	Yoshi2	which have really high revision numbers
2016-03-25 15:08:26	@Espyo	let me just pre-emptively cry
2016-03-25 15:09:53	Yoshi2	compiling it on linux was less painful than expected except it took an hour or so
2016-03-25 15:09:55	@Espyo	hey, it's not THAT much behind
2016-03-25 15:10:15	@Espyo	current dev version is at 4.0-9146
2016-03-25 15:10:23	@Espyo	not quite sure how that translates into release-ready version numbers
2016-03-25 15:10:29	@Espyo	but can't be any more than 4.0.9
2016-03-25 15:10:36	@Espyo	uh
2016-03-25 15:10:41	@Espyo	 4.0.2 was released two years ago
2016-03-25 15:10:45	@Espyo	I'll just shut up and proceed to compile
2016-03-25 15:10:55	@Espyo	wait, I might not need to compile
2016-03-25 15:11:02	@Espyo	there's an Ubuntu 15 download available
2016-03-25 15:11:07	@Espyo	surely it'll run on Lubuntu 16

2016-03-25 15:11:24	Yoshi2	in terms of version-ready, 4.0-9146 is like 4.999999 or 5.0
2016-03-25 15:11:36	@Espyo	I remember adding that PPA
2016-03-25 15:11:41	@Espyo	hmm

2016-03-25 15:17:54	@Espyo	okay, everything is definitely up to date now, but still no luck
2016-03-25 15:17:58	@Espyo	time to search around

2016-03-25 15:23:41	@Espyo	and yeah, it could be useful
2016-03-25 15:27:49	Marty2000	Ah, I couldn't watch it.  The last technique required to waste many ultra-bitter spray but this one technique will be better for sure. I hope to see some new records in the next few days

2016-03-25 16:00:45	@Espyo	if only opening the ports didn't require me to put my cat on the ground, carry the laptop through the house, plug it in, fumble with the router's IP, credentials, and maze-like interface, unlock, grab the laptop back, replug everything, put cat back on lap, wrestle with cat as she probably doesn't want lap any more, only to realize I set it up wrong because Testyo still isn't working and I have to do it all over again...

2016-03-25 16:27:50	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-25 16:27:52	@Espyo	they are the same
2016-03-25 16:27:56	@Espyo	it's just their names that are different
2016-03-25 16:27:59	@Espyo	ugh, it's a bit of a mess
2016-03-25 16:28:10	@Espyo	because the "names" of the Japanese treasures we have are conjecture
2016-03-25 16:28:15	@Espyo	and the names of those files are the internal treasure names
2016-03-25 16:28:27	Marty2000	Ah, ok, the names don't fit.
2016-03-25 16:29:35	@Espyo	baaah
2016-03-25 16:29:40	@Espyo	where could Dolphin possibly be saving my data?
2016-03-25 16:29:48	@Espyo	there's ~/.config/dolphin-emu
2016-03-25 16:29:51	@Espyo	that has the program settings
2016-03-25 16:30:00	@Espyo	but what about the save states, memory cards, etc.?
2016-03-25 16:30:06	@Espyo	J: what are some popular directories for saving stuff?
2016-03-25 16:30:22	@Espyo	there's nothing under ~/.dolphin-emu, which is where data for older versions of Dolphin used to be saved at
2016-03-25 16:31:13	Marty2000	Isn't the save data in the main Dolphin folder/User?
2016-03-25 16:31:27	@Espyo	should be, but I don't know where that main folder is now

Maybe there's a similar option for Gamecube gmes
2016-03-25 16:34:29	@Espyo	not quite, but I found out where it is
2016-03-25 16:34:37	@Espyo	I took a screenshot, and it tells you where it saved it to

2016-03-25 16:38:04	@Espyo	it's not outlandish
2016-03-25 16:38:11	Neocraftz1553	hey Espyo...
2016-03-25 16:38:15	@Espyo	and a spirit on an abyss isn't any different than a normal spirit
2016-03-25 16:38:16	Neocraftz1553	^^^
2016-03-25 16:38:20	@Espyo	yeah yeah, I bet it's trouble
2016-03-25 16:38:28	Neocraftz1553	heh 
2016-03-25 16:38:30	@Espyo	oh, this is on fanon
2016-03-25 16:38:39	@Espyo	because I had trouble with this user before, but that was on Pikipedia
2016-03-25 16:38:54	@Espyo	oh, it's the enemy shake death glitch
2016-03-25 16:38:55	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-25 16:39:00	Neocraftz1553	nah
2016-03-25 16:39:06	Neocraftz1553	kts about the glitch
2016-03-25 16:39:15	Neocraftz1553	should I...

2016-03-25 16:39:47	@Espyo	speaking of glitches
2016-03-25 16:39:51	@Espyo	did you get any other glitch to happen?
2016-03-25 16:39:53	Neocraftz1553	pikmin attacking the shaking hitbox
2016-03-25 16:39:58	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah
2016-03-25 16:40:05	@Espyo	I'll launch the update tomorrow if I can't get any more fixes done
2016-03-25 16:40:11	@Espyo	maybe I'll do it today
2016-03-25 16:40:16	Neocraftz1553	I found how to reproduce a glitch
2016-03-25 16:41:21	Neocraftz1553	have a captain throw a pikmin at a treasure or pellet(anything "dead") located on a ledge higher than the captain or pikmin
2016-03-25 16:41:33	Neocraftz1553	something like 700 1000
2016-03-25 16:41:45	Neocraftz1553	directly on the object
2016-03-25 16:42:25	Neocraftz1553	then, if theres nothing behing the object, no wall, bottemless pit, etc.
2016-03-25 16:42:42	Neocraftz1553	the pikmin should get stuck in its thrown animation behing the wall
2016-03-25 16:42:56	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-03-25 16:42:56	Neocraftz1553	I used a 2 Euro
2016-03-25 16:42:56	Testyo	2 Euro = £ 1.4132  / $ 2.1744

2016-03-25 16:44:17	@Espyo	so, if I go on Play, get some Yellows, toss them to the center of the 10-pellet near the spawn point
2016-03-25 16:44:20	@Espyo	that glitch will happen?
2016-03-25 16:44:32	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-25 16:44:39	Neocraftz1553	is there nothng behind the pellet
2016-03-25 16:44:47	@Espyo	the pellet is surrounding by nothingness, yeah
2016-03-25 16:44:52	Neocraftz1553	oh, not on play
2016-03-25 16:44:55	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/12/1458924276-spirit-for-abyss.png
2016-03-25 16:44:59	Neocraftz1553	err...
2016-03-25 16:45:09	@Espyo	yep, those are spirits all right
2016-03-25 16:45:11	Neocraftz1553	as long as there are no sectors behind the pellet
2016-03-25 16:45:15	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-25 16:45:26	@Espyo	though I guess you can upload that image, since it sorta shows where the spirits appear on
2016-03-25 16:45:42	@Espyo	well, the pellet is on its own sector
2016-03-25 16:45:53	Marty2000	So I should upload it on Pikipedia?
2016-03-25 16:46:12	Marty2000	Well, okay
2016-03-25 16:46:13	@Espyo	yeah, might as well
2016-03-25 16:46:37	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it should be on its own sector
2016-03-25 16:46:38	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: but either way, this glitch is where the Pikmin get stuck on their thrown animation, and keep sliding forward on the ground until they hit a wall, right?
2016-03-25 16:46:41	Neocraftz1553	but that sector should't be surrounded by other sectors
2016-03-25 16:46:53	Neocraftz1553	no...
2016-03-25 16:47:12	@Espyo	a different bug then?
2016-03-25 16:47:13	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-25 16:47:16	Neocraftz1553	err... actuall, kinda
2016-03-25 16:47:32	Neocraftz1553	mine don't stop spinning, though
2016-03-25 16:47:39	@Espyo	they never did
2016-03-25 16:47:42	Neocraftz1553	thats when they hit a wall
2016-03-25 16:47:56	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok, then you may have found it
2016-03-25 16:48:16	@Espyo	well yeah, it's the classic "stuck on thrown state" glitch
2016-03-25 16:48:17	@Espyo	I fixed it
2016-03-25 16:48:25	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-25 16:48:36	Neocraftz1553	good, cause its fairly annoying...
2016-03-25 16:48:39	Neocraftz1553	and kinda major
2016-03-25 16:48:45	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-25 16:48:52	Neocraftz1553	since pikmin cannot be retrieved
2016-03-25 16:49:07	Neocraftz1553	unless you lure sheargrubs under them
2016-03-25 16:49:22	Neocraftz1553	then they'll act like they squashed them and fall down

2016-03-25 17:05:30	Neocraftz1553	Oh, and Espyo, there does seem to be a problem with hitboxes overlapping each other 
2016-03-25 17:07:06	@Espyo	hm?
2016-03-25 17:07:30	Neocraftz1553	in the sunset bulborb, an eye hitbox overlaps the mouth hitbox in the attack animation
2016-03-25 17:07:54	Neocraftz1553	so pikmin attacking the eyes get eaten
2016-03-25 17:10:03	@Espyo	I told you the solution at the time

2016-03-25 19:56:30	ScruffyChat	I can't stay for long, but just wanted to make them known
2016-03-25 19:57:07	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-25 19:57:08	@Espyo	oh?
2016-03-25 19:57:24	@Espyo	Yoshi2: probably the latter
2016-03-25 19:57:49	Yoshi2	I guess there is a reason it is marked as "testing"

2016-03-25 19:58:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-25 20:00:42	ScruffyChat	Okay I only have a few minutes, let's do this
2016-03-25 20:01:05	ScruffyChat	When you throw pikmin and then whistle them or get close enough before they hit the ground, they come back
2016-03-25 20:01:25	@Espyo	you mean they come back before they land?
2016-03-25 20:01:28	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-03-25 20:01:31	@Espyo	what
2016-03-25 20:01:33	ScruffyChat	They turn around in midair
2016-03-25 20:02:11	@Espyo	can't get that to happen
2016-03-25 20:02:16	ScruffyChat	Wait sorry, not with whistling
2016-03-25 20:02:23	@Espyo	although I DID fix a turn-in-midair glitch recently
2016-03-25 20:02:32	ScruffyChat	Just with walking close enough to them while they are thrown
2016-03-25 20:03:00	@Espyo	but... that can't be right...
2016-03-25 20:03:19	@Espyo	how can you be so sure they're in the air? how early does it happen in the jump?
2016-03-25 20:03:34	ScruffyChat	Hmm, it doesn't seem to be happening anymore
2016-03-25 20:03:44	ScruffyChat	I might have though that was the case
2016-03-25 20:04:08	@Espyo	well, as per a glitch Neo found, if you use the C-stick (spacebar) to tell them to walk off an edge, they turn around in mid-air
2016-03-25 20:04:13	@Espyo	and become broken for quite a while afterwards
2016-03-25 20:04:20	ScruffyChat	hm
2016-03-25 20:04:40	ScruffyChat	Never mind about the turning around in midair
2016-03-25 20:04:55	ScruffyChat	It might have looked that way to me because I was throwing them over a pellet
2016-03-25 20:05:06	ScruffyChat	But it doesn't seem to happen now that I test it out more and more
2016-03-25 20:05:07	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-25 20:05:19	@Espyo	well, I guess we can skip over this one
2016-03-25 20:05:27	@Espyo	even if it happens, if it's rare, it's not worth that much trouble
2016-03-25 20:05:30	@Espyo	I'll fix it in some other version
2016-03-25 20:05:38	ScruffyChat	But another is more important, not a glitch though
2016-03-25 20:05:43	@Espyo	right
2016-03-25 20:06:06	ScruffyChat	When Pikmin are added to an item to carry it, the Pikmin already carrying it stop
2016-03-25 20:06:11	ScruffyChat	Like in P1 and P2
2016-03-25 20:06:24	ScruffyChat	But they don't start again until that Pikmin has attached
2016-03-25 20:06:52	@Espyo	right, that's all intended
2016-03-25 20:06:56	ScruffyChat	So if the Pikmin is on a lower ledge or in a corner and can't pick it up, the other Pikmin will never move even if more than enough are carryingit
2016-03-25 20:07:09	@Espyo	hm, yeah...
2016-03-25 20:07:17	@Espyo	well, do you have any suggestions?
2016-03-25 20:07:32	@Espyo	I chose to let them stop otherwise once it got moving, Pikmin would never catch up
2016-03-25 20:07:38	@Espyo	going around obstacles is so horrible in the engine
2016-03-25 20:07:39	ScruffyChat	True
2016-03-25 20:07:44	@Espyo	maybe once I clean it up... IF I can
2016-03-25 20:07:57	ScruffyChat	Well...
2016-03-25 20:08:00	@Espyo	I tried so many ways to get objects to go around other objects better
2016-03-25 20:08:07	@Espyo	but the current way is the only way I've got
2016-03-25 20:08:12	@Espyo	to just sloooooowly slide across
2016-03-25 20:08:17	ScruffyChat	Maybe have a time limit Pikmin wait to receive other Pikmin
2016-03-25 20:08:30	ScruffyChat	Like 2 seconds
2016-03-25 20:08:33	@Espyo	I've got the opposite — a time limit for Pikmin wanting to reach an object
2016-03-25 20:08:53	@Espyo	...come to think of it, that might never show because once the timer runs out, they turn idle, instantly spot the object again, and repeats
2016-03-25 20:08:54	@Espyo	welp
2016-03-25 20:09:06	@Espyo	yeah, that's exactly what happens
2016-03-25 20:09:08	@Espyo	well then
2016-03-25 20:09:13	ScruffyChat	Cool
2016-03-25 20:09:15	@Espyo	I need a "I give up" state
2016-03-25 20:09:22	ScruffyChat	Man...
2016-03-25 20:09:24	@Espyo	to give enough time for a Pikmin to not retry something straight away
2016-03-25 20:09:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-25 20:09:39	ScruffyChat	P3 has that
2016-03-25 20:09:46	ScruffyChat	and P1 has that I think
2016-03-25 20:09:49	@Espyo	the GC ones have too, I think
2016-03-25 20:09:53	@Espyo	doesn't P2?
2016-03-25 20:10:17	ScruffyChat	In P2 they don't have a give up animation, they either return to you or, if you're too far away, just become idle for a time
2016-03-25 20:11:03	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-25 20:11:17	ScruffyChat	You could have it so that Pikmin carrying only stop the moment new Pikmin latch on, and not when Pikmin are trying to latch on
2016-03-25 20:11:33	@Espyo	the latching on is instantaneous
2016-03-25 20:11:37	@Espyo	so it can't be like that
2016-03-25 20:11:37	ScruffyChat	Then instate a time for Pikmin to be idly giving up
2016-03-25 20:11:39	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-03-25 20:11:50	@Espyo	it'll have to be a combination of things, I'm seeing
2016-03-25 20:11:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-25 20:12:00	@Espyo	both cleaning up the going-around-stuff code, and adding an "I give up" state
2016-03-25 20:12:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-25 20:12:13	ScruffyChat	And one more thing before I go
2016-03-25 20:12:22	@Espyo	I mean, the Pikmin in Pikmin 3 don't stop for anything, so if P3 does it, I have to do it too
2016-03-25 20:12:31	ScruffyChat	Female Sheargrubs can push Pikmin through walls
2016-03-25 20:12:39	@Espyo	...
2016-03-25 20:12:41	@Espyo	I feared that
2016-03-25 20:12:47	ScruffyChat	even blocking walls
2016-03-25 20:12:50	@Espyo	how easy is it for that to happen?
2016-03-25 20:13:01	ScruffyChat	Very easy
2016-03-25 20:13:03	@Espyo	oh, I guess so long as the Pikmin isn't moving
2016-03-25 20:13:12	@Espyo	the game only checks for collisions for moving objects
2016-03-25 20:13:25	@Espyo	hm, I might be able to change that
2016-03-25 20:13:28	@Espyo	all right, thanks for the input
2016-03-25 20:13:31	ScruffyChat	And it's also easy for the sheargrub to move away from a Pikmin while it's attacking, and the Pikmin attacks at nothing
2016-03-25 20:13:43	@Espyo	yeah, I see that happening too
2016-03-25 20:13:51	@Espyo	I'll have to balance distances one day
2016-03-25 20:14:00	ScruffyChat	So I guess maybe the Pikmin should attack and then check for an enemy and follow it if it's not there
2016-03-25 20:14:15	@Espyo	they do, it's just that their "I can attack" radius is too big
2016-03-25 20:14:22	ScruffyChat	Since a Pikmin attacking and a Pikmin latching on to attack are two different states
2016-03-25 20:14:29	ScruffyChat	Ah I see
2016-03-25 20:14:38	@Espyo	if the enemy is near the end of this radius, by the time the animation is done, the enemy is already far beyond any recognizable radius
2016-03-25 20:15:01	ScruffyChat	AH
2016-03-25 20:15:02	ScruffyChat	Ah*
2016-03-25 20:15:26	ScruffyChat	That's all I have so far
2016-03-25 20:15:29	@Espyo	all right
2016-03-25 20:15:31	@Espyo	thanks again
2016-03-25 20:15:34	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-03-25 20:15:42	ScruffyChat	Collisions with walls are flawless otherwise
2016-03-25 20:15:52	ScruffyChat	They work very well
2016-03-25 20:15:57	@Espyo	not really flawless
2016-03-25 20:16:02	@Espyo	I know of some scenarios where they're flawed :P
2016-03-25 20:16:06	@Espyo	but those scenarios aren't realistic to happen
2016-03-25 20:16:10	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-03-25 20:16:15	@Espyo	you have to make walls specifically laid out in a certain way to get weird results
2016-03-25 20:16:20	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-25 20:16:22	@Espyo	and even then it's not BAD results
2016-03-25 20:16:29	@Espyo	at most, objects don't slide on those walls
2016-03-25 20:16:34	@Espyo	so I'm pretty pleased
2016-03-25 20:16:39	ScruffyChat	Maybe someday someone will make an area that's intentionally that way to be difficult
2016-03-25 20:16:42	@Espyo	with how the worst case scenario is both rare and barely important
2016-03-25 20:16:50	ScruffyChat	And a negative distance background
2016-03-25 20:17:06	@Espyo	it's almost guaranteed somebody will
2016-03-25 20:17:12	@Espyo	Kaizo Pikmin
2016-03-25 20:17:20	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-03-25 20:17:28	ScruffyChat	Well, I gotta go
2016-03-25 20:17:53	ScruffyChat	see ya, glad I could mention those
2016-03-25 20:17:59	@Espyo	see ya

2016-03-25 20:19:01	Marty2000	Does someone know where to find this ribbon? i've looked for it everywhere in the map and I just can't find it :/
2016-03-25 20:19:21	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Purple_Ribbon.png
2016-03-25 20:19:42	@Espyo	wow, that image is so big
2016-03-25 20:19:57	@Espyo	well, maybe the size is a hint
2016-03-25 20:20:01	@Espyo	it's really hard to see except in the distance
2016-03-25 20:20:20	@Espyo	I don't really know the map by heart, so I can't really tell right away where it is
2016-03-25 20:20:56	@Espyo	from the texture of the place that it is on and from the map...
2016-03-25 20:20:57	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/6/62/Fortress_of_Festivity_map.png
2016-03-25 20:21:01	@Espyo	it looks like it's on that red present at the north
2016-03-25 20:21:10	Marty2000	Anyway, that's so hard to find... I'm just trying to get a better screenshot of this one
2016-03-25 20:21:26	Marty2000	I'll look for it a third time but I think I've already visited that place
2016-03-25 20:21:30	Marty2000	But thanks
2016-03-25 20:21:36	@Espyo	other than that... I can't really see it
2016-03-25 20:21:37	@Espyo	good luck
2016-03-25 20:21:59	Marty2000	Thanks. The other ones are far easier to find...
2016-03-25 20:22:13	@Espyo	I bet
2016-03-25 20:26:59	Marty2000	Ah, by the way, there's something interesting : Pikmin seem to have differnt times for their evolution in Mission mode. For example, in Fortress of Fesitivty, both reds and Rocks evolve into buds when time reaches 9:00, but only Rocks evolve into flowers when time reaches 7:05
2016-03-25 20:27:14	Marty2000	Fortress of Festivity*
2016-03-25 20:28:01	Marty2000	Those Reds evolve when time reaches 6:35
2016-03-25 20:28:33	Marty2000	And Purples haven't even started evolving into buds
2016-03-25 20:28:49	Marty2000	They only do when the time reaches 6:00
2016-03-25 20:29:17	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-25 20:29:25	@Espyo	and they all start as leafs?
2016-03-25 20:29:29	Marty2000	Yep
2016-03-25 20:29:47	Marty2000	I could take photos to show the difference
2016-03-25 20:29:49	@Espyo	hmm, they might have some data for how far they are in the current stage, when they spawn
2016-03-25 20:29:52	@Espyo	no need
2016-03-25 20:30:00	@Espyo	I'll check the game's files for any info like that
2016-03-25 20:30:05	Marty2000	I'm just wondering why they evolve at different times
2016-03-25 20:30:14	@Espyo	probably a matter of balance
2016-03-25 20:30:17	Marty2000	Ah, you can? Well, that's great
2016-03-25 20:30:25	Marty2000	Maybe
2016-03-25 20:30:38	@Espyo	maybe they delayed the Purple growth so much to discourage getting them late
2016-03-25 20:30:51	@Espyo	maybe it's more efficient getting them soon, and this is a way to encourage the player to do so
2016-03-25 20:30:52	Marty2000	I'll check in another map to verify
2016-03-25 20:30:56	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-25 20:31:06	Marty2000	I'll try in Thirsty Desert since there are many purples
2016-03-25 20:31:16	Marty2000	Remix*
2016-03-25 20:31:58	@Espyo	bleh, I don't have data for DLC maps
2016-03-25 20:32:37	Marty2000	Just a memo for myself : Purples were in leaf at 8:00, Whites were planted at 7:20
2016-03-25 20:32:42	Marty2000	Ah?
2016-03-25 20:32:53	@Espyo	I can still check other maps to see if this data exists
2016-03-25 20:33:01	@Espyo	but it'd be better to cross-check with what you have, about Fortress of Festivity
2016-03-25 20:35:06	Marty2000	Purple Pikmin are planted in "groups" in Thirsty Desert Remix, and it seems each group has a different time before evolving
2016-03-25 20:35:35	Marty2000	The group closest to the SPERO evolved into buds at 5:55
2016-03-25 20:36:00	Marty2000	Another group started evolving at about 5:45 
2016-03-25 20:36:26	Marty2000	3 other groups of Purples are still in leaf...
2016-03-25 20:36:53	Marty2000	Whites started evolving at 5:15
2016-03-25 20:37:13	Marty2000	The rest of Purples still haven't begun evolving.
2016-03-25 20:37:41	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-03-25 20:37:48	@Espyo	I'm still trying to open the files
2016-03-25 20:37:51	@Espyo	need to setup tools
2016-03-25 20:37:53	Marty2000	(By the way, that's so rare to see bud Pikmin in pikmin 3...)
2016-03-25 20:37:55	Marty2000	Okay
2016-03-25 20:39:35	@Espyo	(yeah)
2016-03-25 20:40:24	Marty2000	Oh... the group of Purples which evolved into buds at 5:45 evolved into flowers BEFORE the group which evolved into buds at 5:55
2016-03-25 20:40:42	Marty2000	Some groups are still in leaf form.
2016-03-25 20:41:10	Marty2000	I'll retry the levl afterwards...
2016-03-25 20:41:14	Marty2000	To see if this is random
2016-03-25 20:42:10	Marty2000	Whites started evolving into flower at 2:50
2016-03-25 20:42:24	Marty2000	Well... only one of the group of 5
2016-03-25 20:42:55	Marty2000	Another White evolved into flower at 2:30
2016-03-25 20:43:25	Marty2000	Every white has evolved from 2:20
2016-03-25 20:44:03	Marty2000	From now : there a group of flower Purples, a group of flower Whites, 3 groups of leaf Purples, one group of bud Purples
2016-03-25 20:44:26	Marty2000	And the group of bud Purples was the first to evolve
2016-03-25 20:44:34	Marty2000	But they are still in bud form...
2016-03-25 20:46:01	Marty2000	A group of leaf Purples evolved into bud at 1:15
2016-03-25 20:47:28	Marty2000	At 0:25, the first group of bud Purples evolved into flower Purples
2016-03-25 20:48:20	Marty2000	The 2 group of leaf Purples left didn't evolve at all
2016-03-25 20:48:27	Marty2000	(Sorry for my many posts)

2016-03-25 20:55:57	Marty2000	Hi
2016-03-25 20:56:22	Marty2000	It seems to be constant for Whites anyway
2016-03-25 20:56:34	Marty2000	But seems to be different for Purples
2016-03-25 20:56:53	@PikFan	hmm?

2016-03-25 20:59:07	Marty2000	But it seems random for Purples

2016-03-25 20:59:17	Marty2000	Whites evolved around 5:15 both times
2016-03-25 20:59:24	Marty2000	Purples evolved at different times

2016-03-25 21:00:04	@PikFan	that's so weird
2016-03-25 21:00:30	Marty2000	I'm only making experiments for the moment but I'll probably make a video of this behaviour
2016-03-25 21:02:23	@PikFan	mm
2016-03-25 21:02:25	Marty2000	The same group of 10 Purples is the first to evolve 
2016-03-25 21:02:38	@PikFan	I'll have to try it myself sometime
2016-03-25 21:03:03	Marty2000	in both cases
2016-03-25 21:03:23	Marty2000	I'll sum up the situation before it gets even more confusing
2016-03-25 21:03:53	Marty2000	Let's take the 2 groups of Purples which were the quickest to evolve
2016-03-25 21:04:01	Marty2000	Let's call them A and B
2016-03-25 21:04:31	Marty2000	First try : A evolved into bud before B, but B evolved into flowers before A at the end
2016-03-25 21:04:49	Marty2000	Second try : B evolved into bud before A, and evolved into flower before A too
2016-03-25 21:05:17	Marty2000	Some groups seem to never evolve
2016-03-25 21:06:55	@PikFan	wow
2016-03-25 21:07:08	Marty2000	Whites are still constant
2016-03-25 21:07:13	Marty2000	Same times in both tries
2016-03-25 21:08:16	Marty2000	A evolved into flowers earlier during my second try
2016-03-25 21:08:38	Marty2000	First try : 0:25
2016-03-25 21:08:48	Marty2000	Second try : 1:50
2016-03-25 21:11:36	Marty2000	The last group of Purples which had evolved into buds in my first try is the last to evolve in my second try as well
2016-03-25 21:11:56	Marty2000	Times are different though : 
2016-03-25 21:12:01	Marty2000	First try : 1:15
2016-03-25 21:12:06	Marty2000	Second try : 0:10
2016-03-25 21:14:02	Marty2000	Well, I'll give it a try for the third time
2016-03-25 21:17:11	Marty2000	Third try : B evolved into bud before A (same as the second try)

2016-03-25 21:20:38	Marty2000	But earlier

2016-03-25 21:20:48	Marty2000	than*
2016-03-25 21:21:26	Marty2000	However
2016-03-25 21:21:56	Marty2000	A and Whites evolved at the same time during my third try
2016-03-25 21:22:02	Marty2000	Whites were constant
2016-03-25 21:22:06	Marty2000	But A evolved earlier
2016-03-25 21:22:10	Marty2000	A lot earlier
2016-03-25 21:23:37	Marty2000	To sum up the situation with every try :
2016-03-25 21:24:37	Marty2000	First try : A evolves into bud before B/B evolves into flower before A (A evolved into flower at 1:15)

2016-03-25 21:26:02	Testyo	Also, I'm considering moving some of the upgrade treasures to the computer running, though

2016-03-25 21:47:45	@Espyo	wow this is actually giving me a pain
2016-03-25 21:48:02	@Espyo	I gather that I can edit what programs to open with what extensions by editing the .desktop files found on different "share" folders
2016-03-25 21:48:07	@Espyo	and everything works
2016-03-25 21:48:13	@Espyo	but if I dare try to run a Python script
2016-03-25 21:48:15	@Espyo	all hell breaks loose
2016-03-25 21:48:31	Marty2000	Could you see my three tries?
2016-03-25 21:49:14	@Espyo	more or less, I just read through them very quickly
2016-03-25 21:49:17	@Espyo	what was your conclusion?
2016-03-25 21:49:50	Marty2000	Well, I'll restard : let's call a group of Purples A and another group of Purples B. A group of whites is also studied
2016-03-25 21:50:06	Marty2000	First try : A evolves into bud before B/B evolves into flower before A (A evolved into flower at 1:15)
2016-03-25 21:50:18	Marty2000	Second try : B evolves into bud and flower before A (A evolved into flower at 0:10)
2016-03-25 21:50:26	Marty2000	Third try : B evolves into bud and flower before A (A evolves into flower at 2:20)
2016-03-25 21:50:32	Marty2000	Every try : Whites evolve into flower at 2:20
2016-03-25 21:50:52	@Espyo	I see
2016-03-25 21:50:54	@Espyo	so it seems random
2016-03-25 21:50:55	Marty2000	(or around 2:20, usually it's a matter of seconds)
2016-03-25 21:51:20	Marty2000	For Purples, it seems random indeed, but Whites seem constant
2016-03-25 21:51:33	Marty2000	I have only tried in Thirsty Desert Remix
2016-03-25 21:51:54	Marty2000	Maybe we'll discover new things in another area. I'll try later.
2016-03-25 21:52:28	@Espyo	I just wish I could get this to work
2016-03-25 21:53:00	Marty2000	I didn't even know it was possible to get Pikmin 3 files
2016-03-25 21:53:08	Marty2000	Was the Wii U hacked?
2016-03-25 21:53:38	@Espyo	more or less
2016-03-25 21:53:49	@Espyo	people have been handing out the game's files for a while

2016-03-25 22:20:56	En_Passant	I did that part on the next day

2016-03-25 22:46:19	Neocraftz1553	add a line of text in the Data file saying:

2016-03-25 22:46:20	Neocraftz1553	I meant to put maturity_time in the last one too

2016-03-25 23:01:16	Neocraftz1553	Espyo, what did you think of the map?
2016-03-25 23:01:22	@Espyo	looks nice
2016-03-25 23:01:31	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2016-03-25 23:01:33	@Espyo	but with the guide in the way, it's hard to see what parts are the map, what parts are the guide
2016-03-25 23:01:55	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-25 23:02:13	Neocraftz1553	I'll post it without guideonce I'm finished with the walls.
2016-03-25 23:02:22	Neocraftz1553	probably... in 5 mins

2016-03-25 23:03:01	Klemen702	wait
2016-03-25 23:03:07	Klemen702	will the map just be walking
2016-03-25 23:03:12	Klemen702	the one you will post
2016-03-25 23:03:15	Klemen702	or any gameplay too
2016-03-25 23:05:51	Neocraftz1553	you want gameplay?
2016-03-25 23:06:05	Klemen702	yes
2016-03-25 23:06:05	Neocraftz1553	I could take a screenshot, if you want
2016-03-25 23:06:08	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-25 23:06:26	Klemen702	well
2016-03-25 23:06:30	Neocraftz1553	I'll take a screenshot, upload it, then upload the actual map
2016-03-25 23:06:32	Klemen702	i was only wondering if the map has any
2016-03-25 23:06:42	Klemen702	because i only saw the wall stuff on it
2016-03-25 23:06:49	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it has playability
2016-03-25 23:06:52	Klemen702	i am more of a player than a maker
2016-03-25 23:06:54	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-25 23:07:33	Neocraftz1553	but...
2016-03-25 23:07:44	Neocraftz1553	you'll have to download some things...
2016-03-25 23:07:49	Neocraftz1553	for the map to work...
2016-03-25 23:07:55	Neocraftz1553	textures and objects...
2016-03-25 23:08:15	Klemen702	that is fine
2016-03-25 23:08:30	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-25 23:09:25	Neocraftz1553	hey Espyo, you want it too?
2016-03-25 23:09:32	Neocraftz1553	I need some testers
2016-03-25 23:11:27	@Espyo	not right now, I'm busy fixing bugs
2016-03-25 23:13:08	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-25 23:13:27	Neocraftz1553	we're going to need a lot of bug spray...
2016-03-25 23:13:35	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-25 23:15:39	Neocraftz1553	now for the paths...
2016-03-25 23:15:57	Marty2000	Ah, I found the Purple ribbon
2016-03-25 23:16:01	Marty2000	Finally...
2016-03-25 23:16:08	@Espyo	oh?
2016-03-25 23:16:10	@Espyo	where was it?
2016-03-25 23:16:34	Marty2000	Wait, i will publish a screenshot (on another site)
2016-03-25 23:16:37	Marty2000	So you can see
2016-03-25 23:16:40	@Espyo	okay
2016-03-25 23:16:48	Marty2000	Maybe it's where you told me to go... I don't recall
2016-03-25 23:18:25	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/12/1458947875-purple.png
2016-03-25 23:18:44	@Espyo	nope, that's not where I said
2016-03-25 23:18:59	@Espyo	well, glad you finally found it
2016-03-25 23:19:16	Marty2000	Thanks. I'll publish a screenshot of the ribbon itself
2016-03-25 23:19:36	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-25 23:19:43	@Espyo	you can probably replace the existing image
2016-03-25 23:19:59	@Espyo	go to the old image's page, and click a link that says something like "upload a new version of this image"
2016-03-25 23:20:06	@Espyo	the old one is horribly tiny
2016-03-25 23:20:08	@Espyo	it's almost useless
2016-03-25 23:20:28	Marty2000	Yep, that's what I already did for the Red Ribbon
2016-03-25 23:20:30	Marty2000	But thanks
2016-03-25 23:20:55	Klemen702	so
2016-03-25 23:21:02	@Espyo	all right, good
2016-03-25 23:21:05	Klemen702	now we are talking about ribbons in a pikmin 3 map...
2016-03-25 23:21:12	Klemen702	freaking ribbons
2016-03-25 23:21:25	Neocraftz1553	not just any ribbon
2016-03-25 23:21:31	Neocraftz1553	a PURPLE ribbon
2016-03-25 23:21:38	Klemen702	so?

2016-03-25 23:22:37	Marty2000	But mine won't be much better, I think...
2016-03-25 23:24:22	Marty2000	I have uploaded a new version, I think it's a bit more visible but it's still hard to see the purple color...
2016-03-25 23:24:51	Klemen702	lol
2016-03-25 23:24:54	Klemen702	i should go sleep

2016-03-25 23:43:53	@Espyo	can't quite put my finger on it
2016-03-25 23:44:01	@Espyo	I think it's mostly the proportions
2016-03-25 23:44:07	@Espyo	they don't look like they match up to how they are in P1
2016-03-25 23:44:15	@Espyo	also it looks like there's stuff missing?
2016-03-25 23:44:26	@Espyo	and I'm VERY sure that you flipped the map horizontally :|
2016-03-25 23:44:41	@Espyo	I distinctly remember the path to the Libra being on the west

2016-03-25 23:45:54	Neocraftz1553	and...
2016-03-25 23:45:54	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure...
2016-03-25 23:45:54	Neocraftz1553	it makes it look different
2016-03-25 23:45:59	Neocraftz1553	weird, as you said
2016-03-25 23:45:59	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-25 23:46:20	Neocraftz1553	and you are right in proportions...
2016-03-25 23:46:28	Neocraftz1553	at least where the rocky area is
2016-03-25 23:46:37	Neocraftz1553	and the blue onion
2016-03-25 23:46:39	@Espyo	right
2016-03-25 23:46:59	Neocraftz1553	the others are more or less the size in P1
2016-03-25 23:49:49	Neocraftz1553	its not supposed to be exactly like it was in P1
2016-03-25 23:49:49	Neocraftz1553	as you can see, the walls around the beady long legs arena is walkable
2016-03-25 23:49:49	Neocraftz1553	err.... grammer mistakes
2016-03-25 23:49:52	Neocraftz1553	but you get what I mean

2016-03-25 23:49:52	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-03-25 23:49:52	Neocraftz1553	the part where there were the two bridges
2016-03-25 23:49:52	Neocraftz1553	there used to be a round platform where one was
2016-03-25 23:49:53	Neocraftz1553	I didn't put it in...
2016-03-25 23:49:53	Neocraftz1553	or else pikmin will get stuck under it and die like in the game :P
2016-03-25 23:49:53	Testyo	Neocraftz1553 is flooding!
2016-03-25 23:49:53	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-03-25 23:49:54	Neocraftz1553	oh, and a bug
2016-03-25 23:49:57	Neocraftz1553	a minor audio bug
2016-03-25 23:50:08	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-25 23:50:16	@Espyo	hm? audio bug?

2016-03-25 23:50:43	Neocraftz1553	Both the audio when the pikmin pick up objects and carry them doesn't play at their respective times
2016-03-25 23:51:14	Neocraftz1553	they don't play at all...
2016-03-25 23:51:18	Neocraftz1553	it removes most of the ambience of the game
2016-03-25 23:51:27	Neocraftz1553	so usually when I am playing the map is silent :|
2016-03-25 23:52:37	@Espyo	the carrying sound got removed in 0.7 because of some internal changes
2016-03-25 23:52:46	@Espyo	there'll be an update in the future where I clean up all sounds
2016-03-25 23:52:49	@Espyo	and it'll feel much better
2016-03-25 23:52:51	@Espyo	maybe 0.9 or 0.10
2016-03-25 23:53:09	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-25 23:53:35	Neocraftz1553	ounds good
2016-03-25 23:53:35	Neocraftz1553	sounds good
2016-03-25 23:53:35	Neocraftz1553	see what I did there
2016-03-25 23:53:39	@Espyo	|:
2016-03-25 23:53:41	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-25 23:53:46	Neocraftz1553	also, maybe add in pellets for different pikmin...
2016-03-25 23:54:09	@Espyo	they can be made, although they don't exist
2016-03-25 23:54:18	@Espyo	I just never got around to it because remember — I only pack demo content
2016-03-25 23:54:25	@Espyo	not the entire building blocks for a fangame
2016-03-25 23:54:43	@Espyo	otherwise I'd put a lot more textures, more sounds (even if they're not used at the moment), all pellets, etc.
2016-03-25 23:54:53	Neocraftz1553	red yellow and blue
2016-03-25 23:54:55	Neocraftz1553	cause I saw scruffys screenshot with hime next to the yellow onion with a red 10...
2016-03-25 23:54:58	Neocraftz1553	and I was like, "why doesn't he use the yellow 10... oh yeah...
2016-03-25 23:55:01	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-25 23:55:05	@Espyo	but it can be easily made
2016-03-25 23:55:18	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I know
2016-03-25 23:55:29	Neocraftz1553	(green pellets, anyone?)
2016-03-25 23:55:43	Neocraftz1553	OH I GET IT
2016-03-25 23:56:18	Neocraftz1553	thats why it says Pikmin Fangame Demo by default
2016-03-25 23:56:19	Neocraftz1553	or something like that for the fangame name
2016-03-25 23:56:34	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-25 23:56:40	@Espyo	it's like Super Demo World

2016-03-25 23:57:22	@Espyo	>Demo World is a hack to demonstrate how well Lunar Magic can modify Super Mario World.
2016-03-25 23:57:31	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-25 23:57:39	Neocraftz1553	I use Lunar magic
2016-03-25 23:57:49	@Espyo	just replace "Demo World" with "Demo fangame", "Lunar Magic" with "Pikmin fangame engine", and "modify Super Mario World" with "make Pikmin fangames"
2016-03-25 23:57:50	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-03-25 23:57:51	Neocraftz1553	it is awsome, but it has its limitations
2016-03-25 23:57:56	@Espyo	I used to play around with it a lot back in the day
2016-03-25 23:58:04	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-25 23:58:07	@Espyo	really? it's one of the most flexible editors I've seen in my life
2016-03-25 23:58:08	Neocraftz1553	its fun
2016-03-25 23:58:13	@Espyo	at least in terms of ROM hacks
2016-03-25 23:58:21	@Espyo	it allows you to edit so much, I was overwhelmed when I first saw it
2016-03-25 23:58:30	Neocraftz1553	specially when you put bonzai bills at the end of the level
2016-03-25 23:58:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it is EXTREMELY flexible
2016-03-25 23:59:03	Neocraftz1553	but it cannot... do this one thing that I tried doing....
2016-03-25 23:59:06	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-25 23:59:37	Neocraftz1553	I don't know, but the whole level was a garble of sprites after I did this one thing...
2016-03-25 23:59:46	@Espyo	hm, weird
2016-03-25 23:59:53	Neocraftz1553	but anyways, it is pretty awsome...
2016-03-25 23:59:58	Neocraftz1553	if you have the time
2016-03-26 00:00:22	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:00:31	@Espyo	it's Super Mario Maker before Super Mario Maker
2016-03-26 00:01:09	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as Chiaki_Nanappy
2016-03-26 00:01:23	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-26 00:01:51	Neocraftz1553	Its amazing just seeing how many games were made with that editor
2016-03-26 00:01:58	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-26 00:02:07	Neocraftz1553	I mean, they made Super Pika Land...
2016-03-26 00:02:13	Neocraftz1553	Chocolate Version...
2016-03-26 00:02:35	@Espyo	the millions of Kaizo roms...
2016-03-26 00:04:04	Neocraftz1553	gotta love chocolate
2016-03-26 00:04:08	Neocraftz1553	I don't know much about the games, or their names...
2016-03-26 00:04:08	Neocraftz1553	but one day I was thinking, hmm... I wonder if someone made a Pikmin game editor or even MAKER...
2016-03-26 00:04:08	Neocraftz1553	then I remembered...
2016-03-26 00:04:13	Neocraftz1553	You were going to make a Pikmin game maker
2016-03-26 00:04:34	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-26 00:04:39	Neocraftz1553	so then I came back to Pikminfanon, and hoped you didn't drop the project
2016-03-26 00:05:09	Neocraftz1553	then 2 years later, I'm still here
2016-03-26 00:05:18	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:05:20	Neocraftz1553	time flies, doesn't it?
2016-03-26 00:05:24	@Espyo	sure does
2016-03-26 00:05:34	@Espyo	to think, I didn't even have Pikmin 3 when I started the engine
2016-03-26 00:05:38	@Espyo	wait, was the game even OUT back then?
2016-03-26 00:05:46	@Espyo	[[f:Pikmin fangame engine]]

2016-03-26 00:05:49	Testyo	"Pikmin_3" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_3
2016-03-26 00:06:08	@Espyo	it was releasing...
2016-03-26 00:06:22	@Espyo	I started on August 15th, 2013
2016-03-26 00:06:40	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 released in Japan slightly more than one month before that
2016-03-26 00:06:41	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-26 00:06:52	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-26 00:06:52	Neocraftz1553	wow
2016-03-26 00:07:11	Neocraftz1553	I still remember when Rock Pikmin were announced...
2016-03-26 00:07:23	Neocraftz1553	It was awsome, the game looked fresh as water...
2016-03-26 00:07:30	Neocraftz1553	err... crystal...
2016-03-26 00:07:43	Neocraftz1553	but it looked fresh, crisp
2016-03-26 00:07:48	Neocraftz1553	still does
2016-03-26 00:08:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:09:17	Neocraftz1553	but I didn't like the fact that they took out different Rock Pikmin
2016-03-26 00:09:28	Neocraftz1553	still, its a nice game
2016-03-26 00:09:37	@Espyo	I don't think anybody liked that
2016-03-26 00:09:43	@Espyo	they might've done it for performance's sake
2016-03-26 00:09:47	@Espyo	which doesn't make a whole lot of sense
2016-03-26 00:09:50	@Espyo	but they had to have a reason
2016-03-26 00:09:56	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-26 00:10:11	Neocraftz1553	or to make it take up less memory
2016-03-26 00:10:12	Neocraftz1553	you know...
2016-03-26 00:10:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:10:21	Neocraftz1553	with the random generator and stuffs
2016-03-26 00:11:18	Neocraftz1553	but if they did it for storage reasons, they must have had A LOT of different designs...
2016-03-26 00:11:18	Neocraftz1553	that would've been pretty freaking amazing
2016-03-26 00:11:39	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:11:48	@Espyo	hey Neo, one thing
2016-03-26 00:11:54	@Espyo	did you ever get the area editor texture crash again?
2016-03-26 00:12:04	Neocraftz1553	no...
2016-03-26 00:12:10	@Espyo	well, that's good
2016-03-26 00:12:13	@Espyo	and bad, I guess
2016-03-26 00:12:16	Neocraftz1553	not even when I was making the area
2016-03-26 00:12:32	@Espyo	I can see bits in the code where it would crash if certain scenarios happened
2016-03-26 00:12:40	@Espyo	but I can't figure out why those scenarios would happen
2016-03-26 00:12:56	@Espyo	like, if the image it wants to draw is invalid
2016-03-26 00:13:01	Neocraftz1553	hwy, maybe it'll be fixed with all the changes you made...
2016-03-26 00:13:02	Neocraftz1553	but, maybe not...
2016-03-26 00:13:02	Neocraftz1553	me niether 
2016-03-26 00:13:04	@Espyo	I could make it so that if the image is invalid, it doesn't draw it
2016-03-26 00:13:10	@Espyo	but that's not really solving the problem as much as it is masking it
2016-03-26 00:13:29	@Espyo	I haven't touched that part of the area editor, so I don't think it'll get fixed, I'm afraid
2016-03-26 00:13:57	Neocraftz1553	Its ok...
2016-03-26 00:14:13	Neocraftz1553	not ok for people who forget to save often though...
2016-03-26 00:14:17	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-26 00:14:22	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-26 00:14:44	Neocraftz1553	maybe its just me, hopefully if someone gets the crash they report it
2016-03-26 00:14:57	@Espyo	do you remember ever typing a really weird name on the texture box?
2016-03-26 00:15:09	@Espyo	like just a dot, or a space, or a lot of random letters...?
2016-03-26 00:15:30	Neocraftz1553	oh, a space
2016-03-26 00:15:45	Neocraftz1553	it was 
2016-03-26 00:16:23	Neocraftz1553	Dirt 5.jpg
2016-03-26 00:16:33	@Espyo	oh, I meant a name that is ONLY a space

2016-03-26 00:16:36	@Espyo	or only a dot
2016-03-26 00:16:36	Neocraftz1553	I think
2016-03-26 00:16:37	Neocraftz1553	yeah, must've been
2016-03-26 00:16:38	Neocraftz1553	or Grass 3.jpg
2016-03-26 00:16:39	Neocraftz1553	it did have a space though
2016-03-26 00:16:41	Neocraftz1553	hm..
2016-03-26 00:16:48	@Espyo	but I mean a name that ONLY contains a space and nothing else
2016-03-26 00:17:34	Neocraftz1553	let me try that
2016-03-26 00:17:34	Neocraftz1553	nah
2016-03-26 00:17:34	Neocraftz1553	tried only dot, space, and kjhvcxzsnmf
2016-03-26 00:17:42	@Espyo	hm
2016-03-26 00:17:47	@Espyo	yeah, no problems on my end either
2016-03-26 00:18:33	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-26 00:18:37	Neocraftz1553	I don't know..
2016-03-26 00:18:44	Neocraftz1553	it seems random...
2016-03-26 00:18:49	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-26 00:18:54	Neocraftz1553	I hate those kinds of bugs

2016-03-26 00:19:51	Neocraftz1553	heh, I know what it feels like
2016-03-26 00:19:57	Neocraftz1553	They don't. have a pattern, they like being unique
2016-03-26 00:21:56	Neocraftz1553	there have been times when programming the game just crashes
2016-03-26 00:21:56	Neocraftz1553	unexpectedly 
2016-03-26 00:23:05	Neocraftz1553	yes, I program...
2016-03-26 00:25:20	@Espyo	what languages?
2016-03-26 00:25:40	Neocraftz1553	JavaScript
2016-03-26 00:25:53	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2016-03-26 00:25:55	@Espyo	made any games?
2016-03-26 00:25:57	Neocraftz1553	trying to learn it
2016-03-26 00:25:58	Neocraftz1553	and C++
2016-03-26 00:26:03	Neocraftz1553	and normal C
2016-03-26 00:26:11	Neocraftz1553	games...
2016-03-26 00:26:16	Neocraftz1553	kinda
2016-03-26 00:26:27	Neocraftz1553	I do some test stuff, but not real games
2016-03-26 00:26:30	Neocraftz1553	yet
2016-03-26 00:27:10	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-26 00:27:12	@Espyo	that's the spirit
2016-03-26 00:27:50	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-26 00:28:25	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2016-03-26 00:31:24	Neocraftz1553	hey, do the captains have to be so close to the active one?
2016-03-26 00:32:03	@Espyo	eh, guess so
2016-03-26 00:32:09	@Espyo	I'll fix it some day in the future
2016-03-26 00:32:12	@Espyo	they also share the same spot
2016-03-26 00:32:53	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-26 00:32:55	Neocraftz1553	they are breaking the law of physics
2016-03-26 00:32:55	Neocraftz1553	or something like that
2016-03-26 00:33:58	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:34:01	Neocraftz1553	dang, my map looks so damn cool
2016-03-26 00:34:42	Neocraftz1553	specially at night
2016-03-26 00:34:42	Neocraftz1553	I mean, its dim, hard to see stuff..
2016-03-26 00:34:53	Neocraftz1553	but it looks like the Forest Navel at night
2016-03-26 00:34:55	Neocraftz1553	with the light at the landing site
2016-03-26 00:36:02	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-26 00:36:49	Neocraftz1553	hey, engine updates 0.1-1.0 let you make maps like in the canon games
2016-03-26 00:37:12	Neocraftz1553	you know, carrying paths...
2016-03-26 00:37:19	Neocraftz1553	plant...
2016-03-26 00:37:19	Neocraftz1553	hazards...
2016-03-26 00:37:19	Neocraftz1553	mobs...
2016-03-26 00:37:34	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 00:41:24	Neocraftz1553	are you going to give the updates names?
2016-03-26 00:41:24	Neocraftz1553	The hazardous update...
2016-03-26 00:41:24	Neocraftz1553	The Aquatic update...
2016-03-26 00:41:24	Neocraftz1553	The Foilage update...
2016-03-26 00:41:29	Neocraftz1553	stuff like that
2016-03-26 00:41:30	Neocraftz1553	then theres birthday update
2016-03-26 00:41:30	Neocraftz1553	um...
2016-03-26 00:41:35	Neocraftz1553	are Pikmin supposedto get stuck in non-sectors like that?
2016-03-26 00:42:11	@Espyo	eh
2016-03-26 00:42:11	Neocraftz1553	a blue got pushed into an out of bounds place
2016-03-26 00:42:15	@Espyo	I guess I didn't name this last one
2016-03-26 00:42:17	@Espyo	so combo breaker
2016-03-26 00:42:20	@Espyo	hm, or did I?
2016-03-26 00:42:22	@Espyo	the path update
2016-03-26 00:42:24	@Espyo	yeah, I guess
2016-03-26 00:42:38	@Espyo	did the Blue get pushed by an enemy?
2016-03-26 00:42:38	Neocraftz1553	The trails update
2016-03-26 00:42:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-26 00:42:49	@Espyo	yeah, enemies are very aggressive with pushing
2016-03-26 00:42:53	@Espyo	I fixed that here
2016-03-26 00:42:56	@Espyo	well, 99%
2016-03-26 00:42:56	Neocraftz1553	The are pushy
2016-03-26 00:43:02	Neocraftz1553	good enough
2016-03-26 00:43:07	@Espyo	in specific scenarios, with too many enemies, it's still possible to clip through walls
2016-03-26 00:43:21	@Espyo	it sucks, but then I remember that in Pikmin 3, you can just grab a leader, turn so your back is against a wall, and release
2016-03-26 00:43:23	@Espyo	and the leader falls right through
2016-03-26 00:43:33	@Espyo	so suddenly I stop feeling so bad about my 1%-chance glitches
2016-03-26 00:43:35	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-26 00:43:44	@Espyo	plus it depends a bit on the map maker too
2016-03-26 00:43:51	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-26 00:43:53	@Espyo	in general, you shouldn't have tight spaces with several enemies that can push you around
2016-03-26 00:43:54	Neocraftz1553	it really does
2016-03-26 00:44:02	@Espyo	if you do, you're just asking trouble, so of course the engine will give you trouble
2016-03-26 00:44:25	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-26 00:44:58	Neocraftz1553	well, its not like anyone likes 100 dwarf reds shoved into a 2 x 2 sector
2016-03-26 00:45:07	Neocraftz1553	the engine especially hates that
2016-03-26 00:45:28	Neocraftz1553	I don't think the framerate likes that either...
2016-03-26 00:46:09	Neocraftz1553	oh, and can you make enemies that fall into a pit die and dissapear...
2016-03-26 00:46:24	Neocraftz1553	I had some dwarf reds still eating pikmin in a pit
2016-03-26 00:46:37	Neocraftz1553	they were really tiny...
2016-03-26 00:46:41	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-26 00:46:47	@Espyo	you shouldn't make pits that large
2016-03-26 00:46:56	@Espyo	otherwise it takes forever before it registers the fall and that they died
2016-03-26 00:46:59	@Espyo	but I digress
2016-03-26 00:47:12	@Espyo	I thought enemy death was working
2016-03-26 00:47:16	@Espyo	I'll look into it tomorrow
2016-03-26 00:47:18	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-26 00:47:19	Neocraftz1553	they die?
2016-03-26 00:47:31	@Espyo	when they fall in the pit, yeah
2016-03-26 00:47:35	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-26 00:47:42	Neocraftz1553	wait, lemme see
2016-03-26 00:47:53	@Espyo	at least they SHOULD
2016-03-26 00:48:03	Neocraftz1553	uh...
2016-03-26 00:48:17	Neocraftz1553	not unless they get stuck in a walk animation

2016-03-26 00:48:33	@Espyo	yeah, same thing that's happening to me
2016-03-26 00:48:35	@Espyo	no death
2016-03-26 00:48:39	@Espyo	I'll look into it tomorrow
2016-03-26 00:49:18	@Espyo	weird, they're also registering as falling into the pit instantly
2016-03-26 00:49:22	@Espyo	...oh, of course they are
2016-03-26 00:49:23	@Espyo	drat
2016-03-26 00:49:25	@Espyo	gotta fix that
2016-03-26 00:49:30	@Espyo	don't worry, it won't happen to you
2016-03-26 00:49:32	@Espyo	but it is happening to me
2016-03-26 00:49:41	@Espyo	with the fix that stops Pikmin from getting stuck in their thrown animation
2016-03-26 00:49:46	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-26 00:49:47	Neocraftz1553	G'night then?

2016-03-26 00:49:54	@Espyo	I accidentally made pits instantly detected, even if you don't really touch them
2016-03-26 00:50:00	@Espyo	yeah, I'll get going

2016-03-26 09:56:23	Marty2000	I'm making a video about the "odd" evolution of Pikmin in Pikmin 3. I tested this in different areas. In story mode, it's always constant, but in Mission Mode, it always changes...

2016-03-26 12:12:26	Testyo	Hey everyone!
2016-03-26 12:13:23	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-03-26 12:13:23	Testyo	what are in his site, ready to be downloaded
2016-03-26 12:14:56	@Espyo	hi
2016-03-26 12:15:25	Yoshi2	I'm looking at extreme programming, and it's far too extreme for me
2016-03-26 12:16:41	@Espyo	I remember learning about that
2016-03-26 12:17:04	@Espyo	I think I just discarded that like I discarded most development cycle methods: into the "wtf are you doing programming"
2016-03-26 12:17:56	Yoshi2	some ideas of this are nice
2016-03-26 12:17:59	Yoshi2	like unit tests
2016-03-26 12:18:03	Yoshi2	I think I should do more tests
2016-03-26 12:21:39	 *	@Espyo brings up the XKCD comic
2016-03-26 12:31:52	Yoshi2	Espyo: where is the xkcd comic you promised
2016-03-26 12:33:17	@Espyo	it's rhetorical
2016-03-26 12:33:30	@Espyo	in the sense that you have to accept like I posted it, without me going through the trouble of finding it
2016-03-26 12:36:04	Yoshi2	I am not even sure which comic you are referencing so I can't even look for it myself
2016-03-26 12:36:31	@Espyo	damn
2016-03-26 12:36:36	@Espyo	well, it's the one with the chart
2016-03-26 12:36:47	@Espyo	for the amount of time you spend setting something up to save you time in the long run
2016-03-26 12:36:49	@Espyo	vs doing it yourself
2016-03-26 12:36:57	@Espyo	setting up unit tests versus doing tests yourself
2016-03-26 12:37:35	Yoshi2	but
2016-03-26 12:37:39	Yoshi2	that's automatisation
2016-03-26 12:38:27	@Espyo	what are unit tests if not automatizing human-made tests?
2016-03-26 12:39:30	Yoshi2	well, I guess "let's change this and hope it does't break" saves a lot of time over writing proper unit tests
2016-03-26 12:42:53	@Espyo	of course
2016-03-26 12:42:58	@Espyo	is it more efficient or safe?
2016-03-26 12:42:59	@Espyo	not necessarily
2016-03-26 12:43:03	@Espyo	but hell if it doesn't save time
2016-03-26 12:43:51	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is a plugin that replaces scrum with scrub
2016-03-26 12:44:30	Yoshi2	"The Scrub Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrub Master." 
2016-03-26 12:44:42	Yoshi2	meh, not as funny as the cloud->butt thing
2016-03-26 12:44:57	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 12:45:04	@Espyo	this ALSO has a relevant KXCD comic
2016-03-26 12:45:10	@Espyo	I remember one that replaced some keywords with other ones
2016-03-26 12:45:18	@Espyo	and you know what, making such a script is pretty darn easy
2016-03-26 12:46:38	Yoshi2	the Product Owner is a glorified guy with a todo list
2016-03-26 12:50:12	Yoshi2	the dev team is your average dev team
2016-03-26 12:51:35	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-26 12:51:35	Yoshi2	and the scrum master preaches the scrum ideology
2016-03-26 12:52:34	Yoshi2	this is some fanatic stuff right here

2016-03-26 13:43:25	Yoshi2	one € is like a million yen so you are probably rip
2016-03-26 13:44:08	Klemen702	this begs the question

2016-03-26 13:44:23	Klemen702	for the most wide ones atleast
2016-03-26 13:44:26	Klemen702	5€
2016-03-26 13:44:26	Testyo	5 € = £ 3.533  / $ 5.436

2016-03-26 13:45:45	Testyo	3 € = £ 2.1198  / $ 3.2616 
2016-03-26 13:46:49	Marty2000	I think 1 euro is something like 100 japanese yen
2016-03-26 13:46:50	Testyo	1 Euro = £ 0.7066  / $ 1.0872 
2016-03-26 13:47:05	Klemen702	the strangest part
2016-03-26 13:47:11	Klemen702	chinese use yuan
2016-03-26 13:47:18	Marty2000	Yes
2016-03-26 13:47:27	Klemen702	and it has the same symbol
2016-03-26 13:47:43	Klemen702	i can't tell if they have the same currency
2016-03-26 13:47:45	Klemen702	or a different one
2016-03-26 13:49:06	Marty2000	During the 12th century, the chinese money was used in Japan
2016-03-26 13:49:17	Marty2000	Until the 17th century
2016-03-26 13:51:40	Klemen702	welp
2016-03-26 13:51:43	Klemen702	that's that then
2016-03-26 13:52:20	Marty2000	But they don't have the same currency anyway
2016-03-26 13:52:30	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-26 13:52:41	Marty2000	8 yuans = 1 euro (more or less)*
2016-03-26 13:52:41	Testyo	1 Euro = £ 0.7066  / $ 1.0872 
2016-03-26 13:52:53	Marty2000	100 yen = 1 euro (more or less)
2016-03-26 13:52:54	Testyo	100 Yen = 0.8 € / £ 0.6  / $ 1.1 
2016-03-26 13:53:04	Marty2000	Thansk Testyo
2016-03-26 13:53:04	Testyo	also, I have to swerve that way
2016-03-26 13:54:01	Marty2000	Well, 127 yen= 1 euro nowadays
2016-03-26 13:54:02	Testyo	1 Euro = £ 0.7066  / $ 1.0872

2016-03-26 14:57:20	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-03-26 14:57:44	Marty2000	Hi!
2016-03-26 14:59:41	Scruffy	I'm going to share the area I've made in PFE, so anyone can try and explore it
2016-03-26 15:03:01	@Espyo	oh wow heh
2016-03-26 15:08:25	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlCL4drFg WOAH
2016-03-26 15:08:32	Marty2000	By the way, I'm uploading a video about the Pikmin evolution in Pikmin 3 (what we talked about yesterday). Too bad it's being uploaded because I found out that they evolve diffrently depending on where you go and what you do (in Mission Mode only)
2016-03-26 15:08:49	Marty2000	Wow
2016-03-26 15:09:09	Marty2000	How could this happen?
2016-03-26 15:09:20	@Espyo	looks like some shaders gone awry
2016-03-26 15:10:33	Scruffy	That's PIkmin 3?
2016-03-26 15:10:38	@Espyo	or what's left of it
2016-03-26 15:10:58	@Espyo	Marty2000: so, it depends on what you do in the map? that's so weird...
2016-03-26 15:12:13	Scruffy	Well first of all it seems like they have a massive gamma exposure problem
2016-03-26 15:12:14	Marty2000	It seems. For example, I had a group of 10 Purples which had never evolved into flower (every try)... but I just tried to pluck 5 of them and they finally evolved into bud
2016-03-26 15:12:54	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-26 15:12:56	Marty2000	I wonder if he has just bought the game
2016-03-26 15:13:25	Marty2000	Or if he played it for a while and didn't have this problem
2016-03-26 15:13:48	Scruffy	I want to experience that now
2016-03-26 15:13:58	Scruffy	Try playing the game in this crazy world
2016-03-26 15:14:21	@Espyo	there's that one guy with the broken copy of Smash 4
2016-03-26 15:14:25	@Espyo	in which the models come from hell
2016-03-26 15:14:29	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2016-03-26 15:14:30	@Espyo	maybe this is a similar thing
2016-03-26 15:15:18	Scruffy	Even in glitch world Pikmin 3 still is great at directing your attention to the important parts
2016-03-26 15:15:28	Scruffy	You obviously go to the right
2016-03-26 15:17:02	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-03-26 15:17:15	@Espyo	I can... vaguely make out some things
2016-03-26 15:17:32	@Espyo	the colors being messed up, that I can kinda understand
2016-03-26 15:17:39	@Espyo	but those broken image sections on the left
2016-03-26 15:17:44	@Espyo	looks like a graphics card problem
2016-03-26 15:17:58	@Espyo	if it were just the colors, I honestly would just say it's a shader problem
2016-03-26 15:18:05	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-26 15:18:34	Scruffy	It's art, as it is
2016-03-26 15:18:47	@Espyo	mhm
2016-03-26 15:18:53	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlBZ9RPFw okay, I can't tell if this one is an actual glitch
2016-03-26 15:19:02	@Espyo	or if that thing is just the bulb you get as a spoil, and it's acting normal
2016-03-26 15:19:32	Scruffy	That looks like the normal bulb
2016-03-26 15:19:46	@Espyo	same, honestly
2016-03-26 15:19:51	Scruffy	That's not where the Toady Bloyster spawns
2016-03-26 15:20:07	Scruffy	It wouldn't make it on the shore like that
2016-03-26 15:20:24	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-26 15:21:21	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/17/ZlCfzREdl2EMMU6nqn.jpg yeah, it's just the bulb
2016-03-26 15:21:35	@Espyo	I can't see the leaf things near the base of the bulb's stem
2016-03-26 15:21:46	@Espyo	and the shadow it makes on the floor should include the full enemy
2016-03-26 15:22:04	@Espyo	that's normally how shadows work, if something is under the ground, its shadow still appears above, on ground
2016-03-26 15:22:06	@Espyo	plus what you said
2016-03-26 15:22:53	Scruffy	Actually, in P3 shadows are accurate, if something's under the ground you won't see the shadow
2016-03-26 15:23:19	@Espyo	oh really?
2016-03-26 15:23:21	@Espyo	nice
2016-03-26 15:23:28	@Espyo	how do you know? how often are things under the ground?
2016-03-26 15:24:09	Yoshi2	the ground is so flat, it hurts
2016-03-26 15:24:53	Scruffy	when leaders or Pikmin glitch under the ground, I've been able to see they no longer cast a shadow
2016-03-26 15:25:16	Scruffy	Shadows are calculated realtime in P3
2016-03-26 15:26:38	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-26 15:26:39	@Espyo	very nice
2016-03-26 15:29:06	Scruffy	<Yoshi2>: the ground is so flat, it hurts
2016-03-26 15:29:09	Scruffy	I knowww
2016-03-26 15:29:21	Scruffy	That's probably the biggest disappointment I had with P3
2016-03-26 15:29:26	Scruffy	There's no anti-aliasing
2016-03-26 15:29:55	Yoshi2	isn't anti aliasing for edges of models?
2016-03-26 15:30:00	Scruffy	Yes
2016-03-26 15:30:21	Scruffy	It organizes how pixels render oblique angles
2016-03-26 15:31:02	Scruffy	So that they don't try to maintain all the detail you see when viewing a texture head-on
2016-03-26 15:31:43	Scruffy	Without it, pixels always try to keep the texture as detailed as possible, so from a near-parallel viewing angle it looks really muddy
2016-03-26 15:32:36	Scruffy	Wait a minute, no 
2016-03-26 15:32:47	Scruffy	That's anisotropy
2016-03-26 15:32:59	Scruffy	Never mind, I mistook anisotropy for anti-aliasing
2016-03-26 15:33:21	Yoshi2	heh yeah, you confused me for a bit there
2016-03-26 15:33:29	@Espyo	^
2016-03-26 15:34:07	Yoshi2	but the screenshots look like the ground textures just aren't highres enough so it looks muddy close-up
2016-03-26 15:34:42	Scruffy	True as well; a lot of them are still textures meant for the Wii, not the Wii U
2016-03-26 15:36:39	Testyo	it'd probably not HARD
2016-03-26 15:37:22	Yoshi2	maybe pikmin 4 will appear on the nx
2016-03-26 15:38:12	Scruffy	I really hope the nx can raytrace, that'd be so cool
2016-03-26 15:38:51	Scruffy	But that takes a really powerful processor, that I imagine would be seriously expensive to mass-produce like that
2016-03-26 15:39:06	Scruffy	Not to mention hard to program in a game
2016-03-26 15:39:52	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-26 15:45:59	Scruffy	Okay, let me know if this work

2016-03-26 15:47:04	Scruffy	It's the PFE area, in case anyone's wondering
2016-03-26 15:47:09	Scruffy	I should have made that clear
2016-03-26 15:51:02	@Espyo	heh, I knew because of the name
2016-03-26 15:51:05	@Espyo	and yeah, the download works
2016-03-26 15:51:09	Scruffy	Great!
2016-03-26 15:53:34	@Espyo	when your PC loads the area so quickly you didn't catch the area's subtitle
2016-03-26 15:53:48	Scruffy	Heh, it just says "Sprout an army!"
2016-03-26 15:54:21	@Espyo	...wow
2016-03-26 15:54:31	@Espyo	this is the first time in ages I'm actually using the engine in a detached way
2016-03-26 15:54:36	@Espyo	like, not for feature testing or bugfixing
2016-03-26 15:54:38	Scruffy	heh
2016-03-26 15:54:40	@Espyo	I'm playing it to /play/
2016-03-26 15:54:43	@Espyo	and in just 10 seconds
2016-03-26 15:54:45	@Espyo	I found out so much
2016-03-26 15:55:01	@Espyo	like how instinctively tried to punch the Sheargrubs while my Pikmin were fighting
2016-03-26 15:55:21	@Espyo	and how I didn't realize at first that the 5 red pellet is too far high to reach
2016-03-26 15:55:25	@Espyo	this is any game desi--
2016-03-26 15:55:27	@Espyo	uh
2016-03-26 15:55:34	@Espyo	the Dwarf Red Bulborb pushed the pellet out of the way
2016-03-26 15:55:37	@Espyo	oh god he's in the base
2016-03-26 15:55:39	@Espyo	I shouldn't be typing
2016-03-26 15:55:41	@Espyo	I should be fighting
2016-03-26 15:55:44	@Espyo	but he seems harmless
2016-03-26 15:55:45	@Espyo	he's stuck
2016-03-26 15:55:47	@Espyo	well, free food
2016-03-26 15:56:18	@Espyo	anyway...
2016-03-26 15:56:22	@Espyo	this is any game designer's dream
2016-03-26 15:56:30	@Espyo	to know what goes on in the minds of a player
2016-03-26 15:56:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-26 15:57:03	Scruffy	I considered coloring parts that only Yellow Pikmin can reach yellow
2016-03-26 15:57:41	@Espyo	woah this is a big area
2016-03-26 15:58:40	@Espyo	I'm sure I can find some way to make it clear what ledges are high and what ledges aren't
2016-03-26 15:58:52	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-26 15:59:02	@Espyo	the problem with the red 5 pellet near the landing site being where it is
2016-03-26 15:59:09	@Espyo	Pikmin carrying stuff through the bridge will push it
2016-03-26 15:59:19	Scruffy	Oh, yeah
2016-03-26 15:59:25	Scruffy	I see that
2016-03-26 15:59:33	@Espyo	oh good, Pikmin can grab stuff in mid-air lol
2016-03-26 15:59:38	@Espyo	that's a glitch I won't fix
2016-03-26 15:59:44	@Espyo	since it just solved the pellet from being stuck there
2016-03-26 15:59:56	@Espyo	also another suggestion: make it a bit less cramped next time
2016-03-26 16:00:02	@Espyo	Pikmin sometimes just BARELY fit where they need to go
2016-03-26 16:00:10	Scruffy	Ah, okay
2016-03-26 16:00:13	@Espyo	if you want to cross the same path the Pikmin are taking, you won't squeeze through
2016-03-26 16:00:41	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-26 16:00:48	Scruffy	Duly noted
2016-03-26 16:01:25	@Espyo	damn, the time limit
2016-03-26 16:01:38	@Espyo	the engine looks neat at night... but not very playable
2016-03-26 16:01:46	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-03-26 16:01:56	Scruffy	I just advise not to care about the time limit
2016-03-26 16:02:03	Scruffy	This area is mainly for exploring so far
2016-03-26 16:02:09	Scruffy	Not really a goal
2016-03-26 16:02:30	@Espyo	right
2016-03-26 16:03:03	@Espyo	damn, wall shadows are glitchy at times
2016-03-26 16:03:11	@Espyo	on the room where the Cloaking Burrow-nit is
2016-03-26 16:03:31	Scruffy	oh
2016-03-26 16:03:51	@Espyo	yikes, they're really weird on the gate after the bridge
2016-03-26 16:05:28	Scruffy	Aw man
2016-03-26 16:05:41	@Espyo	I'll have to clean up that code one day
2016-03-26 16:07:04	@Espyo	woah what the?
2016-03-26 16:07:10	@Espyo	a pellet just spawned on top of me
2016-03-26 16:07:15	Scruffy	Huh?
2016-03-26 16:07:24	Scruffy	Where?
2016-03-26 16:07:27	@Espyo	did it fall into a pit?
2016-03-26 16:07:32	@Espyo	I'm kinda confused
2016-03-26 16:07:35	@Espyo	not quite sure what that was
2016-03-26 16:07:45	Scruffy	where did it happen?
2016-03-26 16:08:01	@Espyo	wait, that was the red 5 pellet on a high ledge that also has a gate
2016-03-26 16:08:15	Scruffy	Weird
2016-03-26 16:10:27	Scruffy	I have no explanation
2016-03-26 16:10:36	@Espyo	same...
2016-03-26 16:10:53	@Espyo	well, that was a fun play
2016-03-26 16:10:57	@Espyo	pretty nice, Scruffy!
2016-03-26 16:10:59	Scruffy	Thank you!
2016-03-26 16:11:10	@Espyo	hm, plucking definitely needs to be faster, yikes
2016-03-26 16:11:25	Scruffy	Yeah, this'll definitely go through more iterations, especially as the engine is updated
2016-03-26 16:11:42	@Espyo	right
2016-03-26 16:11:43	Scruffy	But thank you for testing it!

2016-03-26 16:23:08	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, do you think procedural generation will ever happen in PFE?
2016-03-26 16:23:27	@Espyo	at most, [[cave unit]]-based generation

2016-03-26 16:25:39	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-26 16:25:58	Neocraftz1553	just terrain-based generation?
2016-03-26 16:26:06	Neocraftz1553	or unit-based?
2016-03-26 16:26:12	@Espyo	just unit
2016-03-26 16:26:24	@Espyo	I'll never even try to implement proper terrain-based generation
2016-03-26 16:26:26	Neocraftz1553	Oh, ok
2016-03-26 16:26:40	Neocraftz1553	heh, too hard
2016-03-26 16:26:50	Neocraftz1553	well, actually...
2016-03-26 16:27:44	Neocraftz1553	we don't know if it'll be easier later on... I mean I could probably try to do something like enemy generation...
2016-03-26 16:28:12	@Espyo	eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhh
2016-03-26 16:28:13	@Espyo	maybe
2016-03-26 16:28:24	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-26 16:28:35	Neocraftz1553	hard, but not impossible
2016-03-26 16:30:37	Neocraftz1553	hey how old is the GameCube 
2016-03-26 16:31:02	@Espyo	okay, I'm afraid I'll have to leave in this new bug
2016-03-26 16:31:13	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-03-26 16:31:22	@Espyo	where going into a bottomless pit sector instantly triggers the abyssness
2016-03-26 16:31:28	@Espyo	you can throw something over the sector
2016-03-26 16:31:38	@Espyo	but if you're on solid ground and you peek over the bottomless pit, you die right away
2016-03-26 16:31:48	@Espyo	it's too much of a pain to fix in a simple bugfixing patch version
2016-03-26 16:31:55	@Espyo	I'll have to leave it till 8.0
2016-03-26 16:32:11	Neocraftz1553	I don't think people are going to try to peek over it twice...
2016-03-26 16:32:37	@Espyo	heh

2016-03-26 17:04:23	Marty2000	I don't know why but the more I study the evolution of Pikmin in Mission Mode, the more it confirms that they evolve depending on what the player does... I'll make a second video about this later but I want the first video to be uploaded, first (35 minutes left). It's really strange because there's no real explanation to that behaviour...
2016-03-26 17:05:05	@Espyo	yeah, it's really bizarre
2016-03-26 17:05:20	Marty2000	And if I do nothing (don't move), the results are similar (groups which do not evolve) but never constant (times are diffreent)
2016-03-26 17:05:24	Marty2000	different*

2016-03-26 18:15:07	@Espyo	working on it as we speak

2016-03-26 18:15:18	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-26 18:15:23	@Espyo	it takes 5 minutes to compile on windows... ASSUMING it compiles right the first time

2016-03-26 19:18:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-26 19:18:32	Neocraftz1553	because you usually want Pikmin that are idle to detect tasks farther...
2016-03-26 19:18:37	Neocraftz1553	or at least I do...
2016-03-26 19:19:25	Neocraftz1553	and theres more sounds

2016-03-26 20:13:11	Marty2000	And there's absolutely nothing about the Pikmin maturity in the game's files?

2016-03-26 20:30:11	Marty2000	I took your screenshot for the montage
2016-03-26 20:38:19	@Espyo	there's no need for a montage
2016-03-26 20:38:24	@Espyo	in general, we should avoid using montages
2016-03-26 20:38:39	@Espyo	galleries serve a better purpose for comparing several different things
2016-03-26 20:38:45	@Espyo	and it's easier to categorize and everything
2016-03-26 20:39:16	@Espyo	but in this case, it's best if you upload the icons for the Hocotatian leaders in a separate image
2016-03-26 20:39:28	@Espyo	specially because the images on that article show examples of how the HUD is
2016-03-26 20:39:37	@Espyo	and for there to suddenly be an image that doesn't reflect the in-game HUD... it's kinda weird
2016-03-26 20:39:38	Marty2000	Ok
2016-03-26 20:44:29	Marty2000	I made a montage first because there's a template with "Add an image of every game's version of every HUD element" but since I know montages are not recommended, I didn't know what to do so I prefered asked. Is this screenshot better?http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/12/1459024917-hocotatians.png 
2016-03-26 20:44:36	Marty2000	prefered to ask*
2016-03-26 20:47:23	@Espyo	yeah, that's better
2016-03-26 20:47:35	@Espyo	but it's probably not a good idea to put it next to the existing Alph-Brittany-Charlie image
2016-03-26 20:47:39	@Espyo	otherwise that section will get too cramped
2016-03-26 20:47:43	@Espyo	put it on the gallery
2016-03-26 20:47:49	@Espyo	also you can probably clean up the bottom-right part to be all black

2016-03-27 12:52:44	Yoshi2	pikmin adventure doesn't even have much of a HUD, iirc
2016-03-27 12:54:56	Marty2000	Yes but I think the main article misses a few things (names of the levels, vegetation that's not explained by Monita, and some HUD).  
2016-03-27 12:57:38	@Espyo	not just that, the enemy articles we have are trash
2016-03-27 12:59:37	Marty2000	Yes, but sadly we can't add much more information since there's nothing in-gale
2016-03-27 12:59:42	Marty2000	game*
2016-03-27 13:00:19	@Espyo	I meant more about organization
2016-03-27 13:00:22	@Espyo	the articles are all over the place
2016-03-27 13:00:27	@Espyo	some are missing strategy and such
2016-03-27 13:00:45	Marty2000	Ah
2016-03-27 13:00:49	Marty2000	Yes
2016-03-27 13:06:06	Marty2000	I have just noticed the center of Pikmin's flowers is not yellow for Blues and Reds in Pikmin Adventure. That's cool
2016-03-27 13:07:15	@Espyo	hmm

2016-03-27 13:12:40	Klemen702	the fact that they don't have yellow on their flowers is heartbreaking
2016-03-27 13:12:48	Klemen702	those lazy devs ruined the expirience
2016-03-27 13:13:57	@Espyo	yeeeep.
2016-03-27 13:15:26	Marty2000	It's true it differs from the original games, but I liked the game, even though it's not really a Pikmin game...
2016-03-27 13:20:07	@Espyo	heh, I think most people did
2016-03-27 13:20:14	@Espyo	but it'll never be a game that deserves as much love as the canon ones
2016-03-27 13:20:20	@Espyo	it's fun, but it's not great
2016-03-27 13:20:44	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-03-27 13:21:02	Marty2000	It's still different from the canon games, the atmosphere is different
2016-03-27 13:21:25	@Espyo	lol
2016-03-27 13:21:33	@Espyo	I'm just now watching your video with the rising Winged Pikmin
2016-03-27 13:21:36	@Espyo	suddenly, Olimar out of nowhere
2016-03-27 13:21:39	@Espyo	I love your reaction
2016-03-27 13:21:49	@Espyo	"uhm... what was...? well, I've got a video to record, never mind"
2016-03-27 13:21:55	Marty2000	Ha ha, I was wondering what was happening
2016-03-27 13:23:18	@Espyo	guess we can add that to the wiki
2016-03-27 13:23:24	@Espyo	on like Trivia under the Winged Pikmin article
2016-03-27 13:26:21	Marty2000	Okay. About Pikmin Adventure, I have nearly finished taking screenshots, I have some HUD, some plants, a butterfly, pics from the manual, and others little things
2016-03-27 13:27:11	@Espyo	nice

2016-03-27 13:42:11	@Espyo	hm, might as well, I'd say

2016-03-27 15:20:03	Marty2000	Is it me or nothing can crush Winged Pikmin aside from an Elemental Plasm?
2016-03-27 15:20:22	Marty2000	I never managed to get an enemy crush a Winged Pikmin
2016-03-27 15:20:41	Marty2000	I have never managed to get an enemy*
2016-03-27 15:20:49	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-03-27 15:21:04	@Espyo	I know that Arctic Cannon Larva shots push Wingeds away
2016-03-27 15:21:11	@Espyo	what about normal Cannon Larva boulders?
2016-03-27 15:21:18	Marty2000	The same happens
2016-03-27 15:21:24	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-03-27 15:21:37	@Espyo	I don't think that's on the wiki
2016-03-27 15:21:39	@Espyo	can you add it please?
2016-03-27 15:21:46	@Espyo	but either way, maybe they're just immune to crushing entirely...
2016-03-27 15:21:49	Marty2000	I even tried holding a Winged and get crushed under a boulder, but it manages to survive
2016-03-27 15:21:57	@Espyo	I guess it makes sense for the most part
2016-03-27 15:22:14	@Espyo	like, you only get /crushed/ when two opposite forces crush your body
2016-03-27 15:22:15	Marty2000	The only time I could have a Winged Pikmin crushed is when it got squished by an Elemental Plasm
2016-03-27 15:22:21	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-03-27 15:22:22	@Espyo	for grounded Pikmin, that's the ground and whatever enemy squishes them
2016-03-27 15:22:25	@Espyo	for Winged Pikmin... there's no ground
2016-03-27 15:22:44	@Espyo	well, this needs more research
2016-03-27 15:22:52	@Espyo	Winged Pikmin might just be immune to almost all crushing after all
2016-03-27 15:23:27	Marty2000	Yeah, and that sounds logic
2016-03-27 15:25:12	Marty2000	And it's logic they are crushed by the Elemental Plasm : the cube compresses on the ground
2016-03-27 15:25:40	Marty2000	compresses them*
2016-03-27 15:28:23	Marty2000	Ah, when a Winged Pikmin is pushed away by a Cannon Larva's boulder
2016-03-27 15:28:35	Marty2000	They tend to stay on the ground, without flying
2016-03-27 15:28:44	Marty2000	Usually a few seconds
2016-03-27 15:28:50	Marty2000	They walk
2016-03-27 15:31:11	Marty2000	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69jCwfSgrCY97WO
2016-03-27 15:46:03	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-27 15:46:15	@Espyo	hm, neat
2016-03-27 15:50:17	Marty2000	By the way, under certain circumstances, the Quaggled Mireclops can "crush" Winged and Rock Pikmin (it instantly kills them)
2016-03-27 15:52:56	Testyo	basically, you just want space for all

2016-03-27 16:09:25	Marty2000	There's something I wonder : In Pikmin 2, when a Cloaking Burrow-Nit attacks a Pikmin, something similar to blood can be seen from Pikmin : but what about Bulbmin? I think it's possible to try through hacks
2016-03-27 16:10:14	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-03-27 16:58:46	Marty2000	Rock Pikmin can't get buried by the Elemental Plasm of the Plasmwraith
2016-03-27 16:58:53	Marty2000	That's strange
2016-03-27 17:00:52	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-03-27 17:10:01	Marty2000	By the way, the time it takes for them to unearth seems random (with certain limits). I had 15 Rock Pikmin buried at the same time (5 leaves, 5 buds, and 5 flowers) and they all unearthed  at different times (all in less than 10 seconds, though)
2016-03-27 17:10:15	Marty2000	(http://www.pikminwiki.com/Blunt_force)
2016-03-27 17:11:18	Marty2000	They unearthed between 7 and 10 seconds precisely
2016-03-27 17:11:41	Marty2000	Well, 11 seconds since the last one unearthed at 10.9 seconds
2016-03-27 17:12:52	@Espyo	neat
2016-03-27 17:15:08	Marty2000	"Write down exactly how long Rock Pikmin take to unearth, and check if that's decided by their maturity status." We can say it's not decided by their maturity status and the window of time in which they can unearth varies from 7 to 11 seconds.
2016-03-27 17:15:15	Marty2000	Can I add that to the article?
2016-03-27 17:18:04	@Espyo	yeah

2016-03-27 17:33:30	Marty2000	I think it's also worth adding that WInged Pikmin can't get crushed by anything but the Elemental Plasm. What do you think?
2016-03-27 17:38:28	@Espyo	I agree
2016-03-27 17:38:44	Marty2000	Well, okay, I'll add it.

2016-03-27 20:28:06	Neocraftz1553	looking good Testyo :P

2016-03-27 20:28:11	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-27 20:28:32	Klemen702	question about paths...
2016-03-27 20:28:39	Klemen702	do i have to place the ''stop'' ontop of objects
2016-03-27 20:28:40	Klemen702	and onions
2016-03-27 20:29:35	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-03-27 20:29:42	Neocraftz1553	you can place it anywhere
2016-03-27 20:29:52	Neocraftz1553	just make sure it is possible to follow them...
2016-03-27 20:30:02	Neocraftz1553	and that they don't go into walls
2016-03-27 20:30:11	Neocraftz1553	else pikmin will get stuck
2016-03-27 20:32:51	@Espyo	if you put a stop near an Onion, the Pikmin know to go to that stop, and then make their way to the Onion straight after
2016-03-27 20:33:51	Klemen702	http://pasteboard.co/2AkVSvAd.png is this an average amount?
2016-03-27 20:34:48	@Espyo	well, you can have them like that
2016-03-27 20:34:52	@Espyo	but that's a bit too detailed
2016-03-27 20:34:55	@Espyo	you don't need to make it so smooth
2016-03-27 20:35:02	@Espyo	otherwise it'll take you ages to do all of them
2016-03-27 20:35:07	Klemen702	it's not that i am trying to make it smooth
2016-03-27 20:35:13	Klemen702	it's that i don't know how many i need :P
2016-03-27 20:35:18	Klemen702	which is why i asked if this is average
2016-03-27 20:35:33	@Espyo	they go in a straight line from stop to stop
2016-03-27 20:35:40	@Espyo	so as long as you make sure that between two stops there are no walls
2016-03-27 20:35:49	@Espyo	you can make two stops be at any distance from each other
2016-03-27 20:35:53	@Espyo	no need to set so many so close
2016-03-27 20:35:58	@Espyo	for instance, that branch that goes to the top-right?
2016-03-27 20:36:04	@Espyo	you could just have the stop at the tip of the branch
2016-03-27 20:36:09	@Espyo	and the stop at the junction with the rest of the path
2016-03-27 20:36:13	@Espyo	that'd be enough
2016-03-27 20:36:30	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-27 20:43:34	Neocraftz1553	ok, finished
2016-03-27 20:44:04	Neocraftz1553	zipped and ready tobe uploaded
2016-03-27 20:45:21	Neocraftz1553	It comes with intructions too
2016-03-27 20:45:36	@Espyo	nice
2016-03-27 20:46:35	Neocraftz1553	as if people didn't know how to, but it comes with warnings, so
2016-03-27 20:46:41	Neocraftz1553	you have been warned
2016-03-27 20:46:42	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-27 20:47:15	Neocraftz1553	like "Backup your engine", "Backup this" "Backup that' 
2016-03-27 20:47:31	Neocraftz1553	stuff like that, cause it changes some things
2016-03-27 20:48:00	Neocraftz1553	hitboxes(I think), Data, and the like
2016-03-27 20:48:35	Neocraftz1553	Backup as in Copy/Paste the engine then rename the pasted version into PR_Beta

2016-03-27 20:50:09	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-27 20:50:12	@Espyo	I'll have to see it in action
2016-03-27 20:50:19	@Espyo	I don't think the image did it much justice
2016-03-27 20:50:22	Neocraftz1553	the Spikes?

2016-03-27 21:04:08	Testyo	or doing bottom, it'd be less obtrusive
2016-03-27 21:05:04	Neocraftz1553	That was pretty funny though

2016-03-27 21:05:54	Klemen702	english pronunciation is hard if you are used to a foregin alphabet
2016-03-27 21:06:10	ScruffyChat	and vice versa
2016-03-27 21:06:35	Klemen702	except for english to follow it's alphabet it's also hard
2016-03-27 21:06:39	Klemen702	tough

2016-03-27 23:17:48	Neocraftz1553	hey, Espyo knows more of the engine than I do
2016-03-27 23:18:53	Neocraftz1553	hey, swear

2016-03-27 23:19:11	Testyo	maybe even try to put the tank turret model into the camera about, with Z and R
2016-03-27 23:19:19	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-03-27 23:19:38	Neocraftz1553	swear Klemen

2016-03-27 23:19:54	Klemen702	i think Testyo has a grudge on me
2016-03-27 23:19:55	Testyo	I bet the news about the energy saving was paid for by companies who produce these sockets that doesn't sound right
2016-03-27 23:20:27	Marty2000	Testyo's reactions are always unexpected
2016-03-27 23:20:28	Testyo	also, unless reality changed, replacing strings in Pikmin 2 has to be done with strings of style bad
2016-03-27 23:20:53	ScruffyChat	That just about sums it up
2016-03-27 23:20:55	Klemen702	you need bad strings to replace strings
2016-03-27 23:21:13	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-27 23:23:57	Neocraftz1553	gotta eat

2016-03-27 23:44:24	Neocraftz1553	I could be at a party and you wouldn't even know it
2016-03-27 23:44:45	Klemen702	parties suck
2016-03-27 23:44:57	Neocraftz1553	 80% of the time its people who want to talk and I'm just staring off into space listening to them

2016-03-27 23:45:51	Klemen702	not because i want to spend time like that
2016-03-27 23:45:55	Klemen702	but so i can fix my mother tongue atleast
2016-03-27 23:46:01	Neocraftz1553	now that I think about it, I go days without talkijg...
2016-03-27 23:46:02	Klemen702	it's pretty bad after 24/7 comp

2016-03-27 23:49:11	Neocraftz1553	I probably just say, "sup", "mmhm...", and "not really..."
2016-03-27 23:49:15	Klemen702	i talk a bit
2016-03-27 23:49:23	Neocraftz1553	nice

2016-03-27 23:49:38	Klemen702	yes
2016-03-27 23:49:41	Klemen702	but too little
2016-03-27 23:49:53	Neocraftz1553	hmm....
2016-03-27 23:50:31	Neocraftz1553	when I order food, if no ones at the register, I just stand there looking like an idiot instead of calling someone over..
2016-03-27 23:50:40	Neocraftz1553	and if there is someone...
2016-03-27 23:51:06	Neocraftz1553	"Can I have (order) and thats it..."
2016-03-27 23:51:31	Neocraftz1553	"My name? Neo...."
2016-03-27 23:51:42	Neocraftz1553	yup, sad, sad conversations...
2016-03-27 23:52:02	Klemen702	u go outside atleast
2016-03-27 23:52:04	Klemen702	to order food
2016-03-27 23:52:12	Neocraftz1553	very important
2016-03-27 23:52:46	Neocraftz1553	although the cashiers never heard someone say their name was Neo, so...
2016-03-27 23:52:59	Neocraftz1553	they are usually more confused than not
2016-03-27 23:53:18	Neocraftz1553	so I go to the same places, that way to avoid confusion...
2016-03-27 23:53:37	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-27 23:53:46	Neocraftz1553	yeah...
2016-03-27 23:54:01	Klemen702	honestly
2016-03-27 23:54:07	Neocraftz1553	mhm?
2016-03-27 23:54:08	Klemen702	i would like to spend time outside more
2016-03-27 23:54:11	Klemen702	but idk what to do
2016-03-27 23:54:15	Klemen702	i tried archery once
2016-03-27 23:54:16	Neocraftz1553	draw
2016-03-27 23:54:22	Klemen702	but didn't feel like doing it until later
2016-03-27 23:54:31	Klemen702	i draw on comp if that counts
2016-03-27 23:54:41	Klemen702	it's better for me than using a pencil
2016-03-27 23:54:43	Neocraftz1553	well, you could do that
2016-03-27 23:55:11	Klemen702	''you could''
2016-03-27 23:55:13	Klemen702	i do it
2016-03-27 23:55:15	Klemen702	not could do it
2016-03-27 23:55:16	Klemen702	i do it
2016-03-27 23:55:19	Neocraftz1553	I get inspiration from outside
2016-03-27 23:55:38	Klemen702	http://klemen702.deviantart.com/gallery/ here is my art if you are interested
2016-03-27 23:55:41	Neocraftz1553	Blender, PFE, anything, the outdoors helps me
2016-03-27 23:55:53	Klemen702	atm it's redrawings made in MS paint
2016-03-27 23:55:57	Klemen702	okay
2016-03-27 23:55:59	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-03-27 23:56:14	Klemen702	i'll try seeing if i can see anything outside of help
2016-03-27 23:56:46	ScruffyChat	just taking a walk outside can clear the mind
2016-03-27 23:56:57	ScruffyChat	Especially at a local park or the like
2016-03-27 23:57:18	ScruffyChat	Fresh air, trees, birdsong, it's very wholesome to experience
2016-03-27 23:58:07	Klemen702	for someone as young as me i should be sleeping already...
2016-03-27 23:58:10	Klemen702	almost freaking 1 AM

2016-03-28 00:00:01	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy
2016-03-28 00:00:32	ScruffyChat	Hi
2016-03-28 00:00:46	Neocraftz1553	How did you do the pseudo leaf shade on your renders?
2016-03-28 00:00:58	Neocraftz1553	with the Noise Texture and stuff
2016-03-28 00:01:04	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-03-28 00:01:17	ScruffyChat	I created a large plane far above the scene
2016-03-28 00:01:42	Neocraftz1553	 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I'm listening
2016-03-28 00:01:43	Neocraftz1553	how far uo?
2016-03-28 00:01:43	Neocraftz1553	*up
2016-03-28 00:01:45	ScruffyChat	Gave it a noise texture as a factor to decide between Diffuse and Transparent shaders
2016-03-28 00:01:59	Neocraftz1553	factor...
2016-03-28 00:02:07	ScruffyChat	Normally high up enough to be just barely out of the view of the camera
2016-03-28 00:02:14	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-03-28 00:02:26	ScruffyChat	Right, Mix a Diffuse and totally Transparent shaders
2016-03-28 00:02:29	Neocraftz1553	diffuse, and.... OOOH
2016-03-28 00:02:35	ScruffyChat	And use a Noise texture as a factor
2016-03-28 00:02:45	Neocraftz1553	I get ir
2016-03-28 00:02:47	Neocraftz1553	*it
2016-03-28 00:02:58	ScruffyChat	And then make sure you place the plane so that it casts its shadow on the scene
2016-03-28 00:03:17	Neocraftz1553	so, just outta view
2016-03-28 00:03:20	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-03-28 00:03:37	Neocraftz1553	I see...
2016-03-28 00:03:43	Neocraftz1553	I get it!
2016-03-28 00:03:46	ScruffyChat	And then mess with the "size" of the lamp (preferably sun lamp) to change the harshness of the shadows
2016-03-28 00:03:47	ScruffyChat	Cool!
2016-03-28 00:03:51	Neocraftz1553	where'd you find that?
2016-03-28 00:03:57	ScruffyChat	I just came up with that
2016-03-28 00:04:06	Neocraftz1553	Nice!
2016-03-28 00:04:11	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-03-28 00:05:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that technique often makes your scene look more interesting because it dramatically varies the light

2016-03-28 00:05:35	Neocraftz1553	Leafy shadows
2016-03-28 00:05:41	ScruffyChat	Of course, you could model branches to cast shadows if you wanted; more accurate but takes more time
2016-03-28 00:05:50	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-28 00:06:18	Neocraftz1553	and a question...
2016-03-28 00:06:31	Neocraftz1553	how doI make accurat ish heat waves?
2016-03-28 00:06:43	ScruffyChat	heat waves? I've never tried that
2016-03-28 00:06:47	Neocraftz1553	with the refractive shader?
2016-03-28 00:07:04	Neocraftz1553	maybe use a wave texture for factor...
2016-03-28 00:07:07	Neocraftz1553	not sure...
2016-03-28 00:07:18	ScruffyChat	I would actually do that in a different application
2016-03-28 00:07:22	ScruffyChat	like an image editor
2016-03-28 00:07:23	Neocraftz1553	tried the above, but didn't look nice
2016-03-28 00:07:28	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-28 00:07:44	Neocraftz1553	now fire...
2016-03-28 00:07:45	ScruffyChat	Although I have no clue how to do that either
2016-03-28 00:07:51	Neocraftz1553	thats something else....
2016-03-28 00:07:55	ScruffyChat	With fire, I do smoke simulations
2016-03-28 00:08:04	ScruffyChat	But they require a *lot* of setup
2016-03-28 00:08:09	ScruffyChat	Or else nothing shows up
2016-03-28 00:08:13	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-03-28 00:08:19	Neocraftz1553	so very true
2016-03-28 00:08:26	ScruffyChat	And from my experience, they've worked better in Blender Internal than Cycles so far
2016-03-28 00:08:42	ScruffyChat	Cycles is in its adolescent stage with smoke and voxel data right now
2016-03-28 00:08:48	Neocraftz1553	thats cause its MADE for internal
2016-03-28 00:08:52	ScruffyChat	Right

2016-03-28 19:21:53	Neocraftz1553	not sure, yet
2016-03-28 19:21:56	Yoshi2	still to be determined
2016-03-28 19:21:58	Neocraftz1553	right now I'm just setting parameters
2016-03-28 19:22:00	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-28 19:22:08	Yoshi2	it's a classic user chat, if you are familiar with that idea
2016-03-28 19:22:23	Yoshi2	named after an user, and filled with people the user knows
2016-03-28 19:22:38	Neocraftz1553	I should put that in the Topic
2016-03-28 19:22:38	Neocraftz1553	yeah, mostly
2016-03-28 19:23:07	Neocraftz1553	I think I'll keep the Topic open, then I'll move it to PFE once I get it set up...
2016-03-28 19:23:25	Neocraftz1553	and then, not sure
2016-03-28 19:23:29	Marty2000	Lol, Testyo used a sentence I used like 3 days ago
2016-03-28 19:23:29	Testyo	but it does exactly the opposite of what the music track
2016-03-28 19:23:58	Marty2000	So he can reuse what we say...
2016-03-28 19:24:25	Marty2000	He just added bad language in it
2016-03-28 19:24:34	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-28 19:24:42	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm 2
2016-03-28 19:24:43	Testyo	I said is it meant using textures from the game, but ripped because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages is it meant to have any? and I've made one for the engine, using textures from the game, but ripped.
2016-03-28 19:25:01	Neocraftz1553	the engine...
2016-03-28 19:25:03	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-28 19:25:16	Neocraftz1553	nevermind
2016-03-28 19:25:31	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm 3
2016-03-28 19:25:31	Testyo	I said Third try : B evolves into bud and flower before A f***ing mess because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages Third try : B evolves into bud and flower before A (A evolves into flower at 2:20) and Basically, Pikmin Fanon's a f***ing mess. They were joined by the common word A.
2016-03-28 19:25:41	Yoshi2	I knew it sounded familiar
2016-03-28 19:26:34	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin Fanon is pretty good...
2016-03-28 19:26:54	Neocraftz1553	but it IS a f***ing mess
2016-03-28 19:27:17	Neocraftz1553	So many articles that need cleaning up...
2016-03-28 19:27:31	@Espyo	meh, not really a fan of those channels
2016-03-28 19:27:33	Neocraftz1553	So many pictures that aren't even about fanon games
2016-03-28 19:27:34	@Espyo	but thanks for the invite anyway
2016-03-28 19:27:39	Neocraftz1553	ok

2016-03-28 19:28:28	Neocraftz1553	I DID promise Pikfan to clean up some articles....
2016-03-28 19:29:23	Yoshi2	Espyo: do you know if Qt is supposed to have such terrible documentation?

2016-03-28 20:06:03	Jpmrocks	they only have like 6 pikmin models
2016-03-28 20:06:09	Neocraftz1553	(I used a sky for lighting, since its more accurate)
2016-03-28 20:06:35	Jpmrocks	oh sht wait
2016-03-28 20:06:40	Jpmrocks	they have awakening wood
2016-03-28 20:06:45	Jpmrocks	more like Awakening Good
2016-03-28 20:07:07	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-28 20:07:21	Neocraftz1553	they have beady long legs and raging long legs too
2016-03-28 20:08:03	Neocraftz1553	you want models? for pikmin?
2016-03-28 20:08:38	Neocraftz1553	hey Espyo, mind if I link him to your, uh, catalogue?
2016-03-28 20:09:05	@Espyo	oh, the Pikmin 3 ones?
2016-03-28 20:09:06	@Espyo	sure
2016-03-28 20:09:18	Jpmrocks	lol, are they textured?
2016-03-28 20:09:19	Neocraftz1553	https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5z619uid9ayzldx/AABaeQ7yqUqizWkKIdBCwntPa?dl=0#
2016-03-28 20:09:36	Yoshi2	but I think Jpmrocks wants the level geometry specifically
2016-03-28 20:09:49	Jpmrocks	one sec
2016-03-28 20:10:09	Jpmrocks	and textures too pls
2016-03-28 20:10:41	Neocraftz1553	they come with textures
2016-03-28 20:10:46	Jpmrocks	ah ok
2016-03-28 20:10:53	Neocraftz1553	what program do you use
2016-03-28 20:11:05	Neocraftz1553	blende?
2016-03-28 20:11:16	Neocraftz1553	blender
2016-03-28 20:11:19	Jpmrocks	i use maya, max, and Unreal
2016-03-28 20:12:09	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-28 20:12:23	Jpmrocks	what file type are they
2016-03-28 20:12:26	Neocraftz1553	I don't think you'll have a problem
2016-03-28 20:12:32	Neocraftz1553	.3ds
2016-03-28 20:13:22	Jpmrocks	ill have to see what maya can run
2016-03-28 20:16:06	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-28 20:25:35	Yoshi2	I might go back to wxpython in hopes that it has better documentation
2016-03-28 20:25:46	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/13/1459193093-tropical-forest-remix.png      Is it good enough to be added here : http://www.pikminwiki.com/Tropical_Forest_Remix

2016-03-28 20:27:14	Yoshi2	oh joy, google marked the wxpython site as possibly hacked
2016-03-28 20:27:26	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-28 20:27:47	@Espyo	but
2016-03-28 20:27:50	@Espyo	we already have a map
2016-03-28 20:27:59	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/4/48/Tropical_Forest_Remix.jpg
2016-03-28 20:28:28	Marty2000	Ah, I thought there was not because it wasn't on the article. Sorry ^^'
2016-03-28 20:28:39	@Espyo	but it is on the article
2016-03-28 20:28:41	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-28 20:28:55	@Espyo	on the infobox on the top-right, there's a button to open the map
2016-03-28 20:29:08	Marty2000	Ah!
2016-03-28 20:29:26	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-03-28 20:30:23	@Espyo	although I think there's a "rule" about putting maps on the gallery too
2016-03-28 20:30:35	@Espyo	because users that aren't running Javascript will not be able to see the map
2016-03-28 20:32:32	Yoshi2	hm, maybe I won't do wxpython because it hasn't seen an update in 2 years and doesn't officially support py3
2016-03-28 20:35:28	Marty2000	I was just looking for the maps for this article : http://www.pikminwiki.com/Nugget#Locations I didn't even notice the "map" button. The 5 articles about the 5 first levels are different too (no map button)
2016-03-28 20:36:35	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-28 20:36:36	@Espyo	weird
2016-03-28 20:36:41	@Espyo	speaking of those locations
2016-03-28 20:36:47	@Espyo	I don't think that's the best idea
2016-03-28 20:36:53	@Espyo	ideally, we'd explain where the nuggets are in text
2016-03-28 20:37:05	@Espyo	we can add images to complement, but circling them is a bit iffy
2016-03-28 20:37:13	Marty2000	Ok
2016-03-28 20:37:17	@Espyo	I'd prefer if we had a raw map of the stage without icons, and then somebody places the icons manually on top
2016-03-28 20:44:19	Jpmrocks	wait guys
2016-03-28 20:44:27	Jpmrocks	is there an ISO for the Pikmin 1 remake
2016-03-28 20:44:30	Jpmrocks	on Wii
2016-03-28 20:44:48	@Espyo	of course
2016-03-28 20:44:50	@Espyo	exactly the same files
2016-03-28 20:45:04	@Espyo	at least the same formats
2016-03-28 20:45:48	Jpmrocks	fug
2016-03-28 20:46:08	Jpmrocks	Jordan wants to know if there will be multiplayer for your engine
2016-03-28 20:47:05	@Espyo	there will
2016-03-28 20:47:08	@Espyo	where's my skype
2016-03-28 20:47:09	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-03-28 20:47:12	@Espyo	it didn't auto-start
2016-03-28 20:47:31	Jpmrocks	coolio
2016-03-28 20:48:12	@Espyo	there's like a MILLION unread messages
2016-03-28 20:48:19	@Espyo	and Luther is sending images in the bmp format
2016-03-28 20:48:21	@Espyo	whyyyyyyy
2016-03-28 20:48:33	@Espyo	AND TOMMY'S SENDING IN DDS FORMAT
2016-03-28 20:48:33	@Espyo	WHAT
2016-03-28 20:48:40	@Espyo	do I have to go in there and teach Pikipedia how image formats work
2016-03-28 20:50:08	Jpmrocks	no
2016-03-28 20:50:16	Jpmrocks	they were just sharing old files meme

2016-03-28 22:18:31	Marty2000	Yes
2016-03-28 22:19:44	Marty2000	The most illogical thing is that grounded Pikmin actually count as carriers even if they are in the air (because of the Winged Pikmin).
2016-03-28 22:19:58	Marty2000	And the carrying speed is even increased

2016-03-28 22:26:25	Marty2000	Hi
2016-03-28 22:32:55	@Espyo	okay, so for April Fool's, besides Pikmin Color Splash, we'll be doing an article for Pik-Min
2016-03-28 22:33:11	@Espyo	a live-action movie made by Nintendo whose plot is preeeeetty similar to Ant-Man
2016-03-28 22:33:41	@Espyo	as part of the collaborative Nintendo Cinematic Universe gag that some NIWA wikis will be doing
2016-03-28 22:33:53	Marty2000	Ha ha, cool
2016-03-28 22:34:01	@Espyo	I'm thinking if we should have some poster
2016-03-28 22:34:11	Scruffy	Nintendo Cinematic Universe, that's awesome
2016-03-28 22:34:23	@Espyo	http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/Ant-Man_%28film%29
2016-03-28 22:34:35	@Espyo	adding people in the background is simple
2016-03-28 22:34:41	@Espyo	just grab concept art, fade it a bit, done
2016-03-28 22:34:55	@Espyo	but Olimar in that bad-ass pose...
2016-03-28 22:35:00	@Espyo	that'll require some heavy-duty work from somebody
2016-03-28 22:35:04	@Espyo	who volunteers?
2016-03-28 22:35:17	Scruffy	I do!
2016-03-28 22:35:20	@Espyo	awesome
2016-03-28 22:35:31	Scruffy	So you just want a png of Olimar in that pose?
2016-03-28 22:35:34	@Espyo	we should brainstorm how Olimar should look like
2016-03-28 22:35:36	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-28 22:35:41	@Espyo	I'd say he should look like he always does
2016-03-28 22:35:53	@Espyo	but maybe some aesthetic features could be similar to the features Ant-Man has in that poster?
2016-03-28 22:36:01	@Espyo	color scheme is too far fetched
2016-03-28 22:36:16	Scruffy	I could edit his texture a little
2016-03-28 22:36:22	@Espyo	hm, the little cord connecting between his back and his helmet
2016-03-28 22:36:24	Scruffy	I think I would use a model I have at the moment
2016-03-28 22:36:34	Scruffy	And add toit
2016-03-28 22:36:35	@Espyo	I'm not so sure on the idea of making him look different
2016-03-28 22:36:44	@Espyo	I think the joke works better if it's subtle
2016-03-28 22:37:03	@Espyo	like "wow... this is a weird idea for a film. and it's so specific in some parts that I-- wait... THIS IS ANT-MAN"
2016-03-28 22:37:11	@Espyo	if we can get that reaction ^, I think we win
2016-03-28 22:37:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-28 22:37:54	@Espyo	I'll get started on the plot
2016-03-28 22:38:03	Scruffy	Okay, that'll give me some ideas
2016-03-28 22:38:06	@Espyo	time for me to google a lot of these terms and characters...
2016-03-28 22:38:09	Scruffy	I can only stay 10 more minutes
2016-03-28 22:38:12	Scruffy	Crunch time
2016-03-28 22:38:38	@Espyo	all right
2016-03-28 22:40:08	Scruffy	But tonight I'll start and hopefully finish work on it
2016-03-28 22:40:22	Scruffy	And give you some images
2016-03-28 22:40:28	Scruffy	How big do you want them?
2016-03-28 22:41:22	@Espyo	honestly, I can imagine the final poster being like 1024x512
2016-03-28 22:41:26	@Espyo	no need for anything bigger
2016-03-28 22:41:29	@Espyo	it's just a silly gag
2016-03-28 22:41:35	Scruffy	Cool
2016-03-28 22:41:45	Scruffy	1024 is the height?
2016-03-28 22:41:49	Scruffy	or the width?
2016-03-28 22:41:50	@Espyo	uh, yeah
2016-03-28 22:41:55	@Espyo	 512x1024 is the right way around
2016-03-28 22:42:02	@Espyo	so tall, slim
2016-03-28 22:42:08	Scruffy	Cool
2016-03-28 22:42:26	Scruffy	Blender can render an image of any size, so I can give you exactly that
2016-03-28 22:43:00	@Espyo	right
2016-03-28 22:43:07	Scruffy	Do you want how it is in the poster, with skrunken Olimar in front of larger Olimar?
2016-03-28 22:43:17	Scruffy	Or do you want his full body visible?
2016-03-28 22:43:22	@Espyo	wait what
2016-03-28 22:43:24	@Espyo	two Olimars?
2016-03-28 22:43:26	@Espyo	did I miss something?
2016-03-28 22:43:28	@Espyo	lemme take a closer look
2016-03-28 22:43:35	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-03-28 22:43:40	@Espyo	uhm
2016-03-28 22:43:43	Scruffy	The shrunken antman is on the marvel logo
2016-03-28 22:44:00	@Espyo	I guess, if you can do both, all the better
2016-03-28 22:44:11	@Espyo	hey, maybe you can make the images separate?

2016-03-28 22:45:23	@Espyo	the Nintendo logo, the other characters, etc., those are all made after
2016-03-28 22:45:27	@Espyo	not really models at all
2016-03-28 22:45:31	@Espyo	nothing else is 3D...
2016-03-28 22:45:33	@Espyo	I think that's all
2016-03-28 22:46:24	Scruffy	Alright
2016-03-28 22:46:49	Scruffy	Well I can start for a few minutes, if you have any notes to add about Olimar's look, I can stay for about 4 minutes
2016-03-28 22:46:59	Scruffy	Then just leave a message on my talk page
2016-03-28 22:47:12	@Espyo	all right
2016-03-28 22:48:48	Scruffy	Oh, also, P3 olimar or Smash Bros olimar?
2016-03-28 22:49:01	Scruffy	Smash Olimar has more inherent detail, but... it's not canon
2016-03-28 22:49:11	@Espyo	I don't think the movie would be very canon heh
2016-03-28 22:49:12	@Espyo	so Smash
2016-03-28 22:49:32	Scruffy	That makes it easier, ya
2016-03-28 22:49:35	Scruffy	y
2016-03-28 22:49:49	@Espyo	the plot of this movie is more than I bargained for :|

2016-03-29 18:59:01	Testyo	the guy moves the camera about, with Z and here I am, no homework to speak of, procrastinating like crazy
2016-03-29 18:59:23	Scruffy	Heh
2016-03-29 18:59:42	Scruffy	Espyo, I've made Louie in a movie poster pose as well
2016-03-29 18:59:47	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:HD_Louie.png
2016-03-29 18:59:54	@Espyo	I saw
2016-03-29 18:59:56	@Espyo	brilliant job!
2016-03-29 18:59:59	@Espyo	also hi everyone
2016-03-29 19:00:11	@Espyo	see, I was writing up the story for Pik-Min
2016-03-29 19:00:14	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-03-29 19:00:23	@Espyo	checking up between Ant-Man's plot and how to translate it to Pikmin
2016-03-29 19:00:29	@Espyo	and after several hours, I finally have the perfect plot
2016-03-29 19:00:33	@Espyo	then I looked at it
2016-03-29 19:00:45	@Espyo	"Wait... Louie is the main character in this one. Well, cool."
2016-03-29 19:00:56	@Espyo	"Wait... if Louie is the main character and not Olimar... SCRUFF-- oh dammit"
2016-03-29 19:01:10	Klemen702	gg
2016-03-29 19:01:20	@Espyo	buuuut it all worked out in the end
2016-03-29 19:01:34	@Espyo	anyway, here's some small news
2016-03-29 19:01:51	@Espyo	one of the driving forces behind this collab April Fool's joke died two days ago
2016-03-29 19:02:05	@Espyo	her last contribution to the community was the logo for Nintendo Cinematic Universe
2016-03-29 19:02:13	@Espyo	we have to honor her by doing a pretty good job out of this joke
2016-03-29 19:02:14	Scruffy	Oh no!
2016-03-29 19:02:21	@Espyo	and dammit, I think we're succeeding
2016-03-29 19:02:28	Klemen702	an actual death?
2016-03-29 19:02:31	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-29 19:02:46	@Espyo	apparently everybody is griefing
2016-03-29 19:02:48	@Espyo	she was loved by many
2016-03-29 19:02:52	@Espyo	a bureaucrat at Mario Wiki
2016-03-29 19:02:58	@Espyo	and like I said, one of the main forces of this event
2016-03-29 19:03:05	@Espyo	if not for the collab, I wouldn't even know of her death
2016-03-29 19:03:11	@Espyo	I'd just mind my own business at the wikis I frequent
2016-03-29 19:04:04	@Espyo	got real sad yesterday reading up on how everybody was upset about her dying
2016-03-29 19:04:06	@Espyo	I hate this
2016-03-29 19:04:06	Klemen702	welp
2016-03-29 19:05:23	Scruffy	Man, that's terrible
2016-03-29 19:05:32	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Dismiss by Marty (+194) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Dismiss&curid=9942&diff=161121&oldid=161120
2016-03-29 19:05:44	Klemen702	there is nothing to do for me other than say ''okay then'' (talking about that death)
2016-03-29 19:05:58	Klemen702	because not much really can be done other than caring and not caring
2016-03-29 19:06:06	@Espyo	I guess
2016-03-29 19:06:08	Yoshi2	it does suck
2016-03-29 19:06:11	@Espyo	nothing changes death, so
2016-03-29 19:06:25	@Espyo	but regardless, I'm determined to make her final wish come out great
2016-03-29 19:07:00	Klemen702	and that
2016-03-29 19:07:13	Klemen702	making her wishes that she coudn't do is also a thing
2016-03-29 19:07:22	Yoshi2	can't let the death affect you too much [negatively]
2016-03-29 19:08:02	Klemen702	when my grandpa died all i could really think of is ''oh no''
2016-03-29 19:08:32	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-29 19:08:37	@Espyo	"luckily", I didn't know her
2016-03-29 19:08:39	@Espyo	so it's only a bummer
2016-03-29 19:08:55	@Espyo	the reason I'm so determined is that since I'm already working on the joke, might as well give it my all
2016-03-29 19:09:56	@Espyo	oh, I finally understand Marty's lock-on glitch
2016-03-29 19:10:02	@Espyo	uh, does that only happen with Olimar?
2016-03-29 19:10:11	@Espyo	Pikmin 3's starting to become as janky as Pikmin 2, good grief
2016-03-29 19:11:31	Scruffy	Yeah, and in Pikmin 3 they stop moving for about 2 seconds to do it
2016-03-29 19:11:31	Marty2000	Hi
2016-03-29 19:11:40	Marty2000	And yes, it only happens with Olimar
2016-03-29 19:11:41	Scruffy	Which wastes a lot of time if you do it accidentally
2016-03-29 19:12:05	@Espyo	how so?
2016-03-29 19:12:40	Marty2000	I don't know how it happens, but it's easy to reproduce, nothing is required. It doesn't work with Louie
2016-03-29 19:13:31	Scruffy	I thought it does work with the Koppaites
2016-03-29 19:14:39	@Espyo	no, I mean I don't understand the "stop moving for about 2 seconds" bit
2016-03-29 19:17:03	Scruffy	Unlike in P1, you can't move while dismissing
2016-03-29 19:17:23	Scruffy	And they go through this whole jumping animation that lasts about 2 seconds
2016-03-29 19:17:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-29 19:17:55	@Espyo	but when did dismissing come into the conversation?
2016-03-29 19:19:48	Scruffy	Oops, I misread "lock-on" glitch because Marty had just edited the Dismiss page
2016-03-29 19:19:53	Scruffy	that's really disorienting now

2016-03-29 19:30:50	Scruffy	So what is the story for Pik-Min, if it can be spoiled?
2016-03-29 19:31:03	Yoshi2	top secret info
2016-03-29 19:32:36	@Espyo	it's the story for Ant-Man :|
2016-03-29 19:32:43	@Espyo	I can share it
2016-03-29 19:32:54	@Espyo	whomever wants to read it, feel free
2016-03-29 19:32:56	@Espyo	but it's a beta
2016-03-29 19:33:03	@Espyo	and it kinda spoils the joke
2016-03-29 19:33:15	@Espyo	but, since everybody here already knows what the joke is, that's less important
2016-03-29 19:33:46	@Espyo	https://www.dropbox.com/s/7y6bcl3307q5tvv/Pik-Min%20draft.txt?dl=0
2016-03-29 19:34:21	Klemen702	i won't read because i have no clue what ant-man is
2016-03-29 19:35:27	@Espyo	neither did I
2016-03-29 19:35:31	@Espyo	I think that's part of the fun
2016-03-29 19:35:40	@Espyo	you either read this and laugh because of the paralels
2016-03-29 19:35:45	@Espyo	or you read it and laugh because "what"
2016-03-29 19:36:00	Scruffy	Yeah, I haven't seen the movie but I can tell it would be based off of AntMan
2016-03-29 19:36:37	Scruffy	If you need any more help making the poster, just let me know
2016-03-29 19:37:22	Klemen702	actually
2016-03-29 19:37:31	Klemen702	nah nvm

2016-03-29 19:40:31	@Espyo	I'll try some GIMP magic on the poster
2016-03-29 19:40:35	@Espyo	and if I need help, I'll ask, thanks
2016-03-29 19:40:38	Scruffy	No prob
2016-03-29 19:41:03	@Espyo	hey, that doesn't look THAT bad
2016-03-29 19:41:08	Scruffy	Heh, Yoshi2 that reminds me of trying Portal 2 for the first time and a glitch causing all GUI to disappear except icons
2016-03-29 19:41:37	Scruffy	At first I thought the game was trying to be edgy, but I figured out it was just being difficult
2016-03-29 19:41:52	Yoshi2	Scruffy: thanks that my gui reminds you of a glitch that causes all gui except icons to disappear :-|
2016-03-29 19:42:42	Scruffy	No yours looks good so far
2016-03-29 19:43:19	Scruffy	Sorry, I picked up Portal 2 very recently

2016-03-29 19:44:59	Yoshi2	hi bulborbs
2016-03-29 19:45:32	Bulborbs_At_View	Hey
2016-03-29 19:45:54	Scruffy	Hi Bulborbs_At_View
2016-03-29 19:46:12	@Espyo	Portal 2's amazing
2016-03-29 19:46:13	Yoshi2	Scruffy: you do have permission to shit all over my gui, stuff like "oh why is there no About button?" or "wow the layout is all messed up"
2016-03-29 19:46:15	@Espyo	super fun with co-op
2016-03-29 19:48:34	Klemen702	hi BAV
2016-03-29 19:49:22	Scruffy	Yoshi2: as far as what you're going for, I feel it's pretty streamlined. What goes in the column next to the left of the copy and delete buttons?
2016-03-29 19:50:23	Scruffy	*to the left, not next to the left
2016-03-29 20:06:23	Klemen702	a bit late but
2016-03-29 20:06:30	Klemen702	so... speaking of other games
2016-03-29 20:06:35	Klemen702	what else do you guys like?
2016-03-29 20:07:16	@Espyo	I don't like fighting games that much
2016-03-29 20:07:19	@Espyo	and I'll pass on racing games
2016-03-29 20:07:24	@Espyo	so... everything else, I like
2016-03-29 20:07:29	@Espyo	too vague? :V
2016-03-29 20:07:58	Klemen702	eh
2016-03-29 20:08:05	Klemen702	i was thinking like
2016-03-29 20:08:13	Klemen702	''which do you like the most''
2016-03-29 20:08:24	Klemen702	name of the game/franchise is also fine
2016-03-29 20:09:08	@Espyo	I'm really loving Fire Emblem Awakening for the past year
2016-03-29 20:09:16	@Espyo	play it every day on the subway ride to and from work
2016-03-29 20:09:47	Klemen702	i haven't seen much of it
2016-03-29 20:09:50	Klemen702	what is it about?
2016-03-29 20:10:52	Yoshi2	Scruffy: the big square on the left will contain the map rendering, the tall square to the right will contain a list of units currently in the map
2016-03-29 20:14:21	@Espyo	in the Fire Emblem series, you have your units on a map, split in a grid, and you have the enemy's units
2016-03-29 20:14:24	@Espyo	like chess
2016-03-29 20:14:39	@Espyo	they're strategy games, so you have to carefully pick your actions and plan for the future
2016-03-29 20:15:04	Klemen702	seems interesting
2016-03-29 20:15:16	Klemen702	i would say ''i'l check it out later'' but i most likely woudn't
2016-03-29 20:15:17	@Espyo	sure, it's a good idea to let your archer attack that Pegasus rider since they're weak to arrows, but moving your archer in close leaves him defenseless from the nearby sword users, since archers can't attack at close distance
2016-03-29 20:15:23	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-29 20:15:36	@Espyo	I love Awakening in particular because of its charm and plot
2016-03-29 20:15:40	@Espyo	I bet the other games in the series have it too
2016-03-29 20:15:47	@Espyo	but Awakening seems to have so many things just done right
2016-03-29 20:15:59	@Espyo	it was my first game in the strategy genre, and I fell in love with it
2016-03-29 20:16:11	@Espyo	...and it's HARD
2016-03-29 20:16:18	@Espyo	I played on the easiest difficulty first, it was all right
2016-03-29 20:16:22	@Espyo	now I'm playing on the middle difficulty
2016-03-29 20:16:24	@Espyo	good grief
2016-03-29 20:16:27	@Espyo	you can plan for a million moves ahead
2016-03-29 20:16:42	@Espyo	and your best bet will still be to get that one unit surrounded by 4 enemy units and just somehow HOPE they won't die
2016-03-29 20:16:45	@Espyo	luck plays a factor
2016-03-29 20:17:02	@Espyo	in that depending on the weapons, unit types, terrain, etc., moves have a chance of failing
2016-03-29 20:18:04	Klemen702	that's alot of text
2016-03-29 20:18:08	Klemen702	seems like a  nice thin
2016-03-29 20:18:10	Klemen702	g
2016-03-29 20:21:01	Scruffy	Yoshi2: ah okay
2016-03-29 20:23:02	Scruffy	And I'm guessing you plan to have buttons for units you want to add, or for properties you want to change?
2016-03-29 20:23:19	Scruffy	Or would you type values like that in instead?
2016-03-29 20:24:46	Yoshi2	there will be something to change the properties, I'm not entirely sure how to implement that though
2016-03-29 20:24:52	@Espyo	huh?
2016-03-29 20:24:57	@Espyo	>Yellow Pikmin increases by 5 mice each time you enter into the water of the castle
2016-03-29 20:25:05	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWpBlOGjC_Q that's the description of this video
2016-03-29 20:25:06	Yoshi2	maybe an edit button will open a new window with all the attributes you can change
2016-03-29 20:25:17	@Espyo	what do you mean the number of Yellows increases by 5 every time you enter the Submerged Castle?
2016-03-29 20:25:21	@Espyo	at least, that's what I'm getting
2016-03-29 20:28:06	@Espyo	what
2016-03-29 20:28:07	@Espyo	it's true
2016-03-29 20:28:09	@Espyo	he goes in
2016-03-29 20:28:11	@Espyo	leaves
2016-03-29 20:28:15	@Espyo	and 5 Yellows are in the Onion
2016-03-29 20:28:26	@Espyo	how he can access the Yellow Onion before unlocking Yellows is beyond me, but
2016-03-29 20:28:55	Scruffy	i guess the Submerged Castle assumes the Yellow Onion is unlocked
2016-03-29 20:29:10	Scruffy	So after you enter it, the Yellow Onion loses its "independent" state
2016-03-29 20:32:02	@Espyo	is there something blocking the Yellow Onion?
2016-03-29 20:32:06	@Espyo	wait
2016-03-29 20:32:08	@Espyo	let me try that again
2016-03-29 20:32:14	@Espyo	is there something Yellow-related blocking the Submerged Castle?
2016-03-29 20:33:15	Scruffy	Well you need Yellow Pikmin to get Blue Pikmin
2016-03-29 20:34:35	@Espyo	...
2016-03-29 20:34:38	@Espyo	welp
2016-03-29 20:34:40	@Espyo	right are you
2016-03-29 20:34:42	@Espyo	...
2016-03-29 20:34:44	@Espyo	*right you are
2016-03-29 20:34:50	@Espyo	wow that was just too much stupid coming from my end at once
2016-03-29 20:35:59	Scruffy	hehe that's okay

2016-03-29 21:59:48	Marty2000	Did you know that flower Purple Pikmin are slower than leaf White Pikmin in Pikmin 2, but faster than them in Pikmin 3? It seems they nerfed the whites' speed.
2016-03-29 22:00:26	Klemen702	actually
2016-03-29 22:00:32	Klemen702	they could of made flower purple faster
2016-03-29 22:01:54	Marty2000	Yeah, they also slightly increased their speed... but you can clearly see the difference for leaf White Pikmin
2016-03-29 22:02:17	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-29 22:02:19	Marty2000	(when they are carrying something)
2016-03-29 22:02:33	Neocraftz1553	They nerfed purples and whites
2016-03-29 22:02:56	Neocraftz1553	whites don't do as much poison damage as they used to
2016-03-29 22:03:11	Neocraftz1553	and I'm not sure if purples still stun
2016-03-29 22:03:26	Klemen702	purples are only for carrying now
2016-03-29 22:03:29	Neocraftz1553	and they do less damage(or so I've heard)
2016-03-29 22:03:31	Marty2000	They completely nerfed whites, and they nerfed nearly everything that made purples great
2016-03-29 22:03:33	Marty2000	Only their speed was slightly increased
2016-03-29 22:03:47	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-03-29 22:03:49	Klemen702	i'm suprised there is even a buff
2016-03-29 22:04:47	Marty2000	Purples could inflict 20 points of damage in Pikmin 2, but they only do 15 in Pikmin 3
2016-03-29 22:04:55	Marty2000	(Same as Reds)
2016-03-29 22:05:19	Neocraftz1553	yeah, really nerfed...
2016-03-29 22:05:29	Neocraftz1553	Can they still stun?
2016-03-29 22:05:33	Marty2000	No
2016-03-29 22:06:10	Neocraftz1553	They reaaally nerfed them
2016-03-29 22:06:19	Marty2000	They can only crush enemies other Pikmin types can crush too (Dwarf Bulborbs, for example)
2016-03-29 22:06:27	Neocraftz1553	they took what made purples...
2016-03-29 22:06:34	Neocraftz1553	Purples...
2016-03-29 22:06:38	Marty2000	But it's even harder to crush with them
2016-03-29 22:06:59	Neocraftz1553	They don't home?
2016-03-29 22:07:12	Klemen702	they were nerfed so hard by those nerf guns that it made them weaker
2016-03-29 22:07:13	Neocraftz1553	They homed in P2
2016-03-29 22:07:16	Marty2000	They no longer home
2016-03-29 22:07:16	Klemen702	badjoke
2016-03-29 22:08:08	Marty2000	Even Whites saw their attack power decreased from 10 to 5 (same as winged Pikmin)
2016-03-29 22:08:24	Klemen702	what
2016-03-29 22:08:28	Klemen702	was that even neccesary
2016-03-29 22:08:41	Marty2000	For example...
2016-03-29 22:08:42	Neocraftz1553	wuuutt
2016-03-29 22:09:16	Marty2000	An egg can be broken in 3 hits with a Purple, 4 hits with a Red, and 5 hits with the rest in Pikmin 2

2016-03-29 22:10:55	Marty2000	Reds and Purples need 3 hits to break eggs, Yellows and Blues need 4, Winged and Whites need 7 if I recall well
2016-03-29 22:11:17	Klemen702	wow
2016-03-29 22:11:23	Marty2000	Wiat, it's 9 hits for the latter
2016-03-29 22:11:26	Marty2000	Wait*
2016-03-29 22:11:27	Neocraftz1553	woah
2016-03-29 22:12:00	Neocraftz1553	Why did they even nerf them?
2016-03-29 22:12:31	Klemen702	i think it's the egg health
2016-03-29 22:12:39	Marty2000	I don't know, it's useless since they are not in Story Mode or Battle Enemies
2016-03-29 22:12:39	Klemen702	otherwise they are supposed to be just good carriers...
2016-03-29 22:13:58	Marty2000	Fortunately, there is still the Ultra-spicy spray
2016-03-29 22:14:22	Marty2000	But once again, it can make Whites more powerful, but they will lose speed.
2016-03-29 22:14:33	Neocraftz1553	ye-

2016-03-29 22:39:01	@J	hey Espyo, what laptop did you get, and what do you think of it?
2016-03-29 22:39:23	@Espyo	random return
2016-03-29 22:39:27	@Espyo	a Lenovo Y700
2016-03-29 22:39:34	@Espyo	it's a pretty great laptop
2016-03-29 22:39:39	@Espyo	pretty much everything about it is flawless
2016-03-29 22:40:00	@Espyo	the CD drive is external, and the touchpad can get a tiny bit getting used to
2016-03-29 22:40:08	@Espyo	also battery seems pretty weird, but that might be too soon to say
2016-03-29 22:40:31	@Espyo	other than that, it's really nice
2016-03-29 22:40:35	@J	how's the keyboard?
2016-03-29 22:40:55	@Espyo	no complaints
2016-03-29 22:41:05	@Espyo	the keys are laid out in a logical way
2016-03-29 22:41:23	@Espyo	so no stupid Fn on the bottom-left corner *shiver*
2016-03-29 22:41:27	@J	I'll look at a photo for the layout, I mean more how they feel
2016-03-29 22:41:32	@Espyo	oh
2016-03-29 22:41:44	@Espyo	honestly, I don't have anything to say about how the keyboard feels
2016-03-29 22:41:47	@Espyo	which is a good thing
2016-03-29 22:42:05	@Espyo	I've had laptops where the keys went down slightly less than this
2016-03-29 22:42:12	@Espyo	but it's never noticeable or anything
2016-03-29 22:42:29	@J	also, are the tactile bits on F and J very noticeable (or whatever Portuguese equivalents are)?
2016-03-29 22:42:32	@Espyo	(also the keyboard can light up)
2016-03-29 22:42:37	@J	I like it when they're really easy to find
2016-03-29 22:42:41	@Espyo	they're still on F and J
2016-03-29 22:42:49	@Espyo	if you didn't mention them, I wouldn't have noticed them
2016-03-29 22:42:55	@Espyo	but if you're actually searching for them, yeah, they're right there
2016-03-29 22:43:16	@Espyo	I mean, if you have a general idea of where those keys are, you can pass your hand around them and feel them in a second
2016-03-29 22:43:44	@J	okay, I've just seen keyboards where they're barely there, and then they wear down quite quickly
2016-03-29 22:43:47	@Espyo	hm, the arrow keys have little bumps too
2016-03-29 22:43:49	@J	which is annoying
2016-03-29 22:43:53	@Espyo	wear down?
2016-03-29 22:43:54	@Espyo	woah
2016-03-29 22:44:17	@Espyo	honestly, they're pretty standard
2016-03-29 22:44:25	@Espyo	of the keyboard I remember touching that have them, they feel pretty much normal
2016-03-29 22:44:36	@Espyo	but of course, that was never really anything I cared about, so I can't really tell
2016-03-29 22:45:22	@J	it's really hard to tell from a photo too
2016-03-29 22:45:39	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-29 22:45:48	@J	for example, I know someone with a Das keyboard, and I don't like it, but I have a Filco and they're good
2016-03-29 22:45:57	@J	and looking at photos there's no difference
2016-03-29 22:46:07	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-29 22:46:15	@Espyo	they're pretty invisible to begin with
2016-03-29 22:46:24	@Espyo	looking at mine here, I can't see them
2016-03-29 22:46:39	@Espyo	and I have a light 2cm away from the keyboard
2016-03-29 22:46:39	Testyo	2 cm = 0.7876 in / 0.0656 ft / 1.05263 Olimar-heights
2016-03-29 22:49:18	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-29 22:49:22	@Espyo	I didn't imagine this one to be the hard part
2016-03-29 22:49:27	@Espyo	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/7/7d/Ant-Man_full-length_poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150506160810 I can't tell who's who
2016-03-29 22:49:32	@Espyo	I can tell the middle guy is Ant-Man (duh)
2016-03-29 22:49:36	@Espyo	but the rest of the people...
2016-03-29 22:49:38	@Espyo	not even with research
2016-03-29 22:49:45	@Espyo	the Wikipedia article has every character's actor
2016-03-29 22:49:51	@Espyo	but I can't understand who's who
2016-03-29 22:49:55	@Espyo	either I suck at faces, or...
2016-03-29 22:50:43	@J	I think I recognise 2 of the people
2016-03-29 22:51:07	@Espyo	you know their names?
2016-03-29 22:51:36	@Espyo	I'm looking for a Paul Rudd, a Corey Stoll, and a Michael Douglas
2016-03-29 22:51:57	@Espyo	...the only major woman in the film is Evangeline Lilly, so I can GUESS that that's the girl there
2016-03-29 22:51:59	@J	not their names, no
2016-03-29 22:52:07	@Espyo	but I can't really tell if she's her just by checking other images of her
2016-03-29 22:52:10	@Espyo	geez this is dumb
2016-03-29 22:54:48	@J	I guess from an image search, top-left is Michael Douglas
2016-03-29 22:54:53	@J	top-right is Paul Rudd
2016-03-29 22:55:01	@J	bottom-left is Corey Stoll
2016-03-29 22:55:09	@J	but they do all look quite different
2016-03-29 22:55:49	@Espyo	that looks like it adds up
2016-03-29 22:55:59	@Espyo	but darn, the guy on the top-right is the same guy in the Ant-Man outfit
2016-03-29 22:56:02	@Espyo	so he effectively appears twice
2016-03-29 22:56:06	@Espyo	that's gonna be a bit of a pain
2016-03-29 22:56:18	@Espyo	hang on, the guys on the skype group saw the movie
2016-03-29 22:59:02	@Espyo	wow everybody's saying something different
2016-03-29 22:59:14	@J	oh, apparently one of the thinkpad models claims 21h battery life
2016-03-29 22:59:16	@J	that's crazy
2016-03-29 22:59:38	@Espyo	I'm honestly not sure if mine's like that
2016-03-29 22:59:42	@Espyo	I remember something of the sort
2016-03-29 23:00:24	@Espyo	but see, yesterday and today I forgot to turn on the power socket before turning on the laptop
2016-03-29 23:00:33	@Espyo	and only realized like 15 minutes later
2016-03-29 23:00:38	@Espyo	and noticed the battery was at 85%
2016-03-29 23:00:43	@Espyo	same charge both days
2016-03-29 23:00:50	@Espyo	and in both days, it took like an hour to charge those 15%
2016-03-29 23:01:03	@Espyo	so either the boot-up sequence uses insane power
2016-03-29 23:01:06	@Espyo	or something's wrong
2016-03-29 23:01:11	@Espyo	or this isn't calibrated right
2016-03-29 23:05:24	@J	no, this is thinkpads, a different Lenovo range
2016-03-29 23:05:41	@Espyo	oh, mine's an Ideapad
2016-03-29 23:05:44	@J	Y700 is listed as 5h
2016-03-29 23:05:44	@Espyo	carry on
2016-03-29 23:05:47	@Espyo	and I've got all the characters
2016-03-29 23:05:52	@Espyo	yeeeeah, that seems more right
2016-03-29 23:06:04	@J	it's better than the 1h I get currently
2016-03-29 23:06:37	@Espyo	wow
2016-03-29 23:06:43	@J	I think batteries in general take much longer to charge the last few % than to charge to a relatively high %
2016-03-29 23:06:51	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-29 23:06:57	@Espyo	dunno, never quite had this problem with other laptops
2016-03-29 23:07:18	@J	yeah, I got this laptop 7 years ago, and I don't use it much, but I figured I could do with a new one
2016-03-29 23:07:26	@J	since I don't even have an HDD any more
2016-03-29 23:07:30	@J	few dead pixels
2016-03-29 23:07:34	@J	no battery life
2016-03-29 23:07:44	@J	worn keyboard
2016-03-29 23:08:53	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-03-29 23:08:58	@Espyo	remember though, it cost me 1000€
2016-03-29 23:08:58	Testyo	1000 € = £ 706.6  / $ 1087.2 
2016-03-29 23:10:48	@J	what options did you get?
2016-03-29 23:10:55	@J	looks like you can choose processor/graphics
2016-03-29 23:12:32	@Espyo	oh? I wasn't given any options
2016-03-29 23:12:32	@J	the price doesn't bother me that much since I generally don't buy much stuff
2016-03-29 23:12:40	@J	just looking at the website
2016-03-29 23:12:42	@Espyo	same here honestly
2016-03-29 23:12:51	@J	what make CPU and GPU did you get then?
2016-03-29 23:13:00	@Espyo	I got it from your every-day hardware stuff, so no choices
2016-03-29 23:13:14	@Espyo	Intel Core i7
2016-03-29 23:13:22	@Espyo	NVIDIA GeForce GTX
2016-03-29 23:13:28	@Espyo	uh... 9600 I think?
2016-03-29 23:14:31	@J	okay, looks like that actually costs £900 on the website
2016-03-29 23:14:32	Testyo	£ 900 = 1273.68 € / $ 1384.74 
2016-03-29 23:14:41	@Espyo	hmm
2016-03-29 23:14:45	@J	I guess it would be less from Amazon or something
2016-03-29 23:14:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-03-29 23:15:25	@J	no, £1000 there
2016-03-29 23:15:25	Testyo	£ 1000 = 1415.2 € / $ 1538.6 
2016-03-29 23:15:36	@J	meh, stuff always seems to cost more in the UK
2016-03-29 23:16:22	@Espyo	heh
2016-03-29 23:16:43	@Espyo	dunno, sometimes I see the same products being a lot cheaper over there than here
2016-03-29 23:16:53	@Espyo	can't really remember any examples, but uh, take my word for it, I guess

2016-03-30 00:01:51	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo...
2016-03-30 00:02:03	Neocraftz1553	what if I DO add in the breath clou?
2016-03-30 00:02:05	-->	RingtailedFox (FoxFoxFox@m57-80-1-20.home.cgocable.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-03-30 00:02:36	@Espyo	I'd accept the commit and implement it on the engine, with proper credit

2016-03-30 00:03:07	Neocraftz1553	really?
2016-03-30 00:03:17	Neocraftz1553	I might add in littke things like that...
2016-03-30 00:03:36	Neocraftz1553	not sure whats next, but maybe if I can somehow get it in
2016-03-30 00:03:45	@Espyo	sure, but it's no easy task
2016-03-30 00:03:48	Neocraftz1553	No pikmin breath clouds though
2016-03-30 00:03:54	@Espyo	setting up the project for itself is a bit of a pain
2016-03-30 00:03:55	Neocraftz1553	RIP framerate
2016-03-30 00:04:02	@Espyo	but then walking around my code could be a chore
2016-03-30 00:04:08	@Espyo	but don't let me stop you
2016-03-30 00:04:13	@Espyo	heck, quite the opposite
2016-03-30 00:04:14	Neocraftz1553	don't mind
2016-03-30 00:04:26	Neocraftz1553	I LOVE reading code
2016-03-30 00:04:28	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-03-30 00:04:36	Neocraftz1553	its pretty cool
2016-03-30 00:04:40	@Espyo	hehe
2016-03-30 00:04:48	@PikFan	Espyo: huh? http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Scruffy&curid=9710&diff=52038&oldid=51848
2016-03-30 00:04:48	@Espyo	let me know if you read it and have any doubt
2016-03-30 00:04:51	@Espyo	and I'll be able to answer
2016-03-30 00:05:02	@Espyo	what's up, you're not aware of the joke we're making yet?
2016-03-30 00:05:03	@PikFan	why do you need a movie-style Louie
2016-03-30 00:05:05	@PikFan	nope
2016-03-30 00:05:28	@Espyo	ok, so let me say it all real quick
2016-03-30 00:05:33	@PikFan	what, are they doing a...movie poster?
2016-03-30 00:05:36	@Espyo	the primary joke is Pikmin Color Splash
2016-03-30 00:05:47	Neocraftz1553	April Fool's 
2016-03-30 00:05:51	@Espyo	Nintendo announced a game to be released somewhere in 2016
2016-03-30 00:05:54	@Espyo	and it's just like Color Splash
2016-03-30 00:05:58	Neocraftz1553	mmmhm
2016-03-30 00:05:59	@Espyo	especially all of the controversies
2016-03-30 00:06:12	@Espyo	then, we got word that some NIWA wikis will be doing a collaboration joke
2016-03-30 00:06:22	@Espyo	in that the joke is all on the same topic, but each wiki has their own take on it
2016-03-30 00:06:25	@Espyo	we'll join in too
2016-03-30 00:06:30	@Espyo	the joke is Nintendo Cinematic Universe
2016-03-30 00:06:37	@Espyo	which is a parody of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
2016-03-30 00:06:46	@PikFan	right, right
2016-03-30 00:06:49	@Espyo	and Nintendo's making movies about different franchises
2016-03-30 00:07:05	@PikFan	oh neat
2016-03-30 00:07:08	@Espyo	and every movie is STRANGELY similar to existing Marvel movies (of the Marvel Cinematic Universe)
2016-03-30 00:07:12	@Espyo	ours will be Ant-Man
2016-03-30 00:07:16	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-30 00:07:18	@PikFan	how fitting
2016-03-30 00:07:26	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-30 00:07:28	@Espyo	I already made an article for its plot and am now working on making a cover
2016-03-30 00:07:38	@Espyo	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/7/7d/Ant-Man_full-length_poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150506160810 based on this
2016-03-30 00:07:44	@Espyo	that's where Scruffy comes in
2016-03-30 00:07:49	@PikFan	that reminds me of this http://img07.deviantart.net/02b7/i/2015/122/3/7/hyrule_avengers_by_ever_so_excited-d8rthyf.jpg
2016-03-30 00:07:50	@Espyo	in that I requested he'd make Olimar in that pose
2016-03-30 00:07:55	Neocraftz1553	The modeler
2016-03-30 00:08:08	@Espyo	but as I was writing the plot, I realized that it'd make more sense to switch some characters around
2016-03-30 00:08:12	@PikFan	I died when I discovered that
2016-03-30 00:08:13	@Espyo	so Louie is actually the main character
2016-03-30 00:08:20	@Espyo	soooooo, I asked him to redo the image
2016-03-30 00:08:28	@Espyo	oh wow that image heh
2016-03-30 00:08:34	Neocraftz1553	I saw both of em
2016-03-30 00:08:40	@Espyo	wow, every one of those faces work
2016-03-30 00:09:03	@PikFan	Tingle is priceless
2016-03-30 00:09:07	@Espyo	yep
2016-03-30 00:09:15	@Espyo	so, if you have any ideas, shoot them quickly
2016-03-30 00:09:25	@Espyo	we've got two days
2016-03-30 00:09:32	Neocraftz1553	forr....
2016-03-30 00:09:43	@Espyo	Thursday night, I'll be uploading the articles and changing the front page to put both jokes in
2016-03-30 00:09:54	@PikFan	I haven't seen Ant-Man yet, so I've got nothing :(
2016-03-30 00:09:55	@PikFan	sorry
2016-03-30 00:10:04	Neocraftz1553	Color Splash, or Nintendo Cinimatic Universe
2016-03-30 00:10:09	@PikFan	what are the other NIWA wikis doing?
2016-03-30 00:10:13	Neocraftz1553	Haven't seen it either...
2016-03-30 00:10:27	Neocraftz1553	Superman?
2016-03-30 00:10:32	@Espyo	neither have I, but I read the plot
2016-03-30 00:10:44	@Espyo	uh, not quite sure, but I know what wikis are participating
2016-03-30 00:10:45	@Espyo	uh, kinda
2016-03-30 00:10:50	@Espyo	well, don't even know off the top of my head
2016-03-30 00:10:50	Neocraftz1553	uh..............
2016-03-30 00:10:54	@Espyo	so I guess we'll wait and see
2016-03-30 00:11:01	Neocraftz1553	probably
2016-03-30 00:11:21	@PikFan	I guess we will
2016-03-30 00:11:27	Neocraftz1553	Damn VS

2016-03-30 00:11:41	Neocraftz1553	I wonder how the community will react
2016-03-30 00:11:45	@Espyo	until I got on windows, that was my daily prayer
2016-03-30 00:11:48	@Espyo	"damn VS"
2016-03-30 00:11:49	@Espyo	"amen"
2016-03-30 00:12:07	@Espyo	as long as they have a giggle, that's good
2016-03-30 00:12:15	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-30 00:12:15	Neocraftz1553	hahaha
2016-03-30 00:12:18	@Espyo	oh, let me just leave you with the article

2016-03-30 00:13:20	Neocraftz1553	let me try this...
2016-03-30 00:13:21	@Espyo	night
2016-03-30 00:13:24	@PikFan	Neocraftz1553: damn VS, back at it again with those...uh...dank memes?
2016-03-30 00:13:25	Neocraftz1553	\o yo
2016-03-30 00:13:27	Neocraftz1553	night
2016-03-30 00:13:27	@PikFan	night Espyo
2016-03-30 00:13:50	<--	Espyo (Espyo@y00-124-7-306.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-03-30 00:14:01	Scruffy	Wow
2016-03-30 00:14:04	Scruffy	Night Espyo!
2016-03-30 00:14:24	Scruffy	How did he drain the color from those? Was that a glitch?
2016-03-30 00:14:48	<--	Testyo (Testyo@y00-124-7-306.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-03-30 00:15:03	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-30 00:15:03	Neocraftz1553	You know what VS is?
2016-03-30 00:15:03	Neocraftz1553	Visual Studio
2016-03-30 00:15:09	Scruffy	Ah
2016-03-30 00:15:23	@PikFan	oh, so you edited it?
2016-03-30 00:18:46	Scruffy	Espyo's plot is really good
2016-03-30 00:19:03	Scruffy	and it's a good strategy of his to write down plot questions so he can later fill in holes
2016-03-30 00:21:16	Scruffy	Oh, PikFan, I've finished the Vehemoth Phosbat piano arrangement
2016-03-30 00:21:32	Scruffy	Now all that's left is to practice it enough to where I can record it in one take
2016-03-30 00:22:07	@PikFan	ooh, neato
2016-03-30 00:22:13	Neocraftz1553	Music
2016-03-30 00:22:27	Neocraftz1553	Oh, Scruffy, what do you think of...
2016-03-30 00:23:20	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 00:26:54	Neocraftz1553	hold up
2016-03-30 00:26:54	Neocraftz1553	doooooeeesss....
2016-03-30 00:26:54	Neocraftz1553	This work
2016-03-30 00:26:54	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:DiamondSpiderRender.png
2016-03-30 00:27:20	Scruffy	It does; that's really neat!
2016-03-30 00:27:21	@PikFan	oh, Scruffy, how do you feel about this particular...uh, work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4
2016-03-30 00:28:10	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2016-03-30 00:28:18	Scruffy	I think it's pretty brilliant toward the point John Cage was trying to make, what do you think?
2016-03-30 00:28:35	Neocraftz1553	Its a render of...
2016-03-30 00:28:57	@PikFan	I don't fully understand the meaning behind it, but I think it's pretty interesting that he chose not to do anything
2016-03-30 00:29:22	@PikFan	in a way, I think he's trying for us to listen to the music of life itself
2016-03-30 00:29:27	Scruffy	Exactly
2016-03-30 00:29:37	Scruffy	The quote at the beginning says everything we do is music
2016-03-30 00:30:02	Neocraftz1553	Does THIS work?
2016-03-30 00:30:02	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:DiamondSpider.png
2016-03-30 00:30:03	Scruffy	He wanted to put it in context of a concert so that we'd recognize the sounds we make (coughing, clearing our throats, even the sound of air) as music
2016-03-30 00:30:11	Neocraftz1553	Sorry, internets a bit wierd today
2016-03-30 00:30:11	Neocraftz1553	not sure if the links work or not
2016-03-30 00:30:22	@PikFan	ah
2016-03-30 00:30:24	Scruffy	That one didn't work, wasn't named correclty
2016-03-30 00:30:29	Scruffy	correctly*
2016-03-30 00:30:38	Scruffy	PikFan: at least, that's what I get out of it
2016-03-30 00:31:00	Scruffy	Silence is just as much music as sound
2016-03-30 00:31:17	@PikFan	well, what is sound, really? vibrations passing through the air
2016-03-30 00:31:21	@PikFan	or some other medium
2016-03-30 00:31:21	Scruffy	Music couldn't exist as it does without silence, or space
2016-03-30 00:31:44	@PikFan	so even if we don't "hear" anything, there's still sounds going on
2016-03-30 00:31:49	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-30 00:31:54	@PikFan	too tiny for us to hear
2016-03-30 00:32:08	Scruffy	There's plenty of music that we can't hear but that exists nonetheless
2016-03-30 00:32:26	@PikFan	I think it's amazing that the SUN can make music
2016-03-30 00:32:35	Scruffy	All the celestial bodies, yeah
2016-03-30 00:33:19	Scruffy	Another thing that's amazing about 4:33 is how even though nothing is happening, it still gets people to wait as quietly as they can
2016-03-30 00:33:56	Scruffy	Sure, there's an element of expectation nowadays, but because of that the music that comes out of the performance is different every time
2016-03-30 00:34:35	Neocraftz1553	wow
2016-03-30 00:34:42	Neocraftz1553	lots of text
2016-03-30 00:35:37	@PikFan	oh, you ain't seen nothing yet
2016-03-30 00:35:48	Neocraftz1553	If a tree falls in a forest and noones there to here it, does it make a sound?
2016-03-30 00:35:50	Neocraftz1553	no derr
2016-03-30 00:35:55	@PikFan	sometimes J and Espyo will go on long drawls about programming and such
2016-03-30 00:36:04	@PikFan	and most of it goes over my head
2016-03-30 00:36:27	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-30 00:36:35	Scruffy	I'm willing to discuss philosophy any time though
2016-03-30 00:36:55	@PikFan	ok
2016-03-30 00:36:56	Neocraftz1553	I know...
2016-03-30 00:37:01	@PikFan	what is the meaning of life?
2016-03-30 00:37:05	@PikFan	nah
2016-03-30 00:37:08	@PikFan	:P
2016-03-30 00:37:12	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-03-30 00:37:17	Neocraftz1553	Its epic at times
2016-03-30 00:37:17	Neocraftz1553	 42
2016-03-30 00:37:17	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-30 00:37:43	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Diamondspider.png
2016-03-30 00:37:45	Neocraftz1553	there
2016-03-30 00:37:53	Neocraftz1553	it SHOULD work
2016-03-30 00:37:59	Scruffy	Yeah, it does
2016-03-30 00:38:04	Scruffy	DId you make that in BLendeR/
2016-03-30 00:38:10	Scruffy	Did you make that in Blender?
2016-03-30 00:38:17	Neocraftz1553	It did come out somewhat like it
2016-03-30 00:38:37	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-30 00:38:47	Neocraftz1553	Cycles
2016-03-30 00:38:49	Neocraftz1553	 1000 Samples
2016-03-30 00:39:01	Neocraftz1553	anything less made it look noisy
2016-03-30 00:39:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-30 00:39:47	Scruffy	I just realized something creepy about the character design of Sonic the Hedgehog
2016-03-30 00:40:49	Neocraftz1553	Used the Pro Lighting Skies demo, btw
2016-03-30 00:40:59	Scruffy	Ah
2016-03-30 00:41:08	Neocraftz1553	it lets you make the background transparent
2016-03-30 00:41:09	Neocraftz1553	The only problem is that it gives glossy stuff something to reflect
2016-03-30 00:41:09	Neocraftz1553	I mean, thats okay and all, but...
2016-03-30 00:41:09	Neocraftz1553	You can see some clouds on its joints if you look closely 
2016-03-30 00:41:30	Scruffy	I think it's fine
2016-03-30 00:41:57	Scruffy	And if you change the roughness of the glossy materials, they don't perfectly reflect anymore
2016-03-30 00:42:53	Scruffy	But look up a picture of Sonic the Hedgehog
2016-03-30 00:43:03	Scruffy	This is kind of easier to envision than to actually see
2016-03-30 00:43:15	Scruffy	But his eyes are connected right above the snout
2016-03-30 00:43:25	Scruffy	Meaning he just has one giant eye with two pupils
2016-03-30 00:43:32	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-03-30 00:43:47	@PikFan	that's in a lot of cartoony characters
2016-03-30 00:44:03	@PikFan	like the cars from Cars
2016-03-30 00:44:45	Scruffy	There it's more understandable, their eyes are windshields and those normally aren't separated into two parts

2016-03-30 01:15:05	@PikFan	hey, Scruffy
2016-03-30 01:15:13	@PikFan	I need your help real quick
2016-03-30 01:15:52	Scruffy	Sure
2016-03-30 01:15:58	@PikFan	ok, so
2016-03-30 01:16:19	@PikFan	you remember Chapter 5 from my story, yes? the one with the battle of the three Snagrets?
2016-03-30 01:16:24	Scruffy	yes
2016-03-30 01:16:28	@PikFan	okay
2016-03-30 01:16:50	@PikFan	I'm not sure how to make the main characters react to the battle
2016-03-30 01:17:02	@PikFan	obviously, it was awful and horrible
2016-03-30 01:17:16	@PikFan	...but I don't know how to make them show their emotions
2016-03-30 01:17:52	@PikFan	should I portray them as resilient and brave? or scared and fearful?
2016-03-30 01:18:04	Scruffy	It depends on their level of experience
2016-03-30 01:18:21	Scruffy	The Pikmin new to battles should be scared, or even resigned
2016-03-30 01:18:47	Scruffy	But the more seasoned Pikmin help them out and get very brave, they become role model figures
2016-03-30 01:19:01	Scruffy	you could even have the oldest characters feeling nostalgia about battling
2016-03-30 01:19:02	@PikFan	right
2016-03-30 01:19:22	@PikFan	see, the thing is I want to make the older Pikmin feel fear too
2016-03-30 01:19:45	Scruffy	I feel the battle went well enough that they didn't have to feel fear
2016-03-30 01:19:54	Scruffy	Maybe a little regret for losing Pikmin
2016-03-30 01:19:54	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-30 01:20:03	Scruffy	But I didn't feel like the Pikmin were on the losing side
2016-03-30 01:20:20	@PikFan	yeah, I see where you're coming from
2016-03-30 01:20:26	Scruffy	They'd feel fear if it caught them off-guard
2016-03-30 01:20:35	Scruffy	Like the Waterwraith does
2016-03-30 01:20:44	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-30 01:20:44	Scruffy	Or the Beady Long Legs
2016-03-30 01:21:01	@PikFan	well, it's just that none of them had ever seen the Tree Snagret before

2016-03-30 01:21:16	Scruffy	Everyone I've seen who tries Pikmin 2 freaks out at the Beady Long Legs because it's bigger than any previous enemy
2016-03-30 01:21:44	@PikFan	being twice the size of a Pileated Snagret, I was intending for it to intimidate even the veterans, but...
2016-03-30 01:21:51	@PikFan	I guess my writing got away from me
2016-03-30 01:21:53	Scruffy	Perhaps none of them had seen the Tree Snagret, but it didn't surprise them; they knew it was there already
2016-03-30 01:22:09	Scruffy	And, it being a Snagret, they had an idea of how to fight it
2016-03-30 01:22:23	Scruffy	They had a strong sense of hope going into the battle
2016-03-30 01:22:29	Scruffy	And that's difficult to turn into fear
2016-03-30 01:22:38	@PikFan	hm, true
2016-03-30 01:22:52	Scruffy	I think this should be all around a victory, and the Pikmin soon get their bearings
2016-03-30 01:23:07	Scruffy	But then hit them with other trials later on that not only test them but surprise them
2016-03-30 01:23:37	@PikFan	yeah
2016-03-30 01:23:40	Scruffy	Put them in a situation where they don't know what to do or have little control over what happens
2016-03-30 01:23:44	@PikFan	hey, /surprise/
2016-03-30 01:23:46	@PikFan	yeah
2016-03-30 01:23:54	@PikFan	the surprise attack on the Onions
2016-03-30 01:24:02	Scruffy	Sure!
2016-03-30 01:24:16	Scruffy	By something they haven't encountered before
2016-03-30 01:24:30	Scruffy	A really good inspiration for fear across characters is kidnapping
2016-03-30 01:24:38	@PikFan	ooh
2016-03-30 01:24:44	Scruffy	Having Pikmin snatched without knowing what's capturing them or where they're going
2016-03-30 01:24:57	@PikFan	what about separation?
2016-03-30 01:25:19	@PikFan	say that in the confusion, the Onions try to takeoff, but because they're all damaged, they all crash
2016-03-30 01:25:24	@PikFan	but in various locations
2016-03-30 01:25:49	Scruffy	That could work, but then the audience would be curious about all of them, so you'd have to have separate chapters for all of them
2016-03-30 01:25:59	Scruffy	Unless you want to focus on just one
2016-03-30 01:26:03	Scruffy	That could work too
2016-03-30 01:26:12	@PikFan	I don't mind writing about all of them
2016-03-30 01:26:19	@PikFan	it would be an interesting narrative

2016-03-30 01:26:41	Scruffy	Well... since you're trying to stay in the thoughts of Ignis, you probably shouldn't reveal /too/ much that he doesn't see
2016-03-30 01:26:50	@PikFan	that's true
2016-03-30 01:26:53	Scruffy	Unless you're going omniscient
2016-03-30 01:27:06	@PikFan	there's this one story that shifts between first person and third person
2016-03-30 01:29:24	@PikFan	but anyway, back to the aftermath part
2016-03-30 01:29:38	@PikFan	I especially want to do something with Ignis, but again, I don't know what
2016-03-30 01:29:46	Neocraftz1553	A bulborb that roams around the whole map....
2016-03-30 01:29:49	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 01:30:03	@PikFan	if I make him cry, or something, that would contradict his earlier bravery
2016-03-30 01:30:13	Neocraftz1553	HMmmm....
2016-03-30 01:30:15	Neocraftz1553	make him...
2016-03-30 01:30:15	Scruffy	Well he's new, but he also pulled off that stunning fire move
2016-03-30 01:30:25	Scruffy	He should feel dazed
2016-03-30 01:30:30	@PikFan	at the same time though, if I continued that bravado, it wouldn't really make sense, because he's new
2016-03-30 01:30:33	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2016-03-30 01:30:48	Neocraftz1553	Tired, maybe
2016-03-30 01:31:04	@PikFan	OH, THAT'S PERFECT
2016-03-30 01:31:06	@PikFan	HE FAINTS

2016-03-30 01:31:13	Scruffy	Oh yeah!
2016-03-30 01:31:26	Scruffy	When he comes to everyone is just concerned for him
2016-03-30 01:31:45	@PikFan	ok, I really like this now
2016-03-30 01:32:23	@PikFan	because Ruby gives a speech, and introduces the Wingeds to the Reds
2016-03-30 01:32:33	@PikFan	then tells them about Ignis
2016-03-30 01:32:40	@PikFan	and while he's up there, he could faint
2016-03-30 01:32:55	@PikFan	ohhhh, this is even better
2016-03-30 01:33:27	@PikFan	when he wakes up, Ruby can finish her story about the other Sproutling that used Elem but sacrificed himself
2016-03-30 01:33:36	@PikFan	I really like this
2016-03-30 01:33:40	@PikFan	I really really like this
2016-03-30 01:34:49	@PikFan	what do you guys think?
2016-03-30 01:35:11	Scruffy	Yeah, that's great!
2016-03-30 01:35:14	Scruffy	Builds tension
2016-03-30 01:35:32	Scruffy	Makes Ignis grow up a little and get a little more cautious with his powers
2016-03-30 01:35:43	Scruffy	Reminds me of Avatar: The Last Airbender
2016-03-30 01:35:44	@PikFan	in shows, lots of people faint or whatever when they use a huge attack like that
2016-03-30 01:35:46	@PikFan	right, right

2016-03-30 01:47:55	@PikFan	heh

2016-03-30 01:48:54	Neocraftz1553	true, but I think the Emporer Bulblax is scarier
2016-03-30 01:49:00	Scruffy	Waterwraith was the scariest for me
2016-03-30 01:49:25	@PikFan	heh, I can see why
2016-03-30 01:49:33	Scruffy	By the time of the Plasm Wraith, I had grown as a musician and no longer found the music scary, just cool
2016-03-30 01:49:51	Neocraftz1553	its way bigger

2016-03-30 02:00:14	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-30 02:00:25	Neocraftz1553	Its a program online that lets you make....
2016-03-30 02:00:30	Neocraftz1553	music
2016-03-30 02:00:58	Scruffy	Hmm, neat!
2016-03-30 02:01:18	Neocraftz1553	We use it in Music class, its not so bad
2016-03-30 02:01:25	Neocraftz1553	its free
2016-03-30 02:02:52	Scruffy	Cool
2016-03-30 02:02:56	Scruffy	I'll have to try it out
2016-03-30 02:03:06	Scruffy	What sort of music class is it? What are you learning?
2016-03-30 02:03:16	Neocraftz1553	hmm....
2016-03-30 02:03:22	Neocraftz1553	Understanding music for now
2016-03-30 02:03:57	Neocraftz1553	we only have them on Tuesdays and Thursdays, though, and the other Students aren't really cooperative....
2016-03-30 02:04:15	Neocraftz1553	I mean, we had banging on buckets before this, aaaand...
2016-03-30 02:04:32	Neocraftz1553	long story short, the buckets were quite literally reduced to rubble
2016-03-30 02:04:56	Neocraftz1553	The buckets were to see if the Students were responsible enough to use the drums...
2016-03-30 02:05:17	Neocraftz1553	quite frankly, I think not...
2016-03-30 02:06:17	Scruffy	What sort of drums? I mean, were you banging on buckets with your hands?
2016-03-30 02:06:24	Scruffy	or with mallets or something
2016-03-30 02:06:59	Neocraftz1553	heh, mallets...
2016-03-30 02:07:21	Neocraftz1553	nah, we used the cheapest thing available...
2016-03-30 02:07:25	Neocraftz1553	Lowes Buckets with pipes as sticks
2016-03-30 02:07:40	Scruffy	Pipes!?
2016-03-30 02:07:51	Neocraftz1553	I mean, how the hell do you "accidentally" break a bucket like that
2016-03-30 02:07:54	Neocraftz1553	yes, pipes
2016-03-30 02:08:01	Neocraftz1553	no, not big pipes
2016-03-30 02:08:01	Scruffy	That's crazy
2016-03-30 02:08:13	Scruffy	I mean I understand that
2016-03-30 02:08:19	Scruffy	But destroying buckets like that
2016-03-30 02:08:57	Neocraftz1553	again, testing purposes
2016-03-30 02:08:59	Neocraftz1553	Plastic pipes, not metal pipes
2016-03-30 02:08:59	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 02:08:59	Neocraftz1553	yes, really crazy
2016-03-30 02:09:01	Neocraftz1553	Like, wtf crazy
2016-03-30 02:09:17	Neocraftz1553	the class before us destroyed half of the buckets...
2016-03-30 02:09:36	Neocraftz1553	like, the top halfs of them were torn/worn down...
2016-03-30 02:10:00	Scruffy	Yeah, that's not a good way to judge if people are ready for drums
2016-03-30 02:10:14	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-30 02:10:26	Scruffy	What kind of drums were they worried about?
2016-03-30 02:10:41	Neocraftz1553	but if thats what they did to the buckets, imagine expensive drums...
2016-03-30 02:10:43	Neocraftz1553	not sure
2016-03-30 02:10:46	Neocraftz1553	not even sure
2016-03-30 02:11:04	Neocraftz1553	probably snare...
2016-03-30 02:11:15	Neocraftz1553	no idea how much those cost though
2016-03-30 02:11:52	Neocraftz1553	then some people complained they'd rather play the flute, so I think the music teacher said, "Fuck it, lets do it online."
2016-03-30 02:12:05	Scruffy	Well if they were the cheapest buckets, I'd expect they'd break easily because they're not meant to be beaten
2016-03-30 02:12:07	Neocraftz1553	Brb, gtg eat
2016-03-30 02:12:21	Neocraftz1553	nah, they were pretty hardy
2016-03-30 02:12:24	Scruffy	But snare drums are, and they're resilient, and you don't beat them with pipes
2016-03-30 02:12:45	Scruffy	It's hard to break a snare drum with sticks unless you puncture it
2016-03-30 02:12:59	Scruffy	It's hard to break a djembe with your hand, period
2016-03-30 02:17:06	Neocraftz1553	hehehe....
2016-03-30 02:17:06	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-03-30 02:17:07	Neocraftz1553	eat
2016-03-30 02:17:07	Neocraftz1553	.
2016-03-30 02:17:07	Neocraftz1553	mmm...
2016-03-30 02:17:07	Neocraftz1553	food
2016-03-30 02:17:07	Neocraftz1553	Anyways...
2016-03-30 02:17:08	Neocraftz1553	Do you take singing?
2016-03-30 02:17:21	Scruffy	I used to
2016-03-30 02:17:22	Neocraftz1553	what kinda music do you take?
2016-03-30 02:17:33	Scruffy	So far or just right now?
2016-03-30 02:17:42	Neocraftz1553	They say they need more males in singing
2016-03-30 02:17:46	Neocraftz1553	right now
2016-03-30 02:18:33	Scruffy	Let's see
2016-03-30 02:20:20	Scruffy	I'm in an independent research class for composition, I'm in a jazz combo, I'm taking private piano lessons, and I'm in a Latin American ensemble class
2016-03-30 02:20:29	Scruffy	I'm also working on a composition project on the side
2016-03-30 02:20:56	Scruffy	And otherwise... I see a lot of my colleagues while playing gigs at our local restaurants
2016-03-30 02:24:59	Neocraftz1553	Ah, so you're an aspiring musician 
2016-03-30 02:25:12	Neocraftz1553	You love music, don't you?
2016-03-30 02:25:25	Neocraftz1553	thats a nice talent, to make music
2016-03-30 02:25:53	Scruffy	I do love music
2016-03-30 02:25:58	Scruffy	It's my passion, I'd say
2016-03-30 02:26:10	Scruffy	I'd like to go on to score for film and perhaps for video games
2016-03-30 02:26:21	Scruffy	And to compose in general
2016-03-30 02:26:28	Neocraftz1553	nice
2016-03-30 02:26:45	Neocraftz1553	Get into Nintendo and learn their secrets
2016-03-30 02:26:48	Neocraftz1553	:=-O 
2016-03-30 02:26:57	Neocraftz1553	whoops wrong smily
2016-03-30 02:27:01	Neocraftz1553	:P
2016-03-30 02:27:31	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-03-30 02:27:52	Neocraftz1553	I'd love to be a video gams developer
2016-03-30 02:27:59	Neocraftz1553	*game
2016-03-30 02:28:47	Scruffy	yeah
2016-03-30 02:28:50	Scruffy	It's tricky though
2016-03-30 02:29:18	Scruffy	I'd be in the design team, probably not the technical sie
2016-03-30 02:29:20	Scruffy	side*
2016-03-30 02:29:26	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I do have some experience, though....
2016-03-30 02:29:26	Neocraftz1553	mostly Unreal and Unity...
2016-03-30 02:29:28	Neocraftz1553	but some from scratch
2016-03-30 02:30:20	Neocraftz1553	Dammit, Keyboard 
2016-03-30 02:30:24	Neocraftz1553	doesn't want to work at times
2016-03-30 02:30:42	Neocraftz1553	probably you'll fit into Audi/Musical
2016-03-30 02:31:10	Neocraftz1553	Something like that
2016-03-30 02:31:19	Neocraftz1553	I'd love to design a simple game sometime...
2016-03-30 02:32:09	Neocraftz1553	it'll probably be something like life of a Spider, or something....
2016-03-30 02:32:09	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 02:32:10	Neocraftz1553	HMM...

2016-03-30 02:32:10	Neocraftz1553	something like Spore on Steriods...
2016-03-30 02:32:34	Neocraftz1553	a game where you explore an infinite universe
2016-03-30 02:32:49	Scruffy	Umm

2016-03-30 02:34:24	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-03-30 02:34:26	Neocraftz1553	It is so awsome...
2016-03-30 02:34:50	Neocraftz1553	but I can't help but wonder, they WILL run out of stuff someday
2016-03-30 02:35:09	Scruffy	not anytime soon though
2016-03-30 02:35:11	Neocraftz1553	Animals, Plants
2016-03-30 02:35:27	Neocraftz1553	I wonder...
2016-03-30 02:35:28	Neocraftz1553	nah

2016-03-30 02:36:52	Scruffy	Look up reference photos for it, that's what I did
2016-03-30 02:37:12	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-30 02:37:23	Neocraftz1553	after tha?

2016-03-30 02:38:55	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-03-30 02:41:41	Neocraftz1553	you're welcome
2016-03-30 02:41:42	Neocraftz1553	The first time I saw it, I was like "Is that a game?"
2016-03-30 02:41:42	Neocraftz1553	and of course, it was
2016-03-30 02:41:42	Neocraftz1553	but, WOW it was awsome
2016-03-30 02:41:42	Neocraftz1553	and still is
2016-03-30 02:41:42	Neocraftz1553	 Inspirational, you might say
2016-03-30 02:42:09	Neocraftz1553	uh, mind if I model my ship kinda like it though?
2016-03-30 02:42:19	Neocraftz1553	I kinda need it to have an observatory
2016-03-30 02:43:30	Scruffy	No problem! I'm honored to provide some inspiration
2016-03-30 02:43:49	Scruffy	As for me, could you help me create a new kart idea for the Pikmin video?
2016-03-30 02:43:59	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok
2016-03-30 02:44:03	Scruffy	I've recently made one based on the Nova Blaster from P1
2016-03-30 02:44:11	Neocraftz1553	which kinds do you have so far
2016-03-30 02:44:20	Neocraftz1553	I can model it, if you want
2016-03-30 02:44:39	Neocraftz1553	oh, and list the objects they were made after
2016-03-30 02:44:43	Scruffy	That's okay, I already have some prefabricated wheels to use
2016-03-30 02:45:28	Scruffy	There's the Common Go-cap (bike, Common Glowcap)
2016-03-30 02:45:35	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-03-30 02:45:58	Scruffy	The Crystal Wheel (three-wheeled, large crystal and crystal nodule)
2016-03-30 02:46:09	Scruffy	The Doodlebuggy (kart, Doodlebug)
2016-03-30 02:46:18	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-03-30 02:46:19	Scruffy	The Drake Rover (kart, S.S. Drake)
2016-03-30 02:46:35	Scruffy	The Hocotate Special (bike, Hocotate ship)

2016-03-30 02:48:12	Scruffy	oh, the course will be the Formidable Oak
2016-03-30 02:48:13	Neocraftz1553	Waterwraith, two wheeled
2016-03-30 02:48:23	Scruffy	And... I already have a golden vehicle
2016-03-30 02:48:29	Scruffy	Oh that one is great
2016-03-30 02:48:39	Neocraftz1553	aaand

2016-03-30 02:49:00	Scruffy	Nice
2016-03-30 02:49:09	Neocraftz1553	I think the Bulborb will fit into a kart more, though
2016-03-30 02:49:13	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-30 02:49:14	Neocraftz1553	like a dune buggy
2016-03-30 02:49:25	Neocraftz1553	the snout could be the hood of the kart
2016-03-30 02:49:36	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-30 02:49:43	Scruffy	Alright, I'll get started
2016-03-30 02:49:44	Scruffy	!
2016-03-30 02:50:17	Scruffy	Once I get 12 I'll be good to go
2016-03-30 02:50:38	Neocraftz1553	sooo
2016-03-30 02:50:47	Neocraftz1553	with those two you have 9
2016-03-30 02:50:57	Neocraftz1553	I have three more, I guess
2016-03-30 02:51:23	Neocraftz1553	The Secret Safe, Kart
2016-03-30 02:51:40	Scruffy	heh
2016-03-30 02:51:49	Scruffy	I planned one that's a big Pikpik carrot
2016-03-30 02:51:52	Neocraftz1553	Onio(P3) kart
2016-03-30 02:52:02	Neocraftz1553	the Onion one...
2016-03-30 02:52:16	Neocraftz1553	could be tthe last one to be unlocked, I guess
2016-03-30 02:52:43	Neocraftz1553	and the Onion is empty inside, so the riders ride inside a four wheeled, glass sphere
2016-03-30 02:52:49	Neocraftz1553	or a three wheeled, idk
2016-03-30 02:53:02	Neocraftz1553	It would look pretty cool, BUT...
2016-03-30 02:53:13	Scruffy	I feel there'd be more karts, there are only 12 shown in the video
2016-03-30 02:53:25	Neocraftz1553	getting cycles to understand light can go through glass...
2016-03-30 02:53:51	Neocraftz1553	maybe take the top off it, leave the onion like a fishbowl...
2016-03-30 02:54:14	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 02:54:31	Neocraftz1553	how many videos do you plan on makin?
2016-03-30 02:54:47	Neocraftz1553	making?
2016-03-30 02:55:06	Neocraftz1553	Oh, hey
2016-03-30 02:55:10	Neocraftz1553	oh, wait
2016-03-30 02:55:14	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 02:55:15	Scruffy	More than one, I'd say
2016-03-30 02:55:33	Neocraftz1553	did you usd a light inside the KHA ship?
2016-03-30 02:55:44	Neocraftz1553	to light the inside
2016-03-30 02:56:24	Scruffy	Yes
2016-03-30 02:56:28	Scruffy	It was Blender Internal
2016-03-30 02:56:41	Scruffy	Before I figured out how to use Cycles
2016-03-30 02:56:50	Neocraftz1553	ooooh
2016-03-30 02:57:07	Neocraftz1553	what looks better, blender internal...
2016-03-30 02:57:11	Neocraftz1553	or Cycles
2016-03-30 02:57:41	Scruffy	Cycles
2016-03-30 02:57:46	Scruffy	To me
2016-03-30 02:58:00	Scruffy	You have to tell Blender Internal to raytrace, and it doesn't want to 
2016-03-30 02:58:09	Neocraftz1553	me too, but...
2016-03-30 02:58:22	Neocraftz1553	lately, cycles has been looking bad....
2016-03-30 02:58:25	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 02:58:28	Scruffy	But with Cycles, it does it automatically, and with Open Shading Language you can go a lot farther with it
2016-03-30 02:58:51	Neocraftz1553	They don't look at all like... a game
2016-03-30 02:59:06	Neocraftz1553	look at my Tropical wilds render, for example...
2016-03-30 03:00:41	Scruffy	It's initially meant for photorealism
2016-03-30 03:01:05	Scruffy	But again, with OSL you can do a lot more than that (although I have no idea how to write shaders)
2016-03-30 03:01:52	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 03:02:14	Neocraftz1553	how do I make them more like the Pikmin Forever Cycle?
2016-03-30 03:02:20	Neocraftz1553	I have no idea...
2016-03-30 03:04:03	Neocraftz1553	Almost done with the Roof of the ship
2016-03-30 03:04:10	Neocraftz1553	the hard part is frameing it
2016-03-30 03:04:22	Scruffy	Pikmin Forever Cycle?
2016-03-30 03:06:42	Neocraftz1553	Orange Bulborb
2016-03-30 03:06:45	Neocraftz1553	Olomar
2016-03-30 03:06:49	Neocraftz1553	Yellow Pikmin
2016-03-30 03:06:53	Neocraftz1553	Olimar
2016-03-30 03:07:02	Neocraftz1553	Neat Grass meshes
2016-03-30 03:07:09	Neocraftz1553	Sent it to me
2016-03-30 03:07:11	Neocraftz1553	there
2016-03-30 03:07:59	Neocraftz1553	hey, I wouldn't mind if you do a video on how you do your modelin/texturin/rendering
2016-03-30 03:08:11	Neocraftz1553	but I understand, its hard to record blender
2016-03-30 03:08:13	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-03-30 03:08:23	Neocraftz1553	maybe search it up?
2016-03-30 03:08:31	Neocraftz1553	I might search it up later...
2016-03-30 03:08:42	Neocraftz1553	really want to do some speed modeling
2016-03-30 03:09:58	Scruffy	I'm not good at modeling, but perhaps I can do a video on how I come up with materials/how they work in general
2016-03-30 03:10:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-30 03:11:05	Neocraftz1553	I hate stitching many vertices
2016-03-30 03:11:10	Neocraftz1553	grab two, merge
2016-03-30 03:11:15	Neocraftz1553	grab two, merge
2016-03-30 03:11:17	Neocraftz1553	repeat
2016-03-30 03:11:44	Neocraftz1553	finally
2016-03-30 03:11:58	Neocraftz1553	I was doing it for the last 15 messages
2016-03-30 03:12:05	Neocraftz1553	 10 mins, I thin?
2016-03-30 03:12:12	Neocraftz1553	probably 2, I don't know
2016-03-30 03:12:54	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-30 03:15:21	Neocraftz1553	ok, looking good so far
2016-03-30 03:15:34	Neocraftz1553	Gray and Red will probably be the color scheme
2016-03-30 03:15:40	Scruffy	neat!
2016-03-30 03:15:48	Neocraftz1553	then later, White and Lime...
2016-03-30 03:15:55	Neocraftz1553	or maybe light blue....
2016-03-30 03:15:58	Neocraftz1553	hmm....
2016-03-30 03:16:01	Neocraftz1553	maybe
2016-03-30 03:17:22	Scruffy	Maybe draw it first
2016-03-30 03:18:03	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 03:18:06	Neocraftz1553	Not the best drawer...
2016-03-30 03:18:26	Neocraftz1553	I mean, I'd get kicked outta art class cause I can't draw very well
2016-03-30 03:18:33	Neocraftz1553	I'm serious...
2016-03-30 03:18:48	Neocraftz1553	But I do know, it is looking good
2016-03-30 03:19:23	Scruffy	Don't worry, you don't get kicked out for your skill
2016-03-30 03:19:36	Scruffy	Just for your effort level
2016-03-30 03:19:59	Neocraftz1553	I try hard, it looks like a kindergardener drew it
2016-03-30 03:20:17	Neocraftz1553	With a pen in his nose
2016-03-30 03:23:03	Neocraftz1553	THEY
2016-03-30 03:23:04	Neocraftz1553	ARE
2016-03-30 03:23:07	Neocraftz1553	HORRIBLE
2016-03-30 03:23:29	Neocraftz1553	BU!
2016-03-30 03:23:36	Neocraftz1553	*But
2016-03-30 03:23:54	Neocraftz1553	They are useing blender in Computer class, so thats a plus
2016-03-30 03:24:14	Neocraftz1553	To make animations, renders, modelz
2016-03-30 03:24:18	Scruffy	Neat
2016-03-30 03:25:32	Neocraftz1553	Oh, Man
2016-03-30 03:25:39	Neocraftz1553	I looking awsoms
2016-03-30 03:25:43	Neocraftz1553	awsome
2016-03-30 03:31:36	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 03:31:54	Neocraftz1553	Can you link me to the KHA ship?
2016-03-30 03:32:21	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:PF_KHA_Lander.png
2016-03-30 03:32:44	Neocraftz1553	Ah, the KHA Lander
2016-03-30 03:34:06	Neocraftz1553	Its as awsome as I remembered it to be
2016-03-30 03:34:06	Neocraftz1553	Actually, even better than I remembered it to be
2016-03-30 03:34:06	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 03:34:06	Neocraftz1553	did you use textures on i?
2016-03-30 03:34:08	Neocraftz1553	or bump maps
2016-03-30 03:34:16	Neocraftz1553	baking?
2016-03-30 03:36:29	Neocraftz1553	I'd like to know how'd you model it
2016-03-30 03:36:33	Neocraftz1553	extrudin?
2016-03-30 03:36:35	Scruffy	Bump maps
2016-03-30 03:36:41	Neocraftz1553	UV mapping?
2016-03-30 03:36:41	Scruffy	And yes, a lot of extruding
2016-03-30 03:36:54	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see
2016-03-30 03:36:57	Scruffy	Little UV mapping, a lot of the parts don't have textures
2016-03-30 03:38:56	Neocraftz1553	Empty Textures, huh
2016-03-30 03:38:58	Neocraftz1553	or materials
2016-03-30 03:39:15	Scruffy	Right, just empty materials
2016-03-30 03:39:25	Scruffy	But the side has a bump map
2016-03-30 03:40:24	Neocraftz1553	I see...
2016-03-30 03:40:39	Neocraftz1553	The logo?
2016-03-30 03:40:43	Neocraftz1553	Texture, perhaps?
2016-03-30 03:41:58	Scruffy	The logo is a texture, that I had to UV map
2016-03-30 03:42:23	Scruffy	As well as the floor of the deck and the radar dish: both are UV mapped textures (the same one)
2016-03-30 03:43:09	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok
2016-03-30 03:43:57	Neocraftz1553	Hey, uh, do you still have the model
2016-03-30 03:44:20	Neocraftz1553	I was thinking maybe try rendering it in Cycles, to see how it comes out
2016-03-30 03:46:12	Scruffy	Sure, but it's not rigged or anything; it's still all seperate shapes
2016-03-30 03:46:23	Scruffy	And I no longer have the bump map or the logo textures
2016-03-30 03:47:02	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 03:47:02	Neocraftz1553	I can try to remake the logo...
2016-03-30 03:47:02	Neocraftz1553	or you can get it from fanon...
2016-03-30 03:47:05	Neocraftz1553	not sure about the bump map...
2016-03-30 03:52:15	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-30 03:52:27	Neocraftz1553	HMMMMMMMMM.....
2016-03-30 03:53:04	Scruffy	Here's the blend file
2016-03-30 03:53:16	Scruffy	I actually did have all those textures; they should be packed in here
2016-03-30 03:53:17	Scruffy	https://www.dropbox.com/s/5g7hij0x7qavdp2/KHA%20Lander.blend?dl=0

2016-03-30 19:17:20	Neocraftz1553	Enemies should be able to drop spoils (treasures, pellets, etc.)
2016-03-30 19:17:37	Neocraftz1553	found it on a list of things he might never do
2016-03-30 19:20:41	Neocraftz1553	I needed to ask him how I get the code to the engine, how to re-compile it, and run it successfully
2016-03-30 19:21:03	Neocraftz1553	maybe I can ask J for help later on, when I run into trouble...
2016-03-30 19:21:27	Neocraftz1553	or not, if he's not here/just staring at the screen deciding whether or not to answer
2016-03-30 19:21:40	Yoshi2	or on vacation
2016-03-30 19:21:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2016-03-30 19:30:53	@Espyo	I tried to set up Testyo to auto-join with me

2016-03-30 19:31:15	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2016-03-30 19:31:16	@Espyo	manual boot for now
2016-03-30 19:31:29	@Espyo	anyway Neo, to get the code, you'll need git
2016-03-30 19:31:35	@Espyo	if you were on Linux, this would be simple
2016-03-30 19:31:39	Neocraftz1553	Github?
2016-03-30 19:31:44	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-03-30 19:31:47	@Espyo	but you're not, so you'll be pretty close to committing suicide
2016-03-30 19:31:55	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-30 19:31:56	@Espyo	GitHub is the site
2016-03-30 19:32:00	Neocraftz1553	tell me how
2016-03-30 19:32:07	@Espyo	git is the... well, "mechanic" behind managing code
2016-03-30 19:32:16	@Espyo	okay, you know the history of a page on a wiki?
2016-03-30 19:32:17	Yoshi2	Espyo: would mingw on windows work to compile the code?
2016-03-30 19:32:17	Neocraftz1553	on VS
2016-03-30 19:32:30	@Espyo	it shows all the changes made
2016-03-30 19:32:35	@Espyo	who made them, and what lines got added and removed?
2016-03-30 19:32:42	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-03-30 19:32:43	@Espyo	Yoshi2: hahahahaha no
2016-03-30 19:32:47	Neocraftz1553	saw the code before
2016-03-30 19:32:49	@Espyo	git is basically the same thing
2016-03-30 19:32:56	@Espyo	it keeps track of my additions and removals
2016-03-30 19:33:03	@Espyo	and makes it easier to share code
2016-03-30 19:33:12	Neocraftz1553	oooh, I see
2016-03-30 19:33:13	@Espyo	since you're on windows and using visual studio, I highly recommend you download and install GitExtensions
2016-03-30 19:33:22	Neocraftz1553	Where?
2016-03-30 19:33:25	@Espyo	it's a program/framework/whatever that runs git
2016-03-30 19:33:28	@Espyo	well, it's a standard program
2016-03-30 19:33:33	@Espyo	so just get it off the internet and install it like normal
2016-03-30 19:33:40	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-30 19:33:50	@Espyo	technically, you can just get all the code without getting git involved
2016-03-30 19:33:53	@Espyo	you know what, that might be better
2016-03-30 19:34:02	@Espyo	because if you can't compile the code, it's no use setting up git
2016-03-30 19:34:09	@Espyo	on my project's GitHub page
2016-03-30 19:34:17	@Espyo	there's a "download ZIP" button somewhere
2016-03-30 19:34:25	@Espyo	you can just use that to download a zip file with the full code
2016-03-30 19:34:36	Neocraftz1553	ah ok
2016-03-30 19:34:58	Neocraftz1553	hmm..
2016-03-30 19:35:23	Neocraftz1553	how do I see the code?
2016-03-30 19:35:38	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2016-03-30 19:35:42	@Espyo	the code is simple .h and .cpp files
2016-03-30 19:35:49	@Espyo	you can open them up with notepad or anything of the sort
2016-03-30 19:35:54	Neocraftz1553	ah, wait
2016-03-30 19:35:56	@Espyo	but with the code, you also get a visual studio project
2016-03-30 19:36:00	Neocraftz1553	I found downloap .zip
2016-03-30 19:36:04	@Espyo	so you can open that project and get the same "environment" I use
2016-03-30 19:36:17	Neocraftz1553	whats it called?
2016-03-30 19:36:21	Neocraftz1553	is it C#
2016-03-30 19:36:39	@Espyo	what's what called?

2016-03-30 19:44:50	@Espyo	what version are YOU using?
2016-03-30 19:44:51	Neocraftz1553	I'm going to upgrade it, if I screw up something I'll retry it

2016-03-30 19:45:53	@Espyo	but yeah, you can safely upgrade it
2016-03-30 19:46:00	@Espyo	oh who am I kidding, nothing's "safe" with visual studio
2016-03-30 19:46:10	@Espyo	but it SHOULD be mostly successful...

2016-03-30 19:46:40	Neocraftz1553	I THINK it was successful
2016-03-30 19:46:57	@Espyo	eh, probably
2016-03-30 19:47:02	@Espyo	okay, you'll need Allegro before you continue
2016-03-30 19:47:29	@Espyo	Allegro is the library I used to handle all of the user inputs, window drawing, etc.

2016-03-30 20:17:31	Yoshi2	but the decompiler isn't perfect and on some files it fails entirely

2016-03-30 21:13:55	Neocraftz1553	I ask, because A: The textures are for a Calcified Crushblat

2016-03-30 23:30:21	Neocraftz1553	How did you light your enemy renders, Scruffy?
2016-03-30 23:32:57	Scruffy	Well the old ones I did with just one sun lamp
2016-03-30 23:33:17	Neocraftz1553	Wooly Bulborb-Wise
2016-03-30 23:33:24	Neocraftz1553	*Woolly
2016-03-30 23:33:46	Scruffy	The newest ones I do with three sun lamps: a main light in front, a softer fill light on the side, and a back light behind it that's usually about as bright as the lamp in front
2016-03-30 23:34:05	Scruffy	For the Woolly Bulborb I think I actually used a Meshlight for the front main light
2016-03-30 23:34:27	Neocraftz1553	A Meshlight.... interesting
2016-03-30 23:34:40	Neocraftz1553	what color?
2016-03-30 23:34:42	Neocraftz1553	white?
2016-03-30 23:34:57	Neocraftz1553	I thought you used the noise texture trick
2016-03-30 23:35:09	Neocraftz1553	you know, the one with the leaves and stuff
2016-03-30 23:35:16	Neocraftz1553	leaves and stuff?
2016-03-30 23:35:20	Neocraftz1553	the leaf shadows
2016-03-30 23:35:27	Scruffy	Not for enemy renders
2016-03-30 23:35:48	Scruffy	When Nintendo comes out with character art like that, they use unperturbed light sources
2016-03-30 23:36:30	Scruffy	I only use leaf shadows when there's a background that would make them appropriate
2016-03-30 23:36:42	Neocraftz1553	so, light without reflections...
2016-03-30 23:36:43	Neocraftz1553	got it
2016-03-30 23:37:00	Scruffy	Also the Meshlight by default uses an algorithm called Temperature to determine its color
2016-03-30 23:37:15	Scruffy	I had it at 5000 in the Woolly Bulborb render, with a brightness of 6
2016-03-30 23:37:21	Scruffy	just behind the camera
2016-03-30 23:37:27	Neocraftz1553	Blender internal?
2016-03-30 23:37:31	Scruffy	cycles
2016-03-30 23:37:40	Scruffy	I don't think Internal supports meshlights
2016-03-30 23:37:40	Neocraftz1553	How do you make on like your
2016-03-30 23:37:45	Neocraftz1553	s
2016-03-30 23:37:56	Neocraftz1553	A mesh with emmision, right?
2016-03-30 23:38:22	Scruffy	Yeah, go to add mesh and the very last option should be meshlight
2016-03-30 23:38:41	Scruffy	Although you could always create one yourself by making any object and giving it an Emission material
2016-03-30 23:38:51	Neocraftz1553	nope
2016-03-30 23:38:51	Scruffy	That only works in Cycles
2016-03-30 23:39:18	Neocraftz1553	The add meshlight feature is in 2.77 I think
2016-03-30 23:39:27	Scruffy	It was there way before that
2016-03-30 23:39:27	Neocraftz1553	I'm stull on 2.7b
2016-03-30 23:39:36	Scruffy	I had it in 2.72
2016-03-30 23:39:42	Neocraftz1553	hmmm....
2016-03-30 23:39:47	Scruffy	And it should come right out of the box
2016-03-30 23:39:53	Scruffy	You went to Add>Mesh right?
2016-03-30 23:39:55	Neocraftz1553	Nah
2016-03-30 23:40:02	Neocraftz1553	I'm way before that
2016-03-30 23:40:16	Neocraftz1553	No, nevermind
2016-03-30 23:40:26	Neocraftz1553	yes I went there...
2016-03-30 23:40:27	Neocraftz1553	hmmm
2016-03-30 23:40:29	Neocraftz1553	 2.76
2016-03-30 23:40:40	Neocraftz1553	b
2016-03-30 23:41:33	Scruffy	Well you can always create one from scratch: it's easy
2016-03-30 23:41:49	Scruffy	Just create a plane or any shape, and give it a material with the Emission shader
2016-03-30 23:41:49	Neocraftz1553	steps?
2016-03-30 23:41:56	Neocraftz1553	mhmm...
2016-03-30 23:42:01	Scruffy	Then set the color and brightness and that
2016-03-30 23:42:04	Scruffy	is it
2016-03-30 23:42:20	Scruffy	Although mesh-based light emission is known to be noisy
2016-03-30 23:42:34	Neocraftz1553	very
2016-03-30 23:42:36	Scruffy	I just used it in the Woolly render to try it
2016-03-30 23:42:52	Neocraftz1553	behind the camera?
2016-03-30 23:43:00	Neocraftz1553	like, straight behind it
2016-03-30 23:43:02	Scruffy	or out of view
2016-03-30 23:43:12	Scruffy	Wherever you think the light is best suited
2016-03-30 23:43:30	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-03-30 23:45:08	Neocraftz1553	Tip: Don't use Meshlights on lossy materials
2016-03-30 23:45:11	Neocraftz1553	Glossy
2016-03-30 23:45:17	Neocraftz1553	They reflect it
2016-03-30 23:45:31	Neocraftz1553	not neccessarily bad, just increase the size
2016-03-30 23:45:57	Scruffy	All glossy surfaces are going to reflect lights of any kind
2016-03-30 23:46:34	Neocraftz1553	But since the light is in the shape of a square/rectangle...
2016-03-30 23:46:48	Scruffy	Ah I see what you're saying
2016-03-30 23:47:02	Scruffy	So you could make it out of a sphere if you want a round light refleciton
2016-03-30 23:47:12	Scruffy	reflection*
2016-03-30 23:47:42	Scruffy	brb
2016-03-30 23:47:47	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-30 23:50:15	Testyo	and then I realized I should replace it
2016-03-30 23:51:17	Neocraftz1553	Testyo lm
2016-03-30 23:51:17	Testyo	I said and then I realized I should replace it because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages and then I realized I should add an o to resemble my EspYO and we... can't replace it.

2016-03-30 23:59:49	@Espyo	I'm really liking how it's turning out, but I'll still need some critical adviec
2016-03-30 23:59:50	@Espyo	*advice
2016-03-30 23:59:54	@Espyo	agreed, PikFan
2016-03-31 00:00:02	Neocraftz1553	on what?
2016-03-31 00:00:05	@PikFan	considering how small the Pikmin fandom is
2016-03-31 00:00:14	@Espyo	I might as well send you guys the current WIP so you can judge it
2016-03-31 00:00:17	Scruffy	I'll upload the arrangement so you guys can hear it, if you'd like
2016-03-31 00:00:18	@Espyo	and then let me know what you think tomorrow
2016-03-31 00:00:26	Scruffy	Sure!
2016-03-31 00:00:27	@Espyo	instead of me still having to wait for you lot to join tomorrow before giving feedback
2016-03-31 00:00:33	@Espyo	gotta crunch all the time that we can
2016-03-31 00:00:35	@Espyo	tomorrow's the deadline
2016-03-31 00:00:39	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-31 00:00:41	@Espyo	and I still want to expand a bit on the Color Splash stuff
2016-03-31 00:00:48	Neocraftz1553	wait, what happened during the few seconds I was gone?!?
2016-03-31 00:01:08	@PikFan	Espyo was saying that he's very close to finishing the Pik-Min poster
2016-03-31 00:01:18	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-03-31 00:01:27	@PikFan	oh, btw, in the article draft you sent us, I noticed a link to Nintendo Cinematic Universe
2016-03-31 00:01:29	Neocraftz1553	I could criticize 
2016-03-31 00:01:35	@PikFan	will that be getting its own article, too?
2016-03-31 00:02:26	@Espyo	yep

2016-03-31 00:03:36	@Espyo	I'd suggest MemoServ, but I never notice when MemoServ tells me somebody left a memo
2016-03-31 00:03:37	@PikFan	it's turning out really nicely
2016-03-31 00:03:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-03-31 00:03:51	@Espyo	the text at the bottom and the transparency on the sides is of course to be fixed
2016-03-31 00:03:53	Scruffy	Beautiful
2016-03-31 00:03:54	Neocraftz1553	MemoServ doesn't really notify
2016-03-31 00:03:55	@Espyo	but everything else is pretty final
2016-03-31 00:04:04	@Espyo	gonna go now, night
2016-03-31 00:04:09	@PikFan	my only thing is "From the studio that brought you Pikmin: Pik-Min"
2016-03-31 00:04:16	@PikFan	that seems a bit...redundant
2016-03-31 00:04:22	@PikFan	but eh, it can't be helped

2016-03-31 00:04:37	@Espyo	it's weird, but I guess it adds to the whole idea

2016-03-31 00:05:38	Neocraftz1553	The more the merrier
2016-03-31 00:05:44	@PikFan	ahhh, gotcha
2016-03-31 00:05:46	@Espyo	(guy on the top right is Ant-Man in this movie)
2016-03-31 00:05:48	Scruffy	Oh also Espyo tomorrow I can send you a texture of text that normally appears at the bottom of movie posters
2016-03-31 00:05:58	Scruffy	It's gibberish but it looks really authentic
2016-03-31 00:06:12	Scruffy	Saying directors, producers, stuff like that
2016-03-31 00:06:16	@Espyo	hmm, might be a bit too fake
2016-03-31 00:06:21	@PikFan	wait
2016-03-31 00:06:23	@Espyo	I'll try to keep the text simple, but I'll think about it
2016-03-31 00:06:28	@PikFan	what about Koppai text?
2016-03-31 00:06:28	Scruffy	Alright
2016-03-31 00:06:45	@Espyo	eeeeh, iunno

2016-03-31 00:06:57	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-03-31 00:07:01	@Espyo	secondly, the real movie doesn't have anything cryptic
2016-03-31 00:07:05	@Espyo	we can't deviate too much
2016-03-31 00:07:11	@Espyo	the fun is in seeing all the parallels we can come up with

2016-03-31 00:08:16	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-03-31 00:08:32	Scruffy	Like I said, this is a rough cut, I just wanted to get it recorded today so I speed-practiced and recorded it with my available technology
2016-03-31 00:08:39	Neocraftz1553	music usually takes you a little longer, so this is exiting
2016-03-31 00:08:48	Scruffy	It's a bit loose, but also quite a bit of it is based on improvisation
2016-03-31 00:08:49	Neocraftz1553	Exiting? exciting
2016-03-31 00:09:13	Scruffy	So I made some parts of it up as I played
2016-03-31 00:09:16	Neocraftz1553	ah, so it improvised music
2016-03-31 00:09:33	Scruffy	Also it's a medley of various themes the Vehemoth Phosbat has
2016-03-31 00:09:47	Scruffy	Again, of loose inspiration
2016-03-31 00:09:53	Scruffy	Okay, no more delays

2016-03-31 00:27:00	Neocraftz1553	My phone likes replacing .blend with .bin and . mp3 with .mpga apparently
2016-03-31 00:27:24	Scruffy	I tried to record this in a practice room in my college's music hall, but there are always people talking outside
2016-03-31 00:27:47	@PikFan	oh
2016-03-31 00:27:56	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-03-31 00:27:59	@PikFan	I thought you had arranged this in a music program, heh
2016-03-31 00:28:14	Scruffy	No, I played all this today on piano
2016-03-31 00:28:17	@PikFan	wow
2016-03-31 00:28:21	Neocraftz1553	Thats pretty unique
2016-03-31 00:28:22	@PikFan	that's impressive
2016-03-31 00:28:25	Neocraftz1553	and dedicated
2016-03-31 00:28:26	Scruffy	And, my lazy self, I haven't written it down yet
2016-03-31 00:28:29	Neocraftz1553	^^
2016-03-31 00:28:45	@PikFan	wait, so
2016-03-31 00:28:56	@PikFan	you just...came up with all of this...in your head?
2016-03-31 00:28:59	@PikFan	okay
2016-03-31 00:29:00	Scruffy	yeah
2016-03-31 00:29:06	@PikFan	that's even more dedicated
2016-03-31 00:29:20	@PikFan	but.../how/
2016-03-31 00:30:40	Scruffy	I have a condition called absolute pitch (sometimes called perfect pitch, but I don't like calling it that), where my auditory cortex can store and recall sounds abnormally well
2016-03-31 00:31:03	Scruffy	So I just listen to the song enough and I can figure out the melody and harmony
2016-03-31 00:31:12	Neocraftz1553	Pitch Perfect xD
2016-03-31 00:31:19	Neocraftz1553	but that is awsome, Scruff!!
2016-03-31 00:31:25	Neocraftz1553	*Scruffy
2016-03-31 00:31:34	Scruffy	But I still have to translate that into good piano playing, which is the hard part :P
2016-03-31 00:31:42	Neocraftz1553	True 
2016-03-31 00:31:45	Scruffy	I certainly don't have that down yet
2016-03-31 00:31:50	@PikFan	how convenient
2016-03-31 00:31:56	Neocraftz1553	just listen to your recording
2016-03-31 00:32:10	Neocraftz1553	I think it doesn't want to download...
2016-03-31 00:32:15	Neocraftz1553	hmmmmmmmmm
2016-03-31 00:32:49	@PikFan	woah, it's a condition found only in 1 out of 10,000
2016-03-31 00:33:13	Neocraftz1553	we have a rare freind here
2016-03-31 00:33:14	@PikFan	that's amazing that you've got such a rare, helpful condition!
2016-03-31 00:33:27	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-31 00:33:32	Scruffy	But it's a blessing and a curse
2016-03-31 00:33:43	@PikFan	a...curse?
2016-03-31 00:33:43	Neocraftz1553	FNaF
2016-03-31 00:33:46	Neocraftz1553	perhaps
2016-03-31 00:34:00	Scruffy	I don't hear music the same way others do
2016-03-31 00:34:10	Scruffy	I can't focus on much else with music playing
2016-03-31 00:34:10	Neocraftz1553	hmmm.....?
2016-03-31 00:34:21	@PikFan	oh
2016-03-31 00:34:21	Neocraftz1553	OH, I see...
2016-03-31 00:34:27	@PikFan	that makes sense
2016-03-31 00:34:35	Neocraftz1553	"So whistle while you work...
2016-03-31 00:34:49	Neocraftz1553	actually, don't do that
2016-03-31 00:34:51	@PikFan	I was wondering if it's because you hear things that you don't want to hear, but it sticks with you
2016-03-31 00:34:59	Scruffy	That too
2016-03-31 00:35:12	Scruffy	And also I have trouble explaining music to other people
2016-03-31 00:35:17	@PikFan	that sucks, sorry to hear that
2016-03-31 00:35:26	@PikFan	mm
2016-03-31 00:35:31	Neocraftz1553	Trouble explaining?
2016-03-31 00:35:45	Neocraftz1553	I have trouble explaining anything at all :|
2016-03-31 00:35:52	Neocraftz1553	"Ahem, class"
2016-03-31 00:36:17	Neocraftz1553	"Well, you see, my freinds, this is a presintation I made to get a grade"
2016-03-31 00:36:32	Neocraftz1553	"plrase pretend you are interested, so I can pass"
2016-03-31 00:36:37	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-03-31 00:36:40	Neocraftz1553	I wish
2016-03-31 00:36:52	Neocraftz1553	I hardly speak when presenting...
2016-03-31 00:37:48	Neocraftz1553	Like my renders...
2016-03-31 00:38:16	Neocraftz1553	people ask what they are, and I'm just sitting there like"uh...."
2016-03-31 00:38:32	Neocraftz1553	"It's.... a picture..."
2016-03-31 00:38:40	@PikFan	people at school?
2016-03-31 00:39:11	Neocraftz1553	yup

2016-03-31 00:40:36	@PikFan	people never ask what I'm doing lol
2016-03-31 00:40:45	Neocraftz1553	And at work, I get more time, and it's not as awkward
2016-03-31 00:40:48	Neocraftz1553	lucky
2016-03-31 00:42:18	Neocraftz1553	People are like "What is that" "It looks weird" You are so weird"
2016-03-31 00:42:29	Neocraftz1553	I just shrug them off
2016-03-31 00:42:51	Neocraftz1553	Haters gonna hate, right?
2016-03-31 00:43:37	@PikFan	they say it's weird? rude
2016-03-31 00:43:46	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, I'm just about done with the Sickly Wollywog render
2016-03-31 00:44:00	Neocraftz1553	they say its weird, yes
2016-03-31 00:44:03	Neocraftz1553	rude, true
2016-03-31 00:44:23	Neocraftz1553	especially when the refer to me as the "weird dude"
2016-03-31 00:45:17	Neocraftz1553	But you can't stop when someone(or a class) doesn't like your work
2016-03-31 00:47:53	Neocraftz1553	Ok, almost done, just need to finish some lighting

2016-03-31 01:06:12	@PikFan	your renders are getting better
2016-03-31 01:06:28	@PikFan	it doesn't look so... low-polygon anymore
2016-03-31 01:07:05	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-03-31 01:07:34	Neocraftz1553	I use subdivision surface more nos
2016-03-31 01:07:37	Neocraftz1553	*now
2016-03-31 01:07:49	Neocraftz1553	It smoothes them out, but slows them down
2016-03-31 01:08:01	@PikFan	m
2016-03-31 01:08:03	@PikFan	*mm
2016-03-31 01:08:17	Neocraftz1553	Stay tuned, I think Cheepy-Cheepy would appreciate if I made a gameplay render
2016-03-31 01:08:50	Neocraftz1553	what character should I make fight the Wollywog- oh wait....
2016-03-31 01:08:53	Neocraftz1553	Crap....
2016-03-31 01:09:20	Neocraftz1553	The main character in his gane is the only character model I don't have....
2016-03-31 01:09:28	Neocraftz1553	The President...
2016-03-31 01:09:38	Neocraftz1553	hmm... I gues I COULD Model him...
2016-03-31 01:10:05	Neocraftz1553	But I'll use Olimar as a placeholder
2016-03-31 01:10:22	@PikFan	hmm
2016-03-31 01:13:38	Neocraftz1553	Another reason I'm doing it:
2016-03-31 01:13:46	Neocraftz1553	I love controlling water in blender
2016-03-31 01:13:52	Neocraftz1553	liquids

2016-03-31 01:14:50	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-03-31 01:16:34	Neocraftz1553	apparently, resizing a camera will freeze blender 
2016-03-31 01:16:47	Neocraftz1553	err....

2016-03-31 01:43:22	Scruffy	Woah, neat
2016-03-31 01:43:28	Scruffy	Where did you get that color?
2016-03-31 01:43:50	Neocraftz1553	Ithink we should change the Featured photo to Scruffys Formidable Oak Render
2016-03-31 01:43:58	Neocraftz1553	The lighting :)
2016-03-31 01:44:56	@PikFan	I personally like the Garden of Hope render

2016-03-31 01:45:25	Neocraftz1553	I like desert ish areas

2016-03-31 01:46:31	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, how do you make it so that only whats inside the cameras frame gets rendered on veiwport
2016-03-31 01:47:15	Scruffy	That's an addon I had to download
2016-03-31 01:47:42	Scruffy	i believe it's called Amaranth Toolset
2016-03-31 01:48:03	Neocraftz1553	Oh...
2016-03-31 01:48:17	Neocraftz1553	I think I can extract it from the PFC render
2016-03-31 01:49:06	Neocraftz1553	not sure
2016-03-31 01:49:26	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-31 01:51:47	Neocraftz1553	Hey Scruffy, mind if I make a render of Olimar near the KHA Lander under an Onion?
2016-03-31 01:51:47	Neocraftz1553	I'll need the onion model though...

2016-03-31 02:13:39	@PikFan	nope
2016-03-31 02:14:00	@PikFan	to tell the truth, I don't really feel motivated to...
2016-03-31 02:14:09	@PikFan	sorry
2016-03-31 02:14:34	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok
2016-03-31 02:26:06	Scruffy	just made another one
2016-03-31 02:26:15	Scruffy	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:The_Pikpik_Cruiser.png
2016-03-31 02:26:37	Scruffy	I feel like I'm going to end up having to make this a separate fangame
2016-03-31 02:27:24	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-31 02:27:27	Neocraftz1553	The karts?
2016-03-31 02:27:30	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-03-31 02:27:33	Scruffy	Pikmin Kart U
2016-03-31 02:27:34	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-03-31 02:27:40	Scruffy	Since Pikmin Kart is already a thing
2016-03-31 02:27:47	Neocraftz1553	It wouldn't be bad, though
2016-03-31 02:27:51	@PikFan	oh yeah, how's that video coming along? not to pressure you or anything, just wondering
2016-03-31 02:28:05	Scruffy	The karting video? Well these karts show my progress
2016-03-31 02:28:08	Neocraftz1553	I think it would be pretty complete, with the karts and all
2016-03-31 02:28:10	Scruffy	I have 10 of 12 so far
2016-03-31 02:28:24	Scruffy	But of course, were it a game, there would be more than 12
2016-03-31 02:28:33	Neocraftz1553	Looks cool
2016-03-31 02:28:42	Neocraftz1553	Like a toy
2016-03-31 02:43:52	Neocraftz1553	any kart ideas?
2016-03-31 02:44:50	Scruffy	let's see, I need two more for this video
2016-03-31 02:44:56	Scruffy	PikFan, any suggestions?
2016-03-31 02:45:02	@PikFan	hm
2016-03-31 02:45:02	Scruffy	Or requests for karts?
2016-03-31 02:45:11	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-03-31 02:46:36	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmm
2016-03-31 02:50:38	@PikFan	I can't think of anything...
2016-03-31 02:50:41	@PikFan	I'm sorry
2016-03-31 02:50:52	Neocraftz1553	I got one...
2016-03-31 02:50:58	@PikFan	though, I have to say: /wow/ http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/f/f3/The_Wraithmobile.png
2016-03-31 02:51:18	@PikFan	that refraction though
2016-03-31 02:52:37	Scruffy	Heh, thank you
2016-03-31 02:53:14	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy, you remember the Onion kart I told you last time?
2016-03-31 02:53:26	Scruffy	Mhm?
2016-03-31 02:53:36	Neocraftz1553	maybe make one like:
2016-03-31 02:54:33	Neocraftz1553	Onion, empty, four wheeled, Can be changed to colors Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Gray, White, Pink, like a Glass sphere
2016-03-31 02:54:36	Neocraftz1553	Top optional
2016-03-31 02:54:59	Neocraftz1553	so you can take off the flower on top if the light doesn't get rendered in
2016-03-31 02:55:20	Neocraftz1553	Make the inside like the inside of the KHA Lander
2016-03-31 02:55:22	@PikFan	well
2016-03-31 02:55:26	@PikFan	I have an idea
2016-03-31 02:55:37	@PikFan	perhaps you could use a fruit
2016-03-31 02:55:51	@PikFan	you've already used a ship part and a treasure
2016-03-31 02:56:22	Scruffy	When did I use a treasure?
2016-03-31 02:56:25	Scruffy	Good ideas though
2016-03-31 02:56:32	Scruffy	Those both sound really good
2016-03-31 02:56:34	@PikFan	the Crystal Wheel
2016-03-31 02:57:05	Scruffy	Oh, I see, yeah
2016-03-31 02:57:26	Neocraftz1553	Oh, from P2
2016-03-31 02:57:27	Neocraftz1553	I think he meant it like a Crystal Nodule, but both are Crystal Nodules, so...
2016-03-31 02:57:58	@PikFan	heh
2016-03-31 02:58:01	Scruffy	Right, it covers both bases
2016-03-31 02:58:18	Neocraftz1553	thats a plus
2016-03-31 03:09:51	Neocraftz1553	Hey, Scruffy, mind if I use part of your music at the end of my videos
2016-03-31 03:10:16	Neocraftz1553	the parts where I show off fanon creations for the PFE
2016-03-31 03:13:51	Scruffy	Ummm
2016-03-31 03:14:51	Neocraftz1553	Its ok if its no
2016-03-31 03:18:05	Scruffy	Actually I'd prefer if you didn't
2016-03-31 03:18:11	Scruffy	It's only a rough cut
2016-03-31 03:18:27	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-03-31 03:18:38	Neocraftz1553	It sounds good, though...
2016-03-31 03:18:49	Neocraftz1553	should I wait untill you actually release it?
2016-03-31 03:18:57	Scruffy	Yeah

2016-03-31 17:47:36	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: so you petrified the long legs once, and then 5 times later, and it didn't instantly enrage?
2016-03-31 17:47:40	Neocraftz1553	'Cause it said on strategy that someone said that it instantly enrages once petrified
2016-03-31 17:48:01	Neocraftz1553	wait, let me see

2016-03-31 17:53:09	Yoshi2	only the wikia has the battle strategy o.o

2016-03-31 17:54:17	Neocraftz1553	I don't know, I saw the notice, so I decided to test that
2016-03-31 17:54:54	Neocraftz1553	And yes, it will go into rage mode(instantly, I don't know) if you attack it lots while petrified

2016-03-31 22:08:59	Testyo	dunno then, just be some setting on Dolphin that's disabled
2016-03-31 22:09:05	@J	blue would be closer to the original, and the red text would show up better

2016-03-31 22:10:44	@Espyo	the original poster had a background of a bridge, so I'm guessing, an important setting

2016-03-31 22:10:44	@J	just dropping in for a few minutes

2016-03-31 22:11:14	@J	the Pikmin one doesn't look like a bridge, is it?

2016-03-31 22:18:19	@J	Yoshi2: for Python?
2016-03-31 22:18:41	Yoshi2	preferably, yes
2016-03-31 22:19:25	@J	it's not great, I basically ended up reading ass the C++ stuff, then reading the pyqt notes on translating to Python
2016-03-31 22:19:48	Yoshi2	that's what I feared
2016-03-31 22:20:02	@J	once you have the basics though, the C++ referenc is all you need; it translates pretty easily into pyqt
2016-03-31 22:20:08	@J	*reference
2016-03-31 22:21:01	Yoshi2	mhm, the basics is all I'm looking for
2016-03-31 22:21:26	Neocraftz1553	hey J , have you ever tried to recompile Espyo's engine from code on Windows?
2016-03-31 22:21:56	@J	the only real concepts to understand are signals/slots, widgets and layouts, once you have those just read some examples
2016-03-31 22:21:58	@Espyo	reading ass the C++ stuff?
2016-03-31 22:22:07	@J	Neocraftz1553: no, I use Linux

2016-03-31 22:22:31	@J	my wifi connection went weird, so I typed out the whole sentence before it showed up
2016-03-31 22:22:33	@Espyo	I swear I couldn't tell what that was meant to be
2016-03-31 22:22:51	@Espyo	but before sending it?
2016-03-31 22:22:55	@Espyo	how's that wifi related?
2016-03-31 22:23:17	@J	it needs to send/receive traffic to show what I typed
2016-03-31 22:23:30	@J	since the terminal running on the Raspberry Pi needs to interpret the keypresses
