2015-08-31 13:40:06	@J	...tried to sew a trouser pocket, accidentally sewed it _across_ the pocket, so now both sides are stuck together
2015-08-31 13:56:56	Yoshi2	J: is there anything you can do about it, or is the pocket FUBAR?
2015-08-31 13:58:35	@J	it was fairly low down so it's probably fine
2015-08-31 13:58:51	@J	wouldn't have been hard to undo it though

2015-08-31 19:28:39	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-31 19:34:15	@J	oh, there was a thing
2015-08-31 19:34:28	@J	[20:27:33] @J https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/play-for-free-today/
2015-08-31 19:34:28	@J	[20:27:36] @J so this just happened
2015-08-31 19:34:28	@J	[20:27:41] @J this is the MMO I've been playing
2015-08-31 19:34:28	@J	[20:29:29] @J okay, looks like they restricted free accounts somewhat, but not in any way that sounds detrimental to playing, only to avoid bots
2015-08-31 19:35:55	@Espyo	hm, neat
2015-08-31 19:35:59	@Espyo	but not interested, sorry
2015-08-31 19:36:10	@Espyo	I THINK I've seen my boss browse through that page some weeks ago
2015-08-31 19:37:24	@J	it's dated 2 days ago
2015-08-31 19:37:36	@J	maybe you just saw the logo
2015-08-31 19:38:17	@Espyo	yeah
2015-08-31 19:39:12	@J	and yeah, I know you have so many other games to play and projects to work on
2015-08-31 19:39:16	@J	like me, actually
2015-08-31 19:39:29	@J	it's just interesting, the timing of it
2015-08-31 19:40:16	@J	and also an interesting thing in terms of gaming in general - I don't recall there ever being another MMO with free accounts as unrestricted as this
2015-08-31 19:42:54	@Espyo	hm, don't think I recall either
2015-08-31 20:03:43	Yoshi2	heeeey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-08-31 20:03:44	Testyo	and the rest... well, it's the BMS stuff is now officially up \o/

2015-09-01 19:31:05	Yoshi2	tl;dr: UM will remake levels from original mario games, mario clones, mario rom hacks, bootleg games
2015-09-01 19:31:13	Yoshi2	and the promo levels
2015-09-01 19:31:23	UltraMario	well
2015-09-01 19:31:31	UltraMario	not the main mario agmes
2015-09-01 19:31:32	UltraMario	:P
2015-09-01 19:31:35	UltraMario	also fangames too
2015-09-01 19:31:39	UltraMario	agmes
2015-09-01 19:31:40	UltraMario	games
2015-09-01 19:31:53	UltraMario	im not doing smb1, smb3, ect, im doing the obscure games :>
2015-09-01 19:31:59	UltraMario	like super mario bros. special
2015-09-01 19:32:04	Yoshi2	wot
2015-09-01 19:32:10	UltraMario	also obscure levels from games that aren't particularly obscure
2015-09-01 19:32:16	Yoshi2	I thought you were going to do the main games :L
2015-09-01 19:32:16	UltraMario	like world-e from SMA4
2015-09-01 19:32:19	UltraMario	.
2015-09-01 19:32:41	UltraMario	well yoshi2, i might do the main games after i do my obscure level project, but idk i have to see how that goes
2015-09-01 19:32:47	UltraMario	it's not a definite thing tho :P
2015-09-01 19:32:59	UltraMario	i figured a lot of people would be doing that anyway
2015-09-01 19:33:06	Yoshi2	well, makes sense that you'd not do the main games
2015-09-01 19:33:23	UltraMario	so i decided against it and instead figured id do levels that are obscure like the ones from Super Mario Bros. Special
2015-09-01 19:33:45	UltraMario	also Yoshi2 i noticed on the sidebar of the SMM subreddit it says "KEEP CALM 10 DAYS LEFT"
2015-09-01 19:33:46	UltraMario	HYPE
2015-09-01 19:34:31	Yoshi2	spoiler: SMM comes out in 10 days
2015-09-01 19:34:37	Yoshi2	that's why it says 10 days left
2015-09-01 19:34:49	UltraMario	i know
2015-09-01 19:34:50	UltraMario	:|
2015-09-01 19:34:54	UltraMario	IM NOT DUMB
2015-09-01 19:34:55	UltraMario	>:|
2015-09-01 19:35:27	Yoshi2	just making sure :p

2015-09-03 22:06:09	@J	I see
2015-09-03 22:06:16	@J	why not just plain icons?
2015-09-03 22:06:32	@Espyo	too bland?
2015-09-03 22:06:40	@Espyo	they just... don't FEEL right
2015-09-03 22:06:43	@Espyo	anyway, for context
2015-09-03 22:06:46	@Espyo	our enemy infoboxes are huge
2015-09-03 22:06:53	@Espyo	so we better move some info to its own table
2015-09-03 22:07:01	Pi	I have one suggestion for this though
2015-09-03 22:07:14	Pi	have it standardised and move it under a ==Stats== header
2015-09-03 22:07:21	@Espyo	of course
2015-09-03 22:07:29	@Espyo	though I was thinking of "parameters" instead
2015-09-03 22:07:32	@Espyo	not sure...
2015-09-03 22:07:36	@Espyo	there might even be a better word
2015-09-03 22:07:39	Pi	what is a parameter
2015-09-03 22:07:44	Pi	nobody knows what a parameter is
2015-09-03 22:07:48	Pi	everybody knows what stats
2015-09-03 22:07:50	Pi	are
2015-09-03 22:07:50	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-09-03 22:07:52	Pi	so go for stats
2015-09-03 22:07:56	@Espyo	I guess
2015-09-03 22:08:06	@J	3 then, I guess
2015-09-03 22:08:34	Pi	mine is 4 but it kind of failed
2015-09-03 22:08:37	Pi	at being good
2015-09-03 22:08:53	Pi	because I tried to make the images small enough to not make the rows super large
2015-09-03 22:09:09	Pi	but then the width of the ! game column got 2large
2015-09-03 22:09:25	@J	just make sure if you don't have text then the images have correct alt text
2015-09-03 22:09:34	@Espyo	*when the images?
2015-09-03 22:09:39	@J	no
2015-09-03 22:10:03	@Espyo	uh, you just meant "don't have the text AND a correct alt text", right?
2015-09-03 22:10:27	@J	no...
2015-09-03 22:10:35	@J	if there is no text separate from images
2015-09-03 22:10:43	@J	then images should have appropriate alt text
2015-09-03 22:10:48	@Espyo	oh

2015-09-07 21:14:53	@PikFan	they already have
2015-09-07 21:14:58	Klemen702	is this bigger awareness and people stuff etc. similar to how it was back 2 years ago?
2015-09-07 21:15:09	@PikFan	and will continue to do so as long as Pikmin Wiki is open
2015-09-07 21:15:12	@Espyo	well, not a penny of profit from Pikmin 4, then
2015-09-07 21:15:23	@Espyo	it'll cost them more to keep the wikia up than it will profit from having viewers

2015-09-07 21:18:45	Klemen702	i am not sure how to respond knowing what that means...
2015-09-07 21:18:49	En_Passant	Sadly, Pikmin Wikia still appears first when searching for "pikmin wiki"
2015-09-07 21:18:58	@PikFan	oh hey En_Passant
2015-09-07 21:19:07	@PikFan	and yes, unfortunately
2015-09-07 21:19:18	En_Passant	We're second, but after that is more Wikia results until you reach, funnily enough, Fanon
2015-09-07 21:19:29	En_Passant	Our Fanon, not Wikia's
2015-09-07 21:19:31	Klemen702	i think it's because
2015-09-07 21:19:41	Klemen702	people search ''pikmin wiki''
2015-09-07 21:19:43	@PikFan	the thing is, I discovered Fanon because I searched "orange bulborb"
2015-09-07 21:19:46	Klemen702	not pikipedia or pikmin wikipedia
2015-09-07 21:20:00	@PikFan	and I saw the page for the Orange Bulborb on Fanon
2015-09-07 21:26:09	@PikFan	guys, September 14th is the 5 year anniversary of moving away from wikia
2015-09-07 21:26:22	@PikFan	5 years...

2015-09-07 21:38:59	@Espyo	we'll win by being the only wiki with content
2015-09-07 21:38:59	--	Pidgeotto is now known as Kazooie
2015-09-07 21:39:07	@Espyo	most people will come to us, editors and readers alike
2015-09-07 21:39:17	@Espyo	and for those that don't, they'll go to the wikia, find 0 Pikmin 4 info, and search elsewhere
2015-09-07 21:39:30	@Espyo	we have to be aggressive now
2015-09-07 21:39:36	@PikFan	I have an idea
2015-09-07 21:39:38	@Espyo	if we see somebody register on the wikia, we have to talk to them
2015-09-07 21:39:48	@Espyo	if we see any sort of news, like a trailer, we HAVE to document it
2015-09-07 21:39:49	@J	[21:26:09] @PikFan guys, September 14th is the 5 year anniversary of moving away from wikia
2015-09-07 21:39:51	@J	feeling so old
2015-09-07 21:40:09	@Espyo	I'll write plans for handling trailers, the game's release, wikia events, etc.
2015-09-07 21:40:11	@Espyo	yikes, 5 years
2015-09-07 21:40:21	@Espyo	the wiki as a whole is going to be 10 soon, right?
2015-09-07 21:40:30	@PikFan	this December

2015-09-07 21:41:10	@PikFan	anyway, about my idea
2015-09-07 21:41:37	@Espyo	Testyo: alarm 3/12/2015 the wiki's 10th birthday
2015-09-07 21:41:38	Testyo	Done. I saved an alarm for 03/12/2015 00:00 (GMT), saying the wiki's 10th birthday.
2015-09-07 21:41:38	@PikFan	I think we should add false information to the most popular pages on Pikmin Wiki
2015-09-07 21:41:57	@Espyo	that could work, but we'd have to think really hard about how to pull it off right
2015-09-07 21:42:38	@J	midnight, nice
2015-09-07 21:42:40	@PikFan	it would technically be vandalism, but since the wikia staff doesn't have a clue about Pikmin, they would let it slip by
2015-09-07 21:43:07	<--	Yoshi2 (Yoshi2@lmwa-60-06-957-442.netcologne.de) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-09-07 21:43:08	@PikFan	like, for Red Bulborb, we could change the areas it's in
2015-09-07 21:43:39	@PikFan	and for Olimar, we could say that he's from Koppai, not Hocotate
2015-09-07 21:43:43	Klemen702	coudn't we just ask wikia to remove the wikia? (i feel like i read why it can't be removed before)
2015-09-07 21:43:53	@PikFan	they won't
2015-09-07 21:44:01	Klemen702	why not?
2015-09-07 21:44:07	@PikFan	because they insist on the users having a choice
2015-09-07 21:44:12	@PikFan	but really, it
2015-09-07 21:44:19	@PikFan	it's to get as much money as possible
2015-09-07 21:44:26	Klemen702	bloh
2015-09-07 21:44:47	@Espyo	yeah
2015-09-07 21:44:58	@Espyo	we tried asking, oh, we tried
2015-09-07 21:45:08	Klemen702	damn then
2015-09-07 21:45:18	Klemen702	then by ''deleting''
2015-09-07 21:45:24	Klemen702	we could just remove all the pages?
2015-09-07 21:45:31	Klemen702	and have the main have a link to this?
2015-09-07 21:45:33	@PikFan	they'd just restore them
2015-09-07 21:45:38	@PikFan	and remove the link
2015-09-07 21:45:42	@PikFan	and ban whoever did all of that
2015-09-07 21:45:54	Klemen702	welp
2015-09-07 21:45:58	Klemen702	my ideas = fail
2015-09-07 21:46:22	@PikFan	granted, it'd take some time for them to notice, but still
2015-09-07 21:47:48	Klemen702	actually
2015-09-07 21:47:52	Klemen702	about the vandalism thing
2015-09-07 21:48:06	Klemen702	if people read Olimar is from Koppai but notice he is from Hocotate
2015-09-07 21:48:10	Klemen702	woudn't they just fix it?
2015-09-07 21:48:50	@PikFan	anons can't edit the wiki afaik
2015-09-07 21:49:19	@Espyo	I think they can
2015-09-07 21:49:26	Klemen702	actually
2015-09-07 21:49:29	@Espyo	but at least the fact that the wrong info is there can drive people away to begin with
2015-09-07 21:49:31	Klemen702	if a wiki is popluar enough
2015-09-07 21:49:37	Klemen702	wikia can make it so anons can't edit
2015-09-07 21:49:54	@Espyo	hmm
2015-09-07 21:51:41	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2015-09-07 21:51:53	@PikFan	how come you made new templates for enemy info?
2015-09-07 21:53:32	@Espyo	people've been complaining the enemy infoboxes are huge towers
2015-09-07 21:53:47	@Espyo	now that I'm playing through Fire Emblem: Awakening, I go to the FE Wiki every once in a while
2015-09-07 21:53:57	@Espyo	and they put the weapons stats in a table like that
2015-09-07 21:54:06	@Espyo	and it's so organized and nice
2015-09-07 21:54:12	@Espyo	I asked the folks if they liked the idea
2015-09-07 21:54:15	@Espyo	and it was unanimous
2015-09-07 21:55:55	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-07 21:56:04	@PikFan	the infoboxes have never bothered me

2015-09-07 21:56:55	Klemen702	that stats infobox?
2015-09-07 21:57:06	Klemen702	nice new addition
2015-09-07 21:57:39	Klemen702	never knew winged pikmin can make more carriers
2015-09-07 21:58:07	--	UltraMarioWorld[NES] is now known as UltraMario
2015-09-07 22:03:11	@Espyo	they never really bothered me either
2015-09-07 22:03:20	@Espyo	but when some enemies have different seeds, carrying weights, etc.
2015-09-07 22:03:30	@Espyo	it really looks gruesome seeing all of that clumped info trying to behave on the infobox
2015-09-07 22:03:39	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-07 22:03:46	@Espyo	note that I already removed stuff from the Red Bulborb's infobox
2015-09-07 22:03:49	@Espyo	it used to be bigger
2015-09-07 22:03:59	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-07 22:04:14	@PikFan	how many enemies are left?
2015-09-07 22:05:07	Klemen702	9000
2015-09-07 22:05:18	Klemen702	hm
2015-09-07 22:05:22	Klemen702	here's an idea
2015-09-07 22:05:39	Klemen702	maybe a category could be made for enemy pages that are missing something
2015-09-07 22:05:47	Klemen702	like those infoboxes
2015-09-07 22:05:58	Klemen702	but not like stubs
2015-09-07 22:12:33	@Espyo	like 3/4 of the enemies
2015-09-07 22:12:55	@Espyo	by the time I'd finish categorizing and uncategorizing all of them, I'd do the infobox change already
2015-09-07 22:13:45	Klemen702	point :S

2015-09-07 22:16:18	@PikFan	uh, how?
2015-09-07 22:16:27	@PikFan	don't you need Pikmin to kill the Arachnode?
2015-09-07 22:17:15	Klemen702	i think all that is needed is 100 pikmin on the feild
2015-09-07 22:17:22	Klemen702	field*
2015-09-07 22:17:25	Klemen702	to find out ''what happens''
2015-09-07 22:17:29	@PikFan	no, they have to be buried
2015-09-07 22:17:34	Klemen702	but most likely the pikmin will sprout in the onion
2015-09-07 22:17:39	Klemen702	huh? why?
2015-09-07 22:18:03	@PikFan	because if 100 Pikmin were out on the field, one of them would be sent back to the Onion
2015-09-07 22:18:10	@PikFan	but if they were buried...
2015-09-07 22:18:29	@PikFan	you can't interact with buried Pikmin, except for plucking them
2015-09-07 22:18:42	Klemen702	ooh
2015-09-07 22:19:01	Klemen702	don't think it's possible with any onion then...
2015-09-07 22:19:13	Klemen702	unless hax
2015-09-07 22:19:13	@PikFan	it's possible in the first two games
2015-09-07 22:19:26	Klemen702	what are the effects in the first 2 games?
2015-09-07 22:19:31	@PikFan	but P3 has made it so there's an obstacle blocking all the Onions
2015-09-07 22:19:34	@PikFan	not sure
2015-09-07 22:19:38	Klemen702	actually
2015-09-07 22:19:44	Klemen702	it's not possible in pikmin 2
2015-09-07 22:19:58	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-09-07 22:19:58	Klemen702	there are atleast some wild pikmin in all the onion areas
2015-09-07 22:20:02	@PikFan	that's right

2015-09-07 22:21:12	@Espyo	about needing a Pikmin
2015-09-07 22:21:18	@Espyo	I think Scruffy added that, ask him
2015-09-07 22:21:23	@Espyo	I'm talking about the 100 limit article
2015-09-07 22:21:27	Klemen702	isn't there a glitch that allows you to get to the pink onion without the bridge?
2015-09-07 22:21:34	@Espyo	and Klemen702 yeah, I made icons for them by hand
2015-09-07 22:21:39	@Espyo	so everything would have a convenient article
2015-09-07 22:21:47	Klemen702	hold on
2015-09-07 22:23:30	Klemen702	about the glitch i mentioned
2015-09-07 22:23:48	Klemen702	the captains respawn somewhere in the top i noticed
2015-09-07 22:24:07	Klemen702	would it be possible if respawned on the right place, to punch the arachnode and kill it?

2015-09-07 22:26:18	@Espyo	you couldn't punch more than twice

2015-09-08 00:20:30	@PikFan	Espyo: I'm thinking about adding those new enemy templates
2015-09-08 00:20:43	@Espyo	go ahead
2015-09-08 00:20:46	@PikFan	one question though, what should I do about the regen rate?
2015-09-08 00:20:49	@Espyo	remember the ==Other information== section
2015-09-08 00:20:54	@Espyo	for P1 and P3, do Unknown
2015-09-08 00:20:57	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2015-09-08 00:20:58	@Espyo	unless you're VERY sure they don't regen
2015-09-08 00:21:00	@Espyo	for P2
2015-09-08 00:21:05	@Espyo	check the technical information table on the article
2015-09-08 00:21:09	@Espyo	if the regen is 0, put 0
2015-09-08 00:21:12	@Espyo	if not, put your mouse over it
2015-09-08 00:21:18	@Espyo	and it should tell you how much it heals per second
2015-09-08 00:21:25	@PikFan	hmm, okay
2015-09-08 00:21:47	@PikFan	did you already do all P1 enemies?
2015-09-08 00:21:51	@Espyo	almost all
2015-09-08 00:22:07	@PikFan	which ones are left
2015-09-08 00:23:01	@PikFan	oh, all up to Swooping Snitchbug
2015-09-08 00:23:12	@Espyo	I'd recommend going through WhatLinksHere
2015-09-08 00:23:17	@Espyo	for the enemy infobox
2015-09-08 00:23:25	@Espyo	because stuff like the Pikmin 3 unused enemies and all should be "converted" too
2015-09-08 00:24:01	@Espyo	going now, night
2015-09-08 00:24:05	@PikFan	speaking of P3 unused stuff, have you made any more discoveries?
2015-09-08 00:24:19	@Espyo	haven't really explored much

2015-09-08 19:22:23	@Espyo	refresh the page
2015-09-08 19:22:37	@Espyo	because the template tries to do math with what you feed it, and when you feed it the <ref>, it blows up

2015-09-08 19:23:07	@PikFan	still there

2015-09-08 19:32:03	@Espyo	not because it's a different article that it won't

2015-09-08 21:45:16	Klemen702	the path you are taking this story is interesting, as i said before, alot of character development seems to be put in, even in some of the non-important pikmin, as for improvements.... idk it's good enough already, prehaps some more development for Shock's friends?
2015-09-08 21:46:06	@PikFan	hm, yeah, I thought that I might've been paying less attention to his friends

2015-09-08 22:30:58	Klemen702	would japan version work?
2015-09-08 22:30:58	@Espyo	and if I try to copy actual save files, it'll always complain that it's the wrong game ID

2015-09-08 22:31:10	@Espyo	not sure, but the save file issue would exist anyway

2015-09-08 23:44:21	@PikFan	well, I'm glad that we're even getting a P4

2015-09-09 18:51:52	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-09-09 18:51:53	Testyo	others use a program on their computer to undo the import edit, but I don't know what that will do
2015-09-09 18:53:00	Klemen702	1 min brb
2015-09-09 18:55:49	Yoshi2	apparently Super Mario Sunshine has code related to multiplayer
2015-09-09 18:56:16	Klemen702	back
2015-09-09 18:56:23	Klemen702	PFFT
2015-09-09 18:56:39	Klemen702	i can't imagine how that would work :P
2015-09-09 18:57:07	Klemen702	is it on the TCRF page?
2015-09-09 18:57:40	Yoshi2	https://tcrf.net/Super_Mario_Sunshine#Unused_Multiplayer_Scene_ID
2015-09-09 18:58:27	Klemen702	ah
2015-09-09 18:58:31	Klemen702	seems like so
2015-09-09 18:58:56	Yoshi2	the camera changes in such a way that both Mario and Shadow Mario can be seen on the screen
2015-09-09 18:59:37	Yoshi2	that means Shadow Mario was likely developed from Nintendo's attempt to implement multiplayer in Sunshine

2015-09-09 19:00:09	Klemen702	in my opinion he could of been use for testing
2015-09-09 19:00:13	Klemen702	used*
2015-09-09 19:00:29	Klemen702	since he is bassicly the same model mario sorta
2015-09-09 19:01:02	UltraMario	what
2015-09-09 19:01:04	UltraMario	who is
2015-09-09 19:01:17	Klemen702	shadow mario
2015-09-09 19:01:29	Klemen702	that sunshine character 
2015-09-09 19:01:45	Yoshi2	UltraMario: https://tcrf.net/Super_Mario_Sunshine#Unused_Multiplayer_Scene_ID
2015-09-09 19:02:13	Yoshi2	there is code for making the camera keep both shadow mario and mario in the same screen
2015-09-09 19:02:17	UltraMario	oh
2015-09-09 19:02:30	UltraMario	so are we talking about sunshine beta
2015-09-09 19:02:39	Yoshi2	there is no sunshine beta q.q
2015-09-09 19:02:49	UltraMario	well you know what i mean
2015-09-09 19:02:50	UltraMario	:|
2015-09-09 19:02:52	UltraMario	cut stuff
2015-09-09 19:02:58	UltraMario	also there is probably
2015-09-09 19:03:07	UltraMario	look at delfino in the first trailer
2015-09-09 19:03:11	UltraMario	it's pretty different
2015-09-09 19:03:11	UltraMario	:P
2015-09-09 19:03:59	Yoshi2	no version of sunshine has surfaced yet that contains delfino from the first trailer
2015-09-09 19:04:11	UltraMario	exactly
2015-09-09 19:04:16	UltraMario	so that probably is a beta
2015-09-09 19:04:20	Yoshi2	ergo, there is no sunshine beta q.q
2015-09-09 19:04:25	UltraMario	but
2015-09-09 19:04:26	Yoshi2	(talking about the present)
2015-09-09 19:04:29	UltraMario	that version
2015-09-09 19:04:30	UltraMario	i mean
2015-09-09 19:04:37	UltraMario	there's no playable verson of that delfino
2015-09-09 19:04:38	UltraMario	but
2015-09-09 19:04:47	UltraMario	whether or not it is shouldnt matter :P
2015-09-09 19:05:42	Klemen702	looking at the prototype page, what is a ''gamecube kiosk demo disk'' anyways
2015-09-09 19:06:44	UltraMario	well
2015-09-09 19:06:48	UltraMario	like
2015-09-09 19:06:56	UltraMario	a demo found in a kiosk in a retailer
2015-09-09 19:06:58	UltraMario	i'd assume
2015-09-09 19:08:23	Klemen702	what is a kiosk then?
2015-09-09 19:10:10	Yoshi2	I think it's those video game system setups you see at a retailer
2015-09-09 19:10:22	Yoshi2	they usually contain special versions of games
2015-09-09 19:10:33	UltraMario	yeah
2015-09-09 19:10:42	Yoshi2	so you can't play the full game

2015-09-09 20:31:15	@Espyo	well, with the latest Dolphin, I can open the folder on the game list
2015-09-09 20:31:20	@Espyo	instead of using the File/Open option
2015-09-09 20:31:26	@Espyo	I thought that'd allow me to use cheats, at least
2015-09-09 20:31:27	@Espyo	but nope
2015-09-09 20:32:57	Klemen702	is there atleast a benefiet other than cheats?
2015-09-09 20:34:57	@Espyo	well, I can't use saves
2015-09-09 20:35:02	@Espyo	so at LEAST if I could use cheats, I could open up areas
2015-09-09 20:35:16	@Espyo	I can play the game, but having to play all over again just to reach like the Wistful Wild?
2015-09-09 20:35:22	@Espyo	at a lower framerate, with a keyboard?
2015-09-09 20:35:23	@Espyo	no way
2015-09-09 20:35:53	Klemen702	damn
2015-09-09 20:36:18	Yoshi2	Espyo: what are you playing that you can't use cheats?
2015-09-09 20:36:42	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 on Dolphin using the folder as a game
2015-09-09 20:36:44	@Espyo	instead of an ISO
2015-09-09 20:36:50	@Espyo	ISO works fine, but it's harder to mod
2015-09-09 20:37:14	Yoshi2	ah
2015-09-09 20:37:25	Yoshi2	couldn't you import the cheats?
2015-09-09 20:41:18	Yoshi2	but pretty cool that dolphin supports running the folder as a game, I should give it a try when I play around with GC files again
2015-09-09 20:42:05	@Espyo	it just doesn't support cheats for it whatsoever
2015-09-09 20:42:10	@Espyo	and as for the saves, it DOES support saves
2015-09-09 20:42:18	@Espyo	but it insists that THIS Pikmin 2 has a different game ID
2015-09-09 20:42:21	@Espyo	which ruins everything everywhere

2015-09-09 21:30:37	@J	how can it be hardcoded?
2015-09-09 21:30:45	@J	it has to get it from some information about the game
2015-09-09 21:30:54	@Espyo	for ISOs, sure
2015-09-09 21:31:00	@J	what about the game does it use to determine which ID it has?
2015-09-09 21:31:02	@Espyo	for the folder, it just assumes it's AGBJ01

2015-09-09 21:41:50	Klemen702	i remember a kid (when i was still in 8th grade, i am in 9th now btw) tried commiting suicide... but a school mate lead him to a teacher or something...
2015-09-09 21:42:32	@Espyo	that's good, at least
2015-09-09 21:44:00	Klemen702	to be more specific on the suicide, the kid was on the roof of the school...
2015-09-09 21:44:06	@Espyo	yikes

2015-09-09 21:50:26	@Espyo	well, chat's lighting up
2015-09-09 21:50:42	@Espyo	I brought up some conversation for them to say it out loud if they have suicidal tendencies
2015-09-09 21:50:47	@Espyo	then we started talking about how we like our lives
2015-09-09 21:50:55	@Espyo	sounds like an anti-depression anonymous group
2015-09-09 21:51:01	@Espyo	but it felt good
2015-09-09 21:51:08	@Espyo	I'll take the chance to say it here too, I guess
2015-09-09 21:51:13	@Espyo	if any of you have any suicidal thoughts of any kind
2015-09-09 21:51:16	@Espyo	DO talk to somebody, ASAP
2015-09-09 21:51:25	@Espyo	there's a reason people insist on you letting others know
2015-09-09 21:51:29	Klemen702	eh
2015-09-09 21:51:29	@Espyo	and it's not just saying
2015-09-09 21:51:32	Klemen702	i'm fine
2015-09-09 21:51:42	@Espyo	I know I'm darn fine, and that isn't changing
2015-09-09 21:51:55	Klemen702	but i did have an emotional trauma or something back in winter...
2015-09-09 21:53:03	@Espyo	well, if it didn't change your outlook on life, it might not really be a bad thing
2015-09-09 21:53:16	Klemen702	i got over it actually
2015-09-09 21:53:34	Klemen702	i was just sad how many horrible insults i have been getting
2015-09-09 21:53:50	Klemen702	but now i don't really care anymore
2015-09-09 21:54:16	Klemen702	jerkish people are not worth my time and life to spend on
2015-09-09 21:54:28	@Espyo	that's great
2015-09-09 21:54:34	@Espyo	eh, we all had those people in our lives
2015-09-09 21:54:41	@Espyo	no worries, as time goes by, they really do disappear
2015-09-09 21:54:50	Klemen702	yeah lol
2015-09-09 21:54:58	@Espyo	last time I've been insulted, you know, without being on the internet, was probably over 10 years ago
2015-09-09 21:55:10	@Espyo	heck, last time I had people DISLIKE me was probably over 10 years ago
2015-09-09 21:55:16	Klemen702	i'll probably never see them again once i finish this year
2015-09-09 21:55:24	@Espyo	which is always good
2015-09-09 21:57:59	Klemen702	days are getting colder it seems
2015-09-09 21:58:02	Klemen702	even now
2015-09-09 21:58:20	Klemen702	i'll have to stop wearing flip flops D:
2015-09-09 21:58:23	Klemen702	i LOVE those
2015-09-09 21:58:48	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-09-09 21:58:55	@Espyo	I like flip-flops, but I like really warm slippers too
2015-09-09 21:59:31	Klemen702	yes
2015-09-09 22:00:52	Testyo	so apparently Ludum sent the file you probably saved it as merge, not merge.py
2015-09-09 22:01:36	@Espyo	Ludum Dare? Python?

2015-09-10 13:55:42	@Espyo	wtf
2015-09-10 13:55:51	@Espyo	Dolphin has a way to search for cheats by comparing values
2015-09-10 13:55:53	@Espyo	like Cheat Engine
2015-09-10 13:56:03	@Espyo	you can compare if a value is larger than the previous search, the same, etc.
2015-09-10 13:56:08	@Espyo	in one of the latest builds of Dolphin
2015-09-10 13:56:16	@Espyo	they removed the comparison with the previous search
2015-09-10 13:56:19	@Espyo	wtf is this regression
2015-09-10 13:56:23	@Espyo	it's basically useless now
2015-09-10 14:01:34	Yoshi2	wat
2015-09-10 14:01:38	Yoshi2	really?
2015-09-10 14:02:22	@Espyo	yeah
2015-09-10 14:02:29	@Espyo	good thing I still have an old version lying aroun
2015-09-10 14:02:30	@Espyo	*d
2015-09-10 14:03:10	Yoshi2	so you cannot set whether you are looking for a value smaller/bigger/equal to X anymore?
2015-09-10 14:04:07	Yoshi2	which version of dolphin is it? I can't believe anybody thought removing that would be a good idea
2015-09-10 14:05:31	@Espyo	you can search a value larger, smaller or equal to a SPECIFIC number
2015-09-10 14:05:34	@Espyo	but not the previous one
2015-09-10 14:05:42	@Espyo	-1997 has a previous-value search
2015-09-10 14:06:03	@Espyo	-7636 doesn't
2015-09-10 14:06:41	Yoshi2	huh, I don't quite understand that
2015-09-10 14:06:51	Yoshi2	what keeps you from repeating the number you searched for previously?
2015-09-10 14:06:57	@Espyo	simple
2015-09-10 14:07:01	@Espyo	what if I don't know the initial value?
2015-09-10 14:07:32	@Espyo	like the coordinates, which is what I'm actually trying to get
2015-09-10 14:07:45	@Espyo	you start unknown, then move forward, check for a value increase in comparison to the previous
2015-09-10 14:07:50	@Espyo	then forward, increased, then try backwards, decreased
2015-09-10 14:08:02	@Espyo	and it works with any memory searching thing out there, as long as you can compare to the previous value
2015-09-10 14:09:03	Yoshi2	ah, so the thing you need is a feature that lists all values that increased or decreased since the last search?

2015-09-10 14:29:59	Yoshi2	I wonder why dolphin axed it
2015-09-10 14:30:09	Yoshi2	considering that it's open source, there must be a commit somewhere

2015-09-11 19:15:04	@Espyo	I tried searching for the address that has the coordinates and the vertical speed
2015-09-11 19:15:07	@Espyo	I can't find anything

2015-09-11 19:15:17	@Espyo	decrease? nothing

2015-09-11 19:40:08	@Espyo	J made a tool to change the files inside an ISO
2015-09-11 19:40:15	@Espyo	other tools have stupid size limits, his doesn't

2015-09-11 19:40:54	@Espyo	it was crashing because this irrelevant Action Replay code was on

2015-09-11 19:48:36	@Espyo	I can only do two things to it
2015-09-11 19:48:51	@Espyo	or leave it alone, or change its value to ANYTHING, which will lock Olimar's Z to a certain position
2015-09-11 19:48:57	@Espyo	but I can't really change it to anything else
2015-09-11 19:50:52	@Espyo	except FF as the first byte, that'll crash

2015-09-11 21:43:28	@Espyo	the main reason I made one for the games is a) they're the games; they're probably the most linked pages on the wiki
2015-09-11 21:43:40	@Espyo	and b) typing ''[[Pikmin (game)|Pikmin]]'' every single time drives a person mad

2015-09-11 21:45:24	@J	nice job Testyo
2015-09-11 21:45:25	Testyo	I could probably hack it and do like sys.argv[1][:-3] + ".rarc", right?

2015-09-11 21:46:38	Testyo	are there are going to be three different objects

2015-09-11 21:47:06	@Espyo	just looks like one
2015-09-11 21:47:17	@Espyo	HexChat doesn't render any smiley
2015-09-11 21:47:20	@Espyo	not even sure if it CAN
2015-09-11 21:50:54	Chiaki_Nanami	oh
2015-09-11 21:50:56	Yoshi3	hexchat can render those crappy emoji smileys if you use a font that supports them

2015-09-11 21:51:10	Chiaki_Nanami	ChatZilla can render smileys

2015-09-13 20:06:45	@Espyo	so the normal for the game is for you to have the upgrade
2015-09-13 20:06:58	@Espyo	so technically, you don't receive half damage with the upgrade, you receive normal damage with it, and DOUBLE DAMAGE without

2015-09-13 20:17:48	@Espyo	don't worry about it
2015-09-13 20:17:51	@Espyo	if it happens a lot, then worry
2015-09-13 20:17:51	Klemen702	ah okay

2015-09-13 21:19:49	@Espyo	I...
2015-09-13 21:20:06	@Espyo	I think the game saves the HP value as logarithmic
2015-09-13 21:20:08	@Espyo	like
2015-09-13 21:20:15	@Espyo	 00001000 is just a tiny sliver of health
2015-09-13 21:20:20	@Espyo	 00002000 is still also a tiny sliver
2015-09-13 21:20:29	@Espyo	 00004000 is a bit noticeable, but still only a bit of health left
2015-09-13 21:20:32	@Espyo	 00005000 is full health
2015-09-13 21:22:27	En_Passant	So... did they do anything in this game correctly?
2015-09-13 21:23:23	@Espyo	I doubt it

2015-09-13 21:59:55	@Espyo	I just nope'd the hell out of there
2015-09-13 22:00:02	@Espyo	I have the info I need, which is how damaging each enemy is
2015-09-13 22:00:13	@Espyo	as for what actual number the leader's HP is, that can probably wait until we become wizards
2015-09-13 22:00:19	@Espyo	but for now, I don't even want to see it again
2015-09-13 22:13:50	Chiaki_Nanami	espyo, why is pikmin 2 so ... pikmin 2
2015-09-13 22:15:40	@Espyo	because Nintendo
2015-09-13 22:18:57	Chiaki_Nanami	indeed so

2015-09-14 23:10:13	ScruffyChat	Like, it says that the nickname "Scruffy" is already in use; should I register my name?
2015-09-14 23:10:54	UltraMarioMaker	well
2015-09-14 23:11:08	UltraMarioMaker	that means someone on irc is using that nickname at the moment
2015-09-14 23:12:50	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-09-14 23:16:29	@J	yeah, the actual server is pretty big and shared between lots of different communities, so your name might already be taken
2015-09-14 23:16:35	@J	it's separate from your wiki account(s)
2015-09-14 23:16:52	ScruffyChat	that makes sense
2015-09-14 23:17:02	ScruffyChat	Well ScruffyChat is fine with me then
2015-09-14 23:17:33	@J	you can register your account to make sure no-one else can use your name, but it's optional

2015-09-16 22:47:56	@PikFan	I just now came up with one: Melodic Meadow
2015-09-16 22:48:17	En_Passant	But what's melodic about it?
2015-09-16 22:48:21	@PikFan	I'm not too sure about "melodic", because I can't see how a grassland—exactly
2015-09-16 22:48:41	@PikFan	it just sounded interesting, so I'd thought I'd ask
2015-09-16 22:48:49	@PikFan	if not, I can come up with another adjective

2015-09-16 22:51:40	@PikFan	okay
2015-09-16 22:51:54	@PikFan	the meadow's going to be one of the last areas though
2015-09-16 22:52:07	@PikFan	so it'll probably be a harder area

2015-09-16 22:56:33	ScruffyChat	Of course a melody doesn't have to be pleasant
2015-09-16 22:56:48	@PikFan	right
2015-09-16 22:56:53	ScruffyChat	But the word itself is associated with a pleasant-sounding instrument or voice
2015-09-16 22:57:13	ScruffyChat	So if you were to name it Melodic Meadow, it sounds to me like it would be a very idyllic place
2015-09-16 22:57:24	ScruffyChat	If that's what you're going for
2015-09-16 22:57:33	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I initially had in mind
2015-09-16 22:57:41	ScruffyChat	Oh, cool
2015-09-16 22:57:51	@PikFan	then I remembered that it was going to be one of the last areas
2015-09-16 22:58:01	ScruffyChat	Well, then it could be ironic
2015-09-16 22:58:10	@PikFan	I mean, if I moved it to one of the first areas, it would make sense
2015-09-16 22:58:15	ScruffyChat	Like how the Final Trial has ironically happy music
2015-09-16 22:58:28	@PikFan	if anything it sounds like a creepy circus
2015-09-16 22:58:40	@PikFan	so does the rain version of the Formidable Oak
2015-09-16 22:59:06	@PikFan	er, wait, I meant the sunset rain version
2015-09-16 22:59:22	@PikFan	normal rain version sounds creepy too
2015-09-16 22:59:25	@PikFan	uh, anyway...
2015-09-16 22:59:27	ScruffyChat	It does
2015-09-16 22:59:40	@PikFan	but yeah, now I'm looking for other adjectives
2015-09-16 22:59:46	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-09-16 23:00:18	@PikFan	thanks for the input, it's much appreciated
2015-09-16 23:00:23	ScruffyChat	No problem!
2015-09-16 23:00:32	@PikFan	also I cannot thank you enough for rendering that Cyan Pikmin for me
2015-09-16 23:00:47	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, no sweat. I love rendering hair
2015-09-16 23:00:53	@PikFan	I hoped it wasn't too challenging—ah
2015-09-16 23:01:08	@PikFan	yeah, I just thought it might be harder since you'd have to render each strand of hair
2015-09-16 23:01:22	ScruffyChat	My computer can handle it pretty quickly
2015-09-16 23:01:34	@PikFan	I see, good to know
2015-09-16 23:01:40	ScruffyChat	Because once it gets to the rendering its rendering per-pixel, not per-hair
2015-09-16 23:01:50	@PikFan	mm
2015-09-16 23:02:16	@PikFan	oh, and I like the Glade of Daylight area preview
2015-09-16 23:02:23	ScruffyChat	Oh, thank you!
2015-09-16 23:02:30	@PikFan	are you making area previews in a similar vein to P1 and P3?
2015-09-16 23:02:36	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-09-16 23:02:41	@PikFan	ah
2015-09-16 23:02:48	ScruffyChat	And I also thought I could do that for the caves as well
2015-09-16 23:02:51	@PikFan	keep it up, I'm enjoying all the new content
2015-09-16 23:02:53	@PikFan	oooh
2015-09-16 23:02:58	@PikFan	good idea
2015-09-16 23:03:00	ScruffyChat	Thanks!
2015-09-16 23:03:18	@PikFan	I need to get around to detailing my caves
2015-09-16 23:03:38	@PikFan	90% of them don't even have a page yet...
2015-09-16 23:03:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it's a lot of thinking
2015-09-16 23:04:03	@PikFan	indeed
2015-09-16 23:04:03	ScruffyChat	Because you need to know the location of everything
2015-09-16 23:04:09	@PikFan	right
2015-09-16 23:04:32	ScruffyChat	Well I admire your game, I look forward to all your cave ideas
2015-09-16 23:04:38	@PikFan	thanks!
2015-09-16 23:04:53	@PikFan	I'm preparing it for a major overhaul
2015-09-16 23:05:04	ScruffyChat	Also to Espyo, whenever you're back, I need En_Passant as well
2015-09-16 23:05:16	ScruffyChat	I was thinking we could set up a three-way chat
2015-09-16 23:05:34	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-16 23:06:41	@PikFan	regarding my game: I created most of it back when I was 11-12, so I made it in a way that, if it was actually developed and published, would have a horrid progression
2015-09-16 23:07:01	@PikFan	now I'm 15 and I'm realizing how game design works, and I see how flawed the progression is in my game
2015-09-16 23:07:04	En_Passant	@PikFan, I'm doing a project IRL which requires expert advisors, so I asked them because they have experience in things that are relevant to it
2015-09-16 23:07:26	En_Passant	We're exchanging real world information, which is why it's private
2015-09-16 23:07:37	@PikFan	@En_Passant: oh, okay
2015-09-16 23:07:40	@PikFan	makes sense
2015-09-16 23:08:51	@Espyo	oh, sure
2015-09-16 23:08:57	@Espyo	three-way chat sounds nice
2015-09-16 23:09:25	@PikFan	there's a way to make a channel private, but I can't remember what it is
2015-09-16 23:09:49	@PikFan	you can even give channels passwords
2015-09-16 23:10:06	@Espyo	no need, we can just give each other the room's name in private
2015-09-16 23:10:15	@Espyo	guess I'll make it
2015-09-16 23:10:26	@Espyo	uhm, or not?
2015-09-16 23:10:33	@Espyo	looks like we can't create our own channels here
2015-09-16 23:10:37	@Espyo	...that doesn't make sense
2015-09-16 23:10:42	@PikFan	huh?
2015-09-16 23:11:29	@PikFan	I'll leave you to your own devices
2015-09-16 23:16:19	@PikFan	gonna have to go soon, my bus is going to be here in 5-10 minutes
2015-09-16 23:16:44	@Espyo	all right
2015-09-16 23:17:13	@PikFan	probably be on later, but by then you'll be asleep
2015-09-16 23:17:49	@Espyo	yeah
2015-09-16 23:18:16	@PikFan	oh, how's this sound? Menacing Meadow
2015-09-16 23:18:30	@PikFan	sounds ominous enough, and it's kind of an oxymoron, too
2015-09-16 23:21:04	ScruffyChat	It's getting there, for sure
2015-09-16 23:21:32	@PikFan	how could it be improved?
2015-09-16 23:22:48	@PikFan	actually, tell me when I get home; I'll be home in about a half hour
2015-09-16 23:23:09	@PikFan	night Espyo, see you in a bit maybe, En_Passant and Scruffy

2015-09-17 00:10:48	ScruffyChat	I get all my non-original models from the website Models Resource. It's pretty extensive, but the official Pikmin models are slim pickings (or "pik-ings" :D) at the moment. That's his model from Brawl, complete with skeleton.

2015-09-17 01:27:47	ScruffyChat	But this should be the Glade of Daylight, slowly revealed bit by bit
2015-09-17 01:28:17	ScruffyChat	I love huge areas like P3 had, but I thought it'd be more epic if they were all one big chunk of terrain
2015-09-17 01:28:31	@PikFan	hmm... maybe the big square near the middle?
2015-09-17 01:29:34	@PikFan	and yeah, I agree with the one area thing
2015-09-17 01:30:00	@PikFan	like, subareas exist, but they're not really separated from each other like in P3
2015-09-17 01:30:10	@PikFan	more like borders on the map

2015-09-17 02:14:03	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-17 02:14:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah I've found that with enemies, sometimes instead of making new ones you find you can give abilities to other ones
2015-09-17 02:20:43	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-17 02:20:57	@PikFan	my enemies are so unoriginal
2015-09-17 02:27:14	ScruffyChat	It's so tough
2015-09-17 02:27:24	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-17 02:27:37	@PikFan	I can't be bothered to come up with original names
2015-09-17 02:27:45	@PikFan	I'm horrible with original names
2015-09-17 02:27:51	ScruffyChat	I'll tell you, the way I go about it is thinking about a specific animal trait, like the anteater's tongue, and working specifically off of that
2015-09-17 02:28:07	ScruffyChat	Then I look up some weird animals to get an idea for how it should look
2015-09-17 02:28:20	ScruffyChat	But only weird animals in its phylum
2015-09-17 02:28:33	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-09-17 02:28:48	@PikFan	I'd like to know Nintendo's secret to game design
2015-09-17 02:29:08	ScruffyChat	Oh! Well there is a secret they have to level design at least
2015-09-17 02:29:39	@PikFan	ah, interesting
2015-09-17 02:29:59	@PikFan	well, I really hope that P4 is bigger than P3
2015-09-17 02:30:03	@PikFan	it HAS to be
2015-09-17 02:30:20	@PikFan	at least 6 or 7 areas...

2015-09-18 21:36:17	@Espyo	I'm glad we got to the point where we can make picky articles like Loading
2015-09-18 21:36:20	@Espyo	oh, speak of the devil
2015-09-18 21:36:21	@Espyo	high
2015-09-18 21:36:23	@Espyo	...
2015-09-18 21:36:25	@Espyo	did I just
2015-09-18 21:36:29	@Espyo	type "high" instead of "hi"
2015-09-18 21:36:39	@Espyo	I meant hi, dammit
2015-09-18 21:36:39	ScruffyChat	Haha hi
2015-09-18 21:36:48	ScruffyChat	It's cool
2015-09-18 21:36:49	@Espyo	hey, to my defence, I'm all hunched over, focusing more on balancing
2015-09-18 21:36:50	@Espyo	*shrug*
2015-09-18 21:36:56	@Espyo	anyway, how are you?
2015-09-18 21:37:16	ScruffyChat	Good, I just made a little update for the effects in the loading screens
2015-09-18 21:37:51	ScruffyChat	Should we have an article for that screen that tells you to look at the TV or Gamepad with random Pikmin or the S.S. Drake moving in the background?
2015-09-18 21:37:57	ScruffyChat	Or not an article
2015-09-18 21:38:07	ScruffyChat	Just, should we put that somewhere?
2015-09-18 21:41:10	@Espyo	yeah, probably [[Menu]]
2015-09-18 21:41:10	Testyo	"Menu" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Menu

2015-09-18 21:41:26	@Espyo	hm, we should rename it to something like Screen, one of these days
2015-09-18 21:41:29	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-09-18 21:42:45	ScruffyChat	Oh also, I think pretty soon I'm going to upload my arrangements of Pikmin tracks to YouTube
2015-09-18 21:43:09	ScruffyChat	I think it'll be fine, it seems pretty difficult for Nintendo to harass something like that
2015-09-18 21:43:49	@Espyo	nice
2015-09-18 21:43:56	@Espyo	they might, it's what they do
2015-09-18 21:44:02	@Espyo	but they don't target the "small" people
2015-09-18 21:45:09	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-18 21:45:23	ScruffyChat	I suppose as long as I don't specifically advertise it
2015-09-18 21:45:30	ScruffyChat	Which I wasn't planning to anyway
2015-09-18 21:46:58	ScruffyChat	I've gotten it very true to the original compositions
2015-09-18 21:47:07	ScruffyChat	It's almost like remastering

2015-09-20 22:15:06	@PikFan	ah, if only Scruffy and En Passant were here
2015-09-20 22:20:53	UltraMario	rip pikfan
2015-09-20 22:20:55	UltraMario	:P

2015-09-20 22:53:39	@PikFan	question, is 27 caves too many caves for a Pikmin game?
2015-09-20 22:54:14	@J	depends how big they are, and if they each offer something different
2015-09-20 22:54:34	@PikFan	they're not going to be randomized like in P2
2015-09-20 22:54:43	@J	also how much other game there is
2015-09-20 22:54:56	UltraMario	pikfan
2015-09-20 22:55:00	UltraMario	are you thinking of getting SMM?
2015-09-20 22:55:00	UltraMario	:O
2015-09-20 22:55:14	@PikFan	Christmas
2015-09-20 22:55:25	@PikFan	anyway, I didn't understand that last bit, J
2015-09-20 22:55:27	UltraMario	o
2015-09-20 22:55:29	UltraMario	cool
2015-09-20 22:55:34	UltraMario	think you would play my levels? :>
2015-09-20 22:55:45	@PikFan	maybe
2015-09-20 22:55:52	UltraMario	they're remakes of obscure mario levels
2015-09-20 22:55:54	UltraMario	:D
2015-09-20 22:56:02	@PikFan	I know
2015-09-20 22:56:37	@PikFan	Espyo?
2015-09-20 22:56:54	@J	if most of the game is caves, or only some of it
2015-09-20 22:56:56	UltraMario	o
2015-09-20 22:57:08	@J	if the focus isn't actually caves, then it sounds like a lot
2015-09-20 22:57:18	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-09-20 22:57:32	@PikFan	there's 9 areas total, and they're going to be pretty big
2015-09-20 22:57:54	@PikFan	bigger than P3 areas
2015-09-20 22:58:00	Testyo	very bathroom)
2015-09-20 22:58:06	@PikFan	and only 3 caves per area, so it should balance out
2015-09-20 22:58:51	@Espyo	hmmm?
2015-09-20 22:59:05	@PikFan	14:53	PikFan	question, is 27 caves too many caves for a Pikmin game?
2015-09-20 22:59:19	@Espyo	what J said
2015-09-20 22:59:30	@Espyo	also depends on the theming of the game
2015-09-20 22:59:35	@Espyo	is it meant to be cave-centric?
2015-09-20 22:59:42	@J	well, it sounds quite big
2015-09-20 22:59:46	@J	like, LoZ-big
2015-09-20 22:59:58	@PikFan	yeah, that's kinda what I'm aiming for
2015-09-20 23:00:08	@J	for me, that's probably too long, but certainly lots of people like it
2015-09-20 23:00:09	UltraMario	big as ridley?
2015-09-20 23:00:10	UltraMario	;)
2015-09-20 23:00:23	UltraMario	*shot*
2015-09-20 23:00:40	@J	TBH, I prefer a game with a short initial length but lots of depth
2015-09-20 23:00:52	@J	then I can play more games, and invest more time in the best ones
2015-09-20 23:01:01	@PikFan	hm
2015-09-20 23:01:13	@J	even 5-hour games
2015-09-20 23:01:39	UltraMario	so like luigi's mansion?
2015-09-20 23:01:40	UltraMario	:P
2015-09-20 23:01:49	@PikFan	I like games that are long, because I think it makes you want to come back for more
2015-09-20 23:02:03	UltraMario	true
2015-09-20 23:02:11	@PikFan	Espyo: no, not necessarily
2015-09-20 23:02:22	@PikFan	it's centered around exploration
2015-09-20 23:02:22	@J	Luigi's Mansion is a pretty good length, yeah
2015-09-20 23:02:43	UltraMario	i thought it was rather short :p
2015-09-20 23:02:45	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2015-09-20 23:02:53	UltraMario	Wario World?
2015-09-20 23:02:54	@J	exactly
2015-09-20 23:02:58	@J	I never played that
2015-09-20 23:03:01	UltraMario	i know some poeple complained that gae was pretty short
2015-09-20 23:03:20	UltraMario	they probably didnt even get every treasure
2015-09-20 23:03:20	UltraMario	;P
2015-09-20 23:04:16	@J	well, a game that's very long can be more rewarding, but most game concepts aren't really deep enough to stretch out for long enough
2015-09-20 23:04:39	UltraMario	depends on the game
2015-09-20 23:04:40	UltraMario	;p
2015-09-20 23:04:40	@J	you need mechanics that stop feeling the same, otherwise it's essentially same content
2015-09-20 23:04:53	@J	in which case you can just repeat a shorter game
2015-09-20 23:05:12	@J	yeah, sure, some games exist to show off a story or a world instead of gameplay
2015-09-20 23:05:21	UltraMario	rpgs
2015-09-20 23:05:30	UltraMario	those shouldnt typically be short :P
2015-09-20 23:05:32	@J	but they still need some game mechanics to be games
2015-09-20 23:06:08	@J	RPGs introduce depth through huge numbers of items and mechanics
2015-09-20 23:06:11	@PikFan	so you mean, new features/abilities added later on to keep it interesting?
2015-09-20 23:06:14	@J	sometimes it even works
2015-09-20 23:06:43	@J	PikFan: yeah, but I'd rather design a game thinking of it the other way around
2015-09-20 23:06:55	@J	instead of deciding the length and then making mechanics to fit that length
2015-09-20 23:07:08	@J	come up with good mechanics then design the levels to fit what you have
2015-09-20 23:07:20	UltraMario	hi guys
2015-09-20 23:07:27	UltraMario	want me to show you my puppy?
2015-09-20 23:07:27	UltraMario	:>
2015-09-20 23:07:34	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-09-20 23:07:40	UltraMario	HE'S CUTE
2015-09-20 23:07:41	UltraMario	<3
2015-09-20 23:07:54	UltraMario	his name is Puppy
2015-09-20 23:07:55	UltraMario	:3
2015-09-20 23:08:12	@J	it's certainly a name
2015-09-20 23:08:25	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-20 23:09:10	@PikFan	other than new Pikmin types being introduced (each with their own abilities) and upgrades, I don't know what "good mechanics" would entail
2015-09-20 23:09:13	UltraMario	should i get you a picture?
2015-09-20 23:09:13	UltraMario	:
2015-09-20 23:09:13	UltraMario	P
2015-09-20 23:09:15	UltraMario	:P
2015-09-20 23:11:27	@PikFan	maybe I'm just not cut out for making a good game
2015-09-20 23:12:24	@J	I'm sure anyone can make a good game
2015-09-20 23:13:09	@PikFan	also: area names http://pastebin.com/mwTYiwFb
2015-09-20 23:13:12	@J	and everyone's idea of a good game is different anyway
2015-09-20 23:13:22	@PikFan	true
2015-09-20 23:13:24	UltraMario	awww
2015-09-20 23:13:27	UltraMario	pikfan dont say that
2015-09-20 23:13:27	UltraMario	<3
2015-09-20 23:13:32	UltraMario	DONT LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS
2015-09-20 23:13:34	UltraMario	JUST DO IT
2015-09-20 23:13:40	UltraMario	;)
2015-09-20 23:13:56	@PikFan	well, part of this stems from that I was disappointed by the length of Pikmin 3
2015-09-20 23:14:01	@PikFan	of which there wasn't much
2015-09-20 23:14:23	UltraMario	well
2015-09-20 23:14:31	UltraMario	there's always the recently announced pikmin 4
2015-09-20 23:14:32	UltraMario	;)
2015-09-20 23:14:53	@J	yeah, it just takes time to make good content
2015-09-20 23:14:55	@J	a lot of time
2015-09-20 23:15:31	UltraMario	true
2015-09-20 23:15:38	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-09-20 23:16:19	@J	those area names are pretty good
2015-09-20 23:17:04	@PikFan	oh, good
2015-09-20 23:17:16	UltraMario	so, does anyone wanna see my puppy? :p
2015-09-20 23:17:41	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-09-20 23:17:44	@J	I'm not sure about 'distant desert'
2015-09-20 23:17:56	@J	I'm trying to work out what about it could be distant if you're there
2015-09-20 23:17:58	UltraMario	guessing you're not a dog person, pikfan? ;p
2015-09-20 23:17:58	@PikFan	yeah, I had qualms about that
2015-09-20 23:18:02	@J	'whispering' is very nice
2015-09-20 23:18:02	UltraMario	you seem kinda reluctant
2015-09-20 23:18:38	@PikFan	thanks
2015-09-20 23:19:26	@J	anyway, I should get some sleep
2015-09-20 23:19:30	@J	goodnight
2015-09-20 23:19:34	@PikFan	night
2015-09-20 23:19:38	@PikFan	thanks for your input
2015-09-20 23:19:41	@J	no problem
2015-09-20 23:22:42	UltraMario	pikfan are you not much of a dog person?
2015-09-20 23:22:43	UltraMario	:p
2015-09-20 23:26:26	@Espyo	sleep here too
2015-09-20 23:26:29	@Espyo	kind of ill

2015-09-21 22:48:42	@PikFan	hi
2015-09-21 22:49:22	@Espyo	hi
2015-09-21 22:49:45	@PikFan	ok so

2015-09-21 22:50:07	@PikFan	if you ask me, "Transcript" doesn't seem like the right word
2015-09-21 22:51:18	@PikFan	like, "transcript" means "written or printed version of material originally presented in another medium"
2015-09-21 22:51:34	@PikFan	but when I think of "transcript", I think of like... a script
2015-09-21 22:51:37	@PikFan	with lines and such
2015-09-21 22:51:54	@PikFan	imo, a better word would be "synopsis"
2015-09-21 22:51:54	@Espyo	I get you
2015-09-21 22:51:58	@Espyo	you sure?
2015-09-21 22:52:04	@Espyo	we discussed this on skype at one point
2015-09-21 22:52:06	@Espyo	can't remember the conclusion
2015-09-21 22:52:09	@Espyo	if we even reached any
2015-09-21 22:52:32	@PikFan	synopsis: a brief summary or general survey of something
2015-09-21 22:52:37	@PikFan	according to google
2015-09-21 22:52:58	@PikFan	even though these summaries aren't brief, but it still seems fitting
2015-09-21 22:53:33	@Espyo	I suppose so
2015-09-21 22:53:34	@Espyo	go ahead
2015-09-21 22:53:42	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2015-09-21 22:54:18	@PikFan	also, isn't there an image somewhere with a closeup of Olimar and a lot of Pikmin behind him?

2015-09-21 23:17:27	@Espyo	sweet
2015-09-21 23:17:59	@Espyo	and now we wait for Nintendo to shut down the video
2015-09-21 23:18:09	ScruffyChat	Sure, what's up?
2015-09-21 23:18:30	ScruffyChat	That string section is sweet
2015-09-21 23:19:12	@PikFan	okay, I only have a few minutes, but
2015-09-21 23:19:23	@PikFan	is 25-ish caves too many caves for a Pikmin game?
2015-09-21 23:20:01	UltraMario	PikFan: inb4 this meets the same fate as the SM64 HD Remake
2015-09-21 23:20:01	UltraMario	:P
2015-09-21 23:20:09	@PikFan	I had this discussion yesterday with J, and he said only if it isn't centered around caves
2015-09-21 23:20:16	@PikFan	but I want to know what you think, too
2015-09-21 23:20:37	UltraMario	me?
2015-09-21 23:20:42	@PikFan	Scruffy
2015-09-21 23:20:50	UltraMario	o
2015-09-21 23:21:27	ScruffyChat	I say 25-ish caves is fine, as long as you can have a nice progression of difficulty and introduce something new in every cave
2015-09-21 23:21:40	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2015-09-21 23:21:59	@PikFan	yeah, each cave won't be randomized like P2, so there's that
2015-09-21 23:22:41	@PikFan	I'm just trying to balance the number of caves and areas
2015-09-21 23:22:42	ScruffyChat	That sounds great
2015-09-21 23:22:45	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-21 23:22:59	@PikFan	I decided to axe the Great Volcano, so I've now got 8 areas
2015-09-21 23:23:04	@PikFan	so about 3 caves per area
2015-09-21 23:23:10	@PikFan	but still, it seems like a lot
2015-09-21 23:23:20	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, 3 caves an area plus an extra is fine
2015-09-21 23:23:38	@PikFan	hence the 25-ish
2015-09-21 23:23:42	ScruffyChat	Not every cave has to be as long as the progression in P2
2015-09-21 23:24:01	ScruffyChat	You could have some caves that are really short but that are one hard challenge
2015-09-21 23:24:02	@Espyo	going to bed now
2015-09-21 23:24:06	@Espyo	still have a cold, but I should be good tomorrow

2015-09-21 23:25:05	@PikFan	that way some caves won't end up being a sprint AND a marathon
2015-09-21 23:25:20	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-09-21 23:25:26	@PikFan	case in point: the Chasm of Challenges

2015-09-22 00:45:24	@PikFan	I had to wait for my mom to get home so she could turn on the computer, then I got distracted with stuff
2015-09-22 00:45:41	ScruffyChat	So remind me how the Chasm of Challenges works
2015-09-22 00:45:45	@PikFan	ah, right
2015-09-22 00:45:46	ScruffyChat	Or wait I can just look it up
2015-09-22 00:46:02	@PikFan	it's just a 100 floor cave, basically
2015-09-22 00:47:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-22 00:47:06	@PikFan	at the end of it are Ultima Pikmin, the most powerful Pikmin type in the game
2015-09-22 00:47:53	@PikFan	but yeah, I was inspired by the Pit of 100 Trials page
2015-09-22 00:48:02	ScruffyChat	But you have to go through it at least twice to get them?
2015-09-22 00:48:14	@PikFan	I need to change that, yeah
2015-09-22 00:48:17	@PikFan	bit unfair
2015-09-22 00:48:30	ScruffyChat	Haha just a little
2015-09-22 00:48:41	ScruffyChat	Maybe getting Ultima Pikmin on the first go 
2015-09-22 00:48:46	@PikFan	right, right
2015-09-22 00:48:52	ScruffyChat	And then there's a second prize to going again, once you have them
2015-09-22 00:49:06	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 00:49:43	@PikFan	there's a treasure called the Universal Equilibrium, which unlocks different game modes
2015-09-22 00:50:04	UltraMario	does anyone here have Windows 10?
2015-09-22 00:50:06	@PikFan	in Normal difficulty it unlocks the Cave Creator
2015-09-22 00:50:25	@PikFan	in Hard difficulty it unlocks the Pikmin: Impact Gameplay Trial

2015-09-22 00:51:22	UltraMario	no? :P
2015-09-22 00:51:31	@PikFan	ugh, I need to get around to working on Pikmin: Impact
2015-09-22 00:51:52	@PikFan	it would be a nice change from PCW, yes
2015-09-22 00:52:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah! What is it about?
2015-09-22 00:52:10	@PikFan	ok so
2015-09-22 00:52:29	@PikFan	after PCW and the whole crisis is fixed, an asteroid is spotted
2015-09-22 00:52:39	@PikFan	a very large asteroid
2015-09-22 00:52:51	@PikFan	and it's headed right for PNF-404
2015-09-22 00:53:20	@PikFan	so the Hocotatians have to assemble a device that can divert the asteroid
2015-09-22 00:53:34	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-09-22 00:53:47	@PikFan	originally I wanted the asteroid to explode (because yay explosions), but I realized that would actually be more harmful
2015-09-22 00:54:47	ScruffyChat	Well, in the atmosphere it could burn up significantly and even explode without doing too much harm
2015-09-22 00:55:05	ScruffyChat	Would you be assembling the device while the asteroid approaches?
2015-09-22 00:55:19	@PikFan	right, but this asteroid's about the size of the one that impacted 65 million years ago
2015-09-22 00:55:25	@PikFan	and yeah
2015-09-22 00:55:30	@PikFan	so there'd be a time limit
2015-09-22 00:55:44	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-09-22 00:56:07	ScruffyChat	Did you think of that from Majora's Mask... possibly?
2015-09-22 00:56:18	@PikFan	nope
2015-09-22 00:56:48	ScruffyChat	Ok, never mind
2015-09-22 00:56:50	@PikFan	though now you mention it, I originally wanted the moon to crash into PNF-404
2015-09-22 00:56:59	ScruffyChat	Oooh, I wouldn't go there
2015-09-22 00:57:02	ScruffyChat	That's a lot worse
2015-09-22 00:57:04	@PikFan	that was ages ago, and I realized that was impractical
2015-09-22 00:57:08	ScruffyChat	And a lot harder to prevent
2015-09-22 00:57:12	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 00:57:35	@PikFan	how would you even deorbit the moon such that it would crash
2015-09-22 00:57:51	ScruffyChat	But with an asteroid, diverting it can be as simple as shooting something into space that can collide with it at the right trajectory
2015-09-22 00:57:51	@PikFan	...these are relics from a preteen mind attempting game design
2015-09-22 00:58:06	@PikFan	hm, true
2015-09-22 00:58:16	ScruffyChat	Come to think of it, the S.S. Dolphin might have saved the planet, who knows if that asteroid were headed down
2015-09-22 00:58:32	@PikFan	possibly
2015-09-22 00:58:43	@PikFan	though based on its size, it probably would have burned up anyway
2015-09-22 00:58:48	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-22 00:58:58	ScruffyChat	Right haha I forgot scale
2015-09-22 00:58:59	@PikFan	it wasn't that much bigger than the Dolphin, iirc
2015-09-22 00:59:05	ScruffyChat	It's like a baseball
2015-09-22 00:59:10	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 00:59:36	@PikFan	hm, there's always some sort of crash landing at the beginning of each Pikmin game...
2015-09-22 00:59:47	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-09-22 00:59:52	ScruffyChat	You can never land there correctly
2015-09-22 01:00:11	@PikFan	did you keep that going with the intro of Pikmin Forever?
2015-09-22 01:00:22	ScruffyChat	Yes, there are actually two crash landings
2015-09-22 01:00:34	ScruffyChat	One by the KHA Lander (not seen) and one by Olimar (seen)
2015-09-22 01:00:45	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:01:13	@PikFan	although, I don't understand why the ships couldn't move out of the Onions' way
2015-09-22 01:01:27	ScruffyChat	Well...
2015-09-22 01:01:30	ScruffyChat	umm...
2015-09-22 01:01:36	ScruffyChat	It's kinda...
2015-09-22 01:01:39	ScruffyChat	secret for the moment
2015-09-22 01:01:56	ScruffyChat	I don't really know how to explain
2015-09-22 01:02:02	ScruffyChat	well, I might as well say
2015-09-22 01:02:16	@PikFan	were they... allured?
2015-09-22 01:02:19	ScruffyChat	The secret project I've been working on is a rendered prologue to Pikmin Forever
2015-09-22 01:02:30	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-09-22 01:02:38	ScruffyChat	Complete with sound, post-processing, music, and voice acting done by me
2015-09-22 01:02:45	@PikFan	wow!
2015-09-22 01:02:52	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-09-22 01:03:01	@PikFan	but hush now
2015-09-22 01:03:09	@PikFan	I don't want the surprise ruined
2015-09-22 01:03:14	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-09-22 01:03:31	@PikFan	anyway, yeah
2015-09-22 01:04:02	@PikFan	so, uh...
2015-09-22 01:04:11	@PikFan	before I left we were talking about caves
2015-09-22 01:04:15	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-22 01:04:21	ScruffyChat	And I think 25 is a fine number
2015-09-22 01:04:28	ScruffyChat	is the Chasm of Challenges one of them>
2015-09-22 01:04:43	@PikFan	now that you mention it... yes
2015-09-22 01:04:56	@PikFan	in the main story, there would only be 24
2015-09-22 01:05:08	ScruffyChat	That sounds good
2015-09-22 01:05:18	@PikFan	after the final boss, several new caves open up, and the Chasm of Challenges is one of them
2015-09-22 01:05:41	@PikFan	I don't like the idea that there's nothing else to do after the final boss
2015-09-22 01:05:42	ScruffyChat	Oh wow, so the final boss is not the end
2015-09-22 01:05:45	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-22 01:05:46	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-22 01:05:59	@PikFan	I want there to be a post-story, so to speak
2015-09-22 01:06:01	ScruffyChat	That's a problem with my game, I don't know what to do after the final boss
2015-09-22 01:06:13	ScruffyChat	Unless I were to make a sequel
2015-09-22 01:06:31	ScruffyChat	But then again, the vibe set at the end of the game is that they aren't coming back to PNF-404
2015-09-22 01:06:37	@PikFan	the way that you ended it, though, I can't see how there—yeah
2015-09-22 01:07:00	ScruffyChat	Of course I don't want the series to have an end
2015-09-22 01:07:08	ScruffyChat	But I can't think of a way around that yet
2015-09-22 01:07:24	@PikFan	maybe...
2015-09-22 01:07:31	@PikFan	this is a radical idea, but
2015-09-22 01:07:41	@PikFan	what if you could play as a Pikmin?
2015-09-22 01:08:02	ScruffyChat	After my game? Or yours?
2015-09-22 01:08:06	@PikFan	after yours
2015-09-22 01:08:15	ScruffyChat	well, maybe
2015-09-22 01:08:27	ScruffyChat	I do make it clear that Pikmin serve the Onions, not the other way around
2015-09-22 01:08:56	ScruffyChat	But I also make it clear that the Onions needed a leader to set things in motion
2015-09-22 01:09:10	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:09:10	ScruffyChat	So, for that to work there would have to be a Pikmin different from the others
2015-09-22 01:09:34	ScruffyChat	And I feel like other users have already captured that idea, quite well
2015-09-22 01:09:38	@PikFan	if the Onions get advanced, then surely the Pikmin should get advanced, too?
2015-09-22 01:09:47	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-22 01:09:58	@PikFan	I mean, this is all my opinion, you don't have to do this
2015-09-22 01:10:09	ScruffyChat	no no it's very interesting
2015-09-22 01:10:17	ScruffyChat	I'll have to consider it
2015-09-22 01:10:22	@PikFan	also: I have a headcanon that there was a time that Pikmin didn't have Onions
2015-09-22 01:10:29	ScruffyChat	Because I don't just want the game to end like that
2015-09-22 01:10:29	@PikFan	ah, okay, I just don't want to pressure you
2015-09-22 01:10:34	ScruffyChat	Oh wow
2015-09-22 01:10:53	ScruffyChat	I was thinking at one point that Olimar would want to stay on PNF-404
2015-09-22 01:11:03	@PikFan	because in Pikmin 1, we see that there's seeds near places where Pikmin died
2015-09-22 01:11:04	ScruffyChat	But I denied that, he'd want to see his family
2015-09-22 01:11:12	ScruffyChat	True!
2015-09-22 01:11:13	@PikFan	true
2015-09-22 01:11:17	ScruffyChat	You're right
2015-09-22 01:11:28	ScruffyChat	oh, yeah
2015-09-22 01:11:37	ScruffyChat	And then I thought maybe Edward would stay behind
2015-09-22 01:11:45	ScruffyChat	But then that would defeat the whole point of the game
2015-09-22 01:11:58	@PikFan	lol, yeah
2015-09-22 01:12:00	ScruffyChat	It's a rescue mission after all
2015-09-22 01:12:04	@PikFan	coming all this way for NOTHING
2015-09-22 01:12:11	ScruffyChat	Haha exactly
2015-09-22 01:12:37	ScruffyChat	So that leaves either DELTA or Loucap
2015-09-22 01:12:48	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:12:52	ScruffyChat	I'm pretty sure Olimar'd feel bad for Louie
2015-09-22 01:12:53	@PikFan	I feel bad for Louie
2015-09-22 01:12:58	ScruffyChat	I do too
2015-09-22 01:13:05	ScruffyChat	You've played P3 right?
2015-09-22 01:13:09	@PikFan	yup
2015-09-22 01:13:13	@PikFan	100% story mode
2015-09-22 01:13:19	ScruffyChat	Ok, so you know he gets left behind again
2015-09-22 01:13:25	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-09-22 01:13:34	ScruffyChat	And as far as the narrator puts it, they don't care to come back to get him
2015-09-22 01:13:36	@PikFan	and then left behind AGAIN, after the Plasm Wraith
2015-09-22 01:13:40	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-22 01:14:09	@PikFan	and there's that meteor at the end
2015-09-22 01:14:15	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-22 01:14:20	@PikFan	agh, so many loose ends...
2015-09-22 01:14:35	@PikFan	hopefully P4 will close those loose ends
2015-09-22 01:14:37	ScruffyChat	I thought that could be the beginning of Pikmin Forever, many years in the future, the first crash landing
2015-09-22 01:14:58	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-09-22 01:15:03	ScruffyChat	But meanwhile Louie'd either be forgotten or they'd just assume he didn't make it
2015-09-22 01:15:17	ScruffyChat	When really he's living on PNF-404 for many years
2015-09-22 01:15:31	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-09-22 01:15:34	ScruffyChat	Until finally his life-support systems give and he needs an Onion to stay alive
2015-09-22 01:16:10	ScruffyChat	it's like Olimar as a Pikmin in the first game, except with Mushrooms, louie, and he's actually playable
2015-09-22 01:16:28	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:16:44	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry, I don't want to go on and on about my game
2015-09-22 01:16:48	@PikFan	oh, I like how you introduced other life form into the Pikmin
2015-09-22 01:16:57	@PikFan	no, it's fine, I actually like this
2015-09-22 01:17:01	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-09-22 01:17:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah I thought not all Pikmin have to be plants
2015-09-22 01:17:16	@PikFan	like the Mushroom Pikmin and the Lichen Pikmin
2015-09-22 01:17:24	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-22 01:17:45	@PikFan	"A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria (or both) living among filaments of a fungus in a symbiotic relationship. The combined life form has properties that are very different from the properties of its component organisms."
2015-09-22 01:17:49	@PikFan	thanks, Google
2015-09-22 01:18:31	@PikFan	so... it's a plant/bacterium in symbiosis with a fungus
2015-09-22 01:18:35	@PikFan	interesting
2015-09-22 01:18:36	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-09-22 01:19:01	ScruffyChat	But because all the life-forms work together so harmoniously, it's thought of as just a single composite life-frm
2015-09-22 01:19:20	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:20:17	ScruffyChat	I had considered others like Algae or Protist Pikmin but then I thought of lichen and it was so convenient, it's all in one
2015-09-22 01:20:26	@PikFan	mhm
2015-09-22 01:20:40	@PikFan	speaking of protists, aren't Pikmin like protists, in a way?
2015-09-22 01:21:16	ScruffyChat	How do you mean?
2015-09-22 01:21:48	@PikFan	I've always thought of protists as creatures with traits from both plants and animals
2015-09-22 01:22:03	@PikFan	I'm probably horribly mistaken, but that's my understanding of them
2015-09-22 01:22:47	ScruffyChat	Well sort of
2015-09-22 01:22:55	ScruffyChat	There are animal and plant protists
2015-09-22 01:23:02	@PikFan	oh
2015-09-22 01:25:01	ScruffyChat	But apparently protist is currently an umbrella term for any eukaryote that is not a true animal, plant, or fungus
2015-09-22 01:25:18	@PikFan	oh
2015-09-22 01:25:24	@PikFan	that makes sense
2015-09-22 01:25:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-22 01:26:10	@PikFan	but yeah, I liked how you made Pikmin that weren't just another recolor
2015-09-22 01:26:22	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-09-22 01:26:32	ScruffyChat	I liked how they branched out in Pikmin 3
2015-09-22 01:26:35	@PikFan	I like recolors, but up to a point, and then it just starts getting repetitive
2015-09-22 01:26:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-22 01:26:47	ScruffyChat	I love Rock Pikmin though
2015-09-22 01:26:56	ScruffyChat	I don't understand them biologically
2015-09-22 01:27:12	ScruffyChat	But they're certainly a funny idea
2015-09-22 01:27:14	@PikFan	maybe the rock isn't even rock at all
2015-09-22 01:27:23	@PikFan	it's like a shell
2015-09-22 01:27:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah, maybe
2015-09-22 01:27:54	ScruffyChat	I wish they had kept the various Rock Pikmin shapes
2015-09-22 01:28:44	ScruffyChat	Otherwise they look like carbon copies when they're following you
2015-09-22 01:28:59	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-09-22 01:29:14	@PikFan	graphically, Pikmin 3 was great
2015-09-22 01:29:27	@PikFan	but I feel like they didn't use the Wii U's full potential
2015-09-22 01:29:51	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-22 01:29:58	ScruffyChat	Because it was supposed to be for the Wii
2015-09-22 01:30:07	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:30:19	ScruffyChat	And when the console trend shifted they didn't go back and redo everything Wii U style
2015-09-22 01:30:33	ScruffyChat	I've read a lot of complaints about the textures looking muddy or blurry
2015-09-22 01:30:48	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:30:49	ScruffyChat	Personally I didn't find anything wrong, except for the lack of anti-aliasing
2015-09-22 01:32:02	ScruffyChat	This conversation switches tangents pretty fast
2015-09-22 01:32:10	ScruffyChat	I'd like to hear more about Pikmin: Impact
2015-09-22 01:32:15	@PikFan	it does
2015-09-22 01:32:23	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-09-22 01:32:33	ScruffyChat	Like how you'd go about making this asteroid-stopping device
2015-09-22 01:32:41	@PikFan	yeah, that's the thing
2015-09-22 01:32:53	@PikFan	I'm can't come up with a new collectible
2015-09-22 01:33:28	ScruffyChat	I have an idea about that
2015-09-22 01:33:38	ScruffyChat	From a game idea I had several years ago
2015-09-22 01:33:42	@PikFan	I'm all ears
2015-09-22 01:33:51	ScruffyChat	You could split this construction project up by material
2015-09-22 01:34:11	ScruffyChat	Like metal, glass, oil (or whatever fuel), etc.
2015-09-22 01:34:15	ScruffyChat	I can't think of any moe
2015-09-22 01:34:17	ScruffyChat	more*
2015-09-22 01:34:28	@PikFan	good idea
2015-09-22 01:34:45	ScruffyChat	But you could create collectibles, such as real-world objects
2015-09-22 01:34:54	ScruffyChat	That have a certain amount of materials in them
2015-09-22 01:35:29	ScruffyChat	And players could judge whether they want to explore a region by how many resources of one type they need
2015-09-22 01:35:37	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-22 01:35:43	ScruffyChat	If they need more metal than glass, they'll travel to a region with more metal
2015-09-22 01:35:58	@PikFan	I also had an idea that the players could design the device themselves
2015-09-22 01:36:13	@PikFan	but I'm not sure how I'd detail that
2015-09-22 01:36:14	ScruffyChat	Ohhhh man that would be amazing
2015-09-22 01:36:33	ScruffyChat	true
2015-09-22 01:36:49	@PikFan	it just seems like it'd get really complicated really fast
2015-09-22 01:36:53	ScruffyChat	I doubt players would have an idea what an asteroid stopping device would look like
2015-09-22 01:37:02	@PikFan	indeed
2015-09-22 01:37:15	@PikFan	well, there could be blueprints, suggested by engineers
2015-09-22 01:37:21	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-22 01:37:38	ScruffyChat	Again, all you need is a shape that can collide with the asteroid at the right trajectory
2015-09-22 01:37:46	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:38:06	ScruffyChat	So maybe they could design a rocket ship out of treasures to rocket up to the asteroid
2015-09-22 01:38:08	ScruffyChat	Or something
2015-09-22 01:38:11	@PikFan	but we're talking about an object with fairly large mass, and a fairly high speed
2015-09-22 01:38:17	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-22 01:38:41	@PikFan	so the device would have to be pretty powerful to launch an object big enough to divert it
2015-09-22 01:39:12	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-09-22 01:40:02	-->	SailorHaumea (DN-boards1@2602:306:8381:yikn:vnkr:kizu:njkk:zmyn) has joined #pikipedia
2015-09-22 01:40:06	ScruffyChat	Well, their goal in doing this is to save the Pikmin right
2015-09-22 01:40:28	@PikFan	not just the Pikmin, but the whole planet
2015-09-22 01:40:34	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-22 01:40:37	@PikFan	because they know how valuable the planet is
2015-09-22 01:40:42	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-22 01:41:07	@PikFan	trying to research the mass of a big asteroid...
2015-09-22 01:41:52	ScruffyChat	Gee, considering the size of the asteroid you're describing, I doubt the n-hundred items you collect could stand up to it
2015-09-22 01:42:26	@PikFan	haha, yeah
2015-09-22 01:42:46	--	Kazooie is now known as SLPidgeotto
2015-09-22 01:43:13	@PikFan	ugh
2015-09-22 01:43:31	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-09-22 01:43:40	ScruffyChat	Well maybe if it were only big by their standards
2015-09-22 01:43:48	@PikFan	an asteroid about 5 miles in diameter would have a mass in trillions or quadrillions of kilograms
2015-09-22 01:43:57	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2015-09-22 01:44:13	ScruffyChat	I remember calculating this in astronomy
2015-09-22 01:44:46	ScruffyChat	it would carry hundreds of thousands of megatons of energy
2015-09-22 01:45:01	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:45:16	@PikFan	equivalent of 100 million hydrogen bombs going off at once
2015-09-22 01:45:19	ScruffyChat	Which could decimate an area larger than the one concerned in P1
2015-09-22 01:45:46	ScruffyChat	Probably not all the continents in P3, but certainly a radius larger than the average city
2015-09-22 01:46:12	ScruffyChat	So I was thinking they might realize it's not something they can prevent
2015-09-22 01:46:20	ScruffyChat	And they try and migrate Pikmin to safety
2015-09-22 01:46:34	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-09-22 01:46:49	@PikFan	it's bothering me so much that I have to calculate it now
2015-09-22 01:47:35	ScruffyChat	Don't worry, I had to do a lot of calculations about time dilation
2015-09-22 01:47:59	ScruffyChat	Trying to calculate how much time would actually pass going 279,000 ly in about 6 relative seconds
2015-09-22 01:48:34	ScruffyChat	It's not calculable by our physics equations, it's many many times the speed of light
2015-09-22 01:48:54	@PikFan	lovely
2015-09-22 01:49:23	@PikFan	I got about 1.9 quadrillion kilograms
2015-09-22 01:49:29	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-09-22 01:49:53	ScruffyChat	That sounds about right
2015-09-22 01:50:08	@PikFan	wait...
2015-09-22 01:50:15	ScruffyChat	that's 10^12 right?
2015-09-22 01:50:18	@PikFan	crap, I set the radius to 8, not 4
2015-09-22 01:50:30	ScruffyChat	oh
2015-09-22 01:51:13	@PikFan	no worries, just divide by 8
2015-09-22 01:51:45	@PikFan	...it's actually 230 trillion
2015-09-22 01:52:06	ScruffyChat	okay
2015-09-22 01:52:07	@PikFan	2.3*10^14 kg
2015-09-22 01:52:12	ScruffyChat	A little more reasonable
2015-09-22 01:52:16	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-22 01:52:24	ScruffyChat	Still quite the contest for planet Earth
2015-09-22 01:52:28	@PikFan	sorry, that was just driving me nuts
2015-09-22 01:52:33	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-09-22 01:53:15	@PikFan	anyway, I'll come up with a solution to this
2015-09-22 01:53:43	ScruffyChat	Look up the site NUKEMAP
2015-09-22 01:54:06	ScruffyChat	It will tell you the approximate destruction a meteorite would cause
2015-09-22 01:54:53	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2015-09-22 01:55:10	ScruffyChat	or at least i think it can
2015-09-22 01:55:17	ScruffyChat	it might only do nuclear weapons
2015-09-22 01:55:32	ScruffyChat	but if you can calculate the explosive power in kilotons, you can see the effect
2015-09-22 01:57:30	@PikFan	too big
2015-09-22 01:57:57	@PikFan	at this scale, it would be on the order of 50 billion kilotons
2015-09-22 02:00:19	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-09-22 02:00:37	ScruffyChat	Sorry, i should've told you this instead
2015-09-22 02:00:49	ScruffyChat	If you look up asteroid effects calculator
2015-09-22 02:01:05	ScruffyChat	The first link will tell you more accurate effects

2015-09-22 19:21:10	Yoshi2	Espyo: mhm, figuring out instruments is outside of what I dealt with so far
2015-09-22 19:21:33	@Espyo	so good to see any sort of progress
2015-09-22 19:21:42	@Espyo	but it's more or less a pipe dream, IMO
2015-09-22 19:21:47	@Espyo	so complicated, barely enough time to work on it...
2015-09-22 19:22:12	Yoshi2	the video was uploaded in february, and I think I did listen to it before
2015-09-22 19:22:17	@Espyo	hmm
2015-09-22 19:23:16	Yoshi2	helps when you can run the code directly and modify an address so a different song is played
2015-09-22 19:25:39	Yoshi2	I actually wonder, what if we have been looking at this from the wrong angle and the Dolphin people actually had to deal with playing back the music?
2015-09-22 19:28:27	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-09-22 19:28:43	@Espyo	on their monthly development reports, they talk a lot about audio being a nightmare
2015-09-22 19:30:23	Yoshi2	yup
2015-09-22 19:30:47	Yoshi2	and they talk a lot about zelda opcodes

2015-09-26 12:14:28	@Espyo	hi
2015-09-26 12:14:49	Yoshi2	hiho Espyo & Testyo 
2015-09-26 12:14:50	Testyo	I had written a small Pikipedia todo list for variables and such
2015-09-26 12:15:18	@Espyo	hi
2015-09-26 12:15:34	@J	you forgot to hi J
2015-09-26 12:16:01	@J	so yeah, I think stuff is working
2015-09-26 12:16:27	@Espyo	that didn't take long
2015-09-26 12:16:33	@J	I need to rearrange the cables at some point so I might end up disconnecting for a bit
2015-09-26 12:17:04	@J	no, the internet actually started working right away, I just needed a new router
2015-09-26 12:17:23	@J	I managed to get online without one by just plugging into the modem and using PPPoE
2015-09-26 12:17:36	@J	which was fun because I didn't have any PPPoE software installed...
2015-09-26 12:17:57	@J	but now I got a router so I can have the Raspberry Pi online too
2015-09-26 12:18:17	Pi	I should make it so "Raspberry Pi" doesn't ping me
2015-09-26 12:18:28	@J	heheh
2015-09-26 12:20:17	@Espyo	hah
2015-09-26 12:20:58	Pi	ChatZilla apparently doesn't allow that
2015-09-26 12:21:00	Pi	sad
2015-09-26 12:21:06	Pi	at least not natively, apparently
2015-09-26 12:23:06	@J	very sad
2015-09-26 12:43:58	@Espyo	looks like ChatZilla supports scritps
2015-09-26 12:44:02	@Espyo	JS scripts
2015-09-26 12:49:22	@J	it's written in JS, isn't it?
2015-09-26 12:50:18	Pi	it does support scripts
2015-09-26 12:53:54	@Espyo	it is
2015-09-26 12:53:58	@Espyo	now I'm really interested
2015-09-26 12:54:05	@Espyo	I have to try it some day

2015-09-26 14:17:01	Yoshi2	if you ever find some documention on how to write scripts for chatzilla, I'd love to see it
2015-09-26 14:17:11	Yoshi2	when I tried to write a script, I couldn't find any docs
2015-09-26 14:18:31	@Espyo	first result on google |:

2015-09-26 14:19:36	Yoshi2	Espyo: yup, that's all I could find
2015-09-26 14:19:47	Yoshi2	"Here are some example scripts. Go figure out the rest!"
2015-09-26 14:20:44	@Espyo	hmm
2015-09-26 14:20:49	@Espyo	well, that sucks then
2015-09-26 14:23:48	Yoshi2	well, I use hexchat now which supports python scripting
2015-09-26 14:28:35	@Espyo	mhm
2015-09-26 14:28:38	@Espyo	that's why my text is blue

2015-09-27 01:41:18	@Espyo	hm
2015-09-27 01:41:23	@PikFan	hmm, looks like you can see it https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Lunar_eclipse_from_moon-2015Sep28.png

2015-09-27 01:53:43	ScruffyChat	Viewing a supermoon is greatly about looking at the moon in relation to other objects. Often a supermoon can go unnoticed because it's increased size is an optical illusion
2015-09-27 01:53:55	ScruffyChat	What really changes is the brightness, not the size
2015-09-27 01:54:19	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-27 01:54:37	@PikFan	I still can't understand why the moon looks bigger near the horizon
2015-09-27 01:54:46	@PikFan	I get that it's an illusion, but still
2015-09-27 01:56:20	ScruffyChat	It's just that most people don't notice the change at all when it's up in the zenith of our local sky
2015-09-27 01:56:32	ScruffyChat	But in relation to trees or buildings they could tell
2015-09-27 01:57:03	@PikFan	interesting
2015-09-27 01:57:16	ScruffyChat	I guess you'd have to observe the Moon a lot leading up to the eclipse
2015-09-27 01:57:30	@PikFan	probably
2015-09-27 01:57:42	@PikFan	where I live, when the moon rises it'll already be fully eclipsed
2015-09-27 01:58:14	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2015-09-27 01:58:23	ScruffyChat	I'm hoping the US will get to glimpse it
2015-09-27 01:58:42	@PikFan	actually: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Lunar_eclipse_from_moon-2015Sep28.png
2015-09-27 01:58:58	@PikFan	that's the moon facing the Earth during mid-eclipse
2015-09-27 01:59:29	@PikFan	*Earth facing the moon
2015-09-27 01:59:35	ScruffyChat	Oh wow
2015-09-27 02:00:06	@PikFan	Espyo might see it too, if he gets up early enough, since he lives in Portugal
2015-09-27 02:00:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-27 02:01:18	@PikFan	I'm sad that this is the last eclipse
2015-09-27 02:03:29	ScruffyChat	There'll be another total lunar one above us in 2019
2015-09-27 02:06:06	@PikFan	yeah, but that's 4 years away
2015-09-27 02:06:18	@PikFan	well, at least we get the total solar eclipse in 2017
2015-09-27 02:06:29	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-27 02:07:58	ScruffyChat	Hey by the way I was meaning to say this today
2015-09-27 02:08:05	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-09-27 02:08:10	ScruffyChat	To anyone it might have concerned
2015-09-27 02:08:20	ScruffyChat	Have you seen The Nightmare Before Christmas?
2015-09-27 02:08:32	@PikFan	nope
2015-09-27 02:08:34	@PikFan	sorry
2015-09-27 02:08:40	ScruffyChat	Ah, okay
2015-09-27 02:08:42	ScruffyChat	no problem
2015-09-27 02:08:45	@PikFan	why?
2015-09-27 02:08:49	ScruffyChat	You should see it, in that case
2015-09-27 02:08:53	ScruffyChat	It's a brilliant film
2015-09-27 02:09:16	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-09-27 02:09:42	@PikFan	there's a ton of movies that I should watch, but never have gotten the chance to
2015-09-27 02:09:53	@PikFan	is it on Netflix?
2015-09-27 02:10:25	ScruffyChat	I believe so
2015-09-27 02:10:40	ScruffyChat	But it is where I recently found my closest approximation to what Alph would sound like speaking English
2015-09-27 02:10:51	ScruffyChat	Or rather, singing it
2015-09-27 02:11:17	ScruffyChat	the music is by Danny Elfman, who is a harmonic genius
2015-09-27 02:11:54	@PikFan	ooh
2015-09-27 02:12:58	ScruffyChat	and there's one extra who sounds exactly like Alph
2015-09-27 02:13:12	@PikFan	wow
2015-09-27 02:13:27	@PikFan	could they have the same voice actor?
2015-09-27 02:13:33	ScruffyChat	every time I hear the audio without the video I can imagine he'd be singing it
2015-09-27 02:13:36	ScruffyChat	Oh not likely
2015-09-27 02:14:04	@PikFan	oh
2015-09-27 02:14:17	@PikFan	do you have a video somewhere?
2015-09-27 02:14:33	ScruffyChat	Well I have this Youtube video of the song I'm talking about
2015-09-27 02:15:02	@PikFan	may I see it?
2015-09-27 02:15:06	ScruffyChat	It doesn't really give away the plot
2015-09-27 02:15:07	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-09-27 02:15:08	ScruffyChat	Hold on
2015-09-27 02:15:51	ScruffyChat	I'd listen to the whole song, but the guy in question sings his bit at 2:07
2015-09-27 02:15:56	ScruffyChat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuVFBSPGcU
2015-09-27 02:21:15	@PikFan	oh wow, the character DOES sound like Alph
2015-09-27 02:21:57	ScruffyChat	I know right?
2015-09-27 02:22:15	@PikFan	weird coincidences are weird
2015-09-27 02:22:41	ScruffyChat	I can just see him singing it
2015-09-27 02:22:54	ScruffyChat	If he could form his mouth to anything but o
2015-09-27 02:23:06	@PikFan	"We're taking all your fruits but we're not mean"
2015-09-27 02:23:55	ScruffyChat	Oh, Alph was voiced by Hajime Wakai
2015-09-27 02:24:06	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-09-27 02:24:08	ScruffyChat	I'm so stupid, it's on this very wiki
2015-09-27 02:24:23	ScruffyChat	Yeah, he wouldn't be an extra in that movie
2015-09-27 02:25:30	@PikFan	on the topic of music, the theme that plays when the Mysterious Life Form is nearby is so disturbing
2015-09-27 02:25:40	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2015-09-27 02:26:08	@PikFan	like, one time I was watching a particularly gory horror movie
2015-09-27 02:26:22	ScruffyChat	Of all the music in Pikmin, the Mysterious Life-form stuff is the most horror-movie-esque
2015-09-27 02:26:28	@PikFan	and as soon as I started seeing mutilation, that theme played in my head
2015-09-27 02:26:36	@PikFan	indeed
2015-09-27 02:26:55	ScruffyChat	It was a powerful piece of music
2015-09-27 02:27:06	ScruffyChat	I felt pretty scared by the Mysterious Life Form hearing that
2015-09-27 02:27:19	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-09-27 02:27:21	ScruffyChat	I should have played that area at night though, that would've made it much better
2015-09-27 02:27:38	ScruffyChat	I remember being much, much more frightened by the Waterwraith
2015-09-27 02:27:45	ScruffyChat	Everything about that cave was done so right
2015-09-27 02:27:51	ScruffyChat	It actually told a story
2015-09-27 02:28:09	@PikFan	people write Nintendo off as childish and cartoony, but some Nintendo games tend to have a dark underbelly
2015-09-27 02:28:12	@PikFan	and yessss
2015-09-27 02:28:24	@PikFan	I'd panic whenever the Waterwraith would land
2015-09-27 02:28:43	ScruffyChat	Me too, it'd make me frantic to finish the sublevel and move on
2015-09-27 02:28:50	@PikFan	I was afraid that it'd roll over me and squish half my squad
2015-09-27 02:28:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-27 02:28:58	@PikFan	fortunately, that didn't happen
2015-09-27 02:29:13	ScruffyChat	Right, right, you're so scared you get better at playing
2015-09-27 02:29:33	@PikFan	I mean, I do zero death runs anyway, so it makes it harder
2015-09-27 02:29:42	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah
2015-09-27 02:30:06	ScruffyChat	I've never had the ability to get through a game without losing some
2015-09-27 02:30:20	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-27 02:30:21	ScruffyChat	I think my record is like 4 deaths, 17 days for P2
2015-09-27 02:30:34	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-27 02:30:46	@PikFan	I'm trying an 11 day run of P2
2015-09-27 02:30:51	ScruffyChat	Owah
2015-09-27 02:30:52	@PikFan	but I made it harder
2015-09-27 02:30:53	ScruffyChat	Woah*
2015-09-27 02:30:58	ScruffyChat	How so?
2015-09-27 02:31:24	@PikFan	no sprays, and no use of Purples (other than necessary times, of course)
2015-09-27 02:31:29	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-09-27 02:31:39	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-27 02:31:43	ScruffyChat	Sprays have saved my Pikmin many times
2015-09-27 02:31:44	@PikFan	I started over a year ago
2015-09-27 02:31:48	@PikFan	...haven't finished
2015-09-27 02:31:50	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-09-27 02:31:54	ScruffyChat	That's a long 11 days
2015-09-27 02:32:01	@PikFan	mostly because I procrastinate
2015-09-27 02:32:08	ScruffyChat	Haha no big deal
2015-09-27 02:32:20	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-27 02:32:31	@PikFan	I've been playing Pikmin since 2008
2015-09-27 02:32:47	ScruffyChat	Cool, that's probably around the time I started too
2015-09-27 02:32:53	ScruffyChat	I played P2 first
2015-09-27 02:32:55	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-27 02:32:57	@PikFan	same
2015-09-27 02:33:04	ScruffyChat	Which I really think is a better experience
2015-09-27 02:33:17	@PikFan	yeah, P1 kinda threw me off
2015-09-27 02:33:18	ScruffyChat	Since my family really liked to play with (or against) me as well
2015-09-27 02:33:21	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-27 02:33:50	@PikFan	the first time I finished P1, it was in 22 days
2015-09-27 02:33:54	@PikFan	22, 23, 24
2015-09-27 02:33:59	@PikFan	somewhere around there
2015-09-27 02:34:04	ScruffyChat	But at least knowing what the later P2 is like can help you see past the parts of P1 that needed improvement
2015-09-27 02:34:09	ScruffyChat	Like the controls
2015-09-27 02:34:13	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-27 02:34:27	@PikFan	I finished the debt in like 15, 20 days or so
2015-09-27 02:34:28	ScruffyChat	I always lost Pikmin to the simplest of enemies because I couldn't throw fast enough
2015-09-27 02:34:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-27 02:34:36	@PikFan	but I got all treasures in like...
2015-09-27 02:34:40	@PikFan	...230 days
2015-09-27 02:35:12	@PikFan	I was stockpiling a ton of sprays to prepare for the Titan Dweevil
2015-09-27 02:35:17	ScruffyChat	Same here
2015-09-27 02:35:26	ScruffyChat	I'd spend days doing nothing but that
2015-09-27 02:35:30	@PikFan	when I first tried fighting it, it terrified me
2015-09-27 02:35:37	@PikFan	and I had no idea how to hurt it
2015-09-27 02:35:52	@PikFan	because I didn't realize you had to knock the treasures off
2015-09-27 02:35:52	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2015-09-27 02:35:57	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-27 02:36:07	@PikFan	so... that was fun
2015-09-27 02:36:07	ScruffyChat	I discovered that, but didn't think it did any good
2015-09-27 02:36:14	ScruffyChat	Because it takes so long
2015-09-27 02:36:27	@PikFan	and then I did research
2015-09-27 02:36:38	@PikFan	and then I discovered that you need to spam Yellows
2015-09-27 02:36:43	ScruffyChat	RIght
2015-09-27 02:37:09	@PikFan	now, my save file is on day 570-something
2015-09-27 02:37:13	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-09-27 02:37:22	ScruffyChat	I remember going for something like that
2015-09-27 02:37:23	@PikFan	with over 50,000 Pikmin and over 2,000 spicy sprays
2015-09-27 02:37:29	ScruffyChat	Aww man
2015-09-27 02:37:38	ScruffyChat	I thought I had something getting 1000 Pikmin
2015-09-27 02:38:29	@PikFan	I even have a log: http://www.pikminfanon.com/User:PikFan23/Pikmin_Count_Days_477-500
2015-09-27 02:39:05	@PikFan	but yeah, I'm obsessed with Pikmin
2015-09-27 02:39:12	@PikFan	hence my unoriginal username, PikFan
2015-09-27 02:39:18	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-09-27 02:39:31	ScruffyChat	Don't worry, you're not alone
2015-09-27 02:39:51	@PikFan	really? how so?
2015-09-27 02:40:25	ScruffyChat	I mean, the first day I got music notation software I started arranging the Pikmin and Pikmin 2 soundtracks
2015-09-27 02:40:33	ScruffyChat	I have about, 40 tracks
2015-09-27 02:40:47	ScruffyChat	I have all the area themes from 1 and 2
2015-09-27 02:41:02	ScruffyChat	All the combat mixes from those themes in 1
2015-09-27 02:41:22	ScruffyChat	And then I composed mixes for "tasks" and "carrying ship parts"
2015-09-27 02:41:49	ScruffyChat	As though the game's music got a reboot and responded to things like that
2015-09-27 02:42:32	ScruffyChat	And the first day I got LittleBigPlanet or Unity game software I tried to build Pikmin
2015-09-27 02:42:44	ScruffyChat	I got pretty far on LittleBigPlanet
2015-09-27 02:42:51	@PikFan	wow
2015-09-27 02:42:56	ScruffyChat	It was the version for the PS Vita
2015-09-27 02:43:15	ScruffyChat	So I built a mechanic where you could touch the screen and the whistle would appear around your finger
2015-09-27 02:43:29	ScruffyChat	The only thing about LittleBigPlanet is that its meant to be 2D
2015-09-27 02:43:40	ScruffyChat	So Pikmin-style gameplay is difficult
2015-09-27 02:43:54	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-27 02:44:15	@PikFan	that's really interesting, though
2015-09-27 02:44:19	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-09-27 02:44:26	@PikFan	anyway, I have to go, my mom wants to use the laptop now
2015-09-27 02:44:34	ScruffyChat	No problem, have a good night
2015-09-27 02:44:38	@PikFan	I might be on tomorrow
2015-09-27 02:44:39	@PikFan	night

2015-09-27 20:57:24	@Espyo	well yeah
2015-09-27 20:57:32	@Espyo	#mwchat isn't really known for being "normal"
2015-09-27 20:57:39	nick1	like i didnt do shit on #userpedia and i only went there to try and contact the admins about my ban on #mwchat and then i still got kicked
2015-09-27 20:57:44	nick1	fucking hypnotoad, what a dick
2015-09-27 20:57:45	Testyo	Are you sure you needed to swear?

2015-09-27 21:00:53	@PikFan	well, if you're going to talk about this, please keep it to a minimum
2015-09-27 21:00:55	Chiaki_Nanami	you wanted to contest your #mwchat ban, which was perfectly legitimate, on #userpedia
2015-09-27 21:01:30	@PikFan	ping me if you need me
2015-09-27 21:01:59	nick1	so where else do i fucking argue my ban
2015-09-27 21:02:05	nick1	if none of the admins were responding
2015-09-27 21:02:14	Chiaki_Nanami	in query obviously
2015-09-27 21:02:20	nick1	i did
2015-09-27 21:02:25	nick1	but they just fcking ignore me
2015-09-27 21:02:27	UltraMario	gj
2015-09-27 21:02:28	Chiaki_Nanami	if you think you've got legitimate points then this is the way to go
2015-09-27 21:02:31	nick1	so i had to try another channel
2015-09-27 21:03:15	nick1	instead of listening to what i was fucking trying to say anton is like "my channel my rules i dont want your ass on here"
2015-09-27 21:03:32	UltraMario	k
2015-09-27 21:03:38	Chiaki_Nanami	he is correct in that he owns the channel
2015-09-27 21:03:52	Chiaki_Nanami	he is also correct in that it is his rules
2015-09-27 21:04:08	Chiaki_Nanami	he is furthermore also correct in that he does not want your ass in there
2015-09-27 21:04:11	nick1	does that mean he can ban me from it for no fucking reason other than the fact i fucked with people on #mwchat albeit not doing anything on userpediaa

2015-09-27 21:06:56	Yoshi2	attacking people can get you banned quite easily
2015-09-27 21:07:21	nick1	anyways i have better things to do than argue with clique members who ban people just because they can so have a nice day i guess :D

2015-09-27 21:08:04	Chiaki_Nanami	Yeah, he will.
2015-09-27 21:08:13	SMB	He's been doing this in our channels, so we had to ban him.

2015-09-28 00:44:45	--	UltraMario is now known as UltraInkling

2015-09-28 00:48:35	@PikFan	what
2015-09-28 00:48:40	@PikFan	I'm not authorized?
2015-09-28 00:48:51	@PikFan	that can't be right
2015-09-28 00:48:58	BetaMaster	wait
2015-09-28 00:49:01	BetaMaster	`access list
2015-09-28 00:49:04	@PikFan	`access list
2015-09-28 00:49:06	BetaMaster	yeah you're only an operator
2015-09-28 00:49:11	BetaMaster	only J will be able to do that
2015-09-28 00:49:17	UltraInkling	Riiiip
2015-09-28 00:49:28	UltraInkling	I thought pikfan was an adkin :|
2015-09-28 00:49:30	UltraInkling	Admin
2015-09-28 00:49:31	@PikFan	same
2015-09-28 00:49:34	BetaMaster	you can just simply ban him
2015-09-28 00:49:36	BetaMaster	but that's no fun
2015-09-28 00:49:37	UltraInkling	DAMMIT ADAM MALKOVIXH
2015-09-28 00:49:43	UltraInkling	:p
2015-09-28 00:49:56	@PikFan	but just banning him will still let him come online
2015-09-28 00:50:12	@PikFan	eh, we'll deal with this tomorrow
2015-09-28 00:50:15	UltraInkling	Also betamaster1 doesnt he go by other names? 
2015-09-28 00:50:29	BetaMaster	no...
2015-09-28 00:50:40	BetaMaster	no as in I don't think you understood
2015-09-28 00:50:44	BetaMaster	you can ban someone's hostname
2015-09-28 00:50:49	UltraInkling	I know
2015-09-28 00:50:51	UltraInkling	But
2015-09-28 00:51:11	UltraInkling	I thought he wasnt authorized to do that
2015-09-28 00:51:16	UltraInkling	Or something 
2015-09-28 00:51:20	@PikFan	I'm not
2015-09-28 00:51:29	UltraInkling	Knew it :p
2015-09-28 00:51:36	@PikFan	it was obvious
2015-09-28 00:53:04	BetaMaster	no
2015-09-28 00:53:06	BetaMaster	you can still set bans
2015-09-28 00:53:22	BetaMaster	you could ban his hostname by typing /ban *!*@47-60-673-094.dhcp.mrqt.mi.charter.com
2015-09-28 00:53:24	@PikFan	they're not as permanent as akick, though
2015-09-28 00:53:31	BetaMaster	that's correct
2015-09-28 00:53:37	@PikFan	because ban basically mutes him
2015-09-28 00:53:40	@PikFan	he can still come on
2015-09-28 00:53:43	BetaMaster	no
2015-09-28 00:53:44	BetaMaster	he can't...
2015-09-28 00:53:49	@PikFan	?
2015-09-28 00:53:56	BetaMaster	as long as he has that same hostname, he can't join
2015-09-28 00:54:06	@PikFan	I thought that you could come online but you couldn't talk if you were just banned?
2015-09-28 00:54:12	BetaMaster	no
2015-09-28 00:54:17	@PikFan	...I see
2015-09-28 00:54:20	UltraInkling	Per BetaMaster
2015-09-28 00:54:22	UltraInkling	Well
2015-09-28 00:54:24	BetaMaster	if you set the ban while he's in the channel, he will not automatically be kicked
2015-09-28 00:54:26	BetaMaster	but he will be muted
2015-09-28 00:54:31	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-09-28 00:54:34	BetaMaster	as soon as you kick him, however, he will no longer be able to join
2015-09-28 00:54:43	@PikFan	that must be where my misunderstanding came from
2015-09-28 00:54:44	UltraInkling	I doubt hes using star bucks wifi to do this
2015-09-28 00:54:49	BetaMaster	most likely :P
2015-09-28 00:54:53	UltraInkling	I wouldn't go through ql
2015-09-28 00:55:01	UltraInkling	All the effort just for this
2015-09-28 00:55:02	UltraInkling	:p
2015-09-28 00:55:04	BetaMaster	his mom probably wouldn't let him
2015-09-28 00:55:13	UltraInkling	Lel
2015-09-28 00:55:21	UltraInkling	Assuming he's actually 11
2015-09-28 00:55:31	UltraInkling	Kinda doubt that tho
2015-09-28 00:55:34	UltraInkling	I mean
2015-09-28 00:55:35	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-28 00:55:45	@PikFan	how would an 11 year old know what oligarchy meant
2015-09-28 00:55:51	UltraInkling	How would he know ehat that one word means?
2015-09-28 00:55:52	UltraInkling	Yea
2015-09-28 00:56:07	UltraInkling	I DONY EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS AND IM 16
2015-09-28 00:56:08	UltraInkling	;p
2015-09-28 00:56:08	@PikFan	and he claims to smoke, too
2015-09-28 00:56:16	UltraInkling	Seems legit. 
2015-09-28 00:56:25	@PikFan	like, there are 11 year olds who smoke, yes
2015-09-28 00:56:50	@PikFan	but it doesn't make sense when he says that AND correctly uses the word oligarchy
2015-09-28 00:57:00	UltraInkling	Also
2015-09-28 00:57:02	@PikFan	it's rather contradictory, I find
2015-09-28 00:57:03	UltraInkling	To ban him

2015-09-28 00:57:18	@PikFan	remember?
2015-09-28 00:57:18	UltraInkling	Theres the command 
2015-09-28 00:57:21	@PikFan	I'm not an admin
2015-09-28 00:57:22	UltraInkling	Oh yeah

2015-09-28 00:57:29	UltraInkling	Rip j
2015-09-28 00:57:39	@PikFan	well, I guess we'll settle on just banning him
2015-09-28 00:57:57	@PikFan	if he tries ban evasion, all the more reason to keep him banned
2015-09-28 00:58:07	--	Mode #pikipedia [+b *!*@47-60-673-094.dhcp.mrqt.mi.charter.com] by PikFan
2015-09-28 00:58:42	@PikFan	J should make Espyo and I admin, though
2015-09-28 00:58:42	BetaMaster	as you mentioned earlier, though, a raw ban is slightly less permanent than being added to the akick list
2015-09-28 00:58:50	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-28 00:58:59	@PikFan	I don't know why, though
2015-09-28 00:59:00	BetaMaster	if everyone were to leave the channel, the ban would disappear
2015-09-28 00:59:08	@PikFan	oh
2015-09-28 00:59:20	BetaMaster	I don't think we're in any danger of that happening, though
2015-09-28 00:59:26	BetaMaster	so we should be all good!
2015-09-28 00:59:27	UltraInkling	Well
2015-09-28 00:59:32	UltraInkling	Is he afk
2015-09-28 00:59:52	UltraInkling	Im guessing he d
2015-09-28 00:59:57	UltraInkling	*is
2015-09-28 01:00:53	@PikFan	J's always on, so no worries
2015-09-28 01:01:18	UltraInkling	I never see him say anything tho
2015-09-28 01:01:19	UltraInkling	:p
2015-09-28 01:02:21	@PikFan	he can't be bothered to
2015-09-28 01:02:32	@PikFan	he's too elite for that
2015-09-28 01:02:33	@PikFan	jk
2015-09-28 01:02:43	@PikFan	but no, I think he's busy a lot
2015-09-28 01:03:08	@PikFan	and even when he does talk, he tends to not say much

2015-09-28 20:15:38	@Espyo	no idea
2015-09-28 20:16:08	Klemen702	aww
2015-09-28 20:21:21	BetaMaster	[09/28/15 02:59:06pm] <Yoshi2> so if a channel is registered, the ban shouldn't disappear
2015-09-28 20:21:25	BetaMaster	not necessarily
2015-09-28 20:21:36	BetaMaster	because if a user sets the ban, it does not go through the server
2015-09-28 20:21:39	BetaMaster	so it is temporary
2015-09-28 20:21:47	BetaMaster	if you have chanserv set the ban, then it will be permanent
2015-09-28 20:22:01	BetaMaster	because when all users exit a channel, chanserv also leaves the channel
2015-09-28 20:22:11	BetaMaster	hard to explain
2015-09-28 20:22:24	BetaMaster	but I hope that kind of helps
2015-09-28 20:34:26	Yoshi2	BetaMaster: the thing that puzzles me is chanserv leaving the channel
2015-09-28 20:38:30	Yoshi2	I have always assumed chanserv was key in keeping a registered channel alive, so I am not sure why chanserv would leave a channel

2015-09-28 20:58:58	Pidgey	ChanServ leaves the channel if it is empty
2015-09-28 21:01:14	Pidgey	When you enter a registred channel which is empty, ChanServ will immediately join and get Operator status from the DarkMyst servers.
2015-09-28 21:02:49	--	Pidgey is now known as Pidgeotto
2015-09-28 21:03:50	Yoshi2	mhm, sounds reasonable
2015-09-28 21:11:07	Yoshi2	I've never seen chanserv alone in a room, but apparently that is how it works on other irc servers too, so it makes sense
2015-09-28 21:12:09	Yoshi2	when chanserv leaves the channel, the channel becomes empty and all channel-related data is cleared
2015-09-28 21:12:21	Yoshi2	so you need to maintain a ban list on chanserv to have persistent bans
2015-09-28 21:17:02	Pidgeotto	yes
2015-09-28 21:17:08	Pidgeotto	which is why the akick is better
2015-09-28 21:17:15	Pidgeotto	and also
2015-09-28 21:17:22	Pidgeotto	in case of terrible netsplits
2015-09-28 21:17:29	Pidgeotto	you might lose all data

2015-09-29 01:36:23	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-09-29 01:36:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I was unsure about that to start with
2015-09-29 01:37:13	@PikFan	this is just a suggestion, but maybe you could put a disclaimer on your userpage that you're only taking Pikmin-related requests
2015-09-29 01:37:19	@PikFan	so this doesn't happen again
2015-09-29 01:37:43	ScruffyChat	Good thinking, I'll do that now
2015-09-29 01:37:52	@PikFan	okay
2015-09-29 01:38:27	@PikFan	personally, I feel a little bad for that user, but he has to understand that they don't relate to Pikmin whatsoever
2015-09-29 01:38:38	@PikFan	er... well, he does
2015-09-29 01:38:55	@PikFan	but anyway, you get my point
2015-09-29 01:39:47	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-29 01:41:26	@PikFan	anyway, last night I tried looking at the moon mid-eclipse
2015-09-29 01:41:29	@PikFan	and...
2015-09-29 01:41:56	@PikFan	oh, I meant to say I tried looking at it through my telescope
2015-09-29 01:42:13	@PikFan	but yeah, when I did, it was a very dark gray color
2015-09-29 01:42:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 01:42:31	ScruffyChat	From where I saw it it completely disappeared
2015-09-29 01:42:39	ScruffyChat	And then reappeared a dim reddish gray
2015-09-29 01:42:49	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-29 01:50:53	ScruffyChat	Done
2015-09-29 01:51:03	ScruffyChat	Made it nice and red
2015-09-29 01:51:47	@PikFan	looks good
2015-09-29 01:51:56	ScruffyChat	Thankyou
2015-09-29 01:56:32	@PikFan	oh, I also made you autopatrolled, since your edits are always so high quality

2015-09-29 02:06:39	ScruffyChat	Sorry my Wifi lapsed, you were saying?
2015-09-29 02:06:54	@PikFan	no problem
2015-09-29 02:06:59	@PikFan	I said: "oh, I also made you autopatrolled, since your edits are always so high quality"
2015-09-29 02:07:05	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-09-29 02:07:06	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2015-09-29 02:07:13	@PikFan	mhm
2015-09-29 02:38:57	ScruffyChat	I've been wondering about the enemies you have yet to make for PCW
2015-09-29 02:39:10	ScruffyChat	Like what would the Sparkling Bulborb do?
2015-09-29 02:39:21	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-09-29 02:39:33	@PikFan	wait, lemme look at my Piklopedia
2015-09-29 02:39:57	@PikFan	oh, that's just the dwarf counterpart to the Glitter Bulborb
2015-09-29 02:40:09	@PikFan	although...
2015-09-29 02:40:21	@PikFan	I really need to cut down on the number of enemies
2015-09-29 02:40:36	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-09-29 02:41:00	ScruffyChat	I'd say it's good to have a lot like you do
2015-09-29 02:41:12	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2015-09-29 02:41:28	@PikFan	considering I'll end up with 8 areas
2015-09-29 02:41:34	ScruffyChat	It would keep players on their toes
2015-09-29 02:41:38	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-09-29 02:42:00	@PikFan	at the same time, it feels so... unoriginal
2015-09-29 02:42:02	ScruffyChat	I've been considering adding more enemies to my game, since the areas will be so large and there are so many Challenge mode levels
2015-09-29 02:42:15	@PikFan	really? interesting
2015-09-29 02:42:41	ScruffyChat	As long as you can back up your enemy with a unique thing that no other enemy does, it's not unoriginal
2015-09-29 02:42:57	ScruffyChat	That's one thing I didn't like about Super Paper Mario, if you've ever played it
2015-09-29 02:43:27	ScruffyChat	There were maybe 70 enemies and then 150 more that were recolors of the first 70
2015-09-29 02:44:30	@PikFan	yeah, I've played it
2015-09-29 02:44:36	@PikFan	now that you mention it...
2015-09-29 02:45:24	@PikFan	by "unique thing", do you mean like an attack?
2015-09-29 02:45:29	@PikFan	or resistance, etc
2015-09-29 02:45:38	@PikFan	*element
2015-09-29 02:45:40	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-09-29 02:46:02	@PikFan	in that case, yeah, they're pretty original, I suppose
2015-09-29 02:46:06	ScruffyChat	There can be lots of fire enemies, for example, but they all have to do something different with fire
2015-09-29 02:46:17	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-29 02:46:19	ScruffyChat	Like, throwing fire, shooting flames, being on fire
2015-09-29 02:46:42	ScruffyChat	So yeah, you've got no problem as long as their all different
2015-09-29 02:46:48	@PikFan	the Fiery Blowhog and Fiery Bulblax came immediately to mind
2015-09-29 02:46:57	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-09-29 02:48:14	ScruffyChat	That may be why they scrapped the Hairy Bulborb in favor of the Whiptongue
2015-09-29 02:48:24	ScruffyChat	Hairy was too similar to Red
2015-09-29 02:48:32	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-29 02:48:54	@PikFan	oh, now that you mention it
2015-09-29 02:49:11	@PikFan	if the adults are all different, then why shouldn't the juveniles?
2015-09-29 02:49:35	ScruffyChat	Well, they're sort of stuck there
2015-09-29 02:49:44	ScruffyChat	Red Bulborbs always had a dwarf counterpart
2015-09-29 02:50:08	ScruffyChat	If they made new Bulborbs without dwarfs, people would question why they don't see dwarf hairy or orange bulborbs
2015-09-29 02:50:18	@PikFan	true
2015-09-29 02:50:38	@PikFan	DOBs could have a larger sight range
2015-09-29 02:50:40	ScruffyChat	So, there are exceptions if you have a partner enemy to a different enemy
2015-09-29 02:51:00	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-09-29 02:51:23	ScruffyChat	It's all a matter of thinking how different members of a genus are different
2015-09-29 02:51:34	@PikFan	mm
2015-09-29 02:51:40	@PikFan	oh, speaking of genus
2015-09-29 02:51:53	@PikFan	have you taken a look at the Taxonomy Project?
2015-09-29 02:51:59	ScruffyChat	I have
2015-09-29 02:52:03	ScruffyChat	It's quite in-depth
2015-09-29 02:52:08	ScruffyChat	It even covered the Onions!
2015-09-29 02:52:22	@PikFan	yeah
2015-09-29 02:52:33	@PikFan	I thought it'd interest you, which is why I mentioned it
2015-09-29 02:53:35	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, I love the phony nomenclature
2015-09-29 02:54:06	ScruffyChat	It's probably the easiest part of coming up with an enemy
2015-09-29 02:54:18	@PikFan	right
2015-09-29 02:54:33	@PikFan	I was disappointed that there wasn't a Piklopedia in P3
2015-09-29 02:54:37	ScruffyChat	For all my fossil names I just went down a list of prehistoric animal genii and then made puns out of them
2015-09-29 02:54:45	@PikFan	complete with scientific names and notes
2015-09-29 02:54:48	ScruffyChat	Sure, puns nobody would get, but still
2015-09-29 02:54:50	ScruffyChat	I know
2015-09-29 02:54:55	@PikFan	mm
2015-09-29 02:55:02	ScruffyChat	The detail is great
2015-09-29 02:55:21	@PikFan	I really hope they bring it back in P4
2015-09-29 02:55:38	ScruffyChat	Me too
2015-09-29 02:55:47	ScruffyChat	There was a severe lack of enemy info in P3
2015-09-29 02:55:55	@PikFan	indeed
2015-09-29 02:56:11	@PikFan	the Data Files weren't nearly enough to compensate
2015-09-29 02:56:28	ScruffyChat	But at least that gives us the freedom to make up our own stuff about them
2015-09-29 02:56:37	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-09-29 02:57:06	ScruffyChat	Right, we already figure out how to beat the enemies
2015-09-29 02:57:21	ScruffyChat	The Data Files were a little patronizing, if you ask me
2015-09-29 02:57:27	ScruffyChat	but the illustrations were great
2015-09-29 02:57:39	@PikFan	hmm, yeah
2015-09-29 02:58:21	@PikFan	wow, that's really broken http://www.pikminfanon.com/Template:FanonTaxa
2015-09-29 02:58:46	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-09-29 02:59:48	ScruffyChat	Is that meant for the taxonomy project or for any enemy in general
2015-09-29 02:59:59	@PikFan	for fanon enemies
2015-09-29 03:00:03	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-09-29 03:00:35	ScruffyChat	That's great, but I feel like different users would disagree on how to categorize the same enemy
2015-09-29 03:01:01	ScruffyChat	At least sometimes
2015-09-29 03:01:14	@PikFan	maybe
2015-09-29 03:01:30	@PikFan	that is, if anyone even cared enough to use it anymore, lol
2015-09-29 03:01:42	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2015-09-29 03:01:47	ScruffyChat	I hadn't even seen it
2015-09-29 03:02:19	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-09-29 03:04:11	ScruffyChat	Man, I thought making a genus and species for each enemy was detail
2015-09-29 03:04:17	ScruffyChat	This is really cool
2015-09-29 03:04:33	@PikFan	it is
2015-09-29 03:04:50	@PikFan	it was made years and years ago
2015-09-29 03:05:30	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-09-29 03:06:31	@PikFan	gaaaaah
2015-09-29 03:06:54	@PikFan	why do I have to watch a 15 second ad to watch a 16 second video that doesn't even have 50k views
2015-09-29 03:07:17	@PikFan	oh, YouTube...
2015-09-29 03:07:54	ScruffyChat	Hahaha
2015-09-29 03:13:39	--	Pidgeotto is now known as Chiaki_Nanappy
2015-09-29 03:20:40	ScruffyChat	Just added an HD concept of The Impact Site
2015-09-29 03:20:42	ScruffyChat	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/e/e5/The_Impact_Site_by_Scruffy.png
2015-09-29 03:21:03	@PikFan	woah
2015-09-29 03:21:08	@PikFan	that's amazing
2015-09-29 03:21:21	ScruffyChat	Thanks!
2015-09-29 03:21:24	ScruffyChat	Be back in a sec

2015-09-29 03:29:58	@PikFan	wb
2015-09-29 03:30:25	ScruffyChat	Yeah Pikminfan27 asked for it, and I didn't have the actual model, so I just made it a little from scratch
2015-09-29 03:30:37	@PikFan	mhm
2015-09-29 03:30:37	ScruffyChat	Fortunately the Impact Site isn't too complicated
2015-09-29 03:30:46	@PikFan	it's nice and cozy
2015-09-29 03:31:30	@PikFan	I was worried when he asked you do to the canon areas, cause it says on your userpage "Don't expect the full 3D Valley of Repose the day after you request it (or the month for that matter)."
2015-09-29 03:31:51	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-09-29 03:32:08	ScruffyChat	Well, I can't have the full area, but I can have a little corner of it like that
2015-09-29 03:32:17	@PikFan	mhm
2015-09-29 03:32:26	@PikFan	I actually like it like that
2015-09-29 03:32:30	ScruffyChat	thank you
2015-09-29 03:32:42	@PikFan	it's reminiscent of your Glade of Daylight concept 
2015-09-29 03:32:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 03:33:01	ScruffyChat	This one's actually made with a different engine
2015-09-29 03:33:08	ScruffyChat	Not as accurate but less grainy
2015-09-29 03:33:08	@PikFan	right, Cycles
2015-09-29 03:33:17	ScruffyChat	Well, the other one was cycles
2015-09-29 03:33:24	ScruffyChat	This one is the one that comes with Blender
2015-09-29 03:34:00	@PikFan	wait, TIS was made with Blender?
2015-09-29 03:34:15	@PikFan	that is, Blender's internal engine
2015-09-29 03:34:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 03:34:26	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-09-29 03:34:29	ScruffyChat	I finally figured out how to make the depth of field work
2015-09-29 03:34:43	ScruffyChat	So the background looks nice
2015-09-29 03:34:55	ScruffyChat	And conceals any little errors that may have occurred
2015-09-29 03:37:23	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-29 03:37:42	@PikFan	it is definitely less grainy, I like that
2015-09-29 03:38:25	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-09-29 03:38:38	ScruffyChat	The professional stuff is done with the other engine though
2015-09-29 03:38:46	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-29 03:38:56	@PikFan	if only you could get the best of both...
2015-09-29 03:39:04	ScruffyChat	I know
2015-09-29 03:39:34	@PikFan	oh, I've been meaning to say this
2015-09-29 03:39:35	ScruffyChat	Well, if only I had a processing unit, than I could whip out super-high-sample Cycles images like a pro
2015-09-29 03:40:04	@PikFan	I noticed that the first and last areas of your game have "Daylight" and "Moonlight"
2015-09-29 03:40:13	@PikFan	I thought that was a nice opposite
2015-09-29 03:40:16	ScruffyChat	Yesss I'm glad you noticed
2015-09-29 03:41:04	@PikFan	and how's the Glade of Daylight going?
2015-09-29 03:42:06	ScruffyChat	It's going well so far, but I'm sort of holding off on the areas until I can figure out the enemies
2015-09-29 03:42:16	@PikFan	hmm, good idea
2015-09-29 03:42:18	ScruffyChat	Then I'll put all the enemies and metal in their places
2015-09-29 03:42:23	@PikFan	right
2015-09-29 03:42:26	ScruffyChat	The enemies are really fun
2015-09-29 03:42:55	ScruffyChat	To make, that is
2015-09-29 03:43:04	ScruffyChat	In the game they'll get pretty challenging
2015-09-29 03:43:11	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-29 03:43:20	ScruffyChat	But I'm trying to go for more variety than just creative ways to kill Pikmin
2015-09-29 03:43:31	@PikFan	understandable
2015-09-29 03:43:34	ScruffyChat	There are many other ways enemies could interact with you and each other
2015-09-29 03:43:47	ScruffyChat	For example, (this is really evil)
2015-09-29 03:44:06	@PikFan	like the Antenna Beetle and Puffstool
2015-09-29 03:44:14	<--	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.op.mor) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-09-29 03:44:25	@PikFan	what's evil is that you quit
2015-09-29 03:44:27	-->	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@100.43.op.mor) has joined #pikipedia
2015-09-29 03:44:41	ScruffyChat	The Swiping Snitchbug won't go after you, it'll go after metal
2015-09-29 03:44:48	@PikFan	oooh
2015-09-29 03:45:16	ScruffyChat	It'll pick it up and carry it a little and then throw it down, partially burying it so you have to dig it up again
2015-09-29 03:45:48	@PikFan	I wouldn't say that's downright evil, but that is pretty frustrating
2015-09-29 03:45:57	ScruffyChat	Yeah hehe
2015-09-29 03:46:08	ScruffyChat	And the Lipidon is basically the Giant Breadbug
2015-09-29 03:46:15	@PikFan	would multiple Snitchbugs be able to pick up a heavier object?
2015-09-29 03:46:21	@PikFan	heh, "Lipid"
2015-09-29 03:46:23	ScruffyChat	Ohhhh that's a great idea!
2015-09-29 03:46:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 03:46:43	ScruffyChat	But instead of taking items back to its nest, the Lipidon will just straight up eat them
2015-09-29 03:47:07	@PikFan	and we thought Breadbugs were already gluttonous enough
2015-09-29 03:47:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah they'll be pretty annoying
2015-09-29 03:47:31	@PikFan	I can imagine
2015-09-29 03:47:59	@PikFan	"There are many different plants and fungi in PNF-404, and a great deal of them serve a purpose for leaders and Pikmin. Enemies can also undergo interactions with vegetation; a great example is the Bellblet."
2015-09-29 03:48:03	@PikFan	yay
2015-09-29 03:48:07	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-09-29 03:48:10	@PikFan	what is the Bellblet?
2015-09-29 03:48:30	ScruffyChat	I got the Bellblet from that plant in Pikmin Adventure that looks like two bells on stems
2015-09-29 03:48:44	ScruffyChat	That's what it is; a bell-tulip
2015-09-29 03:49:02	ScruffyChat	The thing is, if you touch it with Pikmin or leaders or enemies it will ring
2015-09-29 03:49:08	ScruffyChat	And the ring alerts nearby enemies
2015-09-29 03:49:25	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-29 03:49:27	ScruffyChat	So maybe one sublevel will have a bunch of them scattered around, with sleeping bulborbs nearby
2015-09-29 03:49:56	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-29 03:50:04	@PikFan	you'd have to be very patient
2015-09-29 03:50:14	ScruffyChat	yeah...
2015-09-29 03:50:28	ScruffyChat	Well, I'd still want to make it so that you can get around pretty easily
2015-09-29 03:50:37	@PikFan	hm, true
2015-09-29 03:50:48	ScruffyChat	I don't know, maybe there'd be a way to destroy them without ringing them
2015-09-29 03:51:01	@PikFan	spray, maybe?
2015-09-29 03:51:11	@PikFan	a spray that temporarily wilts plants?
2015-09-29 03:52:30	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah!
2015-09-29 03:52:34	ScruffyChat	Perfect!
2015-09-29 03:52:51	ScruffyChat	Which means there'll need to be some more plants that are detrimental
2015-09-29 03:52:54	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-09-29 03:52:57	@PikFan	speaking of, do you have any ideas for new sprays?
2015-09-29 03:53:32	ScruffyChat	Just one: instead of ultra-bitter, there'll be ultra-sweet
2015-09-29 03:53:49	ScruffyChat	When activated, it'll be like throwing a Pikmin, but you're throwing a glob of the nectar
2015-09-29 03:53:58	ScruffyChat	And it will attract enemies, distracting them
2015-09-29 03:54:11	ScruffyChat	They'll actually drink it up, like the Swarming Sheargrubs do
2015-09-29 03:54:35	@PikFan	interesting
2015-09-29 03:54:46	@PikFan	that would be useful in bad situation
2015-09-29 03:54:50	@PikFan	*situations
2015-09-29 03:54:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 03:55:12	ScruffyChat	I remember a long long time ago I had an idea for a spray that would actually shrink enemies
2015-09-29 03:55:24	ScruffyChat	Making their health and attack less
2015-09-29 03:55:31	@PikFan	woah
2015-09-29 03:55:39	ScruffyChat	But that'd be a little strange
2015-09-29 03:55:47	ScruffyChat	Especially with bosses
2015-09-29 03:55:55	ScruffyChat	Or worse, with enemies that are already small
2015-09-29 03:56:23	@PikFan	just have it work only on large non-boss enemies
2015-09-29 03:56:24	@PikFan	simple
2015-09-29 03:56:29	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 03:56:50	@PikFan	also, it'd have to be a rare spray, so that you don't shrink every big enemy you see
2015-09-29 03:56:57	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-29 03:57:25	ScruffyChat	And I remember thinking if you shrink it its corpse only yields half the seeds
2015-09-29 03:57:30	ScruffyChat	For obvious reasons
2015-09-29 03:57:55	@PikFan	hm
2015-09-29 03:58:01	@PikFan	yeah, that's fair
2015-09-29 03:58:03	ScruffyChat	It's for players who fear losing more than they seek gaining Pikmin
2015-09-29 03:58:23	ScruffyChat	For example, me
2015-09-29 03:58:23	@PikFan	Nintendo needs more people like you

2015-09-29 22:49:29	GarrettdaPikmin	Hi Testyo!
2015-09-29 22:49:30	Testyo	nobody wants to call them that they all go through a preliminary stage of "just type whatever", and then get cleaned up by pros
2015-09-29 22:49:59	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah, sorry, it is unlisted
2015-09-29 22:49:59	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2015-09-29 22:50:11	GarrettdaPikmin	PikFan, wanna smash soon?
2015-09-29 22:50:16	@PikFan	hey Scruffy, how long would it take you to render an Emperor Bulblax
2015-09-29 22:50:22	@PikFan	can't right now, I'm at school
2015-09-29 22:50:50	ScruffyChat	Probably a couple days
2015-09-29 22:50:51	GarrettdaPikmin	Oh. You on one of the computers?
2015-09-29 22:51:03	@PikFan	GarrettdaPikmin: yep
2015-09-29 22:51:07	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: oh, okay
2015-09-29 22:51:09	GarrettdaPikmin	Lol.
2015-09-29 22:51:19	ScruffyChat	I had a robot Emperor Bulblax in the works just for fun, so I could maybe adapt that and it wouldn't take as long
2015-09-29 22:51:28	@PikFan	I was wondering if you could do a render of this http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/8/82/Fire_emperor.jpg
2015-09-29 22:51:48	GarrettdaPikmin	Looks beautiful.
2015-09-29 22:51:54	@PikFan	thanks

2015-09-29 22:52:18	@PikFan	oh, also, if you could render it, could you add fire onto it?
2015-09-29 22:52:23	ScruffyChat	Sure!
2015-09-29 22:52:30	@PikFan	thank you so much
2015-09-29 22:52:38	ScruffyChat	I'm just getting started with smoke renders, but I'll see if I can make it work
2015-09-29 22:52:43	@PikFan	[[f:Infernal Emperor Bulblax]]
2015-09-29 22:52:43	Testyo	"Infernal_Emperor_Bulblax" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Infernal_Emperor_Bulblax
2015-09-29 22:52:47	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-09-29 22:52:55	@PikFan	hopefully this will be a good exercise for you, then
2015-09-29 22:53:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 22:53:11	@PikFan	like, it starts out without any fire on it
2015-09-29 22:53:15	GarrettdaPikmin	Gotta flex those fingers!
2015-09-29 22:53:22	En_Passant	I'm not a big fan of the Impact Site's music, so I can't say that I love the track. It feels more like a safehaven over a child's room without the glockenspiel.
2015-09-29 22:53:31	@PikFan	but once half its health is drained, it lights up on fire, similar to the Fiery Bulblax
2015-09-29 22:54:16	GarrettdaPikmin	Which game does the fiery Bulblax appear in?
2015-09-29 22:54:28	En_Passant	2
2015-09-29 22:54:34	GarrettdaPikmin	O.
2015-09-29 22:54:40	ScruffyChat	En_Passant: yeah, that's true
2015-09-29 22:54:50	ScruffyChat	I've got the other areas in the works though
2015-09-29 22:55:37	En_Passant	I can't wait.
2015-09-29 22:56:42	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-09-29 22:57:38	@PikFan	for some reason, I can imagine fighting the Infernal Emperor Bulblax to this theme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAB6JweCRBo
2015-09-29 22:57:51	@Espyo	PikFan: without checking, just using your memory
2015-09-29 22:57:59	@PikFan	?
2015-09-29 22:58:06	@Espyo	tell me, in your Pikmin 3, what is the name of the category of data files that contain info on the Pikmin?
2015-09-29 22:58:18	@PikFan	uhhhh
2015-09-29 22:58:32	@PikFan	Pikminology, maybe?
2015-09-29 22:58:41	@Espyo	...in that case the wiki is wrong
2015-09-29 22:58:45	@Espyo	[[Pikminology]]
2015-09-29 22:58:45	Testyo	"Pikminology" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikminology
2015-09-29 22:58:58	@Espyo	"Pikminology in Europe"
2015-09-29 22:59:02	@PikFan	take that with a MASSIVE grain of salt
2015-09-29 22:59:08	@Espyo	if you say you use the US version, and it says Pikminology...
2015-09-29 22:59:10	@PikFan	I don't remember clearly
2015-09-29 22:59:10	@Espyo	but that's not all
2015-09-29 22:59:15	@Espyo	Chugga's game says Pikminology too
2015-09-29 22:59:22	@PikFan	really now?
2015-09-29 22:59:23	En_Passant	lol, I noticed that too
2015-09-29 22:59:26	@PikFan	interesting
2015-09-29 22:59:29	@Espyo	and... unless Chugga is using the Australian version or something...
2015-09-29 22:59:31	@Espyo	then this is a messa
2015-09-29 22:59:33	@Espyo	*mess
2015-09-29 22:59:42	@J	messa
2015-09-29 22:59:43	En_Passant	But, it clearly says Pikmin Behavior in the picture at the top of the page
2015-09-29 22:59:45	@PikFan	heh, you tried combining Chugga and mess
2015-09-29 22:59:52	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-09-29 22:59:56	@PikFan	Pikmin Behavior
2015-09-29 23:00:00	@PikFan	I remember now
2015-09-29 23:00:17	@PikFan	...but why is Chugga's saying Pikminology...?
2015-09-29 23:00:36	En_Passant	Maybe he borrowed the game from a PAL friend?
2015-09-29 23:00:43	En_Passant	Or are Wii Us region locked?
2015-09-29 23:01:20	@PikFan	yeah, Wii Us are region locked
2015-09-29 23:01:39	@Espyo	guess I'll confirm this
2015-09-29 23:01:49	@Espyo	or I would, if I wasn't glued to the headset listening to Scruff-- oh, it ended
2015-09-29 23:01:50	@PikFan	Scruffy this sounds really trippy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chbGhcUZQmk
2015-09-29 23:01:50	@Espyo	well
2015-09-29 23:01:55	@Espyo	that sounded really great, Scruffy
2015-09-29 23:02:03	@Espyo	but it felt like it was missing some uh...
2015-09-29 23:02:06	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2015-09-29 23:02:20	@Espyo	gee, I don't know much about music theory, so I'll just spout what nonsense I think makes sense: it's missing some texture in the background
2015-09-29 23:02:25	@Espyo	like uh... long strings
2015-09-29 23:02:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-29 23:02:37	@Espyo	I can kinda see you were going for that
2015-09-29 23:02:43	@Espyo	but the original piece was so strong in background strings
2015-09-29 23:02:50	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-29 23:02:54	@Espyo	it's fine either way
2015-09-29 23:02:59	@Espyo	you could've just wanted it to feel different
2015-09-29 23:02:59	ScruffyChat	I need to go back and re-edit these
2015-09-29 23:03:00	@Espyo	which works
2015-09-29 23:03:07	ScruffyChat	thanks
2015-09-29 23:03:11	@Espyo	no worries
2015-09-29 23:03:15	@Espyo	please make more :D
2015-09-29 23:03:20	ScruffyChat	Yes yes
2015-09-29 23:03:23	ScruffyChat	They're on the way
2015-09-29 23:03:25	@Espyo	now, where was I... oh, I'll check on my copy
2015-09-29 23:03:29	@Espyo	there's no more truth than seeing in-game
2015-09-29 23:03:37	ScruffyChat	And thank you Pikfan

2015-09-29 23:03:53	@Espyo	En_Passant: don't we have things to discuss?

2015-09-30 00:51:59	ScruffyChat	I have the mouth, jowels, and snout
2015-09-30 00:52:07	ScruffyChat	Try saying that three times fast
2015-09-30 00:52:19	ScruffyChat	And I'm modeling the torso right now

2015-09-30 00:53:06	ScruffyChat	Well I cannot welcome you enough
2015-09-30 00:53:17	@PikFan	hehe
2015-09-30 00:53:27	@PikFan	like, you can render and compose
2015-09-30 00:53:32	@PikFan	Espyo can program
2015-09-30 00:54:00	ScruffyChat	Well you've got really good ideas
2015-09-30 00:54:06	@PikFan	and En_Passant just has a better eye for game design
2015-09-30 00:54:20	ScruffyChat	You're a good writer though
2015-09-30 00:54:24	@PikFan	I suppose, but I just wish I knew how to operate powerful software to complement it

2015-09-30 00:54:52	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-09-30 00:55:00	ScruffyChat	maybe I could release tutorials or something
2015-09-30 00:55:17	@PikFan	it doesn't help that I don't have a computer of my own :s
2015-09-30 00:55:25	ScruffyChat	Ah

2015-09-30 00:56:15	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah
2015-09-30 00:56:24	@PikFan	actually, I'll start right now
2015-09-30 00:56:24	ScruffyChat	I was wondering what that template was for anyway
2015-09-30 00:56:43	@PikFan	oh, it's just this really old template that isn't used anymore
2015-09-30 00:56:54	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-09-30 00:57:09	@PikFan	you know game banner templates, right?
2015-09-30 00:57:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 00:57:27	@PikFan	it was like that, except it said "This subject is non-canonical" or something like that
2015-09-30 00:57:43	En_Passant	More importantly, it's redundant
2015-09-30 00:57:50	@PikFan	exactly
2015-09-30 00:57:56	ScruffyChat	Ah, true
2015-09-30 00:58:20	@PikFan	75% of the pages aren't canonical anyway, so yeah, it's redundant
2015-09-30 00:58:51	En_Passant	Well, it's redundant because it's a wiki specifically for non-real content
2015-09-30 00:59:07	@PikFan	yep

2015-09-30 01:22:27	UltraMario	what's so different about European Pikmin 3, anyway?
2015-09-30 01:22:33	GarrettdaPikmin	Hey PikFan
2015-09-30 01:23:01	@PikFan	different dialog and notes
2015-09-30 01:23:19	UltraMario	oh
2015-09-30 01:23:26	UltraMario	that's it? :P
2015-09-30 01:23:39	GarrettdaPikmin	:3
2015-09-30 01:23:51	@PikFan	pretty much
2015-09-30 01:23:59	@PikFan	yeah, it's Pikmin Behavior
2015-09-30 01:24:59	En_Passant	That's weird
2015-09-30 01:25:32	@PikFan	did it really say Pikminology on his?
2015-09-30 01:26:19	En_Passant	I believe so
2015-09-30 01:26:22	En_Passant	Let me confirm real quickly
2015-09-30 01:26:43	UltraMario	>Pikminology
2015-09-30 01:26:49	UltraMario	>not Piklopedia
2015-09-30 01:26:53	UltraMario	wat
2015-09-30 01:27:49	En_Passant	Pikminology refers to the Pikmin family specifically

2015-09-30 01:28:18	En_Passant	It is indeed Pikminology

2015-09-30 01:31:55	@PikFan	the individual files, yes
2015-09-30 01:32:06	@PikFan	the category name is different, though
2015-09-30 01:32:10	En_Passant	Never mind, then
2015-09-30 01:32:24	@PikFan	so this was just all a misunderstanding, then
2015-09-30 01:32:52	@PikFan	well, at least we got that cleared up now
2015-09-30 01:32:58	En_Passant	Yeah, though he still has NTSC

2015-09-30 01:38:42	@PikFan	yeah?
2015-09-30 01:38:57	ScruffyChat	Is there some way I can show you an image here without having to upload it?
2015-09-30 01:39:04	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-09-30 01:39:15	En_Passant	Upload it to the wiki or at all?
2015-09-30 01:39:17	@PikFan	there's a ton of free image hosting websites
2015-09-30 01:39:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 01:39:36	ScruffyChat	I just mean for it to be a temporary image
2015-09-30 01:39:43	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-30 01:39:46	ScruffyChat	To show you progress on the model
2015-09-30 01:39:48	@PikFan	oh, I know
2015-09-30 01:39:57	@PikFan	well, go ahead and upload it anyway
2015-09-30 01:40:00	En_Passant	E-mail?
2015-09-30 01:40:16	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I guess I'll upload it
2015-09-30 01:40:16	@PikFan	because you can just upload a newer version later
2015-09-30 01:40:20	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-30 01:40:31	En_Passant	Oh yeah, like you did with the Flint Beetles
2015-09-30 01:40:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah, you're right
2015-09-30 01:40:54	ScruffyChat	That works
2015-09-30 01:41:06	En_Passant	... once you figured out its wonkiness, that is
2015-09-30 01:41:09	En_Passant	lol
2015-09-30 01:41:22	@PikFan	yeah, I don't understand why it doesn't update right away
2015-09-30 01:41:45	@PikFan	but here's the fix: you just type in ?action=purge
2015-09-30 01:41:49	@PikFan	it clears the cache
2015-09-30 01:41:52	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-09-30 01:42:03	ScruffyChat	you mean when uploading the file? Or afterwards
2015-09-30 01:42:08	@PikFan	after
2015-09-30 01:42:12	ScruffyChat	ok
2015-09-30 01:42:13	@PikFan	well I mean
2015-09-30 01:42:20	@PikFan	after you upload a new version
2015-09-30 01:42:29	@PikFan	but we'll worry about that later
2015-09-30 01:42:52	En_Passant	Any progress in your game, PikFan?
2015-09-30 01:43:04	@PikFan	a little bit, yes
2015-09-30 01:43:13	@PikFan	did I show you my updated area list?

2015-09-30 01:45:46	ScruffyChat	Working with the Groink model was worse

2015-09-30 01:46:25	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-30 01:46:26	ScruffyChat	This is just the skin model without any texture
2015-09-30 01:46:41	ScruffyChat	Like a clay model
2015-09-30 01:46:42	@PikFan	hmm, the back looks a bit strange
2015-09-30 01:46:54	ScruffyChat	I need to detail it more

2015-09-30 01:52:10	ScruffyChat	The problem was the upper fold, it juts out
2015-09-30 01:52:39	@PikFan	Yeah, that raised a red flag
2015-09-30 01:53:17	En_Passant	Would you mind also making a regular EB from it?

2015-09-30 01:54:20	ScruffyChat	Yes I was actually planning to do that
2015-09-30 01:54:52	En_Passant	Ah. Would it be a Pikmin 2 Bulblax or the big one with plants on it from the first game?
2015-09-30 01:55:02	ScruffyChat	Not sure yet
2015-09-30 01:55:07	ScruffyChat	Which would you all want?
2015-09-30 01:55:45	@PikFan	I'm fine with either
2015-09-30 01:56:11	@PikFan	I mean, really it's up to you
2015-09-30 01:56:52	En_Passant	I would prefer a full-grown one because it appears in Pikmin V, but I agree that it's your choice
2015-09-30 01:57:13	En_Passant	The areas look good, by the way. What's Ancient Valley's environment, again?
2015-09-30 01:57:30	@PikFan	Rocky, and thanks
2015-09-30 01:58:10	ScruffyChat	wait so, a fully-grown one has the plants and mushrooms on it, right?
2015-09-30 01:58:18	@PikFan	Yeah
2015-09-30 01:58:35	En_Passant	Oh, like a mountain of sorts
2015-09-30 01:59:33	En_Passant	Shimmering Lake was the water/swamp area, right?

2015-09-30 02:16:04	En_Passant	I don't have a Wii U :(
2015-09-30 02:16:27	@PikFan	Oh that sucks
2015-09-30 02:16:56	En_Passant	I'm considering getting Legends

2015-09-30 02:19:13	@PikFan	Wait, if you don't have a Wii U... then how have you played Pikmin 3? 
2015-09-30 02:19:43	@PikFan	Assuming you have
2015-09-30 02:24:59	En_Passant	You know what they say about assuming
2015-09-30 02:25:20	@PikFan	Lol yeah
2015-09-30 02:25:48	En_Passant	I've just watched people play it
2015-09-30 02:26:05	En_Passant	Speedruns and Platinum Ranks and stuff
2015-09-30 02:26:05	@PikFan	Oh I see
2015-09-30 02:26:28	En_Passant	I think that affects how I see the game's difficulty, though
2015-09-30 02:26:49	@PikFan	I really thought that you had P3, though...
2015-09-30 02:27:05	En_Passant	lolno, I'm just good at faking it
2015-09-30 02:27:05	@PikFan	Hmm, maybe
2015-09-30 02:27:14	@PikFan	Lol ok
2015-09-30 02:27:52	En_Passant	I say that the areas in my regions are P2-sized, but whenever I picture them I see them as P3-sized
2015-09-30 02:28:03	En_Passant	Because I feel like that's a good size for an area
2015-09-30 02:28:17	@PikFan	Hmm
2015-09-30 02:28:17	En_Passant	Having not played P3, I don't know how huge they feel
2015-09-30 02:28:45	@PikFan	They're considerably larger
2015-09-30 02:29:43	@PikFan	You land at the center usually, so that gives you a good way to branch out
2015-09-30 02:30:42	En_Passant	They look rather linear
2015-09-30 02:30:47	En_Passant	Especially Twilight River
2015-09-30 02:30:57	@PikFan	True
2015-09-30 02:31:18	@PikFan	Twilight River is pretty linear
2015-09-30 02:31:43	En_Passant	So having three P2 areas is probably good enough, because they'll be very open
2015-09-30 02:32:06	En_Passant	That's something I want to emphasize in the game
2015-09-30 02:32:06	@PikFan	Per region?
2015-09-30 02:32:11	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-09-30 02:32:17	@PikFan	I see
2015-09-30 02:33:18	@PikFan	By the way, have you seen Scruffy's concept map for the Glade of Daylight?
2015-09-30 02:33:24	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-09-30 02:34:49	@PikFan	I see parts of the Awakening Wood and Perplexing Pool, but not the other two areas
2015-09-30 02:35:46	En_Passant	Wait, he made a map outline?
2015-09-30 02:36:02	En_Passant	I just saw the preview-like image
2015-09-30 02:36:42	@PikFan	Yeah, he made a rough sketch of the map
2015-09-30 02:37:15	En_Passant	No, I haven't seen it, then
2015-09-30 02:38:31	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/e/e5/Glade_of_Daylight_Concept.png
2015-09-30 02:39:29	@PikFan	Notice how it's just one piece, not several pieces like P3
2015-09-30 02:42:40	En_Passant	I think I see the Wistful Wild
2015-09-30 02:42:43	En_Passant	It's on the left
2015-09-30 02:43:01	@PikFan	Oh yeah
2015-09-30 02:43:02	En_Passant	Top left is Final Trial and bottom left is Impact Site
2015-09-30 02:43:33	@PikFan	Bottom left looks like Awakening Wood
2015-09-30 02:43:54	En_Passant	You're right
2015-09-30 02:44:26	@PikFan	But yeah I see the Impact Site
2015-09-30 02:44:46	En_Passant	In the middle?

2015-09-30 02:45:43	@PikFan	The little circle is where the Orange Bulborbs are in P2
2015-09-30 02:46:25	@PikFan	Also, I realized the southernmost part is the Valley of Repose
2015-09-30 02:46:46	En_Passant	I can also see the connector from there to the Final Trial part of Wistful Wild, but it leads into Perplexing Pool instead
2015-09-30 02:47:11	En_Passant	And yeah, that makes sense

2015-09-30 02:48:19	@PikFan	Hmm
2015-09-30 02:48:41	@PikFan	I wonder about that big square though
2015-09-30 02:48:51	En_Passant	That's PP's landing site

2015-09-30 02:51:05	En_Passant	All of the areas look a little distorted
2015-09-30 02:51:23	@PikFan	Right
2015-09-30 02:51:26	En_Passant	The VoR area lacks both of its large spaces
2015-09-30 02:51:40	@PikFan	Yeah
2015-09-30 02:51:58	@PikFan	But the square is way far south
2015-09-30 02:52:46	En_Passant	It's not that far
2015-09-30 02:52:48	@PikFan	Eh, it's not bad, but I'm just saying
2015-09-30 02:53:02	@PikFan	Anyway, brb, food
2015-09-30 02:53:39	En_Passant	The sandbox fell next to the landing site from DS, and the structure where the Repair-type Bolt is was right next to that

2015-09-30 20:48:46	@Espyo	hi
2015-09-30 20:48:52	@Espyo	so it turns out Chugga's using the US version
2015-09-30 20:48:56	@Espyo	and the real zinger
2015-09-30 20:49:00	@PikFan	right
2015-09-30 20:49:06	@PikFan	we established this last night
2015-09-30 20:49:14	@Espyo	is that "Pikminology" is the name of the data file category in all regions
2015-09-30 20:49:23	@PikFan	nope
2015-09-30 20:49:26	@PikFan	just PAL
2015-09-30 20:49:35	@Espyo	no, both
2015-09-30 20:49:39	@Espyo	go check right now if you need
2015-09-30 20:49:45	@PikFan	I can't
2015-09-30 20:49:59	@PikFan	but I definitely know the category name is Pikmin Behavior
2015-09-30 20:50:09	@PikFan	the individual data files are called Pikminology
2015-09-30 20:50:32	@PikFan	so all of this is just a big misunderstanding
2015-09-30 20:50:59	@PikFan	the category name is Pikmin Behavior (US), and the individual files are called Pikminology (all versions)
2015-09-30 20:51:10	@Espyo	uhm
2015-09-30 20:51:12	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-09-30 20:51:18	@Espyo	then that requires further research
2015-09-30 20:51:31	@PikFan	not really
2015-09-30 20:51:41	@PikFan	when you view a data file, you see its title
2015-09-30 20:52:09	@PikFan	and I think you misinterpreted it as the CATEGORY name
2015-09-30 20:52:26	@PikFan	but that's just the individual data file's name
2015-09-30 20:52:54	@PikFan	I'm 100% certain of this
2015-09-30 20:52:58	@Espyo	hang on then
2015-09-30 20:54:48	@PikFan	yeah, the category name is Pikmin Behavior (US) http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/6/67/ZlCfzRFDr6IDYejLNQ.jpg
2015-09-30 20:55:07	@PikFan	the files you see with 3 Pikmin, those are the Pikminology files
2015-09-30 20:57:50	@Espyo	so you're sure that that's what it is?
2015-09-30 20:58:22	@PikFan	yes
2015-09-30 20:58:51	@PikFan	you must've misinterpreted the data file name for the category name
2015-09-30 20:59:00	@PikFan	that has to be where this misunderstanding came from
2015-09-30 20:59:24	@Espyo	looks like it matches with everything then
2015-09-30 20:59:36	@Espyo	I could swear I saw the actual screen where he gets a listing of the data files
2015-09-30 20:59:44	@Espyo	but now that I'm looking through the videos again, he never does it
2015-09-30 20:59:50	@Espyo	so I must've seen the file's actual titles
2015-09-30 20:59:53	@Espyo	so, to sum up
2015-09-30 21:00:03	@Espyo	in Europe: category is Pikminology, file titles are Pikminology
2015-09-30 21:00:12	@Espyo	in the US: category is Pikmin Behavior, file titles are Pikminology
2015-09-30 21:00:40	@PikFan	exactly right
2015-09-30 21:00:46	@Espyo	all right then
2015-09-30 21:00:46	@Espyo	thanks
2015-09-30 21:00:51	@PikFan	no problem
2015-09-30 21:00:53	@Espyo	finally this can be put to rest
2015-09-30 21:01:08	@PikFan	yeah, me and En Passant figured this out last night
2015-09-30 21:01:14	@Espyo	ah, I see
2015-09-30 21:01:18	@Espyo	awesome job
2015-09-30 21:01:24	@Espyo	in other news, this https://twitter.com/chuggaaconroy/status/648587741719068673
2015-09-30 21:01:30	@PikFan	just a little common sense was all :P
2015-09-30 21:01:41	@PikFan	oh, I saw that
2015-09-30 21:01:51	@Espyo	trust me, it wasn't common sense
2015-09-30 21:02:00	@Espyo	I've talked with at least 6 people, Pikipedia and outside, about this
2015-09-30 21:02:04	@Espyo	nobody could ever reach a conclusion
2015-09-30 21:02:07	@Espyo	plus why would it be like THAT?
2015-09-30 21:02:09	@Espyo	so esoteric
2015-09-30 21:02:14	@PikFan	hmm
2015-09-30 21:02:18	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2015-09-30 21:02:41	@PikFan	anyway, yeah, I tried throwing Rock Pikmin at a corner of a crystal wall
2015-09-30 21:03:04	@PikFan	I don't remember exactly for the quadrant, but 24 seems about right
2015-09-30 21:03:13	@PikFan	I'll test it again when I get home
2015-09-30 21:03:19	@PikFan	and I'll do the same for the center
2015-09-30 21:03:57	@Espyo	they tested it
2015-09-30 21:04:04	@PikFan	also, I found that charging a group of about 20 Rock Pikmin at a crystal wall twice will destroy it
2015-09-30 21:04:16	@PikFan	keyword: twice
2015-09-30 21:04:26	@Espyo	Jordan says ALL story mode crystal walls take 24 hits if you hit the same quadrant, 28 if you spread out
2015-09-30 21:04:37	@Espyo	what about a group of 40?
2015-09-30 21:04:43	@PikFan	not sure
2015-09-30 21:04:54	@PikFan	for me, charging is faster than throwing
2015-09-30 21:04:55	@Espyo	could be fun to test one day
2015-09-30 21:05:21	@PikFan	it'd be hard to figure out how many "bounces" it takes to destroy a crystal wall
2015-09-30 21:06:35	@Espyo	this game is starting to give me a Pikmin 2-sized headache...
2015-09-30 21:06:45	@PikFan	indeed
2015-09-30 21:06:48	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_Behavior_%28Exploration_Notes%29&diff=155303&oldid=154820 anyway, that's done
2015-09-30 21:06:50	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2015-09-30 21:07:04	@PikFan	alright
2015-09-30 21:07:14	@PikFan	I'll be gone by the time you're back

2015-09-30 22:33:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-09-30 22:33:59	ScruffyChat	Well I mean you got me thinking about it to begin with
2015-09-30 22:34:11	@PikFan	but in order to access this area, you have to complete a series of new caves that appear after the "final" boss
2015-09-30 22:34:23	ScruffyChat	Oooh

2015-09-30 22:35:43	En_Passant	PikFan, there's no need to doubt whether I'm a minor or not anymore
2015-09-30 22:35:50	En_Passant	Because I'm not~
2015-09-30 22:35:54	@PikFan	happy birthday!
2015-09-30 22:36:12	@PikFan	but... why the ~ ?
2015-09-30 22:36:23	En_Passant	To show that I'm not insulting you
2015-09-30 22:36:33	@PikFan	lolok
2015-09-30 22:36:41	En_Passant	I'm still surprised you said that, lol
2015-09-30 22:36:45	ScruffyChat	Happy birthday En_Passant!
2015-09-30 22:37:25	@PikFan	I don't turn 18 for a little over 2 years
2015-09-30 22:37:31	@PikFan	and tbh I don't want to be 18

2015-09-30 22:41:03	@PikFan	hmm, in the end, I'll end up having Cyan, Brown (or Tan), and Green as my Pikmin types
2015-09-30 22:41:15	@PikFan	3 new types... I feel like that's a good number
2015-09-30 22:41:41	En_Passant	I agree
2015-09-30 22:41:43	ScruffyChat	What do they do?
2015-09-30 22:41:59	En_Passant	Cyan and Green are standard, I'm guessing
2015-09-30 22:42:13	@PikFan	yeah, ice and acid, respectively
2015-09-30 22:42:25	@PikFan	Brown = earth/sand hazards
2015-09-30 22:42:53	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-09-30 22:42:54	@Espyo	computer froze
2015-09-30 22:42:58	@PikFan	lovely
2015-09-30 22:43:07	@Espyo	I ran Carmageddon: Reincarnation
2015-09-30 22:43:09	ScruffyChat	Get some Cyan Pikmin, they can help you out with that
2015-09-30 22:43:12	@Espyo	which is sometimes STILL a bit to heavy for my pc
2015-09-30 22:43:17	@PikFan	hehe
2015-09-30 22:43:41	@Espyo	I STILL don't understand why a process is like "hey windows, I need some processing power and disk usage, you think you can give me a slice so I can get my job d--"
2015-09-30 22:43:43	@PikFan	hm, I wonder what new Pikmin types will appear in Pikmin 4, if any
2015-09-30 22:43:51	@Espyo	"HERE, HAVE 200% CPU USAGE AND 400% DISK USAGE"
2015-09-30 22:44:00	@PikFan	*crash*
2015-09-30 22:44:01	@Espyo	"that's not even possi... like, won't that freeze everything else?"

2015-09-30 22:44:23	@PikFan	you should write a book

2015-09-30 22:44:54	@Espyo	I love how Testyo trudges through anyway
2015-09-30 22:44:55	Testyo	oh, I want to another template to put on the /merge pages, just to categorise them so we can find them all to delete them later
2015-09-30 22:44:57	@Espyo	negative time? sure
2015-09-30 22:45:17	En_Passant	PikFan, have you considered adding something unique to your Pikmin types?
2015-09-30 22:45:26	@PikFan	like what?
2015-09-30 22:45:40	@PikFan	like, unique physical appearance?
2015-09-30 22:45:46	ScruffyChat	Espyo, eventually we'll all have solid-state computers and this'll all just be a bad dream
2015-09-30 22:45:58	En_Passant	Unique abilities
2015-09-30 22:46:16	@PikFan	oh, I see what you mean
2015-09-30 22:46:31	@PikFan	hm
2015-09-30 22:46:56	@PikFan	Brown Pikmin can solidify patches of quicksand and dig tunnels through solid rock
2015-09-30 22:47:17	ScruffyChat	Does the quicksand remain solidified
2015-09-30 22:47:31	@PikFan	only temporarily
2015-09-30 22:47:49	En_Passant	I was thinking something non-hazardous.
2015-09-30 22:48:00	@PikFan	though, I suppose there could be patches that are permanently solidifed and not
2015-09-30 22:48:02	En_Passant	To me, having the only difference between Pikmin be some arbitrary condition is bland
2015-09-30 22:48:11	@PikFan	hm
2015-09-30 22:48:34	@PikFan	are you talking about special abilities like Blue Pikmin saving drowning Pikmin
2015-09-30 22:48:48	ScruffyChat	I think you mean like Yellow Pikmin also being thrown higher
2015-09-30 22:48:58	ScruffyChat	In addition to electricity
2015-09-30 22:49:18	En_Passant	What Scruffy said
2015-09-30 22:49:28	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-09-30 22:49:36	@PikFan	I don't know
2015-09-30 22:49:41	En_Passant	Even something small, like how White Pikmin are so fast
2015-09-30 22:49:44	@Espyo	<ScruffyChat> Espyo, eventually we'll all have solid-state computers and this'll all just be a bad dream
2015-09-30 22:49:46	@Espyo	hope I'm alive by then
2015-09-30 22:49:55	@Espyo	want to shed a tear of happiness when that day comes
2015-09-30 22:49:57	@PikFan	so optimistic
2015-09-30 22:50:09	@Espyo	it has to be true
2015-09-30 22:50:16	@Espyo	we're pretty much already on the rock bottom of stupidty
2015-09-30 22:50:18	@Espyo	*stupidity
2015-09-30 22:50:20	@Espyo	(ironic)
2015-09-30 22:50:25	@Espyo	so we can't go anywhere but up
2015-09-30 22:50:29	@PikFan	no
2015-09-30 22:50:34	@Espyo	I mean sure, most things about modern day computers are incredible
2015-09-30 22:50:36	@PikFan	we can just keep digging down
2015-09-30 22:50:41	@Espyo	but good grief, the stupid things are borderline retarded
2015-09-30 22:50:54	@Espyo	you suggesting we reach negative intelligence?
2015-09-30 22:50:58	@PikFan	yes
2015-09-30 22:51:00	@Espyo	could humanity even do that?
2015-09-30 22:51:05	@PikFan	I'm sure of it
2015-09-30 22:51:09	@Espyo	oh the horror
2015-09-30 22:51:16	@PikFan	exactly
2015-09-30 22:51:17	ScruffyChat	I mean we've invented the idea of intelligence anyway
2015-09-30 22:52:43	ScruffyChat	It'll certainly be stupid the day a computer can understand that it exists
2015-09-30 22:52:59	@PikFan	this reminds me
2015-09-30 22:53:09	@PikFan	I was talking to cleverbot one time
2015-09-30 22:53:16	@PikFan	and I kept trying to call it an AI
2015-09-30 22:53:25	@PikFan	instead, it called ME the AI
2015-09-30 22:53:52	En_Passant	Sounds like you got rekt
2015-09-30 22:53:57	@PikFan	ypu
2015-09-30 22:54:00	@PikFan	*yup
2015-09-30 22:54:18	ScruffyChat	So what would that make it?
2015-09-30 22:54:33	@PikFan	a person, apparently
2015-09-30 22:55:18	ScruffyChat	Then don't pay it any mind
2015-09-30 22:55:28	@PikFan	lol
2015-09-30 22:55:29	ScruffyChat	It wasn't being clever, it was just being proud
2015-09-30 22:56:22	@PikFan	by the way, how's progress on the Infernal Emperor Bulblax?
2015-09-30 22:56:53	ScruffyChat	Blender quit unexpectedly on me, but I didn't lose too much progress
2015-09-30 22:57:11	ScruffyChat	It certainly allowed me to make it look a little less creepy, and work with the original shape more
2015-09-30 22:57:18	@PikFan	good, good
2015-09-30 22:57:34	@PikFan	yeah, that flap bothered me
2015-09-30 22:57:49	@PikFan	oh, last night En_Passant and I were deciphering your Glade of Daylight map
2015-09-30 22:58:24	En_Passant	It's kind of hard to tell what's ground when nothing's shaded
2015-09-30 22:58:24	ScruffyChat	Mhmm?
2015-09-30 22:58:34	ScruffyChat	Sorry about that, it's a very early drawing
2015-09-30 22:58:46	@PikFan	we found parts of all four areas
2015-09-30 22:59:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 22:59:45	ScruffyChat	All stitched together
2015-09-30 23:00:00	@PikFan	hm, this reminds me
2015-09-30 23:00:22	@PikFan	I'm writing a fanfiction that describes what happens to PNF-404 between Pikmin 1 and 2
2015-09-30 23:00:32	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-09-30 23:00:49	@PikFan	it's only 2 chapters so far...
2015-09-30 23:00:59	@PikFan	but I'm going to write more, that's for sure
2015-09-30 23:01:08	En_Passant	I'd love to hear how Wistful Wild came to be
2015-09-30 23:01:27	@PikFan	oh yes, I will do something about the areas' transformations
2015-09-30 23:01:29	En_Passant	Seeing as Final Trial was on an island in Pikmin 1, and The Forest Navel was in the middle
2015-09-30 23:01:40	@PikFan	massive tectonic activity
2015-09-30 23:01:56	ScruffyChat	Anything about animal evolution?
2015-09-30 23:02:06	@PikFan	yup
2015-09-30 23:02:15	@PikFan	and caves, too
2015-09-30 23:02:37	@PikFan	though... I'm not too sure about the treasures
2015-09-30 23:11:16	@Espyo	sorry Scruffy
2015-09-30 23:11:21	@Espyo	but 2 months passed
2015-09-30 23:11:26	@Espyo	we're changing the featured article
2015-09-30 23:11:35	@Espyo	no more Music in Pikmin 2 as the FA :/
2015-09-30 23:11:52	ScruffyChat	No problem, time to give someone else a chance :)
2015-09-30 23:11:54	@PikFan	we have to change the poll, too
2015-09-30 23:12:02	@Espyo	thanks for your contribution once more
2015-09-30 23:12:04	@Espyo	yeah, we do
2015-09-30 23:12:12	@Espyo	and the skype folk aren't being very cooperative about helping decide one
2015-09-30 23:12:13	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Poll/nominations
2015-09-30 23:12:18	ScruffyChat	Absolutely, it was so much fun!
2015-09-30 23:12:25	@Espyo	it really was
2015-09-30 23:12:30	@Espyo	I loved watching the articles come to life
2015-09-30 23:12:30	En_Passant	Oh yeah
2015-09-30 23:12:35	En_Passant	I'm still not in the Skype group
2015-09-30 23:12:42	@Espyo	I thought you entered but left?
2015-09-30 23:13:33	@Espyo	oh, there you are
2015-09-30 23:13:40	@PikFan	ScruffyChat, En_Passant: I think it's interesting that in both your games, you have to go to a snowy mountain to rescue characters
2015-09-30 23:13:52	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2015-09-30 23:14:13	ScruffyChat	Even though the last area is a summit, I never thought of it being that snowy
2015-09-30 23:14:19	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-09-30 23:14:24	ScruffyChat	More like the Grand Canyon
2015-09-30 23:14:28	ScruffyChat	Somehow
2015-09-30 23:14:30	En_Passant	Mine's snowy, but not really a mountain
2015-09-30 23:14:40	@PikFan	hm
2015-09-30 23:14:42	En_Passant	It'll be some sort of human structure
2015-09-30 23:15:11	ScruffyChat	Like a building?
2015-09-30 23:15:16	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:15:20	En_Passant	The boss will be on the roof
2015-09-30 23:15:41	@PikFan	the Cometdust Magjay
2015-09-30 23:15:58	ScruffyChat	That's awesome.
2015-09-30 23:16:01	En_Passant	I'm still unhappy with the latter two areas in that region
2015-09-30 23:16:22	@PikFan	heh, I see that we all have woes with our game design
2015-09-30 23:16:37	ScruffyChat	It's no small task
2015-09-30 23:16:47	@PikFan	ain't that the truth
2015-09-30 23:17:19	@PikFan	Espyo: I'm interested in your online capability poll
2015-09-30 23:17:27	@Espyo	so am I
2015-09-30 23:17:28	@PikFan	personally, I'd love online coop and vs
2015-09-30 23:17:32	@Espyo	we just need options...
2015-09-30 23:17:40	@PikFan	*co-op
2015-09-30 23:17:45	@Espyo	honestly, I'm not quite sure how many options there'd be
2015-09-30 23:17:50	@Espyo	story mode is probably out of the question
2015-09-30 23:18:02	@Espyo	the only thing you could add for online would be mission or the vs mode
2015-09-30 23:18:09	@Espyo	so... the only two things in the series that have local two-player currently
2015-09-30 23:18:17	@PikFan	maybe even a level creator of sorts
2015-09-30 23:18:26	@PikFan	that you could design and share
2015-09-30 23:19:09	En_Passant	Super Pikmin Maker
2015-09-30 23:19:14	@PikFan	haha
2015-09-30 23:19:34	@Espyo	hm
2015-09-30 23:19:34	@PikFan	a 2D maker game already seems complicated enough
2015-09-30 23:19:43	@PikFan	but a 3D would be infinitely more complex
2015-09-30 23:19:48	@Espyo	so should we maybe change that to "what innovative gameplay feature would you like to see in the series?"?
2015-09-30 23:19:57	ScruffyChat	PikFan:Not necessarily
2015-09-30 23:19:58	@Espyo	- online, - level creator, - ...
2015-09-30 23:20:04	@Espyo	would probably make a better poll
2015-09-30 23:20:09	ScruffyChat	The right design can make level creation easy
2015-09-30 23:20:18	@Espyo	but if our dream is to use these polls to help shape Pikmin 4, then such a poll is already too late
2015-09-30 23:20:23	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-30 23:20:24	@PikFan	I dunno, just designing the terrain of areas seems hard
2015-09-30 23:20:42	ScruffyChat	You should play ModNation Racers
2015-09-30 23:20:49	ScruffyChat	Terrain design in that game is magical
2015-09-30 23:20:55	En_Passant	Spore does a pretty good job too
2015-09-30 23:20:57	ScruffyChat	You design racecourses for other peopl
2015-09-30 23:21:02	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-09-30 23:21:13	@PikFan	the way I see it, you start out with a flat plain
2015-09-30 23:21:26	ScruffyChat	Plus, there could be preset environments to start with
2015-09-30 23:21:28	@PikFan	and you have various tools that can raise the land or depress it
2015-09-30 23:21:35	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-30 23:21:46	ScruffyChat	But you could also build it in cave segments
2015-09-30 23:21:56	@PikFan	and then you could place specific objects, such as tree stumps
2015-09-30 23:22:01	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-09-30 23:22:03	@PikFan	and then change the size of their shape
2015-09-30 23:22:09	<--	Miles (Miles@w-18-3-19-639.hsd7.ga.comcast.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2015-09-30 23:22:12	@PikFan	maybe... it wouldn't be so complicated
2015-09-30 23:22:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:22:23	@PikFan	>"the size of their shape"
2015-09-30 23:22:28	@PikFan	redundant, kinda
2015-09-30 23:22:40	@PikFan	...oh wow, school's ended
2015-09-30 23:22:46	@PikFan	well, I'm going to go catch my buss
2015-09-30 23:22:47	ScruffyChat	That's how I'm designing the Sandbox, anyway

2015-09-30 23:23:15	En_Passant	Mmm, off periods
2015-09-30 23:23:27	ScruffyChat	You know, I'd say Testyo is smarter than cleverbot
2015-09-30 23:23:28	Testyo	before starting, you have to move the stuff from outputs next to show where the fruits are, for every single one of them
2015-09-30 23:23:33	En_Passant	Kind of an odd time of hour, though
2015-09-30 23:24:22	En_Passant	Oh, Scruffy, I just thought of a job for you
2015-09-30 23:24:34	En_Passant	Well, a request
2015-09-30 23:24:38	En_Passant	Better way of putting it
2015-09-30 23:25:33	ScruffyChat	Mhmm?
2015-09-30 23:26:32	En_Passant	Pikmin V logo
2015-09-30 23:26:46	ScruffyChat	Ah!
2015-09-30 23:26:58	ScruffyChat	Would you want it to look like the P3 logo?
2015-09-30 23:27:02	ScruffyChat	Or something new?
2015-09-30 23:27:11	En_Passant	Like the P3 one
2015-09-30 23:27:20	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-09-30 23:27:37	ScruffyChat	What color would you like the flower V to be
2015-09-30 23:27:52	En_Passant	Dark red or maroon, to match my Pikmin types
2015-09-30 23:28:00	En_Passant	Apparently maroon has some purple in it
2015-09-30 23:28:05	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-09-30 23:28:49	En_Passant	Whichever you think looks better
2015-09-30 23:28:55	ScruffyChat	Sure!
2015-09-30 23:31:05	@Espyo	ok, we really need a poll
2015-09-30 23:31:10	@Espyo	and I'm really not sure what to pick
2015-09-30 23:31:56	ScruffyChat	I like what innovative gameplay feature
2015-09-30 23:32:06	ScruffyChat	Even though Pikmin 4 arrives soon
2015-09-30 23:32:41	En_Passant	It could be a prediction poll
2015-09-30 23:33:12	-->	Miles (Miles@w-18-3-19-639.hsd7.ga.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2015-09-30 23:33:48	ScruffyChat	Maybe what are you most excited about for Pikmin 4
2015-09-30 23:33:58	ScruffyChat	Pikmin, enemies, areas, story...
2015-09-30 23:34:05	ScruffyChat	...(music)
2015-09-30 23:34:24	En_Passant	lol
2015-09-30 23:34:36	@Espyo	yeah, but I'd still prefer something that could help shape the game
2015-09-30 23:34:41	@Espyo	I've said before, but probably only on skype
2015-09-30 23:34:43	@Espyo	but what if
2015-09-30 23:34:51	@Espyo	like, obviously Nintendo as a whole know about fan-made wikis
2015-09-30 23:34:58	@Espyo	but what if there's somebody out there keeping an eye on Pikipedia
2015-09-30 23:35:04	@Espyo	and actually relaying the results of these polls to superiors?
2015-09-30 23:35:14	@Espyo	boss, these are what the fans seem to like in Pikmin games, according to this wiki
2015-09-30 23:35:18	@Espyo	it could have an influence
2015-09-30 23:35:22	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Pikmin Forever by Scruffy (+220) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_Forever&curid=9726&diff=49703&oldid=49702
2015-09-30 23:35:31	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-30 23:35:33	@Espyo	I'd like to imagine future games end up having this or that feature because we chose to create polls to ask the world about it
2015-09-30 23:35:36	@Espyo	it's a pipe dream
2015-09-30 23:35:39	@Espyo	but it's worth a shot
2015-09-30 23:35:43	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-09-30 23:35:52	@Espyo	we'll have a lot of time for prediction polls, taste polls, trivial polls
2015-09-30 23:36:02	@Espyo	but for polls about things we'd like, we probably only have this next one
2015-09-30 23:36:05	@Espyo	maybe the one after, too
2015-09-30 23:36:17	@Espyo	so if we can fit in something quick and simple, it could change the game
2015-09-30 23:36:19	ScruffyChat	So then it's just a question of what we want to attempt to influence most in P4
2015-09-30 23:36:26	@Espyo	mhm
2015-09-30 23:36:38	ScruffyChat	Enemy design? Area design? Pikmin types? Game types?
2015-09-30 23:36:42	@Espyo	still, I'll edit my online-capability proposal to a "big feature" proposal
2015-09-30 23:36:49	@Espyo	we've asked about area design before
2015-09-30 23:36:50	En_Passant	i think that's a long shot. Pikmin's developed in Japan, is it not?
2015-09-30 23:36:52	@Espyo	in fact, it's the current poll
2015-09-30 23:36:57	@Espyo	yeah, developed in Japan
2015-09-30 23:37:02	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah
2015-09-30 23:37:10	@Espyo	but it's not like they don't have people that understand English
2015-09-30 23:37:39	En_Passant	I know, but I doubt the people that do are going to be spending their time browsing wikis for content
2015-09-30 23:37:59	En_Passant	They're probably talking with NoA or NoE or English-speaking fans
2015-09-30 23:39:07	ScruffyChat	I wouldn't consider it a stretch to think Shigeru Miyamoto has visited the site at least once
2015-09-30 23:39:20	ScruffyChat	I mean, it is his idea after all
2015-09-30 23:39:38	ScruffyChat	not that he's the one who'd look over it
2015-09-30 23:40:14	ScruffyChat	But just thinking broadly, if Nintendo can influence its idea, than one manifestation of that idea can certainly influence Nintendo
2015-09-30 23:40:35	ScruffyChat	I like the big feature proposal
2015-09-30 23:40:50	@Espyo	I know, hence why it's a pipe dream
2015-09-30 23:41:05	ScruffyChat	I mean personally I've been hoping for a level creator since the beginning, I'm all for giving it a shot
2015-09-30 23:41:10	@Espyo	but we can have polls both of the "what new feature" kind and any other kind
2015-09-30 23:41:15	@Espyo	so we might as well use the "what new feature" first
2015-09-30 23:41:16	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:41:18	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-30 23:41:22	@Espyo	just in the chance that it will influence
2015-09-30 23:41:25	@Espyo	the... 0.0001% chance
2015-09-30 23:41:34	ScruffyChat	That's still exciting
2015-09-30 23:41:39	@Espyo	<ScruffyChat> I wouldn't consider it a stretch to think Shigeru Miyamoto has visited the site at least once
2015-09-30 23:41:41	@Espyo	definitely ^
2015-09-30 23:41:57	@Espyo	but if only we could find some other smaller subject to ask about
2015-09-30 23:42:07	@Espyo	area environments are done
2015-09-30 23:42:14	@Espyo	Pikmin... eh, they can probably take a page off of the fanon wiki
2015-09-30 23:42:21	@Espyo	same with enemies
2015-09-30 23:42:24	@Espyo	game modes?
2015-09-30 23:42:31	@Espyo	hmmm... but any options would pretty much be ideas made by us
2015-09-30 23:42:52	@Espyo	there's the "what man-made environment would you like to see?" one, but again, the options are kind of made by us
2015-09-30 23:42:55	ScruffyChat	We could ask if people want to play as Olimar in the next game, or as someone new
2015-09-30 23:43:02	@Espyo	hmm, we could
2015-09-30 23:43:07	@Espyo	but two-option polls are pretty poor
2015-09-30 23:43:12	ScruffyChat	Although they've probably thought that through by now
2015-09-30 23:43:18	@Espyo	mhm
2015-09-30 23:43:35	@Espyo	plus, if they unveil a trailer or something in a month or so, the poll will likely be pointless
2015-09-30 23:43:57	@Espyo	I don't think we have much of an option except for "what kind of big feature"
2015-09-30 23:44:00	ScruffyChat	heheh this is becoming less of a poll and more of placing bets
2015-09-30 23:44:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:44:04	@Espyo	online, level creator...
2015-09-30 23:44:06	@Espyo	heh, it is
2015-09-30 23:44:22	@Espyo	but the problem with THIS poll is that people would pretty much want ALL of the options
2015-09-30 23:44:25	@Espyo	I know I would
2015-09-30 23:44:29	ScruffyChat	Same here
2015-09-30 23:44:31	@Espyo	gaaah decisions decisions...
2015-09-30 23:44:33	ScruffyChat	the more the better
2015-09-30 23:44:43	@Espyo	maybe the man-made environment one...?
2015-09-30 23:44:46	@Espyo	but that's probably also far too late
2015-09-30 23:45:01	@Espyo	plus, one area-related poll right after another...
2015-09-30 23:45:05	@Espyo	wouldn't suit well
2015-09-30 23:45:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:45:09	@Espyo	gah I have no clue
2015-09-30 23:45:26	ScruffyChat	I'm just gonna rapid fire
2015-09-30 23:46:07	ScruffyChat	Want the return of options like music and sound volume?
2015-09-30 23:46:17	ScruffyChat	Like bridges from P2 or P3 better
2015-09-30 23:46:17	@Espyo	heh
2015-09-30 23:46:40	ScruffyChat	want return of rocket fist
2015-09-30 23:46:49	ScruffyChat	Or withering blowhog
2015-09-30 23:47:01	ScruffyChat	Actually never mind, no one wants the withering blowhog
2015-09-30 23:47:12	ScruffyChat	New hazard
2015-09-30 23:47:13	@Espyo	hehe
2015-09-30 23:47:17	ScruffyChat	no, that's on Pikmin fanon
2015-09-30 23:47:22	@Espyo	maybe...
2015-09-30 23:47:27	@Espyo	what enemy would you like to return?
2015-09-30 23:47:31	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-09-30 23:47:33	@Espyo	*like to see return
2015-09-30 23:47:47	ScruffyChat	Gatling Groink, Mamuta,
2015-09-30 23:47:50	@Espyo	mhm, mhm
2015-09-30 23:47:50	ScruffyChat	Goolix, Pearly
2015-09-30 23:47:57	@Espyo	they can still add another enemy
2015-09-30 23:47:57	ScruffyChat	Smoky Progg?
2015-09-30 23:48:01	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:48:29	ScruffyChat	The thing with p3 enemies is that they combined a lot of denied enemies into one
2015-09-30 23:48:34	@Espyo	I think that's the best idea we have
2015-09-30 23:48:35	@Espyo	yeah
2015-09-30 23:48:45	ScruffyChat	thank you
2015-09-30 23:49:12	ScruffyChat	i would like to see a new breadbug
2015-09-30 23:49:19	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2015-09-30 23:49:22	@Espyo	they were an interesting enemy
2015-09-30 23:49:30	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-30 23:49:46	ScruffyChat	I was talking about this with Pikfan the other night
2015-09-30 23:50:06	ScruffyChat	I was thinking any new version of the Giant Breadbug would just straight up swallow what you're carrying whole
2015-09-30 23:50:59	ScruffyChat	But yeah, I feel like we'll get interesting answers from that poll
2015-09-30 23:51:14	ScruffyChat	And people will at least feel like it has some clout in the actual game design
2015-09-30 23:53:57	@Espyo	oh, Aero suggests asking what BOSSES we would like to return
2015-09-30 23:54:00	@Espyo	to narrow down the list
2015-09-30 23:54:09	@Espyo	otherwise...
2015-09-30 23:54:10	@Espyo	[23:53:25] André Silva - Espyo: Armored Cannon Beetle, Beady Long Legs, Breadbug, Emperor Bulblax, Goolix, Honeywisp, Mamuta, Pearly Clamclamp, Puffstool, Smoky Progg, Anode Beetle, Dweevils, Antenna Beetle, Bulbmin, Bulborb Larva, Careening Dirigibug, Cloaking Burrow-nit, Creeping Chrysanthemum, Decorated Cannon Beetle, Doodlebug, Empress Bulblax, Fiery Bulblax, Gatling Groink, Giant Breadbug, Jellyfloats, Hairy Bulborb, Glint Beetle, Man-
2015-09-30 23:54:10	@Espyo	[23:53:35] André Silva - Espyo: I excluded the "obviously no" ones
2015-09-30 23:55:43	@Espyo	if it's just bosses, it's Armored Cannon Beetle, Emperor Bulblax, Goolix, Puffstool, Smoky Progg, Empress Bulblax, Giant Breadbug, Man-at-Legs, Raging Long Legs, Ranging Bloyster, Segmented Crawbster, Titan Dweevil, Waterwraith
2015-09-30 23:56:38	ScruffyChat	I think it should be enemies
2015-09-30 23:56:52	ScruffyChat	I feel like the developers want to get creative with their bosses
2015-09-30 23:56:57	@Espyo	I hear you
2015-09-30 23:57:03	@Espyo	but making a list out of those will be really hard
2015-09-30 23:57:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-09-30 23:57:34	@Espyo	and it's almost midnight
2015-09-30 23:57:43	ScruffyChat	Oh, man, I forgot
2015-09-30 23:57:52	@Espyo	doesn't quite matter if we switch the article and poll at midnight or some minutes after
2015-09-30 23:57:57	@Espyo	but I should still hurry for bed
2015-09-30 23:58:07	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-09-30 23:58:18	ScruffyChat	Well don't worry, this isn't going anywhere
2015-09-30 23:58:30	@Espyo	yeah, but it's bed time in 2 minutes
2015-09-30 23:58:35	@Espyo	I want to get something done asap
2015-09-30 23:58:51	ScruffyChat	We can eliminate enemies who got P3 replacements
2015-09-30 23:58:56	@Espyo	yeah, the guys aren't a fan of either a long poll or a poll with a lot of missing options
2015-09-30 23:58:56	ScruffyChat	Like Cloaking burrow-nit
2015-09-30 23:59:01	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-09-30 23:59:07	@Espyo	and I agree
2015-09-30 23:59:12	@Espyo	enemies would make more sense, sure
2015-09-30 23:59:17	@Espyo	but... yeah, the list would be a bit arbitrary
2015-09-30 23:59:21	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-09-30 23:59:24	@Espyo	we can cut down on bosses kind of easily
2015-09-30 23:59:29	ScruffyChat	True
2015-09-30 23:59:32	@Espyo	like no final bosses (most people would pick those, plus spoilers)
2015-09-30 23:59:37	ScruffyChat	Rigth
2015-10-01 00:00:07	ScruffyChat	And no need for ones like Snagret, we know that's coming back
2015-10-01 00:00:14	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-01 00:00:30	ScruffyChat	Maybe which discontinued Pikmin 1 enemy
2015-10-01 00:00:41	ScruffyChat	There are only 5
2015-10-01 00:00:51	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-10-01 00:00:53	@Espyo	probably too specific
2015-10-01 00:00:58	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-10-01 00:01:03	ScruffyChat	Well we can think about it tomorrow
2015-10-01 00:01:26	ScruffyChat	I guess
2015-10-01 00:01:27	@Espyo	but tomorrow is past the date
2015-10-01 00:01:31	ScruffyChat	Aww man
2015-10-01 00:01:34	@Espyo	ideally, we'd switch on the first of every month
2015-10-01 00:01:36	@Espyo	yeah, that's the zinger
2015-10-01 00:01:46	ScruffyChat	Well it's not the first in the US yet
2015-10-01 00:01:47	@Espyo	I could always put a warning "check back tomorrow — we're still deciding!" or something
2015-10-01 00:01:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-01 00:01:57	@Espyo	but the front page gets cached for non-registered users
2015-10-01 00:02:02	@Espyo	so they could come back the next day and see no change
2015-10-01 00:02:08	@Espyo	because they're still seeing the cached page
2015-10-01 00:02:15	ScruffyChat	Oh, right
2015-10-01 00:02:42	ScruffyChat	You could just put on the poll that this one is extra special regarding Pikmin 4
2015-10-01 00:03:18	@Espyo	maybe if I purge the front page...
2015-10-01 00:05:04	@Espyo	eh, no warning needed
2015-10-01 00:05:11	@Espyo	let's decide tomorrow and that's that
2015-10-01 00:05:31	@Espyo	they're going nuts today
2015-10-01 00:05:38	@Espyo	a lot of people in a call, a lot of people typing via text

2015-10-01 00:10:36	@PikFan	?
2015-10-01 00:11:22	ScruffyChat	Were you able to read the log?
2015-10-01 00:11:28	ScruffyChat	I can fill you in if not
2015-10-01 00:11:36	@PikFan	no, I don't have logs
2015-10-01 00:11:41	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-01 00:11:50	@PikFan	I said to copy paste, but alright
2015-10-01 00:12:00	ScruffyChat	Ohh
2015-10-01 00:12:24	ScruffyChat	Well we just tried to rapidly think of viable poll ideas
2015-10-01 00:12:42	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-01 00:12:42	ScruffyChat	Since the deadline for changing it is supposed to be October 1
2015-10-01 00:12:47	@PikFan	right
2015-10-01 00:12:51	ScruffyChat	And it's already October 1 for Espyo
2015-10-01 00:13:04	@PikFan	it'll be October 1 for me in 8 hours
2015-10-01 00:13:12	ScruffyChat	Right, for me in 5
2015-10-01 00:13:22	ScruffyChat	but a lot of ideas got thrown around
2015-10-01 00:13:31	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-10-01 00:13:41	ScruffyChat	Eventually we honed in on what enemies you'd like to see return
2015-10-01 00:13:51	ScruffyChat	But the list is too long
2015-10-01 00:14:04	ScruffyChat	And to cut it down would be to eliminate options for people
2015-10-01 00:14:13	@PikFan	a poll for a poll
2015-10-01 00:14:28	En_Passant	PikFan: That is called surprise
2015-10-01 00:14:40	ScruffyChat	Espyo considered we could also have what Bosses you'd like to see return
2015-10-01 00:14:41	@PikFan	indeed
2015-10-01 00:14:56	@PikFan	oh, that's a good idea
2015-10-01 00:15:02	ScruffyChat	List is smaller, and we wouldn't include obvious ones like Snagret or final bosses that give spoilers
2015-10-01 00:15:12	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-01 00:15:26	ScruffyChat	But that was at 2 minutes to Espyo's midnight
2015-10-01 00:15:33	ScruffyChat	It just couldn't be done in time
2015-10-01 00:15:37	@PikFan	hmm, would it be possible for you to copy/paste the logs and put them on pastebin.com?
2015-10-01 00:15:41	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-10-01 00:18:24	ScruffyChat	I've never used Pastebin
2015-10-01 00:18:29	ScruffyChat	is it anonymous?
2015-10-01 00:18:32	@PikFan	yeah

2015-10-01 00:19:02	@PikFan	it /might/ ask you to fill out a captcha, though
2015-10-01 00:19:10	ScruffyChat	I'll give you the link once I paste it

2015-10-01 00:24:13	@PikFan	you'd be right
2015-10-01 00:24:44	ScruffyChat	Haha sorry WB
2015-10-01 00:25:18	@PikFan	no one loves you
2015-10-01 00:26:29	ScruffyChat	But seriously, I actually love its little laugh whenever it gets you
2015-10-01 00:26:50	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-01 00:27:28	ScruffyChat	It's the only enemy off the top of my head to mock you
2015-10-01 00:28:12	@PikFan	I think the P3 Spotty Bulbear indirectly mocks you by burping after eating Pikmin
2015-10-01 00:28:20	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-01 00:28:24	ScruffyChat	And the other bulborbs too
2015-10-01 00:28:48	ScruffyChat	and the Pearly Clamclamp, sort of
2015-10-01 00:29:02	ScruffyChat	I always took its chewing as insult to injury
2015-10-01 00:29:16	@PikFan	speaking of, I like its render you made
2015-10-01 00:29:30	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-01 00:29:46	ScruffyChat	I never knew what that barrier was supposed to be made of, so I made it all shiny
2015-10-01 00:33:47	@PikFan	hmm, I find it interesting that you named the President's robot crew members after more Greek letters
2015-10-01 00:34:07	ScruffyChat	Closest to "Koppai
2015-10-01 00:34:12	ScruffyChat	and Olimar"
2015-10-01 00:34:20	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-10-01 00:34:44	ScruffyChat	If I added an OMEGA their names would spell POKO
2015-10-01 00:34:51	ScruffyChat	But four captains is a little much
2015-10-01 00:35:03	ScruffyChat	name initials*
2015-10-01 00:35:06	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-01 00:35:12	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-10-01 00:35:26	ScruffyChat	I mean, 4 captains can work
2015-10-01 00:35:34	ScruffyChat	But not for me, when 3 of them would be robots
2015-10-01 00:35:51	@PikFan	yeah, it'd be a little strange
2015-10-01 00:40:32	ScruffyChat	I noticed in at least one of your enemy articles you mentioned black nectar
2015-10-01 00:40:36	ScruffyChat	I can't remember the name now
2015-10-01 00:40:54	@PikFan	black nectar?
2015-10-01 00:40:56	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-01 00:41:07	ScruffyChat	i was wondering what it does
2015-10-01 00:41:49	@PikFan	Ashcrab, maybe?
2015-10-01 00:42:00	ScruffyChat	That's the one
2015-10-01 00:42:07	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-01 00:42:30	@PikFan	well actually, it can't make black nectar in my game
2015-10-01 00:42:40	@PikFan	black nectar is nonexistent in my game
2015-10-01 00:42:43	ScruffyChat	Oh, I see
2015-10-01 00:43:02	@PikFan	but anyway, since you're wondering, it's like the opposite of nectar
2015-10-01 00:43:07	@PikFan	it deflowers them
2015-10-01 00:43:16	ScruffyChat	Ohhh, I'm sorry
2015-10-01 00:43:18	@PikFan	*it deflowers Pikmin
2015-10-01 00:43:30	ScruffyChat	I had been reading the wrong part of that article
2015-10-01 00:43:37	@PikFan	no no, it's fine, you don't need to be sorry :P

2015-10-01 00:47:01	ScruffyChat	Also, when you brought up your new Pikmin, I wanted to ask if you were coming up with specific obstacles for all of them
2015-10-01 00:47:09	ScruffyChat	Like quicksand for Brown/Tan Pikmin
2015-10-01 00:47:26	@PikFan	yeah, and tunnels
2015-10-01 00:47:32	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-01 00:47:42	ScruffyChat	Would there be any obstacles like that for Cyan Pikmin?
2015-10-01 00:48:00	@PikFan	ice floors, maybe
2015-10-01 00:48:06	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-01 00:48:12	@PikFan	they would be too cold for other Pikmin to cross
2015-10-01 00:48:19	@PikFan	also, liquid nitrogen gates
2015-10-01 00:48:48	@PikFan	in my mind, they look like P3 electric gates, but instead with liquid nitrogen flowing through the tube
2015-10-01 00:48:54	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-01 00:49:29	ScruffyChat	That is cool (pun intended), but I don't know how often that would realistically show up
2015-10-01 00:50:18	ScruffyChat	I mean that could occur, but not as ubiquitously as electric gates
2015-10-01 00:50:27	@PikFan	true
2015-10-01 00:50:47	@PikFan	oh well, broken logic is broken

2015-10-01 00:50:59	@PikFan	I can't make everything realistic
2015-10-01 00:51:22	ScruffyChat	yeah, and it doesn't matter anyway, Pikmin is not meant to be a realistic game
2015-10-01 00:51:25	@PikFan	I mean, I COULD have just an ice gate, but that's boring
2015-10-01 00:51:28	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-10-01 00:51:45	ScruffyChat	I'd much rather take down liquid nitrogen tubes

2015-10-01 00:51:52	@PikFan	*same
2015-10-01 00:52:10	@PikFan	as for Green Pikmin... pools of acid
2015-10-01 00:52:15	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-01 00:52:20	ScruffyChat	Would they clean it up?
2015-10-01 00:52:34	@PikFan	hmm, I'm not too sure about that
2015-10-01 00:52:53	@PikFan	because anything can be an acid, water included
2015-10-01 00:52:58	ScruffyChat	right
2015-10-01 00:53:18	@PikFan	so as soon as the water reached pH 7, it'd become harmful to them
2015-10-01 00:53:33	ScruffyChat	Greater than seven
2015-10-01 00:53:39	@PikFan	oh, true
2015-10-01 00:53:41	ScruffyChat	pH 7 is normal for water

2015-10-01 00:54:11	ScruffyChat	In my game, this sort of obstacle is pollution
2015-10-01 00:54:16	@PikFan	well, I mean, Green Pikmin aren't used to neutral acidity
2015-10-01 00:54:23	ScruffyChat	And I'm thinking it'll work like water
2015-10-01 00:54:33	@PikFan	don't Lichen Pikmin clean that up?
2015-10-01 00:54:36	@PikFan	also, hi En_Passant
2015-10-01 00:54:52	ScruffyChat	Lichen pikmin can get through it fine, but they can't clean it up unless there's some sort of source
2015-10-01 00:55:03	ScruffyChat	Which I'm thinking will be like the bubble of fungus in P2
2015-10-01 00:55:04	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-01 00:55:08	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-01 00:55:38	@PikFan	brb
2015-10-01 00:55:39	ScruffyChat	So sometimes that might float around in water, and Lichen Pikmin would have to clean it before even Blue Pikmin could enter

2015-10-01 01:00:44	ScruffyChat	It's live recorded
2015-10-01 01:00:55	En_Passant	I felt like they didn't use many instruments
2015-10-01 01:01:05	En_Passant	Count the number of tracks that feature a saxophone
2015-10-01 01:01:44	ScruffyChat	But at least it's a real saxophone
2015-10-01 01:01:57	ScruffyChat	plus the main theme is actually pretty heavy

2015-10-01 01:35:16	@PikFan	but it certainly does sound cold

2015-10-01 01:35:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-01 01:36:25	ScruffyChat	So then that's the last area?
2015-10-01 01:37:03	@PikFan	it might be
2015-10-01 01:37:26	@PikFan	like, towards the end, when all of the areas are unlocked, I want there to be options
2015-10-01 01:37:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-10-01 01:37:43	@PikFan	the final battle will take place in one of the earlier areas, I imagine
2015-10-01 01:37:50	ScruffyChat	That's a good idea
2015-10-01 01:38:04	ScruffyChat	Would it be a region that you hadn't seen before though?
2015-10-01 01:38:11	@PikFan	quite possibly, yes
2015-10-01 01:38:21	@PikFan	it might also be a cave, or something
2015-10-01 01:38:28	@PikFan	I'm not sure how to set it up
2015-10-01 01:38:37	@PikFan	I still have to flesh out these new areas
2015-10-01 01:38:59	ScruffyChat	Yeah, no problem
2015-10-01 01:39:22	@PikFan	and then... the Deceiving Plateau will be the true final area
2015-10-01 01:39:29	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-01 01:39:40	@PikFan	after all 8 new caves are completed
2015-10-01 01:39:45	ScruffyChat	You've got so much game
2015-10-01 01:39:50	ScruffyChat	It's awesome
2015-10-01 01:39:57	@PikFan	thanks
2015-10-01 01:40:22	@PikFan	this was meant to be a big game anyway, but now I really want it to be big, since P3 was so short
2015-10-01 01:40:34	ScruffyChat	And you've got just the breadth of enemies that would fit that big a game
2015-10-01 01:40:42	@PikFan	really?
2015-10-01 01:40:50	@PikFan	I mean, I'm not even done
2015-10-01 01:40:59	@PikFan	I need to finish the Piklopedia sometime
2015-10-01 01:41:01	ScruffyChat	By all means, keep going
2015-10-01 01:41:11	@PikFan	alright
2015-10-01 01:41:21	ScruffyChat	With so much ground to cover, there needs to be a lot of diversity
2015-10-01 01:41:32	@PikFan	right
2015-10-01 01:41:34	ScruffyChat	I've realized that, with my huge areas, I need more enemies
2015-10-01 01:41:40	@PikFan	maybe
2015-10-01 01:41:44	ScruffyChat	And more metal objects
2015-10-01 01:41:46	@PikFan	but you only have 6 areas
2015-10-01 01:41:55	@PikFan	counting that last area
2015-10-01 01:41:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah, but they're really big, plus caves
2015-10-01 01:42:08	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure what to do with that last area yet
2015-10-01 01:42:08	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-01 01:42:14	ScruffyChat	I know it'll be the most challenging one
2015-10-01 01:42:18	@PikFan	something... Biome?
2015-10-01 01:42:24	ScruffyChat	Bemusing Biome
2015-10-01 01:42:26	@PikFan	can't remember exactly
2015-10-01 01:42:28	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-01 01:42:29	ScruffyChat	Bemusing being puzzling
2015-10-01 01:42:49	@PikFan	right, I just searched its definition
2015-10-01 01:42:51	ScruffyChat	Because it'll certainly be puzzling
2015-10-01 01:43:00	ScruffyChat	And it'll introduce new enemies, bosses, and metal
2015-10-01 01:43:18	ScruffyChat	I've been thinking it could sort of be a super-area
2015-10-01 01:43:27	ScruffyChat	That doesn't represent any one season but all of them
2015-10-01 01:43:33	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-01 01:43:39	ScruffyChat	And has equal levels of all hazards
2015-10-01 01:43:41	@PikFan	hence the name, Biome
2015-10-01 01:43:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-01 01:44:19	@PikFan	how big will it be compared to the other areas?
2015-10-01 01:44:43	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure, I'd like to say about as big as the other ones
2015-10-01 01:44:56	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-01 01:44:57	ScruffyChat	But still with its own caves
2015-10-01 01:45:03	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-01 01:45:46	ScruffyChat	And there needs to be a little waterfall somewhere, that's what I'm picturing
2015-10-01 01:45:58	@PikFan	oh yes
2015-10-01 01:46:03	@PikFan	don't forget the waterfall
2015-10-01 01:46:08	ScruffyChat	Hehe yeah
2015-10-01 01:46:29	@PikFan	hm, now that I think on it, I realize that most of my areas will have a river of sorts
2015-10-01 01:46:40	ScruffyChat	That's good
2015-10-01 01:46:58	@PikFan	I need to tweak Rugged Tundra a bit
2015-10-01 01:47:07	@PikFan	it's got a river coming from the mountain
2015-10-01 01:47:16	@PikFan	like, from the inside
2015-10-01 01:47:23	@PikFan	how is that possible
2015-10-01 01:47:29	@PikFan	so, I need to fix that
2015-10-01 01:47:53	@PikFan	also, is it possible to have a hot springs in a cold climate?
2015-10-01 01:48:24	ScruffyChat	Let's ask those geysers in the Distant Tundra
2015-10-01 01:48:29	ScruffyChat	I'd think os
2015-10-01 01:48:32	ScruffyChat	so*
2015-10-01 01:48:44	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2015-10-01 01:49:18	@PikFan	but here, this will be a hot springs that you can walk into
2015-10-01 01:49:29	@PikFan	...wait, hold on...
2015-10-01 01:49:34	@PikFan	ugh, I need to change that too
2015-10-01 01:49:38	@PikFan	...maybe I don't
2015-10-01 01:49:51	ScruffyChat	oh, yeah, hot springs are heated geothermally
2015-10-01 01:49:57	ScruffyChat	So they can exist in cold climates
2015-10-01 01:50:19	@PikFan	well, the reason I'm rambling to myself is that right now, it has a switch that can deactivate it
2015-10-01 01:50:35	@PikFan	and...
2015-10-01 01:50:35	ScruffyChat	What does, the hot spring?
2015-10-01 01:50:38	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-01 01:50:48	@PikFan	because there's an island in the middle with a cave
2015-10-01 01:51:06	@PikFan	so you have to turn off the hot springs to reach the island
2015-10-01 01:51:11	ScruffyChat	ohhh, I see
2015-10-01 01:51:11	@PikFan	...it's nonsense
2015-10-01 01:51:30	@PikFan	it's all just a big mess
2015-10-01 01:51:50	ScruffyChat	no no it's all just inspiration that needs a little tweaking
2015-10-01 01:52:10	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-01 01:52:13	ScruffyChat	For example, you could have Pikmin carry rocks or fragments to build a bridge
2015-10-01 01:52:22	@PikFan	oh, good point
2015-10-01 01:52:34	ScruffyChat	Or better yet, have Cyan Pikmin carry ice chunks into the water to temporarily cool it
2015-10-01 01:52:39	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-01 01:52:46	@PikFan	that would be an interesting mechanic
2015-10-01 01:52:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-10-01 01:53:23	@PikFan	well, wait, they can't carry them INTO the water
2015-10-01 01:53:32	@PikFan	but they should be able to throw them, so it works out anyway
2015-10-01 01:53:36	ScruffyChat	Righto
2015-10-01 01:54:40	ScruffyChat	I remember I built a game on LittleBigPlanet very similar to Pikmin, except it was just two explorers trying to bring minerals back to their ship. They could throw each other and whistle each other back.
2015-10-01 01:54:57	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-01 01:54:58	ScruffyChat	And one mechanic I got from that was that puddles of water could possibly be removed with bombs
2015-10-01 01:55:09	ScruffyChat	Since they would scatter the water
2015-10-01 01:55:11	@PikFan	hmmmm
2015-10-01 01:55:18	@PikFan	oh, bomb rocks
2015-10-01 01:55:30	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-10-01 01:55:44	@PikFan	I also had an idea that there could be a rockslide (which would be started with bomb rocks) that could temporarily dam the river
2015-10-01 01:55:53	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2015-10-01 01:56:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah I like cinematic events like that
2015-10-01 01:56:09	ScruffyChat	Like the dam in P3
2015-10-01 01:56:19	@PikFan	mhm
2015-10-01 01:56:35	@PikFan	I loved the Twilight River's lilypad mechanic
2015-10-01 01:57:05	ScruffyChat	I remember way back when P2 was the only one I had tried, I thought of this really dramatic event for a Pikmin game
2015-10-01 01:57:10	@PikFan	funnily enough, there was a similar mechanic I detailed in my Icicle Abyss cave http://www.pikminfanon.com/Icicle_Abyss
2015-10-01 01:57:19	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-10-01 01:58:13	ScruffyChat	Where beating a Pileated Snagret on some cliff would cause it to fall off the edge in a cutscene, and it would burrow into the ground below revealing a cave
2015-10-01 01:58:27	ScruffyChat	It's pretty ridiculous
2015-10-01 01:58:38	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-01 01:59:48	ScruffyChat	But I outgrew that, for sure
2015-10-01 01:59:56	@PikFan	hehe
2015-10-01 02:00:10	@PikFan	yeah, I've pretty much outgrown most of PCW, as you can tell
2015-10-01 02:00:27	ScruffyChat	Well, Icicle Abyss certainly sounds challenging
2015-10-01 02:01:20	@PikFan	challenging?
2015-10-01 02:01:37	@PikFan	hm, the first and fourth sublevels are a bit challenging, I suppose
2015-10-01 02:02:13	ScruffyChat	Oh yes, the edgeless maze with icicles certainly gives me... chills
2015-10-01 02:02:23	@PikFan	hehe
2015-10-01 02:02:47	@PikFan	yeah, the puzzle in the 4th sublevel is based off this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lynVTxLwTcI
2015-10-01 02:03:15	@PikFan	the first part of the video
2015-10-01 02:04:05	ScruffyChat	Ah, yeah
2015-10-01 02:10:15	ScruffyChat	That puzzle looks pretty difficult
2015-10-01 02:10:25	ScruffyChat	But then you have to worry about icicles falling
2015-10-01 02:10:56	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-01 02:11:11	@PikFan	I need to tone that down, then
2015-10-01 02:11:52	ScruffyChat	Well, I think adding edges would be fine
2015-10-01 02:12:22	ScruffyChat	As far as I see there is no ground in pikmin games without raised edges
2015-10-01 02:12:37	ScruffyChat	Unless, you know, it's raised ground from which you can fall safely
2015-10-01 02:13:02	@PikFan	Clockwork Chasm
2015-10-01 02:13:33	@PikFan	that has no edges
2015-10-01 02:14:01	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2015-10-01 02:14:24	ScruffyChat	Well, it could work then I guess
2015-10-01 02:14:30	ScruffyChat	But maybe not so early in the game
2015-10-01 02:15:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-01 02:16:01	@PikFan	I'll fix that
2015-10-01 02:20:16	ScruffyChat	Oh, I wanted to ask you from a game design perspective if this idea is unnecessary
2015-10-01 02:20:25	ScruffyChat	If processing power were no object

2015-10-01 02:21:09	ScruffyChat	I mentioned in Pikmin Forever that enemies will be greatly more interactive, and have more behaviors so they act more like animals
2015-10-01 02:21:21	@PikFan	go for it
2015-10-01 02:21:36	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-01 02:21:48	ScruffyChat	Because at times I thought it a little unnecessary
2015-10-01 02:21:57	@PikFan	even in P3 enemies already show more realism
2015-10-01 02:22:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-01 02:22:16	@PikFan	like the Whiptongue Bulborb, and how it scratches itself occasionally
2015-10-01 02:22:59	ScruffyChat	For instance, if a Dwarf Red Bulborb snags a Pikmin then it another can possibly try to steal it from him, and they fight over it, prolonging the time the Pikmin can be saved
2015-10-01 02:23:54	ScruffyChat	But if a Dwarf Orange Bulborb snags a Pikmin, it will carry it to an Orange Bulborb (if one is nearby) and let the Orange Bulborb wake up and eat it

2015-10-01 02:24:27	@PikFan	maybe, yes
2015-10-01 02:24:49	@PikFan	that seems promising
2015-10-01 02:26:04	ScruffyChat	Cool, thank you, sometimes I thought it'd be too much

2015-10-01 19:56:26	@Espyo	hi
2015-10-01 19:56:33	@Espyo	so I thought up of some new polls during work
2015-10-01 19:57:14	Yoshi2	ah, more polls
2015-10-01 19:58:59	Yoshi2	Espyo: what polls did you think up?
2015-10-01 20:01:05	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Poll/nominations the last three ones
2015-10-01 20:06:22	@Espyo	any one of those three would probably be great for what we want
2015-10-01 20:06:34	@Espyo	enemies/bosses would be good too... but we'd get nowhere deciding what to put on the list
2015-10-01 20:08:43	Yoshi2	the missing feature or the "which aspect should be expanded" poll are nice
2015-10-01 20:10:39	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-10-01 20:10:53	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-01 20:11:43	ScruffyChat	I like the missing feature one, I gave it my vote
2015-10-01 20:12:08	ScruffyChat	And suggested to add "White Pikmin and/or Purple Pikmin in the main game"
2015-10-01 20:12:13	@Espyo	yeah, I saw
2015-10-01 20:12:15	@Espyo	all right, thanks

2015-10-01 20:14:07	@J	didn't Luigi's Mansion have a Pikmin advert in the game?
2015-10-01 20:14:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-01 20:14:52	ScruffyChat	The option was just called "View a Pikmin Movie"

2015-10-01 20:27:16	@J	yeah, for some reason I remember mine too
2015-10-01 20:27:42	@J	maybe because I had already played Pikmin 2 quite a lot and knew what day counts meant already

2015-10-01 20:31:23	Yoshi2	which I already poured over 30 hours into
2015-10-01 20:31:24	@J	you could always add a 'I don't remember' option

2015-10-01 23:13:27	@Espyo	#2
2015-10-01 23:13:31	@Espyo	actually, #1
2015-10-01 23:13:37	@Espyo	but for a different reason
2015-10-01 23:13:43	@Espyo	if a lot of Pikmin die, it's my fault
2015-10-01 23:13:48	@Espyo	I accept it and just rebuild my army
2015-10-01 23:13:52	@Espyo	not necessarily because it's easy
2015-10-01 23:14:16	Kazooie	good point
2015-10-01 23:14:26	@Espyo	good poll though
2015-10-01 23:14:32	Kazooie	now that I think about it that's actually a way better way to express it
2015-10-01 23:14:35	@Espyo	but for now, we need a poll that could maybe help shape Pikmin 4
2015-10-01 23:14:36	Kazooie	removing the first one
2015-10-01 23:14:41	Kazooie	yeah obviously

2015-10-01 23:17:30	Kazooie	yes
2015-10-01 23:18:00	Kazooie	'reminder' is a fun word to type
2015-10-01 23:18:09	Kazooie	so is 'pikmin'
2015-10-01 23:18:13	Kazooie	it's very fun to type

2015-10-02 19:08:59	@Espyo	but then again, "what" is probably the word I said the most while looking at Pikmin 2 things
2015-10-02 19:09:07	ScruffyChat	Haha yeah
2015-10-02 19:09:15	ScruffyChat	none of it makes sense
2015-10-02 19:09:41	@J	a load of the simpler tools seem to have fairly portable source code available
2015-10-02 19:09:42	ScruffyChat	I shouldn't be tackling the "naming" sections for treasures anyway, I can't connect internal name to actual treasure
2015-10-02 19:09:44	@Espyo	http://commadot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wtf.png
2015-10-02 19:09:46	@J	otherwise you could run a Windows VM
2015-10-02 19:09:51	@J	or Wine
2015-10-02 19:09:52	@Espyo	yeah, a lot of them should be simple
2015-10-02 19:09:58	Yoshi2	I wonder if that matrix system could be key in playing the bms files
2015-10-02 19:09:59	@Espyo	probably not so much stuff like BMDView2, though
2015-10-02 19:10:03	@Espyo	but extractors and all, sure
2015-10-02 19:10:12	@Espyo	it very well could
2015-10-02 19:10:13	@J	yes, that image is today
2015-10-02 19:10:17	@Espyo	let me see if I can find one of the files
2015-10-02 19:10:29	@J	I've been reviewing a huge amount of stuff done by a team in another country for a few days
2015-10-02 19:10:31	@J	so
2015-10-02 19:10:32	@J	many
2015-10-02 19:10:32	@Espyo	you wouldn't happen to remember what the files with the matrixes are, Scruffy?
2015-10-02 19:10:33	@J	craziness
2015-10-02 19:10:45	@Espyo	hey, I've been doing some code completion today too
2015-10-02 19:10:48	ScruffyChat	Let's see
2015-10-02 19:10:51	@Espyo	I always get tasked with fixing bugs or adding new features
2015-10-02 19:10:58	@Espyo	but today I had to complete someone else's code
2015-10-02 19:11:01	@Espyo	today and next week
2015-10-02 19:11:08	@Espyo	well... all I can say is that I've seen worse

2015-10-02 19:13:01	ScruffyChat	In Totaka
2015-10-02 19:13:10	@Espyo	thanks
2015-10-02 19:13:21	ScruffyChat	It's either TrackMap_Cond_T or TrackMap_Seq_T
2015-10-02 19:13:45	Yoshi2	you two talking about pikmin 2 hacking makes me want to work on my bms code again
2015-10-02 19:14:15	ScruffyChat	I know changing the column of six numbers can make certain mixes play all the time, although certain mixes supersede others
2015-10-02 19:14:41	ScruffyChat	Nothing I've changed in the matrix seems to have changed anything yet, but then again it's hard to measure something random
2015-10-02 19:15:32	ScruffyChat	I feel like I'm missing something, I feel like there should be Japanese text and my text editor is being dumb
2015-10-02 19:15:34	@J	oh, you actually managed to get the Dolphin 'run from filesystem' thing working?
2015-10-02 19:15:46	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-02 19:15:57	ScruffyChat	I fought an Emperor Bulblax in Sublevel 1 of the Emergence Cave
2015-10-02 19:16:05	@J	I meant Espyo, since he was having trouble with it before
2015-10-02 19:16:11	@Espyo	oh, can you get saves to work?
2015-10-02 19:16:28	@Espyo	yeah, I can get it to run, but a) it's only the US version, for some reason, and b) it still doesn't want to use the right saves
2015-10-02 19:16:41	@Espyo	Yoshi2: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/trackMap_Seq_T.txt https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/trackMap_Cond_T.txt
2015-10-02 19:16:47	@Espyo	good luck trying to decode those Egyptian artifacts
2015-10-02 19:17:06	ScruffyChat	I knew it
2015-10-02 19:17:15	ScruffyChat	My text editor can't even do Japanese text
2015-10-02 19:17:41	ScruffyChat	pikminêîââèoÉgÉâÉbÉNíËã is a nice read
2015-10-02 19:17:45	@Espyo	crud
2015-10-02 19:17:57	@Espyo	no good text editors on Mac?
2015-10-02 19:18:14	ScruffyChat	I guess not
2015-10-02 19:18:25	ScruffyChat	But Google Chrome can automatically translate Japanese
2015-10-02 19:18:27	@Espyo	there has to be something...
2015-10-02 19:18:36	ScruffyChat	To a degree
2015-10-02 19:18:43	ScruffyChat	The matrix is labeled "# Pikmin number of production track definition"
2015-10-02 19:18:52	@Espyo	yeah, not so useful
2015-10-02 19:18:56	@Espyo	oh!
2015-10-02 19:18:57	@Espyo	wait
2015-10-02 19:19:01	@Espyo	maybe if a lot of Pikmin die?
2015-10-02 19:19:06	ScruffyChat	Maybe!
2015-10-02 19:19:07	@Espyo	the instruments that stop? and when they stop?
2015-10-02 19:19:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-10-02 19:19:29	ScruffyChat	It's a matter of changing those numbers and testing it
2015-10-02 19:19:33	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-02 19:20:01	ScruffyChat	My save states don't work right; I've just been always starting the game at Emergence Cave sublevel 2
2015-10-02 19:20:15	ScruffyChat	Save states don't take into account the changes in code, for me
2015-10-02 19:20:23	@Espyo	same
2015-10-02 19:20:31	@Espyo	the game loads almost everything when it loads up at the start
2015-10-02 19:20:40	@Espyo	even stuff that makes no sense, like enemies
2015-10-02 19:20:46	@J	you might just have to change the encoding in your editor
2015-10-02 19:20:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-02 19:20:52	@Espyo	sure, it makes loading take less when it's time to load an area
2015-10-02 19:20:55	@J	I think everything is Shift-JIS
2015-10-02 19:21:04	@Espyo	but I'm surprised the GC has enough RAM to keep most of the game in memory
2015-10-02 19:21:10	@Espyo	yeah, Shift-JIS
2015-10-02 19:21:14	ScruffyChat	The GC is mysterious
2015-10-02 19:21:31	ScruffyChat	Apparently it had stereroscopic 3D functionality
2015-10-02 19:21:40	ScruffyChat	There were just never any 3d games
2015-10-02 19:21:48	Yoshi2	yup
2015-10-02 19:22:53	ScruffyChat	Espyo you're right
2015-10-02 19:23:12	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2015-10-02 19:23:18	@Espyo	off-topic, but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_zFhWdM4ic
2015-10-02 19:23:24	ScruffyChat	# "Pikmin number of production track definition" # Table is a sequence of track. # Please set to "1", the track that put the thinning-out process when Pikmin small number.
2015-10-02 19:25:18	ScruffyChat	So, even though its a really small musical effect that few would notice, every track had this big complex matrix for it
2015-10-02 19:25:50	@Espyo	seems that way
2015-10-02 19:25:55	@Espyo	they do that for a lot of things
2015-10-02 19:26:04	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 has so many tiny details nobody would ever notice
2015-10-02 19:32:01	ScruffyChat	Interesting subject, the Gaussian blur video
2015-10-02 19:32:40	ScruffyChat	Would any post-processing on a computer use that sort of method to calculate blur?
2015-10-02 19:32:57	ScruffyChat	For example, calculating it real-time in a video?
2015-10-02 19:33:24	@Espyo	probably, or probably something even easier
2015-10-02 19:33:37	@Espyo	but then again adding, multiplying and dividing is about as easy as you can get
2015-10-02 19:33:43	ScruffyChat	right
2015-10-02 19:34:12	ScruffyChat	It continually blows my mind that computers can do that 60 times a second, or sometimes more
2015-10-02 19:35:55	@J	I thought dividing was one of the slower instructions
2015-10-02 19:42:15	@Espyo	<ScruffyChat> It continually blows my mind that computers can do that 60 times a second, or sometimes more
2015-10-02 19:42:16	@Espyo	it did
2015-10-02 19:42:19	@Espyo	and then it didn't 
2015-10-02 19:42:21	@Espyo	and then it did again
2015-10-02 19:42:25	@Espyo	and then it just did the opposite
2015-10-02 19:42:28	@Espyo	and then did it even harder
2015-10-02 19:42:32	@Espyo	basically, now nothing makes sense
2015-10-02 19:42:47	@Espyo	on my engine, I see things being heavy when they shouldn't, and being light when they shouldn't
2015-10-02 19:42:57	@Espyo	now, if something's slow, I can't say "oh, I should tone down on X"
2015-10-02 19:43:04	@Espyo	I just say "russian roulette time"
2015-10-02 19:43:16	@Espyo	modern processors can divide pretty quickly
2015-10-02 19:43:23	@Espyo	but sure, compared to summing and all, it's slow
2015-10-02 19:49:09	Yoshi2	I had a lot of fun with packing a number as a double precision float
2015-10-02 19:49:25	Yoshi2	no idea how cpus can do it so quickly
2015-10-02 19:49:51	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-02 19:49:57	@Espyo	nothing makes sense in the world of performance
2015-10-02 20:09:36	@J	performance stuff is a lot more fun when your project consists of multiple languages, lots of networking/disk usage, and multiple processes on different machines
2015-10-02 20:11:48	@Espyo	*shiver*

2015-10-02 22:13:31	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-02 22:13:56	@PikFan	ok, so there's this weird thing in Formidable Oak
2015-10-02 22:14:43	@PikFan	when I go onto the radar at the beginning of the second day at the FO, and when I try panning to the top of the termite hill, it takes an unusually long time to get there
2015-10-02 22:15:09	@PikFan	the radar gets really slowed down for a second
2015-10-02 22:15:18	@PikFan	it's not fast and instantaneous
2015-10-02 22:15:50	@PikFan	but after a moment, everything is normal
2015-10-02 22:16:00	@Espyo	not quite sure I get it
2015-10-02 22:16:00	@PikFan	...this is exactly why I need a capture card
2015-10-02 22:16:17	@PikFan	it's really slowed down for a moment
2015-10-02 22:16:32	@PikFan	like, you know how the angle of the camera changes when you start panning?
2015-10-02 22:17:08	@PikFan	when I pan over to the top of the termite hill, it takes a moment for the angle to change
2015-10-02 22:17:16	@PikFan	it isn't instantaneous
2015-10-02 22:17:56	@Espyo	weird
2015-10-02 22:18:20	@PikFan	and as far as I know, this only happens on the second day at the FO
2015-10-02 22:18:32	@PikFan	and also before the Plasm Wraith fight starts

2015-10-03 00:21:50	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-03 00:32:53	ScruffyChat	Hi PikFan
2015-10-03 00:33:06	@PikFan	hey Scruffy
2015-10-03 00:33:30	ScruffyChat	I got your suggestions about the Infernal EB; I'll work on them right away
2015-10-03 00:33:38	@PikFan	thank you for making the Infernal Emperor Bulblax—right
2015-10-03 00:33:47	ScruffyChat	Of course
2015-10-03 00:33:54	ScruffyChat	It was really fun to make
2015-10-03 00:34:01	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-03 00:34:14	@PikFan	the way you rendered the tongue, it got me thinking
2015-10-03 00:34:20	@PikFan	what if the tongue is lava
2015-10-03 00:34:26	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-03 00:34:29	@PikFan	and when it licks, it spreads lava on the floor
2015-10-03 00:34:39	ScruffyChat	And it can just wield lava arounud
2015-10-03 00:34:46	ScruffyChat	That would be a pretty useful tongue
2015-10-03 00:34:55	ScruffyChat	You wouldn't have to cook food
2015-10-03 00:35:05	@PikFan	you'd just... absorb it
2015-10-03 00:35:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 00:35:38	@PikFan	but yeah, that would be a good attack along with its other attacks
2015-10-03 00:35:42	@PikFan	have you read its page?
2015-10-03 00:35:45	ScruffyChat	But cool, I can make the tongue lava
2015-10-03 00:35:46	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-03 00:35:51	ScruffyChat	It's got a lot of neat attacks
2015-10-03 00:35:57	ScruffyChat	It sounds like a tough boss
2015-10-03 00:35:57	@PikFan	indeed
2015-10-03 00:36:02	@PikFan	it's meant to be a tough boss
2015-10-03 00:36:19	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 00:36:26	ScruffyChat	At what point do you fight it again?
2015-10-03 00:36:41	@PikFan	one of the caves in the Great Volcano
2015-10-03 00:36:53	@PikFan	but considering I'm removing the great volcano...
2015-10-03 00:37:17	@PikFan	hm, I might move it to one of the Distant Desert or Ancient Valley caves
2015-10-03 00:37:43	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-03 00:38:00	ScruffyChat	I always found it cool to venture so far underground you hit lava
2015-10-03 00:38:07	ScruffyChat	Well, not cool....
2015-10-03 00:38:24	@PikFan	funny you mention that, there's an article about that
2015-10-03 00:38:39	@PikFan	http://pikminfanon.com/Pit_of_100_Trials
2015-10-03 00:38:50	@PikFan	er, lowercase t

2015-10-03 00:58:33	ScruffyChat	Also 39 is funny
2015-10-03 00:58:47	@PikFan	yeah, it is
2015-10-03 00:59:03	@PikFan	there's a Pikmin sidescrolling game somewhere on the wiki
2015-10-03 00:59:12	@PikFan	I think it's called Pikmin Adventure
2015-10-03 00:59:27	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-03 00:59:51	ScruffyChat	I remember trying to think of how turn-based battle would work in Pikmin
2015-10-03 01:49:04	@PikFan	hey Scruffy
2015-10-03 01:49:39	@PikFan	was the collection of metal inspired by Occupational Hazards?
2015-10-03 01:55:20	ScruffyChat	No, I don't have the short films, I wish I did
2015-10-03 01:55:30	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-03 01:55:46	ScruffyChat	But I thought, what's like treasure but not treasure, but still occurs more regularly than pristine, unblemished fruit
2015-10-03 01:56:09	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-03 01:56:20	ScruffyChat	And I figured metal could be used for some other purpose than monetary, so I looked it up
2015-10-03 01:56:47	ScruffyChat	And it turns out metal powder (specifically iron and boron) can be 5 times as efficient as petroleum as a fuel source
2015-10-03 01:57:02	@PikFan	I decided to watch Occupational Hazards again last night, and when I saw Pikmin collecting all those metal pieces, it very much so reminded me of your game
2015-10-03 01:57:09	@PikFan	really? how does that work?
2015-10-03 01:57:26	ScruffyChat	Metal in a particulate form becomes much more reactive
2015-10-03 01:57:56	ScruffyChat	I suppose since its tensile strength has to apply over a very small surface area
2015-10-03 01:58:32	ScruffyChat	And like gasoline it can react under pressure to produce a great deal of energy
2015-10-03 01:58:49	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-03 01:58:56	ScruffyChat	But unlike gasoline, metal powder is not used up in a reaction; metal can be used over and over again
2015-10-03 01:59:10	@PikFan	wait
2015-10-03 01:59:23	ScruffyChat	(I account for this in the game by the metal chamber being broken as it is borrowed from Olimar's crashed ship
2015-10-03 01:59:26	@PikFan	so it combusts, but it's not used up?
2015-10-03 01:59:30	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-03 01:59:36	ScruffyChat	It's reusable many times
2015-10-03 01:59:57	ScruffyChat	The only crushing problem is that it's heavy
2015-10-03 02:00:19	@PikFan	I don't understand how it could combust, but I also don't understand how it can be reused
2015-10-03 02:00:36	@PikFan	because combustion is an exothermic reaction
2015-10-03 02:00:46	@PikFan	so something has to be used up
2015-10-03 02:02:14	ScruffyChat	That's why it's not in cars right now
2015-10-03 02:02:31	@PikFan	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_explosion
2015-10-03 02:02:33	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2015-10-03 02:02:34	ScruffyChat	It needs a significant heat source, maybe 2000 degrees C
2015-10-03 02:02:40	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-10-03 02:03:02	ScruffyChat	it's in some rockets
2015-10-03 02:03:05	ScruffyChat	But not in cars yet
2015-10-03 02:03:15	ScruffyChat	We're talking particles a few nanometers across
2015-10-03 02:03:35	ScruffyChat	And once they're burned, treating them with hydrogen can make them burnable again
2015-10-03 02:04:13	ScruffyChat	Otherwise, it's a pollutant-free process
2015-10-03 02:04:28	@PikFan	wait, this is the same thing as gunpowder
2015-10-03 02:04:32	ScruffyChat	It just takes a lot of energy and weighs a lot
2015-10-03 02:04:36	@PikFan	just on the nanoscale
2015-10-03 02:04:42	ScruffyChat	oh yeah, I guess so
2015-10-03 02:04:50	ScruffyChat	Huh, I never really thought of it like that
2015-10-03 02:05:03	@PikFan	well, that makes a little more sense
2015-10-03 02:06:10	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 02:56:44	@PikFan	oh, Scruffy
2015-10-03 02:57:02	@PikFan	you should do a size comparison of the Lunar Long Legs with something

2015-10-03 03:24:51	ScruffyChat	to show up
2015-10-03 03:25:36	@PikFan	perhaps another arachnorb or boss enemy
2015-10-03 03:26:57	@PikFan	in the meantime, I'm wondering how to adapt Pikipedia's enemy stats template to fanon
2015-10-03 03:27:42	@PikFan	you've been following the proper way of making enemy articles
2015-10-03 03:27:53	@PikFan	but it just feels jarring without that essential enemy info
2015-10-03 03:29:55	@PikFan	maybe I needn't make a template, we can just use regular tables
2015-10-03 03:30:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I feel like the infobox right at the beginning of the article is essential, it directs attention
2015-10-03 03:30:36	@PikFan	I'll discuss this with Espyo tomorrow
2015-10-03 03:31:07	@PikFan	I for the life of me can't make a complex template without help

2015-10-03 04:05:29	@PikFan	I figured out the Bulblax's weakness
2015-10-03 04:05:48	@PikFan	you have to get it to walk into the patches of lava and wait for the lava to cool
2015-10-03 04:06:28	@PikFan	it makes the boss stuck, so you can attack it without it walking away or jumping
2015-10-03 04:09:18	ScruffyChat	Nice
2015-10-03 04:09:36	@PikFan	it's a good alternative for bomb rocks, which don't work against it
2015-10-03 04:09:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 04:09:59	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing it would eventually free itself though
2015-10-03 04:10:03	@PikFan	yep
2015-10-03 04:10:07	@PikFan	quickly, actually
2015-10-03 04:10:19	@PikFan	I'm thinking a time window of 7-10 seconds
2015-10-03 04:10:30	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-03 04:10:31	@PikFan	hm, that might be too short
2015-10-03 04:10:42	ScruffyChat	Yeah I'd say 10-12
2015-10-03 04:10:51	ScruffyChat	or even to 15
2015-10-03 04:11:14	ScruffyChat	That's around the stun time for the Vehemoth Phosbat or Scornet Maestro
2015-10-03 04:11:26	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-03 04:11:34	ScruffyChat	Although damage supersedes time
2015-10-03 04:12:17	@PikFan	right, the Scornet Maestro only take up to a quarter health per stun

2015-10-03 05:49:41	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-03 05:49:51	@PikFan	ooh, you even rendered the Beady Long Legs
2015-10-03 05:50:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 05:50:16	ScruffyChat	And the poor little Blue Pikmin
2015-10-03 05:50:58	@PikFan	actually, the Lunar Long Legs might be too small
2015-10-03 05:51:03	ScruffyChat	Really, this comparison makes the LLL look smaller than I previously figured
2015-10-03 05:51:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 05:51:25	@PikFan	because I imagine seeing 100 Pikmin, and...
2015-10-03 05:51:34	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-03 05:51:41	ScruffyChat	Bigger is better
2015-10-03 05:51:46	ScruffyChat	I'll fix that right now
2015-10-03 05:52:01	@PikFan	isn't the LLL bigger than Onion moons anyway?
2015-10-03 05:52:44	@PikFan	also, may want to make the BLL a bit bigger, too
2015-10-03 05:53:36	ScruffyChat	You're right, its head is supposed to be as big as an Onion moon
2015-10-03 05:53:51	ScruffyChat	I just don't want the feet to get too big
2015-10-03 05:53:59	@PikFan	true
2015-10-03 05:54:36	ScruffyChat	Although, if the feet were big enough, it could change the gameplay
2015-10-03 05:54:47	@PikFan	how so?
2015-10-03 05:55:04	ScruffyChat	As in, you have to wait for one of its feet to rest and then somehow climb on it and have Pikmin and leaders climb the legs
2015-10-03 05:55:10	ScruffyChat	I don't know, just brainstorming
2015-10-03 05:56:12	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-10-03 05:56:25	@PikFan	kinda like Megaleg
2015-10-03 05:56:58	ScruffyChat	yeah!
2015-10-03 05:57:11	ScruffyChat	So its legs would be like climbing stick
2015-10-03 05:57:14	ScruffyChat	sticks*
2015-10-03 05:57:18	@PikFan	right
2015-10-03 05:57:23	ScruffyChat	I don't know how leaders would get up there though
2015-10-03 05:57:59	@PikFan	maybe they could climb, too
2015-10-03 05:58:05	ScruffyChat	I guess so
2015-10-03 05:58:09	@PikFan	if the legs were mossy
2015-10-03 05:58:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 05:58:38	ScruffyChat	I guess that'll be a new feature, since I'll have to introduce it earlier in the gaem
2015-10-03 05:58:44	ScruffyChat	Game*
2015-10-03 05:58:57	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-03 05:59:03	ScruffyChat	Leaders (and I guess Pikmin) can climb mossy surfaces
2015-10-03 05:59:10	ScruffyChat	Otherwise that sort of comes out of nowhere
2015-10-03 05:59:17	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-03 05:59:26	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-03 05:59:35	@PikFan	would Lichen Pikmin be able to climb up, too?
2015-10-03 05:59:50	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-03 05:59:59	ScruffyChat	All types should climb
2015-10-03 06:00:14	@PikFan	oh, right, of course
2015-10-03 06:00:29	@PikFan	Lichen Pikmin THEMSELVES are moss, in a way
2015-10-03 06:00:36	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:00:39	@PikFan	I just misinterpreted that they clean up moss :P
2015-10-03 06:00:45	ScruffyChat	hehe
2015-10-03 06:01:08	ScruffyChat	Maybe, since it will take Pikmin Forever to climb the legs, it could just be a cutscene
2015-10-03 06:01:26	@PikFan	true
2015-10-03 06:01:37	ScruffyChat	Like, once you reach the legs, it prompts you to climb, and then you don't have to sit there and wait for all of them to climb
2015-10-03 06:01:45	@PikFan	but personally I like the idea of captains climbing
2015-10-03 06:01:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:01:51	ScruffyChat	Me too
2015-10-03 06:01:57	ScruffyChat	I could keep it in the main game
2015-10-03 06:01:58	@PikFan	the cutscene idea is good, too
2015-10-03 06:02:02	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:02:11	ScruffyChat	It'd be like switching sub-areas in P3
2015-10-03 06:02:23	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-03 06:02:29	ScruffyChat	It just wipes to black and then back again, maybe
2015-10-03 06:02:39	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-03 06:02:45	ScruffyChat	Or, maybe not
2015-10-03 06:02:50	ScruffyChat	That takes out some of the action
2015-10-03 06:03:03	@PikFan	yeah, that just seems bland
2015-10-03 06:03:04	ScruffyChat	yeah, I guess it'll just show the leaders and Pikmin climbing
2015-10-03 06:04:07	ScruffyChat	Okay so a real-time cutscene in which you and your Pikmin climb up the legs
2015-10-03 06:04:22	@PikFan	sounds good
2015-10-03 06:04:26	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-03 06:04:47	@PikFan	and I can imagine tense music playing while they're climbing u[
2015-10-03 06:04:50	@PikFan	*up
2015-10-03 06:04:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:05:04	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna end up composing all this
2015-10-03 06:05:13	@PikFan	I know
2015-10-03 06:05:27	@PikFan	I'm excited though :D
2015-10-03 06:05:39	ScruffyChat	Thanks! :)
2015-10-03 06:05:59	ScruffyChat	I already have an idea for the Lipidon's music (inspired by Giant Breadbug's music) that I want to try out before going to bed
2015-10-03 06:06:10	ScruffyChat	But first I'll finish this size comparison
2015-10-03 06:06:15	@PikFan	hm, alright
2015-10-03 06:06:57	ScruffyChat	This thing could squish a Beady Long Legs with one stomp, it could fit all of one BLL under its foot
2015-10-03 06:07:24	@PikFan	friendly fire much
2015-10-03 06:07:32	@PikFan	or rather, friendly stomping
2015-10-03 06:07:50	ScruffyChat	Haha yeah
2015-10-03 06:08:14	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-03 06:08:20	@PikFan	maybe there could be a BLL
2015-10-03 06:08:21	ScruffyChat	Really anything but the big bosses in P3 could fit under its foot
2015-10-03 06:08:27	@PikFan	and then BOOM
2015-10-03 06:08:32	@PikFan	gets squished by the LLL
2015-10-03 06:08:40	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-10-03 06:08:43	ScruffyChat	That'd be something
2015-10-03 06:08:51	@PikFan	as a way to introduce the boss
2015-10-03 06:09:04	ScruffyChat	And the stomp would just echo and echo
2015-10-03 06:09:12	ScruffyChat	That's great
2015-10-03 06:09:20	@PikFan	and then you'd see the main body rise out of the ground
2015-10-03 06:09:27	@PikFan	perfect
2015-10-03 06:09:44	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-10-03 06:09:54	@PikFan	oh, I finished expanding the Infernal EB
2015-10-03 06:10:03	ScruffyChat	I won't dare render that though, not with this computer
2015-10-03 06:10:05	ScruffyChat	Oh cool
2015-10-03 06:10:20	@PikFan	what kind of computer do you have?
2015-10-03 06:10:53	ScruffyChat	Macbook Pro
2015-10-03 06:11:04	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-10-03 06:11:11	ScruffyChat	It's good, but I don't have the processor that can handle renders like that
2015-10-03 06:11:16	@PikFan	right
2015-10-03 06:11:21	@PikFan	if only you had a desktop
2015-10-03 06:11:23	ScruffyChat	I mean, it COULD happen, but it'd take several overnights
2015-10-03 06:11:26	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:11:45	@PikFan	it's already taking super long to render the prologue
2015-10-03 06:12:03	ScruffyChat	Well, I have tricks to reduce the render time
2015-10-03 06:12:10	ScruffyChat	But finding the time to work on it is the problem
2015-10-03 06:12:20	@PikFan	that's unfortunate
2015-10-03 06:12:27	ScruffyChat	It's alright
2015-10-03 06:12:40	ScruffyChat	Requests are, to me, more of a priority, and they go faster
2015-10-03 06:12:55	ScruffyChat	Blender can only render one project at a time, so better to get the short ones out of the way
2015-10-03 06:13:29	@PikFan	you're so selfless
2015-10-03 06:14:01	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-03 06:14:29	@PikFan	well, I have to say, I like how IEB turned out
2015-10-03 06:14:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:14:48	@PikFan	both the page and the image
2015-10-03 06:14:52	ScruffyChat	Your article is really descriptive
2015-10-03 06:14:57	@PikFan	thank you
2015-10-03 06:15:03	ScruffyChat	My only question is about 35000 HP
2015-10-03 06:15:17	ScruffyChat	How much strength is the average Pikmin in your game?
2015-10-03 06:15:28	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-10-03 06:15:54	@PikFan	normal Pikmin hit is 10, Reds are 12, and Purples are 15
2015-10-03 06:16:00	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-03 06:16:03	@PikFan	same as the canon games, I think
2015-10-03 06:16:18	@PikFan	I'll check
2015-10-03 06:16:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it just seems that it might take more than one day to bring it down
2015-10-03 06:16:32	ScruffyChat	Pikmin enemies never exceed 10000 I think
2015-10-03 06:16:35	@PikFan	possibly
2015-10-03 06:16:44	ScruffyChat	Except the formidable Honeywisp, at 99999 HP!
2015-10-03 06:16:47	@PikFan	actually, the original Emperor Bulblax is 30000
2015-10-03 06:16:50	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-03 06:16:59	ScruffyChat	Oh, well in that case go for it
2015-10-03 06:17:06	@PikFan	and even then, you see how fast people take it down
2015-10-03 06:17:09	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-03 06:17:16	ScruffyChat	Man, my wimpy LLL is only 10000
2015-10-03 06:17:27	ScruffyChat	What a teddy bear
2015-10-03 06:17:28	@PikFan	same as a Raging LL?
2015-10-03 06:17:36	ScruffyChat	You're right
2015-10-03 06:17:45	ScruffyChat	Okay, that can't stand any longer
2015-10-03 06:17:55	@PikFan	hehe
2015-10-03 06:17:56	ScruffyChat	at least 15000
2015-10-03 06:18:01	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-03 06:18:10	ScruffyChat	I just figured, it's difficult to get to a weak point
2015-10-03 06:18:21	@PikFan	maybe in my game, there should be a number under the health wheel
2015-10-03 06:18:28	@PikFan	or something
2015-10-03 06:18:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:18:46	@PikFan	oh, I should add locking-on in my controls
2015-10-03 06:18:57	@PikFan	I want to combine regular swarming and charging
2015-10-03 06:19:04	ScruffyChat	I haven't even added controls yet
2015-10-03 06:19:04	@PikFan	I liked both concepts
2015-10-03 06:19:12	ScruffyChat	But I won't allow locking on to the LLL
2015-10-03 06:19:18	@PikFan	now that you mention it, you haven't
2015-10-03 06:19:26	@PikFan	yeah, cause it's so huge
2015-10-03 06:19:37	ScruffyChat	However powerful consoles get, that would crash the gaem
2015-10-03 06:19:38	@PikFan	well, maybe you could lock onto its exposed parts
2015-10-03 06:19:44	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-03 06:20:13	ScruffyChat	And each exposed part would show a health wheel
2015-10-03 06:20:24	@PikFan	mhm
2015-10-03 06:20:34	@PikFan	what would be the maximum for an exposed part?
2015-10-03 06:20:42	@PikFan	*maximum health
2015-10-03 06:21:10	@PikFan	brb
2015-10-03 06:21:14	ScruffyChat	They'd all show the same health wheel, the one for the whole object
2015-10-03 06:21:15	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-03 06:23:44	@PikFan	back
2015-10-03 06:24:47	ScruffyChat	hey
2015-10-03 06:24:48	@PikFan	oh, so they don't have individual health wheels?
2015-10-03 06:24:57	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it's all for the one creature
2015-10-03 06:25:05	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-03 06:25:16	ScruffyChat	Or do you think it should be each individual?
2015-10-03 06:25:24	ScruffyChat	And when you defeat them, they stop glowing
2015-10-03 06:25:55	@PikFan	well, there needs to be some way to let you know that you're depleting the health of each part
2015-10-03 06:26:07	@PikFan	so... maybe individual health wheels
2015-10-03 06:26:08	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-03 06:26:16	@PikFan	and then a big health wheel somewhere else
2015-10-03 06:26:51	ScruffyChat	The only problem I have with that is that it's less like a Pikmin fight and more like a Bowser fight, where instead of one continuous battle it's a set number of little hits you have to pull off
2015-10-03 06:27:12	@PikFan	oh, I see what you mean
2015-10-03 06:27:46	@PikFan	maybe at some point during the battle, a creature comes out of the body, and the true final battle begins
2015-10-03 06:27:53	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-03 06:28:00	@PikFan	so that you're actually 1 on 1
2015-10-03 06:28:09	ScruffyChat	I guess
2015-10-03 06:28:22	ScruffyChat	I feel like this is already as climactic as it can get though
2015-10-03 06:28:28	ScruffyChat	Where the enemy is also the terrain
2015-10-03 06:28:47	@PikFan	hmmmm...
2015-10-03 06:28:58	ScruffyChat	Well not as climactic as it can get, but should get?
2015-10-03 06:29:08	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-10-03 06:29:25	@PikFan	ah, if only En Passant were here
2015-10-03 06:29:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:29:38	ScruffyChat	I do like the idea of something coming out of it
2015-10-03 06:29:44	ScruffyChat	I just don't know what
2015-10-03 06:30:00	ScruffyChat	What could come out of an Arachnorb that isn't another Arachnorb?
2015-10-03 06:30:03	ScruffyChat	Besides Mitites
2015-10-03 06:30:10	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-10-03 06:30:37	ScruffyChat	Euugh, maybe a 100-Mitite mass
2015-10-03 06:30:53	@PikFan	eeww
2015-10-03 06:31:05	@PikFan	eeeh...
2015-10-03 06:31:08	ScruffyChat	I can't even imagine, all the crawling sounds
2015-10-03 06:31:22	ScruffyChat	The sound designer for P2 was a genius
2015-10-03 06:31:28	@PikFan	well, we don't need people to be grossed out during the final battle
2015-10-03 06:31:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:32:05	@PikFan	but what if...
2015-10-03 06:32:10	@PikFan	you could fight...
2015-10-03 06:32:16	@PikFan	inside
2015-10-03 06:32:33	ScruffyChat	woah
2015-10-03 06:32:35	ScruffyChat	Fight the core
2015-10-03 06:32:46	@PikFan	yeah, fight the true essence
2015-10-03 06:33:04	@PikFan	but then... where'd Edward be?
2015-10-03 06:33:17	ScruffyChat	I have no idea
2015-10-03 06:33:30	ScruffyChat	Okay okay, how bout this
2015-10-03 06:33:44	ScruffyChat	After you beat enough health, a hole is revealed, like a cave
2015-10-03 06:33:58	ScruffyChat	And the cave is the inside of the LLL
2015-10-03 06:34:22	ScruffyChat	And there are enemies in the cave and hazards and everything
2015-10-03 06:34:33	ScruffyChat	The only difference is that its all spherical
2015-10-03 06:34:40	ScruffyChat	And of course it can be bigger on the inside
2015-10-03 06:34:51	@PikFan	because yay broken logic
2015-10-03 06:35:02	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-03 06:35:16	ScruffyChat	And you have to fight your way to the core and destroy it
2015-10-03 06:35:53	ScruffyChat	And Edward... could be trapped in a web inside the LLL
2015-10-03 06:36:01	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-03 06:36:04	ScruffyChat	That's right, it weaves webs inside itself
2015-10-03 06:36:34	ScruffyChat	And once the core is destroyed, you have to free Edward and take the final geyser out
2015-10-03 06:36:44	@PikFan	then would the core be... a giant Arachnode?!
2015-10-03 06:36:50	ScruffyChat	Yesssss
2015-10-03 06:36:59	ScruffyChat	We have a winner
2015-10-03 06:37:10	ScruffyChat	That sounds awesome
2015-10-03 06:37:22	@PikFan	I like this
2015-10-03 06:37:24	@PikFan	very much
2015-10-03 06:37:44	ScruffyChat	that's like a tesseract of all Pikmin gameplay
2015-10-03 06:37:58	@PikFan	tesseract
2015-10-03 06:38:09	@PikFan	but we're not in the fourth dimension...
2015-10-03 06:38:15	@PikFan	or are we
2015-10-03 06:38:18	ScruffyChat	No, it's just a metaphor
2015-10-03 06:38:24	@PikFan	no, I know
2015-10-03 06:38:30	@PikFan	I'm just teasing :P
2015-10-03 06:38:34	ScruffyChat	I don't want to get into representing spacetime... yet
2015-10-03 06:38:43	@PikFan	you already did
2015-10-03 06:38:49	@PikFan	with the Chronos Reactor
2015-10-03 06:38:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:39:03	ScruffyChat	It's hilarious
2015-10-03 06:39:19	ScruffyChat	But anyway
2015-10-03 06:39:29	@PikFan	anyway, yeah, so what kinds of attacks would the giant Arachnode have?
2015-10-03 06:39:29	ScruffyChat	Thank you so much! That is just what this boss needs
2015-10-03 06:39:39	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure yet
2015-10-03 06:39:42	@PikFan	you're welcome! I'm happy to help
2015-10-03 06:39:53	ScruffyChat	It should glow purple like the outside
2015-10-03 06:40:22	@PikFan	oooh
2015-10-03 06:40:36	ScruffyChat	Since the ground is a sphere, maybe the web it travels in should be a sphere shape
2015-10-03 06:40:54	ScruffyChat	Maybe it's just a big glob of web
2015-10-03 06:41:09	ScruffyChat	Like an inner core made of spiderweb
2015-10-03 06:41:28	ScruffyChat	And the Arachnode can smash it onto the ground
2015-10-03 06:41:49	@PikFan	so the Arachnode is harassing you while you're advancing towards it?
2015-10-03 06:42:17	ScruffyChat	I guess so
2015-10-03 06:42:31	@PikFan	er, wait, I misinterpreted that
2015-10-03 06:42:31	ScruffyChat	Well, maybe that's too much to think about at once
2015-10-03 06:42:43	@PikFan	I realized you meant during the actual battle
2015-10-03 06:42:53	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-10-03 06:42:59	@PikFan	ah okay
2015-10-03 06:43:11	ScruffyChat	So I suppose there are sublevels inside the LLL
2015-10-03 06:43:30	ScruffyChat	And your Onion and research pod will follow you inside
2015-10-03 06:43:31	@PikFan	this would compensate for the lack of caves in the Canyon of Moonlight
2015-10-03 06:43:35	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-03 06:43:39	ScruffyChat	Very true
2015-10-03 06:43:48	@PikFan	actually, no
2015-10-03 06:43:48	ScruffyChat	I'm so excited about this
2015-10-03 06:44:02	@PikFan	if there were sublevels, then the excitement might die down
2015-10-03 06:44:21	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-03 06:44:38	ScruffyChat	Okay, so one big cave that leads up to the Arachnode
2015-10-03 06:44:45	@PikFan	not big, even
2015-10-03 06:44:49	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-03 06:44:53	ScruffyChat	Just condensed
2015-10-03 06:44:56	@PikFan	like, a few obstacles and enemies
2015-10-03 06:45:00	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-10-03 06:45:10	ScruffyChat	And then the battle
2015-10-03 06:45:10	@PikFan	and all the while, Edward and the Arachnode are in view
2015-10-03 06:45:19	ScruffyChat	Oh, that's good
2015-10-03 06:45:22	@PikFan	...maybe
2015-10-03 06:45:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah, considering the camera I don't know if that'd work
2015-10-03 06:45:52	ScruffyChat	The fixed cameras in P3 were a bit annoying
2015-10-03 06:45:59	@PikFan	ugh
2015-10-03 06:46:08	@PikFan	I can't agree with you enough on that
2015-10-03 06:47:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:47:35	ScruffyChat	So maybe no fixed camera, but you can see the shadow of the web the whole time
2015-10-03 06:47:44	@PikFan	good fix
2015-10-03 06:47:52	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-03 06:47:57	@PikFan	and the movements of something large every now and then
2015-10-03 06:48:02	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:48:06	@PikFan	to indicate the Arachnode
2015-10-03 06:48:09	ScruffyChat	Like how the Phosbat was staged
2015-10-03 06:48:18	@PikFan	mhm
2015-10-03 06:48:32	ScruffyChat	okay, so now all that's left is what the boss can actually do
2015-10-03 06:48:39	@PikFan	I'm thinking that you'd start at the top, and then spiral down towards the bottom
2015-10-03 06:48:53	ScruffyChat	How do you mean?
2015-10-03 06:49:19	@PikFan	so, let's say that when you're on the outside, the hole appears at the top
2015-10-03 06:49:30	@PikFan	so you go inside, you're still at the top
2015-10-03 06:49:38	@PikFan	the underside of the top? I'm not sure
2015-10-03 06:49:43	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-03 06:49:48	@PikFan	but then, you descend towards the bottom
2015-10-03 06:49:52	ScruffyChat	No you'd be on the top of a smaller sphere inside
2015-10-03 06:49:59	@PikFan	OH
2015-10-03 06:50:20	ScruffyChat	Because even inside a planet gravity pulls toward the center
2015-10-03 06:50:28	@PikFan	right, the inside can't be completely hollow
2015-10-03 06:50:31	@PikFan	and also that
2015-10-03 06:51:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 06:51:23	ScruffyChat	But hollow enough that you can see where you're going
2015-10-03 06:51:40	ScruffyChat	It's not a stretch when you think about how P2 caves were designed
2015-10-03 06:51:51	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-10-03 06:51:57	ScruffyChat	It's so weird to think how low of a ceiling those caves could have had
2015-10-03 06:59:16	@PikFan	indeed
2015-10-03 06:59:21	@PikFan	sorry, got distracted
2015-10-03 06:59:27	ScruffyChat	No prob
2015-10-03 06:59:32	@PikFan	and wow, it's just about 2 am for you
2015-10-03 06:59:44	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I should probably sleep on this
2015-10-03 06:59:56	@PikFan	these are a lot of good ideas
2015-10-03 07:00:01	@PikFan	it's a lot to take it
2015-10-03 07:00:03	@PikFan	*in
2015-10-03 07:00:10	ScruffyChat	yeah! I'm really excited to put it all together
2015-10-03 07:00:25	@PikFan	this is going to be good
2015-10-03 07:00:32	ScruffyChat	You fight a boss, that is also a planet, that is also its own cave with its own boss
2015-10-03 07:00:45	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-10-03 07:00:48	@PikFan	epicness
2015-10-03 07:00:52	ScruffyChat	Indeed
2015-10-03 07:01:00	ScruffyChat	Thank you again for all your ideas
2015-10-03 07:01:06	@PikFan	of course
2015-10-03 07:01:20	ScruffyChat	I ought to give you some credit in the LLL article once it's expanded
2015-10-03 07:01:36	@PikFan	oh, you don't have to...
2015-10-03 07:01:54	ScruffyChat	ok
2015-10-03 07:01:59	ScruffyChat	Well still, kudos to you
2015-10-03 07:02:05	@PikFan	but if you want to, then alright
2015-10-03 07:02:08	ScruffyChat	What do you think of "Arachlord"
2015-10-03 07:02:14	@PikFan	and thank you for your services

2015-10-03 07:03:56	ScruffyChat	It's a pleasure, really
2015-10-03 07:03:58	@PikFan	so you have my highest respect
2015-10-03 07:04:05	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-03 07:04:37	@PikFan	anyway, yeah, it's been fun talking tonight
2015-10-03 07:04:41	@PikFan	you should get some sleep
2015-10-03 07:04:44	ScruffyChat	yeah!
2015-10-03 07:04:46	ScruffyChat	And yeah.
2015-10-03 07:05:00	@PikFan	I'll ask Espyo what he thinks and maybe En Passant if he's on tomorrow
2015-10-03 07:05:09	ScruffyChat	Cool, thanks!
2015-10-03 07:05:14	@PikFan	yep
2015-10-03 07:05:19	ScruffyChat	Have a good night!

2015-10-03 14:58:28	@Espyo	hey
2015-10-03 14:59:23	Yoshi2	I completely forgot that today was a holiday in germany
2015-10-03 14:59:36	Yoshi2	wasted a lot of time when I went to town
2015-10-03 15:00:20	@Espyo	hehe
2015-10-03 15:00:28	@Espyo	apparently it's a holiday on monday
2015-10-03 15:00:32	@Espyo	but I'm not sure if I work or not
2015-10-03 15:00:36	@Espyo	it's like
2015-10-03 15:00:49	@Espyo	it used to be a big holiday, but the government made it so people have to work on it anyway
2015-10-03 15:01:00	@Espyo	but my company's not a fan of it, so they give their employees a lot of redacted holidays anyway
2015-10-03 15:01:09	@Espyo	but I forgot to check my schedule yesterday
2015-10-03 15:01:24	@Espyo	so... I might just go there just to head back home
2015-10-03 15:23:34	Chiaki_Nanami	Isn't it reunification day in Germany today?

2015-10-03 15:25:06	Yoshi2	I knew it was on the third october
2015-10-03 15:25:21	Yoshi2	I just didn't think it was today
2015-10-03 15:25:33	Chiaki_Nanami	and today is kanelbullens dag

2015-10-03 17:16:16	@Espyo	wait, depends on the area
2015-10-03 17:16:23	@Espyo	as a computer engineer, actually feasible
2015-10-03 17:16:30	@Espyo	otherwise, over a year to find any job
2015-10-03 17:16:46	@Espyo	my sister's been trying for a year, she finally got SOMETHING

2015-10-03 17:49:57	En_Passant	It looks like it's missing its upper eyelids, though
2015-10-03 17:55:00	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-03 17:55:09	ScruffyChat	Well, I guess so
2015-10-03 17:56:06	ScruffyChat	It has upper eyelids, its eyes are just really open
2015-10-03 17:56:27	ScruffyChat	If you zoom in they just barely grace the top
2015-10-03 17:56:31	ScruffyChat	I can fix that though
2015-10-03 17:58:01	En_Passant	In the artwork from previous games, its eyes are barely visible beneath its many layers of eyelid
2015-10-03 17:58:26	En_Passant	It squints in superiority
2015-10-03 18:03:17	ScruffyChat	Ah, you're right
2015-10-03 18:03:47	ScruffyChat	I was just going off of the game artwork
2015-10-03 18:08:35	ScruffyChat	Do you think I should make any other changes?
2015-10-03 18:09:01	En_Passant	Is there a reason the tongue is round?
2015-10-03 18:17:17	ScruffyChat	It's twisting to the side

2015-10-03 18:18:03	ScruffyChat	I used this as reference
2015-10-03 18:23:09	En_Passant	The shading doesn't reflect that very well
2015-10-03 18:23:21	En_Passant	And the vein in the tongue doesn't seen to twist with it
2015-10-03 18:23:33	En_Passant	That's what it looks like to me
2015-10-03 18:23:35	ScruffyChat	Ah, I see
2015-10-03 18:28:50	En_Passant	The skin color doesn't match the darker tan the Grub-dogs got in P3, as well

2015-10-03 23:11:41	ScruffyChat	It's alright though, the storm doesn't seem bad for the time being
2015-10-03 23:11:55	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-03 23:12:59	ScruffyChat	I see you got enemy stats working on Pikmin Fnaon
2015-10-03 23:13:01	ScruffyChat	Fanon*
2015-10-03 23:13:08	@PikFan	kinda
2015-10-03 23:13:24	@PikFan	I didn't make a template, I just used a regular table
2015-10-03 23:13:40	ScruffyChat	Well that's okay, it still looks good
2015-10-03 23:13:45	@PikFan	right
2015-10-03 23:14:07	@PikFan	but in case other users want to use it, in case they don't want an infobox...
2015-10-03 23:14:10	@PikFan	say, Espyo
2015-10-03 23:14:30	@PikFan	how difficult would it be for you to make a fanon version of {{enemy stats}}?

2015-10-03 23:18:12	ScruffyChat	But also the template is designed to take into account the HP systems of the actual games
2015-10-03 23:18:32	ScruffyChat	I'd imagine, since an enemy's HP is only the number we give it, the template would be simpler
2015-10-03 23:18:53	Testyo	though if we could get EU isn't a single colour
2015-10-03 23:20:27	@PikFan	the only issue I see with making a fanon template is that users that made a new game probably wouldn't add theirs to the template
2015-10-03 23:20:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-03 23:20:48	@PikFan	because a) they don't even know it exists or b) they're too intimidated to
2015-10-03 23:20:55	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-10-03 23:21:41	ScruffyChat	There should just be a big banner at the top of the site saying "If you want to make a fanon game, click here," and in a page describe all the basics and templates
2015-10-03 23:21:48	@PikFan	oh, by the way, Espyo, how's the engine going?
2015-10-03 23:21:50	ScruffyChat	I mean, there is that already
2015-10-03 23:21:55	@PikFan	oh, good idea
2015-10-03 23:21:58	@Espyo	progress is so slow...
2015-10-03 23:22:04	@Espyo	but I did a bit of progress on bridges today
2015-10-03 23:22:05	@PikFan	:(
2015-10-03 23:22:06	@Espyo	so that's something
2015-10-03 23:22:09	@PikFan	oh, nice
2015-10-03 23:22:14	@Espyo	update should come shortly after that, really
2015-10-03 23:23:00	@PikFan	did you read what we were saying about {{enemy stats}}?

2015-10-03 23:26:05	@Espyo	no, actually
2015-10-03 23:26:16	@PikFan	:\
2015-10-03 23:26:27	@Espyo	yeah, there should be a "start here" page
2015-10-03 23:27:42	@PikFan	like how Pikipedia has the Quick Start guide
2015-10-03 23:30:57	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-03 23:47:29	@PikFan	Espyo, were you going to say what you thought of a fanon version of {{enemy stats}}
2015-10-03 23:47:30	Testyo	"enemy_stats" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:enemy_stats
2015-10-03 23:50:12	@Espyo	I like the idea
2015-10-03 23:51:00	@PikFan	I was wondering if, sometime, you could make one
2015-10-03 23:51:11	@PikFan	we'd just have to figure out how to write the game names
2015-10-03 23:51:37	@PikFan	maybe like g1=game name, g2=another game, ...
2015-10-03 23:51:41	@Espyo	it'd be VERY hard
2015-10-03 23:51:47	@Espyo	I'd recommend just making a manual table, really
2015-10-03 23:51:52	@Espyo	or
2015-10-03 23:51:57	@Espyo	like we have {{p2 enemy technical}}
2015-10-03 23:51:58	Testyo	"p2_enemy_technical" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:p2_enemy_technical
2015-10-03 23:52:00	@Espyo	and {{p2 enemy property}}
2015-10-03 23:52:01	Testyo	"p2_enemy_property" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:p2_enemy_property
2015-10-03 23:52:59	@PikFan	I don't understand
2015-10-03 23:53:27	@PikFan	...wait, oh
2015-10-03 23:53:33	@PikFan	I get it now
2015-10-03 23:53:41	@PikFan	I wasn't reading the documentation right
2015-10-03 23:54:25	@PikFan	yeah, manual table would probably be easier
2015-10-03 23:54:53	@PikFan	it'd also allow more customization, so you wouldn't have to go edit the template itself
2015-10-03 23:55:44	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I guess we could have a page that explains how tables work, and specifically how users can use this "template" table
2015-10-03 23:56:11	@PikFan	fanon doesn't even have a Help:Tables page
2015-10-03 23:56:23	@PikFan	I'm finding myself over at the Pikipedia version a lot
2015-10-03 23:56:25	@Espyo	no, the users wouldn't have to edit the stats template
2015-10-03 23:56:27	@Espyo	just its call
2015-10-03 23:56:37	@Espyo	the template just creates the headers
2015-10-03 23:56:43	@Espyo	"HP", "Regen", etc.
2015-10-03 23:56:48	@Espyo	another template creates one line on the table
2015-10-03 23:56:58	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-03 23:57:04	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-10-03 23:57:06	@Espyo	instead of users doing | 13 || 34 || {{tt|55|This means it's strong compared to bla bla}}

2015-10-03 23:57:54	@PikFan	so... several templates, each with their own parameters filled out, put inside the parameters of another, bigger template?
2015-10-03 23:58:25	@PikFan	and each individual template is its own line

2015-10-04 21:23:52	ScruffyChat	Haha
2015-10-04 21:24:03	ScruffyChat	Guess what it is, it's a real instrument
2015-10-04 21:24:16	@PikFan	no idea
2015-10-04 21:24:22	ScruffyChat	I had to sing that
2015-10-04 21:24:39	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-10-04 21:24:44	ScruffyChat	I sang it up really high, then transposed it way down with a normal formant
2015-10-04 21:24:55	@PikFan	mhm
2015-10-04 21:24:58	@PikFan	also
2015-10-04 21:25:14	@PikFan	last night I summed up most of my ideas on my game's talk page
2015-10-04 21:25:42	ScruffyChat	I saw
2015-10-04 21:25:48	ScruffyChat	You've got really good ideas
2015-10-04 21:26:59	@PikFan	thank you
2015-10-04 21:27:19	@PikFan	I put a giant red notice on the main game page, so hopefully more people are aware
2015-10-04 21:27:30	ScruffyChat	If you were to rename the game, what do you think you would call it?
2015-10-04 21:27:50	@PikFan	not sure
2015-10-04 21:28:09	@PikFan	I'll come up with something
2015-10-04 21:28:15	ScruffyChat	Well, I suppose you can't decide that until you know how the story's gonna go
2015-10-04 21:28:15	@PikFan	I always do
2015-10-04 21:28:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 21:29:37	ScruffyChat	I really liked what you said about balancing the over- and underworlds
2015-10-04 21:29:49	ScruffyChat	Pikmin 2 did spend a majority underground
2015-10-04 21:30:34	@PikFan	like I said, I loved Pikmin 2, but most of my memories of it are... dark
2015-10-04 21:31:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 21:31:32	ScruffyChat	Not even the collectibles were as enchanting
2015-10-04 21:31:50	@PikFan	sadly
2015-10-04 21:31:51	ScruffyChat	They were common objects, not colorful ship parts or fruit
2015-10-04 21:32:04	@PikFan	well
2015-10-04 21:32:09	ScruffyChat	But I think the game felt a lot more natural at times than P3, even with lesser graphics
2015-10-04 21:32:16	@PikFan	some of them were fruits
2015-10-04 21:32:20	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-04 21:32:27	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-04 21:32:54	@PikFan	there were more manmade formations in P3
2015-10-04 21:32:59	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-04 21:33:08	@PikFan	I'm looking at you, fragments
2015-10-04 21:33:14	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2015-10-04 21:34:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah, even if you compare the Glutton's Kitchen to, say... the Garden of Hope, the Garden of Hope is happier
2015-10-04 21:34:29	ScruffyChat	Either way, without a doubt, P2 is the weirdest of them for me
2015-10-04 21:34:33	@PikFan	Espyo: did you read what I said on [[f:Talk:Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds]]?

2015-10-04 21:34:54	@PikFan	so awkward
2015-10-04 21:35:20	ScruffyChat	Ain't no thang
2015-10-04 21:35:32	@PikFan	lol
2015-10-04 21:35:34	ScruffyChat	That reminds me though, I wanted to help you name that jungle area
2015-10-04 21:35:46	@PikFan	oh, ok
2015-10-04 21:35:53	ScruffyChat	And to do so I wanted to ask you what's in it, how do you want it to look?
2015-10-04 21:36:23	@PikFan	I'm thinking that it'll have pretty dense foilage
2015-10-04 21:36:35	@PikFan	it'll be hot and humid, I think
2015-10-04 21:36:52	@PikFan	there'll also be a swamp in the middle
2015-10-04 21:37:29	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-10-04 21:37:35	@PikFan	oh, also, I tried looking for synonyms for "jungle", but all I got were forest and woods
2015-10-04 21:37:57	@PikFan	then I remembered, I can just use "wilds"
2015-10-04 21:37:58	ScruffyChat	There's also boscage
2015-10-04 21:38:13	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-04 21:38:22	ScruffyChat	And if you want to focus on the swamp, there's plenty of choices
2015-10-04 21:38:22	@PikFan	what's boscage mean?
2015-10-04 21:38:31	ScruffyChat	Bog, mire, morass
2015-10-04 21:38:49	ScruffyChat	Boscage means massed trees and shrubs
2015-10-04 21:39:03	@PikFan	alright
2015-10-04 21:39:25	<--	UltraMario (UltraMario@d-75-69-344-16.hsd6.nj.comcast.net) has quit
2015-10-04 21:39:29	ScruffyChat	"Tangle" is also good, if you want to emphasize the density of the shrucs
2015-10-04 21:39:32	ScruffyChat	shrubs*
2015-10-04 21:39:42	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-04 21:40:22	@PikFan	to emphasize the climate, I was thinking about using "steamy" as an adjective
2015-10-04 21:40:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 21:40:41	@PikFan	so... Steamy Boscage
2015-10-04 21:40:42	ScruffyChat	You're getting pretty close to "Scalding Thicket" from PF
2015-10-04 21:40:59	ScruffyChat	Actually Steaming Boscage was my first name for that PF area
2015-10-04 21:41:07	@PikFan	oh wow
2015-10-04 21:41:32	ScruffyChat	But then I changed it because everyone I asked seemed to expect "Steaming" to lead to dump
2015-10-04 21:41:42	ScruffyChat	Immature, but duly noted
2015-10-04 21:41:59	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-04 21:42:20	ScruffyChat	Boscage can still work, but you need something else if you want to describe the humidity
2015-10-04 21:42:42	@PikFan	hm, alright
2015-10-04 21:42:47	ScruffyChat	I chose "Scalding" because there will be steam rising everywhere in the area
2015-10-04 21:42:55	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-04 21:43:00	ScruffyChat	But there's blistering, boiling
2015-10-04 21:43:05	ScruffyChat	Piping
2015-10-04 21:43:08	ScruffyChat	Sizzling
2015-10-04 21:43:19	@PikFan	well, Wilds is a nice, generic term
2015-10-04 21:43:20	ScruffyChat	Or balmy
2015-10-04 21:43:23	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 21:43:36	ScruffyChat	How about the sweltering wilds
2015-10-04 21:43:46	@PikFan	even though it was already used twice by the canon games
2015-10-04 21:43:51	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2015-10-04 21:44:01	@PikFan	let me look at your adjectives
2015-10-04 21:45:05	@PikFan	well, I like sweltering the best
2015-10-04 21:45:13	@PikFan	Sweltering Wilds it is
2015-10-04 21:45:20	ScruffyChat	Balmy, summery, scorching, sultry, humid, muggy, torrid, baking,
2015-10-04 21:45:27	ScruffyChat	Oh, okay
2015-10-04 21:45:39	@PikFan	wait, torrid
2015-10-04 21:45:49	@PikFan	define torrid?
2015-10-04 21:45:59	@Espyo	no, I didn't read it
2015-10-04 21:46:00	ScruffyChat	That especially means hot and dry
2015-10-04 21:46:05	@Espyo	remember I'm not much of a fanon guy
2015-10-04 21:46:12	ScruffyChat	Or full of difficulty and tribulation
2015-10-04 21:46:19	@PikFan	dry
2015-10-04 21:46:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the converse of humid
2015-10-04 21:47:05	@PikFan	well, if it denotes dryness, I can't use it
2015-10-04 21:47:35	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-10-04 21:47:47	@PikFan	Espyo: even so, you seem to have a good grasp of game design
2015-10-04 21:47:50	ScruffyChat	Well then sweltering is more generic, it's just uncomfortably hot
2015-10-04 21:48:09	@Espyo	hm, but I'm not following the fanon RC much anyway
2015-10-04 21:49:06	@PikFan	you don't have to, I put a link up top
2015-10-04 21:49:50	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: actually, I might use "torrid" for the Distant Desert
2015-10-04 21:49:57	@Espyo	it's a bit of a long read...
2015-10-04 21:50:38	@PikFan	no, just focus on the 2015 update
2015-10-04 21:51:18	@PikFan	...eh, never mind
2015-10-04 21:52:28	@PikFan	anyway, Scruffy, I'm torn between sultry and sweltering
2015-10-04 21:58:20	@PikFan	going to another tab; might disconnect
2015-10-04 21:59:45	ScruffyChat	Sultry especially suggests humid
2015-10-04 22:00:55	@PikFan	yay
2015-10-04 22:01:17	ScruffyChat	It's more specific than sweltering, apparently
2015-10-04 22:01:42	@PikFan	awesome
2015-10-04 22:01:44	ScruffyChat	Be warned, it can also mean sexy
2015-10-04 22:01:52	@PikFan	...oh
2015-10-04 22:01:53	ScruffyChat	But then again, so can most of the words for "hot"
2015-10-04 22:02:06	ScruffyChat	So I think you don't have to worry about that
2015-10-04 22:02:52	ScruffyChat	Well... actually, maybe sultry means it more so than other words
2015-10-04 22:03:22	@PikFan	gah
2015-10-04 22:03:42	ScruffyChat	Sorry!
2015-10-04 22:03:54	ScruffyChat	How come the Pikmin development team has such an easy time of ti
2015-10-04 22:04:49	@PikFan	probably because they base areas off the seasons
2015-10-04 22:05:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 22:06:13	@PikFan	bleh, I guess I'll use sweltering for now
2015-10-04 22:06:27	@PikFan	brb, gotta unload the dishwasher
2015-10-04 22:06:35	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-10-04 22:16:52	@PikFan	back
2015-10-04 22:18:19	ScruffyChat	Hey
2015-10-04 22:18:28	ScruffyChat	I was thinking, you mentioned the seasons
2015-10-04 22:18:36	@PikFan	mhm?
2015-10-04 22:18:52	ScruffyChat	And since you have 8 areas, and the game is about "Connection of the Worlds"
2015-10-04 22:19:08	ScruffyChat	The areas could somehow bring into reference the eight planets?

2015-10-04 22:19:29	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-04 22:20:11	@PikFan	though, I'm not sure how I'd incorporate that into my areas...
2015-10-04 22:20:20	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-04 22:21:25	@PikFan	hmmmm...
2015-10-04 22:21:44	@PikFan	well
2015-10-04 22:22:11	@PikFan	the Ancient Valley could represent Mars, because it's rocky
2015-10-04 22:22:34	@PikFan	Distant Desert, Venus, because it's hot

2015-10-04 22:23:13	@PikFan	Mars could be the Bitterfrost Woods, because they're both a bit cold
2015-10-04 22:23:21	@PikFan	hey En_Passant
2015-10-04 22:23:52	@PikFan	Jupiter could be the Whispering Grove, because huge
2015-10-04 22:24:25	@PikFan	Saturn, Cove of Tranquility, because pretty
2015-10-04 22:24:48	@PikFan	Uranus, Sweltering Wilds, because freakishness
2015-10-04 22:25:25	@PikFan	and Pluto, Rugged Tundra, because coldness
2015-10-04 22:25:36	@PikFan	wait, hmm
2015-10-04 22:26:02	@PikFan	actually Saturn might be the Melodic Meadow
2015-10-04 22:26:13	En_Passant	Uh
2015-10-04 22:26:24	@PikFan	and then Neptune could be the Cove, because water
2015-10-04 22:26:44	@PikFan	sorry, Scruffy suggested an idea to me
2015-10-04 22:26:50	En_Passant	I hope you're not trying to make your title make sense by converting your areas into planets
2015-10-04 22:27:06	@PikFan	14:24	ScruffyChat	And since you have 8 areas, and the game is about "Connection of the Worlds"
2015-10-04 22:27:32	@PikFan	14:24	ScruffyChat	The areas could somehow bring into reference the eight planets?
2015-10-04 22:27:48	En_Passant	So it's just symbolism?
2015-10-04 22:27:55	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-04 22:27:59	En_Passant	I see
2015-10-04 22:28:02	@PikFan	not conversion, lol
2015-10-04 22:28:19	En_Passant	Will the Roman deities the planets are named after have any involvement in it?
2015-10-04 22:28:39	@PikFan	...maybe
2015-10-04 22:28:49	@PikFan	that's a good point
2015-10-04 22:29:28	En_Passant	Yeah, there's not a lot to say about the planets themselves
2015-10-04 22:29:37	En_Passant	We don't really know how gas giants work
2015-10-04 22:29:45	ScruffyChat	Have to go, be back later

2015-10-04 22:31:32	@PikFan	En_Passant: though I can't see how the Ancient Valley would do with speed (Mercury), or how the Distant Desert would be pretty (Venus)
2015-10-04 22:31:57	En_Passant	*shrug* I joined when you said Mars
2015-10-04 22:32:11	@PikFan	oh, true, sorry
2015-10-04 22:32:17	En_Passant	You could swap them, though
2015-10-04 22:32:26	En_Passant	Ancient Valley would be quite marvelous
2015-10-04 22:32:26	@PikFan	maybe
2015-10-04 22:32:42	En_Passant	And Distant Desert -> oil -> commerce -> Mercury
2015-10-04 22:32:52	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-04 22:33:26	@PikFan	I took the physical characteristics of each planet and then tried translating them to my areas
2015-10-04 22:34:26	@PikFan	oh, I know how I could incorporate these into my areas
2015-10-04 22:34:34	En_Passant	I would swap Mars and Uranus as well
2015-10-04 22:35:02	En_Passant	Any planet far from its sun will be cold
2015-10-04 22:35:13	@PikFan	did I tell you how 8 new caves appear after the final boss is defeated?
2015-10-04 22:35:19	@PikFan	oh, true
2015-10-04 22:35:22	En_Passant	Yes
2015-10-04 22:35:44	En_Passant	You want to theme them to the planets/deities
2015-10-04 22:35:51	@PikFan	well, maybe at the end of each cave will be a stone that looks like a planet
2015-10-04 22:36:15	En_Passant	Or a model planet from a science project
2015-10-04 22:36:19	En_Passant	Make them a treasure set
2015-10-04 22:36:21	@PikFan	and all of these stones, together, unlock the true final area

2015-10-04 22:43:09	En_Passant	They're not painted
2015-10-04 22:43:25	@PikFan	right, but they still have a design
2015-10-04 22:43:25	En_Passant	They have something in the middle, and they look pretty
2015-10-04 22:44:16	En_Passant	The paint would likely be worn after such a long time as well

2015-10-04 22:52:36	En_Passant	Smuggling treasures from PNF-404 would already get him tons of cash
2015-10-04 22:52:44	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-04 22:52:57	@PikFan	Espyo: everything ok?
2015-10-04 22:53:12	En_Passant	And it already adds depth to the series by showing some real implications of Olimar's discovery
2015-10-04 22:53:53	@PikFan	what do you mean
2015-10-04 22:58:23	En_Passant	Well, Olimar discovered a whole planet full of treasure. It'd be weird if Hocotate Freight was the only one that actually tried to collect it
2015-10-04 22:59:20	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-10-04 22:59:26	@PikFan	makes sense
2015-10-04 22:59:42	En_Passant	In real life, most major discoveries/successes have both rivals and criminals trying to replicate it
2015-10-04 22:59:59	En_Passant	Nintendo doesn't usually cover that sort of thing, so including it would be spectacular imo
2015-10-04 23:00:04	@Espyo	yeah, internet was acting weird

2015-10-04 23:09:49	@PikFan	I'm keeping the revolring part, because it's important for the next game's plot
2015-10-04 23:09:58	@PikFan	*revolting
2015-10-04 23:10:19	@PikFan	but I can agree with removing the raiding
2015-10-04 23:10:58	En_Passant	There's a next game?
2015-10-04 23:11:06	En_Passant	I thought you cancelled that

2015-10-04 23:13:42	ScruffyChat	So the objective is apprehending Asfer. Can this be done in any area? Or is it a matter of progressing through areas until you get to where he is?

2015-10-04 23:16:32	@PikFan	I know that's unorthodox for Pikmin, but still...

2015-10-04 23:17:31	@PikFan	good point
2015-10-04 23:17:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah, kind of like how the Titan Dweevil worked
2015-10-04 23:18:03	@PikFan	that's the thing, I don't want it to be too similar
2015-10-04 23:18:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 23:18:38	ScruffyChat	Well what are we talking about with giant robot, is it humanoid? Or maybe built like an enemy on PNF-404?
2015-10-04 23:18:51	@PikFan	not sure yet
2015-10-04 23:19:22	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-10-04 23:19:59	@PikFan	I've been thinking about everything else
2015-10-04 23:23:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah, this seems like a big undertaking
2015-10-04 23:23:56	@PikFan	oh, it is
2015-10-04 23:24:02	ScruffyChat	But plot should come first, from story comes everything else
2015-10-04 23:24:29	ScruffyChat	I do like the idea of someone trying to get the upper hand on Hocotate
2015-10-04 23:25:18	En_Passant	I disagree with that. Story doesn't have to be the center of a story
2015-10-04 23:25:24	En_Passant	*of a game
2015-10-04 23:25:38	ScruffyChat	Well yes, story doesn't have to be the center
2015-10-04 23:27:29	ScruffyChat	No, you're right, I take it back
2015-10-04 23:27:42	ScruffyChat	Story doesn't have to be first
2015-10-04 23:29:36	ScruffyChat	that's film theory, not video games
2015-10-04 23:30:45	@PikFan	I want Nintendo to make more Pikmin movies ;_;
2015-10-04 23:31:14	ScruffyChat	Shigeru Miyamoto wanted a cartoon series
2015-10-04 23:31:57	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-04 23:32:10	@PikFan	he should do a Pikmin anime
2015-10-04 23:33:11	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah
2015-10-04 23:33:21	ScruffyChat	Emperor Bulblax would look amazing in that style
2015-10-04 23:34:40	@PikFan	somebody made an Attack on Titan knockoff based on Pikmin, if you know what Attack on Titan is
2015-10-04 23:35:25	@PikFan	it's... only a minute and a half long, but I thought it was cool
2015-10-04 23:36:31	ScruffyChat	hahaha
2015-10-04 23:36:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-04 23:36:39	ScruffyChat	Oh, I have to go again
2015-10-04 23:36:45	ScruffyChat	I might be on later, but I'm not sure
2015-10-04 23:37:03	@PikFan	everything ok?
2015-10-04 23:37:24	ScruffyChat	Yes, just have a meeting to attend

2015-10-05 02:19:35	ScruffyChat	Hi!
2015-10-05 02:20:04	@PikFan	how was your meeting
2015-10-05 02:20:20	ScruffyChat	Went very well
2015-10-05 02:20:40	ScruffyChat	I'm working on this composition project, and it's in its final adjustment stage
2015-10-05 02:20:40	@PikFan	that's good
2015-10-05 02:20:50	ScruffyChat	Pretty soon it'll be ready to print
2015-10-05 02:21:08	@PikFan	nice
2015-10-05 02:21:39	ScruffyChat	So how are things going, did anyone make conceptual progress on their games?
2015-10-05 02:22:24	@PikFan	just barely
2015-10-05 02:22:37	ScruffyChat	That's still something
2015-10-05 02:22:57	@PikFan	I decided to rename the Deception Plateau to the Baleful Isle
2015-10-05 02:23:07	ScruffyChat	ooh
2015-10-05 02:23:43	@PikFan	though En_Passant says I need a less obvious adjective
2015-10-05 02:24:05	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2015-10-05 02:24:34	@PikFan	considering that I didn't know what baleful was before searching for a similar word, I'd say it works
2015-10-05 02:24:42	ScruffyChat	Baleful specifically means menacing, or having a destructive effect
2015-10-05 02:25:23	@PikFan	right
2015-10-05 02:26:52	ScruffyChat	Perhaps the Bitter Isle?

2015-10-05 03:03:58	@PikFan	it'll probably release within the next 6 months
2015-10-05 03:04:46	GerardoRV	I mean the NX is coming out probably on late 2016 or early 2017 so it may be something like TLoZ Twilight princess, where it comes out in both
2015-10-05 03:04:48	@PikFan	anyway, I'm going to be back in about 30 minutes
2015-10-05 03:05:10	@PikFan	maybe
2015-10-05 03:05:17	GerardoRV	I doubt it will come out so early, They would´ve announced it at E3
2015-10-05 03:05:22	GerardoRV	Ok
2015-10-05 03:05:40	@PikFan	I'll be back soon

2015-10-05 03:50:38	@PikFan	January 2011
2015-10-05 03:50:45	@PikFan	long while ago
2015-10-05 03:53:31	GerardoRV	Wow! I cant believe Ive been a fan of the game for more than 10 years and never knew about this

2015-10-05 03:59:36	ScruffyChat	Sorry it took so long

2015-10-05 04:06:01	GerardoRV	Dont worry
2015-10-05 04:11:40	ScruffyChat	GerardoRV, which would you say is your favorite one in the series?
2015-10-05 04:11:47	ScruffyChat	I know it's a tough choice
2015-10-05 04:12:45	GerardoRV	I think Pikmin 3, Pikmin reminds me of anot so happy moment in my life while 3 does the opposite
2015-10-05 04:13:02	GerardoRV	And I didnt like the caverns in Pikmin 2
2015-10-05 04:13:59	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-05 04:14:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah I really enjoyed Pikmin 3
2015-10-05 04:14:12	ScruffyChat	Especially the Mission Mode
2015-10-05 04:14:16	ScruffyChat	I can't stop playing it

2015-10-05 04:26:15	En_Passant	I'm just not paying attention :P
2015-10-05 04:26:23	ScruffyChat	lol
2015-10-05 04:26:49	ScruffyChat	En_Passant, has PikFan told you about our mutual ideas for the Lunar Long Legs, Pikmin Forever's final boss?
2015-10-05 04:27:13	ScruffyChat	I was wondering what you would think of them, you have a keen eye for game design
2015-10-05 04:27:35	En_Passant	I'd like to hear them
2015-10-05 04:27:55	@PikFan	busy right now, sorry
2015-10-05 04:28:22	En_Passant	I'll tell you now that I have some strong opinions about the LLL
2015-10-05 04:28:34	ScruffyChat	You do?
2015-10-05 04:28:48	En_Passant	Yes
2015-10-05 04:29:07	ScruffyChat	Like what? I love input on it
2015-10-05 04:29:29	En_Passant	I'll put it bluntly: I hate literally everything regarding it.
2015-10-05 04:29:39	En_Passant	As a boss, it seems bland
2015-10-05 04:30:20	En_Passant	As an enemy, it doesn't make evolutionary sense
2015-10-05 04:30:29	En_Passant	And Onion moons defy science
2015-10-05 04:30:49	En_Passant	Would you like me to go into more detail?
2015-10-05 04:30:59	ScruffyChat	Yes, please. I can take it
2015-10-05 04:31:39	En_Passant	I'll start with Onion moons
2015-10-05 04:33:36	En_Passant	I don't know how large you plan on them being, but at any size remotely close to Earth, you run into huge problems
2015-10-05 04:34:11	En_Passant	For one, their gravity would start adversely affecting the planet
2015-10-05 04:35:13	En_Passant	It would shift the tides and skew the orbits of both the Earth and the Moon
2015-10-05 04:35:22	ScruffyChat	I agree
2015-10-05 04:35:28	En_Passant	Also, the resources required to make one would eat up ecosystems of energy
2015-10-05 04:35:28	ScruffyChat	I never knew how to get around that
2015-10-05 04:36:00	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-05 04:36:30	ScruffyChat	That's why I suggested that Onions form a network of roots that connect all plants and fungi on Earth
2015-10-05 04:36:56	ScruffyChat	All those organisms would be providing energy to grow the satellite
2015-10-05 04:37:20	ScruffyChat	But eventually, gravitational problems would outweigh energy problems
2015-10-05 04:37:28	ScruffyChat	And I don't know how to work around it
2015-10-05 04:37:28	En_Passant	And there are other problems
2015-10-05 04:38:36	En_Passant	Like, why would the planet be set up so that its reproduction relies on a species that every creature and their mother predates on
2015-10-05 04:39:08	En_Passant	Also, the Earth is mostly rock; Pikmin have little rock in them
2015-10-05 04:39:37	En_Passant	Rock Pikmin are more plausibly just a hard exterior like a shell than actually having rock skin
2015-10-05 04:39:45	ScruffyChat	Agreed
2015-10-05 04:40:28	ScruffyChat	As far as Pikmin being a species at the bottom of the food chain, I always figured that Pikmin needed a leader
2015-10-05 04:41:09	ScruffyChat	And this system would be going on to say the planet needs a leader in order to reproduce, just as Pikmin do
2015-10-05 04:41:32	En_Passant	Which is counter to all evolutionary sense
2015-10-05 04:42:29	En_Passant	I mean, I guess so are other things like that one flower species that coevolved to be reliant on a single species of bee
2015-10-05 04:43:16	En_Passant	But natural selection will kill those out. The planet's just failing if that happens because it doesn't have competition
2015-10-05 04:43:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-05 04:45:18	ScruffyChat	I guess, this started by trying to understand what Onions are, what their purpose is
2015-10-05 04:45:28	ScruffyChat	Outside of just Pikmin
2015-10-05 04:45:43	En_Passant	What's the purpose of any life form?
2015-10-05 04:45:59	ScruffyChat	It's a difficult question
2015-10-05 04:46:14	En_Passant	I was trying to think of a good way to say it, and you saying that allowed me to put it together
2015-10-05 04:47:28	En_Passant	Well, hm. Maybe not.
2015-10-05 04:47:42	En_Passant	I'll ask you this: Why make the planet sentient?
2015-10-05 04:47:57	En_Passant	Of all of the purposes that could exist, why this one?
2015-10-05 04:47:58	ScruffyChat	Not sentient, just alive
2015-10-05 04:48:29	ScruffyChat	It tries to maintain homeostasis, but is not aware that it does this
2015-10-05 04:48:48	En_Passant	Okay, that's true, but it doesn't answer the question
2015-10-05 04:49:07	ScruffyChat	Right, the question is why
2015-10-05 04:49:09	En_Passant	What's wrong with the idea that Pikmin and Onions are just another life form that's evolved after 10 million years?
2015-10-05 04:49:52	ScruffyChat	Nothing's wrong with it, but I was always interested in the idea that they are composite life-forms, plant and animal
2015-10-05 04:50:25	ScruffyChat	So I felt they were meant to do something more than just evolve like other species, they were some sort of bridge species
2015-10-05 04:51:55	En_Passant	Well, even then, it would still be more plausible to say that Olimar's initial observation was wrong and they're just plants that have evolved animal-like traits
2015-10-05 04:52:10	En_Passant	The Creeping Chrysanthemum is also such a hybrid, you know
2015-10-05 04:52:47	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-05 04:53:47	En_Passant	That's all I have to say on that topic
2015-10-05 04:54:01	ScruffyChat	Well I will definitely have to think about that
2015-10-05 04:54:16	ScruffyChat	It's an important question, why make the world alive and dependent on Pikmin
2015-10-05 04:54:34	ScruffyChat	I'd like to say I have a reason, but I don't for the question of why.
2015-10-05 04:55:04	ScruffyChat	It was just the impetus for my story
2015-10-05 04:57:37	En_Passant	Okay, on to the LLL itself
2015-10-05 04:57:45	Pidgeotto	LLL?
2015-10-05 04:57:49	En_Passant	Lunar Long Legs
2015-10-05 04:57:53	Pidgeotto	o
2015-10-05 04:58:18	En_Passant	So, the Onions moons are supposed to be hidden so they're not disturbed, right?
2015-10-05 04:59:30	En_Passant	How and why would a species evolve to mimic something like that, especially since the other Long Legs already lack natural predators?
2015-10-05 05:00:16	ScruffyChat	I was thinking the LLL is a predator of other Long Legs
2015-10-05 05:00:28	ScruffyChat	But it is unlikely others would frequent that environment
2015-10-05 05:00:41	En_Passant	And even more unlikely that it would leave
2015-10-05 05:00:57	En_Passant	Its camouflage is only effective where there are Onion moons
2015-10-05 05:01:28	En_Passant	Even so, there's no advantage to it
2015-10-05 05:01:42	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-05 05:02:28	ScruffyChat	You're so right, I haven't thought this through enough
2015-10-05 05:03:38	En_Passant	Do you still want me to cover the last part, then?
2015-10-05 05:03:55	ScruffyChat	Yes, this needs an overhaul
2015-10-05 05:04:03	En_Passant	Okay
2015-10-05 05:04:33	En_Passant	So, for a climactic final boss, it's both simple and unoriginal
2015-10-05 05:04:44	En_Passant	It's basically a Raging Long Legs on steroids and nothing more
2015-10-05 05:05:07	En_Passant	Those things can already kill most of your army if you don't pay attention
2015-10-05 05:05:12	En_Passant	*in one stomp
2015-10-05 05:05:20	@PikFan	that's where our ideas come in
2015-10-05 05:05:36	ScruffyChat	That's where Pikfan and I had thought of new ideas
2015-10-05 05:06:22	@PikFan	we had the idea of going INSIDE the LLL, strange it may be
2015-10-05 05:06:48	ScruffyChat	It would be the final cave in the game, since the LLL is sort of a planet of its own
2015-10-05 05:07:05	@PikFan	and fight a giant Arachorb
2015-10-05 05:07:11	ScruffyChat	Arachnode*
2015-10-05 05:07:19	@PikFan	er, right
2015-10-05 05:07:20	ScruffyChat	that holds Edward in its web
2015-10-05 05:07:52	@PikFan	complete with elemental attacks and such
2015-10-05 05:09:08	En_Passant	Intriguing.
2015-10-05 05:09:26	En_Passant	I'm looking for the size comparison of the LLL
2015-10-05 05:09:38	ScruffyChat	It should be on the LLL page
2015-10-05 05:09:41	En_Passant	I can't imagine this cave being very big
2015-10-05 05:10:14	ScruffyChat	Not really, just big enough for the battle
2015-10-05 05:10:15	En_Passant	Oh, there it is
2015-10-05 05:10:16	En_Passant	lol
2015-10-05 05:10:43	En_Passant	Well, then it's not really the "final cave" if there's no exploring in it
2015-10-05 05:10:52	ScruffyChat	No, not really
2015-10-05 05:10:58	ScruffyChat	And it doesn't necessarily return
2015-10-05 05:11:18	ScruffyChat	After you finish it
2015-10-05 05:11:36	ScruffyChat	But you'd enter through a hole and escape through a geyser, from what I imagine
2015-10-05 05:12:15	En_Passant	It could return, just don't have the head explode
2015-10-05 05:12:20	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-05 05:12:30	En_Passant	The Arachnode could hold the shovel, or it could be somewhere in the cave
2015-10-05 05:12:34	ScruffyChat	Just have the head fall to the ground and become inactive
2015-10-05 05:12:38	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-05 05:12:54	@PikFan	like the Quaggled Mireclops
2015-10-05 05:13:02	En_Passant	Exactly
2015-10-05 05:13:41	En_Passant	I have a question to the interior boss itself: Is there a purpose to its elemental attacks?
2015-10-05 05:13:56	ScruffyChat	We haven't discussed its attacks yet
2015-10-05 05:14:02	En_Passant	Oh, okay
2015-10-05 05:16:23	ScruffyChat	I agree though that the LLL itself needs work
2015-10-05 05:16:39	ScruffyChat	I thought of it by combining gameplay elements
2015-10-05 05:17:00	ScruffyChat	Just as the Titan Dweevil combined treasures and enemies
2015-10-05 05:17:12	ScruffyChat	This boss combines terrain and enemies
2015-10-05 05:17:22	ScruffyChat	And as of now caves and enemies as well
2015-10-05 05:17:41	En_Passant	Reminds me of the Master Fortress from Smash 4
2015-10-05 05:17:53	ScruffyChat	Haha  yeah
2015-10-05 05:18:55	En_Passant	I need to go shower

2015-10-05 05:20:28	En_Passant	Yeah, me too
2015-10-05 05:21:34	En_Passant	One last thing, for the both of you, and completely irrelevant to this topic: Recolors/variants are good only in moderation. I hope you will try to make some original enemy concepts
2015-10-05 05:21:52	ScruffyChat	Yes, absolutely
2015-10-05 05:22:15	@PikFan	I know Scruffy will
2015-10-05 05:22:30	ScruffyChat	My only problem with making new enemies was that I often realized the trait that defined a new enemy could just be given to an older enemy
2015-10-05 05:22:31	@PikFan	as for me... not so much, unfortunately
2015-10-05 05:23:07	@PikFan	I just don't have that kind of creativity :/
2015-10-05 05:24:02	En_Passant	That's not necessarily bad, Scruffy. At least in my opinion, recycling old enemies into something new is good. I don't see a lot of developers doing that, though, so take it with a grain of salt.
2015-10-05 05:24:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-05 05:25:05	ScruffyChat	It's probably the notion of developers that players who see a familiar enemy in a new game will expect it to act familiarly

2015-10-05 05:55:34	En_Passant	I mean, the Hairy Bulborb was a bit of a joke in P2, so in Pikmin V I made it fill the role the Whiptongue had in 3. That's okay, right?

2015-10-05 05:59:43	@PikFan	yeah, design
2015-10-05 06:02:52	En_Passant	Um, well
2015-10-05 06:02:59	En_Passant	All of its attacks are fire-based
2015-10-05 06:03:15	@PikFan	no, not all
2015-10-05 06:03:26	@PikFan	there's an acid attack
2015-10-05 06:05:18	En_Passant	Right. Sorry.
2015-10-05 06:05:28	En_Passant	The first half of the fight is all fire, though
2015-10-05 06:05:28	@PikFan	it's fine
2015-10-05 06:05:35	@PikFan	true
2015-10-05 06:05:51	@PikFan	besides its stomping, yeah
2015-10-05 06:06:41	@PikFan	hm, maybe I should let it drop bomb rocks anytime
2015-10-05 06:06:54	En_Passant	I dunno. It all seems like overkill.
2015-10-05 06:07:03	En_Passant	Just tons of hitboxes to avoid
2015-10-05 06:07:58	@PikFan	it's meant to be difficult
2015-10-05 06:08:44	@PikFan	I made it have a lot of attacks so it wouldn't be boring, and also keep players on their toes
2015-10-05 06:09:16	En_Passant	You can do that without giving it 10 attacks to spam all the time, though
2015-10-05 06:09:52	@PikFan	so which attacks should I remove?
2015-10-05 06:12:20	@PikFan	hm, actually, I might get rid of the fire tornado attack
2015-10-05 06:12:42	@PikFan	I don't know how it could make a fire tornado
2015-10-05 06:12:48	@PikFan	and brb
2015-10-05 06:12:53	En_Passant	I was about to say the same thing
2015-10-05 06:14:13	En_Passant	Well, the thing is, the boss should have some strategy to it. That's what Pikmin 3's bosses were like, anyway
2015-10-05 06:14:58	En_Passant	The IEB is basically run around, hope you don't get destroyed, and throw Pikmin at its face whenever you can
2015-10-05 06:15:57	En_Passant	For an action game, that might be good. Pikmin's not one of those, though.
2015-10-05 06:15:58	@PikFan	back
2015-10-05 06:16:08	@PikFan	and I disagree
2015-10-05 06:16:23	@PikFan	Pikmin 3's bosses were like that
2015-10-05 06:16:31	@PikFan	just more flashy
2015-10-05 06:16:57	@PikFan	the only boss that has a strategy is the Vehemoth Phosbat
2015-10-05 06:20:19	En_Passant	You're the one that has played the game, so I guess I have to take your word
2015-10-05 06:21:12	En_Passant	Bosses throughout the series have been rather modest, though
2015-10-05 06:22:04	En_Passant	There's no need to have a lot of attacks when a Pikmin dies to anything it's not specially immune to
2015-10-05 06:24:43	@PikFan	yeah, you have to attack them whenever you can, like you said
2015-10-05 06:24:53	@PikFan	you just get fewer chances
2015-10-05 06:25:07	@PikFan	and I agree, they have been modest
2015-10-05 06:25:29	En_Passant	You could probably have the tongue as a basic attack, spewing lava for area denial, spitting lava globs/fireballs for range, and the power stomp as a non-fire desperation attack, and be good.
2015-10-05 06:25:45	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-05 06:26:03	En_Passant	Requires you to be careful, but without going Touhou
2015-10-05 06:26:15	@PikFan	I still want to keep the part where it gets stuck
2015-10-05 06:26:36	@PikFan	I think that's a good mechanic
2015-10-05 06:27:02	@PikFan	...then again, I was the one who made it, so there's that bias :P
2015-10-05 06:33:44	En_Passant	Personally, I think there should be more strategy involved in fighting enemies as whole
2015-10-05 06:33:57	En_Passant	There will definitely be that in Pikmin V
2015-10-05 06:35:40	ScruffyChat	I need to rethink my final boss definitely, to involve more of a strategy
2015-10-05 06:35:57	ScruffyChat	I like there being a first phase that becomes a cave
2015-10-05 06:36:18	ScruffyChat	But the first phase needs fleshing out; I feel like there isn't much of a strategy to it
2015-10-05 06:36:39	@PikFan	I agree
2015-10-05 06:37:28	@PikFan	now that I think on it, it doesn't feel epic when you're digging up weak spots while avoiding hazards
2015-10-05 06:37:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-05 06:37:42	@PikFan	if anything, it's basically a nuisance
2015-10-05 06:37:52	ScruffyChat	Maybe the LLL won't be the final boss
2015-10-05 06:38:17	@PikFan	especially for me, since I always do zero death runs
2015-10-05 06:38:28	ScruffyChat	Because I certainly need to rethink satellites with their own gravity on one planet
2015-10-05 06:38:35	@PikFan	now that is a revolutionary idea
2015-10-05 06:38:35	ScruffyChat	That can't happen
2015-10-05 06:39:42	ScruffyChat	Anyway, I'll think about it some more tomorrow
2015-10-05 06:39:47	ScruffyChat	But right now it is tomorrow for me
2015-10-05 06:39:52	ScruffyChat	I need to head to bed
2015-10-05 06:39:52	En_Passant	lol
2015-10-05 06:39:54	@PikFan	okay, isn't a strategy basically a way of doing something?
2015-10-05 06:40:19	@PikFan	like, the method
2015-10-05 06:40:26	En_Passant	It's a thought out way of doing something
2015-10-05 06:40:37	@PikFan	okay
2015-10-05 06:40:47	ScruffyChat	It involves planning how you're about to handle a task
2015-10-05 06:40:56	@PikFan	right
2015-10-05 06:41:13	@PikFan	most enemies just have one strategy, then
2015-10-05 06:41:23	@PikFan	and that's not good
2015-10-05 06:41:44	@PikFan	brb, again
2015-10-05 06:41:52	@PikFan	also night Scruffy
2015-10-05 06:41:57	En_Passant	Not necessarily just one, but one that's just more effective than the rest: Swarming
2015-10-05 06:42:07	En_Passant	night Scruffy
2015-10-05 06:42:44	ScruffyChat	Night, and thanks for all the input. Pikmin Forever is probably going to change a lot pretty soon.
2015-10-05 06:42:55	En_Passant	It will be changed... forever!
2015-10-05 06:44:20	ScruffyChat	Haha yep :)

2015-10-05 21:17:08	ScruffyChat	And really nice counterpoint
2015-10-05 21:18:34	En_Passant	What's that?

2015-10-05 21:26:52	En_Passant	I see
2015-10-05 21:26:59	En_Passant	I have a lot to learn about music
2015-10-05 21:27:09	ScruffyChat	no trouble
2015-10-05 21:27:26	ScruffyChat	I've recently been tutoring music theory at my college, and I'm getting the hang of teaching it
2015-10-05 21:28:10	@Espyo	I'd love to learn too
2015-10-05 21:28:16	@Espyo	there are just so many concepts...
2015-10-05 21:28:18	ScruffyChat	So if you have any questions about it, I'd love to answer them
2015-10-05 21:28:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it's a really interesting field
2015-10-05 21:28:42	@Espyo	http://www.daveconservatoire.org people really like this website, and the videos I saw months ago were pretty decent
2015-10-05 21:28:45	@Espyo	but it's still so much...
2015-10-05 21:29:07	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-10-05 21:29:30	ScruffyChat	I'd say the first thing to do with learning music is familiarizing oneself with a keyboard
2015-10-05 21:29:33	ScruffyChat	A piano keyboard
2015-10-05 21:29:47	ScruffyChat	As in what different notes sound like, what the different notes look like
2015-10-05 21:29:50	En_Passant	Oh, I decided to use Fruit Loops for music
2015-10-05 21:29:53	ScruffyChat	It really helps with visualization
2015-10-05 21:29:59	ScruffyChat	Oh cool!
2015-10-05 21:30:39	ScruffyChat	I'll admit I haven't used it all that often, but I'll get started really soon
2015-10-05 21:30:54	ScruffyChat	As soon as this week is finally over
2015-10-05 21:31:05	ScruffyChat	Floods, a composition project due, two tests
2015-10-05 21:31:51	En_Passant	Yeah, floods
2015-10-05 21:32:27	En_Passant	Good thing about living in near the mountains is no natural disasters
2015-10-05 21:32:49	En_Passant	Tornadoes rarely happen and blizzards show up once in a blue moon, and that's it
2015-10-05 21:33:27	ScruffyChat	Speaking loosely of mountains
2015-10-05 21:33:38	ScruffyChat	I thought a lot about your comments last night
2015-10-05 21:34:02	ScruffyChat	And I've completely redesigned how the final area of Pikmin Forever will work
2015-10-05 21:34:11	ScruffyChat	Along with big changes to the ending of the plot
2015-10-05 21:34:26	ScruffyChat	The whole thing still works without moons or the LLL
2015-10-05 21:34:35	ScruffyChat	I think
2015-10-05 21:35:54	En_Passant	Oh, really?
2015-10-05 21:36:13	ScruffyChat	Hopefully
2015-10-05 21:36:17	En_Passant	Can we get a sneak preview?
2015-10-05 21:36:33	ScruffyChat	Sure, in fact, I'd like your input before I go and change everything
2015-10-05 21:36:47	ScruffyChat	Because your ideas are really, really good

2015-10-05 21:37:17	En_Passant	You flatter me. I'm not that good
2015-10-05 21:37:40	ScruffyChat	Well, it was a good idea to keep things at least plausible scientifically
2015-10-05 21:37:47	ScruffyChat	So first I said Onion moons have to go
2015-10-05 21:37:55	ScruffyChat	There's no way to explain them completely
2015-10-05 21:38:10	ScruffyChat	So no more Onion moons, no more LLL
2015-10-05 21:38:28	ScruffyChat	But there still has to be something special connected to Pikmin on Canyon of Moonlight
2015-10-05 21:38:37	En_Passant	Of course
2015-10-05 21:38:47	ScruffyChat	Because there's a huge cluster of onions guarding it 
2015-10-05 21:38:57	ScruffyChat	And that's what both ships crash into
2015-10-05 21:39:06	ScruffyChat	So I needed to preserve that somehow
2015-10-05 21:39:18	ScruffyChat	So I thought what else would Onions try to protect

2015-10-05 21:40:04	En_Passant	My guess is some main Pikmin colony. They are probably vital to the ecosystem given their location in the food chain, plus they appear all over the globe
2015-10-05 21:40:14	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-05 21:40:32	ScruffyChat	So I imagined, what would this "Pikmin colony" look like
2015-10-05 21:40:51	ScruffyChat	And then I realized what Alph had realized at the beginning of P3
2015-10-05 21:40:58	ScruffyChat	that Onions resemble fruit
