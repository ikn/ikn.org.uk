2016-04-15 00:25:11	ScruffyChat	I've only taken Calc 1
2016-04-15 00:25:16	En_Passant	That's my opinion, at least
2016-04-15 00:25:27	@PikFan	hm
2016-04-15 00:26:26	En_Passant	I agree that knowing Pre-Calc well will help you a lot in real Calculus
2016-04-15 00:26:32	ScruffyChat	But differential equations, or derivatives, are really the heart of calculus
2016-04-15 00:26:48	ScruffyChat	And they're where the real-world usefulness of calculus kind of ends
2016-04-15 00:27:30	ScruffyChat	Unless you're job or role is specialized that way
2016-04-15 00:27:35	ScruffyChat	your*
2016-04-15 00:28:38	ScruffyChat	But I actually took Calc 1 last semester, after pre-cal was 3 years ago, and I still got the hang of it more than high school colleagues of mine who took it their senior year
2016-04-15 00:29:12	ScruffyChat	That's probably just our teachers though
2016-04-15 00:29:29	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-04-15 00:29:32	ScruffyChat	Calculus is a hard subject to teach in high school
2016-04-15 00:29:50	@PikFan	if only I had money, then I could get a tutor
2016-04-15 00:29:56	@PikFan	then I could learn as fast as I want
2016-04-15 00:30:59	En_Passant	I'm pretty sure there's another way
2016-04-15 00:31:11	En_Passant	I believe it's possible to test out of a class?
2016-04-15 00:31:42	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2016-04-15 00:31:59	@PikFan	though, I've heard about a math program at my city's university, which I should look into sometime
2016-04-15 00:41:27	ScruffyChat	Guys, I need some help with Chapter 2 of Louie
2016-04-15 00:41:55	@PikFan	huh, what's wrong?
2016-04-15 00:43:30	ScruffyChat	The chapter so far has set up how his dad met the woman he would marry
2016-04-15 00:45:14	@PikFan	mhm...?
2016-04-15 00:45:16	ScruffyChat	But Louie hasn't called her anything yet, mainly since his mom isn't referenced anywhere in the games
2016-04-15 00:45:38	@PikFan	oh, you need help coming up with a name
2016-04-15 00:45:51	ScruffyChat	Well yes, but
2016-04-15 00:46:02	ScruffyChat	I need help coming up with why she's never brought up
2016-04-15 00:46:41	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-04-15 00:46:53	@PikFan	didn't we have a conversation about this before?
2016-04-15 00:47:22	ScruffyChat	Yes but I didn't write it down :s
2016-04-15 00:47:28	En_Passant	gj
2016-04-15 00:47:38	@PikFan	lol
2016-04-15 00:47:38	En_Passant	She's probably dead
2016-04-15 00:47:46	UltraMario	rip
2016-04-15 00:47:53	@PikFan	so morbid En_Passant
2016-04-15 00:47:55	@PikFan	so morbid
2016-04-15 00:48:14	ScruffyChat	I was considering that, but that is a touch dark for Louie
2016-04-15 00:48:17	ScruffyChat	Although...
2016-04-15 00:48:28	ScruffyChat	Well, it's not impossible
2016-04-15 00:49:05	ScruffyChat	I was also considering that his dad really wanted a son but his wife did not, so they split and his dad adopted Louie feeling mainly spiteful
2016-04-15 00:49:55	@PikFan	or, you could say she decided to roam the galaxy in search of enlightenment
2016-04-15 00:50:16	@PikFan	what are her interests, again? I forgot
2016-04-15 00:50:32	ScruffyChat	Her major at the academy is space commerce
2016-04-15 00:50:44	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-04-15 00:50:58	ScruffyChat	I've already had the President go on a soul-searching journey
2016-04-15 00:51:04	@PikFan	oh...
2016-04-15 00:51:06	@PikFan	drat
2016-04-15 00:51:08	ScruffyChat	(one that Louie doesn't buy for a second)
2016-04-15 00:52:10	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-04-15 00:52:26	ScruffyChat	And besides, whether or not she wanted a child, she wouldn't leave on a soul-searching journey during that moemtn
2016-04-15 00:54:01	@PikFan	no, I implied that it happened after Louie became an adult
2016-04-15 00:54:07	@PikFan	...well, I guess I didn't imply it
2016-04-15 00:54:14	@PikFan	but now you know
2016-04-15 00:54:56	ScruffyChat	Right, but in the games it's his grandmother that feeds him bugs, has him play outside, and generally seems to care for him
2016-04-15 00:55:15	ScruffyChat	Either his mother is gone or... gone
2016-04-15 00:55:40	@PikFan	oh yeah

2016-04-15 01:00:10	@PikFan	I didn't get your response
2016-04-15 01:00:38	ScruffyChat	It would give Louie a detachment feeling

2016-04-15 23:40:32	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yes, but unused entities like Crystal_Maro_Frog came in useful, Testyo.

2016-04-16 00:17:00	@Espyo	well, if you can gather some more info
2016-04-16 00:17:03	@Espyo	add them on trivia, I guess
2016-04-16 00:17:24	Nvortex	yes
2016-04-16 00:17:30	Nvortex	those weird whistles and bells
2016-04-16 00:17:42	Nvortex	i don't know if it comes from the wraith or if it's an alternate versin
2016-04-16 00:17:55	@PikFan	it comes from the Wraith while it's reviving
2016-04-16 00:18:05	Nvortex	that's the problem
2016-04-16 00:18:26	Nvortex	it could be a different version of the oak that only plays when it's reviving
2016-04-16 00:18:37	Nvortex	or it could be coming DIRECTLY from the wraith
2016-04-16 00:18:48	Nvortex	but even if you are away from it you hear it so...
2016-04-16 00:19:09	Nvortex	formidable oak "wraith reviving"?
2016-04-16 00:19:33	@PikFan	but when you're away from it you hear it get quieter
2016-04-16 00:20:03	Nvortex	ok then i wil write it's from the wraith
2016-04-16 00:20:52	@PikFan	and plus you hear this theme whenever the Wraith's close to Olimar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P32y_jcfM4
2016-04-16 00:20:59	@PikFan	even if you're in a different part of the Oak
2016-04-16 00:21:13	@PikFan	so I don't think the bells and whistles are a variation of the music
2016-04-16 00:21:14	Nvortex	yeah but that's impossible to miss

2016-04-16 17:39:01	@Espyo	ok
2016-04-16 17:39:01	@Espyo	so
2016-04-16 17:39:10	@Espyo	I think the simplest way would be to split the main page in a table
2016-04-16 17:39:19	@Espyo	tables don't need to have their borders visible
2016-04-16 17:39:23	@Espyo	they can just serve to align content
2016-04-16 17:39:29	@Espyo	Pikipedia's front page is organized inside a two-column table
2016-04-16 17:39:39	@Espyo	you know how to make a table under MediaWiki?
2016-04-16 17:40:02	En_Passant	Under MediaWiki?
2016-04-16 17:40:21	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-16 17:40:21	@Espyo	you know
2016-04-16 17:40:25	@Espyo	{|
2016-04-16 17:40:30	En_Passant	Oh
2016-04-16 17:40:30	@Espyo	! header one
2016-04-16 17:40:31	En_Passant	Yeah

2016-04-16 17:40:40	@Espyo	right, start with that
2016-04-16 17:40:49	@Espyo	so, I guess you'd put the title and mission on one cell
2016-04-16 17:40:53	En_Passant	I don't know the fancy stuff
2016-04-16 17:41:02	@Espyo	the logo on the same row, second cell
2016-04-16 17:41:11	@Espyo	fancy stuff comes later

2016-04-16 17:50:57	@Espyo	it probably does
2016-04-16 17:51:01	@Espyo	thing is, it shouldn't let me COMPILE
2016-04-16 17:51:14	@Espyo	if at least one path returns something, then it does let you compile
2016-04-16 17:51:19	@Espyo	but if no paths do, it should give a compilation error
2016-04-16 17:51:23	@Espyo	which was my case, and it didn't
2016-04-16 17:52:03	@Espyo	meanwhile I'm installing visual studio on a virtual machine
2016-04-16 17:52:11	@Espyo	...I can't tell if this was a grave mistake
2016-04-16 17:52:28	@J	ouch
2016-04-16 17:52:58	@Espyo	but it has to beat booting up my old laptop just to compile the engine under windows, right?
2016-04-16 17:53:22	Yoshi2	maaaybe
2016-04-16 17:54:04	@Espyo	well, it's only using 50% of my RAM and 10% of my CPU
2016-04-16 17:54:06	@Espyo	so *shrug*
2016-04-16 17:56:17	@Espyo	J: crazy thing, but
2016-04-16 17:56:25	@Espyo	I check my youtube subscriptions daily
2016-04-16 17:56:30	@Espyo	and play videos under VLC
2016-04-16 17:56:41	@Espyo	because I can set my own playback speed, no ads, etc.
2016-04-16 17:57:15	@Espyo	the way I do this is to right-click the video's thumb, copy URL, and then Ctrl+V on VLC (Ctrl+V makes a dialog pop up to open a file or stream and automatically fills it with the clipboard)
2016-04-16 17:57:18	@Espyo	what I'm thinking is
2016-04-16 17:57:25	@Espyo	is there any way I can make even more shortcuts?
2016-04-16 17:57:29	@Espyo	using some crazy Linux wizardry?

2016-04-16 18:14:40	En_Passant	I have to start over because it failed to load the Source Editor the fifth time I opened it
2016-04-16 18:15:55	@Espyo	...
2016-04-16 18:16:06	@J	you mean videos embedded on another website
2016-04-16 18:16:08	@J	?
2016-04-16 18:17:38	@Espyo	not really
2016-04-16 18:17:53	@Espyo	I just meant ways to skip the whole "get the video's URL, play it on VLC" part
2016-04-16 18:17:56	@J	well, first thing is you can just copy the browser's current URL instead
2016-04-16 18:18:05	@J	so ctrl+l, ctrl+c in most browsers
2016-04-16 18:18:13	@Espyo	oh, I copy the video's URL before even entering the video's page
2016-04-16 18:18:14	@J	in the browser I use, I have it set to just 'y'
2016-04-16 18:18:26	@Espyo	so, I just get the video URL from the subscription's page
2016-04-16 18:18:27	@J	oh, from the subscriptions list?
2016-04-16 18:18:29	@J	okay
2016-04-16 18:18:30	@Espyo	mhm
2016-04-16 18:18:38	@Espyo	F6 also works in most browsers
2016-04-16 18:18:42	@J	similar thing, in my browser setup, that's Y while hovering over the link
2016-04-16 18:19:06	@J	but yeah, it should be easy to open vlc using the url in the clipboard
2016-04-16 18:19:54	@J	try vlc "$(xclip -selection clipboard -o)"
2016-04-16 18:20:05	@J	then assign that to a shortcut
2016-04-16 18:20:25	@J	probably there's some GUI to do that where you can add a command
2016-04-16 18:20:41	@J	I remember there being one in Ubuntu 8.04 or so when I used it
2016-04-16 18:21:02	@J	might need to install xclip if you don't have it already
2016-04-16 18:21:34	@J	I guess you could even write a browser addon to add an 'open in vlc' right-click menu shortcut, no idea how to do that though
2016-04-16 18:22:51	@J	you could also use my ytsubs script to get YT subscriptions as an RSS feed, then get a scriptable feed reader
2016-04-16 18:23:02	@Espyo	that would probably make me open VLC for every single video, though
2016-04-16 18:23:06	@Espyo	but a global shortcut sounds like a neat idea
2016-04-16 18:23:30	@J	for example, I use newsbeuter, which I could add a command like ',v' to to open an item's URL in VLC
2016-04-16 18:23:45	@Espyo	hm, that's actually a really nice idea
2016-04-16 18:24:59	@J	being a programmer / having a programmer's mindset should make it really easy for you to start fitting things like this together once you get an idea of how stuff works in general
2016-04-16 18:25:12	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-16 18:25:23	Nvortex	espyo, are flower pikmin the only ones capable of leaving "seeds" behind when killed?
2016-04-16 18:25:29	@Espyo	in P1? I think so

2016-04-16 18:27:50	@J	oh, one more thing: if you want to choose which quality VLC uses, you can use 'youtube-dl -g' to generate a URL for it
2016-04-16 18:28:14	@J	plus I use '--meta-title="$(youtube-dl -e "$1")"' to give VLC the video's title
2016-04-16 18:28:47	@Espyo	I think there are some settings on VLC itself to already choose a stream's quality
2016-04-16 18:28:57	@Espyo	and the window title already does get the video's title for me
2016-04-16 18:29:00	@Espyo	but thanks

2016-04-16 18:29:35	@Espyo	yeah, I think yt support has been improved over the past few versions
2016-04-16 18:29:45	@Espyo	ok, maybe not "few"
2016-04-16 18:30:17	@J	there's also the fact that youtube-dl gets fixes for changes to the YT website faster, not that it breaks very often
2016-04-16 18:30:35	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-04-16 18:30:54	@J	and it probably supports more video sites, though I only really use YT too

2016-04-16 18:35:26	En_Passant	What's the difference between style and span style?

2016-04-16 18:35:53	@Espyo	or if it does, it's only to be backwards compatible with REALLY old versions of HTML
2016-04-16 18:36:19	En_Passant	Oh, I see
2016-04-16 18:36:27	En_Passant	Is there any way to put it here:

2016-04-16 18:37:11	En_Passant	That's okay
2016-04-16 18:37:17	@Espyo	inside that, just put the:

2016-04-16 18:40:47	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-16 18:40:47	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-16 18:40:53	@Espyo	on the first line you create the table
2016-04-16 18:40:56	@Espyo	so, on the {|
2016-04-16 18:40:58	Neocraftz1553	but I think those are nessasary
2016-04-16 18:40:59	@Espyo	did you add anything else?
2016-04-16 18:41:03	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-16 18:41:12	En_Passant	No
2016-04-16 18:41:16	@Espyo	like, if you added "class="wikitable"" or something, it will put borders
2016-04-16 18:41:23	@Espyo	so you're telling me it has borders by default?
2016-04-16 18:41:30	@Espyo	eh, probably wikia default style shenanigans
2016-04-16 18:41:33	@Espyo	declare the table like this:
2016-04-16 18:41:40	@Espyo	{| style="border: none;"
2016-04-16 18:41:45	@Espyo	not sure if that'll be enough though...
2016-04-16 18:42:02	En_Passant	Yeah, no...
2016-04-16 18:43:15	@Espyo	you might have to edit your MediaWiki:Common.css page
2016-04-16 18:43:22	@Espyo	and try to find some "border" property there
2016-04-16 18:43:28	@Espyo	which might be making all tables on your wiki become bordered
2016-04-16 18:47:11	@Espyo	oh man
2016-04-16 18:47:14	@Espyo	hazards are JUST working
2016-04-16 18:47:20	@Espyo	they're working flawlessly so far
2016-04-16 18:47:53	En_Passant	oh baby
2016-04-16 18:48:06	Neocraftz1553	hazards? on what?
2016-04-16 18:48:10	@Espyo	engine
2016-04-16 18:48:15	Neocraftz1553	Yessss!
2016-04-16 18:48:27	@Espyo	of course, if you consider a "fire" floor a floor that simply changes the Blue Pikmin's animation to the attack animation, and leaves the Red Pikmin alone a "hazard"
2016-04-16 18:48:31	@Espyo	then yes, "hazards" are working
2016-04-16 18:48:43	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-16 18:48:50	@Espyo	and I'm liking how powerful and simple the system is ending up, too
2016-04-16 18:48:56	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-16 18:49:16	Neocraftz1553	you can never get more powerful than simple... most of the time, anyways
2016-04-16 18:49:40	Neocraftz1553	but, I just probably said something else, but anyways, that is awsome!
2016-04-16 18:49:54	Neocraftz1553	hey, an idea, if you haven't put it in yet
2016-04-16 18:50:10	@Espyo	thanks
2016-04-16 18:50:11	@Espyo	yeah?
2016-04-16 18:54:11	Neocraftz1553	mayne the hazard could change the pikmins leaf top or add something to it, so you know
2016-04-16 18:54:11	Neocraftz1553	add a fire sprite for fire...
2016-04-16 18:54:11	Neocraftz1553	water bubble for water...
2016-04-16 18:54:11	Neocraftz1553	and for others...
2016-04-16 18:54:11	Neocraftz1553	maybe a box or something that says "full body", for electricity
2016-04-16 18:54:11	Neocraftz1553	electricity could stun, so a white colored overlay
2016-04-16 18:54:12	Neocraftz1553	or kill, so a darker overlay
2016-04-16 18:54:12	Neocraftz1553	(btw, full body is a sprite that affects the whole sprite)
2016-04-16 18:54:13	Neocraftz1553	so it has to be the size of the sprite
2016-04-16 18:54:27	@Espyo	of course
2016-04-16 18:54:29	@Espyo	it's all planned
2016-04-16 18:55:29	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-16 18:55:52	Neocraftz1553	hopefully all goes well
2016-04-16 18:56:01	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-16 18:56:31	Neocraftz1553	because once the update is out, pikmin death per playthrough ratio will go sky high
2016-04-16 18:56:54	Neocraftz1553	millions of more pikmin will die :p

2016-04-16 19:35:03	@Espyo	I implemented Pikmin running around in a panic

2016-04-16 19:39:27	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-16 19:39:37	@Espyo	also, I made it so you can set the Pikmin's speed while it is on fire
2016-04-16 19:39:43	@Espyo	so you can just make it go like 10 times as fast
2016-04-16 19:39:45	@Espyo	good luck whistling THAT
2016-04-16 19:42:59	Neocraftz1553	hehehehe
2016-04-16 19:42:59	Neocraftz1553	so, you can make it 10x.... how about 50x?
2016-04-16 19:43:24	@Espyo	you can make it anything you want
2016-04-16 19:43:37	@Espyo	though if you probably set it to be TOO big, the Pikmin will go through walls
2016-04-16 19:43:40	@Espyo	even bigger than that, and it won't move
2016-04-16 19:43:49	@Espyo	since it'll calculate the next position, figure out that it's like MASSIVELY out of bounds, and refuse to move
2016-04-16 19:44:24	En_Passant	like poison reverting your Pikmin's maturity over time
2016-04-16 19:45:19	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-16 19:45:22	@Espyo	I didn't add that, but I can
2016-04-16 19:45:30	@Espyo	should be easy
2016-04-16 19:45:35	@Espyo	but I'll make it lower-priority for now
2016-04-16 19:45:44	@Espyo	remind me to add it some time in the late future
2016-04-16 19:45:45	Neocraftz1553	You could do that in PFE, espyo?
2016-04-16 19:45:46	Neocraftz1553	En_Passant: I used to think that happened in P2, but then they died...
2016-04-16 19:45:49	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-16 19:45:58	@Espyo	do what, Neo?
2016-04-16 19:49:33	Neocraftz1553	Poison
2016-04-16 19:49:36	Neocraftz1553	revrting Pikmin to leaves
2016-04-16 19:50:27	@Espyo	but
2016-04-16 19:50:36	@Espyo	I just specifically said "I didn't add that"
2016-04-16 19:52:47	Neocraftz1553	In Pikmin 2, not in the PFE
2016-04-16 19:53:21	Nvortex	what?
2016-04-16 19:53:32	Nvortex	poison doesn't revert into leaves
2016-04-16 19:53:58	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-16 19:54:03	@Espyo	no, it's not possible in anything at the moment

2016-04-16 21:16:27	@PikFan	it says "Pikumin 3 Bosu Batoru vs Amenyuudou"

2016-04-16 21:43:26	ScruffyChat	from May 4 to May 25 I'm not going to be on, or have very much connection to Pikipedia or Pikmin Fanon, because I will be in South Korea
2016-04-16 21:43:51	En_Passant	Impressive! What for?
2016-04-16 21:44:13	ScruffyChat	Just a family trip, to go sightseeing and absorb some new culture
2016-04-16 21:45:21	ScruffyChat	Same goes for June 29 to July 10, I'll be in Thessaloniki, Greece for a music composition research program
2016-04-16 21:46:04	ScruffyChat	So, I won't be able to do much rendering or music-ing or anything during that time
2016-04-16 21:46:16	ScruffyChat	Well, at least, not Pikmin-related music
2016-04-16 21:47:50	ScruffyChat	So I'll be way behind on stuff by the time I get back twice
2016-04-16 21:49:45	ScruffyChat	But hopefully I can at least start on some of those Nvortex, I'd be happy to

2016-04-16 22:16:08	@PikFan	well, doesn't matter, I'm there anyway
2016-04-16 22:16:10	@Espyo	because we never set it up
2016-04-16 22:16:11	@PikFan	"Intervals between the droplets that fall before the shot hits have been reduced."
2016-04-16 22:16:16	@Espyo	but we had to have set SOMETHING up
2016-04-16 22:16:24	@PikFan	so... in other words, they fire faster now?
2016-04-16 22:16:33	@PikFan	pretty cryptic
2016-04-16 22:16:56	@Espyo	yeah, that one was pretty weird
2016-04-16 22:17:57	ScruffyChat	Does each shot drop little droplets of paint?
2016-04-16 22:18:14	ScruffyChat	As it flies?
2016-04-16 22:18:44	@PikFan	oh, the special gauge reductions are pretty dumb imo
2016-04-16 22:18:48	@Espyo	oh, I guess that's it
2016-04-16 22:18:49	@Espyo	yeah, they do
2016-04-16 22:18:53	@Espyo	I mean
2016-04-16 22:18:58	@Espyo	I never noticed, but I'm pretty sure they do
2016-04-16 22:19:10	@Espyo	since if I shoot forward, it covers the floor below the shot
2016-04-16 22:19:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-16 22:19:31	ScruffyChat	So in that case, it shoots out little droplets more frequently
2016-04-16 22:19:32	@PikFan	oh, I get it now
2016-04-16 22:19:40	@PikFan	therefore inking more ground
2016-04-16 22:19:46	@Espyo	such that I don't need to angle down to paint the floor
2016-04-16 22:19:49	ScruffyChat	And their radius has been increased by 7%
2016-04-16 22:20:10	@PikFan	oh, heh, are you on that page, too?
2016-04-16 22:21:59	ScruffyChat	Yep
2016-04-16 22:22:05	ScruffyChat	Just trying to help
2016-04-16 22:22:17	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-16 22:22:39	@PikFan	but yeah, I think the special gauge reduction adjustments are dumb
2016-04-16 22:23:44	@PikFan	understandably, they don't want special weapons to be farmed as much (for the heavy reduction ones anyway), but still, as someone who uses some of those weapons...
2016-04-16 22:24:21	@PikFan	and swim speed reductions for bigger weapons are also pretty dumb
2016-04-16 22:24:44	@PikFan	physics-wise, it makes sense, but again, it's dumb
2016-04-16 22:26:04	@PikFan	also, how do you feel about the new weapons?
2016-04-16 22:30:05	@Espyo	haven't tried them out yet

2016-04-16 22:55:05	Neocraftz1553	We all have to agree, Testyo is trying to take over our Solar system, starting with Mercury...
2016-04-16 22:55:05	Testyo	guess what, they backed the barc archive into the latter works better
2016-04-16 22:55:32	@PikFan	why take it over when he could destroy it
2016-04-16 22:55:39	Neocraftz1553	Testyo, reveal your plans

This random message came from the messages but when it is about "prove that R \ Z is an open set", where R is a set of all real numbers, and Z is a set of all integers, it becomes rather ridiculous and

2016-04-17 18:26:33	Nvortex	until you kill one, it wont spawn more
2016-04-17 18:26:44	Nvortex	also should that be written on trivia?
2016-04-17 18:28:59	@Espyo	probably not on trivia
2016-04-17 18:29:03	@Espyo	the Phosbat Pod section is so tiny
2016-04-17 18:29:06	@Espyo	it could use all the info it can
2016-04-17 18:29:09	@Espyo	and just write it however

2016-04-17 21:34:46	@Espyo	so either way works
2016-04-17 21:35:11	@PikFan	he's reuploading the videos from nintendo.com and putting them on YT for convenience
2016-04-17 21:35:25	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-04-17 21:35:30	@Espyo	probably an idea that'll get you into trouble
2016-04-17 21:35:32	@Espyo	but sounds good
2016-04-17 21:35:34	@Espyo	good luck
2016-04-17 21:36:11	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-17 21:36:22	UltraMario	that's why im keeping low at first
2016-04-17 21:36:35	UltraMario	keeping them unlisted and such :v
2016-04-17 21:36:48	UltraMario	i havent had any problems so far, so that's good
2016-04-17 21:36:56	UltraMario	i have gotten 2 copyright notices, BUT
2016-04-17 21:37:19	UltraMario	they dont restrict viewing or anything, they just restrict monetization
2016-04-17 21:37:36	UltraMario	which is fine by me. this isn't for profit, this is just for fun. :D
2016-04-17 21:38:52	UltraMario	btw
2016-04-17 21:39:03	UltraMario	the funny thing with that amiibo video is
2016-04-17 21:39:08	UltraMario	noa was lazy with that
2016-04-17 21:39:09	UltraMario	because
2016-04-17 21:39:21	UltraMario	the 30th mario anniversary box says "colour"
2016-04-17 21:39:22	UltraMario	and
2016-04-17 21:39:38	UltraMario	the channel that claimed the video is Nintendo UK
2016-04-17 21:39:38	UltraMario	:V
2016-04-17 21:39:48	UltraMario	so NoA was too lazy to change that

2016-04-17 21:40:27	@PikFan	uh UltraMario, why is the amiibo video the only one with volume
2016-04-17 21:40:53	@PikFan	you said some of them lack audio
2016-04-17 21:40:55	@PikFan	not all of them
2016-04-17 21:41:00	@PikFan	or rather, all minus one
2016-04-17 21:41:35	@PikFan	oh wait
2016-04-17 21:41:44	@PikFan	that weird funky one also has audio
2016-04-17 21:42:24	Cheepy-Cheepy	Testyo
2016-04-17 21:42:24	Testyo	I told Scruffy this but Prod's looking into it
2016-04-17 21:42:35	@PikFan	Testyo lm
2016-04-17 21:42:35	Testyo	I said I told Scruffy this but Prod's looking into it because Cheepy-Cheepy mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages but Prod's looking into it and I told Scruffy this but not you. They were joined by the common word but.
2016-04-17 21:42:36	UltraMario	PikFan: it's not the only video with audio
2016-04-17 21:42:52	@PikFan	no, I realized that

2016-04-17 21:42:56	UltraMario	well
2016-04-17 21:42:58	UltraMario	that's because
2016-04-17 21:43:01	UltraMario	those other videos
2016-04-17 21:43:05	UltraMario	arent like trailers
2016-04-17 21:43:07	UltraMario	or anything
2016-04-17 21:43:18	UltraMario	they're videos embedded throughout  the site
2016-04-17 21:43:21	UltraMario	like webms
2016-04-17 21:43:23	UltraMario	and stuff
2016-04-17 21:43:26	@PikFan	I really don't think people are going to watch those videos...
2016-04-17 21:43:34	UltraMario	oh well
2016-04-17 21:43:34	@PikFan	they're so short and low quality
2016-04-17 21:43:34	UltraMario	:P

2016-04-17 21:44:14	UltraMario	would it be better if i put the videos with audio at the top of the playlist?
2016-04-17 21:44:17	Cheepy-Cheepy	Testyo
2016-04-17 21:44:17	Testyo	I think that's because Nvidia doesn't bother to clear allocated memory for bitmaps?
2016-04-17 21:44:29	@PikFan	yes
2016-04-17 21:44:54	UltraMario	okie dokie
2016-04-17 21:44:55	UltraMario	also

2016-04-17 21:47:27	UltraMario	what i do is
2016-04-17 21:47:36	UltraMario	just use the filename of the video as the title
2016-04-17 21:47:37	UltraMario	:P

2016-04-17 22:05:46	@PikFan	but at the same time, we're also playing with European users

2016-04-17 22:06:17	@PikFan	and the winners of European Splatfests tend to be the most popular AND have the most wins

2016-04-18 16:34:03	Neocraftz1553	Hey Pikfan
2016-04-18 16:34:12	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:ZenGarden2.png
2016-04-18 16:34:16	Neocraftz1553	new change...
2016-04-18 16:34:33	Neocraftz1553	I didn't know they were tree trunks, so I decided to fix that now
2016-04-18 16:34:54	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-04-18 16:35:07	@PikFan	I haven't seen StarWolf in a while
2016-04-18 16:35:08	Neocraftz1553	I'll add in the bridge at a later date, maybe even enemies
2016-04-18 16:35:15	Neocraftz1553	true...
2016-04-18 16:35:56	Neocraftz1553	I tried making the map in blender, but....
2016-04-18 16:36:04	Neocraftz1553	blender wouldn't cooperate
2016-04-18 16:36:07	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-04-18 16:36:17	Neocraftz1553	lets just say it crashed every few clicks
2016-04-18 16:36:21	@PikFan	yeah, might be something a little out of your grasp
2016-04-18 16:36:35	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-18 16:36:45	Neocraftz1553	Areas are a little too complex....
2016-04-18 16:36:47	@PikFan	brb
2016-04-18 16:36:52	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-04-18 16:37:35	@PikFan	back
2016-04-18 16:37:48	@PikFan	my friend came into the library, even though she has class
2016-04-18 16:37:54	@PikFan	and she just explained to me why
2016-04-18 16:39:22	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-18 16:39:51	Neocraftz1553	so, you were back pretty quick
2016-04-18 16:40:18	Neocraftz1553	hey Pikfan, you know who RF-Sleep is?
2016-04-18 16:40:23	@PikFan	nope
2016-04-18 16:40:33	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-04-18 16:40:41	@PikFan	oh, it's RingtailedFox
2016-04-18 16:40:48	@PikFan	the guy who never talks
2016-04-18 16:41:00	Neocraftz1553	and he's here most of the time
2016-04-18 16:41:09	Neocraftz1553	what about smuckola?
2016-04-18 16:41:35	Neocraftz1553	AFK all day...
2016-04-18 16:41:44	@PikFan	oh, he used to talk
2016-04-18 16:41:48	@PikFan	now, not so much
2016-04-18 16:41:58	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-18 16:42:16	Neocraftz1553	surprising Yoshi2 is still offline...
2016-04-18 16:44:05	Neocraftz1553	So, I was watching some 4chan twitch raids last night...
2016-04-18 16:44:41	Neocraftz1553	and they mostly convince people to delete system32 or run the ayyy lmao virus and stuff like that....
2016-04-18 16:44:41	@PikFan	heh, fun
2016-04-18 16:44:46	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-18 16:44:58	Neocraftz1553	toothpaste on keyboard, anyone?
2016-04-18 16:45:05	@PikFan	lolwut
2016-04-18 16:45:24	Neocraftz1553	I still can't find this one video, that got blocked...
2016-04-18 16:45:48	Neocraftz1553	They convince this kid to delete system32, then the fun begins
2016-04-18 16:46:13	@PikFan	what's system32
2016-04-18 16:46:25	@PikFan	is it like a critical program or something
2016-04-18 16:46:49	Neocraftz1553	They do this and that, and somewhere along the line they convince him to put salt water all over the motherboard(salt water is an almost 110% kill to any electrical conponent)
2016-04-18 16:47:01	Neocraftz1553	Pikfan: It's a VERY critical program
2016-04-18 16:47:03	Neocraftz1553	on windows
2016-04-18 16:47:19	Neocraftz1553	It lets it run
2016-04-18 16:47:29	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-18 16:47:33	@PikFan	what jerks
2016-04-18 16:47:44	Neocraftz1553	without it, the computer won't work or BSOD
2016-04-18 16:47:47	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-18 16:48:01	Neocraftz1553	after the water dousing, guess what?
2016-04-18 16:48:10	@PikFan	it's broken
2016-04-18 16:48:12	@PikFan	amirite?
2016-04-18 16:48:13	Neocraftz1553	they take it even farther
2016-04-18 16:48:16	@PikFan	what
2016-04-18 16:48:17	@PikFan	what
2016-04-18 16:48:18	@PikFan	what
2016-04-18 16:48:18	@PikFan	why
2016-04-18 16:48:19	@PikFan	why
2016-04-18 16:48:20	@PikFan	why
2016-04-18 16:48:46	Neocraftz1553	they convince the kid to put it over an oven to "De-fry the microchips"
2016-04-18 16:48:57	@PikFan	okay
2016-04-18 16:49:01	@PikFan	how old is this kid
2016-04-18 16:49:06	@PikFan	because this kid is an idiot
2016-04-18 16:49:31	Neocraftz1553	and then they make him take the battery out, slather it in butter, wrap it in aluminum, and microwave it until it catches fire
2016-04-18 16:49:38	Neocraftz1553	Ik, right?
2016-04-18 16:49:39	@PikFan	:|
2016-04-18 16:49:55	@PikFan	that kid is such an idiot
2016-04-18 16:50:07	Neocraftz1553	you'd think he'd stop after deleteing system32,but he's way too trusting
2016-04-18 16:50:07	@PikFan	how old is he?
2016-04-18 16:50:19	Neocraftz1553	he looks like 10 or something
2016-04-18 16:50:27	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-18 16:50:29	@PikFan	so dumb
2016-04-18 16:50:41	@PikFan	tell Espyo about it, I'm sure he'd have a good laugh
2016-04-18 16:50:52	Neocraftz1553	then they convince him (somehow) to break his Xbox 360
2016-04-18 16:51:05	Neocraftz1553	I'm trying to find the video
2016-04-18 16:51:18	@PikFan	wait is it this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcg8DEOly7Q
2016-04-18 16:51:18	Neocraftz1553	like I said, youtube blocked it a long time ago
2016-04-18 16:51:31	@PikFan	or is it a different one
2016-04-18 16:51:50	Neocraftz1553	hmm... hold up, let me check
2016-04-18 16:52:01	Neocraftz1553	eh, no
2016-04-18 16:52:36	Neocraftz1553	after deleteing system32, the computer won't work, and its like it's turned off
2016-04-18 16:52:49	Neocraftz1553	then the victim is left to think about their actions
2016-04-18 16:53:10	Neocraftz1553	but the 4chans made him take out his phone and skype the whole thing
2016-04-18 16:53:27	@PikFan	hey Neo
2016-04-18 16:53:30	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-18 16:53:33	@PikFan	can we destroy 4chan?
2016-04-18 16:53:46	Neocraftz1553	theres too many of 'em, though
2016-04-18 16:54:01	Neocraftz1553	and they have relations with Anonymous
2016-04-18 16:54:09	@PikFan	I think it'd be fun to give them a lot of DDoS's and other crap
2016-04-18 16:54:22	Neocraftz1553	trust me, you don't want to mess with Anonymous...
2016-04-18 16:54:27	Neocraftz1553	DDoS's?
2016-04-18 16:54:49	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see
2016-04-18 16:56:05	Neocraftz1553	you know what the ayyy lmao virus does?
2016-04-18 16:57:15	Neocraftz1553	fills up your computer with a nasty case of duplicate files, filling up your memory and possibly BSOD-ing you. It then emails all your passwords and usernames to the creator....
2016-04-18 16:57:21	Neocraftz1553	because why the fuck not?
2016-04-18 16:57:33	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-18 16:57:41	@PikFan	that's crazy
2016-04-18 16:57:46	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-18 16:58:04	Neocraftz1553	I think someone at 4chan made it, to be honest...
2016-04-18 16:59:13	Neocraftz1553	wait, wtf?
2016-04-18 16:59:27	Neocraftz1553	"So this kid got the Ayy LMAO virus and we fixed with the new gloryholefoundation or Help Desk Corporate ..."
2016-04-18 16:59:41	@PikFan	what the
2016-04-18 17:00:19	Neocraftz1553	and heres a video on the virus(I think)

2016-04-18 17:03:35	Neocraftz1553	Oh, watched something like this last night: TWITCH RAIDS: Kid gets grounded over System32 virus and porn
2016-04-18 17:03:49	Neocraftz1553	(btw, don't get excited, there no porn)
2016-04-18 17:04:17	Neocraftz1553	You know how theres the chat bar on the right of twitch?
2016-04-18 17:04:28	@PikFan	lolwut
2016-04-18 17:04:30	@PikFan	also:
2016-04-18 17:04:32	@PikFan	"That timetable makes sense in terms of Nintendo needing to replace the struggling Wii U as soon as possible."
2016-04-18 17:04:37	@PikFan	no no no no no no no
2016-04-18 17:04:38	@PikFan	sto
2016-04-18 17:04:39	@PikFan	p
2016-04-18 17:04:41	@PikFan	just shut up
2016-04-18 17:04:51	Neocraftz1553	the kids dad sees it and people start typing "HE SHOWED US CHILD PORNO!!"
2016-04-18 17:04:57	Chiaki_Nanami	hi
2016-04-18 17:04:57	@PikFan	the NX will NOT be coming out this year
2016-04-18 17:04:59	Chiaki_Nanami	what accent
2016-04-18 17:05:05	Neocraftz1553	hi Chiaki
2016-04-18 17:05:12	@PikFan	I can't understand why people insist the NX will come out this year
2016-04-18 17:05:16	@PikFan	it WON'T
2016-04-18 17:05:17	Neocraftz1553	wait, the NX won't?
2016-04-18 17:05:17	Chiaki_Nanami	hi neo
2016-04-18 17:05:21	Chiaki_Nanami	pikfan
2016-04-18 17:05:26	@PikFan	hi Chiaki_Nanami
2016-04-18 17:05:30	@PikFan	sorry, I'm ranting
2016-04-18 17:05:35	@PikFan	about this trash article
2016-04-18 17:05:35	Chiaki_Nanami	I think that's the theory floating about due to Reggie saying something like
2016-04-18 17:05:49	Chiaki_Nanami	'we'll talk more about this next year'
2016-04-18 17:05:55	Chiaki_Nanami	during last year's E3
2016-04-18 17:06:01	@PikFan	yeah, mayve
2016-04-18 17:06:04	@PikFan	*maybe
2016-04-18 17:06:19	@PikFan	people say "oh the Wii U's doing bad, Nintendo needs to get rid of it ASAP"
2016-04-18 17:06:21	@PikFan	no they don't
2016-04-18 17:06:27	Chiaki_Nanami	which is literally the only thing we know about it at the moment
2016-04-18 17:06:33	Neocraftz1553	the Wii U is struggling because Nintendo didn't let it out for more than 2 years
2016-04-18 17:06:39	Chiaki_Nanami	nah
2016-04-18 17:06:41	Neocraftz1553	aaaand Pikmin 3 got put off shelves
2016-04-18 17:06:43	Chiaki_Nanami	it's the name
2016-04-18 17:06:48	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-18 17:06:59	Chiaki_Nanami	I'm telling you, a lot of lost sales is due to moronic naming of the console
2016-04-18 17:07:00	@PikFan	there's so many things that we could blame
2016-04-18 17:07:09	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-18 17:07:12	@PikFan	but yeah, the name's part of it
2016-04-18 17:07:12	Chiaki_Nanami	and not enough indication that it was a new thing
2016-04-18 17:07:28	@PikFan	at least Kimishima recognized that by saying "we're moving on from the Wii brand"
2016-04-18 17:07:35	Neocraftz1553	at least its not the "Wii 2" or the "WII"...
2016-04-18 17:07:40	Chiaki_Nanami	no
2016-04-18 17:07:47	Chiaki_Nanami	'Wii 2' would have been better than 'Wii U'
2016-04-18 17:07:55	Chiaki_Nanami	it's the standard that Sony is using
2016-04-18 17:07:56	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-18 17:07:58	Chiaki_Nanami	it would have worked
2016-04-18 17:08:04	@PikFan	fuck standards
2016-04-18 17:08:08	Neocraftz1553	but I couldn't care less...
2016-04-18 17:08:58	Neocraftz1553	I would have bought it(if I hadn't gotten lazy and made money) be it the Wii U, Wii 2, or something even more moronic
2016-04-18 17:09:08	@PikFan	"Consoles almost never release that quickly after a reveal, including Nintendo’s own."
2016-04-18 17:09:15	@PikFan	YEAH, YA THINK?!?!?!?
2016-04-18 17:09:33	@PikFan	that is EXACTLY why it won't release this year!
2016-04-18 17:09:42	@PikFan	oh my god...
2016-04-18 17:10:07	Chiaki_Nanami	nintendo pls give new good metroid
2016-04-18 17:10:19	Neocraftz1553	but they forget the "New" 3Ds
2016-04-18 17:10:30	Neocraftz1553	it kinda replaced the Wii U, more or less...
2016-04-18 17:10:45	Chiaki_Nanami	the last good Metroid game was Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, which was released 12 years ago
2016-04-18 17:10:56	Neocraftz1553	Hey, I play that!
2016-04-18 17:10:59	Neocraftz1553	on a GC
2016-04-18 17:11:03	Chiaki_Nanami	did you like it
2016-04-18 17:11:07	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-18 17:11:09	Chiaki_Nanami	yay
2016-04-18 17:11:13	@PikFan	let's not talk about Federation Force...
2016-04-18 17:11:17	@PikFan	oops
2016-04-18 17:11:22	Chiaki_Nanami	more like
2016-04-18 17:11:29	Chiaki_Nanami	let's not talk about Othe--- *shot*
2016-04-18 17:11:36	Neocraftz1553	I liked the first one as well, Metroid Prime
2016-04-18 17:12:22	Neocraftz1553	I put it off for a while, until I realized: Metroid. Samus. THIS GAME /MUST/ SAMUS!
2016-04-18 17:12:26	Neocraftz1553	OH MY GOD
2016-04-18 17:12:29	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-18 17:12:45	Neocraftz1553	*must be about samus
2016-04-18 17:13:01	Chiaki_Nanami	i have a friend of mine who refuses to play prime because 'it looks weird'
2016-04-18 17:13:08	Chiaki_Nanami	it's a bad argument
2016-04-18 17:13:11	Chiaki_Nanami	a very bad argument
2016-04-18 17:13:20	Neocraftz1553	^thats why I put it off :/...
2016-04-18 17:13:28	Neocraftz1553	not the gameplay
2016-04-18 17:13:32	Neocraftz1553	let me explain
2016-04-18 17:13:55	Neocraftz1553	I only got the disc by itself so I thought it was going to be some sort of basketball game...
2016-04-18 17:14:13	Neocraftz1553	the disc art looked like a basketball
2016-04-18 17:14:26	Chiaki_Nanami	what
2016-04-18 17:14:30	Neocraftz1553	but as soon as I played it, it was freaking awsome
2016-04-18 17:14:38	Neocraftz1553	loved the Scan visor
2016-04-18 17:14:53	Chiaki_Nanami	I love how the game uses /the entire controller/

2016-04-18 17:19:56	En_Passant	hi
2016-04-18 17:20:20	@PikFan	so, you just missed my rant about the NX
2016-04-18 17:20:39	En_Passant	Have they announced anything about that yet?
2016-04-18 17:20:56	@PikFan	nope, just rumors and such
2016-04-18 17:21:02	@PikFan	but I swear
2016-04-18 17:21:20	@PikFan	lots of people on the internet keep insisting the NX will release this year
2016-04-18 17:21:26	@PikFan	except it's not
2016-04-18 17:21:45	@PikFan	because if it did, that would end up being a rushed launch
2016-04-18 17:21:49	@PikFan	just like the Wii U was
2016-04-18 17:22:22	@PikFan	they keep saying "the Wii U's a failure and 
2016-04-18 17:22:29	@PikFan	Nintendo needs to get rid of it ASAP"
2016-04-18 17:22:34	@PikFan	(gah, enter key...)
2016-04-18 17:23:33	@PikFan	but yeah, it just makes me upset that people are bashing the Wii U like that
2016-04-18 17:23:45	En_Passant	The Wii U's not even that bad
2016-04-18 17:23:49	@PikFan	saying it needs to be replaced quickly, like nobody cares about it
2016-04-18 17:23:52	@PikFan	/exactly/
2016-04-18 17:23:59	@PikFan	but the only thing people look at are sales
2016-04-18 17:24:12	@PikFan	"oh, bad sales? then it's a bad console"
2016-04-18 17:24:13	Chiaki_Nanami	we live in a capitalist society
2016-04-18 17:24:22	En_Passant	^
2016-04-18 17:24:29	Chiaki_Nanami	the only thing that matters is money
2016-04-18 17:24:30	En_Passant	To a business, sales is what matters
2016-04-18 17:24:36	@PikFan	we?
2016-04-18 17:24:39	Chiaki_Nanami	if it isn't generating money, it's worthless
2016-04-18 17:24:43	@PikFan	I thought you lived in Sweden?
2016-04-18 17:25:02	Chiaki_Nanami	were you under the assumption that capitalism isn't in Sweden
2016-04-18 17:25:06	Chiaki_Nanami	and that we're super socialist
2016-04-18 17:25:09	En_Passant	lol
2016-04-18 17:25:14	Chiaki_Nanami	that the government controls everything
2016-04-18 17:25:14	@PikFan	no, not super socialist
2016-04-18 17:25:17	Chiaki_Nanami	fun fact that is wrong
2016-04-18 17:25:19	@PikFan	but just not capitalist
2016-04-18 17:25:24	Chiaki_Nanami	there is capitalism in Sweden
2016-04-18 17:25:44	--	Yoshi2|offline is now known as Yoshi2
2016-04-18 17:25:49	@PikFan	I thought Europe was moving away from capitalism and going towards socialism
2016-04-18 17:25:55	@PikFan	not socialism like USSR
2016-04-18 17:26:09	@PikFan	but like...uh, democratic socialism, or whatever that's called?
2016-04-18 17:26:09	Chiaki_Nanami	the term you are searching for is democratic socialism
2016-04-18 17:26:11	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-04-18 17:26:42	@PikFan	I think it's dumb that the Wii U's being shitted on because of sales
2016-04-18 17:26:56	@PikFan	besides, Nintendo has SO
2016-04-18 17:26:57	@PikFan	MUCH
2016-04-18 17:26:58	@PikFan	MONEY
2016-04-18 17:27:13	En_Passant	Does it?
2016-04-18 17:27:16	Chiaki_Nanami	according to a semi-recent article on the Economist, Europe is starting to move away from the centre-left
2016-04-18 17:27:29	@PikFan	huh, interesting
2016-04-18 17:27:39	@PikFan	I guess American media is biased
2016-04-18 17:27:54	En_Passant	uh, yeah
2016-04-18 17:28:02	Yoshi2	capitalism isn't really a political system anyway
2016-04-18 17:28:55	En_Passant	True, but economic systems are related to government involvement in them
2016-04-18 17:29:53	@PikFan	well, I'm seeing an article from 2014 saying that Nintendo was worth $18 billion back then
2016-04-18 17:30:02	@PikFan	but I'm not finding anything about its worth right now
2016-04-18 17:30:16	@PikFan	but still, $18 billion's a lot
2016-04-18 17:30:52	@PikFan	so I dare say that even if the NX did worse than the Wii U, Nintendo could still keep going
2016-04-18 17:30:54	Chiaki_Nanami	pikfant
2016-04-18 17:30:58	Chiaki_Nanami	the thing about america is

2016-04-18 17:31:06	@PikFan	it wouldn't be good for anyone
2016-04-18 17:31:16	@PikFan	lololololol
2016-04-18 17:31:20	Chiaki_Nanami	you have far-far-right and somewhat right
2016-04-18 17:31:24	@PikFan	there's plenty of left here
2016-04-18 17:31:35	@PikFan	unless if your right is my left
2016-04-18 17:31:38	Chiaki_Nanami	in my eyes, Bernie Sanders is a centre-right politician
2016-04-18 17:31:55	En_Passant	How so?
2016-04-18 17:32:09	@PikFan	but that's a discussion for another time
2016-04-18 17:32:32	@PikFan	I'm still thinking that the NX will release in 2017
2016-04-18 17:32:33	Chiaki_Nanami	his platform is not radical
2016-04-18 17:32:36	Chiaki_Nanami	at all
2016-04-18 17:32:42	@PikFan	no matter what anyone says
2016-04-18 17:32:49	Chiaki_Nanami	he wants you to join the rest of the industrialised world
2016-04-18 17:33:09	@PikFan	and I won't believe anything anyone says until an OFFICIAL announcement
2016-04-18 17:33:36	Yoshi2	2016 is theoretically possible
2016-04-18 17:33:41	Yoshi2	2017 is definitely possible
2016-04-18 17:33:46	@PikFan	^
2016-04-18 17:34:09	En_Passant	People shouldn't even talk about it until that announcement tbh. It's all mass guessing until then
2016-04-18 17:34:21	@PikFan	fat chance of that
2016-04-18 17:34:33	@PikFan	people love speculation
2016-04-18 17:34:52	@PikFan	they'd rather have something to talk about instead of nothing
2016-04-18 17:35:08	@PikFan	and the internet multiplies that by a LOT
2016-04-18 17:35:30	@PikFan	but you probably knew that already

2016-04-18 19:25:59	ScruffyChat	By the way, I think in the Gate article we should mention the stone walls that can only be destroyed by iron balls

2016-04-18 19:26:59	@Espyo	I read it as crystal walls

2016-04-18 19:48:47	Marty2000	Hey, do you remember the "uncontrollable Pikmin" glitch ? I tried it in Bingo battle and I noticed this : 
2016-04-18 19:48:50	Marty2000	Uncontrollable Pikmin can't be noticed by enemies, so they can't be attacked by other Pikmin as well. However, they can still die when attacking a Pikmin, even if the latter doesn't attack.
2016-04-18 19:49:06	Marty2000	Strange, sin't it?
2016-04-18 19:49:09	Marty2000	isn't it?*

2016-04-18 20:39:17	Marty2000	It seems that plants have more important roles in Pikmin. After the "throwing yellow Pikmin higher" trick (in P1 and P2), they can  be used to stop a dodge in Pikmin 3

2016-04-18 22:05:08	Nvortex	marty all of the pikmin 3 pictures here are from wikia
2016-04-18 22:05:15	@Espyo	hm, I thought we had that image already, but we don't
2016-04-18 22:05:18	@Espyo	not sure if we should have it
2016-04-18 22:05:28	Nvortex	and i'm not sure if the slurker one is different, its from the 12.5.12 direct
2016-04-18 22:05:50	Nvortex	i set it for deletion because there was already a picture showcasing the uvula attack
2016-04-18 22:06:14	UltraMario	i recently tried registering at press.nintendo.com
2016-04-18 22:06:16	UltraMario	:O

2016-04-18 22:06:28	UltraMario	hopefully they accept me
2016-04-18 22:06:30	Marty2000	I think I could add the red leader here : http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_3_prerelease_information
2016-04-18 22:06:41	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-18 22:06:42	UltraMario	i want access to high quality artwork
2016-04-18 22:06:50	@Espyo	although there are already some images of the red leader there

2016-04-18 22:08:07	UltraMario	;-;
2016-04-18 22:08:11	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/7/7a/Ue6.png I think this one should definitely be used
2016-04-18 22:08:21	@Espyo	I don't know any level in the final game that has THAT many DSK
2016-04-18 22:08:24	UltraMario	i wish there was a guest login
2016-04-18 22:08:30	@Espyo	or at least so many dead leaves with some DSK
2016-04-18 22:08:36	UltraMario	like there was for a bunch of e3s
2016-04-18 22:09:31	UltraMario	oh well
2016-04-18 22:09:31	UltraMario	;-;
2016-04-18 22:09:44	UltraMario	rip me having access to high quality artwork

2016-04-18 22:09:51	Nvortex	what the
2016-04-18 22:09:56	Nvortex	i was sure that was being used
2016-04-18 22:10:07	@Espyo	you marked it for deletion, so :|
2016-04-18 22:10:20	Nvortex	when did the pictures change?
2016-04-18 22:10:36	@Espyo	change? how so?
2016-04-18 22:11:27	Nvortex	i don't know if it happened in the merge or something (but that was ages ago...) but there used to be more pictures in the galleries
2016-04-18 22:11:31	Nvortex	like the slurker one
2016-04-18 22:11:48	UltraMario	well
2016-04-18 22:12:01	UltraMario	i guess i could always use pidgiwiki for high quality rips
2016-04-18 22:12:01	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-18 22:12:08	UltraMario	that place is helpful
2016-04-18 22:12:20	Nvortex	and the skitter leaves was being used to, i don't know what happened, maybe a similar one is being used somewhere and i confused them
2016-04-18 22:12:27	Nvortex	i will have to dobule check what i set for deletion
2016-04-18 22:12:30	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-18 22:14:28	Nvortex	<Espyo>: I don't know any level in the final game that has THAT many DSK 
2016-04-18 22:14:33	Nvortex	it's from the early trailers
2016-04-18 22:14:42	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-18 22:14:45	Nvortex	they got replaced by orange bulborbs and dwarf orange bulborbs
2016-04-18 22:14:46	@Espyo	do we have that documented on the wiki?
2016-04-18 22:14:54	Nvortex	no
2016-04-18 22:14:57	Nvortex	do i add that?
2016-04-18 22:15:01	UltraMario	espyo amirite about pidgiwiki though
2016-04-18 22:15:02	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-18 22:15:42	@Espyo	it's been ages since I've went to pidgiwiki
2016-04-18 22:15:44	@Espyo	but try it
2016-04-18 22:15:48	@Espyo	Nvortex: yeah, add it
2016-04-18 22:16:00	@Espyo	the [[Pikmin 3 prerelease information]] page needs a bit of love all around, actually
2016-04-18 22:16:00	Testyo	"Pikmin_3_prerelease_information" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_3_prerelease_information
2016-04-18 22:16:04	@Espyo	it's good, but it's kinda incomplete and weird
2016-04-18 22:16:16	Nvortex	by the way this is set for deletion because of the god awful quality http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin3FlintBeetle.png
2016-04-18 22:16:28	@Espyo	yikes, yeah
2016-04-18 22:16:33	@Espyo	but I left it because, again, DerpAlph
2016-04-18 22:16:41	@Espyo	but if we have enough images, and that one doesn't show anything else
2016-04-18 22:16:45	@Espyo	then yeah, it can be deleted
2016-04-18 22:17:05	Nvortex	but alph still looks bad there, he looks better in the skitter leaves one
2016-04-18 22:17:05	@Espyo	luckily, everything will be a LOT smoother with Pikmin 4
2016-04-18 22:17:10	@Espyo	I've already got plans for where images should go
2016-04-18 22:17:17	@Espyo	so that when we need to compare prerelease stuff later, it'll be easy
2016-04-18 22:17:23	@Espyo	right, I get you
2016-04-18 22:17:37	@Espyo	other than that, I can't really see anything else that's important in that image
2016-04-18 22:17:43	@Espyo	so I guess I'll delete it
2016-04-18 22:17:45	Nvortex	i think this should be deleted too http://www.pikminwiki.com/Yellow_Mecha_Bulborb
2016-04-18 22:18:03	@Espyo	we need to decide what to do to Pikmin Adventure enemy info, first
2016-04-18 22:18:17	@Espyo	all in one article? all on the game's article? all on different articles? different behavior for bosses?
2016-04-18 22:18:22	Nvortex	and this http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:DSK.jpg i don't understand at all why they took pictures of the name
2016-04-18 22:18:24	Marty2000	General article ?
2016-04-18 22:18:35	Nvortex	and it's not the only one
2016-04-18 22:18:45	@Espyo	I left that one for a reason I can't remember now...
2016-04-18 22:18:56	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-18 22:19:04	@Espyo	might've been for us to double-check the Koppaite text
2016-04-18 22:19:08	@Espyo	[[Koppaite text]]

2016-04-18 22:21:09	@Espyo	seems to be the same
2016-04-18 22:21:13	@Espyo	I'll go ahead and delete that image
2016-04-18 22:22:12	Nvortex	how would you describe derpy alph's face?
2016-04-18 22:22:51	@Espyo	uhm
2016-04-18 22:22:53	@Espyo	early |:
2016-04-18 22:23:43	UltraMario	pidgiwiki is still alive, just not super active
2016-04-18 22:26:00	@Espyo	...github, please
2016-04-18 22:26:05	@Espyo	I clicked the fork button to get a list of forks
2016-04-18 22:26:10	@Espyo	and instead it just created a fork for myself
2016-04-18 22:26:15	@Espyo	without even asking me details or anything
2016-04-18 22:26:24	@Espyo	it just created an entire repository at the click of an accidental button

2016-04-18 22:34:59	@Espyo	yeah, but the style "rules" says you put italic again
2016-04-18 22:35:02	@Espyo	which un-italicizes
2016-04-18 22:35:25	@Espyo	it's weird, but it's the same style a lot of things use it
2016-04-18 22:35:40	@Espyo	come to think of it, the weirdest place I remember seeing this
2016-04-18 22:35:43	@Espyo	is in movie subtitles

2016-04-18 22:43:14	@Espyo	there are images that show him better

2016-04-18 23:32:01	ScruffyChat	I really should focus more on reworking enemies and treasures that appear though
2016-04-18 23:32:31	ScruffyChat	I'd really like to do what PikFan suggested and get rid of one cave, and scatter its treasures around the overworld
2016-04-18 23:32:40	ScruffyChat	in various new puzzles/challenges
2016-04-18 23:32:57	ScruffyChat	But that's going to take an awful lot of crashes

2016-04-19 00:07:15	@PikFan	hey ScruffyChat, I /massively/ reworked the section in Chapter 6 after Ignis wakes up
2016-04-19 00:07:30	@PikFan	I realized what I was writing wasn't fitting his characterization at all
2016-04-19 00:07:48	ScruffyChat	Hey!
2016-04-19 00:07:49	@PikFan	so instead, he's not terrified at all, but just surprised

2016-04-19 00:47:52	@PikFan	oh, so my physics teacher told me today that I should go into theoretical physics
2016-04-19 00:48:20	@PikFan	because I keep asking her questions about quantum physics, time travel, etc etc, all of which are way beyond the scope of the class
2016-04-19 00:48:26	@PikFan	not to mention, her expertise
2016-04-19 00:48:35	@PikFan	up till now, I thought I'd do astrophysics
2016-04-19 00:48:52	@PikFan	and now, I realized I'm also very into theoretical physics, too
2016-04-19 00:49:19	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2016-04-19 00:49:29	Nvortex	you guys should watch stenins;gate
2016-04-19 00:49:41	@PikFan	quantum physics, time travel, dark matter, fate of the universe...
2016-04-19 00:49:46	@PikFan	I'm interested in all of that
2016-04-19 00:50:10	Nvortex	specially scruffy, he said sometime that he liked alternate dimemnsions and stuf (or something like that...hyperdimensional?)
2016-04-19 00:51:03	ScruffyChat	nice
2016-04-19 00:51:20	ScruffyChat	All that stuff is interesting to me, yeah
2016-04-19 00:51:30	Neocraftz1553	Yup
2016-04-19 00:51:33	ScruffyChat	I'm happy to discuss any of it if you're interested
2016-04-19 00:51:47	Neocraftz1553	It is fairly intresting
2016-04-19 00:53:58	@PikFan	well, okay
2016-04-19 00:54:03	@PikFan	gravitons: real or not?
2016-04-19 00:54:08	Nvortex	well steins;gate has it's own kind of....logic about time travel and alternate dimensions
2016-04-19 00:54:38	Nvortex	i don't want to get to much into detail because if you go in knowing nothing it makes it better
2016-04-19 00:55:09	Nvortex	the visual novel is, obviously, the superior version but the anime is regarded as one of the bests
2016-04-19 00:55:45	Nvortex	heck steins;gate scored more than back to the future as a time travel series
2016-04-19 00:56:31	Nvortex	Doctor Who TV gave the Steins Gate anime series a score of 25 out of 30, stating that "the episodes are both emotionally driven, as well as fantastically imaginative", the "characters are diverse," it "manages to balance humor and serious perfectly" and "features the biggest Rewatch Bonus of any show";they rated it higher than other time-travel fiction 
2016-04-19 00:56:46	Nvortex	such as Back to the Future, Future Diary, Quantum Leap, Shadow of Memories, The Time Machine, Life on Mars, The Terminator, Heroes and Groundhog Day.
2016-04-19 00:57:21	@PikFan	why is there a semicolon in the title
2016-04-19 00:57:22	@PikFan	what
2016-04-19 00:57:27	@PikFan	this breaks my brain
2016-04-19 00:57:34	Nvortex	oh
2016-04-19 00:57:51	Nvortex	its like the "signature" of the creator
2016-04-19 00:58:14	@PikFan	huh
2016-04-19 00:58:31	Nvortex	and im serious when i tell you, dont read anything of it, go completely blind
2016-04-19 00:58:54	Nvortex	the first 2 episodes are god awful (character introduction) but you CAN'T skip them
2016-04-19 00:58:56	Neocraftz1553	Noooooooo
2016-04-19 00:59:04	Neocraftz1553	I erased a whole damn level....
2016-04-19 00:59:13	Nvortex	it keeps getting progresively better each episode
2016-04-19 00:59:26	Neocraftz1553	Text file on the PFE, Zen garden
2016-04-19 01:00:03	ScruffyChat	that's a lot of sci-fi/fantasy works to beat
2016-04-19 01:00:11	@PikFan	ouch, Neo
2016-04-19 01:02:01	Nvortex	just proves how perfect it is
2016-04-19 01:03:12	ScruffyChat	Sounds like a good watch, I love time travel fiction
2016-04-19 01:03:15	Nvortex	and when you finish watching the anime, http://allaboutsteinsgate.host56.com/
2016-04-19 01:03:56	Nvortex	by the way this isnt a "the world is in danger, lets get in the time machine and save the world"
2016-04-19 01:04:00	Nvortex	that doesnt work here
2016-04-19 01:04:56	Nvortex	the show has its own time travel logic, i gotta admit, it took me a while to actually like it
2016-04-19 01:05:00	Nvortex	but its good nonetheless
2016-04-19 01:07:01	Nvortex	oh and when you are watching it, skip episode 23 β
2016-04-19 01:07:11	Nvortex	once you finish watching it, watch it
2016-04-19 01:07:31	ScruffyChat	By the way PikFan, I'm skeptical about gravitons
2016-04-19 01:07:58	@PikFan	maybe they're real
2016-04-19 01:08:03	@PikFan	maybe they're not
2016-04-19 01:08:13	@PikFan	but I can understand your skepticism
2016-04-19 01:08:30	Neocraftz1553	On the bright side, put onions in the same location and they act like the onions from Pikmin 3
2016-04-19 01:08:45	Nvortex	didn't they discover that gravity is a wave some time ago?
2016-04-19 01:09:04	@PikFan	gravitational waves, yep
2016-04-19 01:10:04	Nvortex	ugh...i don't like talking about steins;gate because i get hyped and cant stop talking about it... /luckily/ there is a steins;gate discord chat
2016-04-19 01:10:20	ScruffyChat	But gravitational waves are an effect of gravity, not a cause for gravity
2016-04-19 01:13:08	Nvortex	oh i just remembered, steins;gate really goes into the conspiracy stuff, john titor's scam and the CERN's black hole fiasco are a recurrent thing
2016-04-19 01:13:30	Nvortex	actually CERN is a plot element

2016-04-19 02:30:03	Neocraftz1553	Flowers the size of a Size 8 Soccerball
2016-04-19 02:30:19	Neocraftz1553	The size of a dinnerplate?
2016-04-19 02:30:24	Neocraftz1553	something like that
2016-04-19 02:32:36	Nvortex	i hope you have mosquito nets on your windows
2016-04-19 02:32:54	Neocraftz1553	Thankfully, yes
2016-04-19 02:33:20	Neocraftz1553	Can't have these HUGE black bees stabbing me in my sleep...
2016-04-19 02:34:10	Neocraftz1553	They get agitated easily, so if they see you by a window, they will start latching onto your window, mosquito bet, or if you are unlucky, yourself

2016-04-19 02:38:53	Neocraftz1553	Hilariousness galore
2016-04-19 02:39:43	Neocraftz1553	The neighbors Chihuahua ran towards a bee that had landed on the ground bit it, and got stung
2016-04-19 02:41:18	Neocraftz1553	It was a huge bee too, so that must've been painful
2016-04-19 02:43:58	Neocraftz1553	brb, I might not return until later

2016-04-19 06:46:34	Neocraftz1553	thats pretty unlikely
2016-04-19 06:48:48	Yoshi2	unless it's quite a bit of alcohol, it shouldn't have much of an effect 
2016-04-19 06:50:18	Yoshi2	otherwise food with a few drops of alcohol would get you drunk
2016-04-19 06:51:04	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-19 06:52:22	Neocraftz1553	rubbing alcohol is bad, don't try that...

2016-04-19 06:55:31	UltraMario	one of my problems of was how for multiplayer you needed a gba
2016-04-19 06:55:41	RingtailedFox	they would never have money probems again
2016-04-19 06:56:00	UltraMario	they could utilize the gamepad like the gba in the original
2016-04-19 06:56:01	Yoshi2	UltraMario you are not a true nintendo fan unless you bought 4 gbas for all your friends to play fsa with
2016-04-19 06:56:06	UltraMario	pls

2016-04-19 06:58:59	Yoshi2	and I recently found my memory card again

2016-04-19 06:59:51	Yoshi2	why do you have 7 GCs
2016-04-19 06:59:52	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see

2016-04-19 07:00:40	Neocraftz1553	but seriously, I'm not sure why the hell I have 7
2016-04-19 07:00:53	Yoshi2	not sure, but it wasn't a big memory card
2016-04-19 07:01:13	Neocraftz1553	I HAD 12, then I sold 3 °-°
2016-04-19 07:01:32	Neocraftz1553	after that, not sure where two of 'em ended up

2016-04-19 07:03:40	Yoshi2	either the analog stick is loose, or the right shoulder button doesn't click

2016-04-19 18:49:31	@Espyo	depends on the guy you're talking about
2016-04-19 18:50:23	Klemen702	the rabbit guy?
2016-04-19 18:50:30	Klemen702	forgot his name
2016-04-19 18:51:24	@Espyo	yeah, rrabit42 or something
2016-04-19 18:51:32	@Espyo	he was likely sent by wikia, yes
2016-04-19 18:51:37	@Espyo	you can tell by looking at his profile page
2016-04-19 18:51:46	@Espyo	he's tagged as something dumb like "wikia superstar"
2016-04-19 18:51:53	@Espyo	so he's either sent, or a blind fanboy
2016-04-19 18:53:10	Yoshi3	smells like shills

2016-04-19 18:54:53	Klemen702	would someone like him be sent if a discord invite was writen on a wikia
2016-04-19 18:55:04	Klemen702	so it can be used instead of wikia chat
2016-04-19 18:55:11	@Espyo	not quite sure I follow
2016-04-19 18:55:34	Klemen702	there's this new hot program called discord

2016-04-19 18:56:24	Klemen702	well
2016-04-19 18:56:29	Klemen702	i was talking with someone
2016-04-19 18:56:36	Klemen702	if wikia would remove any discord invite
2016-04-19 18:56:39	Klemen702	that is show on a wikia
2016-04-19 18:56:42	Klemen702	shown*
2016-04-19 18:57:25	Klemen702	since wikia already has a (horrible) chat thing

2016-04-19 19:08:30	Yoshi3	UltraMario: this is a nokia 3310 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310

2016-04-19 19:08:54	Neocraftz1553	Klemen702: What if it sprouts Nokia 3310s?
2016-04-19 19:08:56	UltraMario	is that like an android
2016-04-19 19:09:05	Yoshi3	look at the wikipage
2016-04-19 19:09:06	Neocraftz1553	Nokia 3310?
2016-04-19 19:09:08	UltraMario	Klemen702: okay
2016-04-19 19:09:11	Yoshi3	does that look like a fucking android phone
2016-04-19 19:09:12	Testyo	Language...
2016-04-19 19:09:15	Neocraftz1553	Not at all
2016-04-19 19:09:26	Neocraftz1553	Its the legendary phone
2016-04-19 19:09:28	Klemen702	isn't android another word for robot
2016-04-19 19:09:32	Yoshi3	Neocraftz1553: yeah but UM has a tendency to not look at the links I provide
2016-04-19 19:09:32	Klemen702	phones aren't robots
2016-04-19 19:09:35	Klemen702	you fool
2016-04-19 19:09:58	UltraMario	no
2016-04-19 19:10:00	Neocraftz1553	The Nokia 3310 can be used as a weapon
2016-04-19 19:10:00	UltraMario	that's the brand
2016-04-19 19:10:18	Klemen702	what does the weapon do
2016-04-19 19:10:24	Neocraftz1553	It can also break through a glass floor if you're standing on it
2016-04-19 19:10:32	UltraMario	.
2016-04-19 19:10:34	Neocraftz1553	Just throw it at someones head
2016-04-19 19:10:37	UltraMario	goddammit neo
2016-04-19 19:10:40	Neocraftz1553	give 'em a concussion...
2016-04-19 19:10:40	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 19:10:44	Klemen702	neo
2016-04-19 19:10:47	Klemen702	want to learn something cool
2016-04-19 19:10:47	UltraMario	that phone isnt smart at all
2016-04-19 19:10:48	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-19 19:10:57	Klemen702	if you go ontop of your roof
2016-04-19 19:11:00	Neocraftz1553	The Nokia? Not at all
2016-04-19 19:11:00	Klemen702	and then jump down
2016-04-19 19:11:01	Klemen702	you right
2016-04-19 19:11:05	Klemen702	you die*
2016-04-19 19:11:21	Neocraftz1553	duh
2016-04-19 19:11:30	Neocraftz1553	well... not reallly
2016-04-19 19:11:30	Klemen702	i just learned that today
2016-04-19 19:11:38	Neocraftz1553	depends on how you land and stuff
2016-04-19 19:11:58	Klemen702	because the human feet can survive being dropped a few meters or so
2016-04-19 19:12:03	Neocraftz1553	try to land near the ball of your foot, not your ankle
2016-04-19 19:12:17	Neocraftz1553	if you land on your ankle, you could shatter your spine
2016-04-19 19:12:35	Neocraftz1553	You could also try this one rolling technique I've heard of, but...
2016-04-19 19:12:41	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure how to do it
2016-04-19 19:13:39	Neocraftz1553	Try to cover your head with your hands, arms, and fingers, because you could go unconscious, and you might bounce when you hit the ground
2016-04-19 19:13:51	Neocraftz1553	but you could keep consciousness
2016-04-19 19:14:24	Neocraftz1553	Try not to hit the ground with your head, or you will die, bleed inside your brain, etc.
2016-04-19 19:14:26	Yoshi3	how do I cover my head with my hands but not the fingers
2016-04-19 19:14:49	Neocraftz1553	Keep your palm straight :/
2016-04-19 19:14:59	Yoshi3	ok
2016-04-19 19:15:07	Neocraftz1553	but seriously, wrap your fingers behind your head
2016-04-19 19:15:18	Yoshi3	that makes sense
2016-04-19 19:16:12	Klemen702	neo
2016-04-19 19:16:17	Neocraftz1553	Most deaths from falls from high places are due to people hitting ground with head on the second bounce
2016-04-19 19:16:25	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-19 19:16:34	Klemen702	what if the ground is covered with spiky saws and knifes
2016-04-19 19:16:36	Klemen702	how do i survive
2016-04-19 19:17:18	Neocraftz1553	then don't jump, or maneuver your way from them when you are in the air
2016-04-19 19:17:42	Klemen702	shit
2016-04-19 19:17:44	Neocraftz1553	of course, you will only have 1-3 seconds of free fall if it is from a small roof...
2016-04-19 19:17:55	@Espyo	#Pikipedia, where you learn about fatal concussions
2016-04-19 19:18:01	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-19 19:18:14	Klemen702	it's for pikmin military training i promise
2016-04-19 19:18:19	@Espyo	lol
2016-04-19 19:18:22	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-19 19:18:35	@Espyo	the proper way to fall down a bottomless pit so you respawn
2016-04-19 19:18:42	Neocraftz1553	hahaha
2016-04-19 19:18:46	@Espyo	is to wrap your meaty spacesuit gloves around the back of your helmet
2016-04-19 19:19:00	Klemen702	actually
2016-04-19 19:19:04	Klemen702	here's a better idea
2016-04-19 19:19:11	Klemen702	get an actual astronaut helmet
2016-04-19 19:19:15	Klemen702	and not a fucking fish bowl
2016-04-19 19:19:23	@Espyo	those don't come cheap, though
2016-04-19 19:19:24	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-04-19 19:19:48	Klemen702	steal one then
2016-04-19 19:19:56	Neocraftz1553	The Hocotate Space Co. used goldfish bowls
2016-04-19 19:20:16	Neocraftz1553	Klemen702: The visors are usually coated thinly with gold
2016-04-19 19:20:26	UltraMario	Klemen702: lemme know if you get it working
2016-04-19 19:20:31	Neocraftz1553	to reduce glare, radiation, scratches, etc.
2016-04-19 19:20:40	Neocraftz1553	something like that
2016-04-19 19:20:43	Klemen702	did anyone of you actually look at the pikmin 3 metal suit Z
2016-04-19 19:20:46	Klemen702	it looks so cheap
2016-04-19 19:20:53	Klemen702	basically a piece of metal attached to the suit
2016-04-19 19:21:35	Neocraftz1553	ikr?!?!
2016-04-19 19:21:56	Neocraftz1553	They could've made it more insulting, though
2016-04-19 19:22:15	UltraMario	metal suit z?

2016-04-19 19:25:03	Marty2000	Did you know that the Toady Bloyster in the Shaded Garden (battle enemies) had 490 HP?
2016-04-19 19:25:27	Neocraftz1553	less or more?
2016-04-19 19:25:48	En_Passant	much, much less
2016-04-19 19:25:55	Neocraftz1553	hm..
2016-04-19 19:26:05	Neocraftz1553	probably nerfed for challenge mode
2016-04-19 19:26:24	Marty2000	But... the Toady Bloyster in Clockwork Chasm has 1500 HP
2016-04-19 19:27:04	Neocraftz1553	more or less than norm?
2016-04-19 19:27:14	Neocraftz1553	actually, whats the normal health
2016-04-19 19:27:22	Marty2000	It's 1500 in P3
2016-04-19 19:27:29	Neocraftz1553	ahh, ok
2016-04-19 19:27:57	Neocraftz1553	So, nerfed for challenge mode in shaded garden...
2016-04-19 19:28:10	Neocraftz1553	maybe because there isn't many water enemies in clockwork chasm?

2016-04-19 19:47:19	Bulborbs_At_View	Yeah, skeletons are a really good way of visualizing the pose you want to give to your character.
2016-04-19 19:47:43	Klemen702	yes but stick figures are less spooky
2016-04-19 19:48:11	Bulborbs_At_View	xD

2016-04-19 20:36:45	Nvortex	it loks good 
2016-04-19 20:36:55	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-04-19 20:37:06	ScruffyChat	Nice job selecting the colors, by the way
2016-04-19 20:37:12	ScruffyChat	Turned out really well
2016-04-19 20:37:48	Nvortex	i dont know how to explain it but, the tip (hand) of the tentacles was the one that i wanted to be the darker color but it looms as it is right now
2016-04-19 20:41:01	Nvortex	is there a way to make the tentacles looks as if they were behind the head? i dont know how to say it properly it but since its supposed to be hanging
2016-04-19 20:41:59	ScruffyChat	Lucky for both of us, I made those tentacles have an armature
2016-04-19 20:42:11	ScruffyChat	So I can stretch them anywhere I want
2016-04-19 20:42:37	ScruffyChat	And I see what you mean now, it puts its tentacles behind its head to hang on walls
2016-04-19 20:42:44	Nvortex	yes
2016-04-19 20:42:54	ScruffyChat	But the first comment: you want just the tentacle to be dark orange, and not the arms?
2016-04-19 20:43:11	Nvortex	yes not the arms just the...hand part
2016-04-19 20:43:31	ScruffyChat	Alright, easily fixed
2016-04-19 20:43:33	Nvortex	i think its the angle of the render but i like how it turns gradually darker
2016-04-19 20:43:53	Nvortex	how it looks that it turns*
2016-04-19 20:44:08	ScruffyChat	Oh actually I made that intentionally gradual
2016-04-19 20:44:33	Nvortex	it looks cool thanks for that detail (actually i wanted it to be like taht but i didnt know how to explain it until now)
2016-04-19 20:44:43	ScruffyChat	Heh, no problem
2016-04-19 20:44:55	ScruffyChat	So then I'll just move the arms and re-render, shouldn't take too long
2016-04-19 20:44:57	ScruffyChat	But
2016-04-19 20:45:08	ScruffyChat	Would you still like it on the ground? Or hanging from a wall?
2016-04-19 20:45:24	Nvortex	can you make it on a wall?
2016-04-19 20:45:30	ScruffyChat	Sure!
2016-04-19 20:45:37	Nvortex	ok please do it
2016-04-19 20:45:44	Nvortex	what kind of wall?
2016-04-19 20:46:11	ScruffyChat	I was just going to go for blank again, as though it's concept art
2016-04-19 20:46:22	ScruffyChat	But I'm all ears if you'd like an environment for it
2016-04-19 20:46:45	Nvortex	well this is like a cave creature so maybe a rocky wall
2016-04-19 20:46:50	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-04-19 20:46:54	ScruffyChat	And some low lighting
2016-04-19 20:46:58	ScruffyChat	But high-contrast
2016-04-19 20:47:14	ScruffyChat	I've tested it in low light and it looks good, a little creepy
2016-04-19 20:48:12	Nvortex	my idea was that iti can change colors to fit the way the wall looks like (like octopuses), their real color is that orange
2016-04-19 20:49:59	Nvortex	again, thank you so much for this, i really wanted to see this in 3d because at school, a friend of mine had the idea of a hanging enemy so we designed it
2016-04-19 20:52:05	ScruffyChat	Nice
2016-04-19 20:52:09	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-04-19 20:52:33	ScruffyChat	I'll render it in a cave environment, but it may take a while as this is high-sample
2016-04-19 20:53:25	Nvortex	i feel bad telling you how to do this...i never really liked telling people how to do stuff especially since you are making this because you wanted to 
2016-04-19 20:55:20	ScruffyChat	It's no trouble really, hopefully someday I'll make some Blender tutorials so you can learn to do it as well
2016-04-19 20:55:26	ScruffyChat	It's free and open-source
2016-04-19 20:55:48	Nvortex	oh cool

2016-04-19 21:03:12	Nvortex	for me to like pikmin fusions, i would only like them if they really make them work
2016-04-19 21:04:00	Marty2000	As said before, I would love to see Winged Mushroom Pikmin in-game
2016-04-19 21:04:13	UltraMario	Marty2000: do you have smash 4?
2016-04-19 21:04:14	UltraMario	curious

2016-04-19 21:04:50	UltraMario	wanna join my next tourney?
2016-04-19 21:04:50	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-19 21:04:59	UltraMario	it's not a serious one btqw
2016-04-19 21:05:01	UltraMario	*btw
2016-04-19 21:05:01	Klemen702	the question is how many could be fused at a tie
2016-04-19 21:05:03	Klemen702	time*
2016-04-19 21:05:05	UltraMario	i usually do themed tourney
2016-04-19 21:05:06	Marty2000	Why not, but it depends on when it is
2016-04-19 21:05:09	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 21:05:16	UltraMario	it's a tourney themed on melee
2016-04-19 21:05:21	UltraMario	so melee content only
2016-04-19 21:05:21	Klemen702	blues could be fused well with any pikmin basically
2016-04-19 21:05:25	Klemen702	since they are only used for water 
2016-04-19 21:05:32	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/16/1461096066-winged-mushroom-pikmin-2.png

2016-04-19 21:06:42	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-19 21:07:36	UltraMario	i usually like to do the start and end date relevant to  the thing the tourney is on
2016-04-19 21:07:39	UltraMario	so for example
2016-04-19 21:07:49	UltraMario	my mario tourney ended on september 13th
2016-04-19 21:07:54	UltraMario	the first release of smb1
2016-04-19 21:07:57	UltraMario	:)
2016-04-19 21:08:45	Nvortex	i want to see the puffstool as a cool boss
2016-04-19 21:08:59	UltraMario	btw
2016-04-19 21:09:06	Nvortex	it could have its own army of mushroom pikmin that have been infected for a long time and are beyond salvation
2016-04-19 21:09:12	UltraMario	i dont only include characters in the final game, either
2016-04-19 21:09:13	UltraMario	;)

2016-04-19 21:09:21	UltraMario	:D

2016-04-19 21:23:20	En_Passant	Hey Scruffy, what's the irregular time signature in Mystic March?
2016-04-19 21:23:26	UltraMario	btw
2016-04-19 21:23:37	UltraMario	the only problem i think this tourney would have
2016-04-19 21:23:37	UltraMario	is
2016-04-19 21:23:42	UltraMario	limited stage selection :V
2016-04-19 21:23:57	UltraMario	you'll need custom stages for the majority of melee's stage roster
2016-04-19 21:23:58	UltraMario	:S
2016-04-19 21:24:07	Marty2000	ok
2016-04-19 21:24:18	UltraMario	well i mean
2016-04-19 21:24:22	UltraMario	you dont need to make them
2016-04-19 21:24:23	UltraMario	but
2016-04-19 21:24:33	UltraMario	im just saying if not we have like 3 stages to choose from
2016-04-19 21:24:34	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:25:23	Marty2000	3 stages are ok for me, if I recall well I have Corneria in my custom stages
2016-04-19 21:25:31	UltraMario	nice
2016-04-19 21:25:38	UltraMario	did you make it?
2016-04-19 21:25:39	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-19 21:25:48	Marty2000	No I didn't
2016-04-19 21:25:55	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-19 21:25:57	Marty2000	It was sent by a friend
2016-04-19 21:26:00	UltraMario	i remember downloading one from online
2016-04-19 21:26:01	UltraMario	ah
2016-04-19 21:26:09	UltraMario	i had a remake of yoshi's story sent from a friend
2016-04-19 21:26:17	UltraMario	btw
2016-04-19 21:26:29	UltraMario	i have remade a lot of misc smash 64 stages
2016-04-19 21:26:30	UltraMario	:D
2016-04-19 21:26:39	UltraMario	wanna know what exactly i remade?
2016-04-19 21:26:56	Marty2000	The only stages I made were stages with very little platforms (and were made for my Kirby, Meta Knigh and DDD with 200+ speed)
2016-04-19 21:26:58	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-19 21:27:02	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 21:27:08	UltraMario	before i remake the actual stages
2016-04-19 21:27:17	UltraMario	i figured it'd be neat to recreate  the non 2player mode stages
2016-04-19 21:27:21	UltraMario	so
2016-04-19 21:27:40	UltraMario	lemme see what i have
2016-04-19 21:28:12	UltraMario	okay so
2016-04-19 21:28:33	UltraMario	i have one of the test stages remade, all of the break  the targets stages, and 11 of the board the platforms stages
2016-04-19 21:28:48	Marty2000	Cool
2016-04-19 21:28:54	UltraMario	yup
2016-04-19 21:29:03	UltraMario	those stages are pretty chaotic to fight on
2016-04-19 21:29:03	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:29:27	UltraMario	caves of life everywhere

2016-04-19 21:29:57	Marty2000	I love chaotic stages. I remember having parties in Friends Room with one CPu : everybody had 300%, with many explosives items, and many lives

2016-04-19 21:31:20	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:31:33	UltraMario	i like some chaotic stages
2016-04-19 21:31:38	UltraMario	like magicant
2016-04-19 21:31:42	UltraMario	or warioware inc
2016-04-19 21:31:45	UltraMario	but not all of them
2016-04-19 21:31:53	UltraMario	75m comes to mind
2016-04-19 21:31:54	Testyo	75 m = 82.02 yd / 246.06 ft / 3947.37 Olimar-heights
2016-04-19 21:31:54	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:32:04	UltraMario	wat
2016-04-19 21:32:48	UltraMario	also ill go remake jigglypuff's platforms stage nnow
2016-04-19 21:33:06	UltraMario	well

2016-04-19 21:43:27	Marty2000	Who has Splatoon here? Since new weapons were released some time ago, I'll probably play the game again. Are the new weapons good?
2016-04-19 21:43:31	UltraMario	i do
2016-04-19 21:43:36	UltraMario	havent played it in agestho
2016-04-19 21:43:37	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:43:44	UltraMario	also
2016-04-19 21:43:53	UltraMario	Marty2000: i think i have a start date now
2016-04-19 21:44:00	Marty2000	Good
2016-04-19 21:44:00	UltraMario	but ill need help thinking of the end date
2016-04-19 21:44:05	Marty2000	When is it?
2016-04-19 21:44:07	UltraMario	i think ill start it may 24th
2016-04-19 21:44:23	UltraMario	i usually have my tourneys around 1-3 months long
2016-04-19 21:44:31	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-19 21:44:45	UltraMario	that way even if there's tons of days we dont have matches, we still have plenty of days to catch up
2016-04-19 21:44:45	UltraMario	:D
2016-04-19 21:45:18	UltraMario	does that sound reasonable?
2016-04-19 21:45:25	Marty2000	May 24th is good for me. I'll note to remember it
2016-04-19 21:45:35	UltraMario	i mean for an end date
2016-04-19 21:45:35	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:45:40	UltraMario	i cant think of one cuz
2016-04-19 21:45:43	Marty2000	Ah
2016-04-19 21:45:44	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-19 21:45:47	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-19 21:46:00	UltraMario	i like to use dates that are relevant to the theme whenever i can
2016-04-19 21:46:10	UltraMario	but
2016-04-19 21:46:37	UltraMario	all the other melee release dates are too far away from 24th or too close
2016-04-19 21:46:39	UltraMario	:V
2016-04-19 21:46:55	UltraMario	so i cant decide my own end date :<
2016-04-19 21:48:17	Marty2000	1 month after it has started is a good ending date, maybe
2016-04-19 21:49:13	UltraMario	i dunno
2016-04-19 21:49:25	UltraMario	i like to strech them out as reasonably long as i can, really :P
2016-04-19 21:49:49	Marty2000	2 months?
2016-04-19 21:49:55	UltraMario	is july 24th good?
2016-04-19 21:50:05	Marty2000	For me it is
2016-04-19 21:50:11	UltraMario	nice
2016-04-19 21:50:29	UltraMario	by the way
2016-04-19 21:50:40	UltraMario	may 24th is the european release date of melee
2016-04-19 21:50:41	UltraMario	;)
2016-04-19 21:50:54	Marty2000	I could guess it :-)
2016-04-19 21:51:02	UltraMario	ah
2016-04-19 21:51:09	UltraMario	how'd you know? ;P
2016-04-19 21:51:30	Marty2000	I was nearly sure
2016-04-19 21:51:44	UltraMario	heh
2016-04-19 21:51:55	UltraMario	i always do my dates like that whenever possible
2016-04-19 21:51:55	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 21:52:27	UltraMario	because i think it's pretty neat doing it like that
2016-04-19 21:52:45	Marty2000	Yes it is ;)
2016-04-19 21:53:23	UltraMario	:>
2016-04-19 21:53:49	Marty2000	Well, I'm going to start Splatoon. I wanna see the new weapons (especially the Inkbrush)

2016-04-19 21:55:44	Marty2000	I used to play with all of them too, but I had favorites
2016-04-19 21:56:08	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 21:56:25	UltraMario	my favorites were the slosher weapons and the splatling weapons
2016-04-19 21:56:31	UltraMario	those were added in like the first update
2016-04-19 21:56:41	UltraMario	they're pretty fun to use for me
2016-04-19 21:56:43	Marty2000	The Splattershot Jr, Custom E-Liter 3K Scope, Zink Mini Splatling and Tri-Slosher were my favorites
2016-04-19 21:56:43	Testyo	3 K = -270.15 °C / -454.27 °F
2016-04-19 21:57:17	UltraMario	ah
2016-04-19 21:57:27	Marty2000	I have to admit I like weapons with Bubblers, I use them whenever some teammates are close to me
2016-04-19 21:57:31	UltraMario	so you played sinnce at least the first update
2016-04-19 21:58:00	Marty2000	I played it the day it came out

2016-04-19 21:58:57	Marty2000	Let's say... 7 or 8 hours per day
2016-04-19 21:59:32	Marty2000	At the beginning, due to the little lack of content, I wouldn't play it a lot, though
2016-04-19 22:01:11	Marty2000	a day*
2016-04-19 22:02:53	UltraMario	well, i didnt play it for that long, but

2016-04-19 22:30:31	Marty2000	I marked your levels. I'm going to see what I can give you
2016-04-19 22:31:31	Marty2000	But to be honest, my stages aren't great, they're like what you can find. I think I have two levels you might want to try
2016-04-19 22:32:14	En_Passant	Is it okay if I share mine?

2016-04-19 22:53:41	UltraMario	other people can help tag if it's not disabled

2016-04-19 22:56:12	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-19 22:56:42	Nvortex	i haven't felt like playing it for a long time
2016-04-19 22:56:50	Nvortex	it's the same pattern in every level
2016-04-19 22:56:59	Nvortex	pattern as in how to beat it
2016-04-19 22:56:59	UltraMario	what do you mean
2016-04-19 22:57:00	UltraMario	:|
2016-04-19 22:57:18	UltraMario	but
2016-04-19 22:57:23	Nvortex	it's always the same
2016-04-19 22:57:25	UltraMario	that's how literally ever 2d mario plays
2016-04-19 22:57:26	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 22:57:37	UltraMario	point a to point b
2016-04-19 22:57:43	Nvortex	you cant rush a 2d mario game without playing it atleast one
2016-04-19 22:57:57	Marty2000	P-Switch Block Maze was a cool level! I haven't tested many levels of this genre.
2016-04-19 22:58:02	UltraMario	thanks
2016-04-19 22:58:04	Nvortex	i can either complete in a single run a level or completely skip it because of the "difficulty"
2016-04-19 22:58:12	UltraMario	wait
2016-04-19 22:58:15	UltraMario	did you only play
2016-04-19 22:58:18	UltraMario	the sample levels
2016-04-19 22:58:18	UltraMario	:|
2016-04-19 22:58:41	UltraMario	also i thought of it when i remembered p switches dont affect blocks with things in them
2016-04-19 22:58:41	Nvortex	i didnt
2016-04-19 22:58:46	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-19 22:58:50	UltraMario	what did you play
2016-04-19 22:58:53	UltraMario	was it 100 mario
2016-04-19 22:59:00	Nvortex	yes, random levels
2016-04-19 22:59:01	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 22:59:03	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-19 22:59:05	UltraMario	no wonder
2016-04-19 22:59:05	Nvortex	they are basically the same
2016-04-19 22:59:08	UltraMario	100 mario is shit
2016-04-19 22:59:08	Testyo	Hey, don't swear!
2016-04-19 22:59:37	UltraMario	if you want actual levels, go on dedicated levels like the mario maker subreddit, or check the bookmark site's recommended section
2016-04-19 22:59:42	Marty2000	Testyo define Testyo 
2016-04-19 22:59:42	Testyo	I don't know what Testyo means!
2016-04-19 22:59:44	UltraMario	you're guaranteed to find something good
2016-04-19 22:59:48	Nvortex	i will do that later then
2016-04-19 22:59:54	UltraMario	:D
2016-04-19 23:00:01	UltraMario	playing luigi's physics
2016-04-19 23:00:02	UltraMario	heh
2016-04-19 23:00:07	UltraMario	red luigi
2016-04-19 23:00:21	UltraMario	uh
2016-04-19 23:01:00	UltraMario	you should put a door near the part with the paratroopas
2016-04-19 23:01:03	Marty2000	Finished your second level! Great idea!
2016-04-19 23:01:14	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-19 23:01:21	UltraMario	you can get stuck if you hit all of them and you have to backtrack to the first door
2016-04-19 23:01:22	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-19 23:01:30	UltraMario	also thanks
2016-04-19 23:01:43	UltraMario	ive had an idea block for awhile :x
2016-04-19 23:01:45	Marty2000	I wanted to make this level quite easy with doors
2016-04-19 23:02:02	UltraMario	how many are in the course, anyway
2016-04-19 23:02:08	Marty2000	So people wouldn't retry over and over if there were a problem
2016-04-19 23:02:18	UltraMario	?
2016-04-19 23:02:31	Marty2000	I don't remember
2016-04-19 23:02:34	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-19 23:02:40	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-04-19 23:03:08	UltraMario	well could you add one near the paratroopa part so it's less tedious? you have to backtrack to the pit and then run back to that section
2016-04-19 23:03:09	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 23:04:00	Marty2000	At the start of the level?
2016-04-19 23:04:09	UltraMario	well near the koopas
2016-04-19 23:04:16	UltraMario	there's already a door at the start
2016-04-19 23:04:31	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 23:05:04	UltraMario	yay infinite 1-up goombas
2016-04-19 23:05:19	UltraMario	also
2016-04-19 23:05:31	Marty2000	If you use the door in the pit, I think you can have Paratroopas again. This level is a sort of tutorial but I can still remove the pit if it's not good
2016-04-19 23:05:39	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 23:05:43	UltraMario	i just meant that
2016-04-19 23:05:56	UltraMario	it's a bit annoying having to backtrack, but maybe im just lazy
2016-04-19 23:05:56	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-19 23:06:03	UltraMario	also
2016-04-19 23:06:24	UltraMario	the section with the trembling lifts is a little discombobulating because of how mario maker's vertical camera works, but idk if there's anything you can do about that
2016-04-19 23:06:53	UltraMario	could also maybe use a checkpoint
2016-04-19 23:06:54	UltraMario	:V
2016-04-19 23:07:18	Marty2000	Yes I should, I made this level before checkpoints appear
2016-04-19 23:07:21	UltraMario	ah
2016-04-19 23:07:30	UltraMario	you could always 2.0
2016-04-19 23:08:45	UltraMario	also, minor aesthetic nitpick: there's a skeleton thing behind the pipe at the beginning  of the sub world
2016-04-19 23:08:45	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-19 23:09:18	UltraMario	ooo
2016-04-19 23:09:21	UltraMario	yay stiletto
2016-04-19 23:09:26	UltraMario	i love stilettos
2016-04-19 23:10:01	Marty2000	:-)
2016-04-19 23:10:12	UltraMario	i like weird mario's pose in the stiletto :P
2016-04-19 23:10:43	UltraMario	what's with the 2 coins after the flagpole?
2016-04-19 23:10:54	Marty2000	There's a secret path
2016-04-19 23:10:59	UltraMario	ooooooo
2016-04-19 23:11:11	 *	UltraMario replays in the editor :P
2016-04-19 23:12:57	UltraMario	oh, uh
2016-04-19 23:13:11	UltraMario	you forgot to put a pipe at the part with the parbones
2016-04-19 23:13:14	UltraMario	:V

2016-04-19 23:13:57	UltraMario	hm?
2016-04-19 23:14:38	UltraMario	i meant like
2016-04-19 23:14:45	UltraMario	a weird mushroom dispensing  pipe
2016-04-19 23:15:59	Marty2000	If you're talking about this part with the parabones, then ther's a door http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/16/1461104134-mm.jpg
2016-04-19 23:16:06	UltraMario	oh wait
2016-04-19 23:16:17	UltraMario	well i mean
2016-04-19 23:16:17	Marty2000	But if you are "Luigified", you don't even need them here
2016-04-19 23:16:31	UltraMario	but dont you need them for the upcoming part?
2016-04-19 23:16:49	Marty2000	Thanks to the pipe, you can jump 
2016-04-19 23:16:53	UltraMario	oh okay
2016-04-19 23:16:54	UltraMario	nice
2016-04-19 23:17:17	UltraMario	nice little stage :D
2016-04-19 23:17:27	UltraMario	wish there were more stages using  the weird mushroom :V
2016-04-19 23:17:29	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-04-19 23:17:45	UltraMario	now on solve it
2016-04-19 23:17:45	Marty2000	I have another stage using it
2016-04-19 23:18:07	UltraMario	nice
2016-04-19 23:18:09	Marty2000	Solve it can be easy for those who know what to do
2016-04-19 23:18:20	UltraMario	.
2016-04-19 23:18:20	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-19 23:18:27	 *	UltraMario backtracks
2016-04-19 23:18:31	Marty2000	Otherwise it was a nightmare for some at the beginning... but the stage is easy and short 
2016-04-19 23:18:37	UltraMario	didnt realize id need that :P
2016-04-19 23:18:41	 *	UltraMario feels silly
2016-04-19 23:18:54	UltraMario	was pretty easy
2016-04-19 23:19:06	UltraMario	the other  one i mean
2016-04-19 23:19:09	UltraMario	but fun
2016-04-19 23:19:15	Marty2000	18/283 attempts were successful here
2016-04-19 23:19:22	UltraMario	.

2016-04-19 23:19:44	UltraMario	im too scrubby for advanced techniques :P
2016-04-19 23:20:16	UltraMario	can i play it in the editor? :P
2016-04-19 23:20:19	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-19 23:20:28	Marty2000	Why wouldn't you be able to?
2016-04-19 23:20:28	UltraMario	yay
2016-04-19 23:20:36	UltraMario	true
2016-04-19 23:20:47	UltraMario	just wondering if you were okay with that
2016-04-19 23:21:04	Marty2000	Yes sure 
2016-04-19 23:22:34	UltraMario	not good with the advanced tech :p
2016-04-19 23:24:40	UltraMario	the end was kinda silly LP
2016-04-19 23:24:42	UltraMario	*:P
2016-04-19 23:25:10	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-04-19 23:25:25	Marty2000	Thanks for playing anyway!
2016-04-19 23:25:48	UltraMario	the bull's-eye bill section is kinda hard to get because of how things spawn in smm :v
2016-04-19 23:26:17	UltraMario	i'd recommend a door there because
2016-04-19 23:26:29	UltraMario	if you appear from  that screen
2016-04-19 23:26:38	UltraMario	all the bills fire at once
2016-04-19 23:26:50	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-19 23:27:08	UltraMario	that'll make it easier
2016-04-19 23:27:17	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-19 23:27:22	UltraMario	and an aesthetic thing:
2016-04-19 23:27:37	UltraMario	the big wall at the beginning has a few holes not covered :p
2016-04-19 23:28:08	Marty2000	I think you can't see them in normal gameplay, though
2016-04-19 23:28:11	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 23:28:18	UltraMario	you cant actually see the open holes
2016-04-19 23:28:25	UltraMario	but
2016-04-19 23:28:32	UltraMario	you can see the ground ends there
2016-04-19 23:28:45	UltraMario	like the top of it
2016-04-19 23:29:09	UltraMario	just a minor  thing but just felt like pointing it out
2016-04-19 23:29:09	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-19 23:29:23	Marty2000	Thanks for telling me anyway
2016-04-19 23:29:41	UltraMario	np
2016-04-19 23:29:47	UltraMario	that was fun
2016-04-19 23:29:56	Marty2000	Glad you liked then :-)
2016-04-19 23:29:59	UltraMario	we should exchange some other time :o
2016-04-19 23:30:07	UltraMario	i like exchanges
2016-04-19 23:30:24	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-19 23:31:18	UltraMario	:>
2016-04-19 23:31:37	UltraMario	wish i had more ideas though :(
2016-04-19 23:31:44	UltraMario	most of my levels are just remakes
2016-04-19 23:32:14	Marty2000	Oh, don't worry, I have two remakes two
2016-04-19 23:32:30	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 23:32:32	UltraMario	i mean
2016-04-19 23:32:51	UltraMario	at least my remakes are original in the fact that barely anyone else has remade them
2016-04-19 23:33:01	UltraMario	i like to remake obscure mario levels
2016-04-19 23:33:25	Marty2000	I'll try them later, I'd like to see them
2016-04-19 23:33:46	UltraMario	thnx
2016-04-19 23:33:55	UltraMario	ive remade one entire game so far :D
2016-04-19 23:34:00	UltraMario	and half of a game
2016-04-19 23:34:10	UltraMario	ill get to the other half when i can
2016-04-19 23:35:45	Marty2000	Testyo help

2016-04-19 23:58:14	UltraMario	yes
2016-04-19 23:58:15	UltraMario	silly

2016-04-19 23:58:37	@PikFan	yes, but I don't feel like doing time zone conversions
2016-04-19 23:58:47	UltraMario	o
2016-04-19 23:58:49	UltraMario	well
2016-04-19 23:58:51	UltraMario	like 40 minutes

2016-04-19 23:58:57	@PikFan	ah, okay
2016-04-19 23:59:11	@PikFan	now that I can understand
2016-04-20 00:01:45	@PikFan	huh, I wonder why he's leaving earlier though...

2016-04-20 00:02:05	@PikFan	you were here while he was watching that video, right?
2016-04-20 00:02:10	@PikFan	what was his reaction?
2016-04-20 00:07:33	UltraMario	what video
2016-04-20 00:07:45	@PikFan	you know, the 4chan raid
2016-04-20 00:07:52	@PikFan	the one Neo was talking about
2016-04-20 00:08:00	@PikFan	the one you said was a new level of stupid
2016-04-20 00:12:58	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-20 00:13:01	UltraMario	the log is gone
2016-04-20 00:13:02	UltraMario	:(

2016-04-20 00:21:05	Nvortex	i'm trying to get you into an awesome shoe
2016-04-20 00:21:05	Nvortex	maybe it will serve as inspiration i don't know
2016-04-20 00:21:22	@PikFan	INSPIRATION?!?!??!
2016-04-20 00:21:30	@PikFan	what is this inspiration
2016-04-20 00:21:33	Nvortex	you write stuff right?
2016-04-20 00:21:39	@PikFan	yeah
2016-04-20 00:21:47	Nvortex	this will give you the feelz
2016-04-20 00:21:51	@PikFan	inspiration for writing
2016-04-20 00:22:00	Nvortex	yeah
2016-04-20 00:22:16	@PikFan	like, I've got the story planned out all the way to Chapter 15-ish

2016-04-20 00:27:19	@PikFan	by the way, Nvortex
2016-04-20 00:27:27	@PikFan	how do you feel about the story, overall?
2016-04-20 00:27:58	Nvortex	brb /might/ return in an hour and a half
2016-04-20 00:28:16	@PikFan	wait answer my question first
2016-04-20 00:28:44	Nvortex	i need to read more to have a complete opinion
2016-04-20 00:28:58	@PikFan	oh, I thought you already read all of it
2016-04-20 00:29:01	@PikFan	nvm
2016-04-20 00:29:04	@PikFan	well, see ya
2016-04-20 00:29:07	Nvortex	i meant like MORE chapters
2016-04-20 00:29:17	@PikFan	oh
2016-04-20 00:29:30	@PikFan	I meant on what I have so far but alright
2016-04-20 00:29:37	Nvortex	but as of now, i don't know what to think of enemies with...special abilities?
2016-04-20 00:29:48	Nvortex	like snagrets curing themselves
2016-04-20 00:30:25	Nvortex	i like the setting by the way
2016-04-20 00:30:35	Nvortex	adventures and stuff
2016-04-20 00:30:45	Nvortex	now brb for real
2016-04-20 00:31:03	@PikFan	yeah, I can see your concern in their healing, I should do something about that
2016-04-20 00:31:08	@PikFan	oh, and thanks
2016-04-20 00:31:10	ScruffyChat	Not sure if an hour and a half fits within "be right back"
2016-04-20 00:31:17	ScruffyChat	That'd be bwb, be way back
2016-04-20 00:31:26	@PikFan	or bbl, be back later
2016-04-20 00:33:59	ScruffyChat	Right now I'm creating and rendering a scene in Blender
2016-04-20 00:34:11	ScruffyChat	It'll be a "screenshot" of Sandbox mode in Pikmin Forever
2016-04-20 00:34:16	ScruffyChat	So that I can create the article forr it
2016-04-20 00:34:18	@PikFan	ooh, neat!
2016-04-20 00:35:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2016-04-20 00:35:44	ScruffyChat	Essentially it's Super Pikmin Maker
2016-04-20 00:35:50	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as slepi
2016-04-20 00:36:10	@PikFan	by the way, do you ever intend on making a "screenshot" of your game, complete with HUD and all?
2016-04-20 00:36:19	ScruffyChat	That's what this will be
2016-04-20 00:36:34	ScruffyChat	But sure, of the story mode eventually
2016-04-20 00:36:46	@PikFan	story mode, yeah, that's what I meant
2016-04-20 00:37:33	ScruffyChat	It's just tricky because few of my models have armatures, so posing them is a chore
2016-04-20 00:37:43	ScruffyChat	And those are the longest renders
2016-04-20 00:37:50	@PikFan	hmmm
2016-04-20 00:39:25	ScruffyChat	Even this one has taken 3 hours so far, and it's 65% done
2016-04-20 00:39:55	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-20 00:40:03	@PikFan	that's a long time for your renders, right?
2016-04-20 00:40:33	ScruffyChat	Heh, yes
2016-04-20 00:40:43	ScruffyChat	Well that's really only because this one has water in it, and for once I wanted to render some caustics
2016-04-20 00:40:51	@PikFan	oh
2016-04-20 00:40:56	ScruffyChat	so I set it to 4096 samples
2016-04-20 00:41:09	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-20 00:41:38	ScruffyChat	Caustics haven't really rendered (mainly because there's little space between the water and the ground) but it still looks good
2016-04-20 00:42:45	ScruffyChat	In this scene the player has a Red Bulborb queued and is figuring out where to place it
2016-04-20 00:43:57	@PikFan	mmm
2016-04-20 00:46:50	ScruffyChat	Ever since I played Pikmin 2, I wanted the option to build Pikmin stages
2016-04-20 00:46:57	ScruffyChat	I guess that's why I'm so intrigued by hacking the game
2016-04-20 00:48:04	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-20 01:03:16	UltraMario	ever since i played mario
2016-04-20 01:03:21	UltraMario	er
2016-04-20 01:03:21	UltraMario	lbp
2016-04-20 01:03:33	UltraMario	iw wanted the option to build mario stages
2016-04-20 01:03:33	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:03:33	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2016-04-20 01:03:35	UltraMario	*i
2016-04-20 01:03:45	UltraMario	well, easily
2016-04-20 01:03:55	@PikFan	you know, it's funny
2016-04-20 01:03:56	UltraMario	all these online editors dont cut it for me
2016-04-20 01:03:56	UltraMario	:V
2016-04-20 01:03:58	@PikFan	and sad at the same time
2016-04-20 01:04:08	@PikFan	I've always wanted to make my own Mario levels
2016-04-20 01:04:14	@PikFan	and then I got Super Mario Maker
2016-04-20 01:04:21	@PikFan	but I've barely touched it...
2016-04-20 01:04:34	@PikFan	I dunno why
2016-04-20 01:10:54	UltraMario	PikFan: wow
2016-04-20 01:10:55	UltraMario	you should
2016-04-20 01:11:06	UltraMario	it's way easier to get into than any online mario editor
2016-04-20 01:11:09	UltraMario	it's so easy to use
2016-04-20 01:11:10	UltraMario	:D
2016-04-20 01:13:19	ScruffyChat	I wonder if they drew any inspiration from online mario editors
2016-04-20 01:13:58	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:14:12	UltraMario	i mean, it's not unlikely, but i dunno
2016-04-20 01:14:22	UltraMario	they dont really acknowledge fan stuff a lot
2016-04-20 01:14:43	@PikFan	that's one of the things that I don't like about Nintendo:
2016-04-20 01:14:50	@PikFan	they don't communicate with their fans
2016-04-20 01:15:06	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:15:10	UltraMario	they're a big company
2016-04-20 01:15:12	@PikFan	they think they're so entitled to their own opinions and decisions
2016-04-20 01:15:16	@PikFan	and to be fair, yes, they are
2016-04-20 01:15:22	UltraMario	do you expect them to respond to every single person
2016-04-20 01:15:23	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:15:27	@PikFan	but it doesn't hurt to have community input
2016-04-20 01:15:32	@PikFan	no, not every single person
2016-04-20 01:15:37	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:15:41	UltraMario	it's hard to manage
2016-04-20 01:15:42	UltraMario	i mean
2016-04-20 01:15:43	@PikFan	but just acknowledge them
2016-04-20 01:15:46	UltraMario	at least they have like
2016-04-20 01:15:49	UltraMario	good customer support
2016-04-20 01:16:06	@PikFan	I've never had to use their customer support, so I wouldn't know
2016-04-20 01:16:23	UltraMario	so far theyve been pretty good
2016-04-20 01:16:27	@PikFan	but Microsoft seems to communicate better with their fans than Nintendo
2016-04-20 01:16:29	UltraMario	in my experience
2016-04-20 01:16:35	@PikFan	and Microsoft is way bigger than Nintendo
2016-04-20 01:16:47	UltraMario	also pikfan why dont you like stuff like club nintendo anyway
2016-04-20 01:16:48	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:17:00	@PikFan	I never said I don't like it
2016-04-20 01:17:04	@PikFan	I just don't see the point
2016-04-20 01:17:08	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-20 01:17:10	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:17:11	@PikFan	it's just an extra thing I have to do
2016-04-20 01:17:15	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:17:19	UltraMario	oh i said that
2016-04-20 01:17:20	@PikFan	by the way, you say "well" a lot :P
2016-04-20 01:17:23	UltraMario	yes

2016-04-20 01:17:59	UltraMario	for being loyal

2016-04-20 01:18:07	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:18:11	@PikFan	but I just don't feel like doing it
2016-04-20 01:18:12	UltraMario	what's not to love?
2016-04-20 01:18:13	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:18:16	ScruffyChat	Wells... they're a deep subject
2016-04-20 01:18:23	UltraMario	cant argue with free things
2016-04-20 01:18:29	UltraMario	also
2016-04-20 01:18:30	@PikFan	heh yeah, Scruffy
2016-04-20 01:18:38	UltraMario	the new program isnt as tedious as cn
2016-04-20 01:18:43	UltraMario	if that's what your wondering
2016-04-20 01:18:48	UltraMario	so far there's no surveys
2016-04-20 01:18:49	@PikFan	eh
2016-04-20 01:18:52	UltraMario	or anything like that
2016-04-20 01:18:58	UltraMario	oh come on :P
2016-04-20 01:19:11	UltraMario	it takes like 5 seconds to make an account
2016-04-20 01:19:15	@PikFan	you're a lot more passionate about Nintendo than I ever will be
2016-04-20 01:19:20	UltraMario	true :>
2016-04-20 01:19:26	 *	UltraMario is a fanboy
2016-04-20 01:19:26	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:19:47	UltraMario	you also get points just for logging into miiverse weekly
2016-04-20 01:19:48	ScruffyChat	I'm glad they eliminated surveys, although it did get me excited whenever I got a game to think it would earn me Coins
2016-04-20 01:19:50	UltraMario	eshop too
2016-04-20 01:19:55	ScruffyChat	Really
2016-04-20 01:19:57	ScruffyChat	Neat!
2016-04-20 01:20:00	@PikFan	but anyway, about the communication thing
2016-04-20 01:20:22	@PikFan	Nintendo has IGNORED the fans for Mother 3 to come out in NA, or something like that
2016-04-20 01:20:28	UltraMario	no
2016-04-20 01:20:38	@PikFan	I dunno much about it, but the fans were upset and Nintendo didn't listen
2016-04-20 01:20:43	UltraMario	mother is a niche franchise
2016-04-20 01:20:45	@PikFan	and I don't like that
2016-04-20 01:20:49	UltraMario	they wont ever release it
2016-04-20 01:20:53	UltraMario	same with f-zero
2016-04-20 01:20:56	UltraMario	it wont get another game
2016-04-20 01:20:57	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-20 01:21:03	UltraMario	probably
2016-04-20 01:21:07	@PikFan	don't defend Nintendo's decision
2016-04-20 01:21:14	@PikFan	you know it's a bad decision
2016-04-20 01:21:18	UltraMario	i mean
2016-04-20 01:21:24	UltraMario	im not saying i like it
2016-04-20 01:21:26	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:21:35	@PikFan	Pikmin is a niche series too
2016-04-20 01:21:39	UltraMario	but
2016-04-20 01:21:47	UltraMario	hm
2016-04-20 01:21:48	@PikFan	not as niche as Mother and F-Zero, but still a niche
2016-04-20 01:21:52	UltraMario	i think it's more suc-
2016-04-20 01:21:54	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-20 01:22:08	UltraMario	that's still a thing because miyamoto :P
2016-04-20 01:22:13	@PikFan	only after 9 years did they finally—yeah
2016-04-20 01:22:14	UltraMario	probably
2016-04-20 01:22:27	UltraMario	he cares about his franchises
2016-04-20 01:22:30	@PikFan	but here's the thing
2016-04-20 01:22:32	UltraMario	f-zero and metroid arent
2016-04-20 01:22:33	UltraMario	i think
2016-04-20 01:22:40	@PikFan	last year's E3
2016-04-20 01:22:46	UltraMario	i didnt mind it
2016-04-20 01:22:47	UltraMario	:V
2016-04-20 01:22:59	 *	UltraMario was one of the few :P
2016-04-20 01:23:06	@PikFan	Reggie says, "Oh we had good Zelda footage, but we didn't want to disappoint the fans."
2016-04-20 01:23:13	UltraMario	wait
2016-04-20 01:23:15	UltraMario	did he really
2016-04-20 01:23:16	UltraMario	source?
2016-04-20 01:23:17	@PikFan	what in the—?!?!?
2016-04-20 01:23:20	@PikFan	like
2016-04-20 01:23:24	@PikFan	what is the logic behind that
2016-04-20 01:23:27	@PikFan	there is none
2016-04-20 01:23:33	UltraMario	source pls :P
2016-04-20 01:24:08	 *	UltraMario is a skeptic :p
2016-04-20 01:24:21	UltraMario	i just like things verified before i can believe for sure
2016-04-20 01:24:22	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-20 01:24:47	UltraMario	im like an article on a wiki i guess :P
2016-04-20 01:24:52	UltraMario	[citation needed]
2016-04-20 01:25:01	ScruffyChat	how does Scruffy refer to himself in 3rd person again?
2016-04-20 01:25:08	@PikFan	"We could have scored a lot of points and showed some little tidbit of Zelda Wii U, but in our collective opinion the belief was, in the end, that would cause more frustration than benefit." http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/18/e3-2015-why-nintendo-didnt-show-zelda-wii-u
2016-04-20 01:25:10	UltraMario	like that
2016-04-20 01:25:28	@PikFan	in other words, they did have things to show, but chose not do
2016-04-20 01:25:32	UltraMario	but
2016-04-20 01:25:35	@PikFan	because they think that doing so would be bad
2016-04-20 01:25:35	UltraMario	maybe it was like
2016-04-20 01:25:40	@PikFan	but how in the hell would it be bad
2016-04-20 01:25:42	UltraMario	not good enough to be shown
2016-04-20 01:25:42	UltraMario	like
2016-04-20 01:25:44	UltraMario	incomplete
2016-04-20 01:25:51	@PikFan	...
2016-04-20 01:25:54	UltraMario	maybe they didnt complete the thing in time
2016-04-20 01:25:56	@PikFan	incomplete?
2016-04-20 01:25:58	UltraMario	the demo i mean
2016-04-20 01:26:00	@PikFan	incomplete?
2016-04-20 01:26:02	UltraMario	yes
2016-04-20 01:26:03	@PikFan	incomplete?
2016-04-20 01:26:11	@PikFan	uh
2016-04-20 01:26:16	UltraMario	complete enough to present
2016-04-20 01:26:18	UltraMario	i mean
2016-04-20 01:26:18	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:26:21	@PikFan	they had footage for E3 2014
2016-04-20 01:26:24	@PikFan	and Game Awards
2016-04-20 01:26:31	UltraMario	o
2016-04-20 01:26:40	@PikFan	you can't tell me that they didn't have something that wasn't complete
2016-04-20 01:26:42	UltraMario	wasnt the 2014 footage just a trailer
2016-04-20 01:26:49	@PikFan	kinda sorta
2016-04-20 01:27:02	UltraMario	well idk if that counts since it's not gameplay
2016-04-20 01:27:18	ScruffyChat	He also stated Zelda Wii U wasn't a 2015 project, and Nintendo likes to use E3 to announce games coming out in the holiday season, not works in progress
2016-04-20 01:27:24	UltraMario	maybe the thing is
2016-04-20 01:27:35	@PikFan	yeah, I don't like that logic either
2016-04-20 01:27:35	UltraMario	they took a break with zelda u to work on tri force heroes
2016-04-20 01:27:38	@PikFan	@Scruffy
2016-04-20 01:27:39	UltraMario	or something
2016-04-20 01:28:05	@PikFan	they just keep their long term projects in the dark nowadays
2016-04-20 01:28:07	@PikFan	it's sad...
2016-04-20 01:28:11	UltraMario	also i mean i can understand that logic
2016-04-20 01:28:22	UltraMario	dont exactly agree
2016-04-20 01:28:24	UltraMario	but w/e
2016-04-20 01:28:25	UltraMario	i mean
2016-04-20 01:28:33	UltraMario	they sometimes show stuff from a game we know already
2016-04-20 01:28:35	UltraMario	like smm
2016-04-20 01:28:37	UltraMario	and yww
2016-04-20 01:28:46	@PikFan	I understand it too, they don't want the hype to die
2016-04-20 01:28:51	UltraMario	and others i cant think of
2016-04-20 01:28:56	@PikFan	but at the same time, not showing anything hurts the hype even more
2016-04-20 01:29:02	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:29:06	@PikFan	speculation is bad for everyone
2016-04-20 01:29:07	UltraMario	maybe it'd  be good if
2016-04-20 01:29:08	UltraMario	like
2016-04-20 01:29:12	UltraMario	they did it sakurai style
2016-04-20 01:29:20	UltraMario	and did a pic of the day
2016-04-20 01:29:22	UltraMario	and stuff
2016-04-20 01:29:22	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-20 01:29:29	@PikFan	I'd like that, yeah
2016-04-20 01:29:42	@PikFan	kinda like the pictures from Pluto
2016-04-20 01:29:47	UltraMario	sakurai is pretty good at hyping his games, imo
2016-04-20 01:29:50	@PikFan	people slowly piece everything together
2016-04-20 01:30:04	@PikFan	but there's still a lot to be learned
2016-04-20 01:30:07	UltraMario	with brawl and melee he constantly showed updates
2016-04-20 01:30:09	UltraMario	er
2016-04-20 01:30:11	UltraMario	*smash 4
2016-04-20 01:30:28	UltraMario	and kept the fans enlightened
2016-04-20 01:31:06	UltraMario	that reminds me
2016-04-20 01:31:28	UltraMario	they're not very good with telling us stuff that changed in patches as well
2016-04-20 01:31:29	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:31:41	UltraMario	the only time theyve good with that afaik is splatoon
2016-04-20 01:31:49	UltraMario	where they actually talk about changes
2016-04-20 01:32:19	@PikFan	yeah, with their Splatoon tumblr
2016-04-20 01:32:27	UltraMario	and on the splatoon website
2016-04-20 01:32:40	@PikFan	not even that, but I love that they reshare fanart
2016-04-20 01:32:44	UltraMario	they do actual patch notes
2016-04-20 01:32:48	UltraMario	instead of just
2016-04-20 01:32:51	@PikFan	and throw in jokes and stuff
2016-04-20 01:32:53	UltraMario	"something something stability"
2016-04-20 01:32:55	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:33:14	@PikFan	they even quoted Doctor Who one time
2016-04-20 01:33:59	UltraMario	btw
2016-04-20 01:34:02	UltraMario	off-topic, but
2016-04-20 01:34:13	UltraMario	smash 4 has the best trophy descriptions in the series
2016-04-20 01:34:14	UltraMario	imo
2016-04-20 01:34:20	@PikFan	lol
2016-04-20 01:34:29	UltraMario	they took it up a notch with the humor
2016-04-20 01:34:29	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:34:30	ScruffyChat	They're always getting better
2016-04-20 01:34:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-20 01:34:44	UltraMario	iirc they got the earthbound writing team
2016-04-20 01:34:46	UltraMario	i think
2016-04-20 01:34:51	ScruffyChat	I'm not satisfied until every trophy description ends with a pun
2016-04-20 01:34:54	UltraMario	heh
2016-04-20 01:35:01	ScruffyChat	or a joke of some form
2016-04-20 01:35:05	UltraMario	you'd like the inkling trophy i bet ;)
2016-04-20 01:35:15	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-04-20 01:35:58	UltraMario	i like when it's informative and has puns
2016-04-20 01:36:01	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:36:09	ScruffyChat	Oh, the scene is done, now to add the HUD
2016-04-20 01:36:26	@PikFan	yay
2016-04-20 01:36:37	ScruffyChat	ah, there are too many error
2016-04-20 01:36:38	ScruffyChat	s
2016-04-20 01:36:50	ScruffyChat	I can't just accept this
2016-04-20 01:37:07	ScruffyChat	4.5 hours though it may have been
2016-04-20 01:37:29	@PikFan	?
2016-04-20 01:37:32	@PikFan	it crashed?
2016-04-20 01:37:52	UltraMario	hey scruffy
2016-04-20 01:37:54	UltraMario	question
2016-04-20 01:37:58	UltraMario	do you have a smartphone?
2016-04-20 01:38:02	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-04-20 01:38:07	ScruffyChat	and it didn't crash
2016-04-20 01:38:13	ScruffyChat	I just don't like the look of the water
2016-04-20 01:38:15	@PikFan	oh, he wants you to get miitomo
2016-04-20 01:38:18	ScruffyChat	but I'll play with it
2016-04-20 01:38:31	@PikFan	huh, what happened with the water?
2016-04-20 01:38:47	ScruffyChat	Well it takes Cycles a lot of work to calculate refraction
2016-04-20 01:38:57	@PikFan	right
2016-04-20 01:39:06	ScruffyChat	And I got it to work
2016-04-20 01:39:15	ScruffyChat	But in the process the look of the water wasn't as great
2016-04-20 01:39:19	ScruffyChat	I'm in the Pixar moment
2016-04-20 01:39:33	ScruffyChat	It looks realistic, but not how we want it to look
2016-04-20 01:39:38	ScruffyChat	So bend the rules
2016-04-20 01:40:04	@PikFan	so, will it be a quick fix or a long fix?
2016-04-20 01:40:47	ScruffyChat	Might be a long fix
2016-04-20 01:40:51	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately
2016-04-20 01:40:59	ScruffyChat	But in the name of design!!!
2016-04-20 01:41:24	@PikFan	In the Name of Design
2016-04-20 01:41:27	@PikFan	Amen
2016-04-20 01:41:29	UltraMario	PikFan	oh, he wants you to get miitomo
2016-04-20 01:41:29	UltraMario	yes

2016-04-20 01:44:17	@PikFan	I got a facebook a while ago
2016-04-20 01:44:38	UltraMario	i only really use my facebook for logins to other sites now tbh
2016-04-20 01:44:39	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:44:40	@PikFan	and dang, people can be really critical of your political opinions
2016-04-20 01:44:54	UltraMario	and twitter is just my miitomo machine now
2016-04-20 01:44:55	@PikFan	I mean, people can be critical of political views anywhere
2016-04-20 01:44:59	UltraMario	true
2016-04-20 01:45:15	@PikFan	but on facebook, it felt like it was on another level
2016-04-20 01:45:21	ScruffyChat	a lot of people post politics on Facebook as clickbait though
2016-04-20 01:45:35	ScruffyChat	just to get attention
2016-04-20 01:45:36	UltraMario	gr8 b8 m8
2016-04-20 01:45:47	@PikFan	so I've just learned not to talk about my political views in general
2016-04-20 01:45:56	@PikFan	better that way
2016-04-20 01:46:15	UltraMario	but yeah
2016-04-20 01:46:30	@PikFan	also, lots of depressing stuff too
2016-04-20 01:46:31	UltraMario	im not really into politics
2016-04-20 01:46:46	ScruffyChat	I wasn't until this year
2016-04-20 01:46:50	UltraMario	too much videogaming to pay attention ;P
2016-04-20 01:46:57	ScruffyChat	This was not a good year to become a registered voter
2016-04-20 01:47:02	UltraMario	heh
2016-04-20 01:47:03	@PikFan	well, that's a good thing, you can block out all the negativity
2016-04-20 01:47:07	UltraMario	im still 16
2016-04-20 01:47:10	UltraMario	well
2016-04-20 01:47:19	UltraMario	i naturally try to block negativity
2016-04-20 01:47:24	 *	UltraMario is an optimist
2016-04-20 01:47:24	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-20 01:47:36	@PikFan	at the same time though, you should form a political opinion soon, because you'll be old enough to vote
2016-04-20 01:47:43	ScruffyChat	@Scruffy high-fives UltraMario for being optimistic

2016-04-20 07:49:26	Neocraftz1553	You can split into 5, btw
2016-04-20 07:50:04	Neocraftz1553	You are trying to find the Master Hammer
2016-04-20 07:50:33	Neocraftz1553	it stuns enemies, supposidly, and you have to find three pizza slices after that
2016-04-20 07:50:39	Neocraftz1553	Because Samus gets hungry, of course
2016-04-20 07:50:45	Neocraftz1553	Three Temples:

2016-04-20 07:56:31	Neocraftz1553	The game is said to release on the new Nokia 5s+ "Block" the following year

2016-04-20 11:43:25	Chiaki_Nanami	I wouldn't call this time morning but
2016-04-20 11:43:27	Chiaki_Nanami	ok
2016-04-20 11:43:46	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-04-20 11:43:47	Testyo	I looked and there were clearly downloads separately labeled 'source' and 'Windows binary'
2016-04-20 11:43:57	Yoshi2	Espyo: day two of being sick?
2016-04-20 11:45:18	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-20 11:45:22	@Espyo	yeah, my head's still not in shape
2016-04-20 11:45:56	Yoshi2	sucks
2016-04-20 11:46:07	Yoshi2	I am actually suprised I haven't been ill in a long while
2016-04-20 11:46:15	Yoshi2	as soon as it gets warm, I will probably die
2016-04-20 11:46:24	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2016-04-20 11:46:24	Chiaki_Nanami	why?
2016-04-20 11:46:34	@Espyo	this winter has probably been the worst for me of my entire life
2016-04-20 11:46:37	@Espyo	I got sick like 3 or 4 times
2016-04-20 11:46:51	Yoshi2	I didn't get sick at all somehow
2016-04-20 11:47:04	@Espyo	I guess you owe me? :|
2016-04-20 11:47:06	Yoshi2	summer might get me though
2016-04-20 11:48:16	Yoshi2	I managed to make a standalone binary for my editor
2016-04-20 11:48:46	@Espyo	always helpful
2016-04-20 11:49:09	Yoshi2	the source file is 35 kB, but with the python interpreter and the Qt modules it was 60 mb after getting rid of unused imports in the source
2016-04-20 11:49:35	Yoshi2	I managed to cut it down to 30 mb by deleting some stuff manually from the binary folder :I
2016-04-20 11:49:42	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-04-20 11:49:44	@Espyo	J had a similar problem
2016-04-20 11:49:52	@Espyo	his GC tool was like 200 MB
2016-04-20 11:49:58	Yoshi2	oh joy
2016-04-20 11:50:07	Yoshi2	how did he deal with it?
2016-04-20 11:50:16	@Espyo	I think he didn't, actually
2016-04-20 11:50:25	@Espyo	but I think I remember him saying he deleted some stuff too
2016-04-20 11:50:28	@Espyo	so probably the same thing you did
2016-04-20 11:50:40	Yoshi2	algorithm for cutting down the size:
2016-04-20 11:50:43	Yoshi2	1) delete file
2016-04-20 11:50:48	Yoshi2	2) start program
2016-04-20 11:51:07	Yoshi2	3) if it crashes, undo and goto 1)
2016-04-20 11:51:09	Yoshi2	4) done
2016-04-20 11:52:54	@Espyo	hehe yeah
2016-04-20 11:53:35	Yoshi2	for some reason there was a 20 mb dll called iucdt something
2016-04-20 11:53:51	Yoshi2	the program worked without that so I have no idea what was up
2016-04-20 11:56:55	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-20 11:59:18	Yoshi2	ah, icuin53,icuc53, icudt53
2016-04-20 11:59:22	Yoshi2	somehow related to Qt
2016-04-20 12:01:26	Yoshi2	ah, unicode lib https://wiki.qt.io/Deploying_Windows_Applications

2016-04-20 17:37:32	@PikFan	*I'm amazed how he fell for it
2016-04-20 17:37:51	@PikFan	anyone with common sense knows that water + electronics isn't a good mix
2016-04-20 17:37:57	@PikFan	much less a freaking /oven/

2016-04-20 17:38:41	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, who WOULD fall for it?
2016-04-20 17:38:45	Yoshi2	the main issue with water+electronics is that you will short something, or something could corrode
2016-04-20 17:39:02	Neocraftz1553	IT's freaking salt water
2016-04-20 17:39:14	Yoshi2	which is why you sometimes have a good chance of rescuing a device if you take out the battery quick enough
2016-04-20 17:39:25	Neocraftz1553	of course something is going to go wrong
2016-04-20 17:39:42	@PikFan	how is salt water different from regular water
2016-04-20 17:39:52	@PikFan	isn't plain water enough
2016-04-20 17:39:52	Neocraftz1553	Yoshi2: You can dry it out by wrapping it in aluminum and throw it in the oven
2016-04-20 17:40:01	Neocraftz1553	Pikfan not really
2016-04-20 17:40:02	@PikFan	lol
2016-04-20 17:40:10	Neocraftz1553	Salt water is more... corrosive
2016-04-20 17:40:27	Neocraftz1553	since it has minerals that would interact with electronics
2016-04-20 17:40:30	@PikFan	hmm

2016-04-20 21:40:02	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-20 21:40:09	@Espyo	but that probably just means to have every HUD element

2016-04-20 21:43:30	@Espyo	it's hard to say what should and shouldn't go on the wiki
2016-04-20 21:43:47	@Espyo	so let's see, the point of the wiki's articles, and the images, is to teach the reader about aspects of the series
2016-04-20 21:43:59	@Espyo	having the HUD icons for the standby Pikmin would make it more complete
2016-04-20 21:44:14	@Espyo	but it probably wouldn't teach the reader anything they can't gather from any other plain old Pikmin image
2016-04-20 21:44:24	@Espyo	so... it's a bit tricky to say if you should upload them or not
2016-04-20 21:44:34	Nvortex	but it's still more content people might be interested in having
2016-04-20 21:44:35	@Espyo	so, for stuff like that, I like to think of it a different way:
2016-04-20 21:44:54	Nvortex	and would overall make the wiki more compelte
2016-04-20 21:44:56	@Espyo	is there any other task on the wiki that I can be doing instead of thinking about what's right and wrong in the current task?
2016-04-20 21:45:00	@Espyo	if so, then I just move to the new task
2016-04-20 21:45:07	@Espyo	and worry about thinking of this task some time in the future
2016-04-20 21:45:12	@Espyo	maybe when our goals become even clearer
2016-04-20 21:45:23	@Espyo	the wiki isn't meant to be like a texture resource, though
2016-04-20 21:45:26	@Espyo	of course, it won't
2016-04-20 21:45:36	@Espyo	especially not with standby Pikmin icons on a black backdrop
2016-04-20 21:45:38	@Espyo	but even still
2016-04-20 21:45:47	@Espyo	I guess, now that you went through the trouble of making them
2016-04-20 21:45:50	@Espyo	might as well not let them go to waste
2016-04-20 21:45:53	@Espyo	they can go in the article
2016-04-20 21:46:03	@Espyo	but next time, instead of making images, and then having to decide if the wiki needs them or not
2016-04-20 21:46:12	@Espyo	focus on other tasks on the wiki that everybody is SURE are needed
2016-04-20 21:46:14	Marty2000	I'll keep them if you want, so you can think about it.
2016-04-20 21:46:24	@Espyo	nah, I think it's fair to say you can upload them
2016-04-20 21:47:16	Marty2000	Well, ok.

2016-04-20 22:24:50	@Espyo	so... what are you meant to call an individual item in a patch of grass?
2016-04-20 22:24:56	@Espyo	because apparently a "blade" of grass is wrong
2016-04-20 22:26:55	ScruffyChat	Blade should be correct
2016-04-20 22:27:00	ScruffyChat	A blade of grass
2016-04-20 22:27:20	ScruffyChat	That's one individual unit of grass
2016-04-20 22:27:38	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-20 22:27:56	@Espyo	iunno, I'm watching a video, and this guy just said blade, and was like "before the comments section lets me know, yes, I know 'blade' is wrong"
2016-04-20 22:28:07	@Espyo	plus, I remember searching this ages ago, and couldn't find anything about "blade of grass" on google
2016-04-20 22:28:13	@Espyo	it's as if I made it up in mind
2016-04-20 22:28:21	@Espyo	but if you're telling me it's right... then I guess it is

2016-04-21 00:02:28	Neocraftz1553	The updates are awsome
2016-04-21 00:02:54	Neocraftz1553	Pikfan, can the new featured image be the Sandbox mode screenshot?
2016-04-21 00:04:11	@PikFan	sure, why not
2016-04-21 00:06:26	Neocraftz1553	It makes me think of what fanon is about, for some reason

2016-04-21 00:12:40	Neocraftz1553	I don't know... It for some reason makes me think of people coming together to share ideas and make their creations come to life

2016-04-21 00:22:27	Neocraftz1553	but hey, will they include Edward and DELTA?

2016-04-21 00:34:23	ScruffyChat	whiter parts are glossier, darker parts are more diffuse

2016-04-21 02:57:28	En_Passant	You could also buff their health so it takes more treasures
2016-04-21 02:57:39	ScruffyChat	I was also thinking, I'll have to see if I can edit this...
2016-04-21 02:57:48	ScruffyChat	but one enemy could have fast regeneration
2016-04-21 02:58:08	ScruffyChat	So fast that beating it isn't about the time it takes, but the number of Pikmin attacking at once, to keep the health down
2016-04-21 02:59:10	En_Passant	Toady Bloyster
2016-04-21 02:59:33	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2016-04-21 02:59:36	En_Passant	Also, plz have more than one
2016-04-21 03:00:12	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, most assuredly

2016-04-21 03:16:28	Neocraftz1553	Glossy Periscorp?
2016-04-21 03:16:53	ScruffyChat	That's good
2016-04-21 03:16:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2016-04-21 03:18:35	En_Passant	Neo, it's a scorpion with its head where the stinger usually is
2016-04-21 03:20:00	ScruffyChat	En_Passant: now that I think about it, the whip scorpion has a pretty thin barb, I might put the Vinegrak's head elsewhere
2016-04-21 03:20:16	En_Passant	Yeah, that was my thought when I saw the picture
2016-04-21 03:20:30	Neocraftz1553	Picture?
2016-04-21 03:20:44	En_Passant	Picture of a whip scorpion
2016-04-21 03:20:52	En_Passant	No Vikegrak render yet, sorry
2016-04-21 03:21:08	Neocraftz1553	Can somebody bring me up-to-date?
2016-04-21 03:21:21	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-21 03:21:21	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-21 03:21:50	En_Passant	I happen to have a similar enemy
2016-04-21 03:22:22	ScruffyChat	That he just named the Glossy Periscorp
2016-04-21 03:22:32	ScruffyChat	Periscorp, I love it
2016-04-21 03:22:58	En_Passant	Feel free to use it, we can make them a family
2016-04-21 03:23:13	En_Passant	Vinegrak doesn't really have a scorpion impression anyway
2016-04-21 03:23:32	ScruffyChat	I based it off the nickname for whip scorpions, vinegarroons
2016-04-21 03:23:33	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok, love doin that
2016-04-21 03:24:01	ScruffyChat	Because they secrete acretic acid when disturbed
2016-04-21 03:24:25	ScruffyChat	I was thinking Vinegraks could shake Pikmin off by secreting an acid that makes them panic
2016-04-21 03:25:29	Neocraftz1553	Maybe a Firey Periscorp that shoots fire balls, they don't do anything special besides lighting an are on the ground on fire temporarily 
2016-04-21 03:25:30	Neocraftz1553	ah, like the Toady Bloyster
2016-04-21 03:25:45	En_Passant	You could make it poison, if you want something else for White Pikmin to take on
2016-04-21 03:26:18	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-21 03:26:18	Neocraftz1553	to make Whites useful again
2016-04-21 03:26:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah

2016-04-21 03:30:31	En_Passant	heh, Minish

2016-04-21 03:57:15	ScruffyChat	Hey CreativeSushi!
2016-04-21 03:57:35	ScruffyChat	Nvortex: There are, but they're called something else I think
2016-04-21 03:58:12	Nvortex	the blowhog?
2016-04-21 03:59:15	En_Passant	back
2016-04-21 03:59:26	En_Passant	There's an enemy called Puffstool in Minish Cap, yes
2016-04-21 03:59:37	En_Passant	But only in English; the two have different Japanese names
2016-04-21 04:02:50	CreativeSushi	yeah the blowhog Nvortex
2016-04-21 04:27:52	En_Passant	What's a good family name for these guys
2016-04-21 04:28:13	En_Passant	I'm thinking something involving the word "buff" because mine and presumably yours don't have claws
2016-04-21 04:30:42	ScruffyChat	yeah
2016-04-21 04:34:53	Nvortex	for the scorpion?
2016-04-21 04:35:13	Nvortex	what else are their abilities
2016-04-21 04:35:54	ScruffyChat	Mine only appear if you choose to extend the day partially into nighttime
2016-04-21 04:37:01	En_Passant	Mine just has its head replacing its stinger, which is its only vulnerable part
2016-04-21 04:37:22	Nvortex	oh wait, they have no claws
2016-04-21 04:37:23	Nvortex	uhm
2016-04-21 04:37:34	Nvortex	i was going to say something but now...
2016-04-21 04:40:09	Nvortex	this are synonyms for the word "long" since the head is on the tail, what about combining one of those words with something else http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/long
2016-04-21 04:42:24	ScruffyChat	hehe I was thinking of "arthropod" for a second, then combined "buff" and got "buffalopod"
2016-04-21 04:42:45	Nvortex	i was thinking on arachnid
2016-04-21 04:44:36	Nvortex	pikmin 4 is looking good https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Pseudo-ara%C3%B1a_nocturna_%28opilion%29.jpg

2016-04-21 05:09:58	En_Passant	Nvortex's pictures gave me an idea
2016-04-21 05:10:33	En_Passant	One of them had a "solifuge" in it
2016-04-21 05:10:35	En_Passant	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae
2016-04-21 05:11:01	En_Passant	They lack a tail, but they also lack claws
2016-04-21 05:11:52	ScruffyChat	Hmmmm
2016-04-21 05:12:46	En_Passant	Caudifuge
2016-04-21 05:13:13	ScruffyChat	Works for me
2016-04-21 05:13:18	ScruffyChat	But where'd you get it?
2016-04-21 05:13:24	En_Passant	caudal = taillike
2016-04-21 05:13:28	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-21 05:13:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that works!
2016-04-21 05:16:03	En_Passant	We could make the page for it, but neither of our enemies have pages yet
2016-04-21 05:16:11	En_Passant	Probably not worth it
2016-04-21 05:16:29	ScruffyChat	Yeah, not yet
2016-04-21 05:16:45	ScruffyChat	But I will at least note the change on my Piklopedia page for now
2016-04-21 05:18:10	En_Passant	I have everything saved on an Excel sheet
2016-04-21 05:18:18	En_Passant	I should really put it on the wiki lol
2016-04-21 05:18:33	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-21 05:19:17	ScruffyChat	I really should make more spreadsheets for info like that
2016-04-21 05:19:34	ScruffyChat	I only really started when I was mapping Challenge Mode stages and prizes
2016-04-21 05:25:45	En_Passant	I'm still trying do decide if I should add something else to my Mission Mode besides collection
2016-04-21 05:32:40	ScruffyChat	I feel like collecting things, growing Pikmin, and defeating enemies are all different enough to be separate goals in Mission Mode
2016-04-21 05:32:52	ScruffyChat	Since they make you think differently about your approach
2016-04-21 05:33:17	En_Passant	Somewhat, yes
2016-04-21 05:33:29	En_Passant	Growing Pikmin is basically the other two combined
2016-04-21 05:35:32	ScruffyChat	yeah
2016-04-21 05:36:17	En_Passant	I also don't have Battle Enemie
2016-04-21 05:36:20	En_Passant	*Enemies
2016-04-21 05:36:28	ScruffyChat	Right
2016-04-21 05:36:34	ScruffyChat	You don't need it really
2016-04-21 05:36:53	En_Passant	So the two I have are the same basic concept (bring things to base), but one is about using the resources you are given and the other is building up an army
2016-04-21 05:37:51	En_Passant	I was thinking about adding something similar to your Challenge Mode, where the end goal is completely different

2016-04-21 05:39:09	ScruffyChat	Or just with the regular rules?
2016-04-21 05:39:52	En_Passant	Both, kind of
2016-04-21 05:40:07	En_Passant	I was looking at Enemy Cave and Marble Escort specifically
2016-04-21 05:40:23	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-21 05:40:46	En_Passant	I guess they both have the same premise of "get to the end"
2016-04-21 05:40:53	En_Passant	Which is similar to my caves
2016-04-21 05:41:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-21 05:41:58	ScruffyChat	although with Marble Escort the speed of getting to the end is out of your hands
2016-04-21 05:42:17	ScruffyChat	I plan to have it so that the Purple Pikmin cannot be under your contorl
2016-04-21 05:42:20	En_Passant	And that's why everyone hates escort missions
2016-04-21 05:42:21	ScruffyChat	control*
2016-04-21 05:42:28	ScruffyChat	Yeah...
2016-04-21 05:42:32	ScruffyChat	I guess that's true
2016-04-21 05:42:49	ScruffyChat	Maybe I should give Purple Pikmin control
2016-04-21 05:43:26	En_Passant	Or make you use your own Pikmin to carry it
2016-04-21 05:44:23	ScruffyChat	True
2016-04-21 05:44:27	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-21 05:44:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I actually like that better
2016-04-21 05:56:36	ScruffyChat	I've gotta go for now
2016-04-21 05:56:44	ScruffyChat	I might be on tomorrow but it's a busy day

2016-04-21 15:50:43	Marty2000	Personally, I think it's fine too, as long as you let know other people what you said about them if you mentioned their name
2016-04-21 15:50:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-21 15:51:03	@Espyo	although if the point is to have a long conversation, it might be best to do it in a private message
2016-04-21 15:51:06	@Espyo	or in a different channel
2016-04-21 15:51:15	@Espyo	otherwise it just starts spamming this channel, and other people can't really join

2016-04-21 19:42:31	UltraMario	like my bonus characters
2016-04-21 19:43:00	UltraMario	a majority of those are cut stuff, and the joke ones are trophies and a poke ball pokemon

2016-04-21 19:46:09	Marty2000	Good idea
2016-04-21 19:46:13	UltraMario	thnx
2016-04-21 19:46:33	UltraMario	oh yeah, and the reason im allowing fox's alt that looks like wolf, even though that isnt an alt in melee, i figured since wolf is in the intro,  i'd reference that in some form :P
2016-04-21 19:46:48	UltraMario	rip wolf :(
2016-04-21 19:47:40	Marty2000	At least Fox has some custom moves that can be used similarly to that of Wolf...

2016-04-21 21:55:27	ScruffyM	Hi Nvortexl
2016-04-21 21:55:31	Neocraftz1553	Hello Scruffy, Nvortex

2016-04-21 21:55:44	ScruffyM	I can't stay for long
2016-04-21 21:55:51	Nvortex	you said it right the first time :v
2016-04-21 21:56:06	Nvortex	oh wait i thought taht was a " ! !
2016-04-21 21:57:15	Nvortex	is the "M" from "mobile"
2016-04-21 21:57:27	ScruffyM	Yep
2016-04-21 21:57:49	Neocraftz1553	ahh, I see
2016-04-21 21:58:05	Nvortex	what are your thoughts in the canon ending discussion
2016-04-21 21:58:21	Nvortex	we had been talking about it for days consecutively in the skype chat
2016-04-21 21:58:25	ScruffyM	I think either endig works
2016-04-21 21:58:35	ScruffyM	So it doesn't really matter
2016-04-21 22:00:38	En_Passant	Of 3?
2016-04-21 22:00:43	ScruffyM	Both allow Hocotate Freight to end up in the state that it is in P3, and Olimar to become fed up with Louie, after enough time has passed
2016-04-21 22:00:52	ScruffyM	Of Pikmin 2
2016-04-21 22:01:32	ScruffyM	The discussion is whether the canon ending is leaving Louie behind after the debt, or rescuing him and coming back
2016-04-21 22:02:12	ScruffyM	It's claimed that P3 evidences the former as being canon, making the Wistful Wild and the Titan Dweevil after-credit extras
2016-04-21 22:02:27	En_Passant	I don't know where they got that from
2016-04-21 22:02:49	En_Passant	Olimar is clearly travelling with Louie in his videos
2016-04-21 22:02:56	En_Passant	So he had to have rescued him
2016-04-21 22:03:21	ScruffyM	right, but the discussion is whether he rescued him and then went back, or not
2016-04-21 22:03:26	ScruffyM	I... Guess
2016-04-21 22:03:27	Nvortex	hey en passant you should comment in the forums on this topic
2016-04-21 22:03:56	ScruffyM	In p3 Olimar states it's his third time setting foot on the planet
2016-04-21 22:04:16	ScruffyM	When it would be his forth, if P2 were completely followed
2016-04-21 22:04:26	ScruffyM	Fourth*
2016-04-21 22:04:38	Nvortex	he actually said his third visit, if you dont count the one in pikmin 1 because it wasnt on purpose, he has done 3 travels
2016-04-21 22:04:39	En_Passant	He says it's his third visit
2016-04-21 22:04:56	ScruffyM	That's what I said
2016-04-21 22:05:02	En_Passant	I personally thought he just counted both of the Pikmin 2 ones as one visit
2016-04-21 22:05:11	ScruffyM	Me too
2016-04-21 22:05:16	Nvortex	i do too
2016-04-21 22:05:45	ScruffyM	And I guess there's also the argument that the Hocotate ship isn't gilded in P3
2016-04-21 22:06:09	ScruffyM	But if Hocotate has a debt, you know they'd get sell the gold
2016-04-21 22:06:12	Nvortex	i always assumed they sold the hull
2016-04-21 22:06:32	Nvortex	or maybe it was cheap paint they bought for .99 pokos :v
2016-04-21 22:06:33	ScruffyM	Yeah
2016-04-21 22:06:37	ScruffyM	Heh
2016-04-21 22:06:45	En_Passant	I thought the gold ship was the President's personal model
2016-04-21 22:07:23	ScruffyM	I considered it the same ship, since it replaces the sales pitch icon
2016-04-21 22:07:35	En_Passant	Since they just paid of the debt, they wouldn't have any spare money to paint the ship
2016-04-21 22:08:20	ScruffyM	yeah
2016-04-21 22:08:30	Nvortex	i alway thought there were 2 ships until i played the game again and realized the ship said they painted him
2016-04-21 22:08:57	En_Passant	Does it?
2016-04-21 22:09:08	Nvortex	....now i don't remember
2016-04-21 22:09:29	Nvortex	the ship syas something that maybe they can get a paint job or something but then says no because he is unique
2016-04-21 22:10:01	ScruffyM	Then everyone will gaudily clad in gold, like me! ...No. I am unique. And beautiful. Yes.

2016-04-21 22:14:26	ScruffyM	But either ending to Pikmin 2 /can/ set up Pikmin 3, I suppose
2016-04-21 22:15:24	En_Passant	If you want to get technical
2016-04-21 22:15:40	En_Passant	The President wouldn't appear in any Data Files if he never went
2016-04-21 22:15:52	ScruffyM	Yeah
2016-04-21 22:16:25	ScruffyM	And Olimar wouldn't say "We" when referring to who was sent back to PNF-404 in P3, he would say "I"
2016-04-21 22:16:51	En_Passant	He and Louie
2016-04-21 22:16:57	ScruffyM	That Data File point is really good
2016-04-21 22:18:10	Nvortex	i don't think the data file has anything to do with the president being there
2016-04-21 22:18:24	Nvortex	in area hints olimar says that the rpesident is in the beach on vacation
2016-04-21 22:18:45	Nvortex	or is he on a vacation? he just says that he is in a beack

2016-04-21 22:41:16	Testyo	It's also explained need winrar
2016-04-21 22:43:11	Marty2000	"It's also explained need winrar"
2016-04-21 22:43:16	Marty2000	?
2016-04-21 23:00:02	Marty2000	"Something Most Pepole Don't know Is that If you hold the control stick left or right And then dismiss. You can spread your pikmin more apart. Just make sure they go as FAR left or right before dismissing." Is that true? I didn't know that, it's... strange.
2016-04-21 23:00:11	Marty2000	Anyway, it needs to be cleaned up
2016-04-21 23:02:43	Marty2000	"If you Quickly Move the control Stick While throwing pikmin you can throw them more faster (GameCube version)" I think it's mentioned here ;) http://www.pikminwiki.com/Throw#Group_move_trick
2016-04-21 23:04:31	Nvortex	it's true
2016-04-21 23:05:00	Nvortex	oh but the first thing you mentioned, i dont know
2016-04-21 23:05:13	Marty2000	It's a recent edit made on the wiki
2016-04-21 23:06:29	Marty2000	Wait I'm playing Pikmin 2 I'm going to try
2016-04-21 23:06:54	Nvortex	is it for pikmin 2?
2016-04-21 23:07:19	Marty2000	The editor doesn't mention which game it is for, so I'll try for both.
2016-04-21 23:07:25	Marty2000	Pikmin and Pikmin 2
2016-04-21 23:07:34	Marty2000	In Pikmin 3, you can move while dismissing
2016-04-21 23:07:43	Marty2000	can't
2016-04-21 23:08:29	Marty2000	Eh... dismissing while moving or not, it doesn't change anything in Pikmin 2
2016-04-21 23:10:41	Nvortex	that seemed to me like something from pikmin 1 thats why i was weirded out that you mentioned pikmin 2
2016-04-21 23:11:31	Marty2000	Seems it does not change anything in Pikmin (1) either
2016-04-21 23:15:48	Marty2000	Well, after a few attempst, it seems that "You can spread your pikmin more apart." is quite true
2016-04-21 23:16:09	Marty2000	attempts*
2016-04-21 23:17:21	Nvortex	Just make sure they go as FAR left or right before dismissing
2016-04-21 23:18:43	Marty2000	It seems quite true, but personally, I think it's not really a tip but rather normal in the gameplay
2016-04-21 23:27:42	Marty2000	Espyo, do you think the two recent edits should be added in the "Trivia section" and be rewritten?
2016-04-21 23:28:06	@Espyo	sorry, I didn't really pay attention to them
2016-04-21 23:28:09	@Espyo	still feeling a bit under
2016-04-21 23:28:14	Marty2000	Ah, sorry
2016-04-21 23:28:15	@Espyo	are these about the weird dismiss and throw things?
2016-04-21 23:28:22	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-21 23:29:16	@Espyo	well, the quick throw one can be removed, and on the summary, it should be explained that that info is on the Throw article
2016-04-21 23:29:24	@Espyo	which should be linked to on the Controls article
2016-04-21 23:29:26	@Espyo	I think it already is
2016-04-21 23:29:30	@Espyo	yeah, it is
2016-04-21 23:29:37	@Espyo	as for the dismiss, it can go under the dismiss article
2016-04-21 23:29:42	@Espyo	but it really needs to be explained better
2016-04-21 23:29:46	@Espyo	I can't understand a single thing about it
2016-04-21 23:29:48	Marty2000	yes it is http://www.pikminwiki.com/Throw#Group_move_trick
2016-04-21 23:30:09	@Espyo	oh, I meant that the Controls article should have a link to the Throw article (and it does)
2016-04-21 23:33:07	Marty2000	For the dismiss, I tried, and it may be true that "Pikmin spread more apart"... but I really don't know if it's a big thing. If you want to keep it, I think we should move it to the dismiss article, as you said, with a template?
2016-04-21 23:34:00	@Espyo	a template? I don't remember mentioning one :/
2016-04-21 23:34:15	@Espyo	but anyway, I don't know... I can't really see what the effect is
2016-04-21 23:34:20	@Espyo	it could be neat to include for completion's sake
2016-04-21 23:34:32	@Espyo	but if it's just a normal result of a normal mechanic, it's probably pointless to include it
2016-04-21 23:35:35	Marty2000	move it to the dismiss article, as you said. And why not add a template like "this should be explained better"? (sorry for not correctly explaining things, by the way)
2016-04-21 23:35:58	Marty2000	I think it's a normal mechanic

2016-04-22 00:01:21	Nvortex	that doesnt mean the president was there
2016-04-22 00:02:03	En_Passant	Why would he use the President as an example if he has no reason to?
2016-04-22 00:02:41	Nvortex	what?
2016-04-22 00:03:49	En_Passant	He easily could've drawn the picture with just himself and Louie. Given that the President is lazy, he wouldn't have bothered to draw a scenario where the President is on the planet unless he had a reason to believe that the President would go there
2016-04-22 00:04:34	En_Passant	Such as the President actually going there
2016-04-22 00:04:49	Nvortex	what are you trying to prove? that the president was there in pikmin 3 or that the president went to the planet?
2016-04-22 00:05:08	En_Passant	That the President went to the planet
2016-04-22 00:05:21	En_Passant	The only time that's shown is post-debt

2016-04-22 00:06:05	Nvortex	i was just saying that he never went on pikmin 3
2016-04-22 00:06:19	En_Passant	yeah
2016-04-22 00:06:50	En_Passant	The argument on the forum is if anything after paying the debt is canon

2016-04-22 19:27:02	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Collectible_article_policy  Do you really need a screenshot for each area the collectible appears in? I want to add some screenshots here 
2016-04-22 19:27:05	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Insect_Condo
2016-04-22 19:27:30	Marty2000	But articles like http://www.pikminwiki.com/Citrus_Lump do not "respect" the policy. So I'm just asking
2016-04-22 19:31:59	@Espyo	think of it this way:
2016-04-22 19:32:05	@Espyo	a lot of articles currently don't follow a lot of the policies
2016-04-22 19:32:07	@Espyo	they should
2016-04-22 19:32:13	@Espyo	but it's simply because nobody actually implemented them yet
2016-04-22 19:32:22	@Espyo	it makes sense... there's like 250 total collectibles in the series
2016-04-22 19:32:24	@Espyo	it's a lot of work...
2016-04-22 19:32:39	@Espyo	but that policy only refers to story mode locations
2016-04-22 19:32:59	@Espyo	so in the case of the Insect Condo, it only appears once in P2 and P3's story mode
2016-04-22 19:33:38	Marty2000	Oh, okay, thanks for telling me. At first I was thinking you'd need screenshots for every mission mode area too
2016-04-22 19:34:00	@Espyo	I don't know, I think that's too overkill
2016-04-22 19:34:10	@Espyo	for Challenge Mode, it's really too much
2016-04-22 19:34:19	@Espyo	since the locations of treasures are kinda random anyway, so...
2016-04-22 19:34:37	@Espyo	as for Mission Mode, I guess the player is more interested in getting all fruits in a mission
2016-04-22 19:34:42	@Espyo	not so much getting SPECIFIC fruits
2016-04-22 19:34:51	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-22 19:35:05	@Espyo	plus, if the players want to know where a certain fruit is in a given mission
2016-04-22 19:35:14	@Espyo	we should have a quick description of its location
2016-04-22 19:35:16	@Espyo	but no need for images
2016-04-22 19:36:03	Marty2000	Plus there would be too many images for the Insect Condo in Mission Mode
2016-04-22 19:36:12	@Espyo	yeah, yeah

2016-04-23 08:46:41	Neocraftz1553	Hello everyone
2016-04-23 08:46:53	Yoshi2	hi neo
2016-04-23 08:49:38	Neocraftz1553	http://m.wikihow.com/Roll-in-Parkour/Free-Running
2016-04-23 08:49:56	Neocraftz1553	Somewhat the technique to land off a high surface...
2016-04-23 08:50:52	Neocraftz1553	SOMEWHAT though
2016-04-23 08:52:42	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, 1 AM here...
2016-04-23 08:53:00	Neocraftz1553	around 1 AM, anyways
2016-04-23 08:54:42	Neocraftz1553	I can't go to sleep while its hot...
2016-04-23 08:55:35	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: hmmm, but that technique requires you to land and then do a roll
2016-04-23 08:55:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah, thats why I said Somewhat...
2016-04-23 08:56:18	Neocraftz1553	The other one requires you to tuck into a roll mid-air, if memory serves
2016-04-23 08:56:50	Yoshi2	and doing a roll without landing will just make it more likely to break something vital, especially if you don't know how to do it correctly
2016-04-23 08:57:05	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-23 08:57:53	Neocraftz1553	I think its better to try to slow your momentum down by grabbing onto branches and such if you are near them, like in a steep slope
2016-04-23 08:58:34	Neocraftz1553	In mid air its better to steer somewhere soft, like a plowed field...
2016-04-23 08:58:53	Neocraftz1553	then again, everything will hit you like concrete when you land...
2016-04-23 08:59:33	Yoshi2	http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-a-Long-Fall
2016-04-23 09:00:30	Neocraftz1553	there
2016-04-23 09:00:42	Neocraftz1553	Hey
2016-04-23 09:00:50	Neocraftz1553	what day is it?
2016-04-23 09:00:56	Neocraftz1553	Saturday here
2016-04-23 09:02:00	Yoshi2	nothing about doing a roll
2016-04-23 09:02:21	Yoshi2	though I think Link does a roll when jumping from heights, so maybe there is some truth
2016-04-23 09:02:34	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-23 09:02:58	Neocraftz1553	No wonder mario dies easier from a long height 
2016-04-23 09:03:11	Yoshi2	mario can break the fall by doing a stomp
2016-04-23 09:03:21	Neocraftz1553	hmm, maybe if we do it...
2016-04-23 09:03:49	Neocraftz1553	and Sonic doesn't seem to take damage from heights either...
2016-04-23 09:04:00	Yoshi2	anyway, if you are falling from such a low height that rolling could help, you probably have better chances of survival if you do the things written on that page
2016-04-23 09:04:01	Neocraftz1553	soo.... just wear rings? 
2016-04-23 09:04:11	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-23 09:04:29	Neocraftz1553	What about ground pounding?
2016-04-23 09:04:36	Yoshi2	rip your butt

2016-04-23 09:08:02	Yoshi2	"People very seldom survive falls from heights of 100 feet (30.5 m) or above, and mortality is high even at heights of 20–30 feet (6.1–9.1 m). It is always best not to fall at all."
2016-04-23 09:08:20	Yoshi2	protip: don't fall at all
2016-04-23 09:08:26	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-23 09:08:35	Yoshi2	that is the best tip here

2016-04-23 12:59:55	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2016-04-23 13:00:14	Marty2000	Hi
2016-04-23 13:04:22	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-04-23 13:04:23	Testyo	ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ WELCOME TO THE RED BULBORB I MENTIONED BECAME A PELLET POSY
2016-04-23 13:16:28	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-23 13:16:33	@Espyo	Testyo plz
2016-04-23 13:16:33	Testyo	do you buy something used and format it, or do you guys death penalties but too bad we don't have em here
2016-04-23 13:17:23	Yoshi2	yes, instead of buying something used and formatting it, we do death penalties
2016-04-23 13:17:52	Yoshi2	but pshh, it's a secret
2016-04-23 13:29:19	Marty2000	Is someone here going to participate to the Splatfest?
2016-04-23 13:31:50	Yoshi2	I probably won't, got homework to do
2016-04-23 13:33:55	Yoshi2	now I have to compress this 1280x720 60fps footage I have of me using my editor
2016-04-23 13:34:33	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-23 13:37:56	Yoshi2	............... the footage is screwed, pretty laggy
2016-04-23 13:38:11	Yoshi2	there goes the 60fps dream, I guess
2016-04-23 13:42:19	@Espyo	I will
2016-04-23 13:42:21	@Espyo	#TeamPatrick
2016-04-23 13:42:25	@Espyo	when does it start?
2016-04-23 13:43:19	Marty2000	In a quarter of hour I think
2016-04-23 13:43:38	Marty2000	I don't even remember my team, I haven't played for a long time... I'll start my game
2016-04-23 13:43:46	Yoshi2	that is a complicated way to say "15 minutes"
2016-04-23 13:44:29	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-23 13:44:31	Marty2000	Ha ha, sorry... I am used to saying things like that...
2016-04-23 13:44:32	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-23 13:44:46	@Espyo	how weird, Yoshi2
2016-04-23 13:44:54	@Espyo	I understood where Marty was coming from
2016-04-23 13:44:57	@Espyo	it's weird that you didn't
2016-04-23 13:45:20	@Espyo	"a quarter of an hour" is the literal translation of expressions you use in your day to day life, in our languages
2016-04-23 13:45:26	@Espyo	"um quarto de hora"
2016-04-23 13:45:35	@Espyo	it's just as common as saying "15 minutos"
2016-04-23 13:45:40	Yoshi2	hm yes
2016-04-23 13:45:42	@Espyo	I can only assume it's the same for Marty
2016-04-23 13:45:45	@Espyo	but not over there?
2016-04-23 13:45:58	Yoshi2	in einer Viertelstunde
2016-04-23 13:45:59	Yoshi2	or so
2016-04-23 13:46:06	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-23 13:46:11	Marty2000	Yes Espyo, it's the same here
2016-04-23 13:46:14	Marty2000	Un quart d'heure
2016-04-23 13:46:16	@Espyo	hehe
2016-04-23 13:46:20	@Espyo	I love finding out these similarities
2016-04-23 13:46:24	@Espyo	and cultural differences
2016-04-23 13:46:33	@Espyo	in English-speaking countries, saying "a quarter of an hour" is completely non-existent
2016-04-23 13:46:37	@Espyo	even if it is right
2016-04-23 13:46:45	@Espyo	but for us Romantic-language users... it's just normal
2016-04-23 13:46:52	@Espyo	(our languages ARE Romantic languages, right?)
2016-04-23 13:46:55	@Espyo	(I never know the right term)
2016-04-23 13:46:59	Marty2000	Yes, that's true
2016-04-23 13:47:09	Marty2000	Roman languages?
2016-04-23 13:47:20	Marty2000	Romance
2016-04-23 13:47:28	@Espyo	Romance... I think that's it
2016-04-23 13:47:39	Yoshi2	the german word for "quarter" is "viertel" so I guess that's why I didn't make the connection
2016-04-23 13:47:40	@Espyo	yeah, that's it
2016-04-23 13:47:43	@Espyo	Romance languages
2016-04-23 13:47:48	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-04-23 13:47:50	@Espyo	interesting
2016-04-23 13:47:54	Marty2000	Well, I'm in Team Patrick too
2016-04-23 13:47:58	@Espyo	yay!
2016-04-23 13:48:15	Marty2000	Great
2016-04-23 13:48:26	Marty2000	What weapons do you use?
2016-04-23 13:48:37	@Espyo	I might switch around throughout
2016-04-23 13:48:43	@Espyo	but honestly... I use all weapons
2016-04-23 13:48:47	@Espyo	depends on what I'm feeling, and on the maps
2016-04-23 13:49:01	@Espyo	oh, but I bought the Kelp Splatterscope, so I'll try to use that
2016-04-23 13:49:11	@Espyo	see how much of a difference it makes compared to the regular Splatterscope
2016-04-23 13:49:18	Marty2000	Oh, that's the same for me (even though I prefer weapons with Bubblers)
2016-04-23 13:49:24	@Espyo	...I don't buy weapons often, that's why I only NOW am trying the Kelp
2016-04-23 13:49:40	@Espyo	yeah, I also use the Tri-Slosher every once in a while
2016-04-23 13:49:42	Marty2000	I used to play with the Kelp Splatterscope for a while, it's better according to me
2016-04-23 13:49:45	@Espyo	the Bubbler's pretty helpful
2016-04-23 13:49:51	@Espyo	is it? hmm, that's good to know
2016-04-23 13:50:04	Yoshi2	I found the gatling/bucket to be pretty neat
2016-04-23 13:50:17	@Espyo	I could never really get into the gatling guns...
2016-04-23 13:50:19	@Espyo	I keep retrying
2016-04-23 13:50:23	Marty2000	Yes, especially the Zink Mini Splatling
2016-04-23 13:50:28	@Espyo	we need to add each other as friends, but I've got lunch now
2016-04-23 13:50:28	@Espyo	brb
2016-04-23 13:50:35	Marty2000	I use some Speed Up bonuses with it
2016-04-23 13:50:52	Marty2000	Enjoy your meal, then
2016-04-23 13:52:17	Yoshi2	no, don't enjoy your meal

2016-04-23 13:54:47	Marty2000	My equipment for the Zink Mini Splatling
2016-04-23 13:55:17	Yoshi2	it's really funny how we always say "enjoy your meal" or something like that when somebody eats
2016-04-23 13:55:25	Yoshi2	but the inverse of that sounds pretty silly
2016-04-23 13:56:01	Marty2000	Yes, that's true
2016-04-23 13:59:03	Marty2000	Well, the Splatfest is about to begin. I think I'll record it
2016-04-23 13:59:24	Marty2000	It's been a long time since my last Splatfest.
2016-04-23 13:59:38	Marty2000	Is the multiplier (for points) still 6?

2016-04-23 14:05:51	Marty2000	Here are the stages
2016-04-23 14:33:50	@Espyo	I think I'm going Inkbrush
2016-04-23 14:34:01	@Espyo	yeah, actually, the Inkbrush is one of the weapons I've been using the most recently
2016-04-23 14:34:06	@Espyo	and it's INCREDIBLY powerful
2016-04-23 14:34:20	@Espyo	this one match, I got 1874 points, 10/0 k/d
2016-04-23 14:34:41	Marty2000	Yes, I love the Inkbrush too
2016-04-23 14:34:45	Marty2000	Especially the Nouveau
2016-04-23 14:34:58	@Espyo	what does the Noveau change?
2016-04-23 14:35:07	Marty2000	Bubbler and Ink Mine
2016-04-23 14:35:08	@Espyo	I never really looked for alternatives, since the stock Inkbrush is already a monster at inking
2016-04-23 14:35:16	@Espyo	I mean, a Sprinkler and an Inkstrike? you can't get any better than that
2016-04-23 14:35:20	@Espyo	oh, it's a defensive approach
2016-04-23 14:35:22	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-23 14:35:25	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-23 14:35:28	@Espyo	I prefer to just avoid combat, if I'm using the Inkbrush
2016-04-23 14:35:38	@Espyo	if I can be sneaky and get a kill, sure
2016-04-23 14:35:41	@Espyo	but if not, I'd rather run away
2016-04-23 14:36:29	Marty2000	I usually use the Inkbrush to assist my teammates but sometimes, I go alone with it and my Bubbler. The Ink Mine is also good with this weapon because you can trap someone in a corner
2016-04-23 14:36:46	Marty2000	But the regular version is better if you want to ink a lot
2016-04-23 14:37:03	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-04-23 14:38:20	Marty2000	Well, I'm going to start the Splatfest too, using the Zink Mini Splatling first, then maybe the Inkbrush Nouveau
2016-04-23 14:39:02	@Espyo	all right
2016-04-23 14:39:08	@Espyo	I'll join in a few
2016-04-23 14:39:12	@Espyo	too bad you can't play with friends on Splatfest
2016-04-23 14:39:17	@Espyo	but I guess it would make it all too easy
2016-04-23 14:39:21	Marty2000	Yes :/
2016-04-23 14:39:43	Marty2000	However, I managed to reunite with two friends once
2016-04-23 14:40:01	Marty2000	It's still possible, but you need luck...
2016-04-23 14:40:03	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-04-23 14:41:09	Marty2000	When we had finished a match, we waited and then joined all at the same moment
2016-04-23 14:42:13	Marty2000	It's like the Island in Animal Crossing New Leaf. I don't know if you played that game, but you can meet your friends in the international island with luck
2016-04-23 14:42:55	@Espyo	I never played it, no
2016-04-23 14:43:06	@Espyo	hm, me and some friends tried doing just that several times, during the first few Splatfests
2016-04-23 14:43:16	@Espyo	but we never got that luck
2016-04-23 14:44:51	Marty2000	Starts well, "the connection is unstable" :/
2016-04-23 14:53:25	@Espyo	the usual...
2016-04-23 14:53:27	@Espyo	I'd expect nothing else
2016-04-23 14:53:39	Marty2000	My second match was against Team Patrick...
2016-04-23 14:53:58	Marty2000	Seems we're more in this team
2016-04-23 14:54:11	@Espyo	I can COMPLETELY imagine myself saying the last three messages you said
2016-04-23 14:54:12	@Espyo	like
2016-04-23 14:54:13	@Espyo	verbatim
2016-04-23 14:55:17	Marty2000	Lol, I'm going to battle against Team Patrick agai...
2016-04-23 14:59:20	Marty2000	Oh, so now you can win up to 8 points? It was only 5 at the beginning
2016-04-23 14:59:41	Marty2000	Again, against Team Patrick.?..
2016-04-23 14:59:44	Marty2000	...*
2016-04-23 15:02:18	@Espyo	yeah, they changed the formula
2016-04-23 15:02:29	@Espyo	ugh, that's not inspiring a whole lot of confidence for me :/
2016-04-23 15:02:34	@Espyo	confidence that this'll be a fun Splatfest
2016-04-23 15:03:06	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-23 15:04:34	Marty2000	Oh, miracle! I'm against the Spongebob team
2016-04-23 15:05:09	@Espyo	hurray
2016-04-23 15:07:51	Marty2000	Well, we've lost, though
2016-04-23 15:09:02	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-23 15:09:20	Marty2000	And again, against Team Patrick. Are you also against TP?
2016-04-23 15:13:32	@Espyo	I haven't started yet
2016-04-23 15:13:40	Marty2000	Oh ok
2016-04-23 15:13:41	@Espyo	but I honestly wouldn't be surprised...
2016-04-23 15:14:35	Marty2000	So far, I've fought the other team only twice

2016-04-23 15:29:06	Marty2000	Strange
2016-04-23 15:29:36	@Espyo	reminds me of a similar bug I had on the engine
2016-04-23 15:29:37	@Espyo	...twice
2016-04-23 15:29:41	@Espyo	I fixed it, but then it came back somehow
2016-04-23 15:29:44	@Espyo	I think it's all fixed now
2016-04-23 15:29:57	@Espyo	but you'd deliver something to, say, the Blue Onion, and the Red Onion would be the one to spit seeds
2016-04-23 15:30:22	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlGWwaTEQ hm, this looks easy enough
2016-04-23 15:34:34	@Espyo	yep, easy
2016-04-23 15:34:40	@Espyo	just reproduced it, first try
2016-04-23 15:34:57	Marty2000	Good glitch
2016-04-23 15:35:13	@Espyo	but I'll try to reproduce the red glow one
2016-04-23 15:35:26	Marty2000	Pikmin 3 is now more glitched than the first Pikmin game, by the way
2016-04-23 15:35:39	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-04-23 15:35:42	@Espyo	it is much more complex
2016-04-23 15:35:45	@Espyo	a lot more can go wrong
2016-04-23 15:35:55	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-04-23 15:40:48	@Espyo	confirmed... it glows red
2016-04-23 15:41:05	@Espyo	are there any other levels where you have an Onion AND Whites/Purples?
2016-04-23 15:41:36	Marty2000	No
2016-04-23 15:41:47	@Espyo	wow
2016-04-23 15:41:51	@Espyo	I thought there would be
2016-04-23 15:41:55	@Espyo	well, guess I'll add the glitch then
2016-04-23 15:43:40	Marty2000	I really regret Whites and Purples are not in Story Mode, it's probably what disappointed me the most in P3
2016-04-23 15:43:51	@Espyo	I don't feel the same
2016-04-23 15:43:55	@Espyo	I'm glad they got new types
2016-04-23 15:44:02	@Espyo	but them not being there didn't really upset me
2016-04-23 15:44:07	@Espyo	for one thing, fun as Purples were, they were too cheap
2016-04-23 15:44:19	@Espyo	but then I understand they also wanted to keep things simple
2016-04-23 15:44:27	@Espyo	and swapping between 7 types of Pikmin is a nightmare
2016-04-23 15:44:37	@Espyo	hm, I just realized that on our Pikmin type articles, we don't have a list of levels they appear in
2016-04-23 15:44:42	Marty2000	Oh, I like the two new types too, but I would have liked to have them in the Story
2016-04-23 15:44:45	Marty2000	But I understand
2016-04-23 15:44:49	@Espyo	so if somebody wants to see White Pikmin in action in Pikmin 3, they don't have a list anywhere
2016-04-23 15:45:02	@Espyo	maybe if P3 had caves
2016-04-23 15:45:08	@Espyo	Purples and Whites could appear in some caves
2016-04-23 15:45:11	@Espyo	but couldn't come out, somehow
2016-04-23 15:45:12	@Espyo	like Bulbmin
2016-04-23 15:45:17	@Espyo	that'd be cool
2016-04-23 15:49:01	Marty2000	By the way, i think they removed the ground pound'ability to deal damages because Rocks can do something similar
2016-04-23 15:49:31	Marty2000	They are really similar to Purples in some ways...
2016-04-23 15:50:09	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-23 15:50:12	@Espyo	that's likely it
2016-04-23 15:50:30	@Espyo	I didn't realize Purples and Whites don't even appear in Battle Enemies! at all
2016-04-23 15:50:42	@Espyo	I guess they really wanted to make their strengths based on carrying alone
2016-04-23 15:50:57	@Espyo	Purples are kinda pointless in combat now, and White poison is so weak
2016-04-23 15:53:06	Marty2000	I understand for Purples, they were too strong in P2
2016-04-23 15:53:56	@Espyo	mhm
2016-04-23 15:55:00	@Espyo	I guess it also makes some sense to nerf the poison
2016-04-23 15:55:08	@Espyo	since it used to kill everything in one hit
2016-04-23 15:55:20	@Espyo	you sacrifice only a single Pikmin, and a huge enemy, like an Orange Bulborb, is instantly dead
2016-04-23 15:55:32	@Espyo	if you have to sacrifice three or four, that's a bit more strategic

2016-04-23 15:55:53	@Espyo	it's faster to kill the Bulborb that way, but do you want to risk 4 White Pikmin that could help carry back Nuggets?
2016-04-23 15:55:58	@Espyo	but just one? that's a bit too much
2016-04-23 15:58:13	Marty2000	The speed of Whites was also nerfed in P3, if I remember
2016-04-23 15:58:24	Marty2000	Whereas the speed of Purples was buffed

2016-04-23 16:04:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-23 16:07:31	Marty2000	In P2, a leaf white would go slightly faster than a bud Red/Yellow/Blue, and those would go slightly faster than a flower Purple, but "much" faster when carrying items. In P3, a flower Purple is faster than a leaf White, and the latter is faster than a bud Red/Blue/Yellow
2016-04-23 16:14:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-23 16:17:55	@Espyo	well, first match, and I'm paired with SpongeBobs

2016-04-23 18:18:15	Neocraftz1553	Nice! 
2016-04-23 18:18:50	Marty2000	By the way, I am not good at all at making images, so they will be very simple, but I think that's not so important
2016-04-23 18:19:42	Neocraftz1553	I COULD help once in a while
2016-04-23 18:20:21	Neocraftz1553	The thing is I'm juggling 2(or 3) fan games right now
2016-04-23 18:20:45	Marty2000	Oh, thanks but don't worry, that will be okay ;)

2016-04-23 18:54:53	Marty2000	Thanks, but it was... easy. I just used Paint for it. It's very simple but I think it looks cool, so I'll keep it
2016-04-23 18:55:08	Neocraftz1553	Maybe try putting it in an Arctic Enviroment for a "Gameplay Screenshot"
2016-04-23 18:55:23	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, I noticed

2016-04-23 19:31:46	@Espyo	the first 20 or so matches I got were mostly victories

2016-04-23 19:31:53	@Espyo	don't know what happened
2016-04-23 19:31:54	Neocraftz1553	on what?
2016-04-23 19:32:01	Marty2000	Neocraftz1553 : Splatoon
2016-04-23 19:32:02	@Espyo	further, almost ALL kills I got in the past 2 hours were trades
2016-04-23 19:32:08	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-04-23 19:32:14	@Espyo	that's just insanely frustrating
2016-04-23 19:32:15	Marty2000	I think my number of wins and losses are more or less the same
2016-04-23 19:32:28	Marty2000	Yes, it is
2016-04-23 19:32:39	Marty2000	The same also happened to me most of the time :/
2016-04-23 19:32:45	@Espyo	ugh
2016-04-23 19:32:48	@Espyo	there are so many ways to fix this
2016-04-23 19:32:55	@Espyo	if they made weapons take much longer to kill
2016-04-23 19:33:03	@Espyo	the damage would actually be calculated in a timely fashion
2016-04-23 19:33:14	@Espyo	instead of everybody being healthy one second and everybody eating a million points of damage in the next
2016-04-23 19:33:19	@Espyo	of course that makes everybody die all the time
2016-04-23 19:34:06	Marty2000	With the lag, it makes things horrible sometimes

2016-04-23 20:27:10	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-04-23 20:27:11	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-04-23 20:27:17	@PikFan	currently ranting about Splatfest
2016-04-23 20:27:28	Nvortex	impossible as in they are good or 
2016-04-23 20:27:29	Nvortex	oh 
2016-04-23 20:27:32	Nvortex	S+++++++++++
2016-04-23 20:27:34	Marty2000	Nvortex, look at this :

2016-04-23 20:28:10	@PikFan	but I also blame my own skills
2016-04-23 20:28:19	@PikFan	why can't I hold any ground of my own?
2016-04-23 20:28:23	@PikFan	why do I suck so bad?
2016-04-23 20:29:14	@PikFan	most of the players on Team Patrick are somehow able to outrange me, outmaneuver me, etc
2016-04-23 20:29:16	@PikFan	I
2016-04-23 20:29:17	@PikFan	judt
2016-04-23 20:29:19	@PikFan	don't
2016-04-23 20:29:20	@PikFan	get
2016-04-23 20:29:21	@PikFan	it
2016-04-23 20:29:30	@PikFan	*just
2016-04-23 20:29:48	Marty2000	Judging by my matches, the Spongebob team was better
2016-04-23 20:30:01	@PikFan	hm
2016-04-23 20:30:14	@PikFan	well, this always happens to me in Splatfests
2016-04-23 20:30:30	@PikFan	I'm always playing with people who are so much better than me
2016-04-23 20:30:50	Yoshi2	rule of thumb: your team is always terrible and the enemy team is always pro
2016-04-23 20:30:55	@Espyo	^
2016-04-23 20:30:57	@PikFan	yyyyyyyup
2016-04-23 20:31:17	@PikFan	I'm always terrible too
2016-04-23 20:31:34	Yoshi2	get better at carrying the team
2016-04-23 20:31:35	Nvortex	hello?
2016-04-23 20:31:36	@PikFan	my rank is S, for crying out loud
2016-04-23 20:31:42	@PikFan	and yet I still suck
2016-04-23 20:32:32	Nvortex	what the hell
2016-04-23 20:32:32	@PikFan	it's been nearly 4 months since I got the game
2016-04-23 20:32:40	Nvortex	i ddint know it was possible to have lag here
2016-04-23 20:32:47	@PikFan	I mean, I guess I'm okay
2016-04-23 20:32:55	@PikFan	but I'm just not pro
2016-04-23 20:33:15	@PikFan	...Splatfests always make me very salty and self-depreciating
2016-04-23 20:33:21	@Espyo	here's what you have to understand:
2016-04-23 20:33:23	Marty2000	I am S+ but I haven't played fomths+-* I'd probably rank down fast. I'd like to play in Squad Battles
2016-04-23 20:33:25	@Espyo	no matter how good you are
2016-04-23 20:33:28	@Espyo	your team will always drag you down
2016-04-23 20:33:34	@Espyo	lag will always remove any factor of skill
2016-04-23 20:33:38	Marty2000	Espyo's right
2016-04-23 20:33:48	Marty2000	for months*
2016-04-23 20:33:53	@PikFan	I actually haven't had any lag issues
2016-04-23 20:33:54	@Espyo	and there are players out there who drink melted Splatoon CDs for breakfast as power juices, every day
2016-04-23 20:33:59	@Espyo	there's ALWAYS lag
2016-04-23 20:34:03	@Espyo	actually, literally
2016-04-23 20:34:19	@Espyo	there is always some delay between the signals coming and going, that's mandatorily larger than 0
2016-04-23 20:34:23	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-04-23 20:34:35	@Espyo	but Splatoon just handles it so poorly that even if there's only a little, it will have an impact
2016-04-23 20:34:46	@PikFan	but I mean, I haven't run into any crazy lag where there's players teleporting around
2016-04-23 20:35:21	@Espyo	just focus on playing for the sake of playing
2016-04-23 20:35:27	@Espyo	don't play to win
2016-04-23 20:35:30	@Espyo	the game punishes victories
2016-04-23 20:35:32	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-23 20:35:47	@PikFan	punishes victories? first I've heard of that
2016-04-23 20:36:10	@Espyo	punishes playing for victories, anyway
2016-04-23 20:36:16	@Espyo	you try to actually go and battle somebody?
2016-04-23 20:36:24	@Espyo	you end up losing, even if your equipment and skill is better
2016-04-23 20:36:48	@Espyo	remember, it's a Nintendo game
2016-04-23 20:36:52	@PikFan	well, I wouldn't mind Splatfest battles
2016-04-23 20:36:56	@Espyo	there is no victory as much as Mario Party has victory
2016-04-23 20:37:03	@PikFan	...if I wasn't always being splatted in the face
2016-04-23 20:37:08	@PikFan	every single match
2016-04-23 20:37:10	@Espyo	uh, I think I didn't word that right, but you get me
2016-04-23 20:37:15	@PikFan	heh
2016-04-23 20:37:20	@Espyo	that's why I'm starting to main the Inkbrush a lot more
2016-04-23 20:37:27	@Espyo	it gives me a lot of mobility and inkability
2016-04-23 20:37:30	@Espyo	and very little combat power
2016-04-23 20:37:37	@Espyo	to FORCE me to run away from combat like a coward
2016-04-23 20:37:37	@PikFan	you can't really have fun if the moment you leave your spawn — SPLAT
2016-04-23 20:37:43	@Espyo	because it's the ONLY way to have fun in the game
2016-04-23 20:38:09	@PikFan	hmmm
2016-04-23 20:38:17	@Espyo	somebody's coming at me to attack? I can forward to, set up the terrain in front of me so I can hide and evade easily, find some tactical spots to gain advantage
2016-04-23 20:38:17	@PikFan	should I try avoiding combat more?
2016-04-23 20:38:28	@Espyo	and then end up dying in two hits, and the enemy not dying in 6 because the game says so
2016-04-23 20:38:33	@Espyo	or I can just RUN AWAY
2016-04-23 20:38:36	@Espyo	you should
2016-04-23 20:38:45	@Espyo	combat almost always ends in a trade
2016-04-23 20:38:51	@Espyo	meaning two people spend the next 10 seconds not playing the game
2016-04-23 20:39:04	@Espyo	who cares about the opponent, but when you spend the next 10 seconds not playing
2016-04-23 20:39:06	@Espyo	I guess that's a bad thing
2016-04-23 20:39:12	@Espyo	only go for a kill when you know you've got it
2016-04-23 20:39:18	@Espyo	and even then, if it's too far out of the way, just focus on inking
2016-04-23 20:39:26	@Espyo	you can also try to hide and then OH-KO people with a roller or something
2016-04-23 20:39:29	@Espyo	that's very fun and relaxing
2016-04-23 20:39:33	@PikFan	what if someone's coming after me?
2016-04-23 20:39:40	@Espyo	but other than that
2016-04-23 20:39:43	@Espyo	run if possible, outsmart them
2016-04-23 20:39:46	Marty2000	Who uses motion controls here?
2016-04-23 20:39:47	@Espyo	if you're a cornered rat, then attack
2016-04-23 20:39:49	@Espyo	I do
2016-04-23 20:39:49	@PikFan	I do
2016-04-23 20:39:59	@PikFan	uhm
2016-04-23 20:40:02	Marty2000	I don't
2016-04-23 20:40:14	@PikFan	wait, what level are you
2016-04-23 20:40:21	Marty2000	50
2016-04-23 20:40:24	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-23 20:40:31	@PikFan	50 and you use sticks?
2016-04-23 20:40:36	@PikFan	that's pretty impressive
2016-04-23 20:40:44	Marty2000	Motion Controls are better, that's true
2016-04-23 20:41:04	Marty2000	But I prefer sticks
2016-04-23 20:41:10	@PikFan	then again, I heard somewhere that the first person to reach S+99 used sticks
2016-04-23 20:41:16	Marty2000	I'm quite ill-at-ease with motion controls
2016-04-23 20:41:22	@PikFan	probably not true, but that's a bold claim
2016-04-23 20:41:23	@Espyo	it takes getting used to
2016-04-23 20:41:47	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-23 20:42:04	@Espyo	what annoys me isn't that most of the time I lose a combat, it's because my aim was worse, or my weapon was weaker, or the ground next to me was covered in too much enemy ink, which increased my damage
2016-04-23 20:42:16	@Espyo	what irks me is time and time again, I specifically see the number of hits both players cause
2016-04-23 20:42:23	@Espyo	and I always die in 2 or 3 hits
2016-04-23 20:42:27	@Espyo	and the opponents always take over 5
2016-04-23 20:42:29	@Espyo	regardless of weapon
2016-04-23 20:42:37	@Espyo	these aren't just a "it SEEMS wrong"
2016-04-23 20:42:43	@Espyo	these are objective, quantifiable numbers
2016-04-23 20:42:48	Marty2000	Same, that's very bothersome. No matter how many hits the enemy takes, it doesn't die
2016-04-23 20:42:56	@Espyo	anybody could come at me and say that I just suck, and that I'm biased to find some reason for my performance
2016-04-23 20:43:01	@Espyo	but nope, numbers are objective
2016-04-23 20:43:11	@Espyo	it COULD be a matter of lag, which it sometimes is
2016-04-23 20:43:19	@Espyo	you pump somebody full of damage, but they kill you first
2016-04-23 20:43:21	@Espyo	but die later anyway
2016-04-23 20:43:23	@Espyo	that's lag
2016-04-23 20:43:28	@Espyo	it sucks, but there's at least SOME reason
2016-04-23 20:43:46	@Espyo	but hitting somebody with 10 hits, and nothing happening to them
2016-04-23 20:43:47	@Espyo	ugh
2016-04-23 20:43:54	@PikFan	and Nintendo can't be bothered to fix it because they don't understand the internet
2016-04-23 20:44:02	@Espyo	and I honestly would like to know what's up on the other person's screen

2016-04-23 20:44:16	@Espyo	do they see the same? me being shot with 10 shots, and me only hitting them once?
2016-04-23 20:44:19	En_Passant	hi
2016-04-23 20:44:19	Marty2000	Hello
2016-04-23 20:44:22	Scruffy	Hi En_Passant!
2016-04-23 20:44:27	@Espyo	or do they see the same number of shots on both sides that I do?
2016-04-23 20:44:33	@Espyo	do they see me standing still on their end?
2016-04-23 20:44:37	En_Passant	Shooting is bad
2016-04-23 20:44:41	@Espyo	yes
2016-04-23 20:44:46	En_Passant	Why are we shooting
2016-04-23 20:44:53	@PikFan	Splatoon
2016-04-23 20:44:55	Marty2000	Because we're squids
2016-04-23 20:45:01	@PikFan	no
2016-04-23 20:45:02	En_Passant	ah
2016-04-23 20:45:02	@PikFan	we're kids
2016-04-23 20:45:04	@PikFan	get it right
2016-04-23 20:45:09	En_Passant	you're both
2016-04-23 20:45:13	Marty2000	No, we're skids
2016-04-23 20:45:39	@PikFan	actually, I'm an Octoling ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2016-04-23 20:46:26	Marty2000	Espyo, could you try the Kelp Splatterscope?
2016-04-23 20:48:16	@Espyo	I tried for a bit
2016-04-23 20:48:25	@Espyo	it takes a bit of getting used to if you're so used to the normal Splatterscope
2016-04-23 20:48:33	@Espyo	plus I REALLY miss my grenades :/
2016-04-23 20:48:39	@Espyo	but I can see it being better on some maps
2016-04-23 20:49:25	Marty2000	Yes, it's quite different, I'd recommend to use it on vast maps
2016-04-23 20:49:39	Marty2000	With the Killer Wail
2016-04-23 20:50:52	@Espyo	right

2016-04-23 20:53:48	@PikFan	hopefully I don't get annihilated
2016-04-23 20:54:02	Marty2000	What Splatfest rank are you, PikDan?
2016-04-23 20:54:07	Marty2000	PikFan*
2016-04-23 20:54:28	@PikFan	rank? you mean title, or power?
2016-04-23 20:54:34	Marty2000	Title, yes
2016-04-23 20:54:39	@PikFan	fiend
2016-04-23 20:54:45	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-23 20:57:52	@PikFan	I was annihilated
2016-04-23 20:58:30	@PikFan	getting the royalty title will be excruciating
2016-04-23 20:58:50	Marty2000	I wish we could join friends during Splatfests :/
2016-04-23 20:59:01	@PikFan	so, my Splatfest Power started out at 1600
2016-04-23 20:59:07	@PikFan	now it's at 1578
2016-04-23 20:59:12	Yoshi2	but then you'd absolutely wreck the enemy team
2016-04-23 20:59:19	Yoshi2	unless there was team match making
2016-04-23 20:59:37	Marty2000	True
2016-04-23 20:59:57	@PikFan	oh, so this one guy killed me in two shots
2016-04-23 21:00:03	@PikFan	even though I hit him four tmes
2016-04-23 21:00:05	@PikFan	*times
2016-04-23 21:00:12	@PikFan	yup, I know how you feel now, Espyo

2016-04-23 21:19:15	@PikFan	the way Creative spells "canon" bothers me
2016-04-23 21:24:34	En_Passant	He also misspells my name once :/
2016-04-23 21:24:47	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-04-23 21:24:59	@PikFan	by the way, how come you never posted on the forums before this?
2016-04-23 21:29:31	En_Passant	Not much to really add to, I guess
2016-04-23 21:30:12	@PikFan	you sure about that?
2016-04-23 21:30:31	@PikFan	well, I guess if that's how you feel...
2016-04-23 21:33:54	En_Passant	What? There aren't a lot of subforums that I have anything to say about
2016-04-23 21:34:45	@PikFan	hmm
2016-04-23 21:34:46	Yoshi2	I don't use forums that much nowadays
2016-04-23 21:35:10	@PikFan	well, okay
2016-04-23 21:35:34	Yoshi2	mostly because most stuff I'd like to do can be done over chat
2016-04-23 21:35:57	Yoshi2	though forums are more permanent, so better suited for some content
2016-04-23 21:36:00	@PikFan	I'd go with that logic, except most of the forum users avoid IRC
2016-04-23 21:36:58	@PikFan	also, I try to participate in all discussions, because I like talking to other Pikmin fans
2016-04-23 21:37:58	Yoshi2	if there are some people interested in reverse-engineering pikmin data, I'd join the forum ASAP
2016-04-23 21:38:28	En_Passant	Most of the discussion is people wishlisting tbh
2016-04-23 21:39:37	@PikFan	what's wrong with that?
2016-04-23 21:40:07	@PikFan	and it doesn't seem like most of the discussion to me
2016-04-23 21:41:35	En_Passant	Sorry, it's either wishlisting or wild theories
2016-04-23 21:42:19	En_Passant	Neither of those generate real discussion, because there's no sound basis to the ideas worth taking about
2016-04-23 21:42:47	Nvortex	then why don't you try making a good thread
2016-04-23 21:42:56	@PikFan	that sounds pretty elitist imo
2016-04-23 21:43:18	En_Passant	Probably. That's why I don't go there
2016-04-23 21:46:07	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-04-23 21:47:16	@PikFan	I don't like pointless small talk, but the forum doesn't feel that way to me
2016-04-23 21:47:24	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2016-04-23 21:48:21	 *	Yoshi2 highfives En_Passant 
2016-04-23 21:48:27	Yoshi2	we should make a club for elite people
2016-04-23 21:48:37	En_Passant	lol
2016-04-23 21:48:45	En_Passant	We can call it the Tautology Club
2016-04-23 21:49:03	En_Passant	No one will ever guess what it's for
2016-04-23 21:49:10	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-04-23 21:52:24	@PikFan	!def tautology
2016-04-23 21:52:24	M6	Needless repetition of an idea, especially in words other than those of the immediate context, without imparting additional force or clearness, as in “widow woman.”.

2016-04-23 23:41:02	Nvortex	what is it going to be about
2016-04-23 23:42:48	Marty2000	Probably in several parts (like Pikmin 2). I thought of another debt and then, rivalries.. or other histories. This is vague  but I'm currently working on it

2016-04-23 23:45:34	Marty2000	Anyway, if a part of my history was similar to Pikmin 2 (debt), I would still add other histories, otherwise it would be a remake of Pikmin 2. I can use this http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Marty/Decoration to include new treasures

2016-04-23 23:56:00	@PikFan	heh, it's okay
2016-04-23 23:56:35	Marty2000	Probably because history and story are "histoire" in my language... there's no difference

2016-04-23 23:59:57	@PikFan	one thing about Japanese though
2016-04-24 00:00:11	@PikFan	in English, when we see someone, we often say, "How are you?"
2016-04-24 00:00:21	@PikFan	in Japanese, there's no such thing
2016-04-24 00:00:41	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-04-24 00:00:41	En_Passant	They know it's a formality
2016-04-24 00:00:47	Marty2000	Isn't there the equivalent "genki desu ka"?
2016-04-24 00:00:58	Marty2000	Oh okay
2016-04-24 00:00:59	@PikFan	the closest thing you can say is "O genki desu ka?" but you only use that when you haven't seen someone in a long time
2016-04-24 00:01:12	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-24 00:01:27	Neocraftz1553	Wait a day, then say it
2016-04-24 00:01:37	@PikFan	no
2016-04-24 00:01:44	@PikFan	by long time, I mean weeks, months

2016-04-24 00:02:08	Marty2000	I wonder why some Japanese friends ask  me "genki desu ka" each time I meet them in Animal Corssing, then
2016-04-24 00:02:08	@PikFan	not for the Japanese it's not
2016-04-24 00:02:13	Neocraftz1553	then again...

2016-04-24 00:02:32	@PikFan	oh hmm

2016-04-24 00:24:55	Marty2000	come from the Gamecube version?
2016-04-24 00:25:58	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-24 00:26:03	Nvortex	it's pikmin 1
2016-04-24 00:26:37	Marty2000	Yes, But I was wondering if this is an artwork from the Gamecube version only or for both the Gamecube and NPC! versions
2016-04-24 00:26:40	Neocraftz1553	Whaaaaaaaaaat?
2016-04-24 00:27:00	Neocraftz1553	That image is awsome
2016-04-24 00:27:26	Marty2000	They slightly changed it in the NPC! version
2016-04-24 00:27:32	Marty2000	Wait, i'll upload it to Pasteboard

2016-04-24 00:28:40	Marty2000	In the manual of the NPC! version, the color of the Pikmin is red
2016-04-24 00:29:40	Nvortex	interesting
2016-04-24 00:29:54	Neocraftz1553	maybe not to spoil the other colors....?
2016-04-24 00:30:05	Marty2000	Maybe
2016-04-24 00:30:17	Neocraftz1553	Or maybe because the Red Pikmin is the first one found...

2016-04-24 00:34:44	Marty2000	:-)
2016-04-24 00:34:47	Neocraftz1553	Spread them around the areas walls
2016-04-24 00:34:53	Neocraftz1553	instant troll
2016-04-24 00:34:55	Marty2000	And enjoy!
2016-04-24 00:35:25	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-24 00:35:52	Neocraftz1553	Even better....
2016-04-24 00:36:13	Neocraftz1553	set there health to 500000
2016-04-24 00:36:35	Neocraftz1553	and delete the code that makes them die when Pikmin land on it from its Script
2016-04-24 00:37:02	Neocraftz1553	Oh hey, Espyo
2016-04-24 00:37:17	@Espyo	hm?
2016-04-24 00:37:30	Neocraftz1553	isn't it possible to make a Dwarf Orange never go back "home"
2016-04-24 00:37:37	@Espyo	well yeah
2016-04-24 00:37:39	Neocraftz1553	that way it wanders around the map
2016-04-24 00:37:55	Neocraftz1553	remove the "go home" command?
2016-04-24 00:38:10	Neocraftz1553	not really commands, but...
2016-04-24 00:38:38	Neocraftz1553	ah, the returning Script
2016-04-24 00:38:54	Neocraftz1553	and returning_ignoring
2016-04-24 00:39:21	Neocraftz1553	then remove the instances from the other Scripts
2016-04-24 00:40:07	Neocraftz1553	or...
2016-04-24 00:41:02	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-24 00:41:19	Neocraftz1553	change it into move = randomly? 
2016-04-24 00:41:35	@Espyo	there's only one thing that makes it return home
2016-04-24 00:41:40	@Espyo	and that's when it gets too far away from its home
2016-04-24 00:41:42	@Espyo	just remove that event
2016-04-24 00:41:50	@Espyo	it should appear more than once
2016-04-24 00:41:56	@Espyo	search for on_far_from_home
2016-04-24 00:41:58	@Espyo	or something like that
2016-04-24 00:42:11	Neocraftz1553	ah, ok
2016-04-24 00:42:17	Neocraftz1553	just remove that?
2016-04-24 00:43:10	Neocraftz1553	If you change it into move = randomly, it'll look like a confused idiot who's lost it's way home
2016-04-24 00:43:17	Neocraftz1553	or does it...
2016-04-24 00:43:24	Neocraftz1553	lets do it, for science
2016-04-24 00:46:08	@Espyo	it shouldn't do anything
2016-04-24 00:46:34	Neocraftz1553	it still returns, more or less
2016-04-24 00:47:51	Neocraftz1553	Theres only two occurrences of on_far_from_home
2016-04-24 00:48:07	Neocraftz1553	making the job somewhat easier for people with normal notepad...
2016-04-24 00:49:40	@Espyo	what statuses are they on?
2016-04-24 00:49:45	@Espyo	oh, probably chasing enemy
2016-04-24 00:50:15	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-24 00:50:26	@Espyo	when the Bulborb is chasing an enemy
2016-04-24 00:50:33	@Espyo	that's where it is also checking if it's too far from home
2016-04-24 00:50:37	Neocraftz1553	oh, I just deleted far from home
2016-04-24 00:50:42	Neocraftz1553	it works fine
2016-04-24 00:50:46	Neocraftz1553	I think
2016-04-24 00:50:53	@Espyo	check Error_log.txt
2016-04-24 00:50:56	@Espyo	to see if it gave some error
2016-04-24 00:51:19	Neocraftz1553	I made a giant stretch of land with mazes and such to see if it works
2016-04-24 00:51:41	Neocraftz1553	No, no error
2016-04-24 00:51:58	Neocraftz1553	(a bunch of errors from TD, though :|)
2016-04-24 00:52:10	@Espyo	TD?
2016-04-24 00:52:18	Neocraftz1553	Test Dweevil
2016-04-24 00:52:21	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-24 00:53:00	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-24 00:53:16	Neocraftz1553	Test Dweevil has given me quite a hard time
2016-04-24 00:53:34	Neocraftz1553	the Script is based off more or less of the Dwarf Reds
2016-04-24 00:53:45	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-24 00:53:46	Neocraftz1553	So are some of the animations
2016-04-24 00:53:49	@Espyo	have you followed the tutorial at all?
2016-04-24 00:54:15	@Espyo	just asking
2016-04-24 00:54:28	Neocraftz1553	no...
2016-04-24 00:54:33	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-24 00:54:42	@Espyo	well, is there any part in particular you're having trouble with?
2016-04-24 00:54:47	Neocraftz1553	I'll check it out today, promise
2016-04-24 00:54:58	Neocraftz1553	not any in particular
2016-04-24 00:55:08	@Espyo	just the general idea?
2016-04-24 00:55:13	Neocraftz1553	Just making the graphics...
2016-04-24 00:55:25	Neocraftz1553	everything else is fine...
2016-04-24 00:55:26	@Espyo	the graphics are tough, but they're the least engine-related thing out there
2016-04-24 00:55:29	@Espyo	nothing I can do to make it easier
2016-04-24 00:55:36	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-24 00:55:48	@Espyo	gonna head off now
2016-04-24 00:55:49	@Espyo	night
2016-04-24 00:55:55	Neocraftz1553	ah ok, night

2016-04-24 00:56:09	Marty2000	Good night
2016-04-24 00:56:10	Neocraftz1553	hm...
2016-04-24 00:56:15	Neocraftz1553	Espyo, can you
2016-04-24 00:56:17	Marty2000	Espyo
2016-04-24 00:56:21	Neocraftz1553	eh, too late
2016-04-24 00:56:27	Marty2000	Too late
2016-04-24 00:56:29	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-24 00:56:35	Neocraftz1553	I'll wait till tommarrow
2016-04-24 00:56:42	Neocraftz1553	its all worth it
2016-04-24 00:57:05	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-04-24 00:57:15	Neocraftz1553	so, while we were talking...
2016-04-24 00:57:33	Neocraftz1553	I led the Dwarf orange to the landing site...
2016-04-24 00:57:45	Neocraftz1553	and it milled around there for a while
2016-04-24 00:57:47	Marty2000	I should try the engine one day, it looks great
2016-04-24 00:57:47	Neocraftz1553	...
2016-04-24 00:57:52	Marty2000	Oh
2016-04-24 00:57:55	Neocraftz1553	somewhere down the line.,,
2016-04-24 00:58:07	Neocraftz1553	it "killed" captain Olimar
2016-04-24 00:58:20	Neocraftz1553	Captain deaths aren't implemented yet
2016-04-24 00:58:29	Neocraftz1553	so Olimar was still there
2016-04-24 00:58:43	Neocraftz1553	and I saw the Dwarf Orange go near the Pikmin
2016-04-24 00:59:03	Neocraftz1553	I tried to save them, but the Dwarf took out Olimar first :p
2016-04-24 00:59:18	Neocraftz1553	so I had to just stand there while they all go devoured
2016-04-24 00:59:27	Marty2000	:/
2016-04-24 00:59:31	Neocraftz1553	but hey, the enemy works ^.^
2016-04-24 00:59:56	Marty2000	Yep, that's cool you can make it go all around without boundaries!
2016-04-24 01:00:09	Neocraftz1553	Yep!
2016-04-24 01:01:05	Neocraftz1553	Espyo should try to implement a piece of code where if they encounter a "Blocking" type sector, the entities will walk away from it
2016-04-24 01:01:30	Neocraftz1553	even better, if they encounter an edge
2016-04-24 01:01:49	Marty2000	Do they die when falling?
2016-04-24 01:02:00	Neocraftz1553	That way Objects won't get stuck 
2016-04-24 01:02:00	Neocraftz1553	No
2016-04-24 01:02:04	Neocraftz1553	No fall damage 
2016-04-24 01:02:41	Marty2000	So there's a respawn system? Can they fall, for example, in an abyss and respawn?
2016-04-24 01:07:00	Neocraftz1553	Unless you make a bottomless pit
2016-04-24 01:07:01	Neocraftz1553	then they ALL die
2016-04-24 01:07:01	Neocraftz1553	ooh. captains
2016-04-24 01:07:36	Neocraftz1553	yes, captains resprawn
2016-04-24 01:07:37	Neocraftz1553	enemies and any other entity don't 
2016-04-24 01:07:52	Neocraftz1553	unless they don't have the "delete on bottomless pit" Script
2016-04-24 01:08:26	Neocraftz1553	Objects like treasures and stuff...
2016-04-24 01:08:49	Neocraftz1553	not sure if they get deleted, or just stay there in the pit, mushing away for all eternity
2016-04-24 01:09:03	Neocraftz1553	but its a nuisence if they stay there
2016-04-24 01:09:18	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin willtry to pick the items up
2016-04-24 01:09:32	Neocraftz1553	they will most likely die
2016-04-24 01:11:07	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-04-24 01:11:14	Neocraftz1553	I lost my mouses wireless chip..
2016-04-24 01:11:32	Neocraftz1553	so now I am looking for a wired mouse :|
2016-04-24 01:12:26	Marty2000	Ok, thanks
2016-04-24 01:12:42	Marty2000	It reminds me of the new system in Pikmin 3...
2016-04-24 01:13:05	En_Passant	That system isn't fair
2016-04-24 01:13:09	En_Passant	Pikmin die but not enemies
2016-04-24 01:13:20	Marty2000	Pikmin die, Leaders take lots of damages, and enemies just respawn normally :/
2016-04-24 01:13:27	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-24 01:15:57	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-04-24 01:16:29	Neocraftz1553	Is Clockwork Chasm the only bottomless pit area?
2016-04-24 01:17:15	Marty2000	There are others, in Bingo Battle
2016-04-24 01:17:18	En_Passant	Rusted Labyrinth and Corroded Maze as well
2016-04-24 01:17:33	Marty2000	^
2016-04-24 01:17:36	Neocraftz1553	links, please?
2016-04-24 01:17:53	Neocraftz1553	Bottomless Pits fascinate me in the Pikmin series
2016-04-24 01:18:06	Neocraftz1553	you can kill Pikmin and keep on killing :p
2016-04-24 01:18:18	En_Passant	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Rusted_Labyrinth
2016-04-24 01:18:25	En_Passant	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Corroded_Maze
2016-04-24 01:18:30	Neocraftz1553	thanks much
2016-04-24 01:19:29	Neocraftz1553	man I wish I had P3 :|
2016-04-24 01:19:45	Neocraftz1553	But now I think I'll wait for P4
2016-04-24 01:20:17	Neocraftz1553	I wonder if Nintendo will keep on going with these series...
2016-04-24 01:20:44	Neocraftz1553	If they add new characters, they can keep it going till P7 or something like that
2016-04-24 01:20:49	Neocraftz1553	hmm...

2016-04-24 02:38:32	Marty2000	Hi UltraMario
2016-04-24 02:39:38	UltraMario	hi
2016-04-24 02:39:45	Marty2000	Well, I think I've got a little story for my fan-game, but I'll have to modify it a little, it's quite messy...
2016-04-24 02:39:49	UltraMario	hey Marty2000, do you have a discord account?
2016-04-24 02:40:01	Marty2000	I don't
2016-04-24 02:40:06	Marty2000	Sorry :/

2016-04-24 02:40:48	UltraMario	that's fine

2016-04-24 02:40:58	Marty2000	Oh
2016-04-24 02:41:04	Neocraftz1553	It still needs some work, though, but I'm liking it so far
2016-04-24 02:41:05	Marty2000	What is it about?
2016-04-24 02:41:15	Marty2000	UltraMario : okay
2016-04-24 02:41:27	Neocraftz1553	a company on fanon is a group of people that work together to make one fangame

2016-04-24 06:10:35	ScruffyChat	Does anyone need that image anymore?
2016-04-24 06:10:42	ScruffyChat	Or can I delete it/
2016-04-24 06:10:53	Neocraftz1553	not sure, but leave it on there
2016-04-24 06:11:02	Neocraftz1553	the people at fanon might need it later on
2016-04-24 06:11:54	ScruffyChat	If you search "wii u box template" it's the first image to come up
2016-04-24 06:12:06	ScruffyChat	It seems more convoluted to come to me about it
2016-04-24 06:12:31	Neocraftz1553	derr
2016-04-24 06:12:53	Neocraftz1553	but I downloaded more than 5, and they don't have transparency
2016-04-24 06:13:10	ScruffyChat	that's odd
2016-04-24 06:13:16	ScruffyChat	the first image has transparency
2016-04-24 06:13:27	ScruffyChat	did you filter the search to transparent images?
2016-04-24 06:13:39	Neocraftz1553	hm.. no
2016-04-24 06:13:58	ScruffyChat	Also it's easy to layer something behind a non-transparent image since it would be all-white or all-black space
2016-04-24 06:14:19	ScruffyChat	with a photo editor like Photoshop or GIMPL

2016-04-24 14:27:28	Marty2000	Hey, Espyo. I have got a question. I want to create my article on the Pikmin Fanon. Though, my fangame is not finished yet. I already have things like the story (that I will probably modify because it's quite messy), new enemies (images), Pikmin (images), areas... is it enough to start making the article?  Or does the game need finishing?
2016-04-24 14:27:52	@Espyo	I'm not that into Fanon's guidelines
2016-04-24 14:27:55	@Espyo	but I'm pretty sure you can make it
2016-04-24 14:28:05	@Espyo	there are so many games, enemies, etc. that are on the wiki without being finished
2016-04-24 14:28:06	@Espyo	so don't worry
2016-04-24 14:28:11	Marty2000	Well, okay. Thanks. 
2016-04-24 14:28:33	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Digging&curid=18614&diff=162878&oldid=162175
2016-04-24 14:28:40	@Espyo	doesn't this only happen if you use the C-stick?
2016-04-24 14:28:56	@Espyo	like, if they're in your party and you just walk over a buried treasure, I'm pretty sure they'll ignore it
2016-04-24 14:29:09	Marty2000	No, White Pikmin won't ignore it (at least in NPC!2)
2016-04-24 14:29:18	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-24 14:29:22	@Espyo	seems to be an NPC! difference then
2016-04-24 14:29:26	@Espyo	I'll double check on the GameCube
2016-04-24 14:29:31	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-24 14:34:20	@Espyo	oh... I see
2016-04-24 14:34:26	@Espyo	they also automatically dig on the GameCube
2016-04-24 14:34:30	@Espyo	hm, but it's really precise
2016-04-24 14:34:36	@Espyo	they really have to be on top of the object
2016-04-24 14:34:44	Marty2000	Yes, they need to get very close
2016-04-24 14:35:33	Marty2000	I think this mechanic was made to help the player find buried treasures more easily (since other Pikmin types cannot instantly dig)
2016-04-24 14:36:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-24 14:41:49	@Espyo	Marty, I'm not so sure about adding the "classic" and "new" looks to infoboxes of enemies that barely change
2016-04-24 14:42:02	@Espyo	the purpose of adding the old and new to other enemies was because they changed a lot
2016-04-24 14:42:08	@Espyo	like the Iridescent Flint Beetle
2016-04-24 14:42:34	@Espyo	so that people who come into the wiki see the image on the infobox, and if they don't recognize it, they can just change to a different look, and they'll be able to see what the enemy is in that version
2016-04-24 14:42:48	@Espyo	but for something like a Female Sheargrub , it's the same
2016-04-24 14:45:34	Marty2000	Yes, that's true
2016-04-24 14:45:46	@Espyo	I don't know if we should keep it...
2016-04-24 14:45:55	@Espyo	we could probably use other people's opinions
2016-04-24 14:46:04	Marty2000	I could see very tiny differences but if they are too small to be added, they can be removed. If I recall well, I left something about that
2016-04-24 14:46:07	Marty2000	I wasn't so sure
2016-04-24 14:47:22	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Nectarous_Dandelfly&curid=9575&diff=162971&oldid=160361 does a health wheel appear if a Winged Pikmin damages it?
2016-04-24 14:48:13	Marty2000	No
2016-04-24 14:48:27	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-24 14:48:36	@Espyo	it's like it uses its own method of damage calculation or something...
2016-04-24 14:48:41	Marty2000	But it takes three hit for a Winged to "deafeat" it
2016-04-24 14:48:46	Marty2000	defeat*
2016-04-24 14:48:53	Marty2000	hits*
2016-04-24 14:48:53	@Espyo	right, so at least the HP does add up
2016-04-24 14:48:57	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-24 14:49:02	@Espyo	well, I'll remove the N/A then
2016-04-24 14:49:53	Marty2000	Maybe it works like a Dwarf Bulborb : it instantly dies when a Pikmin is thrown
2016-04-24 14:50:30	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-24 14:50:41	@Espyo	but it should show a health wheel regardless, when a non-thrown Winged attacks...
2016-04-24 14:51:01	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-24 15:07:09	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Larva_p2.jpg why did you call this "larva"? :|
2016-04-24 15:07:31	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-04-24 15:07:35	@Espyo	Armored Cannon Beetle Larva
2016-04-24 15:07:54	Marty2000	Oh, I forgot to modify the file's name
2016-04-24 15:08:22	@Espyo	hm, also, the [[Boulder]] article is not about the rocks shot by the lithopods
2016-04-24 15:08:23	Testyo	"Boulder" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Boulder
2016-04-24 15:08:26	@Espyo	only about the rocks that fall from the sky
2016-04-24 15:08:29	Marty2000	I tend to give names like that before uploading to Pikipedia. Sorry, lol 
2016-04-24 15:08:44	Marty2000	Oh, yes
2016-04-24 15:08:49	@Espyo	heh
2016-04-24 15:09:16	Marty2000	Well then, I guess the template and the image should be removed
2016-04-24 15:09:27	@Espyo	will do
2016-04-24 15:09:47	Marty2000	Thanks.

2016-04-24 15:17:37	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-24 15:21:39	Marty2000	We talked about these with Neo yesterday. I wondered if the artwork with the Blue Pikmin was from the Gamecube version
2016-04-24 15:22:19	@Espyo	maybe
2016-04-24 15:22:23	@Espyo	where does the Red Pikmin one come from?
2016-04-24 15:22:26	@Espyo	the NPC manual?
2016-04-24 15:23:07	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-24 15:23:15	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-24 15:23:18	@Espyo	well, okay
2016-04-24 15:23:20	Marty2000	Wait, I wonder if they modified other artworks
2016-04-24 15:23:24	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-04-24 15:23:55	@Espyo	oh, all of what we just talked about is already pointed out on your edit on the Olimar article
2016-04-24 15:23:57	@Espyo	sorry, didn't notice
2016-04-24 15:24:01	Marty2000	Neo suggested that the artwork were modified to avoid spoiling the Blue Pikmin
2016-04-24 15:24:14	@Espyo	yeah, good point
2016-04-24 15:24:26	@Espyo	but the manual already does explain Blue Pikmin abilities, so...
2016-04-24 15:24:57	Marty2000	Yes, that's strange
2016-04-24 15:25:05	Marty2000	And the cover has Blue Pikmin
2016-04-24 15:25:28	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-24 15:25:38	@Espyo	it might've changed because Red are more... "important"
2016-04-24 15:25:47	@Espyo	but even still it's a weak reason
2016-04-24 15:25:51	@Espyo	Nintendo is weird
2016-04-24 15:27:10	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/a/a2/Olimar_walking.jpg
2016-04-24 15:27:19	Marty2000	This one has a Yellow Pikmin in the NPC version
2016-04-24 15:27:31	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-24 15:27:35	Marty2000	Wait
2016-04-24 15:28:42	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/16/1461508111-yellow.jpg
2016-04-24 15:29:14	@Espyo	wow
2016-04-24 15:29:16	@Espyo	that's so jarring
2016-04-24 15:29:19	@Espyo	the styles don't even match
2016-04-24 15:29:35	@Espyo	but I guess it's not really trying to be a single piece of artwork as it is trying to be two pieces put next to one another
2016-04-24 15:29:44	@Espyo	unlike the Red Pikmin pluck, which is a straight edit
2016-04-24 15:29:56	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-24 15:30:00	Marty2000	I'm checking the others
2016-04-24 15:30:21	Marty2000	Is there a category on Pikipedia will all gamecube artworks?
2016-04-24 15:30:29	@Espyo	only [[Category:Concept art]]
2016-04-24 15:30:30	Testyo	"Category:Concept_art" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Concept_art
2016-04-24 15:30:37	@Espyo	but that has GC and Wii mixed
2016-04-24 15:30:44	@Espyo	also P3 ones
2016-04-24 15:30:45	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-24 15:30:46	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-04-24 15:30:57	@Espyo	quick thing:
2016-04-24 15:31:00	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Toady_Bloyster&curid=1552&diff=162516&oldid=161718 how did you get this info?
2016-04-24 15:31:39	Marty2000	Punching with a leader (each hit = 3 HP)
2016-04-24 15:31:47	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-24 15:31:55	@Espyo	that must've taken a while
2016-04-24 15:32:06	@Espyo	what made you decide to go to that specific enemy and count its HP?
2016-04-24 15:32:07	Marty2000	Oh, not so much to be honest
2016-04-24 15:32:17	Marty2000	1min 20 if I remember
2016-04-24 15:32:25	@Espyo	hm, yeah, that's not a lot
2016-04-24 15:32:49	Marty2000	I wanted to explore the Shaded Garden out of bounds and I got fed up, so I decided to punch some enemies
2016-04-24 15:33:00	Marty2000	lol
2016-04-24 15:33:02	@Espyo	lol
2016-04-24 15:33:19	@Espyo	well, I'm sure there are more enemies out there with different HPs
2016-04-24 15:33:24	Marty2000	By the way, Nvortex told me there's a Waddlepus with a lower HP
2016-04-24 15:33:26	@Espyo	because the game has data for every enemy's HP
2016-04-24 15:33:30	Marty2000	in the Beastly Caverns
2016-04-24 15:33:35	Marty2000	(battle enemies)
2016-04-24 15:33:40	@Espyo	and then has data for what HP every enemy INSTANCE should have
2016-04-24 15:33:47	@Espyo	I mean, in the game files, when you place an enemy
2016-04-24 15:33:49	@Espyo	you can say what its HP is
2016-04-24 15:33:50	Marty2000	Oh, ok
2016-04-24 15:33:53	@Espyo	if you don't, it's the default
2016-04-24 15:34:00	@Espyo	so...there's probably hundreds more
2016-04-24 15:34:05	@Espyo	I'll write a script one day to automatically compare
2016-04-24 15:36:43	Marty2000	I'm wondering if this one http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/16/1461508576-red.png
2016-04-24 15:36:51	Marty2000	isn't blue as well in the gamecube version
2016-04-24 15:37:23	Marty2000	By the way I'll check Pikmin 2 later
2016-04-24 15:37:24	@Espyo	on the manual?
2016-04-24 15:37:34	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-24 15:37:52	@Espyo	it's red
2016-04-24 15:37:58	@Espyo	but also has a blue arrow
2016-04-24 15:38:14	@Espyo	it's the exact same image
2016-04-24 15:38:22	Marty2000	Ok

2016-04-24 19:51:34	Nvortex	i think it is because its a plant infobox
2016-04-24 19:51:42	Nvortex	because i acn do it in the orange bulborb page
2016-04-24 19:51:56	Marty2000	Ah
2016-04-24 19:52:00	Marty2000	Maybe

2016-04-24 19:57:02	@J	I would say only have both images when they're different
2016-04-24 19:57:11	@J	otherwise it's content for the sake of content, doesn't really add anything
2016-04-24 19:57:13	Marty2000	Hi J
2016-04-24 19:57:41	@J	the only thing is you might want to distinguish between the case where the style is the same across all games, and the case where we haven't added the new image yet
2016-04-24 19:57:44	@J	hi
2016-04-24 19:58:03	@J	but I don't think that's an issue specific to infobox images, so I wouldn't worry

2016-04-24 21:07:32	Marty2000	It's... surprising
2016-04-24 21:08:39	@Espyo	what are they?
2016-04-24 21:09:04	Marty2000	The Spongebob team is actually more popular, but Team Patrick has more victories, so we win
2016-04-24 21:09:28	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-04-24 21:09:36	@Espyo	I wouldn't have guessed SpongeBob's popularity from playing
2016-04-24 21:09:42	@Espyo	but I did guess he would be the most popular from the start
2016-04-24 21:09:56	Marty2000	I thought our team was much more popular because I kept playing against Team Patrick
2016-04-24 21:10:33	Nvortex	next splatfest: olimar or louie

2016-04-24 23:42:33	@PikFan	we're playing Splatoon, so responses will be slow
2016-04-24 23:42:48	ScruffyChat	heh, no problem
2016-04-24 23:42:49	@PikFan	wow, Gaming98 disconnected /again/?
2016-04-24 23:42:55	ScruffyChat	I've got some bad news though
2016-04-24 23:42:58	@PikFan	?
2016-04-24 23:43:07	ScruffyChat	I'm going to have to tone down the Blending
2016-04-24 23:43:11	ScruffyChat	At least, no more videos
2016-04-24 23:43:22	ScruffyChat	no more Blender animations
2016-04-24 23:43:38	ScruffyChat	I can probably still do small blends, but no more animations
2016-04-24 23:43:53	ScruffyChat	I had to replace my battery today
2016-04-24 23:44:10	ScruffyChat	And it may have been old, but it only very recently started acting weird
2016-04-24 23:44:38	ScruffyChat	I am confident Blender had a hand in weakening it
2016-04-24 23:46:31	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-04-24 23:46:31	Neocraftz1553	maybe so
2016-04-24 23:46:31	Neocraftz1553	Did you leave it on for more than 2 days?
2016-04-24 23:46:31	Neocraftz1553	and is it a laptop or a desktop
2016-04-24 23:46:38	@PikFan	that sucks
2016-04-24 23:46:47	ScruffyChat	It's a laptop
2016-04-24 23:46:53	@PikFan	but to be fair, you only ever made 1 animation...
2016-04-24 23:46:55	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-24 23:47:01	@PikFan	or did you recently make another one?
2016-04-24 23:47:02	ScruffyChat	And I have left it on for more than two days before, but that was for Blender
2016-04-24 23:47:05	Neocraftz1553	didn't you make two?
2016-04-24 23:47:16	Neocraftz1553	yeah, probably the main cause
2016-04-24 23:47:18	Neocraftz1553	overworked
2016-04-24 23:47:21	@PikFan	brb Espyo
2016-04-24 23:47:47	ScruffyChat	I mean, I've made a few small animations for testing, but I only ever published the Scornet Maestro one
2016-04-24 23:47:59	Neocraftz1553	I have a Laptop too, and the battery...
2016-04-24 23:48:07	Neocraftz1553	lets just say its hating blender
2016-04-24 23:48:24	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I've got to really dial back my use of it
2016-04-24 23:48:34	ScruffyChat	Sorry everybody
2016-04-24 23:49:51	Neocraftz1553	its ok, not many people ask for animations, anyways
2016-04-24 23:49:52	ScruffyChat	If this computer were just for Blender, it'd probably be okay, but it has a lot more on it than that
2016-04-24 23:50:10	ScruffyChat	Yeah, but I mean big renders that take a long time might be out as well
2016-04-24 23:50:13	ScruffyChat	Like area renders
2016-04-24 23:50:18	Neocraftz1553	:|
2016-04-24 23:50:20	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-04-24 23:50:29	Neocraftz1553	It's still ok
2016-04-24 23:50:34	@PikFan	oh, that's too bad...
2016-04-24 23:50:51	Neocraftz1553	I tried to make an area render too
2016-04-24 23:50:55	Neocraftz1553	Zen Garden
2016-04-24 23:50:58	Marty2000	I got into the enemy base

2016-04-24 23:51:31	@PikFan	how many did he get?

2016-04-25 00:12:17	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, some ideas for pre-packed areas for the engine
2016-04-25 00:12:17	Neocraftz1553	Maybe a challenge mode level from Pikmin 3?

2016-04-25 00:13:30	@Espyo	too many and too good, and it's starting to be a fangame proper
2016-04-25 00:13:38	@Espyo	too few, and it doesn't demonstrate the engine well enough

2016-04-25 21:15:47	@PikFan	wait
2016-04-25 21:15:56	@PikFan	I think I meant "play it safe"
2016-04-25 21:16:03	@PikFan	but you all know what I meant :P
2016-04-25 21:16:12	@PikFan	words, they're weird
2016-04-25 21:16:22	ScruffyChat	I liked "take it safe:" it's play it safe and take it easy combined
2016-04-25 21:16:24	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-25 21:16:25	ScruffyChat	easafe
2016-04-25 21:16:34	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-04-25 21:16:54	@PikFan	play it easy
2016-04-25 21:17:15	@PikFan	you know, we're actually learning "play" verbs in Japanese right now
2016-04-25 21:17:31	@PikFan	so like, playing an instrument, playing a sport, etc
2016-04-25 21:17:58	@PikFan	there's several different verbs, though
2016-04-25 21:18:05	@PikFan	even for instruments
2016-04-25 21:18:21	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-04-25 21:19:15	ScruffyChat	There are several different verbs for playing instruments?
2016-04-25 21:19:28	@PikFan	yes
2016-04-25 21:19:37	ScruffyChat	That's so neat
2016-04-25 21:19:46	@PikFan	for instance, チェロ を ひきます means "I play chello"
2016-04-25 21:20:01	@PikFan	the verb ひきます is used for string instruments
2016-04-25 21:20:09	ScruffyChat	Do they spell it that way?
2016-04-25 21:20:22	@PikFan	spell what?
2016-04-25 21:20:29	ScruffyChat	cello as "chello"
2016-04-25 21:20:44	@PikFan	oh, it's cello
2016-04-25 21:20:57	@PikFan	for some reason I thought it was spelled "chello" lol
2016-04-25 21:21:02	ScruffyChat	heh, no problem
2016-04-25 21:21:18	@PikFan	but actually, cello is a loan word
2016-04-25 21:21:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah, Italian c's (when followed by e's) sound like "ch"
2016-04-25 21:21:46	@PikFan	so they write it as チェロ, which reads "chero"
2016-04-25 21:22:01	ScruffyChat	Neat
2016-04-25 21:22:30	@PikFan	but anyway, the other verb we've learned is ふきます, which is used for...uh
2016-04-25 21:22:38	@PikFan	well, instruments that you blow into
2016-04-25 21:22:43	ScruffyChat	aerophones
2016-04-25 21:22:49	@PikFan	yeah
2016-04-25 21:23:17	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-04-25 21:23:19	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-04-25 21:23:29	@PikFan	yeah
2016-04-25 21:24:14	ScruffyChat	Is there one specific for piano, or is it part of percussion verb, or...?

2016-04-25 21:38:54	Nvortex	i showed the render of the vampuid to my friend that helped with the idea, he loved it. at first i didnt want to show it to him because i was waiting for the other render, but since i had told him that someone was making a render, he remembered today and asked about it
2016-04-25 21:40:15	ScruffyChat	Sorry that I couldn't complete the render earlier but my computer's battery started behaving weirdly and I had to take a break from Blender
2016-04-25 21:40:35	ScruffyChat	Now that it's okay I think the hanger vampuid render shouldn't be too arduous for it
