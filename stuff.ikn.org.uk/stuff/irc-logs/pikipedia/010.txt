2014-11-17 19:37:20	@Espyo	lolwut
2014-11-17 19:37:21	@Espyo	he crazy
2014-11-17 19:37:28	@Espyo	that's Dave, I think he's the "big glitcher"
2014-11-17 19:37:39	@Espyo	that "finds" glitches like leaders in P3 suddenly flying into space
2014-11-17 19:38:00	@Espyo	and it wasn't a big glitch, it was just me noticing that the render distance cuts off on the Wistful Wild
2014-11-17 19:38:06	@Espyo	it's neat 'cause it's new, but it's hardly big
2014-11-17 19:38:12	@Espyo	[[Glitches in Pikmin 2#World cut-off]]
2014-11-17 19:38:13	Testyo	"Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#World_cut-off" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#World_cut-off
2014-11-17 19:38:21	@Espyo	I've seen that happen in OpenGL
2014-11-17 19:42:15	@J	hmm, yeah, that sort of thing is fairly common
2014-11-17 19:42:29	@J	probably a bug in the 'only run stuff you're looking at' code
2014-11-17 19:44:04	Yoshi2	why "big glitcher" in quotes?
2014-11-17 19:46:23	@Espyo	'cause I'm very sure his "discoveries" are bs
2014-11-17 19:46:37	@Espyo	a leader randomly flying into the air and falling gently down afterwards?
2014-11-17 19:46:45	@Espyo	seems weird that speedrunners wouldn't have used it
2014-11-17 19:46:51	@Espyo	but hey, it was plausible
2014-11-17 19:47:03	@Espyo	until he started saying stories of a crapton of other glitches that have to be lies
2014-11-17 19:47:12	@Espyo	can't really remember any more examples
2014-11-17 19:47:17	@Espyo	I must've purged them out of my mind
2014-11-17 19:48:22	@Espyo	interestingly, that screenshot I took for the glitch was with Dolphin
2014-11-17 19:48:28	@Espyo	but it only works in Dolphin in OpenGL mode
2014-11-17 19:48:41	@Espyo	anyway, that glitch is still noteworthy
2014-11-17 19:48:47	@Espyo	because that's pretty much the only place it happens
2014-11-17 19:48:49	Yoshi2	some person I knew used to talk about somebody who said that he found the triforce in Zelda: OoT
2014-11-17 19:48:50	@Espyo	at least, that anybody knows
2014-11-17 19:49:07	@Espyo	heh, one in every 100 people claim they got the triforce
2014-11-17 19:49:09	@Espyo	they're "that kid"
2014-11-17 19:49:25	@Espyo	"no, I did! my uncle works at Nintendo and he told me the secret cheat code to getting it!"
2014-11-17 19:49:35	Yoshi2	it helps that I was involved in a Zelda forum when I heard of that
2014-11-17 19:49:42	@Espyo	anyway, that glitch is really weird... why is there draw distance?
2014-11-17 19:49:46	@Espyo	I mean, of course there is draw distance
2014-11-17 19:49:52	@Espyo	but like that? I've never seen anything like that in Pikmin 2
2014-11-17 19:49:56	@Espyo	not even with free-camera
2014-11-17 19:50:21	@Espyo	oh, because DirectX doesn't cut off
2014-11-17 19:50:24	@Espyo	at least not on Pikmin 2
2014-11-17 19:50:33	@Espyo	I can see it cut off with free-cam on OpenGL Dolphin
2014-11-17 19:51:57	@Espyo	hm, all right, it's a perfectly normal render distance cut-off
2014-11-17 19:52:08	@Espyo	they just mis-judged it
2014-11-17 19:52:27	@Espyo	thinking that with the zoom at the closest level, nobody would be able to see far enough into the distance, because no point in any map allows it
2014-11-17 19:52:34	@Espyo	except this point on the WW, and facing that cave
2014-11-17 20:00:41	@Espyo	the game is well capable of rendering loads
2014-11-17 20:00:50	@Espyo	so keeping the render distance so short is kind of weird

2014-11-17 21:03:32	@J	it's only in the middle of a good run that you suddenly bring out hilarious mistakes that you've never even done before for a whole 2 minutes
2014-11-17 21:10:37	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-17 21:10:43	@Espyo	and then you spend the next 20 tries doing stupid mistakes
2014-11-17 21:10:48	@Espyo	and you need to go away so the mistakes stop
2014-11-17 21:10:53	@Espyo	but then you come back and they continue
2014-11-17 21:10:55	@Espyo	you start getting mad
2014-11-17 21:11:03	@Espyo	and like 5 tries later it finally starts slowly working well again

2014-11-17 22:01:55	@J	bleeeech
2014-11-17 22:02:09	@J	a couple of hours of grinding and I get a 1-death run
2014-11-17 22:02:10	@J	so close
2014-11-17 22:02:44	@J	I've been putting the last 3 levels (before the 'difficult' levels) off for some time, but it turns they're not actually impossible
2014-11-17 22:02:53	@J	2 of them I beat in one evening each
2014-11-17 22:03:16	@J	so I don't want to stop until I've beaten this one, but my hand is starting to cramp up a bit
2014-11-17 22:06:40	@Espyo	hehe
2014-11-17 22:06:51	@Espyo	you know a level's good when it looks downright impossible, but as you get better, it becomes very possible
2014-11-17 22:07:05	@Espyo	except the light at the end of the tunnel is always very far away
2014-11-17 22:07:22	@Espyo	one of the Pikmin 3 Mission Mode stages looks like it's gonna be that, judging from a friend
2014-11-17 22:07:32	@Espyo	you have to defeat three bosses in a huge area with like 30 enemies
2014-11-17 22:07:36	@Espyo	and you have 12 minutes
2014-11-17 22:07:41	@Espyo	it looks impossible
2014-11-17 22:07:47	@Espyo	but I'm sure it'll get possibler as I do it
2014-11-17 22:10:15	@J	hmm, yeah
2014-11-17 22:10:25	@J	I have improved my time from 7 minutes to 1 minute already
2014-11-17 22:10:39	@J	SS is probably around 55s

2014-11-17 22:15:46	Spark	how?
2014-11-17 22:16:12	@Espyo	like class car{ seat front_seat; person driver; }

2014-11-17 23:28:40	@J	now I have to record it and see if you can spot the part where I almost died IRL
2014-11-17 23:30:17	@J	...uh, except I can't, because replays are broken in the version I'm using

2014-11-17 23:30:48	@Espyo	oh, hack?
2014-11-17 23:31:39	@J	I have to find where the Steam version saves its files, then copy my save file over ther
2014-11-17 23:31:40	@J	e
2014-11-17 23:31:46	@J	then, by the looks of it, change the recording profile
2014-11-17 23:33:14	@J	hmm, nope
2014-11-17 23:55:52	@J	okay, managed it
2014-11-17 23:56:00	@J	Steam saves game data in 2 places for some reason
2014-11-17 23:56:20	@J	and the save game is in the 'stats0' file, not the 'save' folder

2014-11-18 00:02:59	@J	heh
2014-11-18 00:03:08	@Espyo	which is what Firefox tells me to do anyway
2014-11-18 00:03:10	@J	why do you need Firefox to use VLC?
2014-11-18 00:03:22	@Espyo	link

2014-11-18 00:04:15	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2014-11-18 00:04:21	@Espyo	but Firefox was already opening

2014-11-18 00:04:53	@Espyo	night
2014-11-18 00:05:00	@Espyo	you should probably unhook yourself from the game and sleep too

2014-11-18 14:10:37	--	smuckola- is now known as smuckola
2014-11-18 14:11:01	Yoshi2	the help page does mention the server address and the channel: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Help:Chat
2014-11-18 14:12:04	smuckola	i just discovered pikmin.wikia.com and edited a few pages and then discovered the insanely miscommunicated split/merge there between sites, interrogated  somebody about it, and they eventually pointed me to a hidden page on pikminwiki.com so I'm reading about it
2014-11-18 14:12:16	Yoshi2	and IRC stands for internet relay chat, so it wouldn't be too far fetched to call an irc channel a "chat room"
2014-11-18 14:12:17	smuckola	so i'm just trying to catch up
2014-11-18 14:12:42	smuckola	yeah it'd be completely wrong to call it that, but ok ^_^
2014-11-18 14:13:28	Yoshi2	of course
2014-11-18 14:13:31	smuckola	it sounds like the whole issue is framed as being wikia's fault
2014-11-18 14:13:47	Yoshi2	that's something I heard as well
2014-11-18 14:13:51	smuckola	which, speaking as a veteran wikipedian and a general wikimedia fan, really really sucks
2014-11-18 14:13:53	smuckola	to the max
2014-11-18 14:14:11	smuckola	i am a wikia noob.  i just joined wikia JUST to join pikmin.wikia.com two days ago! lol
2014-11-18 14:14:17	smuckola	and here i find this.
2014-11-18 14:14:23	smuckola	a major meltdown
2014-11-18 14:14:39	smuckola	i mean they're saying that this is a trend, for wikis to move away from wikia.
2014-11-18 14:15:00	Yoshi2	I've heard that wikia is bad for some reasons
2014-11-18 14:15:01	smuckola	unhospitable or uninhabitable for some
2014-11-18 14:15:21	smuckola	increasingly overbearing advertising presence, major disruptive changes without consensus
2014-11-18 14:15:45	smuckola	that just sucks because wikia is supposed to be a haven for fandom
2014-11-18 14:16:08	smuckola	it's supposed to be the solution to the problem of deleting unencyclopedic content from wikipedia. 
2014-11-18 14:17:21	smuckola	the fake explanation of the issue on pikmin.wikia.com is total nonsensical jibberish, so i guess i'll get a clue and issue a better signpost there
2014-11-18 14:17:45	smuckola	well, it's partially nonsensical jibberish *and* it's partially totally wrong
2014-11-18 14:17:51	smuckola	apparently.  or something!
2014-11-18 14:18:34	smuckola	the main thing is that as a pikmin noob, i'm happy to find more pikmin freaks!
2014-11-18 14:19:00	smuckola	i just discovered pikmin 3 a few months ago and i was immediately a budding speed runner
2014-11-18 14:21:40	smuckola	and i thank the people who work on pikmin and wiki community stuff
2014-11-18 14:22:39	Yoshi2	I've only recently become involved with Pikmin because I started working on parsing the music sequence data of Pikmin 1 and Pikmin 2
2014-11-18 14:22:54	Yoshi2	and the same music format happens to be used by Mario Sunshine and Zelda WW
2014-11-18 14:24:23	Yoshi2	but I have played Pikmin 3 myself, it was a lot of fun
2014-11-18 14:27:12	smuckola	wow cool.
2014-11-18 14:27:36	smuckola	Yoshi2: so you're reverse engineering some gamecube or wii stuff
2014-11-18 14:27:51	smuckola	are you writing software, or are there standard tools and formats for this?
2014-11-18 14:28:06	Yoshi2	I'm writing software myself
2014-11-18 14:28:23	smuckola	wow that's super cool, man.  i hang out with fail0verflow and other such people.
2014-11-18 14:28:36	Yoshi2	luckily, there is a guy who works on the SMS music format who I was able to ask about some important parts of the format
2014-11-18 14:28:51	smuckola	i met a guy in there who's reverse engineering i think Super Mario Galaxy
2014-11-18 14:28:54	smuckola	for its data formats
2014-11-18 14:29:01	smuckola	it was either SMS or SMG or both
2014-11-18 14:29:10	Yoshi2	I have a lot of respect for people who reverse engineer formats
2014-11-18 14:29:16	smuckola	yeah that's hard.
2014-11-18 14:29:27	smuckola	there are tools now which scan binary blobs for other embedded blobs.
2014-11-18 14:29:41	smuckola	they can detect, say, jpeg or lzw or other data streams
2014-11-18 14:29:55	smuckola	encryption formats, audio, video, image
2014-11-18 14:30:07	smuckola	usually for embedded systems like firmware images
2014-11-18 14:30:17	smuckola	detecting filesystems
2014-11-18 14:30:19	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-11-18 14:30:25	smuckola	so i have been told that helps a lot
2014-11-18 14:30:58	smuckola	video games are embedded systems.  i've read about gamecube and wii having a lot more standardized formats, like actual filesystems
2014-11-18 14:31:26	smuckola	as opposed to N64 which has custom data blobs in a giant compressed blob or whatever
2014-11-18 14:31:54	smuckola	so even finding the text for a translation is super hard on n64
2014-11-18 14:33:20	Yoshi2	with better hardware, there is probably less need for custom formats
2014-11-18 14:38:49	smuckola	yes.
2014-11-18 14:38:53	smuckola	less embeddingness!
2014-11-18 14:38:55	smuckola	lol
2014-11-18 14:39:01	smuckola	more encryption!
2014-11-18 14:39:03	smuckola	:/
2014-11-18 14:39:39	smuckola	i am all over the idea of cracking the Wii U *just* for the ability to remove time limits on pikmin 3!   lol   that game is WICKED HARD.
2014-11-18 14:39:57	smuckola	it's so cruelly hard just to learn 
2014-11-18 14:40:03	smuckola	especially mission modes
2014-11-18 14:40:27	Yoshi2	heh

2014-11-18 20:00:11	Yoshi2	if it had a leak, it should have a wet spot somewhere on it

2014-11-18 20:04:49	@Espyo	I did
2014-11-18 20:04:52	@Espyo	I tried with Chrome
2014-11-18 20:05:00	@Espyo	and I never visited Pikipedia with Chrome before, I don't think
2014-11-18 20:05:01	@Espyo	so...
2014-11-18 20:05:08	@Espyo	even if I did, it was ages ago
2014-11-18 20:05:08	@Espyo	hm
2014-11-18 20:05:13	@Espyo	but I still should probably skip the cache
2014-11-18 20:05:36	@Espyo	nope, it's no used
2014-11-18 20:06:59	@Espyo	*no use
2014-11-18 20:08:06	@J	yeah, it depends on the page
2014-11-18 20:08:13	@J	but action=purge doesn't seem to do anything
2014-11-18 20:08:24	@J	so it's some sort of caching, but possibly not by MW itself
2014-11-18 20:08:31	@Espyo	ugh
2014-11-18 20:08:31	@J	therefore I'd let Porple know
2014-11-18 20:11:07	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-18 20:11:18	@Espyo	I'll have to tell him about the favicon and poll extension too
2014-11-18 20:13:43	@J	do we have a favicon idea?

2014-11-18 20:15:34	@PikFan	...random period
2014-11-18 20:16:42	@Espyo	we need to change the favicon, and add a poll extension like Fanon
2014-11-18 20:16:56	@Espyo	and while we're at it, warn Porple about the fact that the anonymous user notice is broken
2014-11-18 20:17:24	@PikFan	Speaking of the poll, Fanon's poll needs to be update bad
2014-11-18 20:17:39	@PikFan	...as does the rest of the main page

2014-11-18 20:21:28	Yoshi2	but solving the mystery of the leaking milk carton is very important
2014-11-18 20:22:23	@Espyo	it is
2014-11-18 20:22:38	@Espyo	but there's this guy on Pikmin Wiki, he wants to know what's up with the move
2014-11-18 20:22:44	@Espyo	and he's kind of confused about the notice
2014-11-18 20:22:47	@Espyo	because... it's broken and all
2014-11-18 20:22:54	@Espyo	I DID already link him to the important page, so we'll see
2014-11-18 20:23:04	@Espyo	oh, the guy is a bit more important 'cause he has years of experience on Wikipedia
2014-11-18 20:23:14	@Espyo	so, he can either be a help, or a douche that ignores us and goes on Pikmin Wiki

2014-11-18 21:02:17	@J	you mean make them admins
2014-11-18 21:02:18	@J	?
2014-11-18 21:03:22	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-18 21:03:27	@J	yeah, I can do that
2014-11-18 21:03:49	@Espyo	oh, ok
2014-11-18 21:04:09	@J	confirmation that it's the same as the accounts on Wikia would be good
2014-11-18 21:04:14	@J	don't want impersonators
2014-11-18 21:04:19	@Espyo	they have a skype group where only admins go
2014-11-18 21:04:21	@Espyo	so
2014-11-18 21:04:23	@J	even if you just confirm via Skype or something
2014-11-18 21:04:23	@J	yeah
2014-11-18 21:04:33	@Espyo	at first I was going to do something WAY overly elaborate

2014-11-18 21:04:37	@Espyo	*silly
2014-11-18 21:04:58	@J	I mean, yeah, Skype is fine, just not giving someone admin rights if you've only contacted them at pikminwiki.com
2014-11-18 21:05:29	@J	well, it took them quite a while to ask
2014-11-18 21:05:49	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-18 21:05:54	@Espyo	no, they asked more times
2014-11-18 21:05:57	@Espyo	I just kept delaying because lazy
2014-11-18 21:06:26	@J	I see 6 potential new admins at Wikia?
2014-11-18 21:06:35	@Espyo	I think it's around that number, yeah
2014-11-18 21:06:51	@J	account names at Pikipedia would be good

2014-11-18 21:07:20	@Espyo	so yeah, they're in a hurry, but they TOO are slow to saying what their names are
2014-11-18 21:07:24	@Espyo	I asked like 3 days aog
2014-11-18 21:07:25	@Espyo	*ago
2014-11-18 21:07:39	@J	WRT bureaucrat, I would suggest only two more (1 in 3 admins being bureaucrat is generally more than enough)
2014-11-18 21:08:05	@J	but if they really want to keep their Wikia levels I don't mind
2014-11-18 21:08:08	@Espyo	well, they'll be getting whatever I'm getting
2014-11-18 21:08:09	@J	looks like that's 4/6
2014-11-18 21:08:15	@J	you're already admin?
2014-11-18 21:08:17	@Espyo	I'm one level below you
2014-11-18 21:08:25	@J	hmm
2014-11-18 21:08:35	@Espyo	in that I can't change user roles
2014-11-18 21:08:38	@J	well, we should have at least one more bureaucrat
2014-11-18 21:08:49	@J	ATM it's only me and Porple who can be easily contacted
2014-11-18 21:08:49	@Espyo	if so, that'd have to be me
2014-11-18 21:08:59	@Espyo	they've been around for just a couple of years

2014-11-18 21:09:07	@Espyo	we're classics, and we're the most competent
2014-11-18 21:09:14	@Espyo	they have every right to be an admin as they were, sure

2014-11-18 21:09:17	@J	'classics'
2014-11-18 21:09:21	@Espyo	they're not us
2014-11-18 21:09:22	@J	really the wrong word, but sure
2014-11-18 21:09:30	@Espyo	but we are classics
2014-11-18 21:09:34	@Espyo	all right, vintage

2014-11-18 21:10:03	@J	I would be worried that it would seem almost discriminatory, making them all sysop and us bureaucrats
2014-11-18 21:10:14	@J	but I don't know if they'd be touchy about that sort of thing
2014-11-18 21:10:23	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-18 21:10:24	@J	if it were the other way around, I wouldn't worry
2014-11-18 21:10:30	@J	but hey, you're the one talking to them
2014-11-18 21:10:38	@J	vintage is even worse
2014-11-18 21:10:46	@J	we're not collectibles
2014-11-18 21:10:50	@Espyo	or we can just leave them all as sysops... I mean, we don't really immediately need another bureau
2014-11-18 21:10:57	@Espyo	how does "steampunk" sound?
2014-11-18 21:11:09	@J	.
2014-11-18 21:12:24	@J	if we have 9 active admins, I think one more bureaucrat would be good; I'll leave it up to you to nominate yourself or ask them to nominate one of themselves
2014-11-18 21:13:22	@J	BTW, full rights are here: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:ListGroupRights
2014-11-18 21:13:49	@J	userrights and interwiki are probably the most likely to come up
2014-11-18 21:13:56	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-18 21:14:39	@Espyo	I'm not even sure if wikia has bureau vs admin
2014-11-18 21:14:45	@J	it does
2014-11-18 21:14:48	@Espyo	might just be sysop and that's that

2014-11-18 23:51:25	@J	mhm
2014-11-18 23:51:26	@Espyo	just some time ago, I was living in a nightmare keeping the game at 25fps, with 50 Pikmin on-screen
2014-11-18 23:51:32	@Espyo	now it runs at 120+ on my PC
2014-11-18 23:51:38	@Espyo	and on his crappy PC it runs fine at 30
2014-11-18 23:51:43	@Espyo	so I'm... pretty shocked
2014-11-18 23:51:56	@Espyo	but anyway, decided to start saving time and closing programs
2014-11-18 23:51:59	@Espyo	like Testyo

2014-11-19 07:30:12	Yoshi2	hey smuckola 
2014-11-19 07:30:26	Yoshi2	just a bit of university stuff
2014-11-19 07:41:07	Yoshi2	I'm also coming close to finishing my new piece of code for defining the format of BMS files (music sequence files of SMS, Zelda and Pikmin 1/2)
2014-11-19 07:42:36	smuckola	Yoshi2: [23:48]  <smuckola> http://imgur.com/a/kBKIh

2014-11-19 07:42:49	smuckola	Yoshi2: are you in a community of reverse engineering?
2014-11-19 07:43:22	Yoshi2	nope
2014-11-19 07:44:06	Yoshi2	I'm just very interested in reading about and finding unused things in games
2014-11-19 07:44:33	Yoshi2	I also like to work with some kinds of binary data
2014-11-19 07:46:02	Yoshi2	one of my previous projects was a python implementation of the Yaz0 compression algorithm based on some specifications I found on the internet
2014-11-19 07:49:33	smuckola	k
2014-11-19 07:50:01	smuckola	maybe you should hang out with fail0verflow and dolphin and friends
2014-11-19 07:56:51	Yoshi2	I'm not familiar with writing exploits and emulators for closed hardware
2014-11-19 08:03:42	Yoshi2	if I knew gamecube assembly, I'd probably poke around in the game executables for more clues on how to parse or play the BMS files
2014-11-19 08:14:04	smuckola	well i mean at the very least, that'd be a good place to find other people who are doing relevant things
2014-11-19 08:16:05	Yoshi2	possibly
2014-11-19 08:32:34	Yoshi2	one of the things I had to do for the BMS project was to write a simple-ish midi file writer to convert a BMS file to a MIDI file
2014-11-19 08:32:45	Yoshi2	I was suprised to see how simple the midi format actually was
2014-11-19 08:33:35	Yoshi2	two other midi modules I tested were either incorrectly licensed or too high-level for what I needed
2014-11-19 08:50:17	smuckola	yes midi is inherently simple, created in the 1980s
2014-11-19 08:50:26	smuckola	and, totally universal
2014-11-19 08:50:44	smuckola	though extended over the years to have things like vibrato and pressure
2014-11-19 08:51:27	smuckola	you're concerned about copyright licenses, so i hope youre not intending to prominently mass distribute the soundtrack ;)
2014-11-19 08:52:38	smuckola	i was astonished to see the brainmush logic used on pikmin.wikia.com, thinking that copyright infringement is only illegal if you're caught.  and if it's a few years old, copyright enforcement dissolves.  and then "nintendo" doesn't "care".  as if nintendo is some guy with hurt feelings.
2014-11-19 08:53:01	smuckola	so they can magically post pikmin 1 and 2 soundtracks but not pikmin 3 *just quite yet*
2014-11-19 08:58:16	Yoshi2	the sound files for all the instruments in the games are huge, I couldn't really distribute those ;)
2014-11-19 08:58:52	Yoshi2	I'll probably write a tool that converts the soundfiles into a soundfont that you can use yourself, and my current tool will convert BMS files into midi if you have the BMS files
2014-11-19 09:00:05	Yoshi2	for either of those, you will have to have a copy of the game files, however you manage to get them ;)
2014-11-19 09:01:08	Yoshi2	I'll be on my way again, see you later

2014-11-19 21:07:15	@Espyo	I'll reword it later
2014-11-19 21:07:28	Yoshi2	how can you even tell that White Pikmin aren't immune to poison if poison doesn't even exist?
2014-11-19 21:07:37	@Espyo	J: the user that went to Pikmin Wiki, and has several years of Wikipedia experience
2014-11-19 21:07:45	@Espyo	yeah, I think there's probably a paradox for that
2014-11-19 21:07:48	@Espyo	or a logical falacy
2014-11-19 21:07:59	@PikFan	*fallacy
2014-11-19 21:08:38	@PikFan	err, my friend wants to say something
2014-11-19 21:08:51	@PikFan	Hello I am Maggie
2014-11-19 21:08:53	Yoshi2	it would be more correct to say that "It is unknown whether White Pikmin are still immune to poison because Pikmin 3 has no poisonous traps."."
2014-11-19 21:09:14	Miles	It does have poison

2014-11-19 21:09:31	Miles	I guess nowhere that you can get whites in Mission Mode
2014-11-19 21:09:59	Miles	Not that it matters since poison can't kill Pikmin anymore in the first place
2014-11-19 21:10:19	@Espyo	heh, hello
2014-11-19 21:10:31	Yoshi2	that is very likely
2014-11-19 21:10:35	@Espyo	you mean the Vehemoth Phosbat?
2014-11-19 21:10:37	@Espyo	I thought that
2014-11-19 21:10:42	@Espyo	but I guess those are just sprinkles
2014-11-19 21:10:46	@Espyo	probably poison, but
2014-11-19 21:10:49	@Espyo	it looks so... magical
2014-11-19 21:10:58	@Espyo	it gives kids a wrong idea of what poison is like
2014-11-19 21:11:09	Miles	Toady Bloysters too
2014-11-19 21:11:11	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-19 21:11:15	@Espyo	though that's really ink
2014-11-19 21:11:21	@PikFan	Magic I love magic- Maggie
2014-11-19 21:11:22	@Espyo	non-fatal choking ink
2014-11-19 21:11:35	Miles	Stop coming up with excuses to not call it poison
2014-11-19 21:11:44	@Espyo	it's coded as poison
2014-11-19 21:11:48	@Espyo	I'd be the first one to say it
2014-11-19 21:11:51	@Espyo	but
2014-11-19 21:11:53	@Espyo	it's just goopy ink
2014-11-19 21:12:03	Miles	Poisonous goopy ink
2014-11-19 21:12:07	@Espyo	it's not-poisonous poison goopy ink, really
2014-11-19 21:12:10	@PikFan	okay, back
2014-11-19 21:12:42	@PikFan	hmm, we need a concrete definition of poison
2014-11-19 21:13:07	@PikFan	...maybe the ink has poisonous bits in it
2014-11-19 21:13:11	@Espyo	something that poisons
2014-11-19 21:13:16	@PikFan	WAIT NO
2014-11-19 21:13:26	@PikFan	poison is lethal
2014-11-19 21:13:38	@Espyo	not necessarily, I don't think
2014-11-19 21:13:50	@Espyo	I mean... food poisoning isn't necessarily lethal, right?
2014-11-19 21:13:58	@PikFan	true, yes
2014-11-19 21:14:09	@Espyo	wait, poisson is fish
2014-11-19 21:14:14	@Espyo	Toady Bloysters are aquatic, like fish
2014-11-19 21:14:14	@PikFan	point is, they don't die
2014-11-19 21:14:19	@Espyo	hence, Toady Bloysters use poison
2014-11-19 21:14:22	@Espyo	foolproof

2014-11-19 21:14:24	Yoshi2	"It is unknown whether White Pikmin are still immune to poison in Pikmin 3 because the missions involving White Pikmin contain no poisonous monsters."
2014-11-19 21:14:31	Yoshi2	done
2014-11-19 21:14:34	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-19 21:14:45	@PikFan	so maybe it's smoke
2014-11-19 21:14:48	@Espyo	whether or not the enemies use poison in Pikmin 3, that sentence is still true
2014-11-19 21:14:51	@Espyo	underwater smoke
2014-11-19 21:14:51	@Espyo	brilliant
2014-11-19 21:14:55	@Espyo	I like it
2014-11-19 21:15:10	@PikFan	...which is stupid, yes
2014-11-19 21:15:28	@Espyo	...who wrote the Plasm Wraith thing this anon just fixed?
2014-11-19 21:15:28	@Espyo	good frief
2014-11-19 21:15:30	@Espyo	*grief
2014-11-19 21:16:07	@PikFan	we're surrounded by idiots
2014-11-19 21:16:18	@Espyo	just another reason why we had to move out of wikia
2014-11-19 21:16:25	@Espyo	on wikia, EVERYBODY just splattered junk
2014-11-19 21:16:30	@Espyo	because it's the place EVERYBODY goes too
2014-11-19 21:16:33	@Espyo	over here, there's more control
2014-11-19 21:18:55	Miles	But Whites are also in Bingo Battle, right?
2014-11-19 21:19:06	Miles	You can't describe that as "missions involving White Pikmin"

2014-11-20 19:08:12	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2014-11-20 19:08:23	@Espyo	hey
2014-11-20 21:03:50	@J	.
2014-11-20 21:04:02	@J	so fix PFE
2014-11-20 21:04:16	@J	[23:22:47] @J http://sprunge.us/JCVK
2014-11-20 21:04:26	@J	(I'm assuming that's the right thing)
2014-11-20 21:05:24	Yoshi2	as far as I can tell, my BMS parsing works correctly so far
2014-11-20 21:05:25	@Espyo	later
2014-11-20 21:05:29	@Espyo	oh, nice
2014-11-20 21:05:59	Yoshi2	which means I can write the code for playing music now
2014-11-20 21:06:09	@J	sad
2014-11-20 21:06:12	Yoshi2	with command line use in mind
2014-11-20 21:06:35	@J	you should write everything as a library
2014-11-20 21:06:39	@J	then write interfaces on top
2014-11-20 21:07:36	Yoshi2	that would be the best way to do it
2014-11-20 21:09:04	@Espyo	yes, Yoshi2, overcomplicate everything
2014-11-20 21:09:12	@J	silly Espyo
2014-11-20 21:09:12	@Espyo	it's the best for everybody involved
2014-11-20 21:09:16	@J	one day you'll learn
2014-11-20 21:09:16	Yoshi2	it's not a bad idea
2014-11-20 21:09:23	@J	*it's the best idea
2014-11-20 21:09:26	@Espyo	hehe, yeah, it's a good idea
2014-11-20 21:09:30	@Espyo	but it's not the best idea NOW
2014-11-20 21:09:44	Yoshi2	my current code for playing or converting bms files is horridamn
2014-11-20 21:10:12	@J	if you have a library, your testing interface can be like 2 lines
2014-11-20 21:10:21	@J	it's not like it takes more work
2014-11-20 21:10:26	@J	down the line, it saves work
2014-11-20 21:10:34	@Espyo	J
2014-11-20 21:10:38	@Espyo	Yoshi2 is using windows
2014-11-20 21:10:39	@Espyo	trust me
2014-11-20 21:10:44	@Espyo	it is at least twice as much work
2014-11-20 21:11:10	@J	why would how you separate your code be OS-dependent?
2014-11-20 21:11:22	@Espyo	uh
2014-11-20 21:11:26	@Espyo	try that sentence again
2014-11-20 21:12:03	@J	not sure how
2014-11-20 21:12:26	Yoshi2	oh great, smartgit asks me to purchase it, but I'm pretty sure I chose the "Non-commercial use" option when I installed it
2014-11-20 21:12:41	@J	why would it take more work to separate your code properly on Windows?
2014-11-20 21:12:55	@J	Yoshi2: I suggest SourceTree
2014-11-20 21:13:07	@J	never used it, but I've heard recommendations
2014-11-20 21:13:08	@Espyo	what does "why would how" mean?
2014-11-20 21:13:19	@J	oh
2014-11-20 21:13:24	@Espyo	no, not the code separating part
2014-11-20 21:13:25	@J	-> why would the way in which
2014-11-20 21:13:28	@Espyo	the actual library part
2014-11-20 21:13:37	@Espyo	oh, makes sense now
2014-11-20 21:13:38	@J	in Python a library is a file
2014-11-20 21:13:40	@Espyo	it's just really weird
2014-11-20 21:13:45	@Espyo	...
2014-11-20 21:13:46	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-11-20 21:13:50	@Espyo	Python is a thing that exists
2014-11-20 21:13:53	@J	it just means put it in a separate file, and make it have a sensible interface
2014-11-20 21:13:54	@Espyo	err, carry on, I guess
2014-11-20 21:14:04	Yoshi2	I've heard some things about sourcetree, but I don't find smartgit to be too bad, I had more success with it on my desktop
2014-11-20 21:14:05	@Espyo	no, yeah
2014-11-20 21:14:09	@Espyo	no, that's a good idea, yes
2014-11-20 21:14:17	@J	yeah, I can see why you would reel back in horror at the thought of Windows DLLs
2014-11-20 21:14:18	@Espyo	it's just that I was going like the .dll route
2014-11-20 21:14:23	@Espyo	yes, exactly
2014-11-20 21:14:32	@Espyo	no, the way you guys are thinking is great, sure
2014-11-20 21:14:55	Yoshi2	Python makes me a happy person
2014-11-20 21:15:06	@Espyo	I bet
2014-11-20 21:15:16	@Espyo	there are so many git things out there
2014-11-20 21:15:17	@J	oh, I thought SourceTree was free (as in freedom), which was why I mentioned it
2014-11-20 21:15:19	@J	never mind then
2014-11-20 21:15:19	@Espyo	with gui
2014-11-20 21:15:24	@Espyo	and most are free
2014-11-20 21:15:32	@Espyo	so I'm not sure how is it that you managed to stumble upon a paid one
2014-11-20 21:15:40	@Espyo	I use GitExtensions
2014-11-20 21:15:57	@Espyo	then again, I have GitExtensions because it connects with visual studio nicely (a miracle)
2014-11-20 21:15:59	@J	TBH the command-line is better once you learn it anyway
2014-11-20 21:16:02	Yoshi2	smartgit is actually free if you use it non-commercially, but I think it has a one month testing period if you choose the paid option
2014-11-20 21:16:09	@J	it depends how much you expect to be using Git
2014-11-20 21:16:11	@Espyo	not quite sure how it handles by itself
2014-11-20 21:16:16	@Espyo	eh, Git by itself is pretty simple
2014-11-20 21:16:27	@J	in general, the more you use something, the more of an advantage the command-line version will have
2014-11-20 21:16:27	@Espyo	so this isn't really one of those things were command line massively overpowers gui, or vice-versa
2014-11-20 21:16:34	@J	it really is
2014-11-20 21:16:37	@J	Git is huge
2014-11-20 21:16:41	@Espyo	is not
2014-11-20 21:16:48	@Espyo	for scrippting, command line is great, but
2014-11-20 21:16:57	@Espyo	why in the world would you need to batch something this simple
2014-11-20 21:17:07	@J	it's not simple at all
2014-11-20 21:17:13	@J	maybe for one person
2014-11-20 21:17:18	@Espyo	yes, it's what I mean
2014-11-20 21:17:24	@J	but with multiple developers, multiple branches, merges...
2014-11-20 21:17:25	@Espyo	something THIS simple
2014-11-20 21:17:27	@Espyo	current scenario
2014-11-20 21:17:29	@Espyo	oh, definitely
2014-11-20 21:17:30	@J	yeah
2014-11-20 21:17:33	@J	that's what I was saying
2014-11-20 21:17:36	@J	the more you use it
2014-11-20 21:17:39	@Espyo	right
2014-11-20 21:17:42	@J	as in the more fully you use it
2014-11-20 21:17:47	@Espyo	right, but I was referring to just Yoshi2, really
2014-11-20 21:17:59	@J	okay
2014-11-20 21:18:13	Yoshi2	this is one of the few cases where I like a program with a gui more than the command line version
2014-11-20 21:18:27	@J	yeah, the only Git script I have at home is to package the repository in an archive
2014-11-20 21:18:28	@Espyo	yeah, just two or three buttons can send a commit
2014-11-20 21:18:33	@Espyo	that's less than 30+ keypresses
2014-11-20 21:18:40	@Espyo	...thanks, windows
2014-11-20 21:18:50	@Espyo	you know that uh... quick list for folders I visited?
2014-11-20 21:18:53	@Espyo	that has no rhyme or reason
2014-11-20 21:19:02	@J	you know you can't compare keyboard/mouse like that
2014-11-20 21:19:07	@Espyo	it kept for this last month a folder I visited ONCE
2014-11-20 21:19:17	@Espyo	and another folder I visited twice, and wanted to go to again got removed
2014-11-20 21:19:18	Yoshi2	I can also see which files I changed, I can check older commits in a pretty tree representation, I can see file differences
2014-11-20 21:19:27	@Espyo	oranges and apples, yes
2014-11-20 21:19:40	@Espyo	but even still, typing speed and mouse aiming+clicking speed are things you can measure
2014-11-20 21:19:42	@Espyo	to some degree
2014-11-20 21:19:49	@Espyo	still faster to click commit and ok than typing
2014-11-20 21:19:54	@Espyo	even with tab-completion taken into account
2014-11-20 21:19:55	@J	yeah, obviously you can do that stuff on the command-line, so again it's just how much you use it
2014-11-20 21:20:06	@Espyo	yeah, that's command-line too
2014-11-20 21:20:08	@J	it is really useful to start off with a GUI with something like this, though
2014-11-20 21:20:19	@J	helps with visualisation early on
2014-11-20 21:20:27	@Espyo	true, though it doesn't look much like Yoshi2 is starting on Git
2014-11-20 21:20:36	@J	[21:19:49] @Espyo still faster to click commit and ok than typing
2014-11-20 21:20:40	@J	depends on your workflow
2014-11-20 21:20:50	@J	if you _really_ want, you can map that to a one-letter command anyway
2014-11-20 21:20:58	@Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2014-11-20 21:21:00	@Espyo	good point
2014-11-20 21:21:09	@J	the time spent typing the commit message is the same either way
2014-11-20 21:21:15	@Espyo	that is, yes
2014-11-20 21:21:18	@Espyo	I think in times like these
2014-11-20 21:21:37	@Espyo	calculating the time it takes to move the right hand out of the keyboard and onto the mouse should also be taken into account
2014-11-20 21:21:43	@Espyo	and vice-versa
2014-11-20 21:21:47	@J	yeah
2014-11-20 21:21:57	@Espyo	the probability of having your right hand on something that isn't the thing you're going to use can probably be calculated
2014-11-20 21:22:01	@J	OTOH, if your commit button has an access key, it's just alt+key
2014-11-20 21:22:14	@Espyo	yes, but that's an if
2014-11-20 21:22:19	@Espyo	a surprising number of windows applications don't
2014-11-20 21:22:24	@J	yeah, it's sad
2014-11-20 21:22:36	@Espyo	at least menus normally have them
2014-11-20 21:22:41	@J	but it's best to compare well-made GUI vs. well-made CLI
2014-11-20 21:22:52	@Espyo	it's hard to make a badly-made CLI
2014-11-20 21:23:00	@Espyo	harder than badly-made GUI, at any rate
2014-11-20 21:23:06	@J	it's really not
2014-11-20 21:23:24	@J	skip tab completion and documentation and it's already unusable
2014-11-20 21:23:26	@Espyo	all right, here's the way I see it
2014-11-20 21:23:32	@Espyo	you can make a CLI much more unusable
2014-11-20 21:23:36	@Espyo	than a GUI
2014-11-20 21:23:38	@J	at least GUI is sort of self-documenting
2014-11-20 21:23:41	@Espyo	but to do so, you have to do stuff no sensible human would
2014-11-20 21:23:54	@J	no, you have to _not_ do stuff
2014-11-20 21:24:03	@J	and we all know how easy it is to do nothing
2014-11-20 21:24:07	@Espyo	I was thinking more along the lines of convoluted menus
2014-11-20 21:24:22	@Espyo	hey, actual question this time
2014-11-20 21:24:25	@Espyo	you mentioned tab completion
2014-11-20 21:24:29	@J	mm, yeah, those are annoying
2014-11-20 21:24:37	@J	but searchable menus are the best thing
2014-11-20 21:24:44	@Espyo	how much of a thing is tab completion for a program's parameters?
2014-11-20 21:24:46	@J	every part of every GUI should have searching
2014-11-20 21:24:47	@Espyo	that don't involve paths
2014-11-20 21:24:54	@J	depends how good it is
2014-11-20 21:25:06	@Espyo	like, I know stuff like apt-get is incredible with this
2014-11-20 21:25:21	@J	for example, git completes branches, remotes, relevant paths (eg. it won't complete already-added files with 'git add')
2014-11-20 21:25:23	@Espyo	but is there really such a thing as feeding the OS a list of stuff that can fall as parameters?
2014-11-20 21:25:37	@J	with the right setup, scp can complete paths on remote machines
2014-11-20 21:25:52	@J	it's actually even better: many shells have programmable completion
2014-11-20 21:25:59	@J	the completion is driven from a custom script
2014-11-20 21:26:03	@Espyo	that's pretty amazing
2014-11-20 21:26:35	@J	some programs complete options too (-x and --thing)
2014-11-20 21:26:51	@Espyo	right, that's mostly what I meant
2014-11-20 21:28:25	@J	pacman, my package manager, will complete remote packages, local packages, files, options, etc. depending on the context
2014-11-20 21:28:40	@Espyo	neat
2014-11-20 21:29:05	@J	and file completion is context-dependent, eg. passing it a package from a file will only complete files like *.pkg.*
2014-11-20 21:29:26	@J	so yeah, it can be really quite intelligent
2014-11-20 21:29:26	@Espyo	right
2014-11-20 21:31:52	@J	oh, so yeah, I was going to say earlier - kind of related: after trying to write command-line applications in various other languages, I've realised just how good the built-in Python library is for that (optparse/argparse)
2014-11-20 21:32:03	@J	other implementations are just so limited
2014-11-20 21:32:30	@J	many just try to determine the options they get and then give you them all, and you have to do the validation yourself
2014-11-20 21:32:56	@J	predefining the options is much more effective
2014-11-20 21:33:13	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-11-20 23:07:04	@Espyo	I'll upload the KopPad theme on the wiki
2014-11-20 23:07:10	@Espyo	it's the most hands-on way to get feedback
2014-11-20 23:07:16	@Espyo	can we do it, or do we need Porple for this?

2014-11-20 23:32:21	@Espyo	I've changed code in the engine
2014-11-20 23:32:27	@Espyo	the line references don't match up any more
2014-11-20 23:34:53	@Espyo	all right, updated the code
2014-11-20 23:46:11	@J	can't create a new skin without server-side changes

2014-11-20 23:48:10	@Espyo	it's fewer

2014-11-20 23:48:31	@J	what's actually wrong with the way you're using max, and why does it work for you?

2014-11-21 19:36:54	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2014-11-21 19:40:20	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-21 20:15:14	@J	hello
2014-11-21 20:22:05	@Espyo	so, about yesterday
2014-11-21 20:22:09	@Espyo	there was this glitch on Testyo
2014-11-21 20:22:10	Testyo	well i best on the PP
2014-11-21 20:22:13	@Espyo	...or microsoft, more like
2014-11-21 20:22:25	@Espyo	where outputting data to a text file just writes a bunch of NULLs
2014-11-21 20:22:35	@Espyo	and Testyo saves on text files a lot of times
2014-11-21 20:22:36	Testyo	You been in Great Britain since both of them took a WHOLE lot of time to do
2014-11-21 20:22:53	@Espyo	I caught it happening a couple of times, and was able to go fetch backups from Dropbox
2014-11-21 20:22:55	@Espyo	didn't lose anything
2014-11-21 20:22:59	@Espyo	...but those were the user records
2014-11-21 20:23:07	@Espyo	I didn't check some other files that got affected too
2014-11-21 20:23:16	@Espyo	and it's too late to fetch any salvageable backups now
2014-11-21 20:23:21	@Espyo	meaning the word records are destroyed
2014-11-21 20:23:34	@Espyo	also Testyo keeps a list of messages he randomly saves from our conversations, in order to make random messages
2014-11-21 20:23:36	Testyo	I wouldn't mind Brawl too much, but it doesn't want to indent
2014-11-21 20:23:37	@Espyo	those got corrupted too
2014-11-21 20:23:43	@Espyo	but he's always renewing them, so meh
2014-11-21 20:23:48	@Espyo	but the word records...
2014-11-21 20:23:59	@Espyo	it's not one of the biggest losses, but
2014-11-21 20:24:06	@Espyo	on another network, we had a swear counter
2014-11-21 20:24:13	@Espyo	we were gonna calculate how many swears per year
2014-11-21 20:24:28	@Espyo	as well as some catchphrases some of us didn't even know we had until the word counters reported high numbers
2014-11-21 20:24:29	@Espyo	but it's all gone
2014-11-21 20:24:34	@Espyo	anyway, bottom line
2014-11-21 20:24:38	@Espyo	I tried searching on Google
2014-11-21 20:24:43	@Espyo	and this is just...
2014-11-21 20:24:45	@Espyo	makes no sense
2014-11-21 20:24:53	@Espyo	it's just a thing that happened to like 2 people in the history of C++
2014-11-21 20:24:55	@Espyo	me and some other guy
2014-11-21 20:24:57	@Espyo	and it's random and rare
2014-11-21 20:25:05	@Espyo	looks like just a random write error

2014-11-21 21:23:10	@J	you don't have backups?
2014-11-21 21:23:16	@J	I am ashamed
2014-11-21 21:29:02	@Espyo	I
2014-11-21 21:29:03	@Espyo	just said I did
2014-11-21 21:29:13	@Espyo	but Dropbox only keeps backups for 30 days
2014-11-21 21:29:16	@Espyo	I make backups once a week
2014-11-21 21:29:17	Testyo	Espyo is flooding!
2014-11-21 21:29:21	@Espyo	surprisingly, I use scripts for it
2014-11-21 21:29:26	@J	hmm
2014-11-21 21:29:27	@Espyo	yeah, batch scripts, on windows
2014-11-21 21:29:33	@J	you have insufficient backups, then
2014-11-21 21:29:36	@Espyo	it took me like 3 months to get the scripts to work, but damn, they do
2014-11-21 21:29:42	@Espyo	yes, they're insufficient
2014-11-21 21:29:45	@Espyo	but think about it
2014-11-21 21:29:46	Testyo	Espyo is a flooder!
2014-11-21 21:29:50	@J	...
2014-11-21 21:29:50	Testyo	J is a flooder!
2014-11-21 21:29:54	@Espyo	why do I even keep backups of this to be--

2014-11-21 21:29:58	@Espyo	--gin with?
2014-11-21 21:30:03	@Espyo	they're just Testyo's files
2014-11-21 21:30:12	@Espyo	a single week-old backup is enough
2014-11-21 21:30:19	@Espyo	so keeping month-old backups is more than what's needed
2014-11-21 21:30:27	@Espyo	and I could never predict a bug like THIS
2014-11-21 21:30:37	@J	hmm
2014-11-21 21:30:47	@J	I prefer to stay on the safe side
2014-11-21 21:30:59	@J	making such a script save for a year rather than a month is easy
2014-11-21 21:31:07	@J	and it's not like it'll fill your disk
2014-11-21 21:31:52	@Espyo	eh
2014-11-21 21:32:01	@Espyo	but it's so minor
2014-11-21 21:32:11	@Espyo	plus making a script to save stuff to like a year could be a bit easy
2014-11-21 21:32:16	@J	hey, you were the one complaining just now
2014-11-21 21:32:21	@Espyo	not worth it most of the time, but worth it for that 0.1% of the time
2014-11-21 21:32:23	@Espyo	but on windows?
2014-11-21 21:32:32	@Espyo	I'm already lucky the current scripts aren't formatting my hard drive
2014-11-21 21:32:43	@Espyo	I was, but the backups aren't really a fix to the problem
2014-11-21 21:32:45	@Espyo	they're just an aside
2014-11-21 21:33:02	@J	oh, when you say you keep backups for a week, you mean just one backup, each week, that overwrites the previous backup?
2014-11-21 21:33:15	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-21 21:33:18	@Espyo	yeah, it gets confusing
2014-11-21 21:33:23	@Espyo	all right, here's how it works
2014-11-21 21:33:33	@Espyo	every saturday, the script runs and grabs Testyo's databases
2014-11-21 21:33:43	@Espyo	it places it on a folder of backups, on my Dropbox
2014-11-21 21:33:49	@Espyo	that folder has backups of loads of misc. things
2014-11-21 21:34:04	@Espyo	so there's only one backup on my physical hard drive
2014-11-21 21:34:11	@Espyo	but every change that happens to a file gets mirrored to Dropbox
2014-11-21 21:34:20	@Espyo	so when this backup happens, it gets sent to Dropbox too
2014-11-21 21:34:24	@Espyo	Dropbox, besides saving your file
2014-11-21 21:34:31	@Espyo	also saves all edited versions, up to a month
2014-11-21 21:34:35	@Espyo	so physically, I have one backup
2014-11-21 21:34:43	@Espyo	but on the Dropbox site I always have 4 or 5 backups
2014-11-21 21:34:47	@J	hmm, okay
2014-11-21 21:34:57	@J	do backups count towards your quota on Dropbox?
2014-11-21 21:34:57	@Espyo	they could keep infinite backups, but that's only for paid accounts
2014-11-21 21:35:04	@Espyo	everything does
2014-11-21 21:35:12	@Espyo	oh, wait
2014-11-21 21:35:16	@Espyo	if version differences count?
2014-11-21 21:35:18	@Espyo	they don't, surprisingly
2014-11-21 21:35:22	@Espyo	at least, I'm pretty sure they don't
2014-11-21 21:35:31	@Espyo	Dropbox says I'm using 2GB of space

2014-11-21 21:35:35	@Espyo	and my Dropbox folder is 2GB
2014-11-21 21:35:36	@J	yeah, they shouldn't, because it would be confusing
2014-11-21 21:35:46	@Espyo	and my folder doesn't save the changed versions, so...
2014-11-21 21:35:49	@J	how would you choose between storing new stuff and not removing backups?
2014-11-21 21:35:50	@Espyo	confusing and kind of unfair
2014-11-21 21:35:56	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-21 21:38:02	@Espyo	anyway, loads of things could make Testyo save the file incorrectly
2014-11-21 21:38:06	@Espyo	concurrent uses...
2014-11-21 21:38:08	@Espyo	uh
2014-11-21 21:38:15	@Espyo	I guess never mind that one, only Testyo accesses the file
2014-11-21 21:38:22	@Espyo	oh, maybe windows might, to do random system stuff?
2014-11-21 21:38:39	@Espyo	anyway, I can't think of anything that instead of denying access to the file, instead makes the save output 0 bytes

2014-11-22 12:26:41	Yoshi2	I said "hey Testyo"
2014-11-22 12:28:11	Yoshi2	I managed to fix my issue with smartgit, I had to delete a specific directory for that
2014-11-22 12:28:44	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-22 12:28:47	@Espyo	that was before I logged in then

2014-11-22 12:29:07	@Espyo	weird that registration-like things are in a folder like that
2014-11-22 12:30:00	Yoshi2	my other guess would've been the registry, but I found nothing
2014-11-22 12:30:10	Yoshi2	it is good that this kind of stuff is not saved in the registry
2014-11-22 12:32:26	Yoshi2	I also finally set up the client so that I could push my commits
2014-11-22 12:32:41	Yoshi2	I was at ~11 unpushed commits or so
2014-11-22 12:44:32	@Espyo	right
2014-11-22 12:45:02	@Espyo	also Testyo's offline because I made it so he reported corrupted files
2014-11-22 12:45:07	@Espyo	and because I didn't fix the ones that are corrupted
2014-11-22 12:45:21	@Espyo	and because he checks a LOT of the files for every single message sent — even server log in and status and whatnot
2014-11-22 12:45:25	@Espyo	he was reporting a LOT of errors
2014-11-22 12:45:30	@Espyo	tired of having the window flash
2014-11-22 12:45:36	@Espyo	I'll fix it later today and put him online then
2014-11-22 12:52:58	Yoshi2	that sounds like a good idea
2014-11-22 12:54:16	@Espyo	hm, unless I was sleepy yesterday, I could swear he was also reporting errors for files that were working fine
2014-11-22 12:54:25	@Espyo	because of course nothing can ever work right the first time
2014-11-22 13:29:07	Yoshi2	a while ago I've noticed that I am more likely to write code that actually runs for the first time without exceptions
2014-11-22 13:29:27	Yoshi2	but there are hidden errors that I stumble upon that don't actually cause exceptions
2014-11-22 13:30:12	@Espyo	tbh, I've been noticing that happening to me too

2014-11-22 13:41:42	Yoshi2	hello
2014-11-22 13:52:11	Klemen702	i have a bit funny but a bit pointless story while playing pikmin if anyone wants to hear
2014-11-22 13:55:35	Yoshi2	sure, if you want to tell it
2014-11-22 13:56:00	Klemen702	ah ok
2014-11-22 13:56:09	Klemen702	so i was playing on i think day 6
2014-11-22 13:56:23	Klemen702	i was in the forest of hope and i had about 100 blue pikmin
2014-11-22 13:56:36	Klemen702	now you know how the landing site is protected by some sort of barrier
2014-11-22 13:57:24	Klemen702	well when i was at the landing site i checked if all of my pikmin are here, so once the end of the day cutscene started everything was normal
2014-11-22 13:58:16	Yoshi2	ah, in Pikmin 1?
2014-11-22 13:58:30	Klemen702	once all of the pikmin were in the onion and Olimar was in the circle at the dolphin, for some reason, a blue pikmin came while from the destroyed gate once everyone was in the onion
2014-11-22 13:59:00	Klemen702	it was kinda funny, but a bit strange
2014-11-22 13:59:10	Klemen702	it didn't count as left behind do
2014-11-22 14:00:41	Yoshi2	maybe the game becomes a bit funny with huge amounts of Pikmin
2014-11-22 14:00:41	Klemen702	infact, i had the end of the day cutscene multiple times with 97 pikmin in my squad (the other 3 were from where i tried to make them carry me) but this exact moment never happened
2014-11-22 14:00:49	Klemen702	yeah i guess
2014-11-22 14:01:26	Klemen702	im pretty sure it was also a leaf
2014-11-22 14:01:31	Yoshi2	in the Bingo mode of Pikmin 3 I've had pikmin fight eachother and then become ghost-like
2014-11-22 14:01:59	Klemen702	what do you mean by that?
2014-11-22 14:02:19	Yoshi2	after a bit of fighting they would just stand around for a short time before disappearing
2014-11-22 14:02:45	Yoshi2	it only happened when fighting the Pikmin of the enemy player though
2014-11-22 14:03:24	Klemen702	weird
2014-11-22 14:03:37	Klemen702	were the pikmin the same color?
2014-11-22 14:05:48	Klemen702	as in, the pikmin that fought each other
2014-11-22 14:05:54	Yoshi2	I think so, my own red Pikmin fought against the red Pikmin of the person that played with me
2014-11-22 14:06:45	Klemen702	well that kind of makes sense in a way
2014-11-22 14:08:43	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-22 14:09:09	Klemen702	hi
2014-11-22 14:09:31	@Espyo	hm, that is kinda weird
2014-11-22 14:11:26	Klemen702	prehaps, because the pikmin were the same type but different teams attacking each other, the game got confused on which one is alive or not so it left them there
2014-11-22 14:11:53	Yoshi2	there is probably some sort of issue with synchronization
2014-11-22 14:11:58	Klemen702	until some sort of counter decreased and so they dissapeared
2014-11-22 14:14:19	Yoshi2	the Bingo mode is the only mode that allows pikmin to fight each other, so maybe they weren't so concerned about this issue
2014-11-22 14:14:30	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-22 14:23:05	Yoshi2	maybe they even planned to add an online mode, but I'm not sure how probable that would be
2014-11-22 14:23:20	@Espyo	not improbable, really
2014-11-22 14:24:26	@Espyo	yes, c++
2014-11-22 14:24:37	@Espyo	because a string with three 0 bytes is an empty string
2014-11-22 14:26:43	@Espyo	.............
2014-11-22 14:26:49	@Espyo	"\0\0\0" doesn't work
2014-11-22 14:26:56	@Espyo	but creating a string object and putting a "\0" element does
2014-11-22 14:27:02	@Espyo	hm, though I guess it makes sense
2014-11-22 14:27:08	@Espyo	I was sending a string as a C string
2014-11-22 14:27:12	@Espyo	and C strings are \0 terminated
2014-11-22 14:27:15	@Espyo	meaning I was sending nothing
2014-11-22 14:27:20	@Espyo	STL strings are the ones that allow \0

2014-11-22 16:10:44	@Espyo	uuuuuuggh...
2014-11-22 16:10:46	@J	wait, maybe it did
2014-11-22 16:10:48	@Espyo	it's just a bloody constant
2014-11-22 16:11:01	@Espyo	#define max(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
2014-11-22 16:11:03	@Espyo	that's all there is to it
2014-11-22 16:12:53	@J	no, it didn't work
2014-11-22 16:13:27	@J	for some reason that error doesn't show up after a 'make clean', but I don't think we can take that to mean anything when there are so many errors
2014-11-22 16:14:44	@Espyo	there're only errors about max
2014-11-22 16:14:46	@Espyo	the rest are notes
2014-11-22 16:14:48	@Espyo	also about max
2014-11-22 16:14:52	@Espyo	also strangely nothing about min
2014-11-22 16:15:55	@J	maybe it's type mismatches
2014-11-22 16:16:00	@J	like you're calling it with a float and an int
2014-11-22 16:16:19	@J	I think lots of errors are skipped when similar errors are around

2014-11-22 16:18:55	@Espyo	it's only complaining about some constants now
2014-11-22 16:19:00	@Espyo	all right, we can tell those constants what they should be
2014-11-22 16:19:06	@Espyo	I'll change my code to use normal variable constants

2014-11-22 16:28:49	@Espyo	mine's just using a preprocessor define

2014-11-22 16:28:59	@J	it's trying to use all the ones it lists

2014-11-22 16:29:20	@J	where's it meant to come from?
2014-11-22 16:30:32	@Espyo	apparently, stdlib.h
2014-11-22 16:32:12	@Espyo	guess I'll go with the one on algorithm.h
2014-11-22 16:32:14	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/stdlib.h
2014-11-22 16:32:22	@Espyo	even though it's probably slower
2014-11-22 16:32:25	@Espyo	because it's an actual function call
2014-11-22 16:32:56	@Espyo	all right, cool
2014-11-22 16:33:00	@Espyo	stdlib.h doesn't even match

2014-11-22 16:34:18	@Espyo	now to force it to actually use the max and min on std

2014-11-22 16:38:04	@Espyo	looks like #undef max worked

2014-11-22 16:43:53	@Espyo	what were the instructions you found?
2014-11-22 16:45:49	@Espyo	oh, wait
2014-11-22 16:45:51	@Espyo	looks like this worked
2014-11-22 16:49:55	@J	they were instructions for adding NOMINMAX as a header for the project, within VS project settings
2014-11-22 16:49:58	@J	ie. no code

2014-11-22 16:57:52	@Espyo	yep, that's what I did
2014-11-22 16:59:28	@Espyo	anyway, it worked
2014-11-22 17:02:59	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/scientific%20method.mkv
2014-11-22 17:03:05	@J	almost finished, just have to add some easter eggs
2014-11-22 17:03:59	@Espyo	the music gets more intense as you move, huh?
2014-11-22 17:04:07	@J	no?
2014-11-22 17:04:46	@J	I mean, there's nothing dynamic there, it just plays the same way every time
2014-11-22 17:05:03	@J	except for some volume triggers
2014-11-22 17:05:10	@Espyo	could've been volume
2014-11-22 17:05:29	@Espyo	yep, it's just volume
2014-11-22 17:05:36	@Espyo	I like it, though I think it could use more lab-like things at times
2014-11-22 17:05:40	@Espyo	like plain old computers, if possible
2014-11-22 17:05:44	@Espyo	or just some machines of whateverness
2014-11-22 17:06:07	@J	yeah, there's some of that stuff I could use
2014-11-22 17:06:12	@Espyo	the climb at :19 struck me as particularly slow and dull
2014-11-22 17:06:25	@Espyo	maybe the corridor is just TOO simple
2014-11-22 17:06:31	@Espyo	not everything can have detail, otherwise it gets saturated
2014-11-22 17:06:35	@J	although I kind of like it feeling empty
2014-11-22 17:06:43	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-22 17:06:48	@Espyo	but of all parts you chose not to add detail, it had to be a really slow corridor
2014-11-22 17:07:08	@J	of course, when you're playing, you're paying less attention to the background
2014-11-22 17:07:13	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-22 17:07:26	@Espyo	but it really does make a world of difference
2014-11-22 17:07:29	@J	I guess because the camera zooms in there, so you don't see anything else
2014-11-22 17:07:51	@J	I'll try sticking stuff there, maybe just another window
2014-11-22 17:08:45	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-22 17:10:30	@J	but yeah, just adding very simple backgrounds really improves the feel of it
2014-11-22 17:10:37	@J	and music
2014-11-22 17:11:15	@Espyo	it really does
2014-11-22 17:11:25	@Espyo	anyway, I've searched, and I THINK I covered it all
2014-11-22 17:11:33	@Espyo	I would bet an arm and a leg at how this isn't over
2014-11-22 17:11:49	@Espyo	I found a max(0, some_int + some_float);
2014-11-22 17:11:53	@Espyo	and it didn't complain about that
2014-11-22 17:11:58	@Espyo	rather, it did complain, intellisense did
2014-11-22 17:12:00	@Espyo	but the compile didn't
2014-11-22 17:12:08	@Espyo	intellisense = squiggly lines under things that will go wrong
2014-11-22 17:12:18	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2014-11-22 17:12:39	@J	hmm
2014-11-22 17:13:05	@J	I did see some other errors, but ignored them
2014-11-22 17:13:19	@J	sometimes errors go away when you fix others
2014-11-22 17:14:38	@Espyo	https://github.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine try it now
2014-11-22 17:14:48	@Espyo	I did add a... whatever it is you might call it
2014-11-22 17:14:50	@Espyo	to all constants
2014-11-22 17:14:56	@Espyo	so that probably fixed a bunch of them
2014-11-22 17:15:02	@Espyo	you know, the .0f and all
2014-11-22 17:15:03	Testyo	0 F = -17.7778 °C / 255.372 K
2014-11-22 17:19:19	@J	Source/area_editor.cpp:96:24: error: no matching function for call to 'load_bmp'
2014-11-22 17:19:19	@J	        ed_bg_bitmap = load_bmp(new_file_name, false);
2014-11-22 17:19:26	@J	Source/functions.h:97:20: note: candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'bool' to 'data_node *' for 2nd argument

2014-11-22 17:19:31	@J	that's the only error now
2014-11-22 17:20:16	@J	Allegro version is 5.0.10
2014-11-22 17:22:38	@Espyo	 5.0.10 here too
2014-11-22 17:22:45	@J	hmm, interesting
2014-11-22 17:23:11	@J	oh, it's your function
2014-11-22 17:23:36	@J	I don't see how this could possibly work for you
2014-11-22 17:24:38	@J	it's clearly an error - don't tell me VS casts false to NULL
2014-11-22 17:24:44	@Espyo	false = 0
2014-11-22 17:24:45	@Espyo	NULL = 0
2014-11-22 17:25:43	@J	they have different types, though
2014-11-22 17:25:57	@Espyo	it's in implicit cast
2014-11-22 17:26:08	@Espyo	it should REALLY get some sort of special case
2014-11-22 17:26:12	@J	but
2014-11-22 17:26:17	@J	false is a bool, NULL is for pointers
2014-11-22 17:26:19	@Espyo	"hey man, this conversion is possible, but I'm VERY SURE you don't want to do this"
2014-11-22 17:26:23	@J	such a cast makes no sense
2014-11-22 17:26:23	@Espyo	instead, it just lets me do it
2014-11-22 17:26:29	@Espyo	of course not, but it's possible
2014-11-22 17:26:38	@Espyo	a false can be cast to an int, 0
2014-11-22 17:26:44	@J	did you mean to do that, anyway?
2014-11-22 17:26:47	@Espyo	and it knows a pointer can be 0, so it lets me
2014-11-22 17:26:49	@Espyo	I didn't
2014-11-22 17:26:50	@J	or was it meant to be the 3rd argument
2014-11-22 17:26:51	@J	?
2014-11-22 17:26:52	@Espyo	must've been old code
2014-11-22 17:27:01	@Espyo	where the 2nd argument used to be a bool
2014-11-22 17:27:02	@Espyo	oh, or that
2014-11-22 17:27:05	@Espyo	lemme check
2014-11-22 17:27:18	@Espyo	that was very likely it, yes
2014-11-22 17:27:22	@Espyo	good thing you found it
2014-11-22 17:27:39	@Espyo	well, yeah, it's (new_file_name, NULL, false), in the end
2014-11-22 17:28:25	@J	NULL actually isn't defined to be 0 in C
2014-11-22 17:28:58	@J	looks like you added both around the same time, actually (call and definition)
2014-11-22 17:29:17	@J	committed around the same time, anyway
2014-11-22 17:29:19	@Espyo	NULL is just a C++ thing
2014-11-22 17:29:29	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-22 17:29:34	@J	no, it exists in C, it's just not 0
2014-11-22 17:29:36	@Espyo	probably that, then
2014-11-22 17:29:38	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-22 17:29:40	@Espyo	then what? 0x0?
2014-11-22 17:29:44	@J	I mean, it usually is, but isn't defined to be 0
2014-11-22 17:29:51	@J	as in you can't assume it's a number at all
2014-11-22 17:29:54	@Espyo	ah
2014-11-22 17:29:55	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-22 17:30:06	@Espyo	it's just that there's no true or false in C
2014-11-22 17:30:07	@Espyo	nor bools
2014-11-22 17:30:15	@J	yeah
2014-11-22 17:30:15	@Espyo	so you just make a single byte, and give it 0 or 1
2014-11-22 17:30:20	@Espyo	normally with #defines for FALSE and TRUE
2014-11-22 17:30:25	@Espyo	so yeah, big mess
2014-11-22 17:30:28	@Espyo	luckily it got solved
2014-11-22 17:30:36	@Espyo	I'm VERY sure I don't want to report an error on the area editor...
2014-11-22 17:30:39	@Espyo	yeah, I don't
2014-11-22 17:30:42	@J	0 and 1 as booleans isn't that bad
2014-11-22 17:30:47	@Espyo	errors are for when something in the game's files are wrong
2014-11-22 17:30:53	@Espyo	no, it's not bad
2014-11-22 17:30:53	@J	it's simple and has a clear definition
2014-11-22 17:30:56	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-22 17:34:53	@J	functions.cpp:895 has a min
2014-11-22 17:36:05	@J	http://sprunge.us/gJYS and more stuff
2014-11-22 17:36:22	@J	that constant is weird
2014-11-22 17:40:32	@Espyo	why
2014-11-22 17:40:33	@Espyo	why
2014-11-22 17:40:43	@Espyo	did windows just told me it could open functions.cpp:895 as a url
2014-11-22 17:40:48	@J	I don't really get the make_pair part
2014-11-22 17:40:48	@Espyo	hah, I guess it makes sense
2014-11-22 17:40:54	@Espyo	site and port
2014-11-22 17:43:27	@Espyo	all right, make_pair creates a pair object
2014-11-22 17:43:33	@Espyo	that takes two template classes
2014-11-22 17:43:42	@Espyo	in this case, I can create a float/sector pointer pair
2014-11-22 17:45:22	@J	yeah, I get that
2014-11-22 17:45:37	@Espyo	I'm really not sure what the problem is
2014-11-22 17:45:42	@Espyo	try a cast to float
2014-11-22 17:45:43	@Espyo	on... the float
2014-11-22 17:45:51	@Espyo	make_pair<float, sector*>((float) (n->second), n->first)
2014-11-22 17:46:26	@Espyo	also functions.cpp:895, put this:
2014-11-22 17:46:27	@Espyo	min((double) (dist / delta_t / 2.0f), (double) speed);
2014-11-22 17:47:34	@Espyo	on functions.cpp:566, replace the string::npos with 255
2014-11-22 17:47:45	@J	it's not casting to float, it's casting to 'float &&'
2014-11-22 17:47:53	@Espyo	yeah, which means...
2014-11-22 17:47:57	@Espyo	you know, I'm not even SURE what it means
2014-11-22 17:47:58	@J	I looked it up, and it's some C++11 thing to do with modifiability
2014-11-22 17:48:04	@Espyo	...
2014-11-22 17:48:12	@Espyo	can you cast it to (float &&)?
2014-11-22 17:49:16	@J	neighbors_vec.push_back(make_pair<float, sector*>((float &&)n->second, (sector*)n->first));
2014-11-22 17:49:19	@J	magically works?
2014-11-22 17:49:24	@J	I don't even know why
2014-11-22 17:49:31	@Espyo	do you need the cast to sector pointer?
2014-11-22 17:49:35	@J	you should probably read up on it
2014-11-22 17:49:36	@J	yeah, I do
2014-11-22 17:49:41	@Espyo	this is insane
2014-11-22 17:49:45	@J	/usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.9.2/../../../../include/c++/4.9.2/bits/stl_pair.h:276:5: note: 
2014-11-22 17:49:46	@J	      candidate function [with _T1 = float, _T2 = sector *] not viable: 2nd argument ('sector *const') would lose
2014-11-22 17:49:46	@J	      const qualifier
2014-11-22 17:49:51	@J	yes, C++ is
2014-11-22 17:50:03	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-22 17:50:05	@J	so it works
2014-11-22 17:50:22	@J	how do I FPS
2014-11-22 17:50:29	@Espyo	well, the internet is usless
2014-11-22 17:50:31	@Espyo	*useless
2014-11-22 17:50:34	@Espyo	press F1 to FPS
2014-11-22 17:50:40	@Espyo	you'll probably get 30
2014-11-22 17:50:43	@J	it seems like a really complicated concept
2014-11-22 17:50:49	@Espyo	a green 30
2014-11-22 17:50:54	@J	and it's probably worth understanding if you want to be a C++ programmer
2014-11-22 17:50:57	@J	yeah, 30
2014-11-22 17:51:03	@Espyo	I actually meant that the internet is useless in that I can't even FIND the subject
2014-11-22 17:51:08	@J	ah
2014-11-22 17:51:09	@Espyo	go on Options.txt on the root of the game
2014-11-22 17:51:15	@J	search 'rvalue reference'
2014-11-22 17:51:15	@Espyo	line...
2014-11-22 17:51:21	@Espyo	uh, like 8 lines from the bottom
2014-11-22 17:51:24	@Espyo	you should find fps=30
2014-11-22 17:51:30	@Espyo	set it to like 3000 just to make sure there's no cap
2014-11-22 17:52:02	@J	...it sets it back to 34464 in the file?
2014-11-22 17:52:05	@J	random number
2014-11-22 17:52:15	@J	game only shows 60 though
2014-11-22 17:52:30	@J	wait, if the window isn't on-screen, it goes up
2014-11-22 17:52:42	@J	hah, that's great
2014-11-22 17:52:51	@Espyo	that's... really weird
2014-11-22 17:52:53	@J	if it's visible, it gets locked to 60, and CPU usage is minimal
2014-11-22 17:53:03	@J	when not visible, CPU usage is 100% and I get ~1600FPS
2014-11-22 17:53:15	@Espyo	wot
2014-11-22 17:53:38	@Espyo	what if you set it to 3005? do you get 65 FPS?
2014-11-22 17:53:56	@J	I set it to 1000000 or so and the game set it back to 34464
2014-11-22 17:54:03	@Espyo	too big
2014-11-22 17:54:04	@J	actually wrote that value to the file
2014-11-22 17:54:07	@Espyo	it's just a short
2014-11-22 17:54:13	@J	32767 would make more sense
2014-11-22 17:54:21	@Espyo	it doesn't check
2014-11-22 17:54:23	@Espyo	so it just modulates
2014-11-22 17:54:33	@J	I mean, 32768 is a power of 2
2014-11-22 17:54:40	@Espyo	<whatever you put> % 32767 = 34464
2014-11-22 17:54:44	@Espyo	wait
2014-11-22 17:54:49	@J	...no
2014-11-22 17:54:53	@Espyo	uh, it's unsigned
2014-11-22 17:54:58	@Espyo	meaning 65 thousand something
2014-11-22 17:54:59	@J	oh, so 65536
2014-11-22 17:55:03	@Espyo	 65536, yep
2014-11-22 17:55:11	@J	okay, that adds up
2014-11-22 17:55:12	@J	weird
2014-11-22 17:55:16	@Espyo	so yeah, <whatever> % 65536 = 34464
2014-11-22 17:55:21	@Espyo	hence why I said 3000
2014-11-22 17:55:29	@Espyo	still, you getting 60fps is really weird
2014-11-22 17:55:31	@J	so 65536 would give me 0 or something
2014-11-22 17:55:35	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-22 17:55:40	@Espyo	probably a crash to go along with it, too
2014-11-22 17:56:03	@J	why did you think 3005 would give 65FPS?
2014-11-22 17:56:20	@Espyo	 3000 % 255 = 60
2014-11-22 17:56:26	@Espyo	in hindsight, no, it couldn't be that
2014-11-22 17:56:34	@Espyo	but hey, the commit could've gone wrong
2014-11-22 17:56:39	@Espyo	and still had the code where the framerate is a single byte
2014-11-22 17:56:45	@J	actually, 3005 gives me higher FPS when not visible than 34464
2014-11-22 17:56:50	@J	1800
2014-11-22 17:56:59	@Espyo	this is bonkers
2014-11-22 17:57:08	@Espyo	all right, let's try not insane asylum
2014-11-22 17:57:18	@J	but yeah, I think the 60FPS is actually the graphics card not bothering with more than 60 because that's the monitor refresh rate
2014-11-22 17:57:19	@Espyo	if you set the fps to, say, 48, do you get 48 in-game?
2014-11-22 17:57:28	@Espyo	I was gonna say that, but I went back with it
2014-11-22 17:57:32	@Espyo	because the game does not care
2014-11-22 17:57:36	@J	yeah, limiting works
2014-11-22 17:57:41	@Espyo	it can't refresh more than 60 times a second
2014-11-22 17:57:48	@Espyo	but it can calculate the ticks more than that
2014-11-22 17:57:54	@J	but you're waiting for vblank or something?
2014-11-22 17:57:59	@Espyo	waiting for nothing
2014-11-22 17:58:11	@Espyo	I just have a timer for 30, 60, or 3000 FPS, or what have you
2014-11-22 17:58:15	@J	there's a loop somewhere that says 'allegro, refresh the screen'
2014-11-22 17:58:16	@Espyo	and I just draw when possible
2014-11-22 17:58:25	@J	that call is going to block to keep it at 60FPS
2014-11-22 17:59:01	<--	Miles (Miles@h-47-72-682-095.hsd2.ga.comcast.net) has quit
2014-11-22 17:59:13	@J	ie. when you call it, the OpenGL implementation or the GPU driver or something says, 'okay, I only need 60FPS and I already refreshed the screen right now, so I'll wait 1/60 seconds'
2014-11-22 17:59:24	@Espyo	yes, I understand
2014-11-22 17:59:33	@J	ah, okay
2014-11-22 17:59:38	@Espyo	but the logic is ticking 3000 times per second
2014-11-22 17:59:43	@J	so I have 3 methods of running graphical stuff
2014-11-22 17:59:44	@Espyo	and my framerate counter checks the difference between the ticks
2014-11-22 17:59:53	@J	uh, I'll let you finish
2014-11-22 17:59:54	@Espyo	not the difference between the game screen refreshes
2014-11-22 17:59:58	@Espyo	so... it should still report over 60
2014-11-22 18:00:12	@J	how does it check the difference?
2014-11-22 18:00:20	@J	just two calls to get the current time, right?
2014-11-22 18:00:27	@Espyo	atomic time of current tick minus atomic time of previous tick
2014-11-22 18:00:30	@Espyo	wait... unless it doesn't
2014-11-22 18:00:33	@J	so unless you're specificall excluding the drawing from that
2014-11-22 18:00:37	@J	*specifically
2014-11-22 18:00:41	@J	it will include draw time
2014-11-22 18:00:41	@Espyo	let me double check
2014-11-22 18:00:53	@Espyo	it includes draw time, yes
2014-11-22 18:00:54	@Espyo	it's meant to
2014-11-22 18:00:58	@Espyo	all part of the benchmark
2014-11-22 18:01:33	@J	and draw time is slow, as we just discussed
2014-11-22 18:01:58	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-22 18:02:09	@Espyo	all right, it skips a clock tick if the event queue is full
2014-11-22 18:02:16	@Espyo	meaning if it already has a draw in queue, it skips this frame
2014-11-22 18:02:26	@Espyo	but it STILL takes into account the time difference between ticks
2014-11-22 18:02:28	@Espyo	it doesn't skip that
2014-11-22 18:02:53	@Espyo	just saying that whatever the case, the game has to tick the main logic ticker 3000 times a second
2014-11-22 18:03:08	@Espyo	and when it does, regardless of drawing or not, it checks the difference between this tick and the last, draw time included
2014-11-22 18:03:11	@Espyo	and that...
2014-11-22 18:03:16	@Espyo	generates 140~FPS on my machine
2014-11-22 18:03:20	@Espyo	 500~FPS on my friend's
2014-11-22 18:03:37	@J	okay, I'm working on removing FPS limits
2014-11-22 18:03:38	@Espyo	but being locked at 60 on yours, even though you gave it a 3000 limit?
2014-11-22 18:03:39	@Espyo	that's just crazy
2014-11-22 18:03:52	@J	no, it's the GPU stuff being smart
2014-11-22 18:03:52	@Espyo	I mean, the refresh rate, of course, that's 60, because like you said, graphics card and such
2014-11-22 18:04:05	@Espyo	but the game's clock still has to tick 3000 times a second
2014-11-22 18:04:36	@J	but you're waiting for the draw
2014-11-22 18:04:45	@J	it's really simple
2014-11-22 18:05:27	@J	while (true) { t1 = time(); tick(); draw(); t2 = time(); /* now t2 - t1 includes draw time */ }
2014-11-22 18:05:47	-->	Miles (Miles@h-47-72-682-095.hsd2.ga.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2014-11-22 18:05:50	@Espyo	OH
2014-11-22 18:05:53	@Espyo	oh, I get it now
2014-11-22 18:06:03	@Espyo	your GPU purposely stops the program from continuing
2014-11-22 18:06:05	@Espyo	or at least that thread
2014-11-22 18:06:10	@Espyo	until it decides "ok, you can draw now"
2014-11-22 18:06:21	@Espyo	I was thinking more like "oh, you asked me to draw? but I already did, so I'll just ignore you"
2014-11-22 18:06:33	@Espyo	in that case, yep, definitely 60fps
2014-11-22 18:06:52	@Espyo	well, it's still not a big brain teaser to know more or less how high you can reach
2014-11-22 18:07:12	@Espyo	if you get 20% CPU usage with 60FPS, that probably means you can reach 300FPS; in theory
2014-11-22 18:07:58	@J	ah, I managed it
2014-11-22 18:08:02	@J	okay, this is really weird
2014-11-22 18:08:06	@J	Intel graphics gives ~1500FPS
2014-11-22 18:08:14	@J	Nvidia (a much faster card) gives ~1300
2014-11-22 18:08:19	@Espyo	makes sense
2014-11-22 18:08:27	@J	not really
2014-11-22 18:08:30	@Espyo	exactly
2014-11-22 18:08:32	@Espyo	none at all
2014-11-22 18:08:33	@Espyo	wait, unless
2014-11-22 18:08:43	@J	it's probably just the type of game
2014-11-22 18:08:44	@Espyo	your... uh... there's a name for it
2014-11-22 18:08:48	@Espyo	but window management thingie
2014-11-22 18:08:55	@Espyo	it's probably already using the Nvidia card
2014-11-22 18:09:01	@Espyo	whereas the Intel one's idling
2014-11-22 18:09:07	@J	everything is really computationally simple, so the bottleneck is the latency between the CPU and GPU
2014-11-22 18:09:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-22 18:09:16	@J	no, the Intel card is the one running the desktop
2014-11-22 18:09:19	@Espyo	well, not as simple as I want it
2014-11-22 18:09:21	@Espyo	oh, is it?
2014-11-22 18:09:27	@Espyo	then I just can't make sense out of it
2014-11-22 18:09:30	@Espyo	must be the latency, yeah
2014-11-22 18:09:32	@J	anyway, Intel GPU lives on the CPU chip, so it's really near
2014-11-22 18:09:36	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-22 18:09:36	@J	Nvidea GPU is separate
2014-11-22 18:10:21	@J	anyway, it's pretty fast
2014-11-22 18:10:23	@J	*Nvidia
2014-11-22 18:10:32	@Espyo	ok, let's go back a bit
2014-11-22 18:10:33	@Espyo	you have
2014-11-22 18:10:35	@Espyo	over a thousand FPS
2014-11-22 18:10:41	@Espyo	this is
2014-11-22 18:10:43	@Espyo	unthinkable
2014-11-22 18:11:07	@Espyo	I couldn't even imagine an OpenGL application drawing a single triangle making it over 800FPS
2014-11-22 18:11:13	@Espyo	and my slow-ass engine is running at a thousand
2014-11-22 18:11:21	@Espyo	my reality is just really bent right now
2014-11-22 18:11:26	@J	CPU usage is around 85%, so GPU is the bottleneck
2014-11-22 18:11:39	@J	can I change the resolution?
2014-11-22 18:11:59	@Espyo	yeah, options still
2014-11-22 18:12:09	@Espyo	try like 32x32
2014-11-22 18:12:16	@Espyo	let's see if it reaches over 2 thousand
2014-11-22 18:12:22	@J	does it have fullscreen?
2014-11-22 18:12:31	@Espyo	no, but it shouldn't be hard to implement
2014-11-22 18:12:34	@Espyo	(it probably is)
2014-11-22 18:12:36	@Espyo	on main.cpp
2014-11-22 18:12:51	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-22 18:12:54	@Espyo	line 91
2014-11-22 18:12:59	@Espyo	before that line, add... let's see...
2014-11-22 18:13:31	@J	okay, Intel has 230FPS at full resolution (1920x1080, windowed)
2014-11-22 18:14:14	@Espyo	and Nvidia?
2014-11-22 18:14:52	@J	200
2014-11-22 18:15:01	@J	the fades actually introduce graphical bugs on Nvidia
2014-11-22 18:15:01	@Espyo	hm
2014-11-22 18:15:06	@Espyo	fades?
2014-11-22 18:15:10	@Espyo	I... never made anything fade
2014-11-22 18:15:11	@J	(fade to black at the edges of the map)
2014-11-22 18:15:14	@Espyo	ah
2014-11-22 18:15:17	@Espyo	ugh...
2014-11-22 18:15:19	@Espyo	screenshot?
2014-11-22 18:15:26	@Espyo	anyway, for fullscreen, add
2014-11-22 18:15:34	@Espyo	al_set_new_display_flags(ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN);
2014-11-22 18:15:37	@Espyo	before line 91 of main.cpp
2014-11-22 18:16:19	@J	...oh, and the captains are missing
2014-11-22 18:16:22	@J	they're just shadows
2014-11-22 18:16:27	@J	and Pikmin
2014-11-22 18:16:51	@J	the captains appear when I whistle using one
2014-11-22 18:17:01	@J	the Pikmin appear when I throw them (but not when I whistle)
2014-11-22 18:17:07	@J	the Pikmin are bad on Intel too
2014-11-22 18:17:40	@J	...wow
2014-11-22 18:17:45	@Espyo	hehe
2014-11-22 18:17:48	@J	I thought my screenshot wasn't working
2014-11-22 18:17:52	@J	I was pressing the wrong key
2014-11-22 18:17:59	@J	pause/break
2014-11-22 18:18:00	@Espyo	there's an explanation, why I think shouldn't exist
2014-11-22 18:18:02	@Espyo	heh
2014-11-22 18:18:14	@Espyo	all right, one optimization technique I made was to only update the graphics every 4 frames
2014-11-22 18:18:29	@Espyo	except these "frames" are framerate-defined-in-options-file frames
2014-11-22 18:18:33	@Espyo	not real frames
2014-11-22 18:18:34	@Espyo	so...
2014-11-22 18:18:37	@J	that's weird
2014-11-22 18:18:42	@Espyo	in a few minutes you should get the captains
2014-11-22 18:18:45	@Espyo	happened to some friends too
2014-11-22 18:18:52	@Espyo	I need to revamp that code so it's not so stupid
2014-11-22 18:18:54	@J	few minutes?
2014-11-22 18:18:55	@J	why?
2014-11-22 18:18:57	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/ss-18%3A17%3A36-1920x1080.png
2014-11-22 18:19:01	@Espyo	or seconds
2014-11-22 18:19:11	@Espyo	it's just that when I tried, it took more than "a few seconds"
2014-11-22 18:19:16	@Espyo	then again, I reach 140FPS, not 1300
2014-11-22 18:19:49	@Espyo	aaaah...
2014-11-22 18:19:54	@Espyo	I see what the problem is
2014-11-22 18:20:03	@Espyo	it's technically drawing on top of nothing
2014-11-22 18:20:07	@Espyo	the fades, I mean
2014-11-22 18:20:15	@Espyo	so... I'm guessing it contains garbage
2014-11-22 18:20:27	@Espyo	but... I told it to clear to screen
2014-11-22 18:20:38	@J	hmm, when you throw Pikmin while walking, you sometimes become unable to throw because the next Pikmin are, for some reason, the ones at the back, not those nearest you
2014-11-22 18:20:45	@Espyo	try zooming out with C, see if the whole "background" is garbage
2014-11-22 18:20:55	@Espyo	that doesn't sound ri--
2014-11-22 18:20:59	@Espyo	oh, probably the update code, again
2014-11-22 18:21:06	@J	you need to clear the screen with a colour
2014-11-22 18:21:33	@Espyo	yeah, about that...
2014-11-22 18:21:47	@Espyo	drawing.cpp:56
2014-11-22 18:21:48	@Espyo	I do
2014-11-22 18:22:15	@J	uh...
2014-11-22 18:22:16	@J	oh dear
2014-11-22 18:22:29	@J	uploading screenshot
2014-11-22 18:22:32	@Espyo	gulp
2014-11-22 18:22:57	@J	http://i.imgur.com/z3giquj.jpg
2014-11-22 18:23:13	@Espyo	t-this is zoomed out, right?
2014-11-22 18:23:15	@J	and Intel still has the scroll bug that makes it black
2014-11-22 18:23:16	@J	yeah, it is
2014-11-22 18:23:36	@Espyo	oh wait, the zoom is glitched on Intel only?
2014-11-22 18:24:02	@J	no, Intel has black, Nvidia has random data
2014-11-22 18:24:09	@Espyo	only when zooming?
2014-11-22 18:24:14	@Espyo	hmmmmmm...
2014-11-22 18:24:25	@Espyo	wait, you know the fades, does intel have them fade to black?
2014-11-22 18:24:30	@J	Nvidia has random data past borders too, at default zoom level
2014-11-22 18:24:32	@J	yeah, it does
2014-11-22 18:24:37	@Espyo	so they're related
2014-11-22 18:24:39	@Espyo	all right, good news
2014-11-22 18:24:46	@Espyo	still not sure what the HELL the problem might be, but
2014-11-22 18:24:49	@Espyo	hey, more info is good info
2014-11-22 18:25:29	@J	the RB seems really tough
2014-11-22 18:25:31	@J	lots of life
2014-11-22 18:26:10	@Espyo	the RB is very wrong
2014-11-22 18:26:15	@Espyo	it needs to be reworked
2014-11-22 18:26:27	@Espyo	can you play with the zoom at the max level?
2014-11-22 18:26:34	@Espyo	I mean, on Intel, you get all black, so you can't see anything
2014-11-22 18:26:48	@Espyo	but on Nvidia, do you get everything corrupted, or just some random tidbits like what's shown on the shot
2014-11-22 18:26:49	@Espyo	*?
2014-11-22 18:28:06	@Espyo	Game_data/Areas/Play.txt:2
2014-11-22 18:28:15	@Espyo	what happens if you change the color to like 0 255 0?
2014-11-22 18:28:17	@Espyo	on Intel
2014-11-22 18:28:24	@J	sometimes the RB keeps trying to eat where I was standing before for a while
2014-11-22 18:28:24	@Espyo	do you get a fade to green when zooming out?
2014-11-22 18:28:36	@Espyo	it's a problem with state updates
2014-11-22 18:28:39	@J	and if I run off a ledge, my shadow separates from me until I move again
2014-11-22 18:28:42	@Espyo	it doesn't update to "I need to chase other food"
2014-11-22 18:28:54	@Espyo	hm, shadows are wonky because of heights
2014-11-22 18:29:29	@J	the shadow around all the ledges make them much easier to distinguish than before, but I feel there's still some improvement to be made there, not sure how
2014-11-22 18:29:50	@Espyo	not really sure what can be done that won't be needlessly expensive
2014-11-22 18:30:00	@Espyo	hm, you can anti-alias some
2014-11-22 18:30:16	@Espyo	Options.txt:133
2014-11-22 18:30:21	@Espyo	area_quality=
2014-11-22 18:30:24	@Espyo	 1.5 or 2 should be nice
2014-11-22 18:30:26	@J	I get exactly the same corruption every time
2014-11-22 18:30:30	@Espyo	more than 4 is probably useless
2014-11-22 18:30:34	@Espyo	hm, weird
2014-11-22 18:30:35	@J	so it must be reading random process memory
2014-11-22 18:30:38	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-22 18:31:41	@J	green works on Intel, gives the same corruption on Nvidia but with the black bits green
2014-11-22 18:31:56	@J	I can also see the edges of the shadow map thing
2014-11-22 18:32:13	@Espyo	green works... what?
2014-11-22 18:32:17	@Espyo	works to make the zoom out fog to green?
2014-11-22 18:32:21	@J	yeah
2014-11-22 18:32:28	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-22 18:32:32	@J	[18:29:50] @Espyo not really sure what can be done that won't be needlessly expensive
2014-11-22 18:32:44	@J	not sure how you're doing it, but just update shadow position on height change?
2014-11-22 18:32:50	@J	it fixes itself when I start moving, anyway
2014-11-22 18:32:52	@Espyo	oh, I meant the ledge shadows
2014-11-22 18:32:57	@J	oh
2014-11-22 18:33:17	@J	yeah, I didn't necessarily mean the improvement was to the shadows
2014-11-22 18:33:28	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-22 18:33:40	@J	maybe even dim or unsaturate levels different to your current level
2014-11-22 18:33:48	@J	I don't know
2014-11-22 18:34:41	@J	aha
2014-11-22 18:34:50	@J	it's the area_quality that makes it fade on zoom
2014-11-22 18:35:00	@Espyo	hm
2014-11-22 18:35:06	@J	setting it to 2 makes the default zoom level completely faded
2014-11-22 18:35:08	@Espyo	wait, what
2014-11-22 18:35:16	@Espyo	hmmmmmm
2014-11-22 18:36:00	@J	0 segfaults; 0.1 fixes it but looks horrible
2014-11-22 18:36:19	@Espyo	right
2014-11-22 18:37:44	@J	area_quality=50 is a bad idea
2014-11-22 18:38:40	@Espyo	I bet
2014-11-22 18:38:43	@Espyo	did your RAM explode?
2014-11-22 18:39:43	@J	GPU memory, I think
2014-11-22 18:40:04	@J	yeah, it's exponential or something
2014-11-22 18:40:19	@J	5 uses 800MiB, 7 uses 1700MiB
2014-11-22 18:40:36	@Espyo	instead of rendering every sector and every ledge shadow every time
2014-11-22 18:40:42	@Espyo	I just draw them on canvases and leave them in RAM
2014-11-22 18:40:45	@Espyo	and then just draw the canvases
2014-11-22 18:40:51	@Espyo	area_quality controls their size
2014-11-22 18:40:57	@Espyo	and when they're drawn, they're scaled to fit the game
2014-11-22 18:41:06	@Espyo	meaning more size = less aliasing when applied in-game
2014-11-22 18:41:20	@Espyo	that just multiplies the width and height so... yep, exponential
2014-11-22 18:41:31	@J	oh, right
2014-11-22 18:41:36	@J	polynomial, I guess
2014-11-22 18:41:58	@J	yeah, 7^2/5^2 ~= 2 ~= 1700/800
2014-11-22 18:42:40	@Espyo	anyway, I have a lot more info to fix the bug with, now
2014-11-22 18:42:42	@J	oh, I should really get some food
2014-11-22 18:42:44	@Espyo	but I still have no idea
2014-11-22 18:42:46	@Espyo	all right
2014-11-22 18:42:51	@Espyo	I'll spend some time chewing my brain on the problem

2014-11-22 19:00:30	@Espyo	let's see if the VM interacts with my graphics card correctly
2014-11-22 19:00:37	@Espyo	all right, giving it a try now
2014-11-22 19:01:28	@J	okay, with the commented out line and area_quality=2 it's still black on default zoom (as it was before)
2014-11-22 19:01:34	@J	wait
2014-11-22 19:01:37	@J	...didn't recompile
2014-11-22 19:02:08	@J	I was right though
2014-11-22 19:02:32	@J	'zooming' doesn't change the black
2014-11-22 19:03:09	@J	without a GPU, a VM should fall back to software rendering

2014-11-22 19:03:46	Yoshi2	when I looked at that picture, I thought I was looking at a real Pikmin game because to the UI graphics
2014-11-22 19:03:58	Yoshi2	*because of the UI graphics
2014-11-22 19:04:15	@J	it does look like it could be some beta version, doesn't it?
2014-11-22 19:04:38	@J	so something just popped in my oven, BRB
2014-11-22 19:05:28	@Espyo	hehe
2014-11-22 19:05:29	Yoshi2	I thought it was a picture of the PC build of Pikmin 1 with serious graphics glitches
2014-11-22 19:05:41	@Espyo	the thumbnail could easily fool people, yeah
2014-11-22 19:06:01	Yoshi2	it helpts that the UI seems to be taken straight from one of the Pikmin games
2014-11-22 19:06:14	@Espyo	Pikmin 2, yeah
2014-11-22 19:06:21	@Espyo	except at that resolution, some numbers look werid

2014-11-22 19:25:58	@Espyo	Ubuntu 64-bit?
2014-11-22 19:26:01	@Espyo	I mean, it is suggesting
2014-11-22 19:26:05	@Espyo	that I go with 64-bit
2014-11-22 19:26:46	@J	only if you have some BIOS setting turned on and a recent enough 64-bit CPU and OS
2014-11-22 19:27:09	@Espyo	probably not
2014-11-22 19:27:39	@J	you might have an easier time with something less GPU-heavy, like Crunchbang or Manjaro
2014-11-22 19:27:41	Yoshi2	do you need to turn something on to run a 64 bit OS?
2014-11-22 19:27:53	@Espyo	I stopped trying to understand 64-bit a LONG time ago
2014-11-22 19:27:56	@Espyo	I just ask and do what people say
2014-11-22 19:28:24	Yoshi2	your CPU is very likely to support 64 bit as long as it isn't too old
2014-11-22 19:28:42	@J	Yoshi2: you usually need to enable something for it to work properly
2014-11-22 19:28:48	@J	oh, this is virtualisation
2014-11-22 19:29:07	@J	for a 64-bit VM to work
2014-11-22 19:29:11	Yoshi2	I see
2014-11-22 19:29:37	Yoshi2	I think you definitely need a 64 bit host system or else you can pretty much forget it
2014-11-22 19:30:32	@J	I don't think that's enough though
2014-11-22 19:31:02	@J	don't know why, but emulating x86-64 properly isn't as easy for whatever reason
2014-11-22 19:31:12	@J	so you need to be able to give it direct access to the CPU
2014-11-22 19:31:26	@J	for Intel, I think that technology is called VT-something
2014-11-22 19:33:57	Yoshi2	with a VM you aren't really emulating the processor if I'm not mistaken, but you are probably right with the latter part
2014-11-22 19:34:53	@J	yeah, I'm probably missing lots of details, but it's something along those lines

2014-11-23 12:11:48	Yoshi2	<Testyo> nope, but when was the last time you've seen anybody upload an improved version of a picture?
2014-11-23 12:11:49	Testyo	you probably WANTED it as a page
2014-11-23 12:11:53	Yoshi2	that is a good point
2014-11-23 12:15:49	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-23 12:15:56	@Espyo	heh
2014-11-23 12:20:25	Yoshi2	what suprises me is how there is a TCRF page for New Super Mario Bros 2 and U, the first one being for 3DS and the second one for Wii U
2014-11-23 12:20:44	Yoshi2	I wasn't even aware that it is already possible to look at the files of 3DS and Wii U games
2014-11-23 12:29:13	Yoshi2	http://tcrf.net/Talk:New_Super_Mario_Bros._U
2014-11-23 12:30:06	Yoshi2	"The method is not public, unfortunately. A few people have been allowed some access to it or the files it produces"
2014-11-23 12:31:01	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-23 12:31:14	@Espyo	well, we know about the Mario Kart 8 content's origin
2014-11-23 12:31:30	@Espyo	this really popular Mario Kart player on youtube and his friend found an exploit using the internet browser on the Wii U
2014-11-23 12:31:38	@Espyo	and they already found some content
2014-11-23 12:32:03	@Espyo	but to make sure people don't use their exploit for privacy, which would be pretty much the absolute first thing that would happen, they kept the entire procedure a secret
2014-11-23 12:32:17	@Espyo	every once in a while they upload a new MK8 video with some new shenanigan
2014-11-23 12:34:18	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-11-23 12:34:23	Yoshi2	it does sound reasonable
2014-11-23 12:36:14	Yoshi2	if you were to release an exploit this early in the life span of the Wii U, Nintendo would fix it before you even know it
2014-11-23 12:38:47	Yoshi2	starting a cycle of "You release an exploit" -> "Nintendo fixes it", causing a lot of trouble for you, for Nintendo and for other people who are not careful and brick their console

2014-11-23 12:52:38	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-23 12:55:19	Yoshi2	it is logical that this would be the first form of piracy on the 3DS
2014-11-23 12:56:32	Yoshi2	too bad this doesn't enable us to run homebrew programs on the device
2014-11-23 13:00:45	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-11-23 13:04:06	Yoshi2	I wonder if there could be a way to ask the Wii U guys for the Pikmin 3 files
2014-11-23 13:04:38	@Espyo	doubt it, they probably get LOADS of requests
2014-11-23 13:04:43	Yoshi2	yeah
2014-11-23 13:04:52	@Espyo	and they haven't really found a way to delve into the files as much as they found a way to change the memory
2014-11-23 13:05:08	@Espyo	so they find stuff like unused maps by switching the value at the address that controls the map to load
2014-11-23 13:05:12	@Espyo	not by checking the game files
2014-11-23 13:05:20	Yoshi2	somebody did extract the NSMB U files though
2014-11-23 13:07:12	Yoshi2	because the TCRF page refers to various .szs files, I assume these were from somebody who could actually dump the files
2014-11-23 13:07:26	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-23 13:07:31	@Espyo	yeah, must be something different then
2014-11-23 13:08:01	Yoshi2	to say the least, we have something to look forward to
2014-11-23 13:08:59	Yoshi2	my guess is that Pikmin 3 will at least contain images and/or text referring to the GC controller layout
2014-11-23 13:10:00	Yoshi2	but that depends on whether Nintendo put more effort into deleting unnecessary files
2014-11-23 13:13:46	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-23 13:13:49	@Espyo	they probably never change
2014-11-23 13:13:57	@Espyo	in all consoles so far, people find trivial unused content
2014-11-23 13:14:00	@Espyo	they never bother to clean up
2014-11-23 13:14:02	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-11-23 13:14:42	Yoshi2	with Pikmin 3 having been delayed once when it was supposed to be released together with the Wii U, they were likely in a bit of a rush
2014-11-23 13:15:35	Yoshi2	so there is hope for quite a bit of unused content being left in the game
2014-11-23 13:18:49	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-23 13:18:58	@Espyo	on E3 they showed some things that weren't anywhere else
2014-11-23 13:19:04	@Espyo	and it's Pikmin tradition to leave the E3 files in the game
2014-11-23 13:19:09	@Espyo	so I've got a good feeling about this

2014-11-23 13:30:38	@Espyo	it's a pretty weird doohickey
2014-11-23 13:31:23	Yoshi2	the geometry is fairly detailed
2014-11-23 13:31:49	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Burnt_out_Panther_AusfG_Battle_of_the_Bulge.jpg
2014-11-23 13:32:18	Yoshi2	the texturing might be a little bit lazy though
2014-11-23 13:33:18	Yoshi2	and it is odd that the texture on the one side says 14, while the other side says 144
2014-11-23 13:33:21	@Espyo	yeah, the texture is what's worse
2014-11-23 13:33:35	@Espyo	I thought it said 14 on both
2014-11-23 13:33:38	@Espyo	must've misread
2014-11-23 13:33:46	@Espyo	or misremembered
2014-11-23 13:33:47	@Espyo	or both
2014-11-23 13:37:03	Yoshi2	I think that is one of the few things I noticed about the model
2014-11-23 13:37:50	@Espyo	really weird then
2014-11-23 13:37:57	@Espyo	maybe it's just 14 or just 114
2014-11-23 13:38:08	@Espyo	and the texture is just mapped wrong so a 1 gets hidden or obscured
2014-11-23 13:38:15	Yoshi2	but it is nice that they bothered to add a number to the sides
2014-11-23 13:38:35	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-23 13:38:56	Yoshi2	it adds a bit of realism to it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PanzerV_Ausf.G_1_sk.jpg
2014-11-23 13:39:22	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-11-23 13:43:22	Yoshi2	somebody at Nintendo probably thought "maybe we shouldn't put war things into the game, especially not war things created in Nazi Germany"
2014-11-23 13:44:01	Yoshi2	and so sensya stopped being a tank in the final version of the game

2014-11-23 17:08:20	@Espyo	annoying ads don't deserve to exist
2014-11-23 17:09:37	Klemen702	i only keep them around so if something happens like watching a youtube video and a video with a disturbing tumbnail is at the bottom the ads block it
2014-11-23 17:10:19	Klemen702	and by block i mean ''push the thumbnail of the screen''
2014-11-23 17:10:54	Yoshi2	I'd love to have a feature in youtube where I can keep some videos from appearing in the recommendations
2014-11-23 17:11:40	Klemen702	i agree
2014-11-23 17:11:43	Klemen702	infact
2014-11-23 17:11:45	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-11-23 17:11:59	Yoshi2	those mario videos with obscene imagery are annoying
2014-11-23 17:12:41	Klemen702	about 2 weeks ago i cleaned up my computer a bit (which earsed all the other recommendations i had on youtube) and suprisingly enough, the first thing i get is random popluar channels i don't even watch

2014-11-23 17:47:05	@Espyo	you can just make a new account on your Wii U
2014-11-23 17:47:09	@Espyo	and you can restart from scratch there
2014-11-23 17:47:32	pikman789	does it keep data
2014-11-23 17:47:43	pikman789	from old account
2014-11-23 17:49:08	@Espyo	you can keep several accounts on your Wii U
2014-11-23 17:49:18	@Espyo	and what you do in Pikmin 3 in one account doesn't mean anything for the other
2014-11-23 17:49:26	@Espyo	I never tried, but I'm sure it works like that
2014-11-23 17:49:52	pikman789	i won't risk it
2014-11-23 17:50:13	pikman789	i value what i have done already to much

2014-11-23 17:51:04	@Espyo	well, it's easy to test
2014-11-23 17:51:06	Klemen702	i actually tried to make a theory once that the hocotate and koppai are the same species, using genetics
2014-11-23 17:51:09	@Espyo	create a new account
2014-11-23 17:51:12	@Espyo	try starting Pikmin 3 there
2014-11-23 17:51:27	Yoshi2	the worst that can happen is that you will see your previous save
2014-11-23 17:51:37	pikman789	i suppose so
2014-11-23 17:51:39	@Espyo	and if you don't get the save files, that means it's independent
2014-11-23 17:51:52	pikman789	okay
2014-11-23 17:52:31	Klemen702	i don't think i will continue it do
2014-11-23 17:52:32	pikman789	i will do it now i will go on again and say if it works

2014-11-23 18:04:48	pikmin789	i tried my best lol
2014-11-23 18:05:28	pikmin789	but don't both of the species eat fruit
2014-11-23 18:05:44	Klemen702	yes but
2014-11-23 18:05:53	pikmin789	well the hoctoctions like veg
2014-11-23 18:05:58	Klemen702	it doesn't change the fact that they are herbivore
2014-11-23 18:06:07	Klemen702	tomatos are fruit and vegtable
2014-11-23 18:06:15	Klemen702	if i am correct
2014-11-23 18:06:35	pikmin789	but it says louie ate some of the animals in pikmin 3
2014-11-23 18:06:45	Klemen702	well that's normal actually
2014-11-23 18:06:51	Klemen702	humans have carnivore teeth
2014-11-23 18:07:27	pikmin789	yeah but the hoctoctions are vegetarians

2014-11-23 18:08:40	pikmin789	maybe there addapted humans or something
2014-11-23 18:10:19	Klemen702	yes that is true but that does not mean someone that is born as a carnivore can't be a herbivore, it is a possibility, as stated before, some vegtables are fruits, and Brittany also ate vegtables aswell, all it was to her is the taste, which does not mean they could not be related
2014-11-23 18:10:47	Klemen702	one thing to mention, hocotate and koppai are near, so they might even breathe the same air aswell, as how louie is alive in their ship
2014-11-23 18:11:31	pikmin789	they could be separite colonies if escapex humans that adapted to there food supply

2014-11-23 18:13:36	pikmin789	but were are the humans then
2014-11-23 18:14:00	Klemen702	if you know chemistry well, then you most likely know that other planets have some of the same material as earth aswell such as gold (which can be confirmed by ''gold'' pikpik carrots)
2014-11-23 18:14:37	pikmin789	i suppose so
2014-11-23 18:14:44	Klemen702	which could explain hocotate and koppai's diet
2014-11-23 18:15:31	Klemen702	their diet is an important thing, it could make us one step further into knowing if they are the same

2014-11-23 18:20:22	Klemen702	in the female sheargrubs's piklopedia entry they eat, basicly the skin of dead pikmin, and since pikmin are in a small trait, animal that might hint them as being plants

2014-11-23 19:34:05	smuckola	  <Yoshi2> I've heard that there are some flashcards on which you can put 3DS games and it will emulate a real cartridge 1:1, allowing you to play the game <-- the only one i heard of, requires you to have a certain operating system version

2014-11-23 19:43:27	smuckola	  <Yoshi2> [22:29:37] I think you definitely need a 64 bit host system or else you can pretty much forget it <-- that depends on which virtual machine you're using.  virtualbox can't do cpu emulation, and just passes it through.
2014-11-23 19:43:36	smuckola	so you can only virtualize your native host cpu

2014-11-23 19:43:56	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-23 19:44:17	Yoshi2	smuckola: szs is a file ending for an archive format used by various Nintendo games
2014-11-23 19:44:50	Yoshi2	TCRF stands for the cutting room floor, a site dedicated to finding unused content and other interesting things in video games
2014-11-23 19:45:00	Yoshi2	http://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor
2014-11-23 19:45:07	Yoshi2	which is a wiki
2014-11-23 19:45:40	Yoshi2	and with TCRF page I mean a page for a specific video game in the wiki
2014-11-23 19:49:57	Yoshi2	what VM would allow a 64 bit guest system to run on a 32 bit host system? I'd think that emulation of the 64 bit architecture would be a bit too costly and very prone to errors to be worth the hassle
2014-11-23 19:51:28	smuckola	Yoshi2: wow how did you make pikmin fight each other?
2014-11-23 19:51:48	smuckola	i found a youtube video showing how to make pikmin become invisible
2014-11-23 19:53:32	Yoshi2	in Pikmin 3 in the Bingo mode you are playing against a second player, and you can attack the second player's Pikmin to prevent him from being able to retrieve items which he needs to win
2014-11-23 19:53:42	Yoshi2	the second player can do the same to you

2014-11-23 19:54:39	smuckola	Yoshi2: oh yes i've seen TCRF.  i remember now.
2014-11-23 19:54:46	smuckola	i really like unseen64
2014-11-23 19:55:47	smuckola	Yoshi2: prone to errors?  well they didn't program the virtual machines wrong, so no.  all virtual machines are written by supergeniuses!
2014-11-23 19:56:24	smuckola	any target cpu can be emulated on any host
2014-11-23 19:57:36	Yoshi2	yes, but virtual machines like VirtualBox and VMWare Player do not emulate the cpu
2014-11-23 19:57:47	Yoshi2	the performance would be horrible
2014-11-23 19:58:08	smuckola	yes it'd be 0%

2014-11-23 19:58:57	smuckola	hence i'm talkin about *other* virtual machines which do support cpu emulation.  such as qemu.
2014-11-23 19:59:12	smuckola	it could emulate a 64-bit guest on a 32-bit host
2014-11-23 19:59:21	smuckola	because it's a whatever on a whatever
2014-11-23 20:01:15	smuckola	crazy stuff
2014-11-23 20:01:41	smuckola	Yoshi2: i've only played bingo mode once or twice
2014-11-23 20:02:28	smuckola	just the fact that these game engines can be utilized in all these different modes PLUS CINEMATICS means that it's basically one of? the ultimate games of all time imho

2014-11-23 22:54:27	@Espyo	so I propose a policy for enemy articles:
2014-11-23 22:54:44	@Espyo	they start with an infobox and an introduction paragraph, that gives an overview on what the creature is
2014-11-23 22:55:15	@Espyo	then a section about behavior, explaining what they do when idling, when prey comes near, its attacks (in a non guide-like manner), etc.
2014-11-23 22:55:31	@Espyo	then a section for its appearance
2014-11-23 22:55:55	@Espyo	we can describe colors, proportions, skin type, similarities to real creatures, etc.
2014-11-23 22:56:04	@Espyo	then a section with the locations it can be found in
2014-11-23 22:56:22	@Espyo	then the strategy section, which normally has battle strategies, but not always (spectralids)
2014-11-23 22:56:46	@Espyo	then the usual technical info, gallery, trivia, etc.

2014-11-23 23:14:48	@Espyo	but it almost feels... empty without one
2014-11-23 23:14:55	@J	but otherwise that sounds like how most of the enemy articles already are
2014-11-23 23:15:04	@J	just moving behaviour out of the introduction
2014-11-23 23:15:08	@Espyo	for one thing, if you're reading this in a place where there are no images, at least you have the text
2014-11-23 23:15:19	@Espyo	and we can also do more than just the scale
2014-11-23 23:15:24	@Espyo	the appearance should describe how they move, too
2014-11-23 23:15:36	@Espyo	and sounds as well (bloysters moo when attacking)
2014-11-23 23:15:46	@J	that's not exactly appearance
2014-11-23 23:15:49	@J	it's behaviour
2014-11-23 23:15:58	@Espyo	I meant more like... audio appearance?
2014-11-23 23:16:05	@Espyo	there has to be a word that describes visual and audio
2014-11-23 23:16:09	@Espyo	well, forget the movement, then
2014-11-23 23:16:11	@J	just merge behaviour and appearance
2014-11-23 23:16:20	@J	and don't say much about how it looks
2014-11-23 23:16:31	@Espyo	anyway, yeah, most of the enemy articles already are pretty much like this, but we need to make it a policy
2014-11-23 23:16:37	@Espyo	so they're at least consistent
2014-11-23 23:16:37	@J	sure
2014-11-23 23:16:39	@Espyo	and one isn't severely lacking
2014-11-23 23:16:55	@Espyo	still not sure about omitting info, even if it's a bit obvious to people with images
2014-11-23 23:17:25	@Espyo	it could go in behavior, but "The Burrowing Snagret resembles a hybrid between a snake and a bird, sporting scales on its body, but a feathered head."
2014-11-23 23:17:27	@Espyo	that's not behavior
2014-11-23 23:17:33	@Espyo	and that's not really something we can omit
2014-11-23 23:17:37	@Espyo	it could go on the opening paragraph, but
2014-11-23 23:17:53	@J	yeah, that's pretty much all you need, so the opening paragraph is fine
2014-11-23 23:17:58	@Espyo	if we're briefly describing the appearance in pretty much all articles, I think it should as well have a section
2014-11-23 23:18:03	@Espyo	I'm not a fan of tiny sections either
2014-11-23 23:18:06	@J	tiny sections look-
2014-11-23 23:18:07	@J	yeah
2014-11-23 23:18:13	@Espyo	we'll give the opening paragraph method a try
2014-11-23 23:18:22	@Espyo	if we later find out more stuff that should be added, we can go with that
2014-11-23 23:18:27	@Espyo	wait, let me try that again
2014-11-23 23:18:33	@Espyo	my brain lost its train of thought
2014-11-23 23:18:42	@Espyo	if we later find out more stuff that should be added, we can try having a section for it
2014-11-23 23:19:10	@Espyo	hm, here's a thought though
2014-11-23 23:19:15	@Espyo	is this a policy...
2014-11-23 23:19:17	@Espyo	or a guideline?
2014-11-23 23:19:41	@J	well, there could always be _more_ sections
2014-11-23 23:19:54	@J	I can't think of any situations where you'd omit one
2014-11-23 23:20:03	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-23 23:20:24	@J	so it's enforced, so it's policy
2014-11-23 23:20:24	@Espyo	we have stuff as serious as the privacy policy as a policy
2014-11-23 23:20:33	@Espyo	and then we have stuff as petty as section order as policy too
2014-11-23 23:20:35	@Espyo	seems so weird to me
2014-11-23 23:20:39	@Espyo	more like manual of style
2014-11-23 23:20:53	@J	hmm
2014-11-23 23:21:08	@J	I don't think we have enough policy that it's worth splitting out
2014-11-23 23:21:17	@Espyo	no, don't think so either
2014-11-23 23:21:17	@J	it would just mean more pages that new users have to find
2014-11-23 23:21:26	@Espyo	hm, on that note

2014-11-23 23:21:35	@Espyo	should we add this enemy policy on the current "general policy" page?
2014-11-23 23:21:43	@Espyo	I'm thinking we need more policies like this one
2014-11-23 23:21:47	@Espyo	such as...
2014-11-23 23:21:53	@Espyo	area articles, game articles
2014-11-23 23:22:34	@Espyo	mission mode articles, family articles
2014-11-23 23:22:36	@J	mm, not sure
2014-11-23 23:22:42	@J	ask me again tomorrow, I need to sleep
2014-11-23 23:22:46	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-11-23 23:22:50	@Espyo	I'll try same page today
2014-11-23 23:22:57	@Espyo	if it's too cramped, I'll just create something
2014-11-23 23:23:09	@J	'kay
2014-11-23 23:23:09	@J	bye
2014-11-23 23:23:10	@Espyo	see, you should wake up at midday on weekends like me
2014-11-23 23:23:11	@Espyo	bye
2014-11-23 23:23:21	@J	that wouldn't make me have to get up any later
2014-11-23 23:23:33	@Espyo	no, but it would give more energy
2014-11-23 23:23:35	@Espyo	energy's good
2014-11-23 23:23:44	@Espyo	wait
2014-11-23 23:23:45	@Espyo	err
2014-11-23 23:23:52	@Espyo	all right, combine that, with going to bed at midnight
2014-11-23 23:23:56	@Espyo	 12 hours of sleep is amazing

2014-11-25 22:30:09	@J	and a guide contains strategies
2014-11-25 22:30:26	@Espyo	right, but this is for guides
2014-11-25 22:30:44	@Espyo	for enemies, it's pretty much just a combat strategy
2014-11-25 22:30:58	@Espyo	except like unmarked spectralids where it's just "throw Pikmin at random" or "spray the air around them"
2014-11-25 22:31:06	@Espyo	but for stuff like reaching a cave or treasure, it's pretty much a guide

2014-11-25 23:14:17	@J	the template text reads like it's missing part of the sentence
2014-11-25 23:14:32	@J	probable because you replaced strategy with guide

2014-11-25 23:16:05	@J	what does that even mean
2014-11-25 23:17:22	@J	if you haven't already done so, link to this page from the policies it 'revokes' for guides
2014-11-25 23:17:33	@J	eg. the policy that says use 'the player'

2014-11-25 23:18:42	@J	'Player-wiki relation' such an awkward title, 'Formality' or something is probably fine
2014-11-25 23:19:04	@Espyo	I can't word the template text any better

2014-11-25 23:19:12	@Espyo	I can't put it into words
2014-11-25 23:19:28	@Espyo	that canonical thing just means that naturally, stuff in guides isn't canon
2014-11-25 23:19:36	@Espyo	it's not Pikmin lore that you can use Purples to defeat the Emperor Bulblax

2014-11-25 23:19:53	@Espyo	no, Testyo
2014-11-25 23:19:54	Testyo	hah, I remember when I fixed it
2014-11-25 23:20:19	@J	the 'global effort' section says 'you can edit guides'
2014-11-25 23:20:27	@Espyo	uh, does it?
2014-11-25 23:20:30	@Espyo	I don't remember writing that
2014-11-25 23:20:45	@J	I mean, that's my synopsis
2014-11-25 23:20:56	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-25 23:20:59	@Espyo	well, it's true
2014-11-25 23:21:02	@J	well, overall I don't disagree with anything, but it's hard to digest
2014-11-25 23:21:04	@Espyo	the user-made ones you shouldn't
2014-11-25 23:21:07	@J	mostly because of the wordiness
2014-11-25 23:21:10	@Espyo	but normal guides are editable by everyone
2014-11-25 23:21:14	@Espyo	well, we need a lot of mumbo jumbo
2014-11-25 23:21:14	@J	6/10
2014-11-25 23:21:19	@Espyo	that's how we show we mean business
2014-11-25 23:21:27	@Espyo	of course you can condense it
2014-11-25 23:21:32	@Espyo	but that'll give us lawsuits
2014-11-25 23:21:44	@J	?
2014-11-25 23:22:00	@J	but yeah, saying you can edit guides is silly, because that's the default for articles
2014-11-25 23:22:19	@J	saying you shouldn't edit user guides makes sense, of course
2014-11-25 23:22:30	@Espyo	<J> 'like for instance, addressing their potential preferences or limitations' wha
2014-11-25 23:22:53	@Espyo	you know, stuff like "If you cannot throw Pikmin fast enough, it may be better to walk near the wall and attack it from behind"
2014-11-25 23:22:56	@Espyo	stuff like that
2014-11-25 23:23:01	@Espyo	potential limitation from the player's behalf

2014-11-25 23:23:10	Testyo	I haven't seen them yet, still trying to go through all those other steps
2014-11-25 23:23:10	@Espyo	<J> 'Player-wiki relation' such an awkward title, 'Formality' or something is probably fine
2014-11-25 23:23:22	@Espyo	it is awkward, but it kinda focuses on the relationship between the text and the player
2014-11-25 23:23:31	@Espyo	like how I sum it up at the end, it's like a player talking to another
2014-11-25 23:23:46	@J	meh
2014-11-25 23:23:53	@J	just reword lots of stuff
2014-11-25 23:24:18	@Espyo	that's very not-specific
2014-11-25 23:24:20	@J	what I meant about the template text is that it seems like it ends mid-sentence
2014-11-25 23:24:28	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2014-11-25 23:24:31	@Espyo	but I can't word it any better
2014-11-25 23:24:36	@Espyo	any ideas?

2014-11-26 19:58:59	@J	they just stand there and enemies don't attack them and I can't whistle them
2014-11-26 19:59:22	@J	also sometimes when I whistle a Pikmin, it doesn't move close enough for me to throw it; I have to move to the Pikmin first
2014-11-26 19:59:32	@J	Wine isn't really a solution
2014-11-26 20:04:56	@Espyo	hm, weird
2014-11-26 20:05:03	@Espyo	it's not a solution, I was just mentioning
2014-11-26 20:05:18	@Espyo	<J> also sometimes when I whistle a Pikmin, it doesn't move close enough for me to throw it; I have to move to the Pikmin first
2014-11-26 20:05:23	@Espyo	yeah, just like in the first Pikmin game
2014-11-26 20:05:24	@Espyo	fun, right?
2014-11-26 20:05:34	@Espyo	I'll probably change the throwing to be a Pikmin 2/3 hybrid
2014-11-26 20:05:42	@Espyo	it's a bit awkward switching Pikmin in Pikmin 3
2014-11-26 20:05:49	@Espyo	but if you want to throw many of the same... it's heavnly
2014-11-26 20:05:51	@Espyo	*heavenly
2014-11-26 20:07:52	Yoshi2	I didn't find switching Pikmin to be awkward in Pikmin 3
2014-11-26 20:09:10	Yoshi2	Pikmin 2 makes throwing lots of pikmin of a specific type rather annoying
2014-11-26 20:09:12	@Espyo	if the Pikmin you want is the previous type on the list
2014-11-26 20:09:17	@Espyo	and you have Pikmin of all types plus some leaders
2014-11-26 20:09:22	@Espyo	you'll have to mash L several times
2014-11-26 20:09:32	@Espyo	and because you were mashing so fast, skip over the Pikmin you wanted
2014-11-26 20:09:34	@Espyo	over and over and over
2014-11-26 20:09:57	@Espyo	but a bit more than that is how when you want to throw several of one type, and then you want to quickly throw several of a different type
2014-11-26 20:09:59	@Espyo	you just can't
2014-11-26 20:10:08	@Espyo	you have to stop throwing, switch, and then continue
2014-11-26 20:10:12	@Espyo	the game will just not let you otherwise
2014-11-26 20:10:30	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> Pikmin 2 makes throwing lots of pikmin of a specific type rather annoying
2014-11-26 20:10:35	@Espyo	it's clear that you haven't played the first Pikmin
2014-11-26 20:10:41	@Espyo	sometimes you're throwing several of the same type
2014-11-26 20:10:47	@Espyo	and a Pikmin of a different type decides it wants to be next
2014-11-26 20:11:11	@Espyo	and when you only have like 5 of the type in the front left, they aren't very organized
2014-11-26 20:11:18	@Espyo	making it very easy to start grabbing a different type then
2014-11-26 20:11:25	@Espyo	plus in Pikmin 2, they also sort themselves by maturity
2014-11-26 20:11:25	Yoshi2	I've had something like that happen in Pikmin 2
2014-11-26 20:11:29	@Espyo	it's not important, but it's neater than P1
2014-11-26 20:11:37	@Espyo	yeah, happens in P2 too, but it's rarer
2014-11-26 20:11:58	Yoshi2	I want to throw white pikmin at the poison gate, or yellow pikmin at the electrical gate
2014-11-26 20:12:14	Yoshi2	suddenly it happens that I throw some other type of pikmin
2014-11-26 20:12:19	@Espyo	yeah, sucks
2014-11-26 20:12:48	@Espyo	J: didn't you get some "widget* widget" errors?
2014-11-26 20:12:56	@Espyo	confusion between variable name and class name
2014-11-26 20:14:18	Yoshi2	to prevent pikmin from dying unnecessarily, I have to call them again which also results in the pikmin working on the gate being called back
2014-11-26 20:17:37	@Espyo	yeah....
2014-11-26 20:17:40	@Espyo	*-.
2014-11-26 20:17:59	@J	yeah, you have to watch which Pikmin are near the front, and slow down once the ones you want to throw are mostly gone
2014-11-26 20:18:17	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-26 20:18:23	@Espyo	so basically, I think the best way...
2014-11-26 20:18:26	@J	http://sprunge.us/gIbL
2014-11-26 20:18:32	@Espyo	would be the Pikmin 3 way, except letting you switch between Pikmin midway-through
2014-11-26 20:18:55	@Espyo	also a fix to a tiny problem: make the Pikmin get organized even if it doesn't matter
2014-11-26 20:19:09	@Espyo	I mean, in Pikmin 3, because the game specifically picks a Pikmin from the type you want, regardless of which is closest
2014-11-26 20:19:13	@Espyo	the group just stays like it is
2014-11-26 20:19:18	@Espyo	meaning two things...
2014-11-26 20:19:28	@Espyo	a) you grab Pikmin like 4 leader-widths away from you
2014-11-26 20:19:42	@Espyo	b) if the next Pikmin is TOO far away, you don't even do anything
2014-11-26 20:19:58	@Espyo	so if I can make it like Pikmin 3, but more responsive, and make them organize themselves anyway, I think it'd be the ideal system
2014-11-26 20:20:03	@Espyo	I should work at Nintendo
2014-11-26 20:20:32	@Espyo	wait what, again with the functions.cpp:566:73 thing?
2014-11-26 20:20:40	@Espyo	oh, another thing
2014-11-26 20:20:46	@Espyo	the makefile on github
2014-11-26 20:20:50	@Espyo	is that the one you use?
2014-11-26 20:21:06	@Espyo	because I had to edit it to make it forcefully list the files first, and only then the libraries
2014-11-26 20:21:10	@Espyo	otherwise it'd just give linker errors
2014-11-26 20:21:51	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-26 20:21:57	@Espyo	Pikmin 1 doesn't have a clear definition of a boss
2014-11-26 20:21:59	@Espyo	well, kinda
2014-11-26 20:22:18	@Espyo	but I want to say "for the sake of X, fans assume that Y are bosses because Z"
2014-11-26 20:22:20	@Espyo	define X
2014-11-26 20:30:53	@J	the makefile in there works for me
2014-11-26 20:31:22	@J	I don't know what you mean by listing files first
2014-11-26 20:31:51	@Espyo	let me refreshen my mind
2014-11-26 20:32:02	@Espyo	line 10
2014-11-26 20:32:05	@Espyo	instead of that, I needed...
2014-11-26 20:32:35	@Espyo	g++ $(CXXFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(PROG)
2014-11-26 20:32:47	@Espyo	by default, it looks like it places LDFLAGS before OBJS
2014-11-26 20:32:56	@Espyo	and that just makes it not work
2014-11-26 20:34:24	@J	right
2014-11-26 20:34:29	@J	LINK.cc is $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH)
2014-11-26 20:34:37	@J	so you switched $(OBJS) and $(LDFLAGS)
2014-11-26 20:34:48	@J	it really should work the way it is
2014-11-26 20:45:34	@Espyo	I googled some, and it told me to swap them around
2014-11-26 20:45:38	@Espyo	and that's what worked
2014-11-26 20:45:51	@Espyo	I'll add a comment to the makefile for an alternative

2014-11-26 21:00:06	@Espyo	all right, the corruption
2014-11-26 21:00:14	@Espyo	you know when you have two textures occupying the exact same space
2014-11-26 21:00:19	@Espyo	and they just flicker like crazy
2014-11-26 21:00:22	@Espyo	I mean in any 3D game
2014-11-26 21:00:27	@Espyo	is it the same thing with the engine?
2014-11-26 21:10:26	@Espyo	...with g++, if I change a file, even if it's used in loads of other places
2014-11-26 21:10:29	@Espyo	it only rebuilds that file

2014-11-26 21:39:45	@PikFan	forgot to mention that the last time was here

2014-11-26 21:40:09	@PikFan	Sunday was horrendous
2014-11-26 21:40:10	@Espyo	same here
2014-11-26 21:40:15	@Espyo	except mine has to be just a cold
2014-11-26 21:40:17	@Espyo	it's not that major
2014-11-26 21:40:48	@PikFan	at least you weren't in bed for 24 hours straight
2014-11-26 21:40:55	@PikFan	like I was Sunday
2014-11-26 21:41:22	@Espyo	ouch
2014-11-26 21:41:28	@Espyo	yeah, that's horrible
2014-11-26 21:42:02	@PikFan	anyway, I realized I had left my computer on, and saw what was going on
2014-11-26 21:42:19	@PikFan	why all this... uh, action over {{guide}}?

2014-11-26 21:42:52	@Espyo	so got timed out
2014-11-26 21:43:00	@PikFan	I see
2014-11-26 21:43:02	@Espyo	he kept calling everyone a flooder
2014-11-26 21:43:17	@PikFan	Testyo, you idiot
2014-11-26 21:43:17	Testyo	I'm trying to find English pronunciation easy
2014-11-26 21:43:24	@PikFan	.
2014-11-26 21:43:41	@Espyo	because guides
2014-11-26 21:43:51	@Espyo	they're a bit different from everything else in the wiki
2014-11-26 21:44:04	@Espyo	so a policy and template makes everything more organized and... "official2
2014-11-26 21:44:06	@Espyo	*"official"
2014-11-26 21:44:19	@Espyo	like, guides aren't normal on wikis, because they're subjective and all
2014-11-26 21:44:25	@Espyo	but at Pikipedia we want them, so...
2014-11-26 21:44:27	@Espyo	let's point that out
2014-11-26 21:44:28	@PikFan	>official2
2014-11-26 21:44:34	@PikFan	sounds like a parameter
2014-11-26 21:44:37	@Espyo	otherwise people will just think we have no idea of what a wiki is
2014-11-26 21:44:38	@Espyo	it really does
2014-11-26 21:44:51	@Espyo	have you heard?

2014-11-26 21:45:09	@PikFan	lolwut
2014-11-26 21:45:28	@Espyo	to think
2014-11-26 21:45:31	@Espyo	somebody had one job
2014-11-26 21:45:38	@Espyo	that job was purely to write descriptions
2014-11-26 21:45:40	@PikFan	well, it doesn't matter, it isn't canonical
2014-11-26 21:45:48	@Espyo	and for franchises they didn't know, they would look it up
2014-11-26 21:45:50	@Espyo	and use the info there
2014-11-26 21:45:53	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-26 21:45:54	@PikFan	still outrageous
2014-11-26 21:45:57	@Espyo	...hey, just a though
2014-11-26 21:45:59	@Espyo	*thought
2014-11-26 21:46:06	@Espyo	but wikia wouldn't happen to say "avian"... would it

2014-11-26 21:53:06	@PikFan	oh, so I finally talked to Bulbminlead or whatever his name is
2014-11-26 21:53:11	@Espyo	which in turn calls g++, but yes, make is responsible for it
2014-11-26 21:53:18	@Espyo	yeah, that is the correct behavior, precisely
2014-11-26 21:53:25	@Espyo	visual studio compiles that and a whole load of other files
2014-11-26 21:53:32	@Espyo	sure, they depend on the file I edited
2014-11-26 21:53:38	@Espyo	but clearly they don't depend enough
2014-11-26 21:53:47	@Espyo	because the changes I did on that laptop and the changes I did now at home were the same
2014-11-26 21:54:04	@Espyo	and make never recompiled more than 2 files after a change
2014-11-26 21:54:09	@Espyo	visual studio almost always recompiled 10+ files

2014-11-26 22:09:59	@PikFan	I don't know
2014-11-26 22:10:07	@PikFan	still a leaf in the mobile view
2014-11-26 22:10:11	@PikFan	on the laptop
2014-11-26 22:10:23	@Espyo	cache related
2014-11-26 22:11:11	@Espyo	mobile view is probably smoother
2014-11-26 22:11:29	@PikFan	anyway, as I was saying
2014-11-26 22:11:43	@PikFan	so I was outside with my 3DS in my pocket
2014-11-26 22:12:06	@PikFan	I was bored, and so decided to hang upside down on the playground's monkey bars
2014-11-26 22:12:27	@PikFan	...then I felt my 3DS move in a weird way
2014-11-26 22:12:34	@PikFan	so I tried powering it on
2014-11-26 22:12:48	@Espyo	aaaaand... splat
2014-11-26 22:12:57	@PikFan	the screen flashed, and it made a popping noise
2014-11-26 22:13:09	@Espyo	woah, what
2014-11-26 22:13:59	@PikFan	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFPFo-BHjw

2014-11-26 22:14:36	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-26 22:14:41	@PikFan	initially, I could get my 3DS to work by having it open at an angle
2014-11-26 22:14:52	@PikFan	and if it did the popping thing again, I'd shake it
2014-11-26 22:15:06	@PikFan	but now it pops all the time
2014-11-26 22:15:16	@PikFan	regardless of angle or shaking or not
2014-11-26 22:15:46	@PikFan	so I did some research and determined that it must have to do with some ribbons behind the upper screen
2014-11-26 22:15:56	@Espyo	yep
2014-11-26 22:18:53	Dry_Paratroopa	So what I was saying earlier with the beetle thing was that it looks extremely similar to an Iridescent Flint Beetle
2014-11-26 22:19:02	Dry_Paratroopa	It's called the Imperial Tortoise Beetle
2014-11-26 22:22:05	@Espyo	oh, nice
2014-11-26 22:22:08	@Espyo	wait, which version?
2014-11-26 22:22:13	@Espyo	classic or modern?
2014-11-26 22:22:45	Dry_Paratroopa	Modern

2014-11-26 22:57:45	UltraMario	oh god
2014-11-26 23:04:17	@Espyo	I swear there's more to this "glitched copy" than what meets the eye
2014-11-26 23:04:21	@Espyo	this is just too...
2014-11-26 23:04:22	@Espyo	wrong
2014-11-26 23:04:56	@Espyo	the area editor on the engine was giving an error
2014-11-26 23:04:59	@Espyo	memory stack overload
2014-11-26 23:05:13	@Espyo	apparently that causes windows to just meltdown and become slow until you reboot
2014-11-26 23:05:14	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-11-26 23:05:20	@Espyo	I get that it just stabbed the stack, deep
2014-11-26 23:05:23	@Espyo	but this is a computer
2014-11-26 23:05:26	@Espyo	it has no emotions
2014-11-26 23:05:29	@Espyo	it can't just mourn
2014-11-26 23:05:45	@Espyo	PikFan: tiny glitch on the engine, just fixed it
2014-11-26 23:05:51	@Espyo	but this glitch caused a function to be called over and over
2014-11-26 23:06:01	@PikFan	you never know
2014-11-26 23:06:06	@PikFan	it might have emotions
2014-11-26 23:06:08	@Espyo	basically, when you updated a scrolling bar on the area editor
2014-11-26 23:06:14	@Espyo	it would call a function to update the screen
2014-11-26 23:06:14	@PikFan	secretly plotting to undermine you
2014-11-26 23:06:18	@Espyo	this function updates the scrollbar
2014-11-26 23:06:21	@Espyo	...which updates the screen
2014-11-26 23:06:28	@Espyo	which updates the scrollbar, which...
2014-11-26 23:06:30	@Espyo	stack overflow
2014-11-26 23:06:36	@Espyo	fat chance
2014-11-26 23:06:44	@Espyo	the way windows holds up, it'd have a better chance undermining itself
2014-11-26 23:06:48	@Espyo	oh no, somebody help me
2014-11-26 23:06:52	@Espyo	I'm going to be sloweded to death
2014-11-26 23:07:03	@PikFan	sloweded
2014-11-26 23:07:08	@PikFan	word of 2014
2014-11-26 23:07:09	@Espyo	or maybe windows is going to do me in by replacing the shut down option with the change user option
2014-11-26 23:07:14	@Espyo	no joke, it did that again yesterday
2014-11-26 23:07:20	@Espyo	don't know if I told this story before, but
2014-11-26 23:07:24	@Espyo	windows 8 sucks
2014-11-26 23:07:35	@PikFan	duh, everyone knows that
2014-11-26 23:07:37	@Espyo	to shut down, you need to go to this really awkward bar on the right side of the screen
2014-11-26 23:07:42	@Espyo	I... never even used it, come to think of it
2014-11-26 23:07:44	@PikFan	its UI is /horrid/
2014-11-26 23:07:46	@Espyo	it's so pointless
2014-11-26 23:07:52	@Espyo	anyway, you have to go there and do stupid things
2014-11-26 23:07:57	@Espyo	instead, I just click the desktop and do alt+f4
2014-11-26 23:08:03	@Espyo	it opens up a dialog asking you what to do
2014-11-26 23:08:09	@Espyo	shut down, reboot, log out, change user, etc.
2014-11-26 23:08:17	@Espyo	after I do alt+f4, I press enter
2014-11-26 23:08:24	@Espyo	because the shut down option is the one there by default
2014-11-26 23:08:30	@Espyo	sometimes it's install updates and shutdown, no worries
2014-11-26 23:08:32	@Espyo	EXCEPT
2014-11-26 23:08:38	@Espyo	one out of every 200 times or whatever the hell windows thinks
2014-11-26 23:08:45	@Espyo	the default option is the change user option
2014-11-26 23:08:47	@Espyo	for literally no reason
2014-11-26 23:08:51	@Espyo	it's just random
2014-11-26 23:08:55	@Espyo	so I do alt+f4, I press enter
2014-11-26 23:09:05	@Espyo	and only after it's too late, do I realize windows changed the option
2014-11-26 23:09:14	@Espyo	the very next day, the default option is shutdown again
2014-11-26 23:09:17	@Espyo	so it really is random
2014-11-26 23:12:48	@Espyo	gonna go now
2014-11-26 23:12:52	@Espyo	this cold tired me over

2014-11-27 17:33:45	Thegoodguyalso	pikipedia wiki
2014-11-27 17:36:05	Yoshi2	if you are familiar with wikipedia, that's basically Pikipedia, just for Pikmin games
2014-11-27 17:36:27	Yoshi2	I suppose you can call it an information bucket, but wiki websites are usually better organized than a bucket
2014-11-27 17:37:34	Thegoodguyalso	That's a better word to call it, lol.  so what about this channel?
2014-11-27 17:41:03	Yoshi2	the channel allows you to talk with other users of the wiki website about things, Pikmin and non-Pikmin
2014-11-27 17:46:26	Thegoodguyalso	Okey, got it.  Thanks for the help!
2014-11-27 17:48:32	Yoshi2	You're welcome.

2014-11-27 22:44:50	@Espyo	I only have a very good theory about all this

2014-11-27 22:47:17	@Espyo	YEP
2014-11-27 22:47:19	@Espyo	proven now
2014-11-27 22:47:22	@Espyo	I've got this under the bag
2014-11-27 22:47:25	@Espyo	J, where are you?
2014-11-27 22:47:43	@Espyo	I'm way too pleased with my research, and you're not even here
2014-11-27 22:48:55	@J	I've been here the whole time
2014-11-27 22:49:04	@J	just...playing Dustforce
2014-11-27 22:49:33	@Espyo	hm, that's believable
2014-11-27 22:49:35	@Espyo	not being sarcastic
2014-11-27 22:50:33	@Espyo	all right, so
2014-11-27 22:50:43	@Espyo	like I said before, instead of drawing every sector and wall shadow every frame
2014-11-27 22:50:52	@Espyo	I just draw everything onto big images once and then draw the images
2014-11-27 22:50:59	@Espyo	these images are 800x800, a bit arbitrary
2014-11-27 22:51:21	@Espyo	now, when I noticed yesterday that disabling mipmap was the solution, I should've thought more about it, but didn't
2014-11-27 22:51:44	@Espyo	when you think about it, the images fade to nothing when the game is trying to draw the 0.5x sized images
2014-11-27 22:51:47	@Espyo	that' what mipmapping is
2014-11-27 22:51:58	@Espyo	smaller image on-screen = just use the smaller image on the mipmap
2014-11-27 22:52:14	@Espyo	now, the smaller image was all transparent, instead of being normal
2014-11-27 22:52:17	@Espyo	and I found out why
2014-11-27 22:52:35	@Espyo	the mipmap option for Allegro makes the display driver create mipmaps for created bitmaps
2014-11-27 22:52:41	@Espyo	but only for when they're created
2014-11-27 22:52:53	@Espyo	sprites don't get affected because when they're loaded, the mipmapping is created right there
2014-11-27 22:52:55	@Espyo	and it's all fine
2014-11-27 22:53:00	@Espyo	but for the case of these area buffer images
2014-11-27 22:53:05	@Espyo	they start their lives as pure black
2014-11-27 22:53:12	@Espyo	and that's when the mipmapping is created
2014-11-27 22:53:22	@Espyo	it isn't until later that I draw the sectors onto them
2014-11-27 22:53:29	@Espyo	but I don't touch the mipmaps — I don't even think I can
2014-11-27 22:53:45	@Espyo	and the rest... is history
2014-11-27 22:53:54	@Espyo	except for the fact that this doesn't happen on my machine
2014-11-27 22:53:56	@Espyo	and I figured out why
2014-11-27 22:54:03	@Espyo	I read the source code and documentation for Allegro
2014-11-27 22:54:21	@Espyo	and as it turns out, by default, on windows, Allegro uses Direct 3D, and other systems go for OpenGL
2014-11-27 22:54:23	@J	[22:47:22] @Espyo I've got this under the bag
2014-11-27 22:54:28	@J	this is not the right phrase
2014-11-27 22:54:38	@Espyo	there's no Direct3D in Linux, but there is OpenGL for windows, duh
2014-11-27 22:54:44	@Espyo	isn't it? I'm pretty sure...
2014-11-27 22:54:52	@Espyo	uh, crap
2014-11-27 22:54:54	@Espyo	*in the bag
2014-11-27 22:54:54	@J	it's not even a phrase
2014-11-27 22:55:07	@J	in the bag still doesn't really mean the right thing, but whatever
2014-11-27 22:55:09	@Espyo	isn't there an expression that goes like "I've got this under the *"?
2014-11-27 22:55:16	@Espyo	I didn't really mean I got the right thing
2014-11-27 22:55:21	@Espyo	I just meant I've got it all under control
2014-11-27 22:55:31	@Espyo	anyway, I enabled OpenGL here, and sure enough, got the exact same result
2014-11-27 22:55:35	@Espyo	here's the thing, now
2014-11-27 22:55:45	@Espyo	mipmapping only works for textures that have dimensions in powers of two
2014-11-27 22:55:47	@J	no, I wasn't saying 'the right thing' literally
2014-11-27 22:55:57	@Espyo	like I said before... my area buffer images are 800x800, so not square
2014-11-27 22:56:01	@J	anyway, let me read all that stuff
2014-11-27 22:56:17	@Espyo	the OpenGL driver on Allegro...
2014-11-27 22:56:25	@Espyo	in order to support older OpenGL versions...
2014-11-27 22:56:32	@Espyo	MAKES every texture a power of two
2014-11-27 22:56:41	@Espyo	which inadvertently makes them a candidate for mipmapping
2014-11-27 22:57:01	@Espyo	which, because I didn't realize mipmaps weren't updated... resulted in getting fade to nothingness on zoom out
2014-11-27 22:57:15	@Espyo	it was all a pretty fun experience, all things considered
2014-11-27 22:57:23	@Espyo	a bit long, though, wish I hadn't spent so much time on it
2014-11-27 22:57:33	@Espyo	there's still the garbage problem with Nvidia, but
2014-11-27 22:57:45	@Espyo	I think that's because Nvidia doesn't bother to clear allocated memory for bitmaps?
2014-11-27 22:57:52	@Espyo	so they just use whatever garbage's inside... I guess
2014-11-27 22:58:02	@J	so you don't even get mipmaps for those images on DirectX?
2014-11-27 22:58:11	@Espyo	I do, if they're powers of two
2014-11-27 22:58:16	@Espyo	which only like one image in the entire game is
2014-11-27 22:58:19	@Espyo	probably an area texture
2014-11-27 22:58:25	@Espyo	everything else is pretty 40x40 and so on
2014-11-27 22:58:36	@Espyo	and even if they are mipmaps, they're fine, because the mipmaps match up with the normal picture
2014-11-27 22:58:37	@J	yeah, by 'those images' I meant the 800x800 ones
2014-11-27 22:58:45	@Espyo	yeah, because they're not powers of two
2014-11-27 22:58:52	@Espyo	OpenGL just makes them powers of two for compatibility
2014-11-27 22:59:13	@J	yeah
2014-11-27 22:59:29	@Espyo	I'm pretty pleased with how I dug up all of this, though
2014-11-27 22:59:32	@Espyo	now, the solution...
2014-11-27 22:59:32	@J	well, that seems like it would be tricky to track down
2014-11-27 22:59:41	@Espyo	it was
2014-11-27 22:59:46	@Espyo	but after knowing... it makes so much sense
2014-11-27 22:59:53	@Espyo	and for a change, it's a satisfying answer
2014-11-27 23:00:00	@Espyo	you know those problems you spend days tracking down
2014-11-27 23:00:04	@Espyo	and in the end it's just a typo in the code
2014-11-27 23:00:10	@Espyo	this was a lot more satisfying
2014-11-27 23:00:15	@Espyo	I'm not even upset about the time wasted on this
2014-11-27 23:00:23	@Espyo	can't speak for you, though
2014-11-27 23:00:27	@Espyo	sorry you had to go through all that
2014-11-27 23:00:36	@Espyo	it was all needless if I knew that OpenGL would allow me to recreate it
2014-11-27 23:00:49	@Espyo	either way, I still don't get the Nvidia problem, so...
2014-11-27 23:01:10	@Espyo	I have two solutions now: either create a copy of the final area buffer image, so the mipmaps get reconstructed on the copy
2014-11-27 23:01:15	@Espyo	or just ditch mipmaps for those images entirely
2014-11-27 23:01:20	@Espyo	uh, I might go with the latter
2014-11-27 23:01:21	@J	well, I got 1600FPS or whatever it was, so not all was wasted time
2014-11-27 23:01:27	@Espyo	mipmapping might help performance
2014-11-27 23:01:28	@Espyo	hm, true
2014-11-27 23:01:32	@Espyo	that was pretty ridiculous
2014-11-27 23:02:02	@Espyo	can you try out an Nvidia fix hypothesis real quick?
2014-11-27 23:02:12	@J	mipmaps would help with performance _while zooming_
2014-11-27 23:02:19	@Espyo	yeah, while zooming
2014-11-27 23:02:20	@J	but not once you're at a fixed zoom level
2014-11-27 23:02:28	@Espyo	no, at a fixed zoom level too
2014-11-27 23:02:36	@Espyo	the game has to render a 400x400 image instead
2014-11-27 23:02:44	@Espyo	(well, you know, technically 512x512)
2014-11-27 23:02:49	@Espyo	less texels to work with
2014-11-27 23:02:57	@Espyo	in fact, WHILE zooming might be worse
2014-11-27 23:03:07	@Espyo	because it interpolates the 1024x1024 one with the 512x512 one
2014-11-27 23:03:08	@J	wait, it scales it every time even if it's the same as last frame?
2014-11-27 23:03:20	@Espyo	it draws what I tell it to draw
2014-11-27 23:03:29	@Espyo	and I just tell it to redraw the entire screen every frame
2014-11-27 23:03:44	@Espyo	so it knows it has to draw "area buffer image #6"
2014-11-27 23:03:57	@Espyo	and the display driver is responsible for drawing either the full-size mipmap or a smaller one
2014-11-27 23:04:00	@Espyo	I'm not in charge of that
2014-11-27 23:04:11	@Espyo	but even if everything's stopped, everything's still being drawn every frame
2014-11-27 23:04:16	@Espyo	this isn't like your slime game
2014-11-27 23:04:26	@Espyo	you look to me about crazy performance tweaks and you do that
2014-11-27 23:04:27	@Espyo	shame on you
2014-11-27 23:06:53	@J	what?
2014-11-27 23:07:03	@J	what do I do?
2014-11-27 23:07:05	@J	sliiiiime
2014-11-27 23:07:18	@Espyo	you know
2014-11-27 23:07:21	@Espyo	on that slime game you made
2014-11-27 23:07:28	@Espyo	you only redraw sections of the screen that got changed
2014-11-27 23:07:41	@Espyo	even something as minimal as the previous and current position of a slime particle
2014-11-27 23:07:44	@J	oh
2014-11-27 23:07:50	@J	same for every game
2014-11-27 23:07:55	@Espyo	I assumed, actually
2014-11-27 23:07:59	@Espyo	wait, even LD?
2014-11-27 23:08:06	@J	it's automatic
2014-11-27 23:08:11	@Espyo	...
2014-11-27 23:08:16	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2014-11-27 23:08:28	@J	I wrote some code one time
2014-11-27 23:08:30	@Espyo	how does it just know what changed until you actually draw it on-screen?
2014-11-27 23:08:30	@J	and now it happens
2014-11-27 23:08:34	@Espyo	oh, you wrote your own code
2014-11-27 23:08:42	@Espyo	I'm guessing you declare objects and such
2014-11-27 23:08:50	@J	yeah
2014-11-27 23:08:52	@Espyo	wait, sprites
2014-11-27 23:08:55	@Espyo	yeah, it's trivial then
2014-11-27 23:08:56	@J	things with state
2014-11-27 23:08:59	@Espyo	mhm
2014-11-27 23:09:05	@Espyo	still, it won't really work for stuff like the engine
2014-11-27 23:09:11	@Espyo	the camera's always moving because you're always moving
2014-11-27 23:09:18	@J	yeah
2014-11-27 23:09:19	@Espyo	the entire screen is redrawn all the time
2014-11-27 23:09:23	@Espyo	you do stand still, but come on
2014-11-27 23:09:25	@J	but rescaling is different from redrawing
2014-11-27 23:09:50	@Espyo	you do redraw the parts that used to be occupied by the image, but no longer are, because it shrunk
2014-11-27 23:09:54	@Espyo	or the other way around
2014-11-27 23:10:33	@J	either way, I guess no one really cares when you're using 3D graphics anyway
2014-11-27 23:10:43	@Espyo	they're...
2014-11-27 23:10:45	@Espyo	well
2014-11-27 23:10:48	@Espyo	they're technically 3D
2014-11-27 23:10:50	@Espyo	but not really
2014-11-27 23:10:56	@J	3D as in '3D'
2014-11-27 23:11:07	@J	as in '3D hardware acceleration'
2014-11-27 23:11:10	@J	you know, the thing
2014-11-27 23:11:11	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-27 23:12:48	@Espyo	anyway, can you help me check real quick?

2014-11-27 23:20:01	@PikFan	also, read a Pikmin fanfiction last night
2014-11-27 23:20:11	@PikFan	Pikmin 2 from the bosses' POV
2014-11-27 23:20:30	@PikFan	it actually makes you feel sad for the bosses

2014-11-27 23:30:15	@Espyo	night
2014-11-27 23:30:22	@Espyo	anyway, I was on the phone when you joined
2014-11-27 23:30:28	@Espyo	<PikFan> happy Thanksgiving
2014-11-27 23:30:34	@Espyo	we don't really do that here, but happy Thanksgiving
2014-11-27 23:30:53	@Espyo	<PikFan> it actually makes you feel sad for the bosses
2014-11-27 23:30:58	@PikFan	yeah, I know, but I figured I'd say it anyway, because why not
2014-11-27 23:30:59	@Espyo	I'm guessing most fanfics like that would
2014-11-27 23:31:47	@PikFan	the way the Pikmin were being presented actually made me think of something
2014-11-27 23:32:18	@PikFan	maybe I could write a fanfic where the Pikmin betray Olimar and Louie and declare war on Hocotate
2014-11-27 23:32:45	@Espyo	that's a bit extreme :|
2014-11-27 23:33:03	@PikFan	but it's a fanfic
2014-11-27 23:33:14	@PikFan	I may never write it

2014-11-27 23:34:05	@PikFan	if I /ever/ did write it it would be set hundreds, maybe thousands of years into the future
2014-11-27 23:34:14	@PikFan	minus the Olimar and Louie bit, of course
2014-11-27 23:34:18	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-11-27 23:34:41	@Espyo	so I fixed a haunting glitch in the engine today
2014-11-27 23:34:52	@Espyo	don't know if you know, but me and J talked about it a few times, so you might have
2014-11-27 23:34:54	@PikFan	then you could get time travel involved and then confusing things happen
2014-11-27 23:35:00	@Espyo	but on Linux, if you zoom out, the area fades to black
2014-11-27 23:35:09	@Espyo	<PikFan> then you could get time travel involved and then confusing things happen
2014-11-27 23:35:10	@Espyo	oh no
2014-11-27 23:35:10	@PikFan	what
2014-11-27 23:35:13	@PikFan	why
2014-11-27 23:35:20	@Espyo	it's a series of really complex events
2014-11-27 23:35:24	@Espyo	but basically...
2014-11-27 23:35:34	@Espyo	instead of drawing the areas one polygon at a time, each time
2014-11-27 23:35:42	@Espyo	I just draw them on an image
2014-11-27 23:35:44	@Espyo	and draw the image instead
2014-11-27 23:35:56	@Espyo	it's a sneaky and less expensive way to do it
2014-11-27 23:36:20	@Espyo	anyway, an option allows you to maximize performance by automatically creating tinier versions of the image
2014-11-27 23:36:37	@Espyo	so that when the engine has to draw the image, but smaller (like when you zoom out), it picks the smaller variant to work with instead
2014-11-27 23:36:45	@Espyo	instead of working on the gigantic 1:1 scale one
2014-11-27 23:37:03	@Espyo	the thing is, the image itself was fine, but because of the way I was creating it, the smaller variants automatically created were all black
2014-11-27 23:37:11	@Espyo	so when the engine was drawing the smaller variants (again, zoom out)...
2014-11-27 23:37:14	@Espyo	it just drew blackness
2014-11-27 23:37:35	@PikFan	strange
2014-11-27 23:37:36	@Espyo	and it happened on Linux because, normally, the images I made aren't liable to use that "smaller variants" technique
2014-11-27 23:37:56	@Espyo	but on Linux, to help with some compatibilities, the framework used there changed the images a bit...
2014-11-27 23:38:05	@Espyo	and in the process made them incidentally liable to use the technique
2014-11-27 23:38:26	@Espyo	so it's a specific operative system doing a broken task on stuff that's working fine
2014-11-27 23:38:31	@Espyo	I had fun figuring this one out, though
2014-11-27 23:42:04	@PikFan	hm, interesting
2014-11-27 23:42:20	@Espyo	it's more interesting if you're a de
2014-11-27 23:42:21	@Espyo	*dev
2014-11-27 23:42:29	@Espyo	I may end up even boring you, heh
2014-11-27 23:42:45	@Espyo	that said, the engine feels really... not solid
2014-11-27 23:42:50	@Espyo	I need to remake some parts asap
2014-11-27 23:42:52	@Espyo	...
2014-11-27 23:42:54	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-11-27 23:42:56	@Espyo	Smash 4 comes out tomorrow
2014-11-27 23:43:03	@Espyo	well, I'll work on the engine sometime in Q4 2015
2014-11-27 23:43:09	@PikFan	hmm
2014-11-27 23:43:14	@PikFan	hah
2014-11-27 23:43:40	@PikFan	dunno if I should get Smash 4
2014-11-27 23:44:01	@PikFan	personally I've always felt meh over Smash
2014-11-27 23:44:03	@Espyo	if you don't have the 3DS version, yes
2014-11-27 23:44:08	@Espyo	it's great with friends
2014-11-27 23:44:17	@Espyo	alone, it's a bit different
2014-11-27 23:44:21	@Espyo	the CPU just isn't the same
2014-11-27 23:44:27	@Espyo	specially if you play with friends and Skype
2014-11-27 23:44:30	@Espyo	or, you know, play live
2014-11-27 23:44:44	@PikFan	do you livestream?
2014-11-27 23:44:51	@Espyo	rarely
2014-11-27 23:44:56	@Espyo	and mostly only when needed
2014-11-27 23:45:05	@PikFan	mm
2014-11-27 23:45:10	@Espyo	I used to livestream a couple of games to friends, back when I had more free time
2014-11-27 23:45:15	@Espyo	also I tried recently, for something
2014-11-27 23:45:21	@Espyo	the website I was using went to absolute shit
2014-11-27 23:45:24	@Espyo	and twitch...
2014-11-27 23:45:26	@Espyo	twitch is VERY weird
2014-11-27 23:45:33	@Espyo	I can't get my account to work whatsoever
2014-11-27 23:45:41	@Espyo	even though it did work once?
2014-11-27 23:45:43	@Espyo	or something...
2014-11-27 23:45:47	@PikFan	sounds frustrating
2014-11-27 23:45:48	@Espyo	I just know livestreaming used to be trivial
2014-11-27 23:45:53	@Espyo	and now it's just... somehow hard
2014-11-27 23:47:00	@PikFan	well, I guess I'll get Smash, in case if I ever decide to play it
2014-11-27 23:47:24	@Espyo	well, don't, if your money can be spent on stuff you'd like more
2014-11-27 23:47:27	@Espyo	Smash is pretty pricey
2014-11-27 23:47:48	@PikFan	pretty sure it's only $60
2014-11-27 23:47:48	Testyo	$ 60 = 44.232 € / £ 37.83 
2014-11-27 23:47:58	@Espyo	that's pricey in my book
2014-11-27 23:48:01	@PikFan	same cost as P3
2014-11-27 23:48:57	@PikFan	and... I really don't know what to ask for this Christmas, other than clothes
2014-11-27 23:49:22	@PikFan	oh, right
2014-11-27 23:49:30	@PikFan	I was going to get a capture card
2014-11-27 23:49:45	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-27 23:49:53	@Espyo	I got the capture card because of Brawl videos
2014-11-27 23:50:01	@Espyo	but other than that, it's a bit useless
2014-11-27 23:50:06	@Espyo	I mean, it's good for capturing stuff for the wiki
2014-11-27 23:50:11	@Espyo	(when it WORKS)
2014-11-27 23:50:16	@PikFan	heh
2014-11-27 23:50:27	@Espyo	but if you're not going to be adding loads to the wiki, I don't think it's wise to buy a graphics card just for 3 or 4 screenshots
2014-11-27 23:50:35	@Espyo	and these are P1/2 screenshots, anyway, because of Miiverse
2014-11-27 23:50:51	@PikFan	screenshots? who said I'd only be doing screenshots
2014-11-27 23:50:59	@PikFan	I intend to do walkthroughs
2014-11-27 23:52:05	@PikFan	also some other random clips, too
2014-11-27 23:52:20	@PikFan	like my Pikmin growing strategies, for example
2014-11-27 23:52:34	@PikFan	I have a strategy for each of the four areas in P2
2014-11-27 23:52:42	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-27 23:52:43	@Espyo	all right
2014-11-27 23:53:19	@PikFan	I... /could/ describe them, but it's easier if I actually do it imo
2014-11-27 23:53:35	@PikFan	easier done than said
2014-11-27 23:54:21	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-27 23:57:11	@PikFan	gah, I STILL haven't done day 571
2014-11-27 23:57:33	@PikFan	I really hate whenever the ujadani show up, because my perfectionism kicks in
2014-11-27 23:57:45	@PikFan	I try really hard to maximize the spray output
2014-11-27 23:57:57	@PikFan	but I feel like I never get enough
2014-11-27 23:58:03	@Espyo	hehehehe
2014-11-27 23:58:05	@PikFan	so I get really frustrated
2014-11-27 23:58:17	@Espyo	well, one or two less won't make a huge difference
2014-11-27 23:58:25	@Espyo	after 100 days, if you get one less each ujadani visit...
2014-11-27 23:58:29	@Espyo	that just means 3 sprays less
2014-11-27 23:58:49	@PikFan	I don't even know why I'm so paranoid about it
2014-11-27 23:59:01	@PikFan	I have nearly 2,000 spicies, last I checked
2014-11-27 23:59:05	@Espyo	you'll probably give up before reaching any important value

2014-11-28 22:59:16	@PikFan	hi
2014-11-28 23:00:27	@PikFan	so last night I came up with a new order for my game
2014-11-28 23:01:31	@PikFan	in this new order, the game is divided into three main parts:
2014-11-28 23:02:05	@PikFan	the first part is about half of the game, and focuses on advancing to the enemy's base, by collecting giant Keys
2014-11-28 23:03:04	@PikFan	the second part is about finding the fragments of the final Key, which the villains had split up and scattered across the areas
2014-11-28 23:03:20	@PikFan	then the third part is the finale, and deals with the demise of the villains
2014-11-28 23:03:56	@PikFan	in the first part, no new Pikmin are discovered—all the originals from P2 are there
2014-11-28 23:04:11	@PikFan	then in the second part, five new Pikmin are discovered
2014-11-28 23:04:23	@PikFan	and in the finale, one more is discovered
2014-11-28 23:06:21	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-28 23:06:26	@Espyo	btw, PikCast is being recorded right now
2014-11-28 23:06:52	@Espyo	hmm, seems pretty epic
2014-11-28 23:06:57	@PikFan	what's this one about?
2014-11-28 23:07:11	@Espyo	Smash 4 Wii U, ORAS, and Thanksgiving
2014-11-28 23:07:25	@PikFan	ORAS?
2014-11-28 23:07:32	@Espyo	Pokémon
2014-11-28 23:08:10	@PikFan	oh
2014-11-28 23:08:16	@PikFan	oh, I see
2014-11-28 23:11:23	@PikFan	also, I made it so that Purple Pikmin aren't found right away
2014-11-28 23:11:35	@Espyo	good
2014-11-28 23:11:40	@PikFan	they're discovered mid-game
2014-11-28 23:12:05	@PikFan	I wanted to put them a little later, but whatever, at least they're not found right out of the gate
2014-11-28 23:12:59	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-28 23:13:31	@PikFan	so the order goes a bit like this: Red, Yellow, White, Blue, Purple, Cyan, Tan, Green, Burgundy, Brown, Gray
2014-11-28 23:14:42	@PikFan	current order is like Red, Purple, Burgundy, Yellow + Blue, White, Cyan, Tan, Green, Brown, Gray
2014-11-28 23:15:31	@PikFan	the nice thing is, my areas are pretty expansive, so I'll be able to divide them up in the story as needed
2014-11-28 23:15:59	@PikFan	I may need to rework Shimmering Lake a bit, but I think it'll be fine
2014-11-28 23:16:08	@PikFan	Distant Desert is set up perfectly
2014-11-28 23:16:59	@PikFan	I ran into a minor issues dealing with the resistances of Reds and Burgundys in the Great Volcano, but I came up with a solution:
2014-11-28 23:17:15	@PikFan	Reds are resistant to lava, and Burgundys are resistant to magma
2014-11-28 23:17:25	@PikFan	magma is hotter than lava, so it works
2014-11-28 23:17:43	@PikFan	[[f:Lava]]
2014-11-28 23:17:43	Testyo	"Lava" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Lava
2014-11-28 23:18:10	@PikFan	I think I'll also need to rework Great Volcano a bit
2014-11-28 23:18:22	@PikFan	then again, I may not need to
2014-11-28 23:19:03	@PikFan	...so I could just move the Burgundy Pikmin to the Burning Gulch... then the key fragment will be in the Bejeweled Chasm...
2014-11-28 23:19:09	@PikFan	that works
2014-11-28 23:20:11	@Espyo	hm, yep
2014-11-28 23:20:24	@Espyo	technically you shouldn't be able to get CLOSE to any of the two
2014-11-28 23:20:31	@Espyo	any animal being would start melting by being close
2014-11-28 23:20:46	@Espyo	regardless of resistances, an animal is still made of simple carbon cells
2014-11-28 23:20:48	@Espyo	low melting point
2014-11-28 23:20:58	@Espyo	there is a chance I just pulled this out of my ass, but
2014-11-28 23:21:02	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure I'm riht
2014-11-28 23:21:03	@Espyo	*right
2014-11-28 23:21:39	@PikFan	maybe Burgundy Pikmin have some crazy biology that lets them live in magma
2014-11-28 23:21:49	@PikFan	afaik there are Lava Dumples
2014-11-28 23:21:58	@PikFan	[[f:Lava Dumple]]
2014-11-28 23:21:58	Testyo	"Lava_Dumple" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Lava_Dumple
2014-11-28 23:22:36	@PikFan	15:20	Espyo	any animal being would start melting by being close
2014-11-28 23:22:39	@PikFan	good idea
2014-11-28 23:23:01	@PikFan	I could make it so that non Reds/Burgundys start burning near lava/magma
2014-11-28 23:23:56	@PikFan	...
2014-11-28 23:24:06	@PikFan	"I ran into a minor issues"
2014-11-28 23:24:12	@PikFan	bah, I'm horrid
2014-11-28 23:24:14	@PikFan	*issue
2014-11-28 23:25:04	@PikFan	Rugged Tundra is special, because you have to visit it at least three times
2014-11-28 23:26:39	@PikFan	I'm going to set up an obstacle between the Icy Labyrinth and the Icicle Abyss to prevent early Cyans
2014-11-28 23:27:12	@PikFan	Cyans will stay in the Icicle Abyss
2014-11-28 23:27:44	@PikFan	the key fragment will be in the Frigid Cavern
2014-11-28 23:28:29	@PikFan	ok, so for the Ancient Valley:
2014-11-28 23:29:20	@PikFan	I have no idea
2014-11-28 23:29:53	@PikFan	I remember making the subareas a long while ago, but the document with their names is saved on the other computer
2014-11-28 23:30:27	@PikFan	so basically, I'll work on everything EXCEPT the Ancient Valley
2014-11-28 23:30:43	@PikFan	I really like this new order
2014-11-28 23:30:59	@PikFan	much, much betetr
2014-11-28 23:31:01	@PikFan	*better
2014-11-28 23:31:07	@PikFan	much more balanced
2014-11-28 23:39:31	@PikFan	ooh, forgot
2014-11-28 23:39:39	@PikFan	I don't know what to do with the Garden
2014-11-28 23:40:01	@PikFan	should I have it "restored" in the first half, or the second half?
2014-11-28 23:40:48	@PikFan	wait... hmm
2014-11-28 23:41:26	@PikFan	well, since the Onions are inactive with all the lava and such, I'll be forced to shut down the volcano
2014-11-28 23:41:42	@PikFan	but the complete restoration won't begin until part II
2014-11-28 23:41:52	@PikFan	er, meant happen
2014-11-28 23:42:18	@PikFan	when the Yellow Pikmin are obtained, there will be cooled lava streams and such
2014-11-28 23:42:25	@PikFan	still pretty inhospitable
2014-11-28 23:42:36	@PikFan	nevermind, fixed my own problem

2014-11-29 12:13:39	@Espyo	hi
2014-11-29 12:25:57	Yoshi2	today will be my chance to buy SSB4 WiiU, but I'm only buying it if they have the GC adapter in stock too
2014-11-29 12:28:06	@Espyo	right
2014-11-29 12:28:11	@Espyo	hope you have better luck than me
2014-11-29 12:28:16	@Espyo	can't remember if I said it here yesterday
2014-11-29 12:28:25	@Espyo	but fnac, the store I pre-ordered from, got late in their delivery
2014-11-29 12:28:30	@Espyo	so now I have to wait an entire weekend
2014-11-29 12:30:09	Yoshi2	if they don't have the game in stock either, I'll be out of luck, but I won't be too sad about that
2014-11-29 12:30:31	Yoshi2	got plenty of homework to do while waiting for the next weekend 
2014-11-29 12:30:47	@Espyo	heh
2014-11-29 12:30:51	@Espyo	your homework really, REALLY sucks
2014-11-29 12:34:04	Yoshi2	oh yes
2014-11-29 12:34:31	Yoshi2	nobody I've talked to has said "Man, Analysis was great!"
2014-11-29 12:36:21	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-29 12:36:31	@Espyo	we all have THOSE ones
2014-11-29 12:37:39	Yoshi2	people who say that <insert unpopular subject here> is great?
2014-11-29 12:38:11	@Espyo	no, the subjects
2014-11-29 12:40:00	Yoshi2	ah
2014-11-29 12:41:20	Yoshi2	in other news, my PC is now officially back in order
2014-11-29 12:41:58	Yoshi2	the last time I was on IRC with this PC was in 16th of October
2014-11-29 12:43:09	@Espyo	nice

2014-11-29 14:38:43	@Espyo	oh, good

2014-11-29 14:42:44	@J	wait a couple of years
2014-11-29 14:42:57	@J	I used to dislike analysis, then it became my favourite subject
2014-11-29 14:44:41	@J	wait
2014-11-29 14:44:44	@J	you don't do maths
2014-11-29 14:44:54	@J	so this is probably not the same thing
2014-11-29 15:24:55	Yoshi2	J: in a couple of years I probably won't even have this particular subject anymore

2014-11-29 18:39:33	Yoshi2_	alright, no SSB this time
2014-11-29 18:40:02	@Espyo	sad
2014-11-29 18:40:13	Yoshi2_	they didn't have the adapter
2014-11-29 18:40:34	@Espyo	that's actually a bit predictable
2014-11-29 18:41:19	Yoshi2_	yes, but for different reasons
2014-11-29 18:41:24	@Espyo	oh?
2014-11-29 18:42:20	Yoshi2_	I've noticed that the store I visited doesn't have the Wii U Pro Controller either
2014-11-29 18:42:28	Testyo	I'll article you created
2014-11-29 18:42:48	Yoshi2_	it only has a bit of room for Wii U accessoirs
2014-11-29 18:43:03	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2014-11-29 18:43:07	@Espyo	crud
2014-11-29 18:44:39	Yoshi2	well, I am not sure if it would have the adapter still in stock if it had it in stock at all
2014-11-29 18:44:57	Yoshi2	I'd have to check other stores for comparison
2014-11-29 18:45:49	Yoshi2	amazon does not appear to have it in stock, that's sure
2014-11-29 18:46:23	@Espyo	it really is understocked everywhere
2014-11-29 18:46:27	@Espyo	I was lucky to have it on my store
2014-11-29 18:46:34	@Espyo	...the one that delayed the shipment to monday
2014-11-29 18:48:41	Yoshi2	the situation might improve in the next week, and I only have time to play non-PC stuff on weekends

2014-11-29 19:11:01	@Espyo	what's the error message?
2014-11-29 19:11:01	UltraMario	it also doesn't let me create redirects
2014-11-29 19:11:09	UltraMario	it might have something to do with me being a new user
2014-11-29 19:11:15	UltraMario	wait lemme try it and i'll tell you
2014-11-29 19:11:33	@Espyo	ah, it might

2014-11-29 19:11:42	UltraMario	:(
2014-11-29 19:11:45	@Espyo	there are probably guidelines somewhere about what to do to get permissions
2014-11-29 19:11:54	UltraMario	idk where any guidelines are
2014-11-29 19:12:04	@Espyo	I'll try finding them
2014-11-29 19:12:07	UltraMario	and the help pages in the sidebar just bring me to mediawiki
2014-11-29 19:12:11	UltraMario	alright thanks

2014-11-29 19:13:45	@Espyo	they say all you need to upload an image is an account
2014-11-29 19:13:48	@Espyo	you sure you're logged in?
2014-11-29 19:14:03	UltraMario	yeah...

2014-11-29 19:14:18	UltraMario	that's my account
2014-11-29 19:14:27	UltraMario	hm...
2014-11-29 19:15:16	@Espyo	looks like you need to be autoconfirmed
2014-11-29 19:15:23	@Espyo	http://wikibound.info/wiki/Special:ListGroupRights
2014-11-29 19:15:30	@Espyo	the autoconfirmed section says those users can create pages
2014-11-29 19:15:35	@Espyo	how do you GET autoconfirm?
2014-11-29 19:15:40	@Espyo	...might depend on the wiki
2014-11-29 19:15:45	@Espyo	I'm not sure what Pikipedia's requirements are
2014-11-29 19:15:49	UltraMario	idk
2014-11-29 19:15:52	@Espyo	but I think the usual is just "make 10 edits"
2014-11-29 19:15:53	@Espyo	or something like that
2014-11-29 19:16:01	UltraMario	i know how to get autoconfirmed in mariowiki
2014-11-29 19:16:14	UltraMario	does uploading a new version of an image count as an edit?
2014-11-29 19:16:22	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-29 19:16:25	@Espyo	I'm not too sure
2014-11-29 19:16:29	UltraMario	crap
2014-11-29 19:16:39	UltraMario	might have to contact tacopill on this one
2014-11-29 19:16:46	UltraMario	he's an admin there
2014-11-29 19:17:11	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-11-29 19:17:13	UltraMario	although i'm not a member on the other wikis he's on so i don't really have a way of contacting him
2014-11-29 19:17:16	@Espyo	well, the system is in place for a reason
2014-11-29 19:17:24	UltraMario	yeah i know
2014-11-29 19:17:26	@Espyo	you can probably edit his talk page anyway
2014-11-29 19:17:28	@Espyo	you can't CREATE a talk page
2014-11-29 19:17:30	@Espyo	but you can edit
2014-11-29 19:17:56	Yoshi2	on the tcrf wiki, my first contribution is uploading an image
2014-11-29 19:17:56	UltraMario	i'm not sure if he's active there tho :(
2014-11-29 19:18:19	Yoshi2	that puts the different requirements from each wiki into perspective
2014-11-29 19:18:29	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-29 19:18:45	@Espyo	well, even if he's not active
2014-11-29 19:18:54	@Espyo	he'll probably still receive an e-mail about how his talk page was changed
2014-11-29 19:18:57	@Espyo	and get on it
2014-11-29 19:19:02	UltraMario	alright well
2014-11-29 19:19:08	UltraMario	i guess i should ask him
2014-11-29 19:19:13	UltraMario	what should i ask him tho?
2014-11-29 19:19:14	UltraMario	:P
2014-11-29 19:19:27	UltraMario	what are the requirements to become an autoconfirmed user on this wiki?
2014-11-29 19:19:31	UltraMario	or something
2014-11-29 19:19:48	UltraMario	does that sound good?
2014-11-29 19:20:40	@Espyo	yeah
2014-11-29 19:20:48	@Espyo	or ask what the requirements are to be able to upload pics
2014-11-29 19:20:54	@Espyo	tell him what you want to upload to
2014-11-29 19:21:04	@Espyo	because loads of people just join in on wikis and start uploading unrelated crap
2014-11-29 19:21:08	@Espyo	and that's why these systems exist
2014-11-29 19:21:09	UltraMario	well i wanted to upload a pic of dr. andonuts in mother 3
2014-11-29 19:21:16	UltraMario	cuz it needed more pics of him
2014-11-29 19:21:27	@Espyo	so if you tell him what's up, he might just skip the system and let you upload right away
2014-11-29 19:21:29	UltraMario	and it didn't have a sprite of him from mother 3
2014-11-29 19:21:33	@Espyo	right
2014-11-29 19:21:37	UltraMario	alright, thanks
2014-11-29 19:23:06	UltraMario	alright i messaged him
2014-11-29 19:23:26	@Espyo	okay
2014-11-29 19:23:55	UltraMario	i hope he responds tho. the last time he got a message was last year
2014-11-29 19:23:55	UltraMario	D:
2014-11-29 19:25:24	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-29 19:26:15	UltraMario	he's also a member on nintendo wiki, f-zero wiki, and Fire Emblem Wiki, and Lylat Wiki
2014-11-29 19:26:29	UltraMario	are you a member on any of those?
2014-11-29 19:27:48	@J	who are we looking for?
2014-11-29 19:27:55	UltraMario	Tacopill
2014-11-29 19:27:56	@Espyo	uh, not really
2014-11-29 19:28:01	@J	oh
2014-11-29 19:28:02	@Espyo	EarthBound's would be the more active one
2014-11-29 19:28:06	@J	hmm, haven't heard from him in a while
2014-11-29 19:28:08	@Espyo	and even then, like I said, I'm not sure I have an account
2014-11-29 19:28:14	UltraMario	it's alright
2014-11-29 19:28:23	UltraMario	it's just i need whatever help i can get
2014-11-29 19:28:31	UltraMario	cuz the wiki could still use some work
2014-11-29 19:29:14	@J	what did you want him for?
2014-11-29 19:29:21	@J	he's on Skype, but currently status is away

2014-11-29 19:30:15	UltraMario	i don't have the permission to upload images tho for some reason
2014-11-29 19:30:18	@J	hmm, okay
2014-11-29 19:30:24	@J	you can usually check special:listgrouprights
2014-11-29 19:30:25	@J	to see why
2014-11-29 19:30:47	@J	Espyo: randomly saw you asking about scaling images on Skype
2014-11-29 19:30:48	UltraMario	well you need to be autoconfirmed
2014-11-29 19:30:55	@J	there's this thing called scale2x
2014-11-29 19:30:58	UltraMario	but idk how many edits you need to do that on this wiki
2014-11-29 19:31:00	@J	also scale3x, I think
2014-11-29 19:31:04	@J	and it can look pretty good
2014-11-29 19:31:12	UltraMario	and idk if uploading better versions of images counts as edits or not
2014-11-29 19:31:24	@J	hmm, okay
2014-11-29 19:31:42	@Espyo	it's skype, just ignore it
2014-11-29 19:31:47	@Espyo	I don't remember even telling you anything
2014-11-29 19:31:55	@J	it's usually something like your account has to be 7 days old and you need 10 edits
2014-11-29 19:32:02	UltraMario	alright
2014-11-29 19:32:02	@J	Espyo: no, in the Pikmin Wiki chat
2014-11-29 19:32:06	@Espyo	oh
2014-11-29 19:32:08	@Espyo	uh...
2014-11-29 19:32:11	@Espyo	that was probably months ago
2014-11-29 19:32:16	@Espyo	so far ago in fact that I can't remember
2014-11-29 19:32:17	@J	it was Wednesday
2014-11-29 19:32:25	@Espyo	oh, right!
2014-11-29 19:32:26	@Espyo	that thing
2014-11-29 19:32:29	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-11-29 19:32:35	@J	uh...but not last Wednesday
2014-11-29 19:32:37	@Espyo	not quite sure if that's what I was thinking though
2014-11-29 19:32:38	UltraMario	j do you think reuploading images counts as an edit or not
2014-11-29 19:32:42	@Espyo	I'm not even sure what I was thinking, or am thinking
2014-11-29 19:32:46	UltraMario	cuz then i'd have over 10 edits
2014-11-29 19:32:49	@Espyo	that said, I do know about some of those
2014-11-29 19:32:51	@Espyo	they're used in emulators too

2014-11-29 20:02:48	@Espyo	so meh, don't worry about it
2014-11-29 20:02:49	UltraMario	alright thanks
2014-11-29 20:02:54	@Espyo	hm, are you sure they WANT the shadow, though?
2014-11-29 20:02:59	@Espyo	they might prefer a shadowless version
2014-11-29 20:03:00	UltraMario	it has a refresh key but it didn't change
2014-11-29 20:03:01	UltraMario	yes
2014-11-29 20:03:04	@Espyo	because the shadow doesn't really add anything
2014-11-29 20:03:06	@Espyo	all right, then
2014-11-29 20:03:07	UltraMario	all the other sprites have the shadows

2014-11-29 22:56:43	@J	if it's a Windows command-line application, won't doing the loop in a batch file mean you only get one console window?
2014-11-29 22:57:23	@J	also, I expected the Wiimms stuff has a rarc extracter
2014-11-29 22:58:11	Yoshi2	hm, yes, wiimms stuff likely has something better than the tool I am using right now
2014-11-29 22:59:37	Yoshi2	I wrote the script in python, and I am not sure how to suppress the popping up console windows
2014-11-29 22:59:47	Yoshi2	there might be a way to do that
2014-11-29 23:00:27	@J	it's because it's running the process each time when a console window doesn't exist
2014-11-29 23:00:32	@J	Windows console applications are weird
2014-11-29 23:00:37	@J	the way to avoid it is to write a batch script
2014-11-29 23:00:47	@J	(or use a shell like Bash or Zsh)

2014-11-29 23:01:29	Yoshi2	I suppose so

2014-11-29 23:02:58	@Espyo	<J> if it's a Windows command-line application, won't doing the loop in a batch file mean you only get one console window?

2014-11-29 23:09:08	Yoshi2	let's see if this model replacement works
2014-11-29 23:10:09	Yoshi2	bmd models can only be replaced with other bmd models correctly, so that limits me to a number of objects in the game

2014-11-29 23:41:50	Yoshi2	it appears quite a lot biger than it should be because the real object at this spot was scaled up quite a bit
2014-11-29 23:42:10	@Espyo	hah!
2014-11-29 23:42:50	Yoshi2	and the texture is red, that is an issue I encountered once when I was replacing models from the same game
2014-11-29 23:43:49	@Espyo	hmm
2014-11-29 23:45:53	Yoshi2	as a bonus, if the gun is the front, you can see 144 on its left side
2014-11-29 23:46:54	Yoshi2	which means that they actually textured it like this
2014-11-29 23:48:30	@Espyo	yep

2014-11-30 23:26:15	@PikFan	I plan on adding some caves for the postgame storyline
2014-11-30 23:27:09	@Espyo	hm
2014-11-30 23:28:53	@PikFan	you have to use Ultima Pikmin to get to them
2014-11-30 23:29:29	@PikFan	I think I'll name them "Trial of ____"
2014-11-30 23:29:39	@PikFan	depending on the area
2014-11-30 23:30:54	@PikFan	I still don't know what the postgame story will be
2014-11-30 23:31:52	@PikFan	now ideas are swarming my head
2014-11-30 23:32:22	@PikFan	it will definitely be more laid-back
2014-11-30 23:33:21	@PikFan	maybe like... collecting treasure to build city-domes on PNF-404
2014-11-30 23:34:32	@Espyo	funky
2014-11-30 23:35:27	@PikFan	thing is, if you complete the postgame story, then you can do something special
2014-11-30 23:35:57	@PikFan	you take an SD card, copy down the game's data onto it
2014-11-30 23:36:13	@PikFan	then boot up Pikmin: Impact
2014-11-30 23:36:49	@PikFan	it will notice you have PCW game save data, and will ask to read it
2014-11-30 23:37:26	@PikFan	it will see that you completed the poststory, and so unlock somethin special
2014-11-30 23:37:36	@PikFan	*something
2014-11-30 23:38:24	@PikFan	dunno what that "special something" quite is yet

2014-12-01 23:30:24	@PikFan	anyway, so before, you would just march through the Landing Site and Sparkling Oasis, and go straight through to the Deceiving Desert
2014-12-01 23:30:28	@PikFan	not anymore
2014-12-01 23:30:37	@PikFan	I've put in a new puzzle
2014-12-01 23:30:55	@PikFan	it's pretty simple
2014-12-01 23:31:18	@PikFan	there's a Reinforced Wall blocking off access to the Sparkling Oasis
2014-12-01 23:31:28	@PikFan	so you have to find some bomb rocks
2014-12-01 23:31:51	@PikFan	they're in a Medusal Slurker across two sinkholes
2014-12-01 23:32:16	@PikFan	so you have to build a bridge made of 30 fragments to get over the sinkholes
2014-12-01 23:32:28	@PikFan	15 fragments are out in the open
2014-12-01 23:32:45	@PikFan	the other 15 are in a dirt mound behind an electric gate
2014-12-01 23:33:49	@PikFan	anyway, I was going to scan it and show you guys, but my computer decided to flop on me, so now I can't

2014-12-02 19:31:33	Yoshi2	it is, but I have some siblings who also would like to play the game
2014-12-02 19:31:42	Mariostar	ah.
2014-12-02 19:31:42	Yoshi2	so having more than one controller is very useful

2014-12-02 19:33:12	Yoshi2	and the adapter bundle is 10€ cheaper, as far as I can tell
2014-12-02 19:33:13	Testyo	10 € = £ 8.552  / $ 13.564 
2014-12-02 19:33:52	Mariostar	K.
2014-12-02 19:34:09	Mariostar	U RETARD
2014-12-02 19:34:14	Yoshi2	at least if you don't buy it from some reseller who wants to make 50% profit by selling the product for 90-100€ instead of the usual 65€ price
2014-12-02 19:34:15	Testyo	-100 € = £ -85.52  / $ -135.64 
2014-12-02 19:34:16	Mariostar	Y U NOOO BY GIME
2014-12-02 19:34:31	Mariostar	Amazon is really cheap.
2014-12-02 19:34:59	Yoshi2	amazon is also out of adapters/SSB+adapter bundles right now
2014-12-02 19:35:13	Mariostar	Ok.
2014-12-02 19:35:24	Mariostar	You should have pre-orderd it.
2014-12-02 19:35:55	Yoshi2	probably
2014-12-02 19:36:53	Yoshi2	but I'm not exactly in a hurry to buy it, only have time to play it on weekends due to university stuff
2014-12-02 19:37:44	Mariostar	Ok.

2014-12-02 22:24:20	@Espyo	I think he got an insane time on the Plasm Wraith, something like 2 minutes, probably
2014-12-02 22:24:34	@Espyo	I was actually talking about the normal collect treasure and battle enemies stages
2014-12-02 22:24:37	Shard1	No idea how people do that.

2014-12-03 20:10:31	@J	Yoshi2: replace the Pikmin model with the tank model
2014-12-03 20:10:58	Yoshi2	J: that would be hilarious
2014-12-03 20:11:29	Yoshi2	but Pikmin have animations, it would either crash or be VERY glitchy

2014-12-03 20:49:34	Yoshi2_	maybe orima2 was the president, who then was renamed to syatyou which means "President"
2014-12-03 20:49:58	Yoshi2_	which could mean that Louie was thought up at a later point than the president

2014-12-03 20:51:50	Yoshi2_	the president might have been yet another employee who would be going around the planet with Olimar

2014-12-03 21:00:54	Yoshi2	hm, I've got a more hilarious idea than replacing the pikmin with tank turrets
2014-12-03 21:01:06	Yoshi2	I can actually replace the plant on their head with a different model
2014-12-03 21:08:11	@Espyo	yeah, it's not hard to imagine purples were originally black
2014-12-03 21:08:15	@Espyo	three primary colors + black and white
2014-12-03 21:11:02	Yoshi2	black pikmin probably didn't look good in the rather bright environments

2014-12-03 21:24:25	@Espyo	aww
2014-12-03 21:25:52	Yoshi2	now it crashes my game on startup, woohoo
2014-12-03 21:32:11	Yoshi2	I was about to ask if Pikmin 2 has a pikmin-like creature that looks like a bulborb, and then I stumble upon this: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Bulbmin

2014-12-03 21:47:13	Yoshi2	I'm quite suprised by how tolerant the engine is
2014-12-03 21:48:02	Shard1	Could you fill me in?
2014-12-03 21:48:50	Yoshi2	Shard1: I am experimenting with replacing model files in Pikmin 2
2014-12-03 21:49:21	Shard1	You're using Dolphin, right?
2014-12-03 21:49:59	Yoshi2	in this case I replaced the plants on top of the pikmin with that tank turret which is an unused model in Pikmin 2
2014-12-03 21:50:02	Yoshi2	yep
2014-12-03 21:50:42	Yoshi2	testing this on a real console would be very painful, to say the least
2014-12-03 21:52:15	Shard1	Well, I remember that I went on vacation, and that I downloaded Dolphin and Pikmin 2 (Took forever) but I didn't have enough time to actually play through it

2014-12-03 21:54:51	Shard1	And why did I download dolphin? Because I wasn't around for Pikmin and Pikmin 2. Although Pikmin 3 was awesome

2014-12-03 21:55:53	@Espyo	hah
2014-12-03 21:56:31	Shard1	Hopefully we'll get Pikmin 4 in 2016

2014-12-04 21:38:07	Shard1	Hello
2014-12-04 21:38:10	Shard1	Yes, there is

2014-12-04 21:38:21	Yoshi2	an official one?
2014-12-04 21:38:30	Shard1	Look it up, it was from Club Nintendo in Japan
2014-12-04 21:39:54	Yoshi2	ah, that makes sense
2014-12-04 21:40:43	Shard1	I wish I had it
2014-12-04 21:42:34	Yoshi2	I have lots of star points for club nintendo which I haven't even redeemed yet because you lose a part of the unused points every year or so
2014-12-04 21:42:56	Yoshi2	the point cards also have a date written on them past which the points cannot be redeemed anymore
2014-12-04 21:43:05	Yoshi2	so my stacks of points are slowly becoming useless
2014-12-04 21:43:45	Shard1	I have about 690 coins 
2014-12-04 21:44:14	Shard1	But we all know that Club Nintendo of AMERICA is doing a very FINE job with their physical rewards

2014-12-04 21:47:34	@Espyo	hehe
2014-12-04 21:52:05	Yoshi2	... you weren't joking
2014-12-04 21:52:08	Yoshi2	http://stars.nintendo-europe.com/products/8-bit-mario-festive-gift-wrapping-paper-274
2014-12-04 21:52:13	Yoshi2	what the hell, nintendo
2014-12-04 21:53:21	Yoshi2	well, there is a Yoshi backpack
2014-12-04 21:53:46	Yoshi2	and a Yoshi plushie
2014-12-04 21:54:18	Shard1	look at America https://club.nintendo.com/rewards.do 
2014-12-04 21:56:25	Yoshi2	a big lack of physical items
2014-12-04 21:57:01	Shard1	exactly
2014-12-04 21:57:08	Shard1	And I want those Pikmin ringtones
2014-12-04 22:00:11	Yoshi2	some of these physical items are so expensive, you're better off just buying them off somebody on the internet
2014-12-04 22:01:31	Yoshi2	because of the decaying star points, you'll never get enough points to buy the 4000 points items
2014-12-04 22:03:00	Shard1	I want those ringtones though
2014-12-04 22:03:14	Shard1	How in the world am I going to get a Pikmin 3 ringtone?
2014-12-04 22:05:07	Shard1	I got it!
2014-12-04 22:05:12	Shard1	Here's what I'll do
2014-12-04 22:05:31	Shard1	When I go to Poland this year for vacation, I'll get my cousin to buy a Wii U.
2014-12-04 22:05:38	Shard1	I'll register it and then BAM!
2014-12-04 22:07:21	Yoshi2	that sounds like an expensive way to get the ringtones
2014-12-04 22:07:30	Yoshi2	unless your cousin wanted a Wii U anyway
2014-12-04 22:07:57	Shard1	Even though he has an Xbox, he thinks that the Wii U is pretty cool
2014-12-04 22:08:11	Shard1	It took awhile, showing him all the cool games and everything
2014-12-04 22:08:26	Yoshi2	would probably be less expensive if you found somebody who could just buy the ringtones for 50 points and send you the files
2014-12-04 22:08:40	Yoshi2	somebody who has a lot of points just lying around *cough* *cough*
2014-12-04 22:08:54	Shard1	I have an old-fashioned phone, would they work on that?
2014-12-04 22:09:13	Yoshi2	depends on how old-fashioned it is
2014-12-04 22:09:23	Shard1	It's a flip-phone
2014-12-04 22:10:01	Yoshi2	if the phone is capable of setting up a music file as the ring tone, you should be fine
2014-12-04 22:10:44	Shard1	I got to check
2014-12-04 22:11:01	Yoshi2	it will also be very helpful if you have a way to transfer files to it
2014-12-04 22:11:34	Yoshi2	over some sort of USB cable, a micro sd card or bluetooth using a friend's phone
2014-12-04 22:18:41	Shard1	Well, my phone is a samsung sgh-t319 Does that help?
2014-12-04 22:19:57	Shard1	Hmm, it says it can get custom MP3 files
2014-12-04 22:21:06	Yoshi2	http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Samsung-SGH-T319_id1539 looks like it does have an USB port for connecting it to the PC, so you should be able to transfer files
2014-12-04 22:21:40	Yoshi2	it'll be up to you to test what kind of file formats will work on the phone
2014-12-04 22:22:12	Yoshi2	the nintendo website mentions that the ringtones are in the .wav format, so you might want to check for that
2014-12-04 22:23:33	Shard1	I'm either dumb, or just very ignorant, where in the world is the USB port?
2014-12-04 22:26:26	Yoshi2	check for anything resembling something you could stick a cable into
2014-12-04 22:26:54	Shard1	Never mind, it was in the box
2014-12-04 22:27:35	@J	Espyo: what's up with your commits yesterday?
2014-12-04 22:27:39	@J	one per each file deletion

2014-12-04 22:42:54	Shard1	Ughh....
2014-12-04 22:44:32	Shard1	This math homework is rigged or something
2014-12-04 22:44:47	Shard1	Almost all the answers are the same

2014-12-04 23:07:52	Shard1	I can't wait to get on with Pikmin 3
2014-12-04 23:09:22	Yoshi2	the amount of maths I have to do now would make the head of anybody who goes to high school spin
2014-12-04 23:09:41	Shard1	That bad?
2014-12-04 23:10:44	Shard1	Hmm, I think I'll take Wistful Wild to warm up tomarrow in band
2014-12-04 23:10:45	Yoshi2	it it is quite a bit of work
2014-12-04 23:11:09	Yoshi2	it doesn't help that we are currently learning new things every week
2014-12-04 23:11:27	Shard1	That just makes things worse
2014-12-04 23:12:42	Yoshi2	well, "new" things
2014-12-04 23:12:56	Shard1	Probably just review from last year
2014-12-04 23:13:05	Shard1	That's how it always is
2014-12-04 23:14:15	Yoshi2	the way it is here, we are doing all the topics that are usually done in school, plus new things that are not usually done in school
2014-12-04 23:14:29	Shard1	really?
2014-12-04 23:14:39	Shard1	I really don't excel at much
2014-12-04 23:14:49	Shard1	(Especially drawing)
2014-12-04 23:14:56	Yoshi2	so everybody will be roughly up to speed on what they need to know about maths
2014-12-04 23:15:05	Yoshi2	ehm, *all the things in maths
2014-12-04 23:15:45	Shard1	I'm good at math(doesn't mean I like it) Literature and Language, Band, and Gym.
2014-12-04 23:17:03	Yoshi2	as I'm out of school already, I do not have to deal with art or music or other things which are not relevant to the subject I'm studying
2014-12-04 23:17:28	Shard1	I'm a musician.
2014-12-04 23:17:58	Shard1	And a self-proclaimed nerd
2014-12-04 23:18:45	Yoshi2	I used to think that I was the computer nerd in my class in school, but some of the people I've met here, damn
2014-12-04 23:19:03	Shard1	That was the same for me.
2014-12-04 23:19:22	Yoshi2	they actually know things about computers, quite a bit more than myself too
2014-12-04 23:19:32	Shard1	Same here. 
2014-12-04 23:20:18	Yoshi2	not that it discourages me, that is actually pretty cool
2014-12-04 23:20:28	Shard1	Same here.
2014-12-04 23:23:28	Shard1	For example, Shift-Ctrl-Alt on chromebook to make the screen spin
2014-12-04 23:24:06	Yoshi2	that is not quite what I meant by "know things about computers"
2014-12-04 23:24:18	UltraMario	i tried it
2014-12-04 23:24:24	UltraMario	doesn't work
2014-12-04 23:24:47	Shard1	what, it works for me
2014-12-04 23:25:00	UltraMario	huh...
2014-12-04 23:25:00	Shard1	Oops, you also have to press refresh
2014-12-04 23:25:11	UltraMario	for what?
2014-12-04 23:25:31	Shard1	Shift-Ctrl-Alt plus refresh on chromebook
2014-12-04 23:26:01	UltraMario	WOW
2014-12-04 23:26:05	UltraMario	do a barrel roll
2014-12-04 23:26:05	UltraMario	lol
2014-12-04 23:26:33	Shard1	also, shift-ctrl plus refresh
2014-12-04 23:27:26	Shard1	do that for a "new" perspective
2014-12-04 23:27:31	Yoshi2	I'll take a nap now, good night

2014-12-05 21:09:40	@J	Testyo is already a carrot
2014-12-05 21:09:41	Testyo	but yeah, here, the larger one means the one with links that way
2014-12-05 21:17:02	Yoshi2	Testyo: are you a carrot? (y/n)

2014-12-05 21:18:13	Shard1	hello
2014-12-05 21:20:16	Yoshi2	hey
2014-12-05 21:21:29	Shard1	how goes the model swaps?
2014-12-05 21:25:48	Yoshi2	haven't done anything new since last time
2014-12-05 21:26:30	Shard1	Well, then how was your day?
2014-12-05 21:26:37	Yoshi2	model swapping is fun for the first few times, but it becomes rather boring unless you have a specific goal in mind
2014-12-05 21:27:21	Shard1	yeah, I guess so.
2014-12-05 21:27:57	@Espyo	hi
2014-12-05 21:28:03	Shard1	Hello
2014-12-05 21:28:03	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-12-05 21:28:14	@Espyo	but there has to be more you can do
2014-12-05 21:28:15	Shard1	I'm going to finish Pikmin 3 100% for the third time today
2014-12-05 21:28:21	@Espyo	nice
2014-12-05 21:28:24	@Espyo	speedruns?
2014-12-05 21:29:16	Shard1	Not quite
2014-12-05 21:29:22	Shard1	I might try someday
2014-12-05 21:29:39	Shard1	So far I'm just trying to get codes for the secret logs
2014-12-05 21:40:14	Yoshi2	Espyo: I can't imagine a lot of interesting things that can be done simply by doing model swaps that are still interesting
2014-12-05 21:40:41	Yoshi2	I suppose you could try to put unused models back into the game
2014-12-05 21:41:32	Yoshi2	I do find the config files for the maps quite interesting, I might either try to find an existing parser for them, or write a new one
2014-12-05 21:41:58	Shard1	I don't really know a lot about model swaps, etc.
2014-12-05 21:42:37	Yoshi2	Shard1: there isn't that much to say about model swapping
2014-12-05 21:42:50	Shard1	I meant how to do it and stuff like that.
2014-12-05 21:42:55	Yoshi2	you take file A and replace it with file B and look at the results
2014-12-05 21:43:07	Shard1	But how to do THAT is the problem
2014-12-05 21:45:56	Yoshi2	it is slightly more difficult than how I described it because the files that you want to replace are quite often located in archive files which you need to decompress and unpack with tools people have written for dealing with nintendo file formats
2014-12-05 21:46:48	Shard1	exactly
2014-12-05 21:47:00	Shard1	I'm probably never going to get into that anyway
2014-12-05 21:48:50	Yoshi2	it does take quite a bit of effort 
2014-12-05 21:49:32	Yoshi2	and a bit of space on your HDD
2014-12-05 21:49:55	Yoshi2	I have two folders for the pikmin files, in one folder I have unpacked all the archive files using a script I wrote
2014-12-05 21:50:18	Yoshi2	the second one is for actually replacing files and rebuilding the iso file again
2014-12-05 21:50:20	Shard1	do you use an Xbox 360 controller to play them on dolphin?
2014-12-05 21:50:27	Yoshi2	yep
2014-12-05 21:50:36	Yoshi2	got one just for that
2014-12-05 21:50:38	Shard1	It's a lot more comfortable like that
2014-12-05 21:50:57	Shard1	keyboards not so bad, but Xbox controller is better
2014-12-05 21:51:27	Yoshi2	one of the buttons on the controller is becoming rather difficult to press repeatedly, though
2014-12-05 21:52:05	Yoshi2	I wonder if it is worth the effort to take it apart and look at the cause
2014-12-05 21:52:14	Shard1	probably not.
2014-12-05 21:52:26	Shard1	Do you really want to risk breaking you controller?
2014-12-05 21:53:29	Yoshi2	if it means that I can have a decently working button again, why not
2014-12-05 21:53:40	Yoshi2	I think it is out of warranty anyway
2014-12-05 21:53:52	Shard1	Well, you know best, it is your controller
2014-12-05 21:55:40	Yoshi2	and when I have the GC adapter for the Wii U, I can use the GC controller on my PC using that adapter
2014-12-05 21:55:51	Shard1	that really works?
2014-12-05 21:55:58	Yoshi2	I've heard that somebody already wrote a driver for the adapter
2014-12-05 21:57:57	Shard1	cool
2014-12-05 22:03:41	Shard1	Apparently some Wii Us are crashing because of For Glory in Smash bros. 
2014-12-05 22:06:07	Yoshi2	I've heard that the crashes are likely not caused by SSB, but by hardware issues
2014-12-05 22:07:05	Yoshi2	only one website reported such an issue, so it is likely a rare one
2014-12-05 22:07:38	Yoshi2	if it was a more widespread problem, you'd be hearing about it everywhere

2014-12-06 21:12:04	@Espyo	hi
2014-12-06 21:12:07	@Espyo	just came back from Comic Con
2014-12-06 21:12:36	Yoshi2	neat, how was it?

2014-12-06 21:30:30	@Espyo	it was a good day
2014-12-06 21:30:35	@Espyo	except for the Smash tournament
2014-12-06 21:30:40	@Espyo	everything was wrong about it
2014-12-06 21:30:47	@Espyo	it was 8-player ffa instead of 1v1
2014-12-06 21:31:00	@Espyo	you randomly got given a GCN controller or a Pro Controller
2014-12-06 21:31:06	@Espyo	and the button layout is quite different
2014-12-06 21:31:17	@Espyo	and I happened to get a Pro Controller, the one I'm not used to
2014-12-06 21:31:20	Yoshi2	D:
2014-12-06 21:31:21	@Espyo	so I fought terribly
2014-12-06 21:31:24	@Espyo	and to top it all off
2014-12-06 21:31:29	@Espyo	my controller was having trouble
2014-12-06 21:31:33	@Espyo	probably wireless interference
2014-12-06 21:31:39	@Espyo	holding a button acted as tapping it
2014-12-06 21:31:44	@Espyo	meaning I couldn't charge my attacks
2014-12-06 21:31:54	@Espyo	and at the end of the match, I gave up and started experimenting with the controller
2014-12-06 21:32:07	@Espyo	and by pressing B, Ike walked forward
2014-12-06 21:32:19	@Espyo	I pressed nothing but B; I was testing if I could charge his neutral-B
2014-12-06 21:32:23	@Espyo	and he goes to the right?
2014-12-06 21:32:26	@Espyo	that was seriously messed up
2014-12-06 21:32:34	@Espyo	complete lack of planning and horrible luck to boot
2014-12-06 21:32:42	@Espyo	that said, I did enter a Mario Kart 8 tourney
2014-12-06 21:32:47	@Espyo	I don't really play Mario Kart 8 much...
2014-12-06 21:32:50	@Espyo	but I got 2nd place overall
2014-12-06 21:33:01	@Espyo	and the dumb thing is that 1st, 2nd and 3rd places get the same rewards
2014-12-06 21:33:02	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-12-06 21:33:09	@Espyo	an Amiibo of their liking and another item on the table
2014-12-06 21:33:18	@Espyo	I guess the only advantage to being in first was getting to choose first
2014-12-06 21:33:26	@Espyo	I got a Marth Amiibo and Nintendo Land
2014-12-06 21:33:28	@Espyo	so I'm pretty pleased
2014-12-06 21:33:37	@Espyo	this is also probably the first and last Comic Con here
2014-12-06 21:33:44	@Espyo	despite the crappy tourney, it was a great hit
2014-12-06 21:33:53	@Espyo	...meaning our capital, Lisbon, is gonna pout and act jealous
2014-12-06 21:33:55	@Espyo	and take it from us
2014-12-06 21:34:01	@Espyo	just like they do with EVERYTHING we have
2014-12-06 21:34:10	@Espyo	next year, Comic Con will happen in Lisbon, no doubt
2014-12-06 21:34:21	Yoshi2	D:
2014-12-06 21:35:16	@Espyo	might as well focus on the good stuff
2014-12-06 21:35:18	@Espyo	and I did have fun
2014-12-06 21:35:21	@Espyo	so...
2014-12-06 21:38:33	Yoshi2	there used to be the Games Convention that was hosted in Leipzig, Germany
2014-12-06 21:39:18	Yoshi2	a few years ago, they reorganized a lot of stuff and it became the gamescom which is being hosted every year in Cologne
2014-12-06 21:39:54	Yoshi2	which is kinda awesome for me because it means that it is basically right next to me
2014-12-06 21:40:40	Yoshi2	but I rarely go to it for some reason
2014-12-06 21:41:52	Yoshi2	for some time, Nintendo didn't even take part in it, but I think they changed that already
2014-12-06 21:57:33	@Espyo	hehe
2014-12-06 21:57:38	@Espyo	oh, cool
2014-12-06 21:58:53	Yoshi2	I'm amazed at how useless google can be sometimes
2014-12-06 21:58:58	@Espyo	heh
2014-12-06 21:59:01	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-06 21:59:06	@Espyo	both incredible and useless
2014-12-06 21:59:08	@Espyo	sometimes at the same tim
2014-12-06 21:59:09	@Espyo	*e
2014-12-06 21:59:35	Yoshi2	I've tried to see if there was a list of configuration file formats
2014-12-06 21:59:51	Yoshi2	to see if anything matches the one used by pikmin 2
2014-12-06 22:00:16	@Espyo	mhm
2014-12-06 22:02:58	Yoshi2	haven't had much success yet, so I might have to write something myself
2014-12-06 22:04:42	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-12-06 22:05:13	Yoshi2	it wouldn't be difficult, but I would have to make guesses based off how the file looks like
2014-12-06 22:06:31	@Espyo	mhm
2014-12-06 22:10:28	@J	I think I already did that, somewhat
2014-12-06 22:10:59	Yoshi2	J: did you? I'd be interested in that
2014-12-06 22:12:53	@J	actually, looking at it, it's not very well-structured and rather specific to my use-case
2014-12-06 22:13:04	@J	it's a script to parse cave configs
2014-12-06 22:14:00	@J	http://sprunge.us/eNHL
2014-12-06 22:14:02	@J	does that
2014-12-06 22:14:07	@J	or MediaWiki formats
2014-12-06 22:14:28	Yoshi2	I see
2014-12-06 22:15:46	@J	hmm, doesn't look like there's really much to the consistent parts anyway
2014-12-06 22:16:04	@J	it's just {} with some lines inside, each some space-separated words
2014-12-06 22:16:32	@J	I just have a bit of code that grabs those and removes comments
2014-12-06 22:16:54	@J	well, here it is anyway: http://sprunge.us/IIOP
2014-12-06 22:19:16	Yoshi2	mhm, that's what I guessed
2014-12-06 22:20:12	@J	hmm, parse_sect looks like it could be adapted for most section types
2014-12-06 22:20:17	Yoshi2	I'll try to parse the file into a kind of python datastructure
2014-12-06 22:20:24	@J	it's pretty hard-to-read code, though
2014-12-06 22:20:51	@J	I mean, that's what my code is doing, then it generates different output strings from that
2014-12-06 22:21:00	@J	depends how good you want it to be, though
2014-12-06 22:22:20	Yoshi2	yeah, I will likely write it from scratch
2014-12-06 22:26:43	Yoshi2	I'll take a nap now, good night
2014-12-06 22:27:12	@J	bye
2014-12-06 22:27:41	@J	...sometimes my IRC setup doesn't refresh the screen properly, and your text there said 'good night force'
2014-12-06 22:27:56	@J	that should be your new goodbye
2014-12-06 22:30:21	Yoshi2	good night force

2014-12-06 23:32:49	@Espyo	hi
2014-12-06 23:35:43	@PikFan	oh, right
2014-12-06 23:35:57	@PikFan	you never got to see this https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lY7UHQGfShkaCFslwwFu_adN9CuVMqfqSdW0N23TXn9XkPkCqeH3DBDEjyQr2sOrOxiucQ=w1566-h620
2014-12-06 23:36:08	@Espyo	wha?!
2014-12-06 23:36:10	@Espyo	what's THAT?
2014-12-06 23:36:29	@PikFan	er, look in the lower left corner
2014-12-06 23:36:53	@PikFan	unfortunately it won't let me grab a bigger version
2014-12-06 23:37:18	@PikFan	but anyway, that's a map I drew
2014-12-06 23:37:30	@PikFan	of the first two subareas of the Distant Desert
2014-12-06 23:37:57	@PikFan	(could've made that one statement, but meh)
2014-12-06 23:40:47	@PikFan	this is better http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/5/57/Distant_Desert_map_01.jpg
2014-12-06 23:41:13	Testyo	[Fanon RC] File:Distant Desert map 01.jpg uploaded by PikFan23 (Map of the first two subareas in the [[Distant Desert]].) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=File:Distant_Desert_map_01.jpg
2014-12-06 23:42:32	@PikFan	oh, also, that line with the slashes in it is meant to separate the subareas
2014-12-06 23:42:59	@PikFan	so I've got some ideas for the Deceiving Desert
2014-12-06 23:43:26	@PikFan	it's going to be... rather large
2014-12-06 23:43:59	@PikFan	the main puzzle of the Deceiving Desert will be collecting fragments to build a bridge over a chasm
2014-12-06 23:44:12	@PikFan	thing is, though, you have to be careful of the desert's heat
2014-12-06 23:44:25	@PikFan	it makes it tricky
2014-12-06 23:44:51	@PikFan	the vastness of the desert will also put some distance between piles of fragments
2014-12-06 23:47:03	@PikFan	hmmm...
2014-12-06 23:47:20	@PikFan	I need to make the exploration section less ambiguous
2014-12-06 23:47:27	@PikFan	especially the exploration at night thing
2014-12-06 23:48:19	@PikFan	also, I may end up moving around some stuff in this map
2014-12-06 23:48:42	@PikFan	I'm not too fond that all the puzzle elements are right in the Landing Site
2014-12-06 23:51:49	@Espyo	oh
2014-12-06 23:51:50	@Espyo	that
2014-12-06 23:51:55	@Espyo	I'll be honest, you fooled me
2014-12-06 23:52:00	@Espyo	I thought that was official artwork
2014-12-06 23:52:02	@Espyo	it's so detailed!
2014-12-06 23:52:15	@PikFan	heh, really?
2014-12-06 23:52:40	@PikFan	I was going for detail, but I never imagined it'd be THAT detailed
2014-12-06 23:52:49	@Espyo	I'm honest
2014-12-06 23:53:09	@PikFan	also I'm probably going to leave it black and white
2014-12-06 23:53:21	@PikFan	if I tried coloring it, it might ruin it
2014-12-06 23:54:18	@PikFan	...bah
2014-12-06 23:54:26	@PikFan	forgot Burgeoning Spiderworts
2014-12-06 23:54:38	@PikFan	I JUST NOW realize this?!?
2014-12-06 23:57:12	@PikFan	wait what http://www.pikminwiki.com/Obstacle
2014-12-06 23:57:29	@PikFan	why does it say that bridges don't appear in P3?
2014-12-06 23:57:45	@PikFan	sure, they're different, but still bridges
2014-12-06 23:59:45	@Espyo	yeah, color might bust it
2014-12-06 23:59:50	@Espyo	it's a bit linear though, but I think it's meant to

2014-12-07 00:02:27	@Espyo	yeah, it should say bridges appear
2014-12-07 00:02:33	@Espyo	anyway, we NEED an article for each
2014-12-07 00:02:48	@PikFan	right, the yellow links...
2014-12-07 00:02:53	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-12-07 00:02:59	@Espyo	but I mean we need them as actual pages, each
2014-12-07 00:03:03	@Espyo	not redirects to [[Obstacle]]
2014-12-07 00:03:04	Testyo	"Obstacle" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Obstacle
2014-12-07 00:03:08	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2014-12-07 00:03:14	@Espyo	anyway, it's linear in that it doesn't have branching paths or changing heights
2014-12-07 00:03:25	@Espyo	but it does look like a pretty early-game area
2014-12-07 00:03:29	@Espyo	so it's meant to be linear
2014-12-07 00:03:38	@PikFan	yeah
2014-12-07 00:03:46	@PikFan	it's what, the 4th area found?
2014-12-07 00:03:50	@Espyo	hm
2014-12-07 00:04:03	@PikFan	but this is in Part I
2014-12-07 00:04:07	@Espyo	right
2014-12-07 00:04:08	@PikFan	Part I is linear
2014-12-07 00:04:18	@PikFan	Part II will have some flexibility
2014-12-07 00:04:30	@PikFan	even though I originally made it linear
2014-12-07 00:04:52	@PikFan	anyway, about the obstacles
2014-12-07 00:05:02	@PikFan	since there's an image tag, should we add a gallery?
2014-12-07 00:05:50	@Espyo	all right
2014-12-07 00:05:59	@Espyo	image tag?
2014-12-07 00:06:22	@PikFan	yeah, there's an image tag on [[Obstacles]]
2014-12-07 00:06:23	Testyo	"Obstacles" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Obstacles
2014-12-07 00:06:37	@PikFan	er, [[Obstacle]]

2014-12-07 00:06:49	@Espyo	hmm
2014-12-07 00:07:07	@Espyo	no, we
2014-12-07 00:07:16	@Espyo	we need an article for bridge, one for cardboard box, etc.
2014-12-07 00:07:37	@Espyo	and they shouldn't be all of them in the same page
2014-12-07 00:07:43	@Espyo	like the current [[Obstacle/merge]]
2014-12-07 00:07:43	Testyo	"Obstacle/merge" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Obstacle/merge
2014-12-07 00:08:21	@Espyo	off-topic, but I got an idea recently
2014-12-07 00:08:27	@Espyo	the engine will be complex and ambitious
2014-12-07 00:08:28	@Espyo	but
2014-12-07 00:08:32	@Espyo	I was wondering
2014-12-07 00:08:38	@Espyo	for one thing, NOBODY will make fangames on the engine
2014-12-07 00:08:39	@Espyo	I just know it
2014-12-07 00:08:45	@Espyo	I'm fine with it because I'll still make my own
2014-12-07 00:08:53	@Espyo	so as long as the internet has one Pikmin fangame, all is good
2014-12-07 00:08:55	@Espyo	but I realized
2014-12-07 00:09:03	@Espyo	I should try to also make a super lite, super simple engine
2014-12-07 00:09:54	@PikFan	16:08	Espyo	for one thing, NOBODY will make fangames on the engine
2014-12-07 00:10:00	@PikFan	that may or may not be true
2014-12-07 00:10:25	@PikFan	I might try to make my game playable
2014-12-07 00:10:32	@PikFan	though I'd have to rework so many things...
2014-12-07 00:11:08	@PikFan	the areas would have major differences
2014-12-07 00:11:19	@PikFan	as would the caves
2014-12-07 00:12:06	@PikFan	also, the super lite, super simple engine idea sounds interesting
2014-12-07 00:12:53	@PikFan	makes Pikmin minigames on it
2014-12-07 00:15:25	@Espyo	very likely that nobody will
2014-12-07 00:15:39	@Espyo	mhm
2014-12-07 00:15:46	@Espyo	like, instead of these complex collisions I've got going
2014-12-07 00:15:48	@Espyo	make it tile-based
2014-12-07 00:15:52	@Espyo	it's a lot easier to work with
2014-12-07 00:15:58	@Espyo	and simpler collisions and such
2014-12-07 00:16:05	@PikFan	ooh, speaking of the engine
2014-12-07 00:16:09	@Espyo	problem is this won't allow as much customization
2014-12-07 00:16:10	@PikFan	how's it going?
2014-12-07 00:16:15	@PikFan	right, right
2014-12-07 00:16:19	@Espyo	still haven't touched it recently
2014-12-07 00:16:27	@Espyo	except for a few times where I just scan my code again and again
2014-12-07 00:16:29	@PikFan	mm
2014-12-07 00:16:30	@Espyo	I'll pick it up really soon
2014-12-07 00:16:34	@Espyo	I'm starting to clear my todo list
2014-12-07 00:16:53	@PikFan	also, how's the KopPad theme doing?
2014-12-07 00:17:00	@Espyo	so I just want to work on important wiki stuff first
2014-12-07 00:17:07	@Espyo	KopPad theme will enter beta when I ask Porple
2014-12-07 00:17:34	@PikFan	so it will be kinda live
2014-12-07 00:21:26	@Espyo	meaning we have to decide the poll extension to use first
2014-12-07 00:21:52	@Espyo	sorry I took so long to reply
2014-12-07 00:21:56	@Espyo	I tried to type, but I was on Smash
2014-12-07 00:22:02	@Espyo	but of course I can't trust my BACKSTABBING FRIENDS
2014-12-07 00:22:05	@Espyo	told them to not KO me
2014-12-07 00:22:08	@Espyo	first thing they do is KO me
2014-12-07 00:22:10	@PikFan	hehehehehehehe
2014-12-07 00:22:22	@PikFan	don't you just LOVE friends?
2014-12-07 00:22:43	@Espyo	yyyyyyyyyup
2014-12-07 00:22:45	@PikFan	time for revenge
2014-12-07 00:23:05	@PikFan	ooh, so the new Zelda was revealed
2014-12-07 00:23:12	@PikFan	and the world is enormous
2014-12-07 00:23:16	@Espyo	mhm, I saw
2014-12-07 00:24:14	@PikFan	looks a little bit like Xenoblade
2014-12-07 00:28:48	@Espyo	people say it'll be like Skyrim in terms of hugeness
2014-12-07 00:28:49	@Espyo	sure hope so

2014-12-07 17:04:53	Yoshi2	I'm struggling a bit to think of a way to solve my programming homework, so I might as well just work on the config parser
2014-12-07 17:05:14	Yoshi2	I wonder how I should name the project
2014-12-07 17:06:06	Yoshi2	NinConfig, or PikConfig
2014-12-07 17:11:42	@Espyo	hehe
2014-12-07 17:12:40	Yoshi2	but unless more games use the config format, there is little point in calling it "NinSomething"
2014-12-07 17:18:44	Yoshi2	Pikmin 1 seems to use a somewhat similar config file format
2014-12-07 17:19:07	Yoshi2	SMS and Wind Waker don't seem to use any config files at all though, so I will leave it at this
2014-12-07 17:19:39	Yoshi2	PikConfig it is, I guess
2014-12-07 17:21:39	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-07 17:29:11	Yoshi2	hm, I do not think that Pikmin 1 uses the same config format as Pikmin 2
2014-12-07 17:29:42	Yoshi2	Pik1 uses // for comments, Pik2 uses # for comments
2014-12-07 17:35:03	Yoshi2	oh well, I might write a different parser for Pik1 at some point
2014-12-07 18:18:33	Yoshi2	what makes me wonder is why Pik2 config files sometimes have values inside brackets which are located on the same line
2014-12-07 18:18:43	Yoshi2	e.g. {0001}
2014-12-07 18:19:21	Yoshi2	I am not sure if that serves any special function

2014-12-07 18:29:44	Yoshi2	I've just copied over every ini/txt file from pikmin 2 so that I have more examples of data
2014-12-07 18:30:11	Yoshi2	it's really odd, Pikmin 1 config files looked much easier to parse
2014-12-07 18:30:58	Yoshi2	Pik1 also had a neater file structure, I think
2014-12-07 18:32:53	@Espyo	Pikmin 1 config files?
2014-12-07 18:32:55	@Espyo	it had config files?
2014-12-07 18:33:10	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure
2014-12-07 18:33:49	Yoshi2	otherwise I'd have to doubt myself because I copied some Pik1 config files just a moment ago

2014-12-07 20:54:14	Yoshi2	having separate articles for such minor characters might be a bit too much
2014-12-07 20:54:19	@PikFan	...wait
2014-12-07 20:54:21	Yoshi2	the article would look very empty
2014-12-07 20:54:38	@PikFan	isn't the Ship from P2 a character?
2014-12-07 20:54:40	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-07 20:54:51	@Espyo	well yeah, but it's not a minor one
2014-12-07 20:55:03	@Espyo	speaking of the ship, earlier today we discussed its official name
2014-12-07 20:55:07	Yoshi2	the ship from P2 talks a lot 
2014-12-07 20:55:08	@PikFan	right, I know, I kinda veered off topic
2014-12-07 20:55:15	@Espyo	in general, it's "the ship", but that's kind of a nickname
2014-12-07 20:55:27	@Espyo	then US Pikmin 3 and the Smash games call it Hocotate ship
2014-12-07 20:55:33	@Espyo	not EU Pikmin 3
2014-12-07 20:55:38	@Espyo	so the canon of that is kinda debatable
2014-12-07 20:55:47	@Espyo	then AeroBlaze said he saw Hocotate Freight ship somehwere
2014-12-07 20:55:48	@Espyo	*somewhere
2014-12-07 20:55:58	@Espyo	on top of that, some people might call it Hocotate Bomb because of the Smash 4 item
2014-12-07 20:55:59	@PikFan	by the way, I liked [[Pikipedia:Canon]]

2014-12-07 20:56:10	@Espyo	read my latest two policies
2014-12-07 20:56:13	@Espyo	and double-check, please
2014-12-07 20:59:46	@PikFan	"Fragments are ceramic tiles that are used to build bridges in Pikmin 3. Fragments are clustered together in piles, and the Pikmin will carry them to the bridge of the corresponding Fragment color, then return to the pile. Bridges vary from being made of 15 to 80 Fragments, and often times, bridges. Fragments are occasionally buried in Dirt Mounds or encased 
2014-12-07 20:59:56	@PikFan	 inside Crystals. In one case, in the Garden of Hope, there is a overturned plant pot made of Fragments; when finished, it is used as a platform to throw leaders across."
2014-12-07 20:59:59	@PikFan	how's that?
2014-12-07 21:00:35	@PikFan	also I'm leaving a todo tag to list the locations of piles of fragments
2014-12-07 21:02:14	@Espyo	seems fine
2014-12-07 21:02:24	@Espyo	>, and often times, bridges.
2014-12-07 21:02:25	@Espyo	what
2014-12-07 21:02:33	@PikFan	oh, right
2014-12-07 21:02:54	@PikFan	I was going to finish that sentence then got distracted
2014-12-07 21:02:57	@Espyo	heh
2014-12-07 21:03:06	@Espyo	come to think of it, it'd be better to explain Fragments inside the Bridge article
2014-12-07 21:03:22	@Espyo	it DEFINITELY doesn't warrant its own article
2014-12-07 21:03:27	@PikFan	yeah
2014-12-07 21:03:28	@Espyo	and the bridge article would be small without it
2014-12-07 21:03:34	@PikFan	but locations
2014-12-07 21:03:51	@Espyo	you should also mention how Pikmin stay at the pile, even if there are no more fragments there
2014-12-07 21:03:58	@Espyo	and how whistling a fragment-carrying Pikmin makes it disappear
2014-12-07 21:04:05	@Espyo	and also how the player can push the Pikmin to speed them up
2014-12-07 21:04:11	@Espyo	don't forget to add these small details
2014-12-07 21:04:19	@Espyo	it's the difference between a friend just explaining to another what a fragment is
2014-12-07 21:04:27	@Espyo	and an encyclopedia that details what a fragment is
2014-12-07 21:06:12	@PikFan	"Bridges vary from being made of 15 to 80 Fragments, and usually, bridges have multiple piles of Fragments that need to be assembled."
2014-12-07 21:06:38	@PikFan	is there ever a bridge that has only one fragment pile?
2014-12-07 21:08:07	@Espyo	the first one
2014-12-07 21:08:25	@PikFan	the first one has two, iirc
2014-12-07 21:08:32	@PikFan	one with 3, the other with 12
2014-12-07 21:08:43	@Espyo	the one before Alph's KopPad?
2014-12-07 21:08:45	Yoshi2	I think one of the missions has a bridge with a single fragment pile
2014-12-07 21:08:47	@PikFan	mhm
2014-12-07 21:09:32	@PikFan	but we're doing just story mode bridges
2014-12-07 21:09:42	@Espyo	we should probably do mission mode too
2014-12-07 21:09:43	@PikFan	...though we should include mission as well
2014-12-07 21:09:44	@Espyo	for completion's sake
2014-12-07 21:09:47	@PikFan	right
2014-12-07 21:09:51	@Espyo	anyway, I've seen speedruns recently
2014-12-07 21:09:56	@Espyo	it's still kinda fresh in my mind
2014-12-07 21:10:01	@Espyo	the first bridge has one pile
2014-12-07 21:10:06	@Espyo	and you have 4 Pikmin to work on it
2014-12-07 21:10:09	@Espyo	worth a re-check, though
2014-12-07 21:10:13	@Espyo	I'm doing dinner, so...
2014-12-07 21:10:14	@Espyo	you do it
2014-12-07 21:16:02	@Espyo	PikFan: quick
2014-12-07 21:16:09	@Espyo	what is the name of the function on the Drake
2014-12-07 21:16:12	@Espyo	where the leaders talk?
2014-12-07 21:16:34	@PikFan	Check-in, I think
2014-12-07 21:16:50	@Espyo	I think that's it, thanks
2014-12-07 21:16:53	@PikFan	minus the hyphen
2014-12-07 21:18:46	@PikFan	yep, two separate piles
2014-12-07 21:19:02	@PikFan	but they're so close to each other it's basically one
2014-12-07 21:19:02	@Espyo	mh
2014-12-07 21:21:51	Testyo	I... suppose play that card
2014-12-07 21:22:03	@PikFan	?
2014-12-07 21:24:10	@Espyo	he probably wants cah
2014-12-07 21:27:04	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2014-12-07 21:27:04	Testyo	I said I... suppose play that card because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages I... suppose it does and you may not play that card.
2014-12-07 21:27:43	Yoshi2	I have no idea how that message was created

2014-12-08 10:10:19	Yoshi2	the parser even attempts to preserve comments from the original file, and you can add your own comments when adding items

2014-12-08 12:23:15	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2014-12-08 12:27:23	@Espyo	hi
2014-12-08 12:28:38	Yoshi2	I was a bit busy with writing a parser for the config files: https://github.com/RenolY2/pikConfig/blob/master/pik2Config.py
2014-12-08 12:28:59	Yoshi2	it even attempts to keep comments from the parsed files, and you can specify your own comments when adding items
2014-12-08 12:29:26	Yoshi2	still needs to be tested though
2014-12-08 12:29:43	Yoshi2	I'll also have to write documentation for it
2014-12-08 12:30:15	@Espyo	oh, nice
2014-12-08 12:30:21	@Espyo	heh
2014-12-08 12:30:27	@Espyo	good code documents itself, remember that
2014-12-08 12:30:57	Yoshi2	even self-documenting code can only tell the what, but not the why
2014-12-08 12:31:26	Yoshi2	ehhm
2014-12-08 12:31:29	@Espyo	sometimes
2014-12-08 12:31:37	Yoshi2	that was with comments
2014-12-08 12:31:46	@Espyo	still, I think that for now, just having comments in it to explain harder things is enough
2014-12-08 12:32:01	@Espyo	don't waste your time doing javadoc-like documentation
2014-12-08 12:33:22	Yoshi2	but without proper documentation the code feels unfinished
2014-12-08 12:37:04	Yoshi2	it would be interesting to have an automatic translatoion of all the config files
2014-12-08 12:37:32	@Espyo	it does, but how much of your life are you willing to give away for that .1%?
2014-12-08 12:37:41	@Espyo	... .1% that takes 20% of the time to make
2014-12-08 12:37:54	@Espyo	hm, you mean hook it up to Google Translate?
2014-12-08 12:38:00	@Espyo	remember to cache stuff, or Google will hate it
2014-12-08 12:38:47	Yoshi2	the documentation would take maybe 1 hour at most to create
2014-12-08 12:39:07	@Espyo	how small will the final code be?
2014-12-08 12:39:14	@Espyo	and how modular, really
2014-12-08 12:39:19	@Espyo	if you only have one function, do_everything()
2014-12-08 12:39:24	@Espyo	then I guess it takes like 1 minute to document
2014-12-08 12:39:42	Yoshi2	what you see in my github link is how it will be
2014-12-08 12:40:24	Yoshi2	a config class, one function to create a config object from a file, and one function to put the config object into a file
2014-12-08 12:41:08	@Espyo	hm
2014-12-08 12:41:08	Yoshi2	what would require documentation is how to work with the config object
2014-12-08 12:41:14	Yoshi2	the rest is quite simple
2014-12-08 12:41:17	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-12-08 12:46:18	Yoshi2	if I don't do it sooner than later, chances are, I will never come back to it because writing pikmin2 config files is not exactly something I do every day
2014-12-08 12:46:32	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-08 12:59:00	Yoshi2	when I was poking around in the pikmin 2 config files, I saw two different config files for the 9th vs level
2014-12-08 12:59:19	Yoshi2	I wonder if they differ in any way other than their name
2014-12-08 13:00:05	@Espyo	uhm
2014-12-08 13:00:12	@Espyo	if that's the maze one
2014-12-08 13:00:24	@Espyo	I think it's because most 2PB levels have 3 layouts they can choose from
2014-12-08 13:00:34	@Espyo	as opposed to normal caves, that have a bunch of pieces they can pick from
2014-12-08 13:00:43	@Espyo	but the maze one (probably 9th) DOES act like a normal cave
2014-12-08 13:00:46	@Espyo	but initially wasn't meant to
2014-12-08 13:00:56	@Espyo	...meaning that file is unused and I didn't stick it in TCRF yet
2014-12-08 13:03:11	Yoshi2	I thought I copied the file onto this notebook, but it doesn't seem like it
2014-12-08 13:03:23	Yoshi2	going to have to check it when I'm back home
2014-12-08 13:04:08	Yoshi2	the first file contains "meiro", and I'm pretty sure there was a second file for the 9th vs level that had a name that started with "t"
2014-12-08 13:04:28	Yoshi2	tsuchi
2014-12-08 13:04:38	Yoshi2	that was it
2014-12-08 13:04:59	Yoshi2	the meiro file references the tsuchi file though
2014-12-08 13:05:52	@Espyo	tsuchi means dirt
2014-12-08 13:05:54	@Espyo	a dirt layout
2014-12-08 13:05:59	@Espyo	yeah, it's a big mess
2014-12-08 13:06:03	@Espyo	let me refresh my mind
2014-12-08 13:08:11	Yoshi2	in Japanese, every word sounds like a name 
2014-12-08 13:08:16	@Espyo	hehe
2014-12-08 13:08:27	@Espyo	hm, can't really make heads or toes about the files
2014-12-08 13:08:34	@Espyo	my mind isn't in the right place for it right now, I guess
2014-12-08 13:08:55	Yoshi2	no worries
2014-12-08 13:09:07	Yoshi2	my mind is currently in the world of maths
2014-12-08 13:09:13	Yoshi2	hooray for homework

2014-12-08 15:14:06	@Espyo	hang on, I scrolled up
2014-12-08 15:14:19	@Espyo	I know you said something, but if I scroll down to read it, I'll lose the point I'm on
2014-12-08 15:15:05	Yoshi2	fair enough
2014-12-08 15:21:09	@Espyo	aaaahhh what a horrible mistake to make Yoshi2
2014-12-08 15:21:28	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-12-08 15:21:42	@Espyo	at least it's fixed
2014-12-08 15:22:06	Yoshi2	but it wasn't a mistake inside the module
2014-12-08 15:22:31	Yoshi2	I called the load function with a string instead of a file object, so it was a mistake in how I used it

2014-12-08 20:05:35	@J	documentation is pretty much the most important thing
2014-12-08 20:05:48	@J	if people have to read your code to know how to use it, they won't use it
2014-12-08 20:06:04	@J	if you have to read your code to understand how to use it, you'll waste 5 minutes every time you do so
2014-12-08 20:06:19	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-08 20:06:27	@Espyo	but being so petty that you document every single thing about every single line
2014-12-08 20:06:31	@Espyo	that's...
2014-12-08 20:06:38	@Espyo	well, if you want to do that, at least leave it for a bit later
2014-12-08 20:06:58	@J	you said 'javadoc' documentation
2014-12-08 20:07:10	@J	which, to me, means documenting functions, classes, methods, types, etc.
2014-12-08 20:09:35	@J	I'll read the rest and look at the thing after food
2014-12-08 20:11:07	@Espyo	yup
2014-12-08 20:15:17	@J	and someone needs to come up with a name for my Dustforce level: http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/out-dustforce-2014-12-08_19.56.41.mkv
2014-12-08 20:17:07	@Espyo	I thought you already did
2014-12-08 20:18:04	@Espyo	that long wait at the start is gonna be the epitome of annoying
2014-12-08 20:28:32	@J	this is clearly a different level
2014-12-08 20:28:57	@J	and yeah, but it's kind of necessary for the any%, in which you go below the starting platform and climb on the right
2014-12-08 20:29:44	@Espyo	hm
2014-12-08 20:29:54	@Espyo	anyway, like before, maybe waiting would be better
2014-12-08 20:29:59	@Espyo	I got nothing other than "Long Start"
2014-12-08 20:30:35	@J	waiting for what?

2014-12-08 20:30:56	@Espyo	for that crystal thing to reach the left so you can climb up
2014-12-08 20:32:01	@J	wait, so waiting would be better than what?
2014-12-08 20:32:10	@J	and what do you mean, 'like before'?
2014-12-08 20:32:12	@J	I'm really lost
2014-12-08 20:32:33	@Espyo	not waiting would be better than waiting
2014-12-08 20:32:47	@Espyo	and "like before" as in "like the last level you made"
2014-12-08 20:32:55	@Espyo	oh, I see how you're confused
2014-12-08 20:32:57	@J	now I'm even more confused
2014-12-08 20:32:58	@Espyo	uh, let me try again
2014-12-08 20:33:02	@Espyo	forget it all
2014-12-08 20:33:15	@Espyo	the part where you have to wait at the start of this level will be annoying for people trying to perfect it
2014-12-08 20:33:33	@Espyo	and now, as for the name you should give it
2014-12-08 20:33:48	@Espyo	I think it's better to wait until the level is more complete before we come up with a name, same as before (the previous level)
2014-12-08 20:33:58	@J	it's super 100% complete
2014-12-08 20:34:24	@Espyo	it's crushingly simpler than the previous one
2014-12-08 20:34:31	@Espyo	call it...
2014-12-08 20:34:33	@Espyo	Burster
2014-12-08 20:34:41	@Espyo	'cause you have to burst those things to jump up some more
2014-12-08 20:34:52	@Espyo	and it'll burst people's forehead veins having to wait at the start

2014-12-08 20:35:50	@J	simpler decoration-wise, yeah
2014-12-08 20:35:55	@J	decoration is boring
2014-12-08 20:36:20	@J	I had a great idea about how it should look, then the way the colouring stuff works meant I couldn't do it
2014-12-08 20:36:27	@J	so I got sad and whacked those tiles in
2014-12-08 20:36:42	@J	Yoshi2: I am now going to complain about all your code
2014-12-08 20:36:43	@Espyo	heh
2014-12-08 20:37:03	@J	first thing, you should be using Python 3 now; it's a lot better
2014-12-08 20:37:48	@J	you have some random snake-case/camel-case usage which makes me feel a bit sick
2014-12-08 20:38:04	@J	actually, I'm actually ill, so
2014-12-08 20:38:05	@J	sicker
2014-12-08 20:38:06	@J	I guess
2014-12-08 20:38:15	@J	also " instead of '
2014-12-08 20:38:42	@J	Python is great because it has an official style guide, so everyone should follow it
2014-12-08 20:39:34	@J	did you mean __repr__ instead of _repr?

2014-12-08 20:44:53	@Espyo	nah, I kid
2014-12-08 20:44:59	@Espyo	precisely, " is for speech
2014-12-08 20:45:07	@Espyo	and... you're using a worded literal
2014-12-08 20:45:10	@Espyo	that's... close enough
2014-12-08 20:45:19	@Espyo	' is an apostrophe
2014-12-08 20:45:28	@Espyo	I guess you could say it's a single quote
2014-12-08 20:45:34	@Espyo	but historically, nobody really ever used single quotes
2014-12-08 20:45:36	@Espyo	did they?
2014-12-08 20:45:49	@J	no, I mean, when you write prose, you use " for speech and ' for non-speech quotes

2014-12-08 20:46:20	@J	I mean, " are sometimes called 'speech marks'
2014-12-08 20:46:30	@J	at least in England
2014-12-08 20:49:59	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-08 20:50:07	@Espyo	anyway, code isn't narration, so I'm indifferent
2014-12-08 20:50:28	@Espyo	plus, ' is easier to type (less keys), and in smaller fonts, it can't be mistaken for like an asterisk
2014-12-08 20:50:48	@Espyo	but C doesn't allow you to use apostrophes, so...
2014-12-08 20:51:29	@J	yeah, we should make all stylistic choices based on 50+-year-old languages

2014-12-09 20:41:07	@PikFan	on Fanon, should there be canon navboxes?
2014-12-09 20:41:18	@Espyo	depends
2014-12-09 20:41:23	@PikFan	I'm against it, but...
2014-12-09 20:41:44	@PikFan	it might be useful to show what enemies are canon and which ones are not
2014-12-09 20:43:22	@Espyo	can you give me an example of a navbox?

2014-12-09 20:46:18	@Espyo	hm
2014-12-09 20:46:25	@PikFan	also, I had some ideas for my game banner earlier
2014-12-09 20:46:29	@Espyo	it would make a lot more sense to have a navbox with all enemies, canon or fanon
2014-12-09 20:46:56	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I'm thinking, but it would be /huge/
2014-12-09 20:47:24	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-12-09 20:47:33	@Espyo	hmm
2014-12-09 20:47:42	@PikFan	anyway, so I was thinking I could add some parameters to my banner that would categorize pages
2014-12-09 20:48:28	@PikFan	like, if my banner was on an area page, I could add |area and it would categorize that to PCW Areas
2014-12-09 20:49:14	@PikFan	also, I think I have at least one navbox for my game
2014-12-09 20:49:19	@PikFan	I need to add more
2014-12-09 20:49:45	@PikFan	...is it possible to make a template make another template appear somewhere else on the page?
2014-12-09 20:50:09	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-09 20:50:16	@Espyo	hmm
2014-12-09 20:50:21	@Espyo	make another template appear somewhere else? nope

2014-12-10 19:41:22	@Espyo	>Miles claims he has a glitched memory card that causes the game to display the day as "Day 255" and automatically ends the game when the day ends.

2014-12-10 20:41:34	@PikFan	what I was going to say is that I expanded the Fanon's canon policy

2014-12-10 20:41:55	@Espyo	oh, good
2014-12-10 20:42:27	@PikFan	Cheepy keeps taking out the how to sections in the canon enemies' pages
2014-12-10 20:42:36	@Espyo	people on Skype said that Miles once had a broken save for P1, where he was on day 255, and the game just ended the second the day started
2014-12-10 20:42:44	@Espyo	well, he should
2014-12-10 20:42:52	@Espyo	why would you waste space and time on a section that's just a mirror
2014-12-10 20:43:16	@PikFan	but
2014-12-10 20:43:42	@PikFan	enemy pages without a strategy guide just look... jarring
2014-12-10 20:43:52	@PikFan	and what
2014-12-10 20:44:08	@PikFan	a... broken save?
2014-12-10 20:44:19	@PikFan	P1? day 255?
2014-12-10 20:44:27	@PikFan	why

2014-12-10 20:44:49	@Espyo	no idea
2014-12-10 20:44:59	@Espyo	Miles hasn't proven or disproven it yet
2014-12-10 20:45:09	@Espyo	they posted this speedrun on skype, too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZWb42PgH1U

2014-12-10 20:47:45	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard to memory edit to get day 255
2014-12-10 20:47:50	@PikFan	hmm
2014-12-10 20:48:01	@Espyo	Yoshi2: the save file VERY likely uses a checksum

2014-12-10 20:49:55	Yoshi2	Espyo: another way could be to create a cheat
2014-12-10 20:50:28	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-10 20:50:41	@Espyo	hm... if it works
2014-12-10 20:50:49	@Espyo	the thing might happen when the game tries to load on day 255
2014-12-10 20:51:00	@Espyo	by using a code, you could start on day 255 immediately...
2014-12-10 20:51:04	@Espyo	but something tells me it wouldn't work
2014-12-10 20:51:15	Yoshi2	solution: start on day 254
2014-12-10 20:51:18	@Espyo	other than that, you could try playing on day 254 an--
2014-12-10 20:51:19	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-10 20:51:25	@Espyo	until you reach the end of the day, and hope to get day 255
2014-12-10 20:51:31	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-12-10 20:51:37	@Espyo	and then you realize the game does the bad ending if you're on day 30+
2014-12-10 20:51:44	@Espyo	then again, it's Nintendo
2014-12-10 20:51:48	@Espyo	it could easily only have a check JUST for day 30

2014-12-11 19:21:35	@Espyo	heh
2014-12-11 19:23:10	@J	so, it turns out I'm actually a ninja
2014-12-11 19:23:21	@J	I was cutting green beans on the work top above the washing machine
2014-12-11 19:23:33	@J	one fell off, and I pushed my leg forwards
2014-12-11 19:23:43	@J	it hit my thigh, then bounced towards the washing machine
2014-12-11 19:23:58	@J	then my leg hit the washing machine door and trapped the bean in the edge of the door
2014-12-11 19:24:06	@J	perfectly catching it, and not damaging it at all
2014-12-11 19:24:52	Yoshi2	well, that is impressive
2014-12-11 19:25:32	Yoshi2	round things have a tendency to bounce off towards a place where you will never find it again
2014-12-11 19:25:50	@J	green bean = not round
2014-12-11 19:26:19	@Espyo	how even

2014-12-11 19:29:23	Yoshi2	I guess my mind passed over the green part and went straight to "bean = round"
2014-12-11 19:30:02	Yoshi2	well, round-ish
2014-12-11 19:34:47	Yoshi2	I'm at the point in the config module where I am not sure whether I should use normal python datatypes, or write my own class for containing data 
2014-12-11 19:36:08	Yoshi2	currently, if the config file contains a line like "{something} value1 value2 value3", I store it in a list as ["{something}", "value1", "value2", "value3"]
2014-12-11 19:36:20	@J	you should make a class that represents a section parser, and you create it with the information required to parse a section of a specific type
2014-12-11 19:38:34	Yoshi2	I've thought about keeping things simple and just put each line of the config file as an item in a list, except when the line contains only { or }
2014-12-11 19:38:34	@J	also, lines aren't actually standalone
2014-12-11 19:38:44	@J	they depend on context, ie. what lines come before
2014-12-11 19:40:46	Yoshi2	yes, there are groups of data which seem to have a particular format
2014-12-11 19:41:33	Yoshi2	e.g. {identifier}, {thing1}, {thing2}, ..., {_eof}
2014-12-11 19:42:26	Yoshi2	in another format, the first line in a {} block seems to contain the number of items in the block, and each item appears to be two lines
2014-12-11 19:43:14	@J	so some way of defining what a section means would be nice - otherwise all you've got is a section parser, but if that's all you wanted I guess that's fine
2014-12-11 19:43:47	Yoshi2	but detecting that context would blow the parsing code up for no practical reason, I think it'd be better to do some post-processing in a different module
2014-12-11 19:47:31	Yoshi2	I think I will create a fancy class for storing data about a single line
2014-12-11 19:48:07	Yoshi2	currently, I store the content of the line, the in-line comment and any block of comments that comes before the line
2014-12-11 20:00:18	@Espyo	J: read the policies I wrote ASAP

2014-12-11 20:24:31	@Espyo	it's accurate, but... so weird, compared to "template"

2014-12-11 20:27:44	Yoshi2	well, wikipedia does have a list page which lists lists which contain lists
2014-12-11 20:28:02	Yoshi2	I guess "template template" is a special kind of wiki humour
2014-12-11 20:28:32	@J	the problem is it's a different kind of template
2014-12-11 20:28:48	@J	in 'list of lists', both mentions of the word 'list' mean the same thing
2014-12-11 20:29:06	@J	here, we have a 'blank template' for a 'MediaWiki template'

2014-12-11 20:30:11	@Espyo	problem with making these policies... or any article, really

2014-12-13 21:00:51	@Espyo	of blue Pikmin, I reckon
2014-12-13 21:01:00	@PikFan	hm
2014-12-13 21:01:00	@Espyo	anyway, the skype folk were discussing an idea for infoboxes
2014-12-13 21:01:05	@Espyo	enemy infoboxes, I mean
2014-12-13 21:01:12	@Espyo	two things
2014-12-13 21:01:25	@Espyo	first, some enemies have multiple distinct looks
2014-12-13 21:01:38	@Espyo	so making it so the infobox can accept more than one pic, that can be toggled would be a good idea
2014-12-13 21:01:45	@Espyo	a bit like how... uh...
2014-12-13 21:01:49	@Espyo	{{infobox mission}} does it

2014-12-13 21:02:49	@Espyo	all right, like THAT http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_mission&oldid=141477
2014-12-13 21:03:25	@PikFan	yeah, I get what you were trying to say
2014-12-13 21:03:51	@Espyo	but anyway, it's a no-brainer, that's a good idea
2014-12-13 21:03:59	@Espyo	for stuff like the Titan Dweevil, Waterwraith, etc.
2014-12-13 21:04:04	@Espyo	oh, and Figworts
2014-12-13 21:04:13	@PikFan	and Iridescent Flint Beetles
2014-12-13 21:04:17	@Espyo	and Glowstems
2014-12-13 21:04:24	@Espyo	right, I'm not sure about per-game looks
2014-12-13 21:04:30	@Espyo	but yeah, probably would be a good idea, too
2014-12-13 21:04:41	@Espyo	anyway, second idea
2014-12-13 21:04:52	@PikFan	I thought you had meant on a per-game basis
2014-12-13 21:05:01	@Espyo	well, that wouldn't fit with the examples I gave
2014-12-13 21:05:08	@PikFan	right, right
2014-12-13 21:05:15	@Espyo	on wikia, they had the list of areas on the infobox slightly separated by game
2014-12-13 21:05:27	@Espyo	like '''Pikmin''' bla bla
2014-12-13 21:05:32	@Espyo	'''Pikmin 2''' abc abc
2014-12-13 21:05:34	@Espyo	etc
2014-12-13 21:05:45	@PikFan	hmm, I agree with that
2014-12-13 21:05:48	@Espyo	I figured we could have like we have on some enemy's seed values, HP values, etc.
2014-12-13 21:05:51	@Espyo	and have an icon instead
2014-12-13 21:05:57	@Espyo	then I also suggested a crazy idea
2014-12-13 21:06:03	@Espyo	what if the infobox was actually a table
2014-12-13 21:06:08	@PikFan	that system needs to be implemented into Fanon's templates bad
2014-12-13 21:06:15	@PikFan	whoa, what
2014-12-13 21:06:16	@Espyo	with the first column be the name of the attribute
2014-12-13 21:06:23	@Espyo	and the others have one per game
2014-12-13 21:06:28	@Espyo	...but then I realized it looks horrible
2014-12-13 21:06:32	@Espyo	plus it won't work for half the attributes
2014-12-13 21:06:34	@Espyo	like family name
2014-12-13 21:06:39	@Espyo	but in doing so, I realized...
2014-12-13 21:06:43	@Espyo	no matter how we do it
2014-12-13 21:06:56	@Espyo	the list of areas, caves, multiplayer and challenge stages...
2014-12-13 21:07:00	@Espyo	will always be enormous
2014-12-13 21:07:04	@Espyo	and cluttere
2014-12-13 21:07:04	@Espyo	*d
2014-12-13 21:07:07	@Espyo	and kind of messy
2014-12-13 21:07:18	@Espyo	so we discussed the idea of getting rid of locations on the infobox
2014-12-13 21:07:21	@PikFan	can't you just hide it?
2014-12-13 21:07:29	@Espyo	and focusing solely on the Locations section of the article
2014-12-13 21:07:29	@PikFan	like with navboxes?
2014-12-13 21:07:32	@Espyo	hmm, I think we can hide it
2014-12-13 21:07:38	@Espyo	might work a bit poorly with infoboxes, but sure
2014-12-13 21:07:56	@Espyo	even still, that's a lot of things for an infobox
2014-12-13 21:08:09	@Espyo	the idea of an infobox is to have quick snippets of data that would be awkward to list in-article
2014-12-13 21:08:28	@Espyo	and the list of locations... well, it fits that description, but it's also too awkward to almost not fit
2014-12-13 21:08:39	@PikFan	infoboxes themselves are confusing
2014-12-13 21:08:48	@PikFan	but their purpose isn't that defined either
2014-12-13 21:09:26	@PikFan	also, it's funny that you were thinking of infoboxes, because I was too
2014-12-13 21:09:53	@Espyo	huh? we've always been talking about infoboxes
2014-12-13 21:09:53	@PikFan	with all the canon enemies on Fanon, it might make sense to have a canon infobox
2014-12-13 21:10:07	@PikFan	keyword: might
2014-12-13 21:10:25	@Espyo	my take on that
2014-12-13 21:10:31	@Espyo	is that enemies that are canon ALSO appear in fanon games
2014-12-13 21:10:36	@Espyo	so it might not make much sense to do so
2014-12-13 21:10:48	@Espyo	the enemies as they are in the fanon games are FANON content
2014-12-13 21:10:58	@Espyo	it's just that they also appear in canon games
2014-12-13 21:11:07	@Espyo	but because Fanon shouldn't bother with canon content...
2014-12-13 21:11:51	@PikFan	hm
2014-12-13 21:11:55	@PikFan	[[f:Red Bulborb]]
2014-12-13 21:11:56	Testyo	"Red_Bulborb" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Red_Bulborb
2014-12-13 21:12:15	@PikFan	that layout eliminates the infobox problem
2014-12-13 21:13:09	@Espyo	hm, you're suggesting having a single template per page?
2014-12-13 21:13:12	@Espyo	instead of one per section?
2014-12-13 21:13:49	@PikFan	I don't follow
2014-12-13 21:14:09	@Espyo	how do you envision an enemy infobox to be on a fanon article
2014-12-13 21:14:14	@Espyo	just one, at the top of the article
2014-12-13 21:14:20	@Espyo	or one on top of each game section?
2014-12-13 21:14:30	@PikFan	the former would be preferable, but...
2014-12-13 21:14:38	@PikFan	the latter would make more sense
2014-12-13 21:14:55	@PikFan	maybe... we can combine them
2014-12-13 21:15:09	@PikFan	like {{infobox mission}}
2014-12-13 21:15:10	Testyo	"infobox_mission" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:infobox_mission
2014-12-13 21:15:35	@Espyo	now I'm not following
2014-12-13 21:16:02	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_mission&oldid=141477
2014-12-13 21:16:12	@PikFan	...wait
2014-12-13 21:16:13	@PikFan	uh
2014-12-13 21:16:15	@PikFan	hmm
2014-12-13 21:16:22	@PikFan	could it work...?
2014-12-13 21:17:07	@PikFan	anyway, what I was thinking is that we would have the info divided up by game
2014-12-13 21:17:17	@PikFan	then make it toggleable 
2014-12-13 21:17:36	@PikFan	so that you show one's game information at a time
2014-12-13 21:17:54	@PikFan	then if you wanted to see another game's info, you click on that game's button
2014-12-13 21:18:36	@PikFan	but I'm not even sure if that's possible
2014-12-13 21:18:50	@Espyo	...
2014-12-13 21:18:56	@Espyo	you expect there to be 20 buttons?
2014-12-13 21:19:46	@PikFan	sadly, yes
2014-12-13 21:19:56	@Espyo	I'd hate to be on your shoes
2014-12-13 21:20:00	@Espyo	there's no good way to do this
2014-12-13 21:20:14	@Espyo	I think that right now, you should focus on having ANYTHING, as long as it's consistent
2014-12-13 21:20:21	@Espyo	because right now it's hard to envision anything when it's anarchy
2014-12-13 21:20:23	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2014-12-13 21:20:24	@PikFan	though they wouldn't be buttons
2014-12-13 21:20:32	@PikFan	more like links
2014-12-13 21:20:52	@PikFan	just normal text, not wrapped around in anything
2014-12-13 21:24:38	@PikFan	there should be a book called "Fanon Wikis for Dummies"
2014-12-13 21:24:58	@PikFan	everything is so twisted
2014-12-13 21:25:02	@PikFan	nothing makes sense
2014-12-13 21:25:08	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaaaaaah
2014-12-13 21:25:13	@PikFan	so /frustrated/

2014-12-13 21:50:35	@Espyo	 23 now
2014-12-13 21:50:41	@PikFan	if anything you're a young coot
2014-12-13 21:50:45	@Espyo	obviously I have dementia, so yeah, I'm an old coot
2014-12-13 21:51:27	@PikFan	(...I'm dumb, I contradicted my own statement :| )
2014-12-13 21:51:52	@PikFan	anyway, reworking my plot a little bit
2014-12-13 21:52:07	@PikFan	decided having 4 captains straight away wasn't good
2014-12-13 21:52:17	@PikFan	so it starts out with just Olimar and Louie
2014-12-13 21:52:42	@PikFan	the two other captains come along later
2014-12-13 21:52:58	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Pyroclasmic Slooch by Espyo (+1 m /* Trivia */ Well strap my nose hairs and call me Diddums.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pyroclasmic_Slooch&curid=9307&diff=143166&oldid=143165
2014-12-13 21:53:53	@Espyo	oh, I never said
2014-12-13 21:53:56	@Espyo	I had an idea recently
2014-12-13 21:54:06	@Espyo	the Pikmin fangame engine is meant to allow Pikmin fangames
2014-12-13 21:54:13	@Espyo	so it has to be flexible
2014-12-13 21:54:17	@Espyo	and pretty complex
2014-12-13 21:54:26	@Espyo	and it's also a bit... uh, fancy
2014-12-13 21:54:35	@Espyo	like, I could've used maps like old-school RPGs
2014-12-13 21:54:37	Yoshi2	sounds good
2014-12-13 21:54:38	@Espyo	just a grid of blocks
2014-12-13 21:54:42	@Espyo	that would make it a lot easier
2014-12-13 21:54:56	@Espyo	but I chose to make the maps use lines and vertices instead for maximum freedom
2014-12-13 21:54:58	@Espyo	but here's the thing
2014-12-13 21:55:09	@Espyo	for one thing, we all know that I might not complete it, and even if I do, it'll take me some years
2014-12-13 21:55:21	@Espyo	and all of this complexity takes a bit of a toll on some machines
2014-12-13 21:55:35	@Espyo	APPARENTLY, it doesn't, because it can run WAY too well on mid-age machines
2014-12-13 21:55:45	@Espyo	so I'm guessing old machines would be able to run it at at least 20fps
2014-12-13 21:55:48	@Espyo	but here's the thing...
2014-12-13 21:55:57	@Espyo	sometimes, I just wanted to be able to play Pikmin on the subway or something
2014-12-13 21:56:08	@Espyo	I just want that high you get when you send Pikmin to multitask
2014-12-13 21:56:18	@Espyo	a screen full of Pikmin doing tasks, scratching your multitasking itch
2014-12-13 21:56:34	@Espyo	as well as puzzle-solving and strategizing
2014-12-13 21:56:39	@Espyo	and... that probably wouldn't work with the engine
2014-12-13 21:56:41	@Espyo	so I got an idea
2014-12-13 21:56:49	@Espyo	I should do a super-simple Pikmin fangame
2014-12-13 21:56:56	@Espyo	simple maps, simple mechanics, simple physics
2014-12-13 21:57:02	@Espyo	but leave the core gameplay ideas intact
2014-12-13 21:57:16	@PikFan	you already told us you'd do a super simple engine
2014-12-13 21:57:16	@Espyo	it should be a lot easier to make it work anywhere, including portable devices
2014-12-13 21:57:22	@Espyo	and I should get it ready in just a few months
2014-12-13 21:57:23	@Espyo	oh, did I?
2014-12-13 21:57:25	@Espyo	can't even remember
2014-12-13 21:57:32	@PikFan	but you never told us the reasoning
2014-12-13 21:57:44	@Espyo	wish J was here, he could give me a bit of feedback over my choice of environment
2014-12-13 21:57:52	@Espyo	though I'm sure you can give your input too, Yoshi2
2014-12-13 21:57:59	@Espyo	I was thinking HTML5 canvas + Javascript
2014-12-13 21:58:34	@Espyo	problem: potential performance problems
2014-12-13 21:58:48	@Espyo	Javascript isn't THAT great to make games
2014-12-13 21:58:55	@Espyo	and all in all, I still have to keep track of 100+ entities
2014-12-13 21:59:07	@Espyo	hmm, does Javascript allow multi-touch?
2014-12-13 21:59:09	@Espyo	if not, I can forget the idea
2014-12-13 21:59:17	@Espyo	I could never make a Pikmin game with single-touch controls
2014-12-13 22:00:18	Yoshi2	indeed, single-touch controls on a touch device would be rather awkward, to say the least
2014-12-13 22:01:25	Yoshi2	wouldn't javascript supporting multi-touch depend on whatever library is used to check if the user has touched a spot on the screen?
2014-12-13 22:01:46	@Espyo	probably
2014-12-13 22:02:22	@Espyo	google apparently says it's possible
2014-12-13 22:02:59	Yoshi2	I haven't done game development myself yet, so I can't say much about what kind of environment you might want to use

2014-12-13 22:09:20	@Espyo	yup, multitouch works
2014-12-13 22:10:59	@Espyo	still the performance problem
2014-12-13 22:11:11	@Espyo	I mean, my internship at college was at a company where I made JS games and...
2014-12-13 22:11:17	@Espyo	IIRC, I had trouble keeping them at 20fps

2014-12-13 22:11:31	Testyo	and I couldn't call back Pikmin that were lots of sounds from Pikmin hitting water, so maybe it hit the concurrent sound limit

2014-12-14 13:01:02	Yoshi2	hey Espyo 
2014-12-14 13:04:31	@Espyo	hi
2014-12-14 13:04:35	@Espyo	welp, it was inevitable
2014-12-14 13:04:42	@Espyo	people got their skype updated
2014-12-14 13:04:49	@Espyo	mine stayed unupdated for like two weeks
2014-12-14 13:04:51	@Espyo	then today...
2014-12-14 13:04:54	@Espyo	boom, update
2014-12-14 13:04:59	@Espyo	people said it sucks, and...
2014-12-14 13:05:18	@Espyo	well, the interface is like the new modern "oversimplistic" theme that EVERYTHING uses
2014-12-14 13:05:26	@Espyo	so that's already a great sign
2014-12-14 13:05:31	Yoshi2	oh yes
2014-12-14 13:05:36	@Espyo	and apparently, ever since the update, load of people had their skype break
2014-12-14 13:06:00	@Espyo	if it weren't for group calls and for the Pikipedia skype group, I'd have gotten rid of it years ago
2014-12-14 13:06:16	@Espyo	besides the update, it has some persistent bugs that the devs don't bother to fix
2014-12-14 13:06:28	@Espyo	one of them is even on my screen right now
2014-12-14 13:06:33	@Espyo	one of my friends is marked as away
2014-12-14 13:06:35	Yoshi2	I really wonder why somebody thought that slapping a phone interface on freaking computer program was a good idea
2014-12-14 13:06:36	@Espyo	that means he's offline
2014-12-14 13:06:43	@Espyo	if he enters online, he gets marked as offline
2014-12-14 13:06:59	@Espyo	microsoft INSISTS that's the way to go
2014-12-14 13:07:08	@Espyo	computers aren't cell phones, but let's pretend anyway!
2014-12-14 13:07:23	@Espyo	*phones
2014-12-14 13:07:40	@Espyo	plus, besides the phone-oriented interface
2014-12-14 13:07:45	@Espyo	the oversimplistic thing is disgusting
2014-12-14 13:07:50	@Espyo	one thing is being minimalistic
2014-12-14 13:08:01	Yoshi2	simple design can look good
2014-12-14 13:08:02	@Espyo	sure, the less the human brain has to process of the image, the easier it is to find what they want
2014-12-14 13:08:21	@Espyo	but the "modern" designs?
2014-12-14 13:08:32	@Espyo	they aren't simple, they're basic shapes made in 3 seconds
2014-12-14 13:08:38	@Espyo	they're solid colors
2014-12-14 13:08:40	@Espyo	it hurts my eyes
2014-12-14 13:08:46	@Espyo	reminds me of me in pre-school
2014-12-14 13:08:46	@Espyo	eesh
2014-12-14 13:08:55	@Espyo	...
2014-12-14 13:09:05	@Espyo	the... mouse wheel scrolls one tenth of the content it used to
2014-12-14 13:09:16	@Espyo	this BETTER be some silly glitch because it's the first time using the new update
2014-12-14 13:11:34	Yoshi2	I can't even get myself to install skype with a clean conscience
2014-12-14 13:13:32	Yoshi2	I've been looking around on the hcs forum again, and I think that would be a nice place to talk about the bms project
2014-12-14 13:13:56	Yoshi2	"Hey guys, I've done some work on BMS and my source code doesn't look like I hacked it together in 10 minutes!"
2014-12-14 13:14:15	@Espyo	hehehe
2014-12-14 13:15:51	Yoshi2	I found an older BMS project written in php
2014-12-14 13:15:57	Yoshi2	php, of all the things
2014-12-14 13:16:32	@Espyo	whaaa
2014-12-14 13:16:41	@Espyo	oh wait, I know the one
2014-12-14 13:16:47	@Espyo	I was actually able to run it, somehow
2014-12-14 13:18:35	Yoshi2	I also found this: http://bms.max-ton.net/files/bms.txt
2014-12-14 13:20:11	Yoshi2	besides the information being difficult to read, I think the author assumes that BMS files have a header
2014-12-14 13:21:08	@Espyo	hmm
2014-12-14 13:22:44	Yoshi2	I think arookas was very spot-on with saying that they are dynamically interpreted

2014-12-14 18:40:25	@PikFan	so that some caves don't have anything to do with the story at all, other than 100% completion
2014-12-14 18:40:40	@PikFan	instead of being required to explore every single cave
2014-12-14 18:41:22	@PikFan	kinda like how in P3, once you rescue a certain someone twice, you can go straight to the final boss
2014-12-14 18:41:48	@PikFan	but if you want 100% completion, you go back to the other areas
2014-12-14 18:42:09	@PikFan	speaking of P3, I'm going to be including a lot of obstacles from P3
2014-12-14 18:42:28	@PikFan	except for ones that need Rocks/Wingeds
2014-12-14 18:43:20	@Espyo	hm, yeah

2014-12-14 19:52:47	@PikFan	I have a question
2014-12-14 19:53:09	@PikFan	for my game, should all Pikmin types have Onions when they're found, like P3?
2014-12-14 19:53:25	@PikFan	or just have Candypop Buds to start out with, like P2?
2014-12-14 19:54:57	Yoshi2	what do you mean with candypop buds?
2014-12-14 19:55:27	@Espyo	hmmmmmm
2014-12-14 19:55:31	@PikFan	in P2, the only way you can get more Purple and White Pikmin is by candypops
2014-12-14 19:55:32	@Espyo	your choice, really
2014-12-14 19:56:00	@PikFan	hm
2014-12-14 19:56:33	@PikFan	well, I guess I can just have Onions for the aboveground Pikmin
2014-12-14 19:56:41	Yoshi2	ah, you mean these weird flowers in which you can throw pikmin to convert them into different types
2014-12-14 19:57:09	@PikFan	then for underground species—yes—they have a dormant Onion you have to carry back to the research pod
2014-12-14 19:57:24	@PikFan	which activates when you return to the surface
2014-12-14 19:57:51	@PikFan	but in Hard mode, none of the new Pikmin types have Onions
2014-12-14 19:58:03	@PikFan	hmm, I like that
2014-12-14 19:58:19	@PikFan	also making a table

2014-12-14 20:06:26	@PikFan	something about that isn't right
2014-12-14 20:07:53	Yoshi2	quite well written, but it almost feels like a piece of story from a book
2014-12-14 20:08:04	@PikFan	I agree
2014-12-14 20:08:35	@Espyo	lol

2014-12-17 11:31:36	Mariostar	Hi.
2014-12-17 11:31:56	Yoshi2	hey Mariostar 
2014-12-17 11:33:22	Mariostar	Hey.
2014-12-17 11:33:47	Yoshi2	Hi
2014-12-17 11:34:29	Mariostar	l'm thinking about using the Golden hammers inSmash bros. to complete challenges.
2014-12-17 11:34:51	Yoshi2	on the 3DS or on the Wii U?
2014-12-17 11:35:03	Mariostar	Wii U.
2014-12-17 11:35:20	Yoshi2	I'd use it as a last resort
2014-12-17 11:36:00	Yoshi2	often there are tips for how to complete specific challenges
2014-12-17 11:36:07	Mariostar	I'm more about the reword.
2014-12-17 11:36:19	Mariostar	I found that list with all tips.
2014-12-17 11:36:44	Mariostar	http://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_challenges_(SSB4-Wii_U)
2014-12-17 11:37:44	Yoshi2	are there any good rewards?
2014-12-17 11:39:14	Mariostar	I'm researching the prize in the top left and the CDs
2014-12-17 11:40:26	Yoshi2	hm, the CDs are worth getting indeed
2014-12-17 11:40:47	Yoshi2	I am not sure if the 3DS version has any CDs, I think not
2014-12-17 11:42:47	Mariostar	The music in the Wii U is amazing.
2014-12-17 11:43:04	Mariostar	However,l mostly go for songs in games l have or remixes.
2014-12-17 11:43:39	Mariostar	Such as "tough guy alert" (Bowser's inside story boss theme)
2014-12-17 11:44:30	Yoshi2	remixes are cool
2014-12-17 11:44:48	Mariostar	Hell yeah.
2014-12-17 11:44:58	Yoshi2	I like the remix of Gerudo's Valley on the 3DS
2014-12-17 11:45:19	Mariostar	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB3D5WJX5lQ
2014-12-17 11:45:41	Mariostar	Oh,look at that,l searched for it and you said it. :P
2014-12-17 11:46:21	Mariostar	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTGLvNutxws Listen to this.
2014-12-17 11:49:12	Mariostar	Another song has been found in the sound files,said to play on the Miiverse stage.
2014-12-17 11:51:36	Yoshi2	somebody is already dissecting the game files?
2014-12-17 11:52:11	Mariostar	Yes.
2014-12-17 11:52:33	Mariostar	They have found a Palutaina's guidence and the Miiverse stage songs.
2014-12-17 11:52:45	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-12-17 11:53:02	Yoshi2	I am looking forward to seeing what is hidden in the various Wii U games
2014-12-17 11:53:17	Yoshi2	unused or old content
2014-12-17 11:53:31	Mariostar	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crvqM890_7U Take a listen,what do you think? Place holder?
2014-12-17 11:55:16	Mariostar	l would say it was a test for the guidence considering all (but three) fighters are from a alternative dimension (to Kid icarus) 
2014-12-17 11:57:11	Mariostar	l'm going to play Smash now,bye.

2014-12-17 12:04:45	Mariostar	Darn....
2014-12-17 12:05:19	Yoshi2	wb
2014-12-17 12:05:25	Mariostar	Thank you.
2014-12-17 12:05:33	Mariostar	l messed up....
2014-12-17 12:05:47	Yoshi2	what is particulary odd about that guidance video? I haven't played SSB4 WiiU yet
2014-12-17 12:06:10	Yoshi2	so I'm not sure if this conversation between characters from Kid Icarus Uprising is supposed to happen
2014-12-17 12:06:23	Mariostar	It's not in the final game.
2014-12-17 12:07:04	Yoshi2	no such conversation actually appears in the final game?
2014-12-17 12:07:41	Mariostar	No,unless it does when Mewtwo is added.
2014-12-17 12:07:52	Mariostar	Also https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYQHAAABAACNUKE2YMO6JA so close.
2014-12-17 12:08:15	Yoshi2	I see
2014-12-17 12:09:57	Yoshi2	I'll take a closer look at the video when I'm home, can't really do it right now
2014-12-17 12:10:09	Yoshi2	I wonder if the conversation includes text from KI:Uprising
2014-12-17 12:13:12	Mariostar	Possibly.
2014-12-17 12:14:45	Yoshi2	I'll try to pay attention to it as I have played KI:U
2014-12-17 12:14:59	Mariostar	Alright.
2014-12-17 12:15:48	Yoshi2	wouldn't be too far fetched because SSB4 seems to have a few things in common with KI:U
2014-12-17 12:16:01	Mariostar	Well,Sakurai.
2014-12-17 12:16:05	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-12-17 12:16:11	Mariostar	Exactly.
2014-12-17 12:17:55	Mariostar	Did pit have the same voice actor in brawl and KIU?
2014-12-17 12:18:43	Yoshi2	Pit doesn't speak a lot in Brawl, does he?
2014-12-17 12:19:35	Mariostar	His taunts and victory animations.
2014-12-17 12:19:41	Yoshi2	I see
2014-12-17 12:20:05	Yoshi2	I'd have to take a look at his taunts
2014-12-17 12:21:43	Yoshi2	in KI:U, Pit does talk a lot
2014-12-17 12:22:15	Mariostar	1;25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTD6FcLDjHc
2014-12-17 12:22:17	Yoshi2	I'd be suprised if they had the same voice actor speak the text in the English version as in Brawl
2014-12-17 12:22:50	Mariostar	Now l look again,i'd say not.
2014-12-17 12:26:52	Yoshi2	I'll be going now, see you later
2014-12-17 12:27:18	Mariostar	Bye.

2014-12-17 18:58:33	Mariostar	Also,what...the...fuck https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYQHAAABAACXVHhg7ruCVQ
2014-12-17 18:59:44	Yoshi2	Mariostar: really hard to tell
2014-12-17 19:00:14	@Espyo	heh, the usual
2014-12-17 19:00:38	Mariostar	l would have gone for some Wii shop points,but l seem to have lost 200
2014-12-17 19:01:44	Yoshi2	is there anything that could be bought with 100 Wii shop points?
2014-12-17 19:02:08	Mariostar	They had the Kirby:triple deluxe soundtrack,but that's gone,also no.
2014-12-17 19:02:19	Yoshi2	I have quite a few unused star points, I don't even bother to register them
2014-12-17 19:02:41	Mariostar	What region?
2014-12-17 19:03:13	Yoshi2	Germany
2014-12-17 19:03:27	Mariostar	Also,my 3DS broke before Smash3DS,so l scammed someone on Miiverse to get his code for Mewtwo....
2014-12-17 19:04:16	Mariostar	lt worked.
2014-12-17 19:05:04	Mariostar	Look at this: "Promotion participants who qualify between 23:00 (UK time) on January 20th and 22:59 (UK time) on March 31st 2015 will be able to add the powerful character Mewtwo."
2014-12-17 19:05:05	Testyo	31 st = 196.859 kg / 434 lb / 6944 oz
2014-12-17 19:05:35	Mariostar	Sure,real powerful.
2014-12-17 19:05:57	Yoshi2	not exactly something I'd be proud of
2014-12-17 19:06:34	Mariostar	I'll just use him online for trolling.
2014-12-17 19:06:49	Mariostar	Mostly "LOL I HAZ MEW2 AND U DONT"
2014-12-17 19:07:04	@Espyo	...
2014-12-17 19:07:13	Mariostar	But who has the Wii U version,plays online and bot have the 3DS version?
2014-12-17 19:07:20	Mariostar	Who had a 3DS.
2014-12-17 19:08:42	Mariostar	l wonder how Mewtwo online will work.
2014-12-17 19:08:44	Yoshi2	saving up the star point codes does seem to pay off
2014-12-17 19:09:08	Mariostar	It takes so long though.
2014-12-17 19:09:16	Yoshi2	eh
2014-12-17 19:09:16	Mariostar	But hey,it's free.
2014-12-17 19:09:31	Yoshi2	I mean such specials where you can get a free game if you register specific products
2014-12-17 19:09:37	Mariostar	And l orderd a ball game.
2014-12-17 19:10:12	Mariostar	Someone l know is getting a 2DS,so l can get that code.
2014-12-17 19:10:26	Mariostar	Kirby.
2014-12-17 19:10:56	Yoshi2	I registered the code from my 3DS which I bought two years ago
2014-12-17 19:11:00	@Espyo	so let me get this straight
2014-12-17 19:11:07	@Espyo	you scammed somebody on Miiverse
2014-12-17 19:11:09	Yoshi2	I just need to register SSB4 3DS to get the free game
2014-12-17 19:11:19	@Espyo	into giving you their SSB43DS code
2014-12-17 19:11:24	@Espyo	for a free Mewtwo
2014-12-17 19:12:02	Mariostar	Yes.
2014-12-17 19:12:15	Mariostar	Well,l guess.
2014-12-17 19:12:45	@Espyo	and you find that okay
2014-12-17 19:13:23	Mariostar	I'll give them Mewtwo.
2014-12-17 19:13:32	Mariostar	Part of the deal.
2014-12-17 19:14:20	@Espyo	you can't just "give them Mewtwo"
2014-12-17 19:14:42	Mariostar	l get two codes.
2014-12-17 19:16:24	Mariostar	Now i'm going to watch Egoraptor's video for the 35th time.
2014-12-17 19:16:25	@Espyo	how do you get two codes
2014-12-17 19:16:37	Mariostar	One for 3DS,one for Wii U.
2014-12-17 19:16:51	@Espyo	where did you read that that's how it works?
2014-12-17 19:17:38	Mariostar	Second paragraph. https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Campaigns/Super-Smash-Bros-Club-Nintendo-Promotion/Super-Smash-Bros-Club-Nintendo-Promotion-937174.html
2014-12-17 19:18:07	Mariostar	Of the second section.
2014-12-17 19:18:42	Mariostar	Anyway,brb.

2014-12-17 19:19:28	@Espyo	but he's still a bit of a mong for scamming the person to begin with
2014-12-17 19:25:31	Yoshi2	well, I should probably register my SSB code so that I can get that free 3DS game before time expires

2014-12-17 19:50:30	Yoshi2	sadly, no
2014-12-17 19:50:35	Mariostar	What?
2014-12-17 19:50:48	Yoshi2	but I already have both Link Between Worlds and Fire Emblem
2014-12-17 19:51:03	@Espyo	oh
2014-12-17 19:51:19	Yoshi2	and Fire Emblem Awakening is pretty damn good if you are into turn based strategy
2014-12-17 19:52:23	Yoshi2	I'm not into Monster Hunter, so the Kirby game is pretty much the only one that seems particulary interesting
2014-12-17 19:52:44	Mariostar	That's what i'm getting from the promotion.
2014-12-17 19:53:44	@Espyo	just don't get the Yoshi game
2014-12-17 19:53:49	@Espyo	NOBODY I know recommends it
2014-12-17 19:54:15	Yoshi2	oh yes
2014-12-17 19:54:23	Yoshi2	I've heard that it is rather mediocre
2014-12-17 19:54:36	Yoshi2	haven't bothered to find out why it is supposed to be mediocre though
2014-12-17 19:54:56	Mariostar	Probley different to the SNES.
2014-12-17 19:55:54	Mariostar	Very different.
2014-12-17 19:56:22	@Espyo	they say it's very different
2014-12-17 19:56:25	@Espyo	like, the SNES one was great
2014-12-17 19:56:28	@Espyo	and then this one comes
2014-12-17 19:56:31	@Espyo	tries to be similar
2014-12-17 19:56:33	@Espyo	and just fails everywhere
2014-12-17 19:56:39	@Espyo	it ruins the canon, it makes the gameplay dull
2014-12-17 19:56:46	@Espyo	and it makes you want to gouge your ears out with the music
2014-12-17 19:57:01	Mariostar	The music is amazing.
2014-12-17 20:01:35	Yoshi2	alright, I should be set now, just need to connect my 3DS to the internet and get the game
2014-12-17 20:02:01	Yoshi2	I wonder if I can set up tethering on this notebook
2014-12-17 20:02:25	Mariostar	Yoshi,get the shovel knight theme while it's free.
2014-12-17 20:02:45	Yoshi2	where?
2014-12-17 20:03:00	Mariostar	3DS theme store.
2014-12-17 20:03:17	Mariostar	If you don't have the update,it won't be there.
2014-12-17 20:03:26	Yoshi2	I see
2014-12-17 20:05:32	Mariostar	Also,you will need to update your 3DS to get to the eshop.
2014-12-17 20:06:42	Mariostar	l'm looking for a 3DS replacment.

2014-12-18 17:00:48	Yoshi2	I don't remember anymore, but it is likely not particulary long
2014-12-18 17:00:54	Yoshi2	10 hours at most
2014-12-18 17:01:11	Yoshi2	the game's strength lies in its replay value
2014-12-18 17:01:50	Mariostar	How much side content (aside multiplayer) is there?
2014-12-18 17:06:53	Yoshi2	you can collect different types of weapons, you can create new weapons by combining old weapons, you can replay levels on a higher difficulty for better bonuses
2014-12-18 17:08:14	Yoshi2	and levels often have bits of content locked away behind different difficulty levels, like treasures and bosses
2014-12-18 17:08:21	Mariostar	Any other gameplay modes?
2014-12-18 17:09:07	Mariostar	The online multiplayer is a huge seelling point to me,KIU is amazing
2014-12-18 17:09:07	Yoshi2	besides the main game and the multiplayer, I don't think there are any gameplay modes
2014-12-18 17:09:30	Yoshi2	and I haven't been able to play the multiplayer yet, so I can't say how it is

2014-12-18 19:33:40	Yoshi2	let's see if I can get my 3DS updated this time
2014-12-18 19:34:42	@Espyo	good luck
2014-12-18 19:35:06	Yoshi2	the 3DS does not support connecting to a wlan router with a name and a password, so I can't do this at the university
2014-12-18 19:35:18	Yoshi2	(I tried)
2014-12-18 19:38:06	Yoshi2	alternatively, I could get my old router up and running 
2014-12-18 19:38:14	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-12-18 19:38:21	Yoshi2	which would be a bit of work though, I'm not sure if it is still set up correctly
2014-12-18 19:39:37	Yoshi2	hm, no luck
2014-12-18 19:50:04	Yoshi2	I've specified the DNS IP in the settings, maybe that does something
2014-12-18 19:50:20	Yoshi2	... so far this looks good, doesn't break after 5 seconds

2014-12-18 19:53:14	Yoshi2	well, there we go, it is doing actual progress
2014-12-18 19:54:14	Yoshi2	if any of you ever end up in a situation where you have a noteboot connected through lan but no wlan router, and you want to go online with a 3DS, this is how you do it
2014-12-18 20:05:45	@Espyo	J, are you there?
2014-12-18 20:05:56	@Espyo	you can vote too, Yoshi2
2014-12-18 20:06:08	@Espyo	[[Pikipedia:Policy/proposals]]
2014-12-18 20:06:08	Testyo	"Pikipedia:Policy/proposals" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikipedia:Policy/proposals
2014-12-18 20:29:17	Yoshi2	I agree with the points about proper nouns, objects, important objects and simple words
2014-12-18 20:29:32	Yoshi2	names of species are a bit more tricky
2014-12-18 20:30:35	@Espyo	same
2014-12-18 20:30:42	Yoshi2	I'd love to write "blue Pikmin", "red Pikmin", but the Pikmin are different enough, with each type being quite important, that their names could be written in titel case
2014-12-18 20:31:06	@Espyo	I'm fine either way, about the Pikmin
2014-12-18 20:31:19	@Espyo	(although keeping it title case would be the laziest way)
2014-12-18 20:31:22	@Espyo	but the enemy names...
2014-12-18 20:31:44	@Espyo	I just can't imagine calling it like "armored mawdad"
2014-12-18 20:31:55	@Espyo	it has to be "Armored Mawdad", otherwise it just feels very wrong, everywhere
2014-12-18 20:32:06	Yoshi2	your bias is showing
2014-12-18 20:33:37	Yoshi2	for me, seeing "Armored Mawdad" feels rather wrong, but I'm not a biologist
2014-12-18 20:34:31	Yoshi2	though you mentioned that species names are commonly written in lower case
2014-12-18 20:36:01	@Espyo	heh, not so much bias
2014-12-18 20:36:04	@Espyo	well, not so much PERSONAL bias
2014-12-18 20:36:10	Yoshi2	I'd say that lower case species names are technically more correct
2014-12-18 20:36:16	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure anybody would dislike enemy names in lowercase
2014-12-18 20:36:18	@Espyo	well, except you :|
2014-12-18 20:36:30	Yoshi2	it's not an Armored Mawdawd, it is a mawdawd that is armored
2014-12-18 20:36:36	Yoshi2	:|
2014-12-18 20:36:39	@Espyo	I think it's because
2014-12-18 20:36:47	@Espyo	in any other game, the enemy names are in title case
2014-12-18 20:36:57	@Espyo	that's why it feels wrong seeing it in lower
2014-12-18 20:37:41	Yoshi2	that seems probable
2014-12-18 20:38:04	Yoshi2	I haven't paid too much attention to how the names are spelled in Pikmin 2, and I have played Pikmin 3 completely in German
2014-12-18 20:39:42	@Espyo	hmm
2014-12-18 20:53:21	Yoshi2	alright, I've finally managed to install the Kirby game

2014-12-21 00:41:50	@PikFan	so yesterday I came up with a system for obstacles
2014-12-21 00:42:12	@PikFan	in the canon games, 'obstacle' is loosely defined
2014-12-21 00:42:45	@PikFan	for my fan game, there's a more concrete definition
2014-12-21 00:43:27	@PikFan	there are two main types of obstacles: blocking and integrated
2014-12-21 00:44:02	@PikFan	blocking obstacles directly impede the player's progress, like gates
2014-12-21 00:44:38	@PikFan	integrated obstacles are used to get to otherwise inaccessible places, like scales

2014-12-22 13:47:17	Mariostar	Espyo,my amiibo came on a sunday night....
2014-12-22 13:47:28	@Espyo	weird
2014-12-22 13:47:46	Mariostar	I know,it's a odd time for amazon to deliver it...
2014-12-22 13:48:24	Mariostar	I called him Linic in the system settings,and Juice in Smash bros,but that changed it to Juice in the system settings.
2014-12-22 13:49:11	Mariostar	l also figured out how to post masterpieces to Miiverse.
2014-12-22 13:50:07	@Espyo	just use the home button, right?
2014-12-22 13:50:09	Mariostar	This chat has weird advertisements.
2014-12-22 13:50:15	@Espyo	no ads for me
2014-12-22 13:50:16	Mariostar	No,it won't let you.
2014-12-22 13:50:25	@Espyo	then how do you do it?
2014-12-22 13:50:54	Mariostar	Press ZL+ZR (Classic controller,pro controller,gamepad) then open the Eshop,close it,then go to miiverse.
2014-12-22 13:52:36	Mariostar	I have also discoverd that the only CPUs that can beat my amiibo are from fire emblem.
2014-12-22 13:52:42	@Espyo	oh, nice
2014-12-22 13:52:58	@Espyo	weird, even Robin=
2014-12-22 13:53:00	@Espyo	*?
2014-12-22 13:53:11	Mariostar	Robin does the best.
2014-12-22 13:53:36	Mariostar	I also think sudden death was directed by Michael Bay.
2014-12-22 13:53:55	Yoshi2	explosive sudden death
2014-12-22 13:55:18	Mariostar	Hi Yoshi.
2014-12-22 13:55:58	Mariostar	If l could add one thing to Super smash bros. for Wii U,it would be the feature to use amiibo online.
2014-12-22 13:56:42	Yoshi2	I think it isn't possible to use your Mii to play against random other players, is it?
2014-12-22 13:56:55	Mariostar	No.
2014-12-22 13:57:10	Mariostar	l think it should,ir just removes all equipment.
2014-12-22 13:58:45	Yoshi2	quite a shame, would've been fun to see a lot of mii characters inspired by famous people and history
2014-12-22 13:58:59	Mariostar	Like Hitler?
2014-12-22 14:00:22	Yoshi2	I suppose you can put it that way
2014-12-22 14:03:49	Mariostar	That would be the most common Nii.
2014-12-22 14:03:53	Mariostar	*Mii
2014-12-22 14:06:56	Mariostar	You know Nintendo have a Mii that looks like Hitler?
2014-12-22 14:09:03	Yoshi2	do they?
2014-12-22 14:14:06	Mariostar	Yes.
2014-12-22 14:18:50	Mariostar	I have seen it in two games.
2014-12-22 14:18:55	Mariostar	And this.

2014-12-22 15:58:04	masterdav	I found finally full versions of the Pikmin 3 soundtrack with variations like Pikmin 2
2014-12-22 15:59:14	@Espyo	oh?
2014-12-22 15:59:16	@Espyo	do tell!

2014-12-22 16:01:11	masterdav	I put one of them on Youtube
2014-12-22 16:05:43	@Espyo	ten minutes? woah
2014-12-22 16:05:55	@Espyo	where'd you get them from?
2014-12-22 16:05:57	@Espyo	an official OST?
2014-12-22 16:06:32	masterdav	It's ripped
2014-12-22 16:07:09	Yoshi2	recorded from the game in a quiet environment, or taken from the files?
2014-12-22 16:07:40	masterdav	taken from the files but I only found them on the Internet
2014-12-22 16:07:48	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-12-22 16:08:02	@Espyo	how can people have been able to mess with the files already?
2014-12-22 16:08:07	@Espyo	and the files are in a known format?
2014-12-22 16:08:12	@Espyo	that's just the weirdest
2014-12-22 16:08:12	Yoshi2	I expected the game to have a midi-like music format similar to Pikmin 1 and 2
2014-12-22 16:08:16	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2014-12-22 16:08:21	@Espyo	specially considering it's also an eShop title
2014-12-22 16:08:24	@Espyo	so it has to try to be small
2014-12-22 16:08:33	@Espyo	it can't afford to have non-midi
2014-12-22 16:08:40	@Espyo	I wish we could access the files...
2014-12-22 16:08:45	@Espyo	but that's pretty cool
2014-12-22 16:09:45	masterdav	Its on the .bfstm at first
2014-12-22 16:10:38	@Espyo	ah
2014-12-22 16:10:40	masterdav	and I used vgmstream to turn them to wav
2014-12-22 16:10:44	@Espyo	wow
2014-12-22 16:10:51	@Espyo	after all these years, they're still using that format
2014-12-22 16:10:58	@Espyo	pretty darn amazing
2014-12-22 16:11:20	@Espyo	are all of the song variations inside the same song?
2014-12-22 16:11:24	@Espyo	like on the youtube video you linked?
2014-12-22 16:11:53	masterdav	jep you need audacity to set the multichannels
2014-12-22 16:13:01	@Espyo	ah, I see
2014-12-22 16:13:41	masterdav	I upload the files on mediafire
2014-12-22 16:15:08	Yoshi2	I wonder if they got rid of the BMS format
2014-12-22 16:15:18	@Espyo	can't you link to the site you get them from instead?
2014-12-22 16:15:23	@Espyo	they probably did
2014-12-22 16:15:34	@Espyo	you know how they were already fussing about with the format during the GameCube era
2014-12-22 16:15:38	@Espyo	almost every game does the format differently
2014-12-22 16:15:43	masterdav	can I do to
2014-12-22 16:15:49	Yoshi2	theoretically, they have enough memory to keep entire music streams inside RAM
2014-12-22 16:16:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-22 16:21:44	masterdav	http://109.163.233.168/Wii%20U/Pikmin%203.rar
2014-12-22 16:22:07	Yoshi2	the music in the GC games does sound great, but it is synthesized and thus, imo, slightly inferior to music played in an orchestra
2014-12-22 16:22:42	masterdav	does it work?
2014-12-22 16:24:03	Yoshi2	seems so
2014-12-22 16:32:23	masterdav	I hope it can help some way, because nobody really put them on Youtube.
2014-12-22 16:43:14	Miles	Oh, I meant to link that, I found out about the music being ripped 2 months ago

2014-12-22 19:21:10	Yoshi2	I would be very interested in checking if that music rip contains some unused music
2014-12-22 19:22:49	@Espyo	it does
2014-12-22 19:22:59	@Espyo	a good end of day theme, as well as a bad one
2014-12-22 19:23:20	Yoshi2	you already checked it?
2014-12-22 19:23:27	Yoshi2	I feel like I missed out on a lot 
2014-12-22 19:24:08	@Espyo	gave it an overview
2014-12-22 19:24:13	@Espyo	I can't load the actual area music
2014-12-22 19:24:45	@Espyo	oh, I think it works if I write to disk
2014-12-22 19:28:10	Testyo	I still don't think that Pikmin PikFan
2014-12-22 19:28:36	Yoshi2	oh man, testyo
2014-12-22 19:28:37	Testyo	hmm, *yeah
2014-12-22 19:28:49	Yoshi2	you missed an opportunity to say that PikFan wasn't an actual Pikmin Fan
2014-12-22 19:29:56	@Espyo	hah, yeah
2014-12-22 19:37:54	Yoshi2	vgmstram does not support batch decoding, guess I'll have to write a script for it

2014-12-22 19:49:49	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-22 19:54:10	Yoshi2	this is odd, I'm unable to decode the files correctly
2014-12-22 19:58:27	Yoshi2	maybe I need a more recent version of the decoder
2014-12-22 20:02:50	Yoshi2	looks like I'll have to compile a more recent version of the commandline decoder myself
2014-12-22 20:03:39	@Espyo	you mean in_vgmstream?
2014-12-22 20:04:19	Yoshi2	in_vgmstream is just the dll, is it not?
2014-12-22 20:04:49	Yoshi2	I'm not able to use that directly unless I use an additional tool
2014-12-22 20:06:09	Yoshi2	there is also a CLI decoder called test, but the compiled one available on sourceforge seems to be at least 300 revisions behind
2014-12-22 20:11:05	Yoshi2	hmmm, nevermind
2014-12-22 20:15:47	Yoshi2	hcs64.com/files/vgmstream each revision always contains the dll and the CLI tool
2014-12-22 20:15:54	Yoshi2	somehow I missed it, and now it works

2014-12-23 23:53:57	@PikFan	so I've been coming up with ideas for new obstacles
2014-12-23 23:54:15	@PikFan	one of them is a gate that requires Purple Pikmin
2014-12-23 23:54:46	@PikFan	it works similarly to bamboo gates:
2014-12-23 23:55:02	@PikFan	there is a pressure plate nearby, that when pressed down, will open the gate
2014-12-23 23:55:09	@PikFan	it requires the weight of 100 Pikmin
2014-12-23 23:55:31	@PikFan	of course, having 100 Pikmin on it is unfeasible
2014-12-23 23:55:40	@PikFan	so instead you use 10 Purple Pikmin
2014-12-23 23:56:38	@PikFan	sinkholes are obstacles as well, but are hazardous
2014-12-23 23:57:05	@PikFan	any Pikmin caught in the sinkhole, if left unchecked, will be swallowed by the sand
2014-12-23 23:57:39	@PikFan	if you throw Tan Pikmin into it, they will "destroy" the sinkhole, which will spew up sand and fill up the hole
2014-12-23 23:57:56	@PikFan	without Tan Pikmin it is impassible
2014-12-24 00:00:56	@Espyo	oh, makes sense
2014-12-24 00:01:16	@PikFan	should there be other... uh
2014-12-24 00:01:22	@PikFan	what's the word?
2014-12-24 00:01:26	@Espyo	obstacles?
2014-12-24 00:01:28	@PikFan	variable, I guess
2014-12-24 00:01:51	@PikFan	but yeah, should there be other variable obstacles?
2014-12-24 00:02:56	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2014-12-24 00:02:57	@Espyo	I guess not
2014-12-24 00:03:25	@PikFan	Winged Pikmin don't appear in P3, so the pressure plate gate would be the only variable obstacle
2014-12-24 00:03:40	@PikFan	rather, variable /gate/
2014-12-24 00:05:02	@Espyo	in P3?
2014-12-24 00:05:19	@PikFan	no, my game
2014-12-24 00:05:24	@PikFan	...wait what
2014-12-24 00:05:31	@Espyo	you said P3
2014-12-24 00:05:32	@PikFan	dammit
2014-12-24 00:05:48	@PikFan	*Winged Pikmin don't appear in my game, so the pressure plate gate would be the only variable obstacle
2014-12-24 00:06:26	@Espyo	hehe
2014-12-24 00:06:28	@Espyo	yeah
2014-12-24 00:07:12	UltraMario	they are in pikmin 3
2014-12-24 00:07:20	UltraMario	huh
2014-12-24 00:07:25	@PikFan	right, I know, but I typo'd
2014-12-24 00:07:55	@PikFan	hmm, I need more obstacles
2014-12-24 00:08:16	UltraMario	hey, I have a question
2014-12-24 00:08:29	@PikFan	my game will have all canon obstacles (except those requiring Winged/Rocks) plus new ones
2014-12-24 00:08:32	@PikFan	yeah?
2014-12-24 00:08:42	UltraMario	how much of crossover games that have olimar in it does the wiki cover
2014-12-24 00:09:01	UltraMario	like to what extent of coverage
2014-12-24 00:09:14	@PikFan	you're better off asking Espyo
2014-12-24 00:09:25	UltraMario	Okay... ESPYO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2014-12-24 00:14:03	UltraMario	oh, it should?
2014-12-24 00:14:19	UltraMario	so does it have pages on characters from other series like the mario wiki does
2014-12-24 00:14:19	@Espyo	main and secondary games should be detailed
2014-12-24 00:14:29	@Espyo	cameos and such shouldn't really have a lot of depth
2014-12-24 00:14:30	UltraMario	or does it only cover the pikmin related content in smash bros
2014-12-24 00:14:37	UltraMario	well I meant like Smash Bros.
2014-12-24 00:15:00	UltraMario	how do you guys cover Smash Bros. is what I meant :P
2014-12-24 00:15:21	UltraMario	I'm assuming you guys handle the coverage differently than the MarioWiki

2014-12-27 12:21:30	Testyo	the further down the article, the more unrelated and it has FUSE support, doesn't say if this supports writes

2014-12-27 13:43:40	Shard1	Hello!
2014-12-27 13:43:57	Shard1	Is the chatroom also for leisure chats?
2014-12-27 13:49:15	@Espyo	hey
2014-12-27 13:49:16	@Espyo	yep
2014-12-27 13:49:39	@Espyo	me, Yoshi2 and J spend some time talking about game design and programming
2014-12-27 13:49:44	@Espyo	so it's not just Pikmin all day every day
2014-12-27 13:50:33	Shard1	I recently just got the new smash bros.
2014-12-27 13:51:18	@Espyo	same
2014-12-27 13:51:32	@Espyo	in fact, I'm reading Smashboards right now
2014-12-27 13:51:38	Shard1	For Glory one on one is crazy!
2014-12-27 13:51:38	@Espyo	people are really having trouble with All-Star...
2014-12-27 13:51:42	@Espyo	...and so am I
2014-12-27 13:51:49	@Espyo	sure is
2014-12-27 13:51:53	@Espyo	the whole game's pretty fun
2014-12-27 13:51:53	Shard1	I'm having trouble with For Glory!
2014-12-27 13:52:10	Shard1	I was fighting somebody and they were spamming a can
2014-12-27 13:53:19	@Espyo	jump over it
2014-12-27 13:53:39	Shard1	I was in the air and was recovering
2014-12-27 13:54:46	Shard1	Do you have a miiverse?
2014-12-27 13:54:52	@Espyo	mhm
2014-12-27 13:54:58	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/users/EspyoPT
2014-12-27 13:55:40	Shard1	I'm going to give you a follow
2014-12-27 13:55:43	Shard1	Look for me
2014-12-27 13:56:37	@Espyo	all right
2014-12-27 13:57:24	Shard1	Does Pikipidia have any events it hosts?
2014-12-27 13:57:52	@Espyo	we had a Mario Kart 8 tournament once
2014-12-27 13:57:55	@Espyo	but it never really got anywhere
2014-12-27 13:58:01	@Espyo	other than that, maybe in the future
2014-12-27 13:58:11	@Espyo	I guess we have a poll on the front page, but that's not really any event
2014-12-27 13:58:23	Shard1	Hmm.
2014-12-27 13:58:36	Shard1	I was trying to play online with my friends yesterday in smash
2014-12-27 13:58:48	Shard1	He was doing other stuff, so it was a fail
2014-12-27 14:00:36	Shard1	I just uploaded another video to youtube
2014-12-27 14:01:16	@Espyo	online with friends is pretty nice
2014-12-27 14:02:40	Shard1	Unless they don't put aside time to play with you
2014-12-27 14:03:25	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-12-27 14:03:55	Shard1	Who's your main? In Smash Bros?
2014-12-27 14:05:05	Yoshi2	usually, people should only agree to a play a game if they do have time for it
2014-12-27 14:05:30	Shard1	Yeah, he said he would, then when I called him he didn't pick up his cell
2014-12-27 14:06:18	Shard1	Wait, can put pictures in the chat?
2014-12-27 14:06:30	Shard1	I saw Yoshi2 do it once
2014-12-27 14:06:50	Yoshi2	you can put a link in your message
2014-12-27 14:07:12	Yoshi2	there are various image hosters which will give you a link when you upload your image
2014-12-27 14:07:43	Shard1	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/zlCfzSY0BjcPl69mOe
2014-12-27 14:07:56	@Espyo	I main Ness
2014-12-27 14:08:00	Shard1	That was from my excellent pausing abilities
2014-12-27 14:08:03	Yoshi2	Nintendo Land Pikmin
2014-12-27 14:08:06	Shard1	My main is Toon Link
2014-12-27 14:08:25	@Espyo	oh, I played Nintendo Land yesterday
2014-12-27 14:08:32	Yoshi2	I like Shulk quite a bit
2014-12-27 14:08:40	@Espyo	I got it as a prize for getting 2nd place at a Mario Kart 8 tournament at Comic Con
2014-12-27 14:08:41	Shard1	It was my first Wii U game
2014-12-27 14:08:45	@Espyo	Nintendo Land is SO much fun
2014-12-27 14:08:48	Shard1	I know
2014-12-27 14:08:57	@Espyo	heh, I have a friend that mains Shulk too
2014-12-27 14:08:59	Shard1	But those master requirements are crazy
2014-12-27 14:09:11	Yoshi2	Nintendo Land was bundled with the Deluxe Wii U when I bought it
2014-12-27 14:09:16	Shard1	I did master level 9 on Zelda: Battle Quest
2014-12-27 14:09:47	Shard1	Are any of you guys completionists?
2014-12-27 14:09:57	@Espyo	I try, but lately, I don't have much time to
2014-12-27 14:10:08	Shard1	I just HAVE to 100%
2014-12-27 14:10:08	Yoshi2	I can't play a few of the Nintendo Land games because I don't have a WiiMote+
2014-12-27 14:10:18	Shard1	Oh, that's too bad
2014-12-27 14:10:20	Yoshi2	the downside of being an early adaptor of the Wii
2014-12-27 14:10:38	Shard1	The Wii was my first console
2014-12-27 14:10:43	Shard1	With MKW
2014-12-27 14:11:02	Yoshi2	mine will soon be 8 years old
2014-12-27 14:11:29	Yoshi2	my first console is the GC, but I bought that one fairly late in 2005
2014-12-27 14:11:35	Yoshi2	close to the end of its life cycle
2014-12-27 14:11:44	Shard1	Are any of you guys self-proclaimed video game nerds?
2014-12-27 14:11:55	@Espyo	eh, kinda
2014-12-27 14:11:57	@Espyo	I mean, I love games
2014-12-27 14:11:59	Shard1	I like to think of myself as a geek
2014-12-27 14:12:06	@Espyo	but I don't go out of my way to make it my only thing in life
2014-12-27 14:12:11	Yoshi2	I'm a self-proclaimed tank nerd if that counts
2014-12-27 14:12:13	Shard1	Probably because I have glasses
2014-12-27 14:12:47	Shard1	But then again, I'm a huge music fanatic
2014-12-27 14:13:26	Shard1	Currently have Hyrule Warriors soundtrack, Pikmin 1 soundtrack, Pikmin 3 soundtrack, and Windwaker soundtrack
2014-12-27 14:14:08	Yoshi2	was the Pikmin 3 soundtrack officially released?
2014-12-27 14:14:22	Shard1	No
2014-12-27 14:14:25	Shard1	I burned it
2014-12-27 14:14:48	Shard1	From videos on youtube
2014-12-27 14:14:55	Yoshi2	I see
2014-12-27 14:14:56	Shard1	Thanks Gilvasunner
2014-12-27 14:15:50	Shard1	Do you guys have any amiibos?
2014-12-27 14:15:59	Yoshi2	I don't
2014-12-27 14:16:05	Shard1	I have Link
2014-12-27 14:16:10	Yoshi2	though I also don't have the Wii U smash bros yet
2014-12-27 14:16:15	Shard1	Oh
2014-12-27 14:16:25	Shard1	Well, I got Link before I got SMash Bros
2014-12-27 14:16:38	Shard1	Hyrule Warriors and MK8 bonuses
2014-12-27 14:16:46	Yoshi2	I wanted to buy it, but then I started to wait for the GC controller adapter to be in stock again
2014-12-27 14:16:55	Yoshi2	and I waited
2014-12-27 14:17:01	Yoshi2	and before I knew it, one month passed or so
2014-12-27 14:17:06	@Espyo	I have a Marth Amiibo
2014-12-27 14:17:09	@Espyo	level 50 already
2014-12-27 14:17:19	Shard1	Links level 50 as well
2014-12-27 14:17:22	@Espyo	it really doesn't take long to grind them
2014-12-27 14:17:26	Shard1	Yeah
2014-12-27 14:17:30	Yoshi2	I've seen various amiibos in store, among them Marth
2014-12-27 14:17:32	@Espyo	just have them fight level 9 CPUs and after an hour, it's done
2014-12-27 14:17:32	Shard1	It was two days and already finished
2014-12-27 14:17:44	Shard1	Oh, I just fought it
2014-12-27 14:17:51	Shard1	What about Mii fighters?
2014-12-27 14:17:55	@Espyo	I fought it some too
2014-12-27 14:18:00	@Espyo	but left it with CPUs most of the time
2014-12-27 14:18:07	Shard1	Mine is a swordfighter
2014-12-27 14:18:10	@Espyo	hm, I have a few Mii fighters, but I don't really play them much
2014-12-27 14:18:15	@Espyo	I made three for me, one of each type
2014-12-27 14:18:21	Shard1	I made two
2014-12-27 14:18:36	Shard1	My Swordfighter is a defender
2014-12-27 14:18:43	Shard1	and my amiibo is speed/def
2014-12-27 14:18:51	Shard1	So he is crazy hard to defeat
2014-12-27 14:18:59	Yoshi2	but deals little damage
2014-12-27 14:19:13	Shard1	Well.. He has some attack buff
2014-12-27 14:19:25	Shard1	I did it so he doesn't have any negatives anywhere
2014-12-27 14:21:03	Shard1	Help me out here, what's the deal with Fire Emblem and Xenoblade?
2014-12-27 14:21:15	Shard1	Because I have no idea what in the world goes on in them
2014-12-27 14:25:22	Shard1	Gosh, my youtube isn't very popular
2014-12-27 14:27:29	Shard1	I should probably mention that I beat my amiibo
2014-12-27 14:29:20	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User:Shard1 by Shard1 (+67) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Shard1&curid=17813&diff=143733&oldid=142961
2014-12-27 14:29:41	Shard1	Ok, what do those numbers mean when somebody makes an edit?
2014-12-27 14:35:44	Shard1	I find it mildly irritating that they didn't add any new pikmin music to the new smash besides Garden of Hope
2014-12-27 14:38:04	Yoshi2	Shard1: the +67 means that, in total, your change adds 67 more characters to the article
2014-12-27 14:38:06	Yoshi2	I think
2014-12-27 14:38:14	Shard1	Oh
2014-12-27 14:40:24	Yoshi2	either characters, or bytes
2014-12-27 14:40:58	Yoshi2	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Shard1&action=history mentions how many bytes each version of the page needs, so the number probably refers to bytes
2014-12-27 14:41:03	Shard1	You know, I wish they made another cross-over game besides smash bros.
2014-12-27 14:41:12	Shard1	Ok, got
2014-12-27 14:41:15	Shard1	it
2014-12-27 14:42:33	Yoshi2	another cross-over game with characters from as many different series as in smash bros?
2014-12-27 14:42:51	Shard1	Well, not necessarily as many.
2014-12-27 14:43:31	Yoshi2	there have been other cross-overs with characters from two or three game series
2014-12-27 14:43:40	Shard1	like...
2014-12-27 14:44:01	Yoshi2	the MK8 DLC adds Link and two characters from Animal Crossing
2014-12-27 14:44:27	Shard1	I know that one, but I meant like where they actually interact
