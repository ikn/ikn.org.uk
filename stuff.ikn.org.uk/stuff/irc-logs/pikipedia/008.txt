2014-08-15 20:52:31	@J	because they all said 0C

2014-08-15 20:53:20	@Espyo	oh, so he was kicked out for spam, huh
2014-08-15 20:53:47	@Espyo	yep, right there, excess flood
2014-08-15 21:26:57	@PikFan	oh boy, what happened here
2014-08-15 21:27:39	@Espyo	explosions
2014-08-15 21:28:55	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-15 21:29:14	@PikFan	speaking of explosions, if I pop my wrinklers now, I'll get 145 sextillion
2014-08-15 21:29:35	@Espyo	overkill
2014-08-15 21:29:42	@Espyo	obviously, you're waiting for the update, right?
2014-08-15 21:29:48	@PikFan	it isn't enough
2014-08-15 21:30:20	@PikFan	I need 450 sextillion to buy the remaining prisms
2014-08-15 21:30:41	@Espyo	I'm not following
2014-08-15 21:30:43	@PikFan	almost a third there
2014-08-15 21:30:47	@Espyo	won't CPS by like enormous after the update?
2014-08-15 21:30:51	@Espyo	if you pop then you'll get loads
2014-08-15 21:31:08	@PikFan	yeah, but remember that prisms will be more expensive
2014-08-15 21:31:29	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-08-15 21:32:40	@PikFan	iirc, the price/power ratio will be waaay lower after the update
2014-08-15 21:33:38	@PikFan	now I'm kinda hoping the update isn't released, so I can get bicentennial
2014-08-15 21:33:52	@PikFan	*-now
2014-08-15 21:34:04	@Espyo	oh
2014-08-15 21:34:20	@Espyo	ok, one way to make Bulborbs a LOT more terrifying: increase their chomping speed
2014-08-15 21:34:36	@PikFan	eugh e_o
2014-08-15 21:34:39	@Espyo	I'm adding a Bulborb to the engine, and his chomping speed is way too high, he's a murderous machine
2014-08-15 21:34:55	@PikFan	how many deaths per second?
2014-08-15 21:34:58	@Espyo	I'm scared to even get close
2014-08-15 21:35:06	@Espyo	considering he eats 5 in one gulp, like in P2
2014-08-15 21:35:10	@Espyo	probably 10 DPS
2014-08-15 21:35:17	@Espyo	let me check for sure
2014-08-15 21:35:20	@PikFan	yikes
2014-08-15 21:35:21	@Espyo	the chomping animation is...
2014-08-15 21:35:47	@Espyo	 0.9 seconds each chomp
2014-08-15 21:35:51	@Espyo	so... not really 10 DPS
2014-08-15 21:35:57	@Espyo	more like 6
2014-08-15 21:36:10	@Espyo	luckily though, I haven't programmed attack angles
2014-08-15 21:36:18	@Espyo	I mean, right now, an enemy attacks if the prey is NEAR
2014-08-15 21:36:21	@Espyo	doesn't matter if they're facing it
2014-08-15 21:36:31	@Espyo	so... sometimes it's stuck chomping nothing
2014-08-15 21:37:41	@Espyo	much better now
2014-08-15 21:38:52	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-15 21:38:54	@PikFan	also, outside
2014-08-15 21:39:01	@Espyo	all right
2014-08-15 21:39:05	@Espyo	I'll release the new version soon
2014-08-15 21:39:09	@Espyo	I have to do it before the day's over
2014-08-15 22:05:06	@Espyo	ok, so I had three incredible dreams today
2014-08-15 22:05:13	@Espyo	the first is not chatroom-friendly
2014-08-15 22:05:31	@Espyo	oh, and I should point out, these dreams answered some questions about what we dream
2014-08-15 22:05:44	@Espyo	on the second, I was playing Pikmin 3, except it was real-life
2014-08-15 22:05:57	@Espyo	and I was fighting against a life-sized Emperor Bulblax, about the size of a kitchen pot
2014-08-15 22:06:09	@Espyo	I fought it by whipping at it with a towel, and did so in my own bathroom
2014-08-15 22:06:14	@Espyo	...
2014-08-15 22:06:22	@Espyo	anyway, the interesting thing was
2014-08-15 22:06:33	@Espyo	I distinctively remember hearing the boss music from Pikmin 2
2014-08-15 22:06:48	@Espyo	and at one point, it did an attack that changed the music
2014-08-15 22:07:02	@Espyo	it was a small music snippet like when the P2 Emperor Bulblax jumps, or the Snagrets un/burrow
2014-08-15 22:07:09	@Espyo	except it was different
2014-08-15 22:07:28	@Espyo	it was the victory fanfare bit, but cut-off after 2 seconds, much like the music snippets I mentioned
2014-08-15 22:07:38	@Espyo	I thought it was a new battle theme variation
2014-08-15 22:07:44	@Espyo	but it was all a dream
2014-08-15 22:07:52	@Espyo	the thing on this dream is that it proves people can DREAM MUSIC
2014-08-15 22:08:44	@Espyo	on the third dream, I was the third member of the Game Grumps, and I was on some episodes with them
2014-08-15 22:08:55	@Espyo	I was speaking in English then, and at two points, I stopped to speak in Portuguese
2014-08-15 22:09:05	@Espyo	once because my grandma was interrupting me, another time because it slipped
2014-08-15 22:09:19	@Espyo	also every time it was me talking, there were minor hesitations and accents, but every time it was them talking, it was fine
2014-08-15 22:09:43	@Espyo	which means bilingual people can dream in either language, in BOTH languages, AND are fully aware of the quality of the language's knowledge
2014-08-15 22:09:46	@Espyo	it's... amazing

2014-08-15 23:08:18	@PikFan	interesting
2014-08-15 23:08:32	@Espyo	problem is people probably won't believe me
2014-08-15 23:08:39	@Espyo	because having one dream that answers a question, sure
2014-08-15 23:08:43	@Espyo	but having three on the same night?
2014-08-15 23:09:08	@Espyo	a friend asked me if I dreamed in English too, at one point
2014-08-15 23:09:11	@Espyo	but I couldn't really tell
2014-08-15 23:09:21	@PikFan	I think I've dreamed video game music also
2014-08-15 23:09:23	@Espyo	I think I had a few dreams where I THINK I remember they were in English
2014-08-15 23:09:27	@Espyo	but this dream blasts it off completely
2014-08-15 23:09:33	@Espyo	apparently, it's likely that you would've
2014-08-15 23:10:15	@PikFan	...apparently?
2014-08-15 23:10:35	@Espyo	apparently because now it's proven that it's possible
2014-08-15 23:10:37	@Espyo	at least from me
2014-08-15 23:10:41	@PikFan	oh
2014-08-15 23:10:58	@PikFan	what was the third dream?
2014-08-15 23:11:03	@Espyo	you mean the first?
2014-08-15 23:11:09	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-15 23:11:24	@Espyo	you know when you wake up and all you remember is nothingness?
2014-08-15 23:11:27	@Espyo	it's as if you never dreamed?
2014-08-15 23:11:36	@PikFan	mhm?
2014-08-15 23:11:55	@Espyo	I had a wet dream in which I can't remember happening
2014-08-15 23:12:02	@Espyo	don't unspoiler that if you don't want the answer
2014-08-15 23:12:10	@Espyo	that's why it's not Pikmin-chatroom-safe
2014-08-15 23:12:17	@PikFan	oh wow
2014-08-15 23:12:18	@Espyo	then again, I don't think we have many kids here atm
2014-08-15 23:12:31	@Espyo	also I worded that stupidly
2014-08-15 23:12:35	@Espyo	>in which I can't remember happening
2014-08-15 23:12:37	@Espyo	uh, you get what I meant
2014-08-15 23:12:47	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-15 23:13:00	@Espyo	I've had crazy dreams, but today was insane
2014-08-15 23:13:09	@Espyo	I pointed this down in case I ever need to turn it in for a Nobel Prize
2014-08-15 23:13:18	@PikFan	the power of the mind sure is amazing
2014-08-15 23:13:24	@Espyo	very
2014-08-15 23:13:31	@Espyo	it fascinates me because of that
2014-08-15 23:13:38	@Espyo	if I weren't an IT guy, I'd probably be a psychologist
2014-08-15 23:13:57	@PikFan	heh

2014-08-17 20:49:30	@PikFan	for the most part, it's good, but I attacked the Red Bulborb
2014-08-17 20:49:36	@PikFan	that went badly
2014-08-17 20:50:07	@PikFan	like, it kept moving in place, and would eat Pikmin at random
2014-08-17 20:50:23	@PikFan	and I couldn't call back Pikmin that were shaken off
2014-08-17 20:52:25	@Espyo	yeah, it's messed up
2014-08-17 20:52:28	@Espyo	what about the CBN?
2014-08-17 20:52:41	@PikFan	oh, there's a CBN in it?
2014-08-17 20:52:48	@Espyo	to the east
2014-08-17 20:52:51	@Espyo	of the RB
2014-08-17 20:52:54	@PikFan	hah, I must've been too busy fighting the bulborb
2014-08-17 20:52:58	@Espyo	hehe
2014-08-17 20:53:01	@Espyo	but yeah, thanks
2014-08-17 20:53:03	@Espyo	performance?
2014-08-17 20:53:06	@Espyo	was it choppy or smooth?
2014-08-17 20:53:25	@PikFan	the battle was definitely choppy
2014-08-17 20:53:41	@Espyo	I meant the performance of the game as a whole
2014-08-17 20:53:45	@Espyo	like, the screen
2014-08-17 20:53:55	@PikFan	you mean like frames per second?
2014-08-17 20:53:58	@Espyo	did the screen display everything smoothly or choppy
2014-08-17 20:53:59	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2014-08-17 20:54:05	@PikFan	ah, I se
2014-08-17 20:54:07	@PikFan	*see
2014-08-17 20:54:11	@PikFan	yeah, it did good
2014-08-17 20:54:16	@PikFan	it went smoothly
2014-08-17 20:54:55	@Espyo	good, I was worried
2014-08-17 20:55:05	@Espyo	what about the controls? were they intuitive?
2014-08-17 20:55:37	@PikFan	they're alright
2014-08-17 20:56:01	@PikFan	I can't switch between Pikmin types/stages
2014-08-17 20:56:16	@Espyo	can't remember if I have a control to switch between maturity
2014-08-17 20:56:24	@Espyo	but types, you press whistle while holding throw
2014-08-17 20:56:29	@Espyo	like in NPC!
2014-08-17 20:57:08	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2014-08-17 21:00:23	@PikFan	the Red Bulborb won't stop chasing me
2014-08-17 21:00:50	@Espyo	it has a huge sight range
2014-08-17 21:00:56	@Espyo	you can outrun it with Louie
2014-08-17 21:01:00	@Espyo	...but not anybody else, I don't think
2014-08-17 21:01:15	@PikFan	can you decrease its sight range?
2014-08-17 21:01:20	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-17 21:01:32	@Espyo	 /Game_data/Types/Enemies/RB/Data.txt
2014-08-17 21:01:39	@Espyo	there should be a "sight_range" or something of the sort
2014-08-17 21:01:42	@Espyo	just change its value

2014-08-19 19:28:15	@J	it seems like it wants to undo the import edit, but I don't know what that will do
2014-08-19 19:28:16	@Espyo	better safe than sorry
2014-08-19 19:28:18	@J	should probably just undo
2014-08-19 19:28:18	@J	yeah
2014-08-19 19:28:44	@J	yeah, I usually get back around 6:20 to 7:00, then I eat

2014-08-19 19:29:28	@Espyo	stuff I'd do at home, like work on the engine

2014-08-19 19:30:19	@Espyo	obviously it'd have to be loose snippets at a time

2014-08-19 19:31:28	@Espyo	they'll be fixed with the bot, no worry
2014-08-19 19:31:31	@J	I think a rollback may have been the right choice
2014-08-19 19:31:41	@Espyo	as long as the bot DOES mark that the pages need a merge, we can take care of everything
2014-08-19 19:32:46	@Espyo	all right, funny tale of the day
2014-08-19 19:32:50	@Espyo	or sad, depending on how you look at it

2014-08-19 19:32:59	@Espyo	I asked my college to issue a diploma
2014-08-19 19:33:11	@Espyo	they said they couldn't issue it because I have a tuition fine that hasn't been paid from last year
2014-08-19 19:33:15	@Espyo	the fine is worth... 2 cents
2014-08-19 19:33:56	@Espyo	so I'm just gonna write an e-mail for a sec, because there's NO way I can pay 2 cents without going there personally
2014-08-19 19:34:04	@Espyo	we'll still have the edit history
2014-08-19 19:34:25	@Espyo	I DID send an e-mail yesterday, but the bloody system didn't send it
2014-08-19 19:34:32	@Espyo	for an engineering college, they sure have crappy systems
2014-08-19 19:35:49	@Espyo	There was an error saving the sent message.

2014-08-19 19:40:03	@Espyo	what other words are there?
2014-08-19 19:41:08	@J	what did you do wrong that would have a 2 cent fine?
2014-08-19 19:42:37	@Espyo	excellent question
2014-08-19 19:42:39	@Espyo	I have no bleeding idea
2014-08-19 19:42:54	@Espyo	I probably paid a month's tuition 3 minutes after some limit
2014-08-19 19:45:22	@Espyo	now that that's taken care of...
2014-08-19 19:45:35	@Espyo	won't the bot re-import the edits (and do nothing), go to the Pikipedia version, and then add the notice?
2014-08-19 19:45:52	@Espyo	oh, if the most recent version is already the Pikipedia one, it'll skip the 2nd step, right
2014-08-19 19:46:12	@Espyo	and because we reverted the Pikipedia version which WAS the most recent, the bot'll never put up the Pikipedia version
2014-08-19 19:46:25	@Espyo	well, if we're meant to revert our reverts, it's at least kind of easy
2014-08-19 19:46:41	@Espyo	because quite a few of those pages are Pikmin 3 stuff we don't have
2014-08-19 19:46:46	@J	it's harder than that
2014-08-19 19:46:50	@J	I'm working on it
2014-08-19 19:46:59	@Espyo	and yeah, I tried some MIDI soundfonts, it was probably the most reliable source I had, but I guess they matched all right
2014-08-19 19:47:02	@Espyo	better than horns, at least
2014-08-19 19:47:08	@J	fair enough
2014-08-19 19:47:09	@Espyo	I could check the Pikmin 2 soundfont
2014-08-19 19:47:26	@Espyo	plus if the person who edited that wanted to vandalize
2014-08-19 19:47:31	@Espyo	they did a VERY poor job at it
2014-08-19 19:48:06	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxEFKzQBXCQ reminds me of this
2014-08-19 20:01:25	@J	okay, that seems to be working (the revert)
2014-08-19 20:01:52	@Espyo	good
2014-08-19 20:02:38	@J	no more yellow links all over the place
2014-08-19 20:06:59	@J	okay, done
2014-08-19 20:09:00	@Espyo	gonna give it a test drive
2014-08-19 20:09:01	@Espyo	*?
2014-08-19 20:12:19	@J	I need to run the get/transform parts again to update everything to latest
2014-08-19 20:12:25	@J	since there've been edits in the last 2 weeks
2014-08-19 20:12:38	@Espyo	yep
2014-08-19 20:13:57	@J	now, when you finished the other namespaces, did you check for any conflicts/failed files?
2014-08-19 20:18:01	@Espyo	there were a few
2014-08-19 20:18:08	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/merge-failed.tar.bz2
2014-08-19 20:18:09	@Espyo	but most of them were redirects or videos
2014-08-19 20:18:10	@J	I got those
2014-08-19 20:18:13	@Espyo	so... nothing that really failed
2014-08-19 20:18:22	@J	okay, good
2014-08-19 20:18:33	@J	just make sure you check all the ones you have
2014-08-19 20:19:12	@Espyo	does it have to be ALL all...?
2014-08-19 20:19:24	@Espyo	after a bit I just gave up and assumed they were all the same problem
2014-08-19 20:19:29	@Espyo	the pattern checked out
2014-08-19 20:19:33	@Espyo	plus I double-checked several times
2014-08-19 20:20:22	@Espyo	...oh, there's a conflicts file
2014-08-19 20:20:26	@Espyo	welp, mine's big
2014-08-19 20:20:52	@Espyo	the file conflicts one is exactly the same as yours
2014-08-19 20:21:06	@J	I probably just sent that to you
2014-08-19 20:21:13	@Espyo	users too
2014-08-19 20:21:16	@Espyo	hm, probably
2014-08-19 20:21:20	@Espyo	let me check the edit time
2014-08-19 20:21:33	@J	for users, I just removed a few that I know were already on Pikipedia
2014-08-19 20:21:35	@Espyo	 29th of August
2014-08-19 20:21:39	@Espyo	ah, right
2014-08-19 20:22:30	@J	I would suggest we give the rest to the Pikmin Wiki admins, let them notify active users however they want to that their user pages haven't been migrated because an account with the same name exists on both wikis
2014-08-19 20:24:06	@Espyo	yeah, it's for the best
2014-08-19 20:26:02	@J	the file ones I think we might have to check manually
2014-08-19 20:26:09	@J	unless there's a sensible way to test duplicates first
2014-08-19 20:26:26	@J	preferably one that doesn't involve downloading all the files
2014-08-19 20:27:09	@Espyo	probably not
2014-08-19 20:29:37	@J	well, downloading them all will be faster than checking manually
2014-08-19 20:30:01	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-19 20:36:21	@J	so yeah, anyway, I did hear you had a new job
2014-08-19 20:51:02	@Espyo	yep
2014-08-19 20:51:09	@Espyo	I thought I told you I got accepted
2014-08-19 20:51:14	@Espyo	oh, I guess it happened less than 2 weeks ago
2014-08-19 20:51:33	@Espyo	I'll detail more after dinner
2014-08-19 21:21:56	@PikFan	Espyo: what'd you even do to warrant a... 2 cent fine?
2014-08-19 21:22:09	@PikFan	how is that possible
2014-08-19 21:23:36	@Espyo	like I said, good question
2014-08-19 21:23:38	@Espyo	it's possible here

2014-08-19 21:24:09	@PikFan	how's the move going? seems like you ran into stuff
2014-08-19 21:25:14	@PikFan	oh, you're just undoing stuff that already got merged in articles
2014-08-19 21:25:41	@PikFan	why'd some even get merged
2014-08-19 21:26:43	@Espyo	ONE run actually worked, when I had the bot
2014-08-19 21:26:46	@Espyo	nothing else ever worked after

2014-08-19 21:28:35	@PikFan	no better way to do it?
2014-08-19 21:30:54	@J	we considered putting the Pikmin Wiki histories into a different namespace
2014-08-19 21:31:03	@PikFan	oh hey, there's a Miiverse post about it: https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAAYUKliCfAOtg

Quantity of edits should not be a goal; rather usefulness of them should be."
2014-08-19 21:32:23	@PikFan	yes, excactly
2014-08-19 21:32:26	@PikFan	*exactly
2014-08-19 21:36:20	@Espyo	who said that?
2014-08-19 21:36:31	@PikFan	it was a comment on the blog post
2014-08-19 21:37:12	@Espyo	on Miiverse?
2014-08-19 21:37:34	@PikFan	on Pikmin Wiki
2014-08-19 21:37:43	@Espyo	oh, I see it
2014-08-19 21:38:17	@Espyo	so this guy appeared on the Skype group today
2014-08-19 21:38:24	@Espyo	we met each other and such
2014-08-19 21:38:28	@Espyo	he was the guy that made the cursor
2014-08-19 21:38:40	@Espyo	he also started making claims about him doing great stuff that HAS to be bogus
2014-08-19 21:38:53	@PikFan	who's this guy?
2014-08-19 21:39:17	@Espyo	for one thing, he said he had managed to glitch P3 so badly, that he made the game run unused cutscene scripts
2014-08-19 21:39:30	@PikFan	.../what/
2014-08-19 21:39:43	@Espyo	I figured it'd be possible, somewhat
2014-08-19 21:39:49	@Espyo	because at one point somebody found some unused text in P3
2014-08-19 21:39:52	@Espyo	they had to do it somehow
2014-08-19 21:39:56	@Espyo	but he put a bit too crazily
2014-08-19 21:40:09	@Espyo	Dave10772, according to Skype
2014-08-19 21:40:15	@PikFan	was he acting pri—ah, him
2014-08-19 21:40:22	@PikFan	he's the theorist
2014-08-19 21:40:26	@Espyo	yeah, he said
2014-08-19 21:40:35	@Espyo	then, he said he was the first to translate the Japanese P3 page (seems reasonable)
2014-08-19 21:40:44	@Espyo	and that he found spoilers to the ending inside the page code (seems not reasonable)
2014-08-19 21:40:53	@PikFan	I still don't think that Pikmin liquefy into nectar inside the onion >_>
2014-08-19 21:41:02	@Espyo	some theories go too far
2014-08-19 21:41:11	@PikFan	you can say that again
2014-08-19 21:41:12	@Espyo	that's why on the wiki, we will only use the ones that really don't go too far
2014-08-19 21:41:12	@Espyo	if any
2014-08-19 21:41:22	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-19 21:41:26	@Espyo	you know when they ask about keeping the cursor and other things we don't really like?
2014-08-19 21:41:32	@PikFan	mhm?
2014-08-19 21:41:34	@Espyo	until now, the only reason we had was "professionalism"
2014-08-19 21:41:38	@Espyo	I gave it some thought today
2014-08-19 21:41:40	@Espyo	and I came to a conclusion
2014-08-19 21:41:42	@Espyo	it's not just that
2014-08-19 21:41:51	@Espyo	Pikipedia aims to be professional, but always tied in with the community
2014-08-19 21:42:00	@Espyo	that's why we have strategy guides on caves, treasures and enemies
2014-08-19 21:42:17	@Espyo	if we were just a cold encyclopedia, we wouldn't have those
2014-08-19 21:42:29	@Espyo	we can keep stuff that's for and by the community, but it has to be professional
2014-08-19 21:42:39	@Espyo	also, we aim to please all Pikmin fans, of all ages and skill levels
2014-08-19 21:42:50	@Espyo	and that's why we can't have the cursor, only the most "immature" fans would like it
2014-08-19 21:42:55	@Espyo	they seemed to understand
2014-08-19 21:43:07	@Espyo	but let's keep this in mind should they ask about keeping another thing we might not like in the future
2014-08-19 21:43:18	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-19 22:05:06	@J	trying some imports, but there might be no changes for a while since lots of edits will be duplicated and they don't show up
2014-08-19 22:06:08	@J	this will be limited by my upload speed, which is currently around 100KiB/s
2014-08-19 22:06:58	@J	oh, it got to the edit stage
2014-08-19 22:07:20	@Espyo	will you run it overnight when it happens?
2014-08-19 22:07:45	@J	I'll see how it goes
2014-08-19 22:08:25	@J	oh, it's not adding /merge pages
2014-08-19 22:08:28	@J	I know why
2014-08-19 22:10:41	@Espyo	heh
2014-08-19 22:16:18	@J	okay, I'll just run the whole thing now
2014-08-19 22:16:23	@J	see how it gets on
2014-08-19 22:18:27	@Espyo	this can't end well
2014-08-19 22:20:09	@J	let me know if you see anyone weird showing up in RC
2014-08-19 22:20:12	@J	*anything...
2014-08-19 22:22:49	@J	[20:51:14] @Espyo oh, I guess it happened less than 2 weeks ago   
2014-08-19 22:22:49	@J	[20:51:33] @Espyo I'll detail more after dinner
2014-08-19 22:23:00	@J	beep
2014-08-19 22:26:54	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-08-19 22:27:16	@Espyo	so, because this is a professional internship, I just get placed in jobs on the mother company that fit my profile
2014-08-19 22:27:22	@Espyo	right now, I'm doing a pretty boring thing
2014-08-19 22:27:44	@Espyo	an airplane company gave us a new cockpit display, and the list of requirements
2014-08-19 22:27:54	@Espyo	you know, what the display and its modules should do
2014-08-19 22:28:01	@Espyo	we are charged of writing test cases for every requirement
2014-08-19 22:28:02	@Espyo	that's it
2014-08-19 22:28:09	@Espyo	it's pretty dull and long and repetitive
2014-08-19 22:28:39	@Espyo	plus half of the people are on vacation, the client isn't replying to our questions, and they just aren't really sure what to give to the interns to do
2014-08-19 22:28:50	@Espyo	so we're either idling, or doing some boring part of test writing
2014-08-19 22:34:35	@PikFan	uh-oh http://www.pikminwiki.com/Dawn_Pustules
2014-08-19 22:35:02	@Espyo	oh, don't worry
2014-08-19 22:35:02	@PikFan	how come it's not separating the PW page off?
2014-08-19 22:35:04	@Espyo	template trouble
2014-08-19 22:35:12	@Espyo	err
2014-08-19 22:35:37	@Espyo	oh, it's just importing for now
2014-08-19 22:35:40	@Espyo	at least this file
2014-08-19 22:35:52	@Espyo	he'll do the canon version + template soon
2014-08-19 22:35:58	@Espyo	(I hope)
2014-08-19 22:36:19	@PikFan	by canon, you mean Pikipedia, yeah?

2014-08-19 23:02:56	@J	oh, it's just an internship at the moment?
2014-08-19 23:03:25	@Espyo	a professional one
2014-08-19 23:03:43	@Espyo	I'm not so much in a company as I am in a program that gives professional internship to newly-graduates
2014-08-19 23:03:53	@Espyo	it's still a job
2014-08-19 23:04:04	@Espyo	not like those times where you call a guy an intern just to avoid paying him
2014-08-19 23:04:21	@J	I guess the main difference is that an internship is normally fixed-term
2014-08-19 23:04:26	@J	rather than permanent employment
2014-08-19 23:04:31	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-19 23:04:34	@Espyo	also the pay's probably less
2014-08-19 23:04:37	@Espyo	but it's still hefty
2014-08-19 23:04:39	@Espyo	 700€ a month
2014-08-19 23:04:40	Testyo	700 € = £ 598.64  / $ 949.48 
2014-08-19 23:04:48	@Espyo	oh... it worked
2014-08-19 23:04:55	@Espyo	I found scattered tools to recompress .rarc and .szs
2014-08-19 23:05:03	@Espyo	will Pikmin 2 accept this new file?
2014-08-19 23:05:08	@Espyo	if I post a screenshot, that means it did
2014-08-19 23:05:22	@J	so it is an internship?
2014-08-19 23:05:24	@J	for how long?
2014-08-19 23:06:09	@Espyo	 12 months
2014-08-19 23:06:16	@Espyo	it is an internship, yeah
2014-08-19 23:06:29	@Espyo	it's just that sometimes companies use internship as an excuse to have workers for free
2014-08-19 23:06:32	@Espyo	not the case here
2014-08-19 23:06:50	@J	hmm, I see what you mean
2014-08-19 23:07:02	@Espyo	oh, well, there's a problem
2014-08-19 23:07:04	@Espyo	the new file is too large
2014-08-19 23:07:05	@Espyo	dammit
2014-08-19 23:07:13	@Espyo	it compressed at the highest ratio possible, according to this
2014-08-19 23:07:22	@Espyo	J, when will your GameCube image thing be ready?
2014-08-19 23:07:28	@J	a million years
2014-08-19 23:07:31	@Espyo	apparently yours is the only in the world that doesn't complain about bigger files
2014-08-19 23:07:36	@Espyo	doesn't that thing you send me ages ago work?
2014-08-19 23:07:41	@Espyo	...provided I don't resize the window
2014-08-19 23:07:42	@J	probably
2014-08-19 23:07:44	@J	yeah
2014-08-19 23:07:44	@Espyo	...or drag it
2014-08-19 23:08:00	@Espyo	I think it worked once... here goes
2014-08-19 23:09:08	@J	my current programming todo list, in priority order, is: this merge, finishing a streaming RSS library, a YouTube subscription RSS server, finishing the rewrite of my game engine's event handling, then probably the GameCube thing
2014-08-19 23:09:16	@Espyo	that was quick
2014-08-19 23:09:24	@Espyo	hmm, fair enough
2014-08-19 23:09:28	@Espyo	all right, moment of truth
2014-08-19 23:09:49	@Espyo	don't toy with me, game
2014-08-19 23:09:50	@Espyo	it didn't crash
2014-08-19 23:09:55	@Espyo	PRETTY sure it should've crashed
2014-08-19 23:10:00	@Espyo	because it always does, nothing EVER works
2014-08-19 23:10:09	@Espyo	oh uh... this Pikmin 2 image has no sounds
2014-08-19 23:10:10	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-08-19 23:10:29	@Espyo	still couldn't find a way to strip the .aw sound effect file so that you only get the C-stick instruments
2014-08-19 23:11:03	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Dolphin%202014-08-19%2023-10-44-10.png
2014-08-19 23:11:05	@Espyo	YES
2014-08-19 23:11:08	@Espyo	YES
2014-08-19 23:11:40	@PikFan	...Lolice?
2014-08-19 23:11:51	@Espyo	Novice -> Lolice
2014-08-19 23:11:53	@Espyo	because lol
2014-08-19 23:12:01	@Espyo	do you know what this means?
2014-08-19 23:12:08	@Espyo	like, half of Pikmin 2's content is behind .szs files
2014-08-19 23:12:11	@Espyo	we couldn't edit these before
2014-08-19 23:12:13	@Espyo	but now we CAN
2014-08-19 23:12:20	@Espyo	we can edit all these hidden things
2014-08-19 23:12:22	@Espyo	does means MODDING
2014-08-19 23:12:22	@PikFan	wait, really?
2014-08-19 23:12:29	@PikFan	sweeeeeeeeeeet
2014-08-19 23:12:29	@Espyo	except... nobody will ever really mod anything, BUT THEY CAN
2014-08-19 23:12:37	@Espyo	and more importantly, it'll help us understand how the game works
2014-08-19 23:12:45	@Espyo	reading files and guessing what they mean is one thing
2014-08-19 23:12:50	@Espyo	editing them and seeing the new effects is another
2014-08-19 23:13:13	@PikFan	wait, some people already mod the game
2014-08-19 23:13:21	@PikFan	they make custom cave layouts
2014-08-19 23:13:34	@Espyo	yeah, but caves are in simple text files, outside of .szs
2014-08-19 23:13:42	@PikFan	...oh
2014-08-19 23:14:06	@J	that's great
2014-08-19 23:14:32	@PikFan	what /are/ .szs files anyway
2014-08-19 23:14:39	@J	at some point, I was thinking about making the GameCube editor thing transparently open up archives in the file manager and let you modify the files inside
2014-08-19 23:14:50	@J	and maybe embed a text editor for quick changes
2014-08-19 23:14:53	@Espyo	yeah, but that's impossible
2014-08-19 23:14:56	@Espyo	all games have different formats
2014-08-19 23:14:58	@Espyo	(almost all)
2014-08-19 23:15:04	@Espyo	PikFan: you know zip?
2014-08-19 23:15:04	@J	well, for common formats, of course
2014-08-19 23:15:07	@Espyo	it's Nintendo's .zip format
2014-08-19 23:15:08	@PikFan	yeah?
2014-08-19 23:15:11	@Espyo	simply put
2014-08-19 23:15:14	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-08-19 23:15:16	@Espyo	and inside, they have a .rarc file
2014-08-19 23:15:22	@Espyo	which is luckily a lot simpler
2014-08-19 23:15:22	@J	formats I could be bothered with, anyway
2014-08-19 23:15:31	@PikFan	and you had to figure out how to unzip them
2014-08-19 23:15:34	@Espyo	yeah, not all formats
2014-08-19 23:15:38	@Espyo	no, unzipping is easy
2014-08-19 23:15:41	@Espyo	we've done that for years now
2014-08-19 23:15:45	@Espyo	re-zipping was the hard part
2014-08-19 23:15:56	@Espyo	https://github.com/RenolY2/yaz0-decode-encode the tool I found to rezip .szs files came about 4 months ago
2014-08-19 23:16:00	@PikFan	re-zipping?
2014-08-19 23:16:10	@Espyo	ok, here's what I did
2014-08-19 23:16:17	@Espyo	the game's text is behind a .szs and .rarc
2014-08-19 23:16:24	@Espyo	I used old tools we've always had to unzip the .szs
2014-08-19 23:16:29	@Espyo	which left me with a .rarc
2014-08-19 23:16:34	@Espyo	then used a tool to extract the .rarc
2014-08-19 23:16:37	@Espyo	this left me with text files
2014-08-19 23:16:44	@Espyo	(not really, but they edit like text files, so who cares)
2014-08-19 23:16:51	@Espyo	I changed Novice to Lolice with a simple text editor
2014-08-19 23:17:02	@Espyo	then used a newish tool to repack the files into a new .rarc
2014-08-19 23:17:09	@Espyo	then used this tool I linked to repack the .rarc into a .szs
2014-08-19 23:17:17	@Espyo	then used J's tool to put the .szs back into the game
2014-08-19 23:17:18	@Espyo	and...
2014-08-19 23:17:36	@Espyo	I've searched around, and tools to repack .rarc aren't really that new
2014-08-19 23:17:44	@Espyo	because as it turns out, .rarc is pretty darn simple
2014-08-19 23:18:05	@PikFan	but why is rezipping so hard?
2014-08-19 23:18:36	@Espyo	it doesn't use the same method as any known "normal" zip process
2014-08-19 23:18:44	@Espyo	we have .zip, .rar, .7z, .tar, .gz
2014-08-19 23:18:53	@PikFan	right, because it's a game—it's specialized
2014-08-19 23:18:58	@Espyo	(either .tar or .gz might not be compression things, J will hit me if that's the case)
2014-08-19 23:19:08	@Espyo	yeah, I guess they rather create their own thing
2014-08-19 23:19:13	@Espyo	it could've been more optimal for their games
2014-08-19 23:19:15	@Espyo	or hardware
2014-08-19 23:19:29	@Espyo	or maybe they couldn't afford the stuff to pack things with the likes of .rar
2014-08-19 23:19:35	@Espyo	and .7z wasn't around back then
2014-08-19 23:19:41	@Espyo	also MAYBE they were afraid of hackers
2014-08-19 23:19:45	@PikFan	they probably don't want—yeah
2014-08-19 23:19:50	@Espyo	though if that were the case, they wouldn't leave loads of .txt files lying around
2014-08-19 23:20:01	@Espyo	but people eventually found out how to zip it... somehow
2014-08-19 23:20:07	@Espyo	I swear, reverse engineers are animals
2014-08-19 23:20:08	@PikFan	maybe it's a gift
2014-08-19 23:20:17	@PikFan	to those who did find out
2014-08-19 23:20:19	@Espyo	basically, you have a zipped file, the .szs
2014-08-19 23:20:23	@Espyo	you open it up to see its numbers
2014-08-19 23:20:25	@Espyo	and it's just... stuff
2014-08-19 23:20:33	@Espyo	you just hope you find a pattern and try to make sense of it
2014-08-19 23:20:37	@Espyo	and get really lucky
2014-08-19 23:20:38	@Espyo	and work really hard
2014-08-19 23:20:43	@J	tar is archiving, gz is compression
2014-08-19 23:20:48	@J	separating the two makes many sense
2014-08-19 23:21:01	@Espyo	I tried messing with Pikmin 2's sequenced music files to see if I could turn them into MIDIS
2014-08-19 23:21:05	@Espyo	I got as far as... nothing
2014-08-19 23:21:12	@Espyo	yeah, loads of sense to have a huge file name
2014-08-19 23:21:19	@Espyo	but yeah, I had a feeling one of them wasn't
2014-08-19 23:21:27	@Espyo	anyway, once people found out how to extract, recompress should be easy
2014-08-19 23:21:29	@Espyo	and... maybe it was
2014-08-19 23:21:30	@PikFan	crud
2014-08-19 23:21:31	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Main_Page
2014-08-19 23:21:44	@Espyo	heck, the people who found out how to decompress and made the tools made the source code available
2014-08-19 23:21:45	@J	heheh
2014-08-19 23:21:51	@Espyo	so with it, you can understand how the files are made
2014-08-19 23:21:59	@Espyo	except... I guess it either had some caveats that took ages to solve
2014-08-19 23:22:05	@Espyo	or nobody TRIED to make a recompressor
2014-08-19 23:22:08	@J	if you want, you can edit that now; it'll get replaced eventually anyway
2014-08-19 23:22:18	@Espyo	ah, the ugly!
2014-08-19 23:22:18	@J	(with the original Pikipedia version)
2014-08-19 23:22:34	@J	I tried to make a compressor once
2014-08-19 23:22:34	@Espyo	but edit conflicts might make your bot explode
2014-08-19 23:22:44	@Espyo	I was ready to embark on a journey to do one
2014-08-19 23:22:44	@J	I got as far as starting the decompressor part
2014-08-19 23:22:48	@Espyo	turns out I never needed it
2014-08-19 23:22:49	@J	then stuff happened
2014-08-19 23:22:56	@Espyo	you're talking about one for .szs, right?
2014-08-19 23:23:00	@J	probably
2014-08-19 23:23:03	@Espyo	hm

2014-08-19 23:23:21	@J	there's a comment in that guy's code to test it by replacing generated files in real games
2014-08-19 23:23:27	@J	maybe you could tell him you did that
2014-08-19 23:23:47	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-08-19 23:23:59	@Espyo	specially Pikmin 2 — this game's file formats are normally different from the rest
2014-08-19 23:24:04	@Espyo	so if it works here, it has to work everywhere
2014-08-19 23:24:09	@Espyo	at least GameCube-wise
2014-08-19 23:24:19	@Espyo	all right, I checked the sequenced music folder
2014-08-19 23:24:25	@Espyo	and there are some pretty small and weird music files
2014-08-19 23:24:30	@Espyo	now I can replace them with existing music
2014-08-19 23:24:33	@Espyo	and hopefully...
2014-08-19 23:24:41	@Espyo	also, there's more unused music in plain stream format
2014-08-19 23:24:46	@Espyo	that was never documented on TCRF
2014-08-19 23:24:50	@Espyo	for one thing, an alternate title screen
2014-08-19 23:24:50	@PikFan	so for the likes of the enemy and sublevel technical templates, you'll be able to figure out what the unknown properties are?
2014-08-19 23:25:00	@Espyo	very likely, yeah
2014-08-19 23:25:06	@Espyo	I can now edit them and see what changes in-game
2014-08-19 23:25:17	@J	well, good luck with that
2014-08-19 23:25:22	@J	it sounds like a lot of work
2014-08-19 23:25:23	@Espyo	yeah, it'll need some work
2014-08-19 23:25:26	@Espyo	but we'll see
2014-08-19 23:25:28	@Espyo	slowly but surely
2014-08-19 23:25:35	@Espyo	plus I'm gonna try to put this everywhere
2014-08-19 23:25:39	@Espyo	so other people can join in on the fun
2014-08-19 23:25:41	@J	and I'm sure you'll discover lots of bugs in my program
2014-08-19 23:25:51	@Espyo	very likely
2014-08-19 23:25:57	@Espyo	you know, it actually behaved pretty darn nicely
2014-08-19 23:26:07	@Espyo	it had info from the last time I ran it, on another PC
2014-08-19 23:26:12	@Espyo	and the recent file list was outdated
2014-08-19 23:26:15	@Espyo	so it pointed to a non-existing file
2014-08-19 23:26:24	@Espyo	it gave a warning without crashing like a champ
2014-08-19 23:26:44	@J	hmm, it seems I never made {{merging subpage}}

2014-08-19 23:26:58	@PikFan	right now, anyway

2014-08-19 23:28:06	@J	whoever can be bothered, create that template
2014-08-19 23:28:09	@PikFan	might wanna head over to TCRF and tell them about it

2014-08-19 23:28:59	@J	very
2014-08-19 23:29:07	@Espyo	I told you at the time
2014-08-19 23:29:09	@PikFan	hehehehe
2014-08-19 23:29:13	@Espyo	you were probably busy with who knows what
2014-08-19 23:29:17	@Espyo	PikFan: yeah, will do
2014-08-19 23:29:38	@PikFan	15:26	PikFan	so we're the only ones who know how to do this?
2014-08-19 23:29:58	@J	okay, moved it
2014-08-19 23:30:02	@Espyo	don't remember you saying it
2014-08-19 23:30:05	@J	[23:29:07] @Espyo I told you at the time
2014-08-19 23:30:14	@J	you noticed and didn't bother correcting it?
2014-08-19 23:30:23	@J	you probably just wanted to call me silly again
2014-08-19 23:30:27	@Espyo	I don't know what goes on in your twisted mind!
2014-08-19 23:30:31	@Espyo	you probably WANTED it as a page
2014-08-19 23:30:34	@J	...
2014-08-19 23:30:42	@Espyo	provided nobody else got the idea of finding tools on the internet to do what I did... I'm the only person who knows how to do this
2014-08-19 23:30:51	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-19 23:30:55	@Espyo	although, I once saw a video from... pidi64, was it? in which he changed the models of a cave
2014-08-19 23:30:57	@PikFan	or we could be evil and keep it all to ourselves
2014-08-19 23:31:02	@Espyo	and I'm very sure that requires editing .szs and .rarc
2014-08-19 23:31:05	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-08-19 23:31:13	@Espyo	but of course not
2014-08-19 23:31:25	@PikFan	yes, of course
2014-08-19 23:31:30	@Espyo	J: how would I... send a message to the guy on Github?
2014-08-19 23:32:03	@Espyo	PikFan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER_E6ywCyQ
2014-08-19 23:32:07	@Espyo	dunno how he did it
2014-08-19 23:32:16	@Espyo	unless that's a model inside the game, he added a new model
2014-08-19 23:32:27	@PikFan	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZaqCYQpAu0
2014-08-19 23:32:31	@Espyo	and I know how to access the models that make up caves [[Cave units]]

2014-08-19 23:32:40	@J	I...do not know
2014-08-19 23:32:42	@Espyo	but editing them... I can't remember, but I'm sure you need to repack .szs and .rarc
2014-08-19 23:32:49	@Espyo	you do not know what
2014-08-19 23:32:51	@Espyo	oh
2014-08-19 23:33:11	@Espyo	PikFan: editing textures PROBABLY needs .rarc and .szs editing too

2014-08-19 23:33:36	@PikFan	...I was hoping we'd be the first
2014-08-19 23:33:38	@Espyo	>In this video I changed text, parameter, texure data .
2014-08-19 23:33:39	@Espyo	For example I used A3 63 A3 63 as color commands !
2014-08-19 23:33:41	@PikFan	but oh well
2014-08-19 23:33:45	@Espyo	err, maybe he never edited the textures
2014-08-19 23:33:49	@Espyo	just some color control values

2014-08-19 23:33:59	@Espyo	never got a reply from this
2014-08-19 23:34:06	@Espyo	he created his own forum, doesn't even bother to read it
2014-08-19 23:34:11	@Espyo	unsurprisingly, it's a stupid old forum
2014-08-19 23:36:55	@J	okay, it's time for me to go
2014-08-19 23:37:04	@Espyo	same here, soon
2014-08-19 23:37:11	@PikFan	night
2014-08-19 23:37:13	@J	if the script goes out of control...there's nothing you can do about it, so don't panic
2014-08-19 23:37:13	@Espyo	you'll leave it running, then?
2014-08-19 23:37:19	@J	yep
2014-08-19 23:37:23	@Espyo	I'll try to see if I don't die of heart attack tomorrow
2014-08-19 23:37:34	@Espyo	make sure the computer doesn't enter suspend mode or something
2014-08-19 23:37:40	@Espyo	oh, that's a windows problem
2014-08-19 23:37:46	@J	I think lots of imports failed, so I may need to run it again on those
2014-08-19 23:37:47	@Espyo	where suspend is less "suspend" and more "enter a coma"
2014-08-19 23:37:51	@J	timeouts or something
2014-08-19 23:37:54	@Espyo	crud
2014-08-19 23:38:05	@J	anyway, bye

2014-08-19 23:38:53	@PikFan	bye
2014-08-19 23:42:55	@PikFan	woah look at this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F8xemEkS_w
2014-08-19 23:45:54	@PikFan	wait, do you think it's possible to make it so that there's more than 100 Pikmin in your group?
2014-08-19 23:46:07	@PikFan	*-wait
2014-08-19 23:53:13	@PikFan	outside, bye
2014-08-19 23:55:08	@Espyo	nope
2014-08-19 23:55:19	@Espyo	the game is /REALLY/ persistent about that
2014-08-19 23:55:21	@Espyo	robust too
2014-08-19 23:55:31	@Espyo	anything you try to add over 100 will just make the new Pikmin not spawn
2014-08-19 23:55:44	@Espyo	like, the way you can make yourself start with X carrot Pikmin in Challenge Mode
2014-08-19 23:56:04	@Espyo	you could just make yourself start with 100 Reds, 100 Yellows, 100 B, 100 P, 100 W, 100 Bulbmin and 100 carrots
2014-08-19 23:56:09	@Espyo	...but you'd only get 100 Reds
2014-08-19 23:56:13	@Espyo	the game cuts the rest off
2014-08-19 23:56:18	@Espyo	I suppose it does this because of the in-game Bulbmin
2014-08-19 23:56:31	@Espyo	if you have like 98 Pikmin with you, it tries to spawn 10 Bublmin, but ignores the last 8
2014-08-19 23:57:56	@PikFan	huh, weird
2014-08-19 23:58:04	@PikFan	came back in because I forgot something
2014-08-19 23:58:31	@PikFan	so you can't edit the files to let the game spawn more than 100 Pikmin?
2014-08-19 23:59:28	@Espyo	nope
2014-08-19 23:59:32	@Espyo	at least not as far as anybody knows
2014-08-19 23:59:39	@Espyo	there is probably a number, "100", somewhere
2014-08-19 23:59:47	@Espyo	and changing that would change the limit
2014-08-19 23:59:51	@Espyo	but chances are this is in the code
2014-08-19 23:59:57	@Espyo	not on a config file
2014-08-20 00:00:09	@PikFan	code?
2014-08-20 00:00:14	@PikFan	what code?
2014-08-20 00:00:25	@Espyo	although you have the craziest of things in config files, like the starting and ending hour for a day
2014-08-20 00:00:30	@Espyo	so maybe it's in a config file
2014-08-20 00:00:36	@Espyo	although we already checked all known config files...
2014-08-20 00:00:38	@Espyo	the game's code
2014-08-20 00:00:43	@Espyo	there are resources, and there are code
2014-08-20 00:00:46	@Espyo	code is... the logic, really
2014-08-20 00:00:56	@Espyo	resources are images, sounds, data files, etc.
2014-08-20 00:01:08	@Espyo	on the engine, the code is compiled to create the .exe
2014-08-20 00:01:14	@Espyo	that's what you could kinda call the "code" of the game
2014-08-20 00:01:24	@Espyo	everything in Game_data is the resources the engine loads to create a valid game
2014-08-20 00:01:39	@Espyo	in my case, the limit of Pikmin is stored on a resource — a text file with loads of configs
2014-08-20 00:01:43	@Espyo	(it's not yet, but it will be)
2014-08-20 00:01:51	@Espyo	but in the case of Pikmin 2, it's not in any known config file
2014-08-20 00:01:57	@Espyo	so it might just be in the actual game "logic"
2014-08-20 00:02:12	@PikFan	is it possible to do anything with the "logic"?
2014-08-20 00:03:45	@Espyo	well
2014-08-20 00:03:47	@Espyo	the game's there
2014-08-20 00:03:50	@Espyo	and the game's changeable
2014-08-20 00:04:03	@Espyo	except we have finesse when we change the files
2014-08-20 00:04:10	@Espyo	in that we grab files, carefully edit them, and put them back in
2014-08-20 00:04:17	@Espyo	like replacing an organ on a surgery
2014-08-20 00:04:20	@Espyo	the logic is the brain
2014-08-20 00:04:24	@Espyo	and the only tool we have is a hammer
2014-08-20 00:04:35	@Espyo	we can't disassemble the brain unless we're master hackers
2014-08-20 00:04:44	@Espyo	...so the best we can do is hit the logic until we strike the number
2014-08-20 00:04:55	@Espyo	...and VERY likely destroy everything in our path and make the game not work
2014-08-20 00:05:12	@Espyo	we can use a tool to access the RAW data of the entire ISO (because we don't know the real "place" the logic is at)
2014-08-20 00:05:16	@Espyo	and from there...
2014-08-20 00:05:26	@Espyo	just... try to replace everything that's worth "100"
2014-08-20 00:05:38	@Espyo	...problem is a game as big as P2 probably has hundreds of instances where "100" appears
2014-08-20 00:05:44	@Espyo	so we'll likely break loads of things
2014-08-20 00:05:58	@Espyo	but implying there's enough patience, it's possible in theory to find the number inside the logic and change it
2014-08-20 00:06:03	@PikFan	seeing as you just discovered how to rezip files, do you think it might be possible to edit the logic eventually?
2014-08-20 00:06:06	@Espyo	that is... assuming Pikmin 2 DOES have a limit number
2014-08-20 00:06:17	@Espyo	and it doesn't count the Pikmin one by one in some weird algorithm
2014-08-20 00:06:22	@Espyo	of COURSE it uses a number... it has to
2014-08-20 00:06:29	@Espyo	not really
2014-08-20 00:06:43	@Espyo	the closest we can do is use Dolphin to actually peak into the brain activity
2014-08-20 00:06:47	@Espyo	and understand what it's doing
2014-08-20 00:06:55	@Espyo	and maybe then we could pinpoint where and what to edit
2014-08-20 00:07:11	@Espyo	except, of course, when you own the code (me on the engine, Nintendo on Pikmin 2), everything's written in nice codey English
2014-08-20 00:07:12	@PikFan	ah, so you CAN edit it
2014-08-20 00:07:22	@Espyo	here, the best thing you can do is read... machine language
2014-08-20 00:07:32	@Espyo	you can, but I wouldn't see it coming any time soon
2014-08-20 00:07:42	@Espyo	if Pikmin 2 were an important thing in life, like a human body, then yes, definitely
2014-08-20 00:07:47	@Espyo	it's not an incredible task
2014-08-20 00:07:56	@Espyo	but given that Pikmin 2's popularity is lowering each time more
2014-08-20 00:08:04	@Espyo	nobody would really search out to find out how to change the value
2014-08-20 00:08:17	@Espyo	at best, I'd do it with my limited abilities and skills at the stuff involved
2014-08-20 00:08:20	@PikFan	technology is becoming more advanced
2014-08-20 00:08:26	@Espyo	but then I'd just be tiring myself out
2014-08-20 00:08:29	@PikFan	it'll be possible someday
2014-08-20 00:08:38	@Espyo	yeah, it is, but that also means the Dolphin developers have to keep working on it
2014-08-20 00:08:46	@Espyo	and the people who make tools to help read other things inside games, and specially Pikmin 2
2014-08-20 00:08:55	@Espyo	otherwise, who cares if we're all geniuses if Pikmin 2 is buried and dead
2014-08-20 00:09:47	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-20 00:09:56	@PikFan	now I'm going outside
2014-08-20 00:09:57	@PikFan	bye
2014-08-20 00:09:58	@Espyo	but yeah, long story short, there's no quick way to change the limit, like we change other content in Pikmin 2, because it must be inside the logic, the way the game thinks
2014-08-20 00:10:06	@Espyo	and we have no technology to edit that EASILY at the moment
2014-08-20 00:10:10	@Espyo	Action Replay codes change the logic
2014-08-20 00:10:14	@Espyo	some can make your Pikmin giant
2014-08-20 00:10:28	@Espyo	others force the game to load a different area (test areas), like hypnosis
2014-08-20 00:10:37	@Espyo	but something like the limit... eh, might be easy, but nobody has found it yet
2014-08-20 00:10:44	@Espyo	bed time

2014-08-20 22:14:46	@Espyo	all right, this will work
2014-08-20 22:14:52	@Espyo	is this an unused song, yes or no?
2014-08-20 22:14:54	@Espyo	we'll find out shortly
2014-08-20 22:15:42	@Espyo	...and the result is silence
2014-08-20 22:15:46	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-20 22:23:37	@Espyo	hm, the game doesn't handle music changes all that well
2014-08-20 22:23:54	@Espyo	ok, so at first I tried replacing a known sequenced music file (music after you get a key in Challenge Mode) with an unused file
2014-08-20 22:23:56	@Espyo	I got silence
2014-08-20 22:24:07	@Espyo	then I tried switching it with a normal song, the 2-player battle theme
2014-08-20 22:24:12	@Espyo	...this is where it got weird
2014-08-20 22:24:21	@Espyo	still silence, EXCEPT when I told Pikmin to start carrying something
2014-08-20 22:24:40	@Espyo	then, I heard some exotic drums for a bit, then they faded away
2014-08-20 22:24:46	@Espyo	I told them to carry another item, and they returned
2014-08-20 22:24:50	@Espyo	but they always went away after some seconds
2014-08-20 22:25:02	@Espyo	if the Pikmin are told to continuously begin carrying a treasure, I hear it again
2014-08-20 22:25:13	@Espyo	this all means it's mapping the wrong instruments to the variations
2014-08-20 22:25:18	@Espyo	but... why doesn't everything else play?
2014-08-20 22:27:15	@J	okay, just 50 pages left
2014-08-20 22:28:01	@J	maybe the music file doesn't state what sounds it uses
2014-08-20 22:28:11	@J	and you have to switch out that too, or something
2014-08-20 22:28:34	@J	oh, you just said that
2014-08-20 22:28:41	@J	missing instruments?
2014-08-20 22:28:56	@J	some sets are smaller than others and it's going past the end?
2014-08-20 22:29:08	@Espyo	not quite
2014-08-20 22:29:29	@Espyo	more like the key theme has like 8 tracks, and the 2-player theme has like 6
2014-08-20 22:29:46	@Espyo	and the game is told to change the volume of track, say, 4, when an object's being carried
2014-08-20 22:29:55	@Espyo	it doesn't QUITE add up because the key theme never changes
2014-08-20 22:29:59	@Espyo	but maybe it was meant t
2014-08-20 22:30:00	@Espyo	*to
2014-08-20 22:30:14	@Espyo	hmm, and the game should still play the other tracks fine
2014-08-20 22:30:19	@Espyo	so... I'm not sure what's up
2014-08-20 22:33:47	@J	because they're using instruments by IDs that don't even exist in the set it's trying to use
2014-08-20 22:36:52	@Espyo	ah, that likely makes sense
2014-08-20 22:36:59	@Espyo	I was thinking in a way more broad MIDI sense
2014-08-20 22:37:04	@Espyo	and in a more free sense
2014-08-20 22:37:19	@Espyo	I mean, now that you say that, I realize that yeah, the game doesn't have to load instruments the song doesn't use
2014-08-20 22:37:33	@Espyo	which means the list of instruments is somewhere else
2014-08-20 22:40:29	@J	I think these files are too large to import
2014-08-20 22:40:38	@Espyo	woah, drat
2014-08-20 22:40:41	@J	I tried changing the number of pages per import, but some are still too large
2014-08-20 22:40:51	@J	I'll try sending one to you, and you can try with special:import
2014-08-20 22:41:34	@Espyo	okay
2014-08-20 22:41:51	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/import.tar.xz
2014-08-20 22:43:07	@Espyo	wait, I can try /what/ with Special:Import?
2014-08-20 22:43:14	@Espyo	oh
2014-08-20 22:43:17	@Espyo	that's an xm
2014-08-20 22:43:18	@Espyo	*xml
2014-08-20 22:43:20	@Espyo	thought it wasn't
2014-08-20 22:43:24	@J	yeah
2014-08-20 22:43:32	@J	should be 11MiB extracted
2014-08-20 22:43:56	@Espyo	that checks out
2014-08-20 22:44:02	@Espyo	uh... huh
2014-08-20 22:44:09	@Espyo	import failed, lost session data
2014-08-20 22:44:21	@J	that was quick, though
2014-08-20 22:44:24	@J	mine takes minutes
2014-08-20 22:44:26	@Espyo	really was
2014-08-20 22:44:35	@Espyo	my upload speed is... uh, I think it should be 10 mbps
2014-08-20 22:46:06	@J	okay, looks like the cutoff is around 10MiB
2014-08-20 22:46:18	@Espyo	drat
2014-08-20 22:46:30	@J	I guess the only thing to do is reduce the number per file to even less
2014-08-20 22:47:57	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-20 22:48:24	@J	so, for some reason uploading these files via the API gives a token error
2014-08-20 22:48:38	@J	so maybe you that's what you were seeing
2014-08-20 22:48:42	@J	and you had larger files?
2014-08-20 22:48:55	@Espyo	I probably did
2014-08-20 22:49:07	@Espyo	can't remember which one it was trying
2014-08-20 22:49:10	@Espyo	hm, might've been the first
2014-08-20 22:49:26	@Espyo	 12 MB
2014-08-20 22:49:37	@Espyo	the next one is 13, the other 14, and after that it's under 10 for a while, and then...
2014-08-20 22:49:42	@Espyo	well, yeah, 12 > 10
2014-08-20 22:50:23	@J	the one it chose is probably random
2014-08-20 22:50:34	@Espyo	that makes no sense
2014-08-20 22:50:42	@J	why?
2014-08-20 22:50:48	@Espyo	why is my question!
2014-08-20 22:50:50	@Espyo	why'd it pick random?
2014-08-20 22:51:01	@Espyo	plus, I... am pretty sure I saw it always said it was using 0
2014-08-20 22:51:09	@J	maybe
2014-08-20 22:51:35	@J	I just didn't order them, so it's probably whatever order Windows's directory listing syscall gives
2014-08-20 22:52:15	@Espyo	why should that order be random?
2014-08-20 22:52:18	@Espyo	and yeah, in that case, 0
2014-08-20 22:52:36	@J	because there's no reason to order it
2014-08-20 22:52:56	@J	so it's just whatever order the files are in in the filesystem tree
2014-08-20 22:53:24	@Espyo	right, I remember now
2014-08-20 22:53:31	@Espyo	I did peek into the code, and it pretty much gathers the first one
2014-08-20 22:53:40	@Espyo	but... in pretty much every OS, at least the 0 is first
2014-08-20 22:53:51	@Espyo	in windows, it's along the lines of 0, 1, 10, 11, 12, ...
2014-08-20 22:54:02	@J	depends what program you're using
2014-08-20 22:54:10	@J	the file manager obviously sorts the files after listing them
2014-08-20 22:54:16	@J	so will command-line tools
2014-08-20 22:54:29	@J	but, for example, 'ls' has an option not to do any sorting
2014-08-20 22:54:30	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-08-20 22:54:35	@Espyo	oh, I see
2014-08-20 22:54:38	@J	which gives you an apparently random order
2014-08-20 22:54:42	@J	but it's always the same order
2014-08-20 22:54:47	@Espyo	I was under the idea that when you ask the OS for a directory, it always sorts
2014-08-20 22:54:53	@Espyo	which... wouldn't make sense in retrospect
2014-08-20 22:55:07	@Espyo	probably order on the... uh, that table
2014-08-20 22:55:11	@Espyo	the filesystem table
2014-08-20 22:55:13	@Espyo	or whatever it's called
2014-08-20 23:03:33	@Espyo	well, I'm not any closer to make the game load these songs
2014-08-20 23:03:36	@Espyo	they have to be unused
2014-08-20 23:03:42	@Espyo	because whereas most songs are 2KB
2014-08-20 23:03:49	@Espyo	these one are under 1KB
2014-08-20 23:03:55	@Espyo	and they're named after existing stream songs

2014-08-20 23:10:41	@J	the only way around it is to export revisions separately, I think
2014-08-20 23:10:41	@Espyo	let's try the opposite
2014-08-20 23:10:46	@J	which could be really annoying
2014-08-20 23:10:51	@Espyo	not the good kind of "badly" either — it just froze
2014-08-20 23:11:05	@J	...for a minute there I thought you meant my stuff
2014-08-20 23:11:11	@Espyo	hey, it didn't froze with Piklopedia on Wistful Wild
2014-08-20 23:11:13	@J	that I replaced the wrong article
2014-08-20 23:11:19	@Espyo	it's all silent, but the drums are here... slower than normal
2014-08-20 23:11:27	@Espyo	probably very annoying
2014-08-20 23:11:31	@Espyo	to replace manually
2014-08-20 23:12:12	@Espyo	oh hey, I heard a guitar now
2014-08-20 23:13:46	@Espyo	so that's all I hear...
2014-08-20 23:13:52	@Espyo	the drumset and the guitar
2014-08-20 23:14:07	@Espyo	I REALLY wanted to see if I could convert these bms into midi
2014-08-20 23:14:30	@Espyo	it's obvious the game's not having any of it
2014-08-20 23:14:36	@Espyo	it really doesn't want people switching music files

2014-08-20 23:21:37	@PikFan	hi
2014-08-20 23:21:41	@J	okay, everything but Pikmin family got imported
2014-08-20 23:21:48	@J	it's just doing the edits
2014-08-20 23:22:07	@J	I think some edits may have been missed; I'll run some checks tomorrow
2014-08-20 23:22:54	@J	and it's finished
2014-08-20 23:23:02	@J	hi PikFan 
2014-08-20 23:23:06	@J	and with that, I should go
2014-08-20 23:23:06	@J	bye
2014-08-20 23:23:28	@PikFan	bye
2014-08-20 23:23:48	@PikFan	Espyo: "as it will well be worth the wait!"
2014-08-20 23:24:03	@PikFan	shouldn't it be "as it will be well worth the wait!"?
2014-08-20 23:24:36	@Espyo	same thing, no?
2014-08-20 23:24:44	@Espyo	bye J
2014-08-20 23:24:54	@Espyo	meanwhile, I'm trying to see if I can find stuff about Pikmin 2's sequenced music
2014-08-20 23:25:03	@Espyo	I can't replace the likes of 2-player theme with Piklopedia
2014-08-20 23:25:06	@Espyo	the game is REALLY picky about it
2014-08-20 23:25:15	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-20 23:25:16	@Espyo	like, I tried putting the Piklopedia theme on the WW
2014-08-20 23:25:29	@Espyo	I could only hear the drums and the guitar that plays for 3 seconds midway through
2014-08-20 23:25:48	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-20 23:26:03	@PikFan	"will well be" vs "will be well"
2014-08-20 23:27:09	@Espyo	I'll try asking around
2014-08-20 23:27:52	@PikFan	fair enough
2014-08-20 23:28:06	@PikFan	we have bigger fish to fry, though
2014-08-20 23:28:09	@Espyo	mhm
2014-08-20 23:28:21	@Espyo	"will be well" says one person
2014-08-20 23:28:47	@Espyo	two votes for "will be well"
2014-08-20 23:29:08	@PikFan	sorry, just my grammatical OCD kicking in
2014-08-20 23:29:57	@Espyo	it's fine
2014-08-20 23:30:09	@Espyo	right now I'm trying to break the sequenced music files
2014-08-20 23:30:11	@Espyo	to see what changes
2014-08-20 23:30:19	@Espyo	hopefully that'll get me closer to understanding the format
2014-08-20 23:30:26	@PikFan	mm
2014-08-20 23:30:30	@Espyo	and then we could...
2014-08-20 23:30:40	@Espyo	well, not add our own music, because the game hates having its music tampered with
2014-08-20 23:30:47	@Espyo	but we could at least listen to it outside of the game
2014-08-20 23:30:52	@Espyo	...just not with the official instruments
2014-08-20 23:31:03	@Espyo	will this break...?
2014-08-20 23:31:05	@Espyo	it broke
2014-08-20 23:31:10	@Espyo	it REALLY hates being tampered with
2014-08-20 23:31:12	@Espyo	oh!
2014-08-20 23:31:13	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-20 23:31:15	@Espyo	it didn't!
2014-08-20 23:31:22	@PikFan	oh
2014-08-20 23:31:27	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-20 23:31:29	@PikFan	the more you know
2014-08-20 23:31:33	@Espyo	ok, so from my understanding
2014-08-20 23:31:41	@Espyo	this has several tracks — each track is an instrument
2014-08-20 23:31:49	@Espyo	there's the banjo, the strings, the trumpets, etc.
2014-08-20 23:31:59	@Espyo	I told the file to change all settings of the drums track
2014-08-20 23:32:04	@Espyo	and... dummy the other tracks, basically
2014-08-20 23:32:06	@Espyo	and it must've worked
2014-08-20 23:32:38	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-20 23:32:53	@PikFan	well, Pikmin 2 does have a rather complicated music system
2014-08-20 23:33:14	@PikFan	it's unsurprising that it doesn't like its music being messed with
2014-08-20 23:34:13	@Espyo	mhm
2014-08-20 23:34:28	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-20 23:34:35	@Espyo	I changed to a different track, but it's still drums
2014-08-20 23:34:50	@Espyo	aaaand the unmarked spectralids are trapped on he Bulborb's butt
2014-08-20 23:34:51	@Espyo	pfft
2014-08-20 23:35:05	@Espyo	I'd zoom in to take a screenshot, but then I'd wake it up with a carrot
2014-08-20 23:35:25	@PikFan	lol
2014-08-20 23:39:18	@Espyo	well, stuff is happening
2014-08-20 23:39:24	@Espyo	I can enable and disable instruments
2014-08-20 23:39:46	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-20 23:40:33	@Espyo	takes forever to reach the Piklopedia
2014-08-20 23:40:40	@Espyo	some things, I can hold a key down to speed the emulator up
2014-08-20 23:40:47	@Espyo	like the 50/60hz menu
2014-08-20 23:40:57	@Espyo	but stuff like the title screen runs slowly on my machine
2014-08-20 23:41:21	@Espyo	so I end up taking pretty much the same time as if I were to reach the Piklopedia from a normal GC
2014-08-20 23:42:13	@PikFan	GC?
2014-08-20 23:42:22	@PikFan	...oh, GameCube
2014-08-20 23:42:33	@PikFan	was thinking Golden Cookie, heh
2014-08-20 23:42:51	@Espyo	heh
2014-08-20 23:42:54	@Espyo	what the hell am I hearing
2014-08-20 23:43:04	@Espyo	I missed with what I shouldn't have
2014-08-20 23:43:08	@Espyo	and now I'm hearing weird noises
2014-08-20 23:44:04	@PikFan	what kinds of weird noises?
2014-08-20 23:44:16	@PikFan	these might be important for later
2014-08-20 23:45:28	@Espyo	just electronic
2014-08-20 23:45:37	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-20 23:45:40	@Espyo	they can't be in-game SFX because I stripped the game out of all of them
2014-08-20 23:45:47	@Espyo	...kind of by accident
2014-08-20 23:46:45	@PikFan	"This suggests Koppai (and maybe Hocotate) could be situated in one of the many "Mini Galaxies" clustered around the outside rim of the Milky Way Galaxy."
2014-08-20 23:46:49	@PikFan	...uh
2014-08-20 23:47:04	@PikFan	the correct term is satellite galaxy
2014-08-20 23:47:08	@Espyo	where's that?
2014-08-20 23:47:17	@PikFan	[[Koppai/merge]]
2014-08-20 23:47:18	Testyo	"Koppai/merge" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Koppai/merge
2014-08-20 23:47:29	@Espyo	hm
2014-08-20 23:50:33	@Espyo	WHAT?!
2014-08-20 23:50:43	@PikFan	?
2014-08-20 23:50:49	@Espyo	ok, I think I found the song speed, except a higher value makes it go /slower/
2014-08-20 23:50:53	@Espyo	it's normally the other way around
2014-08-20 23:50:54	@Espyo	BUT
2014-08-20 23:50:56	@Espyo	THAT'S NOT IT
2014-08-20 23:50:58	@PikFan	...
2014-08-20 23:51:00	@Espyo	I open the Piklopedia
2014-08-20 23:51:06	@Espyo	and the spectralids go APESHIT
2014-08-20 23:51:15	@Espyo	they pushed the Bulborb a good quarter of the area
2014-08-20 23:51:19	@Espyo	area = WW
2014-08-20 23:51:22	@PikFan	...
2014-08-20 23:51:24	@PikFan	whaaaaaaaaaaaat
2014-08-20 23:51:32	@PikFan	amazing
2014-08-20 23:51:39	@Espyo	it fell off of its designated place
2014-08-20 23:51:48	@Espyo	that was... probably unique
2014-08-20 23:51:49	@Espyo	not happening again
2014-08-20 23:51:55	@Espyo	it's not because of the music
2014-08-20 23:52:09	@Espyo	maybe some spawned inside of it and pushed it for ages
2014-08-20 23:52:48	@Espyo	well, that's a thing to do if you're bored and have time
2014-08-20 23:53:00	@Espyo	open the Red Bulborb file over and over until it gets dragged for miles
2014-08-20 23:53:42	@PikFan	speaking of weird stuff with the Piklopedia
2014-08-20 23:53:57	@PikFan	one time a while back, I was throwing the pikpik carrots
2014-08-20 23:54:01	@Espyo	well, I lost my ears just now
2014-08-20 23:54:05	@Espyo	a higher value made it slow
2014-08-20 23:54:08	@PikFan	and they didn't explode in the water
2014-08-20 23:54:08	@Espyo	so I tried a lower value
2014-08-20 23:54:20	@Espyo	which, by making all sense, TURNED THE MUSIC INTO A LOUD SCREECH
2014-08-20 23:54:28	@Espyo	oh, that's weid
2014-08-20 23:54:29	@PikFan	hah
2014-08-20 23:54:30	@Espyo	*weird
2014-08-20 23:54:34	@Espyo	and useful for water enemies
2014-08-20 23:54:49	@PikFan	I could never reproduce it, though
2014-08-20 23:54:56	@PikFan	but it was really weird
2014-08-20 23:55:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-20 23:56:16	@Espyo	yep, game being picky again
2014-08-20 23:56:20	@Espyo	I changed the value by just 1
2014-08-20 23:56:24	@Espyo	and it went into slow mode again
2014-08-20 23:57:47	@Espyo	going to bed now
2014-08-20 23:57:53	@Espyo	I'll try continuing some other time
2014-08-20 23:58:09	@PikFan	heh, alright
2014-08-20 23:58:18	@PikFan	let your brain reconfigure itself
2014-08-20 23:58:23	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-08-20 23:58:25	@Espyo	night

2014-08-21 22:59:20	@Espyo	hi
2014-08-21 23:03:57	@J	?
2014-08-21 23:04:40	@PikFan	hi J
2014-08-21 23:04:46	@J	hi
2014-08-21 23:05:20	@Espyo	uh...
2014-08-21 23:05:21	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2014-08-21 23:05:34	@Espyo	is there any way to add command line arguments in Python code?
2014-08-21 23:05:41	@J	add?
2014-08-21 23:07:07	@Espyo	you know, I want the .szs extractor to open a file given from the command line arguments
2014-08-21 23:07:11	@J	oh, you want the yaz-
2014-08-21 23:07:11	@J	yeah
2014-08-21 23:07:15	@J	I just realised
2014-08-21 23:07:17	@Espyo	mhm
2014-08-21 23:07:21	@Espyo	took me a bit to type — was busy
2014-08-21 23:07:28	@J	import sys; sys.argv[1:]
2014-08-21 23:07:37	@J	([0] is the executable path)
2014-08-21 23:07:45	@Espyo	perfect
2014-08-21 23:08:59	@Espyo	sys.argv[1:] would be just the first argument?
2014-08-21 23:10:15	@J	no, it's all of them
2014-08-21 23:10:22	@J	[1] is the first
2014-08-21 23:10:37	@J	that will throw if there are no arguments, but [1:] won't
2014-08-21 23:11:29	@Espyo	thought so
2014-08-21 23:13:12	@Espyo	what about making it optional?
2014-08-21 23:13:23	@Espyo	like, if the argument is present, use it, if not, use some default value
2014-08-21 23:14:28	@J	check length: len(sys.argv)
2014-08-21 23:15:04	@Espyo	simple enough
2014-08-21 23:19:42	@J	though, thinking about it, I would probably make all arguments files to compress, and it just outputs to the same filename with '.szs' appended (unless that file exists)
2014-08-21 23:20:04	@J	that's what xz does
2014-08-21 23:20:32	@J	gzip too
2014-08-21 23:20:34	@Espyo	probably
2014-08-21 23:20:42	@Espyo	uh, how would I turn a string to an int?
2014-08-21 23:21:06	@J	int(the_string)
2014-08-21 23:21:13	@Espyo	all right
2014-08-21 23:21:16	@J	it throws if it's not an int
2014-08-21 23:21:29	@J	unlike JavaScript...
2014-08-21 23:21:39	@Espyo	all right, this can't crash, surely
2014-08-21 23:21:40	@Espyo	thanks
2014-08-21 23:21:53	@Espyo	*if it's not a string?
2014-08-21 23:21:57	@J	mm
2014-08-21 23:22:12	@J	I meant, if it is a string, but the contents of the string isn't a valid integer expression
2014-08-21 23:22:17	@J	even if it's a float like 1.0
2014-08-21 23:22:25	@Espyo	oh, I see
2014-08-21 23:22:45	@Espyo	actually, I'd rather make this one editable inside the .py
2014-08-21 23:22:48	@Espyo	instead of an argument
2014-08-21 23:22:51	@Espyo	probably less stressing
2014-08-21 23:22:54	@Espyo	it's just the compression level
2014-08-21 23:23:01	@J	hmm, yeah
2014-08-21 23:23:20	@J	if you want to do it properly, argparse is in the standard library
2014-08-21 23:23:27	@J	though it takes a bit of work to get anything
2014-08-21 23:23:41	@J	it gives you options like '-c <level>' or something
2014-08-21 23:24:15	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-21 23:38:00	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-08-21 23:38:10	@Espyo	I'd like the extractor to create a file with the same name, but .rarc extension
2014-08-21 23:39:39	@Espyo	I could probably hack it and do like sys.argv[1][:-3] + ".rarc", right?
2014-08-21 23:39:45	@Espyo	assuming the input's always a .szs
2014-08-21 23:41:23	@Espyo	well, tomorrow, gotta go to bed
2014-08-21 23:41:41	@J	import os; os.path.splitext(path)[0]

2014-08-23 19:03:17	@Espyo	it's only gonna end up making things more messy
2014-08-23 19:03:17	@PikFan	yeah, they're calling it "Operation Baldy Long Legs"
2014-08-23 19:03:25	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-23 19:03:40	@PikFan	it's only a matter of time before wikia notices
2014-08-23 19:04:25	@Espyo	luckily, there's not much they can do
2014-08-23 19:04:27	@Espyo	what, ban the admins?
2014-08-23 19:04:32	@Espyo	yeah, and only prove our point further

2014-08-23 19:04:44	@Espyo	nobody else will remain on wikia, that's final
2014-08-23 19:04:51	@Espyo	chances are they might not care so much this time around
2014-08-23 19:04:56	@Espyo	if it were a big wiki, they'd fight for it
2014-08-23 19:05:02	@Espyo	well, it is big, but not Simpsons big
2014-08-23 19:05:15	@PikFan	like I said in my forum post, some will prefer wikia
2014-08-23 19:05:23	@PikFan	almost typed blog post, haha
2014-08-23 19:05:27	@Espyo	heh
2014-08-23 19:05:33	@Espyo	well, it's their choice if they want to go to the inferior place
2014-08-23 19:05:36	@Espyo	and be marked as traitors
2014-08-23 19:06:38	@PikFan	"But last time I really spent time on there, things were so out of date (it was around the time of the Pikmin 3 hype)."
2014-08-23 19:06:56	@Espyo	duh
2014-08-23 19:06:59	@PikFan	that's because there was only one semi-active editor who was adding content
2014-08-23 19:07:13	@PikFan	which was because of the split
2014-08-23 19:08:00	@PikFan	also, this: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Featured_image&curid=1851&diff=137333&oldid=137329
2014-08-23 19:08:32	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure that when you have a game name or something in italicized text, you don't italicize it
2014-08-23 19:08:50	@Espyo	we did it before
2014-08-23 19:09:00	@Espyo	if I could remember an example...
2014-08-23 19:09:13	@PikFan	ah, that must be why I'm thinking it
2014-08-23 19:09:16	@Espyo	but yeah, if regular text is italicized, game names come in neutral form
2014-08-23 19:09:40	@PikFan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type#Italics_within_italics
2014-08-23 19:09:49	@PikFan	"If something within a run of italics needs to be italicized itself, the type is normally switched back to non-italicized (roman) type"
2014-08-23 19:10:08	@Espyo	yup
2014-08-23 19:10:25	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-23 19:10:28	@Espyo	...kind of weird calling it roman vs italic
2014-08-23 19:10:32	@Espyo	because Rome is in Italy
2014-08-23 19:10:44	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-23 19:11:28	@PikFan	so going by that, how come we italicize a publication anyway?
2014-08-23 19:11:37	@Espyo	style
2014-08-23 19:12:03	@PikFan	can you be more specific?
2014-08-23 19:12:23	@Espyo	well, it's to make everything not look bland and the same
2014-08-23 19:12:33	@Espyo	plus this isn't really article body, it's more like a special box
2014-08-23 19:12:39	@Espyo	so it's better off looking special
2014-08-23 19:12:54	@PikFan	oh, I see

2014-08-23 19:16:49	@Espyo	remember to explain why
2014-08-23 19:16:53	@Espyo	also, greet the user and ask them
2014-08-23 19:16:57	@Espyo	or rather

2014-08-23 23:31:47	@PikFan	nice
2014-08-23 23:31:53	@PikFan	did you hear about the merge?
2014-08-23 23:34:00	ZoltCat	yes. I always felt that that'll be a good idea because pikiapeda had info closer to the truth wheres pikmin wiki had MORE info but most of it was false 
2014-08-23 23:34:24	@PikFan	it isn't false
2014-08-23 23:34:33	@PikFan	just that it's not of the greatest quality
2014-08-23 23:35:08	ZoltCat	well.... it was being changed alot so i never knew if it was true or not.
2014-08-23 23:36:08	ZoltCat	also will the new website be run by wikia? cus that website slows my internet down ALOT
2014-08-23 23:36:33	@Espyo	hah, "new website"

2014-08-23 23:48:27	@J	replaced some Pikipedia content with Pikmin Wiki content instead of appending
2014-08-23 23:48:39	@J	made some pages blank for no apparent reason
2014-08-23 23:49:13	@J	I don't even know how it's possible for it to end up with a blank page unless it was already blank on one of the wikis, which it wasn't

2014-08-24 00:53:46	@PikFan	is it based off of Snowpeak?
2014-08-24 00:54:28	ZoltCat	i'm thinking of Majoras Mask. I' pretty shure it's called Snowhead
2014-08-24 00:54:44	@PikFan	wait yeah
2014-08-24 00:56:10	ZoltCat	any way to make it a pikmin area?

2014-08-24 01:00:18	@PikFan	as I'm not familiar with the layout of Snowhead, I'm not sure what I can do

2014-08-24 01:00:39	@PikFan	that's a start
2014-08-24 01:02:32	ZoltCat	I got a good idea what the Pllouded  Pond will look like as well.
2014-08-24 01:02:48	@PikFan	good!
2014-08-24 01:02:55	@PikFan	start writing these ideas down

2014-08-24 15:10:38	ZoltCat	I've seen on other wikis where you can hide part of a page to help keep peeps from spoiling games/movies for them self's. How do i add that to my page??? 
2014-08-24 15:17:39	@Espyo	we have that on our wiki too
2014-08-24 15:17:49	@Espyo	on [[Hocotate ship]], for instance

2014-08-24 19:16:47	@PikFan	hi
2014-08-24 19:18:01	@Espyo	hi
2014-08-24 19:18:19	@PikFan	so I woke up today, really excited for the update
2014-08-24 19:18:30	@Espyo	but alas
2014-08-24 19:18:45	@PikFan	I rush into the living room, boot up the Wii U, and go to the beta
2014-08-24 19:18:52	@PikFan	and no update
2014-08-24 19:19:01	@PikFan	now I'm heartbroken
2014-08-24 19:19:08	@Espyo	:(
2014-08-24 19:19:13	@Espyo	well, he didn't say what time
2014-08-24 19:19:31	@PikFan	if he's going to release it he has less than 4 hours
2014-08-24 19:19:43	@PikFan	to meet his expectation
2014-08-24 19:19:55	@PikFan	also, a ton of new posts: http://orteil42.tumblr.com/
2014-08-24 19:20:12	@PikFan	apparently they're having problems with the new Dashnet layout
2014-08-24 19:20:17	@PikFan	something or other
2014-08-24 19:20:49	@PikFan	anyway
2014-08-24 19:20:56	@PikFan	UPGRADES THAT COST HEAVENLY CHIPS
2014-08-24 19:21:07	@PikFan	good thing I have 800K
2014-08-24 19:21:07	Testyo	800 K = 526.85 °C / 980.33 °F
2014-08-24 19:21:48	@PikFan	hah, they must be so expensive that Orteil had to use HCs
2014-08-24 19:22:16	@Espyo	oh man...
2014-08-24 19:22:42	@PikFan	I'm working really hard now for bicentennial
2014-08-24 19:23:10	@PikFan	since it's likely the beta will come out tomorrow, the live version will be a few days away
2014-08-24 19:23:26	@Espyo	there's just something that's making me sad in seeing all those screenshots
2014-08-24 19:23:26	@PikFan	just barely enough time for bicentennial
2014-08-24 19:23:38	@PikFan	ikr
2014-08-24 19:23:50	@Espyo	with the new update, my computer will take 8 hours to open calculator
2014-08-24 19:24:04	@PikFan	...oh boy
2014-08-24 19:24:04	@Espyo	all those menus, graphical effects, and whatnot? in javascript?
2014-08-24 19:24:08	@Espyo	that's a recipe for death
2014-08-24 19:24:19	@Espyo	he can probably optimize it so they don't mess around when the window is not focused
2014-08-24 19:24:23	@Espyo	which I seriously hope he does
2014-08-24 19:24:35	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-24 19:24:36	@Espyo	because even though currently the game uses less resources when out of focus, I still don't think it's enough
2014-08-24 19:24:41	@Espyo	it should just avoid rendering altogether
2014-08-24 19:26:21	@PikFan	when the image with the season switcher + its upgrades came out, I thought it was like some sort of... uh
2014-08-24 19:26:36	@PikFan	some kind of upgrade "tree"
2014-08-24 19:28:11	@Espyo	which?

2014-08-24 19:28:40	@PikFan	wrong one
2014-08-24 19:28:51	@Espyo	thought so

2014-08-24 19:29:33	@Espyo	oh, I see what you mean
2014-08-24 19:29:41	@PikFan	yeah, I thought it was some sort of tree, categorizing your upgrades
2014-08-24 19:31:26	@PikFan	HOLY FUCK

2014-08-24 19:32:48	@Espyo	...right?
2014-08-24 19:33:07	@PikFan	he did say he had some pretty insane goals
2014-08-24 19:33:10	@Espyo	"it's a joke for now"
2014-08-24 19:33:35	@PikFan	where does it say that?
2014-08-24 19:34:30	@Espyo	on the image
2014-08-24 19:34:31	@Espyo	midway through
2014-08-24 19:34:38	@PikFan	yeah, found it
2014-08-24 19:36:12	@PikFan	ah, so it is a tree
2014-08-24 19:36:23	@Espyo	yup
2014-08-24 19:36:27	@Espyo	I got that idea
2014-08-24 19:38:55	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-24 19:39:20	@PikFan	if 1,000 prisms achievement is a thing, then the last prism will cost 1.1470126025135525576072922465641e+76 cookies
2014-08-24 19:40:00	@PikFan	which is us
2014-08-24 19:40:03	@PikFan	*uh
2014-08-24 19:40:30	@PikFan	about 11 quattuorvigintillion
2014-08-24 19:40:40	@Espyo	that can't be a real number
2014-08-24 19:40:50	@PikFan	it is
2014-08-24 19:40:55	@PikFan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers
2014-08-24 19:40:57	@Espyo	has science gone too far?
2014-08-24 19:41:22	@PikFan	last summer I was teaching myself about the latin prefixes for big numbers
2014-08-24 19:41:27	@Espyo	I'm surprised at how Orteil managed to make all those huge numbers without bringing Javascript to its knees
2014-08-24 19:41:31	@Espyo	Javascript is no pushover, but
2014-08-24 19:41:33	@Espyo	it's JUST Javascript
2014-08-24 19:41:44	@Espyo	how can it even manage numbers that big without vomiting?
2014-08-24 19:41:57	@Espyo	I don't need to try to understand because my language has Latin roots
2014-08-24 19:42:23	@Espyo	tri três
2014-08-24 19:42:25	@Espyo	quad quatro
2014-08-24 19:42:32	@Espyo	quint cinco (maybe not this one)
2014-08-24 19:42:36	@Espyo	sex seis
2014-08-24 19:42:43	@Espyo	hept sete (close enough)
2014-08-24 19:42:45	@Espyo	octo oito
2014-08-24 19:42:47	@Espyo	noni nove
2014-08-24 19:42:50	@Espyo	deci dez
2014-08-24 19:43:06	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-24 19:43:10	@Espyo	that "vingintillion" part on your number must mean there's something "twenty" about it (vinte)
2014-08-24 19:43:24	@PikFan	I guess
2014-08-24 19:43:36	@Espyo	which makes me think you miswrote
2014-08-24 19:43:38	@PikFan	"quatturo" means four
2014-08-24 19:43:49	@PikFan	I copied it
2014-08-24 19:43:49	@Espyo	should be quattro
2014-08-24 19:43:52	@Espyo	really
2014-08-24 19:43:53	@Espyo	*?
2014-08-24 19:43:57	@PikFan	yep
2014-08-24 19:44:00	@Espyo	don't remember Latin being that broken
2014-08-24 19:44:24	@PikFan	yeah, here's the table: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers#Extensions_of_the_standard_dictionary_numbers
2014-08-24 19:44:40	@Espyo	oh
2014-08-24 19:45:34	@Espyo	you know what'd be easier
2014-08-24 19:45:43	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-08-24 19:46:01	@Espyo	if we just used scientific notation
2014-08-24 19:46:11	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-24 19:46:19	@Espyo	 30x10^9 cookies
2014-08-24 19:46:29	@Espyo	I can't for the life of me understand scientific notation, even though I'm an engineer
2014-08-24 19:46:42	@Espyo	but dammit, if we keep this up, Cookie Clicker stops being a game about clicking cookies and becomes a tongue twister
2014-08-24 19:47:00	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-24 19:47:11	@PikFan	people think that CC is a game for 3 year olds
2014-08-24 19:47:31	@PikFan	once you play it though you'll see that it's very complex and sophisticated
2014-08-24 19:52:44	@PikFan	yesterday I got like 4 or 5 F+CF

2014-08-24 22:02:15	@PikFan	someone needs to tell him about fanon
2014-08-24 22:02:41	@PikFan	in small amounts, fan content is fine
2014-08-24 22:02:57	@PikFan	but when you've got that much content you need to move it to fanon
2014-08-24 22:04:41	ZoltCat	i didn't bother reading it but i do agree

2014-08-24 22:12:45	ZoltCat	why wold he do that?
2014-08-24 22:13:13	@PikFan	ZoltCat: looks good
2014-08-24 22:13:27	@PikFan	Espyo: .../why/
2014-08-24 22:13:38	@Espyo	looks ugly
2014-08-24 22:13:54	@PikFan	it looks okay to me
2014-08-24 22:14:09	ZoltCat	thanks! ... Did i do something wrong with the bulbare link?
2014-08-24 22:14:10	@PikFan	but I've been on it for 3 and a half years, so
2014-08-24 22:14:22	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-24 22:14:27	@PikFan	it's Spotty Bulbear

2014-08-24 22:16:35	@PikFan	still, all that fan content on his user page concerns me
2014-08-24 22:16:43	@Espyo	short answers because I was phoning my mum
2014-08-24 22:16:54	@PikFan	ah
2014-08-24 22:17:01	@Espyo	I'm surprised at how I didn't trip up, considering I was hearing Portuguese and typing English with one hand
2014-08-24 22:17:09	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-24 22:17:10	@Espyo	but anyway, I THINK Aero dislikes fanon
2014-08-24 22:17:12	@Espyo	a few do
2014-08-24 22:17:15	@Espyo	I can't honestly blame the
2014-08-24 22:17:16	@Espyo	*them
2014-08-24 22:17:19	@Espyo	[[f:Green Pikmin]]
2014-08-24 22:17:19	Testyo	"Green_Pikmin" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Green_Pikmin
2014-08-24 22:17:20	@Espyo	*shudder*
2014-08-24 22:17:55	@PikFan	the first few sections are alright
2014-08-24 22:18:02	@PikFan	but after that...
2014-08-24 22:18:46	@PikFan	it's going to take a massive effort to try to clean up the wiki
2014-08-24 22:19:15	@PikFan	I fear that Fanon will turn to dust
2014-08-24 22:20:02	@PikFan	also, I don't mean to be pointing fingers, but...
2014-08-24 22:20:22	@PikFan	they think that Fanon isn't clean
2014-08-24 22:20:32	@PikFan	yet they have a bunch of articles themselves that need cleaning
2014-08-24 22:22:17	@Espyo	hehe
2014-08-24 22:22:26	@Espyo	but at least they maintain minimal styles and such
2014-08-24 22:22:31	@Espyo	some pages on Fanon are just illegal
2014-08-24 22:22:37	@PikFan	I agree
2014-08-24 22:23:03	@PikFan	ugh
2014-08-24 22:23:17	@PikFan	why can't people learn how to TYPE
2014-08-24 22:23:43	@Espyo	Fanon gives the idea of a more laid-back place
2014-08-24 22:23:52	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-08-24 22:23:54	@Espyo	plus a lot of its users are probably under 10
2014-08-24 22:23:58	@PikFan	that needs to be changed
2014-08-24 22:24:30	@PikFan	which will likely never happen
2014-08-24 22:24:32	@PikFan	sadly
2014-08-24 22:24:35	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-24 22:24:45	@PikFan	it's really sad
2014-08-24 22:24:52	@PikFan	because Fanon is a great site
2014-08-24 22:25:00	@PikFan	it has a lot of potential
2014-08-24 22:25:13	@PikFan	but most of the users barely know how to type
2014-08-24 22:25:20	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-08-24 22:25:28	@Espyo	maybe the engine will lighten it up
2014-08-24 22:25:44	@PikFan	they think that since it's the internet, they can type however style they see fit
2014-08-24 22:25:53	@PikFan	on social media, yeah
2014-08-24 22:25:56	@PikFan	but wikis, no
2014-08-24 22:26:35	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-24 22:26:51	@Espyo	even on social media, sometimes people should get slapped for typing like they do
2014-08-24 22:26:57	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-24 22:27:06	@PikFan	it's awful
2014-08-24 22:27:15	@PikFan	they should never be allowed to type like that
2014-08-24 22:27:46	@PikFan	in schools, they need to put a lot more emphasis on English classes
2014-08-24 22:28:02	@PikFan	as it stands now, a new language has been created
2014-08-24 22:32:49	@Espyo	you should have to do a test before going on the internet
2014-08-24 22:33:03	@Espyo	it'd help with stuff like people catching viruses and falling for scams
2014-08-24 22:33:30	@PikFan	ooh
2014-08-24 22:34:02	@PikFan	I was thinking something along those lines yesterday
2014-08-24 22:34:27	@PikFan	ok, so in a few years, internet should be available globally
2014-08-24 22:34:35	@PikFan	you can access it /anywhere/
2014-08-24 22:34:48	@PikFan	but in order to do so, you must first make an account
2014-08-24 22:35:31	@PikFan	and, taking your idea, part of the account creation process requires you to take a test
2014-08-24 22:36:05	@PikFan	depending on your results, you'll be able to access certain parts of the internet
2014-08-24 22:36:21	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-24 22:36:25	@PikFan	scratch that
2014-08-24 22:36:39	@PikFan	that seems a bit too controlling
2014-08-24 22:37:07	@PikFan	ugh
2014-08-24 22:37:15	@PikFan	will bad grammar ever go away?
2014-08-24 22:37:33	@Espyo	yeah, that'd be cool, except for one problem
2014-08-24 22:37:35	@Espyo	it takes away privacy
2014-08-24 22:37:42	@Espyo	you're on facebook
2014-08-24 22:37:46	@Espyo	and you get ads with porn products
2014-08-24 22:37:49	@Espyo	because you browsed youporn earlier
2014-08-24 22:38:15	@Espyo	or ads about throat medicine because you googled "homemade cold medicine" some years back
2014-08-24 22:38:27	@Espyo	I mean, they probably already happen nowadays, because of the complex network of ads, but
2014-08-24 22:38:34	@PikFan	yeah, I was thinking about the privacy thing
2014-08-24 22:38:43	@Espyo	also problems with losing anonymity in places where it's important
2014-08-24 22:39:09	@PikFan	but this account just enables you to get on the internet
2014-08-24 22:39:16	@PikFan	nothing else
2014-08-24 22:39:44	@PikFan	kind of like signing in on a computer

2014-08-24 22:40:36	@PikFan	hi
2014-08-24 22:40:55	ZoltCat	sry it took me so long. had to take a shower.
2014-08-24 22:41:07	@PikFan	it's fine
2014-08-24 22:41:59	ZoltCat	is it just me, or does my map of snow head look like a person (sorta)?
2014-08-24 22:42:43	@PikFan	kinda
2014-08-24 22:43:00	@PikFan	except the torso has three extra appendages
2014-08-24 22:44:13	ZoltCat	maybe it's mutant?
2014-08-24 22:44:30	@PikFan	idk
2014-08-24 22:45:26	ZoltCat	i STILL think it's missing something....uggg....i told you maps aren't my thing
2014-08-24 22:48:35	ZoltCat	plus it LOOKS SO BAD. Sadly, Paint is my only art program. I'm not allowed to download more.
2014-08-24 22:49:04	@PikFan	this was made with Paint, and it's pretty good http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/2/27/Benine_Bosk.jpg
2014-08-24 22:49:23	ZoltCat	...so i just suck?
2014-08-24 22:49:37	@PikFan	no
2014-08-24 22:49:41	@PikFan	just practice
2014-08-24 22:49:54	@PikFan	everything takes practice
2014-08-24 22:50:49	ZoltCat	ok. my ver. of paint is outdated anyways. 
2014-08-24 22:51:03	@PikFan	I see

2014-08-25 19:21:58	@Espyo	hi
2014-08-25 19:22:02	@PikFan	about 40 new upgrades
2014-08-25 19:22:05	@J	but some are completely different files, so I'll have to rename the Pikmin Wiki one, then check for references to it
2014-08-25 19:22:06	@Espyo	all right

2014-08-25 19:53:52	@Espyo	right
2014-08-25 19:54:02	@PikFan	ok so
2014-08-25 19:54:10	@PikFan	I imported my save
2014-08-25 19:54:12	@Espyo	well, I'll join the new stuff train when the non-beta comes
2014-08-25 19:54:18	@PikFan	then I ascended
2014-08-25 19:54:23	@PikFan	and reincarnated
2014-08-25 19:54:33	@PikFan	(in other words, I reset)
2014-08-25 19:54:38	@PikFan	then played for a bit
2014-08-25 19:54:48	@PikFan	and my cps ended up in the hundred quintillions
2014-08-25 19:55:17	@Espyo	wow
2014-08-25 19:56:36	@PikFan	I was making so many cookies so quickly that an hour had gone by, and if I had reset then, I would've gained over 500k chips
2014-08-25 19:56:37	Testyo	500 K = 226.85 °C / 440.33 °F
2014-08-25 19:56:55	@PikFan	but I wiped that save
2014-08-25 19:57:02	@PikFan	I'm restarting it
2014-08-25 19:57:49	@Espyo	hehe
2014-08-25 19:57:59	@PikFan	oh yeah, and I somehow ran into a negative number of heavenly chips
2014-08-25 19:58:21	@PikFan	because when you're ascending, you can bake heavenly cookies
2014-08-25 19:58:26	@PikFan	which are the new chips
2014-08-25 19:58:35	@PikFan	it takes 10 chips to make 1 cookie
2014-08-25 19:58:53	@PikFan	and when fully upgraded, cookies give only +1% cps
2014-08-25 19:59:17	@PikFan	thing is, THEY STACK MULTIPLICATIVELY
2014-08-25 19:59:53	@PikFan	anyway, when I was baking the cookies, I ended up with a negative amount of chips
2014-08-25 20:00:03	@Espyo	wow
2014-08-25 20:01:14	@PikFan	yay, EF+R
2014-08-25 20:01:18	@PikFan	(live)
2014-08-25 20:01:34	@PikFan	sooooo close

2014-08-25 20:03:31	@Espyo	nice
2014-08-25 20:03:45	@PikFan	44.29 sex right now
2014-08-25 20:04:12	@PikFan	if I pop wrinklers now I'll get 280.75 sex
2014-08-25 20:04:59	@PikFan	when I buy my 196th prism, I'm hoping that wrinklers will have enough cookies to pay off the last 4 prisms
2014-08-25 20:05:27	@PikFan	they need to have...

2014-08-25 20:08:30	@PikFan	okay
2014-08-25 20:09:32	@PikFan	so 8 minutes into the run and I'm at 26.684 quint per second
2014-08-25 20:10:19	@PikFan	heh, I think getting 200 prisms is going to be easier
2014-08-25 20:10:36	@PikFan	even though all 200 costs somewhere around 21 oct
2014-08-25 20:10:59	@Espyo	good grief
2014-08-25 20:19:07	@PikFan	I predict that hundreds of millions of chips will become the norm
2014-08-25 20:19:36	@PikFan	and hundreds of billions or even trillions will be for the extreme ultra-late game folks
2014-08-25 20:20:34	@PikFan	I think if you have a trillion chips, you'll be in the undecillions
2014-08-25 20:21:05	@PikFan	because I hacked the beta last night, because I wanted to see the new upgrades/achievements
2014-08-25 20:21:25	@PikFan	and I remember when I ascended, my chips were in the trillions
2014-08-25 20:21:45	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-25 20:23:53	@PikFan	honestly I don't like the new icons

2014-08-25 20:44:48	Krankomat	I felt the need to play Pikmin 2 recently, after finishing Pikmin 3

2014-08-25 20:46:08	Krankomat	Nintendo really missed out on the CGI Intro and Outro - that was pretty good in the second part

2014-08-25 21:12:30	@J	and if just one, which
2014-08-25 21:13:01	@J	same goes for some music: Pikmin Wiki has longer, higher-quality versions (around 50s, ours are 30s)
2014-08-25 21:13:13	@J	but we need to be careful about fair use

2014-08-25 21:19:08	@Espyo	yeah, translating everything into German would be
2014-08-25 21:19:09	@Espyo	uh...
2014-08-25 21:19:15	@Espyo	godlike, at least

2014-08-25 21:22:03	Krankomat	yeah well
2014-08-25 21:22:20	Krankomat	i'll see how much time I'll find to translate stuff
2014-08-25 21:22:43	Krankomat	i mainly got active in the wiki again because of holiday boredom
2014-08-25 21:22:54	Krankomat	and the fact i played pikmin 3 recently

2014-08-25 21:24:22	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-25 21:24:38	@Espyo	I think even the German translators for the Carmageddon Wiki are only doing the main pages, anyway
2014-08-25 21:24:59	@PikFan	J: just curious, what would you put in /monobook.css?
2014-08-25 21:25:41	@Espyo	any CSS
2014-08-25 21:25:43	@Espyo	it'll apply to you
2014-08-25 21:25:56	@PikFan	I understand that
2014-08-25 21:26:15	@PikFan	but what would you write to make it so that you had that cursor?
2014-08-25 21:26:49	@Espyo	what you have on Pikmin Wiki
2014-08-25 21:27:00	@Espyo	uh... body{ cursor: url(bla bla.ico); }
2014-08-25 21:27:01	@Espyo	or something
2014-08-25 21:27:10	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-25 21:27:28	@PikFan	that would probably be the simplest way to do it
2014-08-25 21:27:33	@J	the lines Espyo pointed to
2014-08-25 21:27:46	@PikFan	instead of having to go through all those other steps
2014-08-25 21:28:26	@J	there's even a special page that links you to the current user's page
2014-08-25 21:28:30	@J	forget what it's called

2014-08-25 22:27:24	@PikFan	I have almost 2 million heavenly cookies, and my cps is at freaking 6.353 sextillion
2014-08-25 22:27:40	@Espyo	wow

2014-08-25 22:28:40	@PikFan	now I'm going for Obliterate
2014-08-25 22:29:06	@PikFan	and maybe next run I can get 200 prisms
2014-08-25 22:33:23	@PikFan	so I just did a calculation
2014-08-25 22:33:37	@PikFan	if I get an F+CF in the beta, I'll get over 1 oct
2014-08-25 22:33:53	@PikFan	Orteil... you're insane

2014-08-25 23:02:30	@PikFan	baked this game?
2014-08-25 23:02:32	@Espyo	uh, can't check cps because I JUST clicked a Frenzy

2014-08-25 23:02:49	@Espyo	hm, right, but I'm too lazy
2014-08-25 23:02:53	@Espyo	let's just wait 2 minutes or so
2014-08-25 23:02:57	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-25 23:03:03	@Espyo	 163 ACs, 161 Prisms
2014-08-25 23:03:09	@Espyo	I gotta invest on ACs first
2014-08-25 23:03:15	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-25 23:03:16	@Espyo	still way too far to get Prisms reliably
2014-08-25 23:03:25	@PikFan	what's your big goal for this run?
2014-08-25 23:03:36	@Espyo	 200 ACs
2014-08-25 23:03:40	@Espyo	haven't gotten it yet, so achievement
2014-08-25 23:03:43	@PikFan	eeeh...
2014-08-25 23:04:08	@PikFan	I'd wait to do that until you get at least 300k chips
2014-08-25 23:04:08	Testyo	300 K = 26.85 °C / 80.33 °F
2014-08-25 23:04:30	@PikFan	...though by the time you do, the game will have been updated
2014-08-25 23:04:47	@PikFan	it doesn't matter anyway
2014-08-25 23:04:56	@PikFan	your cps will go through the roof
2014-08-25 23:04:56	@Espyo	heh
2014-08-25 23:05:15	@Espyo	I think I can buy them after a bit
2014-08-25 23:11:54	@PikFan	earlier today I added the new achievements to the list on Cookie Clicker Wiki
2014-08-25 23:12:03	@PikFan	but I couldn't add the icons

2014-08-26 19:26:34	@Espyo	I didn't check because P3

2014-08-26 19:27:14	@PikFan	"Nobody's got time to read through that"
2014-08-26 19:27:29	@PikFan	uh
2014-08-26 19:27:38	@Espyo	he doesn't quite get the concept of text guides
2014-08-26 19:27:52	@Espyo	we are a text wiki, duh

2014-08-26 19:28:03	@Espyo	now, whether we have VIDEO guides too or not
2014-08-26 19:28:05	@Espyo	that's another thing
2014-08-26 19:28:09	@PikFan	I want to reply, but I'm afraid I'll come off as offensive
2014-08-26 19:28:10	@Espyo	but there have to be text guides
2014-08-26 19:28:15	@PikFan	yes
2014-08-26 19:28:21	@PikFan	or there'd be no point
2014-08-26 19:28:23	@Espyo	it's like not having a wiki because you can just learn everything about the game via Let's Plays
2014-08-26 19:28:50	@Espyo	only things you wouldn't know that a wiki could tell you would be the technical properties of stuff, and stuff like the gas pipes in P2 respawning after 99 days
2014-08-26 19:29:35	@Espyo	I'll answer
2014-08-26 19:29:45	@PikFan	okay, thanks
2014-08-26 19:30:20	@PikFan	I was going to say "We can't replace strategies with videos - neither is it feasible, nor is it reasonable"
2014-08-26 19:32:46	@Espyo	I think I answered well
2014-08-26 19:32:50	@PikFan	I think this is part of the reason why they didn't have the best quality
2014-08-26 19:33:31	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-26 19:33:42	@Espyo	they don't have many guidelines, so it's every man for himself
2014-08-26 19:33:49	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-26 19:35:05	@PikFan	in other news, on the beta, I have so many cookies
2014-08-26 19:35:13	@PikFan	so many
2014-08-26 19:35:24	@PikFan	you don't want to know
2014-08-26 19:35:41	@Espyo	hehehe
2014-08-26 19:35:43	@Espyo	I'll know eventually
2014-08-26 19:36:11	@PikFan	part of the reason why there's so many is because heavenly cookies are bugged
2014-08-26 19:36:27	@PikFan	their effect is 10 times greater than what it should be
2014-08-26 19:36:55	@PikFan	also, Orteil said he's going to nerf the last few buildings

2014-08-26 19:38:12	@PikFan	bright side is, he's going to be adding more prestige upgrades
2014-08-26 19:38:22	@PikFan	35 is not nearly enough
2014-08-26 19:38:48	@PikFan	he did say he'd be releasing it in stages
2014-08-26 19:39:45	@PikFan	yay
2014-08-26 19:39:51	@PikFan	27 second elder frenzy
2014-08-26 19:40:24	@PikFan	there's a prestige upgrade that makes wrath cookie effects last twice as long
2014-08-26 19:40:33	@PikFan	so clot lasts nearly 5 minutes now
2014-08-26 19:40:49	@PikFan	but meh, I just export/import save whenever I get a clot

2014-08-26 19:58:10	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-26 19:58:37	@PikFan	okay, so Orteil said he's going to redo some of the shadow achievements, like speed baking
2014-08-26 19:58:43	@PikFan	and turn them into challenge runs
2014-08-26 19:58:57	@PikFan	I wonder if challenge runs will give you HCs
2014-08-26 19:59:28	@PikFan	like, you want to take a challenge run, and then you have to risk a certain amount of chips
2014-08-26 20:00:03	@Espyo	hehe

2014-08-27 22:07:01	@J	2014-08-25 21:13:01     @J      same goes for some music: Pikmin Wiki has longer, higher-quality versions (around 50s, ours are 30s)
2014-08-27 22:07:01	@J	2014-08-25 21:13:13     @J      but we need to be careful about fair use
2014-08-27 22:07:04	@J	do it do it
2014-08-27 22:07:25	@Espyo	hm, right
2014-08-27 22:10:27	@Espyo	I guess I'd go with their audio

2014-08-27 22:15:54	@J	wait, just realised a load of these I'm about to replace are things you replaced a while back
2014-08-27 22:16:25	@J	your comment for each is 'No border.', and you've uploaded a similar screenshot with no border instead of just cropping
2014-08-27 22:16:29	@J	but all of yours are lower-quality
2014-08-27 22:16:44	@J	so I was cropping the originals and using those
2014-08-27 22:21:15	@J	okay, I'll wait for you to reply about those before I do the ones that definitely need renames

2014-08-29 20:27:27	Prezintenden	wuh i haven't been keeping track of anything from nintendo
2014-08-29 20:29:19	@Espyo	could swear I heard it
2014-08-29 20:29:29	Prezintenden	yeah there's pokemon and smash bros but, egh. It's been less than stellar this year for me, literally just pikmin
2014-08-29 20:29:49	@Espyo	game consoles look like they're dying lately
2014-08-29 20:31:09	Prezintenden	I know that all the launches flopped really hard, not sure how they've recovered. But I've never been so disinterested in buying a  next gen console and keeping the releases in track, so yeah i guess that says something on its own
2014-08-29 20:32:38	@Espyo	mhm
2014-08-29 20:32:45	@Espyo	luckily, I'm very hyped for smash 4
2014-08-29 20:33:30	Prezintenden	I don't know what to think of the handheld version. It's not like I'm a  tourney-player but... isn't it completely different with the DS?
2014-08-29 20:34:41	Prezintenden	Can't wait for Wii U, but the DS... "I can't wait to see what this feels like with a controller I'm used to and an HD screen!"
2014-08-29 20:36:50	@Espyo	even Nintendo agrees the 3DS version is casual
2014-08-29 20:36:58	@Espyo	they said in one update that the achievements for 3DS are easier
2014-08-29 20:37:28	Prezintenden	gah that sounds so odd
2014-08-29 20:38:01	Prezintenden	I guess it makes sense since there's far more DS players, but I guess I'll just wait for the wii U
2014-08-29 20:38:07	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-29 20:38:15	@Espyo	I hope Smash 4 Wii U is actually REALLY more competitive
2014-08-29 20:38:29	@Espyo	Brawl is ultra fun, but people mock Brawl players over how casual it is, and with good reason
2014-08-29 20:39:07	Prezintenden	From what i gathered they're aiming to be a bit more tourney-friendly than brawl but not much
2014-08-29 20:39:33	Prezintenden	so, egh, guess it'll keep its status at "that game" that's played at EVO
2014-08-29 20:39:37	Prezintenden	*as
2014-08-29 20:39:41	@Espyo	unfortunately
2014-08-29 21:28:17	@J	.
2014-08-29 21:28:33	@J	so apparently Ludum Dare just happened
2014-08-29 21:28:36	@J	I didn't even notice
2014-08-29 21:28:43	@J	the site normally emails me a few weeks before
2014-08-29 21:34:35	@Espyo	oh, shoot

2014-08-30 21:40:33	@Espyo	actually no
2014-08-30 21:40:41	@Espyo	maybe one of these days... months
2014-08-30 21:41:04	@Espyo	I mean, I DID just buy a Wii U, and am going to buy a tablet soon
2014-08-30 21:41:08	@Espyo	and at SOME point, a 3DS
2014-08-30 21:47:31	@J	can't say I really ever saw the point of a tablet
2014-08-30 21:50:20	@Espyo	simple
2014-08-30 21:50:45	@Espyo	I have a 1 hour subway trip to go to work

2014-08-30 21:51:07	@Espyo	at the least, I could read the engine's code and try to come up with ideas to optimize it
2014-08-30 21:51:12	@Espyo	(performance and organization)
2014-08-30 21:51:23	@Espyo	with a tablet, I can install a notepad app, and go to town
2014-08-30 21:52:10	@J	but no keyboard makes me sad

2014-08-30 22:13:13	@J	that's not editing the code
2014-08-30 22:13:20	@Espyo	yeah, but I need to read the code
2014-08-30 22:13:26	@J	oh
2014-08-30 22:13:39	@J	hmm, I guess I just tend to remember it all

2014-08-31 20:33:00	@Espyo	yeah, on that page ^
2014-08-31 20:33:17	@Espyo	scroll down a bit, until you find the birthday update section, which is the latest version

2014-08-31 20:33:38	@Espyo	https://github.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine/releases/tag/alpha-0.4 actually, it's here
2014-08-31 20:33:41	@Espyo	that's easier
2014-08-31 20:35:12	WikiGuest	What about iOS
2014-08-31 20:35:20	@Espyo	I have no plans to make an iOS version, I'm afraid
2014-08-31 20:35:27	@Espyo	it's not as easy as developing for windows
2014-08-31 20:35:33	@Espyo	maybe one day in the future
2014-08-31 20:35:52	WikiGuest	:(
2014-08-31 20:36:22	WikiGuest	Mac?
2014-08-31 20:36:27	@Espyo	probably
2014-08-31 20:36:31	@Espyo	but only when it's ready
2014-08-31 20:36:41	@Espyo	for now, I'll only release these development versions for windows
2014-08-31 20:37:01	WikiGuest	:/
2014-08-31 20:37:05	@Espyo	sorry :(
2014-08-31 20:37:15	@Espyo	if I had a Mac, I'd work on trying to get it to work there
2014-08-31 20:37:19	@Espyo	but I wouldn't even know where to start
2014-08-31 20:37:24	@Espyo	so maybe one day in the future

2014-08-31 20:39:25	WikiGuest	Th<beeep>ks
2014-08-31 20:40:29	WikiGuest	But how do you work this thing
2014-08-31 20:40:37	@Espyo	on windows?
2014-08-31 20:40:40	@Espyo	you just download that and play it
2014-08-31 20:40:51	WikiGuest	Not the engine, the chat
2014-08-31 20:40:54	@Espyo	ah
2014-08-31 20:40:58	@Espyo	well, you're using it right now
2014-08-31 20:41:02	@Espyo	there's some help on the topic, at the top
2014-08-31 20:41:10	@Espyo	http://pikminwiki.com/Help:Chat
2014-08-31 20:41:14	@Espyo	that should tell you everything
2014-08-31 20:41:18	WikiGuest	How do you leave?
2014-08-31 20:41:27	@Espyo	you can just close the tab you're on
2014-08-31 20:41:29	@Espyo	or window
2014-08-31 20:41:44	WikiGuest	What is an idler?
2014-08-31 20:41:52	@Espyo	it's a person that hasn't said anything for a while
2014-08-31 20:41:55	<--	ZoltCat (Mibbit@yoo-190-627-771-125.cinci.res.rr.com) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2014-08-31 20:42:00	@Espyo	so it's like they're idling, instead of chatting actively
2014-08-31 20:42:16	WikiGuest	What does the star mean?
2014-08-31 20:42:29	@Espyo	means someone is an administrator on the chat
2014-08-31 20:43:13	WikiGuest	Diff?
2014-08-31 20:43:36	@Espyo	where's diff?
2014-08-31 20:43:43	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Frontier Cavern by Espyo (+119 Thanks, Denevérek!) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Frontier_Cavern&curid=602&diff=137890&oldid=134403

2014-08-31 20:43:45	@Espyo	diff is short for "difference"
2014-08-31 20:44:14	WikiGuest	I meant what's the diff between a admin and a normal chatter
2014-08-31 20:44:24	@Espyo	ah, right
2014-08-31 20:44:32	@Espyo	an admin can change the topic and kick or ban people
2014-08-31 20:44:41	@Espyo	so they're responsible for keeping the chat a tidy place
2014-08-31 20:44:48	@Espyo	and if somebody gets out of line, it's an admin's job to kick them
2014-08-31 20:44:56	WikiGuest	What is kicking?
2014-08-31 20:45:14	@Espyo	kicking is when an admin forcefully throws a user out of the chatroom
2014-08-31 20:45:24	@Espyo	normally if they're abusing something
2014-08-31 20:45:55	WikiGuest	How do you know you've been kicked?
2014-08-31 20:46:12	@Espyo	you get a message saying an admin has kicked you, and you have to rejoin the chatroom
2014-08-31 20:46:42	WikiGuest	What's the diff between kicking and banning?
2014-08-31 20:46:56	@Espyo	kicking is just throwing somebody off, but they can join again
2014-08-31 20:46:58	@Espyo	it's more like a warning
2014-08-31 20:47:04	@Espyo	banning completely blocks the person from coming back
2014-08-31 20:47:44	WikiGuest	Is there any other additional titles?
2014-08-31 20:47:51	@Espyo	hmm, let's see...
2014-08-31 20:47:56	@Espyo	there are a few, but they're all minor
2014-08-31 20:48:02	@Espyo	I don't think it works here, but there's an half-op title
2014-08-31 20:48:07	@Espyo	means something like half-administrator
2014-08-31 20:48:16	@Espyo	it's almost the same thing, except they have a few powers less
2014-08-31 20:48:19	@Espyo	can't remember which
2014-08-31 20:48:32	@Espyo	there's also owner, which is the person that owns the chat, and has the highest power of them all
2014-08-31 20:48:34	WikiGuest	What about moderator?
2014-08-31 20:48:42	@Espyo	they're pretty much the same as admins here
2014-08-31 20:48:57	@Espyo	an op in a chatroom is an admin or a moderator, they mean the same
2014-08-31 20:49:31	WikiGuest	That's odd, because the NIWA channel has both diffed.
2014-08-31 20:49:58	@Espyo	must be the half-op I talked about
2014-08-31 20:50:02	@Espyo	op being admin, and half-op being moderator
2014-08-31 20:50:07	@Espyo	here, it doesn't make a difference
2014-08-31 20:50:19	WikiGuest	Who is the owner?
2014-08-31 20:50:54	@Espyo	good question, actually
2014-08-31 20:50:56	@Espyo	not sure
2014-08-31 20:51:04	@Espyo	oh, it's J
2014-08-31 20:51:10	-->	PikFan (Mibbit@u-78-94-868-36.hsd6.or.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2014-08-31 20:51:10	--	Mode #pikipedia [+o PikFan] by ChanServ
2014-08-31 20:51:19	@Espyo	the IRC SHOULD differentiate between owner and admin
2014-08-31 20:51:21	@Espyo	but I guess it doesn't
2014-08-31 20:51:22	@PikFan	hi
2014-08-31 20:51:33	@PikFan	what did I walk in on?
2014-08-31 20:51:36	@Espyo	speaking of owner, PikFan is second-in-charge for owner, in case J leaves
2014-08-31 20:51:47	@Espyo	this user's learning about how IRC works
2014-08-31 20:51:57	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-08-31 20:52:27	WikiGuest	Op requirements?
2014-08-31 20:54:16	@Espyo	be a user for years, be respected by the community, and show that you have what it takes to be somebody who can moderate the chatroom without problem
2014-08-31 20:54:54	@Espyo	PikFan: you know in P3 when you're knocked down, and you mash the stick to get up?
2014-08-31 20:55:03	@PikFan	yeah?
2014-08-31 20:55:09	@Espyo	can you get up on your own? and when does it happen? every time you're knocked to the ground, or just specific attacks?
2014-08-31 20:55:23	@PikFan	it says to keep circling the stick
2014-08-31 20:55:30	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-31 20:55:37	WikiGuest	Bye
2014-08-31 20:55:40	@Espyo	bye
2014-08-31 20:55:42	@PikFan	takes about a second
2014-08-31 20:55:43	<--	WikiGuest (Mibbit@57-73-285-29.client.mchsi.com) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2014-08-31 20:55:43	@PikFan	bye
2014-08-31 20:55:48	@Espyo	they asked a few questions
2014-08-31 20:55:56	@PikFan	"they"?
2014-08-31 20:56:00	@PikFan	PW users?
2014-08-31 20:56:01	@Espyo	the guest
2014-08-31 20:56:05	@PikFan	oh
2014-08-31 20:56:17	@Espyo	but as usual, when these users learn about what an OP is, they instantly want to know how to be one
2014-08-31 20:56:20	@PikFan	do you know who it was?
2014-08-31 20:56:29	@PikFan	heh, yes
2014-08-31 20:56:30	@Espyo	nope
2014-08-31 20:56:36	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-31 20:56:36	@Espyo	they started by asking about the engine though
2014-08-31 20:56:44	@PikFan	ah
2014-08-31 20:56:46	@Espyo	unfortunately for them, they asked about iOS and Mac versions
2014-08-31 20:56:49	@Espyo	and I had to say no :(
2014-08-31 20:56:51	@Espyo	at least, not for now
2014-08-31 20:57:17	@PikFan	that does raise a good point
2014-08-31 20:57:30	@PikFan	how hard will it be to port the engine to iOS/Mac?
2014-08-31 20:57:38	@Espyo	Mac, probably not VERY hard
2014-08-31 20:57:44	@Espyo	I'd have to get a Mac and work on porting it
2014-08-31 20:57:49	@Espyo	Allegro does most of the work for me
2014-08-31 20:57:53	@Espyo	like interacting with the operative system
2014-08-31 20:57:56	@Espyo	and Allegro works on Mac
2014-08-31 20:57:57	@Espyo	so...
2014-08-31 20:58:02	@Espyo	I don't need to worry about changing a thing
2014-08-31 20:58:17	@Espyo	I just have to compile it on a Mac, and the same code should work the same; Allegro makes sure of it
2014-08-31 20:58:26	@PikFan	mm
2014-08-31 20:58:27	@Espyo	but still, I'd have to get my hands on one, or ask somebody to compile it for me
2014-08-31 20:58:41	@Espyo	plus I have no idea how other things work on a Mac, that might make certain things act all wrong
2014-08-31 20:58:49	@Espyo	don't think anything should go wrong, but you never know
2014-08-31 20:58:53	@Espyo	as for iPad...
2014-08-31 20:58:57	@Espyo	*iOS
2014-08-31 20:59:07	@Espyo	well, it's quite a different thing
2014-08-31 20:59:14	@Espyo	compared to a PC
2014-08-31 20:59:18	@Espyo	only a few things are the same
2014-08-31 20:59:23	@Espyo	I think Allegro has basic support for iOS
2014-08-31 20:59:28	@Espyo	so at least there's that
2014-08-31 20:59:33	@Espyo	but it'd probably take a bit of work
2014-08-31 20:59:35	@Espyo	...and headaches
2014-08-31 20:59:39	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-31 21:00:09	@PikFan	in other news, Aero's edit to [[Pikmin 3]] made me a little upset
2014-08-31 21:00:09	Testyo	"Pikmin_3" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_3
2014-08-31 21:00:18	@Espyo	didn't read much into it
2014-08-31 21:00:29	@Espyo	oh, let me just say something real quick, off-topic
2014-08-31 21:00:37	@PikFan	he copy/pasted the PW version onto ours
2014-08-31 21:00:38	@Espyo	I hate how in Pikmin 3, you can instantly flip the character 180º
2014-08-31 21:00:51	@PikFan	hmm, why?
2014-08-31 21:00:54	@Espyo	well, I DID say that for Pikmin 3 content, you're better off just doing a straight c+p
2014-08-31 21:01:10	@Espyo	but I guess I should've said common sense also counts — our P3 page is a bit better than deserving a simple c+p
2014-08-31 21:01:14	@Espyo	we'll clean it in the future
2014-08-31 21:01:28	@Espyo	in P1 and P2, if you're facing North, and you hold the stick South
2014-08-31 21:01:35	@Espyo	your character rotates to the South
2014-08-31 21:01:38	@Espyo	while walking
2014-08-31 21:01:41	@Espyo	in P3, they just turn instantly
2014-08-31 21:01:44	@Espyo	bleh
2014-08-31 21:01:54	@PikFan	what's the issue with that?
2014-08-31 21:01:59	@Espyo	it's lack of detail
2014-08-31 21:02:06	@Espyo	could you instantly flip in real life?
2014-08-31 21:02:07	@PikFan	oh
2014-08-31 21:02:10	@Espyo	I know this isn't realistic
2014-08-31 21:02:11	@Espyo	but come on
2014-08-31 21:02:17	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-31 21:02:22	@Espyo	it's basic movement
2014-08-31 21:02:25	@PikFan	yeah, it's Nintendo being lazy
2014-08-31 21:02:32	@Espyo	if you're just teleporting and moving in straight lines...
2014-08-31 21:02:40	@Espyo	it's like you created the moving code in 5 minutes
2014-08-31 21:02:48	@Espyo	I can't remember if I told you
2014-08-31 21:02:51	@Espyo	but I have a Wii U now
2014-08-31 21:02:51	@Espyo	and P3
2014-08-31 21:02:59	@PikFan	...
2014-08-31 21:03:01	@PikFan	YAY!
2014-08-31 21:03:07	@Espyo	I guess that's a no
2014-08-31 21:03:12	@PikFan	how is P3 so far?
2014-08-31 21:03:22	@PikFan	other than the instant turnaround
2014-08-31 21:03:54	@Espyo	heh
2014-08-31 21:04:01	@Espyo	a couple of details are missing, and that makes me sad
2014-08-31 21:04:02	@Espyo	laziness
2014-08-31 21:04:09	@Espyo	but I can see the game had some love put to it anyway
2014-08-31 21:04:34	@Espyo	like the game showing you the loose Pikmin number at the end of the day, as well as highlighting the safe zone
2014-08-31 21:04:57	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-31 21:05:18	@PikFan	the safe zone in the previous games were a bit ambiguous
2014-08-31 21:05:39	@Espyo	oh, and pressing A once to auto-pluck
2014-08-31 21:05:42	@Espyo	instead of having to mash A
2014-08-31 21:05:46	@Espyo	yeah, they were
2014-08-31 21:05:54	@Espyo	which makes me reconsider how to do safe zones in the engine
2014-08-31 21:05:56	@Espyo	...it really does
2014-08-31 21:06:07	@Espyo	like, so far, you had to specify which sections of the map counted as safe
2014-08-31 21:06:25	@Espyo	and you'd have to do that for each section on the landing site, and if your landing site's complex, that'd be boring
2014-08-31 21:06:34	@Espyo	plus, you could always forget, and then have Pikmin right near an Onion not be saved
2014-08-31 21:06:35	@Espyo	etc.
2014-08-31 21:06:46	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-31 21:06:47	@Espyo	but using a simple radius system... that's probably a LOT better
2014-08-31 21:07:03	@PikFan	how far are you?
2014-08-31 21:07:11	@Espyo	day 4 or such
2014-08-31 21:07:14	@Espyo	no Charlie yet
2014-08-31 21:07:17	@Espyo	uh, 3 fruits
2014-08-31 21:07:21	@Espyo	I'm taking my time with this
2014-08-31 21:07:21	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-31 21:07:24	@Espyo	just enjoying the ride
2014-08-31 21:07:40	@PikFan	so you're still in the GoH, I assume?
2014-08-31 21:07:54	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-31 21:08:01	@Espyo	...man, the more I think about the safe-zone circle method
2014-08-31 21:08:10	@Espyo	the harder I want to facepalm at how incredibly better it is than what I had in mind
2014-08-31 21:08:12	@Espyo	anyway, dinner
2014-08-31 21:26:04	@Espyo	back
2014-08-31 21:26:09	@Espyo	but yeah, some details are sadly missing
2014-08-31 21:26:12	@Espyo	some new ones are awesome
2014-08-31 21:26:17	@Espyo	but overall, I'm enjoying it
2014-08-31 21:26:25	@PikFan	that's great
2014-08-31 21:26:27	@Espyo	I'm not playing with a mindset of "this will be even better than P2"
2014-08-31 21:26:35	@Espyo	but I'm still playing it and enjoying it
2014-08-31 21:26:53	@Espyo	...I can't help but think about engine- and Pikipedia-related stuff while playing though lol
2014-08-31 21:26:55	@PikFan	probably my favorite feature is the Go here function
2014-08-31 21:27:01	@PikFan	hehehe
2014-08-31 21:27:08	@Espyo	like "wow, I could do this and that to reproduce that into the engine!"
2014-08-31 21:27:30	@Espyo	"hey, we need to point that down for the wiki"
2014-08-31 21:27:41	@PikFan	also, I'm thinking of reworking bridges in my fan game
2014-08-31 21:27:44	@Espyo	I really want to try to lose those thoughts and focus on living the game
2014-08-31 21:27:45	@Espyo	but nooo
2014-08-31 21:27:55	@Espyo	how so?
2014-08-31 21:28:13	@PikFan	I want to make them like P3 bridges — made of fragments
2014-08-31 21:28:35	@PikFan	because with fragments, there are tons of things you could do
2014-08-31 21:28:36	@Espyo	ah
2014-08-31 21:28:44	@Espyo	hm, how so?
2014-08-31 21:28:49	@PikFan	instead of having a simple log
2014-08-31 21:28:57	@PikFan	like
2014-08-31 21:29:10	@PikFan	sometimes, fragments are hidden away in dirt mounds
2014-08-31 21:29:17	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-31 21:29:34	@PikFan	or you have to think of a way to get to them, like exploiting bouncy mushrooms or bloominous stemples
2014-08-31 21:29:39	@Espyo	right
2014-08-31 21:29:41	@Espyo	good thinking
2014-08-31 21:29:55	@Espyo	off-topic, at what times in the Pikmin series do you have to button-mash to do something?
2014-08-31 21:30:07	@PikFan	plucking, that's for sure
2014-08-31 21:30:07	@Espyo	(yes, this is related to what I asked before about twirling to get back up in P3)
2014-08-31 21:30:10	@Espyo	((to which you didn't reply))
2014-08-31 21:30:22	@PikFan	((I kind of did))
2014-08-31 21:31:07	@PikFan	12:54	Espyo	can you get up on your own? and when does it happen? every time you're knocked to the ground, or just specific attacks?
2014-08-31 21:31:11	@Espyo	((partially))
2014-08-31 21:31:31	@PikFan	it happens when you get knocked back by a powerful attack
2014-08-31 21:31:55	@PikFan	or if you get paralyzed by electricity
2014-08-31 21:32:03	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-08-31 21:32:06	@PikFan	well, I'm not so sure about that
2014-08-31 21:32:27	@Espyo	and if you don't twirl, you get up on your own a bit after, right?
2014-08-31 21:32:32	@PikFan	I DO know that in Bingo Battle, if you get struck by lightning, you're paralyzed, and have to rotate the stick
2014-08-31 21:32:33	@PikFan	nope
2014-08-31 21:32:41	@Espyo	you just lie down forever?
2014-08-31 21:32:42	@Espyo	hm
2014-08-31 21:32:49	@PikFan	it's a bit silly
2014-08-31 21:35:18	@Espyo	but yeah, other reasons to mash buttons?
2014-08-31 21:36:56	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-31 21:37:16	@PikFan	let's see
2014-08-31 21:37:35	@PikFan	throwing, obviously
2014-08-31 21:38:28	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2014-08-31 21:38:38	@Espyo	hm
2014-08-31 21:39:59	@PikFan	other than throwing, plucking and rotating stick, no, I don't think so
2014-08-31 21:40:17	@PikFan	brb, food
2014-08-31 21:40:37	@Espyo	hmm, all right

2014-09-01 21:12:50	@PikFan	that could work
2014-09-01 21:12:55	@PikFan	given you're British
2014-09-01 21:14:17	@J	what
2014-09-01 21:14:35	@PikFan	...don't British people go "eh"?
2014-09-01 21:14:46	@PikFan	("eh" sounds like "ey")
2014-09-01 21:15:00	@PikFan	meh, nevermind

2014-09-01 21:17:21	@PikFan	gah, Aero, you're giving me a headache
2014-09-01 21:17:41	@PikFan	poor thing though, he's probably lost

2014-09-01 21:18:29	@PikFan	also, why why why why WHY are you using the treasure infobox >_>
2014-09-01 21:18:43	@PikFan	we have {{Template:Infobox fruit}} for a reason

2014-09-01 21:22:20	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-01 21:22:50	@PikFan	I like the concept of clicking on the treasure's icon, but scrolling would take a ridiculously long time
2014-09-01 21:22:56	@J	I seem to remember Espyo doing something similar a while back, but I can't find it
2014-09-01 21:22:59	@PikFan	there must be a way to shorten it

2014-09-01 21:46:22	@PikFan	I was thinking of editing, say, {{Notes:Crimson Banquet/brittany}}, dividing the versions with a line, and marking each one

2014-09-01 21:49:55	@Espyo	we should do the region note separations like we have on some treasures, maybe

2014-09-01 21:50:09	@J	I remember now
2014-09-01 21:51:22	@PikFan	ok, so should we add a new parameter, brittanye?

2014-09-01 21:53:05	@PikFan	brittany will be for Amercian notes, brittanye for European
2014-09-01 21:53:14	@J	is that's how it's done for treasures?

2014-09-01 21:55:05	@PikFan	this is Pikmin 3
2014-09-01 21:55:14	@J	look at the template documentation
2014-09-01 21:55:17	@PikFan	why would there be an NPC! version
2014-09-01 21:55:30	@J	you may as well ask what if we miss out some categories on new pages
2014-09-01 21:55:59	@J	I do think it's better to have each Notes: page be exactly one entry
2014-09-01 21:56:14	@PikFan	I agree
2014-09-01 21:56:15	@J	otherwise, for example, trying to wrap it in formatting gets trickier
2014-09-01 21:56:33	@J	and keeping the formatting consistent is a pain
2014-09-01 22:02:01	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Drone_Supplies like this
2014-09-01 22:02:30	@PikFan	that looks ugly

2014-09-01 22:05:57	@J	what extra formatting?
2014-09-01 22:06:37	@J	so yeah, we should add a European version for Brittany's notes, if they differ
2014-09-01 22:06:52	@J	same for Olimar's Journal, by the looks of it
2014-09-01 22:07:00	@J	I think eu might be a clearer suffix than e
2014-09-01 22:07:14	@PikFan	hmm
2014-09-01 22:07:22	@Espyo	I thought we didn't need no suffix
2014-09-01 22:07:24	@PikFan	yep, stuff broke http://www.pikminwiki.com/Crimson_Banquet
2014-09-01 22:07:29	@Espyo	because /brittany would have both versions in one
2014-09-01 22:07:40	@PikFan	I want it to be exactly like http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cupid%27s_Grenade
2014-09-01 22:07:50	@PikFan	but /how/

2014-09-01 22:08:23	@J	*disagree
2014-09-01 22:08:33	@J	[21:55:59] @J I do think it's better to have each Notes: page be exactly one entry
2014-09-01 22:08:33	@J	[21:56:14] @PikFan I agree
2014-09-01 22:08:49	@Espyo	I thought the reasons were pro-merge
2014-09-01 22:08:50	@PikFan	I thought you meant have it all in one
2014-09-01 22:08:56	@J	why?
2014-09-01 22:09:00	@J	[21:56:15] @J otherwise, for example, trying to wrap it in formatting gets trickier
2014-09-01 22:09:00	@J	[21:56:33] @J and keeping the formatting consistent is a pain
2014-09-01 22:09:06	@Espyo	I read that like having all entries in one page
2014-09-01 22:09:08	@Espyo	the exact opposite
2014-09-01 22:09:15	@PikFan	what Espyo said
2014-09-01 22:09:17	@Espyo	yeah, I wouldn't mind
2014-09-01 22:09:24	@Espyo	but it's just that we WILL forget one
2014-09-01 22:09:35	@Espyo	if Brittany has EVERY dialog different, then we'll notice it eventually
2014-09-01 22:09:37	@J	not sure how 'exactly one' means 'all'
2014-09-01 22:09:39	@Espyo	but for stuff like NPC! changes
2014-09-01 22:09:41	@Espyo	we WILL forget
2014-09-01 22:09:45	@Espyo	we forgot one?
2014-09-01 22:10:16	@J	yeah, sure, we'll forget
2014-09-01 22:10:18	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Notes:Crimson Banquet/bri... by PikFan23 (+150 bleh, I'm making way too many edits. Adding European version (though stuff might...) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Notes:Crimson_Banquet/brittany&curid=9320&diff=137960&oldid=77724
2014-09-01 22:10:28	@J	that doesn't mean we should settle for a worse way of doing it
2014-09-01 22:10:39	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-01 22:10:41	@Espyo	but forgetting
2014-09-01 22:10:44	@Espyo	what are we fighting for
2014-09-01 22:10:48	@Espyo	if it all goes to waste
2014-09-01 22:10:56	@J	content mistakes can be easily rectified; design mistakes can't
2014-09-01 22:11:08	@J	mm, probably 'implementation' rather than 'content' there
2014-09-01 22:11:43	@Espyo	but the problem is that nobody is really aware of different text in NPC! unless they actively find it
2014-09-01 22:11:57	@Espyo	Brittany's EU text, sure, if all text is different
2014-09-01 22:12:01	@Espyo	but NPC! changes are far and few
2014-09-01 22:12:05	@Espyo	all right, here's what I mean
2014-09-01 22:12:12	@Espyo	do we have ANY other page use /blablanpc?
2014-09-01 22:12:17	@Espyo	right now?
2014-09-01 22:12:20	@J	yeah
2014-09-01 22:12:28	@J	...wait, no
2014-09-01 22:13:08	@Espyo	so just that Cupid's Grenade

2014-09-01 22:17:37	@J	anyway, I would suggest that at the least we have a template to put in dual Notes: pages to keep the formatting consistent, but that has exactly the same problems as using separate pages
2014-09-01 22:21:50	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-01 22:31:28	@Espyo	Testyo's complaining that the wiki's slow
2014-09-01 22:31:46	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-09-01 22:36:21	@Espyo	he couldn't fetch the updates last time he tried
2014-09-01 22:36:32	@PikFan	weird
2014-09-01 22:38:38	@Espyo	either the wiki really is slow
2014-09-01 22:38:56	@Espyo	or my ISP deserves a slap with a nail on a wooden board

2014-09-05 20:16:29	@J	so you still have nothing to do?
2014-09-05 20:17:36	@Espyo	I do now, but they're pretty relaxed with stuff like Skype and IRC
2014-09-05 20:18:22	@J	mm, just seems a bit weird
2014-09-05 20:18:29	@J	I mean, we use IRC at work _for_ work
2014-09-05 20:19:44	@J	hey, does Testyo store chat logs?
2014-09-05 20:22:48	@Espyo	we use Skype at work for work

2014-09-05 21:48:25	@J	maybe
2014-09-05 21:48:44	@J	try and find one, then I can hide them
2014-09-05 21:49:01	@J	you could just start using /query instead
2014-09-05 21:49:15	@Espyo	requires switching tabs, bad
2014-09-05 21:49:58	@J	you don't have keyboard shortcuts for that?
2014-09-05 21:50:16	@Espyo	no, it requires going to a new tab to read it

2014-09-05 21:56:55	@J	wait, no idea what you're saying
2014-09-05 21:57:02	@J	[21:50:21] @Espyo typing is easy, yeah
2014-09-05 21:57:45	@J	(moved it to http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/stuff/irc-logs/pikipedia/)
2014-09-05 21:58:02	@J	well, notice me now and I'll things
2014-09-05 22:00:28	@Espyo	typing "/query J bleh" is easy
2014-09-05 22:00:36	@Espyo	you having to go to a different tab to see it, and then back here is not
2014-09-05 22:00:41	@Espyo	same goes for me if you decide to repl
2014-09-05 22:00:42	@Espyo	*y
2014-09-05 22:01:28	@J	but I wanted a notice to search for it in the logs
2014-09-05 22:01:38	@Espyo	but I did notice you
2014-09-05 22:01:49	@J	oh, it doesn't show up here, then
2014-09-05 22:01:53	@J	just in the server tab
2014-09-05 22:01:56	@Espyo	...
2014-09-05 22:02:03	@Espyo	I hate that part of Mibbit
2014-09-05 22:02:08	@Espyo	luckily HexChat doesn't do that
2014-09-05 22:02:12	@J	Mibbit?
2014-09-05 22:02:17	@Espyo	still stupidly puts it on the PM tab, but only if it's open
2014-09-05 22:02:22	@Espyo	mhm, back when I used Mibbit
2014-09-05 22:02:35	@J	mm, I think the separation makes sense
2014-09-05 22:02:39	@Espyo	notices would go on the server tab if I had focus on another server's channel when I got the notice
2014-09-05 22:02:50	@J	and hey, in this situation it's good news, because I don't need to do any filtering
2014-09-05 22:02:59	@Espyo	yeah, I guess
2014-09-05 22:03:07	@Espyo	oh, but see, here's the thing
2014-09-05 22:03:11	@Espyo	must be an oversight, but
2014-09-05 22:03:23	@J	so anyway, that starts from when I stopped quitting every day
2014-09-05 22:03:24	@Espyo	HexChat highlights the PM window... with a "server message" color
2014-09-05 22:03:29	@Espyo	instead of a "someone said stuff" color
2014-09-05 22:03:31	@J	and it should update every 3 days
2014-09-05 22:03:36	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-09-05 22:03:40	@Espyo	but WHY do we need it?
2014-09-05 22:03:44	@J	Iunnno
2014-09-05 22:03:46	@J	*-n
2014-09-05 22:03:47	@J	why not
2014-09-05 22:03:51	@Espyo	privacy!
2014-09-05 22:03:57	@J	it's a public chat room
2014-09-05 22:03:59	@Espyo	sure, the NSA is always on to us
2014-09-05 22:04:06	@Espyo	but we bad-talk other people here
2014-09-05 22:04:08	@Espyo	what if they see the logs
2014-09-05 22:04:10	@Espyo	like...
2014-09-05 22:04:13	@J	anyone else can do exactly the same thing
2014-09-05 22:04:14	@Espyo	...wikia
2014-09-05 22:04:30	@Espyo	anyway, these logs add up
2014-09-05 22:04:31	@J	Darkmyst can do it if they want
2014-09-05 22:04:43	@Espyo	before you know it, they're like 500 M
2014-09-05 22:04:43	Testyo	500 m = 546.8 yd / 1640.4 ft / 26315.8 Olimar-heights
2014-09-05 22:04:53	@Espyo	that's a lot of Olimars
2014-09-05 22:05:04	@J	this is almost a yeah of logs, and it's about 5M
2014-09-05 22:05:05	Testyo	5 m = 5.468 yd / 16.404 ft / 263.158 Olimar-heights
2014-09-05 22:05:12	@Espyo	>a yeah of logs
2014-09-05 22:05:15	@Espyo	funnier than it should've been
2014-09-05 22:05:23	@Espyo	really? no way
2014-09-05 22:05:25	@J	84000 lines
2014-09-05 22:05:30	@J	...
2014-09-05 22:05:32	@Espyo	my HexChat logs are shorter than a year and they're at least 30
2014-09-05 22:05:34	@J	I am silly
2014-09-05 22:05:40	@J	*yeah
2014-09-05 22:05:50	@Espyo	 23 M
2014-09-05 22:05:50	Testyo	23 m = 25.1528 yd / 75.4584 ft / 1210.53 Olimar-heights
2014-09-05 22:05:51	@J	hmm, maybe yours stores more stuff?
2014-09-05 22:05:54	@Espyo	well, it's more than just Pikipedia
2014-09-05 22:06:02	@J	yeah
2014-09-05 22:06:02	@Espyo	DarkMyst is 3 M
2014-09-05 22:06:02	Testyo	3 m = 3.2808 yd / 9.8424 ft / 157.895 Olimar-heights
2014-09-05 22:06:03	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-05 22:06:13	@Espyo	#pikipedia is just 1
2014-09-05 22:06:21	@Espyo	...how can that be if this is the only real channel I use here
2014-09-05 22:06:24	@Espyo	#Testyo is always dead
2014-09-05 22:06:29	@Espyo	brb
2014-09-05 22:06:35	@J	my full log goes back to February 2011 and is 15M
2014-09-05 22:06:36	Testyo	15 m = 16.404 yd / 49.212 ft / 789.474 Olimar-heights
2014-09-05 22:07:06	@J	plenty of breathing room for those Olimars
2014-09-05 22:08:05	@J	but yeah, every now and then people ask about logs for something that happened
2014-09-05 22:08:13	@J	all future problems solved
2014-09-05 22:10:30	@J	now I'm wishing I'd preserved my Pidgin logs from forever ago, just so I had even more years of #pikipedia on file
2014-09-05 22:10:55	@Espyo	I guess
2014-09-05 22:11:00	@Espyo	oh hey
2014-09-05 22:11:02	@Espyo	I remember Pidgin
2014-09-05 22:12:36	@J	hmm, I didn't realise you'd been around that long
2014-09-05 22:12:54	@J	I guess I stopped using it when those logs started, almost 4 years ago

2014-09-06 13:15:43	@Espyo	ooh, Allegro 5.1 adds support to Android
2014-09-06 13:15:48	@Espyo	it's being developed as a branch of 5.0, the one I'm using
2014-09-06 13:16:03	@Espyo	well, now I just need time, and we can have the engine on Android
2014-09-06 13:19:38	@J	well, that was true before
2014-09-06 13:20:43	@Espyo	probably was
2014-09-06 13:20:51	@Espyo	I just never bothered to check before because I only now got an Android
2014-09-06 13:20:57	@Espyo	...tablet
2014-09-06 13:21:04	@Espyo	it's like saying "I just now got a Linux"
2014-09-06 13:21:11	@Espyo	so I had to add the tablet to the end
2014-09-06 13:23:46	@J	I mean, even if Allegro never supported X platform, you'd still just need time
2014-09-06 13:24:47	@Espyo	unless they eventually abandoned Allegro
2014-09-06 13:24:51	@Espyo	it's starting to swerve that way
2014-09-06 13:25:00	@Espyo	they are each time less enthusiastic about working on Allegro
2014-09-06 13:25:02	@Espyo	it's only natural
2014-09-06 13:28:08	@J	but even then it's just time, because you can switch to a different engine
2014-09-06 13:29:35	@Espyo	hm, but I meant all Allegro
2014-09-06 13:29:41	@Espyo	and all Pikmin fangame engine
2014-09-06 13:29:56	@Espyo	I could use another engine in the future
2014-09-06 13:29:58	@Espyo	but honestly, would I?
2014-09-06 13:30:13	@Espyo	barely have time to even touch PFE to begin with, much less port it to another framework
2014-09-06 13:30:27	@Espyo	(I meant framework ("I could use another framework in the future"))
2014-09-06 13:43:39	@J	I was just picking on your wording
2014-09-06 13:44:36	@J	so anyway, how's work now you're not doing nothing?

2014-09-06 13:48:14	@Espyo	we're still doing boring tests
2014-09-06 13:48:29	@Espyo	but I'm now passing them from our informal memos to the official docs
2014-09-06 13:48:47	@Espyo	then they showed me the ropes for how to use VectorCAST, which we'll need to use to run the tests with

2014-09-06 13:55:10	@J	hmm, where I work they recently hired one person per team to be devoted to automated testing - is that what you'd say your role is, or is this just where you're starting?
2014-09-06 14:11:53	@Espyo	it's everybody's role in this project
2014-09-06 14:12:01	@Espyo	we got the ship display screen from a Canadian company
2014-09-06 14:12:12	@Espyo	and we're tasked with completing their test case list, and run the tests
2014-09-06 14:12:20	@Espyo	and then report passes and failures to the company
2014-09-06 14:12:32	@Espyo	so they can fix it and send us again, until there are no more failed test cases
2014-09-06 14:17:08	@J	right
2014-09-06 14:17:32	@J	yeah, we used to have a separate QA team in another country, but they decided it was awkward
2014-09-06 14:17:48	@J	both because of the distance, and because it wasn't continuous QA, but done in batches like you just described
2014-09-06 14:19:37	@Espyo	yeah, we can already see how horrible this is
2014-09-06 14:19:52	@Espyo	...specially because the client can't answer questions for their life
2014-09-06 14:20:16	@Espyo	at one point, one test states that some flag should be set in case any of the following fire twice in 10 minutes: A B
2014-09-06 14:20:40	@Espyo	having A triggering twice in 10 seconds should obviously set the flag
2014-09-06 14:20:48	@Espyo	but what about triggering A once and B once?
2014-09-06 14:20:50	@Espyo	the text isn't clear
2014-09-06 14:20:53	@Espyo	so we asked a question
2014-09-06 14:21:07	@Espyo	their reply after way too long? "Yes, that's correct. It's two in ten seconds."
2014-09-06 14:28:47	@J	I think you mixed up minutes and seconds at some point
2014-09-06 14:29:16	@Espyo	it was all seconds
2014-09-06 14:29:18	@Espyo	yeah, I did, oops

2014-09-06 17:13:08	@PikFan	I only complain about you violating our privacy
2014-09-06 17:13:12	@PikFan	ages 14 to 18
2014-09-06 17:14:07	@Espyo	ah
2014-09-06 17:14:35	@PikFan	(of course, I'm joking about the logs)

2014-09-06 17:16:59	@J	yeah, I got that
2014-09-06 17:17:18	@J	so that's 3 years?
2014-09-06 17:17:22	@J	is it all compulsory?
2014-09-06 17:19:51	@PikFan	4 years
2014-09-06 17:19:59	@PikFan	but you can graduate early
2014-09-06 17:23:15	@J	so the last year finishes at age 19?
2014-09-06 17:23:44	@PikFan	if you get held back a year, yes
2014-09-06 17:24:14	@PikFan	for me, I'll be 15 by the end of my 9th grade

2014-09-09 22:07:05	@J	sure, go with that
2014-09-09 22:07:35	@J	'one can tell' is a bit weird, though
2014-09-09 22:08:02	@J	it's not like that stuff implies the first statement
2014-09-09 22:08:12	@J	hardly an implication, more of an explanation
2014-09-09 22:08:37	@J	also, I assume you're not planning to end it with 'in the form of ty'
2014-09-09 22:09:15	@J	new HIB
2014-09-09 22:10:03	@J	it has Papers Please, Prison Architect, Gunpoint
2014-09-09 22:10:50	@Espyo	hey, that's one of the best HIBs I've seen
2014-09-09 22:10:53	@Espyo	if only I had mon--
2014-09-09 22:10:55	@Espyo	...right
2014-09-09 22:11:01	@Espyo	well, but I don't have time
2014-09-09 22:11:19	@Espyo	or the patience to have to go through a convoluted system just to get my Portuguese money into their American banking system
2014-09-09 22:12:02	@Espyo	all right, when you work with wikis for long enough, you know you can get away with anything subjective by typing a single word
2014-09-09 22:12:05	@Espyo	"arguably"
2014-09-09 22:12:16	@Espyo	hey, I should pitch this as a comic idea for XKCD
2014-09-09 22:15:34	@J	I don't think I've ever seen them do a 'pay more than' as high as $10 before
2014-09-09 22:15:34	Testyo	$ 10 = 7.372 € / £ 6.305 
2014-09-09 22:15:46	@J	I think they're usually around $5
2014-09-09 22:15:46	Testyo	$ 5 = 3.686 € / £ 3.1525 
2014-09-09 22:16:02	@J	it really does seem to have successfully pushed up the average
2014-09-09 22:16:07	@Espyo	I've seen a few 12s
2014-09-09 22:16:19	@J	though maybe that's also just that early buyers spend more
2014-09-09 22:16:20	@Espyo	well, loads of people know about Papers, Please
2014-09-09 22:16:23	@Espyo	and love it, too

2014-09-09 22:16:33	@Espyo	Prison Architect also created a lotta hype
2014-09-09 22:17:14	@J	Gunpoint is the biggest selling point for me
2014-09-09 22:17:37	@J	I'd definitely end up buying it anyway, but I'm tempted to go for this
2014-09-09 22:18:22	@Espyo	if you don't have the other two, go
2014-09-09 22:18:37	@Espyo	probably cheaper than what you'd get Gunpoint normally for
2014-09-09 22:19:54	@Espyo	all right, that's enough P2 vs NPC!P2
2014-09-09 22:19:56	@J	I have Papers Please
2014-09-09 22:20:03	@Espyo	I'll check the rest of the text later, using some tool
2014-09-09 22:20:14	@J	but I'm not worried about the price anyway
2014-09-09 22:20:16	@Espyo	compare GC vs NPC!, and US vs EU
2014-09-09 22:20:24	@Espyo	what about Prison Architect?
2014-09-09 22:20:33	@J	nope, but my brother has it
2014-09-09 22:20:50	@Espyo	what are the other games?
2014-09-09 22:20:50	@J	I'll check if these games exist DRM-free for Linux elsewhere
2014-09-09 22:21:04	@J	if not, all the better
2014-09-09 22:21:10	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-09 22:21:26	@J	Luftrausers, Gone Home, Hammerwatch, SteamWorld Dig
2014-09-09 22:21:34	@J	the last is the only one I hadn't heard of
2014-09-09 22:22:01	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-09 22:22:47	@J	Hammerwatch doesn't interest me, SteamWorld Dig looks like it could be fun, I say I end up disliking every adventure game but I still keep coming back to them so why not, and Luftrausers could be good - I tend to like arcade games
2014-09-09 22:26:58	@J	actually, every single one of these games is already on the Humble Store
2014-09-09 22:27:09	@J	actually, maybe they do that when they release bundles now
2014-09-09 22:27:12	@J	it would make sense
2014-09-09 22:29:05	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-09 22:29:06	@J	most indie games are on the Humble Store now, which is great

2014-09-13 12:50:08	@J	[23:52:04] @J wow
2014-09-13 12:52:05	@Espyo	I actually saw from Testyo
2014-09-13 12:52:12	@Espyo	so if you scroll the log down further...
2014-09-13 12:52:25	@Espyo	wait, that's silly
2014-09-13 12:52:36	@Espyo	for a moment I thought it was I quit, you join, Testyo quits
2014-09-13 12:52:41	@Espyo	but anyway, yeah, there was a nasty netsplit
2014-09-13 12:56:06	@Espyo	for how long did we have Bulbears in the Breadbug family article? http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Breadbug_family&curid=28&diff=138248&oldid=137804
2014-09-13 12:56:45	@Espyo	...
2014-09-13 12:56:54	@Espyo	a wikia admin caught on the split
2014-09-13 12:58:50	@J	if it was a netsplit it wouldn't say 'Leaving' as your quit message
2014-09-13 13:00:14	@Espyo	no no no
2014-09-13 13:00:19	@Espyo	the fact that you weren't here for so long
2014-09-13 13:00:24	@Espyo	guess that was ambiguous
2014-09-13 13:20:39	@J	oh, no, what happened was I changed my internet service
2014-09-13 13:20:53	@J	and there was a fault with the new service and it took them a couple of days to fix it
2014-09-13 13:22:48	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-09-13 13:22:56	@Espyo	because we've had a netsplit for like a whole day or so
2014-09-13 13:57:05	@J	oh, okay
2014-09-13 13:57:07	@J	good timing, then

2014-09-13 14:15:42	@J	wonder how Testyo feels
2014-09-13 14:16:19	@J	so I got HIB12 and played Gone Home
2014-09-13 14:16:27	@J	I think it's really good
2014-09-13 14:17:02	@J	it's not much of an adventure game in the classic 'click on all the things and combine random items' sense
2014-09-13 14:17:41	@J	more of an exploration game where you interactively discover a story
2014-09-13 14:18:01	@J	kind of like all the lore and backstory you uncover in Metroid games
2014-09-13 14:19:11	@J	so yeah, you should play it
2014-09-13 14:19:36	@J	and it won't take much of your time - I probably took 3 hours to go through absolutely everything

2014-09-13 14:39:53	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2014-09-13 14:39:59	@Espyo	how you doing, Testyo?
2014-09-13 14:40:00	Testyo	are you going to have school on the loading time shenanigans
2014-09-13 14:40:03	@Espyo	there
2014-09-13 14:40:05	@Espyo	being quiet is stupid
2014-09-13 14:40:17	@Espyo	part of the reason I wanted him quiet was because he KEPT complaining about swears and caps lock
2014-09-13 14:40:24	@Espyo	even though we don't really do those much here, it was still annoying
2014-09-13 14:40:28	@Espyo	but I've since disabled that, so eh
2014-09-13 14:40:47	@Espyo	yeah, it's more like an exploration and discovery game
2014-09-13 14:40:51	@Espyo	it's what I know of
2014-09-13 14:41:11	@Espyo	that Plants and Fungi page, I gave the greenlight
2014-09-13 14:41:16	@Espyo	it's not a content page, it's a list page
2014-09-13 14:41:19	@Espyo	but those are good too
2014-09-13 14:41:24	@Espyo	sure, we have cats, but these list stuff too
2014-09-13 14:41:30	@Espyo	plus they're a bit like our family articles
2014-09-13 14:41:35	@Espyo	and Wikipedia has loads of list articles too
2014-09-13 15:06:51	@J	I recently played through Tiny and Big too
2014-09-13 15:07:12	@J	it gives you a load of mechanics right from the start, and the game is basically just playing around with them
2014-09-13 15:07:31	@J	cutting huge walls and mountains in half
2014-09-13 15:08:40	@J	yeah, lists are okay, so long as they add something more than a category (eg. tabular data, or short descriptions), and so long as no list pages are embedded in others
2014-09-13 15:10:24	@Espyo	yay, neat
2014-09-13 15:10:31	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-13 15:14:50	@J	and I _also_ started playing Capsized (this is what happens when I have no internet)
2014-09-13 15:15:01	@Espyo	of course
2014-09-13 15:15:08	@J	it does the same thing, giving you a load of mechanics at the start - in this case, movement mechanics
2014-09-13 15:15:48	@J	but because it's more of a linear action game rather than giving you an area to explore, I don't feel like you really get used to them early enough
2014-09-13 15:16:06	@J	and they're trickier to use because it's a faster-paced game, anyway
2014-09-13 15:16:22	@J	but I can see it feeling really good if you get used to it
2014-09-13 15:17:00	@J	you have a grappling hook, jetpack and some sort of thing that blasts you away from nearby objects/surfaces
2014-09-13 15:17:03	@Espyo	aren't they overwhelming?
2014-09-13 15:17:22	@J	yeah, that's the word I was trying to find
2014-09-13 15:17:32	@Espyo	right
2014-09-13 15:17:43	@Espyo	it's neat, but the problem is always the overwhelmingness
2014-09-13 15:18:03	@J	the tutorial introduces the blasting thing as a way of moving things around
2014-09-13 15:18:12	@J	but it's actually pretty good for movement
2014-09-13 15:18:28	@J	you just need to incorporate it into everything else
2014-09-13 15:19:14	@J	Capsized is actually different from what I expected - I was thinking it would be Metroid-like, with an open world and lots of exploration
2014-09-13 15:19:35	@J	but it's mission-based, set various small-ish, enclosed levels
2014-09-13 15:19:36	@J	...
2014-09-13 15:19:41	@J	*set in separate small-ish...
2014-09-13 15:20:01	@J	like, some you have to get to the end, some you kill some things, some you save some guys
2014-09-13 15:20:09	@Espyo	uh... I think I've seen a clip of the game at one point
2014-09-13 15:20:19	@Espyo	it's this guy that does awesome videos with his voice, he's voice acting in the game
2014-09-13 15:20:49	@J	it has a really detailed hand-drawn style - does that sound right?
2014-09-13 15:20:51	@Espyo	hm, neat
2014-09-13 15:20:52	@J	very green
2014-09-13 15:20:55	@Espyo	nope, that's not it

2014-09-13 15:21:59	@Espyo	anyway, the best game in which you use a rocket to propel is Rocket Knight Adventures, hands odwn
2014-09-13 15:22:00	@Espyo	*down
2014-09-13 15:22:47	@J	hah, I can see how you would think that's what I was talking about
2014-09-13 15:22:58	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-13 15:23:21	@J	Capsized is more of a 2D shoot-some-monsters game
2014-09-13 15:23:43	@J	the jetpack is much slower and easier to use, but fuel is limited, so you're mostly grappling
2014-09-13 15:24:01	@Espyo	right, I see
2014-09-13 15:24:25	@Espyo	looks like it was a really good HIB then

2014-09-14 20:35:00	@J	Testyo is silly
2014-09-14 20:35:01	Testyo	because that sort of whacky humor fits in the Dismiss button changes to Charge
2014-09-14 20:35:25	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-09-14 20:37:28	@Espyo	weirdest part is that it only triggers if you do like 5 messages in quick succession
2014-09-14 20:37:30	@Espyo	I only do like 4
2014-09-14 20:41:54	@Espyo	all right, on infoboxes like Red Bulborb's
2014-09-14 20:41:59	@Espyo	we have the family
2014-09-14 20:42:02	@Espyo	which links to... Breadbug
2014-09-14 20:42:03	@Espyo	the enemy
2014-09-14 20:42:14	@Espyo	and the categories are also stupid, and some names are a bit broken
2014-09-14 20:42:27	@Espyo	so I'm gonna do this: every family article and category must be called "bla bla family"
2014-09-14 20:42:33	@Espyo	that should fix everything
2014-09-14 20:42:38	@Espyo	thoughts?
2014-09-14 20:46:06	@J	you mean because it just adds 's' or something?
2014-09-14 20:46:12	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-14 20:46:14	@Espyo	breaks same names
2014-09-14 20:46:17	@Espyo	and it sounds stupid
2014-09-14 20:46:23	@J	that makes sense, or maybe 'x enemies' for clarification
2014-09-14 20:46:43	@Espyo	Breadbug enemies? Creep-crab enemies?
2014-09-14 20:46:44	@Espyo	like that?
2014-09-14 20:46:48	@J	maybe
2014-09-14 20:47:06	@J	it's more obvious what it means out of context if you don't know the family names
2014-09-14 20:47:33	@J	but I guess you can just have it clear on the category page itself
2014-09-14 20:47:39	@J	I'm fine with either
2014-09-14 20:48:19	@J	hopefully changing the template and renaming the category pages is all you have to do
2014-09-14 20:49:01	@J	might have to do action=purge (same as a blank edit) on enemy changes to make the change happen right away, else it could take a few days
2014-09-14 20:50:13	@Espyo	should be all

2014-09-16 21:23:33	@Espyo	J? you there?
2014-09-16 21:23:34	@Espyo	PikFan?
2014-09-16 21:51:24	@J	.
2014-09-16 21:58:10	@Espyo	did you check the policies?
2014-09-16 22:01:14	@J	what?
2014-09-16 22:01:42	@J	hey look, 2 games I actually wanted just got added to the HIB - The Bridge and Race The Sun
2014-09-16 22:02:36	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Policy I've updated today
2014-09-16 22:10:12	@J	looks like all the sections you changed just got wordier without adding content
2014-09-16 22:11:17	@J	'focus on the US version's info first, then the European version, and finally the Japanese version' - what does 'focus on' mean?  It's pretty vague
2014-09-16 22:12:01	@J	'as well as the spelling used by the majority of readers and editors' - not something we know to be true, and adds nothing
2014-09-16 22:12:20	@Espyo	don't be silly, I added content
2014-09-16 22:12:28	@Espyo	The Bridge... sounds familiar
2014-09-16 22:12:42	@J	it would help if your 'advanced language' example was actually English
2014-09-16 22:12:55	@Espyo	most of our readers are Americans, aren't they?
2014-09-16 22:13:02	@Espyo	maybe not editors, but I'd bet readers
2014-09-16 22:13:09	@J	'bet' being the key word
2014-09-16 22:13:18	@Espyo	focus on as in giving the information on the US version first, then EU, then JP
2014-09-16 22:13:29	@Espyo	well, we have stats, we can check
2014-09-16 22:13:36	@J	as in order on the page?
2014-09-16 22:13:41	@J	because if so, it's not clear at all
2014-09-16 22:14:54	@J	could move the image section to help:files, which is already linked at the top of this page
2014-09-16 22:17:23	@J	I personally don't like 'they' as you describe, but Wikipedia says it's okay in US English, so I guess I don't care
2014-09-16 22:23:06	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-16 22:23:10	@Espyo	thought it was clear...
2014-09-16 22:23:23	@Espyo	everything is ok
2014-09-16 22:23:27	@Espyo	and because nobody can decide
2014-09-16 22:23:31	@Espyo	we might as well go with "they"
2014-09-16 22:23:35	@Espyo	better than a neutral "he"
2014-09-16 22:23:41	@Espyo	or doing "he/she" every time
2014-09-16 22:23:49	@Espyo	"he/she" is just... so darn awkward
2014-09-16 22:23:49	@Espyo	gleh
2014-09-16 22:26:55	@J	I swear I saw a typo, but now I can't find it
2014-09-16 22:30:25	@J	'Exceptions to the "you" rule are in walkthrough sections in articles, which normally refer to the player as "you"'
2014-09-16 22:30:26	@J	really?
2014-09-16 22:32:20	@J	so yeah, fix that flora sentence; I'm not even sure what you were going for there

2014-09-16 22:36:07	@Espyo	"really?" what?
2014-09-16 22:36:29	@Espyo	the flora sentence is meant to show a way to word the other sentence that uses overly advanced words

2014-09-16 22:52:25	@J	mm, I just thought we always said 2nd person nowhere but user guides
2014-09-16 22:53:12	@J	it's not like I disagree, really, it just came out of nowhere
2014-09-16 22:53:15	@J	[22:36:29] @Espyo the flora sentence is meant to show a way to word the other sentence that uses overly advanced words
2014-09-16 22:53:17	@J	yeah, I know
2014-09-16 22:53:21	@J	but what does it even mean
2014-09-16 22:53:33	@J	what's a segmented?
2014-09-16 23:05:18	@Espyo	wha
2014-09-16 23:05:23	@Espyo	use "you" everywhere except guides?
2014-09-16 23:05:30	@Espyo	that's the most insane thing I've ever heard coming from you
2014-09-16 23:05:44	@Espyo	where did I use "segmented"?
2014-09-16 23:05:48	@Espyo	did I accidentally a word?
2014-09-16 23:06:45	@J	you accidentallied all over the place
2014-09-16 23:06:58	@J	uh
2014-09-16 23:06:59	@J	...
2014-09-16 23:07:01	@J	the opposite
2014-09-16 23:07:24	@J	'nowhere' != 'everywhere'
2014-09-16 23:07:43	@J	and also 'user'
2014-09-16 23:07:49	@Espyo	oh, thought so
2014-09-16 23:07:52	@Espyo	what "user"?
2014-09-16 23:08:04	@Espyo	err
2014-09-16 23:08:08	@Espyo	I meant "the flora in this segment"
2014-09-16 23:08:19	@Espyo	dunno, got any fancier word for "part"?
2014-09-16 23:16:19	@J	user guides = Guide: namespace
2014-09-16 23:16:39	@Espyo	uh-huh?

2014-09-17 17:24:06	@Espyo	hmm, probably
2014-09-17 17:24:38	@Espyo	turns out their pages weren't THAT overly complete
2014-09-17 17:24:43	@Espyo	some are missing guides, for instance
2014-09-17 17:24:55	@Espyo	also loads of them need cleaning up

2014-09-17 17:25:28	Prezintenden	yeah that sounds like something i could do

2014-09-17 17:27:28	Prezintenden	japanese and some math/chemistry... well, uh. courses that basically make sure you dont fail miserbaly in the actual chem/math course
2014-09-17 17:27:47	Prezintenden	i'm sure they have a fancy name
2014-09-17 17:29:18	@Espyo	complementary, I'm guessing

2014-09-17 17:30:01	@Espyo	anyway, try to be pro at Japanese
2014-09-17 17:30:06	Prezintenden	in german it's propädeutikum
2014-09-17 17:30:08	Prezintenden	beautiful
2014-09-17 17:30:23	@Espyo	'cause I'm really starting to doubt that the Scaly Custard's Japanese name is Crocodile Scrotum

2014-09-17 17:31:22	@Espyo	"Crocodile" is clearly part of the word
2014-09-17 17:31:26	@Espyo	but scrotum... not really seeing it
2014-09-17 17:31:40	@Espyo	there's a part that LOOKS like it, but part of the word is also part of crocodile

2014-09-17 19:27:04	@Espyo	like, say, the Burgeoning Spiderwort variant in caves
2014-09-17 19:27:12	@J	the MIDI music?
2014-09-17 19:27:15	@Espyo	there are no BS underground, but they could've added anyway
2014-09-17 19:27:16	@Espyo	yeah, MIDI
2014-09-17 19:27:40	@Espyo	plus, the Whiskerpillars DO have a poko count on the Piklopedia
2014-09-17 19:45:00	Prezintenden	so uh
2014-09-17 19:45:30	Prezintenden	from what i could tell it says alligator/lizard/etc. no testicle
2014-09-17 19:45:36	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-09-17 19:45:37	Prezintenden	so testicle of alligator
2014-09-17 19:45:43	@Espyo	wait
2014-09-17 19:45:55	@Espyo	"no testicle" as in "testicle of", or as in "there is no such word as testicle in the name"
2014-09-17 19:46:04	@Espyo	'cause I know "no" in Japanese means "of"
2014-09-17 19:46:10	@Espyo	unless I'm crazy
2014-09-17 19:46:13	Prezintenden	yes
2014-09-17 19:46:32	Prezintenden	the thing that you think you are right about, that is
2014-09-17 19:48:10	Prezintenden	it's a bit stupid because it's katakana and most words can mean pretty much anything if you dont know what to look for
2014-09-17 19:48:46	Prezintenden	I'm a bit reluctant though to write it down and ask my poor sweet middle aged japanese teacher if she can tell me if it means what i think it means
2014-09-17 19:54:43	@Espyo	yay
2014-09-17 19:54:52	@Espyo	HAH
2014-09-17 19:54:54	@Espyo	yeah, I hear you
2014-09-17 19:55:00	@Espyo	but I'll ask the guy who originally added that
2014-09-17 19:55:04	@Espyo	...if this is wrong...
2014-09-17 19:55:08	@Espyo	the entire internet knows about it
2014-09-17 19:55:23	@Espyo	on one hand, cool, because I plan on writing an article about misconceptions
2014-09-17 19:55:39	@Espyo	stuff like people thinking the name is "smokEy progg", or people thinking the Ujadani stop after day 300
2014-09-17 19:55:52	@Espyo	then I could add this, people thinking the fruit means crocodile scrotum
2014-09-17 19:55:54	@Espyo	but on the other hand
2014-09-17 19:56:00	@Espyo	the ENTIRE internet now knows something wrong
2014-09-17 20:06:22	@Espyo	guess it's legit
2014-09-17 20:06:33	Prezintenden	what makes you say that
2014-09-17 20:06:49	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/scrotum.txt
2014-09-17 20:06:55	@Espyo	this is from the TCRF chatroom
2014-09-17 20:08:06	@Espyo	and the did you know gaming post DOES also say that they asked somebody else for confirmation
2014-09-17 20:08:38	Prezintenden	wuh
2014-09-17 20:08:46	Prezintenden	japanese is weird
2014-09-17 20:09:02	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-09-17 20:10:05	Prezintenden	so, smart as i am, i googled フグリ, and ended up at 精巣
2014-09-17 20:10:20	Prezintenden	which you will notice differs from 陰嚢
2014-09-17 20:10:34	Prezintenden	one being testicle, the other scrotum
2014-09-17 20:10:53	Prezintenden	scrotum making more sense, but testicle being the first results i got... eh
2014-09-17 20:11:43	Prezintenden	i mean the guy said there's some overlap
2014-09-17 20:11:46	Prezintenden	but
2014-09-17 20:11:47	@Espyo	ah
2014-09-17 20:11:57	Prezintenden	you'd think there wouldnt be because... why
2014-09-17 20:12:46	Prezintenden	jesus christ it was on didyouknowgaming
2014-09-17 20:12:53	Prezintenden	that thing is a ticking timebomb
2014-09-17 20:14:06	@Espyo	yeah..
2014-09-17 20:14:07	Prezintenden	oh boy, onyomi and kunyomi. i dont know anything about that stuff
2014-09-17 20:14:08	@Espyo	*.
2014-09-17 20:30:30	@Espyo	gaaaaah
2014-09-17 20:30:37	@Espyo	at one point, I was trying... SOMETHING on Pikmin 2
2014-09-17 20:30:42	@Espyo	and ran across two glitches instead
2014-09-17 20:30:49	@Espyo	I took screenshots, but I can't remember how they happened
2014-09-17 20:30:54	@Espyo	so this is all for naught
2014-09-17 20:32:23	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Dolphin%202014-07-15%2000-11-43-58.png https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Dolphin%202014-07-15%2000-09-21-11.png
2014-09-17 20:53:53	Prezintenden	wow I've never seen the first one happen
2014-09-17 20:54:59	@J	what's the first one meant to show?
2014-09-17 20:55:17	@J	uh, I mean the second one
2014-09-17 20:55:40	@J	is it that the Pikmin isn't drowning and isn't responding to being whistled?
2014-09-17 21:03:33	Prezintenden	it's the usual stuck-under-bridge-until-you-push-it-out glitch i think
2014-09-17 21:05:31	@J	I thought I got that when a Wollywog landed on a Pikmin on a bridge
2014-09-17 21:14:03	@Espyo	that Purple is on the water, without dying
2014-09-17 21:15:41	@Espyo	uh, I think it didn't respond to whistles
2014-09-17 21:20:07	@Espyo	meanwhile, I still can't remember seeing a GameCube controller diagram in P2
2014-09-17 21:21:50	<--	Prezintenden (Mibbit@95.91.jjx.tju) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2014-09-17 21:38:02	@Espyo	the hell
2014-09-17 21:38:26	@Espyo	the chances of one person from Portugal starring the yaz0 Python decoder project on GitHub is low
2014-09-17 21:38:34	@Espyo	because in Portugal, GameCube is kinda not a thing
2014-09-17 21:38:38	@Espyo	but the chances of TWO people doing it?

2014-09-17 21:57:11	@J	check what, exactly?
2014-09-17 21:58:22	@Espyo	if they work, really
2014-09-17 21:58:26	@Espyo	and if the text file makes sense
2014-09-17 21:58:37	@Espyo	I typed half of it while talking on Skype, so chances are I broke everything
2014-09-17 21:59:04	@J	can't you check they work?
2014-09-17 21:59:24	@Espyo	I know they work for me
2014-09-17 21:59:34	@Espyo	I'm meant to share this with other people, wanna see if they work on other machines

2014-09-17 22:07:05	@J	*got distracted*
2014-09-17 22:07:08	@J	mm, okay
2014-09-17 22:07:24	@J	well, to start with, it's generally good practice to manually word-wrap text files
2014-09-17 22:07:46	@J	and also some of the other readmes use different line endings, might want to make them consistent
2014-09-17 22:11:05	@Espyo	aren't they consistent?
2014-09-17 22:11:13	@Espyo	don't tell me I have unix and windows line endings mixed
2014-09-17 22:11:54	@J	yeah, you do
2014-09-17 22:11:58	@J	I'm opening in Notepad here
2014-09-17 22:12:06	@J	I mean, these aren't your text files
2014-09-17 22:12:15	@J	but if you expect Windows people to use them, you might want to convert
2014-09-17 22:12:29	@Espyo	how
2014-09-17 22:12:29	@J	first issue: GCR doesn't render Japanese characters properly
2014-09-17 22:12:31	@Espyo	how even
2014-09-17 22:12:36	@Espyo	oh yeah, those aren't mine
2014-09-17 22:12:43	@Espyo	yeah, it never did
2014-09-17 22:12:57	@Espyo	GCR doesn't do it right, nor can it allow imports of stuff that increases the file size
2014-09-17 22:13:01	@Espyo	hurry up with your thing, GP
2014-09-17 22:13:13	@Espyo	hm, guess I'll convert them
2014-09-17 22:13:15	@J	wip garbage crashes GCR
2014-09-17 22:13:24	@Espyo	mhm...
2014-09-17 22:13:41	@J	oh, probably because I'm using a read-only filesystem
2014-09-17 22:14:10	@J	what was all the 'how' at?
2014-09-17 22:14:38	@Espyo	I thought you were saying I had mixed line breaks inside the readme file
2014-09-17 22:14:40	@J	*wipe
2014-09-17 22:14:44	@Espyo	I was wondering how in the world that could be possible
2014-09-17 22:14:45	@J	oh, no
2014-09-17 22:14:53	@J	I don't think that's even really a thing that happens, yeah
2014-09-17 22:15:24	@Espyo	you can make it happen, but no decent program'd allow you to do it
2014-09-17 22:15:28	@Espyo	Notepad++ doesn't
2014-09-17 22:15:44	@J	okay, running GCR wipe garbage with the file writable made the VM reboot
2014-09-17 22:15:56	@Espyo	...wow
2014-09-17 22:15:56	@J	this is going to be fun
2014-09-17 22:16:09	@J	either that or a very sudden reboot for updates
2014-09-17 22:16:15	@Espyo	I never tried the wipe garbage thing, though
2014-09-17 22:16:41	@J	I was just trying to test _something_
2014-09-17 22:16:44	@J	that was the first thing
2014-09-17 22:16:59	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-09-17 22:17:09	@Espyo	pros will probably use your tool anyway
2014-09-17 22:17:14	@Espyo	this is more for casual users
2014-09-17 22:17:18	@Espyo	who just want to fiddle
2014-09-17 22:17:50	@J	yeah, I know the UI is all wrong, but there is a Python library that should work properly anywhere to do all the actual changes
2014-09-17 22:18:09	@J	okay, that wasn't very clear
2014-09-17 22:18:47	@J	I mean, all the code that does the changes to the disk is in one library, and is fully documented
2014-09-17 22:20:17	@J	well, Windows may be installing updates for some time
2014-09-17 22:20:22	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-17 22:20:44	@J	on the legal side, I guess you don't have permission to distribute all of these
2014-09-17 22:20:58	@Espyo	more like "none" of these
2014-09-17 22:21:04	@Espyo	but they're just there for safekeeping
2014-09-17 22:21:15	@Espyo	I know it's gray, but hey, the tools themselves aren't really very legal, are they
2014-09-17 22:21:20	@J	well, I noticed at least one is GPL, and links to the source, so that's fine
2014-09-17 22:21:22	@Espyo	created via reverse engineering and all
2014-09-17 22:21:31	@Espyo	most of them (all?) have the source code included
2014-09-17 22:21:39	@Espyo	so I doubt people'd be displeased with what I'm doing
2014-09-17 22:21:45	@J	except that it distributes some binaries for other GPL programs and doesn't even mention their licenses or where to get the source
2014-09-17 22:21:53	@J	that doesn't make it any more legal
2014-09-17 22:22:01	@Espyo	I know
2014-09-17 22:22:23	@Espyo	hey, I mention where to get the downloads
2014-09-17 22:22:27	@Espyo	the source included is in the downloads
2014-09-17 22:22:41	@Espyo	not quite sure this is one of those things that needs overthinking...
2014-09-17 22:23:04	@Espyo	hm, could always go with an alternate plan
2014-09-17 22:23:04	@J	uh...Windows forgot about my shared folder
2014-09-17 22:23:11	@Espyo	how /shocking/
2014-09-17 22:23:15	@J	between host and guest, I mean
2014-09-17 22:23:17	@Espyo	just use the readme and distribute that around
2014-09-17 22:23:29	@Espyo	and if I ever realize one of the programs is gone, I'll use my Dropbox as a mirror
2014-09-17 22:23:46	@J	could do
2014-09-17 22:24:16	@Espyo	yeah, probably less bad things will happen
2014-09-17 22:24:19	@J	I mean, I know it doesn't seem that important, but as a software developer myself, I would hope that people respect the license I distribute under
2014-09-17 22:24:42	@Espyo	of course
2014-09-17 22:25:03	@Espyo	it's just that you and I both know really well how these tools tend to disappear out of the blue
2014-09-17 22:25:08	@Espyo	and having a mirror would always be handy
2014-09-17 22:25:26	@Espyo	but I don't feel much like having to constantly check which tools are alive
2014-09-17 22:25:48	@Espyo	chances are that, if I do the no-redist version of this thing, I'll post the instruction/list file on Pikipedia
2014-09-17 22:25:57	@Espyo	and people can always post on Pikipedia to warn me about outdated tools
2014-09-17 22:26:04	@Espyo	unless we decide we don't want anon edits any more
2014-09-17 22:26:49	@J	okay, the VM died again
2014-09-17 22:27:06	@J	wait, so how do you extract the whole filesystem with GCR?
2014-09-17 22:27:21	@J	and also how do you change which file you're importing/exporting to?
2014-09-17 22:28:26	@J	yeah, fair enough, I'm sure you'll always have a local copy
2014-09-17 22:28:53	@J	I'll always vote for keeping anonymous edits enabled
2014-09-17 22:29:42	@Espyo	same here
2014-09-17 22:29:56	@Espyo	uh... are you sure we're even talking about the same GCR?
2014-09-17 22:30:01	@J	are many of these tools not available for direct download?
2014-09-17 22:30:04	@Espyo	extracting all makes sense, though I dunno how
2014-09-17 22:30:13	@Espyo	but you're making up the rest
2014-09-17 22:30:15	@Espyo	uh, 0, really
2014-09-17 22:30:15	@J	as in, do you have to enter a captcha or watch adverts or something
2014-09-17 22:30:27	@Espyo	they're all instantly accessible, afaik
2014-09-17 22:30:32	@Espyo	half of them are on amnoid.de
2014-09-17 22:30:34	@Espyo	instant access
2014-09-17 22:30:36	@J	oh, I didn't really know if GCR is meant to do that
2014-09-17 22:30:49	@J	what's the Root menu for, then?
2014-09-17 22:30:51	@Espyo	Wiimm's tools are in his site, ready to be downloaded
2014-09-17 22:31:20	@J	when I say direct download, I'm wondering more whether a script could download them
2014-09-17 22:31:21	@Espyo	I swear I don't know
2014-09-17 22:31:28	@Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2014-09-17 22:31:31	@Espyo	I think so, yes
2014-09-17 22:31:36	@Espyo	don't think any of them is behind this and that
2014-09-17 22:31:44	@Espyo	anyway, the Root menu is almost like a mousetrap
2014-09-17 22:31:49	@Espyo	bad analogy
2014-09-17 22:31:56	@Espyo	I only really need to use the Image menu, that's all
2014-09-17 22:33:21	@J	it's a pain to extract files one by one
2014-09-17 22:33:36	@Espyo	why do you even need to, though
2014-09-17 22:33:44	@Espyo	but anyway, if you want to extract all, just use Dolphin
2014-09-17 22:34:07	@J	oh, I just worked out how to
2014-09-17 22:34:23	@J	it's only available through the context menu of the tree on the right
2014-09-17 22:34:33	@Espyo	oh
2014-09-17 22:50:00	@J	this could do with a bulleted list of what tool to use for what
2014-09-17 22:50:23	@J	eg. 'extract szs: ...', 'create rarc: ...'
2014-09-17 22:51:18	@Espyo	I have that at the start
2014-09-17 22:51:24	@Espyo	but it's more like tool — function
2014-09-17 22:51:29	@Espyo	*functions
2014-09-17 22:51:52	@J	I ran some of the Wiimms tools, didn't need Cygwin or to install it
2014-09-17 22:52:10	@J	yeah, the other way around would be useful
2014-09-17 22:52:24	@J	because the Wiimms stuff does all the rarc and szs stuff too, and much better
2014-09-17 22:53:02	@J	it can replace the lunaboy and szstools things, really
2014-09-17 22:56:02	@J	hmm, your readme says Windows < 8 can't associate files with bat files?
2014-09-17 22:56:08	@J	I'm not really surprised, TBH
2014-09-17 22:56:29	@J	anyway, stuff seems to mostly work
2014-09-17 22:56:54	@J	I would add manual word-wrap to your readme, and add the reverse list thing I mentioned
2014-09-17 22:57:28	@J	so yeah, Wiimms can replace other stuff, but the others are easier to use
2014-09-17 22:57:40	@J	maybe you can provide some bat files
2014-09-17 22:58:03	@Espyo	yeah, I don't really get why it says you need Cygwin
2014-09-17 22:58:17	@Espyo	I've had them for a while, and I just c+p from what I had, but I don't remember really needing Cygwin
2014-09-17 22:58:44	@Espyo	Wiimm's tools aren't compatible with Pikmin 2 though...
2014-09-17 22:58:46	@Espyo	are they?
2014-09-17 22:58:51	@Espyo	they can't be, I'm pretty sure I tried before
2014-09-17 22:59:19	@Espyo	I provide instructions on creating a batch file
2014-09-17 22:59:23	@Espyo	rather, ONE batch file
2014-09-17 23:03:01	@J	did you see: http://wit.wiimm.de/
2014-09-17 23:03:24	@J	I used the szs extractor on a Pikmin 2 file
2014-09-17 23:03:35	@J	yeah, I saw that, that's why I suggested you just do it
2014-09-17 23:03:39	@J	save others the hassle
2014-09-17 23:03:59	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-17 23:04:00	@J	...oh
2014-09-17 23:04:09	@Espyo	I lazied out a bit on this whole project, can't really tell why
2014-09-17 23:04:12	@J	when the download says Cygwin, it means that's how it's implemented
2014-09-17 23:04:17	@Espyo	oh, neat
2014-09-17 23:04:23	@J	it bundles executables generated using Cygwin as the compiler
2014-09-17 23:04:34	@Espyo	hm, all right, it can extract szs, but can it extract the underlying .rarc?
2014-09-17 23:04:39	@Espyo	what about re-packing? 'cause that's important
2014-09-17 23:06:32	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Emergence Cave by Espyo (+2 m /* Emergence Cave run */ For how long as this been broken?) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Emergence_Cave&curid=550&diff=138596&oldid=137853
2014-09-17 23:09:55	Testyo	588 KK
2014-09-17 23:10:02	@Espyo	k
2014-09-17 23:13:08	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqwsioctF8s so apparently this is the latest WR
2014-09-17 23:13:14	@Espyo	set a few days ago
2014-09-17 23:13:58	@J	yeah, it has szs and rarc support, both extract and create
2014-09-17 23:14:32	@J	these tools do a ridiculous amount of stuff
2014-09-17 23:14:38	@J	have you looked at the documentation?
2014-09-17 23:15:05	@J	doesn't seem to support editing arbitrary files in-place, but it can modify some metadata in the disk
2014-09-17 23:15:20	@J	and it has FUSE support, doesn't say if this supports writes
2014-09-17 23:15:32	@Espyo	hm, but will Pikmin 2 LIKE it?
2014-09-17 23:15:34	@J	if it does, it's easily the best way to edit images, if you're not using Windows
2014-09-17 23:15:37	@Espyo	that's the main thing
2014-09-17 23:15:41	@J	maybe
2014-09-17 23:15:45	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure Wiimm's tools are aimed at Wii games
2014-09-17 23:15:49	@J	hmm
2014-09-17 23:15:52	@Espyo	which use different formats
2014-09-17 23:15:58	@J	yeah, maybe
2014-09-17 23:16:01	@Espyo	though the fact that it decodes Pikmin 2's files is a good hint
2014-09-17 23:16:08	@J	the szs/rarc stuff is independent
2014-09-17 23:16:12	@J	but the ISO stuff may not work
2014-09-17 23:16:13	@Espyo	but I find it hard to believe that we've had perfect tools for the job all this time
2014-09-17 23:16:21	@Espyo	and never noticed
2014-09-17 23:17:29	@J	hmm, you don't normally see SS runs of auto-saving games
2014-09-17 23:17:46	@J	well, they might not be perfect, but there's a lot of useful stuff there
2014-09-17 23:17:57	@J	you'd probably gain from looking into it all
2014-09-17 23:18:02	@J	and trying stuff out
2014-09-17 23:18:16	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-17 23:18:18	@Espyo	will do tomorrow
2014-09-17 23:18:20	@Espyo	hopefully
2014-09-17 23:18:24	@Espyo	same for the run
2014-09-17 23:18:34	@Espyo	feeling really tired today for some reason, might go to bed in just  afew
2014-09-17 23:18:35	@Espyo	*a few
2014-09-17 23:19:46	@J	http://code.google.com/p/qtwitgui/
2014-09-17 23:20:30	@Espyo	woah
2014-09-17 23:20:37	@Espyo	might be worth looking into
2014-09-17 23:21:46	@J	I'll try now, see if I can get something working quickly
2014-09-17 23:21:47	@J	AUR has it
2014-09-17 23:21:52	@J	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=qtwitgui
2014-09-17 23:22:03	@Espyo	nice
2014-09-17 23:23:13	@J	finished compiling
2014-09-17 23:25:02	@Espyo	yeah, I think I'm calling it a night
2014-09-17 23:25:09	@J	okay, goodnight

2014-09-18 15:34:04	@PikFan	yesterday, I wasn't working on the fruit pages because I was taking screenshots of fruit
2014-09-18 15:34:20	@PikFan	I am to take a picture of all fruit locations

2014-09-18 15:38:36	@Espyo	ugh, probably too late

2014-09-18 15:38:43	@Espyo	*page
2014-09-18 15:38:52	@Espyo	all right, good idea
2014-09-18 15:41:57	@Espyo	I can take the screenies too, though
2014-09-18 15:42:02	@Espyo	'cause I'll be playing a second playthrough anyway
2014-09-18 15:42:15	@Espyo	so don't go through the trouble of restarting just for that, because I will restart anyway

2014-09-18 22:54:18	@J	...
2014-09-18 22:54:48	@J	so yeah, that Gui thing I linked and tried yesterday was kind of terrible
2014-09-18 22:54:54	@J	crashy and doesn't really do much
2014-09-18 22:55:34	@Espyo	bleh
2014-09-18 22:55:40	@Espyo	must be because VM, though
2014-09-18 22:55:45	@J	there were lots of sounds from Pikmin hitting water, so maybe it hit the concurrent sound limit
2014-09-18 22:55:47	@J	no, Linux version
2014-09-18 22:56:21	@Espyo	but the glitch keeps going and going

2014-09-18 22:57:28	@J	hmm
2014-09-18 22:57:39	@J	it happens

2014-09-19 14:59:50	@PikFan	okay
2014-09-19 15:00:53	@PikFan	did you disable Testyo's wiki fetching?

2014-09-19 15:02:38	@Espyo	try to find the max kill cap
2014-09-19 15:02:39	@PikFan	I haven't played P3 in a while anyway

2014-09-19 15:02:51	@PikFan	for each enemy?

2014-09-19 15:03:20	@Espyo	I'll do it when I do my 2nd playthrough, but if you want, you can do it to save me work
2014-09-19 15:03:26	@Espyo	yeah, you can point it down somewhere and then I'll add
2014-09-19 15:03:36	@PikFan	I see
2014-09-19 15:03:44	@PikFan	off the top of my head...
2014-09-19 15:03:52	@PikFan	uh
2014-09-19 15:04:09	@PikFan	well, all Dwarf Bulborbs are 1
2014-09-19 15:04:16	@Espyo	so same as the classics
2014-09-19 15:05:51	@Espyo	wait...
2014-09-19 15:05:57	@Espyo	is it "Blonde Imposter" or "Blonde Impostor"?
2014-09-19 15:06:07	@Espyo	not even gonna ask about "blonde" or "blond"
2014-09-19 15:06:15	@PikFan	yeah, that was something I was meaning to ask about
2014-09-19 15:06:49	@PikFan	in my version of the game, it's Blonde Impostor
2014-09-19 15:06:56	@Espyo	dictionaries say impostOr as the word
2014-09-19 15:07:00	@Espyo	imposter practically doesn't exist
2014-09-19 15:07:07	@Espyo	I can't believe the wikians actually named it impostEr
2014-09-19 15:07:09	@PikFan	hmm
2014-09-19 15:07:09	@Espyo	good grief...
2014-09-19 15:07:19	@Espyo	c'mon, I know you guys don't care much for quality control
2014-09-19 15:07:20	@PikFan	maybe it was a version difference
2014-09-19 15:07:22	@Espyo	but COME ON
2014-09-19 15:07:33	@Espyo	I'll have to check when I get home
2014-09-19 15:07:43	@Espyo	also, Bug-Eyed Crawmad, Bug-eyed Crawmad or Bugeyed Crawmad
2014-09-19 15:08:07	@PikFan	"The Blonde Imposter/Impostor (ニカケヒトシ) is a..."
2014-09-19 15:08:19	@PikFan	so they did recognize both words
2014-09-19 15:08:42	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-09-19 15:08:58	@Espyo	but if we're following the US spelling, the article should be ImpostOr
2014-09-19 15:09:06	@Espyo	can you triple-check when you get home?
2014-09-19 15:09:23	@Espyo	we have to be 100% sure what the US version calls it and what the EU version calls it
2014-09-19 15:09:57	@Espyo	>Tell me, Ms. Fauna, if you are indeed animal and not vegetable, Where are your legs?!
2014-09-19 15:10:01	@Espyo	>vegetable, Where
2014-09-19 15:10:07	@PikFan	gleh
2014-09-19 15:10:08	@Espyo	capital after comma? could you check that too?
2014-09-19 15:10:11	@Espyo	it's on the US version
2014-09-19 15:10:15	@Espyo	could've been a typo in-game
2014-09-19 15:10:17	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-19 15:10:52	@PikFan	can you go through and check the PAL versions?
2014-09-19 15:11:04	@PikFan	(yes, I used PAL, but this is a chatroom)
2014-09-19 15:11:08	@Espyo	heh
2014-09-19 15:11:12	@Espyo	of course
2014-09-19 15:11:23	@Espyo	don't have them all yet, but I'll double check as soon as I do
2014-09-19 15:11:31	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-19 15:11:44	@Espyo	hmm, random thing
2014-09-19 15:11:45	@PikFan	so far, I've taken a screenshot of 26 fruits
2014-09-19 15:11:49	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-09-19 15:11:55	@Espyo	we'll add to [[Charlie]] when we find out
2014-09-19 15:12:02	@Espyo	but you know how you don't have to hurry to get Charlie?
2014-09-19 15:12:08	@Espyo	your only real limit is the fruit you can live with
2014-09-19 15:12:16	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-19 15:12:20	@Espyo	it'd be fun to know how many days you can delay Charlie's rescue for
2014-09-19 15:12:31	@Espyo	and in the end, learn that he can survive without eating for like 16 days or something crazy
2014-09-19 15:12:49	@Espyo	unless he gets food inside the Phosbat... *shudder*
2014-09-19 15:12:50	@PikFan	hmmm
2014-09-19 15:13:02	@Espyo	of course, we wouldn't add it as fact, but as possibility
2014-09-19 15:13:18	@PikFan	probably add up all juice values of each then-accessible fruit
2014-09-19 15:13:33	@PikFan	then figure out how many days are left
2014-09-19 15:13:47	@Espyo	"should the player delay their rescue for as long as possible, they can reach Charlie X days after his kidnapping, and find him well and healthy. This raises the question on how the captain could've survived for so long with neither food or water"
2014-09-19 15:13:51	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2014-09-19 15:13:56	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard
2014-09-19 15:14:04	@PikFan	...wait
2014-09-19 15:14:11	@PikFan	I don't even have to do that
2014-09-19 15:14:19	@Espyo	I mean, I'm implying we find him well and wealthy
2014-09-19 15:14:21	@PikFan	I can just check how much juice I have left
2014-09-19 15:14:36	@Espyo	it'd be amazing if you were to reach Charlie after 3 weeks and realize he's dead
2014-09-19 15:14:38	@PikFan	I haven't gathered any fruits in the TW yet
2014-09-19 15:15:09	@PikFan	brb
2014-09-19 15:15:27	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-19 15:15:39	@Espyo	wait, so are you playing right now?
2014-09-19 15:35:26	@Espyo	phew, done 'em all
2014-09-19 15:35:38	@PikFan	back
2014-09-19 15:35:46	@Espyo	also apparently the Scaly Custard being the crocodile scrotum thing is actually quite normal
2014-09-19 15:35:49	@PikFan	was getting ready for school
2014-09-19 15:35:57	@PikFan	heh, why?
2014-09-19 15:36:00	@Espyo	wikipedia says they're also known as "alligator pear"
2014-09-19 15:36:16	@PikFan	hmm
2014-09-19 15:36:20	@Espyo	and that the name of the fruit in Nahuatl can also be used as "testicle"
2014-09-19 15:36:31	@PikFan	whaaat
2014-09-19 15:36:33	@Espyo	yep
2014-09-19 15:36:36	@PikFan	wow
2014-09-19 15:36:53	@Espyo	so the Japanese didn't really make anything up, they just used the actual historical names meshed together
2014-09-19 15:37:03	@PikFan	anyway, school
2014-09-19 15:37:10	@PikFan	back around 4 PM PDT
2014-09-19 15:37:12	@PikFan	bye

2014-09-19 23:12:50	@J	they're trying so hard
2014-09-19 23:13:15	@Espyo	you're gonna have to specify the video
2014-09-19 23:13:15	@Espyo	...never mmind
2014-09-19 23:13:15	@Espyo	*mind
2014-09-19 23:13:16	@Espyo	I thought I linked to the channel
2014-09-19 23:13:23	@Espyo	like, that part of the video's pretty lulzy
2014-09-19 23:13:27	@Espyo	but the second half... I don't even know
2014-09-19 23:16:36	@J	I don't get it
2014-09-19 23:16:47	@J	that's just the stuff after the point of the video
2014-09-19 23:16:48	@Espyo	how did that Yellow even die?
2014-09-19 23:23:53	@Espyo	all right, here's a policy we should discuss
2014-09-19 23:23:56	@Espyo	section order
2014-09-19 23:24:53	@Espyo	glitches, technical info, gallery, trivia, names in other languages, references, see also, external links, navboxes
2014-09-19 23:24:55	@Espyo	these sections
2014-09-19 23:24:57	@Espyo	here's my suggestion:
2014-09-19 23:25:02	@Espyo	wait
2014-09-19 23:25:04	@Espyo	that was the suggestion
2014-09-19 23:25:23	@Espyo	those are the sections we should probably try to keep an order of, and that's the order I recommend
2014-09-19 23:25:40	@Espyo	the further down the article, the more unrelated and useless the info is
2014-09-19 23:25:46	@Espyo	except for the navboxes, but they're always last
2014-09-19 23:25:53	@Espyo	thoughts?
2014-09-19 23:27:28	@J	seems okay
2014-09-19 23:28:02	@J	hmm, maybe references lower down, since you never actually scroll there, you just follow a link to get there
2014-09-19 23:28:03	@Espyo	references should be after trivia because you could always want to source something on trivia
2014-09-19 23:28:12	@Espyo	good point
2014-09-19 23:28:27	@Espyo	but the question is below or above external links...
2014-09-19 23:28:37	@J	below
2014-09-19 23:28:46	@Espyo	the references are pretty much meant to be footnotes, so I guess it makes sense
2014-09-19 23:28:51	@Espyo	and like you said, they're less used
2014-09-19 23:28:57	@Espyo	all right, I can see it
2014-09-19 23:29:05	@J	I don't think the order matters too much, really, as long as it's consistent
2014-09-19 23:29:20	@Espyo	yeah, that's mostly why I felt the need to bring it up
2014-09-19 23:29:49	@J	your first 3 can easily be subsections of other sections
2014-09-19 23:30:47	@Espyo	in some circumstances, but not all
2014-09-19 23:31:20	@Espyo	but when there's just one, this order would work, right?
2014-09-19 23:33:09	@J	yeah
2014-09-19 23:33:21	@Espyo	hey, wanna do it?
2014-09-19 23:33:24	@J	no
2014-09-19 23:33:24	@Espyo	I mean, add it
2014-09-19 23:33:34	@J	too lazy
2014-09-19 23:33:37	@Espyo	so people don't think you're just some bum who is an admin for no reason and never really contributes
2014-09-19 23:33:41	@J	and a bit tired
2014-09-19 23:33:48	@Espyo	so am I, but I could do it
2014-09-19 23:33:49	@J	hey, I contribute via moral support
2014-09-19 23:33:54	@J	also you can just look at my editcount
2014-09-19 23:33:57	@Espyo	people can't see that thought
2014-09-19 23:34:05	@Espyo	yeah, but they might think you died
2014-09-19 23:34:22	@Espyo	how hard can it be?

2014-09-19 23:34:45	@J	make me a thing so I can edit through Testyo

2014-09-19 23:34:51	@J	yes, very bit

2014-09-19 23:35:21	@Espyo	I'd probably take 3 weeks to implement

2014-09-19 23:35:53	@J	fine, fine, I'll do it
2014-09-19 23:36:12	@Espyo	you just have to copy-paste my list (with references at the bottom)

2014-09-19 23:57:59	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-19 23:58:13	@PikFan	then enemies... *shiver*
2014-09-19 23:58:27	@Espyo	won't take longer than fruits
2014-09-19 23:58:31	@Espyo	if you're taking pics of all fruis
2014-09-19 23:58:32	@Espyo	*fruits
2014-09-19 23:58:39	@PikFan	no, not that
2014-09-19 23:58:48	@PikFan	like, fixing them up
2014-09-19 23:59:05	@Espyo	uh
2014-09-19 23:59:15	@Espyo	then why the screenshots?
2014-09-19 23:59:31	@PikFan	?
2014-09-19 23:59:37	@PikFan	I don't follow
2014-09-19 23:59:40	@Espyo	you're taking screenshots of the fruits and uploading them
2014-09-19 23:59:58	@Espyo	<Espyo> if you're taking pics of all fruis<PikFan> no, not that
2014-09-20 00:00:05	@Espyo	(pretend that's two lines)
2014-09-20 00:00:40	@PikFan	what I meant was that I'm dreading fixing the enemy articles
2014-09-20 00:01:07	@PikFan	the fruit screenshots are to show where the fruits are, for every single one of them
2014-09-20 00:01:16	@Espyo	oh
2014-09-20 00:01:30	@Espyo	I'll help too eventually
2014-09-20 00:01:35	@Espyo	once I'm comfortable enough with the game
2014-09-20 00:01:43	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-20 00:01:50	@Espyo	meanwhile, dunno if I said, but I bought a tablet
2014-09-20 00:01:55	@PikFan	mhm, yes
2014-09-20 00:02:01	@Espyo	and I'm using it on my rides on the subway, which are one hour to go and one hour to return
2014-09-20 00:02:04	@PikFan	for working on the engine on the subway
2014-09-20 00:02:08	@Espyo	so during those two hours, I whip it —
2014-09-20 00:02:09	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-20 00:02:17	@Espyo	though currently I'm using it to compare and merge cave articles
2014-09-20 00:02:25	@Espyo	they're long reads, so it fits a tablet well
2014-09-20 00:02:25	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-09-20 00:02:32	@Espyo	it's better to read than to write there, eesh
2014-09-20 00:02:40	@PikFan	heh
2014-09-20 00:02:44	@Espyo	either I take a bit to get the hang of it, or tablets were never really meant for code editing
2014-09-20 00:03:02	@PikFan	by the way, can you find out how many pages don't have game icons?
2014-09-20 00:03:12	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-20 00:03:13	@PikFan	I remember J had a list a while back, but that's outdated
2014-09-20 00:03:25	@Espyo	[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Game icons]]
2014-09-20 00:03:25	Testyo	"Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Game_icons" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Game_icons
2014-09-20 00:03:31	@Espyo	subtract the total number of mainspace pages with that
2014-09-20 00:03:33	@Espyo	and there you go
2014-09-20 00:03:43	@PikFan	err
2014-09-20 00:03:52	@PikFan	I should have said, what pages
2014-09-20 00:03:53	@Espyo	or just edit the template so that it automatically cats pages with no icon
2014-09-20 00:03:56	@Espyo	oh
2014-09-20 00:03:57	@PikFan	but yeah
2014-09-20 00:03:59	@Espyo	then my second thing
2014-09-20 00:05:03	@PikFan	hey J
2014-09-20 00:05:19	@Espyo	not sure if here's there
2014-09-20 00:05:22	@PikFan	(is he asleep)
2014-09-20 00:05:24	@Espyo	I know I won't be, gotta go to bed
2014-09-20 00:05:39	@PikFan	it's the weekend, though
2014-09-20 00:05:47	@PikFan	what time is it there?
2014-09-20 00:05:54	@Espyo	midnight
2014-09-20 00:05:59	@PikFan	I see
2014-09-20 00:06:00	@Espyo	yeah, but we have tiring days at work
2014-09-20 00:06:07	@Espyo	at least I have
2014-09-20 00:06:11	@Espyo	not like I work with him
2014-09-20 00:06:24	@PikFan	your job isn't hard labor, is it?
2014-09-20 00:06:42	@PikFan	thought it was an internship
2014-09-20 00:07:10	@Espyo	it's a professional internship
2014-09-20 00:07:17	@PikFan	I see
2014-09-20 00:07:22	@Espyo	pretty much a pretty way of saying it's a job, but I'm getting a tutor and less pay
2014-09-20 00:07:22	@PikFan	well, night
2014-09-20 00:07:24	@Espyo	night
2014-09-20 00:07:39	<--	Espyo (Espyo@89.152.yos.pwz) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-09-20 00:07:42	<--	Testyo (Testyo@89.152.yos.pwz) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-09-20 00:14:17	@J	I had a sudden urge for some midnight juggling
2014-09-20 00:14:31	@PikFan	midnight... what?
2014-09-20 00:14:35	@PikFan	oh
2014-09-20 00:14:39	@PikFan	silly me
2014-09-20 00:15:06	@PikFan	I thought you meant some sort of wacky activity
2014-09-20 00:15:53	@J	I am never ever wacky
2014-09-20 00:16:04	@PikFan	uh huh...
2014-09-20 00:16:34	@PikFan	ooh, also
2014-09-20 00:17:07	@PikFan	if you read my conversation with Espyo, can you make a list of pages without game icons?
2014-09-20 00:22:23	@J	exclude /merge pages, right?
2014-09-20 00:22:29	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-20 00:23:00	@J	though some merge pages seem to include it
2014-09-20 00:23:05	@J	probably through an infobox on both wikis
2014-09-20 00:23:12	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-20 00:23:45	@J	uh...there seem to be a lot of them, if I did this right
2014-09-20 00:23:47	@PikFan	are you manually counting them, or are you using a script or something?
2014-09-20 00:24:58	@J	script
2014-09-20 00:25:02	@J	ah, some might be redirects
2014-09-20 00:25:12	@PikFan	hmm
2014-09-20 00:27:48	@J	there we go, that's better
2014-09-20 00:27:50	@J	181 pages
2014-09-20 00:28:21	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/no-game_icons-pages.txt
2014-09-20 00:28:39	@PikFan	thanks
2014-09-20 00:28:44	@PikFan	sorry for keeping you
2014-09-20 00:29:07	@J	it's fine, I wasn't in a hurry to leave
2014-09-20 00:29:30	@PikFan	yeah, but you usually sleep around this time
2014-09-20 00:29:44	@J	meh, like you said, it's a weekend
2014-09-20 00:30:10	@PikFan	true
2014-09-20 00:31:20	@PikFan	...seeing the Super Smash Bros. articles and Nintendo Land, we'll have to make icons for those
2014-09-20 00:31:37	@PikFan	*Super Smash Bros. and Nintendo Land articles
2014-09-20 00:33:16	@J	hey look, I did a thing
2014-09-20 00:33:18	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/no-game_icons-pages.html
2014-09-20 00:33:27	@J	and it's all wrong
2014-09-20 00:33:29	@J	...
2014-09-20 00:33:42	@PikFan	?
2014-09-20 00:34:11	@PikFan	oh, I see
2014-09-20 00:35:04	@J	okay, fixed
2014-09-20 00:35:50	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Truffle
2014-09-20 00:35:53	@J	what's with this page?
2014-09-20 00:36:17	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-09-20 00:36:30	@J	I see broken icons
2014-09-20 00:37:12	@J	same with lots of pages
2014-09-20 00:41:14	@J	well, I'm going now
2014-09-20 00:41:16	@J	goodnight
2014-09-20 00:41:32	@PikFan	night

2014-09-20 14:25:32	@J	it's perfectly normal
2014-09-20 14:37:24	@Espyo	how can you even live with 7 hours of sleep every night
2014-09-20 14:37:34	@Espyo	I feel fine if I do, until like wednesday
2014-09-20 14:37:38	@Espyo	and then my life starts to crumble
2014-09-20 14:38:09	@J	what makes you think I got up early?
2014-09-20 14:38:29	@Espyo	no, not today
2014-09-20 14:38:32	@Espyo	but the rest of the days
2014-09-20 14:38:39	@Espyo	I'd assume you'd be nearly dying by the end of Friday
2014-09-20 14:39:18	@J	I thought a while back you were commenting on how early I seem to go to bed
2014-09-20 14:39:37	@Espyo	eh, probably
2014-09-20 14:39:42	@J	then you get a job, and suddenly
2014-09-20 14:39:43	@Espyo	don't even know any more
2014-09-20 14:39:49	@Espyo	just know that today I wanted to sleep until midday
2014-09-20 14:39:53	@Espyo	and my body just didn't let me
2014-09-20 14:39:54	@J	heh
2014-09-20 14:40:09	@Espyo	yeah, every time the body decides on how and when it should sleep, it goes wrong
2014-09-20 14:40:10	@J	I usually sleep around midnight and wake around 8
2014-09-20 14:40:16	@Espyo	humans should've evolved to control sleep already, dammit
2014-09-20 14:40:27	@J	weekends are kind of random
2014-09-20 14:40:28	@Espyo	I sleep at midnight and wake up at 7:20
2014-09-20 14:40:33	@Espyo	not a huge difference
2014-09-20 14:40:52	@J	maybe you need to eat more
2014-09-20 14:41:02	@Espyo	probably
2014-09-20 14:41:12	@Espyo	...or eating will just make me more drowsy
2014-09-20 14:43:25	@J	the trick is to eat food instead of sleeping pills
2014-09-20 14:44:00	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-09-20 14:45:30	@Espyo	http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=387098#387098
2014-09-20 14:45:33	@Espyo	I'm not following
2014-09-20 14:45:40	@Espyo	first AngerFist said he was a pro at the game
2014-09-20 14:45:48	@Espyo	now he's pointing out he didn't know you can skip visors?
2014-09-20 14:46:04	@Espyo	I'm not that into the Metroid Prime deep things, but even I know that
2014-09-20 14:48:11	@Espyo	or maybe I skimmed over him saying he's a pro
2014-09-20 14:48:24	@Espyo	but still, jumping into a Metroid Prime TAS and not even knowing that...
2014-09-20 14:55:50	Miles	I'm staying far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far away from that topic
2014-09-20 14:56:55	Miles	Just
2014-09-20 14:57:03	Miles	Wondering if it's faster to skip Space Jump
2014-09-20 14:57:09	Miles	How can you seriously
2014-09-20 14:57:09	@Espyo	loads of ignorance and conflicting ideas, yeah
2014-09-20 14:57:11	Miles	I don't
2014-09-20 14:57:13	Miles	Why
2014-09-20 14:57:26	@Espyo	it's best for your sanity
2014-09-20 14:57:39	@Espyo	I'll let you know when somebody with actual potential shows up
2014-09-20 15:17:48	@Espyo	...damn, I keep forgetting your gcedit crashes when I move the window
2014-09-20 15:23:11	@Espyo	uh, Wiimms SZS Tools are generating empty files
2014-09-20 15:23:18	@Espyo	I can extract from szs just fine, but not back into it
2014-09-20 15:24:37	@Espyo	or maybe I'm using the wrong commad
2014-09-20 15:24:39	@Espyo	*command
2014-09-20 15:27:31	@Espyo	all right, P2 crashes
2014-09-20 15:27:53	@Espyo	now I want to know if this is because Wiimms SZS Tools don't work for this, or if it's something I did wrong
2014-09-20 15:28:00	@Espyo	can you give it a try J?
2014-09-20 15:28:02	@Espyo	I'm not using the GUI
2014-09-20 15:28:11	@Espyo	extract mesRes_eng.szs, in /messages
2014-09-20 15:28:26	@Espyo	search the file for like "novice training" and replace some characters, keeping the same file size
2014-09-20 15:28:32	@Espyo	and try repacking and putting it back in P2
2014-09-20 15:33:00	@J	is there something in the wiimms tools for rarc?
2014-09-20 15:33:30	@Espyo	it can extract rarc
2014-09-20 15:33:46	@Espyo	when I told it to extract mesRes_eng.szs, it gave me the final directory right away
2014-09-20 15:34:02	@Espyo	and unless I'm not remembering right, mesRes_eng.szs is a .rarc file compressed into .szs
2014-09-20 15:34:11	@Espyo	so .szs -> .rarc -> directory
2014-09-20 15:34:19	@Espyo	and director -> .rarc -> .szs
2014-09-20 15:34:41	@J	yeah, I got it
2014-09-20 15:34:54	@J	is there really a directory in the rarc, or did it create one?
2014-09-20 15:35:15	@Espyo	directory as in the final data
2014-09-20 15:35:16	@J	yeah, looks like it creates one
2014-09-20 15:35:19	@J	that might be your issue
2014-09-20 15:35:25	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-20 15:35:42	@Espyo	no, but I don't tell it to pack the folder, I don't think
2014-09-20 15:35:52	@Espyo	I issue the command on the folder, but I think what it really does is pack the data inside
2014-09-20 15:36:00	@Espyo	unless I do CREATE ./*
2014-09-20 15:36:09	@Espyo	which will likely make windows barf
2014-09-20 15:36:15	@J	wait, you edited the rarc directly?
2014-09-20 15:36:20	@Espyo	no
2014-09-20 15:36:33	@J	which file do I look in?
2014-09-20 15:36:33	@Espyo	when I told WSZST to extract mesRes_eng.szs
2014-09-20 15:36:40	@Espyo	it automatically created a folder with the string things
2014-09-20 15:36:44	@J	I got a bmg and a bmc
2014-09-20 15:36:59	@Espyo	with other tools, the extraction of the .szs would create a .rarc, and then I'd have to unpack the .rarc to get the bmg and bmc
2014-09-20 15:37:03	@Espyo	the bmg is the one with the strings
2014-09-20 15:37:08	@Espyo	bmc might be some index table or something
2014-09-20 15:37:47	@J	I can't find 'novice' in it
2014-09-20 15:37:52	@J	did it matter what?
2014-09-20 15:38:00	@J	oh, caps
2014-09-20 15:38:04	@Espyo	yep
2014-09-20 15:38:22	@Espyo	you can edit anything, really, but the training mode stage names are the easiest to figure out if they're working
2014-09-20 15:38:30	@Espyo	for some reason, if I change the title screen option names, it won't work
2014-09-20 15:38:41	@Espyo	hm, I might be able to edit the warning about 50 or 60hz, though
2014-09-20 15:38:54	@J	it also made a wszst-setup.txt file
2014-09-20 15:39:03	@Espyo	did to me, too
2014-09-20 15:39:12	@Espyo	according to the file, that's data it generated to know how to re-pack
2014-09-20 15:39:17	@Espyo	I tried with and without that file
2014-09-20 15:40:37	@J	okay, I got the szs back
2014-09-20 15:41:06	@Espyo	all right, now try putting it in-game
2014-09-20 15:41:17	@Espyo	if all goes wrong, it should freeze after the Pikmin goes "Pikmin!"
2014-09-20 15:41:23	@J	it's larger
2014-09-20 15:41:44	@Espyo	yeah, every tool I tried generated larger .szs files than the original
2014-09-20 15:41:53	@Espyo	there are several levels of compression for .szs files
2014-09-20 15:42:04	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 might take up to eleven — maybe literally
2014-09-20 15:42:15	@Espyo	both the Python program and Wiimms' use a scale from 0 to 9
2014-09-20 15:42:24	@Espyo	so the Pikmin 2 devs using 11 seems possible
2014-09-20 15:42:28	@Espyo	obviously, impossible
2014-09-20 15:42:30	@Espyo	but...
2014-09-20 15:42:31	@Espyo	just never mind
2014-09-20 15:43:19	@Espyo	I'll be really pissed if after all this time, Wiimms SZS Tools did exactly what we wanted and more
2014-09-20 15:48:46	@J	I did it, but the ISO is in my VM and all the shared folders are read-only
2014-09-20 15:48:49	@J	just a minute...

2014-09-20 16:11:20	@Espyo	weird
2014-09-20 16:12:06	@J	okay, it's working
2014-09-20 16:12:09	@J	I just made a new one
2014-09-20 16:12:58	@Espyo	if I leave wszst-setup.txt, CREATE creates a .rarc
2014-09-20 16:13:05	@Espyo	it should've creates a .szs...
2014-09-20 16:13:07	@Espyo	renaming doesn't work
2014-09-20 16:14:07	@Espyo	trying COMPRESS on the .arc also crashes
2014-09-20 16:14:15	@Espyo	I mean, crashes Dolphin
2014-09-20 16:14:18	@Espyo	I mean, freezes Dolphin
2014-09-20 16:14:21	@Espyo	I mean, freezes the game
2014-09-20 16:15:03	Testyo	have to be fast to know why
2014-09-20 16:15:16	@Espyo	Testyo's right
2014-09-20 16:15:17	Testyo	they manage the more technical aspects of the end, aren't they?
2014-09-20 16:15:28	@Espyo	the window only exists for a couple of seconds
2014-09-20 16:15:33	@Espyo	or would, if I were using a batch file
2014-09-20 16:15:40	@J	okay, yeah, it crashes
2014-09-20 16:15:52	@J	right _before_ the 'Pikmin!'
2014-09-20 16:16:01	@Espyo	either we don't know what we're doing... or these tools don't work
2014-09-20 16:16:05	@Espyo	but do you get to see the Nintendo logo appear?
2014-09-20 16:16:12	@J	no
2014-09-20 16:16:18	@J	wait
2014-09-20 16:16:19	@Espyo	hmm, that's a bit different, then
2014-09-20 16:16:20	@J	maybe

2014-09-20 16:16:28	@J	no
2014-09-20 16:16:35	@J	I just get the health and safety warning
2014-09-20 16:16:41	@Espyo	oh, US version
2014-09-20 16:16:41	@J	press A, get the sound
2014-09-20 16:16:49	@Espyo	I'm on the EU version
2014-09-20 16:16:50	@J	then a buzzing noise
2014-09-20 16:17:16	@Espyo	ouch
2014-09-20 16:17:36	@J	you should be doing CREATE on the directory that got extracted
2014-09-20 16:17:41	@J	to get a rarc
2014-09-20 16:17:46	@Espyo	I am
2014-09-20 16:17:47	@J	then COMPRESS on that to get a szs
2014-09-20 16:17:50	@Espyo	yep
2014-09-20 16:17:54	@Espyo	still crashes
2014-09-20 16:17:56	@J	that's what I did, and I don't see any other way of doing itn
2014-09-20 16:17:57	@J	*itn
2014-09-20 16:17:58	@J	**it
2014-09-20 16:18:08	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-09-20 16:20:41	@Espyo	well, time to mess with flags
2014-09-20 16:20:53	@Espyo	actually, let me see if CREATE is fine
2014-09-20 16:21:01	@Espyo	by compressing to .szs with another tool

2014-09-20 16:23:22	@J	I replaced the original file back into the same disk and it works again
2014-09-20 16:23:53	@J	I should be able to check if COMPRESS alone is fine
2014-09-20 16:24:27	@Espyo	even if I use szstools to pack the .rarc into a .szs, it crashes
2014-09-20 16:25:56	@Espyo	I tried packing to .rarc with another tool, that I know works
2014-09-20 16:26:04	@Espyo	and am trying Wiimms' COMPRESS
2014-09-20 16:26:15	@Espyo	but... it wants to convert the .arc into .arc
2014-09-20 16:27:18	@J	wait, COMPRESS gives me .arc now, pretty sure it gave .szs before
2014-09-20 16:27:30	@J	else where did I get that .szs from...
2014-09-20 16:28:03	@Espyo	it did give .szs before
2014-09-20 16:28:17	@Espyo	but if we compress it with another tool... it wants to give a .rarc for some reason
2014-09-20 16:28:43	@Espyo	even with --szs enabled
2014-09-20 16:29:41	@J	hey, that works
2014-09-20 16:29:47	@Espyo	not for me...
2014-09-20 16:30:13	@J	okay, so the rarc creator is doing something wrong
2014-09-20 16:30:23	@Espyo	COMPRESS works, huh
2014-09-20 16:30:52	@Espyo	gah, it's completely ignoring my "--szs"
2014-09-20 16:32:18	@J	OH, create gives .szs directly
2014-09-20 16:32:23	@J	that's where I got it from
2014-09-20 16:32:30	@Espyo	that doesn't add up then
2014-09-20 16:32:36	@Espyo	my create gives a .rarc every time
2014-09-20 16:32:52	@J	I just ran: wszst create mesRes_eng.d/
2014-09-20 16:33:03	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-20 16:33:06	@Espyo	same, really

2014-09-20 16:33:09	@Espyo	bar the bar at the right
2014-09-20 16:33:15	@Espyo	STOP DOING THINGS I CAN'T DO
2014-09-20 16:33:25	@Espyo	you didn't copy-paste that from the terminal, did you
2014-09-20 16:33:33	@Espyo	you just plopped it right into your IRC client
2014-09-20 16:33:37	@J	I'm running wszst in Linux
2014-09-20 16:33:47	@Espyo	no no, the --version
2014-09-20 16:33:52	@J	oh
2014-09-20 16:33:53	@J	...
2014-09-20 16:33:53	@Espyo	did you copy-paste from the terminal to WeeChat?
2014-09-20 16:33:56	@J	yeah, of course
2014-09-20 16:33:59	@Espyo	...
2014-09-20 16:34:02	@Espyo	oh, never mind, then
2014-09-20 16:34:07	@Espyo	I thought you could pipe it to WeeChat
2014-09-20 16:34:26	@J	you could probably write a plugin to do that
2014-09-20 16:34:38	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-20 16:34:58	@J	I've never even considered it before, but it's an interesting idea
2014-09-20 16:38:54	@J	okay, so there are options for all formats but rarc, AFAICT
2014-09-20 16:39:11	@Espyo	for create? yeah, doesn't look like it
2014-09-20 16:39:20	@Espyo	but if I leave the text file, it creates a rarc by itself
2014-09-20 16:43:02	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-20 16:43:06	@Espyo	ok, so let me gather my thoughts
2014-09-20 16:44:16	@Espyo	data -> .rarc using Lunaboy's tools, and then .rarc -> .szs with Wiimms' works
2014-09-20 16:44:30	@Espyo	data -> .rarc using Wiimms' tools, and then .rarc -> .szs with szstools doesn't
2014-09-20 16:49:15	@J	I think I've managed it
2014-09-20 16:49:34	@J	yep
2014-09-20 16:49:44	@Espyo	oh?
2014-09-20 16:49:46	@J	I have no idea why, but I can't get CREATE to give me a RARC
2014-09-20 16:49:50	@J	however, UPDATE does
2014-09-20 16:50:15	@J	it's a bit weird, and I don't really understand how to use it properly, but just extract, then update the files, then run UPDATE on the rarc you extracted from
2014-09-20 16:50:24	@J	then you can COMPRESS
2014-09-20 16:50:31	@Espyo	hm, let me try
2014-09-20 16:50:49	@J	I don't know how you're doing 'data -> .rarc using Wiimms' tools'
2014-09-20 16:50:52	@J	because I just can't
2014-09-20 16:52:27	@Espyo	wish I could tell you, but I have no idea either
2014-09-20 16:53:03	@Espyo	wait wait
2014-09-20 16:53:07	@Espyo	if I do update
2014-09-20 16:53:09	@Espyo	I get a .szs
2014-09-20 16:53:14	@Espyo	...what the hell
2014-09-20 16:54:01	@J	what
2014-09-20 16:54:09	@Espyo	and it works!
2014-09-20 16:54:13	@Espyo	I absolutely cannot even
2014-09-20 16:54:27	@Espyo	I think the thing is the .txt file
2014-09-20 16:54:28	@Espyo	do you have it?
2014-09-20 16:54:34	@J	I remove it every time
2014-09-20 16:54:37	@Espyo	don't!
2014-09-20 16:54:39	@Espyo	that's just it
2014-09-20 16:54:44	@J	what
2014-09-20 16:54:45	@J	why
2014-09-20 16:54:50	@Espyo	the file contains info on what the original formats were
2014-09-20 16:54:53	@Espyo	and when you do update
2014-09-20 16:54:54	@Espyo	it fixes them
2014-09-20 16:55:01	@Espyo	they don't get added to the game
2014-09-20 16:55:10	@J	that's crazy
2014-09-20 16:55:19	@J	it should do what I want, not what it thinks it wants
2014-09-20 16:55:21	@Espyo	like, when you're done and put them in-game, the game ONLY has a .bmg and a (whatever the other one is)
2014-09-20 16:55:32	@Espyo	what's bothering you about the file?
2014-09-20 16:55:40	@Espyo	...wait
2014-09-20 16:55:41	@Espyo	it didn't work
2014-09-20 16:55:50	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 didn't crash, but it didn't update the text either
2014-09-20 16:55:55	@J	[16:55:19] @J it should do what I want, not what it thinks it wants
2014-09-20 16:56:03	@J	hmm
2014-09-20 16:56:15	@J	well, good luck working that out
2014-09-20 16:56:16	@Espyo	so the file is bothering you... because the file is bothering you
2014-09-20 16:56:47	@Espyo	...
2014-09-20 16:56:50	@Espyo	I opened vanilla P2
2014-09-20 16:57:10	@Espyo	I swear Dolphin switches them up from time to time
2014-09-20 16:57:17	@Espyo	I have two Pikmin 2 ISOs, one vanilla, one for experiments
2014-09-20 16:57:23	@Espyo	and on Dolphin's ISO list
2014-09-20 16:57:31	@Espyo	it just randomly picks which one to put where
2014-09-20 16:57:35	@Espyo	they're always together
2014-09-20 16:57:45	@Espyo	but the edited one is sometimes the top one, sometimes the bottom one
2014-09-20 16:57:54	@J	no, it's bothering me because it changes the behaviour of the program
2014-09-20 16:58:06	@J	(according to you)
2014-09-20 16:58:13	@Espyo	you're insane
2014-09-20 16:58:22	@Espyo	and for the record: it worked
2014-09-20 16:58:34	@J	yeah, it would be nice if Dolphin showed you the ISO path
2014-09-20 16:58:38	@Espyo	very
2014-09-20 16:58:45	@Espyo	or at least if I could change the edited game's name...
2014-09-20 16:58:49	@Espyo	tried with gcr, never worked
2014-09-20 16:58:52	@J	I think GCEdit does that with 0.4.1, not sure which version you have
2014-09-20 16:59:07	@Espyo	 0.4.0
2014-09-20 16:59:24	@Espyo	recap: if I use Wiimms' SZS Tools to extract a .szs with EXTRACT
2014-09-20 16:59:30	@Espyo	then edit the files, then do UPDATE on the .szs
2014-09-20 16:59:34	@Espyo	without doing anything else
2014-09-20 16:59:37	@J	oh, I never released 0.4.1
2014-09-20 16:59:38	@Espyo	I can put it in-game and it'll work
2014-09-20 16:59:40	@Espyo	silly
2014-09-20 16:59:46	@J	oh, wait, I did
2014-09-20 16:59:49	@Espyo	silly silly
2014-09-20 16:59:55	@Espyo	I haven't updated mine in ages
2014-09-20 17:00:09	@Espyo	so ok, I guess we fixed how to edit .szs, and it's several times easier than it should be
2014-09-20 17:00:15	@Espyo	but there's the other problem...
2014-09-20 17:00:18	@J	[16:55:19] @J it should do what I want, not what it thinks it wants
2014-09-20 17:00:20	@J	...
2014-09-20 17:00:21	@Espyo	nobody can really add them unless they install your program
2014-09-20 17:00:22	@J	wrong paste
2014-09-20 17:00:23	@J	https://github.com/ikn/gcedit/blob/master/CHANGES
2014-09-20 17:00:40	@Espyo	only gcedit can increase the ISO size
2014-09-20 17:00:52	@Espyo	and because the Pikmin 2 devs used black magic compression levels
2014-09-20 17:01:00	@Espyo	any .szs created by Wiimms' will always be larger
2014-09-20 17:01:35	@Espyo	* bug: sometimes trying to cancel an operation causes random errors
2014-09-20 17:01:38	@Espyo	wait, was this fixed or introduced?
2014-09-20 17:01:44	@J	...
2014-09-20 17:01:52	@J	fixed, of course
2014-09-20 17:02:01	@Espyo	"of course"
2014-09-20 17:02:04	@J	yeah, who knows what algorithm Nintendo has for SZS packing
2014-09-20 17:02:16	@Espyo	Mozilla posts the introduced bugs whenever Firefox updates, alongside the fixes and stuff
2014-09-20 17:02:35	@J	but that would be in a 'known bugs' sections, not in with the good stuff
2014-09-20 17:02:45	@Espyo	of course
2014-09-20 17:02:50	@Espyo	but Mozilla does it anyway
2014-09-20 17:03:07	@Espyo	ok, so... what can people do except install your tool?
2014-09-20 17:03:17	@Espyo	I don't even care much about it crashing when you drag
2014-09-20 17:03:19	@J	yeah, no idea
2014-09-20 17:03:23	@Espyo	which is still ridiculous
2014-09-20 17:03:26	@Espyo	but the file-size...
2014-09-20 17:03:31	@Espyo	installing Python is also fine
2014-09-20 17:03:33	@Espyo	but the file-size...
2014-09-20 17:03:39	@J	I don't think you need to install Python
2014-09-20 17:03:43	@J	what's the file-size?
2014-09-20 17:03:57	@Espyo	I remember back when I installed it, years ago, you gave me a 100+MB beast
2014-09-20 17:04:18	@Espyo	hey, you need to update GitHub's readme
2014-09-20 17:04:21	@Espyo	it links to your old domain
2014-09-20 17:05:48	@J	the one I have here is 8MiB
2014-09-20 17:05:51	@J	oh, really?
2014-09-20 17:06:00	@Espyo	did you give me a debugging version or something?
2014-09-20 17:06:08	@J	not sure
2014-09-20 17:06:09	@Espyo	'cause I can't really understand why else I'd have PTSD over your download
2014-09-20 17:06:15	@Espyo	well, we can try again
2014-09-20 17:06:21	@Espyo	how... does one go about getting your thing for windows
2014-09-20 17:06:38	@J	wait, how big is the archive you have at the moment?
2014-09-20 17:08:33	@Espyo	 34MB
2014-09-20 17:08:41	@J	okay, I believe what I did was: install Python 3; install http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/files/ ; copy the installed Python 3 folder into an archive with GCEdit and add a .bat file
2014-09-20 17:08:49	@J	yeah, that's what I have; it's 8 compressed
2014-09-20 17:08:54	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-20 17:08:58	@Espyo	well, it's still a bit big
2014-09-20 17:09:02	@Espyo	no solutions?
2014-09-20 17:09:13	@J	there is some probably unneeded stuff in there
2014-09-20 17:09:25	@J	I didn't bother to remove files when I saw it crashes all the time
2014-09-20 17:10:04	@J	also making the .bat not show the cmd window would be nice
2014-09-20 17:10:40	@Espyo	there's no way to
2014-09-20 17:10:50	@Espyo	also, it doesn't really crash all the time
2014-09-20 17:11:01	@Espyo	unless it crashes on complex and less-used tools
2014-09-20 17:11:08	@Espyo	because to import and save, it always worked perfectly
2014-09-20 17:11:15	@Espyo	not even aesthetic bugs or anything
2014-09-20 17:11:26	@Espyo	really, the only thing is messing with the window position and/or size
2014-09-20 17:11:33	@Espyo	if you could fix that, and clear out pointless files
2014-09-20 17:11:39	@Espyo	I think there wouldn't be much of a problem any more
2014-09-20 17:12:25	Prezintenden	why does my name turn light gray
2014-09-20 17:12:37	Prezintenden	is that for ultra-afk
2014-09-20 17:12:41	@Espyo	think so
2014-09-20 17:12:42	@Espyo	Mibbit?
2014-09-20 17:12:45	Prezintenden	yes
2014-09-20 17:12:53	@Espyo	you get that after 2 hours, I think
2014-09-20 17:13:06	@Espyo	so yeah, Wiimms' SZS Tools can do everything with .szs ultra-easily
2014-09-20 17:13:11	@Espyo	and can open BTI
2014-09-20 17:13:23	@Espyo	probably re-pack PNG to BTI too
2014-09-20 17:14:00	@J	yeah, I have no way of fixing that
2014-09-20 17:14:09	@J	my long-term plan is to rewrite the UI parts for Qt
2014-09-20 17:14:46	@Espyo	poo
2014-09-20 17:14:50	@Espyo	at least clean it up
2014-09-20 17:15:29	@Espyo	spend some 20 minutes on it or so
2014-09-20 17:15:33	@Espyo	shouldn't be that much of a time sink
2014-09-20 17:24:05	@Espyo	WHAT
2014-09-20 17:24:09	@Espyo	MY SIDES
2014-09-20 17:24:25	@Espyo	I tried editing something other than the text
2014-09-20 17:24:26	@J	hello?
2014-09-20 17:24:35	@Espyo	so I changed the Iridescent Glint Beetle's speed
2014-09-20 17:24:38	@Espyo	from 200 to 999
2014-09-20 17:24:42	@Espyo	IT WENT SO FAST IT FLEW
2014-09-20 17:24:46	@J	how
2014-09-20 17:24:53	@Espyo	I DON'T KNOW, MAN
2014-09-20 17:25:26	@Espyo	it
2014-09-20 17:25:29	@Espyo	it just fell from the ground
2014-09-20 17:25:33	@Espyo	*from the air

2014-09-20 17:33:34	@Espyo	I can't
2014-09-20 17:39:21	@J	that's great
2014-09-20 17:39:24	@J	now do it with RLL
2014-09-20 17:40:36	@Espyo	aye
2014-09-20 17:40:49	@Espyo	but first, I'm trying Pinball Mode
2014-09-20 17:40:54	@Espyo	please don't crash...
2014-09-20 17:41:03	@Espyo	it didn't
2014-09-20 17:41:11	@Espyo	but I don't think it did my changes either
2014-09-20 17:41:21	@Espyo	it didn't
2014-09-20 17:41:26	@J	hmm?
2014-09-20 17:41:37	@Espyo	I tried changing Novice Training to only have 1 room
2014-09-20 17:41:42	@Espyo	and no treasures
2014-09-20 17:41:45	@Espyo	but it ignored me
2014-09-20 17:42:00	@Espyo	...
2014-09-20 17:42:02	@Espyo	let me guess
2014-09-20 17:42:07	@Espyo	dammit Dolphin
2014-09-20 17:42:10	@Espyo	I picked vanilla P2 again
2014-09-20 17:42:33	@Espyo	just wish the title theme didn't run at 12fps
2014-09-20 17:43:26	@Espyo	all right, didn't crash, but there are no items
2014-09-20 17:43:28	@Espyo	or enemies
2014-09-20 17:43:31	@Espyo	probably not enough space for all
2014-09-20 17:45:12	@Espyo	no IGB
2014-09-20 17:45:15	@Espyo	maybe I made it TOO fast
2014-09-20 17:54:03	@Espyo	oh c'mon, I didn't even resize your program this time
2014-09-20 17:54:06	@Espyo	I just clicked the window

2014-09-20 18:20:27	@Espyo	I right-clicked the title bar of gcedit
2014-09-20 18:20:31	@Espyo	it froze
2014-09-20 18:20:34	@Espyo	tried to open task manager
2014-09-20 18:20:38	@Espyo	task manager itself froze, and knew it did
2014-09-20 18:20:42	@Espyo	then everything just froze everywhere
2014-09-20 18:20:46	@Espyo	couldn't even do a normal shutdown
2014-09-20 18:20:54	@Espyo	you sure you can't fix this by updating all of your libraries?

2014-09-20 18:33:41	Testyo	Good evening everyone!
2014-09-20 18:40:20	@J	no, even recent versions have the crash
2014-09-20 18:40:44	@J	GTK just doesn't really support Windows any more
2014-09-20 18:40:52	@J	plus it breaks API every now and then
2014-09-20 18:40:54	@J	really useful
2014-09-20 18:41:21	@Espyo	dammit...
2014-09-20 18:41:37	@Espyo	all right, as I was saying...
2014-09-20 18:41:43	@Espyo	RLL with huge foot swing now

2014-09-20 18:46:01	@J	okay, why doesn't every game have all this configuration in plain text
2014-09-20 18:46:14	@Espyo	we have to make a difference
2014-09-20 18:46:17	@Espyo	I know I am, with the engine
2014-09-20 18:46:29	@J	you can just tell the devs were doing this sort of craziness all the time
2014-09-20 18:46:36	@Espyo	I know!
2014-09-20 18:48:44	@Espyo	I'm so glad these files have comments
2014-09-20 18:48:49	@Espyo	for one thing, they help you understand what to do
2014-09-20 18:49:04	@Espyo	for another, when you add too many characters because you increased a value, you can just cut down on comments

2014-09-20 19:05:16	@J	well, I really need to eat
2014-09-20 19:05:20	@J	but I have a thing
2014-09-20 19:05:31	@J	it's the latest version, but it's bigger
2014-09-20 19:05:45	@J	I removed some stuff, but if you feel like it you can try removing more
2014-09-20 19:05:56	@Espyo	I wouldn't know where to begin
2014-09-20 19:05:57	@J	(just delete a file, run it to see if it crashes, repeat...)
2014-09-20 19:05:59	@Espyo	how's it bigger?
2014-09-20 19:06:12	@J	because I guess last time I went through and deleted stuff
2014-09-20 19:06:24	@J	a large part I removed was language files for lots of libraries
2014-09-20 19:06:32	@J	I left in en, en-GB and pt
2014-09-20 19:06:41	@J	I mean, I was just doing it quickly
2014-09-20 19:06:51	@J	also, it still opens a cmd window
2014-09-20 19:07:08	@J	and the gcedit.exe is hard to find amid a load of other files
2014-09-20 19:07:11	@Espyo	still don't get how it's bigger
2014-09-20 19:07:19	@J	and I think there's no exe icon
2014-09-20 19:07:27	@J	it should be smaller if you remove stuff
2014-09-20 19:07:51	@Espyo	but aren't you removing?
2014-09-20 19:08:04	@J	need to eat
2014-09-20 19:08:09	@J	I mean, I'm not finished
2014-09-20 19:08:11	@J	also lazy
2014-09-20 19:08:40	@Espyo	|:
2014-09-20 19:08:49	@Espyo	I STILL don't know how it's bigger
2014-09-20 19:08:53	@Espyo	unless you added stuff
2014-09-20 19:08:58	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/gcedit-win-0.4.1-next.zip
2014-09-20 19:08:59	@Espyo	which is the exact opposite of removing
2014-09-20 19:09:07	@J	[19:06:12] @J because I guess last time I went through and deleted stuff
2014-09-20 19:09:22	@Espyo	how does deleting INCREASE IT?!
2014-09-20 19:09:42	@J	'last time'
2014-09-20 19:09:49	@J	as opposed to this time
2014-09-20 19:09:52	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-09-20 19:09:56	@Espyo	all right
2014-09-20 19:10:00	@Espyo	then why are they back in this version?
2014-09-20 19:10:10	@J	because I redid it differently
2014-09-20 19:10:30	@J	I updated GCEdit, Python and GTK
2014-09-20 19:10:48	@Espyo	all right
2014-09-20 19:10:57	@Espyo	but I don't feel like doing it either
2014-09-20 19:11:02	@Espyo	plus what if stuff crashes LATER
2014-09-20 19:12:18	@J	wait a few minutes before downloading
2014-09-20 19:12:32	@J	I started uploading a version without the cmd
2014-09-20 19:12:43	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-20 19:12:52	@J	but it would be good to know if it works for you

2014-09-20 21:49:37	@Espyo	all right, makes sense to keep it then

2014-09-20 21:52:14	@Espyo	I'm guessing that's saved on appdata?

2014-09-21 01:48:18	@PikFan	went to a baby shower, then took a nap
2014-09-21 01:50:20	@PikFan	so I played P3 while at my aunt's house
2014-09-21 01:51:16	@PikFan	I redid day 10, because somehow the Lesser Mock Bottom wound up in the water
2014-09-21 01:51:44	@PikFan	failed object placement is failed

2014-09-21 01:54:29	@Espyo	wow, that's weird
2014-09-21 01:54:40	@PikFan	playing P3, yes

2014-09-21 01:59:45	@PikFan	so this is what I did:
2014-09-21 02:00:01	@PikFan	I carried the LMB to near the red bridge
2014-09-21 02:00:18	@PikFan	(I think I left it on the bridge, not sure)
2014-09-21 02:00:35	@PikFan	then the next day, it's in the water

2014-09-21 02:02:34	@Espyo	how weird
2014-09-21 02:02:35	@PikFan	seeing all the Nintendo Land and SSB articles, we'll have to make icons for those
2014-09-21 02:02:40	@Espyo	point this down somewhere, it might be useful later
2014-09-21 02:02:47	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2014-09-21 02:02:52	@Espyo	wait, SSB articles?
2014-09-21 02:02:56	@Espyo	like 2 of them?
2014-09-21 02:03:08	@PikFan	well, yeah
2014-09-21 02:03:18	@PikFan	hmmmm
2014-09-21 02:03:26	@PikFan	well, maybe we don't have to
2014-09-21 02:03:33	@PikFan	since there's only 2
2014-09-21 02:03:43	@PikFan	but definitely Nintendo Land
2014-09-21 02:03:47	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2014-09-21 02:04:32	@PikFan	...dammit

2014-09-21 02:05:28	@PikFan	guess it has to fully upload before I can shut off the Wii U

2014-09-21 02:13:13	@Espyo	going to bed now
2014-09-21 02:13:15	@Espyo	pretty tired
2014-09-21 02:13:17	@Espyo	oh!
2014-09-21 02:13:21	@Espyo	wait, some things you need to check
2014-09-21 02:13:33	@Espyo	I won't be waiting for your answer, but I'll let you know you need to do them anyway
2014-09-21 02:13:52	@Espyo	for one thing, check, and CAREFULLY POINT DOWN the name of the golden Kiwi in your US version of Pikmin 3
2014-09-21 02:14:25	@Espyo	secondly, on its Fruit File, check if "Tell me, Ms. Fauna, if you are indeed animal and not vegetable, Where are your legs?!" this is said, but the "Where" starts with an uppercase
2014-09-21 02:14:34	@Espyo	we need to know if this is a game typo or a Pikmin Wiki typo
2014-09-21 02:14:54	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-21 02:14:55	@Espyo	third, lock-on to the Bugeyed Crawmad and CAREFULLY POINT DOWN its name as it appears on your game
2014-09-21 02:15:23	@Espyo	fourth, check the Data File for it, and check if both the Data File's title and the description call it "Bugeyed", "Bug-Eyed" or "Bug-eyed"
2014-09-21 02:15:34	@Espyo	we need to get to the bottom of this
2014-09-21 02:15:46	@PikFan	oh, remembered
2014-09-21 02:15:50	@Espyo	point it down on a notepad or text file, or something
2014-09-21 02:15:52	@Espyo	and let me know tomorrow

2014-09-21 02:16:23	@Espyo	never collected it on my game, so can't double-check the PAL name

2014-09-21 02:17:22	@Espyo	if that's true, we should name the article after the US title

2014-09-21 15:01:29	Miles	Espyo: Do you know you can play a game on Dolphin straight from the extracted files without rebuilding an ISO?
2014-09-21 15:02:55	@Espyo	since which version?
2014-09-21 15:03:16	Miles	It's not anything new
2014-09-21 15:03:27	@Espyo	never really heard of it
2014-09-21 15:03:28	@Espyo	gotta check
2014-09-21 15:04:25	Miles	Options > Configure > Paths
2014-09-21 15:04:50	Miles	DVD root is the folder with the extracted files, Apploader is the apploader file
2014-09-21 15:05:04	Miles	Then you just open the game's .dol
2014-09-21 15:05:52	@Espyo	awesome
2014-09-21 15:15:30	@Espyo	err
2014-09-21 15:15:37	@Espyo	stack overflow while extracting the ISO
2014-09-21 15:15:40	@Espyo	even though it's still going
2014-09-21 15:30:51	@Espyo	hmm, doesn't look like it's working
2014-09-21 15:30:55	@Espyo	black screen
2014-09-21 15:33:21	Miles	What version of the game are you using?
2014-09-21 15:34:14	Miles	I know I wasn't able to get PAL Prime 1 and 2 to work
2014-09-21 15:34:27	@Espyo	PAL Pikmin 2
2014-09-21 15:34:43	Miles	Guess it's a PAL thing in general
2014-09-21 15:34:49	Miles	Has to be some way to fix it :\
2014-09-21 15:34:58	@Espyo	drat
2014-09-21 15:35:07	@Espyo	I'll try some US version
2014-09-21 15:58:08	@Espyo	works with US Pikmin 1
2014-09-21 16:52:31	@J	well, tried to use Qt and I think I discovered 3 bugs related to icon lookup
2014-09-21 16:52:37	@J	and the internet doesn't mention any of them

2014-09-21 21:55:15	@J	well, I managed to get this far:
2014-09-21 21:55:16	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/gcedit-qt.png
2014-09-21 21:55:26	@J	it's such slow progress
2014-09-21 21:55:37	@J	mostly because the Qt API is so big and complicated
2014-09-21 21:55:58	@J	but I can't complain that it doesn't let me do exactly what I want to in almost every case
2014-09-21 21:57:20	@J	for example: the table has no grid lines; the last column is ellipsised when it gets small on the start of the text; I don't draw a cell focus rectangle, only a whole-row selection rectangle
2014-09-21 21:57:54	@Espyo	I bet
2014-09-21 21:58:08	@Espyo	though if we could get EU ISOs to run on Dolphin uncompressed
2014-09-21 21:58:14	@Espyo	your program would be less useful
2014-09-21 21:58:28	@Espyo	hey, that's pretty cool
2014-09-21 21:59:28	@J	hey, you can't say that after you motivated me to fix it
2014-09-21 22:00:05	@J	besides, my file manager is better than the Windows file manager
2014-09-21 22:12:11	@Espyo	no doubt about it

2014-09-22 23:17:14	@J	(like a text area, web page, table, etc.)
2014-09-22 23:19:45	@Espyo	the window menu
2014-09-22 23:19:49	@Espyo	rarely a context menu
2014-09-22 23:19:54	@Espyo	I can't test because this keyboard doesn't have that key

2014-09-23 21:18:57	@Espyo	all right, do you know of any GIMP plugin or feature or something
2014-09-23 21:19:18	@Espyo	where you can feed it like 5 game screenshots
2014-09-23 21:19:22	@Espyo	same game, same HUD
2014-09-23 21:19:28	@Espyo	and then choose an area around the HUD element you want
2014-09-23 21:19:37	@Espyo	and it compares all 5 screenshots, and keeps only the pixels that are the same?
2014-09-23 21:19:43	@Espyo	'cause if it doesn't exist, I'll probably make it
2014-09-23 21:19:50	@Espyo	it'll make cropping stuff out of stuff so much better
2014-09-23 21:20:57	@Espyo	hm, basically comparison between several images

2014-09-23 22:59:42	@J	I'm not sure you described that very well
2014-09-23 23:00:21	@J	so if one image differs from the rest, it gives you no data?
2014-09-23 23:00:29	@J	I'm not seeing the use case
2014-09-23 23:00:41	@J	Image Magick might be able to do what you want, though
2014-09-23 23:08:04	@Espyo	it's probably better explained with an image
2014-09-23 23:08:06	@Espyo	gimme a bit
2014-09-23 23:13:43	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/diff.png like this
2014-09-23 23:25:22	@J	and you want the red thing?
2014-09-23 23:25:38	@J	yeah, Image Magick can probably do it, but it might take some reading to work out how
2014-09-23 23:26:08	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-09-23 23:26:28	@J	use the 'compare' tool
2014-09-23 23:26:54	@J	for example, this, which I found in my history, just checks if the images are exactly the same:
2014-09-23 23:26:55	@J	compare src.gif dest.gif -metric rmse null:
2014-09-23 23:27:08	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-23 23:27:15	@Espyo	but it's not quite what I want
2014-09-23 23:28:38	@J	no, that's just what I had in my history
2014-09-23 23:29:03	@J	I think the default behaviour is to generate an image as the comparison result
2014-09-23 23:29:45	@Espyo	all right
2014-09-23 23:30:34	@J	http://i.imgur.com/r1lGQaT.png
2014-09-23 23:30:38	@J	great images

2014-09-24 14:56:19	@Espyo	hey
2014-09-24 14:57:13	@Espyo	(work call, away for a few)
2014-09-24 14:57:53	@PikFan	so I can kinda understand why you took off the Mission Mode—okay—and Bingo Battle locations in the infoboxes, but honestly I feel this is too far: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Fruit&curid=9459&diff=139813&oldid=139735
2014-09-24 14:59:18	@PikFan	if you're going to do that you may as well do it here, too http://www.pikminwiki.com/Piklopedia#Locations
2014-09-24 15:06:18	Miles	Yes it includes the 3 bottles you start with, if you get half a fruit then you get half its juice
2014-09-24 15:11:54	@Espyo	I agree, we have no need for the locations
2014-09-24 15:11:58	@Espyo	it's an awkward table, and rarely
2014-09-24 15:12:00	@Espyo	*rarely read
2014-09-24 15:12:11	@Espyo	if people really want to know where they can find an enemy, they can use the enemy's article
2014-09-24 15:12:19	@Espyo	Miles: thanks!
2014-09-24 15:12:31	@Espyo	what about the grapes?
2014-09-24 15:12:46	@Espyo	what if you collect one grape? do you get like 0.025 juice or something?
2014-09-24 15:13:07	Miles	You would get .05 of a bottle of juice yes
2014-09-24 15:13:09	Miles	How useful
2014-09-24 15:14:01	@Espyo	hence the question
2014-09-24 15:14:12	@Espyo	if of the entire cluster of grapes, you collect one, what happens?
2014-09-24 15:14:24	@Espyo	does it get canceled by the end of the day, and you end up as if you hadn't collected any?
2014-09-24 15:14:52	@Espyo	or does it get recorded, and when you come back the next day, the cluster doesn't have that one grape any more? and hence, you only get the juice when the last grape is delivered?
2014-09-24 15:14:53	Miles	No
2014-09-24 15:15:07	Miles	You get the juice from the single grape
2014-09-24 15:15:09	Miles	All .05 of it
2014-09-24 15:15:21	@Espyo	oh, I thought you were asking a rhetorical question then
2014-09-24 15:15:26	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-09-24 15:18:18	@PikFan	Espyo: why do you think that?
2014-09-24 15:18:24	@PikFan	maybe people do look at it
2014-09-24 15:18:25	@Espyo	think what?
2014-09-24 15:18:32	@Espyo	I really doubt it
2014-09-24 15:18:44	@Espyo	try to imagine someone really interested in knowing where every enemy is, all at once
2014-09-24 15:18:51	@Espyo	no doubt some people want to know where some enemies are
2014-09-24 15:18:52	@PikFan	this is another thing we'll have to ask the community
2014-09-24 15:21:55	@PikFan	in the meantime, I'm taking more screenshots
2014-09-24 15:22:18	@PikFan	also I realized I missed a few in the previous areas, so I'll have to go through and see which ones I missed
2014-09-24 15:26:03	@PikFan	I think I got most of the GoH's fruits
2014-09-24 15:26:27	@PikFan	hop into Drive real quick
2014-09-24 15:30:56	@PikFan	48/66
2014-09-24 15:31:31	@Espyo	(busy, can't talk)
2014-09-24 15:31:35	@PikFan	start merging the fruits articles again after I upload these to the wiki
2014-09-24 15:31:38	@PikFan	you just did
2014-09-24 15:31:52	@PikFan	*fruit articles
2014-09-24 17:13:13	@Espyo	I'm not merging fruit articles
2014-09-24 17:13:27	@Espyo	right, I was gonna say
2014-09-24 17:13:31	@Espyo	no doubt some people will want to know
2014-09-24 17:13:44	@Espyo	for instance, they have an incomplete Piklopedia, and want to know where to find a Shoot
2014-09-24 17:13:51	@Espyo	but for that, they can use the actual article
2014-09-24 17:14:51	@Espyo	having a list of locations is just as useful as having a list of the max carriers or the notes
2014-09-24 17:14:56	@Espyo	they're better off being in the article
2014-09-24 17:19:12	@Espyo	each cluster of grapes has 20 grapes, right?

2014-09-24 20:02:12	@Espyo	I think Image Magick failed me
2014-09-24 20:04:59	@J	I looked and there were clearly downloads separately labeled 'source' and 'Windows binary'

2014-09-24 20:05:50	@Espyo	the website changed, I swear
2014-09-24 20:43:56	@Espyo	I had some nice ideas for the wiki today
2014-09-24 20:44:09	@Espyo	drawing parallels between real world measurements and measurements in the Pikmin games
2014-09-24 20:44:20	@Espyo	like, how big is the Awakening Wood IRL?
2014-09-24 20:44:27	@Espyo	spans a meter? two? five?
2014-09-24 20:45:06	@Espyo	also, bomb rocks in P3 destroy concrete
2014-09-24 20:45:18	@Espyo	we just need to know how strong concrete is and we know how destructive they are
2014-09-24 20:59:13	@Espyo	well, Image Magick compared
2014-09-24 20:59:15	@Espyo	but it wasn't quite what I wanted

2014-09-24 21:10:51	@Espyo	I'd take less making my own thing
2014-09-24 21:15:02	@J	if you say so
2014-09-24 21:31:40	@J	I just tried to put on a jumper by putting my head through the head hole from the top
2014-09-24 21:32:07	@Espyo	there's a first for everything

2014-09-24 21:32:21	@Espyo	I'm uh... guessing a jumper's just a sweatshirt
2014-09-24 21:32:29	@Espyo	or maybe it's related to a bouncer
2014-09-24 21:48:05	@J	yeah
2014-09-24 21:48:07	@J	one of those
2014-09-24 21:48:19	@Espyo	uh...
2014-09-24 21:48:25	@Espyo	how do I calculate how similar three colors are
2014-09-24 21:48:38	@J	I thought you just wanted exact matching
2014-09-24 21:48:38	@Espyo	there's probably a simple equation, but I'm not feeling it
2014-09-24 21:48:41	@Espyo	no no 
2014-09-24 21:48:44	@Espyo	well, yes
2014-09-24 21:48:48	@Espyo	but it won't be very useful
2014-09-24 21:48:55	@Espyo	I'd like some threshold
2014-09-24 21:49:04	@Espyo	also to keep the image, not tint it in red
2014-09-24 21:49:11	@Espyo	Image Magick PROBABLY does what I want

2014-09-24 21:49:14	@J	I'm not sure what people actually do, but you could do a rms kind of thing

2014-09-24 21:49:30	@J	sqrt((r1 - r2) ^ 2 + (g1 - g2) ^2 + ...)
2014-09-24 21:49:30	@Espyo	you said a word I don't recognize, so it's not what I want
2014-09-24 21:49:38	@Espyo	er
2014-09-24 21:49:41	@Espyo	not visually
2014-09-24 21:49:42	@Espyo	like
2014-09-24 21:49:52	@Espyo	 1 1 1 is the same as 1 1 1 and 1 1 1
2014-09-24 21:50:04	@Espyo	 1 1 1, 2 2 2 and 3 3 3 are a bit different

2014-09-24 21:50:36	@J	'not visually'?
2014-09-24 21:50:57	@Espyo	like, I don't want something like "orange is more similar to yellow than yellow is to dark yellow"
2014-09-24 21:51:01	@Espyo	I just care about raw values
2014-09-24 21:51:09	@Espyo	it's a bit tough to explain, and not even I'm sure of it

2014-09-24 21:51:41	@J	but it doesn't matter that red equates to the colour red
2014-09-24 21:51:42	@Espyo	I'm thinking of doing an average between all of a certain index
2014-09-24 21:51:50	@J	having different red values makes them different
2014-09-24 21:51:57	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-09-24 21:52:01	@Espyo	but what about the other indexes?
2014-09-24 21:52:07	@J	indexes?
2014-09-24 21:52:10	@J	you mean channels?
2014-09-24 21:52:15	@Espyo	uh, that
2014-09-24 21:52:22	@Espyo	always tried searching for that word
2014-09-24 21:52:24	@J	what do you mean?
2014-09-24 21:52:34	@J	I gave an equation that takes into account all the channels
2014-09-24 21:52:48	@Espyo	too complex
2014-09-24 21:52:50	@Espyo	probably
2014-09-24 21:53:12	@J	what about its complexity makes it unsuitable?
2014-09-24 21:53:34	@Espyo	nothing
2014-09-24 21:53:44	@Espyo	but if I wanted complex, I'd read Image Magick's documentation
2014-09-24 21:53:54	@Espyo	I just want to do crazy science here
2014-09-24 21:53:59	@J	I mean, what about it being 'complex' makes you not want to use it?
2014-09-24 21:54:10	@J	too slow, you don't understand it, what?
2014-09-24 21:54:18	@Espyo	just the fact that I want to do this casually, don't feel like diving into making this a powerful tool
2014-09-24 21:54:23	@J	wait
2014-09-24 21:54:29	@Espyo	don't want to spend time thinking about complex formulas
2014-09-24 21:54:32	@Espyo	even if they just SEEM complex
2014-09-24 21:54:38	@J	but you asked for an equation
2014-09-24 21:54:43	@J	it actually doesn't get much simpler
2014-09-24 21:54:53	@J	it's like one line of code
2014-09-24 21:55:09	@J	you could've implemented it in the time you spent complaining about how complex it is
2014-09-24 21:55:16	@Espyo	problem: it's not three colors
2014-09-24 21:55:17	@Espyo	it's n
2014-09-24 21:55:31	@J	I gave a comparison between 2 colours
2014-09-24 21:55:45	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-24 21:55:54	@J	so you want two things: comparison between pairs of colours, and adding those comparisons
2014-09-24 21:56:16	@Espyo	kinda?
2014-09-24 21:56:24	@Espyo	ok, given n pixels
2014-09-24 21:56:25	@J	but it depends what behaviour you really want
2014-09-24 21:56:30	@Espyo	I want how similar they are
2014-09-24 21:56:38	@Espyo	wait, there's probably a very easy way
2014-09-24 21:56:40	@Espyo	ugh
2014-09-24 21:56:51	@J	how does (4 being the same and one being different) compare to (5 being all slightly different)?
2014-09-24 21:57:12	@Espyo	 64 64 64, 70 70 70 and 71 71 71; three colors
2014-09-24 21:57:24	@Espyo	 70 - 64 = 6; 71 - 70 = 1
2014-09-24 21:57:29	@Espyo	these colors are 7 indexes apart
2014-09-24 21:57:34	@Espyo	*7 values
2014-09-24 21:57:39	@Espyo	it's that easy
2014-09-24 21:57:40	Testyo	Espyo is flooding!
2014-09-24 21:57:43	@Espyo	lies, Testyo
2014-09-24 21:57:44	Testyo	windows is trying to assume it's speculation
2014-09-24 21:57:51	@Espyo	lolwut
2014-09-24 21:58:08	@J	so you're taking the range on each channel?
2014-09-24 21:58:27	@Espyo	pretty much
2014-09-24 21:58:32	@Espyo	see, I was overcomplicating
2014-09-24 21:58:32	@J	0, 5, 10, 20 is the same as 0, 0, 0, 20?
2014-09-24 21:58:35	@Espyo	I KNEW it was simple
2014-09-24 21:58:39	@Espyo	no no no
2014-09-24 21:58:44	@Espyo	that's comparing the difference between each channel
2014-09-24 21:58:57	@Espyo	all right, I know what to do, it's better to show the final result
2014-09-24 21:59:13	@J	no, I gave 4 pixels like you did, only I didn't write identical RGB for each
2014-09-24 21:59:23	@J	so I meant: 0 0 0, 5 5 5, 10 10 10, ...
2014-09-24 21:59:32	@Espyo	oh
2014-09-24 21:59:47	@Espyo	they're... not the same?
2014-09-24 21:59:56	@J	20 - 0 = 20 - 0
2014-09-24 22:00:00	@J	that's your equation, right?
2014-09-24 22:00:07	@Espyo	where in the world did you...
2014-09-24 22:00:07	@Espyo	what
2014-09-24 22:00:09	@Espyo	J, please
2014-09-24 22:00:11	@Espyo	my head hurts now
2014-09-24 22:00:25	@J	[21:57:24] @Espyo  70 - 64 = 6; 71 - 70 = 1
2014-09-24 22:00:39	@Espyo	forget what the equation is, imagine these colors:
2014-09-24 22:00:52	@J	given a <= b <= c, you're taking (c - b) + (b - a)
2014-09-24 22:01:02	@J	that clearly = c - a
2014-09-24 22:01:02	@Espyo	 1, 4, 10
2014-09-24 22:01:07	@J	so who cares what b is
2014-09-24 22:01:23	@Espyo	these colors score a 7 in the difference scale
2014-09-24 22:01:30	@Espyo	 1, 20, 30
2014-09-24 22:01:40	@Espyo	these score 29 in the difference scale
2014-09-24 22:01:46	@J	wait, 7?
2014-09-24 22:02:01	@Espyo	the difference between the first and second
2014-09-24 22:02:06	@Espyo	and the difference between the second and third
2014-09-24 22:02:08	@J	4 - 1 = 3
2014-09-24 22:02:17	@Espyo	err, 9
2014-09-24 22:02:20	@J	...
2014-09-24 22:02:21	@Espyo	where did I get that 7 from?
2014-09-24 22:02:23	@J	so, like I was saying
2014-09-24 22:02:31	@J	1, x, 10 gives 9 for all x
2014-09-24 22:02:37	@Espyo	hmm, you're right
2014-09-24 22:02:40	@Espyo	then something's off
2014-09-24 22:02:43	@Espyo	because...
2014-09-24 22:02:49	@Espyo	uh, because what
2014-09-24 22:02:53	@Espyo	all right, I think I know what I need
2014-09-24 22:02:56	@Espyo	I need a pivot image
2014-09-24 22:02:59	@J	okay, trust me on this
2014-09-24 22:03:06	@Espyo	because yeah, 1, 2, 10 is no different from 1, 9, 10
2014-09-24 22:03:08	@Espyo	and it probably should
2014-09-24 22:03:13	@J	wait, I forgot what I was going to suggest
2014-09-24 22:03:20	@J	you infiltrated me with your crazy
2014-09-24 22:03:22	@Espyo	using Image Magick?
2014-09-24 22:03:25	@J	no
2014-09-24 22:03:31	@Espyo	this is the best idea I've ever had
2014-09-24 22:03:31	@J	I was going to suggest an equation
2014-09-24 22:03:33	@Espyo	can't stop laughing
2014-09-24 22:03:53	@J	yeah, take standard deviation in each channel, then sum
2014-09-24 22:04:14	@J	that's exactly what you want
2014-09-24 22:04:25	@J	it doesn't matter if you use hsv or rgb either
2014-09-24 22:05:00	@Espyo	yeah, I'm pretty sure it's something of the sort
2014-09-24 22:05:07	@Espyo	but HOW does one get the standard deviation?
2014-09-24 22:05:30	@J	sqrt((sum of squares) / number of pixels)
2014-09-24 22:05:43	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-24 22:05:48	@Espyo	so basically, your thing from before
2014-09-24 22:05:52	@Espyo	right, I knew it had to be easy
2014-09-24 22:05:52	@J	so 1 4 10 gives sqrt((1 + 16 + 100) / 3)
2014-09-24 22:06:02	@J	sometimes you use one more on the bottom
2014-09-24 22:06:13	@J	as in, sqrt(sum / (n + 1))
2014-09-24 22:06:16	@Espyo	ah
2014-09-24 22:06:20	@J	or, sqrt((1 + 16 + 100) / 4)
2014-09-24 22:06:24	@J	not sure why
2014-09-24 22:06:28	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-24 22:07:04	@J	uh
2014-09-24 22:07:08	@J	okay, may be crazy
2014-09-24 22:07:12	@J	I forgot most of the equation
2014-09-24 22:07:19	@Espyo	isn't there more to it?
2014-09-24 22:07:19	@J	let me try again
2014-09-24 22:07:22	@Espyo	I just barely remember this
2014-09-24 22:07:24	@Espyo	from college
2014-09-24 22:08:14	@J	sqrt(sum(pixel - mean) / n)
2014-09-24 22:08:29	@J	...
2014-09-24 22:08:33	@Espyo	now the mean's in on it too?
2014-09-24 22:08:33	@J	sqrt(sum(pixel - mean) ^ 2 / n)
2014-09-24 22:09:00	@Espyo	wait wait, define pixel
2014-09-24 22:09:08	@J	value of the pixel in this channel
2014-09-24 22:09:23	@Espyo	I do that for every one?
2014-09-24 22:09:25	@Espyo	doesn't sound right
2014-09-24 22:09:35	@J	sqrt(((1 - 5)^2 + (4 - 5)^2 + (10 - 5)^2) / 3)
2014-09-24 22:09:42	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-24 22:09:44	@J	yeah, I think so
2014-09-24 22:10:02	@Espyo	maybe I really just need highest - lowest
2014-09-24 22:10:08	@Espyo	let me try a sketch, see if it makes sense
2014-09-24 22:10:14	@Espyo	all right, maybe I'm better off explaining it fully
2014-09-24 22:10:31	@Espyo	you know how initially I was meant to crop the fruit icons out of map screenshots?
2014-09-24 22:10:38	@Espyo	(Pikmin 3)
2014-09-24 22:10:53	@Espyo	if I had several images of the same fruit, I could run a script like this that'd just crop out all that's similar — the icon
2014-09-24 22:11:18	@Espyo	but of course, it'll be hard to find screenshots where the background ALWAYS changes
2014-09-24 22:11:22	@Espyo	so some pixels will be similar
2014-09-24 22:11:35	@Espyo	if this is too different, it needs to be background, but if it's too similar, it's probably the icon
2014-09-24 22:11:43	@Espyo	instead of having a threshold, we could have it fuzzy
2014-09-24 22:12:07	@J	oh, I thought you were going to say something else
2014-09-24 22:12:15	@J	yeah, that was pretty obvious from what you were asking
2014-09-24 22:12:21	@Espyo	instead of "this pixel is like 1% different in all images, it's background/icon", we could have "this is between 2% and 0% different, so I guess I'll make it half transparent"
2014-09-24 22:12:58	@Espyo	hm, but I probably do want that equation
2014-09-24 22:13:05	@Espyo	suppose we have 6 images
2014-09-24 22:13:13	@Espyo	 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255
2014-09-24 22:13:36	@Espyo	just because one of them's the black sheep, the max - min method will make this pixel be "128 values different"
2014-09-24 22:13:46	@Espyo	whereas it should be more like an average
2014-09-24 22:14:06	@Espyo	yeah, that's it, an average
2014-09-24 22:15:56	@J	with 255 the standard deviation would still be quite high, though
2014-09-24 22:16:12	@J	did you expect it to give 0 for that, or what?
2014-09-24 22:16:26	@Espyo	probably around 40
2014-09-24 22:16:42	@J	to get 0 you could run something like, 'remove all the pixels further than x standard deviations from the mean', then compute the standard deviation again
2014-09-24 22:17:00	@Espyo	let me try average for now
2014-09-24 22:17:09	@Espyo	in fact, let me try ANYTHING, I'm not actually getting progress done
2014-09-24 22:17:11	@J	plain standard deviation gives 95 for those
2014-09-24 22:17:16	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-24 22:17:19	@Espyo	probably good
2014-09-24 22:17:27	@Espyo	this is mostly just to keep a few edge-case pixels as transparent
2014-09-24 22:17:34	@Espyo	doesn't really need to be extreme
2014-09-24 22:29:09	@Espyo	crash
2014-09-24 22:29:42	@Espyo	oh, forgot to say "here goes"
2014-09-24 22:38:32	@Espyo	keeps crashing for some reason
2014-09-24 22:38:38	@Espyo	can't create the final image
2014-09-24 22:38:40	@Espyo	Allegro shenanigans
2014-09-24 22:39:04	@Espyo	...oh
2014-09-24 22:39:12	@Espyo	it's creating a bitmap that's trillions of pixels huge
2014-09-24 22:39:25	@Espyo	how is my RAM even alive?
2014-09-24 22:40:19	@Espyo	ok, it works
2014-09-24 22:40:22	@Espyo	but the result is nothing
2014-09-24 22:41:24	@J	nice job
2014-09-24 22:41:30	@Espyo	Allegro stores colors in memory using 0-1
2014-09-24 22:41:37	@Espyo	I was doing the stuff based on 0-255
2014-09-24 22:41:45	@Espyo	HAH!
2014-09-24 22:41:46	@Espyo	it worked!
2014-09-24 22:43:27	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-09-24 22:44:28	@Espyo	oh right, the stupid integer division integer result
2014-09-24 22:44:49	@Espyo	it actually worked
2014-09-24 22:44:53	@Espyo	time to try something on a bigger scale
2014-09-24 22:53:21	@Espyo	hey, it actually did a good job
2014-09-24 22:55:14	@Espyo	and naturally, the higher the discard threshold, the more accurate it gets
2014-09-24 22:57:01	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Image_comparison.7z
2014-09-24 23:11:35	@J	hmm, not bad
2014-09-24 23:11:59	@Espyo	better than I expected
2014-09-24 23:12:04	@Espyo	and it does exactly what I wanted it to
2014-09-24 23:12:08	@Espyo	so I guess my work here is done
2014-09-24 23:12:15	@Espyo	for every pixel
2014-09-24 23:12:18	@Espyo	for every source image
2014-09-24 23:12:27	@Espyo	for every channel
2014-09-24 23:12:56	@Espyo	add to a sum, and decide what's the highest and lowest value
2014-09-24 23:13:30	@Espyo	then, for every channel sum, get the "average difference"
2014-09-24 23:13:41	@Espyo	this is just average - lowest
2014-09-24 23:13:51	@Espyo	and then the usual, if it goes over a threshold, discard
2014-09-24 23:14:02	@Espyo	if not, draw it, and the lower the "average difference", the more opaque

2014-09-24 23:30:25	@J	why do GUI toolkits make it so hard to make a dialogue without a default button
2014-09-24 23:30:33	@J	ie. pressing enter/space does nothing
2014-09-24 23:30:41	@J	couldn't manage in GTK at all
2014-09-24 23:30:53	@Espyo	bleh, that sucks
2014-09-24 23:30:55	@J	in Qt, for some reason I can make it so that enter does nothing, but space does something
2014-09-24 23:31:02	@Espyo	that
2014-09-24 23:31:04	@Espyo	shouldn't be a thing
2014-09-24 23:31:44	@J	your algorithm sounds very suspicios
2014-09-24 23:31:47	@J	*suspicious
2014-09-24 23:32:09	@Espyo	as in it shouldn't work whatsoever?
2014-09-24 23:32:18	@J	I think you said it wrong anyway
2014-09-24 23:32:24	@J	are the 'for's the wrong way around?
2014-09-24 23:32:39	@Espyo	nope
2014-09-24 23:32:41	@Espyo	I'll send you it
2014-09-24 23:33:13	@Espyo	actually, let me try something
2014-09-24 23:33:25	@J	wait, why do you determine max if you then only use average and min
2014-09-24 23:33:48	@Espyo	yeah, leftover
2014-09-24 23:34:01	@J	it says it failed

2014-09-24 23:36:36	@Espyo	ah, good
2014-09-24 23:36:44	@J	[23:33:42]  weechat xfer: incoming file from Espyo (0.0.0.0, irc.darkmyst), name: main.cpp_199, 233 bytes (protocol: dcc)
2014-09-24 23:36:44	@J	[23:33:51]  weechat =!= xfer: unable to connect to sender

2014-09-24 23:36:45	@Espyo	closed the tab before getting a response from the server, was worried
2014-09-24 23:36:59	@Espyo	yeah, I told you, it's a leftover
2014-09-24 23:37:06	@Espyo	as for the file, really no idea what happened
2014-09-24 23:37:53	@J	waaaaaaait
2014-09-24 23:38:24	@J	oh, never mind, I thought src.size() was number of pixels
2014-09-24 23:39:00	@J	yeah, this is really strange
2014-09-24 23:39:06	@J	it's asymmetric
2014-09-24 23:39:22	@J	like, f(0, 0, 255) != f(0, 255, 255)
2014-09-24 23:39:34	@J	...I think
2014-09-24 23:39:42	@J	it's late, not sure if I'm thinking clearly
2014-09-24 23:40:07	@J	yeah, I'm right
2014-09-24 23:40:22	@J	one of those is twice as 'different' as the other
2014-09-24 23:40:29	@J	('varied', maybe)
2014-09-24 23:42:12	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-09-24 23:42:15	@Espyo	it's meant to
2014-09-24 23:42:43	@Espyo	compared to 0, 0, 0
2014-09-24 23:42:50	@Espyo	 0, 0, 255 is "different"
2014-09-24 23:42:54	@Espyo	 0, 255, 255 is "twice as different"
2014-09-24 23:43:00	@J	uh
2014-09-24 23:43:01	@J	...
2014-09-24 23:43:13	@J	then is (255, 255, 255) three times as different?
2014-09-24 23:43:22	@J	because that looks like 'exactly the same' to me
2014-09-24 23:43:23	@Espyo	yep
2014-09-24 23:43:34	@J	wait
2014-09-24 23:43:37	@J	hmm
2014-09-24 23:43:39	@Espyo	how is 0,0,0 exactly the same as 255,255,255
2014-09-24 23:43:40	@J	I'm doing it again
2014-09-24 23:43:44	@J	let me explain my notation
2014-09-24 23:43:58	@J	the three numbers are 3 pixels in different images in the same channel
2014-09-24 23:44:04	@Espyo	ah, right, right
2014-09-24 23:44:09	@J	red1 = 0, red2 = 0, red3 = 255
2014-09-24 23:44:19	@J	is less different from 0, 255, 255
2014-09-24 23:44:53	@Espyo	uh
2014-09-24 23:45:11	@Espyo	I can't really think about it, my brain's too tired
2014-09-24 23:45:17	@Espyo	I just know it somehow worked
2014-09-24 23:45:38	@J	average - min = (255 / 3) - 0, or (510 / 3) - 0
2014-09-24 23:45:40	@Espyo	that reminds me, I should add a comment saying //To future Espyo: This works. Do not touch. You'll thank me.
2014-09-24 23:46:14	@J	you should append to the end of that, 'yes, I am crazy'
2014-09-24 23:46:25	@Espyo	more like "no, I don't know how either"
2014-09-24 23:46:43	@Espyo	it's close to being a haiku
2014-09-24 23:46:44	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-09-24 23:46:52	@Espyo	how does it go again? 7, 9, 7?
2014-09-24 23:46:59	@Espyo	or was it 3 5 3?
2014-09-24 23:47:27	@Espyo	 5 7 5
2014-09-24 23:48:03	@Espyo	Future Espyo.
2014-09-24 23:48:06	@Espyo	Do not touch this crazy code.
2014-09-24 23:48:26	@Espyo	You will thank me later.
2014-09-24 23:48:40	@Espyo	it's hard to tell if the last is 5 or 7 syllables
2014-09-24 23:52:58	@J	it's clearly 6
2014-09-24 23:54:05	@Espyo	You-will-thank-me-la-ter
2014-09-24 23:54:09	@Espyo	crap, how did I count 5?
2014-09-24 23:54:13	@J	because crazy
2014-09-24 23:54:27	@Espyo	I counted "later" as one
2014-09-24 23:54:29	@Espyo	more than once
2014-09-24 23:54:32	@Espyo	every time in my head
2014-09-24 23:54:33	@Espyo	bleh, sleep
2014-09-24 23:54:38	@Espyo	sleep sounds good about now

2014-09-26 20:19:45	@Espyo	oh, and Testyo complained about fanon
2014-09-26 20:19:47	Testyo	I figured slock would you print 76 lines?
2014-09-26 20:19:51	@Espyo	oh yeah, the thing I sent on my work laptop
2014-09-26 20:19:53	@Espyo	well, yeah, we
2014-09-26 20:19:59	@Espyo	for the most part, we need to change the background
2014-09-26 20:24:45	@J	hmm
2014-09-26 20:34:21	@J	so I just learned that floating point numbers don't store the first bit in the mantissa
2014-09-26 20:34:27	@J	because it's always 1
2014-09-26 20:39:04	@Espyo	wish I knew what a mantissa is
2014-09-26 20:39:17	@Espyo	I probably do, but
2014-09-26 20:41:51	@J	the part that isn't the exponent
2014-09-26 20:42:01	@J	x in x*2^y
2014-09-26 20:43:45	@J	ooh, that's actually quite nice
2014-09-26 20:44:06	@J	my energy company generates a graph of my energy usage along with the outdoors temperature
2014-09-26 20:45:04	@Espyo	so you can compare what temperatures mean what energy usage?
2014-09-26 20:46:06	@J	yeah
2014-09-26 20:46:38	@J	2 line graphs overlaid on top of each other, on a scale of months
2014-09-26 20:47:18	@Espyo	hm, that's pretty snazzy

2014-09-26 22:37:14	@Espyo	the guy that made the Python szs thing is working on the BMS Pikmin 2 format
2014-09-26 22:37:16	@Espyo	I think I said before
2014-09-26 22:37:22	@Espyo	but what place could he put the documentation at?
2014-09-26 22:37:30	@Espyo	I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to have it on the wiki
2014-09-26 22:37:51	@Espyo	only problem would really be having... you know, documentation on a proprietary format via reverse-engineering
2014-09-26 22:52:53	@J	what's wrong with that?
2014-09-26 22:57:06	@Espyo	yeah, considering we're already uploading textures and other reverse-engineering-only data
2014-09-26 22:57:13	@Espyo	but you know RE is illegal in America
2014-09-26 22:57:38	@Espyo	they might go from "meh, it's a wiki, we'll ignore it" to "they're actively reverse-engineering, these monsters need to be stopped"
2014-09-26 23:14:54	@J	that's not true
2014-09-26 23:15:53	@J	...at least, I hope it's not
2014-09-26 23:17:42	@Espyo	it's Nintendo
2014-09-26 23:17:52	@Espyo	but then again, they'd have to cut off Dolphin before us
2014-09-26 23:20:02	@J	I meant the legality part
2014-09-26 23:23:30	@Espyo	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering#United_States
2014-09-26 23:24:18	@Espyo	heck, forget US
2014-09-26 23:24:20	@Espyo	look at Europe
2014-09-26 23:24:28	@Espyo	>and also prohibits the public release of information obtained through reverse engineering of software.
2014-09-26 23:25:16	@J	it says that was overriden by a 2009 law
2014-09-26 23:26:18	@Espyo	been a while since I read that article
2014-09-26 23:26:24	@Espyo	but it's still in my history, specially that section
2014-09-26 23:26:35	@Espyo	(the link on the index is purple)
2014-09-26 23:27:05	@Espyo	ugh, a bit long
2014-09-26 23:27:15	@Espyo	but I guess it means that it's ok, as long as you don't use it to damage the company?
2014-09-26 23:27:28	@Espyo	still, I'm not sure
2014-09-26 23:27:36	@Espyo	like, of course Nintendo'd go after Dolphin first
2014-09-26 23:27:55	@Espyo	between us reverse-engineering their 10-year old deprecated MIDI format
2014-09-26 23:28:02	@Espyo	and people reverse-engineering the entire console...s
2014-09-26 23:28:11	@Espyo	of course they want to get rid of the latter
2014-09-26 23:28:34	@J	it basically all says it's fine to make the file formats work with other programs, so long as you're not competing
2014-09-26 23:29:12	@J	I mean, there are even larger examples of products that _do_ compete - practically every office suite supported MS Office formats before they were open specifications
2014-09-26 23:29:45	@Espyo	that's true
2014-09-26 23:29:49	@Espyo	I guess it's fine
2014-09-26 23:30:01	@Espyo	I think we're just overthinking it
2014-09-26 23:30:10	@J	there was a thing a while back about a guy writing a Skype replacement
2014-09-26 23:30:14	@Espyo	it's legal enough, Nintendo barely cares, and if they do, we won't be the first targets
2014-09-26 23:30:53	@J	I think Skype went after him, then some stuff happened, then he changed his process to writing documentation from reverse engineering, then having someone else write code from that, and it was fine or something
2014-09-26 23:31:22	@Espyo	lolwut
2014-09-26 23:31:27	@Espyo	law is complicated
2014-09-26 23:32:09	@Espyo	what would the page be?
2014-09-26 23:32:15	@Espyo	I'm gonna tell him to add it to the wiki
2014-09-26 23:32:19	@Espyo	should the page even be mainspace?
2014-09-26 23:32:38	@Espyo	I've been thinking for a while about adding the format of area, cave, enemy, etc. config files, too
2014-09-26 23:33:56	@J	wouldn't it make more sense on TCRF
2014-09-26 23:33:57	@J	?
2014-09-26 23:34:02	@Espyo	it's not unused
2014-09-26 23:35:46	@J	is that all TCRF is for?
2014-09-26 23:35:57	@J	I thought it was a general thing for internals
2014-09-26 23:36:18	@Espyo	nope, just unused stuff, really
2014-09-26 23:36:29	@Espyo	hence stuff that didn't make it past the cutting room floor
2014-09-26 23:36:41	@J	hmm
2014-09-26 23:37:02	@J	well, no other namespaces make sense unless we create a new one
2014-09-26 23:37:22	@J	if it were relevant to another page, I would say create a subpage, but it's not
2014-09-26 23:37:47	@Espyo	a namespace that just documents the internals of the games
2014-09-26 23:37:50	@J	I mean, we have a music page (right?) so that stuff could've gone under there, but if you were thinking SZS, etc. stuff too
2014-09-26 23:38:12	@Espyo	the file formats, the text file legends, and the ISO tree
2014-09-26 23:38:13	@J	TBH, it might make sense to have a separate wiki entirely, just because it would be quite different
2014-09-26 23:38:17	@Espyo	well, I was thinking just BMS
2014-09-26 23:38:25	@Espyo	'cause this strand of BMS is pretty darn Pikmin 2 specific
2014-09-26 23:38:33	@Espyo	it would be quite different
2014-09-26 23:38:36	@Espyo	but creating a wiki JUST for it
2014-09-26 23:38:38	@J	and any actually relevant parts can be mentioned on Pikipedia
2014-09-26 23:38:46	@Espyo	we already have two wikis

2014-09-26 23:39:00	@Espyo	could as well be as a subpage of [[music]], really

2014-09-26 23:39:12	@J	I mean, it doesn't have to be a a wiki with a community in the sense of other wikis
2014-09-26 23:39:19	@Espyo	or maybe something in the vein of [[Pikmin 2 enemy properties]]?

2014-09-26 23:39:40	@Espyo	yeah, but we wouldn't have much more than just... the BMS Pikmin 2format

2014-09-26 23:39:59	@J	[23:32:38] @Espyo I've been thinking for a while about adding the format of area, cave, enemy, etc. config files, too
2014-09-26 23:40:17	@J	plus the page you just linked
2014-09-26 23:40:36	@Espyo	but I'm not fond of the idea of creating (plus setting up!) an entirely new wiki
2014-09-26 23:40:46	@Espyo	really would rather just have a namespace
2014-09-26 23:40:49	@Espyo	or just keep stuff in subpages
2014-09-26 23:45:12	@J	could just use a GitHub wiki

2014-09-27 12:53:11	@Espyo	I wanted to sleep more, if it didn't overlap with my everything else
2014-09-27 12:53:24	@Espyo	wait
2014-09-27 12:53:27	@Espyo	that's exactly what "only" means
2014-09-27 12:53:32	@Espyo	let's rewind, shall we
2014-09-27 12:53:38	@Espyo	<J> what's this, only 12 hours' sleep?
2014-09-27 12:53:49	@Espyo	yep, had to wake up, or else I'd lose control
2014-09-27 12:53:54	@Espyo	there's always tomorrow to sleep the rest
2014-09-27 13:03:19	@Espyo	that's weird, shouldn't reverted edits be auto-patrolled?
2014-09-27 13:03:39	@Espyo	I know I reverted a few in my day, and they got auto-patrolled, but all of these that PikFan reverted I'm marking as patrolled manually right now
2014-09-27 13:05:31	@J	should just depend on whether the user is autopatrolled
2014-09-27 13:05:36	@J	I thought PikFan was, though
2014-09-27 13:05:48	@J	rollback, or revert?  Revert is exactly the same as any other edit
2014-09-27 13:06:38	@Espyo	yeah, he was
2014-09-27 13:06:42	@J	yeah, he still is
2014-09-27 13:06:49	@Espyo	rollback does auto-patrol, that I'm sure of
2014-09-27 13:06:57	@Espyo	but I'm also pretty darn sure that reverts do too
2014-09-27 13:07:11	@Espyo	I don't usually rollback because I like to give a reason with my reversion
2014-09-27 13:07:13	@Espyo	so I use revert
2014-09-27 13:07:16	@J	looks like those were rollbacks to me
2014-09-27 13:07:23	@J	yeah, rollback is intended for spam
2014-09-27 13:07:27	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-27 13:07:32	@Espyo	but yeah, rollbacks SHOULD patrol
2014-09-27 13:07:57	@J	yeah, I would've expected them to

2014-09-27 22:22:28	@J	2014-03-14 23:02:02     @J      hmm, the personal links don't really look very clear with any colour
2014-09-27 22:22:28	@J	2014-03-14 23:02:07     @J      maybe they need a background
2014-09-27 22:22:28	@J	2014-03-14 23:03:18     @Espyo  white bolded is ok

2014-09-27 22:29:25	@J	as it is in that screenshot, or as it is now?
2014-09-27 22:29:39	@J	because looking at it now won't help decide when the background's changed
2014-09-27 22:30:01	@J	either way, I have some other changes I saved, and I'll put them altogether and show you
2014-09-27 22:30:07	@J	...tomorrow afternoon

2014-09-27 22:37:25	@Espyo	I know, but it's actually not
2014-09-27 22:37:28	@Espyo	check Common.css
2014-09-27 22:37:29	@Espyo	it's not there
2014-09-27 22:44:06	@J	it is for me
2014-09-27 22:44:56	@Espyo	wha
2014-09-27 22:44:58	@Espyo	what line?
2014-09-27 22:45:15	@J	oh, you mean the background's not there...
2014-09-27 22:45:19	@J	I thought you meant the page
2014-09-27 22:45:23	@J	let me check
2014-09-27 22:45:39	@Espyo	yeah, the background
2014-09-27 22:45:49	@J	it's on monobook.css

2014-09-27 22:46:42	@Espyo	monobook.css is empty for me
2014-09-27 22:46:52	@J	might need M

2014-09-27 22:47:30	@J	no

2014-09-27 22:47:53	@Espyo	yeah, the first letter can be upper or lower
2014-09-27 22:47:56	@Espyo	mediawiki is fine with it
2014-09-27 22:48:04	@Espyo	but any letter afterwards has to match case
2014-09-27 22:48:07	@Espyo	and I was using an upper B

2014-09-27 22:48:29	@J	I thought I heard once that there was a special case for some skin files, though

2014-09-28 01:27:13	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-09-28 01:27:25	Los_Plagas	I introducted a friend of mine who liked Mother 3 (that is the game, right?) 
2014-09-28 01:27:29	Los_Plagas	to PK Rhythm
2014-09-28 01:27:46	@Espyo	yeah, Mother 3
2014-09-28 01:27:48	@Espyo	nice!
2014-09-28 01:28:07	Los_Plagas	yeah, he's utterly obsessed with it
2014-09-28 01:28:18	Los_Plagas	He wanted to know if you're still developing it
2014-09-28 01:29:15	Los_Plagas	so yeah, just figured I'd drop it to let you know someone appreciates PK Rhythm
2014-09-28 01:29:21	Los_Plagas	I dunno how popular it actually is

2014-09-28 15:06:15	@Espyo	uh, we were meant to use the wikia background
2014-09-28 15:06:16	@Espyo	at least for now
2014-09-28 15:06:23	@Espyo	so that people who come from wikia don't get shell shocked
2014-09-28 15:06:41	@Espyo	but between the two, I like the latter better
2014-09-28 15:10:52	@J	wait, what?
2014-09-28 15:11:09	@J	okay, I never heard of this
2014-09-28 15:13:00	@Espyo	I said it at least two times
2014-09-28 15:13:15	@Espyo	probably also used the expression "shell shock" in one of them
2014-09-28 15:16:29	@J	wait, their background is fixed and tiled
2014-09-28 15:17:51	@J	...oh, I keep forgetting that ctrl-q closes all windows with Firefox
2014-09-28 15:18:10	@J	wondered why the windows in other workspaces suddenly disappeared
2014-09-28 15:19:32	@Espyo	hehe
2014-09-28 15:19:42	@Espyo	being fixed by itself should be fine
2014-09-28 15:19:43	@Espyo	also centered
2014-09-28 15:22:12	@J	no, it should be top-aligned
2014-09-28 15:22:41	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User account ShaniceSMAT created http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User:ShaniceSMAT
2014-09-28 15:23:15	@J	okay, it looks like they added the green themselves
2014-09-28 15:23:25	@J	but the image is much lower quality than the source
2014-09-28 15:23:30	@J	eg. http://imguol.com/c/entretenimento/2013/06/12/pikmin-3-1371045569038_1920x1080.jpg
2014-09-28 15:24:08	@J	on the other hand, perhaps it should be - you don't really notice it, and we can't very well have a 700+KiB image as the background
2014-09-28 15:24:52	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2014-09-28 15:37:07	@J	http://i.imgur.com/p6IJgdd.png
2014-09-28 15:37:12	@J	you get that on very large screens
2014-09-28 15:41:06	@Espyo	hmmm...
2014-09-28 15:41:11	@Espyo	what can we do?
2014-09-28 15:41:14	@Espyo	tile?
2014-09-28 15:41:21	@Espyo	is stretching an option?
2014-09-28 15:41:49	@J	I think it looks okay
2014-09-28 15:41:54	@J	http://i.imgur.com/6Q4GOO6.jpg http://i.imgur.com/WVXRk1L.jpg
2014-09-28 15:42:25	@J	could align it left, so that happens at the bottom and right instead of the bottom and sides
2014-09-28 15:42:54	@Espyo	yeah, agreed
2014-09-28 15:43:09	@Espyo	so that's the same shade of green as the image's "fog"?
2014-09-28 15:43:12	@J	yeah
2014-09-28 15:43:14	@Espyo	it's hard to tell on the screenshots
2014-09-28 15:43:14	@Espyo	all right
2014-09-28 15:43:25	@Espyo	looks good then, but yeah, should be on the right and bottom
2014-09-28 15:43:44	@Espyo	we'll probably end up with a tileable background in the future, like the grass we were aiming for
2014-09-28 15:43:47	@Espyo	but for now, we need this
2014-09-28 15:43:54	@J	and how much content background transparency? (those last 2 links)
2014-09-28 15:44:09	@Espyo	I think the latter works better
2014-09-28 15:44:16	@Espyo	I can ask the others
2014-09-28 15:44:26	@J	harder to read, though
2014-09-28 15:44:42	@Espyo	not really
2014-09-28 15:44:44	@Espyo	at least IMO
2014-09-28 15:44:44	@J	that's what we have currently, but our background is less busy
2014-09-28 15:44:50	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-28 15:44:52	@J	I said harder, not hard
2014-09-28 15:45:02	@Espyo	well, yeeeaaaaaaaah, but
2014-09-28 15:45:07	@Espyo	you can obviously see it's harder
2014-09-28 15:45:16	@J	also, not sure why these screenshots became jpeg
2014-09-28 15:45:19	@Espyo	but it looks a bit better to show more of the background
2014-09-28 15:45:21	@J	I guess imgur decided they should be
2014-09-28 15:45:30	@Espyo	I can see jpg artifacts
2014-09-28 15:45:36	@Espyo	weird, didn't know imgur did convert
2014-09-28 15:45:40	@J	well, see what others think
2014-09-28 15:45:55	@Espyo	they're all going for second
2014-09-28 15:46:02	@Espyo	[15:45:33] AeroBlaze777: the second looks more like how our wiki looked
2014-09-28 15:46:02	@Espyo	[15:45:40] AeroBlaze777: the page was more see through
2014-09-28 15:46:06	@Espyo	except I can't tell what he means with this
2014-09-28 15:46:28	@Espyo	he means the second one
2014-09-28 15:46:38	@Espyo	he just commented on the second, didn't actually say if he preferred, but now he confirmed
2014-09-28 15:46:41	@Espyo	so that's it
2014-09-28 15:46:47	@Espyo	hm, anything else we could change?
2014-09-28 15:46:52	@Espyo	don't see any major problem with the logo
2014-09-28 15:46:58	@Espyo	the white fade doesn't really look bad
2014-09-28 15:49:25	@J	yeah, the only change I made here was the personal links
2014-09-28 15:49:36	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-28 15:49:53	@Espyo	all right, I'm feeling it
2014-09-28 15:49:58	@Espyo	I guess you can submit
2014-09-28 15:50:10	@J	I'll give the footer the same background transparency
2014-09-28 15:50:24	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-09-28 15:50:53	@Espyo	hey, do we have any tool that shows us the number visits over the past few months?
2014-09-28 15:50:57	@J	do you think I should upload over the grass background, or separately?
2014-09-28 15:51:05	@Espyo	wikia does, and the guys there are saying Pikmin Wiki views have dropped 75%
2014-09-28 15:51:16	@J	Porple probably has stats

2014-09-28 15:51:59	@Espyo	...should be Wiki-background.jpg...

2014-09-28 15:52:18	@J	.jpg is missing
2014-09-28 15:52:21	@Espyo	I never saw that png one before
2014-09-28 15:52:26	@Espyo	missing?

2014-09-28 15:52:36	@Espyo	all right, forget my first link
2014-09-28 15:52:40	@Espyo	I THOUGHT that was the name
2014-09-28 15:52:42	@J	and your second
2014-09-28 15:52:43	@Espyo	but it turns out it was this

2014-09-28 15:53:00	@Espyo	as for that desert one, the png
2014-09-28 15:53:03	@Espyo	I never really saw it before
2014-09-28 15:59:45	@J	hmm, left aligning it shows the green under the sidebar, though

2014-09-28 16:04:10	@Espyo	can't we manually shift?
2014-09-28 16:04:23	@Espyo	I mean, tell the CSS to start at x = 150 or so
2014-09-28 16:04:59	@J	yeah
2014-09-28 16:06:32	@Espyo	oh, well
2014-09-28 16:07:14	@J	150px actually looks about right

2014-09-28 16:08:54	@J	try now
2014-09-28 16:10:49	@J	also check it's not crazy-looking in IE if you can
2014-09-28 16:11:06	@Espyo	will do
2014-09-28 16:11:21	@Espyo	looking spiffy
2014-09-28 16:12:03	@Espyo	ie behaves, but loads of things have a thick dark green border

2014-09-28 16:32:15	@Espyo	all right, we need to change the favicon from the aliased leaf to a bacopa cabana
2014-09-28 16:34:24	@J	that looks okay
2014-09-28 16:34:33	@Espyo	what does
2014-09-28 16:34:37	@J	I guess it just doesn't support outset borders for some reason
2014-09-28 16:34:38	@J	the screenshot
2014-09-28 16:34:54	@Espyo	ah
2014-09-28 16:34:58	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-09-28 16:35:00	@Espyo	>for some reason
2014-09-28 16:35:02	@Espyo	pffft hehehe, J
2014-09-28 16:35:18	@J	actually, the borders are outset, it's just the contrast is very low
2014-09-28 16:39:10	@Espyo	hm
2014-09-28 16:39:15	@Espyo	now they're discussing the front page
2014-09-28 16:39:18	@Espyo	we need a banner at the top
2014-09-28 16:58:59	@J	hmm?
2014-09-28 16:59:06	@Espyo	a banner with an image
2014-09-28 16:59:11	@Espyo	that says something like "welcome to pikipedia!"
2014-09-28 16:59:39	@J	...but it already exists in text
2014-09-28 16:59:44	@J	accessibility * 1000
2014-09-28 17:00:32	@Espyo	they want something more flashy
2014-09-28 17:00:36	@Espyo	I have to agree
2014-09-28 17:00:38	@Espyo	but not TOO flashy
2014-09-28 17:00:49	@Espyo	something that really shows that this is the entrance gate
2014-09-28 17:00:58	@Espyo	instead of just being "You are at the entrance."
2014-09-28 17:01:26	@J	it's the exact same text
2014-09-28 17:01:40	@J	so they just want to replace text with an image saying the same text
2014-09-28 17:01:50	@Espyo	more like wanting to have something more visual
2014-09-28 17:01:54	@Espyo	more Pikmin and more flowers
2014-09-28 17:01:57	@J	so we're not talking about adding any content, but changing the aesthetics
2014-09-28 17:02:07	@J	yeah, that's what I was checking
2014-09-28 17:02:08	@J	hmm
2014-09-28 17:02:36	@Espyo	pretty much
2014-09-28 17:03:03	@J	can we do image alt text in MediaWiki?
2014-09-28 17:03:24	@J	what you'd want is something like <h2><img src=...>Welcome to ...</img></h2>

2014-09-28 17:03:53	@J	oh, without |thumb

2014-09-28 17:06:58	@J	okay, that's reasonabl
2014-09-28 17:07:18	@J	are we thinking place it above the current welcome box, which we leave as-is without the first line?

2014-09-28 17:08:14	@J	we'll end up with the content further down the page, but it's the main page so it doesn't really matter, and it'll still be nowhere near as far down as Wikia
2014-09-28 17:09:40	@J	well, good luck with that
2014-09-28 17:09:55	@Espyo	they never said, but I guess it makes sense
2014-09-28 17:10:04	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-28 17:10:10	@Espyo	one of them said they had an idea

2014-09-28 22:28:06	@J	'The Empty space container is the only treasure in Pikmin 2 to not follow a Title Case, like all other treasures.' - I hate it when people do that; it just reads as condescending
2014-09-28 22:30:57	@J	'According to Olimar's Journal for the Drought Ender, Olimar cannot resist his thirst and ends up drinking most of the water in the canteen [5], despite the fact that water is consisted of oxygen and hydrogen.' - this is crazy; carbon monoxide is in the same sense 'in' all the food we eat
2014-09-28 22:31:07	@J	plus too much oxygen is bad for humans
2014-09-28 22:32:01	@J	'On Louie's Notes, he mentions several plants and vegetables on his cooking recipes, although most of these ingredients need to be cultivated with oxygen.' - I always got the impression his cooking notes were meant to advertise products you could only get from the Pikmin planet
2014-09-28 22:32:21	@J	'According to Olimar's Journal for Child of the Earth, Hocotatians do not know about potatoes. However, Louie's Notes for the Emperor Bulblax suggest cooking the beast with potatoes and carrots. [1]' - same again
2014-09-28 22:33:46	@J	all the golden stuff they have on Hocotate could just be paint for all we know
2014-09-28 22:34:56	@Espyo	hm, makes sense
2014-09-28 22:35:06	@Espyo	yeah, I did point out the gold could be something else
2014-09-28 22:35:13	@Espyo	what's wrong with Empty space container?
2014-09-28 22:35:32	@Espyo	and reword the whole Drought Ender part, because what
2014-09-28 22:36:11	@J	'In popular culture, they are also known as goofs.' - this seems unnecessary
2014-09-28 22:36:29	@Espyo	Zelda Wiki does it :(
2014-09-28 22:36:30	@J	the 'title case' part
2014-09-28 22:36:42	@J	does goofs, or does dictionary entries?
2014-09-28 22:36:50	@Espyo	does goofs
2014-09-28 22:37:01	@Espyo	I really don't see what's wrong with the "title case" part
2014-09-28 22:37:04	@J	[22:35:32] @Espyo and reword the whole Drought Ender part, because what
2014-09-28 22:37:12	@Espyo	besides the fact that I wrote "a Title Case", when I meant "a Title Case theme", or something
2014-09-28 22:37:13	@J	it's not so much a case of rewording as of throwing it out
2014-09-28 22:37:18	@Espyo	no no no
2014-09-28 22:37:22	@Espyo	I mean reword what you said about it
2014-09-28 22:37:24	@J	oh
2014-09-28 22:37:35	@J	I'm saying: replace 'Title Case' with 'title case'
2014-09-28 22:37:39	@Espyo	and yeah, naturally I stretched the content of this article
2014-09-28 22:37:46	@Espyo	hmm, all right, I agree
2014-09-28 22:37:53	@Espyo	I wasn't really feeling writing Title Case in Title Case either
2014-09-28 22:38:01	@Espyo	in that case, [[Empty space container]] here too
2014-09-28 22:38:01	Testyo	"Empty_space_container" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Empty_space_container
2014-09-28 22:38:16	@J	the grammar is iffy there anyway - you wouldn't say 'follow' title case, or 'a' title case
2014-09-28 22:38:35	@Espyo	hm, doesn't feel iffy to me
2014-09-28 22:38:39	@J	'only treasure...not to have its name in title case'
2014-09-28 22:38:41	@Espyo	not like it's one of those sentences you hear every day, but
2014-09-28 22:38:46	@Espyo	all right, that sounds good
2014-09-28 22:38:48	@J	I will now play the 'you are Portuguese card'
2014-09-28 22:38:52	@J	...
2014-09-28 22:38:59	@J	move that closing quote
2014-09-28 22:39:09	@Espyo	you may not play that card
2014-09-28 22:39:24	@J	I may and already have

2014-09-28 22:40:01	@J	I was saying, carbon monoxide is poisonous for us to breathe, but all our food contains carbon and oxygen
2014-09-28 22:40:24	@J	and also that breathing pure oxygen is poisonous to us
2014-09-28 22:40:42	@Espyo	right
2014-09-28 22:42:14	@J	you know, I never noticed half the stuff on this page
2014-09-28 22:43:38	@J	well, that's all the stuff I have to complain about, the rest looks fine
2014-09-28 22:43:47	@J	(not that I read the whole thing thoroughly)
2014-09-28 22:44:05	@Espyo	that's why I made the page
2014-09-28 22:44:08	@Espyo	it's pretty interesting
2014-09-28 22:44:36	@Espyo	all right... so your point on water?
2014-09-28 22:44:42	@Espyo	'cause I really can't figure out what your conclusion is
2014-09-28 22:44:51	@Espyo	probably makes sense, but I don't feel like thinking about chemistry right now
2014-09-28 22:45:25	@J	you're saying water should be poisonous to Hocotatians if oxygen gas is
2014-09-28 22:45:53	@J	I'm saying that it's as strong a conclusion as saying all our food is poisonous to us because carbon monoxide gas is
2014-09-28 22:46:13	@J	(hint: all our food is not poisonous to us, only the poisons)
2014-09-28 22:47:27	@Espyo	rrrright, I see now
2014-09-28 22:47:28	@Espyo	of course
2014-09-28 22:47:31	@J	you know, on a completely unrelated note, I think I've overcome my updating addiction

2014-09-28 22:48:58	@Espyo	you started doing it less and less because it was sinking your time, rihgt?
2014-09-28 22:48:59	@Espyo	*right
2014-09-28 22:49:26	@J	no
2014-09-28 22:49:33	@J	it's not like I have to watch it
2014-09-28 22:49:47	@Espyo	but having to check
2014-09-28 22:50:34	@J	you just type a thing
2014-09-28 22:50:38	@J	then stuff happens
2014-09-28 22:51:53	@Espyo	but it still takes time
2014-09-28 22:52:04	@J	yeah
2014-09-28 22:52:05	@Espyo	all right, so what was the reason?
2014-09-28 22:52:21	@J	what was the reason I stopped doing it so much?
2014-09-28 22:52:30	@J	Iunno, I didn't really try, it just happened
2014-09-28 22:53:25	@Espyo	pfft. makes sense
2014-09-28 22:55:03	@Espyo	there, don't think I broke anything

2014-09-28 22:55:21	Testyo	but what exactly is no "European" language
2014-09-28 22:55:24	@J	and he beat me
2014-09-28 22:56:03	@J	looks fine
2014-09-28 22:56:18	@Espyo	ugh, now I'm gonna go have to double check if that WFG thing is right
2014-09-28 22:56:24	@J	well, the bits you did change
2014-09-28 22:56:32	@J	I thought I brought up more stuff than that
2014-09-28 22:56:41	@Espyo	I added a note for the rest
2014-09-28 22:56:56	@Espyo	they're potential mistakes
2014-09-28 22:57:15	@J	a note?
2014-09-28 22:57:55	@J	mm, I guess it only really leaves the title case thing
2014-09-28 23:01:12	@Espyo	I did fix the title case

2014-09-28 23:09:46	@Espyo	good job
2014-09-28 23:09:59	@Espyo	I went through all cave pages, and added the numbers
2014-09-28 23:10:04	@Espyo	but I guess I must've missed those

2014-09-28 23:15:35	Ford4385	Though it is the Gamecube version
2014-09-28 23:18:11	@J	Espyo: I thought most of those numbers already existed
2014-09-28 23:18:18	@J	did you add them from the game data?
2014-09-28 23:18:36	@Espyo	what numbers
2014-09-28 23:18:41	@J	[23:09:59] @Espyo I went through all cave pages, and added the numbers
2014-09-28 23:18:47	@Espyo	well, I did
2014-09-28 23:19:48	@J	you know, I wrote a parser a while back that basically auto-generates those sections from the game files

2014-09-29 14:51:31	@PikFan	hi
2014-09-29 14:52:13	@PikFan	what discussion did I miss?
2014-09-29 14:53:12	@PikFan	I thought we were going with the one that had the grass
2014-09-29 14:53:21	@PikFan	I don't mind this one, though
2014-09-29 14:53:53	@Espyo	hi
2014-09-29 14:54:00	@Espyo	...
2014-09-29 14:54:05	@Espyo	either I'm insane and I never told you guys
2014-09-29 14:54:09	@Espyo	or I did tell you guys, and you're insane
2014-09-29 14:54:24	@Espyo	but basically, PW folk decided it would be better to keep the wikia background, for the time being
2014-09-29 14:54:33	@Espyo	newcomers who move won't feel as much of a shell shock this way
2014-09-29 14:54:42	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2014-09-29 14:54:56	@Espyo	in the future, we'll decide a better background, but for now, this works
2014-09-29 14:55:03	@PikFan	it's much better
2014-09-29 14:55:06	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-29 14:55:09	@PikFan	for now
2014-09-29 14:55:16	@Espyo	still a bit TOO flashy for my taste, but I like it a lot better than the previous one
2014-09-29 14:55:21	@Espyo	also, we started discussing a new front page
2014-09-29 14:55:26	@Espyo	I compiled my ideas into a page
2014-09-29 14:55:29	@Espyo	check the RC
2014-09-29 14:55:32	@PikFan	yeah, http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Espyo/sandbox
2014-09-29 14:55:45	@PikFan	(already was opened)
2014-09-29 14:55:47	@Espyo	the 3 Blues are gonna be replaced with some banner
2014-09-29 14:55:56	@Espyo	and some link and text is obviously placeholders
2014-09-29 14:55:57	@Espyo	thoughts?
2014-09-29 14:56:10	@PikFan	are the stars placeholders?
2014-09-29 14:56:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-29 14:56:25	@Espyo	I never got around to uploading ship part icons for some reason
2014-09-29 14:56:27	@Espyo	so I'll do it tonight
2014-09-29 14:56:34	@Espyo	still not quite sure what to do for an area icon
2014-09-29 14:56:41	@PikFan	hmm
2014-09-29 14:56:42	@Espyo	and as for Pikmin icons, loads of games have them, we'll just pick one
2014-09-29 14:57:36	@PikFan	>Sometime: An article about the camera has been created. 
2014-09-29 14:57:44	@PikFan	July 20, to be exact
2014-09-29 14:57:49	@Espyo	ah, nice
2014-09-29 14:57:54	@Espyo	heh, of course, I should've checked the history
2014-09-29 14:57:54	@PikFan	and why camera, specificlly?
2014-09-29 14:57:55	@Espyo	oh well
2014-09-29 14:57:57	@PikFan	*specifically
2014-09-29 14:58:01	@Espyo	no reason
2014-09-29 14:58:03	@Espyo	just needed something to pad
2014-09-29 14:58:11	@Espyo	but also to give out the idea that we can put new articles there
2014-09-29 14:58:21	@Espyo	because other than stuff like the move and official Pikmin announcements...
2014-09-29 14:58:25	@Espyo	that section will be EMPTY
2014-09-29 14:58:43	@Espyo	so unless we also add stuff like new articles or featured articles, we'll never update it
2014-09-29 14:58:47	@PikFan	hmm
2014-09-29 14:58:56	@Espyo	I also think we should merge the random excerpts with the featured image
2014-09-29 14:58:59	@Espyo	and just have a random content thing
2014-09-29 14:59:03	@Espyo	oh, and the image isn't featured any more
2014-09-29 14:59:04	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-29 14:59:11	@Espyo	I mean, it is, but it's a group of features, and they're picked randomly
2014-09-29 14:59:16	@PikFan	I see
2014-09-29 14:59:32	@Espyo	other than that, thoughts'
2014-09-29 14:59:33	@Espyo	*?
2014-09-29 14:59:40	@PikFan	also, you may want to go with an article like HUD or Controls
2014-09-29 14:59:46	@PikFan	instead of something like Camera
2014-09-29 15:00:04	@Espyo	it's a placeholder, remember
2014-09-29 15:00:08	@Espyo	Camera isn't particularly noteworthy
2014-09-29 15:00:10	@PikFan	I know
2014-09-29 15:00:20	@Espyo	I literally just put the first article that came to my mind, that was created recentlyish
2014-09-29 15:00:30	@Espyo	I mean, NEW new article
2014-09-29 15:00:34	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-29 15:00:36	@Espyo	not like an imported article
2014-09-29 15:00:58	@PikFan	oh, so I created a table last night of which fruit screenshots I'm missing
2014-09-29 15:01:05	@Espyo	mhm?
2014-09-29 15:01:39	@PikFan	missing 14 fruits
2014-09-29 15:02:04	@PikFan	some of those are in the previous days
2014-09-29 15:02:14	@Espyo	well, you can always go back
2014-09-29 15:02:15	@PikFan	thank goodness you can go back in time in P3
2014-09-29 15:02:17	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-29 15:02:59	@PikFan	speaking of P3, how's your 100% fruit, no death run going?
2014-09-29 15:03:47	@Espyo	haven't started
2014-09-29 15:03:53	@Espyo	not sure what to do to my old save file
2014-09-29 15:04:07	@Espyo	I mean, I'll have to start over, but
2014-09-29 15:04:08	@PikFan	mm
2014-09-29 15:04:17	@Espyo	what if I need to quickly see another day for some info for the wiki?
2014-09-29 15:04:19	@Espyo	it'll be gone
2014-09-29 15:04:28	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmm
2014-09-29 15:04:36	@Espyo	and I only played the game once, so if I need to check something, say, on the Formidable Oak's path
2014-09-29 15:04:39	@Espyo	I'll have to play a LOT
2014-09-29 15:04:43	@PikFan	this might work, but I've never tested it...
2014-09-29 15:04:47	@Espyo	whereas more experienced players won't have to play AS much
2014-09-29 15:04:53	@Espyo	I could create a new Mii account
2014-09-29 15:04:57	@PikFan	you could create another—yeah
2014-09-29 15:04:59	@Espyo	and it keeps a different save file
2014-09-29 15:05:09	@Espyo	yeah, it works; my sister has one, and mine and her MK8 accounts are different
2014-09-29 15:05:20	@Espyo	...supposedly Pikmin 3 too, but it's just that she never played it
2014-09-29 15:05:22	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-09-29 15:05:43	@PikFan	why did Nintendo only use one save file >_>
2014-09-29 15:05:50	@PikFan	absolutely ridiculous
2014-09-29 15:06:08	@Espyo	because there was no need not to
2014-09-29 15:06:12	@Espyo	want a different day? here, go back
2014-09-29 15:06:17	@Espyo	want somebody else to play? make a Mii for them
2014-09-29 15:06:20	@Espyo	everything is solved
2014-09-29 15:06:35	@Espyo	sure, experienced players may want to keep several save files
2014-09-29 15:06:38	@PikFan	no IMMEDIATE need, that is
2014-09-29 15:06:39	@Espyo	and they still CAN
2014-09-29 15:06:57	@Espyo	but remember that for the casual players, wanting to start the game and being bombarded with a question about which "save file" you want
2014-09-29 15:07:01	@Espyo	it's a bit overwhelming
2014-09-29 15:07:16	@Espyo	shouldn't be, at this day and age, but I'm willing to bet loads of people started gaming with Pikmin games
2014-09-29 15:07:34	@Espyo	so before they even know how the controls work, they're asked about "save files" and "ship logs", and creating a new one
2014-09-29 15:07:43	@PikFan	by loads of people, you mean, iunno... 4.5 million people?
2014-09-29 15:07:47	@Espyo	so I can see why Nintendo decided that you just start the game and it's your adventure, period
2014-09-29 15:07:51	@Espyo	not as many
2014-09-29 15:07:54	@Espyo	definitely not as many
2014-09-29 15:08:00	@Espyo	I mean START with a Pikmin game
2014-09-29 15:08:27	@PikFan	hm
2014-09-29 15:09:01	@Espyo	and people like speedrunners can still keep several saves
2014-09-29 15:09:07	@Espyo	(even though they can't really copy)
2014-09-29 15:09:15	@Espyo	so meh, it was the optimal solution
2014-09-29 15:09:23	@Espyo	or well, ONE optimal solution
2014-09-29 15:09:29	@Espyo	maybe there were more, but they just went with this
2014-09-29 15:09:49	@Espyo	in other news, the guy who's studying the sequenced music in Pikmin 2 can now get the files to play
2014-09-29 15:09:56	@Espyo	he's gonna make MIDI file exports really soon
2014-09-29 15:10:02	@Espyo	and when he does, I'm gonna jump at them so fast
2014-09-29 15:10:12	@Espyo	there HAS to be unused instruments in some of the songs
2014-09-29 15:10:15	@Espyo	(there HAVE to be?)
2014-09-29 15:10:36	@PikFan	hehe
2014-09-29 15:10:51	@PikFan	of course Espyo tears apart the music, too
2014-09-29 15:11:05	@Espyo	even if I don't find anything, I still want to know how it's made
2014-09-29 15:11:11	@PikFan	right, right
2014-09-29 15:11:11	@Espyo	I want to get into music composition one day
2014-09-29 15:11:18	@Espyo	and messing with others is one of the best ways
2014-09-29 15:11:24	@Espyo	certainly better than learning the THEORY, that's for sure
2014-09-29 15:11:27	@Espyo	so many terms...
2014-09-29 15:11:34	@Espyo	I'd rather just see what other songs do and learn from them
2014-09-29 15:11:45	@Espyo	melodies, harmonies, chords, ...
2014-09-29 15:11:47	@PikFan	also: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Mistakes_in_the_Pikmin_series#Oxygen and http://www.pikminwiki.com/Drought_Ender
2014-09-29 15:11:53	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-09-29 15:11:56	@Espyo	forgot to remove it in DE
2014-09-29 15:12:14	@Espyo	J made a good point: just because oxygen GAS is bad, doesn't mean oxygen molecules in water are
2014-09-29 15:12:38	@PikFan	I see
2014-09-29 15:12:40	@PikFan	yeah
2014-09-29 15:13:10	@Espyo	in other news, I'm likely getting Smash 4 on release date
2014-09-29 15:13:17	@PikFan	which version?
2014-09-29 15:13:22	@PikFan	Wii U?
2014-09-29 15:13:24	@Espyo	 3DS
2014-09-29 15:13:28	@Espyo	and Wii U
2014-09-29 15:13:34	@PikFan	oh
2014-09-29 15:14:07	@PikFan	we also need Nintendo Land
2014-09-29 15:14:56	@Espyo	yeah... but chances are I'm not getting that one
2014-09-29 15:15:08	@Espyo	parents are gonna need some of my money for the next few months (they'll pay back)
2014-09-29 15:15:17	@Espyo	and wasting money left and right on all sorts of games...
2014-09-29 15:15:30	@PikFan	not wasting
2014-09-29 15:15:31	@Espyo	plus, I'd need at least two people to learn about Pikmin Adventure
2014-09-29 15:15:39	@Espyo	and I'm not gonna tell my sister to join
2014-09-29 15:15:44	@Espyo	at most, we could play once or twice, casually
2014-09-29 15:15:57	@Espyo	but in order to get good info, I'd have to keep telling her what to do, and to constantly pause the game to point down info
2014-09-29 15:16:04	@Espyo	yeah, not wasting, but spending left and right
2014-09-29 15:16:05	@PikFan	yeah, I'm totally going to take a trip to Portugal and play with you
2014-09-29 15:16:06	@PikFan	lol
2014-09-29 15:16:19	@Espyo	Wii U, MK8, 3DS, Smash 4, Smash 4 Wii U, ...
2014-09-29 15:16:32	@Espyo	plus adding Pikmin 3 DLC and the new Binding of Isaac (I so want to get it)
2014-09-29 15:16:43	@Espyo	having to buy Nintendo Land on top of that would just be pretty bad
2014-09-29 15:16:47	@Espyo	it'd look like I'm wasting it
2014-09-29 15:16:52	@PikFan	I already downloaded the P3 DLC
2014-09-29 15:16:52	@Espyo	yeah, come over, it's better
2014-09-29 15:16:53	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-29 15:16:57	@PikFan	uh
2014-09-29 15:17:00	@PikFan	that's not creepy
2014-09-29 15:17:01	@Espyo	J should script something in Python so we can play online
2014-09-29 15:17:02	 *	@PikFan hides
2014-09-29 15:17:10	@Espyo	you were the one that suggested it :|
2014-09-29 15:17:19	@PikFan	I was kidding :|
2014-09-29 15:17:25	@Espyo	|:|
2014-09-29 15:17:26	@PikFan	anyway
2014-09-29 15:17:36	@PikFan	brb
2014-09-29 15:17:54	@Espyo	ok
2014-09-29 15:18:02	@Espyo	I'll brb too, need bathroom, ugh
2014-09-29 15:39:30	@PikFan	going now
2014-09-29 15:39:32	@PikFan	bye
2014-09-29 15:43:15	@Espyo	bye

2014-09-29 21:54:49	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Alternate_game_modes
2014-09-29 21:55:05	@J	I'd suggest renaming this to 'alternative', since it's valid in both US and GB English
2014-09-29 21:57:20	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Randomness
2014-09-29 21:57:48	@J	not sure this article is really necessary, but at the very least the 'Number generation' section isn't
2014-09-29 22:01:13	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-09-29 22:01:17	@Espyo	sssssh, it's necessary
2014-09-29 22:01:33	@Espyo	the number generation section complements it
2014-09-29 22:01:41	@Espyo	and no joke now, it is actually helpful for people who try to do TAS
2014-09-29 22:03:10	@J	only the actual numbers, the rest is obvious
2014-09-29 22:03:23	@J	rather than that, link to a Wikipedia page
2014-09-29 22:03:38	@Espyo	but I also explain how Pikmin games do it
2014-09-29 22:03:41	@Espyo	so it is a bit relevant
2014-09-29 22:04:54	@J	'Machines cannot generate random numbers from nothing. In computing, the closest equivalent to truly random numbers is to transform a "seed" number...' - not really true anyway, there are lots of hardware random number generation methods
2014-09-29 22:05:18	@J	no, it's more trying to explain general concepts using Pikmin as examples
2014-09-29 22:05:31	@J	it doesn't actually really say anything about Pikmin
2014-09-29 22:05:33	@Espyo	for the most part
2014-09-29 22:05:37	@Espyo	bleh, just get rid of it
2014-09-29 22:05:44	@Espyo	yes it does, I remember writing something
2014-09-29 22:06:07	@Espyo	 3rd paragraph
2014-09-29 22:06:51	@J	the image demonstrates the second concept as much as the first
2014-09-29 22:07:02	@J	(random based on time as much as on input)
2014-09-29 22:07:20	@J	the second part contains a 'likely', so it's obvious you don't actually know
2014-09-29 22:07:36	@J	is the first part true?  Do you have evidence?
2014-09-29 22:07:39	@Espyo	oh yeah, I remember now
2014-09-29 22:07:49	@Espyo	what, evidence for player input?
2014-09-29 22:08:03	@J	yeah
2014-09-29 22:08:14	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-09-29 22:08:30	@Espyo	I'll have to double check
2014-09-29 22:08:55	@J	I mean, in a deterministic emulator, the _only_ inputs are time and player controls
2014-09-29 22:09:13	@J	so all you're saying is 'the game probably uses the only methods available to it to generate random numbers'
2014-09-29 22:10:09	@Espyo	wait, I need to restart my rouer
2014-09-29 22:10:11	@Espyo	*router
2014-09-29 22:10:31	@Espyo	uh, never mind
2014-09-29 22:10:37	@Espyo	apparently Nintendo Network is down for everybody
2014-09-29 22:13:31	@Espyo	I meant more in the way that it definitely uses timing, but MAYBE player input
2014-09-29 22:13:39	@Espyo	I really messed up the non-list part of that article, sue m
2014-09-29 22:13:40	@Espyo	*me
2014-09-29 22:13:44	@Espyo	that's why wikis aren't a one-man job
2014-09-29 22:13:51	@Espyo	because humans are fail-prone
2014-09-29 22:15:35	@J	sure
2014-09-29 22:15:58	@J	I just feel better telling you all your mistakes rather than just going and removing stuff
2014-09-29 22:16:08	@J	because that why I get to see you try to defend yourself
2014-09-29 22:16:11	@J	it's often funny
2014-09-29 22:17:08	@Espyo	no doubt
2014-09-29 22:17:12	@Espyo	and I KNOW I'm not right
2014-09-29 22:17:24	@Espyo	which really makes me wonder about past Espyo's sanity
2014-09-29 22:17:29	@Espyo	and worried about future Espyo's
2014-09-29 22:18:51	@J	past Espyo is a lost cause

2014-09-29 22:36:50	@Espyo	...
2014-09-29 22:36:58	@Espyo	do we really never use the word "with" on the entire wiki
2014-09-29 22:37:03	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=default&search=with&fulltext=Search
2014-09-29 22:41:37	@J	clearly it's too common a word to let you search for it
2014-09-29 22:41:42	@Espyo	why
2014-09-29 22:41:55	@Espyo	I wanted to search for "instead", 'cause then I could find more oversights for the mistakes page
2014-09-29 22:41:57	@Espyo	but
2014-09-29 22:42:02	@Espyo	surely "instead" can't be THAT common
2014-09-29 22:42:08	@J	why would you want to search for with?
2014-09-29 22:42:19	@Espyo	well, not "with"
2014-09-29 22:42:40	@J	well, it probably just has a predefined list of words you can't search for
2014-09-29 22:42:50	@Espyo	after trying "instead" and getting no results, I figured "maybe we really don't say 'instead', ever; let me try something I'm sure we have to mention at least once"
2014-09-29 22:42:52	@Espyo	and here we are
2014-09-29 22:43:01	@Espyo	likely, but I don't want it
2014-09-29 22:43:09	@Espyo	maybe I can override it with a space at the end
2014-09-29 22:43:10	@Espyo	or quotes
2014-09-29 22:43:19	@J	it probably wouldn't even index the term
2014-09-29 22:44:13	@Espyo	hm, good point
2014-09-29 22:45:51	@J	best you can do is download all the pages and search them locally
2014-09-29 22:46:30	@Espyo	I
2014-09-29 22:46:33	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-29 22:52:35	@Espyo	all right, the thing needs pygame
2014-09-29 22:52:37	@Espyo	where do I put pygame
2014-09-29 22:58:48	@Espyo	J?
2014-09-29 23:08:57	@J	what thing?
2014-09-29 23:09:16	@J	probably just install it, right?
2014-09-29 23:09:42	@Espyo	wouldn't it want the source code?
2014-09-29 23:09:54	@Espyo	I mean, I'm running a Python script, not a Python... uh, executable...
2014-09-29 23:09:59	@J	installing installs the source code
2014-09-29 23:10:09	@Espyo	fair enough
2014-09-29 23:13:33	@Espyo	hmm, bad pointer to portmidi
2014-09-29 23:15:32	@Espyo	might need a reboot
2014-09-29 23:15:36	@Espyo	wouldn't be surprised
2014-09-29 23:20:12	@J	portmidi is what Pygame uses to do MIDI
2014-09-29 23:20:21	@J	so I guess the install messed up somehow
2014-09-29 23:20:34	@J	anyway, I'm going to go now, so bye

2014-09-30 20:28:50	Yoshi2	good day, Testyo & Espyo 
2014-09-30 20:28:51	Testyo	I activate Meisterbot?
2014-09-30 20:29:04	@Espyo	no, Testyo, don't be silly
2014-09-30 20:29:05	Testyo	suddenly this guy comes up and buoyant are related
2014-09-30 20:29:05	@Espyo	hey there
2014-09-30 20:31:35	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'm the guy who works on the python projects for decoding/encoding yaz0 files and playing BMS files (debugyoshi) :)
2014-09-30 20:31:46	@Espyo	haha, thought so
2014-09-30 20:31:49	@Espyo	welcome!
2014-09-30 20:31:56	Yoshi2	thanks
2014-09-30 20:32:02	@Espyo	I was just thinking about that, actually
2014-09-30 20:32:14	@Espyo	I tried it yesterday, and it did work, but only for songs starting in ff
2014-09-30 20:32:25	Yoshi2	recently I've done a bit more testing with it
2014-09-30 20:32:52	Yoshi2	there are basically two groups of BMS files in Pikmin 2, the "simple" ones and the "complicated" ones
2014-09-30 20:33:06	@Espyo	all right, hang on, something isn't right
2014-09-30 20:33:08	@Espyo	I have to restart windows
2014-09-30 20:33:14	@Espyo	it goofed up somewhere, my settings are all gone
2014-09-30 20:33:26	Yoshi2	alright, see you

2014-09-30 20:43:31	@Espyo	thanks, but I don't think that did the trick
2014-09-30 20:43:39	@Espyo	hm, or maybe it did
2014-09-30 20:47:10	Yoshi2	well, let's make the most out of the time before windows breaks again
2014-09-30 20:47:36	@Espyo	...it forgot half of my settings
2014-09-30 20:47:43	@Espyo	I'm betting half of my %appdata% is gone
2014-09-30 20:47:45	@Espyo	I...
2014-09-30 20:47:46	@Espyo	wow
2014-09-30 20:47:49	Yoshi2	very odd
2014-09-30 20:48:12	Yoshi2	I don't think that is supposed to happen
2014-09-30 20:49:35	@J	it'd be great if it were
2014-09-30 20:49:43	@Espyo	...great
2014-09-30 20:49:58	@Espyo	don't take joy in my suffering just because you use Linux, all right
2014-09-30 20:50:05	@Espyo	and my %appdata% is there, intact
2014-09-30 20:50:13	@Espyo	so why in the world is windows doing this
2014-09-30 20:50:23	@J	you know there are no pre-requisites to taking joy in your suffering
2014-09-30 20:50:32	Yoshi2	what settings are you talking about?
2014-09-30 20:50:40	@Espyo	stuff stored in the appdata folder
2014-09-30 20:51:10	Yoshi2	I see
2014-09-30 20:54:23	Yoshi2	Espyo: these files are the ones that I'd put in the "complicated" category: http://pastebin.com/NNUVs5RG
2014-09-30 20:54:38	@Espyo	hmm, I see
2014-09-30 20:54:51	@Espyo	yeah, all of the area themes are there, just as I thought
2014-09-30 20:55:42	Yoshi2	they probably contain additional data for playing special music when playing as Louie, or when approaching enemies
2014-09-30 20:56:22	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-30 20:56:26	@Espyo	there's some data on...
2014-09-30 20:56:27	@Espyo	let me check
2014-09-30 20:57:09	@Espyo	on the disc's Totaka and Wakai folders
2014-09-30 20:58:35	Yoshi2	ah, text files related to the music files
2014-09-30 21:01:20	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-30 21:01:27	@Espyo	can't make heads or toes of them, though
2014-09-30 21:01:47	Yoshi2	one of the reasons why I would call these BMS files complicated is that they don't have events for defining all tracks in the very first track
2014-09-30 21:02:01	@Espyo	ouch
2014-09-30 21:02:44	Yoshi2	instead, they have an odd 0xB1 event whose function I have yet to figure out
2014-09-30 21:03:01	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-30 21:03:07	@Espyo	I suppose the other guy didn't know either
2014-09-30 21:04:11	Yoshi2	I have not asked him about that event yet
2014-09-30 21:06:10	@Espyo	hmm
2014-09-30 21:06:14	Yoshi2	on the other hand, I think all the BMS files that are not on that list play just fine :)
2014-09-30 21:06:25	@Espyo	at least that's always good
2014-09-30 21:06:32	@Espyo	I tried the ff_ ones and they all ran
2014-09-30 21:06:43	@Espyo	Python always threw me a null pointer error with the midi player, but eh
2014-09-30 21:06:47	Yoshi2	yeah
2014-09-30 21:07:10	Yoshi2	that is not a bad thing, I'm just not shutting down the midi player correctly
2014-09-30 21:08:08	@Espyo	ah, all right
2014-09-30 21:08:28	Yoshi2	if you avoid any file starting with "cave" or "new", there is a pretty good chance you can play that file
2014-09-30 21:08:41	@Espyo	right
2014-09-30 21:09:01	@Espyo	only two programs really seem to be affected
2014-09-30 21:09:04	@Espyo	HexChat and Launchy
2014-09-30 21:09:09	@Espyo	Launchy has full amnesia
2014-09-30 21:09:12	@Espyo	HexChat...
2014-09-30 21:09:19	@Espyo	it just failed to fetch the logs from yesterday
2014-09-30 21:09:23	@Espyo	that's all
2014-09-30 21:09:29	@Espyo	everything else about HexChat is just as it should
2014-09-30 21:09:41	Yoshi2	battle_t, book, 2pbattle, comp_results, hiscore, id_test, n_tutorial_1stday and a couple other files play fairly well and are more entertaining than these ff_ sounds ;)
2014-09-30 21:09:42	@Espyo	which only makes me more confused about what the hell's going on
2014-09-30 21:09:50	@Espyo	hey, I have to try book
2014-09-30 21:10:01	@Espyo	there is a stream audio song called book, and it goes unused
2014-09-30 21:10:27	Yoshi2	really?
2014-09-30 21:11:22	@Espyo	wait...
2014-09-30 21:11:28	@Espyo	this sounds like the Piklopedia
2014-09-30 21:11:35	Yoshi2	that's what I thought too
2014-09-30 21:11:44	@Espyo	well, the sequenced one is Piklopedia
2014-09-30 21:11:47	@Espyo	but the stream one is unused
2014-09-30 21:11:56	Yoshi2	mhm, odd
2014-09-30 21:12:33	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2014-09-30 21:24:08	Yoshi2	hm, there should be some information outside of the files about which tracks to play
2014-09-30 21:30:50	@Espyo	yeah, there has to be
2014-09-30 21:31:16	@Espyo	all right, I'm going for a system restore
2014-09-30 21:32:29	Yoshi2	some of the tracks that don't play don't have any normal 0xC1 events at all, which is odd
2014-09-30 21:32:40	Yoshi2	good luck with your system restore

2014-09-30 22:14:08	Yoshi2	that Testyo person seems to be very friendly
2014-09-30 22:14:09	Testyo	I guess the sprays are only meant to be enhancers
2014-09-30 22:14:52	Yoshi2	does Testyo always say something when you mention the name?
2014-09-30 22:14:53	Testyo	or just edit the template so that it automatically cats pages with no icon
2014-09-30 22:15:02	Yoshi2	that seems like it
2014-09-30 22:15:15	@Espyo	thanks
2014-09-30 22:15:19	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-30 22:15:34	@Espyo	he has tools, but saying random stuff when you mention his name is one of his features
2014-09-30 22:15:45	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-09-30 22:15:47	@Espyo	meanwhile, I'm still not sure if a system restore helped
2014-09-30 22:15:53	@Espyo	Launchy is working as it should...
2014-09-30 22:15:57	@Espyo	except it forgot my preferences
2014-09-30 22:16:08	@Espyo	in short: Launchy is a launcher program; if you type H, you get HexChat
2014-09-30 22:16:11	@Espyo	you just press enter, and boom
2014-09-30 22:16:23	@Espyo	but I have several programs with H in the name, so it could give me any one
2014-09-30 22:16:28	@Espyo	but the more I use one, the higher on the list it is
2014-09-30 22:16:34	@Espyo	and for some reason it forgot the list
2014-09-30 22:17:27	@Espyo	and this is I love past me sometimes
2014-09-30 22:17:29	@Espyo	I KNEW this would happen
2014-09-30 22:17:32	@Espyo	so I saved a backup
2014-09-30 22:18:34	@Espyo	a backup of the database that contains the program preferences
2014-09-30 22:18:41	@Espyo	(for Launchy)
2014-09-30 22:18:44	@Espyo	anyway, enough about me
2014-09-30 22:18:57	@Espyo	sorry we had to meet in chat while windows was in the middle of having a brain stroke
2014-09-30 22:19:51	Yoshi2	no problem
2014-09-30 22:21:46	Yoshi2	I find it really odd how different the file structure of Pikmin 1 is compared to Pikmin 2
2014-09-30 22:21:57	Yoshi2	it feels more chaotic
2014-09-30 22:22:03	@Espyo	it is, quite a lot
2014-09-30 22:22:17	@Espyo	the Pikmin 2 files are filled with endless mysteries, it's unbelievable
2014-09-30 22:22:35	@Espyo	like, I wanted to document how many enemies, plants, etc. you can find on each cave sublevel
2014-09-30 22:22:43	@Espyo	and there are still parts of the text files I have no idea about
2014-09-30 22:22:47	@Espyo	the comments don't help
2014-09-30 22:22:57	Yoshi2	the comments are in japanese, I guess?
2014-09-30 22:23:37	@Espyo	they are, but that's not why they're not helpful
2014-09-30 22:23:46	@Espyo	we can run most of them through Google Translate and it's good to go
2014-09-30 22:23:53	@Espyo	it's just that it's such a mess, they don't even help
2014-09-30 22:26:00	@J	last time I used Launchy it felt quite sluggish
2014-09-30 22:26:23	@J	no more sluggish than anything else on Windows, I guess
2014-09-30 22:26:31	@J	but still
2014-09-30 22:26:39	@Espyo	could've been because of a cold boot
2014-09-30 22:26:47	@Espyo	or maybe you indexed your entire PC like a lunatic
2014-09-30 22:26:50	@J	no, I used it for a few weeks
2014-09-30 22:26:53	@Espyo	never had reasons to complain with Launchy
2014-09-30 22:26:57	@J	just the basic interface
2014-09-30 22:27:02	@Espyo	and past Espyo, forget all the mean things I said to you about the Randomness page
2014-09-30 22:27:06	@Espyo	this backup totally makes up for it
2014-09-30 22:27:09	@Espyo	wait, he can't even hear me
2014-09-30 22:27:14	@Espyo	hmm, weird, then
2014-09-30 22:27:17	@Espyo	oh, wait, I think I know what you mean
2014-09-30 22:27:24	@J	takes a little time to show up, and to start filtering actions
2014-09-30 22:27:27	@Espyo	on some machines, the fade-in and fade-out is actually painfully slow
2014-09-30 22:27:39	@Espyo	you can decrease or remove the delays, though
2014-09-30 22:27:54	@J	it was quite a while ago, though, so it may have improved
2014-09-30 22:28:17	@J	the types of actions seemed quite small too, though I never searched for plugins
2014-09-30 22:28:31	@Espyo	Launchy hasn't been updated in over 2 years, though
2014-09-30 22:28:38	@Espyo	some built-in plugins help
2014-09-30 22:28:44	@Espyo	basically, you just want it to launch stuff, really
2014-09-30 22:28:58	@Espyo	but I also use it to open the folder the shortcut or program is on, for instance
2014-09-30 22:29:02	@Espyo	a built-in plugin does it
2014-09-30 22:29:18	@J	okay
2014-09-30 22:29:19	@Espyo	also if I need to search on the Allegro documentation, I just do "A", press tab, and I can type my search term
2014-09-30 22:29:24	@Espyo	or any other page, really
2014-09-30 22:29:29	@Espyo	also Calcy, I love Calcy
2014-09-30 22:29:41	@Espyo	forget opening calculator, just type everything on Launchy and press Enter to copy the answer to the clipboard
2014-09-30 22:29:42	@Espyo	it's perfect
2014-09-30 22:29:46	@J	so other launchers index things like bookmarks, or VMs, or open windows
2014-09-30 22:31:12	@J	http://i.imgur.com/JqMlr5g.png
2014-09-30 22:33:13	@Espyo	index VMs?
2014-09-30 22:33:16	@Espyo	virtual machines?
2014-09-30 22:33:18	@Espyo	how does that...
2014-09-30 22:33:28	@Espyo	open windows is nice, but I personally don't need it
2014-09-30 22:33:36	@Espyo	Launchy has a built-in feature for bookmarks too
2014-09-30 22:33:47	@Espyo	probably updated on some browsers, but works fine with Firefox 3+
2014-09-30 22:33:50	@J	it's just launching the VM in VirtualBox or something
2014-09-30 22:34:13	@Espyo	well, that's not very awesome
2014-09-30 22:34:32	@Espyo	but you can probably hack a way around to doing that with almost any launcher
2014-09-30 22:34:46	@Espyo	anything that can launch bat files; provided VB accepts the VM name as a run parameter
2014-09-30 22:34:54	@Espyo	err, *command line parameter
2014-09-30 22:34:59	@J	but it indexes the existing VM names
2014-09-30 22:35:17	@Espyo	yeah

2014-09-30 22:35:58	Yoshi2	in Pikmin 2 the developer seem to have done a better cleaning up unused items than in Pikmin 1
2014-09-30 22:36:26	Yoshi2	considering that an PC build of Pikmin 1 was found o.o
2014-09-30 22:36:41	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2014-09-30 22:36:48	@Espyo	but that's just in theory
2014-09-30 22:36:57	@Espyo	in practice, Pikmin 2 has like 4 times more unused content than Pikmin 1
2014-09-30 22:37:03	@Espyo	it's more like P1 has a lot of debugging material
2014-09-30 22:37:08	@Espyo	and P2 has a lot of old junk
2014-09-30 22:39:20	@Espyo	the drumkit instrument for BMS is probably gonna be a pain, in MIDI playback
2014-09-30 22:40:39	Yoshi2	everything about BMS will be a pain
2014-09-30 22:41:26	Yoshi2	the old versions of many models in Pikmin 2 are definitely cool (especially the tank turret)
2014-09-30 22:42:07	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-30 22:42:08	Yoshi2	but I have a weak spot for debug content, test levels, unused levels
2014-09-30 22:42:31	@Espyo	hehe, same
2014-09-30 22:42:43	@Espyo	I just like anything that's left behind

2014-09-30 22:53:55	Yoshi2	hm, the trackMap files do look interesting, maybe they contain the key for playing the files correctly
2014-09-30 22:54:16	@Espyo	maybe
2014-09-30 22:54:25	@Espyo	you're more into the music files than I am, so maybe you can find more use for them
2014-09-30 22:54:34	@Espyo	to me, they just look like they map what instruments should be toggled on what events
2014-09-30 22:54:43	@Espyo	like the carrying variation, battle variation, etc.
2014-09-30 22:54:50	Yoshi2	very possible
2014-09-30 22:54:59	Yoshi2	instruments, or trakcs
2014-09-30 22:55:02	Yoshi2	*tracks
2014-09-30 22:55:21	Yoshi2	more likely that specific tracks are turned off
2014-09-30 22:57:20	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-09-30 23:00:08	Yoshi2	on the next occasion I will definitely ask arookas about the .aaf and .asn files
2014-09-30 23:02:33	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-30 23:03:43	Yoshi2	I would do that now, but I'm already waiting for an answer to my previous set of questions concerning where the BPM and PPQN values are and if converting BMS to midi would require a lot of workarounds
2014-09-30 23:04:19	@Espyo	yeah
2014-09-30 23:04:32	Yoshi2	well, technically I am already converting BMS to midi on the fly
2014-09-30 23:05:40	Yoshi2	but there are some events which might require some work, e.g. the ones for jumping from one spot in the track to another
2014-09-30 23:07:20	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-30 23:11:59	Yoshi2	when I first started reading about BMS, I was suprised about the Nintendo GC games using midi-like music files
2014-09-30 23:13:02	Yoshi2	you'd think they could afford to just put the music in a stream format on the disc, but it looks like BMS can do a few things which couldn't be done so well otherwise
2014-09-30 23:13:19	Yoshi2	the limited ram of the console probably had a hand in that too

2014-09-30 23:14:14	Yoshi2	good day
2014-09-30 23:14:25	@PikFan	don't think I've seen you before
2014-09-30 23:14:30	@PikFan	you new?
2014-09-30 23:14:45	Yoshi2	yup
2014-09-30 23:14:50	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-09-30 23:14:55	@PikFan	I'm PikFan
2014-09-30 23:15:05	@PikFan	on the wiki my username is PikFan23
2014-09-30 23:15:22	@PikFan	you'll probably see me making edits here and there
2014-09-30 23:15:44	Yoshi2	ah, nice to meet you
2014-09-30 23:15:49	@PikFan	likewise
2014-09-30 23:18:44	Yoshi2	I do not have an account on the pikmin wiki at the moment, but I'm working on parsing and playing Pikmin 2's BMS music sequence files
2014-09-30 23:19:38	@PikFan	oh, you're the user Espyo was talking about
2014-09-30 23:19:52	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-09-30 23:20:06	@PikFan	he mentioned somebody was looking into P2's music files
2014-09-30 23:20:48	@Espyo	hi
2014-09-30 23:20:52	@PikFan	hi
2014-09-30 23:20:56	@PikFan	at school still
2014-09-30 23:20:58	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> when I first started reading about BMS, I was suprised about the Nintendo GC games using midi-like music files
2014-09-30 23:21:11	@Espyo	yeah, I would've imagined something completely crazy, too
2014-09-30 23:21:14	@PikFan	>suprised
2014-09-30 23:21:36	@PikFan	(sorry, bit of a grammar nazi)
2014-09-30 23:21:36	@Espyo	that happens too often
2014-09-30 23:21:42	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> you'd think they could afford to just put the music in a stream format on the disc, but it looks like BMS can do a few things which couldn't be done so well otherwise
2014-09-30 23:21:46	@Espyo	I don't think any machine could
2014-09-30 23:21:52	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 songs have like 500 variations in total
2014-09-30 23:21:57	@PikFan	what is BMS anyway?
2014-09-30 23:22:12	@Espyo	well, more like 9 variations, that end up with 512 combos
2014-09-30 23:22:13	@PikFan	something... music sequence?
2014-09-30 23:22:27	Yoshi2	binary music sequence maybe
2014-09-30 23:22:36	@Espyo	mhm
2014-09-30 23:23:28	@PikFan	so we're learning how to do spreadsheets in Excel
2014-09-30 23:23:34	@PikFan	it's alright
2014-09-30 23:23:46	@PikFan	and we're learning to touch type
2014-09-30 23:24:04	@PikFan	which yeah, I get is important, but I prefer using two fingers
2014-09-30 23:24:07	@PikFan	because sameness
2014-09-30 23:24:13	@Espyo	hehe
2014-09-30 23:24:19	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-09-30 23:24:20	Yoshi2	in computer science, we once had to create game of life in Excel
2014-09-30 23:24:25	@Espyo	oh wow, that's amazing
2014-09-30 23:24:28	@PikFan	interesting
2014-09-30 23:24:37	Yoshi2	it was fun in a way, but
2014-09-30 23:24:38	Yoshi2	Excel
2014-09-30 23:24:40	Yoshi2	seriously
2014-09-30 23:24:55	@Espyo	hehe, yep
2014-09-30 23:25:14	@PikFan	how would you do that though
2014-09-30 23:25:19	@PikFan	it seems difficult
2014-09-30 23:25:30	Yoshi2	not too difficult
2014-09-30 23:25:51	@PikFan	not too difficult how?
2014-09-30 23:26:10	@Espyo	Excel has scripts
2014-09-30 23:26:20	@Espyo	I mean, you did use visual basic for it, right?
2014-09-30 23:26:27	Yoshi2	I don't think so
2014-09-30 23:26:37	Yoshi2	I think we actually put the stuff into the cells
2014-09-30 23:26:44	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-09-30 23:27:03	Yoshi2	there were several groups of cells, each representing a specific point in time
2014-09-30 23:27:07	@PikFan	hey Espyo, I gotta go home
2014-09-30 23:27:15	@PikFan	do you think you'll be on when I get home
2014-09-30 23:27:17	@PikFan	*+?
2014-09-30 23:27:25	@Espyo	doubt it
2014-09-30 23:27:29	@Espyo	 30 minutes = bed

2014-09-30 23:27:45	Yoshi2	stupid time zones
2014-09-30 23:27:46	@Espyo	let me just say right now
2014-09-30 23:27:47	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-09-30 23:27:53	@Espyo	we NEED to advertise the move, asap
2014-09-30 23:28:03	@Espyo	if Smash 4 is released, we can might as well forget the spread
2014-09-30 23:28:08	@PikFan	yeah, but what's with the--oh
2014-09-30 23:28:10	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> stupid time zones
2014-09-30 23:28:11	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-09-30 23:28:27	@Espyo	if Smash 4 is released before we spread the word, our posts will be drowned, in whatever social media place we pick
2014-09-30 23:28:34	@PikFan	yeah, when Smash 4 is released, it'll be Pikmin 3 all over agained
2014-09-30 23:28:37	@PikFan	*again
2014-09-30 23:28:39	@PikFan	wow
2014-09-30 23:28:43	@PikFan	anyway, bye
2014-09-30 23:28:45	@Espyo	plus people who want to know more about Pikmin will instantly search Pikmin Wiki before being told otherwise

2014-09-30 23:51:23	Yoshi2	as far as I can tell, they are not very helpful for actually playing the BMS files

2014-10-01 11:33:47	Yoshi2	Espyo: according to microsoft, this error happened due to a memory access violation
2014-10-01 11:33:54	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-01 11:33:57	@Espyo	could mean anything, really
2014-10-01 11:34:01	Yoshi2	yup
2014-10-01 11:34:07	Yoshi2	I hope it doesn't happen again
2014-10-01 11:34:15	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 11:34:29	Yoshi2	probably just some program that messed up and accessed the wrong memory
2014-10-01 11:34:42	@Espyo	hm, my work laptop used to blue screen whenever I left it locked and idle, so that it entered suspend mode
2014-10-01 11:34:48	@Espyo	so I just disabled suspend mode altogether
2014-10-01 11:34:54	@Espyo	yeah, hopefully
2014-10-01 11:35:30	Yoshi2	a few weeks ago the bluescreens happened very regulary
2014-10-01 11:35:44	@Espyo	boy, that doesn't sound good at all
2014-10-01 11:35:50	Yoshi2	but then somebody told me that a new windows update caused lots of issues
2014-10-01 11:36:06	Yoshi2	so I uninstalled that update, and everything was fine ever since
2014-10-01 11:36:11	@Espyo	oh yeah, that one
2014-10-01 11:36:19	@Espyo	I remember disabling it too, just in case
2014-10-01 11:36:25	@Espyo	though I don't remember ever having a bsod because of it
2014-10-01 11:37:15	Yoshi2	later on, they pushed out a new update which should fix the issues
2014-10-01 11:37:27	Yoshi2	but that one caused bsods on my computer too
2014-10-01 11:37:34	@Espyo	ugh
2014-10-01 11:38:16	Yoshi2	well, it doesn't help that I have windows vista, which will not be receiving any support except in emergency cases
2014-10-01 11:38:29	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-01 11:42:01	Yoshi2	now that I started university, I have the ability to upgrade the OS free of cost
2014-10-01 11:42:16	@Espyo	nice!
2014-10-01 11:42:33	Yoshi2	but the PC has barely any options for upgrades
2014-10-01 11:42:47	@Espyo	hardware upgrades?
2014-10-01 11:43:12	Yoshi2	I could upgrade the ram from 3 GB to 4 GB, I could upgrade the GPU (again), I could add an SSD, and that's about it
2014-10-01 11:43:24	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-01 11:43:33	@Espyo	though most laptops can only really be upgraded with that
2014-10-01 11:43:36	@Espyo	not much else
2014-10-01 11:44:02	Yoshi2	everything else requires me to upgrade the motherboard, which requires me to buy a new CPU
2014-10-01 11:44:08	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 11:44:25	Yoshi2	and I'd rather put that money towards a notebook of sorts
2014-10-01 11:44:37	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-01 11:57:34	Yoshi2	interesting fact: Pikmin 1 has a different way of storing audio than Pikmin 2
2014-10-01 11:57:50	Yoshi2	Pikmin 1's way seems to be similar to Super Mario Sunshine, as far as I can tell
2014-10-01 11:58:05	Yoshi2	a single archive file that stores all the BMS files without a clear structure
2014-10-01 11:58:15	Yoshi2	while Pikmin 2 uses a RARC archive
2014-10-01 11:59:03	@Espyo	hmm, neat
2014-10-01 11:59:30	@Espyo	I just wish there was a better way to remove sounds from Pikmin 2
2014-10-01 11:59:38	@Espyo	because we've been wanting to get a rip of the C-stick whistle sound for ages
2014-10-01 11:59:48	@Espyo	and the birds chirping in the background gets in the way
2014-10-01 12:00:00	@Espyo	we can randomly crop off the sound file, which amazingly, doesn't make Pikmin 2 crash
2014-10-01 12:00:02	@Espyo	but it's all luck
2014-10-01 12:01:01	Yoshi2	moving the C-stick makes birds chirp in the background?
2014-10-01 12:01:10	@Espyo	hehe, that's not what I meant
2014-10-01 12:01:22	@Espyo	in the overworld areas, there are always birds chirping, or ducks quacking
2014-10-01 12:01:27	Yoshi2	ah
2014-10-01 12:01:29	@Espyo	and if you want to record the audio of the C-stick sound
2014-10-01 12:01:31	@Espyo	they get in the way
2014-10-01 12:01:37	@Espyo	caves are quiet... but they have an echo effect
2014-10-01 12:01:38	Yoshi2	oh, I see
2014-10-01 12:01:56	@Espyo	and for some bizarre reason, the test level has snow falling, and a wind sound effect
2014-10-01 12:02:12	Yoshi2	there is a test level?
2014-10-01 12:02:15	@Espyo	Miles did manage to rip the C-stick sound, but only one of them
2014-10-01 12:02:19	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-01 12:02:32	@Espyo	it has loads of objects, ramps, water, the usual
2014-10-01 12:02:37	Yoshi2	oh right
2014-10-01 12:02:40	Yoshi2	I see
2014-10-01 12:02:47	Yoshi2	it has no music, I guess?
2014-10-01 12:03:03	@Espyo	I can't remember, but I think it uses the Valley of Repose's theme
2014-10-01 12:03:21	@Espyo	that could be because to access it, people normally replace the Valley of Repose
2014-10-01 12:03:34	@Espyo	but I could swear one day I used a code that replaced a different area, and it was still the same theme
2014-10-01 12:03:45	@Espyo	and the same snow effect/wind noise
2014-10-01 12:03:55	Yoshi2	mhm
2014-10-01 12:04:17	Yoshi2	there is an id_test.bms file which sounds as if lots of random instruments are being played
2014-10-01 12:04:30	@Espyo	oh?
2014-10-01 12:04:33	@Espyo	gotta hear that one
2014-10-01 12:04:48	Yoshi2	I do not know if that is used in the game
2014-10-01 12:05:13	@Espyo	don't really recall any song that would use several instruments
2014-10-01 12:05:18	@Espyo	plus the name...
2014-10-01 12:09:57	Yoshi2	it sounds very crazy, has 0xC different tracks playing
2014-10-01 12:10:09	Yoshi2	12 tracks
2014-10-01 12:12:22	@Espyo	woah
2014-10-01 12:12:56	@Espyo	hey, come to think of it, the test stage is actually called newtest
2014-10-01 12:13:07	@Espyo	so maybe they had an old test stage, and it used that crazy theme
2014-10-01 12:19:44	Yoshi2	that might be possible
2014-10-01 12:20:46	Yoshi2	I am also very curious about these new_X files
2014-10-01 12:21:21	@Espyo	IIRC, they're mostly cave music
2014-10-01 12:21:59	Yoshi2	they are often referred to in the same places as the cave music, that's true
2014-10-01 12:28:37	Yoshi2	looking at the files, it almost feels as if there should be an easy way to get into the test map using a cheat code
2014-10-01 12:30:46	@Espyo	there are some codes
2014-10-01 12:32:04	@Espyo	oh, TCRF doesn't say
2014-10-01 12:32:06	@Espyo	but I know there are codes
2014-10-01 12:32:11	@Espyo	they should come bundled with Dolphin
2014-10-01 12:33:10	Yoshi2	hm, my pal version does not come with codes
2014-10-01 12:33:55	@Espyo	how weird
2014-10-01 12:33:57	@Espyo	what version of Dolphin?
2014-10-01 12:34:04	Yoshi2	4.0
2014-10-01 12:34:44	@Espyo	it should...
2014-10-01 12:35:01	@Espyo	hm, hang on
2014-10-01 12:35:18	@Espyo	I mean, the codes should come anyway, but I'm not 100% sure if the test level codes are there
2014-10-01 12:35:21	@Espyo	but I know where to get them
2014-10-01 12:36:01	Yoshi2	the NTSC version has codes
2014-10-01 12:36:54	Yoshi2	sadly, NTSC codes are not easy to convert into PAL
2014-10-01 12:39:19	@Espyo	indeed they aren't...
2014-10-01 12:39:59	@Espyo	http://www.gc-forever.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=2154
2014-10-01 12:40:03	@Espyo	the test level code should be there
2014-10-01 12:40:10	@Espyo	some of these codes aren't anywhere else, which is pretty neat
2014-10-01 12:42:18	Yoshi2	I really wonder how people create so many different codes
2014-10-01 12:43:38	Yoshi2	I know enough to modify things such as health and money, but some things require a lot more knowledge about the game code
2014-10-01 12:44:07	@Espyo	hehe, same
2014-10-01 12:44:21	@Espyo	some codes look more like they change behavior, not RAM
2014-10-01 12:44:27	@Espyo	which really makes me wonder exactly what codes do
2014-10-01 12:44:35	@Espyo	I mean, I guess pointers to functions and whatnot are in RAM
2014-10-01 12:44:44	@Espyo	but to do what some codes do, they'd have to be like 3000 lines long
2014-10-01 12:44:50	@Espyo	and they aren't
2014-10-01 12:45:08	Yoshi2	the program code is likely inside the ram
2014-10-01 12:46:27	@Espyo	yes, but probably in assembly
2014-10-01 12:46:40	@Espyo	so loads of machine instructions just to get the game to point to which map to load
2014-10-01 12:48:31	Yoshi2	when I try to replace some files, 9 times out of 10 the game will crash or freeze in some way
2014-10-01 12:48:58	@Espyo	mhm, same here
2014-10-01 12:49:15	@Espyo	which just makes me wonder harder how in the world it's possible to mess with the sound effects file, crop it, and the game won't care
2014-10-01 12:49:28	@Espyo	it throws a fit if some files aren't the exact same size as originally
2014-10-01 12:50:34	Yoshi2	yup
2014-10-01 12:51:09	Yoshi2	well, thankfully the game does not use checksums
2014-10-01 12:51:24	Yoshi2	fighting against those would be a huge pain
2014-10-01 12:52:07	@Espyo	mhm!
2014-10-01 12:53:06	Yoshi2	I
2014-10-01 12:53:08	Yoshi2	what
2014-10-01 12:53:54	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-10-01 12:54:02	Yoshi2	looks like stages.txt does have a huge effect on the game
2014-10-01 12:54:10	@Espyo	where's that, again?
2014-10-01 12:54:25	Yoshi2	in /user/Abe
2014-10-01 12:54:53	@Espyo	oh
2014-10-01 12:54:53	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-01 12:54:57	@Espyo	they might be hard-coded
2014-10-01 12:55:06	@Espyo	I mean, I doubt the list of areas would be flexible
2014-10-01 12:55:15	@Espyo	the characters have to refer to other areas in cutscenes
2014-10-01 12:55:18	@Espyo	some items unlock new areas
2014-10-01 12:55:28	@Espyo	the area selection screen is built exactly with those areas in mind
2014-10-01 12:55:29	@Espyo	etc.
2014-10-01 12:56:26	@Espyo	btw, this is all I know about what game files are what http://tcrf.net/Notes:Pikmin_2#ISO_map
2014-10-01 12:58:53	Yoshi2	ohh, that is a lot of information
2014-10-01 12:59:15	Yoshi2	you managed to play the wScene files?
2014-10-01 12:59:32	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-01 12:59:38	@Espyo	it's all there in the page, too
2014-10-01 13:00:04	Yoshi2	I am very interested in that.
2014-10-01 13:01:02	Yoshi2	instruments are very useful for correctly playing the BMS files
2014-10-01 13:01:43	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 13:01:59	@Espyo	I can't tell for sure, but each of the non _0 ones looks like it belongs to a theme
2014-10-01 13:02:09	@Espyo	oh, I pointed that out too
2014-10-01 13:02:11	@Espyo	it's at the bottom
2014-10-01 13:02:54	Yoshi2	awesome! The guy who made the wwdumpsnd program even included the source code
2014-10-01 13:03:00	Yoshi2	that is the way it should be
2014-10-01 13:03:29	@Espyo	hehehe, yeah
2014-10-01 13:03:45	@Espyo	surprisingly, almost all programs like these actually have the source code
2014-10-01 13:03:47	@Espyo	really nice of the devs
2014-10-01 13:03:58	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-01 13:05:30	Yoshi2	until I receive a response from the SMS guy, I think I can look into how to add custom midi instruments
2014-10-01 13:05:40	Yoshi2	because the standard windows instruments do not fit at all
2014-10-01 13:06:43	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 13:06:46	@Espyo	I recommend
2014-10-01 13:06:47	@Espyo	uh...
2014-10-01 13:06:49	@Espyo	what's it called again
2014-10-01 13:06:51	@Espyo	Chaos
2014-10-01 13:07:08	@Espyo	I just don't know how to replace windows' soundfont with another one
2014-10-01 13:07:13	@Espyo	either Chaos or Fluid
2014-10-01 13:07:21	Yoshi2	hmmm
2014-10-01 13:07:22	@Espyo	unless you mean replace with a soundfont that sounds like Pikmin 2
2014-10-01 13:07:27	@Espyo	in that case, it'll probably take months to make one
2014-10-01 13:07:40	@Espyo	watch out, though
2014-10-01 13:07:44	@Espyo	both Chaos and Fluid are over 50 MB
2014-10-01 13:08:00	Yoshi2	ehm
2014-10-01 13:08:46	Yoshi2	PCs nowadays often have 1 TB of space
2014-10-01 13:08:52	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2014-10-01 13:08:54	Yoshi2	so 50 MB will be a drop in the bucket
2014-10-01 13:09:08	@Espyo	but it's just that if you think you're gonna download a soundfont and get it done in a second
2014-10-01 13:09:11	@Espyo	it might take a while to download
2014-10-01 13:09:18	@Espyo	specially from the place you choose to download it from
2014-10-01 13:09:21	@Espyo	either way, brb, lunch
2014-10-01 13:09:38	Yoshi2	well, I think I am patient enough for that
2014-10-01 13:44:21	@Espyo	yeah, it's not THAT big
2014-10-01 13:44:29	@Espyo	but it really caught me off-guard when I first downloaded it

2014-10-01 15:53:11	Yoshi2	thanks
2014-10-01 15:53:12	@Espyo	the chat isn't usually very active lately, because most of the Pikmin Wiki users just use Skype
2014-10-01 15:53:20	@Espyo	but either way, J's at work, so he can't really talk
2014-10-01 15:53:32	@Espyo	I'm at work too, but they're not as picky here, so I can just use IRC freely
2014-10-01 15:54:51	Yoshi2	I see
2014-10-01 15:55:15	Yoshi2	how do they use skype? Is there some sort of skype convo with all of the people?
2014-10-01 15:56:17	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-01 15:56:23	@Espyo	they've had it since before we merged
2014-10-01 15:56:31	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-10-01 15:56:58	@Espyo	it's convenient, but not as much as IRC
2014-10-01 15:57:02	@Espyo	sometimes they use it for voice chat
2014-10-01 15:57:03	Yoshi2	yeah
2014-10-01 15:57:08	@Espyo	I tried it once, so far, and man oh man
2014-10-01 15:57:13	@Espyo	it sounds just as messy as you think
2014-10-01 15:57:36	Yoshi2	google+'s hangouts are quite good
2014-10-01 15:58:11	Yoshi2	I don't like skype very much, can't get myself to install it since I reinstalled windows
2014-10-01 15:58:28	@Espyo	meh, skype works minimally well for me
2014-10-01 15:58:31	@Espyo	enough for me to not complain
2014-10-01 15:58:35	@Espyo	but I certainly don't glorify it
2014-10-01 15:58:45	@Espyo	I like google things, but I was never a fan of google+ whatsoever
2014-10-01 15:58:53	Yoshi2	me neither
2014-10-01 15:58:54	@Espyo	likely because of the way they just brought it out
2014-10-01 15:58:57	@Espyo	and forced it, ugh
2014-10-01 15:59:19	Yoshi2	after a long long time of pestering me about putting in my real name, they allowed me to just use my nickname

2014-10-01 16:04:00	@Espyo	though I'm used to it

2014-10-01 16:06:47	--	Yoshi2_ is now known as Yoshi2
2014-10-01 16:06:48	@Espyo	naturally, I only really get like... I never checked, but around 40
2014-10-01 16:06:51	@Espyo	which is good enough for me
2014-10-01 16:06:57	@Espyo	but sometimes, it just... gah
2014-10-01 16:07:07	Yoshi2	mhm, that is very annoying
2014-10-01 16:07:16	Yoshi2	they advertise it as "Up to 100 MBit/s"
2014-10-01 16:07:21	Yoshi2	so they are technically not wrong
2014-10-01 16:23:33	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-01 16:23:45	@Espyo	no, but because I'm connected to my wireless router, naturally, not all of it will get through
2014-10-01 16:28:07	Yoshi2	that is true, wireless routers usually have to account for interference, so the speed will be lower
2014-10-01 16:29:03	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 16:30:23	Yoshi2	I do have quite some interest to make a soundfont out of Pikmin 2's instruments
2014-10-01 16:35:14	@Espyo	it'll probably be hard
2014-10-01 16:35:21	@Espyo	I think Vienna is the tool for the job
2014-10-01 16:36:37	Yoshi2	I found Viena
2014-10-01 16:42:40	Yoshi2	I really wonder what the difference is between Samples, Instruments and Presets
2014-10-01 16:45:09	Yoshi2	I see
2014-10-01 16:45:18	Yoshi2	samples are the audio files I just dumped
2014-10-01 16:45:34	Yoshi2	instruments is taking that sample and turning it into an instrument
2014-10-01 16:48:05	Yoshi2	hrm
2014-10-01 16:48:11	Yoshi2	those are a lot of samples
2014-10-01 16:49:08	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-01 16:49:17	@Espyo	there's like over a thousand, it's ridiculous
2014-10-01 16:49:27	@Espyo	though actual instruments, they're probably 100 or less
2014-10-01 16:49:33	@Espyo	I think there are a lot of duplicates, too
2014-10-01 16:50:00	Yoshi2	I assume the number in wScene_X refers to the instrument bank
2014-10-01 16:50:11	Yoshi2	so there are ~40 instrument banks
2014-10-01 16:51:33	Yoshi2	48
2014-10-01 16:51:42	Yoshi2	seriously, no
2014-10-01 16:51:47	Yoshi2	I am not going to do this by hand
2014-10-01 16:51:55	@Espyo	you really can't
2014-10-01 16:51:55	Yoshi2	there has to be an automated way to do this
2014-10-01 16:51:57	@Espyo	it'd take years
2014-10-01 16:52:26	Yoshi2	it wouldn't, but it is tedious, basically unskilled work
2014-10-01 16:52:35	Yoshi2	because you just have to add the samples
2014-10-01 16:52:39	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-01 16:52:40	Yoshi2	then add each sample as an instrument
2014-10-01 16:52:52	Yoshi2	hopefully there is some way to automate that
2014-10-01 16:53:31	Yoshi2	otherwise, I'll just do one instrument bank
2014-10-01 16:53:39	@Espyo	I'm not really seeing any way, though
2014-10-01 16:53:49	@Espyo	also, almost all instruments have 4/5 samples for different tones
2014-10-01 16:54:05	@Espyo	it'll be hell realizing what each one represents
2014-10-01 16:54:14	@Espyo	I'd guess oTuner would help
2014-10-01 16:54:45	Yoshi2	my guess is that the audio system in the game is primitive
2014-10-01 16:55:00	Yoshi2	and each tone just represents an instrument 
2014-10-01 16:55:00	@Espyo	if so, they managed to pull off an impressive lot with it
2014-10-01 16:55:23	Yoshi2	in the BMS file they can choose instrument banks and instrument programs
2014-10-01 16:55:41	Yoshi2	for each, they have up to 127 choices
2014-10-01 16:56:49	Yoshi2	it is definitely impressive
2014-10-01 16:57:03	Yoshi2	and I am really looking forward to playing the more complicated music pieces
2014-10-01 16:57:16	Yoshi2	I really like the music in the forest
2014-10-01 16:57:25	@Espyo	much like MIDI, then
2014-10-01 16:57:35	@Espyo	the Awakening Wood, yeah, it's pretty nice
2014-10-01 16:57:44	@Espyo	all of the music in the game is pretty darn awesome
2014-10-01 16:57:53	@Espyo	except the caves, which are meant to be wonky
2014-10-01 16:57:58	Yoshi2	it is VERY much like midi
2014-10-01 16:58:00	@Espyo	and even then they're still pretty catchy sometimes
2014-10-01 16:58:10	@Espyo	it makes me wish I hadn't given up!
2014-10-01 16:58:25	@Espyo	but after a bit of feeling around blindly, I just had to give up
2014-10-01 16:58:33	Yoshi2	is it that bad?
2014-10-01 16:58:49	Yoshi2	I found the first two caves odd, but they weren't too bad
2014-10-01 16:58:55	@Espyo	oh, I don't mean the cave songs
2014-10-01 16:59:03	@Espyo	I meant me trying a hand at reverse engineering the format
2014-10-01 16:59:14	Yoshi2	ohh, I see
2014-10-01 16:59:14	@Espyo	it's close to MIDI, but at the time I didn't know, I was completely blind
2014-10-01 16:59:16	@Espyo	and gave up quickly
2014-10-01 16:59:25	@Espyo	but the cave songs are pretty much meant to sound weird
2014-10-01 16:59:27	@Espyo	not bad, but weird
2014-10-01 16:59:33	@Espyo	and some are pretty enjoyable
2014-10-01 16:59:39	@Espyo	it seems to depend a bit on the type of cave
2014-10-01 16:59:47	@Espyo	easy caves have pretty quiet and calm themes
2014-10-01 16:59:54	@Espyo	other caves are more upbeat or imperial-like
2014-10-01 17:18:52	Yoshi2	hm, I might have found a different soundfont editor with a feature for processing lots of data automatically
2014-10-01 17:18:59	Yoshi2	or at least that's what Polyphone is promising
2014-10-01 17:21:06	@Espyo	oh, nice
2014-10-01 17:21:12	@Espyo	hm, sounds like it's paid software, though
2014-10-01 17:29:27	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure it is free
2014-10-01 17:30:00	@Espyo	oh, nice then

2014-10-01 20:06:34	Yoshi2	wb Espyo 
2014-10-01 20:06:39	@Espyo	thanks
2014-10-01 20:10:48	Yoshi2	Espyo: I've looked a bit into Polyphene, it does not have those automatic features I hoped for
2014-10-01 20:11:50	Yoshi2	any python implementation of the SF2 format also seems to be more work than it is worth, so I'll just go with Polyphene
2014-10-01 20:12:30	@Espyo	damn
2014-10-01 20:12:33	@Espyo	good luck
2014-10-01 20:14:24	Yoshi2	I'll probably just make one test soundfont
2014-10-01 20:15:15	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-01 20:15:26	Yoshi2	http://quitte.de/file-formats/SF2.py this python implementation seems to be very low level
2014-10-01 20:15:49	@Espyo	yeah, it does
2014-10-01 20:15:55	Yoshi2	if I had more time on my hands, I'd probably do something with that
2014-10-01 20:16:05	Yoshi2	but right now, it just isn't worth it
2014-10-01 20:17:37	@Espyo	of course...
2014-10-01 20:17:42	@Espyo	ugh, lack of time, I know that all too well
2014-10-01 20:17:54	Yoshi2	I still need to convert the BMS file into a midi file so I can actually make use of a custom soundfont

2014-10-01 20:20:43	Yoshi2	basic midi conversion would be easily possible, I think
2014-10-01 20:20:51	@Espyo	yeah, I think they should
2014-10-01 20:21:17	Yoshi2	I just record what notes are being played in which channel at what time
2014-10-01 20:21:29	Yoshi2	that is not a correct conversion, but it works for testing a soundfont

2014-10-01 20:50:43	@Espyo	if a program doesn't crash the first time you code it, something is DEFINITELY wrong
2014-10-01 20:50:48	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-01 20:50:57	Yoshi2	well, the error was very stupid, now it runs
2014-10-01 20:51:21	Yoshi2	but I have no means of stopping it, I need to trigger a keyboard interrupt in the IDE
2014-10-01 20:51:57	@Espyo	hehe
2014-10-01 20:53:18	Yoshi2	looks like I need to launch the program outside of the ide
2014-10-01 20:54:53	Yoshi2	the result is a file that wasn't written correctly, awesome
2014-10-01 20:55:36	@Espyo	that's nuts
2014-10-01 21:03:49	Yoshi2	time to poke the file with a hex editor
2014-10-01 21:04:33	Yoshi2	it did write something
2014-10-01 21:11:51	Yoshi2	ohhhh
2014-10-01 21:11:59	Yoshi2	now I've got something that looks like something
2014-10-01 21:12:33	Yoshi2	but the tempo is far too high
2014-10-01 21:17:39	Yoshi2	ahhh, I see
2014-10-01 21:19:39	Yoshi2	ohhh, this is good
2014-10-01 21:22:19	Yoshi2	well, damn. I broke it D:
2014-10-01 21:24:14	Yoshi2	this breaks my heart, it worked just a bit ago
2014-10-01 21:25:40	Yoshi2	ah, I see
2014-10-01 21:26:22	Yoshi2	I messed up the tempo
2014-10-01 21:26:48	@Espyo	hehe
2014-10-01 21:31:58	Yoshi2	the tempo must now be 1 BPM for the music to play correctly
2014-10-01 21:32:21	Yoshi2	I guess that is because the difference in ticks between each event is so small
2014-10-01 21:37:26	Yoshi2	ehh
2014-10-01 21:38:00	@Espyo	wow

2014-10-01 21:52:16	Yoshi2	I think I am missing something
2014-10-01 21:52:40	Yoshi2	the music player probably tries to play back each note and has no concern for pauses
2014-10-01 21:52:50	Yoshi2	*breaks
2014-10-01 21:56:55	Yoshi2	I will have to rewrite things here, I guess
2014-10-01 22:00:08	@Espyo	woah
2014-10-01 22:00:11	@Espyo	that sucks
2014-10-01 22:00:26	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-01 22:01:00	Yoshi2	the current setup is good for playing music as it is parsed, but it is not good for writing a file that needs to be a sequence
2014-10-01 22:01:57	Yoshi2	I could write some code for keeping track of events, then write the events in a linear fashion into the file
2014-10-01 22:03:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 22:04:11	Yoshi2	which is additional work, I hate additional work
2014-10-01 22:04:30	Yoshi2	but I'm afraid that is the best way to do it
2014-10-01 22:05:46	Yoshi2	the alternative is to change parsing so that it parses one track at a time, but tracks can loop around, so that is not an option
2014-10-01 22:05:48	@Espyo	everybody does
2014-10-01 22:05:55	@Espyo	yeah

2014-10-01 22:29:50	Yoshi2	so far my idea seems to work very well

2014-10-01 22:31:20	@Espyo	hm, good

2014-10-01 22:43:13	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-10-01 22:43:15	@Espyo	I so hope you're right
2014-10-01 22:43:59	Yoshi2	I also had to put the BPM value back to 96, and now it sounds like something
2014-10-01 22:45:56	Yoshi2	strangely, the instruments sound different, I wonder why that is
2014-10-01 22:46:11	@Espyo	hm, that is strange
2014-10-01 22:46:19	@Espyo	maybe pygame has its own soundfont?
2014-10-01 22:47:51	Yoshi2	unlikely
2014-10-01 22:48:11	@Espyo	yeah, sounds unlikely
2014-10-01 22:48:24	Yoshi2	good soundfonts are quite big, as you mentioned
2014-10-01 22:48:46	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-01 22:48:46	Yoshi2	maybe pygame has different instrument banks defined, or I messed up somewhere
2014-10-01 22:49:04	@Espyo	starting with 0/1?
2014-10-01 22:52:37	Yoshi2	I am not sure
2014-10-01 22:52:55	Yoshi2	well, that shouldn't be the problem
2014-10-01 22:53:53	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 22:57:37	Yoshi2	I should probably add a command line interface to this, but it is rather late
2014-10-01 22:58:34	@Espyo	yes, leave it for tomorrow
2014-10-01 22:58:53	Yoshi2	I'll just try the various BMS files

2014-10-01 22:59:46	Yoshi2	oh no, the instruments for worldmap.bms are completely messed up :(

2014-10-01 23:01:40	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-01 23:03:54	Yoshi2	added a way to change the instrument bank
2014-10-01 23:05:40	Yoshi2	hmm, I wonder if it has any effect at all
2014-10-01 23:06:53	Yoshi2	it has no effect at all, odd
2014-10-01 23:07:24	@Espyo	huh, weird
2014-10-01 23:11:36	Yoshi2	odd indeed
2014-10-01 23:11:51	Yoshi2	maybe the media player doesn't handle bank switching

2014-10-01 23:12:47	@Espyo	lowut
2014-10-01 23:12:50	Yoshi2	very odd
2014-10-01 23:13:03	@Espyo	anyway, I know quite a few don't really allow bank switching
2014-10-01 23:13:24	Yoshi2	that might be the reason
2014-10-01 23:18:47	Yoshi2	well, the next step is finding a good program for working with midi files and custom soundfonts, and creating a custom soundfont

2014-10-01 23:23:01	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-01 23:23:15	Yoshi2	well, in case of custom formats it makes sense to wait
2014-10-01 23:23:31	Yoshi2	but meanwhile we can try to get the Pikmin 2 soundfont to work
2014-10-01 23:24:33	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-01 23:49:47	Yoshi2	hmm, I'll need to see how to handle this additional dependency
2014-10-01 23:51:51	@Espyo	oh boy
2014-10-01 23:52:49	Yoshi2	it cannot be pip'd, so installation is a bit more difficult
2014-10-01 23:53:28	Yoshi2	but according to the author, it is licensed under GPL which afaik is not compatible with my current license, so I can't just throw it onto github
2014-10-01 23:54:59	Yoshi2	but technically, the author has not included an actual license file with the code
2014-10-01 23:55:24	@Espyo	drat
2014-10-01 23:55:27	Yoshi2	I think I will look for an alternative midi library that is properly licensed

2014-10-02 10:28:48	Yoshi2	good morning
2014-10-02 10:29:07	@Espyo	morning
2014-10-02 10:32:34	Yoshi2	I'd be interested in trying some SMS music files, but I am not sure how to parse the archive file from the game
2014-10-02 10:33:31	@Espyo	hm, I don't know what types of files it uses
2014-10-02 10:33:36	@Espyo	but it should be easier to open than Pikmin 2's
2014-10-02 10:33:45	@Espyo	for one thing, more documentation and tools exist for SMS
2014-10-02 10:35:11	Yoshi2	well, Pikmin 2 uses RARC for storing the BMS files
2014-10-02 10:35:34	Yoshi2	so that is not a problem
2014-10-02 10:37:12	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-02 10:37:21	@Espyo	but it still feels like there are less tools for P2
2014-10-02 10:38:40	Yoshi2	the game still uses BMD for 3D models
2014-10-02 10:39:00	Yoshi2	but there is a whole lot of other data that is stored in unknown formats, I agree
2014-10-02 10:40:06	@Espyo	specially animations
2014-10-02 10:40:13	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 is so weird with animation files
2014-10-02 10:40:21	@Espyo	in that all of them use a format nobody really knows yet
2014-10-02 10:40:27	@Espyo	...EXCEPT for the treasure carrying animations
2014-10-02 10:40:34	@Espyo	which use animation files BMDView2 can play
2014-10-02 10:40:43	@Espyo	I really, REALLY wanted to see the other animations :(
2014-10-02 10:40:52	@Espyo	maybe I can replace them in-game, hmm...
2014-10-02 10:41:03	@Espyo	I only recently learn how to re-pack .rarc and .szs files
2014-10-02 10:49:55	Yoshi2	I am looking at the talk page for SMS's TCRF page to see if anybody wrote down the format of the sound archive
2014-10-02 10:50:03	Yoshi2	so far, no dice :(
2014-10-02 10:52:03	@Espyo	drat
2014-10-02 11:00:31	Yoshi2	it is really interesting how many similarities there are between the Gamecube games
2014-10-02 11:01:01	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-02 11:01:02	Yoshi2	it's as if Nintendo has some sort of "Super Game Engine" which is used by each of their games in some variation
2014-10-02 11:01:07	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2014-10-02 11:02:46	Yoshi2	time to figure out the format of SMS's sound archive, I guess
2014-10-02 11:03:00	Yoshi2	or maybe the SMS guy has written a reply
2014-10-02 11:03:31	Yoshi2	nope
2014-10-02 11:04:45	@Espyo	slow :/
2014-10-02 11:05:44	Yoshi2	well, it isn't too bad
2014-10-02 11:06:08	Yoshi2	I wrote the email on the 29th of last month, so it has only been 3 days or so
2014-10-02 11:06:20	Yoshi2	still, 3 days is too much to just sit around and do nothing
2014-10-02 11:06:45	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-02 11:08:02	Yoshi2	I wouldn't be in a hurry normally, but I want to squeece in as much work as possible because I don't know how my productivity will be when university starts next week
2014-10-02 11:10:26	@Espyo	of course...
2014-10-02 11:10:36	@Espyo	chances are it'll be low
2014-10-02 11:10:40	@Espyo	wait, it only starts next week?
2014-10-02 11:11:02	Yoshi2	yep
2014-10-02 11:11:14	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-10-02 11:11:19	@Espyo	most just start at September
2014-10-02 11:13:36	Yoshi2	might be because such details can be different in each country
2014-10-02 11:14:45	@Espyo	I guess
2014-10-02 11:19:30	Yoshi2	hm, I am unable to make sense of SMS's mSound.asn file
2014-10-02 11:20:51	@Espyo	yeah, Pikmin 2 doesn't have one of those, does it?
2014-10-02 11:21:04	Yoshi2	it does
2014-10-02 11:21:05	@Espyo	hm, the only variations of music in SMS that I can remember are the drums when you're riding Yoshi
2014-10-02 11:21:11	@Espyo	oh, my bad
2014-10-02 11:21:30	Yoshi2	I just wanted to have more BMS files to play around with
2014-10-02 11:21:44	Yoshi2	I think Wind Waker puts the BMS files into a RARC archive, so I guess I'll try that
2014-10-02 11:22:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-02 11:28:57	Yoshi2	I'll have to rethink the code for parsing events, I don't think it is compatible with non-Pikmin 2 games
2014-10-02 11:31:13	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-02 11:49:00	Yoshi2	there, I put the event parsing code in a file in a seperate folder
2014-10-02 11:49:39	Yoshi2	not a pretty solution, but it works
2014-10-02 11:51:25	@Espyo	hehe
2014-10-02 11:51:49	Yoshi2	now I need to, ugh, look at the windwaker file with a hex editor to see where it breaks
2014-10-02 11:53:35	@Espyo	oh boy, good luck
2014-10-02 11:56:21	Yoshi2	I am not looking forward to this
2014-10-02 11:58:37	@Espyo	I'd bet
2014-10-02 11:58:55	Yoshi2	strange, this didn't play any music at all
2014-10-02 12:02:15	@Espyo	uh...
2014-10-02 12:03:13	Yoshi2	yeah, this will be far more troublesome than I expected
2014-10-02 12:03:55	@Espyo	and you already expected it to be pretty bad
2014-10-02 12:04:00	@Espyo	dammit Nintendo, give us the documentation
2014-10-02 12:04:01	@Espyo	pretty please?
2014-10-02 12:04:42	Yoshi2	Nintendo is throwing lots of events into my path that have no data at all, what the hell
2014-10-02 12:05:11	@Espyo	lol
2014-10-02 12:05:21	Yoshi2	if I were to count how many events I wrote down that have no data following them, I would have, uhhh
2014-10-02 12:06:32	Yoshi2	7 events, one of which ends the track, and another makes the track return to an earlier point
2014-10-02 12:06:43	Yoshi2	5 events with unknown function
2014-10-02 12:07:05	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-02 12:07:19	Yoshi2	two of which I found in these WW files for the first time
2014-10-02 12:13:55	Yoshi2	wow
2014-10-02 12:14:02	Yoshi2	I think I did it
2014-10-02 12:14:07	@Espyo	oh?
2014-10-02 12:15:01	Yoshi2	looks like in Wind Waker, the event for setting the volume has three bytes of data
2014-10-02 12:15:12	Yoshi2	with that changed, I can now play the pirate theme
2014-10-02 12:15:22	Yoshi2	the tempo is completely wrong, but it plays
2014-10-02 12:15:32	@Espyo	ah, nice
2014-10-02 12:15:46	@Espyo	almost looks like all games switch the format in their own way
2014-10-02 12:15:54	@Espyo	why in the world would the volume even need three bytes?
2014-10-02 12:16:20	Yoshi2	no idea
2014-10-02 12:16:34	Yoshi2	I am still not sure what all those unknown events are which I need to parse
2014-10-02 12:18:05	@Espyo	hm, can't think of anything
2014-10-02 12:18:44	Yoshi2	I think it is actually smart of the SMS guy to start work on a MIDI->BMS converter, that way he could start to understand what the various unknown values are
2014-10-02 12:18:52	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-10-02 12:28:24	Yoshi2	... not funny, python
2014-10-02 12:29:23	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-10-02 12:29:45	Yoshi2	oh, I see
2014-10-02 12:31:15	Yoshi2	when you think that the programming language turned against you, look into the mirror and you will find the cause of the issue
2014-10-02 12:34:54	Yoshi2	I was wondering why the program failed to read an event and pointed towards the Pikmin 2 parser
2014-10-02 12:37:38	Yoshi2	I have played Wind Waker so much, but without the original instruments, the music pieces are difficult to recognize
2014-10-02 12:40:12	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> when you think that the programming language turned against you, look into the mirror and you will find the cause of the issue
2014-10-02 12:40:13	@Espyo	every single time
2014-10-02 12:40:19	@Espyo	it's never NOT true
2014-10-02 12:40:34	Yoshi2	yep
2014-10-02 12:40:40	@Espyo	yeah, I bet...
2014-10-02 12:40:47	@Espyo	you probably have pianos playing as trumpets and such, right?
2014-10-02 12:40:52	Yoshi2	very possible
2014-10-02 12:41:15	@Espyo	without knowing what maps to what, it'll be hard to, at least, have the correct instruments
2014-10-02 12:41:19	@Espyo	even if they don't sound the same as in-game
2014-10-02 12:43:45	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-02 12:44:52	Yoshi2	if there was a way to automatically analyze the sound files and map them towards instruments that sound similar, it would be fine
2014-10-02 12:46:21	@Espyo	that'd probably take a lot more to make than it would take to map them manually
2014-10-02 12:46:32	Yoshi2	well, depends
2014-10-02 12:47:01	Yoshi2	manually, you still have to listen to every instrument and make your own choices
2014-10-02 12:47:33	Yoshi2	automatically, you could try to use an existing algorithm for comparing music pieces
2014-10-02 12:49:12	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-02 12:49:17	@Espyo	wonder if there are any good ones, though
2014-10-02 12:49:27	Yoshi2	well
2014-10-02 12:49:52	Yoshi2	there should be some half-decent ones that work good enough
2014-10-02 12:50:08	@Espyo	hopefully
2014-10-02 12:51:52	Yoshi2	I only need a way to get the instrument files out of the standard soundfont
2014-10-02 12:52:24	@Espyo	I'm not sure if windows soundfont is... well, a regular one
2014-10-02 12:52:30	@Espyo	like, I don't think there's any .sf2 file anywhere
2014-10-02 12:52:35	@Espyo	but you download one
2014-10-02 12:52:42	@Espyo	I don't remember the name, though, but I know it's complex
2014-10-02 12:55:16	Yoshi2	but I think I shouldn't be sidetracked by such complex tasks
2014-10-02 12:55:58	@Espyo	of course
2014-10-02 12:56:24	@Espyo	speaking of which, do the instruments in Pikmin 2 match up with standard MIDI soundfont instruments?
2014-10-02 12:56:42	@Espyo	like, the ID for a flute in Pikmin 2 is the same as a MIDI soundfont's?
2014-10-02 12:56:56	@Espyo	because they sounded surprisingly well in your module
2014-10-02 12:58:32	Yoshi2	pikmin 2 definitely sounds quite good
2014-10-02 13:01:14	Yoshi2	oh
2014-10-02 13:01:35	Yoshi2	the reason why pikmin 2 sounds half-way decent is due to a bug in my code
2014-10-02 13:02:26	Yoshi2	with the bug fixed, the pygame variant sounds just as crappy as the midi variant in the media player
2014-10-02 13:02:32	@Espyo	haha
2014-10-02 13:03:59	Yoshi2	because I used the instrument bank number for the program number
2014-10-02 13:04:15	@Espyo	ah, I see
2014-10-02 13:06:34	Yoshi2	and now the code breaks when I play the zelda sounds
2014-10-02 13:09:24	Yoshi2	well, if I forcefully wrap the program number around so that it is always in the 0-127 range, it works again
2014-10-02 13:11:33	@Espyo	hehe
2014-10-02 13:11:35	@Espyo	brb, lunch
2014-10-02 13:20:08	Yoshi2	on the bright side, zelda sounds a bit more decent
2014-10-02 13:45:03	@Espyo	hm, that's good
2014-10-02 13:46:36	Yoshi2	though I am unable to play some of the BMS files
2014-10-02 13:46:57	@Espyo	same thing as Pikmin 2?
2014-10-02 13:47:24	Yoshi2	no, I don't think so
2014-10-02 13:47:58	Yoshi2	well, one file reminds me of Pikmin 2's se.bms file
2014-10-02 13:49:23	@Espyo	hmm, wouldn't know which one that is
2014-10-02 13:49:28	@Espyo	and I don't have theme here
2014-10-02 13:49:30	@Espyo	*them
2014-10-02 13:53:12	Yoshi2	in that it uses a 0xAD event which I have seen only in P2's se.bms and Wind Waker's d_ganon1.bms file so far
2014-10-02 13:53:39	Yoshi2	and you are not missing much because I am unable to play the se.bms file
2014-10-02 13:54:12	@Espyo	ah, I see
2014-10-02 14:11:10	Yoshi2	well, next step will be to wrap this project up with a nice command line interface, then try to make a Pikmin 2 soundfont 
2014-10-02 14:12:17	@Espyo	hm

2014-10-02 15:57:51	Yoshi2	MIDIUtil is a library with a good license
2014-10-02 15:58:09	@Espyo	never heard of it, but give it a try
2014-10-02 15:58:55	Yoshi2	the way it handles notes is too high level for myself, though
2014-10-02 15:59:13	Yoshi2	maybe it has a low level interface, too
2014-10-02 15:59:54	@Espyo	hopefully

2014-10-02 17:58:41	Yoshi2	and in MIDIutil, pitch goes from 0 to 127, while the normal pitch controller goes from 0 to 2**14-1#
2014-10-02 17:59:26	Yoshi2	which is 16383
2014-10-02 17:59:28	@Espyo	drat
2014-10-02 17:59:31	Yoshi2	seriously
2014-10-02 17:59:35	Yoshi2	I give up on this lib
2014-10-02 17:59:54	@Espyo	:(

2014-10-02 18:02:21	@Espyo	yeah, try that
2014-10-02 18:03:09	Yoshi2	I just need to check the midi specifications because I really wonder what midiutil is doing with pitch
2014-10-02 18:04:22	Yoshi2	http://www.gweep.net/~prefect/eng/reference/protocol/midispec.html#On no pitch data in the note on events
2014-10-02 18:06:04	Yoshi2	oh
2014-10-02 18:06:05	Yoshi2	wow
2014-10-02 18:06:21	Yoshi2	what midiutil calls "pitch" is actually the note
2014-10-02 18:06:58	@Espyo	woaah
2014-10-02 18:07:01	Yoshi2	seriously
2014-10-02 18:07:02	Yoshi2	why.
2014-10-02 18:07:05	@Espyo	"tone", maybe
2014-10-02 18:07:09	@Espyo	but pitch?
2014-10-02 18:07:28	Yoshi2	especially because midi already has an event related to pitch, this is just misleading
2014-10-02 18:07:47	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-02 18:11:14	Yoshi2	the library has angered me, I will now hack it apart
2014-10-02 18:11:40	@Espyo	work that sucker to death
2014-10-02 18:12:00	Yoshi2	did I mention that the library does not have the midi pitch controller? I'll have to add that one too
2014-10-02 18:13:38	@Espyo	eeeesh
2014-10-02 18:14:16	Yoshi2	it would almost be easier to write my own midi writer
2014-10-02 18:14:23	Yoshi2	but only almost, so I'm not going to do that
2014-10-02 18:15:12	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-02 18:23:06	Yoshi2	instead of modifying the file directly, I think I will try to subclass it

2014-10-02 20:04:01	Yoshi2	welcome back, Espyo 
2014-10-02 20:05:47	@Espyo	thanks
2014-10-02 20:06:38	Yoshi2	I give up with subclassing
2014-10-02 20:06:48	Yoshi2	I have to replace so many things, it is better to just edit the file directly
2014-10-02 20:16:16	Yoshi2	on the first sight midiutil looked like a nice library
2014-10-02 20:16:21	Yoshi2	but it is so horribly written
2014-10-02 20:16:30	@Espyo	huh, yeah...
2014-10-02 20:16:35	Yoshi2	making extending it impossible
2014-10-02 20:16:40	@Espyo	that happens more than it should, being horribly written
2014-10-02 20:17:25	Yoshi2	fun fact: When you add a note in midiutil, it creates a GenericEvent which it appends to an event list
2014-10-02 20:17:27	Yoshi2	so far so good
2014-10-02 20:17:55	Yoshi2	when you are done, it takes every GenericEvent and puts the stuff into a MIDIEvent
2014-10-02 20:18:18	Yoshi2	it then monkeypatches the MIDIEvent to contain the same data as the GenericEvent
2014-10-02 20:18:48	Yoshi2	and when you write the entire thing to a file, it goes through the MIDIEvents and then writes the data in a binary format
2014-10-02 20:19:21	Yoshi2	which isn't too bad, except the steps GenericEvent->MIDIEvent and MIDIEvent->Binary data are hardcoded
2014-10-02 20:20:08	Yoshi2	if you want to add a new event, you will have to do it in at least two different places
2014-10-02 20:20:45	@Espyo	woah boy
2014-10-02 20:21:12	Yoshi2	I'll try to rip out the GenericEvent->MIDIEvent part, it is completely unnecessary
2014-10-02 20:21:58	Yoshi2	hmm
2014-10-02 20:22:33	Yoshi2	I give
2014-10-02 20:22:37	Yoshi2	*I give up
2014-10-02 20:22:42	@Espyo	I would too
2014-10-02 20:23:03	Yoshi2	I'll just write my own midi thing, can't be that difficult
2014-10-02 20:23:12	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-02 20:24:00	Yoshi2	I already have an event sheduler, so I don't need this high level stuff
2014-10-02 20:30:52	Yoshi2	I should've done this earlier, I would probably be done by now
2014-10-02 20:36:42	@Espyo	yeah, likely
2014-10-02 21:11:37	Yoshi2	well, at least it will be more enjoyable
2014-10-02 21:11:51	Yoshi2	I have already written an encoder for the variable length values :)
2014-10-02 21:12:46	Yoshi2	midiutil doesn't even implement the VLE encoder properly, it just assumes that all values are 4 bytes long
2014-10-02 21:30:34	@Espyo	that's always good
2014-10-02 21:30:40	@Espyo	and that is always bad
2014-10-02 21:32:44	Yoshi2	my midi module should have basic functionality now :)
2014-10-02 21:32:54	Yoshi2	I'm really suprised how simple the midi format is
2014-10-02 21:33:13	Yoshi2	I am not an audio engineer, but writing a parser for that format is very easy
2014-10-02 21:36:06	@Espyo	I read a bit on it some months ago, and yeah, it's pretty easy to understand
2014-10-02 21:40:32	Yoshi2	sadly, it doesn't play correctly in the media player
2014-10-02 21:48:00	@Espyo	damn
2014-10-02 21:48:12	Yoshi2	ah, I forgot to write the end of track
2014-10-02 21:49:51	Yoshi2	nope, still breaks
2014-10-02 21:50:00	Yoshi2	hmm, I'll need to poke it with a hex editor
2014-10-02 21:53:46	Yoshi2	ohhh
2014-10-02 21:55:03	Yoshi2	now it works
2014-10-02 21:55:46	@Espyo	heh
2014-10-02 21:55:58	Yoshi2	I forgot to put a time update in front of the end of track
2014-10-02 22:03:22	Yoshi2	now to plug it into my converter
2014-10-02 22:09:07	Yoshi2	ahhh, it works
2014-10-02 22:13:13	@Espyo	nice
2014-10-02 22:13:26	Yoshi2	now to get all the events done
2014-10-02 22:14:23	@Espyo	go go go
2014-10-02 22:15:26	Yoshi2	time to check my mails
2014-10-02 22:15:35	Yoshi2	wooo, he replied
2014-10-02 22:18:29	@Espyo	hurray!
2014-10-02 22:19:01	Yoshi2	0xFD and 0xFE events set the BPM and PPQN values
2014-10-02 22:19:12	Yoshi2	good to know!
2014-10-02 22:20:59	Yoshi2	and as I thought, BMS cannot be converted to midi without loss of information
2014-10-02 22:21:25	@Espyo	ah, excellent
2014-10-02 22:21:29	@Espyo	aww
2014-10-02 22:21:35	@Espyo	but yeah, I had a feeling that'd be the case too
2014-10-02 22:21:39	Yoshi2	it also has some events which have no equivalent in midi
2014-10-02 22:21:59	Yoshi2	specifically the ones for jumping to a specific point in the track
2014-10-02 22:22:31	Yoshi2	I guess the way I am doing it right now is the most viable way to do it without using some tricks
2014-10-02 22:22:42	Yoshi2	or different implementations of midi
2014-10-02 22:23:13	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-02 22:24:22	Yoshi2	that means I'll add an option to the command line interface which specifies how long the BMS file should be running
2014-10-02 22:24:37	Yoshi2	and maybe even have it start at a specific point
2014-10-02 22:24:38	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-02 22:25:03	Yoshi2	in one of my tests I created a 1 hour version of one of the music files
2014-10-02 22:25:48	@Espyo	did it work ok?
2014-10-02 22:26:19	Yoshi2	it plays and sounds alright
2014-10-02 22:26:35	Yoshi2	not sure if the timing stays correct, though
2014-10-02 22:28:11	@Espyo	yeah, that's a problem
2014-10-02 22:30:10	Yoshi2	it could be the way the BMS file is built, or a bug in my code

2014-10-02 22:32:23	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-02 22:34:49	@J	I believe EU Pikmin 2 doesn't run at 30FPS
2014-10-02 22:35:08	@J	...though it was a long time ago I checked
2014-10-02 22:35:28	@Espyo	I checked
2014-10-02 22:35:31	@J	this is actually looking at whether frames change, not using Dolphin and seeing how often it's actually pushing frames
2014-10-02 22:35:36	@Espyo	I checked when I wrote {{frames}}

2014-10-02 22:35:43	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-02 22:35:54	@Espyo	how would you be able to tell, really?
2014-10-02 22:36:04	@J	not by eye, if that's what you mean
2014-10-02 22:36:09	@J	oh
2014-10-02 22:36:13	@J	missed the 'how'
2014-10-02 22:36:16	@J	record it 
2014-10-02 22:36:35	@J	now I think about it, I might be confusing it with Luigi's Mansion
2014-10-02 22:36:57	@Espyo	hm
2014-10-02 22:37:05	@J	but I had a feeling lots of (all?) PAL GCN games running at half framerate did that
2014-10-02 22:38:01	Yoshi2	Pal Pikmin 2 has both an 60 Hz and a 50 Hz option, so it should be running the same as every other version
2014-10-02 22:38:31	@Espyo	no other menu in Pikmin 2 runs at 60, if that's what you're saying, J
2014-10-02 22:38:53	@J	no, I'm not talking about full vs half framerate
2014-10-02 22:39:21	@J	wouldn't it be weird for it to run at 30 if you chose 50Hz output?
2014-10-02 22:41:31	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-02 22:41:41	@Espyo	the 50/60Hz mode is kind of weird
2014-10-02 22:41:51	@Espyo	specially if you force your GC to be 50, which I did
2014-10-02 22:41:59	@Espyo	so I think it tries to have an effect, but doesn't
2014-10-02 22:42:02	@J	oh, wait a minute
2014-10-02 22:42:06	@Espyo	"tries" because I swear I see my TV flicker when it "changes"
2014-10-02 22:42:09	@Espyo	I... I just don't know
2014-10-02 22:42:24	@J	maybe the thing I'm thinking of is exactly that - that it runs at 30 FPS with 50Hz output
2014-10-02 22:42:38	@J	because I remember the pattern being AABCC
2014-10-02 22:42:49	@Espyo	pattern...
2014-10-02 22:43:00	@J	frame pattern in the recorded output
2014-10-02 22:43:07	@J	AA means 2 frames the same
2014-10-02 22:43:18	Yoshi2	interesting
2014-10-02 22:43:34	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-10-02 22:43:35	@Espyo	makes sense
2014-10-02 22:43:46	@J	so wait, what does that give in a 50FPS video?
2014-10-02 22:43:58	@J	3 new frames every 5 frames
2014-10-02 22:44:02	@J	so 30FPS, right?
2014-10-02 22:44:15	@Espyo	I'd imagine s
2014-10-02 22:44:16	@Espyo	*o
2014-10-02 22:44:25	@J	okay, you can probably ignore everything I said, then
2014-10-02 23:01:40	@J	okay, UI question: actions like paste are sometimes insensitive in window menus or context menus based on context (can't paste if there's nothing cut/copied)
2014-10-02 23:01:51	@J	but what about always-visible buttons?
2014-10-02 23:02:12	@J	would it be strange for their sensitivity to visibly change as you do things?
2014-10-02 23:02:28	@J	instead, should they just do nothing when activated if there's nothing to do?
2014-10-02 23:02:52	@J	OTOH, it seems to me that always-visible undo and redo buttons _should_ change sensitivity as you do stuff
2014-10-02 23:03:04	@J	so now I'm confused
2014-10-02 23:05:43	@Espyo	wait, what
2014-10-02 23:05:53	@Espyo	how
2014-10-02 23:05:53	Yoshi2	I am not sure what "sensitivity" means in this context
2014-10-02 23:05:57	@Espyo	how do you paste on a context menu?
2014-10-02 23:06:06	@Espyo	maybe I'm just sleepy, or maybe you are
2014-10-02 23:06:08	@J	no, the paste button is in the menu
2014-10-02 23:06:23	@Espyo	oh
2014-10-02 23:06:24	@J	an 'insensitive' button is a button you can't click; it's usually rendered greyed out
2014-10-02 23:06:36	@Espyo	ah, ok
2014-10-02 23:06:48	@Espyo	windows things just call it "disabled"
2014-10-02 23:07:03	@J	fair enough
2014-10-02 23:07:04	@Espyo	<J> would it be strange for their sensitivity to visibly change as you do things?
2014-10-02 23:07:08	@Espyo	can't remember any program that DOESN'T

2014-10-02 23:09:43	@Espyo	what
2014-10-02 23:09:51	@Espyo	you haven't realized I've been editing the main page for like 4 days now?
2014-10-02 23:10:01	@Espyo	with a sandbox on one of my user subpages?

2014-10-02 23:10:35	@Espyo	I know you commented on something of it yesterday or so
2014-10-02 23:10:40	@J	nope
2014-10-02 23:13:14	@J	so yeah, I guess I don't really use many programs like normal people
2014-10-02 23:13:22	@J	normal mouse-clicking people
2014-10-02 23:14:49	@J	I guess I feel like it seems weird with a file manager because it would change a lot
2014-10-02 23:14:56	@Espyo	well, I don't use right-click either for most things
2014-10-02 23:15:00	@Espyo	shortcut keys all the way
2014-10-02 23:15:21	@J	not just for operations - but, for example, you can only copy a file if you have one selected
2014-10-02 23:15:54	@J	I don't mean just shortcuts versus context menus, but I just use whole different types of interfaces
2014-10-02 23:16:19	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2014-10-02 23:16:21	@Espyo	but still
2014-10-02 23:16:21	@J	I just opened up a word processor to check stuff, and realised I haven't used one for years
2014-10-02 23:16:27	@Espyo	hehehe
2014-10-02 23:18:35	Yoshi2	problem: midi has no event for changing the tempo of a track while playing it
2014-10-02 23:19:17	@J	so BMS has more features than MIDI?
2014-10-02 23:19:19	Yoshi2	solution: have a specific tempo and change the relative length of ticks between each note when a BPM change is encountered
2014-10-02 23:19:55	Yoshi2	J: can't say if it has more features, but it does have features which midi doesn't have
2014-10-02 23:20:27	@J	mm
2014-10-02 23:20:58	Yoshi2	there are a ton of events in BMS which are not yet understood
2014-10-02 23:21:18	@Espyo	hm
2014-10-02 23:21:27	@J	you have to wonder why they don't really tend to use standard formats for anything
2014-10-02 23:21:36	@J	seems it's generally for performance reasons
2014-10-02 23:22:27	Yoshi2	I guess they thought that the midi standard doesn't cover what they need, so they created their own format
2014-10-02 23:23:00	@J	well, it's not just that
2014-10-02 23:23:07	Yoshi2	one of the interesting parts of BMS is having a track loop around, jump to a different part of the track, go back again
2014-10-02 23:23:31	@J	like, the image format they use for banners is crazy - each pixel can individually be one of 2 formats, but it's otherwise essentially a bitmap
2014-10-02 23:23:32	Yoshi2	essentially creating an infinite loop of the music track
2014-10-02 23:25:33	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> I guess they thought that the midi standard doesn't cover what they need, so they created their own format
2014-10-02 23:25:38	@Espyo	that's what I always thought
2014-10-02 23:25:49	@Espyo	but mostly performance — that's the reason *I* make my own stuff
2014-10-02 23:25:59	@Espyo	other things work for everybody, but that comes at the price of performance
2014-10-02 23:26:07	@Espyo	and no J, you aren't allowed to bash my performance nitpicks any more
2014-10-02 23:26:13	@Espyo	the engine is REALLY chugging now
2014-10-02 23:27:30	Yoshi2	that likely plays a factor too

2014-10-03 09:34:47	@Espyo	morning
2014-10-03 10:18:38	Yoshi2	nevermind what I said about midi not having an option to change the tempo mid-track
2014-10-03 10:18:54	Yoshi2	it's one of the meta events
2014-10-03 10:18:56	@Espyo	ah, yeah, I could swear it did
2014-10-03 10:19:23	@Espyo	I didn't think much of it yesterday, but yeah, of course they do
2014-10-03 10:19:33	@Espyo	one of the mechanics in Mother 3 is hitting the enemy to the beat of the music
2014-10-03 10:19:43	@Espyo	and some people were able to extract Mother 3's music to MIDI files
2014-10-03 10:19:46	@Espyo	keeping the tempo changes
2014-10-03 10:20:17	@Espyo	wait, is there any song in Pikmin 2 that changes tempo halfway through?
2014-10-03 10:21:22	Yoshi2	don't know yet
2014-10-03 10:22:22	@Espyo	if so, then maybe the Wistful Wild's theme, the last area in the game
2014-10-03 10:22:26	@Espyo	aptly named internally "last"

2014-10-03 12:09:50	Yoshi2	another email sent to the SMS guy \o/
2014-10-03 12:10:02	Yoshi2	eventually, we will have this figured out completely
2014-10-03 12:11:48	@Espyo	yeah, eventually
2014-10-03 12:12:43	Yoshi2	it is all about time
2014-10-03 12:12:44	Yoshi2	and data
2014-10-03 12:12:48	Yoshi2	and we have plenty of data
2014-10-03 12:13:57	@Espyo	yep
2014-10-03 12:34:52	Yoshi2	worst case: I extract the subroutine data from the BMS files and assemble it in a way that makes sense
2014-10-03 12:35:03	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-03 12:35:39	Yoshi2	nobody says that you HAVE to parse the tracks from 0, right? :D
2014-10-03 12:37:23	@Espyo	well, nope
2014-10-03 13:31:53	Yoshi2	BPM support added \o/
2014-10-03 13:32:33	Yoshi2	if I manage to add support for PPQN too, the tempo should be fine
2014-10-03 13:44:20	@Espyo	nice
2014-10-03 13:44:31	@Espyo	wouldn't PPQN be the time signature?
2014-10-03 13:45:46	Yoshi2	hm, I don't think so
2014-10-03 13:45:55	Yoshi2	but I find BPM and PPQN very confusing
2014-10-03 13:46:13	@Espyo	because you don't know their music theory definitions?
2014-10-03 13:46:20	@Espyo	or because they're implemented weird here?
2014-10-03 13:48:18	Yoshi2	both of your statements are true, in a way
2014-10-03 13:48:43	Yoshi2	I don't think the midi tempo events differentiate between BPM and PPQN
2014-10-03 13:48:55	@Espyo	they shouldn't
2014-10-03 13:49:05	@Espyo	and I don't think PPQN is a thing in actual music theory
2014-10-03 13:49:15	@Espyo	I can't help with time signatures, I never really understood them
2014-10-03 13:49:23	@Espyo	ugh, I wish music theory were easier :(
2014-10-03 13:49:37	Yoshi2	I'm not sure if time signatures actually have an effect here
2014-10-03 13:49:54	@Espyo	they probably shouldn't
2014-10-03 13:50:10	@Espyo	time signatures are a good thing to keep in MIDI for composition and studying purposes
2014-10-03 13:50:26	@Espyo	if you're just playing them in a game, it doesn't matter what the time signature is written as
2014-10-03 13:50:42	Yoshi2	I doubt Nintendo planned to do that, so PPQN probably have a more functional use
2014-10-03 13:51:02	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-03 13:51:09	@Espyo	what's PPQN again? something per quarter note
2014-10-03 13:51:17	Yoshi2	pulses per quarter note
2014-10-03 13:51:31	@Espyo	what's a pulse?
2014-10-03 13:51:33	@Espyo	a beat?
2014-10-03 13:52:38	Yoshi2	probably not, because BPM is already beats per minute
2014-10-03 13:52:43	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-10-03 13:52:52	@Espyo	a frame?
2014-10-03 13:52:59	Yoshi2	PPQN probably decides the resolution of a beat
2014-10-03 13:53:17	@Espyo	if so, I think that's what the time signature is
2014-10-03 13:53:24	@Espyo	unless I'm seeing all of this in the wrong angle
2014-10-03 13:53:55	Yoshi2	I see it as an extension of the BPM value
2014-10-03 13:54:54	Yoshi2	and now the Pikmin 2 intro plays very quickly
2014-10-03 13:54:59	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-03 13:55:16	Yoshi2	maybe that is the way it should be
2014-10-03 13:55:53	Yoshi2	hm, what if I remove the PPQN thing
2014-10-03 13:56:10	@Espyo	try it
2014-10-03 13:56:33	Yoshi2	still very fast
2014-10-03 13:56:48	@Espyo	nuts
2014-10-03 13:57:06	@Espyo	what are you using the calculate the final tempo? BPM / PPQN?
2014-10-03 13:57:45	Yoshi2	for BPM, I use 6000000/BPM
2014-10-03 13:57:57	@Espyo	woah
2014-10-03 13:57:58	Yoshi2	for PPQN, I use 6000000/(BPM*PPQN)
2014-10-03 14:00:12	Yoshi2	hm, the speed doesn't seem to be too bad
2014-10-03 14:00:44	Yoshi2	sounds about right when I compare it to the Pikmin 2 theme in videos
2014-10-03 14:01:03	Yoshi2	192 BPM
2014-10-03 14:01:22	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-10-03 14:02:11	Yoshi2	as a bonus, when I remove the PPQN thing, the instruments change
2014-10-03 14:02:15	Yoshi2	I have no idea why that happens
2014-10-03 14:02:21	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-10-03 14:02:28	@Espyo	that sounds incredibly glitchy
2014-10-03 14:04:42	Yoshi2	wait, I was using the windwaker parser again
2014-10-03 14:05:07	Yoshi2	nope, no difference
2014-10-03 14:05:08	Yoshi2	very odd
2014-10-03 14:05:37	@Espyo	heh
2014-10-03 14:11:05	Yoshi2	I'd love to say "I messed up somewhere"
2014-10-03 14:11:08	Yoshi2	but I have no idea where
2014-10-03 14:11:32	@Espyo	the worst kind of mess up
2014-10-03 14:13:08	Yoshi2	the kind of mess up where you change one thing and it is fine again
2014-10-03 14:13:32	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-03 14:13:44	Yoshi2	...
2014-10-03 14:13:56	Yoshi2	I am fairly positive that the system is changing instrument banks behind my back
2014-10-03 14:14:12	@Espyo	uninitialized variables?
2014-10-03 14:14:17	@Espyo	if that's even a thing, in Python
2014-10-03 14:21:08	Yoshi2	hmm
2014-10-03 14:36:17	Yoshi2	I am really unsure about what I did to mess up the instruments
2014-10-03 14:36:59	@Espyo	but did you fix it?
2014-10-03 14:39:53	Yoshi2	not yet
2014-10-03 14:40:42	@Espyo	it's probably very obvious once you find the problem
2014-10-03 14:44:04	Yoshi2	hmmm
2014-10-03 14:44:09	Yoshi2	I think I'm realizing something
2014-10-03 14:45:58	Yoshi2	some of the controllers I thought existed don't actually exist
2014-10-03 14:46:08	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-03 14:46:26	Yoshi2	the volume event is actually three bytes, two of which define the volume
2014-10-03 14:46:36	@Espyo	what's the third?
2014-10-03 14:46:46	Yoshi2	the third is part of the volume
2014-10-03 14:46:51	Yoshi2	it's the first byte that is unknown
2014-10-03 14:47:02	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-03 14:47:33	Yoshi2	it just so happens that the third byte looks like an event because its hex value starts with a letter
2014-10-03 14:48:04	@Espyo	aaah
2014-10-03 14:48:32	Yoshi2	that probably has nothing to do with the problem at hand, but it should improve parsing
2014-10-03 14:48:39	@Espyo	mhm
2014-10-03 15:10:28	Yoshi2	ok
2014-10-03 15:10:47	Yoshi2	I just realized that my program event writer doesn't actually do anything
2014-10-03 15:11:02	@Espyo	hah
2014-10-03 15:13:31	Yoshi2	it will be funny if this is the actual cause of the error
2014-10-03 15:19:02	Yoshi2	but no, no dice
2014-10-03 15:20:40	@Espyo	drat
2014-10-03 15:22:47	Yoshi2	I do have an idea for how to debug it
2014-10-03 15:22:55	Yoshi2	I manually set the instruments to specific numbers
2014-10-03 15:23:15	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-03 15:26:48	Yoshi2	odd, so far the instruments sound exactly the same
2014-10-03 15:27:31	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-03 15:29:10	Yoshi2	hmm
2014-10-03 15:29:14	Yoshi2	hmmmmmmmmm
2014-10-03 15:29:58	Yoshi2	I have a theory
2014-10-03 15:30:13	Yoshi2	but if the theory is correct, it would really suck
2014-10-03 15:31:04	Yoshi2	sigh
2014-10-03 15:31:28	Yoshi2	that's what I feared, I guess you cannot set instruments per track
2014-10-03 15:32:32	@Espyo	uh, how so?
2014-10-03 15:32:43	Yoshi2	hm, either that or I messed up somewhere
2014-10-03 15:36:46	Yoshi2	Espyo: as far as I can tell, if track 1 and track 2 each set an instrument for channel 0, only the latest instrument will count
2014-10-03 15:40:54	@Espyo	one sec
2014-10-03 15:43:15	Yoshi2	hmm, it looks like it
2014-10-03 15:43:31	Yoshi2	now the music sounds just like in pygame :D
2014-10-03 15:43:41	Yoshi2	which means that it sounds just as crappy
2014-10-03 15:46:20	@Espyo	hehe
2014-10-03 15:46:21	@Espyo	oh, I see
2014-10-03 15:46:50	Yoshi2	as an bonus, I think playing multiple notes at the same time is fixed too
2014-10-03 15:47:02	Yoshi2	before it sounded very clear due to less note madness
2014-10-03 15:47:15	@Espyo	oh, nice

2014-10-04 12:36:56	@Espyo	if on MediaWiki, ops are called sysops
2014-10-04 12:37:00	@Espyo	why aren't admins called sysadmins
2014-10-04 12:37:42	Yoshi2	I'm an user, can I be called sysuser?
2014-10-04 12:37:52	@Espyo	you know what, you should

2014-10-04 12:39:29	Yoshi2	we live in a sysworld with syspeople and sysanimals, we live in our syshomes and eat sysfood
2014-10-04 12:39:37	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-04 12:40:31	Yoshi2	I thought Pikmin 1 would also use an .aaf file just like SMS and Pikmin 2, but so far I have not found one
2014-10-04 12:42:58	Yoshi2	Pikmin 1 doesn't even seem to use RARC archives very often
2014-10-04 12:43:06	Yoshi2	well, compressed RARC archives
2014-10-04 12:43:49	@J	why did you have to say where you had the thought

2014-10-04 13:10:17	Yoshi2	on the one hand, it seems that I can parse this .aaf file easily with information from the source code of wwdumpsnd
2014-10-04 13:10:44	Yoshi2	on the other hand, I'll have to figure out what information from the file is useful
2014-10-04 13:11:26	Yoshi2	maybe Pikmin 2's aaf file contains track information
2014-10-04 13:20:35	Yoshi2	but if Pikmin 1 really doesn't have an aaf file, that means I'll probably have to parse the weird stx files for track information
2014-10-04 13:22:51	@Espyo	yeah
2014-10-04 13:53:30	Yoshi2	now I dumped the different "sectors" from the aaf file into different files
2014-10-04 13:53:43	Yoshi2	I should probably add that as a different tool
2014-10-04 13:58:14	Yoshi2	and here is the BARC header, just as that guy mentioned
2014-10-04 14:01:09	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-10-04 14:13:26	Yoshi2	ah, this is quite easy to parse
2014-10-04 14:13:54	Yoshi2	I think I almost got it
2014-10-04 14:14:00	@Espyo	ah, nice
2014-10-04 14:15:25	Yoshi2	8 bytes header, 4 bytes unknown, 4 bytes entry count, 12 bytes sequence archive name, 4 bytes unknown
2014-10-04 14:15:59	Yoshi2	for each entry count, there is 13 bytes of truncated song name, 3 bytes of what I'd call padding, 4 bytes unknown, 4 bytes unknown and constant, 4 bytes start, 4 bytes end
2014-10-04 14:16:12	Yoshi2	I love formats which are straightforward
2014-10-04 14:23:56	Yoshi2	aaaand done
2014-10-04 14:24:32	Yoshi2	now I've got a big bunch of bms files from SMS
2014-10-04 14:27:15	Yoshi2	and of course I am unable to play the bms files
2014-10-04 14:29:11	Yoshi2	oh
2014-10-04 14:29:37	Yoshi2	the 4 bytes aren't for the end of the file, they are for the size of the file

2014-10-04 14:42:04	@Espyo	awesome
2014-10-04 14:44:41	Yoshi2	with a bit of work, I am now somewhat able to play SMS bms files
2014-10-04 14:44:50	Yoshi2	the tempo is completely off though, hmm
2014-10-04 14:45:23	Yoshi2	at least in the live player
2014-10-04 14:45:58	@Espyo	hmm
2014-10-04 14:46:06	@Espyo	the tempo is always screwing you over
2014-10-04 14:46:10	@Espyo	there's gotta be some secret
2014-10-04 14:46:10	Yoshi2	of course, because it does not support tempo changing
2014-10-04 14:51:12	@Espyo	I... didn't realize this existed http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=347412#347412
2014-10-04 14:56:54	Yoshi2	alright, now the tempo seems alright in the live player
2014-10-04 14:58:33	Yoshi2	the super mario sunshine files sound suprisingly good, despite the soundfont being wrong
2014-10-04 15:01:00	Yoshi2	hmm, my player DEFINITELY has a problem with timing
2014-10-04 15:02:34	Yoshi2	either that, or there are some unknown commands that handle timing

2014-10-04 15:18:49	@Espyo	very good question
2014-10-04 15:18:55	@Espyo	when your ISP sucks, magic things like that can happen
2014-10-04 15:25:40	Yoshi2	indeed
2014-10-04 15:26:02	Yoshi2	but it can also happen that the IRC network sucks
2014-10-04 15:26:17	Yoshi2	on a different network I time out very often, while everywhere else I stay connected
2014-10-04 15:27:47	@Espyo	no, I disconnected EVERYWHERE
2014-10-04 15:30:48	Yoshi2	in that case your ISP does suck
2014-10-04 15:31:27	Yoshi2	Espyo: the default MIDI instruments fit Super Mario Sunshine much better than Pikmin 2
2014-10-04 15:31:33	@Espyo	nice
2014-10-04 15:31:45	@Espyo	yeah, my ISP's been giving me crap service lately
2014-10-04 15:31:56	@Espyo	can't stay a full 20 seconds without it dropping to horrible speeds occasionally
2014-10-04 15:32:04	@Espyo	...sometimes occasionally, other times, almost always
2014-10-04 15:32:08	@Espyo	(that sentence made sense)
2014-10-04 15:32:22	Yoshi2	the BMS train has no brakes, so I think I'll try to dump the Pikmin 1 music later today
2014-10-04 15:32:47	@Espyo	that would be incredible
2014-10-04 15:33:11	Yoshi2	well, at least I'll look into those weird files, hopefully they contain something about the music structure
2014-10-04 15:47:35	Testyo	why you won't survive in life
2014-10-04 15:53:34	@Espyo	wut
2014-10-04 15:53:50	Yoshi2	I feel a bit insulted
2014-10-04 15:54:29	@Espyo	I would too
2014-10-04 15:54:31	@Espyo	the hell, Testyo
2014-10-04 15:54:32	Testyo	damn ....
2014-10-04 15:54:44	@Espyo	are you sorry, Testyo?
2014-10-04 15:54:45	Testyo	hmm what I thought
2014-10-04 16:03:41	Yoshi2	SMS has a music piece with the letters "se"
2014-10-04 16:04:04	Yoshi2	I did mention how I was unable to parse Pikmin 2's "se.bms" file, now take a guess if I managed to parse this one
2014-10-04 16:06:23	@Espyo	guessing you didn't
2014-10-04 16:06:38	Yoshi2	indeed, there is something with nintendo making files called "se" more difficult to parse
2014-10-04 16:06:55	@Espyo	stands for Sucks to Edit
2014-10-04 16:07:04	Yoshi2	and I am currently looking at the .stx files
2014-10-04 16:07:57	Yoshi2	those are HUGE
2014-10-04 16:08:15	Yoshi2	bigger than the archive containing the music files
2014-10-04 16:08:53	Yoshi2	they problably do not contain information on the structure of the music archive
2014-10-04 16:13:23	Yoshi2	I'll write a script to search the pikmin 1 file structure for RARC or yaz0 files, or files containing a BARC string
2014-10-04 16:14:25	@Espyo	probably better
2014-10-04 16:17:51	Yoshi2	nothing is more satisfying than watching a long list of files scrolling through the console as the script searches through files
2014-10-04 16:21:03	Yoshi2	nope, no rarc archives, no yaz0-compressed files, no files containing BARC
2014-10-04 16:21:16	Yoshi2	maybe I should look for files that reference the sequence archive

2014-10-04 16:23:37	Yoshi2_	when I said "no files containing BARC", I excluded the Start.dol and one of the stx files
2014-10-04 16:23:50	Yoshi2_	guess what, they backed the barc archive into the Start.dol
2014-10-04 16:24:25	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-10-04 16:24:55	Yoshi2_	pikise, sysevent, tutorial, play3, d_end2, jungle, yaku, cave, boss2, map, demobgm, boss3, flow, select, char, cresult, fresult, and 5 dummy entries

2014-10-04 20:14:51	Yoshi2	if I had to categorize the BMS version of Pikmin 1, 2, Wind Waker and Super Mario Sunshine, I think I'd put together Pikmin 1 with SMS, and WW with Pikmin 2

2014-10-04 20:17:35	@Espyo	probably makes sense
