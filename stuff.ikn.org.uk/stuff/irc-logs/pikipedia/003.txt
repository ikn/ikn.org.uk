2014-02-02 23:23:11	Miles	Like, if the max was 10, you could have 10 regular Pikmin and 10 Wingeds at the same time... Except not really because as soon as you get the number of wingeds needed to carry it they'll start flying and the rest will let go
2014-02-02 23:23:25	Espyo	well yeah
2014-02-02 23:23:36	Espyo	but one thing is the max, the other is the number needed to carry
2014-02-02 23:23:45	Espyo	by max, we mean max spots possible to grab on to
2014-02-02 23:23:50	Miles	It's always the same
2014-02-02 23:23:53	TehPehEhm	Umm
2014-02-02 23:23:54	Miles	Would be really weird if it wasn't

2014-02-03 00:18:48	@PikFan	so no one was out
2014-02-03 00:19:14	Espyo	what do you mean?
2014-02-03 00:19:24	@PikFan	there was nobody outside
2014-02-03 00:19:38	@PikFan	or at least, could come outside
2014-02-03 00:19:42	Espyo	hm
2014-02-03 00:28:22	@PikFan	also, about the Sunseed Berry problem
2014-02-03 00:28:33	Espyo	we have a problem with that?
2014-02-03 00:28:46	@PikFan	you know, the infoboxes and the image?
2014-02-03 00:28:52	Espyo	oh, right
2014-02-03 00:28:59	Espyo	infoboxes are still a mess that hasn't been fixed
2014-02-03 00:29:16	@PikFan	maybe we could move the fruit infobox down to the P3 section
2014-02-03 00:29:32	Espyo	not sure if it'd help much
2014-02-03 00:30:18	@PikFan	yeah, the problem is when there's more than one infobox
2014-02-03 00:30:35	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-03 00:31:10	Espyo	you never commented on my edit
2014-02-03 00:31:23	Espyo	everything right? everything wrong? any other comment?
2014-02-03 00:31:27	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-03 00:31:37	@PikFan	there was one thing I found

2014-02-03 00:32:44	Espyo	oh yeah
2014-02-03 00:33:09	@PikFan	and how does it look now? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sunseed_Berry
2014-02-03 00:33:25	@PikFan	the game icon is covering the edit button...
2014-02-03 00:33:42	Espyo	hmm...
2014-02-03 00:33:45	Espyo	it's better somewhat
2014-02-03 00:33:57	Espyo	we're gonna have to use Javascript, there's no other way
2014-02-03 00:34:02	Espyo	rather, there is another way
2014-02-03 00:34:04	Espyo	the /long/ way
2014-02-03 00:34:06	Espyo	like SmashWiki does
2014-02-03 00:34:16	Espyo	no template ever calls the icons
2014-02-03 00:34:19	Espyo	it's all done per-article
2014-02-03 00:34:52	@PikFan	I vote for the latter
2014-02-03 00:35:06	Espyo	the long way?
2014-02-03 00:35:11	@PikFan	yes
2014-02-03 00:35:18	Espyo	without JS, there's no other way other than that...
2014-02-03 00:35:34	@PikFan	well, how long would it take to get JS in?
2014-02-03 00:35:43	Espyo	instant
2014-02-03 00:35:52	Espyo	but it IS JS, in the end
2014-02-03 00:35:53	@PikFan	really?
2014-02-03 00:35:58	@PikFan	also, brb
2014-02-03 00:36:16	Espyo	plus it's not like the current script is small as it is http://www.pikminwiki.com/MediaWiki:Common.js
2014-02-03 00:44:23	Espyo	you're still typing btw
2014-02-03 00:50:48	@PikFan	huh?
2014-02-03 00:50:49	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-03 00:51:11	@PikFan	had some letters in the box, I guess
2014-02-03 00:51:17	Espyo	yep
2014-02-03 00:52:41	@PikFan	oh wow
2014-02-03 00:52:47	@PikFan	the names people come up with
2014-02-03 00:53:01	@PikFan	there's a user in #mwchat with the nick LOL_Shelby

2014-02-03 00:53:26	Espyo	hm
2014-02-03 00:54:38	@PikFan	oh, someone in #mwchat needs programming help
2014-02-03 00:55:10	 *	@PikFan looks at Espyo
2014-02-03 00:55:53	@PikFan	can you join #mwchat so you can help this person?

2014-02-03 00:56:13	Espyo	I mean, #mwchat is icky
2014-02-03 00:56:15	@PikFan	yeah, but
2014-02-03 00:56:28	@PikFan	I don't want to say "oh, join #pikipedia "
2014-02-03 00:56:35	@PikFan	because that's advertising
2014-02-03 00:56:45	@PikFan	...according to the brainless ops
2014-02-03 00:57:04	Espyo	all right, but I won't be sheepish
2014-02-03 00:57:06	Espyo	I'm going my way
2014-02-03 00:57:10	Espyo	and the ops better accept it
2014-02-03 00:57:17	@PikFan	okay
2014-02-03 00:57:31	Espyo	if there's rules that you must say "I AM A GOLDEN HAMSTER" when you join, they better not think I'm following them

2014-02-03 00:58:11	@PikFan	I just glitched

2014-02-03 00:58:18	@PikFan	ah, never mind
2014-02-03 00:58:21	Espyo	you brain glitched
2014-02-03 00:58:26	Espyo	anyway, you needed programming help?
2014-02-03 00:58:35	Espyo	I have some time, I can lend a hand
2014-02-03 01:00:15	Spark	alrighty so 
2014-02-03 01:00:39	Spark	i've got this code that's supposed to use openGL to just display a square
2014-02-03 01:00:48	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-03 01:00:57	Spark	im not getting any errors, but it just gives me a black window
2014-02-03 01:01:00	Espyo	oh boy, OpenGL... a lot of things can go wrong
2014-02-03 01:01:13	Espyo	I did OpenGL in college two years ago, and I don't remember anything
2014-02-03 01:01:21	Spark	oh
2014-02-03 01:01:23	Espyo	but my first guess would be that you're not flipping the buffer, if it's double-buffered
2014-02-03 01:01:33	Espyo	I can still help, no worries, just need to refresh my mind a bit
2014-02-03 01:01:42	Espyo	I'll check the example programs I did for college
2014-02-03 01:02:05	Spark	this is what i've got for the display code: http://mibpaste.com/d5YWl5 
2014-02-03 01:02:35	Espyo	woah shaders
2014-02-03 01:02:41	Espyo	which version of OpenGL is this?
2014-02-03 01:03:18	Spark	4
2014-02-03 01:03:51	Espyo	I think I programmed in 3...
2014-02-03 01:04:00	Espyo	let's see, at the end of the drawing routine on my little program here...
2014-02-03 01:04:06	Espyo	I call glFlush()
2014-02-03 01:04:14	Espyo	and then glutSwapBuffers()
2014-02-03 01:04:17	Espyo	oh, the latter requires glut
2014-02-03 01:04:23	Espyo	which is probably an OpenGL 3 thing
2014-02-03 01:04:26	Spark	im using glut
2014-02-03 01:04:30	Espyo	ah
2014-02-03 01:04:33	Spark	:p
2014-02-03 01:04:37	Espyo	all the better then
2014-02-03 01:05:25	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-03 01:05:39	Espyo	yeah, might really be because of a missing glFlush() and glutSwapBuffers
2014-02-03 01:05:58	Espyo	I program a lot on Allegro, which is a C++ 2D game library that work on top of OpenGL, but has its own functions
2014-02-03 01:06:10	Espyo	and when you draw something, you have to flip the display at the end
2014-02-03 01:06:17	Espyo	or else nothing gets drawn and you only get a black screen
2014-02-03 01:06:34	Espyo	alternately, the square you're drawing is colored black... don't suppose that's it, is it?
2014-02-03 01:07:05	Spark	nah 
2014-02-03 01:07:14	Spark	and i added it, nothing changed :(
2014-02-03 01:07:30	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-03 01:07:37	Espyo	do the square coordinates make sense?
2014-02-03 01:08:02	Espyo	I mean, are they like -1, -1 to 1, 1?
2014-02-03 01:08:12	Espyo	or 4000, 4000 to 5000, 5000?
2014-02-03 01:08:24	Espyo	don't be offended by the basic questions, as if I'm insulting you
2014-02-03 01:08:31	Spark	they're all between -1 and 1
2014-02-03 01:08:35	Espyo	it's just that if the basic doesn't even work, something basic has to be off :P
2014-02-03 01:08:48	Spark	and no offense taken, im pretty new to this :
2014-02-03 01:08:50	Spark	*:p
2014-02-03 01:08:53	Espyo	do you have FRAPS?
2014-02-03 01:09:01	Spark	no, i dont
2014-02-03 01:09:28	Espyo	hm
2014-02-03 01:09:46	Espyo	FRAPS also shows the framerate, so if the number is anything but 0, it would mean that OpenGL IS drawing
2014-02-03 01:10:51	Spark	its free, right?
2014-02-03 01:11:16	Espyo	well, for what we want, yeah
2014-02-03 01:11:24	Espyo	there's the free version, and the paid one
2014-02-03 01:11:32	Espyo	the free version caps video recordings to 30 seconds
2014-02-03 01:11:39	Espyo	but we only really need to check the framerate, so who cares
2014-02-03 01:12:51	Spark	*sigh* just my luck
2014-02-03 01:12:56	Spark	the fraps website is down -.-
2014-02-03 01:13:01	Espyo	nuts
2014-02-03 01:13:07	Espyo	should be an alternate download somewhere
2014-02-03 01:13:11	Espyo	any version works for this
2014-02-03 01:14:57	Espyo	PikFan: how weird, the Exploration Kit's treasures are missing from the treasure config file
2014-02-03 01:15:14	Espyo	and I think it's precisely the EK treasures that change weight to match the number of surviving Pikmin
2014-02-03 01:15:17	@PikFan	...what
2014-02-03 01:15:27	Espyo	gaaaah, the day Pikmin 2 ever makes sense...
2014-02-03 01:15:55	@PikFan	...the EK treasures change /weight/?
2014-02-03 01:16:05	Espyo	...yes?
2014-02-03 01:16:07	Espyo	you didn't know?
2014-02-03 01:16:08	@PikFan	is that even possible?
2014-02-03 01:16:12	Espyo	we know SOME treasures change weight
2014-02-03 01:16:19	Espyo	I thought you knew
2014-02-03 01:16:25	Espyo	me and Pikpikmate discussed it some days ago
2014-02-03 01:16:25	@PikFan	no, this is new
2014-02-03 01:16:32	Espyo	well, it makes sense
2014-02-03 01:16:51	Espyo	suppose you have a long battle against the Man-at-Legs
2014-02-03 01:16:58	Espyo	 4 of your Pikmin survive
2014-02-03 01:17:04	Espyo	you go get the Stellar Orb...
2014-02-03 01:17:08	Espyo	and you're one Pikmin short
2014-02-03 01:17:18	Espyo	congrats! you have to do the cave AND the fight all over again!
2014-02-03 01:17:34	Espyo	they decided that sucked, so it changes to 4
2014-02-03 01:17:43	@PikFan	bizzare
2014-02-03 01:19:12	Espyo	though we're not sure what treasures change weight because of that
2014-02-03 01:19:23	Espyo	supposedly it's any treasure that drops from a boss, but what if it isn't?
2014-02-03 01:19:29	Espyo	I decided to check the in-game files, but...
2014-02-03 01:19:37	Espyo	for SOME reason, the EK ones are missing from this file
2014-02-03 01:19:41	Espyo	which makes NO sense
2014-02-03 01:19:42	@PikFan	so what would happen if only 1 Pikmin survived?
2014-02-03 01:19:51	Espyo	it'd weigh 1
2014-02-03 01:19:57	Espyo	even if it was like a heavy thing
2014-02-03 01:20:01	@PikFan	that's so weird
2014-02-03 01:20:06	Espyo	but again, it makes sense
2014-02-03 01:20:10	Espyo	I'm glad they did that
2014-02-03 01:20:17	Espyo	you endured all the way through the fit
2014-02-03 01:20:23	Espyo	you already lost dozens of Pikmin
2014-02-03 01:20:30	@PikFan	too bad it causes a headache for programmers
2014-02-03 01:20:39	Espyo	it'd suck having to come out of that incredibly hardly-earned success only to be greeted with a punch to the face
2014-02-03 01:20:44	Espyo	it /shouldn't/
2014-02-03 01:20:51	Espyo	if they only organized their game files right...
2014-02-03 01:21:35	Espyo	this file has info for 188 treasures...
2014-02-03 01:21:47	Espyo	 13 treasures missing then...
2014-02-03 01:21:53	Espyo	EK plus... one more?
2014-02-03 01:21:56	@PikFan	brb
2014-02-03 01:21:59	@PikFan	I'
2014-02-03 01:22:01	@PikFan	gah
2014-02-03 01:22:08	@PikFan	*I'm going to try this
2014-02-03 01:22:41	Espyo	go ahead
2014-02-03 01:22:49	Espyo	more confirmation is always welcomed
2014-02-03 01:22:59	Espyo	I know the treasures change from memory, it happened with the Stellar Orb
2014-02-03 01:23:11	Espyo	...but now that I rechecked that it weighs 5 normally, maybe it was a false memory
2014-02-03 01:23:25	Espyo	but Pikpikmate tested it again after some other treasure changed for him
2014-02-03 01:23:30	Espyo	so he reconfirmed it
2014-02-03 01:23:33	Espyo	but try it yourself as well
2014-02-03 01:23:37	Espyo	Spark: you're still typing
2014-02-03 01:24:34	Spark	woohps
2014-02-03 01:27:25	Espyo	any luck with FRAPS?
2014-02-03 01:33:37	Spark	nope :(
2014-02-03 01:36:09	Espyo	how weird
2014-02-03 01:36:18	Espyo	try this: open task manager when you run
2014-02-03 01:36:21	Espyo	and tell me what your CPU usage is
2014-02-03 01:37:44	Spark	its changing constantly, but within the range of 30-70
2014-02-03 01:38:35	Espyo	hm, that doesn't sound right
2014-02-03 01:38:40	Espyo	are you drawing on a timer?
2014-02-03 01:38:50	Spark	nope
2014-02-03 01:38:55	Espyo	oh, that explains it then
2014-02-03 01:39:00	Spark	ill just paste what ive got
2014-02-03 01:39:05	Espyo	the usage, I mean
2014-02-03 01:39:08	Espyo	yeah, might as well
2014-02-03 01:39:24	Spark	http://mibpaste.com/jUDWia 
2014-02-03 01:39:28	Spark	thats the relevant code
2014-02-03 01:39:53	Spark	theres some other stuff but thats basically all that relates to it
2014-02-03 01:41:33	Espyo	ok, if you pass GLUT_DOUBLE to glutInitDisplayMode(), then that glutSwapBuffers() from before is REALLY needed
2014-02-03 01:41:38	Espyo	even though it didn't fix the problem, don't delete it
2014-02-03 01:42:54	Espyo	it's so weird that you're using shaders to color this simple square
2014-02-03 01:43:18	Spark	apparently in opengl4, everything is done with shaders :S
2014-02-03 01:44:07	Espyo	really? how weird
2014-02-03 01:44:17	Espyo	don't you have glColor3f()?
2014-02-03 01:44:24	Spark	nope
2014-02-03 01:44:29	Spark	should i
2014-02-03 01:44:32	Espyo	wow
2014-02-03 01:44:47	Espyo	maybe not; I used glColor3f() when I did my things, but again, it's OpenGL 3
2014-02-03 01:45:40	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-03 01:45:51	Espyo	yeah, some parts are a bit different from stuff I made
2014-02-03 01:45:58	Espyo	so I can't say for sure what the problem is
2014-02-03 01:46:07	Spark	ah
2014-02-03 01:46:15	Espyo	could be the square that isn't made out right, or it could be OpenGL that's not drawing
2014-02-03 01:46:33	Espyo	isn't there some code you can copy+paste online?
2014-02-03 01:46:59	Spark	this is mostly copypasted from a tutorial anyways
2014-02-03 01:47:12	Spark	http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/hellotriangle.html
2014-02-03 01:48:33	@PikFan	Espyo: it happened
2014-02-03 01:48:41	@PikFan	I went through the Shower Room
2014-02-03 01:48:54	@PikFan	killed the Ranging Bloyster with 1 Pikmin left
2014-02-03 01:49:18	@PikFan	and the Amplified Amplifier weighed only 1
2014-02-03 01:50:32	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-03 01:51:12	@PikFan	so, this makes me wonder
2014-02-03 01:51:26	@PikFan	if you bring in just 1 Pikmin to a cave
2014-02-03 01:51:30	@PikFan	will it weigh 1?
2014-02-03 01:51:37	Espyo	almost definitely
2014-02-03 01:51:43	Espyo	good luck beating a RB with 1 Pikmin thought
2014-02-03 01:51:44	Espyo	*though
2014-02-03 01:51:54	@PikFan	hehehe, yeah
2014-02-03 01:52:17	Espyo	hmm, I can't really see anything else wrong with the code...
2014-02-03 01:52:38	Espyo	is glfw something related to glut, a new library, ...?
2014-02-03 01:52:51	Spark	its some other library, im not using it
2014-02-03 01:52:59	Spark	which is why there are some differences
2014-02-03 01:53:29	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-03 01:54:19	Espyo	can glShaderSource or glCompileShader return anything?
2014-02-03 01:55:23	Spark	nope, they're voids
2014-02-03 01:56:38	Espyo	drat
2014-02-03 01:56:45	Espyo	could be a problem with the shader compilation
2014-02-03 01:57:10	Espyo	maybe glAttachShader?
2014-02-03 01:58:58	Spark	nope, also void
2014-02-03 01:59:20	Espyo	glLinkProgram...?
2014-02-03 01:59:58	Spark	same
2014-02-03 02:00:31	Espyo	good grief...
2014-02-03 02:00:46	Spark	ah well
2014-02-03 02:00:54	Spark	thanks for the help, anyways
2014-02-03 02:00:55	Espyo	is there anything that does return something?
2014-02-03 02:01:03	Spark	not really, no
2014-02-03 02:01:07	Espyo	if there is, it might return success or failure
2014-02-03 02:01:17	Espyo	how weird, I could swear loads of OpenGL functions returned success codes
2014-02-03 02:01:22	Espyo	maybe it's just a version 3 thing
2014-02-03 02:01:25	Espyo	well, keep trying
2014-02-03 02:01:33	Espyo	you got past the compilation stage
2014-02-03 02:01:37	Espyo	and trust me, that's by far the worst one
2014-02-03 02:01:45	Espyo	so there's no point in giving up now
2014-02-03 02:01:50	Espyo	good luck!
2014-02-03 02:01:55	Espyo	I'll be heading off to bed real soon anyway
2014-02-03 02:03:04	Spark	thanks
2014-02-03 02:03:22	Spark	and g'night
2014-02-03 02:03:46	Espyo	night
2014-02-03 02:04:35	Espyo	ok, it's the Exploration Kit + The Key
2014-02-03 02:04:43	Espyo	question now is... WHY aren't they on that file?
2014-02-03 02:05:00	Espyo	isn't there a boss that drops something not-EK+TK-related?
2014-02-03 02:05:02	@PikFan	maybe because of their special properties?
2014-02-03 02:05:16	@PikFan	the bosses in the WW
2014-02-03 02:05:19	Espyo	yeah, but this file contains data for common properties like weight, and max carriers
2014-02-03 02:05:27	Espyo	I was just thinking of those bosses as you said that
2014-02-03 02:06:23	@PikFan	heh
2014-02-03 02:06:34	Espyo	can you try one of those bosses?
2014-02-03 02:06:40	Espyo	see if the weight changes
2014-02-03 02:07:05	@PikFan	yeah, soon
2014-02-03 02:07:11	Espyo	carcass_config.txt... wonder what this is
2014-02-03 02:07:47	Espyo	exactly what it sounds like
2014-02-03 02:07:52	Espyo	carrying data for corpses
2014-02-03 02:07:55	Espyo	...and Olimar
2014-02-03 02:08:11	Espyo	oh, 1 weight unit in Pikmin 2, 4 Pikmin max
2014-02-03 02:09:49	Espyo	ah-ha!
2014-02-03 02:09:52	Espyo	they're in a different file
2014-02-03 02:09:56	Espyo	item_config.txt
2014-02-03 02:10:14	Espyo	seems like the same in every way, except with some parameters missing
2014-02-03 02:11:18	Espyo	scratch that, if anything, it has more parameters
2014-02-03 02:11:25	Espyo	like what message to display when it's found
2014-02-03 02:14:57	Espyo	well, going to bed
2014-02-03 02:14:59	Espyo	it's getting late
2014-02-03 02:15:11	Espyo	and I think I'll be having a rough night â€” my cat will be sleeping with me tonight
2014-02-03 02:16:31	@PikFan	okay

2014-02-04 18:57:52	@J	hmm, interesting
2014-02-04 18:57:59	Espyo	hmm?
2014-02-04 18:58:05	@J	the new hard drive arrived, and the label says 750GB
2014-02-04 18:58:09	@J	I ordered 500GB
2014-02-04 18:58:13	@J	everything else is the same
2014-02-04 18:58:39	Espyo	all the better, then
2014-02-04 18:58:47	@J	until I plug it in and check for sure
2014-02-04 18:58:53	Espyo	but maybe you should double-check on your maâ€”
2014-02-04 18:58:55	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-04 18:59:18	@J	if the label didn't match the drive I'd be worried, though
2014-02-04 18:59:24	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-04 19:00:28	@J	hmm, well, apparently I could've got it for practically the same price anyway, I just didn't notice
2014-02-04 19:01:04	Espyo	oh
2014-02-04 19:01:15	@J	but before the fun begins, I have to eat
2014-02-04 20:32:33	@J	...I got the command to set keyboard repeat rate mixed up and made it so high I struggled to type it in correctly
2014-02-04 20:32:43	@J	I did 250Hz instead of 60
2014-02-04 20:32:46	Espyo	haha
2014-02-04 20:32:52	@J	(250 is ms until start repeating)
2014-02-04 20:33:00	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-04 20:33:27	@J	of course, the maximum on Windows is 20Hz or something
2014-02-04 20:33:43	Espyo	yeah, it's something like that
2014-02-04 20:52:13	@J	first 2 letters typed match against the start of a filename, more than 2 are searched within filenames - why can't other file managers be this smart?
2014-02-04 20:52:19	@J	it's such an easy thing to do, to
2014-02-04 20:52:34	@J	even always searching would be better than just matching against the start

2014-02-04 21:03:21	Espyo	and it's pretty sexy as well
2014-02-04 21:03:39	Espyo	something tells me they tried always searching first, though
2014-02-04 21:03:50	Espyo	but realized that that doesn't always end well
2014-02-04 21:12:29	@J	hah, you got it
2014-02-04 21:12:46	@J	yeah, it was like that for a while, then changed recently
2014-02-04 21:13:38	@J	also, I might take a while to reply because I'm not getting notifications on other workspaces (using a live CD thing while copying stuff)
2014-02-04 21:14:05	@J	wait, try saying something
2014-02-04 21:19:17	Espyo	right
2014-02-04 21:19:24	Espyo	I was dining, hence the delay
2014-02-04 21:19:28	Espyo	third message goes here
2014-02-04 21:23:41	@J	hmm, nothing
2014-02-04 21:26:10	@J	meh
2014-02-04 21:26:20	@J	okay, so as I've said, I'm running a live CD
2014-02-04 21:26:31	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-04 21:26:38	@J	since I booted it, I've installed a number of programs, and not lightweight ones
2014-02-04 21:26:45	@J	VLC, Firefox, GParted
2014-02-04 21:26:50	@J	some others...
2014-02-04 21:27:35	@J	TrueCrypt, ddrescue, Vim
2014-02-04 21:27:49	@J	and I'm currently running most of them
2014-02-04 21:28:06	Spark	you guys talk about lots of computer-y stuff here for a pikmin wiki chat
2014-02-04 21:28:08	@J	but I can't work out where the files are being stored
2014-02-04 21:28:12	@J	...maybe
2014-02-04 21:28:18	Espyo	hehe, just me and him, mostly
2014-02-04 21:28:26	@J	I mean, there's no other place they could be other than in memory
2014-02-04 21:28:30	Espyo	uh... I can't really recall
2014-02-04 21:28:34	Espyo	but I think it's in memory, yeah
2014-02-04 21:28:37	@J	but total memory usage is only 300MiB
2014-02-04 21:28:45	Espyo	swap partition=
2014-02-04 21:28:46	Espyo	*?
2014-02-04 21:28:54	@J	like I said, live CD
2014-02-04 21:29:09	@J	if I had a swap partition, it'd have to be on a disk, and the OS would have to know about it
2014-02-04 21:29:15	Espyo	ugh, of course
2014-02-04 21:29:20	Espyo	stupid remark
2014-02-04 21:29:29	Espyo	dunno what I was thinking
2014-02-04 21:29:43	Espyo	is it an actual CD?
2014-02-04 21:29:48	@J	DVD
2014-02-04 21:30:04	Espyo	eh, even if it isn't, you have to specifically enable file-saving on the Live CD media when you burn it
2014-02-04 21:30:08	@J	yeah, if it were a USB drive it could use that, I guess
2014-02-04 21:30:42	@J	I guess it's possible it's not reported as part of the memory in use
2014-02-04 21:31:35	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-04 21:39:58	@J	okay, 20/500GiB done, in one direction
2014-02-04 21:40:02	@J	...this may take a few days
2014-02-04 21:40:17	Espyo	yeah..
2014-02-04 21:40:18	Espyo	*.
2014-02-04 22:15:22	Spark	oh hell yeah 
2014-02-04 22:15:42	Spark	after some rad pro debugging i've found out that it wasnt my shitty programming after all, it was my outdated computer!
2014-02-04 22:17:21	Espyo	heh
2014-02-04 22:17:25	Espyo	still the same problem with the square?
2014-02-04 22:18:09	Spark	yeah
2014-02-04 22:18:15	Spark	but now i can fix it at least
2014-02-04 22:18:22	Espyo	yeah...
2014-02-04 22:33:09	@J	whaaaaaaaaaat
2014-02-04 22:33:29	@J	I accidentally scrolled using just the laptop touch pad thing
2014-02-04 22:33:42	@J	some testing shows it's 2-finger scrolling
2014-02-04 22:33:52	@J	I didn't even know this touchpad had multi-touch support
2014-02-04 22:34:07	@J	nothing has ever hinted at that being a thing before
2014-02-04 22:35:47	Espyo	yeah, mine's 2-finger as well
2014-02-04 22:36:00	Espyo	the software that came with it allowed me to configure the gestures and such
2014-02-04 22:36:04	Espyo	that's how I found out
2014-02-04 22:36:13	Espyo	it should have two fingers left/right as well
2014-02-04 22:36:22	Espyo	I mean, mapped to horizontal scrolling

2014-02-06 01:30:04	@PikFan	deleted
2014-02-06 01:30:13	@PikFan	that's what you needed me for, yes?
2014-02-06 01:30:21	TehPehEhm	Yep
2014-02-06 01:30:29	Spark	psst espyo what's the point of the "this" keyword
2014-02-06 01:30:38	Espyo	you know about classes?
2014-02-06 01:30:53	Spark	yeah
2014-02-06 01:31:14	Espyo	well, it's mostly when you have stuff like setHealth(float health) on a class
2014-02-06 01:31:18	Espyo	and then you have health = health inside
2014-02-06 01:31:29	Espyo	but, how is C++ supposed to know which one is the health on the function, and which one is the health on the class?
2014-02-06 01:31:44	Espyo	you use this->health to indicate that it's the health attribute belonging to this class
2014-02-06 01:31:59	Espyo	more correctly, "this" is a pointer to the current instance of a class
2014-02-06 01:32:00	Spark	but i dont see how class::var is different from this.var
2014-02-06 01:32:11	Espyo	not quite sure if the former works
2014-02-06 01:32:13	@PikFan	TehPehEhm: anything else you need?
2014-02-06 01:32:27	Spark	like, if its a function in class, then doesnt it already assume it's the var in that class?
2014-02-06 01:32:27	Espyo	also the latter is meant to be this->var, not this.var, but meh
2014-02-06 01:32:50	Spark	i mean like
2014-02-06 01:32:59	Spark	this is all in a constructor, in my case
2014-02-06 01:33:22	Spark	so doesnt it just assume all variables are in that instance of the class, anyways?
2014-02-06 01:34:04	Espyo	it does
2014-02-06 01:34:10	Espyo	but it's only helpful to avoid ambiguity
2014-02-06 01:34:22	Espyo	if you declare a variable called var somewhere in your constructor
2014-02-06 01:34:22	Spark	alright
2014-02-06 01:34:35	Espyo	C++ will no longer know if it's your local var or if it's the class' instance's var
2014-02-06 01:35:04	Spark	so if in the class's "public" section i have
2014-02-06 01:35:05	Spark	unsigned int shader_program, vs, fs;
2014-02-06 01:35:22	Spark	then     glCompileShader (vs); should work, right?
2014-02-06 01:35:28	TehPehEhm	Oh, I didn't see your message PikFan
2014-02-06 01:35:37	Espyo	yep
2014-02-06 01:35:38	TehPehEhm	I don't think there is really anything else
2014-02-06 01:35:44	@PikFan	okay
2014-02-06 01:35:44	Espyo	no need for this->vs in this case
2014-02-06 01:35:50	Spark	hm
2014-02-06 01:35:52	TehPehEhm	I am going for Master Flower rank
2014-02-06 01:35:52	Spark	okay thanks
2014-02-06 01:35:58	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-06 01:36:05	@PikFan	good luck with that!
2014-02-06 01:36:07	TehPehEhm	And I finally finished my first game
2014-02-06 01:36:09	TehPehEhm	Thanks
2014-02-06 01:36:16	@PikFan	congrats
2014-02-06 01:36:44	TehPehEhm	And also there was a new chapter in my fanfiction
2014-02-06 01:36:54	TehPehEhm	In my opinion, it's my favorite one
2014-02-06 01:37:06	@PikFan	oh, nice
2014-02-06 01:37:10	@PikFan	could you link it?

2014-02-06 01:38:16	TehPehEhm	Darn you Sagittarius...
2014-02-06 01:39:47	TehPehEhm	Actually I realized that where it says 'Olimar's POV' and 'Libra's POV', it isn't really their point of view
2014-02-06 01:39:55	TehPehEhm	It is third person
2014-02-06 01:40:12	@PikFan	heh
2014-02-06 01:40:25	TehPehEhm	I'm going to fix that in a bit
2014-02-06 01:41:17	TehPehEhm	Sagittarius, how could you?
2014-02-06 01:41:36	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-06 01:41:38	TehPehEhm	Bang Bang
2014-02-06 01:41:46	TehPehEhm	But then... Cliffhanger
2014-02-06 01:41:47	@PikFan	you might want to capitalize some things though
2014-02-06 01:42:06	TehPehEhm	Such as?
2014-02-06 01:42:11	@PikFan	Pikmin
2014-02-06 01:42:26	@PikFan	I'm seeing a lot of Pikmin left uncapitalized
2014-02-06 01:42:38	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-02-06 01:42:48	TehPehEhm	I didn't think it 
2014-02-06 01:42:54	@PikFan	heh
2014-02-06 01:42:56	TehPehEhm	I didn't think it should've been
2014-02-06 01:43:17	@PikFan	"Pikmin" is a proper noun, so it should always be capitalized
2014-02-06 01:43:34	TehPehEhm	But when you think of it
2014-02-06 01:43:41	TehPehEhm	It's a group of pikmin
2014-02-06 01:43:45	TehPehEhm	So it is common
2014-02-06 01:43:57	@PikFan	mm...
2014-02-06 01:44:06	TehPehEhm	Now, if it was specific, such as a Red Pikmin, it would be a proper noun
2014-02-06 01:44:09	@PikFan	they're still proper
2014-02-06 01:44:32	@PikFan	even in a group, you'd still call it a group of Pikmin
2014-02-06 01:45:00	TehPehEhm	Hmm
2014-02-06 01:45:13	@PikFan	even though the singular and plural are the same (Pikmin), it should always be capitalized
2014-02-06 01:45:27	TehPehEhm	I see
2014-02-06 01:46:11	@PikFan	simple rules of grammar ;)
2014-02-06 01:46:25	TehPehEhm	True
2014-02-06 01:46:33	TehPehEhm	I didn't really think of that much
2014-02-06 01:46:43	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-06 01:46:58	TehPehEhm	Well ill probably fix that stuff tomorrow
2014-02-06 01:47:05	TehPehEhm	Since I'll be watching tv at 9
2014-02-06 01:47:20	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-06 01:47:27	@PikFan	it's almost 9 for you, isn't it?
2014-02-06 01:47:34	TehPehEhm	 8:47
2014-02-06 01:47:43	@PikFan	5:47
2014-02-06 01:48:38	TehPehEhm	So that would be...
2014-02-06 01:48:46	TehPehEhm	 9 hours ahead
2014-02-06 01:48:52	@PikFan	...no
2014-02-06 01:48:56	@PikFan	3 hours ahead
2014-02-06 01:49:07	TehPehEhm	Wait...
2014-02-06 01:49:17	TehPehEhm	It's 5:47 PM for you?
2014-02-06 01:49:23	@PikFan	mhm
2014-02-06 01:49:31	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-02-06 01:49:41	TehPehEhm	I thought PM
2014-02-06 01:49:47	TehPehEhm	So 3 hours behind
2014-02-06 01:49:55	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-06 01:50:02	@PikFan	time zones are tricky :P
2014-02-06 01:50:21	TehPehEhm	I know
2014-02-06 01:51:40	@PikFan	oh, also
2014-02-06 01:51:47	@PikFan	have you seen my Pikmin counts?
2014-02-06 01:51:47	Spark	okay opengl is legitimately broken this isnt even my fault anymore
2014-02-06 01:51:52	TehPehEhm	Yes
2014-02-06 01:52:03	TehPehEhm	They are really big
2014-02-06 01:52:08	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-06 01:52:29	@PikFan	I found a way to make over a thousand Pikmin in a day
2014-02-06 01:52:37	TehPehEhm	Ooh
2014-02-06 01:52:41	@PikFan	but it's just
2014-02-06 01:52:43	@PikFan	spo
2014-02-06 01:52:45	TehPehEhm	That would be helpful for my friend
2014-02-06 01:52:45	Spark	pikmin?
2014-02-06 01:52:46	@PikFan	*so
2014-02-06 01:52:47	Spark	pfff
2014-02-06 01:52:51	@PikFan	repetitive
2014-02-06 01:53:03	Spark	pikmin are sooo 2013, cookies are where it's at
2014-02-06 01:53:06	TehPehEhm	how do you do it?
2014-02-06 01:53:11	@PikFan	Cookie Clicker?
2014-02-06 01:53:17	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-06 01:53:22	@PikFan	got 173 quad
2014-02-06 01:53:25	@PikFan	in the bank
2014-02-06 01:53:28	Spark	cookie /life/
2014-02-06 01:53:45	@PikFan	TehPehEhm: well, you need to have the Wistful Wild unlocked
2014-02-06 01:53:50	TehPehEhm	I have about 20 billion
2014-02-06 01:53:57	TehPehEhm	*trillion
2014-02-06 01:54:00	TehPehEhm	I do
2014-02-06 01:54:25	@PikFan	then just bring a few Purple Pikmin, and another Pikmin type of your choice
2014-02-06 01:54:32	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-06 01:54:40	@PikFan	the cave you go to is the Cavern of Chaos
2014-02-06 01:54:44	TehPehEhm	Ok
2014-02-06 01:54:57	@PikFan	on sublevels 4 and 5, there are Queen Candypop Buds
2014-02-06 01:55:26	@PikFan	so the key to getting lots of Pikmin is going to the Cavern of Chaos over and over and over again
2014-02-06 01:55:37	@PikFan	and using the Queen Candypops
2014-02-06 01:55:41	TehPehEhm	I'll tell my friend about that
2014-02-06 01:55:56	@PikFan	but it's just a very repetitive task
2014-02-06 01:56:18	@PikFan	so far, I've gotten about... 900 Pikmin?
2014-02-06 01:56:21	TehPehEhm	I might try it once and log it in my online journal page that I made
2014-02-06 01:56:24	@PikFan	and I'm not done yet
2014-02-06 01:56:52	TehPehEhm	I've only beaten... Hmm, I don't even remember
2014-02-06 01:56:58	TehPehEhm	I believe 2 days
2014-02-06 01:57:07	TehPehEhm	In pikmin 3
2014-02-06 01:57:29	@PikFan	you're only on day 3 in Pikmin 3?
2014-02-06 01:57:40	TehPehEhm	On my journal
2014-02-06 01:57:43	TehPehEhm	Yes
2014-02-06 01:57:46	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-06 01:57:58	TehPehEhm	I haven't been updating it much

2014-02-07 22:18:06	@PikFan	it's snowing out

2014-02-07 22:20:36	@PikFan	don't know how much exactly, but I'd say there's about 6 inches
2014-02-07 22:20:36	Testyo	6 inches = 15.24 cm

2014-02-07 22:23:55	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-07 22:35:13	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2014-02-07 22:35:24	@PikFan	a few nights ago I achieved 1 trillion cps
2014-02-07 22:36:52	@PikFan	let's see... right now my cps 1,126,533,496,073.4
2014-02-07 22:37:41	Espyo	hmmmm
2014-02-07 22:45:12	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-07 22:45:21	@PikFan	did you see my question on the engine page?
2014-02-07 22:45:28	Espyo	I did, I replied
2014-02-07 22:45:30	Espyo	...didn't I?
2014-02-07 22:45:33	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-07 22:46:08	@PikFan	"changes in perspective will certainly be impossible"
2014-02-07 22:46:13	@PikFan	rats
2014-02-07 22:46:32	Espyo	of course, it'd only work if it were 3D
2014-02-07 22:47:02	@PikFan	but I thought that it /is/ 3D
2014-02-07 22:47:09	@PikFan	i.e. the world
2014-02-07 22:47:21	@PikFan	or is it all flat
2014-02-07 22:47:34	Espyo	it's...
2014-02-07 22:47:36	Espyo	complicated
2014-02-07 22:47:48	Espyo	"2D" and "3D" don't have a concrete definition
2014-02-07 22:47:53	Espyo	well, they do, but they dont
2014-02-07 22:47:56	Espyo	*don't
2014-02-07 22:48:00	Espyo	geez, apostrophe
2014-02-07 22:48:06	@PikFan	hehe
2014-02-07 22:48:30	Espyo	anyway, the game screen is 2D
2014-02-07 22:48:37	Espyo	the "world" is kinda 3D
2014-02-07 22:48:46	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-07 22:48:51	Espyo	you have 2D, as seen from above, but you also have height
2014-02-07 22:48:57	Espyo	I mean, you can throw your Pikmin up, and such
2014-02-07 22:49:12	@PikFan	is it like looking up in Pikmin 2?
2014-02-07 22:49:21	Espyo	looking from above, you mean, yeah
2014-02-07 22:49:23	Espyo	and in Pikmin
2014-02-07 22:49:28	Espyo	in terms of world, it's the same
2014-02-07 22:49:40	Espyo	but in terms of drawing, it has a 2D screen, and it just draws stuff in 2D
2014-02-07 22:49:46	Espyo	it effectively ignores "height"
2014-02-07 22:49:56	Espyo	only stuff like the shadows actually provide some sort of 3D "feel"
2014-02-07 22:49:57	@PikFan	well yeah, of course the screen's 2D
2014-02-07 22:50:05	@PikFan	can't see how it would be 3D
2014-02-07 22:50:16	Espyo	I could change the actual way the world is rendered to 3D
2014-02-07 22:50:22	Espyo	but Allegro is a 2D game library
2014-02-07 22:50:27	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-07 22:50:27	Espyo	so I'd have to use pure OpenGL
2014-02-07 22:50:33	Espyo	which would be tens of times harder
2014-02-07 22:50:47	@PikFan	if only you had J to help you
2014-02-07 22:50:51	Espyo	plus, there's the other problem I detailed on the Details section of the forum thread
2014-02-07 22:50:57	Espyo	pfft, J knows less about OpenGL than I do
2014-02-07 22:51:00	Espyo	no offence
2014-02-07 22:51:08	Espyo	at least, afaik
2014-02-07 22:51:32	Espyo	anyway, the world would have to be in models
2014-02-07 22:51:39	Espyo	which would increase the complexity of making contents by a LOT
2014-02-07 22:51:45	Espyo	for the game makers
2014-02-07 22:51:59	Espyo	at this point, people might as well make their own game from scratch
2014-02-07 22:52:03	@PikFan	so, what you're saying is, since Allegro is a 2D game library, you don't have a choice but to view games from above?
2014-02-07 22:52:04	Espyo	so 3D is really impossible
2014-02-07 22:52:15	Espyo	I can have stuff like a 2D platformer, viewed from the side
2014-02-07 22:52:23	Espyo	but 3D isn't really a thing with Allegro
2014-02-07 22:52:30	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-07 22:53:16	Espyo	in other words
2014-02-07 22:53:20	Espyo	Allegro does graphics with X and Y
2014-02-07 22:53:21	Espyo	no Z
2014-02-07 22:53:27	Espyo	yet the world is saved whichever way I want
2014-02-07 22:53:31	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-07 22:53:37	Espyo	and the game world is saved with X Y and Z
2014-02-07 22:53:43	Espyo	but I have no choice but to not do anything with Z
2014-02-07 22:53:53	Espyo	the best I can do is add some shadows to show that that ledge actually goes up, instead of down
2014-02-07 22:54:09	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-07 22:54:12	Espyo	also some other tricks, like zooming stuff that's "closer to the screen"
2014-02-07 22:54:24	Espyo	but actual 3D, with perspectives, is impossible
2014-02-07 22:54:32	Espyo	Allegro works on top of OpenGL, which does 3D, but
2014-02-07 22:54:45	Espyo	to actually use OpenGL's 3D stuff, I'd have to almost entirely ignore Allegro
2014-02-07 22:54:50	Espyo	and work with a much harder library
2014-02-07 22:55:03	@PikFan	mmm
2014-02-07 22:55:37	Espyo	so insanely harder to program + insanely harder to make graphics (sprites vs 3D models) = impossible
2014-02-07 22:55:52	Espyo	it's a fangame, after all
2014-02-07 22:56:00	Espyo	a project in my free time
2014-02-07 22:56:03	Espyo	not an actual full game
2014-02-07 22:56:10	Espyo	...engine
2014-02-07 22:56:19	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-07 22:59:32	Sick01|torchlight	you should use SFML
2014-02-07 22:59:49	Sick01|torchlight	it's pretty easy and iirc it has 3d
2014-02-07 22:59:59	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-07 23:00:05	Espyo	I see
2014-02-07 23:00:32	Espyo	that's pretty snazzy
2014-02-07 23:00:38	Espyo	tbh, I could still use Allegro with OpenGL
2014-02-07 23:00:45	Espyo	and audio, input, etc. would still work
2014-02-07 23:01:00	Sick01|torchlight	opengl is shit
2014-02-07 23:01:02	Espyo	it's just I'd have to do the 3D, which is not really easy
2014-02-07 23:01:11	Sick01|torchlight	im still mad at it for not working for no reason :(
2014-02-07 23:01:16	Espyo	hehe
2014-02-07 23:01:20	Espyo	welcome to programming, friend
2014-02-07 23:01:28	Espyo	where everything goes wrong and nobody knows anything
2014-02-07 23:01:35	Sick01|torchlight	i was convinced it was my programming at first but im pretty sure its actually just bugged
2014-02-07 23:02:07	Espyo	wouldn't deny that
2014-02-07 23:02:13	Espyo	even Allegro can fail because of this or that
2014-02-07 23:02:23	Espyo	it's never easy, SPECIALLY with C++
2014-02-07 23:02:34	Espyo	I've been programming on C++ for over 6 years now
2014-02-07 23:02:39	Espyo	and I still get shanked almost weekly
2014-02-07 23:02:48	Sick01|torchlight	:(
2014-02-07 23:02:51	Espyo	then again, visual studio is the worst IDE
2014-02-07 23:03:12	Espyo	though the whole thing also makes me like C++ all the better
2014-02-07 23:03:26	Sick01|torchlight	code blocks is pretty good
2014-02-07 23:03:26	Espyo	with great power comes great responsibility <â€” so true for C++
2014-02-07 23:03:36	Espyo	so I heard, but I never got it to compile with Allegro
2014-02-07 23:03:38	Sick01|torchlight	i mean, i think it is, ive never used anything else buuut
2014-02-07 23:05:11	Sick01|torchlight	oh dangit looks like SFML doesnt have 3d
2014-02-07 23:05:35	Espyo	aww
2014-02-07 23:21:19	@J	...I was about to say that, then I realised I'm 15 minutes too late
2014-02-07 23:21:46	@J	but yeah, if you do 3D, it does usually make sense to use SDL or SFML for Windowing and stuff

2014-02-07 23:53:47	Los_Plagas	Anyway, I was really lazy about that and didn't do much with it
2014-02-07 23:53:58	Los_Plagas	And, a few days ago, I felt guilty and started to go on and make a post
2014-02-07 23:54:06	Los_Plagas	But here's another limitation of the rights Revan gave me"
2014-02-07 23:54:15	Los_Plagas	I can't make a post!
2014-02-07 23:54:44	Espyo	...
2014-02-07 23:54:45	Los_Plagas	After some careful examination of Facebook's help page, I found that you have to be a high-level admin
2014-02-07 23:54:51	Los_Plagas	To make a post
2014-02-07 23:54:55	Los_Plagas	So it's not my incompetence
2014-02-07 23:55:06	Los_Plagas	Revan literally gave me a position that does not allow me to make a post.
2014-02-07 23:55:08	Espyo	on purpose, or did he just give you a ranking without even caring?
2014-02-07 23:55:15	Los_Plagas	Probably the latter
2014-02-07 23:55:22	Los_Plagas	Revan sounds like a lot of people I know
2014-02-07 23:55:31	Los_Plagas	Good-natured, but a bit clueless without specific direction
2014-02-07 23:55:50	Los_Plagas	He was probably wanted to stay the boss for some reason

2014-02-07 23:57:27	Espyo	right
2014-02-07 23:57:40	Espyo	gotta ask him again, and maybe this time, make everything clear
2014-02-07 23:57:52	Los_Plagas	Yes, I should
2014-02-07 23:58:19	Los_Plagas	I wish I could just message him someway other than Twitter, while still being sure I'll get a reply
2014-02-07 23:58:37	Los_Plagas	Twitter's 120 character limit makes things so much harder
2014-02-07 23:58:45	Espyo	yeah...
2014-02-07 23:58:50	Espyo	doesn't Twitter allow PMs of any sort?
2014-02-07 23:59:05	Los_Plagas	I don't believe so, though I will check
2014-02-07 23:59:15	Los_Plagas	I chose the option that seemed the most likely: "Message"
2014-02-07 23:59:38	Los_Plagas	But it turns out what that means is that you're basically making a regular post on their page
2014-02-07 23:59:51	Espyo	right
2014-02-08 00:00:12	Los_Plagas	However, I didn't look very hard
2014-02-08 00:00:18	Los_Plagas	I'll check
2014-02-08 00:00:24	Los_Plagas	Hopefully I can make things clear this time
2014-02-08 00:08:20	Los_Plagas	Meh, I just took the super-easy way out and strung lots of posts together.
2014-02-08 00:08:40	Los_Plagas	Let me keep proper grammar and everything, though I certainly hope he's willing to read it all.
2014-02-08 00:08:46	Espyo	hehe, yeah
2014-02-08 00:14:29	Los_Plagas	Maybe /then/ I can finally get the Facebook page up and running
2014-02-08 00:14:34	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-08 00:14:48	Los_Plagas	We could use some new users, I suppose
2014-02-08 00:14:57	Espyo	yeah, plus with the engine
2014-02-08 00:15:06	Espyo	new life might come to the community in the near future
2014-02-08 00:15:43	Los_Plagas	It'd be at just the right time, too
2014-02-08 00:15:56	Los_Plagas	If they're actual Pikmin fans, they'd help
2014-02-08 00:15:56	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-08 00:16:05	Los_Plagas	And if they're actual Pikmin fans with /money/ . . .
2014-02-08 00:16:11	Espyo	well, for the ones who feel comfortable with editing stuff
2014-02-08 00:16:11	Los_Plagas	Then they'd probably have Pikmin 3
2014-02-08 00:16:58	Los_Plagas	I suppose
2014-02-08 00:17:19	Los_Plagas	At any rate, we could use lots of Pikmin 3 work, though our focus is still the game's files

2014-02-08 14:42:53	@J	daaaaaaaaaa
2014-02-08 14:43:14	@J	do you remember a while back how I was complaining about libnotify segfaulting when trying to connect to the closed signal
2014-02-08 14:43:15	@J	?
2014-02-08 14:43:44	@J	well, I happened across the code today and ended up doing some fiddling
2014-02-08 14:43:57	@J	turns out it works if you show the notification first
2014-02-08 14:44:07	@J	which is weird and annoying
2014-02-08 14:44:12	@J	but means I can actually do this
2014-02-08 14:44:48	@J	okay, it was 5th June, and I only said 3 lines about it, so you probably don't remember
2014-02-08 14:44:55	Spark	segfaults are the most annoying thing ever
2014-02-08 14:45:01	Spark	im new to programming but ive already picked up on this

2014-02-08 17:32:38	Espyo	J, gravity
2014-02-08 17:32:58	Espyo	I want the Pikmin to be thrown ~7 Pikmin heights, and I want the throw to last 1 second
2014-02-08 17:33:10	Espyo	gravity = upward throw force = 2 seconds
2014-02-08 17:33:23	Espyo	and by fiddling with the value, I can make them go higher or lower
2014-02-08 17:33:30	Espyo	less upward force = less throwing time
2014-02-08 17:33:34	Espyo	...but also less height
2014-02-08 17:33:37	Espyo	wait
2014-02-08 17:33:47	Espyo	increase both, but keep the force half the gravity
2014-02-08 17:33:50	Espyo	that's it!
2014-02-08 17:33:50	Espyo	thanks
2014-02-08 17:33:55	@J	no problem
2014-02-08 17:35:02	@J	oh, and rather than it being weird behaviour, it turns out I just didn't understand pointers and NULL
2014-02-08 17:35:14	Espyo	that's the thing with pointers
2014-02-08 17:35:20	Espyo	you really /really/ have to understand what's up
2014-02-08 17:35:28	Espyo	or else you're just making your own doom
2014-02-08 17:35:37	Espyo	...Doom did use pointers, but that's not what I meant
2014-02-08 17:36:26	@J	I was trying to set the value pointed to by the NULL pointer
2014-02-08 17:36:54	@J	and I was comparing the value to NULL, rather than the pointer
2014-02-08 17:37:12	Espyo	heh, I see
2014-02-08 17:40:45	Espyo	yikes this looks wrong
2014-02-08 17:42:23	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/hmm.gif
2014-02-08 17:42:55	@J	!
2014-02-08 17:43:31	@J	the actual physics looks reasonable, though
2014-02-08 17:43:48	Espyo	except both the gravity and Olimar's arm are brutally strong
2014-02-08 17:44:01	Espyo	but there's just no other way to have throws that last a second
2014-02-08 17:44:36	@J	except all your numbers are relative
2014-02-08 17:44:43	@J	so they're not strong
2014-02-08 17:44:59	Espyo	they're /kinda/ relative
2014-02-08 17:45:14	Espyo	my speed actually works in distance per second
2014-02-08 17:45:24	Espyo	so at leas the time unit isn't arbitrary
2014-02-08 17:45:35	Espyo	it's pixels per second
2014-02-08 17:45:42	Espyo	and each pixel is... well, I'll calculate later
2014-02-08 17:46:05	@J	pixels in the debug side view?
2014-02-08 17:46:14	Espyo	it's to scale, so yeah
2014-02-08 17:46:26	Espyo	X, Y or Z speed are all pixels per second
2014-02-08 17:46:50	Espyo	ok, actually throwing Pikmin around feels good
2014-02-08 17:46:52	@J	I would guess 1500px/m, then
2014-02-08 17:47:00	Espyo	it's just the chart that looks super off
2014-02-08 17:47:15	Espyo	upwards throw strength is 1160 px/m
2014-02-08 17:47:27	Espyo	gravity is 2320 px/m^2
2014-02-08 17:47:35	Espyo	uh
2014-02-08 17:47:37	Espyo	px/s
2014-02-08 17:47:38	@J	you mean s?
2014-02-08 17:47:39	@J	yeah
2014-02-08 17:47:39	Espyo	you lead me into error
2014-02-08 17:48:13	@J	so gravity is ~6.5 times weaker than on earth
2014-02-08 17:48:40	Espyo	but a pixel isn't a meter
2014-02-08 17:48:46	@J	[17:46:52] @J I would guess 1500px/m, then
2014-02-08 17:48:54	Espyo	oh, that's what you meant
2014-02-08 17:49:01	@J	yeah
2014-02-08 17:49:09	@J	unlike some people, I wouldn't type crazy units
2014-02-08 17:49:18	Espyo	the way I'm thinking is if Olimar were a normal human
2014-02-08 17:49:22	Espyo	so not uh...
2014-02-08 17:49:25	Espyo	 1.9cm
2014-02-08 17:49:25	Testyo	1.9 cm = 0.74822 in / 0.06232 ft / 1 Olimar-heights / 3.1654 TRY-heights
2014-02-08 17:49:30	@J	hmm
2014-02-08 17:49:31	Espyo	many thanks, Testyo
2014-02-08 17:49:42	Espyo	for tiny Olimar, yeah, that strength is tiny
2014-02-08 17:49:46	@J	I thought Pikmin were 2cm (...okay, guessed)
2014-02-08 17:49:46	Testyo	2 cm = 0.7876 in / 0.0656 ft / 1.05263 Olimar-heights / 3.332 TRY-heights
2014-02-08 17:49:59	Espyo	the way I'm counting doesn't count the stem
2014-02-08 17:51:30	@J	well, it all depends on how much Pikmin weigh
2014-02-08 17:51:43	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-08 17:51:46	Espyo	forgot about that part
2014-02-08 17:51:54	@J	but yeah, easily throwing something almost your size to about 5 times your height makes you quite strong
2014-02-08 17:52:10	@J	uh, in normal gravity, anyway
2014-02-08 17:52:15	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-08 17:52:22	Espyo	plus, there's captain-throwing in Pikmin 3
2014-02-08 17:52:23	@J	but everything is wrong because your gravity doesn't match earth's
2014-02-08 17:52:26	Espyo	now /that/'s just insane
2014-02-08 17:52:45	@J	maybe it's a mechanical spacesuit
2014-02-08 17:53:54	Espyo	right
2014-02-08 17:59:46	Espyo	well, it may look wrong on the chart thing
2014-02-08 17:59:58	Espyo	but there's another thing â€” it's not actually a second in Pikmin 2
2014-02-08 18:00:02	Espyo	it's 1.3 seconds
2014-02-08 18:00:03	Espyo	or so
2014-02-08 18:21:27	Espyo	ok, now that I changed it to match 1.3 seconds, it looks a lot better
2014-02-08 19:16:36	@J	okay, and now the battery notification changes to reflect battery level changes
2014-02-08 19:16:57	Espyo	as it should

2014-02-08 21:04:16	@J	okay, so the projects I'd like to make are: that website change detection thing as RSS feed we discussed; a note-taking application that isn't worse than just using some text files; the YouTube subscriptions as RSS feed server thing we discussed; and a feed reader (I've tried quite a few, but the only one I can bear is Brief, and I would prefer something standalone and with some power tools)
2014-02-08 21:04:22	@J	 /long
2014-02-08 21:04:51	Espyo	http://daviddeutsch.github.io/yt-sanegrid/
2014-02-08 21:05:01	Espyo	I've been using that recently
2014-02-08 21:05:13	Espyo	it's not RSS, but it works for what I want
2014-02-08 21:05:17	@J	the page doesn't load
2014-02-08 21:05:23	Espyo	...
2014-02-08 21:05:27	@J	or, I mean, it's just blank
2014-02-08 21:05:33	Espyo	loading fine for mâ€” yeah
2014-02-08 21:05:47	@J	ah, you have to enable cookies
2014-02-08 21:05:52	@J	it's well-written, then
2014-02-08 21:07:24	@J	yeah, multiple reasons this won't work for me
2014-02-08 21:07:33	@J	1. it clearly only works if your subscriptions are public
2014-02-08 21:07:59	@J	2. it works off your subscriptions, so you can't subscribe to a playlist, or videos filtered by a regex, etc.
2014-02-08 21:08:38	Espyo	right
2014-02-08 21:08:54	Espyo	I actually made a quick greasemonkey script to filter with regex
2014-02-08 21:08:59	@J	also, it's trying to do multiple things: give you a sane list of videos plus implement a feed reader UI
2014-02-08 21:09:06	Espyo	but dropped it in favor of this, and never bothered to do anything with it again
2014-02-08 21:09:12	@J	the way to do it is to do them separately
2014-02-08 21:09:14	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-08 21:09:19	@J	which means implement an RSS feed
2014-02-08 21:10:04	@J	but yeah, this type of thing is bound to happen
2014-02-08 21:10:31	@J	ah, and it's another thing that's fixed to your browser, where I would prefer something standalone
2014-02-08 21:11:08	@J	and you have to be online for it to work?  Which I guess makes sense for most people, most of the time, but still
2014-02-08 21:11:35	@J	[21:10:04] @J but yeah, this type of thing is bound to happen
2014-02-08 21:11:38	@J	that was poorly worded
2014-02-08 21:12:03	@J	I mean, with YouTube doing what it's doing, these sorts of tools are bound to get made
2014-02-08 21:15:47	Espyo	yeah, definitely
2014-02-08 21:17:04	@J	so with a feed reader, I wanted to be able to perform bulk actions
2014-02-08 21:17:19	@J	select a load of items and do stuff with them
2014-02-08 21:17:41	@J	including defining custom commands to run the URLs (or title, content, etc.) through
2014-02-08 21:17:50	Espyo	ah
2014-02-08 21:17:56	@J	and optionally marking the items as read if the command successfully completes
2014-02-08 21:18:18	@J	maybe even define filters for automatically dispatching items through commands
2014-02-08 21:18:24	@J	power user-type stuff
2014-02-08 21:18:40	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-08 21:18:43	Espyo	dinner, brb

2014-02-09 14:45:17	@J	what do you think is a reasonable period of time between chickening what batteries exist?
2014-02-09 14:45:18	@J	whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
2014-02-09 14:45:22	@J	I'm not even hungry
2014-02-09 14:45:36	Miles_	......
2014-02-09 14:46:07	@J	I promise
2014-02-09 14:46:11	@J	don't judge me, Miles
2014-02-09 14:46:23	Espyo	...chickening
2014-02-09 14:46:27	Espyo	batteries?
2014-02-09 14:46:34	Espyo	didn't you mean battering chickens?
2014-02-09 14:46:40	@J	no
2014-02-09 14:46:55	@J	wait, battering as in food batter or pummelling them?
2014-02-09 14:47:17	Espyo	both work, because both make more sense than what you said
2014-02-09 14:47:24	Espyo	but I was actually thinking of the former
2014-02-09 14:48:14	@J	between checking what computer batteries exist
2014-02-09 14:48:41	Espyo	ok, I think I know what's up
2014-02-09 14:48:50	Espyo	I think you think you wrote "checking", but you wrote "chickening"
2014-02-09 14:48:59	Espyo	unless "chickening" is a synonym
2014-02-09 14:49:10	Espyo	'cause if you're on about your battery thing, NOW it all makes sense
2014-02-09 14:49:16	Espyo	EXCEPT... for the hunger comment
2014-02-09 14:49:26	@J	no, I know I wrote 'chickening', which is why I commented on it
2014-02-09 14:49:32	@J	but I thought it was obvious what I meant to write
2014-02-09 14:49:52	Espyo	I... see
2014-02-09 14:49:59	Espyo	you did this to confuse me, don't you
2014-02-09 14:50:02	@J	[14:46:11] @J don't judge me, Miles
2014-02-09 14:50:12	Espyo	yeah, makes sense in retrospect
2014-02-09 14:50:15	Espyo	also, 1 hour seems fine
2014-02-09 14:50:52	@J	1
2014-02-09 14:50:53	@J	hour
2014-02-09 14:50:59	@J	isn't that most of forever?
2014-02-09 14:51:04	@J	I was thinking more like 5 minutes
2014-02-09 14:51:19	Espyo	how often do you switch batteries?
2014-02-09 14:51:27	Espyo	I switch mine every infinite years
2014-02-09 14:56:13	@J	I know
2014-02-09 14:56:14	@J	but
2014-02-09 14:56:39	@J	if I'm going to do it, I don't want it to only realise once the new battery's run out
2014-02-09 14:56:45	@J	otherwise there's no point
2014-02-09 14:56:57	@J	also I sometimes remove the battery when it's running
2014-02-09 14:57:13	Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-02-09 14:57:16	Espyo	how costly is it?
2014-02-09 14:57:27	Espyo	I'm guessing "pretty much free"
2014-02-09 14:58:03	@J	it's basically a directory listing and then reading one file for each power source present
2014-02-09 14:58:09	@J	but this is an in-memory filesystem
2014-02-09 14:58:13	@J	so no actualy disk access
2014-02-09 14:58:17	@J	*actual
2014-02-09 15:00:08	@J	.02s of CPU time in 50 checks
2014-02-09 15:02:43	Espyo	hm
2014-02-09 15:02:44	Espyo	not bad
2014-02-09 15:02:48	Espyo	 5 minutes seems fine
2014-02-09 15:04:46	@J	5 minute chickens it is

2014-02-10 19:17:55	@J	all I know is it was 'East Africa'
2014-02-10 19:18:08	@J	but I thought it was New Zealand most of the time
2014-02-10 19:18:31	@J	now, it turns out my parents are getting passports IRL
2014-02-10 19:18:42	@J	they say it's to visit my brother in France
2014-02-10 19:19:23	@J	in my dream, when I found out, I thought, 'I knew my dad wouldn't get a passport just for that'
2014-02-10 19:19:32	@J	even though I only found out about the IRL bit afterwards
2014-02-10 19:19:36	@J	I'm so confused
2014-02-10 19:20:01	Espyo	hah
2014-02-10 19:20:15	Espyo	maybe you heard talk of it IRL while you were snoozing?
2014-02-10 19:20:36	@J	also the house wasn't really our house and one of the ceiling/walls was psychically see-through showing the night sky, 'just like in New Zealand'
2014-02-10 19:20:49	Espyo	good ol' New Zealand houses
2014-02-10 19:20:58	@J	well, I haven't been home for a while, so not likely
2014-02-10 19:21:05	@J	unless they were planning it over Christmas
2014-02-10 19:21:15	Espyo	hm, right
2014-02-10 19:21:28	@J	is the category protected?
2014-02-10 19:21:56	Espyo	coincidence then
2014-02-10 19:21:58	@J	it's like the time where my dad and I time-traveled
2014-02-10 19:21:59	Espyo	uh, protected?
2014-02-10 19:22:03	Espyo	well, I can't move it, I know that much
2014-02-10 19:22:06	@J	well, why can't you move it?
2014-02-10 19:22:08	@J	hmm
2014-02-10 19:22:14	Espyo	no move tab
2014-02-10 19:22:22	Espyo	oh, time travel
2014-02-10 19:22:27	Espyo	of course that explains the entire ordeal
2014-02-10 19:22:34	@J	wait, moving categories isn't a thing
2014-02-10 19:22:35	@J	is it?
2014-02-10 19:22:46	@J	oh, the time travel thing was all IRL
2014-02-10 19:22:48	@J	no dreams
2014-02-10 19:22:55	@J	I can't remember if I mentioned it before
2014-02-10 19:23:04	Espyo	don't think you did
2014-02-10 19:23:07	@J	hmm
2014-02-10 19:23:14	@J	well, I'll see if I can dig it up after food
2014-02-10 19:23:56	@J	yeah, AFAICT moving categories isn't a thing
2014-02-10 19:24:05	@J	it's something my bot library should be able to do
2014-02-10 19:24:18	@J	as in, it could at one point, before I half-rewrote the thing
2014-02-10 19:25:38	Espyo	well, luckily there's only like 8 articles there
2014-02-10 19:25:47	Espyo	and they're all there because of {{clean}}

2014-02-10 20:20:32	@J	yeah, can't find the time travel thing
2014-02-10 20:21:08	@J	IIRC, my dad and I were about to go out in the morning, so checked if my brother was awake yet
2014-02-10 20:21:23	@J	he wasn't even in, so he must've gone out
2014-02-10 20:21:38	@J	then some details involving texting each other
2014-02-10 20:21:52	Espyo	hm
2014-02-10 20:22:00	@J	and my brother claimed to have woken up and not found anyone in the house
2014-02-10 20:22:15	@J	and all the phone histories were conflicting
2014-02-10 20:22:36	Espyo	reminds of the time where uh...
2014-02-10 20:22:48	Espyo	something really confusing happened with a recorded Skype call and a Brawl moment
2014-02-10 20:22:54	Espyo	let me see if I can find out exactly again
2014-02-10 20:23:07	Espyo	plus it's relevant because I'm recording another batch of moments atm, to upload sometime tomorrow
2014-02-10 20:25:11	Espyo	ok, so there are three moments that happened from 2013/04/01 22:23 to 2013/04/01 22:50 something
2014-02-10 20:25:24	Espyo	in-game, when something happens, you can choose to save the replay file, so that's what these times are
2014-02-10 20:25:35	Espyo	the Skype call file that contained the commentary for these moments...
2014-02-10 20:25:44	Espyo	began on 2013/04/01 23:10:15
2014-02-10 20:25:58	Espyo	sure, it could just be miswritten times
2014-02-10 20:26:02	Espyo	but no
2014-02-10 20:26:18	Espyo	the replays have the date and time on the filename, and internally on the actual replay file itself
2014-02-10 20:26:28	Espyo	plus it's the time me and my friends see on all of our Wiis, so no internal shenanigans
2014-02-10 20:26:42	Espyo	as for the call file, when a recorded Skype call file is created, the start date is written on the filename
2014-02-10 20:26:55	Espyo	both the filename and creation date say it's that
2014-02-10 20:26:56	Espyo	so...
2014-02-10 20:27:09	Espyo	why can we only time travel when it's not really relevant?
2014-02-10 20:27:13	Espyo	I wanted to time travel at will...
2014-02-10 20:37:03	@J	crazy Windows bug that put everyone forward an hour at the same time?
2014-02-10 20:51:39	Espyo	wouldn't discard that idea
2014-02-10 20:52:33	Espyo	say, I don't think I've told you already
2014-02-10 20:52:39	Espyo	can't remember who I've said and haven't
2014-02-10 20:52:42	Espyo	but I'm an engineer now
2014-02-10 20:52:43	Espyo	college is over
2014-02-10 20:52:52	Espyo	all exams are over and I finally won't have to study anything any more
2014-02-10 20:53:05	Espyo	...except for my driving exams
2014-02-10 21:00:37	@J	engineer in what sense?
2014-02-10 21:08:33	Espyo	licensed
2014-02-10 21:08:55	Espyo	well, it works like this here: we have a "license degree" (?), then master's, than bachelor's
2014-02-10 21:08:59	Espyo	brb, dinner
2014-02-10 21:13:16	@J	right
2014-02-10 21:13:31	@J	but you wouldn't say having a degree makes you an engineer
2014-02-10 21:13:59	@J	maybe for a practical course
2014-02-10 21:57:27	Espyo	it does over here
2014-02-10 21:57:36	Espyo	as long as you have a degree, you're titled an engineer
2014-02-10 22:04:11	@J	hmm
2014-02-10 22:04:42	@J	wait, for any type of degree?
2014-02-10 22:11:14	Espyo	any type
2014-02-10 22:11:25	Espyo	"license", master's or bachelor's
2014-02-10 22:11:52	Espyo	uh... s/bachelor's/doctor's/
2014-02-10 22:12:03	Espyo	(I don't need to escape apostrophes, do I)
2014-02-10 22:13:27	@J	huh, that's weird
2014-02-10 22:13:36	@J	I thought you meant like computer engineer
2014-02-10 22:14:31	@J	okay, so I need a streaming XML parser for this program
2014-02-10 22:14:44	@J	turns out there are 3 different ones built in in Python
2014-02-10 22:15:06	Espyo	don't even tell me that
2014-02-10 22:15:10	Espyo	that's too awesome
2014-02-10 22:15:19	Espyo	...why 3, though?
2014-02-10 22:18:24	@J	well, one's newer
2014-02-10 22:18:32	@J	2 are wrappers around C libraries, I think
2014-02-10 22:18:50	@J	and I think one of those is kind of a standard thing/way of doing it ('SAX', if that means anything to you)
2014-02-10 22:19:08	@J	the newer one looks quite nice
2014-02-10 22:19:34	@J	it gives you an iterator you can loop over, and the tags you get can be edited in-place
2014-02-10 22:19:35	Espyo	oh

2014-02-11 00:03:18	Espyo	Scr7 is also on Mario Wiki, I believe
2014-02-11 00:03:23	Espyo	a few others are as well
2014-02-11 00:03:24	Spark	yeah
2014-02-11 00:04:08	Spark	hey esp i have a question that you probably cant answer because it's opengl stuff 
2014-02-11 00:04:09	Spark	but
2014-02-11 00:04:17	Spark	can i go ahead and ask anyways
2014-02-11 00:07:02	Espyo	sure
2014-02-11 00:09:26	Spark	okay so i made a window that's 600 by 800 pixels and drew a square in it
2014-02-11 00:09:45	Spark	the side ratio of the square SHOULD be 1:1 but for some reason it's taking the ratio of the window
2014-02-11 00:09:50	Spark	so 6:8 
2014-02-11 00:10:28	Spark	wat do
2014-02-11 00:15:36	Espyo	hmmm
2014-02-11 00:15:50	Espyo	it has to do with viewpoints
2014-02-11 00:15:56	Espyo	or... something of the sort
2014-02-11 00:16:03	Espyo	you have to set it so it follows a rectangular ratio

2014-02-12 21:40:24	koalabear83	help me
2014-02-12 21:41:00	Espyo	hmm?
2014-02-12 21:41:03	koalabear83	i was fighting the pileated snagret
2014-02-12 21:41:42	koalabear83	suddenly, my game froze, my remote was buzzing and i froze
2014-02-12 21:41:51	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-12 21:41:56	Espyo	how weird
2014-02-12 21:42:01	koalabear83	i cant restart
2014-02-12 21:42:04	Espyo	but it sounds like a regular freeze
2014-02-12 21:42:10	koalabear83	is it crashed
2014-02-12 21:42:12	Espyo	don't worry, hold down the power button for 5 seconds
2014-02-12 21:42:17	Espyo	but you can't do anything else now
2014-02-12 21:42:18	koalabear83	ok
2014-02-12 21:42:26	Espyo	the only wait out is really to force a shutdown by doing that
2014-02-12 21:42:49	Espyo	but yeah, the game could've frozen because the console is old, or the disc has some problem
2014-02-12 21:42:57	koalabear83	my remote turned off only
2014-02-12 21:43:01	Espyo	or it could just be a random occurrence
2014-02-12 21:43:06	Espyo	oh, I meant the power button on the actual Wii
2014-02-12 21:43:15	koalabear83	i took out the disk
2014-02-12 21:43:23	koalabear83	ok
2014-02-12 21:43:38	Espyo	check on lamp light to see if the disk is all scratched
2014-02-12 21:43:40	koalabear83	doesnt work
2014-02-12 21:43:54	Espyo	the 5-second power button thing?
2014-02-12 21:44:13	koalabear83	yep
2014-02-12 21:44:18	Espyo	wow
2014-02-12 21:44:19	Espyo	that's new
2014-02-12 21:44:24	Espyo	you sure you held for 5 seconds?
2014-02-12 21:44:28	Espyo	could be 6 or 7
2014-02-12 21:44:39	Espyo	I don't really count, but when my Wii freezes, I just hold the power button until it's off
2014-02-12 21:44:46	koalabear83	i just fought the bugs that give you sprays
2014-02-12 21:44:51	Espyo	you sure it's not the reset button either?
2014-02-12 21:44:57	koalabear83	yep
2014-02-12 21:45:01	Espyo	the Wistful Wild bugs?
2014-02-12 21:45:18	koalabear83	i had purples with a spray
2014-02-12 21:45:33	koalabear83	yeah those
2014-02-12 21:45:53	Espyo	then you went and fought a Pileated Snagret on the Dream Den, I imagine
2014-02-12 21:46:09	koalabear83	no
2014-02-12 21:46:13	Espyo	Hole of Heroes?
2014-02-12 21:46:36	koalabear83	i forgot about the snagret hole
2014-02-12 21:46:48	koalabear83	it was the end of the day
2014-02-12 21:48:14	Espyo	so you got sprays from the Wistful Wild bugs, then went into the Snagret Hole?
2014-02-12 21:48:39	koalabear83	yeah
2014-02-12 21:49:05	koalabear83	i didnt have time to go to the hole of heros
2014-02-12 21:49:10	Espyo	and then the game froze while fighting the Pileated Snagret... hmm
2014-02-12 21:49:40	Espyo	well, sounds like just a random crash, I wouldn't worry too much about it
2014-02-12 21:49:56	koalabear83	i was rapidly throwing purples 
2014-02-12 21:49:56	Espyo	but it'd be interesting if the crash happens every time the Pileated Snagret is fought after killing the Wistful Wild bugs
2014-02-12 21:50:04	Espyo	as if there was some glitch connected to the bugs
2014-02-12 21:50:13	Espyo	I can't test, but I'll tell PikFan to do so
2014-02-12 21:50:21	koalabear83	maybe because of that
2014-02-12 21:50:35	koalabear83	i killed others too
2014-02-12 21:50:57	koalabear83	the pikmin had a spray on them
2014-02-12 21:50:58	Espyo	Testyo: memo PikFan you need to try killing the WW bugs, then going to the Snagret Hole and battling a Pileated Snagret, on the NPC! version
2014-02-12 21:50:59	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for PikFan saying: you need to try killing the WW bugs, then going to the Snagret Hole and battling a Pileated Snagret, on the NPC! version.
2014-02-12 21:51:05	Espyo	oh, a spicy spray
2014-02-12 21:51:14	Espyo	I'll edit my memo to PikFan then
2014-02-12 21:51:18	koalabear83	yeah
2014-02-12 21:51:39	Espyo	done
2014-02-12 21:51:41	koalabear83	but only the purples
2014-02-12 21:51:46	Espyo	right, I added that too
2014-02-12 21:51:49	koalabear83	thank you
2014-02-12 21:51:54	Espyo	ok, he'll test when he can
2014-02-12 21:52:02	Espyo	it could be some glitch with the game, and the bugs
2014-02-12 21:52:06	Espyo	or it could just be a random crash
2014-02-12 21:52:09	koalabear83	ok i was just worried
2014-02-12 21:52:21	koalabear83	bye
2014-02-12 21:52:23	Espyo	no need to worry, it's probably nothing dangerous
2014-02-12 21:52:23	Espyo	bye
2014-02-12 21:52:37	koalabear83	thank you for your help

2014-02-12 21:53:38	Espyo	hehe
2014-02-12 21:53:47	Espyo	well, that was quite the story
2014-02-12 21:54:05	Espyo	I'd be really darn curious if the WW bugs caused Pileated Snagrets to glitch
2014-02-12 21:54:23	Espyo	maybe a buffer overflow, if the guy killed a lot of WW bugs and didn't collect the sprays
2014-02-12 21:54:34	Espyo	there is an on-map limit of sprays and nectar, after all
2014-02-12 21:55:04	Espyo	he's not a fanon user, it doesn't seem

2014-02-12 22:15:12	Espyo	heh
2014-02-12 22:15:26	Espyo	I really don't know
2014-02-12 22:15:57	@J	so...aren't you just meant to echo what they send you back at them?
2014-02-12 22:16:11	@J	and the sender can use whatever method he wants to distinguish between pings
2014-02-12 22:16:31	Espyo	don't see how that'd make sense
2014-02-12 22:16:32	@J	try that
2014-02-12 22:16:37	@J	it makes all the sense
2014-02-12 22:16:46	Espyo	I'll have to reprogram Testyo then

2014-02-12 22:21:07	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2014-02-12 22:21:13	Espyo	ok... try it
2014-02-12 22:33:18	@J	it worked
2014-02-12 22:34:18	Espyo	so you didn't just get 0 ms delay as a final response?
2014-02-12 22:34:28	Espyo	you get an actual delay number that makes sense?
2014-02-12 22:37:06	@J	yeah
2014-02-12 22:37:30	@J	I'm guessing - and this might sound crazy - that the client takes the time from sending the request to receiving the response
2014-02-12 22:37:59	@J	as opposed to assuming the remote has its clock synced to within a millisecond of the client
2014-02-12 22:46:10	Espyo	yeah, makes sense, I suppose
2014-02-12 22:46:18	Espyo	why does the number that's sent matter, then?
2014-02-12 22:46:34	Espyo	oh, so the receiver of the request can also know, by comparing the number?
2014-02-12 22:47:12	@J	I guess so, yeah

2014-02-13 00:52:42	Testyo	Hey PikFan, there's a memo for you from Espyo, written on 10/02/2014 18:55 (GMT), saying: you may want to copy-paste my latest revision on [[Help:Chat]] from canon to fanon.
2014-02-13 00:52:42	Testyo	Hey PikFan, there's a memo for you from Espyo, written on 12/02/2014 21:51 (GMT), saying: you need to try killing the WW bugs, then going to the Snagret Hole and battling a Pileated Snagret with spicy Purples, on the NPC! version.
2014-02-13 00:53:55	@PikFan	how are the ujadani and the Pileated Snagret related...?
2014-02-13 00:56:29	Espyo	I don't know
2014-02-13 00:56:35	Espyo	but Koalabearsomething came here earlier
2014-02-13 00:56:40	Espyo	worried about his game
2014-02-13 00:57:04	Espyo	it had crashed while fighting a PS
2014-02-13 00:57:11	Espyo	he pointed out he had gotten sprays from the Ujadani earlier
2014-02-13 00:57:22	Espyo	so maybe, just maybe, there's a glitch that can happen
2014-02-13 00:57:27	Espyo	it's not completely off the hook
2014-02-13 00:57:44	Espyo	you know how the Ujadani can let go more sprays and nectars than the on-screen limit?
2014-02-13 00:57:45	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2014-02-13 00:57:54	Espyo	maybe crossing that limits corrupts something somewhere on the memory
2014-02-13 00:57:55	@PikFan	yeah?
2014-02-13 00:58:03	Espyo	and Pileated Snagrets happen to access that memory
2014-02-13 00:58:05	Espyo	and... crash
2014-02-13 00:58:17	Espyo	I honestly doubt it's repeatable, chances are it was just a random Wii freeze
2014-02-13 00:58:17	@PikFan	interesting
2014-02-13 00:58:22	Espyo	old Wii or scratched disk
2014-02-13 00:58:35	Espyo	or alternately, a very precise combination of actions and variables lead to the crash
2014-02-13 00:58:36	@PikFan	yeah, could try it
2014-02-13 00:58:43	Espyo	but who knows, it might be as easy as several Uajadani + a PS
2014-02-13 00:59:06	@PikFan	good thing I have a save file at day 31
2014-02-13 00:59:11	Espyo	nice
2014-02-13 00:59:19	Espyo	so, he said he got the Ujadani
2014-02-13 00:59:30	Espyo	then tried going for the HoH, but there wasn't enough time left on the day
2014-02-13 00:59:40	Espyo	so he went for the SH on AW
2014-02-13 00:59:51	Espyo	purples only, I think? he wasn't too explicit on that part
2014-02-13 00:59:57	Espyo	sprayed them up, and attack the Snagret
2014-02-13 01:00:19	Espyo	I could've asked what the Snagret did when the crash happened, but it's not like it has any particularly different or rare moves
2014-02-13 01:00:25	Espyo	so testing everything on the Snagret should be easy
2014-02-13 01:00:40	Espyo	also, he pointed out that holding the power button for 5 seconds did NOT shut the Wii off
2014-02-13 01:00:41	Espyo	as it should
2014-02-13 01:00:54	Espyo	I think he eventually shut it off, but never said how
2014-02-13 01:01:05	Espyo	either he didn't hold it for long enough, or that crash must've really hit deep
2014-02-13 01:01:23	Espyo	I think I saw some crashes once or twice that didn't even allow you to shut down with the power button; the console had to be shut down by force
2014-02-13 01:02:35	@PikFan	heh, my poor Wii has been through a lot
2014-02-13 01:03:03	@PikFan	it's fallen off the entertainment center quite a few times
2014-02-13 01:03:10	@PikFan	but still works
2014-02-13 01:03:55	Espyo	heh
2014-02-13 01:04:01	Espyo	don't worry, it's made of Nintendium
2014-02-13 01:04:05	Espyo	as are most Nintendo things
2014-02-13 01:04:13	Espyo	it can survive over 300 Gs of force
2014-02-13 01:04:50	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-13 01:05:09	@PikFan	gotta love Nintendo hardware
2014-02-13 01:05:19	@PikFan	unlike its software...
2014-02-13 01:05:41	 *	@PikFan glares at Pikmin 2's files
2014-02-13 01:06:37	@PikFan	anyway, going to try that
2014-02-13 01:06:43	@PikFan	wait
2014-02-13 01:06:44	Espyo	good luck
2014-02-13 01:07:22	@PikFan	so what do I do with the bugs? just kill them all, and then drink all the nectar?
2014-02-13 01:07:35	Espyo	he only said he killed them
2014-02-13 01:07:36	@PikFan	*sprays
2014-02-13 01:07:40	Espyo	but I honestly doubt he ignored the sprays
2014-02-13 01:07:53	Espyo	but for the sake of maximizing the chances of a glitch happening
2014-02-13 01:07:53	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-13 01:07:58	Espyo	leave them all there
2014-02-13 01:08:02	Espyo	maybe collect one or two
2014-02-13 01:08:06	@PikFan	okay
2014-02-13 01:08:22	Espyo	because my "nectars and sprays going over the limit and breaking memory" theory might bring us closer than not

2014-02-13 01:19:02	Espyo	oh yeah, I keep forgetting there are two
2014-02-13 01:19:11	Espyo	I'd bet on the one closest to DD
2014-02-13 01:19:26	@PikFan	okay
2014-02-13 01:19:31	Espyo	uh... HoH
2014-02-13 01:20:06	Espyo	...the one closest to the Chrysanthemums, Withering Blowhogs and the mushroom treasure
2014-02-13 01:20:34	@PikFan	so DD, then
2014-02-13 01:21:23	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-13 01:29:43	@PikFan	killed the Snagret
2014-02-13 01:29:56	@PikFan	no freeze
2014-02-13 01:30:04	Espyo	oh well
2014-02-13 01:30:10	Espyo	just a random occurrence then

2014-02-13 02:03:37	Espyo	but fetching random values isn't
2014-02-13 02:03:49	Espyo	well, 12th of February makes more sense
2014-02-13 02:04:05	Espyo	but yeah, that's it
2014-02-13 02:04:42	@PikFan	the code for it is

2014-02-13 02:04:51	Espyo	hm
2014-02-13 02:04:54	Espyo	meh
2014-02-13 02:05:58	Espyo	one thing I was worried about, but apparently in vain
2014-02-13 02:06:06	Espyo	fanon fans are pretty good at making maps, actually
2014-02-13 02:06:18	Espyo	I thought most would just make like 2 rooms connected by a corridor and call it a day
2014-02-13 02:06:19	Espyo	but no
2014-02-13 02:06:38	Espyo	most could use less linearity, but not bad
2014-02-13 02:07:08	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-13 02:07:16	@PikFan	I created 3 maps a while back
2014-02-13 02:07:25	Espyo	oh, may I see?
2014-02-13 02:09:08	@PikFan	here http://www.pikminfanon.com/Frosty_Depths#Gallery
2014-02-13 02:09:25	@PikFan	I quickly put these together using Paint
2014-02-13 02:09:29	Espyo	not bad
2014-02-13 02:09:35	Espyo	they're simple, but cave layouts usually are
2014-02-13 02:09:36	Espyo	so...
2014-02-13 02:09:49	@PikFan	and this is the first cave in the game
2014-02-13 02:09:55	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-13 02:10:24	@PikFan	note how sublevel 1 is especially similar to sublevel 1 of the Emergence Cave
2014-02-13 02:10:30	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-13 02:10:44	Espyo	I have to get going, but I wanted something from yuo
2014-02-13 02:10:45	Espyo	*you
2014-02-13 02:10:51	@PikFan	yeah?
2014-02-13 02:10:57	Espyo	if you could, please compile a list of the most common special mechanics in fan games
2014-02-13 02:11:02	Espyo	I noticed weather is one of them
2014-02-13 02:11:09	Espyo	so I already started a weather system of sorts
2014-02-13 02:11:30	Espyo	it's better to know what kind of extra mechanics I need to implement on the engine earlier than late
2014-02-13 02:11:32	@PikFan	oh, is this for the engine?
2014-02-13 02:11:34	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-13 02:11:38	@PikFan	ah
2014-02-13 02:11:51	Espyo	by "extra mechanics", I mean game mechanics you can't find in Pikmin or Pikmin 2
2014-02-13 02:11:59	@PikFan	or Pikmin 3
2014-02-13 02:12:02	Espyo	I can see Pikmin 3 has a half-dozen of kooky mechanics, so...
2014-02-13 02:12:13	Espyo	no, because I still haven't made any Pikmin 3 mechanic bar leader throwing
2014-02-13 02:12:21	@PikFan	...oh
2014-02-13 02:12:27	Espyo	and I don't know most of them anyway
2014-02-13 02:12:37	Espyo	I'd rather focus on mechanics the fans are looking for, though
2014-02-13 02:12:43	@PikFan	there's often new upgrades and sprays
2014-02-13 02:13:05	Espyo	right, but those aren't quite gameplay mechanics
2014-02-13 02:13:12	Espyo	sprays are still the spray mechanic from Pikmin 2
2014-02-13 02:13:18	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-13 02:13:19	Espyo	...although some sprays could introduce new mechanics
2014-02-13 02:13:28	Espyo	but I think I've got spray customization under control, for now
2014-02-13 02:13:37	@PikFan	I have a spray that damages enemies
2014-02-13 02:13:39	Espyo	upgrades are a bit trickier, but kinda the same thing
2014-02-13 02:13:47	Espyo	oh, that should be easy enough
2014-02-13 02:14:16	Espyo	I mean mechanics more like the weather changing from day to day, and it having an impact on the Pikmin you can have outside, or enemies that spawn
2014-02-13 02:14:19	@PikFan	though the damage depends on the kind of enemy, and where it was sprayed from
2014-02-13 02:14:29	Espyo	and also that thing on your game, where you can choose to stay at night a bit more
2014-02-13 02:14:32	@PikFan	OH
2014-02-13 02:14:34	@PikFan	NIGHT
2014-02-13 02:14:48	Espyo	hehe
2014-02-13 02:14:56	@PikFan	night is another recurring mechanic
2014-02-13 02:15:01	Espyo	now I just need more of those types of mechanics
2014-02-13 02:15:08	Espyo	is it? I'll keep it in mind then
2014-02-13 02:15:13	Espyo	what's mostly done with night time?
2014-02-13 02:15:21	Espyo	what you do in your game? make it optional and harder than day time?
2014-02-13 02:15:24	@PikFan	more enemies, typically
2014-02-13 02:15:33	@PikFan	yeah, it's optional
2014-02-13 02:15:36	Espyo	fair enough
2014-02-13 02:16:06	@PikFan	and in my game you can explore an area less at night than at day
2014-02-13 02:16:20	Espyo	less?
2014-02-13 02:16:28	@PikFan	like...
2014-02-13 02:16:49	@PikFan	days in my game last exactly 15 minutes
2014-02-13 02:17:16	@PikFan	if you choose to explore during the night, you stay another 5 minutes
2014-02-13 02:17:38	Espyo	ah, right
2014-02-13 02:17:51	@PikFan	the catch is, though, the next day you land a little later
2014-02-13 02:18:19	Espyo	mhm, I remember you saying that
2014-02-13 02:18:24	Espyo	anyway, any other common mechanic?
2014-02-13 02:18:34	Espyo	check the best games first, if you need ideas
2014-02-13 02:19:04	Espyo	worse games (no offence to anybody, but some things are just better than others) normally won't make better real fan games
2014-02-13 02:19:09	Espyo	so... let's aim for quality here
2014-02-13 02:19:25	@PikFan	will there be modes other than story mode?
2014-02-13 02:20:07	Espyo	 1-4 player story, 1-4 player challenge and 2-4 player battle, yeah
2014-02-13 02:20:23	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-13 02:20:25	Espyo	anything else really cannot be made with game data alone, it has to be programmed into the engine on purpose
2014-02-13 02:20:29	Espyo	besides the options, of course
2014-02-13 02:20:33	@PikFan	what about cave creator?
2014-02-13 02:20:35	Espyo	and high scores and whatnot
2014-02-13 02:20:39	Espyo	that'll come bundled too
2014-02-13 02:20:42	Espyo	but only in development mode
2014-02-13 02:20:46	@PikFan	there's usually a cave creator â€” ah, okay
2014-02-13 02:20:49	Espyo	a fangame has two modes, development and release
2014-02-13 02:20:56	Espyo	logically, you use the development mode while making the game
2014-02-13 02:21:05	Espyo	it gives you access to the level creators and such
2014-02-13 02:21:33	Espyo	though if you think of something like a player having a cave creator, to play with their friends, all inside Pikmin: Return of the Goop Blops
2014-02-13 02:21:36	Espyo	that won't happen
2014-02-13 02:21:41	Espyo	I won't make a player-type cave creator
2014-02-13 02:22:04	Espyo	because if they want their own 2-player challenge mode cave, for instance, they can just create one in development mode, as if they were game makers
2014-02-13 02:22:13	@PikFan	Goop Blops?
2014-02-13 02:22:13	Espyo	it's not as cozy, but it's possible
2014-02-13 02:22:16	Espyo	so it's impossible
2014-02-13 02:22:19	@PikFan	was that something you made up?
2014-02-13 02:22:25	Espyo	(demonstration name)
2014-02-13 02:22:35	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-13 02:22:37	Espyo	((made up))
2014-02-13 02:23:07	@PikFan	(((yeah)))
2014-02-13 02:23:15	Espyo	OH!
2014-02-13 02:23:20	Espyo	I almost forgot something important
2014-02-13 02:23:24	Espyo	well, mostly important for my life
2014-02-13 02:23:26	Espyo	I graduated
2014-02-13 02:23:31	@PikFan	!!!!!!!
2014-02-13 02:23:35	Espyo	...not legally yet, but practically, I did
2014-02-13 02:23:40	Espyo	my final final score came, and I passed
2014-02-13 02:23:45	Espyo	that means I passed everything
2014-02-13 02:23:50	Espyo	so now I have a LOT of free time
2014-02-13 02:23:57	@PikFan	well congratulations!
2014-02-13 02:24:01	Espyo	plus as a reward, I'm sure to get a Wii U soon
2014-02-13 02:24:03	Espyo	thanks!
2014-02-13 02:24:12	Espyo	it's really stupendous
2014-02-13 02:24:27	Espyo	happier Espyo, Espyo with more free time, Espyo closer to Pikmin 3, ...
2014-02-13 02:24:37	@PikFan	now you just have to go to another 2 years of college to continue studying for programming
2014-02-13 02:24:56	Espyo	hehe nope
2014-02-13 02:24:57	@PikFan	......of course, if you want to
2014-02-13 02:25:01	Espyo	not going for a master's degree
2014-02-13 02:25:14	Espyo	the next thing I'll be studying is my for my driver's exam
2014-02-13 02:25:15	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-13 02:25:19	Espyo	whenever that may happen
2014-02-13 02:25:23	Espyo	I'm throw with studying
2014-02-13 02:25:28	Espyo	I never really learn anything useful
2014-02-13 02:25:33	Espyo	and so many things don't interest me
2014-02-13 02:25:36	@PikFan	you don't have a driver's license?
2014-02-13 02:25:38	Espyo	I had to take physics for four years
2014-02-13 02:25:41	Espyo	not yet I dont
2014-02-13 02:25:43	Espyo	*don't
2014-02-13 02:25:51	Espyo	(this apostrophe key is going to be the death of me, I swear)
2014-02-13 02:25:53	@PikFan	also: *through with studying
2014-02-13 02:26:03	Espyo	woops
2014-02-13 02:26:06	Espyo	yeah, it's 2AM
2014-02-13 02:26:07	@PikFan	hehe
2014-02-13 02:26:11	Espyo	...2:26
2014-02-13 02:26:18	@PikFan	clearly
2014-02-13 02:26:25	Espyo	I really wanted to go to bed, but I still wanted to know about the common mechanics thing

2014-02-13 02:26:35	Espyo	anything else you can immediately remember?
2014-02-13 02:26:48	@PikFan	but anyway, in Portugal, you can't have your driver's license until you're in your 20's?
2014-02-13 02:26:55	Espyo	no no
2014-02-13 02:27:02	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-13 02:27:05	Espyo	you can have it starting at 18
2014-02-13 02:27:12	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-02-13 02:27:13	Espyo	it's just that it doesn't matter much, really
2014-02-13 02:27:17	@PikFan	mm
2014-02-13 02:27:19	Espyo	we don't usually get a license super early
2014-02-13 02:27:23	Espyo	specially if we don't need one
2014-02-13 02:27:37	Espyo	I have a bus and subway that have stops right in front of my home and college
2014-02-13 02:27:44	Espyo	(right in front = 3-minute walk)
2014-02-13 02:27:45	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-13 02:27:51	@PikFan	how convenient
2014-02-13 02:27:52	Espyo	so why should I need a car?
2014-02-13 02:27:55	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-13 02:28:08	Espyo	though it's a bit normal for stops to be near hospitals and colleges and whatnot
2014-02-13 02:28:17	Espyo	as for my home stop, I live close to a really big mall, so...

2014-02-13 02:28:28	@PikFan	*mm
2014-02-13 02:28:36	Espyo	plus, studying engineering while studying for driving only ends in disaster
2014-02-13 02:28:44	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-13 02:29:04	Espyo	unless you're really good at memorizing stuff (I'm not, I'm good at understanding stuff), and you have free time (I don't: Testyo, engine, etc. etc.), you really can't afford to study both
2014-02-13 02:29:09	@PikFan	heh, now I'm not sure if I want to study for my driver's exam in high school
2014-02-13 02:29:16	Espyo	but now that that's different for me, I'll get mine soon enough
2014-02-13 02:29:28	Espyo	hehe, it depends on whether you'll need a car or not
2014-02-13 02:29:34	Espyo	but you'll see in due time, really
2014-02-13 02:29:54	@PikFan	well, THAT exam happens when you're 16, and you get your license
2014-02-13 02:30:09	@PikFan	there's a written driving exam that happens when you're 15
2014-02-13 02:30:09	Espyo	wait, that happens IN high school?
2014-02-13 02:30:16	@PikFan	and you get your permit
2014-02-13 02:30:18	@PikFan	no no
2014-02-13 02:30:19	Espyo	mandatorily?
2014-02-13 02:30:23	Espyo	oh, started to scare me
2014-02-13 02:30:29	@PikFan	you have to go to the DMV to do it
2014-02-13 02:30:34	Espyo	right
2014-02-13 02:30:45	Espyo	we have a written one as well
2014-02-13 02:30:48	Espyo	but it's not related to anything
2014-02-13 02:30:57	Espyo	it's just there, take it when you want to start driving
2014-02-13 02:31:06	@PikFan	I assume you know what a driver's permit is
2014-02-13 02:31:11	Espyo	yeah, the license
2014-02-13 02:31:18	@PikFan	...oh
2014-02-13 02:31:20	Espyo	little card thing
2014-02-13 02:31:21	@PikFan	well
2014-02-13 02:31:22	Espyo	is it not?
2014-02-13 02:31:26	@PikFan	in the United States
2014-02-13 02:31:39	@PikFan	you get your permit when you take the written test at 15
2014-02-13 02:31:54	@PikFan	and you get your license when you take the actual test at 16
2014-02-13 02:32:00	Espyo	oh, I see
2014-02-13 02:32:04	Espyo	yeah, really different here then
2014-02-13 02:32:14	@PikFan	the permit means that you can't drive without an adult in the car
2014-02-13 02:32:21	Espyo	right
2014-02-13 02:32:24	@PikFan	well, responsible adult
2014-02-13 02:32:39	Espyo	here, when you're 18+ just pick any time to take classes, do a written test, do some live driving tests, and you're all set
2014-02-13 02:32:44	Espyo	of course, provided you pass
2014-02-13 02:32:48	@PikFan	right
2014-02-13 02:32:54	Espyo	anyway, the mechanics?
2014-02-13 02:32:58	Espyo	I reeeeally have to go
2014-02-13 02:33:02	Espyo	not reaaally, but...
2014-02-13 02:33:07	@PikFan	yeah, I'll have to go through them
2014-02-13 02:33:09	Espyo	I don't have anything else open, just the IRC
2014-02-13 02:33:13	Espyo	so I can't even bide my time elsewhere
2014-02-13 02:33:19	Espyo	if you please, then
2014-02-13 02:33:20	@PikFan	hah
2014-02-13 02:33:23	Espyo	let me know anything tomorrow

2014-02-13 02:34:47	Espyo	he ignores ellipsis for some reason

2014-02-13 02:34:57	@PikFan	odd
2014-02-13 02:34:58	Espyo	yeah, midday to 1 or 2 AM
2014-02-13 02:35:08	Espyo	he doesn't use the normal way to find words, for the conversions
2014-02-13 02:35:27	Espyo	it's a particular code, and it just clumps ellipsis together as a "word"
2014-02-13 02:35:36	Espyo	anyway, memo me or let me know tomorrow or whenever
2014-02-13 02:35:37	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-13 02:35:40	@PikFan	okay

2014-02-13 02:35:54	Espyo	if I don't have an aim for which mechanics to implement, the engine won't be very robust
2014-02-13 02:35:59	Espyo	also, common types of Pikmin and enemies
2014-02-13 02:36:09	@PikFan	okay
2014-02-13 02:36:11	Espyo	they aren't really mechanics, but then I'll know what /attributes/ to look out for

2014-02-13 02:49:26	TehPehEhm	Hello
2014-02-13 02:49:46	@PikFan	why are you stumped?
2014-02-13 02:50:18	TehPehEhm	I'm trying to think of what to add in the next chappy of my fanfic
2014-02-13 02:50:29	TehPehEhm	I'm debating on two things

2014-02-13 02:55:23	TehPehEhm	New member of the guild

2014-02-13 02:55:49	TehPehEhm	New Pikminjp
2014-02-13 03:00:45	TehPehEhm	What do the user rights "patrolled" and "autopatrolled" mean?
2014-02-13 03:01:05	@PikFan	well
2014-02-13 03:02:01	@PikFan	so when you're a patroller, most edits have a red checkmark next to them (!)
2014-02-13 03:02:16	@PikFan	these edits mean that they're unpatrolled
2014-02-13 03:02:26	TehPehEhm	What?
2014-02-13 03:02:34	@PikFan	so the patrollers will go look at the edit
2014-02-13 03:02:45	@PikFan	and they patrol the edit
2014-02-13 03:02:55	TehPehEhm	What does that mean?
2014-02-13 03:03:08	@PikFan	it means they check it
2014-02-13 03:03:16	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-02-13 03:03:26	@PikFan	so they look at it
2014-02-13 03:03:27	TehPehEhm	What about autopatrolled?
2014-02-13 03:03:36	@PikFan	and if it's good, they patrol it
2014-02-13 03:03:58	@PikFan	or if it's something minor they fix, they still patrol it and fix whatever mistake there was
2014-02-13 03:04:08	TehPehEhm	Ok
2014-02-13 03:04:19	TehPehEhm	What about autopatrolled?
2014-02-13 03:04:26	@PikFan	but if there's something beyond their control, they leave it unpatrolled so somebody else can come along and fix it

2014-02-13 18:22:33	Espyo	uh, I know you see some splooge come out after it's born, but
2014-02-13 18:22:39	Espyo	the cord doesn't sound right
2014-02-13 18:22:42	Espyo	I'll check the model
2014-02-13 18:23:24	Prezintenden	they have this tiny tail, but... that could be anything, and it's pointy and stuff
2014-02-13 18:23:49	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-13 18:27:33	Prezintenden	found the editor, he has 2 mainspace edits... I'll go ahead and remove that

2014-02-13 18:28:35	Espyo	but nothing umbilical-cord-like

2014-02-13 18:30:54	Prezintenden	what did i not italicize?
2014-02-13 18:31:13	Espyo	"dumbed down" isn't even a very good expression, I found a replacement

2014-02-14 18:16:01	@PikFan	when I saw they added Prisms
2014-02-14 18:16:36	@PikFan	my CpS, in half an hour, went from 1 trillion to 10 trillion
2014-02-14 18:17:04	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-14 18:17:13	Espyo	I'm checking the new things right now
2014-02-14 18:17:23	Espyo	I was only going to do so tomorrow, because I had wrinklers busy already
2014-02-14 18:17:28	Espyo	but hey, guess what, Firefox hates me and crashed
2014-02-14 18:17:31	Espyo	so might as well go now
2014-02-14 18:17:58	Espyo	oh, a bar appears on the bottom when you get a Golden Cookie with lasting effects
2014-02-14 18:18:08	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-14 18:18:20	@PikFan	oh, I'm sorry to hear that
2014-02-14 18:18:30	@PikFan	and I haven't noticed the bar thingy
2014-02-14 18:18:43	@PikFan	(late response because of Cookie Chain)
2014-02-14 18:20:39	@PikFan	I did a calculation just now
2014-02-14 18:21:20	@PikFan	the total cost of 100 Prisms is exactly 391,437,483,566,762,819 cookies
2014-02-14 18:22:03	@PikFan	...provided that you haven't unlocked the Santa upgrades
2014-02-14 18:23:15	Espyo	I just bought 100 straight away
2014-02-14 18:23:23	Espyo	reached 106 of them
2014-02-14 18:23:27	Espyo	plus all Valentine cookies
2014-02-14 18:23:27	@PikFan	if you have unlocked all Santa upgrades, then the cost is 364,036,859,717,089,421, cookies
2014-02-14 18:23:44	Espyo	all those things increased my CpS by...
2014-02-14 18:23:51	Espyo	oh, not much, just 14x
2014-02-14 18:23:58	@PikFan	o_.

2014-02-14 18:24:46	@PikFan	it's going to take FOREVER to get 150 Prisms...
2014-02-14 18:24:48	Espyo	had I known there'd be something at 5k, I wouldn't have reset as early as I did in the previous game
2014-02-14 18:24:49	Testyo	5 K = -268.15 Â°C / -450.67 Â°F

2014-02-14 20:45:34	@PikFan	it's even uglier in monobook http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Bulborb?useskin=monobook

2014-02-15 01:14:33	Espyo	ok, I think I'm starting to understand how enemy numbers work
2014-02-15 01:14:37	Espyo	they're incredibly complicated
2014-02-15 01:14:51	Espyo	so "31" shearwigs of "type" "0"
2014-02-15 01:15:01	Espyo	...is combined with "31" male and "31" female sheargrubs
2014-02-15 01:15:21	Espyo	...and that means that there must be a total of 12 of those three types of enemies
2014-02-15 01:15:28	Espyo	and at least 3 in each group...?
2014-02-15 01:15:30	Espyo	need more testing
2014-02-15 01:15:38	Espyo	PikFan, how free are you?
2014-02-15 01:24:31	--	Sporklight2forever is now known as Spark
2014-02-15 01:35:39	Espyo	never mind, I experimented, and that has to be it
2014-02-15 01:39:51	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-02-15 01:40:18	Espyo	the ingame files in Pikmin 2
2014-02-15 01:40:23	Espyo	saying weird numbers
2014-02-15 01:40:30	@PikFan	typical
2014-02-15 01:40:38	Espyo	but after reloading the Rumbling Grotto 10 or so times, I think I confirmed what they mean
2014-02-15 01:42:42	@PikFan	what do they mean?
2014-02-15 01:45:34	Espyo	it's complicated
2014-02-15 01:45:45	Espyo	but when there are several enemies with "31" as their "number"
2014-02-15 01:45:51	Espyo	and "0" as their "type"
2014-02-15 01:46:08	Espyo	I think that means "add all digits of all numbers"
2014-02-15 01:46:29	Espyo	so three enemies with their numbers as "31" means 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 12
2014-02-15 01:46:44	Espyo	that number represents the total number of enemies of that group that must spawn
2014-02-15 01:47:04	Espyo	because the files say there's "31" Shearwigs, "31" Males and "31" Female Sheargrubs
2014-02-15 01:47:11	Espyo	and I checked the Rumbling Grotto over and over
2014-02-15 01:47:20	Espyo	and the numbers varied between 3 and 6
2014-02-15 01:47:31	Espyo	but the total of Shearwigs, Males and Females was ALWAYS 12
2014-02-15 01:47:49	Espyo	dunno if the "31" is actually supposed to be like that (3 + 1 over and over)
2014-02-15 01:47:58	Espyo	and dunno if the type being 0 has anything to do with it
2014-02-15 01:48:03	Espyo	but I'll have to check other caves
2014-02-15 01:48:13	@PikFan	what's the type, again?
2014-02-15 01:48:29	Espyo	 0
2014-02-15 01:48:39	Espyo	we don't know what it means
2014-02-15 01:48:49	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-15 01:49:28	@PikFan	why are Pikmin 2's files so complicated
2014-02-15 01:49:40	Espyo	it's a mystery

2014-02-15 01:58:15	@PikFan	also Espyo
2014-02-15 01:58:27	Espyo	hmm?
2014-02-15 01:58:33	@PikFan	for sublevel 1 of the Emergence Cave, why are there so many cave units?
2014-02-15 01:58:57	@PikFan	since many of them aren't used
2014-02-15 01:59:10	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-15 01:59:12	Espyo	beats me
2014-02-15 01:59:33	Espyo	I think they copy-pasted a lot of the files
2014-02-15 01:59:55	Espyo	because almost all sublevel unit files have the dead ends, corridors and crossings
2014-02-15 02:00:03	Espyo	they're a lot more needed than not, so that's why
2014-02-15 02:00:14	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-15 02:00:21	@PikFan	does make sense
2014-02-15 02:00:47	Espyo	also everything works well on that sublevel because the game is told to only place 2 rooms
2014-02-15 02:01:09	Espyo	and because it can place the rooms without any corridors, crossings or dead ends, it does so
2014-02-15 02:01:33	Espyo	I don't know what stops the game from just adding a load of straight corridors between both rooms
2014-02-15 02:01:44	Espyo	it might use the least number of corridors possible, which is 0 in this case
2014-02-15 02:01:58	Espyo	but I've seen caves where you have exits with really long corridors that lead directly to a dead end
2014-02-15 02:02:08	Espyo	so that's just arbitrary corridor and dead end placement
2014-02-15 02:04:21	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-15 02:15:56	Espyo	I just want to know why "11" eggs of type "1" means 0 eggs
2014-02-15 02:16:05	Espyo	it happens on the Sniper Room and Breeding Ground 3

2014-02-15 17:09:24	@PikFan	.
2014-02-15 17:09:30	@PikFan	ok so
2014-02-15 17:09:35	@PikFan	last night in CC
2014-02-15 17:09:45	@PikFan	I made 9.4 quint in 7 hours
2014-02-15 17:09:51	@PikFan	er
2014-02-15 17:09:54	@PikFan	7-8 hours
2014-02-15 17:10:25	@PikFan	I need to reach 24 quint all time to get 7k HCs
2014-02-15 17:10:25	Testyo	7 K = -266.15 Â°C / -447.07 Â°F
2014-02-15 17:10:51	Espyo	wow
2014-02-15 17:11:11	@PikFan	how many cookies have you baked so far?
2014-02-15 17:12:00	@PikFan	...oh, I guess I need 24.5 quint
2014-02-15 17:12:04	@PikFan	close enough
2014-02-15 17:12:43	Espyo	this game?
2014-02-15 17:12:56	@PikFan	no, all time
2014-02-15 17:13:12	@PikFan	all time I've baked 22,063,926,103,076,946,000 cookies
2014-02-15 17:13:16	Espyo	 18,473,637,937,785,254,000 all time
2014-02-15 17:13:28	Espyo	...why does it have to be so hard to c+p the number...
2014-02-15 17:13:53	@PikFan	because it keeps changing to correspond to the cookies being baked
2014-02-15 17:14:33	@PikFan	but yeah, I mostly owe this to GCs
2014-02-15 17:14:47	Espyo	ah, right
2014-02-15 17:14:49	Espyo	(and cheats)
2014-02-15 17:14:52	@PikFan	frenzy + lucky GCs give me about 150 quad
2014-02-15 17:14:55	@PikFan	:|
2014-02-15 17:15:10	@PikFan	I haven't used cheats for a while
2014-02-15 17:15:23	@PikFan	and I don't plan on it anytime soon
2014-02-15 17:15:30	@PikFan	because prisms
2014-02-15 17:16:07	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmmm
2014-02-15 17:16:26	@PikFan	when I get 7k HCs, my max cps should be at /least/ 25 tril
2014-02-15 17:16:26	Testyo	7 K = -266.15 Â°C / -447.07 Â°F
2014-02-15 17:16:37	@PikFan	maybe 30
2014-02-15 17:16:55	@PikFan	18,546,426,453,123.2 right now
2014-02-15 17:17:19	@PikFan	...oh, heh
2014-02-15 17:17:20	Espyo	but cheats did increase your overall count
2014-02-15 17:17:29	@PikFan	oh, right
2014-02-15 17:17:33	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-02-15 17:18:18	@PikFan	my cps is almost exactly a millionth that of your cookies all time
2014-02-15 17:19:39	@PikFan	and I can't buy any more prisms now, because they cost 1.083 quint now
2014-02-15 17:20:16	@PikFan	I could, but I'd need at least 2.6 quint in the bank
2014-02-15 17:20:31	@PikFan	so GC profits are maximized
2014-02-15 17:20:54	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-15 17:23:00	@PikFan	...
2014-02-15 17:23:19	@PikFan	you need about 34 quint to buy 150 ACs
2014-02-15 17:23:59	Espyo	ouch
2014-02-15 17:24:07	Espyo	but... it's not that much
2014-02-15 17:24:07	@PikFan	maybe I'll achieve it when I get 10k HCs
2014-02-15 17:24:08	Testyo	10 K = -263.15 Â°C / -441.67 Â°F
2014-02-15 17:24:17	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-15 17:24:17	Espyo	you sure it isn't 34 sex?
2014-02-15 17:24:31	@PikFan	no
2014-02-15 17:25:14	@PikFan	(base cost * (1.15 ^ n - ))/ 0.15 = total cost of n number of buildings
2014-02-15 17:25:46	Espyo	hmmm...
2014-02-15 17:31:52	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Grub-dog&diff=next&oldid=78410 poor guy can't spell tongue right
2014-02-15 17:32:00	@PikFan	tongue is funny word...
2014-02-15 17:33:40	Espyo	hah
2014-02-15 17:33:44	@PikFan	also Espyo
2014-02-15 17:33:53	Espyo	hmm?
2014-02-15 17:33:58	@PikFan	remember the discussion we had about Winged Pikmin?
2014-02-15 17:34:09	Espyo	we had a few of those
2014-02-15 17:34:09	@PikFan	how will we implement this into the infoboxes?
2014-02-15 17:34:17	@PikFan	er
2014-02-15 17:34:19	@PikFan	the carrying one
2014-02-15 17:34:22	Espyo	oh
2014-02-15 17:34:47	Espyo	hm, the limit on the infobox is the minimum strength required to begin carrying the objects
2014-02-15 17:34:52	Espyo	the max carriers is...
2014-02-15 17:35:04	Espyo	hm, isn't it the same grounded or Winged?
2014-02-15 17:35:23	@PikFan	I'm not sure I follow
2014-02-15 17:36:02	Espyo	the max number represents the maximum number of grounded only Pikmin that can hold on to the object, AND the maximum number of Winged only that can hold on
2014-02-15 17:36:21	@PikFan	oh, right
2014-02-15 17:37:05	@PikFan	but Winged Pikmin aren't discovered until later in the game
2014-02-15 17:37:23	@PikFan	so it might be a good idea to include just grounded Pikmin, too
2014-02-15 17:38:06	@PikFan	so will we add a parameter for grounded + Winged?
2014-02-15 17:38:11	Espyo	...no?
2014-02-15 17:38:16	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-15 17:38:19	Espyo	the number that's there represents either grounded or Winged
2014-02-15 17:38:22	Espyo	doesn't make a difference
2014-02-15 17:38:28	Espyo	as for grounded PLUS Winged...
2014-02-15 17:38:41	Espyo	egh, we can link them to the section on [[Carrying]] that explains it?
2014-02-15 17:38:47	Espyo	I know
2014-02-15 17:38:48	Espyo	a tooltip
2014-02-15 17:38:59	@PikFan	yeah, was thinking about that
2014-02-15 17:39:32	@PikFan	...but
2014-02-15 17:39:38	Espyo	it says 30, and if you mouse-over it, it reads something like "The absolute maximum is 30 grounded Pikmin plus 14 Winged, for a total of 44."
2014-02-15 17:39:56	@PikFan	we can't put it into the infobox, or else it'll appear for other games
2014-02-15 17:40:24	@PikFan	so we'll have to go to each enemy in Pikmin 3 and manually put it in
2014-02-15 17:40:29	Espyo	I think these infoboxes need a major revamp
2014-02-15 17:40:34	Espyo	like, no | carriers = attribute
2014-02-15 17:40:46	Espyo	only | carriers1 = , | carriers2 = , etc.
2014-02-15 17:40:50	Espyo	even if we do get repeats
2014-02-15 17:40:57	@PikFan	right
2014-02-15 17:41:10	Espyo	at least it'll be clear that we have info on all applying games
2014-02-15 17:41:25	Espyo	instead of a catch-all value that could maybe belong to just one game, and we didn't double check for the other
2014-02-15 17:41:32	Espyo	also it would fix the problem we have
2014-02-15 17:41:41	Espyo	plus another problem: have you checked the likes of [[Red Bulborb]] lately?
2014-02-15 17:42:12	@PikFan	what about it?
2014-02-15 17:42:38	Espyo	check the HP section on the infobox
2014-02-15 17:43:00	@PikFan	yeah, the tooltip was a little confusing
2014-02-15 17:43:09	@PikFan	but I don't see how it's a major issue
2014-02-15 17:43:27	@PikFan	...referencing to itself is bad?
2014-02-15 17:43:50	Espyo	oh
2014-02-15 17:43:52	Espyo	...oops
2014-02-15 17:43:54	Espyo	heh, that's not it
2014-02-15 17:44:00	Espyo	I should've "linked" you to a different one
2014-02-15 17:44:03	@PikFan	oh, heh
2014-02-15 17:44:04	Espyo	yeah, that's not the point
2014-02-15 17:44:06	Espyo	the actual tooltip
2014-02-15 17:44:10	Espyo	it serves as a reference
2014-02-15 17:44:12	Espyo	all fine and dandy
2014-02-15 17:44:18	Espyo	but look at [[Pileated Snagret]] now
2014-02-15 17:44:32	@PikFan	...oh
2014-02-15 17:44:37	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-15 17:44:45	Espyo	so getting rid of | vitality = 
2014-02-15 17:44:50	@PikFan	it doesn't apply to bosses?
2014-02-15 17:44:58	Espyo	that's not it
2014-02-15 17:45:08	Espyo	there's only | vitality = on that infobox
2014-02-15 17:45:13	Espyo	so I can't write a tooltip
2014-02-15 17:45:20	Espyo	because it's ambiguous as to whether it's Pikmin 1 or 2
2014-02-15 17:45:21	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-15 17:45:28	Espyo	and having only | vitality1 = , | vitality2 = , etc. would fix that as well
2014-02-15 17:45:34	Espyo	so we really have to change this for all these infoboxes
2014-02-15 17:45:53	@PikFan	is J here
2014-02-15 17:46:10	Espyo	don't think so
2014-02-15 17:46:15	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-15 17:46:37	Spark	best name 10/10
2014-02-15 17:47:02	Spark	i wonder if S is taken
2014-02-15 17:47:17	Espyo	only takes 1 character
2014-02-15 17:47:23	Espyo	the only thing faster would be 0
2014-02-15 17:47:28	Espyo	which would completely break the server
2014-02-15 17:47:36	Spark	0 wouldnt be faster
2014-02-15 17:47:41	Spark	it's still only one character
2014-02-15 17:47:54	Spark	unless you mean 0 characters
2014-02-15 17:48:06	Spark	in which case yeah we'd all be typing his name constantly
2014-02-15 17:50:50	Espyo	 0 characters, yep
2014-02-15 17:51:28	@PikFan	ugh
2014-02-15 17:51:48	Spark	what's wrong pik?
2014-02-15 17:51:52	@PikFan	I tried | vitality2 on the Empress Bulblax, but then it disappeared
2014-02-15 17:52:09	Espyo	I think it's because | vitality1 is missing
2014-02-15 17:52:16	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-15 17:52:37	@PikFan	we need to change that
2014-02-15 17:53:11	@PikFan	and there's no way (that we know of) to get HP for enemies in Pikmin 3
2014-02-15 17:53:14	@PikFan	...is there?
2014-02-15 17:54:44	Espyo	https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheet%2Fccc%3Fkey%3D0AoVqC1jrYPrhdHlCZ3FCRDk4V29ieTdNbDRmbkttcFE%23gid%3D0
2014-02-15 17:55:46	Espyo	ah, this is richer than it was before I had seen it
2014-02-15 17:56:08	Espyo	uh... *than the last time I saw it
2014-02-15 17:56:31	Spark	are you guys messing with the code from pikmin to find information or something?
2014-02-15 17:56:39	Espyo	all the time
2014-02-15 17:56:40	Espyo	kinda
2014-02-15 17:56:49	Espyo	but that is from Pikmin 3
2014-02-15 17:56:55	Espyo	it's impossible to mess with Wii U game files at the moment
2014-02-15 17:57:03	Espyo	so those are based on studying and experimenting
2014-02-15 17:57:35	Spark	interesting
2014-02-15 17:57:55	Spark	how did you decompile the other games?
2014-02-15 17:58:51	Espyo	for Pikmin 2, no decompiling or reverse engineering is necessary
2014-02-15 17:58:56	Espyo	you just open the ISO with Dolphin
2014-02-15 17:59:00	Espyo	and the files are all there
2014-02-15 17:59:02	Espyo	plain text files
2014-02-15 17:59:07	Espyo	sometimes some values don't make sense, so that's a bother
2014-02-15 17:59:12	Espyo	but most of the time the data's just there
2014-02-15 17:59:24	Espyo	Pikmin 1 is more cryptic
2014-02-15 17:59:30	Spark	ah
2014-02-15 18:00:01	@PikFan	Espyo: "I play this game a lot. I have over 10k heavenly chips, 60 quintillion chips (that's 18 zeros), and 3 trillion CPS."
2014-02-15 18:00:01	Testyo	10 K = -263.15 Â°C / -441.67 Â°F
2014-02-15 18:01:35	Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-02-15 18:01:46	Espyo	I've seen more
2014-02-15 18:02:04	@PikFan	prior to the prisms
2014-02-15 18:02:36	Spark	are prisms a beta thing? cuz they dont exist in what im playing
2014-02-15 18:03:15	@PikFan	which version of Cookie Clicker are you playing
2014-02-15 18:03:30	Spark	the normal one
2014-02-15 18:03:58	Espyo	oh, now stuff is only unlocked after you have enough cookies to get it
2014-02-15 18:04:07	Espyo	or is it when you have at least 1 of the previous building?
2014-02-15 18:04:13	Espyo	dunno, but it might take a while until you see it on the menu
2014-02-15 18:05:04	Spark	i have over 100 antimatter converters
2014-02-15 18:05:08	@PikFan	stuff's unlocked when you get enough cookies to buy it
2014-02-15 18:05:12	Spark	so it must be the former

2014-02-15 18:29:20	pork	If the game won't even load on these consoles.
2014-02-15 18:29:22	@PikFan	Pikmin is for Nintendo home consoles
2014-02-15 18:29:35	dennis	Only on consoles at Nintendo's headquarters?
2014-02-15 18:29:37	pork	So it won't work with the Gameboy?

2014-02-15 18:32:43	@PikFan	I said home consoles, not headquarters
2014-02-15 18:32:45	pork	Yes, so the consoles are at Nintendo's home.
2014-02-15 18:32:49	dennis	Yes. These are consoles in Nintendo home (which is in their headquaters).
2014-02-15 18:32:54	pork	Exactly.
2014-02-15 18:32:54	dennis	Nintendo's home = their headquarters
2014-02-15 18:33:01	@PikFan	you make no sense
2014-02-15 18:33:13	dennis	Well, you're mean
2014-02-15 18:33:23	@PikFan	I'm not mean, I'm stating the facts
2014-02-15 18:33:37	pork	You told us they had to be located at Nintendo's home
2014-02-15 18:33:48	pork	Nintendo's home happens to be in Japan.
2014-02-15 18:33:48	@PikFan	I didn't say that
2014-02-15 18:33:51	pork	Therefore you are in Japan.
2014-02-15 18:34:15	dennis	And, it is 3:34 AM in Japan, so IDK why you are all awake.
2014-02-15 18:34:28	@PikFan	maybe reading this will help you understand http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console
2014-02-15 18:34:34	dennis	Anyhow, do any of you have any solutions for our problems? It's hard to figure out.

2014-02-15 18:37:37	dennis	Yes, we want to get our games working, but you won't help and just resort to being mean and kicking us.
2014-02-15 18:37:40	@Espyo	because your behaviour can easily trigger a spambot alert

2014-02-15 18:38:54	dennis	Yes, and we use computers located on the same network, so we have the same host.
2014-02-15 18:39:00	@Espyo	fair enough
2014-02-15 18:39:14	@Espyo	in the past, some other accounts were duplicated and joined in to advertise
2014-02-15 18:39:20	@Espyo	so your behaviour was similar, is all
2014-02-15 18:39:30	@Espyo	but even still, c'mon, we all know there's no Pikmin for the Gameboy

2014-02-15 18:48:41	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-15 18:48:46	@PikFan	and Sunscreen you missed it
2014-02-15 18:48:51	Sunscreen	what happened
2014-02-15 18:49:00	@Espyo	you can whois, but I changed a setting on Mibbit to show everybody's hostname when they log in or out
2014-02-15 18:50:18	Spark	lame trolls happened
2014-02-15 18:50:40	@PikFan	hah, if they did that in #mwchat, they'd be banned instantly
2014-02-15 18:50:46	@Espyo	they sure would
2014-02-15 18:50:49	@Espyo	I really need op here
2014-02-15 18:51:00	@Espyo	I'm here for most of the day, and when J isn't here, I'm the only one who can ban them
2014-02-15 18:51:10	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-15 18:51:21	@PikFan	ops can't use the akick code though
2014-02-15 18:51:25	@PikFan	I think...
2014-02-15 18:51:28	@PikFan	not sure
2014-02-15 18:51:38	@Espyo	I think they might
2014-02-15 18:51:44	@Espyo	but at least they can tempkick
2014-02-15 19:10:07	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2014-02-15 19:10:18	@PikFan	remember how I said you can only have 1 season at a time?
2014-02-15 19:10:25	@PikFan	well, I guess I'm wrong
2014-02-15 19:10:43	@PikFan	because I have all the Santa upgrades and then switched to other seasons
2014-02-15 19:10:50	@PikFan	but the Santa upgrades didn't go away
2014-02-15 19:11:39	@PikFan	(by all, I mean all except Santa's dominion)
2014-02-15 19:12:33	@Espyo	oh
2014-02-15 19:12:37	@Espyo	well, that's better
2014-02-15 19:12:52	@Espyo	I also have wrinklers, Final Claus and Valentine cookies
2014-02-15 19:12:55	@PikFan	so I guess switching the seasons doesn't take away your upgrades
2014-02-15 19:12:58	@Espyo	the stats say I'm on Valentine
2014-02-15 19:13:07	@Espyo	but strangely, I haven't seen reindeer yet
2014-02-15 19:13:08	@PikFan	right, since you haven't reset
2014-02-15 19:13:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-02-15 19:13:19	@Espyo	but the lack of reindeer is really weird
2014-02-15 19:13:27	@PikFan	hmmmm
2014-02-15 19:13:33	@Espyo	and I'm looking â€” while I'm working out I'm just staring at the screen waiting for them
2014-02-15 19:13:38	@Espyo	(it's not as dull as it sounds)
2014-02-15 19:13:44	@PikFan	heh
2014-02-15 19:14:20	@PikFan	maybe to get reindeer you need to reset
2014-02-15 19:14:27	@PikFan	and then switch to the Christmas season

2014-02-15 19:55:21	@PikFan	so I'm going for Neverclick, True Neverclick, and Hardcore
2014-02-15 19:55:50	@PikFan	I reset really early because I made the seasonal upgrades extremely expensive
2014-02-15 19:56:28	@Espyo	what's Hardcore again?
2014-02-15 19:56:35	@PikFan	see, as you keep switching the seasons, their upgrades become 10 times more expensive
2014-02-15 19:56:42	@Espyo	wow
2014-02-15 19:56:44	@PikFan	getting to a billion cookies with no upgrades
2014-02-15 19:57:05	@PikFan	and I didn't know that, so I inadvertently made them cost 33 quad
2014-02-15 19:57:40	@PikFan	so I think the order I'll go in is Halloween â†’ Valentine's â†’ Christmas
2014-02-15 19:57:54	@PikFan	...err
2014-02-15 19:58:01	@PikFan	I'm already at Valentines

2014-02-15 19:58:29	@PikFan	(you start out each game at Valentine's)
2014-02-15 19:59:22	@PikFan	the season I want to be active after I get all the seasonal upgrades is Christmas, because reindeer
2014-02-15 19:59:52	@Espyo	mhm
2014-02-15 20:01:11	@PikFan	someone just flooded in #mwchat
2014-02-15 20:01:25	@PikFan	an op is probably going to ban them in a moment

2014-02-15 20:01:58	@Espyo	heh
2014-02-15 20:02:00	@PikFan	after waiting 22 minutes
2014-02-15 20:04:13	@PikFan	ooooh
2014-02-15 20:04:22	@PikFan	the user was banned by DarkMyst
2014-02-15 20:04:49	@PikFan	because he said the same thing in a bunch of other channels
2014-02-15 20:05:01	@PikFan	he even did it in networks, too
2014-02-15 20:05:12	@PikFan	*in other networks
2014-02-15 20:05:23	@PikFan	...is it possible to be banned from all of IRC?

2014-02-15 20:05:56	@Espyo	spam some
2014-02-15 20:06:05	@Espyo	you'll be disconnected from the server
2014-02-15 20:06:07	BetaMaster	not all of IRC
2014-02-15 20:06:11	@Espyo	keep it up and the server might ban you outright

2014-02-15 22:42:39	Testyo	Oh, J, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 15/02/2014 12:50 (GMT), saying: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Agoombaandapikmin&curid=8386&diff=78407&oldid=73645&rcid=31966.
2014-02-15 22:43:07	@J	what even
2014-02-15 22:43:28	@J	why no revert?
2014-02-15 22:44:16	@Espyo	because we need to decide whether to ban them or not
2014-02-15 22:44:26	@PikFan	...wait what
2014-02-15 22:44:30	@PikFan	why would we ban them
2014-02-15 22:44:39	@PikFan	...oh
2014-02-15 22:44:41	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-15 22:45:10	@PikFan	couldn't we try warning him, or something
2014-02-15 22:45:31	@J	the edit would still exist
2014-02-15 22:45:54	@Espyo	we tried before already
2014-02-15 22:46:32	@PikFan	you mean this? "I have to ask, what exactly was the purpose of that page you created? On Pikipedia, user-related content must go into user spaces, and fan content must go to our sister wiki, Pikmin Fanon instead."
2014-02-15 22:47:19	@Espyo	sure do
2014-02-15 22:47:35	@PikFan	it doesn't seem like a warning
2014-02-15 22:47:40	@PikFan	more like a friendly reminder
2014-02-15 22:47:53	@PikFan	...then again, "warning" is loosely defined
2014-02-15 22:47:54	@Espyo	hence why this needs discussion
2014-02-15 22:48:36	@PikFan	on Pikmin Fanon, we have this http://www.pikminfanon.com/PikminFanon:Warning_Policy
2014-02-15 22:51:22	@PikFan	also Espyo, now would be a good time to tell J of your infobox ideas

2014-02-16 17:47:15	@J	okay, I've managed to write an RSS feed creator/updater library whose memory usage is constant of the feed size
2014-02-16 17:47:28	@J	but it's quite slow if the feed is large
2014-02-16 17:47:41	@J	(large as in > 10k items)
2014-02-16 17:47:41	Testyo	10 K = -263.15 Â°C / -441.67 Â°F
2014-02-16 17:48:48	Espyo	O(1), I believe?
2014-02-16 17:49:16	Espyo	that doesn't sound linear
2014-02-16 17:49:19	Espyo	sounds exponential
2014-02-16 17:49:33	@J	wha?
2014-02-16 17:49:48	@J	what sounds exponential, and who mentioned linear?
2014-02-16 17:51:30	Espyo	heh, big O notation
2014-02-16 17:51:38	Espyo	you said its memory usage is constant to the feed size
2014-02-16 17:51:49	Espyo	so it grows linearly
2014-02-16 17:51:59	Espyo	 30 items takes up exactly twice as much memory as 15
2014-02-16 17:52:02	Espyo	that's linear
2014-02-16 17:52:13	Espyo	but if you're saying it's slow if it's large, it sounds a bit more exponential
2014-02-16 17:53:52	@J	you're sounding very confused
2014-02-16 17:54:36	@J	maybe computer science is crazy, but linear growth generally means it's proportional to the number
2014-02-16 17:54:59	@J	as in, your 'measure' is c*n for some number c where n is your number of things
2014-02-16 17:55:28	@J	second, I mentioned 2 completely separate measures: memory usage and time taken
2014-02-16 17:55:49	@J	memory usage is constant of the size, time taken is very probably linera
2014-02-16 17:55:51	@J	*linear
2014-02-16 17:56:08	Espyo	I didn't read the time taken part
2014-02-16 17:56:09	@J	not sure why you'd say 'slow when large' means exponential
2014-02-16 17:56:16	@J	that's kind of a crazy leap
2014-02-16 17:56:20	Espyo	I didn't say "means", I said "feels"
2014-02-16 17:56:28	Espyo	uh, "sounds"
2014-02-16 17:56:44	Espyo	but yeah, is it flexible?
2014-02-16 17:56:47	@J	well, still the same
2014-02-16 17:56:51	@J	not sure why you'd say 'slow when large' sounds exponential
2014-02-16 17:57:12	@J	all it should tell you is that it's monotonic (if we can use that word here)
2014-02-16 17:57:21	@J	is what flexible?
2014-02-16 18:10:38	@J	but yeah, there aren't really any streaming XML editors
2014-02-16 18:10:58	@J	so I have to copy the feed, updating it as I go
2014-02-16 18:11:03	@J	which obviously takes a while
2014-02-16 18:11:23	@J	I could probably hack something faster, but it would take a while
2014-02-16 18:11:53	@J	and isn't really that important - as long as it doesn't crash the program, it's fair enough for it to take a while if your feed is getting out of hand
2014-02-16 19:08:32	Espyo	...it has one tone?
2014-02-16 19:08:47	Espyo	right
2014-02-16 19:12:38	@J	no, that's monotone
2014-02-16 19:12:40	@J	...maybe

2014-02-16 20:43:45	@PikFan	since I have 4.6 quint in the bank
2014-02-16 20:43:48	@PikFan	guess not

2014-02-16 20:45:24	@PikFan	(antimatter condenser)
2014-02-16 20:45:32	IDontNeedANickname	I know what those are
2014-02-16 20:45:38	IDontNeedANickname	I've played cookie clicker
2014-02-16 20:45:39	@PikFan	oh, ok
2014-02-16 20:45:45	@PikFan	right
2014-02-16 20:46:14	@PikFan	Espyo: you said 50 quint in wrinklers?
2014-02-16 20:46:29	@PikFan	...how long were your wrinklers sucking for?
2014-02-16 20:47:30	Espyo	a whole day
2014-02-16 20:47:39	Espyo	maybe 50 quint is overly exagerated
2014-02-16 20:47:41	Espyo	*exaggerated
2014-02-16 20:47:45	Espyo	but more than a quint for sure
2014-02-16 20:47:49	Espyo	like... 10
2014-02-16 20:47:54	@PikFan	nice
2014-02-16 20:47:59	Espyo	I used to get half a quint from wrinklers
2014-02-16 20:48:02	Espyo	before the update
2014-02-16 20:48:08	@PikFan	ooh
2014-02-16 20:48:17	Espyo	now that I bought a load of things from the update, my CpS basically duodeplified
2014-02-16 20:48:18	IDontNeedANickname	What are Wrinklers?
2014-02-16 20:48:20	Espyo	(that's a word now)
2014-02-16 20:48:25	IDontNeedANickname	I've never seen them in cookie clicker
2014-02-16 20:48:28	Espyo	so 10 quint sounds about right
2014-02-16 20:48:42	Espyo	they were introduced in the halloween update
2014-02-16 20:48:49	Espyo	and appear kinda halfway through into the game
2014-02-16 20:49:05	Espyo	and now you need a LOT to even unlock them
2014-02-16 20:49:07	Espyo	much less make them appear
2014-02-16 20:49:19	@PikFan	wait what
2014-02-16 20:49:30	Espyo	hmm... "duodecaled"?
2014-02-16 20:49:38	Espyo	what's "multiplied by 20" anyway?
2014-02-16 20:49:48	@PikFan	are the Grandmapocalypse upgrades more expensive?
2014-02-16 20:50:22	@PikFan	"the Grandmapocalypse now spawns wrinklers, hideous elderly creatures that damage your CpS when they reach your big cookie. Thankfully, you can click on them to make them explode (you'll even gain back the cookies they've swallowed - with interest!)."

2014-02-16 20:51:12	IDontNeedANickname	FLAPPY BIRD
2014-02-16 20:51:33	@PikFan	didn't Nintendo sue the creator of Flappy Bird
2014-02-16 20:51:42	IDontNeedANickname	I don't think so
2014-02-16 20:51:54	IDontNeedANickname	I'm pretty sure the creator took it down for some other reason
2014-02-16 20:51:56	@PikFan	mm
2014-02-16 20:51:57	IDontNeedANickname	But maybe
2014-02-16 20:52:17	@PikFan	let's see
2014-02-16 20:52:37	@PikFan	I should let my wrinklers suck until 2:00 PST

2014-02-17 18:56:21	Espyo	hey
2014-02-17 18:57:35	@PikFan	so I /think/ I'll be able to get the Molecular maestro achievement before resetting
2014-02-17 18:57:59	@PikFan	I still need ~27 quint for 15k
2014-02-17 18:57:59	Testyo	15 K = -258.15 Â°C / -432.67 Â°F
2014-02-17 18:58:21	@PikFan	and I've already got 140 ACs
2014-02-17 18:59:11	@PikFan	also I heard that you need a million HCs to buy 200 of each building
2014-02-17 18:59:43	@PikFan	er...
2014-02-17 18:59:48	@PikFan	not necessarily need
2014-02-17 19:00:01	@PikFan	but have by the time you buy them all
2014-02-17 19:00:30	@PikFan	and I guess they're right, because 1M HCs needs 500,000,500,000,000,000,000,000 cookies
2014-02-17 19:00:31	Testyo	1 m = 1.0936 yd / 3.2808 ft / 52.6316 Olimar-heights / 166.666 TRY-heights
2014-02-17 19:00:58	@PikFan	...what does TRY height mean, again?
2014-02-17 19:03:00	Espyo	heh, in-joke somewhere else
2014-02-17 19:03:10	Espyo	Molecular maestro...
2014-02-17 19:03:11	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-17 19:03:28	Espyo	oh, that'll take a tad
2014-02-17 19:04:09	@PikFan	how many cookies have you baked all time?
2014-02-17 19:04:23	@PikFan	85,157,276,642,596,450,000
2014-02-17 19:05:10	@PikFan	I predict I'll be in the sextillions within a week
2014-02-17 19:05:33	@PikFan	...ok, maybe that's TOO hopeful
2014-02-17 19:06:34	Espyo	 23,935,233,844,326,580,000
2014-02-17 19:06:43	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-17 19:06:54	Espyo	haven't been following GC actively
2014-02-17 19:07:13	@PikFan	GC?
2014-02-17 19:07:19	@PikFan	don't you mean CC
2014-02-17 19:07:45	@PikFan	anyway
2014-02-17 19:07:45	Espyo	Golden Cookies
2014-02-17 19:07:52	@PikFan	oh, right
2014-02-17 19:09:30	@PikFan	...something's not right
2014-02-17 19:10:09	@PikFan	so I calculated what the wrinklers would give me if the CpS was undisturbed for 14 hours
2014-02-17 19:10:24	@PikFan	they would give me 10 quint
2014-02-17 19:11:03	@PikFan	but yesterday, you said that you had wrinklers that would have given you 10 quint
2014-02-17 19:11:16	@PikFan	and your CpS is less than mine
2014-02-17 19:11:51	@PikFan	........
2014-02-17 19:12:00	Espyo	my bad
2014-02-17 19:12:00	@PikFan	I'm an idiot
2014-02-17 19:12:04	Espyo	my calculations were wrong
2014-02-17 19:12:23	@PikFan	you still click some GCs, right?
2014-02-17 19:12:33	Espyo	I grossly overestimated â€” I only got 3 quints from them yesterday
2014-02-17 19:12:37	Espyo	yeah, occasionally
2014-02-17 19:12:44	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-17 19:12:52	Espyo	if it's a workout day, I click the ones I see on-screen between exericses
2014-02-17 19:12:58	Espyo	*exercises
2014-02-17 19:13:01	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2014-02-17 19:13:08	Espyo	(provided I don't feel like breaking my momentum)
2014-02-17 19:13:15	Espyo	but other days I click like one or two
2014-02-17 19:13:24	@PikFan	mm
2014-02-17 19:24:39	@PikFan	"I want a Golden Cookies upgrade called Solid Gold and it's an Alchemy Lab upgrade, it makes Golden Cookies spawn four times as frequently, but you need 250 Alchemy Labs for it. It costs 77,777,777,777,777 cookies "
2014-02-17 19:24:53	@PikFan	ok, 77 tril is way too cheap
2014-02-17 19:25:09	@PikFan	maybe make it like 7 quint
2014-02-17 19:26:46	@PikFan	...but 250 ALs cost 1.992 sextillion
2014-02-17 19:27:53	Espyo	but 250 ALsâ€” yep

2014-02-17 21:37:32	Espyo	hm, maybe it was taken, though
2014-02-17 21:37:36	Espyo	there are wikias of everything
2014-02-17 21:37:39	Espyo	there's one for /water/

2014-02-17 21:40:35	BetaMaster	there's one for spam

2014-02-17 21:48:29	BetaMaster	sounds a lot like Google

2014-02-17 21:49:25	Espyo	G+
2014-02-17 21:50:00	@PikFan	then again, I don't use Google too much
2014-02-17 21:50:08	@PikFan	other than searching
2014-02-17 21:50:14	BetaMaster	youtube kindly gave me 6 google+ accounts
2014-02-17 21:50:20	BetaMaster	every time I opt to disconnect
2014-02-17 21:50:33	BetaMaster	it reconnects in 15 days, giving me another account
2014-02-17 21:50:49	@J	very generous of them
2014-02-17 21:50:54	@PikFan	when I use YT, I make sure that I'm not logged in
2014-02-17 21:50:54	BetaMaster	indeed
2014-02-17 21:51:08	Espyo	that sounds incredibly broken
2014-02-17 21:51:11	Espyo	i.e. normalish
2014-02-17 21:52:04	BetaMaster	and they kinda broke youtube
2014-02-17 21:52:04	BetaMaster	can't even skip around in videos anymore
2014-02-17 21:52:04	BetaMaster	without it crashing adobe
2014-02-17 21:52:41	BetaMaster	that might just be my computer though I guess
2014-02-17 21:56:44	Espyo	I can skip
2014-02-17 21:56:52	Espyo	but 99 times out of 100, it doesn't do anything
2014-02-17 21:56:56	Espyo	just stays loading forever
2014-02-17 21:57:02	Espyo	I can skip just fine with VLC, though
2014-02-17 21:58:08	Espyo	also recently, I've been trying loads of times to upload a Brawl video
2014-02-17 21:58:15	Espyo	it keeps playing back at 12fps
2014-02-17 21:58:23	Espyo	all other videos play just fine
2014-02-17 21:58:30	Espyo	and apparently other people are having the problem too
2014-02-17 21:58:37	Espyo	...but I guess not enough for youtube to take action
2014-02-17 22:02:04	Espyo	bleh, third upload, still horribly choppy

2014-02-17 22:47:26	Espyo	ah yes
2014-02-17 23:07:39	@PikFan	"I cannot understand why Bicentennial is not a shadow achievement. Unfair achievements have been in the past and most of them are easier or more achievable than this."
2014-02-17 23:07:54	@PikFan	yeah, it should be a shadow achievement
2014-02-17 23:09:02	Espyo	erm, which one is that?
2014-02-17 23:09:16	@PikFan	the one with 200 of each building
2014-02-17 23:09:35	Espyo	oh
2014-02-17 23:09:36	Espyo	right
2014-02-17 23:09:40	Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-02-17 23:09:49	Espyo	but again, it gives the game purpose for those that already 100% i

2014-02-17 23:09:58	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-17 23:10:09	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-17 23:10:22	@PikFan	maybe you should try going for some of the shadow achievements
2014-02-17 23:10:34	Espyo	I have 2
2014-02-17 23:10:44	Espyo	both on accident
2014-02-17 23:10:56	@PikFan	Just plain lucky and True Neverclick, right?
2014-02-17 23:10:56	Espyo	True Neverclick, because I thought the requirements for Neverclick were True Neverclick's
2014-02-17 23:11:00	Espyo	and Justâ€” yeah
2014-02-17 23:11:13	@PikFan	I have those and Hardcore
2014-02-17 23:12:17	@PikFan	hmm, dunno if I should try going for the Speed Bake ones
2014-02-17 23:12:32	@PikFan	Speed Bake I and II I can get, but...
2014-02-17 23:12:37	@PikFan	don't know about III
2014-02-17 23:16:54	Espyo	don't think I even want to try
2014-02-17 23:17:03	Espyo	if only HC could partake into it...
2014-02-17 23:17:35	@PikFan	I probably should have done it before the 1.041 update
2014-02-17 23:17:49	@PikFan	when reindeer were at the start
2014-02-17 23:19:58	Espyo	yeah

2014-02-20 16:01:15	MeisterTehMadman	Pikmin Fanon just went through a change yesterday
2014-02-20 16:01:23	MeisterTehMadman	Sort of
2014-02-20 16:02:19	Espyo	oh?
2014-02-20 16:02:20	MeisterTehMadman	And I'm also hooked on cookie clicker
2014-02-20 16:02:22	Espyo	what happened?
2014-02-20 16:02:34	Espyo	hehe yeah, it's pretty addictive
2014-02-20 16:02:56	MeisterTehMadman	PikFan left the Guild of Bulborbs
2014-02-20 16:03:08	MeisterTehMadman	He left his role of spotty Bulbear to peach Bulborb
2014-02-20 16:03:20	Espyo	oh
2014-02-20 16:03:23	Espyo	what does that imply?
2014-02-20 16:03:29	Espyo	he's no longer an admin?
2014-02-20 16:03:36	MeisterTehMadman	Nononono
2014-02-20 16:03:44	MeisterTehMadman	He's still an admin
2014-02-20 16:03:50	Espyo	oh
2014-02-20 16:03:52	Espyo	phew
2014-02-20 16:04:13	MeisterTehMadman	It's just that now peach Bulborb isn't a snow Bulborb in the guild now...
2014-02-20 16:04:44	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-20 16:05:07	MeisterTehMadman	And I guess that implies that now I'm the leader of the snow Bulborb guild :)
2014-02-20 16:05:16	MeisterTehMadman	Gah too many cookies
2014-02-20 16:05:35	MeisterTehMadman	I'm sitting at my computer clicking these cookies like a madman
2014-02-20 16:06:33	MeisterTehMadman	Only 4.4 billion though
2014-02-20 16:07:58	Espyo	hehe
2014-02-20 16:08:03	Espyo	heavenly cookies will help
2014-02-20 16:08:09	MeisterTehMadman	Just bought my second antimatter condenser
2014-02-20 16:08:15	MeisterTehMadman	What are heavenly cookies?
2014-02-20 16:08:25	Espyo	when you reset the game and go back to 0 upgrades, 0 cookies
2014-02-20 16:08:29	Espyo	you get heavenly cookies insead
2014-02-20 16:08:30	Espyo	*instead
2014-02-20 16:08:45	Espyo	just having these in your inventory speeds up cookie production tremendously
2014-02-20 16:08:54	Espyo	how many you receive depends on how many cookies you baked before resetting
2014-02-20 16:08:58	MeisterTehMadman	Oh
2014-02-20 16:09:42	MeisterTehMadman	I'm not doing that now

2014-02-21 21:17:57	Espyo	thanks
2014-02-21 21:18:07	Espyo	I messed around with it a bit
2014-02-21 21:18:12	Espyo	that's as best as I can make it
2014-02-21 21:19:32	PikFan	mm
2014-02-21 21:19:46	PikFan	I noticed you put the fruits in alpha order
2014-02-21 21:20:14	PikFan	my OCD says to put them in a different order
2014-02-21 21:20:19	PikFan	maybe I could do that
2014-02-21 21:20:31	Espyo	woah pointers of pointers
2014-02-21 21:20:35	Espyo	what order?
2014-02-21 21:20:46	PikFan	oh
2014-02-21 21:20:53	Spark	yeah im trying to make it be an array of pointers basically
2014-02-21 21:20:58	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-21 21:21:17	PikFan	the "official" order would be the Prima guide
2014-02-21 21:21:25	Espyo	hm, can't really see anything immediately wrong
2014-02-21 21:21:35	Espyo	can you debug your code?
2014-02-21 21:21:39	Espyo	run it step by step
2014-02-21 21:21:42	Spark	i did
2014-02-21 21:21:52	Espyo	PikFan: yeah, which is not really all that official...
2014-02-21 21:22:02	Espyo	there is no real order, so I went with alphabetical
2014-02-21 21:22:12	Espyo	at least your picture and the one from wikia have a different order
2014-02-21 21:22:32	Spark	i get an error at line 13, which is  *sprites = &sprite;
2014-02-21 21:23:16	PikFan	hence the quotes
2014-02-21 21:23:26	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-21 21:23:36	PikFan	but eh
2014-02-21 21:23:36	Espyo	well, sprites is an array of sprites
2014-02-21 21:23:41	Espyo	whereas sprite is a single sprite
2014-02-21 21:23:41	PikFan	it isn't important
2014-02-21 21:23:50	Espyo	your assigning a single sprite to a vector
2014-02-21 21:24:04	Espyo	*you're
2014-02-21 21:24:47	PikFan	also, for fruits that return from Pikmin 2, should I add their icon to their P3 infoboxes?
2014-02-21 21:24:59	Espyo	yep
2014-02-21 21:25:10	Espyo	also create [[Fruit File]], would you?
2014-02-21 21:25:17	PikFan	okay
2014-02-21 21:25:23	Espyo	I'm not sure if you should add a list of fruits as well or not
2014-02-21 21:25:24	PikFan	I can't atm; at school
2014-02-21 21:25:30	Espyo	like we have on [[Treasure Hoard]]
2014-02-21 21:25:31	Espyo	oh, it's fine
2014-02-21 21:25:48	PikFan	but I've already fixed a few of the pages
2014-02-21 21:25:58	Espyo	on one hand, we already discussed whether to create [[enemy]] and split from [[Piklopedia]] or not
2014-02-21 21:26:06	PikFan	I say split
2014-02-21 21:26:24	PikFan	...oh, thought we need to
2014-02-21 21:26:24	Espyo	I say so too
2014-02-21 21:26:29	Espyo	but now's not the time to discuss it
2014-02-21 21:26:31	Espyo	hehe
2014-02-21 21:26:33	PikFan	but yeah, split
2014-02-21 21:26:49	PikFan	and I need to go now, bye

2014-02-21 21:27:39	Espyo	this is the chatroom for both Pikmin wikis

2014-02-21 21:27:51	Spark	ive never even played pikmin :P

2014-02-21 21:28:14	Espyo	the games are really fun
2014-02-21 21:28:27	Spark	so im gonna edit pikipedia so im not exclusively a code-pestering nuisance; im sure theres some work that i can do that doesnt require knowledge of the game
2014-02-21 21:28:37	Espyo	haha
2014-02-21 21:28:40	Espyo	actually, there is some

2014-02-21 21:28:52	Espyo	well, you have to "not hate it"
2014-02-21 21:36:34	Spark	also i tried replacing the error causing line with     sprites[0] = &sprite;
2014-02-21 21:36:56	Spark	in theory that should fix it, right? cuz its not :(
2014-02-21 21:37:06	Espyo	same error still?
2014-02-21 21:37:07	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-21 21:37:27	Espyo	 /technically/, the way you had before would work
2014-02-21 21:37:32	Espyo	but it's a hacky way to do it
2014-02-21 21:38:14	Espyo	sprites = new sf::Sprite*[spriteno];
2014-02-21 21:38:19	Espyo	I'm surprised at how that compiles
2014-02-21 21:39:47	Spark	what's wrong with that?
2014-02-21 21:39:54	Spark	is there some other way?
2014-02-21 21:43:17	Espyo	I can't even understand what you're doing there
2014-02-21 21:43:34	Espyo	like, I don't get the "*[spriteno]" part
2014-02-21 21:43:47	Spark	its a double pointer
2014-02-21 21:43:50	Espyo	I have to be honest, I don't mess about with pointer-style arrays that often, I rather use STD vectors
2014-02-21 21:43:54	Spark	and im double deferencing it
2014-02-21 21:44:20	Espyo	but you're calling a sprite instead of specifying what class or struct it shouild be
2014-02-21 21:44:22	Espyo	*should
2014-02-21 21:44:25	Espyo	I see the "new" there
2014-02-21 21:44:33	Espyo	after a "new", a class or struct name comes
2014-02-21 21:45:02	Spark	wait what i said was wrong
2014-02-21 21:45:09	Spark	what im doing is making a new double pointer
2014-02-21 21:45:39	Spark	if i did new sf::sprite [spriteno] it would make a single pointer, right?
2014-02-21 21:45:54	Spark	so the extra * makes it a double pointer, i think
2014-02-21 21:46:34	Espyo	n-no...
2014-02-21 21:46:40	Espyo	new sf::Sprite*
2014-02-21 21:46:43	Espyo	that's a single pointer
2014-02-21 21:46:48	Espyo	actually
2014-02-21 21:46:51	Espyo	that's a double pointer
2014-02-21 21:47:04	Espyo	that turns sprites into a pointer of a pointer of an sf::Sprite
2014-02-21 21:47:15	Espyo	I really don't see how the [spriteno] fits
2014-02-21 21:48:07	Spark	thats the number of sprites in the array
2014-02-21 21:48:49	Espyo	fair enough, but it shouldn't go into the new statement
2014-02-21 21:49:03	Espyo	that's like saying a = new 4
2014-02-21 21:49:28	Spark	http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/dynamic/
2014-02-21 21:49:31	Espyo	unless I'm missing something deadly obvious...
2014-02-21 21:49:44	Espyo	UGH
2014-02-21 21:49:46	Espyo	of course
2014-02-21 21:49:48	Spark	int * foo; foo = new int [5]; is valid code, according to that
2014-02-21 21:49:56	Espyo	right
2014-02-21 21:49:59	Espyo	geez
2014-02-21 21:50:03	Espyo	of course, of course, it's right
2014-02-21 21:50:08	Espyo	laksdlahsd
2014-02-21 21:50:18	Espyo	in that case, try:
2014-02-21 21:50:24	Spark	i was right about something o3o
2014-02-21 21:50:29	Espyo	sprites = new (sf::Sprite*)[spriteno];
2014-02-21 21:50:45	Espyo	maybe it makes a difference, maybe it doesn't
2014-02-21 21:50:50	Espyo	but one thing's for sure, it's less complicated
2014-02-21 21:50:56	Espyo	but yeah, sometimes it makes a difference
2014-02-21 21:50:58	Spark	parenthesis are always good
2014-02-21 21:51:00	Espyo	ok, rest of the code...
2014-02-21 21:51:18	Spark	*parentheses
2014-02-21 21:52:06	Espyo	also, before setting new, you should first delete
2014-02-21 21:52:16	Espyo	if you're just doing something random, it doesn't matter
2014-02-21 21:52:29	Espyo	but when you want to program something for real, you have to delete everything you allocate
2014-02-21 21:52:47	Espyo	in this case, before that new statement we were talking about, have "delete sprites;"
2014-02-21 21:52:50	Espyo	I think that's enough
2014-02-21 21:52:54	Spark	i was going to add code to delete it at the end of the program
2014-02-21 21:53:05	Spark	if i deleted the sprites then it would be pointless
2014-02-21 21:53:23	Spark	the idea is to have an array of every sprite in the program, and then use a for loop to draw each one
2014-02-21 21:53:29	Espyo	yeah, but
2014-02-21 21:53:42	Espyo	that's not what it's going to do
2014-02-21 21:53:47	Espyo	you have a list of sprites, sprite
2014-02-21 21:53:52	Espyo	when a new one is created
2014-02-21 21:53:58	Espyo	you say that sprites is equal to a brand new list of sprites
2014-02-21 21:54:10	Espyo	the old ones are gone, the old array
2014-02-21 21:54:17	Espyo	maybe that's also why it's not working
2014-02-21 21:54:32	Espyo	you have to create a new array on a temporary variable, of the new size
2014-02-21 21:54:38	Espyo	copy all existing sprites over onto that array
2014-02-21 21:54:43	Espyo	and then delete the old one (optional)
2014-02-21 21:54:51	Espyo	and finally, assign sprites to point to the new array
2014-02-21 21:55:25	Spark	makes sense
2014-02-21 21:55:36	Spark	but wouldnt the new array be deleted at the end of the function?
2014-02-21 21:56:03	Espyo	no, because it's a pointer
2014-02-21 21:56:08	Espyo	if you say int a;
2014-02-21 21:56:17	Espyo	at the end of the function, that a is gone
2014-02-21 21:56:26	Espyo	but int* a = new int;
2014-02-21 21:56:35	Espyo	you actively reserved some space in the program's memory for a new int
2014-02-21 21:56:44	Espyo	when you get out of the function, the pointer is gone
2014-02-21 21:56:49	Espyo	but the reserved space is still there
2014-02-21 21:57:04	Spark	oh okay
2014-02-21 21:57:11	Espyo	int* a = new int;
2014-02-21 21:57:27	Espyo	a is worth &12345678, points to a 0
2014-02-21 21:57:31	Espyo	*a = 6
2014-02-21 21:57:37	Espyo	a is worth &12345678, points to a 6
2014-02-21 21:57:51	Espyo	the function ends, a is gone, but &12345678 is still worth 6
2014-02-21 21:57:59	Espyo	and meanwhile, if you have a global variable that's a pointer
2014-02-21 21:58:05	Espyo	you could always do my_global = a
2014-02-21 21:58:16	Espyo	and my global would be worth &1235678, pointing to the 6
2014-02-21 21:58:25	Espyo	so that might be the reason it's crashing
2014-02-21 21:58:33	Espyo	you create a new array, with nothing in it
2014-02-21 21:58:46	Espyo	either zeroes or trash, depending on whether you're running in debug mode or not
2014-02-21 21:58:50	Espyo	(depends on the compiler too)
2014-02-21 21:59:01	Espyo	so when it's time to draw, it's probably crashing for trying to draw garbage
2014-02-21 21:59:21	Spark	hoo this is confusing but i think i understand
2014-02-21 21:59:26	Spark	thank yeh
2014-02-21 21:59:40	Espyo	a pointer is really that, something that points to a space in the computer's memory
2014-02-21 21:59:54	Espyo	understanding exactly what pointers are is really fundamental
2014-02-21 22:00:00	Espyo	in high school, they didn't teach us that well
2014-02-21 22:00:04	Espyo	and most people failed at that subject
2014-02-21 22:00:06	Espyo	I had a hard time as well
2014-02-21 22:00:17	Espyo	when I stopped to think about what pointers were really, it became a whole lot easier
2014-02-21 22:00:25	Espyo	they literally contain the &12345678 I meantioned
2014-02-21 22:00:27	Espyo	*mentioned
2014-02-21 22:00:35	Espyo	they literally contain a number that points to something in the computer's memory
2014-02-21 22:00:44	Spark	im actually about to start taking a programming class
2014-02-21 22:00:49	Spark	my first one o:
2014-02-21 22:00:53	Espyo	that's great
2014-02-21 22:26:26	Spark	wait when i do what you suggested
2014-02-21 22:26:37	Spark	does sprites still have to be a sf::Sprite **
2014-02-21 22:26:43	Spark	or can it just be one *
2014-02-21 22:30:06	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-21 22:30:10	Espyo	I believe it is just one star
2014-02-21 22:30:29	Espyo	yeah, just one
2014-02-21 22:31:02	Espyo	you're saying you want an array (that's the "[spriteno]" part), of pointers to Sprites ("Sprite*" part)
2014-02-21 22:40:30	Spark	http://pastebin.com/PZPFeAGc
2014-02-21 22:44:10	Espyo	no no
2014-02-21 22:44:30	Espyo	by saying delete tempSprites, you're saying you want to delete content allocated somewhere
2014-02-21 22:44:36	Espyo	the where is wherever tempSprites is pointing
2014-02-21 22:44:47	Espyo	and tempSprites is pointing exactly in the same place as the new array
2014-02-21 22:45:13	Espyo	you want to delete sprites, before adding to it
2014-02-21 22:45:16	Espyo	wait
2014-02-21 22:45:17	Espyo	uh, rather
2014-02-21 22:45:26	Espyo	you want to save something like oldSprites
2014-02-21 22:45:31	Espyo	and make that point to the current array
2014-02-21 22:45:35	Espyo	then, do business as normal
2014-02-21 22:45:46	Espyo	and at the end, you want to delete the old array, which is pointed at by oldSprites
2014-02-21 22:46:06	Espyo	either way, you may want to comment the delete line for now
2014-02-21 22:46:09	Espyo	to not overcomplicate
2014-02-21 22:46:25	Espyo	deleting stuff you allocate (with new) is only really necessary to avoid hogging up resources
2014-02-21 22:46:44	Espyo	and unless your game is allocating hundreds of megabytes each time, you really don't have to worry
2014-02-21 22:46:51	Espyo	just add the deletions when you're comfortable
2014-02-21 22:53:37	Spark	okay that worked
2014-02-21 22:53:43	Spark	but now i have a new problem
2014-02-21 22:54:05	Spark	it doesnt draw any changes i make to the sprite after the constructor
2014-02-21 22:54:20	Spark	because the array contains a copy of the sprite, not a pointer to the sprite itself
2014-02-21 22:55:08	Espyo	uh, weird
2014-02-21 22:55:35	Espyo	also
2014-02-21 22:55:39	Espyo	off-topic, but
2014-02-21 22:55:45	Espyo	when you do i = i + 1
2014-02-21 22:55:49	Espyo	just do i++ :P
2014-02-21 22:55:59	Espyo	also another minor thing
2014-02-21 22:56:05	Espyo	this isn't standard, but I think it's a good idea
2014-02-21 22:56:19	Espyo	for these iterator variables, give them a descriptive letter instead of i or j
2014-02-21 22:56:23	Espyo	in this case, s, for sprite
2014-02-21 23:10:05	Spark	ok mind if i bother you one more time >_<
2014-02-21 23:11:10	Espyo	sure
2014-02-21 23:11:41	Spark	http://pastebin.com/1mPcv3WJ
2014-02-21 23:12:11	Spark	i tried doing that to make it be an actual pointer to the sprite itself, rather than a copy of it
2014-02-21 23:12:33	Spark	but now it crashes and has an even less helpful error message
2014-02-21 23:14:28	Espyo	tempSprites[i] = sprites[i];
2014-02-21 23:14:32	Espyo	should really work...
2014-02-21 23:15:00	Espyo	oh
2014-02-21 23:15:04	Espyo	sprites = &tempSprites
2014-02-21 23:15:17	Espyo	what you say here is that sprites is equal to tempSprite's address
2014-02-21 23:15:33	Espyo	tempSprite is a variable (a pointer), and like any variable, it has some address
2014-02-21 23:15:40	Espyo	you're giving it that
2014-02-21 23:15:47	Espyo	so sprites is just pointing at the pointer in this case
2014-02-21 23:15:55	Spark	isnt that what i want?
2014-02-21 23:16:00	Espyo	instead of pointing at the new array (which is inside tempSprites)
2014-02-21 23:16:05	Espyo	you're pointing to the actual sprite
2014-02-21 23:16:15	Espyo	*pointing to the actual pointer
2014-02-21 23:16:25	Espyo	let's put it like this
2014-02-21 23:16:44	Espyo	you wrote on a piece of paper "kitchen drawer", and on the kitchen drawer, there's a paper that says "eggs"
2014-02-21 23:16:54	Espyo	when you actually wanted the first paper to say "eggs" (shopping list)
2014-02-21 23:16:58	Espyo	a pointer is a paper
2014-02-21 23:17:04	Espyo	an address is its location
2014-02-21 23:17:18	Espyo	but yeah, sprites = tempSprites
2014-02-21 23:17:28	Espyo	remember, sprites is a pointer
2014-02-21 23:17:40	Spark	that gives me an error:
2014-02-21 23:17:47	Spark	note: cannot convert 'sf::Sprite*' to 'sf::Sprite**' in assignment|
2014-02-21 23:17:48	Espyo	compile-time?
2014-02-21 23:17:54	Spark	yep
2014-02-21 23:18:06	Espyo	oh, uh
2014-02-21 23:18:12	Espyo	tempSprites should be sf::Sprite**
2014-02-21 23:18:16	Espyo	just like our sprites is 
2014-02-21 23:18:53	Espyo	both sprites and tempSprites are meant to be arrays, so pointers of pointers
2014-02-21 23:19:06	Espyo	you're saying tempSprites is just a single pointer
2014-02-21 23:19:23	Spark	now     tempSprites[(spriteno-1)]=sprite; has an error
2014-02-21 23:19:49	Spark	wait
2014-02-21 23:19:57	Spark	waiiiit i fixed it
2014-02-21 23:20:00	Spark	YESSS IT WORKS
2014-02-21 23:20:05	Espyo	everything working for real?
2014-02-21 23:21:00	Spark	...nope.
2014-02-21 23:21:09	Spark	neveeeermind.
2014-02-21 23:21:50	Espyo	:(
2014-02-21 23:21:55	Spark	oh wait no nevermind the nevermind
2014-02-21 23:22:03	Spark	i got it working =3
2014-02-21 23:22:06	Spark	thank you so much
2014-02-21 23:22:07	Espyo	lol
2014-02-21 23:22:10	Espyo	you're welcome
2014-02-21 23:22:22	Espyo	but yeah, you may wanna use std::vector from now on
2014-02-21 23:22:32	Espyo	see the headaches pointer arrays create?
2014-02-21 23:22:41	Spark	yeah o.o
2014-02-21 23:22:53	Espyo	with vectors everything's instantaneous
2014-02-21 23:23:11	Espyo	std::vector<sf::Sprite*> sprites
2014-02-21 23:23:37	Espyo	when you want to add a new one, just do sprites.push_back(sprite);
2014-02-21 23:23:39	Espyo	that's literally it
2014-02-21 23:23:51	Espyo	no news, no deletes, no copying stuff from a temp one to another...
2014-02-21 23:24:05	Spark	oh speaking of deletes
2014-02-21 23:24:10	Espyo	and accessing is just the same, sprites[0], sprites[1], sprites[spriteno-1], ...
2014-02-21 23:24:17	Spark	when can i delete tempsprites and sprites
2014-02-21 23:24:23	Spark	at the end of the program?
2014-02-21 23:24:37	Espyo	you have to delete the old sprites before you copy stuff over
2014-02-21 23:24:48	Espyo	like, if you have 3 sprites and want to add a 4th
2014-02-21 23:25:09	Espyo	the array with 3 sprites gets left in &1234, then you create everything anew in &5678
2014-02-21 23:25:19	Espyo	and the one in &1234 with 3 spaces is left there forever, hogging memory
2014-02-21 23:25:37	Espyo	as for the rest, you can delete it at the end of the program, but nobody ever really does it...
2014-02-21 23:25:47	Espyo	because the operative system already cleans everything for you
2014-02-21 23:25:51	Espyo	unless you're running on PotatoOs
2014-02-21 23:26:34	Spark	i tried putting delete sprites;
2014-02-21 23:26:36	Spark	    tempSprites = new sf::Sprite*[spriteno];     delete sprites;     for (int i=0; i<spriteno-1; i++)     {         tempSprites[i]=sprites[i];     }
2014-02-21 23:26:44	Spark	it made it crash :s
2014-02-21 23:27:31	Espyo	because when you say tempSprites[i] = sprites[i]
2014-02-21 23:27:37	Espyo	nothing exists in sprites[i], it was deleted
2014-02-21 23:27:46	Espyo	you want to delete it after you're done passing
2014-02-21 23:27:52	Espyo	and before you say sprites = tempSprites
2014-02-21 23:28:05	Spark	ohhh
2014-02-21 23:28:38	Spark	that makes a lot more sense
2014-02-21 23:28:41	Spark	and actually works
2014-02-21 23:29:43	Espyo	there we go
2014-02-21 23:29:46	Espyo	no more problems
2014-02-21 23:29:47	Espyo	...for now

2014-02-22 16:59:07	@Espyo	but more than "right or wrong", I don't quite agree with using "he welcomes"
2014-02-22 16:59:19	@Espyo	"would be welcomed" would sound a lot better
2014-02-22 17:02:10	@J	meh, I don't think wording on pages like this is especially important
2014-02-22 17:02:26	@J	but sure, if you're going to go there, that would probably work better
2014-02-22 17:02:31	@J	or just 'are welcome'
2014-02-22 17:03:41	@J	oh, and I'm not using my standard setup since lots of things died
2014-02-22 17:03:51	@J	just did a quick install to a small flash drive thingy
2014-02-22 17:03:59	@J	and finally got around to ordering a desktop
2014-02-22 17:04:57	@Espyo	wait, the new hard drive didn't fix anything?
2014-02-22 17:05:05	@J	for a while...
2014-02-22 17:05:10	@Espyo	nuts
2014-02-22 17:05:16	@Espyo	motherboard?
2014-02-22 17:05:18	@J	but it seems there's more wrong than just that, or something
2014-02-22 17:05:21	@J	I don't know
2014-02-22 17:05:30	@J	everything still kind of works, but not especially well
2014-02-22 17:05:49	@J	maybe temperature-related, but not affecting the CPU somehow
2014-02-22 17:05:50	@J	or something
2014-02-22 17:06:17	@J	either way, the laptop's 5 years old and wasn't particularly expensive to start with
2014-02-22 17:06:21	@J	so I'm not complaining
2014-02-22 17:06:57	@J	plus I've now saved up enough money that I can buy something nice without feeling bad about it
2014-02-22 17:07:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-02-22 17:07:19	@Espyo	it's for the best
2014-02-22 17:07:25	@Espyo	still, there should be parts that can be saved
2014-02-22 17:07:34	@J	and used for what?
2014-02-22 17:07:36	@Espyo	a few Linux distro live CDs come with... uh, what's it called
2014-02-22 17:07:42	@Espyo	that thing that checked if RAMs are fine
2014-02-22 17:07:52	@Espyo	RAMs are always appreciated
2014-02-22 17:08:03	@J	yeah, I guess
2014-02-22 17:08:06	@Espyo	for instance, if your Pi's RAMs blow up
2014-02-22 17:08:10	@Espyo	the rest is mostly useless, yes
2014-02-22 17:08:13	@Espyo	well, not the hard drive
2014-02-22 17:08:16	@J	but laptops don't even often come with spare RAM slots
2014-02-22 17:08:28	@J	and RAM doesn't really often fail
2014-02-22 17:08:30	@Espyo	right, but the RAMs can still be replacements
2014-02-22 17:08:43	@J	and the RAM in here is probably larger than the Pi...
2014-02-22 17:08:47	@Espyo	still, you have nothing else to do with them, might as well save them
2014-02-22 17:08:51	@J	I mean, larger than the whole board
2014-02-22 17:08:58	@J	yeah, true
2014-02-22 17:09:10	@J	I think I still have a bag somewhere with RAM from an even older laptop
2014-02-22 17:09:30	@Espyo	e-mail the scraps to me, my mum does handcraft work making Christmas decorations out of broken electronic parts
2014-02-22 17:09:30	@J	plus a drive that makes ominous clicking noises but never actually died
2014-02-22 17:09:45	@Espyo	heh, two sticks of 128MB each?
2014-02-22 17:09:54	@J	something like that, probably
2014-02-22 17:10:16	@J	I think they're in London so I can't check
2014-02-22 17:13:21	@J	how did we ever survive with that much?
2014-02-22 17:13:57	@Espyo	I know, right?
2014-02-22 17:14:14	@Espyo	sure, programs were simpler back then
2014-02-22 17:14:17	@Espyo	but even still, come on
2014-02-22 17:15:06	@J	and 2GiB hard drives
2014-02-22 17:15:26	@J	I'm using 3.6 on this temporary install
2014-02-22 17:17:55	@Espyo	I had a 4GB one, it felt infinite, actually
2014-02-22 17:37:10	Spark	i dont know much about computers but i think my current laptop has 2 GB
2014-02-22 17:37:56	@Espyo	even today 2GB isn't that bad
2014-02-22 17:39:15	Spark	ive had it for 2 years and havent run out yet
2014-02-22 17:39:48	@J	wait, memory or disk?
2014-02-22 17:40:22	Spark	idk
2014-02-22 17:40:31	Spark	i just remember seeing 2 gigabytes somewhere on my computer
2014-02-22 17:40:32	@Espyo	'cause there's a difference...
2014-02-22 17:40:38	@Espyo	probably disk
2014-02-22 17:40:46	@J	really?
2014-02-22 17:40:46	@Espyo	if you didn't right-click my computer and checked properties
2014-02-22 17:41:02	@J	maybe on a sticker on the laptop
2014-02-22 17:41:24	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-02-22 17:41:29	@Espyo	but it's probably RAM
2014-02-22 17:41:35	Spark	3 GB ram, 2GB disc space
2014-02-22 17:41:42	@Espyo	whâ€”
2014-02-22 17:41:46	@Espyo	there's no way that's right
2014-02-22 17:41:47	@J	that doesn't really
2014-02-22 17:41:51	@J	TB?
2014-02-22 17:42:07	@Espyo	are you 100% you didn't mix the two around?
2014-02-22 17:42:16	@J	even then
2014-02-22 17:42:39	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-02-22 17:43:12	Spark	...OH 
2014-02-22 17:43:14	Spark	its 200
2014-02-22 17:43:28	Spark	whoops, thought there was a decimal there >.<
2014-02-22 17:43:40	@J	yep
2014-02-22 17:43:55	@J	I was talking about when you used to get drives 100 times smaller
2014-02-22 17:44:18	@Espyo	phew
2014-02-22 17:44:20	Spark	oookay lol

2014-02-22 17:53:10	@Espyo	harvesting wrinklers is a great strategy
2014-02-22 17:53:23	@Espyo	almost the only way to get a decent amount of cookies, after a while
2014-02-22 17:53:26	TheGrandmasAreMad	Hi
2014-02-22 17:53:33	@Espyo	I suppose you mean letting them suck and popping them at the end of the day
2014-02-22 17:53:33	@Espyo	hey
2014-02-22 17:54:16	TheGrandmasAreMad	What do the grandmas do when they are angry?
2014-02-22 17:54:27	@Espyo	nothing
2014-02-22 17:54:32	TheGrandmasAreMad	Oh
2014-02-22 17:54:43	Spark	if you have all the golden cookie upgrades then you can also just do elder pledge and keep getting gold cookies
2014-02-22 17:54:56	Spark	but wrinklers give you more of a bonus dont they
2014-02-22 17:55:21	TheGrandmasAreMad	I have 7 Wrinklers sucking on the cookie
2014-02-22 17:55:29	@Espyo	 10 is the max
2014-02-22 17:55:31	@Espyo	let them come
2014-02-22 17:55:37	TheGrandmasAreMad	I know
2014-02-22 17:55:41	@Espyo	wrinklers give more, I think
2014-02-22 17:55:52	@Espyo	but there's an in-between stage where you can have golden cookies AND wrinklers
2014-02-22 17:56:04	@Espyo	just don't buy Communal Brainsweep
2014-02-22 17:56:12	TheGrandmasAreMad	Umm...
2014-02-22 17:58:22	TheGrandmasAreMad	Too late
2014-02-22 17:59:25	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-02-22 17:59:55	TheGrandmasAreMad	Last night was horrible
2014-02-22 18:01:53	TheGrandmasAreMad	 10 Wrinklers!
2014-02-22 18:03:30	TheGrandmasAreMad	Espyo how long are you an op for?
2014-02-22 18:05:44	@Espyo	about 40 minutes
2014-02-22 18:06:15	TheGrandmasAreMad	K
2014-02-22 18:07:33	TheGrandmasAreMad	Was Testyo hard to make?
2014-02-22 18:09:44	TheGrandmasAreMad	Wait did you make Testyo?
2014-02-22 18:10:02	@Espyo	I did
2014-02-22 18:10:09	@Espyo	he was a bit hard
2014-02-22 18:10:10	TheGrandmasAreMad	Was it hard to make?
2014-02-22 18:10:18	@Espyo	I mean, it's a bit hard to get the connections and everything to work
2014-02-22 18:10:23	@Espyo	it's easy, but there are always stupid problems
2014-02-22 18:10:24	TheGrandmasAreMad	If he is a bot, how it he on the chatroom?
2014-02-22 18:10:37	@Espyo	other than that, he was easy to make, but took a long while to get where he is today
2014-02-22 18:10:50	@Espyo	he's just a connection on the chatroom's server
2014-02-22 18:10:55	TheGrandmasAreMad	Oh
2014-02-22 18:11:01	@Espyo	the server doesn't know if the person typing the text is a human or a bot
2014-02-22 18:11:03	Spark	welp turns out i might have just killed my friend.
2014-02-22 18:11:19	@Espyo	it just cares that somebody called "Espyo" wrote text
2014-02-22 18:11:23	@Espyo	it doesn't care how that text got in there
2014-02-22 18:11:33	@Espyo	and for Testyo's case, he just reads what's on the chat and writes stuff accordingly
2014-02-22 18:11:38	@Espyo	like conversions: 35 meters
2014-02-22 18:11:38	Testyo	35 meters = 38.276 yd / 114.828 ft / 1842.11 Olimar-heights / 5833.31 TRY-heights
2014-02-22 18:12:03	TheGrandmasAreMad	Testyo should learn to say hi whenever someone else says hi to him
2014-02-22 18:13:09	Spark	Espyo should learn to give sprak the source code to his bot
2014-02-22 18:13:26	@Espyo	it's kind of a mess
2014-02-22 18:13:30	TheGrandmasAreMad	What is a source code?
2014-02-22 18:13:31	@Espyo	that's mostly why it's not open source
2014-02-22 18:13:49	@Espyo	that, and the fact that Testyo kinda exists to satisfy my needs and the needs of the users I hang around with
2014-02-22 18:13:59	@Espyo	he's stylized like that and all
2014-02-22 18:14:09	@Espyo	he's flexible, and can adapt to all sorts of features and needs, but
2014-02-22 18:14:14	@Espyo	internally, he's kinda organized my way
2014-02-22 18:14:20	@Espyo	so the code isn't really to be shared
2014-02-22 18:14:21	TheGrandmasAreMad	But he won't say hi to me when I say hi to him
2014-02-22 18:14:25	@Espyo	I can still share snippets, though
2014-02-22 18:14:33	Spark	ok sorey
2014-02-22 18:14:38	@Espyo	hmm, fair enough
2014-02-22 18:14:42	@Espyo	Testyo: hi means Hello!
2014-02-22 18:14:46	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-02-22 18:14:48	@Espyo	Testyo: unserious
2014-02-22 18:14:48	Testyo	I wasn't in serious mode...
2014-02-22 18:14:53	@Espyo	Testyo: unserious #Pikipedia
2014-02-22 18:14:53	Testyo	I am no longer in serious mode on #Pikipedia; I can do funny random things again!
2014-02-22 18:14:55	@Espyo	Testyo: hi means Hello!
2014-02-22 18:14:55	Testyo	Ok, now I know that hi means Hello!.
2014-02-22 18:15:00	@Espyo	Testyo: serious #Pikipedia
2014-02-22 18:15:00	Testyo	Very well. I am now in "serious" mode on #Pikipedia.
2014-02-22 18:15:03	TheGrandmasAreMad	Hi Testyo
2014-02-22 18:15:06	@Espyo	there, he'll now say it back in PMs
2014-02-22 18:15:09	@Espyo	he's meant to be quiet here
2014-02-22 18:15:14	TheGrandmasAreMad	Ok
2014-02-22 18:15:36	TheGrandmasAreMad	I want to make a bot like Testyo someday
2014-02-22 18:15:58	Spark	well if you wont show the source code, can i at least ask what library you used for sockets and such
2014-02-22 18:16:03	Spark	:p
2014-02-22 18:16:04	@Espyo	simple: none
2014-02-22 18:16:20	@Espyo	all done by hand
2014-02-22 18:16:23	@Espyo	it's actually not that complicated
2014-02-22 18:16:31	TheGrandmasAreMad	What did you use to program it?
2014-02-22 18:16:37	@Espyo	C++
2014-02-22 18:16:43	@Espyo	it requires knowing how to program
2014-02-22 18:16:44	TheGrandmasAreMad	Oh
2014-02-22 18:16:53	Spark	w-what
2014-02-22 18:16:56	Spark	by hand
2014-02-22 18:16:59	@Espyo	yeah
2014-02-22 18:17:02	@Espyo	no libraries for sockets
2014-02-22 18:17:08	@Espyo	well, I mean
2014-02-22 18:17:10	Spark	like, not even using winsock or anything o_o
2014-02-22 18:17:11	@Espyo	I did include some .h
2014-02-22 18:17:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-02-22 18:17:19	TheGrandmasAreMad	I don't have C++ :(
2014-02-22 18:17:19	@Espyo	but I meant I didn't use any external library
2014-02-22 18:17:28	Spark	yes you do TheGrandmasAreMad 
2014-02-22 18:17:28	@Espyo	didn't download anything special to make it happen
2014-02-22 18:17:34	TheGrandmasAreMad	What?
2014-02-22 18:17:55	Spark	you dont need to download c++
2014-02-22 18:18:06	Spark	it isnt even really a thing
2014-02-22 18:18:14	TheGrandmasAreMad	Then how do I use it?
2014-02-22 18:18:29	Spark	download a compiler and write some code
2014-02-22 18:18:29	@Espyo	it's complicated
2014-02-22 18:18:55	TheGrandmasAreMad	I don't even know what a compiler is
2014-02-22 18:19:05	TheGrandmasAreMad	Lol
2014-02-22 18:19:17	@Espyo	you need to know a lot of things
2014-02-22 18:19:24	@Espyo	you can't just dive in and code
2014-02-22 18:19:35	Spark	yeah
2014-02-22 18:19:41	TheGrandmasAreMad	What do I need to know?
2014-02-22 18:19:48	Spark	i did that and look how i turned out F(
2014-02-22 18:20:08	@Espyo	well, first and foremost, you probably want to know what a programming language is
2014-02-22 18:20:30	TheGrandmasAreMad	Yes
2014-02-22 18:21:27	Spark	what i'd suggest: download code::blocks (codeblocks.org) and read a good C++ tutorial (www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
2014-02-22 18:22:17	TheGrandmasAreMad	What is code::blocks?
2014-02-22 18:22:39	Spark	okay lemme try to explian
2014-02-22 18:23:00	Spark	im not an expert myself so i may not do the best job
2014-02-22 18:23:02	TheGrandmasAreMad	Nvm I figured it out
2014-02-22 18:23:08	Spark	okay
2014-02-22 18:23:20	Spark	so you understand what it does?
2014-02-22 18:23:58	TheGrandmasAreMad	I think
2014-02-22 18:24:29	@J	also, C++ is a pretty bad first language
2014-02-22 18:24:39	@Espyo	it really is
2014-02-22 18:24:41	Spark	it is?
2014-02-22 18:24:45	TheGrandmasAreMad	What
2014-02-22 18:24:57	@Espyo	you're better off starting with the likes of Visual Basic
2014-02-22 18:24:58	Spark	i wish someone had told me that 
2014-02-22 18:24:58	@Espyo	or Javascript
2014-02-22 18:25:06	@Espyo	heh, it's ok
2014-02-22 18:25:08	TheGrandmasAreMad	Visual Basic...
2014-02-22 18:25:10	@Espyo	you get the hang of C++
2014-02-22 18:25:17	@Espyo	so it just ends up being a boon
2014-02-22 18:25:22	@Espyo	(is that even the word I want)
2014-02-22 18:25:30	Spark	(i think so)
2014-02-22 18:25:38	@Espyo	(it kinda is)
2014-02-22 18:25:55	@Espyo	you shouldn't start with C++, but if you do and you get the hang of it, you're pretty much unstoppable
2014-02-22 18:25:58	@J	I think JavaScript is bad too because some parts are a mess
2014-02-22 18:26:07	TheGrandmasAreMad	What about Visual Basic?
2014-02-22 18:26:26	@Espyo	that's true, but for the most part, you get stuff done right away, you don't need an IDE or compilers or anything, and you really don't worry about a lot of things, like variable definition
2014-02-22 18:26:35	@J	never really looked at/touched VB
2014-02-22 18:26:39	@Espyo	Visual Basic changed since I last messed with it, but I think the current version is pretty simple still
2014-02-22 18:26:48	@J	also, just for the record, C++ was my first language too
2014-02-22 18:27:02	@J	if I'd started with almost any other language, I'd've got going much more quickly
2014-02-22 18:27:07	Spark	i never really did much with javascript but the tutorials i found for it explained concepts much better than C++ tutorials did
2014-02-22 18:27:22	@Espyo	I did Pascal first, then Casio Calculator Basic (yes), then Visual Basic, then C++
2014-02-22 18:27:33	@J	also, JavaScript might be a poor choice because of the amount of bad JS out there
2014-02-22 18:27:39	@Espyo	true also
2014-02-22 18:27:53	@Espyo	and the C++ tutorials focus more on advanced stuff
2014-02-22 18:28:00	@Espyo	there's a lot you can do right from the get-go
2014-02-22 18:28:14	@Espyo	so tutorials just don't waste time detailing everything
2014-02-22 18:29:14	@Espyo	...I can't believe I have to ask this, but
2014-02-22 18:29:17	@Espyo	 225 deg

2014-02-22 18:38:38	@Espyo	 5 pounds
2014-02-22 18:38:39	Testyo	5 pounds = 2.268 kg / 0.357 st / 80 oz
2014-02-22 18:38:42	@Espyo	 80 ounces
2014-02-22 18:38:42	Testyo	80 ounces = 2.264 kg / 0.352 st / 5 lb
2014-02-22 18:38:48	@Espyo	not quite sure how accurate that whole thing is
2014-02-22 18:38:57	TheGrandmasAreMad	 101 pounds
2014-02-22 18:38:57	Testyo	101 pounds = 45.8136 kg / 7.2114 st / 1616 oz
2014-02-22 18:39:23	TheGrandmasAreMad	But he doesn't know centimeters and inches, right?
2014-02-22 18:39:26	TheGrandmasAreMad	 2 centimeters

2014-02-22 18:40:25	TheGrandmasAreMad	What are Olimar-Heights?
2014-02-22 18:40:33	@Espyo	exactly what it sounds like
2014-02-22 18:40:41	@Espyo	the height of Olimar, Pikmin's main protagonist
2014-02-22 18:40:50	@Espyo	judging by the instruction book
2014-02-22 18:40:51	@Espyo	 1.9cm

2014-02-22 18:40:58	TheGrandmasAreMad	Ok
2014-02-22 18:41:07	@Espyo	he doesn't do the conversion the other way around, too lazy to make him do it

2014-02-22 18:43:21	@Espyo	like learning how to play
2014-02-22 18:43:46	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 does instruct you on the controls and such, but goes "Remember, Captain Olimar? You press A to grab a Pikmin?"
2014-02-22 18:43:52	@Espyo	but it's not even the case in Pikmin 3

2014-02-23 20:55:25	@Espyo	not sure really
2014-02-23 20:55:29	@Espyo	I use std::string
2014-02-23 20:55:38	@Espyo	but I don't think there is a difference
2014-02-23 20:56:17	Spark	hm
2014-02-23 20:56:27	Spark	the first one doesnt work but the second one does
2014-02-23 20:58:30	@Espyo	hmm
2014-02-23 20:58:49	@Espyo	well, I suppose the first one is a pointer to a single char
2014-02-23 20:58:55	@Espyo	the second one is a pointer to an array
2014-02-23 20:59:01	@Espyo	(implied pointer, I suppose)

2014-02-23 21:18:02	Spark	theres no simple way, at least i couldnt find one
2014-02-23 21:18:21	Spark	the idea is that i can just instantly grab x word from any string
2014-02-23 21:18:45	Spark	also hi TPM
2014-02-23 21:18:47	@Espyo	well, using std::string, I mean

2014-02-23 21:19:47	@Espyo	but yeah, you may wanna just use std::string
2014-02-23 21:19:56	@Espyo	like std::vector, it makes everything a lot easier

2014-02-23 22:30:39	@Espyo	yeah, actually
2014-02-23 22:44:57	Spark	apparently you can leave off that last part of code for everything after the final delimiter
2014-02-23 22:45:31	Spark	im making a simpler function based off that to suit my needs and i forgot to add it, but it still works
2014-02-23 22:46:49	@Espyo	did I leave a ToDo there with that question?
2014-02-23 22:46:51	@Espyo	I tend to do that :|

2014-02-23 22:47:42	@Espyo	when you write a comment starting with ToDo, or todo, or TODO, or whatever
2014-02-23 22:47:55	@Espyo	it's just to leave behind a note that you have something that needs to be done in the future, so you don't forget
2014-02-23 22:48:04	Spark	yeah i understand what that means but
2014-02-23 22:48:10	Spark	what question
2014-02-23 22:48:25	@Espyo	if I had left a question, it'd be something like "//ToDo do I need this?"

2014-02-23 22:48:59	Spark	well, mine may have some slight difference that chances the result but otherwise im pretty sure you dont :p

2014-02-24 21:14:02	@Espyo	the time it takes to learn it and use it effectively is greater than the time it takes me to implement stuff from scratch in C++
2014-02-24 21:54:50	@J	yeah, but you only have to learn something else once
2014-02-24 21:56:37	@Espyo	but I don't have time for saving time

2014-02-24 21:57:59	@J	...I see
2014-02-24 21:58:09	@Espyo	I did
2014-02-24 21:58:35	@Espyo	yeah, he was banned in other channels already apparently
2014-02-24 21:59:42	@J	so try Node.js
2014-02-24 22:04:47	@Espyo	hm
2014-02-24 22:05:25	@Espyo	yeah, this is useful for sockets and such
2014-02-24 22:05:30	@Espyo	I thought it'd be useful for general JS
2014-02-24 22:05:37	@Espyo	a bit like jquery is
2014-02-24 22:06:19	@J	'thought'?
2014-02-24 22:08:13	@Espyo	...yeah?
2014-02-24 22:09:44	@J	as in you don't any more?
2014-02-24 22:10:40	@Espyo	I
2014-02-24 22:11:03	@Espyo	I don't any more because I see Node.js is more focused to making web-related stuff in JS easier
2014-02-24 22:11:25	@J	hmm, not really
2014-02-24 22:11:33	@J	it's focused on any I/O
2014-02-24 22:11:44	@Espyo	it's the point they're trying to get across on the main page
2014-02-24 22:11:44	@J	which I guess is basically disk or web
2014-02-24 22:12:27	@J	but yeah, it's more of a set of libraries for making things possible rather than making general code easier
2014-02-24 22:12:38	@Espyo	oh yeah, I see
2014-02-24 22:12:39	@J	for that, use library like Underscore
2014-02-24 22:12:49	@J	*a library
2014-02-24 22:13:01	@Espyo	yeah
2014-02-24 22:13:28	@Espyo	but yeah, for stuff that requires doing stuff like that, I can use stuff like Node.js and stuff
2014-02-24 22:13:31	@J	jQuery is much more focused on DOM and browser stuff, anyway
2014-02-24 22:13:42	@Espyo	but for making games, I think I'll stick with Allegro and C++, for now at least
2014-02-24 22:13:46	@Espyo	it's pretty solid, multi-platform
2014-02-24 22:13:59	@Espyo	and I'm already so proficient at it
2014-02-24 22:14:00	@J	hmm, yeah, not sure about Node for games
2014-02-24 22:14:11	@Espyo	really don't think Node'd be that great for games
2014-02-24 22:14:14	@J	I was thinking more command-line applications
2014-02-24 22:14:19	@Espyo	but if I need sâ€” yeah, exactly
2014-02-24 22:14:41	@Espyo	specially considering windows' retarded command-line
2014-02-24 22:14:41	@J	well, there are SDL bindings
2014-02-24 22:14:55	@J	and SFML
2014-02-24 22:15:54	@Espyo	hm
2014-02-24 22:16:03	@J	OpenGL support seems to be mostly WebGL
2014-02-24 22:16:34	@J	there are GTK and Qt bindings
2014-02-24 22:18:56	@Espyo	yeah, WebGL
2014-02-24 22:19:12	@Espyo	I learned about it a bit while gathering info for my internship

2014-02-24 23:09:02	@Espyo	as a contestant, yeah
2014-02-24 23:09:12	@Espyo	only lasted for 5 questions today, there's more tomorrow
2014-02-24 23:31:25	Spark	sooo
2014-02-24 23:31:51	Spark	i got the client to connect to darkmyst but instead of getting pings, all i got were random glitchy characters
2014-02-24 23:32:50	Spark	dyou know what's up with that, esp?
2014-02-24 23:33:03	@Espyo	random glitchy characters...
2014-02-24 23:33:07	@Espyo	weird
2014-02-24 23:33:28	@Espyo	I don't suppose it's a problem parsing from ASCII to Unicode
2014-02-24 23:33:31	@Espyo	or vice versa
2014-02-24 23:33:39	@Espyo	is any of it readable text?
2014-02-24 23:33:53	Spark	yeah, some of it is
2014-02-24 23:34:01	Spark	i had a pastebin of the logs, lemme go find it
2014-02-24 23:34:03	@Espyo	where does it stop being readable?
2014-02-24 23:34:33	Spark	http://pastebin.com/Wfg8MQN5
2014-02-24 23:35:07	@Espyo	oh, heh
2014-02-24 23:35:09	@Espyo	classic mistake
2014-02-24 23:35:17	@Espyo	you're not clearing up your strings each time
2014-02-24 23:35:23	@Espyo	so you get garbage from the previous batch

2014-02-24 23:35:36	Spark	ohhh
2014-02-24 23:35:39	@Espyo	hm, but yeah, no PINGs
2014-02-24 23:35:42	@Espyo	there should be some
2014-02-24 23:35:45	@Espyo	oh wait
2014-02-24 23:35:45	primking	hi
2014-02-24 23:35:53	@Espyo	maybe you only get pinged after sending USERINFO and the like
2014-02-24 23:35:57	@Espyo	hey
2014-02-24 23:35:58	primking	im back for a LOOOOOONG time
2014-02-24 23:36:19	Spark	so when you say clearing do you mean like, recvbuf="";
2014-02-24 23:36:35	@Espyo	I think you really have to go to each character manually and set it to 0
2014-02-24 23:36:41	primking	I got a wiiU last year
2014-02-24 23:36:49	@Espyo	or... go to the bytes_received position and set it to 0? let me check
2014-02-24 23:36:55	primking	but I got to go shortly because I got to make a youtube
2014-02-24 23:37:42	@Espyo	hm, ok
2014-02-24 23:37:44	primking	ill just go because no-one isn't talking to meh, bye

2014-02-24 23:37:52	@Espyo	we're busy with something else hâ€”
2014-02-24 23:38:01	@Espyo	...well, not like impatience is new to #pikipedia
2014-02-24 23:38:06	@Espyo	...who was he, again?
2014-02-24 23:38:33	@Espyo	anyway, yeah, I have if(bytes_received >= 0) buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';
2014-02-24 23:38:37	@Espyo	and that's enough to get rid of the garbage
2014-02-24 23:38:44	@Espyo	because it just fills characters into your buffer
2014-02-24 23:38:50	@Espyo	without filling in the \0 character
2014-02-24 23:38:53	@Espyo	which marks the end of a string
2014-02-24 23:38:58	@Espyo	so it keeps going and reads garbage
2014-02-24 23:39:02	@Espyo	and surprisingly doesn't crash
2014-02-24 23:39:21	@Espyo	setting the character after all the characters that were dumped to be \0 fixes it
2014-02-24 23:39:32	Spark	wait, wouldnt you be only setting the last character to \0 though?
2014-02-24 23:40:49	@Espyo	yeah
2014-02-24 23:40:54	@Espyo	the previous ones are the ones you received
2014-02-24 23:41:19	@Espyo	when you receive "PING 123", it fills the first 8 bytes of your buffer, with 'P', 'I', etc.
2014-02-24 23:41:27	@Espyo	but the 9th should be \0 but isn't
2014-02-24 23:41:29	@Espyo	you do it manually
2014-02-24 23:41:36	@Espyo	and you get a normal string: "PING 123\0"
2014-02-24 23:42:02	Spark	oh that makes sense
2014-02-24 23:52:20	Spark	hmm
2014-02-24 23:52:31	Spark	http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html i dont see anything about a USERINFO command
2014-02-24 23:55:07	@Espyo	hm
2014-02-24 23:55:21	@Espyo	ok, so Testyo starts by sending NICK Testyo
2014-02-24 23:55:47	@Espyo	then USER Testyo Testyo Testyo :Testyo
2014-02-24 23:55:57	@Espyo	then that's it
2014-02-24 23:56:02	@Espyo	it starts waiting for stuff
2014-02-24 23:56:54	Spark	 ive got the same thing but with sparkbot instead of testyo
2014-02-24 23:57:31	@Espyo	no pings after?
2014-02-24 23:57:32	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-02-24 23:57:36	@Espyo	let me check the actual logs
2014-02-24 23:58:38	@Espyo	yeah, after NICK and USER, it receives that info text from the server
2014-02-24 23:58:49	@Espyo	i.e. the motd
2014-02-24 23:59:13	@Espyo	then it sends JOIN #Pikipedia
2014-02-24 23:59:27	@Espyo	then it receives its things
2014-02-24 23:59:36	@Espyo	no pings in the meantime...
2014-02-24 23:59:57	@Espyo	oh, another network starts with a PING
2014-02-25 00:00:03	@Espyo	DarkMyst doesn't
2014-02-25 00:00:27	Spark	hm
2014-02-25 00:00:33	@Espyo	I guess you timeout because you don't join a channel?
2014-02-25 00:01:37	Spark	i just added the code to join a channel
2014-02-25 00:01:50	Spark	but it times out immediately after it says "found your host name"
2014-02-25 00:02:57	@Espyo	woah
2014-02-25 00:03:02	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right at all
2014-02-25 00:03:08	@Espyo	maybe you're not sending the data right somehow?
2014-02-25 00:03:15	@Espyo	try another network
2014-02-25 00:04:40	Spark	http://pastebin.com/ZAVZ4nZ3
2014-02-25 00:06:18	@Espyo	what
2014-02-25 00:06:20	@Espyo	what's indent
2014-02-25 00:06:22	@Espyo	I never receive that
2014-02-25 00:07:48	Spark	*shrug*
2014-02-25 00:08:43	Spark	http://pastebin.com/zeCdQe1T
2014-02-25 00:08:58	Spark	i copied most of the code from a microsoft tutorial so it should work pretty well
2014-02-25 00:14:16	@Espyo	oh, I think I see what's up
2014-02-25 00:14:35	@Espyo	in HTTP and IRC, a message is considered finalized when it ends with \r\n
2014-02-25 00:15:07	@Espyo	as far as the server cares, you sent "NICK Sparkbot USER Sparkbot Sparkbot Sparkbot :SparkBot", and are still waiting to send more
2014-02-25 00:15:11	@Espyo	and you never complete it
2014-02-25 00:31:31	Spark	one last thinggg
2014-02-25 00:31:33	Spark	http://pastebin.com/mAaCpLLZ
2014-02-25 00:31:48	Spark	do you see anything wrong with that by any chance,
2014-02-25 00:31:52	Spark	it doesnt seem to be working
2014-02-25 00:36:47	@Espyo	bufferlength should be bufferlength - 1
2014-02-25 00:36:54	@Espyo	because if your buffer has 10 spots
2014-02-25 00:36:57	@Espyo	and it sends 10 characters
2014-02-25 00:37:02	@Espyo	you want to place the \0 on the 11th
2014-02-25 00:37:03	@Espyo	= kaboom
2014-02-25 00:38:11	@Espyo	instead .at(0), you can just do [0]
2014-02-25 00:38:20	@Espyo	it's cosier
2014-02-25 00:39:07	@Espyo	finally, I imagine that that pastebin is cropped
2014-02-25 00:39:15	@Espyo	otherwise you're only receiving one thing
2014-02-25 00:39:25	@Espyo	but yeah, other than all of that, do you ever receive any PING?
2014-02-25 00:39:33	Spark	i did
2014-02-25 00:39:38	Spark	i recieved a ping
2014-02-25 00:39:45	Spark	but it didnt work, that's the thing
2014-02-25 00:39:51	@Espyo	do you still timeout?
2014-02-25 00:39:51	Spark	it didnt respond to the ping
2014-02-25 00:40:03	@Espyo	you're the one who responds to pings
2014-02-25 00:40:13	@Espyo	the server goes ping, you go pong, and that's the end of it
2014-02-25 00:40:25	Spark	i know
2014-02-25 00:40:31	Spark	i wrote a function to do that, though
2014-02-25 00:40:35	Spark	and tis not working
2014-02-25 00:40:46	@Espyo	are you sending PONG :123456\r\n?
2014-02-25 00:40:53	@Espyo	I mean, are you sending the \r\n at the end?
2014-02-25 00:41:26	Spark	 oh i wasnt
2014-02-25 00:41:30	@Espyo	that might be it
2014-02-25 00:41:32	Spark	but it still wont work
2014-02-25 00:41:54	@Espyo	you're better off writing a send_message function that takes a string, and does all the hard work of converting to a c-string, adding the \r\n, etc.
2014-02-25 00:42:30	@Espyo	hm, it still doesn't work?
2014-02-25 00:42:34	@Espyo	I can't see anything else that's wrong
2014-02-25 00:56:36	Spark	http://pastebin.com/CxWV7JAZ
2014-02-25 00:56:43	Spark	there, i made the function like you suggested
2014-02-25 00:58:04	@Espyo	hm
2014-02-25 00:58:06	@Espyo	is it working now?
2014-02-25 00:58:09	Spark	no
2014-02-25 00:58:13	Spark	:p
2014-02-25 00:58:35	@Espyo	does the program ever enter the if(firstword == "PING") code?
2014-02-25 00:58:45	Spark	nop
2014-02-25 00:59:23	Spark	waitittttt
2014-02-25 00:59:25	@Espyo	well, put 2 printfs just before that if
2014-02-25 00:59:28	Spark	suddenly it works?
2014-02-25 00:59:33	@Espyo	one prints the entire message, the other prints the first word
2014-02-25 00:59:34	@Espyo	oh?
2014-02-25 00:59:43	Spark	i just tested it and it didnt but now it does :s
2014-02-25 01:00:39	@Espyo	well, good :|
2014-02-25 01:00:43	@Espyo	maybe you forgot to compile before
2014-02-25 01:00:46	@Espyo	or didn't close
2014-02-25 01:00:50	@Espyo	...or C++ is just being C++

2014-02-25 17:34:15	@Espyo	not bad for a run where you missed the Thardus skip
2014-02-25 17:34:21	@Espyo	finally got around to seeing your AGDQ run
2014-02-25 17:34:24	@Espyo	Zoid being there was just great
2014-02-25 17:34:31	@Espyo	the maze prediction blew my mnd
2014-02-25 17:34:32	@Espyo	*mind
2014-02-25 19:16:55	Miles	I read your correction as "the mind prediction blew my mind" and was completely confused
2014-02-25 19:20:55	@Espyo	heh
2014-02-25 19:21:05	@Espyo	to be honest, that would blow my mind if you did it

2014-02-26 20:05:35	@J	.
2014-02-26 20:05:45	@J	I got around to playing Monaco recently
2014-02-26 20:05:48	@J	it's pretty fun
2014-02-26 20:05:58	@Espyo	Monaco? sounds generic
2014-02-26 20:06:02	@Espyo	is it a racing game?
2014-02-26 20:06:03	@J	...
2014-02-26 20:06:05	@Espyo	Monaco GP rings a bell
2014-02-26 20:06:08	@J	we've discussed it at least twice
2014-02-26 20:06:24	@J	the top-down stealth game
2014-02-26 20:06:34	@J	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine
2014-02-26 20:07:58	@J	the character balance impresses me - they all have completely different abilities, but somehow it doesn't feel like any of them are that much better or worse
2014-02-26 20:08:28	@J	like, one can stun enemies when touching them if they don't see him first, others have to use weapons
2014-02-26 20:08:35	@J	one can dig through almost any wall
2014-02-26 20:08:51	@J	one can pick locks faster
2014-02-26 20:09:09	@J	some sound overpowered compared to others, but when you play, it doesn't feel like that
2014-02-26 20:12:26	@Espyo	ah, of course
2014-02-26 20:12:28	@Espyo	I just forgot the name
2014-02-26 20:12:59	@Espyo	uh, you play with like 4 characters at once or something, right?
2014-02-26 20:14:24	@J	you can do
2014-02-26 20:14:25	@J	1-4
2014-02-26 20:14:28	@J	also online
2014-02-26 20:14:41	@J	local multiplayer seems like it would be fun
2014-02-26 20:15:05	@J	wait, I made up the 4
2014-02-26 20:15:07	@J	1-something
2014-02-26 20:15:10	@J	don't really know
2014-02-26 20:15:24	@Espyo	h
2014-02-26 20:15:26	@Espyo	*oh
2014-02-26 20:15:44	@Espyo	yeah, it sounds like one of those games were balance would be super hard to work in
2014-02-26 20:16:05	@Espyo	well, finished the Metroid block
2014-02-26 20:16:07	@Espyo	it was incredible
2014-02-26 20:16:26	@Espyo	kinda sad to think AGDQ2015 is going to have a really hard time beating AGDQ2014

2014-02-28 19:05:37	@Espyo	are the letters actually arranged in DVORAK now?
2014-02-28 19:05:41	@Espyo	(were they before?)
2014-02-28 19:06:20	@Espyo	shower now, bbl
2014-02-28 19:09:27	@J	they weren't before (you're not really going to manage that with a laptop unless they're rearrangeable or switchable)
2014-02-28 19:09:32	@J	and no, they aren't now
2014-02-28 19:09:50	@J	don't really need it, and it would just confuse anyone else trying to use it
2014-02-28 19:46:50	@Espyo	it already does confuse them
2014-02-28 19:46:56	@Espyo	unless you have a handy shortcut to switch between the two
2014-02-28 20:17:08	@J	of course
2014-02-28 20:17:18	@Espyo	windows 8 has a shortcut
2014-02-28 20:17:21	@Espyo	and a language bar
2014-02-28 20:17:31	@Espyo	...and a weird metro floating app like language menu
2014-02-28 20:17:40	@Espyo	they /really/ want you to switch languages in windows 8

2014-03-01 20:30:37	@PikFan	haven't been on lately because I'm grounded from the computer
2014-03-01 20:30:51	@Espyo	why is that?
2014-03-01 20:30:52	@Espyo	bad grades?
2014-03-01 20:30:52	@PikFan	so using Wii U
2014-03-01 20:31:02	@PikFan	yeah, you could say that
2014-03-01 20:31:07	@Espyo	gotta step up
2014-03-01 20:31:10	@PikFan	(((homework)))
2014-03-01 20:31:23	@Espyo	it sucks, but you have to do it
2014-03-01 20:31:33	@PikFan	right
2014-03-01 20:31:40	@Espyo	it wastes time, it doesn't help, it's inhumane
2014-03-01 20:31:42	@Espyo	but you must

2014-03-01 20:32:32	@Espyo	but nope

2014-03-01 20:32:46	@Espyo	plus studies have shown it doesn't help
2014-03-01 20:32:48	@PikFan	I don't mind being at school, though
2014-03-01 20:32:50	@Espyo	that's a bit debatable, but eh
2014-03-01 20:33:00	@Espyo	then you must be gifted
2014-03-01 20:33:08	@PikFan	I like learning
2014-03-01 20:33:13	@PikFan	but I hate homework
2014-03-01 20:33:19	@PikFan	I'd rather do it at school
2014-03-01 20:33:24	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-01 20:33:37	@PikFan	it's a good thing I have one of my periods just for homework
2014-03-01 20:34:24	@PikFan	anyway
2014-03-01 20:34:30	@PikFan	been playing Pikmin 3
2014-03-01 20:34:45	@PikFan	I finally decided to play some of the Battle Enemies! stages
2014-03-01 20:35:16	@PikFan	did better than I expected
2014-03-01 20:35:55	@PikFan	and I've been doing the growing Pikmin thing now in the story mode
2014-03-01 20:35:59	@PikFan	it's difficult
2014-03-01 20:36:12	@Espyo	why?
2014-03-01 20:36:15	@PikFan	and I usually don't get more than 200 Pikmin a day
2014-03-01 20:36:29	@PikFan	mm
2014-03-01 20:36:47	@PikFan	it's just that since the areas are so big, it takes a while to get places
2014-03-01 20:36:52	@PikFan	also no Purples
2014-03-01 20:36:52	@Espyo	hm, right
2014-03-01 20:36:57	@Espyo	of course
2014-03-01 20:37:08	@Espyo	but is it at least balanced?
2014-03-01 20:37:13	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-01 20:37:15	@Espyo	like stuff that gives more Pikmin farther into the back?
2014-03-01 20:37:24	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-01 20:37:29	@PikFan	depends on the area
2014-03-01 20:37:52	@PikFan	like...
2014-03-01 20:38:05	@PikFan	in the Twilight River, there's a group of 3 Orange Bulborbs
2014-03-01 20:38:11	@PikFan	each worth 15 seeds
2014-03-01 20:38:26	@PikFan	but they're a good ways away from the landing site
2014-03-01 20:38:43	@PikFan	Winged Pikmin are especially helpful
2014-03-01 20:39:39	@PikFan	when given spicy spray, they become killing machines (as Miles once stated)
2014-03-01 20:39:52	@Espyo	hehe
2014-03-01 20:40:33	@PikFan	also, speaking of growing Pikmin
2014-03-01 20:40:47	@PikFan	I'm 3/4 way done of day 567 in Pikmin 2
2014-03-01 20:40:55	@PikFan	I've grown over 900 Pikmin
2014-03-01 20:41:25	@PikFan	this will definitely make up for day 571 (ujadani)

2014-03-03 21:35:58	@J	http://www.stahlworks.com/dev/swiss-file-knife.html
2014-03-03 21:36:02	@J	came across this recently
2014-03-03 21:36:09	@J	seems like it has some useful stuff
2014-03-03 21:36:37	@J	some stuff small enough that you don't really get standalone utilities for it, because you can write one yourself in a couple of minutes
2014-03-03 21:38:56	@J	a fair amount of it is on every Linux anyway, but could be useful on Windows
2014-03-03 21:38:57	@Espyo	hey, pretty col
2014-03-03 21:39:31	@J	*still waiting for typo correction*
2014-03-03 21:41:07	@J	sad
2014-03-03 21:41:55	@Espyo	don't see it
2014-03-03 21:42:17	@Espyo	...oh
2014-03-03 21:42:18	@Espyo	mine
2014-03-03 21:42:20	@Espyo	*cool
2014-03-03 21:42:24	@Espyo	*colorful
2014-03-03 21:42:26	@Espyo	take your pick
2014-03-03 21:42:36	@Espyo	anyway, back to soup
2014-03-03 21:42:45	@Espyo	I was just letting it cool down
2014-03-03 21:42:48	@Espyo	or col down
2014-03-03 21:43:31	@J	'colorful' is not acceptable and you know it
2014-03-03 21:53:10	@Espyo	sfk color      - change text color of terminal
2014-03-03 21:53:12	@Espyo	Q.E.D.
2014-03-03 21:59:27	@J	clearly doctored
2014-03-03 22:24:28	@J	BTW, did you hear about the new TLDs made available?
2014-03-03 22:24:49	@Espyo	TLDs...
2014-03-03 22:24:56	@Espyo	doesn't ring a bell
2014-03-03 22:25:23	@J	now you can have things like .shop, .photography, etc. as the end of a domain
2014-03-03 22:25:46	@J	and anyone can apply for a new one (mostly for very large organisations)
2014-03-03 22:25:57	@Espyo	oh, pretty nice
2014-03-03 22:26:09	@Espyo	it's going to be a bit of a big change, though
2014-03-03 22:26:17	@Espyo	it'll take a while to get used to it
2014-03-03 22:27:49	@J	mhm
2014-03-03 22:28:46	@J	also makes it even easier for people to try to steal traffic from sites by using similar names
2014-03-03 22:29:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-03 22:57:15	@Espyo	why in the world is visual studio accessing DLLs from all sorts of random places?
2014-03-03 22:57:23	@Espyo	like FRAPS' DLL, KatMouse's...

2014-03-03 22:59:54	TPM	What does improved memo system mean?
2014-03-03 23:00:04	TPM	Wait nvm
2014-03-03 23:00:23	@J	hmm
2014-03-03 23:01:06	@J	similar to how, at work, some people are finding an example PST (email container or something) in the project repository randomly changes (Git says it changed)
2014-03-03 23:01:23	@J	best guess so far is Outlook is just fiddling with things it shouldn't
2014-03-03 23:02:37	@Espyo	it probably is

2014-03-04 00:11:41	@PikFan	/late
2014-03-04 00:16:41	@Espyo	hey
2014-03-04 00:16:55	@Espyo	so today I wanted to check something regarding Super Meat Boy
2014-03-04 00:16:58	@PikFan	so something weird happened here
2014-03-04 00:17:02	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fruit
2014-03-04 00:17:03	@Espyo	naturally, I looked for a wiki
2014-03-04 00:17:10	@Espyo	only a wikia existed
2014-03-04 00:17:18	@Espyo	but then I remembered, I have to stop being so biased
2014-03-04 00:17:36	@Espyo	just because it's on wikia doesn't mean the information has to be poor
2014-03-04 00:17:38	@PikFan	when I hover over a link
2014-03-04 00:17:44	@PikFan	it says "page does not exist" in Portugese
2014-03-04 00:17:48	@Espyo	I can endure the interface
2014-03-04 00:17:49	@PikFan	and yeah
2014-03-04 00:17:50	@Espyo	 /what/
2014-03-04 00:17:53	@Espyo	WHY in Portuguese
2014-03-04 00:17:57	@Espyo	PÃ¡gina nÃ£o existe?
2014-03-04 00:18:00	@PikFan	mhm
2014-03-04 00:18:39	@PikFan	I mean, this is when logged out
2014-03-04 00:18:49	@PikFan	logged in it's English
2014-03-04 00:19:06	@Espyo	hmm
2014-03-04 00:19:06	@PikFan	anyway, yeah
2014-03-04 00:19:10	@Espyo	is the entire wiki in Portuguese?
2014-03-04 00:19:16	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-03-04 00:19:22	@Espyo	page, talk, history tabs, the sidebar, ...
2014-03-04 00:19:29	@PikFan	but this is Pikipedia
2014-03-04 00:19:30	@Espyo	pÃ¡gina, discussÃ£o, histÃ³rico, ...
2014-03-04 00:19:38	@PikFan	probably because you made it
2014-03-04 00:20:01	@Espyo	but that's impossible
2014-03-04 00:20:12	@PikFan	and your default language is Portugese, so somehow it shows that to all logged out users or something
2014-03-04 00:21:24	@Espyo	how really weird...
2014-03-04 00:21:59	@PikFan	ok that's weird
2014-03-04 00:22:07	@PikFan	it only happens for that page
2014-03-04 00:22:16	@Espyo	Testyo: memo J PikFan says that when logged out, the tooltip of nonexistent pages has "pÃ¡gina nÃ£o existe" (Portuguese). y/n? ( http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fruit )
2014-03-04 00:22:16	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for J saying: PikFan says that when logged out, the tooltip of nonexistent pages has "pÃ¡gina nÃ£o existe" (Portuguese). y/n? ( http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fruit ).
2014-03-04 00:22:22	@Espyo	really?
2014-03-04 00:22:30	@PikFan	mhm
2014-03-04 00:22:45	@Espyo	anyway...
2014-03-04 00:22:55	@Espyo	so I checked the Super Meat Boy wikia for the information I wanted
2014-03-04 00:22:55	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Fruit_File_icons
2014-03-04 00:23:03	@Espyo	but I had to lose my bias, become a better man
2014-03-04 00:23:10	@PikFan	you made that page, yellow link, and English
2014-03-04 00:23:10	@Espyo	just because it's wikia doesn't mean the editors have to be horrible
2014-03-04 00:23:11	@PikFan	right
2014-03-04 00:23:24	@Espyo	the front page looked promising
2014-03-04 00:23:26	@PikFan	there are good wikias out there
2014-03-04 00:23:37	@Espyo	no featured article or anything, but loads of important links to articles
2014-03-04 00:23:40	@Espyo	off to a good start
2014-03-04 00:23:43	@PikFan	mm
2014-03-04 00:23:47	@Espyo	I go around and enter the page I wanted
2014-03-04 00:23:51	@Espyo	...and the problems started
2014-03-04 00:23:52	@PikFan	what's Super Meat Boy, though?
2014-03-04 00:23:54	@Espyo	poorly organized
2014-03-04 00:23:58	@Espyo	subjective facts
2014-03-04 00:24:03	@Espyo	images flying everywhere
2014-03-04 00:24:14	@Espyo	no categories
2014-03-04 00:24:25	@Espyo	I wanted to check if other pages had categories, so I clicked random page
2014-03-04 00:24:35	@PikFan	so it is bad, then?
2014-03-04 00:24:37	@Espyo	and it take me to a page about the laser, one of the game's hazards
2014-03-04 00:24:43	@Espyo	oh my goodness that page made me lose it
2014-03-04 00:24:51	@Espyo	I try, I really try to lose my wikia bias
2014-03-04 00:25:09	@Espyo	I really try to stop assuming all wikias are gonna be poor
2014-03-04 00:25:10	@Espyo	but damn
2014-03-04 00:25:16	@PikFan	but you edit on a wikia
2014-03-04 00:25:16	@Espyo	 100% of all wikias I've seen so far are poor
2014-03-04 00:25:19	@Espyo	I do, for now
2014-03-04 00:25:25	@Espyo	oh, yeah, bar that one
2014-03-04 00:25:27	@PikFan	Carmageddon Wiki, right?
2014-03-04 00:25:31	@Espyo	Carmageddon, yes
2014-03-04 00:25:41	@PikFan	or whatever â€” yay, got it right
2014-03-04 00:25:45	@Espyo	the pre-release of the new game will come out in less than two weeks
2014-03-04 00:25:51	@Espyo	and I might start adding info about that soon
2014-03-04 00:25:53	@PikFan	mm
2014-03-04 00:25:58	@Espyo	but NOT before moving out of this forsaken website
2014-03-04 00:26:11	@Espyo	also, Super Meat Boy is a quick-paced platformer game
2014-03-04 00:26:13	@Espyo	pretty cool
2014-03-04 00:26:17	@PikFan	Cookie Clicker wiki is kinda disorganized
2014-03-04 00:26:20	@PikFan	I see
2014-03-04 00:26:22	@Espyo	it is, yeah
2014-03-04 00:26:32	@PikFan	but it gets the point across
2014-03-04 00:26:40	@Espyo	one random example, there are Minus Worlds in SMB
2014-03-04 00:26:46	@Espyo	(which originate in SMB)
2014-03-04 00:26:55	@Espyo	((first SMB = Super Meat Boy, second = Super Mario Bros.))
2014-03-04 00:26:59	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-04 00:27:24	@Espyo	and on the Minus World article, it states that the Minus Worlds in Super Meat Boy are a reference to an easter egg in Super Mario Bros.
2014-03-04 00:27:29	@Espyo	it's a glitch and everybody knows it
2014-03-04 00:27:31	@Espyo	how even
2014-03-04 00:27:39	@PikFan	...what
2014-03-04 00:29:16	@PikFan	ugh, there's gotta be at least one good wikia out there
2014-03-04 00:29:27	@PikFan	whatever subject it is
2014-03-04 00:29:45	@PikFan	that satisfies the demands of a good wiki
2014-03-04 00:30:13	@PikFan	also speaking of wikia
2014-03-04 00:30:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-04 00:30:22	@Espyo	Carma Wikia is good, but not really that great to be honest
2014-03-04 00:30:31	@PikFan	I remember seeing the user page of a Pikmin wikian
2014-03-04 00:30:32	@Espyo	motivation is kinda dead because of the fact that I have to do it on wikia, tbh
2014-03-04 00:30:58	@PikFan	and it said to use a monobook script so that it isn't an ad barn
2014-03-04 00:31:34	@Espyo	wow
2014-03-04 00:31:42	@PikFan	but they wouldn't have to use a script if they could suck up their pride and just move here
2014-03-04 00:32:28	@PikFan	I still don't understand why they think quantity > quality
2014-03-04 00:33:09	@PikFan	but Pikipedia is catching up, no doubt
2014-03-04 00:33:13	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-04 00:33:24	@PikFan	ever since I got P3 we've been making great progress
2014-03-04 00:33:30	@Espyo	great, but slow
2014-03-04 00:33:37	@PikFan	right
2014-03-04 00:33:55	@Espyo	also is it really because that guy is proud, or because he just doesn't know about Pikipedia?
2014-03-04 00:34:10	@Espyo	remember we're kinda "2nd-google-page" material
2014-03-04 00:34:10	@PikFan	...both?
2014-03-04 00:34:22	@Espyo	maybe both, yeah
2014-03-04 00:34:47	@PikFan	yeah but that's because wikia firstly is waaaay more popular than Pikipedia, so more visitors
2014-03-04 00:34:52	@PikFan	and then snowball effect
2014-03-04 00:35:16	@PikFan	while the Pikipedia "snowball" is in a sweltering desert
2014-03-04 00:35:39	@PikFan	...what the
2014-03-04 00:35:53	@PikFan	a user in #mwchat joined and is saying weird things
2014-03-04 00:36:19	@PikFan	16:34	ethan	hi 16:34	ethan	just talk wiki dude! 16:35	ethan	im reportin you wiki 16:35	ethan	...

2014-03-04 00:40:02	@Espyo	recently I've seen a change
2014-03-04 00:40:25	@Espyo	like when you edit, the summary box and the info below it is in gray
2014-03-04 00:40:38	@Espyo	but the edit button is still in its usual place
2014-03-04 00:41:06	@PikFan	no, I mean, in the headers
2014-03-04 00:41:20	@PikFan	the edit button with the brackets around it
2014-03-04 00:41:37	@PikFan	you know, the edit button to edit just a section?
2014-03-04 00:41:40	@PikFan	it's moved
2014-03-04 00:41:53	@PikFan	and it's good because the game icons don't block it anymore
2014-03-04 00:42:06	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sunseed_Berry#In_Pikmin_3
2014-03-04 00:42:15	@PikFan	the game icon isn't blocking
2014-03-04 00:42:45	@Espyo	oh
2014-03-04 00:42:53	@Espyo	uh, I think I noticed that, actually
2014-03-04 00:42:59	@Espyo	but I was busy talking to someone so disregarded it
2014-03-04 00:43:25	@Espyo	ok, this is the part where we try to understand what the hell is going on
2014-03-04 00:44:00	@Espyo	my crazy theory: I changed passwords a few days ago, and because I'm a patroller, I somehow have enough power to influence the entire wiki with my settings, even though I didn't touch any settings when I changed the password
2014-03-04 00:44:56	@PikFan	crazy
2014-03-04 01:12:28	@Espyo	ok, I can't do a recursion inside a loop
2014-03-04 01:12:33	@Espyo	I think that's a sign I should go to bed
2014-03-04 01:12:56	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-03-04 01:13:07	@PikFan	recursion insideâ€”?
2014-03-04 01:13:21	@PikFan	something programming-related, I'm guessing
2014-03-04 01:14:19	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-04 01:14:38	@PikFan	ah

2014-03-04 19:54:40	TPM	I'll see what I can do

2014-03-04 19:55:06	@Espyo	so don't be afraid of doing a low quality job, it's still very appreciated
2014-03-04 19:55:07	TPM	I have the game, so I have the knowledge

2014-03-04 19:57:42	@Espyo	in fact, I'm a patroller there
2014-03-04 19:57:49	TPM	I always rollbacked it
2014-03-04 19:57:53	@Espyo	so maybe I can ban them if they did some other horrible things

2014-03-04 20:01:03	@J	I thought there was a message for me
2014-03-04 20:01:04	@Espyo	articles on areas, fruits, and enemies are the most important ones
2014-03-04 20:01:06	@Espyo	hey
2014-03-04 20:01:07	@Espyo	there is
2014-03-04 20:01:13	@Espyo	didn't Testyo PM you?
2014-03-04 20:01:18	@J	oh, he PMs now?
2014-03-04 20:01:19	@Espyo	he did, on my end
2014-03-04 20:01:21	@Espyo	yes
2014-03-04 20:01:23	@J	yeah, okay
2014-03-04 20:01:27	@Espyo	it's to make sure people get it

2014-03-04 20:01:35	@J	mrgh, more work for me
2014-03-04 20:01:42	@Espyo	don't look at me
2014-03-04 20:01:45	@Espyo	it was a hard call to make
2014-03-04 20:01:49	@J	but I guess it makes sense-ish
2014-03-04 20:01:57	@Espyo	the old system was good because it just auto reads it
2014-03-04 20:02:05	@Espyo	but could mark stuff as read wrongly
2014-03-04 20:02:11	@Espyo	how in the world could I balance the two?
2014-03-04 20:02:16	@Espyo	either way, there's a new option
2014-03-04 20:02:22	@Espyo	to auto-read it, go back to the old way
2014-03-04 20:02:34	@Espyo	it's still via PM, but you don't need "Testyo memo new"
2014-03-04 20:02:39	@J	hah, yeah, it's true
2014-03-04 20:02:49	@Espyo	I'm keeping the PM method though because it's better for privacy
2014-03-04 20:02:52	@Espyo	it is?
2014-03-04 20:02:57	@Espyo	that's not what surprises me the most
2014-03-04 20:03:06	@Espyo	what surprises me is how in the world?!
2014-03-04 20:03:20	@Espyo	any idea?

2014-03-04 20:03:55	@Espyo	on the Fruit page I created yesterday, everything is fine

2014-03-04 20:04:11	@J	tabs at the top of the page are weird
2014-03-04 20:04:15	@Espyo	beyond all rhyme or reason
2014-03-04 20:04:18	@Espyo	I also noticed that
2014-03-04 20:04:34	@Espyo	and when editing a page, the summary and info next to it have a grey background
2014-03-04 20:04:39	@Espyo	this isn't just us, I've noticed in other wikis
2014-03-04 20:04:48	@Espyo	some days ago, I updated all my passwords everywhere
2014-03-04 20:04:55	@Espyo	and in a number of wikis, I saw this style change

2014-03-04 20:28:47	@J	BTW, why does [[Fruit]] have the template thing with the grid of images right above a table of fruit?
2014-03-04 20:29:05	@J	seems a bit redundant - if you're going to have both, the grid should be at the bottom, like it would be on the fruit pages
2014-03-04 20:29:25	@Espyo	 2 is where it should be, 3 is next to the header

2014-03-04 21:15:33	@Espyo	if not, delete everything and recreate the redir
2014-03-04 21:15:39	@Espyo	but yeah, quite a few units do that
2014-03-04 21:15:46	@Espyo	they're visually the same as another one
2014-03-04 21:15:53	@Espyo	so I have their "file" be a redir
2014-03-04 21:16:07	@Espyo	I could just point to the real file, but that would cause extra work for stuff like when templates are involved
2014-03-04 21:16:18	@Espyo	like on the list of units in the technical data of a cave sublevel
2014-03-04 21:16:45	@Espyo	I have a template that given a cave unit name, it puts the image with that name, gives it a title with that name, and adds a name below it with that name
2014-03-04 21:16:59	@Espyo	so having to specify a name AND a real_file_name... just sucks

2014-03-04 21:21:03	@Espyo	this one isn't technically visually the same, because it has water

2014-03-04 21:30:49	@J	yep
2014-03-04 21:44:08	@J	so, I saw some pretty crazy code today
2014-03-04 21:44:28	@J	an isListOfInts function that's supposed to check if something is an array of integers
2014-03-04 21:44:52	@J	what it actually does is return true for arrays (of anything) and undefined for everything else
2014-03-04 21:45:40	@J	the check it does to see if things are ints explicitly checks for the empty string, then uses isNaN (which is the craziest builtin ever), then calls Math.round
2014-03-04 21:45:48	@J	then accidentally discards the result
2014-03-04 21:46:08	@J	but yeah, speaking of isNaN, go to your browser and pass random things to it
2014-03-04 21:46:19	@J	for example, empty arrays and non-empty arrays

2014-03-04 22:02:19	@J	at least NaN is true and numbers are false

2014-03-04 22:02:47	@Espyo	I honestly have no idea
2014-03-04 22:02:55	@J	did you know the real way to check if something is NaN?
2014-03-04 22:03:51	@Espyo	I would imagine it's builtin, but because it's not, there's some hack
2014-03-04 22:03:53	@Espyo	let's see...
2014-03-04 22:04:20	@Espyo	if converting the thing to a string and then back returns the same
2014-03-04 22:04:39	@Espyo	rather, if it returns something different

2014-03-04 22:04:42	@J	oh
2014-03-04 22:04:49	@J	how do you convert back?
2014-03-04 22:04:50	@Espyo	double negatives
2014-03-04 22:05:00	@Espyo	doesn't JS have a thing for thatâ€” oh right
2014-03-04 22:05:11	@Espyo	hmm
2014-03-04 22:05:20	@Espyo	can you convert anything into a number?
2014-03-04 22:05:41	@J	well, you can do 'Number(anything)'
2014-03-04 22:05:46	@J	but you don't always get a number
2014-03-04 22:06:24	@J	okay, I'll tell you
2014-03-04 22:06:27	@Espyo	precisely
2014-03-04 22:06:30	@J	try 'NaN === NaN'
2014-03-04 22:06:57	@Espyo	you do (Number(thing) === String(thing)â€” ok, I'm lost already
2014-03-04 22:07:10	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-03-04 22:07:19	@Espyo	NaN would be some sort of undefined, then?
2014-03-04 22:07:27	@J	but undefined === undefined
2014-03-04 22:07:34	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-03-04 22:08:12	@J	but letting NaN never be equal to anything is just the most ridiculous thing
2014-03-04 22:08:45	@Espyo	hm
2014-03-04 22:11:58	@Espyo	in other news, nothing about C++'s regex is working for me
2014-03-04 22:12:05	@Espyo	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/
2014-03-04 22:12:07	@J	probably doing wrong
2014-03-04 22:12:18	@Espyo	this says having a while iterates between all search results
2014-03-04 22:12:25	@Espyo	for me, it loops forever
2014-03-04 22:12:41	@Espyo	and also, that foreach (for(auto x:m)) isn't even recognized here, throws a bunch of silly errors
2014-03-04 22:12:52	@J	which one?
2014-03-04 22:12:56	@Espyo	I have to be using C++11... otherwise it wouldn't even recognize <regex>... right?
2014-03-04 22:13:03	@Espyo	uh, wrong link
2014-03-04 22:13:07	@J	I thought auto was C++11
2014-03-04 22:13:14	@Espyo	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/regex_search/
2014-03-04 22:13:17	@Espyo	it is
2014-03-04 22:13:20	@Espyo	and it recognizes auto elsewhere
2014-03-04 22:13:37	@Espyo	but that foreach is just mind-boggling to iâ€” let me guess, it's because it's visual studio's compiler
2014-03-04 22:13:39	@Espyo	let me try g++
2014-03-04 22:15:05	@Espyo	it outputs nothing with g++
2014-03-04 22:15:54	@Espyo	well, g++ compiles, but throws an error
2014-03-04 22:15:56	@Espyo	...good grief
2014-03-04 22:16:29	@Espyo	either -std=gnu++11 or -std=c++11
2014-03-04 22:17:04	@Espyo	http://www.johndcook.com/cpp_regex.html plus this other site doesn't tell me to iterate between m, but instead do m[0], m[1], ...
2014-03-04 22:17:19	@Espyo	even without the foreach, in my tests, no matter what I try, it only finds the first
2014-03-04 22:17:23	@Espyo	why can't C++ ever cooperate
2014-03-04 22:18:26	@J	g++ said terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::regex_error'
2014-03-04 22:18:34	@J	I guess that's probably what you got
2014-03-04 22:18:48	@J	well, I don't know C++
2014-03-04 22:18:55	@Espyo	it is
2014-03-04 22:19:05	@Espyo	I know you don't, but just trying it yourself helps
2014-03-04 22:19:14	@Espyo	because it lets me make sure that nobody has any idea what they're doing
2014-03-04 22:19:23	@Espyo	you'd think the cpp website would know...
2014-03-04 22:25:00	@Espyo	ok, regex_error is for when the regex is malformed
2014-03-04 22:25:10	@Espyo	I simplified it to just "sub"
2014-03-04 22:25:13	@Espyo	and no results
2014-03-04 22:27:10	@J	hmm, the expression looks fine to me
2014-03-04 22:27:32	@Espyo	same...
2014-03-04 22:28:12	@J	I guess just add bits back in until it breaks
2014-03-04 22:28:33	@J	could be the \b, could be ( needs escaping (some engines do it backwards)
2014-03-04 22:28:37	@Espyo	right now I actually want to get anything to work
2014-03-04 22:28:42	@J	I've seen engines that don't support *

2014-03-04 22:28:49	@J	but they all support +

2014-03-04 22:42:57	@Espyo	ok, that still happens

2014-03-05 01:11:15	@Espyo	I think that's meant to be just bufferlength

2014-03-05 01:12:27	Spark	like, if bufferlength is 512, its 512 long, so the last character would be 511 right?
2014-03-05 01:13:22	@Espyo	but you're telling recv() to fill it with bufferlength characters
2014-03-05 01:14:12	Spark	so i should make it actually be 513 long?

2014-03-05 01:20:25	@Espyo	I think that's because you're printing stuff you shouldn't
2014-03-05 01:20:36	@Espyo	one of the characters you can print on the console actually emits a beep
2014-03-05 01:22:13	Spark	all i print is firstword and secondword, which are the first and second words of whatever it receives
2014-03-05 01:22:48	Spark	judging by those, it's not picking up the first word of the ping messages; it recieves a notice and a ping at the same time, and recognizes the first one while ignoring the second
2014-03-05 01:22:57	@Espyo	hmm
2014-03-05 01:23:18	@Espyo	well, it doesn't look like you have a loop

2014-03-05 01:24:25	@Espyo	yeah, but it still doesn't look like it connects to any loop in any way that makes sense
2014-03-05 01:24:41	@Espyo	but if you say so...
2014-03-05 01:24:47	Spark	later on i have    do {     receive();     } while( iResult > 0 );

2014-03-05 19:01:20	@Espyo	about the /index.php thing
2014-03-05 19:01:31	@J	urlencoding isn't the regex part
2014-03-05 19:01:38	@J	you just do all that stuff, then urlencode afterwards
2014-03-05 19:02:14	@Espyo	not quite what I was thinking of
2014-03-05 19:02:19	@Espyo	ok, let's go back a bit
2014-03-05 19:02:29	@Espyo	by urlencoding, you mean...?
2014-03-05 19:02:40	@Espyo	also, there's another thing you haven't tried
2014-03-05 19:02:44	@Espyo	think outside the box for this one
2014-03-05 19:02:52	@Espyo	what other common type of page do we talk about here?
2014-03-05 19:02:55	@Espyo	sometimes "link" to
2014-03-05 19:03:21	@J	AKA percent-encoding
2014-03-05 19:03:34	@J	? -> %3F, ' ' -> %20, etc.
2014-03-05 19:03:39	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-03-05 19:03:39	@Espyo	that
2014-03-05 19:03:45	@Espyo	wouldn't be too hard...ish
2014-03-05 19:03:52	@Espyo	but it would require more specific code
2014-03-05 19:03:59	@Espyo	the current feature just has a regex trigger and a message
2014-03-05 19:04:22	@Espyo	either way, it would just be a fun exercise

2014-03-05 19:27:01	@Espyo	everything about it, the editor, the animation, ...
2014-03-05 19:34:32	@Espyo	...great, I can't remember how Cloaking Burrow-nits die
2014-03-05 19:34:45	@Espyo	and I can't get up to check, because I have my cat in my lap
2014-03-05 19:34:52	@Espyo	and I don't feel like using Dolphin to go kill one
2014-03-05 19:43:30	@J	hmm, looks pretty good
2014-03-05 19:43:40	@Espyo	it's all a bit scary
2014-03-05 19:43:44	@Espyo	that was /too/ easy to make
2014-03-05 19:43:49	@Espyo	err, the animation
2014-03-05 19:43:50	@J	Loa/Sav looks silly, though - missing one letter when there's plenty of space
2014-03-05 19:43:52	@Espyo	the editor was a nightmare
2014-03-05 19:44:02	@Espyo	looks like there is plenty of space, but here isn't
2014-03-05 19:44:12	 *	@Espyo goes to add another letter, but not because J brought that up or anything
2014-03-05 19:44:17	@J	I have no idea what the whole P/P row does
2014-03-05 19:44:36	@Espyo	Play/Pause
2014-03-05 19:44:45	@Espyo	< and > go to the previous and next frames
2014-03-05 19:44:50	@Espyo	+ and - add and remove frames
2014-03-05 19:45:01	@J	then put the standard play/pause icon on it?
2014-03-05 19:45:05	@Espyo	uh, I can have the full word all right, but...
2014-03-05 19:45:08	@Espyo	it's text-only
2014-03-05 19:45:16	@J	hmm
2014-03-05 19:45:17	@Espyo	I could have an icon, but that'd require a resouâ€”
2014-03-05 19:45:20	@Espyo	wait, no it wouldn't
2014-03-05 19:45:25	@Espyo	I can just make my own using primitives
2014-03-05 19:45:47	@Espyo	weird how I never though of it
2014-03-05 19:45:52	@Espyo	but yeah, I made an entire GUI system
2014-03-05 19:45:58	@Espyo	it started promising
2014-03-05 19:46:02	@Espyo	but it went South really quickly
2014-03-05 19:46:10	@J	not really surprising
2014-03-05 19:46:19	@J	I bet it ended up rather specific to this interface
2014-03-05 19:46:23	@J	or at least parts of it
2014-03-05 19:46:30	@Espyo	surprisingly, it didn't
2014-03-05 19:46:46	@Espyo	it's more because there's a lot of problems with all the events widgets can throw
2014-03-05 19:46:53	@Espyo	like mouse out, mouse button up...
2014-03-05 19:47:14	@Espyo	that tiny minus button next to the "attack" button didn't use to be there
2014-03-05 19:47:25	@Espyo	before, you were meant to go to the list of animations and click a button to delete the animation you wanted
2014-03-05 19:47:43	@Espyo	but after deleting, it would clear all animation buttons on the list and create new ones
2014-03-05 19:47:57	@Espyo	...while the button you clicked on still needed to complete its mouse up event
2014-03-05 19:47:59	@Espyo	= boom
2014-03-05 19:48:45	@J	also, it would look a lot better if you used a better font
2014-03-05 19:48:54	@Espyo	it's the built-in font
2014-03-05 19:48:55	@J	so you used an Allegro GUI library in the end?
2014-03-05 19:48:57	@Espyo	now /that/ I can't change
2014-03-05 19:49:03	@Espyo	no library
2014-03-05 19:49:09	@J	oh
2014-03-05 19:49:11	@Espyo	this is still all mine
2014-03-05 19:49:14	@Espyo	besides the font
2014-03-05 19:49:19	@Espyo	I could easily have it have a new font
2014-03-05 19:49:25	@Espyo	but that'd require packaging the engine along with a font
2014-03-05 19:49:29	@Espyo	...why bother?
2014-03-05 19:49:33	@Espyo	Allegro already has a built-in one
2014-03-05 19:49:39	@Espyo	it's not glamorous, but it gets the job done
2014-03-05 19:49:45	@J	but it looks so horrible
2014-03-05 19:49:55	@J	it's like the Windows default command-line font
2014-03-05 19:49:57	@Espyo	...though it makes me wonder how I'll make a title screen without a font
2014-03-05 19:50:06	@Espyo	it really is
2014-03-05 19:50:09	@Espyo	Courier?
2014-03-05 19:50:11	@Espyo	wait, I can check
2014-03-05 19:50:27	@Espyo	err, Lucida Console
2014-03-05 19:50:31	@Espyo	it's a bit like that, but bolder
2014-03-05 19:51:52	@J	I always package a font with a game that has anytext
2014-03-05 19:51:56	@J	*any text
2014-03-05 19:52:16	@Espyo	yeah, but if I don't, it's just an executable
2014-03-05 19:52:27	@J	hmm
2014-03-05 19:52:29	@Espyo	besides you're /kinda/ meant to stick the executable alongside a fangame data folder
2014-03-05 19:52:32	@J	but you'll need a README anyway

2014-03-05 19:53:01	@J	and it's nice to have assets separate anyway
2014-03-05 19:53:06	@Espyo	yes
2014-03-05 19:53:19	@Espyo	I'd have like a folder for resources separate from the game data folder

2014-03-05 19:54:33	@J	hey
2014-03-05 19:54:58	@Espyo	hey
2014-03-05 19:55:03	@J	anyway, the only mouse-driven UI I did was buttons in that rumour game thing
2014-03-05 19:55:13	@Espyo	the basic
2014-03-05 19:55:19	@J	I also had them in boxes that you could scroll by clicking buttons at the edges
2014-03-05 19:55:25	@Espyo	oh, neat
2014-03-05 19:55:26	@J	and that was a pain
2014-03-05 19:55:33	@Espyo	I have scrollbars of sorts, too
2014-03-05 19:55:36	@J	then again, I did the whole thing in a few days
2014-03-05 19:55:41	@Espyo	you can use them to scroll stuff inside widgets
2014-03-05 19:55:42	TehPehEhm	I made the area pages
2014-03-05 19:55:46	@Espyo	yeah, you can't just make a GUI thing in a few days
2014-03-05 19:55:48	TehPehEhm	I didn't like them yellow
2014-03-05 19:55:59	@Espyo	lafi, the name I gave to this GUI library thing, took me at least a good two months
2014-03-05 19:56:04	@Espyo	and it's still pretty poor
2014-03-05 19:56:20	@J	the buttons change appearance when held down, though

2014-03-05 19:56:55	@J	yeah, that
2014-03-05 19:57:46	@J	I was considering making some UI stuff for my game engine, but I can't see a good way to make it flexible enough to use in lots of types of games
2014-03-05 19:58:38	@J	I'll probably just do the input part in an abstract way - you specify possibly overlapping shapes, maybe with parenting, and you get mouse events
2014-03-05 19:58:56	@J	maybe provide something to do natural ordering between a set of those shapes too?
2014-03-05 19:59:06	@J	like, for keyboard navigation between UI controls
2014-03-05 19:59:31	@Espyo	 19:56	Espyo	there's a lot of patchy code
2014-03-05 19:59:34	@Espyo	that didn't go through

2014-03-06 01:31:28	@PikFan	it's okay though, these are just the beginnings
2014-03-06 01:31:37	TPM	I know
2014-03-06 01:31:43	TPM	I'll improve upon my mistakes
2014-03-06 01:31:56	@PikFan	no, it's not that
2014-03-06 01:32:06	@PikFan	it's just most new articles start out rough
2014-03-06 01:32:14	TPM	No, I know that
2014-03-06 01:32:22	TPM	But I'm still learning from my mistakes
2014-03-06 01:32:27	@PikFan	right
2014-03-06 01:32:39	@PikFan	just a learning experience
2014-03-06 01:32:51	TPM	So earlier, a user named Meisterbot was here, and I had a channel named #meisterbot, and him and I were both ops
2014-03-06 01:32:57	TPM	Then he somehow kicked me
2014-03-06 01:33:01	@PikFan	see, when I first joined 3 years ago, I had no wiki experience
2014-03-06 01:33:03	@PikFan	wait what
2014-03-06 01:33:08	TPM	What's ironic is that he is my own bot xD
2014-03-06 01:33:27	TPM	I attempted to make a bot like Testyo
2014-03-06 01:33:28	@PikFan	did you make him kick you
2014-03-06 01:33:31	TPM	no
2014-03-06 01:33:39	TPM	He kicked me himself somehow xD
2014-03-06 01:33:44	TPM	I need to fix him
2014-03-06 01:33:46	@PikFan	weird
2014-03-06 01:33:56	TPM	It was funny
2014-03-06 01:34:46	TPM	I still need to get him to say hello
2014-03-06 01:35:10	TPM	I think I figured out why he wouldn't say it earlier
2014-03-06 01:35:42	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-06 01:35:59	TPM	A file was renamed, and then it removed all of the bot's scripts
2014-03-06 01:36:17	@PikFan	odd
2014-03-06 01:36:54	TPM	I don't think I'll add a greeting system to it, considering Testyo already handles that
2014-03-06 01:37:02	TPM	But I do have an idea for a game for it
2014-03-06 01:37:07	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-06 01:38:59	TPM	It will be challenging to make
2014-03-06 01:39:03	TPM	But I'll attempt it
2014-03-06 01:39:08	TPM	It's a secret, though
2014-03-06 01:39:49	@PikFan	ok, is it me or does this have terrible quality http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_jOQTeGzsc
2014-03-06 01:40:55	TPM	Idk
2014-03-06 01:41:06	@PikFan	oh nvm, it's my headphones acting up
2014-03-06 01:41:19	TPM	Well I'm going to go watch tv, so bye
2014-03-06 01:41:30	TPM	Tomorrow Meisterbot will return!
2014-03-06 01:41:30	@PikFan	bye
2014-03-06 01:41:41	TPM	Cya

2014-03-08 18:27:14	@Espyo	like a mockup of a level in a game

2014-03-08 21:30:50	@Espyo	we want to show we know what we're talking about, we know our internal things
2014-03-08 21:30:54	Spark	thats why i suggest using the texture from the game, but with a layer of green to make it darker
2014-03-08 21:30:56	@Espyo	plus we want it to be as Pikmin-related as possible
2014-03-08 21:31:03	Spark	but thats just me *shroog*
2014-03-08 21:31:07	@Espyo	some generic grass doesn't have the same power, despite looking nice
2014-03-08 21:31:11	Meisterbot	k
2014-03-08 21:31:15	@Espyo	oh, and in regards to that change
2014-03-08 21:31:18	@Espyo	I'll note ite
2014-03-08 21:31:21	@Espyo	*it
2014-03-08 21:31:35	@Espyo	my plan is to, after a winner is decided, grab it and change the hue and lighting a bit
2014-03-08 21:31:43	@Espyo	and then have another pool for the one that looks best
2014-03-08 21:31:53	Meisterbot	when will a winner be decided?
2014-03-08 21:31:54	Spark	oh that's a great idea
2014-03-08 21:32:09	@Espyo	...eventually :P
2014-03-08 21:32:19	@Espyo	after enough people vote to have a fairly decent pool of votes
2014-03-08 21:32:22	Meisterbot	k
2014-03-08 21:33:16	@Espyo	in fact, I pointed out you should ignore any potential changes
2014-03-08 21:33:24	Meisterbot	k
2014-03-08 21:33:42	Spark	yeah that's why i voted for the third one
2014-03-08 21:34:04	Spark	if it were to be unchanged, i would have voted for 6, despite it not being from pikmin, since it looks best
2014-03-08 21:34:11	Spark	(as is)
2014-03-08 21:34:23	Meisterbot	k

2014-03-08 21:37:31	Spark	you can use $+ to merge $nick with !
2014-03-08 21:37:52	Spark	so instead of $nick ! just do $nick $+ ! and itll have no space in between

2014-03-09 18:58:14	@Espyo	too many false positives

2014-03-09 18:58:56	@Espyo	after a winner is picked... eventually, I'll mock up some variations of it

2014-03-09 19:52:34	@PikFan	ok I am getting frustrated
2014-03-09 19:54:59	@Espyo	so if you use a gamepad's analog stick to control the cursor
2014-03-09 19:55:20	@Espyo	what's happening is that it's moving the "mouse cursor", and the "leader cursor" is dragged along, until it reaches the maximum distance
2014-03-09 19:55:24	@Espyo	just like with mouse control
2014-03-09 19:55:36	@Espyo	but if you're holding the analog stick all the way, the cursor reaches the limit
2014-03-09 19:55:47	@Espyo	and the game considers it as being outside the limit, because of rounding errors, I presume
2014-03-09 19:55:58	@Espyo	...so I added +1 to the distance as a hack
2014-03-09 19:56:00	@Espyo	I feel so dirty

2014-03-09 20:00:39	@J	what happens when the cursor goes past the limit?
2014-03-09 20:00:51	@Espyo	just changes to an "invalid spot" cursor
2014-03-09 20:00:59	@J	why not just let you throw anyway?
2014-03-09 20:01:02	@Espyo	which is the same 4-arcs-thing, but translucent
2014-03-09 20:01:05	@Espyo	it does
2014-03-09 20:01:07	@J	oh
2014-03-09 20:01:09	@Espyo	it's just aesthetic
2014-03-09 20:01:10	@J	you just don't want to
2014-03-09 20:01:11	@J	yeah
2014-03-09 20:01:12	@J	hmm
2014-03-09 20:01:21	@Espyo	plus I want to reuse this "invalid spot" cursor for another thing
2014-03-09 20:01:37	@Espyo	from above, it's hard to tell if the Pikmin you're throwing are going to hit a ledge up above
2014-03-09 20:01:44	@Espyo	so I can use that cursor if the ledge is out of reach for the current Pikmin
2014-03-09 20:01:51	@Espyo	that and high enemy hitboxes, like a Beady Long Legs
2014-03-09 20:02:03	@J	so, the A-stick moves the cursor

2014-03-09 20:02:33	@J	you're detecting a limit on A-stick motion, but not mouse motion?
2014-03-09 20:02:51	@Espyo	because the mouse can and should move freely
2014-03-09 20:02:56	@J	so what's probably happening is that the check comes after it's moved, so it's already outside by a few px
2014-03-09 20:03:07	@Espyo	and there's a distinction between your actual cursor and the cursor the leader has
2014-03-09 20:03:13	@J	yeah
2014-03-09 20:03:16	@Espyo	but in analog stick mode, they're the same
2014-03-09 20:03:22	@Espyo	so might as well use the classic GameCube method
2014-03-09 20:03:33	@Espyo	yeah, I think that's what happens
2014-03-09 20:03:35	@Espyo	I thought of that
2014-03-09 20:03:51	@Espyo	plus this hack isn't very effective, it's still considered "invalid" if you're holding the stick
2014-03-09 20:03:56	@J	so it could be more than 1px, depending on cursor speed
2014-03-09 20:04:23	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-09 20:04:27	@J	I guess you're just doing A-stick magnitude px per frame ATM
2014-03-09 20:04:34	@J	which is why 1 would work
2014-03-09 20:04:42	@J	since magnitude <= 1
2014-03-09 20:05:53	@Espyo	the very first thing it does is move
2014-03-09 20:05:58	@Espyo	(the cursor)
2014-03-09 20:06:03	@Espyo	but the check checks with the move
2014-03-09 20:06:50	@J	so you must be doing the clamping check and cursor icon checks differently?
2014-03-09 20:06:52	@Espyo	I don't think I even put the hack in the right place
2014-03-09 20:07:27	@Espyo	getting confused by my own code here
2014-03-09 20:07:31	@Espyo	I think it needs a rewrite, anyway

2014-03-10 01:17:56	@PikFan	.
2014-03-10 01:18:10	@PikFan	so I'm ungrounded from the computer now
2014-03-10 01:27:54	@Espyo	hehe
2014-03-10 01:30:44	@PikFan	now I can continue working on my fruits spreadsheet
2014-03-10 01:31:29	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-10 01:31:53	@PikFan	bingo battle's going to be hard though, since the layouts shuffle
2014-03-10 01:32:03	@Espyo	oh
2014-03-10 01:32:04	@Espyo	hmm
2014-03-10 01:32:09	@Espyo	wonder if it uses a cave system like Pikmin 2
2014-03-10 01:32:21	@PikFan	there are only 3 variations
2014-03-10 01:32:22	@Espyo	*unit system
2014-03-10 01:33:00	@PikFan	actually the layouts themselves don't change
2014-03-10 01:33:07	@PikFan	the things in them do
2014-03-10 01:33:16	@Espyo	oh
2014-03-10 01:33:20	@Espyo	hey, also
2014-03-10 01:33:26	@Espyo	you said there's an icon for the other fruit, but it's smaller
2014-03-10 01:33:29	@Espyo	here's a thing you can do:
2014-03-10 01:33:34	@Espyo	give me a LOAD of screenshots
2014-03-10 01:33:44	@Espyo	I'll crop and paste the bits that lack sparkle particles
2014-03-10 01:34:03	@PikFan	yeah, Golden Sunseed and Golden Grenade
2014-03-10 01:34:16	@PikFan	basically golden strawberries and cherries
2014-03-10 01:35:34	@PikFan	how many do you think you need?
2014-03-10 01:35:44	@Espyo	probably 20+
2014-03-10 01:35:49	@Espyo	just to be safe
2014-03-10 01:35:55	@Espyo	are the icons in the same position all the time?
2014-03-10 01:36:02	@Espyo	and how intense are the particles?
2014-03-10 01:36:12	@Espyo	like just the occasional star, or does it have a constant shower of them?
2014-03-10 01:36:28	@PikFan	it's like one every second
2014-03-10 01:36:33	@PikFan	I'm booting it up now
2014-03-10 01:36:56	@Espyo	oh
2014-03-10 01:37:00	@Espyo	in that case 5 should do
2014-03-10 01:37:10	@Espyo	see if you can grab a screenie with no particles, though
2014-03-10 01:37:20	@PikFan	uh
2014-03-10 01:37:29	@PikFan	actually more like 2-3 every second
2014-03-10 01:37:51	@PikFan	and I hadn't realized how close together the fruits are on the map, so I'll have to â€” OH
2014-03-10 01:37:57	@PikFan	of course!
2014-03-10 01:38:18	@PikFan	well it's a good thing there are multiple fruit for each level
2014-03-10 01:40:37	@Espyo	"of course!" what?
2014-03-10 01:41:10	@PikFan	well it'll be easier for you if I can group together multiple fruit
2014-03-10 01:41:18	@PikFan	each with different sparkles
2014-03-10 01:41:36	@Espyo	oh, you can gather more than one Golden Sunseed or Golden Grenade?
2014-03-10 01:41:48	@PikFan	mhm
2014-03-10 01:41:52	@PikFan	let's see...
2014-03-10 01:42:01	@Espyo	hm, but chances are the sparkles are in sync
2014-03-10 01:42:20	@Espyo	it's easier to store one variable that controls how long until the next particle spawn, than it is to store one for each icon
2014-03-10 01:43:02	@PikFan	no, they're different for each fruit
2014-03-10 01:43:10	@PikFan	aaaand I just noticed a problem
2014-03-10 01:43:27	@PikFan	there's a golden ring around each fruit
2014-03-10 01:43:35	@Espyo	hmm...
2014-03-10 01:51:10	@PikFan	so do you want me to upload them to Pikipedia?>
2014-03-10 01:51:13	@PikFan	*- >
2014-03-10 01:52:03	@Espyo	sure
2014-03-10 01:56:02	@PikFan	already got 2 up
2014-03-10 01:59:46	@PikFan	4 up
2014-03-10 01:59:49	@PikFan	is that enough?
2014-03-10 01:59:51	@PikFan	or more?
2014-03-10 02:03:14	@PikFan	Espyo?
2014-03-10 02:05:27	@Espyo	let me check
2014-03-10 02:05:43	@Espyo	my ping sound doesn't work at all
2014-03-10 02:05:47	@Espyo	I just don't know why
2014-03-10 02:06:02	@PikFan	did you check your prefs?
2014-03-10 02:06:50	@Espyo	mhm, several times
2014-03-10 02:06:53	@Espyo	checked my dropbox as well
2014-03-10 02:06:57	@Espyo	the file is hosted on my dropbox
2014-03-10 02:07:03	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-10 02:07:08	@Espyo	everything adds up
2014-03-10 02:07:10	@Espyo	but it doesn't work
2014-03-10 02:07:12	@PikFan	I just use the sounds that Mibbit has
2014-03-10 02:07:51	@Espyo	not even that works
2014-03-10 02:07:58	@Espyo	I searched around, and it looks like it's Firefox' problem
2014-03-10 02:08:03	@Espyo	flash isn't playing sounds
2014-03-10 02:08:09	@Espyo	...except it totally is, everywhere else
2014-03-10 02:08:15	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-10 02:08:21	@PikFan	did you try on another browser?
2014-03-10 02:08:30	@Espyo	not yet
2014-03-10 02:08:34	@Espyo	I'd have to log out and log in there
2014-03-10 02:08:37	@Espyo	so that's probably why
2014-03-10 02:09:12	@Espyo	ok, so there's a glow and the stars
2014-03-10 02:09:15	@Espyo	the icons are really small
2014-03-10 02:09:18	@Espyo	but I'll see what I can do
2014-03-10 02:09:42	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-03-10 02:10:01	@PikFan	is 7 enough though
2014-03-10 02:10:04	@Espyo	there should be an easy way to just grab all common pixels on an image
2014-03-10 02:10:06	@Espyo	it is, yeah
2014-03-10 02:10:23	@PikFan	'kay
2014-03-10 02:10:41	@PikFan	well then, I'm keeping Pikmin 3 up; need to work on that table
2014-03-10 02:10:47	@Espyo	yeah

2014-03-10 20:42:53	@J	hmm, didn't notice that
2014-03-10 20:43:05	@J	the !important on the inset is necessary
2014-03-10 20:43:17	@J	because MW now sets it somewhere, I think
2014-03-10 20:43:20	@J	messes something up

2014-03-11 20:32:48	Spark	oh i remember i made a bot like that once
2014-03-11 20:33:04	Spark	it was much worse than testy though and it barely worked :p
2014-03-11 20:33:10	TPM	Hi Spark
2014-03-11 20:33:35	Spark	Hi TPM
2014-03-11 20:33:55	TPM	Meisterbot respond to colors
2014-03-11 20:33:57	TPM	Finally
2014-03-11 20:41:15	TPM	So much text in #testyo
2014-03-11 20:41:20	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-11 20:41:47	TPM	I can't focus on a text file for Meisterbot
2014-03-11 20:44:46	Spark	how come the models on pikipedia are all made of clay?

2014-03-11 21:49:49	@J	[20:19:17] @Espyo J: does Pikipedia have an API?
2014-03-11 21:49:58	@J	 /api.php
2014-03-11 21:50:09	@J	...guess why it took me a while to send that
2014-03-11 21:50:46	@J	can anyone else access GitHub?
2014-03-11 21:50:53	@J	(specifically HTTPS, in case it makes a difference)
2014-03-11 21:56:11	@J	lack of replies is sad

2014-03-11 22:00:00	@Espyo	...
2014-03-11 22:00:10	@Espyo	github is fine

2014-03-11 22:00:20	@Espyo	but https
2014-03-11 22:00:24	@Espyo	anyway, late reply = bad
2014-03-11 22:00:31	@Espyo	I'm already pretty much all done with the HTML method
2014-03-11 22:03:36	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-03-11 22:10:47	@Espyo	well, it's working
2014-03-11 22:10:52	@Espyo	just got to put it in TEstyo
2014-03-11 22:10:55	@Espyo	*e
2014-03-11 22:12:52	@Espyo	so how often should I ask for the recent changes?
2014-03-11 22:16:03	@J	yeah, GitHub's gradually got back to a usable state over the last 30 minutes
2014-03-11 22:16:23	@J	yeah, I did a screen-scraping MediaWiki bot way back
2014-03-11 22:16:33	@J	but you'll encounter issues when stuff changes
2014-03-11 22:16:58	@J	OTOH, it's easier because you can lock down the skin, settings and language used
2014-03-11 22:17:32	@J	I guess any time above 5 minutes is reasonable
2014-03-11 22:17:50	@J	an API request would be lighter, though
2014-03-11 22:18:07	@J	in either case, you can limit by date if you hadn't already noticed
2014-03-11 22:18:21	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&from=20140311221811
2014-03-11 22:18:43	@Espyo	yeah, I was thinking every 5 or 10
2014-03-11 22:18:56	@Espyo	and I'm not going with the HTML method any more
2014-03-11 22:19:03	@Espyo	just realized how horribly horrible it will end up being
2014-03-11 22:19:06	@J	yeah
2014-03-11 22:19:11	@Espyo	it's pretty much done, except everything will fail everywhere
2014-03-11 22:19:17	@Espyo	plus the API just looks super easy
2014-03-11 22:19:21	@Espyo	I was initially put off because of the XML
2014-03-11 22:19:24	@Espyo	didn't want to write a parser
2014-03-11 22:19:25	@J	were you using an HTML parser anyway, or just finding bits in it that look right?
2014-03-11 22:19:31	@Espyo	...but I end up parsing HTML anyway
2014-03-11 22:19:38	@Espyo	err... "parsing"? heh, my bad
2014-03-11 22:19:38	@J	it's not only XML
2014-03-11 22:19:42	@J	try format=
2014-03-11 22:19:52	@Espyo	I meant "brute-forcingly using searches for the stuff that interests me"
2014-03-11 22:19:54	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2014-03-11 22:19:58	@Espyo	default is json, I believe
2014-03-11 22:20:02	@Espyo	Testyo: forget kill
2014-03-11 22:20:06	@Espyo	...
2014-03-11 22:20:07	@Espyo	fine, don't
2014-03-11 22:20:54	@J	XML is easier to parse than HTML anyway
2014-03-11 22:21:02	@J	and you'll find more, better parsers for it
2014-03-11 22:22:01	@Espyo	&rcprop=user|comment|title|ids|sizes seems fine
2014-03-11 22:22:06	@Espyo	yeah, that's true
2014-03-11 22:22:10	@Espyo	I downloaded one at one point
2014-03-11 22:22:19	@Espyo	when I was still experimenting what to do on PK Rhythm for files
2014-03-11 22:22:28	@Espyo	but yeah, simple parsing is enough
2014-03-11 22:22:42	@Espyo	also you're not busy right now because you're talking about parsing XML instead of bashing on it and glorifying JSON
2014-03-11 22:22:43	@Espyo	so...
2014-03-11 22:22:45	@Espyo	vote on poll 6

2014-03-11 22:32:02	@Espyo	it should, shouldn't it

2014-03-11 22:32:18	@Espyo	tech stuff, TPM
2014-03-11 22:32:33	@Espyo	uh, what do you call a thing inside a tag
2014-03-11 22:32:41	@Espyo	like "id" inside a "span"
2014-03-11 22:32:48	@Espyo	span is the tag, id is the __
2014-03-11 22:39:35	@J	yeah, you're right, XML _is_ silly
2014-03-11 22:40:17	@J	mostly because it doesn't really do arrays
2014-03-11 22:40:43	@J	or, you can't tell if a tag could appear more than once (which would effectively make it an array)
2014-03-11 22:41:02	@Espyo	hehe
2014-03-11 22:41:18	@J	yeah, MediaWiki APIs are at /api.php by default, unless explicitly deactivated
2014-03-11 22:41:31	@J	you can set pretty granular rights, though, I think
2014-03-11 22:41:31	@Espyo	I googled, and most are at w/api.php
2014-03-11 22:41:41	@Espyo	...unless it's because the other wikis have their content on w/
2014-03-11 22:41:41	@J	well, only because the wiki's at w/
2014-03-11 22:41:43	@J	yeah
2014-03-11 22:41:46	@Espyo	hm
2014-03-11 22:42:01	@J	if you do edit or something, you generally end up at /w/index.php?title=...&action=...
2014-03-11 22:42:10	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-11 22:42:22	TPM	I'm gonna go
2014-03-11 22:42:31	@J	by default, anyone can use an API, but accounts with bot rights have higher limits
2014-03-11 22:42:32	@J	TPM: bye
2014-03-11 22:42:40	@J	more results per request, etc.

2014-03-11 22:46:59	@Espyo	well, see if you can find it then
2014-03-11 22:47:12	@J	because outside of Windows, redo is generally ctrl-shift-z

2014-03-12 20:23:01	@Espyo	but I can at least explain it was for testing purposes
2014-03-12 20:23:05	@Espyo	anyway, on the fruits, yeah, thanks

2014-03-12 20:23:20	@Espyo	I only ever used the /first/ image, and that was all
2014-03-12 20:23:32	@Espyo	I figured the glow would interfere, but nope
2014-03-12 20:24:14	PikFan	wow
2014-03-12 20:24:24	@Espyo	also, they're smaller rips
2014-03-12 20:24:32	@Espyo	and I thought that would look ugly compared to the other icons
2014-03-12 20:24:45	@Espyo	but I didn't realize that they wouldn't fit on the same table as the others to begin with
2014-03-12 20:24:54	PikFan	oh
2014-03-12 20:24:56	@Espyo	they don't have a juice value, after all
2014-03-12 20:25:07	PikFan	yeah
2014-03-12 20:25:15	@Espyo	it's just that wikia stupidly puts them together

2014-03-13 20:22:50	@Espyo	we might balance out the hue and lighting a bit more

2014-03-13 20:25:54	@Espyo	like there's pages of whatever, designed however
2014-03-13 20:25:58	PikFan	given it's a fanon wiki--therefore unofficial--people tend to ignore structure
2014-03-13 20:26:02	@Espyo	instead of following styles and categorizations and the like

2014-03-14 19:48:58	@Espyo	I know
2014-03-14 19:49:04	@Espyo	just the whole thing
2014-03-14 19:49:31	PikFan	so then
2014-03-14 19:49:53	PikFan	you said Testyo responds to changes on the wikis in a few minutes
2014-03-14 19:50:08	PikFan	is it possible to make it faster?
2014-03-14 19:50:59	PikFan	also, got 15 minutes
2014-03-14 19:50:59	@Espyo	yes, but I won't do it
2014-03-14 19:51:06	@Espyo	it fetches every 5 minutes
2014-03-14 19:51:12	PikFan	I see
2014-03-14 19:51:21	@Espyo	imagine asking the server for stuff every 30 seconds or so
2014-03-14 19:51:23	@Espyo	it'd be horrible
2014-03-14 19:51:34	@Espyo	 5 minutes is enough, really
2014-03-14 19:54:02	PikFan	oh, this kid that I'm friends with
2014-03-14 19:54:18	PikFan	he has a Game Boy emulator on his iPod

2014-03-14 19:56:14	@Espyo	err
2014-03-14 19:56:20	@Espyo	that info is for Pikmin 2
2014-03-14 19:56:29	PikFan	yes, but
2014-03-14 19:56:36	@Espyo	but yeah, it's what we have on [[2-Player Battle#Pikmin seeds]]

2014-03-14 19:57:22	PikFan	t appear
2014-03-14 19:57:27	PikFan	in battle mode
2014-03-14 19:57:31	PikFan	gah enter key
2014-03-14 19:57:36	@Espyo	hm, you're right
2014-03-14 19:57:49	@Espyo	dunno then
2014-03-14 19:57:52	PikFan	are you confusing it with Pikmin
2014-03-14 19:58:02	PikFan	because Wollywogs do appear in Pikmin
2014-03-14 19:58:06	@Espyo	yeah, I know but
2014-03-14 19:58:08	PikFan	TFN
2014-03-14 19:58:13	PikFan	but what?
2014-03-14 19:58:14	@Espyo	I made that edit because of the 2-P article
2014-03-14 19:58:19	PikFan	oh
2014-03-14 19:58:21	@Espyo	without thinking
2014-03-14 19:58:26	@Espyo	I did it on other articles too
2014-03-14 19:58:30	@Espyo	like [[Breadbug]]

2014-03-14 19:58:30	PikFan	right

2014-03-14 21:42:14	@J	so I received my new computer yesterday
2014-03-14 21:42:38	@J	got it delivered to work and got someone there to drive it home for me
2014-03-14 21:42:54	@J	spent about half an hour that evening looking for his car keys which he lost _inside_ his car
2014-03-14 21:44:03	@J	then later I discovered the computer only came with an EU power cable; the monitor came with a UK one which worked (not the power supply, just a kettle lead, in case that sounded unsafe)
2014-03-14 21:44:13	@J	so I got it going with my TV
2014-03-14 21:44:44	@J	sent an email this morning about it, and they're going to deliver a UK cable here tomorrow
2014-03-14 21:48:44	@Espyo	overly complex method
2014-03-14 21:48:47	@Espyo	could as well just go buy it
2014-03-14 21:49:04	@Espyo	heh
2014-03-14 21:56:01	@J	which part, the power cable or the whole thing?

2014-03-14 22:19:44	@Espyo	ok, you need to change the Pikipedia background
2014-03-14 22:19:47	@Espyo	a winner's been decided
2014-03-14 22:22:45	@J	wait, I'm confused
2014-03-14 22:23:01	@J	how do you go buy it without driving?
2014-03-14 22:23:30	@Espyo	uh
2014-03-14 22:23:32	@J	wait, that was for Pikipedia?  I thought it was for Fanon
2014-03-14 22:23:42	@Espyo	...that was for us
2014-03-14 22:23:47	@J	well I know now
2014-03-14 22:23:55	@Espyo	anyway, having it brought to you
2014-03-14 22:23:59	@J	probably should've realised based on the screenshots
2014-03-14 22:24:00	@J	ah
2014-03-14 22:24:01	@Espyo	might as well have went and picked it up yourself
2014-03-14 22:24:04	@Espyo	except convenience
2014-03-14 22:24:18	@J	well, yeah, except deliveries generally only happen on weekdays
2014-03-14 22:24:22	@J	during working hours
2014-03-14 22:24:29	@Espyo	right
2014-03-14 22:24:57	@J	although tomorrow is Saturday, I got an option of delivery day before and only weekdays were listed
2014-03-14 22:26:15	@J	I was quite impressed with the delivery service though: they specify delivery time to within an hour, you can check where the delivery guy is right now with a 15-minutes accuracy, you can choose which day to have it delivered, you can opt to go pick it up from a warehouse instead
2014-03-14 22:26:44	@J	so link me to the winner
2014-03-14 22:26:55	@J	or upload it to Pikipedia, if you haven't already
2014-03-14 22:28:32	@Espyo	neat

2014-03-14 22:28:58	@Espyo	try it around first
2014-03-14 22:29:08	@Espyo	see if you would like to change the hue by 1 point or something
2014-03-14 22:29:16	@Espyo	CSS is just repeat, really
2014-03-14 22:30:23	@J	does it tile?
2014-03-14 22:30:28	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-14 22:30:30	@J	didn't realise it was that small
2014-03-14 22:30:33	@Espyo	it's from the game, so...
2014-03-14 22:30:42	@Espyo	yeah, it's deceiving
2014-03-14 22:30:49	@Espyo	so... good job Nintendo, I guess
2014-03-14 22:31:22	@J	BTW, can't remember, is this the one I voted for?
2014-03-14 22:31:42	@Espyo	let me check
2014-03-14 22:32:06	@Espyo	you voted for the 3rd option
2014-03-14 22:32:08	@Espyo	uh, this one
2014-03-14 22:32:09	@Espyo	Testyo: poll 6
2014-03-14 22:32:10	Testyo	Poll #6: http://89.154.23.241:8080/Pikipedia/polls#6
2014-03-14 22:32:27	@Espyo	that was my vote too
2014-03-14 22:32:47	@Espyo	one guy that voted for the lighter variant said it's because it makes the sidebar easier to read
2014-03-14 22:32:52	@Espyo	so maybe we can change the color there as well

2014-03-14 22:45:29	@J	hmm, doesn't look any easier to read to me
