2014-03-14 22:49:26	@J	why no logo in your screenshots, BTW?
2014-03-14 22:49:55	@Espyo	apparently it's borderline impossible to have CSS rules that link to local files
2014-03-14 22:50:02	@Espyo	so I decided to save the page on my hard drive

2014-03-14 22:50:09	@Espyo	and for some really weird reason the logo didn't go with it
2014-03-14 22:50:11	@Espyo	everything else did
2014-03-14 22:50:25	@Espyo	$#10; huh?
2014-03-14 22:52:19	@J	I generally just upload the file when I do that
2014-03-14 22:52:43	@Espyo	yeah, but with so many variations, Dropbox would probably start suspecting
2014-03-14 22:52:55	@Espyo	not really, but it doesn't match the convenience of just linking to the bleeding file

2014-03-14 22:55:22	@J	suspecting?
2014-03-14 22:55:31	@J	are you not allowed to use it in that way?
2014-03-14 22:55:48	@Espyo	it actually does lock access to your files from the outside, temporarily, if there's too much traffic
2014-03-14 22:55:50	@J	guess you could always run a local HTTP server and use localhost: URLs
2014-03-14 22:55:56	@J	hmm
2014-03-14 22:55:59	@Espyo	that could also work
2014-03-14 22:59:07	@J	with Python, you can do 'python -m http.server' and you get a server that serves files in the current directory
2014-03-14 23:00:14	@J	hmm, looking at it on the site, the background would need some more work
2014-03-14 23:00:21	@J	you can't see personal links
2014-03-14 23:00:29	@J	the logo colour doesn't match well
2014-03-14 23:00:37	@Espyo	yeah, we were meant to change the color of the personal links
2014-03-14 23:00:46	@J	the content background is too see-through, and too bright when it's not
2014-03-14 23:01:03	@J	other colours don't really look quite right, IMO, but they're bearable compared to that stuff
2014-03-14 23:01:24	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-03-14 23:02:02	@J	hmm, the personal links don't really look very clear with any colour
2014-03-14 23:02:07	@J	maybe they need a background
2014-03-14 23:03:18	@Espyo	white bolded is ok

2014-03-14 23:08:32	@J	logo's still off
2014-03-14 23:08:38	@J	not sure what to do about the content BG
2014-03-14 23:09:12	@Espyo	looks nice
2014-03-14 23:09:17	@J	a full redesign from scratch would be nice, but there's no-one with both the time and the skills
2014-03-14 23:09:18	@Espyo	though maybe we should try the ligher variant
2014-03-14 23:09:21	@Espyo	*lighter
2014-03-14 23:09:27	@J	which part?
2014-03-14 23:09:33	@J	oh, you mean the BG
2014-03-14 23:09:36	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-14 23:09:47	@J	care to upload?
2014-03-14 23:10:08	@Espyo	on top of the dark variant?
2014-03-14 23:10:13	@Espyo	or a separate file?
2014-03-14 23:10:33	@J	either
2014-03-14 23:10:45	@J	I have it uploaded to the wiki already, as you can see in the screenshot
2014-03-14 23:10:47	@J	and from Testyo
2014-03-14 23:11:15	@Espyo	done and purged
2014-03-14 23:11:33	@J	do you mean 4 or 1?
2014-03-14 23:11:50	@J	okay, 1, it seems
2014-03-14 23:11:54	@Espyo	huh?
2014-03-14 23:11:57	@Espyo	should be 4
2014-03-14 23:12:26	@J	wait, no, this file didn't change
2014-03-14 23:12:36	@J	G8b.png?
2014-03-14 23:13:14	@Espyo	G8c.png
2014-03-14 23:13:28	@Espyo	G8c is the lighter

2014-03-14 23:13:30	@Espyo	b is the darker
2014-03-14 23:14:27	@J	...you didn't tell me which file
2014-03-14 23:14:35	@J	so I assumed you uploaded over the other
2014-03-14 23:14:39	@Espyo	I am so confused right now
2014-03-14 23:14:43	@Espyo	I did upload over the other

2014-03-14 23:17:02	@Espyo	hm
2014-03-14 23:17:07	@Espyo	I don't dislike it, but I prefer the darker one
2014-03-14 23:19:43	@J	what do you think about the other stuff, then?
2014-03-14 23:19:44	@J	logo/colours
2014-03-14 23:20:04	@Espyo	gotta return to the darker one to judge right, then
2014-03-14 23:22:06	@Espyo	should I revert the image?

2014-03-14 23:38:01	@Espyo	 224,255,224,0.9 seems pretty ok for the sidebar rectangles
2014-03-14 23:38:09	@Espyo	the ones that contain the links to the tools
2014-03-14 23:45:07	@Espyo	the Pikipedia logo is fine, but should lose the white glow in the future

2014-03-15 00:00:09	@Espyo	so try that for the sidebar, and mess around with the coloring on the main div
2014-03-15 00:00:13	@Espyo	see if you can find anything
2014-03-15 00:00:27	@J	lose the white glow?
2014-03-15 00:00:34	@J	I thought that was okay
2014-03-15 00:00:48	@J	just the main colour doesn't go with the BG colour
2014-03-15 00:01:32	@Espyo	really?
2014-03-15 00:01:35	@Espyo	you mean the faint green?

2014-03-15 01:01:52	@J	the discrete GPU renders offscreen then passes frames to the integrated GPU to show, so it can go much faster

2014-03-17 02:26:40	@Espyo	and I'll be sure as hell to use everything I learned from us to make sure nobody ever steps foot on the old one
2014-03-17 02:26:52	@Espyo	I could move it to a fan domain, some fans asked me if I wanted already
2014-03-17 02:26:54	@PikFan	afaik the Fanon wikia is dead
2014-03-17 02:27:09	@PikFan	let me check
2014-03-17 02:27:11	@Espyo	...but that could end up in the same place as Pikipedia: not the first spot on a Google search
2014-03-17 02:27:27	@Espyo	so having it hosted under the official website will be a huge help
2014-03-17 02:27:43	@Espyo	plus it allows more control, it's closer to home, etc.
2014-03-17 02:27:52	@Espyo	unlike Nintendo, these guys are really close to the community
2014-03-17 02:27:59	@Espyo	so they might just make the fan wiki official
2014-03-17 02:28:16	@Espyo	it was discussed before, but I believe it was rejected because they couldn't really be bothered to check how to do it
2014-03-17 02:28:21	@Espyo	but now that I need it...
2014-03-17 02:28:30	@Espyo	speaking of which, who would I have to talk to if I need to give them help?
2014-03-17 02:28:32	@Espyo	Porple?
2014-03-17 02:28:46	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-03-17 02:29:04	@PikFan	also checked the RC of the old Fanon
2014-03-17 02:29:10	Spark	<Espyo> : if this succeeds, it's a small victory against wikia <Espyo> : and I'll be sure as hell to use everything I learned from us to make sure nobody ever steps foot on the old one
2014-03-17 02:29:12	@PikFan	and there are some edits
2014-03-17 02:29:28	Spark	ohhh were you the one who got demoted because you put in the sitenotice that pikipedia was moving?
2014-03-17 02:29:28	@PikFan	but not nearly as many as the current one
2014-03-17 02:29:44	@Espyo	I wasn't the one, no
2014-03-17 02:29:45	Spark	i remember hearing about that way back
2014-03-17 02:29:52	@Espyo	hmm, can't remember who it was
2014-03-17 02:29:54	@PikFan	ulgh http://pikminfanon.wikia.com/wiki/Denver,_Colorado
2014-03-17 02:30:08	Spark	oh right i think it was picklesomething
2014-03-17 02:30:15	@PikFan	Greenpickle
2014-03-17 02:30:17	@Espyo	Greenpickle? that's J
2014-03-17 02:30:17	@PikFan	J
2014-03-17 02:30:23	@Espyo	haha that page
2014-03-17 02:30:27	@PikFan	and he didn't get demoted...
2014-03-17 02:30:29	@PikFan	right?
2014-03-17 02:30:45	Spark	i mean on wikia
2014-03-17 02:30:56	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-17 02:31:03	@PikFan	I don't think he got demoted
2014-03-17 02:31:07	Spark	hm
2014-03-17 02:31:08	@Espyo	same
2014-03-17 02:31:22	@Espyo	plus recently, J said he got demoted by somebody on wikia
2014-03-17 02:31:27	@Espyo	from sysop and admin to just sysop
2014-03-17 02:31:30	@Espyo	...but he's still admin
2014-03-17 02:31:33	@Espyo	so that's just idiotic
2014-03-17 02:31:40	Spark	im not sure why i was thinking that, then
2014-03-17 02:31:48	Spark	admin is sysop on wikia
2014-03-17 02:31:52	@PikFan	what I do know is that the admins/'crats at Fanon got demoted because they left
2014-03-17 02:31:55	Spark	they renamed sysop to admin for some reason
2014-03-17 02:32:08	@PikFan	one got banned for anti-wikia stuff
2014-03-17 02:32:20	Spark	i tried moving fantendo from wikia to shoutwiki a thousand times
2014-03-17 02:32:30	Spark	but we never even got to the stage where wikia tried to stop us
2014-03-17 02:32:37	Spark	the community was too split on it
2014-03-17 02:33:25	@Espyo	or something of the sort, if it wasn't admin+sysop
2014-03-17 02:36:12	@Espyo	the pre-alpha for the new game is already out
2014-03-17 02:36:17	@Espyo	and there's info that could be documented already
2014-03-17 02:36:22	@Espyo	but I can't...
2014-03-17 02:36:30	@Espyo	ugh..
2014-03-17 02:36:31	@Espyo	*.
2014-03-17 02:36:38	@Espyo	it's bad enough stressing out over one wikia mishap
2014-03-17 02:36:43	@Espyo	now I've got two
2014-03-17 02:36:52	@Espyo	damn you wikia
2014-03-17 02:36:56	@Espyo	damn you infinite times
2014-03-17 02:37:42	Spark	wikia sucks 
2014-03-17 02:38:32	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Brittany by Spark (-105 m removed incorrect information; i havent ...) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Brittany&curid=8301&diff=78810&oldid=78808
2014-03-17 02:39:16	@Espyo	Testyo: memo J who would I need to talk about regarding the most backendish wiki stuff? Porple?
2014-03-17 02:39:16	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for J saying: who would I need to talk about regarding the most backendish wiki stuff? Porple?.
2014-03-17 02:39:32	Spark	porple?
2014-03-17 02:39:40	Spark	like, porplemontage? mariowiki founder guy?
2014-03-17 02:39:42	@PikFan	Porplemontage
2014-03-17 02:39:53	Spark	woah i didnt know he still existed
2014-03-17 02:39:53	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-17 02:39:57	@PikFan	he hosts a few wikis
2014-03-17 02:40:10	@Espyo	he's the guy that's hosting Mariowiki, Pikipedia and Fanon
2014-03-17 02:40:43	@Espyo	at least I can rest easy knowing there won't be a community split like with us
2014-03-17 02:41:00	@Espyo	that split mostly happened because people digged out the old one to place Pikmin 3 info on
2014-03-17 02:41:11	@Espyo	this time, the new game info will be on the old wiki already
2014-03-17 02:41:27	@Espyo	and more importantly, I have the power to change all existing links on the forum and edit them to the new wiki
2014-03-17 02:41:38	@Espyo	plus I can always tell people, out of wikia, to stop using the old place
2014-03-17 02:41:44	@Espyo	and I'll monitor it more carefully
2014-03-17 02:42:00	@Espyo	but still, having it as an official wiki would be incredible
2014-03-17 02:42:19	@Espyo	brb, but going to bed soon
2014-03-17 02:43:21	Spark	is it cool if i add class="spoiler" to the spoiler template? it wouldnt affect anything, but i'm going to make a show/hide script which would require that i think
2014-03-17 02:51:09	@Espyo	sure
2014-03-17 02:51:16	@Espyo	there's been discussion about spoilers recently, actually
2014-03-17 02:51:17	@Espyo	kinda
2014-03-17 02:51:35	@Espyo	about the fact that spoiler warning shouldn't exist because it's in a wiki's nature to contain them
2014-03-17 02:51:40	@Espyo	but I for one vote on how silly that is
2014-03-17 02:51:55	@Espyo	we have images on stuff that gets unlocked when you 100% the game, like the change to the ship in Pikmin 2
2014-03-17 02:52:17	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure most people who just want to know some basic info on the ship, and are only like midway through the game, wouldn't want to be spoiled
2014-03-17 02:52:25	@Espyo	so let's at least save the bigger spoilers inside spoiler boxes
2014-03-17 02:52:28	@Espyo	oh, that reminds me
2014-03-17 02:52:33	Spark	yeah i agree
2014-03-17 02:52:36	@Espyo	I think we already have a spoiler class of sort
2014-03-17 02:52:37	@Espyo	*sorts

2014-03-17 02:54:48	Spark	and firefox
2014-03-17 02:54:56	@Espyo	I mostly meant per-page JS
2014-03-17 02:55:00	@Espyo	yeah, Firefox here too
2014-03-17 02:55:28	@Espyo	maybe it hasn't finished loading the JS?
2014-03-17 02:55:34	@Espyo	or maybe your JS overrides the existing JS
2014-03-17 02:55:46	@Espyo	...3AM, wow
2014-03-17 02:55:53	Spark	my JS is empty at the moment
2014-03-17 02:56:02	@Espyo	might still override it

2014-03-19 21:21:15	Prezintenden	there are things that are very useful to know, but "you can kill this and this for lots of stuff" is extremely arbitrary. I don't think there would be much to write in a strategy space that isn't already important enough to be on another page already
2014-03-19 21:21:23	@Espyo	agreed
2014-03-19 21:22:55	Spark	by the way, espy: SFML has hitboxes and stuff implimented, but it can only detect when hitboxes /intersect/, rather than detecting when they actually collide. currently what im going is moving the hitbox by 1 pixel to test for collision and then moving it back, do you know of a better way to do it?
2014-03-19 21:23:40	@Espyo	well, for collisions, you want intersections, really
2014-03-19 21:23:53	@Espyo	if you want stuff to bounce off, you move the hitboxes right after an intersect is detected
2014-03-19 21:24:23	Spark	well, what i want is for the protagonist to not sink into the floor before it realizes there's been a collision, thats all
2014-03-19 21:24:34	@Espyo	that shouldn't happen
2014-03-19 21:24:49	@Espyo	if the character's hitboxes intersect the floors, move the character to the top of the floor
2014-03-19 21:24:57	@Espyo	that's all done before the next frame is drawn
2014-03-19 21:25:02	@Espyo	so the character is never drawn inside the ground
2014-03-19 21:25:22	Spark	so... essentially what im doing now is ok?
2014-03-19 21:25:32	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-19 21:25:57	@Espyo	alternately, you simulate the move into the new spot, and if there's an intersection, abort
2014-03-19 21:26:02	@Espyo	but that's not really the best approach
2014-03-19 21:28:21	Spark	okay
2014-03-19 21:28:25	Spark	thanks for the help n.n

2014-03-21 21:28:46	@PikFan	I read something on the CC wiki about the heart-shaped GCs
2014-03-21 21:29:31	@PikFan	there was a rumor that the ones pointing up were Golden Cookies, and the ones pointing down were Wrath Cookies
2014-03-21 21:29:37	@PikFan	the wiki said it was false
2014-03-21 21:29:55	@PikFan	but I've studied the cookies, and it's true
2014-03-21 21:30:16	@PikFan	(actually the rumor was in the comments section, not the article)
2014-03-21 21:30:35	@PikFan	don't know why people would falsify something true
2014-03-21 21:32:30	@PikFan	anyway, outside, back later

2014-03-21 21:48:53	@Espyo	I don't click them often, but whenever I do, upside-right are Goldens, pointy-side-up are Wrath
2014-03-21 21:48:58	@Espyo	without fail
2014-03-21 21:49:06	@Espyo	of course, sometimes pointy-side-up cookies give me good rewards

2014-03-21 23:30:06	@Espyo	"goofy"
2014-03-21 23:30:21	@Espyo	we could have a static image, that'd be more apt

2014-03-22 22:06:18	@J	like lots of physics-based puzzle games, the flexibility of a full physics engine makes it really hard to make solid puzzles
2014-03-22 22:07:09	@J	Vessel doesn't quite manage it - it's fun, but there are situations where you know what to do but the physics is being wrong
2014-03-22 22:08:00	@J	it's also sometimes not great at showing changes in state - I've completed things without realising, and continued trying them for a while

2014-03-23 12:55:03	@J	okay, so last night's dream
2014-03-23 12:55:17	@J	I was at my parents' house
2014-03-23 12:55:36	@J	and my mum was complaining at me about something being broken
2014-03-23 12:56:08	@J	I asked how she knew something was broken, and she said something incomprehensible and held out a small bag
2014-03-23 12:56:34	@J	I said, 'oh, that's just a bag of spare stuff from my new computer' - you know, like a bag of screws
2014-03-23 12:56:45	@J	I looked closer, and inside there were lots of tiny forks and spoons
2014-03-23 12:56:56	@J	what does that even mean?
2014-03-23 12:57:16	@J	also, there was someone just lying on the floor in my room
2014-03-23 12:59:27	TZB	i think so
2014-03-23 12:59:28	@Espyo	means you're hungry
2014-03-23 13:09:45	@J	but how could you eat anything with such tiny utensils?
2014-03-23 13:11:00	@Espyo	lil' tiny snacks
2014-03-23 13:11:07	@Espyo	lil' squares of cheese and ham
2014-03-23 13:11:11	@Espyo	lil' sausages too

2014-03-24 00:58:39	@PikFan	when it was a user being created
2014-03-24 00:58:39	@Espyo	it's not an error
2014-03-24 00:58:47	@Espyo	I can make a special case for user creation
2014-03-24 00:58:53	@Espyo	but other than that, it's what the wiki returns
2014-03-24 00:58:57	@Espyo	it's not Testyo's fault
2014-03-24 00:59:03	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-24 00:59:07	@Espyo	the thing is that the wiki also returns the type of change
2014-03-24 00:59:11	@Espyo	new user, user blocked, etc.
2014-03-24 00:59:14	@Espyo	but there are a LOT of types
2014-03-24 00:59:21	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-24 00:59:35	@Espyo	those, new page, new translation submission, log deletion, ...
2014-03-24 00:59:49	@Espyo	if I were to add a case to parse every one of them in particular, that'd take ages
2014-03-24 00:59:52	@Espyo	plus testing them
2014-03-24 00:59:56	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-24 01:00:03	@Espyo	even still, I should probably open an exception for user creation, though, huh

2014-03-24 16:57:42	@PikFan	.
2014-03-24 16:57:53	@PikFan	so I got Unending Glow last night
2014-03-24 16:58:53	@PikFan	Prisms cost 62 quint
2014-03-24 16:59:25	@PikFan	I need less than 25 quint for 50K HCs
2014-03-24 16:59:25	Testyo	50 K = -223.15 °C / -369.67 °F
2014-03-24 17:01:15	@Espyo	hey
2014-03-24 17:01:16	@Espyo	wow
2014-03-24 17:06:00	@Espyo	ok, so aggressiveness in the engine works by "teams"
2014-03-24 17:06:12	@Espyo	like, we have four teams, the enemy team, and no team
2014-03-24 17:06:24	@Espyo	mobs in team 1 can attack those in a different team
2014-03-24 17:06:28	@Espyo	enemies can attack mobs from all teams
2014-03-24 17:06:33	@Espyo	all teams can attack mobs
2014-03-24 17:06:42	@Espyo	but mobs in a team cannot attack their teammates
2014-03-24 17:06:46	@PikFan	what's the difference between a mob and a team again
2014-03-24 17:06:48	@Espyo	except mobs in "no team"
2014-03-24 17:06:50	@Espyo	heh
2014-03-24 17:06:53	@Espyo	mob = mobile object
2014-03-24 17:06:56	@Espyo	team = team
2014-03-24 17:07:10	@Espyo	mobile object = anything that is a thing, really
2014-03-24 17:07:20	@PikFan	so "mob" could be a Pikmin, enemy, etc?
2014-03-24 17:07:23	@Espyo	could be a Pikmin, a leader, an enemy, a gate, a geyser, etc.
2014-03-24 17:07:32	@PikFan	ok
2014-03-24 17:07:45	@Espyo	like, rocks spit from Armored ...
2014-03-24 17:07:47	@Espyo	uh
2014-03-24 17:07:52	@Espyo	Armored...
2014-03-24 17:07:54	@PikFan	...but how could there be mobs in no team
2014-03-24 17:07:55	@Espyo	Cannon Beetle Larva
2014-03-24 17:07:55	@Espyo	those
2014-03-24 17:08:00	@Espyo	hang on
2014-03-24 17:08:09	@Espyo	the rocks spit from ACBL are "no team"
2014-03-24 17:08:13	@Espyo	in that they can attack anything
2014-03-24 17:08:20	@Espyo	players, enemies, even other rocks
2014-03-24 17:08:23	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-24 17:08:24	@Espyo	they just attack /everything/
2014-03-24 17:08:28	@PikFan	right
2014-03-24 17:08:37	@Espyo	Pikmin however, belong to the "player 1" team, and can't attack other Pikmin belonging to the same team
2014-03-24 17:08:47	@PikFan	right
2014-03-24 17:08:52	@Espyo	but they can attack Pikmin in "player 2"'s team, think 2-P Battle mode
2014-03-24 17:08:58	@Espyo	now, here's the thing
2014-03-24 17:08:59	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-24 17:09:06	@Espyo	what about mobs that /never/ attack
2014-03-24 17:09:12	@Espyo	and shouldn't be attacked
2014-03-24 17:09:16	@Espyo	like plants
2014-03-24 17:09:23	@PikFan	but plants aren't mobile
2014-03-24 17:09:29	@Espyo	still counts
2014-03-24 17:09:34	@Espyo	it's a bit of a misnomer, gotta agree
2014-03-24 17:09:43	@Espyo	but it's still a mob as far as the engine cares
2014-03-24 17:09:44	@PikFan	heh
2014-03-24 17:09:48	@Espyo	what... should I name the "team" in which plants belong?
2014-03-24 17:09:57	@Espyo	not just plants, of course, but all things that don't attack and don't get attacked
2014-03-24 17:09:58	@PikFan	Flora? idk
2014-03-24 17:10:03	@Espyo	I chose the name "decoration", but it's kinda meh
2014-03-24 17:10:04	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-24 17:10:13	@Espyo	oh, the ship is one of those
2014-03-24 17:10:16	@Espyo	and onions
2014-03-24 17:10:18	@PikFan	scenery
2014-03-24 17:10:20	@Espyo	but they aren't plants
2014-03-24 17:10:24	@Espyo	nor decoration
2014-03-24 17:10:27	@Espyo	hm, I like scenery better
2014-03-24 17:10:32	@PikFan	(Onions technically are)
2014-03-24 17:10:37	@Espyo	but onions and the ship are still not quite scenery
2014-03-24 17:10:40	@Espyo	(maybe yes)
2014-03-24 17:10:55	@Espyo	nectar too
2014-03-24 17:11:02	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2014-03-24 17:11:08	@Espyo	I was originally going to go with "pacifist", but that's still stupid
2014-03-24 17:11:30	@Espyo	plus "pacifist" is what you'd call the likes of an IFB
2014-03-24 17:11:45	@Espyo	decoration, scenery...
2014-03-24 17:11:50	@Espyo	outsider
2014-03-24 17:11:57	@Espyo	uh, I'll check a thesaurus, I guess
2014-03-24 17:12:03	@Espyo	btw, where are you right now? school?
2014-03-24 17:12:10	@Espyo	you're coming here a lot more often, specially at this time
2014-03-24 17:12:12	@Espyo	spring break?

2014-03-24 17:12:41	@Espyo	right
2014-03-24 17:12:43	@PikFan	one
2014-03-24 17:12:48	@Espyo	oh, same as here then
2014-03-24 17:12:53	@Espyo	well, when I had classes, of course
2014-03-24 17:12:58	@PikFan	(not for the whole week, just for the afternoon)
2014-03-24 17:13:02	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-24 17:13:22	@PikFan	hmm

2014-03-24 20:56:53	@Espyo	and if we're not careful, the choice of a pointless name will evolve into a debate over flora life being sentient or not

2014-03-25 20:34:43	@Espyo	they're all pixelated

2014-03-26 01:28:33	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-26 01:28:38	@Espyo	hm, I'll change it a bit
2014-03-26 01:29:26	@PikFan	and I looked through the P3 guide, and saw we're missing quite a few obstacles
2014-03-26 01:29:29	@PikFan	let's see
2014-03-26 01:29:50	@PikFan	Elevator Platforms, Flukeweeds, Large Crystals
2014-03-26 01:29:52	@Espyo	I figured

2014-03-26 01:30:02	@Espyo	I read... ugh, wikia, and we were missing a few
2014-03-26 01:30:11	@Espyo	and a note: do /not/ visit the obstacle page at wikia

2014-03-26 01:31:44	@PikFan	I agree

2014-03-26 01:31:55	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-26 01:31:59	@PikFan	what color should it be?
2014-03-26 01:32:01	@PikFan	also brb
2014-03-26 01:32:17	@Espyo	maybe some reddish color

2014-03-26 01:52:01	TPM	I'm getting it
2014-03-26 01:52:01	@PikFan	great
2014-03-26 01:52:02	@Espyo	which is ridiculously high

2014-03-26 01:52:26	@Espyo	I have like 36GB of Dropbox space right now for free

2014-03-26 01:52:29	@PikFan	so it also acts as an image upload site?
2014-03-26 01:52:30	@Espyo	and I'm only really using 2GB
2014-03-26 01:52:31	TPM	I hate that chatroom help link
2014-03-26 01:52:34	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-26 01:52:40	@PikFan	great
2014-03-26 01:52:43	@Espyo	don't trust it to upload images that a load of people will see, though
2014-03-26 01:52:56	@Espyo	because even though it's convenient and all, there's a thing about multiple people going to a file at once
2014-03-26 01:52:58	@PikFan	right
2014-03-26 01:53:13	@Espyo	don't know the numbers, but if it's just for sharing on IRC, where at most, 10 people will open at once, it's fine
2014-03-26 01:53:17	@PikFan	I can't exactly see it as an image repository
2014-03-26 01:53:31	@Espyo	it might start blocking after like 50+ people trying to access a public file in a single minute

2014-03-26 01:53:50	@Espyo	the way it works is that it's a folder on your PC
2014-03-26 01:53:53	@PikFan	...oh, hello, telephone symbol
2014-03-26 01:54:04	@Espyo	whatever you drag in there also gets instantly uploaded into your Dropbox account
2014-03-26 01:54:21	@Espyo	and you have a special "Public" folder where you can also right-click files to get a link to the online version, which others can see
2014-03-26 01:54:32	@PikFan	so what you're saying is that what you upload to Dropbox gets downloaded into your computer?
2014-03-26 01:54:37	@Espyo	so whenever I have a pic, I put it on the public folder, right click, copy link, and paste here
2014-03-26 01:54:38	@Espyo	that's all
2014-03-26 01:54:47	@Espyo	more like the other way around, but that too
2014-03-26 01:54:50	@Espyo	think of it this way:
2014-03-26 01:54:56	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-26 01:55:00	@Espyo	your Dropbox repository and your folder in your computer are one and the same
2014-03-26 01:55:22	@Espyo	if you delete a file on your computer's Dropbox folder, your online Dropbox repository also loses that file
2014-03-26 01:55:40	@Espyo	if you go from their website and rename a file on your online repository, the file will be renamed on your computer's folder
2014-03-26 01:56:01	@PikFan	so what happens if I upload an image to Dropbox from the Wii U
2014-03-26 01:56:11	@Espyo	you can do that
2014-03-26 01:56:18	TPM	Sweet!
2014-03-26 01:56:24	@Espyo	though the point of convenient image sharing is dragging a file from your PC onto the public folder
2014-03-26 01:56:35	@Espyo	going online to upload a pic on Dropbox is not as convenient
2014-03-26 01:56:43	@Espyo	and also not much different from uploading on imgur or what have you
2014-03-26 01:56:48	@PikFan	then it would be Wii U → Dropbox → PC?
2014-03-26 01:56:48	@Espyo	I have the likes of Testyo's source code on Dropbox
2014-03-26 01:57:00	TPM	Testyo
2014-03-26 01:57:02	TPM	Source code...
2014-03-26 01:57:04	TPM	Nvm
2014-03-26 01:57:04	@Espyo	every change I make to him gets saved instantly on my Dropbox repository
2014-03-26 01:57:13	@Espyo	so if one day I lose my laptop, Testyo is still safe
2014-03-26 01:57:21	TPM	I will get Testyo
2014-03-26 01:57:21	TPM	Jk
2014-03-26 01:57:27	@Espyo	well, from the Wii U, you'd upload it on the Dropbox site
2014-03-26 01:57:35	@Espyo	and once the upload is done, you'd be able to share it like I do
2014-03-26 01:57:39	@PikFan	right
2014-03-26 01:57:44	@Espyo	and because you changed the online repository, your computer's folder also changes
2014-03-26 01:57:48	TPM	Wouldn't you, like  use the internet to get there
2014-03-26 01:58:03	TPM	The Wii u's online web thing
2014-03-26 01:58:03	@Espyo	so when you're done uploading, you turn around and you'll see a popup on your computer, saying a new file's been added
2014-03-26 01:58:09	@Espyo	TPM: yes
2014-03-26 01:58:12	TPM	Ok
2014-03-26 01:59:43	@PikFan	so what if I couldn't access my computer and wanted to use Dropbox on the Wii U?
2014-03-26 02:00:45	@PikFan	...do I really have to put in my first name and last name
2014-03-26 02:01:05	@Espyo	you could always lie
2014-03-26 02:01:16	@Espyo	you can use Dropbox on your Wii U alone, yes
2014-03-26 02:01:23	TZB	Going to sleep?
2014-03-26 02:01:27	@PikFan	I see
2014-03-26 02:01:34	@Espyo	not just yet, gotta change these
2014-03-26 02:01:44	TZB	What change?
2014-03-26 02:01:45	@PikFan	well it's not like people are going to stalk me on Dropbox, so I may as well use my name
2014-03-26 02:02:10	TPM	I will stalk you on dropbox
2014-03-26 02:02:28	@Espyo	your name doesn't appear anywhere anyway
2014-03-26 02:02:38	@Espyo	I don't think it even appears when you login on the Dropbox website
2014-03-26 02:02:46	@Espyo	but it sure doesn't appear publicly

2014-03-26 02:09:43	@Espyo	of course, by bank account, I mean literally anything
2014-03-26 02:09:46	@Espyo	so what's the problem?
2014-03-26 02:09:53	@Espyo	you only share what you want with who you want
2014-03-26 02:10:01	@Espyo	even "public" images aren't accessible by everyone
2014-03-26 02:10:10	@Espyo	if you don't share the link to your image, nobody will be able to find it
2014-03-26 02:10:23	@PikFan	just privacy issues

2014-03-26 22:36:26	@Espyo	err, ok
2014-03-26 22:43:20	@J	anyway, I'm gone now
2014-03-26 22:43:21	@J	bye
2014-03-26 22:44:56	@PikFan	back
2014-03-26 22:45:01	@PikFan	oh, bye J
2014-03-26 22:45:12	@PikFan	so what's wrong with the background?
2014-03-26 22:46:10	@Espyo	bye
2014-03-26 22:46:26	@Espyo	we tried, and J thought it was a bit contrasting
2014-03-26 22:46:37	@Espyo	the main article part is in white, and the background is black
2014-03-26 22:46:44	@Espyo	you use Firefox?
2014-03-26 22:46:49	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-26 22:47:01	@Espyo	open any wiki page
2014-03-26 22:47:25	@Espyo	right click the white space above the "page", "discussion", etc. tabs, and click inspect element
2014-03-26 22:48:04	@Espyo	that'll open a window with stuff
2014-03-26 22:48:12	@PikFan	mhm...
2014-03-26 22:48:23	@Espyo	on the left part, go to the whole top, and click on <body class= bla bla bla
2014-03-26 22:48:28	@Espyo	it should be the second line
2014-03-26 22:48:36	@Espyo	*fourth line
2014-03-26 22:49:02	@PikFan	okay
2014-03-26 22:49:13	@Espyo	then, on the right side
2014-03-26 22:49:37	@Espyo	click on background: url(bla bla bla
2014-03-26 22:49:54	@Espyo	don't click on the blue part, though, only on the orange part of that line
2014-03-26 22:50:02	@Espyo	finally, it should change to a box you can edit
2014-03-26 22:50:33	@Espyo	remove everything and write: "url('http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/4/49/Background-03-2014.png') repeat fixed"
2014-03-26 22:50:36	@Espyo	and that should be enough
2014-03-26 22:50:41	@Espyo	and you'll be able to see what we see
2014-03-26 22:51:28	@PikFan	hmmm
2014-03-26 22:51:42	@PikFan	what should it look like?
2014-03-26 22:51:49	@PikFan	the foreground is solid white
2014-03-26 22:51:50	@Espyo	like the new background
2014-03-26 22:51:56	@Espyo	solid?
2014-03-26 22:52:02	@PikFan	and the background is the "new wiki" background
2014-03-26 22:52:05	@Espyo	it should be faint solid
2014-03-26 22:52:12	@Espyo	err, *faint white
2014-03-26 22:52:19	@Espyo	you should be able to see a bit through the white
2014-03-26 22:52:27	@PikFan	can't see through it
2014-03-26 22:53:22	@Espyo	could you see the Pikmin in the old foreground?
2014-03-26 22:53:41	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-26 22:54:10	@Espyo	how weird then
2014-03-26 22:54:15	@Espyo	what version of Firefox?
2014-03-26 22:54:27	@Espyo	...though I guess it would have to be recent enough, in order to support right-click+inspect element
2014-03-26 22:55:07	@PikFan	ok, I refreshed, and the foreground is transparent; I can see the background
2014-03-26 22:56:00	@Espyo	ah, good
2014-03-26 22:56:06	@Espyo	dunno what that was all about then
2014-03-26 22:56:19	@PikFan	did what you told me to do again
2014-03-26 22:56:23	@PikFan	same result
2014-03-26 22:56:28	@Espyo	...oh
2014-03-26 22:56:36	@Espyo	I don't understand why, then
2014-03-26 22:56:44	@Espyo	right click on a zone in the foreground where there is no text
2014-03-26 22:56:47	@Espyo	inspect element
2014-03-26 22:56:50	@PikFan	the background changes, and the foreground becomes opaque
2014-03-26 22:57:08	@PikFan	ok
2014-03-26 22:57:18	@Espyo	scroll to the top, and instead of the 4th line, check the 6th
2014-03-26 22:57:21	@Espyo	*click
2014-03-26 22:57:32	@Espyo	*7th
2014-03-26 22:57:39	@Espyo	which should be <div id="content" bla bla
2014-03-26 22:57:59	@Espyo	and then on the right side, click on the orange text of the "background" property again
2014-03-26 22:58:07	@Espyo	but don't replace anything, just copy and paste it here so I can see what it says
2014-03-26 22:58:48	@PikFan	there's a problem
2014-03-26 22:58:54	@PikFan	there's no background
2014-03-26 22:59:09	@Espyo	...
2014-03-26 22:59:11	@PikFan	*"background"
2014-03-26 22:59:28	@Espyo	on the right side, you have "div#content" in blue, right?
2014-03-26 23:00:10	@Espyo	if so, click on any other orange property
2014-03-26 23:00:12	@Espyo	and press enter
2014-03-26 23:00:20	@Espyo	then you can type "background:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)"
2014-03-26 23:01:12	@PikFan	but there aren't any other orange properties
2014-03-26 23:01:49	@Espyo	:|
2014-03-26 23:01:59	@Espyo	well, click on the blue "div#content"
2014-03-26 23:02:08	@Espyo	and it should allow you to type a new orange property anyway
2014-03-26 23:02:33	@PikFan	"background:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)", right?
2014-03-26 23:03:00	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-26 23:03:51	@PikFan	now what
2014-03-26 23:04:27	@Espyo	well, it should be transparent white
2014-03-26 23:04:42	@PikFan	it isn't
2014-03-26 23:04:59	@Espyo	blah

2014-03-27 19:34:35	@PikFan	that's what the electrode is
2014-03-27 19:35:29	@PikFan	you could just make an icon of an incomplete circuit, with electricity flowing through the incomplete part
2014-03-27 19:37:03	@Espyo	hm
2014-03-27 19:38:13	@Espyo	the Iron Ball, does it always come in a weight-20?
2014-03-27 19:38:21	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-27 19:39:19	@Espyo	great
2014-03-27 19:39:33	@Espyo	what exactly is the river dam?
2014-03-27 19:39:39	@Espyo	just a bridge with 3 Flukeweeds?
2014-03-27 19:39:42	@Espyo	*just a stick
2014-03-27 19:39:42	@PikFan	it's just Dam
2014-03-27 19:39:56	@PikFan	yeah, blocking the flow of Lily Pads
2014-03-27 19:40:00	@Espyo	ok
2014-03-27 19:40:17	@PikFan	(wiki wouldn't let me upload it as Dam.jpg)
2014-03-27 19:40:28	@Espyo	already used?
2014-03-27 19:40:30	@Espyo	or swear?
2014-03-27 19:40:47	@PikFan	can't exactly remember
2014-03-27 19:40:54	@PikFan	just some error

2014-03-27 19:42:36	@Espyo	small crystals, what are ALL the differences between them and the large crystals?
2014-03-27 19:43:13	@PikFan	small crystals block geysers, or hold small items
2014-03-27 19:43:43	@PikFan	large crystals block passageways, and hold several small items or a big item
2014-03-27 19:44:45	@Espyo	how many hits to break a small crystal? one or more?
2014-03-27 19:45:05	@PikFan	to break a small crystal you have to throw 3 Rock Pikmin at it
2014-03-27 19:45:14	@PikFan	large crystal needs 10 Rocks
2014-03-27 19:46:44	@Espyo	does the game or guide differentiate between the two?
2014-03-27 19:46:52	@Espyo	like, call them different names
2014-03-27 19:47:21	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-27 19:47:30	@PikFan	small crystal is Small Crystal
2014-03-27 19:47:37	@PikFan	large crystal is Large Crystal
2014-03-27 19:48:06	@Espyo	ok, I'm sold then
2014-03-27 19:48:11	@PikFan	...oh, are you making descriptions of them?
2014-03-27 19:48:11	@Espyo	I'll do two icons
2014-03-27 19:48:16	@Espyo	no no
2014-03-27 19:48:22	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-27 19:48:27	@Espyo	I was thinking of having just one icon for "crystal" and call it a day
2014-03-27 19:48:34	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-27 19:48:47	@PikFan	you still have to make a separate icon for crystal nodule
2014-03-27 19:48:48	@Espyo	but they serve different purposes (mostly the large ones blocking game areas) and they're recognized as different things in-game, so it's best to make two icons
2014-03-27 19:48:53	@Espyo	yeah, that's done
2014-03-27 19:48:57	@PikFan	ah, good
2014-03-27 19:49:30	@Espyo	ok, same thing, but Spotcaps vs Kingcaps
2014-03-27 19:49:49	@PikFan	Spotcaps might release Data Files when destroyed
2014-03-27 19:49:58	@PikFan	Kingcaps don't release anything
2014-03-27 19:50:11	@PikFan	actually let me reword that, about the spotcaps
2014-03-27 19:50:22	@PikFan	some spotcaps release data files when destroyed
2014-03-27 19:50:39	@PikFan	Kingcaps have more health than Spotcaps

2014-03-27 19:53:56	@Espyo	apparently I had something I wanted to ask about Tin Boxes but I forgot
2014-03-27 19:54:02	@Espyo	or maybe I just didn't close the image
2014-03-27 19:54:10	@Espyo	hm, still, do they also always come in a 20-weight?
2014-03-27 19:54:14	@Espyo	*weight-20
2014-03-27 19:54:18	@PikFan	yeah, there's only one of them
2014-03-27 19:54:20	@PikFan	so
2014-03-27 19:54:26	@Espyo	ah, ok
2014-03-27 19:54:33	@PikFan	in story mode anyway
2014-03-27 19:54:48	@Espyo	in the rest, are there any other weights?
2014-03-27 19:54:54	@PikFan	there's another one in mission mode, let me check its weight
2014-03-27 19:54:59	@Espyo	please do
2014-03-27 19:55:04	@PikFan	it's probably 20, but...

2014-03-27 19:56:40	@PikFan	yep, 20
2014-03-27 19:57:21	@Espyo	ok, good
2014-03-27 19:57:29	@Espyo	finally, explain tunnels, please
2014-03-27 19:57:46	@PikFan	tunnels serve as shortcuts
2014-03-27 19:58:08	@PikFan	tunnels initially appear as a pile of rubble embedded in a wall
2014-03-27 19:58:26	@PikFan	if you charge your Pikmin at it, they'll start digging
2014-03-27 19:58:43	@PikFan	after a moment, they'll emerge at the other side, and the tunnel will be complete
2014-03-27 19:58:50	@PikFan	then you can go through
2014-03-27 19:59:19	@PikFan	do you want me to upload a picture of them digging through?
2014-03-27 20:00:38	@Espyo	it's fine
2014-03-27 20:00:47	@PikFan	okay
2014-03-27 20:00:48	@Espyo	I suppose the actual obstacle there is the rubble inside the tunnel, not the tunnel itself
2014-03-27 20:00:52	@Espyo	what does the game call it?
2014-03-27 20:00:56	@PikFan	Tunnel
2014-03-27 20:01:08	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-03-27 20:01:13	@Espyo	I'll get working on the rest of the icons then
2014-03-27 20:01:18	@Espyo	I was waiting for these answers to continue
2014-03-27 20:01:52	@PikFan	yeah, just make an icon of a rubble pile in a wall, or something
2014-03-27 20:02:37	@Espyo	not quite sure what to draw for the electrode
2014-03-27 20:02:41	@Espyo	there's not a lot of room
2014-03-27 20:02:52	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-27 20:02:58	@PikFan	just draw the electricity, then
2014-03-27 20:03:52	@PikFan	make sure to include those white thingies at the end of the electricity: http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/5/5b/Electrode.jpg
2014-03-27 20:04:27	@Espyo	but that's after the circuit is closed, right?
2014-03-27 20:04:34	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-27 20:05:44	@Espyo	maybe it'd make more sense with the circuit open
2014-03-27 20:05:51	@Espyo	when it's an actual obstacle
2014-03-27 20:05:54	@PikFan	hmm, maybe
2014-03-27 20:05:58	@Espyo	though I guess it's still an obstacle after being closed
2014-03-27 20:06:09	@PikFan	just completed
2014-03-27 20:06:22	@PikFan	and yeah, it'd be easier for players to identify
2014-03-27 20:06:29	@PikFan	...oh
2014-03-27 20:06:32	@PikFan	well, wait
2014-03-27 20:06:51	@PikFan	could you draw Yellow Pikmin in there?
2014-03-27 20:08:29	@PikFan	maybe you could draw two unconnected wires, with 2 Yellows in there, with a fraction above them saying 2/3
2014-03-27 20:09:07	@Espyo	I'd like to avoid drawing yellows
2014-03-27 20:09:17	@Espyo	every icon is an image of the thing
2014-03-27 20:09:22	@Espyo	this one would involve Pikmin and numbers
2014-03-27 20:09:26	@Espyo	plus there's not enough room
2014-03-27 20:09:28	@PikFan	I see
2014-03-27 20:09:38	@PikFan	then yeah, draw the electricity
2014-03-27 20:09:49	@Espyo	all right
2014-03-27 20:10:55	@Espyo	what do the iron balls say?
2014-03-27 20:11:01	@Espyo	"WEIGHT", "Weight", or something else?
2014-03-27 20:11:33	@PikFan	20 weight
2014-03-27 20:11:45	@PikFan	"weight" is all lowercase
2014-03-27 20:12:12	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-27 20:15:18	@Espyo	are the two wires that connect with the sparks red?

2014-03-27 20:35:20	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-27 20:35:23	@PikFan	hmmmm
2014-03-27 20:35:26	@Espyo	I wasn't comfortable with the idea anyway
2014-03-27 20:35:31	@Espyo	bleh, I'll find another lamp
2014-03-27 20:35:36	@PikFan	the lamp doesn't have different levels?

2014-03-27 20:36:22	@PikFan	:|
2014-03-27 20:36:25	@Espyo	maybe one fancy one in the living room or something
2014-03-27 20:36:32	@Espyo	it's really not a standard thing to have adjustable lamps here
2014-03-27 20:36:41	@Espyo	it's a bit finesse, but not really
2014-03-27 20:36:50	@PikFan	hm
2014-03-27 20:37:07	@PikFan	maybe you could try moving it
2014-03-27 20:37:35	@Espyo	I'll just ducttape this huge newspaper on it
2014-03-27 20:37:50	@PikFan	*shrug*

2014-03-27 21:43:47	@PikFan	ok, uploaded lily pads
2014-03-27 21:44:48	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-27 21:45:28	@Espyo	err, which one is the lily pad?
2014-03-27 21:45:28	@PikFan	all uploaded
2014-03-27 21:45:41	@Espyo	there's the fully solid green lily pad on the water
2014-03-27 21:45:45	@Espyo	and something a bit more reddish below it
2014-03-27 21:45:45	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/2/25/Lily_pad.jpg
2014-03-27 21:45:53	@PikFan	yeah, the green one
2014-03-27 21:45:57	@Espyo	what's the other thing then?
2014-03-27 21:45:59	@PikFan	just focus on that one
2014-03-27 21:46:04	@PikFan	well
2014-03-27 21:46:15	@Espyo	oh, it's a docking platform
2014-03-27 21:46:21	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-27 21:46:26	@Espyo	it's where Pikmin and leaders walk to get to the lily pads
2014-03-27 21:46:29	@Espyo	I remember seeing a clip once
2014-03-27 21:46:30	@PikFan	right
2014-03-27 21:46:33	@PikFan	they jump
2014-03-27 21:46:36	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-27 21:46:50	@PikFan	when a lily pad is near, a big arrow appears, so you can jump

2014-03-27 21:47:09	@Espyo	I've never seen such dark hay before in my life
2014-03-27 21:47:30	@Espyo	all hay I know of is yellow and bright
2014-03-27 21:47:38	@Espyo	anyway, what do you think of this? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/p3%20obstacles.png
2014-03-27 21:48:49	@PikFan	hey, I like those
2014-03-27 21:48:56	@PikFan	they look great
2014-03-27 21:49:28	@Espyo	can you tell what all of them are?
2014-03-27 21:49:33	@Espyo	don't check your list
2014-03-27 21:49:35	@Espyo	they're not even sorted
2014-03-27 21:49:44	@Espyo	I don't want any bias, I want to know if you can tell right away
2014-03-27 21:49:48	@Espyo	if not, I might have to tweak something
2014-03-27 21:49:50	@PikFan	yeah, I can make them out
2014-03-27 21:49:56	@Espyo	you sure?
2014-03-27 21:50:04	@Espyo	no detail that seems odd or kind of hard to pick out?
2014-03-27 21:50:16	@PikFan	the sixth one is a crystal nodule, right?
2014-03-27 21:51:21	@PikFan	seems like some are missing
2014-03-27 21:51:41	@Espyo	crystal nodule, yeah
2014-03-27 21:51:42	@Espyo	"some"?
2014-03-27 21:51:47	@PikFan	oh duh
2014-03-27 21:51:52	@PikFan	hay and lily pads

2014-03-27 21:52:41	@J	I'm not sure I like the backgrounds
2014-03-27 21:52:56	@J	they make it harder to focus on/instantly see the object
2014-03-27 21:53:36	@J	I would go with plain white (/transparent) if you can, maybe add a dark border or something for pale objects

2014-03-27 22:01:26	@Espyo	I was trying to follow a layout like the hazard icons
2014-03-27 22:01:34	@Espyo	but I agree, I wasn't a fan of it since the first few
2014-03-27 22:11:27	@J	hmm, I haven't seen the hazard ones
2014-03-27 22:11:43	@J	I can see why you did it, since those first few look okay (fire, water, electricity)
2014-03-27 22:11:56	@J	again, I think the rest of those might be better without
2014-03-27 22:14:51	@Espyo	you mean the explosion, battle and sunset ones?

2014-03-27 22:24:10	@J	poison, boulders and abyss are the worst
2014-03-27 22:24:38	@J	explosions is probably a little too similar to sunset when you don't see them together
2014-03-27 22:24:52	@J	sunset would probably be better as a half-sun
2014-03-27 22:31:17	@Espyo	well, those icons, besides boulders and abyss, are what you see in the end of day death stats, in Pikmin 2
2014-03-27 22:31:24	@Espyo	right down to the back bubble's color
2014-03-27 22:32:20	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/p3%20obstacles%202.png thoughts?
2014-03-27 22:37:47	@J	still struggling to see some of them easily
2014-03-27 22:38:18	@J	first, the fact that it's a gradient makes it more of a thing than it needs to be, I think, which distracts from the foreground
2014-03-27 22:38:36	@J	second, some things have colours that just don't stand out against the grey
2014-03-27 22:38:46	@J	the box at (2, 2), for instance, I can hardly see the edges of
2014-03-27 22:39:04	@J	of course, take my colour-blindness into consideration
2014-03-27 22:39:26	@PikFan	wait
2014-03-27 22:39:31	@PikFan	J, you're color blind?
2014-03-27 22:40:14	@J	yeah
2014-03-27 22:40:36	@PikFan	in all the colors, or a specific type?
2014-03-27 22:41:29	@Espyo	did you just start by 0 in that
2014-03-27 22:41:36	@J	2012-12-06 21:22:05     <@J>    (and also I'm colour-blind)
2014-03-27 22:41:36	@J	2012-12-06 21:22:13     <@PikFan>       you are?
2014-03-27 22:41:36	@J	2012-12-06 21:22:23     <@PikFan>       I... did not know that
2014-03-27 22:41:40	@Espyo	there's no such thing as all-color blindness, PikFan
2014-03-27 22:41:45	@J	I knew I'd find it
2014-03-27 22:41:54	@J	Espyo: I think there is, actually
2014-03-27 22:41:59	@Espyo	whaa?
2014-03-27 22:42:00	@J	it's just very rare
2014-03-27 22:42:07	@Espyo	I thought that was a myth, later proven wrong
2014-03-27 22:42:10	@J	at the very least, it gets a lot more severe than what I have
2014-03-27 22:42:26	@PikFan	so what colors are you blind to?
2014-03-27 22:42:41	@J	it's more like I just see colours differently
2014-03-27 22:42:46	@PikFan	hmm, I vaguely remember that conversation
2014-03-27 22:42:57	@PikFan	I see
2014-03-27 22:43:01	@J	and some are hard to tell apart that 'normal' people can differentiate clearly
2014-03-27 22:43:18	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-27 22:43:44	@J	usually blue/purple, bright yellow/lime green and green/brown
2014-03-27 22:43:44	@Espyo	I'm really not a fan of the cardboard box, yeah
2014-03-27 22:43:49	@Espyo	and I have no idea how to fix it
2014-03-27 22:44:52	@J	get rid of the background, give the box a dark cartoony border
2014-03-27 22:44:57	@J	solves all problems
2014-03-27 22:44:57	@Espyo	as for the background being a gradient, I don't think it steals that much attention
2014-03-27 22:45:06	@Espyo	I can't just give random stuff a border
2014-03-27 22:45:14	@J	anyway, I can't tell what some of these are, but I don't know if that's because they're in Pikmin 3
2014-03-27 22:45:20	@Espyo	of course
2014-03-27 22:45:29	@Espyo	some of them are really hard to tell if you don't have the game
2014-03-27 22:45:41	@Espyo	like http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Bloominous_stemple.jpg
2014-03-27 22:46:03	@J	both of the far right icons seem to represent scales?
2014-03-27 22:46:21	@Espyo	they're close to one another on accident, but yeah
2014-03-27 22:46:33	@J	but yeah, of the ones I can tell, some minor niggles, but mostly okay
2014-03-27 22:46:41	@J	scales need more saturation, maybe
2014-03-27 22:46:55	@J	geyser water is too flat, needs some vertical lines or something

2014-03-27 22:48:12	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/p3%20obstacles%203.png snazzy
2014-03-27 22:48:20	@Espyo	tried a sunset style, it's not that bad
2014-03-27 22:48:23	@Espyo	of course we can't have that, but
2014-03-27 22:48:50	@J	makes some better, others worse (as expected)
2014-03-27 22:49:10	@J	the 2 at the far right of the middle row merge into the background now
2014-03-27 22:49:25	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-27 22:50:08	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/p3%20obstacles%204.png no background looks good actually
2014-03-27 22:50:15	@Espyo	except for the white gates, but that can be fixed easily
2014-03-27 22:50:40	@Espyo	...the arachnode web is gone
2014-03-27 22:50:41	@Espyo	haha
2014-03-27 22:51:24	@J	now just add some borders
2014-03-27 22:51:55	@J	I see no reason not to add a border to everything
2014-03-27 22:52:00	@J	at least to see what it looks like

2014-03-27 22:56:57	@J	hmm
2014-03-27 22:57:20	@J	it turned lines into black lines and gave shapes a border?

2014-03-27 22:57:49	@Espyo	obviously I'd have to add a border to everything by hand
2014-03-27 22:58:09	@Espyo	but yeah, that's what it did
2014-03-27 22:58:17	@Espyo	because I use border-only objects here and there
2014-03-27 22:58:29	@J	oh, I meant a transparent background behind the icons too
2014-03-27 22:58:40	@Espyo	drat, I forgo about that part
2014-03-27 22:58:43	@J	I guess I could open in an SVG editor...
2014-03-27 22:59:04	@Espyo	aren't you going to do so anyway already?

2014-03-27 23:01:22	@J	hmm, the backgrounds are in the same layer?
2014-03-27 23:01:28	@J	so I have to select them all individually?

2014-03-27 23:08:55	@J	hmm?
2014-03-27 23:08:55	@Espyo	 8th on the top line is missing the sparks
2014-03-27 23:09:04	@Espyo	and the 20 on the iron ball is misaligned
2014-03-27 23:09:26	@Espyo	but yeah, I like it quite a lot
2014-03-27 23:09:30	@Espyo	PikFan: your thoughts?
2014-03-27 23:10:46	@J	strange
2014-03-27 23:11:59	@J	how do I lower something in Inkscape?
2014-03-27 23:12:03	@J	put it behind something else
2014-03-27 23:12:07	@Espyo	page down
2014-03-27 23:12:13	@Espyo	end to put it at the bottom
2014-03-27 23:13:05	@J	hmm, seems the sparks get rendered if I increase resolution
2014-03-27 23:13:18	@J	the 20 is in the same place in Inkscape

2014-03-27 23:14:07	@Espyo	oh, I think I used a specific font
2014-03-27 23:14:25	@Espyo	...it says it's Trebuchet MS
2014-03-27 23:14:37	@Espyo	even though I'm pretty sure I chose Maridia or whatever it was
2014-03-27 23:14:55	@Espyo	Miriam
2014-03-27 23:15:47	@Espyo	anyway, I'll add an outline to all of them manually
2014-03-27 23:16:41	@Espyo	for some reason uniting the handle and the bag is glitchy
2014-03-27 23:16:48	@J	http://i.imgur.com/58Mxv5N.png
2014-03-27 23:16:55	@J	just made it really big
2014-03-27 23:17:19	@Espyo	how in the world did you manage to do that?
2014-03-27 23:17:25	@J	the plant thing is surrounded in a grey haze because of reasons
2014-03-27 23:17:27	@J	which part?
2014-03-27 23:17:34	@Espyo	the actual outlines
2014-03-27 23:17:39	@Espyo	copy-paste, all black, behind?
2014-03-27 23:17:54	@J	I told you
2014-03-27 23:18:14	@Espyo	flew past me
2014-03-27 23:18:18	@Espyo	it did went in

2014-03-27 23:18:29	@J	[22:52:24]*@J just select non-transparent parts, grow selection a bit, and fill behind the foreground
2014-03-27 23:18:44	@Espyo	but yeah, it's very effective
2014-03-27 23:18:50	@Espyo	I kinda ignored it because I had no plans of doing it
2014-03-27 23:18:58	@Espyo	my Inkscape is pretty slow now
2014-03-27 23:19:27	@J	you get 2 main issues: no borders within shapes, and a haze where outlines are fuzzy
2014-03-27 23:19:34	@J	the latter might be desired, not sure
2014-03-27 23:19:53	<--	Meisterbot (Meisterbot@fig-396bj638.dyn.optonline.net) has left #pikipedia
2014-03-27 23:20:04	@Espyo	hmm
2014-03-27 23:20:04	@J	Inkspace is slow because of too much stuff?
2014-03-27 23:20:11	@Espyo	mostly, yeah
2014-03-27 23:20:36	@J	your new laptop?
2014-03-27 23:20:57	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-27 23:21:01	@Espyo	not really that much better
2014-03-27 23:21:03	@Espyo	only game-wise
2014-03-27 23:21:49	@J	turns out holding paste in Inkscape makes craziness happen
2014-03-27 23:22:02	@Espyo	hehe
2014-03-27 23:22:15	@Espyo	I can't quite get the "grow selection a bit" part to work
2014-03-27 23:22:19	@Espyo	what exactly did you do?
2014-03-27 23:22:26	@J	I used GIMP, so
2014-03-27 23:22:35	@Espyo	hm
2014-03-27 23:22:37	@J	it's not going to be as easy
2014-03-27 23:22:39	@J	http://i.imgur.com/adrqKzj.png
2014-03-27 23:22:42	@J	now nothing is happy
2014-03-27 23:22:56	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure it pastes wherever it wants
2014-03-27 23:22:59	@Espyo	there's no rhyme or reason
2014-03-27 23:23:18	@J	no, it pastes under the cursor
2014-03-27 23:23:28	@J	but it happens so slowly that you have plenty of time to move the cursor around
2014-03-27 23:23:38	@Espyo	but if your cursor is out of the way
2014-03-27 23:23:43	@Espyo	it doesn't make sense where it pastes, then
2014-03-27 23:23:48	@Espyo	sometimes it pastes exactly in the same place
2014-03-27 23:23:51	@Espyo	other times slightly to the side
2014-03-27 23:23:54	@Espyo	other times quite a bit off
2014-03-27 23:23:57	@J	seems to be single-threaded, but it's running fairly smooth again now the pasting has stopped
2014-03-27 23:24:09	@J	until I move about 50 of those at once
2014-03-27 23:25:51	@J	okay, 'object properties' on lots of things at once isn't a good idea if the dialogue doesn't gain focus
2014-03-27 23:26:03	@J	...oh, wait
2014-03-27 23:26:07	@J	never mind, I'm just silly
2014-03-27 23:26:57	@J	oh, BTW, I also altered the bag and scales colours in that image I linked
2014-03-27 23:27:19	@Espyo	http://i.imgur.com/adrqKzj.png I can't tell

2014-03-27 23:28:59	@Espyo	can't really see much of a change
2014-03-27 23:29:02	@J	I meant the one from before
2014-03-27 23:29:07	@Espyo	http://i.imgur.com/58Mxv5N.png (this, of course)
2014-03-27 23:29:10	@J	yeah
2014-03-27 23:29:24	@J	...maybe
2014-03-27 23:29:39	@J	actually, maybe just the one before that
2014-03-27 23:29:53	@Espyo	well, it's gone in the history, now
2014-03-27 23:30:02	@Espyo	oh, http://i.imgur.com/4abENvg.png this?
2014-03-27 23:30:03	@J	http://i.imgur.com/4abENvg.png
2014-03-27 23:30:07	@J	yeah
2014-03-27 23:30:10	@Espyo	ah, it was in an open tab, actually
2014-03-27 23:30:48	@J	didn't spend time getting them perfect, but I thought they looked wrong, so I fiddled
2014-03-27 23:30:54	@Espyo	mhm
2014-03-27 23:31:01	@Espyo	what are those colors, so I can change them here?
2014-03-27 23:31:16	@Espyo	also, I'm better off rendering this here (font and all), sending you, you do your thing, and I'll crop them and save them individually
2014-03-27 23:31:30	@J	no idea
2014-03-27 23:31:40	@Espyo	color picker, then
2014-03-27 23:31:46	@J	I just did a raster-style thing, just changing the hue of the whole icon
2014-03-27 23:31:52	@J	rather than editing the SVG
2014-03-27 23:32:31	@J	there must be a program out there for cropping lots of images out of a big image
2014-03-27 23:32:47	@J	either by separating by background, or inputting a grid definition
2014-03-27 23:33:12	@J	actually, I guess a game engine with spritemap support could do the latter, if it has bitmap export
2014-03-27 23:33:46	@J	file:///home/j/Documents/Coding/projects/games/template/src/doc/_build/html/gfx-util.html#engine.gfx.util.Spritemap

2014-03-27 23:34:39	@J	hey look, I did have support for gaps between sprites
2014-03-27 23:35:07	@Espyo	hehe, nice
2014-03-27 23:35:19	@Espyo	but yeah, they're all 24x24, one every 50
2014-03-27 23:35:34	@Espyo	but do we all agree they look good with a border?
2014-03-27 23:36:06	@J	I think they do
2014-03-27 23:36:15	@J	still think the gates could do with one inside the posts, somehow
2014-03-27 23:37:28	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-03-27 23:38:30	@Espyo	agreed
2014-03-27 23:38:32	@J	could hack it by putting the posts in one layer and the main part in another, and doing the bordering procedure on both layers
2014-03-27 23:39:15	@Espyo	I could just shrink them
2014-03-27 23:39:23	@Espyo	and the border with give them their girth back
2014-03-27 23:39:41	@J	oh, that font - it does say you chose 'Miriam', and I don't have it
2014-03-27 23:39:51	@J	hmm, not sure that would work, but maybe I don't get what you mean
2014-03-27 23:41:25	@J	anyway, I have to go; we can finish this tomorrow
2014-03-27 23:41:43	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-03-27 23:41:57	@J	and it'll probably actually be worth writing the auto-separating program thing, because I'm 100% sure we'll end up having to do it at least twice
2014-03-27 23:42:07	@J	should only take a few minutes to write anyway
2014-03-27 23:42:30	@Espyo	twice? why?
2014-03-27 23:42:44	@J	because you know we'll want to go back and change something somewhere
2014-03-27 23:42:49	@J	that's how things work
2014-03-27 23:42:57	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-03-27 23:42:58	@Espyo	good point

2014-03-28 00:30:11	@PikFan	personally I like this one http://i.imgur.com/58Mxv5N.png
2014-03-28 00:30:30	@PikFan	borders aren't too thick nor too thin

2014-03-28 00:33:08	@PikFan	hmm, the kingcap/spotcaps are brown
2014-03-28 00:33:23	@PikFan	that is, their tops
2014-03-28 00:33:29	@PikFan	should be a bit redder imo
2014-03-28 00:34:24	@Espyo	yeah, it's the color the color picker picked
2014-03-28 00:34:43	@PikFan	can you manually change the color?
2014-03-28 00:35:34	@Espyo	right now? not really
2014-03-28 00:35:39	@Espyo	I mean, on this image J made, no

2014-03-28 00:36:03	@PikFan	heh, okay

2014-03-28 00:53:56	@PikFan	the red thingies are asymmetric

2014-03-28 00:56:49	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-03-28 00:57:05	@PikFan	I'm not sure I like bridges
2014-03-28 00:57:56	@PikFan	even though they don't look as though you're looking at them from underneath anymore, they still look weird
2014-03-28 00:58:41	@PikFan	maybe because the bridge itself has no depth?
2014-03-28 00:59:48	@Espyo	I have to revamp them
2014-03-28 00:59:49	@Espyo	they're too flat

2014-03-28 06:40:53	@PikFan	if it weren't for daylight saving it would be 6:03
2014-03-28 06:41:24	@PikFan	...and if it weren't for daylight saving the sun would rise at 4:29 on the summer solstice
2014-03-28 06:41:31	@PikFan	*4:29 am
2014-03-28 06:43:50	@Espyo	all right, CAT scan is clear

2014-03-28 07:49:34	Tydyesk8rguy	Hello
2014-03-28 07:49:40	@PikFan	hi
2014-03-28 07:50:00	@PikFan	so how do you like the wiki so far?
2014-03-28 07:50:03	Tydyesk8rguy	I am assuming we are all big Pikmin fans
2014-03-28 07:50:12	@PikFan	I am
2014-03-28 07:50:23	@PikFan	otherwise I wouldn't be here :P
2014-03-28 07:50:50	Tydyesk8rguy	I really like the wiki so far, but I really want more info and stuff for Pikmin 3
2014-03-28 07:51:01	@PikFan	of course
2014-03-28 07:51:08	@PikFan	that's our goal
2014-03-28 07:51:32	@PikFan	to become the most comprehensive site for Pikmin information there is
2014-03-28 07:51:47	Tydyesk8rguy	I'm not really great at editing but I help out whenever I see a mistake or something needs to be updated
2014-03-28 07:52:14	@PikFan	right
2014-03-28 07:52:30	@PikFan	and that's fine, you're a new user
2014-03-28 07:52:38	Tydyesk8rguy	Yeah
2014-03-28 07:53:31	Tydyesk8rguy	I hoping that Nintendo releases more DLC for Pikmin 3
2014-03-28 07:53:41	Tydyesk8rguy	*hope
2014-03-28 07:54:03	@PikFan	maybe
2014-03-28 07:54:22	@PikFan	can't exactly see 20 Mission Mode stages though
2014-03-28 07:54:33	Tydyesk8rguy	Yeah
2014-03-28 07:54:50	Tydyesk8rguy	But they levels they have ale ready are pretty good
2014-03-28 07:55:17	Tydyesk8rguy	And I still need platinum on two more stages
2014-03-28 07:55:54	@PikFan	I have platinum on all Collect treasure! stages, except for Beastly Caverns, in which I have gold
2014-03-28 07:56:03	Tydyesk8rguy	what happened to everybody else?
2014-03-28 07:56:13	@PikFan	"everybody else"?
2014-03-28 07:56:25	@PikFan	you mean the other users?
2014-03-28 07:56:25	Tydyesk8rguy	Miles
2014-03-28 07:56:31	Tydyesk8rguy	yeah
2014-03-28 07:56:38	@PikFan	sleeping, probably
2014-03-28 07:56:46	Tydyesk8rguy	Guess they have other stuff to do
2014-03-28 07:57:02	@PikFan	it's 12:56 am here, gotta go to sleep soon
2014-03-28 07:57:10	@PikFan	what time is it for you?
2014-03-28 07:57:21	Tydyesk8rguy	12:57
2014-03-28 07:57:32	@PikFan	am or pm?
2014-03-28 07:57:39	Tydyesk8rguy	Though my clock is probably fast
2014-03-28 07:57:46	Tydyesk8rguy	AM
2014-03-28 07:58:02	@PikFan	oh, you live in the same time zone as me
2014-03-28 07:58:10	Tydyesk8rguy	You live west coast?
2014-03-28 07:58:17	@PikFan	yes
2014-03-28 07:58:22	Tydyesk8rguy	Somewhere in California?
2014-03-28 07:58:27	@PikFan	nope
2014-03-28 07:58:30	@PikFan	Oregon
2014-03-28 07:58:36	Tydyesk8rguy	Same

2014-03-28 07:58:54	Tydyesk8rguy	Corvallis
2014-03-28 07:59:01	@PikFan	woah
2014-03-28 07:59:16	@PikFan	I live less than an hour from you, then
2014-03-28 07:59:19	@PikFan	Eugene
2014-03-28 07:59:24	Tydyesk8rguy	Eugene? 
2014-03-28 07:59:28	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-28 07:59:30	Miles_	I died
2014-03-28 07:59:32	Miles_	Sorry
2014-03-28 07:59:40	Tydyesk8rguy	Woah!
2014-03-28 07:59:47	Tydyesk8rguy	Nice resurrection 
2014-03-28 07:59:52	@PikFan	oh Miles, you need not apologize for things you don't have control over
2014-03-28 08:00:08	@PikFan	unless you willingly killed yourself
2014-03-28 08:00:19	Miles_	Um, well.....
2014-03-28 08:00:26	Tydyesk8rguy	That wouldn't be good...
2014-03-28 08:00:35	@PikFan	I was being sarcastic
2014-03-28 08:01:22	@PikFan	ah, I wish the sun would come back
2014-03-28 08:01:37	@PikFan	all we have is rain
2014-03-28 08:01:43	Tydyesk8rguy	When do you guys think the next Pikmin will come out?
2014-03-28 08:01:52	Tydyesk8rguy	Rain and allergies 
2014-03-28 08:01:59	@PikFan	yep
2014-03-28 08:02:17	@PikFan	I'm not sure if there even is going to be another Pikmin game
2014-03-28 08:02:18	Tydyesk8rguy	Hoping for 2017
2014-03-28 08:02:23	Tydyesk8rguy	Or sooner 
2014-03-28 08:02:39	@PikFan	mind you, Pikmin isn't exactly as popular as Mario
2014-03-28 08:02:48	Tydyesk8rguy	I know
2014-03-28 08:03:05	Tydyesk8rguy	Not everyone can be as popular as Mario
2014-03-28 08:03:29	@PikFan	except Shigeru Miyamoto :P
2014-03-28 08:03:38	Tydyesk8rguy	True
2014-03-28 08:04:07	Tydyesk8rguy	they last Mario game was really good but we still need Pikmin
2014-03-28 08:04:30	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-28 08:04:36	@PikFan	it'd be awesome
2014-03-28 08:04:44	@PikFan	what say you, Miles?
2014-03-28 08:04:56	Tydyesk8rguy	Not everything has to be Mario to be an awesome game
2014-03-28 08:05:13	@PikFan	no no no
2014-03-28 08:05:21	@PikFan	I said it'd be awesome
2014-03-28 08:05:31	@PikFan	in the sense of if they made another Pikmin game
2014-03-28 08:05:37	Tydyesk8rguy	Miles, is that your real name
2014-03-28 08:06:03	Tydyesk8rguy	I know it's awesome
2014-03-28 08:06:03	Miles_	Can they go ahead and let me delete patches please
2014-03-28 08:06:06	Miles_	No
2014-03-28 08:06:13	Tydyesk8rguy	Ok
2014-03-28 08:06:38	@PikFan	like the invisible wall around the blue onion
2014-03-28 08:06:48	@PikFan	or damage when you fall into the abyss
2014-03-28 08:08:23	Tydyesk8rguy	its too bad they're no Bulbmin in Pikmin 3
2014-03-28 08:08:28	Tydyesk8rguy	Or 1
2014-03-28 08:08:39	@PikFan	meh
2014-03-28 08:09:06	Tydyesk8rguy	Not that they're that great
2014-03-28 08:09:20	Tydyesk8rguy	But they are kinda cool
2014-03-28 08:09:34	@PikFan	I'm only complaining because there's no Purples to spam in Pikmin 3
2014-03-28 08:09:54	@PikFan	on the bright side it makes the game more challenging
2014-03-28 08:09:55	Tydyesk8rguy	Parasite Pikmin taking over the host
2014-03-28 08:10:16	@PikFan	(well, no Purples in story mode)
2014-03-28 08:10:31	Tydyesk8rguy	For some reason the purple Pikmins ground pound does not do damage to enimies
2014-03-28 08:10:50	Tydyesk8rguy	Enemies*
2014-03-28 08:11:11	@PikFan	that would be the developers reducing the Purple Pikmin's overpowered attack
2014-03-28 08:11:35	Tydyesk8rguy	Yeah but I want to kill stuff
2014-03-28 08:11:40	@PikFan	:P
2014-03-28 08:11:41	Tydyesk8rguy	Really fast
2014-03-28 08:11:45	@PikFan	go play some Pikmin 2, then
2014-03-28 08:12:12	@PikFan	call me crazy but I'm doing a no Purples run in Pikmin 2
2014-03-28 08:12:16	Tydyesk8rguy	I would but I don't own the game
2014-03-28 08:12:28	@PikFan	/whaaaat/
2014-03-28 08:12:31	Tydyesk8rguy	Isn't that impossible
2014-03-28 08:12:36	@PikFan	well
2014-03-28 08:12:42	@PikFan	no Purples other than needed
2014-03-28 08:12:46	Tydyesk8rguy	i can't find it at any stores
2014-03-28 08:12:47	@PikFan	*needed times
2014-03-28 08:12:52	Tydyesk8rguy	Oh
2014-03-28 08:13:00	Tydyesk8rguy	Or anywhere
2014-03-28 08:13:05	@PikFan	but a true no Purple run would be impossible
2014-03-28 08:13:13	@PikFan	hm
2014-03-28 08:13:32	Tydyesk8rguy	So I just keep renting it from the library 
2014-03-28 08:13:34	@PikFan	are you looking for the NPC! or GCN version?
2014-03-28 08:13:48	Tydyesk8rguy	Npc
2014-03-28 08:13:52	@PikFan	mm
2014-03-28 08:14:08	Tydyesk8rguy	Probably could get it online
2014-03-28 08:14:16	Tydyesk8rguy	Amazon or EBay
2014-03-28 08:14:45	@PikFan	maybe it's because Nintendo has less emphasis on the Wii these days
2014-03-28 08:14:47	@PikFan	idk
2014-03-28 08:15:06	Tydyesk8rguy	But renting it for free at the library for free is easier
2014-03-28 08:15:17	@PikFan	at least it's only $20
2014-03-28 08:15:23	Tydyesk8rguy	Yeah
2014-03-28 08:15:27	@PikFan	unlike $40
2014-03-28 08:15:32	Tydyesk8rguy	Nintendo Select
2014-03-28 08:15:36	@PikFan	mhm
2014-03-28 08:15:56	@PikFan	I have both versions of Pikmin 2
2014-03-28 08:16:06	Tydyesk8rguy	lucky
2014-03-28 08:16:07	@PikFan	owned the GameCube version way longer
2014-03-28 08:16:22	@PikFan	let's see... I'm on day 567
2014-03-28 08:16:23	Tydyesk8rguy	Because it came out first?
2014-03-28 08:16:35	@PikFan	yeah, partly
2014-03-28 08:16:38	Tydyesk8rguy	In game or real time
2014-03-28 08:16:44	@PikFan	in game
2014-03-28 08:16:48	Tydyesk8rguy	Ok
2014-03-28 08:17:09	@PikFan	100% the game a long time ago, so don't worry
2014-03-28 08:17:13	Tydyesk8rguy	I recently accomplished my biggest Pikmin accomplishment yet
2014-03-28 08:17:20	@PikFan	what's that?
2014-03-28 08:17:34	Tydyesk8rguy	Pikmin 3 collect all fruit
2014-03-28 08:17:40	@PikFan	oh, cool
2014-03-28 08:17:45	Tydyesk8rguy	In under 30 days
2014-03-28 08:17:49	@PikFan	nice
2014-03-28 08:17:51	Tydyesk8rguy	No deaths
2014-03-28 08:17:56	@PikFan	yay
2014-03-28 08:18:05	@PikFan	I collected all fruits in 15 days
2014-03-28 08:18:08	Tydyesk8rguy	Got 27 days
2014-03-28 08:18:40	Tydyesk8rguy	Took a bit longer with the no death thing
2014-03-28 08:18:54	@PikFan	when I first played through the game, I had no idea how to do Tropical Wilds, it was so confusing
2014-03-28 08:19:14	Tydyesk8rguy	I'll have to try a collect all fruit least amount of time though
2014-03-28 08:19:22	@PikFan	so I collected 50 something fruits
2014-03-28 08:19:36	Tydyesk8rguy	tropical wilds is my favorite area in Pikmin 3
2014-03-28 08:19:43	@PikFan	and I did that in... 21 days?
2014-03-28 08:19:53	@PikFan	then I revised my run
2014-03-28 08:20:01	Tydyesk8rguy	But there are so many little areas in Tropical Wilds
2014-03-28 08:20:02	@PikFan	collected all fruit in 18 days
2014-03-28 08:20:10	@PikFan	then revised it again to 15
2014-03-28 08:20:15	Tydyesk8rguy	Cool
2014-03-28 08:20:16	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-28 08:20:46	@PikFan	I could do it in 14 days, just haven't gotten around to doing it yet
2014-03-28 08:20:51	Miles_	I did it in 10 days!
2014-03-28 08:20:54	 *	Miles_ runs
2014-03-28 08:21:02	@PikFan	yes
2014-03-28 08:21:03	--	Miles_ is now known as Miles
2014-03-28 08:21:04	Tydyesk8rguy	10 day run!?!
2014-03-28 08:21:13	@PikFan	it's the minimum possible
2014-03-28 08:21:28	Tydyesk8rguy	As far as we know
2014-03-28 08:21:32	@PikFan	yep
2014-03-28 08:21:38	Tydyesk8rguy	Maybe there is a glitch
2014-03-28 08:21:47	@PikFan	people thought that Pikmin 2 could be done in only 8 days
2014-03-28 08:21:48	Miles	It'd have to be a pretty major glitch
2014-03-28 08:21:49	Tydyesk8rguy	That gives you 10000000 bomb rocks
2014-03-28 08:22:02	@PikFan	until Miles discovered how to access Blues early
2014-03-28 08:22:17	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-28 08:22:19	Tydyesk8rguy	And that would be cool
2014-03-28 08:22:26	Miles	Also yay, an advertising opportunity
2014-03-28 08:22:27	Miles	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEzLjIIkz7Q
2014-03-28 08:22:52	Tydyesk8rguy	Nobody wants to watch your cool video
2014-03-28 08:22:59	@PikFan	:(
2014-03-28 08:23:01	@PikFan	I do!
2014-03-28 08:23:12	Tydyesk8rguy	We'll I can't
2014-03-28 08:23:21	Tydyesk8rguy	Well*
2014-03-28 08:23:40	Tydyesk8rguy	Because I'm on an IPad right now
2014-03-28 08:23:45	@PikFan	maybe there's something that lets you teleport inside the blue onion's invisible wall
2014-03-28 08:23:47	Tydyesk8rguy	Instead of my computer
2014-03-28 08:23:53	@PikFan	I see
2014-03-28 08:23:58	Miles	That wouldn't lower the day count
2014-03-28 08:24:02	Tydyesk8rguy	Like walking through a wall
2014-03-28 08:24:10	Miles	You'd still need Wingeds to open it

2014-03-28 21:45:44	@Espyo	you've been here for seconds
2014-03-28 21:46:21	@Espyo	hm, the icons are meant to be 24x24, with the border included
2014-03-28 21:46:25	TZB	You been in Great Britain since the day you were born?
2014-03-28 21:46:32	@Espyo	so most of these will go over the limit when you add a border
2014-03-28 21:47:11	@J	...pretty much, I guess?
2014-03-28 21:47:36	@Espyo	shrink 'em then
2014-03-28 21:48:09	@J	probably makes most sense to render at a large size, then separate, then auto-scale to fit in 24x24
2014-03-28 21:48:57	@Espyo	uh, I like that idea better
2014-03-28 21:49:04	@Espyo	they're already rendered at 48x48, anyway
2014-03-28 21:49:33	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/All.png will this do for you?

2014-03-28 21:50:56	@J	they'll just end up narrower than they were meant to be
2014-03-28 21:51:08	@J	also, there's no harm rendering much larger, even
2014-03-28 21:51:34	@J	if you're doing raster graphics, work as large as you can before scaling down

2014-03-28 21:55:41	@Espyo	right
2014-03-28 21:56:03	@Espyo	the final goal is to have 48x48 bitmaps, that will be shown in 12x12 on our infoboxes
2014-03-28 21:58:52	@J	wait, what happened to 24x24?
2014-03-28 21:59:38	@Espyo	oops

2014-03-28 21:59:52	@Espyo	_x12 used to be the old size
2014-03-28 22:02:08	@J	why is the goal 48x48 then?

2014-03-28 22:06:34	@Espyo	if we ever need to show the icons outside of the infobox, it might be useful to have something more understandable
2014-03-28 22:07:59	@J	so do we want to crop them, or have them all the same size?
2014-03-28 22:08:13	@J	hmm, but MediaWiki's scaling can be pretty poor
2014-03-28 22:08:25	@J	see how it turns out, I guess
2014-03-28 22:08:40	@Espyo	mono-spaced should be the best

2014-03-28 22:12:17	@Espyo	still can't figure out why, but whatever
2014-03-28 22:13:45	@J	is your gap between rows meant to be 53px?

2014-03-28 22:14:26	@Espyo	both for columns and rows
2014-03-28 22:14:33	@Espyo	one icon starts every 50th pixel
2014-03-28 22:14:55	@J	at 48x48, I mean (the one you sent me)
2014-03-28 22:15:20	@J	the image is 250 high, and (250 - 3*48) / (3 - 1) == 53

2014-03-28 22:17:11	@Espyo	well, it's fixed now

2014-03-28 23:09:38	@J	square, scaled to 48x48
2014-03-28 23:09:47	@Espyo	look at the bramble gates vs poison bramble gates
2014-03-28 23:09:50	@Espyo	they don't align
2014-03-28 23:10:07	@J	fair enough
2014-03-28 23:10:19	@J	how are you viewing them next to each other easily?
2014-03-28 23:10:52	@Espyo	windows photo viewer
2014-03-28 23:10:55	@Espyo	NOT the windows 8 app
2014-03-28 23:11:19	@J	also, if you want me to generate the right filenames while I'm doing this, you can send a list of ordered names
2014-03-28 23:11:37	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-03-28 23:11:43	@J	2 windows, you mean, or you can view them side by side?
2014-03-28 23:11:57	@J	actually, I guess it's obvious-ish if you switch between them
2014-03-28 23:12:01	@Espyo	I can press left or right to view the next or previous
2014-03-28 23:13:29	@PikFan	ok, that took longer than expected
2014-03-28 23:13:41	@PikFan	uploaded paper bag, front and back

2014-03-28 23:19:26	@Espyo	PikFan: what about electric gates
2014-03-28 23:19:59	@PikFan	...oh, you wanted me to upload electric gates, too?
2014-03-28 23:20:07	@Espyo	you say they're different, rights?
2014-03-28 23:20:11	@Espyo	-s
2014-03-28 23:20:24	@PikFan	different in looks, same purpose
2014-03-28 23:20:36	@Espyo	well, I want to see if I should make a different icon
2014-03-28 23:20:40	@PikFan	I guess I could
2014-03-28 23:21:19	@PikFan	all it really is is a fluorescent tube running between two tall boxes
2014-03-28 23:21:32	@PikFan	(not good at describing things)

2014-03-28 23:27:00	@Espyo	hmmmmm... they're quite different
2014-03-28 23:27:04	@Espyo	I think I'd rather do new icons
2014-03-28 23:27:44	@PikFan	wait, what
2014-03-28 23:27:53	@PikFan	by that you mean redoing the icons
2014-03-28 23:28:05	@Espyo	no no
2014-03-28 23:28:22	@Espyo	make a new icon for P3 paper bags and a new icon for P3 electric gates
2014-03-28 23:28:31	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-28 23:28:42	@PikFan	you'll still keep the old ones, right?
2014-03-28 23:28:55	@Espyo	of course
2014-03-28 23:28:57	@Espyo	for P2
2014-03-28 23:29:04	@Espyo	anything else that has a change in appearance in P3?

2014-03-28 23:29:17	@PikFan	seesaw blocks

2014-03-28 23:29:27	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-28 23:29:34	@PikFan	that's what they're called in P3
2014-03-28 23:29:44	@Espyo	but do they look the same?
2014-03-28 23:29:45	Tydyesk8rguy	Geysers?
2014-03-28 23:29:53	@PikFan	they have the same shape
2014-03-28 23:29:53	Tydyesk8rguy	No
2014-03-28 23:29:57	@PikFan	but look different

2014-03-28 23:30:09	@Espyo	not stone any more?
2014-03-28 23:30:15	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-28 23:30:18	Tydyesk8rguy	They're brown
2014-03-28 23:30:18	@PikFan	more... uh
2014-03-28 23:30:40	@PikFan	definitely a different material, that's for sure
2014-03-28 23:30:42	Tydyesk8rguy	Geysers look different
2014-03-28 23:30:53	@PikFan	a bit
2014-03-28 23:31:03	@Espyo	J: actually I forgot to tell you to add " icon" after the name
2014-03-28 23:31:08	@Espyo	I can do that now, there's a tool
2014-03-28 23:31:09	@PikFan	their bases are a bit bigger, but not as big as P2 geysers
2014-03-28 23:31:20	Tydyesk8rguy	Yeah
2014-03-28 23:31:21	@Espyo	(because of /course/ there's a tool, doing it from the command-line is impossible)
2014-03-28 23:31:36	@Espyo	maybe I can make the image a mix of the two
2014-03-28 23:31:40	@Espyo	take a screenshot, please
2014-03-28 23:31:55	@PikFan	wait, I'm confused
2014-03-28 23:31:58	@PikFan	a mix of what?
2014-03-28 23:32:05	@PikFan	geysers?
2014-03-28 23:32:48	@J	[23:26:47] @Espyo J: what did you change?
2014-03-28 23:32:53	@J	just named them, I guess?
2014-03-28 23:32:55	@J	can't remember
2014-03-28 23:33:02	@Espyo	yeah, that was a stupid question
2014-03-28 23:33:15	@Espyo	a mix between P2 and P3 scales, PikFan
2014-03-28 23:33:26	@Espyo	like they're gray in P2, if they're like green in P3
2014-03-28 23:33:32	@Espyo	I can make it a washed-out green
2014-03-28 23:33:33	@PikFan	eeh...
2014-03-28 23:33:39	@Espyo	one icon then suits both games
2014-03-28 23:33:45	@PikFan	they wouldn't look good
2014-03-28 23:33:53	@PikFan	because scales are waaay more detailed
2014-03-28 23:33:57	@PikFan	in P3, that is
2014-03-28 23:34:04	@Espyo	I think you're better off taking a screenshot anyway
2014-03-28 23:34:08	@Espyo	so I can judge better
2014-03-28 23:34:14	@Espyo	and even if I don't, we still need pictures
2014-03-28 23:34:14	@PikFan	right, of course

2014-03-29 19:19:27	@PikFan	so I left my computer on all night, wrinklers still sucking
2014-03-29 19:19:45	@PikFan	and I did a calculation, which said that each wrinkler should give about 6 quint
2014-03-29 19:19:51	@PikFan	let's see how many I get
2014-03-29 19:20:08	@PikFan	...wow

2014-03-29 19:20:32	@PikFan	8 of them gave 8.4 quint
2014-03-29 19:20:36	@Espyo	random guess
2014-03-29 19:20:41	@PikFan	now I have 203 quint in the bank
2014-03-29 19:20:43	@Espyo	you sure you don't mean hex?

2014-03-29 19:32:37	@PikFan	feel like I've seen that on wikia
2014-03-29 19:32:56	@Espyo	speaking of something belonging to wikia...
2014-03-29 19:33:04	@Espyo	why are your screenshots different sizes and naming styles?
2014-03-29 19:33:11	@PikFan	hmm, nope
2014-03-29 19:33:11	@Espyo	the most recent ones, from yesterday
2014-03-29 19:33:20	@PikFan	oh
2014-03-29 19:33:32	@PikFan	because I uploaded directly from the Wii U
2014-03-29 19:33:49	@Espyo	don't see how that'd change anything
2014-03-29 19:34:12	@PikFan	whereas with the other ones, I uploaded to Drive, dragged them into Paint, saved, then uploaded
2014-03-29 19:34:28	@Espyo	hm, ok, I guess
2014-03-29 19:34:48	@PikFan	the naming style is pretty much the same, except with "Pikmin 3" in the front
2014-03-29 19:35:46	@PikFan	I would never, never take images from wikia
2014-03-29 19:35:58	@PikFan	wikia's images are trash
2014-03-29 19:36:39	@PikFan	and besides I don't want to get into copyright trouble
2014-03-29 19:37:05	@Espyo	fair enough
2014-03-29 19:37:11	@Espyo	also, patrol those P3 edits
2014-03-29 19:37:15	@Espyo	and then we can move on to the icons
2014-03-29 19:37:47	@PikFan	done
2014-03-29 19:38:03	@PikFan	hmm, I notice that on obstacle pages, it's a thing to list locations
2014-03-29 19:38:28	@Espyo	is it
2014-03-29 19:38:29	@Espyo	*?

2014-03-29 19:44:59	@Espyo	the comments of the video /will/ contain at least one hundred "CRACKED BROUGHT ME HERE XD" comments

2014-03-29 19:45:54	@Espyo	on their defence, ours is incomplete...

2014-03-29 19:46:10	@Espyo	makes me scared he got that somewhere from wikia
2014-03-29 19:46:17	@Espyo	and the painfully brute /ignorance/ is spreading
2014-03-29 19:46:20	@PikFan	maybe the author is from wikia
2014-03-29 19:46:30	@Espyo	newcomers to the series will call them "Pikmins" because of this article
2014-03-29 19:46:35	@Espyo	I doubt it, but I can check...ish

2014-03-29 19:52:48	Nepeta	like
2014-03-29 19:52:50	@Espyo	I say this because one out of every 50 articles has a link to a video that's been deleted a few days after the article was written

2014-03-29 19:58:58	@PikFan	I just have bad experiences with downloading stuff

2014-03-29 20:07:56	@PikFan	"In Pikmin 3, the landmasses appear different than those in Pikmin 2. These new landmasses possibly represent Pangaea Ultima, a hypothetical supercontinent in the future. Each of the areas appear to be on a distinct region: the Tropical Wilds on Antarctica, the Garden of Hope on Australia, the Distant Tundra on Asia, the Twilight River on the Americas, and
2014-03-29 20:08:07	@Espyo	hm, not that great
2014-03-29 20:08:16	@PikFan	the <secret area> on India."
2014-03-29 20:08:16	Nepeta	isnt
2014-03-29 20:08:20	Nepeta	pangaea
2014-03-29 20:08:27	Nepeta	supposed to be from the past, not the future?
2014-03-29 20:08:32	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-29 20:08:36	@Espyo	but research says it'll happen again
2014-03-29 20:08:37	@PikFan	no no no
2014-03-29 20:08:39	Nepeta	oh
2014-03-29 20:08:41	@Espyo	the landmasses keep drifting
2014-03-29 20:08:46	@PikFan	Pangaea Ultima
2014-03-29 20:08:54	@PikFan	it's a new supercontinet
2014-03-29 20:09:00	Nepeta	oh ok
2014-03-29 20:09:07	Nepeta	i think that it being that far in the future is a bit
2014-03-29 20:09:10	@Espyo	"These new landmasses appear to represent Pangaea Ultima"
2014-03-29 20:09:12	Nepeta	crazy
2014-03-29 20:09:13	@Espyo	I'd like it better like that
2014-03-29 20:09:27	@PikFan	yeah, wasn't sure I agreed with my wording
2014-03-29 20:09:27	Nepeta	because wouldnt the treehouse in the snagret hole already have like decomposed?
2014-03-29 20:09:40	Tydyesk8rguy	Maybe
2014-03-29 20:09:48	@Espyo	yeah, somebody commented that on the comments of the Cracked article
2014-03-29 20:09:55	@Espyo	but in the end, Nintendo just did that for fun
2014-03-29 20:10:04	@PikFan	and they already mentioned this on wikia
2014-03-29 20:10:06	Tydyesk8rguy	it just a game 
2014-03-29 20:10:10	@Espyo	yep
2014-03-29 20:10:11	Tydyesk8rguy	After all
2014-03-29 20:10:22	@Espyo	remember to mention the unlikeliness as well, though, PikFan
2014-03-29 20:10:28	@PikFan	right
2014-03-29 20:11:18	Nepeta	if you are gonna have speculation
2014-03-29 20:11:22	Nepeta	include all sides of it
2014-03-29 20:11:25	@Espyo	yeah
2014-03-29 20:11:52	@PikFan	"Given that Pangaea Ultima appears 250 million years in the future, though, all relics of humankind should have long since perished."
2014-03-29 20:12:11	Tydyesk8rguy	But they haven't 
2014-03-29 20:12:19	Tydyesk8rguy	Not even the fruit
2014-03-29 20:12:24	Tydyesk8rguy	Or cookies
2014-03-29 20:12:41	@PikFan	...cookies?
2014-03-29 20:12:49	@PikFan	are you referring to Pikmin 2 treasures
2014-03-29 20:12:55	Tydyesk8rguy	Yes
2014-03-29 20:12:56	Nepeta	um
2014-03-29 20:12:57	Nepeta	fruit
2014-03-29 20:12:59	Nepeta	would still grow
2014-03-29 20:13:00	Nepeta	?
2014-03-29 20:13:04	Tydyesk8rguy	Yeah
2014-03-29 20:13:15	Tydyesk8rguy	But not the random ones in caves and such
2014-03-29 20:13:16	@Espyo	*most
2014-03-29 20:13:22	@PikFan	oh, I know
2014-03-29 20:13:31	@Espyo	on your edit, write "most", not "all"
2014-03-29 20:13:36	@Espyo	stuff like fruits could remain
2014-03-29 20:13:48	Tydyesk8rguy	Ok
2014-03-29 20:14:11	@PikFan	"Also, the fruits that appear should have evolved into new species."
2014-03-29 20:14:20	@Espyo	beh, too speculative
2014-03-29 20:14:27	Nepeta	not necessarily
2014-03-29 20:14:27	@PikFan	true
2014-03-29 20:14:29	@Espyo	evolution happens by natural selection
2014-03-29 20:14:53	@Espyo	if the environment doesn't require any changes, and hence, survival of the fittest, fruits could as well remain looking the same
2014-03-29 20:15:11	@PikFan	that in itself is speculative as well
2014-03-29 20:15:24	@PikFan	but yeah, I got rid of that
2014-03-29 20:15:41	@Espyo	yeah, but between the two, we're better off not saying anything regarding changed appearances
2014-03-29 20:17:16	@Espyo	PikFan: the obstacle icons, are they all ok?
2014-03-29 20:17:42	@PikFan	I never saw them; you never converted it to an image
2014-03-29 20:17:50	@Espyo	what?
2014-03-29 20:17:58	@Espyo	I thought you wanted me to convert the bunch into a zip file
2014-03-29 20:18:14	@PikFan	...why would you—ah, never mind
2014-03-29 20:18:35	@PikFan	I just wanted an image, not a zip file :P
2014-03-29 20:19:02	Nepeta	"In Pikmin 2's files, White Pikmin have a carrying speed number set to 3.0, Purple Pikmin to 0.6. However, this value isn't an actual speed multiplier, but maybe a speed adder."

2014-03-29 20:42:51	@Espyo	put it on the desktop as well
2014-03-29 20:43:27	@PikFan	now what?
2014-03-29 20:43:30	@PikFan	do I click it?
2014-03-29 20:44:34	@Espyo	double-click, yeah
2014-03-29 20:44:40	@Espyo	instructions should be straight-forward
2014-03-29 20:45:18	@PikFan	"The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?"
2014-03-29 20:45:26	@PikFan	there's a run button and a cancel button
2014-03-29 20:45:50	@Espyo	run
2014-03-29 20:45:58	@Espyo	windows and its petty attempts at being secure
2014-03-29 20:46:32	@PikFan	ok, guide me through the wizard; there's bound to be some extra stuff
2014-03-29 20:46:36	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Pellet by NepetaLast (+270 /* Pikmin 3 */) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pellet&curid=1078&diff=79139&oldid=78867
2014-03-29 20:46:41	Nepeta	why do you even need to download it though
2014-03-29 20:46:48	Nepeta	wont you see them after they are uploaded
2014-03-29 20:47:19	@PikFan	ok, I'm at Custom Setup
2014-03-29 20:47:32	@Espyo	Nepeta: I don't follow
2014-03-29 20:48:23	Nepeta	why does pikfan need to download them
2014-03-29 20:48:27	Nepeta	the images
2014-03-29 20:48:37	Nepeta	isnt that why he is getting 7-zip
2014-03-29 20:48:39	@Espyo	only to check them out before I get the greenlight to upload them
2014-03-29 20:48:47	Nepeta	oh
2014-03-29 20:48:52	@Espyo	he's the main Pikmin 3 guy here (for now, at least)
2014-03-29 20:49:02	@Espyo	so I want him to check if the P3 icons are looking good enough
2014-03-29 20:49:13	@Espyo	and if not, I have to go back and improve them
2014-03-29 20:49:38	@PikFan	actually never mind Espyo, I'm getting help from BetaMaster
2014-03-29 20:49:57	Nepeta	betamaster?
2014-03-29 20:50:06	Nepeta	wow he is everywhere
2014-03-29 20:50:18	@Espyo	ok
2014-03-29 20:51:52	@Espyo	PikFan: are there any buried fruits in P3?
2014-03-29 20:52:08	@PikFan	buried?
2014-03-29 20:52:14	@PikFan	as in, completely buried?
2014-03-29 20:52:17	@Espyo	yeah, like P2 treasures
2014-03-29 20:52:19	@Espyo	or even partially
2014-03-29 20:52:24	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-29 20:52:32	@PikFan	some fruits are partially buried
2014-03-29 20:52:41	@Espyo	do you need anything special to unearth them?
2014-03-29 20:52:43	@Espyo	like Whites in P2
2014-03-29 20:52:46	@PikFan	nope
2014-03-29 20:53:02	Nepeta	no
2014-03-29 20:53:02	@Espyo	not sure I should make [[File:Buried icon.png]] also work for buried fruit
2014-03-29 20:53:03	Testyo	"File:Buried_icon.png" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:Buried_icon.png
2014-03-29 20:53:07	Nepeta	whites arent in the main story
2014-03-29 20:53:09	@Espyo	not so much of an obstacle in P3
2014-03-29 20:53:11	@PikFan	though Yellows are better at digging than others
2014-03-29 20:53:12	Nepeta	so
2014-03-29 20:53:21	@Espyo	in P2 they kinda are, because you absolutely need Whites
2014-03-29 20:53:26	@Espyo	yeah, I know, I was comparing
2014-03-29 20:53:38	Nepeta	well they are an obstacle
2014-03-29 20:53:41	Nepeta	since they take more time
2014-03-29 20:53:57	@Espyo	still, it's a bit meh
2014-03-29 20:54:00	Nepeta	like
2014-03-29 20:54:14	Nepeta	the regular bramble gates
2014-03-29 20:54:18	@Espyo	the point is for us to warn about buried treasure on the infoboxes of areas, challenge mode (and mission mode) levels, and caves
2014-03-29 20:54:19	Nepeta	dont require any pikmin
2014-03-29 20:54:24	Nepeta	but are still an obstacle
2014-03-29 20:54:28	@Espyo	so the player can know what types of Pikmin to be prepared with
2014-03-29 20:54:30	Nepeta	*specific pikmin types
2014-03-29 20:54:31	@PikFan	in Mission Mode, there are some fruits completely buried
2014-03-29 20:54:38	@PikFan	but any Pikmin can unearth them
2014-03-29 20:54:42	@Espyo	right
2014-03-29 20:54:49	@Espyo	but gates actively imped your progress
2014-03-29 20:54:58	@Espyo	buried fruits have no real different compared to unearthed ones
2014-03-29 20:55:00	@PikFan	*impede
2014-03-29 20:55:02	@Espyo	only that it takes more time
2014-03-29 20:55:09	Nepeta	yeah but gates
2014-03-29 20:55:10	@Espyo	but there's no reason to warn the player about that on infoboxes
2014-03-29 20:55:17	@Espyo	*impede, yeah
2014-03-29 20:55:20	Nepeta	yeah i guess so
2014-03-29 20:55:22	@Espyo	imped is a word too apparently
2014-03-29 20:55:26	Nepeta	but
2014-03-29 20:55:34	@Espyo	yeah, it's mostly for warning the player/reader or not
2014-03-29 20:55:37	Nepeta	i guess you could warn them to bring more yellows?
2014-03-29 20:55:44	@Espyo	...I guess
2014-03-29 20:55:47	Nepeta	for a more timely unearthing
2014-03-29 20:55:55	@Espyo	well, it doesn't require me to change the icon
2014-03-29 20:55:59	@Espyo	and it IS for completion's sake
2014-03-29 20:56:05	@Espyo	and bringing more Yellows for that IS a good idea
2014-03-29 20:56:23	@Espyo	although you have no caves in P3, so you pretty much know you'll need a bit of everything everywhere you go
2014-03-29 20:56:28	@Espyo	but still, I guess I could as well
2014-03-29 20:57:35	Nepeta	there also arent any bramble gates
2014-03-29 20:57:35	Nepeta	so
2014-03-29 20:58:40	@Espyo	right
2014-03-29 20:58:49	@Espyo	PikFan: how's 7-zip going?
2014-03-29 20:59:06	@PikFan	still at Custom Setup
2014-03-29 20:59:19	@J	[20:32:28] @Espyo and unlike what J might think, the time it takes to make a bot to do it for me well exceeds the time
2014-03-29 20:59:19	@J	it takes me to do it by hand
2014-03-29 20:59:19	@PikFan	BetaMaster is taking forever to respond, heaven knows why
2014-03-29 20:59:22	@J	true
2014-03-29 20:59:40	@Espyo	ah, I've knocked some sense into him
2014-03-29 20:59:44	@J	but with the number of times we've had to do mass upload, we should probably have a tool that just does it
2014-03-29 20:59:53	@Espyo	yes, but here's the catch:
2014-03-29 20:59:55	@Espyo	you already have one
2014-03-29 20:59:56	@Espyo	:|
2014-03-29 21:00:11	@J	?
2014-03-29 21:00:18	@PikFan	was the face at me or J
2014-03-29 21:01:37	@Espyo	J
2014-03-29 21:01:54	@Espyo	you already have a tool that uploads en mass
2014-03-29 21:02:03	@Espyo	so I don't need to make one
2014-03-29 21:02:11	@J	you mean the thing where you have to do programming every time you want to use it/
2014-03-29 21:02:12	@J	*?
2014-03-29 21:03:13	@Espyo	do you?
2014-03-29 21:03:16	@J	yes
2014-03-29 21:03:18	@Espyo	well, you do, but minor
2014-03-29 21:03:47	@J	yes, but it's still work
2014-03-29 21:04:01	@Espyo	PikFan: should I slam Kingcaps and Spotcaps in the same item, in [[Obstacle]]?

2014-03-29 21:05:28	@Espyo	yup
2014-03-29 21:05:57	@Espyo	wha— /WHAT/
2014-03-29 21:06:27	@Espyo	I am legitimately confused right now
2014-03-29 21:06:46	@Espyo	ok, so I have a shortcut to a music file I wanted to hear
2014-03-29 21:06:51	@Espyo	I've heard this several times before
2014-03-29 21:06:57	@Espyo	today I open it
2014-03-29 21:07:09	@Espyo	it's asking me for my credentials so I can login to my old laptop via network
2014-03-29 21:07:21	@Espyo	and the shortcut properties certainly don't link to anything on the other laptop
2014-03-29 21:07:23	@Espyo	WHAT
2014-03-29 21:08:44	@Espyo	if I plop the link to the file in explorer, it opens the file instantly
2014-03-29 21:08:46	@Espyo	I...
2014-03-29 21:09:04	@Espyo	I'm speechless
2014-03-29 21:09:10	@Espyo	I'm still trying to wrap my head around this
2014-03-29 21:11:32	@PikFan	I'm STILL at custom setup, still no idea what to do, still frustrated
2014-03-29 21:11:52	@Espyo	...just press next a whole bunch of times
2014-03-29 21:11:58	@Espyo	it's just an installer, not a 7-headed monster
2014-03-29 21:12:05	@PikFan	yeah but
2014-03-29 21:12:17	@PikFan	it might install stuff I don't want
2014-03-29 21:12:24	@Espyo	 7-zip doesn't, though
2014-03-29 21:12:31	@Espyo	 7-zip is trustworthy
2014-03-29 21:12:36	@PikFan	still, I'm not trusting
2014-03-29 21:12:38	@Espyo	specially because you downloaded it from the official website
2014-03-29 21:12:50	@Espyo	 7-zip is one of the few I just click "next" over and over blindly
2014-03-29 21:12:52	@PikFan	...oh
2014-03-29 21:13:01	Sunscreen	pikfan i explained it to you
2014-03-29 21:13:03	@PikFan	I clicked next
2014-03-29 21:13:10	@PikFan	and then it said install
2014-03-29 21:13:15	@Espyo	all it does is asking you where to install to (default is the best place), if you want a shortcut to the file manager on the desktop, and that's it
2014-03-29 21:13:37	@Espyo	well, I removed the shortcut and placed it again, everything is fine
2014-03-29 21:13:39	@Espyo	what even
2014-03-29 21:13:39	@PikFan	ok wow, I made things way too complicated
2014-03-29 21:13:45	@Espyo	yep

2014-03-30 20:07:40	@Espyo	next to "edit" and whatnot
2014-03-30 20:07:51	Nepeta	not for me
2014-03-30 20:08:03	@Espyo	might be a patroller thing

2014-03-30 20:08:48	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-03-30 20:10:10	Nepeta	ok now to create the infobox for "defeat enemies"
2014-03-30 20:10:44	@Espyo	so what's that infobox for?
2014-03-30 20:10:50	Nepeta	for
2014-03-30 20:10:51	@Espyo	collect money?
2014-03-30 20:10:56	Nepeta	yeah
2014-03-30 20:10:57	@Espyo	or... whatever that mission mode type is called
2014-03-30 20:10:59	@Espyo	ok then
2014-03-30 20:11:07	Nepeta	"collect treasure"
2014-03-30 20:11:09	@Espyo	although...
2014-03-30 20:11:12	@Espyo	right, collect treasure
2014-03-30 20:11:17	@Espyo	we may be able to reuse that template for everything
2014-03-30 20:11:23	@Espyo	what things are different for defeat enemies?
2014-03-30 20:11:27	Nepeta	well
2014-03-30 20:11:33	Nepeta	you dont find random pikmin
2014-03-30 20:11:35	Nepeta	you grow them
2014-03-30 20:11:53	Nepeta	and there are candypop buds for whites and purples so
2014-03-30 20:12:17	Nepeta	really it wont be "how many of each type are there?" itll be "is this type avaliable?"
2014-03-30 20:12:27	@Espyo	right right
2014-03-30 20:12:33	Nepeta	but i suppose
2014-03-30 20:12:36	@Espyo	ok, I think it's better to use a new infobox, yeah
2014-03-30 20:12:38	Nepeta	they could use the same template?
2014-03-30 20:12:42	@Espyo	your call
2014-03-30 20:12:45	@Espyo	we can have optional fields
2014-03-30 20:12:48	Nepeta	because instead of numbers you just say yes or no
2014-03-30 20:13:01	@Espyo	right
2014-03-30 20:13:18	Nepeta	ok im not gonna make a new one

2014-03-30 20:49:26	@Espyo	which would result in:
2014-03-30 20:49:27	Nepeta	especially since there are two versions of each for collect treasure in addition to defeat enemies

2014-03-30 20:53:17	@PikFan	just realized a problem
2014-03-30 20:53:26	Nepeta	what
2014-03-30 20:53:38	@PikFan	since there are two infoboxes, there will be two Pikmin 3 game icons
2014-03-30 20:54:27	Nepeta	we can just turn off auto-icon
2014-03-30 20:54:43	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-30 20:55:10	Nepeta	like
2014-03-30 20:55:13	Nepeta	make it so that
2014-03-30 20:55:18	Nepeta	it doesnt automatically put the icon on the page
2014-03-30 20:55:28	Nepeta	and just put the icon on the page manually for each article
2014-03-30 20:56:32	@PikFan	oh, some Pikmin 3 news
2014-03-30 20:56:47	@PikFan	I went back and watched the E3 2012 trailer for Pikmin 3
2014-03-30 20:56:54	@PikFan	there are a lot of early things
2014-03-30 20:57:06	@PikFan	like
2014-03-30 20:57:15	@PikFan	Rock Pikmin make a different sound when thrown
2014-03-30 20:57:20	@PikFan	than they do now
2014-03-30 20:57:48	@PikFan	and
2014-03-30 20:58:37	@PikFan	when the pointer is on an enemy, it would glow blue, but when you point at it now, the enemy flashes blue
2014-03-30 20:58:46	Nepeta	oh yeah
2014-03-30 20:59:11	@PikFan	the mission mode interface was a little bit different, aesthetically
2014-03-30 20:59:19	Nepeta	ok guys ima make a test article for tropical forest
2014-03-30 20:59:31	@Espyo	J's already meant to re-work the game icons anyway
2014-03-30 20:59:35	@Espyo	so don't worry too much about that

2014-03-30 21:12:28	@PikFan	look more like insects than reptiles lol
2014-03-30 21:12:52	@J	oh, it's really just a case of adding a parameter to infoboxes to say 'don't show the game icons'; and on pages with multiple infoboxes, pass that to all of them and add the icons manually
2014-03-30 21:13:38	Nepeta	or just dont put the parameter on a single one

2014-03-30 21:15:34	Nepeta	why?
2014-03-30 21:15:59	@PikFan	because Collect Treasure Remix is also in CT

2014-03-30 21:16:47	@PikFan	true
2014-03-30 21:19:36	@Espyo	you should just let the templates create icons at will, wherever
2014-03-30 21:19:44	@Espyo	and then have the CSS grab all of the icons and make them invisible
2014-03-30 21:19:52	@Espyo	and create its OWN icon in the right place, and only one of it

2014-03-30 21:28:19	Nepeta	i dont think

2014-03-30 21:40:32	@J	[21:19:44] @Espyo and then have the CSS grab all of the icons and make them invisible
2014-03-30 21:40:32	@J	[21:19:52] @Espyo and create its OWN icon in the right place, and only one of it
2014-03-30 21:40:32	@J	[21:19:55] @Espyo *and then have the JS

2014-03-30 22:38:22	Nepeta	ok i have an idea
2014-03-30 22:38:23	Nepeta	what about
2014-03-30 22:38:28	Nepeta	for the picture of each mission mode stage
2014-03-30 22:38:35	@PikFan	I swear, when Alph says "Here it comes!", it sounds like he's saying "Emergency!"
2014-03-30 22:38:36	Nepeta	we have an image of its screen from the selection menu
2014-03-30 22:38:45	@PikFan	maybe, yeah
2014-03-30 22:38:53	@PikFan	put that in the gallery
2014-03-30 22:39:35	Nepeta	what gallery
2014-03-30 22:39:46	@PikFan	future gallery
2014-03-30 22:41:40	Nepeta	?? link?
2014-03-30 22:42:54	@PikFan	well I mean
2014-03-30 22:43:01	@PikFan	when we make a gallery
2014-03-30 22:43:10	Nepeta	oh
2014-03-30 22:43:13	@PikFan	because there's bound to be several images
2014-03-30 22:43:15	Nepeta	well i dont mean in a gallery
2014-03-30 22:43:17	Nepeta	i mean
2014-03-30 22:43:20	Nepeta	as the image in the infobox
2014-03-30 22:43:40	@PikFan	mmm
2014-03-30 22:44:02	@PikFan	IMO it would be better if we had a picture from the actual level
2014-03-30 22:44:06	Nepeta	yeah
2014-03-30 22:44:07	@PikFan	but that's me
2014-03-30 22:44:11	Nepeta	nah i agree
2014-03-30 22:44:16	Nepeta	maybe we can have both?
2014-03-30 22:44:25	Nepeta	sometimes on wikis i see people have two images in an infobox
2014-03-30 22:44:27	@PikFan	yeah
2014-03-30 22:44:28	Nepeta	one on top of the other
2014-03-30 22:44:33	@PikFan	hmm
2014-03-30 22:44:39	Nepeta	or perhaps a tabber or something
2014-03-30 22:44:42	@PikFan	it'd require quite a bit of coding
2014-03-30 22:45:01	@PikFan	also, those pictures you uploaded just now gave me an idea for a navbox

2014-03-30 23:19:04	Nepeta	 1. it is on the wiki
2014-03-30 23:19:29	Nepeta	 2. im just doing that so i can easily publish them with the horrid wii u keyboard
2014-03-30 23:19:34	Nepeta	later we can rename them right

2014-03-30 23:26:51	@J	thought I might've removed it when we never used it, though
2014-03-30 23:29:34	@J	if we're putting that in the template, we should probably have decent fallbacks for 1 and 0 images

2014-04-01 01:53:45	@Espyo	at the end, they give me less than 1% of what I have

2014-04-01 01:54:06	@PikFan	it's your cps
2014-04-01 01:54:07	@Espyo	plus it's just unfairly hard
2014-04-01 01:54:17	@PikFan	your cps is too low
2014-04-01 01:54:18	@Espyo	near the end, it just gets impossible to click

2014-04-01 01:54:33	@PikFan	it works for me
2014-04-01 01:54:35	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-04-01 01:54:45	@Espyo	still, probably the worst reason is because of the clicking on a wrinkler thing
2014-04-01 01:54:52	@PikFan	right
2014-04-01 01:54:52	@Espyo	and I dare not zoom

2014-04-01 01:55:32	@PikFan	for some reason when I zoom in the GCs appear in the left column
2014-04-01 01:55:38	Meisterbot	Cookie Clicker... on a bot
2014-04-01 01:55:43	@PikFan	always in the left column
2014-04-01 01:55:43	Meisterbot	dun dun DUN
2014-04-01 01:56:05	@PikFan	so they don't appear over wrinklers

2014-04-01 01:56:29	@PikFan	er, let me reword that

2014-04-02 21:27:02	@Espyo	if you don't, enable it real quick and add a bookmark

2014-04-03 19:53:18	@J	not entirely sure why
2014-04-03 19:53:21	@J	also some raisins
2014-04-03 19:53:31	@Espyo	that's no meal
2014-04-03 19:55:14	@J	oh, also some sweets, some jelly and 5 sandwiches
2014-04-03 19:55:46	@J	and a pork pie
2014-04-03 19:56:09	@Espyo	and they say I eat a lot
2014-04-03 19:56:28	@J	hey, that's not a lot
2014-04-03 19:56:54	@J	probably less than I normally eat, judging by how hungry I am
2014-04-03 19:58:37	@Espyo	I can eat 3 sandwiches for dinner
2014-04-03 19:58:41	@Espyo	 4 if I'm hungry
2014-04-03 19:58:50	@Espyo	 5 is only if I want to fatten up for a movie role
2014-04-03 19:58:54	@Espyo	 5 sandwiches plus all of that
2014-04-03 19:58:58	@Espyo	it's... it's just not possible
2014-04-03 19:59:06	@J	wait
2014-04-03 19:59:11	@J	that wasn't one meal
2014-04-03 19:59:26	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-03 19:59:32	@Espyo	you didn't do a good job separating it
2014-04-03 19:59:36	@J	I know
2014-04-03 20:00:15	@J	I mean, I could eat that much for one meal, but the amount of fruit would probably be weird
2014-04-03 20:00:48	@J	I didn't have any milk left, so I had fruit instead of cereal for breakfast
2014-04-03 20:00:59	@Espyo	hm, fair enough
2014-04-03 20:01:12	@J	didn't like the look of the soup at work, so the way it worked out I ended up with 2 apples
2014-04-03 20:01:32	@J	oh, also, a terrible thing happened today
2014-04-03 20:01:35	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-03 20:01:36	@Espyo	oh?
2014-04-03 20:01:50	@J	this morning, I was putting my trainers on while standing up
2014-04-03 20:01:59	@J	on one leg, I lost balance
2014-04-03 20:02:10	@J	and put out my hand against the wall to stop myself
2014-04-03 20:02:29	@J	as I reached out, I saw a spider right there, where I was going to put my hand, so I moved it to the side
2014-04-03 20:02:44	@J	but I was still falling
2014-04-03 20:02:55	@J	in the end, I headbutted the spider against the wall
2014-04-03 20:03:30	@J	('moved it to the side' - 'it' = 'my hand')
2014-04-03 20:05:46	@Espyo	so instead of squashing the buspider
2014-04-03 20:05:48	@Espyo	*spider
2014-04-03 20:06:00	@Espyo	("bug", backspace backspace, "spider")
2014-04-03 20:06:09	@Espyo	you ANNIHILATED it
2014-04-03 20:06:14	@Espyo	with an atomic falling headbutt
2014-04-03 20:06:37	@J	pretty much
2014-04-03 20:06:56	@J	it was bad for me too
2014-04-03 20:09:03	@Espyo	you can heal that off
2014-04-03 20:09:06	@Espyo	the spider can't heal THAT off
2014-04-03 20:09:30	@J	I also touched a spider with my head
2014-04-03 20:09:36	@J	the insides of a spider
2014-04-03 20:09:49	@Espyo	laksjdashd
2014-04-03 20:09:53	@Espyo	h-how big was it?
2014-04-03 20:10:01	@J	oh, not too big
2014-04-03 20:10:12	@J	but I'm sure it _had_ insides
2014-04-03 20:10:22	@J	it was one of those small ones, but with huge legs

2014-04-05 20:27:35	@Espyo	plus some 10 something text files
2014-04-05 20:27:42	@Espyo	normally that takes like 2-3 seconds here

2014-04-05 20:28:37	@Espyo	if you hover your mouse on the taskbar icon, does it show a blanked out window?
2014-04-05 20:28:47	@PikFan	no
2014-04-05 20:28:56	@PikFan	it shows the engine
2014-04-05 20:29:11	@Espyo	does it show an image like what you see in my screenshots and such?

2014-04-05 20:29:26	@Espyo	uh, the problem might be something stupid
2014-04-05 20:29:37	@Espyo	give this a try: hover your mouse there, then right-click the thumbnail it gives
2014-04-05 20:29:43	@Espyo	and choose uh...
2014-04-05 20:29:44	@Espyo	move...?
2014-04-05 20:30:06	@Espyo	where does your mouse cursor go when you do that?

2014-04-05 20:31:40	@Espyo	not really

2014-04-05 20:32:08	@Espyo	right click it and choose close to close it
2014-04-05 20:32:17	@Espyo	then go to the folder, and open Options.txt, it should've been created now
2014-04-05 20:32:33	@Espyo	scroll to the bottom of the text file until you find the likes of width = 640
2014-04-05 20:32:43	@Espyo	and change it to width = 1080
2014-04-05 20:32:47	@Espyo	then find height = 480

2014-04-05 20:33:03	@Espyo	hit save, and open the engine again
2014-04-05 20:33:18	@Espyo	that should make the window pretty big, and if it really exists, you should be able to see it peek somewhere
2014-04-05 20:34:10	@PikFan	...well, it zoomed out the preview

2014-04-05 20:39:08	@Espyo	let the mouse cursor move to the bottom-right
2014-04-05 20:39:13	@Espyo	and do not touch it
2014-04-05 20:39:20	@Espyo	instead, press the up key and the left key
2014-04-05 20:39:25	@Espyo	not together, but just keep pressing them
2014-04-05 20:39:31	@Espyo	hopefully this will make the window come into view

2014-04-05 20:40:07	@Espyo	ok, now has to why this happens:

2014-04-05 20:40:20	@Espyo	b) it's windows' fault

2014-04-05 20:41:45	@PikFan	I see
2014-04-05 20:41:45	@Espyo	also, the window is probably too huge for comfort
2014-04-05 20:41:53	@Espyo	close it and change the text file back to the old things

2014-04-05 20:46:42	@PikFan	hmm
2014-04-05 20:46:50	@PikFan	do the captains have infinite health?
2014-04-05 20:47:05	@Espyo	they can be hurt, but they can't die atm
2014-04-05 20:47:20	@Espyo	and I think the only way to get hurt is by calling specific code
2014-04-05 20:47:36	@Espyo	try pressing T (debugging tests), if that doesn't hurt the current leader, nothing will
2014-04-05 20:47:41	@Espyo	they can heal at the ship, though
2014-04-05 20:48:32	@PikFan	now I'm at day 10021
2014-04-05 20:48:52	@PikFan	pressing T jumps you 11 days into the future
2014-04-05 20:49:22	@Espyo	ah yes, that was probably my latest test
2014-04-05 20:49:31	@Espyo	testing to see if the day bubble can hold huge days
2014-04-05 20:49:34	@Espyo	and it can just nicely
2014-04-05 20:49:52	@PikFan	why aren't the Pikmin attacking the Cloaking Burrow-nit
2014-04-05 20:49:59	@Espyo	they can't yet
2014-04-05 20:50:03	@Espyo	attacks are a pretty common thing
2014-04-05 20:50:05	@PikFan	oh
2014-04-05 20:50:23	@Espyo	you have the NPC! games, please tell me what you think of using the spacebar to command the Pikmin
2014-04-05 20:50:33	@Espyo	better than NPC!, worse, ...?
2014-04-05 20:50:42	@PikFan	well
2014-04-05 20:51:01	@Espyo	>attacks a pretty common thing
2014-04-05 20:51:03	@PikFan	the whistle doesn't go out to the, uh... extended part of the cursor
2014-04-05 20:51:07	@Espyo	I'm VERY sure that's not the word I wanted
2014-04-05 20:51:16	@Espyo	I meant "recent", anyway
2014-04-05 20:51:24	@Espyo	as in: Pikmin only attack in my latest code
2014-04-05 20:51:36	@Espyo	extended?
2014-04-05 20:51:59	@Espyo	if your cursor turns see-through, it's too far away
2014-04-05 20:52:05	@Espyo	the "real" cursor is the pointy sphere
2014-04-05 20:52:20	@Espyo	rather, the pointy ring is the leader's cursor
2014-04-05 20:52:26	@Espyo	the spiny thing is your physical mouse
2014-04-05 20:52:39	@PikFan	yeah, that
2014-04-05 20:52:42	@Espyo	and the leader can only throw, call, etc. a certain distance
2014-04-05 20:52:48	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-05 20:52:59	@Espyo	I've seen videos, and that's how it is in the NPC! games, right?
2014-04-05 20:53:04	@PikFan	no
2014-04-05 20:53:27	@PikFan	in the NPC! games, the spinny part of the cursor allows you to whistle anywhere on screen
2014-04-05 20:53:34	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-05 20:53:47	@PikFan	the solid circle is where you throw Pikmin at
2014-04-05 20:54:00	@Espyo	...so if you zoom out to the farthest, you can call Pikmin from huge distances away?
2014-04-05 20:54:07	@Espyo	can you do the ground-level camera trick in NPC!?
2014-04-05 20:54:09	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-05 20:54:23	@PikFan	...ground-level camera trick?
2014-04-05 20:54:32	@PikFan	oh, that
2014-04-05 20:54:32	@Espyo	you know, hold R in the GCN version of Pikmin 2
2014-04-05 20:54:38	@Espyo	(should've specified it was P2)
2014-04-05 20:54:57	@PikFan	still only in P2, iirc
2014-04-05 20:55:05	@PikFan	(I don't own NPC! Pikmin)
2014-04-05 20:55:37	@PikFan	but yeah, you can call Pikmin from far away
2014-04-05 20:55:38	@Espyo	so, if you use that trick... you can call Pikmin from the Submerged Castle end of the Perplexing Pool, all the way from the other side of the map
2014-04-05 20:55:43	@Espyo	that is absolutely ridiculous
2014-04-05 20:55:53	@PikFan	I think so
2014-04-05 20:55:57	@Espyo	*Pikmin on the Submerged Castle
2014-04-05 20:56:01	@PikFan	if you managed to get the camera right
2014-04-05 20:56:06	@Espyo	right
2014-04-05 20:56:11	@Espyo	well, good thing I didn't make the whistle unlimited then
2014-04-05 20:56:16	@Espyo	because that's just bonkers
2014-04-05 20:56:30	@Espyo	NPC! players will find that awkward, but it's Nintendo's fault for allowing anywhere-whistling
2014-04-05 20:56:43	@PikFan	hah, they're so far away they become idle after the whistle stops
2014-04-05 20:56:51	@PikFan	so you can't even call them to you
2014-04-05 20:56:57	@Espyo	really?
2014-04-05 20:57:00	@PikFan	yep
2014-04-05 20:57:02	@Espyo	what if you keep whistling?
2014-04-05 20:57:17	@PikFan	they, uh... will slowly progress towards you
2014-04-05 20:57:22	@Espyo	pfft
2014-04-05 20:57:29	@Espyo	pretty sure that wasn't really intended
2014-04-05 20:57:37	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-05 20:57:54	@PikFan	happens because they're out of the captain's Pikmin zone
2014-04-05 20:58:02	@Espyo	what happens to the cursor in NPC! when it's out of the leader's throw range?
2014-04-05 20:58:06	@Espyo	graphically, I mean
2014-04-05 20:58:20	@PikFan	hm
2014-04-05 20:58:41	@PikFan	well, it acts just like how the engine's cursor works
2014-04-05 20:58:50	@PikFan	you can't go off screen though
2014-04-05 20:59:33	@PikFan	...are the Pikmin not able to go in yet?
2014-04-05 20:59:46	@Espyo	it becomes just an outline of those 4 curved dash things?
2014-04-05 20:59:47	@PikFan	*in the Onions
2014-04-05 20:59:51	@Espyo	nope, only out
2014-04-05 21:00:04	@PikFan	I see
2014-04-05 21:00:10	@PikFan	yep
2014-04-05 21:00:13	@Espyo	hm
2014-04-05 21:00:18	@Espyo	I've been thinking that I don't like it that way
2014-04-05 21:00:30	@PikFan	after it's out of the throwing things, it's only the 4 curved things
2014-04-05 21:00:31	@Espyo	because if you zoom out to the highest level, you almost won't be able to spot your cursor
2014-04-05 21:00:40	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-05 21:00:43	@Espyo	the trail effect helps you find it, but
2014-04-05 21:01:11	@Espyo	I've been thinking, if it's out of the pointy ring range, I should let it keep the "4 bold curved things" look
2014-04-05 21:01:13	@Espyo	but make it blink
2014-04-05 21:01:21	@Espyo	to symbolize that that's where it is, and it's easy to spot
2014-04-05 21:01:28	@Espyo	but the blinking shows that it's not a valid location
2014-04-05 21:02:09	@PikFan	the problem is is that it isn't bright enough
2014-04-05 21:02:24	@Espyo	really?
2014-04-05 21:02:27	@Espyo	is the NPC! one pinker?
2014-04-05 21:02:43	@PikFan	no, I'm talking about the engine pointer
2014-04-05 21:02:48	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-05 21:03:00	@Espyo	I suppose I should make it pinker, it's too violet now
2014-04-05 21:03:07	@PikFan	when the 4 things are in the throwing range, they're pink, just like the circle
2014-04-05 21:03:18	@PikFan	once outside, they become transparent
2014-04-05 21:03:28	@Espyo	not so much transparent as they become just outlines
2014-04-05 21:03:39	@Espyo	but yeah, that's the whole thing
2014-04-05 21:03:43	@PikFan	err, yeah
2014-04-05 21:03:44	@Espyo	just outlines make them incredibly hard to see
2014-04-05 21:03:52	@PikFan	right
2014-04-05 21:03:54	@Espyo	hence, I'll make it blink
2014-04-05 21:03:58	@PikFan	which is why you should fill them in
2014-04-05 21:04:02	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-05 21:04:15	@Espyo	I had to find something that symbolized an "invalid cursor" look
2014-04-05 21:04:20	@Espyo	and making it just outlines isn't the way to go
2014-04-05 21:04:30	@PikFan	yep
2014-04-05 21:04:36	@Espyo	plus the "invalid cursor" thing will be an important mechanic later on
2014-04-05 21:04:53	@Espyo	in the 3D games, you can see if a wall is too high for non-Yellows
2014-04-05 21:04:58	@Espyo	in a top-down game, there's no way
2014-04-05 21:05:13	@Espyo	so I'll have to make the cursor become "invalid" whenever you point at a high ledge, with a Pikmin type that can't reach it
2014-04-05 21:05:43	Meisterbot	but what if
2014-04-05 21:05:44	@PikFan	but
2014-04-05 21:05:45	Meisterbot	wait nvm
2014-04-05 21:06:01	@PikFan	what happens if a Pikmin reaches a place it's not supposed to
2014-04-05 21:06:11	@PikFan	then how do you whistle it?
2014-04-05 21:07:09	@Espyo	you don't
2014-04-05 21:07:18	@Espyo	if you were able to throw it there, you are able to call it back
2014-04-05 21:07:28	@Espyo	it's impossible to throw a Pikmin into a location your cursor can't reach
2014-04-05 21:07:39	@Espyo	that's only possible in the GCN games because some surfaces have slippery ledges
2014-04-05 21:07:46	@Espyo	like the out-of-bounds area on the Impact Site
2014-04-05 21:07:55	@Espyo	slippery ledges don't exist in the engine
2014-04-05 21:08:30	@Espyo	but note that a cursor becoming "invalid" probably doesn't mean what you think it means

2014-04-05 21:30:38	Los_Plagas	How sad
2014-04-05 21:30:44	@Espyo	what happened?
2014-04-05 21:31:23	Los_Plagas	Well, besides finals and all that, my computer broke down and I had to get another one with my limited budget. And plus I got lazy, too
2014-04-05 21:31:34	Los_Plagas	And I failed my duty to update the Facebook page
2014-04-05 21:31:47	Los_Plagas	So studies + slight plunge into despair = no activty

2014-04-05 21:32:44	@Espyo	yes
2014-04-05 21:32:52	Los_Plagas	I can tell I missed a lot
2014-04-05 21:32:58	@Espyo	sure did
2014-04-05 21:33:01	Los_Plagas	At least one new feature for Testyo and a . . . new bot?

2014-04-05 21:33:13	@Espyo	you were this close to missing the biggest visual change on Pikipedia
2014-04-05 21:33:22	Meisterbot	(totally not a bot)
2014-04-05 21:33:25	Los_Plagas	Did we get a new background>
2014-04-05 21:33:26	@Espyo	Meisterbot is ThePikminMeister speaking through his bot
2014-04-05 21:33:34	Los_Plagas	Oh
2014-04-05 21:33:37	Meisterbot	most times it is
2014-04-05 21:33:38	@Espyo	we didn't yet, but we've been talking about it lately
2014-04-05 21:34:13	Los_Plagas	I was wondering when that was going to start up again
2014-04-05 21:34:25	@Espyo	Testyo: poll 6
2014-04-05 21:34:25	Testyo	Poll #6: http://89.154.18.238:8080/Pikipedia/polls#6
2014-04-05 21:34:31	Los_Plagas	Also, is it just me or does the login page look slightly different?
2014-04-05 21:34:44	@Espyo	the previous poll is also relevant
2014-04-05 21:34:51	@Espyo	it does, looks like a global MediaWiki change
2014-04-05 21:34:56	@Espyo	other MW wikis have that change too

2014-04-05 21:36:15	Los_Plagas	I do like the images though
2014-04-05 21:36:33	Los_Plagas	But I kind of wish they related to Pikmin a bit more . . . still, anything's better than what we have now
2014-04-05 21:36:47	@Espyo	those are in-game textures
2014-04-05 21:36:56	@Espyo	it's better to keep it simple, concise, and straight to the point
2014-04-05 21:36:57	Los_Plagas	I noticed
2014-04-05 21:37:02	Los_Plagas	Yeah, I guess
2014-04-05 21:37:16	Los_Plagas	But without closer examination, they don't LOOK like in-game textures
2014-04-05 21:37:20	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-04-05 21:37:22	@Espyo	maybe some more Pikmin-related things would be better
2014-04-05 21:37:24	Los_Plagas	But they're definitely good
2014-04-05 21:37:29	@Espyo	but we don't have any way of doing that without screwing everything up
2014-04-05 21:37:35	@Espyo	i.e. without making some horrible background
2014-04-05 21:38:05	@Espyo	we could use some official concept art wallpaper, like /wikia/
2014-04-05 21:38:11	@Espyo	but that's so distracting and so wikiaish
2014-04-05 21:38:14	Los_Plagas	I guess someone with PhotoShop could insert a Pikmin or enemy somewhere . . . but I don't know if there's any images of those things that could adequately blend into the picture without looking obviously Phtoshopped
2014-04-05 21:38:28	Los_Plagas	I really don't like Wikia's colour scheme
2014-04-05 21:38:29	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-05 21:38:50	Los_Plagas	And plus we're trying to set ourselves apart
2014-04-05 21:39:01	Los_Plagas	At the very least I definitely wouldn't support using the /same/ imag

2014-04-05 21:44:20	Meisterbot	actually, nvm
2014-04-05 21:45:11	Los_Plagas	Also, I haven't figured this out and am too lazy to look it up
2014-04-05 21:45:27	Los_Plagas	Has Wikia also claimed the title "Pikipedia," or are they just Pikmin wiki and Pikipedia our own name?
2014-04-05 21:45:55	@Espyo	they're still Pikmin Wiki, and we are Pikipedia
2014-04-05 21:46:08	Los_Plagas	Okay, good

2014-04-05 21:54:32	Los_Plagas	Are you talking about Wikia?
2014-04-05 21:54:49	Los_Plagas	They're not necessarily "noobs" in my opinion; some of them /are/ experienced
2014-04-05 21:55:03	Meisterbot	i will add things to wikia
2014-04-05 21:55:06	Meisterbot	and join their side

2014-04-05 21:56:13	Los_Plagas	I recall seeing something like that there

2014-04-06 01:44:19	@PikFan	what happened?
2014-04-06 01:44:24	@Espyo	huge pain
2014-04-06 01:44:29	@Espyo	annoying everybody with petty things
2014-04-06 01:44:42	@PikFan	logs, please
2014-04-06 01:44:57	@PikFan	also, Los Plagas came here?

2014-04-06 01:45:48	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-06 01:46:47	@PikFan	bah
2014-04-06 01:47:05	@PikFan	idiot needs to learn not everybody has the same interests
2014-04-06 01:47:18	@Espyo	idiot needs to learn patience
2014-04-06 01:47:26	@Espyo	and it's incredible how he asks Testyo if he's gay

2014-04-06 01:48:00	@PikFan	well we should probably give him an extremely stern warning when he returns
2014-04-06 01:48:07	@PikFan	...actually
2014-04-06 01:48:12	@PikFan	that's a bad idea
2014-04-06 01:48:18	@Espyo	I did say that if he keeps it up, he's gone for good
2014-04-06 01:48:37	@PikFan	yeah, needs to be pithy
2014-04-06 01:49:11	Spark	who, los plagas or tzb?
2014-04-06 01:49:15	@Espyo	tzb
2014-04-06 01:49:28	@Espyo	anyway PikFan, back to what we were talking about before you left
2014-04-06 01:49:51	@Espyo	it's more like the cursor being "invalid" is just used for general information
2014-04-06 01:50:00	@Espyo	context-sensitive, if you want to put it that way
2014-04-06 01:50:06	@PikFan	right
2014-04-06 01:50:21	@Espyo	if the cursor is "invalid" because it's too far from the pointy ring, that means it's an invalid place to throw or whistle
2014-04-06 01:50:31	@Espyo	and the throw/whistle'll be limited to the pointy ring range
2014-04-06 01:50:38	@PikFan	hm
2014-04-06 01:50:46	@Espyo	but if it's inside that range, and it shows invalid, then the problem is just the platform you're pointing at that's out of reach
2014-04-06 01:51:05	@Espyo	even: if the cursor is "invalid", you cannot throw a Pikmin to this spot, end of story
2014-04-06 01:51:23	@PikFan	doesn't mean it's impossible for it to get there
2014-04-06 01:51:25	@Espyo	the fact that you also can't whistle that point when it's after the pointy ring is just an unrelatedthing
2014-04-06 01:51:30	@Espyo	*unrelated thing
2014-04-06 01:51:34	@Espyo	nope, it doesn't
2014-04-06 01:51:45	@Espyo	but for the current throw, in the current positions and all, you can't
2014-04-06 01:51:57	@Espyo	unless you actually can make it by a split-pixel
2014-04-06 01:52:10	@Espyo	the game throws Pikmin not in a set arc, but with physics taken into account
2014-04-06 01:52:14	@Espyo	and that happens over time
2014-04-06 01:52:18	@PikFan	mm
2014-04-06 01:52:30	@Espyo	and calculating whether or not something will reach a spot /instantly/ is a whole different story
2014-04-06 01:52:47	@Espyo	so the estimation of "you can reach this ledge" or "you cannot reach this ledge" probably isn't 100% accurate
2014-04-06 01:52:50	@Espyo	but it's more than good enough
2014-04-06 01:53:18	@Espyo	again, only if you're super lucky and make it through by a pixel
2014-04-06 01:53:22	@Espyo	but whatever
2014-04-06 01:53:45	@Espyo	now I'm working on rewriting the way animations work
2014-04-06 01:53:51	@Espyo	and it's really tough...
2014-04-06 01:53:58	@Espyo	and it's so dull...
2014-04-06 01:54:10	@Espyo	on that note, have you checked the most recent change to the engine's discussion?

2014-04-06 01:56:08	@Espyo	instead of "Forum:"
2014-04-06 01:57:09	@Espyo	that = the question on the thread?
2014-04-06 01:57:51	@PikFan	yeah, this http://www.pikminfanon.com/Topic:Pikmin_Engine_by_Espyo#Editors
2014-04-06 01:58:47	@Espyo	hm, ok, so you know how the game makers are going to have to create their own animations for stuff?
2014-04-06 01:58:56	@Espyo	like the moving Cloaking Burrow-nit I currently have
2014-04-06 01:59:10	@Espyo	the animation for when it unburrows, the animation for when it walks, etc.
2014-04-06 01:59:23	@Espyo	ideally, how do you imagine doing it?
2014-04-06 01:59:32	@Espyo	like, you open up the editor, ready to start some animations
2014-04-06 01:59:34	@Espyo	and then what?
2014-04-06 01:59:45	@Espyo	what menus are in front of you?
2014-04-06 01:59:48	@Espyo	what options?
2014-04-06 01:59:50	@Espyo	how is everything made?
2014-04-06 02:02:19	@PikFan	ah, sorry, reading something
2014-04-06 02:02:28	@PikFan	hmmm
2014-04-06 02:02:57	@PikFan	I don't know
2014-04-06 02:03:16	@PikFan	it would depend on the type of enemy
2014-04-06 02:04:33	@Espyo	gimme an example
2014-04-06 02:04:44	@PikFan	mmm
2014-04-06 02:04:47	@PikFan	Red Bulborb
2014-04-06 02:04:47	@Espyo	again, this is all hypothetical and in your ideal engine environment
2014-04-06 02:05:06	@PikFan	let's see...
2014-04-06 02:05:23	@PikFan	it has an awakening animation and a sleeping animation
2014-04-06 02:05:38	@PikFan	then it has a bite animation
2014-04-06 02:05:47	Meisterbot	wait
2014-04-06 02:05:50	@Espyo	right, how would you make those?
2014-04-06 02:05:55	Meisterbot	we have to make our own animationds
2014-04-06 02:05:59	@PikFan	if it grabs a Pikmin, it has a swallow animation; if not, a trip animation
2014-04-06 02:06:00	Meisterbot	im screwed
2014-04-06 02:06:10	@PikFan	mm
2014-04-06 02:06:14	@PikFan	let's see...
2014-04-06 02:06:31	@Espyo	Meisterbot: if your enemy is a recolor, it's millions of times easier
2014-04-06 02:06:38	@PikFan	I'd imagine classifying the animations
2014-04-06 02:06:45	Meisterbot	but if it isnt...
2014-04-06 02:06:51	@Espyo	all right, maybe I'm not reaching the point I want to
2014-04-06 02:06:56	@PikFan	one category could be aesthetics
2014-04-06 02:07:01	@PikFan	another could be attacks
2014-04-06 02:07:09	@Espyo	to make the actual animation
2014-04-06 02:07:22	@Espyo	the actual moving of the leg from the back position to the front, and back again
2014-04-06 02:07:25	@Espyo	same to the other one
2014-04-06 02:07:29	@Espyo	and the wobble of the body
2014-04-06 02:07:33	@Espyo	you know, what makes up walking
2014-04-06 02:07:39	@PikFan	oh
2014-04-06 02:08:01	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-04-06 02:08:15	@Espyo	you're completely in the dark
2014-04-06 02:08:16	@Espyo	*?
2014-04-06 02:08:24	@PikFan	pretty much
2014-04-06 02:08:29	@Espyo	hm
2014-04-06 02:08:32	@Espyo	how about you, TPM?
2014-04-06 02:08:44	@Espyo	how would you imagine the game to make the animations, if not have you make them yourself?
2014-04-06 02:08:46	@PikFan	I'll figure it out though
2014-04-06 02:09:00	@Espyo	PikFan: unbiased from any existing method or editor
2014-04-06 02:09:18	@PikFan	I see
2014-04-06 02:09:20	@Espyo	I just want you to visualize the steps and tools required to make the legs of the Bulborb go back and forth
2014-04-06 02:09:27	Meisterbot	hm?
2014-04-06 02:09:32	Meisterbot	was i summoned?
2014-04-06 02:09:41	@PikFan	well
2014-04-06 02:09:43	@Espyo	yeah, question
2014-04-06 02:09:54	Meisterbot	oh
2014-04-06 02:10:04	@PikFan	in order to make the legs move smoothly, I'd need some sort of image manipulator program
2014-04-06 02:10:10	Meisterbot	i dont understand the question
2014-04-06 02:10:15	@Espyo	right
2014-04-06 02:10:21	@Espyo	ok, the game makers have to make their own animations
2014-04-06 02:10:26	@Espyo	you thought that that wasn't the case, right?
2014-04-06 02:10:27	Meisterbot	hmm
2014-04-06 02:10:33	Meisterbot	sort of
2014-04-06 02:11:01	@Espyo	well, how do you think the game would animate stuff for you?
2014-04-06 02:11:08	Meisterbot	uh
2014-04-06 02:11:10	Meisterbot	idk
2014-04-06 02:11:18	@Espyo	not a rhetorical question, I really want to know what you can visualize
2014-04-06 02:11:23	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:11:26	Meisterbot	let me think for a sec
2014-04-06 02:11:47	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-06 02:12:06	Meisterbot	yeah...i cant think of anything
2014-04-06 02:12:15	@Espyo	right...
2014-04-06 02:12:20	@Espyo	ok, at the moment, it works as follows:
2014-04-06 02:12:29	@Espyo	you draw an image of the Bulborb standing normal
2014-04-06 02:12:40	@Espyo	then, you draw an image of the Bulborb with the left foot slightly to the front
2014-04-06 02:12:46	@Espyo	then another, a bit more to the front
2014-04-06 02:12:52	@Espyo	and then another with the leg fully stretched
2014-04-06 02:12:56	@Espyo	and so on and so forth
2014-04-06 02:13:03	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:13:04	@Espyo	one image for every bit of the movement
2014-04-06 02:13:06	@Espyo	and then in the engine
2014-04-06 02:13:09	Meisterbot	its a little complicated
2014-04-06 02:13:12	Meisterbot	ill learn
2014-04-06 02:13:19	@Espyo	you pick the animation you want to build, like the walking animation
2014-04-06 02:13:34	@Espyo	and tell it to use the image of the left leg slightly to the front first
2014-04-06 02:13:36	@Espyo	then the other one
2014-04-06 02:13:39	@Espyo	then the other one
2014-04-06 02:13:45	@Espyo	and that's what causes animation
2014-04-06 02:13:49	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:13:51	@Espyo	this is the method pretty much most games use
2014-04-06 02:13:57	Meisterbot	i'm not good with animating
2014-04-06 02:14:01	@Espyo	I wanted to know if you could imagine any other method
2014-04-06 02:14:09	Meisterbot	no
2014-04-06 02:14:19	@Espyo	even if it is "print a 3D bulborb, move its legs around in real-time, and record it"
2014-04-06 02:14:30	Meisterbot	lol
2014-04-06 02:14:38	@Espyo	it's complicated, but it's precisely why I needed feedback for other ideas
2014-04-06 02:14:43	@Espyo	but I guess it'll have to be that way
2014-04-06 02:14:52	@Espyo	and then I'll write some tutorial to make animation as easy as possible
2014-04-06 02:14:54	Meisterbot	i thought of something
2014-04-06 02:15:01	Meisterbot	but it's a little confusing
2014-04-06 02:15:03	@Espyo	sure, go ahead
2014-04-06 02:15:08	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:15:26	Meisterbot	so, you draw the thing in the normal position
2014-04-06 02:15:55	Meisterbot	then, you outline the legs, or whatever you want animated
2014-04-06 02:16:08	Meisterbot	and you only have to change those things in the program
2014-04-06 02:16:17	Meisterbot	something like that
2014-04-06 02:16:23	@Espyo	mhm, I see what you mean
2014-04-06 02:16:35	@Espyo	well, truth be told, THAT is pretty much how I make my animations
2014-04-06 02:16:40	@Espyo	I don't draw each one individually
2014-04-06 02:16:48	@Espyo	I draw the whole creature
2014-04-06 02:16:52	@Espyo	and when I have to move a leg forward
2014-04-06 02:16:56	@Espyo	I select just the leg
2014-04-06 02:16:58	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:16:58	@Espyo	and move it forward
2014-04-06 02:17:06	@Espyo	this happens outside of the editor
2014-04-06 02:17:09	Meisterbot	something just installed on my computer
2014-04-06 02:17:13	Meisterbot	wth
2014-04-06 02:17:19	@Espyo	dunno
2014-04-06 02:17:21	@Espyo	oh, PikFan!
2014-04-06 02:17:28	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-04-06 02:17:32	@Espyo	Ortiel says that wrinklers now stay in your save file
2014-04-06 02:17:37	@Espyo	as per the updates tab
2014-04-06 02:17:43	@Espyo	I'll pop mine in a week, see what happens
2014-04-06 02:17:44	@PikFan	*Orteil
2014-04-06 02:17:48	@Espyo	uh, yeah
2014-04-06 02:17:51	@PikFan	uh...
2014-04-06 02:17:59	@PikFan	I refreshed
2014-04-06 02:18:05	@PikFan	and the wrinklers disappeared
2014-04-06 02:18:08	@Espyo	...
2014-04-06 02:18:16	@Espyo	maybe after the latest update only?
2014-04-06 02:18:16	@PikFan	(well, to test his claim)
2014-04-06 02:18:19	@Espyo	or maybe it's not working
2014-04-06 02:18:25	@PikFan	latter, likely
2014-04-06 02:18:37	@PikFan	hmm, let me see
2014-04-06 02:18:42	@Espyo	 05/04/2014 - pity the fool     -wrinklers should now be saved so you don't have to pop them everytime you refresh the game
2014-04-06 02:18:52	@PikFan	probably don't have many cookies on these wrinklers
2014-04-06 02:18:59	@PikFan	save...
2014-04-06 02:19:04	@PikFan	refresh...
2014-04-06 02:19:18	@PikFan	yep, gone
2014-04-06 02:19:29	@Espyo	...don't tell me it's not working
2014-04-06 02:19:32	@PikFan	wait
2014-04-06 02:19:46	@PikFan	four wrinklers appeared simultaneously
2014-04-06 02:20:12	@PikFan	refreshed
2014-04-06 02:20:16	@PikFan	again four wrinklers
2014-04-06 02:21:54	@PikFan	Orteil also needs to fix GCs over wrinklers
2014-04-06 02:22:12	Meisterbot	GCs?
2014-04-06 02:22:12	@Espyo	ah, good
2014-04-06 02:22:16	@Espyo	and yeah, he does
2014-04-06 02:22:21	@PikFan	Golden Cookie
2014-04-06 02:22:23	@Espyo	ok, going to bed now
2014-04-06 02:22:25	Meisterbot	k

2014-04-06 02:22:31	@PikFan	and apparently, black cat's paw
2014-04-06 02:22:33	Meisterbot	night
2014-04-06 02:22:34	@PikFan	wait
2014-04-06 02:22:40	@Espyo	black cat's paw...?
2014-04-06 02:22:40	@PikFan	is a normal achievement now
2014-04-06 02:22:49	@Espyo	what's that one?
2014-04-06 02:22:49	@PikFan	7777 GCs
2014-04-06 02:22:52	@Espyo	crud
2014-04-06 02:22:54	@Espyo	all time?
2014-04-06 02:22:58	@PikFan	yes
2014-04-06 02:23:03	@PikFan	it was shadow
2014-04-06 02:23:07	@PikFan	now it's normal
2014-04-06 02:23:11	@Espyo	...I'm still at 2K
2014-04-06 02:23:11	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -456.07 °F
2014-04-06 02:23:19	@PikFan	good thing too, 50 GCs away
2014-04-06 02:23:30	@PikFan	anyway, night

2014-04-06 02:24:34	<--	Testyo (Testyo@l31-551-08-828.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: sleep)
2014-04-06 02:24:44	Meisterbot	so now
2014-04-06 02:24:47	Meisterbot	its just us
2014-04-06 02:27:21	Meisterbot	13 quadrillion cookies
2014-04-06 02:27:45	@PikFan	all time?
2014-04-06 02:27:50	Meisterbot	no
2014-04-06 02:27:52	Meisterbot	right now
2014-04-06 02:27:56	@PikFan	bank?
2014-04-06 02:28:23	Meisterbot	i think so
2014-04-06 02:29:25	@PikFan	92 quintillion
2014-04-06 02:29:26	@PikFan	bank
2014-04-06 02:29:46	Meisterbot	aaahh
2014-04-06 02:29:54	Meisterbot	im so behind
2014-04-06 02:30:01	@PikFan	no you're not
2014-04-06 02:30:15	Meisterbot	yes
2014-04-06 02:30:21	@PikFan	Nepeta has like
2014-04-06 02:30:25	Meisterbot	13 quad compared to 92 quint
2014-04-06 02:30:31	@PikFan	septillions of cookies
2014-04-06 02:30:38	Meisterbot	...
2014-04-06 02:30:42	@PikFan	which are like
2014-04-06 02:30:49	@PikFan	millions of quintillions
2014-04-06 02:31:05	Meisterbot	woah
2014-04-06 02:32:49	Meisterbot	so anyway, i was thinking of how you could make a jeopardy bot
2014-04-06 02:33:10	@PikFan	mhm
2014-04-06 02:33:26	Meisterbot	i couldnt think of any ways
2014-04-06 02:33:39	Meisterbot	but i'm not too good with scripting
2014-04-06 02:34:05	@PikFan	here's how I see it working:
2014-04-06 02:34:22	@PikFan	there are three to six players
2014-04-06 02:34:35	Meisterbot	that part is easy
2014-04-06 02:34:59	@PikFan	sorry, interrupted by something
2014-04-06 02:35:02	Meisterbot	k
2014-04-06 02:35:10	@PikFan	one of the players is the judge
2014-04-06 02:35:20	Meisterbot	for each round?
2014-04-06 02:35:27	@PikFan	for the whole game
2014-04-06 02:35:31	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:35:35	Meisterbot	that part is easy
2014-04-06 02:35:36	@PikFan	the other players think
2014-04-06 02:35:57	@PikFan	the first person to come up with an answer will say Answer
2014-04-06 02:36:10	@PikFan	then they present their answer
2014-04-06 02:36:11	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:36:18	Meisterbot	a little hard
2014-04-06 02:36:32	@PikFan	the judge decides if it's correct or incorrect
2014-04-06 02:36:40	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:36:56	@PikFan	if it's correct, the judge says True; if not, they say False
2014-04-06 02:37:02	Meisterbot	but wait
2014-04-06 02:37:11	Meisterbot	if a player is the judge
2014-04-06 02:37:16	Meisterbot	what is a bot needed for
2014-04-06 02:37:22	@PikFan	the bot will give or take points based on what the judge says
2014-04-06 02:37:31	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:38:03	Meisterbot	well, hopefully u are able to get that working
2014-04-06 02:38:07	Meisterbot	that would be fun
2014-04-06 02:38:12	@PikFan	if the judge says False, that player cannot answer again for the question
2014-04-06 02:38:25	@PikFan	so the other players have an opportunity to answer
2014-04-06 02:38:40	Meisterbot	k
2014-04-06 02:39:02	@PikFan	if nobody answers within the 10 second time period, they lose that question
2014-04-06 02:39:21	@PikFan	if someone gets a question right, they get to pick the next question
2014-04-06 02:39:33	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-06 02:39:46	@PikFan	so they would write, for example, Pikmin for 50
2014-04-06 02:40:09	@PikFan	brb
2014-04-06 02:40:13	Meisterbot	k
2014-04-06 02:41:03	Meisterbot	i might try to make jeopardy for meisterbot
2014-04-06 02:41:53	Meisterbot	i can see a lot of text files being needed
2014-04-06 02:42:00	Meisterbot	to select a random question
2014-04-06 02:42:13	Meisterbot	but i'm not sure how the answer would be shown
2014-04-06 03:16:49	Meisterbot	and then it becomes quiet

2014-04-06 03:35:22	Meisterbot	wait...
2014-04-06 03:35:23	Meisterbot	TZB
2014-04-06 03:35:28	@PikFan	olol
2014-04-06 03:35:29	Meisterbot	i think
2014-04-06 03:39:45	Meisterbot	its either tzb or cactus
2014-04-06 03:40:35	Meisterbot	i thought of a game i could add to meisterbot during my tutorial series
2014-04-06 03:41:32	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-04-06 03:41:40	Meisterbot	so, there are two teams
2014-04-06 03:41:50	Meisterbot	one team starts up
2014-04-06 03:42:01	Meisterbot	one of the players from that team is given a word
2014-04-06 03:42:47	Meisterbot	they have to describe the word so that their team members will guess it
2014-04-06 03:43:00	@PikFan	interesting
2014-04-06 03:43:01	Meisterbot	and there is a time limit
2014-04-06 03:43:13	Meisterbot	and you have to try to get as many points as possib;e
2014-04-06 03:43:16	Meisterbot	possible

2014-04-06 16:14:20	@Espyo	http://sprunge.us/dBGG
2014-04-06 16:14:31	@Espyo	I wonder how it says that those inline functions aren't defined, yet uses them like it's no big deal
2014-04-06 16:14:35	@Espyo	you know what, screw inline
2014-04-06 16:14:41	@Espyo	who needs optimizations and performance, anyway
2014-04-06 16:14:48	@Espyo	C++ is horrible with inlines
2014-04-06 16:14:50	@Espyo	C too, probably
2014-04-06 16:19:08	@J	those _are_ just warnings
2014-04-06 16:19:30	@Espyo	yes, but they make no sense anyway
2014-04-06 16:19:50	@J	so, do you not get the huge lag when whistling the group of Pikmin?
2014-04-06 16:20:05	@J	that doesn't really seem like an OS-/compiler-dependent thing
2014-04-06 16:21:21	@Espyo	not huge... but there's definitely some lag with an origin I haven't pin-pointed yet
2014-04-06 16:21:28	@Espyo	it drops the framerate by about 3FPS
2014-04-06 16:23:20	@Espyo	can't test right now, anyway
2014-04-06 16:23:33	@Espyo	I'm working on a new animation editor, and a re-write of the animation code
2014-04-06 16:23:50	@Espyo	I used to have an animation, that contains a list of frames, and every frame contains a list of hitboxes
2014-04-06 16:23:57	@Espyo	but I realized that's a bit redundant after a bit
2014-04-06 16:24:05	@Espyo	like the "body" hitbox on a Cloaking Burrow-nit
2014-04-06 16:24:14	@Espyo	the body is always a "normal"-type hitbox
2014-04-06 16:24:32	@Espyo	and it always has a 1.2x defense multiplier (not sure how it is in Pikmin 2, but c'mon, that thick hide has to provide some extra defense)
2014-04-06 16:24:56	@Espyo	currently I need to create that "body" hitbox for every frame of every animation, properties and all
2014-04-06 16:25:07	@Espyo	the new way, I'll just have a list of frames, and a list of hitboxes
2014-04-06 16:25:11	@Espyo	independent
2014-04-06 16:25:18	@Espyo	and a frame can contain instances of hitboxes
2014-04-06 16:25:39	@Espyo	and an animation contains instances of frames, so I can say something like "1,2,3,4,5,4,5,4,5,6,7,8" for an animation
2014-04-06 16:28:48	@J	[16:21:28] @Espyo it drops the framerate by about 3FPS
2014-04-06 16:28:57	@J	definitely not the same thing, then
2014-04-06 16:30:19	@J	might be nice to be able to define a group of hitboxes as a single hitbox
2014-04-06 16:32:42	@Espyo	good thinking
2014-04-06 16:32:52	@Espyo	I'll consider it if I realize it becomes really needful
2014-04-06 16:33:10	@Espyo	...one of those words sounds awkward, and I can't tell which
2014-04-06 16:33:32	@J	needful
2014-04-06 16:33:42	@Espyo	Firefox says it's a word
2014-04-06 16:33:42	@J	probably -> necessary
2014-04-06 16:33:49	@Espyo	hm

2014-04-06 20:09:30	@PikFan	depends on what you call super hard
2014-04-06 20:09:34	Nepeta	i like the time limit
2014-04-06 20:09:38	Nepeta	made it challenging

2014-04-06 20:09:41	Nepeta	and i like a challenge
2014-04-06 20:11:01	@PikFan	so is there something you need me to do for the DLC
2014-04-06 20:11:40	Nepeta	well
2014-04-06 20:11:48	Nepeta	i just wondered if anybody thought that

2014-04-06 20:12:00	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-06 20:12:02	@PikFan	it is
2014-04-06 20:12:12	Nepeta	especially in defea enemies cuz the blue onion is in the same spot
2014-04-06 20:12:22	@PikFan	...really?
2014-04-06 20:12:24	Nepeta	yeah thats what i thought but i wanted to make sure that i wasnt bonkers
2014-04-06 20:12:27	@PikFan	now that's interesting

2014-04-06 20:13:14	@PikFan	just have a lot of Pikmin 3 decoration thingies
2014-04-06 20:14:34	@Espyo	yes visual studio, you are correct
2014-04-06 20:14:44	@Espyo	a scrollbar does not have a "make_widget_scr" function
2014-04-06 20:14:44	Nepeta	thanks espyo
2014-04-06 20:14:46	Nepeta	but my name is enepta
2014-04-06 20:14:52	Nepeta	enepta
2014-04-06 20:14:57	@Espyo	that's why I have "make_widget_scroll" instead
2014-04-06 20:15:01	Nepeta	i should go and learn how to type brb

2014-04-08 22:13:31	@J	did you hear about the OpenSSL bug?
2014-04-08 22:15:37	@Espyo	I heard someone mention some SSL vulnerability on another network

2014-04-08 22:21:15	@J	it's a vulnerability in most of the internet
2014-04-08 22:21:43	@J	not sure if it affects SSH, but probably does
2014-04-08 22:21:49	@J	(that's in addition to HTTPS)
2014-04-08 22:23:36	@Espyo	youch
2014-04-08 22:26:44	@J	ah, apparently not SSH

2014-04-08 22:29:54	@Espyo	how did that happen then
2014-04-08 22:29:55	@Espyo	*?
2014-04-08 22:34:23	@J	how?  How does any bug in code happen?
2014-04-08 22:34:42	@Espyo	yeah, but I mean, SSL has been around for years
2014-04-08 22:35:03	@J	it's not a bug in SSL, but specifically in the OpenSSL implementation
2014-04-08 22:35:15	@J	but it still has been in the code for years
2014-04-08 22:35:20	@J	just no-one noticed
2014-04-08 22:35:58	@J	OpenSSL is largely maintained by volunteers 
2014-04-08 22:36:16	@J	I don't think it has as much corporate/government funding/backing as it should
2014-04-08 22:36:23	@J	considering how many people use it
2014-04-08 22:37:29	Nepeta	barnacles!
2014-04-08 22:37:36	@J	my thoughts exactly
2014-04-08 22:45:54	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-08 22:48:55	@J	so, today I used my laptop outside (yes, I visited the outside world)
2014-04-08 22:49:28	@J	I mounted the filesystem on my desktop running at home via SSH, via my Raspberry Pi
2014-04-08 22:49:53	@J	it worked surprisingly well, even with café wifi
2014-04-08 22:50:29	@J	and I was running the OS from a USB drive, since the hard drive died a while back
2014-04-08 22:51:04	@J	so I wasn't actually sure whether it would be faster to copy the code I was working on to that drive, or work over the network
2014-04-08 22:51:12	@J	considering how slow USB drives are

2014-04-11 19:32:47	@Espyo	between?
2014-04-11 19:32:48	@Espyo	what
2014-04-11 19:35:36	@Espyo	that's pretty cool, actually
2014-04-11 19:38:45	@J	don't you work out between workout breaks?
2014-04-11 19:39:12	@Espyo	hehe, putting to use that little trick that was discovered in Torvus Bog, recently
2014-04-11 19:39:12	@Espyo	nice
2014-04-11 19:39:17	@Espyo	uh... I get what you mean now
2014-04-11 19:39:20	@Espyo	indeed I do
2014-04-11 19:52:31	@Espyo	sub hour...
2014-04-11 19:52:33	@Espyo	just amazing

2014-04-11 20:35:43	@Espyo	J: I think I know why the engine is slow when you whistle Pikmin
2014-04-11 20:36:03	@Espyo	whenever you whistle one, it tries to find a spot in the party's "sphere of locations"
2014-04-11 20:36:12	@Espyo	...it does this by picking points at random until one is free
2014-04-11 20:36:25	@Espyo	for me, I can see FRAPS jitter from 30FPS to 29FPS in a blink of an eye
2014-04-11 20:36:37	@Espyo	but apparently your luck sucks, 'cause you say it drops sharply
2014-04-11 20:54:02	@J	that sounds like a terrible approach
2014-04-11 20:54:16	@J	but I'm not convinced, since it happens every single time

2014-04-11 20:54:38	@J	[20:54:02] @J that sounds like a terrible approach
2014-04-11 20:54:38	@J	[20:54:16] @J but I'm not convinced, since it happens every single time
2014-04-11 20:54:40	@J	we're talking 60FPS to 0.2FPS
2014-04-11 20:55:20	@J	but yeah, you should just track free spots and allocate them as you need
2014-04-11 20:55:36	@J	or, you mean it's a continuum?
2014-04-11 20:56:01	@J	I mean, rather than picking one of a number of known spots, it picks any point in some circle?
2014-04-11 20:56:28	@J	probably would be better to pre-allocate based on radius
2014-04-11 20:57:53	@Espyo	all right, a few confusing things happen here
2014-04-11 20:58:00	@Espyo	uh, the "circle" is made of rings
2014-04-11 20:58:16	@Espyo	and each "ring" is made of spots
2014-04-11 20:58:20	@J	I think we vaguely discussed this before
2014-04-11 20:58:23	@Espyo	obviously, the first, centermost ring is only 1 point
2014-04-11 20:58:26	@Espyo	we did, just recapping
2014-04-11 20:58:31	@Espyo	the second ring has like 6 spots
2014-04-11 20:58:35	@Espyo	third has 20 or so
2014-04-11 20:58:58	@Espyo	and until the second ring's spots are fully occupied, a Pikmin won't care about ring 3
2014-04-11 20:58:59	@Espyo	and so on
2014-04-11 20:59:14	@Espyo	when it joins a group, imagine that the current ring is 5
2014-04-11 20:59:30	@Espyo	and it has 50 spots, with 40 of them filled
2014-04-11 20:59:49	@Espyo	instead of picking a number between 0 and 9, and going to the appropriate free spot
2014-04-11 21:00:08	@Espyo	it just keeps picking from 0-50, and if the spot in the ring it picked is occupied, tries again
2014-04-11 21:00:18	@Espyo	but yeah, shouldn't reduce to 0.2FPS, that's insane
2014-04-11 21:00:43	@Espyo	try renaming Pikmin_called.ogg to something else?
2014-04-11 21:01:00	@Espyo	maybe the problem is the 60+ Pikmin being called at once, and making a sound
2014-04-11 21:01:56	@J	yeah, so like I said, only choose from free spots
2014-04-11 21:01:59	@J	shouldn't be too hard
2014-04-11 21:02:15	@J	actually, I think I completely disabled the audio system
2014-04-11 21:02:18	@J	but I'll try that
2014-04-11 21:02:33	@Espyo	well, if you did that...
2014-04-11 21:02:36	@Espyo	wait, how, exactly?
2014-04-11 21:02:38	@Espyo	(the audio system)
2014-04-11 21:03:26	@Espyo	I hope I didn't mess up the code
2014-04-11 21:03:34	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard... right?
2014-04-11 21:03:39	@J	renaming the sound makes it segfault every time it tries to play it
2014-04-11 21:03:46	@Espyo	...
2014-04-11 21:03:48	@Espyo	it shouldn't
2014-04-11 21:03:52	@Espyo	gotta fix that
2014-04-11 21:04:55	@Espyo	guess it's working fine now
2014-04-11 21:05:22	@J	okay, I'm actually not sure what I did
2014-04-11 21:05:32	@J	I commented out
2014-04-11 21:05:33	@J	al_attach_mixer_to_voice(mixer, voice);
2014-04-11 21:05:39	@J	because it was causing a segfault
2014-04-11 21:05:48	@Espyo	that's a thing you could've done to stop the audio, I guess
2014-04-11 21:06:31	@Espyo	but yeah, adding "if(!sample || !instance) return;" to the start of misc_structs.cpp's void sample_struct::play should stop it from crashing
2014-04-11 21:06:38	@Espyo	I added, but didn't test it, gotta grab dinner
2014-04-11 21:12:39	@J	doesn't help with the lag
2014-04-11 21:17:11	@J	yeah...WTF
2014-04-11 21:17:21	@J	one time, it's taking 35597479 5
2014-04-11 21:17:23	@J	...
2014-04-11 21:17:39	@J	one time, it's taking 35597479 attempts to find a spot when choosing from only 5
2014-04-11 21:18:12	@J	it always happens when there's one spot left
2014-04-11 21:18:19	@J	except for the innermost ring
2014-04-11 21:18:40	@J	.............oh
2014-04-11 21:18:43	@J	because you're crazy
2014-04-11 21:19:02	@J	maybe random() is returning floats
2014-04-11 21:19:27	@J	so you only get the upper bound when the number is so close to it that casting to int gives you it
2014-04-11 21:20:50	@J	yep
2014-04-11 21:21:29	@J	so, I don't know where random is meant to come from
2014-04-11 21:21:41	@J	you never #include anything with it, AFAICT
2014-04-11 21:26:47	@Espyo	r-random is returning floats
2014-04-11 21:26:52	@Espyo	...don't hit me ;_;
2014-04-11 21:26:52	@J	yeah
2014-04-11 21:26:57	@Espyo	blame C++, will you
2014-04-11 21:27:02	@J	I don't even know what random is meant to be
2014-04-11 21:27:12	@Espyo	returns a random float in the range [a, b]
2014-04-11 21:27:15	@Espyo	inclusive
2014-04-11 21:27:20	@J	defined by what standard?
2014-04-11 21:27:28	@Espyo	or at least it did, back when random() returned integers
2014-04-11 21:27:32	@Espyo	defined by the Espyo standard
2014-04-11 21:27:34	@J	...
2014-04-11 21:27:35	@Espyo	I made that function
2014-04-11 21:27:38	@J	where?
2014-04-11 21:27:42	@J	I see no definition
2014-04-11 21:27:46	@Espyo	no?
2014-04-11 21:27:48	@J	no
2014-04-11 21:27:51	@Espyo	hm, must be a preprocessor define
2014-04-11 21:28:15	@J	oh, found it
2014-04-11 21:28:25	@J	wait, so how is this not affecting you?
2014-04-11 21:28:49	@Espyo	https://github.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine/blob/master/Source/functions.cpp#L1607
2014-04-11 21:28:57	@Espyo	good question...
2014-04-11 21:29:13	@Espyo	I actually did create a randomi and randomf for Testyo
2014-04-11 21:29:19	@Espyo	so at least he won't be affected by the same
2014-04-11 21:29:25	@Espyo	but I never got around to it for the engine
2014-04-11 21:31:33	@Espyo	...or maybe I didn't
2014-04-11 21:31:42	@Espyo	huh, I'm sure I created a randomf and randomi somewhere...
2014-04-11 21:32:04	@Espyo	oh, it's on the stream intermission thing
2014-04-11 21:38:56	@Espyo	J: is your machine 64-bit?
2014-04-11 21:41:42	Spark	hey espy quick question, how do you have optional parameters for a function of a class
2014-04-11 21:42:52	@Espyo	whether it's a function in a class or not, just add "=<default value>" after the name
2014-04-11 21:43:05	@Espyo	like split(string delimiter=" ")
2014-04-11 21:43:15	@Espyo	are you using both .h and .cpp files?
2014-04-11 21:43:19	@Espyo	(or .hpp if that's your thing)
2014-04-11 21:43:58	Spark	yeah hpp
2014-04-11 21:44:29	Spark	when i try doing that it says C:\Users\Nicholas\Desktop\WORKSPACE\Dungeon Crawler\main.cpp|36|error: no matching function for call to 'Player::relativeReposition(int, int)'|
2014-04-11 21:44:43	@Espyo	in that case, only add the =<stuff> in the .hpp
2014-04-11 21:44:49	@Espyo	if you do it in the .cpp it'll just go berserk
2014-04-11 21:44:54	@Espyo	but that error's kind of weird
2014-04-11 21:45:08	Spark	in the hpp?
2014-04-11 21:45:13	Spark	but the variables are defined in the cpp
2014-04-11 21:45:20	Spark	like void Player::relativeReposition(float x, float y, bool uhb=true)
2014-04-11 21:45:28	Spark	in the hpp its just         void relativeReposition(float, float, bool);
2014-04-11 21:45:32	@Espyo	yes
2014-04-11 21:45:39	@Espyo	in the hpp is where the =true should be
2014-04-11 21:45:46	@Espyo	hmm
2014-04-11 21:45:49	@Espyo	not sure if you can do bool=true
2014-04-11 21:45:59	@Espyo	to be frank, I name them both in the .h(pp) and the .cpp
2014-04-11 21:46:11	Spark	oh
2014-04-11 21:46:16	Spark	does it make a difference, even?
2014-04-11 21:46:19	@Espyo	nope
2014-04-11 21:46:35	@Espyo	but I'm saying because I'm not sure if you'll need to have, in the .hpp, "bool uhb=true" or just "bool=true"
2014-04-11 21:46:42	@Espyo	try the latter, and if it complains, the former
