2015-10-05 21:41:09	ScruffyChat	It could be a tree
2015-10-05 21:41:20	ScruffyChat	A fruiting tree that fruits Onions
2015-10-05 21:41:26	En_Passant	That's... genius.
2015-10-05 21:41:44	ScruffyChat	And the boss would be a parasite infested in the roots or somehow living off the tree
2015-10-05 21:42:17	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-05 21:42:36	En_Passant	What about Candypop Buds?
2015-10-05 21:42:40	Drigibug313	What are you guys talking about?
2015-10-05 21:42:50	En_Passant	The ending to Scruffy's game
2015-10-05 21:42:54	En_Passant	Spoiler alert
2015-10-05 21:42:57	Drigibug313	Ah
2015-10-05 21:43:00	ScruffyChat	I had to rethink the whole thing
2015-10-05 21:43:09	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akvOtEUM9cY
2015-10-05 21:43:14	ScruffyChat	Nice to meet you, Drigibug313!
2015-10-05 21:43:40	Drigibug313	You too! Your renders are amazing, by the way
2015-10-05 21:44:14	ScruffyChat	Thank you. I'm very far below the community of artists out there, though
2015-10-05 21:44:22	ScruffyChat	You should look up the Blender Artists website
2015-10-05 21:45:15	ScruffyChat	Well, also En_Passant, I wanted to know if this was going too far with the "Onions=fruit" thing
2015-10-05 21:45:19	@Espyo	oops, meant to post in a different channel
2015-10-05 21:45:21	@Espyo	still good though
2015-10-05 21:45:22	En_Passant	No, not at all
2015-10-05 21:45:27	Drigibug313	Will do
2015-10-05 21:45:27	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-05 21:45:32	ScruffyChat	Great
2015-10-05 21:45:39	ScruffyChat	Well, I thought since Onions are fruit
2015-10-05 21:45:46	ScruffyChat	And fruit produce seeds
2015-10-05 21:45:51	ScruffyChat	And Pikmin begin as seeds
2015-10-05 21:46:00	ScruffyChat	Then some day Pikmin are meant to become these trees
2015-10-05 21:46:09	ScruffyChat	And they can't because they are plucked by leaders
2015-10-05 21:46:24	Drigibug313	Are Candypop Buds evolved from Pikmin, ten?
2015-10-05 21:46:36	Drigibug313	*then
2015-10-05 21:46:39	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure how to work in Candypop buds yet
2015-10-05 21:47:14	En_Passant	I'm not sure that the Pikmin themselves ought to be the tree candidates
2015-10-05 21:47:26	En_Passant	Just because Pikmin are often planted together
2015-10-05 21:47:31	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-05 21:47:39	ScruffyChat	And if left in the ground too long they revert to leaves
2015-10-05 21:47:48	ScruffyChat	I was worried about that
2015-10-05 21:47:51	En_Passant	They actually removed that in P3
2015-10-05 21:47:56	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-05 21:48:29	Drigibug313	They did?
2015-10-05 21:48:47	En_Passant	Yeah, they removed all forms of losing maturity
2015-10-05 21:49:27	Drigibug313	It was a lot harder to get nectar in that game though, compared to P2
2015-10-05 21:49:35	ScruffyChat	That's the balancer
2015-10-05 21:50:02	ScruffyChat	So the only thing I don't know is where this tree would have come from
2015-10-05 21:51:50	ScruffyChat	I had thought that Pikmin could be part-animal so that they could find the best spot to take root and grow
2015-10-05 21:52:02	ScruffyChat	But that doesn't happen, Pikmin have to be plucked to move around
2015-10-05 21:52:14	En_Passant	I'd make the Onions the ones that become trees
2015-10-05 21:52:24	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-05 21:52:33	En_Passant	Similar to the moon idea, but better
2015-10-05 21:52:40	En_Passant	It could also tie into the Master Onion concept
2015-10-05 21:52:57	ScruffyChat	True!
2015-10-05 21:53:12	En_Passant	Actually, it could tie into a lot of things
2015-10-05 21:53:28	En_Passant	Maybe it needs a certain amount of Pikmin to start growing
2015-10-05 21:53:53	Drigibug313	Hmm, would it tie in to the onions at the end of P1?
2015-10-05 21:54:19	En_Passant	I guess. A similar fleet appears in PF (Scruffy's game)
2015-10-05 21:54:32	ScruffyChat	Right, there's a cloud of them that guard the tree
2015-10-05 21:54:52	En_Passant	Anyway, it would explain why they collect things for it, are stored inside it, and have a limit to how many can be outside it at a time.
2015-10-05 21:55:02	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-10-05 21:55:17	ScruffyChat	It should be that it needs an amount of Pikmin to become a tree
2015-10-05 21:55:41	ScruffyChat	But that'd still mean that Onions need a leader to guide Pikmin
2015-10-05 21:55:50	ScruffyChat	Although that's less outrageous
2015-10-05 21:55:58	ScruffyChat	Trees use animals to spread seeds all the time
2015-10-05 21:56:07	ScruffyChat	In fact, that's why fruit is sweet
2015-10-05 21:56:30	En_Passant	I mean, maybe at one point the Onions were smart enough to do it
2015-10-05 21:56:36	En_Passant	They've gotten really stupid by P3
2015-10-05 21:56:40	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-05 21:56:50	Drigibug313	Could they be using the Bulbmin for that purpose?
2015-10-05 21:57:01	ScruffyChat	Well, they've gotten spoiled off Olimar's leadership I guess
2015-10-05 21:57:19	En_Passant	Anyway, I need to leave school and go home. Will be back in 15-ish minutes
2015-10-05 21:57:25	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-05 21:57:35	ScruffyChat	I'm so glad you've led me on this path, by the way
2015-10-05 21:57:37	ScruffyChat	Thank you so much

2015-10-05 22:32:43	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-05 22:33:14	ScruffyChat	I'll still like the idea of battling it underground
2015-10-05 22:33:26	ScruffyChat	An idyllic sunlit tree doesn't seem like the place for a final battle
2015-10-05 22:35:00	ScruffyChat	Anyway I'll think of something

2015-10-05 22:37:34	ScruffyChat	I've completely rewritten the ending to PF
2015-10-05 22:37:36	@PikFan	first thing I see is "porn" splattered all over my screen
2015-10-05 22:37:44	@PikFan	oh, really? neat
2015-10-05 22:37:45	En_Passant	Does that turn you on
2015-10-05 22:38:02	@PikFan	...uh
2015-10-05 22:38:02	En_Passant	... I'll stop
2015-10-05 22:38:07	@PikFan	good call...
2015-10-05 22:38:12	ScruffyChat	Well...
2015-10-05 22:38:19	ScruffyChat	...instead of Onion moons
2015-10-05 22:38:19	@PikFan	ANYWAY
2015-10-05 22:38:28	ScruffyChat	There's now a big tree
2015-10-05 22:38:31	ScruffyChat	A tree that fruits Onions
2015-10-05 22:38:40	@PikFan	ooh, interesting
2015-10-05 22:38:41	ScruffyChat	That's what the Onions in the sky are guarding
2015-10-05 22:38:57	@PikFan	that is certainly more plausible
2015-10-05 22:39:01	ScruffyChat	And once one Onion has enough Pikmin seeds, it can become such a tree
2015-10-05 22:39:09	@PikFan	oh, this remindsme
2015-10-05 22:39:12	@PikFan	*reminds me
2015-10-05 22:39:27	@PikFan	I was thinking that some Pikmin types might not start off with an Onion
2015-10-05 22:39:42	@PikFan	but you can make an Onion if you choose to sacrifice x amount of Pikmin for it
2015-10-05 22:40:18	En_Passant	So, confirming that Candypop Buds turn into Onions, then
2015-10-05 22:40:39	@PikFan	there was a schematic somewhere I saw about this
2015-10-05 22:41:35	ScruffyChat	That's an interesting choice
2015-10-05 22:41:49	@PikFan	[[f:Onion Seed]]
2015-10-05 22:41:49	Testyo	"Onion_Seed" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Onion_Seed
2015-10-05 22:42:09	@PikFan	it's super old, but I was thinking of renewing it so it fits into my newer game
2015-10-05 22:42:28	@PikFan	so you just sacrifice Pikmin of the same type to it, which energizes it
2015-10-05 22:42:34	@PikFan	and an Onion is created
2015-10-05 22:42:50	@PikFan	...well,no
2015-10-05 22:42:53	@PikFan	*well, no
2015-10-05 22:43:11	@PikFan	after the seed is energized, the Master Onion would absorb it
2015-10-05 22:44:21	ScruffyChat	So a White Onion could only be energized with White Pikmin?
2015-10-05 22:44:29	@PikFan	right
2015-10-05 22:44:39	@PikFan	a White Onion Seed, that is
2015-10-05 22:44:50	ScruffyChat	right
2015-10-05 22:45:04	ScruffyChat	That is interesting
2015-10-05 22:45:41	ScruffyChat	And I guess the only reason you wouldn't do that is because there isn't enough time to grow all those pikmin?
2015-10-05 22:45:59	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-05 22:46:24	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-10-05 22:46:47	@PikFan	I'm not sure if sacrificing the Pikmin would count as deaths or not
2015-10-05 22:47:06	@PikFan	I mean, technically, they do die
2015-10-05 22:47:23	@PikFan	but still, it's not like they succumbed to a hazard or an enemy ate them
2015-10-05 22:47:38	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-05 22:47:46	ScruffyChat	I guess it could be a whole new parameter
2015-10-05 22:47:59	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-10-05 22:48:02	ScruffyChat	At the end of the game, it would tell you how many Onions you cultivated
2015-10-05 22:48:04	@PikFan	En_Passant: thoughts?
2015-10-05 22:48:11	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-10-05 22:48:15	En_Passant	How many Pikmin would you have to sacrifice?
2015-10-05 22:48:27	@PikFan	I don't know, but it'd be a fairly large number
2015-10-05 22:48:35	@PikFan	no more than 100, though
2015-10-05 22:49:13	En_Passant	Yes, and we run into the problem of opportunity cost
2015-10-05 22:49:35	@PikFan	well, I want players to choose
2015-10-05 22:49:52	En_Passant	If you can get this lot of Pikmin without an Onion, why throw them away to get one?
2015-10-05 22:49:55	@PikFan	either find Candypops, or just make an Onion
2015-10-05 22:50:11	@PikFan	because an Onion is more convenient for making Pikmin
2015-10-05 22:50:18	ScruffyChat	Well, true, En_Passant does have a point
2015-10-05 22:50:38	ScruffyChat	If it's difficult to find Purple Pikmin, then a player will be proud of getting 100
2015-10-05 22:50:50	En_Passant	That's not really what I meant
2015-10-05 22:50:51	ScruffyChat	And unwilling to give all those up for an Onion that can produce them again
2015-10-05 22:50:58	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-05 22:51:37	En_Passant	I'll amend my question: If you can get this lot of Pikmin without too much hassle
2015-10-05 22:52:09	@PikFan	oh, yes
2015-10-05 22:52:17	@PikFan	then you wouldn't need an Onion
2015-10-05 22:52:17	En_Passant	And if there is a lot of hassle, then you're either going to say "Screw it" if they're not that important

2015-10-05 22:56:21	ScruffyChat	Perhaps inactive Onions could be optional items to collect

2015-10-05 22:57:19	En_Passant	How many do you think there'll be?

2015-10-05 22:59:51	@PikFan	oh, MK8...
2015-10-05 23:00:09	@PikFan	I'd play MK8 more if it wasn't for those freaking OP Japanese people
2015-10-05 23:00:17	Drigibug313	Smash, MK8, Pikmin 3, Splatoon, Mario Maker
2015-10-05 23:00:34	Drigibug313	Splatoon is my jam currently
2015-10-05 23:00:37	@PikFan	I want Splatoon really bad
2015-10-05 23:00:49	ScruffyChat	You've gotta get Super Mario 3D World too
2015-10-05 23:00:58	Drigibug313	And yeah MK8 is definitely more fun with a friend or something
2015-10-05 23:00:59	@PikFan	but I'll probably get it at Christmastime
2015-10-05 23:01:16	Drigibug313	Oh yeah I have 3d world, forgot about that

2015-10-05 23:02:00	Drigibug313	I've never really been interested in the Zelda games
2015-10-05 23:02:13	@PikFan	that's too bad, I think they're great

2015-10-05 23:02:50	En_Passant	I stopped playing New Leaf once I got all the Golden Tools
2015-10-05 23:03:01	--	Pi is now known as Podgey
2015-10-05 23:03:09	@PikFan	golden watering can was super easy imo
2015-10-05 23:03:22	Drigibug313	I have no clue how mine isnt broken yet
2015-10-05 23:03:34	Drigibug313	I've dropped it like 50 times
2015-10-05 23:03:38	@PikFan	mine broke because I tore a cable somewhere
2015-10-05 23:03:47	@PikFan	...so I completely took it apart
2015-10-05 23:03:53	@PikFan	now it really is broken
2015-10-05 23:03:54	Drigibug313	ooooh

2015-10-05 23:04:19	@PikFan	I've been thinking about it
2015-10-05 23:04:19	Drigibug313	That one has Xenoblade
2015-10-05 23:04:23	@PikFan	but moneyyyyyyyyy
2015-10-05 23:04:29	Drigibug313	yah true
2015-10-05 23:04:43	@PikFan	and I'd rather get the normal sized N3DS
2015-10-05 23:05:00	Drigibug313	I haven't been buying games recently cuz no money
2015-10-05 23:05:03	@PikFan	XL is fine, but I want the smaller one so it fits into my pockets more easily
2015-10-05 23:05:11	Drigibug313	True true
2015-10-05 23:05:42	Drigibug313	I've been replaying a lot of older games
2015-10-05 23:05:52	@PikFan	I see

2015-10-05 23:07:21	Drigibug313	I'd say to go for it, college opens up a lot of things in your life
2015-10-05 23:07:36	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-05 23:07:48	Drigibug313	Especially work experience cuz they often offer internships
2015-10-05 23:07:49	@PikFan	also, this is random, but how old are you? I forgot

2015-10-05 23:09:29	@PikFan	close enough
2015-10-05 23:09:41	@PikFan	...mostly because I hardly went anywhere with it lol

2015-10-05 23:12:33	Drigibug313	It was like everyone just set aside their differences to be nice that day
2015-10-05 23:12:38	Drigibug313	And it was awesome
2015-10-05 23:13:53	Drigibug313	By the way, thinking up names for treasures in my game is pretty fun actually
2015-10-05 23:14:16	Drigibug313	I have to think like how Olimar would
2015-10-05 23:14:22	En_Passant	I agree
2015-10-05 23:14:39	@PikFan	I'm loving the names you're coming up with

2015-10-06 22:22:11	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-06 22:25:01	ScruffyChat	I was wondering if you could help me with a new final boss
2015-10-06 22:25:14	ScruffyChat	Since you helped so much with the LLL before it was changed
2015-10-06 22:25:26	ScruffyChat	Now I have a good setting for the boss battle, but no boss yet
2015-10-06 22:25:34	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-10-06 22:25:45	ScruffyChat	Whatever it is, it has to live parasitically off the Onion tree
2015-10-06 22:25:56	@PikFan	right
2015-10-06 22:26:45	@PikFan	I don't have any ideas...
2015-10-06 22:26:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it's tricky
2015-10-06 22:27:10	ScruffyChat	I was thinking some sort of worm, but there are a lot of worm enemies
2015-10-06 22:27:18	ScruffyChat	Well, sort of
2015-10-06 22:27:52	ScruffyChat	Ooh I just thought of something
2015-10-06 22:28:02	ScruffyChat	It'd be some sort of Snavian maybe
2015-10-06 22:28:18	ScruffyChat	based off of a worm and an owl? perhaps
2015-10-06 22:28:28	ScruffyChat	Now that I think about it it sounds kind of dumb
2015-10-06 22:28:33	ScruffyChat	Or at least not final boss material
2015-10-06 22:28:45	@PikFan	I agree that it should be a Snavian
2015-10-06 22:28:57	@PikFan	Snavians are among the most recognized enemies in the games
2015-10-06 22:29:22	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-06 22:29:57	@PikFan	hmm, it's interesting, because in the fanfiction I'm writing, the characters have to battle a Tree Snagret, which lives in, well, a tree
2015-10-06 22:30:23	ScruffyChat	Is that Mysterious World?
2015-10-06 22:31:08	@PikFan	yep
2015-10-06 22:31:15	@PikFan	why, have you read it?
2015-10-06 22:31:23	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-10-06 22:31:26	ScruffyChat	It's really good

2015-10-06 22:31:34	ScruffyChat	Very good character writing
2015-10-06 22:31:48	@PikFan	I'm trying to make them all distinct
2015-10-06 22:31:48	ScruffyChat	And I really like the way you designed the Onions holding a really big space inside them
2015-10-06 22:31:54	@PikFan	oh, yes
2015-10-06 22:31:59	@PikFan	the Onions were fun to envision
2015-10-06 22:32:16	ScruffyChat	I can just imagine a movie panning around the bustling Red Onion
2015-10-06 22:32:40	@PikFan	I originally wanted to make them way more technological (like holograms and such), but I decided it'd be simpler if it just had technology like ours
2015-10-06 22:32:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-06 22:33:23	@PikFan	but yeah, Exploration was a fun chapter to write
2015-10-06 22:33:31	@PikFan	...even though it took 5 months to do :|
2015-10-06 22:33:49	@PikFan	I had so many conflicting ideas
2015-10-06 22:33:49	ScruffyChat	Fun chapter to read as well 
2015-10-06 22:33:55	ScruffyChat	Wow 5 months
2015-10-06 22:34:02	@PikFan	I hope the structure wasn't too complicated to understand
2015-10-06 22:34:04	ScruffyChat	That's dedicated
2015-10-06 22:34:08	ScruffyChat	no no
2015-10-06 22:34:12	@PikFan	oh, that's good
2015-10-06 22:34:35	@PikFan	but yeah, I originally wanted Ruby to be a secret villain
2015-10-06 22:34:54	ScruffyChat	ooh
2015-10-06 22:35:15	@PikFan	but I decided screw it, somebody else will be a villain
2015-10-06 22:35:20	ScruffyChat	I love how the Pikmin organize themselves
2015-10-06 22:35:28	ScruffyChat	like with Sprout Facility and all
2015-10-06 22:35:28	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-10-06 22:35:46	@PikFan	after 3 visits, they should be able to organize themselves by now, I think
2015-10-06 22:36:10	ScruffyChat	Yeah

2015-10-06 22:36:26	@PikFan	anyway, so what were we saying about the final boss?
2015-10-06 22:36:56	ScruffyChat	So, just to clarify, can Pikmin understand or communicate with animals in any way?
2015-10-06 22:37:28	ScruffyChat	Because I think the enemies of the series could make some really interesting characters
2015-10-06 22:37:49	@PikFan	good idea
2015-10-06 22:37:52	ScruffyChat	If they could express themselves
2015-10-06 22:38:15	@PikFan	I think most of them wouldn't be intelligent enough
2015-10-06 22:38:27	@PikFan	but there would be certain leaders of enemies that could speak, yes
2015-10-06 22:38:44	@PikFan	or rather, most of them wouldn't speak the Pikmin language
2015-10-06 22:38:53	ScruffyChat	I made a series of short fictional stories (in the form of podcast transcripts) where this lab connected a device to animals that allowed them to process thoughts and speak them in English
2015-10-06 22:39:03	ScruffyChat	And they talked about what they learned of human kind
2015-10-06 22:39:12	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-06 22:39:17	ScruffyChat	And I have to say, writing animal dialogue is more fun than writing human
2015-10-06 22:39:17	@PikFan	kinda like Up?
2015-10-06 22:39:28	@PikFan	if you've watched Up
2015-10-06 22:39:32	ScruffyChat	Yes, but more intelligible
2015-10-06 22:39:38	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-06 22:39:42	ScruffyChat	The English is more advanced
2015-10-06 22:39:49	ScruffyChat	And the subjects are a bit more mature
2015-10-06 22:39:59	ScruffyChat	As in human rights and things like that
2015-10-06 22:40:08	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-06 22:40:41	@PikFan	this reminds me, we started reading a book in English class yesterday, and it's a dystopian novel where books are banned and burned
2015-10-06 22:40:52	ScruffyChat	Don't tell me
2015-10-06 22:40:57	ScruffyChat	Fahrenheit 451?
2015-10-06 22:41:01	@PikFan	that's the one
2015-10-06 22:41:07	ScruffyChat	Yes, I love that book
2015-10-06 22:41:38	@PikFan	I think I will too
2015-10-06 22:41:42	ScruffyChat	There are science fictions that really hit the mark, and seem way ahead of their time
2015-10-06 22:41:49	ScruffyChat	And that book is definitely one of them
2015-10-06 22:41:53	@PikFan	I'm already liking the themes it's portraying
2015-10-06 22:41:59	ScruffyChat	I won't spoil it though
2015-10-06 22:42:07	@PikFan	thamnks
2015-10-06 22:42:09	@PikFan	*thanks
2015-10-06 22:42:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-06 22:42:39	ScruffyChat	So are you currently writing the encounter with the Tree Snagret?
2015-10-06 22:42:48	@PikFan	trying to...
2015-10-06 22:43:02	@PikFan	really, I'm just being lazy
2015-10-06 22:43:08	ScruffyChat	Ah no problem
2015-10-06 22:43:20	ScruffyChat	That's a valid excuse for a writer
2015-10-06 22:43:30	@PikFan	I suppose
2015-10-06 22:43:46	ScruffyChat	Ideas sometimes can't come to you unless you slow down and be lazy
2015-10-06 22:44:09	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-06 22:44:17	@PikFan	anyway, I've got big plans for MW
2015-10-06 22:44:30	ScruffyChat	Cool! I'm excited for it
2015-10-06 22:44:34	@PikFan	these Pikmin who are in the Awakening Wood, they haven't met Rock and Winged Pikmin
2015-10-06 22:44:44	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-06 22:44:54	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing they act like different tribes?
2015-10-06 22:45:05	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-06 22:45:17	@PikFan	their Onions would be more advanced, I'm thinking
2015-10-06 22:45:23	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-06 22:45:33	ScruffyChat	Because they came later and are more esoteric
2015-10-06 22:45:37	@PikFan	yes
2015-10-06 22:45:43	ScruffyChat	By the way, can anyone write a story?
2015-10-06 22:46:05	@PikFan	is this a rhetorical question...?
2015-10-06 22:46:08	@PikFan	oh, wait
2015-10-06 22:46:12	@PikFan	you meant on the Story Serial

2015-10-06 22:46:20	ScruffyChat	No no I meant in general
2015-10-06 22:46:25	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-06 22:46:28	ScruffyChat	on Pikmin fanon
2015-10-06 22:46:33	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-06 22:46:34	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-06 22:46:41	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-06 22:46:47	@PikFan	Fanon isn't strictly about games
2015-10-06 22:46:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-06 22:47:15	@PikFan	so if you want to write a story, you're more than welcome to
2015-10-06 22:47:16	ScruffyChat	Well cool, maybe I could write something sometime
2015-10-06 22:47:21	@PikFan	go for it
2015-10-06 22:47:22	ScruffyChat	I love writing short stories
2015-10-06 22:47:26	ScruffyChat	About anything but humans
2015-10-06 22:47:36	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-06 22:47:44	ScruffyChat	Because everything else makes better characterts
2015-10-06 22:47:49	@PikFan	indeed
2015-10-06 22:48:20	ScruffyChat	For instance, I for one would much rather read a story in which two balls of yarn argue than one in which two people argue
2015-10-06 22:49:01	@PikFan	how fascinating
2015-10-06 22:49:14	@PikFan	and then they start attacking each other with tendrils of yarn
2015-10-06 22:49:15	ScruffyChat	Oh, I've gotta go
2015-10-06 22:49:19	ScruffyChat	haha yeah
2015-10-06 22:49:23	ScruffyChat	see ya
2015-10-06 22:49:23	@PikFan	oh, okay

2015-10-06 22:54:37	@PikFan	we think it'll be a Snavian of sorts, since Snavians are among the most recognized enemies in the series

2015-10-07 22:36:23	@PikFan	hello
2015-10-07 22:41:04	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-07 22:41:35	@PikFan	so, I often find myself designing areas to preexisting video game music
2015-10-07 22:41:50	@PikFan	that fits the theme of the area
2015-10-07 22:42:05	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2015-10-07 22:42:06	@PikFan	that's not weird... is it?
2015-10-07 22:42:13	ScruffyChat	No not at all
2015-10-07 22:42:21	@PikFan	ah, okay
2015-10-07 22:42:30	ScruffyChat	What's an example?
2015-10-07 22:43:10	@PikFan	like, on the [[f:Rugged Tundra]], I can imagine this playing: https://www.youtu.be.com/ZD3nVSSJ_So

2015-10-07 22:43:42	@PikFan	...I can never figure out how to post YT links without a video appearing in the chat
2015-10-07 22:44:04	@PikFan	anyway, this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD3nVSSJ_So
2015-10-07 22:45:25	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-07 22:45:42	ScruffyChat	It certainly has an icy feel to it
2015-10-07 22:45:46	@PikFan	indeed
2015-10-07 22:46:00	@PikFan	it captures that sense of cold desolation
2015-10-07 22:46:27	ScruffyChat	Yes yes
2015-10-07 22:46:52	@PikFan	that game's soundtrack is pretty amazing, I think
2015-10-07 22:49:02	ScruffyChat	This is really interesting
2015-10-07 22:49:09	ScruffyChat	I'm just running through the tracks
2015-10-07 22:49:26	ScruffyChat	The composition is very high-quality
2015-10-07 22:49:58	@PikFan	right

2015-10-07 22:54:10	@PikFan	anyway, as you were saying?
2015-10-07 22:54:23	ScruffyChat	Oh, just I admired the composition
2015-10-07 22:54:29	@PikFan	ah, yes
2015-10-07 22:54:53	ScruffyChat	A lot of really intriguing textures
2015-10-07 22:55:06	ScruffyChat	It does seem like I could play Pikmin to it
2015-10-07 22:55:16	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-07 22:55:36	@PikFan	I can imagine this theme playing while you explore the Distant Desert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzhWK0U4H3k

2015-10-07 22:55:48	@PikFan	oh, right, I renamed that to the Torrid Desert
2015-10-07 22:56:49	@PikFan	there's even a night theme, too
2015-10-07 22:57:00	ScruffyChat	Oh nice
2015-10-07 22:57:07	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WixgMv1qyDg
2015-10-07 22:57:25	ScruffyChat	I love the didgeridoo
2015-10-07 22:57:42	@PikFan	what instrument is that?
2015-10-07 22:57:56	ScruffyChat	The didgeridoo?
2015-10-07 22:58:00	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-07 22:58:23	ScruffyChat	It's a huge tube you buzz your lips into
2015-10-07 22:58:30	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-07 22:58:41	ScruffyChat	It can be really low and buzzy, or you can articulate singing with it and bring out interesting harmonics
2015-10-07 22:58:49	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-07 22:58:54	ScruffyChat	It's an Aboriginal instrument of Australia
2015-10-07 22:59:00	@PikFan	just looked it up and wow it is huge

2015-10-07 22:59:26	ScruffyChat	It had to be, the sound had to carry because the Aborigines used it for long-distance communication
2015-10-07 22:59:35	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-07 22:59:43	@PikFan	but yeah, I like the game's music a lot
2015-10-07 22:59:49	@PikFan	it's so...
2015-10-07 22:59:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-07 22:59:55	@PikFan	picturesque
2015-10-07 23:00:22	ScruffyChat	Indeed, if music were pictures
2015-10-07 23:00:36	ScruffyChat	What would you say is your favorite video game soundtrack?
2015-10-07 23:00:56	@PikFan	that one, tied with others from the same series
2015-10-07 23:01:16	@PikFan	they have some pretty impressive soundtracks
2015-10-07 23:01:55	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-07 23:05:11	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-07 23:05:34	@PikFan	"Torrid Desert" sounds better than "Distant Desert", but it still feels really bland
2015-10-07 23:07:30	ScruffyChat	I thought of Desolate Desert a few years back
2015-10-07 23:07:34	ScruffyChat	You can use that if you want

2015-10-08 20:50:22	@Espyo	that's not valid CSS
2015-10-08 20:50:25	@Espyo	hell is this nonsense
2015-10-08 20:50:41	@PikFan	he created three other pages like that
2015-10-08 20:51:11	@PikFan	monobook.js, vector.css, vector.js
2015-10-08 20:51:19	@PikFan	all with the same image

2015-10-08 20:54:24	@PikFan	this is such an idiotic article http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/10/07/are-star-fox-zero-the-legend-of-zelda-moving-from-the-wii-u-to-the-nx-3578934?lt_source=external,manual
2015-10-08 20:54:37	@PikFan	Miyamoto said that Star Fox would launch in Q1 2016
2015-10-08 20:54:58	@PikFan	why are these crackheads saying otherwise
2015-10-08 20:55:19	@Espyo	because sensationalism sells
2015-10-08 20:56:04	@PikFan	so clickbaity
2015-10-08 20:56:17	ScruffyChat	hi
2015-10-08 20:56:24	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-08 20:57:27	ScruffyChat	I was wondering, does the Shaggy Long Legs shiver because it's cold? Or because it's weakened
2015-10-08 20:57:49	@PikFan	latter, I think
2015-10-08 20:59:07	ScruffyChat	okay
2015-10-08 21:01:03	@PikFan	also, I still have no ideas for a new final boss for PF
2015-10-08 21:01:11	@PikFan	other than it'll be a Snagret of sorts
2015-10-08 21:01:40	Yoshi2	Espyo: huzzah, I managed to parse one of the files I couldn't parse yet
2015-10-08 21:02:21	Yoshi2	the result is a 27 minutes long midi because I'm just writing all music data into a single track
2015-10-08 21:02:48	Yoshi2	so theoretically, all sounds from the track should be somewhere in this midi file
2015-10-08 21:03:17	@Espyo	well, the Baldy doesn't shiver
2015-10-08 21:03:19	@Espyo	so the former IMO
2015-10-08 21:03:28	@Espyo	Yoshi2: sweet
2015-10-08 21:03:31	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2015-10-08 21:03:41	@PikFan	it shivers when shaking Pikmin off
2015-10-08 21:06:10	@PikFan	also: I had an idea last night to combine the Torrid Desert and Ancient Valley into just one area, since both are rocky areas
2015-10-08 21:06:22	@PikFan	it would be... the Torrid Valley
2015-10-08 21:10:14	@PikFan	alright, gotta go
2015-10-08 21:10:14	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah

2015-10-08 21:10:39	@PikFan	what are you saying "Oh yeah" to?
2015-10-08 21:10:55	ScruffyChat	To combine the areas
2015-10-08 21:10:58	ScruffyChat	good idea
2015-10-08 21:11:04	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-08 21:11:17	@PikFan	and yeah, though that means one area will have two types
2015-10-08 21:11:22	@PikFan	eh, Garden of Hope did too

2015-10-08 21:17:43	Yoshi2	but I'm not that familiar with pikmin 2 music
2015-10-08 21:23:47	@Espyo	shiver, not shaking
2015-10-08 21:23:50	@Espyo	shaking, all arachnorbs do
2015-10-08 21:23:55	@Espyo	but shiver only the shaggy, right?
2015-10-08 21:24:09	ScruffyChat	Right

2015-10-08 21:42:45	Yoshi2	and kinda play it
2015-10-08 21:43:04	Yoshi2	still need to figure out how to play them correctly though
2015-10-08 21:43:13	Yoshi2	and the cave music is still out of reach

2015-10-09 19:53:04	ScruffyChat	Thank you for fixing it
2015-10-09 19:53:10	@Espyo	no worries
2015-10-09 19:53:25	@Espyo	you might've opened the edit page before we went back-and-forth on our replies
2015-10-09 19:53:31	@Espyo	and when you saved, you saved with what existed before
2015-10-09 19:53:36	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-09 19:54:37	@J	should normally tell you there's a conflict when you do that though
2015-10-09 19:54:52	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-09 19:54:58	ScruffyChat	That's why it was confusing
2015-10-09 19:55:05	ScruffyChat	It acted like there was nothing wrong
2015-10-09 19:55:20	ScruffyChat	I think I probably edited a previous version of the article
2015-10-09 19:55:25	@J	Yoshi2: hmm, I find batch conversion is a weird thing to put in a program, usually
2015-10-09 19:55:32	@J	since it's so easy to script it
2015-10-09 19:56:11	Yoshi2	J: it would be easy to script it if I created a proper command line interface for the program
2015-10-09 19:56:20	@J	oh, it's a GUI or something?
2015-10-09 19:56:24	Yoshi2	I'm a lazy person though and 
2015-10-09 19:56:26	Yoshi2	god no
2015-10-09 19:57:01	Yoshi2	currently, you have to modify the source code to convert a different file
2015-10-09 19:57:14	@J	oh...
2015-10-09 19:57:25	@J	it should read a file from stdin and write it to stdout
2015-10-09 19:57:28	@J	like cat
2015-10-09 19:58:20	Yoshi2	so yes, I'm a lazy person and a proper CLI doesn't have a high priority for me
2015-10-09 19:59:08	@J	I guess if you're usually testing one file for a long time it's not more work to do it that way
2015-10-09 19:59:51	Yoshi2	I'm testing the stuff in my IDE so having it that way is easier

2015-10-09 21:47:33	En_Passant	hi
2015-10-09 21:48:11	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant
2015-10-09 21:48:31	En_Passant	I figured out one of the names for the areas in Polar Mountain
2015-10-09 21:48:47	En_Passant	Snow Cliffs is now Shimmering Ridge
2015-10-09 21:49:00	@PikFan	nice
2015-10-09 21:49:01	En_Passant	Still don't know what to do with the other one, though
2015-10-09 21:49:14	@PikFan	what's the other one about?
2015-10-09 21:49:48	@PikFan	the White-Out Zone?
2015-10-09 21:49:53	En_Passant	Yes
2015-10-09 21:50:12	En_Passant	I'm implemented weather that obsoletes its gimmick, though
2015-10-09 21:50:19	En_Passant	*implementing
2015-10-09 21:50:42	En_Passant	Once I figure out this area name and my upgrades I'm going to make a big update to the page
2015-10-09 21:50:54	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-09 21:51:02	En_Passant	{{f:Pikmin V}}
2015-10-09 21:51:02	Testyo	"Pikmin_V" template = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:Pikmin_V
2015-10-09 21:51:12	En_Passant	... oh
2015-10-09 21:51:18	En_Passant	The f: works on anything
2015-10-09 21:51:25	En_Passant	[[f:Pikmin V]]
2015-10-09 21:51:25	Testyo	"Pikmin_V" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_V
2015-10-09 21:51:45	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-09 21:52:21	En_Passant	What I'm thinking of doing is connecting Strategy Move and sprays to Alph and Brittany, respectfully
2015-10-09 21:53:11	En_Passant	As well as making the first region boss not in the cave, opening that up for an upgrade
2015-10-09 21:53:38	En_Passant	And lastly, I realized that they removed lying down in P3 because it's outclassed by Go Here
2015-10-09 21:53:46	En_Passant	So Regeneration might be going to
2015-10-09 21:54:07	En_Passant	... but now I need upgrades to fill their places
2015-10-09 21:56:43	En_Passant	I'm definitely splitting Reinforcement back to its three components, but that still leaves a slot and an input open
2015-10-09 21:57:15	ScruffyChat	Reinforcement?
2015-10-09 21:57:19	En_Passant	going home now, brb in 15-ish
2015-10-09 21:57:25	ScruffyChat	Oh oky
2015-10-09 21:57:36	En_Passant	It's detailed on the page
2015-10-09 21:57:36	@PikFan	see you soon
2015-10-09 21:59:30	@PikFan	it's a combination of Metal Suit Z, Anti-Electrifier, and Scorch Guard
2015-10-09 21:59:34	@PikFan	...I think
2015-10-09 21:59:45	ScruffyChat	Ah i see

2015-10-09 22:20:58	ScruffyChat	hi
2015-10-09 22:22:17	ScruffyChat	I realized, En_Passant, that you could have a ship-based healing system to replace lying down
2015-10-09 22:22:22	ScruffyChat	Like how it was in P1
2015-10-09 22:22:37	ScruffyChat	And that could be the upgrade
2015-10-09 22:23:39	En_Passant	I already have a spray that fully heals
2015-10-09 22:23:44	En_Passant	It would need to be gradual
2015-10-09 22:24:26	En_Passant	Also, I don't like the idea of free full heals because it encourages being reckless with the leaders
2015-10-09 22:26:05	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-09 22:26:58	ScruffyChat	I've been experimenting with the idea of requesting more time during one day
2015-10-09 22:27:02	ScruffyChat	As an upgrade
2015-10-09 22:27:30	ScruffyChat	In case you're bringing back an item and it's approaching the ship against the sunset clock
2015-10-09 22:27:39	En_Passant	Someone has a mechanic where you can choose to stay late in exchange for time the next day
2015-10-09 22:27:52	ScruffyChat	That's PikFan I think
2015-10-09 22:28:08	@PikFan	hmm?

2015-10-09 22:28:30	ScruffyChat	For me it's staying late at the cost of enemies becoming dangerously more active
2015-10-09 22:28:48	@PikFan	they also do that in my game, too
2015-10-09 22:28:53	En_Passant	Oh, lol
2015-10-09 22:28:57	En_Passant	Well, good idea

2015-10-09 22:40:56	@PikFan	alright
2015-10-09 22:49:22	En_Passant	I think what I'm going to do is have a sprinting upgrade replace lying down
2015-10-09 22:49:40	En_Passant	That way leaders can move quickly without being required to ditch their Pikmin
2015-10-09 22:49:56	En_Passant	I'm not sure where in the game to put it, though

2015-10-09 23:34:23	@PikFan	I really want SMM
2015-10-09 23:34:27	@PikFan	and Splatoon
2015-10-09 23:34:35	@PikFan	I'll probably get both at christmas
2015-10-09 23:34:38	Drigibug313	i'd suggest Splatoon first
2015-10-09 23:34:58	Drigibug313	SMM can be hit or miss sometimes
2015-10-09 23:35:09	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-09 23:35:25	Drigibug313	I've made like 29 courses lol
2015-10-09 23:35:55	@PikFan	hmm, why?
2015-10-09 23:36:10	Drigibug313	I love making things
2015-10-09 23:36:22	Drigibug313	People tend to not star hard levels tho
2015-10-09 23:36:53	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-09 23:37:07	@PikFan	have you heard of a user called Panga
2015-10-09 23:37:36	Drigibug313	Also I'm glad I included the Astral Beauty series in my treasure hoard, I thought it was a clever homage
2015-10-09 23:37:48	Drigibug313	PangeaPanga?

2015-10-10 00:06:50	ScruffyChat	Oh, PikFan, I wanted to tell you an idea I had about PF's final boss, since it's up in the air right no
2015-10-10 00:06:52	ScruffyChat	now*
2015-10-10 00:07:01	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-10 00:07:04	@PikFan	what is it?
2015-10-10 00:07:45	ScruffyChat	So, since the big Pikmin tree is formed by a Master Onion, there'd be Pikmin of all kinds going into the tree
2015-10-10 00:08:20	ScruffyChat	So, if a creature were living parasitically and somehow connected to the roots of the tree, it could gain abilities based on Pikmin types
2015-10-10 00:08:44	ScruffyChat	So whatever this boss is, it will be physically connected to the tree's roots
2015-10-10 00:09:17	ScruffyChat	I was thinking some sort of huge insect, but the Helmeted Iceweavil is a big insect and you fight it right before this boss
2015-10-10 00:09:35	ScruffyChat	So now it's only a matter of what sort of animal or plant or fungus it should be
2015-10-10 00:09:35	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-10 00:09:43	@PikFan	right
2015-10-10 00:12:00	ScruffyChat	I'll think of it eventually
2015-10-10 00:12:11	@PikFan	maybe a plant of sorts?
2015-10-10 00:12:38	@PikFan	I can't think of any animals that are parasitic towards plants
2015-10-10 00:13:50	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2015-10-10 00:14:09	ScruffyChat	I mean, a lot of spiders can be parasitic
2015-10-10 00:14:11	ScruffyChat	And worms
2015-10-10 00:14:19	ScruffyChat	And especially caterpillars
2015-10-10 00:14:28	@PikFan	oh, true
2015-10-10 00:14:37	ScruffyChat	Maybe a big caterpillar
2015-10-10 00:14:39	@PikFan	didn't we talk about worms at one point?
2015-10-10 00:14:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-10 00:14:52	ScruffyChat	It'd be odd to fight a giant worm
2015-10-10 00:14:59	ScruffyChat	it's a thin creatuer
2015-10-10 00:15:01	ScruffyChat	creature*
2015-10-10 00:15:31	ScruffyChat	But its shape is also very moldable
2015-10-10 00:16:00	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-10 00:18:47	@PikFan	also, I have a question about the Onion tree
2015-10-10 00:19:00	@PikFan	where would it be?
2015-10-10 00:21:16	ScruffyChat	I think at the same place, the summit of the mountain
2015-10-10 00:21:41	@PikFan	how big would this tree be?
2015-10-10 00:21:47	ScruffyChat	Although, that's a little outrageous
2015-10-10 00:21:54	ScruffyChat	Very big
2015-10-10 00:22:00	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-10 00:22:04	ScruffyChat	Not nearly as big as a full-size tree though
2015-10-10 00:22:10	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-10 00:22:24	@PikFan	so like, smaller than an oak tree?
2015-10-10 00:22:35	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-10 00:22:46	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-10 00:22:49	ScruffyChat	In fact, smaller than most trees
2015-10-10 00:22:55	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-10 00:23:37	@PikFan	but if it's at the summit of a mountain, and presumably the only tree in that area, wouldn't it be really obvious?
2015-10-10 00:23:52	ScruffyChat	yeah, I'm not sure what to do about that
2015-10-10 00:24:08	ScruffyChat	It has to be at the summit, or else even more of the plot is kaput
2015-10-10 00:24:39	@PikFan	wait, the summit of the Forbidding Precipice?
2015-10-10 00:24:51	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-10 00:24:56	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-10 00:25:12	@PikFan	so... are you removing the Canyon of Moonlight, then?
2015-10-10 00:25:19	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-10 00:25:23	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-10 00:25:35	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately no more Daylight, Moonlight connection since no more moons
2015-10-10 00:25:46	@PikFan	right
2015-10-10 00:26:11	@PikFan	hmm, there's a part of me that says that the tree should be its own area
2015-10-10 00:26:35	ScruffyChat	You mean like, the entire area is the tree?
2015-10-10 00:26:50	@PikFan	as in the tree and its immediate surroundings
2015-10-10 00:27:22	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-10 00:27:25	ScruffyChat	I agree
2015-10-10 00:27:28	@PikFan	I was thinking it could be on an island far off in the ocean
2015-10-10 00:27:33	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2015-10-10 00:27:41	@PikFan	what do you think?
2015-10-10 00:27:45	ScruffyChat	That could work
2015-10-10 00:27:58	ScruffyChat	But then there'd be no point in going up the mountainside...
2015-10-10 00:28:23	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-10-10 00:28:37	@PikFan	the mountainside consists of the puzzles leading up to the final boss battle
2015-10-10 00:29:01	ScruffyChat	Well, not really, i'd still like it to be the second-to-last area
2015-10-10 00:29:26	ScruffyChat	The Forbidding Precipice is the mountainside, and without it I don't know what will represent winter
2015-10-10 00:35:34	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-10 00:35:47	@PikFan	sorry, I was talking to my mom
2015-10-10 00:36:00	@PikFan	anyway, the Precipice can still be the winter area
2015-10-10 00:36:21	@PikFan	but it could be like P3, where the last area is seasonless
2015-10-10 00:36:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-10 00:36:52	ScruffyChat	That'd work nicely
2015-10-10 00:37:11	@PikFan	and also, there could be a mountain on the island, too
2015-10-10 00:37:15	@PikFan	just smaller
2015-10-10 00:37:24	ScruffyChat	Or there could be an island on the mountain
2015-10-10 00:37:29	@PikFan	but that brings in the problem of repetition
2015-10-10 00:37:34	@PikFan	oooh
2015-10-10 00:37:50	ScruffyChat	As in, mountain so large there's a body of water at the summit
2015-10-10 00:38:16	@PikFan	case in point: Crater Lake
2015-10-10 00:38:17	@PikFan	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake
2015-10-10 00:39:05	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-10 00:39:19	ScruffyChat	The Pikmin tree could be like the "Old Man of the Lake"
2015-10-10 00:39:33	ScruffyChat	Just out in the middle of it
2015-10-10 00:39:43	ScruffyChat	That's so neat
2015-10-10 00:40:45	@PikFan	wait, just floating out on the lake?
2015-10-10 00:40:50	@PikFan	but... how would it grow?
2015-10-10 00:40:58	@PikFan	the stump is cool, yes
2015-10-10 00:46:12	ScruffyChat	Oh, never mind, it's just the stump
2015-10-10 00:46:32	ScruffyChat	But the tree could certainly be on its own little island on the summit lake
2015-10-10 00:46:50	@PikFan	right
2015-10-10 00:47:07	ScruffyChat	Although I don't know why it'd be up there, maybe to get a lot of sunlight but otherwise it's not extremely hospitable for plants like the Pikmin
2015-10-10 00:47:25	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-10-10 00:47:36	@PikFan	well
2015-10-10 00:48:14	@PikFan	maybe they chose that spot because the tree would be isolated from external threats, while being close to land in case they need to leave, or something
2015-10-10 00:48:31	@PikFan	*isolated from ground-based threats
2015-10-10 00:51:32	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-10 00:57:29	@PikFan	as for the puzzles...
2015-10-10 00:57:44	@PikFan	how can we make it so that it's not just climbing a mountainside all over again?
2015-10-10 01:02:53	ScruffyChat	I was thinking this boss could have burrowed in the tree
2015-10-10 01:03:03	ScruffyChat	And built a cave of it you have to travel through
2015-10-10 01:03:29	@PikFan	so going into the root system of the tree?
2015-10-10 01:03:32	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-10 01:03:44	ScruffyChat	And inside the trunk, a bit hollowed out
2015-10-10 01:04:14	ScruffyChat	I feel it'll end up being a Snavian
2015-10-10 01:04:27	ScruffyChat	Some sort of bird that can live around trees
2015-10-10 01:05:04	ScruffyChat	In combo with a grub that can burrow in trees
2015-10-10 01:07:50	ScruffyChat	plus Snagrets have a great dangerous way of attacking
2015-10-10 01:07:56	ScruffyChat	fast and efficient
2015-10-10 01:08:46	@PikFan	so a chimera of sorts with a Snagret head and an arthropod body?
2015-10-10 01:08:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-10 01:09:04	ScruffyChat	Perhaps a woodpecker-esque head
2015-10-10 01:09:08	@PikFan	fascinating
2015-10-10 01:09:36	ScruffyChat	And then it's connected to the tree's roots, and can extrapolate abilities from it
2015-10-10 01:10:20	@PikFan	would it always be connected to the roots, or could it be independent of them?
2015-10-10 01:10:40	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2015-10-10 01:10:49	ScruffyChat	I feel like always being connected would make it creepier
2015-10-10 01:10:51	@PikFan	if it could be independent, it would allow for greater mobility
2015-10-10 01:10:56	@PikFan	hm, true
2015-10-10 01:10:56	ScruffyChat	But it would be harder for it to move around
2015-10-10 01:11:21	@PikFan	maybe part of the battle has it being connected to the roots
2015-10-10 01:11:33	@PikFan	then once you hurt it enough, it gets enraged, and leaves the rootd
2015-10-10 01:11:35	@PikFan	*roots
2015-10-10 01:11:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-10 01:11:57	@PikFan	occasionally still attaching to them, though
2015-10-10 01:12:11	ScruffyChat	But also if it's a Snagret it can get around by burrowing in the ground, so the roots might not get in the way after all
2015-10-10 01:12:30	@PikFan	good point
2015-10-10 01:12:56	@PikFan	how thin would it be, considering it has an insect body?
2015-10-10 01:13:15	@PikFan	I'm thinking that in order to burrow like Snagrets, it would have to retract its legs
2015-10-10 01:13:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-10 01:14:07	@PikFan	some insects can burrow, yes
2015-10-10 01:14:15	@PikFan	but Snagrets travel very quickly underground
2015-10-10 01:14:21	@PikFan	I don't think many insects can do that
2015-10-10 01:14:55	ScruffyChat	hmm
2015-10-10 01:18:20	ScruffyChat	It could have hints of mole cricket
2015-10-10 01:18:36	ScruffyChat	Mole crickets have very large, flat, shovel-like legs for burrowing
2015-10-10 01:18:42	ScruffyChat	They're common garden pests
2015-10-10 01:19:32	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-10 01:30:21	ScruffyChat	Maybe it could just leave a hole in the ground where the roots protrude from, and when it burrows back the hole is already there for ti
2015-10-10 01:30:23	ScruffyChat	it*
2015-10-10 01:31:08	ScruffyChat	Meaning it could move around while above ground (assuming it has legs) and not have to worry about the roots
2015-10-10 01:31:18	ScruffyChat	And that could establish a mechanic to the boss
2015-10-10 01:31:37	ScruffyChat	You could attack the roots, and beating them wouldn't decrease its health but would remove one of its elemental attacks
2015-10-10 01:31:58	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-10 01:32:00	@PikFan	I agree
2015-10-10 01:32:11	@PikFan	would the roots come back after a moment or two?
2015-10-10 01:36:16	ScruffyChat	Probably
2015-10-10 01:36:31	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-10-10 01:36:46	ScruffyChat	Otherwise knocking out all the roots'd make the boss boring

2015-10-10 01:47:54	ScruffyChat	Names are the fun part
2015-10-10 01:49:22	@PikFan	...how does Rhizomial Snattle sound?
2015-10-10 01:50:25	ScruffyChat	Good but I already have a Rhizomander boss
2015-10-10 01:50:33	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-10 01:50:38	ScruffyChat	But I like where you're going with Snattle
2015-10-10 01:51:00	ScruffyChat	One important thing to think of with gibberish names
2015-10-10 01:51:10	ScruffyChat	I know that sounds absolutely ridiculous
2015-10-10 01:51:47	ScruffyChat	Is that the sound of the name should reflect the enemy as well
2015-10-10 01:51:58	ScruffyChat	For example, bulborb is a very marbly word
2015-10-10 01:52:11	ScruffyChat	It sounds round, just like the shape of the bulborb
2015-10-10 01:52:19	ScruffyChat	plus it's "bulb" and "orb
2015-10-10 01:52:49	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-10 01:53:06	@PikFan	we'll talk more about this later

2015-10-10 12:36:53	@J	so I was juggling for half an hour or so
2015-10-10 12:37:09	@J	then I noticed one of the balls was split, and had been leaking seeds the whole time

2015-10-10 15:31:02	@Espyo	yes
2015-10-10 15:31:24	@Espyo	more like "thoughts on whether we should add them to the wiki or not"
2015-10-10 15:31:35	@Espyo	because of the hacky stuff, how useful it could be, etc.
2015-10-10 15:31:39	@Espyo	I think it'd be really useful
2015-10-10 15:31:51	@Espyo	we're always delaying this or that because we don't have the text for this or that
2015-10-10 15:32:37	Yoshi2	would be nice for stuff like the different log text in each language and/or version of the game
2015-10-10 15:33:02	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-10 15:33:44	Yoshi2	I'm slightly questioning the methods talked about in that thread though
2015-10-10 15:33:51	@Espyo	oh, I didn't read those
2015-10-10 15:33:59	Yoshi2	why open the iso with a hex editor if you could just unpack the iso? :v
2015-10-10 15:34:31	Yoshi2	the text should be in one of the files

2015-10-10 15:36:08	Yoshi2	ah, the last post by embyr did talk about extracting folders from the iso
2015-10-10 15:40:03	@Espyo	the more I think about it
2015-10-10 15:40:08	@Espyo	the more I think it's an incredible idea
2015-10-10 15:40:15	@Espyo	it'd be ultra useful
2015-10-10 15:40:22	@Espyo	I'm a bit on the edge because of all the hacky wacky
2015-10-10 15:40:23	@Espyo	but
2015-10-10 15:40:27	@Espyo	we have enemy stats
2015-10-10 15:40:31	@Espyo	we have some textures
2015-10-10 15:40:38	@Espyo	we have more stuff that gets taken from the game files
2015-10-10 15:40:47	@Espyo	plus a text dump isn't as bad as a texture
2015-10-10 15:40:59	@Espyo	we can just transcript the text and it'd be the same thing

2015-10-10 18:35:20	Yoshi2	fair use doesn't protect you against being sued anyway, iirc
2015-10-10 18:36:00	@Espyo	it doesn't
2015-10-10 18:40:45	@J	anyone can sue you for anything, but that doesn't mean they'll win
2015-10-10 18:41:15	@J	fair use is written into law as a valid copyright exception
2015-10-10 18:41:43	@J	when applied properly, it _does_ make acts which would otherwise be copyright infringement perfectly legal

2015-10-10 20:23:33	@Espyo	well, sure
2015-10-10 20:23:35	@Espyo	don't do a !
2015-10-10 20:23:39	@Espyo	! bla bla
2015-10-10 20:23:41	@Espyo	will create a header
2015-10-10 20:23:56	En_Passant	That's not working
2015-10-10 20:24:42	En_Passant	It's in a spoiler, which I think is breaking it
2015-10-10 20:24:51	En_Passant	The table just doesn't show up
2015-10-10 20:25:57	@Espyo	you mean Pikipedia's {{spoiler}}?

2015-10-10 20:26:27	En_Passant	The latter
2015-10-10 20:27:46	@Espyo	well, you need a header for that one
2015-10-10 20:27:57	@Espyo	the header is the warning

2015-10-10 20:28:45	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-10-10 20:29:01	En_Passant	Wait, you mean the table's header?
2015-10-10 20:29:40	@Espyo	the spoiler section template creates a table
2015-10-10 20:29:43	@Espyo	an invisible one
2015-10-10 20:29:50	@Espyo	the header of the table has the warning box
2015-10-10 20:29:57	@Espyo	the only other cell in the table has the content of the spoiler
2015-10-10 20:30:04	@Espyo	that's how I recall it being
2015-10-10 20:33:50	En_Passant	You can put a table inside of a table, though
2015-10-10 20:37:11	@Espyo	you can
2015-10-10 20:39:43	En_Passant	So why isn't it working?

2015-10-10 20:45:39	@Espyo	it's probably because of template calling trickery
2015-10-10 20:46:12	@Espyo	that {| for the table?
2015-10-10 20:46:15	@Espyo	replace it with {{{!}}

2015-10-11 18:54:37	ScruffyChat	Very well done
2015-10-11 19:04:09	@J	it should probably compile for your platform

2015-10-11 21:26:09	@Espyo	...
2015-10-11 21:26:16	@Espyo	were they before my "fix"?
2015-10-11 21:26:29	ScruffyChat	No
2015-10-11 21:26:34	ScruffyChat	I didn't know they were supposed to
2015-10-11 21:26:42	@Espyo	uh, did you zoom out?
2015-10-11 21:26:45	@Espyo	what else doesn't render?
2015-10-11 21:26:46	@Espyo	HUD? sprites?
2015-10-11 21:27:11	ScruffyChat	everything else, I can even see the shadows if I change the background color
2015-10-11 21:30:00	@Espyo	does Error_log.txt say anything?
2015-10-11 21:30:20	ScruffyChat	Where would that be
2015-10-11 21:31:03	@Espyo	program's root
2015-10-11 21:32:10	ScruffyChat	In that case I don't I have that file
2015-10-11 21:32:16	ScruffyChat	Or I can't find it at least
2015-10-11 21:32:33	@Espyo	this is so weird

2015-10-11 21:37:10	@Espyo	what's it say?
2015-10-11 21:38:25	ScruffyChat	Which file specifically loads the area textures?
2015-10-11 21:38:36	ScruffyChat	There are a lot of files that mention error_log
2015-10-11 21:38:46	@Espyo	file?
2015-10-11 21:38:47	@Espyo	like
2015-10-11 21:38:48	ScruffyChat	But I have none specifically called Error_log.txt
2015-10-11 21:38:49	@Espyo	source?
2015-10-11 21:39:13	ScruffyChat	i'm sorry i'm not really good with programming terms
2015-10-11 21:39:31	@Espyo	no worries
2015-10-11 21:39:35	ScruffyChat	There are a list of text files under the folder labeled "Source"
2015-10-11 21:39:38	@Espyo	but I just can't tell exactly what you're trying to do
2015-10-11 21:39:46	@Espyo	yeah, unless you want to compile it, you ignore those
2015-10-11 21:40:09	ScruffyChat	I'm trying to find Error_log.txt to see if it says anything about the background textures
2015-10-11 21:40:16	@Espyo	right
2015-10-11 21:40:37	@Espyo	Error_log.txt will be created on the same folder as the executable
2015-10-11 21:40:44	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-11 21:40:45	@Espyo	the game creates it if it finds errors
2015-10-11 21:40:50	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-11 21:40:53	@Espyo	what's in the Source folder is just the source code
2015-10-11 21:40:59	@Espyo	that won't be touched by the game
2015-10-11 21:41:08	ScruffyChat	Well in that case the game isn't finding any errors
2015-10-11 21:41:23	@Espyo	darn
2015-10-11 21:41:30	@Espyo	then how is it not drawing the floor...?
2015-10-11 21:41:36	@Espyo	is this still under Wine?
2015-10-11 21:41:40	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-11 21:41:46	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure how to compile it
2015-10-11 21:42:00	@Espyo	it's probably not easy even for somebody that knows programming
2015-10-11 21:42:13	@Espyo	could just be a Wine incompatibility
2015-10-11 21:42:18	ScruffyChat	Perhaps
2015-10-11 21:42:23	@Espyo	I can play it under Wine on Linux, though
2015-10-11 21:43:11	@Espyo	well, what happens if you zoom in or out?
2015-10-11 21:43:39	ScruffyChat	Zooms in and out fine, everything else works as it should
2015-10-11 21:43:49	@Espyo	I'm guessing the textures don't magically appear then
2015-10-11 21:43:53	@Espyo	because there was this old glitch...
2015-10-11 21:43:56	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah
2015-10-11 21:44:08	@Espyo	well, you do have a Game_data\Graphics\Texture folder, right?
2015-10-11 21:44:22	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-11 21:44:33	ScruffyChat	Hold on, I just tried WineBottler
2015-10-11 21:44:33	@Espyo	and they're there, I suppose...
2015-10-11 21:44:36	@Espyo	hmm
2015-10-11 21:44:37	ScruffyChat	I forgot about that
2015-10-11 21:44:39	@Espyo	never heard of that
2015-10-11 21:44:48	ScruffyChat	It can turn a Windows application into a simple OS X one
2015-10-11 21:44:51	@Espyo	(I'll be playing Splatoon, so I might take a while to reply)
2015-10-11 21:44:56	ScruffyChat	That might help
2015-10-11 21:45:00	ScruffyChat	Haha no problem
2015-10-11 21:46:26	ScruffyChat	Ok, that worked (and that PFE application has the official icon!) but it still doesn't draw the textures
2015-10-11 21:46:38	ScruffyChat	So it must just be some way my computer is reading the files
2015-10-11 21:48:27	ScruffyChat	And now I see that it is recognizing the textures
2015-10-11 21:49:07	ScruffyChat	If I take them out of the Game_data\Graphics\Textures folder, the game draws all the textures as a red "ERROR" sign
2015-10-11 21:49:24	ScruffyChat	So... maybe it's just drawing them too transparent

2015-10-11 22:25:58	ScruffyChat	I've got one more test on Tuesday and then things ought to get back to normal
2015-10-11 22:26:00	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2015-10-11 22:26:02	En_Passant	No hurry, then
2015-10-11 22:26:08	En_Passant	Real life comes first
2015-10-11 22:26:41	ScruffyChat	Have you done the presentation? That was on Friday right?
2015-10-11 22:27:09	En_Passant	That was Wednesday
2015-10-11 22:27:17	En_Passant	And it went alright
2015-10-11 22:27:28	ScruffyChat	Ah ok
2015-10-11 22:27:36	ScruffyChat	That's good
2015-10-11 22:27:41	En_Passant	Better than I expected, but it can definitely improve
2015-10-11 22:28:02	ScruffyChat	Well it's very good that you recognize both those things
2015-10-11 22:28:10	En_Passant	Doesn't help that one of the other projects is very similar to mine
2015-10-11 22:28:13	ScruffyChat	I'm glad it went well
2015-10-11 22:28:15	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-11 22:28:34	ScruffyChat	Well game programming is popular
2015-10-11 22:28:49	ScruffyChat	And film, I've noticed
2015-10-11 22:28:53	En_Passant	Not just game programming
2015-10-11 22:28:59	En_Passant	He's also doing music and modelling
2015-10-11 22:29:04	En_Passant	Actually, he's trying to make a whole game
2015-10-11 22:29:04	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-11 22:29:20	En_Passant	I don't know how he's going to do it
2015-10-11 22:29:23	@Espyo	<ScruffyChat> Please don't take this as me saying it's not good
2015-10-11 22:29:34	@Espyo	no no, if anything, I have to say I'm sorry I'm spending your time trying to solve some stupid problem
2015-10-11 22:29:40	@Espyo	it shouldn't be happening
2015-10-11 22:34:29	ScruffyChat	it's no trouble
2015-10-11 22:34:58	ScruffyChat	I've just never opened a batch file in the Command Prompt before, I can't seem to get the syntax right
2015-10-11 22:34:59	ScruffyChat	I
2015-10-11 22:35:18	ScruffyChat	I've had little Windows experience
2015-10-11 22:35:32	ScruffyChat	Or, Windows "XP" :D

2015-10-11 23:03:15	@J	but every mirror is completely missing those package repositories
2015-10-11 23:03:37	@J	1 year seems pretty soon to start just deleting them
2015-10-11 23:04:22	@Espyo	weird...
2015-10-11 23:04:30	@Espyo	isn't 14.10 trusty?

2015-10-11 23:05:12	@J	I guess t being before u would make that 14.04
2015-10-11 23:06:43	@J	I'll try and force an upgrade by messing with sources.list...
2015-10-11 23:06:47	@J	what could possibly go wrong

2015-10-12 18:20:46	En_Passant	hi
2015-10-12 18:21:20	ScruffyChat	I felt bad that I had gotten behind, so I've just finished the Pikmin V logo
2015-10-12 18:21:40	En_Passant	Don't feel bad
2015-10-12 18:21:59	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2015-10-12 18:22:13	ScruffyChat	But I'm about to upload it, I hope you like how it looks!
2015-10-12 18:22:29	ScruffyChat	And this is still a Blender file, so if anything's not right to you, I can easily fix it
2015-10-12 18:23:38	En_Passant	A Blender file?

2015-10-12 18:24:11	En_Passant	I figured you would just edit the logo in an image editor
2015-10-12 18:24:17	ScruffyChat	I mean I have it saved as a Blender file
2015-10-12 18:24:25	ScruffyChat	I cut out the flower and leaf in a photo editor
2015-10-12 18:24:49	ScruffyChat	But in order to get the flowers and leaves to cast shadows correctly, I made the "V" a 3D object
2015-10-12 18:25:00	En_Passant	I see

2015-10-12 18:31:51	ScruffyChat	It'll finally put some weight on each character

2015-10-12 19:34:51	@Espyo	eh, don't think they do
2015-10-12 19:38:17	ScruffyChat	Ok Espyo, I'm very sorry

2015-10-12 19:38:39	@Espyo	don't apologise
2015-10-12 19:38:42	ScruffyChat	I reinstalled wine
2015-10-12 19:39:12	ScruffyChat	It's just so odd that it recognizes the textures but makes them transparent
2015-10-12 19:39:20	ScruffyChat	I'm pretty confident it's Wine's doing
2015-10-12 19:39:23	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-10-12 19:39:29	ScruffyChat	Because your coding looks watertight
2015-10-12 19:39:32	@Espyo	and why just the ground textures...?
2015-10-12 19:39:36	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-12 19:39:37	@Espyo	thanks
2015-10-12 19:39:45	@Espyo	can
2015-10-12 19:39:53	@Espyo	oh, can you go to the bottom-right
2015-10-12 19:39:56	@Espyo	and open up the gate
2015-10-12 19:39:58	@Espyo	and then work on the bridge
2015-10-12 19:39:59	@Espyo	*?
2015-10-12 19:40:02	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-12 19:40:04	@Espyo	the bridge creates some ground textures
2015-10-12 19:40:12	ScruffyChat	It does that fine
2015-10-12 19:40:13	@Espyo	it's a bit open, so it shouldn't be that hard to navigate
2015-10-12 19:40:21	@Espyo	you can see the bridge's ground textures?
2015-10-12 19:40:26	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-12 19:40:32	@Espyo	not the sprite, the actual wooden texture?
2015-10-12 19:40:39	ScruffyChat	It's just all the textures that are "sectors"
2015-10-12 19:40:40	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-12 19:40:49	@Espyo	ok, now that doesn't make sense
2015-10-12 19:41:30	@Espyo	on Options.txt, can you change the area_quality to something like 0.01?
2015-10-12 19:41:44	@Espyo	maybe the images it's creating to represent the ground are too big, so it's refusing to create them?
2015-10-12 19:42:53	ScruffyChat	Even at .01 it's not working
2015-10-12 19:43:01	@Espyo	also J, what kind of janky g++ are you using?
2015-10-12 19:43:03	ScruffyChat	And the shadows are also rendering and swaying find
2015-10-12 19:43:09	@Espyo	when I compile at work, it has literally one warning
2015-10-12 19:43:12	@Espyo	can't remember which
2015-10-12 19:43:22	ScruffyChat	fine*
2015-10-12 19:43:23	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-10-12 19:47:05	ScruffyChat	So it must just be misunderstanding something about sectors
2015-10-12 19:48:02	ScruffyChat	If I replace the parameter "texture=" with "file=", then the shape is drawn, but the image is just all white
2015-10-12 19:48:37	ScruffyChat	And it isn't the image files themselves, I've tried replacing them with different ones

2015-10-12 19:49:44	En_Passant	But it might also cause complications, particularly in Mission Mode, if you fail
2015-10-12 19:49:56	@Espyo	hm, so if you replace all "texture=" with "file=" in the area's file
2015-10-12 19:50:01	@Espyo	(your editor has to have a replace all function, right?)
2015-10-12 19:50:06	@Espyo	you see the entire area as white
2015-10-12 19:50:08	En_Passant	And Olimar would need his own "upgrade" (which would be available from the start)
2015-10-12 19:50:10	@Espyo	but do you see shadows being cast from the walls?
2015-10-12 19:50:15	ScruffyChat	Yes, and yes, and yes
2015-10-12 19:50:23	--	M6_is_not_in_front_of_his_comp is now known as M6
2015-10-12 19:50:40	@Espyo	ok, so it is running the code that draws sectors
2015-10-12 19:50:45	@Espyo	because that code draws wall shadows too
2015-10-12 19:50:52	@Espyo	it really is something about the way it's handling textures
2015-10-12 19:51:14	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-12 19:51:18	@Espyo	hm, if it's ok with you, can I send you a quick .exe to see if a change I'll make fixes it?
2015-10-12 19:51:26	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-10-12 19:51:29	@Espyo	thanks
2015-10-12 19:51:36	@Espyo	now we just wait 3 hours while visual studio waits
2015-10-12 19:51:42	@Espyo	so... plenty of time to do something else to rest
2015-10-12 19:51:53	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-12 19:52:00	ScruffyChat	I actually have to go in a few minutes
2015-10-12 19:52:07	ScruffyChat	I'll be back around 5, or 10 for you
2015-10-12 19:52:28	@Espyo	hm, all right
2015-10-12 19:52:51	ScruffyChat	But really it's just my computer being weird, the program really blew me away
2015-10-12 19:53:21	ScruffyChat	It's really quite impressive
2015-10-12 19:53:22	@Espyo	wait, somebody else on Pikipedia uses Mac too
2015-10-12 19:53:25	@Espyo	I'll ask them to use Wine
2015-10-12 19:53:28	@Espyo	thanks
2015-10-12 19:53:32	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-10-12 19:53:37	ScruffyChat	Oh, one suggestion
2015-10-12 19:53:38	@Espyo	some small details still feel so jittery...
2015-10-12 19:53:40	@Espyo	hope I can fix them
2015-10-12 19:53:41	@Espyo	sure, go ahead
2015-10-12 19:53:43	ScruffyChat	I remember now
2015-10-12 19:54:04	ScruffyChat	When you lie down and Pikmin carry you to the Onion, you can still move around but the sprite disappears
2015-10-12 19:54:20	@Espyo	that uh...
2015-10-12 19:54:23	@Espyo	doesn't sound right at all
2015-10-12 19:54:37	ScruffyChat	I mean, if you're actually beamed into the Onion
2015-10-12 19:54:52	@Espyo	oh
2015-10-12 19:55:00	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think I made that part
2015-10-12 19:55:01	@Espyo	that might be it
2015-10-12 19:55:30	ScruffyChat	It's no big deal, it's a small fix
2015-10-12 19:55:43	ScruffyChat	I just wanted to let you know about ti
2015-10-12 19:55:46	@Espyo	thanks

2015-10-12 19:56:26	@Espyo	uh, scratch that
2015-10-12 19:56:31	@Espyo	looks like it's compiling from scratch
2015-10-12 19:56:34	@Espyo	even though it doesn't need to
2015-10-12 19:56:37	@Espyo	sigh, the usual
2015-10-12 19:56:37	ScruffyChat	Oh?
2015-10-12 19:56:40	@Espyo	anyway, see ya
2015-10-12 19:56:43	@Espyo	yeah, the change I said I'd make
2015-10-12 19:56:44	ScruffyChat	See ya
2015-10-12 19:56:52	@Espyo	it's just one small change... but visual studio decided to redo the whole program
2015-10-12 19:56:59	ScruffyChat	Oh i see
2015-10-12 19:57:35	ScruffyChat	Sorry to have to go then

2015-10-12 20:19:24	@J	here I have 5.2.0
2015-10-12 20:19:26	@J	both fail though
2015-10-12 20:19:40	@J	I'll grab the error from the VM after food, see if it's different
2015-10-12 20:19:57	@J	also as I showed you clang failed too

2015-10-12 20:29:46	@Espyo	the first thing is only a warning
2015-10-12 20:29:47	@Espyo	so it does compile

2015-10-12 22:22:34	@PikFan	it encourages you to—yeah
2015-10-12 22:22:45	En_Passant	But then Olimar would need one to balance it out
2015-10-12 22:22:49	@PikFan	right

2015-10-12 22:23:09	@PikFan	it isn't really an upgrade then
2015-10-12 22:23:36	@PikFan	wait, so all of them have special traits?

2015-10-12 22:29:06	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: please try this then https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/PFE_Mac_fix_1.exe
2015-10-12 22:29:09	En_Passant	So that he's not less valuable than the other two
2015-10-12 22:29:37	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-12 22:30:09	@PikFan	this goes against Pikmin standards, but what if Olimar found an upgrade that allows him to command more Pikmin
2015-10-12 22:30:09	En_Passant	As it is, being linked to Alph and Brittany is just plot justification/potential Mission Mode gimmicks
2015-10-12 22:30:28	@PikFan	that is, increases the limit to say, 120 Pikmin or so
2015-10-12 22:30:39	ScruffyChat	The error log says it can't load Font.png and Area_name_font.png
2015-10-12 22:30:41	En_Passant	Too many problems
2015-10-12 22:30:43	@PikFan	and if Olimar was down, then the limit would go down
2015-10-12 22:30:49	En_Passant	Say there's 120 on the field and Olimar is downed
2015-10-12 22:30:54	En_Passant	Who goes away?
2015-10-12 22:30:58	@PikFan	oh, true
2015-10-12 22:31:46	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm....................
2015-10-12 22:32:40	@PikFan	I got nothing, sorry
2015-10-12 22:33:04	@Espyo	replace it with the one you have
2015-10-12 22:33:05	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: how's progress on the Snattle?
2015-10-12 22:33:18	ScruffyChat	Hang on just a sec
2015-10-12 22:33:34	En_Passant	http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/3/34/Snattle.png/140px-Snattle.png
2015-10-12 22:33:36	En_Passant	This guy?
2015-10-12 22:33:37	@PikFan	Espyo: are you trying to help ScruffyChat use the engine?
2015-10-12 22:34:03	@PikFan	and En_Passant, I see nothing
2015-10-12 22:34:11	@PikFan	just an empty line
2015-10-12 22:34:21	En_Passant	No broken image?
2015-10-12 22:34:30	@PikFan	nothing
2015-10-12 22:34:41	@PikFan	not even a space
2015-10-12 22:34:48	En_Passant	huh
2015-10-12 22:35:04	En_Passant	Well, just look up Snattle
2015-10-12 22:35:06	ScruffyChat	Espyo: dang, still no luck
2015-10-12 22:35:20	@Espyo	same invisibility?
2015-10-12 22:35:23	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-12 22:35:33	ScruffyChat	Wait a minute
2015-10-12 22:35:35	@Espyo	I have to go extreme, I'm guessing
2015-10-12 22:35:48	@PikFan	wait, what's going on
2015-10-12 22:36:15	@Espyo	the engine is Windows-only ATM
2015-10-12 22:36:17	@Espyo	at least my releases are
2015-10-12 22:36:26	@Espyo	but Scruffy can run it under Mac with Wine, an... "emulator"
2015-10-12 22:36:32	@Espyo	except for him, the ground isn't showing
2015-10-12 22:36:34	@Espyo	no idea why
2015-10-12 22:36:39	@PikFan	strange
2015-10-12 22:36:42	@PikFan	J, help
2015-10-12 22:36:45	ScruffyChat	It's still not showing
2015-10-12 22:36:54	ScruffyChat	This is so odd
2015-10-12 22:37:05	ScruffyChat	What did you change between the two version?
2015-10-12 22:37:08	ScruffyChat	s*
2015-10-12 22:38:55	@Espyo	you know mipmapping?
2015-10-12 22:40:14	ScruffyChat	Umm
2015-10-12 22:41:11	@Espyo	basically, "smaller versions of the same image"
2015-10-12 22:41:20	ScruffyChat	right
2015-10-12 22:41:21	@Espyo	when you have to show one image, but in small size, you use one of these smaller versions
2015-10-12 22:41:26	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-12 22:41:28	@Espyo	anyway, mipmaps weren't being updated, months back
2015-10-12 22:41:34	@Espyo	so the ground was normal at 1.0 zoom
2015-10-12 22:41:43	@Espyo	but if you zoom out
2015-10-12 22:41:46	@Espyo	it'd draw the ground smaller
2015-10-12 22:41:49	@Espyo	so it'd use a mipmap
2015-10-12 22:42:00	@Espyo	but since those weren't being updated, they'd go to transparency
2015-10-12 22:42:05	@Espyo	this only happened on Linux
2015-10-12 22:42:07	@Espyo	OpenGL, really
2015-10-12 22:42:17	@Espyo	anyway, I made them update, but on this "patch" now I removed that
2015-10-12 22:42:21	@Espyo	to see if that was it
2015-10-12 22:42:22	@Espyo	but no...
2015-10-12 22:42:44	ScruffyChat	Yes, nothing changes if I zoom out
2015-10-12 22:43:36	@Espyo	hmm
2015-10-12 22:43:46	@Espyo	well, I'll add some extra things to help debug this tomorrow
2015-10-12 22:43:55	@Espyo	for now, I'm a bit tired, I just want to play a few games and go to bed
2015-10-12 22:43:59	@Espyo	thanks for the help so far
2015-10-12 22:44:03	ScruffyChat	no probelm
2015-10-12 22:44:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah, you should take a break
2015-10-12 22:44:26	ScruffyChat	This stuff is insane, I can barely wrap my head around it
2015-10-12 22:48:50	@PikFan	hey, Scruffy
2015-10-12 22:48:52	ScruffyChat	Hey
2015-10-12 22:49:29	@PikFan	so you were telling me how much you like my fanfiction, Mysterious World
2015-10-12 22:49:46	@PikFan	could you read my other Pikmin fanfiction, The Lost Days?
2015-10-12 22:49:55	ScruffyChat	ooh
2015-10-12 22:49:56	@PikFan	it's... only 2 chapters long
2015-10-12 22:50:02	ScruffyChat	Sure!
2015-10-12 22:50:10	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-12 22:50:12	@PikFan	here https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11346373/1/Pikmin-The-Lost-Days
2015-10-12 22:50:29	@PikFan	I'm writing the 3rd chapter right now
2015-10-12 22:51:04	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-10-12 22:51:08	ScruffyChat	I'll be reading
2015-10-12 22:51:23	@PikFan	thanks, it's much appreciated
2015-10-12 22:52:07	En_Passant	Scruffy, how should I answer your question
2015-10-12 22:55:22	ScruffyChat	Finished 1st chapter
2015-10-12 22:55:26	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2015-10-12 22:55:37	@PikFan	how was it?
2015-10-12 22:55:47	ScruffyChat	En_Passant: you mean the leader upgrade question?
2015-10-12 22:56:09	ScruffyChat	It was well-written, you certainly gave me nostalgia
2015-10-12 22:56:19	@PikFan	yay
2015-10-12 22:56:43	@PikFan	I was hoping to evoke nostalgia, while also a sense of new things
2015-10-12 22:56:52	En_Passant	I agree. You captured the end of Pikmin 1 quite well
2015-10-12 22:56:53	ScruffyChat	Right, I'm left interested in the narrator's character
2015-10-12 22:57:01	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna keep reading
2015-10-12 22:57:04	En_Passant	Scruffy: Yes
2015-10-12 22:57:09	@PikFan	oh, you read it as well, En_Passant?
2015-10-12 22:57:13	@PikFan	thank you
2015-10-12 22:57:49	ScruffyChat	PikFan: oh, wait, d'you mind if I help En_Passant really quick?
2015-10-12 22:57:56	@PikFan	sure
2015-10-12 22:58:03	@PikFan	I have time
2015-10-12 22:58:31	En_Passant	Yeah, I'm always up for a good fic
2015-10-12 22:58:58	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-12 22:59:13	@PikFan	...unlike Espyo here, he's too refined to read fics :(
2015-10-12 22:59:37	ScruffyChat	hmmm
2015-10-12 22:59:52	@PikFan	I really ought to stop manipulating people using guilt
2015-10-12 23:00:00	@PikFan	uh
2015-10-12 23:00:08	@PikFan	sorry, where were we?
2015-10-12 23:00:08	ScruffyChat	Haha it's okay
2015-10-12 23:00:28	 *	@PikFan reads logs
2015-10-12 23:00:31	@PikFan	right
2015-10-12 23:00:34	@PikFan	of course
2015-10-12 23:00:37	@PikFan	...
2015-10-12 23:00:39	@Espyo	hey, c'mon now
2015-10-12 23:00:59	@PikFan	what? :P
2015-10-12 23:01:34	@PikFan	prior to Scruffy and En_Passant, you were the only "professional" source of criticism around
2015-10-12 23:02:00	ScruffyChat	I'd hardly call myself a professional
2015-10-12 23:02:24	@PikFan	well, you're much more professional than 95% of users on Fanon
2015-10-12 23:02:47	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Talk:Purple Pikmin by 165.91.13.239 (+217 added a comment about mission mode) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Purple_Pikmin&curid=4376&diff=155560&oldid=137426
2015-10-12 23:03:02	@PikFan	most users are just kids who come up with a random game idea, work on it some, and disappear
2015-10-12 23:03:08	@PikFan	some come back
2015-10-12 23:03:14	@PikFan	but others... not so much
2015-10-12 23:03:27	@PikFan	rant aside, I appreciate your input
2015-10-12 23:03:47	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-12 23:04:12	ScruffyChat	So far on the second chapter, my only comment is that the language changed from rather formal to noticeably informal
2015-10-12 23:04:32	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2015-10-12 23:04:46	@PikFan	well, I just wanted a tense atmosphere
2015-10-12 23:04:53	ScruffyChat	I see
2015-10-12 23:05:03	@PikFan	I get what you're saying
2015-10-12 23:05:20	ScruffyChat	Well, you've established a good uncertain tone though
2015-10-12 23:06:07	@PikFan	actually, I made a revised version of Chapter 1, but I forgot to post it when I added Chapter 2
2015-10-12 23:06:27	@PikFan	I revised mainly the ending of C1
2015-10-12 23:06:49	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-12 23:06:52	@PikFan	because I noticed how upbeat it was, and then the beginning of C2 was quite somber
2015-10-12 23:06:59	@PikFan	and...
2015-10-12 23:07:03	@PikFan	well, you see my point
2015-10-12 23:07:08	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-12 23:07:17	ScruffyChat	Also, try to avoid the word "stuff"
2015-10-12 23:07:52	ScruffyChat	I believe that Things and stuff are the most abundant substances in the universe
2015-10-12 23:08:31	ScruffyChat	They're great conversational terms, but not narrational
2015-10-12 23:08:43	ScruffyChat	Narration doesn't want to skip details, in most contexts
2015-10-12 23:09:06	@PikFan	good point, I'll fix that right now
2015-10-12 23:10:11	@PikFan	"Two hours pass, and no news from Splash. The other Pikmin have gotten into a huge argument over what the berries could be used for, even though it's pretty obvious that all they can do is petrify objects. Well, there's always going to be that odd bunch that disagrees with the common opinion, I guess."
2015-10-12 23:10:29	@PikFan	not sure about "objects", thoughh
2015-10-12 23:10:35	@PikFan	*though
2015-10-12 23:11:37	ScruffyChat	I see what you mean
2015-10-12 23:11:55	ScruffyChat	Well in that case, things is a better fit than stuff
2015-10-12 23:12:23	ScruffyChat	And this tone is rather conversational anyway, since it's present tense
2015-10-12 23:12:34	@PikFan	I agree
2015-10-12 23:12:59	En_Passant	So... the Pikmin are suddenly humans?
2015-10-12 23:13:55	@PikFan	uh...
2015-10-12 23:13:57	En_Passant	With suitcases, tongues, and intellignece even though they blindly follow Olimar into water when they can't swim?
2015-10-12 23:14:34	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-12 23:15:21	@PikFan	I mean, I can't follow the canon exactly
2015-10-12 23:15:23	@PikFan	I could
2015-10-12 23:15:26	En_Passant	Also, it took ten berries to get a concentrated enough dosage to turn things to stone
2015-10-12 23:15:32	En_Passant	I guess that can be excused, though
2015-10-12 23:16:11	@PikFan	ten berries in order to be used as a spray
2015-10-12 23:16:16	@PikFan	to cover a large area
2015-10-12 23:16:44	@PikFan	well, larger area than just the berries by themselves, anyway
2015-10-12 23:17:07	ScruffyChat	So (spoilers) there's an earthquake?
2015-10-12 23:17:20	@PikFan	yes, why?
2015-10-12 23:17:32	ScruffyChat	Just wondering, do new pikmin get plucked?
2015-10-12 23:17:41	ScruffyChat	Otherwise they'd be stuck in the quaking earth
2015-10-12 23:17:41	@PikFan	...oh
2015-10-12 23:18:26	@PikFan	well, they're born after the earthquake
2015-10-12 23:18:39	ScruffyChat	So, they're just born in the Onion then
2015-10-12 23:19:55	@PikFan	...yes
2015-10-12 23:19:59	@PikFan	I made that clear now
2015-10-12 23:20:41	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-10-12 23:21:01	En_Passant	I thought it was clear... the spoils hadn't made it back to base when it happened
2015-10-12 23:21:15	@PikFan	well, I made it crystal clear
2015-10-12 23:21:33	@PikFan	about them being born in the Onion or not, anyway
2015-10-12 23:21:38	ScruffyChat	Well, yes
2015-10-12 23:21:58	ScruffyChat	I was just wondering what would happen to those 60 Pikmin before they leave
2015-10-12 23:23:43	@PikFan	"However, we're all on edge by the sudden earthquake, so we hastily take the spoils to the Onions. They produce 15 Reds, 25 Yellows, and 20 Blues, for a grand total of 60 new Pikmin! The Onions, having entered an emergency state triggered by the earthquake, don't release the new Pikmin. Instead, they are kept inside for their own safety."
2015-10-12 23:24:12	ScruffyChat	Cool, that clears it up
2015-10-12 23:24:31	@PikFan	the Onions are also implied to be semi-sentient, as well
2015-10-12 23:24:45	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-12 23:24:54	ScruffyChat	Man, good thing Olimar left when he did
2015-10-12 23:24:56	@PikFan	with the lifting off and such
2015-10-12 23:25:00	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-10-12 23:25:12	@PikFan	well, earthquakes and other tectonic activity will be frequent
2015-10-12 23:25:18	@PikFan	due to the shifting landscape'
2015-10-12 23:25:20	@PikFan	*-'
2015-10-12 23:25:22	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-12 23:25:34	@PikFan	so I figured this would be a good foreshadowing
2015-10-12 23:25:41	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2015-10-12 23:25:49	ScruffyChat	I thought it was very good
2015-10-12 23:25:59	@PikFan	thanks
2015-10-12 23:26:10	@PikFan	any other parts you had concerns about?
2015-10-12 23:26:16	ScruffyChat	Oh, but one other thing to mention
2015-10-12 23:26:21	@PikFan	yes?
2015-10-12 23:26:30	@PikFan	make it quick, I gotta go
2015-10-12 23:26:35	ScruffyChat	There are several times when you use parentheses to explain things
2015-10-12 23:26:39	ScruffyChat	This interrupts the flow
2015-10-12 23:27:00	ScruffyChat	You can explain things like how onions work or where Pikmin got their names in later text
2015-10-12 23:27:05	ScruffyChat	When the focus is on them
2015-10-12 23:27:23	ScruffyChat	But right now, it's just exposition of the world and of Pikmin daily life
2015-10-12 23:27:48	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-12 23:27:49	ScruffyChat	I'd say if there's a prolonged setting in the Onion, you could explain its parts then
2015-10-12 23:27:56	@PikFan	good point
2015-10-12 23:28:22	@PikFan	well, even one set of parentheses is one too much
2015-10-12 23:28:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah...
2015-10-12 23:28:32	@PikFan	here, anyway
2015-10-12 23:28:37	@PikFan	but thanks for all your advice
2015-10-12 23:28:40	ScruffyChat	It's better to have everything be to the point
2015-10-12 23:28:43	ScruffyChat	no problem!
2015-10-12 23:28:48	@PikFan	I gotta go now
2015-10-12 23:28:52	@PikFan	be on tomorrow
2015-10-12 23:28:53	ScruffyChat	I really enjoyed it, I'm excited for the third chapter
2015-10-12 23:28:55	@PikFan	bye
2015-10-12 23:28:55	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-12 23:28:57	ScruffyChat	Bye
2015-10-12 23:28:59	@PikFan	thanks
2015-10-12 23:29:01	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@ljsc-898-846.shs.lane.edu) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-10-12 23:29:04	ScruffyChat	You're welcome
2015-10-12 23:29:36	ScruffyChat	Now, En_Passant, I've been trying to pick apart that question of what happens to upgrades when leaders are down
2015-10-12 23:29:49	ScruffyChat	And I think you could either have a leader-healing system
2015-10-12 23:30:13	ScruffyChat	Or have a very limited version of the upgrade until the next day when the leader recoveres
2015-10-12 23:31:01	ScruffyChat	In Option 1, you could have it so if Pikmin bring a fallen leader back to the ship, they could undergo healing and be back in maybe two minutes
2015-10-12 23:31:11	ScruffyChat	Although this wouldn't work in caves
2015-10-12 23:31:19	ScruffyChat	I'm still trying to figure that out
2015-10-12 23:32:28	ScruffyChat	In Option 2, you could have it so if Brittany is downed, the player can only use one more of each spray they have for the day
2015-10-12 23:33:04	ScruffyChat	Or, really, just eliminate sprays if Brittany is downed, I would always forget to use them
2015-10-12 23:33:46	ScruffyChat	But Planning is important, if Alph is downed it can't just be eliminated
2015-10-12 23:34:32	ScruffyChat	So I was thinking maybe instead of having the entire map revealed as you discover it, like normal
2015-10-12 23:35:19	ScruffyChat	When Alph is down a radius of the map around you would be revealed as you discover it
2015-10-12 23:35:53	ScruffyChat	Meaning you could only send leaders so far
2015-10-12 23:36:14	ScruffyChat	Or perhaps instead, when Alph is down you can send leaders on routes but not groups of Pikmin by themselve
2015-10-12 23:36:20	ScruffyChat	themselves*
2015-10-12 23:36:37	ScruffyChat	Let me know what you think whenever you're back, I'll be back in a little bit

2015-10-12 23:54:07	En_Passant	Leader healing is out of the question, I like the punishment of having to wait until the next day to use them.
2015-10-12 23:57:34	ScruffyChat	Okay
2015-10-12 23:58:13	En_Passant	The limited version could work (Planning is only setting routes, not using Overhead Move at all), but I dunno
2015-10-12 23:58:23	En_Passant	It feels somewhat arbitrary, and still requires an upgrade for Olimar
2015-10-12 23:58:28	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-12 23:59:06	ScruffyChat	I just feel gameplay is severely limited when Planning is removed, if the areas are really big at least
2015-10-12 23:59:18	En_Passant	Again, I don't have to have this system, it was just an idea
2015-10-12 23:59:26	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-12 23:59:57	En_Passant	My original idea with linking it to the characters was just the knowledge
2015-10-13 00:00:55	ScruffyChat	oh, well that works
2015-10-13 00:03:28	ScruffyChat	Like, you can collect sprays if you find them, but rescuing Brittany is the key to using them at all
2015-10-13 00:03:50	@Espyo	night
2015-10-13 00:03:53	En_Passant	night
2015-10-13 00:04:00	ScruffyChat	night Espyo
2015-10-13 00:04:34	En_Passant	The way I thought of it was that only Brittany had the information on how to get the extract

2015-10-13 00:05:25	En_Passant	The Drake is crashed, the Data Files were left behind, and the new Hocotate ship wasn't built for intelligence

2015-10-13 00:05:53	ScruffyChat	Ah, that makes sense
2015-10-13 00:06:23	ScruffyChat	Well then sure, Brittany could "unlock" sprays in that way
2015-10-13 00:06:28	En_Passant	It would be like her to make a copy of that information, given that she's the botanist
2015-10-13 00:06:38	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-13 00:07:13	ScruffyChat	But if that's the case, then I suppose her being downed wouldn't prevent the others from knowing how to collect sprays
2015-10-13 00:09:30	ScruffyChat	I've got 10 minutes then I have to go
2015-10-13 00:10:34	En_Passant	Okay
2015-10-13 00:11:03	ScruffyChat	I would encourage limitations when a leader is down, something that doesn't halt gameplay but really makes you feel "Aww, I shouldn't have done that."
2015-10-13 00:11:42	ScruffyChat	Like, maybe Alph's spacesuit has the most powerful radar (being the engineer), so the fog of war disappears in a wide radius around leaders
2015-10-13 00:12:04	ScruffyChat	But when Alph is downed, the radius becomes very small, and only revealed a little bit at a time
2015-10-13 00:12:08	ScruffyChat	Maybe
2015-10-13 00:14:30	ScruffyChat	Or perhaps you could link Alph with the Treasure Hunter?
2015-10-13 00:14:46	En_Passant	I could
2015-10-13 00:14:48	ScruffyChat	No Alph, no telling where treasures are for the rest of the day?
2015-10-13 00:15:13	ScruffyChat	Although that'd get pretty tiresome in caves, assuming they work the same way as P2
2015-10-13 00:15:43	En_Passant	They don't
2015-10-13 00:15:47	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-13 00:15:57	En_Passant	[[f:Pikmin V#Regions]]
2015-10-13 00:16:05	En_Passant	Wait, Testyo left
2015-10-13 00:16:13	ScruffyChat	Oh, I see
2015-10-13 00:16:54	ScruffyChat	That's exactly the way I'd like caves to go in my game
2015-10-13 00:17:02	ScruffyChat	You've got so manyy really good ideas
2015-10-13 00:17:23	ScruffyChat	But yes, in that case Planning seems to be very important to the game
2015-10-13 00:18:05	ScruffyChat	If Alph were paired with something like the Treasure Hunter, keeping him alive would be important, but not crucial to completing a day productively
2015-10-13 00:18:48	ScruffyChat	Certainly it's more important to keep him alive than in P3, where anyone can go
2015-10-13 00:19:05	ScruffyChat	Now we just need something that Olimar does

2015-10-13 00:19:54	En_Passant	What would we do with Planning if it wasn't linked to Alph?
2015-10-13 00:20:28	ScruffyChat	Planning would become more and more difficult on its own since there are fewer leaders
2015-10-13 00:20:34	ScruffyChat	And fewer tasks that can be done at once
2015-10-13 00:20:53	En_Passant	Well, that's true with downed leaders no matter what the other costs are
2015-10-13 00:20:59	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-13 00:21:05	En_Passant	And it was also that way in P3
2015-10-13 00:21:10	ScruffyChat	Planning is inherently limited when leaders are gone
2015-10-13 00:21:24	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry to cut this short but I have to go
2015-10-13 00:22:06	ScruffyChat	I don't think I'll be back on until tomorrow
2015-10-13 00:22:10	En_Passant	I need to do homework anyway lol
2015-10-13 00:22:17	ScruffyChat	Hehe me too, eventually
2015-10-13 00:22:21	ScruffyChat	Anyway see ya
2015-10-13 00:22:28	En_Passant	I won't be available much tomorrow, unfortunately

2015-10-13 18:27:53	Klemen702	let's just hope it won't lower a already undersold product's sales....
2015-10-13 18:29:52	Yoshi2	it shouldn't have any direct effect on the sales
2015-10-13 18:30:25	Klemen702	yeah
2015-10-13 18:30:28	Klemen702	only a little
2015-10-13 18:30:47	Klemen702	considering most of the piraters probably can't even buy consoles
2015-10-13 18:32:03	Yoshi2	the only negative effect I see that can come from this is that some third party publishers/developers will become too scared to bring out new games
2015-10-13 18:32:18	Yoshi2	but third party support is already meh

2015-10-13 19:07:45	@Espyo	having a single Winged Pikmin attack a Snitchbug and then a single Yellow should be enough

2015-10-13 19:08:29	Klemen702	if i remember correctly, there was a disscusion here to put false information on the wikia to convince people to join pikipedia

2015-10-13 19:40:57	ScruffyChat	Hey En_Passant, whenever you're back on
2015-10-13 19:41:19	ScruffyChat	I've been trying Fruity Loops, I didn't really know what kind of music software it was
2015-10-13 19:41:35	ScruffyChat	But now that I realize what it is, I'm not sure it's the best option
2015-10-13 19:41:44	@Espyo	really?
2015-10-13 19:41:48	@Espyo	I hear so many great things about it
2015-10-13 19:41:50	@Espyo	interesting
2015-10-13 19:41:59	ScruffyChat	I watched your presentation, you did very well
2015-10-13 19:42:19	ScruffyChat	But you said you wanted to learn to read sheet music and about music theory
2015-10-13 19:42:22	@Espyo	oh yeah, I have a lot of mails today
2015-10-13 19:42:23	@Espyo	somehow
2015-10-13 19:42:46	ScruffyChat	Fruity Loops isn't about those, Fruity Loops is for making small repetitive beats quickly
2015-10-13 19:42:56	@Espyo	wow
2015-10-13 19:43:08	ScruffyChat	It's not meant for in depth musical work
2015-10-13 19:43:10	@Espyo	I'll watch the presentation in 7
2015-10-13 19:43:19	ScruffyChat	Which is why I have another idea
2015-10-13 19:44:21	ScruffyChat	If you want to have the best experience with learning music theory, you can hand-write your composition on staff paper (or on some free notation software), send it to me, and I can use Notion to render the music
2015-10-13 19:44:43	ScruffyChat	That way you create real music while still not having to pay anything
2015-10-13 19:45:05	ScruffyChat	But handwriting is the best experience; Fruity Loops doesn't have any sheet music options
2015-10-13 19:45:40	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry about that; I didn't realize Fruity Loops, while free, is not really serious
2015-10-13 19:46:37	ScruffyChat	Unless you would still like to use Fruity Loops, for example if you wanted a simple synthesized score
2015-10-13 19:46:57	ScruffyChat	It's up to you; I'm just suggesting one method that may better suit your interests
2015-10-13 19:47:38	En_Passant	Because I'm new to sheet music and notes and all of that, I think it's important that I be able to hear what I'm writing
2015-10-13 19:47:52	En_Passant	Because otherwise I won't have a clue
2015-10-13 19:47:57	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-13 19:48:19	ScruffyChat	I would recommend something like MuseScore then
2015-10-13 19:48:23	@Espyo	.m4v?
2015-10-13 19:48:26	@Espyo	huh, never heard of that format
2015-10-13 19:48:37	ScruffyChat	Fruity Loops's interface confuses me
2015-10-13 19:49:12	ScruffyChat	And it seems to be focused on making "patterns," which apparently is small groups of music to be repeated
2015-10-13 19:49:34	@Espyo	if I can just comment on your presentation real quick
2015-10-13 19:49:37	@Espyo	a bit slower and a bit louder
2015-10-13 19:49:43	@Espyo	not that important, but it'd help
2015-10-13 19:49:48	En_Passant	Doesn't surprise me, Espyo
2015-10-13 19:49:55	@Espyo	ow
2015-10-13 19:49:58	@Espyo	I had to put my volume up
2015-10-13 19:50:02	@Espyo	you highlighted my nickname
2015-10-13 19:50:07	@Espyo	my eardrums nearly blew up with the sound
2015-10-13 19:50:08	En_Passant	lol
2015-10-13 19:50:14	@Espyo	RIP
2015-10-13 19:50:25	En_Passant	I don't get sounds when my name is highlighted
2015-10-13 19:50:25	ScruffyChat	Wait, you can link your name to a sound?
2015-10-13 19:50:55	@Espyo	you can set it up
2015-10-13 19:50:59	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-13 19:51:04	@Espyo	you can on HexChat, but you can on Mibbit too anyway
2015-10-13 19:51:08	@Espyo	if you have a Mibbit account
2015-10-13 19:51:23	ScruffyChat	I see
2015-10-13 19:51:27	En_Passant	I have one, but I don't think it's used on Pikipedia's plugin
2015-10-13 19:51:48	@Espyo	no, don't think it is
2015-10-13 19:51:56	@Espyo	oh, AS?
2015-10-13 19:52:03	@Espyo	a good friend of mine has it, so I'm familiar
2015-10-13 19:52:04	En_Passant	Yeppers
2015-10-13 19:52:09	@Espyo	you're doing all right on the presentation
2015-10-13 19:52:18	@Espyo	so I couldn't tell until you pointed it out
2015-10-13 19:52:18	En_Passant	Also, I just grabbed the first dvd ripper from Google
2015-10-13 19:52:36	@Espyo	oh, that'd explain the .m4v format
2015-10-13 19:52:45	En_Passant	I think it said it was MP4
2015-10-13 19:52:53	En_Passant	Music 4 Video or something???
2015-10-13 19:52:57	ScruffyChat	Amazing that that's all it takes to make a DVD
2015-10-13 19:53:03	@Espyo	dunno
2015-10-13 19:53:16	@Espyo	>pathfinding, which is very complex
2015-10-13 19:53:17	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-10-13 19:53:19	@Espyo	you're right, yeah
2015-10-13 19:53:24	@Espyo	oh, pathfinding can become ridiculously hard
2015-10-13 19:53:27	@Espyo	but in the Pikmin games, it's piss-easy
2015-10-13 19:54:17	En_Passant	... yeah, that's true. Maybe if I'm still on pace I can try to make it better
2015-10-13 19:54:24	@Espyo	for sure
2015-10-13 19:54:31	ScruffyChat	M4V is basically an MP4 made by Apple so they can copy-protect it
2015-10-13 19:54:40	@Espyo	actually, it does take some thought
2015-10-13 19:54:48	@Espyo	I know I've learned in school some pathfinding algorithms
2015-10-13 19:54:51	@Espyo	and Pikmin uses a basic one
2015-10-13 19:54:54	@Espyo	but still, it's an algorithm
2015-10-13 19:54:57	@Espyo	it'll be fun to use, at least
2015-10-13 19:55:03	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: bleh
2015-10-13 19:55:06	En_Passant	Anyway, I'll be back in 20, it's time to go home from school
2015-10-13 19:55:14	ScruffyChat	Ok see ya
2015-10-13 19:55:17	@Espyo	oh, okay
2015-10-13 19:55:22	@Espyo	I'll give you my feedback later

2015-10-13 20:35:55	@J	okay, sure, sounds interesting
2015-10-13 20:36:12	@J	does Unreal have a specific programming language?
2015-10-13 20:36:45	@J	I think I've only seen it advertised as a GUI thing, but most of these sorts of programs do have a language too
2015-10-13 20:37:33	En_Passant	C++
2015-10-13 20:38:02	En_Passant	I've heard it's actually easier to use the GUI, though
2015-10-13 20:38:25	@J	it always depends on what you want to do
2015-10-13 20:38:53	@J	but yeah, GUIs in general were invented to be easier for some tasks, or for unfamiliar tasks

2015-10-13 22:56:28	@PikFan	well, nobody can truly understand 4D
2015-10-13 22:56:33	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-13 22:56:35	@PikFan	but it's still very interesting
2015-10-13 22:57:04	@PikFan	the only ones I can understand are 5-cells and tesseracts
2015-10-13 22:57:15	@PikFan	anything higher my mind explodes
2015-10-13 22:57:28	@PikFan	they are just too... complicated
2015-10-13 22:57:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 22:58:11	ScruffyChat	But now I understand why a 4D object would cast a 3D shadow

2015-10-13 23:00:20	ScruffyChat	making a 3D object and having one axis represent 4D
2015-10-13 23:00:39	ScruffyChat	And really the model could be either 4D space or 4D time
2015-10-13 23:00:43	ScruffyChat	it doesn't matter
2015-10-13 23:00:46	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-13 23:01:21	@PikFan	trying to have a W axis in 3D doesn't really make sense
2015-10-13 23:01:34	@PikFan	and yet, having a Z axis in 2D makes perfect sense to us
2015-10-13 23:01:59	@PikFan	...probably because we see in 2D and are used to seeing it that way
2015-10-13 23:02:05	ScruffyChat	Well that's just it; I've figured how to make a W axis, I think
2015-10-13 23:02:16	@PikFan	nice
2015-10-13 23:02:34	ScruffyChat	There's a modifier you can put on a 3d object called Array
2015-10-13 23:02:49	ScruffyChat	which makes geometrical copies of the object
2015-10-13 23:02:50	@PikFan	yes?
2015-10-13 23:02:54	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-13 23:02:57	ScruffyChat	For example, if I have a cube
2015-10-13 23:03:05	@PikFan	you can copy it
2015-10-13 23:03:07	ScruffyChat	Array will make 2 cubes 
2015-10-13 23:03:11	ScruffyChat	Or 16 cubes
2015-10-13 23:03:15	ScruffyChat	Arranged in a line
2015-10-13 23:03:30	@PikFan	so I've been wondering...
2015-10-13 23:03:44	@PikFan	if a tesseract looks like a cube in a cube...
2015-10-13 23:04:03	@PikFan	then would the 5th dimensional be a cube inside a cube inside ANOTHER cube inside YET ANOTHER cube?

2015-10-13 23:04:55	@PikFan	and yeah, I fixed the numbers on your Piklopedia
2015-10-13 23:04:55	ScruffyChat	Oh, thanks!
2015-10-13 23:05:02	@PikFan	no problem
2015-10-13 23:05:14	ScruffyChat	I meant to fix that later, I just was stalling in case I thought of more enemies
2015-10-13 23:05:26	ScruffyChat	But none have come so far, so that's for the best at the moment
2015-10-13 23:05:33	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-13 23:05:35	ScruffyChat	Thank you for saving me all that time

2015-10-13 23:07:23	Nvortex	k
2015-10-13 23:07:54	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: how did you come up with Bucephalous?
2015-10-13 23:08:21	ScruffyChat	"Bucephalus" was the horse of Alexander the Great
2015-10-13 23:08:22	@PikFan	I think I know where you made Mongret (Snagret + monster), but I'm not sure how you came up with Bucephalous
2015-10-13 23:08:27	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-13 23:08:30	ScruffyChat	It was a man-eating horse
2015-10-13 23:08:49	ScruffyChat	And known for its ferocious power
2015-10-13 23:09:00	ScruffyChat	Alexander was the only one who could tame ti
2015-10-13 23:09:02	ScruffyChat	it*
2015-10-13 23:09:17	ScruffyChat	Technically it means "large head"

2015-10-13 23:09:25	ScruffyChat	But "bucephalous" is not a word
2015-10-13 23:09:41	ScruffyChat	But neither is "vehemoth" or "quaggled"
2015-10-13 23:09:57	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-13 23:10:36	@PikFan	I also thought it might have to do with "encephalon"
2015-10-13 23:10:43	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-13 23:11:06	@PikFan	that one refers to the brain, so it's similar, I suppose
2015-10-13 23:12:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 23:12:12	ScruffyChat	I don't know, I'm not sure what it's going to be yet
2015-10-13 23:12:15	ScruffyChat	The name might change
2015-10-13 23:12:19	ScruffyChat	I still like Snattle

2015-10-13 23:12:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 23:12:38	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-13 23:12:48	ScruffyChat	It depends on what it looks like
2015-10-13 23:12:49	@PikFan	how's the design on the boss itself going?
2015-10-13 23:12:51	@PikFan	right
2015-10-13 23:12:52	Nvortex	cephalus means head

2015-10-13 23:18:20	ScruffyChat	The Bucephalous Mongret
2015-10-13 23:18:28	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	the WHAT?!?
2015-10-13 23:18:33	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	o
2015-10-13 23:18:35	ScruffyChat	It was the Lunar Long Legs, but that had a lot of problems with it
2015-10-13 23:18:49	Nvortex	oh really?
2015-10-13 23:18:55	Nvortex	what does it do now?
2015-10-13 23:19:08	Nvortex	is it still an arachnorb?
2015-10-13 23:19:14	ScruffyChat	Not anymore
2015-10-13 23:19:19	@PikFan	it's like a chimera of a Snagret and a beetle
2015-10-13 23:19:19	ScruffyChat	I believe it will be a Snavian
2015-10-13 23:19:20	Nvortex	(somewhat fan of pikmin forever here)

2015-10-13 23:19:59	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	i literally thought of what a bulborb would be in my game
2015-10-13 23:20:20	@PikFan	hm, so I'm imagining what the body would look like...
2015-10-13 23:20:24	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	really, Testyo
2015-10-13 23:20:25	Testyo	so all you're saying is 'the game probably uses the one before was last Saturday
2015-10-13 23:20:45	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	|:L
2015-10-13 23:21:00	@PikFan	and... it's probably not right, but I imagine it's got a huge body
2015-10-13 23:21:16	@PikFan	it should be slender, but I keep thinking of it as being big and round
2015-10-13 23:21:25	@PikFan	like a giant mass of roots
2015-10-13 23:21:27	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	me?
2015-10-13 23:21:29	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 23:21:37	@PikFan	I don't know why
2015-10-13 23:21:48	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	It has hands
2015-10-13 23:21:49	@PikFan	probably because of the Plasm Wraith
2015-10-13 23:21:59	@PikFan	or rather, the Mysterious Life Form
2015-10-13 23:22:02	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-13 23:22:14	ScruffyChat	Well, I like the idea of a giant mass of roots
2015-10-13 23:22:18	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	A Blublord
2015-10-13 23:22:20	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-13 23:22:23	ScruffyChat	But Nvortex, you need clarification
2015-10-13 23:22:35	Nvortex	first i need to know how exactly will the mongret work because the long legs had that antigravity and weather controlling right?
2015-10-13 23:22:43	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-13 23:22:44	Nvortex	will the story change with this new final boss?
2015-10-13 23:22:45	@PikFan	the Mongret itself will still be thin and slender, like a regular Snagret... right?
2015-10-13 23:22:49	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-13 23:22:52	ScruffyChat	and yes
2015-10-13 23:22:57	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-10-13 23:23:01	ScruffyChat	So, instead of a final area with Onion moons
2015-10-13 23:23:15	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	[[f:Pikmin Crimson Flame]]
2015-10-13 23:23:15	@PikFan	inside the root system of a giant Onion tree

2015-10-13 23:23:23	ScruffyChat	(Because moons with their own gravity cannot be so close to Earth without causing extreme damage)

2015-10-13 23:25:25	ScruffyChat	them*

2015-10-13 23:25:50	En_Passant	The moon idea required breaking physics greatly
2015-10-13 23:25:58	ScruffyChat	Yes yes
2015-10-13 23:26:07	ScruffyChat	So there is a huge tree
2015-10-13 23:26:12	ScruffyChat	That fruits Onions
2015-10-13 23:26:18	Nvortex	yeah thats why i said "somewhat fan"
2015-10-13 23:26:24	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-13 23:26:33	Nvortex	the logic defying moons were a bit off for my tastes

2015-10-13 23:28:11	Nvortex	how much are you wiling to change?

2015-10-13 23:28:46	ScruffyChat	Because it's unexpected and incites the story

2015-10-13 23:29:54	Nvortex	pikmin are saved as liquids in special chambers
2015-10-13 23:30:44	Nvortex	or atleast thats what we used to think until the new onions came
2015-10-13 23:30:53	Nvortex	now everything is liquid inside
2015-10-13 23:31:12	ScruffyChat	I always thought Onions had a 4D inside

2015-10-13 23:40:12	ScruffyChat	So, when a Master Onion grows it becomes a Pikmin tree that fruits more Onions
2015-10-13 23:40:19	ScruffyChat	The Mongret is a parasite

2015-10-13 23:40:59	ScruffyChat	So it can inherit abilities and elements Pikmin have
2015-10-13 23:41:21	Nvortex	i think i know where you are going but heres the problem:
2015-10-13 23:41:29	Nvortex	fire resistance =/= fire abilities
2015-10-13 23:41:35	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	?
2015-10-13 23:41:37	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 23:41:56	QuanPhysPlsPikFan	join 
2015-10-13 23:42:14	Nvortex	quanphys i mean that red pikmin are fire resistance but that doesnt mean they spew fire
2015-10-13 23:42:21	Nvortex	resistant*
2015-10-13 23:42:41	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-13 23:42:41	<--	QuanPhysPlsPikFan (Mibbit@32.208.ix.ws) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-10-13 23:42:54	ScruffyChat	And in Pikmin Forever you can ignite Pikmin leaves but you still need a source
2015-10-13 23:42:59	ScruffyChat	There wouldn't be fire inside a tree
2015-10-13 23:43:18	ScruffyChat	Red Pikmin leaves*
2015-10-13 23:43:33	Nvortex	i once thought of that too
2015-10-13 23:43:50	Nvortex	like pikmin having elemental abilities based on their respective resistance
2015-10-13 23:44:17	<--	En_Passant (Mibbit@80-979-99-97.hlrn.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-10-13 23:44:25	ScruffyChat	But it doesn't make sense to just give a boss that ability
2015-10-13 23:44:29	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-10-13 23:44:55	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Vegetation by Pikpikonion27 (+15 /* Enemies as vegetation */) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Vegetation&curid=10064&diff=155575&oldid=151897
2015-10-13 23:46:29	Nvortex	maybe the mongret has the catalyst for that ability, maybe you sometimes find special nectar eggs with a certain spray that makes the pikmin elemental and its later revealed that those nectar eggs are actually mongret eggs
2015-10-13 23:48:07	ScruffyChat	Maybe
2015-10-13 23:48:26	ScruffyChat	yeah, that could work
2015-10-13 23:48:42	ScruffyChat	So there'd be nectar for every color of Pikmin?
2015-10-13 23:48:51	ScruffyChat	type*
2015-10-13 23:49:28	Nvortex	welll thats your choice, i was thinking of a single for each type like a green one that pikmin cant drink, it has to be sprayed on
2015-10-13 23:50:03	Nvortex	is the mongret a real snavian or just something that looks like it?
2015-10-13 23:50:53	Nvortex	since the onions supposedly gather dna, i was thinking of some life form that was formed inside a sick onion that created that thing that can actively change its own dna and gain abilities from other creatures
2015-10-13 23:51:10	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-13 23:51:15	Nvortex	like having the dna from  the whole planet
2015-10-13 23:51:21	ScruffyChat	For your own game, or is this a suggestion for mine?
2015-10-13 23:51:27	Nvortex	for you
2015-10-13 23:51:31	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-10-13 23:51:41	ScruffyChat	That could really work
2015-10-13 23:52:04	ScruffyChat	I like to think about roots, especially fungal roots
2015-10-13 23:52:16	ScruffyChat	They connect plants across a really long distance
2015-10-13 23:52:33	ScruffyChat	Perhaps this boss is not an animal at all
2015-10-13 23:52:38	ScruffyChat	But some sort of fungal mold
2015-10-13 23:52:47	ScruffyChat	Sentient, of course
2015-10-13 23:53:16	@Espyo	going to sleep
2015-10-13 23:53:17	@Espyo	night
2015-10-13 23:53:19	ScruffyChat	And it's burrowed in the tree formed from an Onion, so it has access to planetary dna
2015-10-13 23:53:21	Nvortex	gnight
2015-10-13 23:53:23	ScruffyChat	Night Espyo
2015-10-13 23:53:27	Nvortex	yeah i was thinking that too
2015-10-13 23:53:27	<--	Espyo (Espyo@l81-056-17-26.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-10-13 23:53:30	<--	Testyo (Testyo@l81-056-17-26.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-10-13 23:53:37	Nvortex	becuase of the root things you mentioned
2015-10-13 23:53:43	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 23:53:54	ScruffyChat	So, maybe it'll take one more rethinking of the final boss
2015-10-13 23:54:01	ScruffyChat	But that actually sounds really cool
2015-10-13 23:54:14	ScruffyChat	It's like your fighting nature's computer virus
2015-10-13 23:54:37	ScruffyChat	Or, actually, it's kind of like fighting a search engine
2015-10-13 23:54:58	Nvortex	this idea actually came from a creature i thought a long time ago
2015-10-13 23:55:08	Nvortex	but it makes more sense in your game because of the whole dna gathering
2015-10-13 23:55:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-13 23:57:54	Nvortex	mine was something called "dum seed" which wasn eyeless trilegged creature that could get inside other enemies and control them with the ends of its leg which actually serve as a fake nervous system, the stab the animal and gain full contrl over them, later they combine their dna with the host making the former a "living" nest for more parasites, they cant-
2015-10-13 23:59:21	Nvortex	survive nature alone, they have to infect another living being and gain control over them to survive
2015-10-14 00:00:00	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 00:00:07	ScruffyChat	That's a really cool idea
2015-10-14 00:00:11	Nvortex	they can infect everything as long as they dont have a hard shell like insects or plants
2015-10-14 00:00:24	Nvortex	an infected bulborb would later be called "dum bulborb"
2015-10-14 00:00:36	Nvortex	(dum, a pun on doom)
2015-10-14 00:01:24	Nvortex	them alone are electrical enemies, they can pikmin with their arms
2015-10-14 00:02:06	Nvortex	they can shock*
2015-10-14 00:02:11	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 00:02:14	ScruffyChat	Makes sense
2015-10-14 00:02:23	ScruffyChat	Since their false nervous systems
2015-10-14 00:02:37	ScruffyChat	I really think that's the answer to this boss
2015-10-14 00:03:12	ScruffyChat	Except this mold has infested the whole tree, the whole area
2015-10-14 00:03:23	ScruffyChat	Maybe it can turn the tree against you
2015-10-14 00:04:22	Nvortex	maybe near the end you start realizing that the tree is withering because the mongret is absorbing everything from it so you have to kill it before its too late
2015-10-14 00:04:31	Nvortex	near the end of the game i mean
2015-10-14 00:04:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 00:04:54	ScruffyChat	You will only discover the tree in the last area though
2015-10-14 00:05:14	Nvortex	i know
2015-10-14 00:05:25	Nvortex	i meant that you see the tree is withering
2015-10-14 00:05:54	Nvortex	what do you think the plasm wraith is?
2015-10-14 00:06:48	ScruffyChat	hmm
2015-10-14 00:06:54	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2015-10-14 00:07:17	ScruffyChat	But I like to imagine they got the idea from the robot in the second Terminator movie
2015-10-14 00:07:24	Nvortex	what i like to think is that the plasm wraith is a mass of nanobots
2015-10-14 00:07:28	ScruffyChat	Who could essentially do the same things
2015-10-14 00:07:36	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2015-10-14 00:07:51	ScruffyChat	That's really cool
2015-10-14 00:07:51	Nvortex	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo
2015-10-14 00:07:56	Nvortex	something like this
2015-10-14 00:08:09	Nvortex	except that it didnt cause the end of the world
2015-10-14 00:08:38	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-14 00:08:44	ScruffyChat	It just really likes Olimar
2015-10-14 00:09:23	Nvortex	i mean it has everything, self replication, electrical currents, temperature changing, radiowaves, liquefaction, solidification
2015-10-14 00:09:32	Nvortex	just by altering the way its shaped it could do that
2015-10-14 00:09:43	Nvortex	talking about sci fi nanobots
2015-10-14 00:09:58	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 00:10:12	Nvortex	also i like to think it "likes" olimar becuase he has the cosmic drive key whic attracts the nanobots to it
2015-10-14 00:10:18	Nvortex	maybe as an energy source or something
2015-10-14 00:10:21	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 00:10:38	ScruffyChat	Well in that case it should have stretched out its body to try and reach the ship
2015-10-14 00:10:42	Nvortex	but thats just me of course
2015-10-14 00:10:45	ScruffyChat	As it was blasting off
2015-10-14 00:10:52	ScruffyChat	That would've been so cool
2015-10-14 00:10:59	ScruffyChat	For me it was a bit of an anticlimax
2015-10-14 00:11:10	Nvortex	i ALSO like to think that the plasm wraith has nanobots scattered throught the atmosphere which cuases ships to fail
2015-10-14 00:11:21	ScruffyChat	Oh that's good
2015-10-14 00:11:48	ScruffyChat	That could set up a whole backstory of how Earth went from humans to the state it's in
2015-10-14 00:12:26	ScruffyChat	Somebody made sentient self-replicating nanobots and they crashed everything
2015-10-14 00:12:44	Nvortex	but cellphones in-game :v
2015-10-14 00:12:55	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-14 00:13:22	ScruffyChat	That's what I wonder; how would those phones get a signal?
2015-10-14 00:14:11	Nvortex	also other thing i like to think is that IF the plasm wraiht is related to the waterwraith and IF they are actual extra dimensional beings, maybe the plasm wrait is attracted to the cosmic drive key because its it only way to fully get into pnf-404's dimension
2015-10-14 00:14:27	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-14 00:14:29	Nvortex	how are those phones working is a better question actually lol
2015-10-14 00:14:48	ScruffyChat	It is cosmic drive, it definitely involves spacetime warping
2015-10-14 00:15:12	ScruffyChat	I have to go, I think I'll be back in maybe half an hour
2015-10-14 00:15:17	Nvortex	and the plasm wraith seems to be more in this dimension than the other
2015-10-14 00:15:19	Nvortex	bye
2015-10-14 00:15:25	ScruffyChat	bye

2015-10-14 18:25:16	En_Passant	I think I need to get a new region boss in Dry Canyon
2015-10-14 18:25:28	En_Passant	I can't think of more than two attacks for the Mawfish
2015-10-14 18:25:44	En_Passant	Plus, it's really similar to the Sandbelching Meerslug
2015-10-14 18:46:18	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-14 18:46:25	ScruffyChat	What would the two attacks be?
2015-10-14 18:47:28	En_Passant	Chasing the group and leaping out of the sand
2015-10-14 18:48:00	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 18:48:15	ScruffyChat	Would it "swim" through the sand?
2015-10-14 18:49:36	En_Passant	Yes, by sifting it
2015-10-14 18:50:24	En_Passant	Limnivorous fish eat a mouthful of sand and then sift it out to retain the nutrients in it
2015-10-14 18:50:45	En_Passant	I think that's really cool, so I made something of it
2015-10-14 18:50:51	ScruffyChat	Nice
2015-10-14 18:51:07	ScruffyChat	That's certainly the way to go about thinking of it; using real animals as inspiration
2015-10-14 18:51:42	ScruffyChat	If you need a new region boss for Dry Canyon, might I suggest basing it off a bird of prey?
2015-10-14 18:51:47	ScruffyChat	Or maybe a mammal
2015-10-14 18:51:52	ScruffyChat	Like the kangaroo rst
2015-10-14 18:51:54	ScruffyChat	rat*
2015-10-14 18:52:06	ScruffyChat	It can make big bounds around desert ground
2015-10-14 18:52:25	ScruffyChat	It likes canyon areas, from what I recall
2015-10-14 18:52:52	ScruffyChat	And it has a gland that extracts all the water from cactus seeds
2015-10-14 18:53:12	ScruffyChat	Well... I don't really know how that could become a boss
2015-10-14 18:53:48	ScruffyChat	But there haven't been many mammal bosses; the Bearded Amprat in P3 showed me there weren't a lot of true mammals period in the Pikmin series
2015-10-14 18:54:01	En_Passant	I realized that too
2015-10-14 18:54:23	ScruffyChat	My theory is that humans like mammals too much; most mammals we think of are cute or easily recognizable
2015-10-14 18:55:04	En_Passant	That sounds plausible, the one we got was a rat which are hated
2015-10-14 18:55:10	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-14 18:55:24	ScruffyChat	And they tried to make it less recognizable/ugly
2015-10-14 18:55:34	ScruffyChat	We also got an ugly mat combined with a moth
2015-10-14 18:55:37	ScruffyChat	bat*
2015-10-14 18:57:08	En_Passant	Those beards were pretty cool, though
2015-10-14 18:57:19	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2015-10-14 18:57:36	ScruffyChat	I mean, people might find its electric face creepy, but I'd take one as a pet
2015-10-14 18:58:10	ScruffyChat	I'd take any of them as pets except the Wraiths
2015-10-14 18:58:22	ScruffyChat	I feel they're a little too intelligent to consider themselves pets
2015-10-14 18:58:52	En_Passant	Also, they're supernatural
2015-10-14 18:59:05	ScruffyChat	Mhmm
2015-10-14 18:59:45	En_Passant	Anyway, the reason I brought it up was because I'd like to flesh out the combat aspect of the game, which P3's bosses started but was mostly wait then attack
2015-10-14 19:00:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 19:00:42	ScruffyChat	I really enjoyed bringing a Fiery Bulblax to water
2015-10-14 19:00:58	ScruffyChat	It was interesting and felt even riskier than normal enemies
2015-10-14 19:01:56	ScruffyChat	But what sort of ideas did you have in mind?
2015-10-14 19:02:37	En_Passant	I'm still developing them, but more things like that, where there are multiple ways to defeat them
2015-10-14 19:04:15	En_Passant	I'd like to have enemies and exploration have a few Pikmin types that are effective against them to increase the effectiveness of planning your groups
2015-10-14 19:04:47	En_Passant	That's also why I'm fine with having 9 types, because you can't just bring an equal amount of each and be sufficiently prepared to take on everything
2015-10-14 19:04:54	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 19:05:20	ScruffyChat	I've been considering having enemies you can't defeat, but incapacitate temporarily
2015-10-14 19:05:26	ScruffyChat	Do you think that's a bad idea?
2015-10-14 19:05:53	En_Passant	Not at all. That's what the Mysterious Life Form was like
2015-10-14 19:06:32	ScruffyChat	Ture
2015-10-14 19:06:35	ScruffyChat	True*
2015-10-14 19:06:55	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-14 19:07:27	ScruffyChat	I think for me that would be armored enemies that could be knocked over with Mushroom Pikmin, but never killed unless they were crushed by a bigger enemy
2015-10-14 19:07:43	En_Passant	Summon Bigger Fish
2015-10-14 19:07:47	En_Passant	That's good strategy
2015-10-14 19:07:49	ScruffyChat	Which could produce an interesting puzzle of "You have to lead one enemy to kill another"
2015-10-14 19:08:00	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 19:09:05	ScruffyChat	Well let's see, if you want a dynamic boss battle, I'd think it'd be good to combine animals
2015-10-14 19:09:29	ScruffyChat	To start with
2015-10-14 19:09:42	ScruffyChat	Then think how to deal with each boss on its own
2015-10-14 19:09:54	ScruffyChat	And how the two combined would produce some potential third method
2015-10-14 19:11:42	En_Passant	I think I could incorporate that into the Mawfish, actually
2015-10-14 19:12:11	En_Passant	When you fight it, you have Red, Orange, and Yellow Pikmin
2015-10-14 19:12:55	En_Passant	Red Pikmin are more powerful, Orange Pikmin dig it out of the ground faster (that's what you need to do to immobilize it), and Yellow Pikmin go farther so they have more opportunity to dig
2015-10-14 19:13:19	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 19:14:45	ScruffyChat	So would it have moments where it's still enough to dig it out of the sand?
2015-10-14 19:15:41	En_Passant	Where what's still enough?
2015-10-14 19:16:00	ScruffyChat	I mean "motionless enough"
2015-10-14 19:16:06	En_Passant	Oh
2015-10-14 19:16:20	En_Passant	Yeah, after it leaps it's more vulnerable
2015-10-14 19:16:26	ScruffyChat	Ah I see
2015-10-14 19:16:41	En_Passant	I'd like to avoid having it be invulnerable except for predefined periods of time
2015-10-14 19:16:53	En_Passant	The Scornet Maestro fight was ruined by that
2015-10-14 19:17:04	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 19:17:15	ScruffyChat	Really the Sandbelching Meerslug was the same way
2015-10-14 19:17:28	ScruffyChat	The boss fight largely consists of waiting for it to attack
2015-10-14 19:18:35	ScruffyChat	I love the idea of dynamic terrain though

2015-10-14 20:38:34	@Espyo	working on it right now
2015-10-14 20:38:46	@Espyo	stop mind-reading btw
2015-10-14 20:39:12	@J	I can't help it
2015-10-14 20:39:17	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Olimonck6.png why do we have this
2015-10-14 20:39:28	@J	user image I guess
2015-10-14 20:39:35	Yoshi2	I've started work on a new mini programming project
2015-10-14 20:39:36	@J	platypus olimar
2015-10-14 20:39:51	Yoshi2	it's so difficult to keep working on a single big project
2015-10-14 20:40:03	Yoshi2	it eventually becomes rather boring :/
2015-10-14 20:40:15	@J	what are you doing?
2015-10-14 20:40:25	@Espyo	platypus?
2015-10-14 20:40:34	@Espyo	you saw anything except "hell" in that thing?
2015-10-14 20:40:38	@J	the beak/nose thing just reminds me of one
2015-10-14 20:40:41	@Espyo	Yoshi2: definitely
2015-10-14 20:40:54	@Espyo	I've been deleting irrelevant images today
2015-10-14 20:40:58	@Espyo	but I couldn't bring myself to delete that one
2015-10-14 20:41:26	@J	I'm doing exactly the same, actually - I was working on designing a game plus learning stuff to use for it for a while
2015-10-14 20:41:44	@J	now I think I'll spend some time on writing some parts of a web browser
2015-10-14 20:41:55	Yoshi2	J: I made a function that takes a string formated in a speicifc way, and parses it into number-word pairs
2015-10-14 20:41:58	Yoshi2	https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/6d2bf0965fa3890ce715
2015-10-14 20:42:02	@J	eg. history management, bookmarks
2015-10-14 20:42:15	Yoshi2	and I will use that to extend the memo function of my irc bot
2015-10-14 20:42:22	@J	oh, when you say mini, you really do mean mini
2015-10-14 20:42:44	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Forum:Beautiful_Olimar there
2015-10-14 20:42:47	@Espyo	no need to delete the image now
2015-10-14 20:42:54	Yoshi2	so that you can specifiy how long from now on the memo should be sent to the receiver
2015-10-14 20:43:06	@J	wow, I only looked at the thumbnail before
2015-10-14 20:43:11	@J	at full size, it's...
2015-10-14 20:43:17	@Espyo	detailed, eh?
2015-10-14 20:43:22	@J	painful
2015-10-14 20:43:38	@Espyo	oh yeah

2015-10-14 20:44:25	@Espyo	neat, a finite state machine
2015-10-14 20:44:27	@J	so you mean stuff like '1000 seconds'?
2015-10-14 20:44:33	@J	@Yoshi2
2015-10-14 20:44:43	Yoshi2	yup
2015-10-14 20:44:45	@J	'3 days, 2 hours'
2015-10-14 20:45:08	Yoshi2	except in my case the string would look like 3days,4hours
2015-10-14 20:45:16	Yoshi2	or just 3days4hours
2015-10-14 20:46:24	@J	it wouldn't work with spaces?
2015-10-14 20:46:33	@J	I mean, you'd split words beforehand?
2015-10-14 20:47:03	@Espyo	now you extend this into crazy lengths
2015-10-14 20:47:12	Yoshi2	the way commands on my bot work is that the message is broken up into parameters at spaces
2015-10-14 20:47:17	@Espyo	--spaceignore to ignore spaces
2015-10-14 20:47:21	@Espyo	--spacekeep to keep them
2015-10-14 20:47:35	@J	support 'the day before last Christmas' and 'next leap day'
2015-10-14 20:47:45	@Espyo	--assertspace to break if it detects a space
2015-10-14 20:47:48	Yoshi2	oh god no
2015-10-14 20:47:54	@Espyo	you know you want to
2015-10-14 20:48:04	@J	Wolfram Alpha probably does those I guess
2015-10-14 20:48:36	@J	no, it doesn't know leap day
2015-10-14 20:48:42	@J	it does get the other one
2015-10-14 20:49:00	Yoshi2	wolfram alpha also has a lot more people working on it who have the knowledge and the time to deal with that

2015-10-14 21:16:34	@Espyo	it should save a bitmap on the same folder as the .exes
2015-10-14 21:16:44	ScruffyChat	What does F3 do on Windows
2015-10-14 21:16:48	ScruffyChat	It's not the same on Mac
2015-10-14 21:16:50	@Espyo	anything you tell it to
2015-10-14 21:16:52	@Espyo	darn
2015-10-14 21:16:57	@Espyo	in that case let me remap it to a different key
2015-10-14 21:17:01	@Espyo	plus change which image it'll save
2015-10-14 21:17:05	@Espyo	because it might not work for what I want anyway
2015-10-14 21:17:29	@Espyo	got dinner
2015-10-14 21:17:34	@Espyo	just going to do this real quick and send you it
2015-10-14 21:17:38	ScruffyChat	Ok

2015-10-14 21:53:26	@Espyo	ScruffyChat?
2015-10-14 21:53:38	ScruffyChat	Still trying to figure it out
2015-10-14 21:53:42	ScruffyChat	It hasn't worked yet
2015-10-14 21:53:56	ScruffyChat	I also noticed the background alpha doesn't change
2015-10-14 21:53:57	@Espyo	you just run it like the one that's released on github
2015-10-14 21:54:01	@Espyo	but simply replace the exe
2015-10-14 21:54:23	@Espyo	hm, you mean you're editing the area's text file and the changes aren't going through?

2015-10-14 21:54:50	ScruffyChat	They are, I can change background color
2015-10-14 21:55:07	ScruffyChat	And if I change the name of the image files, it will recognize that it can't find them
2015-10-14 21:55:25	ScruffyChat	But "bg_alpha" doesn't appear to do anything
2015-10-14 21:55:29	@Espyo	right
2015-10-14 21:55:34	@Espyo	oh, that only works for...
2015-10-14 21:55:34	@Espyo	uh
2015-10-14 21:55:36	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-10-14 21:55:38	@Espyo	for the area editor
2015-10-14 21:55:42	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-14 21:55:45	@Espyo	you can place a custom background
2015-10-14 21:55:47	@Espyo	so like a blueprint
2015-10-14 21:55:50	@Espyo	and then work on top of it
2015-10-14 21:55:52	ScruffyChat	Ah I see
2015-10-14 21:55:56	@Espyo	it's SO useful
2015-10-14 21:56:01	@Espyo	makes me sad how so many editors don't have that
2015-10-14 21:56:02	ScruffyChat	I'm sure
2015-10-14 21:56:07	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-14 21:56:15	ScruffyChat	Blender does have something like that though
2015-10-14 21:56:21	@Espyo	oh, that's great
2015-10-14 21:56:27	@Espyo	well, can you run the latest exe then?

2015-10-14 21:56:56	ScruffyChat	Yes, but everything that's not a sprite is still black
2015-10-14 21:57:03	ScruffyChat	Except for the bridge and the shadows
2015-10-14 21:57:03	@Espyo	right
2015-10-14 21:57:08	@Espyo	oh, right
2015-10-14 21:57:11	@Espyo	I never told you what key to press
2015-10-14 21:57:13	@Espyo	press P
2015-10-14 21:57:19	@Espyo	it should create the image I mentioned before
2015-10-14 21:57:44	ScruffyChat	Yes, it appears to be a png of one of the area edges
2015-10-14 21:57:57	ScruffyChat	Nothing else, just the shadow of the wall
2015-10-14 21:58:22	@Espyo	so you don't see textures there either?
2015-10-14 21:58:26	ScruffyChat	No
2015-10-14 21:58:30	@Espyo	ok, that's helpful
2015-10-14 21:58:38	@Espyo	means that it's not a problem drawing the ground
2015-10-14 21:58:42	@Espyo	it's a problem with creating it
2015-10-14 21:59:12	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 22:02:44	ScruffyChat	In all the linedefs, what do "s" and "v" represent?
2015-10-14 22:13:50	@Espyo	s is the sectors on each side of the linedef

2015-10-14 22:14:11	@Espyo	if you know Doom level-making, it's pretty much the exact same
2015-10-14 22:14:16	@Espyo	if not, it can be overwhelming
2015-10-14 22:15:18	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 22:15:28	ScruffyChat	I didn't know the day starts over, that's neat
2015-10-14 22:16:18	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-14 22:16:24	@Espyo	it didn't make sense for me to make it that way
2015-10-14 22:16:27	@Espyo	but I love adding details
2015-10-14 22:16:36	@Espyo	plus I never know if somebody wants to make a Pikmin game with no end-of-day
2015-10-14 22:16:40	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 22:17:10	ScruffyChat	I've been trying to open the open area editor but to no avail
2015-10-14 22:17:17	ScruffyChat	I'm no good with Wine
2015-10-14 22:17:35	@Espyo	hmm
2015-10-14 22:17:39	@Espyo	I'll make a small hack for you
2015-10-14 22:17:46	@Espyo	since the exes I'm sending are all hack-filled to try to figure this out
2015-10-14 22:19:53	ScruffyChat	I'm sure if I tried this on a windows it'd be fine
2015-10-14 22:20:01	ScruffyChat	I can't imagine what Wine is failing to see
2015-10-14 22:20:21	@Espyo	dunno
2015-10-14 22:23:44	ScruffyChat	What did you use to create the game initially?
2015-10-14 22:24:21	@Espyo	initially?
2015-10-14 22:24:40	@Espyo	what I started with is what I still have
2015-10-14 22:24:46	@Espyo	C++ running the Allegro library
2015-10-14 22:24:55	@Espyo	library takes care of creating the window, drawing the graphics, playing audio, etc.

2015-10-14 22:26:13	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-14 22:27:31	@Espyo	oh, last hour's episode?
2015-10-14 22:27:35	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-10-14 22:27:36	@Espyo	I see them like 10 hours later

2015-10-14 22:29:53	@Espyo	and let me know if it spits anything to Error_log.txt
2015-10-14 22:30:09	@Espyo	it'll either write nothing new, or thousands of things
2015-10-14 22:30:11	@Espyo	one of the two
2015-10-14 22:32:46	ScruffyChat	Wrote nothing
2015-10-14 22:33:05	@Espyo	darn
2015-10-14 22:33:10	@Espyo	well, that one has a hack to open the area editor
2015-10-14 22:33:13	@Espyo	open Options.txt
2015-10-14 22:33:19	@Espyo	particle_quality=2
2015-10-14 22:33:25	@Espyo	change to 0 for the animation editor, 1 for the area editor
2015-10-14 22:33:32	@Espyo	I don't think the particle quality option is even used
2015-10-14 22:34:40	ScruffyChat	Umm
2015-10-14 22:34:47	ScruffyChat	Animation editor and area editor aren't options
2015-10-14 22:35:45	ScruffyChat	They're still batch scripts here, but they don't appear in Options.txt
2015-10-14 22:37:03	@Espyo	you edit particle_quality
2015-10-14 22:37:12	@Espyo	that particle_quality should be inside Options.txt
2015-10-14 22:38:33	ScruffyChat	Ohhhh
2015-10-14 22:38:51	ScruffyChat	Yay that works
2015-10-14 22:39:58	@Espyo	yay
2015-10-14 22:40:07	@Espyo	oh, on the area editor, can you try what I said the other day?
2015-10-14 22:40:15	ScruffyChat	I forget
2015-10-14 22:40:15	@Espyo	press Review, and tick the show textures box
2015-10-14 22:40:38	ScruffyChat	how do you get to Review
2015-10-14 22:41:02	@Espyo	click on the only button to select an area
2015-10-14 22:41:11	@Espyo	pick Play (is it the only option there?)
2015-10-14 22:41:19	@Espyo	then you get the main menu buttons; one of them's Review
2015-10-14 22:42:14	ScruffyChat	The shadows of the edges show up, but no textures
2015-10-14 22:42:20	@Espyo	hmmmmmmm...
2015-10-14 23:00:51	@Espyo	going to try one more thing before I call it a day

2015-10-14 23:05:08	@Espyo	can you see textures with this?
2015-10-14 23:10:18	ScruffyChat	I can see some white spaces
2015-10-14 23:11:06	ScruffyChat	And the error log says Texture is null! 3 times

2015-10-14 23:42:56	ScruffyChat	Well something about the textures appeared to change at least
2015-10-14 23:43:11	ScruffyChat	I can see the ring around the Cloaking Burrow-nit
2015-10-14 23:48:51	@Espyo	ring...?
2015-10-14 23:48:54	@Espyo	oh
2015-10-14 23:49:00	@Espyo	uh... odd
2015-10-14 23:49:03	@Espyo	very odd
2015-10-14 23:49:20	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 23:49:57	ScruffyChat	And the white areas show up in the bitmap
2015-10-14 23:50:34	ScruffyChat	It's just that ring and then a little parallelogram to the south of it, in a corner
2015-10-14 23:51:56	ScruffyChat	I have to go though

2015-10-14 23:52:39	@Espyo	it's okay
2015-10-14 23:52:51	@Espyo	the other problem I had with mipmaps a long time ago?
2015-10-14 23:52:58	@Espyo	that was because OpenGL was handling the mipmaps in one way
2015-10-14 23:52:59	ScruffyChat	Mhmm?
2015-10-14 23:53:08	@Espyo	and DirectX (windows) was handling them another way
2015-10-14 23:53:17	@Espyo	that's why me and J had to go back-and-forth like this trying to figure it out
2015-10-14 23:53:23	@Espyo	so this episode can only be similar
2015-10-14 23:53:25	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-14 23:53:36	ScruffyChat	Did you eventually solve it though?
2015-10-14 23:53:41	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-14 23:53:42	@Espyo	all good now

2015-10-14 23:54:01	@Espyo	sorry again
2015-10-14 23:54:04	ScruffyChat	Oh it's no trouble, I'm happy to help
2015-10-14 23:54:10	@Espyo	but I'll try to push the other guy on Pikipedia to try it on Wine too
2015-10-14 23:54:13	ScruffyChat	It's a really great engine
2015-10-14 23:54:15	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-14 23:54:15	@Espyo	if it works for him, I guess I'll tone it down here
2015-10-14 23:54:16	@Espyo	thanks
2015-10-14 23:54:22	@Espyo	but if it fails for him too, I'll have to try to fix it
2015-10-14 23:54:26	@Espyo	so more people can experience it right
2015-10-14 23:54:31	@Espyo	probably a simple solution anyway
2015-10-14 23:54:34	@Espyo	finding it's the hard part

2015-10-15 19:42:00	Yoshi2	sounds about right
2015-10-15 20:49:36	@Espyo	>To Espyo, I meant to say "first, after it arrived after waiting for five minutes, and after the cutscene, because of the Instant Kill code (Pressing Z + 2 on the Wiimote beforehand), it died after the rollers fell apart, shortly after the cutscene of its' arrival (the one the Ship mentions about it having a physical form elsewhere) and had dropped the Noisemaker."
2015-10-15 20:49:39	@Espyo	still doesn't make sense...

2015-10-15 20:58:45	@Espyo	yeah, it's so confusing

2015-10-15 22:31:53	ScruffyChat	I'm thinking it's no longer a Snavian, or even an animal
2015-10-15 22:32:02	ScruffyChat	What you're fighting is a fungus
2015-10-15 22:32:14	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-15 22:32:22	ScruffyChat	A rust fungus, technically, but it sort of combines parts of all sorts of fungi
2015-10-15 22:32:35	@PikFan	well, that would certainly highlight its parasitism
2015-10-15 22:32:45	ScruffyChat	Indeed
2015-10-15 22:32:59	ScruffyChat	I thought that the final boss would actually be an Onion that has been infected with it

2015-10-15 22:33:31	@PikFan	...oh!
2015-10-15 22:33:44	@PikFan	this could tie in with Puffstools VERY nicely...wait

2015-10-15 22:33:59	@PikFan	ugh, somebody already did a Puffstool final boss

2015-10-15 22:34:06	ScruffyChat	It's ok
2015-10-15 22:34:11	ScruffyChat	This'll be different
2015-10-15 22:34:23	ScruffyChat	I want to emphasize its non-animal-ness
2015-10-15 22:34:28	@PikFan	right
2015-10-15 22:34:42	@PikFan	also, I was thinking, could I use the Arachlord in my game?
2015-10-15 22:34:51	ScruffyChat	Absolutely!
2015-10-15 22:34:55	ScruffyChat	Go for it
2015-10-15 22:34:56	@PikFan	yay, thanks
2015-10-15 22:35:17	@PikFan	hm, maybe the Arachlord could be the true final boss
2015-10-15 22:35:21	ScruffyChat	But I was thinking Edward, like Olimar, might be saved from impact by an Onion that thinks he's Olimar
2015-10-15 22:35:37	ScruffyChat	(DELTA isn't saved because she's not technically alive)
2015-10-15 22:35:44	@PikFan	hmmm
2015-10-15 22:35:56	ScruffyChat	And Edward is safely returned to the Pikmin tree in the Onion
2015-10-15 22:36:16	ScruffyChat	But the fungus infecting the tree sporulates, and the Onion is infected, sealing Edward inside

2015-10-16 21:13:46	ScruffyChat	I said afterwards that Scutterchucks were introduced early in P3
2015-10-16 21:13:56	En_Passant	But still after Rock Pikmin
2015-10-16 21:13:56	ScruffyChat	Maybe new Beebs could have a jumping attack
2015-10-16 21:14:01	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-16 21:14:18	En_Passant	A jumping attack might work, though I don't know how that would kill
2015-10-16 21:14:37	En_Passant	I'm thinking Tektite jumps

2015-10-16 21:16:53	En_Passant	I could make both, actually
2015-10-16 21:17:04	En_Passant	Have the second one appear later and be Crawbster-like
2015-10-16 21:17:10	En_Passant	I liked that boss
2015-10-16 21:17:16	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-16 21:18:10	ScruffyChat	How about Leaplouse?
2015-10-16 21:18:29	En_Passant	Eh
2015-10-16 21:18:36	En_Passant	It's just leap + louse
2015-10-16 21:18:40	ScruffyChat	I know

2015-10-16 21:18:59	ScruffyChat	Or vice versa
2015-10-16 21:19:45	ScruffyChat	And eventually it turns into gibberish
2015-10-16 21:21:43	ScruffyChat	If you wanted it to be like a pill bug, a good ecological adjective for it would be ''conglobing''
2015-10-16 21:25:20	ScruffyChat	Like, Conglobing Smidge, or something to that effect
2015-10-16 21:25:37	ScruffyChat	Smidge sounds like a thinner animal than the one we're describing though
2015-10-16 21:25:52	ScruffyChat	And plus that's an actual word, never mind

2015-10-17 14:58:51	Klemen702	that was a long wait for espyo...
2015-10-17 15:04:49	@J	yeah, should've just asked the question then and I would be able to answer now
2015-10-17 15:09:47	@Espyo	not so much a question as it is a big thing
2015-10-17 15:10:03	@Espyo	this guy on wikia is telling me off from inviting people away from wikia and onto Pikipedia
2015-10-17 15:10:16	@Espyo	he sounds like a twat
2015-10-17 15:10:23	@Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:23459
2015-10-17 15:10:26	@Espyo	I'm going to reply to him
2015-10-17 15:10:29	@Espyo	I'll keep it civilized
2015-10-17 15:10:33	@Espyo	but I want to hear your take on it too
2015-10-17 15:10:37	@Espyo	and no, I won't stop inviting people over
2015-10-17 15:11:04	@Espyo	risk wikia growing? risk having another split community? have people's contributions actually go to waste? not advising people to leave the inferior wiki?
2015-10-17 15:11:08	@Espyo	I shall do none of that
2015-10-17 15:11:12	@Espyo	he better have another thing coming
2015-10-17 15:11:23	@Espyo	let me reread it as well
2015-10-17 15:11:26	@Espyo	didn't give it much of a read yesterday
2015-10-17 15:13:10	@Espyo	ok, so he basically says three things
2015-10-17 15:13:23	@Espyo	one: the idea of us moving shouldn't make sense because in the real world, there is such a thing as competition
2015-10-17 15:13:25	@Espyo	which is true
2015-10-17 15:13:28	@Espyo	but this isn't about competition
2015-10-17 15:13:38	@Espyo	this is about us being the only people on the "market" that do Pikmin
2015-10-17 15:13:45	@Espyo	Pikmin Wikia and Pikipedia are our products
2015-10-17 15:13:48	@Espyo	and one of them is outdated
2015-10-17 15:13:53	@Espyo	we're telling people to use the newer version
2015-10-17 15:13:55	@Espyo	not the same thing
2015-10-17 15:14:02	@Espyo	he also compares it to a town only having one hospital
2015-10-17 15:14:04	@Espyo	that's retarded
2015-10-17 15:14:17	@Espyo	next, he says that time spent telling people to leave is time I'm not spending helping Pikipedia
2015-10-17 15:14:27	@Espyo	because 3+ hours of work a day compare to a 1-minute message
2015-10-17 15:14:41	@Espyo	plus the profit of having people join outweighs any time I spent asking people
2015-10-17 15:14:54	@Espyo	finally, he tries to be fancy and point out the Streisand effect
2015-10-17 15:14:59	@Espyo	except that only works if you say something without reason
2015-10-17 15:15:04	Klemen702	dat
2015-10-17 15:15:05	Klemen702	is dumb
2015-10-17 15:15:06	@Espyo	like "hey, leave this wikia and come to Pikipedia, thanks!"
2015-10-17 15:15:11	@Espyo	that would be the Streisand effect
2015-10-17 15:15:14	@Espyo	which is not what I do
2015-10-17 15:15:19	@Espyo	I explain this wikia is abandoned and all
2015-10-17 15:15:26	@Espyo	so... nothing of his reasoning holds any water
2015-10-17 15:15:33	@Espyo	I'll kindly tell him off
2015-10-17 15:15:38	@Espyo	and hope he shuts up
2015-10-17 15:15:42	@J	well that's a lot of text
2015-10-17 15:15:50	@Espyo	he's got a "WIKIA STAR" tag on his user page
2015-10-17 15:15:56	@Espyo	so he's either a deluded fanboy
2015-10-17 15:16:03	@Espyo	or wikia staff nudged him towards telling me off
2015-10-17 15:17:39	Klemen702	i didn't think
2015-10-17 15:17:44	Klemen702	that wikia would care about this wiki
2015-10-17 15:17:53	Klemen702	it looks like a small thing 
2015-10-17 15:18:01	Klemen702	the existence of the wikia that is
2015-10-17 15:18:11	@Espyo	they might not really care much
2015-10-17 15:18:16	@Espyo	it's just this idiot thinking he's a white knight
2015-10-17 15:20:15	@J	yeah, there's some weird arguments
2015-10-17 15:20:23	@J	[15:14:17] @Espyo next, he says that time spent telling people to leave is time I'm not spending helping
2015-10-17 15:20:23	@J	Pikipedia
2015-10-17 15:20:45	@J	this part is fair enough - it's more than just a minute, it's just the distraction as a whole
2015-10-17 15:20:49	@J	like this conversation right now
2015-10-17 15:21:00	@J	it's not the whole story, of course
2015-10-17 15:21:09	@Espyo	but it's still worth it
2015-10-17 15:21:21	@Espyo	it's like arguing the time I spent turning on my computer isn't worth it
2015-10-17 15:21:28	@Espyo	to strive, we need people's help
2015-10-17 15:21:41	@Espyo	Pikipedia's progress isn't just "Espyo's edits"
2015-10-17 15:21:49	@Espyo	it's community growth, idea sharing, etc.
2015-10-17 15:22:03	Klemen702	^^
2015-10-17 15:22:06	@Espyo	if it were only for the purpose of driving people away from wikia, and not related to Pikipedia
2015-10-17 15:22:09	@Espyo	then yes, it would be a waste
2015-10-17 15:22:17	@Espyo	even if I just copy-pasted a pre-written message and took 10 seconds
2015-10-17 15:22:22	@Espyo	it wouldn't be much of a waste, but it would
2015-10-17 15:22:24	@Espyo	but in this case, it isn't
2015-10-17 15:22:32	@J	you'll notice very wiki listed on the guy's user page is a Wikia wiki
2015-10-17 15:22:42	@Espyo	*every?
2015-10-17 15:23:02	@J	yeah
2015-10-17 15:23:15	@Espyo	well, like I said, the "WIKIA STAR" tag he has
2015-10-17 15:23:21	@Espyo	I doubt he'd go around listing non-wikia wikis
2015-10-17 15:23:31	@J	I don't even know what that means
2015-10-17 15:23:45	@Espyo	no idea either
2015-10-17 15:23:53	@Espyo	but it might be some mark of recognition granted by the system
2015-10-17 15:24:00	@Espyo	because he contributes greatly on so many wikias
2015-10-17 15:24:50	@Espyo	for somebody with his experience, he knows how we're trying to strive to be a great wiki
2015-10-17 15:25:06	@Espyo	so he's not sending this message to tell me off
2015-10-17 15:25:08	Klemen702	could he have been sent by someone from wikia?
2015-10-17 15:25:11	Klemen702	or is he just a fan?
2015-10-17 15:25:17	@Espyo	it's either wikia telling him to, or he's just a fan
2015-10-17 15:25:19	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2015-10-17 15:25:21	@Espyo	either of the two
2015-10-17 15:25:21	@J	the part about hospitals being owned by companies made me shudder a little, but that's a different topic entirely
2015-10-17 15:25:24	@Espyo	heck, or both
2015-10-17 15:25:30	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-17 15:26:29	@J	anyway, I don't know
2015-10-17 15:26:33	@J	don't be too mean, I guess
2015-10-17 15:26:38	@Espyo	I won't
2015-10-17 15:26:45	@Espyo	not really aiming for it
2015-10-17 15:26:55	@Espyo	one thing is explaining to him why what he's saying seems a bit misguided
2015-10-17 15:26:56	@J	don't say too much either, it makes it feel more like an attack and less of your actual points will get through
2015-10-17 15:27:04	@Espyo	another is showing off that Pikipedia folk are self-entitled pricks
2015-10-17 15:27:10	@Espyo	hm, right
2015-10-17 15:28:48	@Espyo	uhm
2015-10-17 15:28:53	@Espyo	what do you call the market competition thing?
2015-10-17 15:29:08	@Espyo	like when only one company does X, they can be as evil as they want because there's no competition
2015-10-17 15:29:19	@Espyo	whereas multiple companies try to improve themselves to best the competition?
2015-10-17 15:29:32	Klemen702	just read it
2015-10-17 15:29:36	Klemen702	sounds like a dick :P
2015-10-17 15:29:37	Testyo	Only Mario Kart Wii can induce such language.
2015-10-17 15:29:44	@Espyo	...wow that's old
2015-10-17 15:29:50	@Espyo	Splatoon is the biggest rage-inducing game of the moment
2015-10-17 15:29:54	@Espyo	heh, Mario Kart Wii...
2015-10-17 15:30:26	Klemen702	is mario kart wii hard or bad? :P
2015-10-17 15:30:35	@Espyo	unfair, mostly

2015-10-17 15:30:49	@Espyo	a blue shell comes your way
2015-10-17 15:30:54	@Espyo	followed by a red shell

2015-10-17 15:31:15	@Espyo	and your skill is rewarded with you landing in flat last at the last second
2015-10-17 15:31:19	@J	can't remember, actually
2015-10-17 15:31:24	@J	AFK for 30 minutes or so

2015-10-17 15:42:02	Testyo	I said yeah... nope because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages yeah... and nope.

2015-10-17 16:13:21	@Espyo	waiting for more feedback

2015-10-17 16:32:58	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/radar_bg.gtx.png -> in-game texture
2015-10-17 16:32:58	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/3/37/KopPad_map_background.png -> texture I made for the wiki
2015-10-17 16:34:59	Klemen702	what will it be used for?
2015-10-17 16:38:41	@Espyo	the one on the wiki is already used on the KopPad theme
2015-10-17 16:38:52	@Espyo	I made that one like a year ago
2015-10-17 16:38:54	@Espyo	before we had textures
2015-10-17 16:39:00	Klemen702	k
2015-10-17 16:39:01	@Espyo	now that I do, I just posted the two of them to compare
2015-10-17 16:39:05	@Espyo	kind of similar, I like how well I did
2015-10-17 16:39:10	@Espyo	not like it was hard, but still
2015-10-17 16:39:23	Klemen702	so will it be replaced?
2015-10-17 16:39:31	@Espyo	hm, not sure
2015-10-17 16:39:39	@Espyo	the current image works fine
2015-10-17 16:39:50	@Espyo	so we could minimize the troubles by not having a copyrighted texture
2015-10-17 16:39:53	@Espyo	but we already have quite a few textures
2015-10-17 16:40:27	Klemen702	how about
2015-10-17 16:40:39	Klemen702	you remove the top and the left part of the actual picture
2015-10-17 16:40:44	Klemen702	so it's higher quality
2015-10-17 16:41:07	@Espyo	you mean the thick lines?
2015-10-17 16:41:10	@Espyo	those are meant to exist
2015-10-17 16:41:42	Klemen702	what?
2015-10-17 16:41:58	@Espyo	I'm not sure what part of the image you're thinking of removing

2015-10-17 16:46:12	@J	that still looks long, Espyo
2015-10-17 16:46:15	@J	not that I read it
2015-10-17 16:46:24	@Espyo	I know, but I can't shorten it any more...
2015-10-17 16:46:34	@Espyo	anyway, I'm pretty sure I was pretty objective
2015-10-17 16:46:41	@J	well, you don't have to address every point
2015-10-17 16:46:47	@J	just say how you feel overall
2015-10-17 16:47:00	@Espyo	he'll just find ways to hammer those points anyway
2015-10-17 16:47:02	@Espyo	it's how it always goes
2015-10-17 16:47:04	@J	but if you want to, of course just go for it
2015-10-17 16:47:16	@J	I will try to find some popcorn
2015-10-17 16:47:36	@Espyo	I'd ask for some, but I've got the whole show to play out
2015-10-17 16:47:53	@J	maybe don't link to monopoly, it's somewhat patronising
2015-10-17 16:48:01	@J	if it's not too late
2015-10-17 16:48:03	@Espyo	he linked to the streisand effect
2015-10-17 16:48:09	@Espyo	(not too late)
2015-10-17 16:48:09	@J	so let him be patronising
2015-10-17 16:48:13	@Espyo	hmm
2015-10-17 16:48:15	@Espyo	good point
2015-10-17 16:49:21	@J	anyway, yeah, the point is there's no point in two wikis with exactly the same goal
2015-10-17 16:49:31	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-17 16:49:34	@J	now if they aimed to cover the content differently, fine
2015-10-17 16:49:40	@Espyo	yes
2015-10-17 16:49:44	@Espyo	wouldn't be nice, but yes
2015-10-17 16:49:50	@Espyo	it's weird
2015-10-17 16:49:53	@J	but the only difference is one wants to be hosted independently
2015-10-17 16:49:59	@Espyo	the guy could have just told me I'm going against wikia's rules
2015-10-17 16:50:06	@Espyo	and I would be forced to shut up, because there's no real argument
2015-10-17 16:50:11	@Espyo	instead, he goes about with stupid arguments
2015-10-17 16:51:03	@J	I would also suggest that your goal here might better be to get the guy to like you, to see that you're not the enemy
2015-10-17 16:51:11	@J	rather than publicly beat the guy at an argument
2015-10-17 16:51:28	@Espyo	well, sure, but the two will be hard to get across at once
2015-10-17 16:51:37	@Espyo	I guess my last paragraph helps in that regard
2015-10-17 16:51:39	@J	I think that's how you got the wikis to merge before
2015-10-17 16:51:47	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-10-17 16:52:01	@Espyo	hmm, I'll try a different answer
2015-10-17 16:52:13	@Espyo	short and focuses more on trying to let us be
2015-10-17 16:52:17	@Espyo	but doesn't really respond to the points
2015-10-17 16:52:17	@J	it's something that really comes up all the time in every part of life
2015-10-17 16:52:25	@Espyo	so if he's an analytical type of guy, he'll tell us off anyway
2015-10-17 16:52:44	@Espyo	yeah, and I'm trying to change my way of acting to think a bit more before acting
2015-10-17 16:52:46	@Espyo	and try to default to being nicer
2015-10-17 16:52:49	@J	if there's a group of people you're not associated with, your instinct is to dislike them for no reason
2015-10-17 16:52:54	@Espyo	and I'm making some progress for that
2015-10-17 16:52:57	@Espyo	so I better not destroy that here
2015-10-17 16:52:58	@J	it's not something you decide, it just happens
2015-10-17 16:53:14	@J	and it's really hard to avoid falling into that
2015-10-17 16:53:41	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-17 16:53:46	@Espyo	uh, good thing I didn't send anything yet
2015-10-17 16:53:48	@Espyo	I misspelled his name |:

2015-10-17 16:53:53	@J	nice job
2015-10-17 16:54:08	@J	I hope you didn't typo an insult into it
2015-10-17 16:54:10	@Espyo	it's like
2015-10-17 16:54:13	@Espyo	the one thing you shouldn't do
2015-10-17 16:54:25	@Espyo	thanks
2015-10-17 16:54:28	@Espyo	now instead of typing a reply
2015-10-17 16:54:39	@Espyo	I'm busy thinking of what positive words can become negative with a letter swap
2015-10-17 16:54:41	@J	yes
2015-10-17 16:54:41	@Espyo	how constructive

2015-10-17 16:58:02	Yoshi2	that would be the icing on the cake
2015-10-17 16:59:52	@Espyo	hey, I can do some manipulation here
2015-10-17 17:00:00	@Espyo	make it sound like the things he's saying are actually tips to help us
2015-10-17 17:00:03	@Espyo	like the Streisand effect?
2015-10-17 17:00:19	@Espyo	I'll use what he said as making it sound like he's helping us minimize the effect
2015-10-17 17:02:19	Yoshi2	as long as it can't be picked up as some sort of sarcasm
2015-10-17 17:02:36	@Espyo	no, it's actually starting to be a bit heartfelt
2015-10-17 17:02:50	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/wikia%20reply%202.txt
2015-10-17 17:04:06	@Espyo	yeah, maybe we're misreading this
2015-10-17 17:04:09	@Espyo	he's not really telling us to stop
2015-10-17 17:04:17	@Espyo	he's telling us what he thinks is best for Pikipedia
2015-10-17 17:04:26	@Espyo	"if you really want to help your wiki yadda yadda"
2015-10-17 18:24:50	@Espyo	oh, you never replied

2015-10-17 18:34:45	@Espyo	oh
2015-10-17 18:34:52	@J	'precisely as to' was meant to be 'so as to' or just 'to'?
2015-10-17 18:34:52	@Espyo	I was probably thinking of "bringing downfall" or something

2015-10-17 18:36:10	@J	'
2015-10-17 18:36:16	@J	just isn't right
2015-10-17 18:36:20	@Espyo	hmm
2015-10-17 18:36:26	@J	should be 'precisely so as to' or 'precisely to'
2015-10-17 18:36:26	@Espyo	"precisely to minimize" would be the way
2015-10-17 18:36:34	@Espyo	"precisely so as to" seems very wrong
2015-10-17 18:36:44	@Espyo	yeah, all good now
2015-10-17 18:38:53	@J	it's okay, just less common
2015-10-17 18:39:26	@J	'so as to' is pretty much the same as 'in order to'
2015-10-17 18:40:32	@Espyo	right, but with "precisely" before, it just seems wrong

2015-10-17 20:10:11	@Espyo	[20:09:14] André Silva - Espoopyo: the different rooms aren't in the same distances you find them in-game
2015-10-17 20:10:11	@Espyo	[20:09:19] André Silva - Espoopyo: because each room is a different file
2015-10-17 20:10:11	@Espyo	[20:09:32] André Silva - Espoopyo: and instead of trying to see where they fit with the naked eye, I'd rather just press them together

2015-10-18 13:58:13	Yoshi2	SO MUCH
2015-10-18 13:58:15	Yoshi2	wrong with that
2015-10-18 14:00:19	Yoshi2	a wiki is supposed to be a community effort

2015-10-18 15:22:17	@Espyo	the windows command line is so cancerous
2015-10-18 15:22:29	@Espyo	I created a simple batch script that feeds a file to a program
2015-10-18 15:22:30	@Espyo	oh look
2015-10-18 15:22:32	@Espyo	it doesn't work
2015-10-18 15:22:36	@Espyo	because the filename has a ^ in it
2015-10-18 15:22:41	@Espyo	and there doesn't seem to be a solution

2015-10-18 15:30:26	Yoshi2	Espyo: and you can't do anything to escape it?
2015-10-18 15:30:35	@Espyo	I am going to cry
2015-10-18 15:30:36	@Espyo	or die
2015-10-18 15:30:38	@Espyo	one of the two
2015-10-18 15:30:39	@Espyo	maybe both
2015-10-18 15:30:49	@Espyo	the idea would be for you to be able to open the file with the batch script
2015-10-18 15:30:54	@Espyo	which is something I've done countless times
2015-10-18 15:31:05	@Espyo	but the file gets passed onto the script with the caret
2015-10-18 15:31:12	@Espyo	and instantly gets parsed as if the caret is an escape character
2015-10-18 15:31:23	@Espyo	I don't think there's anything inside the script I can do to "unescape" it
2015-10-18 15:31:40	@Espyo	if I typed it manually from the command line, maybe it wouldn't be that big of a deal
2015-10-18 15:31:50	@Espyo	I'd just have to write THREE CARETS BEFORE THE ORIGINAL CARET IN THE FILENAME
2015-10-18 15:32:03	@Espyo	it's perfectly ridiculous, but at least it'd WORK
2015-10-18 15:32:14	@Espyo	but I'm not writing it manually
2015-10-18 15:45:23	@Espyo	it's...
2015-10-18 15:45:24	@Espyo	not...
2015-10-18 15:45:26	@Espyo	possible...
2015-10-18 15:45:34	@Espyo	it's just literally an impossibility under windows, it seems
2015-10-18 15:45:45	@Espyo	instead of making a script to run the file
2015-10-18 15:45:52	@Espyo	I'll make a script to run a folder
2015-10-18 15:45:59	@Espyo	luckily the program behind the script accepts folders
2015-10-18 15:46:03	@Espyo	but if it didn't
2015-10-18 15:46:09	@Espyo	I think I'd have a mental breakdown
2015-10-18 15:46:12	@Espyo	this is
2015-10-18 15:46:18	@Espyo	without a doubt
2015-10-18 15:46:24	@Espyo	something that should not be allowed on an operative system
2015-10-18 15:47:05	Yoshi2	I like the windows command line
2015-10-18 15:47:22	Yoshi2	as long as I don't have to do anything more complicated than executing a program with a few parameters
2015-10-18 15:47:38	Testyo	not sure this article is really necessary, but a summary
2015-10-18 15:47:55	@Espyo	that's exactly what I tried to do
2015-10-18 15:47:58	@Espyo	not even any parameters
2015-10-18 15:48:05	@Espyo	just execute a batch script using the first argument
2015-10-18 15:48:09	@Espyo	it can't even do that right
2015-10-18 15:49:38	@Espyo	there
2015-10-18 15:49:40	@Espyo	that worked
2015-10-18 15:49:49	@Espyo	I took 2 hours on something that should've taken 2 minutes
2015-10-18 15:50:00	@Espyo	I am out of energy to comment further on this

2015-10-18 17:48:06	@J	ie. without cygwin or putty
2015-10-18 17:48:31	@J	I think Git Bash ships with it nowadays too
2015-10-18 17:49:46	@Espyo	too bad you can't make windows use any of those when running batch files
2015-10-18 17:50:49	@J	hey, just don't use batch files

2015-10-18 17:51:32	@Espyo	you can if you edit the registry
2015-10-18 17:51:40	@J	great usability right there
2015-10-18 17:51:45	@Espyo	luckily Notepad++ adds a "Open with Notepad++" option to the context menu of everything
2015-10-18 17:51:49	@Espyo	otherwise I'd have been driven insane
2015-10-18 17:51:51	@Espyo	again
2015-10-18 17:52:33	Yoshi2	oh yes
2015-10-18 17:53:02	Yoshi2	regular notepad is not very good, to say the least
2015-10-18 17:53:16	@Espyo	it's even less than basic
2015-10-18 17:53:25	@Espyo	it having undo and not having it is almost the same
2015-10-18 17:53:25	@Espyo	eesh
2015-10-18 17:54:10	@J	just don't make any mistakes
2015-10-18 17:54:13	@J	problem solved
2015-10-18 17:54:20	@Espyo	can't argue with that
2015-10-18 17:54:21	Yoshi2	if only life was that easy

2015-10-18 18:06:52	Yoshi2	currently looking through various scientific journals to see if they contain anything useful for my topic
2015-10-18 18:07:06	Yoshi2	I feel like I'll need at least a few days for that
2015-10-18 18:07:18	@Espyo	I bet
2015-10-18 18:09:18	Yoshi2	sadly, I don't have that much time so I will need to speed through as many of those as possible
2015-10-18 18:09:45	@Espyo	that sucks
2015-10-18 18:11:39	Yoshi2	it really does
2015-10-18 18:12:20	Yoshi2	found out that I need to turn something in much sooner than expected, soo yeah
2015-10-18 18:17:55	Yoshi2	my first reaction when I find out that I need to do something in a very shot time span: total shock
2015-10-18 18:18:12	Yoshi2	my second reaction: "eh, I'll probably manage somehow"
2015-10-18 18:18:23	@Espyo	yep, typical
2015-10-18 18:39:28	@J	third reaction: continue procrastinating

2015-10-18 19:31:57	@Espyo	let's get it done then
2015-10-18 19:38:53	En_Passant	Why are all of the sentences in the first paragraphs rhetorical questions?
2015-10-18 19:40:43	Yoshi2	En_Passant: espyo is trying to be a bit more direct because this person does not seem to understand why having two wikis which deal with the same topic is not good
2015-10-18 19:40:50	En_Passant	Wish I could've seen the rest of the conversation, but my wi-fi decided it didn't like me
2015-10-18 19:43:40	En_Passant	I just think it could be worded better
2015-10-18 19:47:45	@Espyo	probably

2015-10-20 22:14:05	@Espyo	hi
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	wanna play hangman?
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	because I found a font in Pikmin 3 with the alien symbols in the game
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	and now I'm trying to decode text I found scattered throughout the game
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	but it's hard because some characters are repeated
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@PikFan	I always thought that the characters are heavily distorted Japanese characters
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	you see a K, a Y, an E, an R...
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	loads more
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	slightly distorted
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	anyway this font has 27 characters
2015-10-20 22:16:26	@Espyo	so... dead giveaway
2015-10-20 22:16:32	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-20 22:16:39	@PikFan	what could be the 27th character?
2015-10-20 22:17:13	@Espyo	maybe space
2015-10-20 22:17:24	@Espyo	not only are there repeats
2015-10-20 22:17:42	@Espyo	but I don't know if the first character stands for A, or if for whatever extra character there is (space?), and the second is A
2015-10-20 22:17:47	@Espyo	so... loads of variables
2015-10-20 22:17:53	@PikFan	can I see?
2015-10-20 22:18:02	@Espyo	sure

2015-10-20 22:19:49	@Espyo	oh, it's working!
2015-10-20 22:19:54	@Espyo	I'm reading the text on the SPERO
2015-10-20 22:19:57	@Espyo	it has two llines
2015-10-20 22:19:59	@Espyo	*lines
2015-10-20 22:20:02	@Espyo	couldn't gather anything from the first
2015-10-20 22:20:08	@Espyo	but the second definitely says ULTRASOO__
2015-10-20 22:20:12	@Espyo	just have to find the other two characters
2015-10-20 22:20:32	@Espyo	or ULTRASOC__
2015-10-20 22:20:39	@Espyo	or ULTRASCO__
2015-10-20 22:21:16	@PikFan	why are there two K's
2015-10-20 22:21:57	@Espyo	ULTRASCOPE
2015-10-20 22:22:02	@Espyo	because they like to mess with our heads
2015-10-20 22:22:08	@Espyo	K is C and also O
2015-10-20 22:22:17	@PikFan	...what
2015-10-20 22:22:25	@Espyo	well, not "K", but that K-look-alike
2015-10-20 22:22:32	@PikFan	wait, these are in alphabetical order...?
2015-10-20 22:22:35	@Espyo	they have to be
2015-10-20 22:22:44	@Espyo	if they are, the text on the SPERO does say ULTRASCOPE
2015-10-20 22:22:59	@PikFan	ultrascope
2015-10-20 22:23:00	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-20 22:23:40	@PikFan	ugh, there's a lot of repeats
2015-10-20 22:24:14	@PikFan	I see two "A", two "6", and two backward E's
2015-10-20 22:24:36	@PikFan	and also two things that look like Q's

2015-10-20 22:32:22	@Espyo	the font file is upside down
2015-10-20 22:32:26	@Espyo	at least the converted PNG file is
2015-10-20 22:32:33	@Espyo	I only discovered this because the other fonts were upside down too
2015-10-20 22:32:38	@Espyo	otherwise this could've taken a LOT longer
2015-10-20 22:33:09	@PikFan	wait, so what I'm seeing is upside down

2015-10-20 23:02:54	@Espyo	for sure
2015-10-20 23:03:16	@PikFan	hopefully it's not just gibberish
2015-10-20 23:04:21	@Espyo	the KopPad has 4 letters
2015-10-20 23:04:25	@Espyo	"GPAD" is what it translates to

2015-10-20 23:06:15	@PikFan	I've seen it before
2015-10-20 23:07:47	@Espyo	looks like it is

2015-10-20 23:08:42	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-10-20 23:08:43	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-20 23:08:50	@Espyo	man, I can't WAIT to make an article on this
2015-10-20 23:08:50	@PikFan	where on the SPERO does it have characters?
2015-10-20 23:08:53	@Espyo	and you know the best part?
2015-10-20 23:08:58	@Espyo	I can upload these letters to the wik
2015-10-20 23:09:00	@Espyo	*i
2015-10-20 23:09:14	@Espyo	and we can use that to show text in that font
2015-10-20 23:09:49	@Espyo	something like {{font|g}} {{font|p}} {{font|a}} {{font|d}}
2015-10-20 23:09:49	@PikFan	hm

2015-10-20 23:10:04	@Espyo	and those letters could link to the article with the text
2015-10-20 23:10:10	@PikFan	okay, that's less complex than I was thinking
2015-10-20 23:10:15	@Espyo	and the article could have a table matching every symbol with every letter
2015-10-20 23:10:16	@Espyo	#HYPE
2015-10-20 23:10:16	@PikFan	but still seems really tedious
2015-10-20 23:10:29	@PikFan	well, gotta make sacrifices
2015-10-20 23:10:36	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard
2015-10-20 23:10:39	@Espyo	only the upload, really
2015-10-20 23:10:43	@PikFan	but yeah, this is exciting
2015-10-20 23:10:48	@Espyo	upload every file as something like "Pikmin 3 font _.png"
2015-10-20 23:10:53	@Espyo	where the _ is the name of the letter
2015-10-20 23:10:59	@PikFan	are you telling the Skype folk about this?
2015-10-20 23:11:03	@Espyo	and then on the template, just call [[File:Pikmin 3 font {{{1}}}.png"

2015-10-20 23:11:39	@Espyo	likely not
2015-10-20 23:11:55	@PikFan	well, for the translation, I mean
2015-10-20 23:12:21	@Espyo	eh, probably not
2015-10-20 23:12:25	@Espyo	transcript is good for large chunks of text
2015-10-20 23:12:29	@Espyo	if we're just explaining a single word
2015-10-20 23:12:34	@Espyo	we might as well use regular quotes

2015-10-21 19:33:17	@Espyo	it's fine
2015-10-21 19:33:25	@Espyo	we all have responsibilities and all
2015-10-21 19:37:31	ScruffyChat	I wanted to ask how your Wii U emulator is working for you
2015-10-21 19:37:43	@Espyo	oh, I didn't run it heh
2015-10-21 19:37:45	@Espyo	can't
2015-10-21 19:37:47	@Espyo	windows 10 only
2015-10-21 19:37:49	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-21 19:37:50	@Espyo	it'd be slow either way
2015-10-21 19:37:53	@Espyo	thing was
2015-10-21 19:37:53	ScruffyChat	Shoot
2015-10-21 19:38:01	@Espyo	the news about the emulator probably spanned a more recent wave of dumps
2015-10-21 19:38:03	@Espyo	and in that wave
2015-10-21 19:38:07	@Espyo	I found another dump of Pikmin 3
2015-10-21 19:38:10	@Espyo	and this one works well
2015-10-21 19:38:14	ScruffyChat	ooh
2015-10-21 19:38:16	@Espyo	and we already found a lot of gold in it
2015-10-21 19:38:20	ScruffyChat	Great
2015-10-21 19:38:33	ScruffyChat	Are we able to extract textures?
2015-10-21 19:40:31	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-21 19:40:34	@Espyo	we could before
2015-10-21 19:40:38	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-21 19:40:40	@Espyo	it's just that the previous dump was corrupted midway through
2015-10-21 19:40:46	@Espyo	so only the "first half" of stuff could be retrieved
2015-10-21 19:40:53	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-21 19:40:55	@Espyo	anyway, the latest finding is a font with the Koppaite characters
2015-10-21 19:41:09	@Espyo	with it, we can map the alien Koppaite text all around the game to English
2015-10-21 19:41:25	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-21 19:41:33	ScruffyChat	Oh man, I thought they made it up

2015-10-21 19:42:29	@Espyo	so did I
2015-10-21 19:42:32	@Espyo	until I found this yesterday
2015-10-21 19:42:40	@Espyo	I made this map https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/p3%20font%20map.png
2015-10-21 19:42:43	@Espyo	we already decoded some things
2015-10-21 19:42:52	@Espyo	the text on the SPERO says "Automatic Ultrascope"
2015-10-21 19:42:57	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-10-21 19:42:58	@Espyo	I'll be making an article on it
2015-10-21 19:43:12	@Espyo	plus some images and templates to give us the ability to write in that text
2015-10-21 19:43:25	ScruffyChat	Amazing
2015-10-21 19:43:31	ScruffyChat	I had never thought of that
2015-10-21 19:43:51	@Espyo	it's pretty insane
2015-10-21 19:46:47	ScruffyChat	I wonder, since the music isn't MIDI-driven, are there just the music files in a folder?
2015-10-21 19:48:41	@Espyo	yeah, Pikmin 3 music is an eight-channel stream
2015-10-21 19:48:59	@Espyo	we actually got access to the audio folder before even the first dump
2015-10-21 19:49:06	@Espyo	somebody dumped just that around a year ago
2015-10-21 19:49:06	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-21 19:49:26	ScruffyChat	Might I ask where???
2015-10-21 19:51:46	@Espyo	uh... I honestly can't remember
2015-10-21 19:54:47	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-21 19:56:37	ScruffyChat	Anything else? I know it showed accurate values for medals in Mission Moe
2015-10-21 19:56:39	ScruffyChat	Mode*
2015-10-21 20:00:41	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-21 20:00:46	@Espyo	well, we can get a lot of things
2015-10-21 20:01:00	@Espyo	there's actually not a lot of file types we CAN'T read
2015-10-21 20:01:04	@Espyo	it's better than Pikmin 2 in that regard
2015-10-21 20:01:15	ScruffyChat	oh good
2015-10-21 20:01:19	ScruffyChat	Agreed
2015-10-21 20:06:00	ScruffyChat	Are models becoming extractable as well?
2015-10-21 20:08:57	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-21 20:08:59	@Espyo	not animations though
2015-10-21 20:10:58	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-21 20:11:03	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-10-21 20:11:29	Yoshi2	I'm still sad about how weird the pikmin2 bms files are
2015-10-21 20:12:06	Yoshi2	and then pikmin 3 comes and... it doesn't have any of the pikmin 2 weirdness
2015-10-21 20:12:29	ScruffyChat	They learned
2015-10-21 20:12:33	ScruffyChat	it took them 8 years
2015-10-21 20:14:12	@Espyo	hehe
2015-10-21 20:14:17	@Espyo	still has some weirdnesses
2015-10-21 20:14:25	@Espyo	unused carrying values in some enemy config files
2015-10-21 20:14:27	En_Passant	Pikmin wasn't that borked
2015-10-21 20:14:35	@Espyo	while the real carrying values are all on their own file
2015-10-21 20:15:01	En_Passant	I think there were just planning issues on P2's part
2015-10-21 20:15:50	@Espyo	definitely
2015-10-21 20:16:04	@Espyo	either that or each developer worked in a different continent
2015-10-21 20:16:16	@Espyo	and the only way they had to communicate on how to organize the files is via carrier pigeon
2015-10-21 20:17:00	Yoshi2	yup
2015-10-21 20:18:00	Yoshi2	and the only carrier pidgeon they had died in an accident
2015-10-21 20:18:16	ScruffyChat	So onto smoke signal
2015-10-21 20:18:25	ScruffyChat	By the way, are there any test areas?
2015-10-21 20:20:20	Yoshi2	the last time I asked Espyo he said there were no unused maps
2015-10-21 20:20:45	@Espyo	hehe
2015-10-21 20:20:46	@Espyo	no test areas
2015-10-21 20:20:56	@Espyo	ok, the guys've spent the whole night decoding misc. Koppai stuff
2015-10-21 20:21:02	@Espyo	they found a LOT of crazy things, it seems
2015-10-21 20:21:24	@Espyo	I CAN'T WAIT to make an article out of his

2015-10-21 20:21:41	En_Passant	What are you waiting for?
2015-10-21 20:22:18	Yoshi2	maybe waiting to have more time
2015-10-21 20:23:09	ScruffyChat	Any sneak peaks?
2015-10-21 20:23:28	ScruffyChat	peek* I'm dumb

2015-10-21 20:28:02	ScruffyChat	Now that's detail
2015-10-21 20:28:23	@Espyo	so disorganized though
2015-10-21 20:28:34	@Espyo	and I have an inkling that some of those translations were a bit hastily mad
2015-10-21 20:28:35	@Espyo	*e
2015-10-21 20:33:26	ScruffyChat	This whole time it's just a code for english
2015-10-21 20:33:45	ScruffyChat	And there seem to be a lot more end-of-day notes than I thought there'd be
2015-10-21 20:34:02	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-21 20:34:07	@Espyo	I had added a lot more to the article
2015-10-21 20:34:13	@Espyo	but Firefox on Linux isn't that stable

2015-10-21 20:55:27	@Espyo	do we know if that's Koppaite, though?
2015-10-21 20:55:32	CreativeSushi2	KoppaiteCharX.png
2015-10-21 20:55:39	@Espyo	could be some intergalatic font
2015-10-21 20:55:44	ScruffyChat	So the people are "Koppaite," and the language is "Koppite?"
2015-10-21 20:55:50	@Espyo	I think that was a typo :V
2015-10-21 20:55:53	Chiaki_Nanami	yes
2015-10-21 20:55:55	En_Passant	I was thinking Koppaian

2015-10-21 20:56:27	Yoshi2	"People of Koppai", "Language of Koppai"
2015-10-21 20:56:29	Chiaki_Nanami	we really do
2015-10-21 20:56:30	Yoshi2	problem solved
2015-10-21 20:56:56	Chiaki_Nanami	are we sure it's the language of the Koppai?
2015-10-21 20:57:02	@Espyo	that's the problem
2015-10-21 20:57:13	@Espyo	could be an intergalactic language...
2015-10-21 20:57:23	Chiaki_Nanami	okay so
2015-10-21 20:57:30	Chiaki_Nanami	let's get this straight
2015-10-21 20:57:37	Nvortex	pikmin_3_text.jpg
2015-10-21 20:57:41	Chiaki_Nanami	canocially there are two planets, Hocotate and Koppai
2015-10-21 20:58:03	@Espyo	but Pikmin 3 text is a bit vague
2015-10-21 20:58:06	@Espyo	could probably work
2015-10-21 20:58:07	Chiaki_Nanami	have we seen anything that suggests their usage in Pikmin 1 and/or Pikmin 2?
2015-10-21 20:58:12	@Espyo	it's the less speculative, too
2015-10-21 20:58:14	ScruffyChat	They understand each other's languages, but you can tell by the spoken languages they aren't the same
2015-10-21 20:58:16	@Espyo	noot really
2015-10-21 20:58:26	@Espyo	*not
2015-10-21 20:58:33	@Espyo	guess I'll go with "Pikmin 3 text"
2015-10-21 20:58:36	Chiaki_Nanami	then by all means it should be classified as the Language of the Koppai
2015-10-21 20:58:40	@Espyo	but it doesn't really portray the idea of it being this alien text
2015-10-21 20:58:45	@Espyo	sounds more like it's a text dump from the game
2015-10-21 20:58:59	ScruffyChat	Then it comes to
2015-10-21 20:58:59	@Espyo	I think we should go with Koppaite...
2015-10-21 20:59:05	@Espyo	doesn't look like P1, P2 or Hocotatians in general use it
2015-10-21 20:59:13	ScruffyChat	Putting Hocotatians and Koppaites under one category
2015-10-21 20:59:15	Chiaki_Nanami	that seems like the most logical step
2015-10-21 20:59:23	@Espyo	also, "Koppaite" would work as the word
2015-10-21 20:59:28	@Espyo	you say "American people" and "American language"
2015-10-21 20:59:35	@Espyo	"Portuguese people", "Portuguese language"
2015-10-21 20:59:43	@Espyo	"Italian users", "Italian language"
2015-10-21 20:59:44	@Espyo	etc.
2015-10-21 20:59:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-21 20:59:52	@Espyo	so "Koppaite explorers", "Koppaite language"
2015-10-21 21:00:06	@Espyo	got dinner now
2015-10-21 21:00:11	@Espyo	I'll think throught it a tad more during

2015-10-21 21:35:23	ScruffyChat	Thank you very much.
2015-10-21 21:35:47	ScruffyChat	I really should make a tutorial series or something
2015-10-21 21:35:57	ScruffyChat	On how to make materials and light look realistic

2015-10-21 21:37:20	ScruffyChat	Anyway, I think I might have told you that the final boss in PF would no longer be an animal but a fungus
2015-10-21 21:37:37	ScruffyChat	The only problem with that is that Mushroom Pikmin also exist in the game and are harmless

2015-10-21 21:38:23	ScruffyChat	Although, all Pikmin are animals that are harmless to you when many harmful animals and plants exist, so I suppose it could work

2015-10-21 21:46:04	ScruffyChat	Oh, I meant it would be connected by roots to the earth and to other animals
2015-10-21 21:46:18	ScruffyChat	Sort of "hacking" them, corrupting them
2015-10-21 21:46:30	ScruffyChat	It's what parasitic fungus does

2015-10-21 22:53:50	@Espyo	hi
2015-10-21 22:53:51	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-21 22:54:06	@PikFan	how's the decoding going?
2015-10-21 22:54:09	@Espyo	everybody's hyped for the forums and the decoding
2015-10-21 22:54:15	@Espyo	article ready to submit
2015-10-21 22:54:19	@PikFan	wait... forums?
2015-10-21 22:54:22	@Espyo	just gonna add more and more translations until I get tired
2015-10-21 22:54:25	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-21 22:54:32	@PikFan	like... off-wiki forums?

2015-10-21 22:54:51	@PikFan	wow
2015-10-21 22:55:05	@PikFan	oh, in that case, it might be a good idea to have Fanon's forums there, too
2015-10-21 22:55:19	@Espyo	I think these are just meant to be Pikmin forums
2015-10-21 22:55:20	@Espyo	in general
2015-10-21 22:55:25	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-21 22:57:41	@PikFan	should we add it to the news?

2015-10-21 22:58:40	Nvortex	well thanks to testyo i found a griefer
2015-10-21 22:58:41	Testyo	it did /what
2015-10-21 22:58:42	@Espyo	let's not add a nearly empty article to the news

2015-10-21 22:58:59	@PikFan	oh, nearly empty
2015-10-21 22:59:06	@PikFan	I thought it was nearly complete
2015-10-21 22:59:31	@PikFan	what other things have you decoded?
2015-10-21 22:59:36	@Espyo	yeah, but I'm including a list of translations
2015-10-21 22:59:39	@Espyo	and I've only really got 3

2015-10-21 23:05:56	ScruffyChat	I hadn't been on in a while, I was really surprised to hear we had translated the language
2015-10-21 23:05:57	@PikFan	I hear that you've been busy?
2015-10-21 23:06:07	Nvortex	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Nvortex#New_Mechanics
2015-10-21 23:06:10	Nvortex	theres my wip idea
2015-10-21 23:06:12	@PikFan	yeah, Espyo's making progress
2015-10-21 23:06:12	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the past week's been bad
2015-10-21 23:06:14	Nvortex	kinda crappy
2015-10-21 23:06:50	ScruffyChat	It's not crappy, that's a good idea
2015-10-21 23:06:58	ScruffyChat	Radioactive items
2015-10-21 23:07:10	Nvortex	no radiactivity
2015-10-21 23:07:17	Nvortex	pnf-404 is radioactive on itself
2015-10-21 23:07:17	ScruffyChat	oh
2015-10-21 23:07:24	ScruffyChat	Oh, right
2015-10-21 23:07:28	Nvortex	remember the geiger counter in pikmin 1
2015-10-21 23:07:43	@PikFan	I lol'd at the picture
2015-10-21 23:08:19	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah that reminds me
2015-10-21 23:08:30	@PikFan	hm, if you want, you could put your ideas on Fanon
2015-10-21 23:08:39	En_Passant	I already suggested that
2015-10-21 23:08:40	@PikFan	but you don't have to
2015-10-21 23:08:46	@PikFan	ohi En_Passant
2015-10-21 23:09:20	Nvortex	i dont want to put them on fanon because they are just some random ideas i have, i dont have an idea for a fan game
2015-10-21 23:09:43	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-10-21 23:10:25	ScruffyChat	That wouldn't be a problem though, would it?
2015-10-21 23:10:36	ScruffyChat	Pikmin Fanon is for Pikmin ideas, not only fangames
2015-10-21 23:10:46	@PikFan	no, of course not
2015-10-21 23:11:15	@PikFan	@former statement
2015-10-21 23:11:17	Nvortex	it would be a bit weird for people to find a page with some random ideas and not a fan game
2015-10-21 23:11:27	@PikFan	userspace, then
2015-10-21 23:11:55	Nvortex	no one will ever see them that way...well its not like poeple will ever see my ideas here but still
2015-10-21 23:12:02	Nvortex	i see no need for 2 accounts
2015-10-21 23:12:28	@PikFan	we all have two accounts, though
2015-10-21 23:12:41	@PikFan	but I get you
2015-10-21 23:12:42	Nvortex	we being the keyword
2015-10-21 23:13:25	Nvortex	also no one ever edits pages from other users so that place i kinda lonely in that way
2015-10-21 23:13:32	Nvortex	everyone does their stuff for themselves
2015-10-21 23:13:47	Nvortex	atleast here i edit stuff that some other people can edit if i was wrong
2015-10-21 23:13:54	Nvortex	and make the page better
2015-10-21 23:14:18	@PikFan	yeah, users tend to be independent when it comes to editing
2015-10-21 23:14:43	@PikFan	I think they're afraid they'll change other users' ideas, so that's why they don't do that
2015-10-21 23:14:44	ScruffyChat	I'd imagine that was what the Guild of Bulborbs was for, but there just aren't enough people to keep it circulating
2015-10-21 23:14:51	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-10-21 23:15:00	@PikFan	lack of interest and users, really
2015-10-21 23:15:11	Nvortex	what is the guild of bulborbs
2015-10-21 23:15:26	@PikFan	it was this thing created by an admin at Fanon
2015-10-21 23:15:40	@PikFan	basically, you sign up to be a Bulborb
2015-10-21 23:15:47	Nvortex	insta no for me
2015-10-21 23:15:47	@PikFan	either Red, Hairy, Orange
2015-10-21 23:15:56	@PikFan	and each has a different job
2015-10-21 23:15:56	Nvortex	for another reason
2015-10-21 23:16:13	@PikFan	[[f:PikminFanon:Guild of Bulborbs]]

2015-10-21 23:16:29	Nvortex	sign up to be a bulborb...just reading this would send down a chill down the spine of the skype people
2015-10-21 23:16:54	@PikFan	I honestly don't see what's wrong with it
2015-10-21 23:17:09	Nvortex	kirbybulborb
2015-10-21 23:17:11	@PikFan	it's just a title, really
2015-10-21 23:17:16	Nvortex	aka kirby 252164135465156
2015-10-21 23:17:22	Nvortex	aka mr 1000 accounts
2015-10-21 23:17:27	Nvortex	aka the cancer of the community
2015-10-21 23:17:30	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-21 23:17:40	Nvortex	youtube user
2015-10-21 23:17:45	Nvortex	its a*
2015-10-21 23:17:53	@PikFan	never heard of him till now
2015-10-21 23:17:54	Nvortex	or should i say users
2015-10-21 23:18:16	Nvortex	he has an infinite(obvious exageration) amount of alt accounts
2015-10-21 23:18:18	En_Passant	I think the reason nobody edits other people's stuff is because they don't want that person to get agnry
2015-10-21 23:18:21	Nvortex	all subbed to himself
2015-10-21 23:18:34	En_Passant	*angry
2015-10-21 23:18:39	Nvortex	we are unable to know how many he has made for himself
2015-10-21 23:18:41	En_Passant	We are talking about a crowd of mostly prepubescent kids here
2015-10-21 23:18:55	Nvortex	you talking about kirby? because then yes
2015-10-21 23:18:55	@PikFan	En_Passant: right, that ties in with my point about being afraid of accidentally changing others' ideas
2015-10-21 23:19:29	Nvortex	it also ties with me thinking that they dont edit because they dont want people to feel like they are interfering with their ideas
2015-10-21 23:20:11	ScruffyChat	Copyright is so complicated
2015-10-21 23:20:29	@PikFan	it's not really so much a copyright issue as it is a maturity issue
2015-10-21 23:20:51	@PikFan	but yes, it is
2015-10-21 23:22:09	En_Passant	Kinda sorta
2015-10-21 23:22:32	En_Passant	Even if the ideas aren't changed, someone may get mad that somebody else is touching their stuff
2015-10-21 23:22:44	Nvortex	combine little kid + stolen work + pikmin plushie videos + alt accounts to sub to himself + bad videos + equally stupid little kid friends + praising the dark lord steve and you get kirbybulborb
2015-10-21 23:22:59	@PikFan	lovely
2015-10-21 23:23:06	@PikFan	and Steve, ugh
2015-10-21 23:23:33	@PikFan	I will forgive Chuggaa, but I'll never forgive the fandom
2015-10-21 23:23:52	@PikFan	I've always hated Steve
2015-10-21 23:23:53	@PikFan	always
2015-10-21 23:24:03	Nvortex	oh
2015-10-21 23:24:08	Nvortex	and praise to the dark lord chuggaa
2015-10-21 23:24:12	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing Chuggaa invented Seve?
2015-10-21 23:24:16	@PikFan	yes
2015-10-21 23:24:17	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-21 23:24:17	ScruffyChat	steve*
2015-10-21 23:24:18	Nvortex	now i dont have anything against chuggaa
2015-10-21 23:24:26	Nvortex	but his fandom
2015-10-21 23:24:28	@Espyo	remember: he doesn't like the Steve memedom either
2015-10-21 23:24:29	Nvortex	UUHUHUHUGHUHG
2015-10-21 23:24:57	@PikFan	like I said, I forgive Chuggaa, but not the fandom/memedom/whateverdom
2015-10-21 23:25:35	@PikFan	Steve really ruined my image of Pikmin fans
2015-10-21 23:25:50	@PikFan	like, you guys are what I expect of Pikmin fans

2015-10-21 23:32:21	Jpmrocks	scruffy, would you mind if we mention your renders in a PikCast?
2015-10-21 23:32:22	ScruffyChat	The thing is, I don't want to keep people in suspense, even though it'll take a long time
2015-10-21 23:32:37	ScruffyChat	Oh, I wouldn't mind at all
2015-10-21 23:32:42	@PikFan	I'm for it
2015-10-21 23:32:43	ScruffyChat	Just credit me, I suppose
2015-10-21 23:32:54	@PikFan	it would help get people interested
2015-10-21 23:32:58	ScruffyChat	I'll model anything you request
2015-10-21 23:33:17	ScruffyChat	Pikmin-related, of course :)
2015-10-21 23:33:20	@PikFan	oh, also, whatever happened to the community spotlight videos? I was enjoying those
2015-10-21 23:34:10	ScruffyChat	You know what, I'm gonna get back on the rendering project right now
2015-10-21 23:34:24	ScruffyChat	It's high time I completed it once and for all
2015-10-21 23:34:37	Nvortex	is the secret render the mongret? (will it still be named like that anyways)
2015-10-21 23:34:53	ScruffyChat	It is not (and I'm not sure)
2015-10-21 23:35:10	ScruffyChat	It is a video
2015-10-21 23:35:17	Nvortex	oh
2015-10-21 23:35:25	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna animate the opening to Pikmin Forever
2015-10-21 23:35:30	ScruffyChat	in Blender
2015-10-21 23:35:51	ScruffyChat	with visuals, music, sound, and voiceovers by me
2015-10-21 23:36:02	Nvortex	[the hype is real]
2015-10-21 23:36:03	ScruffyChat	It's coming along pretty well, but I have a long way to go
2015-10-21 23:36:12	Nvortex	will it be the old idea for forever?
2015-10-21 23:36:19	Nvortex	the longs legs and the moons?
2015-10-21 23:36:30	En_Passant	That probably won't be in the opening
2015-10-21 23:36:33	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-21 23:36:33	En_Passant	Talk about spoilers
2015-10-21 23:36:41	ScruffyChat	Haha
2015-10-21 23:36:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the opening has to keep things... open
2015-10-21 23:36:55	ScruffyChat	ambiguous
2015-10-21 23:37:39	ScruffyChat	And I've always had a passion for voice acting, luckily I can get my voice to sound around the way I want for this narration
2015-10-21 23:38:07	ScruffyChat	But I'm an amateur filmmaker, so the process is pretty slow
2015-10-21 23:38:15	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry it's going to take a while
2015-10-21 23:38:28	Nvortex	its ok
2015-10-21 23:39:12	ScruffyChat	But the rendered scenes are more than halfway there
2015-10-21 23:40:13	Jpmrocks	scruffy, im really jealous
2015-10-21 23:40:20	Jpmrocks	like, im making Maya and Max classes
2015-10-21 23:40:25	Jpmrocks	and my stuff looks like arse
2015-10-21 23:41:15	Nvortex	git gud
2015-10-21 23:41:16	ScruffyChat	I can help point you in the right direction
2015-10-21 23:41:25	ScruffyChat	What are you trying to model?
2015-10-21 23:42:25	Nvortex	[sudden unexpected silence]
2015-10-21 23:43:22	@PikFan	beep
2015-10-21 23:46:52	Jpmrocks	sorry
2015-10-21 23:46:57	Jpmrocks	no, im taking college courses
2015-10-21 23:47:13	Jpmrocks	we have to do the modeling, and mapping of objects
2015-10-21 23:47:25	Jpmrocks	so we have poly limits, texture size limits, etc
2015-10-21 23:47:31	ScruffyChat	Oh

2015-10-21 23:49:00	@PikFan	this needs to happen
2015-10-21 23:49:11	@PikFan	Professor Scruffy
2015-10-21 23:49:13	ScruffyChat	Well, the thing is
2015-10-21 23:49:28	ScruffyChat	I know how to use Blender, but not when it comes to being efficient
2015-10-21 23:49:58	Jpmrocks	ah thats true
2015-10-21 23:50:02	Jpmrocks	like, you can do stills
2015-10-21 23:50:03	ScruffyChat	I know how to make things look pretty, but I probably take the least efficient road to it
2015-10-21 23:50:10	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-21 23:50:20	Jpmrocks	usually we wanna keep our poly count to 1k
2015-10-21 23:50:20	Testyo	1 K = -272.15 °C / -457.87 °F
2015-10-21 23:50:25	ScruffyChat	But I've been learning so much about animation, as I've been animating
2015-10-21 23:50:29	Jpmrocks	thanks, testyo...
2015-10-21 23:50:30	Testyo	it's mostly for complex
2015-10-21 23:50:50	Jpmrocks	3danimation can use more polys
2015-10-21 23:50:53	Jpmrocks	Maya's really good
2015-10-21 23:50:57	Jpmrocks	ive been learning rigging
2015-10-21 23:51:30	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-21 23:51:36	ScruffyChat	I need to get into Maya
2015-10-21 23:51:43	ScruffyChat	I have Blender because I'm poooooor

2015-10-22 00:00:21	@PikFan	*in-depth
2015-10-22 00:00:41	Nvortex	cat might be the factory seal
2015-10-22 00:00:45	Nvortex	(talking about drake)
2015-10-22 00:01:04	Nvortex	like the name of the factory that made the drake or the part is CAT
2015-10-22 00:01:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah, below the symbol of the cat
2015-10-22 00:01:11	Nvortex	or maybe the OS is named CAT
2015-10-22 00:01:20	ScruffyChat	the cat is the logo
2015-10-22 00:01:39	@Espyo	yeah, could be apple juice
2015-10-22 00:01:42	@Espyo	but a) just apple? kinda weird
2015-10-22 00:01:50	Nvortex	alhp's grandfather made the drake, but CAT might be the manufacturer
2015-10-22 00:01:53	@Espyo	b) I've always seen OJ seen as short for orange juice, not aj for apple
2015-10-22 00:02:07	ScruffyChat	Same
2015-10-22 00:02:08	Nvortex	orange juice/apple juice
2015-10-22 00:02:15	Nvortex	a can mean o

2015-10-22 00:02:20	@Espyo	but with two letters, it's really... eesh
2015-10-22 00:02:22	@Espyo	ambiguous
2015-10-22 00:02:44	Nvortex	what if once nintendo realizes we have the language decoded they reveal info about 4?
2015-10-22 00:03:11	@Espyo	what if this is all an ARG?
2015-10-22 00:03:15	ScruffyChat	They'll email us in Koppaite

2015-10-22 00:08:14	ScruffyChat	But just modeling, it's something I need serious work on
2015-10-22 00:10:40	Nvortex	have you ever wondered how louie got to twilight river if the ship was in the garden of hope?
2015-10-22 00:11:16	ScruffyChat	I've been wanting to write a story about louie
2015-10-22 00:11:30	ScruffyChat	How he did everything
2015-10-22 00:13:48	Nvortex	today we came to the conclusion that *something* made the ship fail just like the drake did, ejecting louie and sending him into the TW while the ship emergency landed in the GOH
2015-10-22 00:14:17	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-10-22 00:14:54	ScruffyChat	Another odd thing, in his secret videos Olimar always refers to himself as the pilot of the SS Dolphin, even though he doesn't pilot it at the teime
2015-10-22 00:14:57	ScruffyChat	time*
2015-10-22 00:15:25	Nvortex	yeah that might be some translation error
2015-10-22 00:15:39	Nvortex	because olimar does mention wanting to rebuy the SS dolphin 
2015-10-22 00:15:47	Nvortex	and calls the ship just the ship
2015-10-22 00:16:04	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-22 00:20:09	Jpmrocks	i swear somewhere i read that his Dolphin is the prototype for the dolphins that the Freight uses
2015-10-22 00:20:17	Jpmrocks	cause olimar is an engineer
2015-10-22 00:20:36	Nvortex	it was probably some random comment
2015-10-22 00:20:43	Nvortex	oh i think dave mentioned it some day
2015-10-22 00:20:55	Nvortex	the ship called the dolphin that it

2015-10-22 22:24:18	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-22 22:25:32	@PikFan	say, why's your Peckish Aristocrab clay?
2015-10-22 22:25:43	@Espyo	...*claw?
2015-10-22 22:25:51	@PikFan	clay

2015-10-22 22:25:57	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/1/1c/Aristoclay.png
2015-10-22 22:26:39	@PikFan	er, a better question is why is it made of clay
2015-10-22 22:27:39	ScruffyChat	It's a story
2015-10-22 22:27:45	ScruffyChat	I started out trying to model a Snagret
2015-10-22 22:27:57	ScruffyChat	But the texture I found had no color around the eyes
2015-10-22 22:28:28	ScruffyChat	I would have painted it in myself, but I started to like the look of it without textures, as just the shape
2015-10-22 22:29:15	ScruffyChat	So I tried making it look like a clay model
2015-10-22 22:29:21	ScruffyChat	And it looked pretty cool
2015-10-22 22:29:27	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-22 22:29:31	ScruffyChat	So I switched to something more complex
2015-10-22 22:29:57	ScruffyChat	I could easily replace the clay with color
2015-10-22 22:30:16	ScruffyChat	But it was nice just admiring the shape of the Aristocrab
2015-10-22 22:30:29	@PikFan	it does look interesting
2015-10-22 22:30:46	@PikFan	but... why is it holding a bomb rock? it seems random
2015-10-22 22:30:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-22 22:31:04	ScruffyChat	It's that moment before it eats a bomb rock
2015-10-22 22:31:08	@PikFan	don't get me wrong, I love the picture
2015-10-22 22:31:15	ScruffyChat	I probably should have included Pikmin in the pictur
2015-10-22 22:31:33	ScruffyChat	I really wanted it to be holding a Rock Pikmin
2015-10-22 22:31:44	ScruffyChat	But I'd have to model a Rock Pikmin entirely from scratch
2015-10-22 22:32:28	ScruffyChat	It was just something I wanted to do quickly
2015-10-22 22:32:29	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-22 22:32:42	@PikFan	well, I appreciate how weird it is
2015-10-22 22:32:43	ScruffyChat	It took about 45 minutes to render at the end
2015-10-22 22:32:46	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-22 22:32:46	@PikFan	wow
2015-10-22 22:33:09	ScruffyChat	That's nothing
2015-10-22 22:33:30	ScruffyChat	The PF video has probably had around 2.5 days of rendering so far
2015-10-22 22:33:33	@PikFan	no, I said "wow" because of how short time it took to render
2015-10-22 22:33:44	ScruffyChat	OH
2015-10-22 22:33:48	ScruffyChat	Yeah, true

2015-10-22 22:40:30	@Espyo	anyway, I'm getting REALLY good at translating these
2015-10-22 22:40:34	@Espyo	I barely need the cipher
2015-10-22 22:40:34	@PikFan	yay
2015-10-22 22:40:37	@Espyo	it's like learning a new language
2015-10-22 22:40:51	@PikFan	how many have you translated so far?
2015-10-22 22:40:55	ScruffyChat	Pretty soon we'll be matching characters to the oral language
2015-10-22 22:41:04	ScruffyChat	"Spaa tempura"
2015-10-22 22:41:11	@PikFan	tempura
2015-10-22 22:41:14	@Espyo	the guys say it's just gibberish
2015-10-22 22:41:22	@PikFan	they could not know what tempura is
2015-10-22 22:41:26	ScruffyChat	Oh I know, I was kidding
2015-10-22 22:41:42	@PikFan	Espyo: there's not voice files or anything?
2015-10-22 22:41:45	ScruffyChat	I always heard Alph and Charlie saying "tempura"
2015-10-22 22:42:04	@PikFan	I'm wondering if it's like Midna from Twilight Princess, where she actually says scrambled English
2015-10-22 22:42:09	@Espyo	we can't open sound effects yet
2015-10-22 22:42:15	ScruffyChat	Speaking of sound effects
2015-10-22 22:42:16	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-22 22:42:41	ScruffyChat	The average Pikmin's voice is just a male voice (around C3 range) up two octaves
2015-10-22 22:42:57	ScruffyChat	Winged Pikmin are female around C4 raised an octave
2015-10-22 22:43:02	ScruffyChat	Rock Pikmin are a mystery
2015-10-22 22:43:39	ScruffyChat	And I'm guessing somebody special voiced the Pikmin when they sprout and say "Hi!" or "Whoopee!"
2015-10-22 22:43:44	ScruffyChat	Those are in falsetto
2015-10-22 22:43:46	@PikFan	I was disappointed that Purple Pikmin only had that deep voice in their intro cutscene
2015-10-22 22:43:48	@PikFan	same for Whites
2015-10-22 22:43:57	@Espyo	heh, neat
2015-10-22 22:45:16	ScruffyChat	I only found out from Smash Bros 4 files, so Rock Pikmin were not included

2015-10-23 19:05:15	Yoshi2	Espyo: so this semester we will be writing an operating system for a micro controller in C
2015-10-23 19:05:20	Yoshi2	it will be lots of fun
2015-10-23 19:05:36	@Espyo	oh wow
2015-10-23 19:11:56	@J	you can write an OS in C now?
2015-10-23 19:12:00	@J	you don't need any assembly?
2015-10-23 19:12:21	@J	sounds like a great thing to learn either way
2015-10-23 19:14:08	@Espyo	I wonder how many seconds it will take you to fix the fact that your shutdown dialog box randomly changes the default from "Shutdown" to "Reboot"
2015-10-23 19:14:19	@Espyo	probably negative 5 hours, since that won't happen in the first place
2015-10-23 19:14:29	@Espyo	you know me, I shouldn't have to explain that this is a jab at windows
2015-10-23 19:20:08	Yoshi2	we probably don't need much assembly as we will be working with a specific micro controller for which there is a dev environment
2015-10-23 19:24:29	@J	ah, okay
2015-10-23 19:24:59	@J	I don't know much about low-level stuff to begin with, just that kernels generally have at least some assembly

2015-10-23 22:10:56	Nvortex	 Also, The termite mound may be a pikmin nest, but not an onion...   After all, if pikmin are evolutioned onions, where did the first pikmin come from?   Perhaps the Plasm Wraith is keeping Olimar there because he's the savior of the pikmin.  After all, if this is the same creature, it may have considered Olimar a threat at first,  But after seeing how much t
2015-10-23 22:10:57	Nvortex	he pikmin love him, and that he made them flourish, changed it's   mind?  After all, the creatures in the Oak are merely illusions, all but the Dandelfly...  Something that HELPS pikmin...
2015-10-23 22:11:09	Nvortex	Also, the pikmin are unable to know where to go in the Oak...  Perhaps it's because it was once thier nest, a haven?  They would not need to bring it anywhere, for the onions and pikmin would be inside.     Also, the Spiderwort mold is found underneath Olimar's leaf...  the texture is a rip from Pikmin 2.  y u do dis?  It's so low res, why is that even there?

2015-10-23 22:41:19	@PikFan	I just feel like that they're going to ruin this game with this "unique twist"
2015-10-23 22:41:30	@PikFan	who knows? there's been hardly anything
2015-10-23 22:41:32	Nvortex	oh "unique"
2015-10-23 22:41:40	Nvortex	then i cant think of anything
2015-10-23 22:41:57	@PikFan	and that's another thing
2015-10-23 22:42:04	ScruffyM	Heh I actually thought of a game once that explains why the world loops, and why you can restart the story once you win
2015-10-23 22:42:07	@PikFan	why have they been holding back with the news
2015-10-23 22:42:27	@PikFan	they even said back at E3 that they had great footage but chose not to show it
2015-10-23 22:42:37	@PikFan	what kind of backwards logic is that?!
2015-10-23 22:43:13	Nvortex	either downgrade or upgrade
2015-10-23 22:43:21	@PikFan	they're not even promoting their main games
2015-10-23 22:43:23	Nvortex	im more inclined to think its a downgrade
2015-10-23 22:43:36	@PikFan	instead nowadays it seems that they're promoting SPIN OFFS
2015-10-23 22:44:02	@PikFan	we don't want all these spin offs
2015-10-23 22:44:13	@PikFan	the occasional spin off is good, but I don't want a ton of them
2015-10-23 22:44:20	ScruffyM	yeah we want nintendo to make mario, not tell us to do it
2015-10-23 22:44:31	@PikFan	like, why are they making two Animal Crossing spinoffs, not a main game
2015-10-23 22:45:11	ScruffyM	Is the Chibi-Robo/Pikmin spinoff still a thing?
2015-10-23 22:45:19	En_Passant	I think they're putting most of their effort into the NX
2015-10-23 22:45:27	En_Passant	I hope they are, at least
2015-10-23 22:45:47	@PikFan	I don't understand why they couldn't do that with the Wii U
2015-10-23 22:45:51	@PikFan	it's their own fault, too
2015-10-23 22:46:01	@PikFan	they barely pushed the marketing for it
2015-10-23 22:46:35	@PikFan	when the TV ads started, I never saw one on my TV
2015-10-23 22:46:36	@PikFan	not one
2015-10-23 22:46:51	ScruffyM	Ture, neither did I
2015-10-23 22:46:57	ScruffyM	True*
2015-10-23 22:47:12	@PikFan	yes, let's have the NX be a Turing machine
2015-10-23 22:48:16	@PikFan	anyway, I thought it was disappointing that Nintendo didn't put much effort into the Wii U
2015-10-23 22:48:32	@PikFan	hopefully Nintendo's new president can get some things right this time
2015-10-23 22:49:20	ScruffyM	Ok have to go for real this time, be back in a longer while
2015-10-23 22:49:28	@PikFan	okay, bye
2015-10-23 22:49:38	En_Passant	I
2015-10-23 22:49:46	En_Passant	'll likely be gone when you get back

2015-10-23 22:49:53	@PikFan	same
2015-10-23 22:50:10	@PikFan	but ugh
2015-10-23 22:50:16	@PikFan	I just hope that the NX is good
2015-10-23 22:50:25	@PikFan	I want a return to traditional controllers
2015-10-23 22:50:59	@PikFan	and I hope that the rumors that it'll be powerful are true
2015-10-23 22:51:14	@PikFan	but even then, it won't scrape up with the PS5 and the next Xbox
2015-10-23 22:51:39	@PikFan	they will undoubtedly be even more powerful
2015-10-23 22:52:05	@PikFan	also, they need to fix their online stuff
2015-10-23 22:52:25	@PikFan	Miiverse is quite... restrictive, I should say
2015-10-23 22:52:40	@PikFan	that's good and bad
2015-10-23 22:52:48	@PikFan	it's good because it stays on topic
2015-10-23 22:52:59	@PikFan	but bad because there's other things people want to talk about
2015-10-23 22:53:28	@PikFan	they need a more general online network structure
2015-10-23 22:54:03	@PikFan	...at this point I'm probably sounding like the stereotypical hater
2015-10-23 22:54:41	@PikFan	but I dunno, I feel like Nintendo could be a lot better

2015-10-24 18:30:54	ScruffyChat	So the only other question I have (and I'm working on this as well) is why are the Onions in P1 dormant, only to awaken when Olimar is near?

2015-10-24 18:33:01	Nvortex	i guess after many pikmin extinctions those onions decided to remain dormant relying on the nutrients that they could gather on the ground or maybe it was a recently born and it just needed a push to activate

2015-10-24 18:36:50	ScruffyChat	It sounds like a good theory, it ties all the loose ends together'
2015-10-24 18:40:47	ScruffyChat	And it eliminates the need for a leader, leaders just help a lot
2015-10-24 18:41:21	ScruffyChat	But they also use Pikmin instincts to their advantage in that case
2015-10-24 18:41:51	Nvortex	yes
2015-10-24 18:42:20	Nvortex	you can also say that they dont give pikmin any kind of free will
2015-10-24 18:42:47	Nvortex	they help the onion with nutrient gathering but for the sole purpose of letting them carry more heavy stuff
2015-10-24 18:43:03	Nvortex	and the onions are ok with that because they are still potecting them
2015-10-24 18:43:46	Nvortex	and helping with the reproduction cyckle
2015-10-24 18:44:34	ScruffyChat	Well, that's sort of a problem
2015-10-24 18:44:53	ScruffyChat	If Pikmin really did have the ability to help the Onions on their own, they wouldn't follow leaders
2015-10-24 18:45:19	ScruffyChat	Or at least, they certainly wouldn't follow leaders into caves where they can't return things to the Onion
2015-10-24 18:46:07	Nvortex	i suppose they arent really following leaders because they want to, its more like they are being controlled by the whistle just like how antenna beetles control pikmin
2015-10-24 18:46:26	Nvortex	also candypop buds grow in caves too so its not like they arent gaining anything
2015-10-24 18:46:26	ScruffyChat	I suppose
2015-10-24 18:46:32	ScruffyChat	True

2015-10-24 18:47:11	Nvortex	plasm wraith confirmed
2015-10-24 18:49:15	ScruffyChat	Wow
2015-10-24 18:49:35	ScruffyChat	So, could the plasm wraith be a big amalgam of microbes?
2015-10-24 18:49:44	Nvortex	there are 2 gold "producing" bacteria but i forgot the other one
2015-10-24 18:49:46	Nvortex	ys
2015-10-24 18:50:34	Nvortex	in the spanish version of the game, in expedition log 1 regarding the plasm wraith, it says that to hurt him you need to attack the ptotoplasm that separates from its body
2015-10-24 18:51:02	Nvortex	we at the pikmin wiki think that both wraiths are something like the portuguese man o war
2015-10-24 18:51:13	Nvortex	im also writing my theories regarding the plasm wraith
2015-10-24 18:51:28	Nvortex	both as a possible biological being or a mechanical
2015-10-24 18:52:08	Nvortex	i prefer to think that its mechanical but C. metallidurans and the other one are both "gold producing" bacteria
2015-10-24 18:52:19	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-24 18:52:31	Nvortex	also i think it was renamed to ralstonia metallidurans, cupriavidus seems to be the old one
2015-10-24 18:52:41	Nvortex	the old name that is
2015-10-24 18:53:12	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-24 18:54:05	ScruffyChat	Whether it's mechanical or not, there must have been some deposit of pure gold from which it was built
2015-10-24 18:54:27	Nvortex	Delftia acidovorans
2015-10-24 18:54:30	Nvortex	thats the othe one
2015-10-24 18:56:47	Nvortex	i like to think that the termite mounts were made by the wraith which was searching for gold or something

2015-10-24 18:58:14	ScruffyChat	Well, I don't think (if it were microbial) it would seek out gold, it just has a resistance to high pressure in metallic environments
2015-10-24 18:58:35	ScruffyChat	But it might explain all the gold nuggets lying around Mission Mode
2015-10-24 18:58:58	Nvortex	oh thats right
2015-10-24 18:59:42	Nvortex	and maybe its not like it was searching for gold, it just was a place filled with gold chloride
2015-10-24 18:59:57	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-24 19:00:04	ScruffyChat	So, not a termite mound at all
2015-10-24 19:00:32	Nvortex	or maybe some termite creatures trived there and the wraith came in and ate them all because the place was filled with that chemical

2015-10-24 19:01:03	Nvortex	i think it uses its gold color to attract animals and eat them
2015-10-24 19:01:15	Nvortex	just like how it captured olimar
2015-10-24 19:01:51	Nvortex	so it searches for gold to attract creatures
2015-10-24 19:02:32	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2015-10-24 19:03:18	ScruffyChat	Are they carnivorous though?
2015-10-24 19:03:35	Nvortex	who knows
2015-10-24 19:03:47	En_Passant	I didn't mind the idea of a "supernatural" influence
2015-10-24 19:03:48	Nvortex	i hope it gets a piklopedia entry in some other game
2015-10-24 19:04:22	En_Passant	Like, maybe it had biological origins, but it was mutated by radioactivity or something
2015-10-24 19:04:37	Nvortex	i thought you were going to say something about ghosts
2015-10-24 19:04:54	En_Passant	Supernatural probably isn't the best word
2015-10-24 19:04:58	En_Passant	Unnatural is better
2015-10-24 19:05:02	Nvortex	i was about to say that i tend to dismiss supernatural explanations because pikmin atleast tries to sound scientific
2015-10-24 19:05:23	En_Passant	Not natural selection/evolution
2015-10-24 19:05:49	Nvortex	maybe the geiger counter from pikmin 1 isnt ticking for whatever reason
2015-10-24 19:05:59	Nvortex	maybe the planet has high radiation levels
2015-10-24 19:06:24	Nvortex	or maybe it just evolved naturally 
2015-10-24 19:06:32	Nvortex	250 million years passed
2015-10-24 19:07:12	ScruffyChat	I never liked that Geiger counter
2015-10-24 19:07:20	ScruffyChat	There was no indication of high or low
2015-10-24 19:07:25	ScruffyChat	I think Olimar was scammed
2015-10-24 19:07:45	Nvortex	my other explanation isnt that far fetched knowing that there are biomechanical creatures

2015-10-24 19:08:46	Nvortex	basically the plasm wraith is a mass of nanobots which can alter their formation and electrical impulses to either liquify or solidify, burn, electrocute or emit signals
2015-10-24 19:09:08	Nvortex	and it searches for olimar because the cosmic drive key emits high amounts of energy
2015-10-24 19:10:04	Nvortex	there is also a nanobot layer in the atmosphere which it uses to make ships fail
2015-10-24 19:10:53	Nvortex	after all alph mentions that it felt as if something from the planet's surface was pulling us down

2015-10-24 19:14:12	ScruffyChat	I like the notion that the Hocotate ship made in P2
2015-10-24 19:14:36	ScruffyChat	That the Waterwraith was in a different dimension, and only partially linked to the one you experienced
2015-10-24 19:14:46	ScruffyChat	Although I don't think dimension is the right word
2015-10-24 19:14:57	ScruffyChat	I think it would be from an alternate universe
2015-10-24 19:16:27	Nvortex	the other explanation i have is IF the wraiths are extra dimensional beings, the plasm wraith wanted the cosmic drive key to open a portal and get completely through not just being half there
2015-10-24 19:16:51	En_Passant	But it didn't take the drive key from Olimar
2015-10-24 19:17:02	Nvortex	he had it with him
2015-10-24 19:17:12	Nvortex	he pulled it out from who knows where
2015-10-24 19:18:15	Nvortex	maybe it just wanted the energy it released and since olimar was a living being it was taking care of it or something
2015-10-24 19:18:26	En_Passant	It's just a key
2015-10-24 19:18:42	En_Passant	It turns on the cosmic drive, which is on the Drake

2015-10-24 19:50:53	En_Passant	If that's the case, then your entire theory shouldn't exist
2015-10-24 19:50:59	En_Passant	It's a mystery how Pikmin evolve
2015-10-24 19:51:08	En_Passant	By your logic, that means Pikmin evolution is impossible
2015-10-24 19:51:21	En_Passant	And they did that just to explain such a ridiculous feat
2015-10-24 19:51:35	Nvortex	yeah
2015-10-24 19:51:36	En_Passant	*just to not explain
2015-10-24 19:51:43	Nvortex	its impossible
2015-10-24 19:51:57	Nvortex	the game doesnt make sense
2015-10-24 19:52:05	Nvortex	anything from it
2015-10-24 19:52:39	En_Passant	You're using circular logic
2015-10-24 19:53:06	En_Passant	You're saying that the game makes no sense because *insert entry* doesn't make sense, and the entry doesn't make sense because the game doesn't make sense
2015-10-24 19:53:17	Nvortex	thats how this works
2015-10-24 19:53:26	En_Passant	No, it's not
2015-10-24 19:53:29	Nvortex	fantasy
2015-10-24 19:53:30	En_Passant	Circular logic is a classic fallacy
2015-10-24 19:53:52	Nvortex	science fiction =/= real world science
2015-10-24 19:54:00	En_Passant	It doesn't have to be
2015-10-24 19:54:06	En_Passant	Doesn't mean that it's automatically not
2015-10-24 19:54:11	ScruffyChat	Wait, science fiction is grounded in science
2015-10-24 19:54:30	Nvortex	but mentions things that cant happen
2015-10-24 19:55:25	ScruffyChat	Well, most science fiction tries to fill in holes in our scientific knowledge

2015-10-24 19:55:53	ScruffyChat	It's not exactly things that can't happen, but things that are very unlikely to happen given our current models
2015-10-24 19:56:35	ScruffyChat	And because we don't have enough scientific information about a subject, science fiction can suggest things that are plausible
2015-10-24 19:56:48	ScruffyChat	If fiction doesn't do this, it's fantasy, not science fiction
2015-10-24 19:56:54	ScruffyChat	Which is why Star Wars is a fantasy
2015-10-24 19:57:28	ScruffyChat	But Pikmin goes off of our uncertainty about life on other planets, and about the progress of evolution
2015-10-24 19:58:09	ScruffyChat	I'd say there are fantastical parts, but it does a good job of maintaining itself as a very far-flung science fiction
2015-10-24 19:59:49	ScruffyChat	So creating a theory about this game is perfectly reasonable, because do not have enough information to confirm whether it is possible or not
2015-10-24 20:01:33	En_Passant	We can use current knowledge to theorize whether or not such a theory is plausible, though. A perfect example is Scruffy's old idea of Onion moons
2015-10-24 20:01:44	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-24 20:02:01	ScruffyChat	The game tries to state that it does abide by our current understanding of the laws of physics
2015-10-24 20:02:11	ScruffyChat	The laws of physics in our universe, that it
2015-10-24 20:02:13	ScruffyChat	is*
2015-10-24 20:02:24	ScruffyChat	And Onion moons did not
2015-10-24 20:03:08	ScruffyChat	that does not mean Onion moons are impossible though; they are just extremely far-stretched and would require fantastical elements to hold up the theory
2015-10-24 20:03:54	ScruffyChat	In a different universe, for example, where the gravitational constant is different, they could exist
2015-10-24 20:04:44	ScruffyChat	But multiple universes are not standard science
2015-10-24 20:05:43	ScruffyChat	And certainly not current knowledge
2015-10-24 20:06:16	ScruffyChat	So I changed it to something that could be better explained scientifically
2015-10-24 20:06:27	En_Passant	If we could manipulate the constant, that would work, too
2015-10-24 20:06:33	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-24 20:06:51	ScruffyChat	There is evidence of our laws of physics fluctuating slightly throughout the life of the universe
2015-10-24 20:07:16	ScruffyChat	But no one thing can control it
2015-10-24 20:07:24	ScruffyChat	that exists within the universe
2015-10-24 20:08:45	ScruffyChat	Unless I were to say that Pikmin could manipulate gravity in such a way
2015-10-24 20:08:53	ScruffyChat	Which would be a bit fantastical
2015-10-24 20:09:21	Nvortex	any progress on the new plot?
2015-10-24 20:09:33	ScruffyChat	No, it's troubling me
2015-10-24 20:09:58	ScruffyChat	I want to keep things naturally sound
2015-10-24 20:10:08	Nvortex	have you tried mythology? (Except without using magic)
2015-10-24 20:10:29	En_Passant	New plot?
2015-10-24 20:10:35	Nvortex	for pikmin forever
2015-10-24 20:10:38	ScruffyChat	I could make a new plot
2015-10-24 20:11:29	ScruffyChat	Mythology? what do you mean
2015-10-24 20:11:42	ScruffyChat	I have about 20 minutes, sorry

2015-10-24 20:12:12	Nvortex	like inspired in something mentioned in some sort of mythology 
2015-10-24 20:12:18	Nvortex	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life
2015-10-24 20:12:23	Nvortex	(not an example)
2015-10-24 20:12:35	Nvortex	just the name sounded familiar
2015-10-24 20:12:56	ScruffyChat	I once thought the Odyssey (although an epic, not a myth) would make a good Pikmin plot
2015-10-24 20:13:15	ScruffyChat	Except that would involve Olimar's wife being troubled by suitors, which is not a Nintendo-y theme
2015-10-24 20:14:29	ScruffyChat	Well, whatever the plot is to become, I want to keep the moment in which Olimar impacts with a cloud of Onions, causing him to crash-land
2015-10-24 20:14:54	Nvortex	but no onion moons?
2015-10-24 20:15:17	Nvortex	have you decided that the final boss will be the mongret?
2015-10-24 20:15:35	Nvortex	and "hacking" life will be the theme?
2015-10-24 20:15:54	En_Passant	I've clearly missed some conversations
2015-10-24 20:15:54	ScruffyChat	1.No 2.No 3.I don't know :(
2015-10-24 20:16:32	ScruffyChat	Onion moons can't exist unless they have the same specifications as our current moon
2015-10-24 20:17:00	ScruffyChat	I haven't even decided what the Mongret is, so really it could be any boss
2015-10-24 20:17:17	Nvortex	the mongret(name subject to change) is a parasite fungus that infects the pikmin tree and gets the DNA from the whole planet
2015-10-24 20:17:23	En_Passant	I thought we agreed that Onion moons can't exist at all
2015-10-24 20:17:23	Nvortex	(to en passant)
2015-10-24 20:17:31	ScruffyChat	Yes, they can't
2015-10-24 20:17:39	ScruffyChat	Even if they orbited Earth they couldnt'
2015-10-24 20:17:46	ScruffyChat	They couldn't grow from nothing
2015-10-24 20:17:59	Nvortex	i thought they grew from onions
2015-10-24 20:18:00	ScruffyChat	And their point is weak
2015-10-24 20:18:06	En_Passant	They couldn't launch
2015-10-24 20:18:09	ScruffyChat	But onions can't get something from nothing
2015-10-24 20:18:12	ScruffyChat	Another point
2015-10-24 20:18:27	Nvortex	gravitational assist
2015-10-24 20:18:41	ScruffyChat	Gravity can't repel
2015-10-24 20:18:46	En_Passant	Once they got large enough, their own gravitational field would cause problems
2015-10-24 20:18:49	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-24 20:18:57	Nvortex	also if they keep using the propellers the onions have they would eventually reach really high velocity
2015-10-24 20:19:09	Nvortex	wait, how big are they?
2015-10-24 20:19:16	Nvortex	i thought they were small...
2015-10-24 20:19:18	ScruffyChat	Too small to have their own gravity
2015-10-24 20:19:23	En_Passant	They were going to become planets
2015-10-24 20:19:38	ScruffyChat	But if they were big enough, they'd mess up Earth
2015-10-24 20:19:41	Nvortex	i thought they were going to colonize the planets not make them
2015-10-24 20:19:47	ScruffyChat	And they'd have to get really big
2015-10-24 20:20:07	ScruffyChat	The KHA wanted to colonize, Pikmin wanted to spread life
2015-10-24 20:20:19	Nvortex	i ddint know which word to use
2015-10-24 20:20:25	En_Passant	Colonizing planets with Onion moons wouldn't work either
2015-10-24 20:20:53	En_Passant	They'd have to be already suited for life, which currently, none are other than Earth
2015-10-24 20:21:20	Nvortex	what if they became something like the meteorite that starte life on earth
2015-10-24 20:21:55	ScruffyChat	They couldn't gain enough velocity to escape Earth
2015-10-24 20:22:12	ScruffyChat	And if they could, it's likely life wouldn't even survive
2015-10-24 20:22:20	Nvortex	regular onions already do
2015-10-24 20:22:20	ScruffyChat	Pikmin aren't extremophiles
2015-10-24 20:22:30	Nvortex	they fly really high
2015-10-24 20:22:44	ScruffyChat	But not enough to escape Earth gravity
2015-10-24 20:22:49	Nvortex	its a bit exaggerated the distance onions fly in pikmin 3
2015-10-24 20:23:00	ScruffyChat	There's a velocity you have to hit to escape
2015-10-24 20:23:07	Nvortex	true
2015-10-24 20:23:47	ScruffyChat	But yes, I'm through with Onion moons
2015-10-24 20:24:05	En_Passant	They only escape the clouds, which is about 80 km out of 1000
2015-10-24 20:24:05	Testyo	80 km = 49.712 mi
2015-10-24 20:24:15	En_Passant	According to Wikipedia, at least
2015-10-24 20:24:23	ScruffyChat	Truth be told, the main reason I thought of them was that I wanted to combine Pikmin with the elements of Super Mario Galaxy
2015-10-24 20:24:39	Nvortex	but you can see almost all of the planet from there
2015-10-24 20:24:55	ScruffyChat	Earth's field is huge

2015-10-24 20:27:31	ScruffyChat	But currently, the plot tells me that the final area is at the summit of a mountain, above which the cloud of Onions is guarding something
2015-10-24 20:27:55	En_Passant	Pikmin 3 also had single-biome continents
2015-10-24 20:28:13	En_Passant	Summit of a mountain? That wouldn't be very hidden
2015-10-24 20:28:23	ScruffyChat	I know, that's the problem
2015-10-24 20:28:33	En_Passant	I liked the idea of a hidden valley
2015-10-24 20:28:41	ScruffyChat	Well that was the thing
2015-10-24 20:28:51	ScruffyChat	It was a bowl gouged of the summit
2015-10-24 20:29:08	ScruffyChat	like the cauldron of an inactive volcano
2015-10-24 20:29:51	ScruffyChat	And it'd be really epic to place a lone tree there

2015-10-24 20:58:57	ScruffyM	So, PikFan, the tree would be on a landmass of its own?
2015-10-24 20:59:02	ScruffyM	Like an island?
2015-10-24 20:59:13	Nvortex	a floating island in the sea
2015-10-24 20:59:16	Nvortex	wouldnt that be cool
2015-10-24 20:59:32	Nvortex	that would let them be safe
2015-10-24 20:59:40	@PikFan	Scruffy: yeah
2015-10-24 20:59:50	Nvortex	o but...plants cant drink salt water
2015-10-24 21:00:02	Nvortex	salt molecules are bigger than water miolecules
2015-10-24 21:00:12	Nvortex	the roots get clogged
2015-10-24 21:00:49	ScruffyM	It could be like that island in life of pi
2015-10-24 21:00:58	ScruffyM	If anyone read that book
2015-10-24 21:01:04	Nvortex	theres a movie
2015-10-24 21:01:07	En_Passant	or saw the movie
2015-10-24 21:01:09	En_Passant	I did neither
2015-10-24 21:01:23	En_Passant	Also, aren't crater lakes freshwater?
2015-10-24 21:01:35	Nvortex	what?
2015-10-24 21:01:37	En_Passant	That would be a good place
2015-10-24 21:01:39	Nvortex	oh
2015-10-24 21:01:40	Nvortex	yeah
2015-10-24 21:02:05	En_Passant	Forgot for a moment that I hadn't proposed having it be on one of those
2015-10-24 21:02:08	ScruffyM	Yes
2015-10-24 21:02:11	Nvortex	it says heer that its acidic
2015-10-24 21:02:14	Nvortex	so i guess not
2015-10-24 21:02:33	Nvortex	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_lake
2015-10-24 21:03:43	ScruffyM	For extinct volcanic craters the water is clear
2015-10-24 21:03:53	ScruffyM	Wouldn't that be something
2015-10-24 21:04:28	ScruffyM	So yeah, the team doesn'tneed to ascend a mountain to find Edward
2015-10-24 21:04:39	ScruffyM	They just need the Kha lander to locate Edward
2015-10-24 21:04:48	@PikFan	I think I mentioned Crater Lake once
2015-10-24 21:04:58	ScruffyM	And they find he's in a tree in the middle of a crater lake

2015-10-24 21:11:22	ScruffyM	So Olimar and co repair the KHA lander and find that Edward is in a Pikmin tree at the center of a freshwater volcanic lake
2015-10-24 21:11:35	ScruffyM	Perhaps the boss is some giant fungal fish
2015-10-24 21:11:52	En_Passant	... what?
2015-10-24 21:12:17	En_Passant	What even is that?

2015-10-24 21:12:27	ScruffyM	It's*
2015-10-24 21:12:40	En_Passant	A fish on an island?
2015-10-24 21:13:18	ScruffyM	Hmm
2015-10-24 21:13:26	ScruffyM	Some such tropical animal, maybe
2015-10-24 21:13:52	En_Passant	Maybe a reptile?
2015-10-24 21:13:56	ScruffyM	Yeah
2015-10-24 21:13:59	En_Passant	A lizard or snake?
2015-10-24 21:14:24	En_Passant	Snake might work with a Yggdrasil symbol

2015-10-24 21:15:34	@PikFan	Thanks, mibbit
2015-10-24 21:16:00	ScruffyM	PikFan: newest final boss idea is a big fungal snake
2015-10-24 21:17:20	ScruffyM	And now just as easily it could be a big fungal Snavian
2015-10-24 21:17:51	@PikFan	Hmmmmm
2015-10-24 21:18:00	En_Passant	Why does it have to be fungal?
2015-10-24 21:18:02	@PikFan	What about the roots?
2015-10-24 21:18:06	Nvortex	en passant, water fungi exist
2015-10-24 21:18:20	ScruffyM	It's parasitic
2015-10-24 21:18:29	ScruffyM	Loving off the tree
2015-10-24 21:18:32	ScruffyM	Living*
2015-10-24 21:18:34	Nvortex	hue
2015-10-24 21:18:36	@PikFan	Lol
2015-10-24 21:19:43	En_Passant	Not all parasites are fungi
2015-10-24 21:20:17	Nvortex	oh no i just meant to say that water fungi do exist
2015-10-24 21:20:37	ScruffyM	No, but I had a hard time finding an animal that didn't give back to the tree it used
2015-10-24 21:20:55	ScruffyM	That actually harmed the tree

2015-10-24 21:22:27	@PikFan	En_Passant: For the sake of simplicity I think we should just leave it as a fungus
2015-10-24 21:24:09	Nvortex	could the breadbugs count as kleptoparasites?
2015-10-24 21:26:43	En_Passant	I guess they could
2015-10-24 21:26:51	En_Passant	They're more of a scavenger, though
2015-10-24 21:27:37	En_Passant	PikFan: What's simple about a fungal snake?
2015-10-24 21:27:44	En_Passant	Like, is it a snake-like fungus?
2015-10-24 21:27:49	Nvortex	yes
2015-10-24 21:27:52	En_Passant	A snake parasitized by a fungus?
2015-10-24 21:27:57	Nvortex	wait you talking about the mognret?
2015-10-24 21:28:03	Nvortex	its supposed to be a fungus
2015-10-24 21:28:04	En_Passant	yes
2015-10-24 21:28:13	Nvortex	that looks like a sangret
2015-10-24 21:28:22	En_Passant	Why be a snake shape when you can just grow in the tree and spread?
2015-10-24 21:28:23	Nvortex	mongret is a combinaton of monster and snagret
2015-10-24 21:29:39	@PikFan	Simple as in we don't have to go looking for anything else that could be a parasite
2015-10-24 21:29:40	Nvortex	i dont know if he decided on what i told him but basically, by infecting the pikmin tree it gained access to the dna of the whole planet letting it alter its own genetic sequence to gain abilities from other creatures
2015-10-24 21:29:53	Nvortex	or something like that , i dont remember i said it 2 weeks ago
2015-10-24 21:31:40	@PikFan	Also, the snake could represent the "brain" of the fungus
2015-10-24 21:32:00	@PikFan	Kill the snake, and the rest of the infection dies
2015-10-24 21:33:29	En_Passant	That sounds like a poor evolutionary choice
2015-10-24 21:33:37	@PikFan	So?
2015-10-24 21:33:55	@PikFan	It doesn't have to be absolutely realistic
2015-10-24 21:34:06	@PikFan	Or make sense

2015-10-24 21:34:29	En_Passant	It should make sense
2015-10-24 21:34:47	En_Passant	We had this conversation before you arrived
2015-10-24 21:35:44	En_Passant	Also, it's the same reason why Onion moons no longer exist
2015-10-24 21:35:47	@PikFan	A lot of things about a lot of video games don't make sense
2015-10-24 21:36:13	@PikFan	If video games made sense all the time, then they wouldn't really be very fun IMO
2015-10-24 21:36:33	En_Passant	Pikmin's not the same as a lot of video games
2015-10-24 21:36:38	Nvortex	<En_Passant>: That sounds like a poor evolutionary choice
2015-10-24 21:36:41	Nvortex	skitterleaf?
2015-10-24 21:37:03	@PikFan	Right, but it's no exception
2015-10-24 21:37:04	En_Passant	What about it?
2015-10-24 21:37:12	En_Passant	It has camouflage
2015-10-24 21:37:16	Nvortex	also the shape it took could be caused by a mutation with the tree
2015-10-24 21:37:33	@PikFan	The fact that you can store tens of thousands of Pikmin in an Onion doesn't make sense
2015-10-24 21:37:35	Nvortex	<En_Passant>: It has camouflage      but now its useless in the water
2015-10-24 21:37:42	Nvortex	the places where its more commonly found
2015-10-24 21:37:47	@PikFan	Pikmin THEMSELVES don't make sense
2015-10-24 21:37:52	Nvortex	<PikFan>: The fact that you can store tens of thousands of Pikmin in an Onion doesn't make sense
2015-10-24 21:37:55	Nvortex	they are stored as lquid
2015-10-24 21:38:01	Nvortex	for easier transport
2015-10-24 21:38:08	@PikFan	That's speculation
2015-10-24 21:38:10	Nvortex	how? who knows
2015-10-24 21:38:13	Nvortex	no, alph mentions it
2015-10-24 21:38:18	En_Passant	He theorizes
2015-10-24 21:38:23	En_Passant	He doesn't actually know
2015-10-24 21:38:26	Nvortex	the juices inside the onion are the pikmin
2015-10-24 21:38:30	Nvortex	and onion soup
2015-10-24 21:38:50	Nvortex	well theres really no other explanation
2015-10-24 21:39:29	En_Passant	Both of you have this idea that if something isn't mentioned in canon, that it's automatically false
2015-10-24 21:39:42	Nvortex	what?
2015-10-24 21:40:09	@PikFan	Still, even if they were liquid, I can't imagine how you would store ten thousand liquified Pikmin in an Onion, which is at best one thousand times a Pikmin's volume
2015-10-24 21:40:20	En_Passant	How Pikmin work only doesn't make sense because we don't know a lot about them
2015-10-24 21:41:18	@PikFan	Yes, I do have that idea
2015-10-24 21:41:27	En_Passant	As for your point, PikFan, there's gameplay and story segregation to consider
2015-10-24 21:41:41	En_Passant	How much would it suck to have a Pikmin cap?
2015-10-24 21:42:13	Nvortex	i suppose that we dont see onions swell because its a game but in the in game logic it does, just like bulborbs supposedly eat small bugs but we never se them do that in game
2015-10-24 21:42:22	@PikFan	For the Onions? Depends on how low the cap is
2015-10-24 21:44:30	En_Passant	Say, 300. Chugga's already almost hit that cap with Winged Pikmin in his LP, and he wasn't even trying
2015-10-24 21:45:03	Nvortex	i dont like how he isnt making the rock population grow
2015-10-24 21:45:10	@PikFan	Divide by 5, then
2015-10-24 21:45:17	Nvortex	you can beat the plasm wraith without any type but rocks
2015-10-24 21:45:39	Nvortex	you can beat the plasm wraith with only rocks*
2015-10-24 21:45:46	Nvortex	i suppose that sentence makes more sense
2015-10-24 21:45:49	@PikFan	It'd be inconvenient to only have 60 of each type, but I'd manage
2015-10-24 21:46:22	En_Passant	I meant 300 each
2015-10-24 21:46:39	En_Passant	But 300 total would ruin the game
2015-10-24 21:46:50	@PikFan	Also, you run into problems when you max out the cap and you discover a new Pikmin type
2015-10-24 21:47:01	@PikFan	Oh
2015-10-24 21:47:09	En_Passant	Well, 300 per Onion
2015-10-24 21:47:28	@PikFan	Well, I don't usually grow more than 100 of each type anyway
2015-10-24 21:48:16	En_Passant	Good for you. Doesn't mean it's acceptable for everyone
2015-10-24 21:48:38	@PikFan	I'm aware
2015-10-24 21:49:26	@PikFan	I don't see how all this is relevant to the final boss
2015-10-24 21:50:15	En_Passant	You're the one that mentioned storing Pikmin in Onions
2015-10-24 21:50:34	Nvortex	i was just mentioning that i dont like how he leaves rocks behind when they are the most useful type againts the final boss
2015-10-24 21:50:45	Nvortex	talking about chuggaa
2015-10-24 21:51:10	En_Passant	You said that it doesn't make sense to not have a cap, used it to justify how the final boss makes no sense, and I refuted that there's no cap for gameplay purposes
2015-10-24 21:51:52	@PikFan	Yeah but I was just using that as an example of things that doesn't make sense
2015-10-24 21:51:53	En_Passant	Nvortex: Yeah, and they're really good in battle.
2015-10-24 21:52:36	En_Passant	I'm saying that's a bad example of things not making sense
2015-10-24 21:53:31	@PikFan	Also, if you're going to say that it doesn't make sense for the sake of gameplay purposes, then the same thing can be said for the final boss, too
2015-10-24 21:53:50	En_Passant	Whether the final boss is a snake or a snake-shaped fungus has no impact on gameplay
2015-10-24 21:54:31	@PikFan	But it can
2015-10-24 21:55:07	En_Passant	And would it being a fungus be better for gameplay?
2015-10-24 21:55:12	@PikFan	A fungus snake could attack very differently than just a regular snake
2015-10-24 21:55:58	Nvortex	its not a snake anymore
2015-10-24 21:56:10	@PikFan	True
2015-10-24 21:56:21	Nvortex	he hasnt decided on how it would look 
2015-10-24 21:56:23	@PikFan	But it would be shaped like one
2015-10-24 21:56:34	@PikFan	Oh
2015-10-24 21:56:35	Nvortex	the last version was a snavian
2015-10-24 21:56:41	Nvortex	now he cant decide
2015-10-24 21:56:58	Nvortex	i refer to it as it was last described
2015-10-24 21:57:30	En_Passant	Also, he's not even here, why are we discussing it
2015-10-24 21:58:21	@PikFan	To further flesh out our suggestions

2015-10-25 01:28:16	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-25 01:28:20	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-25 01:28:34	@PikFan	so me and En Passant were arguing earlier over your final boss
2015-10-25 01:29:01	ScruffyChat	Arguing? I hope it didn't get too bad
2015-10-25 01:29:08	@PikFan	it didn't
2015-10-25 01:29:13	ScruffyChat	Good
2015-10-25 01:29:26	ScruffyChat	So how did it go?
2015-10-25 01:29:29	@PikFan	maybe "argue" is too harsh
2015-10-25 01:29:34	@PikFan	just a disagreement, really
2015-10-25 01:29:36	@PikFan	well
2015-10-25 01:29:53	@PikFan	I think that you should still use a fungus
2015-10-25 01:30:06	@PikFan	even if it is related to a snake in some way
2015-10-25 01:30:17	@PikFan	and he said that doesn't make evolutionary sense
2015-10-25 01:30:20	@PikFan	but I mean
2015-10-25 01:30:26	@PikFan	a lot of things in video games make sense
2015-10-25 01:30:36	@PikFan	so...
2015-10-25 01:30:51	@PikFan	*don't make sense
2015-10-25 01:31:39	@PikFan	I'm just defensive over your ideas because I like them
2015-10-25 01:31:46	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2015-10-25 01:32:02	ScruffyChat	Whatever it is, I just think it should be detrimental to the tree
2015-10-25 01:32:07	@PikFan	not to be rude towards En Passant, but it feels like he isn't happy with almost any of your ideas
2015-10-25 01:32:34	@PikFan	sorry, I don't mean to drag you into our drama
2015-10-25 01:32:37	@PikFan	and yes, I agree
2015-10-25 01:32:51	@PikFan	it should also interact with the roots in some way
2015-10-25 01:33:05	@PikFan	I mean, it doesn't have to, but it would be interesting
2015-10-25 01:33:11	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 01:33:27	ScruffyChat	Otherwise, I don't know how the battle would include all types of Pikmin
2015-10-25 01:33:37	@PikFan	right
2015-10-25 01:33:56	@PikFan	this is really handy by the way http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/stuff/irc-logs/pikipedia/017.txt
2015-10-25 01:34:46	@PikFan	I'm still leaning towards something like a Snagret, since it would able to quickly travel towards the tree
2015-10-25 01:34:52	@PikFan	and yet...
2015-10-25 01:35:01	@PikFan	I also like the idea of a fungus
2015-10-25 01:35:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 01:35:14	@PikFan	but I'm not sure how to combine the two
2015-10-25 01:35:20	ScruffyChat	What does En_Passant think the boss should be?
2015-10-25 01:35:45	@PikFan	let me grab some logs
2015-10-25 01:35:48	ScruffyChat	Perhaps I can find a median
2015-10-25 01:35:54	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2015-10-25 01:36:30	@PikFan	meanwhile... I haven't made progress on my game lately
2015-10-25 01:36:35	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2015-10-25 01:36:49	@PikFan	it's not your fault that I'm lazy :P
2015-10-25 01:36:53	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2015-10-25 01:37:13	@PikFan	I just need to force myself to think
2015-10-25 01:38:27	ScruffyChat	Game making is hard
2015-10-25 01:38:30	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/zjJYaJvs
2015-10-25 01:38:39	@PikFan	especially when you're by yourself
2015-10-25 01:38:44	@PikFan	actually, this reminds me
2015-10-25 01:39:05	@PikFan	I had the thought that maybe you, En Passant, and I could make a game together
2015-10-25 01:40:33	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 01:40:39	ScruffyChat	A standalone
2015-10-25 01:42:41	ScruffyChat	Wait, a Pikmin fangame? Or an actual game?
2015-10-25 01:43:03	@PikFan	fangame
2015-10-25 01:43:06	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-25 01:43:22	@PikFan	hopefully an actual game, if progress on the engine goes well
2015-10-25 01:43:31	@PikFan	I'd like to be able to make my own game as well
2015-10-25 01:43:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 01:44:57	ScruffyChat	I've played the latest revisions and they're really cool, Espyo's amazing at programming
2015-10-25 01:45:06	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 01:45:19	@PikFan	we've got some really great users in the community
2015-10-25 01:45:38	ScruffyChat	I agree
2015-10-25 01:45:56	ScruffyChat	You guys are all really insightful and friendly
2015-10-25 01:46:07	@PikFan	a couple of users are going to colleges that specialize in game design
2015-10-25 01:46:11	ScruffyChat	Pikipedia and Pikmin Fanon were the first wikis I joined
2015-10-25 01:46:12	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 01:46:17	@PikFan	oh, really? wow
2015-10-25 01:46:39	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 01:46:47	@PikFan	you really know your way with wiki text considering they're the first wikis you joined
2015-10-25 01:46:49	ScruffyChat	I knew nothing about editing or Wiki programming
2015-10-25 01:46:54	ScruffyChat	I learned fast
2015-10-25 01:47:00	@PikFan	ah, good to hear
2015-10-25 01:47:26	@PikFan	I've been on the wikis for over 4 years and I still have a hard time with templates
2015-10-25 01:47:32	@PikFan	i.e. making templates
2015-10-25 01:47:47	ScruffyChat	Well, making templates is not my forte, but I get using them at least
2015-10-25 01:47:52	@PikFan	same
2015-10-25 01:48:51	ScruffyChat	But yeah everyone hear knows a lot about game design
2015-10-25 01:49:10	@PikFan	everyone that's active in Fanon, that is
2015-10-25 01:49:17	ScruffyChat	Really this and Blender for me were the upgrade from LittleBigPlanet
2015-10-25 01:49:27	@PikFan	I'm not too sure about the Skype folk, since I can't use Skype
2015-10-25 01:49:29	@PikFan	neat
2015-10-25 01:49:53	ScruffyChat	I have Skype, but just forget to use it
2015-10-25 01:50:00	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-10-25 01:51:17	ScruffyChat	But I can't thank you guys enough for helping me mold Pikmin Forever
2015-10-25 01:51:24	ScruffyChat	It's teaching me a lot about game design
2015-10-25 01:51:39	@PikFan	no problem, I'm actually excited to see how it ends up
2015-10-25 01:51:54	ScruffyChat	I can think of something that'll wow the audience, but I'm not as great at making sure it's fun and balanced to play
2015-10-25 01:51:55	@PikFan	the community can't thank you enough for making all these renders
2015-10-25 01:52:06	ScruffyChat	:)
2015-10-25 01:52:23	ScruffyChat	It's my pleasure, with each one I learn a new thing about renderingh
2015-10-25 01:52:34	@PikFan	yay
2015-10-25 01:53:24	ScruffyChat	Enough about my game though, I'd like to help with yours
2015-10-25 01:53:46	ScruffyChat	But first I need to upload a render real quick
2015-10-25 01:53:50	@PikFan	oh, sure
2015-10-25 01:53:50	ScruffyChat	It's a new enemy
2015-10-25 01:53:53	@PikFan	ooh
2015-10-25 01:53:57	@PikFan	what is it?
2015-10-25 01:54:09	ScruffyChat	the "Chambered Sprawn"
2015-10-25 01:54:20	@PikFan	it sounds... exquisite
2015-10-25 01:54:20	ScruffyChat	Although its shell isn't chambered, so that's going to change
2015-10-25 01:56:31	ScruffyChat	http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/7/70/Sprawn.png
2015-10-25 01:56:44	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-25 01:56:51	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-25 01:57:05	ScruffyChat	It slithers along
2015-10-25 01:57:10	ScruffyChat	But when it spots Pikmin
2015-10-25 01:57:16	@PikFan	I assume that when it feels threatened, it'll suck itself up into the shell?
2015-10-25 01:57:22	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-25 01:57:27	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-25 01:57:31	ScruffyChat	But it hops up backward
2015-10-25 01:57:36	ScruffyChat	And drills its shell into the ground
2015-10-25 01:57:54	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-25 01:57:54	ScruffyChat	And after a variable amount of time its gelatinous body springs out of the ground
2015-10-25 01:58:08	@PikFan	so in order to defeat it, you have to act quickly
2015-10-25 01:58:09	ScruffyChat	And sprays in a range in front of it
2015-10-25 01:58:11	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-25 01:58:24	ScruffyChat	Or else it'll capture pikmin caught in its sticky underside
2015-10-25 01:58:29	@PikFan	right
2015-10-25 01:59:44	ScruffyChat	So the quickest way is to hit it with a Rock Pikmin
2015-10-25 01:59:53	ScruffyChat	Or you could break down its shell with Lichen Pikmin
2015-10-25 02:01:05	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 02:02:56	ScruffyChat	I'm not really sure how you would attack it with regular Pikmin though
2015-10-25 02:03:09	@PikFan	you couldn't
2015-10-25 02:03:29	@PikFan	if it's got a gelatinous body, then Pikmin would drown in it
2015-10-25 02:03:47	ScruffyChat	Well, it's sort of a membrane
2015-10-25 02:03:55	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 02:04:08	@PikFan	hm, it looks like a puddle to me, but alright
2015-10-25 02:04:12	ScruffyChat	It's like that stuff that makes up the hand toy that you can stick to windows
2015-10-25 02:04:41	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-25 02:31:22	ScruffyChat	I hafta get going
2015-10-25 02:31:29	@PikFan	alright
2015-10-25 02:31:30	@PikFan	night
2015-10-25 02:31:44	ScruffyChat	I'll probably be on tomorrow though, maybe we can settle on this final boss once and for all
2015-10-25 02:31:55	@PikFan	sounds good
2015-10-25 02:31:59	ScruffyChat	Cool
2015-10-25 02:32:05	ScruffyChat	Thanks, good night
2015-10-25 02:32:09	@PikFan	night

2015-10-25 18:40:38	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-25 18:40:48	@PikFan	ok, so earlier I had this really wacky idea
2015-10-25 18:41:05	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-25 18:41:20	@PikFan	my idea was that if you lost a lot of Pikmin (say, 50 or more, something around there) in a short period of time
2015-10-25 18:41:39	@PikFan	then the Onions would go berserk and destroy the captains' ship 
2015-10-25 18:41:43	@PikFan	and you get a game over
2015-10-25 18:42:05	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-25 18:42:30	ScruffyChat	I mean, it fits the gravity of losing over 50 Pikmin
2015-10-25 18:42:38	ScruffyChat	But it also might discourage the player
2015-10-25 18:42:45	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 18:42:51	@PikFan	like I said, it's wacky
2015-10-25 18:43:54	ScruffyChat	Heh, yeah
2015-10-25 18:44:02	ScruffyChat	A hardcore Pikmin game, perhaps
2015-10-25 18:44:32	@PikFan	it would certainly encourage the player to not lose a lot of Pikmin
2015-10-25 18:44:39	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-25 18:44:43	@PikFan	but might discourage them from not playing the game at all
2015-10-25 18:44:47	@PikFan	as you said
2015-10-25 18:45:08	ScruffyChat	Right, a simple accident with throwing one Pikmin with a bomb rock could end the game
2015-10-25 18:45:14	ScruffyChat	Although that encourages people to quit anyway
2015-10-25 18:45:25	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 18:45:46	ScruffyChat	I confess in P1 I didn't know there was a bomb-rock in my squad when I attacked one measly Shearwig
2015-10-25 18:45:50	ScruffyChat	I lost 94 Pikmin
2015-10-25 18:45:54	@PikFan	o.o
2015-10-25 18:47:23	ScruffyChat	I think it's pretty obvious I ended that day early
2015-10-25 18:47:37	@PikFan	I would've reset immediately
2015-10-25 18:47:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I just started the day over
2015-10-25 18:54:00	ScruffyChat	I've been searching for quite a while on organisms that could make good final bosses
2015-10-25 18:54:29	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-25 18:55:47	ScruffyChat	I still really think including fungus is a good idea, like a rust fungus
2015-10-25 18:55:51	ScruffyChat	They just look so unnatrual
2015-10-25 18:55:57	ScruffyChat	unnatural*
2015-10-25 18:55:58	ScruffyChat	And alien
2015-10-25 18:56:16	ScruffyChat	The cedar apple rust was a particularly cool candidate
2015-10-25 18:56:25	ScruffyChat	http://discovermagazine.com/~/media/import/images/6/2/1/cedarrust.jpg
2015-10-25 18:56:44	@PikFan	wow
2015-10-25 18:56:50	ScruffyChat	And it doesn't have to be the fungus itself, but that would help
2015-10-25 18:56:58	ScruffyChat	Help make it seem unwelcome
2015-10-25 18:57:03	@PikFan	what is a rust fungus, anyway?
2015-10-25 18:57:26	ScruffyChat	Spores of a rust fungus create "rust" (like orange discoloration) on a plant
2015-10-25 18:57:30	ScruffyChat	And cause fruit lesions
2015-10-25 18:58:18	ScruffyChat	It'd be perfect as an antagonist to the Pikmin tree
2015-10-25 18:58:32	ScruffyChat	Since it would malform fruiting Onions
2015-10-25 18:58:42	@PikFan	right
2015-10-25 19:00:17	ScruffyChat	I could combine that with some tropical animal and get a good boss
2015-10-25 19:00:29	ScruffyChat	But I'm just never finding one that seems final
2015-10-25 19:00:29	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-25 19:00:37	@PikFan	yeah...
2015-10-25 19:01:01	ScruffyChat	The way the story is going, this island sort of comes out of nowhere
2015-10-25 19:01:08	ScruffyChat	But then again, so did the Formidable Oak
2015-10-25 19:01:41	@PikFan	oh, you want it to be a tropical animal because it's on an island
2015-10-25 19:01:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 19:02:04	@PikFan	I was thinking you wanted a tropical animal because of their bright colors (if they even have bright colors)
2015-10-25 19:02:38	ScruffyChat	Not really, the coloration doesn't matter yet
2015-10-25 19:02:50	ScruffyChat	I need to figure out a boss that provides closure first
2015-10-25 19:04:08	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-25 19:04:31	ScruffyChat	Like, the LLL was impossible, but it had closure
2015-10-25 19:04:50	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 19:04:52	ScruffyChat	What else could you take on after defeating a planetoid spider?
2015-10-25 19:05:04	@PikFan	a human
2015-10-25 19:05:09	@PikFan	just kidding
2015-10-25 19:05:17	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-10-25 19:07:47	ScruffyChat	But then again, fungus doesn't have to be the answer
2015-10-25 19:07:56	ScruffyChat	It could just be a really powerful pest
2015-10-25 19:08:03	ScruffyChat	That eats the tree and its fruit
2015-10-25 19:08:17	@PikFan	sure, maybe
2015-10-25 19:08:29	@PikFan	but I like where you're going with the rust fungus
2015-10-25 19:08:42	@PikFan	since you're emphasizing how parasitic and alien it is
2015-10-25 19:09:36	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-10-25 19:10:02	ScruffyChat	Maybe this animal has made a home out of fungus
2015-10-25 19:10:13	ScruffyChat	Or controlled by fungus like ants
2015-10-25 19:11:58	-->	En_Passant (Mibbit@65-68-17-608.hlrn.qwest.net) has joined #pikipedia
2015-10-25 19:12:08	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant
2015-10-25 19:12:16	@PikFan	wait, what do you mean, like ants? I don't understand
2015-10-25 19:12:21	@PikFan	hi En_Passant
2015-10-25 19:12:39	ScruffyChat	Ants can be infected by spores; they grow fungal horns on their heads
2015-10-25 19:12:50	@PikFan	really? interesting
2015-10-25 19:12:59	@PikFan	they'd have to be pretty big ants, though
2015-10-25 19:13:03	ScruffyChat	And their minds are controlled so that they only want to travel where it is moist and dark
2015-10-25 19:13:18	ScruffyChat	Not really, it can happen to most army ants in the Amazon
2015-10-25 19:13:46	ScruffyChat	Other ants in the colony recognize when this happens, and they specifically lead that ant away from the nest to avoid the spores spreading
2015-10-25 19:14:22	En_Passant	Haven't you played Pokemon?
2015-10-25 19:14:23	@PikFan	no, I'm just saying they'd have to be big ants in order to compare to Pikmin
2015-10-25 19:14:33	@PikFan	most ants are smaller than Pikmin
2015-10-25 19:15:40	En_Passant	It could always infect a larger animal
2015-10-25 19:15:54	ScruffyChat	Ants are my go-to example
2015-10-25 19:16:01	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 19:16:06	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-10-25 19:16:13	ScruffyChat	They're really neat
2015-10-25 19:16:41	ScruffyChat	They have internal compasses, wherever they go they can always sniff out a straight line to their nest
2015-10-25 19:17:12	ScruffyChat	Well, as long as they aren't ''too'' far displaced
2015-10-25 19:17:19	ScruffyChat	How do you embolden text?
2015-10-25 19:17:32	@PikFan	use two asterisks
2015-10-25 19:17:36	@PikFan	*example*
2015-10-25 19:17:47	ScruffyChat	**ah**
2015-10-25 19:17:54	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 19:18:09	@PikFan	and then you can use slashes if you want to use italics
2015-10-25 19:18:17	@PikFan	/example
2015-10-25 19:18:21	@PikFan	/example/
2015-10-25 19:18:34	ScruffyChat	 /okay/
2015-10-25 19:18:37	@PikFan	or underscores for underlining
2015-10-25 19:18:41	@PikFan	_test_
2015-10-25 19:18:49	ScruffyChat	_cool_
2015-10-25 19:18:52	@PikFan	anyway
2015-10-25 19:19:06	ScruffyChat	Well En_Passant, I heard and saw you and PikFan debated the final boss
2015-10-25 19:19:14	ScruffyChat	I've been trying to settle this all day
2015-10-25 19:19:26	ScruffyChat	I can't find a boss that delivers enough closure to the game
2015-10-25 19:19:55	ScruffyChat	The reason I focused on fungus was because it looks unnatural and alien, certainly unwelcome
2015-10-25 19:20:07	ScruffyChat	and it causes fruit lesions, which in this case would deform Onions
2015-10-25 19:20:12	En_Passant	hmm
2015-10-25 19:20:25	En_Passant	I have an idea
2015-10-25 19:20:42	En_Passant	Maybe have there be a first attempt before Edward that's an unmanned drone
2015-10-25 19:20:52	En_Passant	Said drone shows up as the final boss, attacking the tree
2015-10-25 19:20:58	En_Passant	Or something like that
2015-10-25 19:21:06	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2015-10-25 19:21:20	En_Passant	A machine of some sort that will drive home the idea that there shouldn't be any intervention on the planet
2015-10-25 19:21:30	ScruffyChat	Yes, that's true
2015-10-25 19:21:38	@PikFan	like, tearing apart the tree to find Edward?
2015-10-25 19:21:47	ScruffyChat	The machine just wants Edward, it doesn't care if there's a tree in the way
2015-10-25 19:22:12	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-25 19:22:14	@PikFan	wait
2015-10-25 19:22:24	@PikFan	why would Edward be in the tree in the first place?
2015-10-25 19:22:43	@PikFan	did he get dislodged from the KHA Lander and fall into the tree, or something?
2015-10-25 19:23:03	ScruffyChat	I think he got dislodged and fell into the lake, and swam his way to the island
2015-10-25 19:23:40	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 19:24:20	En_Passant	It doesn't have to be looking for Edward
2015-10-25 19:24:42	En_Passant	It could just see a giant, fruit-bearing tree on a protected island and think it's a good place to build a colony
2015-10-25 19:24:52	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-25 19:25:00	ScruffyChat	Oh, excellent
2015-10-25 19:25:04	ScruffyChat	right right sorry
2015-10-25 19:25:10	ScruffyChat	It comes before Edward
2015-10-25 19:25:40	ScruffyChat	Actually that's a good idea
2015-10-25 19:25:43	ScruffyChat	A great idea
2015-10-25 19:25:53	ScruffyChat	But why would it be hostile to Olimar and co
2015-10-25 19:26:40	En_Passant	Maybe they initiate the fight?
2015-10-25 19:27:19	En_Passant	(It coming before Edward was just a suggestion - sending a robot to find him first is perfectly workable as well)
2015-10-25 19:27:27	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-25 19:27:56	ScruffyChat	Well, if the robot were designed for an unexpected rescue mission, it would be built hastily
2015-10-25 19:28:02	ScruffyChat	So it wouldn't have to be as intelligent
2015-10-25 19:28:15	ScruffyChat	As if it were beginning a colonizing mission
2015-10-25 19:28:28	ScruffyChat	But, having it try to build a colony on the island sounds really cool
2015-10-25 19:28:49	ScruffyChat	Like, you'd get there and find all these half-finished structures and foreshadowing
2015-10-25 19:30:12	ScruffyChat	And it trying to level the land by removing the tree
2015-10-25 19:30:17	@PikFan	uh
2015-10-25 19:30:29	@PikFan	why would it want to build a colony on the island?
2015-10-25 19:30:51	ScruffyChat	It's near fresh water and fruti
2015-10-25 19:30:54	ScruffyChat	fruit
2015-10-25 19:31:02	ScruffyChat	Actually it wouldn't remove the tree then
2015-10-25 19:31:08	ScruffyChat	Just encroach upon it
2015-10-25 19:31:10	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-10-25 19:31:55	@PikFan	but where would Hocotatians get their food, then? assuming that Hocotatians usually eat only vegetables
2015-10-25 19:32:05	En_Passant	Pretty sure that's a stereotype
2015-10-25 19:32:06	@PikFan	(usually because Louie)
2015-10-25 19:32:41	En_Passant	Louie did steal the Koppaites' _fruit_ juice, after all
2015-10-25 19:32:54	@PikFan	12:32	PikFan	(usually because Louie)
2015-10-25 19:33:00	En_Passant	... that's a really poor system for underlining)
2015-10-25 19:33:18	ScruffyChat	It's like a little bridge under the word
2015-10-25 19:33:18	En_Passant	Oh, I see what you mean now
2015-10-25 19:33:37	@PikFan	Louie is presumably an exception
2015-10-25 19:33:48	@PikFan	keyword: presumably
2015-10-25 19:34:07	ScruffyChat	Well I doubt everyone on Hocotate is treasure-crazed
2015-10-25 19:34:13	ScruffyChat	Olimar certainly isn't
2015-10-25 19:34:20	ScruffyChat	At least, for the first two games
2015-10-25 19:34:29	@PikFan	based on what we've seen, I think it's fair to say that most Hocotatians eat only vegetables
2015-10-25 19:34:40	@PikFan	but I digress, this is getting away from the point
2015-10-25 19:34:44	En_Passant	We've seen a grand total of three Hocotatians in person
2015-10-25 19:37:23	ScruffyChat	I'm really excited about this drone idea
2015-10-25 19:37:43	ScruffyChat	I think it should come after Edward though
2015-10-25 19:37:59	ScruffyChat	Because that means it also comes after DELTA, who is a very intelligent robot
2015-10-25 19:38:19	@PikFan	oh, you mean when the President and his two robots start exploring?
2015-10-25 19:38:30	@PikFan	as a way to continue the story?
2015-10-25 19:38:52	En_Passant	No, the unmanned robot sent to the planet
2015-10-25 19:40:13	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-25 19:40:24	ScruffyChat	The unmanned robot comes after the manned mission
2015-10-25 19:40:29	ScruffyChat	As an initial rescue
2015-10-25 19:40:39	ScruffyChat	And when they hear nothing, they send Olimar
2015-10-25 19:41:03	ScruffyChat	Well, actually, that doesn't make sense
2015-10-25 19:41:21	@PikFan	don't you mean the unmanned robot comes BEFORE the manned mission?
2015-10-25 19:41:34	En_Passant	no
2015-10-25 19:41:43	@PikFan	...???
2015-10-25 19:41:43	En_Passant	Edward and DELTA go to colonize
2015-10-25 19:41:52	@PikFan	OH
2015-10-25 19:41:54	En_Passant	They go MIA
2015-10-25 19:42:01	En_Passant	Robot goes to rescue them and also goes MIA
2015-10-25 19:42:05	@PikFan	no, I understant now
2015-10-25 19:42:09	@PikFan	*understand
2015-10-25 19:42:32	@PikFan	when he said "manned mission" I thought he meant the manned *rescue* mission
2015-10-25 19:42:35	@PikFan	derp
2015-10-25 19:42:44	ScruffyChat	And Olimar's like Now I have to go all the way over there to rescue all you guys
2015-10-25 19:42:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 19:43:04	ScruffyChat	And Olimar crash-lands
2015-10-25 19:43:26	ScruffyChat	It's a dangerous planet
2015-10-25 19:44:49	@PikFan	indeed
2015-10-25 19:46:33	ScruffyChat	But there's sort of a theme of technological vs human efforts
2015-10-25 19:46:36	ScruffyChat	Which I love
2015-10-25 19:46:48	ScruffyChat	The KHA thinks they can get everything done with robots
2015-10-25 19:47:16	ScruffyChat	But their rescue robot goes haywire, and it takes their veteran pilot to straighten things out
2015-10-25 19:49:20	En_Passant	Question: Why did Edward and DELTA crash?
2015-10-25 19:49:39	@PikFan	they crashed into the Onions protecting the tree
2015-10-25 19:50:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 19:50:15	ScruffyChat	I mean, it's a stretch
2015-10-25 19:50:27	ScruffyChat	I was never 100% on that part
2015-10-25 19:50:46	ScruffyChat	Both the KHA lander and Olimar crash for the same reason
2015-10-25 19:51:09	ScruffyChat	Meaning they reach the earth at a similar Earth time, in a similar trajectory
2015-10-25 19:52:56	ScruffyChat	It COULD happen, but it's a stretch
2015-10-25 19:53:06	ScruffyChat	But it would also mean they're on the same page at the end of the game
2015-10-25 19:53:43	En_Passant	If they hit the same obstacle, shouldn't they land near each other?
2015-10-25 19:54:07	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-25 19:54:14	ScruffyChat	Although
2015-10-25 19:54:34	ScruffyChat	Olimar is just following the signal of Edward and DELTA
2015-10-25 19:54:41	ScruffyChat	He could approach it from any angle
2015-10-25 19:55:04	ScruffyChat	In the prologue film I have him descend at a near tangent to Earth
2015-10-25 19:55:14	@PikFan	20:47:06: <ScruffyM> I mean, maybe the Pikmin tree is in the Glade of Daylight, but Olimar doesn't know Edward is there until he has the Kha lander back
2015-10-25 19:55:15	ScruffyChat	Instead of straight down like the previous games
2015-10-25 19:55:38	ScruffyChat	Olimar's ship is destroyed
2015-10-25 19:55:56	ScruffyChat	It would have carried Edward's and DELTA's signal
2015-10-25 19:56:00	@PikFan	that would fit in with what you were saying about how they land close to each other
2015-10-25 19:56:17	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-25 19:56:45	ScruffyChat	But there'd be no point in sending Olimar on a rescue mission if he didn't know at least what general area to land in
2015-10-25 19:57:24	@PikFan	well
2015-10-25 19:57:46	@PikFan	let's say that he does know the general location of Edward
2015-10-25 19:57:53	@PikFan	but he sees the Onions in the way
2015-10-25 19:58:02	@PikFan	as such, he has to recalculate his landing sequence
2015-10-25 19:58:17	@PikFan	...and now this is inconsistent with your prologue movie
2015-10-25 19:58:17	En_Passant	Oh yeah, the intro says he tries to avoid them
2015-10-25 19:58:52	ScruffyChat	He's already in the cloud when he tries to avoid them
2015-10-25 19:59:02	ScruffyChat	By "avoid" I mean he takes evasive action
2015-10-25 19:59:13	ScruffyChat	Okay, so
2015-10-25 19:59:19	@PikFan	cloud of Onions? or just a regular cloud
2015-10-25 19:59:25	ScruffyChat	The Onion cloud is also in a regular cloud
2015-10-25 19:59:32	@PikFan	complex
2015-10-25 19:59:36	ScruffyChat	It doesn't have to be all the time
2015-10-25 19:59:44	ScruffyChat	But Olimar descends through a cloud
2015-10-25 19:59:53	ScruffyChat	And starts noticing Onions surrounding him
2015-10-25 20:00:32	ScruffyChat	And suddenly he's surrounded, and has to maneuver the ship manually
2015-10-25 20:00:51	ScruffyChat	But he collides with one
2015-10-25 20:01:29	@PikFan	oh hmm
2015-10-25 20:01:32	ScruffyChat	It doesn't have to be this way; I could rewrite the movie
2015-10-25 20:01:39	ScruffyChat	I don't mind
2015-10-25 20:01:45	ScruffyChat	As long as you guys don't
2015-10-25 20:01:52	@PikFan	are you sure? you've already put a ton of effort into it...
2015-10-25 20:02:22	ScruffyChat	I mean, I have, but my computer can only make it look so good
2015-10-25 20:02:33	ScruffyChat	Plus I've learned more stuff since rendering that part
2015-10-25 20:02:44	ScruffyChat	I was already thinking of redoing some scenes
2015-10-25 20:03:00	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 20:03:02	ScruffyChat	But it still depends on whether this scenario works or not
2015-10-25 20:03:10	@PikFan	well, okay
2015-10-25 20:03:30	@PikFan	Olimar is probably going to come in from a different angle than Edward and the robot
2015-10-25 20:03:48	@PikFan	and when he collides, he's likely going to be sent in some other direction
2015-10-25 20:04:01	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-25 20:04:25	@PikFan	so... that works
2015-10-25 20:04:37	ScruffyChat	Yes, I suppose so
2015-10-25 20:05:00	ScruffyChat	There's plenty of room between the cloud and the ground
2015-10-25 20:05:06	ScruffyChat	That's one thing about P3
2015-10-25 20:05:23	ScruffyChat	How could the Drake suffer a malfunction that doesn't even damage it
2015-10-25 20:05:38	ScruffyChat	And send the three crewmembers off to different continents?
2015-10-25 20:06:15	En_Passant	The whole continent thing was dumb imo
2015-10-25 20:06:57	@PikFan	Alph says that the Drake initiated its autopilot when it neared the surface so it could land safely
2015-10-25 20:07:09	@PikFan	or something like that
2015-10-25 20:07:32	@PikFan	but we never got an explanation as to why the leaders were scattered across the planet
2015-10-25 20:08:25	En_Passant	Well, they were probably ejected from high up
2015-10-25 20:08:42	@PikFan	right
2015-10-25 20:08:43	En_Passant	The high entry velocity could carry them, though not nearly that far
2015-10-25 20:08:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 20:09:01	@PikFan	yay for Nintendo logic
2015-10-25 20:09:26	ScruffyChat	Something went more "horribly wrong" than we thought
2015-10-25 20:10:14	ScruffyChat	Well, just to recap
2015-10-25 20:10:34	ScruffyChat	Edward/DELTA come first looking to colonize, and crash with the Onions
2015-10-25 20:10:54	ScruffyChat	KHA sends this unmanned drone quickly to rescue them
2015-10-25 20:10:58	ScruffyChat	It goes MIA
2015-10-25 20:11:08	ScruffyChat	So they send Olimar
2015-10-25 20:11:25	ScruffyChat	And he also crashes with the Onions, but at a different angle
2015-10-25 20:11:33	ScruffyChat	Perhaps due to the rotation of earth
2015-10-25 20:11:46	ScruffyChat	in the film, I happened to have him collide in the morning
2015-10-25 20:11:58	ScruffyChat	So that, when he collides, it could be the middle of the day
2015-10-25 20:12:08	ScruffyChat	(And perpetually stay that way for the first day)
2015-10-25 20:12:54	ScruffyChat	At the end, Olimar, DELTA, and Loucap find the KHA Lander and use it to locate Edward
2015-10-25 20:13:00	@PikFan	yeah, I was thinking that the different angle was caused by the rotation
2015-10-25 20:13:15	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-10-25 20:13:26	ScruffyChat	On an island containing the Pikmin tree
2015-10-25 20:13:42	@PikFan	because the KHA Lander can actually pick up signals, as opposed to the dilapidated Research Pod
2015-10-25 20:13:49	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-10-25 20:14:26	ScruffyChat	Perhaps, when they get to the island
2015-10-25 20:14:38	ScruffyChat	the drone has already picked up Edward (forcibly?)
2015-10-25 20:14:54	ScruffyChat	And has gone on a new directive of continuing the colonization mission
2015-10-25 20:15:18	ScruffyChat	which means it is messing up this island from which Onions come
2015-10-25 20:15:37	ScruffyChat	And shows Olimar that interfering with the planet is a bad idea
2015-10-25 20:16:11	ScruffyChat	(And in the epilogue, the President doesn't care, allowing you to play as him in his own manned mission to PNF-404)
2015-10-25 20:17:07	ScruffyChat	I like it, any thoughts?
2015-10-25 20:17:41	En_Passant	Not a fan of the epilogue because it loses the closure
2015-10-25 20:17:47	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-25 20:17:59	En_Passant	Not really an end to the series if there's still active involvement
2015-10-25 20:18:07	ScruffyChat	PikFan had just mentioned to me before that having more game after the game is cool
2015-10-25 20:18:14	ScruffyChat	I suppose
2015-10-25 20:18:27	En_Passant	Well, there's always side modes
2015-10-25 20:18:32	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-25 20:18:40	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna have a huge Challenge Mode
2015-10-25 20:18:58	ScruffyChat	And basically a Super Pikmin Maker
2015-10-25 20:19:16	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 20:19:31	@PikFan	I don't like the idea that you can't play anymore after you beat the final boss
2015-10-25 20:19:40	@PikFan	I mean, I can understand the closure bit
2015-10-25 20:19:57	@PikFan	but I still feel like you should be able to play after the final boss
2015-10-25 20:20:08	@PikFan	that's what I liked about P2
2015-10-25 20:20:20	@PikFan	I mean, really it depends on the game
2015-10-25 20:20:37	En_Passant	P1 beating the game required you to get everything
2015-10-25 20:20:51	@PikFan	or almost everything
2015-10-25 20:21:09	ScruffyChat	Maybe Piklopedia entries carry over per game
2015-10-25 20:21:24	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 20:21:25	@PikFan	OH
2015-10-25 20:21:27	@PikFan	what if
2015-10-25 20:21:38	En_Passant	You can start a New Game +?
2015-10-25 20:21:49	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2015-10-25 20:21:50	@PikFan	ok so, what if it says "Pikmin 3 save data detected!" and that unlocks something
2015-10-25 20:21:59	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2015-10-25 20:22:01	ScruffyChat	But what?
2015-10-25 20:22:11	ScruffyChat	And I like New Game + as wel
2015-10-25 20:22:23	ScruffyChat	well*
2015-10-25 20:22:25	@PikFan	I do too
2015-10-25 20:23:23	@PikFan	I've been looking into this and other common tropes http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss
2015-10-25 20:23:41	@PikFan	I'm thinking that the TFB of PCW would be the Arachlord
2015-10-25 20:23:57	@PikFan	perhaps as the boss of the Chasm of Challenges?
2015-10-25 20:24:10	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-10-25 20:24:39	ScruffyChat	The Chasm of Challenges often starts to sound like the end-all Pikmin challenge
2015-10-25 20:24:49	ScruffyChat	I really like where it's going
2015-10-25 20:24:51	@PikFan	that's what it's meant to be
2015-10-25 20:25:06	@PikFan	it's both a sprint and a marathon
2015-10-25 20:25:50	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-25 20:26:02	@PikFan	well, maybe not even a cave
2015-10-25 20:26:15	@PikFan	because I'd be introducing a time limit to all the other caves
2015-10-25 20:26:22	@PikFan	and it wouldn't really work here
2015-10-25 20:26:30	@PikFan	so... maybe Challenger's Realm?
2015-10-25 20:27:11	ScruffyChat	Well, do you not want a time limit on this either?
2015-10-25 20:27:29	@PikFan	no, I don't want a time limit on this, because of how long it is
2015-10-25 20:28:09	@PikFan	so going back to my idea about the Universal Equilibrium and collecting the 8 planets
2015-10-25 20:28:18	@PikFan	doing that would cause a portal to open
2015-10-25 20:28:32	@PikFan	and entering this portal would transport you to the Challenger's Realm
2015-10-25 20:28:43	@PikFan	no time limit, but you have to complete 100 challenges
2015-10-25 20:29:05	ScruffyChat	So, the Challenger's Realm is somewhere else in space
2015-10-25 20:29:08	@PikFan	right
2015-10-25 20:29:20	ScruffyChat	It can be a cave or an area then
2015-10-25 20:29:29	@PikFan	possibly
2015-10-25 20:29:33	ScruffyChat	It doesn't matter, if the space is radically different
2015-10-25 20:29:43	@PikFan	but I'm thinking it would have an ethereal like appearance
2015-10-25 20:29:58	@PikFan	stars and other celestial objects in the background
2015-10-25 20:30:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-25 20:30:15	@PikFan	and maybe it could be all seamless
2015-10-25 20:30:29	ScruffyChat	Ooh, that's one big area
2015-10-25 20:30:34	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-25 20:33:28	--	Pidgey is now known as SLPidgey
2015-10-25 20:38:11	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2015-10-25 20:38:27	ScruffyChat	Thank you guys both, and NVortex and Jpmrocks and everyone else, for helping me so much with this game
2015-10-25 20:38:36	ScruffyChat	I feel better about this plot
2015-10-25 20:38:41	ScruffyChat	I like the themes more
2015-10-25 20:38:50	ScruffyChat	And it all makes physical sense, which is a plus
2015-10-25 20:39:06	@PikFan	no problem
2015-10-25 20:39:16	ScruffyChat	And I'm excited to getting into revising the story and fleshing out the new parts
2015-10-25 20:39:18	@PikFan	they helped too?
2015-10-25 20:39:28	ScruffyChat	I think so
2015-10-25 20:39:29	En_Passant	Probably in the Pikipedia Skype grout
2015-10-25 20:39:31	En_Passant	*group
2015-10-25 20:39:33	@PikFan	I know Nvortex did, but I didn't know—oh
2015-10-25 20:39:37	En_Passant	Which I'm still not invited to
2015-10-25 20:39:39	ScruffyChat	I don't use Skype
2015-10-25 20:39:43	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 20:39:45	ScruffyChat	I have it, I just forget
2015-10-25 20:39:53	@PikFan	En_Passant, you'd better bug Espyo then
2015-10-25 20:40:12	@Espyo	huh
2015-10-25 20:42:32	ScruffyChat	We solved this just in time, I've gotta get goin
2015-10-25 20:42:37	ScruffyChat	Thanks again guys
2015-10-25 20:42:52	ScruffyChat	Might be on later
2015-10-25 20:43:09	ScruffyChat	Bye
2015-10-25 20:43:14	<--	ScruffyChat (Mibbit@207.98.otz.su) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-10-25 20:58:21	En_Passant	Speaking of important plot points, I feel like I'm not getting across what I want to about what's happening on PNF-404
2015-10-25 20:58:38	@PikFan	for Pikmin V?
2015-10-25 20:58:41	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-10-25 20:59:40	En_Passant	I'm trying to connect the strange relationship forming between nature, machines, and the unnatural element
2015-10-25 20:59:54	@PikFan	the goop?
2015-10-25 21:00:21	En_Passant	The goop (which is actually another Wraith) is the unnatural element of it
2015-10-25 21:00:30	@PikFan	Ooh
2015-10-25 21:01:10	En_Passant	I want the "radioactivity" to be the source of both those and the creature-metal fusions like the Groink
2015-10-25 21:01:43	En_Passant	And of the crash landings
2015-10-25 21:03:40	@PikFan	right
2015-10-25 21:05:23	En_Passant	I feel like the connection is somewhat forced because it doesn't really show up at all until the fake ending
2015-10-25 21:06:23	@PikFan	fake ending?
2015-10-25 21:07:29	En_Passant	After getting Louie and the hydraulics system
2015-10-25 21:07:54	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-25 21:07:56	En_Passant	They have what they came for and have visited all areas, so it's supposed to look like they're leaving
2015-10-25 21:08:08	En_Passant	And then surprise, the goop is important
2015-10-25 21:08:14	@PikFan	and then the goop suddenly strikes—yeah
2015-10-25 21:08:48	En_Passant	The final boss will be a Wraith that uses metal objects as defense
2015-10-25 21:09:22	@PikFan	interesting
2015-10-25 21:10:46	En_Passant	The connection between the goop, the crash-landings (because it forms on metal objects), and the disturbances is okay, I feel
2015-10-25 21:10:59	En_Passant	But I'm not sure how to include what's happening to the world
2015-10-25 21:11:29	En_Passant	(I just remembered that I also want it to be connected to the drastic environmental change)
2015-10-25 21:12:06	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2015-10-25 21:14:54	En_Passant	Am I being confusing with this? I'm trying to gather my thoughts about everything that I want to define about it
2015-10-25 21:18:43	@PikFan	a bit
2015-10-25 21:18:54	@PikFan	I understand everything except for the global change part
2015-10-25 21:19:05	@PikFan	like, what is it about the world that's changing
2015-10-25 21:19:07	@PikFan	?
2015-10-25 21:23:42	En_Passant	You know how the areas changed drastically between P1 and P2?
2015-10-25 21:24:22	@PikFan	yeah?
2015-10-25 21:24:32	En_Passant	That sort of thing
2015-10-25 21:26:08	En_Passant	That will be demonstrated once the strange storm hits, as the region will be quite different
2015-10-25 21:26:35	En_Passant	I'd still like to get it more involved with the plot, though
2015-10-25 21:26:52	En_Passant	Kinda like how P3 led into the search for Olimar
2015-10-25 21:28:10	@PikFan	maybe have more of that during the game
2015-10-25 21:28:30	@PikFan	more regional changing ingame, that is
2015-10-25 21:28:59	@PikFan	but then the strange storm makes things REALLY different
2015-10-25 21:37:44	@PikFan	hey, Espyo
2015-10-25 21:38:04	@PikFan	I've noticed that you've been uploading a lot of menu images lately
2015-10-25 21:38:17	@PikFan	I already uploaded similar ones back in July

2015-10-26 21:18:16	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-26 21:18:26	Nvortex	hi
2015-10-26 21:20:24	@Espyo	hi
2015-10-26 21:20:31	@Espyo	so I'm making maps for P3 using the textures
2015-10-26 21:20:37	@PikFan	that Distant Spring TAS looks neat
2015-10-26 21:20:41	@PikFan	oh, nice
2015-10-26 21:20:43	@Espyo	and I want to make them more compact than the usual radar map
2015-10-26 21:20:50	@Espyo	so that they fit better inside navboxes and don't have as much unused space
2015-10-26 21:20:57	@PikFan	what do you mean?
2015-10-26 21:21:02	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/f2/Tropical_Wilds_Map.png
2015-10-26 21:21:06	@Espyo	you have the main area
2015-10-26 21:21:14	@Espyo	and then the other bits of the land are scattered about
2015-10-26 21:21:17	@Espyo	so much empty space in-between
2015-10-26 21:21:33	@Espyo	if you put that in a navbox (like we have {{The Distant Spring}}, for instance), it'll look horribly tiny
2015-10-26 21:21:33	Testyo	"The_Distant_Spring" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:The_Distant_Spring
2015-10-26 21:21:35	@PikFan	oh, so you want to cut out as much space as possible
2015-10-26 21:21:38	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-26 21:21:41	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-26 21:21:47	@Espyo	but I have no good way of indicating that this point links to that point
2015-10-26 21:21:49	@Espyo	I tried lines but...
2015-10-26 21:21:53	@Espyo	bleeeeeehhhhhhhhhh...
2015-10-26 21:22:07	@PikFan	I can agree with that, but at the same time, you're not showing the "true" map
2015-10-26 21:22:38	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Tropical%20Wilds.png
2015-10-26 21:22:41	@Espyo	yeah, that's a concern I have too
2015-10-26 21:22:45	@Espyo	hm
2015-10-26 21:22:50	@Espyo	I could always make a navbox-only version
2015-10-26 21:23:03	@Espyo	the navbox is more for navigation purposes (duh)
2015-10-26 21:23:07	@Espyo	so its goal is to just have the stuff you click on
2015-10-26 21:23:14	@Espyo	the "real" map could use the right proportions
2015-10-26 21:23:39	@PikFan	it looks okay
2015-10-26 21:23:55	@Espyo	some lines look awkward
2015-10-26 21:23:59	@Espyo	like on the top-right
2015-10-26 21:24:03	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-26 21:24:10	@Espyo	and the one crossing through everything just to point to the path that Alph takes on day 1
2015-10-26 21:24:20	@Espyo	well, the "real" map won't really need these lines... I hope
2015-10-26 21:24:35	@PikFan	the one leading to the cave with the Flighty Joustmites looks odd, too
2015-10-26 21:24:40	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-26 21:24:57	@PikFan	anyway, so these are in-game textures?
2015-10-26 21:25:08	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-26 21:25:12	@Espyo	each part is its own texture
2015-10-26 21:25:17	@Espyo	so I had to rotate them and place them manually
2015-10-26 21:25:18	@PikFan	the maps I wanted to make but never did (ugh) wouldn't be as clean as this
2015-10-26 21:25:19	@Espyo	kinda sucks
2015-10-26 21:25:20	@PikFan	right
2015-10-26 21:25:30	@PikFan	they'd have all the obstacles and such
2015-10-26 21:25:53	@Espyo	well yeah
2015-10-26 21:26:06	@PikFan	and then you'll just place icons of fruit on them where they'd appear, like the other navboxes?
2015-10-26 21:26:23	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-26 21:26:27	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-26 21:26:45	@PikFan	Tropical Wilds is the only one I'm worried about
2015-10-26 21:26:48	@PikFan	it's so...
2015-10-26 21:26:49	@PikFan	wide
2015-10-26 21:27:23	@Espyo	I can remove the path leading to the boss
2015-10-26 21:27:25	@Espyo	we won't place any icon there
2015-10-26 21:27:35	@Espyo	again, the navbox is just there to have icons slapped on top of it
2015-10-26 21:27:43	@PikFan	hm
2015-10-26 21:27:59	@PikFan	maybe...

2015-10-26 21:28:47	@PikFan	I'm not sure if I like that
2015-10-26 21:29:09	@PikFan	ideally we'd want to show the "real" map, free of any modifications
2015-10-26 21:29:11	@PikFan	but...
2015-10-26 21:29:17	@PikFan	it's so wide
2015-10-26 21:29:22	@Espyo	this will just be for the navbox
2015-10-26 21:29:24	@Espyo	I can feel it
2015-10-26 21:29:31	@PikFan	no, I know
2015-10-26 21:29:40	@PikFan	even so
2015-10-26 21:30:01	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Tropical%20Wilds%20navbox.png dunno, I can imagine this splattered with icons
2015-10-26 21:30:43	@PikFan	guh, fine
2015-10-26 21:31:17	@Espyo	there's no other way
2015-10-26 21:31:30	@Espyo	I tried shrinking the "real" map to the same size it'd be on the navbox
2015-10-26 21:31:32	@Espyo	and you can't make anything out
2015-10-26 21:31:48	@PikFan	how big would the navbox be?
2015-10-26 21:32:04	@Espyo	about the size of the other ones
2015-10-26 21:32:11	@Espyo	uh, don't know by heart, but like 200 pixels tall?

2015-10-26 21:34:14	@Espyo	specially people needing guides
2015-10-26 21:34:23	@PikFan	I see
2015-10-26 21:34:27	@Espyo	I can easily imagine somebody playing and having a mobile device with a walkthrough page on the side
2015-10-26 21:34:46	@PikFan	why does mobile have to be so... small
2015-10-26 21:34:58	@PikFan	oh well
2015-10-26 21:35:07	@Espyo	that's why it's mobile |:

2015-10-26 21:38:02	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-26 21:38:03	En_Passant	hey guys
2015-10-26 21:38:11	En_Passant	Any discussions going on?
2015-10-26 21:38:16	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-26 21:38:28	@PikFan	Espyo's figuring out how to scale P3 maps for the navboxes
2015-10-26 21:38:50	@Espyo	bleh, what does the Calcified Crushblat have?
2015-10-26 21:38:58	@PikFan	Searing Acidshock
2015-10-26 21:39:00	En_Passant	Searing Acidshock iirc
2015-10-26 21:39:10	@Espyo	Sea-- yeah
2015-10-26 21:39:33	ScruffyChat	Hi everyone
2015-10-26 21:39:50	En_Passant	hi
2015-10-26 21:39:59	@PikFan	one time when I was playing P3 I skipped all the fruits in the Tropical Wilds, then after I rescued Louie I went back and got all 18 at once
2015-10-26 21:40:02	@PikFan	it was awesome
2015-10-26 21:40:05	@PikFan	and hi ScruffyChat
2015-10-26 21:40:25	ScruffyChat	Hi, and woah
2015-10-26 21:40:40	ScruffyChat	Do the icons for fruit get smaller or do they just take up two lines?
2015-10-26 21:40:47	ScruffyChat	I never got enough in one day to tell
2015-10-26 21:41:01	En_Passant	I think they take two lines
2015-10-26 21:41:19	@PikFan	you mean for the end of day?
2015-10-26 21:41:32	@PikFan	they can take up to four lines, I think
2015-10-26 21:41:35	@Espyo	heh
2015-10-26 21:41:41	ScruffyChat	I mean during the day, as the S.S. Drake keeps saying "New Fruit Recovered"
2015-10-26 21:41:45	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-26 21:41:53	ScruffyChat	But four lines at the end!
2015-10-26 21:41:58	ScruffyChat	That's pretty crazy
2015-10-26 21:42:21	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Sandbox
2015-10-26 21:42:22	@PikFan	when it shows the fruit collected over the course of the day, I mean
2015-10-26 21:42:42	@PikFan	2 or more lines if they're collected quickly
2015-10-26 21:43:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-26 21:43:15	ScruffyChat	That's a cool map
2015-10-26 21:43:22	@Espyo	placeholder
2015-10-26 21:43:25	@Espyo	we got it off of Prima
2015-10-26 21:43:29	@Espyo	unless you mean the second one
2015-10-26 21:43:31	@PikFan	that's not that bad
2015-10-26 21:43:39	@Espyo	anyway, I think it could stand to be a bit smaller...
2015-10-26 21:43:40	En_Passant	I'm worried about the size
2015-10-26 21:43:43	@Espyo	well, I am using this placeholder one
2015-10-26 21:43:47	En_Passant	I think it's too small
2015-10-26 21:43:52	@Espyo	yeah, the size-- WHAT?!
2015-10-26 21:43:56	@Espyo	SMALL?
2015-10-26 21:43:58	@Espyo	it's huge!
2015-10-26 21:44:03	En_Passant	The first one
2015-10-26 21:44:08	@PikFan	I'm laughing
2015-10-26 21:44:09	@Espyo	yeah, that one's huge
2015-10-26 21:44:19	@Espyo	it's meant to be a navbox at the end of TW-related articles
2015-10-26 21:44:26	En_Passant	You're not going to be able to tell where everything is
2015-10-26 21:44:29	@Espyo	its current size is pretty much the max we can go without going nuts
2015-10-26 21:44:35	@Espyo	that map sucks in terms of contrast
2015-10-26 21:44:36	@PikFan	Espyo, you
2015-10-26 21:44:39	@Espyo	it's really packed with detail
2015-10-26 21:44:42	@PikFan	*you're already nuts
2015-10-26 21:44:45	@Espyo	nope
2015-10-26 21:44:54	@PikFan	sure you are
2015-10-26 21:44:55	En_Passant	It'll be a cluster of overlapping images that will cause frustration
2015-10-26 21:45:06	@Espyo	hm
2015-10-26 21:45:13	@Espyo	En_Passant: what do you think of this one then? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:The_Impact_Site
2015-10-26 21:45:15	@PikFan	actually, show him the image with the cyan lines
2015-10-26 21:45:19	@Espyo	not sounding condescending, I'm actually asking
2015-10-26 21:45:30	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Tropical%20Wilds.png (cyan lines)
2015-10-26 21:45:45	@Espyo	here's what we'll do: since I have to make a "full"-sized map anyway
2015-10-26 21:45:50	@Espyo	I'll make it and try to slap that on a navbox
2015-10-26 21:45:56	@Espyo	and we can see if we feel a "final" draft
2015-10-26 21:46:03	@Espyo	instead of this "kinda bad size, kinda bad contrast" image
2015-10-26 21:46:28	@PikFan	it could be taller if it wasn't so wide
2015-10-26 21:46:40	@Espyo	taller would probably be even worse
2015-10-26 21:46:46	@PikFan	I can't understand why the Prima guide has so much empty space at the sides
2015-10-26 21:46:47	@Espyo	you'd have to scroll so much just to see it all
2015-10-26 21:46:51	@Espyo	and scroll so much just to get away from it
2015-10-26 21:46:54	ScruffyChat	You could rotate the whole picture
2015-10-26 21:47:05	ScruffyChat	Oh, wait, taller is worse, nevermidn
2015-10-26 21:47:09	ScruffyChat	mind*
2015-10-26 21:47:13	@Espyo	I think I rotated uh...
2015-10-26 21:47:17	@Espyo	{{The Forest Navel}}
2015-10-26 21:47:18	Testyo	"The_Forest_Navel" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:The_Forest_Navel
2015-10-26 21:47:19	@Espyo	that one ^
2015-10-26 21:47:35	@PikFan	like, that's how it should be
2015-10-26 21:47:38	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the orientation doesn't matter
2015-10-26 21:47:40	@PikFan	no space on the edges
2015-10-26 21:47:56	@PikFan	but the Prima guide image is like "lolnope, we're going to waste lots of space"
2015-10-26 21:49:20	ScruffyChat	I think I prefer the one with cyan lines to the Prima image
2015-10-26 21:49:31	@PikFan	same
2015-10-26 21:50:11	ScruffyChat	And I for one am ok with the lines themselves, I like the Bezier shape
2015-10-26 21:51:26	@Espyo	I don't know, I feel like this should be an all-or-nothing
2015-10-26 21:51:32	@Espyo	we're going out of our way to create clean maps
2015-10-26 21:51:36	@Espyo	and then soiling them with our lines
2015-10-26 21:52:32	ScruffyChat	I suppose I'm fine without them
2015-10-26 21:52:48	ScruffyChat	Anyone who has played the area knows most of the connections already
2015-10-26 21:52:57	ScruffyChat	And they're pretty understandable
2015-10-26 21:53:05	ScruffyChat	Except for a few
2015-10-26 21:54:27	@Espyo	yeah, but at the same time, the maps are there to help new players, kinda
2015-10-26 21:54:33	@Espyo	so without the lines, they become a bit useless
2015-10-26 21:54:40	@Espyo	although...
2015-10-26 21:54:44	@Espyo	there is a project
2015-10-26 21:54:50	@Espyo	to create detailed maps
2015-10-26 21:54:59	@Espyo	heck, that's what the second, big map on the Sandbox is meant to be
2015-10-26 21:55:08	@Espyo	so we can just add the lines there
2015-10-26 21:58:45	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think I'm doing this today
2015-10-26 21:58:53	@Espyo	told GIMP to resize an image
2015-10-26 21:59:01	@Espyo	apparently, to windows, that's harder than giving birth
2015-10-26 21:59:13	@Espyo	oh, it's my RAM
2015-10-26 21:59:22	@Espyo	...it's not THAT big, c'mon
2015-10-26 22:06:44	ScruffyChat	Gotta go
2015-10-26 22:06:52	ScruffyChat	I might be here later
2015-10-26 22:06:53	ScruffyChat	Bye!

2015-10-26 23:27:54	ScruffyChat	Back
2015-10-26 23:41:40	En_Passant	Scruffy, now I need my own help figuring out my game's plot
2015-10-26 23:44:16	ScruffyChat	Sure, no problem!
2015-10-26 23:44:22	ScruffyChat	How so?
2015-10-26 23:44:43	En_Passant	I feel like I'm doing an inadequate job conveying what I want to about PNF-404
2015-10-26 23:45:35	En_Passant	So there are going to be these "disturbances" which basically cause all of the strange behavior we've seen
2015-10-26 23:47:06	En_Passant	The disturbances cause the wraith goop to form on metal objects, which they are attracted to while sentient
2015-10-26 23:47:58	En_Passant	It'll also be connected to the strange fusions between organic life and artificial creations
2015-10-26 23:48:36	En_Passant	As well as the drastic environmental changes we've seen in P2
2015-10-26 23:49:48	ScruffyChat	Okay, so these "disturbances" cause all these consequences. What causes the "disturbances?"
2015-10-26 23:50:15	En_Passant	I don't plan on revealing that, mostly because I'm unsure of it myself
2015-10-26 23:50:44	En_Passant	That was poorly worded. I don't plan on revealing it, and I don't really know myself
2015-10-26 23:50:53	En_Passant	Something humans did
2015-10-26 23:50:57	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-26 23:51:33	ScruffyChat	Do you plan on explaining what the wraith goop is? I noticed in your story it seemed like you were building up to something with it
2015-10-26 23:51:45	ScruffyChat	I feel like that could easily be something human
2015-10-26 23:52:03	En_Passant	The final boss will be another wraith, which has collected metal objects
2015-10-26 23:52:15	<--	Espyo (Espyo@s58-396-04-193.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-10-26 23:52:23	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-26 23:52:40	ScruffyChat	Does it use the metal objects to harm you? Or does it just collect them to collect them
2015-10-26 23:52:48	En_Passant	It will use them to defend itself, yes
2015-10-26 23:52:52	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-26 23:52:54	ScruffyChat	Neat
2015-10-26 23:52:58	ScruffyChat	Well
2015-10-26 23:53:09	<--	Testyo (Testyo@s58-396-04-193.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-10-26 23:53:11	ScruffyChat	I wouldn't say there's an organism yet that specifically seeks out metal
2015-10-26 23:53:14	ScruffyChat	Besides humans
2015-10-26 23:53:40	En_Passant	And that's okay
2015-10-26 23:53:41	ScruffyChat	Does it want the Drake as well, I'm assuming?
2015-10-26 23:53:51	En_Passant	It's the strange sentient goop that's attracted to it
2015-10-26 23:53:52	En_Passant	Yes
2015-10-26 23:54:08	En_Passant	I'm citing these disturbances as the source of all of the crash landings
2015-10-26 23:54:17	ScruffyChat	That's good
2015-10-26 23:54:39	ScruffyChat	Because Pikmin 3 just teased us with ti
2015-10-26 23:54:41	ScruffyChat	it*
2015-10-26 23:55:12	ScruffyChat	Well, in what way do you feel you are misrepresenting PNF-404?
2015-10-26 23:55:23	ScruffyChat	That is isn't natural enough?
2015-10-26 23:55:29	ScruffyChat	it* isn't
2015-10-26 23:55:40	En_Passant	Most of this connection doesn't show up until the fake ending happens
2015-10-26 23:56:11	En_Passant	The goop throughout the game foreshadows something strange, but other than that, everything occurs when you're sucked into a disturbance as it's happening
2015-10-26 23:56:24	En_Passant	Which is at the end of the game
2015-10-26 23:56:26	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-26 23:56:40	ScruffyChat	I don't think the disturbances should be radiation-based
2015-10-26 23:56:49	ScruffyChat	As long as you're referring to nuclear radiation, that it
2015-10-26 23:56:50	ScruffyChat	is*
2015-10-26 23:57:05	En_Passant	Of course
2015-10-26 23:57:13	En_Passant	It's cliche and inaccurate
2015-10-26 23:57:25	ScruffyChat	Heh it doesn't have to be
2015-10-26 23:57:34	En_Passant	Again, I don't plan on describing anything about the disturbances, just that they're there
2015-10-26 23:57:39	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-26 23:57:46	En_Passant	I
2015-10-26 23:57:48	En_Passant	urgh
2015-10-26 23:57:56	En_Passant	Hate the comma being next to enter
2015-10-26 23:58:10	En_Passant	Still not used to the smaller keys on my new computer after two months, I guess
2015-10-26 23:58:12	ScruffyChat	Haha
2015-10-26 23:58:18	ScruffyChat	No it's no problem
2015-10-26 23:58:48	En_Passant	I'll totally theorize what the disturbances are, but that won't be in Pikmin V
2015-10-26 23:59:08	En_Passant	Right now, I'm thinking the disturbances are clouds of minute particles of the goop
2015-10-26 23:59:31	En_Passant	When it passes through an area, it accumulates on metal and can become intelligent
2015-10-26 23:59:31	ScruffyChat	Ah, and these manipulate metal even in the air?
2015-10-27 00:00:01	En_Passant	Well, if a metal object passes through them in the air, it would accumulate
2015-10-27 00:00:08	En_Passant	Much like real clouds
2015-10-27 00:00:13	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 00:00:59	ScruffyChat	That's an interesting element to it; intelligence in numbers
2015-10-27 00:01:18	ScruffyChat	so a huge glob of it would be super-intelligent
2015-10-27 00:02:21	En_Passant	Yeah, somewhat like the evolution of real organisms
2015-10-27 00:02:57	En_Passant	More cells meant more capabilities, especially once neurons evolved
2015-10-27 00:03:04	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 00:03:11	ScruffyChat	Now is the goop an organism?
2015-10-27 00:03:32	En_Passant	Probably
2015-10-27 00:03:35	ScruffyChat	If so, it needs to maintain homeostasis somehow
2015-10-27 00:04:10	ScruffyChat	As in, consuming energy, using energy, reproducing
2015-10-27 00:05:37	En_Passant	I don't think that's very important to the worldbuilding
2015-10-27 00:07:07	ScruffyChat	I guess not
2015-10-27 00:08:18	ScruffyChat	Just, in imagining this goop, I wonder where it came from, and if it were an organism, that would mean nature as the Pikmin series knows it produced it somehow
2015-10-27 00:08:34	En_Passant	It could also be mutated
2015-10-27 00:08:40	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-27 00:08:55	En_Passant	Either radiation or bioengineering would be manmade causes of it
2015-10-27 00:09:46	ScruffyChat	Which would make the organism extremely durable, like the Plasm Wraith
2015-10-27 00:09:55	ScruffyChat	How would you "defeat" it?
2015-10-27 00:10:47	En_Passant	The goop likely has different variation, plasm being one of them
2015-10-27 00:11:03	En_Passant	I'm not sure about defeating it
2015-10-27 00:11:14	En_Passant	I haven't done much planning on the final boss
2015-10-27 00:11:31	ScruffyChat	That's okay, sorry we don't need to detail that yet
2015-10-27 00:11:47	ScruffyChat	It's just important what happens before you face it and after the battle is done
2015-10-27 00:11:50	ScruffyChat	If you battle it
2015-10-27 00:11:54	ScruffyChat	And I assume you win
2015-10-27 00:12:06	En_Passant	Well, yeah
2015-10-27 00:12:24	En_Passant	I do have the endings on the page
2015-10-27 00:12:39	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 00:12:49	En_Passant	I guess I can add a part before treasure review is done
2015-10-27 00:13:16	ScruffyChat	Oh also, what is the odd hole going to be?
2015-10-27 00:13:38	En_Passant	The Distortion Hole...
2015-10-27 00:13:44	En_Passant	(final dungeon)
2015-10-27 00:13:54	ScruffyChat	I see
2015-10-27 00:14:13	En_Passant	Do I need to make that more clear on the page?
2015-10-27 00:14:30	ScruffyChat	No no, I can tell it's a dungeon
2015-10-27 00:15:26	ScruffyChat	It's just that, with "disturbances," a final hole called the Distortion Hole...
2015-10-27 00:15:39	ScruffyChat	It seems like the goop is not the only problem with PNF-404
2015-10-27 00:15:51	ScruffyChat	There's also some sort of spatial anomaly
2015-10-27 00:16:25	En_Passant	The disturbances are likely going to be the goop
2015-10-27 00:16:37	ScruffyChat	Ah okay
2015-10-27 00:17:11	ScruffyChat	Sorry, sorry, don't mean to distort your idea
2015-10-27 00:17:26	ScruffyChat	I'm just a huge fan of hyperdimensional fiction
2015-10-27 00:17:29	En_Passant	nice pun
2015-10-27 00:17:39	ScruffyChat	Eh, I've had better
2015-10-27 00:18:23	ScruffyChat	Well then, to suggest the problem of goop before the end of the game
2015-10-27 00:18:34	ScruffyChat	Umm
2015-10-27 00:18:36	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure
2015-10-27 00:18:47	ScruffyChat	Perhaps you could have a Distortion Hole in every region
2015-10-27 00:18:51	ScruffyChat	Something out of place
2015-10-27 00:19:06	ScruffyChat	To help along the connection that this goop is causing problems on PNF-404
2015-10-27 00:19:13	En_Passant	Keep in mind that most of the caves are optional
2015-10-27 00:19:42	En_Passant	The Distortion Hole is also the outstanding example because you're in a passing disturbance
2015-10-27 00:19:46	ScruffyChat	ah
2015-10-27 00:20:02	ScruffyChat	Well maybe you could have more sections of areas that are constructed of metal
2015-10-27 00:20:12	ScruffyChat	But not in a recognizable human way
2015-10-27 00:20:13	ScruffyChat	Like
2015-10-27 00:20:21	En_Passant	That's a good idea
2015-10-27 00:20:27	ScruffyChat	You can tell that the metal is arranged, not randomly distributed
2015-10-27 00:20:34	En_Passant	Well
2015-10-27 00:20:49	En_Passant	Randomly distributed metal is ore in the ground, so that's a given
2015-10-27 00:20:55	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 00:21:23	ScruffyChat	But yeah, maybe a section of area made of strewn metal objects
2015-10-27 00:21:38	ScruffyChat	Or even of carved metal ore
2015-10-27 00:23:22	En_Passant	I don't want to add goop to those objects, because it devalues the story-important goop
2015-10-27 00:24:04	ScruffyChat	That's true
2015-10-27 00:24:46	ScruffyChat	But then again, you'll find more metal on PNF-404 than just the spaceships and leaders
2015-10-27 00:25:00	En_Passant	Of course
2015-10-27 00:25:16	En_Passant	Some of the treasures are metal
2015-10-27 00:25:20	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 00:25:28	ScruffyChat	You're right, things like that shouldn
2015-10-27 00:25:33	ScruffyChat	ugh
2015-10-27 00:25:38	En_Passant	lol
2015-10-27 00:25:39	ScruffyChat	I see what you mean with the comma
2015-10-27 00:25:48	ScruffyChat	Things like that shouldn't be gooped
2015-10-27 00:25:55	En_Passant	Also, it's an apostrophe, we're both dumb
2015-10-27 00:25:59	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2015-10-27 00:26:05	ScruffyChat	You know what I mean
2015-10-27 00:26:27	ScruffyChat	the little dot with a tail
2015-10-27 00:27:17	En_Passant	,';;',;,',;',;',;'
2015-10-27 00:27:32	ScruffyChat	Yep, yep
2015-10-27 00:27:35	En_Passant	Trolling is fun
2015-10-27 00:27:40	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-10-27 00:27:54	ScruffyChat	I had a 2D game in my head once
2015-10-27 00:28:01	ScruffyChat	And there was an enemy called the Lonely Comma
2015-10-27 00:28:07	ScruffyChat	That was just a comma that hopped along
2015-10-27 00:28:28	ScruffyChat	To trip you up while you're being chased by something
2015-10-27 00:28:53	ScruffyChat	But anyway, that doesn't matter
2015-10-27 00:29:28	ScruffyChat	Oh also
2015-10-27 00:30:09	ScruffyChat	By "impossible" to leave the Endless Plains, do you mean they can't lift off at all? Or they can lift off but not select any other area?
2015-10-27 00:30:57	En_Passant	Can't lift off at all
2015-10-27 00:31:12	ScruffyChat	So they're stuck there at night too
2015-10-27 00:31:26	En_Passant	Yep
2015-10-27 00:31:37	ScruffyChat	The other areas really need to lead up to this
2015-10-27 00:31:50	ScruffyChat	Somehow
2015-10-27 00:31:57	En_Passant	Well, that's why there's a fake ending
2015-10-27 00:32:20	ScruffyChat	Ahhh I see
2015-10-27 00:32:21	ScruffyChat	Clever
2015-10-27 00:33:22	ScruffyChat	but I see what you mean
2015-10-27 00:33:30	ScruffyChat	You need to throw in some dramatic irony
2015-10-27 00:33:47	ScruffyChat	The player will know it's a bad idea to store the goop, but the leaders won't
2015-10-27 00:34:54	ScruffyChat	I feel you already deliver that idea well
2015-10-27 00:35:33	ScruffyChat	But without showing somehow that it accumulates on metal other than the spaceships, it seems much more supernatural
2015-10-27 00:37:50	ScruffyChat	Perhaps with metal floating in low orbit?
2015-10-27 00:38:10	ScruffyChat	Although... that wasn't present in the previous games, it might seem too out of place
2015-10-27 00:49:34	En_Passant	I guess it could show up on a few metal objects that are lying around
2015-10-27 00:50:05	En_Passant	It would be disposed of just like what the Plasm Wraith dropped
2015-10-27 00:51:07	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-27 00:51:23	ScruffyChat	But Alph wanted to research it
2015-10-27 00:51:32	ScruffyChat	Is there some payoff to getting rid of it?
2015-10-27 00:52:49	En_Passant	No
2015-10-27 00:53:08	En_Passant	It could be a side object similar to most of the Spotcaps
2015-10-27 00:53:26	ScruffyChat	Ah, I see
2015-10-27 00:53:44	En_Passant	They could take note of it similarly to how they did in P3
2015-10-27 00:54:18	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-27 00:54:31	ScruffyChat	And then it would become commonplace for the player to simply get rid of it
2015-10-27 00:55:13	En_Passant	I doubt it would show up too often
2015-10-27 00:55:45	En_Passant	Just enough so players feel like it didn't come out of left field
2015-10-27 00:56:21	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-27 00:56:32	ScruffyChat	Otherwise they would wonder why it's showing up so often
2015-10-27 01:01:38	En_Passant	How should I connect it to the cyborg creatures?
2015-10-27 01:02:06	En_Passant	Or should I?
2015-10-27 01:02:19	ScruffyChat	Well, how many will there be?
2015-10-27 01:02:27	En_Passant	I don't know
2015-10-27 01:02:39	En_Passant	I wasn't planning on including either the Groink or the Man-at-Legs
2015-10-27 01:04:06	ScruffyChat	I feel like they don't have to be cyborgs
2015-10-27 01:04:23	ScruffyChat	Just, creatures that have adapted and use metal objects to their advantage
2015-10-27 01:05:08	En_Passant	Remember what Olimar said in his notes on the Man-at-Legs
2015-10-27 01:05:18	En_Passant	It doesn't have any predators, so it wouldn't need to do that
2015-10-27 01:05:40	En_Passant	He suggested that maybe the machine approached the creature, which I would like to explain with the goop
2015-10-27 01:08:32	ScruffyChat	Ah, I see
2015-10-27 01:09:17	ScruffyChat	Well, perhaps if you encounter any robotic animals like that, defeating them separates the goop-machinery and the animal
2015-10-27 01:09:49	ScruffyChat	At no time is the goop machinery collectible or anything, it just shows that the two are different entities that came together
2015-10-27 01:12:10	En_Passant	I could, if I decide to have those enemies
2015-10-27 01:12:33	En_Passant	I guess that's not plot-related, though
2015-10-27 01:13:12	ScruffyChat	I guess
2015-10-27 01:13:24	ScruffyChat	Unless each boss is somehow part mechanized
2015-10-27 01:13:35	En_Passant	I'd rather not
2015-10-27 01:14:47	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-27 01:15:02	ScruffyChat	Yeah, your bosses are too cool for that
2015-10-27 01:15:26	ScruffyChat	I mean, Cometdust Magjay?
2015-10-27 01:15:28	ScruffyChat	That's awesome
2015-10-27 01:16:57	ScruffyChat	Perhaps you could have metal-based obstacles
2015-10-27 01:17:19	ScruffyChat	Overcoming them reveals some sort of goopy evidence
2015-10-27 01:17:26	ScruffyChat	And you wonder what could have built them
2015-10-27 01:17:50	ScruffyChat	Alph mentions "Intelligent life?" at the beginning of P3 and that question goes unanswered
2015-10-27 01:18:04	ScruffyChat	With the dirt walls, that is
2015-10-27 01:18:50	En_Passant	The bosses do have relevance to the goop
2015-10-27 01:19:00	En_Passant	As for the intelligent life, that's a question for another time
2015-10-27 01:19:10	En_Passant	Dirt walls are mostly a game mechanic, anyway
2015-10-27 01:19:42	ScruffyChat	Why do the bosses ingest goop?
2015-10-27 01:19:53	ScruffyChat	Is it because they've ingested metal-suited leaders?
2015-10-27 01:20:04	En_Passant	Only one ingested a metal-suited leader
2015-10-27 01:20:11	En_Passant	The other ingested metal parts
2015-10-27 01:20:20	ScruffyChat	Right, sorry, yes
2015-10-27 01:20:27	En_Passant	And the last of the goop is on the Drake, which isn't ingested
2015-10-27 01:21:45	En_Passant	Maybe the goop attracts animals
2015-10-27 01:25:16	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-27 01:25:25	ScruffyChat	So it attracts animals, and is attracted to metal
2015-10-27 01:25:31	ScruffyChat	if(
2015-10-27 01:25:34	ScruffyChat	if*
2015-10-27 01:25:41	En_Passant	If what?
2015-10-27 01:25:52	ScruffyChat	if it attracts animals, and is attracted to metal
2015-10-27 01:26:03	ScruffyChat	then it seems like it's meant to bring the two together
2015-10-27 01:28:00	En_Passant	I can roll with that
2015-10-27 01:28:29	En_Passant	It'll probably be a small reference in one of their Piklopedia entries or something
2015-10-27 01:29:19	ScruffyChat	Sure
2015-10-27 01:29:49	ScruffyChat	Sorry if it seems a little less human-caused now
2015-10-27 01:30:56	-->	Nvortex (Mibbit@189.158.mqz.qxw) has joined #pikipedia
2015-10-27 01:31:08	En_Passant	The only thing human caused is the goop
2015-10-27 01:31:17	En_Passant	But again, that's not in the game at all
2015-10-27 01:31:54	Nvortex	what are you guys talking about?
2015-10-27 01:32:09	ScruffyChat	Pikmin V plot
2015-10-27 01:32:19	Nvortex	5?!
2015-10-27 01:32:23	Nvortex	4 isnt even out yet...
2015-10-27 01:32:32	En_Passant	lol
2015-10-27 01:32:38	En_Passant	[[f:Pikmin V]]
2015-10-27 01:32:44	En_Passant	Wait, Testyo's not here
2015-10-27 01:33:09	ScruffyChat	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_V
2015-10-27 01:33:24	En_Passant	It's my fangame
2015-10-27 01:33:29	Nvortex	oh
2015-10-27 01:33:37	Nvortex	i knew en passant seemed like a familiar name
2015-10-27 01:33:43	Nvortex	i completely forgot about this
2015-10-27 01:33:51	En_Passant	I was waiting to save my edits to post the link, sorry
2015-10-27 01:34:07	En_Passant	You've looked at my game before?
2015-10-27 01:34:18	Nvortex	just looked ober it
2015-10-27 01:34:23	Nvortex	didnt read it whole
2015-10-27 01:34:30	Nvortex	i will read it right now
2015-10-27 01:35:16	Nvortex	wait what edits?
2015-10-27 01:35:20	Nvortex	cant i read it yet?
2015-10-27 01:35:26	En_Passant	You can
2015-10-27 01:35:42	En_Passant	I just added in some of what we were discussing about
2015-10-27 01:36:35	Nvortex	wait what does this mean exactly?
2015-10-27 01:36:36	Nvortex	Pluck cancelling no longer exists because it defies physics and logic.
2015-10-27 01:36:51	En_Passant	In Pikmin 3, you could cancel the plucking animation
2015-10-27 01:37:01	En_Passant	The Pikmin would still come out of the ground on its own
2015-10-27 01:37:03	Nvortex	really?
2015-10-27 01:37:06	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-10-27 01:37:13	En_Passant	Not a glitch, either
2015-10-27 01:37:43	Nvortex	the thing i hate the most is the insta pluck
2015-10-27 01:37:55	Nvortex	lie the seed comes out and you can take it out instantly
2015-10-27 01:38:01	Nvortex	the pikmin doesnt get to gro
2015-10-27 01:38:02	Nvortex	w
2015-10-27 01:38:04	En_Passant	Me too
2015-10-27 01:38:11	En_Passant	I'll add a note that that's gone too
2015-10-27 01:41:34	Nvortex	other thing i hate, teletransporting berries/grapes/fragments
2015-10-27 01:45:52	ScruffyChat	Makes no sense, even though it's less confusing I guess
2015-10-27 01:47:16	ScruffyChat	Oh, En_Passant, how are you going to have caves work?
2015-10-27 01:47:56	ScruffyChat	Wait, I can look it up
2015-10-27 01:49:35	ScruffyChat	Right right
2015-10-27 01:49:42	ScruffyChat	I like the way you organize caves
2015-10-27 01:50:04	ScruffyChat	Makes more sense than sublevels
2015-10-27 01:53:59	En_Passant	I still need an idea for the last area in Polar Mountain
2015-10-27 01:56:15	ScruffyChat	Is Clear Creek frozen over?
2015-10-27 01:57:55	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing not, since Blue Pikmin are discovered there?
2015-10-27 01:58:24	En_Passant	It's not
2015-10-27 01:58:27	ScruffyChat	Ok
2015-10-27 01:58:44	ScruffyChat	Then the third area could be an interior ice cave
2015-10-27 01:59:12	En_Passant	There are a few reasons why I don't like that
2015-10-27 01:59:24	En_Passant	1. Sealed Valley is a big cave already
2015-10-27 01:59:51	En_Passant	2. The Magjay is in the area, and I intend it to be on the roof of the building that is the "mountain"
2015-10-27 02:00:01	En_Passant	3. I can easily make Clear Creek's cave do that
2015-10-27 02:00:09	ScruffyChat	Ah, okay
2015-10-27 02:00:47	ScruffyChat	So, there's a building in the area that is the mountain?
2015-10-27 02:01:01	ScruffyChat	Or is that just a cave underneath the area?
2015-10-27 02:01:40	En_Passant	The region takes place around the building
2015-10-27 02:01:47	En_Passant	Large amounts of snow make it look like a mountain
2015-10-27 02:01:52	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-27 02:02:52	ScruffyChat	Well in that case, the third area could be the entire roof of the building, with snow and ice piled on
2015-10-27 02:03:01	ScruffyChat	in a terrain fashion
2015-10-27 02:06:16	ScruffyChat	And it could be called a summit
2015-10-27 02:06:20	ScruffyChat	or peak
2015-10-27 02:06:28	En_Passant	It could
2015-10-27 02:06:50	En_Passant	It would have to be disconnected from the first area, though
2015-10-27 02:06:53	En_Passant	I had that originally
2015-10-27 02:07:15	En_Passant	But I want the game to be as open as possible
2015-10-27 02:07:26	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-27 02:08:07	ScruffyChat	Well maybe Shimmering Ridge is part way up the "mountain?"
2015-10-27 02:08:23	ScruffyChat	Actually, I don't know how to connect those in that case
2015-10-27 02:10:37	ScruffyChat	Unless the building isn't straight, it's fallen at an angle
2015-10-27 02:11:10	ScruffyChat	Then the Clear Creek could be at the base, the Shimmering Ridge to climb up one of the slanted sides, and the last area be the roof
2015-10-27 02:11:20	Nvortex	wait what do you mean by polar moutnain?
2015-10-27 02:11:25	Nvortex	like in the north pole?
2015-10-27 02:11:32	En_Passant	no
2015-10-27 02:11:53	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-27 02:12:16	ScruffyChat	You may want a different adjective then
2015-10-27 02:12:35	ScruffyChat	Although, Olimar could believe it to be at the planet's pole
2015-10-27 02:12:46	ScruffyChat	As long as someone describes it that way
2015-10-27 02:13:43	En_Passant	Is Europe at one of the poles on Pangaea Ultima?
2015-10-27 02:13:59	En_Passant	Because the whole continent's snowy in Pikmin 3
2015-10-27 02:14:21	Nvortex	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pangaeaultima_a.gtx.png
2015-10-27 02:14:23	ScruffyChat	oh, it is
2015-10-27 02:14:34	Nvortex	theres no pole
2015-10-27 02:14:37	ScruffyChat	Sorry, forgot we were using Pangea
2015-10-27 02:14:38	Nvortex	theres groenland though
2015-10-27 02:15:22	ScruffyChat	Seems to be Africa, or maybe a bit of Spain
2015-10-27 02:15:36	Nvortex	wait what are you talking about?
2015-10-27 02:15:55	Nvortex	the frozen continent is the entirety of asia and europe
2015-10-27 02:16:05	Nvortex	africa is the top
2015-10-27 02:18:14	Nvortex	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Clawed_Pikmin
2015-10-27 02:18:15	Nvortex	huh?
2015-10-27 02:19:21	ScruffyChat	Odd that they chose Eurasia to be frozen when it's not at the pole of Pangea though
2015-10-27 02:19:46	Nvortex	tilted axis or magneticshift
2015-10-27 02:19:56	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-27 02:20:05	Nvortex	or wobbly axis
2015-10-27 02:20:38	Nvortex	wait now that i remember magnetic shifts dont interefere with weather
2015-10-27 02:20:40	Nvortex	my bad
2015-10-27 02:20:40	ScruffyChat	Does it bother anyone else that you can tell the stars behind PNF-404 are the inside of a big-but-not-big-enough sphere?
2015-10-27 02:20:49	Nvortex	yes
2015-10-27 02:20:58	Nvortex	and that there are "closer" stars
2015-10-27 02:20:59	En_Passant	Uh, what?
2015-10-27 02:21:17	Nvortex	what what?
2015-10-27 02:21:18	ScruffyChat	When it zooms in on the S.S. Drake before the area selection screen
2015-10-27 02:21:28	Nvortex	the clawed pikmin?
2015-10-27 02:21:32	Nvortex	" "
2015-10-27 02:21:43	En_Passant	@Clawed Pikmin: Yeah, I realized I haven't added its info to that page, I redirected the link on the page
2015-10-27 02:21:54	En_Passant	I was saying what to the star thing
2015-10-27 02:22:02	En_Passant	I don't have the game so I have no idea what you're talking about
2015-10-27 02:22:10	ScruffyChat	Oh okay
2015-10-27 02:22:15	Nvortex	oh yeah, it looks like the inside of a sphere seen from the drake
2015-10-27 02:22:35	Nvortex	or the ending screen, there are stars that look as if they were in 3d
2015-10-27 02:22:35	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2015-10-27 02:23:12	ScruffyChat	The star background is a texture on a big sphere
2015-10-27 02:24:07	ScruffyChat	But the sphere isn't big enough, there's too much parallax and you can tell the stars are much closer-looking than they should be
2015-10-27 02:24:28	ScruffyChat	It's okay though
2015-10-27 02:24:47	ScruffyChat	It's not a huge crime or anything
2015-10-27 02:42:04	En_Passant	Question: What's a Sprawn?
2015-10-27 02:42:09	En_Passant	It's hard to tell from the render
2015-10-27 02:42:27	En_Passant	It looks like half of a clam shell with a spiral shell sticking out as a horn
2015-10-27 02:44:43	Nvortex	where did you see that?
2015-10-27 02:45:04	Nvortex	its like a shrimp from what i kno
2015-10-27 02:45:05	Nvortex	w
2015-10-27 02:52:53	ScruffyChat	It's a spiral shell
2015-10-27 02:53:08	ScruffyChat	The clam shell part is actually the body: it's translucent
2015-10-27 02:53:19	ScruffyChat	Sorry it's hard to tell, I should re-render with a good background
2015-10-27 02:55:42	ScruffyChat	The part with two eyes is the body: it's gelatinous and sticky
2015-10-27 03:00:03	En_Passant	How does it behave?
2015-10-27 03:01:11	ScruffyChat	It slithers along the ground in that posture
2015-10-27 03:01:43	ScruffyChat	But when it sees Pikmin it hops into the air and turns over, and drills its shell partially into the ground
2015-10-27 03:02:52	ScruffyChat	Its shell "inhales" and then its body splays out in front of it, it acts a bit like the consistency of honey
2015-10-27 03:03:05	ScruffyChat	Any Pikmin caught in this spray will be eaten
2015-10-27 03:03:30	ScruffyChat	But I'm thinking it might be like the Armored Cannon Beetle, where a Pikmin inhaled will harm it
2015-10-27 03:03:36	ScruffyChat	Or at least expose it
2015-10-27 03:03:50	ScruffyChat	And a Rock Pikmin can break the shell, or Lichen Pikmin can break it down
2015-10-27 03:06:52	ScruffyChat	It has half the health of a Red Bulborb
2015-10-27 03:08:08	Nvortex	i thought you were asking about the real life animal...
2015-10-27 03:08:09	Nvortex	lol
2015-10-27 03:21:56	Nvortex	>hocotate having found fruit first >charlie having a replica of the rubber ugly >louie confusing the duck with treasure >the drake having the database of the fruit (confirmed in the insect condo entry in both versions and having the same name in pikmin 2)
2015-10-27 03:21:58	Nvortex	it all makes sense now, the governmet of koppai was never trying to save koppai, they already knew about the fruit of the distant planet but they still sent the speros for whatever reason, the drake suddenly failing.
2015-10-27 03:22:07	Nvortex	open your eyes people, the drake was programmed to fail upon entry to the planet, the "lost" of the cosmic drive key was also planned, alph has always been the "nice guy" IT WAS ALL AN ACT. 
2015-10-27 03:22:18	Nvortex	the plasm wraith is a countermeasure that came with the spero to make it less possible to get the cosmic drive key, it was programmed that way, thats why it was attracted to "olimar"
2015-10-27 03:22:24	Nvortex	[09:18:55 p.m.] El Vorto: he had the key [09:19:00 p.m.] El Vorto: koppai cant melt steel beams [09:19:07 p.m.] El Vorto: open your eyes pikmin
2015-10-27 03:22:37	Nvortex	bullshit joke conspiracy theory i had
2015-10-27 03:25:23	Nvortex	"perhaps it wasnt an accident after all"
2015-10-27 03:25:26	Nvortex	you bet it wasnt

2015-10-27 19:08:03	Yoshi2	as far as I can tell, programming for the micro controller in C is the same as programming for PC in C
2015-10-27 19:08:07	Yoshi2	I'm quite suprised
2015-10-27 19:09:49	@Espyo	hm, neat
2015-10-27 19:10:37	Yoshi2	I guess C is C
2015-10-27 19:11:10	Yoshi2	of course, there is a lot of stuff done by the compiler so we can do things like read data from pins and 
2015-10-27 19:11:28	Yoshi2	make LEDs light up and write something on a LCD display

2015-10-27 20:13:40	@Espyo	hm?
2015-10-27 20:13:49	ScruffyChat	I've been reading through the Pikmin 3 voyage log (that's really impressive, great job by the way!)
2015-10-27 20:14:34	ScruffyChat	In the European version one miscellaneous note from Charlie says their only sleeping places are sleeping bags with cryogenic functions
2015-10-27 20:14:37	@Espyo	NWPlayer made a program that grabbed the msbt files and wrote their content in a cleaner manner
2015-10-27 20:14:47	@Espyo	I just grabbed the Python script that did it and made it export everything to a file
2015-10-27 20:14:48	ScruffyChat	That's really cool
2015-10-27 20:14:52	@Espyo	it was actually quite fun to do
2015-10-27 20:14:57	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-10-27 20:15:06	@Espyo	oh, I remember reading that one, yeah
2015-10-27 20:15:10	@Espyo	I uh... didn't read most of them
2015-10-27 20:15:14	@Espyo	hey, article's still a WIP!
2015-10-27 20:15:24	ScruffyChat	No problem no problem
2015-10-27 20:15:31	ScruffyChat	But that one just struck me
2015-10-27 20:15:39	ScruffyChat	Why would they need cryogenic functions?

2015-10-27 20:15:57	CaptPikmin	Hi!
2015-10-27 20:16:04	ScruffyChat	Hello!
2015-10-27 20:16:23	ScruffyChat	If the Drake works the way I think it does, it would warp to PNF-404 in a matter of seconds
2015-10-27 20:16:45	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that...
2015-10-27 20:16:48	@Espyo	hi CaptPikmin
2015-10-27 20:16:49	CaptPikmin	It's my first time in a monobook Chat, I remember when I contributed a few there...
2015-10-27 20:16:58	@Espyo	hehe
2015-10-27 20:17:04	ScruffyChat	Cryogenics are for preserving someone's physical integrity through a long space trek
2015-10-27 20:17:04	@Espyo	well, welcome
2015-10-27 20:17:24	@Espyo	yeah... and apparently these are just supposed to be for a night
2015-10-27 20:17:30	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 20:17:35	@Espyo	normally I'd expect NOA to add an overblown detail like that
2015-10-27 20:17:37	@Espyo	but NOE?
2015-10-27 20:17:40	ScruffyChat	So, maybe the Drake took longer than I thought
2015-10-27 20:17:51	ScruffyChat	to get to PNF-404, that is
2015-10-27 20:18:02	@Espyo	oh, I thought that that bit was for the daily sleeps
2015-10-27 20:18:05	@Espyo	not so much the huge travel
2015-10-27 20:18:12	@Espyo	but if it is for the huge travel, then...
2015-10-27 20:18:33	ScruffyChat	Then it implies it took the Drake at least 279,000 years to get to PNF-404
2015-10-27 20:19:11	ScruffyChat	Or at least, they couldn't warp spacetime enough to get it down to something like seconds
2015-10-27 20:19:16	ScruffyChat	It might have taken years
2015-10-27 20:19:43	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-27 20:19:47	ScruffyChat	That's what I worried about during my second or third playthrough
2015-10-27 20:19:52	@Espyo	of course it's all just "sci-fi sounding mumbo jumbo"
2015-10-27 20:19:57	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-27 20:19:59	@Espyo	but when you get into the details, it raises questions
2015-10-27 20:20:02	@Espyo	it's fun to analyse
2015-10-27 20:20:03	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 20:20:20	ScruffyChat	I hope they didn't return home to find a Koppai millions of years later
2015-10-27 20:21:18	@Espyo	I think I thought about that at one point
2015-10-27 20:21:21	@Espyo	it's... really grim
2015-10-27 20:21:25	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-27 20:21:33	ScruffyChat	I doubt that's the case in the story though
2015-10-27 20:21:46	ScruffyChat	Louie doesn't seem to age much between P2 and P3
2015-10-27 20:21:52	@Espyo	what if that's just the plot in P4?
2015-10-27 20:21:59	@Espyo	you return to Koppai, and it's all completely different
2015-10-27 20:22:06	@Espyo	I don't want to be grim and say everything is dead
2015-10-27 20:22:17	@Espyo	but just radically different; they figured out the food crisis
2015-10-27 20:22:21	ScruffyChat	Well that would mean every time you go to PNF-404, its millions of years later
2015-10-27 20:22:23	@Espyo	boy, the possibilities would be endless
2015-10-27 20:22:28	@Espyo	ah, yes, good point
2015-10-27 20:22:54	CaptPikmin	Well, or that means that they can live an eternity, or the game isn't as realistic as well, I think :v
2015-10-27 20:23:03	@Espyo	yeah
2015-10-27 20:23:16	ScruffyChat	They very well could
2015-10-27 20:23:27	ScruffyChat	It's not like they ever die even if they get heavily damaged
2015-10-27 20:24:06	ScruffyChat	I really hope P4 can give us some answers like this
2015-10-27 20:24:35	CaptPikmin	Yes...
2015-10-27 20:24:36	@Espyo	mhm
2015-10-27 20:31:29	CaptPikmin	It's really interesting the way that the series makes you lots of questions, and there are very elaborate answers...
2015-10-27 20:33:14	CaptPikmin	Sorry for the grammar errors, I'm spanish speaker, but I prefer being at english communities...
2015-10-27 20:34:25	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-10-27 20:34:52	ScruffyChat	I agree, the developers do a good job of very carefully revealing information
2015-10-27 20:35:26	ScruffyChat	But Pikmin 3 probably left me with the most questions of any game
2015-10-27 20:36:56	CaptPikmin	Yes, a new race with a new perspective of the planet is... wow
2015-10-27 20:38:16	CaptPikmin	I fing very intriguing the paradox of the time zones inside the caves in P2
2015-10-27 20:38:36	ScruffyChat	Yes
2015-10-27 20:38:57	ScruffyChat	It's explained by heavy magnetic shifts underground
2015-10-27 20:39:02	CaptPikmin	Yep
2015-10-27 20:40:18	ScruffyChat	If that were really how it happened, you would see Olimar and his Pikmin enter the cave, then immediately see them exit
2015-10-27 20:40:48	CaptPikmin	Yes, it would be really confusing xD
2015-10-27 20:43:28	CaptPikmin	It's amazing how a wiki remained active for that long, this proves that the Pikmin series are gems that need to be explored carefully, I edited here a few days until I realized the community was in a very good condition.

2015-10-27 20:44:29	@Espyo	I grabbed onto it with tooth and nail
2015-10-27 20:44:57	@Espyo	speaking of poking files, I think I'll dump more stuff tomorrow, like the check-in conversations at the Drake
2015-10-27 20:45:05	ScruffyChat	I was wondering if we should have an article on lighting
2015-10-27 20:45:17	ScruffyChat	I know it's described in "Day:
2015-10-27 20:45:24	ScruffyChat	"Day*
2015-10-27 20:46:07	ScruffyChat	But perhaps it would explain the difference in lighting between the games
2015-10-27 20:46:18	ScruffyChat	For example, the addition of a lens-flare
2015-10-27 20:46:28	ScruffyChat	And it would go into the different cave lighting colors
2015-10-27 20:47:48	CaptPikmin	Yes, there are lots of variable values that have a very important role in the gameplay, It would be very accurate if there are pages about the lighting.
2015-10-27 20:49:53	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-10-27 20:49:58	@Espyo	would there be anything else to say?
2015-10-27 20:51:04	CaptPikmin	Hmm...
2015-10-27 20:51:08	ScruffyChat	Well, I could also mention shadows, like ones cast by Pikmin and enemies, and ones by trees
2015-10-27 20:51:21	ScruffyChat	And how P3 leaders produce their own light
2015-10-27 20:51:34	ScruffyChat	Now that I think about it, that's not all that much to say
2015-10-27 20:52:43	CaptPikmin	That could feet in a page about aditional lighting effects and something like that, I think, or a section.
2015-10-27 20:53:15	@Espyo	hm
2015-10-27 20:53:18	@Espyo	I guess we could
2015-10-27 20:53:27	@Espyo	well, if you want to write it, go ahead
2015-10-27 20:53:36	@Espyo	or at least on the sandbox, so we can get a grip of its size and content
2015-10-27 20:53:43	@Espyo	I love articles about these sort of things
2015-10-27 20:53:47	ScruffyChat	I'll give a shot and see if it feels too stub-ish
2015-10-27 20:53:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-27 20:53:51	@Espyo	all right
2015-10-27 20:54:10	ScruffyChat	So I can just add it on the sandbox and leave it there?
2015-10-27 20:55:13	ScruffyChat	Because the navbox test is already there
2015-10-27 20:55:20	ScruffyChat	Should I just add it at the bottom?
2015-10-27 20:56:51	@Espyo	yeah, to the bottom
2015-10-27 20:56:52	@Espyo	or above

2015-10-27 21:19:53	@PikFan	hi
2015-10-27 21:19:59	CaptPikmin	Hi
2015-10-27 21:20:53	@Espyo	hey
2015-10-27 21:22:37	ScruffyChat	Hi
2015-10-27 21:23:47	@PikFan	oh, Scruffy
2015-10-27 21:23:58	@PikFan	so I had an idea for a new fic
2015-10-27 21:24:03	ScruffyChat	fic?
2015-10-27 21:24:08	@PikFan	fanfic
2015-10-27 21:24:13	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2015-10-27 21:24:28	@PikFan	it's basically a sequel to Pikmin: The Lost Days
2015-10-27 21:24:40	@PikFan	except this time it takes place in between P2 and P3
2015-10-27 21:24:52	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-27 21:24:54	ScruffyChat	Neat!
2015-10-27 21:25:13	@PikFan	my theory for why the Onions in P3 are so mechanical is that the original Onions from P1+2 were destroyed
2015-10-27 21:25:14	ScruffyChat	Just an idea so far? Or have you written anything
2015-10-27 21:25:20	@PikFan	so the Pikmin had to make new ones
2015-10-27 21:25:20	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-27 21:25:24	@PikFan	yes, I have
2015-10-27 21:25:26	@PikFan	not much, though
2015-10-27 21:25:30	ScruffyChat	that's okay
2015-10-27 21:25:32	ScruffyChat	That's neat
2015-10-27 21:25:48	@PikFan	it's called Pikmin: The Stolen Years
2015-10-27 21:25:54	ScruffyChat	I guess it would explain then how they learned to settle their differences and cope with living in one Onion
2015-10-27 21:26:00	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-27 21:26:13	@PikFan	well, not really so much settle their differences
2015-10-27 21:26:39	@PikFan	I suppose I could incorporate that somehow, but it never seemed like they didn't get along
2015-10-27 21:27:20	ScruffyChat	Yea
2015-10-27 21:27:26	@PikFan	but anyway, unlike the Lost Days, which takes place right after P1 ends, the Stolen Years starts sometime between P2 and 3

2015-10-27 21:27:28	ScruffyChat	Well cool, that's exciting!
2015-10-27 21:27:32	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-27 21:27:51	ScruffyChat	They'd still discuss Olimar, yes/
2015-10-27 21:27:54	ScruffyChat	?*
2015-10-27 21:27:59	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-27 21:28:26	@PikFan	I'm thinking that the Wraiths will be important
2015-10-27 21:28:52	ScruffyChat	Yesss
2015-10-27 21:29:04	@PikFan	especially the Plasm Wraith
2015-10-27 21:29:22	ScruffyChat	Before you came on, we were discussing an interesting anomaly I saw in the P3 voyage log
2015-10-27 21:29:30	@PikFan	oh? do tell
2015-10-27 21:29:36	ScruffyChat	That said that the sleeping bags on the Drake had cryogenic functions
2015-10-27 21:29:57	@PikFan	ooh, cryogenic functions
2015-10-27 21:29:57	ScruffyChat	They wouldn't need cryogenic functions unless the Drake were to be travelling somewhere for a really long time
2015-10-27 21:30:12	CaptPikmin	Hmm...
2015-10-27 21:30:24	ScruffyChat	Which, to me, implied that the Drake could have taken longer than we imagined to get to PNF-404
2015-10-27 21:30:40	@PikFan	even traveling faster than light, I imagine it'd still take some time to travel the 279,000 light years
2015-10-27 21:30:47	ScruffyChat	Right
2015-10-27 21:30:54	@PikFan	also, this raises a problem
2015-10-27 21:31:01	ScruffyChat	Add it to the list
2015-10-27 21:31:12	@PikFan	what if they return with their seeds, but find that everyone died of starvation?
2015-10-27 21:31:17	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2015-10-27 21:31:43	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-27 21:31:45	CaptPikmin	Yes...
2015-10-27 21:31:47	ScruffyChat	What if every visit to PNF-404, you see it millions of years in the future because of relativity
2015-10-27 21:32:02	@PikFan	oh, there was a theory on that by Dave
2015-10-27 21:32:17	@PikFan	it... wasn't crystal clear, but I got the gist of what he was trying to say
2015-10-27 21:32:55	@PikFan	hmm
2015-10-27 21:33:13	@PikFan	technically you could bypass relativity if you could travel through 4D hyperspace
2015-10-27 21:33:32	@PikFan	...of course, 3D space would have to be heavily distorted for that to work
2015-10-27 21:33:40	ScruffyChat	Yes, that's a theory
2015-10-27 21:33:53	ScruffyChat	The Alcubierre drive
2015-10-27 21:34:12	ScruffyChat	It would take massive amounts of energy though
2015-10-27 21:34:21	@PikFan	oh, I thought the Alcubierre drive just contracted space in front of you and expanded it behind you?
2015-10-27 21:34:22	ScruffyChat	Even more so to escape from it
2015-10-27 21:34:29	@PikFan	not make a wormhole?
2015-10-27 21:34:38	ScruffyChat	Contracted spacetime in front and behind
2015-10-27 21:34:42	<--	CaptPikmin (Mibbit@190.219.woo.qs) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2015-10-27 21:35:04	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2015-10-27 21:35:06	ScruffyChat	A wormhole does the same thing
2015-10-27 21:35:23	ScruffyChat	But a wormhole would supposedly be natural, the drive would be artificial
2015-10-27 21:35:36	@PikFan	I've always thought that wormholes would connect to 4D or something
2015-10-27 21:35:55	ScruffyChat	They both connect to 4D
2015-10-27 21:36:04	@PikFan	...that can't be right
2015-10-27 21:36:19	ScruffyChat	I mean technically we're all 4D, because we can't see anything without time for the light to reach us
2015-10-27 21:36:28	@PikFan	as far as I know, the Alcubierre drive only interacts with 3D space
2015-10-27 21:36:36	ScruffyChat	Oh
2015-10-27 21:36:39	@PikFan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive
2015-10-27 21:37:24	ScruffyChat	Shoot, nevermind
2015-10-27 21:37:34	ScruffyChat	Well wormholes can transcend 4D space
2015-10-27 21:37:38	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-27 21:37:57	ScruffyChat	if they can transcend time, I think they're 5-dimensional
2015-10-27 21:38:24	ScruffyChat	because you can't fold spacetime without having space to fold it into
2015-10-27 21:38:34	@PikFan	this is theoretically what a wormhole would look like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Wurmloch.jpg
2015-10-27 21:39:17	ScruffyChat	But that's beside the point
2015-10-27 21:39:22	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-27 21:39:36	ScruffyChat	For even the Drake to get there would take huge amounts of energy
2015-10-27 21:39:36	@PikFan	all of this is besides the point
2015-10-27 21:39:40	ScruffyChat	Heh
2015-10-27 21:39:43	@PikFan	right
2015-10-27 21:39:53	ScruffyChat	Aww who cares, it's so much fun to talk sabout
2015-10-27 21:39:55	ScruffyChat	about*
2015-10-27 21:39:58	@PikFan	I mean, who knows what the cosmic drive key does
2015-10-27 21:40:20	ScruffyChat	I'd like to think it's an Alcubierre drive
2015-10-27 21:40:26	@PikFan	*shrug*
2015-10-27 21:40:46	@PikFan	well, if we ever get the chance of meeting Miyamoto, somebody has to ask
2015-10-27 21:41:07	ScruffyChat	He'll probably be like, "What are you talking about?"
2015-10-27 21:41:17	@PikFan	maybe
2015-10-27 21:42:30	ScruffyChat	But yeah, it's kind of grim
2015-10-27 21:42:46	ScruffyChat	To imagine the crew coming home to find Koppai millions of years after they left it
2015-10-27 21:42:52	ScruffyChat	But maybe it's not grim
2015-10-27 21:43:00	ScruffyChat	Maybe the Koppaite race is hyper-advanced
2015-10-27 21:43:21	@PikFan	perhaps
2015-10-27 21:43:37	ScruffyChat	Anyway, back to The Stolen Years
2015-10-27 21:43:53	ScruffyChat	Any notion of who the main character will be?
2015-10-27 21:44:00	@PikFan	but if they were hyper-advanced, then they should be able to genetically engineer themselves to tell their brains to tell their bodies that they're not hungry
2015-10-27 21:44:02	@PikFan	oh
2015-10-27 21:44:08	@PikFan	this time it's a Blue Pikmin
2015-10-27 21:44:37	@PikFan	and with this, I've got all the main types of Pikmin as a main character

2015-10-27 21:49:45	@PikFan	like "Ignis" is just Latin for "fire"

2015-10-27 21:55:25	@PikFan	ah
2015-10-27 21:55:32	@PikFan	well
2015-10-27 21:55:50	@PikFan	it's when the Onions were destroyed
2015-10-27 21:56:09	@PikFan	but during this time, the caves closed up, and new monsters appeared
2015-10-27 21:56:20	@PikFan	and the areas wildly transformed, again
2015-10-27 21:56:27	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-10-27 21:56:41	@PikFan	I'm thinking that Purples and Whites had to be converted into Rocks and Wingeds
2015-10-27 21:56:49	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-27 21:56:51	@PikFan	in order to survive
2015-10-27 21:56:55	ScruffyChat	But they appear in P3 as well?
2015-10-27 21:57:05	@PikFan	Purples and Whites? well yeah
2015-10-27 21:57:10	ScruffyChat	Maybe there were some left over
2015-10-27 21:57:14	@PikFan	but only in Mission Mode
2015-10-27 21:57:21	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-10-27 21:57:35	ScruffyChat	Maybe they never left the Hocotate ship
2015-10-27 21:57:49	@PikFan	ohhh

2015-10-27 21:58:13	@PikFan	...well, maybe I don't need to
2015-10-27 21:58:35	@PikFan	in the ending of P2, we see Purples and Whites along with all the other colors from up high
2015-10-27 21:58:56	@PikFan	but thanks for reminding me of that
2015-10-27 21:59:33	ScruffyChat	You will have to explain how the Hocotate ship ended up crashed in the Garden of Hope

2015-10-27 22:00:20	@PikFan	well, we know that Olimar and Louie returned to PNF-404 to pay off another debt
2015-10-27 22:00:43	@PikFan	so we can infer that they, again, used the Hocotate ship
2015-10-27 22:01:00	@PikFan	but Olimar got captured by the Plasm Wraith
2015-10-27 22:01:06	@PikFan	panicking, Louie tries to escape
2015-10-27 22:01:17	@PikFan	(bad, bad Louie)
2015-10-27 22:01:44	@PikFan	but then the Quaggled Mireclops captures him before he can escape
2015-10-27 22:01:44	ScruffyChat	I'm thinking of writing a story from the perspective of Louie
2015-10-27 22:01:49	@PikFan	and then the Ship is destroyed

2015-10-27 22:02:16	@PikFan	right

2015-10-27 22:03:58	@PikFan	clearly it's advanced technology
2015-10-27 22:04:05	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-10-27 22:04:12	@PikFan	maybe... finding Onion prototypes?
2015-10-27 22:04:16	@PikFan	in ruins of sorts?
2015-10-27 22:04:47	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmm
2015-10-27 22:04:57	@PikFan	oh, here's a wacky idea
2015-10-27 22:04:58	ScruffyChat	I always thought Onions to be hyperintelligent fruit

2015-10-27 22:05:15	@PikFan	what if the Plasm Wraith is actually extraterrestrial
2015-10-27 22:05:26	ScruffyChat	Seems likely
2015-10-27 22:05:41	@PikFan	hmm, yes, perhaps
2015-10-27 22:05:59	@PikFan	at the hyperintelligent fruit bit
2015-10-27 22:06:28	@PikFan	I'll work it out somehow
2015-10-27 22:06:47	@PikFan	but anyway, I'm thinking that if the Plasm Wraith is basically alien
2015-10-27 22:06:52	@PikFan	why not have more alien influence?
2015-10-27 22:07:22	@PikFan	maybe the reason why the Onions are so advanced is because Pikmin somehow learn from aliens
2015-10-27 22:07:36	@PikFan	*Onions are so advanced in P3
2015-10-27 22:07:47	ScruffyChat	Woah
2015-10-27 22:09:17	ScruffyChat	but then the Wraith turns on them
2015-10-27 22:09:31	@PikFan	mm...
2015-10-27 22:09:44	@PikFan	maybe
2015-10-27 22:10:00	@PikFan	I dunno, I just have this feeling that it's been antagonistic from the start
2015-10-27 22:10:14	@PikFan	maybe as an experiment gone wrong conducted by aliens
2015-10-27 22:10:34	@PikFan	so they happen to dump it on PNF-404, unaware of the Pikmin
2015-10-27 22:10:43	@PikFan	but then they observe the Pikmin
2015-10-27 22:10:57	@PikFan	and feeling pity, create a new Onion (or at least help them) for them
2015-10-27 22:11:42	ScruffyChat	Ahh
2015-10-27 22:11:54	ScruffyChat	So the Plasm Wraith is just an abomination
2015-10-27 22:11:59	@PikFan	exactly
2015-10-27 22:12:10	@PikFan	unfortunately, it becomes sentient
2015-10-27 22:12:25	@PikFan	and it develops feelings of resentment towards its creators
2015-10-27 22:12:39	@PikFan	and so it wreaks havoc
2015-10-27 22:13:50	@PikFan	the Plasm Wraith takes its shape because it originally found a Waterwraith
2015-10-27 22:14:18	@PikFan	the not-so-lucky Waterwraith was fused with this piece of goo that would become the Plasm Wraith
2015-10-27 22:14:44	@PikFan	it then abandons its rollers, seeing no use for them
2015-10-27 22:15:17	@PikFan	but having properties of the goo, it can change shape, light on fire, etc
2015-10-27 22:15:46	@PikFan	what do you think? is this all a bit over the top?
2015-10-27 22:18:04	ScruffyChat	Nothing's over the top
2015-10-27 22:18:18	@PikFan	true
2015-10-27 22:18:19	ScruffyChat	Go for it
2015-10-27 22:18:24	@PikFan	alright
2015-10-27 22:18:29	@PikFan	any suggestions?
2015-10-27 22:20:03	ScruffyChat	Maybe the Pikmin could revere these Onion-builders like deities
2015-10-27 22:20:27	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2015-10-27 22:20:31	@PikFan	good idea
2015-10-27 22:23:03	ScruffyChat	Which I guess could mean they hold ceremonies
2015-10-27 22:23:09	ScruffyChat	And fear the Plasm wraith
2015-10-27 22:23:12	ScruffyChat	Or something
2015-10-27 22:24:47	@PikFan	yeah
2015-10-27 22:24:54	@PikFan	that'd add depth to their culture
2015-10-27 22:24:56	@PikFan	I like it
2015-10-27 22:25:06	@PikFan	anyway, gotta go, we can talk about this more tomorrow

2015-10-28 19:33:19	ScruffyChat	Hi Espyo!
2015-10-28 19:33:32	ScruffyChat	Thanks for your comments on the lighting article
2015-10-28 19:34:04	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna get on Dolphin and P3 and find get some better pictures of some of the things I'm talking about
2015-10-28 19:34:12	ScruffyChat	And I agree it could use more information
2015-10-28 19:34:36	ScruffyChat	Do you have any suggestions for where to start with that, besides filling in how the Piklopedia handles nighttime?
2015-10-28 19:35:52	@Espyo	hi
2015-10-28 19:36:04	@Espyo	not really...
2015-10-28 19:36:15	@Espyo	I know we need more info, but I don't know what that info is
2015-10-28 19:37:48	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-28 19:38:14	Klemen702	heyp
2015-10-28 19:38:15	ScruffyChat	I can only get the subjective stuff, I don't know how to get objective info about lighting in the games
2015-10-28 19:38:16	Yoshi2	what things are you talking about?
2015-10-28 19:39:55	ScruffyChat	I wrote a potential article about lighting in the Pikmin series
2015-10-28 19:40:28	ScruffyChat	And it's more info than I thought it'd be, but still not enough
2015-10-28 19:42:06	@Espyo	hi
2015-10-28 19:42:22	@Espyo	yeah, it's more info than I thought it'd be, too
2015-10-28 19:42:26	@Espyo	it's good enough for an article
2015-10-28 19:42:34	@Espyo	has good amount of text, has images, has interest
2015-10-28 19:42:44	@Espyo	but it just feels like there's one or two subjects that are being ignored
2015-10-28 19:42:47	@Espyo	and I can't put my finger on them
2015-10-28 19:43:53	Yoshi2	Espyo: I'm not sure what the issue is here
2015-10-28 19:44:07	Yoshi2	though I'm also not sure how you can write an article about lighting
2015-10-28 19:44:13	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-10-28 19:44:23	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-28 19:44:36	@Espyo	might as well do the other tasks to brighten up (hurr) the article
2015-10-28 19:44:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-28 19:44:51	@Espyo	and then we can see more clearly (hurr) if it's worth making it a real article
2015-10-28 19:44:54	@Espyo	probably is, though
2015-10-28 19:45:08	@Espyo	aaaaand wikia has another vandal http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/File:NI_Pikmin2DuoNews_colmImg_005-1-.jpg
2015-10-28 19:45:15	@Espyo	please, PLEASE don't let anybody see it and revert it
2015-10-28 19:45:22	@Espyo	we might get another RRabit52 or whatever his name is
2015-10-28 19:49:06	Klemen702	wait
2015-10-28 19:49:26	Klemen702	if it's reverted (allthrough still bad) woudn't that make it so he doesn't do a thing?
2015-10-28 19:53:07	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2015-10-28 19:54:20	Klemen702	if someone reverts the troll woudn't that make it so he won't deal with it?
2015-10-28 19:54:36	Klemen702	(screenshot doesn't work for me btw)
2015-10-28 19:55:02	Klemen702	(or link)
2015-10-28 19:56:34	@Espyo	not quite sure what you mean by dealing with it
2015-10-28 19:56:42	@Espyo	if it gets reverted, the image goes back to what it was
2015-10-28 19:56:50	@Espyo	but the troll is still there
2015-10-28 19:56:52	@Espyo	until he's banned

2015-10-28 21:40:24	@Espyo	I think the biggest problem would be the quick throws and throwing Pikmin at the Iridescent Flint Beetle perfectly

2015-10-29 00:55:04	ScruffyChat	So far I've had the suggestions SOGNO, FISSO, and A1-Ut0

2015-10-29 02:46:01	En_Passant	hmm? sorry
2015-10-29 02:46:09	En_Passant	Maybe make it related to the SPEROs?
2015-10-29 02:47:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah that's what I was thinking
2015-10-29 02:48:09	ScruffyChat	Except I've changed it to be a space rover
2015-10-29 02:48:14	ScruffyChat	It'll walk on legs
2015-10-29 02:48:25	ScruffyChat	legs kind of like the Man at Legs
2015-10-29 02:48:51	ScruffyChat	I'm thinking of removing the Man at Legs from my game and put some of the abilities I was thinking it would have into this boss

2015-10-29 02:57:21	En_Passant	Didn't know there was a Man at Legs in your game
2015-10-29 02:57:38	En_Passant	Or that you gave it abilities
2015-10-29 02:57:57	ScruffyChat	I don't need it
2015-10-29 02:58:43	ScruffyChat	But basically in addition to firing it'd also be able to reach its head down and lay a mine if a bunch of Pikmin are underneath it
2015-10-29 02:59:39	ScruffyChat	But already today I've been thinking of ways the space rover can use the Man-at-legs's moves and more
2015-10-29 03:01:07	ScruffyChat	Also, I've decided to go with your original suggestion about it
2015-10-29 03:01:17	ScruffyChat	It will come before Edward and DELTA
2015-10-29 03:01:34	ScruffyChat	To begin terraforming potentially habitable regions of PNF-404
2015-10-29 03:02:42	ScruffyChat	When Edward crashes, he lands in the big lake with the island, and swims to the island's shore
2015-10-29 03:03:29	ScruffyChat	He's either overpowered or powerless to stop the rover, which is programmed to use resources to level ground and build preliminary structures, like a landing site
2015-10-29 03:04:09	ScruffyChat	So the rover starts using the big tree to build stuff, and Onions attack it so it defends itself from the Onions
2015-10-29 03:05:38	En_Passant	How would Onions attacking it work?
2015-10-29 03:05:47	En_Passant	And would that still be going on when they reach the tree?
2015-10-29 03:05:59	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure of either of those
2015-10-29 03:06:23	ScruffyChat	The Onions could either physically lunge at the rover or breed wild Pikmin to attack it
2015-10-29 03:06:31	ScruffyChat	But neither would be very effective
2015-10-29 03:07:23	En_Passant	If it is still going on, I'm guessing it would stop and the Onions would leave it to Olimar
2015-10-29 03:07:42	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 03:08:51	ScruffyChat	So the area would be a puzzle based both on the terrain and the structures built by the rover
2015-10-29 03:09:00	En_Passant	Interesting
2015-10-29 03:09:04	ScruffyChat	Which would just be platforms, weight systems, things like that
2015-10-29 03:09:23	En_Passant	Yeah, I was typing that the artificial aspect justifies the puzzles
2015-10-29 03:09:40	ScruffyChat	But when they get there, there'd already be a designated landing site built for when other ships land there
2015-10-29 03:10:36	ScruffyChat	And then when you find it and start fighting it, all of its attacks are based on terraforming abilities meant to alter land
2015-10-29 03:11:22	En_Passant	And each Pikmin will have an attack its immune to, I'm guessing
2015-10-29 03:11:25	En_Passant	Part of the tradition
2015-10-29 03:11:35	ScruffyChat	Yes, I can't ignore tradition
2015-10-29 03:11:55	ScruffyChat	For Reds, a flamethrower meant to get rid of obstructive plants
2015-10-29 03:12:09	ScruffyChat	For Yellows, an shock-based defense most likely
2015-10-29 03:12:15	ScruffyChat	For Blues, not sure
2015-10-29 03:12:24	En_Passant	Water to put out the fires it's starting

2015-10-29 03:12:36	ScruffyChat	Yes!
2015-10-29 03:12:38	ScruffyChat	That's perfect
2015-10-29 03:12:52	En_Passant	Water has a lot of uses, actually
2015-10-29 03:13:15	En_Passant	It's used in concrete, can cool the robot or other things it's building, among others
2015-10-29 03:13:26	ScruffyChat	That's true
2015-10-29 03:13:56	ScruffyChat	Perhaps it can build concrete obstacles that have to be destroyed by Rock or Lichen Pikmin
2015-10-29 03:14:38	ScruffyChat	Whites, it has a fan that I think would emit air from Koppai/Hocotate, that Pikmin can't breathe
2015-10-29 03:14:50	ScruffyChat	It would be colored to notify you, of course
2015-10-29 03:15:48	ScruffyChat	In a larger-scale process of making PNF-404 breathable for them
2015-10-29 03:15:58	ScruffyChat	(them=Hocotatians
2015-10-29 03:17:02	ScruffyChat	And then I thought for Lichens, it would dispatch these little robotic drill bits that whir around the map like tops
2015-10-29 03:17:44	ScruffyChat	And when it gives a signal, the drills dig into the ground until oil starts welling up from the holes
2015-10-29 03:17:53	ScruffyChat	Which would be pollutive to other Pikmin types
2015-10-29 03:18:11	ScruffyChat	But it still comes from the rover's attempt to find resources
2015-10-29 03:18:46	ScruffyChat	And obviously it could briefly hover so Wingeds could come in handy
2015-10-29 03:18:57	ScruffyChat	But I don't know how to include Purples or Mushrooms

2015-10-29 04:08:26	En_Passant	Sorry, I'm switching between this and cleaning
2015-10-29 04:09:19	En_Passant	Lichen could be something cold
2015-10-29 04:09:37	En_Passant	Non-water coolant
2015-10-29 04:13:27	En_Passant	Purples and Mushrooms don't necessarily have to have an attack
2015-10-29 04:13:41	En_Passant	They could just be useful like Wingeds in certain situations
2015-10-29 04:14:29	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-29 04:14:48	ScruffyChat	Yeah, Purples didn't do much to the Titan Dweevil
2015-10-29 04:14:54	ScruffyChat	They just helped if they could
2015-10-29 04:15:01	ScruffyChat	Okay, that's good
2015-10-29 04:15:10	ScruffyChat	Almost done updating the story
2015-10-29 04:15:24	ScruffyChat	And then I'll update all the articles that mention it
2015-10-29 04:15:41	ScruffyChat	I've gotta say, I'm really happy with how this change has turned out
2015-10-29 04:15:48	ScruffyChat	Thank you for all your help with it!
2015-10-29 04:16:17	En_Passant	Sorry for my inactivity
2015-10-29 04:16:33	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-10-29 04:18:09	En_Passant	Oh yeah, I decided on a name for the Beebs
2015-10-29 04:18:22	En_Passant	I'm pretty sure we were overthinking things
2015-10-29 04:18:50	En_Passant	Most enemy names are a combination of what they do and what animal they're based off of
2015-10-29 04:19:39	En_Passant	I decided to go with Roylant
2015-10-29 04:20:14	En_Passant	There's the Lowly Rolyant, the Bombardier Rolyant, and the Ballistic Rolyant (King Beeb)
2015-10-29 04:20:34	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2015-10-29 04:20:35	En_Passant	Their scientific names are what signify the connection
2015-10-29 04:20:57	En_Passant	The genus is just Beeb
2015-10-29 04:21:21	En_Passant	The Ballistic Rolyant's species name is regalis
2015-10-29 04:22:15	ScruffyChat	Aha, that's clever
2015-10-29 04:22:42	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing their look is going to change then, perhaps they'll look more like ants?
2015-10-29 04:23:03	En_Passant	Well, I certainly can't have them look like spheres
2015-10-29 04:23:08	En_Passant	That's ugly
2015-10-29 04:23:13	En_Passant	And unrealistic
2015-10-29 04:23:29	En_Passant	They'll be a hybrid
2015-10-29 04:23:37	En_Passant	Roly-poly body shape and ant features
2015-10-29 04:24:12	ScruffyChat	Ah, cool
2015-10-29 04:24:22	ScruffyChat	Two of my favorite insects, really
2015-10-29 04:24:48	En_Passant	heh
2015-10-29 04:25:12	ScruffyChat	And that means they can be pretty universal
2015-10-29 04:25:16	ScruffyChat	If you want them to be
2015-10-29 04:25:47	En_Passant	They probably should
2015-10-29 04:27:13	En_Passant	Most of my enemies are region-locked
2015-10-29 04:27:23	En_Passant	Except for Massive Plains ones which usually reappear in Verdant Forest
2015-10-29 04:27:39	ScruffyChat	Ah
2015-10-29 04:27:40	En_Passant	I've been trying to fix that
2015-10-29 04:27:50	En_Passant	Guess it doesn't mean much to you when I don't have it posted
2015-10-29 04:28:41	ScruffyChat	No no I feel privileged to have this leaked information
2015-10-29 04:28:53	ScruffyChat	Have you decided on the Rolyant's attack?
2015-10-29 04:29:04	En_Passant	Bombardiers act the same
2015-10-29 04:29:13	En_Passant	Gotta have a Volatile Dweevil replacement
2015-10-29 04:29:17	ScruffyChat	Yep
2015-10-29 04:29:43	En_Passant	I liked how P2 gave explosives to the enemy
2015-10-29 04:30:00	ScruffyChat	Yeah, and entirely not to you
2015-10-29 04:30:11	ScruffyChat	well, not entirely, but mostly
2015-10-29 04:30:26	En_Passant	Hostile Territory doesn't really count
2015-10-29 04:30:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-10-29 04:31:08	En_Passant	Lowly Rolyants are harmless
2015-10-29 04:31:16	En_Passant	They're too small to crush a Pikmin, only knocking them over
2015-10-29 04:31:38	En_Passant	But they also serve as enemy Pikmin, picking up objects and taking them back to their hole
2015-10-29 04:31:53	En_Passant	I'm not too sure about that trait, though, because Breadbugs also appear
2015-10-29 04:32:17	En_Passant	Plus, it's the beginning of the game
2015-10-29 04:32:22	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-29 04:33:02	ScruffyChat	How small did you imagine they'd be?
2015-10-29 04:33:28	En_Passant	Slightly smaller than a Pikmin
2015-10-29 04:33:32	En_Passant	Ants are tiny
2015-10-29 04:33:37	ScruffyChat	True
2015-10-29 04:33:51	ScruffyChat	I just got the idea that, after being defeated, they'd curl up into a ball
2015-10-29 04:33:55	ScruffyChat	Or even before
2015-10-29 04:34:02	ScruffyChat	And Pikmin could carry them like bomb-rocks
2015-10-29 04:34:02	En_Passant	They do that to move around
2015-10-29 04:34:14	ScruffyChat	But I don't know what purpose that would serve
2015-10-29 04:34:23	ScruffyChat	It was just a spur-of-the-moment image
2015-10-29 04:36:30	ScruffyChat	Or perhaps a group of Lowly Rolyants could kidnap a Pikmin
2015-10-29 04:36:42	ScruffyChat	and take it to their nest
2015-10-29 04:36:57	ScruffyChat	And that would set them apart from Breadbugs
2015-10-29 04:37:18	ScruffyChat	Although they'd become more similar to Hermit Crawmads
2015-10-29 04:37:39	En_Passant	Crawmads eat them as soon as they hide
2015-10-29 04:37:50	En_Passant	... so do Breadbugs, though
2015-10-29 04:38:50	En_Passant	I'd like Rolyants not to do that because they appear at the beginning
