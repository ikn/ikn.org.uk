2014-04-11 21:47:38	Spark	neither worked
2014-04-11 21:47:52	@Espyo	same error?
2014-04-11 21:48:02	Spark	yea
2014-04-11 21:48:14	@Espyo	but you did remove the =true in the .cpp, right?
2014-04-11 21:48:28	Spark	oh, no i didnt
2014-04-11 21:48:39	@Espyo	yeah, you have to
2014-04-11 21:49:15	Spark	thats weird but it worked
2014-04-11 21:49:17	Spark	thanks
2014-04-11 21:49:50	@Espyo	np
2014-04-11 21:49:56	@Espyo	all right, no drop in framerate this time
2014-04-11 21:50:09	@Espyo	I'll add the other Linux-like things and push it
2014-04-11 21:51:56	@J	[21:38:56] @Espyo J: is your machine 64-bit?
2014-04-11 21:51:56	@J	yeah
2014-04-11 21:52:17	@Espyo	ok, so that's not why your machine takes millions of tries to find a valid spot
2014-04-11 21:52:32	@Espyo	maybe mine also takes millions, but it's incredibly faster... somehow
2014-04-11 21:53:33	@J	hmm
2014-04-11 21:53:45	@J	well, that was 36M
2014-04-11 21:53:46	Testyo	36 m = 39.3696 yd / 118.109 ft / 1894.74 Olimar-heights / 5999.98 TRY-heights
2014-04-11 21:54:07	@Espyo	 40 yards of tries... ouch
2014-04-11 21:54:08	Testyo	40 yards = 36.576 m
2014-04-11 21:54:09	@Espyo	how even
2014-04-11 21:54:55	@J	maybe a slower rand() implementation?
2014-04-11 21:55:02	@J	you're using a different compiler, after all
2014-04-11 21:55:05	@Espyo	maybe
2014-04-11 21:55:06	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-11 21:55:53	@J	http://sprunge.us/FYPf
2014-04-11 21:56:55	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-04-11 22:05:55	@J	did a quick test, and rand() seems to manage about 130M calls per second
2014-04-11 22:05:56	Testyo	130 m = 142.168 yd / 426.504 ft / 6842.11 Olimar-heights / 21666.6 TRY-heights
2014-04-11 22:07:09	@Espyo	hm
2014-04-11 22:07:29	@Espyo	also I think I found the problem with what I had, regarding the folder lister returning a weird path to you
2014-04-11 22:07:37	@Espyo	I made it so it always returns just the filename, not the fullpath
2014-04-11 22:07:54	@Espyo	and I do this by finding the last backslash or forward slash, and only grabbing what's in front of that
2014-04-11 22:08:17	@Espyo	the problem is that finding the last backslash is easy
2014-04-11 22:08:37	@Espyo	but when it finds the last forward slash, it decides whether it's in front of the last backwards slash
2014-04-11 22:08:47	@Espyo	(some paths can have both back and forward slashes)
2014-04-11 22:09:05	@Espyo	the problem is, when I was comparing if the position of the forward slash was greater than the position of the backslash
2014-04-11 22:09:11	@Espyo	I forgot to take into account the "not found" value
2014-04-11 22:09:27	@Espyo	which is worth several billions
2014-04-11 22:09:33	@Espyo	uh, 2^32
2014-04-11 22:09:48	@J	what?
2014-04-11 22:10:02	@J	what do you mean, the not found value is worth several billions?
2014-04-11 22:10:07	@Espyo	string::npos
2014-04-11 22:10:10	@Espyo	it's a reserved value
2014-04-11 22:10:24	@Espyo	there has to be SOME value that represents a "not found" position
2014-04-11 22:10:32	@Espyo	when you do my_string.find("abc")
2014-04-11 22:10:38	@Espyo	if "abc" doesn't exist, it returns that
2014-04-11 22:10:41	@J	oh
2014-04-11 22:10:46	@Espyo	I know what you're thinking: why not return -1 like JS?
2014-04-11 22:10:49	@Espyo	simple: it's unsigned
2014-04-11 22:10:50	@J	why not NULL?
2014-04-11 22:10:55	@J	uh, wait
2014-04-11 22:10:57	@J	never mind
2014-04-11 22:10:57	@Espyo	NULL is 0
2014-04-11 22:11:11	@J	yeah, I was thinking pointers for some reason
2014-04-11 22:11:25	@J	anyway
2014-04-11 22:11:29	@Espyo	maybe I should go with what the manual is telling me
2014-04-11 22:11:37	@J	instead of both \ and /, you should just use the system path separator
2014-04-11 22:11:44	@J	should be available to you somehow
2014-04-11 22:11:58	@Espyo	I mean, don't go around saving strings, but instead, use Allegro filesystem functions and variables, everywhere I go
2014-04-11 22:12:03	@Espyo	but I'd have to rewirte a lot, and I don't want to
2014-04-11 22:12:09	@Espyo	should it really? this is windows, remember
2014-04-11 22:12:15	@J	yes, it should
2014-04-11 22:12:32	@J	...I would hope
2014-04-11 22:12:35	@Espyo	the problem is, like I said, a path can have both
2014-04-11 22:12:42	@Espyo	I've seen a path have \ and /
2014-04-11 22:12:52	@Espyo	on windows, I mean
2014-04-11 22:13:57	@J	paths can't have / on Windows filesystems, I thought
2014-04-11 22:14:13	@Espyo	they can
2014-04-11 22:14:15	@J	if they look like they do, that's just a library using a different convention and converting it
2014-04-11 22:14:17	@Espyo	it allows both
2014-04-11 22:14:22	@J	hmm
2014-04-11 22:15:46	@J	no
2014-04-11 22:16:08	@J	lots of Windows stuff supports /, even builtin tools
2014-04-11 22:16:17	@J	but whatever tool you use should always give the same one
2014-04-11 22:16:39	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/yup.png
2014-04-11 22:16:57	@Espyo	it should, but instead of checking the system's separator, I just search both \ and /
2014-04-11 22:17:03	@Espyo	plus I just tested, and it works with both
2014-04-11 22:17:07	@Espyo	so stuff shouldn't break in Linux now
2014-04-11 22:17:34	@J	that's not something giving you path separators, it's something interpreting both \ and / as separators, which is very different
2014-04-11 22:17:39	@Espyo	also I actually fixed the deleter not being inside the while loop
2014-04-11 22:17:44	@J	any tool that gives you separators should always use the same one
2014-04-11 22:17:47	@Espyo	hm, true
2014-04-11 22:17:48	@J	just look at the documentation
2014-04-11 22:17:53	@J	if it doesn't, it's wrong in all the way
2014-04-11 22:17:54	@J	s
2014-04-11 22:18:01	@Espyo	yeah, I know what you mean
2014-04-11 22:18:12	@Espyo	but right now, I won't over-complicate it unless I have to
2014-04-11 22:18:12	@J	you should also consider the fact that Linux filenames can contain \
2014-04-11 22:18:20	@Espyo	uh, you never —
2014-04-11 22:18:21	@Espyo	..................
2014-04-11 22:18:22	@J	not that they will, if you want your game to be portable
2014-04-11 22:18:34	@Espyo	what about folders?
2014-04-11 22:18:44	@J	a folder is a file
2014-04-11 22:18:49	@Espyo	right
2014-04-11 22:18:56	@J	a filename can contain any byte except null and /
2014-04-11 22:19:07	@J	even new lines
2014-04-11 22:19:08	@Espyo	no reserved characters?
2014-04-11 22:19:14	@Espyo	like the trillions windows has?
2014-04-11 22:19:26	@J	there are 3 reserved names: '', '.' and '..
2014-04-11 22:19:27	@J	'
2014-04-11 22:19:36	@Espyo	ah, at least thos
2014-04-11 22:19:37	@Espyo	*those
2014-04-11 22:19:56	@Espyo	I only see two there
2014-04-11 22:19:59	@Espyo	.
2014-04-11 22:20:00	@Espyo	..
2014-04-11 22:20:04	@J	'see'?
2014-04-11 22:20:13	@Espyo	wait
2014-04-11 22:20:18	@Espyo	you mean a 0-length name is a reserved name?
2014-04-11 22:20:29	@J	in that you can't create a file with an empty name
2014-04-11 22:20:34	@Espyo	ah, haha
2014-04-11 22:20:35	@Espyo	I get it now
2014-04-11 22:20:45	@Espyo	I was having a hard time /seeing/ those tiny apostrophes
2014-04-11 22:20:51	@Espyo	...anyway...
2014-04-11 22:20:58	@Espyo	I'll just hope nobody has crazy filenames
2014-04-11 22:21:18	@J	if they do, you won't even be able to extract the archive on Windows
2014-04-11 22:21:31	@Espyo	very true
2014-04-11 22:21:36	@J	...uh, or maybe you actually can sometimes
2014-04-11 22:21:45	@Espyo	but I meant more the players, not so much the game makers
2014-04-11 22:21:46	@J	it messes things up pretty badly
2014-04-11 22:21:52	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-11 22:21:59	@Espyo	I've seen filenames with invalid characters before
2014-04-11 22:22:02	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	.
2014-04-11 22:22:04	@Espyo	don't think anything broke, though...
2014-04-11 22:22:10	@Espyo	I think I posted a screenie here as well
2014-04-11 22:22:11	@J	because NTFS supports it, but not Windows
2014-04-11 22:22:11	@Espyo	hey hipo
2014-04-11 22:22:12	@J	IAMAHIPO_ocolor: hi
2014-04-11 22:22:15	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	hey
2014-04-11 22:22:15	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-11 22:22:27	@Espyo	anyway, if they do have an invalid character and something goes wrong, I'll point them to Error_log.txt
2014-04-11 22:22:34	@Espyo	and it'll say it can't find bla bla bla
2014-04-11 22:22:39	@Espyo	and I'll instantly tell them: stop being fancy
2014-04-11 22:22:50	@Espyo	because c'mon, if I have to worry about fancy filenames, I'm never getting out of here
2014-04-11 22:22:52	@J	yeah, once you fix stuff so it errors instead of segfaulting
2014-04-11 22:23:02	@Espyo	did already
2014-04-11 22:23:03	@Espyo	...ish
2014-04-11 22:23:04	@Espyo	...no
2014-04-11 22:23:15	@Espyo	yeah, why /does/ it segfault?
2014-04-11 22:23:20	@Espyo	I think I have error handlers for everything
2014-04-11 22:23:25	@Espyo	oh, you know what, must be my debugging code
2014-04-11 22:23:47	@Espyo	I have code that, for instance, sets the first enemy type's animations to the Cloaking Burrow-nit's
2014-04-11 22:24:01	@Espyo	because the CBN animations aren't in the game data folder yet, they're just test-like
2014-04-11 22:24:12	@Espyo	and I don't check if the vector of enemy types has any size, I just assume because testing
2014-04-11 22:24:20	@Espyo	so stuff like that is probably it segfaults
2014-04-11 22:24:33	@Espyo	but yeah, I meant I now make it output errors on the file as soon as they happen
2014-04-11 22:24:46	@Espyo	anyway, you never replied: do you still get the fog of war effect when you zoom out?
2014-04-11 22:24:51	@Espyo	(did you reply?)
2014-04-11 22:28:33	@J	I remember replying
2014-04-11 22:28:36	@J	a few days ago, you mean?
2014-04-11 22:28:38	@J	yes, I do
2014-04-11 22:29:45	@Espyo	nuts
2014-04-11 22:29:47	@J	hmm, can't even find it in my logs
2014-04-11 22:30:01	@Espyo	I don't think I've ever called it that
2014-04-11 22:30:38	@Espyo	I really can't think of anything
2014-04-11 22:30:43	@Espyo	well, I'll just push what I have here
2014-04-11 22:30:48	@Espyo	see if it runs ok in Linux, please
2014-04-11 22:38:57	@J	number of errors is around about a million
2014-04-11 22:39:19	@J	http://sprunge.us/FBRZ

2014-04-11 22:50:38	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	hey j what have you been up to?
2014-04-11 22:51:26	@J	just...things and stuff
2014-04-11 22:51:31	@J	wait, when did we last speak?
2014-04-11 22:51:42	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	like two years ago
2014-04-11 22:51:46	@J	probably before I started working
2014-04-11 22:51:51	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	maybe a year
2014-04-11 22:51:52	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	yeah
2014-04-11 22:51:53	@J	yeah, I have a programming job
2014-04-11 22:52:02	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	what do you do?
2014-04-11 22:52:30	@J	struggling not to say 'programming'
2014-04-11 22:52:44	@J	web backend-type stuff
2014-04-11 22:52:46	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	well who do you work for
2014-04-11 22:52:51	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	from home?
2014-04-11 22:52:55	@J	no
2014-04-11 22:53:03	@J	a company which was recently bought by HP
2014-04-11 22:53:17	@J	so I technically work for HP now
2014-04-11 22:53:18	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	does it feel weird to be an adult
2014-04-11 22:53:23	@J	heh
2014-04-11 22:53:37	@J	I guess it's not very different
2014-04-11 22:53:50	@J	I mean, I already lived away from home
2014-04-11 22:53:56	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	yeah
2014-04-11 22:54:01	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	you drive now?
2014-04-11 22:54:09	@J	hmm, no
2014-04-11 22:54:13	@J	just too lazy, I guess
2014-04-11 22:54:22	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	public transit ?
2014-04-11 22:54:43	@J	yes, but it's not like I've really had to do anything other than walking
2014-04-11 22:54:56	@J	many people here cycle, but I'm too lazy for that too
2014-04-11 22:55:06	@J	I'll probably get a bike at some point, I expect
2014-04-11 22:55:09	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	cycling is like
2014-04-11 22:55:21	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	the opitome of being lazy
2014-04-11 22:55:37	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	epitome* 
2014-04-11 22:55:50	@J	I don't mean actually doing it, I mean maintenance and actually buying a bike and having to know where I'll lock it up, and insurance, and all that stuff
2014-04-11 22:55:51	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	you expend so little energy for work
2014-04-11 22:55:59	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	insurance for a bike?
2014-04-11 22:56:14	@J	...maybe?  It's not like I've looked into it
2014-04-11 22:56:24	@J	yeah, I don't see why not - they get stolen
2014-04-11 22:56:30	@J	and can be expensive
2014-04-11 22:56:38	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	well they cost like $50
2014-04-11 22:56:38	Testyo	$ 50 = 36.86 € / £ 31.525 
2014-04-11 22:56:46	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	for a decent old road bike
2014-04-11 22:56:54	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	anyways
2014-04-11 22:56:59	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	you still doing games?
2014-04-11 22:57:37	@J	kind of
2014-04-11 22:57:47	@J	not as much as I would like, but I still want to
2014-04-11 22:57:59	@J	I went to a local indie meetup a few times
2014-04-11 22:58:30	@J	Stephen Lavelle and Terry Cavanagh moved away from here fairly recently
2014-04-11 22:58:46	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	who are they
2014-04-11 22:59:02	@J	Terry Cavanagh made VVVVVV and Super Hexagon and lots of other stuff
2014-04-11 22:59:37	@J	Stephen Lavelle made English Country Tune
2014-04-11 23:00:21	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	have you watched indie game the movie?
2014-04-11 23:00:43	@J	yeah, a while back
2014-04-11 23:01:20	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	i still think you should polish up world view of a slime and release it on new grounds or something
2014-04-11 23:01:30	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	its a really fun core game mechanic
2014-04-11 23:01:39	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	and original
2014-04-11 23:02:22	@J	Newgrounds is for Flash games
2014-04-11 23:02:46	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	well whatever game site that would accept it
2014-04-11 23:03:00	@J	yeah, I get what you're saying
2014-04-11 23:03:03	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	whichevevr*
2014-04-11 23:03:21	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	have you tried spelunky?
2014-04-11 23:03:38	@J	no, but it's on the list of games I'll probably play some day
2014-04-11 23:03:53	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	you still dont play many games?
2014-04-11 23:04:19	@J	it's more like I'm just a few years behind
2014-04-11 23:05:54	@Espyo	there's a free version of Spelunky
2014-04-11 23:06:20	@J	meh, if I played it I'd buy it anyway

2014-04-11 23:40:30	@Espyo	I think half of the mess is me not specifying what a string is
2014-04-11 23:40:37	@Espyo	and it giving over 100 errors that don't explain a thing
2014-04-11 23:40:45	@Espyo	nope
2014-04-11 23:42:18	@J	I can give gcc output too in case it's more useful
2014-04-11 23:42:46	@Espyo	not really
2014-04-11 23:42:52	@Espyo	clang's is... bloated
2014-04-11 23:42:54	@Espyo	but... useful
2014-04-11 23:43:17	@Espyo	wait, I think I got it
2014-04-11 23:43:29	@Espyo	I mean, I know what Clang's problem is
2014-04-11 23:44:14	@Espyo	in retrospect, I think I could've just moved animation_set to the bottom
2014-04-11 23:44:22	@Espyo	but meh, I split the .h and .cpp now
2014-04-11 23:44:28	@Espyo	should help for the future anyway, maybe
2014-04-11 23:44:37	@Espyo	either way, Clang can't complain now
2014-04-11 23:44:40	@Espyo	let's see, what else...
2014-04-11 23:45:00	@Espyo	I can barely read the rest

2014-04-11 23:54:10	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	what is this project youre working on

2014-04-11 23:55:15	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	of

2014-04-11 23:56:24	@J	by Espyo, that is
2014-04-11 23:57:00	@Espyo	still segfaulting...?
2014-04-11 23:57:12	@J	there's one in do_logic()
2014-04-11 23:58:49	@J	also, this line is 200 characters long
2014-04-11 23:58:52	@J	I'm ashamed
2014-04-11 23:59:01	@J	(of you)
2014-04-11 23:59:38	@Espyo	I don't segment them as much as I do
2014-04-11 23:59:51	@Espyo	now now, don't look at me like this is one of my crazy programming standards
2014-04-11 23:59:59	@Espyo	a) my standards are excellent
2014-04-12 00:00:03	@Espyo	b) I'm just lazy to split lines
2014-04-12 00:00:08	@J	[23:59:38] @Espyo I don't segment them as much as I do
2014-04-12 00:00:11	@Espyo	do_logic is massive, btw
2014-04-12 00:00:11	@J	what does this even mean
2014-04-12 00:00:14	@J	I know
2014-04-12 00:00:16	@Espyo	*I should
2014-04-12 00:00:20	@J	also it's a header file
2014-04-12 00:00:27	@J	which means it won't recompile properly
2014-04-12 00:00:33	@Espyo	how so?
2014-04-12 00:00:42	@Espyo	(also I'm Skyping, so that explains my weirdglish)
2014-04-12 00:00:49	@J	because the objects built correspond to cpp files
2014-04-12 00:01:00	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-04-12 00:01:16	@J	they only get rebuilt when the corresponding cpp file changes
2014-04-12 00:01:23	@Espyo	it's just that having a .h that just contains "void do_logic()" and having a .cpp with the function is pretty crap
2014-04-12 00:01:35	@Espyo	works fine in VS though
2014-04-12 00:01:53	@J	hmm, well, I don't think it should
2014-04-12 00:02:49	@J	okay, this function
2014-04-12 00:02:51	@J	wow
2014-04-12 00:10:16	@Espyo	don't scare me
2014-04-12 00:11:24	@J	hitbox_instance* closest_hitbox = get_closest_hitbox(pik_ptr->x, pik_ptr->y, mob_ptr);
2014-04-12 00:11:39	@J	the 'wow' was at its crazy length and number of branches
2014-04-12 00:11:47	@J	so yeah, that line segfaults
2014-04-12 00:11:51	@J	for the second mob
2014-04-12 00:12:03	@J	of 76
2014-04-12 00:12:35	@Espyo	...
2014-04-12 00:12:42	@Espyo	the second mob would be a pikmin
2014-04-12 00:13:07	@Espyo	wait
2014-04-12 00:13:15	@Espyo	the second mob for that Pikmin?
2014-04-12 00:13:31	@J	yeah
2014-04-12 00:13:42	@J	first Pikmin
2014-04-12 00:15:45	@Espyo	and it crashes in that line yes?
2014-04-12 00:15:51	@J	caused by f->hitbox_instances.size()
2014-04-12 00:15:57	@Espyo	and not inside the function that's in that—
2014-04-12 00:16:01	@Espyo	it's not opening the file, probably
2014-04-12 00:16:11	@Espyo	f must be NULL
2014-04-12 00:16:28	@J	which file?
2014-04-12 00:17:00	@Espyo	Test.txt
2014-04-12 00:17:01	@Espyo	root
2014-04-12 00:18:17	@Espyo	...it shouldn't crash, though
2014-04-12 00:18:28	@J	where is it trying to load it?
2014-04-12 00:18:34	@Espyo	the root of the game
2014-04-12 00:18:43	@Espyo	but yeah, I tried removing the file
2014-04-12 00:18:52	@Espyo	worst that can happen is the CBN not appearing
2014-04-12 00:18:56	@Espyo	the game didn't crash for me
2014-04-12 00:20:37	@Espyo	mob_event.cpp, line 80
2014-04-12 00:20:47	@Espyo	it's the only place where an animation instance is created
2014-04-12 00:21:00	@Espyo	and the only place where the anim member is set, in an animation instance
2014-04-12 00:21:08	@Espyo	so the only place in which this can be null
2014-04-12 00:21:21	@Espyo	which is one of the only two ways that f can be null, and cause the segfault
2014-04-12 00:22:56	@Espyo	simpler: add a cout after line 778
2014-04-12 00:23:02	@Espyo	if(!f) cout << "NOPE"
2014-04-12 00:23:17	@Espyo	and if you get a nope, well...
2014-04-12 00:24:53	@J	yeah, anim is falsy in get_frame()
2014-04-12 00:25:04	@J	I guess that means null
2014-04-12 00:25:43	@Espyo	...pfft, falsy?
2014-04-12 00:26:23	@Espyo	well, it can only return null things if it really can't read the animation
2014-04-12 00:26:31	@Espyo	tell you what, what if you start the engine with an argument?
2014-04-12 00:26:34	@Espyo	any argument
2014-04-12 00:26:38	@Espyo	this makes the animation editor load
2014-04-12 00:26:58	@Espyo	the main menu straight away tells you the number of animations, frames and hitboxes in Test.txt, the animation file for the CBN
2014-04-12 00:27:10	@Espyo	if it says 0 everywhere... must be a problem with file loading
2014-04-12 00:27:29	@Espyo	although it's using the exact same method as the options file...

2014-04-12 00:34:13	@J	okay, I messed something up...
2014-04-12 00:35:22	@Espyo	yeah, second
2014-04-12 00:35:37	@Espyo	an iterator of a map has a first and a second member
2014-04-12 00:35:44	@Espyo	better known as key and value
2014-04-12 00:35:48	@Espyo	why didn't they call them that?
2014-04-12 00:35:51	@Espyo	...very good question
2014-04-12 00:36:11	@J	I get 8 there
2014-04-12 00:36:24	@Espyo	gaaaah
2014-04-12 00:37:30	@Espyo	but wait, you only sigsev if you get a Pikmin close to the CBN, right?
2014-04-12 00:37:56	@J	wha?
2014-04-12 00:38:01	@J	it segfaults on startup

2014-04-12 00:38:05	@Espyo	how!?
2014-04-12 00:38:15	@J	the magic of C++
2014-04-12 00:38:25	@Espyo	get_closest_hitbox is only called if a Pikmin is within range of the CBN
2014-04-12 00:38:32	@Espyo	within "task" range
2014-04-12 00:38:38	@J	hmm, okay
2014-04-12 00:38:50	@Espyo	so how in the world...
2014-04-12 00:38:56	@J	how do I check what type a mob is?
2014-04-12 00:39:02	@J	or something about it - co-ordinates, etc.
2014-04-12 00:39:16	@Espyo	mob.x, mob.y are the coordinates
2014-04-12 00:39:37	@Espyo	for the type... you'd have to do something like if(typeid(*mob_ptr) == typeid(enemy))
2014-04-12 00:39:50	@Espyo	mob_ptr being a pointer to the mob, and enemy being enemy, pikmin, pellet, ...
2014-04-12 00:39:59	@J	it's at (0, 0)
2014-04-12 00:40:05	@Espyo	the CBN?
2014-04-12 00:40:10	@J	whatever this mob is
2014-04-12 00:40:21	@Espyo	must be Olimar

2014-04-12 00:40:36	@Espyo	Game_data/Areas/test.txt
2014-04-12 00:40:39	@Espyo	yeah, that's Olimar
2014-04-12 00:41:24	@Espyo	...great, if I install VBox now, it'll throw the Skype call down
2014-04-12 00:41:34	@Espyo	might as well download a distro during this time
2014-04-12 00:41:42	@Espyo	...any distro'd work, right?
2014-04-12 00:41:43	@J	why is it saying Pikmin should attack Olimar?
2014-04-12 00:41:51	@J	...who knows
2014-04-12 00:41:52	@Espyo	...wha
2014-04-12 00:41:54	@J	you need Allegro 5
2014-04-12 00:41:59	@J	(right?)
2014-04-12 00:42:09	@Espyo	that I do, but you got your version of Allegro 5 from...
2014-04-12 00:42:14	@Espyo	err, from that command line thing
2014-04-12 00:42:19	@Espyo	uh, tired to remember it
2014-04-12 00:42:24	@Espyo	apt-install get
2014-04-12 00:42:35	@Espyo	and yeah, nothing nowhere tells Pikmin to attack Olimar
2014-04-12 00:42:39	@J	yeah, but other distros might ship old versions
2014-04-12 00:42:51	@J	you used Ubuntu before, looks like 13.04 or later has 5
2014-04-12 00:43:18	@Espyo	this isn't my dream today, where I dreamed I was playing Pikmin 3, and 2000+ Pikmin were carrying Olimar (what), and they tripped on an edge, took fall damage (what), and 1700 of them died
2014-04-12 00:43:19	@J	well, should_attack() returns true for this mob at (0, 0)
2014-04-12 00:43:27	@Espyo	uh
2014-04-12 00:43:31	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2014-04-12 00:43:43	@Espyo	oh, uh
2014-04-12 00:43:46	@Espyo	that does sound right
2014-04-12 00:43:51	@Espyo	I think Olimar's "team" might be undefined
2014-04-12 00:44:05	@Espyo	in fact, I don't even know how should_attack() is even /working/
2014-04-12 00:44:13	@Espyo	seeing as I don't remember setting "teams" anywhere
2014-04-12 00:44:51	@Espyo	but yeah, aren't the Allegro 5 libraries downloaded from whatever package servers the distro has?
2014-04-12 00:44:59	@Espyo	pretty sure most distros would share servers
2014-04-12 00:45:32	@J	so you only load an animation for a single mob?
2014-04-12 00:45:43	@J	and if anything else tries to animate it'll crash?
2014-04-12 00:45:51	@J	[00:44:59] @Espyo pretty sure most distros would share servers
2014-04-12 00:45:54	@J	very much not true
2014-04-12 00:46:00	@Espyo	nothing else animates
2014-04-12 00:46:05	@Espyo	really? huh
2014-04-12 00:46:08	@J	okay
2014-04-12 00:46:32	@J	so, many are based on other distros, which often means they share packages
2014-04-12 00:46:41	@Espyo	right
2014-04-12 00:46:44	@J	but they might also have their own repositories on top of the parent distro
2014-04-12 00:47:04	@J	and there are still many different package formats
2014-04-12 00:47:06	@Espyo	but shouldn't it be possible to fetch packages from repositories that "belong" to other distros?
2014-04-12 00:47:11	@Espyo	...
2014-04-12 00:47:52	@J	and you can't just install a random package, even if it's in the right format, because it will have versioned dependencies
2014-04-12 00:48:16	@Espyo	yeah, I know that much, but...
2014-04-12 00:48:16	@J	on Windows, programs just bundle libraries with them, which is why they're so big
2014-04-12 00:48:21	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-12 00:49:18	@J	also, Pikmin 'should attack' whatever's at (-100, 100)
2014-04-12 00:49:37	@Espyo	the ship
2014-04-12 00:49:51	@Espyo	yeah, pretty sure pretty much nothing has a team set
2014-04-12 00:49:55	@Espyo	so it must default to teamless
2014-04-12 00:50:03	@Espyo	which means it can attack anything and be attacked by anything
2014-04-12 00:50:28	@Espyo	it /shouldn't/ default to 0, because I never set the default value
2014-04-12 00:50:31	@Espyo	= bad thing to do
2014-04-12 00:50:35	@Espyo	garbage values are horrible things
2014-04-12 00:51:45	@J	the Pikmin apparently has no team
2014-04-12 00:51:57	@Espyo	that's also bad
2014-04-12 00:52:09	@J	okay
2014-04-12 00:52:15	@Espyo	yeah, only enemies have their team set
2014-04-12 00:52:17	@J	so VS's compiler is just setting things to 0/
2014-04-12 00:52:18	@J	*?
2014-04-12 00:52:21	@Espyo	guess that's enough for should_attack() to work
2014-04-12 00:52:28	@Espyo	uhhhhh... it should, actually
2014-04-12 00:52:41	@Espyo	you know, it really should
2014-04-12 00:52:43	@Espyo	what if this explains everything
2014-04-12 00:52:59	@J	except that if the Pikmin has no team, it attacks everything
2014-04-12 00:53:02	@J	so it attacks captains
2014-04-12 00:53:10	@J	which requires them to have hitboxes
2014-04-12 00:53:14	@J	which requires them to have animations
2014-04-12 00:53:15	@Espyo	yes, yes...
2014-04-12 00:53:35	@Espyo	sigsev
2014-04-12 00:53:38	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-04-12 00:53:46	@Espyo	well, "Unhandled exception at 0x010986e9 in Pikmin_fangame_engine.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x00000070."
2014-04-12 00:53:52	@J	where //ToDo removeish.
2014-04-12 00:53:53	@J	nice
2014-04-12 00:53:56	@Espyo	I can't believe how off the wall this solution is
2014-04-12 00:54:07	@J	wait, you made it happen?
2014-04-12 00:54:08	@Espyo	hey, enemies are meant to have the "none" team
2014-04-12 00:54:12	@Espyo	I made it happen
2014-04-12 00:54:17	@J	how?
2014-04-12 00:54:21	@Espyo	forced all mobs to have a "none" team
2014-04-12 00:54:29	@J	where is it set?
2014-04-12 00:54:32	@Espyo	which makes Pikmin attack everything, which... yeah
2014-04-12 00:54:37	@Espyo	I just set it in the constructor of mob
2014-04-12 00:54:42	@Espyo	type = MOB_TYPE_NONE;
2014-04-12 00:55:08	@Espyo	........
2014-04-12 00:55:13	@Espyo	MOB_TYPE_NONE is 0
2014-04-12 00:55:27	@Espyo	maybe this crash is something else?
2014-04-12 00:55:51	@Espyo	nope, it's the same problem
2014-04-12 00:55:53	@Espyo	then...
2014-04-12 00:56:08	@Espyo	oh yeah, second mob
2014-04-12 00:56:35	@Espyo	but...
2014-04-12 00:56:41	@Espyo	wait, AM I setting the team somewhere?
2014-04-12 00:56:49	@J	hmm
2014-04-12 00:57:02	@J	maybe VS initialises to 5 or something
2014-04-12 00:57:09	@Espyo	pfft
2014-04-12 00:57:12	@Espyo	could be, really
2014-04-12 00:57:34	@Espyo	 205
2014-04-12 00:57:40	@Espyo	huh, it's set to garbage values
2014-04-12 00:58:38	@Espyo	ok, I don't really know what determines whether VS zeroes structures out or not
2014-04-12 00:58:44	@Espyo	maybe only pointers...?
2014-04-12 00:58:46	@Espyo	dunno
2014-04-12 01:00:01	@Espyo	all right, this should be enough
2014-04-12 01:00:06	@J	ah, just realised I wasn't building in parallel this whole time
2014-04-12 01:00:29	@Espyo	hmm? multi-threaded?
2014-04-12 01:00:35	@J	yeah, I have garbage too, but it determines that that means no team
2014-04-12 01:00:36	@Espyo	also, this means Clang was zeroing the structures
2014-04-12 01:00:40	@J	nope
2014-04-12 01:02:05	@Espyo	yeah, just had to check if stuff was null in three places, and boom, no more crash
2014-04-12 01:02:21	@Espyo	functions.cpp, 778
2014-04-12 01:02:21	@Espyo	if(!f) return NULL;     
2014-04-12 01:02:37	@Espyo	(after 778)
2014-04-12 01:02:43	@Espyo	logic.h, 397
2014-04-12 01:02:44	@J	...you should still make sure the team is initialised
2014-04-12 01:02:48	@Espyo	if(!closest_hitbox) continue;
2014-04-12 01:03:00	@Espyo	logic.h, 357
2014-04-12 01:03:01	@Espyo	if(!closest_hitbox) continue;
2014-04-12 01:03:06	@Espyo	oh that too
2014-04-12 01:03:21	@Espyo	mob.cpp, 26
2014-04-12 01:03:22	@Espyo	team = MOB_TEAM_NONE;
2014-04-12 01:03:26	@Espyo	that should be enough
2014-04-12 01:03:34	@Espyo	it can't crash now... right?...

2014-04-12 01:05:36	@J	[01:00:29] @Espyo hmm? multi-threaded?
2014-04-12 01:05:40	@J	processes, I think
2014-04-12 01:05:45	@Espyo	or that
2014-04-12 01:06:00	@J	just added -j8 and suddenly 6x faster or so
2014-04-12 01:06:18	@J	okay, it works, and no lag on whistle
2014-04-12 01:06:34	@Espyo	woah
2014-04-12 01:06:38	@Espyo	ah, phew
2014-04-12 01:06:42	@Espyo	can you kill the CBN?
2014-04-12 01:06:50	@J	I like how height and width are separated in options
2014-04-12 01:06:52	@Espyo	should be just like in the Pikmin games, so no notes here
2014-04-12 01:07:02	@Espyo	you can have a super tall window
2014-04-12 01:07:05	@Espyo	game doesn't care
2014-04-12 01:07:31	@Espyo	also hey, it shouldn't matter, but if you edit window_x and window_y to something like 0 and 0, does the window move?
2014-04-12 01:07:49	@Espyo	it matters for PikFan — for some reason it loads the window SEVERAL pixels to the right and bottom of the screen
2014-04-12 01:08:47	@J	not sure what you're talking about, but I mean that the options in the file are not next to each other
2014-04-12 01:09:05	@Espyo	alphabetical
2014-04-12 01:09:18	@J	seems like you fixed that weird issue I had where Pikmin were thrown random distances at exactly 20FPS
2014-04-12 01:09:42	@J	yeah, alphabetical by section
2014-04-12 01:09:46	@J	but sections are kind of random
2014-04-12 01:10:06	@Espyo	dunno what I did, but hurray
2014-04-12 01:10:08	@J	window_x=2147483647                                                             
2014-04-12 01:10:10	@J	what
2014-04-12 01:10:30	@Espyo	https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/al_set_new_window_position To reset to the default behaviour, pass (INT_MAX, INT_MAX).
2014-04-12 01:10:49	@Espyo	hey, not gonna fight fate
2014-04-12 01:10:55	@Espyo	 2147483647, so be it
2014-04-12 01:11:48	@Espyo	but the zoom out glitch still happens, huh
2014-04-12 01:12:05	@Espyo	I think you answer before, but both if you press C and use the mouse wheel, right?
2014-04-12 01:12:27	@J	yes, I killed the Burrow-nit
2014-04-12 01:12:45	@Espyo	good, no crashes
2014-04-12 01:12:47	@Espyo	...right
2014-04-12 01:12:53	@J	yep, it's fine
2014-04-12 01:13:02	@J	also, I was experiencing random segfaults before, but they seem to be gone
2014-04-12 01:13:09	@J	might've been related to the mob type stuff
2014-04-12 01:13:12	@J	team
2014-04-12 01:13:20	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-12 01:13:29	@Espyo	I should try to search for more uninitialized members
2014-04-12 01:13:33	@J	yes, zoom glitch with both methods
2014-04-12 01:13:48	@Espyo	heck, I wonder why no compiler warns me about them
2014-04-12 01:14:02	@J	little bit sad there's a zoom limit
2014-04-12 01:14:46	@Espyo	const.h line 62
2014-04-12 01:14:53	@J	and movement is still a little off (hold a and d and Olimar moves, probably shouldn't)
2014-04-12 01:14:57	@Espyo	it'll probably underflow past 0
2014-04-12 01:15:10	@Espyo	huh, what do you mean?
2014-04-12 01:15:29	@Espyo	oh, *A* and D
2014-04-12 01:15:38	@Espyo	yeah, I really have to make it better
2014-04-12 01:16:29	@J	zoom level seems to do nothing
2014-04-12 01:16:40	@Espyo	hey, so wait, your Pikmin aren't dying any more, are they?
2014-04-12 01:16:43	@J	wait, did I want min or max?
2014-04-12 01:16:48	@J	no, they're not
2014-04-12 01:16:48	@Espyo	min
2014-04-12 01:16:53	@Espyo	they're constants, they're the limits
2014-04-12 01:16:57	@Espyo	set it to like 0
2014-04-12 01:17:01	@Espyo	oh, HAH!
2014-04-12 01:17:03	@J	I did
2014-04-12 01:17:09	@Espyo	I think the Pikmin were killing each other off
2014-04-12 01:17:14	@Espyo	they were teamless
2014-04-12 01:17:15	@J	nope, looks like I wanted max
2014-04-12 01:17:21	@J	wonderful
2014-04-12 01:17:23	@J	same bug
2014-04-12 01:17:26	@Espyo	and back then, you didn't need hitboxes!
2014-04-12 01:17:30	@Espyo	haha this is great
2014-04-12 01:18:02	@Espyo	controls.cpp, after line 19, add cam_zoom = 0.6;
2014-04-12 01:18:07	@Espyo	then press T in-game
2014-04-12 01:18:11	@Espyo	see if you still get the fade out
2014-04-12 01:18:17	@Espyo	and I better start pointing these results down
2014-04-12 01:18:22	@Espyo	'cause this looks like a bug that's here to stay
2014-04-12 01:18:35	@J	can I pluck?
2014-04-12 01:18:49	@Espyo	cllick
2014-04-12 01:18:51	@Espyo	*click
2014-04-12 01:19:05	@Espyo	and yes, that's also a thing
2014-04-12 01:19:12	@Espyo	yes, also with other leaders in your party
2014-04-12 01:20:25	@J	okay, when Pikmin start attacking something they teleport?
2014-04-12 01:20:37	@Espyo	if you C-stick them, I think they do
2014-04-12 01:21:00	@Espyo	ok, they shouldnt
2014-04-12 01:21:02	@Espyo	*shouldn't
2014-04-12 01:21:26	@J	throwing them
2014-04-12 01:21:33	@J	as they land, they teleport to the enemy
2014-04-12 01:21:37	@J	or move _really_ fast
2014-04-12 01:21:38	@Espyo	something = CBN, right?
2014-04-12 01:22:06	@Espyo	well, if I throw them near the CBN, they move to attack it
2014-04-12 01:22:09	@Espyo	but no faster than normal
2014-04-12 01:22:27	@J	yeah
2014-04-12 01:22:32	@J	hmm
2014-04-12 01:22:47	@Espyo	you're probably throwing a flower Pikmin
2014-04-12 01:22:59	@J	the thing didn't fix camera zooming thing
2014-04-12 01:23:13	@Espyo	pressing T?
2014-04-12 01:23:27	@J	yeah
2014-04-12 01:23:32	@J	looks like they're all leaf to me
2014-04-12 01:23:32	@Espyo	all right
2014-04-12 01:23:34	@J	I'll record it
2014-04-12 01:23:35	@Espyo	*noting*
2014-04-12 01:23:42	@Espyo	you can zoom in to check
2014-04-12 01:23:47	@Espyo	there's only like two flower Pikmin
2014-04-12 01:23:50	@Espyo	a Red and a Yellow
2014-04-12 01:23:58	@Espyo	 /pretty/ sure a Blue should be flower too, but...
2014-04-12 01:23:59	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	 ok so fuck spelunky
2014-04-12 01:24:27	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	whats this engine you're working on
2014-04-12 01:24:49	@Espyo	an engine to make Pikmin fan games
2014-04-12 01:25:06	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	whats it like? 
2014-04-12 01:25:12	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	2d?\
2014-04-12 01:25:17	@Espyo	top-down view, yeah
2014-04-12 01:25:26	@Espyo	you can try it now, there's a playable alpha
2014-04-12 01:25:42	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	linky?
2014-04-12 01:26:06	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Permanent/PFE/PFE%20Alpha%203.zip
2014-04-12 01:26:11	@Espyo	should run straight away
2014-04-12 01:26:24	@Espyo	it's a bit outdated, like, I don't think you can kill the Cloaking Burrow-nit there
2014-04-12 01:26:33	@Espyo	me and J are using a more outdated version, but I haven't made a Windows build out of it
2014-04-12 01:27:06	@J	*up-to-date
2014-04-12 01:27:15	Spark	i need to get a book on opengl
2014-04-12 01:27:19	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	this is really neat
2014-04-12 01:27:34	@Espyo	oops
2014-04-12 01:27:38	@Espyo	thanks
2014-04-12 01:27:47	Spark	then i can make 3d version an everyone will be impressed and ill be cooler than espy =d
2014-04-12 01:27:47	@Espyo	Spark: internet
2014-04-12 01:27:53	@Espyo	you sure would
2014-04-12 01:27:55	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	you are the lead designer?
2014-04-12 01:27:58	@Espyo	given how much harder it is
2014-04-12 01:28:01	@Espyo	right now I'm the lead everything
2014-04-12 01:28:03	@J	oh yeah, shadows look good
2014-04-12 01:28:07	@Espyo	except for J, he's the lead support
2014-04-12 01:28:10	@Espyo	which makes no sense, but he is
2014-04-12 01:28:14	@Espyo	oh, thanks
2014-04-12 01:28:18	@Espyo	incredible how easy it is to make them
2014-04-12 01:28:26	@J	they confused me at first because they were to the side
2014-04-12 01:28:31	@J	then I realised things
2014-04-12 01:29:10	@J	are there actually any decent OpenGL tutorials?
2014-04-12 01:29:17	@J	including books
2014-04-12 01:29:21	@J	for modern OpenGL
2014-04-12 01:29:38	Spark	no
2014-04-12 01:29:48	@Espyo	everything that exists everywhere is for old versions
2014-04-12 01:30:24	@J	I should learn OpenGL too
2014-04-12 01:30:32	Spark	i went on opengl chat and was like "WHY ARE THERE NO DECENT OPENGL TUTORIALS" and he was like "buy this book and this book and this other book and then maybe you'll be able to understand this other book"
2014-04-12 01:30:51	@Espyo	youch
2014-04-12 01:30:55	@Espyo	I'm lucky I learned in college
2014-04-12 01:30:59	@Espyo	and even that's outdated
2014-04-12 01:31:15	@J	yeah, I don't really want to bother with pre-shader stuff
2014-04-12 01:31:16	Spark	im not even in college so i guess id be luckier if i started learning
2014-04-12 01:31:23	Spark	unfortunately thats probably not gonna happen
2014-04-12 01:31:43	@Espyo	right, shaders
2014-04-12 01:31:49	@Espyo	what /exactly/ are they, anyway?
2014-04-12 01:31:53	@Espyo	the idea I have in my head is
2014-04-12 01:31:57	@J	I heard it might make more sense to learn OpenGL ES instead - someone told me it's OpenGL but with all the duplicate ways of doing things removed
2014-04-12 01:32:01	Spark	anyways dude this is really good, the graphics are a bit confusing since everything is monochrome but i can see this being really fun
2014-04-12 01:32:11	@J	monochrome?
2014-04-12 01:32:14	@Espyo	after you render the image, but before flipping the display, you can do stuff to the pixels
2014-04-12 01:32:17	@J	I see lots of colours
2014-04-12 01:32:23	Spark	i mean like
2014-04-12 01:32:31	Spark	the pikmin are solid red/blue/yellow
2014-04-12 01:32:31	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	thats impossible j
2014-04-12 01:32:32	Spark	etc
2014-04-12 01:32:35	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	you're colorblind
2014-04-12 01:32:41	@Espyo	uh, scratch all of that until the "you can do stuff with the pixels"
2014-04-12 01:32:43	@Espyo	he's right there
2014-04-12 01:32:44	@J	hey, that's not what colour-blind means
2014-04-12 01:32:50	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	shhhhh
2014-04-12 01:32:56	@Espyo	thanks
2014-04-12 01:33:00	@Espyo	but... monochrome?
2014-04-12 01:33:01	@J	oh, on the topic - today I learned the Portal portal colours are orange and blue
2014-04-12 01:33:03	@Espyo	I think you just meant solid
2014-04-12 01:33:08	@J	not orange and purple, as I've always thought
2014-04-12 01:33:26	@Espyo	but yeah, they are pretty much rgb 255 0 0, 255 255 0 and 0 0 255
2014-04-12 01:33:27	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	hahahahahaha
2014-04-12 01:33:34	@Espyo	couldn't really be bothered to make more betterer colors
2014-04-12 01:33:37	Spark	mono means one, and chrome means color, right?
2014-04-12 01:33:40	@J	maybe you could try thick dark outlines on everything like we did with the icons
2014-04-12 01:33:40	@Espyo	J: don't play co-op
2014-04-12 01:33:43	@J	might look really nice
2014-04-12 01:33:46	@J	oh, I have
2014-04-12 01:33:48	@Espyo	.............you're right
2014-04-12 01:33:49	@Espyo	great Scott
2014-04-12 01:33:58	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	j you play any coop online games at all>'
2014-04-12 01:33:59	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	?
2014-04-12 01:34:07	@J	I thought the 2-player portals were both blue, apparently one's purple
2014-04-12 01:34:07	@Espyo	I won't try it because I want it to fit the rest of the textures
2014-04-12 01:34:10	@Espyo	like the grass and such
2014-04-12 01:34:11	@J	IAMAHIPO_ocolor: no
2014-04-12 01:34:20	@Espyo	you gotta try TF2
2014-04-12 01:34:50	@J	oh, the videa
2014-04-12 01:34:52	@J	*video
2014-04-12 01:34:57	@J	I uploaded it but forgot to link

2014-04-12 01:35:15	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/teleport.mkv
2014-04-12 01:35:20	@J	...
2014-04-12 01:35:21	Spark	if i were less lazy i would help you make nicer graphics but unfortunately i am not :T
2014-04-12 01:35:27	@Espyo	oooooooohh...
2014-04-12 01:35:29	@Espyo	like /that/
2014-04-12 01:35:34	@Espyo	if they cross the enemy while being thrown
2014-04-12 01:35:47	@J	can you reproduce it?
2014-04-12 01:35:53	@Espyo	easily, yeah
2014-04-12 01:35:57	@Espyo	ok, thanks for letting me now
2014-04-12 01:36:02	@Espyo	I'll take care of that tomorrow
2014-04-12 01:36:06	@Espyo	can't believe I haven't tried that
2014-04-12 01:36:15	@Espyo	I even took some time to make sure everything about throwing and fighting was working
2014-04-12 01:36:39	@Espyo	Spark: thanks, but if you can't, it's fine
2014-04-12 01:36:43	@Espyo	it'll just stay the way they are
2014-04-12 01:36:47	@Espyo	they aren't /that/ bad... right?
2014-04-12 01:36:55	@J	[01:32:14] @Espyo after you render the image, but before flipping the display, you can do stuff to the pixels
2014-04-12 01:37:09	@J	I think it happens before textures get mapped to objects
2014-04-12 01:37:31	@J	or, rather, the shader _defines_ mapping the texture to the object
2014-04-12 01:37:36	@Espyo	right, 01:32	Espyo	uh, scratch all of that until the "you can do stuff with the pixels"
2014-04-12 01:38:17	@J	and it doesn't have to be a texture - you write code that gets executed on the GPU to generate the pixels directly
2014-04-12 01:38:30	@Espyo	right
2014-04-12 01:38:37	@Espyo	should help for a couple of things in the engine
2014-04-12 01:38:44	@Espyo	like making pale Pikmin
2014-04-12 01:38:47	@Espyo	when they're idle
2014-04-12 01:38:47	@J	and then I think the GPU runs it massively in parallel
2014-04-12 01:39:03	@Espyo	right now, there's a graphic for normal Pikmin and idle
2014-04-12 01:39:05	@Espyo	which is just wasteful
2014-04-12 01:39:16	@Espyo	but coloring something paler is actually pretty darn hard in real-time
2014-04-12 01:39:29	@J	hmm, really?
2014-04-12 01:39:36	@J	you just mix it with a colour
2014-04-12 01:39:45	@J	semi-transparent white
2014-04-12 01:39:52	@Espyo	it's subtractive
2014-04-12 01:39:54	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-04-12 01:40:10	@Espyo	y—
2014-04-12 01:40:11	@Espyo	wait
2014-04-12 01:40:11	Spark	<Espyo> : they aren't /that/ bad... right?
2014-04-12 01:40:11	@J	should be able to do lots of types of colour merging
2014-04-12 01:40:18	Spark	nah they're good it just takes some getting used to
2014-04-12 01:40:25	@Espyo	I would imagine so...
2014-04-12 01:40:32	@Espyo	they blend kinda badly
2014-04-12 01:40:40	@J	yeah, individually, they're not bad
2014-04-12 01:40:52	@Espyo	yeah, I was looking, Allegro has multiple blender mods
2014-04-12 01:40:53	@Espyo	*modes
2014-04-12 01:40:55	@Espyo	and I knew it did
2014-04-12 01:40:59	@Espyo	and I knew one of them was addictive
2014-04-12 01:41:00	@J	but they don't work together as well as they could
2014-04-12 01:41:03	@Espyo	but I could swear I had that on already
2014-04-12 01:41:04	@J	addictive
2014-04-12 01:41:06	@Espyo	right
2014-04-12 01:41:06	@J	best typo
2014-04-12 01:41:12	@Espyo	add...
2014-04-12 01:41:14	@Espyo	uh
2014-04-12 01:41:17	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	does it have blast processing>
2014-04-12 01:41:21	@Espyo	additive isn't even a word here
2014-04-12 01:41:32	@Espyo	IAMAHIPO_ocolor: it will when I install the Sanic chip
2014-04-12 01:41:38	Spark	wouldnt it be easier to make an onion sprite that recolors for each type?
2014-04-12 01:41:51	@Espyo	yeah, but I can't have that
2014-04-12 01:42:02	@Espyo	someone might have a "Spiky Pikmin" as a Pikmin type
2014-04-12 01:42:06	@Espyo	and its Onion could have spikes
2014-04-12 01:42:09	@Espyo	hence, different bitmaps
2014-04-12 01:42:15	Spark	oh that makes sense
2014-04-12 01:42:29	@Espyo	ok, I'm already using the additive blend mode
2014-04-12 01:43:23	@Espyo	https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/al_draw_tinted_bitmap
2014-04-12 01:43:27	@Espyo	it /only/ multiplies
2014-04-12 01:43:28	@Espyo	drat
2014-04-12 01:43:36	Spark	you could use SFML
2014-04-12 01:43:38	@Espyo	the blender mode is only for blitting
2014-04-12 01:43:42	@Espyo	too late to change now
2014-04-12 01:43:52	Spark	is the source included
2014-04-12 01:44:02	Spark	i could try making it sfml if youre too busy
2014-04-12 01:44:17	Spark	im not a great programmer as you know but it shouldnt be too hard, just tedious
2014-04-12 01:45:04	@J	source is https://github.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine
2014-04-12 01:45:12	@J	but that doesn't sound like it would be fun
2014-04-12 01:46:10	@Espyo	yeah, a lot of things are pretty different
2014-04-12 01:46:20	@J	https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/al_set_blender
2014-04-12 01:46:28	@J	you draw a bitmap to another with a blending mode
2014-04-12 01:46:28	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-12 01:47:04	@Espyo	yep, blitting
2014-04-12 01:48:17	@J	anyway, I should go
2014-04-12 01:48:24	@J	sleep is already happening
2014-04-12 01:48:30	IAMAHIPO_ocolor	goodnight
2014-04-12 01:49:11	@Espyo	same here
2014-04-12 01:49:16	@Espyo	and thanks for tonight J
2014-04-12 01:49:18	@Espyo	it was a huge help
2014-04-12 01:49:27	@Espyo	I really have to read better on how the blending modes work
2014-04-12 01:49:37	@Espyo	I cannot for the life of me get my head around the concept of pre-multiplied colors
2014-04-12 01:50:05	@J	no problem
2014-04-12 01:50:18	@J	and just try them in a graphics program, I guess, see what happens
2014-04-12 01:50:20	@J	bye
2014-04-12 01:51:04	@Espyo	yeah

2014-04-12 20:49:26	@Espyo	"In Pokos, used in Mission Mode"
2014-04-12 20:49:33	@PikFan	yeah, about that
2014-04-12 20:49:44	@PikFan	I'm not so sure we should use "Pokos"
2014-04-12 20:49:45	@Espyo	or maybe just call that field "Pokos"
2014-04-12 20:49:49	@PikFan	could be anything

2014-04-12 20:49:54	@Espyo	oh, it's not clear?
2014-04-12 20:50:02	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-12 20:50:04	@Espyo	well, /points/ is probably the most accurate
2014-04-12 20:50:05	@PikFan	it's just a coin
2014-04-12 20:50:09	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-12 20:50:29	@PikFan	"In Mission Mode, this fruit is slightly more common, and is worth 1,000."
2014-04-12 20:50:43	@PikFan	yeah, I didn't use Pokos or points
2014-04-12 20:50:58	@PikFan	points is most reasonable
2014-04-12 20:51:18	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-12 20:51:28	@Espyo	or maybe just avoid any name-calling whatsoever
2014-04-12 20:51:31	@Espyo	the field is "Value"
2014-04-12 20:51:49	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-12 20:51:58	@Espyo	and when you mouse-over, you get "How much the fruit is worth in Mission Mode."

2014-04-13 20:01:23	@PikFan	don't we just love clots?
2014-04-13 20:01:24	@PikFan	.
2014-04-13 20:01:33	@Espyo	indeed
2014-04-13 20:02:31	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2014-04-13 20:02:59	@PikFan	by the time I reset I SHOULD have gotten all make x cookies with 1 building achievements
2014-04-13 20:03:48	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-04-13 20:03:57	@PikFan	oh
2014-04-13 20:04:09	@PikFan	there are achievements for buildings
2014-04-13 20:04:23	@PikFan	for example, Gushing Grannies
2014-04-13 20:04:38	@PikFan	you have to make 1 quintillion cookies just from grandmas
2014-04-13 20:05:42	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-13 20:05:47	@Espyo	but how would you get that by resetting
2014-04-13 20:06:04	@PikFan	I don't
2014-04-13 20:06:21	@PikFan	I said by the time I reset I should have gotten all those achievements
2014-04-13 20:06:37	@PikFan	I'm aiming to make 1.9 sextillion this game
2014-04-13 20:07:08	@Espyo	but what do you mean "should"?
2014-04-13 20:07:11	@Espyo	you don't know?
2014-04-13 20:07:14	@Espyo	is resetting random now?
2014-04-13 20:07:17	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-13 20:07:21	@PikFan	I don't know
2014-04-13 20:07:23	@Espyo	what
2014-04-13 20:07:38	@PikFan	wait, what did you mean by "is resetting random now"
2014-04-13 20:08:33	@Espyo	dude
2014-04-13 20:08:36	@Espyo	you reset when you want to
2014-04-13 20:08:43	@Espyo	so only reset after you get the achivement
2014-04-13 20:08:46	@Espyo	*achievement
2014-04-13 20:09:20	@PikFan	I'm resetting once I make 1.9 sextillion cookies
2014-04-13 20:09:42	@PikFan	see, I'm trying to follow a pattern
2014-04-13 20:10:05	@PikFan	I want each reset to yield more HCs than the last reset
2014-04-13 20:11:52	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-13 20:11:56	@Espyo	just reset after the achievement
2014-04-13 20:12:01	@Espyo	achievements = more CpS
2014-04-13 20:12:19	@PikFan	I understand that
2014-04-13 20:12:45	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-04-13 20:12:53	@PikFan	not even halfway to resetting
2014-04-13 20:13:09	@PikFan	but over halfway to getting praise the sun
2014-04-13 20:13:21	@PikFan	(make 100 quintillion with just prisms)
2014-04-13 20:15:52	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-04-13 20:17:00	@PikFan	oh, I just realized something
2014-04-13 20:17:21	@PikFan	elder frenzy + reindeer seems more common than frenzy + click frenzy
2014-04-13 20:17:48	@PikFan	I got a F+CF last night, and got about 50 quintillion
2014-04-13 20:18:13	@PikFan	EF+R yields about 37 quint
2014-04-13 20:20:30	@PikFan	oh, also
2014-04-13 20:20:52	@PikFan	I think Orteil should make a golden cookie upgrade
2014-04-13 20:21:11	@PikFan	this one will double the effects of golden cookies
2014-04-13 20:21:46	@PikFan	that is, make frenzy x14, clicking frenzy x1,554, and lucky 40 minutes of cps
2014-04-13 20:22:00	@PikFan	but it would cost 777.8 quint
2014-04-13 20:22:51	@PikFan	ooh, got Click Delegator
2014-04-13 20:22:57	@PikFan	1 quint with cursors
2014-04-13 20:23:17	@Espyo	well yeah
2014-04-13 20:23:27	@Espyo	you can get a reindeer at any point during a GC's effects
2014-04-13 20:23:39	@Espyo	but you can only get a GC 3 or so minutes after the previous one
2014-04-13 20:24:04	@PikFan	more like 2 minutes
2014-04-13 20:24:19	@Espyo	could swear I read 3 minutes on the wiki, last I checked
2014-04-13 20:24:31	@PikFan	>the wiki
2014-04-13 20:25:02	@PikFan	well, if they appeared in 3 minute intervals then I
2014-04-13 20:25:12	@PikFan	'd never gotten as far as I am now
2014-04-13 20:26:27	@Espyo	could've been from ages ago
2014-04-13 20:26:37	@Espyo	the only wiki is on wikia
2014-04-13 20:26:42	@Espyo	so saying wiki or wikia is the same in this case
2014-04-13 20:27:11	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-13 20:30:41	@PikFan	ok yeah, F+CF yields more than EF+R
2014-04-13 20:31:27	@PikFan	F+CF gives 52.596 quint, and EF+R gives 38.604 quint
2014-04-13 20:32:25	@PikFan	brb
2014-04-13 20:33:22	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-13 20:33:24	@Espyo	ok
2014-04-13 20:41:23	@Espyo	by my calculations, I get...
2014-04-13 20:41:29	@Espyo	 42 quint after popping them all
2014-04-13 20:41:42	@Espyo	...I need 70 quint for the next prism, and I have 10 quint
2014-04-13 20:41:46	@Espyo	gaaaaahhhhhh...
2014-04-13 20:42:14	@PikFan	back
2014-04-13 20:42:30	@PikFan	are your calculations not taking GCs into effect?
2014-04-13 20:42:36	@Espyo	yeah, they're not
2014-04-13 20:42:40	@PikFan	ah
2014-04-13 20:42:41	@Espyo	just the withered CpS
2014-04-13 20:42:51	@Espyo	still, best case scenario, I get enough to buy one prism
2014-04-13 20:42:55	@Espyo	here's what I'll do
2014-04-13 20:43:01	@Espyo	I'll pop one, see how many cookies I get
2014-04-13 20:43:03	@Espyo	then close
2014-04-13 20:43:05	@Espyo	and reload
2014-04-13 20:43:07	@Espyo	so I can get it back
2014-04-13 20:43:12	@Espyo	gotta make sure the game doesn't save in the meantime
2014-04-13 20:43:19	@PikFan	right
2014-04-13 20:44:02	@Espyo	wow!
2014-04-13 20:44:09	@Espyo	I got 5 whole quint!
2014-04-13 20:44:13	@Espyo	that's INCREDIBLE
2014-04-13 20:44:21	@PikFan	wow!
2014-04-13 20:44:26	@Espyo	it will only take me 40 years to buy a prism at this rate!
2014-04-13 20:44:29	@Espyo	...ugh
2014-04-13 20:44:43	@PikFan	idea
2014-04-13 20:44:44	@Espyo	but yeah, guess my calculation is right
2014-04-13 20:44:48	@PikFan	we should have a petition
2014-04-13 20:44:49	@Espyo	 50 quint after popping them all
2014-04-13 20:44:56	@PikFan	get thousands of signatures
2014-04-13 20:45:07	@PikFan	and send it to Orteil
2014-04-13 20:45:24	@PikFan	the petition asking, "Please make Prisms cost 50 billion again!"
2014-04-13 20:45:28	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-13 20:45:31	@Espyo	I don't mind
2014-04-13 20:45:44	@Espyo	it's only doubled or something
2014-04-13 20:46:21	@PikFan	base prices is 75 billion now
2014-04-13 20:46:27	@PikFan	*price

2014-04-13 20:47:23	@PikFan	so close to magnum opus
2014-04-13 20:47:42	@PikFan	10 quad with alchemy labs
2014-04-13 20:48:04	@Espyo	not even double

2014-04-14 01:47:41	Nepeta	because
2014-04-14 01:47:56	Nepeta	i dont want to
2014-04-14 01:48:04	@PikFan	wynaut
2014-04-14 01:48:25	Nepeta	i already invested too much time 
2014-04-14 01:48:31	@PikFan	true
2014-04-14 01:48:45	@PikFan	but you'd get like
2014-04-14 01:48:49	@PikFan	hundreds of thousands
2014-04-14 01:48:53	@PikFan	if not millions
2014-04-14 01:49:00	@PikFan	your game, I guess

2014-04-14 01:49:17	Nepeta	i dont really play it that much
2014-04-14 01:49:20	Nepeta	anymore

2014-04-14 01:49:32	Nepeta	to do whatever comes from it
2014-04-14 01:49:38	Nepeta	and if i reset i would have ton invest more time
2014-04-14 01:49:54	@PikFan	I see
2014-04-14 01:50:03	@PikFan	so you just play passively, then
2014-04-14 01:50:36	Meisterbot	do heavenly chips rely on the bank
2014-04-14 01:50:44	Meisterbot	or how many cookies you baked in the game
2014-04-14 01:51:03	@Espyo	how many you baked
2014-04-14 01:51:04	@PikFan	how many cookies you baked
2014-04-14 01:51:14	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-14 01:51:19	@Espyo	if you reset now, you can probably reach 1 sextillion in 10 minutes
2014-04-14 01:51:33	Meisterbot	so if i reset now, i would get 462 chips
2014-04-14 01:51:44	@PikFan	462 isn't really much

2014-04-14 23:33:55	@Espyo	doing transformations to align the map and the paths is super easy
2014-04-14 23:34:07	@Espyo	but a simple translation to make the map image start at 0,0 so I can export to a bitmap
2014-04-14 23:34:13	@Espyo	that, for some reason, is taking me over one hour
2014-04-14 23:36:45	@Espyo	the image is drawn in the world coordinates X and Y
2014-04-14 23:36:51	@Espyo	so to start at 0,0, I translate to -X and -Y
2014-04-14 23:36:54	@Espyo	but... nope
2014-04-14 23:59:32	@Espyo	...finally
2014-04-14 23:59:36	@Espyo	it's been far too long
2014-04-14 23:59:43	@Espyo	since I made any progress
2014-04-15 00:24:25	@PikFan	.
2014-04-15 00:25:11	@PikFan	holy asdfghhjkl
2014-04-15 00:25:21	@PikFan	popped a wrinkler and it gave 27 quint
2014-04-15 00:25:26	@PikFan	refreshed of course
2014-04-15 00:25:50	@Espyo	wow
2014-04-15 00:26:00	@Espyo	also PikFan, I got two interesting news
2014-04-15 00:28:38	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-04-15 00:28:56	@Espyo	first of all, while searching for places to announce the engine in, I though of Reddit
2014-04-15 00:28:58	@Espyo	I took a visit
2014-04-15 00:29:19	@Espyo	and I noticed that the sidebar on the /Pikmin/ reddit has a link to Pikipedia as the wiki, and no links to wikia
2014-04-15 00:29:31	@Espyo	so at LEAST from Reddit we're not losing traffic
2014-04-15 00:29:57	@PikFan	yay
2014-04-15 00:30:09	@PikFan	but
2014-04-15 00:30:22	@PikFan	what if there are other Pikmin reddits, and they link to wikia
2014-04-15 00:30:29	@Espyo	I think there's only one
2014-04-15 00:30:33	@PikFan	or is there only one — ok, good
2014-04-15 00:31:20	@Espyo	secondly, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikmin_2_path%202014-04-14%2020-44-25-91.png weee
2014-04-15 00:31:29	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-15 00:31:36	@PikFan	are those like carrying routes
2014-04-15 00:32:56	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-15 00:33:03	@PikFan	ah
2014-04-15 00:33:16	@Espyo	it was easy to make (except for one part that literally took over an hour when it should've taken 5 minutes tops)
2014-04-15 00:33:21	@Espyo	and it's of some good interest
2014-04-15 00:33:26	@Espyo	not like a must-have, but it's pretty neat
2014-04-15 00:33:28	@PikFan	right
2014-04-15 00:33:36	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User:Peach Bulborb by Peach Bulborb (+19 Master flower rank!) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User:Peach_Bulborb&curid=6237&diff=44054&oldid=44038
2014-04-15 00:34:08	@PikFan	so if there's an object that's not on a point, do the Pikmin carry the object to the nearest point and start following the shortest route?
2014-04-15 00:34:55	@Espyo	I believe so
2014-04-15 00:35:03	@Espyo	that's the method I'm thinking for the engine
2014-04-15 00:35:09	@Espyo	that's the method that makes sense
2014-04-15 00:35:19	@Espyo	all clues about how the paths and the data files are made point to that
2014-04-15 00:35:22	@Espyo	so it has to work like that
2014-04-15 00:35:28	@PikFan	pretty straightforward
2014-04-15 00:35:29	@Espyo	so far, I haven't spotted any troublesome places
2014-04-15 00:35:46	@Espyo	but I did notice that the PP has three waypoints that don't link to anything
2014-04-15 00:36:00	@Espyo	I suppose the game must ignore them, because one of them is where the can-opener is
2014-04-15 00:36:06	@PikFan	weird
2014-04-15 00:36:10	@Espyo	wait, that's no can opener
2014-04-15 00:36:16	@Espyo	the uh... bottle opener
2014-04-15 00:36:34	@PikFan	...what are you talking about
2014-04-15 00:36:40	@Espyo	the Impediment Scourge
2014-04-15 00:36:41	@Espyo	ugh
2014-04-15 00:36:44	@Espyo	took a while to remember
2014-04-15 00:36:49	@PikFan	oh heh
2014-04-15 00:36:58	@Espyo	yeah, there's one lone waypoint with no connections on the stump with the Impediment Scourge
2014-04-15 00:37:03	@Espyo	so I guess the game makes lone waypoints be ignored
2014-04-15 00:37:10	@PikFan	odd
2014-04-15 00:37:16	@Espyo	or else the Pikmin would get stuck on that point all the time when retrieving the IS

2014-04-15 00:50:03	@Espyo	all right, click now
2014-04-15 00:55:10	@Espyo	well?
2014-04-15 00:56:07	@PikFan	I like the AW's style better
2014-04-15 00:56:37	@PikFan	I mean, the arrows are good, I like that
2014-04-15 00:56:39	@Espyo	in what regard?
2014-04-15 00:56:56	@Espyo	the background color?
2014-04-15 00:56:59	@PikFan	I don't see why there are those huge green lines
2014-04-15 00:57:08	@Espyo	those are part of the information
2014-04-15 00:57:13	@Espyo	notice how they have different widths
2014-04-15 00:57:21	@Espyo	err, thicknesses

2014-04-15 01:11:49	@PikFan	right, but
2014-04-15 01:11:56	@PikFan	what do the thicknesses mean
2014-04-15 01:12:08	@Espyo	I don't know yet
2014-04-15 01:12:12	@Espyo	two hypotheses:
2014-04-15 01:12:24	@Espyo	or three
2014-04-15 01:12:38	@Espyo	a) it specifies the max girth of the object that can go through
2014-04-15 01:13:06	@Espyo	so you don't try carrying a giant treasure through a small tunnel
2014-04-15 01:13:20	@Espyo	b) it specifies how close the Pikmin need to be to be considered "on-path"
2014-04-15 01:13:37	@Espyo	so a thicker line means more leeway to have the Pikmin be considered following the path
2014-04-15 01:13:46	@Espyo	while thinner lines make the Pikmin be more precise before they keep going

2014-04-15 01:13:53	@Espyo	this allows them to align properly with tight entrances
2014-04-15 01:14:05	@Espyo	or c) it's some sort of preference number
2014-04-15 01:14:21	@Espyo	maybe the higher it is, the higher the chances of the Pikmin following that path instead of others
2014-04-15 01:14:31	@Espyo	probably one or both of the first two
2014-04-15 01:15:55	@PikFan	uh-oh
2014-04-15 01:16:00	@PikFan	CC isn't working...!
2014-04-15 01:16:14	@PikFan	ok, so here's what happened
2014-04-15 01:16:24	@PikFan	I somehow went to the previous page
2014-04-15 01:16:37	@PikFan	even though the "Do you want to leave?" notification is enabled
2014-04-15 01:16:44	@PikFan	and now I can't get back in
2014-04-15 01:21:05	@Espyo	uh, weird
2014-04-15 01:21:16	@Espyo	also I just realized, that "thickness" is set on a per-waypoint basis
2014-04-15 01:21:22	@Espyo	not on a per-path basis
2014-04-15 01:21:29	@Espyo	so maybe it's the waypoint's radius
2014-04-15 01:25:27	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Output.png what about this?
2014-04-15 01:26:05	@PikFan	a bit better
2014-04-15 01:26:15	@PikFan	what do the different sized circles mean, though?
2014-04-15 01:26:31	@PikFan	...oh, that's AW
2014-04-15 01:27:23	@Espyo	yeah, what I said above
2014-04-15 01:27:31	@Espyo	except I guess now point b) is moot
2014-04-15 01:27:36	@Espyo	rather, point a)
2014-04-15 01:27:40	@Espyo	actually, I don't know
2014-04-15 01:32:42	@Espyo	why are there so many points near the Bulblax Kingdom entrance?
2014-04-15 01:32:46	@Espyo	what's in there that's so special?
2014-04-15 01:40:10	@Espyo	hey, those two unconnected waypoints in PP
2014-04-15 01:40:20	@Espyo	they're on the bridge that leads to the Shower Room
2014-04-15 01:40:26	@Espyo	and there is no path there
2014-04-15 01:40:34	@Espyo	so if you don't destroy the pre-SR clog
2014-04-15 01:40:47	@Espyo	build the bridge, go there with Blues
2014-04-15 01:40:57	@Espyo	kill the Wogpoles, bring them to land
2014-04-15 01:41:05	@Espyo	then have non-Blues carry them
2014-04-15 01:41:13	@Espyo	...they should go through he water

2014-04-16 16:08:40	@PikFan	on [[Carrying#Paths]], it says "In addition, some paths are bidirectional. It is unknown why this is the case"

2014-04-16 16:09:00	@PikFan	they're bidirectional because of the Onions
2014-04-16 16:09:20	@PikFan	for VoR through PP, anyway
2014-04-16 16:09:38	@PikFan	I found a set of those bidirectional routes in the WW
2014-04-16 16:09:58	@PikFan	it's in that arena with the two Orange Bulborbs
2014-04-16 16:10:11	@PikFan	they're bidirectional there because of the two gates
2014-04-16 16:11:08	@PikFan	oh, another thing

2014-04-16 16:12:01	@PikFan	it's actually under the bridge
2014-04-16 16:12:20	@PikFan	so Pikmin can carry something that's underneath that bridge

2014-04-19 01:16:57	@Espyo	I remember one of them: can you double-check that you cannot skip the sunset cutscenes in NTSC GCN P?
2014-04-19 01:17:36	@PikFan	yeah, you can't
2014-04-19 01:18:34	@Espyo	ok, great
2014-04-19 01:18:38	@Espyo	'cause you can in the PAL version
2014-04-19 01:18:51	@Espyo	and I was wondering if it was just an emulation problem

2014-04-19 01:30:16	@PikFan	that raises a good point
2014-04-19 01:30:58	@PikFan	yeah, I would get sucked into the GSJ, freeze it
2014-04-19 01:31:22	@Espyo	yeah, but it's kinda moot
2014-04-19 01:33:01	@PikFan	then circle the stick around
2014-04-19 01:33:05	@PikFan	and it'd break apart
2014-04-19 01:33:12	@PikFan	i.e. explode

2014-04-19 01:37:23	@PikFan	maybe you could try reconstructing them

2014-04-19 20:34:58	@Espyo	PikFan: what was your suggestion, then?
2014-04-19 20:35:10	@PikFan	09:25	PikFan	try a thin outline
2014-04-19 20:35:44	@Espyo	on which?
2014-04-19 20:35:55	@Espyo	the originals or the smoothened originals
2014-04-19 20:36:10	@Espyo	..."smoothed"
2014-04-19 20:36:34	@PikFan	...both? not sure what you mean
2014-04-19 20:36:46	@Espyo	the originals end with rough edges
2014-04-19 20:36:52	@Espyo	the smooth ones don't
2014-04-19 20:36:59	@Espyo	you can tell easily with the ADF
2014-04-19 20:37:06	@Espyo	...*EFD
2014-04-19 20:37:11	@Espyo	not the Anti-Dioxin Filter
2014-04-19 20:38:07	@PikFan	...I'
2014-04-19 20:38:12	@PikFan	m still confused
2014-04-19 20:38:25	@PikFan	because you gave me one set with an outline, and another without
2014-04-19 20:38:34	@Espyo	oh, drat
2014-04-19 20:38:41	@Espyo	all right, never mind
2014-04-19 20:42:36	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/EFD.zip
2014-04-19 20:42:39	@Espyo	what do you think of these?
2014-04-19 20:43:29	@Espyo	brb, dinner
2014-04-19 20:44:39	@PikFan	hmm, I like the 1 outline, smooth A one
2014-04-19 21:27:18	@Espyo	like as in "like more than the others", or as in "like as opposed to dislike"?
2014-04-19 21:30:59	@PikFan	former
2014-04-19 21:31:06	@Espyo	right
2014-04-19 21:31:11	@Espyo	I wanted to have icons
2014-04-19 21:31:16	@Espyo	to tie in with the treasure and fruit icons
2014-04-19 21:31:29	@PikFan	yes
2014-04-19 21:31:30	@Espyo	also to make a map-navbox for P1 areas
2014-04-19 21:31:40	@Espyo	but it's hard to make these crappy icons look good...
2014-04-19 21:31:51	@Espyo	oh, I thought of something yesterday
2014-04-19 21:31:56	@PikFan	...don't we have a map navbox already?
2014-04-19 21:32:03	@Espyo	nope
2014-04-19 21:32:11	@Espyo	that's wikia
2014-04-19 21:32:12	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Areas
2014-04-19 21:32:17	@Espyo	oh, not like that
2014-04-19 21:32:17	@Espyo	per-map
2014-04-19 21:32:22	@PikFan	...oh
2014-04-19 21:32:22	@Espyo	per-area, I mean
2014-04-19 21:32:32	@PikFan	oh, I get what you're saying
2014-04-19 21:32:36	@Espyo	anyway, I thought of grabbing the 3D model images we have on the part articles
2014-04-19 21:32:42	@Espyo	and make icons out of those
2014-04-19 21:32:44	@Espyo	gotta give it a shot
2014-04-19 21:33:01	@PikFan	that's what I was saying last night
2014-04-19 21:33:11	@Espyo	I don't recall you ever saying it :|
2014-04-19 21:33:21	@PikFan	...
2014-04-19 21:33:38	@Espyo	|:
2014-04-19 21:33:40	@Espyo	I'll try tomorrow
2014-04-19 21:33:42	@Espyo	got plans now
2014-04-19 21:33:51	@Espyo	but while I wait for my slow friends to join Brawl...
2014-04-19 21:33:56	@Espyo	there's something I wanna discuss
2014-04-19 21:34:08	@Espyo	I've been thinking, I'll start "advertising" the engine in places, soon
2014-04-19 21:34:25	@Espyo	and... well, I'll bring people to Fanon and hopefully Pikipedia
2014-04-19 21:34:33	@PikFan	I see
2014-04-19 21:34:34	@Espyo	but the way Fanon is right now... it'll drive people away
2014-04-19 21:34:44	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-19 21:35:00	@PikFan	it'd take massive agreement and cooperation to fix all of Fanon
2014-04-19 21:35:08	@Espyo	instead of looking like an encyclopedia of fan ideas, it looks like a pile of quick sketches tossed at random
2014-04-19 21:35:32	@PikFan	there are some diamonds in the rough, though
2014-04-19 21:36:13	@Espyo	I mean... wow http://www.pikminfanon.com/Orange_Pikmin
2014-04-19 21:36:15	@Espyo	there are, yes
2014-04-19 21:36:16	@PikFan	01:39:21: <PikFan> maybe you could try reconstructing them
2014-04-19 21:36:30	@Espyo	oh, that's not what I thought you meant
2014-04-19 21:36:38	@Espyo	I thought you meant like making them by eye in Inkscape
2014-04-19 21:36:54	@Espyo	now, I was thinking grabbing the actual infobox pic, scaling it to icon size, and adding a border
2014-04-19 21:37:04	@PikFan	mm
2014-04-19 21:39:22	@PikFan	I... suppose you could try that
2014-04-19 21:39:46	@PikFan	it'd look better than those horrid textures, at least
2014-04-19 21:40:40	@Espyo	yeah, hopefully
2014-04-19 21:40:48	@Espyo	also I'm not quite sure how to add borders that aren't rough
2014-04-19 21:40:50	@Espyo	need J for this
2014-04-19 21:41:42	@Espyo	all right, I have some ideas
2014-04-19 21:41:45	@Espyo	they're pretty obvious
2014-04-19 21:41:51	@Espyo	infoboxes, organized
2014-04-19 21:41:59	@Espyo	consistent sections
2014-04-19 21:42:01	@Espyo	consistent articles
2014-04-19 21:42:03	@Espyo	categories
2014-04-19 21:42:53	@Espyo	we should have like a forum post for a major overhaul
2014-04-19 21:43:00	@Espyo	I'd be willing to help a bit
2014-04-19 21:43:03	@Espyo	move stuff about, categorize
2014-04-19 21:43:14	@PikFan	also, might want to read this, even though it was from 3 years ago http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Topic:Thoughts_on_wiki_structure&t=20121126000956
2014-04-19 21:44:07	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-04-19 21:44:14	@Espyo	ok, articles should be minimized
2014-04-19 21:44:20	@Espyo	if you only have ideas for a game, only have an article about it
2014-04-19 21:44:30	@PikFan	right
2014-04-19 21:44:31	@Espyo	but if you have detailed ideas for enemies and such, you should make an article about the enemy list
2014-04-19 21:44:42	@Espyo	as for canon content, 99% of it should be Pikipedia-exclusive
2014-04-19 21:44:44	@PikFan	we also need to get rid of all the disambig pages out there
2014-04-19 21:44:55	@Espyo	"please read the page on Pikipedia for canon info" should be more than enough
2014-04-19 21:44:59	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-04-19 21:45:13	@Espyo	as for ownership, people own ideas, not articles
2014-04-19 21:45:14	@PikFan	yeah, we have a template [[F:Template:Canon]]
2014-04-19 21:45:14	Testyo	"Template:Canon" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:Canon
2014-04-19 21:45:18	@Espyo	yeah, you do
2014-04-19 21:45:22	@Espyo	but it should replace canon info
2014-04-19 21:45:30	@Espyo	instead, there's the template AND c+p canon info
2014-04-19 21:45:31	@PikFan	err
2014-04-19 21:45:40	@PikFan	[[F:Template:Pikipedia]]
2014-04-19 21:45:40	Testyo	"Template:Pikipedia" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Template:Pikipedia
2014-04-19 21:45:53	Spark	is it possible to have interwiki redirects because that might be a good idea or something idk
2014-04-19 21:45:59	@PikFan	yeah
2014-04-19 21:46:09	@PikFan	about that
2014-04-19 21:46:22	@PikFan	in the infoboxes there were a TON of yellow canon links
2014-04-19 21:46:34	@PikFan	so I redirected them to Pikipedia
2014-04-19 21:48:06	@Espyo	it is, I think
2014-04-19 21:48:10	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-19 21:48:21	@Espyo	signing articles = no
2014-04-19 21:48:24	@PikFan	also I suggested this a while back http://www.pikminfanon.com/Topic:Spelling/Grammar/Syntax_Rules
2014-04-19 21:48:34	@Espyo	user prioritization = poop
2014-04-19 21:48:46	@PikFan	there was this too http://www.pikminfanon.com/PikminFanon:Formatting_Policy
2014-04-19 21:49:04	@Espyo	agree, there should be proper grammar and such

2014-04-20 19:00:01	@PikFan	ok, so remember yesterday how we were talking about area maps?
2014-04-20 19:00:40	@Espyo	yeah?
2014-04-20 19:00:55	@PikFan	this is a map from the Prima Guide http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130814190042/pikmin/images/a/a3/Garden_of_Hope.png
2014-04-20 19:01:02	@PikFan	for the Garden of Hope
2014-04-20 19:01:10	@PikFan	imo it looks confusing

2014-04-20 19:01:44	@Espyo	hm, looks simple to me
2014-04-20 19:02:03	@PikFan	what I could try doing is making a map
2014-04-20 19:02:14	@PikFan	similar to what I did with the Silver Lake
2014-04-20 19:02:23	@Espyo	ah yes
2014-04-20 19:02:30	@PikFan	though that'd take an extremely long time
2014-04-20 19:02:38	@Espyo	is it that big?
2014-04-20 19:03:00	@PikFan	http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130814190042/pikmin/images/a/a3/Garden_of_Hope.png http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/6/64/Silver_Lake_treasures_map.png
2014-04-20 19:03:31	@PikFan	also not sure what I should do about obstacles
2014-04-20 19:03:51	@PikFan	should I have them appear destroyed or not?
2014-04-20 19:03:52	@Espyo	hm, good point...
2014-04-20 19:04:01	@Espyo	you should try having them up
2014-04-20 19:04:05	@PikFan	alright
2014-04-20 19:04:32	@PikFan	also, about the ship part icons
2014-04-20 19:04:35	@PikFan	they look good
2014-04-20 19:04:46	@PikFan	somewhat nostalgic though
2014-04-20 19:04:59	@PikFan	er
2014-04-20 19:05:01	@PikFan	familiar
2014-04-20 19:05:09	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-20 19:05:12	@Espyo	they look Pikmin 2-ish
2014-04-20 19:05:24	@PikFan	oh, that's why
2014-04-20 19:05:51	@PikFan	...like the Piklopedia icons
2014-04-20 19:06:09	@PikFan	anyway
2014-04-20 19:06:49	@Espyo	also I made a navbox map for the AW already
2014-04-20 19:06:58	@PikFan	ooh
2014-04-20 19:07:29	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/AW%20map.zip
2014-04-20 19:09:31	@PikFan	hmm, might want to fix the pair of BWs
2014-04-20 19:09:38	@PikFan	*BSs
2014-04-20 19:10:00	@PikFan	the one on the top is covering the bottom one
2014-04-20 19:11:31	@Espyo	hm, guess it doesn't really make sense, huh
2014-04-20 19:14:58	@Espyo	about fanon
2014-04-20 19:15:08	@Espyo	the only way it'll progress is if we put our foot down
2014-04-20 19:15:18	@Espyo	we can't just go "let's discuss some rules somewhere"
2014-04-20 19:15:31	@Espyo	and then for weeks on end we don't even have a single forum post
2014-04-20 19:15:36	@Espyo	we gotta act, and we gotta act now
2014-04-20 19:16:02	@PikFan	I agree
2014-04-20 19:16:12	@PikFan	this has been going on for far too long
2014-04-20 19:16:37	@PikFan	ever since I made an account—no, before then, even, people would make low quality articles
2014-04-20 19:17:03	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-04-20 19:17:11	@Espyo	all right, here's my idea:
2014-04-20 19:17:15	@Espyo	we discuss a few rules real quick
2014-04-20 19:17:23	@Espyo	using your old topic you linked to yesterday
2014-04-20 19:17:28	@PikFan	which one?
2014-04-20 19:17:29	@Espyo	then put a forum post with them
2014-04-20 19:17:35	@Espyo	the one with those bullet points
2014-04-20 19:17:43	@PikFan	the long one?
2014-04-20 19:17:46	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-20 19:17:49	@Espyo	then, we give people one week to give feedback
2014-04-20 19:17:58	@Espyo	after one week, we'll start implementing the rules and such
2014-04-20 19:18:09	@Espyo	and in the meantime, edit the news bar to highlight this discussion
2014-04-20 19:18:15	@PikFan	right
2014-04-20 19:18:48	@Espyo	I can't find your post
2014-04-20 19:18:50	@Espyo	can you link me to it?
2014-04-20 19:18:52	@PikFan	also, if a person creates a low quality article, we give them a notice
2014-04-20 19:18:57	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-20 19:19:07	@PikFan	saying to fix it in 3 days
2014-04-20 19:19:15	@PikFan	if they don't, it gets deleted
2014-04-20 19:19:19	@Espyo	well, not necessarily so harshly
2014-04-20 19:19:27	@Espyo	because I think making pages ownerless would be for the best
2014-04-20 19:19:38	@Espyo	imagine there's like a foreign fan that has loads of ideas
2014-04-20 19:19:43	@Espyo	but their grammar is bad here and there
2014-04-20 19:19:50	@Espyo	well, we can't really go hard on them, just have somebody fix it up a bit
2014-04-20 19:20:09	@Espyo	now, if they complain that their article is being edited, they receive five across the face
2014-04-20 19:20:48	@Espyo	while you fetch me the link again... PFE news: for some reason, Olimar is animated while using a spray, but not while dismissing
2014-04-20 19:20:59	@Espyo	even though the code is exactly the same in both, and exactly the same animation
2014-04-20 19:21:06	@PikFan	hmm
2014-04-20 19:21:20	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Topic:Thoughts_on_wiki_structure&t=20121126000956
2014-04-20 19:21:28	@Espyo	there we go
2014-04-20 19:21:39	@Espyo	let me take a stab at compiling a short list of points
2014-04-20 19:21:56	@Espyo	oh, I see what's happening
2014-04-20 19:22:06	@Espyo	the code never runs because I tell it to leave, in case I have no Pikmin
2014-04-20 19:22:09	@Espyo	and I have no Pikmin
2014-04-20 19:22:26	@PikFan	heh
2014-04-20 19:22:35	@PikFan	you sabotaged your own code
2014-04-20 19:25:44	@Espyo	all right, can you explain to me, in brief, what the guild system is?
2014-04-20 19:25:56	@PikFan	ok so
2014-04-20 19:26:34	@PikFan	the guild system is made of the Red Bulborb, Hairy Bulborb, Orange Bulborb, and Spotty Bulbear
2014-04-20 19:26:42	@PikFan	each has a specific role

2014-04-20 19:28:06	@PikFan	Snow Bulborbs help users get used to the wiki
2014-04-20 19:28:17	@PikFan	Red Bulborbs fix up articles

2014-04-20 19:28:56	@PikFan	Spotty Bulbear takes care of the administrative stuff
2014-04-20 19:29:29	@Espyo	hm
2014-04-20 19:29:44	@PikFan	personally Red Bulborbs need reworking
2014-04-20 19:29:56	@PikFan	because the people who are Red Bulborbs
2014-04-20 19:30:04	@PikFan	don't even adhere to grammar rules
2014-04-20 19:33:09	@Espyo	bleh
2014-04-20 19:33:47	@PikFan	also, remember how we were talking about no ownership?
2014-04-20 19:33:55	@PikFan	what about games and stuff?
2014-04-20 19:34:32	@PikFan	I don't want some person just waltzing in and putting in ideas into my game
2014-04-20 19:36:38	@Espyo	yeah, I tweaked that a bit
2014-04-20 19:36:41	@Espyo	you own your ideas
2014-04-20 19:36:46	@Espyo	you don't own your articles
2014-04-20 19:36:49	@Espyo	but it's more like
2014-04-20 19:37:16	@Espyo	you what ideas are put on the wiki, from your content, but not the way they're put
2014-04-20 19:37:23	@Espyo	I'm typing it all down

2014-04-20 19:50:19	Testyo	50 K = -223.15 °C / -369.67 °F
2014-04-20 19:51:26	@Espyo	I'll never get there

2014-04-21 00:36:07	Spark	its like fanfiction but less plot based which makes no sense
2014-04-21 00:36:13	Spark	(says a former admin on fantendo)
2014-04-21 00:37:18	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-21 00:38:28	@PikFan	hmm
2014-04-21 00:40:46	@PikFan	is my game detailed enough? [[f:Pikmin: Connection of the Worlds]]
2014-04-21 00:40:47	Testyo	"Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds
2014-04-21 00:41:53	Spark	yeah
2014-04-21 00:42:23	@Espyo	well some things are highly detailed, others not so much
2014-04-21 00:42:33	@PikFan	such as...?
2014-04-21 00:42:37	Spark	i mean i dont have a problem with fangames it just seems a bit odd to make a fictional video game
2014-04-21 00:42:46	Spark	cuz you cant play it
2014-04-21 00:42:56	@PikFan	that's why Espyo's making the engine
2014-04-21 00:43:07	Spark	yep
2014-04-21 00:43:10	Spark	tis a noble goal
2014-04-21 00:43:13	@Espyo	it just stretches the imagination 
2014-04-21 00:43:15	@Espyo	it's healthy
2014-04-21 00:43:30	@PikFan	Espyo: what parts could I improve upon?
2014-04-21 00:43:32	@Espyo	PikFan: err, never mind
2014-04-21 00:43:41	@Espyo	I read the links to other pages as "just names"
2014-04-21 00:43:48	@Espyo	but of course, you have more info on those things than "just names"
2014-04-21 00:44:04	@PikFan	I'm confused
2014-04-21 00:44:25	@PikFan	wait, never mind
2014-04-21 00:44:35	@PikFan	yeah, I need to work on the gameplay modes
2014-04-21 00:44:40	@PikFan	those are really lacking
2014-04-21 00:45:00	@PikFan	I had a document on the desktop, and it had challenge mode names
2014-04-21 00:45:20	@Espyo	hm
2014-04-21 00:45:47	@Espyo	speaking of documents, I'm currently drawing a map for my fan game
2014-04-21 00:45:53	@PikFan	oh come on, reindeer had to appear JUST AFTER elder frenzy?!
2014-04-21 00:45:55	@Espyo	I'm really liking how it's turning out...
2014-04-21 00:45:58	@Espyo	hehehe, troll
2014-04-21 00:46:13	@PikFan	indeed
2014-04-21 00:46:46	@PikFan	was going to make this a while ago but never got to it http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds/Cave_Creator
2014-04-21 00:46:59	@PikFan	it'd probably work similar to P2 caves
2014-04-21 00:47:08	@PikFan	oh!
2014-04-21 00:47:09	@Espyo	I'll try doing something of the sort for the enigne
2014-04-21 00:47:11	@Espyo	*engine
2014-04-21 00:47:20	@PikFan	maybe you could help me with that
2014-04-21 00:47:36	@Espyo	 /that/?
2014-04-21 00:47:42	@PikFan	and I could add technical stuff to cave pages
2014-04-21 00:48:14	@PikFan	the text files would be in English, of course...
2014-04-21 00:48:43	@Espyo	I'm not following
2014-04-21 00:48:53	@PikFan	actually no, that wouldn't work
2014-04-21 00:49:11	@PikFan	since sublevels aren't randomly generated
2014-04-21 00:49:27	@PikFan	bleh
2014-04-21 00:50:15	@Espyo	I still have no idea what we're talking about
2014-04-21 00:50:28	@PikFan	ok
2014-04-21 00:50:38	@PikFan	so you know the sublevel technical template on Pikipedia?
2014-04-21 00:50:42	@Espyo	mhm?
2014-04-21 00:50:54	@PikFan	well I was thinking of adapting that to my game
2014-04-21 00:51:10	@PikFan	then I remembered that all sublevels in my game aren't randomly generated
2014-04-21 00:51:18	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-21 00:51:19	@PikFan	so it'd be pointless
2014-04-21 00:51:21	@Espyo	right
2014-04-21 00:51:34	@PikFan	I mean, it might be useful for Cave Creator
2014-04-21 00:51:46	@PikFan	if you wanted to make simple, P2-style caves
2014-04-21 00:51:47	@Espyo	but remember, Cave Creator won't be a thing
2014-04-21 00:51:59	@Espyo	it'll be a thing players can do using the engine's internal tools
2014-04-21 00:52:16	@Espyo	I can't spend my time redoing the engine's editor mode copy-pasted in-game
2014-04-21 00:52:55	@PikFan	right, but this is assuming that it was actually develope
2014-04-21 00:52:58	@PikFan	*developed
2014-04-21 00:53:02	@PikFan	on a console
2014-04-21 00:53:07	@PikFan	...which it will never be
2014-04-21 00:53:20	@PikFan	(unless I somehow gain a team of developers)
2014-04-21 00:53:29	@Espyo	of course
2014-04-21 00:53:34	@Espyo	you could be hired by Nintendo
2014-04-21 00:53:35	@Espyo	never say never
2014-04-21 00:54:05	@PikFan	hah, highly doubtful that they'd just give me some devs and make a Pikmin game
2014-04-21 01:01:30	@Espyo	but yeah, that text file
2014-04-21 01:01:36	@Espyo	should we make a forum post with that?
2014-04-21 01:10:23	Meisterbot	do you wanna pluck a pikmin
2014-04-21 01:10:25	Meisterbot	it doesnt have to be a pikmin
2014-04-21 01:10:55	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-21 01:12:02	@PikFan	tomorrow
2014-04-21 01:12:20	@PikFan	gonna be rainy tomorrow, and it's sunny today
2014-04-21 01:12:42	@PikFan	so

2014-04-23 00:51:03	@PikFan	.
2014-04-23 00:54:15	@Espyo	hey
2014-04-23 00:54:20	@Espyo	dammit, I needed J, but he's not around
2014-04-23 00:54:28	@Espyo	also it's Ludum Dare this weekend
2014-04-23 00:54:29	@PikFan	what for?
2014-04-23 00:54:34	@Espyo	so me and him are probably participating
2014-04-23 00:54:46	@Espyo	the engine has a massive framerate leak
2014-04-23 00:54:49	@Espyo	...for no apparent reason
2014-04-23 00:54:49	@PikFan	Ludum Dare... isn't that a game you and J play
2014-04-23 00:54:56	@PikFan	...uh-oh
2014-04-23 00:54:57	@Espyo	not a game, a competition to MAKE a game
2014-04-23 00:55:02	@PikFan	oh
2014-04-23 00:55:11	@Espyo	it's so weird
2014-04-23 00:55:13	@PikFan	...but in that sense, it could be considered a game
2014-04-23 00:55:22	@Espyo	I pin-pointed that the problem is
2014-04-23 00:55:37	@Espyo	there's a line that sets a Pikmin's animation to the idle animation
2014-04-23 00:55:46	@Espyo	if I remove that line, there is no framerate drop
2014-04-23 00:56:31	@Espyo	that line changes the animation IF the animation isn't already the idle one
2014-04-23 00:56:48	@Espyo	so if the Pikmin are already on that idle animation, the function does nothing
2014-04-23 00:56:54	@Espyo	and that's exactly what it does: nothing
2014-04-23 00:56:59	@Espyo	because the Pikmin are always in that idle animation
2014-04-23 00:57:14	@Espyo	and that nothingness causes a framerate drop from ~120 to ~25
2014-04-23 00:57:34	@Espyo	needed him for ideas on what the problem could be

2014-04-24 18:46:44	@J	.
2014-04-24 18:47:57	@J	hmm, since when has Portal 2 had proper support for offline splitscreen co-op?
2014-04-24 18:49:48	@J	...but only with 2 controllers?
2014-04-24 18:58:55	@Espyo	hey
2014-04-24 18:58:57	@Espyo	you're finally here
2014-04-24 18:59:00	@Espyo	you missed out on quite a bit
2014-04-24 18:59:09	@Espyo	and it's had it for at least a few months
2014-04-24 18:59:30	@Espyo	I suppose one player being K+M and another being a joystick would be unfair
2014-04-24 19:19:33	@J	but it's co-op
2014-04-24 19:19:48	@Espyo	...right
2014-04-24 19:20:29	@Espyo	are you joining this weekend's LD?
2014-04-24 19:20:33	@Espyo	speaking of which, I have to vote today
2014-04-24 19:23:25	@J	and yeah, I've been around a few days already, but didn't say anything
2014-04-24 19:23:27	@J	hmm, not sure
2014-04-24 19:23:49	@J	I kind of want to focus on stuff I've already started rather than start another new game
2014-04-24 19:27:37	@Espyo	it's just a little thing
2014-04-24 19:27:43	@Espyo	only for competition's sake
2014-04-24 19:27:47	@Espyo	I never did anything with my Caverns
2014-04-24 19:27:50	@Espyo	don't really plan to
2014-04-24 19:28:14	@J	I know, but if I make a game and I like it, I will want to continue it
2014-04-24 19:28:45	@J	also, what's with this role reversal?
2014-04-24 19:29:03	@Espyo	you being away must've messed something
2014-04-24 19:29:15	@Espyo	and now the ecosystem of #pikipedia's users is compromised
2014-04-24 19:31:27	@Espyo	let's see, what else did you miss...
2014-04-24 19:31:30	@Espyo	or presumably missed
2014-04-24 19:31:38	@Espyo	uh, there was a performance problem on the engine
2014-04-24 19:31:43	@Espyo	I needed you to try to brainstorm
2014-04-24 19:31:46	@Espyo	but I eventually figured it out
2014-04-24 19:32:10	@Espyo	protip for the future, don't access associative array elements 360 times per second, when the key is a string
2014-04-24 19:32:20	@Espyo	at least in C++
2014-04-24 19:32:27	@J	doesn't sound like it should be too bad
2014-04-24 19:32:32	@Espyo	it doesn't, does it?
2014-04-24 19:32:34	@Espyo	but I made a test
2014-04-24 19:32:41	@J	you should be able to do it millions of times
2014-04-24 19:32:46	@J	guess it depends how it's implemented
2014-04-24 19:33:04	@Espyo	accessing the tenth element of a vector took 1. something seconds, with 1M iterations
2014-04-24 19:33:05	Testyo	1 m = 1.0936 yd / 3.2808 ft / 52.6316 Olimar-heights / 166.666 TRY-heights
2014-04-24 19:33:13	@Espyo	if it's not 1M, it's 10M or something
2014-04-24 19:33:13	Testyo	1 m = 1.0936 yd / 3.2808 ft / 52.6316 Olimar-heights / 166.666 TRY-heights
2014-04-24 19:33:16	@Espyo	can't be bothered to check
2014-04-24 19:33:27	@J	yeah, well that's going to be faster, since it's just a memory lookup in an already-known position
2014-04-24 19:33:36	@Espyo	accessing the element with the key "10", in an AA with "1", "2", etc...
2014-04-24 19:33:40	@Espyo	took 130+ seconds
2014-04-24 19:34:02	@Espyo	when the strings are keys, it has to allocate memory for the string, dealocate, check each character...
2014-04-24 19:34:09	@Espyo	so I guess it makes sense that it's slow
2014-04-24 19:34:09	@J	I just accessed an associative array key 100M times, took 2.8s in Python 3
2014-04-24 19:34:10	@Espyo	but yikes
2014-04-24 19:34:10	Testyo	100 m = 109.36 yd / 328.08 ft / 5263.16 Olimar-heights / 16666.6 TRY-heights
2014-04-24 19:34:17	@Espyo	what about a regular vector?
2014-04-24 19:36:28	@J	well, the standard equivalent in Python seems to actually be slower
2014-04-24 19:36:34	@J	but that's a linked list or something
2014-04-24 19:38:32	@J	hmm, an array is also slower
2014-04-24 19:39:41	@J	hmm, a bytearray seems to be much faster
2014-04-24 19:39:52	@J	oh, never mind, I did it wrong
2014-04-24 19:41:12	@J	so yeah, associative arrays faster
2014-04-24 19:41:13	@J	fun
2014-04-24 19:41:53	@Espyo	how weird
2014-04-24 19:42:02	@J	speed depends on the type of key, though
2014-04-24 19:42:12	@Espyo	it should
2014-04-24 19:42:27	@J	numbers are faster than strings, strings are faster than functions
2014-04-24 19:43:03	@J	bytestrings are faster than unicode strings
2014-04-24 19:43:12	@J	anyway, 360/s shouldn't be slow at all
2014-04-24 19:49:00	@J	okay, and for comparison, my Raspberry Pi can do 10M in 20s (almost 100x slower)
2014-04-24 19:49:00	Testyo	10 m = 10.936 yd / 32.808 ft / 526.316 Olimar-heights / 1666.66 TRY-heights
2014-04-24 20:00:45	@Espyo	yeah, it shouldn't
2014-04-24 20:00:50	@Espyo	C++ just isn't good with strings
2014-04-24 20:01:03	@Espyo	every time you add or remove a character, it destroys the string and recreates it
2014-04-24 20:01:12	@Espyo	there might be some leeway, like only every 5 characters, but overall, that's it
2014-04-24 20:01:31	@Espyo	anyway, I kinda needed strings because the animations and frames are referred to by name
2014-04-24 20:01:51	@Espyo	like the animation "get_up" has the frame "half_lying" and the frame "idle"
2014-04-24 20:02:07	@Espyo	luckily, I can just make it so that after the animation is loaded, it fetches the necessary frames once, and saves a pointer
2014-04-24 20:02:09	@Espyo	done, fast again
2014-04-24 20:19:47	@Espyo	another thing you missed: some weeks ago, some guy posted a huge dump of AR codes on his (?) forum
2014-04-24 20:19:52	@Espyo	including some P1 and P2 codes
2014-04-24 20:20:05	@Espyo	there are a few that activate new debug features
2014-04-24 20:20:14	@Espyo	still needs investigation, but I played around a bit
2014-04-24 20:20:32	@Espyo	other codes do stuff like this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Dolphin%202014-04-23%2023-10-14-24.png https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Dolphin%202014-04-23%2023-06-54-32.png
2014-04-24 20:25:42	@J	[20:01:03] @Espyo every time you add or remove a character, it destroys the string and recreates it
2014-04-24 20:25:49	@J	but you still have C strings if you want, I guess
2014-04-24 20:26:09	@J	but yeah, Python strings are immutable anyway
2014-04-24 20:26:26	@J	in fact, if you create two strings with the same thing in them, they point to the same location in memory
2014-04-24 20:26:55	@J	hmm, sometimes, anyway
2014-04-24 20:26:57	@Espyo	...C strings
2014-04-24 20:26:58	@Espyo	you're kidding
2014-04-24 20:27:13	@Espyo	instead of developing the engine in two years or so, I would die of old age before finishing it
2014-04-24 20:27:25	@Espyo	plus I just can't make heads or toes about C strings
2014-04-24 20:27:33	@J	that's probably true
2014-04-24 20:27:38	@Espyo	"sometimes" should be right
2014-04-24 20:27:44	@Espyo	@Python string thing
2014-04-24 20:28:21	@J	multiple Olimars looks like platypi for some reason
2014-04-24 20:28:29	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-24 20:32:18	@Espyo	another thing: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/P1%20final.zip
2014-04-24 20:44:59	@J	where did they come from?
2014-04-24 20:45:12	@J	I ask because I saw the previous versions, and they looked much worse
2014-04-24 20:46:20	@Espyo	the official renders we have on the infoboes
2014-04-24 20:46:22	@Espyo	*infoboxes
2014-04-24 20:46:36	@J	you have much larger versions, then?
2014-04-24 20:46:41	@Espyo	just resized them, cut them with the path tool, and added a border
2014-04-24 20:46:54	@Espyo	no, I only added the borders after they were 30 something by 30 something
2014-04-24 20:47:02	@Espyo	don't know any other way
2014-04-24 20:47:07	@Espyo	even the borders aren't that great
2014-04-24 20:47:10	@Espyo	how do YOU do it?
2014-04-24 20:47:15	@Espyo	I just can't figure out a good way at all
2014-04-24 20:48:20	@J	I told you a few times
2014-04-24 20:48:36	@J	how did you add a border here, then?
2014-04-24 20:49:20	@J	in GIMP, you just do layer/alpha to selection, then selection/grow by however many px you want, then fill
2014-04-24 20:49:47	@J	possibly feather before filling, depending on how the edges look
2014-04-24 20:50:21	@J	when you say 'cut them', you mean they had a white background or something?
2014-04-24 20:51:07	@Espyo	exactly what I did
2014-04-24 20:51:12	@Espyo	white background, yep
2014-04-24 20:51:26	@Espyo	well, I suppose I have more control over my border when I do it on the tiny icon
2014-04-24 20:51:35	@Espyo	because I want it to be 1px
2014-04-24 20:51:58	@Espyo	and I don't want to calculate what size to grow the selection by to make the final border be 1px, after resizing
2014-04-24 20:55:00	@J	hmm
2014-04-24 20:55:22	@J	when I did it, I wasn't aiming for a final border size, I was aiming for a size that looked good in relation the the full-sized icon
2014-04-24 20:55:31	@J	you don't necessarily need a 1px final border
2014-04-24 20:59:47	@Espyo	hmm
2014-04-24 20:59:52	@Espyo	yeah, but I wanted to make it consistent
2014-04-24 21:02:34	@Espyo	also: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/AW%20map.zip
2014-04-24 21:02:36	@Espyo	and dinner now
2014-04-24 21:06:26	@J	hmm
2014-04-24 21:06:39	@J	I don't know, seems a little cluttered
2014-04-24 21:06:49	@J	maybe the icons could be smaller (or the map bigger)
2014-04-24 21:08:13	@J	have you considered having a map where you can select a number of filters to turn icons on/off by type?  eg. enemies, treasures...
2014-04-24 21:25:56	@Espyo	probably too complex
2014-04-24 21:26:03	@Espyo	and cluttered — that's the size of the map we have
2014-04-24 21:32:58	@J	just make it bigger
2014-04-24 21:42:23	@Espyo	blurry, probably poop
2014-04-24 21:54:46	@J	meh, you're not even meant to focus on the background anyway
2014-04-24 21:56:10	@Espyo	true
2014-04-24 21:56:25	@Espyo	you've seen the Pikmin 2 path images, right?

2014-04-24 22:45:06	@J	how did you remove the objects?
2014-04-24 22:46:36	@Espyo	it's automatically done
2014-04-24 22:46:39	@Espyo	I just had to stay away

2014-04-24 22:47:06	@Espyo	that "glitch" needs a major rewrite
2014-04-24 22:47:11	@J	oh, free look actually moves the in-game concept of the camera?
2014-04-24 22:48:47	@J	hmm, I guess it's feasible that render distance is based on the actual camera position rather than where the game thinks it chose to place the camera
2014-04-24 22:49:02	@J	I can't see how that would work with more recent OpenGL, though
2014-04-24 22:49:26	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-24 22:52:30	@Espyo	TFN is just filled with problems though
2014-04-24 22:52:42	@Espyo	the top of the map, the beach area, and the BLL arena all load individually
2014-04-24 22:53:03	@Espyo	so I have to get close enough to load the area, but far away enough for the HUD to not show
2014-04-24 22:53:12	@Espyo	luckily the HUD is HALF a world object
2014-04-24 22:53:19	@Espyo	so if I move the camera away, the HUD goes with
2014-04-24 22:53:31	@Espyo	unfortunately, for every 10 units I move, the HUD moves 5
2014-04-24 22:53:42	@Espyo	*10 units I move the camera
2014-04-24 22:53:48	@Espyo	so I need to have the camera really far
2014-04-24 22:54:01	@J	that almost made some sense
2014-04-24 22:54:08	@Espyo	it's Pikmin
2014-04-24 22:54:16	@Espyo	turns out that, like Pikmin 2, it doesn't like to make sense
2014-04-24 22:54:29	@Espyo	and all those weird things must've messed with the angles or something, because Hugin had a hard time doing the image
2014-04-24 22:54:34	@Espyo	plus another problem: lighting
2014-04-24 22:54:49	@Espyo	TFN is really dark, except for the bit where you're at
2014-04-24 22:54:52	@Espyo	also except for the starting area
2014-04-24 22:55:06	@Espyo	I was thinking of relighting the darker bits a bit, after the final image is done
2014-04-24 22:55:11	@Espyo	but what if that doesn't work well at all?
2014-04-24 22:55:49	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/TFN.png this was my last attempt
2014-04-24 23:02:32	@J	hmm, yeah
2014-04-24 23:03:11	@J	maybe there's just a file somewhere with the lighting values in nice plain obvious text...
2014-04-24 23:07:11	@Espyo	I think there is... /something/
2014-04-24 23:07:27	@Espyo	but anyway, after that horrible waste of time, I did TDS...
2014-04-24 23:07:32	@Espyo	which is a lot larger and more complex
2014-04-24 23:07:36	@Espyo	and it came out perfect the first time
2014-04-24 23:07:47	@Espyo	well, some tiny bits OoB look slightly wonky, but I'm cropping those anyway
2014-04-24 23:10:05	@Espyo	http://pastebin.com/kJviFNVa well
2014-04-24 23:11:05	@J	hey look
2014-04-24 23:11:32	@Espyo	I only caught your sarcasm afterwards
2014-04-24 23:17:27	@Espyo	>crop TDS
2014-04-24 23:17:30	@Espyo	>click copy
2014-04-24 23:17:33	@Espyo	>click paste in new image
2014-04-24 23:17:36	@Espyo	>TFH pops up
2014-04-24 23:17:38	@Espyo	...wait what
2014-04-24 23:17:49	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure I copy+pasted trillions of things in the meantime
2014-04-24 23:18:04	@J	turns out they're the same place and no-one ever noticed
2014-04-24 23:19:10	@Espyo	so TFN, TDS, AW and PP
2014-04-24 23:19:12	@Espyo	Nintendo's slacking
2014-04-24 23:20:45	@Espyo	I wanted to make the edges of the TDS map fade into black
2014-04-24 23:20:50	@Espyo	any way to do so in GIMP?
2014-04-24 23:24:20	@J	select the rough region, grow, feather, invert, fill black in a lower layer
2014-04-24 23:25:06	@Espyo	I searched around for feather, but couldn't find it
2014-04-24 23:25:31	@Espyo	oh drat
2014-04-24 23:25:33	@Espyo	it's in Portuguese
2014-04-24 23:25:34	@Espyo	found it now
2014-04-24 23:25:57	@J	wouldn't've helped, but more programs need searchable menus
2014-04-24 23:26:04	@J	and searchable settings
2014-04-24 23:26:04	@Espyo	hehe
2014-04-24 23:26:10	@Espyo	VLC has searchable settings
2014-04-24 23:26:14	@J	it does?
2014-04-24 23:26:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-24 23:26:26	@Espyo	speaking of VLC, that's how I watch YT videos now
2014-04-24 23:26:27	@J	ah, so it does
2014-04-24 23:26:27	@Espyo	I can't go back
2014-04-24 23:26:39	@J	by downloading them first?
2014-04-24 23:26:57	@Espyo	nope, you can feed it the URL of the video directly
2014-04-24 23:27:03	@J	oh, yeah, that
2014-04-24 23:28:05	@J	I think you can even just give it YouTube video IDs
2014-04-24 23:28:55	@J	only problem is you can't say which quality you want (I don't think), so I use 'youtube-dl -g', which generates a URL with the quality settings you specify
2014-04-24 23:29:02	@J	and pass that into VLC
2014-04-24 23:30:32	@J	I've been meaning to switch to mplayer at some point, anyway, just can't be bothered to actually do it
2014-04-24 23:31:01	@Espyo	there's a setting on VLC that allows you to pick the quality the videos are loaded at
2014-04-24 23:32:35	@J	hmm, can't seem to find it

2014-04-24 23:32:55	@J	hey, I never noticed that before: ctrl-v on VLC plays from what you have copied
2014-04-24 23:33:00	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-24 23:33:09	@Espyo	it's pretty amazing
2014-04-24 23:34:04	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/TDS%20final.png I feel like there's something painfully wrong with this, but I can't tell what
2014-04-24 23:35:58	@J	nothing looks wrong to me
2014-04-24 23:36:04	@J	maybe more feathering on the borders?
2014-04-24 23:36:41	@J	and maybe try increasing the overall brightness?
2014-04-24 23:36:55	@J	but nothing stands out as wrong
2014-04-24 23:37:17	@J	why did the bridge remain, but not the gates?
2014-04-24 23:37:28	@Espyo	very good question, I have no idea
2014-04-24 23:37:32	Spark	its beautiful
2014-04-24 23:37:33	@Espyo	but it happens on all stages
2014-04-24 23:37:35	@Espyo	thanks
2014-04-24 23:37:40	@J	all bridges?
2014-04-24 23:37:47	@Espyo	I think so, yeah
2014-04-24 23:37:57	@Espyo	which means I'll have to open the TFT ones for the sake of consistency
2014-04-24 23:38:03	@Espyo	this save doesn't have them opened, I don't think
2014-04-24 23:38:41	@J	open = built?
2014-04-24 23:38:56	@J	because I see one built here, one not
2014-04-24 23:39:20	@J	oh, is that one partially built?
2014-04-24 23:39:25	@J	...and open = not built?
2014-04-24 23:39:33	@Espyo	built, eah
2014-04-24 23:39:34	@Espyo	*yeah
2014-04-24 23:39:37	@Espyo	one not?
2014-04-24 23:39:52	@J	near the bones or whatever they were
2014-04-24 23:40:12	@Espyo	...crud
2014-04-24 23:40:16	@Espyo	they are unbuilt
2014-04-24 23:40:21	@Espyo	..........
2014-04-24 23:40:54	@J	also, maybe play with some other background colours
2014-04-24 23:40:55	@Espyo	what now
2014-04-24 23:41:02	@Espyo	besides black?
2014-04-24 23:41:05	@J	yeah
2014-04-24 23:41:26	@J	maybe even one matching the overall area's hue, just much lighter or darker, and less saturated
2014-04-24 23:41:32	@J	or just transparency
2014-04-24 23:42:46	@J	and I wouldn't worry about the bridges
2014-04-24 23:42:53	@J	could even try removing them altogether
2014-04-24 23:42:55	@Espyo	but lack of detaaaaaaail...
2014-04-24 23:43:32	@Espyo	I'm not feeling the transparency or fade to blue
2014-04-24 23:43:49	@Espyo	I mean, the fade to this blue looks kind of ok, but all other images have a black background...
2014-04-24 23:47:09	@J	white?
2014-04-24 23:48:17	@Espyo	oh, I forgot to send it to Dropbox
2014-04-24 23:48:52	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Sem%20t%C3%ADtulo.png
2014-04-24 23:48:55	@Espyo	white looks ok
2014-04-24 23:50:04	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/white.png
2014-04-24 23:56:04	@J	well, I wouldn't say you went 'much lighter or darker' with that greeny one, but I can see what you're saying
2014-04-24 23:56:16	@J	yeah, I guess the black works best
2014-04-24 23:56:28	@J	makes the whole thing look quite dark, though
2014-04-24 23:56:32	@J	anyway, I should go
2014-04-24 23:56:44	@J	bye
2014-04-24 23:56:48	@Espyo	bye
2014-04-24 23:57:03	@Espyo	I'll try lightening it up tomorrow

2014-04-25 23:48:53	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-25 23:49:15	@PikFan	lol what
2014-04-25 23:49:40	@Espyo	when I was documenting the Pikmin numbers and such for the CM levels
2014-04-25 23:49:53	@Espyo	I noticed a setting for the starting number of Pikmin type "6"
2014-04-25 23:50:04	@Espyo	 0 is blue, 1 is red, 2 is yellow
2014-04-25 23:50:06	@Espyo	or something of the sort
2014-04-25 23:50:16	@Espyo	 5 is Bulbmin, and 6 is...? we didn't know
2014-04-25 23:50:18	@PikFan	so on to 5, which is Bulbming
2014-04-25 23:50:19	@Espyo	all CM levels had 0
2014-04-25 23:50:21	@PikFan	*Bulbmin
2014-04-25 23:50:33	@Espyo	so I made a stage start with 25 "6"s
2014-04-25 23:50:40	@Espyo	and got disappointed because I still started with Red Pikmin
2014-04-25 23:50:46	@Espyo	but wait, I have 75 now, not 5
2014-04-25 23:50:47	@Espyo	*50
2014-04-25 23:50:50	@Espyo	did it really add them...?
2014-04-25 23:50:58	@Espyo	what if they're different, actually? let me dismiss
2014-04-25 23:51:04	@PikFan	so technically there are now 9 Pikmin species
2014-04-25 23:51:04	@Espyo	wait a second, those aren't Reds, those are...
2014-04-25 23:51:07	@Espyo	 /what/
2014-04-25 23:51:10	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-25 23:51:19	@Espyo	but the carrots aren't really canon, just a by-product of the Piklopedia
2014-04-25 23:51:25	@PikFan	right
2014-04-25 23:51:32	@Espyo	anyway, second awesome thing
2014-04-25 23:51:40	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/TFN%20final.png boom
2014-04-25 23:51:53	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-04-25 23:52:13	@PikFan	isn't Pikpik carrot supposed to be a proper noun?
2014-04-25 23:52:28	@PikFan	/WHAT/
2014-04-25 23:52:41	@PikFan	ok, HOW did you make that
2014-04-25 23:52:45	@Espyo	:D
2014-04-25 23:52:48	@Espyo	a lot of hard work
2014-04-25 23:52:54	@PikFan	that is
2014-04-25 23:52:55	@Espyo	you know how Dolphin allows you to freely move the camera?
2014-04-25 23:52:56	@PikFan	literally
2014-04-25 23:53:01	@PikFan	the most amazing thing
2014-04-25 23:53:05	@PikFan	I've ever seen
2014-04-25 23:53:10	@Espyo	why thank you
2014-04-25 23:53:13	@PikFan	well, one of the most amazing
2014-04-25 23:53:18	@Espyo	TFN was by far the hardest one
2014-04-25 23:53:21	@Espyo	it kept working wrong
2014-04-25 23:53:23	Spark	dude what happened to "a good programmer doesnt make a good artist" xP
2014-04-25 23:53:31	Spark	thats ffing beautiful
2014-04-25 23:53:33	@Espyo	but I didn't draw it, I just took screenshots
2014-04-25 23:53:37	@Espyo	using the free cam
2014-04-25 23:53:44	@Espyo	then a program stitched them together
2014-04-25 23:53:45	@PikFan	ok wikia is going to be super jealous
2014-04-25 23:53:52	@Espyo	hopefully
2014-04-25 23:53:58	@Espyo	or rather, hopefully they won't notice
2014-04-25 23:54:00	@Espyo	or else stealy stealy
2014-04-25 23:54:13	Spark	photography is art ;)
2014-04-25 23:54:14	@Espyo	for TFN, I also had to hack the game to remove the lighting
2014-04-25 23:54:20	@Espyo	hehe, I suppose
2014-04-25 23:54:29	@PikFan	one thing though
2014-04-25 23:54:35	@PikFan	why are some things missing
2014-04-25 23:54:47	@PikFan	like the two gates next to the BBL's arena
2014-04-25 23:54:51	@PikFan	*BLL
2014-04-25 23:55:33	@Espyo	there should be no gates to begin with
2014-04-25 23:55:39	@Espyo	another problem with TFN: it loads in chunks
2014-04-25 23:55:46	@Espyo	the beach, the top and the BLL arena are all different bits
2014-04-25 23:55:48	@Espyo	and I have to get close
2014-04-25 23:55:57	@PikFan	...should be no gates to begin with?
2014-04-25 23:55:58	@Espyo	unfortunately, getting close also means the gates and such are rendered
2014-04-25 23:56:01	@PikFan	what do you mean?
2014-04-25 23:56:08	@Espyo	gates are objects
2014-04-25 23:56:08	@PikFan	...oh, I see what you mean
2014-04-25 23:56:12	@Espyo	not object geometry
2014-04-25 23:56:18	@PikFan	they shouldn't be there
2014-04-25 23:56:22	@Espyo	although, cardboard boxes and bridges are objects as well
2014-04-25 23:56:24	@Espyo	but those are always visible
2014-04-25 23:56:30	@PikFan	imo they look good there
2014-04-25 23:56:31	@Espyo	you know how stuff goes invisible and inactive when you're far away?
2014-04-25 23:56:38	@Espyo	everything except boxes and bridges, I suppose
2014-04-25 23:56:39	@PikFan	yeah?
2014-04-25 23:56:43	@Espyo	they do, but it's inconsistent
2014-04-25 23:56:49	@Espyo	so I'll remove them with GIMP, if I can
2014-04-25 23:57:00	@Espyo	if not, I seriously cannot be bothered to try again
2014-04-25 23:57:01	@PikFan	inconsistent how
2014-04-25 23:57:09	@Espyo	because in the other areas, they don't exist either
2014-04-25 23:57:19	@J	if you try that, best way is probably to install the resynthesize plugin
2014-04-25 23:57:24	@J	then do enhance/heal
2014-04-25 23:57:27	@PikFan	...oh, duh
2014-04-25 23:57:32	@J	with the thing selected
2014-04-25 23:57:34	@Espyo	plus I'm pretty sure there might be one or two gates on that TFN one missing
2014-04-25 23:57:38	@Espyo	hmm, thanks for the tip
2014-04-25 23:57:40	@Espyo	I was wondering
2014-04-25 23:57:49	@Espyo	also, off-topic, but I won't join LD
2014-04-25 23:57:55	@Espyo	too busy with this, plus the engine and all

2014-04-26 00:17:49	@PikFan	bah
2014-04-26 00:18:01	@Espyo	eesh

2014-04-26 00:32:23	@Espyo	all right, how would I lighten up the areas shaded by the leaves?

2014-04-26 19:12:23	@PikFan	no clue then
2014-04-26 19:13:00	@Espyo	hmm
2014-04-26 19:13:02	@J	well, I'll probably end up using input, but there are reasons I shouldn't
2014-04-26 19:13:07	@Espyo	user-defined?
2014-04-26 19:13:17	@Espyo	also hi
2014-04-26 19:13:20	@J	hey
2014-04-26 19:13:28	@PikFan	hi
2014-04-26 19:13:35	@J	you're asking if this means user-defined input?
2014-04-26 19:14:42	@Espyo	nope, that was a suggestion
2014-04-26 19:15:00	@J	oh
2014-04-26 19:15:07	@J	...maybe I should explain what I'm doing
2014-04-26 19:15:32	@J	it's for a general input/event system, specifically for games
2014-04-26 19:15:59	@J	an input might be a hardware input, or it might be virtual (triggered from code), or it might be a combination of other inputs
2014-04-26 19:16:16	@Espyo	you probably want "event" then
2014-04-26 19:16:21	@Espyo	or "trigger"
2014-04-26 19:16:30	@J	hmm
2014-04-26 19:16:43	@J	event feels like the output part
2014-04-26 19:17:01	@J	the inputs do trigger what I would call events (in the form of function calls)
2014-04-26 19:17:26	@J	also, yeah, I know I already wrote an input system, but there are problems and I think I can do better
2014-04-26 19:17:43	@Espyo	event doesn't really feel outputy
2014-04-26 19:18:29	@J	hmm, I guess I could use event, if you think it makes sense
2014-04-26 19:19:52	@Espyo	it should
2014-04-26 19:20:09	@Espyo	on key down, on my_function call, on timer
2014-04-26 19:20:49	@J	okay then
2014-04-26 19:23:30	@J	one thing I'm planning: provide a class which acts to 'fill out' a type of event, so it's easy to produce multiple implementations with a full interface
2014-04-26 19:24:09	@J	eg. for a button, you define up/down triggers, then mix in the Button class, and it gives you a held state, timed repetition, double-click, etc.
2014-04-26 19:24:17	@Espyo	ah, yes
2014-04-26 19:24:20	@Espyo	good thinking
2014-04-26 19:26:12	@J	also, the thing that manages events doesn't actually do anything, but you can add sources of input, eg. make a source that links up Pygame events to my events
2014-04-26 19:26:44	@Espyo	I think Allegro kind of works the same way
2014-04-26 19:27:54	@J	hmm, I would've thought that since it also provides an actual hardware interface, it would just use that one
2014-04-26 19:28:39	@Espyo	huh?
2014-04-26 19:31:31	@J	I mean, it lets you get keyboard, etc. events, right?  So I would've expected it to just allow triggering events from those ones implemented by Allegro, rather than allowing you to define your own sources of events
2014-04-26 19:34:07	@Espyo	it does both
2014-04-26 19:34:26	@Espyo	you register a source of an event as the keyboard, mouse, a specific timer, a specific window, or you can register your own sources and events
2014-04-26 20:18:20	@J	...okay, how is it suddenly gone 8pm?
2014-04-26 20:18:24	@J	I thought it was 5 or so

2014-04-27 14:41:43	@J	so, API design question
2014-04-27 14:41:59	@J	some events can contain other events, and when you add one you need to map 'component' of the child to the parent
2014-04-27 14:42:17	@Espyo	not really seeing how events can contain others
2014-04-27 14:42:27	@J	for example, you might want to map a button to the 'left' component of an axis, or map the left of an axis to the right of another axis
2014-04-27 14:42:44	@J	so that you can combine events, or treat them like something else
2014-04-27 14:43:08	@Espyo	still don't really see how that's...
2014-04-27 14:43:10	@J	treat 4 keyboard keys like an analogue stick by mapping them to a 2D axis
2014-04-27 14:43:19	@Espyo	you mean event = input, in this case?
2014-04-27 14:43:29	@Espyo	either way, I can only really see one event anyway
2014-04-27 14:43:32	@J	hey, you told me to call them events
2014-04-27 14:43:36	@Espyo	on axis 1 right
2014-04-27 14:43:40	@Espyo	on axis 1 up
2014-04-27 14:43:59	@Espyo	regardless of you pressing a key, mouse button, or move an analog stick, it triggers only axis 1 right, or left, or whatever
2014-04-27 14:44:03	@J	yes, but 'axis 1 right' is now triggered by you D key
2014-04-27 14:44:04	@Espyo	unless you mean like
2014-04-27 14:44:06	@J	*your
2014-04-27 14:44:25	@Espyo	pressing numpad9 to do an axis 1 right and an axis 1 up events
2014-04-27 14:44:27	@Espyo	at the same time
2014-04-27 14:44:44	@J	well, that would be possible, but not the most obvious use case
2014-04-27 14:45:01	@J	it's more like, both D and the right arrow key would do axis 1 right
2014-04-27 14:45:05	@Espyo	right
2014-04-27 14:45:10	@J	and also a gamepad's A-stick
2014-04-27 14:45:16	@Espyo	right
2014-04-27 14:45:41	@J	anyway, so like I said, you can map components between them
2014-04-27 14:46:19	@J	the mouse position has 4 components already (left, right, up, down), but maybe you only want to use 2 of them to track the horizontal axis
2014-04-27 14:46:46	@J	in that case, you map (left, right) to (left, right), ignoring up and down
2014-04-27 14:47:05	@J	I'm thinking of doing it like this: parent.add(child[child_components][parent_components])
2014-04-27 14:47:24	@J	like parent.add(child1, child2[0], child3[1:3], child4[:][0,2]), etc.
2014-04-27 14:47:39	@J	where the [] are Python's slice notation, which specifies which elements of something to extract
2014-04-27 14:48:04	@J	does that sound like it would make sense?  The part I'm not sure about is treating the parent components like they're a part of the child
2014-04-27 14:48:43	@Espyo	I'm not following at all
2014-04-27 14:48:47	@Espyo	like, the parents and childs
2014-04-27 14:48:51	@Espyo	I have no idea what even
2014-04-27 14:48:58	@Espyo	I get the Python things, though
2014-04-27 14:49:02	@J	you add an event to another
2014-04-27 14:49:11	@J	the one you add is the child, and you add it to the parent
2014-04-27 14:49:22	@J	a parent has any number of children
2014-04-27 14:49:34	@Espyo	so... let me get this straight
2014-04-27 14:49:39	@J	in the mouse example, the mouse is the child and the axis is the parent
2014-04-27 14:49:40	@Espyo	the parent is the axis 1 right
2014-04-27 14:49:48	@J	yes
2014-04-27 14:49:54	@Espyo	and the children are D, right arrow, and the analog stick
2014-04-27 14:49:57	@Espyo	from the example from before
2014-04-27 14:49:57	@J	yes
2014-04-27 14:50:03	@Espyo	all right, it's all coming together now
2014-04-27 14:50:05	@Espyo	but the names...
2014-04-27 14:50:15	@J	parent and child is pretty standard, isn't it?
2014-04-27 14:50:20	@Espyo	I would rather call the axis 1 right the event, and the physical keys the triggers
2014-04-27 14:50:27	@Espyo	like, one is what the game knows
2014-04-27 14:50:35	@Espyo	the game knows axis 1 right makes the character go right
2014-04-27 14:50:47	@Espyo	it doesn't care how you get the "axis 1 right happened" event to pull off
2014-04-27 14:50:48	@J	could do, except that an event is also a trigger
2014-04-27 14:50:54	@Espyo	and the others are physical keys, they all act differently
2014-04-27 14:50:57	@J	you can add it to other events as if it's a trigger
2014-04-27 14:51:23	@Espyo	like when the axis 1 right event is triggered, also trigger on_walk event?
2014-04-27 14:51:39	@J	not really
2014-04-27 14:51:53	@J	I can't really think of a sensible use case, just that it's possible
2014-04-27 14:53:30	@Espyo	but without one, I can't really understand
2014-04-27 14:53:37	@Espyo	but either way, with what I know so far
2014-04-27 14:53:43	@Espyo	the names should really be kinda different
2014-04-27 14:53:50	@Espyo	like, it's fine events can have child events
2014-04-27 14:53:54	@Espyo	however you're thinking of them
2014-04-27 14:53:55	@J	these aren't code names, they're explanation names
2014-04-27 14:54:10	@Espyo	but at the very least, the physical D key, the physical analog stick, the physical mouse movements
2014-04-27 14:54:13	@Espyo	those should be triggers
2014-04-27 14:54:23	@Espyo	because you cannot, EVER, trigger a D key "event"
2014-04-27 14:54:31	@Espyo	your D key isn't gonna push itself before your very eyes
2014-04-27 14:55:16	@J	simulation?  Testing?
2014-04-27 14:55:51	@J	either way, I would like to go back to the other day, when you said I should call inputs events
2014-04-27 14:56:19	@Espyo	that was just yesterday
2014-04-27 14:56:23	@Espyo	probably less than a day even
2014-04-27 14:56:30	@J	yesterday is the other day
2014-04-27 14:56:32	@Espyo	but hey, I had no idea how it worked back then
2014-04-27 14:56:46	@Espyo	you're the one who gave the greenlight
2014-04-27 14:56:49	@Espyo	no blaming me
2014-04-27 14:56:59	@Espyo	plus you'd have to blame Testyo first, he's my secretary
2014-04-27 14:57:23	@J	anyway, it's too late, everything is an event
2014-04-27 14:58:26	@J	I guess you can call the child a trigger, even though it might not be directly related to hardware inputs
2014-04-27 14:58:42	@J	an event is also a trigger, in that it can 'happen'
2014-04-27 15:00:23	@Espyo	right
2014-04-27 15:01:01	@J	[14:48:04] @J does that sound like it would make sense?  The part I'm not sure about is treating the parent components
2014-04-27 15:01:01	@J	like they're a part of the child
2014-04-27 15:01:05	@J	does that make sense yet?
2014-04-27 15:01:30	@J	uh...I mean, does the question as to whether it would make sense make sense?
2014-04-27 15:01:35	@Espyo	well, yeah, kinda
2014-04-27 15:01:38	@J	okay, now I'm a little confused
2014-04-27 15:01:42	@Espyo	hm, wait
2014-04-27 15:01:49	@Espyo	you mean parents OWN the children?
2014-04-27 15:01:54	@J	yes
2014-04-27 15:01:55	@Espyo	like the children only exist inside the parents?
2014-04-27 15:02:02	@Espyo	and not, you know, as a thing that can be linked?
2014-04-27 15:02:11	@J	in fact, Event is a subclass of Owned, which is a thing that can be owned
2014-04-27 15:02:22	@J	linked?
2014-04-27 15:02:46	@Espyo	all right, we'll get nowhere without me understanding a concrete example of this parenting thing
2014-04-27 15:02:52	@Espyo	you sure you're not overcomplicating this?
2014-04-27 15:02:54	@J	heh
2014-04-27 15:02:58	@J	okay, I should write one
2014-04-27 15:03:05	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2014-04-27 15:07:28	@J	http://sprunge.us/LOPN?py
2014-04-27 15:08:12	@J	a little bit dumbed-down/simplified
2014-04-27 15:08:17	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2014-04-27 15:08:35	@Espyo	see, but that's the whole thing, making wasd and such an "event"...
2014-04-27 15:08:39	@Espyo	the problem might just be a misnomer
2014-04-27 15:08:43	@Espyo	now I get why you wanted input
2014-04-27 15:08:51	@Espyo	but I don't think there's really a word
2014-04-27 15:08:55	@Espyo	they're just... different things
2014-04-27 15:09:03	@Espyo	even though I do see how they connect
2014-04-27 15:09:07	@Espyo	they just can't really be called the same
2014-04-27 15:09:10	@Espyo	but hey, you know what
2014-04-27 15:09:16	@Espyo	in cases like these, just use the catch-all term:
2014-04-27 15:09:16	@Espyo	node
2014-04-27 15:09:43	@J	but here's the thing: crazier_button = Button(components=2).add(crazy_axis[LEFT, RIGHT])
2014-04-27 15:10:48	@J	but anyway, forget what they're called - event is just a name, and none of that code uses the word 'event'
2014-04-27 15:11:40	@J	BTW, [:] means get everything
2014-04-27 15:12:20	@Espyo	right, right
2014-04-27 15:12:32	@Espyo	hm, I see what you mean now
2014-04-27 15:12:58	@Espyo	all right, so the question again?
2014-04-27 15:14:12	@J	does that seems like a sensible way to do the component mapping?

2014-04-27 15:14:35	@J	I'm not really sure about how it makes it look like the parent components are an aspect of the child
2014-04-27 15:14:46	@J	'the event components are an aspect of the trigger'
2014-04-27 15:14:57	@J	really, they're an aspect of _adding_ the child to the parent
2014-04-27 15:15:01	@J	not the child itself
2014-04-27 15:15:43	@J	also, I should probably know better by now, but I honestly thought this idea wouldn't take long to communicate
2014-04-27 15:18:26	@Espyo	yeah, exactly...
2014-04-27 15:18:30	@Espyo	a component of adding
2014-04-27 15:18:52	@Espyo	that's what happens when you call a rabbit a Smeerp
2014-04-27 15:19:15	@J	wha

2014-04-27 19:32:31	@PikFan	" As you are all aware, Pikmin Fanon, in general, a low-quality wiki. We do have our quality pages, but low-quality far outnumber these pages. In the past, we have tried to initiate changes to the wiki, but the lack of users here have impeded those campaigns.  Espyo and I have talked on the chatroom about Pikmin Fanon's messiness. We must converge and improve
2014-04-27 19:32:48	@PikFan	the wiki in any way, be it simply fixing an article to creating an advanced Help Page. We cannot put this off any longer: it is time to revive Pikmin Fanon, and make it better than ever before. Below are the ideas that Espyo came up with: "
2014-04-27 19:33:28	@PikFan	err, I meant "is a low-quality wiki"
2014-04-27 19:33:37	@J	converge?

2014-04-27 19:33:40	@J	you and Espyo?
2014-04-27 19:34:01	@PikFan	no, all the users on Fanon
2014-04-27 19:34:08	@Espyo	oh, you corrected
2014-04-27 19:34:14	@PikFan	maybe "we all"
2014-04-27 19:34:14	@J	...converge on what?
2014-04-27 19:34:21	@Espyo	yeah, not sure "converge" is the word
2014-04-27 19:34:24	@Espyo	we're not a function
2014-04-27 19:34:32	@PikFan	come together?
2014-04-27 19:34:39	@Espyo	that's probably the best
2014-04-27 19:34:55	@Espyo	maybe you should point out that this is for the sake of Fanon, Pikipedia, the engine, and Pikmin fandom as a whole
2014-04-27 19:36:53	@PikFan	not sure how this will effect the entirety of Pikmin fandom
2014-04-27 19:40:39	@Espyo	more fans will come about
2014-04-27 19:40:42	@Espyo	that was half of the whole point
2014-04-27 19:40:50	@Espyo	making Fanon a better place to be so that newcomers can at least exist
2014-04-27 19:41:08	@Espyo	instead of going "man, I should make a game for that engin— never mind, I want to get away as possible from that horrible wiki"
2014-04-27 19:41:41	@PikFan	the problem is, there will always be those users who make an account and never use it
2014-04-27 19:41:49	@Espyo	maybe because of that
2014-04-27 19:41:54	@Espyo	at the surface, they want to be here
2014-04-27 19:41:58	@Espyo	so they create an account
2014-04-27 19:42:02	@Espyo	but once they see around, they think again
2014-04-27 19:45:05	@PikFan	gaaaah, where is that topic

2014-04-27 19:47:44	@PikFan	GAH
2014-04-27 19:47:55	@PikFan	right, but they're relevant
2014-04-27 19:48:19	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-04-27 19:48:41	@Espyo	>All bullet lists should be in alphebetical order and paragraph lists should be in alphebetical order or another organized and specific order.
2014-04-27 19:48:44	@Espyo	huge asterisk
2014-04-27 19:48:54	@Espyo	there are a lot of lists that make no sense to be alphabetized
2014-04-27 19:48:59	@Espyo	also alphabetical
2014-04-27 19:50:04	@PikFan	but yeah, I put those links down at the bottom

2014-04-27 20:28:17	@Espyo	we're just giving the people a week to come up with suggestions
2014-04-27 20:28:22	@PikFan	...
2014-04-27 20:28:29	@PikFan	I thought you told me to save it
2014-04-27 20:28:32	@PikFan	and I just did
2014-04-27 20:28:46	@PikFan	oh well
2014-04-27 20:29:50	@Espyo	"save"?
2014-04-27 20:30:36	@PikFan	never mind
2014-04-27 20:30:50	@PikFan	what will happen to those who don't adhere to the changes?
2014-04-27 20:31:05	@Espyo	well, as for users, they get the treatment they would in any other wiki
2014-04-27 20:31:08	@Espyo	warnings on talk pages
2014-04-27 20:31:16	@Espyo	and if they keep going at it, a temporary ban
2014-04-27 20:31:25	@Espyo	and if they persist, permanent ban
2014-04-27 20:31:37	@Espyo	although a bit less strict
2014-04-27 20:31:51	@Espyo	as for pages, old pages have to be cleaned up, new pages have to adhere, or else what I said before
2014-04-27 20:32:07	@PikFan	"IMPORTANT: We are giving the community one week to discuss the changes. After one week has passed, we will begin implementing these changes. Those who do not follow will receive warnings on their talk pages."

2014-04-27 20:34:54	@Espyo	scratch the "probably"
2014-04-27 20:34:59	@Espyo	oh, one thing
2014-04-27 20:35:08	@Espyo	I made the page not include a TOC because it'd break my page examples
2014-04-27 20:35:16	@Espyo	so add links to the comments and other links sections
2014-04-27 20:35:18	@PikFan	mm

2014-04-27 20:51:45	@Espyo	tab won't work
2014-04-27 20:51:49	@Espyo	you might have to use a div

2014-04-27 21:43:38	@Espyo	the TOC wasn't meant to exist because it thought that the sections on my example pages were meant to exist

2014-04-27 22:44:21	@Espyo	you have some edits to patrol on Pikipedia
2014-04-27 22:45:01	Spark	hey espy in C++ is there a way to name a variable the contents of another variable?
2014-04-27 22:46:29	Spark	for example: char * x ="name" and i want to name another variable "name", how could i do that
2014-04-27 22:49:36	@Espyo	you can't
2014-04-27 22:49:48	@Espyo	there are a few ways to do what you want, though
2014-04-27 22:49:49	@Espyo	kinda
2014-04-27 22:49:59	@Espyo	if you can give me a better example...
2014-04-27 22:50:11	@Espyo	also call my full nick next time so that I get a beep notification
2014-04-27 22:50:18	Spark	oh okay
2014-04-27 22:50:27	Spark	and what do you mean? that example pretty much explains what i want to do
2014-04-27 22:50:53	Spark	im getting a string from irc for my bot
2014-04-27 22:51:08	@Espyo	still too vague
2014-04-27 22:51:10	Spark	and i want it to store a variable under someone's name
2014-04-27 22:51:30	Spark	like uhh
2014-04-27 22:52:38	Spark	http://mibpaste.com/glv0RP 
2014-04-27 22:53:12	Spark	except it would use espyo.money, or spark.money instead of nick.money
2014-04-27 22:54:04	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-04-27 22:54:19	@Espyo	so if I say "!points", it outputs espyo.points?
2014-04-27 22:54:27	@Espyo	oh wait
2014-04-27 22:54:28	Spark	yeah
2014-04-27 22:54:31	@Espyo	didn't read your last one
2014-04-27 22:54:37	@Espyo	hm, you probably want to save the nicknames in a map
2014-04-27 22:54:42	@Espyo	do #include <map> at the top
2014-04-27 22:54:59	Spark	is there no way to do it from scratch?
2014-04-27 22:55:02	@Espyo	a map is like a vector, but you can access stuff by name
2014-04-27 22:55:14	@Espyo	nope

2014-04-27 23:04:02	Spark	in theory wouldnt it work to use a pointer
2014-04-27 23:04:38	@Espyo	err...
2014-04-27 23:04:39	@Espyo	no?
2014-04-27 23:05:10	Spark	maybe im overthinking it then >.<
2014-04-27 23:05:18	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-27 23:06:19	Spark	but there must be some internal code in maps that does what i want to do
2014-04-27 23:09:37	Spark	i mean inside of map.h it must be basically doing what i want to do
2014-04-27 23:10:25	@Espyo	J: your thing doesn't work :|
2014-04-27 23:10:38	@Espyo	Spark: I doubt it...

2014-04-27 23:12:12	Spark	now my ocd will let me use maps

2014-04-28 01:05:51	@Espyo	pretty smart
2014-04-28 01:06:08	@Espyo	if you go to The Distant Spring, and you walk about in an area with a lot of water
2014-04-28 01:06:21	@Espyo	you can see the reflection of leaves in the distance, on the water
2014-04-28 01:06:29	@Espyo	how they managed that is surprisingly tricky
2014-04-28 01:06:45	@Espyo	the leaf shadows actually exist under the map, in this whiteish bowl
2014-04-28 01:06:53	@Espyo	and the ground under the water is actually see-through
2014-04-28 01:06:56	@PikFan	huh
2014-04-28 01:07:01	@PikFan	interesting
2014-04-28 01:07:04	@Espyo	so when you look at the water, you're not seeing a reflection of the leaves up above
2014-04-28 01:07:15	@Espyo	you're actually seeing through the floor, some painted leaf shadows on an underground bowl
2014-04-28 01:07:53	@PikFan	so the ground is glass, then?
2014-04-28 01:07:59	@PikFan	lol

2014-04-28 15:45:47	@PikFan	ok I don't know why Firefox likes to open up the last window I closed when I start Firefox
2014-04-28 15:46:23	@PikFan	bah, technology is confusing

2014-04-28 20:02:07	@J	hey, does GitHub work for you in Firefox?
2014-04-28 20:02:15	@J	all the things stopped working for me recently
2014-04-28 20:02:20	@J	like the user page activity indicator
2014-04-28 20:02:32	@J	and the coloured bar thing you click to show language usage
2014-04-28 20:02:49	@J	and changing the clone URL
2014-04-28 20:04:02	@J	and if you go to a user's repositories, the filtering links at the top-right
2014-04-28 20:04:48	@Espyo	should work, always did
2014-04-28 20:05:19	@Espyo	user page activity indicator... now if I knew what that is for certain...
2014-04-28 20:05:29	@Espyo	oh, doesn't help that I'm logged out
2014-04-28 20:06:24	@J	that's the grid of green squares on a user page
2014-04-28 20:06:37	@J	I see nothing in Firefox, works in Chromium and Midori
2014-04-28 20:06:38	@Espyo	I see no language bar
2014-04-28 20:06:48	@Espyo	oh, the one with the contributions?
2014-04-28 20:06:53	@Espyo	charts commits per day and all
2014-04-28 20:06:58	@Espyo	I see that just fine
2014-04-28 20:07:11	@J	oh, huh
2014-04-28 20:07:19	@J	it's just my Firefox profile, another works fine
2014-04-28 20:07:24	@Espyo	weird
2014-04-28 20:07:26	@J	I tried enabling cookies, so it's not that
2014-04-28 20:07:29	@J	must be an addon?
2014-04-28 20:07:37	@Espyo	adblock, stylish?
2014-04-28 20:07:46	@Espyo	don't you have that addon that disables JS until you enable it?
2014-04-28 20:07:51	@Espyo	or is that Flash?
2014-04-28 20:08:26	@J	I have Flashblock, no JS blocking
2014-04-28 20:09:23	@J	http://i.imgur.com/gxm1vtW.png
2014-04-28 20:09:45	@Espyo	uh
2014-04-28 20:09:49	@Espyo	there's already a setting to disable the menu bar
2014-04-28 20:09:58	@J	no, this shows it again if you press alt
2014-04-28 20:09:59	@Espyo	well, it's the one with the orange "Firefox" on the corner
2014-04-28 20:10:02	@Espyo	might be windows only
2014-04-28 20:10:04	@Espyo	that happens already
2014-04-28 20:10:08	@Espyo	I just pressed Alt
2014-04-28 20:10:10	@J	hmm, really?
2014-04-28 20:10:10	@Espyo	it just appeared
2014-04-28 20:10:13	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-28 20:10:18	@J	what does it look like while hidden?
2014-04-28 20:10:32	@Espyo	...hidden
2014-04-28 20:10:33	@Espyo	:|
2014-04-28 20:10:44	@Espyo	Linkification could be the problem
2014-04-28 20:11:10	@J	where's the option?
2014-04-28 20:11:38	@J	wow, you're right
2014-04-28 20:11:46	@J	why would Linkification do that?
2014-04-28 20:12:06	@J	uh...what
2014-04-28 20:12:12	@J	okay, I re-enabled it and it still works
2014-04-28 20:12:25	@J	well, no need to work out why...
2014-04-28 20:12:26	@Espyo	which "it"?
2014-04-28 20:12:53	@J	Linkification
2014-04-28 20:13:25	@Espyo	all right, now define the other "it"
2014-04-28 20:13:29	@Espyo	I actually wanted you to define both
2014-04-28 20:14:14	@Espyo	uh, I should use Vacuum Places
2014-04-28 20:14:25	@Espyo	ever had any problems with it?
2014-04-28 20:14:39	@Espyo	I mean, my entire history and everything suddenly exploding really doesn't seem like a great idea
2014-04-28 20:16:46	@J	GitHub still works
2014-04-28 20:16:56	@J	[20:14:25] @Espyo ever had any problems with it?
2014-04-28 20:16:58	@J	none at all
2014-04-28 20:17:19	@Espyo	the reviews are scaring me, though
2014-04-28 20:17:29	@J	I just have it set to clean every 30 restarts (which is generally every 30 days)
2014-04-28 20:17:29	@Espyo	they range from "can't feel a difference" to "my everything is gone!"
2014-04-28 20:17:53	@J	because the larger proportion of people for whom it worked perfectly felt no need to review it?
2014-04-28 20:18:13	@J	this is also Vacuum Places Improved
2014-04-28 20:18:32	@J	I assume that means there's also a (different) Vacuum Places
2014-04-28 20:18:33	@Espyo	yes, I was reading the one for Improved
2014-04-28 20:18:46	@Espyo	and apparently Firefox already does vacuum up your places.sqlite
2014-04-28 20:18:56	@Espyo	one of the comments said so, and linked to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512854
2014-04-28 20:19:07	@Espyo	plus I searched "vacu" on about:config
2014-04-28 20:19:10	@Espyo	and got pretty reassuring stuff
2014-04-28 20:19:56	@J	I don't see much in the reviews about deleting stuff
2014-04-28 20:20:17	@J	hmm, maybe I don't need it any more, then
2014-04-28 20:20:33	@J	I installed it years ago
2014-04-28 20:20:42	@Espyo	 2011
2014-04-28 20:20:51	@Espyo	is when it started becoming an in-browser thing
2014-04-28 20:20:51	@Espyo	meh
2014-04-28 20:21:03	@Espyo	maybe that's where the Improved comes in
2014-04-28 20:21:11	@Espyo	like, it adds custom intervals, reminders, etc.
2014-04-28 20:21:16	@Espyo	compared to the native cleaner
2014-04-28 20:22:42	@J	looked at about:config, there's a places.last_vacuum
2014-04-28 20:22:52	@J	but the timestamp corresponds to 2011...
2014-04-28 20:23:55	@J	wait
2014-04-28 20:23:57	@J	but there's 
2014-04-28 20:24:03	@J	storage.vacuum.last.places.sqlite;1397152074
2014-04-28 20:24:07	@J	do you have both of these?
2014-04-28 20:24:16	@J	(that's more like 10th April)
2014-04-28 20:26:23	@Espyo	yeah, I have both
2014-04-28 20:26:39	@Espyo	places.last_vacuum = 1295645923
2014-04-28 20:27:58	@J	that's almost the same as mine
2014-04-28 20:28:03	@J	and the other is more recent?
2014-04-28 20:28:06	@J	if so, I guess it is working
2014-04-28 20:28:30	@J	I have one for Brief's database too
2014-04-28 20:32:00	@J	BTW, why would you say you use Firefox?
2014-04-28 20:32:15	@J	just wondering, since more people (especially developers) seem to use Chrome/Chromium now
2014-04-28 20:34:31	@Espyo	uh, yeah, one for Brief as well
2014-04-28 20:34:46	@Espyo	I don't do much web development, but when I do, I go back and forth between FF and Chrome
2014-04-28 20:34:53	@Espyo	but overall, I just like the coziness Firefox provides
2014-04-28 20:34:58	@Espyo	and the addons are more of my taste
2014-04-28 20:35:05	@Espyo	like FireGestures and Adblock
2014-04-28 20:35:18	@Espyo	Chrome's Adblock is all sponsored and affiliated with the NSA or something
2014-04-28 20:35:24	@J	...really?
2014-04-28 20:35:39	@Espyo	and Chrome's FireGestures is less flexible, and stupidly, doesn't work on on-disk HTML pages
2014-04-28 20:35:45	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-28 20:35:49	@J	I would be surprised that if that is the case, there isn't another community-developed one
2014-04-28 20:35:49	@Espyo	also: Personas
2014-04-28 20:35:54	@Espyo	I only use one, but I really love it
2014-04-28 20:36:03	@Espyo	yeah, that's the weirdest: there isn't
2014-04-28 20:36:06	@Espyo	not as far as I know, at least
2014-04-28 20:36:16	@Espyo	I think the sponsored thing flies under the radar of most people
2014-04-28 20:36:22	@Espyo	mind that that's just what I heard
2014-04-28 20:36:29	@Espyo	afaik, it's actually like Firefox'
2014-04-28 20:36:35	@J	it's not like it would even need much maintenance: the Firefox Adblock maintains an open list of blocking rules, so it could just use that
2014-04-28 20:36:40	@Espyo	Firefox' does have some sponsored lists, that whitelist some websites
2014-04-28 20:36:49	@Espyo	but that's 100% optional
2014-04-28 20:36:56	@Espyo	both the whitelisting and forcing you to use specific lists
2014-04-28 20:37:01	@J	I wouldn't call those sponsored
2014-04-28 20:37:08	@Espyo	can't figure out a better name
2014-04-28 20:37:21	@J	sponsored means the sites on it are paying them to be on there
2014-04-28 20:37:49	@J	but they're clearly fairly small sites that have just been found by the community to have unintrusive adverts
2014-04-28 20:37:57	@J	last I looked, anyway
2014-04-28 20:38:03	@Espyo	sure, if you want to use the /correct/ definition of "sponsored"
2014-04-28 20:38:18	@Espyo	anyway, I'm not too sure on the details
2014-04-28 20:38:35	@Espyo	there was a big scandal about it some months ago, but I forgot most of it
2014-04-28 20:38:38	@J	hmm, okay
2014-04-28 20:38:47	@J	not really sure what you mean about 'coziness'
2014-04-28 20:39:07	@Espyo	user-friendliness, and the fact that Firefox is all about browsing the web your way
2014-04-28 20:39:13	@Espyo	from the expansive about:config to the addons
2014-04-28 20:39:16	@J	I tried mouse guestures (not just browser-based) once, many years ago, and decided I didn't like it
2014-04-28 20:39:24	@Espyo	I can't live without it
2014-04-28 20:39:30	@J	but I use Firefox for the interface customisation
2014-04-28 20:39:35	@Espyo	I close like 100+ tabs a day
2014-04-28 20:39:39	@J	AFAICT, that's the one real thing Chrome lacks
2014-04-28 20:39:47	@Espyo	and having to carefully aim at the little cross on the tab is horrible
2014-04-28 20:39:51	@Espyo	I just drag the RMB down
2014-04-28 20:39:52	@Espyo	done
2014-04-28 20:39:53	@J	ctrl-w?
2014-04-28 20:40:03	@Espyo	but my other hand is on my lap
2014-04-28 20:40:06	@Espyo	under my armpit
2014-04-28 20:40:16	@Espyo	or what have you
2014-04-28 20:40:16	@J	when I say I don't like mouse guestures, I mean I don't like the mouse
2014-04-28 20:40:29	@J	...wait, how is your armpit near your lap?
2014-04-28 20:40:33	@Espyo	I... didn't imply
2014-04-28 20:40:37	@Espyo	no, those are different things
2014-04-28 20:40:42	@Espyo	either armpit or lap
2014-04-28 20:40:48	@J	suuure
2014-04-28 20:40:53	@Espyo	hey, I could always be hunching on my bed
2014-04-28 20:40:56	@Espyo	err, somehow
2014-04-28 20:41:23	@J	moving on
2014-04-28 20:41:42	@Espyo	oh, also, you should probably use Digest, not Brief
2014-04-28 20:43:53	@J	it doesn't seem to exist
2014-04-28 20:44:41	@Espyo	:|
2014-04-28 20:44:56	@Espyo	https://github.com/Tanriol/digest
2014-04-28 20:45:03	@Espyo	that's the link I get on about:addons
2014-04-28 20:45:13	@Espyo	this one's also been abandoned
2014-04-28 20:45:22	@Espyo	it's still got some tiny flaws, but it improves on Brief
2014-04-28 20:45:44	@Espyo	off the top of my head: if it fetches new items while you have a Brief tab open, it no longer glitches
2014-04-28 20:45:55	@Espyo	like, on Brief, if you had a tab open, and it got a new item, you couldn't mark as read any more
2014-04-28 20:46:02	@Espyo	that now almost never happens with Digest
2014-04-28 20:46:09	@Espyo	I think I might've seen it once or twice, but it's rare
2014-04-28 20:46:13	@Espyo	it's also faster overall
2014-04-28 20:46:51	@J	'also'?
2014-04-28 20:47:07	@J	never seen that happen with Brief
2014-04-28 20:47:19	@Espyo	maybe you never had a tab open while it fetched
2014-04-28 20:47:23	@Espyo	or maybe it was just a me thing
2014-04-28 20:47:29	@J	why is it not on the Firefox addons site?
2014-04-28 20:47:34	@Espyo	no idea...
2014-04-28 20:47:36	@Espyo	might've been taken out
2014-04-28 20:47:43	@J	yeah, I mean, if it even did happen, I never noticed
2014-04-28 20:48:03	@Espyo	one annoying thing that happens on both Brief and Digest is that the fetch time kinda shifts over tie
2014-04-28 20:48:05	@Espyo	*time
2014-04-28 20:48:17	@J	anyway, you suggested Brief has been abandoned
2014-04-28 20:48:18	@Espyo	I have it set to fetch from some of the more active feeds 3 times a day
2014-04-28 20:48:22	@Espyo	err, once every 8 hours or something
2014-04-28 20:48:25	@J	hmm, interesting point
2014-04-28 20:48:27	@Espyo	and have the rest be fetched once a day
2014-04-28 20:48:47	@Espyo	when I was starting, I set it to fetch at... uh, midday, was it?
2014-04-28 20:48:50	@J	not really something I care for, but I can see why you'd want to do time-based fetching
2014-04-28 20:48:58	@Espyo	after some weeks, it was fetching the daily feeds at like 7 PM
2014-04-28 20:49:05	@J	I'll add it to the feature list of the feed reader I'll never make
2014-04-28 20:49:12	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-28 20:49:19	@Espyo	right now, I don't really care when it fetches
2014-04-28 20:49:27	@Espyo	so long as I have stuff to watch every few hours
2014-04-28 20:49:33	@Espyo	VS takes ages to compile
2014-04-28 20:49:36	@Espyo	so while I wait, I read my feeds
2014-04-28 20:49:43	@Espyo	THAT's micromanagement
2014-04-28 20:49:50	@J	why does it matter when it happens, then?
2014-04-28 20:49:57	@Espyo	it used to
2014-04-28 20:49:58	@J	I mean, why does it bother you that the time shifted?
2014-04-28 20:50:03	@Espyo	year-ago me used to care
2014-04-28 20:50:06	@Espyo	current me doesn't
2014-04-28 20:50:12	@Espyo	don't ask me why, I don't know any more
2014-04-28 20:50:22	@Espyo	maybe I had set it to a time where...
2014-04-28 20:50:22	@Espyo	hmm
2014-04-28 20:50:35	@Espyo	I think it was back when my classes weren't just all over the place
2014-04-28 20:50:41	@Espyo	and I came home at like 7
2014-04-28 20:50:52	@Espyo	and took care of my feeds, youtube videos, etc.
2014-04-28 20:50:54	@Espyo	daily stuff
2014-04-28 20:50:55	@J	but yeah, for sites that have a schedule, you could set it to fetch on Wednesdays or something
2014-04-28 20:51:04	@Espyo	so I guess I used to like having it every day on the dot
2014-04-28 20:51:10	@Espyo	yeah, that too
2014-04-28 20:51:13	@Espyo	in fact, come to think of it
2014-04-28 20:51:25	@Espyo	I used to have some fetch like once a week or so
2014-04-28 20:51:39	@Espyo	(never bothered to check the exact days some sites release stuff)
2014-04-28 20:51:49	@Espyo	((uh, that sentence = schedules))
2014-04-28 20:51:56	@Espyo	but I eventually just made it search once a day
2014-04-28 20:52:11	@Espyo	uh, I kinda zoned out for a bit
2014-04-28 20:52:18	@Espyo	so never mind if one of the things I wrote is in Engrish
2014-04-28 20:52:28	@J	I have some that I don't really expect to see anything on, but want to check just in case, so I just set it to a monthly check or something
2014-04-28 20:52:55	@Espyo	right
2014-04-28 20:53:01	@Espyo	I just lazied out and made everything daily
2014-04-28 20:53:07	@Espyo	well, except for the stuff that updates really often

2014-04-28 22:29:13	@J	okay, so I have another event problem
2014-04-28 22:29:19	@J	may be even more confusing
2014-04-28 22:29:29	@J	so, button modifiers
2014-04-28 22:29:38	@Espyo	dammit windows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aTCOIryS7Y
2014-04-28 22:29:50	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-04-28 22:30:11	@Espyo	can't really see anything wrong with modifiers
2014-04-28 22:30:49	@J	that's great
2014-04-28 22:31:00	@J	so, say you have just one device, let's say a keyboard
2014-04-28 22:31:35	@J	say you have 3 shortcuts: A, ctrl-A and alt-A
2014-04-28 22:32:04	@J	clearly, pressing ctrl-A and alt-A shouldn't trigger A
2014-04-28 22:32:10	@J	but shift-A should trigger A
2014-04-28 22:32:18	@J	and shift-ctrl-A should trigger ctrl-A
2014-04-28 22:32:30	@J	because shift isn't used anywhere as a modifier
2014-04-28 22:33:23	@Espyo	mhm
2014-04-28 22:33:32	@Espyo	not normally how it works, but I see what you mean
2014-04-28 22:33:41	@J	introduce another device, say a gamepad
2014-04-28 22:34:10	@Espyo	yes?
2014-04-28 22:34:20	@J	add the shortcuts A-button, and A-button while holding the left trigger
2014-04-28 22:34:51	@Espyo	oh, "A" is ambiguous?
2014-04-28 22:35:12	@J	it is while I'm talking about it, but that's not my problem
2014-04-28 22:35:31	@J	now, it's clear that LT-A while holding RT should trigger LT-A but not A
2014-04-28 22:35:39	@J	because RT is not a modifier
2014-04-28 22:35:56	@Espyo	oh, good
2014-04-28 22:36:06	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-28 22:36:14	@J	but ctrl, even though it's a modifier, shouldn't interfere
2014-04-28 22:36:32	@J	so, we need to only look at known modifiers for the device you're using
2014-04-28 22:36:49	@J	(except you might want keyboard/mouse to mix up, like ctrl-LMB, but that's a different problem)
2014-04-28 22:36:56	@Espyo	why not make anything a modifier?
2014-04-28 22:37:05	@J	any button
2014-04-28 22:37:15	@J	(LT can be treated as a button)
2014-04-28 22:37:34	@J	now, the problem is with combinations of inputs
2014-04-28 22:37:41	@J	ctrl = lctrl + rctrl
2014-04-28 22:37:48	@J	for example
2014-04-28 22:38:19	@J	do you treat this as a separate modifier, or do you treat it as two, for the purposes of interference with other modifiers?
2014-04-28 22:39:41	@Espyo	oh
2014-04-28 22:39:42	@Espyo	hmm
2014-04-28 22:40:01	@Espyo	Allegro recognizes them as different keys, but treats them as the same modifier
2014-04-28 22:40:06	@Espyo	you should have it be an option
2014-04-28 22:40:16	@Espyo	hmm, I can think of something
2014-04-28 22:40:18	@J	what do you mean?
2014-04-28 22:40:41	@Espyo	when a key is pressed, you can get the key identifier and the modifiers
2014-04-28 22:41:01	@Espyo	rather, the key id or the key's resulting unicode character + modifiers
2014-04-28 22:41:08	@Espyo	you pick whichever you want
2014-04-28 22:41:15	@J	that's a different concept, really
2014-04-28 22:41:20	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-04-28 22:41:30	@Espyo	but I mean, you should make it so that you can set modifier aliases
2014-04-28 22:41:34	@J	what it's doing is only considering the 'special' modifiers: ctrl, shift, alt, super
2014-04-28 22:41:39	@Espyo	RCtrl and LCtrl being an alias of Ctrl
2014-04-28 22:41:50	@Espyo	I once bought a GameCube controller that had two Z buttons
2014-04-28 22:41:52	@Espyo	both mapped to the same
2014-04-28 22:41:56	@J	that's not the issue
2014-04-28 22:42:01	@Espyo	what then?
2014-04-28 22:42:19	@J	it's easy to define ctrl as meaning either lctrl or rctrl is pressed
2014-04-28 22:42:34	@Espyo	I was hoping it'd be
2014-04-28 22:42:41	@J	but how does this work WRT the interference between mods I was describing
2014-04-28 22:42:47	@J	let me try to come up with an example
2014-04-28 22:43:09	@J	(forgot a ? there)
2014-04-28 22:43:59	@J	okay, so, say you register shortcuts ctrl-A and lctrl-A
2014-04-28 22:44:11	@J	where ctrl = lctrl | rctrl
2014-04-28 22:44:22	@J	if you press lctrl-A, both get triggered
2014-04-28 22:44:32	@J	if you press rctrl-A, only ctrl-A gets triggered
2014-04-28 22:44:44	@J	what if you press lctrl-rctrl-A?
2014-04-28 22:44:55	@J	clearly ctrl-A gets triggered, but what about lctrl-A?
2014-04-28 22:45:29	@J	this probably sounds crazy, but I'm sure there are situations where it actually matters
2014-04-28 22:46:26	@J	what I mean is, you're pressing a modifier key (rctrl) that is used as a modifier in another shortcut (ctrl-A)
2014-04-28 22:46:50	@J	before, we decided that this would exclude lctrl-A from being activated
2014-04-28 22:46:54	@J	but it seems wrong here
2014-04-28 22:47:48	@J	I would say, no, lctrl-A doesn't get activated
2014-04-28 22:48:09	@J	but there are even more complicated situations, where your modifier isn't a simple OR-combination of inputs
2014-04-28 22:48:24	@J	it might be an inversion: this key only works when ctrl _isn't_ pressed
2014-04-28 22:48:54	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-04-28 22:49:12	@J	so I guess my question is: can you think of an exclusion scheme that makes sense for _any_ possible way of combining inputs into a modifier
2014-04-28 22:49:24	@Espyo	yeah, it should trigger both, shouldn't it
2014-04-28 22:49:25	@J	if not, I guess I should just heavily restrict the sorts of combinations you can do
2014-04-28 22:49:28	@Espyo	but it contradicts
2014-04-28 22:49:59	@J	maybe only allow transforms (which is just reinterpreting an input as a different type of input, eg. an axis as a button)
2014-04-28 22:50:07	@Espyo	hm
2014-04-28 22:50:16	@Espyo	just sounds like overcomplication
2014-04-28 22:50:20	@J	uh, plus OR-combinations, I guess; that's pretty important
2014-04-28 22:50:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-28 22:50:29	@J	it does, but I don't want to get it wrong
2014-04-28 22:50:53	@J	I've tried a simple approach at this a few times, and there are always weird situations where it doesn't do what I expect
2014-04-28 22:52:23	@J	in the current version of my event system, it's just restricted: the only modifiers implemented are inputs which map directly to hardware inputs (button, axis, whatever), plus the special combinations: ctrl, alt, shift, super
2014-04-28 22:52:49	@Espyo	right
2014-04-28 22:52:54	@Espyo	but it should be more complex
2014-04-28 22:52:59	@Espyo	...without being overcomplicated
2014-04-28 22:53:01	@J	and you can tell how I thought about that by the fact that the special combinations are called '_SneakyKbdMultiKey'
2014-04-28 22:53:09	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-28 22:53:20	@J	by which you mean flexible but intelligent, I guess
2014-04-28 22:53:56	@J	does what you want but lets you do a lot
2014-04-28 22:54:10	@Espyo	more like flexible and senseful
2014-04-28 22:54:17	@J	*sensible?
2014-04-28 22:56:29	@Espyo	heh, I tried that
2014-04-28 22:56:35	@Espyo	but I meant more like the opposite of senseless
2014-04-28 22:56:52	@J	that is sensible, isn't it?
2014-04-28 22:57:50	@Espyo	not really?
2014-04-28 22:58:05	@Espyo	or, I guess sensible is senseful, but senseful is not sensible
2014-04-28 22:58:08	@Espyo	why isn't senseful a word dammit
2014-04-28 22:58:40	@J	...
2014-04-28 22:58:47	@J	anyway, if you have any ideas, let me know
2014-04-28 22:59:52	@J	I'm thinking that allowing AND, OR and transforming combinations of hardware inputs should be easy enough, and you probably wouldn't want to do more than that
2014-04-28 23:00:50	@Espyo	yeah, but that's just it, it's starting to overcomplicate
2014-04-28 23:01:06	@Espyo	is it at least easy to use stuff without the masks and such?
2014-04-28 23:01:17	@J	masks?
2014-04-28 23:02:40	@J	wait, I mean, I'm already doing AND, OR, etc., I'm just talking now about allowing those to be used as modifiers

2014-04-28 23:13:17	@J	not sure what you mean by asking whether it's easy
2014-04-28 23:14:02	@J	haven't redesigned the interfaces yet, but I guess just adding something basic would be, eg. KbdKey(pygame.K_a)
2014-04-28 23:14:50	@J	with modifiers: KbdKey(pygame.K_a, mods=(ButtonsAny(KbdKey(pygame.K_LCTRL), KbdKey(pygame.K_RCTRL))))
2014-04-28 23:15:07	@J	not that you would really do it like that - I'll have a configuration file like before
2014-04-28 23:15:21	@Espyo	hm, like
2014-04-28 23:15:30	@Espyo	you have to go out of your way to customize modifier interactions, right?
2014-04-28 23:15:34	@J	with aliases and shortcuts for commonly used things like ctrl
2014-04-28 23:15:38	@Espyo	you have to specify them on purpose
2014-04-28 23:16:22	@J	I wasn't really planning on making the interference behaviour customisable
2014-04-28 23:16:27	@J	it should just do what you want
2014-04-28 23:16:43	@J	which is why I need to come up with a good way to do it

2014-04-28 23:20:16	@J	it's just that it would also be nice for you to not have to care about anything else in the complicated cases: 'I want this event to be triggered by double-tapping the A-stick right, holding it there, and pressing the right trigger'

2014-04-28 23:26:35	@J	okay, and now I just realised I might actually want to provide somethings for 'common' remappings of button events: treat down as a down/up toggle, treat double-press as down, invert the button
2014-04-28 23:27:01	@Espyo	invert?
2014-04-28 23:27:09	@J	the 2nd one is like laptop touchpads, when you grab and drop something
2014-04-28 23:27:18	@J	push the button to release it
2014-04-28 23:27:23	@Espyo	ah
2014-04-28 23:27:28	@Espyo	it's just the way you called it
2014-04-28 23:27:53	@J	would triple-click be useful?

2014-04-28 23:29:22	@Espyo	triple-click is one of those things that's never useful
2014-04-28 23:29:25	@Espyo	...until you need it
2014-04-28 23:29:33	@Espyo	oh, I know a triple click thing
2014-04-28 23:29:37	@Espyo	selecting the entire sentence on a textbox

2014-04-28 23:30:30	@J	yes
2014-04-28 23:30:45	@J	or line in non-editable text
2014-04-28 23:30:52	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-28 23:31:04	@J	probably won't need arbitrary-click then
2014-04-28 23:31:07	@J	if that makes sense
2014-04-28 23:31:11	@J	quadruple, etc.

2014-04-28 23:31:53	@J	hmm, how does triple-click even work, with respect to the time limit?  Does it give you the same delay between the 2nd and 3rd clicks, or a double-click delay between the 1st and 3rd clicks?
2014-04-28 23:31:54	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-04-28 23:32:17	@Espyo	pretty sure it's 1st -> regular delay -> 2nd -> regular delay -> 3rd
2014-04-28 23:32:18	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-04-28 23:32:19	@Espyo	at least on windows
2014-04-28 23:32:33	@J	I guess that would make sense
2014-04-28 23:32:34	@Espyo	I mean, I remember times where I'm lazily clicking textboxes for X or Y reason
2014-04-28 23:32:42	@Espyo	and it slowly toggles between selecting the word and the line
2014-04-28 23:33:33	@J	what do you think about defaults for things like double-click time and button repeat intervals?
2014-04-28 23:33:56	@J	I mean, does it make sense to provide a default, or to make it required if you want those things?
2014-04-28 23:34:11	@Espyo	you can't get those from the OS' settings, can you?
2014-04-28 23:34:24	@Espyo	there should definitely be a default
2014-04-28 23:34:26	@J	and axis thresholds (the on/off points to treat it like a button)
2014-04-28 23:34:37	@J	hmm
2014-04-28 23:35:30	@J	may be able to get OS settings, but I generally feel that unless you're providing OS-like things (for the double-click/repeat, text editing), games shouldn't use the same defaults
2014-04-28 23:36:08	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-28 23:36:21	@J	even navigating through menu items by holding an analogue stick in one direction generally just doesn't feel the same, and you want a different repeat rate
2014-04-28 23:36:35	@J	it depends on your game style too
2014-04-28 23:36:37	@Espyo	you're doing double-tap-hold, right?
2014-04-28 23:36:45	@J	for what?
2014-04-28 23:37:51	@Espyo	some games use it for running
2014-04-28 23:37:53	@Espyo	hold right to walk
2014-04-28 23:37:56	@J	but, anyway, I always find that I just use 0.6 0.4 for axis thresholds (60% across to turn the 'button' on, under 40% to turn it back off), so maybe those should just be defaults
2014-04-28 23:37:56	@Espyo	double-tap-hold to run
2014-04-28 23:38:03	@J	oh, good point

2014-04-28 23:38:24	@J	that comes under what I said earlier, I guess: 'treat double-press as down'
2014-04-28 23:38:48	@Espyo	oh, that
2014-04-28 23:38:55	@Espyo	I use 1.0 on the engine
2014-04-28 23:39:07	@Espyo	and I'm preeeety sure it's because my controller is weird
2014-04-28 23:39:18	@J	1.0 sounds wrong
2014-04-28 23:39:45	@J	I would generally say go for halfway (.5), then make the 'on' a bit higher than the 'off' to avoid jitter around that point
2014-04-28 23:40:09	@Espyo	yep
2014-04-28 23:40:19	@Espyo	except it works fine with 1.0 for me
2014-04-28 23:40:23	@J	deadzones?  I use 0.15-0.2 as a general guideline lower cutoff, but every controller is different
2014-04-28 23:40:28	@Espyo	hm, speaking of which, could you test one of these days?
2014-04-28 23:40:32	@Espyo	I use 0.0 as deadzone
2014-04-28 23:40:51	@J	I'm considering trying to implement automatic deadzone detection
2014-04-28 23:40:53	@J	that should be fun
2014-04-28 23:41:02	@J	even better if it magically works while you're playing
2014-04-28 23:41:30	@Espyo	I can see that going all sorts of crazily wrong though
2014-04-28 23:41:38	@J	yep
2014-04-28 23:41:45	@J	but wrong in fun ways
2014-04-28 23:41:59	@J	fun for your opponents, anyway
2014-04-28 23:42:05	@Espyo	heh
2014-04-28 23:43:05	@J	but if you look for sudden drops to 'near 0', then look for small deviations across to the other side of 0, and take a 90th percentile of that as a magnitude over time, or something...
2014-04-28 23:43:52	@J	0.0 sounds kind of wrong - if I do that with my controller, you end up with, for example, the character looking in the opposite direction when you release it
2014-04-28 23:44:15	@J	and obviously constant cursor, etc. movement when it's released
2014-04-28 23:44:38	@Espyo	yeah, I figured
2014-04-28 23:44:42	@Espyo	my controller is really weird then
2014-04-28 23:44:47	@Espyo	I think its builtin deadzone is like 50%
2014-04-28 23:44:52	@J	heh
2014-04-28 23:47:30	@Espyo	come to think of it, my other controller had a pretty poor deadzone as well
2014-04-28 23:49:31	@J	I also need a million more things, like an interface to grab input (for rebinding controls), automatic control scheme assignment for multiplayer, input recording/playback...
2014-04-28 23:49:35	@J	I'm so lazy
2014-04-28 23:49:41	@J	speaking of which, I should sleep
2014-04-28 23:49:48	@Espyo	hehe
2014-04-28 23:49:57	@J	goodnight
2014-04-28 23:51:20	@Espyo	night

2014-04-29 20:07:16	@Espyo	 4.1 is up for debate
2014-04-29 20:07:20	Meisterbot	ok
2014-04-29 20:07:28	@Espyo	that's just an overly scary and elaborate way of saying: "Don't create articles with 10 words."
2014-04-29 20:07:40	Meisterbot	oh
2014-04-29 20:07:45	Meisterbot	well then i understand it all

2014-04-29 21:17:30	@J	finally found the time to try Vimperator
2014-04-29 21:17:48	@J	it has ctrl-x/ctrl-a to decrement/increment the last number in the URL
2014-04-29 21:17:52	@J	that's wonderful
2014-04-29 21:18:08	@J	also gu/gU to go up a URL component/to the domain
2014-04-29 21:18:49	@Espyo	neat
2014-04-29 21:18:57	@Espyo	though what IS Vimperator?
2014-04-29 21:19:55	@J	Vim-like navigation for Fierfox
2014-04-29 21:19:58	@J	*Firefox
2014-04-29 21:22:43	@J	it's going to take a while to retrain some things, like ctrl-f -> /
2014-04-29 21:23:30	@Espyo	ah, neat
2014-04-29 21:23:41	@Espyo	I use Firegestures to increase/decrease the number, and go up, though
2014-04-29 21:23:43	@Espyo	also dinner, brb
2014-04-29 21:35:44	@Espyo	back
2014-04-29 21:53:17	Testyo	ok.... *shrug*
2014-04-29 21:54:50	@Espyo	WHY ARE YOU UNSERIOUS HERE
2014-04-29 21:54:53	@Espyo	Testyo: serious #Pikipedia
2014-04-29 21:54:54	Testyo	Very well. I am now in "serious" mode on #Pikipedia.
2014-04-29 21:59:31	Miles_	...
2014-04-29 21:59:40	@Espyo	I swear he makes no sense
2014-04-29 22:00:22	@J	why would you say that about Miles?
2014-04-29 22:02:49	@Espyo	nah, Miles is only ellipsical
2014-04-29 22:02:55	@Espyo	Testyo is the one that's senseless
2014-04-29 22:10:58	@J	okay, I guess the thing I like most is that everything is searchable
2014-04-29 22:11:11	@J	menu items, links on the page, closed tabs
2014-04-29 22:19:22	@Espyo	nice
2014-04-29 22:24:38	@J	you can set a number of temporary 'marks', which store scroll position in a certain tab, and revisit them by label during the session
2014-04-29 22:24:45	@J	should be useful for long pages
2014-04-29 22:25:09	@Espyo	yeah
2014-04-29 22:25:10	@Espyo	that's great
2014-04-29 22:26:28	@J	and obviously there's pretty much programming in there
2014-04-29 22:26:43	@J	but that will have to wait until later...
2014-04-29 22:26:58	@J	running a command in each tab looks simple and useful-ish
2014-04-29 22:27:12	@J	like, easily bookmark all tabs (though there's probably a shortcut for that anyway)
2014-04-29 22:27:32	@Espyo	hm, yeah

2014-04-29 23:37:10	@Espyo	they stop working like they should
2014-04-29 23:38:55	@Espyo	I have a transformation to transform from screen coordinates to world coordinates
2014-04-29 23:38:58	@Espyo	on the animation editor
2014-04-29 23:39:21	@Espyo	I want to draw a horizontal line at world X 0, and the center of the screen
2014-04-29 23:39:28	@Espyo	so I transform from the center of the screen to world coordinates
2014-04-29 23:39:46	@Espyo	aaaand the resulting coordinate is like half of the distance between the center and Y = 0

2014-05-03 19:06:28	@Espyo	visual studio is apparently frozen in time and space
2014-05-03 19:06:37	@PikFan	...ok what happened at Fanon
2014-05-03 19:06:39	@Espyo	so I'm glad there's somebody to chat with
2014-05-03 19:06:41	@Espyo	spambot outbreak
2014-05-03 19:06:42	@PikFan	spam wave?
2014-05-03 19:06:45	@Espyo	one register per hour
2014-05-03 19:06:50	@Espyo	Porple changed the captcha system
2014-05-03 19:06:51	@PikFan	ugh
2014-05-03 19:06:54	@Espyo	now they've stopped
2014-05-03 19:07:02	@Espyo	PB deleted the pages
2014-05-03 19:07:04	@Espyo	everything's back to normal
2014-05-03 19:07:13	@Espyo	apart from that large tumor in the recent changes, but yeah
2014-05-03 19:07:14	@PikFan	good
2014-05-03 19:07:20	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2014-05-03 19:07:26	@Espyo	oh, finally, only took it two minutes to find "chomp_hitboxes"
2014-05-03 19:08:19	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-05-03 19:08:21	@Espyo	hey J
2014-05-03 19:08:27	@Espyo	think we should have actual URLS on the topic?
2014-05-03 19:08:44	@PikFan	also might want to read New Pikminjp's post http://www.pikminfanon.com/Topic:Big_changes
2014-05-03 19:08:59	@PikFan	honestly I'm not sure how to respond to him
2014-05-03 19:09:17	@Espyo	same...
2014-05-03 19:10:21	@PikFan	what I'm getting though is that his excuse to not write good articles is that " I honestly have put days into the project"
2014-05-03 19:10:33	@Espyo	that can all be resolved lter
2014-05-03 19:10:34	@Espyo	*later

2014-05-03 19:12:19	@J	[19:08:27] @Espyo think we should have actual URLS on the topic?
2014-05-03 19:12:22	@J	what?
2014-05-03 19:14:07	@Espyo	we have "pikminwiki.com"
2014-05-03 19:14:14	@Espyo	why not "http://pikminwiki.com"?
2014-05-03 19:14:19	@Espyo	so it's clickable?
2014-05-03 19:14:29	@Espyo	a common enemy... dunno
2014-05-03 19:14:33	@Espyo	but a common Pikmin has to be Cyan
2014-05-03 19:14:40	@J	oh, IRC topic
2014-05-03 19:14:42	@J	could do
2014-05-03 19:14:49	@J	can't you change that?
2014-05-03 19:15:35	@Espyo	I can, I was just asking for opinion
2014-05-03 19:15:46	@J	yeah, no reason not to
2014-05-03 19:15:48	@Espyo	as far as I know, it's the way it is so that spambots don't click it
2014-05-03 19:15:51	@Espyo	by channel topic sniffing
2014-05-03 19:16:00	@J	not really
2014-05-03 19:16:18	@J	even if they did, the most likely way for them to find it is by starting at the site

2014-05-04 21:59:55	@Espyo	heh, yeah, just... never mind that
2014-05-04 22:00:14	@Espyo	I probably had to check some other piece of info that comes with the list of recent changes
2014-05-04 22:00:20	@Espyo	and make him specify whether it's an account creation or deletion
2014-05-04 22:00:22	@Espyo	but I don't
2014-05-04 22:00:30	@Espyo	and I can't be bothered to, because we NEVER have to delete accounts

2014-05-04 22:25:41	@PikFan	what should I write in it?
2014-05-04 22:26:17	@Espyo	I thought you had it, and the name was missing
2014-05-04 22:26:21	@Espyo	hm
2014-05-04 22:26:52	@PikFan	I was thinking a c+p of what you wrote, and some other things
2014-05-04 22:27:00	@Espyo	"As of <today>, Pikmin Fanon has established a new article policy. This is an attempt to improve the overall quality of the wiki. The following points should be taken into consideration regarding content articles:"
2014-05-04 22:27:03	@Espyo	and then c+p
2014-05-04 22:27:26	@PikFan	meh
2014-05-04 22:27:50	@PikFan	don't like the first sentence

2014-05-04 22:29:07	@PikFan	"The Organization Policy regards how articles should be written."
2014-05-04 22:30:28	@PikFan	actually, no

2014-05-04 22:31:08	@PikFan	mmm
2014-05-04 22:31:55	@Espyo	why not Article Policy?
2014-05-04 22:32:03	@Espyo	also I like the 2nd better
2014-05-04 22:32:17	@PikFan	ooh, Article Policy
2014-05-04 22:32:20	@PikFan	sounds great
2014-05-04 22:34:06	@PikFan	(verifying; by 2nd, you meant the 2nd of my sentences?)
2014-05-04 22:37:09	@PikFan	also do you want __NOTOC__?
2014-05-04 22:38:06	@PikFan	another thing
2014-05-04 22:38:16	@PikFan	I feel like there's something... missing
2014-05-04 22:38:44	@PikFan	because this policy only covers part of it
2014-05-04 22:38:57	@Espyo	(2nd of your sentences)
2014-05-04 22:39:03	@Espyo	well, add the rest, of course
2014-05-04 22:39:09	@Espyo	my things were just changes
2014-05-04 22:39:20	@Espyo	and... maybe add the article examples into subpages?
2014-05-04 22:39:27	@Espyo	or maybe shorten them up, I just wrote them as concrete examples
2014-05-04 22:41:59	@PikFan	also, I never really got the example infobox thingy
2014-05-04 22:42:21	@PikFan	doesn't look like an infobox to me
2014-05-04 22:44:09	@Espyo	what infobox?
2014-05-04 22:44:13	@Espyo	I never wrote any infobox

2014-05-07 20:25:38	@J	so, a while back I mentioned SpaceFM, which is the file manager I switched to, and all the crazy stuff you can do
2014-05-07 20:25:46	@J	I just discovered 'action context'
2014-05-07 20:26:04	@J	for any menu item, you can specify the contexts for which it exists/is enabled
2014-05-07 20:26:14	@J	and there are so many options
2014-05-07 20:26:57	@J	http://i.imgur.com/DLhDrID.jpg
2014-05-07 20:27:34	@J	not sure if I mentioned before, you can edit any menu item, add your own, reorder them, export/import, etc.
2014-05-07 20:27:50	@J	set keyboard shortcuts, icons, hotkeys...
2014-05-07 20:27:58	@Espyo	wow that's great
2014-05-07 20:28:08	@Espyo	but I'm not quite sure about the action context
2014-05-07 20:28:16	@Espyo	you mean a context menu for folders and files?
2014-05-07 20:28:19	@Espyo	or for menu items?
2014-05-07 20:28:38	@J	for menu items, whether they're visible in the context menu
2014-05-07 20:28:43	@J	or visible but disabled
2014-05-07 20:28:48	@Espyo	ah, right
2014-05-07 20:29:04	@Espyo	pretty darn amazing
2014-05-07 20:31:42	@J	oh, and I bought/played Antichamber this weekend
2014-05-07 20:32:24	@Espyo	Antichamber...
2014-05-07 20:32:28	@Espyo	I know I know what it is...
2014-05-07 20:32:33	@Espyo	isn't that the one with the mindfuck puzzles?
2014-05-07 20:32:39	@Espyo	it's on my Steam wishlist, IIRC
2014-05-07 20:32:49	@J	yeah, that's generally how it's described
2014-05-07 20:33:00	@Espyo	awesome
2014-05-07 20:33:03	@Espyo	any good?
2014-05-07 20:33:31	@J	I've played games with better puzzles, but as a whole, it's very good
2014-05-07 20:33:47	@J	certainly something everyone should give a go, though there are plenty of people who won't enjoy it
2014-05-07 20:34:04	@Espyo	hm, I'd imagine so
2014-05-07 20:34:06	@J	it has more lateral-thinking puzzles than I would like (that, is, more than none)
2014-05-07 20:34:56	@J	and the whole spatial stuff isn't really as big as people make it sound like it is, or at least it seems that way to me
2014-05-07 20:35:24	@J	there's a much more solid/logical puzzle mechanic to do with manipulating small cubes, and that's the part of the game I liked, gameplay-wise
2014-05-07 20:36:30	@J	though it's actually quite nice that it has, in a sense, two types of gameplay
2014-05-07 20:36:37	@J	keeps it refreshing, or something
2014-05-07 20:38:34	@Espyo	can't really remember when was the last time I played a lateral-thinking puzzle
2014-05-07 20:38:44	@Espyo	but yeah, it seems fairly decent
2014-05-07 20:38:52	@Espyo	now I just need money and time
2014-05-07 20:38:56	@Espyo	did you complete it already?
2014-05-07 20:39:04	@J	there are a few of the logical puzzles I didn't like because you could solve them by just spending a lot of time doing something simple, which isn't the intended solution
2014-05-07 20:39:11	@J	I finished it, but not 100%
2014-05-07 20:39:34	@J	you can finish it quite a way before 100%, but I think I did most of it before finishing
2014-05-07 20:39:40	@Espyo	oh
2014-05-07 20:41:28	@J	it's also fairly non-linear, and it doesn't tell you which rooms you can get past yet and which you can't, which some people like and some people don't
2014-05-07 20:41:46	@Espyo	I really like non-linearty in games
2014-05-07 20:41:52	@J	when I say lateral-thinking, I just mean anything to which logic doesn't really apply
2014-05-07 20:41:57	@Espyo	except when it just gets painfully confusing
2014-05-07 20:42:03	@Espyo	oh
2014-05-07 20:42:11	@Espyo	I thought you meant like having to keep track of two things at once
2014-05-07 20:42:21	@J	like in most adventure games, you end up just clicking everything and trying to combine everything
2014-05-07 20:42:31	@J	the solution probably makes sense, but it's mostly trial-and-error
2014-05-07 20:42:43	@Espyo	right
2014-05-07 20:42:50	@J	okay, I have no idea what you're thinking
2014-05-07 20:43:00	@J	not sure if there's a word for that?
2014-05-07 20:43:05	@J	multi-tasking, if any
2014-05-07 20:43:20	@Espyo	multi-tasking, definitely
2014-05-07 20:43:24	@J	hmm
2014-05-07 20:43:28	@Espyo	hey, you know, lateral
2014-05-07 20:43:30	@Espyo	side-by-side
2014-05-07 20:43:34	@J	yeah
2014-05-07 20:43:35	@Espyo	mult
2014-05-07 20:43:35	@Espyo	*multi
2014-05-07 20:43:53	@J	I think the game it most reminds me of is Corrypt, which is free
2014-05-07 20:44:00	@J	also Fez
2014-05-07 20:44:23	@J	same sort of detached atmosphere, mix of logical and lateral puzzles, non-linear, encouraging exploration
2014-05-07 20:44:43	@J	you should probably play Corrypt, though it's a fair amount harder than Antichamber
2014-05-07 20:45:19	@Espyo	oh, Corrypt
2014-05-07 20:45:24	@Espyo	pretty sure I played this before
2014-05-07 20:45:29	@Espyo	or if not, I watched a video
2014-05-07 20:45:54	@Espyo	you might've linked me to it after some Ludum Dare
2014-05-07 20:46:31	@J	I don't think it's a LD game
2014-05-07 20:48:36	@J	wait, looking at his games, I think I met this guy
2014-05-07 20:48:56	@Espyo	that'd be pretty nice
2014-05-07 20:53:41	@J	...also one of his games is called O, which I seem to have played before, and one of my games, released in the same month, is called o
2014-05-07 20:54:39	@Espyo	hah
2014-05-07 20:54:49	@Espyo	yours was about a tiny resolution, wasn't it?
2014-05-07 20:55:03	@J	yeahw
2014-05-07 20:55:05	@J	...
2014-05-07 20:55:07	@J	*yeah
2014-05-07 20:55:10	@J	well, yes and no
2014-05-07 20:55:11	@J	but yes
2014-05-07 20:55:13	@J	I guess
2014-05-07 20:56:29	@Espyo	yeah, just kind of

2014-05-09 00:55:21	@PikFan	ok something happened to my wrinklers
2014-05-09 00:55:45	@PikFan	I've been letting these wrinklers suck for a while now, should release 85 quint each
2014-05-09 00:56:00	@PikFan	...instead they will release 5 quad
2014-05-09 00:56:56	@PikFan	and I didn't even touch them or anything
2014-05-09 00:57:15	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaah
2014-05-09 00:57:42	@PikFan	I never remember popping them
2014-05-09 00:57:49	@PikFan	so why did they reset
2014-05-09 00:58:08	@PikFan	well 850 quintillion cookies just vanished
2014-05-09 00:58:21	@PikFan	now I'm frustrated
2014-05-09 01:18:43	@Espyo	whaaaa
2014-05-09 01:18:50	@Espyo	well, simple
2014-05-09 01:18:58	@Espyo	Ctrl + Shift + K
2014-05-09 01:19:09	@Espyo	Game.Earn(8500000000(...)000);
2014-05-09 01:19:16	@Espyo	can't be bothered to count the 0s
2014-05-09 01:19:19	@PikFan	...are you implying I should cheat them back in
2014-05-09 01:19:28	@Espyo	it's not cheating if you deserve it
2014-05-09 01:19:35	@Espyo	just make 100% sure you didn't pop them on accident
2014-05-09 01:19:46	@PikFan	yeah, I didn't pop them
2014-05-09 01:19:49	@Espyo	and make 100% sure they really are releasing 5 quad
2014-05-09 01:19:58	@Espyo	and not 4 sex or something
2014-05-09 01:20:09	@Espyo	but yeah, cheating is gaining an unfair advantage
2014-05-09 01:20:10	@Espyo	that's the definition
2014-05-09 01:20:23	@PikFan	well, it was 5 quad when I was going to check them
2014-05-09 01:20:29	@Espyo	it's not an unfair advantage, you did your rightful job by farming them, legitimately
2014-05-09 01:20:31	@PikFan	now I've just left them
2014-05-09 01:20:45	@Espyo	you can pop them after the game saves and close the tab before the game saves again
2014-05-09 01:20:49	@Espyo	just to check
2014-05-09 01:20:50	@PikFan	and they give 5.58 quint now
2014-05-09 01:20:56	@Espyo	or create a backup save
2014-05-09 01:21:01	@Espyo	you sure it's not just one troublemaker?
2014-05-09 01:21:12	@PikFan	this is how I check:
2014-05-09 01:21:21	@PikFan	save, refresh, pop a wrinkler, refresh
2014-05-09 01:21:34	@Espyo	yeah, that works
2014-05-09 01:21:44	@PikFan	I've been doing that, and cookies haven't been disappearing
2014-05-09 01:21:54	@PikFan	and then I checked them again, but they vanished
2014-05-09 01:22:39	@PikFan	welp
2014-05-09 01:22:50	@PikFan	guess I'll add those cookies then
2014-05-09 01:22:54	@Espyo	mhm
2014-05-09 01:23:05	@Espyo	back before I reset, my computer crashed a couple of times
2014-05-09 01:23:08	@Espyo	and I lost my wrinklers
2014-05-09 01:23:14	@Espyo	so I just cheated like 5 quint
2014-05-09 01:23:18	@Espyo	which is pretty much what I lost
2014-05-09 01:23:46	@PikFan	ok, put in 800 quint, just to be safe
2014-05-09 01:24:36	@Espyo	before I go to bed
2014-05-09 01:24:51	@Espyo	'cause I want to see if I can have more energy tomorrow
2014-05-09 01:24:56	@Espyo	(energy = more motivation to work on the engine)
2014-05-09 01:24:59	@Espyo	I have two things to say
2014-05-09 01:25:03	@Espyo	first, I'm writing [[HUD]]
2014-05-09 01:25:03	Testyo	"HUD" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=HUD
2014-05-09 01:25:13	@Espyo	I'll need your help to fill in some Pikmin 3 details after
2014-05-09 01:25:22	@PikFan	mhm
2014-05-09 01:25:33	@Espyo	second
2014-05-09 01:25:42	@Espyo	today I finished something on the engine
2014-05-09 01:25:48	@Espyo	the areas are made of polygons
2014-05-09 01:25:56	@Espyo	and to draw them, I have to separate them in triangles
2014-05-09 01:26:03	@Espyo	and to do that, I have to do complex math
2014-05-09 01:26:10	@Espyo	I took info from a lot of sites, mashed everything together
2014-05-09 01:26:14	@PikFan	what do you mean, 'areas are made of polygons'?
2014-05-09 01:26:26	@Espyo	a big, complicated process, prone with human error
2014-05-09 01:26:45	@Espyo	just filled with loads of tiny details that I could only imagine would cause infinite headaches and make me really unmotivated over everything crashing
2014-05-09 01:26:52	@Espyo	I finally finished assembling everything together
2014-05-09 01:26:53	@PikFan	hm
2014-05-09 01:26:54	@Espyo	I go to test it
2014-05-09 01:26:55	@Espyo	and...
2014-05-09 01:27:01	@Espyo	it works perfectly the first time
2014-05-09 01:27:07	@Espyo	that is down-right impossible
2014-05-09 01:27:17	@Espyo	I've written single lines of stupidly simple code that caused problems
2014-05-09 01:27:29	@Espyo	and suddenly I write this complex behemoth and it works fine at first try?
2014-05-09 01:27:31	@Espyo	miracle
2014-05-09 01:27:40	@PikFan	heh
2014-05-09 01:27:53	@PikFan	pure luck
2014-05-09 01:28:00	@Espyo	had to be
2014-05-09 01:28:03	@PikFan	well, let's try not to jinx it
2014-05-09 01:28:13	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-09 01:28:21	@Espyo	so yeah, motivation was meh these past few days
2014-05-09 01:28:24	@Espyo	now it's back up
2014-05-09 01:28:27	@Espyo	it's like a rollercoaster
2014-05-09 01:28:28	@PikFan	mm
2014-05-09 01:28:32	@Espyo	the biggest dip happened when I had performance issues
2014-05-09 01:28:40	@Espyo	and I'm still /very/ scared about them
2014-05-09 01:28:51	@PikFan	I see
2014-05-09 01:28:55	@Espyo	but anyway, areas being polygons is more areas being MADE OF polygons
2014-05-09 01:29:11	@Espyo	like the tree trunk in TIS is just one 20-sided polygon
2014-05-09 01:29:13	@PikFan	yeah
2014-05-09 01:30:39	@Espyo	night
2014-05-09 01:30:49	@Espyo	(also when I said 20, I meant 20-ish
2014-05-09 01:30:51	@Espyo	*)
2014-05-09 01:30:57	@Espyo	(probably more like 30 or so)

2014-05-10 13:19:13	@Espyo	oh, so Metroid Prime TASes can now be made?
2014-05-10 13:37:35	Miles	When I last tried it (a week or two ago) they were still too fast, even with the improvements
2014-05-10 13:37:43	Miles	Loads were
2014-05-10 13:39:08	@Espyo	http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=375376#375376 this was posted two days ago
2014-05-10 13:39:17	@Espyo	damn the loading time shenanigans
2014-05-10 13:40:03	Miles	I guess they're just not good at testing
2014-05-10 13:40:45	Miles	Probably went somewhere along the line of "hey, this door didn't open instantly and I actually had to wait, this feels right"
2014-05-10 13:41:25	@Espyo	people are just really hyped for a TAS
2014-05-10 13:41:31	Miles	Relatedly trying to hack Prime sucks
2014-05-10 13:41:53	@Espyo	you mean file editing, or Cheat Engine?
2014-05-10 13:41:58	Miles	File editing
2014-05-10 13:42:26	@Espyo	it doesn't use the most common file types, does it
2014-05-10 13:42:41	@Espyo	you probably already did, but, did you try the JP version?
2014-05-10 13:43:00	Miles	What?
2014-05-10 13:43:10	@Espyo	the Japanese version
2014-05-10 13:43:26	Miles	I know, why would I try it
2014-05-10 13:43:39	@Espyo	just maybe, the files are less compressed?
2014-05-10 13:43:45	@Espyo	you know, first version and all
2014-05-10 13:43:51	@Espyo	hey, you never know
2014-05-10 13:43:56	Miles	...Prime was made by Retro
2014-05-10 13:43:59	Miles	In Texas
2014-05-10 13:44:12	@Espyo	err, scratch the "first version" part then
2014-05-10 13:48:33	Miles	Anyway
2014-05-10 13:48:42	Miles	Made lists of every object in every room
2014-05-10 13:48:51	Miles	So I'm slowly going through this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgjVlmkKULAtKanQMIfkqA27Na9VjuLS_azBLx-uNxY/edit#gid=0
2014-05-10 13:50:20	@Espyo	wow that's detailed
2014-05-10 13:50:22	@Espyo	amazing
2014-05-10 13:50:31	@Espyo	any sweet discoveries?
2014-05-10 13:51:38	Miles	I can probably change a missile refill so it gives me Varia!
2014-05-10 13:51:41	Miles	>_>
2014-05-10 13:51:56	Miles	As upgrades and refills are really the same thing
2014-05-10 13:52:41	Miles	Also Artifact Temple has an unused area teleporter that would send you to itself
2014-05-10 13:54:08	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-05-10 16:14:09	@Espyo	J
2014-05-10 16:14:13	@Espyo	if you're there, I need Python help

2014-05-10 21:59:56	@PikFan	the last box shows how many are on the field
2014-05-10 22:00:40	@PikFan	then the pointer has a number and icon too
2014-05-10 22:00:42	@Espyo	yeah, but what about the three "standby Pikmin" icons
2014-05-10 22:00:48	@Espyo	pointer?
2014-05-10 22:00:50	@PikFan	...oh, right
2014-05-10 22:00:59	@Espyo	oh yeah, the cursor
2014-05-10 22:01:05	@Espyo	I should mention the cursor on [[HUD]]
2014-05-10 22:01:05	Testyo	"HUD" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=HUD
2014-05-10 22:01:43	@PikFan	we'll include that when I add P3 stuff
2014-05-10 22:01:52	@Espyo	fair enough
2014-05-10 22:02:02	@PikFan	right, so the standby Pikmin icons
2014-05-10 22:02:41	@PikFan	when you cycle through the types in the group, you'll go to the first standby Pikmin
2014-05-10 22:03:04	@PikFan	then the next one, etc, until you come back to what you had originally
2014-05-10 22:04:04	@Espyo	oh, I see
2014-05-10 22:04:15	@Espyo	and the second bubble is the next type you'll pick
2014-05-10 22:04:23	@PikFan	yeah
2014-05-10 22:04:46	@PikFan	so sometimes, while you're playing, leaders will talk
2014-05-10 22:05:16	@Espyo	mhm, that should also be pointed out
2014-05-10 22:05:18	@Espyo	at least briefly
2014-05-10 22:05:26	@Espyo	we can have stuff like [[Pikmin 3 monologs]] later
2014-05-10 22:05:26	Testyo	"Pikmin_3_monologs" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_3_monologs
2014-05-10 22:05:35	@Espyo	but at least we should point out that the monologs appear on-screen
2014-05-10 22:05:40	@PikFan	so if they talk, they either pause the game and talk in a primary box at the bottom, or keep the game unpaused and talk in a secondary box near the top
2014-05-10 22:05:54	@Espyo	yeah, I saw a couple of fluent monologs
2014-05-10 22:05:58	@Espyo	like "Pikmin are dying!"
2014-05-10 22:06:05	@PikFan	right
2014-05-10 22:19:47	@PikFan	well, Xtarhaven's got the right idea http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_4:_Curse_of_Astromountain
2014-05-10 22:20:18	@Espyo	heh
2014-05-10 22:20:28	@Espyo	hm, should we do the template that marks the old style?
2014-05-10 22:20:33	@Espyo	we really have to say yes or no
2014-05-10 22:20:47	@Espyo	just going "meh, we'll decide later" over and over will lead to us never getting anything done

2014-05-11 18:34:26	@J	I tried uzbl today
2014-05-11 18:34:40	@J	it's a web browser that does things
2014-05-11 18:34:42	@Espyo	sounds weird
2014-05-11 18:34:59	@J	it does when I say it like that
2014-05-11 18:35:20	@Espyo	dang kids, trying uzbls nowadays
2014-05-11 18:35:28	@Espyo	but yeah, what's so special?
2014-05-11 18:35:30	@J	so, everything is customisable, and is all in a config file
2014-05-11 18:35:46	@J	all the keybindings
2014-05-11 18:35:49	@J	event handlers
2014-05-11 18:35:53	@J	a lot of the functionality
2014-05-11 18:36:13	@J	it works like Vim (I told you about Vimperator the other day, which is similar)
2014-05-11 18:36:28	@J	and everything is really simple
2014-05-11 18:36:49	@J	so, for example, the history is just a file with date/url/title on each line
2014-05-11 18:36:53	@Espyo	hm, nice
2014-05-11 18:36:57	@Espyo	but how does it do performance-wise?
2014-05-11 18:37:01	@Espyo	doesn't sound very friendly
2014-05-11 18:37:35	@J	and in the config file, it defines a command that browses the history by piping the URLs into dmenu, a nice keyboard-driven filtering thing
2014-05-11 18:37:47	@J	and you can change that to be whatever you want
2014-05-11 18:38:10	@J	you could easily write a script to combine your bookmarks and history before searching
2014-05-11 18:38:19	@Espyo	oh, ice
2014-05-11 18:38:20	@Espyo	*n
2014-05-11 18:38:25	@J	it uses WebKit underneath, so browsing is the same as Chrome, etc.
2014-05-11 18:38:33	@J	startup is several times faster, though
2014-05-11 18:38:44	@Espyo	hm
2014-05-11 18:39:31	@J	to implement tabs, it runs a wrapper program that runs a browser instance in each tab
2014-05-11 18:39:46	@J	and you can use/write a different wrapper if you want, or not have tabs at all
2014-05-11 18:41:35	@Espyo	speaking of web browsers
2014-05-11 18:41:43	@Espyo	did Firefox update to become Chrome on Linux as well?
2014-05-11 18:43:54	@J	hmm, not sure
2014-05-11 18:44:11	@Espyo	the tabs now look like tabs on a real folder
2014-05-11 18:44:14	@Espyo	just like Chrome's
2014-05-11 18:44:27	@Espyo	and there's now a button that has all the convenient menus, on the top-right
2014-05-11 18:44:28	@J	I use Littlefox, Tree Style Tab, Tab Mix Plus, and some other things that make interface changes harder to notice
2014-05-11 18:44:31	@Espyo	just like Chrome
2014-05-11 18:44:40	@Espyo	and that button's icon is three horizontal lines
2014-05-11 18:44:42	@Espyo	...just like Chrome
2014-05-11 18:44:47	@J	I did notice that the navigation bar become impossible to disable, so I installed an addon for that
2014-05-11 18:45:03	@Espyo	why would you disable it?
2014-05-11 18:45:06	@J	oh, yeah, there was that button on the navigation bar which I removed
2014-05-11 18:45:16	@J	Vimperator shows the URL in its command bar
2014-05-11 18:45:22	@Espyo	hm
2014-05-11 18:45:48	@J	also, you can (or used to be able to) move all the bits to other toolbars
2014-05-11 18:46:13	@J	like, put the URL bit on the bookmarks toolbar and hide the navigation toolbar
2014-05-11 18:46:47	@Espyo	you might still be able to
2014-05-11 18:47:04	@Espyo	can't check right now, I just disabled my bookmarks bar altogether
2014-05-11 18:47:19	@Espyo	and whenever I change the layout of the bars, stuff stops working
2014-05-11 18:47:22	@Espyo	uh, bookmarks stop working
2014-05-11 18:47:30	@Espyo	that's been happening for ages now, and I stopped caring
2014-05-11 18:47:38	@Espyo	not like I change the layout every day
2014-05-11 18:53:52	@J	I think I heard the URL field and that new button and reload button are all stuck together now
2014-05-11 18:54:18	@Espyo	bleh
2014-05-11 18:55:09	@J	I do have curved tabs if I use a new profile, but they're not at the top of the window - File, Edit, etc. are all visible and above them
2014-05-11 18:57:12	@Espyo	that's a bit messed up
2014-05-11 18:58:00	@Espyo	anyway, I'm using HexChat now
2014-05-11 18:58:17	@Espyo	it's pretty neat
2014-05-11 18:58:33	@Espyo	dunno if you caught it yesterday, but I asked for Python help
2014-05-11 18:58:43	@Espyo	I was writing a script that automatically colored my messages
2014-05-11 18:58:51	@Espyo	I did eventually succeed
2014-05-11 18:58:53	@Espyo	err, kinda
2014-05-11 18:58:59	@Espyo	apparently one of the functions isn't doing what it should
2014-05-11 18:59:02	@Espyo	but it's not my fault
2014-05-11 18:59:16	@Espyo	it's just not saving my preferences regarding which channels use which color
2014-05-11 18:59:23	@Espyo	but at least it can fetch them right, so it could be worse
2014-05-11 18:59:43	@J	I have heard about HexChat
2014-05-11 19:00:05	@J	never used it, but I think I'd still prefer Q...something on Windows
2014-05-11 19:00:12	@J	okay, why can't I remember what it's called?
2014-05-11 19:00:28	@Espyo	can't remember any starting with Q
2014-05-11 19:00:50	@J	Quassel
2014-05-11 19:01:13	@Espyo	woah, I really never heard of that
2014-05-11 19:01:27	@J	I'm sure there are loads you've never heard of
2014-05-11 19:02:33	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-05-11 19:02:59	@J	anyway, Quassel is nice because you can move all the bits of the GUI around
2014-05-11 19:03:12	@J	haven't used it for a few years, though
2014-05-11 19:03:28	@Espyo	well, that is nice, but not that important over other features IMO
2014-05-11 19:04:26	@J	I guess the fact I don't really remember anything else means it did everything I wanted
2014-05-11 19:04:48	@Espyo	heh
2014-05-11 19:06:36	@Espyo	all right, listen
2014-05-11 19:06:41	@Espyo	nex time you want to do a big game
2014-05-11 19:06:46	@Espyo	do NOT make your stages out of polygons
2014-05-11 19:06:57	@Espyo	use the good ol' square tile method
2014-05-11 19:07:15	@J	stages as in platforms, or levels?
2014-05-11 19:07:20	@Espyo	levels
2014-05-11 19:07:27	@Espyo	you know, the geometry of a level
2014-05-11 19:07:55	@J	having fun?
2014-05-11 19:08:04	@Espyo	you have to worry about triangulating the polygons, which means keeping track of the sides of the lines of the polygons, the vertices, have so much auxilary information to make sure performance is tolerable...
2014-05-11 19:08:20	@Espyo	right now I'm just copying the source code for Doom Builder and hoping for the best
2014-05-11 19:08:26	@Espyo	I hope it's worth it in the end though, at least
2014-05-11 19:10:32	@J	what are you even making?
2014-05-11 19:10:47	@J	or is it the Pikmin engine?
2014-05-11 19:11:39	@Espyo	the engine
2014-05-11 19:11:49	@J	collisions with the level boundaries?
2014-05-11 19:11:57	@Espyo	more like level boundaries, period
2014-05-11 19:12:15	@Espyo	whether it's drawing, checking for collisions, or a level editor
2014-05-11 19:12:20	@Espyo	I'm gonna need all these things
2014-05-11 19:13:23	@J	okay, that didn't fill me up at all
2014-05-11 19:13:31	@J	I'm going to have to cook something else
2014-05-11 19:13:43	@Espyo	you just eat and eat and eat
2014-05-11 19:13:44	@Espyo	it's incredible
2014-05-11 19:13:55	@J	hey, I only eat at dinner time
2014-05-11 19:14:00	@J	and the other meals
2014-05-11 19:14:03	@J	of which there are only 2 more
2014-05-11 19:14:04	@Espyo	and snacls
2014-05-11 19:14:06	@Espyo	*snacks
2014-05-11 19:14:17	@J	hmm
2014-05-11 19:14:28	@J	I don't really have snacks
2014-05-11 19:14:36	@J	...not until after dinner, anyway
2014-05-11 19:15:17	@Espyo	you know, the occasional biscuit while a page is loading
2014-05-11 19:16:42	@J	hey, just because I live in England doesn't mean snacks means biscuits
2014-05-11 19:16:58	@Espyo	snacks aren't biscuits, but biscuits are snacks
2014-05-11 19:17:12	@Espyo	I mean...
2014-05-11 19:17:20	@Espyo	uh, depends on the EXACT definition of snack
2014-05-11 19:17:24	@Espyo	but hey, nobody knows what it is
2014-05-11 19:17:42	@Espyo	could mean anything from "food outside of a meal" to "specific pastries"
2014-05-11 19:18:32	@Espyo	all right, if I don't do something else for a few minutes, I'll have a mental breakdown
2014-05-11 19:18:49	@Espyo	vertices, lines, sides, angles, distances...
2014-05-11 19:18:51	@Espyo	ugh, my head hurts

2014-05-12 21:42:51	@Espyo	never mind those
2014-05-12 21:42:55	@Espyo	that spammer came back
2014-05-12 22:56:47	@J	did you handle it?
2014-05-12 22:57:02	@Espyo	yeah, but I can't delete pages
2014-05-12 22:57:24	@J	did you add {{delete}}?

2014-05-12 23:01:33	@J	in order?
2014-05-12 23:01:41	@Espyo	you know, he created a load of pages at once
2014-05-12 23:01:48	@Espyo	so on the recent changes, they're all together
2014-05-12 23:01:55	@J	together != in order
2014-05-12 23:02:10	@J	but yeah, I just went to contributions, ticked that box to hide reverted stuff
2014-05-12 23:02:25	@Espyo	probably this http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:GIVE_ME_YOUR_PASSWORD and the talk page too

2014-05-12 23:02:46	@Espyo	I hid my edits on the RC
2014-05-12 23:02:49	@J	I guess I could, but I don't see it
2014-05-12 23:02:50	@Espyo	so it kind of confused me
2014-05-12 23:03:47	@J	also, I discovered yesterday that contributions pages have rollback links right there
2014-05-12 23:04:13	@J	so I should be able to open every 'rollback' link on the page in tabs, once I have uzbl set up better

2014-05-14 23:24:23	Omegaknight	Cool, how is that coming along?
2014-05-14 23:27:17	@Espyo	I'm kinda stressed out with working out the areas
2014-05-14 23:27:22	@Espyo	so... much... geometry...
2014-05-14 23:27:41	@Espyo	so to chill out a bit, I decided to draw the sprites for the Red Bulborb
2014-05-14 23:29:02	Omegaknight	How is that coming along?
2014-05-14 23:29:33	@Espyo	surprisingly well
2014-05-14 23:30:07	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/use5717.png I'm just not happy with its color
2014-05-14 23:31:51	Omegaknight	It looks pretty rad.
2014-05-14 23:32:14	@Espyo	thanks
2014-05-14 23:32:23	Omegaknight	You are welcome.
2014-05-14 23:34:02	Omegaknight	That's alot better than I could draw.
2014-05-14 23:35:27	@Espyo	it helps if you're using the right tools for the job
2014-05-14 23:35:38	@Espyo	with this, I don't draw as much as I just create shapes and mold them
2014-05-14 23:35:47	@Espyo	plus, I had a reference picture on the background that I took with an emulator
2014-05-14 23:36:11	@Espyo	if I were to draw the Bulborb by eye... uh, I'd probably end up making a weird square doohicky
2014-05-14 23:36:32	Omegaknight	Mine would be a blob of red, white, and yellow.

2014-05-14 23:50:07	@Espyo	you can edit that topic and tell what page you want deleted

2014-05-17 15:52:14	@Espyo	is it any better than on the Wii?

2014-05-17 15:52:28	@Espyo	like, do you have to point at the key and press A, or is there a keyboard on the touch screen?
2014-05-17 15:52:34	Rosey	due to the touch screen
2014-05-17 15:52:39	@Espyo	oh, sweet
2014-05-17 15:52:42	Rosey	im on the gamepad
2014-05-17 15:52:51	@Espyo	I'm thinking of getting a Wii U soon, but the money...
2014-05-17 15:53:07	Rosey	its had a great pice drop
2014-05-17 15:53:18	@Espyo	yeah, but even still...
2014-05-17 15:53:26	@Espyo	I might just ship it from another country
2014-05-17 15:53:33	@Espyo	because here it's more expensive than most other places
2014-05-17 15:53:40	Rosey	eh,whatever works for you

2014-05-17 15:54:52	Rosey	if I go off,its because my knee hit the gamepad back button

2014-05-17 17:20:18	@Espyo	regular Brawl
2014-05-17 17:20:20	@Espyo	with items
2014-05-17 17:20:26	Rosey	ok,thanks so much
2014-05-17 17:20:27	@Espyo	 3 minute time limit
2014-05-17 17:20:29	@Espyo	mhm
2014-05-17 17:20:38	Rosey	rules I use
2014-05-17 17:20:43	@Espyo	it'll be fun, it always is
2014-05-17 17:20:59	Rosey	btw,some stages have sudden death saftey spots
2014-05-17 17:21:10	@Espyo	yeah, but they're a bit rare
2014-05-17 17:21:14	Rosey	like wileland
2014-05-17 17:21:14	@Espyo	a thing I like to do is pick Shadow Moses
2014-05-17 17:21:18	@Espyo	and on sudden death
2014-05-17 17:21:20	@Espyo	just hold down
2014-05-17 17:21:25	@Espyo	you'll almost never get KOd
2014-05-17 17:21:35	@Espyo	because if you're holding down, it'll influence the direction you get knocked in by the bombs
2014-05-17 17:21:39	@Espyo	and you won't go up as much
2014-05-17 17:21:43	@Espyo	so you'll just bounce on the walls
2014-05-17 17:21:50	Rosey	also,if im say fox on layta cruise,am I allowed to do the secret taunt?
2014-05-17 17:21:54	@Espyo	sure
2014-05-17 17:22:07	Rosey	without being assultedd?
2014-05-17 17:22:10	@Espyo	normally if we have a character that can do a smash taunt, we all stop fighting and wait for that person to do it
2014-05-17 17:22:13	@Espyo	we're civil, don't worry
2014-05-17 17:22:19	@Espyo	we don't even edgehog, edgehogging is just unfair
2014-05-17 17:22:21	Rosey	thank you :D
2014-05-17 17:22:29	Rosey	ok
2014-05-17 17:23:01	@Espyo	speaking of Brawl

2014-05-17 17:23:32	@Espyo	I only have four characters left
2014-05-17 17:23:42	Rosey	its not really worth it
2014-05-17 17:23:45	@Espyo	I don't feel like working on the engine right now, so I'll do it
2014-05-17 17:23:48	@Espyo	I know, there's no reward
2014-05-17 17:23:52	@Espyo	but I'm in it for the challenge
2014-05-17 17:23:57	@Espyo	I've already come this far

2014-05-18 11:47:30	@PikFan	oh
2014-05-18 11:47:50	@PikFan	I was going to tell you this yesterday but I forgot
2014-05-18 11:48:11	@PikFan	so the caves in Pikmin 2 have a maximum number of enemies
2014-05-18 11:48:38	@PikFan	by that I mean they have a cap to the number of corpses
2014-05-18 11:49:01	@PikFan	if an enemy dies, and there are already the max. amount of corpses, that enemy will vanish
2014-05-18 11:49:52	@PikFan	it happened to me on sublevel 8 in the Cavern of Chaos
2014-05-18 11:51:19	@PikFan	got two other things, both of which are CC related:
2014-05-18 11:51:27	@PikFan	1. Easter beta, yay!!!
2014-05-18 11:51:37	@PikFan	2. Prisms cost 1 sextillion cookies
2014-05-18 11:52:07	@PikFan	so in Easter, there are easter eggs
2014-05-18 11:52:17	@PikFan	and I don't know how to find them
2014-05-18 11:52:19	@PikFan	but
2014-05-18 11:52:43	@PikFan	I cheated (it's the beta, so it's fine) and looked at the eggs' abilities
2014-05-18 11:53:04	@PikFan	one egg makes wrinklers give 5% more cookies, another makes GCs appear 5% more often
2014-05-18 11:53:18	@PikFan	another makes clicking 10% more powerful
2014-05-18 11:53:31	@Espyo	hi
2014-05-18 11:53:51	@Espyo	oh wow
2014-05-18 11:53:54	@PikFan	and there's even an egg that increases your cps the longer your session is
2014-05-18 11:53:59	@Espyo	and oh wow, and oh wow
2014-05-18 11:54:20	@Espyo	and finally, oh wow
2014-05-18 11:54:26	@Espyo	so yeah, pretty much "oh wow" to all you said
2014-05-18 11:54:27	@PikFan	there's also new achievements
2014-05-18 11:54:31	@Espyo	I figured there'd be
2014-05-18 11:54:35	@PikFan	which are
2014-05-18 11:54:38	@PikFan	extremely
2014-05-18 11:54:40	@PikFan	hard
2014-05-18 11:54:57	@PikFan	only Nepeta or other hardcore users like him could achieve these
2014-05-18 11:55:09	@Espyo	heh
2014-05-18 11:55:10	@Espyo	like what?
2014-05-18 11:55:14	@PikFan	and I'd just like to say that I think Orteil has gone crazy
2014-05-18 11:55:15	@Espyo	also, was the cap 56? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cavern_of_Chaos#Sublevel_8
2014-05-18 11:55:18	@PikFan	so
2014-05-18 11:55:22	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-05-18 11:55:31	@PikFan	there's an achievement that you get

2014-05-18 12:09:09	@PikFan	well
2014-05-18 12:09:16	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure a load of people killed everything and then took it back
2014-05-18 12:09:17	@PikFan	sublevel 8 of Cavern of Chaos
2014-05-18 12:09:27	@PikFan	and there were 20 mities
2014-05-18 12:09:27	@Espyo	and in doing so, they had to have noticed a cap

2014-05-18 12:10:09	@Espyo	like make a savestate on that sublevel, next to an egg
2014-05-18 12:10:19	@Espyo	and then keep saving and reloading until the egg releases mitites
2014-05-18 12:10:23	Mariostar123	got my friend code
2014-05-18 12:10:31	@Espyo	and then I can count the enemies when I know mitites will come out
2014-05-18 12:10:34	@Espyo	and then do the math
2014-05-18 12:10:45	@Espyo	Mariostar123, let me see if I have mine handy

2014-05-18 12:11:24	Mariostar123	last night I was brawling on the gamepad by the way
2014-05-18 12:11:36	Mariostar123	but using the classic controller
2014-05-18 12:11:46	@PikFan	but yeah, there were 20 mitites, and 50 or however-many-there-are dwarf bulborbs
2014-05-18 12:12:16	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-18 12:12:32	@PikFan	I'm going to take a guess, the cap is 70
2014-05-18 12:12:54	@PikFan	I was in the last room with alive bulborbs when this happened
2014-05-18 12:13:16	@Espyo	that value's a bit random
2014-05-18 12:13:22	@Espyo	the programmer in me'd say 64
2014-05-18 12:13:27	@Espyo	though it can as easily be 70
2014-05-18 12:13:30	Mariostar123	Espyo,i private messeged my friend code
2014-05-18 12:13:43	@Espyo	it's just a value they judged to be a good balance between quantity and performance
2014-05-18 12:14:03	@PikFan	I suppose

2014-05-18 12:18:10	@Espyo	so we can organize the team battles and whatever
2014-05-18 12:18:15	@Espyo	instead of changing rules without everybody agreeing
2014-05-18 12:18:29	Mariostar123	also,if I annoyed you online *i promise I won't* you can't ban me here.....

2014-05-18 12:21:00	<--	PikFan (Mibbit@u-78-94-868-36.hsd6.or.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: sleep)
2014-05-18 12:21:08	@Espyo	and you didn't annoy, but it was kind of upsetting seeing the rules change without warning
2014-05-18 12:21:18	Mariostar123	k,ill leave them
2014-05-18 12:21:28	Mariostar123	I just get exited
2014-05-18 12:21:39	@Espyo	that's why I'm saying you should find a way to stay contactable somehow
2014-05-18 12:21:58	@Espyo	you can stay on the chatroom on your 3DS, can't you?
2014-05-18 12:22:51	Mariostar123	no
2014-05-18 12:23:35	Mariostar123	should I just always leave it?
2014-05-18 12:23:41	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-18 12:23:49	@Espyo	but like I said, we'll do themed battles
2014-05-18 12:23:50	Mariostar123	and just select a character and stage?
2014-05-18 12:23:55	@Espyo	so if, for instance, we pick Falcon only
2014-05-18 12:23:56	Mariostar123	o....
2014-05-18 12:24:05	@Espyo	there should be a way for us to tell you to pick Falcon as well
2014-05-18 12:24:07	@Espyo	know what I mean?
2014-05-18 12:24:08	Mariostar123	how about taunt messeging?
2014-05-18 12:24:21	Mariostar123	"cpt.falcon"
2014-05-18 12:24:27	Mariostar123	"lolwut"

2014-05-18 12:25:29	@Espyo	no limit to the taunts
2014-05-18 12:26:08	Mariostar123	how about I just sit out and join the next battle then?
2014-05-18 12:26:46	Mariostar123	like if your all samus and im Mario,I drop out a wait for the next one?
2014-05-18 12:27:17	Mariostar123	this chatroom needs music....
2014-05-18 12:27:31	@Espyo	I suppose you could do that
2014-05-18 12:27:37	@Espyo	but you could miss out on a lot of battles that way
2014-05-18 12:27:47	@Espyo	like I said, can't you chat on the 3DS while you play on the Wii U?
2014-05-18 12:27:48	Mariostar123	true....
2014-05-18 12:28:00	Mariostar123	no,the 3DS is to weak

2014-05-18 12:29:05	@Espyo	how is it too weak?
2014-05-18 12:29:23	@Espyo	you only really need to read the messages I send about the next themed battle
2014-05-18 12:29:28	Mariostar123	it can't show caption,java,abode,ect

2014-05-18 21:19:08	@Espyo	we're already messing around, not playing for serious
2014-05-18 21:21:53	@Espyo	that's pretty much a taunt party
2014-05-18 21:21:57	@Espyo	except with more pointless taunts
2014-05-18 21:22:15	MS	why are we killing eachother?
2014-05-18 21:22:30	@Espyo	we were messing around with that thing, where we were getting stuck
2014-05-18 21:22:49	MS	o.....
2014-05-18 21:26:44	MS	G98 keeps killing me....
2014-05-18 21:26:53	@Espyo	it is consequence of the wind
2014-05-18 21:27:02	@Espyo	he's just pulling wind to see what happens to people are stuck
2014-05-18 21:27:43	MS	he just killed me using his up smash as Mario....!
2014-05-18 21:28:47	@Espyo	we're playing normal now
2014-05-18 21:28:51	@Espyo	we're not experimenting here
2014-05-18 21:28:55	@Espyo	we're just messing around
2014-05-18 21:28:58	@Espyo	do you have bumpers off?
2014-05-18 21:30:42	MS	I chose temple
2014-05-18 21:30:49	@Espyo	we're not doing temple any more

2014-05-18 21:31:46	@Espyo	we're killing everybody
2014-05-18 21:32:10	@Espyo	we weren't killing each other back then because we were experimenting with the stuck glitch
2014-05-18 21:32:13	@Espyo	now we're playing normally

2014-05-18 22:04:55	Miles	What
2014-05-18 22:05:07	@Espyo	why stock matches?
2014-05-18 22:05:12	@Espyo	timed matches are superior
2014-05-18 22:05:16	Miles	No
2014-05-18 22:05:45	@Espyo	in timed matches, you don't have to worry about dropping out and having to watch the other players play
2014-05-18 22:05:54	@Espyo	you can focus more on having a good time
2014-05-18 22:06:00	@Espyo	of course, with items
2014-05-18 22:06:02	@Espyo	otherwise, timed
2014-05-18 22:06:50	Miles	I really really don't like having only the killing blow matter for anything
2014-05-18 22:08:31	@Espyo	but that's pretty much true regardless of mode
2014-05-18 22:08:49	MS	*sigh* this is boring now
2014-05-18 22:08:52	Miles	No?
2014-05-18 22:09:00	@Espyo	I've disabled 25.5x damage
2014-05-18 22:09:10	@Espyo	I was meant to disable last match, but couldn't
2014-05-18 22:09:17	MS	seriously,punch,dead. -_-
2014-05-18 22:09:26	@Espyo	in stock matches, you only get KOd with the finishing blow
2014-05-18 22:09:46	Miles	But you got an opponent closer to death
2014-05-18 22:10:09	Miles	You're rewarded for doing damage by them eventually losing a stock
2014-05-18 22:10:27	Miles	In time, if someone else gets the killing blow, well then that was pointless for you
2014-05-18 22:11:08	@Espyo	I guess
2014-05-18 22:11:14	@Espyo	but like I said, more focus on trying to have a blast
2014-05-18 22:11:28	@Espyo	like doing dangerous stuff near the Bulborb and the like
2014-05-18 22:11:37	@Espyo	also delicious KO theft
2014-05-18 22:12:56	@Espyo	and it gives more control over the duration of the match
2014-05-18 22:13:07	MS	who are deku and G98?
2014-05-18 22:13:09	@Espyo	because hey, let's make a hard limit on 3 minutes for replays

2014-05-19 00:24:49	@Espyo	speaking of eggs
2014-05-19 00:24:59	@Espyo	I checked, and sublevel 8 of the CoC has 4 eggs
2014-05-19 00:25:13	@Espyo	and the eggs' contents are randomly picked whenever you break them
2014-05-19 00:25:17	@Espyo	and NOT when you enter the cave
2014-05-19 00:25:28	@Espyo	so technically, with the right timing, you could get every egg to give you Mitites
2014-05-19 00:25:31	@PikFan	well yeah
2014-05-19 00:25:43	@Espyo	that should give a super clear corpse cap

2014-05-19 00:51:14	@PikFan	but yeah
2014-05-19 00:51:24	@Espyo	so basically, you just get eggs at random when you click wrinklers or GCs?

2014-05-19 00:55:19	@Espyo	and I just double-checked, it is NOT an adjective
2014-05-19 00:55:50	@Espyo	is it called "Nectar Egg" in P3?
2014-05-19 00:56:11	@PikFan	not sure
2014-05-19 00:56:39	@PikFan	ok, 1 is Red Bulborb

2014-05-19 01:08:32	@PikFan	I made it
2014-05-19 01:08:43	@Espyo	all right, I guess
2014-05-19 01:08:53	@Espyo	which is the two and which is the three?
2014-05-19 01:08:56	@Espyo	(PP)
2014-05-19 01:09:04	@PikFan	upper is three, lower is two

2014-05-19 01:15:23	@PikFan	np
2014-05-19 01:15:33	@Espyo	all I needed now was to know exactly which file has the data for the content probabilities
2014-05-19 01:16:04	@PikFan	there's also a set in the VoR
2014-05-19 01:16:12	@PikFan	but you know where that is, yes?

2014-05-19 01:21:59	@Espyo	not quite, but I will later
2014-05-19 01:22:06	@PikFan	mm
2014-05-19 01:22:12	@Espyo	it's just that when I added {{Button}}, I checked the wiki for places to use it

2014-05-19 01:22:19	@PikFan	right
2014-05-19 01:22:21	@Espyo	and for every article I didn't know the button of something, I wrote it down
2014-05-19 01:22:27	@Espyo	and now I'm asking for the ones I pointed down
2014-05-19 01:22:31	@PikFan	mm
2014-05-19 01:23:54	@PikFan	also each egg increases my cps by 20 trillion
2014-05-19 01:24:30	@Espyo	wow
2014-05-19 01:24:48	@PikFan	benefit is almost as much as prisms but the eggs cost a billion times less
2014-05-19 01:24:57	@PikFan	(eggs are 1 tril, prisms are 1 sex)
2014-05-19 01:25:15	@Espyo	woah
2014-05-19 01:27:42	@Espyo	when you pause P2, which buttons do you use to switch menus?

2014-05-19 01:32:53	@Espyo	well, what are the entirety of the controls?
2014-05-19 01:33:04	@Espyo	like, what buttons can you press to do what, on the radar?
2014-05-19 01:33:05	@PikFan	well
2014-05-19 01:33:20	@PikFan	you don't use buttons for the radar
2014-05-19 01:33:27	@PikFan	you use your finger or stylus
2014-05-19 01:33:39	@Espyo	oh
2014-05-19 01:33:45	@Espyo	what about zooming in/out/?
2014-05-19 01:33:47	@PikFan	and you can't zoom in

2014-05-19 01:36:45	@PikFan	it's on the GamePad
2014-05-19 01:36:59	@PikFan	if you're using just the GamePad though, you use d-pad down to get to it
2014-05-19 01:37:13	@Espyo	what about all of these things, but for Wii Remote?

2014-05-20 01:41:37	@PikFan	your point being...?
2014-05-20 01:42:20	Mariofan169	Why does a game that simple need a wiki
2014-05-20 01:42:33	@PikFan	Cookie Clicker is not a simple game
2014-05-20 01:42:46	@PikFan	it's pretty complicated once you've gotten to know it
2014-05-20 01:43:40	Mariofan169	Well I guess that's why it has over 150 pages...
2014-05-20 01:45:01	@Espyo	but Hide and Seek is only useful for any session after the one where you get it
2014-05-20 01:45:10	@Espyo	I like how fast the Cookie Clicker wiki is to update
2014-05-20 01:45:13	@Espyo	and how slow it is to update
2014-05-20 01:45:23	@Espyo	the Easter Season article was created really fast
2014-05-20 01:45:30	@Espyo	but the front page is 3 months old
2014-05-20 01:45:56	@PikFan	heh
2014-05-20 01:46:44	Mariofan169	I don't understand humanity

2014-05-20 02:40:19	@Espyo	uh
2014-05-20 02:40:38	@Espyo	I just had a "??? -- Golden Cookies appear shinnier for 3 seconds!" Golden Cookie
2014-05-20 02:42:15	Mariofan169	So
2014-05-20 02:42:34	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-05-20 02:42:41	@PikFan	huh
2014-05-20 02:42:51	@PikFan	I think you got a cookie blab
2014-05-20 02:42:56	Mariofan169	Is there any game on the app store that's NOT garbage?
2014-05-20 02:43:17	@PikFan	http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Cookie?useskin=monobook#Outcomes
2014-05-20 02:44:00	@PikFan	so the quote said "Golden cookie shininess doubled for 3 seconds!" ?
2014-05-20 02:44:35	@Espyo	yep
2014-05-20 02:44:42	@PikFan	mm
2014-05-20 02:44:52	@PikFan	also my wrinklers are invisible
2014-05-20 02:44:54	@PikFan	no idea why
2014-05-20 02:45:06	@PikFan	ok, this is what happened:
2014-05-20 02:45:24	@PikFan	I was on Easter, and decided to go to Christmas to get the reindeer cookies
2014-05-20 02:45:37	@PikFan	when I switched my wrinklers turned invisible
2014-05-20 02:45:48	@Espyo	heh
2014-05-20 02:45:55	@Espyo	because of the Christmas themed wrinklers
2014-05-20 02:46:03	@PikFan	but I refreshed and they're not invisible anymore
2014-05-20 02:46:05	Mariofan169	It seems that every game there either really asks for money like Candy Crush
2014-05-20 02:46:23	@PikFan	of course, that's why they make those games
2014-05-20 02:46:31	@PikFan	they want you to spend money on it
2014-05-20 02:46:36	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-20 02:46:39	@Espyo	in other news...
2014-05-20 02:46:43	@Espyo	just had my final Brawl with my friends
2014-05-20 02:46:49	@Espyo	...sigh, RIP, NWFC
2014-05-20 02:46:59	@PikFan	:'(
2014-05-20 02:47:03	Mariofan169	A very simple game that for some reason everyone plays like flappy bird
2014-05-20 02:47:03	@Espyo	hopefully it won't matter, because apparently private servers are working
2014-05-20 02:47:06	@Espyo	but still...
2014-05-20 02:47:20	@Espyo	flappy bird is like a psychological phenomenom
2014-05-20 02:47:22	@PikFan	why did Nintendo decide to end NWFC
2014-05-20 02:47:33	@Espyo	it wasn't their call
2014-05-20 02:47:33	@PikFan	*phenomenon
2014-05-20 02:47:39	@Espyo	their server — that
2014-05-20 02:47:39	Mariofan169	Or just a piece of garbage like all these kid doctor games
2014-05-20 02:47:53	@Espyo	their server is bound to the GameSpy servers
2014-05-20 02:48:00	@Espyo	and GameSpy is ending in like a week
2014-05-20 02:48:11	@PikFan	oh
2014-05-20 02:48:16	@PikFan	wait, what's GameSpy
2014-05-20 02:48:20	Mariofan169	It doesn't help that ports of classic games are expensive
2014-05-20 02:48:42	@Espyo	it's just a matchmaking service for online games
2014-05-20 02:48:49	Mariofan169	Especially Square Enix's games
2014-05-20 02:48:52	@Espyo	Nintendo could've used their own, but decided not to
2014-05-20 02:49:15	@PikFan	how come Nintendo can't switch services
2014-05-20 02:49:25	@PikFan	money?
2014-05-20 02:49:38	@Espyo	In February 2013, IGN's new owner, Ziff Davis, shut down IGN's "secondary" sites, including GameSpy's network. This was followed by the announcement in April 2014 that GameSpy's service platform will be shut down on May 31, 2014.
2014-05-20 02:49:39	@Espyo	they can
2014-05-20 02:49:42	@Espyo	that's not the problem
2014-05-20 02:49:55	@Espyo	the problem is that Brawl, Mario Kart Wii, etc. are hardcoded to connect to uh...
2014-05-20 02:49:58	@Espyo	servers.gamespy.com
2014-05-20 02:49:59	@Espyo	for instance
2014-05-20 02:50:04	@Espyo	you cannot change that
2014-05-20 02:50:09	@Espyo	you CAN, with hacks
2014-05-20 02:50:13	@Espyo	it's just a value
2014-05-20 02:50:21	@Espyo	with hacks you can make the game connect to google, as far as it cares
2014-05-20 02:50:28	@Espyo	that's why private servers can be connected to with hacks
2014-05-20 02:50:35	@Espyo	Nintendo could create new servers
2014-05-20 02:50:42	@Espyo	but the only way to connect to them would be with hacks
2014-05-20 02:50:46	@PikFan	hmm
2014-05-20 02:50:50	@Espyo	of course they aren't going to tell people to hack to join new servers
2014-05-20 02:51:00	@PikFan	wait, IGN controls GameSpy?
2014-05-20 02:51:04	@Espyo	it does now
2014-05-20 02:51:10	@Espyo	if they had planned ahead, they wouldn't have used the GameSpy service to begin with
2014-05-20 02:51:13	@PikFan	so in other words
2014-05-20 02:51:27	@PikFan	(and this will sound biased)
2014-05-20 02:51:27	@Espyo	or at least they would've bound the address the games connect to to a system setting or something
2014-05-20 02:51:33	@PikFan	IGN dislikes Nintendo
2014-05-20 02:51:35	@Espyo	so that it's not statically servers.gamespy.com forever
2014-05-20 02:51:43	@Espyo	that way they could release a Wii system patch to change the server
2014-05-20 02:51:50	@Espyo	IGN doesn't dislike Nintendo
2014-05-20 02:51:56	@Espyo	they're just retarded and sellouts
2014-05-20 02:52:19	@PikFan	hm, yeah
2014-05-20 02:52:35	@Espyo	>While some publishers have planned to migrate GameSpy-equipped games to other platforms (such as Steamworks or in-house services), some publishers, such as Nintendo (who used the GameSpy servers as the basis of its Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection platform for DS and Wii games) will not, particularly due to the age of the affected games.
2014-05-20 02:52:42	Mariofan169	No they aren't
2014-05-20 02:52:48	@Espyo	>In April 2014, Glu announced that it would shut down the legacy GameSpy servers on May 31, 2014, (server termination was extended until the end of June) [7] so its developers could focus on work for Glu's own services.
2014-05-20 02:53:01	@Espyo	well that sucks, they only shut down the GameSpy matchmaking so they could do other stuff
2014-05-20 02:53:09	@Espyo	"oh, you guys were using our services? lol I don't care"
2014-05-20 02:53:18	@Espyo	sure it's not that black and white, but...
2014-05-20 02:53:18	@PikFan	...........wooooooooow
2014-05-20 02:53:38	Mariofan169	So no more Battlefront 2 multiplayer
2014-05-20 02:53:46	@Espyo	no more loads of games online
2014-05-20 02:53:49	@Espyo	anything Wii and DS, gone
2014-05-20 02:54:01	@Espyo	(maybe one or two indie games might connect to other servers)
2014-05-20 02:54:10	@Espyo	loads of old PC games also won't work
2014-05-20 02:54:18	@Espyo	I remember I needed GameSpy to play Worms 3D online
2014-05-20 02:54:23	@Espyo	...or was it Worms 4?
2014-05-20 02:54:30	@Espyo	oh well...
2014-05-20 02:54:46	@Espyo	here's hoping the private servers work exactly as they should
2014-05-20 02:54:50	@Espyo	anyway, going to bed now
2014-05-20 02:54:52	@Espyo	super late here
2014-05-20 02:54:55	@PikFan	night
2014-05-20 02:55:01	@Espyo	we spent our last matches experimenting with Final Smashes
2014-05-20 02:55:10	@Espyo	namely what happens when somebody disconnects while performing one
2014-05-20 02:55:18	@Espyo	answer: the game handles every case nicely
2014-05-20 02:55:31	@Espyo	so you don't get like leftover glitched particles or anything

2014-05-20 16:19:28	@PikFan	I managed to get my cps up to 5 quad

2014-05-20 16:19:53	@PikFan	5.216 quad right now
2014-05-20 16:20:23	@PikFan	also thanks for adding those Wii U buttons
2014-05-20 16:21:32	@PikFan	and another thing
2014-05-20 16:21:43	@PikFan	got hide and seek champion last night
2014-05-20 16:22:11	@PikFan	I wonder if "egg" really does add 9 cps
2014-05-20 16:24:14	@PikFan	...or 4 billion
2014-05-20 16:27:34	@Espyo	hey
2014-05-20 16:28:22	@Espyo	wow, 5 quad
2014-05-20 16:28:35	@Espyo	I can get like 2 quad with frenzy and no wrinklers
2014-05-20 16:28:43	@Espyo	ah, nice
2014-05-20 16:28:55	@Espyo	and yeah, we were needing the Wii U buttons, so that's done now
2014-05-20 16:28:57	@Espyo	also Classic Controller
2014-05-20 16:29:21	@PikFan	I don't see why we'd need Classic Controller though

2014-05-20 16:34:05	@Espyo	...is there a difference?

2014-05-20 16:38:26	@Espyo	dammit...
2014-05-20 16:38:30	@Espyo	I guess I'll redo later
2014-05-20 16:38:43	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 really is Pro Controller, not Classic, then?
2014-05-20 16:39:10	Miles	Classic Controller is Wii
2014-05-20 16:39:14	Miles	Pro Controller is Wii U
2014-05-20 16:39:41	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-05-20 16:39:51	@Espyo	but you can use the Wii Remote, so I figured the Classic Controller...
2014-05-20 16:40:07	Miles	Nah, very few games support the Classic Controller for some reason
2014-05-20 16:42:37	@Espyo	wow
2014-05-20 16:42:41	@Espyo	all right, fair enough
2014-05-20 16:42:46	@Espyo	I guess I'll make icons eventually
2014-05-20 16:42:56	@Espyo	I was VERY lucky that somebody made a Wii U vectorial image
2014-05-20 16:43:01	@Espyo	I could just get the icons straight away
2014-05-20 16:43:07	@Espyo	here's hoping they did one for the Pro Controller
2014-05-20 16:45:43	@PikFan	alright, gotta go

2014-05-20 17:53:06	@Espyo	these are pretty much the results
2014-05-20 17:53:24	@Espyo	spicies are slightly less common

2014-05-20 20:50:59	@Espyo	or 1-5-10
2014-05-20 20:51:09	@Espyo	but the chances should be the same for each enemy... right?

2014-05-20 20:54:09	@J	oh, you mean the chance for each drop?
2014-05-20 20:54:27	@J	I don't even know if they drop the same number of things each time
2014-05-20 20:58:12	@Espyo	it's always the same number

2014-05-21 15:18:21	Miles	...
2014-05-21 15:20:15	@PikFan	...?
2014-05-21 15:20:45	@PikFan	oh, Espyo
2014-05-21 15:20:56	@PikFan	I had an idea a few days ago
2014-05-21 15:21:10	@Espyo	hey
2014-05-21 15:21:12	@Espyo	oh? do tell
2014-05-21 15:21:27	@PikFan	so in addition to describing where treasures are
2014-05-21 15:21:43	@PikFan	(that is, treasures, ship parts, fruit)
2014-05-21 15:21:54	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-21 15:21:58	@PikFan	we could take pictures of them and put them on their articles
2014-05-21 15:22:18	@PikFan	though I'm not sure that'd work out great with treasures in caves...
2014-05-21 15:22:54	@Espyo	yeah, for the overground ones only
2014-05-21 15:23:03	@Espyo	although...
2014-05-21 15:23:05	@PikFan	hmm
2014-05-21 15:23:14	@Espyo	some treasures are pretty much always in the same places, even underground
2014-05-21 15:23:18	@Espyo	like the chess pieces
2014-05-21 15:23:22	@PikFan	right, like in enemies
2014-05-21 15:23:23	@Espyo	and stuff that's always buried
2014-05-21 15:23:36	@Espyo	I'll add it to the ToDo
2014-05-21 15:23:46	@Espyo	anyway, you farm for sprays every once in a while, right?
2014-05-21 15:23:54	@PikFan	yes?
2014-05-21 15:24:13	@Espyo	how often do you crack open petrified enemies?
2014-05-21 15:24:40	@PikFan	not that often, unless if I feel like harvesting enemies
2014-05-21 15:25:04	@Espyo	it's just that I've cracked a Snow Bulborb on 206 different frames
2014-05-21 15:25:08	@Espyo	and compared the results
2014-05-21 15:25:20	@PikFan	...why 206?
2014-05-21 15:25:27	@Espyo	 85% nectar, 7.5% bitters, 7.5% spicies
2014-05-21 15:25:41	@Espyo	I started by decreasing its health to a sliver
2014-05-21 15:25:46	@Espyo	then I petrified it
2014-05-21 15:25:50	@Espyo	then held a Purple
2014-05-21 15:25:53	@Espyo	and then saved a state
2014-05-21 15:26:02	@Espyo	and then I kept releasing the Purple on different frames
2014-05-21 15:26:09	@Espyo	and I could only do it 206 times before it broke free
2014-05-21 15:26:21	@Espyo	could've stopped at 200, but hey, there were only 6 left, anyway
2014-05-21 15:26:31	@PikFan	I see
2014-05-21 15:26:52	@Espyo	anyway, do those percentages sound right?
2014-05-21 15:27:00	@PikFan	I suppose
2014-05-21 15:27:02	@Espyo	they aren't EXACTLY those values
2014-05-21 15:27:15	@PikFan	sprays don't appear that much
2014-05-21 15:27:21	@Espyo	those are just rounded to what seems right
2014-05-21 15:27:54	@Espyo	 8.25% bitter
2014-05-21 15:28:05	@Espyo	 84.46% nectar
2014-05-21 15:28:15	@Espyo	 7.28% spicy
2014-05-21 15:28:21	@PikFan	but I have to say, I feel like they're a bit more common dropping from enemies than from eggs
2014-05-21 15:28:32	@Espyo	weird
2014-05-21 15:28:39	@Espyo	but I kind of know what you mean, on the other hand
2014-05-21 15:28:45	@Espyo	there was one time I was farming them for whatever reason
2014-05-21 15:28:51	@Espyo	and I just couldn't get any luck from eggs
2014-05-21 15:29:15	@PikFan	mm
2014-05-21 15:29:23	@Espyo	and when you think "spray blob dropping on the ground", you visuallize a petrified enemy being defeated
2014-05-21 15:29:36	@Espyo	then again, that could be bias, because when you see videos and the like, they crack open enemies more than eggs
2014-05-21 15:29:54	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 all eggs% speedrun when?
2014-05-21 15:33:46	@Espyo	well, I'll add it to [[Ultra-bitter spray]]
2014-05-21 15:33:47	Testyo	"Ultra-bitter_spray" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Ultra-bitter_spray
2014-05-21 15:33:56	@Espyo	the stats don't sound very appeasing, but it's the best we got right now
2014-05-21 15:37:43	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-05-21 15:38:17	@PikFan	also cookie clicker wiki went crazy with Easter http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Easter_Season#Unlocking_Eggs
2014-05-21 15:41:27	@Espyo	woah
2014-05-21 15:41:31	@Espyo	we need stuff like that here
2014-05-21 15:41:35	@Espyo	...though not as ridiculous
2014-05-21 15:41:48	@Espyo	there aren't many calculations that are useful to non-developers, though
2014-05-21 15:41:54	@Espyo	I mean, in the Pikmin games

2014-05-21 22:35:51	@Espyo	only to learn that it won't work with shared vertices
2014-05-21 22:37:54	@Espyo	seriously, do NOT pick polygon-based world geometry
2014-05-21 22:37:57	@Espyo	do stick to tiles
2014-05-21 22:38:30	Mariofan169	What's world geometry?
2014-05-21 22:39:10	@Espyo	you know, what defines the world of a game
2014-05-21 22:39:15	@Espyo	what defines the walls, floors and ceilings
2014-05-21 22:39:47	Mariofan169	So what makes up the walls?

2014-05-21 22:44:43	Mariofan169	I think he meant piercing
2014-05-21 22:50:30	@J	managed not to fall off my seat there
2014-05-21 22:51:20	@J	mostly because my seat is currently the floor, but meh

2014-05-23 12:18:49	Chillv	Hi
2014-05-23 12:20:57	@Espyo	hi
2014-05-23 12:22:02	Chillv	I've only had 3 hours of sleep, because of a cold keeping me up :(
2014-05-23 12:24:12	@Espyo	it's like universal now
2014-05-23 12:24:18	@Espyo	everybody I know has a cold of some form
2014-05-23 12:24:27	@Espyo	I wake up and have to blow my nose for like 4 Pacific Oceans
2014-05-23 12:28:26	Chillv	I haven't play Pikmin in a while. I constantly try to replay Pikmin 2, but get disinterested. Like, it was fun when playing for the first time, but now it's... ugh. It's mostly because of the caves.
2014-05-23 12:29:40	Chillv	The caves are cool at first, but eventually they start to become overwhelming and way too similar. Not to mention some floors are randomly generated, which I don't really like.
2014-05-23 12:32:27	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2014-05-23 12:32:29	@Espyo	I know what you mean
2014-05-23 12:33:56	Chillv	And this becomes very notable once you reach the end of the game
2014-05-23 12:34:29	Chillv	I found Pikmin 1 and Pikmin 3 to be more replayable at least for me.
2014-05-23 12:36:07	@Espyo	in Pikmin 1 you can always retry and try to get better scores
2014-05-23 12:37:30	Chillv	and you can try to get less deaths and finish in a lower amount of days
2014-05-23 12:38:18	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-23 12:39:31	Chillv	Pikmin 3 is great too, it's very balanced. Nothing feels overpowered or underpowered.
2014-05-23 12:39:52	@Espyo	nice
2014-05-23 12:39:57	@Espyo	still have to buy a Wii U...
2014-05-23 12:42:09	Chillv	I already have a Wii U, and pretty much have every notable first party title for it.
2014-05-23 12:42:28	@Espyo	are you planning on getting MK8?
2014-05-23 12:42:36	Chillv	Yes, on launch day
2014-05-23 12:43:18	@Espyo	nice
2014-05-23 12:43:41	Chillv	I also plan on getting Tomodachi Life for 3DS, I was so excited when I found that it was being released in America.
2014-05-23 12:43:59	@Espyo	I'm still not really sure what Tomodachi Life is
2014-05-23 12:44:16	Chillv	I can explain it for you
2014-05-23 12:44:24	Chillv	if you want
2014-05-23 12:44:31	@Espyo	please do
2014-05-23 12:44:39	@Espyo	I'm just really confused about it
2014-05-23 12:45:59	Chillv	Basically, you put miis in the game, and you can customize their voice and personality traits. They all live in a apartment in their own separate rooms
2014-05-23 12:46:51	Chillv	You can go into the apartment to check on them, and they will ask you to solve certain problems for them
2014-05-23 12:47:48	@Espyo	oh
2014-05-23 12:47:55	@Espyo	hmm, still doesn't really explain the giant Reggie head coming from the ocean
2014-05-23 12:48:12	Chillv	the "problems" could be associated with relationships or something simple such as wanting new clothing
2014-05-23 12:48:53	Chillv	Oh, the giant heads from the beach dock?
2014-05-23 12:49:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-05-23 12:49:26	Chillv	Well, during late or really early hours, the miis will be sleeping, and they may have a dream.
2014-05-23 12:49:41	Chillv	that is one of the possible dreams they can have
2014-05-23 12:50:06	@Espyo	oh, haha
2014-05-23 12:50:09	@Espyo	all right, makes sense then
2014-05-23 12:50:10	@Espyo	thanks
2014-05-23 12:51:15	Chillv	The dreams are really weird
2014-05-23 12:52:37	Chillv	Also, the part where the dudes face expands outside the globe is dream where someone tells them something they just can't believe.
2014-05-23 12:53:29	@Espyo	hah
2014-05-23 12:54:36	Chillv	Basically, anything that is way too surreal is most likely a dream in the game and not anything real
2014-05-23 12:54:43	@Espyo	right
2014-05-23 12:56:19	Chillv	Also, the heavy metal band are one o the songs that you can make the miis perform, that is if you can them the sheet music for it.
2014-05-23 12:56:52	Chillv	Which you can only give them by leveling them up
2014-05-23 12:58:12	@Espyo	I see
2014-05-23 13:02:38	Chillv	This basically sums up this game: It's a game where you watch drama happen and take part in it too.
2014-05-23 13:03:35	@Espyo	ah, fair enough
2014-05-23 13:05:19	Chillv	Also, that part where bill and reggie are fighting over a bear in the rain... The rain is not real, that is just an interior that can be set to their room.
2014-05-23 13:05:52	Chillv	hold on, I need to refresh

2014-05-23 18:45:21	@Espyo	did you check the ban shenanigans from yesterday?
2014-05-23 19:09:46	@J	nope
2014-05-23 19:09:57	@J	summary for lazy person?
2014-05-23 19:10:18	@J	(and also for me)
2014-05-23 19:12:50	@Espyo	this ip asked me to ban them
2014-05-23 19:13:03	@Espyo	then created an account, saying they prefer I ban the account, not the IP
2014-05-23 19:13:06	@Espyo	(same thing, but whatever)
2014-05-23 19:13:10	@Espyo	so I just did it
2014-05-23 19:13:14	@Espyo	then I notice Porple's online
2014-05-23 19:13:19	@Espyo	I ask if this was him testing stuff
2014-05-23 19:13:26	@Espyo	he replies today saying it wasn't him
2014-05-23 19:13:36	@Espyo	and I'm just wating hard through the whole thing
2014-05-23 19:13:45	@J	wating?
2014-05-23 19:14:14	@J	I would generally assume someone asking for a ban is trying to get someone else banned
2014-05-23 19:15:20	@Espyo	you know, going "wat"
2014-05-23 19:15:26	@J	oh
2014-05-23 19:15:31	@Espyo	likely, yeah
2014-05-23 19:15:41	@J	oh, but the guy actually gave a reason
2014-05-23 19:15:44	@Espyo	but with this spammer going around, I just didn't even care
2014-05-23 19:15:45	@Espyo	he did?
2014-05-23 19:15:56	@J	you know, the stuff on your talk?
2014-05-23 19:16:07	@Espyo	I know I skimmed over it, but...
2014-05-23 19:16:13	@J	'I need to see the word "autoblock" and how it's used.' - not sure what it means, but...
2014-05-23 19:16:34	@Espyo	oh, that one, yeah
2014-05-23 19:16:41	@Espyo	yeah, I didn't really chalk that up as an explanation
2014-05-23 19:16:46	@Espyo	"Actually just block this account. That way this IP address is autoblocked." also doesn't help
2014-05-23 19:16:59	@Espyo	sure seems like somebody testing stuff, but...
2014-05-23 19:17:10	@Espyo	just hope it's not the spammer trying to come up with ways around bans

2014-05-23 21:35:55	Mariofan169	?
2014-05-23 21:35:57	@Espyo	visual studio has this thing where you can mouse-over variable names and get their current value, while stepping through code
2014-05-23 21:36:07	@Espyo	without this it's impossible to debug some things effectively
2014-05-23 21:36:13	@Espyo	problem is it randomly decides it doesn't recognize the variables

2014-05-24 19:39:02	@Espyo	did you patrol those edits yet?
2014-05-24 19:39:05	@Espyo	there are a few P3 ones
2014-05-24 19:39:11	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-05-24 19:39:12	@PikFan	oh
2014-05-24 19:39:17	@Espyo	in other news, my area editor now has a lot of complex geometry
2014-05-24 19:39:22	@Espyo	and everything is fine and simple
2014-05-24 19:39:24	@PikFan	hooray
2014-05-24 19:39:32	@Espyo	but detecting if a point is inside a triangle?
2014-05-24 19:39:35	@PikFan	...but that's not possible
2014-05-24 19:39:37	@Espyo	apparently mere mortals cannot do that
2014-05-24 19:39:44	@Espyo	it is possible, but ONLY if it doesn't work at first
2014-05-24 19:39:45	@PikFan	how can it be simple and complex
2014-05-24 19:39:55	@Espyo	the underlying mechanics are simple
2014-05-24 19:40:07	@Espyo	I tried Googling how to determine whether a point is in a triangle
2014-05-24 19:40:09	@Espyo	basic geometry
2014-05-24 19:40:14	@Espyo	but it's just rocket science
2014-05-24 19:40:18	@Espyo	anything else in my code is easy
2014-05-24 19:40:21	@Espyo	how even
2014-05-24 19:40:24	@Espyo	J: how do I triangle
2014-05-24 19:40:39	@Espyo	surely you had to have calculated whether a point is in a triangle, before
2014-05-24 19:41:22	@PikFan	...oh boy
2014-05-24 19:41:32	@PikFan	there are unpatrolled edits from April
2014-05-24 19:41:45	@Espyo	oh?

2014-05-24 19:42:38	@PikFan	now I changed my preferences to see 91 days
2014-05-24 19:42:48	@Espyo	why 91?
2014-05-24 19:43:16	@PikFan	to see if there are any more
2014-05-24 19:43:28	@Espyo	yeah, but why not 90?
2014-05-24 19:43:32	@PikFan	...oh, nope
2014-05-24 19:43:36	@PikFan	91's the max
2014-05-24 19:44:05	Mariofan169	That's oddly specific
2014-05-24 19:44:36	@PikFan	nah, not really

2014-05-24 19:46:03	Mariofan169	Not that
2014-05-24 19:46:08	Mariofan169	Why 91?

2014-05-24 19:46:18	Mariofan169	Why not 90?
2014-05-24 19:46:25	@PikFan	I just said
2014-05-24 19:46:29	Mariofan169	I'm just nitpicking here though
2014-05-24 19:46:29	@PikFan	91's the max
2014-05-24 19:46:57	@Espyo	hm, weird
2014-05-24 19:49:31	@J	 hmm, not sure what the 'standard' way to do it is, but I guess I would check if it's directly above at least one of the 3 line segments, and directly below at least one
2014-05-24 19:49:36	@PikFan	...huh
2014-05-24 19:49:37	@J	I think that should work
2014-05-24 19:49:52	@J	even for vertical edges
2014-05-24 19:49:53	@PikFan	"It is possible that Arachnodes are a part of or related to the [[Arachnorb]] family due to the fact that they share features such as being orb shaped and being split in the middle vertically."
2014-05-24 19:49:53	Testyo	"Arachnorb" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Arachnorb
2014-05-24 19:50:09	@PikFan	but Arachnodes have 8 legs, and Arachnorbs have 4
2014-05-24 19:50:16	@PikFan	they're much smaller, too
2014-05-24 19:50:35	@J	you'll get floating-point errors if it's very near a vertex horizontally, even if the vertex is in the middle of the triangle horizontally, so maybe allow for some overlap
2014-05-24 19:51:40	@Espyo	that won't work...
2014-05-24 19:52:00	@J	why not?
2014-05-24 19:52:37	@Espyo	or rather, it can work
2014-05-24 19:52:46	@Espyo	but I'd have to teach it how to recognize "above" and "below" a line
2014-05-24 19:53:13	@J	I phrased the solution that way because that's so simple to do
2014-05-24 19:53:25	@Espyo	tell me your secrets, then
2014-05-24 19:53:43	@Espyo	if you found a simple way to know whether a point is above or below a line, you've reinvented geometry forever
2014-05-24 19:54:02	@J	you just work out what the line's y co-ordinate is at the point's x
2014-05-24 19:54:26	@Espyo	...oh yeah
2014-05-24 19:54:31	@Espyo	there's an equation for that, isn't there?
2014-05-24 19:55:19	@Espyo	wait, I think you're describing the "best answer" in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2049582/how-to-determine-a-point-in-a-triangle

2014-05-24 19:57:45	@J	it's hard to tell when it's all optimised
2014-05-24 20:00:53	@Espyo	looks like it is
2014-05-24 20:01:02	@Espyo	yeah, it is
2014-05-24 20:01:17	@Espyo	I tried running a speed comparison between that method and one lower down in the page
2014-05-24 20:01:21	@Espyo	and the one lower is faster
2014-05-24 20:01:26	@Espyo	so I guess I'll stick with that
2014-05-24 20:01:29	@Espyo	thanks
2014-05-24 20:01:37	@Espyo	anyway, you need to delete those pages
2014-05-24 20:01:44	@Espyo	also the user pages, while we're at it
2014-05-24 20:03:19	@Espyo	I was actually using yet another method on that page
2014-05-24 20:03:29	@Espyo	but it turned out that it was undefined on edge cases
2014-05-24 20:03:36	@Espyo	and I couldn't be bothered to try to understand why
2014-05-24 20:03:46	@Espyo	I just want to calculate one of humanity's simplest problems
2014-05-24 20:06:31	@PikFan	should I rollback these edits http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Captain_Olimar&diff=next&oldid=80564 and http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Captain_Olimar&diff=next&oldid=80565

2014-05-24 20:08:43	@J	you could probably make this thing really fast by using ints
2014-05-24 20:08:54	@Espyo	noooooooooooo
2014-05-24 20:08:57	@Espyo	but I use floats
2014-05-24 20:09:14	@J	that doesn't make me wrong
2014-05-24 20:09:19	@Espyo	indeed
2014-05-24 20:09:27	@Espyo	hmmmm, I might actually be able to just use ints
2014-05-24 20:09:28	@J	why do you need them to be floats?
2014-05-24 20:09:40	@Espyo	 1 unit = 1 pixel at 1x zoom
2014-05-24 20:09:47	@Espyo	so if you zoom in, you could need sub-stuff
2014-05-24 20:09:55	@Espyo	eh, I probably don't need floats, do I
2014-05-24 20:10:08	@J	wait, you're doing collisions and stuff based on the zoom level?
2014-05-24 20:10:09	@Espyo	forget my "sub-stuff" message, that was stupid
2014-05-24 20:10:12	@Espyo	no no
2014-05-24 20:10:15	@Espyo	not even collisions yet
2014-05-24 20:10:30	@Espyo	I think positions of objects should be floats
2014-05-24 20:10:38	@Espyo	but for areas, vertices should be ints
2014-05-24 20:10:46	@J	yeah
2014-05-24 20:11:34	@J	it'd probably still be faster to make ints from positions before the intersection test
2014-05-24 20:11:52	@J	maybe even if you round it, not sure how accurate you need it
2014-05-24 20:12:05	@Espyo	yes, but it makes me wonder about accuracy
2014-05-24 20:12:34	@Espyo	right now, I think it's too early to think about it anyway
2014-05-24 20:12:35	@PikFan	done

2014-05-24 20:12:52	@PikFan	unpatrolled edits are duckman's pages
2014-05-24 20:12:53	@J	normally you're the one obsessing about speed and optimisations
2014-05-24 20:13:05	@J	so all I have to do is use reverse psychology?
2014-05-24 20:13:08	@J	*makes a note*
2014-05-24 20:13:25	@Espyo	right NOW it's too early
2014-05-24 20:13:32	@Espyo	I'll optimize llike crazy later, don't you worry
2014-05-24 20:13:42	@J	right now is when you normally worry
2014-05-24 20:13:55	@Espyo	I guess, but right now now now, I just want to complete the area editor
2014-05-24 20:14:33	@J	I guess the difference is, when you normally ask for help with algorithms, the context is obvious
2014-05-24 20:15:06	@J	here it's not, so I have no idea how much it'll get used, so I think maybe its speed will actually matter
2014-05-24 20:15:43	@Espyo	hmm
2014-05-24 20:16:03	@Espyo	all right, so in order to draw a polygon, I have to triangulate it
2014-05-24 20:16:14	@Espyo	because OpenGL doesn't do concave polygons
2014-05-24 20:16:50	@Espyo	plus, I need to check if a point is inside a triangle on the editor
2014-05-24 20:17:02	@Espyo	if for instance, I want to create a new polygon inside another one
2014-05-24 20:17:06	@Espyo	also in-game, for teleportations
2014-05-24 20:17:13	@Espyo	for regular collisions, it checks the lines, that's fine
2014-05-24 20:17:22	@Espyo	but teleportation will have to check which triangle the point belongs to

2014-05-25 01:32:22	@Espyo	I stopped trying to make sense out of Pikmin 2's game files
2014-05-25 01:32:27	@Espyo	the object numbers make no sense now
2014-05-25 01:32:40	@Espyo	tonight, I went on a quest to double-check all numbers I wasn't sure of
2014-05-25 01:32:48	@Espyo	and almost every one turned up to be something very different

2014-05-25 01:36:58	@Espyo	and I found a tiny glitch
2014-05-25 01:37:06	@Espyo	HOPEFULLY, it'll actually be a massive exploit
2014-05-25 01:40:45	@Espyo	awww...

2014-05-25 20:14:23	@PikFan	J, you still need to delete some userpages
2014-05-25 20:14:50	@PikFan	GIVE ME YOUR PASSWORD, Pikmin Wiki, and Bleer
2014-05-25 20:15:43	@PikFan	Espyo: in Cookie Clicker I recently noticed that my cps is increasing
2014-05-25 20:15:56	@Espyo	there's an egg that increases it the longer you play
2014-05-25 20:16:04	@PikFan	right, the Century Egg
2014-05-25 20:16:22	@Espyo	how fast is the increase?
2014-05-25 20:16:37	@PikFan	negligible 
2014-05-25 20:16:53	@Espyo	bleh
2014-05-25 20:17:08	@PikFan	to see it you have to turn short numbers off
2014-05-25 20:17:34	@PikFan	yeah, cps just went up by 1 billion
2014-05-25 20:18:02	@PikFan	anyway, I thought that the egg would increase your cps at certain times
2014-05-25 20:18:07	@PikFan	not gradually
2014-05-25 20:18:29	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2014-05-25 20:19:24	@PikFan	so I heard that it will increase your cps by 1% at certain times, up to 10% by 100 days
2014-05-25 20:20:01	@PikFan	so after x amount of time passed, your cps would increase by 1%
2014-05-25 20:20:43	@Espyo	oh, I see
2014-05-25 20:21:14	@PikFan	also, my cps is almost 6 quad
2014-05-25 20:21:27	@PikFan	I'm hoping to reach 20 sex in this session
2014-05-25 20:21:30	@PikFan	maybe more
2014-05-25 20:22:33	@Espyo	I might be close
2014-05-25 20:22:41	@Espyo	if I pop these wrinklers, I'll get...
2014-05-25 20:22:43	@Espyo	oh, 2 sex

2014-05-25 20:23:17	@Espyo	let me try opening one
2014-05-25 20:23:21	@PikFan	I see
2014-05-25 20:24:04	@PikFan	you might know this already, but refreshing will average out how many cookies each wrinkler has eaten
2014-05-25 20:24:58	@Espyo	uh, I get 100 quint from popping one
2014-05-25 20:25:03	@Espyo	so I'll get a sex
