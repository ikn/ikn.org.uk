2016-12-29 22:44:05	@Espyo	you could always try a Pikmin 2 MIDI
2016-12-29 22:44:07	@Espyo	fan-made, of course
2016-12-29 22:44:14	@Espyo	no wizard has managed to convert the game's files to MIDI yet...
2016-12-29 22:44:48	Yoshi2	a reminder that i should get back to it at some point
2016-12-29 22:46:50	Yoshi2	the revelation that note on events could be 5 bytes sometimes screwed all plans up
2016-12-29 22:47:19	@Espyo	crud
2016-12-29 22:47:35	Yoshi2	also where did scruffy go?
2016-12-29 22:47:57	Marty2000	Maybe he's on Discord?
2016-12-29 22:48:00	Yoshi2	his out of the box thinking mind was really useful
2016-12-29 22:49:02	Yoshi2	I don't think I've seen him on discord in a while
2016-12-29 22:50:32	@Espyo	Marty2000: I still have this pointed down to add to the wiki http://pastebin.com/raw/06pGU2Wg
2016-12-29 22:50:41	@Espyo	what game are you referring to on the first line?
2016-12-29 22:52:02	Marty2000	P1 and P2
2016-12-29 22:52:24	@Espyo	all right
2016-12-29 22:52:45	Marty2000	The Onions in P3 automatically spit out a seed when a particular Pikmin type is extinct
2016-12-29 22:52:57	@Espyo	!
2016-12-29 22:53:02	@Espyo	here's something we gotta test
2016-12-29 22:53:10	@Espyo	have, for instance, 5 Blue Pikmin in total
2016-12-29 22:53:17	@Espyo	bring those 5 out, and 95 Rock Pikmin
2016-12-29 22:53:26	@Espyo	take the Blue Pikmin to a gray candypop bud
2016-12-29 22:53:28	@Espyo	and swap them out
2016-12-29 22:53:31	@Espyo	what will the game do then?
2016-12-29 22:53:38	Marty2000	Oh, nice
2016-12-29 22:53:44	Marty2000	Yeah, gotta try
2016-12-29 22:53:46	@Espyo	gah, the rules for extinction are SO complex
2016-12-29 22:53:47	Marty2000	I can check now
2016-12-29 22:53:53	@Espyo	oh, please do
2016-12-29 22:54:01	@Espyo	...if you don't have like 5000 Pikmin of each type
2016-12-29 22:54:06	@Espyo	otherwise it'll take a while
2016-12-29 22:54:13	Marty2000	Yeah, lol, I'm gonna check all my save files
2016-12-29 22:54:24	@Espyo	(disclaimer: I'm not sure, but I think gray candypop buds don't exist in story mode D:)
2016-12-29 22:54:30	Marty2000	They do
2016-12-29 22:54:35	@Espyo	oh, my bad
2016-12-29 22:54:36	Marty2000	at the Tropical Wilds
2016-12-29 22:54:39	@Espyo	wasn't there one type that doesn't?
2016-12-29 22:54:44	@Espyo	oh yeah, because of the Crushblat
2016-12-29 22:55:00	Marty2000	All types have their Candypop at least once
2016-12-29 22:55:06	Marty2000	(Formidable Oak)
2016-12-29 22:55:10	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-12-29 22:56:26	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-12-29 22:56:44	Marty2000	Hmmm... I have only 114 Yellow Pikmin on my main save, so I'll just drown 109 of them, take 5 out with 95 Winged Pikmin, and see what happens
2016-12-29 22:56:49	Marty2000	Bye Yoshi2
2016-12-29 22:56:53	Yoshi2|offline	night
2016-12-29 22:56:54	@Espyo	that works
2016-12-29 22:56:57	@Espyo	night Yoshi2
2016-12-29 23:04:54	Marty2000	Since there are 100 Pikmin on field, the seed appeared in the Onion (wasn't ejected)
2016-12-29 23:05:51	Marty2000	As soon as I threw the last Yellow Pikmin in the Candypop Bud, the cutscene triggered, and I went to the Onion to check where the seed was, and it was in the Onion
2016-12-29 23:06:18	@Espyo	nice

2016-12-30 19:00:14	Marty2000	Hello, Espyo
2016-12-30 19:01:04	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-30 19:04:07	Yoshi2	hi Espyo 
2016-12-30 19:05:48	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-30 19:24:05	Marty2000	Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin#No_drowning on the Gamecube version, is the Pikmin planted underwater? Do you have to pluck it?
2016-12-30 19:24:17	@Espyo	no idea
2016-12-30 19:24:21	@Espyo	somebody added that and never really expanded
2016-12-30 19:24:46	Marty2000	Because if so, then it doesn't work in the Wii version. I don't know if it swims infinitely, since I got my Pikmin eaten a second after the Snitchbug "planted" it underwater
2016-12-30 19:25:04	Marty2000	It wasn't really planted: it automatically started drowning...
2016-12-30 19:25:07	Marty2000	I see
2016-12-30 19:26:19	@Espyo	I think I tried to replicate it on the GC, but couldn't
2016-12-30 19:27:39	Marty2000	I see. I honestly hope that glitch does exist :P
2016-12-30 19:31:07	Marty2000	Espyo: doesn't work, the Pikmin drowned
2016-12-30 19:31:26	Marty2000	But it's the Wii version, so...
2016-12-30 19:32:09	@Espyo	can you please try GC?
2016-12-30 19:32:12	Marty2000	And I just got a new glitch with the Snitchbug, lol
2016-12-30 19:32:20	@Espyo	oh, heh
2016-12-30 19:32:21	Marty2000	Okay (it'll be on Dolphin though)
2016-12-30 19:32:22	@Espyo	can't wait then
2016-12-30 19:32:27	@Espyo	Dolphin should be fine
2016-12-30 19:32:55	Marty2000	If you throw a Pikmin just as the Snitchbug grabs it, the Pikmin will float in mid-air (and stay idle): let me take a screenshot
2016-12-30 19:32:57	Marty2000	Okay ;)
2016-12-30 19:34:15	@Espyo	oh, wait
2016-12-30 19:34:25	@Espyo	oh, no, I thought that was familiar
2016-12-30 19:34:32	@Espyo	so you've got the Pikmin floating in mid-air due to fire geysers
2016-12-30 19:34:34	@Espyo	now this
2016-12-30 19:34:38	@Espyo	you have to add these to the wiki!
2016-12-30 19:34:40	Marty2000	That is even weirder: if you lie down, the Pikmin will try to carr you, but will fall to the ground and be buried
2016-12-30 19:34:50	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-30 19:34:59	Marty2000	And instead of a screenshot, it'll be a video
2016-12-30 19:35:22	Marty2000	Just trying the glitch on Dolphin and then I'll add all of these
2016-12-30 19:37:15	@Espyo	wat lol
2016-12-30 19:41:24	Marty2000	Espyo: the Pikmin wasn't planted, it just started drowning...
2016-12-30 19:41:29	Marty2000	Fake?
2016-12-30 19:41:45	@Espyo	I don't want to say yes... since I doubt people would make this stuff up
2016-12-30 19:41:49	@Espyo	but since it can't be reproduced...
2016-12-30 19:41:52	@Espyo	I think it's better
2016-12-30 19:42:03	@Espyo	if somebody can get it to happen in the future, it can be better documented then
2016-12-30 19:42:11	@Espyo	but for now, I think it's best deleted
2016-12-30 19:42:41	Marty2000	Ok, I'll delete it as I'm adding the glitches
2016-12-30 19:42:42	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/XKTa4aRoe8o
2016-12-30 19:57:13	Marty2000	Espyo: added the glitches and deleted the other one
2016-12-30 19:58:16	Marty2000	It reminds me of the Beady Long Legs glitch, which I've never managed to reproduce. No footage of it either. I wonder who "found" this glitch too :P
2016-12-30 19:58:47	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-12-30 20:44:44	@Espyo	ok, I wrote this down to help document every single behavior http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Espyo/extinction
2016-12-30 20:44:53	@Espyo	because our current extinction page STILL doesn't mention a lot of behaviors
2016-12-30 20:45:02	@Espyo	thoughts?
2016-12-30 20:54:06	Marty2000	It needs to be completed, of course, but it's a good idea
2016-12-30 20:55:15	@Espyo	can you think of any more scenarios?
2016-12-30 20:57:20	Marty2000	"Outside, 99 Yellows + 1 Red in the area, swap your last Red for a Yellow." Hack P2 and put a Candypop Bud above ground, and try
2016-12-30 20:57:23	Marty2000	Otherwise, I don't know

2016-12-30 21:03:42	@Espyo	oh, but
2016-12-30 21:03:45	@Espyo	nothing will happen in P2
2016-12-30 21:03:49	Marty2000	Okay (sorry, got disconnected)
2016-12-30 21:03:50	@Espyo	since the game doesn't care what you do mid-day
2016-12-30 21:04:00	Marty2000	Yes
2016-12-30 21:04:03	@Espyo	only if you get a total extinction, or when the next day starts, does anything even happen
2016-12-30 21:05:12	Marty2000	But imagine, you have 100 Blue Pikmin buried somehwere, and you lose all your Yellow Pikmin. If you land in that area, will the seed appear in the Onion? Be ejected? Or nothing at all?
2016-12-30 21:05:45	Marty2000	It's possible to have 100 Pikmin buried somewhere, I think, but quite hard...
2016-12-30 21:05:53	Marty2000	hmmm, I could maybe try with Toady Bloysters
2016-12-30 21:06:05	Marty2000	I'll try in a few hours
2016-12-30 21:06:10	Marty2000	I need to restart a save for that :P
2016-12-30 21:07:23	@Espyo	Toady Bloysters?
2016-12-30 21:07:30	@Espyo	how would those create seeds?
2016-12-30 21:07:37	@Espyo	I mean, besides their corpse <_>
2016-12-30 21:07:58	@Espyo	but yeah, that's also a scenario, but it's like "next-day scenario", instead of "extinction scenario"
2016-12-30 21:08:01	@Espyo	not sure where to put it
2016-12-30 21:11:23	Marty2000	Their tail creates 25 seeds. I can just have 97 Pikmin planted on ground, bring the tail, and have enough time for the Pikmin to get back into their Onions
2016-12-30 21:29:53	@Espyo	you can use Snitchbugs :P
2016-12-30 21:31:48	@Espyo	also, Marty2000: didn't you say Rocks being thrown and Rocks lunging are the same for gates?

2016-12-30 22:32:22	Marty2000	Okay ;)
2016-12-30 22:37:31	Marty2000	Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty/Seed#Others "in Pikmin 2, it is impossible to have 100 Pikmin buried in the same area" Sorry, your idea will partially work :/
2016-12-30 22:37:49	@Espyo	oh
2016-12-30 22:37:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-30 22:37:54	@Espyo	forgot about that, heh
2016-12-30 22:38:02	Marty2000	I forgot too, heh
2016-12-30 22:41:22	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-12-30 22:55:12	Marty2000	Espyo: "Outside, 99 Yellows + 1 Red in the area, swap your last Red for a Yellow." In P1, if you land in the same area, the red will appear in the Onion
2016-12-30 22:55:33	Marty2000	Same in P3 (tested yesterday)
2016-12-30 22:56:33	@Espyo	huh? that doesn't make sense
2016-12-30 22:58:26	Marty2000	Why? The seed of the extinct Pikmin (the Red Pikmin species) will appear in the Onion, since there are 100 Pikmin already on field
2016-12-30 22:59:55	Marty2000	If you choose to land in another area, the Onion will spit out a seed depending on whether you have a Pikmin of its type buried in that area or not
2016-12-30 23:00:09	Marty2000	If there's a Pikmin of that type, then no seed is ejected
2016-12-30 23:00:16	Marty2000	if no, then it'll eject a seed
2016-12-30 23:04:24	@Espyo	in P1, no seed is meant to come out until the day ends...
2016-12-30 23:04:45	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-12-30 23:04:46	@Espyo	I get you
2016-12-30 23:05:04	Marty2000	Yeah, I ended the day, sorry :P
2016-12-30 23:05:10	Marty2000	I forgot to mention it
2016-12-30 23:40:10	Marty2000	Espyo: I am close to getting 100 red Pikmin buried at the Perplexing Pool
2016-12-30 23:40:29	@Espyo	but
2016-12-30 23:40:33	@Espyo	I thought it wasn't possible?
2016-12-30 23:40:38	Marty2000	I have a single Yellow Pikmin awaiting its death and a White Pikmin ready to bring a corpse to the Red Onion
2016-12-30 23:40:52	Marty2000	by bringing a corpse to an Onion, the Onion will eject seeds
2016-12-30 23:41:01	Marty2000	it's only possible if the Onion ejects seeds
2016-12-30 23:41:05	@Espyo	right
2016-12-30 23:41:10	@Espyo	please add this to the seed article asap
2016-12-30 23:41:19	@Espyo	this "suck corpse in and then send Pikmin inside" thing
2016-12-30 23:41:24	Marty2000	A Mamuta/Snitchbug can't bury 100 Pikmin, only 99, but the Onion can make the 100th
2016-12-30 23:41:39	Marty2000	Yes
2016-12-30 23:44:00	Marty2000	Ok, no Yellow Pikmin left, 100 Red Pikmin buried.
2016-12-30 23:44:24	@Espyo	cool
2016-12-30 23:44:41	Marty2000	The Yellow Onion ejected a seed!
2016-12-30 23:44:50	Marty2000	it didn't appear IN the Onion
2016-12-30 23:45:03	Marty2000	like in the other games...
2016-12-30 23:46:23	@Espyo	oh WOW
2016-12-30 23:48:41	Marty2000	One of the buried Pikmin gets sent back to its Onion, I suppose
2016-12-30 23:48:59	@Espyo	mhm
2016-12-30 23:51:30	@Espyo	we HAVE to add this info to the wiki
2016-12-30 23:51:33	@Espyo	it cannot go forgotten
2016-12-30 23:51:43	@Espyo	guess I'll add it to my loose notes
2016-12-30 23:52:52	Marty2000	:P
2016-12-30 23:52:55	Marty2000	Okay
2016-12-30 23:53:07	Marty2000	Yeah, I think it's best if you add it to your notes/table for now
2016-12-30 23:53:34	Marty2000	So that we can solve the rest first
2016-12-30 23:53:38	@Espyo	mhm
2016-12-30 23:54:00	@Espyo	the game probably picks the one farthest from the Onion
2016-12-30 23:54:07	@Espyo	I wouldn't be surprised at all if P2 uses the same logic as P1
2016-12-30 23:54:10	@Espyo	and P3
2016-12-30 23:54:12	@Espyo	or at least very similar
2016-12-30 23:55:41	@Espyo	so, it likely removes the buried Pikmin farthest from the Onion
2016-12-30 23:55:52	Marty2000	I'll check now
2016-12-30 23:56:01	@Espyo	plus, they probably had that logic worked out carefully because the game WAS initially meant to have the Onions pop out
2016-12-30 23:56:02	Marty2000	I just have to kill the Yellow and repeat the process, so...
2016-12-30 23:56:05	@Espyo	and likely spit a seed as well
2016-12-30 23:56:11	@Espyo	cool
2016-12-30 23:56:16	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-30 23:56:36	@Espyo	but can you tell which of all buried Pikmin is the farther?
2016-12-30 23:56:38	@Espyo	*farthest
2016-12-30 23:56:46	Marty2000	I think I can
2016-12-30 23:56:53	@Espyo	I was thinking you should get some 40 or so seeds from Toady Bloysters
2016-12-30 23:57:00	@Espyo	then bury one Pikmin really far away using a Snitchbug
2016-12-30 23:57:06	@Espyo	and then continue with TB seeds
2016-12-30 23:57:29	@Espyo	aren't all of your seeds around the Red Onion?
2016-12-30 23:57:29	Marty2000	I'll try if I can't figure out which Pikmin is the farthest
2016-12-30 23:57:36	Marty2000	I need to unlock Blue Pikmin
2016-12-30 23:57:37	Marty2000	No
2016-12-30 23:57:42	@Espyo	oh? where are they then?
2016-12-30 23:57:50	Marty2000	Some are around the Red Onion, some are around the Snitchbug
2016-12-30 23:57:54	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-12-30 23:57:58	@Espyo	then it should work, yeah
2016-12-31 00:01:33	Marty2000	Ending the day and checking
2016-12-31 00:02:40	Marty2000	Yep, Espyo!
2016-12-31 00:02:49	Marty2000	The farthest Pikmin gets removed
2016-12-31 00:03:06	@Espyo	hah!
2016-12-31 00:03:07	@Espyo	aesome
2016-12-31 00:03:09	@Espyo	*awesome
2016-12-31 00:03:12	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-31 00:06:50	@Espyo	going to bed now

2016-12-31 14:10:07	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-31 15:52:36	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Carrying_Louie_during_a_cutscene "This makes the King of Bugs the only treasure that can be carried during a cutscene." I don't know if I've already pointed this out here, but that sentence is wrong
2016-12-31 15:52:53	@Espyo	I think you did, heh
2016-12-31 15:52:55	@Espyo	please remove it
2016-12-31 15:52:59	Marty2000	Normally, Pikmin can't carry treasures during cutscenes (if they're inactive near a treasure, they won't try to carry it)
2016-12-31 15:53:00	@Espyo	I thought it already as removed, though...
2016-12-31 15:53:21	Marty2000	but if you throw Pikmin directly onto the treasure, it'll force them to carry the treasure
2016-12-31 15:53:25	Marty2000	Yeah, I'll remove it
2016-12-31 15:53:31	Marty2000	even during the cutscene...
2016-12-31 15:53:51	Marty2000	I mean, you throw the Pikmin, trigger the cutscene before they land, and you'll see them carrying the treasure during the cutscene :P
2016-12-31 15:55:21	@Espyo	ah, right
2016-12-31 15:57:16	Marty2000	An easy way to check if this works is to throw some Purple Pikmin on the Geographic Projection: that will both trigger the cutscene and make them dig the treasure out (while normally, if they are close to the treasure, they wouldn't dig it out before the cutscene ends)
2016-12-31 15:57:50	@Espyo	yeah, that sounds familiar now that you mention it
2016-12-31 15:57:57	Marty2000	By the way, it's odd, if the Pikmin have dug out the treasure before the cutscene ends, they will not try to carry it, they will come back to you instead
2016-12-31 15:58:07	Marty2000	while they wouldn't do that if there was no cutscene
2016-12-31 15:58:11	Marty2000	I see
2016-12-31 16:01:19	@Espyo	oh, yeah, that is weird
2016-12-31 16:02:54	Marty2000	It's similar to how a "non-discovered Pikmin" behaves (those you get control of with glitches while you haven't unlocked them)
2016-12-31 16:03:26	@Espyo	mhm
2016-12-31 16:28:00	Marty2000	Oh, heh, I just noticed that Pellet Posies having color-changing pellets are also affected by the off-camera thing. Makes sense, but that's weird, heh
2016-12-31 16:31:00	@Espyo	what, they don't cycle if they're off-camera?
2016-12-31 16:34:31	Marty2000	Yes
2016-12-31 16:34:44	Marty2000	At least in P2
2016-12-31 16:34:49	Marty2000	I didn't check for the other games
2016-12-31 16:41:50	@Espyo	right
2016-12-31 16:41:56	@Espyo	P3 is likely not like that
2016-12-31 16:42:17	@Espyo	because of http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pellet#Other_colors
2016-12-31 16:42:28	@Espyo	since they're always in synch regardless of where in the area they are
2016-12-31 16:42:34	@Espyo	they likely cycle based on a global timer
2016-12-31 16:42:41	@Espyo	and not based on them being "active" and counting down the timer by themselves

2016-12-31 16:43:35	Marty2000	Oh, okay
2016-12-31 16:46:46	Marty2000	They also don't cycle while off-camera in P1
2016-12-31 16:50:53	Marty2000	Espyo: ... sorry, it's also the same in P3 :P
2016-12-31 16:51:01	Marty2000	unless you check them with the KopPad
2016-12-31 16:51:06	Marty2000	but otherwise, it's the same behaviour
2016-12-31 16:51:36	@Espyo	hmm
2016-12-31 16:51:38	@Espyo	well, I guess it makes sense
2016-12-31 16:51:43	@Espyo	if it's exclusively with the KopPad
2016-12-31 16:52:10	@Espyo	you can add on the camera article how no color-changing Pellet Posies change colors off-camera, in all games
2016-12-31 16:52:18	@Espyo	not as trivia; I'm sure it fits somewhere in the body of the article
2016-12-31 16:53:03	Marty2000	Wait
2016-12-31 16:53:17	Marty2000	It also happens with the KopPad if they're off-camera and there's no leader nearby
2016-12-31 16:53:20	Marty2000	So...

2016-12-31 17:18:22	@Espyo	maybe to avoid having a massive list, you can probably just put them on the "minor" section instead and give a brief description
2016-12-31 17:18:33	@Espyo	since I doubt they need all of the fancy explanations when they're actually pretty simple

2016-12-31 17:45:04	@Espyo	PNGCrush is the classic one
2016-12-31 17:45:20	@Espyo	PNGCrush with the --brute parameter makes it take like a full minute to crush
2016-12-31 17:45:23	@Espyo	but it's pretty powerful
2016-12-31 17:45:28	@Espyo	maybe there's more powerful and faster out there? iunno
2016-12-31 17:45:39	UltraMario	is it good for big pngs tho
2016-12-31 17:45:40	@Espyo	but I think pretty much all tools nowadays just call PNGCrush in the backend anyway
2016-12-31 17:45:47	@Espyo	I don't think it is, no

2016-12-31 22:12:15	@Espyo	Marty2000: do you have a video of the invisible leader glitch?
2016-12-31 22:12:27	@Espyo	where the leader's last position gets hurt by a Wollywog?

2016-12-31 22:41:22	Marty2000	Sorry Espyo, I was away. I have no video on my channel about this glitch (this one? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Invisible_leader), though I think I do know a video where the glitch is shown (alongside other glitches)
2016-12-31 22:42:13	@Espyo	that's the one
2016-12-31 22:42:20	@Espyo	Grassdigger found one
2016-12-31 22:42:30	@Espyo	but he hasn't replied yet
2016-12-31 22:42:47	Marty2000	Oh
2016-12-31 22:43:01	Marty2000	Wait a few seconds, please
2016-12-31 22:43:59	Marty2000	Espyo: https://youtu.be/ga_6QmokF6I
2016-12-31 22:44:24	Marty2000	the first glitch shown here is the one we're talking about
2016-12-31 22:44:35	Marty2000	however, the video contains several other things as well
2016-12-31 22:44:46	Marty2000	if you need a video with that glitch only, I can make it
2016-12-31 22:44:59	Marty2000	if that video is okay though, then good :)

2016-12-31 22:50:10	Marty2000	... welp, it'll be 2017 for me by the time I've watched it lol
2016-12-31 22:50:13	Marty2000	I see
2016-12-31 22:50:33	Marty2000	It's probably better if the video you wanna put on the wiki contains only that specific glitch
2016-12-31 22:50:40	Marty2000	instead of a lot of other glitches
2016-12-31 22:53:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-31 22:53:13	@Espyo	but we can use that old one

2016-12-31 22:57:22	Marty2000	Yeah, that's what I was trying to say :P
2016-12-31 22:57:30	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-12-31 22:57:32	Marty2000	I mean, that video contains only that glitch, so it's fine

2017-01-01 15:50:57	@Espyo	iunno
2017-01-01 15:51:02	@Espyo	I just think it needs images :P
2017-01-01 15:51:08	@Espyo	but yeah, those sound about right
2017-01-01 15:51:20	@Espyo	maybe the fire trail left behind by slooches?
2017-01-01 15:51:25	@Espyo	I guess that's like... "pure" fire

2017-01-02 19:13:34	Yoshi2	aww, ok

2017-01-02 19:45:11	Yoshi2	hi Espyo 
2017-01-02 19:46:27	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-02 19:48:51	Yoshi2	Espyo: https://soundcloud.com/debugyoshi/pikmin-ai-no-uta-pikmin-2-soundfont-test
2017-01-02 19:55:12	@Espyo	you just had to pick the one Pikmin song that's not in a game
2017-01-02 19:55:22	@Espyo	also it sounds like a nightmare
2017-01-02 19:55:55	Yoshi2	that's why I created that image for it
2017-01-02 19:56:17	Yoshi2	if I map the instruments to more fitting ones, it actually sounds quite decent
2017-01-02 19:56:34	@Espyo	well, good
2017-01-02 19:56:49	Yoshi2	but I'm still missing instruments that would go with this song
2017-01-02 19:57:17	Yoshi2	and as scruffy mentioned, wwdumpsnd doesn't dump all instruments properly
2017-01-02 19:58:17	Yoshi2	sooo be amazed: https://github.com/RenolY2/pikmindumpsnd
2017-01-02 19:58:25	Yoshi2	i effectively forked it
2017-01-02 19:58:50	Yoshi2	haven't done work yet though
2017-01-02 19:59:10	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-02 20:04:28	Marty2000	Hi Espyo
2017-01-02 20:04:47	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-02 20:05:11	Yoshi2	I would pick songs that are actually in the game but I need midis for that first
2017-01-02 20:07:29	Yoshi2	nobody writes down format docs anymore, so you gotta reverse-engineer it from code
2017-01-02 20:07:30	Yoshi2	yay
2017-01-02 20:07:34	@Espyo	yep
2017-01-02 21:36:58	Yoshi2	https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule oooh i see claris on the list doing MP2

2017-01-02 22:46:15	@Espyo	this got me thinking
2017-01-02 22:46:38	@Espyo	I could probably write a Python script that reads a file, organizes stuff in classes, and then just dumps it on a GUI
2017-01-02 22:46:44	@Espyo	using libraries and the like
2017-01-02 22:46:53	@Espyo	can you recommend anything?
2017-01-02 22:51:00	Yoshi2	Espyo: recommend what, libraries?
2017-01-02 22:51:10	@Espyo	libraries, ways to approach the problem, etc.
2017-01-02 22:51:21	@Espyo	like, if you wanted to do it, what would you do?
2017-01-02 22:54:22	Yoshi2	for reading files you probably need to roll your own lib on the basis of regular file reading because the files are in a weird format
2017-01-02 22:55:17	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-02 23:00:21	Yoshi2	in terms of gui i've only worked with qt so far (ages ago also with tkinter but I don't touch that anymore)
2017-01-02 23:00:53	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-02 23:00:58	Yoshi2	tk comes with python so users wouldn't have to install a library
2017-01-02 23:01:08	@Espyo	I'm staring to think it's about time somebody developed a simple framework for this
2017-01-02 23:01:31	@Espyo	you feed it some binary data, you tell it what it maps to, and it shows a GUI with textboxes and checkboxes for each field
2017-01-02 23:02:52	Yoshi2	with qt I've done this http://i.imgur.com/FYXMpdS.png and I also did this: https://i.imgur.com/vtmxc8W.png (hackjob based on the gui from the first screenshot)
2017-01-02 23:03:16	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2017-01-02 23:12:27	Yoshi2	if you have any more specifc questions, i'm right heeeeere

2017-01-03 18:50:34	@J	yeah, pretty good just seeing all the family
2017-01-03 18:50:48	@J	since I only get to 2-3 times a year
2017-01-03 18:51:05	@J	Espyo: I don't think you can automate the file parsing - every type will need special code - but a GUI, sure
2017-01-03 18:51:19	@J	I found http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/ and http://www.thomasfrank.se/downloadableJS/JSONeditor_example.html
2017-01-03 18:51:49	@J	but for custom display like graphics showing maps and stuff it will probably need custom code
2017-01-03 18:52:13	@J	also if you're talking about doing it yourself, I've used GTK and Qt
2017-01-03 18:52:23	@J	probably GTK is a bit easier to start with and feels nicer in Python
2017-01-03 18:52:43	@Espyo	oh, those JSON GUI generators look great
2017-01-03 18:52:48	@Espyo	it's more or less what I had in mind
2017-01-03 18:52:58	@Espyo	all right, sounds good then
2017-01-03 18:52:59	@Espyo	thanks
2017-01-03 18:53:04	@J	but Qt is overall better, more featureful, less weird edge cases, but feels more like you're writing C++ or something
2017-01-03 18:53:15	@J	which might actually make you feel at home
2017-01-03 18:53:18	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-03 18:53:26	@Espyo	heavily object-oriented, huh?
2017-01-03 18:53:33	@J	yeah, very much
2017-01-03 18:53:42	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-03 18:54:05	@J	it also has a markup language for writing quick UIs called QML
2017-01-03 18:54:20	@J	and it can integrate with custom graphics more easily I think, 3D accelerated stuff
2017-01-03 18:54:26	Yoshi2	i never got into that markup language
2017-01-03 18:54:37	@J	yeah, me neither, but it's worth mentioning
2017-01-03 18:54:46	@Espyo	oh
2017-01-03 18:54:47	@J	FWIW GTK has one too, kind of
2017-01-03 18:54:53	@Espyo	I think I might've heard of it before
2017-01-03 18:55:11	@J	it has Vala, which is a Python-like language for making GUIs, and I think it also has a markup language and IDE for using it, like Qt Creator
2017-01-03 18:56:06	@J	yeah, Glade/GTKBuilder
2017-01-03 18:56:33	@Espyo	yikes
2017-01-03 18:56:46	@Espyo	it's amazing how some standards are actually standard
2017-01-03 18:56:48	@Espyo	like HTML
2017-01-03 18:56:53	@Espyo	and others are... just another
2017-01-03 18:56:57	@Espyo	quick, where's that xkcd comic?
2017-01-03 18:57:07	@Espyo	https://xkcd.com/927/
2017-01-03 18:58:03	@J	you can never have too many web browsers or text editors
2017-01-03 19:12:01	@Espyo	ok, quick update
2017-01-03 19:12:23	@Espyo	my laptop came back from warranty yesterday, but when I booted it, instead of being shown GRUB, with windows and Lubuntu for dual-booting
2017-01-03 19:12:28	@Espyo	it just sent me to the windows setup
2017-01-03 19:12:33	@Espyo	meaning they wiped out my hard drive
2017-01-03 19:12:44	@Espyo	thing is, I booted a Live CD running Lubuntu
2017-01-03 19:12:48	@Espyo	checked the disk
2017-01-03 19:13:02	@Espyo	and there's a large partition that's of the "Linux filesystem" type
2017-01-03 19:13:10	@Espyo	...like 95% sure that's my stuff
2017-01-03 19:13:21	@Espyo	I can't mount it because it's a Live CD
2017-01-03 19:13:29	@Espyo	but I'm a bit hesitant about what to do next
2017-01-03 19:13:38	@Espyo	I'll try to repair GRUB
2017-01-03 19:13:44	@Espyo	hopefully it'll find that there's still an OS there
2017-01-03 19:17:33	@J	yeah, I believe Ubuntu Grub will check all the partitions for OSs
2017-01-03 19:17:43	@J	and magically do the thing
2017-01-03 19:17:47	@Espyo	hope so
2017-01-03 19:18:03	@J	what did you send it in for?
2017-01-03 19:18:14	@Espyo	what I'm most worried about is managing to get GRUB going, go back to setup windows, and it just wipes my stuff again
2017-01-03 19:18:18	@Espyo	the backlight stopped working
2017-01-03 19:18:22	@Espyo	I talked to my boss about this
2017-01-03 19:18:29	@Espyo	he also bought the same laptop like a week apart
2017-01-03 19:18:32	@Espyo	his backlight broke too
2017-01-03 19:18:41	@J	I don't think Windows should do anything except on install
2017-01-03 19:18:42	@Espyo	he didn't think much of it because he thought he messed something up when he was doing his usual shenanigans
2017-01-03 19:18:52	@Espyo	yyyyyyep, that's the keyword, "SHOULD"
2017-01-03 19:18:53	@J	maybe they ran a Windows boot repair disk or something for some reason
2017-01-03 19:19:00	@J	some crazy standard procedure they have
2017-01-03 19:19:04	@Espyo	I've seen enough horror stories to have to drink milk to sleep at night
2017-01-03 19:19:09	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-03 19:19:24	@J	honestly I would've just removed the drive before sending it in, if the warranty allows
2017-01-03 19:20:18	@Espyo	I was too dumb to realize
2017-01-03 19:20:22	@Espyo	obvious in hindsight, sure...
2017-01-03 19:20:37	@Espyo	though yeah, they could always reject it because I didn't send the hard drive in
2017-01-03 19:22:51	@J	at least image it onto a spare drive
2017-01-03 19:23:13	@J	with dd you can actually put part-images on multiple drives
2017-01-03 19:23:18	@Espyo	yeah, I got none :(
2017-01-03 19:23:36	@Espyo	my boss recommended me a great one, but I can't really get it yet
2017-01-03 19:23:41	@Espyo	I'll see how this goes
2017-01-03 19:23:48	@Espyo	if GRUB can fix it all, great
2017-01-03 19:23:55	@J	always worth picking up some spare cheap drives for long-term storage or emergency use
2017-01-03 19:23:56	@Espyo	if not, I'll try to invest on making a backup first
2017-01-03 19:24:03	@Espyo	yeah... starting to learn that now
2017-01-03 19:24:10	@Espyo	I wouldn't lose EVERYTHING either way, though
2017-01-03 19:24:17	@Espyo	important stuff is always synched with dropbox
2017-01-03 19:24:27	@Espyo	and I did backup some things before sending it over
2017-01-03 19:24:28	@J	I guess you say it looks like the data's still there anyway
2017-01-03 19:24:29	@Espyo	but yeesh
2017-01-03 19:24:36	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-03 19:24:36	@J	you could probably mount that partition on a live CD
2017-01-03 19:24:45	@Espyo	I tried, but it said there wasn't enough space
2017-01-03 19:25:04	@Espyo	I'll uh...try to re-create the live CD, giving it more user-file space this time
2017-01-03 19:25:20	@Espyo	I tried to install the boot-repair package and I couldn't even do THAT
2017-01-03 19:26:45	@J	enough space to mount it?
2017-01-03 19:26:49	@J	it shouldn't need any space
2017-01-03 19:27:21	@J	and it should be using RAM anyway, of which I'm sure you have a few GB spare
2017-01-03 19:27:35	@Espyo	ok, good, it's not just me then
2017-01-03 19:27:37	@Espyo	I found it weird too
2017-01-03 19:27:53	@Espyo	still, can't go wrong with giving the USB stick some more space
2017-01-03 19:28:39	@Espyo	ok, take two
2017-01-03 19:30:09	@Espyo	oh, it worked this time
2017-01-03 19:30:35	@Espyo	WOO!
2017-01-03 19:30:37	@Espyo	my stuff's all here!
2017-01-03 19:39:58	@J	nice
2017-01-03 19:40:37	@Espyo	ok, my boss recommended me a WD Elements 2TB USB3.0 external hard drive
2017-01-03 19:40:48	@Espyo	and I might be able to buy it now
2017-01-03 19:40:52	@Espyo	store's only 5 minute walk away
2017-01-03 19:41:04	@Espyo	 100€, I guess that's like £0

2017-01-03 19:50:19	@Espyo	except when foreigners are abroad
2017-01-03 19:54:42	Yoshi2	Espyo: on a more positive note i finished my tank https://i.imgur.com/wE3O83n.jpg
2017-01-03 19:55:06	Yoshi2	the main turret can be taken off and it's quite roomy inside, so I can hide stuff in it

2017-01-03 19:55:53	@Espyo	and I love bonuses like that

2017-01-03 20:49:39	@Espyo	I JUST SAW AN OTTER
2017-01-03 20:49:46	@Espyo	we have this tiny river nearby
2017-01-03 20:49:50	@Espyo	it's barely anything
2017-01-03 20:49:54	@Espyo	it's like 2 meters wide, at most
2017-01-03 20:49:58	@Espyo	 1 meter deep, if that
2017-01-03 20:50:03	@Espyo	AND THERE WAS AN OTTER SWIMMING IN IT
2017-01-03 20:50:40	Yoshi2	oooooooooooooooooh
2017-01-03 20:51:16	@Espyo	I wasn't sure if this was actually normal over here or if it's like a late Christmas miracle
2017-01-03 20:51:18	@Espyo	told the family
2017-01-03 20:51:22	@Espyo	definitely not normal
2017-01-03 20:51:35	@Espyo	it probably came from upstream, where the river is a real river, much farther up
2017-01-03 20:51:46	@Espyo	but down here it's no more than a small stream
2017-01-03 20:52:12	@Espyo	"Pikipedia Reacts" will probably put us all in jail
2017-01-03 20:55:54	UltraMario	kek
2017-01-03 20:59:28	@Espyo	okay, time to clone the hard drive
2017-01-03 21:02:31	@Espyo	J: ok, so, something like /dev/sda refers to the hard drive
2017-01-03 21:02:40	@Espyo	whereas /dev/sda1 refers to the first partition within that hard drive
2017-01-03 21:02:42	@Espyo	is this right?
2017-01-03 21:30:19	@J	yeah
2017-01-03 21:30:26	@J	well 1 isn't necessarily the 1st
2017-01-03 21:30:29	@J	but it's a partition, yeah
2017-01-03 21:34:00	Yoshi2	I need a guide to /dev/
2017-01-03 21:34:24	Yoshi2	every time I use linux and I see /dev/sdaXYZ I become very afraid of touching anything

2017-01-03 21:38:42	Neocraftz1553	Hello, chat.
2017-01-03 21:48:28	Yoshi2	hi Neocraftz1553 
2017-01-03 21:48:52	Yoshi2	how is your game coming along?
2017-01-03 21:57:58	Neocraftz1553	The space one?
2017-01-03 21:58:29	Neocraftz1553	Nicely.
2017-01-03 21:58:44	Neocraftz1553	I've added in quite a few weapons, plus some menus.
2017-01-03 22:03:09	@Espyo	clonezilla isn't liking me
2017-01-03 22:03:15	@Espyo	I can't create a clone of the disk
2017-01-03 22:03:20	@Espyo	complains that the disk is mounted, even when it isn't
2017-01-03 22:03:29	@Espyo	I can try cloning a partition instead..
2017-01-03 22:03:31	@Espyo	*.
2017-01-03 22:04:52	Neocraftz1553	Woah
2017-01-03 22:04:59	Neocraftz1553	Just downloaded the PFE 0.9
2017-01-03 22:06:22	@Espyo	oh, what do you think?
2017-01-03 22:07:30	Neocraftz1553	It's awesome
2017-01-03 22:07:39	Neocraftz1553	The new graphics fit it pretty well.
2017-01-03 22:09:17	@Espyo	thanks
2017-01-03 22:09:21	@Espyo	I wasn't sure if they would
2017-01-03 22:11:05	Neocraftz1553	The light_grass, the dark_grass, and the starting screen graphics are the best ones in it, in my opinion.
2017-01-03 22:11:21	Neocraftz1553	Overall, it's a very good update.
2017-01-03 22:11:39	Neocraftz1553	Oh, by the by...
2017-01-03 22:12:01	Neocraftz1553	It's says "Alpha 0.8 for Windows" in the 0.9 description.
2017-01-03 22:14:56	@Espyo	...oops
2017-01-03 22:15:32	@Espyo	can't believe I let that slide
2017-01-03 22:15:33	@Espyo	thanks
2017-01-03 22:15:36	@Espyo	fixed now
2017-01-03 22:15:41	@Espyo	what do you think about the sounds, though...?
2017-01-03 22:18:35	Neocraftz1553	The sound is ok, but that's because I'm used to the normal pikmin sounds.
2017-01-03 22:19:06	Neocraftz1553	But it's a great idea to add in Free licensed sounds.
2017-01-03 22:19:14	@Espyo	thanks
2017-01-03 22:19:20	@Espyo	I'll still try to improve them as time goes by
2017-01-03 22:19:26	@Espyo	but they're a LOT harder than I thought they would
2017-01-03 22:19:29	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok.
2017-01-03 22:19:51	Neocraftz1553	Yes, sound is really tough to come up with. Especially from scratch
2017-01-03 22:20:38	@Espyo	even with Scruffy guiding me it was a nightmare!...
2017-01-03 22:20:51	Neocraftz1553	Heh.
2017-01-03 22:21:12	Neocraftz1553	Did you try his "tutorial"?
2017-01-03 22:21:23	Neocraftz1553	On his Pikmin sounds video.
2017-01-03 22:21:43	@Espyo	mhm
2017-01-03 22:21:52	@Espyo	as well as some more updated notes he told me
2017-01-03 22:21:55	@Espyo	even still it's a nightmare
2017-01-03 22:22:03	@Espyo	if your voice's timbre doesn't match that of Totaka's, you're pretty much boned
2017-01-03 22:22:30	Neocraftz1553	Hah, imagine how many times Nintendo had to test and tweak the sounds :p
2017-01-03 22:23:40	@Espyo	poor devs...
2017-01-03 22:25:24	Neocraftz1553	Gotta respect those sound designers

2017-01-06 18:45:44	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-01-06 18:45:45	Testyo	Like they go
2017-01-06 18:53:48	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-06 18:55:28	Marty2000	Hi Espyo
2017-01-06 18:55:33	Marty2000	and Testyo's back!
2017-01-06 18:55:33	Testyo	Or at least where I get that he's trying to help, but having to explain what water is before he tells me how to bake a cake is kinda stupid
2017-01-06 18:55:46	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-06 18:55:47	@Espyo	yep
2017-01-06 18:55:51	@Espyo	everything's back to normal, now
2017-01-06 20:28:51	Yoshi2	Espyo: is there any sort of government support for adults (say mid 20s) facing family abuse in portugal?
2017-01-06 20:28:57	Yoshi2	asking for a friend
2017-01-06 20:29:31	@Espyo	...hello to you too
2017-01-06 20:29:44	@Espyo	not... specifically, I don't think
2017-01-06 20:29:48	@Espyo	you're getting me worried, though
2017-01-06 20:30:16	Yoshi2	i did say hi earlier so it's faaaiiir game right
2017-01-06 20:30:22	@Espyo	well yeah but
2017-01-06 20:30:36	@Espyo	don't just go from "howdy do" to "help me save this guy from a murder"
2017-01-06 20:31:11	Yoshi2	don't worry there is no immediate danger
2017-01-06 20:32:13	@Espyo	how in the world did you score a SECOND friend in Portugal?
2017-01-06 20:32:22	@Espyo	there's only like... 7 Portuguese people in all, really
2017-01-06 20:32:56	Yoshi2	oh i've known him for a while now, probably just never talked about him before :P
2017-01-06 20:33:05	@Espyo	welp
2017-01-06 20:34:15	Marty2000	:/
2017-01-06 20:41:50	Yoshi2	getting a job and moving out is probably one way of dealing with it but that's obviously not done very quickly
2017-01-06 20:42:36	Yoshi2	actually i think i once asked "is it feasible to get a job in less than a month" or something like that here once before
2017-01-06 20:43:06	@Espyo	don't remember you asking, I don't think
2017-01-06 20:43:16	@Espyo	for a job like mine, as a programmer, within a month is fairly easy
2017-01-06 20:43:20	@Espyo	otherwise no, very much no
2017-01-06 20:43:55	Yoshi2	let me dig out the logs i swear i asked it once before
2017-01-06 20:46:52	Yoshi2	maybe it was not a month but a week or so
2017-01-06 20:47:06	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-06 20:47:29	Yoshi2	Oct 03 18:15:56 <Yoshi2>	Espyo: how feasible would it be to find a job in portugal in around a month?
2017-01-06 20:47:29	Yoshi2	Oct 03 18:16:09 <Espyo>	lolno
2017-01-06 20:47:29	Yoshi2	Oct 03 18:16:16 <Espyo>	wait, depends on the area
2017-01-06 20:47:29	Yoshi2	Oct 03 18:16:23 <Espyo>	as a computer engineer, actually feasible
2017-01-06 20:47:30	Yoshi2	Oct 03 18:16:30 <Espyo>	otherwise, over a year to find any job
2017-01-06 20:47:39	Yoshi2	ok it was a month
2017-01-06 20:48:07	Yoshi2	october 2015
2017-01-06 20:48:15	@Espyo	haha
2017-01-06 20:48:26	@Espyo	I just mirrored myself right now then
2017-01-06 20:48:37	@Espyo	but...yeah, I guess you did
2017-01-06 20:49:18	Yoshi2	... i am quite suprised I managed to remember something from a year ago
2017-01-06 20:49:38	Yoshi2	what is up with my selective memory
2017-01-06 20:49:48	@Espyo	my daily struggle
2017-01-06 20:49:52	Yoshi2	sure would've helped if i could remember the answers to the exam questions
2017-01-06 20:50:03	@Espyo	"hey, I found out you can just disable this parameter to fix this glitch"
2017-01-06 20:50:10	@Espyo	"ah, all right, that makes sense. thanks for letting me know"
2017-01-06 20:50:15	@Espyo	*2 minutes later*
2017-01-06 20:50:25	@Espyo	"hey, remember that parameter? it won't work because of the resolution, and the glitch will return"

2017-01-08 20:58:35	Yoshi2	today i finally finished it yay, adgq delayed its completion a bit
2017-01-08 20:58:48	Yoshi2	at 18 minutes it is longer than my previous video
2017-01-08 20:59:31	Yoshi2	i might have talked a bit slowly at some parts but that comes from me trying to come up with stuff to say or do on the fly
2017-01-08 21:01:37	@Espyo	yikes, 18 minutes
2017-01-08 21:02:09	@Espyo	I heard it's better to talk slowly or give meaningful pauses than to go "uuuhhmm" or "eerrr..." to stop while you're thinking of what to say
2017-01-08 21:38:16	Testyo	it doesn't sound like on Discord
2017-01-08 21:40:20	Yoshi2	when I have more of a script to follow next time maybe I will be quicker too

2017-01-09 19:01:53	Yoshi2	the way this program deals with .aw files
2017-01-09 19:02:54	@Espyo	right
2017-01-09 19:03:02	@Espyo	I read a tiny bit on Discord
2017-01-09 19:03:07	@Espyo	good work so far
2017-01-09 19:31:09	Yoshi2	for the most part the format is compatible with pikmin, but now comes the part about .aw and i am actually puzzled
2017-01-09 19:33:52	@Espyo	I bet

2017-01-09 19:50:23	@Espyo	I got an invincible Blue Pikmin somehow
2017-01-09 19:50:29	@Espyo	I'm trying to do extinction research
2017-01-09 19:50:35	@Espyo	so I let my Blues burn up with a nearby Blowhog
2017-01-09 19:50:43	@Espyo	...one of them joined my side, and I couldn't control it
2017-01-09 19:50:48	@Espyo	and it was also invincible
2017-01-09 19:50:55	@Espyo	also, TIL that in Pikmin 3, if you bump against a burning Pikmin, you save it
2017-01-09 19:51:07	Marty2000	Yoshi2: hmmm... how would you explain that? :P
2017-01-09 19:51:12	@Espyo	I might've bumped against one the exact moment it was going to burn up and die
2017-01-09 19:51:18	Marty2000	Espyo: Oh, nice
2017-01-09 19:51:25	@Espyo	or maybe I was touching it when it caught fire and the game both set it ablaze AND saved it?

2017-01-09 20:24:20	Yoshi2	this format is
2017-01-09 20:24:24	Yoshi2	absolutely
2017-01-09 20:24:25	Yoshi2	insane
2017-01-09 20:25:07	Yoshi2	so you start reading aaf and you need a specific chunk with the id 3 and you seek to it
2017-01-09 20:25:29	Yoshi2	you get to a WSYS and you read a bit of data and there is another offset and you seek to that offset
2017-01-09 20:26:12	Yoshi2	you get to a WINF and you read some data which is a table of offsets which can actually be before the WINF so you seek back again
2017-01-09 20:27:00	Yoshi2	you get to a string with the name of the .aw file and you read it plus some more data and there is a table of sound entries which will send you to an even earlier spot
2017-01-09 20:27:20	Yoshi2	which finally has some relevant data on the sound which you use to seek in a different file
2017-01-09 20:29:03	@Espyo	._.
2017-01-09 20:33:46	Yoshi2	need to update a part in my documentation
2017-01-09 20:58:18	@Espyo	Marty2000: on my loose notes, you said you had tried having 99 Yellows on the overworld, plus 1 Red, and transforming that Red (the last one of its kind) into a Yellow
2017-01-09 20:58:20	@Espyo	in Pikmin 3
2017-01-09 20:58:26	@Espyo	but your comment makes no sense
2017-01-09 20:58:44	@Espyo	<Marty2000> Espyo: "Outside, 99 Yellows + 1 Red in the area, swap your last Red for a Yellow." In P1, if you land in the same area, the red will appear in the Onion
2017-01-09 20:58:44	@Espyo	<Marty2000> Same in P3 (tested yesterday)
2017-01-09 20:58:54	@Espyo	what do you mean "same in P3"?
2017-01-09 20:59:01	@Espyo	P3 has instant effects when a Pikmin becomes extinct
2017-01-09 20:59:10	@Espyo	there's not really any "if you land in the same area" stuff
2017-01-09 21:17:10	Marty2000	"The red will appear in the Onion" = same
2017-01-09 21:17:16	Marty2000	not the land in the same area stuff ;)

2017-01-10 18:44:27	Testyo	what did you yes
2017-01-10 18:44:40	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-10 18:52:27	Yoshi2	the current dark messiah run is using lots of glitches but i have being excited
2017-01-10 18:52:51	Yoshi2	*have trouble
2017-01-10 18:55:10	@Espyo	oh heh
2017-01-10 18:55:17	@Espyo	dunno, looks like AGDQ this year is a bit weak
2017-01-10 18:55:19	@Espyo	from what I'm hearing
2017-01-10 19:00:49	Yoshi2	I had a blast with a few of the games
2017-01-10 19:01:01	Yoshi2	OoT 3D was great with the new tricks the runner used
2017-01-10 19:06:57	@Espyo	ooh, new tricks
2017-01-10 19:08:33	Yoshi2	aaaaaah i missed miles'/claris' mp2 run
2017-01-10 19:10:55	@Espyo	drat
2017-01-10 19:12:11	Yoshi2	though for the most part I was interested in how she'd handle being miles at agdq
2017-01-10 19:13:50	@Espyo	should be fairly straight forward
2017-01-10 19:13:54	@Espyo	but the keyword is "should"...
2017-01-10 19:15:23	Yoshi2	mhm, simplest would be to just be miles
2017-01-10 19:19:27	Yoshi2	rip twitter https://twitter.com/milessmb?lang=en
2017-01-10 19:20:42	Yoshi2	i also wanted to see super metroid rotation but when i was home again it just ended :(
2017-01-10 19:21:56	Yoshi2	oh i think this is her actual twitter https://twitter.com/ClarisRobyn
2017-01-10 19:22:41	Yoshi2	"I'm unable to make it for my Echoes run today :( Fortunately some "Miles" guy is available instead, hopefully he isn't too terrible" heh
2017-01-10 19:22:51	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-10 19:33:53	Yoshi2	https://twitter.com/ClarisRobyn/status/817873066357391360 neato
2017-01-10 19:36:27	@Espyo	well she's having fun with this whole thing
2017-01-10 19:37:29	Yoshi2	quite so, the tweets are a gold mine in terms of humor
2017-01-10 19:39:10	Yoshi2	this guy is being nice but i also don't quite understand him https://www.reddit.com/r/battalionwarsmod/comments/5ld74q/battalion_wars_2_wii_cheats_europe/
2017-01-10 19:39:36	Yoshi2	like in the middle of the comment chain he wishes me luck and i am super confused
2017-01-10 19:44:18	@Espyo	didn't you say you'd port the code for him?
2017-01-10 19:57:53	Yoshi2	Espyo: I realized the US invincibility code is compatible with the EU version so I told him to use the US code
2017-01-10 19:58:05	@Espyo	oh
2017-01-10 19:58:09	@Espyo	I must've missed that part
2017-01-10 19:58:18	@Espyo	guess he did too :P
2017-01-10 19:58:27	Yoshi2	yup
2017-01-10 20:01:28	Yoshi2	such a shame because I was getting into it
2017-01-10 20:02:15	@Espyo	eh you'll find more
2017-01-10 20:02:32	Yoshi2	the US code replaces an instruction somewhere at the start of the code with a jump to BumfuckNowhere, and it writes some code to BumfuckNowhere that sets some registers to specific values
2017-01-10 20:03:50	@Espyo	...BumfuckNowhere
2017-01-10 20:03:50	Yoshi2	and the place where it writes the jump is identical between the EU and US version so I assumed the piece of code it writes will work in the EU version too
2017-01-10 20:04:57	Yoshi2	would you prefer 0x817C3E00?
2017-01-10 20:07:58	@Espyo	ggggguess not
2017-01-10 20:08:28	Yoshi2	i named it like that because it's at the far end of the code map when I dumped it with dolphin
2017-01-10 20:09:02	@Espyo	heh, fair
2017-01-10 20:09:28	Yoshi2	in fact it isn't even in the code map, it's just outside of the biggest address in my code map
2017-01-10 20:09:54	Yoshi2	I did find it using dolphin's debug mode
2017-01-10 20:11:06	Yoshi2	the code dumping is rather weird sometimes, when I tried it on the EU version it stopped at a third of the way
2017-01-10 20:12:04	@Espyo	oh, huh
2017-01-10 20:12:12	@Espyo	you're having fun with dumps that don't finish right, lately
2017-01-10 20:12:49	Yoshi2	I actually thing that some of the issues I had with my pikmin soundfont might be related to viena
2017-01-10 20:12:55	Yoshi2	*think
2017-01-10 20:13:44	Yoshi2	the sounds that aren't garbled sound fine in any music player
2017-01-10 20:14:35	Yoshi2	some sounds are garbage though and they are related to that value 3 which the dumping program doesn't handle
2017-01-10 20:16:42	Yoshi2	the thing about part of sounds being in the previous sound, I didn't hear that when I listened to the files directly
2017-01-10 20:16:49	Yoshi2	so I guess viena screwed up
2017-01-10 20:17:46	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-10 20:19:06	Yoshi2	viena already screwed up the filenames of the samples when I saved the soundfont so I wouldn't be suprised if it screwed up that too
2017-01-10 20:21:53	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-10 21:26:45	Yoshi2	these daikatana loading screens
2017-01-10 21:48:03	@Espyo	hm? what about?
2017-01-10 21:52:05	Yoshi2	for some reason the runner had really long loading screens and he had to restart the game to fix that
2017-01-10 21:54:52	@Espyo	lolwut
2017-01-10 22:06:08	@J	I never realised Claris is a female name
2017-01-10 22:06:15	@J	sounds quite masculine to me
2017-01-10 22:06:57	@Espyo	sounds kinda ambiguous to me
2017-01-10 22:07:02	@Espyo	like Morgan
2017-01-10 22:07:22	@Espyo	oh, hah!
2017-01-10 22:07:36	@Espyo	I can't remember if I noticed before, but she likely picked that name because of NiGHTS
2017-01-10 22:08:03	@J	never played it, but I think I watched a video once?
2017-01-10 22:08:42	@J	is that the name of a character or something?
2017-01-10 22:08:45	@Espyo	mhm
2017-01-10 22:08:48	@Espyo	you can pick the girl or the boy
2017-01-10 22:08:50	@Espyo	the girl is Claris
2017-01-10 22:08:54	@Espyo	though it doesn't matter
2017-01-10 22:09:01	@Espyo	every level, you play as that character for 3 seconds
2017-01-10 22:09:14	@Espyo	until you touch the Ideya (I think that's the name?) and turn into NiGHTS
2017-01-10 22:09:24	@Espyo	I guess there are two different plots though
2017-01-10 22:14:00	@J	so I got an Android tablet today, my first ever one of these devices with a touch-focused OS
2017-01-10 22:14:25	@J	my goal for today was to install F-Droid, and wow, they kind of don't want you to
2017-01-10 22:15:03	@J	well, ignoring the part that interfaces as a hole feel more like a point-and-click adventure than something designed for use
2017-01-10 22:15:36	@J	I eventually had to execute the APK by opening a local file in the browser, downloading it FROM A LOCAL FILE TO ANOTHER LOCAL FILE, then launching it
2017-01-10 22:15:45	@J	so sensible
2017-01-10 22:17:10	@Espyo	wow
2017-01-10 22:17:18	@Espyo	yeah, I've heard it's a pain to even root it
2017-01-10 22:17:22	@Espyo	it's so...jarring
2017-01-10 22:20:59	@J	well, I'll have it feeling like a sensible system soon enough
2017-01-10 22:21:13	@Espyo	hopefully
2017-01-10 22:21:45	@J	I also turned the home screen thing from a weird Windows-like desktop, with specific icons and widgets and stuff, into an application search

2017-01-10 22:25:58	@Espyo	do you have a keyboard around?
2017-01-10 22:26:05	@Espyo	otherwise I can only imagine that being even worse
2017-01-10 22:28:40	@J	you only need to type 2-3 characters usually
2017-01-10 22:29:41	@J	I do plan to look into other on-screen keyboards anyway
2017-01-10 22:36:59	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-01-10 22:37:11	@Espyo	hey, Switfkey is pretty highly regarded

2017-01-11 18:15:34	Yoshi2	hi marty
2017-01-11 18:16:46	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2
2017-01-11 18:17:23	Yoshi2	Marty2000: somebody came along in a different channel, showed this picture and asked if that merch is real: http://imgur.com/gallery/kNfyJ
2017-01-11 18:17:35	Yoshi2	it has "made in france" written on it
2017-01-11 18:18:39	Marty2000	Honestly, I've never seen it. Does the person know when that merch was made?
2017-01-11 18:19:55	Yoshi2	they said 1990, the ball says copyright 1991 so I guess that was when it was made
2017-01-11 18:20:29	Yoshi2	and I think right above the made in france is the address of a french toy company
2017-01-11 18:26:41	Marty2000	http://www.societe.com/societe/monneret-industrie-439506346.html it ceased to sell toys in 2008 and closed in 2014. I found it on the Internet
2017-01-11 18:26:53	Marty2000	Though, I can't find the merch
2017-01-11 18:26:57	Marty2000	still, let me try to
2017-01-11 18:27:47	Yoshi2	it ceased to sell toys in 2008 already, that's sad
2017-01-11 18:30:16	Marty2000	I can get a detailed log of all events related to it if I pay 9,90 euros :>
2017-01-11 18:30:44	Marty2000	But... I kinda don't want to pay just to check if they closed because of "unauthorized" merch
2017-01-11 18:31:33	Marty2000	So I'll just research more I guess :P
2017-01-11 18:32:25	Yoshi2	it's for science!!!
2017-01-11 18:32:38	Marty2000	https://www.yelp.fr/biz/monneret-jouets-lons-le-saunier apparently, it did create merch that sold all over the world
2017-01-11 18:34:32	Marty2000	Yoshi2: ... what it sold before closing http://s-www.leprogres.fr/images/7F2E4EB4-F833-490F-B9DC-3E6E54D457B2/LPR_v1_03/jouets-monneret-des-encheres-a-ne-pas-manquer-aujourd-hui-1309715241.jpg
2017-01-11 18:34:57	Marty2000	When I see that photo, I can't imagine it selling Mario products, lol
2017-01-11 18:36:28	Yoshi2	almost 20 years between the ball and them stopping selling toys
2017-01-11 18:36:58	Marty2000	It has also been acquired by Smoby (dunno if it's in Germany too): http://www.smoby.com/fr/accueil/
2017-01-11 18:37:05	Marty2000	Yeah
2017-01-11 18:37:39	Yoshi2	they have a german site http://www.smoby.com/de/home/
2017-01-11 18:38:01	Marty2000	Yoshi2: according to this site, the society was created in 2001 http://www.europages.fr/MONNERET-INDUSTRIE/FRA005584-00101.html
2017-01-11 18:38:04	Marty2000	I see
2017-01-11 18:39:51	Marty2000	So, logically, it must have been made after 2001
2017-01-11 18:40:11	Marty2000	("it" being the merch)
2017-01-11 18:41:27	Marty2000	To me, it seems to be real merch, since it sold all over the world

2017-01-11 20:03:16	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-11 20:12:32	Yoshi2	ok i assume he is confused about how to make a gct out of it

2017-01-11 20:28:27	Yoshi2	phew my guess was right
2017-01-11 20:28:52	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-11 20:29:27	Yoshi2	i guess that is why he had trouble with me saying "just use the us code"
2017-01-11 20:29:36	Yoshi2	he'd have to make a new gct out of it
2017-01-11 20:55:55	Yoshi2	ugh, the stepping feature in Dolphin is so annoying
2017-01-11 20:56:11	Yoshi2	if I do something incorrectly, I seem to step into an interrupt or something and the game breaks
2017-01-11 20:59:16	@Espyo	...huh?
2017-01-11 20:59:17	Yoshi2	actually I don't need to do anything incorrectly
2017-01-11 20:59:19	@Espyo	didn't you say this before?
2017-01-11 20:59:22	@Espyo	I'm feeling deja vu
2017-01-11 20:59:28	Yoshi2	very likely
2017-01-11 20:59:54	@Espyo	up to the point where I was wondering what you meant by "stepping" at first, and then understanding when I read the next messae
2017-01-11 20:59:56	@Espyo	*message
2017-01-11 21:01:08	Yoshi2	oh maybe it has something to do with dualcore
2017-01-11 21:01:23	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2017-01-11 21:01:28	@Espyo	disable it if you don't care about performance
2017-01-11 21:36:01	Yoshi2	i will now try to come up with a cheat to play BW multiplayer levels in singleplayer
2017-01-11 21:38:09	@Espyo	nice
2017-01-11 21:40:37	Yoshi2	the way i am doing this is quite wow
2017-01-11 21:40:55	Yoshi2	I dump the ram at a point i think would be useful, then check for filename strings
2017-01-11 21:41:07	Yoshi2	then I switch out filenames and maybe that will do the trick
2017-01-11 21:42:08	Yoshi2	ok let's see if this works
2017-01-11 21:43:03	Yoshi2	didn't do jack, weird
2017-01-11 21:45:17	Yoshi2	i have a different idea
2017-01-11 21:50:20	@Espyo	pfft
2017-01-11 21:56:47	Yoshi2	i wish you could see how i am doing this cheat code
2017-01-11 21:57:02	Yoshi2	i feel like i'm in the stone age
2017-01-11 22:00:18	@Espyo	I wish so too
2017-01-11 22:00:22	@Espyo	it sounds so fun
2017-01-11 22:02:17	Yoshi2	well, have this screenshot instead http://i.imgur.com/utmHOcY.png
2017-01-11 22:02:48	@Espyo	wow
2017-01-11 22:02:51	@Espyo	love it
2017-01-11 22:03:24	Yoshi2	so basically, first I dumped the memory and searched for stuff of interest with a hex editor because dolphin's search sucks
2017-01-11 22:03:49	Yoshi2	when I find it I use dolphin's memory thing to poke this data and see if it does anything
2017-01-11 22:04:05	Yoshi2	and now I copied a whole piece of data, changed some values and am now putting it inside a code
2017-01-11 22:05:34	@Espyo	well, if you put it like that, it sounds simple
2017-01-11 22:05:41	@Espyo	but it's usually a chore
2017-01-11 22:05:52	@Espyo	I mean, just searching for codes using the cheat finder is a chore
2017-01-11 22:05:56	@Espyo	but doing it that way... eesh
2017-01-11 22:07:51	Yoshi2	I can't find anything with the cheat finder, it needs specific values and if I don't know anything about the value I can't find anything it seems
2017-01-11 22:08:06	@Espyo	but there is an unknown value search
2017-01-11 22:08:13	@Espyo	and you can at least search for increases or decreases
2017-01-11 22:08:19	@Espyo	...unless your Dolphin is a bit outdated
2017-01-11 22:08:27	@Espyo	I remember there was a version where they broke the "initial value unknown" thing
2017-01-11 22:13:16	Yoshi2	then I must've missed the increases/decreases thing
2017-01-11 22:16:24	Yoshi2	actually I do remember using that myself in dolphin, not sure why I didn't find it this time
2017-01-11 22:17:01	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-11 22:17:37	Yoshi2	ALRIGHT now we're rolling
2017-01-11 22:17:39	Yoshi2	or not
2017-01-11 22:17:53	Yoshi2	invalid read, rest in fucking peace :^)
2017-01-11 22:17:59	@Espyo	brill
2017-01-11 22:19:47	Yoshi2	so sad, so very sad
2017-01-11 22:20:26	Yoshi2	ok what if
2017-01-11 22:20:34	Yoshi2	what if I only changed the filename for the terrain
2017-01-11 22:23:02	Yoshi2	because the terrain is first and I know the terrain can be switched around for the levels
2017-01-11 22:24:26	Yoshi2	hmmmm I wonder, maybe I should make a code with an if
2017-01-11 22:45:58	Yoshi2	"Ok so strings are 0-terminated and the strings I want to replace are longer so it will be fine if I just change the string to a shorter one and fill it out with 0s right?"

2017-01-11 22:47:06	@Espyo	you can't just DO that
2017-01-11 22:47:11	@Espyo	you're meant to pad them with spaces
2017-01-11 22:47:30	Yoshi2	i
2017-01-11 22:47:34	Yoshi2	actually have to try that out

2017-01-11 22:55:42	Neocraftz1553	Hello, Yoshi2, Marty2000, Espyo
2017-01-11 22:56:01	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-11 22:56:30	Yoshi2	Espyo: nah didn't change anything, still invalid reads
2017-01-11 22:56:36	@Espyo	damn
2017-01-11 22:56:44	@Espyo	that doesn't add up
2017-01-11 22:56:48	@Espyo	what if you replace it all with "a"s?
2017-01-11 22:57:00	@Espyo	could be a checksum that's failing simply because you touched it
2017-01-11 22:57:03	@Espyo	no matter what you do
2017-01-11 22:58:35	Yoshi2	that will probably fail even more
2017-01-11 22:58:46	Yoshi2	hi neocraftz
2017-01-11 23:02:01	@Espyo	can you even change only one of the strings?
2017-01-11 23:05:48	Yoshi2	I did try to change one string without much success but hmmm, maybe this other string could do the work
2017-01-11 23:09:11	Yoshi2	nope.avi
2017-01-11 23:10:58	Yoshi2	80011ad4 hmwhat
2017-01-11 23:14:05	Yoshi2	ooooooooh
2017-01-11 23:14:08	Yoshi2	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
2017-01-11 23:14:13	Yoshi2	no i did not get it to work but
2017-01-11 23:14:42	Yoshi2	80011ad4 is a piece of code that runs whenever the game's loading screen is triggered
2017-01-11 23:15:40	Neocraftz1553	So...
2017-01-11 23:15:43	Neocraftz1553	What'cha doin?
2017-01-11 23:16:22	Yoshi2	hitting my head against the wall repeatedly until i get brain damage
2017-01-11 23:16:27	Neocraftz1553	Ah
2017-01-11 23:16:44	Yoshi2	aka trying to make a cheat code that does what I want it to do
2017-01-11 23:16:54	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2017-01-11 23:17:00	Neocraftz1553	What's the difference :p
2017-01-11 23:17:12	Yoshi2	exactly
2017-01-11 23:17:21	Neocraftz1553	I'm learning javascript.
2017-01-11 23:17:32	Neocraftz1553	It's going well.
2017-01-11 23:17:36	Yoshi2	nice
2017-01-11 23:17:37	Neocraftz1553	...I think
2017-01-11 23:18:12	Neocraftz1553	With my limited knowledge, I've come up with this piece of simple code: http://pastebin.com/sQ2TtY6L

2017-01-12 19:24:55	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Espyo 
2017-01-12 19:24:59	Yoshi2	& Testyo 
2017-01-12 19:24:59	Testyo	hang on what was her name?
2017-01-12 19:30:13	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-12 19:31:56	Yoshi2	switch presentation sooooon
2017-01-12 19:39:10	Yoshi2	Espyo: today I figured out a way to automatically generate a soundfont out of many .wav files
2017-01-12 19:39:24	@Espyo	soooooon when we're sleeping
2017-01-12 19:39:29	@Espyo	oh, great
2017-01-12 19:42:35	Yoshi2	so basically
2017-01-12 19:44:35	Yoshi2	i have to forget about creating .sf2 using python or any sort of language, too complex and the libs i found were usually for C++
2017-01-12 19:44:43	Yoshi2	instead
2017-01-12 19:44:52	Yoshi2	somebody had the genius idea of making a simple text format
2017-01-12 19:46:33	Yoshi2	called sfz
2017-01-12 19:46:42	Yoshi2	it describes a soundfont but in text
2017-01-12 19:47:16	Yoshi2	and the best part is that there are programs which can convert .sf2 to .sfz and back
2017-01-12 19:48:02	Yoshi2	I made the bare minimum for a soundfont and saved it as a sf2, converted that into .sfz and checked out the contents
2017-01-12 19:49:07	Yoshi2	I copied the text block, plugged it into a python script as a string, replaced some fields with placeholders like {name} and used .format() to fill that with values before writing it back
2017-01-12 19:49:26	Yoshi2	also, python has a library for reading WAVE files which I used to get the size of the sounds
2017-01-12 19:55:06	@Espyo	oh sick
2017-01-12 19:55:12	@Espyo	I love that someone just made sfz
2017-01-12 19:55:35	@Espyo	that's actually pretty ingenious
2017-01-12 19:56:41	Yoshi2	it's very great
2017-01-12 19:56:51	Yoshi2	much easier to write too
2017-01-12 19:57:37	Yoshi2	a programmer's wet dream
2017-01-12 19:58:17	@Espyo	yeeeeah

2017-01-12 20:02:24	Yoshi2	"Are you tired of complicated binary formats that are only writeable with a complex C++ library that would probably take a week to get into by itself? Try THIS format that you can plug into your code as a pattern and fill it up with values using your favorite string format function"
2017-01-12 20:07:34	@Espyo	yep
2017-01-12 20:39:13	Yoshi2	did I mention that I associate this song with Wind Waker modding? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t48raqh-V8c

2017-01-12 20:39:54	BetaMaster64	that's pretty nifty
2017-01-12 20:41:25	@Espyo	wow
2017-01-12 22:15:11	@Espyo	I just refactored some code by using a bit of actual work and a lot of reckless "replace in files"
2017-01-12 22:15:15	@Espyo	and somehow everything's working 100%
2017-01-12 22:15:15	@Espyo	what

2017-01-13 19:10:17	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-01-13 19:10:18	Testyo	some people really prefer the same thing, over and over?
2017-01-13 19:14:16	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-13 19:50:59	Yoshi2	Espyo: as far as I can tell there are 1.4k samples in the pikmin soundbanks (minus the huge wScene0 thing) but only about 500 are unique
2017-01-13 19:51:00	Testyo	1.4 K = -271.75 °C / -457.15 °F
2017-01-13 19:52:22	@Espyo	a
2017-01-13 19:52:24	@Espyo	are you
2017-01-13 19:52:26	@Espyo	I mean
2017-01-13 19:52:29	@Espyo	on one hand, I don't believe it
2017-01-13 19:52:34	@Espyo	since that is actually ridiculous
2017-01-13 19:52:36	@Espyo	but on the other hand
2017-01-13 19:52:37	@Espyo	it's Pikmin 2
2017-01-13 19:52:46	Yoshi2	what part do you not believe
2017-01-13 19:52:56	Yoshi2	the huge amount of samples or that only less than half are unique
2017-01-13 19:53:05	@Espyo	that nearly two thirds of the game's sound files are duplicates
2017-01-13 19:53:51	Yoshi2	it's true
2017-01-13 19:54:06	Yoshi2	either that or the sound files happen to cause lots of md5 collisions
2017-01-13 19:57:56	@Espyo	yikes
2017-01-13 19:57:59	@Espyo	that's a scary thought
2017-01-13 19:58:43	Yoshi2	I was using md5 for detecting the same sound files so when I start writing down the instrument names I don't have to do it over and over again for the same sounds
2017-01-13 20:01:45	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-13 20:08:49	Yoshi2	ok so I took the time to make one SuperFont which has almost all the soundbanks
2017-01-13 20:09:16	Yoshi2	except now i can't switch banks in the program I use to play midis with a soundfont
2017-01-13 20:09:30	Yoshi2	I can manually assign instruments from a different bank but hngg

2017-01-13 20:49:48	Yoshi2	it actually takes a long time to load this sfz stuff in polyphone
2017-01-13 20:49:55	Yoshi2	but conversion to sf2 is pretty quick
2017-01-13 20:50:01	@Espyo	well, at least
2017-01-13 21:21:48	Yoshi2	https://imgur.com/9ugsBUu
2017-01-13 21:22:19	@Espyo	hehe
2017-01-13 21:22:33	@Espyo	so I'm trying to submit my self-evaluations on the company's website
2017-01-13 21:22:39	@Espyo	since the deadline is sunday
2017-01-13 21:22:42	@Espyo	credentials don't work
2017-01-13 21:22:47	@Espyo	monday's gonna be a fun one
2017-01-13 21:31:51	Yoshi2	ripperino
2017-01-13 21:40:08	@J	I would normally just do that stuff at work
2017-01-13 21:40:18	@J	it's work so don't waste your free time on it
2017-01-13 21:44:39	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2017-01-13 21:44:45	@Espyo	plus I get to waste work time not doing real work
2017-01-13 21:44:46	@Espyo	but
2017-01-13 21:44:51	@Espyo	hey, I just delayed it over and over
2017-01-13 21:44:53	@Espyo	and whoops
2017-01-13 22:09:03	Testyo	so the Charger allows me to avoid watched Game Grumps
2017-01-13 22:59:25	@Espyo	hey, what would you prefer?
2017-01-13 22:59:42	@Espyo	imagine you have 20 widgets you want to write down for your GUI
2017-01-13 23:00:02	@Espyo	and in the instruction where you declare their positions and content, you can't declare their more obscure attributes
2017-01-13 23:00:14	@Espyo	like description, or on_mouse_down behavior
2017-01-13 23:00:17	@Espyo	would you do it like
2017-01-13 23:00:36	@Espyo	widget 1 position, widget 2 position, widget 3 position, ... widget 1 properties, widget 2 properties, widget 3 properties, ...
2017-01-13 23:00:38	@Espyo	or
2017-01-13 23:00:49	@Espyo	widget 1 position, widget 1 properties, widget 2 position, widget 2 properties, ...
2017-01-13 23:00:50	@Espyo	?
2017-01-13 23:01:16	@J	I guess the first one
2017-01-13 23:01:30	@J	if the 'properties' parts are matched up with the 'position' parts by some name you give them
2017-01-13 23:01:33	@J	not just by the order
2017-01-13 23:01:45	@Espyo	they're by name, yeah
2017-01-13 23:02:11	@Espyo	hm, just realized that that wasn't even my real question
2017-01-13 23:02:16	@Espyo	I mean, I guess it's a valid question too
2017-01-13 23:02:20	@Espyo	but I misread my own notes here :P
2017-01-13 23:02:33	@Espyo	you have 20 different GUIs
2017-01-13 23:03:02	@Espyo	GUI 1 widget positions, GUI 2 widget positions, ... GUI 1 widget properties, GUI 2 widget properties, ...
2017-01-13 23:03:04	@Espyo	or
2017-01-13 23:03:17	@Espyo	GUI 1 widget positions, GUI 1 widget properties, GUI 2 widget positions, GUI 2 widget properties, ...
2017-01-13 23:05:01	@J	what's a GUI?
2017-01-13 23:05:12	@J	like one screen in a menu system?
2017-01-13 23:05:21	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-13 23:05:51	@J	probably the second in that case

2017-01-13 23:06:16	@J	since with widgets within one screen you probably want to see a small overview of what's there
2017-01-13 23:06:23	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-13 23:06:28	@Espyo	putting it like this, it seems a bit more obvious
2017-01-13 23:06:47	@Espyo	if I add a new widget, I want to write its declaration and position
2017-01-13 23:07:02	@Espyo	and not have to scroll a massive amount of lines to reach the corresponding GUI's widget properties bit
2017-01-13 23:07:10	@Espyo	makes sense
2017-01-13 23:07:12	@Espyo	thanks
2017-01-13 23:08:12	Yoshi2	soon a basic version of my soundfont thingy will be ready and i will release it and hopefully somebody will be kind enough to name the instruments
2017-01-13 23:09:02	@Espyo	that'll be Scruffy then
2017-01-13 23:09:08	@Espyo	I only know the basic ones
2017-01-13 23:09:14	@Espyo	and even then distinguishing between some of them is a nightmare
2017-01-13 23:09:28	@Espyo	hey, you should set up a public document where anybody can edit
2017-01-13 23:09:39	@Espyo	because I can certainly contribute with a few names
2017-01-13 23:09:51	@Espyo	I'm no wiz, but I know one or two
2017-01-13 23:10:03	@Espyo	and then instead of sending my incomplete list over to whoever else wants it
2017-01-13 23:10:11	@Espyo	the next person can just use the same public document and edit what's left
2017-01-13 23:10:51	Yoshi2	mhm yes
2017-01-13 23:11:23	@Espyo	besides Google Docs though... what can you even pick?
2017-01-13 23:11:31	@Espyo	Google Docs is so huge for this
2017-01-13 23:11:35	@Espyo	and bloated euch
2017-01-13 23:12:42	@J	a wiki of course
2017-01-13 23:12:57	Yoshi2	hmmm
2017-01-13 23:13:06	Yoshi2	one that is properly themed even
2017-01-13 23:13:24	Yoshi2	maybe a pikmin wiki? but where will we find one?
2017-01-13 23:15:11	@Espyo	probably on wikia
2017-01-13 23:16:24	Yoshi2	making a wiki page seems like a decent idea, but I wonder where it would fit
2017-01-13 23:17:01	@Espyo	thing is, this is for naming your SF2, right?
2017-01-13 23:17:26	@Espyo	or do you want people to name the sounds from the game's files, and then you map those names onto your SF2?
2017-01-13 23:18:29	Yoshi2	it is for naming the instruments used in Pikmin 2
2017-01-13 23:18:49	@Espyo	ok, but based on what?
2017-01-13 23:18:52	@Espyo	SF2, or game's files?
2017-01-13 23:19:05	Yoshi2	the thing is
2017-01-13 23:19:20	@Espyo	it has to be mapped to *something*
2017-01-13 23:19:32	@Espyo	it can't just be "the stringy sounding instrument with the ech sounds is an oboe"
2017-01-13 23:20:14	Yoshi2	my SF2 literally uses the game's files (or at least the files I managed to dump with wwdumpsnd)
2017-01-13 23:21:10	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-13 23:21:10	Yoshi2	if pikmin 2 already has a list of instrument names that would be great but i don't think it has one
2017-01-13 23:21:33	@Espyo	well, you have to choose one of the two
2017-01-13 23:21:45	Yoshi2	one of which two?
2017-01-13 23:21:59	@Espyo	Yoshi2's SF2 file, bank 1 - sample 3 = Piano
2017-01-13 23:22:00	@Espyo	or
2017-01-13 23:22:33	Yoshi2	I don't think I will go with that one
2017-01-13 23:22:35	@Espyo	wScene_12.aw, instrument 0034 = Piano
2017-01-13 23:23:07	Yoshi2	the instrument list I made so far is like 4ce802def698bc7a9e89d8bf06e658c4=Instrument0=wScene_10.aw_00000000.wav
2017-01-13 23:23:18	Yoshi2	hash=tempname=examplefile
2017-01-13 23:23:31	Yoshi2	but it's really just a matter of rewriting the code a bit to make it look different
2017-01-13 23:23:45	@Espyo	oh
2017-01-13 23:24:05	@Espyo	then yeah, I guess the best way would be for there to be a map with the sounds inside wScene_10.aw
2017-01-13 23:24:07	@Espyo	(and the other files)
2017-01-13 23:24:14	@Espyo	well, in that case
2017-01-13 23:24:21	@Espyo	http://pikmintkb.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page
2017-01-13 23:24:36	@Espyo	a page like "Pikmin 2 instrument map" or something
2017-01-13 23:25:14	Yoshi2	mhm yes that can work
2017-01-13 23:25:30	Yoshi2	but i'd have to make a new account oh joy
2017-01-13 23:25:42	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think I'm allowed to unlock the wiki for anons
2017-01-13 23:25:43	@Espyo	boo wiki farms
2017-01-13 23:28:42	Yoshi2	that will be for when I'm not tired
2017-01-13 23:28:47	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2017-01-13 23:28:50	@Espyo	I hear ya
2017-01-13 23:28:51	@Espyo	night
2017-01-13 23:34:51	Yoshi2|offline	while it is some kind of technical knowledge, i guess I'd be the main person to have something from the info :I
2017-01-13 23:35:37	Yoshi2|offline	but the soundfont will be made regardless of whether the instruments are named Instrument1, Generic Guitar Sound #35 or the proper instrument name
2017-01-13 23:35:55	Yoshi2|offline	plus it will be nice when the BMS project is revived again
2017-01-13 23:36:09	Yoshi2|offline	that is probably also something that could go onto the wiki
2017-01-13 23:39:37	@Espyo	something that could go on which wiki?
2017-01-13 23:39:42	@Espyo	the technical KB, or Pikipedia?

2017-01-14 13:52:03	Yoshi2	before yesterday I didn't know or I forgot the technical one even existed
2017-01-14 13:53:24	@Espyo	heh, it's fine
2017-01-14 20:18:33	Yoshi2	wtffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
2017-01-14 20:18:50	Yoshi2	dolphin has memory breakpoints that you don't have to recompile dolphin for now?!?
2017-01-14 20:19:01	Yoshi2	or was my windows build compiled with that enabled?
2017-01-14 20:19:04	Yoshi2	mysterious
2017-01-14 20:20:42	@Espyo	where are they at?
2017-01-14 20:20:46	@Espyo	I'll check my own
2017-01-14 20:20:57	Yoshi2	so you start dolphin with -d option on
2017-01-14 20:21:04	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-14 20:21:14	Yoshi2	then you go to the memory view
2017-01-14 20:21:25	Yoshi2	pick something that you know is being read
2017-01-14 20:21:34	Yoshi2	and click on the white space to the left of the address
2017-01-14 20:21:43	Yoshi2	a blue circle should pop up
2017-01-14 20:22:10	@Espyo	>[1]    19030 segmentation fault (core dumped)  dolphin-emu -d
2017-01-14 20:22:11	@Espyo	gg
2017-01-14 20:22:18	Yoshi2	and the code actually stops at the point
2017-01-14 20:22:19	Yoshi2	oh
2017-01-14 20:22:23	Yoshi2	rest in pieces
2017-01-14 20:22:28	@Espyo	well, I just picked a random address
2017-01-14 20:22:32	@Espyo	wait, I'll use some address in a cheat code
2017-01-14 20:23:21	@Espyo	huh? it's showing ------ for the value?
2017-01-14 20:23:54	Yoshi2	memory starts at 0x8000000 or something
2017-01-14 20:24:21	@Espyo	this isn't making any sense
2017-01-14 20:24:29	@Espyo	I know that the address 04942A7C is the amount of Pokos you have
2017-01-14 20:24:29	Testyo	7 C = 44.6 °F / 280.15 K
2017-01-14 20:24:37	@Espyo	if I type on that on the search box
2017-01-14 20:24:38	@Espyo	I do go there
2017-01-14 20:24:40	@Espyo	but with no values
2017-01-14 20:24:48	@Espyo	and with what you said, I'm just more confused
2017-01-14 20:25:46	Yoshi2	try going to 0x84942A7C
2017-01-14 20:25:47	Testyo	7 C = 44.6 °F / 280.15 K
2017-01-14 20:26:21	Yoshi2	memory content starts at 0x8blabla, everything below is mapped to that so I guess your address is still valid
2017-01-14 20:26:30	@Espyo	...I needed to append a 0x to the search?
2017-01-14 20:26:31	@Espyo	good grief
2017-01-14 20:26:58	@Espyo	with the emulation paused, it didn't do anything
2017-01-14 20:27:05	@Espyo	with it unpaused, it crashed again
2017-01-14 20:27:10	@Espyo	actually, give me 2 minutes
2017-01-14 20:27:15	@Espyo	I'm currently debugging the engine
2017-01-14 20:27:21	@Espyo	so maybe if two debuggers are debugging stuff together...
2017-01-14 20:27:25	@Espyo	stuff goes bad
2017-01-14 20:28:21	@Espyo	nope, same result
2017-01-14 20:28:31	@Espyo	is there any "add memory breakpoint" option if you right-click?

2017-01-14 21:08:43	Yoshi2	it breaks at the address, I check the instruction and write down the instruction address
2017-01-14 21:09:09	Yoshi2	and I look for the same instruction in the disassembled code of the game I want to port the code to
2017-01-14 21:10:35	@Espyo	heh, nice!
2017-01-14 21:13:53	Yoshi2	8033da30 hmmmmmmmmmm
2017-01-14 21:17:06	Yoshi2	ok that is it
2017-01-14 21:31:04	Yoshi2	it works
2017-01-14 21:31:06	Yoshi2	but
2017-01-14 21:31:14	Yoshi2	somebody already did a similar code
2017-01-14 21:31:21	@Espyo	:|
2017-01-14 21:38:19	Yoshi2	compare the Player Invulnerable code here: http://bsfree.org/index.php?s=16&d=6&g=6174
2017-01-14 21:39:23	Yoshi2	now if I convert that into a wiird code: https://i.imgur.com/WB4QBJt.png
2017-01-14 21:39:51	Yoshi2	>0433DA30 00000001
2017-01-14 21:40:35	Yoshi2	exact same code as what I managed to port
2017-01-14 22:06:09	Yoshi2	Espyo: well, if there is any pikmin stuff that could need memory breakpoints and cheat codes, feel free to tell me
2017-01-14 22:09:34	Yoshi2	I'm acquiring cheat code knowledge that I need to put into use or I will forget it again .-.
2017-01-14 22:10:31	Yoshi2	ooooh i have an idea about how code injection can be done, I should try that sometime
2017-01-14 22:10:36	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-14 22:10:38	@Espyo	afaik, none so far
2017-01-14 22:13:20	Yoshi2	I guess I'll have to continue to hack away at BW1, or I go back to Pikmin 2 and do something with BMS
2017-01-14 22:16:18	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-14 22:17:47	Yoshi2	or i go back to watching anime and being a lazy piece of crap
2017-01-14 22:17:55	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2017-01-14 22:17:59	Yoshi2|offline	yes that sounds like a good idea
2017-01-14 22:18:20	@Espyo	best
2017-01-14 22:19:07	Yoshi2|offline	i want to make a video about me playing panzermädels that a friend gifted to me
2017-01-14 23:52:57	Testyo	it could use Marie's song

2017-01-15 12:49:16	Marty2000	Hi
2017-01-15 12:49:43	Marty2000	Espyo: I've just seen the memo "Does the P3 Onion creating a Pikmin inside thing have a cutscene? Also, can you elaborate on how to get 100 sprouts in P2?"
2017-01-15 12:50:19	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-15 12:50:21	@Espyo	ah, you got it
2017-01-15 12:50:48	Marty2000	So 1) yeah, there's a cutscene 2) 99 Pikmin can be buried by a Snitchbug or Mamuta, and an Onion needs to produce the 100th seed
2017-01-15 12:51:21	Marty2000	The 100th Pikmin cannot be buried by the Snitchbug or Mamuta, it will simply be knocked back
2017-01-15 12:51:28	@Espyo	no, I mean how to get 100 seeds in P2
2017-01-15 12:51:35	@Espyo	oh
2017-01-15 12:51:36	@Espyo	you're explaining
2017-01-15 12:51:37	@Espyo	sorry
2017-01-15 12:51:42	@Espyo	right, I remember that part
2017-01-15 12:51:44	@Espyo	what next?
2017-01-15 12:51:45	Marty2000	Oh, no problem :P
2017-01-15 12:51:52	Marty2000	So, if you want to get 100 seeds...
2017-01-15 12:52:14	Marty2000	you could have like 97 Pikmin buried by Swooping Snitchbugs/Mamutas, and then
2017-01-15 12:52:27	Marty2000	have a Pikmin bring back an enemy to an Onion (one that produces more than three seeds)
2017-01-15 12:52:37	Marty2000	and put the Pikmin back into the Onion before it ejects the seeds
2017-01-15 12:53:16	@Espyo	what enemy requires one Pikmin to carry, but is gives more than 3 seeds?
2017-01-15 12:53:40	Marty2000	The [[Shearwig]]
2017-01-15 12:53:40	Testyo	"Shearwig" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Shearwig
2017-01-15 12:53:48	Marty2000	it produces four seeds
2017-01-15 12:54:05	Marty2000	if you carry it with a White Pikmin, it should work perfectly
2017-01-15 12:55:12	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-15 12:55:28	@Espyo	wouldn't you having 99 buried Pikmin make it easier, though?
2017-01-15 12:56:17	Marty2000	Yeah, it would. That's what I actually did, but I was just giving an example. As long as you get the 100th seed produced by an Onion, it will work
2017-01-15 12:56:43	Marty2000	It also works with Candypop Buds: however, you only find them in caves
2017-01-15 12:56:44	@Espyo	all right
2017-01-15 12:57:12	@Espyo	in that case I'll improve the info I wrote on [[100 Pikmin limit]]
2017-01-15 12:57:13	Testyo	"100_Pikmin_limit" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=100_Pikmin_limit
2017-01-15 12:57:17	Marty2000	Okay ;)
2017-01-15 12:57:45	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Marty2000 
2017-01-15 12:58:10	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2
2017-01-15 12:58:16	Yoshi2	what is this, both of you come online at almost the same time :>
2017-01-15 12:59:18	Marty2000	Well... you know me, I don't sleep early, so... :P
2017-01-15 12:59:20	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-15 12:59:29	@Espyo	heh, true
2017-01-15 12:59:40	@Espyo	hey Marty, can you add this little guide thing to your seed article?
2017-01-15 12:59:46	Yoshi2	there is one thing to not sleep early
2017-01-15 12:59:53	@Espyo	as well as mention how normally, P2 doesn't want you to get 100 seeds
2017-01-15 13:00:01	Yoshi2	and another to not get up until the afternoon :I
2017-01-15 13:00:33	Marty2000	Espyo: yeah, sure, I'm going to add it in just  afew minutes
2017-01-15 13:00:37	Marty2000	a few*
2017-01-15 13:00:43	@Espyo	all right
2017-01-15 13:00:55	@Espyo	hey, in my case, during the week, I go to bed at midnight and wake up at 8
2017-01-15 13:01:01	@Espyo	 8 hours of sleep is nowhere near enough sleep for my body
2017-01-15 13:01:04	@Espyo	so I have to make up for it during the weekend
2017-01-15 13:04:17	Yoshi2	I'm making peace with the idea that i will never be able to sleep for a long time
2017-01-15 13:08:10	Yoshi2	today I managed to find the place in the memory in which the player's position is located
2017-01-15 13:08:13	Yoshi2	so I did this https://i.imgur.com/DViGIDn.png
2017-01-15 13:08:43	Marty2000	Espyo: I wonder if a Mamuta can bury 100 Pikmin in P1, though
2017-01-15 13:12:51	@Espyo	it can
2017-01-15 13:13:11	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure
2017-01-15 13:13:25	@Espyo	ah, moonjump codes
2017-01-15 13:13:27	@Espyo	always important
2017-01-15 13:13:51	Yoshi2	I am not sure how to make a moonjump code out of this
2017-01-15 13:16:12	@Espyo	http://www.geckocodes.org/index.php?arsenal=1
2017-01-15 13:16:21	@Espyo	I'm guessing the idea is like
2017-01-15 13:16:32	@Espyo	one line for "if the X button is pressed"
2017-01-15 13:16:56	@Espyo	"then increase this address (character's Y) by +1"
2017-01-15 13:20:33	Yoshi2	oh wiird has floating point addition in code, neato
2017-01-15 13:20:39	Yoshi2	TIME TO FREAKING DO THIS
2017-01-15 13:23:50	Marty2000	Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User%3AMarty%2FSeed&type=revision&diff=170701&oldid=170606 I'll be honest, I just reused what you already added :P
2017-01-15 13:24:05	Marty2000	and yeah, a Mamuta can bury 100 Pikmin in P1, just checked
2017-01-15 13:25:16	@Espyo	nice copy paste :P
2017-01-15 13:25:21	@Espyo	but all right, now it's pointed down
2017-01-15 13:25:33	@Espyo	though I'm wondering if it should be in the trivia section
2017-01-15 13:25:34	@Espyo	it's a bit big
2017-01-15 13:25:58	@Espyo	hm, I think this would serve as a nice Did You Know
2017-01-15 13:26:04	Marty2000	I can still change it in the future, if you want. 
2017-01-15 13:26:11	@Espyo	eh
2017-01-15 13:26:11	Marty2000	Heh, yeah
2017-01-15 13:26:14	@Espyo	I'm just not a fan of copy-paste
2017-01-15 13:26:15	@Espyo	seems lazy
2017-01-15 13:26:20	Marty2000	or I can simply rename "Others" as "Trivia"

2017-01-15 13:27:10	@Espyo	"Did you know that you cannot get 100 sprouts in Pikmin 2 via enemies, but you can by delivering a corpse and quickly sending the carrier Pikmin back in?"
2017-01-15 13:27:26	@Espyo	oh, I didn't realize the section was called "Others"
2017-01-15 13:27:35	@Espyo	trivia should only be for really loose stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else
2017-01-15 13:27:37	@Espyo	this kinda does
2017-01-15 13:28:11	Yoshi2	ok which address stores the button values
2017-01-15 13:29:01	@Espyo	http://www.geckocodes.org/index.php?arsenal=2
2017-01-15 13:29:30	Yoshi2	yes that still needs the address which stores the button values
2017-01-15 13:29:40	Yoshi2	I guess I have to press buttons and check for value changes
2017-01-15 13:29:43	@Espyo	hmmmmmm
2017-01-15 13:29:48	@Espyo	from what I vaguely remember
2017-01-15 13:29:54	@Espyo	I think you have to find it yourself
2017-01-15 13:29:57	@Espyo	each game stores it somewhere different
2017-01-15 13:30:06	@Espyo	yeah, just press and check for the values that that page gives
2017-01-15 13:30:07	@Espyo	should work
2017-01-15 13:34:41	Yoshi2	found it
2017-01-15 13:34:46	Yoshi2	holy crap this was actually easy
2017-01-15 13:34:58	Yoshi2	enable background input
2017-01-15 13:35:35	Yoshi2	press B, search for equal value (0x0200), leave it, search for not equal value, press again, search for equal
2017-01-15 13:35:59	Yoshi2	strangely, there are several addresses storing if B is being held
2017-01-15 13:36:16	Yoshi2	but only 2 which do the same for all buttons
2017-01-15 13:37:31	Marty2000	Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User%3AMarty%2FSeed&type=revision&diff=170702&oldid=170701

2017-01-15 14:02:51	@Espyo	heh, nice
2017-01-15 14:03:07	@Espyo	heh, that works, Marty
2017-01-15 14:05:54	Yoshi2	oh the floating point operations talk about gecko registers
2017-01-15 14:06:22	Yoshi2	I wonder if that means the actual registers on the console
2017-01-15 14:06:34	@Espyo	something tells me it's not
2017-01-15 14:06:53	Yoshi2	well I will find out in case something goes absolutely wrong
2017-01-15 14:52:22	Yoshi2	ok in the us version controllers are 0x0030F0D0 and 0x004415C0
2017-01-15 14:55:34	Yoshi2	37 possible places in which the position is stored in the us version (different level though)
2017-01-15 14:55:39	Yoshi2	and they ALL could be correct
2017-01-15 14:55:48	Yoshi2	they all go up or down depending on my position
2017-01-15 14:55:53	@Espyo	eesh
2017-01-15 14:56:24	Yoshi2	some are different though
2017-01-15 14:56:30	Yoshi2	but still go up when I go up
2017-01-15 14:56:37	Yoshi2	what is this madness

2017-01-15 15:54:36	Marty2000	Espyo: http://www.pikminwiki.com/2-Player_Battle#Layout_selection I want to test the "left" combinations to see weirdness today. Do you have to press the button on the first player's will remote, on the second player's, both or either?
2017-01-15 15:54:40	Marty2000	Be right back

2017-01-15 15:55:05	@Espyo	"the first player"
2017-01-15 15:55:06	@Espyo	so player 1
2017-01-15 15:56:22	Marty2000	Yeah, player 1
2017-01-15 15:56:24	Marty2000	Thanks
2017-01-15 15:58:46	Marty2000	Also, I'm surprised to see that the leaders are immune to the Watery Blowhog in 2-player mode, didn't know that
2017-01-15 15:59:19	@Espyo	:|
2017-01-15 15:59:19	@Espyo	I
2017-01-15 15:59:23	@Espyo	didn't know that either
2017-01-15 15:59:27	@Espyo	that's not fair
2017-01-15 15:59:41	@Espyo	can you add that to the wiki?
2017-01-15 15:59:55	Marty2000	(and the Fiery Blowhog too, but I guess it makes more sense since you can also be immune to them in Story Mode)
2017-01-15 15:59:59	Marty2000	Yeah, ok
2017-01-15 16:00:02	@Espyo	oh, okay
2017-01-15 16:00:07	@Espyo	I thought it was just the Watery Blowhog
2017-01-15 16:00:15	@Espyo	giving Olimar players a disadvantage
2017-01-15 16:00:25	@Espyo	err *advantage
2017-01-15 16:03:07	Marty2000	Of course, the Pikmin are still immune to their respective element (fire for Reds, water for Blues). and finally, the leaders aren't immune to electricity

2017-01-15 16:14:08	@Espyo	right
2017-01-15 16:32:17	Marty2000	I also didn't know that the enemies spawned from the roulette wheel automatically disappeared after a certain amount of time (1 minute I think)
2017-01-15 16:33:25	Marty2000	Those enemies leave no corpse when defeated/disappearing
2017-01-15 16:34:16	@Espyo	ah, yeah, they do
2017-01-15 16:34:32	@Espyo	well, I know the Withering Blowhog just has its normal death animation
2017-01-15 16:34:40	@Espyo	but what happens to the Fiery and Watery Blowhogs?
2017-01-15 16:34:42	@Espyo	how do they die?
2017-01-15 16:35:28	Marty2000	If they spawned from the roulette, they have their normal death animations as well
2017-01-15 16:37:09	@Espyo	yeah but
2017-01-15 16:37:10	@Espyo	then what?
2017-01-15 16:37:20	Marty2000	They... vanish
2017-01-15 16:37:21	@Espyo	their normal death animations involves them collapsing and falling on their side, then staying there
2017-01-15 16:37:24	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-15 16:37:25	@Espyo	instantly?
2017-01-15 16:37:31	@Espyo	gradually becoming transparent?
2017-01-15 16:37:33	@Espyo	shrinking?
2017-01-15 16:37:40	@Espyo	disappearing into flakes like the Beady Long Legs?
2017-01-15 16:37:55	Marty2000	They perform their death animation, then they instantly disappear
2017-01-15 16:38:08	@Espyo	ah
2017-01-15 17:48:24	Yoshi2	the moonjump code I made only works in a specific level arghhh
2017-01-15 17:53:38	@Espyo	.............ouch
2017-01-15 17:58:12	Yoshi2	well it was still fun to do
2017-01-15 18:09:48	Yoshi2	Espyo Marty2000 has anybody got to 999 days in the pikmin games yet to see what happens?
2017-01-15 18:16:24	@Espyo	pretty sure they have
2017-01-15 18:16:27	@Espyo	goes to 1000 just fine
2017-01-15 18:16:37	@Espyo	the day counter squeezes the number a bit
2017-01-15 18:17:01	Yoshi2	oh ok
2017-01-15 18:17:08	Marty2000	I've never seen 1000 days though
2017-01-15 18:17:16	Marty2000	I'm trying to reach it
2017-01-15 18:17:34	Yoshi2	did espyo lie
2017-01-15 18:18:02	@Espyo	b-but
2017-01-15 18:18:06	@Espyo	I'm PRETTY sure...
2017-01-15 18:18:10	Marty2000	Lol, I don't think so. It must be "quite easy" to reach 1000 days
2017-01-15 18:18:14	Marty2000	just long
2017-01-15 18:20:04	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-1yiGohCTc
2017-01-15 18:25:01	Yoshi2	Espyo: didn't you try to make a pikmin 2 position cheat thing once? Did you have any luck with that?
2017-01-15 18:25:40	@Espyo	I did
2017-01-15 18:25:42	@Espyo	absolutely horrible
2017-01-15 18:25:44	@Espyo	like
2017-01-15 18:25:45	@Espyo	wow
2017-01-15 18:25:52	@Espyo	I couldn't find any address whatsoever
2017-01-15 18:25:55	@Espyo	except one, which BARELY works
2017-01-15 18:26:01	@Espyo	it messes with the character's Y in weird ways
2017-01-15 18:26:09	@Espyo	I can't make heads or tails of it
2017-01-15 18:28:32	Yoshi2	mhm, in the European version?
2017-01-15 18:28:48	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-15 18:28:55	@Espyo	though I think I also tried US at one point just to try my luck
2017-01-15 18:37:54	Yoshi2	I actually can't get a movement code properly using just the "Less than" and "bigger than" feature
2017-01-15 18:38:04	Yoshi2	I wonder if these don't work with floating point values 
2017-01-15 18:38:17	@Espyo	wait, but you found the address with the coordinateS?
2017-01-15 18:38:59	Yoshi2	I found them because I knew the starting position of the player as a float, then I converted it into hex and tested for it using "Equal"
2017-01-15 18:39:20	@Espyo	hm, haven't tried that yet
2017-01-15 18:39:24	@Espyo	please let me know what they are
2017-01-15 18:39:42	@Espyo	also, do you know that the US version already has a moonjump codE?
2017-01-15 18:39:57	Yoshi2	didn't know that
2017-01-15 18:40:07	Yoshi2	have you dissected the code yet?
2017-01-15 18:40:10	@Espyo	nope
2017-01-15 18:40:15	Yoshi2	oh
2017-01-15 18:40:19	Yoshi2	giff code
2017-01-15 18:40:24	Yoshi2	(っ◕‿◕)っ 
2017-01-15 18:40:29	@Espyo	it's bundled in, so it's in the depths of forever
2017-01-15 18:40:34	@Espyo	by which I mean it's not in the usual config files
2017-01-15 18:40:37	@Espyo	stupid Dolphin...
2017-01-15 18:40:42	@Espyo	but gimme a sec
2017-01-15 18:40:47	@Espyo	I think I found where they were the other day
2017-01-15 18:42:04	@Espyo	 0A507008 00000140
2017-01-15 18:42:04	@Espyo	 04E0D9A8 42800000
2017-01-15 18:43:00	Yoshi2	huh that is a short code
2017-01-15 18:43:17	Yoshi2	I found a pal moonjump code here http://www.gc-forever.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1932 but it is longer
2017-01-15 18:43:27	@Espyo	aaaaand it also doesn't work ¬_¬
2017-01-15 18:43:30	@Espyo	that part's important
2017-01-15 18:44:10	Yoshi2	oh it doesn't work
2017-01-15 18:44:13	Yoshi2	does the US code work?
2017-01-15 18:44:20	@Espyo	the US one does
2017-01-15 18:44:28	 *	Yoshi2 rubs his hands
2017-01-15 18:45:31	Yoshi2	I guess that is action replay
2017-01-15 18:46:33	Yoshi2	ok first line is just the button activator
2017-01-15 18:48:33	Yoshi2	it writes 0x42800000 to the address 0x80E0D9A8
2017-01-15 18:48:57	@Espyo	Y speed, maybe?
2017-01-15 18:49:04	@Espyo	what does that value translate to in float?
2017-01-15 18:49:05	Yoshi2	let me do an educated guess, first one is a floating point number and the address has some sort of velocity value
2017-01-15 18:49:12	@Espyo	hah
2017-01-15 18:49:16	@Espyo	we've had the same idea, then
2017-01-15 18:49:46	Yoshi2	138.865
2017-01-15 18:49:58	Yoshi2	https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html
2017-01-15 18:50:08	@Espyo	hmmmm, it's a bit big
2017-01-15 18:50:12	@Espyo	but we don't know the game's units
2017-01-15 18:50:25	@Espyo	that could be units per second, instead of units per frame
2017-01-15 18:50:58	Yoshi2	you could watch the values and see what you get
2017-01-15 18:51:59	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-15 18:52:07	@Espyo	but that'll have to be like tomorrow or something
2017-01-15 19:05:44	Yoshi2	i have 75 minutes footage of me playing panzermädels
2017-01-15 19:05:49	Yoshi2	i only wanted to play it for 20 minutes
2017-01-15 19:10:55	@Espyo	haha
2017-01-15 19:15:41	Yoshi2	now
2017-01-15 19:15:46	Yoshi2	do i WANT to upload it
2017-01-15 19:16:59	Yoshi2	it's a tank dating simulator which comes with
2017-01-15 19:17:10	Yoshi2	stuff that happens in anime on a date i guess
2017-01-15 19:17:20	@Espyo	is your playthrough in German?
2017-01-15 19:19:00	Yoshi2	english
2017-01-15 19:19:11	@Espyo	your commentary, the game, or both?
2017-01-15 19:19:16	Yoshi2	both
2017-01-15 19:19:30	Yoshi2	in fact the game is actually panzermadels
2017-01-15 19:20:00	Yoshi2	(missing the umlaut on the a)
2017-01-15 19:20:06	@Espyo	ah, heh
2017-01-15 19:20:08	@Espyo	my idea was
2017-01-15 19:20:21	@Espyo	if it were in German, there probably aren't many playthroughs of it in German, if any at all
2017-01-15 19:20:21	@Espyo	so yeah
2017-01-15 19:20:26	@Espyo	but since it's in English, iunno
2017-01-15 19:44:55	Yoshi2	i don't want to do german LPs anyway
2017-01-15 19:45:06	Yoshi2	not that much at least
2017-01-15 19:46:49	Yoshi2	the main point of my question was "will uploading this LP have a negative effect or should I just go for it?"
2017-01-15 20:44:54	@Espyo	eeeeeh
2017-01-15 20:45:11	@Espyo	if you think people will associate you with "dat weird weabo with the war tank fetish", then no
2017-01-15 20:45:22	@Espyo	I wouldn't care in your place, but that's me
2017-01-15 21:36:11	Yoshi2	oh it seems I can lower the volume of my voice in the video to 50% and I'm still loud enough
2017-01-15 21:38:58	@Espyo	hm

2017-01-15 22:04:39	@Espyo	what, loud?
2017-01-15 22:04:40	@Espyo	buzzing?
2017-01-15 22:04:44	Yoshi2	I could probably try to filter that out in audacity
2017-01-15 22:04:47	Yoshi2	a short buzz

2017-01-16 21:22:32	Yoshi2	I've spent some time writing down the stuff that happens in the video in the description with timestamps

2017-01-16 21:30:28	Yoshi2	oh my god a new person actually found their way onto the pikminfanon discord
2017-01-16 21:36:40	@Espyo	nice
2017-01-16 21:36:51	@Espyo	there's a fanon discorD?
2017-01-16 21:36:53	@Espyo	there's a fanon discord?
2017-01-16 21:37:00	@Espyo	but either way, isn't it on the front page of fanon?
2017-01-16 21:37:12	@Espyo	 1 hour 16, good grief
2017-01-16 21:37:23	@Espyo	 "70 minutes" doesn't quite hit until you see it in hours

2017-01-16 21:38:00	@Espyo	crap game
2017-01-16 21:38:02	@Espyo	 2/10
2017-01-16 21:39:52	Yoshi2	yup, writing isn't without its flaws
2017-01-16 21:40:25	@Espyo	sad
2017-01-16 21:40:48	Yoshi2	at 19:30 the game really starts to show its actual colors so I recommend watching at least that part
2017-01-16 21:42:01	@Espyo	all right
2017-01-16 21:42:08	@Espyo	though I do know the tagline already
2017-01-16 21:43:19	@Espyo	"have you ever been inside of a tank!?"
2017-01-16 21:43:20	@Espyo	best

2017-01-16 21:44:14	@Espyo	wow, that fourth wall fake-out
2017-01-16 22:01:25	Yoshi2	in that IS-2 date I tried my best at a russian accent thingy
2017-01-16 22:01:33	@Espyo	heh
2017-01-16 22:01:47	@Espyo	a guy speaking English with a German accent, doing a Russian accent
2017-01-16 22:01:48	@Espyo	always works
2017-01-16 22:04:39	Yoshi2	it's quite funny in a way
2017-01-16 22:05:19	Yoshi2	Espyo: also you'd think the pikminfanon discord would be somewhere on the main page but
2017-01-16 22:05:23	Yoshi2	i can't really find it
2017-01-16 22:05:35	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-01-16 22:05:41	@Espyo	I can't remember if PikFan wanted it like that or not
2017-01-16 22:05:44	Yoshi2	oh wait
2017-01-16 22:05:47	Yoshi2	I found it now
2017-01-16 22:05:51	@Espyo	ah
2017-01-16 22:05:53	Yoshi2	under community news <.<
2017-01-16 22:06:16	@Espyo	yeah, and the banner notification at the top
2017-01-16 22:07:08	Yoshi2	oh the banner notification didn't appear because I had javascript disabled
2017-01-16 22:07:21	@Espyo	I don't think that works with Javascript
2017-01-16 22:07:24	@Espyo	well, the hiding part does
2017-01-16 22:07:30	@Espyo	you sure you didn't just dismiss it before?
2017-01-16 22:07:37	@Espyo	it stays dismissed when you press it once
2017-01-16 22:08:47	Yoshi2	it's completely gone if I have scripts disabled for pikminfanon in noscript and appears when I enable it
2017-01-16 22:09:06	Yoshi2	not even the hiding thing is there
2017-01-16 22:09:30	@Espyo	hm, all right then
2017-01-16 22:10:01	Yoshi2	well that makes it even more suprising that it took so long for somebody to find their way onto the discord
2017-01-16 22:10:07	Yoshi2	when it's normally at the top of the page
2017-01-16 22:10:13	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-16 22:10:19	@Espyo	but I guess not a lot of people use Fanon to begin with
2017-01-16 22:10:22	@Espyo	even less see the notices

2017-01-17 18:27:00	Marty2000	Hello
2017-01-17 18:29:05	Yoshi2	hi marty
2017-01-17 18:29:17	Yoshi2	Marty2000: you had a save with a high daycount, right?
2017-01-17 18:34:47	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2. I don't know if you consider "more than 600 days" high
2017-01-17 18:35:06	Marty2000	it's the first save I created (back in 2009) and I still have it :P
2017-01-17 18:35:32	Yoshi2	is it on dolphin or do you have any way to transfer the save onto the pc?
2017-01-17 18:36:13	Marty2000	It's on my Wii U. It is the New Play Control version. It is normally possible to transfer the save with an SD Card
2017-01-17 18:36:55	Marty2000	I know I have an SD Card, I just need to find it and then I can transfer the save if you like
2017-01-17 18:37:40	Yoshi2	I see
2017-01-17 18:37:56	Marty2000	It's the European version of NPCP2
2017-01-17 18:38:34	Yoshi2	would be great if you could give me the save
2017-01-17 18:39:05	Yoshi2	I'm currently figuring out where in the save pikmin 2 stores the day count
2017-01-17 18:39:09	Marty2000	Yeah, okay. I'm just gonna use my MicroSD now ;)
2017-01-17 18:43:18	Marty2000	Yoshi2: http://www.filedropper.com/data_45
2017-01-17 18:46:48	Yoshi2	thx
2017-01-17 18:46:57	Marty2000	No problem
2017-01-17 18:46:59	Yoshi2	hmmm seems like I have to decrypt the save
2017-01-17 18:47:12	Marty2000	You can just use it with Dolphin
2017-01-17 18:48:08	Yoshi2	yes but i want to analyze the save data itself
2017-01-17 18:48:36	Marty2000	Ah, ok, thought you just wanted to use it with Dolphin at first

2017-01-17 18:55:02	Marty2000	and Testyo :P
2017-01-17 18:55:02	Testyo	...it might help you support it doesn't even
2017-01-17 18:55:33	Yoshi2	well looks like decrypting the wii save file isn't so simple
2017-01-17 18:55:37	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-01-17 18:55:37	Testyo	was there actually a problem for me then
2017-01-17 18:58:17	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-17 18:58:19	@Espyo	there kinda was, Testyo
2017-01-17 18:58:20	Testyo	WHY ARE TO PAGE FIVE
2017-01-17 18:58:22	@Espyo	Wine was updating
2017-01-17 18:58:55	Yoshi2	Espyo: I've done some stuff with pikmin 2 savefiles which I also wrote in the pikmin hacking channel on discord
2017-01-17 18:59:47	Yoshi2	as a fun fact, the file select can handle day counts up to 6 digits http://i.imgur.com/HyNJXAO.png
2017-01-17 19:00:43	Marty2000	Bye bye my dreams of reaching a finite number of days... one day
2017-01-17 19:00:52	Marty2000	(without hacking :P)
2017-01-17 19:01:41	Yoshi2	don't worry i still have absolutely no idea what I have to edit to have this day count ingame
2017-01-17 19:03:29	Yoshi2	even with properly editing the save file and recalculating the checksum I've only managed to have it stay on the file select
2017-01-17 19:03:48	Marty2000	I see
2017-01-17 19:03:54	Yoshi2	Espyo: you can contribute to the cause by providing a dolphin save file with a semi-high day count
2017-01-17 19:09:44	@Espyo	awesome!
2017-01-17 19:09:48	@Espyo	and I suppose I can do that
2017-01-17 19:15:09	Yoshi2	best would be a save with >255 days so there is a carry-over but I'll take any with a higher count than what I have
2017-01-17 19:16:02	Yoshi2	marty's would've been perfect but it is from the wii and I am not sure how to decrypt that
2017-01-17 19:18:55	@Espyo	right
2017-01-17 19:30:49	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-01-17 19:31:06	@Espyo	well, the only thing I can do is skip to the end of the day 200+ times
2017-01-17 19:31:50	Yoshi2	by the time you are done with that you could probably make a code that changes the day
2017-01-17 19:31:57	@Espyo	yeah, see
2017-01-17 19:31:58	@Espyo	thing is
2017-01-17 19:32:02	@Espyo	I already tried doing that in the past
2017-01-17 19:32:06	@Espyo	and I don't think it worked?
2017-01-17 19:32:15	@Espyo	 045C4F14 00000001 I've got this here (GC US P2)
2017-01-17 19:32:21	@Espyo	but IIRC, it's a bust
2017-01-17 19:32:31	Yoshi2	doesn't work or isn't permanent?
2017-01-17 19:32:54	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-01-17 19:32:58	@Espyo	been a while since I made it
2017-01-17 19:32:59	@Espyo	lemme test
2017-01-17 19:33:07	@Espyo	hah
2017-01-17 19:33:17	@Espyo	if you try to load the save file with this code on, the game just says it's corrupted
2017-01-17 19:33:54	@Espyo	activating it after the save file was picked has no effect
2017-01-17 19:35:36	@Espyo	...stupid game
2017-01-17 19:35:51	@Espyo	I found 5 addresses that follow the day bubble in the HUD during gameplay
2017-01-17 19:36:01	@Espyo	but none of those follow the number you see on the area select screen
2017-01-17 19:36:35	Yoshi2	that number on the area select screen
2017-01-17 19:36:37	Yoshi2	is a bitch
2017-01-17 19:38:52	@Espyo	this game...
2017-01-17 19:39:57	@Espyo	well, I've got nothing :|
2017-01-17 19:41:53	Yoshi2	i am now watching the number on the area select screen
2017-01-17 19:42:24	@Espyo	...what if that is saved as a string?
2017-01-17 19:43:44	Yoshi2	0x005C84F4 stores the day number even ingame, but there are three other places that store the day number during the area select
2017-01-17 19:46:04	Yoshi2	no changing that address didn't do shitttt
2017-01-17 19:46:52	Yoshi2	next one is DF7A94
2017-01-17 19:47:51	Yoshi2	DF7A94 stores the number on the area select screen
2017-01-17 19:50:20	Yoshi2	0x81279E3C has it too
2017-01-17 19:50:21	Testyo	3 C = 37.4 °F / 276.15 K
2017-01-17 19:50:34	Yoshi2	and there is another copy of the number right after tha
2017-01-17 19:50:35	Yoshi2	t
2017-01-17 19:51:29	Yoshi2	what
2017-01-17 19:51:36	Yoshi2	it jumps back to E if I change that
2017-01-17 19:52:55	@Espyo	nonsense
2017-01-17 19:52:56	Yoshi2	OK I CHANGED ALL 4
2017-01-17 19:53:06	Yoshi2	i think it doesn't jump back now
2017-01-17 19:53:09	Yoshi2	i have high hopes
2017-01-17 19:53:24	Yoshi2	i will get to the bottom of this day count thing
2017-01-17 19:54:47	Yoshi2	I ended the game and it's back to the unchanged number
2017-01-17 19:55:22	Yoshi2	maybe the daycount is stored as a short after all
2017-01-17 19:58:23	Yoshi2	...............................................................................................
2017-01-17 19:58:48	Yoshi2	let's try an 8 byte search even though that would make no sense
2017-01-17 19:58:54	Yoshi2	*8 bit
2017-01-17 19:58:57	@Espyo	it wouldn't, but it would in Pikmin 2 world
2017-01-17 19:59:08	@Espyo	heck, it'd make sense if it's stored as a string representation of the hex value of the number
2017-01-17 20:00:53	Yoshi2	suddenly I have 8 possible addresses
2017-01-17 20:03:32	Yoshi2	7 addresses
2017-01-17 20:04:27	Yoshi2	could it be possible
2017-01-17 20:04:33	Yoshi2	one of these are my salvation
2017-01-17 20:10:17	Yoshi2	ok I made AR codes for all of them
2017-01-17 20:10:22	Yoshi2	don't let me down game
2017-01-17 20:10:49	Yoshi2	brain does not compute
2017-01-17 20:11:22	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 does not compute
2017-01-17 20:12:18	Yoshi2	game crashed now actually
2017-01-17 20:13:53	Yoshi2	or not completely crashed but it doesn't start up now
2017-01-17 20:13:59	@Espyo	:|
2017-01-17 20:14:31	Yoshi2	froze at 0fps
2017-01-17 20:14:38	Yoshi2	but it isn't a crash, it is still doing stuff
2017-01-17 20:20:31	Yoshi2	what if I disable the cheats before ending the day
2017-01-17 20:20:58	@Espyo	that would stop it freezing, but it probably wouldn't get you anywhere...
2017-01-17 20:21:09	Yoshi2	no still fucks up
2017-01-17 20:21:30	Yoshi2	ok different strat
2017-01-17 20:23:06	Yoshi2	i will search for cheats but this time in the level
2017-01-17 20:28:54	Yoshi2	ok ingame are 7 offsets I can deal with
2017-01-17 20:30:52	Yoshi2	wtf
2017-01-17 20:31:05	@Espyo	lol
2017-01-17 20:31:31	Yoshi2	i disabled a cheat and the number fell back to the original one
2017-01-17 20:31:54	@Espyo	meaning it's saving the "real" value somewhere else
2017-01-17 20:32:00	@Espyo	...and with some stupid representation, no doubt
2017-01-17 20:32:11	Yoshi2	well
2017-01-17 20:34:16	Yoshi2	what if I end the day with cheats enabled
2017-01-17 20:35:00	Yoshi2	warnings
2017-01-17 20:35:41	Yoshi2	pc=0x80454d44 
2017-01-17 20:35:45	Yoshi2	aaaand game froze
2017-01-17 20:35:49	Yoshi2	nintendo
2017-01-17 20:35:52	Yoshi2	REALLY 
2017-01-17 20:35:58	Yoshi2	doesn't want us to mess around with the days

2017-01-17 20:46:41	Yoshi2	i have an idea
2017-01-17 20:46:51	Yoshi2	what if I set a memory break point
2017-01-17 20:47:40	Yoshi2	OH MY GOD
2017-01-17 20:47:42	Yoshi2	WHAT IF
2017-01-17 20:47:55	Yoshi2	NINTENDO RESERVED A WHOLE GAMECUBE REGISTER
2017-01-17 20:47:59	Yoshi2	FOR THE DAY VALUE
2017-01-17 20:48:09	@Espyo	...................................................
2017-01-17 20:48:14	@Espyo	that
2017-01-17 20:48:16	@Espyo	is actually plausible
2017-01-17 20:48:18	@Espyo	sigh
2017-01-17 20:48:30	Yoshi2	so we can't find the actual value
2017-01-17 20:48:36	Yoshi2	because it is never in the memory
2017-01-17 20:49:16	Yoshi2	anyway if you are curious I think 0x800051DC writes the value to the bubble in the top right ingame
2017-01-17 20:49:34	@Espyo	unfortunately, in and of itself, it's useless...
2017-01-17 20:50:36	Yoshi2	less useless than the location of the bubble value
2017-01-17 20:51:17	Yoshi2	now i just need to follow this instruction to the end of time
2017-01-17 20:52:45	Yoshi2	0x80304418 also writes the value....
2017-01-17 20:54:27	Yoshi2	will the real <instruction that writes the value> please stand up?
2017-01-17 20:55:41	@Espyo	I swear, we gotta start typing these sort of things down
2017-01-17 20:55:49	@Espyo	I want to one day write a book about Pikmin 2's shenanigans
2017-01-17 20:55:55	@Espyo	and stuff like this will be important
2017-01-17 20:56:01	@Espyo	I mean, I WOULD write it, if I had the time :^)
2017-01-17 20:56:20	 *	Yoshi2 looks at Marty2000 
2017-01-17 20:57:57	 *	Marty2000 suddenly feels threatened for no apparent reason.
2017-01-17 20:58:17	Marty2000	:P
2017-01-17 20:58:45	Marty2000	That book would be huge, hah
2017-01-17 20:59:03	@Espyo	bits and pieces of it are already on Pikipedia
2017-01-17 20:59:14	@Espyo	but if I were to write it, I'd add details on why this or that is nonsense
2017-01-17 20:59:19	@Espyo	hopefully in a programmer-helpful way
2017-01-17 21:06:49	Yoshi2	ok the one with 0x8030blabla reads the value, the one with 51dc writes it
2017-01-17 21:06:55	Yoshi2	time to follow it
2017-01-17 21:11:50	Yoshi2	ok one major error I did here:
2017-01-17 21:12:00	Yoshi2	the instruction reads other addresses too
2017-01-17 21:12:29	Yoshi2	so I can't just set a breakpoint there
2017-01-17 21:18:00	Yoshi2	oh
2017-01-17 21:18:15	Yoshi2	i think my memory breakpoint is off by a bit
2017-01-17 21:18:58	Yoshi2	I think I should set it on the address below the address I am trying to mod
2017-01-17 21:25:29	<--	Marty2000 (Mibbit@eexm-4-1959-50.w75-979.abo.wanadoo.fr) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2017-01-17 21:28:51	Yoshi2	ok i got it, seems I have to set more specific memory break points because this thing writes separate bytes
2017-01-17 21:29:43	Yoshi2	it's still the same function though
2017-01-17 21:29:47	Yoshi2	just different values
2017-01-17 21:32:03	Yoshi2	hmm so if I got it right 0x8053193F has the value from which this day value was read
2017-01-17 21:32:03	Testyo	8053193 F = 4.47398e+006 °C / 4.47425e+006 K
2017-01-17 21:35:12	Yoshi2	but why
2017-01-17 21:35:23	Yoshi2	that value is also set back when I change it
2017-01-17 21:35:28	Yoshi2	how deep does this rabbit hole go
2017-01-17 21:37:50	Yoshi2	what the heck is psmtxconcat
2017-01-17 21:40:43	Yoshi2	ok
2017-01-17 21:41:08	@Espyo	psm... texture concatenation?
2017-01-17 21:41:14	@Espyo	wait, text concatenation 
2017-01-17 21:41:16	@Espyo	duh >_>
2017-01-17 21:41:22	@Espyo	but what's psm...?
2017-01-17 21:58:49	Yoshi2	oops I am a bit lost now
2017-01-17 22:03:34	Yoshi2	why am i unable to add more than one watched memory address at a time
2017-01-17 22:03:35	Yoshi2	ugh
2017-01-17 22:04:21	@Espyo	ouch
2017-01-17 22:15:58	Yoshi2	oh "Add to watch" works only when it wants to the way it wants to
2017-01-17 22:16:43	@Espyo	<_>
2017-01-17 22:17:31	Yoshi2	i added a slightly different address to watch
2017-01-17 22:18:40	Yoshi2	ok i got it now
2017-01-17 22:19:07	Yoshi2	I think I had to set the address in the bar in the top right to a 4 byte aligned one
2017-01-17 22:19:25	Yoshi2	one issue I have is
2017-01-17 22:19:47	Yoshi2	if I understand it right, the days count being read from exists in a highly volatile state of memory
2017-01-17 22:20:30	@Espyo	oh man
2017-01-17 22:23:22	Yoshi2	well lets see if i can catch the moment in which a specific value is written before i fall asleep
2017-01-17 22:24:16	Yoshi2	it might be some kind of stack 
2017-01-17 22:24:21	Yoshi2	or worse yet, a heap

2017-01-17 22:40:07	Yoshi2	"Keep pressing start until THIS value changes to XYZ"
2017-01-17 22:40:24	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-17 22:43:24	Yoshi2	OH CRAP I MISSED IT
2017-01-17 22:44:54	Yoshi2	well i am not doing this again
2017-01-17 22:44:57	Yoshi2	not right now
2017-01-17 22:45:45	Yoshi2	at least my theory is right
2017-01-17 22:46:09	Yoshi2	which is that a highly volatile value is resetting it
2017-01-17 22:46:18	Yoshi2	the day count i mean
2017-01-17 22:48:44	@Espyo	yikes
2017-01-17 22:52:21	Yoshi2	here is the script I wrote earlier to calculate checksum of a p2 save file entry https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/e0d93dde832b63f9197ef60861f22d89

2017-01-18 19:30:10	Yoshi2	who the heck was that
2017-01-18 19:33:32	@Espyo	wait, which channel was this?
2017-01-18 19:33:43	Yoshi2	this channel
2017-01-18 19:33:58	@Espyo	who's buffextras?
2017-01-18 19:34:40	Yoshi2	my irc bouncer puts quit/join messages in a fake user called *buffextras
2017-01-18 19:35:23	@Espyo	convoluted, but all right
2017-01-18 19:35:32	@Espyo	anyway the nickname is kiiinda familiar?
2017-01-18 19:35:33	@Espyo	but no idea
2017-01-18 19:35:35	@Espyo	what in the world is vitcon?
2017-01-18 19:36:20	Yoshi2	good question
2017-01-18 19:36:32	@Espyo	http://vitcon.boards.net/
2017-01-18 19:36:35	@Espyo	this isn't answering anything
2017-01-18 19:36:52	@Espyo	it
2017-01-18 19:37:08	@Espyo	kinda looks like he thought the channel was for discussing those forums
2017-01-18 19:37:12	@Espyo	I guess the comment makes sense then
2017-01-18 19:37:23	@Espyo	he thought the forums would only have vitcon users (some convention?), but there are others there too
2017-01-18 19:37:34	@Espyo	...but HOW IN THE WORLD do you mix up Pikipedia's chat with vitcon?!
2017-01-18 19:37:41	@Espyo	maybe a Mibbit glitch?
2017-01-18 19:42:58	Yoshi2	¯\(ツ)/¯  
2017-01-18 19:43:31	Yoshi2	http://pikmintkb.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Pikmin_2_memory_addresses also I THINK those are halfs of a action replay code
2017-01-18 19:49:49	@Espyo	same thing, really, isn't it?
2017-01-18 19:55:44	Yoshi2	not entirely
2017-01-18 19:56:14	Yoshi2	they do contain the memory address but they aren't just the memory address
2017-01-18 19:57:23	@Espyo	they're also the first part that says what to do with the address, right?
2017-01-18 19:57:56	Yoshi2	yes, first two digits are the code type
2017-01-18 19:58:07	Yoshi2	02 is a 16 bit write, 04 is a 32 bit write
2017-01-18 19:58:13	@Espyo	right
2017-01-18 19:58:24	@Espyo	I could've just added those addresses to the page with AR codes
2017-01-18 19:58:28	@Espyo	and turn them into codes
2017-01-18 19:58:36	@Espyo	but eeeh I can't be bothered to make codes out of them, simple as it may be
2017-01-18 19:58:45	@Espyo	I just want to share my findings
2017-01-18 19:58:49	@Espyo	it can be made pretty later
2017-01-18 19:58:55	Yoshi2	https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/wiki/GameCube-ActionReplay-Code-Types-(Simple-Version)#writes
2017-01-18 20:01:35	Yoshi2	Espyo: this is fine for a page name, right http://pikmintkb.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Pikmin_2_save_file
2017-01-18 20:01:43	Yoshi2	(haven't created the page yet)
2017-01-18 20:01:55	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 save file format would probably be better
2017-01-18 20:02:09	@Espyo	but hey, that other guy just wrote a page with "<user name>'s notes" so *shrug*
2017-01-18 20:02:17	Yoshi2	fair enough
2017-01-18 20:02:17	@Espyo	honestly, at this point, I just want info down
2017-01-18 20:02:20	@Espyo	screw policies and the like
2017-01-18 20:02:22	@Espyo	that's a Pikipedia thing
2017-01-18 20:02:30	@Espyo	although having the info organized is still for the best, but
2017-01-18 20:03:31	Yoshi2	well I will do my best
2017-01-18 20:05:38	@Espyo	all right, good luck

2017-01-18 22:42:48	Yoshi2	I SET A SAVESTATE HERE SO I WONT LOSE IT
2017-01-18 22:42:51	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-18 22:42:54	@Espyo	and BACKUP THE SAVE
2017-01-18 22:42:57	Yoshi2	the instruction that sets the value
2017-01-18 22:43:11	Yoshi2	OK so if  I get this assembler right,
2017-01-18 22:43:16	Yoshi2	somewhere is a value 0x13
2017-01-18 22:43:21	Yoshi2	and it loads 0x13
2017-01-18 22:43:24	Yoshi2	adds 1 to it
2017-01-18 22:43:34	Yoshi2	and resets this day value
2017-01-18 22:43:39	Yoshi2	are you telling me
2017-01-18 22:43:50	Yoshi2	somewhere the game keeps track of the previous day value?
2017-01-18 22:44:21	@Espyo	........
2017-01-18 22:44:31	@Espyo	oh, uh
2017-01-18 22:44:38	@Espyo	...maybe the count starts at zero?
2017-01-18 22:44:57	Yoshi2	.
2017-01-18 22:45:00	Yoshi2	....
2017-01-18 22:45:21	Yoshi2	i am internally screaming right now
2017-01-18 22:45:42	Yoshi2	that is a valid possibility

2017-01-18 22:47:38	Neocraftz1553	wyd?
2017-01-18 22:48:04	Yoshi2	testing the theory that maybe the day count in pikmin 2 starts at 0 and not at 1

2017-01-18 22:48:19	Neocraftz1553	How's it going?
2017-01-18 22:49:00	Yoshi2	well a few minutes ago I was wondering if maybe somewhere the game keeps track of the previous day value
2017-01-18 22:49:36	Yoshi2	and espyo suggested that maybe the day count starts at 0 (ergo all days in memory are 1 smaller than what I was looking for)
2017-01-18 22:50:10	Yoshi2	and i am currently internally screaming because i didn't think of that
2017-01-18 22:50:10	Neocraftz1553	Hmm...
2017-01-18 22:50:11	@Espyo	it makes sense that they'd do that to optimize the variable's number range
2017-01-18 22:50:19	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2017-01-18 22:50:23	@Espyo	...but what difference does ONE more day make when you can already store thirty thousand?

2017-01-19 18:54:03	Marty2000	Nice, Testyo
2017-01-19 18:54:04	Testyo	Anyway I have like a 5 page paper thats due next Tuesday so I'm trying to get it still was bad.
2017-01-19 18:55:37	Marty2000	I've noticed something with the seesaw blocks in P2 today, lemme get screenshots
2017-01-19 18:58:31	@Espyo	oh?
2017-01-19 19:03:22	Marty2000	When a Pikmin is on a seesaw block, its weight is shown, right? Not for a leader, right? ( http://imgur.com/kjQAm1C ) However, if you are on a seesaw block and you open the pause menu...
2017-01-19 19:03:23	Testyo	1 C = 33.8 °F / 274.15 K
2017-01-19 19:03:29	Marty2000	The weight of the leader is shown:
2017-01-19 19:03:30	Marty2000	http://imgur.com/sl0PaOR
2017-01-19 19:03:39	Marty2000	It disappears when you close the menu:
2017-01-19 19:03:40	Marty2000	http://imgur.com/OMXsnEH
2017-01-19 19:03:57	Marty2000	I don't know why that happens
2017-01-19 19:04:15	Marty2000	It works on the NPC version as well.
2017-01-19 19:04:22	Yoshi2	are you telling me
2017-01-19 19:04:26	Yoshi2	olimar is weightless
2017-01-19 19:04:33	Marty2000	Yeah
2017-01-19 19:04:41	Marty2000	For a seesaw block, it is ;)
2017-01-19 19:04:46	Marty2000	For a Pikmin, it isn't
2017-01-19 19:04:56	Yoshi2	how do you get the 0 to show?
2017-01-19 19:05:19	Marty2000	Just open the pause menu with Olimar or another leader you're controlling on a seesaw block
2017-01-19 19:05:22	Marty2000	and no Pikmin with you
2017-01-19 19:08:24	@Espyo	what the fuck
2017-01-19 19:08:32	@Espyo	why can't this game bother to make SENSE for once?!
2017-01-19 19:08:55	@Espyo	lemme take a look with free-cam
2017-01-19 19:11:25	Yoshi2	"why can't this game bother to make SENSE for once?!"
2017-01-19 19:13:06	@Espyo	every day it's something :P
2017-01-19 19:13:13	@Espyo	anyway yeah, I can't find any more info
2017-01-19 19:13:16	@Espyo	it really is that
2017-01-19 19:13:21	@Espyo	with no Pikmin, the 0/1 appears
2017-01-19 19:13:27	@Espyo	with Pikmin, the number that's already there is not affected
2017-01-19 19:13:35	@Espyo	wait, what if you're holding one?
2017-01-19 19:14:07	@Espyo	it already shows 1/1 when you're holding
2017-01-19 19:16:58	@Espyo	Marty2000: please add this info to the wiki
2017-01-19 19:17:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2017-01-19 19:17:06	@Espyo	I'd say as trivia on the seesaw article
2017-01-19 19:18:43	Marty2000	Want a screenshot with the 0/1 added to it?
2017-01-19 19:19:50	@Espyo	yes please
2017-01-19 19:19:57	@Espyo	I don't think it's that necessary, but it adds a nice flair
2017-01-19 19:20:37	Marty2000	Yeah, I think a screenshot would be nice

2017-01-19 19:28:54	@Espyo	one thing
2017-01-19 19:29:24	@Espyo	since in this case, it doesn't matter if the image is aligned to the top of the section or starts at the second bullet point, it's better to just put it aligned to the top
2017-01-19 19:29:27	@Espyo	otherwise the space is too big
2017-01-19 19:29:36	@Espyo	the space between the Trivia section and the next one
2017-01-19 19:30:05	@Espyo	also, I'll change the caption a bit, since I think it's a bit misleading
2017-01-19 19:30:09	@Espyo	making readers think it's Olimar only
2017-01-19 19:30:51	Marty2000	Okay

2017-01-20 19:02:56	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-01-20 19:02:57	Testyo	I wish I had it instead of [[Pi...
2017-01-20 19:07:25	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-20 19:12:13	Yoshi2	day count in pikmin 2 is definitely unsigned
2017-01-20 19:13:01	Yoshi2	so that's a bit over 4 billion days you have to go through if you want to overflow the day count
2017-01-20 19:13:47	Yoshi2	(ok it would still be 4 billion days with signed)
2017-01-20 19:26:38	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-01-20 20:08:33	Yoshi2	IT'S TIME FOR
2017-01-20 20:08:34	Yoshi2	B
2017-01-20 20:08:35	Yoshi2	M
2017-01-20 20:08:37	Yoshi2	SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
2017-01-20 20:08:48	Yoshi2	let's see if i can set a memory breakpoint
2017-01-20 20:09:14	@Espyo	#hype
2017-01-20 20:17:22	Yoshi2	breakpoint set
2017-01-20 20:17:30	Yoshi2	wtf do i do with this
2017-01-20 20:17:48	@Espyo	pray?
2017-01-20 20:19:52	Yoshi2	in theory i should be able to step through this
2017-01-20 20:20:12	Yoshi2	in practice PLS KILL ME ALREADY
2017-01-20 20:33:11	Yoshi2	time to use this as a glorified notepad
2017-01-20 20:35:27	Yoshi2	interesting instructions: 0x8009e268 (reads command IDs?) 0x8009cb1c (reads a piece of data for a command maybe?)
2017-01-20 20:35:27	Testyo	1 C = 33.8 °F / 274.15 K

2017-01-20 21:32:34	Yoshi2	this is kind of boring tbh
2017-01-20 21:35:57	Yoshi2	can somebody else just set a memory break over the entire bms data and then step through the code and write down all misc info
2017-01-20 21:36:02	Yoshi2	that would be great
2017-01-20 21:36:13	@Espyo	nothing will ever be great in this mission
2017-01-20 21:49:31	Yoshi2	it's sad because figuring out what the assembler does is a fun puzzle
2017-01-20 21:51:00	@Espyo	it's a fun puzzle with awful controls
2017-01-20 21:51:12	@Espyo	like a pound-shop Rubik's Cube
2017-01-20 21:51:47	@Espyo	it's fun to solve and all, but rotating the parts is like trying to turn a faucet with chopsticks
2017-01-20 21:51:59	@Espyo	...
2017-01-20 21:52:04	@Espyo	I just used an analogy in my analoggy
2017-01-20 21:52:06	@Espyo	*analogy
2017-01-20 21:52:10	@Espyo	is that even a legal thing to do?
2017-01-20 21:56:23	Yoshi2	analogy in an analogy
2017-01-20 21:56:36	Yoshi2	turn yourself in pls
2017-01-20 21:59:21	@Espyo	I must RIP now
2017-01-20 22:03:17	Yoshi2	it's a bit more fun than rubik's cube
2017-01-20 22:07:14	Yoshi2	go to the instruction, read up on the assembler guide to get what it does, look up values in the registers
2017-01-20 22:08:16	@Espyo	still, for billions of instructions
2017-01-20 22:08:23	@Espyo	how in the world do you even know where you ARE?
2017-01-20 22:10:04	Yoshi2	thank god for memory breaks so i have a rough reference point
2017-01-20 22:11:40	Yoshi2	bed time now or else it will be me who goes rip

2017-01-20 22:14:33	@Espyo	night
2017-01-20 22:14:44	@Espyo	I suppose memory breakpoints help
2017-01-20 22:14:46	@Espyo	but still
2017-01-20 22:14:52	@Espyo	I'd love it if you could make a tutorial one day
2017-01-20 22:14:57	Yoshi2|offline	on what
2017-01-20 22:16:02	@Espyo	on the best ways to go about understanding what the game is doing, using assembly and memory breakpoints in Dolphin
2017-01-20 22:17:12	Yoshi2|offline	mhm
2017-01-20 22:18:20	Yoshi2|offline	it takes a lot of educated guesswork
2017-01-20 22:19:10	@Espyo	you always have been pretty good at that
2017-01-20 22:19:19	@Espyo	you've already reverse-engineered a fair amount of file formats
2017-01-20 22:19:23	@Espyo	which is pretty much almost all guesswork
2017-01-20 22:19:28	@Espyo	but me? I can never for the life of me
2017-01-20 22:19:50	@Espyo	either all of the patterns and logic I try to go for end up missing the mark by bad luck, or I'm just really bad at it
2017-01-20 22:22:43	Yoshi2|offline	I've only really started messing with the assembler since I got memory breakpoints to work
2017-01-20 22:22:55	Yoshi2|offline	and for memory breakpoints you need addresses
2017-01-20 22:23:14	Yoshi2|offline	for addresses you have to hope you get lucky with the cheat search
2017-01-20 22:23:38	Yoshi2|offline	or you know what to look for (e.g. the game loads a file into ram so you can just look for contents of the file in the ram)
2017-01-20 22:23:39	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-20 22:23:47	@Espyo	at least I do okay with address searching
2017-01-20 22:23:55	@Espyo	I've messed a fair amount with Cheat Engine back in the day
2017-01-20 22:24:05	@Espyo	oh yeah, good idea

2017-01-20 23:14:13	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, can the Engine recognize and use variables in the txt files? Like, if condition x is met, then set variable y to 200.
2017-01-20 23:16:30	@Espyo	depends on what you're talking about
2017-01-20 23:16:33	@Espyo	enemy scripts?
2017-01-20 23:16:40	@Espyo	or variables like accessing the raw code of the engine?
2017-01-20 23:17:43	Neocraftz1553	enemy scripts.
2017-01-20 23:18:05	@Espyo	currently, only for variables inside the enemy itself
2017-01-20 23:18:20	@Espyo	and the conditions are only the current script conditions, like "gets close to a Pikmin", "reaches home", etc.

2017-01-21 12:51:51	Marty2000	Hello
2017-01-21 12:52:51	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-21 12:52:54	Yoshi2	hi marty
2017-01-21 12:55:37	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Yoshi2
2017-01-21 14:01:21	Yoshi2	8009e268 is the first instruction to fire off on a memory break on start of the level, neat
2017-01-21 14:16:20	Yoshi2	me_irl http://i.imgur.com/2rkmTog.png
2017-01-21 14:16:49	@Espyo	this is the kind of screenshot you show your grandparents when they ask you what you do for a living
2017-01-21 14:16:54	@Espyo	and then look at their face of horror
2017-01-21 14:17:41	Yoshi2	i don't even do this for a living
2017-01-21 14:20:58	@Espyo	you don't need to
2017-01-21 14:21:02	@Espyo	the horror look will be the same
2017-01-21 14:21:59	Yoshi2	heh
2017-01-21 14:55:50	Yoshi2	don't you love such nicely named instructions like
2017-01-21 14:55:53	Yoshi2	rlwinm.
2017-01-21 14:56:02	Yoshi2	(yes that dot is important)
2017-01-21 14:57:48	@Espyo	pffthaha
2017-01-21 14:57:51	@Espyo	what even
2017-01-21 14:58:00	@Espyo	right-to-left... window... management? ...period?
2017-01-21 15:00:01	Yoshi2	 Rotate Left Word Immediate then AND with Mask
2017-01-21 15:00:30	@Espyo	okay... that's fair...
2017-01-21 15:00:33	@Espyo	but what's with the period?
2017-01-21 15:01:58	Yoshi2	"Contrary to the Intel processors the ADD instruction will not modify any flags. To achieve this you have to apped a dot to the instruction. So add. will set the CR bits 0-3 (CR0) in the CR register. These bits will then reflect a signed comparison of the result to zero. In effect the dot adds a cmpwi rD,0 instruction to the ADD instruction. A dot can be added to many PowerPC instructions. "
2017-01-21 15:03:27	@Espyo	I...................... guess it's useful for performance reasons...?
2017-01-21 15:03:42	@Espyo	I mean, I suppose you don't always have to check for the 0 flag or the overflow flag when you use an ADD
2017-01-21 15:03:53	@Espyo	so might as well go with the "lite" version of ADD

2017-01-21 19:54:35	Yoshi2	ok now what the heck did rlwinm do again?
2017-01-21 19:54:42	Yoshi2	it has a million arguments
2017-01-21 19:57:51	@Espyo	._.
2017-01-21 19:59:55	Yoshi2	rlwinm r0, r26, 0, 24, 24 ok
2017-01-21 20:00:31	@Espyo	I thought stuff in assembly could only take two parameters at most
2017-01-21 20:02:17	Yoshi2	so content of r26 is rotated left by 0 bits and then it is AND'ed with a mask whose bits from 24th bit to 24th bit are set to 1
2017-01-21 20:02:46	@Espyo	that's richer than I expected
2017-01-21 20:09:07	Yoshi2	ok so it ANDs the value with 0x80
2017-01-21 20:09:10	Yoshi2	but
2017-01-21 20:09:13	Yoshi2	why
2017-01-21 20:10:33	@Espyo	to get the first bit, of course
2017-01-21 20:10:49	@Espyo	err, last bit
2017-01-21 20:11:41	Yoshi2	most significant bit in the byte
2017-01-21 20:12:40	Yoshi2	ok now it checks the thing for whether it is bigger, smaller or equal to 0
2017-01-21 20:13:01	Yoshi2	result in CR register is 4, that's... 100 in bits
2017-01-21 20:15:48	Yoshi2	according to this that means 0x80 is smaller than 0
2017-01-21 20:16:09	Yoshi2	which kinda makes sense
2017-01-21 20:16:18	Yoshi2	actually hold your horses
2017-01-21 20:16:35	Yoshi2	how does the cpu know when to do an 8 bit, 16 bit or 32 bit signed comparison?!
2017-01-21 20:18:24	@Espyo	well, if this is rlwinm, and w is for word...
2017-01-21 20:18:35	@Espyo	then both the rotate, the AND, and the comparisons should be on words
2017-01-21 20:18:39	@Espyo	which are 32, I think?
2017-01-21 20:18:51	@Espyo	oh, unless you mean when does it know to do signed vs unsigned

2017-01-21 21:35:03	Yoshi2	i had a good run but now i am lost
2017-01-21 21:35:16	Yoshi2	what the heck is this code doing

2017-01-21 21:41:44	@Espyo	you sure you didn't just get lost, and counted two when it only shifted one?
2017-01-21 21:42:08	Yoshi2	no it definitely shifted two and i still have the value in sight
2017-01-21 21:42:36	@Espyo	"assembly"? more like "randomness"
2017-01-21 21:42:45	Yoshi2	and I still have the register in sight that is still storing the loaded command value
2017-01-21 21:48:57	Yoshi2	i actually think i set the memory breakpoint incorrectly
2017-01-21 21:49:33	Yoshi2	... or it shifted since my last start (oh god i hope not)

2017-01-22 13:00:10	Testyo	best age dreams
2017-01-22 13:00:29	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-22 13:09:45	Yoshi2	i am still confused about how cmpwi works
2017-01-22 13:10:03	@Espyo	compare word...something
2017-01-22 13:11:02	Yoshi2	oh this time it is cmpw
2017-01-22 13:11:09	Yoshi2	compare word, compare word immediate
2017-01-22 13:11:27	Marty2000	Hi Espyo, Testyo and Yoshi2
2017-01-22 13:11:28	Testyo	and the first game to truly immerse me was getting when it came out?
2017-01-22 13:12:39	Yoshi2	ok cmpw r28 r23, r28 holds 1, r23 holds 1, CR0 holds value 0x2 which is 0b0010
2017-01-22 13:12:51	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-22 13:12:51	Yoshi2	bit 2 is set when both values are exact
2017-01-22 13:13:05	Yoshi2	ok this makes sense
2017-01-22 13:14:31	Yoshi2	then there is a blt instruction and that is something with branching
2017-01-22 13:15:15	Yoshi2	branch if less than, mhm
2017-01-22 13:15:40	Yoshi2	ok it didn't branch which makes sense
2017-01-22 13:28:13	Marty2000	2017-01-20 19:12:13	Yoshi2	day count in pikmin 2 is definitely unsigned 2017-01-20 19:13:01	Yoshi2	so that's a bit over 4 billion days you have to go through if you want to overflow the day count
2017-01-22 13:28:17	Marty2000	4 billion days...
2017-01-22 13:28:21	Marty2000	Rip :P
2017-01-22 13:28:29	Yoshi2	get to it marty!
2017-01-22 13:29:42	Marty2000	In almost 8 years, I'm only on day 644. So... at this rate, I might not be able to reach 4 billion days, ha ha
2017-01-22 13:39:41	Yoshi2	I wonder how many days you could do per day if you made an automatic macro for dolphin
2017-01-22 13:41:22	Yoshi2	and why does the game multiply the BMS command with 12
2017-01-22 13:48:12	Marty2000	I wonder if the 0/1 thing on seesaw blocks happens when a leader stands on a non-compressed paper bag (it doesn't on a compressed one though, but a Pikmin's weight isn't shown either in that case)
2017-01-22 13:51:17	Marty2000	If I want to try that, I can get out of bounds using a Creeping Chrysanthemum to enter the White Flower Garden without compressing the bag, then I can retrieve the Napsack and use it to get out of bounds somewhere else and eventually walk on top of the bag
2017-01-22 13:51:40	Marty2000	Seems feasible
2017-01-22 13:52:45	Marty2000	Of course, I need to restart a file, and go through day 1 again :(
2017-01-22 13:55:15	@Espyo	no need, I can test with moon jump on day 1
2017-01-22 13:55:53	@Espyo	hah!
2017-01-22 13:55:54	@Espyo	it does
2017-01-22 13:55:58	@Espyo	 0/15
2017-01-22 13:56:38	Marty2000	Thanks for trying
2017-01-22 13:56:43	Marty2000	0/15? Nice
2017-01-22 13:57:06	Marty2000	Ah, yeah, you need 15 Pikmin to crush the bag
2017-01-22 13:57:12	Marty2000	Great!
2017-01-22 13:57:23	@Espyo	I'll upload it

2017-01-22 13:57:38	Marty2000	Okay ;)
2017-01-22 13:58:35	Yoshi2	i should make a notepad file for this

2017-01-22 14:11:20	Yoshi2	loads 12 bytes from a place in ram
2017-01-22 14:12:53	Yoshi2	ok i guess it is a function that takes a pointer as an argument
2017-01-22 14:18:42	Yoshi2	it compares the values to 0
2017-01-22 14:20:50	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/d/dc/YellowPikminDataFile4.jpg Sometimes, I want to contact Nintendo and tell them "Yellow Pikmin may be good at digging, but Rocks are even better" http://www.pikminwiki.com/Tunnel#Digging_speeds It's like they don't want us to discover the truth :P
2017-01-22 14:22:27	Marty2000	Note how on the image, the Rock Pikmin seems to struggle at digging, while it's doing so as fast as the Yellow Pikmin...

2017-01-22 14:34:34	@Espyo	hehehe
2017-01-22 14:37:08	Yoshi2	ha this is neat, it checks if any of those three values are not equal to 0 and returns 1 in that case
2017-01-22 14:37:21	Yoshi2	if all are 0 then it returns 0
2017-01-22 14:39:11	@Espyo	huh, neat
2017-01-22 14:42:41	Yoshi2	actually i am tired of stepping through this code
2017-01-22 14:45:30	@Espyo	I bet
2017-01-22 14:45:37	@Espyo	you must've clicked "step next" thousands of times so far
2017-01-22 14:55:32	Marty2000	Yoshi2: http://www.infoplease.com/askeds/counting-billion.html Going as fast as possible, I need 32 seconds to select an area, end the day, read the mail and save. So I need 32 seconds to skip a day. .-.
2017-01-22 14:56:00	@Espyo	not too bad
2017-01-22 14:56:06	@Espyo	until you have to reach 4 billion
2017-01-22 14:56:43	Marty2000	Yeah. I must remind my descendants of Pikipedia though ;)
2017-01-22 14:56:50	@Espyo	hehe
2017-01-22 15:02:15	Yoshi2	ok assuming it took you one second per day
2017-01-22 15:02:27	Yoshi2	it will only take you 136 years
2017-01-22 15:05:15	Yoshi2	but it doesn't take you one second per day so
2017-01-22 15:05:29	Yoshi2	we can expect around a millenia or two at least
2017-01-22 15:06:12	Marty2000	Lol
2017-01-22 15:17:19	Marty2000	Anyway, if I can already reach 1000 days by the end of the month, I'll be satisfied. Just want to see what it looks like :P
2017-01-22 15:18:08	Marty2000	Then, the rest doesn't really matter
2017-01-22 15:48:58	Yoshi2	heh, go for it
2017-01-22 15:51:15	Marty2000	Right now, I'm skipping days while doing something else :P
2017-01-22 15:58:59	Yoshi2	ok I basically think each time this memory break triggers I will be reading either a BMS command or one of the BMS command's arguments
2017-01-22 15:59:46	@Espyo	fingers crossed
2017-01-22 16:02:39	Yoshi2	so basically
2017-01-22 16:02:59	Yoshi2	i can keep resuming, it will break at a spot and I can write the command down
2017-01-22 16:20:31	Marty2000	I've reached day 800 so far, not too bad I suppose
2017-01-22 16:53:05	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Pikmin 3 by Tricky Berry (-415 /* Gameplay */ What the hell? Water has NEVER been knee-height. It has always fu...) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=1346&diff=170781
2017-01-22 17:43:15	Yoshi2	Espyo: ^ that is actually a good point, pikmin 2 definitely had some underwater sections
2017-01-22 17:44:14	@Espyo	never deeper than eye-height
2017-01-22 17:44:23	@Espyo	it's not knee-height, no, but it's certainly not deep at all
2017-01-22 17:44:29	@Espyo	it's deep enough to drown Pikmin, but not any deeper
2017-01-22 17:44:41	@Espyo	P3 however is deep enough for Blue Pikmin swimming to be a thing
2017-01-22 17:46:36	Yoshi2	huh
2017-01-22 17:48:05	Marty2000	Wait, there is a cave in P2 where the water can be as deep as in P3
2017-01-22 17:48:11	Marty2000	or not far off
2017-01-22 17:48:31	@Espyo	the one with the stump?
2017-01-22 17:48:48	Marty2000	This one
2017-01-22 17:48:51	Marty2000	Yes
2017-01-22 17:49:04	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-22 17:49:11	@Espyo	I can barely remember
2017-01-22 17:49:15	Marty2000	Well, the image we have on the wiki doesn't show it though...
2017-01-22 17:49:34	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/3/3d/Hole_of_Heroes_sublevel_6.jpg Yeah, it doesn't show where the deep water is
2017-01-22 17:49:40	Marty2000	Maybe a video on Youtube...?
2017-01-22 17:50:20	@Espyo	I believe you, though
2017-01-22 17:50:30	@Espyo	still, I think the fact that Blues can swim is at least a bit noteworthy
2017-01-22 17:50:36	@Espyo	water is no longer just a "state" of some place
2017-01-22 17:50:40	@Espyo	it's actually a thing now
2017-01-22 17:50:46	@Espyo	with depth, ripples, motion, etc.
2017-01-22 17:50:55	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/N8yztP5.png this is not very deep but definitely deeper than olimar's eye height
2017-01-22 17:50:58	Marty2000	That is true, yeah
2017-01-22 17:51:13	@Espyo	the antenna pokes out :P
2017-01-22 17:51:42	Marty2000	Guess I'll have to use Dolphin, then
2017-01-22 17:51:45	Yoshi2	still "where water was at about knee height for the leaders," is pretty wrong because water could be deeper than that
2017-01-22 17:51:54	@Espyo	true
2017-01-22 17:54:31	Yoshi2	I'll check free cam for this
2017-01-22 17:55:49	<--	Claris (Claris@387-839-848-455.res.bhn.net) has quit
2017-01-22 17:56:57	Yoshi2	it just about submerges the antenna
2017-01-22 17:57:32	Yoshi2	at least
2017-01-22 17:58:35	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/TmsW7Xz.png hard to tell for sure because of the weird behavior of the graphics when using free cam
2017-01-22 17:58:43	@Espyo	aaaah
2017-01-22 17:59:51	Yoshi2	oh got it
2017-01-22 18:00:02	Yoshi2	I can rotate the camera too and even move it below the water
2017-01-22 18:00:43	Marty2000	Espyo and Yoshi2: http://imgur.com/KoHLTSu    http://imgur.com/DIWdzhC
2017-01-22 18:01:11	Yoshi2	http://i.imgur.com/VxQ0F68.png submerged and a bit more (this is in valley of respose)
2017-01-22 18:01:11	@Espyo	yeah, that's pretty deep
2017-01-22 18:01:16	@Espyo	still not as deep as P3, but
2017-01-22 18:04:15	Yoshi2	deep enough to make the claim incorrect
2017-01-22 18:10:30	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-22 18:32:47	Marty2000	" if I can already reach 1000 days by the end of the month" Should have said "by the end of the day"
2017-01-22 18:32:50	Marty2000	:P
2017-01-22 18:33:07	Marty2000	Actually not that boring when doing other stuff at the same time
2017-01-22 19:17:53	Yoshi2	i am not breathing BMS as much as I used to
2017-01-22 19:23:44	Yoshi2	ok hmmm
2017-01-22 19:26:05	Yoshi2	ok 0xDF is a valid BMS command apparently
2017-01-22 19:26:53	@Espyo	progress!
2017-01-22 19:30:17	Yoshi2	oh I actually identified 0xDF correctly once in pikmin 1
2017-01-22 19:30:22	Yoshi2	4 bytes of data after it
2017-01-22 19:32:04	Yoshi2	C8 05 00 00 00 did literally nothing what
2017-01-22 19:32:15	Yoshi2	C8 usually jumps but hmm
2017-01-22 19:41:09	Yoshi2	I was about to say "wow I identified the CF command correctly!" and then the pointer jumps forward far more than what I expected
2017-01-22 19:42:19	Yoshi2	but not as much as what I would expect under regular circumstances
2017-01-22 19:50:32	Yoshi2	WHAT THE HECK IS THIS MADNESS
2017-01-22 19:56:40	Marty2000	Day 1000 is shown as Day 000 on the area selection screen
2017-01-22 19:57:16	Marty2000	in-game, it's day 1000
2017-01-22 19:57:44	@Espyo	haha
2017-01-22 19:57:49	@Espyo	oh, wow
2017-01-22 19:57:54	@Espyo	Marty2000: please add that to the wiki
2017-01-22 19:58:52	Yoshi2	:L
2017-01-22 19:59:14	Yoshi2	I made similar discoveries when I was messing with day values
2017-01-22 19:59:30	Yoshi2	area selection screen and letter screen both only show the first 3 digits
2017-01-22 19:59:49	Yoshi2	the ingame counter tries to squish the entire number into the bubble
2017-01-22 19:59:54	Marty2000	Yeah
2017-01-22 20:00:34	Yoshi2	file select also tries to squish the number into the bubble but I forgot to what extent
2017-01-22 20:00:36	Marty2000	Espyo: where? [[Day]]?
2017-01-22 20:00:37	Testyo	"Day" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Day
2017-01-22 20:01:53	@Espyo	good question...
2017-01-22 20:02:05	@Espyo	I guess the problem befalls on the area selection menu, so [[Menu#Area selection]]
2017-01-22 20:02:05	Testyo	"Menu#Area_selection" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Menu#Area_selection
2017-01-22 20:02:08	Yoshi2	10/10 planning
2017-01-22 20:15:24	Marty2000	... I need to get my recorder repaired, it can't record anymore
2017-01-22 20:17:58	Marty2000	Espyo, do you have NPC!P2 (European version) working on Dolphin?
2017-01-22 20:18:23	Marty2000	If so, then I can give you my save so you can take the screenshot with a higher quality if you like
2017-01-22 20:20:48	@Espyo	I do
2017-01-22 20:20:53	@Espyo	ah, sure
2017-01-22 20:21:00	@Espyo	although I can just edit the number of days with cheats
2017-01-22 20:21:13	@Espyo	now that me and Yoshi2 found out how to find the address
2017-01-22 20:21:19	@Espyo	I'll add it to my todo and do it tomorrow
2017-01-22 20:21:43	Yoshi2	what's your todo for today
2017-01-22 20:21:58	Marty2000	Oh, okay
2017-01-22 20:23:00	@Espyo	continue playing Xenoblade
2017-01-22 20:23:12	@Espyo	and after dinner, play Mario Kart 8 with friends
2017-01-22 20:23:26	Yoshi2	wow
2017-01-22 20:23:27	@Espyo	I'm on this cozy couch, and all stretched up to type this
2017-01-22 20:23:36	Yoshi2	marty how do you feel about espyo slacking off like that
2017-01-22 20:23:38	@Espyo	so messing about with cheat codes isn't the most comfortable thing
2017-01-22 20:23:43	@Espyo	EXCUSE ME?
2017-01-22 20:23:48	@Espyo	I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW XENOBLADE IS IMPORTANT
2017-01-22 20:24:03	@Espyo	tell him, Testyo
2017-01-22 20:24:03	Testyo	I think that icon was a bit temporary
2017-01-22 20:24:11	@Espyo	no, not the icon, the game itself, Testyo
2017-01-22 20:24:12	Testyo	okay, so in Portuguese, we don't have a theory that can be mysteries
2017-01-22 20:24:16	@Espyo	... :|
2017-01-22 20:24:23	@Espyo	he really likes made-up Portuguese facts

2017-01-22 20:44:53	@Espyo	i-it probably already exists on wikia

2017-01-23 18:51:16	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-01-23 18:51:16	Testyo	I DIDN'T WANNA ASK people who like jrpgs and cute animu girls for obvious reasons)
2017-01-23 18:51:31	Yoshi2	ಠ_ಠ 
2017-01-23 18:52:05	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-23 18:52:08	@Espyo	wow, weaboo shaming, Testyo
2017-01-23 18:52:08	Testyo	And when they finally re-released it, it still was nowhere near me
2017-01-23 19:00:27	Yoshi2	pointers are fun
2017-01-23 19:00:46	Yoshi2	this assembler code has pointers up your butt
2017-01-23 19:01:54	@Espyo	brilliant
2017-01-23 19:26:09	Yoshi2	oh I stepped through this enough times that I'm now in the next cycle of this bms parser reading the next command
2017-01-23 19:26:26	@Espyo	at least you know where you are pretty well
2017-01-23 19:31:47	Yoshi2	"Anyone have the Bw1 attack command sound effect?" IS IT TIME FOR ME TO STEP IN
2017-01-23 19:32:35	Yoshi2	i am the master of files
2017-01-23 19:32:47	Yoshi2	but where the heck did i put the sound files i uploaded a while ago
2017-01-23 19:33:18	@Espyo	yeee
2017-01-23 19:34:59	Yoshi2	inb4 i have to download my own upload to get the file
2017-01-23 19:37:34	Yoshi2	that seems to be the case
2017-01-23 19:37:37	Yoshi2	oh well
2017-01-23 19:48:48	Yoshi2	found the sound I needed, yay
2017-01-23 19:51:15	@Espyo	and now don't misplace it
2017-01-23 19:59:50	Yoshi2	i will now praise the gods for making a program like ffmpeg exist
2017-01-23 20:02:35	@Espyo	hehe
2017-01-23 20:05:00	Yoshi2	fun fact
2017-01-23 20:05:08	Yoshi2	the bms parser splits commands into families
2017-01-23 20:05:21	Yoshi2	e.g. there is the 0xA0 family which includes stuff from 0xA0 to 0xAF
2017-01-23 20:07:43	@Espyo	that sounds...pointless
2017-01-23 20:08:54	Yoshi2	I am not sure how it looked before compilation, but right now the code is like
2017-01-23 20:10:34	Yoshi2	is command >= 0x80? If no, continue (haven't checked this branch out yet). If yes, jump and next check
2017-01-23 20:11:44	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-01-23 20:11:52	@Espyo	not sure why they didn't just go with a damn switch case
2017-01-23 20:12:36	Yoshi2	next check: is it exactly 0x80? if yes, continue (again, haven't checked this branch). If not, jump and next check, etc etc etc
2017-01-23 20:12:51	@Espyo	good code, 10/10
2017-01-23 20:13:08	Yoshi2	it's more genius than you might think from what I write
2017-01-23 20:13:33	Yoshi2	0 to 0x7F are note commands, 0x80 is a delay I think
2017-01-23 20:13:34	Testyo	7 F = -13.8889 °C / 259.261 K
2017-01-23 20:14:01	@Espyo	oh, in that case, that's fine
2017-01-23 20:14:06	@Espyo	yeah, it's a bit hard to grasp
2017-01-23 20:14:16	@Espyo	hey, wasn't there a beautifier?
2017-01-23 20:14:21	@Espyo	I think we tried searching for one ages ago
2017-01-23 20:14:25	@Espyo	but I can't remember the conclusion
2017-01-23 20:14:33	Yoshi2	a beautifier
2017-01-23 20:15:02	@Espyo	reading "a += 1" has to be easier than "addw $03456A 1"
2017-01-23 20:15:02	Testyo	$ 03456 = 3178.48 € / £ 2246.05

2017-01-23 21:23:05	Yoshi2	I skipped over a bunch of stuff
2017-01-23 21:25:27	Yoshi2	there was a function thing but I couldn't nail down the exact spot in which it reads arguments

2017-01-25 19:17:13	Testyo	the install disc is 8 gb, and I got 9 gb of free space so if there is heavy compression it might be more than that the game is pausing whenever you are switching items/doing whatever, whereas in Dark Souls, the game world is always running. You can die in menus
2017-01-25 19:17:23	Marty2000	Hello Espyo and Testyo

2017-01-25 20:04:21	@Espyo	oh yeah, almost forgot about mine
2017-01-25 20:04:25	@Espyo	you know, I'm pretty hyped and all
2017-01-25 20:04:29	@Espyo	but then a realization came to me
2017-01-25 20:04:32	@Espyo	what if this game is always online?
2017-01-25 20:04:35	@Espyo	my heart sank at the thought
2017-01-25 20:04:46	@Espyo	I plan on playing this at the bus, and, if cramped, the subway
2017-01-25 20:04:52	@Espyo	(if not cramped, I just play 3DS)
2017-01-25 20:04:58	@Espyo	but if it's always online, bollocks to that plan
2017-01-25 20:05:36	Yoshi2	mhm
2017-01-25 20:05:50	Yoshi2	it might have to be always online to prevent cheating
2017-01-25 20:07:09	Yoshi2	why the heck is blazing swords so full of cute looking characters
2017-01-25 20:07:48	@Espyo	and Awakening
2017-01-25 20:07:56	@Espyo	these portraits are much higher quality than in-game
2017-01-25 20:08:02	@Espyo	makes Morgan, your lovely daughter, look so much more lovely
2017-01-25 20:12:48	Yoshi2	mhm, that will probably my next pick

2017-01-25 20:20:47	@Espyo	it says my day 7 is coming soon
2017-01-25 20:20:50	@Espyo	eh, timezones, I guess
2017-01-25 20:20:55	@Espyo	but that doesn't even make any sense...
2017-01-25 20:21:04	Yoshi2	maybe you missed a day
2017-01-25 20:21:14	Yoshi2	a new day starts at 5:00 UTC
2017-01-25 20:21:15	Testyo	00 UTC = 2 CET / 19 EST
2017-01-25 20:21:39	@Espyo	I was pretty sure I went more than 24 hours without voting at one point
2017-01-25 20:21:47	@Espyo	but it should show that I missed the day or something...
2017-01-25 20:21:51	@Espyo	also, voting for Nowi twice?
2017-01-25 20:21:56	@Espyo	shame on you, other characters need love too

2017-01-25 20:23:22	Yoshi2	I know I got up to mission 20 or something once before I lost my save
2017-01-25 20:24:48	@Espyo	aww
2017-01-25 20:24:57	@Espyo	well, but by then, you already meet all of them
2017-01-25 20:24:59	@Espyo	there's 21 chapters
2017-01-25 20:25:09	@Espyo	you get the last two in chapter 20, and even then, you already see them in previous chapters
2017-01-25 20:25:32	Yoshi2	i already forgot what the story was in the later chapters
2017-01-25 20:25:46	Yoshi2	shame on me
2017-01-25 20:25:58	@Espyo	eh, the purists say Awakening's story is kinda forgettable

2017-01-25 21:26:27	Yoshi2	ok this one instruction is weird

2017-01-25 21:28:49	@Espyo	ok, hold up a bit
2017-01-25 21:28:59	@Espyo	there's a processor instruction that does SPECIFICALLY THAT?
2017-01-25 21:29:03	@Espyo	or are you talking about a function?

2017-01-25 21:40:32	@Espyo	oh, the values are given by the code
2017-01-25 21:40:43	@Espyo	I thought that specifically 29 positions and specifically 0x8 was part of the instruction
2017-01-25 21:42:46	Yoshi2	heh, no
2017-01-25 21:42:50	Yoshi2	that would be a waste of space

2017-01-26 22:19:40	@Espyo	pretty great
2017-01-26 22:19:42	Yoshi2	pretty alright besides having to do some homework
2017-01-26 22:19:46	@Espyo	though I'm a bit weirded out by Inkscape
2017-01-26 22:19:52	@Espyo	I updated it, and now it ruined some measurements
2017-01-26 22:20:00	@Espyo	it thinks 1 pixel is 1.127 pixels or something
2017-01-26 22:20:15	@Espyo	how are you doing, WikiGuest35?
2017-01-26 22:20:35	WikiGuest35	thats weird. I am trying to get used to gimp instead of inkscape because inkscape doesn't like my mac. :\
2017-01-26 22:20:42	WikiGuest35	I am good. Sitting at work doing nothing
2017-01-26 22:20:43	@Espyo	ouch

2017-01-26 22:21:29	WikiGuest35	will do!
2017-01-26 22:21:45	WikiGuest35	I like it better so far but it's hard to get used to compared to inkscape
2017-01-26 22:21:51	WikiGuest35	I mainly use to for logo design
2017-01-26 22:22:39	@Espyo	I just use both, since they serve different purposes for me
2017-01-26 22:22:46	@Espyo	GIMP really is photo editing, Inkscape to make icons and such
2017-01-26 22:22:47	WikiGuest35	gotcha. what do you use them for?
2017-01-26 22:22:53	WikiGuest35	ah! gotcha

2017-01-26 22:42:14	WeatherGeek96	the problem is I don't play much pikmin.
2017-01-26 22:42:25	@Espyo	we have a few tasks that don't need Pikmin knowledge
2017-01-26 22:42:25	WeatherGeek96	I really like it. I just haven't bought and played through any
2017-01-26 22:42:32	@Espyo	that's fair
2017-01-26 22:42:35	WeatherGeek96	okay like what?

2017-01-26 22:42:51	@Espyo	or you can just play with Testyo, that's also a thing
2017-01-26 22:42:51	Testyo	he's the type of guy that has a lot of stuff happening today
2017-01-26 22:43:05	@Espyo	...Testyo, WeatherGeek96 specifically said that that's not true, are you stoned?
2017-01-26 22:43:05	Testyo	So maybe I could look through that as well and make a more general video about it wants
2017-01-26 22:43:09	@Espyo	:|
2017-01-26 22:43:11	WeatherGeek96	I am a web designer/programmer so  yeah.
2017-01-26 22:43:18	@Espyo	nice
2017-01-26 22:43:32	@Espyo	dunno what is it about this IRC that attracts so many programmers lol
2017-01-26 22:43:36	@Espyo	me, you, Yoshi2, J
2017-01-26 22:43:45	WeatherGeek96	well part time doing that. so yay
2017-01-26 22:43:55	@Espyo	still counts in my book
2017-01-26 22:44:00	WeatherGeek96	hahaha! that do you guys program?
2017-01-26 22:44:07	@Espyo	I specialize in C++
2017-01-26 22:44:12	@Espyo	J and Yoshi2, in Python
2017-01-26 22:44:15	WeatherGeek96	Dude thats awesome
2017-01-26 22:44:18	@Espyo	thanks!
2017-01-26 22:44:31	@Espyo	so I reckon you mostly mess about with JS?
2017-01-26 22:45:12	WeatherGeek96	I have dabbled in python. I am proficient in HTML and CSS. I dabble in JS, and PHP. So I can find my way around those two but I am not what I would consider proficient. 
2017-01-26 22:45:25	@Espyo	nice
2017-01-26 22:45:35	@Espyo	heh, don't know if anybody in the world is really proficient at JS
2017-01-26 22:45:40	@Espyo	good, sure, but proficient?
2017-01-26 22:45:52	WeatherGeek96	true
2017-01-26 22:46:03	@Espyo	ever since I learned that my_array.length can return different things depending on Firefox, Chrome, or IE, I just gave up on ever trying to understand JS
2017-01-26 22:46:24	@Espyo	IIRC, if you've got like:
2017-01-26 22:46:28	@Espyo	var myarray = [];

2017-01-26 22:46:43	@Espyo	alert(myarray.length)
2017-01-26 22:46:49	@Espyo	you get 4 in Chrome, and 1 in Firefox
2017-01-26 22:46:54	WeatherGeek96	hahahah! yeah I am not even that good at it.  
2017-01-26 22:47:01	WeatherGeek96	I did not know that. That is rediculous
2017-01-26 22:47:23	WeatherGeek96	I can follow along in JS and PHP but straight coding from scratch I cannot do in JS
2017-01-26 22:47:40	@Espyo	JS is simple, but when it comes with stuff like that, it's such a pain...
2017-01-26 22:48:30	Yoshi2	I've done a bit of stuff with C and am currently trying to make sense of assembler code for pikmin stuff i need to find out

2017-01-26 22:49:17	WeatherGeek96	yeah. I starting learning C# but I didn't get far into it

2017-01-26 22:49:35	WeatherGeek96	You cool doods!

2017-01-26 23:30:50	@Espyo	but I bet it's still as janky and nonsense
2017-01-26 23:31:02	@Espyo	at work, the bingo game engine runs in C++, but scripting for each game is done in JS
2017-01-26 23:31:09	@Espyo	debugging it is like taking your eyes out with a spork
2017-01-26 23:39:52	Yoshi2|offline	oh before i poof to bed, here is some madness: https://i.imgur.com/OjQn5uZ.png
2017-01-26 23:40:12	Yoshi2|offline	approximating the differential of a function at a specific spot for different values of h
2017-01-26 23:40:42	Yoshi2|offline	and plotting the relative error compared to the real differential
2017-01-26 23:41:11	Yoshi2|offline	and basically you have to look at it from right to left
2017-01-26 23:42:37	Yoshi2|offline	and as you choose smaller values of h the relative error becomes smaller for a bit, then it becomes REALLY small and then it goes up before it buggers off into space
2017-01-26 23:44:19	Yoshi2|offline	a relative error of 10^-10 means the error between my approximation and the real value is 10^-10 percent of the real value or something
2017-01-26 23:45:01	Yoshi2|offline	s/percent of/times the real value
2017-01-26 23:45:30	Yoshi2|offline	10^0 means the error is 1 time the real value, 10^8 means the error is a truckload times the real value
2017-01-26 23:46:46	@Espyo	I think I'm too tired to understand this
2017-01-26 23:46:54	@Espyo	but I'll try tomorrow
2017-01-26 23:46:55	@Espyo	night
2017-01-26 23:47:42	Yoshi2|offline	i still have more of this to do you have no excuse :(

2017-01-27 22:02:42	@J	oh, all the JS I do is server-side, so there's only one configuration, and no DOM
2017-01-27 22:07:48	Yoshi2	Espyo: I recently took a look at http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Assembler_Tutorial#Application_Binary_Interface_.28SVR4_ABI.29 and this madness actually makes sense
2017-01-27 22:10:05	Yoshi2	I've seen some recurring themes in the code
2017-01-27 22:13:23	@Espyo	ah
2017-01-27 22:13:31	@Espyo	oh, sweet
2017-01-27 22:15:01	@Espyo	ah, so I guess you didn't know that that's how functions are in assembly?
2017-01-27 22:15:02	@Espyo	(more or less)
2017-01-27 22:36:37	Yoshi2	Espyo: I didn't know there was a more or less standardized way to do functions
2017-01-27 22:36:48	@Espyo	well...
2017-01-27 22:36:55	@Espyo	it's not quite that there's a standard
2017-01-27 22:36:55	Yoshi2	does make sense though
2017-01-27 22:36:57	@Espyo	it's like
2017-01-27 22:36:58	@Espyo	I mean
2017-01-27 22:37:06	@Espyo	when you write high level code
2017-01-27 22:37:10	@Espyo	that's what the functions get translated to :|
2017-01-27 22:37:16	@Espyo	look, I don't mean to undermine you
2017-01-27 22:37:21	@Espyo	not like I know the details either
2017-01-27 22:37:31	@Espyo	but it's one of the very few things I remember from my assembly classes
2017-01-27 22:37:36	@Espyo	functions work like that
2017-01-27 22:37:37	@Espyo	it's so cool
2017-01-27 22:37:43	@Espyo	but knowing this makes you oh so aware of the overhead
2017-01-27 22:38:00	@Espyo	like, when you're making a game, and you've got 100+ objects check for collision with 100+ objects
2017-01-27 22:38:18	@Espyo	the difference between having a check_collision() function and just doing the collision code inside the loops becomes real
2017-01-27 22:38:23	@Espyo	heck, it happened on the engine
2017-01-27 22:38:32	@Espyo	a lot of my "all mobs vs all mobs" code is just one massive block because of this
2017-01-27 22:38:58	@Espyo	it's really jarring, but once you learn just what the processor instructions do whenever you call a function, everything just clicks and your mind blows at how obvious it is that there's such a large overhead
2017-01-27 22:39:57	Yoshi2	I always knew there was a thing called a stack but this way I'm really seeing what goes into that stack
2017-01-27 22:40:40	Yoshi2	obviously there are variables and stuff, but registers have to be backed up too
2017-01-27 22:40:44	@Espyo	yeah

2017-01-28 16:45:21	@Espyo	probably already late

2017-01-28 16:55:40	Yoshi2	only issue is if they suddenly announce pikmin 4 at E3

2017-01-28 16:57:32	@Espyo	yep
2017-01-28 16:57:37	@Espyo	though the poll only lasts 2 months
2017-01-28 16:57:42	@Espyo	E3 won't start before then
2017-01-28 16:58:42	Yoshi2	two months?
2017-01-28 16:59:02	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-28 16:59:20	@Espyo	E3's normally like April, right?
2017-01-28 17:00:12	Yoshi2	june even

2017-01-29 13:18:33	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2017-01-29 13:18:34	Testyo	*** Looking up your game to access the level select in Sonic 3D
2017-01-29 13:18:51	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-29 13:28:40	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-01-29 13:28:41	Testyo	the longer hes around the more he fucks you get one of these wrong
2017-01-29 13:28:58	Yoshi2	 ಠ_ಠ 
2017-01-29 13:31:17	@Espyo	hi
2017-01-29 13:35:32	Yoshi2	I wonder
2017-01-29 13:35:41	Yoshi2	should I start making C code out of this assembler code
2017-01-29 13:35:47	Yoshi2	or should I continue making sense of it
2017-01-29 13:40:23	@Espyo	that's what I meant by using a beautifier
2017-01-29 13:40:35	@Espyo	either make it pretty on your own, or with some tool
2017-01-29 13:40:38	@Espyo	you can't  go on like this
2017-01-29 13:44:07	Yoshi2	find me a powerpc beautifier and I'll use it :]
2017-01-29 13:44:28	@Espyo	write your own
2017-01-29 13:44:33	Yoshi2	writing a beautifier myself would be a lot of effort while still not being THAT useful
2017-01-29 13:44:38	@Espyo	how many instructions could there possibly be?
2017-01-29 13:44:39	@Espyo	 50?
2017-01-29 13:44:54	@Espyo	you sure?
2017-01-29 13:45:03	@Espyo	I mean, in my head, it sounds like you can get SOMETHING all right fairly easily
2017-01-29 13:48:34	Yoshi2	I could write something that translates the disassembled stuff into something else but for the most part that will be little more than making the not verbose commands more verbose
2017-01-29 13:51:17	Yoshi2	and the function of the code will still be unknown unless I read through it
2017-01-29 13:51:48	Yoshi2	so I might as well work with the non-beautified assembler code directly
2017-01-29 13:51:59	Yoshi2	while having the docs open
2017-01-29 13:58:31	Yoshi2	what I meant by making C code out of it is for keeping track of what I think the code might be like if it was written in proper C
2017-01-29 13:59:05	Yoshi2	not simply making each line of assembler into something C-like
2017-01-29 13:59:17	Yoshi2	so I could insert stuff like if statements and loops
2017-01-29 14:02:35	Yoshi2	which a beautifier wouldn't do
2017-01-29 14:21:42	@Espyo	well, that's fair
2017-01-29 14:21:50	@Espyo	but I can imagine it being at least slightly easier to understand
2017-01-29 14:32:25	Yoshi2	it's still effort
2017-01-29 14:33:02	Yoshi2	plus it is easier to work directly with dolphin because dolphin has the code stepping and the registers
2017-01-29 14:33:19	Yoshi2	and dolphin won't have the beautified code
2017-01-29 14:35:48	@Espyo	oh, you're right
2017-01-29 14:35:52	@Espyo	didn't even thought about that
2017-01-29 14:35:59	@Espyo	I guess, for reading standalone code, I'd prefer it beautified
2017-01-29 14:36:04	@Espyo	but for stepping through, of course that's not a thing
2017-01-29 14:36:08	@Espyo	all right, that's fair
2017-01-29 16:28:03	Yoshi2	why is "load 0x8048 into the higher 16 bits of register r3" such a common instruction? o.o
2017-01-29 16:29:06	@Espyo	very good question
2017-01-29 16:29:10	@Espyo	what's the binary for 0x8048?
2017-01-29 16:33:43	Yoshi2	0b1000000001001000
2017-01-29 16:33:53	Yoshi2	32840 in decimal
2017-01-29 16:39:01	@Espyo	wot
2017-01-29 16:39:15	@Espyo	"b" isn't binary
2017-01-29 16:39:22	@Espyo	what is this farce, Yoshi2?!
2017-01-29 16:40:18	Yoshi2	0b1111 = 1111 in binary, 0x1111 = 1111 in hexadecimal
2017-01-29 16:40:49	Yoshi2	0b is a prefix for binary numbers in python
2017-01-29 16:42:02	@Espyo	aaaaahhh
2017-01-29 16:42:06	@Espyo	ok, well, in that case
2017-01-29 16:42:15	@Espyo	that 0x8048 is only three bits set to 1
2017-01-29 16:42:24	@Espyo	so those three in particular have to be important
2017-01-29 16:42:38	@Espyo	if it were like 7 "1"s and 9 "0"s, that'd be pretty nonsense
2017-01-29 16:42:47	@Espyo	but since it's only 3, I guess it makes a bit more sense that it's such a common function
2017-01-29 16:43:53	Yoshi2	now it is subtracting 26880 from 0x8048
2017-01-29 16:47:02	Yoshi2	26880 is 0x6900
2017-01-29 16:47:05	Yoshi2	OH THE JOKERS
2017-01-29 16:47:33	Yoshi2	final result is 0x80479700
2017-01-29 16:48:16	@Espyo	hmm? meaning what?
2017-01-29 16:55:11	Yoshi2	beats me
2017-01-29 16:56:36	Yoshi2	it's not code
2017-01-29 16:57:53	Yoshi2	could be data
2017-01-29 17:01:14	Yoshi2	ok this is kind of spooky
2017-01-29 17:02:32	Yoshi2	this command is like B1 C1 40 blabla
2017-01-29 17:02:49	Yoshi2	and the C1 is rotated 2 bits to the left
2017-01-29 17:03:20	Yoshi2	which in this case is basically multiplying with 4
2017-01-29 17:03:57	Yoshi2	and then
2017-01-29 17:04:08	Yoshi2	the address from before and this new value is added together
2017-01-29 17:04:15	Yoshi2	and then the game loads something from this
2017-01-29 17:04:32	Yoshi2	c1 multiplied by 4 is 0x304
2017-01-29 17:04:48	Yoshi2	it loads from r3 offset by -0x300
2017-01-29 17:04:54	Yoshi2	that IS NOT A COINCIDENCE

2017-01-30 22:10:18	@Espyo	that's gotta be worth something

2017-01-30 22:11:23	Yoshi2	turn based strategy isn't dead, that is sure
2017-01-30 22:13:03	Yoshi2	maybe advance wars needs to go back to being cute again

2017-01-30 22:26:23	Yoshi2	said 6 new messages but only 3 of them were new, the others were about you talking about fixing the script which I already read
2017-01-30 22:26:54	@Espyo	eep
2017-01-30 22:27:07	@Espyo	it was your message

2017-01-31 22:14:23	Yoshi2	I've recently played more of FE:A and I realized
2017-01-31 22:14:31	Yoshi2	I'm probably not 20 levels into the game
2017-01-31 22:14:58	Yoshi2	it was 11 chapters and I didn't get further than that probably
2017-01-31 22:15:28	Yoshi2	I made progress and got up to 16 or so
2017-01-31 22:17:06	@Espyo	ouch, man
2017-01-31 22:24:30	Yoshi2	FE:A really is something else in difficulty compared to e.g. FE: shadow dragon on the DS
2017-01-31 22:26:05	@Espyo	what, it's easier?
2017-01-31 22:27:08	Yoshi2	shadow dragon is one of the more classic FE games
2017-01-31 22:27:36	@Espyo	so SD is harder, I reckon
2017-01-31 22:28:00	Yoshi2	no grinding outside of the story missions, no buying weapons outside of specific levels, no infinite money

2017-01-31 22:31:18	Neocraftz1553	Hey Yoshi2!
2017-01-31 22:31:24	@Espyo	normally, you clone it on github
2017-01-31 22:31:29	@Espyo	which requires you to have git installed
2017-01-31 22:31:34	@Espyo	but you can just get a zip file of it

2017-01-31 22:31:54	@Espyo	I've done something today

2017-01-31 23:49:42	Yoshi2	it almost could've worked in the sense of "If you could release Pikmin 4 on any platform you'd like, what would you choose?" 
2017-01-31 23:50:07	Yoshi2	no caring about technical difficulties, no "b-but BotW is the last wii u game!!!"
2017-01-31 23:52:28	@Espyo	yeah
2017-01-31 23:52:29	@Espyo	that'd work
2017-01-31 23:52:41	@Espyo	hmm
2017-01-31 23:52:46	@Espyo	hey, I actually can't see a problem with that
2017-01-31 23:52:48	@Espyo	it's too late now
2017-01-31 23:52:55	@Espyo	but you can try nominating that
2017-01-31 23:52:58	@Espyo	there's still time
2017-01-31 23:53:11	@Espyo	if we don't get a Direct in the next two months, it's safe to say that we'll only get new stuff at E3
2017-01-31 23:53:29	Yoshi2	mhm yes, a repacked platform poll
2017-01-31 23:53:44	@Espyo	hey, if it's a good idea...
2017-01-31 23:53:50	@Espyo	or you can add a comment to the existing one
2017-01-31 23:53:54	@Espyo	yeah, that's probably better
2017-01-31 23:54:13	@Espyo	if that poll becomes the next one, for April and May, there's still time before E3
2017-01-31 23:54:26	@Espyo	and even then, the question will hardly be affected by official revelations
2017-01-31 23:54:27	@Espyo	so go go go
2017-01-31 23:54:34	@Espyo	please write it on the nominations page before it's forgotten
2017-01-31 23:54:54	Yoshi2	do i remove my reject or leave it
2017-01-31 23:56:09	@Espyo	probably leave it
2017-01-31 23:56:16	@Espyo	it's still true that you rejected that version

2017-02-01 19:08:10	Testyo	Good evening everyone!
2017-02-01 19:13:25	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-02-01 19:13:26	Testyo	I haven't gotten hopping on
2017-02-01 19:34:43	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-01 19:47:27	Yoshi2	important question, do i do more BMS work or do I play more Fire Emblem
2017-02-01 19:51:57	@Espyo	is it Fire Emblem Heroes?
2017-02-01 19:53:01	Yoshi2	heroes isn't out yet but I will play that
2017-02-01 19:53:36	@Espyo	damn, I was hoping some countries would get it sooner
2017-02-01 19:53:41	@Espyo	the waiting is the hardest part
2017-02-01 19:53:47	@Espyo	but anyway, it it ain't Heroes, do BMS work
2017-02-01 19:54:10	Yoshi2	true
2017-02-01 19:54:22	Yoshi2	when heroes comes out I will dedicate my life to getting my waifu brigade
2017-02-01 19:56:18	Yoshi2	consisting of nino and eirika and lyn and shiida and nowi and tiki and some others and some husbandos will be there too
2017-02-01 19:59:19	@Espyo	I just need to spawn one Lucina
2017-02-01 19:59:28	@Espyo	and I'll trust that the rest of the characters that come along will be good enough
2017-02-01 20:02:29	Yoshi2	I'm not that thirsty for a female marth so I don't care much about Lucina :^)
2017-02-01 20:03:08	@Espyo	you can have your pantsuless units
2017-02-01 20:03:12	@Espyo	I just need one to be happy
2017-02-01 20:03:37	Yoshi2	fair point
2017-02-01 20:03:43	Yoshi2	may god bless you with good RNG
2017-02-01 20:03:59	@Espyo	you too
2017-02-01 20:04:08	@Espyo	what's the use, we know that won't happen any time soon ;~;
2017-02-01 20:05:30	@Espyo	r/fireemblem will be filled with posts of people getting their favorite units right as their first roll
2017-02-01 20:05:35	@Espyo	but that'll only be like 1% of the userbase
2017-02-01 20:05:44	Yoshi2	oh yes
2017-02-01 20:05:47	Yoshi2	i know that pain
2017-02-01 20:06:36	Yoshi2	you will get your favorite unit in less than 20 runs, or you never get it in 100s of runs
2017-02-01 20:09:33	Yoshi2	in kancolle I was on the lucky end of the spectrum, having received a very much sought-after German submarine https://i.imgur.com/z8gyUYD.png

2017-02-01 20:10:07	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-01 20:10:18	@Espyo	sick
2017-02-01 20:10:24	Yoshi2	but FE will double the randomness
2017-02-01 20:10:37	Yoshi2	because you are not only rolling for your waifu but also for a rank
2017-02-01 20:11:20	Yoshi2	though I think you can do something to increase the rank. I forgot what it was
2017-02-01 20:11:32	@Espyo	I think you just practice
2017-02-01 20:11:37	@Espyo	rank is just basically how good your unit is
2017-02-01 20:11:40	@Espyo	which you can grind for
2017-02-01 20:11:47	@Espyo	I THINK
2017-02-01 20:12:55	Yoshi2	hmmmmm
2017-02-01 20:28:18	Yoshi2	rip bms work, I've been sidetracked looking for a specific BW1 trailer
2017-02-01 20:30:42	@Espyo	:|
2017-02-01 20:39:20	Yoshi2	eh I probably wouldn't have made much progress anyway ¯\(ツ)/¯

2017-02-01 21:13:15	@Espyo	although they probably didn't add tags
2017-02-01 21:13:26	@Espyo	so it's not like it could show up on related videos or recommendations or anything
2017-02-01 21:13:32	@Espyo	at least, if the "None" description is anything to go by
2017-02-01 21:15:34	Yoshi2	what the fuck my video of me playing a level with doubled terrain height is getting close to 500 views
2017-02-01 21:16:13	@Espyo	hehehe nice

2017-02-01 21:48:47	Yoshi2	nintendo will NOT be ready for the server load
2017-02-01 21:48:55	@Espyo	 100% guaranteed they won't

2017-02-02 19:53:04	Testyo	Probably a good move on Chrome (on a mac) command+arrow key goes back/forward
2017-02-02 20:01:37	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2017-02-02 20:01:37	Testyo	i don't have a PS4, or ever played an Uncharted game
2017-02-02 20:01:42	Marty2000	when was it, Yoshi2?
2017-02-02 20:02:05	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-02 20:03:00	Yoshi2	2 hours ago
2017-02-02 20:03:06	Yoshi2	most of it was on voice chat though
2017-02-02 20:22:22	Marty2000	I see
2017-02-02 20:57:40	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyrFIVd3dSo this is a good high quality rip
2017-02-02 20:58:45	@Espyo	it had to
2017-02-02 20:58:54	@Espyo	with a name like "Lazy", it couldn't be anything else
2017-02-02 20:59:00	@Espyo	oh, Yoshi2, did you manage to get Heroes yet?
2017-02-02 20:59:25	Yoshi2	doesn't support my phone
2017-02-02 20:59:33	Yoshi2	android 4 is 2 old for it i guess
2017-02-02 20:59:54	@Espyo	oh, so you're in the same boat as me, eh
2017-02-02 20:59:59	@Espyo	what IS the current version of Android, anyway?
2017-02-02 21:00:08	@Espyo	should be like 4.6 or something, yeah?
2017-02-02 21:00:12	Yoshi2	haha
2017-02-02 21:00:16	Yoshi2	HAHAHHHAHAHHA no
2017-02-02 21:00:25	Yoshi2	we're up to 7 at the high end now
2017-02-02 21:00:28	Yoshi2	i think
2017-02-02 21:00:38	Yoshi2	my sister's phone has 5
2017-02-02 21:00:41	@Espyo	ain't very convincing then :P
2017-02-02 21:00:44	@Espyo	 5, really?
2017-02-02 21:00:46	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-02-02 21:00:47	@Espyo	well, either way
2017-02-02 21:00:51	@Espyo	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaba
2017-02-02 21:01:00	Yoshi2	I will probably steal hers for this
2017-02-02 21:01:04	@Espyo	according to the specs here, at the bottom of the page, 4.2 and above is supported
2017-02-02 21:01:05	@Espyo	so what the hell
2017-02-02 21:01:29	@Espyo	oh yeah, Nougat is 7.0
2017-02-02 21:01:32	@Espyo	I thought it was 4.7
2017-02-02 21:01:50	@Espyo	welp, still
2017-02-02 21:01:56	@Espyo	according to that, we HAVE to be able to play it
2017-02-02 21:02:04	@Espyo	there was this one review I saw
2017-02-02 21:02:05	Yoshi2	4.2 and above
2017-02-02 21:02:08	Yoshi2	that's the problem
2017-02-02 21:02:11	Yoshi2	I'm on 4.0something
2017-02-02 21:02:17	@Espyo	that said it wasn't running because of it being an Intel processor
2017-02-02 21:02:20	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-02 21:02:25	@Espyo	I'm on 4.2, and still no go
2017-02-02 21:02:40	@Espyo	I've talked to friends who play it
2017-02-02 21:02:42	@Espyo	and I need it SO BADLY
2017-02-02 21:02:59	@Espyo	well, my phone's shit anyway
2017-02-02 21:02:59	@Espyo	so I'm buying a new one tomorrow
2017-02-02 21:02:59	@Espyo	I've already decided earlier today
2017-02-02 21:05:22	Yoshi2	my parents keep bugging me about "have you decided on a phone for your bday yet?" since last bday
2017-02-02 21:05:38	@Espyo	well, now's the time
2017-02-02 21:05:42	Yoshi2	definitely
2017-02-02 21:05:43	@Espyo	the waifus are calling
2017-02-02 21:06:06	@Espyo	just DON'T. BUY. ARCHOS
2017-02-02 21:06:09	@Espyo	good grief
2017-02-02 21:06:21	@Espyo	I'm going with good old Samsung from here on out, eesh
2017-02-02 21:08:41	Yoshi2	the s7 edge is sweet ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ) 
2017-02-02 21:09:21	@Espyo	isn't that one the bomb in disguise?
2017-02-02 21:09:49	Yoshi2	no, the bomb in disguise was the note 7
2017-02-02 21:09:55	Yoshi2	or note s7
2017-02-02 21:10:00	Yoshi2	idk it had note in the name
2017-02-02 21:10:21	@Espyo	oh

2017-02-02 21:13:06	@Espyo	yet my phone is 4.2?
2017-02-02 21:13:16	@Espyo	I can probably play it on my tablet
2017-02-02 21:13:17	@Espyo	but
2017-02-02 21:13:21	@Espyo	if I can't port over the save file
2017-02-02 21:13:25	@Espyo	then what good will it do? ;_;
2017-02-02 21:13:33	@Espyo	oh heck yes, Yoshi2
2017-02-02 21:13:44	@Espyo	I can't help but go back to that rip every other day
2017-02-02 21:13:47	@Espyo	it's so good
2017-02-02 21:17:12	Yoshi2	this screws with audio channels it is weird https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4mSPualluY
2017-02-02 21:18:48	@Espyo	IT WORKS ON MY TABLET
2017-02-02 21:18:52	@Espyo	[groans audibly]
2017-02-02 21:23:51	Yoshi2	heh
2017-02-02 21:24:13	Yoshi2	first I thought about getting a nexus 5x because dat android updates
2017-02-02 21:24:27	Yoshi2	but I'm reading it has hardware issues that might eventually cause it to fail
2017-02-02 21:24:43	Yoshi2	I'm not taking a new phone which will fail before my old one does
2017-02-02 21:25:05	@Espyo	ouch
2017-02-02 21:25:13	@Espyo	sigh, I just don't know anything about phones
2017-02-02 21:25:15	@Espyo	so I'm going in mostly blind
2017-02-02 21:25:24	@Espyo	I'll ask my boss tomorrow for tips, but
2017-02-02 21:27:43	Yoshi2	a friend told me now is a bad time because many new phones come out later this year
2017-02-02 21:27:51	Yoshi2	but i ain't got that much time
2017-02-02 21:28:59	@Espyo	same
2017-02-02 21:29:07	@Espyo	plus, I don't care about being up to date
2017-02-02 21:29:16	@Espyo	I just want a device I can use to make calls with, and play mini-games while on the bus
2017-02-02 21:29:26	@Espyo	and also do some Python work every once in a while, but yeah

2017-02-03 21:12:14	Yoshi2	a guy from the BW discord left it because he decided to leave a bunch of servers he doesn't visit anymore :(
2017-02-03 21:12:51	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-03 21:12:54	@Espyo	well, I guess it makes sense
2017-02-03 21:16:11	Yoshi2	Espyo: have you asked your boss for phone advice yet?
2017-02-03 21:33:16	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-03 21:33:25	@Espyo	he recommended me this http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_364276.html
2017-02-03 21:33:29	@Espyo	but I'm not so sure...
2017-02-03 21:33:36	@Espyo	I mean, shouldn't I buy a store phone?
2017-02-03 21:33:45	@Espyo	I'll know where the thing goes in the case it breaks down I need to send it for warranty
2017-02-03 21:33:55	@Espyo	as opposed to here, where I'll probably have to ship it half-country
2017-02-03 21:34:07	@Espyo	and I'm not so sure I want something so overpowered
2017-02-03 21:34:29	@Espyo	I just want something that can run Heroes, which should be almost anything, really, and doesn't have firmware that's falling apart
2017-02-03 21:35:07	Yoshi2	I played some of heroes on my sister's phone
2017-02-03 21:35:17	Yoshi2	it was neat

2017-02-03 23:17:30	@Espyo	that sounds like a plan
2017-02-03 23:17:48	Yoshi2|offline	there are dancing characters that need to be cut out
2017-02-03 23:18:10	@Espyo	so, are you going to painstakingly go through every frame and airbrush them?

2017-02-03 23:24:41	Yoshi2|offline	but it's anime so there are maybe a couple of unique frames in the dance :D
2017-02-03 23:25:00	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2017-02-03 23:26:25	Yoshi2|offline	but seriously it's maybe 4 frames for this dance per character

2017-02-04 12:48:03	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-04 12:48:11	@Espyo	you know, if my alarm hadn't woken me up
2017-02-04 12:48:15	@Espyo	I'd probably sleep for another half hour
2017-02-04 12:48:18	@Espyo	 14 hours in total
2017-02-04 12:48:25	@Espyo	DOUBLE of what some doctors recommend
2017-02-04 12:48:34	@Espyo	I SERIOUSLY don't understand that whole 7 hour nonsense
2017-02-04 12:48:54	@Espyo	granted, I was pretty tired since I hadn't really rested my body since I got sick last week
2017-02-04 12:48:56	@Espyo	but still
2017-02-04 12:49:55	Yoshi2	having to spend 5 hours in the morning without you is absolute suffering :(

2017-02-04 12:50:14	Testyo	not that this is a pressing issue, but would you want more sounds?

2017-02-04 12:54:26	Yoshi2	my sense of duty is far stronger than my desire to sleep

2017-02-04 13:02:48	Marty2000	Hey Espyo and Testyo
2017-02-04 13:02:49	Testyo	well, I didn't include the other types because I have it, then Category:PCW appears along with Category:PCWEnemies
2017-02-04 13:02:54	Yoshi2	also I had to tell a friend that these two characters https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/274637718116630538/277408221075865601/bk-ro_500-unk-pxv.jpg https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/274637718116630538/277408472717328384/bk-ro_500-kancolle-raiou-1a.jpg are different (warning swimsuits)

2017-02-04 13:18:29	Yoshi2	well then i'm afraid we can't be friends anymore
2017-02-04 13:18:36	Yoshi2	asses are just fake boobs
2017-02-04 13:18:46	@Espyo	wow, harsh
2017-02-04 13:18:53	@Espyo	I'm like a halves-man
2017-02-04 13:18:58	@Espyo	I just like half-and-half

2017-02-04 14:28:51	@Espyo	this is awesome https://www.gamedev.net/resources/_/technical/game-programming/anomalies-in-x-ray-engine-r4440
2017-02-04 14:29:05	@Espyo	I love all sorts of articles that just show dumb stuff in AAA developer code
2017-02-04 15:00:28	@J	at least that code looks like the developer knew what they were trying to do
2017-02-04 15:01:00	@J	the funniest code is where you can tell they had no idea what was going on, and just kept making random permutations until it seemed to work
2017-02-04 15:01:08	@J	usually the first step is adding a try/catch
2017-02-04 15:01:39	@J	the second step is commenting out the suspect line and trying it like that
2017-02-04 15:02:25	@Espyo	hehe yeah
2017-02-04 15:53:40	Testyo	OH coverage than central NYC

2017-02-04 16:39:46	@Espyo	nice
2017-02-04 16:40:32	@Espyo	ugh, I'm trying to get a perpendicular line to another one, given one of its points
2017-02-04 16:40:48	@Espyo	but of course, the day one of stackoverflow's answers helps will be the end of the world
2017-02-04 16:40:55	@Espyo	I bet there's like a 3-line answer for this
2017-02-04 16:41:02	@Espyo	but the people there use code to discuss mathematical theories
2017-02-04 16:41:03	@Espyo	just
2017-02-04 16:41:06	@Espyo	just give me the code
2017-02-04 16:41:27	@Espyo	if I felt like thinking about academic-level geometry and mathematics, I sure as fuck wouldn't be asking on stackoverflow, would I?
2017-02-04 16:41:35	@Espyo	I'd have figured it out myself
2017-02-04 16:41:41	Yoshi2	on a 2D plane?
2017-02-04 16:41:50	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-04 16:45:20	Yoshi2	Espyo: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-parallel-perpendicular.html
2017-02-04 16:46:07	Yoshi2	if you have the slope m1 of a line, the perpendicular line to it has the slope m2 = -1/m1 apparently
2017-02-04 16:46:22	@Espyo	thing is, this goes into slope territory
2017-02-04 16:46:27	@Espyo	I definitely don't need to go that far
2017-02-04 16:46:33	@Espyo	it's like trying to get the distance between two points
2017-02-04 16:46:39	@Espyo	by drawing the two points on a canvas
2017-02-04 16:46:49	@Espyo	taking a screenshot of the program
2017-02-04 16:46:58	@Espyo	passing it through a neural network that detects where they are
2017-02-04 16:47:03	@Espyo	creates a virtual ruler
2017-02-04 16:47:06	@Espyo	and measures the distance
2017-02-04 16:47:10	Yoshi2	no
2017-02-04 16:47:13	Yoshi2	not really, no
2017-02-04 16:47:25	@Espyo	instead of Pythagorean's theorem
2017-02-04 16:48:15	Yoshi2	how do you want to get the perpendicular line? If you have no starting coordinates for that perpendicular line, all you will have is the slope
2017-02-04 16:49:08	Yoshi2	you could put the starting coordinate somewhere on the first line but there are infinite possibilities for that practically
2017-02-04 16:49:15	Yoshi2	unless you have a very specific plan
2017-02-04 16:50:26	Yoshi2	calculating the slope just requires two points on the first line
2017-02-04 16:50:46	Yoshi2	let's call them (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
2017-02-04 16:51:20	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/perpendicular.png I just want to get the red line
2017-02-04 16:51:42	@Espyo	I seriously think that there has to be some simple equation for this
2017-02-04 16:52:04	Yoshi2	i know maths is hard but it isn't that hard
2017-02-04 16:52:53	Yoshi2	so you have the coordinates (x1,y1) for point L1, and coordinates (x2,y2) for L2
2017-02-04 16:53:35	Yoshi2	the slope between L1 and L2 is m1 = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
2017-02-04 16:53:52	Yoshi2	then the slope of your perpendicular line is m2 = -1/m1
2017-02-04 16:54:15	@Espyo	ok... but then what do I do with the slope?
2017-02-04 16:54:21	Yoshi2	you know the equation for a line is f(x) = a + m*x where m is the slope
2017-02-04 16:54:30	Yoshi2	*function for a line
2017-02-04 16:54:33	@Espyo	I know I've learnt that, but I never memorized it
2017-02-04 16:54:34	@Espyo	but yeah
2017-02-04 16:57:28	@Espyo	http://stackoverflow.com/a/1811636 uhm, looks like this is it in a nutshell
2017-02-04 16:59:05	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-04 16:59:46	@Espyo	that wasn't so hard
2017-02-04 17:00:02	@Espyo	see, I want to skip all of the figuring-out stuff and just want an answer
2017-02-04 17:00:20	@Espyo	am I unable to figure it out by myself knowing the theory? no
2017-02-04 17:00:24	@Espyo	am I lazy? kinda?
2017-02-04 17:00:44	@Espyo	I want to focus on working on the engine, not figuring out the exact code to a function every dev and their grandma wrote in the past
2017-02-04 17:01:01	@Espyo	I can figure out what it does, and I could think about it myself from scratch
2017-02-04 17:01:03	@Espyo	but why?
2017-02-04 17:01:17	@Espyo	nuts to that, just give me a function and we can all go our merry ways
2017-02-04 17:01:26	@Espyo	but that's the only SO answer I could find that didn't go through hoops
2017-02-04 17:01:35	@Espyo	everybody else goes on explaining slopes and tangents and such
2017-02-04 17:01:37	@Espyo	just
2017-02-04 17:01:43	@Espyo	just give me an answer, please
2017-02-04 17:01:52	Yoshi2	maybe if you looked for places other than stackoverflow you could've found a direct answer
2017-02-04 17:01:58	@Espyo	I did
2017-02-04 17:02:03	@Espyo	I got even more convoluted answers, somehow
2017-02-04 17:02:27	@Espyo	mainly pages with math lectures and theoretical academic teaching
2017-02-04 17:02:33	@Espyo	so those go out of their way even harder
2017-02-04 17:02:36	Yoshi2	what the FUCK
2017-02-04 17:02:56	@Espyo	I even went on page 3 of the search results
2017-02-04 17:03:00	@Espyo	basically the deep web, really
2017-02-04 17:03:29	Yoshi2	https://www.google.de/search?q=line+calculate+slope
2017-02-04 17:03:43	@Espyo	that's just it, I wanted to skip the slope part!
2017-02-04 17:03:46	@Espyo	and I did, with that SO answer
2017-02-04 17:03:59	Yoshi2	..................................................
2017-02-04 17:04:17	@Espyo	hey, don't look at me like that
2017-02-04 17:04:32	Yoshi2	you did not skip the slope part
2017-02-04 17:04:51	Yoshi2	"The slope of the line, m, through (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is m = (y1 - y2) / (x1 - x2)" it's right here
2017-02-04 17:04:56	Yoshi2	here is your slope
2017-02-04 17:05:05	@Espyo	but I don't want slopes!
2017-02-04 17:05:08	@Espyo	I want coordinates!
2017-02-04 17:06:11	Yoshi2	"To find the perpendicular of a given line which also passes through a particular point (x, y), solve the equation y = (-1/m)x + b, substituting in the known values of m, x, and y to solve for b." you still need the slope tho
2017-02-04 17:06:39	@Espyo	right
2017-02-04 17:06:43	@Espyo	I do need it
2017-02-04 17:06:49	@Espyo	mathematically, there is no other known way
2017-02-04 17:06:51	@Espyo	my problem
2017-02-04 17:06:54	@Espyo	is that I want that transparent to me
2017-02-04 17:07:12	@Espyo	http://stackoverflow.com/a/1811636 from this answer, I don't need to know that it involves slopes, or anything else
2017-02-04 17:07:24	@Espyo	I just feed it my known variables, and it spits me the variables I want

2017-02-04 17:09:14	@Espyo	that is bold
2017-02-04 17:09:33	@Espyo	here's the thing though
2017-02-04 17:09:38	@Espyo	I only glazed over slopes
2017-02-04 17:09:40	@Espyo	and I did so in college
2017-02-04 17:09:56	@Espyo	yeah, somehow, my high-school teachings skipped over most of the important stuff
2017-02-04 17:10:09	@Espyo	no joke? I didn't know what sine, cosine, or tangent were till I reached college
2017-02-04 17:10:10	@Espyo	no. joke.
2017-02-04 17:10:31	@Espyo	not because I slept in class or anything like that >_>
2017-02-04 17:10:36	@Espyo	I legit wasn't taught it
2017-02-04 17:10:57	@Espyo	on top of that, mathematics were always some of my worst subjects
2017-02-04 17:11:02	@Espyo	I get geometry just fine
2017-02-04 17:11:30	@Espyo	heck, I've made a whole area editor that relies heavily on quite a few geometry concepts
2017-02-04 17:11:32	@Espyo	basic and advanced
2017-02-04 17:11:38	@Espyo	but I just don't know ALL of them, okay?
2017-02-04 17:11:52	@Espyo	and until I need to dissect them, I just want pre-digested answers!
2017-02-04 17:11:57	@Espyo	I ain't got the time to learn them
2017-02-04 17:12:02	@Espyo	what for? people already did the learning for me
2017-02-04 17:12:09	Yoshi2	and that's fiiiiiiine, but making such a big deal of "I don't even want to KNOW about slopes" makes me sad
2017-02-04 17:12:19	@Espyo	because it's true
2017-02-04 17:12:25	@Espyo	I really don't have the time to have to think about it
2017-02-04 17:12:31	@Espyo	I could learn about it just for the knowledge of it
2017-02-04 17:12:33	@Espyo	but
2017-02-04 17:12:43	@Espyo	I don't need to know how a car is made to drive it
2017-02-04 17:12:59	@Espyo	there may come a day where I'll need to learn about slopes because there is no pre-made answer to my problem
2017-02-04 17:13:07	Yoshi2	J help me
2017-02-04 17:13:11	Yoshi2	my worldview is crumbling
2017-02-04 17:13:18	Yoshi2	are slopes really that unimportant
2017-02-04 17:13:29	@Espyo	they are if you don't need them
2017-02-04 17:13:30	@Espyo	think about it
2017-02-04 17:13:44	@Espyo	hey, put it like this:
2017-02-04 17:13:55	@Espyo	I've done all of my leisure and professional programming up until now
2017-02-04 17:13:57	@Espyo	over 10 years of it
2017-02-04 17:14:03	@Espyo	without once ever needing to know how slopes work
2017-02-04 17:14:09	@Espyo	that has to say something
2017-02-04 17:14:41	@Espyo	needing to know how multiplications with decimals work? that's important
2017-02-04 17:15:03	Yoshi2	slopes are simply the answer to "if I walked x units forward, how high would I end up?"
2017-02-04 17:15:13	@Espyo	but this? most of the stuff that involves slopes is for known answers to common problems
2017-02-04 17:15:36	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-04 17:15:43	@Espyo	never thought about it that way
2017-02-04 17:15:48	@Espyo	but I'm sure I could figure that out some other way
2017-02-04 17:16:05	@Espyo	or if not, I probably would have a function that generates the line and just obtain the Y given the X
2017-02-04 17:16:14	@Espyo	without really having to think about the line proper
2017-02-04 17:16:28	@Espyo	look, slopes probably make a LOT of sense
2017-02-04 17:16:33	@Espyo	they're not much harder than subtracting two numbers
2017-02-04 17:16:41	@Espyo	but if I was never taught them, what do you want me to do?
2017-02-04 17:16:48	@Espyo	and if I can't be bothered to :P
2017-02-04 17:16:51	@Espyo	I've already got the answer to my problem
2017-02-04 17:16:56	@Espyo	so I can leave them in the dust
2017-02-04 17:18:16	Yoshi2	what, but the answer just says "the slope m is (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)" (or the 1 and 2 switched around) and then you need to add the stuff into the equation and solve it
2017-02-04 17:18:42	@Espyo	that's fair
2017-02-04 17:18:44	@Espyo	thing is
2017-02-04 17:18:47	@Espyo	I didn't even look at it
2017-02-04 17:19:12	@Espyo	because I know I could just get an answer like this http://stackoverflow.com/a/1811636 eventually
2017-02-04 17:19:23	@Espyo	so as soon as I saw words I didn't recognize, I just glanced over them
2017-02-04 17:19:30	@Espyo	lazy? ok, this part is lazy, I admit
2017-02-04 17:19:31	@Espyo	but it worked
2017-02-04 17:19:35	@Espyo	can't argue with that
2017-02-04 17:21:09	Yoshi2	that is the answer i was talking about
2017-02-04 17:21:39	@Espyo	huh?
2017-02-04 17:21:58	@Espyo	I mean
2017-02-04 17:22:03	@Espyo	I got pure, raw code from that
2017-02-04 17:22:10	@Espyo	without any theory behind it
2017-02-04 17:22:25	Yoshi2	oh
2017-02-04 17:22:37	Yoshi2	nevermind, i was looking at the answer below which was shiny
2017-02-04 17:23:01	@Espyo	ah
2017-02-04 17:23:28	Yoshi2	but don't take pride in not knowing about slopes, that feels very anti-intellectual-ish :(
2017-02-04 17:23:36	@Espyo	bottom line of this whole conversation: if I can find an answer that just contains code for a well-known problem, without me having to think about it, I'll take it
2017-02-04 17:23:49	@Espyo	eeeehhh I guess I agree
2017-02-04 17:24:00	@Espyo	I take pride in knowing this or that about algebra, even if it's not a whole lot
2017-02-04 17:24:11	@Espyo	and slopes seems accessible enough that I have no excuse to not know it
2017-02-04 17:24:31	@Espyo	but nowadays, I'd have to go out of my way to learn it, even if it'd take me like 10 minutes to fully understand it
2017-02-04 17:24:42	@Espyo	I just want to show a graph on the area editor, not go back to studying ;_;
2017-02-04 17:26:41	Yoshi2	i was ready to chew the food for you and spit out some code that would do what you wanted if you didn't find a ready answer
2017-02-04 17:27:05	@Espyo	well, thanks
2017-02-04 17:27:12	@Espyo	but I was 100% sure somebody had to have done it before
2017-02-04 17:27:22	@Espyo	I mean, really? finding a perpendicular line to another line, given one known point?
2017-02-04 17:27:30	@Espyo	that has to be used in at least half of the AAA games out there
2017-02-04 17:27:51	@Espyo	and thousands upon thousands of indie projects
2017-02-04 17:27:56	@Espyo	somebody HAS to have done this
2017-02-04 17:28:14	@Espyo	sometimes I find trickier problems that are more exclusive to me
2017-02-04 17:28:26	@Espyo	in those cases, I have no problem with studying and researching until I can learn how to do it myself
2017-02-04 17:28:31	@Espyo	I've done that a number of times here
2017-02-04 17:28:36	@Espyo	but for this? come ooooooon
2017-02-04 17:33:18	Yoshi2	on many problems I'm sure there is a conspiracy going on to prevent people from just seeing the solution to the problems
2017-02-04 17:33:29	@Espyo	there has to
2017-02-04 17:33:34	@Espyo	maybe
2017-02-04 17:33:39	@Espyo	it's a ploy to increase the world's IQ
2017-02-04 17:33:50	@Espyo	forcing people to think about the solution instead of giving it them
2017-02-04 17:34:17	Yoshi2	slopes are not part of that I'm sure because the direct solution just involves taking available formulas and then doing substitution so all that's left is you having to put in the coordinates
2017-02-04 17:34:27	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-04 17:34:53	@J	hey, if you're coding, you have to think
2017-02-04 17:35:02	@J	if you're not thinking, your code is buggy anyway
2017-02-04 17:35:06	@Espyo	but
2017-02-04 17:35:07	Yoshi2	<3 J 
2017-02-04 17:35:09	@Espyo	code's always buggy
2017-02-04 17:35:21	@Espyo	hey, I don't have to think about the processor instructions that go inside a square root call
2017-02-04 17:35:26	@Espyo	same deal
2017-02-04 17:35:39	@J	anyway, the term I would use in a search to find just 'the answer' would be 'algorithm'
2017-02-04 17:35:40	@Espyo	I don't want to think about what operations are done inside my get_perpendicular_from_point()
2017-02-04 17:35:45	@Espyo	I did
2017-02-04 17:35:49	@Espyo	right from the get go
2017-02-04 17:36:01	@J	let me try it then
2017-02-04 17:36:06	@Espyo	and it normally works fine
2017-02-04 17:36:21	@J	https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=perpendicular+line+algorithm&gws_rd=cr&ei=BhGWWKqbG8qbgAbO1KrABw http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133897/how-do-you-find-a-point-at-a-given-perpendicular-distance-from-a-line first result
2017-02-04 17:36:21	@Espyo	dunno why this time I was thrown for an existential quest
2017-02-04 17:36:32	@J	first answer just has some code
2017-02-04 17:36:40	@J	which looks like what you want
2017-02-04 17:37:09	@Espyo	at the end points
2017-02-04 17:37:16	@Espyo	I wanted at an arbitrary point in the plane
2017-02-04 17:37:31	@Espyo	in my case, the point wasn't even on the line necessarily
2017-02-04 17:37:44	@Espyo	but yeah, for that case, that was an easy find, yeah
2017-02-04 17:38:16	@J	a point perpendicular to your line at the middle is perpendicular to a subset of your line at the end
2017-02-04 17:38:18	@J	right?
2017-02-04 17:38:57	@J	ie. you already have a line you want to find a perpendicular to at its end
2017-02-04 17:39:02	@J	and that line is part of the whole line
2017-02-04 17:39:06	@Espyo	>a point perpendicular to your line
2017-02-04 17:39:08	@Espyo	huh?
2017-02-04 17:39:14	Yoshi2	points can't be perpendiculat 
2017-02-04 17:39:15	@Espyo	aren't all points technically perpendicular to a line?
2017-02-04 17:39:21	@J	'a point on a line perpendicular to your line'
2017-02-04 17:39:29	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-04 17:39:31	@J	(I wanted to avoid too many words)
2017-02-04 17:39:38	@J	because lazy and wordy
2017-02-04 17:40:05	@Espyo	ok, now I'm burned out
2017-02-04 17:40:08	@Espyo	the entire conversation is moot
2017-02-04 17:40:10	@Espyo	I've got what I needed
2017-02-04 17:40:12	@J	also this guy's solution is better than using slopes
2017-02-04 17:40:13	@J	so there
2017-02-04 17:40:30	@Espyo	...I've spent an hour on this conversation, literally
2017-02-04 17:40:37	@Espyo	it's one hour starting now
2017-02-04 17:40:56	@Espyo	all of the variables I knew where I was going to put for this, all of the functions I knew I was going to create, all of the parts of the code I knew were going to be affected by this feature
2017-02-04 17:41:00	@Espyo	all of this is gone
2017-02-04 17:41:09	@Espyo	just because the internet didn't want to give me my low-hanging fruit :(
2017-02-04 17:41:34	@Espyo	yeah... that really is what it is, it's low-hanging fruit
2017-02-04 17:41:59	@Espyo	I'm not asking for an optimized algorithm on collision checking with all of a model's polygons versus all of another model's polygons
2017-02-04 17:42:00	Yoshi2	main issue with calculating the slope is if x1 = x2 because then you have 0
2017-02-04 17:42:11	@Espyo	why are you guys making me work so hard for such a simple answer?
2017-02-04 17:42:28	@Espyo	oh, and that's actually possible, I think
2017-02-04 17:42:32	@Espyo	well, I'll add an exception case
2017-02-04 17:42:49	@Espyo	you shouldn't be asking for a perpendicular line against a "line" that is size 0 anyway
2017-02-04 17:44:15	Yoshi2	doesn't have to be size 0, might be completely vertical
2017-02-04 17:44:43	@Espyo	oops, misread
2017-02-04 17:44:59	@Espyo	uhm
2017-02-04 17:45:10	@Espyo	looking at it, it looks like it's only a problem if x1 = x2 AND y1 = y2
2017-02-04 17:46:22	Yoshi2	ah right
2017-02-04 17:46:56	@J	if you're looking at http://stackoverflow.com/a/1811636 - some guy in a comment said the answer is wrong?
2017-02-04 17:47:46	@Espyo	>@jbertron: the answer is correct, but make sure that when running this code you use longs or doubles as the type for all vars, as with large numbers the calculation can easily overflow and you get a wrong answer.
2017-02-04 17:47:51	@Espyo	ok, LOOK
2017-02-04 17:48:01	@Espyo	see this? https://github.com/Espyo/Pikmin_fangame_engine/blob/master/Source/source/geometry_utils.cpp
2017-02-04 17:48:06	@Espyo	it's got a bunch of functions
2017-02-04 17:48:15	@Espyo	for problems that are already well-known and studied in the programming world
2017-02-04 17:48:24	@Espyo	I copied them because I don't have to rethink them myself
2017-02-04 17:48:26	@Espyo	all of these worked fine
2017-02-04 17:48:28	@Espyo	why is THIS ONE
2017-02-04 17:48:36	@Espyo	A SIMPLE GEOMETRIC QUESTION
2017-02-04 17:48:39	@Espyo	GIVING ME SUCH A HARD TIME?
2017-02-04 17:48:46	@Espyo	nuts to this, I'm grabbing something to eat
2017-02-04 17:48:48	@Espyo	unbelievable
2017-02-04 17:49:02	@Espyo	might as well ditch the entire feature altogether, since it's legit causing more work than it deserves
2017-02-04 17:49:46	Yoshi2	it's about slopes which means me and J get to use our mighty high horses
2017-02-04 17:49:55	Yoshi2	:^)
2017-02-04 17:56:24	Yoshi2	it's really unlucky that the problem you happened to stumble over was slopes. If it was anything else I probably would've shrugged because a lot of maths really is a pain
2017-02-04 17:59:59	@Espyo	if you agree that having to overthink a known answer is a chore that you don't want to do, why'd you give me such a hard time when I did the same? ;_;
2017-02-04 18:00:33	@Espyo	okay, if nothing else works, I'll get the angle of the original line, create a line from the known point in the same angle, rotate that line 90 degrees, and get my damn final perpendicular line
2017-02-04 18:00:34	Testyo	90 degrees = 1.5708 rad
2017-02-04 18:00:38	@Espyo	it's unoptimized and it's stupid
2017-02-04 18:00:42	@Espyo	but so far it seems like the only damn way
2017-02-04 18:02:19	Yoshi2	what was wrong with the other thing?
2017-02-04 18:04:34	@Espyo	what, the solution by that guy on SO?
2017-02-04 18:04:49	@Espyo	commenters are saying it's wrong, and indeed, it's not working here
2017-02-04 18:05:05	@Espyo	though I could've just fumbled somewhere on my end
2017-02-04 18:06:37	Yoshi2	I am currently figuring out what is up with it
2017-02-04 18:06:47	@Espyo	okay, thanks
2017-02-04 18:07:12	Yoshi2	it's not the usual slopes way (if you do it with slopes you have the issue of if x1 = x2 then DIVIDE BY ZERO cause infinite slope)
2017-02-04 18:08:15	Yoshi2	an idea i have is perpendicular 2D vectors
2017-02-04 18:09:29	Yoshi2	oooooh perpendicular vectors could work
2017-02-04 18:13:29	@Espyo	GAH, it wasn't working here because my function wasn't returning a value
2017-02-04 18:13:34	@Espyo	but damn if the compiler warns me about that
2017-02-04 18:13:41	@Espyo	nah, let's just keep it silent
2017-02-04 18:13:41	@Espyo	ugh
2017-02-04 18:14:13	Yoshi2	vector way: http://pastebin.com/B0s7tHjx
2017-02-04 18:14:44	Yoshi2	need to buy some batteries now brb
2017-02-04 18:14:49	@Espyo	that makes a lot of sense
2017-02-04 18:14:53	@Espyo	and it's probably cheaper too
2017-02-04 18:15:01	@Espyo	ergh... well, it uses the square root...
2017-02-04 18:15:16	@Espyo	screw it, I'm going with that, though
2017-02-04 18:19:05	@J	if you already know the length of your other line somehow you can skip the length part
2017-02-04 18:19:16	@J	not sure what the use case is
2017-02-04 18:20:27	@Espyo	I don't know the length before-hand
2017-02-04 18:20:33	@Espyo	but I only run it once per frame, so it's basically free
2017-02-04 18:20:47	@Espyo	I'm giving a cross-section view feature to the area editor
2017-02-04 18:21:02	@Espyo	when you're working on a top-down view, it's a bit hard to visualize how it looks from the side sometimes
2017-02-04 18:21:35	@Espyo	like, you know this sector is height 200, but how big is that compared to this square on the floor? does it look like a tower, or a very short step?
2017-02-04 18:21:42	@Espyo	so this cross-section thing makes it easy to visualize that
2017-02-04 18:21:52	@Espyo	you draw the cross-section's line
2017-02-04 18:22:11	@Espyo	and now, I want to make it so you can skim your cursor over it to also know where the cursor is on the cross-section
2017-02-04 18:22:22	@Espyo	but instead of requiring the cursor to be exactly on the line (as if)
2017-02-04 18:22:29	@Espyo	I want the cursor to just pass perpendicularly to it
2017-02-04 18:22:35	@Espyo	I'll show a screenshot of how it looks in a bit
2017-02-04 18:22:43	@J	yeah, it's a bit confusing
2017-02-04 18:22:46	@J	sounds like a thing anyway
2017-02-04 18:22:53	@Espyo	yeah, it makes full sense in my head
2017-02-04 18:22:56	@Espyo	but it's so hard to explain
2017-02-04 18:22:58	@Espyo	even though it's simple
2017-02-04 18:23:03	@Espyo	but I'm sure a screenshot will explain everything
2017-02-04 18:44:51	@Espyo	your code isn't working, Yoshi2
2017-02-04 18:47:12	@Espyo	and it makes sense
2017-02-04 18:47:13	@J	silly, you need to add semi-colons for C++
2017-02-04 18:47:16	@Espyo	you're not obtaining the normal
2017-02-04 18:47:19	@Espyo	ooooooh right
2017-02-04 18:47:35	@J	yeah, he forgot to do that part
2017-02-04 18:47:36	@Espyo	and the whole "float" thing before the variables, yeah
2017-02-04 18:47:50	@J	should be norm_dx=-dy/length, norm_dy=dx/length
2017-02-04 18:47:55	@J	I think
2017-02-04 18:48:00	@Espyo	yeah, you're just getting the normalized vector that represents the line, not its normal
2017-02-04 18:48:22	@Espyo	hm, I don't think that's right
2017-02-04 18:48:55	@Espyo	but I'll try
2017-02-04 18:49:00	@J	uh...it's 1/ maybe?
2017-02-04 18:49:22	@Espyo	hey, that works, but only for one side of the line
2017-02-04 18:49:47	@J	yeah, I'm not crazy
2017-02-04 18:49:49	@J	I swear
2017-02-04 18:49:54	@J	what do you mean 'one side'?
2017-02-04 18:50:04	@Espyo	...and only if the line is axis-aligned
2017-02-04 18:50:18	@Espyo	like, if the line is to the side (same Y on its points)
2017-02-04 18:50:26	@Espyo	you skim your cursor above the line, it works
2017-02-04 18:50:29	@Espyo	below the line, it doesn't
2017-02-04 18:51:30	@Espyo	pbbt, and the engineers at Ubisoft have trouble coding strands of hair that don't tank the framerate
2017-02-04 18:51:36	@J	pbbt
2017-02-04 18:51:41	@Espyo	they should try getting the perpendicular of a line
2017-02-04 18:51:44	@Espyo	now that's a REAL mental exercise
2017-02-04 18:51:55	@Espyo	I'll leave whatever that means to your imagination
2017-02-04 18:52:05	@Espyo	but for me, it's like a raspberry, but more subtle
2017-02-04 18:52:28	@J	like a sigh starting with 'p'?
2017-02-04 18:52:52	@Espyo	nah, that's like a "pugh"
2017-02-04 18:53:25	@Espyo	ok, I've found an alternative way
2017-02-04 18:53:31	@J	so yeah, I guess you have decide whether to negate both the norm_* somehow
2017-02-04 18:53:32	@Espyo	the algorithm that returns the closest point in a line
2017-02-04 18:53:54	@Espyo	yeah, but there has to be a smarter way than hard checking
2017-02-04 18:54:02	@J	that is nearer what you want, yeah
2017-02-04 18:54:12	@J	when you originally asked I thought you had a 3rd point ON the line
2017-02-04 18:54:17	@Espyo	aaah
2017-02-04 18:54:19	@J	which means there is no 'direction' of the normal
2017-02-04 18:54:23	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-04 18:54:24	@Espyo	but nope
2017-02-04 18:54:29	@Espyo	have you seen the diagram I posted earlier?
2017-02-04 18:54:40	@J	if you have a point off the line, that gives you your direction
2017-02-04 18:54:47	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/perpendicular.png
2017-02-04 18:55:03	@J	I did, but I didn't look very closely
2017-02-04 18:55:24	@J	in fact I ignored the whole left part, thought it was something unrelated
2017-02-04 18:55:29	@Espyo	heh
2017-02-04 18:56:00	@J	why do you want a direction anyway?
2017-02-04 18:56:07	@J	to draw a line to the cursor?
2017-02-04 18:56:56	@Espyo	not even that, I just want to know at what part of the base line it intersects
2017-02-04 18:57:08	@Espyo	like, the starting point of the base line, the ending point, or anywhere in between
2017-02-04 18:57:25	@Espyo	though I think I'll want to actually draw the line too, if it's not too clear what the cursor's role is in this feature
2017-02-04 18:59:54	Testyo	also why 32GB Germany into Concentration camps
2017-02-04 19:00:54	@J	whaaaaaaaat
2017-02-04 19:01:17	@J	you know, a game I made must've had to do all this too
2017-02-04 19:01:36	@Espyo	of course
2017-02-04 19:01:44	@J	http://ikn.org.uk/Sequence although maybe it was arbitrary angles here
2017-02-04 19:03:58	@Espyo	you don't have any geometrical functions in that code
2017-02-04 19:03:58	@Espyo	what
2017-02-04 19:04:05	@Espyo	or if you do, they're not in functions
2017-02-04 19:04:07	@Espyo	they're inline
2017-02-04 19:04:34	@J	I don't know
2017-02-04 19:04:40	@J	talk to many-years-ago me
2017-02-04 19:05:13	@J	I see, it's a 300-line game
2017-02-04 19:05:14	@J	one of those
2017-02-04 19:05:28	Yoshi2	[19:47:50] <J> should be norm_dx=-dy/length, norm_dy=dx/length
2017-02-04 19:05:53	Yoshi2	thx j, when I was outside I realized my error but it was too late to fix it :I
2017-02-04 19:06:09	@Espyo	that wasn't enough, though
2017-02-04 19:06:11	@J	or you just like to see Espyo suffer
2017-02-04 19:06:19	@Espyo	s/or/and
2017-02-04 19:08:43	@J	wow, that is actually 5 years ago
2017-02-04 19:08:45	@J	I am old indeed
2017-02-04 19:08:58	@Espyo	yeah... 2012 was 5 years ago
2017-02-04 19:11:58	@Espyo	and of course, because floating numbers are sins, it's possible that the "get closest point" function returns a point, but the "lines intersect" function thinks it doesn't belong to the line
2017-02-04 19:12:18	@J	of course
2017-02-04 19:19:26	Yoshi2	too bad programming doesn't have the precision that paper maths has
2017-02-04 19:19:34	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-04 19:19:38	@Espyo	I've found another way
2017-02-04 19:19:47	@Espyo	I'll just use the ratio from the "get closest point" function
2017-02-04 19:19:53	@Espyo	and skip the "lines intersect" one altogether
2017-02-04 19:20:03	@Espyo	uff, it only took me like 2 hours
2017-02-04 19:20:05	@Espyo	but it's finally done
2017-02-04 19:20:26	@Espyo	the entirety of the cross-section feature was 5 hours, and 2 of those were spent doing this ONE thing with the cursor
2017-02-04 19:21:24	@J	every time you seem like you know what you're doing, you come back 5 minutes later, angrier than ever
2017-02-04 19:21:30	@J	I have to say, I'm entertained
2017-02-04 19:22:05	@Espyo	I'm not even upset, I'm just unamused
2017-02-04 19:22:10	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/2017-02-04-192100_642x507_scrot.png but here's the final result
2017-02-04 19:22:19	@Espyo	ok, I guess I'm a bit upset
2017-02-04 19:22:30	Yoshi2	I'd love to say I was entertained but this is time wasted that I could've spent cutting out the dancing characters
2017-02-04 19:22:41	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-04 19:22:43	@J	such a loss
2017-02-04 19:22:47	@Espyo	thanks for that
2017-02-04 19:22:55	@Espyo	had to drag the two of you down this hell-hole with me
2017-02-04 19:22:58	@Espyo	but at least I emerged
2017-02-04 19:23:05	@Espyo	with a feature that looks like a graph paper scribble
2017-02-04 19:23:29	@J	tell me, where does the perpendicular even come into this
2017-02-04 19:23:36	@J	AFAICT you just pick 2 points and click go
2017-02-04 19:23:46	@Espyo	the mouse cursor
2017-02-04 19:23:54	@Espyo	in that image, my mouse cursor is slightly below and slightly to the right of B
2017-02-04 19:24:02	@Espyo	that's why the graph on the top-left has a vertical line
2017-02-04 19:24:21	@Espyo	if you move your mouse next to the red line, you see the white graph line move with you
2017-02-04 19:24:30	@Espyo	so you get a better idea of what you're looking at
2017-02-04 19:24:40	@Espyo	thing is, I couldn't force the user to have the mouse exactly on the line
2017-02-04 19:24:48	@Espyo	if I did, I wouldn't need this perpendicular nonsense
2017-02-04 19:25:01	@J	oh, so you didn't even need a 2D point, just a distance along the line
2017-02-04 19:25:11	@Espyo	yeah, not really
2017-02-04 19:25:19	@Espyo	the 2D point was to create a line to intersect with the red line
2017-02-04 19:25:27	@Espyo	where I could then extract the intersection point
2017-02-04 19:25:28	@J	there's probably a magic thing you could do to get that easier, but no point now
2017-02-04 19:25:33	@Espyo	but I guess I managed to bypass that in the end
2017-02-04 19:25:49	@Espyo	yeah, and if there is, I'm really not in the mindset to think about it
2017-02-04 19:29:27	Yoshi2	one of the courses I'm doing this semester in uni is actually about how stuff behaves when errors are introduced (e.g. doing maths with floats/doubles) and numerical ways of solving stuff so it's well conditioned
2017-02-04 19:29:40	@Espyo	oh, nice
2017-02-04 19:29:47	Yoshi2	the take-away I had from that is that floats and doubles are not to be trusted
2017-02-04 19:29:55	@Espyo	yeah, I learned that one from practice
2017-02-04 19:30:20	Yoshi2	and what was a huge mindfuck for me
2017-02-04 19:30:44	Yoshi2	multiplication is well conditioned, but addition/subtraction is poorly conditioned for some numbers
2017-02-04 19:31:22	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-04 19:31:25	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2017-02-04 19:32:13	Yoshi2	more specifically, adding/subtracting numbers that are nearly equal
2017-02-04 19:32:17	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance
2017-02-04 19:33:46	@Espyo	oh wow
2017-02-04 19:35:29	Yoshi2	I still have trouble wrapping my mind around it 
2017-02-04 19:35:40	Yoshi2	but it makes some sense
2017-02-04 19:37:55	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zT432Tokpo aww why do I find out about this Night of Fire christmas mix only now
2017-02-04 19:40:54	@Espyo	heh
2017-02-04 19:41:07	@Espyo	because you're not following SiIva daily
2017-02-04 19:48:47	@Espyo	I must've blacked out for several years
2017-02-04 19:48:50	@Espyo	but doing something like
2017-02-04 19:48:56	@Espyo	Point my_point(0, 0);
2017-02-04 19:48:59	@Espyo	is no longer valid C++
2017-02-04 19:49:20	@Espyo	and neither is Point my_point = Point(0, 0);
2017-02-04 20:01:50	Yoshi2	what IS valid c++ though?
2017-02-04 20:09:40	@Espyo	nothing
2017-02-04 20:29:45	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNrKXL8jJSo pianos are awesome

2017-02-05 12:38:59	Marty2000	I found an old "Official Nintendo Magazine" I had bought in 2010 that's about Super Mario Galaxy 2 and it's said that Luigi cannot perform a triple jump... which is wrong :P
2017-02-05 12:39:57	@Espyo	hah
2017-02-05 12:40:03	@Espyo	unless they mean the flip part
2017-02-05 12:40:08	@Espyo	he just flails a lot in his third jump, doesn't he?
2017-02-05 12:41:57	Marty2000	He does, but the way they say it means that he cannot perform a triple jump at all (only double jumps like Yoshi)
2017-02-05 12:44:47	Marty2000	On a separate note, a new formula had been used for that edition of the French ONM, which eventually led to the magazine not being produced anymore one year afterwards
2017-02-05 12:44:48	@Espyo	yep
2017-02-05 13:30:28	Yoshi2	I remember buying a gamecube magazine once
2017-02-05 13:30:55	Yoshi2	next month I was wondering why there was no further issue of the magazine
2017-02-05 13:31:16	Yoshi2	years later I realized, I bought the very last issue of that magazine
2017-02-05 13:37:44	@Espyo	hehe, nice
2017-02-05 13:43:14	Yoshi2	the feedback portion of that issue was a bit weird https://i.imgur.com/iUcy9cp.jpg https://i.imgur.com/902bOQm.jpg
2017-02-05 13:45:36	Yoshi2	first comment was some critique about how there was no 30 minute video of Zelda: TP gameplay when he registered on the site
2017-02-05 13:46:17	Yoshi2	and the answer by the magazine translates to "Filler text instead of Richy's Answer"
2017-02-05 13:48:02	Yoshi2	plus some other stuff I'd have to take time to translate it, but the woman with bloody clothing spooked me a bit at that time
2017-02-05 13:50:07	@Espyo	uh, wow
2017-02-05 13:53:39	Marty2000	http://imgur.com/a/M6Zet "Can the Action Replay for DS work with the Wii and its USB ports?" Answer: "Each console has its Action Replay, that weird tool that allows the player to use cheat codes. You know, we'd rather play retro" :P
2017-02-05 13:53:40	Yoshi2	no idea if the magazine was always like that or if they knew it would be the last issue and took some more liberties
2017-02-05 13:53:55	Marty2000	It's the issue with the Super Mario Galaxy 2 stuff
2017-02-05 13:54:29	Marty2000	And the woman sure is spooky, Yoshi2
2017-02-05 13:54:32	Marty2000	:(
2017-02-05 13:55:48	Yoshi2	the woman is there because somebody asked about (I guess) a continuation of Killer 7
2017-02-05 13:58:31	Yoshi2	and the answer by the magazine was something like "You really want to know why Iwazaru runs around in s a d o  m a s o clothing and how a children's c u t  o f f head gets to a "Tanksäule"? Really? You are scaring us.." (idk how to translate tanksäule but it is those tanking pillars at a gas station near which you park your car when you want to fill up your gas tank)

2017-02-05 14:07:17	Marty2000	Yeah... I think those magazines often receive such questions

2017-02-05 20:55:01	@Espyo	I can't laugh at this
2017-02-05 20:55:03	@Espyo	this is actually good
2017-02-05 20:58:30	Yoshi2	yeah, it actually came out pretty good
2017-02-05 20:58:59	Yoshi2	it's little more than imgur screenshots I made thrown together with some blending though

2017-02-05 20:59:54	Yoshi2	also I did not adjust the banner for that TV layout youtube has
2017-02-05 21:01:44	Yoshi2	or I kinda did and it looks horrible
2017-02-05 21:09:23	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-02-05 21:10:36	Yoshi2	i don't even know how to access the TV layout
2017-02-05 21:10:40	Yoshi2	so I'm probably fine for now

2017-02-06 19:34:05	Testyo	This will be taken straight from one of the Pikmin games
2017-02-06 19:56:24	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-06 19:57:48	Yoshi2	I finished the animation thing for one character https://i.imgur.com/3mByBkx.gif
2017-02-06 19:58:09	Yoshi2	probably won't do it for the rest because it is rather time consuming
2017-02-06 19:59:09	@Espyo	I bet it was
2017-02-06 20:01:49	@J	it's a shame gif only has 1-bit transparency

2017-02-06 20:08:09	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-06 20:08:23	Yoshi2	I have this as APNG but that sadly didn't become popular
2017-02-06 20:10:14	@Espyo	yeah...
2017-02-06 20:14:55	Yoshi2	I actually spent the longest time figuring out how to make the APNG into a gif with transparency
2017-02-06 20:15:42	Yoshi2	my ffmpeg couldn't do transparency for some reason so I had to use imagemagick (also a cmd line program but with more options for making a gif)

2017-02-06 20:23:16	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-06 20:23:54	@J	probably better to just put a solid background colour on it
2017-02-06 20:24:19	@J	I have to say, I've never used ffmpeg for gifs
2017-02-06 20:43:55	Yoshi2	ffmpeg can do decent gifs with palettegen and paletteuse filters
2017-02-06 20:59:40	Yoshi2	i enjoyed this rip very much https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2oFfBNcQ_0
2017-02-06 21:00:06	@Espyo	oh yea
2017-02-06 21:00:10	@Espyo	*I've seen that one earlier today

2017-02-07 19:49:37	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-02-07 19:49:37	Testyo	so power regression would be trying curves like a*b^(c*x), where x is your total win percentage?
2017-02-07 19:49:55	Yoshi2	wow, you came online at the same time as I returned to my pc
2017-02-07 20:15:46	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-07 20:15:53	@Espyo	hmmmm, dunno if I should feel amused or stalked
2017-02-07 20:17:18	Yoshi2	don't worry i do that to a friend of mine too
2017-02-07 20:18:35	@Espyo	double the stalking, gotcha
2017-02-07 20:22:29	Yoshi2	also i am very annoyed how the shitposting channel on pnf404 is just a trump cesspit
2017-02-07 20:22:54	@Espyo	yeah, that's limited imagination if you ask me
2017-02-07 20:23:14	Yoshi2	i wonder if i should start posting schulz memes
2017-02-07 20:25:43	Yoshi2	or anti-trump memes
2017-02-07 20:31:57	@Espyo	be the change you want to see in the world
2017-02-07 20:32:05	@Espyo	post Mr. Bean shitposting
2017-02-07 20:47:30	Yoshi2	well it's not like i have anything to lose

2017-02-08 19:32:23	@Espyo	I remember reading this post's title on my feed
2017-02-08 19:32:34	@Espyo	pretty sure I just went "heh, I already know the answer. NONE."
2017-02-08 20:31:04	Yoshi2	i should add top-down model rendering to my bw editor
2017-02-08 20:31:13	Yoshi2	but that will slow it down even more
2017-02-08 20:32:15	@Espyo	yeah... :(
2017-02-08 20:32:37	Yoshi2	unless I make it a "generate top-down images of models"
2017-02-08 20:32:41	Yoshi2	thing
2017-02-08 20:33:08	Yoshi2	but I'd need a good format for that
2017-02-08 20:34:05	Yoshi2	idk if qt can do svg, that would be neat
2017-02-08 20:35:13	@Espyo	neat, but HEAVY
2017-02-08 20:35:49	Yoshi2	what other options do i have
2017-02-08 20:36:06	@Espyo	well, not doing it to begin with...
2017-02-08 20:36:13	Yoshi2	but
2017-02-08 20:36:15	Yoshi2	;-;
2017-02-08 20:36:38	Yoshi2	maybe only generate it for selected objects
2017-02-08 20:36:55	@Espyo	that sounds good, actually
2017-02-08 20:37:43	Yoshi2	but I still want to generate it for all objects because the user might select any object
2017-02-08 20:37:57	Yoshi2	and then load whatever is loaded
2017-02-08 20:38:39	Yoshi2	and there is still the question of how I do it
2017-02-08 20:39:58	Yoshi2	i do not want to re-render the thing in code every time so it would be good if it was pre-rendered

2017-02-08 20:40:41	@Espyo	one thing: is this for the map editor?
2017-02-08 20:40:47	Yoshi2	yes
2017-02-08 20:41:15	Yoshi2	being able to know what the object shapes are would be useful for moving stuff around
2017-02-08 20:43:57	@Espyo	ah, I getcha
2017-02-08 20:44:07	@Espyo	well... maybe make it just a global option?
2017-02-08 20:44:13	@Espyo	if your computer sucks, just turn it off entirely
2017-02-08 20:44:18	@Espyo	if you can handle it, turn it on entirely
2017-02-08 20:44:25	@Espyo	then it wouldn't be such a nightmare to implement
2017-02-08 20:44:35	@Espyo	(your computer = user's computer)
2017-02-08 20:44:54	Yoshi2	it will be an option anyway because the graphics are stored in a different file

2017-02-08 20:47:21	Yoshi2	and it's not just about whether the computer can handle it or not. Currently all rendering is done in code and it is not very fast
2017-02-08 20:48:43	@Espyo	still depends on the computer
2017-02-08 20:48:46	@Espyo	but I get what you mean

2017-02-08 20:51:16	Yoshi2	to an extent yes
2017-02-08 20:52:10	Yoshi2	but if I implement it poorly the difference between a slow and a fast computer will be "slow" and "a bit less slow"
2017-02-08 20:52:48	@Espyo	hehe yeah
2017-02-08 20:56:14	Yoshi2	I will have to prerender the objects as 2d pictures to have it be somewhat quick
2017-02-08 20:56:20	@Espyo	mhm
2017-02-08 20:56:24	@Espyo	but that'll increase load times
2017-02-08 21:00:24	Yoshi2	not if i store the generated pictures and load them when needed
2017-02-08 21:01:36	@Espyo	mhm
2017-02-08 21:01:41	@Espyo	but that'll increase disk usage
2017-02-08 21:05:09	Yoshi2	what if i add caching for recent pictures
2017-02-08 21:07:04	@Espyo	where'd you keep the cache? disk?
2017-02-08 21:07:32	Yoshi2	memory
2017-02-08 21:07:50	@Espyo	oh, yeah, sure
2017-02-08 21:08:00	@Espyo	I just meant that you'll still need some disk usage for keeping the pre-renders
2017-02-08 21:08:29	Yoshi2	sure
2017-02-08 21:08:41	@Espyo	in that case, sounds good
2017-02-08 21:10:55	Yoshi2	this is very catchy but also a bit lewd: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UpZnSjMko4
2017-02-08 21:12:37	@Espyo	hey, I can see the interpolation!
2017-02-08 21:12:45	@Espyo	and yeah, it's catchy
2017-02-08 21:13:38	Yoshi2	are you saying it isn't actually 60fps drawn
2017-02-08 21:13:45	Yoshi2	and most of the frames are interpolated
2017-02-08 21:13:52	@Espyo	that is, most indeed, what I'm saying
2017-02-08 21:14:01	Yoshi2	WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
2017-02-08 21:14:02	@Espyo	I love how 60fps interpolated is super hit-or-miss
2017-02-08 21:14:09	@Espyo	on some clips, it looks amazing
2017-02-08 21:14:11	Yoshi2	well they fooled me this time
2017-02-08 21:14:13	@Espyo	on others... motion sickness!
2017-02-08 21:15:34	Yoshi2	damnit now I cannot unsee the interpolation
2017-02-08 21:16:31	@Espyo	lol

2017-02-09 19:32:04	Marty2000	Hello Espyo and Testyo
2017-02-09 19:32:05	Testyo	is it weird that the only thing I remember from that boss is that makes sense.
2017-02-09 19:38:40	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-09 20:15:49	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-02-09 20:15:49	Testyo	I'm not seeing it all, I'm just PLAYED"
2017-02-09 20:15:56	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-09 20:53:47	Yoshi2	Espyo Marty2000 last chance, is there a reason to not buy facerig and become an anime character?
2017-02-09 20:55:45	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-02-09 20:55:51	@Espyo	does social standards count?
2017-02-09 20:56:31	Yoshi2	what are social standards
2017-02-09 20:56:51	@Espyo	that's the spirit
2017-02-09 20:57:20	Yoshi2	heh
2017-02-09 21:06:36	Yoshi2	ok i asked a couple of people I know and nobody had anything specific against it so woooooooooooooooooooo
2017-02-09 21:07:12	@Espyo	good enough
2017-02-09 21:12:37	Yoshi2	problem, only my desktop has enough HDD space but only my notebook has a webcam
2017-02-09 21:12:44	Yoshi2	let's combine the two
2017-02-09 21:19:46	Yoshi2	installing: step 11 of 17
2017-02-09 21:19:54	Yoshi2	dont do this to me, why did you get stuck
2017-02-09 21:20:32	@Espyo	it's just teasing
2017-02-09 21:29:48	Yoshi2	hmmmm
2017-02-09 21:32:26	Yoshi2	awww, this doesn't work properly over network sharing. It wants me to properly install the game
2017-02-09 21:36:19	Yoshi2	i will have to see if we still have that one webcam I remember seeing ages ago
2017-02-09 21:36:26	Yoshi2	or I will have to clean up on my notebook
2017-02-09 21:42:59	Yoshi2	found the webcam, ayy
2017-02-09 21:43:11	Yoshi2	time to check if it still works
2017-02-09 21:44:12	@Espyo	well, yeah, at first, I think you should just try it and see if it works
2017-02-09 21:44:17	@Espyo	then worry about disk space and quality webcams and all
2017-02-09 21:45:13	Yoshi2	oh my god it is blinking

2017-02-09 21:50:25	Marty2000	I am surprised you've answered me using my usual "arrogance", UltraMario. Why is that?
2017-02-09 21:50:32	UltraMario	wow
2017-02-09 21:52:01	Yoshi2	the camera works
2017-02-09 21:52:18	Yoshi2	tomorrow I will see if I can get facerig to work with this camera (first test didn't quite work out)

2017-02-10 20:09:51	Testyo	This entire opening ceremony could be like FUCK YOU
2017-02-10 20:11:18	Yoshi2	i have good news and bad news
2017-02-10 20:21:25	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-10 20:21:27	@Espyo	lemme guess
2017-02-10 20:21:37	@Espyo	you managed to setup the webcam
2017-02-10 20:21:40	@Espyo	but the program doesn't want any of it
2017-02-10 20:22:08	Yoshi2	the webcam works on the desktop and the program detects it
2017-02-10 20:22:34	Yoshi2	but the usb ports on my desktop are usb1.1 speeds for some reason and the webcam doesn't do more than 800x600 at 15 fps
2017-02-10 20:22:44	Yoshi2	with heavy mpeg artifacts
2017-02-10 20:22:52	@Espyo	ouch
2017-02-10 20:23:04	Yoshi2	so I've been looking for a way to fix that
2017-02-10 20:24:43	Yoshi2	it somewhat works but there's gotta be a way to fix these usb 1.1 speeds

2017-02-10 20:44:27	Yoshi2	I am testing a driver update on my vista because my vendor only has drivers for my pc for vista
2017-02-10 20:47:01	Yoshi2	driver update didn't do a damn fucking thing
2017-02-10 20:47:08	Yoshi2	then it must be a bios issue
2017-02-10 20:47:15	Yoshi2	bios likes to beep though
2017-02-10 20:47:19	Yoshi2	so I'm not doing it now
2017-02-10 20:48:35	@Espyo	woah, what
2017-02-10 20:52:54	Yoshi2	I tried updating the intel chipset
2017-02-10 20:56:31	Yoshi2	maybe I have legacy usb on
2017-02-10 20:56:52	Yoshi2	that probably causes these issues
2017-02-10 20:58:21	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-10 21:01:41	Yoshi2	IF I have it on
2017-02-10 21:02:11	Yoshi2	I don't remember very well and I am scared of checking it at night
2017-02-10 21:02:29	Yoshi2	because messing with bios on my desktop used to make the fan spin at 4000 RPM
2017-02-10 21:02:44	@Espyo	hmmm... that actually sounds kinda normal
2017-02-10 21:02:48	@Espyo	I mean, at least, I tried to imagine that happening
2017-02-10 21:02:53	@Espyo	and it didn't strike me as "this should never happen"
2017-02-10 21:02:59	@Espyo	maybe I've had some computers where that happened
2017-02-10 21:03:06	Yoshi2	for a short while, sure
2017-02-10 21:03:12	Yoshi2	BUT NOT PERMANENTLY
2017-02-10 21:03:17	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2017-02-10 21:03:42	Yoshi2	turns out specific fan settings + being careful makes it go away
2017-02-10 21:03:44	Yoshi2	i think

2017-02-10 21:24:54	Yoshi2|offline	a friend asked me to shitpost about martin schulz (social democrats candidate for chancellor in Germany) on /pol/ so I did that

2017-02-10 21:25:03	Yoshi2|offline	i never posted there before
2017-02-10 21:34:47	Yoshi2|offline	my friend would do it himself but he was banned from posting
2017-02-10 21:41:24	@Espyo	haha
2017-02-10 21:41:49	@Espyo	if your friend got banned from the biggest shit/pol/sting board in the world
2017-02-10 21:41:52	@Espyo	that has to say something
2017-02-10 21:42:24	Yoshi2|offline	no he got banned from posting in the whole of 4chan. Story is more boring than you'd expect
2017-02-10 21:48:05	Yoshi2|offline	posted a pizza joke in a cp thread and got caught in the collateral damage resulting from the janitors slamming the ban hammer on everything that moves in those threads
2017-02-10 21:49:34	@Espyo	what's he doing in cp threads anyway? >_>
2017-02-10 21:51:32	Yoshi2|offline	trolling i guess, to his defense nothing was posted at the time he wrote the joke

2017-02-11 13:10:14	Yoshi2	I managed to fix the usb issue
2017-02-11 13:10:30	Yoshi2	there was no legacy usb thing
2017-02-11 13:10:44	Yoshi2	instead, I had to update the bios which would add a USB 2.0 option
2017-02-11 13:13:28	Yoshi2	so now the camera can do 720p at 30 fps, weeee

2017-02-11 18:36:10	@Espyo	I haven't experienced any wireless one, but I've always had the idea that cheap wireless mice are just putrid ass, and good wireless mice are stupid expensive
2017-02-11 18:44:26	Yoshi2	seems about right
2017-02-11 18:44:45	@Espyo	ttthought so
2017-02-11 18:44:56	Yoshi2	the ones I bought were kinda alright but one had a double-click issue after a lot of minecraft use
2017-02-11 18:45:11	@Espyo	eugh
2017-02-11 18:45:47	Yoshi2	second one the rubber on the side started wearing off (maybe due to sweat) and eventually I lost its wireless connector
2017-02-11 18:46:06	@Espyo	literally making it useless?
2017-02-11 18:46:18	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-11 18:46:35	Yoshi2	I found the first one's connector but the two don't work together I think
2017-02-11 19:29:09	Yoshi2	it seems my next phone will PROBABLY be a oneplus 3t after all
2017-02-11 19:29:30	@Espyo	oh, speaking of, I bought a new one yesterday
2017-02-11 19:29:34	@Espyo	Wiko UFeel Lite
2017-02-11 19:29:38	@Espyo	it...seems okay
2017-02-11 19:29:48	@Espyo	aren't onepluses pretty expensive?
2017-02-11 19:30:04	Yoshi2	440€
2017-02-11 19:30:04	Testyo	440 € = £ 310.904  / $ 478.368 
2017-02-11 19:36:33	@Espyo	I'd say yes
2017-02-11 19:45:11	Yoshi2	it's slightly above mid-range for android phones
2017-02-11 19:45:48	Yoshi2	at the higher end you have samsung galaxy s7 and its edge version at 600-700 I think, and the pixel is also plenty expensive
2017-02-11 19:47:26	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-11 19:50:52	Yoshi2	my s2 was 400€ back then
2017-02-11 19:50:52	Testyo	400 € = £ 282.64  / $ 434.88 
2017-02-11 19:51:03	Yoshi2	(later it was sold for 300€ I think)
2017-02-11 19:51:04	Testyo	300 € = £ 211.98  / $ 326.16 
2017-02-11 19:51:08	Yoshi2	thank you Testyo 
2017-02-11 19:51:09	Testyo	and espy, thanks for posting the script, that splatfest
2017-02-11 19:51:20	Yoshi2	your script is a splatfest
2017-02-11 19:52:38	@Espyo	k
2017-02-11 19:56:01	Testyo	it's your hostname
2017-02-11 20:14:59	Yoshi2	http://www.viva64.com/media/images/content/b/0405_XRay/image3.png i think I just understood what this means
2017-02-11 20:16:31	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2017-02-11 20:16:37	@Espyo	wasn't that on something I linked some days ago?
2017-02-11 20:16:43	@Espyo	I STRONGLY remember seeing this
2017-02-11 20:16:47	@Espyo	maybe it was on r/ProgrammerHumor
2017-02-11 20:17:09	Yoshi2	yes it was on a thing you linked
2017-02-11 20:25:57	Yoshi2	I wonder what this music is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F30eTPamTNo
2017-02-11 20:32:03	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-02-11 20:36:12	Yoshi2	it sounds serious but I keep hearing "Riding my pony" and

2017-02-12 18:47:37	Testyo	YOU'D PROBABLY BE BETTER FUCKS SAKE
2017-02-12 18:47:45	Neocraftz1553	o dam
2017-02-12 18:47:48	Yoshi2	hi Neocraftz1553 
2017-02-12 18:47:56	Neocraftz1553	Hey Yoshi2
2017-02-12 18:57:44	@Espyo	hi Neocraftz1553
2017-02-12 18:57:50	@Espyo	hey, I've seen that gif you sent me the other day
2017-02-12 18:57:54	@Espyo	sorry I never replied, I was busy
2017-02-12 18:57:58	@Espyo	and you left when I was ready
2017-02-12 18:58:04	@Espyo	anyway, I'm not quite sure what is up with that
2017-02-12 18:58:08	@Espyo	but are other walls usually that broken?
2017-02-12 18:58:16	@Espyo	because it looked to me like the walls were working backwards
2017-02-12 18:58:21	@Espyo	you could fall "up", but not "down"
2017-02-12 18:59:33	Neocraftz1553	No
2017-02-12 18:59:46	@Espyo	weird
2017-02-12 18:59:49	@Espyo	can you reproduce it easily?
2017-02-12 18:59:52	Neocraftz1553	The other walls are either a-ok or you can just phase right through them
2017-02-12 18:59:58	Neocraftz1553	Hmm... not sure.
2017-02-12 19:00:03	@Espyo	oh, by "walls", I meant sector walls
2017-02-12 19:00:04	@Espyo	not gates
2017-02-12 19:00:07	Neocraftz1553	I can try right now, I have the engine open.
2017-02-12 19:00:10	Neocraftz1553	Ah
2017-02-12 19:04:53	@Espyo	well, if you can reproduce it, you can try sending me a small map that has that problem
2017-02-12 19:04:56	@Espyo	and I'll take a look
2017-02-12 19:05:08	Neocraftz1553	I can send you the current map.
2017-02-12 19:05:15	@Espyo	that works
2017-02-12 19:05:26	Neocraftz1553	It's strange. You go from a height of 0 to a height of 300.
2017-02-12 19:05:45	@Espyo	._.

2017-02-12 19:08:46	@Espyo	thanks
2017-02-12 19:09:56	Neocraftz1553	No prob
2017-02-12 19:11:36	@Espyo	all right, now, which of these 3 causes the problem?
2017-02-12 19:12:44	Neocraftz1553	The blue one.
2017-02-12 19:12:57	@Espyo	so, the one on the right?
2017-02-12 19:13:01	@Espyo	I don't have the files for blue gates
2017-02-12 19:13:04	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2017-02-12 19:13:05	@Espyo	but I probably won't need them anyway
2017-02-12 19:13:08	@Espyo	okay
2017-02-12 19:13:12	@Espyo	I can go through the middle one, though
2017-02-12 19:13:27	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, I couldn't get that one to work right...
2017-02-12 19:15:08	@Espyo	ok, the thing with the first gate is that the sector the gate makes up needs to be of the "Gate" type :P
2017-02-12 19:15:16	@Espyo	I mean, the central gate
2017-02-12 19:16:18	@Espyo	and yeah... I can reproduce the glitch where you go through the wall from 0 to 300
2017-02-12 19:16:21	Neocraftz1553	Welp...
2017-02-12 19:16:35	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, I just tried it with a White Bramble Gate
2017-02-12 19:18:21	Neocraftz1553	Huh, I never would've guessed that I forgot to make it a "gate" sector.
2017-02-12 19:18:38	Neocraftz1553	I swear I set it to that more than twice...
2017-02-12 19:19:39	@Espyo	lol
2017-02-12 19:22:15	@Espyo	hmm, it only happens if there's a gate on the sector
2017-02-12 19:22:18	@Espyo	otherwise it acts just fine
2017-02-12 19:22:36	Neocraftz1553	strange
2017-02-12 19:22:45	Neocraftz1553	Maybe you teleport to the top of the gate...?
2017-02-12 19:22:59	@Espyo	shouldn't be, since they're not really meant to have collision...
2017-02-12 19:24:17	Neocraftz1553	It doesn't work with electric fe- oh wait nevermind...
2017-02-12 19:28:55	Neocraftz1553	Well, I've gotten myself stuck on a... non... gate sector...?
2017-02-12 19:28:56	Neocraftz1553	http://imgur.com/a/kVgMc
2017-02-12 19:30:02	@Espyo	yeah, that thing is just glitchy all around
2017-02-12 19:30:04	@Espyo	I need to figure out why
2017-02-12 19:30:56	Neocraftz1553	Kill it
2017-02-12 19:30:59	Neocraftz1553	Kill it with fire
2017-02-12 19:31:14	@Espyo	ye
2017-02-12 20:01:40	@Espyo	ok, it happens so long as the gate is in the sector
2017-02-12 20:01:43	@Espyo	the sector can be MASSIVE
2017-02-12 20:01:48	@Espyo	and Olimar can be very far away from the gate
2017-02-12 20:01:57	@Espyo	but just because the gate is there, it'll still cause the glitch
2017-02-12 20:03:10	@Espyo	well, I'll take a deeper look later
2017-02-12 20:03:13	@Espyo	but it shouldn't be so hard
2017-02-12 20:03:14	Neocraftz1553	huh
2017-02-12 20:22:18	Neocraftz1553	Hey, Espyo
2017-02-12 20:22:27	Neocraftz1553	You know the Rust Yard map?
2017-02-12 20:22:32	Neocraftz1553	I added in Bulbmin.
2017-02-12 20:23:20	Neocraftz1553	http://imgur.com/Yle3dfO
2017-02-12 20:27:43	Neocraftz1553	I just need to work on the Pikmin icon and it's throw animation.
2017-02-12 20:48:49	@Espyo	awesome!
2017-02-12 20:50:06	@Espyo	also, from what I saw in the image, it looks neat, but it could use some variation
2017-02-12 20:50:11	@Espyo	Scruffy made a rust-like map too
2017-02-12 20:50:18	@Espyo	but he varied it a bit by adding some sand parts and such
2017-02-12 20:50:34	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2017-02-12 20:51:30	Neocraftz1553	I'm mostly using it for testing purposes, each "Island" is connected with bridges, and each island is either a placeholder or contains an enemy/Pikmin type.
2017-02-12 20:51:41	@Espyo	ah, okay
2017-02-12 20:51:47	@Espyo	can you let me know later if that works okay?
2017-02-12 20:51:59	@Espyo	I've always wondered if it was possible to have islands connected by bridges, and bottomless pits below
2017-02-12 20:52:00	Neocraftz1553	I put all the Onions in such a way so that they overlap each other, so it acts like the Master Onion from P3
2017-02-12 20:52:08	Neocraftz1553	Sure
2017-02-12 20:52:10	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, it works.
2017-02-12 20:52:14	Neocraftz1553	Just...
2017-02-12 20:52:28	@Espyo	heh, that's a funny idea
2017-02-12 20:52:34	@Espyo	but I'll add a master Onion one day, no worries
2017-02-12 20:52:47	Neocraftz1553	Don't make a bottomless bridge all around it if you're still adding sectors.
2017-02-12 20:52:53	Neocraftz1553	It freaks out.
2017-02-12 20:53:05	@Espyo	all around the bridge, or all around the island?
2017-02-12 20:53:19	Neocraftz1553	All around the map.
2017-02-12 20:53:23	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-12 20:53:24	@Espyo	hmm...
2017-02-12 20:53:33	@Espyo	wait, a bottomless BRIDGE?
2017-02-12 20:53:40	Neocraftz1553	...
2017-02-12 20:53:50	Neocraftz1553	a bottomless pit.
2017-02-12 20:53:55	@Espyo	oh lol
2017-02-12 20:53:59	@Espyo	hmm, weird
2017-02-12 20:54:02	@Espyo	it should work fine
2017-02-12 20:54:08	Neocraftz1553	eh, I get why
2017-02-12 20:54:16	Neocraftz1553	If you put the sectors like... err.
2017-02-12 20:54:24	Neocraftz1553	O---O
2017-02-12 20:54:34	Neocraftz1553	|xxx|
2017-02-12 20:54:40	Neocraftz1553	O---O
2017-02-12 20:55:05	Neocraftz1553	Where O = an island and -/| = the bridges connecting them
2017-02-12 20:55:48	Neocraftz1553	Since the Bottomless pit gets cut off by the added bridge, the engine know that's not supposed to happen.
2017-02-12 20:55:54	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2017-02-12 20:56:01	@Espyo	that's because it stops being one sector and becomes two
2017-02-12 20:56:08	@Espyo	but you never told the engine that it's now two sectors
2017-02-12 20:56:11	Neocraftz1553	But if you /do/ want it to be like that, you have to remove the pit.
2017-02-12 20:56:30	Neocraftz1553	I dun goofed on that part, so I had to reload the back up.
2017-02-12 20:56:35	Neocraftz1553	Saved my life.
2017-02-12 20:56:47	@Espyo	good to know the backups are useful
2017-02-12 20:57:00	@Espyo	I was so scared of people destroying their maps because the area editor is a bit short-tempered
2017-02-12 20:57:05	@Espyo	and fixing the short-temperedness is super hard...
2017-02-12 20:57:16	Neocraftz1553	lol
2017-02-12 20:57:34	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, they come in handy
2017-02-12 20:59:49	Neocraftz1553	Eh, it's coming along alright... http://imgur.com/iIQ5vOj
2017-02-12 20:59:57	Neocraftz1553	My art skills aren't the best, though.
2017-02-12 21:00:13	@Espyo	seems good enough to me
2017-02-12 21:00:22	@Espyo	for now, of course
2017-02-12 21:00:39	@Espyo	oh, remember that the HUD icons are different now
2017-02-12 21:00:40	Neocraftz1553	heh
2017-02-12 21:00:43	@Espyo	all the Pikmin are facing the right
2017-02-12 21:00:50	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2017-02-12 21:00:53	@Espyo	since Bulbmin have such a different physique, it's fine if they're not quite the same
2017-02-12 21:00:56	Neocraftz1553	I plan on flipping it once I'm done
2017-02-12 21:01:00	@Espyo	but... at least having them face the same way would be nice :P
2017-02-12 21:01:17	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2017-02-12 21:01:31	Neocraftz1553	Gotta keep things orderly.
2017-02-12 21:02:04	Neocraftz1553	I wonder...
2017-02-12 21:02:15	Neocraftz1553	Is it possible to put Bulbmin into Pikmin 3?
2017-02-12 21:04:24	@Espyo	probably not
2017-02-12 21:04:27	@Espyo	although
2017-02-12 21:04:29	@Espyo	their models are in the game
2017-02-12 21:04:32	@Espyo	ports from Pikmin 2
2017-02-12 21:04:34	@Espyo	but no other data is
2017-02-12 21:05:10	Neocraftz1553	Hm...
2017-02-12 21:05:30	Neocraftz1553	Maybe they were going to be added in, and then stored in the ship like in Pikmin 2.
2017-02-12 21:05:48	Neocraftz1553	Or maybe they were going to be Challenge mode-only, much like White and Purples.
2017-02-12 21:06:19	Neocraftz1553	Then again, the devs could've just started with the old models and worked their way from there.
2017-02-12 21:06:28	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-12 21:06:48	Neocraftz1553	Still, I'd like to see them in the future.
2017-02-12 21:07:01	@Espyo	yeah

2017-02-12 21:44:31	Neocraftz1553	I closed this tab by accident.
2017-02-12 21:44:53	Neocraftz1553	Eh, not the best icon in the world, but it works: http://imgur.com/dET4Ji2

2017-02-12 21:49:29	@Espyo	yeah, it works
2017-02-12 21:54:04	Neocraftz1553	Erm, Espyo?
2017-02-12 21:54:14	Neocraftz1553	Is there a way for mobs to detect sector types?
2017-02-12 21:54:17	@Espyo	nope
2017-02-12 21:54:22	Neocraftz1553	Like Gates, Pits, etc.
2017-02-12 21:54:24	@Espyo	although, what exactly do you mean?
2017-02-12 21:55:33	Neocraftz1553	Well, it'd be useful to have "always active ground" mobs to check for bottomless pits every few ticks, and if they get too close, they either head back home or they move away from it.
2017-02-12 21:55:43	Neocraftz1553	Because currently, well...
2017-02-12 21:55:57	Neocraftz1553	The Dwarf red bulborbs are taking a nosedive into the pits.
2017-02-12 21:57:38	@Espyo	HAHA
2017-02-12 21:58:09	@Espyo	heh, I gotta do something about it...
2017-02-12 21:58:16	@Espyo	though I don't think there's anything like that in the canon games
2017-02-12 21:58:22	@Espyo	since you can coax enemies into falling off easily
2017-02-12 21:58:31	@Espyo	the developers just have to be careful about not putting them near pits...
2017-02-12 21:58:35	@Espyo	but I'll see if I can do something
2017-02-12 21:58:52	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok
2017-02-12 21:58:53	Neocraftz1553	thanks
2017-02-12 22:04:13	Neocraftz1553	I might make a simple tutorial for the engine on how to make areas.
2017-02-12 22:04:34	Neocraftz1553	It'll go with the reddit post.
2017-02-12 22:05:19	Neocraftz1553	 /Maybe/ it can inspire some to make their own fangames, but we'll see.
2017-02-12 22:08:09	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-12 22:08:19	@Espyo	though I'd prefer the engine to gain more popularity when it's more mature
2017-02-12 22:08:29	@Espyo	I don't need little kids asking me "can I create Pikmin 3 in this?" over and over again
2017-02-12 22:08:38	@Espyo	and I don't want this to be too popular, otherwise Nintendo might take a look...
2017-02-12 22:10:12	Neocraftz1553	True
2017-02-12 22:10:17	Neocraftz1553	But can I create Pikmin 3 in this?
2017-02-12 22:13:15	Neocraftz1553	jk
2017-02-12 22:13:23	Neocraftz1553	 /Maybe/ if you try hard enough you can make Pikmin 1.
2017-02-12 22:13:37	Neocraftz1553	It'll still be missing a few aspects, though.
2017-02-12 22:14:36	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, brb in aboout an hour.

2017-02-13 20:20:13	Testyo	So I stumble across it
2017-02-13 20:20:19	Neocraftz1553	mhmm
2017-02-13 20:20:27	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, hey Yoshi2
2017-02-13 20:21:05	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-13 20:21:15	Yoshi2	hi neocraftz
2017-02-13 20:27:55	Neocraftz1553	I'm almost fully done with the Bulbmin's animations.
2017-02-13 20:28:24	Neocraftz1553	I just need to make a throw animation for them. Currently they magically turn into Cyan Pikmin in mid-air.
2017-02-13 20:28:42	@Espyo	hah
2017-02-13 21:21:52	Yoshi2	Espyo: whelp, I guess I have to make my own version of the music piece without the intro
2017-02-13 21:34:15	Neocraftz1553	Yay
2017-02-13 21:34:24	Neocraftz1553	I finally got the Bulbmin throw animation to work

2017-02-13 21:35:55	Yoshi2	good video but i'm against yt intros in music :P
2017-02-13 21:36:29	Neocraftz1553	Heh, a comment there says: "I'm scared this is resurfacing my addiction for Pikmin﻿"
2017-02-13 21:36:35	Neocraftz1553	Don't fight it :p
2017-02-13 21:44:49	@Espyo	guess so
2017-02-13 21:44:58	@Espyo	nice, Neo
2017-02-13 21:45:23	Neocraftz1553	Tanks
2017-02-13 21:55:49	Yoshi2	WHAT THE HECK all i want to do is to merge this pic with this audio but it doesn't freaking work
2017-02-13 21:56:25	Yoshi2	it shouldn't even be difficult, I did it before
2017-02-13 21:57:10	@Espyo	whaa?
2017-02-13 21:57:14	@Espyo	you're trying to do WHAT now?
2017-02-13 21:57:42	Neocraftz1553	so...
2017-02-13 21:57:49	Neocraftz1553	You can hear the picture, right?
2017-02-13 21:58:06	Neocraftz1553	Cool, I'd like to hear what red sounds like.
2017-02-13 21:58:40	Neocraftz1553	Or I'd like to hear what a Piano key sound looks like.
2017-02-13 21:59:59	Neocraftz1553	Hey, Espyo, Blox9000 thV amaving gas pivpe wants to know if it would be possible to add in circle, triangle, and square tools into the engine, for the map editor.
2017-02-13 22:00:24	@Espyo	ehrm, well...
2017-02-13 22:00:29	@Espyo	yeah, but how useful would they really be?
2017-02-13 22:00:34	@Espyo	circles, I can get
2017-02-13 22:00:37	Neocraftz1553	'cause, like, rip my tree trunk :P
2017-02-13 22:00:44	Neocraftz1553	I dunno
2017-02-13 22:00:45	@Espyo	triangles and squares are done super easily though
2017-02-13 22:01:02	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2017-02-13 22:01:19	Neocraftz1553	Is it possible, though?
2017-02-13 22:01:23	@Espyo	yes
2017-02-13 22:01:30	Neocraftz1553	Ah, ok
2017-02-13 22:01:40	@Espyo	I can add circle support, but I don't want to waste time doing the others, since they'll barely be useful
2017-02-13 22:01:49	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2017-02-13 22:03:31	Neocraftz1553	Ok, thanks
2017-02-13 22:10:12	Neocraftz1553	Aha
2017-02-13 22:10:45	Neocraftz1553	So, you know the temperature mechanic I'm working on, right?
2017-02-13 22:11:04	@Espyo	yeah?
2017-02-13 22:11:13	Neocraftz1553	I think it should work with the weather.
2017-02-13 22:11:21	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-13 22:11:24	Neocraftz1553	So each weather has it's own temperature.
2017-02-13 22:11:27	@Espyo	definitely
2017-02-13 22:11:34	Neocraftz1553	Hmm.
2017-02-13 22:12:03	Neocraftz1553	But then again, I can make it so that the editor can assign different temperatures to different sectors...
2017-02-13 22:12:17	@Espyo	eeeeehhhh...
2017-02-13 22:12:23	@Espyo	sounds like overengineering to me
2017-02-13 22:12:24	Neocraftz1553	So you can do something like a warm cave and a cold, well, outdoors.
2017-02-13 22:12:33	@Espyo	weather and temperatures are already niche details
2017-02-13 22:12:34	Neocraftz1553	But that might be too tedious .-.
2017-02-13 22:12:38	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-13 22:12:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2017-02-13 22:12:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2017-02-13 22:12:48	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-13 22:12:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2017-02-13 22:13:01	@Espyo	etc.
2017-02-13 22:13:09	Neocraftz1553	heh
2017-02-13 22:13:18	Neocraftz1553	Eh, I'll try out the weather.
2017-02-13 22:13:28	Neocraftz1553	Of course, it won't do anything yet.
2017-02-13 22:13:30	Neocraftz1553	yet.
2017-02-13 22:13:55	Neocraftz1553	Maybe it'll freeze water, and, err...
2017-02-13 22:14:13	Neocraftz1553	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-02-13 22:14:26	Neocraftz1553	Can't think of anything else.
2017-02-13 22:14:44	Neocraftz1553	Maybe snow, but it might be resource-intensive.
2017-02-13 22:14:50	Neocraftz1553	(or something like that)
2017-02-13 22:14:58	@Espyo	snow should be tied to the weather
2017-02-13 22:15:07	@Espyo	but I haven't implemented precipitation yet
2017-02-13 22:15:07	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2017-02-13 22:15:18	Neocraftz1553	The weather and precipitation.
2017-02-13 22:15:37	Neocraftz1553	how /should/ precipitation work...?
2017-02-13 22:15:53	@Espyo	you define what the particles look like
2017-02-13 22:16:00	@Espyo	how many of them should appear per second
2017-02-13 22:16:03	@Espyo	and that should be it
2017-02-13 22:16:18	@Espyo	the engine just spawns particles on top of everything, going from one direction to the next, and despawns them when off-camera
2017-02-13 22:16:25	@Espyo	that's my plan anyway
2017-02-13 22:16:27	@Espyo	might end up ugly
2017-02-13 22:16:45	@Espyo	since rain doesn't fall perfectly vertically, I can do some horizontal movement and still keep it convincing
2017-02-13 22:17:07	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2017-02-13 22:17:26	Neocraftz1553	Let me make a quick mock-up...
2017-02-13 22:23:12	Neocraftz1553	So something like this, right? http://imgur.com/rw1o4Ny
2017-02-13 22:25:33	@Espyo	yeah, except not the size of a banana :|
2017-02-13 22:25:49	Neocraftz1553	lol
2017-02-13 22:27:14	Neocraftz1553	You mean something more like this: http://imgur.com/ll6Hor5
2017-02-13 22:27:29	Neocraftz1553	Except, y'know, not on top of the HUD.
2017-02-13 22:28:08	@Espyo	exactly
2017-02-13 22:28:24	@Espyo	looks convincing to me
2017-02-13 22:29:37	Neocraftz1553	So, err, nectar still doesn't work...?
2017-02-13 22:29:51	@Espyo	nope
2017-02-13 22:30:19	Neocraftz1553	Hmm...
2017-02-13 22:30:50	Neocraftz1553	Didn't it work in earlier versions, or...?
2017-02-13 22:31:38	@Espyo	I don't remember...
2017-02-13 22:33:07	Neocraftz1553	Also, what happened to the Pikmin noise when they're carrying something?
2017-02-13 22:33:18	Neocraftz1553	It makes the map less lonely.
2017-02-13 22:33:22	@Espyo	yeah, that was a weird circumstance
2017-02-13 22:33:37	@Espyo	like, it worked okay in the most simple case, of Pikmin carrying an object
2017-02-13 22:33:50	@Espyo	but if you have multiple carriers, or a Pikmin gets eaten, or you called enough to drop the object, or...
2017-02-13 22:33:54	@Espyo	then it would just glitch the sound out
2017-02-13 22:34:06	Neocraftz1553	Hmm... strange.
2017-02-13 22:34:08	@Espyo	I chose to take it out instead, and re-implement it in full force when I make a robust sound system
2017-02-13 22:34:51	Neocraftz1553	Shouldn't it work if you make the object being carried make the sound whenever it has enough pikmin to carry it?
2017-02-13 22:35:00	Neocraftz1553	Then again, that comes with problems of it's own.
2017-02-13 22:35:01	@Espyo	that's my plan
2017-02-13 22:35:08	@Espyo	but the old way wasn't anywhere near that
2017-02-13 22:38:34	Neocraftz1553	Ah, good to see treasures work.
2017-02-13 22:39:02	@Espyo	yeah, they should be just about flawless now
2017-02-13 22:42:07	Neocraftz1553	Hmm
2017-02-13 22:43:00	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin don't seem to know how to insert Enemies into the Ship yet, though.
2017-02-13 22:43:08	@Espyo	oh, no, they don't
2017-02-13 22:43:20	@Espyo	I'll add it to the todo
2017-02-13 22:43:32	Neocraftz1553	Maybe they should default their spoils to the ship if no onions are existent on the map...?
2017-02-13 22:43:52	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-13 22:44:57	Neocraftz1553	"and it works, very barebones, but it does"
2017-02-13 22:45:07	Neocraftz1553	I think you meant aesthetically...?
2017-02-13 22:46:03	@Espyo	where?
2017-02-13 22:46:27	Neocraftz1553	about a year ago.
2017-02-13 22:46:47	Neocraftz1553	 2015-12-26 00:35:51	@Espyo	and it works, very barebones, but it does
2017-02-13 22:47:07	@Espyo	uhm, okay
2017-02-13 22:47:09	@Espyo	but in regards to what?
2017-02-13 22:47:51	Neocraftz1553	To me asking about nectar
2017-02-13 22:48:08	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-13 22:48:09	@Espyo	lol
2017-02-13 22:48:11	Neocraftz1553	Erm, let me see...
2017-02-13 22:48:13	@Espyo	oh well
2017-02-13 22:48:17	Neocraftz1553	No, me asking you about maturity.
2017-02-13 22:48:22	@Espyo	I honestly don't remember what state it was at at the time
2017-02-13 22:48:41	Neocraftz1553	Erm, 0.7 I think, somewhere around that
2017-02-13 22:48:53	Neocraftz1553	I don't think it worked back then either, though, I don't think so.
2017-02-13 22:49:27	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-02-13 22:49:33	@Espyo	well, gonna take a look at your gate glitch now
2017-02-13 22:50:22	Neocraftz1553	Oh man, the Fog weather type goes really well with the Rust Yard map.
2017-02-13 22:50:50	@Espyo	hehe
2017-02-13 22:50:56	@Espyo	I'm glad it does
2017-02-13 22:51:06	@Espyo	it's such a simple effect, that I was worried it wouldn't work all that well
2017-02-13 22:54:10	@Espyo	ehrm
2017-02-13 22:54:20	@Espyo	I found the problem
2017-02-13 22:54:49	@Espyo	if, in the editor, the sector is marked as normal, then the engine checks if it should bother checking for collisions
2017-02-13 22:54:59	@Espyo	since the sector was at ground-level with your other sector, the engine just decided "no"
2017-02-13 22:55:08	@Espyo	but then all of a sudden, the gate comes in, and changes the sector to be blocking
2017-02-13 22:55:18	@Espyo	but the engine still firmly believes it shouldn't bother
2017-02-13 22:55:21	@Espyo	so that's why you can go through
2017-02-13 22:55:42	Neocraftz1553	Ah
2017-02-13 22:55:43	@Espyo	eeeh... I don't know if I should add support for this...
2017-02-13 22:55:58	Neocraftz1553	Maybe later
2017-02-13 22:56:07	Neocraftz1553	Unless you get, like, tons of reports on this.
2017-02-13 22:56:12	@Espyo	yeah... technically, the engine isn't doing anything wrong
2017-02-13 22:56:20	@Espyo	it's the map designer's fault for not declaring stuff right :P
2017-02-13 22:56:31	@Espyo	either way, I plan on deprecating the "gate" sector type some day
2017-02-13 22:56:40	@Espyo	I'll try to make it so the gate itself pushes others off
2017-02-13 22:56:43	@Espyo	instead of relying on a sector
2017-02-13 22:57:03	Neocraftz1553	That would make it easier to add them in.
2017-02-13 22:57:18	@Espyo	very
2017-02-13 22:57:26	@Espyo	still, I'll remove the "gate" sector type for now
2017-02-13 22:57:35	@Espyo	and make it so that gates only work if the sector they're on is of the "blocking" type
2017-02-13 22:57:44	@Espyo	since blocking and gate are pretty much exactly the same in the engine
2017-02-13 22:58:16	Neocraftz1553	Also, why do Pikmin only attack the Gate's radius instead of it's hitboxes?
2017-02-13 22:59:27	@Espyo	checking for hitboxes is expensive
2017-02-13 22:59:38	@Espyo	so I made it so they only look for the radius
2017-02-13 22:59:45	@Espyo	hitboxes only come into play when throwing
2017-02-13 22:59:48	@Espyo	since I have no choice there
2017-02-13 23:00:01	@Espyo	it looks a bit weird, but it's not THAT weird, so I left it like that
2017-02-13 23:00:38	Neocraftz1553	Eh, it's ok for now.
2017-02-13 23:01:09	Neocraftz1553	The 48 range radius that comes pre packaged, though, looks wierd weird
2017-02-13 23:01:20	@Espyo	it has to be big enough to poke outside of the sector...
2017-02-13 23:01:25	Neocraftz1553	Pikmin attack from a distance instead of coming into contact
2017-02-13 23:01:30	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-13 23:02:48	Neocraftz1553	I have no trouble with a 32 range radius, though
2017-02-13 23:03:05	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-13 23:03:14	@Espyo	I'll try resizing it a bit then
2017-02-13 23:03:19	@Espyo	I still want it to be big
2017-02-13 23:03:38	@Espyo	so that people don't have to draw their sector to the exact pixel, in fear that it won't match the gate
2017-02-13 23:05:21	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, I just tried it on the Play map
2017-02-13 23:05:23	Neocraftz1553	It works.
2017-02-13 23:05:35	@Espyo	okay then
2017-02-13 23:05:40	@Espyo	I'll try it
2017-02-13 23:05:41	@Espyo	thanks
2017-02-13 23:05:57	Neocraftz1553	No prob
2017-02-13 23:07:58	Yoshi2	i give up on my video thing, for some reason it doesn't want to work properly :(
2017-02-13 23:08:36	@Espyo	try again tomorrow and it'll magically work
2017-02-13 23:09:10	Yoshi2	i just wanted to take a picture and a music piece and make it into a video but either it doesn't play properly when longer than 20 seconds (MPC-HC) or music plays but no picture (every other player)
2017-02-13 23:09:27	Neocraftz1553	Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over hoping for a different outcome
2017-02-13 23:09:46	Yoshi2	except it works
2017-02-13 23:09:47	Neocraftz1553	Then again, it usually works with computers.
2017-02-13 23:10:02	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-13 23:10:13	@Espyo	tried a different encoder?
2017-02-13 23:10:14	Neocraftz1553	"My code doesn't work, I have no idea why" "My code works, I have no idea why"
2017-02-13 23:11:46	Yoshi2	i refuse to use any encoder other than ffmpeg (heck some free ones are ffmpeg-based anyway)
2017-02-13 23:12:06	@Espyo	heh, all right
2017-02-13 23:12:11	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2017-02-13 23:12:19	@Espyo	oh, I thought a radius of 32 would be JUST at the edge of the gate's graphics
2017-02-13 23:12:21	Yoshi2|offline	worst part is I got this to work once before
2017-02-13 23:12:24	@Espyo	but it's actually a fair bit after that
2017-02-13 23:12:25	@Espyo	my bad
2017-02-13 23:12:28	@Espyo	yeah, 32 seems cool
2017-02-13 23:12:40	@Espyo	that's what I'm telling you man, go sleep, come back tomorrow, and it'll work again
2017-02-13 23:12:58	Neocraftz1553	'Night, Yoshi2
2017-02-13 23:15:18	Neocraftz1553	Hey, Espyo
2017-02-13 23:15:35	Neocraftz1553	Wait, nevermind.
2017-02-13 23:22:10	Neocraftz1553	Hmm, I just had an idea for the engine...
2017-02-13 23:22:14	Neocraftz1553	What about height fog?
2017-02-13 23:22:21	Neocraftz1553	Or something of the like
2017-02-13 23:22:50	Neocraftz1553	For example, let's say you're on a +1000 or so sector, for some reason.
2017-02-13 23:23:55	Neocraftz1553	If a sector that's >200 appears, a small bit of fog get's rendered on it.
2017-02-13 23:24:11	Neocraftz1553	The lower the sector is, the more opaque the fog would look.
2017-02-13 23:24:17	@Espyo	yeah, I can see it
2017-02-13 23:24:22	@Espyo	I've thought about something of the sort before
2017-02-13 23:24:30	@Espyo	but having to color in every sector around is probably expensive
2017-02-13 23:24:40	Neocraftz1553	true
2017-02-13 23:24:42	@Espyo	plus, height is meant to be kept to a minimum
2017-02-13 23:25:01	@Espyo	if in a map it's hard to distinguish really tall sectors from really short ones, it's not so much a fault of the engine as it is a fault of the map...
2017-02-13 23:25:07	@Espyo	a map like that has no place being in a game like this...
2017-02-13 23:25:10	@Espyo	it's complicated
2017-02-13 23:25:13	Neocraftz1553	(unless you're me, then you have +5000 and -2000 sectors everywhere)
2017-02-13 23:25:15	@Espyo	but that's actually a nice suggestion
2017-02-13 23:25:19	@Espyo	I'll add it to a list of notes somewhere
2017-02-13 23:25:29	@Espyo	and if I need to rethink this in the future, I'll try to base myself on that idea
2017-02-13 23:25:29	@Espyo	thanks
2017-02-13 23:25:39	Neocraftz1553	No prob
2017-02-13 23:25:44	@Espyo	if you fall from a 5000 to a -2000, how many hours does it take you to land?
2017-02-13 23:25:55	Neocraftz1553	I dunno.
2017-02-13 23:25:58	Neocraftz1553	I could check.
2017-02-13 23:26:04	Neocraftz1553	Probably in around 5 seconds.
2017-02-13 23:26:15	@Espyo	heh
2017-02-13 23:26:29	Neocraftz1553	wow
2017-02-13 23:26:32	Neocraftz1553	I guessed about right
2017-02-13 23:26:34	Neocraftz1553	 4 seconds
2017-02-13 23:27:18	Neocraftz1553	It's cool to see Olimar shrink as he falls
2017-02-13 23:27:32	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-02-13 23:27:41	@Espyo	that shrinkage is meant to accompany the current leader
2017-02-13 23:27:45	@Espyo	such that the current leader never shrinks
2017-02-13 23:27:53	@Espyo	it's like the "camera" is always following it
2017-02-13 23:28:06	Neocraftz1553	ah
2017-02-13 23:28:21	@Espyo	uh... by which I mean, he shouldn't be shrinking :|
2017-02-13 23:28:53	Neocraftz1553	So he should be staying the same size...?

2017-02-13 23:31:28	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-02-13 23:31:31	@Espyo	maybe I coded it wrong :|
2017-02-13 23:31:39	@Espyo	and the "camera" is just based on Z of 0
2017-02-13 23:31:41	@Espyo	instead of the leader's Z

2017-02-14 23:07:35	@Espyo	also, *wow*
2017-02-14 23:07:47	@Espyo	I searched on google for "trademark symbol", so I could copy the TM
2017-02-14 23:07:51	Neocraftz1553	lol
2017-02-14 23:07:57	@Espyo	then I tried searching for "soon", and it autocompleted "soon tm"
2017-02-14 23:08:03	@Espyo	even though that's NOT normally the first autocompletion
2017-02-14 23:08:11	@Espyo	it knows
2017-02-14 23:08:17	@Espyo	it has grasped the concept of CONTEXT
2017-02-14 23:09:03	Neocraftz1553	Has technology gone too far?
2017-02-14 23:09:18	@Espyo	experts say YES
2017-02-14 23:09:41	Neocraftz1553	I'm an expert.
2017-02-14 23:09:44	Neocraftz1553	I say nay
2017-02-14 23:09:47	@Espyo	:O
2017-02-14 23:10:11	Neocraftz1553	ugh
2017-02-14 23:10:15	Neocraftz1553	I made Green Pikmin

2017-02-14 23:10:28	Neocraftz1553	But I forgot to make an Onion.
2017-02-14 23:10:56	@Espyo	did it crash?
2017-02-14 23:10:57	Neocraftz1553	That had me confused for 5 minutes more than I should've

2017-02-15 20:32:45	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-02-15 20:32:46	Testyo	mate, I'd love to have Lissa around in the real world, even if it's just for Luigi's Mansion
2017-02-15 20:33:05	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-15 20:33:12	@Espyo	Testyo...
2017-02-15 20:33:13	Testyo	what if the first game to truly immerse me was Super Mario Sunshine
2017-02-15 20:33:22	@Espyo	what if?
2017-02-15 21:33:56	Yoshi2	ordered that phone now, estimated delivery is by next week
2017-02-15 21:34:04	Yoshi2	nicu
2017-02-15 21:34:05	@Espyo	hey, not bad
2017-02-15 21:34:10	Yoshi2	my FE waifus will be miiiiine
2017-02-15 21:34:28	Yoshi2	also linfan is a cutie indeed
2017-02-15 21:35:56	@Espyo	Linfan... let's see...
2017-02-15 21:36:08	@Espyo	err
2017-02-15 21:36:11	@Espyo	the Spanish name for Morgan?
2017-02-15 21:36:35	@Espyo	sorry, *French
2017-02-15 21:36:42	@Espyo	wait, French AND Spanish
2017-02-15 21:36:53	@Espyo	and German
2017-02-15 21:36:55	@Espyo	and Italian
2017-02-15 21:37:11	@Espyo	yes, she's a damn cutie
2017-02-15 21:37:54	Yoshi2	basically every language except English? Interesting
2017-02-15 21:38:15	@Espyo	and Japanese, Mark
2017-02-15 21:40:02	Yoshi2	I guess at some point the EU translation teams came together and said
2017-02-15 21:40:46	Yoshi2	"Ok guys, "Morgan" and "Mark" are bad names for a localization of this character. Let's come up with a new name that everybody is happy with!" 
2017-02-15 21:41:22	Yoshi2	and they saw a drunk guy mispronounce something and said "yes that will do"
2017-02-15 21:41:27	@Espyo	lol yeah
2017-02-15 21:41:30	@Espyo	well, Morgan is pretty English
2017-02-15 21:41:31	@Espyo	so's Mark
2017-02-15 21:41:53	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-15 21:41:56	@Espyo	and eeeeh, having to come up with a name that's unisex for all languages is a chore
2017-02-15 21:41:59	@Espyo	let's just go with a made up name
2017-02-15 21:42:02	@Espyo	Testyo: make a word
2017-02-15 21:42:03	Testyo	Zeum.
2017-02-15 21:42:13	@Espyo	...Zeum TOTALLY sounds like a Fire Emblem character name
2017-02-15 21:42:18	Yoshi2	genius
2017-02-15 21:42:24	Yoshi2	that will be my FE OC
2017-02-15 21:42:31	@Espyo	sounds like an onomatopoeia, actually
2017-02-15 21:42:32	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-02-15 21:42:33	Yoshi2	100% original do not steal
2017-02-15 21:42:43	@Espyo	fine, I'll make my OWN OC, based on your OC, Zeum
2017-02-15 21:42:43	Yoshi2	the fuck is an onomatopaodpa
2017-02-15 21:42:44	@Espyo	Testyo: make a word
2017-02-15 21:42:44	Testyo	Neshaugov.
2017-02-15 21:42:50	@Espyo	that's a tome name ^
2017-02-15 21:43:00	@Espyo	an onomatopoeia is the word used to describe a sound
2017-02-15 21:43:00	Yoshi2	oh
2017-02-15 21:43:06	@Espyo	"woosh", "bleep", etc.
2017-02-15 21:43:17	Yoshi2	you don't know slopes and yet you know THAT word
2017-02-15 21:43:24	@Espyo	come at me
2017-02-15 21:43:49	Yoshi2	but good to know that there is a word for that
2017-02-15 21:44:14	@Espyo	yep
2017-02-15 21:44:20	@Espyo	and that it's a nightmare to write
2017-02-15 21:46:57	Yoshi2	I never really understood what people disliked about FE:A
2017-02-15 21:47:02	Yoshi2	... till I started doing marriage
2017-02-15 21:47:23	Yoshi2	the game suddenly turns into a slice of life anime
2017-02-15 21:47:44	@Espyo	huh? what do you mean?
2017-02-15 21:49:25	Yoshi2	the supports are about characters doing stuff, e.g. daughter asking dad whether they can go shopping or two characters training so one can catch the sword with their hands
2017-02-15 21:49:31	Yoshi2	slices of their life
2017-02-15 21:49:42	@Espyo	that's a BAD thing?
2017-02-15 22:00:00	Yoshi2	not necessarily but the main story is rather weak and the is so much support text
2017-02-15 22:00:22	@Espyo	woah, I strongly disagree
2017-02-15 22:00:29	@Espyo	the story definitely need to be buffed up
2017-02-15 22:00:36	@Espyo	but the support conversations so make up for it
2017-02-15 22:01:04	@Espyo	they're mostly well-written, detailed, make the characters relatable, have smart humour when it counts, can pack one HELL of a feels punch when they want to
2017-02-15 22:01:16	@Espyo	there are a couple of oddballs here and there, but hey, there are over 400 in total
2017-02-15 22:01:40	Yoshi2	exactly, all the effort went into the support
2017-02-15 22:01:52	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-15 22:01:55	@Espyo	I misread what you wrote
2017-02-15 22:01:58	@Espyo	because you typo'd
2017-02-15 22:02:06	@Espyo	I read it as "and so is much of the support text"
2017-02-15 22:02:10	@Espyo	lol
2017-02-15 22:02:22	@Espyo	yeah, guess so
2017-02-15 22:02:34	@Espyo	still, what you said at the start of this convo implies that you don't like these slice of life conversations
2017-02-15 22:04:00	Yoshi2	for the most part I don't mind it, though the S support feels very cheesy
2017-02-15 22:05:36	@Espyo	I'll give you that
2017-02-15 22:05:41	@Espyo	the S-supports are more miss than hit
2017-02-15 22:05:46	@Espyo	because of the way the game has to work
2017-02-15 22:05:51	@Espyo	C is usually just whatever
2017-02-15 22:05:57	@Espyo	B is usually so-so
2017-02-15 22:05:59	@Espyo	A is usually friendly
2017-02-15 22:06:06	@Espyo	and then S is usually "omg I actually love you forever"
2017-02-15 22:06:12	@Espyo	it's such a whiplash
2017-02-15 22:06:17	@Espyo	but it has to be that way...
2017-02-15 22:06:23	@Espyo	you can't have C be so-so, B be friendly, and A be flirty
2017-02-15 22:06:27	@Espyo	it would make more sense
2017-02-15 22:06:38	@Espyo	but what if you have a married unit do A support with a different unit?
2017-02-15 22:06:43	@Espyo	and they start flirting it up?
2017-02-15 22:06:47	@Espyo	it's tough
2017-02-15 22:06:54	@Espyo	that said, some of them were still lazily written
2017-02-15 22:07:06	@Espyo	others actually work well
2017-02-15 22:07:09	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-02-15 22:19:01	Yoshi2	yeah, they kinda had to squeeze the lovey-dovey thing into S
2017-02-15 22:20:09	@Espyo	ah well
2017-02-15 22:20:14	@Espyo	but hey, you've got this as an alternative http://textsfromfea.tumblr.com
2017-02-15 22:20:17	@Espyo	(NSFW)
2017-02-15 22:20:21	@Espyo	those make me cry of laughter, holy hell
2017-02-15 22:20:42	@Espyo	(and the occasional spoiler)
2017-02-15 22:26:58	Yoshi2	nice

2017-02-16 18:57:38	Testyo	yeah... carrier Pikmin don't feel like I was particularly imaginative when I made mine
2017-02-16 18:57:51	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo
2017-02-16 19:02:01	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-16 19:06:48	Neocraftz1553	Just when I thought I finished the Bulborb and the Sheargrub's "waking up and walking around aimlessly" script, I run into another problem.
2017-02-16 19:08:09	Neocraftz1553	The Bulborb walks in place sometimes if you approach it when it's "exploring"... for some reason.
2017-02-16 19:08:13	Neocraftz1553	 /sometimes/
2017-02-16 19:08:52	@Espyo	use F5 on top of it
2017-02-16 19:08:58	@Espyo	and it'll let you know what state it's in
2017-02-16 19:09:01	@Espyo	as well as the states it was on
2017-02-16 19:09:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2017-02-16 19:09:07	@Espyo	that should give you an idea of what state it's stuck in
2017-02-16 19:09:08	Neocraftz1553	it's stuck in the chasing state
2017-02-16 19:09:15	Neocraftz1553	I'm checking it now
2017-02-16 19:09:19	@Espyo	hm
2017-02-16 19:09:33	@Espyo	well, one of the events of the chasing state that you thought went through didn't go through :P
2017-02-16 19:10:17	Neocraftz1553	hmmm
2017-02-16 19:11:08	Neocraftz1553	I'm not sure what
2017-02-16 19:11:15	Neocraftz1553	Let me try to recreate it again
2017-02-16 19:11:55	Neocraftz1553	Not sure what
2017-02-16 19:12:14	Neocraftz1553	It only happened once, for some reason
2017-02-16 19:12:26	Neocraftz1553	Guess it got stuck between states...?
2017-02-16 19:12:54	@Espyo	that shouldn't be the case..
2017-02-16 19:12:58	@Espyo	it can only be on one state at a time
2017-02-16 19:13:31	Neocraftz1553	Why not two :p
2017-02-16 19:13:36	Neocraftz1553	jk
2017-02-16 19:13:40	Neocraftz1553	they can conflict
2017-02-16 19:13:54	Yoshi2	there are 10 people in the world
2017-02-16 19:14:05	Yoshi2	those who understand binary, those who don't
2017-02-16 19:14:13	Yoshi2	and those who didn't expect this to be a base 3 joke
2017-02-16 19:15:06	@Espyo	yyyyyyyyyyyyep
2017-02-16 19:17:24	Yoshi2	or base 4
2017-02-16 19:17:25	Yoshi2	or base 5
2017-02-16 19:17:34	Yoshi2	in fact I could continue forever
2017-02-16 19:20:51	Yoshi2	I wonder if base infinity exists
2017-02-16 19:22:40	Neocraftz1553	Hey, Espyo, why do the sheargrubs kill each other if they spawn/dig up when they're nearby...?
2017-02-16 19:22:51	Neocraftz1553	I though it was only on_pikmin_land
2017-02-16 19:23:03	@Espyo	O_O
2017-02-16 19:23:34	@Espyo	c-can you give me an example scenario
2017-02-16 19:23:36	@Espyo	*?
2017-02-16 19:24:29	Yoshi2	snuff porn
2017-02-16 19:24:30	Neocraftz1553	Well, since I couldn't make the Male Sheargrub sense you from a decent distance AND start attacking when close up, I made them wander around for a bit and then dig down(if they get too far, they return "home")
2017-02-16 19:25:01	@Espyo	okay...
2017-02-16 19:25:19	Neocraftz1553	Now, I was testing them out on a flat area
2017-02-16 19:25:45	Neocraftz1553	I wasn't really paying attention to them, they were just doing their do(I was checking on the Bulborb)
2017-02-16 19:26:30	Neocraftz1553	Then I saw one dig up at the same-ish time as the other two, and all of a sudden the other two dropped dead
2017-02-16 19:27:57	@Espyo	very weird...
2017-02-16 19:28:29	Neocraftz1553	Not sure how to recreate it, since they somewhat randomly choose their destination.
2017-02-16 19:28:45	Neocraftz1553	I'm going to leave the engine running meanwhile to see if it happens again
2017-02-16 19:29:21	Neocraftz1553	at 32x speed :o
2017-02-16 19:29:51	Neocraftz1553	ripperoni, Olimar, you shall be missed
2017-02-16 19:30:12	@Espyo	that...ain't such a good idea
2017-02-16 19:30:17	@Espyo	I can already imagine the physics engine crying
2017-02-16 19:30:34	@Espyo	if you're running at 32x speed, mobs will travel 32x as much distance every frame
2017-02-16 19:30:41	@Espyo	if they just want to walk forward a bit, they zoom out of the map instantly
2017-02-16 19:30:55	Neocraftz1553	hehe
2017-02-16 19:31:12	Neocraftz1553	I killed it
2017-02-16 19:32:18	Neocraftz1553	 16x speed seems acceptable, at least, for the engine.
2017-02-16 19:32:51	Neocraftz1553	haha
2017-02-16 19:32:57	@Espyo	it has its moments...
2017-02-16 19:33:17	@Espyo	sometimes, I only need to let the engine freeze for a fraction of a second, and that's enough for mobs to just walk through everything
2017-02-16 19:33:38	Neocraftz1553	There was a Sheargrub doing doghnuts at 16x speed
2017-02-16 19:34:21	Neocraftz1553	Nothing strange has happened in a two day cycle, but when the glitch occurred not even a day passed.
2017-02-16 19:34:43	Neocraftz1553	I mean, at least their chompers work...
2017-02-16 19:36:39	Neocraftz1553	They seem stronger in terms of clearing up Pikmin, but they don't damage captains if they walk into them... huh.
2017-02-16 19:36:40	Neocraftz1553	I
2017-02-16 19:36:46	Neocraftz1553	I'll have to work on that.
2017-02-16 19:45:18	Neocraftz1553	Oh god I spicy spray'd it
2017-02-16 19:53:46	@Espyo	WAIT
2017-02-16 19:53:51	@Espyo	a Sheargrub doing donuts really fast?
2017-02-16 19:53:56	@Espyo	why... that reminds me of...

2017-02-16 19:59:05	Neocraftz1553	LOL
2017-02-16 19:59:11	Neocraftz1553	I remember that
2017-02-16 19:59:41	Neocraftz1553	They went so fast that some even jumped into the air
2017-02-16 20:05:36	Neocraftz1553	After about a day of testing, I'd say the Male Sheargrubs are somewhat complete: http://imgur.com/rltzpK7
2017-02-16 20:05:43	Neocraftz1553	Now for the Shearwigs.
2017-02-16 20:07:39	@Espyo	sick
2017-02-16 20:07:46	@Espyo	hmm, but something looks off about them...
2017-02-16 20:07:51	@Espyo	are their backs also brown?
2017-02-16 20:07:54	@Espyo	I mean, their butts
2017-02-16 20:07:59	@Espyo	I thought they had purple butts
2017-02-16 20:08:43	Neocraftz1553	They do
2017-02-16 20:08:53	Neocraftz1553	I guess I need to make them a bit more...
2017-02-16 20:08:55	Neocraftz1553	thick.
2017-02-16 20:12:33	Yoshi2	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
2017-02-16 20:12:48	Neocraftz1553	huehuehue
2017-02-16 20:12:52	Neocraftz1553	Since I'm done with the Male Sheargrub, I think Shearwigs will be a bit easier to make.
2017-02-16 20:13:19	Neocraftz1553	I just need to adjust their script so that they fly on a big_damage_interval.
2017-02-16 20:13:48	Neocraftz1553	And during their flight, they'll be on hit wonders for thrown pikmin, like spectralids.
2017-02-16 20:14:17	Neocraftz1553	Except for the Twilight Spectralid. That'll get you flung off a ledge if you're near a bottomless pit.
2017-02-16 20:19:35	@Espyo	yep
2017-02-16 20:27:36	Neocraftz1553	Hey Espyo, is there a way to change the health regeneration rate in scripts?
2017-02-16 20:27:43	@Espyo	nope
2017-02-16 20:27:47	@Espyo	but
2017-02-16 20:27:49	@Espyo	you can set a timer
2017-02-16 20:27:54	@Espyo	and damage the enemy negatively :P
2017-02-16 20:28:01	Neocraftz1553	Ah
2017-02-16 20:28:13	Neocraftz1553	What's the script line for that?
2017-02-16 20:28:48	@Espyo	well, two of them
2017-02-16 20:28:51	@Espyo	one to set the timer
2017-02-16 20:28:53	@Espyo	probably like once a second
2017-02-16 20:29:02	@Espyo	and then on the "on_timer" event
2017-02-16 20:29:09	@Espyo	use uh... "set_health" or something
2017-02-16 20:29:26	Neocraftz1553	Hmm
2017-02-16 20:29:32	Neocraftz1553	I could take a look in the engine's code
2017-02-16 20:31:32	Neocraftz1553	mob_set_health, mob_set_health_absolute and mob_set_health_relative
2017-02-16 20:31:43	Neocraftz1553	I have a feeling it's relative...?
2017-02-16 20:31:54	Neocraftz1553	Do I just type that into the script, or...?
2017-02-16 20:32:38	Neocraftz1553	Oh wait
2017-02-16 20:32:40	Neocraftz1553	it is set_health
2017-02-16 20:32:55	@Espyo	you don't need to check the code
2017-02-16 20:32:57	@Espyo	it's all documented on the wiki
2017-02-16 20:33:03	Neocraftz1553	derp
2017-02-16 20:33:46	Neocraftz1553	wait, there's nothing about set_health in the Object Script tutorial
2017-02-16 20:34:06	Neocraftz1553	wait, yes
2017-02-16 20:34:27	Neocraftz1553	it's just health.
2017-02-16 20:35:14	Neocraftz1553	So, can I make Pikmin 3 on this?
2017-02-16 20:37:04	@Espyo	lol ye
2017-02-16 20:37:31	Neocraftz1553	heh
2017-02-16 20:37:43	Neocraftz1553	Well, I mean, you can, but you can't
2017-02-16 20:55:29	Yoshi2	i shall try rendering models to a 2d image, weeee
2017-02-16 20:55:47	Neocraftz1553	wot
2017-02-16 20:55:57	Neocraftz1553	Show the results when your done
2017-02-16 20:56:04	Neocraftz1553	I'd love to see
2017-02-16 21:26:11	Yoshi2	first I need to find my blender rendering code, where the heck did it go

2017-02-17 20:45:58	Yoshi2	long day today again?
2017-02-17 20:46:13	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-17 20:46:13	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-17 20:46:37	@Espyo	company's birthday today
2017-02-17 20:46:42	@Espyo	we had a company lunch
2017-02-17 20:46:47	@Espyo	and then just spent the rest of the day gaming
2017-02-17 20:48:53	Yoshi2	neat
2017-02-17 20:50:18	@Espyo	played some Binding of Isaac co-op
2017-02-17 20:50:19	@Espyo	it gets
2017-02-17 20:50:20	@Espyo	SO
2017-02-17 20:50:21	@Espyo	HECTIC
2017-02-17 20:50:22	@Espyo	so quickly
2017-02-17 20:50:35	@Espyo	I lost track of my own character a lot of times
2017-02-17 20:50:40	@Espyo	and I'm used to how the game works
2017-02-17 20:50:53	@Espyo	imagine two of my other friends who were controlling the other two buddies, and have never played it before
2017-02-17 20:55:27	Yoshi2	it
2017-02-17 20:55:29	Yoshi2	has
2017-02-17 20:55:30	Yoshi2	coop?
2017-02-17 20:55:44	@Espyo	the new one does
2017-02-17 20:55:58	@Espyo	by "new one", I mean "not the 8-year old flash original one"
2017-02-17 20:56:03	@Espyo	(8? probably 8)
2017-02-17 20:58:19	Yoshi2	excuse me but i do not keep track of how old it is
2017-02-17 20:58:40	Yoshi2	there is like binding of isaac and there is rebirth I think? And then there is afterbirth
2017-02-17 20:59:17	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-17 20:59:24	@Espyo	I'm honestly not keeping track either
2017-02-17 20:59:24	@Espyo	it's hard
2017-02-17 20:59:26	@Espyo	but yeah, co-op
2017-02-17 20:59:32	@Espyo	player 1 is Isaac or whoever
2017-02-17 20:59:48	@Espyo	players 2 to 4 are just little familiar baby ghosts that can move and shoot freely
2017-02-17 21:00:02	@Espyo	to spawn a baby, Isaac needs to lose one heart
2017-02-17 21:00:16	@Espyo	and despawning a baby gives whatever health that baby had back to Isaac
2017-02-17 21:00:21	@Espyo	so you can go in and out at any time
2017-02-17 21:00:58	@Espyo	(or at least you could if controllers in PC game behaved well in 2017 :) :) :) )

2017-02-17 21:06:29	Yoshi2	nice
2017-02-17 21:07:01	Yoshi2	I still have to restart dolphin to have it detect my controller if I plug the controller in after starting dolphin

2017-02-17 22:39:52	@Espyo	oooh... a Long Legs...
2017-02-17 22:40:05	@Espyo	well, let me just say: I wouldn't create a Long Legs on the engine
2017-02-17 22:40:09	@Espyo	it's possible, but INSANELY hard
2017-02-17 22:40:15	@Espyo	because each leg is meant to be independent
2017-02-17 22:40:22	@Espyo	*each foot is meant to be independent
2017-02-17 22:40:28	@Espyo	and the legs are meant to connect to them dynamically
2017-02-17 22:40:33	@Espyo	both are not possible in the engine
2017-02-17 22:40:41	@Espyo	and won't be, since it's too much work for almost nothing
2017-02-17 22:40:51	@Espyo	you can just have the legs and feet be a normal part of the sprite
2017-02-17 22:40:58	@Espyo	but to get it done right, you'll need hundreds of sprites...
2017-02-17 22:41:14	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, I know that to an extent(as in I didn't know that)
2017-02-17 22:41:32	Neocraftz1553	But, I have a simple idea on how it could work, to an extent
2017-02-17 22:41:41	@Espyo	I hope it works, then
2017-02-17 22:41:44	@Espyo	good luck!
2017-02-17 22:42:15	Neocraftz1553	Basically, it won't rotate at all, it would move in a square-ish pattern
2017-02-17 22:42:15	Neocraftz1553	to the left, then down, then right, then back up.
2017-02-17 22:42:25	Neocraftz1553	Of course, it's going to take tons of sprites for that, but it can be done.
2017-02-17 22:49:30	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-02-17 22:49:34	@Espyo	yeah, that sounds good

2017-02-17 23:16:12	Neocraftz1553	I remember I had a model for it, but I forgot where exactly I got it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-02-17 23:16:26	@Espyo	from Scruffy?
2017-02-17 23:17:14	Neocraftz1553	Not sure
2017-02-17 23:17:19	Neocraftz1553	Maybe

2017-02-18 14:38:49	@Espyo	what about the phone itself? any good?

2017-02-18 15:20:24	@Espyo	that's good to hear, then
2017-02-18 15:20:35	Yoshi2	and massive compared to my previous phone https://i.imgur.com/WW7eU77.png
2017-02-18 15:20:41	@Espyo	spiffy
2017-02-18 15:20:47	@Espyo	hah
2017-02-18 15:21:08	@Espyo	I love how the cord is safely secured like it's a government secret
2017-02-18 15:21:18	@Espyo	ok, so
2017-02-18 15:21:23	@Espyo	what are your Heroes rolls?
2017-02-18 15:31:23	Yoshi2	seems you always get anna, virion, matthew and raigh on the first start (I got them on my sister's phone)
2017-02-18 15:32:25	Yoshi2	I rolled for two more and got jeorge and eliwood (both 4 star)
2017-02-18 15:34:23	Yoshi2	also why google play https://i.imgur.com/gGy4Jex.png
2017-02-18 15:35:55	@Espyo	yeah, you always get those
2017-02-18 15:36:05	@Espyo	not bad
2017-02-18 15:36:17	@Espyo	but remember that you can always clear the save data and re-roll
2017-02-18 15:36:24	@Espyo	OF COURSE TRUMO
2017-02-18 15:36:26	@Espyo	*TRUMP
2017-02-18 15:36:29	@Espyo	HE JUST SCREAMS OF "FIRE EMBLEM"

2017-02-18 15:42:55	Yoshi2	oh it's a donald trump soundboard
2017-02-18 15:43:26	@Espyo	hm
2017-02-18 15:45:23	Yoshi2	oh, FE:H has a list of heroes that are in the current rotation for rolling
2017-02-18 15:45:55	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-18 15:47:09	Yoshi2	I think I saw nowi in it but I'm not sure if I thould bother re-rolling
2017-02-18 15:47:52	@Espyo	eh, you'll have time
2017-02-18 15:47:59	@Espyo	there are also the daily challengers
2017-02-18 15:48:04	@Espyo	I got a couple of units I wanted from there
2017-02-18 15:48:13	@Espyo	sure, if you get those, they're usually 1-star...
2017-02-18 15:48:14	@Espyo	but still
2017-02-18 15:48:19	Yoshi2	heh
2017-02-18 15:50:10	Yoshi2	though I do have waifus now that I want more than Nowi
2017-02-18 15:50:38	Yoshi2	like Nino or Severa or Nah
2017-02-18 15:50:44	Yoshi2	so I guess I'll just carry on
2017-02-18 15:50:54	Yoshi2	and maybe I get some of the Husbandos I liked
2017-02-18 15:51:18	@Espyo	ye
2017-02-18 16:33:34	@Espyo	today's challenge is Donnel!
2017-02-18 16:33:38	@Espyo	got him as soon as I saw that
2017-02-18 16:33:47	@Espyo	time to grow him up just as if I were playing Awakening
2017-02-18 18:08:27	Yoshi2	I guess he won't be as imba as he was in Awakening
2017-02-18 18:10:03	@Espyo	imba?
2017-02-18 18:12:21	Yoshi2	imbalanced
2017-02-18 18:12:31	@Espyo	ah
2017-02-18 18:12:34	Yoshi2	so good it should be nerfed
2017-02-18 18:12:35	@Espyo	yeah, from what I heard, he's so-so
2017-02-18 18:12:48	@Espyo	I've only ever heard that as "OP"
2017-02-18 18:15:50	Yoshi2	"it should be nerfed" is kinda implied when something is overpowered
2017-02-18 18:16:16	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2017-02-18 18:16:20	@Espyo	I mean I never heard the term "imba", only "OP"
2017-02-18 18:16:30	Yoshi2	oh, that's what you meant
2017-02-18 18:16:31	@Espyo	honestly, something can be imbalanced and too weak
2017-02-18 18:16:40	@Espyo	so even "imbalanced" doesn't sound like a proper term...
2017-02-18 18:16:59	Yoshi2	where I come from, imba is used in the context of "not balanced and too good"
2017-02-18 18:18:53	@Espyo	interesting
2017-02-18 18:19:05	@Espyo	like, you just use "imba" in your own language?
2017-02-18 18:19:46	Yoshi2	no, I meant in a "multiplayer background" way
2017-02-18 18:19:56	Yoshi2	stuff like wc3, dota, starcraft
2017-02-18 18:19:56	@Espyo	aaaah heh
2017-02-18 18:20:00	@Espyo	all right, fair
2017-02-18 18:49:55	Yoshi2	ok my old phone's sim card is too big for what this phone takes
2017-02-18 18:58:30	@Espyo	hah!
2017-02-18 18:58:34	@Espyo	that's the exact same problem I had
2017-02-18 19:16:52	Yoshi2	I guess I have to acquire a new sim card
2017-02-18 19:16:56	Yoshi2	and attempt to transfer my number
2017-02-18 19:18:26	@Espyo	I just asked for a re-send of my current card
2017-02-18 19:18:28	@Espyo	keeps the number
2017-02-18 19:18:31	@Espyo	not the contacts
2017-02-18 19:18:59	Yoshi2	my card is a prepaid from a reseller, idk if i can do that
2017-02-18 19:28:01	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-18 19:28:02	@Espyo	worth a try
2017-02-18 19:29:02	@Espyo	check if there's a hotline you can ring
2017-02-18 19:44:02	@J	I remember my cousin having this issue, and he literally just cut the card to size
2017-02-18 19:46:27	@Espyo	that's
2017-02-18 19:46:29	@Espyo	also
2017-02-18 19:46:29	@Espyo	a
2017-02-18 19:46:30	@Espyo	thing
2017-02-18 19:51:28	Yoshi2	mhm yeah a friend of mine told me about that
2017-02-18 20:16:49	Yoshi2	oh dear, is this a bombing of dresden reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_QY3xsLQNI
2017-02-18 20:18:12	@Espyo	hm, I wouldn't know
2017-02-18 20:20:04	Yoshi2	spoiler: it is
2017-02-18 20:23:13	@Espyo	welp
2017-02-18 20:29:14	Yoshi2	the pictured guy is Sir Arthur Harris who was a supporter of area bombing and assisted in carrying out the bombing of dresden, among other things
2017-02-18 20:29:25	@Espyo	boy
2017-02-18 20:37:57	Yoshi2	what also sucks is how some people turn the bombing of dresden into "b-but the allies are at least as bad the nazis because muh dresden"
2017-02-18 20:46:30	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-18 21:52:56	Yoshi2	i can finally watch 10bit h264 encoded anime episodes

2017-02-19 01:00:34	@Espyo	since I plan on getting out of dropbox by the month's end
2017-02-19 01:00:59	Neocraftz1553	Will the model link still work?

2017-02-19 01:02:22	Neocraftz1553	Thanks for telling me, let me just quickly download all of them.
2017-02-19 01:02:46	@Espyo	sure thing
2017-02-19 01:02:52	@Espyo	I'll still have them, anyway
2017-02-19 01:02:55	@Espyo	but yeah, might as well
2017-02-19 01:04:27	Neocraftz1553	Oh, and do custom bridges work on the PFE now?

2017-02-19 01:04:53	@Espyo	custom bridges?
2017-02-19 01:05:11	Neocraftz1553	Errm, like the thingy thing.
2017-02-19 01:05:34	@Espyo	:|
2017-02-19 01:05:44	Neocraftz1553	Like, can you make your own Bridges with different textures/stats but still function like a bridge
2017-02-19 01:05:55	Neocraftz1553	(as in, destroy the thang, and it makes another thang)
2017-02-19 01:08:20	Neocraftz1553	u no get?
2017-02-19 01:08:57	Neocraftz1553	So, let's say you want to make a bridge with a Bulborb sprite, for some reason.
2017-02-19 01:09:51	Neocraftz1553	When you destroy that, the bridge sectors it was on will turn, let's say, into red and white polka-dotted textured sectors(which can be higher or lower depending on what you set them to be when you made the bridge sector)
2017-02-19 01:11:40	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-02-19 01:11:45	@Espyo	no, but I guess it should be possible, huh?
2017-02-19 01:12:00	Neocraftz1553	yes.
2017-02-19 01:12:20	Neocraftz1553	I've been waiting on that Bulborb-looking bridge for quite a while now.

2017-02-19 12:46:53	@Espyo	I guess people want Nintendo to go bankrupt
2017-02-19 12:47:05	@Espyo	they don't seem to get that orbs are the entire reason for people to put money into the game
2017-02-19 12:50:46	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-19 12:50:53	Yoshi2	3 orbs are 3€
2017-02-19 12:50:54	Testyo	3 € = £ 2.1198  / $ 3.2616 
2017-02-19 12:51:00	Yoshi2	2€
2017-02-19 12:51:00	Testyo	2 € = £ 1.4132  / $ 2.1744

2017-02-19 12:51:42	@Espyo	and another "I don't want Nintendo to profit" idea
2017-02-19 12:51:46	@Espyo	good grief, people
2017-02-19 12:54:15	Yoshi2	I don't think they should give out orbs that easily but orbs are also kind of expensive so I think they don't want people to buy them to just get through the story
2017-02-19 12:54:23	Yoshi2	betting on waifu power
2017-02-19 12:54:55	@Espyo	yeah, somebody suggested giving orbs for completing special daily missions
2017-02-19 12:55:05	@Espyo	like completing a map with 2 flying units
2017-02-19 12:55:07	@Espyo	that's pretty good
2017-02-19 12:55:09	@Espyo	you still get orbs
2017-02-19 12:55:12	@Espyo	but you need to work for them
2017-02-19 12:55:26	@Espyo	plus, for some of these missions, you have to do stuff that requires you to do orb-thing
2017-02-19 12:55:27	@Espyo	uh...
2017-02-19 12:55:28	@Espyo	I mean
2017-02-19 12:55:36	@Espyo	if the challenge is to complete a chapter with 2 fliers on your team
2017-02-19 12:55:39	@Espyo	and you don't have 2 fliers
2017-02-19 12:55:43	@Espyo	guess what your next move is gonna be
2017-02-19 12:55:49	@Espyo	roll the dough till you get the second flier
2017-02-19 12:55:51	@Espyo	Nintendo wins anyway
2017-02-19 12:56:11	@Espyo	or if not, at least only the people who already chimed in a good number of orbs will be able to take the most out of the daily orb business
2017-02-19 12:56:20	@Espyo	but noooooooooooo, let's just bicker that we want infinite orbs for free
2017-02-19 13:01:08	Yoshi2	I got up to 24 orbs and will start my next ritual
2017-02-19 13:01:11	Yoshi2	WISH ME LUCK
2017-02-19 13:02:12	Yoshi2	hi donnel
2017-02-19 13:03:32	Yoshi2	Espyo: should I continue with my current orb selection or start a new roll? Hmmmmm
2017-02-19 13:04:02	@Espyo	do
2017-02-19 13:04:03	@Espyo	not
2017-02-19 13:04:03	@Espyo	start
2017-02-19 13:04:05	@Espyo	a new roll
2017-02-19 13:04:13	@Espyo	the ghost of Donnel past will stab you in your sleep
2017-02-19 13:04:20	@Espyo	wait, how many stars?
2017-02-19 13:04:32	Yoshi2	4 stars
2017-02-19 13:04:45	@Espyo	jelly
2017-02-19 13:05:24	Yoshi2	well I already have donnel now, by starting over I get a new selection of orbs (the heroes I want are either blue or green) and I don't get the saving
2017-02-19 13:05:42	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-19 13:05:51	@Espyo	I don't understand
2017-02-19 13:05:58	@Espyo	how can you keep Donnel AND restart the selection?
2017-02-19 13:06:11	@Espyo	oh, you mean you'll quit the current summoning session
2017-02-19 13:06:16	@Espyo	and that refreshes the stones?
2017-02-19 13:06:22	Yoshi2	yes that is what I mean
2017-02-19 13:06:30	@Espyo	ah
2017-02-19 13:06:32	@Espyo	all right, go for it
2017-02-19 13:06:53	Yoshi2	I'll do one more because there is a green orb, then probably start over
2017-02-19 13:07:25	Yoshi2	4 star cecilia
2017-02-19 13:08:06	Yoshi2	LET'S DO IT ONE MORE TIME
2017-02-19 13:08:12	Yoshi2	oh one blue orb and one green orb

2017-02-19 13:13:46	Yoshi2	they can't be used in melee I think
2017-02-19 13:16:52	Yoshi2	but I'm glad donnel is as adorable as in awakening

2017-02-19 14:47:16	@Espyo	...this game has story?
2017-02-19 14:47:21	@Espyo	it has less story than Sonic 1
2017-02-19 14:49:41	Yoshi2	heh
2017-02-19 15:34:49	Yoshi2	if I finish this and don't get a 5 star character (and the chances of that happening are high) i might just start rerolling

2017-02-20 19:06:06	@Espyo	oh, I never tried reverse-engineering that code
2017-02-20 19:14:18	Yoshi2	I think the code changes the XZ position by adding onto it/subtracting from it
2017-02-20 19:14:48	Yoshi2	but when changing the height it changes the acceleration upwards 
2017-02-20 19:15:12	Yoshi2	but the Y coordinate was easy to find anyway because XYZ are generally together

2017-02-20 20:51:59	@Espyo	what's its problem?

2017-02-20 20:52:58	Neocraftz1553	Mostly, it can't open files

2017-02-20 20:54:05	@Espyo	dunno what that is
2017-02-20 20:54:17	Neocraftz1553	I think I need allegro 5 as well, forgot to add that in.
2017-02-20 20:54:25	@Espyo	yeah, you definitely need Allegro 5

2017-02-20 21:03:06	Yoshi2	hmm does it? When I tested it it repacked rarc as U8
2017-02-20 21:03:16	Yoshi2	and I'm not sure if pikmin2 supports that
2017-02-20 21:03:53	@Espyo	hmm

2017-02-20 21:08:43	Yoshi2	I used wszst CREATE which couldn't createa rarc
2017-02-20 21:08:59	@Espyo	ah, yeah, I never tried CREATE
2017-02-20 21:09:21	Yoshi2	does update work with changing sizes?
2017-02-20 21:09:30	Yoshi2	e.g. adding a much bigger file
2017-02-20 21:10:59	Yoshi2	"only files with the same size are updated"
2017-02-20 21:11:12	Yoshi2	can this tool please be any more useless
2017-02-20 21:25:19	Yoshi2	i'm really upset, the tool claims to be able to create rarc when it can't do shit
2017-02-20 21:37:54	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-02-20 21:38:00	@Espyo	it does notify you if the size is bigger than the original
2017-02-20 21:38:04	@Espyo	but I'm sure it allows you to do smaller files
2017-02-20 21:38:06	@Espyo	and they work in-game
2017-02-20 21:39:05	Neocraftz1553	and here I am trying to get Pikmin 1 to run at 5k on my less-than-capable computer.

2017-02-20 21:50:02	Neocraftz1553	 8 FPS and 5 minute long loading screens are ok if I get to play it with 5k graphics.

2017-02-20 21:56:56	Yoshi2	if it properly supported the format it could do whatever sizes
2017-02-20 21:57:15	Yoshi2	lunaboy's rarc tools seems to work decently

2017-02-20 22:11:53	Yoshi2	i had some bat files ready to make work easier with lunaboy's tool (when extracting it makes a folder called arc so the tool renames arc to whatever the user wants and the packer doesn't compress the rarc so after the packer finishes the bat runs yaz0enc to compress the rarc and deletes the intermediate file)
2017-02-20 22:12:09	@Espyo	great
2017-02-20 22:26:39	@Espyo	Yoshi2: so what exactly did you do to get the address from the moon jump code?
2017-02-20 22:26:49	@Espyo	just read through the instructions until you found one that was clearly "change THIS address"?
2017-02-20 22:35:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: if it's a gecko code (and in this case it is) your best friend is http://geckocodes.org/index.php?arsenal=1
2017-02-20 22:36:07	@Espyo	yeah, I went there
2017-02-20 22:36:07	Yoshi2	now you can break up the movement code
2017-02-20 22:36:12	@Espyo	but still, is that really all you did?
2017-02-20 22:36:18	@Espyo	not quite sure it'll help me in this case
2017-02-20 22:36:20	@Espyo	this code is dumb
2017-02-20 22:36:29	Yoshi2	lines starting with 20 are if statements
2017-02-20 22:36:33	@Espyo	http://pikmintkb.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Pikmin_AR_codes
2017-02-20 22:36:36	@Espyo	it's the moonjump code here
2017-02-20 22:36:43	@Espyo	looks like it's just plain-old setting some addresses
2017-02-20 22:36:51	@Espyo	then at the end, it checks if the controller is pressing the A button
2017-02-20 22:36:59	@Espyo	all fine and dandy
2017-02-20 22:37:08	@Espyo	but I can't make heads or toes about all of those addresses it's setting at the start
2017-02-20 22:37:10	@Espyo	or the very last one
2017-02-20 22:37:14	@Espyo	their values don't make sense
2017-02-20 22:37:50	Yoshi2	gecko is easier to read because that shit ain't encrypted
2017-02-20 22:38:05	@Espyo	oh, damn
2017-02-20 22:38:12	@Espyo	didn't realize that page had them in that encrypted format

2017-02-20 22:39:48	@Espyo	doesn't help that the code doesn't even work for me...
2017-02-20 22:39:52	@Espyo	yeah, does, doesn't it?
2017-02-20 22:39:56	@Espyo	it's just loud nonsense
2017-02-20 22:40:21	Yoshi2	so yeah, why gecko is significant is that there is a very great gecko code right here: http://geckocodes.org/index.php?c=gpve01
2017-02-20 22:41:00	@Espyo	for P2
2017-02-20 22:41:17	Yoshi2	oh you want pikmin 1?

2017-02-20 22:42:15	@Espyo	well, failing a moon-jump code, I guess I'll try using known coordinates
2017-02-20 22:42:23	@Espyo	I mean, I don't really know any coordinates, but I can kinda guess them...
2017-02-20 22:42:25	Yoshi2	whelp i was about to get started on gecko
2017-02-20 22:42:31	@Espyo	by checking the enemy spawn properties
2017-02-20 22:44:32	Yoshi2	that code you posted probably patches code in the memory
2017-02-20 22:44:48	@Espyo	yeah, it's starting to look like it...
2017-02-20 22:44:51	@Espyo	eugh
2017-02-20 22:44:54	Yoshi2	you could load the code and see wtf dolphin is doing at that address
2017-02-20 22:45:08	@Espyo	thing is, the code doesn't even WORK for me
2017-02-20 22:45:12	@Espyo	I don't get it
2017-02-20 22:45:23	@Espyo	all other of his codes work
2017-02-20 22:55:46	Yoshi2	http://www.gc-forever.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2619 has a moonjump code too, but for the US version
2017-02-20 22:57:42	@Espyo	oh!
2017-02-20 22:57:45	@Espyo	I didn't find this anywhere
2017-02-20 22:57:48	@Espyo	and believe me, I searched

2017-02-20 22:57:54	@Espyo	let me give it a try
2017-02-20 22:58:16	Yoshi2	I would be willing to believe that one of them was incorrectly ported
2017-02-20 22:58:57	@Espyo	http://pastebin.com/ZVm3XVPy this is the unobfuscated US code
2017-02-20 22:59:10	@Espyo	they're different, at least
2017-02-20 22:59:13	@Espyo	so it's not a copy-paste error
2017-02-20 22:59:26	Yoshi2	mhm
2017-02-20 23:00:07	@Espyo	nope
2017-02-20 23:00:09	@Espyo	doesn't work anyway
2017-02-20 23:00:29	Yoshi2	maybe only works in a specific level?
2017-02-20 23:01:11	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-02-20 23:01:12	@Espyo	that's a good guess

2017-02-21 19:07:49	@Espyo	thanks
2017-02-21 19:21:24	Yoshi2	also no idea why ralph's moonjump code doesn't work but I checked out the code it patches and it runs through but no idea what it does 
2017-02-21 19:21:30	Yoshi2	but it did help me find some coordinates
2017-02-21 19:21:51	Yoshi2	but the addresses I found were level specific, wonder if there is a better way to do it
2017-02-21 19:22:03	Yoshi2	a better address that is static for all levels
2017-02-21 20:11:19	@Espyo	Yoshi2: editing the address makes Olimar go to that spot...
2017-02-21 20:11:29	@Espyo	and then instantly back to the previous spot, after some 4 or 5 frames
2017-02-21 20:27:54	Yoshi2	there is a second set of coords that I found that I am pretty sure changes his actual position
2017-02-21 20:28:14	Yoshi2	+ i made a gecko movement code that works in impact site
2017-02-21 20:29:11	Yoshi2	80d914ac 80d914b0 80d914b4
2017-02-21 20:29:11	Yoshi2	80d91488 80d9148c 80d91490 olimar's acceleration for x/y/z
2017-02-21 20:29:11	Testyo	9148 C = 16498.4 °F / 9421.15 K
2017-02-21 20:29:28	Yoshi2	(the first 3 are the position, the second 3 are the acceleration)
2017-02-21 20:29:52	Yoshi2	Espyo: ^
2017-02-21 20:40:42	Yoshi2	i found a new interesting address, hmm
2017-02-21 20:42:24	@Espyo	:(
2017-02-21 20:42:36	@Espyo	that still means there's no one coordinate address...
2017-02-21 20:42:43	Yoshi2	in a different level now
2017-02-21 20:42:43	@Espyo	still, a speed address would be nice
2017-02-21 20:42:58	@Espyo	if you tell me that those last 3 work and are the speed addresses, that's good
2017-02-21 20:43:04	@Espyo	but the coordinate address I tried was a bust
2017-02-21 20:43:44	@Espyo	WHAT
2017-02-21 20:43:48	@Espyo	WHERE IS EVERYTHING
2017-02-21 20:43:52	@Espyo	the map just started
2017-02-21 20:43:57	@Espyo	and it's showing me nonthingness
2017-02-21 20:43:58	@Espyo	there's no Olimar
2017-02-21 20:44:02	@Espyo	I can't open menus
2017-02-21 20:44:06	Yoshi2	80d914ac 80d914b0 80d914b4 are legit coordinate addresses in impact site, 80d91488 80d9148c 80d91490 are legit speed addresses in impact site
2017-02-21 20:44:06	Testyo	9148 C = 16498.4 °F / 9421.15 K
2017-02-21 20:44:10	@Espyo	here's the zinger: I didn't change anything YET
2017-02-21 20:44:30	@Espyo	are they?
2017-02-21 20:44:40	@Espyo	it's just that I tried changing the coordinate, and, like I said, it just reverted Olimar back...
2017-02-21 20:48:39	@Espyo	I
2017-02-21 20:48:43	@Espyo	just can't make heads or toes of this
2017-02-21 20:48:59	@Espyo	I set 0x80d9148c to a couple of different values
2017-02-21 20:48:59	Testyo	9148 C = 16498.4 °F / 9421.15 K
2017-02-21 20:49:13	@Espyo	either had no effect, or made the camera take a trip to the nether world and return to normal after like 3 in-game minutes
2017-02-21 20:50:13	Yoshi2	are you keeping in mind that they are 32 bit floats?
2017-02-21 20:50:29	@Espyo	(no) probably?
2017-02-21 20:50:35	@Espyo	I'm a simple man
2017-02-21 20:50:38	@Espyo	I tried 00000000
2017-02-21 20:50:40	@Espyo	 00000001
2017-02-21 20:50:45	@Espyo	 08000000
2017-02-21 20:50:47	Yoshi2	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
2017-02-21 20:50:49	@Espyo	and F0000000
2017-02-21 20:51:04	@Espyo	didn't feel like converting those to float to see what they did
2017-02-21 20:51:10	@Espyo	because they had to do SOMETHING logical
2017-02-21 20:51:12	@Espyo	and none of them did
2017-02-21 20:51:32	@Espyo	but, benefit of the doubt
2017-02-21 20:51:36	@Espyo	I'll try non-crazy values
2017-02-21 20:51:38	Yoshi2	0800000 is 3.85186E-34
2017-02-21 20:51:43	@Espyo	I'll try c1f00000, which is -30
2017-02-21 20:51:54	@Espyo	yeah, maybe I shouldn't assume I know floats
2017-02-21 20:51:56	@Espyo	I'm only mortal :(
2017-02-21 20:51:57	Yoshi2	F000000 is -1.58456325E29
2017-02-21 20:52:40	@Espyo	oh
2017-02-21 20:52:44	@Espyo	sense IS here
2017-02-21 20:52:53	@Espyo	 453b8000 worked (3000 in decimal)
2017-02-21 20:52:56	@Espyo	shot Olimar way high up
2017-02-21 20:53:02	@Espyo	ok, back in business
2017-02-21 20:53:12	@Espyo	now then
2017-02-21 20:53:13	Yoshi2	yay
2017-02-21 20:53:19	@Espyo	should be easy to make a moon jump code out of this, no?
2017-02-21 20:53:22	@Espyo	at least for TIS
2017-02-21 20:53:27	@Espyo	what I'm starting to wonder is
2017-02-21 20:53:38	@Espyo	there's no one spot in memory for Olimar's coordinates
2017-02-21 20:53:47	@Espyo	Olimar's just another object, and has coordinate values like the rest
2017-02-21 20:53:55	@Espyo	so if Olimar's one of the last objects loaded
2017-02-21 20:54:07	@Espyo	different areas will make the variables be in different parts of memory
2017-02-21 20:54:27	@Espyo	[TIS object 1][TIS object 2]...[TIS object 359][Olimar]
2017-02-21 20:54:42	@Espyo	[TFH object 1][TFH object 2]...[TFH object 577][Olimar]
2017-02-21 20:55:22	Yoshi2	I made an entire movement code for impact site https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/212795100818833408/283623425505886208/movement_geckocode.txt
2017-02-21 20:56:00	@Espyo	hmm, pretty complex
2017-02-21 20:56:03	@Espyo	probably too complex?
2017-02-21 20:56:08	@Espyo	you can probably get everywhere with moon jump alone
2017-02-21 20:56:14	@Espyo	still, let me give it a shot
2017-02-21 20:56:59	Yoshi2	yeah, if only moonjump is needed then it's 3 or 4 lines
2017-02-21 20:58:20	Yoshi2	zzzzz are u fucking serious, dolphin crashed with a renderbase error
2017-02-21 20:58:27	@Espyo	welp
2017-02-21 20:58:30	Yoshi2	ugh what was that address I found earlier
2017-02-21 20:58:31	@Espyo	that code makes Olimar move non-stop
2017-02-21 20:58:35	@Espyo	oh no!
2017-02-21 20:58:40	@Espyo	you lost it?
2017-02-21 20:58:41	@Espyo	ugh
2017-02-21 20:58:54	Yoshi2	i think it was d6f584 but not sure
2017-02-21 20:59:02	Yoshi2	z+a will make olimar stop
2017-02-21 20:59:33	@Espyo	tried
2017-02-21 20:59:35	@Espyo	didn't work
2017-02-21 21:00:01	Yoshi2	what
2017-02-21 21:00:09	@Espyo	Z first then A, A first then Z, both on the same frame...
2017-02-21 21:00:10	@Espyo	nothing
2017-02-21 21:00:16	Yoshi2	i tested that stuff before I posted the code, zzzzzzzzzzzz
2017-02-21 21:00:31	@Espyo	hehe, is "zzzzz" an expression of rage over there?
2017-02-21 21:00:54	@Espyo	I mean, ever since I learned that Brasilians use "rsrrsrsrssrrsrs" to mean laughter... because what
2017-02-21 21:01:05	@Espyo	I now believe any language can have anything represent anything
2017-02-21 21:01:20	Yoshi2	i have an online friend who uses it, don't think it means anything in a specific language
2017-02-21 21:01:31	@Espyo	hm
2017-02-21 21:01:33	@Espyo	first I've heard of it
2017-02-21 21:03:21	Yoshi2	yeah I don't think it's common but it kinda works as showing a sign of annoyance in my mind
2017-02-21 21:03:30	@Espyo	guess so
2017-02-21 21:03:32	Yoshi2	simple moonjump code: 2839D400 00000010
2017-02-21 21:03:32	Yoshi2	04d9148c 43480000
2017-02-21 21:03:32	Yoshi2	E2000001 80008000
2017-02-21 21:03:32	Testyo	9148 C = 16498.4 °F / 9421.15 K
2017-02-21 21:03:42	@Espyo	on pressing what?
2017-02-21 21:03:43	Yoshi2	with Z
2017-02-21 21:03:46	@Espyo	all right
2017-02-21 21:03:56	Yoshi2	if you want something like A that can be changed
2017-02-21 21:04:17	@Espyo	yeah, I'll check the table if I want
2017-02-21 21:04:19	@Espyo	but Z should work fine
2017-02-21 21:04:20	@Espyo	thanks
2017-02-21 21:05:34	@Espyo	D:
2017-02-21 21:05:39	@Espyo	he rises regardless of what button I'm pressing
2017-02-21 21:06:14	@Espyo	you sure this is The Impact Site?
2017-02-21 21:06:18	@Espyo	not The Forest of Hope?
2017-02-21 21:11:32	Yoshi2	yes
2017-02-21 21:12:05	@Espyo	dunno then...
2017-02-21 21:12:06	Yoshi2	in fact this moonjump-only code is the first two lines and last line of the movement code
2017-02-21 21:12:12	@Espyo	right
2017-02-21 21:12:39	@Espyo	meanwhile, I tried out the coordinate codes some more
2017-02-21 21:12:42	@Espyo	they DO work
2017-02-21 21:12:43	@Espyo	thing is...
2017-02-21 21:13:02	@Espyo	if your X is close to the new X you try to set
2017-02-21 21:13:04	@Espyo	Olimar just...
2017-02-21 21:13:09	@Espyo	goes to it, but then walks to his old X
2017-02-21 21:13:28	@Espyo	however, if you're a bit farther away, changing the coordinate works as it should
2017-02-21 21:13:35	@Espyo	I... I really don't get this game
2017-02-21 21:13:50	Yoshi2	mhm
2017-02-21 21:14:00	@Espyo	well, at least the addresses all work
2017-02-21 21:14:02	@Espyo	great job, man!
2017-02-21 21:14:11	@Espyo	for The Impact Site, at least...
2017-02-21 21:14:22	@Espyo	still, I'll document these on the KB
2017-02-21 21:14:27	@Espyo	and I'll find the equivalents for the European version
2017-02-21 21:14:28	@Espyo	should be easy
2017-02-21 21:14:49	@Espyo	if I know that on this strip of land, Olimar's Y is this value, and on top of that thing, it's this value, and on top of that thing over there it's that value
2017-02-21 21:15:06	@Espyo	then I can just search the same places and values on the European and Japanese versions
2017-02-21 21:15:09	@Espyo	and get the addresses
2017-02-21 21:15:15	@Espyo	implying the world geometry didn't change between versions
2017-02-21 21:15:17	@Espyo	shouldn't have changed
2017-02-21 21:15:20	@Espyo	but first, dinner
2017-02-21 21:30:16	Yoshi2	ok writing downn three addresses I found
2017-02-21 21:30:40	Yoshi2	D91ABC DA99E8 15FCA60
2017-02-21 21:38:55	Yoshi2	first one didnt do crap
2017-02-21 21:39:30	@Espyo	bril
2017-02-21 21:40:35	Yoshi2	second one teleports olimar up and then he goes back? o.o
2017-02-21 21:41:24	Yoshi2	or wait this can't be right
2017-02-21 21:41:30	Yoshi2	maybe that's the camera
2017-02-21 21:41:55	Yoshi2	yeah, camera. Olimar doesn't move
2017-02-21 21:43:13	Yoshi2	third one didn't do stuff (of course it didn't why would it it was a carbon copy of the second one when I checked in the cheat searcher
2017-02-21 21:45:41	@Espyo	neat
2017-02-21 21:49:14	Yoshi2	hmmmmmmmm
2017-02-21 21:52:31	Yoshi2	coordinates are the spookiest thing ever in pikmin 1
2017-02-21 21:57:21	@Espyo	yep
2017-02-21 22:00:15	Yoshi2	i really wonder why ralph's code isn't working properly
2017-02-21 22:00:29	Yoshi2	it seems to inject code properly and doesn't break the game
2017-02-21 22:03:49	@Espyo	no idea
2017-02-21 22:03:52	@Espyo	but your codes never really worked either
2017-02-21 22:03:54	@Espyo	dunno what's going on
2017-02-21 22:10:09	Yoshi2	:-(
2017-02-21 22:12:58	Yoshi2	did you use the US version of pikmin 1?
2017-02-21 22:14:03	@Espyo	mhm
2017-02-21 22:14:05	@Espyo	all throughout
2017-02-21 22:15:22	Yoshi2	I wonder if being on different days changes things
2017-02-21 22:15:43	Yoshi2	I'm on day 2
2017-02-21 22:15:53	Yoshi2	I'll start a new save
2017-02-21 22:17:14	Yoshi2	hm, still works on day 1
2017-02-21 22:17:53	@Espyo	phew
2017-02-21 22:21:33	Yoshi2	and you said the code worked for you (except for some weird behaviour but i will blame that on user error :> )
2017-02-21 22:22:27	@Espyo	it worked as well as swinging on a swing that's just a board of wood on the floor with chains attached
2017-02-21 22:23:19	Yoshi2	you could try making a new save and testing the code again
2017-02-21 22:24:19	@Espyo	iiiiiin a bit
2017-02-21 22:34:03	Yoshi2	WHAT THE FUCK
2017-02-21 22:34:14	Yoshi2	i messed with the ralph code a bit and somehow it keeps jumping
2017-02-21 22:34:28	@Espyo	like
2017-02-21 22:34:32	@Espyo	hop, hop, hop, hop?
2017-02-21 22:34:41	Yoshi2	bouncing
2017-02-21 22:34:44	Yoshi2	higher and higher
2017-02-21 22:34:53	Yoshi2	and when hitting angles jumps away at an angle
2017-02-21 22:35:59	@Espyo	uuuuuuhhhh
2017-02-21 22:36:04	@Espyo	I kinda got that behavior with YOUR code
2017-02-21 22:36:16	@Espyo	that's also KINDA what happens if you go out of bounds and bounce against walls
2017-02-21 22:36:20	@Espyo	it's...
2017-02-21 22:36:24	@Espyo	Pikmin's physics engine was a mistake :|
2017-02-21 22:38:13	Yoshi2	it gives me an idea, maybe this code is salvagable after all
2017-02-21 22:38:29	Yoshi2	(ralphs code i mean. My own is already perfectly working as far as i can tell :^) )
2017-02-21 22:40:11	Yoshi2	nevermind
2017-02-21 22:40:18	Yoshi2	can't recreate the bounce now
2017-02-21 22:46:57	@Espyo	making a new save file didn't change a thing
2017-02-21 22:47:11	@Espyo	your movement code still moves me automatically to one spot and I can't do anything about it
2017-02-21 22:47:21	@Espyo	your simple moon jump code still makes me jump without any button being involved
2017-02-21 22:47:39	Yoshi2	what the heck, do we have different revisions of the US version
2017-02-21 22:48:14	Yoshi2	what does dolphin tell you when you go to the game's properties under Info?

2017-02-21 22:49:30	@Espyo	a249(...)
2017-02-21 22:50:23	Yoshi2	hmm, same
2017-02-21 22:50:36	Yoshi2	weird
2017-02-21 22:51:16	@Espyo	are you booting the game with the code on, or activating it mid-flight?
2017-02-21 22:51:39	Yoshi2	booting it with the code on, otherwise the cheat doesn't even activate
2017-02-21 22:51:48	@Espyo	I can activate it during
2017-02-21 22:51:51	Yoshi2	at least dolphin tells me so
2017-02-21 22:52:03	@Espyo	but not via the right-click, properties, AR menu
2017-02-21 22:52:13	@Espyo	I have to go on tools, cheat manager
2017-02-21 22:52:17	@Espyo	enable it there and click apply
2017-02-21 22:52:25	@Espyo	but either way, I just tried from boot, and still the same thing
2017-02-21 22:52:39	Yoshi2	you added it as a gecko code right
2017-02-21 22:52:54	@Espyo	the only other difference... is running Dolphin on debug mode?
2017-02-21 22:53:01	@Espyo	ehrm
2017-02-21 22:53:04	@Espyo	I...didn't
2017-02-21 22:53:27	Yoshi2	add it as a gecko code
2017-02-21 22:53:29	@Espyo	ok, what exactly IS the difference between gecko and unobfuscated AR?
2017-02-21 22:54:07	Yoshi2	different capabilities, I THINK gecko is more powerful and can support bigger cheats
2017-02-21 22:56:15	Yoshi2	but yeah, if you added it as action replay it will malfunction because code types are different between the two
2017-02-21 22:56:26	@Espyo	aaaah
2017-02-21 22:57:40	@Espyo	although there's SOME overlap
2017-02-21 22:57:52	@Espyo	since I COULD move laterally a bit with Z+dpad
2017-02-21 22:59:15	@Espyo	ok, the code works as Gecko
2017-02-21 22:59:19	@Espyo	now I can say congrats
2017-02-21 22:59:21	Yoshi2	28XXXXXX is a if lower (unsigned) statement in AR while in gecko it's an if equal
2017-02-21 22:59:23	Yoshi2	yay
2017-02-21 22:59:33	@Espyo	although you should probably use A instead of Z
2017-02-21 22:59:40	@Espyo	my eyes and hears hurt after trying to moon jump :(
2017-02-21 22:59:47	Yoshi2	yeah, I noticed that
2017-02-21 23:00:14	Yoshi2	oh boy, so much pain caused by such a simple mistake
2017-02-21 23:00:36	@Espyo	you're excused 'cause it was proof-of-concept at first
2017-02-21 23:01:02	Yoshi2	i meant the AR/gecko mix-up
2017-02-21 23:01:11	@Espyo	ooooh, that
2017-02-21 23:01:12	@Espyo	heh, sorry
2017-02-21 23:01:18	@Espyo	yeah, well, now I know
2017-02-21 23:01:26	@Espyo	I never really gave gecko a second thought
2017-02-21 23:01:29	@Espyo	although I AM familiar with it
2017-02-21 23:01:36	@Espyo	since it's what I used on my actual Wii, with homebrew
2017-02-21 23:02:01	Yoshi2	AR codes can be converted to gecko, somebody wrote a program for that
2017-02-21 23:02:20	@Espyo	hm, probably not the other way around though, eh?
2017-02-21 23:06:15	Yoshi2	prooobably not, never tried it
2017-02-21 23:12:43	Yoshi2	damnit this ralph code must be salvagable somehow
2017-02-21 23:12:58	Yoshi2	I need to rewrite the assembler but I think it's legit
2017-02-21 23:13:11	@Espyo	ooh
2017-02-21 23:13:14	@Espyo	I hope
2017-02-21 23:13:32	Yoshi2	it seems to be good at retrieving the correct coordinates of olimar but fucks up at changing it
2017-02-21 23:15:43	Yoshi2	actually, heck
2017-02-21 23:17:07	Yoshi2	hmm
2017-02-21 23:17:19	Yoshi2	how do I go about rewriting this though
2017-02-21 23:18:20	@Espyo	wait, the addresses with TIS's acceleration
2017-02-21 23:18:24	@Espyo	is that actually the acceleration or the speed?
2017-02-21 23:18:26	@Espyo	seems like speed to me
2017-02-21 23:19:18	Yoshi2	yeah it's speed
2017-02-21 23:20:34	@Espyo	all right
2017-02-21 23:25:38	Yoshi2	ok I have a plan: based on whether the player pushes a button or not, at 0x80005020 I will add a branch that leads to a piece of code that changes the right address for vertical speed
2017-02-21 23:25:47	Yoshi2	and that will be for laaaaaaaaater
2017-02-21 23:25:54	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2017-02-21 23:26:01	Yoshi2|offline	damnit I should stop hacking at midnight
2017-02-21 23:27:07	Yoshi2|offline	but hacking is only really fun when when you are on :<
2017-02-21 23:27:31	@Espyo	hehe
2017-02-21 23:28:31	@Espyo	in the meantime, I've got the EU addresses
2017-02-21 23:28:33	@Espyo	that was easy
2017-02-21 23:28:37	Yoshi2|offline	nice
2017-02-21 23:28:43	@Espyo	speeds are 24 bytes before the coordinates
2017-02-21 23:28:48	@Espyo	so that's pretty nice
2017-02-21 23:48:15	@Espyo	actually, they're 0x24 bytes before
2017-02-21 23:48:20	@Espyo	just... just a correction

2017-02-22 19:21:42	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2017-02-22 19:55:31	@Espyo	hi
2017-02-22 19:56:44	Yoshi2	I spent SO much time trying to get the code to work
2017-02-22 19:56:47	Yoshi2	and i failed
2017-02-22 19:57:19	@Espyo	damn!
2017-02-22 19:57:50	Yoshi2	first attempt: change the vertical acceleration in code
2017-02-22 19:57:58	Yoshi2	didn't work out for some reason
2017-02-22 19:58:08	Yoshi2	*speed
2017-02-22 19:58:29	Yoshi2	vertical speed DID change but it didn't do anything (maybe the point of code injection is not great for that)
2017-02-22 19:59:20	Yoshi2	my second idea was to write the address for speed into a specific memory address
2017-02-22 19:59:32	Yoshi2	then change the speed through gecko
2017-02-22 20:00:03	Yoshi2	didn't quite work out
2017-02-22 20:01:46	Yoshi2	the address IS written to memory but the gecko stuff for reading that address and changing the value didn't work out for me yet
2017-02-22 20:26:20	@Espyo	ugh
2017-02-22 20:26:24	@Espyo	might as well forget the idea...
2017-02-22 20:26:32	@Espyo	and maybe try to find the addresses for all of the areas...
2017-02-22 21:22:40	Yoshi2	i'm not giving up yet
2017-02-22 21:22:42	Yoshi2	i got so far
2017-02-22 21:23:10	Yoshi2	all i need to do is to write a damn thing at the right address that is already loaded into a specific address in memory

2017-02-24 19:09:01	@Espyo	yeah...
2017-02-24 19:09:04	@Espyo	Testyo...
2017-02-24 19:09:05	Testyo	that has a lot of muscle and charisma
2017-02-24 19:09:14	@Espyo	what, kegels?
2017-02-24 19:09:41	Yoshi2	also I've heard you mention yesterday that testyo became more useless
2017-02-24 19:09:41	Testyo	and how see this though
2017-02-24 19:09:48	Yoshi2	because no more wiki fetching
2017-02-24 19:11:38	@Espyo	mhm
2017-02-24 19:11:46	@Espyo	HTTPS is hard :(
2017-02-24 19:11:58	@Espyo	speaking of, let me stop him from trying
2017-02-24 19:12:03	@Espyo	otherwise he keeps nagging the wikis every 5 minutes

2017-02-24 19:42:19	Yoshi2	Espyo: for the moonjump code, how bad would it be if the code had
2017-02-24 19:42:22	Yoshi2	uhhhm
2017-02-24 19:42:24	Yoshi2	side effects
2017-02-24 19:46:53	@Espyo	depends
2017-02-24 19:46:54	@Espyo	I mean
2017-02-24 19:46:57	@Espyo	depends on the person, really
2017-02-24 19:47:07	@Espyo	for me, I just wanted SOME way to move to out of access places
2017-02-24 19:47:18	@Espyo	and editing the coordinates in RAM is good enough for me
2017-02-24 19:47:31	@Espyo	so honestly, the moonjump code would just be icing on the cake, nothing else
2017-02-24 19:47:39	@Espyo	but other people could be waiting for a moon jump code...
2017-02-24 19:47:55	@Espyo	oh, I guess there's also the fact that I can't do free movement on ALL areas
2017-02-24 19:48:02	@Espyo	because the addresses you caught are for TIS only...
2017-02-24 19:51:00	Yoshi2	I should probably make a video about this
2017-02-24 19:51:25	@Espyo	what, about your development?
2017-02-24 19:51:29	@Espyo	or about the moonjump proper?
2017-02-24 19:51:36	Yoshi2	how the code is
2017-02-24 19:51:37	Yoshi2	uhm
2017-02-24 19:51:38	Yoshi2	working
2017-02-24 19:51:46	@Espyo	ugh, because that one guy asked on Discord?
2017-02-24 19:51:48	@Espyo	nuts to that
2017-02-24 19:51:51	@Espyo	don't waste your time
2017-02-24 19:51:55	@Espyo	it's a bloody moonjump code!
2017-02-24 19:51:56	Yoshi2	no i mean
2017-02-24 19:52:06	Yoshi2	so people can see the side effects
2017-02-24 19:52:25	@Espyo	ah, the side effects
2017-02-24 19:52:29	@Espyo	lol ok
2017-02-24 19:52:40	@Espyo	though
2017-02-24 19:52:43	@Espyo	a webm might work
2017-02-24 19:52:44	@Espyo	or a gif
2017-02-24 19:53:13	Yoshi2	no
2017-02-24 19:53:21	Yoshi2	it needs a full video
2017-02-24 19:55:23	@Espyo	yikes
2017-02-24 19:55:30	@Espyo	did you just poke random values in RAM?
2017-02-24 19:57:55	Yoshi2	no I think that is fine
2017-02-24 20:02:29	Yoshi2	the issue is probably with the injected code

2017-02-24 20:52:05	@Espyo	WHY IS THE BOMB ROCK
2017-02-24 20:52:59	@Espyo	so, basically...
2017-02-24 20:53:02	@Espyo	Olimar works fine
2017-02-24 20:53:10	@Espyo	but all mobile objects have their Y frozen at a certain value
2017-02-24 20:53:16	@Espyo	(0.0?)
2017-02-24 20:54:03	@Espyo	amazing stuff
2017-02-24 21:05:39	Yoshi2	mhm, seems that way
2017-02-24 21:36:44	Yoshi2	it must be the fault of the asm code
2017-02-24 21:36:53	Yoshi2	which will be a pain to fix but I have some ideas

2017-02-25 16:23:07	Yoshi2	... I removed a few things and turns out I probably shouldn't remove them because now the game doesn't start the level
2017-02-25 16:23:11	Yoshi2	music runs though
2017-02-25 16:23:13	Yoshi2	spooky
2017-02-25 16:26:09	@Espyo	eep
2017-02-25 16:29:00	@Espyo	https://twitter.com/Mother4Game/status/835381626112704513
2017-02-25 16:30:53	@Espyo	so I reworked some of the ways the engine was doing coordinates
2017-02-25 16:31:01	@Espyo	and ended up fixing a bug I didn't know existed, in the main game
2017-02-25 16:31:07	@Espyo	when your leader moves, the camera goes a bit to the front
2017-02-25 16:31:15	@Espyo	before, the leader's cursor happily moved to the front with the camera
2017-02-25 16:31:21	@Espyo	even if it meant going farther away from the leader than it should
2017-02-25 16:31:30	@Espyo	now, the cursor bobs behind the camera, like everything in the world
2017-02-25 16:31:32	@Espyo	as it should
2017-02-25 16:31:48	@Espyo	(well, the WORLD cursor, whereas the SCREEN cursor remains in the same spot on-screen)
2017-02-25 16:32:00	@Espyo	and this massive refactor worked right first time!
2017-02-25 16:32:01	@Espyo	...
2017-02-25 16:32:04	@Espyo	of course, just kidding
2017-02-25 16:32:16	@Espyo	the MAIN GAME changes worked right the first time
2017-02-25 16:32:21	@Espyo	the editors are completely broken
2017-02-25 16:32:28	@Espyo	moving the camera makes it move in all sorts of weird ways
2017-02-25 16:32:31	@Espyo	zooming out crops the everything
2017-02-25 16:32:33	@Espyo	it's off-center
2017-02-25 16:32:34	@Espyo	fun
2017-02-25 16:33:59	Yoshi2	"and this massive refactor worked right first time!"

2017-02-25 20:05:38	Neocraftz1553	I never really heard it by itself, with all the stomping going on, but it still complemented the battle.
2017-02-25 20:06:13	@Espyo	mhm
2017-02-25 20:09:49	Neocraftz1553	Oh, Espyo, will the Engine still build with later versions of Allegro or no?
2017-02-25 20:10:00	@Espyo	uhm, I think it should
2017-02-25 20:24:06	Yoshi2	Espyo: I got rid of the flying enemies issue and have posted the new cheat in the pikmin hacking chat now
2017-02-25 20:24:25	@Espyo	nice
2017-02-25 20:24:26	@Espyo	but
2017-02-25 20:24:32	@Espyo	I'm scared if it still has side effects
2017-02-25 20:24:42	@Espyo	ones that aren't immediately obvious...
2017-02-25 20:24:54	Yoshi2	dude
2017-02-25 20:24:57	Yoshi2	stop stealing my lines
2017-02-25 20:25:11	@Espyo	no, that's just telepathy
2017-02-25 20:26:09	Yoshi2	anyway, the main "potential side effect" is that the code writes the 32 bit value to a place it shouldn't write it to
2017-02-25 20:26:43	@Espyo	yeah, that sounds safe
2017-02-25 20:26:44	@Espyo	not
2017-02-25 20:26:53	Yoshi2	it isn't an issue in a level because inside a level the address will always point to olimar's upward speed
2017-02-25 20:27:03	@Espyo	hm
2017-02-25 20:27:04	@Espyo	you sure?
2017-02-25 20:27:09	@Espyo	oh, you should probably check challenge mode
2017-02-25 20:27:11	@Espyo	...
2017-02-25 20:27:16	@Espyo	and the unused levels, just in case :P
2017-02-25 20:28:03	Yoshi2	it COULD be an issue when in menus because the code has no way to detect if the player is in the menu or in a level
2017-02-25 20:28:13	@Espyo	right
2017-02-25 20:28:20	@Espyo	hmm
2017-02-25 20:28:31	@Espyo	well, it'd be safer if you moved the button elsewhere
2017-02-25 20:28:34	@Espyo	since A is so used
2017-02-25 20:28:37	@Espyo	Z is vomit
2017-02-25 20:28:40	Yoshi2	(on the initial start there is a 0 pointer check so at least on the first startup you will be fine)
2017-02-25 20:28:48	@Espyo	ah, nice
2017-02-25 20:29:02	Yoshi2	without the 0 pointer check dolphin will complain about invalid writes :P
2017-02-25 20:29:18	@Espyo	that makes sense, at least
2017-02-25 20:29:33	Yoshi2	<Espyo> oh, you should probably check challenge mode
2017-02-25 20:29:42	Yoshi2	no challenge mode in pikmin 1 as far as I can tell
2017-02-25 20:31:26	@Espyo	lies

2017-02-26 16:04:17	Testyo	I said repeatedly adding and dividing by 2 does not result in the same aswell but they got away because it was a timed random message. This random message came from the messages repeatedly adding and dividing by 2 does not result in the same value as if you add all together and then divide by 4 and l beat stage two aswell but they got away.
2017-02-26 19:08:52	Yoshi2	that guy is too busy to check if the exe I sent him still disappears or not, i am mildly upset :(

2017-02-26 19:26:02	Yoshi2	it was UPX compressed so I decompressed it and I wonder if his pc still doesn't like it
2017-02-26 19:26:10	@Espyo	that's called "most antiviruses are trash"
2017-02-26 19:26:41	Yoshi2	(I ran it through virustotal and 5 out of 57 detected it as malicious, and I never even heard of the ones that detected it as malicious)
2017-02-26 19:26:52	@Espyo	I'm starting to think it doesn't matter
2017-02-26 19:27:02	@Espyo	I think some antiviruses just go with the "shoot first, ask questions later" method
2017-02-26 19:28:37	Yoshi2	I just want to know if decompressing it does anything
2017-02-26 19:48:33	Yoshi2	Espyo: are there any other cheats that should exist but don't, or that exist but don't work?
2017-02-26 19:49:50	@Espyo	hmmmm
2017-02-26 19:49:52	@Espyo	I'm sure there must be
2017-02-26 19:49:57	@Espyo	but I can't think of any off the top of my head
2017-02-26 19:50:01	@Espyo	let me go through the lists
2017-02-26 19:50:59	@Espyo	what was all that about not being possible to set the day on P1?
2017-02-26 19:51:07	@Espyo	'cause I have this code here "Always on day 2", for the European version
2017-02-26 19:51:11	@Espyo	and it seems bundled with Dolphin
2017-02-26 19:52:41	@Espyo	oh, heh
2017-02-26 19:52:49	@Espyo	Ralf's P2 European moonjump code crashes the game
2017-02-26 19:57:59	Yoshi2	the day modifier code that is for the NA version of P1 doesn't work because it is off by some amount of bytes
2017-02-26 19:58:13	@Espyo	hm
2017-02-26 19:58:45	Yoshi2	quotebalrog had a working code and I realized the difference
2017-02-26 20:01:43	Yoshi2	european moonjump code crashing the game is lol
2017-02-26 20:01:56	Yoshi2	sounds like he thought "ok if i add an offset it will be fine" but never tested it

2017-02-27 18:40:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: you know what would be a fun cheat code
2017-02-27 18:40:19	Yoshi2	one that messes with the BMS parsing
2017-02-27 18:40:22	@Espyo	hah
2017-02-27 18:54:01	Yoshi2	would be definitely possible by code injection, only issue is preventing problematic edge cases
2017-02-27 19:01:01	@Espyo	erhm, what exactly are you planning on doing anyway?
2017-02-27 19:01:10	@Espyo	I mean, it has to be some specific instruction

2017-02-27 19:20:36	Yoshi2	injecting code at the point at which it reads note data
2017-02-27 19:26:44	Yoshi2	could change the note being played
2017-02-27 19:34:16	@Espyo	hmmm
2017-02-27 19:34:32	@Espyo	but how would you expect to do that?
2017-02-27 19:34:37	@Espyo	randomly poke addresses till you get it?
2017-02-27 19:34:47	@Espyo	or understand how the algorithm works via assembly?
2017-02-27 19:39:45	Yoshi2	[20:34:47] <Espyo> or understand how the algorithm works via assembly?
2017-02-27 19:40:01	Yoshi2	what did you think I was doing a while ago with BMS
2017-02-27 19:40:50	@Espyo	well, yeah, that's just it
2017-02-27 19:40:53	@Espyo	you tried to learn a bit
2017-02-27 19:41:00	@Espyo	and then just drowned in the endless sea of code
2017-02-27 19:41:08	@Espyo	but how would making cheat codes to mess with it help?
2017-02-27 19:41:16	@Espyo	how would you even know what addresses to change?
2017-02-27 19:41:46	@Espyo	you're trying to understand the code to help you poke memory addresses... to help you understand the code... to help you poke memory addresses?
2017-02-27 19:44:07	Yoshi2	the code will be mostly for fun and "because why not"
2017-02-27 19:44:20	@Espyo	well, all right
2017-02-27 19:44:22	@Espyo	can't say no to that
2017-02-27 19:44:28	@Espyo	still... you'd have to know where to poke...
2017-02-27 19:46:29	Yoshi2	with BMS I don't need addresses because addresses can be dynamic
2017-02-27 19:46:50	@Espyo	that's not reassuring :|
2017-02-27 19:47:00	Yoshi2	instead, I will alter the code and make it change the values in the registers
2017-02-27 19:47:19	@Espyo	what?! but that'll affect an entire game loop!
2017-02-27 19:49:04	Yoshi2	it will affect everything ( ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ) 
2017-02-27 19:49:14	@Espyo	but
2017-02-27 19:49:28	@Espyo	if everything is special, then nothing is special
2017-02-27 19:50:00	Yoshi2	my idea is that you could repeatedly shift notes by pressing a button
2017-02-27 19:50:38	@Espyo	and you plan on doing that by writing a code that, at the press of a button, increases the number on one of the registers?
2017-02-27 21:06:10	Yoshi2	yup
2017-02-27 21:07:24	Yoshi2	now, doing that directly as a cheat isn't possible (or you will break EVERYTHING) so what I'd need to do is inject code that reads a value from a memory address and adds that to the register with the necessary sanitizing
2017-02-27 21:07:31	Yoshi2	and the cheat writes to that memory address
2017-02-27 21:07:38	Yoshi2	kinda like what my p1 moonjump cheat does
2017-02-27 21:08:40	@Espyo	well... I still don't think it'll work
2017-02-27 21:08:42	@Espyo	but good luck
2017-02-27 21:09:15	Yoshi2	"well... I still don't think it'll work"
2017-02-27 21:09:21	Yoshi2	what's this
2017-02-27 21:09:24	Yoshi2	a challenge?
2017-02-27 21:09:37	Yoshi2	oh it's ON
2017-02-27 21:10:58	Yoshi2	not today though because today i have to sleep
2017-02-27 21:11:06	@Espyo	oh well, in that case, I REEEEEEALLY don't think you'll be able to whatsoeeeever

2017-02-28 20:15:07	Yoshi2	 Showing with 2,376 additions and 2,358 deletions. 
2017-02-28 20:15:22	@Espyo	I tried scrolling down a bit
2017-02-28 20:15:26	@Espyo	my browser froze for 5 seconds
2017-02-28 20:15:39	@Espyo	that was the clearest "here be dragons" sign I've ever read in my life
2017-02-28 20:34:28	Yoshi2	code injection was a success
2017-02-28 20:34:57	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2017-02-28 20:34:58	@Espyo	but
2017-02-28 20:35:02	@Espyo	what did you get to happen then?
2017-02-28 20:40:10	Yoshi2	nothing yet except loading an address into register r3 without issues
2017-02-28 20:40:20	@Espyo	hm
2017-02-28 20:40:23	Yoshi2	(the register is overwritten afterwards anyway so I can do whatever with it)
2017-02-28 20:40:47	Yoshi2	(I know that because I checked the code that follows)
2017-02-28 20:41:07	@Espyo	hm, all right
2017-02-28 20:52:19	@Espyo	Yoshi2: https://github.com/RenolY2/j3dview
2017-02-28 20:52:30	@Espyo	>ImportError: No module named 'gx.texture'
2017-02-28 20:52:31	@Espyo	any ideas?
2017-02-28 20:52:53	Yoshi2	how about this: you screwed up 
2017-02-28 20:53:01	@Espyo	I don't like that idea
2017-02-28 20:53:35	Yoshi2	https://github.com/RenolY2/j3dview/tree/master/gx oh it's the pyx thing
2017-02-28 20:54:13	@Espyo	uh, meaning...?
2017-02-28 20:54:43	Yoshi2	pyx is not a native python thing. I THINK it was something made possible by cython
2017-02-28 20:55:45	@Espyo	...why don't I have pip3 all of a sudden
2017-02-28 20:55:55	@Espyo	I ran through your instructions just the other day
2017-02-28 20:56:01	@Espyo	and now I'm trying them again
2017-02-28 20:56:03	@Espyo	but I don't have pip3
2017-02-28 20:56:04	@Espyo	what
2017-02-28 20:57:17	Yoshi2	Have you installed all the dependencies I listed in the readme?
2017-02-28 20:57:52	@Espyo	yeah
2017-02-28 20:59:28	Yoshi2	have you ran setup.py?
2017-02-28 20:59:56	@Espyo	I used the other method
2017-02-28 21:01:34	Yoshi2	with uncommenting two lines in j3dview.py?
2017-02-28 21:02:24	@Espyo	they were already commented out
2017-02-28 21:03:34	Yoshi2	uhm I mean
2017-02-28 21:03:52	Yoshi2	removing the comment
2017-02-28 21:03:54	Yoshi2	#
2017-02-28 21:04:04	@Espyo	................
2017-02-28 21:04:08	@Espyo	well then
2017-02-28 21:04:25	@Espyo	that is 100% my fault
2017-02-28 21:04:48	@Espyo	it works
2017-02-28 21:04:49	@Espyo	thanks, and sorry
2017-02-28 21:04:57	Yoshi2	yay
2017-02-28 21:09:02	@Espyo	well, with that out of the way...
2017-02-28 21:09:06	@Espyo	j3dview seems... okay, I guess
2017-02-28 21:13:36	Yoshi2	a bit prettier in some ways
2017-02-28 21:14:32	Yoshi2	and python
2017-02-28 21:20:27	Yoshi2	ok everything is set, time to test my code
2017-02-28 21:21:19	Yoshi2	step 1: check if it crashes
2017-02-28 21:21:39	Yoshi2	step 2: celebrate because getting past 1 is a HUGE feat
2017-02-28 21:24:47	Yoshi2	step 3: oh hey it works
2017-02-28 21:24:56	Yoshi2	the assembler part seems to be fine
2017-02-28 21:33:57	Yoshi2	hehehe
2017-02-28 21:34:46	Yoshi2	it works, I just need to add gecko stuff to make button presses increase or decrease the value at a specific point
2017-02-28 21:35:04	Yoshi2	then the assembler loads the value into the register holding the note value
2017-02-28 21:35:22	Yoshi2	does sanitizing so that it's still in the 0x00-0x7F range
2017-02-28 21:35:22	Testyo	7 F = -13.8889 °C / 259.261 K
2017-02-28 21:35:37	Yoshi2	and done 👌 
2017-02-28 21:37:08	@Espyo	I can't believe you actually did it
2017-02-28 21:37:09	@Espyo	well done!
2017-02-28 21:38:08	Yoshi2	I am suprised that it worked so well
2017-02-28 21:39:29	Yoshi2	also the code doesn't discriminate
2017-02-28 21:39:38	Yoshi2	everything is affected that plays a note of sorts
2017-02-28 21:41:26	@Espyo	nice
2017-02-28 21:43:45	Yoshi2	or at least many things
2017-02-28 21:50:37	Yoshi2	finishing it tomorrow, then I will probably have to port it to US, make a video about it and rake in those sweet internet point
2017-02-28 21:50:39	Yoshi2	s

2017-03-01 19:11:49	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-03-01 19:11:50	Testyo	dunno, think that enemy should be one pixel more to the left"
2017-03-01 19:35:40	@Espyo	hi
2017-03-01 19:36:17	Claris	Well if any of you are weird and care about Metroid Prime 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u-7mZO69E8

2017-03-01 19:37:53	@Espyo	well, I care more about MP3 shenanigans videos than runs for the game
2017-03-01 19:37:56	@Espyo	but still, niiiice
2017-03-01 19:38:01	@Espyo	wish I had the time to see it
2017-03-01 19:38:08	@Espyo	but just the time sounds great
2017-03-01 19:38:09	@Espyo	nice work
2017-03-01 19:54:48	Yoshi2	Espyo: I posted the finished code on discord (with a hacker mention) earlier today
2017-03-01 19:54:59	Yoshi2	didn't make a video about it yet
2017-03-01 19:55:34	@Espyo	very nice
2017-03-01 19:55:43	@Espyo	you need to make a video of it
2017-03-01 19:55:45	@Espyo	but
2017-03-01 19:56:11	@Espyo	how similar is the behavior to this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d_qPw1mz7o
2017-03-01 20:08:34	Yoshi2	"how similar is the behavior to this" dont fucking do this to me after i spent like a day or two of work q-q
2017-03-01 20:10:46	@Espyo	|:
2017-03-01 20:11:24	Yoshi2	well, it is kinda similar except my code is much cooler
2017-03-01 20:11:45	@Espyo	AND it works for the GameCube
2017-03-01 20:12:18	Yoshi2	my code allows you to change the pitch in real time
2017-03-01 20:12:35	Yoshi2	and it has similar side effects
2017-03-01 20:12:57	Yoshi2	which change based on how much you press the button for increasing the modifier
2017-03-01 20:18:10	Yoshi2	most of my code is just button conditionals to have a smooth experience
2017-03-01 20:18:23	Yoshi2	with 6 lines being the asm inection
2017-03-01 20:26:04	Yoshi2	also me and pidi64 made progress on the .mod format of p1
2017-03-01 20:34:41	@Espyo	oh?
2017-03-01 20:43:37	Yoshi2	yes
2017-03-01 20:43:57	Yoshi2	if you checked the pikmin hacking channel you'd see walls of text of us writing stuff

2017-03-01 22:04:10	@Espyo	GAAAAAAAH
2017-03-01 22:04:21	@Espyo	Yoshi2: how do I fucking remove a character from a string in Python?
2017-03-01 22:04:23	@Espyo	I've got the string "abc"
2017-03-01 22:04:26	@Espyo	I want to remove the middle element
2017-03-01 22:04:28	@Espyo	what is the code?
2017-03-01 22:04:53	@Espyo	google either shows a trillion results for removing the last character, which I happen to know because of Python array magic
2017-03-01 22:05:08	Yoshi2	is it always a three character string?
2017-03-01 22:05:15	@Espyo	or has results with stackoverflow people recommending you rebuild the universe from scratch in order to create a string with the missing character
2017-03-01 22:05:18	@Espyo	no
2017-03-01 22:05:26	@Espyo	any string, I want to remove the character in position "n"
2017-03-01 22:05:31	Yoshi2	oh
2017-03-01 22:05:43	@Espyo	something like my_string = my_string.erase(n) or something?
2017-03-01 22:05:55	Yoshi2	strings are immutable in python so essentially you will always be making a new string
2017-03-01 22:06:03	@Espyo	that's... fair
2017-03-01 22:06:15	@Espyo	but regardless, what would be the instruction?
2017-03-01 22:07:22	Yoshi2	newstring = string[:n]+string[n+1:] maybe?
2017-03-01 22:07:33	Yoshi2	or string[:n-1]+string[n:]
2017-03-01 22:08:48	Yoshi2	haven't counted to see which one removes exactly the nth character
2017-03-01 22:14:13	Yoshi2	(well, it's probably jut a matter of 1- or 0-indexing
2017-03-01 22:20:21	@Espyo	why is it so convoluted? ;_;
2017-03-01 22:20:35	@Espyo	though I guess it makes a world of sense
2017-03-01 22:22:32	Yoshi2	it's not convoluted
2017-03-01 22:23:06	@Espyo	in C++ it's my_string = my_string.erase(n);
2017-03-01 22:23:16	@Espyo	if C++ makes things easier than your language, you KNOW you've got it wrong
2017-03-01 22:23:16	Yoshi2	the way arrays work in python, bla[0:5] will include elements starting at position 0 and up to but excluding 5
2017-03-01 22:23:26	@Espyo	I know, I know, and I get that, and I think it makes sense
2017-03-01 22:23:29	@Espyo	but it's still convoluted
2017-03-01 22:24:43	Yoshi2	if you had an array, removing the nth element would be as easy as del bla[n]
2017-03-01 22:25:50	@Espyo	oh
2017-03-01 22:25:50	Yoshi2	python strings are immutable so you can't have that
2017-03-01 22:25:54	@Espyo	I see
2017-03-01 22:31:32	@Espyo	erhm
2017-03-01 22:31:49	@Espyo	the string that I'm getting from somewhere else (probably not important) is returning with a line break at the end
2017-03-01 22:32:06	@Espyo	oh, I see where I went wrong
2017-03-01 22:32:07	@Espyo	never mind
2017-03-01 22:46:20	Yoshi2	all those people being hyped about p1 and i'm here thinking
2017-03-01 22:46:43	Yoshi2	"wtf why do people care"
2017-03-01 22:46:55	@Espyo	lol
2017-03-01 22:47:02	@Espyo	because it's a little box of secrets for over 15 years
2017-03-01 22:47:12	@Espyo	and you're just dangling the key around
2017-03-01 22:48:08	Yoshi2	fair enough
2017-03-01 22:51:20	Yoshi2	but damn, we'll be lucky if this gets far enough to have edge data read properly
2017-03-01 22:53:47	@Espyo	hmm
2017-03-01 22:56:55	Yoshi2	porting between bmd and mod? Make custom models into mod? hahahahaha
2017-03-01 22:57:02	Yoshi2	what is a sanity, can i eat it?
2017-03-01 22:57:41	@Espyo	hey, dream high while you can
2017-03-01 22:57:43	@Espyo	and most of all

2017-03-02 18:53:22	Testyo	I get that he's trying to help, but having to explain what water is before he tells me how to bake a minute
2017-03-02 18:53:57	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm 2
2017-03-02 18:53:58	Testyo	I said hi because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages hi and hi. They were joined by the common word hi.
2017-03-02 18:56:39	Yoshi2	ugh pikmin 1 is unplayable
2017-03-02 18:56:48	Yoshi2	why do pikmin turn white if I don't command them

2017-03-02 18:57:07	@Espyo	that's what being idle is all about

2017-03-02 18:59:43	Yoshi2	what if I don't want to keep them in command?
2017-03-02 18:59:50	Yoshi2	pretty sure pikmin 3 did it right

2017-03-02 19:01:12	@Espyo	it's just that in P1 they turn albino
2017-03-02 19:01:23	Yoshi2	yeah I hate them turning albino
2017-03-02 19:01:44	@Espyo	why?
2017-03-02 19:01:45	@Espyo	...racist?
2017-03-02 19:02:46	Yoshi2	i hate white people white people are the worst
2017-03-02 19:03:12	Yoshi2	on a serious note, it annoys me because I want them to stay the color they are
2017-03-02 19:03:47	@Espyo	but whyyyyy
2017-03-02 19:04:11	Yoshi2	because  that way I can tell they are red pikmin
2017-03-02 19:04:25	@Espyo	*shrug* yeah I guess

2017-03-02 19:18:37	@Espyo	I didn't know I was searching for it

2017-03-02 20:23:17	@Espyo	:(
2017-03-02 20:33:12	Yoshi2	but dont worry eventually I will add the video so all 4 people in the world will be able to understand the format

2017-03-02 22:36:19	@Espyo	J, Yoshi2|offline: would you happen to know how I'd launch a script in a fire-and-forget kind of way?
2017-03-02 22:36:22	@Espyo	in Python
2017-03-02 22:37:02	@Espyo	I've looked into it, and I have a script that, given a file, moves that file into an http server folder, then gets my IP address, and generates a URL pointing to that file
2017-03-02 22:37:21	@Espyo	since I'm getting rid of dropbox, I'll need an alternative way to quickly share images or text files
2017-03-02 22:37:42	@Espyo	pCloud, the alternative I'm going for, allows file sharing, but not with direct links, so it'll be really cumbersome when I want to share fast things...
2017-03-02 22:38:01	@Espyo	anyway, the idea would be that I'd be running an http server using SimpleHTTPServer
2017-03-02 22:38:14	@Espyo	I've tested, and it does what I want without any real hard work
2017-03-02 22:38:17	@Espyo	so it's pretty perfect!
2017-03-02 22:38:20	@Espyo	but my idea was:
2017-03-02 22:38:30	@Espyo	I can go days without needing to immediately share something
2017-03-02 22:39:02	@Espyo	so what if the script that runs SimpleHTTPServer, instead of always being ran at machine boot, was only ran when I ran the file move+url script?
2017-03-02 22:39:24	@Espyo	so, the http server script would launch the server, and do .serve_forever() till interrupted
2017-03-02 22:39:40	@Espyo	and the share script would move the file, generate a URL, and start the server
2017-03-02 22:39:52	@Espyo	(if the server's already up, binding the port will fail, so it works anyway)
2017-03-02 22:39:55	@Espyo	now, my problem is:
2017-03-02 22:40:03	@Espyo	I dunno how I'd run the server from the share script
2017-03-02 22:40:06	@Espyo	I've found a few ways
2017-03-02 22:40:09	@Espyo	but they're all synchronous
2017-03-02 22:40:14	@Espyo	in that when the share script ends, the server script ends
2017-03-02 22:40:17	@Espyo	I don't want that

2017-03-02 22:44:12	Testyo	THAT file is unused and I didn't stick it in TCRF yet
2017-03-02 22:44:12	Neocraftz1553	lol

2017-03-02 22:45:04	@Espyo	yep
2017-03-02 22:50:19	Neocraftz1553	 Hey Espyo, you know how on the first and second game's titles you can see the Pikmin under their flowers?
2017-03-02 22:50:52	@Espyo	I think one of the games only shows the flowers, and the other shows tiny dots colored after each Pikmin ype
2017-03-02 22:50:53	@Espyo	*type
2017-03-02 22:51:14	Neocraftz1553	Wait, let me check...
2017-03-02 22:51:58	Neocraftz1553	time to go...
2017-03-02 22:51:59	Neocraftz1553	into 4k
2017-03-02 22:51:59	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2017-03-02 22:53:17	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, Pikmin one has Flowers only
2017-03-02 22:53:34	Neocraftz1553	Let's check 2
2017-03-02 22:54:29	Neocraftz1553	Not really sure about 2, but you can see some colors under the Flowers.
2017-03-02 22:54:45	@Espyo	that's likely it then
2017-03-02 22:55:23	Neocraftz1553	Anyways, I think I could try to make a swaying animation for the engine as well as a custom background for it(like the first and second one's)
2017-03-02 22:56:15	@Espyo	ah, I guess so
2017-03-02 22:56:21	@Espyo	but remember, the title screen of the engine is meant to be a placeholder
2017-03-02 22:56:27	@Espyo	that's where the game's maker would place their game's title screen
2017-03-02 22:56:36	@Espyo	"PFE" isn't a game, it's just a simple show-off title screen
2017-03-02 22:59:00	Neocraftz1553	Anything's a game, if you're brave enough :P
2017-03-02 23:01:32	Neocraftz1553	Still, it couldn't hurt to make it a bit more attractive
2017-03-02 23:01:38	Neocraftz1553	Not saying it's not, but still
2017-03-02 23:02:20	@Espyo	it's okay, it really isn't attractive
2017-03-02 23:02:36	@Espyo	no animation on the engine is really attractive, but I think quite a few of them are at least passable
2017-03-02 23:02:45	@Espyo	but the title screen?
2017-03-02 23:02:48	@Espyo	oh no, that one is just actual garbage
2017-03-02 23:02:53	@Espyo	*shrug*
2017-03-02 23:03:47	Neocraftz1553	http://imgur.com/iIQ5vOj I'm beautiful, right owo
2017-03-02 23:04:03	Neocraftz1553	Hueh
2017-03-02 23:04:56	Neocraftz1553	Eh, it's in it's early stages, it'll get better as time progresses.
2017-03-02 23:05:24	Neocraftz1553	'sides, the enemies and stuff fit the engine quite well, although, it might be because everything's like that.
2017-03-02 23:05:26	@Espyo	hehe
2017-03-02 23:05:30	@Espyo	yeah, it'll improve
2017-03-02 23:05:41	Neocraftz1553	Hmm...
2017-03-02 23:05:46	@Espyo	yeah, that's why I'm at least adamant about keeping a consist art style
2017-03-02 23:05:52	@Espyo	it may not be beautiful, but at least it's consistent
2017-03-02 23:06:22	Neocraftz1553	What if I make a texture pack of the engine's current objects with blender?
2017-03-02 23:06:27	Neocraftz1553	Heh, I wonder how that'll look
2017-03-02 23:07:00	Neocraftz1553	I think it's in-game graphics are fine, it makes creating enemies worlds easier.
2017-03-02 23:09:42	@Espyo	yeah
2017-03-02 23:09:47	@Espyo	it'd probably look a bit out of place
2017-03-02 23:09:58	@Espyo	though the textures used are already realistic, compared to the cartoony sprites
2017-03-02 23:10:37	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2017-03-02 23:11:35	Neocraftz1553	and so, a madman's journey begins: http://imgur.com/I7Xhhck
2017-03-02 23:12:14	Neocraftz1553	I'll try it with the Red Bulborb first, and if it looks alright, I'll try reskinning everything else

2017-03-03 20:18:11	@J	Espyo: you could have it run at boot, but only start listening when you send a signal to it; otherwise I don't see why just 'command &' in a shell script wouldn't work
2017-03-03 20:30:41	@Espyo	huh, good point
2017-03-03 20:30:51	@Espyo	the run at boot part rubs me slightly the wrong way, since I don't always need to share stuff
2017-03-03 20:30:55	@Espyo	less often than not, really
2017-03-03 20:31:01	@Espyo	but the command part should make sense
2017-03-03 20:31:24	@Espyo	I've set it up so that I can right-click a file on the explorer, choose Open With, and select my script
2017-03-03 20:31:31	@Espyo	I'll see if it's possible to && two commands
2017-03-03 20:31:48	@Espyo	forgot what the explorer's name is for Lubuntu, but I remember it's really messed up
2017-03-03 20:31:57	@Espyo	PCManFM
2017-03-03 21:43:08	@J	&, not &&
2017-03-03 21:43:41	@J	you should be able to have your script be a file, and just put whatever you want in there
2017-03-03 21:44:03	@Espyo	uh, force of habit
2017-03-03 21:44:07	@Espyo	yeah, & does two commands
2017-03-03 21:44:14	@Espyo	...oh, duh >_>
2017-03-03 21:44:16	@Espyo	forgot about that
2017-03-03 21:44:19	@Espyo	it
2017-03-03 21:44:21	@Espyo	it completely went over my mind
2017-03-03 21:44:26	@Espyo	I've done it with other things too
2017-03-03 21:44:29	@Espyo	aww geez I feel dumb
2017-03-03 21:44:51	@J	you have to start it with '#! /bin/bash' (or another shell) and make it executable
2017-03-03 21:48:39	@Espyo	yeah
2017-03-03 21:48:46	@Espyo	also, as I've learned...
2017-03-03 21:48:49	@Espyo	add a line break to the end
2017-03-03 21:48:54	@Espyo	AND make sure line breaks aren't in windows format
2017-03-03 21:49:13	@J	most text editors will do that stuff by default
2017-03-03 21:52:00	@Espyo	keyword most
2017-03-03 21:52:09	@Espyo	Notepad++ won't
2017-03-03 21:52:15	@Espyo	well, I can make it at least set the default EOL
2017-03-03 21:52:22	@Espyo	but I had a good reason to keep the windows version
2017-03-03 21:52:24	@Espyo	can't remember what
2017-03-03 22:01:35	@Espyo	hey, wait
2017-03-03 22:01:46	@Espyo	won't a & b only run b when a returns?
2017-03-03 22:02:03	@Espyo	a, the http server, is meant to stay there forever, serving the...server
2017-03-03 22:06:05	@J	I don't think you get it
2017-03-03 22:06:27	@J	what is it meant to do, copy the file then start the server then copy the path to clipboard?
2017-03-03 22:06:29	@J	something like that?
2017-03-03 22:07:27	@Espyo	yeah
2017-03-03 22:07:56	@J	then you want: 'cp "$src_path" "$dest_path"\nstart_server &\necho "$src_path" | xclip ...'
2017-03-03 22:08:04	@Espyo	woah woah
2017-03-03 22:08:13	@J	I did \n to make it fit on one line
2017-03-03 22:08:14	@Espyo	I got it done with just Python, no biggie
2017-03-03 22:08:40	@J	oh, okay
2017-03-03 22:08:44	@Espyo	my only problem was running both the script that keeps the server up, and keeping that script running, and then also run a script that generates the URL
2017-03-03 22:10:17	@J	wait
2017-03-03 22:10:36	@J	so you mean you just need 'start_server &\npython do_the_stuff.py'
2017-03-03 22:12:37	@Espyo	yep
2017-03-03 22:12:47	@Espyo	unless
2017-03-03 22:12:54	@Espyo	like I said, start_server is meant to keep running
2017-03-03 22:12:56	@Espyo	will it work?
2017-03-03 22:13:24	@Espyo	ah, so it will
2017-03-03 22:13:35	@J	what & does it run it in the background
2017-03-03 22:13:36	@Espyo	I did ping google.com & echo done
2017-03-03 22:13:40	@J	it's literally what you asked for
2017-03-03 22:13:41	@Espyo	right
2017-03-03 22:13:45	@Espyo	yeah, it is

2017-03-03 22:14:19	@Espyo	and we use "front" to bring it back...?

2017-03-03 22:14:26	@Espyo	sweet, thanks
2017-03-03 22:14:55	@J	there are weird rules depending on if the shell is interactive or not, and sometimes people use 'disown' or 'nohup', but I find & is usually fine on its own
2017-03-03 22:15:24	@Espyo	I hope I don't run into any of those
2017-03-03 22:15:31	@Espyo	but if I do, at least now I know the name of alternative solutions
2017-03-03 22:15:31	@Espyo	thanks

2017-03-03 22:35:52	@Espyo	looks like the server gets killed as soon as the "Open With" command ends
2017-03-03 22:36:00	@Espyo	screw it, I'll just start the server at boot
2017-03-03 22:37:24	@Espyo	hm, to do that, I'll want to chain a cd to the script's execution
2017-03-03 22:37:30	@Espyo	otherwise it'll just mount the server on the root
2017-03-03 22:37:31	@Espyo	that's no good

2017-03-03 22:38:02	@Espyo	I can probably do "cd /home/andre/http_server & python /home/andre/http_server/server.py"
2017-03-03 22:38:11	@Espyo	but I wonder how well that'll actually work...
2017-03-03 22:40:00	@J	you should be able to set the working directory when configuring the thing that runs it
2017-03-03 22:40:16	@Espyo	inside the script itself?
2017-03-03 22:40:18	@Espyo	might as well do that
2017-03-03 22:40:22	@J	no, outside
2017-03-03 22:40:31	@Espyo	doesn't look like I can
2017-03-03 22:40:36	@J	wherever you stick the path to the script, there should be an option to set the working directory
2017-03-03 22:40:43	@J	you would hope so, anyway
2017-03-03 22:40:54	@Espyo	this is just the autostart file, so I can probably just slap a cd in there anyway
2017-03-03 22:40:58	@J	otherwise you could make the script take it as an argument
2017-03-03 22:41:13	@Espyo	yeah
2017-03-03 22:41:17	@Espyo	which actually might even be for the best
2017-03-03 22:41:26	@J	anyway, in this case you actually do want && instead of &
2017-03-03 22:41:27	@Espyo	I could want to run the script from whatever, but only mount my server folder
2017-03-03 22:41:42	@Espyo	right, I was gonna ask "isn't there something like a && that makes sure that the first command is run?"
2017-03-03 22:41:53	@Espyo	that IS what && is meant to do, right? wait for command #1 before doing #2
2017-03-03 22:43:24	@J	& is closer to ; than to &&
2017-03-03 22:43:32	@J	...somewhat
2017-03-03 22:43:50	@J	okay, ; or \n waits for the command to finish then runs the next thing
2017-03-03 22:44:05	@J	&& waits for the command to finish, then only runs the next thing if the command succeeded
2017-03-03 22:44:14	@J	& backgrounds the command and runs the next thing straight away
2017-03-03 22:44:19	@Espyo	ah, gotcha
2017-03-03 22:44:30	@Espyo	hmm, by the by, what would count as a command succeeding?
2017-03-03 22:44:34	@J	|| is like && but opposite
2017-03-03 22:44:39	@J	if the exit code is 0
2017-03-03 22:44:44	@Espyo	thought so
2017-03-03 22:44:47	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2017-03-03 22:44:51	@J	as in, 0 is the only success code, all others are failures
2017-03-03 22:44:56	@Espyo	right
2017-03-03 22:45:10	@Espyo	that's why they teach you in school to use return 0, but use return 1, return 2, return whatever in error cases
2017-03-03 22:45:18	@Espyo	but they never really tell you WHY you should use them...
2017-03-03 22:45:21	@Espyo	so far, all I had were hunches
2017-03-03 22:45:35	@Espyo	plus, you know, living in the windows world, this never mattered
2017-03-03 22:45:40	@J	yeah
2017-03-03 22:45:42	@Espyo	I don't think exit codes are used for a single thing
2017-03-03 22:45:50	@Espyo	but here, we've got scripting magic

2017-03-05 14:01:39	Testyo	so while he can say that to get a keyboard around?
2017-03-05 14:01:50	Yoshi2	how was your 13 hour sleep
2017-03-05 14:03:33	@Espyo	hi
2017-03-05 14:03:44	@Espyo	well, I slept at 1, woke up today at midday
2017-03-05 14:03:45	@Espyo	so 11 hours
2017-03-05 14:03:48	@Espyo	buuuuut
2017-03-05 14:03:53	@Espyo	it was kinda fulfilling
2017-03-05 14:03:55	@Espyo	should've been more
2017-03-05 14:08:54	Yoshi2	"should've been more" so you mean if it was up to you you'd wake up at 16 or 17 my time? 👀
2017-03-05 14:10:14	@Espyo	hey, probably
2017-03-05 14:10:31	@Espyo	well, maybe not this time
2017-03-05 14:10:36	@Espyo	I think I only needed like one more hour today
2017-03-05 14:10:38	@Espyo	but some days...
2017-03-05 14:10:42	@Espyo	I feel like I can sleep an entire day
2017-03-05 14:10:46	@Espyo	and I don't even have to be tired
2017-03-05 14:13:50	Yoshi2	more time spent sleeping is less time spent playing AWESOME VIDEO GAMES like ZELDA
2017-03-05 14:16:30	@Espyo	I have the Switch, but they were out of stock on Zelda
2017-03-05 14:16:39	@Espyo	so I just have a 320€ brick right now :X
2017-03-05 14:16:40	Testyo	320 € = £ 226.112  / $ 347.904 
2017-03-05 14:19:34	Yoshi2	wtf you have switch but no zelda
2017-03-05 14:19:38	Yoshi2	how is that possible
2017-03-05 14:20:13	@Espyo	out of stock
2017-03-05 14:20:34	@Espyo	that retailer had a great deal where you'd only pay 330€ for both the console and the game
2017-03-05 14:20:34	Testyo	330 € = £ 233.178  / $ 358.776 
2017-03-05 14:20:45	@Espyo	but they HELPFULLY forgot to tell us they don't have the game in stock
2017-03-05 14:20:49	@Espyo	we only realized when we got home
2017-03-05 14:21:08	@Espyo	now they'll send us a phone call or something when they get it in stock so we can go pick it up
2017-03-05 14:21:09	@Espyo	frankly...
2017-03-05 14:26:05	Marty2000	I had to change the security of my Internet to connect the Switch. It doesn't accept WPA PSK, so I switched to Wep and had to reconnect all my devices
2017-03-05 14:26:17	@Espyo	ouch
2017-03-05 14:26:43	Yoshi2	huh, weird
2017-03-05 14:26:53	Yoshi2	and your router can't do WPA2?
2017-03-05 14:27:13	Marty2000	It can, but not all of my devices accept it I think
2017-03-05 14:27:25	Yoshi2	wep isn't secure so that shouldn't be a permanent solution
2017-03-05 14:28:44	Marty2000	Mhm. I'll see if I can find another solution. For now, it's ok. 
2017-03-05 14:29:05	Marty2000	I also bought Zelda, I had never really played the series but it's nice. I like it :P
2017-03-05 14:29:34	@Espyo	the series isn't like that, so BotW isn't a good indicator
2017-03-05 14:30:07	Marty2000	Yeah, I know, I read that on some websites. I think that's why I bought it

2017-03-20 19:13:16	Yoshi2	here is a rage inducing thread about a guy who is upset that romhacks.net doesn't want people to upload dick hacks https://www.reddit.com/r/romhacking/comments/5zyx99/elitism_assholery_where_do_i_not_find_that/
2017-03-20 19:17:42	@Espyo	eeeeehhh
2017-03-20 19:17:44	@Espyo	there's no real answer
2017-03-20 19:17:50	@Espyo	if they accepted any hack, that's cool
2017-03-20 19:17:58	@Espyo	if they didn't, that's cool, in that they want to keep an image
2017-03-20 19:18:12	@Espyo	that guy's crying like if RHDN was the ONLY place to host hacks on
2017-03-20 19:18:14	@Espyo	what is an internets?

2017-03-20 19:21:41	@Espyo	typical, really
2017-03-20 19:22:00	Yoshi2	also RHDN deserved the attack recently

2017-03-25 13:56:01	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-03-25 13:56:01	Testyo	and I thought to myself, "why has nobody added this to the same with d-throw up air
2017-03-25 13:57:32	@Espyo	hi
2017-03-25 15:11:01	Yoshi2	Espyo: the 3d ripper dx tool is really cool, managed to do this: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/188322587116306433/295133988186488842/unknown.png
2017-03-25 15:11:14	@Espyo	mhm, I've seen
2017-03-25 15:11:16	@Espyo	but it's pretty janky
2017-03-25 15:11:25	@Espyo	also very selective about what things it likes and doesn't like to rip
2017-03-25 15:11:29	@Espyo	at least that's how it was back in the day
2017-03-25 15:11:35	@Espyo	like 4 years ago when I last use dit
2017-03-25 15:11:37	@Espyo	*used it
2017-03-25 15:15:04	Yoshi2	I had to unskew the thing manually
2017-03-25 15:15:28	Yoshi2	does beat not having a proper model viewer
2017-03-25 15:15:40	Yoshi2	but it is not completely without fault, yeah
2017-03-25 15:16:01	Yoshi2	still, really cool
2017-03-25 15:16:20	Yoshi2	(also obviously it will only render the stuff that the game renders, the same way the game renders it)
2017-03-25 15:16:46	@Espyo	yeah
2017-03-25 15:16:58	@Espyo	useful in a pinch, but not for professional model ripping
2017-03-25 15:16:59	@Espyo	ah well
2017-03-25 15:21:02	Yoshi2	with some effort plenty useful for regular model ripping though
2017-03-25 15:21:05	Yoshi2	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/188322587116306433/295184037557960704/unknown.png
2017-03-25 15:21:29	Yoshi2	needs fixing up but that's better than having to redo the model from 0
2017-03-25 15:24:14	Yoshi2	it's even broken up into parts so you can attempt to animate it
2017-03-25 15:24:41	@Espyo	hm, good point
2017-03-25 18:02:04	Yoshi2	you know what infuriates me
2017-03-25 18:02:12	Yoshi2	I was looking for a function in blender
2017-03-25 18:02:13	@Espyo	mmmhmm?
2017-03-25 18:02:24	Yoshi2	that gets rid of vertices that are on top of each other
2017-03-25 18:02:47	Yoshi2	because my model has a duplicate of itelf on top of itself
2017-03-25 18:03:05	Yoshi2	there used to be a function called "delete doubles"
2017-03-25 18:03:08	Yoshi2	USED TO BE
2017-03-25 18:03:15	Yoshi2	in like blender 2.5 or whatever
2017-03-25 18:03:31	Yoshi2	I'm in 2.78 and there is NO such function or even a replacement as far as I can tell
2017-03-25 18:10:20	Yoshi2	oh, I actually found it
2017-03-25 18:14:43	@Espyo	lemme guess, got renamed?
2017-03-25 18:16:15	Yoshi2	no, moved into a different menu I think

2017-03-27 18:45:43	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2017-03-27 18:54:15	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-03-27 18:54:16	Testyo	In this documentary we were watching in class I just need to spawn one Lucina
2017-03-27 18:59:48	@Espyo	hi
2017-03-27 19:58:41	Yoshi2	Espyo: "unix principles are a reason a lot of people use linux" true or not?
2017-03-27 19:59:28	@Espyo	hm, you're better off asking J
2017-03-27 19:59:36	@Espyo	the reason I use Linux is because windows isn't functional
2017-03-27 19:59:48	@Espyo	I like a lot of Unix's principles though
2017-03-27 20:02:18	Yoshi2	J: "unix principles are a reason a lot of people use linux" true or not?
2017-03-27 21:22:28	@J	t/f on a question with a vague term like 'a lot' is pretty silly
2017-03-27 21:22:35	@J	but yeah, I see the sentiment around a fair amount
2017-03-27 21:32:40	Yoshi2	another thing the person who said that told me was that Ubuntu should be avoided due to anti unix things like telemetry, systemd and closed sections of code
2017-03-27 21:38:51	@Espyo	true
2017-03-27 21:39:03	@Espyo	but alas, it's pretty much the most user-friendly
2017-03-27 21:39:12	@Espyo	no wonder a lot of people use it as a bridge between the windows world and the Linux world
2017-03-27 21:50:35	Yoshi2	I haven't even been able to find much about telemetry except that it seems to be related to a search bar
2017-03-27 21:50:57	Yoshi2	systemd is not going anywhere in most linux distros
2017-03-27 21:51:15	Yoshi2	and closed code is eh fair enough but ¯\(ツ)/¯  
2017-03-27 22:02:08	@J	I wouldn't say open source is Unix-related
2017-03-27 22:02:18	@J	it's more about how software is designed
2017-03-27 22:02:43	@J	systemd could certainly be designed better, but it's also just really good
2017-03-27 22:04:53	@Espyo	the telemetry thing really is just for the search bar dealy
2017-03-27 22:04:55	@Espyo	and it can be disabled
2017-03-27 22:05:01	@Espyo	so it's a bit of a storm inside a glass cup

2017-03-30 18:57:01	@Espyo	hi
2017-03-30 18:59:36	Yoshi2	I can recognize the address of the BMS reading code almost from the top of my head
2017-03-30 19:00:26	@Espyo	haha
2017-03-30 19:13:45	Yoshi2	8009
2017-03-30 19:13:46	Yoshi2	E240
2017-03-30 19:14:05	@Espyo	well that's not so hard
2017-03-30 19:14:07	@Espyo	you can just meme it up
2017-03-30 19:14:12	@Espyo	 8009 is kinda like 8008
2017-03-30 19:14:14	@Espyo	so, boob
2017-03-30 19:14:19	@Espyo	then you've got 240, which is kinda like 420
2017-03-30 19:41:36	Yoshi2	240blaze it

2017-03-30 22:01:19	Yoshi2	fun fact about the bms reading command
2017-03-30 22:01:52	Yoshi2	if I understood it right, a lot of the reading functions are referenced indirectly
2017-03-30 22:03:19	@Espyo	hm? how come?
2017-03-30 22:10:09	Yoshi2	the code directly handles some opcodes, but others are missing from this bit of assembler code (there are no instructions that check if the opcode is 0xC8 for example)
2017-03-30 22:10:21	Yoshi2	instead it does some trickery with multiplying the opcode by 12
2017-03-30 22:10:34	Yoshi2	then reading 3 values in the ram
2017-03-30 22:10:46	Yoshi2	one of which seems to be a function address that probably parses this damn thing
2017-03-30 22:11:19	@Espyo	multiplying...the opcode

2017-03-30 22:16:44	Testyo	EY? HI
2017-03-30 22:17:38	Yoshi2	I guess there is a table somewhere
2017-03-30 22:17:46	Yoshi2	with 3 x 4 bytes of data per opcode

2017-04-02 17:23:01	Testyo	but she's hooooooot
2017-04-02 17:28:07	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-02 17:34:38	Yoshi2	testyo, who?
2017-04-02 17:34:39	Testyo	Yoshi2.
2017-04-02 17:34:44	Yoshi2	o-o
2017-04-02 17:56:46	@Espyo	is that so...?
2017-04-02 17:56:49	@Espyo	hey miss Yoshi2, you single?
2017-04-02 17:57:18	Yoshi2	uhm..
2017-04-02 17:57:23	Yoshi2	yes..
2017-04-02 17:57:57	@Espyo	Testyo: if Yoshi2 is a "she", why does her voice sound so masculine? and we refer to her as "he"?
2017-04-02 17:57:57	Testyo	OH WAIT
2017-04-02 17:58:00	@Espyo	...
2017-04-02 17:58:04	@Espyo	Testyo, you blew it

2017-04-03 19:36:10	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2017-04-03 19:41:04	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-04-03 19:41:05	Testyo	Tried playing again and when they finally re-released it, it still was bad.
2017-04-03 19:45:00	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-03 20:23:37	Yoshi2	sometimes i'm a bit annoyed by untitled's questions
2017-04-03 20:24:06	Yoshi2	"can bmdview2 open bca files?" well, can it? Go try to open a bca file with bmdview2 and see how it works out for you o-o
2017-04-03 20:24:48	@Espyo	ugh, don't get me started
2017-04-03 20:24:54	@Espyo	Pikmin hacking is still in its infancy
2017-04-03 20:24:59	@Espyo	if it's a text file, we can tamper with it ok
2017-04-03 20:25:04	@Espyo	if not, chances are it's still in early stages
2017-04-03 20:25:13	@Espyo	"can you create Pikmin 3 in Pikmin 2?"
2017-04-03 20:25:15	@Espyo	............
2017-04-03 20:27:13	Yoshi2	also really cute is when he was away for 4 days and then asked if any significant progress was made
2017-04-03 20:28:22	@Espyo	hehehe yeah
2017-04-03 20:28:30	@Espyo	to be fair, we had a week or so where we had a lot of progress
2017-04-03 20:28:34	@Espyo	kinda died out for no real reason
2017-04-03 20:29:33	Yoshi2	and the question about torrents
2017-04-03 20:30:05	Yoshi2	so innocent
2017-04-03 20:30:52	@Espyo	yeah
2017-04-03 21:01:01	Yoshi2	ok fun fact about the bms parser of pikmin
2017-04-03 21:01:46	Yoshi2	unknown opcodes are skipped
2017-04-03 21:04:41	@Espyo	neato
2017-04-03 21:04:43	@Espyo	oh, wait!
2017-04-03 21:04:48	@Espyo	you're talking about BMS parser opcodes
2017-04-03 21:04:53	@Espyo	not machine code opcodes
2017-04-03 21:04:57	@Espyo	oh that makes SO much more sense
2017-04-03 21:05:20	@Espyo	I swear, when you said the game was doing arithmetics with opcodes, my mind nearly collapsed
2017-04-03 21:09:35	Yoshi2	it makes sense from a low level standpoint
2017-04-03 21:10:09	Yoshi2	it has a look-up table for checking if an opcode even exists. If all 3 values it loads from the place are 0 then it doesn't exist
2017-04-03 21:10:13	@Espyo	yeah
2017-04-03 21:10:33	Yoshi2	some opcodes are hardcoded, interestingly enough
2017-04-03 21:10:42	Yoshi2	but the same opcodes still appear in the table
2017-04-03 21:10:44	Yoshi2	so uh, idk
2017-04-03 21:11:24	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 jank *shrug*
2017-04-03 21:11:41	Yoshi2	some opcodes "exist" that I didn't know existed
2017-04-03 21:11:57	Yoshi2	some share the same function address according to the table
2017-04-03 21:12:23	@Espyo	hm, don't see the benefit of that
2017-04-03 21:18:40	Yoshi2	you see
2017-04-03 21:18:51	Yoshi2	if the developers make this as confusing as possible
2017-04-03 21:19:09	Yoshi2	my job becomes much more difficult
2017-04-03 21:21:54	@Espyo	hackers can't read your code if you replace it with spaghetti
2017-04-03 21:24:31	Yoshi2	literally spaghetti if you look at it in terms of assembler
2017-04-03 21:24:47	Yoshi2	it's not even funny
2017-04-03 21:26:13	@Espyo	you've probably seen computer-generated 10000x10000 mazes that are simpler
2017-04-03 21:27:02	Yoshi2	those at least have a solution
2017-04-03 21:27:24	Yoshi2	this assembler doesn't even have deterministic branching
2017-04-03 21:27:31	@Espyo	lol
2017-04-03 21:28:09	Yoshi2	there is a branch to CTR instruction
2017-04-03 21:28:18	Yoshi2	CTR is a register that can be filled with whatever
2017-04-03 21:28:24	Yoshi2	you can branch anywhere if you want
2017-04-03 21:28:31	@Espyo	so, a goto?
2017-04-03 21:29:04	Yoshi2	with goto you have to write down the labels and crap
2017-04-03 21:29:23	Yoshi2	with the btctr instruction you don't need labels
2017-04-03 21:29:35	Yoshi2	fill ctr with an address and off you go on magical adventures
2017-04-03 21:30:30	Yoshi2	the usual branch instructions have fixed addresses
2017-04-03 21:30:53	Yoshi2	e.g. b 0xB00B5 would always jump to 0xB00BS
2017-04-03 21:31:41	Yoshi2	but with btctr you don't know where you will go unless you execute the code till the point where it is executed (or at least the ctr register is written to)
2017-04-03 21:31:57	@Espyo	that can only go well
2017-04-03 21:31:58	@Espyo	good grief
2017-04-03 21:32:11	Yoshi2	it is used in this bms code
2017-04-03 21:32:38	Yoshi2	it uses btctr to jump to function addresses from the table I mention all the time
2017-04-03 21:33:20	@Espyo	ah
2017-04-03 21:33:22	@Espyo	that makes sense
2017-04-03 21:33:26	@Espyo	in high level, that makes MORE sense
2017-04-03 21:33:32	@Espyo	but now that you explain it, it works
2017-04-03 21:35:26	Yoshi2	I've written code to parse the table so I can tell where stuff goes or should go
2017-04-03 21:40:38	Yoshi2	good night

2017-04-04 19:27:55	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-04-04 19:27:55	Testyo	I found it weird when I removed that
2017-04-04 19:28:00	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-04 19:43:28	Yoshi2	my idea of injecting code into where it reads BMS opcodes and then write the opcodes into a free 256 bytes big space as they are read was a success
2017-04-04 19:43:49	@Espyo	niiiiiiiice

2017-04-04 20:09:32	Yoshi2	(copied from ram manually)
2017-04-04 20:11:25	@Espyo	nice alphabet
2017-04-04 20:11:36	Yoshi2	it looks like it is simply counting up but if the value is 0x00 then that opcode hasn't appeared yet
2017-04-04 20:11:53	Yoshi2	which doesn't mean that it will never appear, but the one that aren't 0x00 definitely appeared
2017-04-04 20:13:09	@Espyo	hm
2017-04-04 20:15:26	Yoshi2	what made you go hm?
2017-04-04 20:16:16	@Espyo	just that I get what you mean

2017-04-04 20:28:02	Marty2000	but now that I'm playing Pikmin again...
2017-04-04 20:29:50	Marty2000	Any great discovery in the Pikmin world recently? I haven't really been following...
2017-04-04 20:31:05	Yoshi2	me and pidi figured a small part of pikmin 1's mod files and pidi started work on a .gen editor
2017-04-04 20:31:32	Marty2000	Ah, that's great
2017-04-04 20:33:37	Yoshi2	and I've been poking the bms stuff in pikmin 2 on and off recently
2017-04-04 20:38:27	Yoshi2	and i made a silly cheat code that messes with the way instruments are played in pikmin 2
2017-04-04 20:39:25	Marty2000	Sounds cool. I'd like to see what it looks like
2017-04-04 20:42:04	Yoshi2	haven't made a video of it yet but I'll try to dig the code itself up

2017-04-05 21:17:07	@Espyo	definitely
2017-04-05 21:17:10	@Espyo	plus it's not just that
2017-04-05 21:17:16	@Espyo	but the fact that Doom really does run on a million things
2017-04-05 21:17:37	@Espyo	if you came up to me and told me you got Doom running on your pedometer, I wouldn't doubt you for a second, I really wouldn't
2017-04-05 21:17:46	@Espyo	electric toothbrush, I probably would, since come on now
2017-04-05 21:17:49	@Espyo	but even STILL...
2017-04-05 21:36:07	Yoshi2	running doom is really just a subset of running custom code
2017-04-05 21:49:03	@Espyo	but, however, a good benchmark for complexity and performance

2017-04-08 17:57:49	Yoshi2	returned from my visit to a train museum
2017-04-08 17:57:57	Yoshi2	it was really cool
2017-04-08 17:58:07	Yoshi2	not many people so it was very relaxing
2017-04-08 18:04:32	Yoshi2	espyo, what collection of Pi... are you watching?
2017-04-08 18:05:24	@Espyo	the one with World of Pi in it

2017-04-08 18:51:29	Yoshi2	raaaaarghhh
2017-04-08 18:51:42	Yoshi2	I've started wondering why my code isn't working properly
2017-04-08 18:51:58	Yoshi2	that's because the ppc instructions work on signed values
2017-04-08 18:52:08	@Espyo	ooh
2017-04-08 18:52:52	Yoshi2	now how do I fix that in an easy way....
2017-04-08 18:54:32	Yoshi2	maybe by ANDing the sign bit away

2017-04-08 19:52:49	Yoshi2	I think I made it work
2017-04-08 19:53:15	Yoshi2	my cheat writes 0x0 into addresses at random places
2017-04-08 19:53:23	@Espyo	oooooohh
2017-04-08 19:53:27	@Espyo	what's the TTC?
2017-04-08 19:53:32	@Espyo	I mean, time till crash
2017-04-08 19:53:37	Yoshi2	oh
2017-04-08 19:53:40	@Espyo	it can't be healthy to prod the RAM with zeroes
2017-04-08 19:53:45	Yoshi2	haven't checked
2017-04-08 19:54:02	@Espyo	I'm guessing average of 3 seconds, if you pump one address per frame
2017-04-08 19:54:09	Yoshi2	one thing that happened now is that each time I press a button, a few secs later I get invalid writes
2017-04-08 19:54:19	@Espyo	welp, there you go
2017-04-08 19:54:27	Yoshi2	by code at 0x800a12e4
2017-04-08 19:57:14	Yoshi2	kek at untitled asking how to fix music
2017-04-08 19:58:15	@Espyo	yeah
2017-04-08 19:58:24	Yoshi2	with modding it's freaking great if the game doesn't crash
2017-04-08 19:59:53	@Espyo	yeah
2017-04-08 20:07:12	Testyo	 2social4me of
2017-04-08 20:08:10	@Espyo	k
2017-04-08 20:30:43	Yoshi2	hmm this is interesting, I get invalid reads that don't crash the game
2017-04-08 20:31:42	Yoshi2	0x800aea28 0x80061044 0x80067168 and then the next frame is rendered
2017-04-08 20:32:35	@Espyo	huh
2017-04-08 20:32:42	@Espyo	not sure if it SHOULD always crash or not
2017-04-08 20:42:57	Yoshi2	the fun thing is
2017-04-08 20:43:38	Yoshi2	dolphin warns when invalid reads/writes happen but doesn't crash
2017-04-08 20:43:54	Yoshi2	but if invalid reads/writes keep on happening then that's as good as a crash
2017-04-08 20:44:05	Yoshi2	in this case only 3 invalid reads happen per frame
2017-04-08 20:44:14	Yoshi2	so I can advance the game slowly and still control it
2017-04-08 20:44:21	@Espyo	well, considering sometimes my Dolphin warns of invalid reads or writes when I'm messing around, and then crashes to the point where I can't even kill the process...
2017-04-08 20:44:23	@Espyo	I'd say you're pretty lucky
2017-04-08 20:44:37	@Espyo	sorry, *and then freezes

2017-04-08 20:57:51	Yoshi2	0x8001d544 hmmmm, this thing was called often, maybe some sort of loading code
2017-04-08 20:57:57	Yoshi2	anyway, had something neat just now
2017-04-08 20:58:01	Yoshi2	which I caught on recording lol
2017-04-08 20:58:10	@Espyo	what makes you think it's loading code and not some utility function?

2017-04-09 17:35:06	Yoshi2	I should make the writes 4-byte aligned
2017-04-09 17:35:23	Yoshi2	so if code is overwritten it doesn't become invalid code
2017-04-09 17:35:32	Yoshi2	because 0x000000000000 is a NOP
2017-04-09 17:47:13	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2017-04-09 17:47:14	Yoshi2	also there is an instruction for unsigned division

2017-04-09 17:47:43	Yoshi2	yeah

2017-04-11 19:41:14	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2017-04-11 19:41:14	Testyo	Honestly adele should just do rolling in the code, it's not loose content that nothing points to
2017-04-11 19:43:00	@Espyo	hi
2017-04-11 19:49:57	Yoshi2	I have an idea on what to do to make analyzing bms easier

2017-04-11 19:50:11	Yoshi2	inject assembler that is triggered at specific conditions
2017-04-11 19:51:03	Yoshi2	to emulate a proper debugger
2017-04-11 19:51:50	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2017-04-11 20:25:55	Yoshi2	wow backing up the CR register is a pain
2017-04-11 20:26:21	Yoshi2	move cr into general purpose register, then back up general purpose register to stack
2017-04-11 20:34:22	Yoshi2	hmm actually I think I can get away with not backing up the cr register
2017-04-11 20:34:27	Yoshi2	4 lines of assembler less

2017-04-11 21:01:09	Yoshi2	for a moment I was worried it didn't work
2017-04-11 21:03:03	Yoshi2	looks like it works though, ayyy
2017-04-11 21:03:41	@Espyo	hah
2017-04-11 21:06:34	Yoshi2	and now I'm already too tired for doing anything else
