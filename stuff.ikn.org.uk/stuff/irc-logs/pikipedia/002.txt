2013-12-31 01:52:36	Espyo	if he wreaks havoc here or on #Testyo, ban him
2013-12-31 01:52:43	Espyo	it's obvious he's not on these channels to talk, ever
2013-12-31 01:52:48	Espyo	I doubt he even knows anything about Pikmin
2013-12-31 01:52:51	Espyo	he only exists to spam
2013-12-31 01:52:55	Espyo	so don't be merciful
2013-12-31 01:53:13	Espyo	besides, the bans expire after a bit, so even if IMPOSSIBLY he decided to act good, he'll have the chance to in a few days
2013-12-31 01:53:31	@PikFan	okay

2013-12-31 23:41:18	Espyo	say, Los_Plagas, did you ever get a reply from Lord Raven?
2013-12-31 23:42:13	Los_Plagas	On Twitter?
2013-12-31 23:42:16	Los_Plagas	I'll check.
2013-12-31 23:42:51	Los_Plagas	Unfortunately, no. But I don't think we were expecting much.
2013-12-31 23:43:01	Espyo	right
2013-12-31 23:43:06	Espyo	guess the next step is to try the wiki
2013-12-31 23:43:22	Espyo	or better yet
2013-12-31 23:43:26	Espyo	I'll message him directly on facebook

2013-12-31 23:44:32	Testyo	Hey Los_Plagas, PikFan is here!
2013-12-31 23:44:40	Los_Plagas	Either way, we don't know if he checks them.
2013-12-31 23:45:07	Espyo	true, but it's really our best bet
2013-12-31 23:45:27	@PikFan	hmm?
2013-12-31 23:45:42	Espyo	oh, there's one final trump
2013-12-31 23:45:52	Espyo	I can contact facebook administration directly and tell them I want ownership
2013-12-31 23:45:57	Espyo	hey PikFan
2013-12-31 23:46:01	Los_Plagas	Hi, PikFan.
2013-12-31 23:46:12	@PikFan	hi Espyo, hi Los_Plagas
2013-12-31 23:46:13	Espyo	I was asking Los_Plagas if he got a reply from Lord Raven, to see if I could take over the Pikipedia facebook page
2013-12-31 23:46:23	Los_Plagas	And I assume Facebook's going to hand it to you without asking Lord REVAN permission?
2013-12-31 23:46:28	Espyo	heh
2013-12-31 23:46:31	Espyo	you could assume that
2013-12-31 23:46:42	Espyo	because they would actually help, surprisingly
2013-12-31 23:46:49	@PikFan	hmm
2013-12-31 23:46:57	@PikFan	why not have J take over?
2013-12-31 23:47:10	Espyo	so long as I give enough proof that I'm a user who wants the best for the Pikipedia facebook page, and so long as I can prove Lord Raven is innactive, they'll give me it
2013-12-31 23:47:17	Espyo	because J doesn't use facebook
2013-12-31 23:47:25	Espyo	I mean, as far as I know
2013-12-31 23:47:32	Espyo	hmm
2013-12-31 23:47:35	Los_Plagas	It's not like we could search for him.
2013-12-31 23:47:36	Espyo	let me search
2013-12-31 23:47:36	@PikFan	I see
2013-12-31 23:47:50	Los_Plagas	"Let me search" You know J's last name, too?
2013-12-31 23:48:02	Los_Plagas	And you can figure out who he is by his posts and image?
2013-12-31 23:48:54	Espyo	I know his name
2013-12-31 23:48:59	Espyo	but he doesn't have a facebook account
2013-12-31 23:49:45	Los_Plagas	"I know his name" You couldn't use name alone; it would help to have his last name, too, like I said, but he doesn't, so it really doesn't matter either way;
2013-12-31 23:50:01	Los_Plagas	Also, /why not/ have Espyo take over?
2013-12-31 23:50:19	Espyo	I know his first and last names, I mean
2013-12-31 23:50:20	@PikFan	*shrug*
2013-12-31 23:50:36	@PikFan	I don't know, it just... seems fitting for J to take over
2013-12-31 23:50:56	Espyo	yeah, but I'll have to do
2013-12-31 23:51:01	@PikFan	because he's the head admin of Pikipedia after DLR left
2013-12-31 23:51:09	@PikFan	yeah
2013-12-31 23:51:20	@PikFan	I have no problems with Espyo taking over
2013-12-31 23:51:46	@PikFan	just wanted to see why J wasn't
2013-12-31 23:51:49	Los_Plagas	I dunno if DLR was ever head-admin after Pikipedia got its first few waves of serious users.
2013-12-31 23:51:58	Los_Plagas	Or maybe his edit count just waned in more recent years.
2013-12-31 23:52:16	@PikFan	iirc he created Pikipedia when it was still on wikia
2013-12-31 23:52:21	@PikFan	that was in what, 2005?
2013-12-31 23:52:42	Los_Plagas	He did
2013-12-31 23:52:46	Los_Plagas	That's why he was the founder
2013-12-31 23:52:55	Los_Plagas	Technically he's not the founder of THIS Pikipedia.
2013-12-31 23:52:55	@PikFan	mhm
2013-12-31 23:53:02	Los_Plagas	But he started this whole thing, so . . .
2013-12-31 23:53:11	Los_Plagas	WAIT 
2013-12-31 23:53:14	Los_Plagas	New developments
2013-12-31 23:53:14	@PikFan	?
2013-12-31 23:53:25	Los_Plagas	I may have found Dark Lord Revan's ACTUAL Twitter account
2013-12-31 23:53:33	@PikFan	Espyo, J: 7 minutes
2013-12-31 23:53:36	Los_Plagas	Under his real identity.
2013-12-31 23:53:47	Espyo	yep
2013-12-31 23:54:01	Espyo	oh
2013-12-31 23:54:48	Los_Plagas	And his last post was 9 hours ago
2013-12-31 23:54:53	Los_Plagas	Which is why it's relevant.
2013-12-31 23:55:27	Espyo	right
2013-12-31 23:55:37	Espyo	well, if you can send him a message, that'd be nice
2013-12-31 23:55:41	Espyo	that is, if it's REALLY him
2013-12-31 23:56:56	Los_Plagas	I started off my message with "Are you Dark Lord Revan?"
2013-12-31 23:57:29	Los_Plagas	The exact way I found his page was that he Tweeted with the Pikipedia account, "HINT your favorite admin Dark Lord Revan is (insert possible real-life account here)"
2013-12-31 23:58:06	Los_Plagas	And he reTweeted this account a few times, which sounds like a thing someone with a few different accounts would do.
2013-12-31 23:58:22	Los_Plagas	My god, I hate Twitter's 130 character limit 
2013-12-31 23:58:33	Espyo	ah
2013-12-31 23:58:34	Espyo	heh
2013-12-31 23:58:38	Espyo	ok, gonna go to the living room now

2014-01-01 00:11:56	Los_Plagas	Well, I can too; but I've decided not to drink for a while.

2014-01-01 00:23:34	Espyo	I have to /memorize/ the syntax of some commands
2014-01-01 00:23:42	Espyo	I have to /memorize/ some networking exploit's names
2014-01-01 00:23:43	Espyo	etc.
2014-01-01 00:23:53	Los_Plagas	That sounds horrible
2014-01-01 00:23:58	Espyo	in short, if the students need to memorize something, it's poorly taught
2014-01-01 00:24:07	Los_Plagas	But I just CAN'T WAIT (/sarcasm) until I have to do actual surgery.
2014-01-01 00:24:09	Espyo	if the students have to UNDERSTAND something, it's well taught
2014-01-01 00:24:19	Espyo	that sounds terrifying, though
2014-01-01 00:24:20	Los_Plagas	I'm not sure if I can look at my textbook during a procedure
2014-01-01 00:24:25	Los_Plagas	I'm not going to hope.
2014-01-01 00:24:27	Espyo	right
2014-01-01 00:24:43	Espyo	but on the other hand, in real life, if I want to know the syntax of a command, I do "<command> —help"
2014-01-01 00:24:51	Espyo	same as literally 100% of the people who don't know a command's syntax
2014-01-01 00:24:56	Espyo	yet I'm forced to memorize it for the exam
2014-01-01 00:25:00	Espyo	ffs
2014-01-01 00:25:05	Los_Plagas	Same logic applies to math
2014-01-01 00:25:11	Los_Plagas	CALCULATORS
2014-01-01 00:25:15	Espyo	heh yeah
2014-01-01 00:25:26	Espyo	though to be honest, they teach maths mostly to give us a thinker mindset
2014-01-01 00:25:29	Espyo	but still!...
2014-01-01 00:27:14	Los_Plagas	At least math isn't too hard to memorize. I mean, it's universally understood.
2014-01-01 00:27:25	Los_Plagas	But to someone not experience, programming is just a bunch of gibberish.
2014-01-01 00:33:08	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-01 00:33:36	Espyo	grabbing a random excerpt of code from the depths of the craziness of some library is complicated
2014-01-01 00:33:42	Espyo	but a bit of simple code is easy
2014-01-01 00:33:55	Espyo	to print "Hello" onto the screen, it's literally
2014-01-01 00:33:58	Espyo	printf("Hello");
2014-01-01 00:34:04	Espyo	it's not like
2014-01-01 00:34:15	Los_Plagas	I know some people who I bet wouldn't even know how to start a new paragraph when designing a website.
2014-01-01 00:34:27	Espyo	mov "Hello" &00F98432 [&00B9127B]
2014-01-01 00:34:34	Los_Plagas	How hard is it to type <p> and </p>?!
2014-01-01 00:34:40	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-01 00:34:43	Espyo	I hear ya
2014-01-01 00:34:51	Espyo	as simple as something is, somebody will always find a way to find it complicated
2014-01-01 00:34:55	Los_Plagas	Personally, the bane of my existence with code is the colour codes
2014-01-01 00:35:03	Los_Plagas	I mean, it's easy to look them up
2014-01-01 00:35:22	Los_Plagas	But still, it can be a waste of time when you have to type, say, "light sea-green colour code"
2014-01-01 00:39:25	Los_Plagas	"Somebody will always find a way to make it complicated" That's so true, in so many ways
2014-01-01 00:39:27	Espyo	you mean the typing itself?
2014-01-01 00:39:39	Los_Plagas	Not the typing.
2014-01-01 00:39:52	Los_Plagas	It's just annoying to look them up if you don't know them
2014-01-01 00:39:59	Espyo	oh, the time it takes to look up that #00FFFF is light blue?
2014-01-01 00:40:10	Espyo	I'm pretty good at visualizing them in my head
2014-01-01 00:40:10	Los_Plagas	Yeah
2014-01-01 00:40:16	Espyo	it's just practice
2014-01-01 00:40:29	Los_Plagas	Actually, it's the other way around
2014-01-01 00:40:36	Espyo	and basically, knowing that red + green = yellow, green + blue = light blue and blue + red = purple
2014-01-01 00:40:37	Los_Plagas	I have the colour, but not the code
2014-01-01 00:40:41	Espyo	ah
2014-01-01 00:41:02	Espyo	it's still a matter of mostly knowing what combines to what
2014-01-01 00:41:08	Espyo	oh, also knowing hexadecimal helps
2014-01-01 00:42:21	Los_Plagas	I suppose it would.
2014-01-01 00:42:44	Los_Plagas	I'll probably find time for learning all the codes sometime in my lifetim
2014-01-01 00:43:09	Los_Plagas	But right now, I think I'm really too busy to memorize more than basic code and some MediaWiki for wiki purposes.
2014-01-01 00:49:37	Espyo	right
2014-01-01 01:00:17	Los_Plagas	I might have to go soon; I know it's late for you, so I'll probably talk to you later if you're still on when I get back.
2014-01-01 01:00:59	Espyo	I'm gonna watch a movie
2014-01-01 01:01:05	Espyo	but I might only be back in like 2 hours
2014-01-01 01:01:06	Espyo	so bye
2014-01-01 01:01:10	Los_Plagas	Bye

2014-01-01 17:20:00	Espyo	better than a blue screen
2014-01-01 17:20:06	@J	anyway
2014-01-01 17:20:06	Espyo	because windows cannot into process scheduling
2014-01-01 17:20:16	@J	you remember that game with the green things?
2014-01-01 17:20:17	@J	wait

2014-01-01 17:20:50	Espyo	uh, vaguely
2014-01-01 17:20:54	@J	okay
2014-01-01 17:21:04	@J	meh, I just couldn't think of a name
2014-01-01 17:21:18	@J	I'm going through all my abandoned games and uploading the ones that are vaguely playable
2014-01-01 17:21:21	@J	so they should probably have names
2014-01-01 17:21:23	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-01 17:21:25	Espyo	right
2014-01-01 17:21:57	Espyo	speaking of which, I still need to upload my live stream intermission thingie
2014-01-01 17:22:12	@J	your what?
2014-01-01 17:22:14	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/1.mp4
2014-01-01 17:23:29	Espyo	you ended it before completing it
2014-01-01 17:23:32	Espyo	boo
2014-01-01 17:23:42	Espyo	anyway, I made a program that's meant to be used for streamers
2014-01-01 17:24:00	Espyo	when they need to go away because nature calls, or because a truck crashed against their side wall and they need to go check it out
2014-01-01 17:24:09	Espyo	before leaving the stream just like that, they start this program
2014-01-01 17:24:23	Espyo	that just displays a scrolling message saying "I'll be right back", as well as an optional reason
2014-01-01 17:24:29	@J	hmm, I vaguely remember that
2014-01-01 17:24:32	@J	maybe
2014-01-01 17:24:32	Espyo	but to keep viewers entertained, it has more than just the message
2014-01-01 17:24:49	Espyo	smoothly changing background color, for one
2014-01-01 17:24:59	Espyo	and above that, the background has shooting stars, rain, and other neat effects
2014-01-01 17:25:04	Espyo	I don't think I ever brought it up though
2014-01-01 17:25:16	Espyo	I did now because "add that program to souceforge or something" is on my ToDo list for the past 4 months
2014-01-01 17:25:20	Espyo	...and it's task #1
2014-01-01 17:25:28	Espyo	with time, I tend to ignore the first 3 tasks
2014-01-01 17:25:42	Espyo	because I always consider them "stuff I can only do when I have internet connection AND free time AND ..."
2014-01-01 17:28:47	@J	maybe I mixed it up with something else, then
2014-01-01 17:45:47	Espyo	the Pikmin 2 game files are so weird sometimes
2014-01-01 17:46:03	Espyo	"11" eggs could either mean 1 egg, or literally 11
2014-01-01 17:58:36	@J	back later
2014-01-01 17:58:58	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-01 18:56:17	@J	back
2014-01-01 18:57:26	Espyo	ok, it's even worse than I thought
2014-01-01 18:57:29	Espyo	"11" eggs means 2
2014-01-01 18:57:57	@J	yeah, I remember this stuff
2014-01-01 18:58:04	@J	I thought we worked it out, but I don't remember
2014-01-01 18:59:52	Espyo	drat
2014-01-01 19:00:09	Espyo	digit 1 + digit 2 works, sometimes
2014-01-01 19:00:17	Espyo	 20, 30, 40, etc. is always 2, 3, 4 etc.
2014-01-01 19:00:23	Espyo	 11 apparently is 2
2014-01-01 19:00:26	Espyo	but sometimes 10 really is 10
2014-01-01 19:04:55	@J	it must depend on something else as well, then
2014-01-01 19:05:06	@J	some flag that tells it whether it's a 2-digit number
2014-01-01 19:05:31	Espyo	ElecBug 40 	# weight

2014-01-01 19:29:33	Los_Plagas	I have no idea how
2014-01-01 19:29:51	Los_Plagas	But Revan somehow interpreted that /I/ wanted to be admin on the Facebook thing.
2014-01-01 19:30:18	Los_Plagas	And he /somehow/ managed to track down my Facebook account (never once told him my Facebook) and made ME admin
2014-01-01 19:30:42	Los_Plagas	So, do you want me to make you an admin, too?

2014-01-01 19:35:20	Espyo	well, yeah
2014-01-01 19:35:27	Espyo	did he reply back?
2014-01-01 19:35:30	Espyo	or did he just /do/ it?
2014-01-01 19:35:52	Los_Plagas	Yes, he replied back
2014-01-01 19:36:12	Los_Plagas	He told me that he would make me an admin. And never once mentioned you
2014-01-01 19:36:15	Espyo	did he ever say anything noteworthy, or did he just go 'k?
2014-01-01 19:36:23	Espyo	nuts
2014-01-01 19:36:33	Espyo	maybe you should message him again just to make sure he understoods what we want
2014-01-01 19:36:43	Espyo	so that he suddenly doesn't see me as an admin and starts thinking something's up
2014-01-01 19:36:45	Espyo	and goes berserk
2014-01-01 19:37:31	Los_Plagas	His exact message was,  "I added you to the admins on the facebook page"
2014-01-01 19:37:34	Los_Plagas	That's literally it
2014-01-01 19:37:47	Espyo	eesh
2014-01-01 19:40:17	@J	fun
2014-01-01 19:42:12	Los_Plagas	So anyway, I found your Facebook, Espyo, and using my limited knowledge of the site I will attempt to make you an admin
2014-01-01 19:42:25	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-01 19:42:58	Espyo	J: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Water%20ripple.png this is the water ripple effect used in P1 and P2
2014-01-01 19:43:08	Espyo	I cannot for the life of me understand how they animate this
2014-01-01 19:44:31	@J	hmm
2014-01-01 19:45:03	@J	is it possible they cycle the brightness?
2014-01-01 19:45:14	Espyo	might be that
2014-01-01 19:45:22	@J	is that the exact image, or was it converted/
2014-01-01 19:45:22	@J	*?
2014-01-01 19:45:30	Espyo	also I simply cannot believe that searching "water ripple texture" on Google Image Search yields absolutely no relevant results
2014-01-01 19:45:35	Espyo	ripped from Dolphin
2014-01-01 19:45:47	Espyo	hm, good thinking, I'll check P2's actual files
2014-01-01 19:45:49	Espyo	if I can find it
2014-01-01 19:45:53	@J	where is it?
2014-01-01 19:45:54	@J	oh
2014-01-01 19:45:55	@J	I see
2014-01-01 19:45:56	@J	okay
2014-01-01 19:47:45	@J	/user/Kando/mizu.bti is weirdly small
2014-01-01 19:47:50	@J	and I think it means water
2014-01-01 19:49:59	Espyo	I was just browsing Kando when you said that
2014-01-01 19:50:29	Espyo	it's a 2x2 texture
2014-01-01 19:50:40	Espyo	either btidump can't dump it right (likely), or it's a bunch of nothing
2014-01-01 19:55:52	Los_Plagas	Ugh, seems I can't make Espyo an admin for the page because Revan didn't give me enough power; Espyo, do you want me to ask him again and make it clear that I want you to be admin, too, or should I just post on my own?
2014-01-01 19:58:01	Espyo	well, if you're up to posting updates kinda regularly, and find users, maybe you can do it
2014-01-01 19:58:44	Espyo	 /user/Kando/map/waterbox.szs has more than one texture
2014-01-01 19:58:50	Espyo	but the other doesn't make much more sense
2014-01-01 20:00:23	Espyo	...and it has an animation BMDview2 can't visualize
2014-01-01 20:10:46	@J	okay, game engine question
2014-01-01 20:10:53	Espyo	mhm?
2014-01-01 20:11:04	@J	graphics have an 'anchor' which determines the part that stays in the same place if the size changes
2014-01-01 20:11:14	@J	whether through scaling, changing the image, whatever
2014-01-01 20:11:30	@J	and also a 'rot_anchor' that does the same for rotation
2014-01-01 20:11:58	@J	now, flipping the image also needs an anchor, but should it have a separate one like rotation, or use the same one scaling, etc. uses
2014-01-01 20:12:01	@J	?
2014-01-01 20:12:28	@J	or could it use the rotation anchor, even, since it's more like rotation than other transforms?

2014-01-01 20:14:17	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-01 20:14:26	Espyo	a flip is actually a scale, really
2014-01-01 20:14:39	Espyo	but why isn't the anchor shared for rotation as well?
2014-01-01 20:16:13	@J	I just feel like you might want them to be different
2014-01-01 20:16:27	Espyo	in that case, the flip one should be different too
2014-01-01 20:16:47	Espyo	one for flipping, one for rotation, and one for the rest
2014-01-01 20:16:56	Espyo	though the best way would be to have one for all, really
2014-01-01 20:17:03	@J	hmm
2014-01-01 20:17:14	Espyo	for consistency's sake, more than anything
2014-01-01 20:17:37	@J	but then what if you want them to be different?  You'd have to manually keep track of everything
2014-01-01 20:18:05	@J	I suppose the rotation (and flip) one(s) could be the same as the scaling one until they're changed explicity
2014-01-01 20:18:08	@J	*ly
2014-01-01 20:18:08	Espyo	huh? is it just me, or that question doesn't fit what you say immediately after?
2014-01-01 20:18:47	@J	if you want different rotation and scaling anchors but they're implemented as the same one, you have to manually move the graphic after every rotation
2014-01-01 20:19:12	Espyo	oh
2014-01-01 20:19:12	Espyo	drat
2014-01-01 20:19:18	Espyo	I made myself be misunderstood
2014-01-01 20:19:23	Espyo	 20:17	Espyo	though the best way would be to have one for all, really
2014-01-01 20:19:29	Espyo	by this, I meant a DIFFERENT one for each
2014-01-01 20:19:34	@J	OH
2014-01-01 20:19:37	@J	okay, that makes sense
2014-01-01 20:20:16	@J	okay, that makes the 'consistency' remark make sense too
2014-01-01 20:20:20	@J	I'll do that, then
2014-01-01 20:20:32	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-01 20:20:42	Espyo	nuts, of course you misunderstood
2014-01-01 20:20:44	Espyo	I would either heh

2014-01-02 02:11:27	Espyo	hey
2014-01-02 02:11:59	@PikFan	so I've been trying to beat my 35-second record for beating the Armored Mawdad in Mission Mode
2014-01-02 02:12:12	@PikFan	it's... not fun, to say the least
2014-01-02 02:13:42	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-02 02:15:02	@PikFan	so I read the topic about screenshots
2014-01-02 02:15:15	@PikFan	Toomai's information will be pretty helpful
2014-01-02 02:16:56	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-02 02:17:19	Espyo	but that only applies to the koppad camera shots, right
2014-01-02 02:17:20	Espyo	*?
2014-01-02 02:17:25	Espyo	or can you take Wii U screenshots at any time?
2014-01-02 02:17:34	@PikFan	I inferred the latter
2014-01-02 02:17:38	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-02 02:17:47	Espyo	well, should have a "screenshot" button on the pad somewhere
2014-01-02 02:18:20	@PikFan	well, on the GamePad, when playing P3, there /is/ an ability to take photos via the KopPad
2014-01-02 02:18:36	@PikFan	...but upon taking the photo it forces you to post it on Miiverse
2014-01-02 02:18:47	@PikFan	which I find dumb
2014-01-02 02:21:24	Espyo	he
2014-01-02 02:21:26	Espyo	*h
2014-01-02 02:30:23	@PikFan	ah, so it DOES work
2014-01-02 02:30:43	@PikFan	I've got the TV screen and the GamePad screen
2014-01-02 02:31:13	@PikFan	and it's asking me which screen I want to upload
2014-01-02 02:33:11	Espyo	yay
2014-01-02 02:37:02	@PikFan	um... http://www.pikminwiki.com/Armored_Mawdad#Strategy
2014-01-02 02:37:07	@PikFan	that's a bit long
2014-01-02 02:37:21	@PikFan	it's /longer/ than what wikia has
2014-01-02 02:37:51	Espyo	hah
2014-01-02 02:38:34	@PikFan	I see several errors with it though
2014-01-02 02:39:05	@PikFan	"Pikmin" in some cases are not capitals, and the strategy guide is first-person
2014-01-02 02:40:53	@PikFan	also you know what's funny about this enemy?
2014-01-02 02:40:54	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Arctic_Cannon_Larva
2014-01-02 02:41:11	@PikFan	over at Fanon, there was an enemy called the Tundra Cannon Beetle
2014-01-02 02:41:18	@PikFan	and it too shot out snowballs
2014-01-02 02:41:24	Espyo	right
2014-01-02 02:41:30	Espyo	hehehe
2014-01-02 02:41:49	@PikFan	maybe Nintendo did take a look at Fanon... o_o
2014-01-02 02:44:55	@PikFan	oh, I remembered something
2014-01-02 02:45:18	@PikFan	you added that 2-Player Battle locations parameter to the infobox enemy, right?
2014-01-02 02:45:51	@PikFan	well, I'll go ahead and start changing the infoboxes
2014-01-02 02:45:56	Espyo	mhm

2014-01-02 12:29:32	Espyo	that's the most I can go without spoilers

2014-01-02 12:30:13	@PikFan	the Pink Onion one
2014-01-02 12:30:28	Miles	Yeah, there's literally no reason to build that bridge
2014-01-02 12:30:44	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-02 12:30:50	@PikFan	then how do you get out of it
2014-01-02 12:31:08	Miles	Lilypads
2014-01-02 12:31:11	@PikFan	isn't there a boundary where the bridge should be
2014-01-02 12:31:19	@PikFan	ah, right
2014-01-02 12:33:34	@PikFan	I saw a video of the Scornet Maestro bridge skip

2014-01-02 12:36:14	@PikFan	10 day or speedrun

2014-01-02 12:58:15	Miles	The getting hurt thing was added in the newest patch
2014-01-02 12:58:26	@PikFan	oh :|
2014-01-02 12:58:26	Miles	Since one of the DLC stages has bottomless pits

2014-01-02 13:22:23	Miles	I do that way too often
2014-01-02 13:22:46	Espyo	ah Miles, you have to think within the spirit of the metaphysical properties of what might actually be the truth about a trailer
2014-01-02 13:22:49	Espyo	or something
2014-01-02 13:23:23	@PikFan	...I didn
2014-01-02 13:23:32	@PikFan	didn't understand a word you just said
2014-01-02 13:23:40	@PikFan	sounds very philosophical

2014-01-02 19:13:15	@J	okay, so that was pretty scary
2014-01-02 19:13:25	@J	I booted, and I didn't have any audio
2014-01-02 19:13:39	@J	then I realise the graphics were going a bit crazy, as if I had no hardware acceleration
2014-01-02 19:13:44	@J	*realised
2014-01-02 19:13:46	Espyo	that sounds like a thing that happens sometimes, actually
2014-01-02 19:13:49	@J	then I realised there was no networking
2014-01-02 19:14:17	@J	so I tried to find out why, and the service manager wouldn't let me unless I was root
2014-01-02 19:14:22	Espyo	ah yes, when I had to use Ubuntu because windows didn't boot, some months ago, 1/4 or so boots didn't have audio
2014-01-02 19:14:41	@J	I discovered some reference to polkit calls failing, which is a permissions thing
2014-01-02 19:14:51	@J	so I rebooted, and everything is fine
2014-01-02 19:15:03	@J	...I'm just going to blame it on the harddrive, like everything else
2014-01-02 19:15:08	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-02 19:15:13	Espyo	it's the best bet anyway
2014-01-02 19:18:10	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Shower_Room#Sublevel_7_.28Final_Floor.29 ok, see how there's only one cave unit for this sublevel, and its cell on the table is all stretched?
2014-01-02 19:18:18	Espyo	any suggestions on how to make it square?
2014-01-02 19:18:29	Espyo	if 3+ cells occupy a line, they're all the same size
2014-01-02 19:19:00	Espyo	but a single one takes the width of the "Internal cave name" cell
2014-01-02 19:23:24	@J	I don't see any stretched cells
2014-01-02 19:23:40	@J	there are 9 units
2014-01-02 19:24:00	@J	ah, you meant sublevel 4
2014-01-02 19:24:54	Espyo	 7
2014-01-02 19:24:56	Espyo	the one I linked to
2014-01-02 19:24:59	Espyo	though 4 works too
2014-01-02 19:27:18	Espyo	some more info: the infobox has 6 columns
2014-01-02 19:27:34	Espyo	the "Internal cave name" cell has a colspan of 3, and so does the "yakushima_3" cell
2014-01-02 19:27:51	Espyo	so if there are 6 units in a line, they all have their own width, everything works fine
2014-01-02 19:28:01	@J	the row needs another cell
2014-01-02 19:28:13	@J	7 has 9 cells
2014-01-02 19:28:39	Espyo	wait, what am I talking about
2014-01-02 19:28:42	Espyo	sublevel 7 is fine
2014-01-02 19:28:42	Espyo	ugh
2014-01-02 19:28:47	Espyo	just sublevel 4, then
2014-01-02 19:38:41	@J	you worked it out?
2014-01-02 19:39:41	Espyo	no no
2014-01-02 19:40:02	@J	[19:28:01] @J the row needs another cell
2014-01-02 19:40:11	@J	I don't know why, but just add an empty cell
2014-01-02 19:40:12	Espyo	well, 5 cells, actually
2014-01-02 19:40:13	@J	with colspan=5
2014-01-02 19:40:18	Espyo	oh, or that
2014-01-02 19:40:34	Espyo	problem: how to do that
2014-01-02 19:40:53	Espyo	Testyo: memo PikFan fun exercise: count how many things are incorrect in this http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Submerged_Castle
2014-01-02 19:40:53	Testyo	Done, I saved a memo for PikFan saying: fun exercise: count how many things are incorrect in this http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Submerged_Castle.
2014-01-02 19:41:03	Espyo	>If an external cheat is used to make all Pikmin types immune to drowning and the player tries to enter the Submerged Castle with them, the game will outright deny the player from entering, stating that only Blue Pikmin may enter.
2014-01-02 19:41:09	Espyo	Miles can confirm that that's ^ bull
2014-01-02 19:41:25	@J	no, that's true
2014-01-02 19:41:30	Espyo	I'm sure someone's inside Pikmin wikia adding false information
2014-01-02 19:41:36	Espyo	most of it is
2014-01-02 19:41:41	Espyo	I should've quoted better
2014-01-02 19:41:46	Espyo	I mean the part where it states only blues may enter
2014-01-02 19:41:49	@J	it's true
2014-01-02 19:41:55	Espyo	it states something different
2014-01-02 19:42:02	Espyo	but it doesn't have a specific message saying only blues can enter
2014-01-02 19:42:12	Espyo	hmm, there was a video, wasn't there?
2014-01-02 19:42:26	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o61v2-pWno
2014-01-02 19:42:39	Espyo	oh, it was actually you who uploaded it
2014-01-02 19:42:45	@J	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o61v2-pWno
2014-01-02 19:42:46	@J	yep
2014-01-02 19:42:49	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-02 19:42:54	Espyo	says it's dangerous to go down without Pikmin
2014-01-02 19:42:58	Espyo	doesn't say only blues can go
2014-01-02 19:43:03	@J	oh, I see what you're saying
2014-01-02 19:43:15	Espyo	the game considers the player has having no Pikmin, it doesn't tell them that blues are the only ones who can go
2014-01-02 19:43:18	@J	yeah, I guess that makes it wrong
2014-01-02 19:43:37	@J	but you could say that they're the same thing
2014-01-02 19:43:42	@J	I wouldn't really call it misleading
2014-01-02 19:44:29	Espyo	it's still wrong
2014-01-02 19:44:41	Espyo	and just proves the lack of attention to accuracy we keep worrying about
2014-01-02 19:44:43	@J	mm, but it's not really important
2014-01-02 19:44:49	Espyo	it's not
2014-01-02 19:44:56	Espyo	but it's not as exact as it should be
2014-01-02 19:45:03	Espyo	and it's not like an easy saying to say wrong
2014-01-02 19:45:24	Espyo	>The Submerged Castle was originally going to be called "The Submarine Castle."
2014-01-02 19:45:34	@J	never heard that
2014-01-02 19:45:36	Espyo	period inside the quote ASIDE... I don't know if that's true
2014-01-02 19:45:45	Espyo	it's possible that that's the Japanese name
2014-01-02 19:45:49	Espyo	in which case, no, it's wrong
2014-01-02 19:46:01	Espyo	other than that, unseen64, TCRF, and other places don't state anything of the sort
2014-01-02 19:46:43	Espyo	http://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2/Early_English_Script
2014-01-02 19:46:43	Espyo	oh
2014-01-02 19:46:46	Espyo	it's actually right
2014-01-02 19:46:55	Espyo	BUT, because they always have to get something wrong, the period is inside the quote
2014-01-02 19:54:11	Espyo	...oh
2014-01-02 19:54:31	Espyo	the Waterwraith actually contains the Professional Noisemaker on all sublevels
2014-01-02 19:57:29	@J	mm, I don't see why he wouldn'h
2014-01-02 19:57:31	@J	*t
2014-01-02 19:58:55	Espyo	from my understanding, you just add an underscore and the name of a treasure, and boom, the enemy has that treasure in them
2014-01-02 19:59:05	Espyo	so they could've just as easily make it not have it
2014-01-02 19:59:10	Espyo	maybe
2014-01-02 19:59:30	Espyo	but I doubt they programmed an Orange Bulborb enemy, an "Orange Bulborb carrying the (...)" enemy, etc.
2014-01-02 19:59:37	Espyo	(can't remember any treasure)
2014-01-02 19:59:57	Espyo	still, I think it's worth a small mention, mostly for the readers who aren't familiar as to how these kind of things work internally
2014-01-02 20:00:18	Espyo	so it's just enough to say it's programmed to drop it regardless of sublevel, despite the fact that you can never kill it outside of 5
2014-01-02 20:09:46	@J	oh, yeah, I remember that
2014-01-02 20:11:38	Los_Plagas	I just started doing the "fun excercise
2014-01-02 20:11:48	Espyo	Los_Plagas: hey
2014-01-02 20:11:50	Espyo	when did you join?
2014-01-02 20:11:55	Los_Plagas	I dunno if you meant factual errors or errors in general, but I've found 1 already
2014-01-02 20:11:57	Espyo	oh, I see
2014-01-02 20:12:04	Espyo	errors in general
2014-01-02 20:12:10	Espyo	errors and flaws
2014-01-02 20:12:11	@J	[18:13:24] --> Los_Plagas (Mibbit@wiwn-umbipe8.dsl.mindspring.com) has joined #pikipedia
2014-01-02 20:12:13	Espyo	and poorness
2014-01-02 20:12:17	Espyo	yeah, I see now
2014-01-02 20:12:25	Espyo	they still use the generic cave image on the infobox
2014-01-02 20:12:34	Los_Plagas	Anyway
2014-01-02 20:12:40	Los_Plagas	Mistake 1
2014-01-02 20:12:54	Los_Plagas	The Waterwraith (the boss of this cave) appears on every level, making it crucial that Olimar and Louie completes the cave's sublevels quickly.
2014-01-02 20:13:13	Los_Plagas	Note that it says "Olimar and Louie COMPLETES"
2014-01-02 20:13:16	Los_Plagas	Should be complete
2014-01-02 20:13:33	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-02 20:13:46	Espyo	I don't know if we have that text, but we have something similar
2014-01-02 20:13:51	Espyo	I'm working on that article right now, you see
2014-01-02 20:13:52	Espyo	(ours, of course)
2014-01-02 20:13:59	Espyo	either way, I rewrote that section a bit
2014-01-02 20:14:18	Los_Plagas	Also, if our article says something about the Waterwraith only spawning on the last level if you go into the arena, that's kinda wrong
2014-01-02 20:14:31	Espyo	no, we say the player
2014-01-02 20:14:37	Los_Plagas	I believe the Waterwraith will eventually just drop into the arena regardless if you wait.
2014-01-02 20:14:41	Espyo	ah, yes, it is wrong, I think
2014-01-02 20:14:49	Espyo	I'll check the game files
2014-01-02 20:14:54	Los_Plagas	Yes, we say the player, of course
2014-01-02 20:14:58	Espyo	{f016} 4 15.000000 	# BlackManTimer
2014-01-02 20:15:02	Espyo	spawns after 15 seconds
2014-01-02 20:15:05	Espyo	...or what I presume to be seconds
2014-01-02 20:15:06	Los_Plagas	But it's just info waiting for you to tidy up
2014-01-02 20:15:10	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-02 20:15:21	Los_Plagas	Of course, you wouldn't say something like "kinda wrong" on an encyclopaedia article
2014-01-02 20:15:24	Espyo	though I'm only really expanding the enemy/plant/etc. list on each sublevel, and adding technical info
2014-01-02 20:15:28	Los_Plagas	I think it might actually be minutes, though.
2014-01-02 20:15:32	Los_Plagas	If it doesn't say.
2014-01-02 20:15:37	Espyo	not really focusing on the main paragraphs, unless I spot something specifically
2014-01-02 20:15:41	Espyo	it can't be minutes
2014-01-02 20:15:47	Espyo	'cause sublevel 1 has that set to 300
2014-01-02 20:15:55	Espyo	must be seconds; 5 minutes for sublevel 1 seems accurate
2014-01-02 20:16:00	Los_Plagas	Oh, so it has to be seconds.
2014-01-02 20:16:28	Espyo	yeah, though it could also be Weird Pikmin 2 Time Units™
2014-01-02 20:16:36	Espyo	the challenge mode levels use those
2014-01-02 20:16:39	Los_Plagas	Strange - I thought it would take more . . . but I don't take it upon myself to play the Waterwraith frequently, so I would trust data more than myself.
2014-01-02 20:16:58	Espyo	I put a ToDo to confirm the "5 minutes" later
2014-01-02 20:17:02	Los_Plagas	Is there any way to describe those units?
2014-01-02 20:17:12	Espyo	for now, I'm just focusing on passing the data from the game files onto the wiki
2014-01-02 20:17:16	Espyo	yeah, a "non second"
2014-01-02 20:17:18	Espyo	I really don't know
2014-01-02 20:17:21	Espyo	I just call them time units
2014-01-02 20:17:32	Espyo	it's more than a second, I believe
2014-01-02 20:17:35	Los_Plagas	. . . the hell?
2014-01-02 20:17:47	Los_Plagas	The wikia article has weird music titles for the sound tracks
2014-01-02 20:17:55	Espyo	those are the uh...
2014-01-02 20:17:59	Espyo	commonly accepted... titles?
2014-01-02 20:18:05	Espyo	it's the titles you see in all OSTs, at least
2014-01-02 20:18:12	Espyo	all music rips, rather
2014-01-02 20:18:20	Espyo	but I'm not sure if there's an official word on those titles
2014-01-02 20:18:22	Los_Plagas	At the very least, I would change the last one
2014-01-02 20:18:32	Los_Plagas	I wouldn't want an adjective like "pathetic" in there
2014-01-02 20:18:34	Espyo	heh, but that is the title that everybody recognizes
2014-01-02 20:18:50	Espyo	just plop that title into google or youtube and you'll get tons of results
2014-01-02 20:18:58	Espyo	anyway, I'm not much of a fan of having a section just for the list of songs
2014-01-02 20:19:05	Los_Plagas	Also, if there's any gender pronouns in the article, lose them.
2014-01-02 20:19:14	Espyo	not to mention it makes more sense to have each sublevel's song on the sublevel section of each article
2014-01-02 20:19:16	Los_Plagas	The Wikia articles uses "he" a few times to describe the Waterwraith
2014-01-02 20:19:20	Espyo	(already added that to the todo)
2014-01-02 20:19:26	Espyo	it does
2014-01-02 20:19:41	Espyo	well, I know I don't, and I don't really have to pay attention to it
2014-01-02 20:19:54	Espyo	I just write "it" naturally when referring to P2 creatures
2014-01-02 20:19:57	Espyo	in fact, I think we have a task on that
2014-01-02 20:20:04	Espyo	hm, it's weird, because in Portugal, we have no "it"
2014-01-02 20:20:13	Espyo	when we want to refer to something genderless, we just use "he"
2014-01-02 20:20:17	Espyo	so you'd think I use "he" right off the bat
2014-01-02 20:20:22	Espyo	and I actually do, if I'm in a hurry
2014-01-02 20:20:36	Espyo	but on these articles, I actually use "it" from the get-go
2014-01-02 20:21:02	Los_Plagas	"He" is usually the default for things you don't know the gender of
2014-01-02 20:21:25	Los_Plagas	Like, say Nights from that SEGA video game series is typically called he, even though "it" has an obviously feminine voice
2014-01-02 20:21:56	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-02 20:22:11	Espyo	canonically, it's meant to be neutral, so both boys and girls can identify with it
2014-01-02 20:22:27	Espyo	funny thing, I was going to play some NiGHTS before the new year
2014-01-02 20:22:39	Espyo	...except Steam doesn't save the save files
2014-01-02 20:22:46	Espyo	so I pretty much had to restart everything
2014-01-02 20:22:49	Espyo	there goes my progress
2014-01-02 20:22:49	Los_Plagas	Hmm
2014-01-02 20:22:52	Los_Plagas	Which game?
2014-01-02 20:22:53	Espyo	still a fun game, though
2014-01-02 20:22:55	Los_Plagas	First or second?
2014-01-02 20:23:01	Espyo	the one on Steam; a remake of the first
2014-01-02 20:23:20	Los_Plagas	I would hate for that to happen with the second gam
2014-01-02 20:23:26	Los_Plagas	Stupid Bomamba and her cats
2014-01-02 20:23:37	Los_Plagas	(She's a witch-thing boss)
2014-01-02 20:23:38	Miles	Oh no, it must be so hard to get your progress in NiGHTS back
2014-01-02 20:23:58	Los_Plagas	sarcasm?
2014-01-02 20:24:02	Miles	Yes
2014-01-02 20:24:12	Espyo	it's not, but I'm busy
2014-01-02 20:24:15	-->	BetaMaster (BetaMaster@c-521-44-23-901.hsd6.pa.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2014-01-02 20:24:21	Espyo	hey, not like I'm complaining
2014-01-02 20:24:29	Espyo	any excuse I can get to play more NiGHTS is fine by me
2014-01-02 20:24:38	Espyo	but I did lose my high scores, that kinda sucked
2014-01-02 20:25:11	Miles	Don't really like the Steam "port" anyway
2014-01-02 20:25:22	Miles	Considering it's not a port, it's a recreation
2014-01-02 20:25:43	Miles	...Well, it IS a port, of the PS2 version, which was a recreation of the Saturn version, but anyway
2014-01-02 20:25:51	Espyo	heh
2014-01-02 20:25:52	Los_Plagas	Was the Submerged Castle called the "Submarine Castle" in beta?
2014-01-02 20:26:00	Espyo	meh, it has leaderboards and such, better than just a completely lazy port
2014-01-02 20:26:02	Los_Plagas	According to the wikia version, it is.
2014-01-02 20:26:05	Espyo	Los_Plagas: it actually was
2014-01-02 20:26:09	Espyo	doesn't seem like it, but it was
2014-01-02 20:26:16	Espyo	http://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2/Early_English_Script
2014-01-02 20:26:22	Espyo	dinner now
2014-01-02 20:26:23	Los_Plagas	Hmm - do we have it in our article?
2014-01-02 20:26:55	Miles	But it basically feels like "Here's the assets and a copy of NiGHTS you can play, now go recreate it"
2014-01-02 20:27:17	Miles	So a TON of differences
2014-01-02 20:27:25	Miles	Since they might as well be different games
2014-01-02 21:07:58	Espyo	Los_Plagas: I'm adding it on my revision
2014-01-02 21:08:23	Espyo	Miles: I played the original on my uncle's house several years ago, I can't remember how close this is to the original or not
2014-01-02 21:08:31	Espyo	so the Steam version has new stages, new physics, ...?
2014-01-02 21:11:13	Los_Plagas	New stages?
2014-01-02 21:11:27	Espyo	yeah, compared to the original NiGHTS
2014-01-02 21:11:31	Los_Plagas	If it just supposed to be considered a "remake," than they usually wouldn't add on something that major.
2014-01-02 21:12:01	Miles	No, not new stages
2014-01-02 21:12:12	Miles	Entirely different physics, entirely different AI behavior, etc.
2014-01-02 21:13:09	Los_Plagas	That, I can understand.
2014-01-02 21:13:27	Espyo	ah
2014-01-02 21:13:47	Espyo	I'm guessing the trick cancel trick (what) wasn't present in the original
2014-01-02 21:13:57	Espyo	you know, the trick where you bump into ceilings and floors to cancel a trick
2014-01-02 21:14:03	Miles	Um, it was
2014-01-02 21:14:11	Espyo	oh? and they didn't fix it?
2014-01-02 21:14:18	Miles	There's no "fixing" it
2014-01-02 21:14:34	Miles	Fixing it would mean they were using the same code
2014-01-02 21:14:37	Miles	Which they're not
2014-01-02 21:14:49	Miles	That means they somehow made the same mistake again
2014-01-02 21:14:57	Espyo	well, ok, let me rephra— yeah, exactly
2014-01-02 21:15:05	Espyo	is it even the same team?
2014-01-02 21:15:10	Espyo	Sonic Team changed a lot over time
2014-01-02 21:15:13	Miles	I doubt it
2014-01-02 21:23:10	Los_Plagas	I suppose "different team" could mean some different stuff
2014-01-02 21:23:23	Los_Plagas	It could imply that the remake was made by an ENTIRELY different dev team
2014-01-02 21:23:40	Los_Plagas	Or it could imply it's still Sonic Team, but that it has different team members, people left, etc
2014-01-02 21:23:48	Espyo	the latter
2014-01-02 21:23:52	Miles	It most likely was, but even if it was the same people
2014-01-02 21:24:00	Miles	"Recreate this game you made 10 years ago"
2014-01-02 21:24:11	Los_Plagas	And port it to another console
2014-01-02 21:24:34	Los_Plagas	(I think; not too good with Steam, so I don't know if that's how it worked)
2014-01-02 21:25:28	Miles	Wait, it was released in 2008?
2014-01-02 21:25:37	Miles	I thought it was long before that
2014-01-02 21:25:39	Miles	12 years then
2014-01-02 21:25:54	Los_Plagas	I thought 10 years was a bit of hyperbole, either way
2014-01-02 21:26:19	Los_Plagas	I mean, there ARE a few great games from back then, but with a game as high-quality as NiGHTS, well . . . .
2014-01-02 21:27:16	Miles	Ugh
2014-01-02 21:27:25	Miles	I'm leaving in 40 hours and am nowhere near ready
2014-01-02 21:27:31	Miles	Why do I procrastinate so much
2014-01-02 21:28:10	Espyo	leaving for AGDQ?
2014-01-02 21:29:27	Los_Plagas	Speedrunners are so lucky
2014-01-02 21:29:50	Miles	Yes
2014-01-02 21:29:54	Miles	Not sure why I'm lucky
2014-01-02 21:30:01	Los_Plagas	Because you can do games fast
2014-01-02 21:30:07	Los_Plagas	I do games slllllllllloooooooowwwwwwwwwww
2014-01-02 21:30:31	Miles	Have you tried to do a game fast?
2014-01-02 21:30:41	Los_Plagas	Yes
2014-01-02 21:30:47	Los_Plagas	And I can occasionally do it
2014-01-02 21:30:55	Los_Plagas	But not nearly as well as I could if I did it the normal way
2014-01-02 21:31:01	Los_Plagas	As in, say I tried to do Pikmin 2
2014-01-02 21:31:10	Los_Plagas	Slow, I might even do a no-death run
2014-01-02 21:31:12	Miles	I think I found your problem
2014-01-02 21:31:17	Miles	Speedrunning Pikmin 2
2014-01-02 21:32:26	Los_Plagas	I was going to finish by saying that, whenever I try to speedrun a game like Pikmin 2, I /might/ do it, but I wouldn't even do that great of a speedrun (still a speedrun, but not crazy, CRAZY fast) and plus I would lose like 60 pikmin per dungeon
2014-01-02 21:32:27	Miles	Also, you're generally not supposed to go for no deaths
2014-01-02 21:32:43	Los_Plagas	I know
2014-01-02 21:32:47	Miles	I have ~50 Pikmin die in my Pikmin 3 run
2014-01-02 21:33:02	Miles	Which, admittedly, is mostly thanks to the final boss but still
2014-01-02 21:33:17	Los_Plagas	But it would get so bad that I'd probably have to spend like, 4 or 5 days just building up Pikmin to get ready 
2014-01-02 21:33:22	Los_Plagas	Because I'd lose so much of my army
2014-01-02 21:33:32	Los_Plagas	If I didn't do that, I'd probably get an extinction
2014-01-02 21:34:02	Espyo	well, it requires a balance, of course
2014-01-02 21:34:13	Espyo	and it depends on the type of run, too
2014-01-02 21:34:16	Los_Plagas	Yes
2014-01-02 21:34:23	Los_Plagas	I'd bad at maintaining the balance
2014-01-02 21:34:31	Espyo	for instance, on Pikmin 1, if it's a real-time run, you can't afford to wait for your Pikmin to flower on day 1
2014-01-02 21:34:43	Espyo	whereas on a different type of run, you should
2014-01-02 21:34:46	Los_Plagas	Say it's seperated into 2 categories: "speed" and "skill"
2014-01-02 21:34:55	Espyo	well, it's hard to improvise the strategy to take
2014-01-02 21:34:58	Espyo	that's why it's laid out
2014-01-02 21:35:04	Los_Plagas	I could have like 99% speed and 1% skill
2014-01-02 21:35:06	Espyo	specially on stuff like the sda knowledge base and such
2014-01-02 21:35:12	Miles	https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/charity_questions_about_speed_demos_archives....html
2014-01-02 21:35:15	Miles	I love topics like this
2014-01-02 21:35:26	Espyo	if you want to speedrun, you pretty much have to follow a plan
2014-01-02 21:36:13	Espyo	pfffhaha
2014-01-02 21:36:14	Los_Plagas	Sure, I could lay out hypothetically that I'd do, say, three dungeons a day and be okay with losing, say, 25 Pikmin 
2014-01-02 21:36:15	Espyo	that guy
2014-01-02 21:36:22	Los_Plagas	But in reality, I'd fail 
2014-01-02 21:36:28	Espyo	not that kind of plan
2014-01-02 21:36:28	Los_Plagas	to stick with the plan
2014-01-02 21:36:37	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/7-day_run
2014-01-02 21:36:40	Espyo	more like this kind of plan
2014-01-02 21:36:51	Espyo	where you settle exactly where to go, in what time
2014-01-02 21:37:11	Los_Plagas	I've tried that plan
2014-01-02 21:37:14	Los_Plagas	And it doesn't work for me
2014-01-02 21:37:23	Los_Plagas	Because, like I said, I lose so many Pikmin
2014-01-02 21:37:38	Los_Plagas	They I usually just can't go on without dedicating a day or two to exclusively raising Pikmin
2014-01-02 21:37:56	Miles	Practice
2014-01-02 21:38:00	Miles	Practice practice
2014-01-02 21:38:09	Miles	Practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice practice
2014-01-02 21:38:33	Espyo	naturally you also have to know WHAT to do, not just "get the Anxious Sprout"
2014-01-02 21:38:52	Espyo	oh, the tab with the thread warned me about a new post
2014-01-02 21:38:55	Espyo	that's so great
2014-01-02 21:40:18	Los_Plagas	Of course I try to practice
2014-01-02 21:40:22	Los_Plagas	And I am getting better
2014-01-02 21:40:36	Los_Plagas	So maybe one day, past me will envy my future self
2014-01-02 21:40:48	Los_Plagas	So practice IS working
2014-01-02 21:40:54	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-02 21:41:03	Espyo	though there are speedruns and speedruns
2014-01-02 21:41:15	Espyo	you don't have to do Pikmin 2 in 3 hours
2014-01-02 21:41:25	Espyo	only if you want to compete amongst the best
2014-01-02 21:42:55	Los_Plagas	Which, to be honest, I don't
2014-01-02 21:43:00	Los_Plagas	But to come full-circle
2014-01-02 21:43:05	Los_Plagas	I still envy those who do
2014-01-02 21:43:19	Miles	But we're not "lucky"
2014-01-02 21:43:28	Miles	Speedrunners put a lot of time into it
2014-01-02 21:43:29	Los_Plagas	Oh no, I didn't mean it that way
2014-01-02 21:44:08	Los_Plagas	I meant like, you're lucky that you've got the skill (no matter how you acquired it; whether it be natural or practice [most likely the latter]) which I don't
2014-01-02 21:44:29	Los_Plagas	I didn't mean that you were "lucky" because you didn't have to work for it
2014-01-02 21:44:43	Espyo	huh, doesn't really seem like the guy is trolling
2014-01-02 21:44:44	Los_Plagas	I could kind of compare it to getting a promotion at work
2014-01-02 21:44:46	Espyo	I like his nickname though
2014-01-02 21:45:06	Los_Plagas	Assuming that the person who promoted me isn't biased, I would call myself lucky
2014-01-02 21:45:22	Los_Plagas	But I'd still worked for it and done my best
2014-01-02 21:45:27	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-02 21:46:45	Los_Plagas	It should be kind of obvious how the fundraising works
2014-01-02 21:47:06	Los_Plagas	I think what he really means is, "Why can't anyone just get good at games and then become millionares?"
2014-01-02 21:54:52	@J	so, I saw some great code today
2014-01-02 21:55:05	Espyo	heh
2014-01-02 21:55:09	Espyo	that's always a good thing to hear
2014-01-02 21:55:12	@J	it injects a file into a library to overwrite it, at runtime, then loads the library
2014-01-02 21:55:32	@J	except it doesn't even manage that: it loads it first, by accident
2014-01-02 21:55:38	@J	so it only works the 2nd time you run it
2014-01-02 21:56:10	Espyo	uh, why would it...
2014-01-02 21:56:13	Espyo	is that like a virus?
2014-01-02 21:56:20	@J	oh, and there was a modulo function (recursive, no less), when it's a language builtin
2014-01-02 21:56:28	@J	no, that was some actual code someone I work with wrote
2014-01-02 21:56:30	@J	to do the stuff
2014-01-02 21:56:41	Los_Plagas	"Great code"
2014-01-02 21:56:46	Los_Plagas	I'm assuming that's sarcasm
2014-01-02 21:57:01	Los_Plagas	Because, from what I hear, it doesn't sound like the best code ever written
2014-01-02 21:57:49	@J	yes, sarcasm
2014-01-02 21:58:12	Espyo	modulo as in... modulus?
2014-01-02 22:06:56	@J	yeah, sure
2014-01-02 22:09:02	Espyo	there are a lot of thought in my head about as to how the guy did modulus using recursivity
2014-01-02 22:09:07	Espyo	and none of them are pretty
2014-01-02 22:16:15	@J	http://ikn.org.uk/What_Are_Those_Little_Guys_Even_Doing
2014-01-02 22:16:19	@J	my naming is the best
2014-01-02 22:16:23	Espyo	uh, J...
2014-01-02 22:16:24	Espyo	https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZOO1QOufesKVMSBWSXBzKkhi9-G8lkERMtZfPtZXYw/edit
2014-01-02 22:16:32	Espyo	who's that anon reading the file right now?
2014-01-02 22:16:59	Espyo	TWO anons
2014-01-02 22:17:09	Espyo	if it were 1, I'd dismiss it as a Google bot or something
2014-01-02 22:17:11	Espyo	but two...?
2014-01-02 22:17:15	Los_Plagas	Uhm . . .
2014-01-02 22:17:24	Los_Plagas	I still have that tab with it open for whatever reason
2014-01-02 22:17:26	@J	you ecept me to know?
2014-01-02 22:17:29	@J	*expect
2014-01-02 22:17:44	Los_Plagas	In other words, ONE OF THEM IS ME
2014-01-02 22:17:52	@J	it lists me up there, right?
2014-01-02 22:17:58	Espyo	oh
2014-01-02 22:17:58	@J	just it doesn't list me for me
2014-01-02 22:17:59	Los_Plagas	Ye
2014-01-02 22:18:03	Espyo	it lists you, yes
2014-01-02 22:18:10	Espyo	and one of the anons is Los_Plagas, but
2014-01-02 22:18:17	Espyo	I dunno, I figured you could have an idea
2014-01-02 22:18:39	Espyo	what in the world is an axolotl anyway
2014-01-02 22:18:52	Los_Plagas	I believe it's a kind of salamander
2014-01-02 22:19:03	Espyo	oh, it's a kind of s— yeah
2014-01-02 22:19:21	Espyo	anyway...
2014-01-02 22:19:34	Espyo	looks like you still had a fair bit to go before it got to the theme
2014-01-02 22:19:38	Espyo	as for the name
2014-01-02 22:19:42	Espyo	it's... a name
2014-01-02 22:19:53	Los_Plagas	A top-down shooter about evolution?
2014-01-02 22:19:58	Los_Plagas	I dunno
2014-01-02 22:20:06	Los_Plagas	Maybe it could be ironic
2014-01-02 22:20:08	@J	hint: it's not about evolution
2014-01-02 22:20:12	@J	yet
2014-01-02 22:20:14	@J	yeah, that
2014-01-02 22:20:19	Los_Plagas	*THEM of evolution
2014-01-02 22:20:22	Los_Plagas	*THEME
2014-01-02 22:21:04	@J	so yeah, the idea was that after each level you could pick a modifier to change to benefit you, and the game would pick two modifiers to make it harder
2014-01-02 22:21:12	Espyo	ah
2014-01-02 22:21:20	@J	such as changing the speed, accuracy, intelligence, size, strength, etc. of things
2014-01-02 22:21:30	@J	obstacles and stuff too
2014-01-02 22:21:35	@J	mess up your controls
2014-01-02 22:21:37	Espyo	right
2014-01-02 22:22:11	Espyo	gaaaaaaaaah
2014-01-02 22:22:16	Espyo	what in the world is 31 supposed to mean?!
2014-01-02 22:22:20	@J	31?
2014-01-02 22:22:23	Espyo	it's bad enough to figure out if "10" is 10 or 1
2014-01-02 22:22:29	Espyo	then I had the problem with 11 eggs meaning 2
2014-01-02 22:22:32	Espyo	and now I see a 31!
2014-01-02 22:22:33	@J	oh, right
2014-01-02 22:22:35	@J	probably 3
2014-01-02 22:22:42	Espyo	$1Bomb 31 	# weight
2014-01-02 22:22:42	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-01-02 22:22:50	@J	thanks Testyo
2014-01-02 22:22:50	Espyo	gonna be forced to go che— thanks Testyo —ck
2014-01-02 22:22:51	@J	big help
2014-01-02 22:23:08	Espyo	uuuuuuuuggggghhhh
2014-01-02 22:23:17	Espyo	and going to the Submerged Castle is so horrible
2014-01-02 22:23:25	Espyo	the Bulbear always chooses to go the way I go
2014-01-02 22:23:29	Espyo	and I can't take one Blue with me
2014-01-02 22:23:34	Espyo	there's a clog on sublevel 2 and 3
2014-01-02 22:23:35	@J	when you make 'ugh' longer, it gives the impression you're just throwing up
2014-01-02 22:23:37	Espyo	I don't want to stay there forever
2014-01-02 22:23:40	Espyo	it does
2014-01-02 22:24:00	Espyo	well, I don't remember sublevel 4 having 31 bomb-rocks
2014-01-02 22:24:06	Espyo	or any sublevel of anything, really
2014-01-02 22:24:11	Espyo	screw it, I'll leave a ToDo
2014-01-02 22:24:20	Espyo	I already have to confirm a lot of ToDos anyway
2014-01-02 22:24:43	Espyo	oh, there are 2 lines about 31 bomb-rocks
2014-01-02 22:24:50	Espyo	so I honestly doubt there's 62 of them
2014-01-02 22:25:38	Los_Plagas	The Bulbear is SUPPOSED to be evil
2014-01-02 22:26:31	Espyo	well yeah
2014-01-02 22:26:37	Espyo	but I don't want to be bothered by it..
2014-01-02 22:26:38	Espyo	*.
2014-01-02 22:26:58	@J	the bomb rocks in sublevel 4 are falling ones
2014-01-02 22:27:06	Espyo	they are, yes
2014-01-02 22:27:12	Espyo	it's what the dollar sign that Testyo caught means
2014-01-02 22:27:16	@J	ah
2014-01-02 22:27:18	Espyo	the 1 is the height at which they spawn, I believe
2014-01-02 22:27:23	@J	hmm
2014-01-02 22:27:32	Espyo	I've seen Volatile Dweevils with $4
2014-01-02 22:27:32	Testyo	$ 4 = 2.9488 € / £ 2.522 
2014-01-02 22:27:46	Espyo	seen others with 1.5€ too
2014-01-02 22:27:46	Testyo	1.5 € = £ 1.2828  / $ 2.0346 
2014-01-02 22:27:53	Espyo	heh
2014-01-02 22:28:07	Los_Plagas	This makes it seem like Volatile Dweevils are dirt poor
2014-01-02 22:28:10	Espyo	anyway, I don't quite care about the height number or whatever it might be
2014-01-02 22:28:12	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-02 22:28:22	Espyo	though they are pretty tiny, I bet a dime would be worth a lot
2014-01-02 22:28:47	Los_Plagas	I wonder what the height number really means (besides how far up they are when they fall, of course)
2014-01-02 22:28:53	Los_Plagas	Does it mean how long it takes for them to fall?
2014-01-02 22:29:22	Espyo	doesn't seem to be seconds
2014-01-02 22:29:23	Los_Plagas	Like, a bigger number could imply a dweevil that's supposed to get you once you've stopped expecting it?
2014-01-02 22:29:27	Espyo	might just be height in some units
2014-01-02 22:29:48	Espyo	no, I think a $1 appears from above, but close to you
2014-01-02 22:29:48	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-01-02 22:29:58	Espyo	while a $4 appears really high, and you don't even see the poof cloud
2014-01-02 22:29:59	Testyo	$ 4 = 2.9488 € / £ 2.522 
2014-01-02 22:30:04	Los_Plagas	Also, I think there're some Volatile Dweevils that spawn ONLY when you have Pikmin to maximize the damage
2014-01-02 22:30:06	Espyo	I remember seeing some enemies spawn without seeing their clouds
2014-01-02 22:30:09	Los_Plagas	Yeah, that's kinda what I meant
2014-01-02 22:30:14	Espyo	so they must spawn from so high above that I don't see it
2014-01-02 22:30:21	Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2014-01-02 22:30:31	Los_Plagas	I mean, wouldn't a bigger fall # mean it takes more time to fall?
2014-01-02 22:30:33	Espyo	wonder if that's what the dollar sign actually means?
2014-01-02 22:30:45	Espyo	yeah, but it's more likely the number correlates to distance
2014-01-02 22:30:53	Espyo	they'd have to factor in the gravity and such to calculate an accurate time
2014-01-02 22:30:59	Espyo	and it doesn't need to be super precise to begin with
2014-01-02 22:31:17	Espyo	anyway, yeah, it could be like $1 = only appear if 25+ Pikmin are around
2014-01-02 22:31:17	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-01-02 22:31:25	Espyo	whereas $4 = only appear if 100 Pikmin are alive
2014-01-02 22:31:25	Testyo	$ 4 = 2.9488 € / £ 2.522 
2014-01-02 22:31:40	Espyo	I never really went to any cave with less than 100
2014-01-02 22:31:53	Espyo	which really makes me wonder how I've caught so many Bulbmin when I played
2014-01-02 22:32:01	Espyo	don't remember dying so much
2014-01-02 22:32:29	Los_Plagas	In my first time playing Pikmin 2, I lost 50 Pikmin playing Submerged Castle
2014-01-02 22:32:32	Los_Plagas	10 were Bulbmin
2014-01-02 22:32:41	Los_Plagas	no no no
2014-01-02 22:32:46	Los_Plagas	I meant 40 were Bulbmin
2014-01-02 22:32:58	Los_Plagas	So 10 were my own Pikmin that I could've taken out of the dungeon
2014-01-02 22:33:19	Los_Plagas	How did I get so many Bulbmin while only losing that amount of regular Pikmin?!

2014-01-02 22:33:39	Los_Plagas	(I went in with 100 Pikmin)
2014-01-02 22:33:47	Espyo	the Submerged Castle has the most Bulbmin in the game, 40
2014-01-02 22:33:50	Espyo	(right...?)
2014-01-02 22:33:59	Los_Plagas	That's what it says in our article
2014-01-02 22:34:01	Espyo	((I at least know it has 40 (it's on the wiki)))
2014-01-02 22:34:06	Los_Plagas	But if I went in with 100
2014-01-02 22:34:09	Espyo	(((not quite sure about it being the most)))
2014-01-02 22:34:16	Los_Plagas	And only lost 10
2014-01-02 22:34:29	Los_Plagas	Wouldn't that mean that, at most, I could only have 10 Bulbmin?
2014-01-02 22:34:41	Los_Plagas	But no, I got the maximum amount of Bulbmin possible
2014-01-02 22:35:39	Espyo	yeah...
2014-01-02 22:35:45	Espyo	maybe memory playing tricks on you
2014-01-02 22:37:18	Los_Plagas	Perhaps
2014-01-02 22:37:34	Los_Plagas	But I've always felt like Bulbmin trigger strange warps in reality . . .
2014-01-02 22:37:40	Los_Plagas	Yes, I think it might be my memory.
2014-01-02 22:37:54	Los_Plagas	Hmm - does the game keep records on your caves?
2014-01-02 22:38:03	Los_Plagas	I mean, on your stats for each cave
2014-01-02 22:39:08	Espyo	what do you mean?
2014-01-02 22:39:20	Espyo	the game doesn't save any sort of information for any individual cave, if that's what you're asking
2014-01-02 22:39:35	Los_Plagas	I mean
2014-01-02 22:40:07	Los_Plagas	Would it be possible for someone to somehow hack into the game and check how many Pikmin I lost to one specific cave?
2014-01-02 22:40:13	Los_Plagas	It definitely keeps a tally overall
2014-01-02 22:40:14	Espyo	nope
2014-01-02 22:40:23	Espyo	it doesn't keep records on that at all
2014-01-02 22:40:39	Espyo	the absolute most, is that it's saved in RAM how many Pikmin you lost on the current cave
2014-01-02 22:40:45	Espyo	so it can show you when you complete the cave
2014-01-02 22:40:49	Espyo	but after that it forgets it forever
2014-01-02 22:43:17	Espyo	uh oh
2014-01-02 22:43:19	Espyo	TVTrash
2014-01-02 22:46:17	Espyo	why is TVTrash behaving it
2014-01-02 22:46:20	Espyo	*behaving

2014-01-03 00:01:32	Miles	Why is there ambient sound effects everywhere in Pikmin 2
2014-01-03 00:01:41	Miles	I was trying to record some sound effects this morning
2014-01-03 00:01:52	Miles	Was much harder than it should've been...
2014-01-03 00:02:42	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-03 00:02:46	Espyo	that's why caves work well for that
2014-01-03 00:02:47	Espyo	wait
2014-01-03 00:02:50	Espyo	why do you want sound effects
2014-01-03 00:02:54	Espyo	they're ripped already
2014-01-03 00:02:57	Espyo	J: give him the l—
2014-01-03 00:02:58	Espyo	drat
2014-01-03 00:03:09	Espyo	uh, let me just finish this and I'll give you a zip with all the sound effects
2014-01-03 00:03:15	Espyo	bar stuff like the C-stick whistle
2014-01-03 00:03:49	Miles	Well
2014-01-03 00:03:57	Miles	The C-stick whistle was what I wanted
2014-01-03 00:03:58	Miles	lol
2014-01-03 00:04:01	Miles	I already got it
2014-01-03 00:04:19	Miles	Anyway, caves don't work well
2014-01-03 00:04:31	Miles	As 1. They also have ambience. Everywhere has ambience.
2014-01-03 00:04:40	Miles	2. They add an echo to the sound effects
2014-01-03 00:04:58	Espyo	:|
2014-01-03 00:05:04	Espyo	aww, drat then
2014-01-03 00:05:16	Espyo	we also need the C-stick whistle for the wiki
2014-01-03 00:05:16	Miles	I ended up cutting off the last 5 MB of the wScene_0 file >_>
2014-01-03 00:05:34	Espyo	what's wrong with the last 5 MB?
2014-01-03 00:05:52	Miles	That's where the ambient sounds are
2014-01-03 00:06:10	Miles	Swarming sound was somwhere in the first 3 MB

2014-01-03 01:19:12	Testyo	Oh, PikFan, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 02/01/2014 19:40 (GMT), saying: fun exercise: count how many things are incorrect in this http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Submerged_Castle.
2014-01-03 01:19:23	Los_Plagas	I counted already
2014-01-03 01:19:26	Espyo	oh, just as I was going to bed
2014-01-03 01:19:30	Los_Plagas	I counted already
2014-01-03 01:19:37	Los_Plagas	Ugh, accidentally pressed up
2014-01-03 01:19:44	Los_Plagas	There were a bunch of erros
2014-01-03 01:19:52	Los_Plagas	But Espyo said he'd fixed most of the ones in our article
2014-01-03 01:20:43	Los_Plagas	At any rate, I discovered something new while reading wikia (shocker, seriously): the Submerged Castle themes have a bunch of names
2014-01-03 01:20:45	Los_Plagas	Unofficial
2014-01-03 01:20:52	Los_Plagas	But the Internet calls them by that
2014-01-03 01:20:52	Espyo	I don't even think we had errors
2014-01-03 01:20:55	Espyo	just missing info
2014-01-03 01:21:05	Los_Plagas	Yah
2014-01-03 01:21:07	Los_Plagas	Still, though
2014-01-03 01:21:21	Los_Plagas	I think there might be a few articles that've been barely updated since Wikia days
2014-01-03 01:21:29	Los_Plagas	Mostly the small ones, with minor stuff
2014-01-03 01:21:38	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-03 01:21:39	Los_Plagas	Can't think of an example right off the bat, thoug
2014-01-03 01:21:49	Espyo	though for wikia, it really makes me wonder
2014-01-03 01:22:00	Espyo	there's like 50 edits per day, from all sorts of people
2014-01-03 01:22:03	Espyo	hundreds of visits a day
2014-01-03 01:22:11	Espyo	and yet nobody ever noticed that [[Hazard]] doesn't link anywhere?
2014-01-03 01:22:19	Espyo	they don't even /deserve/ what they have
2014-01-03 01:23:02	Los_Plagas	To be fair, not too many casual browsers care about hazards
2014-01-03 01:23:11	Los_Plagas	But I think Wikis should cover everything
2014-01-03 01:23:18	Miles	Random fact, the final floor does have a timer
2014-01-03 01:23:24	Miles	20 seconds or something
2014-01-03 01:23:29	Los_Plagas	It's like saying a dictionary shouldn't have the word "discombobulated' because no one uses it
2014-01-03 01:23:35	Los_Plagas	Espyo figured that out before
2014-01-03 01:23:38	Miles	If you get to the center before then the Waterwraith won't drop
2014-01-03 01:23:40	Los_Plagas	He estimated it to 15 seconds
2014-01-03 01:23:43	Los_Plagas	Close enough
2014-01-03 01:23:55	Miles	Well, there's no need for estimating...
2014-01-03 01:24:00	Miles	It's in the game's files
2014-01-03 01:24:07	Espyo	yeah, we have it pointed out
2014-01-03 01:24:07	Los_Plagas	Well, he /called/ it 15 seconds, I think
2014-01-03 01:24:08	Espyo	it's 15 seconds
2014-01-03 01:24:26	Espyo	well, it's "15"
2014-01-03 01:24:27	@PikFan	odd
2014-01-03 01:24:45	@PikFan	it usually takes me longer to cultivate and flower the Purple Pikmin
2014-01-03 01:24:46	Espyo	doesn't say it's seconds, but it's 15
2014-01-03 01:24:51	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-03 01:24:53	Los_Plagas	Wait, Miles
2014-01-03 01:24:59	Los_Plagas	Or Espyo
2014-01-03 01:25:14	Los_Plagas	Will the Waterwraith drop down if you don't go into the center?
2014-01-03 01:25:17	Miles	No
2014-01-03 01:25:30	Los_Plagas	I'm pretty sure that I've seen the Waterwraith drop by itself
2014-01-03 01:25:35	Espyo	^
2014-01-03 01:25:40	Espyo	I'm kinda confused now
2014-01-03 01:26:17	Miles	It's kind of funny because EVERY cave floor in the game has a Waterwraith timer
2014-01-03 01:26:29	Miles	Which is 0
2014-01-03 01:26:53	Los_Plagas	Bwahaha
2014-01-03 01:27:01	Los_Plagas	Imagine the Waterwraith appearing on every floor
2014-01-03 01:27:03	Los_Plagas	in the game
2014-01-03 01:27:05	@PikFan	or maybe they should make it 1 million seconds
2014-01-03 01:27:16	@PikFan	which is about 21 days
2014-01-03 01:27:37	@PikFan	so you'd have to leave the game on for 21 days just to get the Waterwraith to appear
2014-01-03 01:27:51	Los_Plagas	I'm sure some fanatics have left the game on for that amount of time to get something to happen
2014-01-03 01:27:57	Los_Plagas	People will do anything 
2014-01-03 01:28:12	@PikFan	I'm obsessed, but not THAT obsessed
2014-01-03 01:28:27	Los_Plagas	IIRC, I was looking at the Club Penguin wiki for some reason, and there's a clock somewhere that counts down for an obscenely long amount of time
2014-01-03 01:28:44	Los_Plagas	Plus, Club Penguin resets if you don't do anything with it for, like, 5 minutes
2014-01-03 01:28:59	Los_Plagas	Someone discovered that, once the clock reaches the end, it starts counting /forward/
2014-01-03 01:31:58	Espyo	heh...
2014-01-03 01:32:03	Espyo	funny you should mention that
2014-01-03 01:32:13	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmWgcM0CkKw
2014-01-03 01:34:41	Espyo	never underestimate the players
2014-01-03 01:34:49	Espyo	a lot of things were found out by standing still doing nothing
2014-01-03 01:34:55	Espyo	heck, Totaka's Song in Pikmin 2 for a fine example
2014-01-03 01:36:23	Los_Plagas	At least Pikmin 2 doesn't reset every 5 minutes . . .
2014-01-03 01:36:34	Los_Plagas	You can literally leave Pikmin 2 on the whole night
2014-01-03 01:36:44	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-03 01:37:48	Espyo	before I go, I just want to point out
2014-01-03 01:38:03	Espyo	at least 3 caves have their final floor's hole closed with a clog
2014-01-03 01:38:10	Espyo	even though the final floor HAS no hole
2014-01-03 01:38:46	Los_Plagas	Wut
2014-01-03 01:38:51	Los_Plagas	Wow
2014-01-03 01:39:06	Espyo	yep
2014-01-03 01:39:11	@PikFan	weird
2014-01-03 01:39:12	Espyo	I think I found 4 caves so far with that
2014-01-03 01:39:15	Los_Plagas	Hmm
2014-01-03 01:39:18	Espyo	but at least 3 I'm sure of
2014-01-03 01:39:24	Espyo	did I not say this fun fact here before?
2014-01-03 01:39:26	@PikFan	which caves?
2014-01-03 01:39:27	Los_Plagas	Is there a model of a hole on those floors, but simply hidden somehow?
2014-01-03 01:39:28	@PikFan	no
2014-01-03 01:39:33	Espyo	Los_Plagas: I don't think so
2014-01-03 01:39:52	Espyo	the ones I pointed down are the Subterranean Complex, Hole of Beasts, and Bulblax Kingdom
2014-01-03 01:40:04	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-03 01:41:02	Los_Plagas	Is it possible there were originally planned to be more floors, but those were cut?
2014-01-03 01:41:37	Espyo	not really, but it is mysterious
2014-01-03 01:41:47	Espyo	nothing else hints at leftover configurations for extra sublevels
2014-01-03 01:42:16	Espyo	though there are tons of unused floors
2014-01-03 01:42:20	Espyo	not on any of the existing caves, though
2014-01-03 01:42:31	@PikFan	hey Espyo
2014-01-03 01:42:34	Espyo	hmm?
2014-01-03 01:42:39	@PikFan	if you were to make a fan game
2014-01-03 01:42:47	Espyo	WOO
2014-01-03 01:42:50	@PikFan	how long would the longest cave be
2014-01-03 01:42:53	Espyo	I can reset Cookie Clicker!
2014-01-03 01:43:04	Espyo	I can now reach 2k Heavenly Chips!
2014-01-03 01:43:05	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -4848.7 °F
2014-01-03 01:43:14	Espyo	yes Testyo, negative 4000 degrees
2014-01-03 01:43:14	Testyo	4000 degrees = 69.8132 rad
2014-01-03 01:43:24	Espyo	anyway, I wouldn't exactly write an "if"...
2014-01-03 01:43:36	Espyo	you see, I'm actually planning on making one
2014-01-03 01:43:37	Espyo	using the engine
2014-01-03 01:43:52	Espyo	and I've got quite a lot of the elements pointed down already
2014-01-03 01:44:07	Espyo	provided I have enough time to complete the engine and make a fangame, I will
2014-01-03 01:44:17	Espyo	though that's kind of a tough question
2014-01-03 01:44:25	Espyo	but I would likely stick to 15 sublevels for the max
2014-01-03 01:44:50	Espyo	related: there's a file called last_4 with 32 sublevels, in Pikmin 2
2014-01-03 01:45:00	Espyo	"last_" being the Wistful Wild caves

2014-01-03 02:01:16	@PikFan	Los_Plagas, what just happened
2014-01-03 02:03:44	Los_Plagas	Did you get terminated too?
2014-01-03 02:03:46	Los_Plagas	I did
2014-01-03 02:03:51	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-03 02:03:55	Los_Plagas	No idea
2014-01-03 02:04:37	@PikFan	oh, apparently we had a ping timeout
2014-01-03 02:04:47	@PikFan	which means we lost connection to the server
2014-01-03 02:05:43	Los_Plagas	Oh, that's why
2014-01-03 02:05:56	Los_Plagas	Wait, so was it a problem with the server?
2014-01-03 02:06:04	Los_Plagas	Or did we just have a synchronized ping fail?
2014-01-03 02:07:03	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-01-03 02:07:20	Los_Plagas	Eh
2014-01-03 02:07:30	Los_Plagas	So, got Pikmin 3 . . .
2014-01-03 02:09:01	@PikFan	you got Pikmin 3?
2014-01-03 02:09:03	@PikFan	nice
2014-01-03 02:09:44	@PikFan	do you have the NTSC or PAL version
2014-01-03 02:09:56	Los_Plagas	Oh, no
2014-01-03 02:10:01	Los_Plagas	I was talking about you, sorry
2014-01-03 02:10:19	Los_Plagas	If I do get Pikmin 3, I would get NTSC, though, since I live in US
2014-01-03 02:10:43	Los_Plagas	I wish I hadn't misunderstood
2014-01-03 02:10:50	Los_Plagas	Because good god do I want Pikmin 3
2014-01-03 02:11:02	@PikFan	ah
2014-01-03 02:11:04	@PikFan	yes
2014-01-03 02:11:08	@PikFan	I have Pikmin 3
2014-01-03 02:11:15	@PikFan	I already beat it... kinda
2014-01-03 02:11:18	@PikFan	I mean
2014-01-03 02:11:27	@PikFan	I got to the final boss but I didn't collect all fruit
2014-01-03 02:11:37	Los_Plagas	Hmm
2014-01-03 02:11:44	Los_Plagas	When did you get it?
2014-01-03 02:11:53	@PikFan	Christmad
2014-01-03 02:11:55	Los_Plagas	It actually seems to me that Pikmin 3 is relatively short
2014-01-03 02:11:56	@PikFan	*Christmas
2014-01-03 02:12:02	Los_Plagas	But maybe I'm just misunderstanding the time-frame
2014-01-03 02:12:04	@PikFan	yes, it is
2014-01-03 02:12:08	Los_Plagas	So
2014-01-03 02:12:12	@PikFan	compared to Pikmin 2, it's shorter
2014-01-03 02:12:15	Miles	I played it for 8 hours straight when I first got it
2014-01-03 02:12:16	Los_Plagas	You beat it in about 7 days?
2014-01-03 02:12:17	Miles	Streamed
2014-01-03 02:12:19	Miles	It was fun
2014-01-03 02:12:25	@PikFan	but it's longer than Pikmin 1
2014-01-03 02:12:44	Los_Plagas	By the way, what happens if you run out of fruit?
2014-01-03 02:12:47	Miles	Game Over
2014-01-03 02:12:59	Los_Plagas	Woa
2014-01-03 02:13:03	Miles	It's very lenient
2014-01-03 02:13:09	Miles	With all fruit you have 99 in-game days
2014-01-03 02:13:21	Los_Plagas	So there's a limited amount of fruit?
2014-01-03 02:13:24	Miles	Yes
2014-01-03 02:13:25	@PikFan	except when you-know-who steals all your juice
2014-01-03 02:13:37	@PikFan	it becomes imperative to collect fruit
2014-01-03 02:14:07	Los_Plagas	Is you-know-who Britney?
2014-01-03 02:14:11	Miles	It opens up an area with 8 fruit all together
2014-01-03 02:14:13	Miles	Maybe
2014-01-03 02:14:17	@PikFan	maybe not
2014-01-03 02:14:38	Los_Plagas	Oh wait
2014-01-03 02:14:46	Los_Plagas	Cue lightbulb
2014-01-03 02:14:56	Los_Plagas	Louie has always seemed evil to me
2014-01-03 02:14:59	Los_Plagas	The Titan Dweevil incident?
2014-01-03 02:15:05	Los_Plagas	His first crime
2014-01-03 02:15:15	Miles	Huh?
2014-01-03 02:15:16	Los_Plagas	(Plus I saw a picture on the wiki of Louie tied up in the Drake)
2014-01-03 02:15:19	Los_Plagas	Was it Louie?
2014-01-03 02:15:30	@PikFan	...yes
2014-01-03 02:15:39	Miles	The whole "eating all of the golden Pikpik carrots and sending his company into a huge debt" happened long before then
2014-01-03 02:16:09	Los_Plagas	Oh, yeah, that
2014-01-03 02:16:21	Miles	Also he's not evil for it, though his motivation isn't explained in-game
2014-01-03 02:16:28	@PikFan	but when Louie was recovered from the TD, the Ship said he was unconscious
2014-01-03 02:16:45	@PikFan	so he probably wasn't controlling the TD
2014-01-03 02:17:05	Los_Plagas	Hmm
2014-01-03 02:17:13	Los_Plagas	Yeh, that's true
2014-01-03 02:17:44	Los_Plagas	Wouldn't Louie then be the main antagonist of Pikmin 2?
2014-01-03 02:18:04	Los_Plagas	Pikmin 2 never really gets appreciated for that freaking /mastermind/ plot twist
2014-01-03 02:18:18	Los_Plagas	Not many people think about the fact they've been controlling the villain of the game
2014-01-03 02:18:35	@PikFan	well in the Louie's Dark Secret cutscene, it states that "he couldn't suppress his powerful hunger..."
2014-01-03 02:19:15	Los_Plagas	So he made up a story about space bunnies.
2014-01-03 02:19:16	Los_Plagas	Naturally.
2014-01-03 02:19:34	Los_Plagas	Besides, it's not like Louie's dirt-poor or anything
2014-01-03 02:21:59	Los_Plagas	Also, I find the entire concept of "space bunnies" ridiculous
2014-01-03 02:22:18	Los_Plagas	The President believes in them, though, so it's implied their actually real
2014-01-03 02:22:28	Los_Plagas	They just weren't the culprit this time

2014-01-03 02:35:30	Los_Plagas	There are a few things ABSOLUTELY NUTS about this
2014-01-03 02:35:43	@PikFan	I thought Espyo was going to become the admin?
2014-01-03 02:35:52	Los_Plagas	1. I contacted him on his real-life Twitter account and specifically requested to make Espyo the admin
2014-01-03 02:36:02	Los_Plagas	Next message I get? "I made you an admin on the Facebook

2014-01-03 02:37:20	Los_Plagas	He only made me a basic admin
2014-01-03 02:37:22	@PikFan	then go ahead and make —

2014-01-03 02:37:48	Los_Plagas	I really don't know what's going through his mind
2014-01-03 02:38:02	Los_Plagas	For god's sake
2014-01-03 02:38:05	Los_Plagas	I specifically said Espyo
2014-01-03 02:38:17	Los_Plagas	So that means he went out of his way to do something entirely different from what I'd intentioned
2014-01-03 02:38:26	Los_Plagas	HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DO THIS
2014-01-03 02:38:28	@PikFan	who knows why he did it
2014-01-03 02:38:36	@PikFan	does Espyo know about this
2014-01-03 02:38:43	Los_Plagas	Yes, Espyo knows
2014-01-03 02:39:10	Los_Plagas	I've been considering messaging Revan again, but Espyo told me it should be fine if I can make occasional posts to the page, since that's what he was going to do
2014-01-03 02:39:27	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-03 02:39:46	Los_Plagas	I really dunno if I can find the time to do this, though; Espyo tells me he goes on Facebook for a bit everyday

2014-01-05 17:36:27	Espyo	it's understandable as it is

2014-01-05 17:38:17	Espyo	I could swear you used to not be able to
2014-01-05 17:38:40	@J	yeah, I thought that too
2014-01-05 17:38:46	@J	it just magically works now

2014-01-05 17:41:48	Prezintenden	it said on that page

2014-01-05 17:49:04	@J	wow
2014-01-05 17:49:14	@J	there's a tool to convert code from Python 2 to Python 3

2014-01-05 17:49:25	@J	+        list(self.throw(False(evt)))
2014-01-05 17:49:27	@J	that
2014-01-05 17:49:29	Espyo	it left a parenthesis unclosed?
2014-01-05 17:49:29	Espyo	oh
2014-01-05 17:49:41	Espyo	uh... that sounds incredibly wrong
2014-01-05 17:50:13	@J	I worked out why: it thinks self is a generator, and generator.throw changed
2014-01-05 17:50:21	@J	it's assuming False is a valid first argument
2014-01-05 17:50:22	@J	http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#generator.throw
2014-01-05 17:50:28	@J	it's pretty funny, though

2014-01-05 17:58:36	@J	so this game increases memory usage by about 11MiB per round

2014-01-05 18:01:26	Espyo	ugh, memory leaks
2014-01-05 18:01:30	Espyo	doesn't Python have garbage collection?
2014-01-05 18:02:43	@J	yeah, but it can still happen
2014-01-05 18:02:50	Espyo	right
2014-01-05 18:02:58	@J	it's reference counting, so if a reference isn't severed
2014-01-05 18:03:12	@J	and also I wrote some C code for this, so it could be in there

2014-01-05 18:34:48	@J	and there we go
2014-01-05 18:35:06	@J	there's a Counter being left running that references the Player that references the Level, somehow
2014-01-05 18:35:55	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-05 18:35:59	Espyo	but what exactly is that?
2014-01-05 18:36:06	Espyo	a flowchart / class diagram combo?
2014-01-05 18:36:11	@J	http://www.stuartmitchell.com/journal/2011/8/5/finding-python-memory-leaks-with-objgraph.html
2014-01-05 18:36:15	@J	hmm
2014-01-05 18:36:22	Espyo	ah
2014-01-05 18:36:23	@J	it shows references between objects
2014-01-05 18:36:39	Espyo	yeah, I get it now
2014-01-05 18:36:43	@J	and that tool is pretty useful
2014-01-05 18:36:49	Espyo	really nifty
2014-01-05 18:37:03	Espyo	I think there are a few tools to help memory leaks in C++, but nothing this fancy
2014-01-05 18:37:04	@J	it's the counter that counts down to the next time to play the walking sound
2014-01-05 18:37:07	@J	who would've thought
2014-01-05 18:37:14	@J	yeah, Valgrind is amazing
2014-01-05 18:37:35	@J	if you have C/C++ code, run Valgrind on it, and it just tells you what's wrong with that
2014-01-05 18:37:41	@J	*with it
2014-01-05 18:41:05	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-05 18:41:11	Espyo	apparently you talked about this before
2014-01-05 18:41:16	Espyo	either that, or I found Valgrind on my own
2014-01-05 18:41:21	Espyo	'cause I have a page on my history
2014-01-05 18:41:39	@J	2013-02-25 14:12:21     <@J>    okay, Valgrind is amazing

2014-01-05 18:48:48	Espyo	great, it means 10
2014-01-05 18:49:07	Espyo	I think
2014-01-05 18:49:12	Espyo	the wiki says there's 15 in total
2014-01-05 18:49:16	Espyo	the files say 42, 40 and 40
2014-01-05 18:50:48	Espyo	also Common Glowcaps is 12
2014-01-05 18:50:53	Espyo	is this 3, 12, 10, ...?
2014-01-05 18:50:55	Espyo	gaaaaaaaaah
2014-01-05 18:50:59	Espyo	good grief Nintendo
2014-01-05 18:57:37	Espyo	and how in the world doesn't this subfloor contain an exit geyser?
2014-01-05 18:57:43	Espyo	it's the only sublevel in the Red Chasm!
2014-01-05 18:57:47	Espyo	I think this file is broken

2014-01-05 18:58:38	@J	I have no idea what this means
2014-01-05 19:00:51	Espyo	doesn't it make sense in context?
2014-01-05 19:12:45	@J	I don't even know
2014-01-05 19:12:52	@J	probably
2014-01-05 19:12:56	@J	at the time I wrote it
2014-01-05 19:13:07	Espyo	hehehehe
2014-01-05 19:15:54	@J	okay, I found the real cause of the leak
2014-01-05 19:16:20	@J	apparently I decided at some point that it would be a good idea to provide some globally available keyboard keys (ALT, CTRL, etc.)
2014-01-05 19:16:39	@J	and then for keyboard keys to reference the EventHandler that contains them
2014-01-05 19:17:08	Espyo	heh
2014-01-05 19:17:54	@J	...still doesn't fix everything, so there must be another leak
2014-01-05 19:18:12	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-05 19:18:25	Espyo	well that diagram didn't really make it look like there was anything else
2014-01-05 19:18:42	@J	that was a wrong thing
2014-01-05 19:18:51	@J	there was a reference in the debugger, somehow
2014-01-05 19:18:56	@J	so it wasn't important
2014-01-05 19:19:12	@J	http://i.imgur.com/TV6kuDz.png

2014-01-05 19:19:22	Espyo	hah
2014-01-05 19:22:05	@J	oh, I did fix it
2014-01-05 19:22:12	@J	it just takes a while to get cleaned up
2014-01-05 19:23:21	Espyo	oh
2014-01-05 19:25:22	@J	and now I should really make some food

2014-01-06 00:06:45	@PikFan	so I started adding notes a couple of nights ago

2014-01-06 00:08:01	@PikFan	also I had so many stats for objects I listed down that I had to get a second paper

2014-01-06 00:12:09	Espyo	say, two days ago, when I said I was planning a fangame, both you and Los_Plagas quit of ping timeout

2014-01-06 00:12:54	@PikFan	I... don't know

2014-01-06 01:05:36	Espyo	neat
2014-01-06 01:05:53	@PikFan	...SPECIFICALLY listing the location of each fruit
2014-01-06 01:06:15	@PikFan	and I wanted to find all the fruit for myself
2014-01-06 01:06:27	Espyo	well, try not reading it
2014-01-06 01:06:27	@PikFan	well, I guess I'll ignore the checklist, then
2014-01-06 01:14:21	@PikFan	also I have a question
2014-01-06 01:14:37	@PikFan	there are some fruits in the game that are split into several pieces
2014-01-06 01:15:00	@PikFan	how would we describe their carry weights/max carriers?
2014-01-06 01:15:53	@PikFan	for example, the Disguised Delicacy has its other half
2014-01-06 01:16:10	@PikFan	so you've got two halves of one fruit
2014-01-06 01:17:39	Gamefreak75	both halves are counted as one fruit, right
2014-01-06 01:17:45	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-06 01:18:07	Gamefreak75	i think just like X pikmin (Each half)
2014-01-06 01:18:16	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-06 01:18:22	Espyo	no need to have info on the whole fruit
2014-01-06 01:18:39	@PikFan	okay
2014-01-06 01:18:50	@PikFan	but then there's one fruit that splits into six pieces
2014-01-06 01:18:59	@PikFan	and they each weigh differently

2014-01-06 03:17:05	@PikFan	a day in Pikmin 3 lasts exactly 13 minutes
2014-01-06 03:17:53	@PikFan	meaning that 65 seconds represents 1 hour

2014-01-06 03:19:04	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-06 03:19:32	@PikFan	and 1 minute is 1.0833 seconds
2014-01-06 03:20:10	@PikFan	...so 1 second is 0.018055 seconds
2014-01-06 03:22:10	Espyo	he
2014-01-06 03:22:12	Espyo	*h
2014-01-06 03:28:16	Espyo	I...
2014-01-06 03:28:23	Espyo	they /reprogrammed/ Super Mario World
2014-01-06 03:28:24	Espyo	using a TAS
2014-01-06 03:30:10	@PikFan	...what
2014-01-06 03:32:38	Espyo	you know TAS?
2014-01-06 03:33:30	Espyo	gotta go to bed, so I'll answer real quick
2014-01-06 03:33:45	Espyo	TAS is when you use tools to go save the game and reload whenever something goes wrong
2014-01-06 03:33:49	Espyo	and play in super slow motion
2014-01-06 03:33:55	Espyo	in order to correct mistakes and have super-human reflexes
2014-01-06 03:34:03	Espyo	and basically make a speedrun that has impossible skill
2014-01-06 03:34:07	Espyo	well, they took it to the next level
2014-01-06 03:34:13	Espyo	they messed with Super Mario World left and right
2014-01-06 03:34:18	Espyo	abusing some glitches that mess with the memory
2014-01-06 03:34:22	Espyo	they did stuff, and stuff, and stuff...
2014-01-06 03:34:28	Espyo	and in the end, Super Mario World has 2 new games inside them
2014-01-06 03:34:38	Espyo	with all the crazy stuff they did internally, using all those perfection tools
2014-01-06 03:34:50	Espyo	they hacked the memory of the game to REPROGRAM it
2014-01-06 03:34:56	Espyo	using JUST the SNES' buttons
2014-01-06 03:36:35	@PikFan	...wow
2014-01-06 03:36:40	@PikFan	that is
2014-01-06 03:36:42	@PikFan	just
2014-01-06 03:36:46	Espyo	speechless
2014-01-06 03:36:47	@PikFan	beyond amazing
2014-01-06 03:36:53	Espyo	I have been following the TAS scene for years now
2014-01-06 03:37:02	Espyo	I know how far they go to maximize everything
2014-01-06 03:37:03	@PikFan	what's TAS short for
2014-01-06 03:37:19	Espyo	I've seen runs where they exploit glitches, use extreme shortcuts, and so much precision, that it's incredible
2014-01-06 03:37:28	Espyo	I've come to the point where an extreme trick in a run is kinda normal
2014-01-06 03:37:36	Espyo	and even *I* dropped my jaw to the ground now
2014-01-06 03:37:44	Espyo	*AND* I had already seen a "reprogram game" TAS before
2014-01-06 03:37:55	Espyo	it's short for Tool-Assisted Speedrun
2014-01-06 03:38:02	Espyo	or in this case, a Tool-Assisted Superplay
2014-01-06 03:38:14	@PikFan	so in other words, it's hacking
2014-01-06 03:38:20	Espyo	not quite
2014-01-06 03:38:25	Espyo	the game is /exactly/ the same
2014-01-06 03:38:35	Espyo	whatever they do, and I do mean whatever, can be exactly reproduced on a console
2014-01-06 03:38:43	Espyo	in fact, they did it on stream just now
2014-01-06 03:38:50	Espyo	they used a bot to play the TAS outside of an emulator
2014-01-06 03:38:51	@PikFan	wow
2014-01-06 03:38:57	Espyo	a real physical SNES with a physical SMW did that run
2014-01-06 03:39:03	Espyo	which altered the game's physical memory
2014-01-06 03:39:12	Espyo	it's all the game's doing, and the button presses
2014-01-06 03:39:19	Espyo	no action replay or anything
2014-01-06 03:39:22	@PikFan	so the game is playing itself?
2014-01-06 03:39:30	Espyo	more like a bot-like thing is playing the game
2014-01-06 03:39:38	Espyo	ok, it's a bit more like this
2014-01-06 03:39:46	Espyo	when you're making the speedrun, you go back in time, and slow motion, and whatnot
2014-01-06 03:39:47	Espyo	like I said
2014-01-06 03:39:48	Espyo	but
2014-01-06 03:39:56	Espyo	this happens in an emulator
2014-01-06 03:40:05	Espyo	and as you're doing this, the emulator is recording everything
2014-01-06 03:40:13	@PikFan	I see
2014-01-06 03:40:22	Espyo	at 32 seconds and 14 frames, the guy presses A, at 32'15 he releases A presses right, etc.
2014-01-06 03:40:33	Espyo	and at the end, the emulator plays back these button presses in real time
2014-01-06 03:40:42	Espyo	emulator, or real console, like they did
2014-01-06 03:40:53	@PikFan	wow
2014-01-06 03:40:57	Espyo	to sum up, in an emulator, they used tools to create a perfect combination of button presses
2014-01-06 03:41:03	Espyo	then fed those button presses into a physical game
2014-01-06 03:41:10	Espyo	and those button presses abuse glitches that reprogram the game
2014-01-06 03:41:15	Espyo	a LOT goes on inside
2014-01-06 03:41:23	@PikFan	I'll bet
2014-01-06 03:41:25	Espyo	that's why I say, /never/ understimate the players
2014-01-06 03:41:47	Espyo	TASes of Pikmin games should be coming soon, as well
2014-01-06 03:41:50	@PikFan	and this was done on SNES with SMW?
2014-01-06 03:41:55	Espyo	Pikmin 3 is still too far in the distance
2014-01-06 03:41:59	Espyo	THAT reprogramming run, yes
2014-01-06 03:42:06	Espyo	but most other runs are just completing the game perfectly
2014-01-06 03:42:13	Espyo	this run went out of its way to do the reprogramming thing
2014-01-06 03:42:26	Espyo	anyway, a lot of GameCube and Wii games have been TASed already
2014-01-06 03:42:33	Espyo	people are always having fun TASing Super Mario Sunshine
2014-01-06 03:42:34	@PikFan	I wonder what Nintendo has to say about their games having TASes
2014-01-06 03:42:38	Espyo	and Brawl is also popularly TASes
2014-01-06 03:42:41	Espyo	it turns a blind eye
2014-01-06 03:42:46	Espyo	...for now
2014-01-06 03:42:59	@PikFan	you mean, Nintendo might stop it?
2014-01-06 03:43:05	Espyo	yes
2014-01-06 03:43:08	Espyo	unlikely, tough
2014-01-06 03:43:09	Espyo	*though
2014-01-06 03:43:15	Espyo	'cause if they wanted to, they'd have done it by now
2014-01-06 03:43:35	@PikFan	unless if Nintendo was like Sony and didn't want anybody touching their games
2014-01-06 03:43:40	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-06 03:43:44	Espyo	they don't still
2014-01-06 03:43:50	Espyo	but fans found ways to overcome it
2014-01-06 03:44:06	Espyo	didn't really help Nintendo's case that Twilight Princess contained live documentation on how the GameCube worked >_>
2014-01-06 03:44:16	@PikFan	inb4 fans get arrested
2014-01-06 03:44:19	@PikFan	jk
2014-01-06 03:44:20	Espyo	it's like they secretly wanted hackers to explore the console and make emulators
2014-01-06 03:44:22	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-06 03:44:28	Espyo	hope we don't get to that point
2014-01-06 03:44:33	Espyo	Nintendo's going nuts lately and all...
2014-01-06 03:44:38	Espyo	anyway, the speed in Pikmin games comes mostly from the strategy taken, and not so much the player's reflexes and perfect aiming
2014-01-06 03:44:45	Espyo	but even still, a Pikmin TAS would still be great
2014-01-06 03:44:46	@PikFan	right
2014-01-06 03:44:52	Espyo	imagine this
2014-01-06 03:44:56	Espyo	a Dwarf at a distance
2014-01-06 03:44:58	Espyo	you do a running throw
2014-01-06 03:45:02	Espyo	with no aiming
2014-01-06 03:45:03	Espyo	bam
2014-01-06 03:45:06	Espyo	perfect hit on the back
2014-01-06 03:45:09	@PikFan	wow
2014-01-06 03:45:14	Espyo	normal players have to carefully align the crosshair
2014-01-06 03:45:25	@PikFan	the problem is
2014-01-06 03:45:27	Espyo	in a TAS, you keep going back in time until you get a wild shot that just hits
2014-01-06 03:45:46	@PikFan	the game randomly generates so many things
2014-01-06 03:45:50	Espyo	oh, and throwing 15 Pikmin per second
2014-01-06 03:45:54	Espyo	that's another thing though
2014-01-06 03:45:57	Espyo	they can cheat luck as well
2014-01-06 03:46:06	Espyo	keep going back and time until something different happens
2014-01-06 03:46:17	Espyo	believe it or not, the randomness is ALSO saved in the button presses
2014-01-06 03:46:21	Espyo	this actually gets interesting
2014-01-06 03:46:30	Espyo	you know how Testyo always starts his first message with *>_>?
2014-01-06 03:46:36	@PikFan	yes?
2014-01-06 03:46:42	Espyo	I keep saying it's because his randomizer sucks, and it's true
2014-01-06 03:46:50	Espyo	"random" doesn't really exist in software
2014-01-06 03:46:59	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-06 03:47:03	Espyo	you just have a randomizer function that does random stuff, but first, it needs to be fed something
2014-01-06 03:47:07	Espyo	that's what makes it truly random
2014-01-06 03:47:08	Espyo	and...
2014-01-06 03:47:20	Espyo	for some reason, what I feed Testyo's randomizer (the time of day when he turns on) isn't enough
2014-01-06 03:47:26	Espyo	so he keeps generating the same *>_> every time
2014-01-06 03:47:38	Espyo	in games, what you feed the randomizer is normally the button presses
2014-01-06 03:47:56	Espyo	so with a TAS, which is all button-pressing combinations that are saved, using the going back in time and slowdown tools
2014-01-06 03:48:02	Espyo	the randomness can also be controlled
2014-01-06 03:48:10	Espyo	the player can know exactly what's going to happen
2014-01-06 03:48:13	Espyo	and manipulate randomness
2014-01-06 03:48:29	Espyo	so for the likes of Pikmin 2... always getting the smallest cave sublevels possible...
2014-01-06 03:48:40	Espyo	(oh, the thing I'm doing on the wiki would help tremendously with that!)
2014-01-06 03:48:57	Espyo	also getting the Titan Dweevil to always use the Shock Therapist, with no problem
2014-01-06 03:48:58	@PikFan	yeah, I was thinking about that
2014-01-06 03:49:07	Espyo	almost everything can be manipulated
2014-01-06 03:49:16	Espyo	nevertheless, the GameCube is a very complex machine
2014-01-06 03:49:19	@PikFan	huh, didn't Miles beat the TD in 50 seconds
2014-01-06 03:49:19	Espyo	a LOT more than a mere SNES
2014-01-06 03:49:26	Espyo	maybe, I believe
2014-01-06 03:49:28	Espyo	well, imagine less
2014-01-06 03:49:38	Espyo	faster Pikmin throwing, faster than a human can manage (because slowdown)
2014-01-06 03:49:42	@PikFan	but with TAS, how fast you could beat it
2014-01-06 03:49:47	Espyo	perfect luck with the Shock Therapist's projectiles
2014-01-06 03:49:50	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-06 03:49:54	Espyo	I'd estimate 40 seconds
2014-01-06 03:49:57	Espyo	if Miles really did do 50
2014-01-06 03:50:23	Espyo	what's the current Pikmin 2 time?
2014-01-06 03:50:30	@PikFan	hmm, let me check
2014-01-06 03:50:35	Espyo	 3:10
2014-01-06 03:50:45	Espyo	a TAS would probably beat the game in 2:40
2014-01-06 03:50:46	Espyo	no doubt
2014-01-06 03:50:50	Espyo	around that time
2014-01-06 03:50:56	Espyo	a LOT of tiny details would be optimized
2014-01-06 03:51:03	Espyo	tinier than what a human can manage
2014-01-06 03:51:08	Espyo	Miles happens to be a human, you see
2014-01-06 03:51:28	Espyo	insanely fast and precise button presses, control over randomness, no mistakes, optimizations...
2014-01-06 03:51:36	Espyo	add into that new tricks that have been found since the last run
2014-01-06 03:51:39	Espyo	and I think 2:40 would work
2014-01-06 03:51:59	Espyo	though, we're still a bit far from achieving reliable GameCube emulation, and hence, TAS
2014-01-06 03:52:15	Espyo	someone could try, but the biggest problem at the moment lies in loading
2014-01-06 03:52:22	Espyo	you know the loading screens that tell you the area name?
2014-01-06 03:52:27	Espyo	yeah, loading doesn't exist in emulators
2014-01-06 03:52:34	Espyo	it's instant
2014-01-06 03:52:50	Espyo	so there has to be fake loading in order to at least make the game attempt to behave like a real GameCube
2014-01-06 03:53:08	Espyo	also weirdly enough, Pikmin 2 is kinda finicky on whether it wants to start or not >_>
2014-01-06 03:53:16	Espyo	for me and a few people, it only starts once every 30 tries
2014-01-06 03:53:27	Espyo	you gotta keep resetting, it keeps getting stuck on the Nintendo screen
2014-01-06 03:53:32	Espyo	just further proof that they're not quite there yet
2014-01-06 03:53:49	Espyo	but don't worry, within the next 3 or so years, if all goes well, we'll see Pikmin and Pikmin 2 beaten with super-human skills and control
2014-01-06 03:54:00	Espyo	that still won't drive away traditional speedrunning; it never did
2014-01-06 03:54:08	Espyo	traditional speedruns are a display of pure human skill
2014-01-06 03:54:22	Espyo	TAS is a display of investigation and attempts
2014-01-06 03:54:34	Espyo	tasvideos.org
2014-01-06 03:54:40	@PikFan	ok, so Miles beat the TD in 1:15, according to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbPhdU_soK8
2014-01-06 03:54:46	@PikFan	I was off by 25 seconds
2014-01-06 03:54:47	Espyo	they have like over 500 TAS of SNES, Genesis et al games
2014-01-06 03:54:55	Espyo	oh
2014-01-06 03:55:10	@PikFan	(I guess I was hoping for Miles to beat it faster)
2014-01-06 03:55:11	Espyo	well, in that case, 1:00 seems like a fair time for a RUN to defeat the Titan Dweevil
2014-01-06 03:55:15	Espyo	maybe 1:05
2014-01-06 03:55:33	Espyo	does the Titan Dweevil always use the Shock Therapist?
2014-01-06 03:55:38	Espyo	because if not, time can be shaven there then
2014-01-06 03:55:48	Espyo	anyway, going to bed now
2014-01-06 03:55:53	@PikFan	good night

2014-01-06 23:53:41	@PikFan	I still have to finish up some types though
2014-01-06 23:59:18	Prez	I'll start editing in an hour or so, is there something I can look up that you haven't noted down yet, Pikfan?
2014-01-06 23:59:34	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2014-01-06 23:59:49	@PikFan	well
2014-01-07 00:00:14	@PikFan	can you check Brittany's notes on the fruit and see if they're any different from the ones I put up?
2014-01-07 00:00:53	Espyo	ah, version differences?
2014-01-07 00:00:54	Espyo	good call
2014-01-07 00:01:18	@PikFan	because I was looking around wikia's fruit pages and saw different notes

2014-01-07 00:10:07	@PikFan	gah, I don't get why people can't call me "PikFan"
2014-01-07 00:10:22	Espyo	what do you mean, PikminFan?
2014-01-07 00:10:41	@PikFan	no, like

2014-01-07 00:11:00	@PikFan	(which is my username)
2014-01-07 00:11:01	Espyo	oh, heh
2014-01-07 00:11:19	@PikFan	but it'd be nice if they could just call me "PikFan" once in a while
2014-01-07 00:11:26	Espyo	well, it's the name of your user account, so there's no more official name than that
2014-01-07 00:11:32	@PikFan	...I don't know why I'm obsessed over it
2014-01-07 00:11:37	@PikFan	yeah

2014-01-07 00:22:23	Espyo	in that case
2014-01-07 00:22:34	@PikFan	do I just go into one of the MediaWiki pages and change a file or something
2014-01-07 00:22:35	Espyo	the massive background picture should be downscaled
2014-01-07 00:22:47	Espyo	web browsers gag whenever they have to handle the background image
2014-01-07 00:22:53	Espyo	I'm not sure
2014-01-07 00:23:20	Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/File:Green-grass_w.jpg

2014-01-07 00:23:36	@PikFan	well, there was another background image, but another admin changed it because it made the edges white on laptops
2014-01-07 00:23:41	Espyo	way more than any screen needs
2014-01-07 00:24:31	Espyo	in fact, I think only a fraction of the image ever shows anyway
2014-01-07 00:28:15	@PikFan	hah, TVtrash is stirring up trouble in #mariowiki
2014-01-07 00:28:27	@PikFan	16:27	TVTrash	why does everyone hate me??
2014-01-07 00:28:31	@PikFan	what an idiot
2014-01-07 00:28:56	Espyo	heh
2014-01-07 00:32:06	Espyo	:/
2014-01-07 00:32:09	Espyo	well, that broke the CSS
2014-01-07 00:33:59	@PikFan	uh
2014-01-07 00:34:04	Espyo	don't panic!
2014-01-07 00:34:06	@PikFan	what do you want me to do?
2014-01-07 00:34:06	Espyo	first and foremost
2014-01-07 00:34:09	Espyo	secondly
2014-01-07 00:34:09	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Common.css
2014-01-07 00:34:11	Espyo	download this
2014-01-07 00:34:21	Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&action=edit go here
2014-01-07 00:34:26	Espyo	and replace the content with the file I wrote
2014-01-07 00:34:31	Espyo	and everything should be fine
2014-01-07 00:35:35	@PikFan	mm ok
2014-01-07 00:35:38	@PikFan	is it fixed?
2014-01-07 00:35:48	Espyo	ok, that didn't seem to have worked
2014-01-07 00:35:54	@PikFan	:|
2014-01-07 00:36:08	@PikFan	J, help — oh, he's asleep
2014-01-07 00:37:24	Espyo	don't worry
2014-01-07 00:40:38	@PikFan	aaaaagh
2014-01-07 00:40:41	@PikFan	it's blinding
2014-01-07 00:41:10	Espyo	hang on, almost got it
2014-01-07 00:41:16	Espyo	revert your change to Common.css
2014-01-07 00:42:32	Espyo	http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Monobook.css&action=edit go here, and replace with https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Monobook.css
2014-01-07 00:42:39	Espyo	and THAT should work
2014-01-07 00:44:10	Espyo	wait
2014-01-07 00:44:31	@PikFan	ugh, I feel like you're dragging me places
2014-01-07 00:44:43	Espyo	this should be easier than it is
2014-01-07 00:44:49	Espyo	it's not acting exactly like it should
2014-01-07 00:45:55	Espyo	ok, check my Dropbox file again
2014-01-07 00:46:05	Espyo	make sure line 47 is body{background-size: 100% auto;}
2014-01-07 00:46:23	Espyo	and if so, THEN you replace Monobook.css on fanon
2014-01-07 00:46:33	Espyo	and if this doesn't work, we'll revert and we'll try tomorrow, with more control
2014-01-07 00:46:36	Espyo	but this should really work now
2014-01-07 00:47:26	@PikFan	yes, it's correct
2014-01-07 00:47:31	Espyo	ok, go
2014-01-07 00:47:54	@PikFan	*crosses fingers*
2014-01-07 00:48:00	Espyo	DAMMIT
2014-01-07 00:48:03	@PikFan	:|
2014-01-07 00:48:21	@PikFan	now you made the WHOLE background white ._.
2014-01-07 00:48:42	Espyo	how did it even
2014-01-07 00:48:57	Espyo	ok, I'm obviously going to need a) a fresher brain, b) not studying physics and c) J for this
2014-01-07 00:49:06	Espyo	revert Monobook.css please... ugh
2014-01-07 00:49:34	@PikFan	doesn't Prez have some experience though
2014-01-07 00:50:01	Espyo	not sure
2014-01-07 00:50:17	@PikFan	honestly, what are you doing?
2014-01-07 00:50:56	Espyo	 00:22	Espyo	the massive background picture should be downscaled
2014-01-07 00:51:06	Espyo	I did it, but the style rules made it look bad
2014-01-07 00:51:10	Espyo	so I tried some simple rules to fix it
2014-01-07 00:51:17	Espyo	but oh, guess what, "simple" doesn't exist in the world of CSS
2014-01-07 00:51:19	@PikFan	which made it worse
2014-01-07 00:51:26	Espyo	it's ok, reverting will fix it all
2014-01-07 00:51:52	Espyo	did you revert the change on MediaWiki:Monobook.css yet?
2014-01-07 00:53:12	Espyo	and we're back to normal
2014-01-07 00:53:19	Espyo	and just like normal, it took the page 10 seconds to fully load
2014-01-07 00:53:26	Espyo	I'll still do the background thing tomorrow
2014-01-07 00:53:29	Espyo	but with better control
2014-01-07 00:53:35	Espyo	ugh, teaches me to dive head first into editing CSS
2014-01-07 00:53:36	@PikFan	mhm
2014-01-07 00:58:34	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-07 00:58:53	@PikFan	/maybe/ it'd work if you didn't drastically resize it
2014-01-07 01:03:31	Espyo	that's the whole point
2014-01-07 01:03:41	Espyo	to resize it so that the browser doesn't take ages to work with it
2014-01-07 01:03:54	Espyo	also, only the center of the image was being shown
2014-01-07 01:03:59	Espyo	so a LOT of the image wasn't even being used

2014-01-07 02:48:21	@PikFan	and you can't zoom in or out
2014-01-07 02:48:32	@PikFan	and Blue Pikmin don't rescue drowning Pikmin
2014-01-07 02:49:10	ThePikminMeister	I know
2014-01-07 02:49:44	@PikFan	Pikmin 3 clearly had a different development team than 1 and 2
2014-01-07 02:49:50	ThePikminMeister	I know
2014-01-07 02:50:07	ThePikminMeister	I made the archive!

2014-01-08 18:38:06	@J	.
2014-01-08 18:38:40	Espyo	hey
2014-01-08 18:39:21	@J	need to come up with a few quick arenas for that Ludum Dare game
2014-01-08 18:39:25	@J	just so there's stuff in it
2014-01-08 18:39:26	@J	ideas?
2014-01-08 18:40:28	Espyo	the shooter? or the one you mad for LD 28?
2014-01-08 18:40:55	Espyo	*made
2014-01-08 18:41:02	@J	LD28, the mines one
2014-01-08 18:41:29	@J	I'll let you do my work for me while I eat
2014-01-08 18:41:33	Espyo	hmm, I have no particular idea
2014-01-08 18:41:37	Espyo	but making them bigger is a must
2014-01-08 18:41:49	Espyo	the camera would be a problem, thouh...
2014-01-08 18:42:33	Espyo	aww, you were almost #1000 in coolness
2014-01-08 18:42:36	Espyo	whatever coolness is
2014-01-08 18:45:20	@J	oh, it finished?
2014-01-08 18:45:29	@J	I probably didn't do very well
2014-01-08 18:45:40	@J	yeah, I made the window a bit bigger
2014-01-08 18:45:48	@J	not going to bother with scrolling, just a larger static size
2014-01-08 18:46:29	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-08 18:46:41	Espyo	hm, an arena that focuses on tunnels could work nicely
2014-01-08 18:47:08	Espyo	one player can force the other into going through a certain tunnel
2014-01-08 18:47:15	Espyo	where they have no way of jumping over a mine
2014-01-08 18:48:08	Espyo	also, why is my coolness a percentage, not a ranking?
2014-01-08 18:48:32	@J	coolness is how many games you rate
2014-01-08 18:48:41	@J	apparently above 50 gets you some sort of medal
2014-01-08 18:48:51	@J	it's also not a %, it's just the number
2014-01-08 18:48:55	@J	you rated 52 games
2014-01-08 18:49:37	Espyo	impossible
2014-01-08 18:49:42	Espyo	I rated 20 something
2014-01-08 18:49:49	@J	hmm
2014-01-08 18:49:57	@J	well maybe it's a little altered or something
2014-01-08 18:50:04	@J	maybe it's doubled
2014-01-08 18:50:25	Espyo	yeah, 26 sounds about right
2014-01-08 18:50:29	Espyo	but the percentage sign...
2014-01-08 18:51:12	@J	I think they double then cap it to 100?
2014-01-08 18:51:15	@J	I don't know
2014-01-08 18:51:39	@J	anyway, I do find it quite interesting how a game's overall impression on the player tends to influence the category ratings
2014-01-08 18:52:01	@J	as in, a game a player didn't really find fun but had great graphics will get much lower graphics scores than other fun games with similar graphics
2014-01-08 18:52:15	@J	there are obviously exceptions, but I think there's a pretty clear trend
2014-01-08 18:53:43	Espyo	hmmm
2014-01-08 18:53:51	Espyo	I tried not to do that on my ratings
2014-01-08 18:54:08	Espyo	if I found a horrible game, I'd give the overall a low score, but I'd still attempt to objectively judge the graphics and audio and such
2014-01-08 18:54:25	@J	yeah, I'm talking about raters averaged, not individual raters
2014-01-08 18:54:50	Espyo	hm
2014-01-08 18:54:52	Espyo	right
2014-01-08 18:55:41	@J	http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=741
2014-01-08 18:55:43	@J	for example, this
2014-01-08 18:55:56	@J	people found it fun and new, so the graphics score is higher than both of our games
2014-01-08 18:56:07	@J	audio higher than mine
2014-01-08 18:56:29	Espyo	mine has a higher graphics score
2014-01-08 18:56:48	Espyo	but yeah, I see what you mean
2014-01-08 18:56:55	Espyo	though for that case, it could just be a case of loving pixel-art
2014-01-08 18:57:06	@J	whaaaaaa
2014-01-08 18:57:07	Espyo	you and me didn't really do pixel art, but our art didn't look majestic
2014-01-08 18:57:09	Espyo	so it fell flat
2014-01-08 18:57:16	@J	yours has a higher graphics score, but lower ranking
2014-01-08 18:57:26	@J	oh, jam
2014-01-08 18:57:29	@J	okay, never mind
2014-01-08 18:57:29	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-08 18:57:39	Espyo	also his coolness is 0%...
2014-01-08 18:57:49	Espyo	isn't the coolness the ratio between comments received and games rated?
2014-01-08 18:57:53	@J	probably shouldn't be comparing jam games
2014-01-08 18:57:58	@J	no, just games rated
2014-01-08 18:58:01	Espyo	or the other way around
2014-01-08 18:58:05	Espyo	but the percentage sign!...
2014-01-08 18:58:06	@J	that was the 'D' on the ratings page
2014-01-08 18:58:10	Espyo	I still find something so odd about it
2014-01-08 18:58:12	Espyo	yeah, the D
2014-01-08 18:58:35	@J	this guy got lots of comments anyway because he knows lots of developers
2014-01-08 18:58:57	Espyo	right
2014-01-08 19:02:14	@J	but yeah, anyway, maybe next time I'll come up with a decent idea
2014-01-08 19:02:38	@J	it was still fun
2014-01-08 19:02:44	@J	(making it)
2014-01-08 19:03:11	@J	hmm, you kind of did pixel art
2014-01-08 19:03:17	@J	it's certainly low-res
2014-01-08 19:06:08	Espyo	well, it was made in Inkscape
2014-01-08 19:06:10	Espyo	so it's not pixel art
2014-01-08 19:06:17	Espyo	pixel art is where you do the pixels individually and such
2014-01-08 19:06:21	Espyo	this is really far from it
2014-01-08 19:11:40	@J	hmm, I guess
2014-01-08 19:11:47	@J	but it looks like it could be pixel art
2014-01-08 19:11:53	@J	which makes it almost pixel art
2014-01-08 19:14:39	Espyo	almost
2014-01-08 19:15:03	Espyo	have you ever been to Pikmin fanon?
2014-01-08 19:15:06	Espyo	well, you probably have
2014-01-08 19:15:12	@J	...yes
2014-01-08 19:15:12	Espyo	the background takes ages to load
2014-01-08 19:15:16	@J	yeah
2014-01-08 19:15:20	Espyo	and if I tab out and back in, it flickers for a second
2014-01-08 19:15:22	@J	that huge jpeg of leaves?
2014-01-08 19:15:27	@J	grass
2014-01-08 19:15:28	Espyo	that's because it's 3K x 1.5K pixels
2014-01-08 19:15:28	Testyo	3 K = -270.15 °C / -4830.7 °F
2014-01-08 19:15:30	Espyo	grass
2014-01-08 19:15:32	Espyo	I tried reducing it
2014-01-08 19:15:36	Espyo	but that required editing the CSS
2014-01-08 19:15:39	Espyo	all fine and dandy, except
2014-01-08 19:15:44	Espyo	the day CSS cooperates, the world will end
2014-01-08 19:15:53	@J	how can you reduce it with CSS?
2014-01-08 19:16:00	Espyo	no, I reduced the actual image
2014-01-08 19:16:05	Espyo	but the CSS also needed fixing
2014-01-08 19:16:15	Espyo	so when/if PikFan joins the IRC today, would you mind helping us out?
2014-01-08 19:16:34	Espyo	it /really/ shouldn't be hard, but after what happened two days ago, I would at least like to have someone else to be blamed with me
2014-01-08 19:18:12	@J	were you reducing quality, cropping, scaling?
2014-01-08 19:19:47	Espyo	scaling
2014-01-08 19:19:56	Espyo	and reducing quality
2014-01-08 19:19:59	@J	just lowering quality works fairly well
2014-01-08 19:20:02	Espyo	from 3MB, I think, to 100KB
2014-01-08 19:20:11	@J	75% quality gives 800KiB
2014-01-08 19:20:14	Espyo	still, as it is, only like the central 10% of the image shows
2014-01-08 19:20:18	Espyo	so it's a bit wasteful
2014-01-08 19:20:29	@J	well, I guess if you have a huge monitor...
2014-01-08 19:20:30	Espyo	that's pretty good
2014-01-08 19:20:36	@J	2000px wide is reasonable
2014-01-08 19:20:40	@J	http://i.imgur.com/xoc8A1L.jpg
2014-01-08 19:20:43	@J	doesn't look bad either
2014-01-08 19:21:23	Espyo	yeah, looks good, but I still think it's a bit wasteful
2014-01-08 19:21:29	@J	yeah, probably
2014-01-08 19:21:54	Espyo	anyway, as it is right now, it's fullsize, and centered
2014-01-08 19:22:04	Espyo	the idea was to downscale it, and then have the CSS scale it to fit the screen
2014-01-08 19:22:10	Espyo	but apparently, that's just fiction
2014-01-08 19:22:20	@J	uh...imgur seems to have compressed it further
2014-01-08 19:22:33	@J	or maybe I changed it while uploading
2014-01-08 19:22:44	@J	hmm, yeah, that sounds crazy
2014-01-08 19:23:38	@J	...no, it just changes it
2014-01-08 19:24:07	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grass.jpg
2014-01-08 19:24:11	@J	that's the actual 75% quality one
2014-01-08 19:24:31	Espyo	hm
2014-01-08 19:24:36	@J	but yeah, could probably get away with 2000x1200
2014-01-08 19:24:57	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-08 19:25:06	@J	I would suggest tiling it just on the off-chance someone sees outside it
2014-01-08 19:26:32	@J	that's 268k
2014-01-08 19:26:32	Testyo	268 K = -5.15 °C / -60.7 °F
2014-01-08 19:26:44	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grass.jpg
2014-01-08 19:27:00	Espyo	I don't think it's tileable
2014-01-08 19:27:38	@J	no, it's not
2014-01-08 19:27:39	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grass-tileable.jpg
2014-01-08 19:27:40	@J	this is
2014-01-08 19:27:59	@J	it looks...interesting
2014-01-08 19:28:35	@J	but even if it's not tileable, tiling it is better than having a white strip outside it
2014-01-08 19:29:24	Espyo	...huh
2014-01-08 19:29:32	Espyo	it is better, but
2014-01-08 19:29:46	Espyo	how did you manage that? it does look pretty nice
2014-01-08 19:32:06	@J	GIMP plugin

2014-01-08 19:32:55	Espyo	and how did you manage that giant resolution?

2014-01-08 19:37:32	@J	the 'Resynthesize...' you see in that screenshot removes objects from the image
2014-01-08 19:38:00	@J	and also generates images that look like the original, but with everything moved around
2014-01-08 19:38:09	@J	good for making a natual extension of a pattern
2014-01-08 19:38:35	Espyo	"objects"?

2014-01-08 19:44:41	Espyo	instead of the game creating the cave using units picked at random, organized at random, following some rules
2014-01-08 19:44:53	Espyo	the 2P stages use a static list that tells it where everything goes

2014-01-09 15:30:13	@PikFan	so the average is between 40 to 50 days
2014-01-09 15:30:31	Espyo	well, that's for all players
2014-01-09 15:30:33	Espyo	not skilled
2014-01-09 15:30:48	@PikFan	it drops down sharply before 40 days

2014-01-09 20:35:23	Espyo	...why?
2014-01-09 20:36:01	@J	because I don't use as much energy as they expected

2014-01-09 20:41:02	Espyo	a company of this sort being so nice?
2014-01-09 20:41:14	Espyo	either I'm just used to everything being greedy and expensive over here, or something's afoot
2014-01-09 20:56:24	@J	well, I can take my own meter readings any time I want
2014-01-09 20:56:33	@J	and my contract states a fixed price per unit
2014-01-09 20:56:42	@J	so they can't really do otherwise or someone would notice

2014-01-10 00:06:09	@PikFan	maybe it's because I haven't left the wrinklers for long periods of time

2014-01-10 00:32:05	Espyo	so I couldn't confirm if that one was Miles
2014-01-10 00:32:15	Espyo	but anyway, something about doing something in an alternate way to what Miles came up with or something
2014-01-10 00:36:29	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-01-10 00:36:49	Espyo	the runner that's playing at the moment said something to Miles

2014-01-10 19:43:49	@J	I did 11 catches of a 5-ball cascade today
2014-01-10 19:43:51	@J	it was amazing
2014-01-10 19:45:45	Espyo	that doesn't really sound like a juggling term
2014-01-10 19:45:55	Espyo	mostly the "cascade" part, really
2014-01-10 19:46:03	Espyo	sounds more like you let some balls fall down the stairs and had to catch them
2014-01-10 19:46:07	Espyo	...brb, inventing a new fun game
2014-01-10 19:46:22	Espyo	drat, I don't have stairs in my house
2014-01-10 19:52:50	@J	cascade is the normal juggling
2014-01-10 19:53:01	@J	where you throw on the inside and catch on the outside
2014-01-10 19:53:18	Espyo	oh
2014-01-10 19:53:19	@J	game that requires stairs is poor without stairs
2014-01-10 19:53:39	Espyo	I learned that the hard way
2014-01-10 19:54:07	@J	I like how you went off to try it even though you knew you had no stairs, though
2014-01-10 19:54:31	Espyo	before getting off my chair, I thought about the details
2014-01-10 19:54:39	Espyo	also I realized you need another person on the top to release the balls
2014-01-10 19:54:45	Espyo	either that or a pulley system
2014-01-10 19:55:44	Espyo	is there any way to represent absolute/relative numbers that's widely known?
2014-01-10 19:58:34	@J	?
2014-01-10 19:58:46	Espyo	ok, on the engine
2014-01-10 19:59:07	Espyo	the game maker can either make the enemy move 34, 56
2014-01-10 19:59:11	Espyo	but that can either be absolute or relative
2014-01-10 19:59:21	@J	moveTo, moveBy
2014-01-10 19:59:22	@J	?
2014-01-10 19:59:30	Espyo	I meant more in the actual numbers
2014-01-10 19:59:39	Espyo	&34, &56
2014-01-10 19:59:46	@J	you mean like in a config file?
2014-01-10 19:59:49	Espyo	...no, but for some reason that came to my head
2014-01-10 19:59:59	Espyo	in a config file, yeah
2014-01-10 20:00:12	Espyo	#34, #56
2014-01-10 20:00:14	Espyo	no...
2014-01-10 20:00:21	Espyo	@34, @56 for absolute?
2014-01-10 20:00:26	@J	not that I know of
2014-01-10 20:00:36	Espyo	I know Minecraft does ~34, ~56
2014-01-10 20:00:37	@J	I mean, I haven't heard of any such conventions
2014-01-10 20:00:38	Espyo	for relative
2014-01-10 20:00:49	Espyo	I figured, they probably don't exist
2014-01-10 20:01:12	Espyo	+/- doesn't work
2014-01-10 20:01:15	@J	I would suggest +/- if-
2014-01-10 20:01:15	@J	yeah
2014-01-10 20:01:20	Espyo	yup
2014-01-10 20:02:08	@J	why not O, for origin?
2014-01-10 20:02:16	@J	relative is O+124, O-325
2014-01-10 20:02:20	@J	I don't know
2014-01-10 20:02:23	Espyo	hm
2014-01-10 20:02:34	Espyo	I'd rather not involve letters into the mix
2014-01-10 20:02:46	Espyo	I could always do moveby and moveto
2014-01-10 20:03:06	Espyo	but having just move, and have the numbers decide absolutism or relativity would be better
2014-01-10 20:03:10	@J	not sure what exactly we're looking at here, but
2014-01-10 20:03:15	@J	move = 5, 4 rel
2014-01-10 20:03:21	@J	move = 5, 4 abs
2014-01-10 20:03:23	Espyo	that could work
2014-01-10 20:03:42	Espyo	otoh, I'd like something that would be specific to either relative or absolute
2014-01-10 20:03:49	@J	move = to 5, 4
2014-01-10 20:03:50	Espyo	so that not specifying anything would default to something
2014-01-10 20:03:52	@J	move = by 5, 4
2014-01-10 20:04:11	Espyo	moveto = 5, 4 would probably be better
2014-01-10 20:04:17	Espyo	guess I might go with that
2014-01-10 20:04:29	Espyo	though it is a bit soon, I'm only going to start the whole system now
2014-01-10 20:04:36	Espyo	on that note, I figured events are really the only way to go
2014-01-10 20:04:40	Espyo	it would never work with states
2014-01-10 20:04:56	Espyo	on see Pikmin, on lose Pikmin, on contact with Pikmin, on take damage, ...
2014-01-10 20:20:04	Espyo	well
2014-01-10 20:20:16	Espyo	Pikmin and Pikmin 2 have a lot of varied enemies, that do a lot of things
2014-01-10 20:20:39	Espyo	but I managed to figure out all the necessary events and actions to create the behavior of all of the original enemies
2014-01-10 20:20:43	Espyo	...except one
2014-01-10 20:20:47	Espyo	of ALL wacky enemies
2014-01-10 20:21:01	Espyo	the Spotted Jellyfloats will probably require special coding
2014-01-10 20:21:14	Espyo	because they eat Pikmin every X seconds, picked at random from the ones they gulped down
2014-01-10 20:21:34	Espyo	I'll have to create a system that stores a list of Pikmin inside the stomach, and a way to randomly pick and kill one
2014-01-10 20:21:44	Espyo	anything else any enemy can do can be represented with the list of events and actions I have
2014-01-10 20:21:52	Espyo	but not that, of all things
2014-01-10 20:22:03	Espyo	I figured I'd come up with like 5 things, all from bosses
2014-01-10 20:22:07	Espyo	but I never expected this

2014-01-10 21:10:50	@J	all the actions have to be implemented in code anyway, right?
2014-01-10 21:10:55	@J	eating, shaking, etc.
2014-01-10 21:11:18	@J	so why can't you just specify an event that's called every X seconds, which runs the 'eat a Pikmin' action

2014-01-10 21:11:39	PikFan	ok so
2014-01-10 21:11:42	Espyo	not quite quite
2014-01-10 21:11:45	Espyo	hey PikFan
2014-01-10 21:11:48	PikFan	I forgot to mention this yesterday
2014-01-10 21:12:00	@J	hey
2014-01-10 21:12:03	PikFan	but Peach Bulborb expanded the Scornet Maestro strategy
2014-01-10 21:12:05	PikFan	hi J
2014-01-10 21:12:30	PikFan	I think he doesn't quite know how to write good strategies
2014-01-10 21:12:58	PikFan	'cause he uses "you" a lot, sometimes doesn't capitalize Pikmin, etc
2014-01-10 21:13:05	Espyo	it'll need a rewrite then
2014-01-10 21:13:12	@J	[21:11:42] Espyo not quite quite
2014-01-10 21:13:13	@J	?
2014-01-10 21:13:21	Espyo	just point him out that "Pikmin" should be capitalized
2014-01-10 21:13:24	@J	PikFan: but as long as the information is there, others can rewrite it
2014-01-10 21:13:29	Espyo	as for "you", we still haven't reached a consensus, have we?
2014-01-10 21:13:37	@J	yeah, forever ago
2014-01-10 21:13:37	Espyo	yeah, it's more important for the info to be there
2014-01-10 21:13:38	PikFan	?
2014-01-10 21:13:44	Espyo	making it pretty is less important
2014-01-10 21:13:48	PikFan	yeah
2014-01-10 21:14:06	Espyo	ok, let's see, for a Dwarf Bulborb
2014-01-10 21:14:13	PikFan	anyway
2014-01-10 21:14:14	Espyo	when the near Pikmin event hit
2014-01-10 21:14:22	PikFan	what were you talking about before I got on
2014-01-10 21:14:24	Espyo	it changes animation the the chomping animation
2014-01-10 21:14:35	Espyo	it's the animation that has hitboxes responsible for killing what it touches
2014-01-10 21:14:43	Espyo	PikFan: my engine
2014-01-10 21:14:46	PikFan	...the the chomping animation?
2014-01-10 21:14:49	Espyo	finally gonna continue working on it
2014-01-10 21:14:58	Espyo	yeah, the animation in which it lunges to take a bite
2014-01-10 21:15:00	PikFan	oh, yay
2014-01-10 21:16:30	PikFan	hmm
2014-01-10 21:16:38	PikFan	I should start making the area articles
2014-01-10 21:16:54	PikFan	also I was disappointed that P3 didn't have more areas
2014-01-10 21:17:13	PikFan	6, 7 areas would have been nice
2014-01-10 21:17:36	Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-01-10 21:17:42	Espyo	I think I'll go for 5 areas on my game
2014-01-10 21:18:00	PikFan	my game has 8 areas
2014-01-10 21:18:30	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-10 21:18:42	PikFan	let's see...
2014-01-10 21:18:50	PikFan	there are what, 20+ caves?
2014-01-10 21:19:20	PikFan	well over twice the length of P2
2014-01-10 21:20:00	Espyo	uh...
2014-01-10 21:20:05	Espyo	P2 has 12 caves
2014-01-10 21:20:17	Espyo	 20+ could be less, as many, or over twice
2014-01-10 21:20:36	PikFan	...and I have girls swarming over me

2014-01-10 22:20:59	Espyo	good to see visual studio is ready to effectively debug a windowed application with a console in the background
2014-01-10 22:21:10	Espyo	if you close the window, you will still have to close the console as well
2014-01-10 22:21:20	Espyo	and if you close the console while debugging, it'll report an assertion failure
2014-01-10 22:21:36	Espyo	of course, you don't know what this is, because in Linux there's always a console behind the running process
2014-01-10 22:28:17	@J	no, I know that when you build a Windows executable, it either always has a console or can't ever have one
2014-01-10 22:28:44	@J	it's really weirdly implemented
2014-01-10 22:28:56	@J	either the console is _embedded_ into the program, or it's not
2014-01-10 22:29:34	Espyo	yep
2014-01-10 22:29:58	@J	I would've thought, though, that if you hook the window close event up to process exit, the console should close too
2014-01-10 22:30:40	Espyo	it does, but it stays on the "press any key to continue..." part
2014-01-10 22:30:49	Espyo	now, this makes sense, because when debugging on a console program
2014-01-10 22:30:57	Espyo	you probably don't want the console to go away before you see the output
2014-01-10 22:31:04	Espyo	but that's not a problem for me, so why can't I disable it?
2014-01-10 22:31:05	Espyo	eesh
2014-01-10 22:36:18	@J	I assume VS will have added that
2014-01-10 22:36:22	@J	it doesn't occur normally
2014-01-10 22:36:33	Espyo	it doesn't, it's a VS thing
2014-01-10 22:36:39	Espyo	but it's annoying when I don't need to wait for the output
2014-01-10 22:37:28	Espyo	ah, just as it should
2014-01-10 22:37:46	Espyo	if Pikmin/2's enemy AI scripts work anywhere near the way I made mine work
2014-01-10 22:38:14	Espyo	then every time an enemy loses track of a Pikmin that's near a group, it'll call the "see Pikmin" and "lose Pikmin" events a few more times
2014-01-10 22:38:32	Espyo	it loses the Pikmin it was following, but it catches and loses other Pikmin on the group as they pass by
2014-01-10 22:40:25	Espyo	hmm, except you can't really tell

2014-01-11 20:58:05	@J	[01:27:07] Espyo Miles is doing the Metroid Prime run, AND they're interviewing Zoid, the senior

2014-01-11 20:58:08	@J	engineer?
2014-01-11 21:11:04	Espyo	it's what his title is
2014-01-11 21:34:46	@J	engineer of what?
2014-01-11 21:43:11	Espyo	well, yesterday, the person who pointed me out that called him the senior engineer
2014-01-11 21:43:18	Espyo	and earlier today I saw that term
2014-01-11 21:43:19	Espyo	so...
2014-01-11 21:45:47	@J	I'm just wondering why you would want to see an interview with this guy if you don't know what it means for him to be the senior engineer
2014-01-11 21:51:22	Espyo	I know what he means, though
2014-01-11 21:51:24	Espyo	he's like the main guy
2014-01-11 21:57:20	@J	hmm
2014-01-11 22:00:11	@J	I guess maybe it's a different Zoid the the Metroid Prime runner who retired a few years ago?
2014-01-11 22:00:31	@J	in which case, I'm surprised the name isn't familiar
2014-01-11 22:04:45	Espyo	that Zoid's nickname must come from the developer Zoid, I think

2014-01-12 12:49:20	Pikpikmate	A lot has happened I see
2014-01-12 12:49:43	Pikpikmate	What's up with these "Cave Units"?
2014-01-12 12:50:04	Espyo	simply put, imagine a Pikmin 2 cave is a puzzle
2014-01-12 12:50:09	Espyo	the game is given a set of pieces to work with
2014-01-12 12:50:17	Espyo	and is tasked to make a puzzle with those pieces, as randomly as it can
2014-01-12 12:50:18	Espyo	that's all
2014-01-12 12:50:31	Espyo	it's just a way for people to know what kind of geometry to expect on each sublevel

2014-01-12 12:51:49	Pikpikmate	So the design of the cave is absolutely random each time?
2014-01-12 12:53:13	Espyo	within the provided cave units, yep
2014-01-12 12:53:34	Espyo	and then some other rules, like it can only have a certain number of "rooms", a certain number of corridors and dead ends, etc.
2014-01-12 12:54:37	Pikpikmate	That's actually really cool
2014-01-12 12:55:20	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-12 12:55:23	Espyo	confusing as well
2014-01-12 12:55:25	Pikpikmate	That's so complex
2014-01-12 12:55:28	Espyo	the game's files are never consistent
2014-01-12 12:55:44	Espyo	most of the time, it says one sublevel has like "Chappy 20"
2014-01-12 12:55:49	Espyo	which means 2 Red Bulborbs
2014-01-12 12:55:55	Espyo	but other times those numbers make absolutely no sense
2014-01-12 12:56:27	Pikpikmate	So, ten years later we still don't completely understand how the game works?
2014-01-12 12:57:33	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-12 12:57:38	Espyo	and there are still more mysteries about
2014-01-12 12:59:50	Pikpikmate	People're still figurin out stuff about Final Fantasy VII, so that proves somethin
2014-01-12 13:00:36	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-12 13:01:43	Pikpikmate	Back to the primary topic, how was this information uncovered?
2014-01-12 13:02:34	Espyo	it was uncovered ages ago, but nobody documented it until now
2014-01-12 13:02:48	Espyo	also those who did find it probably only really browsed around
2014-01-12 13:02:59	Espyo	I actually checked every sublevel on every cave; I had to
2014-01-12 13:03:06	Espyo	though I did find some interesting things with it
2014-01-12 13:03:40	Espyo	like 3 caves having their last sublevel marked as having a clogged hole
2014-01-12 13:03:45	Espyo	even though the last sublevel never has a hole
2014-01-12 13:04:45	Pikpikmate	That is odd
2014-01-12 13:04:51	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-12 13:07:22	Pikpikmate	I remember the last time I was here we were talkin about Pikmin 1 unused maps again
2014-01-12 13:07:42	Espyo	heh, I can't remember
2014-01-12 13:07:45	Espyo	but it's likely
2014-01-12 13:07:49	Pikpikmate	I'm surprised I remember
2014-01-12 13:07:50	Espyo	unused content is just so awesome to me
2014-01-12 13:07:56	Pikpikmate	Same here
2014-01-12 13:08:18	Pikpikmate	I was gunna ask if anything else was uncovered there
2014-01-12 13:08:29	Espyo	on the caves?
2014-01-12 13:08:34	Espyo	some minor things, let me check my notes
2014-01-12 13:09:01	Espyo	hm, when a cave doesn't have a background, the files use the word "none"
2014-01-12 13:09:20	Espyo	but two or three caves have "vrbox" and "f010" as the backgrounds, which don't map to anything
2014-01-12 13:09:28	Espyo	and are effectively the same as saying "none"
2014-01-12 13:10:18	Espyo	other than that, I didn't find anything else of the sort
2014-01-12 13:10:26	Espyo	but I did find a few discrepancies
2014-01-12 13:10:51	Espyo	Hazard Training's 1st sublevel's file say it has eggs somewhere, but there are none
2014-01-12 13:10:51	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-01-12 13:11:16	Espyo	and a few Chall— thanks Testyo —enge mode levels say they have no exit geyser on the last sublevel, even though they really do
2014-01-12 13:11:27	Espyo	not sure if you met Testyo before
2014-01-12 13:11:38	Pikpikmate	I have
2014-01-12 13:11:38	Espyo	if not, here he is, he's my bot

2014-01-12 15:35:19	Espyo	just checking if there's a wall above, to the left, below and to the right should be enough
2014-01-12 15:35:55	@J	hmm, really?
2014-01-12 15:36:23	Espyo	I can't see why not
2014-01-12 15:36:32	Espyo	if there's a wall between the player and the explosion, don't kill them
2014-01-12 15:36:38	Espyo	graphically, there's not much you can do
2014-01-12 15:36:43	Espyo	except maybe a clipping rectangle
2014-01-12 15:40:04	@J	I mean, why would you check left, right, top, bottom when you can just check in the direction of the player?
2014-01-12 15:41:39	@J	to show it visually, I guess you could have a dense wave of particles with the same speed that stop at walls and stop at the death boundary
2014-01-12 15:41:45	@J	but I'm not sure I can be bothered
2014-01-12 15:42:07	Espyo	uh, yeah
2014-01-12 15:46:10	@J	http://i.imgur.com/c7XmeAw.png
2014-01-12 15:47:14	Espyo	I like that addition
2014-01-12 15:47:34	@J	whatever do you mean?  This is clearly an entirely new stage
2014-01-12 15:48:16	@J	but yeah, it's small enough that you can throw mines over it but not jump over it
2014-01-12 15:49:10	Espyo	nice
2014-01-12 15:49:16	@J	...okay, maybe you can jump over it with a crazy manoeuvre
2014-01-12 15:49:29	@J	I think I'll leave that in
2014-01-12 15:49:53	Espyo	heh
2014-01-12 15:49:56	Espyo	wall jump
2014-01-12 15:50:08	@J	you have to time it right
2014-01-12 15:50:27	@J	you have to do the wall jump when you still have lots of upward speed from the jump
2014-01-12 15:50:38	Espyo	uh...
2014-01-12 15:50:42	Espyo	I can't see why
2014-01-12 15:50:57	@J	for the same reason a double jump is higher than two single jumps
2014-01-12 15:51:30	@J	or, rather, a double jump at the peak of the first jump isn't the highest double jump
2014-01-12 15:51:44	Espyo	well, now you lost me completely
2014-01-12 15:51:48	@J	wait
2014-01-12 15:51:57	@J	when you wall jump, you add some speed upwards
2014-01-12 15:52:05	Espyo	right
2014-01-12 15:52:21	@J	so the more upward speed you already have, the more total upward speed you have afterwards
2014-01-12 15:52:42	Espyo	ah, right

2014-01-12 16:35:08	Espyo	specially when you walk amongst them and they all turn, looks like a cobweb
2014-01-12 16:36:18	@J	wha?
2014-01-12 16:36:36	Espyo	big internal changes made the Pikmin graphics not show up right
2014-01-12 16:36:47	@J	made them show up as ERROR?
2014-01-12 16:36:53	Espyo	and as a safeguard, I made any missing graphic be a red ERROR
2014-01-12 16:37:00	@J	right
2014-01-12 16:37:02	Espyo	it's effective
2014-01-12 16:37:06	Espyo	and trippy when you gather 100 of them

2014-01-13 19:16:58	Espyo	oh look, Pikmin 2's not making sense again
2014-01-13 19:17:10	Espyo	apparently, garden-type caves don't have an echo effect
2014-01-13 19:17:22	Espyo	and that was one of the problems involved in ripping the C-stick melodies
2014-01-13 19:17:39	Espyo	the other problem is the random weird noises and animal clicks
2014-01-13 19:17:57	Espyo	I'll probably rip the melodies today, but first I was checking out how everything worked
2014-01-13 19:18:04	Espyo	and I held the C-stick fully up
2014-01-13 19:18:07	Espyo	that played the song normally
2014-01-13 19:18:11	Espyo	then I held it at a diagonal
2014-01-13 19:18:16	Espyo	and the song played faster
2014-01-13 19:18:36	Espyo	I figured the game doesn't calculate the distance between the stick and the center as well as it should
2014-01-13 19:18:45	Espyo	then I restarted the cave, tried something else, and when I checked again
2014-01-13 19:18:50	Espyo	holding it fully up played it fast
2014-01-13 19:18:54	Espyo	and holding it at a diagonal played it slow
2014-01-13 19:21:15	@J	...
2014-01-13 19:21:25	@J	also, nice timing; I just this second got here
2014-01-13 19:22:50	Espyo	heh
2014-01-13 19:23:10	Espyo	I think even Pikmin 1 has a thing where holding the C-stick diagonally plays the song at a different speed
2014-01-13 19:23:15	Espyo	but I can't remember if it's slower or faster
2014-01-13 19:23:48	Espyo	well, shower now, Pikmin 2 shenanigans later
2014-01-13 19:24:18	@J	yeah, I can imagine them doing volume = abs(axisX) + abs(axisY)
2014-01-13 19:24:26	@J	but the reversed version makes no sense
2014-01-13 19:24:42	Espyo	I know, but...
2014-01-13 19:24:54	Espyo	I doubt I mixed the two
2014-01-13 19:25:19	Espyo	I would just dismiss it, but lately Pikmin 2 has just been proving itself to not make any sense, so...
2014-01-13 19:34:48	@J	yeah, I wasn't doubting you
2014-01-13 19:34:55	@J	not out loud, anyway
2014-01-13 20:01:28	Espyo	I don't know, it keeps doing up = fast, diagonal = slower now
2014-01-13 20:15:03	Espyo	ok
2014-01-13 20:15:04	Espyo	I'm not insane
2014-01-13 20:15:10	Espyo	up = slower, diagonal = faster
2014-01-13 20:15:11	Espyo	just now

2014-01-13 20:31:11	Miles	No, but they're auto-recorded on twitch

2014-01-13 20:44:48	Espyo	and to get them, we have to rip them from the game, or find a Pikmin 2 MIDI player
2014-01-13 20:44:55	Espyo	the problem is, Pikmin NEVER shuts up
2014-01-13 20:45:00	Espyo	there's always something making noise

2014-01-13 20:45:10	@J	yeah, I found that when I was recording ages ago
2014-01-13 20:45:25	Espyo	then there's the echo problem in caves
2014-01-13 20:45:25	@J	and if you're anywhere near the ship, it makes sounds at you

2014-01-13 20:46:14	Espyo	and when I want to record the C-stick sound, I can continuously press down on the D-pad
2014-01-13 20:46:25	Espyo	because there's no army, the captain doesn't fire the spray
2014-01-13 20:46:28	Espyo	but it resets his idle time

2014-01-13 21:10:41	@J	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SvRZpykS6s
2014-01-13 21:10:44	@J	have you seen this?
2014-01-13 21:11:04	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-13 21:11:24	Espyo	well, at the Carmageddon forums, people keep talking about this and that new game with revolutionizing new car crushage code
2014-01-13 21:11:28	Espyo	but I never saw any
2014-01-13 21:15:49	Pikpikmate	I so wish I could get Pikmin 3
2014-01-13 21:16:03	Espyo	same
2014-01-13 21:16:34	Pikpikmate	I saw it at my local store 2 weeks ago and I was so distraught
2014-01-13 21:26:43	Pikpikmate	So there's only one unused Pikmin 2 area?
2014-01-13 21:27:56	Espyo	area, yes
2014-01-13 21:27:57	Espyo	but  caves
2014-01-13 21:28:01	Espyo	*but caves?
2014-01-13 21:28:06	Espyo	there are over 30
2014-01-13 21:28:23	Espyo	ok, Citadel of Spiders sublevel 5 does NOT have any background noise whatsoever
2014-01-13 21:28:32	Pikpikmate	I know there are a lot of unused caves, but actual areas only one
2014-01-13 21:28:36	Espyo	it had some clicking while the BLL was alive, but now that it's dead, it's completely silent
2014-01-13 21:28:44	Espyo	the problem is still the darn echo...
2014-01-13 21:29:02	Espyo	is there any cave with a boss on a garden or toybox-style sublevel?
2014-01-13 21:29:20	Pikpikmate	There's a challenge mode one
2014-01-13 21:29:42	Espyo	Twilight Garden, yes
2014-01-13 21:29:48	Espyo	but the cave's not silent there
2014-01-13 21:29:57	Espyo	it has these weird ambiencebackground noises
2014-01-13 21:30:01	Espyo	*ambience background
2014-01-13 21:30:06	Espyo	sublevel 5 of the CoS doesn't
2014-01-13 21:31:05	Pikpikmate	I don't know any others
2014-01-13 21:31:29	Espyo	...nope, the echo is too noticeable
2014-01-13 21:31:49	Espyo	I guess I'll record on the Awakening Wood
2014-01-13 21:31:55	Espyo	at least the chirps there aren't that noticeable
2014-01-13 21:32:27	Espyo	until we get perfect and lagless-while-recording Pikmin 2 audio emulation, or until we can get rid of the echo or background sound effects for good, we'll have to settle with this
2014-01-13 21:32:47	Pikpikmate	Aw, I just remembered something
2014-01-13 21:32:58	Espyo	hmm?
2014-01-13 21:33:10	Pikpikmate	I remember the Repugnant Appendage how it had a weird glitch
2014-01-13 21:33:39	Pikpikmate	I do have a camera to record it, but the quality'll be meh because I'll have some proof
2014-01-13 21:33:48	Espyo	oh?
2014-01-13 21:33:52	Pikpikmate	Unless I tried it before and proved myself wrong
2014-01-13 21:33:55	Espyo	you could explain, I have the recording equipment set up right now
2014-01-13 21:34:10	Pikpikmate	I won't waste your time if I'm remembering wrong
2014-01-13 21:34:45	Pikpikmate	It has to do with the Frontier Cavern where you get the Repugnant Appendage from the Empress Bulblax there
2014-01-13 21:34:45	Espyo	it's ok
2014-01-13 21:34:59	Espyo	unless it requires actually getting the Repugnant Appendage again
2014-01-13 21:35:04	Pikpikmate	It does
2014-01-13 21:35:09	Pikpikmate	That's why it'll be a pain
2014-01-13 21:35:18	Espyo	:/
2014-01-13 21:35:22	Pikpikmate	Because I remember, true to day, I had like, 6 Pikmin left
2014-01-13 21:35:24	Espyo	I have this save file here
2014-01-13 21:35:27	Espyo	maybe it doesn't have that yet
2014-01-13 21:35:38	Pikpikmate	After fighting that boss, the treasure only weighed 6 Pikmin
2014-01-13 21:36:03	Espyo	hmmm
2014-01-13 21:36:07	Pikpikmate	Idenitcal to my amount I had left, enabling me to carry back the treasure and leave the cave fully completed
2014-01-13 21:36:09	Espyo	you sure they weren't Purples?
2014-01-13 21:36:14	Pikpikmate	I'm sure
2014-01-13 21:36:19	Pikpikmate	Identical*
2014-01-13 21:36:46	Pikpikmate	It was years ago, though, and I'll just attempt it again
2014-01-13 21:37:15	Espyo	I think I remember seeing somewhere that treasures weigh as many Pikmin as you have, for those type of treasures
2014-01-13 21:37:22	Pikpikmate	Do they?
2014-01-13 21:37:29	Pikpikmate	That'd explain everything
2014-01-13 21:38:15	Espyo	J? Miles? can you confirm or deny that?
2014-01-13 21:43:33	@J	maybe vaguely recall something like that, but I'm not sure
2014-01-13 21:43:51	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-13 21:44:07	Espyo	my first encounter with a Man-at-Legs was catastrophic
2014-01-13 21:44:13	Espyo	I ended up with 13 Pikmin or something
2014-01-13 21:44:23	Espyo	and the thing it dropped needed exactly as many Pikmin as I had
2014-01-13 21:44:24	Espyo	so...
2014-01-13 21:44:34	@J	yeah, I can't say I've actually encountered it
2014-01-13 21:44:56	Pikpikmate	I'll check it out
2014-01-13 21:45:07	Espyo	so it should work on any boss that drops something
2014-01-13 21:45:13	Espyo	if you can, go ahead
2014-01-13 21:45:18	Pikpikmate	But uh, don't expect any super HD proof
2014-01-13 21:45:19	Espyo	but if not, I have a save with incomplete caves
2014-01-13 21:45:20	Espyo	so I can test
2014-01-13 21:45:26	Espyo	wait, don't record just yet
2014-01-13 21:45:29	Espyo	if it happens, it's not a glitch
2014-01-13 21:45:38	Pikpikmate	Well, it's still something
2014-01-13 21:45:43	Espyo	it's on purpose, to prevent players from having to refight the boss
2014-01-13 21:45:51	Espyo	it's only worth a mention, no video evidence
2014-01-13 21:46:53	Pikpikmate	Oh wow
2014-01-13 21:47:05	Pikpikmate	I have a save right on the last sublevel of the Hole of Beasts
2014-01-13 21:47:15	Pikpikmate	That's some luck
2014-01-13 21:47:22	Espyo	hah
2014-01-13 21:49:03	Espyo	ok, after unpausing, there's a small delay until the birds continue chirping
2014-01-13 21:49:18	Espyo	but not enough to get the C-stick songs to play effectively enough
2014-01-13 21:51:17	Pikpikmate	Yup
2014-01-13 21:51:33	Pikpikmate	I have 7 Pikmin left, and the treasure weighs 7
2014-01-13 21:51:56	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-13 21:51:58	Espyo	try again
2014-01-13 21:52:01	Espyo	with 1 Pikmin
2014-01-13 21:52:04	Espyo	if you can
2014-01-13 21:52:11	Pikpikmate	Alright

2014-01-13 21:55:08	Pikpikmate	Yup
2014-01-13 21:55:15	Pikpikmate	 1 Pikmin, the treasure now weighs 1
2014-01-13 21:56:21	Pikpikmate	Does it work for all bosses though?
2014-01-13 21:56:24	Espyo	heh, neat
2014-01-13 21:56:29	Espyo	would be interesting to check
2014-01-13 21:56:54	Espyo	want to do the honors and add this info to [[Treasure Hoard]]?
2014-01-13 21:57:10	Pikpikmate	Not until we know when this occurs
2014-01-13 21:57:29	Espyo	hm, true
2014-01-13 21:57:32	Pikpikmate	I've only seen it for the Exploration Kit treasures and from bosses at the end of a cave
2014-01-13 21:57:48	Pikpikmate	What about caves like the Hole of Heroes with multiple bosses with treasures?
2014-01-13 21:57:49	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-13 21:58:14	Espyo	but even still, saying "some treasures" is still better than not saying anything at all
2014-01-13 21:58:16	Espyo	at least for now
2014-01-13 21:59:02	Pikpikmate	The only way I can do the Hole of Heroes is if I play my game from the Hole of Beasts all the way to Wistful Wild
2014-01-13 21:59:18	Pikpikmate	Which is pretty much a lot of the game
2014-01-13 21:59:55	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-13 22:02:35	Espyo	great, I found another cavern with almost no background noises
2014-01-13 22:02:38	Espyo	and it had to have echo
2014-01-13 22:03:38	Pikpikmate	Should I create a Trivia section for this info?
2014-01-13 22:03:50	Espyo	I think its more important that just trivia
2014-01-13 22:04:15	Espyo	maybe this data is somewhere in the game files
2014-01-13 22:04:18	Pikpikmate	It took us this long to find out about it, and not many have heard of it
2014-01-13 22:04:38	Pikpikmate	First time it's going to be documented
2014-01-13 22:08:29	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-13 22:09:17	Pikpikmate	You can edit it into the Treasure Hoard somewhere
2014-01-13 22:09:40	Pikpikmate	I'll play through the game and try to find as many instances as possible of this occurring
2014-01-13 22:10:36	Pikpikmate	Another one that has me wondering is that Mamuta with the Brute Knuckles
2014-01-13 22:11:14	Pikpikmate	That'll prove if it's a boss thing or not
2014-01-13 22:11:32	Pikpikmate	Or wait, does a Mamuta drop it?
2014-01-13 22:12:57	Espyo	it does
2014-01-13 22:13:06	Espyo	but wait, let me check if the data is on the game's files
2014-01-13 22:13:14	Espyo	I'll just rip Pikmin 1's C-stick sound and be done with it
2014-01-13 22:13:18	Pikpikmate	Okay
2014-01-13 22:23:03	Espyo	ok, fine, I can't even record the Pikmin 1 sound
2014-01-13 22:23:23	Espyo	my capture card's kinda busted, the audio comes with noise and only on the right speaker
2014-01-13 22:23:27	Espyo	marvellous
2014-01-13 22:25:26	@J	you broke it already?
2014-01-13 22:26:03	Espyo	apparently
2014-01-13 22:26:23	Espyo	hopefully it's actually my GameCube's cables' fault
2014-01-13 22:26:32	Espyo	because the red cable was the one that was causing problems
2014-01-13 22:26:42	Espyo	and my TV lacks a red cable input
2014-01-13 22:26:52	Pikpikmate	Afk a little while, dinner
2014-01-13 22:26:54	Espyo	it has SCART, and that's what I use for my Wii
2014-01-13 22:27:01	Espyo	but for my GameCube, only the white and yellow are connected
2014-01-13 22:27:06	Espyo	so maybe the red one died out with time
2014-01-13 22:29:47	Espyo	off-topic, if the guy's having so much fun with Next Car Game, he'll adore Carmageddon

2014-01-14 15:44:44	@PikFan	oh
2014-01-14 15:44:49	@PikFan	I remembered something
2014-01-14 15:45:10	@PikFan	so I took the data from my Pikmin 2 Pikmin counts and created a graph
2014-01-14 15:45:23	@PikFan	the rise was almost uniform
2014-01-14 15:45:32	@PikFan	which was hardly surprising
2014-01-14 15:46:21	Espyo	heh, yeah
2014-01-14 15:46:50	@PikFan	speaking of my counts, I haven't updated them in a loooong time
2014-01-14 15:47:40	@PikFan	because I'm stuck on the Cavern of Chaos :|
2014-01-14 15:48:01	Espyo	heh
2014-01-14 15:48:07	@PikFan	but the good news is, I've already made over 900 Pikmin

2014-01-14 15:48:35	@PikFan	well
2014-01-14 15:48:54	@PikFan	I keep going to the CoC over and over again to make Pikmin
2014-01-14 15:49:30	Espyo	oh, that kind of "stuck"
2014-01-14 15:49:50	@PikFan	it's just so /repetitive/
2014-01-14 15:50:33	@PikFan	yeah, I don't think I'm doing this again

2014-01-14 15:51:36	@PikFan	but once the day is finished, I imagine I'll've made somewhere between 1,300-1,400 Pikmin
2014-01-14 15:52:02	@PikFan	well... my calculations were almost right
2014-01-14 15:52:08	Espyo	I'm not getting something

2014-01-14 15:55:08	Espyo	yeah

2014-01-14 15:57:21	Espyo	bleh
2014-01-14 15:57:29	Espyo	although I guess the sprays are only meant to be enhancers
2014-01-14 15:57:34	Espyo	whereas in Pikmin 2, they're game breakers
2014-01-14 15:57:38	Espyo	well, the bitter one, mostly
2014-01-14 15:58:49	Miles	Well
2014-01-14 15:59:06	Miles	It's less time, but it flowers Pikmin, and turns Wingeds into absolute killing machines
2014-01-14 15:59:38	Espyo	wow
2014-01-14 15:59:46	Espyo	well, that changes things
2014-01-14 16:00:04	Miles	In both games, it sets all Pikmin types's attack to 10, and doubles their attacking speed
2014-01-14 16:00:26	Miles	Pikmin 3 now has types with attacks below 10 normally (Wingeds and Whites, at 5)
2014-01-14 16:00:43	Miles	So it doubles their attack and their speed and they can fly

2014-01-14 20:06:57	@J	pfft
2014-01-14 20:07:03	@J	as if I didn't do that by hand
2014-01-14 20:07:14	Espyo	now I'm disappointed
2014-01-14 20:08:12	@J	I remember it being confusing to actually make that
2014-01-14 20:08:36	Espyo	well, the coordinates seem incredibly easy to figure out
2014-01-14 20:09:57	@J	I think joint index determines the point to join at, one of a number of points distributed over the surface of the parent sphere
2014-01-14 20:10:09	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-14 20:10:27	@J	and the child sphere is placed so that it's inside the parent (or the parent is inside the child) before offsets
2014-01-14 20:10:57	@J	I don't recall if you can have children of children
2014-01-14 20:10:58	Espyo	ok, I think I'm seeing how it works
2014-01-14 20:11:05	Espyo	you can, bigfoot is full of them
2014-01-14 20:11:13	Espyo	I don't see the joints coming into play, though
2014-01-14 20:11:20	@J	id/code might be used as references for animations
2014-01-14 20:11:38	@J	don't have an szs extractor to hand
2014-01-14 20:11:46	@J	can you paste a couple of examples?
2014-01-14 20:13:16	Espyo	sure

2014-01-14 20:15:11	@J	so I guess joint index 1 is the top of the sphere
2014-01-14 20:15:20	@J	0 would be bottom
2014-01-14 20:15:35	Espyo	I don't see that, and I'll tell you why
2014-01-14 20:15:39	@J	wait, maybe
2014-01-14 20:15:44	Espyo	you're looking at the egg, right?
2014-01-14 20:15:56	@J	yeah, not sure why egg defines non-0 parent joint index
2014-01-14 20:16:04	Espyo	the child is at 11
2014-01-14 20:16:09	Espyo	the parent is at 12
2014-01-14 20:16:11	Espyo	both Y
2014-01-14 20:16:19	Espyo	so the child's center should be below the parent
2014-01-14 20:16:35	Espyo	though if you assume the child's coordinates are relative to the parent's, it makes sense
2014-01-14 20:16:49	Espyo	and look at the child's radius, 12
2014-01-14 20:16:58	Espyo	so the child's center is at 12 + 11 = 23
2014-01-14 20:17:15	Espyo	plus the radius, means the lowest point of the child is 23 - 12 = 11
2014-01-14 20:17:21	Espyo	so, roughly the center of the parent
2014-01-14 20:17:25	Espyo	and according to your drawing, that's exactly it
2014-01-14 20:18:04	@J	hmm

2014-01-14 20:19:26	Espyo	so the joints don't look like they're taken into account for that
2014-01-14 20:19:30	Espyo	could be something else, though
2014-01-14 20:19:44	@J	you get almost the same result if joint 0 means top, and it aligns from there
2014-01-14 20:20:14	@J	I remember roughly trying out some other more complex ones and having it being really off just doing the offsets
2014-01-14 20:20:22	@J	...maybe
2014-01-14 20:20:48	@J	well, it's really easy to draw them with just the offsets, so let me try it

2014-01-14 20:38:40	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-14 20:38:43	Espyo	let's try something simpler then

2014-01-14 20:40:19	@J	so clearly doesn't work
2014-01-14 20:40:29	@J	joint index is 5
2014-01-14 20:40:48	@J	that means it's probably one of the axis-aligned ones (of which there are 6)
2014-01-14 20:41:04	Espyo	hm...
2014-01-14 20:41:11	@J	given egg uses 0, I would guess top and bottom are 0 and 1
2014-01-14 20:41:14	@J	making this a sideways
2014-01-14 20:41:18	Espyo	right
2014-01-14 20:42:09	@J	...wait, I missed the 3rd sphere here
2014-01-14 20:42:38	@J	joint index 4, maybe the opposite side?
2014-01-14 20:42:45	@J	it's because you said it only has 2...
2014-01-14 20:43:13	Espyo	oh drat

2014-01-14 21:04:17	Espyo	also what's the full command? you kinda went off on a tangent there
2014-01-14 21:04:19	@J	(it's sorted)
2014-01-14 21:04:23	@J	that was the full command
2014-01-14 21:04:31	Espyo	you said a lot of "that"s
2014-01-14 21:04:48	@J	grep joint */enemycoll.txt | sort -n
2014-01-14 21:04:51	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 21:05:14	@J	I guess to do it properly...
2014-01-14 21:05:28	Espyo	this... is only really sorting alphabetically
2014-01-14 21:05:30	@J	grep joint */enemycoll.txt | ack '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq
2014-01-14 21:05:31	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-01-14 21:05:39	Espyo	oh, heh
2014-01-14 21:05:40	@J	okay, maybe because of the comments
2014-01-14 21:05:45	@J	let me check that's how ack works
2014-01-14 21:05:45	Espyo	it's sorting the numbers, by enemy
2014-01-14 21:05:52	@J	whaa
2014-01-14 21:05:58	@J	grep is printing filenames?
2014-01-14 21:06:38	@J	do '-h' after 'grep'
2014-01-14 21:06:42	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/19zB6f9W yep
2014-01-14 21:06:43	@J	grep -h joint
2014-01-14 21:06:52	Espyo	that's the last few
2014-01-14 21:07:19	@J	grep -h joint */enemycoll.txt | ack '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq
2014-01-14 21:07:19	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-01-14 21:07:32	@J	you know, I probably could've got szs extraction working properly by now
2014-01-14 21:07:57	Espyo	can't find ack
2014-01-14 21:08:14	@J	...
2014-01-14 21:08:15	@J	*awk
2014-01-14 21:08:19	@J	am crazy
2014-01-14 21:08:27	Espyo	pfft
2014-01-14 21:08:29	@J	I even just did a test and typed awk instead
2014-01-14 21:08:43	Espyo	ah
2014-01-14 21:08:45	Espyo	much better
2014-01-14 21:08:52	Espyo	 0 - 43
2014-01-14 21:08:56	@J	hmm
2014-01-14 21:09:01	@J	how clustered are they?
2014-01-14 21:09:05	@J	I mean-
2014-01-14 21:09:09	@J	...just paste the whole thing
2014-01-14 21:09:10	Espyo	 20 is missing
2014-01-14 21:09:17	Espyo	as is 22, 25—
2014-01-14 21:09:26	@J	I wanted to find the maximum
2014-01-14 21:09:38	Espyo	http://mibpaste.com/I0xR2e 
2014-01-14 21:09:41	@J	so if only every other one or so is missing to 43, it's probably around 43
2014-01-14 21:09:46	@J	invalid link
2014-01-14 21:09:53	Espyo	...dammit Mibbit
2014-01-14 21:09:57	Espyo	fine, I'll take the long way
2014-01-14 21:09:58	Espyo	or...
2014-01-14 21:10:00	Espyo	 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 23 24 26 28 29 30 31 32 33 37 40 43
2014-01-14 21:10:02	Espyo	that works
2014-01-14 21:10:09	@J	yeah, that works
2014-01-14 21:10:14	@J	how did you join them?
2014-01-14 21:10:26	Espyo	Mibbit can't one line at a time
2014-01-14 21:11:30	@J	BTW, the pastebin thing I use would let me pipe it into it
2014-01-14 21:11:39	@J	grep ... | ... | pb
2014-01-14 21:11:56	@J	alias pb='curl -F '\''sprunge=<-'\'' http://sprunge.us'
2014-01-14 21:12:03	@J	put that in your ~/.bashrc and you have it too
2014-01-14 21:12:12	@J	anyway, yeah, I guess it's around 45
2014-01-14 21:12:14	@J	hmm
2014-01-14 21:12:21	Espyo	I got absolutely nothing of that
2014-01-14 21:17:32	Pikpikmate	Oh, I just tested the Waterwraith thing in Submerged Castle, how long it takes for him to appear
2014-01-14 21:17:41	Pikpikmate	It does take exactly 5 minutes
2014-01-14 21:18:23	Espyo	nice
2014-01-14 21:18:37	Espyo	ok, that means the Waterwraith's timer on the game files works in seconds
2014-01-14 21:18:45	Espyo	but the Challenge mode timer doesn't
2014-01-14 21:18:58	Espyo	hm, I actually think every timer tick on the Challenge Mode clock is 2 seconds
2014-01-14 21:19:02	Pikpikmate	But I tell ya, that has to be the scariest part of Pikmin 2
2014-01-14 21:19:10	Pikpikmate	That cave still creeps me out
2014-01-14 21:19:21	Espyo	hehe yeah
2014-01-14 21:21:55	Pikpikmate	The Waterwraith is programmed to drop the Professional Noisemaker in all sublevels?
2014-01-14 21:25:07	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 21:25:45	Pikpikmate	Does that mean you can get multiple treasures?
2014-01-14 21:25:56	Pikpikmate	Through cheating of course
2014-01-14 21:26:44	Espyo	it should
2014-01-14 21:26:51	@J	http://i.imgur.com/tsWu5qX.png
2014-01-14 21:26:56	@J	well, I spent time making it draw nicer...
2014-01-14 21:27:05	Espyo	dunno what that would imply to the game
2014-01-14 21:27:14	Pikpikmate	That'd be a really neat thing to try
2014-01-14 21:27:20	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 21:27:48	Pikpikmate	I'd assume there's a fail-safe, though
2014-01-14 21:28:38	Pikpikmate	Either that or the game'll just crash, I'd put my bets on either of those
2014-01-14 21:29:04	Espyo	I think the game would be fine; at least, you can get duplicate treasures in Challenge Mode
2014-01-14 21:32:36	Pikpikmate	But that's different, especially considering the treasure we're talking about is an Exploration Kit one
2014-01-14 21:32:44	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 21:32:59	Espyo	I'm guessing it would play the cutscene, and then add nothing to your inventory
2014-01-14 21:33:09	Pikpikmate	It could do that, too
2014-01-14 21:33:33	Pikpikmate	I wish I had some cheating device or something to try it with
2014-01-14 21:33:59	Espyo	brb, dinner
2014-01-14 21:51:22	@J	grep -h joint */enemycoll.txt | sed s/:/:\ / | awk '{print $2, $1}' | sort -n | uniq
2014-01-14 21:51:22	Testyo	$ 2 = 1.4744 € / £ 1.261 
2014-01-14 21:51:35	@J	do that when you get back to find files with low-numbered joints in
2014-01-14 21:51:58	@J	and also
2014-01-14 21:52:09	@J	hmm...
2014-01-14 21:53:55	@J	echo */enemycoll.txt | while read f; do grep joint "$f" | wc -l; echo "$f"; done | sort -n
2014-01-14 21:54:05	@J	to get files with not many parts
2014-01-14 21:57:55	Espyo	........well
2014-01-14 21:58:00	Espyo	I get the number of joints (I presume)
2014-01-14 21:58:03	Espyo	but not the filenames
2014-01-14 21:58:15	Espyo	also it's sorted alphabetically, which sucks
2014-01-14 21:58:24	Espyo	(1, 10, 11, ..., 19, 2, 20, ...)
2014-01-14 21:59:00	@J	well that failed
2014-01-14 21:59:06	@J	need to remove the -d
2014-01-14 21:59:08	@J	*-h
2014-01-14 22:00:03	Espyo	bigfoot has 0, kingchappy has 33, 37, 40 and 43
2014-01-14 22:00:05	Espyo	err...
2014-01-14 22:02:31	@J	never mind, I bothered to extract myself
2014-01-14 22:02:57	Espyo	heh
2014-01-14 22:03:59	@J	the other command gives...interesting results
2014-01-14 22:04:36	@J	okay, lots only have 2 joints
2014-01-14 22:04:56	@J	or parts, or whatever
2014-01-14 22:08:11	@J	know which frog is which Wollywog?
2014-01-14 22:09:13	@J	hmm, this one has a more vertically offset second part, so I'm guessing yellow
2014-01-14 22:09:22	@J	the 'frog' one
2014-01-14 22:09:51	Espyo	MaroFrog is White
2014-01-14 22:09:58	Espyo	err... it's Wollywog
2014-01-14 22:10:02	Espyo	Frog is Yellow Wollywog
2014-01-14 22:10:59	@J	okay, that fits
2014-01-14 22:11:25	@J	I assume y is the vertical co-ordinate
2014-01-14 22:11:32	@J	do you know which way is up?
2014-01-14 22:11:45	@J	in Pikmin 2 in other places, maybe
2014-01-14 22:12:42	Pikpikmate	Didn't they change the Wollywog's name now?
2014-01-14 22:12:47	Pikpikmate	In newer games?
2014-01-14 22:12:52	Espyo	I do not know @Y
2014-01-14 22:15:32	Espyo	the NPC games call them Wollywops, yeah
2014-01-14 22:15:36	Espyo	I think Pikmin 3 does as well
2014-01-14 22:16:00	Pikpikmate	Wollyhops, isn't it?
2014-01-14 22:16:10	Espyo	oh, yeah, that
2014-01-14 22:16:24	Pikpikmate	I don't understand why
2014-01-14 22:16:37	@J	look up wollywog
2014-01-14 22:16:38	Pikpikmate	But I'm never going to use or even get used to the new names
2014-01-14 22:16:45	Espyo	same
2014-01-14 22:17:16	@J	wait, I'm sure it was a thing
2014-01-14 22:17:23	Espyo	it was
2014-01-14 22:17:25	@J	maybe a similar word
2014-01-14 22:17:26	Espyo	a narcotic?
2014-01-14 22:17:34	Pikpikmate	I can't find anything
2014-01-14 22:17:37	@J	ah, wog
2014-01-14 22:17:59	Pikpikmate	Oh, it's British
2014-01-14 22:18:04	Pikpikmate	No wonder I had no clue
2014-01-14 22:20:17	@J	it's also probably Victorian British, so there's really no hope
2014-01-14 22:20:43	Pikpikmate	I've never heard of it, and I've heard no complaints about it
2014-01-14 22:20:58	Pikpikmate	I think it's just Nintendo being paranoid over nothing
2014-01-14 22:21:35	Espyo	typical
2014-01-14 22:22:39	@J	but if you hear that something you named could be an insult, you probably want to change it
2014-01-14 22:22:56	@J	I believe there was a software thing recently that had something like that...
2014-01-14 22:23:01	@J	it was a Russian insult
2014-01-14 22:23:07	@J	mm...
2014-01-14 22:23:12	@J	Pidora, that was it
2014-01-14 22:23:43	Miles	Wollywogs were only changed in PAL versions
2014-01-14 22:23:53	Miles	Still Wollywog in the US
2014-01-14 22:24:01	@J	hmm, didn't know that
2014-01-14 22:24:03	@J	how about NPC?
2014-01-14 22:24:08	Miles	Same
2014-01-14 22:24:11	Pikpikmate	That's still kind of lame
2014-01-14 22:27:30	Espyo	hmmm
2014-01-14 22:28:00	Espyo	'In the PAL version of New Play Control! Pikmin 2 and Pikmin 3 they are known as "Wollyhops"' — Pikipedia
2014-01-14 22:29:37	@J	can anyone try throwing some Pikmin at a poison pipe to see what sort of shape the hitbox is?
2014-01-14 22:30:26	@J	because it has 2 spheres with no offsets at all
2014-01-14 22:31:42	Espyo	it's... spherical
2014-01-14 22:32:58	@J	great
2014-01-14 22:33:06	@J	so it actually has 2 spheres with 1 inside the other?
2014-01-14 22:33:48	@J	do we know what the Waterwraith roller things get called?
2014-01-14 22:34:15	@J	hmm, never mind ('type')
2014-01-14 22:34:18	@J	*tyre
2014-01-14 22:37:08	--	Cactus is now known as CactuSleep
2014-01-14 22:40:27	@J	yeah, so I have no idea how all this stuff works
2014-01-14 22:40:53	@J	http://i.imgur.com/xleyY6u.png
2014-01-14 22:41:01	@J	I mean, how do you make a Waterwraith out of those?
2014-01-14 22:44:26	Espyo	top-view, the big one is the Purple stun range?
2014-01-14 22:45:03	Espyo	that's with the joints method, right?
2014-01-14 22:48:55	@J	well, that's x and y plotted
2014-01-14 22:49:02	@J	no, that's your rubbish method
2014-01-14 22:49:29	@J	purple stun range is a crazy, crazy thought
2014-01-14 22:51:27	@J	there _is_ something going on with the size of the first sphere, though
2014-01-14 22:52:41	@J	the size ratios make much more sense if you ignore it
2014-01-14 22:55:11	Espyo	hmmmm
2014-01-14 22:55:15	Espyo	maybe it depends on the parent?
2014-01-14 22:55:19	Espyo	that wouldn't explain the egg
2014-01-14 23:02:15	@J	hmm, I may be crazy
2014-01-14 23:02:51	@J	because the ids say which part is which
2014-01-14 23:06:52	Espyo	what do you mean?
2014-01-14 23:08:23	@J	{body} # id
2014-01-14 23:08:35	@J	{boun} # id
2014-01-14 23:08:44	@J	{head} # id
2014-01-14 23:10:31	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-14 23:10:41	Espyo	I noticed a lot of them don't have one, though
2014-01-14 23:11:20	@J	true
2014-01-14 23:11:24	@J	but the ones that exist will help
2014-01-14 23:11:31	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 23:11:44	Espyo	can't wait for the Engrish ones
2014-01-14 23:12:10	@J	well, they're limited to 4 letters, so abbreviations everywhere
2014-01-14 23:12:17	@J	Japanese abbreviations...
2014-01-14 23:12:17	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 23:12:47	@J	this one has 'head' and 'mune' = 'chest', though
2014-01-14 23:12:53	@J	and 'kosi'
2014-01-14 23:13:16	Espyo	hm
2014-01-14 23:14:24	Espyo	what's the big Waterwraith circle's id
2014-01-14 23:14:25	Espyo	*?
2014-01-14 23:16:02	@J	none
2014-01-14 23:16:15	Espyo	drat
2014-01-14 23:16:22	@J	I see 'none' for lots of parent ids
2014-01-14 23:16:30	@J	also 'boun', I'm assuming boundary
2014-01-14 23:17:13	Espyo	crazy idea: what if parents are not actual hitboxes, but just delimiters?
2014-01-14 23:17:19	Espyo	if a child goes past the parent, that area doesn't count
2014-01-14 23:18:42	@J	one has root and one has body
2014-01-14 23:18:49	@J	as ids for the parent
2014-01-14 23:19:00	@J	hmm, maybe
2014-01-14 23:19:10	@J	either way, I think discounting them for the main shape is the way to go
2014-01-14 23:19:20	@J	but I'm still not sure how to place the children
2014-01-14 23:19:53	Espyo	yeah...
2014-01-14 23:19:57	Espyo	only the egg makes sense, really
2014-01-14 23:20:04	@J	Mamuta has body, Ranging Bloyster has root
2014-01-14 23:20:08	@J	 /useful
2014-01-14 23:21:03	@J	RLL has 4 feet, right?
2014-01-14 23:21:04	Testyo	4 feet = 121.92 cm
2014-01-14 23:21:06	Espyo	body help
2014-01-14 23:21:08	Espyo	 4, yeah
2014-01-14 23:21:16	Espyo	M-a-L, RLL and BLL
2014-01-14 23:21:47	Espyo	Dweevils too
2014-01-14 23:22:02	@J	there are 4 children with children in RLL
2014-01-14 23:22:02	Espyo	hmm, I think Dweevils have 4 feet and 2 arms
2014-01-14 23:22:02	Testyo	4 feet = 121.92 cm
2014-01-14 23:22:09	@J	plus 5 other children
2014-01-14 23:22:12	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-14 23:22:31	@J	it goes child -> child -> child -> child 4 times, so I'm guessing they're the legs
2014-01-14 23:22:38	@J	so those should give how to position them
2014-01-14 23:23:16	@J	hmm...
2014-01-14 23:23:18	@J	maybe not
2014-01-14 23:23:22	@J	ignore those
2014-01-14 23:23:25	@J	because they're small
2014-01-14 23:23:28	@J	I think they're the legs
2014-01-14 23:23:34	Espyo	I suppose the children and their coordinates, and maybe joints, must have to do with rotations and translations for animations
2014-01-14 23:23:35	@J	then there's one with radius 70, 4 with radius 40
2014-01-14 23:23:39	@J	so body and feet
2014-01-14 23:23:53	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-14 23:24:04	@J	yeah, thinking about it that way, this seems like a sensible system
2014-01-14 23:24:05	Espyo	also, these are probably for the T-model
2014-01-14 23:24:15	@J	everything's a sphere, and positions are defined by angles (I think)
2014-01-14 23:24:21	@J	T-model?
2014-01-14 23:24:25	Espyo	which shouldn't be too convulsed for the likes of the RLL
2014-01-14 23:24:30	Espyo	yeah, you know, the default pose on models
2014-01-14 23:24:35	@J	oh, yeah
2014-01-14 23:24:41	Espyo	it's named after human character models, the default pose is them holding their arms in a T
2014-01-14 23:24:43	@J	parent radius is 225, which is huge
2014-01-14 23:24:50	Espyo	yeah...
2014-01-14 23:25:02	Espyo	could be something of the sort of visibility area
2014-01-14 23:25:13	Espyo	if this hitbox enters the viewing area, render the enemy
2014-01-14 23:25:15	Espyo	otherwise, don't bother
2014-01-14 23:25:29	@J	ahaaaa
2014-01-14 23:25:40	@J	I think the offsets are _after_ rotation
2014-01-14 23:25:49	Espyo	well yeah
2014-01-14 23:25:52	@J	the feet are on joints 3, 6, 9, 12
2014-01-14 23:25:54	Espyo	they should
2014-01-14 23:26:16	@J	I mean, the axes of the offsets are rotated too
2014-01-14 23:26:24	@J	because every leg has the same offset
2014-01-14 23:26:29	@J	10 -15
2014-01-14 23:26:42	@J	*foot
2014-01-14 23:27:22	Espyo	hm
2014-01-14 23:28:04	@J	now, an offset around the parent makes no sense here (or in most situations), so that's probably z
2014-01-14 23:28:16	@J	then one will be in/out, one up/down
2014-01-14 23:28:21	@J	'up'/'down'
2014-01-14 23:28:38	@J	along the circle through the poles
2014-01-14 23:28:41	@J	of the parent
2014-01-14 23:29:21	@J	the body has no x-offset, and it wouldn't make sense to move it up/down, so y must be in/out
2014-01-14 23:29:29	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-14 23:30:21	@J	so there are probably 12 points around the sphere at this height
2014-01-14 23:30:28	@J	wait

2014-01-15 00:23:10	Espyo	heh
2014-01-15 00:23:23	Espyo	so there's no consequence in letting your Pikmin be shaken off?
2014-01-15 00:23:24	Miles	Yes, that's why I didn't say Pikmin 3
2014-01-15 00:23:33	Miles	Because then it'd be Pikmin in Pikmin 3
2014-01-15 00:23:41	ThePikminMeister	Ummm I guess I'll go now if I'm not needed
2014-01-15 00:23:50	Espyo	you can stay
2014-01-15 00:23:57	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2014-01-15 00:23:57	Miles	And yeah, aside from them being vulnerable to attack etc.
2014-01-15 00:24:06	Espyo	not so much a question about being needed as it is about staying and chatting if you want to
2014-01-15 00:24:28	ThePikminMeister	True
2014-01-15 00:24:33	Miles	Even when they're planted, they don't loop back to leaves anymore
2014-01-15 00:24:40	Miles	And if replanted they stay as flowers
2014-01-15 00:25:04	@PikFan	also if you leave Pikmin planted overnight, they flower 
2014-01-15 00:25:38	Miles	But yeah, they got rid of a lot of luck-based stuff in Pikmin 3

2014-01-15 00:26:12	Espyo	...
2014-01-15 00:26:26	@PikFan	also is it me or do certain eggs give only ultra spicy spray?
2014-01-15 00:26:26	Miles	So did anyone here watch my AGDQ run

2014-01-15 00:26:35	@PikFan	no, sorry

2014-01-15 00:37:58	@PikFan	..........then again, that was on wikia
2014-01-15 00:38:04	@PikFan	and wikia is trash
2014-01-15 00:39:16	ThePikminMeister	I don't exactly know the whole story of the wikia and niwa and that stuff
2014-01-15 00:39:34	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-15 00:39:37	Espyo	ok, to put it shortly:
2014-01-15 00:39:50	Espyo	in the beginning, we created a Pikmin wiki on wikia
2014-01-15 00:39:55	Espyo	it was a great site
2014-01-15 00:40:03	Espyo	then it became enforcing stupid layout and rules
2014-01-15 00:40:08	Espyo	so we left to our own site, pikminwiki.com
2014-01-15 00:40:16	Espyo	the Pikmin wiki at wikia was left in the dust
2014-01-15 00:40:26	Espyo	eventually, Pikmin 3 started becoming news
2014-01-15 00:40:31	@PikFan	but stupidly, people became interested there
2014-01-15 00:40:34	Espyo	and people tried finding a wiki for Pikmin
2014-01-15 00:40:41	Espyo	the wikia one was the highest result on Google, over being the oldest
2014-01-15 00:40:44	Espyo	so people went there
2014-01-15 00:40:46	Espyo	and now we have two
2014-01-15 00:40:53	Espyo	wikia is still horrible to this day
2014-01-15 00:40:54	ThePikminMeister	Hey wait
2014-01-15 00:40:58	ThePikminMeister	I have a question
2014-01-15 00:41:12	ThePikminMeister	Sir Pikmin
2014-01-15 00:41:41	@PikFan	what about him?
2014-01-15 00:42:01	ThePikminMeister	It says on the wikia that he was banned
2014-01-15 00:42:09	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2014-01-15 00:42:22	@PikFan	because he doesn't like wikia either
2014-01-15 00:42:28	@PikFan	plus he's a Fanon admin
2014-01-15 00:42:30	@PikFan	you see
2014-01-15 00:42:35	ThePikminMeister	So why was he banned?
2014-01-15 00:42:37	@PikFan	Pikmin Fanon was also on wikia
2014-01-15 00:42:51	@PikFan	and we moved to pikminfanon.com
2014-01-15 00:43:02	@PikFan	so wikia deadmined him and banned him
2014-01-15 00:43:13	@PikFan	along with all the other admins
2014-01-15 00:43:22	ThePikminMeister	Oh
2014-01-15 00:43:26	@PikFan	well
2014-01-15 00:43:34	@PikFan	afaik they just deadmined
2014-01-15 00:43:39	@PikFan	not sure about the banning part
2014-01-15 00:44:09	ThePikminMeister	I also saw something about vandalism on his page
2014-01-15 00:44:35	Espyo	just shows how intolerant wikia is
2014-01-15 00:44:50	@PikFan	oh, he was linking to vandalism... /failed/ vandalism
2014-01-15 00:44:54	Espyo	oh, somebody is trying to focus more on the info and want to get away from us because we have bad rules?
2014-01-15 00:44:57	Espyo	let's ban him!
2014-01-15 00:45:07	Espyo	it's clearly his fault

2014-01-15 01:01:57	Espyo	but eventually I was invited to play some Brawl, so that got postponed
2014-01-15 01:02:03	ThePikminMeister	Oh
2014-01-15 01:02:43	ThePikminMeister	How are the areas going to be made?
2014-01-15 01:05:47	Espyo	they'll have to be drawn, line by line
2014-01-15 01:05:53	Espyo	I'll try to make the process painless
2014-01-15 01:06:03	ThePikminMeister	Ok
2014-01-15 01:06:14	ThePikminMeister	Because I'm not a very good drawer
2014-01-15 01:06:37	Espyo	well, I'll always be available to help draw some areas
2014-01-15 01:06:43	ThePikminMeister	Yay
2014-01-15 01:06:50	Espyo	also, I think I'll create some areas at random myself, and share around, free of use
2014-01-15 01:06:57	ThePikminMeister	How are you so good at programming?
2014-01-15 01:06:59	Espyo	so people who don't want to draw their own can use mine
2014-01-15 01:07:04	Espyo	hehe, I'm just ok
2014-01-15 01:07:56	ThePikminMeister	I actually have quite a few ideas for the layout of some of my areas
2014-01-15 01:08:18	ThePikminMeister	Except I'm not sure about some enemy ideas
2014-01-15 01:10:27	Espyo	point them down
2014-01-15 01:10:28	ThePikminMeister	Maybe I'll have some pearly clam clamps that have lasers coming out of their mouths, and there will be buttons on the ground that pikmin can throw to hold them down, and it will disarm the laser so that you are able to access a dungeon
2014-01-15 01:10:30	Espyo	it's never too early
2014-01-15 01:10:34	ThePikminMeister	Woah that was long
2014-01-15 01:10:39	Espyo	heh
2014-01-15 01:10:40	Espyo	hmmm
2014-01-15 01:10:50	Espyo	well, the way I'm making enemy scripts can make that work, no problem
2014-01-15 01:10:53	Espyo	but there are some minor drawbacks
2014-01-15 01:11:01	Espyo	like the switches having to be in predetermined places
2014-01-15 01:11:09	Espyo	in relation to the clam clamp
2014-01-15 01:11:17	ThePikminMeister	What does that mean?
2014-01-15 01:11:20	-->	Gamefreak (Fassad@nxg-80-831-876-818.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #pikipedia
2014-01-15 01:11:39	Espyo	I have to make a custom enemy system that's both powerful enough to create all sorts of enemies, but also simple enough that it doesn't become hefty
2014-01-15 01:11:52	ThePikminMeister	Maybe instead of buttons
2014-01-15 01:11:54	Espyo	so the way I'm imagining it, it'll be hard to connect a "clam clamp" to a "button"
2014-01-15 01:12:19	ThePikminMeister	I could make a pikmin that is only accessible for that part of the area
2014-01-15 01:12:35	ThePikminMeister	And it will be strong enough to hold the clam clamp's mouth open
2014-01-15 01:12:44	ThePikminMeister	And strong enough to block the laser
2014-01-15 01:15:30	Espyo	ok, let me rephrase what I was thinking
2014-01-15 01:15:44	Espyo	the most logical thing is a laser clam clamp being an object
2014-01-15 01:15:47	Espyo	and the button being a different one
2014-01-15 01:15:49	Espyo	and they're connected
2014-01-15 01:15:59	Espyo	but the current system I have doesn't really allow "connectedness"
2014-01-15 01:16:05	Espyo	so they'll have to be the same object
2014-01-15 01:16:19	Espyo	which means they'll always be at the same distance from one another
2014-01-15 01:16:25	Espyo	but that's all details, doesn't matter much now
2014-01-15 01:16:45	ThePikminMeister	But I like the idea of the pikmin type that is accessible for that part of the game
2014-01-15 01:17:02	ThePikminMeister	Because you can throw it at the clam clamp
2014-01-15 01:17:09	ThePikminMeister	And the laser stops
2014-01-15 01:18:11	ThePikminMeister	But would that be too hard?
2014-01-15 01:19:31	Espyo	no worries
2014-01-15 01:19:36	Espyo	it's not too hard
2014-01-15 01:19:44	Espyo	something like...
2014-01-15 01:19:51	Espyo	when a clam clamp is hit
2014-01-15 01:20:02	Espyo	if the pikmin that hit is a XXX
2014-01-15 01:20:07	Espyo	then set the laser to not shooting
2014-01-15 01:20:17	Espyo	it's that, but slightly more script-like
2014-01-15 01:20:23	ThePikminMeister	XXX?
2014-01-15 01:20:29	Espyo	and I'm always available to help script
2014-01-15 01:20:38	Espyo	yeah, replace XXX with the Pikmin type you're thinking, for this example
2014-01-15 01:20:43	ThePikminMeister	Oh ok
2014-01-15 01:20:52	Espyo	but don't let the engine limit you
2014-01-15 01:20:57	Espyo	let your imagination run wild
2014-01-15 01:21:03	Espyo	whether something works on the engine or not is not what matters
2014-01-15 01:21:04	ThePikminMeister	I have a ton of ideas
2014-01-15 01:21:09	Espyo	point them all down
2014-01-15 01:21:11	ThePikminMeister	I'm very creative

2014-01-15 01:22:37	ThePikminMeister	apparently i cant switch to another tab for a second
2014-01-15 01:24:03	Espyo	it's great to be creative
2014-01-15 01:24:10	ThePikminMeister	i know
2014-01-15 01:24:11	Espyo	but yeah, point down anything and everything you come up with
2014-01-15 01:24:23	@PikFan	hmm, a clamclamp that shoots lasers?
2014-01-15 01:24:24	Espyo	it's better to have loads of ideas, even if some are bad, than to miss good ones
2014-01-15 01:24:27	@PikFan	interesting
2014-01-15 01:24:30	Espyo	I like it, sounds fun
2014-01-15 01:24:40	ThePikminMeister	thank you
2014-01-15 01:25:11	@PikFan	Espyo: how are you going to design bosses
2014-01-15 01:25:17	Espyo	same way
2014-01-15 01:25:24	Espyo	the way I've set up works for every boss in Pikmin 1 and 2
2014-01-15 01:25:30	Espyo	fun thing, actually
2014-01-15 01:25:35	@PikFan	what about 3 bosses?
2014-01-15 01:25:45	Espyo	only ONE enemy (two, actually, but yeah) does not work entirely with the system I have in mind
2014-01-15 01:26:00	ThePikminMeister	i actually don't have many ideas for bosses in my fan game
2014-01-15 01:26:06	ThePikminMeister	i just have names
2014-01-15 01:28:29	Espyo	the system is fairly simple, and the bosses are fairly complex
2014-01-15 01:28:40	Espyo	but ONE enemy manages to do something the system can't handle, at the moment
2014-01-15 01:28:43	Espyo	of all things...
2014-01-15 01:28:48	Espyo	Spotted Jellyfloats
2014-01-15 01:28:49	ThePikminMeister	what is it?
2014-01-15 01:28:50	ThePikminMeister	oh
2014-01-15 01:29:00	Espyo	the way they store Pikmin and eat them with time is kinda complex
2014-01-15 01:29:11	Espyo	I'd have to implement a way to have a list of Pikmin stored inside
2014-01-15 01:29:19	Espyo	as well as a way to randomly pick Pikmin from within
2014-01-15 01:29:28	Espyo	which is really different from anything else I have at the moment
2014-01-15 01:29:39	Espyo	I'm not sure about Pikmin 3 bosses, I don't know any
2014-01-15 01:29:45	Espyo	but I fear some might not
2014-01-15 01:29:52	Espyo	if they have too magical gimmicks
2014-01-15 01:30:09	ThePikminMeister	well let's see
2014-01-15 01:30:26	@PikFan	what about, say, the Armored Mawdad
2014-01-15 01:30:58	ThePikminMeister	basically all you have to do is break it's shell with rock pikmin and then attack it
2014-01-15 01:31:24	ThePikminMeister	the only thing i could imagine being fairly complex is where it climbs onto the ceiling
2014-01-15 01:32:52	Espyo	dunno how it works
2014-01-15 01:32:59	Espyo	but I think it would work, from what I know
2014-01-15 01:33:03	@PikFan	wait, I realized something
2014-01-15 01:33:07	ThePikminMeister	what?
2014-01-15 01:33:08	Espyo	you use Rocks to crack its armor, and then it's vulnerable?
2014-01-15 01:33:14	ThePikminMeister	yes
2014-01-15 01:33:22	@PikFan	Espyo, you said the engine will be 2D, right?
2014-01-15 01:33:27	Espyo	mhm, top-view
2014-01-15 01:33:33	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-15 01:33:41	@PikFan	Armored Mawdad might not work
2014-01-15 01:33:45	ThePikminMeister	oh yeah
2014-01-15 01:33:50	Espyo	(also I'm still on MKWii, hence my pauses)
2014-01-15 01:33:56	Espyo	it climbs to the ceiling and falls, right?
2014-01-15 01:33:58	Espyo	I think it'd work
2014-01-15 01:34:05	Espyo	unless you need to see it in the ceiling
2014-01-15 01:34:10	@PikFan	no, it climbs to the walls
2014-01-15 01:34:16	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-15 01:34:16	ThePikminMeister	yeah
2014-01-15 01:34:33	@PikFan	you said top-down, right?
2014-01-15 01:34:58	@PikFan	so does that mean like Pikmin 2, where you could change the angle so that you looked from a top-down viewpoint?
2014-01-15 01:35:27	ThePikminMeister	have you tried the engine yet pikfan?
2014-01-15 01:36:02	@PikFan	no
2014-01-15 01:36:06	Espyo	yep
2014-01-15 01:36:06	ThePikminMeister	oh
2014-01-15 01:36:12	Espyo	(you could do that in Pikmin 1 too)
2014-01-15 01:36:21	Espyo	it's fairly robust at the moemnt
2014-01-15 01:36:22	Espyo	*moment
2014-01-15 01:36:24	Espyo	fun to play around in, too
2014-01-15 01:36:35	ThePikminMeister	yeah
2014-01-15 01:37:08	@PikFan	hm
2014-01-15 01:41:01	ThePikminMeister	awkward silence broken
2014-01-15 01:41:43	@PikFan	a couple years ago, there was this user who would say "SILENCE BREAKER"
2014-01-15 01:42:04	ThePikminMeister	well now
2014-01-15 01:42:11	ThePikminMeister	i have to be that user
2014-01-15 01:42:42	@PikFan	he said he copyrighted it though
2014-01-15 01:42:52	ThePikminMeister	oh
2014-01-15 01:45:09	Espyo	heh
2014-01-15 01:46:42	ThePikminMeister	i literally just fell asleep for a minute
2014-01-15 01:46:48	ThePikminMeister	and its only 8:46
2014-01-15 01:47:14	@PikFan	huh
2014-01-15 01:47:41	@PikFan	I can't find logs of something
2014-01-15 01:47:54	ThePikminMeister	what?
2014-01-15 01:47:56	ThePikminMeister	logs?
2014-01-15 01:48:36	ThePikminMeister	wood you like me to get you some logs?
2014-01-15 01:48:37	ThePikminMeister	xD
2014-01-15 01:48:44	@PikFan	lol
2014-01-15 01:49:02	@PikFan	specifically, logs of #pikipedia on Christmas morning
2014-01-15 01:49:13	ThePikminMeister	oh
2014-01-15 01:49:18	@PikFan	hmmmmm
2014-01-15 01:49:31	@PikFan	maybe it's because I was on my 3DS
2014-01-15 01:49:42	ThePikminMeister	hmmm
2014-01-15 01:49:46	ThePikminMeister	christmas
2014-01-15 01:50:13	ThePikminMeister	i was up at 12 am telling all of the active users merry christmas
2014-01-15 01:50:20	ThePikminMeister	although donopik never replied
2014-01-15 01:50:44	@PikFan	I wonder what happened to him
2014-01-15 01:50:49	ThePikminMeister	me too
2014-01-15 01:51:25	ThePikminMeister	he went on pikminopedia a month ago and said he was back from his long vacation
2014-01-15 01:51:31	ThePikminMeister	haven't heard from him since
2014-01-15 01:51:40	@PikFan	hm
2014-01-15 01:51:48	@PikFan	hey Espyo
2014-01-15 01:52:08	@PikFan	can you find logs of when I got on on Christmas
2014-01-15 01:52:10	@PikFan	>on on
2014-01-15 01:53:18	Espyo	heh
2014-01-15 01:53:21	Espyo	sure thing
2014-01-15 01:53:28	@PikFan	thank you
2014-01-15 01:53:33	Espyo	what do you want in particular?
2014-01-15 01:53:39	@PikFan	like
2014-01-15 01:53:39	ThePikminMeister	apparently a while ago i messaged dono on pikminopedia asking about a new guild that would be kind of like the spotty bulbear
2014-01-15 01:53:54	@PikFan	when I got on and I said something like "I'm going to save Pikipedia"
2014-01-15 01:54:24	ThePikminMeister	LOL
2014-01-15 01:54:34	@PikFan	wait what
2014-01-15 01:54:46	@PikFan	...Pikminopedia has a guild of bulborbs?
2014-01-15 01:55:00	ThePikminMeister	not really...
2014-01-15 01:55:02	ThePikminMeister	ok yes
2014-01-15 01:55:08	ThePikminMeister	now that i thinm about it
2014-01-15 01:55:47	ThePikminMeister	its all mixed around
2014-01-15 01:55:53	@PikFan	mm
2014-01-15 01:56:43	ThePikminMeister	red bulborbs remove spam/flaming, hairy bulborbs improve spelling/grammar, orange bulborbs improve quality of pages, and giant breadbugs welcome users
2014-01-15 01:57:02	@PikFan	hm
2014-01-15 01:57:34	Espyo	it's /still/ searching
2014-01-15 01:57:42	@PikFan	...still?
2014-01-15 01:57:45	Espyo	I made a small script to search for search terms in Mibbit logs, instead of going the long way
2014-01-15 01:57:52	Espyo	but it takes forever to do any— oh, finally
2014-01-15 01:58:00	@PikFan	oh
2014-01-15 01:58:05	Espyo	...first result is from today
2014-01-15 01:58:10	Espyo	WELL, that's predictable
2014-01-15 01:58:12	ThePikminMeister	so anyway, i just imagined myself siitng here at the chatroom and then i imagined purplepikminpower barging into my room and saying "i'm going to save pikipedia" in a weird accent. and he was dressed up as a knight...
2014-01-15 01:58:23	@PikFan	lolwu
2014-01-15 01:58:25	@PikFan	*lolwut
2014-01-15 02:00:32	ThePikminMeister	i dont even know
2014-01-15 02:01:19	ThePikminMeister	and my dad's phone was shutting off a lot for a while, and then he put paper in it, and bam - it worked again
2014-01-15 02:01:39	@PikFan	...he put /paper/in/it/ ?
2014-01-15 02:01:46	ThePikminMeister	no joke
2014-01-15 02:01:49	ThePikminMeister	i watched him do it
2014-01-15 02:01:51	Espyo	hm, I've found it
2014-01-15 02:01:56	Espyo	you want the logs up until when?
2014-01-15 02:02:09	@PikFan	oh, when we calmed down
2014-01-15 02:02:22	@PikFan	right now I'm cleaning my logs out
2014-01-15 02:03:24	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/q5tMyJSv
2014-01-15 02:04:17	ThePikminMeister	we need people with youtube accounts on this site
2014-01-15 02:04:23	ThePikminMeister	so they can spread the word
2014-01-15 02:04:54	Espyo	what do you mean?
2014-01-15 02:05:10	ThePikminMeister	...never mind
2014-01-15 02:05:25	@PikFan	you mean increase Pikipedia's popularity through YT?
2014-01-15 02:05:33	@PikFan	unfortunately
2014-01-15 02:05:47	@PikFan	MANY of the users at wikia have YT accounts
2014-01-15 02:05:57	@PikFan	...and they link, of course, to wikia
2014-01-15 02:06:13	@PikFan	heck, the wiki on wikia even has its own channel
2014-01-15 02:06:19	ThePikminMeister	gah
2014-01-15 02:06:29	ThePikminMeister	i have to make a video
2014-01-15 02:06:43	@PikFan	Espyo, remember this
2014-01-15 02:06:44	@PikFan	15:47:32: <Espyo> I mean, you point to the target, hold Z, and shake the nunchuck
2014-01-15 02:06:57	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-15 02:07:10	@PikFan	I wonder where you got it from
2014-01-15 02:07:36	ThePikminMeister	i just read the logs from christmas
2014-01-15 02:07:36	Espyo	somewhere, that's for sure
2014-01-15 02:08:35	@PikFan	also, speaking of Pikmin 3, I think I figured out a way to get the second part of the Garden of Hope done in 2 days
2014-01-15 02:08:55	@PikFan	so 17 day run
2014-01-15 02:09:01	ThePikminMeister	 17 day run?
2014-01-15 02:09:18	@PikFan	so if I can reduce the Tropical Wilds' total days to 4...
2014-01-15 02:09:25	@PikFan	...then a 16 day run will be possible
2014-01-15 02:09:27	ThePikminMeister	best i've done is 10
2014-01-15 02:09:31	ThePikminMeister	so far
2014-01-15 02:09:38	@PikFan	o_O
2014-01-15 02:09:46	@PikFan	are you a clone of Miles
2014-01-15 02:09:49	ThePikminMeister	no
2014-01-15 02:09:52	ThePikminMeister	not even close
2014-01-15 02:10:22	@PikFan	you must have followed his 10 day run, right
2014-01-15 02:10:25	ThePikminMeister	no
2014-01-15 02:10:33	@PikFan	well
2014-01-15 02:10:39	@PikFan	was it a 10 day all fruit?
2014-01-15 02:10:45	ThePikminMeister	no
2014-01-15 02:10:48	@PikFan	ah
2014-01-15 02:10:48	ThePikminMeister	 12 days with all fruit
2014-01-15 02:10:53	@PikFan	oh...
2014-01-15 02:11:07	@PikFan	how'd you manage that
2014-01-15 02:11:19	ThePikminMeister	i stared at my screen for hours
2014-01-15 02:11:26	ThePikminMeister	and finally figured out a hort route
2014-01-15 02:12:38	ThePikminMeister	i could have gotten 11 all fruit if i didnt waste an entire day on the sandbelching meerslug and then the next with carrying stuff back
2014-01-15 02:12:50	ThePikminMeister	but miles is way better than me
2014-01-15 02:13:03	@PikFan	actually 10 days is the minimum for all fruit
2014-01-15 02:14:10	@PikFan	you skipped the blue bridge in the Twilight River, right?
2014-01-15 02:14:35	ThePikminMeister	blue bridge?
2014-01-15 02:14:48	ThePikminMeister	the one leading to the pink onion?
2014-01-15 02:14:54	@PikFan	yeah, that one
2014-01-15 02:14:58	ThePikminMeister	no
2014-01-15 02:15:08	@PikFan	...
2014-01-15 02:15:14	ThePikminMeister	i got a bit of it and then threw my pikmin to the other side

2014-01-15 02:20:43	ThePikminMeister	it took him 32 days to beat it
2014-01-15 02:20:51	@PikFan	hah
2014-01-15 02:20:55	ThePikminMeister	but guess what
2014-01-15 02:21:06	@PikFan	?
2014-01-15 02:21:07	ThePikminMeister	he didnt even collect all of the fruit
2014-01-15 02:21:12	@PikFan	pfft
2014-01-15 02:22:19	ThePikminMeister	in pikmin 2 that same friend is on day 84
2014-01-15 02:22:33	ThePikminMeister	he hasnt even finished paying the debt

2014-01-15 02:22:48	ThePikminMeister	he still has 50% more to go
2014-01-15 02:22:57	@PikFan	clearly your friend

2014-01-15 02:30:05	Espyo	ThePikminMeister: I took a look at your game on the wiki, I think you'll have no problem fitting it in on the engine
2014-01-15 02:30:23	Espyo	I'm more worried about games that have specific gameplay mechanics, because those can't be edited in easily
2014-01-15 02:30:28	ThePikminMeister	we/'' see
2014-01-15 02:30:35	ThePikminMeister	the final boss of my game might be hard

2014-01-15 19:50:32	ThePikminMeister	Hello
2014-01-15 19:50:49	Espyo	hey
2014-01-15 19:51:03	ThePikminMeister	Just got home from school
2014-01-15 19:51:16	ThePikminMeister	Now I'm free to think of ideas
2014-01-15 19:52:57	Espyo	heh, good
2014-01-15 19:53:18	ThePikminMeister	So I was thinking
2014-01-15 19:53:39	ThePikminMeister	Will it be possible to be able to control a pikmin for a minor part of a game?
2014-01-15 19:56:38	Espyo	I have no plans for making particularly that, but if the Pikmin isn't meant to do anything too important, then yes
2014-01-15 19:57:09	ThePikminMeister	All it is is a pikmin walking through a maze
2014-01-15 19:57:11	Espyo	of course, I can always change one or two settings to fit the mechanics of an individual game
2014-01-15 19:57:18	Espyo	shouldn't be hard, no
2014-01-15 19:57:29	Espyo	but again, don't limit yourself by the engine
2014-01-15 19:58:20	ThePikminMeister	I was thinking of a part where you control a pikmin and run through a maze
2014-01-15 19:58:52	Espyo	right
2014-01-15 19:59:10	ThePikminMeister	And then you pick up a Bombrock and throw it at a wall to destroy it and allow Olimar to pass through
2014-01-15 20:03:22	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-15 20:03:26	Espyo	well, it shouldn't be too hard
2014-01-15 20:04:10	@J	.
2014-01-15 20:05:02	Espyo	hey
2014-01-15 20:07:26	@J	so, there's a model viewer we can use on the Pikmin 2 files, right?
2014-01-15 20:08:27	Espyo	.../what/
2014-01-15 20:08:38	Espyo	I'm messing about with the font graphic for the engine
2014-01-15 20:08:44	Espyo	going to use Pikmin 2's font, finally
2014-01-15 20:08:51	Espyo	but every change I make, the engine crashes
2014-01-15 20:09:00	Espyo	probably some glyph that doesn't have the right coordinates
2014-01-15 20:09:12	Espyo	I double checked, and everything was fine
2014-01-15 20:09:14	Espyo	but it still crashed
2014-01-15 20:09:18	Espyo	so I decided to start in debug mode
2014-01-15 20:09:20	Espyo	...and it didn't crash
2014-01-15 20:09:26	Espyo	decided to start normally again
2014-01-15 20:09:29	Espyo	doesn't crash any more
2014-01-15 20:09:32	ThePikminMeister	How do you type so fast?
2014-01-15 20:09:57	@J	yeah, I fixed something today by running it 10 times
2014-01-15 20:09:58	Espyo	loads of practice
2014-01-15 20:10:03	ThePikminMeister	Lol
2014-01-15 20:10:13	Espyo	ok, I can see that's the recurring problem-solver-solution of the day...
2014-01-15 20:10:25	Espyo	programs are rising against us
2014-01-15 20:10:30	Espyo	and the only way to fix them is to run them several times
2014-01-15 20:10:48	Espyo	...crashed again
2014-01-15 20:11:16	ThePikminMeister	Brb
2014-01-15 20:11:22	Espyo	wait... this isn't related to the font
2014-01-15 20:11:32	Espyo	something on the pellet configuration file is crashing
2014-01-15 20:11:36	Espyo	...*gulp* at random
2014-01-15 20:11:49	ThePikminMeister	I'm going to post the laser clam clamp concept onto a page

2014-01-15 21:10:49	@J	the exe on the website is for bmdview1
2014-01-15 21:10:52	@J	this is bmdview2

2014-01-15 21:11:41	@J	yeah, I don't have any text

2014-01-15 21:12:59	@J	hmm, wait
2014-01-15 21:13:09	@J	where did you get your exe?
2014-01-15 21:13:41	@J	because bmdview1 seems to just dump a load of dds files
2014-01-15 21:13:55	Espyo	http://www.amnoid.de/gc/ here
2014-01-15 21:14:17	@J	where there
2014-01-15 21:14:38	Espyo	wait, that links to bmdview1...
2014-01-15 21:14:42	@J	yeah
2014-01-15 21:15:08	Espyo	http://code.google.com/p/bmdview2/ here then
2014-01-15 21:17:12	@J	the link there is dead
2014-01-15 21:17:57	@J	I found a megaupload link (obviously dead now) that may have had the Windows version
2014-01-15 21:18:35	Espyo	in that case I might just have the last executable existing
2014-01-15 21:18:41	@J	hah
2014-01-15 21:18:49	Espyo	leave me to my fantasy :(
2014-01-15 21:18:58	Espyo	anyway, off-topic, but what was that memory leak finder for C++=
2014-01-15 21:18:59	Espyo	*?
2014-01-15 21:19:17	Espyo	with debugging, the memory is always initialized to 0, but when running normally, it's not
2014-01-15 21:19:22	Espyo	so that has to be the reason something's crashing
2014-01-15 21:19:25	Espyo	but it's so bizarre
2014-01-15 21:19:31	Espyo	it loads the data of a pellet just fine
2014-01-15 21:19:44	Espyo	 /except/ for the number of seeds to hand out when the onion doesn't match
2014-01-15 21:19:52	@J	Valgrind
2014-01-15 21:19:54	Espyo	and of course I can't figure out why, because I can't debug
2014-01-15 21:19:56	Espyo	thanks
2014-01-15 21:20:39	Espyo	err, didn't this use to work on windows?
2014-01-15 21:21:10	@J	what, Valgrind?
2014-01-15 21:21:33	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-15 21:22:03	@J	hmm, I guess I never knew if it did
2014-01-15 21:22:29	@J	'In particular Windows is not under consideration here because porting to it would require so many changes it would almost be a separate project.'
2014-01-15 21:22:49	Espyo	obviously, I cannot even begin to think about blaming them
2014-01-15 21:22:53	Espyo	never questioned that
2014-01-15 21:23:06	Espyo	but I asked because maybe there was a windows version somewhere and I was blind
2014-01-15 21:24:06	@J	http://code.google.com/p/drmemory/
2014-01-15 21:24:07	@J	?

2014-01-16 20:10:07	Espyo	so that's why he said a timed random message here
2014-01-16 20:10:15	Espyo	Testyo makes just as much sense as Pikmin 2, really

2014-01-16 20:31:37	@J	...why does Skype start abbreviating names about a kilometre before it needs to?
2014-01-16 20:32:56	Espyo	y/ r just imply. that ab. r a bad thing 2 do
2014-01-16 20:33:55	@J	not sure what you even
2014-01-16 20:34:11	Espyo	ugh, making me type without abbreviating
2014-01-16 20:34:26	Espyo	I said you were just implying that abbreviating is a bad thing to do
2014-01-16 20:34:42	@J	yes
2014-01-16 20:34:49	@J	yes it is
2014-01-16 20:34:56	Espyo	wait, looks like it's just a you thing
2014-01-16 20:35:03	Espyo	it's putting ellipsis in the right place for me
2014-01-16 20:35:24	@J	mm, probably
2014-01-16 20:35:43	Espyo	funny thing, there's this group chat with 3 people
2014-01-16 20:35:45	Espyo	one of them left
2014-01-16 20:35:52	Espyo	so now it just says Thomas, ...
2014-01-16 20:35:58	Espyo	instead of me, Thomas, and the third person
2014-01-16 20:36:04	Espyo	and that's not even an abbreviation
2014-01-16 20:36:09	Espyo	that's the full name of the group now
2014-01-16 20:36:16	Espyo	Skype ALSO doesn't make much sense
2014-01-16 20:36:18	@J	I mean, if I drag the separator across to where the full name ends, I see just 3 letters
2014-01-16 20:36:22	@J	out of 13
2014-01-16 20:36:26	Espyo	don't even get me started on what happens if somebody leaves a group voice call
2014-01-16 20:36:35	Espyo	ok, definitely a you thing
2014-01-16 20:37:36	@J	Skype for Linux is at 4.2
2014-01-16 20:38:19	Espyo	 6.11.(loads of numbers), for me
2014-01-16 20:39:14	@J	sounds about right
2014-01-16 20:47:38	@J	so, a world has a 'graphics', which is the collection of graphics arranged on the screen
2014-01-16 20:47:52	@J	wait ,let me check a thing
2014-01-16 20:48:59	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-16 20:49:06	@J	okay, since when does Skype show messages in a popup and how do I turn it off?
2014-01-16 20:49:28	@J	never mind, found it
2014-01-16 20:50:46	@J	right
2014-01-16 20:51:27	@J	so, currently, to resize the window, you set the size in the config (conf.RES_W = (w, h)) and call game.refresh_display()
2014-01-16 20:52:03	@J	and that sets the world.graphics to draw to the new screen
2014-01-16 20:52:21	@J	now, do you think it makes sense for world.graphics.resize(w, h) to resize the game window?
2014-01-16 20:52:46	@J	or world.graphics.crop(), etc. - any transform that changes its size
2014-01-16 20:53:00	Espyo	I don't actually think it makes too much sense
2014-01-16 20:53:04	@J	(a world.graphics is a GraphicsManager which is a Graphic, so it's transformable)
2014-01-16 20:53:12	Espyo	besides, if it doesn't mess with the window, that would allow you to have viewports
2014-01-16 20:53:53	@J	you can do that by creating a GraphicsManager and adding it to world.graphics
2014-01-16 20:54:02	@J	since a manager is a Graphic
2014-01-16 20:54:11	Espyo	hmmm
2014-01-16 20:54:43	Espyo	still, when you resize world.graphics, which is inside a GraphicsManager, it'll still resize the window
2014-01-16 20:57:00	@J	what?
2014-01-16 20:57:11	@J	wait, I'm saying that's what I _could_ do
2014-01-16 20:57:23	@J	that's what I was asking for your opinion on
2014-01-16 20:57:24	Espyo	ah
2014-01-16 20:57:58	Espyo	wait, I'm lost then
2014-01-16 20:58:16	@J	hmm
2014-01-16 20:58:17	Espyo	you're asking whether resizing world.graphics should resize the game's window
2014-01-16 20:58:46	Espyo	if you put world.graphics inside a GraphicsManager
2014-01-16 20:58:51	Espyo	and then have other graphics
2014-01-16 20:59:07	Espyo	resizing world.graphics' resize of the window will not be a good thing
2014-01-16 20:59:30	@J	hmm
2014-01-16 20:59:37	@J	then you're doing it wrong
2014-01-16 20:59:47	@J	world.graphics is what will be shown on the screen
2014-01-16 21:00:02	@J	you add things to it, you don't add it to other things
2014-01-16 21:00:08	@J	because those won't be shown anywhere
2014-01-16 21:00:22	@J	unless you just want to arrange them then save an image

2014-01-16 21:01:16	Espyo	why would you want to put it in a GraphicsManager?

2014-01-16 21:01:36	Pikpikmate	I can actually access Pikipedia at my school for now, so I can be on even more
2014-01-16 21:01:54	Espyo	hurray
2014-01-16 21:02:03	Espyo	you can access the IRC outside of Pikipedia as well

2014-01-16 21:03:01	Espyo	(Internet Relay Chat)

2014-01-16 21:10:53	Pikpikmate	Huh
2014-01-16 21:11:16	Pikpikmate	How relative are the health points in Pikmin compared to Pikmin 2's?
2014-01-16 21:12:40	Pikpikmate	Because the Dwarf Bulbear's HP in Pikmin 1 is apparently only 180, while in Pikmin 2 they have 500 HP
2014-01-16 21:13:04	Pikpikmate	And the articles states they're "weaker" and take only one Pikmin thrown on top to kill them now
2014-01-16 21:13:09	Pikpikmate	article*
2014-01-16 21:15:41	Pikpikmate	You know what I mean?
2014-01-16 21:16:32	@J	hmm
2014-01-16 21:16:54	@J	well, the throw on the top is probably a special attack, so it doesn't mean much for hitpoints
2014-01-16 21:17:07	Pikpikmate	I know that much
2014-01-16 21:17:24	Pikpikmate	But I mean like, how much damage Pikmin do in 1 compared to 2
2014-01-16 21:17:27	@J	I guess the only way of comparing between the games is to also compare Pikmin attack speeds and strengths
2014-01-16 21:17:36	@J	I don't have those numbers, but Miles probably does
2014-01-16 21:17:53	Pikpikmate	The article doesn't state that in particular, does it?
2014-01-16 21:18:01	Pikpikmate	I mean for Pikmin damages
2014-01-16 21:18:38	Pikpikmate	Red Pikmin it says 15 damage, but doesn't clarify which game
2014-01-16 21:18:47	Pikpikmate	Unless it's the same for both
2014-01-16 21:19:06	@J	hmm, they might be the same for both
2014-01-16 21:19:49	Pikpikmate	If so that's a big health change for the Bulbears, and I don't think they should be considered "weaker" in 2
2014-01-16 21:21:58	@J	mm, true
2014-01-16 21:22:47	@J	the one-hit-kill does make them weaker, though
2014-01-16 21:22:53	Pikpikmate	The article also states that Bulbears have two to three times as much Health as Red Dwarf Bulborbs, which is incorrect for 1 but not 2
2014-01-16 21:23:16	Pikpikmate	Yeah but they only have 180 health in 1, but 500 in 2
2014-01-16 21:23:29	Pikpikmate	Which is a dramatic change
2014-01-16 21:24:23	@J	it's worth checking all the numbers, but they're probably correct
2014-01-16 21:25:22	Pikpikmate	And how much damage do Captains do?
2014-01-16 21:25:49	Pikpikmate	The rocket punch does more than the regular punch as well
2014-01-16 21:27:08	Espyo	back
2014-01-16 21:27:17	Espyo	but
2014-01-16 21:27:19	Espyo	I didn't suggest that
2014-01-16 21:27:20	Espyo	you did
2014-01-16 21:27:30	Espyo	 20:53	J	you can do that by creating a GraphicsManager and adding it to world.graphics
2014-01-16 21:27:37	Espyo	unless that means a GraphicsManager INSIDE world.graphics
2014-01-16 21:27:46	Espyo	I read that as GraphicsManager on top of world.graphics
2014-01-16 21:27:48	Espyo	makes sense then
2014-01-16 21:27:51	@J	yeah, inside
2014-01-16 21:27:55	@J	like you would add a graphic
2014-01-16 21:27:57	Espyo	still not quite so sure about it resizing the window
2014-01-16 21:28:02	Espyo	what else does world do?
2014-01-16 21:28:06	@J	all the stuff
2014-01-16 21:28:15	@J	it's your game state
2014-01-16 21:28:32	@J	entities, graphics, lets you play audio
2014-01-16 21:28:33	Espyo	I was thinking some days ago
2014-01-16 21:28:40	Espyo	we should have a tooltip on top of the HP values
2014-01-16 21:28:44	Espyo	and add reference values
2014-01-16 21:29:13	Espyo	because let's be honest, if somebody says an enemy in Pikmin 3 has 800 HP, that doesn't mean anything for somebody who never played it
2014-01-16 21:29:34	Espyo	didn't Dwarfs die in one-hit KOs in Pikmin 1 as well
2014-01-16 21:29:35	Espyo	*?
2014-01-16 21:29:42	Pikpikmate	Bulbears?
2014-01-16 21:29:49	Espyo	could swear they did, I remember squashing some in Challenge Mode on The Final Trial
2014-01-16 21:30:06	Pikpikmate	If you throw a Pikmin on top of them it only takes half their health bar
2014-01-16 21:30:13	Espyo	in that case, resizing should resize the window, yeah
2014-01-16 21:30:23	Espyo	wha
2014-01-16 21:30:37	Pikpikmate	In Pikmin 2 it kills them instantly
2014-01-16 21:30:40	Espyo	I don't remember at all seeing any enemy lose half their HP by having a Pikmin thrown on their back
2014-01-16 21:30:56	Pikpikmate	It's at least half, I know it's not a one hit kill
2014-01-16 21:31:22	Espyo	crazy
2014-01-16 21:31:27	Pikpikmate	"are able to stand more than one Pikmin thrown directly on top of it"
2014-01-16 21:31:31	Pikpikmate	As the article states
2014-01-16 21:31:39	Espyo	b-but
2014-01-16 21:32:01	Miles	Pikmin do the same damage in both games
2014-01-16 21:32:07	Pikpikmate	Oh, okay
2014-01-16 21:32:10	Pikpikmate	Thanks
2014-01-16 21:32:20	Pikpikmate	What about Captains' damage output?
2014-01-16 21:32:50	Miles	10 in Pikmin 1, 7.5 default in Pikmin 2 and 18.75 for the Rocket Punch attack IIRC
2014-01-16 21:33:00	Miles	Pretty sure it's a 2.5 multiplier
2014-01-16 21:33:28	Miles	And then 3 in Pikmin 3
2014-01-16 21:33:29	Miles	Why
2014-01-16 21:33:48	Pikpikmate	It sounds like it's becoming more useless each game
2014-01-16 21:34:07	@J	because fiddling with numbers is an easy way to avoid doing the hard bits when making a game
2014-01-16 21:34:11	Miles	Nah, the rocket punch makes it really powerful
2014-01-16 21:34:14	@J	I thought he meant 3x multiplier
2014-01-16 21:35:07	Pikpikmate	I always loved the punch
2014-01-16 21:35:08	Miles	Charlie is weaker than a Winged Pikmin
2014-01-16 21:35:11	Miles	That's just pathetic
2014-01-16 21:35:52	Espyo	hah
2014-01-16 21:36:18	Pikpikmate	Does Pikmin 3 have like, multiplayer?
2014-01-16 21:36:37	Espyo	Bingo Battle
2014-01-16 21:36:46	Espyo	not sure about co-op challenge mode, though
2014-01-16 21:36:53	Pikpikmate	They better
2014-01-16 21:37:06	Pikpikmate	It took them 9 years to make it they better have a great multiplayer
2014-01-16 21:38:11	Pikpikmate	But more importantly, these damage outputs for Captains should be added to the article
2014-01-16 21:38:36	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-16 21:38:39	Espyo	probably [[Leader]]
2014-01-16 21:39:41	Miles	You can do co-op in Mission Mode yeah
2014-01-16 21:40:27	Pikpikmate	Good, since coop challenge mode in Pikmin 2 was the most fun ever
2014-01-16 21:40:45	Pikpikmate	Yet I never perfected every one
2014-01-16 21:40:57	Pikpikmate	Around 7 or 8 I could never perfect
2014-01-16 21:43:38	Pikpikmate	Oh, and is Olimar's rocket punch actually slower than the president's?
2014-01-16 21:43:46	Pikpikmate	Or Louie's
2014-01-16 21:43:58	Espyo	well, punches in general are slower if you're standing still
2014-01-16 21:44:32	Pikpikmate	Yeah, but I remember the Ship saying since Olimar has shoulder problems or something, he attacks with the rocket punch slower
2014-01-16 21:44:46	Espyo	I really don't remember that
2014-01-16 21:46:23	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Brute_Knuckles#Sales_Pitch
2014-01-16 21:46:24	Espyo	oh
2014-01-16 21:46:28	Espyo	but... that implies something different
2014-01-16 21:46:39	Pikpikmate	Yeah, nevermind
2014-01-16 21:46:47	Pikpikmate	I think I read it wrong when I was younger
2014-01-16 21:47:31	Pikpikmate	I think I just assumed Olimar had shoulder problems and it affected the speed of his punching, since it was written for that treasure
2014-01-16 21:53:58	Pikpikmate	Anyways
2014-01-16 21:54:41	Pikpikmate	I'll fix the information in the Dwarf Bulbear article
2014-01-16 21:56:11	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-16 21:57:02	Pikpikmate	How should the damage output for Captains be made?
2014-01-16 21:59:33	Pikpikmate	In the Leader article
2014-01-16 22:08:09	@J	not infoboxes?
2014-01-16 22:10:56	Pikpikmate	I guess that'd work
2014-01-16 22:12:27	Pikpikmate	I have to say though, this wiki's really well done compared to a lot of others
2014-01-16 22:13:26	Pikpikmate	I've only been here a little while, but a lot of stuff's been done well despite the lack of activity around here
2014-01-16 22:13:41	Espyo	thanks, we try to keep up to shape
2014-01-16 22:13:48	Espyo	still not as well made as the likes of Bulbapedia
2014-01-16 22:14:01	Pikpikmate	Bulbapedia's completely different though
2014-01-16 22:14:17	Pikpikmate	They have like a million people since the games are super mainstream popular
2014-01-16 22:14:27	Espyo	true
2014-01-16 22:14:57	Pikpikmate	I might be "getting" Pikmin 3 soon
2014-01-16 22:15:20	Pikpikmate	My first priority after beating the game and stuff is adding information
2014-01-16 22:15:42	Pikpikmate	It should be a couple of weeks, but I'll eventually be adding what I can
2014-01-16 22:16:41	Espyo	right
2014-01-16 22:17:11	Pikpikmate	I'm just disappointed the popularity surge didn't happen like I anticipated
2014-01-16 22:17:53	Pikpikmate	I expected there to be a lot more people here after Pikmin 3 got released, and everybody'd be talking about it
2014-01-16 22:18:35	Pikpikmate	But not too much information about Pikmin 3 is really even here yet, so I dunno
2014-01-16 22:18:56	Pikpikmate	We're kind of behind since the game's been out for a long time already
2014-01-16 22:19:39	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-16 22:19:49	Pikpikmate	I'm just upset it got released for the Wii U
2014-01-16 22:20:02	Pikpikmate	If it was for Wii I would've gotten it release day
2014-01-16 22:21:25	Espyo	same
2014-01-16 22:21:33	Pikpikmate	Could you edit the leader page?
2014-01-16 22:21:46	Pikpikmate	I want to test something in Pikmin 2
2014-01-16 22:21:57	Pikpikmate	And add it to an article that has a To Do
2014-01-16 22:22:37	Pikpikmate	I'll just do them both if you're busy though
2014-01-16 22:23:16	Espyo	what exactly do you need?
2014-01-16 22:24:09	Pikpikmate	Miles stated the damage outputs for the Leaders in all the Pikmin games
2014-01-16 22:24:20	Pikpikmate	"10 in Pikmin 1, 7.5 default in Pikmin 2 and 18.75 for the Rocket Punch attack IIRC"
2014-01-16 22:24:34	Pikpikmate	"then 3 in Pikmin 3"
2014-01-16 22:24:45	Pikpikmate	It should be added to the page
2014-01-16 22:27:03	Pikpikmate	I think J suggested an infobox
2014-01-16 22:27:37	Espyo	oh right
2014-01-16 22:27:41	Espyo	but what about the ToDo?
2014-01-16 22:31:28	Pikpikmate	That's what I'm doing
2014-01-16 22:31:35	Pikpikmate	I have to check the Submerged Castle stuff
2014-01-16 22:31:38	Espyo	hm
2014-01-16 22:32:13	Pikpikmate	I checked made sure 5 minutes was correct for the Waterwraith, now I need to check how many bombrocks there are on Sublevel 4
2014-01-16 22:32:24	Espyo	right
2014-01-16 22:32:30	Pikpikmate	And 15 seconds for the Waterwraith on the last sublevel
2014-01-16 22:32:42	Espyo	but I thought he only spawned if you stepped on the arena
2014-01-16 22:33:13	Espyo	wait, we should confirm the values before adding them

2014-01-16 22:35:34	Pikpikmate	Oh, alright
2014-01-16 22:46:15	Pikpikmate	Where was this 6 found from?
2014-01-16 22:46:27	Pikpikmate	I encountered 9 bombrocks
2014-01-16 22:46:51	Pikpikmate	A lot of explosives I tell ya
2014-01-16 22:48:43	Espyo	reading of the games' files
2014-01-16 22:48:47	Espyo	it's... very hard
2014-01-16 22:48:50	Espyo	which sublevel are you on about?
2014-01-16 22:53:33	Pikpikmate	Sublevel 4
2014-01-16 22:53:35	Pikpikmate	And now I got 10
2014-01-16 22:54:24	Pikpikmate	I'm a bit agitated now
2014-01-16 22:54:27	Espyo	:/
2014-01-16 22:54:33	Espyo	Submerged Castle, right?
2014-01-16 22:54:33	Pikpikmate	I know I didn't miss any
2014-01-16 22:54:37	Pikpikmate	Sublevel 4
2014-01-16 22:54:38	Pikpikmate	Yeah
2014-01-16 22:54:51	Pikpikmate	Loads of Bombrocks and Volatile Dweevils

2014-01-16 22:56:05	Espyo	http://pastebin.com/9fCJfr9Y
2014-01-16 22:56:08	Espyo	here's the problem
2014-01-16 22:56:22	Espyo	most of the time, it's the object's name, followed by the amount, divided by 10
2014-01-16 22:56:28	Espyo	most of the time
2014-01-16 22:56:37	Espyo	 31 and 31 = I have no idea
2014-01-16 22:56:39	Espyo	so I just put 6...
2014-01-16 22:56:58	Espyo	even if it's like... I don't know... 3 + randomly 1
2014-01-16 22:57:09	Espyo	it still doesn't make sense, 4 + 4 = 8, and you said you saw 9
2014-01-16 22:57:35	Pikpikmate	I'm gunna have to keep redoing this sublevel to see what I come up with
2014-01-16 22:57:47	Pikpikmate	And the Waterwraith is glitching himself somehow
2014-01-16 22:58:05	Pikpikmate	Runnin into a wall
2014-01-16 22:59:24	Espyo	heh
2014-01-16 22:59:26	Espyo	that's know
2014-01-16 22:59:27	Espyo	*n
2014-01-16 23:01:28	Pikpikmate	I had that happen with a Beetle in the first game the other day
2014-01-16 23:01:48	Pikpikmate	I never thought it could happen, but all it did was run against the wall until it went back in the ground
2014-01-16 23:02:47	Espyo	Beetle?
2014-01-16 23:02:52	Espyo	you'll have to disambiguate

2014-01-16 23:08:11	Espyo	oh
2014-01-16 23:08:16	Espyo	yeah, that happens
2014-01-16 23:20:53	Pikpikmate	Alright
2014-01-16 23:20:56	Pikpikmate	I believe it's 10
2014-01-16 23:21:01	Pikpikmate	I got 10 twice in a row
2014-01-16 23:21:12	Pikpikmate	And 9 last time, so I must've just missed one last time
2014-01-16 23:23:48	Pikpikmate	But it says 6 in the game's codes?
2014-01-16 23:24:14	Espyo	it doesn't say 6
2014-01-16 23:24:19	Espyo	it says "31" and "31"...
2014-01-16 23:25:20	Pikpikmate	That's really odd
2014-01-16 23:25:30	Pikpikmate	 10 doesn't even go into 31 evenly
2014-01-16 23:26:38	Pikpikmate	Should I add 10 to the page?
2014-01-16 23:26:47	Pikpikmate	Or should we just wait on it?
2014-01-16 23:27:26	Espyo	add 10, please
2014-01-16 23:27:28	Espyo	it's probably 10
2014-01-16 23:28:08	Pikpikmate	Alright
2014-01-16 23:28:17	Espyo	I really can't figure out any operation, attribute, transformation, anything
2014-01-16 23:28:22	Espyo	that can match two "31"s into a 10
2014-01-16 23:28:47	Pikpikmate	I'm adding everything in one go at the end, the last thing I need to do is figure out the boss Waterwraith's spawn time or somethin
2014-01-16 23:29:13	Pikpikmate	But yeah, I have no clue how 31 can possibly relate to 10
2014-01-16 23:29:58	Pikpikmate	Afk, shower
2014-01-16 23:33:12	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-17 00:01:05	Pikpikmate	Back, and what does the article mean by the Waterwraith falling "on its own"?
2014-01-17 00:03:51	Pikpikmate	You have to stand under it to make it appear don't you?
2014-01-17 00:08:34	Pikpikmate	Cause I really don't know what to look for
2014-01-17 00:09:07	Espyo	I really don't even know what's truth any more
2014-01-17 00:10:34	Pikpikmate	He spawns in the middle of the arena when you walk there
2014-01-17 00:10:55	Pikpikmate	There's no timer or anything, he just starts falling the second you go there
2014-01-17 00:11:39	Espyo	but does he fall if you wait 15 seconds?
2014-01-17 00:11:58	Pikpikmate	I waited like 2 minutes
2014-01-17 00:12:09	Pikpikmate	In the arena, outside the arena, got the Purple Pikmin and waited
2014-01-17 00:12:10	Espyo	let me check the files
2014-01-17 00:12:22	Espyo	yeah, the files say 15 seconds
2014-01-17 00:12:24	Pikpikmate	He only appeared when I went to the center of the arena
2014-01-17 00:12:30	Espyo	hm
2014-01-17 00:12:35	Espyo	that makes the timer unused
2014-01-17 00:12:48	Pikpikmate	Maybe you have to wait 15 seconds after you reach the floor?
2014-01-17 00:13:09	Pikpikmate	And then you can trigger him?
2014-01-17 00:14:24	Pikpikmate	No
2014-01-17 00:14:38	Pikpikmate	He just comes no matter what when you walk onto the center of the arena
2014-01-17 00:14:53	Pikpikmate	So it's probably an unused timer
2014-01-17 00:15:54	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-17 00:21:22	Pikpikmate	Okay, I corrected the bomb-rock number
2014-01-17 00:21:33	Pikpikmate	And I'll just delete all the To-Dos, right?
2014-01-17 00:24:03	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-17 00:24:09	Espyo	oh, did you mention the timer wasn't used?
2014-01-17 00:24:26	Pikpikmate	Should that go in Trivia?
2014-01-17 00:24:37	Pikpikmate	I mean, it's not too big of a deal
2014-01-17 00:24:43	Pikpikmate	I don't think
2014-01-17 00:28:36	Espyo	yeah, trivia
2014-01-17 00:30:53	Espyo	wait, I just thought of something
2014-01-17 00:31:01	Espyo	if somebody defeats the Waterwraith on an earlier floor
2014-01-17 00:31:10	Espyo	and then defeats it on another one
2014-01-17 00:31:12	Espyo	you know, with hakcs
2014-01-17 00:31:13	Espyo	*hacks
2014-01-17 00:31:22	Espyo	chances are the 2nd+ battles aren't going to make it drop anything
2014-01-17 00:31:29	Espyo	think about it, it's how it works in the vanilla game
2014-01-17 00:31:34	Espyo	you fight a boss the first time, it drops something
2014-01-17 00:31:39	Espyo	you fight it again, it doesn't drop anything any more
2014-01-17 00:32:59	Pikpikmate	Is the coding similar though?
2014-01-17 00:34:18	Espyo	can't say
2014-01-17 00:34:21	Espyo	but it makes sense
2014-01-17 00:34:27	Espyo	let's pick another enemy
2014-01-17 00:35:09	Pikpikmate	It's kind of a unique situation though
2014-01-17 00:35:24	Espyo	in the files, the last sublevel of the Cavern of Chaos is programmed to have a Segmented Crawbster that has a Silencer inside
2014-01-17 00:35:37	Espyo	whenever you enter that sublevel, it spawns a Segmented Crawbster with a Silencer inside
2014-01-17 00:35:55	Espyo	except it doesn't drop it when you fight it the same time
2014-01-17 00:36:10	Espyo	when you defeat the "Segmented Crawbster with Silencer" enemy again, it doesn't drop it
2014-01-17 00:36:13	Pikpikmate	But we're talking about multiple sublevels with multiple bosses that are coded to drop the same treasure
2014-01-17 00:37:14	Espyo	well, they're still all known as "Waterwraith with Professional Noisemaker"
2014-01-17 00:37:26	Espyo	so as far as the game is concerned, they're the same object
2014-01-17 00:37:32	Espyo	different instances, but the same nonetheless
2014-01-17 00:37:40	Espyo	when you battle a normal boss several times, it's the same object
2014-01-17 00:37:45	Espyo	but different instances every time
2014-01-17 00:37:45	Pikpikmate	If that's the case, then you're probably right
2014-01-17 00:37:55	Espyo	and you still don't get one after the 2nd battle
2014-01-17 00:38:09	Espyo	but who knows, maybe it only saves the treasure, and hence, stops you from getting it again, when you exit the cave
2014-01-17 00:38:24	Pikpikmate	If it's considered the same entity then yeah, you might be right
2014-01-17 00:38:53	Pikpikmate	But you never really know for sure until you try it
2014-01-17 00:40:23	Pikpikmate	Anyways, I have to go now
2014-01-17 00:40:33	Pikpikmate	I'll try to work on the other To-Dos later
2014-01-17 00:40:39	Pikpikmate	See ya

2014-01-17 02:19:20	@PikFan	...then your real CpS is 1.8 tril?

2014-01-17 02:22:12	@PikFan	hmm

2014-01-17 20:26:45	@J	oh, right
2014-01-17 20:26:58	@J	you planned this
2014-01-17 20:31:43	Espyo	yup
2014-01-17 20:31:57	Espyo	in other news, I tried with all my might, but I'm stuck with windows 8
2014-01-17 20:32:09	Espyo	might as well lube up
2014-01-17 20:32:18	Espyo	heck, we'll all be forced to switch to 8 eventually
2014-01-17 20:32:28	Espyo	XP became uh... what's the word
2014-01-17 20:32:49	Espyo	deprecated
2014-01-17 20:32:54	Espyo	the same'll happen to 7
2014-01-17 20:32:56	Espyo	there's no fighting it
2014-01-17 20:34:07	@J	'we'
2014-01-17 20:34:21	@J	also, you could skip 8
2014-01-17 20:34:22	Espyo	we = those who have to use windows
2014-01-17 20:34:26	Espyo	true
2014-01-17 20:34:31	@J	people still using XP could skip Vista for 7
2014-01-17 20:34:36	Espyo	though I'm guessing that by this rate, 9 will be made of legos
2014-01-17 20:34:47	@J	what is this 'have to'?
2014-01-17 20:35:03	Espyo	Allegro barely works on windows
2014-01-17 20:35:13	Espyo	and it requires black wizardry to work on Linux
2014-01-17 20:35:22	Espyo	also, 90% of my Steam games don't run on Linux
2014-01-17 20:35:32	Espyo	plus a whole myriad of other applications I need all the time
2014-01-17 20:35:47	@J	replace all those 'need' with 'want'
2014-01-17 20:35:50	@J	but sure
2014-01-17 20:36:00	Espyo	but I just said
2014-01-17 20:36:06	Espyo	there's stuff that just doesn't work on Linux
2014-01-17 20:36:09	Espyo	so it's pretty much need
2014-01-17 20:36:30	Espyo	plus, the simplest things require the deepest skills to do on Linux
2014-01-17 20:36:38	Espyo	like changing the log-in sound
2014-01-17 20:37:31	@J	it's want in the same way that you want a better computer to play more resource-intensive games
2014-01-17 20:37:35	@J	also they're games
2014-01-17 20:38:00	Espyo	I need a better computer to play the likes of Cargo Commander
2014-01-17 20:38:04	Espyo	minimum requirements and all that
2014-01-17 20:38:17	Espyo	either way, dinner
2014-01-17 20:38:34	Espyo	the "wizardry to do day-to-day stuff" bit is still applicable though
2014-01-17 20:40:49	@J	mm, sometimes
2014-01-17 20:40:55	@J	it's applicable sometimes for Windows, though
2014-01-17 20:52:24	Espyo	wha? no way
2014-01-17 20:52:34	Espyo	day-to-day stuff is always easy to do and access
2014-01-17 20:52:49	Espyo	poorly made, most of the time, but it doesn't require a lot of skill

2014-01-17 21:29:52	Pikpikmate	Hey guys
2014-01-17 21:30:03	Pikpikmate	I can't stay long but I have something to report
2014-01-17 21:32:09	Pikpikmate	Yesterday I was playing my Pikmin 1 game and it played the Japanese Nintendo logo sound effect
2014-01-17 21:32:20	Pikpikmate	Instead of the regular one
2014-01-17 21:32:29	Espyo	hey
2014-01-17 21:33:26	Pikpikmate	I don't know why, but it just did
2014-01-17 21:33:39	Pikpikmate	Has that ever happened to anybody else?
2014-01-17 21:33:50	Espyo	whaaa
2014-01-17 21:34:07	Pikpikmate	It showed the regular Nintendo logo
2014-01-17 21:34:15	Pikpikmate	Red and not Blue like the Japanese one
2014-01-17 21:34:23	Pikpikmate	But it played the Japanese sound effect
2014-01-17 21:34:29	Pikpikmate	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z22toL6jg90
2014-01-17 21:35:04	Pikpikmate	It played that exact sound
2014-01-17 21:37:09	Espyo	what in the world
2014-01-17 21:37:18	Pikpikmate	I'm not kidding you
2014-01-17 21:37:46	Pikpikmate	I got on the chat this morning just to ask about it
2014-01-17 21:38:15	Pikpikmate	If I didn't recognize the sound effect I think I would've been scared to death
2014-01-17 21:38:39	Espyo	that's exactly my thought
2014-01-17 21:38:47	@J	did you maybe change your GameCube/Wii system language or something?
2014-01-17 21:39:37	Pikpikmate	No
2014-01-17 21:39:45	Pikpikmate	But I think my game might be a bit fried
2014-01-17 21:39:51	Pikpikmate	Recently it keeps like
2014-01-17 21:40:06	Pikpikmate	Giving me messages about not being able to read the disc
2014-01-17 21:40:15	Pikpikmate	But I've NEVER seen it do something so unusual before
2014-01-17 21:40:34	Pikpikmate	My guess is that instead of giving me the message it loaded the incorrect sound effect
2014-01-17 21:40:58	Pikpikmate	My Pikmin 1 is like 12 years old though, and the Gamecube's over 5
2014-01-17 21:41:26	Pikpikmate	But I never expected the game to act like that
2014-01-17 21:41:40	Pikpikmate	And it only happened once
2014-01-17 21:42:13	Pikpikmate	I could try and get proof later if ya want
2014-01-17 21:42:29	Pikpikmate	I don't know how redoable this kind of thing is though
2014-01-17 21:42:51	Espyo	really bizarre
2014-01-17 21:43:05	Espyo	well, you have seen alternate Nintendo logo sounds before, haven't you?
2014-01-17 21:43:15	Pikpikmate	What do you mean?
2014-01-17 21:43:58	Pikpikmate	In the NTSC version I have it only plays one sound effect at the Nintendo logo
2014-01-17 21:44:18	Pikpikmate	If it were to do anything differently, it'd be obvious enough to be significant
2014-01-17 21:44:26	Pikpikmate	it only plays*
2014-01-17 21:44:33	Pikpikmate	Wait, no that was correct
2014-01-17 21:44:53	Pikpikmate	But it played that Japanese sound effect instead of the NTSC version's
2014-01-17 21:45:09	Pikpikmate	No other versions
2014-01-17 21:46:35	Pikpikmate	Would you like me to try and record and reproduce it?
2014-01-17 21:49:47	Pikpikmate	It won't be any problem
2014-01-17 21:53:31	Pikpikmate	I need to go soon, I need input
2014-01-17 21:56:57	Espyo	sometimes
2014-01-17 21:57:05	Espyo	the Nintendo logo has a Pikmin sighing
2014-01-17 21:57:14	Espyo	or the noise they do when they discover a bomb-rock
2014-01-17 21:57:19	Espyo	but the Japanese sound?...
2014-01-17 21:57:21	Pikpikmate	I've heard of that
2014-01-17 21:57:29	Espyo	well, add the Japanese sound to the wiki, when you can
2014-01-17 21:57:31	Pikpikmate	I heard that's in the Latin America version or something
2014-01-17 21:57:41	Espyo	should be on the Trivia section of [[Pikmin (game)]]...?
2014-01-17 21:57:42	Pikpikmate	But I've never heard it before in my version
2014-01-17 21:57:46	Espyo	really?
2014-01-17 21:57:50	Espyo	well, I heard them, in PAL
2014-01-17 21:58:21	Pikpikmate	They wouldn't have like
2014-01-17 21:58:33	Pikpikmate	Extremely low percentages for certain sounds to play there
2014-01-17 21:58:43	Espyo	yeah, it's low
2014-01-17 21:58:50	Pikpikmate	This is the first time I've ever heard another sound play there in the NTSC version
2014-01-17 21:59:13	Pikpikmate	Let alone the Japanese version's creepy one
2014-01-17 22:00:54	Pikpikmate	If I heard that sound as a kid I'd be super scared
2014-01-17 22:01:13	Pikpikmate	I have to go now though

2014-01-18 02:54:00	Pikpikmate	AHA
2014-01-18 02:54:05	Pikpikmate	AHAHAHA
2014-01-18 02:54:13	Pikpikmate	After 20 minutes of resetting the game
2014-01-18 02:54:21	Pikpikmate	I got it to play a different sound effect
2014-01-18 02:55:07	Pikpikmate	And I recorded it
2014-01-18 02:56:18	Pikpikmate	It was the bomb-rock pick up sound effect
2014-01-18 02:56:33	Pikpikmate	I had to reset the game at least 40 times
2014-01-18 03:03:48	Espyo	hi
2014-01-18 03:03:53	Espyo	ah
2014-01-18 03:03:55	Espyo	there you go
2014-01-18 03:06:18	Espyo	which...
2014-01-18 03:06:28	Espyo	makes me terrified to start Pikmin 1
2014-01-18 03:06:48	Pikpikmate	Exactly
2014-01-18 03:06:53	Espyo	:(
2014-01-18 03:07:03	Espyo	but /whyyy/ does it exist?
2014-01-18 03:07:21	Pikpikmate	I think it's my game copy
2014-01-18 03:07:31	Pikpikmate	It's old, scratched, and just plain beat up
2014-01-18 03:08:06	Pikpikmate	But apparently it'll play the other region startup sounds after a million tries
2014-01-18 03:08:14	Pikpikmate	Which is really weird
2014-01-18 03:08:48	Pikpikmate	I figured what I said before was true, in that it picked another sound effect when it couldn't find the first one
2014-01-18 03:08:58	Pikpikmate	Which happened to be the Japanese startup
2014-01-18 03:09:15	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Easter_eggs#Nintendo_logo
2014-01-18 03:09:18	Pikpikmate	But seeing as it played a different startup leads me to believe something else
2014-01-18 03:09:34	Espyo	but it's really weird
2014-01-18 03:09:41	Espyo	scratched disks don't just act like that
2014-01-18 03:10:01	Espyo	I mean, changing the language to Japanese for the logo, and then the rest of the game being 100% normal
2014-01-18 03:10:53	Pikpikmate	Well, the only way to really find out is for somebody else to try it with their copy
2014-01-18 03:11:24	Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibYigJeFg0I
2014-01-18 03:11:42	Espyo	everything else only says Japan this Japan that
2014-01-18 03:11:51	Espyo	nothing about a random chance in the normal versions
2014-01-18 03:12:06	Pikpikmate	Exactly
2014-01-18 03:12:21	Pikpikmate	I personally think it's my copy being weird, but somebody else needs to try this
2014-01-18 03:12:40	Pikpikmate	Repeatedly resetting the game just for the Nintendo logo
2014-01-18 03:13:13	Pikpikmate	"*Notice that sometimes on USA version it emits Carry Bomb-rock voice or Idle Pikmin voice*"
2014-01-18 03:13:40	Pikpikmate	But it did that weird Japanese version once too
2014-01-18 03:13:41	Espyo	hmmm
2014-01-18 03:13:50	Espyo	you mean once, before the time today?
2014-01-18 03:13:54	Pikpikmate	And it's so weird since both of them took a WHOLE lot of time to do
2014-01-18 03:14:11	Espyo	also
2014-01-18 03:14:16	Pikpikmate	The first one was the Japanese sound effect which happened earlier after resetting the game to make it work correctly
2014-01-18 03:14:22	Espyo	the sound effect might not even be in the US disc, if it's JP only
2014-01-18 03:14:37	Pikpikmate	It's obviously on the disc if it played for me
2014-01-18 03:14:59	Pikpikmate	It's probably just unused, but somehow got used for that one time
2014-01-18 03:15:14	Espyo	also, you have the US version on the Wii, or GC?
2014-01-18 03:15:19	Espyo	right
2014-01-18 03:15:23	Pikpikmate	US version on GC
2014-01-18 03:15:28	Espyo	right
2014-01-18 03:15:36	Pikpikmate	I've had the game some 10 years
2014-01-18 03:15:38	Espyo	'cause that video you showed earlier today was from the the NPC! version
2014-01-18 03:15:53	Pikpikmate	I just showed it for an example of the sound effect
2014-01-18 03:16:20	Espyo	ah, right
2014-01-18 03:16:25	Pikpikmate	But somebody with another North American version of the game needs to attempt this
2014-01-18 03:16:45	Espyo	well, I have PAL, I can try as well
2014-01-18 03:16:50	Espyo	though... it'll take quite a while
2014-01-18 03:16:59	Pikpikmate	It took me 40 retries at least
2014-01-18 03:17:07	Espyo	for the Japanese sound?
2014-01-18 03:17:14	Pikpikmate	Either of them
2014-01-18 03:17:24	Pikpikmate	The North American version will only play one sound effect
2014-01-18 03:17:35	Espyo	also, the Pikmin 1 ISO I have is the US one
2014-01-18 03:17:42	Espyo	right, same with the PAL one
2014-01-18 03:17:46	Espyo	it picks a random one at startup
2014-01-18 03:17:49	Espyo	almost always "Pikmin!"
2014-01-18 03:18:11	Pikpikmate	Why would it pick a "random" one but the chances of the other ones happening would be so extremely slim?
2014-01-18 03:18:33	Pikpikmate	And it depends on region how likely one is more than the other
2014-01-18 03:19:44	Pikpikmate	At least 40 retries for me
2014-01-18 03:20:11	Espyo	because they're meant to be easter eggs
2014-01-18 03:23:30	Espyo	oh, was the logo's colored changed when you heard the Japanese sound?
2014-01-18 03:25:02	Pikpikmate	No
2014-01-18 03:25:22	Pikpikmate	It was still the same old Red
2014-01-18 03:31:11	Espyo	going to bed now
2014-01-18 03:31:16	Espyo	guess I'll try tomorrow on emulator

2014-01-18 19:58:42	Pikpikmate	Hai
2014-01-18 19:58:46	Espyo	hi
2014-01-18 20:08:59	Pikpikmate	Did you try to reproduce that sound, Espyo?
2014-01-18 20:09:09	Espyo	nope
2014-01-18 20:09:12	Espyo	been busy with the engine
2014-01-18 20:09:18	Pikpikmate	Oh, okay
2014-01-18 20:09:40	Espyo	ooh
2014-01-18 20:09:44	Espyo	 3rd reset: Wooo!
2014-01-18 20:10:00	Pikpikmate	 3rd reset?
2014-01-18 20:10:07	Pikpikmate	Man, really?
2014-01-18 20:10:11	Pikpikmate	It took me like 40
2014-01-18 20:11:45	Pikpikmate	I did get the Japanese sound too at one point, I think it'd be more interesting to try and get that one
2014-01-18 20:12:02	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-18 20:17:20	Espyo	in 100, I got 99 normal boots and 1 Woo! boot
2014-01-18 20:24:14	Pikpikmate	Yeah, it's so rare
2014-01-18 20:24:19	Pikpikmate	It doesn't make any sense
2014-01-18 20:24:38	Espyo	 199 normal, 1 Woo
2014-01-18 20:32:36	Pikpikmate	I didn't think it was THAT rare
2014-01-18 20:34:12	@J	hmm, pretty sure I've seen it plenty of times
2014-01-18 20:34:28	Pikpikmate	What about the Japanese startup sound?
2014-01-18 20:34:35	Espyo	haven't gotten yet
2014-01-18 20:34:37	Espyo	nor the sigh
2014-01-18 20:34:46	Espyo	well, I have gotten the sigh in an actual console
2014-01-18 20:34:48	Pikpikmate	And I think the Bomb-rock sound is more common on the PAL cersion
2014-01-18 20:34:51	Espyo	but not yet in this emulator experiment
2014-01-18 20:34:55	Espyo	might be
2014-01-18 20:35:06	Pikpikmate	NTSC only plays the "Pikmin!" one
2014-01-18 20:35:37	Pikpikmate	But recently we found that, very rarely plays something else
2014-01-18 20:35:47	@PikFan	I've heard Pikmin saying "Woo!" and sighing
2014-01-18 20:36:02	Pikpikmate	NTSC?
2014-01-18 20:36:06	@PikFan	yes
2014-01-18 20:36:15	Espyo	I've just had the Woo! on this emulator experiment right now
2014-01-18 20:36:15	Pikpikmate	GC version or Wii?
2014-01-18 20:36:17	Espyo	and it's NTSC
2014-01-18 20:36:19	@PikFan	GC
2014-01-18 20:36:34	Espyo	GC NTSC here, too
2014-01-18 20:36:36	Espyo	again, on the emulator
2014-01-18 20:36:41	Espyo	on the actual console, I have GC PAL
2014-01-18 20:36:48	Pikpikmate	It took me at least 40 restarts for it to make the Bomb-rock sound
2014-01-18 20:37:01	Pikpikmate	But the first one I heard was the Japanese startup by accident the other day
2014-01-18 20:37:05	@PikFan	...there's a bomb-rock sound?
2014-01-18 20:37:18	Pikpikmate	When the Pikmin pick up a bomb-rock and say like "Woo!"
2014-01-18 20:37:24	Pikpikmate	That sound
2014-01-18 20:37:48	Pikpikmate	The Japanese startup sound seems to be the rarest and most unusual that I heard
2014-01-18 20:37:59	@PikFan	oh, that
2014-01-18 20:38:13	@PikFan	hm, what's the Japanese sound?
2014-01-18 20:38:17	Pikpikmate	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z22toL6jg90 This is the Japanese sound
2014-01-18 20:38:43	@PikFan	what the
2014-01-18 20:38:50	@PikFan	can't say I've heard that
2014-01-18 20:38:53	Pikpikmate	Yeah, it's really weird
2014-01-18 20:39:14	Pikpikmate	It's supposed to only play in the Japanese version I think, but it played on my version once before
2014-01-18 20:39:46	@PikFan	...it sounds like they're saying "Wii U"
2014-01-18 20:40:05	Pikpikmate	A little bit
2014-01-18 20:41:08	Pikpikmate	But apparently Espyo just rebooted his game 200 times and only got one different sound effect in the NTSC version he has
2014-01-18 20:41:15	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-18 20:41:29	Pikpikmate	Which shows that different sound effects in that version seldom happen
2014-01-18 20:42:00	Pikpikmate	It took me over 40 retries to get it once
2014-01-18 20:42:08	@PikFan	>that version
2014-01-18 20:42:14	@PikFan	do you play the PAL version?
2014-01-18 20:42:22	Pikpikmate	I have NTSC
2014-01-18 20:42:35	@PikFan	ah, I see
2014-01-18 20:42:55	Pikpikmate	I thought it was my game being weird and glitched, but obviously not
2014-01-18 20:46:38	Pikpikmate	Maybe somebody like Gabriel would know why
2014-01-18 20:47:09	Espyo	 299 normal, 1 Woo
2014-01-18 20:47:25	Pikpikmate	Dang
2014-01-18 20:47:37	Espyo	it doesn't have to do directly with how many times you start the game, either
2014-01-18 20:47:45	Espyo	Dolphin doesn't report the game saving to the memory card when you turn it on
2014-01-18 20:47:56	Espyo	it could be like every 50th boot or something
2014-01-18 20:48:04	Espyo	but no, looks like it's completely random
2014-01-18 20:48:26	Pikpikmate	Completely random with other sound effects being severely less common
2014-01-18 20:49:01	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-18 20:55:57	Espyo	 399, 1
2014-01-18 20:56:03	Espyo	I'll stop at 500
2014-01-18 20:57:26	Pikpikmate	Okay
2014-01-18 20:58:26	@J	wait, you got 2 normal, then 1 woo, then 397 normal?
2014-01-18 20:58:38	Espyo	 399 normals, 1 woo
2014-01-18 20:58:45	Espyo	wait
2014-01-18 20:58:48	Espyo	yeah, that's it
2014-01-18 20:59:45	@J	that's crazy
2014-01-18 21:01:19	@PikFan	weird
2014-01-18 21:01:45	@PikFan	oh
2014-01-18 21:01:54	@PikFan	I remembered something
2014-01-18 21:01:54	Espyo	 499, 1
2014-01-18 21:01:58	Espyo	and that makes 500
2014-01-18 21:02:06	Pikpikmate	Wow
2014-01-18 21:02:08	Espyo	I'll download the PAL ISO and try that
2014-01-18 21:02:20	@PikFan	1 out of 500?
2014-01-18 21:02:26	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-18 21:02:28	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-18 21:02:37	Espyo	no sighs, no Japanese Wii-Us

2014-01-18 22:09:13	@PikFan	uh-oh
2014-01-18 22:09:26	@PikFan	Nintendo cut the Wii U sales forecast by 70
2014-01-18 22:09:33	@PikFan	%
2014-01-18 22:10:05	@PikFan	that doesn't bode well
2014-01-18 22:19:31	@PikFan	...I'm concerned about Nintendo's fate
2014-01-18 22:22:57	Espyo	a bit
2014-01-18 22:23:38	@PikFan	I can't imagine seeing Mario games on smartphones/tablets etc
2014-01-18 22:25:00	Pikpikmate	Nintendo's still doing better than Sony and Microsoft
2014-01-18 22:25:15	Pikpikmate	Nintendo could fail its next two consoles and still be fine
2014-01-18 22:25:30	@PikFan	isn't that because of all the money they have?
2014-01-18 22:25:36	Pikpikmate	They dominate the handheld market so bad it's no competition for the rest of them
2014-01-18 22:25:44	Pikpikmate	That too
2014-01-18 22:25:59	Pikpikmate	Nintendo's been so successful one console failing won't doom them
2014-01-18 22:26:27	@PikFan	I was reading an article how Nintendo should (or according to them, /need/) to improve their online services
2014-01-18 22:27:02	@PikFan	well... comments, really
2014-01-18 22:27:03	Pikpikmate	The Wii U had a terrible advertisement campaign
2014-01-18 22:27:14	@PikFan	but eh, who cares what people think
2014-01-18 22:27:17	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-18 22:27:21	Pikpikmate	The Wii sold more than the Xbox 360 and PS3 combined
2014-01-18 22:27:42	@PikFan	huh
2014-01-18 22:27:46	Pikpikmate	Since it was new and innovative
2014-01-18 22:27:59	Pikpikmate	They marketed it perfectly and tons of people bought it
2014-01-18 22:28:11	Pikpikmate	The Wii U I barely know much about it
2014-01-18 22:28:20	@PikFan	the Wii U's ads, like you said, were a slump
2014-01-18 22:28:39	Pikpikmate	Yeah, nothing seemed new and interesting, so people just stuck to the PS4 and Xbox One
2014-01-18 22:28:39	@PikFan	when I watched the first US Wii U ad I was like "What."
2014-01-18 22:29:05	Pikpikmate	But as I said, the Wii sold more than the Xbox 360 and PS3 combined
2014-01-18 22:29:17	Pikpikmate	They can easily afford a failure console
2014-01-18 22:30:00	Pikpikmate	Plus they've dominated the handheld console market since the 90s
2014-01-18 22:30:23	Pikpikmate	They're still doing good
2014-01-18 22:30:37	@PikFan	oh it's not like the Wii U has a tablet/controller hybrid that can be used in so many ways that'd make the PS4/Xbox One look like inferior use of technology
2014-01-18 22:30:50	Pikpikmate	But they didn't market it at all that way
2014-01-18 22:30:53	@PikFan	but wait, they DO have one
2014-01-18 22:31:31	@PikFan	I think the name was just a quick thought
2014-01-18 22:31:36	Pikpikmate	They didn't do a good job marketing and advertising and that's why nobody's buying it
2014-01-18 22:31:43	Pikpikmate	No, no
2014-01-18 22:31:49	Pikpikmate	It's definitely not the name
2014-01-18 22:32:01	Pikpikmate	Xbox One is the most retarded, garbage name ever created for any console ever
2014-01-18 22:32:11	Pikpikmate	But people still bought it

2014-01-18 22:33:17	Pikpikmate	Honestly, that's a horrible name
2014-01-18 22:33:27	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-18 22:33:37	@PikFan	why would they call it "One"
2014-01-18 22:33:41	@PikFan	makes no sense
2014-01-18 22:34:18	Pikpikmate	PS4's name isn't interesting, but at least it's consistent
2014-01-18 22:35:16	@PikFan	I've always wondered why Nintendo's hardware is less than that of Microsoft/Sony
2014-01-18 22:35:38	Pikpikmate	Both the Wii and Wii U were released before the other consoles
2014-01-18 22:35:45	Pikpikmate	That's just my guess
2014-01-18 22:35:51	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-18 22:35:55	@PikFan	oh wait
2014-01-18 22:35:59	@PikFan	I just realized why
2014-01-18 22:36:35	@PikFan	it's because both Microsoft and Sony are big hardware companies that have experience making technology
2014-01-18 22:36:54	Pikpikmate	I don't think it's that
2014-01-18 22:37:10	@PikFan	it could be
2014-01-18 22:37:30	Pikpikmate	If Nintendo had a problem making high performance hardware then they'd just pair up with some other computer maker
2014-01-18 22:38:07	Pikpikmate	Any manufacturer would love to be with Nintendo
2014-01-18 22:38:14	@PikFan	people are complaining about Nintendo's "inferior" technology compared to Microsoft/Sony
2014-01-18 22:38:28	@PikFan	they're even ranting about /graphics/
2014-01-18 22:38:35	@PikFan	...why are they so demanding
2014-01-18 22:38:40	Pikpikmate	I personally think it's because the systems are released earlier
2014-01-18 22:39:05	Pikpikmate	Like the Genesis/SNES thing
2014-01-18 22:39:10	@PikFan	the Wii U didn't have many strong titles at launch
2014-01-18 22:39:24	@PikFan	if they released it at last year
2014-01-18 22:39:37	Pikpikmate	The Sega Genesis was released while the NES was still out, and when the SNES came out it completely destroyed the Genesis hardware-wise
2014-01-18 22:39:38	@PikFan	there would be more games
2014-01-18 22:39:52	@PikFan	and people could actually choose
2014-01-18 22:40:16	@PikFan	because there wouldn't be as much negative bias against the Wii U as there is now
2014-01-18 22:40:43	Pikpikmate	It also might be because the Wii was so family oriented a lot of "hardcore gamers" didn't want something similar
2014-01-18 22:41:07	@PikFan	true
2014-01-18 22:41:17	@PikFan	Nintendo has always been family-oriented
2014-01-18 22:41:28	@PikFan	works just fine for them
2014-01-18 22:41:33	Pikpikmate	But anymore a lot of gamers aren't into that
2014-01-18 22:42:02	Pikpikmate	Personally shooters and stuff are decent, but I'm into most genres
2014-01-18 22:42:44	@PikFan	...I don't see why so many 8-year olds are into violent game
2014-01-18 22:42:46	@PikFan	*games
2014-01-18 22:42:59	Pikpikmate	It's because people can't raise their children right anymore
2014-01-18 22:43:18	@PikFan	in the 1990s, all kids had to play Nintendo
2014-01-18 22:43:25	@PikFan	well... most
2014-01-18 22:43:43	@PikFan	there wasn't much choice back then
2014-01-18 22:43:51	Pikpikmate	Genesis and Nintendo were more PG
2014-01-18 22:44:07	Pikpikmate	But when graphics got better now everything's violence related for some reason
2014-01-18 22:44:36	@PikFan	ugh
2014-01-18 22:44:45	@PikFan	I hate people who don't raise their kids right
2014-01-18 22:44:56	Pikpikmate	It's a recent thing now
2014-01-18 22:45:01	@PikFan	they should never had children
2014-01-18 22:45:04	Pikpikmate	Single parents and stuff
2014-01-18 22:45:16	Pikpikmate	Years ago this kind of thing never happened
2014-01-18 22:45:53	Pikpikmate	But now everything's like, devolving into this
2014-01-18 22:46:34	@PikFan	I'm not allowed to play violent games
2014-01-18 22:46:40	@PikFan	and honestly I don't care
2014-01-18 22:46:49	Pikpikmate	I was never allowed until I was like, 12
2014-01-18 22:47:12	@PikFan	I'm not fond of bloody, gory mutilation
2014-01-18 22:47:16	Pikpikmate	I grew up with FFVII, Pikmin, Jak and Daxter, Sonic games on Genesis
2014-01-18 22:47:35	Pikpikmate	Grand Theft Auto was more when I was 12
2014-01-18 22:47:39	@PikFan	and people hate me for that
2014-01-18 22:47:58	Pikpikmate	I'm not picky over game genres
2014-01-18 22:48:15	@PikFan	...which is just unbelievably stupid
2014-01-18 22:48:25	Pikpikmate	My top favorite games tend to be RPGs
2014-01-18 22:48:37	Pikpikmate	And yeah, that sounds pretty dumb
2014-01-18 22:48:39	@PikFan	I enjoy a good RPG
2014-01-18 22:49:02	Pikpikmate	I just got FFVII for Steam and all I did was play it all day for like 3 days and beat it
2014-01-18 22:49:21	Pikpikmate	It's my favorite game of all time
2014-01-18 22:49:51	Pikpikmate	No unnecessary bad language or excessive violence, but a great game with a great story
2014-01-18 22:50:13	@PikFan	well, I'm going outside now

2014-01-19 17:55:32	Espyo	hey
2014-01-19 17:56:24	Pikpikmate	Did anybody figure anything out with that Nintendo logo sound?
2014-01-19 17:56:40	Espyo	not yet
2014-01-19 17:57:03	Espyo	for PAL, I'm at 120 normal boots
2014-01-19 17:57:06	Espyo	out of 120 tries
2014-01-19 17:57:18	Pikpikmate	This is really ridiculous
2014-01-19 17:57:37	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-19 17:57:41	Pikpikmate	It's such a small chance for it to happen, it's frustrating
2014-01-19 17:57:46	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-19 17:58:02	Espyo	which makes it even harder to use the likes of Cheat Engine to try to understand what the possible sounds are
2014-01-19 17:58:08	Espyo	there might even be another one nobody's heard yet
2014-01-19 17:58:21	Pikpikmate	Which further confuses me, I mean, why would it even be in the game?
2014-01-19 17:58:28	Espyo	it's just an easter egg
2014-01-19 17:58:49	Pikpikmate	There's no way it's an easter egg if the chances are like 1/500
2014-01-19 17:59:47	Pikpikmate	It just doesn't make much sense to me
2014-01-19 17:59:51	Espyo	that's what an easter egg is
2014-01-19 17:59:57	Espyo	it's something very deeply hidden
2014-01-19 18:00:03	Espyo	it's for entertainment only
2014-01-19 18:45:03	Pikpikmate	I'm so pro, I don't have a flat screen TV in my room of any sort and I still have a VCR hooked up
2014-01-19 18:45:53	Espyo	hah
2014-01-19 18:48:35	Pikpikmate	VHS tapes are still way better than DVDs and stuff
2014-01-19 18:48:57	Espyo	well, they get ruined easily
2014-01-19 18:48:58	Espyo	and are bulkier
2014-01-19 18:50:10	Pikpikmate	VHS tapes are way more durable
2014-01-19 18:50:18	Pikpikmate	DVDs you scratch them they don't work
2014-01-19 18:50:48	Espyo	but VHS rots with time
2014-01-19 18:50:53	Espyo	from what I heard, anyway
2014-01-19 20:42:18	@J	hmm, I thought alternative sounds in PAL were fairly common
2014-01-19 20:43:47	Espyo	yeah, but I suppose not
2014-01-19 20:54:42	@J	maybe you're just being really unlucky
2014-01-19 20:54:53	@J	or you mixed your ISOs up
2014-01-19 20:57:04	Espyo	nope, I see the blue flag with the stars
2014-01-19 20:57:06	Espyo	in a circle
2014-01-19 21:02:32	@J	Dolphin lies?

2014-01-19 22:17:19	@J	script to generate a map of your installed packages
2014-01-19 22:17:28	@J	the size corresponds to disk space usage
2014-01-19 22:18:47	@J	slightly related, is there a way in Firefox to scroll sideways without using the scrollbar?
2014-01-19 22:19:04	@J	it's often shift+mousewheel
2014-01-19 22:19:41	Espyo	heh, nice
2014-01-19 22:19:47	Espyo	yeah, it's often that, but nope
2014-01-19 22:19:54	Espyo	no way on Firefox afaik
2014-01-19 22:20:35	Espyo	Fez is not connected to anything?
2014-01-19 22:28:44	@J	it is
2014-01-19 22:28:49	@J	it's just far from them
2014-01-19 22:30:04	@J	oh, I'm sure you realised, but connections are dependencies
2014-01-19 22:30:21	@J	not that you can really see any of them in that mess
2014-01-19 22:31:23	Espyo	right, I figured
2014-01-19 22:31:33	Espyo	it's really neat
2014-01-19 22:46:25	Pikpikmate	I'm back from sleigh riding
2014-01-19 22:47:09	Pikpikmate	Any news with the logo?

2014-01-20 02:17:27	ThePikminMeister	Just want to let you know that Tacopill posted something about a NIWA member

2014-01-20 02:23:04	ThePikminMeister	My next goal is flower rank

2014-01-20 02:23:22	ThePikminMeister	We need more users
2014-01-20 02:23:29	ThePikminMeister	More specifically, red bulborbs
2014-01-20 02:23:38	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-20 02:23:46	ThePikminMeister	New Pikminjp has a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes
2014-01-20 02:23:59	@PikFan	Pikmin Fanon is, without argument, the lowest-quality member of NIWA
2014-01-20 02:24:12	ThePikminMeister	I know
2014-01-20 02:24:25	ThePikminMeister	If only I was able to be more than one Bulborb
2014-01-20 02:24:32	ThePikminMeister	Then I would be snow and red
2014-01-20 02:25:04	ThePikminMeister	I dislike the mistakes
2014-01-20 02:25:14	ThePikminMeister	But since I'm not a red Bulborb, I can't find them :/
2014-01-20 02:25:18	ThePikminMeister	It irritates me
2014-01-20 02:25:42	@PikFan	...you don't have to be a Red Bulborb necessarily if you want to fix them
2014-01-20 02:25:49	ThePikminMeister	Oh

2014-01-21 15:15:34	@PikFan	.
2014-01-21 15:15:37	@PikFan	okay so
2014-01-21 15:15:40	Espyo	hey
2014-01-21 15:15:43	@PikFan	in Cookie Clicker
2014-01-21 15:15:53	@PikFan	...I put in a couple of cheats:
2014-01-21 15:16:05	@PikFan	1) auto click golden cookies
2014-01-21 15:16:17	@PikFan	2) auto click only during clicking frenzy
2014-01-21 15:16:48	Espyo	hm
2014-01-21 15:16:57	Espyo	I still haven't cheated
2014-01-21 15:17:01	Espyo	not even for the shadow achievements
2014-01-21 15:17:25	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-21 15:17:43	@PikFan	they didn't give me the Cheated cookies taste awful achievement
2014-01-21 15:17:50	@PikFan	anyway
2014-01-21 15:18:07	@PikFan	so I did this, along with leaving my computer on overnight
2014-01-21 15:18:17	@PikFan	got 240 quad from the wrinklers
2014-01-21 15:19:13	@PikFan	so I used most of the cookies in my bank to get 500 billion cps
2014-01-21 15:19:28	@PikFan	I still have 75 quad left
2014-01-21 15:19:42	Espyo	I would think you'd get a lot more
2014-01-21 15:19:55	@PikFan	maybe
2014-01-21 15:20:12	@PikFan	well, I only left it going for... 6 hours?
2014-01-21 15:20:52	@PikFan	I am such a night owl, even with demanding wake up times
2014-01-21 15:21:29	@PikFan	anyway
2014-01-21 15:21:42	@PikFan	I won't do those cheats again next game
2014-01-21 15:21:53	@PikFan	I just wanted to see how it would boost me
2014-01-21 15:22:38	@PikFan	...geez
2014-01-21 15:22:51	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-21 15:22:55	@PikFan	now ACs cost 99,647,613,840,477,000 cookies
2014-01-21 15:22:55	Espyo	hm, right
2014-01-21 15:23:29	Espyo	Antimatter condenser 533,139,656,460,215,040
2014-01-21 15:23:38	@PikFan	wow
2014-01-21 15:23:46	Espyo	I can buy roughly two per day
2014-01-21 15:23:52	Espyo	though I'm keeping it low on the spending
2014-01-21 15:24:04	@PikFan	right, because of the Lucky! golden cookies
2014-01-21 15:24:05	Espyo	if another update comes, I want to have cookies to buy the new upgrades
2014-01-21 15:24:15	Espyo	which is what happened with the Christmas update
2014-01-21 15:24:23	Espyo	I had enough cookies to buy everything straight off the bat
2014-01-21 15:24:31	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-21 15:24:58	@PikFan	I have to have at least 40 quad in my bank so that I get 4 quad with my Lucky! GCs
2014-01-21 15:25:26	@PikFan	that is, when my cps is Frenzy!
2014-01-21 15:26:46	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-21 15:27:32	@PikFan	also, Pikmin 3 news
2014-01-21 15:27:52	@PikFan	so I think I've found a way to do the Tropical Wilds (2nd visit) in 2 days
2014-01-21 15:28:22	Espyo	hm
2014-01-21 15:28:32	@PikFan	this, combined with my 2 days at the GoH (2nd) and 1 day (1st), will allow for a 15 day run
2014-01-21 15:31:28	Espyo	you're getting there
2014-01-21 15:31:37	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-21 15:32:17	@PikFan	I still need to finish my 11 day sprayless/Purpleless run of Pikmin 2
2014-01-21 15:33:03	Espyo	heh
2014-01-21 15:33:06	Espyo	one of the worst
2014-01-21 15:33:43	@PikFan	what do you mean, "one of the worst"?
2014-01-21 15:35:26	Espyo	one of the hardest challenges out there
2014-01-21 15:35:31	Espyo	is it also deathless?
2014-01-21 15:35:34	@PikFan	yep
2014-01-21 15:36:22	@PikFan	also I saw a video of a person trying to get the Blue Onion early
2014-01-21 15:36:33	@PikFan	but there's an invisible wall around it
2014-01-21 15:36:49	@PikFan	so any hopes for early Blues in P3 are shattered
2014-01-21 15:37:25	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-21 15:37:26	@PikFan	unless...
2014-01-21 15:37:29	Espyo	we already knew that
2014-01-21 15:37:33	@PikFan	if somehow
2014-01-21 15:37:40	@PikFan	they got OoB
2014-01-21 15:37:40	Espyo	Miles keeps saying they learned from Pikmin 2's Blue early
2014-01-21 15:37:56	@PikFan	and teleported /inside/ the Blue Onion
2014-01-21 15:38:00	@PikFan	well
2014-01-21 15:38:03	@PikFan	the wall, anyway
2014-01-21 15:38:18	@PikFan	they learned a /lot/ from P2
2014-01-21 15:38:25	@PikFan	like the double sprays glitch
2014-01-21 15:38:30	@PikFan	can't do that
2014-01-21 15:38:55	@PikFan	you've got to be careful of what you put on the internet
2014-01-21 15:39:09	@PikFan	Nintendo will be reading it and use it against you later
2014-01-21 15:40:05	@PikFan	if they made a Pikmin 4, they'll probably take what we learned from P3 and use it against us
2014-01-21 15:40:27	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-21 15:40:42	@PikFan	I hope they make a Pikmin 4
2014-01-21 15:41:33	@PikFan	Pikmin 3 has only been out for 6 months
2014-01-21 15:42:17	Espyo	they might be thinking about it
2014-01-21 15:42:22	Espyo	though there's not much else to grab it from
2014-01-21 15:42:27	Espyo	grab the series, I mean
2014-01-21 15:42:32	@PikFan	yeah...
2014-01-21 15:42:46	@PikFan	what about exploring like
2014-01-21 15:42:51	@PikFan	/other/ planets
2014-01-21 15:43:04	@PikFan	planets other than PNF-404
2014-01-21 15:43:49	@PikFan	also, I gotta go get ready for school

2014-01-21 19:09:56	Espyo	earth to J
2014-01-21 19:09:59	Espyo	need help with something basic
2014-01-21 19:47:30	@J	.
2014-01-21 19:48:24	Espyo	well, I managed a system now
2014-01-21 19:48:28	Espyo	but I'm still curious
2014-01-21 19:48:38	Espyo	suppose you have a vector with cards
2014-01-21 19:48:59	Espyo	 4 clubs, 5 hearts, Q diamonds, K diamonds, 3 clubs
2014-01-21 19:49:25	Espyo	you want to delete the cards on positions 2 and 1 from the list
2014-01-21 19:49:35	Espyo	 4 clubs, 5 hearts, K diamonds, 3 clubs
2014-01-21 19:49:38	Espyo	that's 2 deleted
2014-01-21 19:49:42	Espyo	now if we delete 1...
2014-01-21 19:49:47	Espyo	 4 clubs, K diamonds, 3 clubs
2014-01-21 19:50:00	Espyo	wait
2014-01-21 19:50:06	Espyo	the other way around
2014-01-21 19:50:08	Espyo	first 1 and 2
2014-01-21 19:50:12	@J	just reverse the indices
2014-01-21 19:50:14	Espyo	but yeah, that's pretty much the solution
2014-01-21 19:50:16	Espyo	reverse it, yeah
2014-01-21 19:50:23	@J	or determine the indices one by one after deleting each
2014-01-21 19:50:25	Espyo	though they weren't even ordered in my case
2014-01-21 19:50:38	@J	well, sort reversed
2014-01-21 19:50:43	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-21 19:50:47	Espyo	it's what I ended up doing
2014-01-21 19:50:51	Espyo	but see, I couldn't figure out a way to determine the new index of each
2014-01-21 19:50:55	Espyo	brain block, I think
2014-01-21 19:51:17	@J	hmm
2014-01-21 19:51:27	@J	it would be fiddly
2014-01-21 19:51:37	@J	and would probably amount to a sort in the end anway
2014-01-21 19:51:38	@J	*anyway
2014-01-21 19:51:58	Espyo	yeah...
2014-01-21 19:55:05	@J	I was checking if Python would let you just do it
2014-01-21 19:55:11	-->	ThePikminMeister (Mibbit@sig-584go79l.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #pikipedia
2014-01-21 19:55:26	@J	it won't, but it would be possible to write your own list/vector-type that lets you do:
2014-01-21 19:55:32	@J	del thingy[1,2,...]
2014-01-21 19:55:48	Espyo	neat
2014-01-21 19:56:06	@J	you can do 'del thingy[1:3]' by default, though
2014-01-21 19:56:11	@J	which would do what you wanted there
2014-01-21 19:56:55	Espyo	oh
2014-01-21 19:57:17	@J	actually, I probably shouldn't have written '...', because that's actually a thing
2014-01-21 19:57:29	@J	you can only use it in slice syntax (like that), and it generally means 'everything'
2014-01-21 19:57:37	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-21 19:57:46	@J	so if you had a multi-dimensional array, it would be everything in every dimension
2014-01-21 19:57:56	Espyo	right
2014-01-21 19:57:57	@J	whereas : is everything in one dimension
2014-01-21 19:58:05	Espyo	C++ has ... as well
2014-01-21 19:58:15	Espyo	you use it when you send an indefinite number of parameters to a function
2014-01-21 19:58:31	@J	you mean in the declaration?
2014-01-21 19:58:41	@J	(C++ doesn't have named parameters, does it?)
2014-01-21 19:59:18	Espyo	yep
2014-01-21 19:59:20	Espyo	(it doesn't)
2014-01-21 19:59:24	@J	hmm
2014-01-21 19:59:46	@J	in Python it's 'def f (arg, *other_args, **name_args): ...'
2014-01-21 20:00:07	@J	which is nice, because you can match it up to calls: 'f(1, *list_of_things)'
2014-01-21 20:00:28	@J	that is, calls and definitions use the same syntax, making it obvious that they correspond to each other
2014-01-21 20:01:00	Espyo	hm, right
2014-01-21 20:03:02	@J	oh, and it doesn't have to match up
2014-01-21 20:03:29	@J	'def f (a, b, c): ...' 'args = [1, 2, 3]; f(*args)'

2014-01-21 20:04:15	@J	and I scared off that guy
2014-01-21 20:04:19	Espyo	hah yeah
2014-01-21 20:04:24	@J	I regret nothing
2014-01-21 20:04:29	Espyo	that's pretty grand though
2014-01-21 20:05:08	@J	okay, so printscreen is set to just dump a screenshot in my home directory, without any confirmation
2014-01-21 20:05:21	@J	so every now and then I find random screenshots in there from accidental presses
2014-01-21 20:05:34	Espyo	kinda the same thing with Fraps, really
2014-01-21 20:06:12	@J	doesn't that show some icon/FPS display or something, though?
2014-01-21 20:07:29	Espyo	it does
2014-01-21 20:07:38	Espyo	and it does blink when a screenshot is taken
2014-01-21 20:07:50	Espyo	but accidental button presses are still accidental
2014-01-21 20:08:16	Espyo	in fact, I should make it save them on the desktop
2014-01-21 20:08:32	Espyo	so that I can delete those I know are accidents soon after, and save the other ones in the right place
2014-01-21 20:08:38	Espyo	before I forget if something's a mistake or not

2014-01-21 20:50:24	Espyo	so I was thinking
2014-01-21 20:50:41	Espyo	you know how some glitches we have on the glitch pages don't have any proof, and nobody's reproduced them yet?
2014-01-21 20:50:53	Espyo	I suggest we have a new parameter, "confirmed"
2014-01-21 20:51:12	Espyo	all those that have been confirmed by other members can have a "Yes"
2014-01-21 20:51:22	Espyo	all those that were added but never reproduced can have a "No"
2014-01-21 20:51:41	Espyo	yay/nay?
2014-01-21 20:52:52	Prezintenden	ehhhhh
2014-01-21 20:53:42	Prezintenden	sounds really weird. "hey guys, we have this list of glitches, but we don't trust our users enough to think they really happened lol"
2014-01-21 20:54:32	Prezintenden	I don't think it's a bad, bad idea but... mmm
2014-01-21 20:55:04	Espyo	it's mostly for recent reports
2014-01-21 20:55:09	Espyo	some user found a glitch in Pikmin 3
2014-01-21 20:55:10	Espyo	they add it
2014-01-21 20:55:22	Espyo	but we leave a small disclaimer that this hasn't really been confirmed by anybody else
2014-01-21 20:55:49	Espyo	just because several people tried and couldn't reproduce doesn't mean the glitch is fake
2014-01-21 20:56:06	Espyo	or maybe something of the sort
2014-01-21 20:56:12	Espyo	some sort of rating system...?
2014-01-21 20:56:18	Espyo	*
2014-01-21 20:56:21	Espyo	and then you mouse over that ^
2014-01-21 20:56:36	Espyo	and then it tells you: 4 users have been able to reproduce this glitch. 3 users have not.
2014-01-21 20:56:39	Prezintenden	rating system wat
2014-01-21 20:56:48	Espyo	or maybe I'm just going WAY crazy now
2014-01-21 20:56:53	Prezintenden	yeah
2014-01-21 20:56:53	Espyo	but still, we should have /something/
2014-01-21 20:57:12	Prezintenden	then I'd prefer a note that the glitch has only been done by the contributor
2014-01-21 20:58:06	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-21 20:58:11	Espyo	which is basically what I had in mind
2014-01-21 20:58:13	Espyo	but more simplistic

2014-01-21 21:13:09	Prezintenden	yeah...
2014-01-21 21:13:14	Espyo	a no would mean it can't be reproduced at all
2014-01-21 21:13:22	Espyo	...don't we have a reproducibility field anyway?
2014-01-21 21:13:36	Prezintenden	a difficulty of reproducability
2014-01-21 21:13:47	Prezintenden	not sure what it's called in the template
2014-01-21 21:13:59	Espyo	just Reproducibility
2014-01-21 21:14:02	Espyo	Low, Medium or High
2014-01-21 21:14:03	@J	well then that's enough, isn't it?
2014-01-21 21:14:39	@J	reproducibility low means it probably just kind of happened that time but who knows why
2014-01-21 21:14:46	Prezintenden	actually yeah, add an array that's "unverified" or something
2014-01-21 21:14:54	Espyo	well, it isn't so much a question of it being reproduced as it is a question of it being confirmed by more than one people as a real glitch
2014-01-21 21:15:39	Prezintenden	(i really hope is used array right) I think green accidentally got onto something
2014-01-21 21:16:03	Prezintenden	if no one else has tried the glitch we don't know how often it happens anyway
2014-01-21 21:16:08	Prezintenden	so I'd just put it there
2014-01-21 21:16:52	@J	or just put 'unknown' in reproducibility
2014-01-21 21:17:38	Prezintenden	but espyo wants to explicitly tell people that nobody else has verified the glitch exists
2014-01-21 21:18:01	@J	yeah, I know
2014-01-21 21:18:26	Prezintenden	oh you
2014-01-21 21:18:27	@J	but then, unverified means one person says they did it; verified means 2 people said they did it
2014-01-21 21:18:36	@J	not really very different
2014-01-21 21:19:38	Prezintenden	I though this was about "is someone just making this up/didn't quite understand what is going on", in which case another person getting exactly what was described would verify it
2014-01-21 21:19:44	Prezintenden	*thought
2014-01-21 21:21:46	@J	yes, but I'm just saying it's quite subjective
2014-01-21 21:21:54	@J	at what point do you consider it verified?
2014-01-21 21:21:58	@J	just one other person?
2014-01-21 21:22:05	@J	some random guy, or a regular user?
2014-01-21 21:22:13	Prezintenden	someone we trust i guess
2014-01-21 21:22:18	Prezintenden	"trust"
2014-01-21 21:22:22	Prezintenden	hurr hurr
2014-01-21 21:22:23	@J	yeah
2014-01-21 21:23:43	Prezintenden	ugh
2014-01-21 21:23:53	Prezintenden	i guess 'unknown' is the best option
2014-01-21 21:27:32	Espyo	we have a couple of "unknown"s here and there
2014-01-21 21:27:46	Espyo	but they're really not indicative of the fact that nobody double-checked if the glitch is real
2014-01-21 21:28:10	Espyo	there is no objective point to consider something verified, I'd say
2014-01-21 21:29:11	Espyo	or else, PikminLover77462 submits a glitch about a Yellow Pikmin turning orange after he told his Pikmin to deliver Olimar to the Onion 500 times in a day
2014-01-21 21:29:29	Espyo	and then I_like-purplesXD444 double-checks the glitch
2014-01-21 21:29:33	Espyo	and oh, they're both brothers
2014-01-21 21:29:37	Espyo	and they're both just pulling our legs
2014-01-21 21:29:52	Espyo	but the users can at least see that something with 5 confirmations is more credible than 1 or 2
2014-01-21 21:30:14	Espyo	not to mention that it's kinda objective that some of our editors are trustworthy people
2014-01-21 21:30:26	Espyo	maybe not necessarily 100%, but people whose word kinda makes all further discussion moot
2014-01-21 21:30:45	Espyo	pair that with video or image evidence, and that would be enough for people to reach their own conclusions
2014-01-21 21:32:16	Prezintenden	What stops someone from making 5 accounts and confirming his fake glitch 5 times
2014-01-21 21:32:36	Espyo	heh, nothing
2014-01-21 21:32:44	Espyo	though it'd be easy to pick up on
2014-01-21 21:32:54	Espyo	plus, the whole video evidence thing
2014-01-21 21:33:05	Espyo	also I'm considering having a list of the users who checked it as confirmed somewhere
2014-01-21 21:33:57	Prezintenden	Big Brother Espyo
2014-01-21 21:35:22	Espyo	heh
2014-01-21 21:35:27	Espyo	I shan't rest until I control all though
2014-01-21 21:35:44	@J	hmm, I don't really see many people going through and verifying all the glitches they can
2014-01-21 21:35:56	@J	so most of them will have low numbers
2014-01-21 21:35:57	Espyo	true
2014-01-21 21:36:00	@J	but it could work, I guess
2014-01-21 21:36:23	Espyo	but we should have at least something to differentiate those glitches that are real and those that were recently added by some confused newbie
2014-01-21 21:36:33	@J	mm
2014-01-21 21:36:39	Espyo	although...
2014-01-21 21:36:46	Espyo	otoh, we DO try to have evidence at all times
2014-01-21 21:36:52	Espyo	and really, that's more than enough to prove a glitch is real
2014-01-21 21:37:03	Espyo	err... except for when Action Replay is secretly used
2014-01-21 21:37:12	Prezintenden	I still think the easiest way would be to keep it "unverified" until "one of us" tries it
2014-01-21 21:38:19	Espyo	right

2014-01-21 22:29:47	Miles	Even if a glitch is real with video proof etc., I don't think it's worth including if it's something that just happened to one person
2014-01-21 22:30:35	Miles	Like, I wouldn't include "bitter spray puddle looks like a spicy spray puddle"
2014-01-21 22:31:53	Espyo	can't say I disagree
2014-01-21 22:32:05	Espyo	but it's better to have too much rather than too less
2014-01-21 22:32:17	Espyo	that one only really happened once, but it still raises interest
2014-01-21 22:32:29	Espyo	certainly makes a person go "buh-what?!"

2014-01-24 22:28:27	Espyo	to test whether my hitboxes were working, I made it so any contact between a Pikmin and an enemy hitbox made some text output on the console
2014-01-24 22:28:30	Espyo	everything worked fine
2014-01-24 22:28:38	Espyo	until I brought a bunch of Pikmin to touch the enemy
2014-01-24 22:28:52	Espyo	then the framerate dropped from 30 to 10

2014-01-24 22:29:11	Espyo	the game can even run at 60 FPS fine
2014-01-24 22:29:32	Espyo	never expected cout to be so incredibly CPU intensive

2014-01-25 00:15:05	@J	well, it has to communicate with the process doing the actual printing for every line
2014-01-25 00:15:47	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-25 00:15:48	Espyo	but still...
2014-01-25 00:15:49	@J	and probably cmd on Windows is slow anyway
2014-01-25 00:15:57	Espyo	to the point of bringing a ~120FPS game to 10FPS...
2014-01-25 00:16:05	Espyo	the command line on windows is definitely slow, yep
2014-01-25 00:16:11	Espyo	actually...
2014-01-25 00:16:27	Espyo	I have a batch script to take stuff out of a folder to the parent folder, and remove it
2014-01-25 00:16:44	Espyo	I can call a folder to use that script using the send to menu
2014-01-25 00:17:02	Espyo	but for folders with a lot of files, if I cut-paste them all myself, it's faster than with the command line
2014-01-25 00:17:16	Espyo	and it must be because it prints out the move for all files
2014-01-25 00:20:10	@J	hmm
2014-01-25 00:20:15	@J	yeah, probably
2014-01-25 00:20:44	@J	so, today I had another huge hard drive failure
2014-01-25 00:20:52	@J	I couldn't boot and stuff
2014-01-25 00:21:13	@J	X (the thing that does the display) was broken, and I think parts of the kernel too
2014-01-25 00:21:13	Espyo	that has to be a physical problem
2014-01-25 00:21:21	@J	yeah, I know, I need a new hard drive
2014-01-25 00:21:24	@J	but lazy
2014-01-25 00:21:44	Espyo	uh...
2014-01-25 00:21:50	Espyo	a bit of my ceiling just fell down
2014-01-25 00:21:58	@J	...
2014-01-25 00:22:08	@J	what are you doing that your house is angry at you?
2014-01-25 00:22:20	Espyo	well, the painting of a moldy corner
2014-01-25 00:22:24	Espyo	not an actual chunk
2014-01-25 00:22:30	@J	...right
2014-01-25 00:22:35	Espyo	let's see, we have a hypersensitive neighbor
2014-01-25 00:22:43	Espyo	nobody can make a sound, or else he goes mad and slams doors and such
2014-01-25 00:22:54	Espyo	so I suppose the sound of me breathing must've ticked him off to the point of kicking down
2014-01-25 00:22:57	Espyo	and making some ceiling fall
2014-01-25 00:23:00	@J	I see
2014-01-25 00:23:12	Espyo	either that or mold is moldy
2014-01-25 00:23:19	Espyo	uh... the word isn't "mold", is it
2014-01-25 00:23:25	Espyo	Firefox is complaining that that's not it
2014-01-25 00:24:13	@J	what spellcheck language are you using?
2014-01-25 00:24:32	Espyo	UK
2014-01-25 00:24:39	Espyo	mould
2014-01-25 00:24:39	@J	UK spelling is mould
2014-01-25 00:24:43	Espyo	egh
2014-01-25 00:25:02	Espyo	hey, what about that thing that makes cakes take their shape?
2014-01-25 00:25:11	@J	same spelling
2014-01-25 00:25:14	Espyo	oh
2014-01-25 00:25:40	@J	not sure if US is the same in both cases, though
2014-01-25 00:25:45	Espyo	I think so
2014-01-25 00:25:46	@J	one of them is mold
2014-01-25 00:25:59	Espyo	what about the verb to shapen?
2014-01-25 00:26:01	@J	so anyway, everything was broken
2014-01-25 00:26:04	Espyo	also mould, I'd assume
2014-01-25 00:26:13	Espyo	...I guess "shapen" is also not a word
2014-01-25 00:26:16	Espyo	what even IS a word right now
2014-01-25 00:26:23	@J	well, it's related to the cake thing, so yeah
2014-01-25 00:26:25	Espyo	Testyo: make a word
2014-01-25 00:26:30	Espyo	oh right, serious
2014-01-25 00:26:31	Espyo	Testyo: unserious
2014-01-25 00:26:31	Testyo	I wasn't in serious mode...
2014-01-25 00:26:35	@J	...
2014-01-25 00:26:37	Espyo	Testyo: unserious #pikipedia
2014-01-25 00:26:37	Testyo	I am no longer in serious mode on #pikipedia; I can do funny random things again!
2014-01-25 00:26:39	Espyo	Testyo: make a word
2014-01-25 00:26:39	Testyo	Luhupo.
2014-01-25 00:27:02	@J	but package managers are great
2014-01-25 00:27:05	Espyo	...I just realized using Testyo to make species names for Pikmin fangames is the best thing ever
2014-01-25 00:27:05	Testyo	I'm not saying you're not on youtube I don't
2014-01-25 00:27:12	@J	so I can just run a command to verify every file of every installed program
2014-01-25 00:27:14	Espyo	'cause you can just redownload them?
2014-01-25 00:27:17	Espyo	oh yeah
2014-01-25 00:27:20	Espyo	I remember doing that in classes
2014-01-25 00:27:22	@J	filter by package and reinstall all the corrupted ones
2014-01-25 00:27:40	@J	and suddenly everything's as it was before
2014-01-25 00:27:45	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-25 00:27:49	Espyo	pretty magic
2014-01-25 00:27:55	Espyo	but that's still no excuse not to get a new hard drive
2014-01-25 00:28:00	@J	no
2014-01-25 00:28:09	Espyo	no, it's not
2014-01-25 00:28:11	@J	but as I've said before, I want to get a new computer
2014-01-25 00:28:15	Espyo	oh
2014-01-25 00:28:23	@J	and that takes effort
2014-01-25 00:28:44	@J	but if I do that, I'm not sure getting a new hard drive is important
2014-01-25 00:29:06	Espyo	well, if you get a new computer, you get a new everything
2014-01-25 00:31:26	@J	yeah
2014-01-25 00:31:38	@J	but I mean, I wouldn't get one for this laptop as well
2014-01-25 00:31:54	Espyo	only if you really plan on using this one still
2014-01-25 00:33:42	@J	well, I don't think I'd bother if I used it infrequently
2014-01-25 00:34:37	Espyo	exactly

2014-01-25 13:55:29	@J	they're fine, just minor spacing changes
2014-01-25 13:58:50	Espyo	yeah, are they /really/ needed?
2014-01-25 14:06:04	@J	is there anything wrong with them?
2014-01-25 14:06:47	Espyo	no, but are they needed?
2014-01-25 14:06:58	Espyo	like, will it generate extra newlines in pages if it's not like that?
2014-01-25 14:07:02	Espyo	(also, lunch)
2014-01-25 14:16:11	@J	yeah, it makes the spacing work better

2014-01-25 17:59:15	@PikFan	thanks
2014-01-25 17:59:35	@PikFan	don't you turn 22 this year
2014-01-25 18:01:04	Pikpikmate	Oh, happy birthday
2014-01-25 18:01:17	@PikFan	thanks
2014-01-25 18:01:24	@PikFan	so
2014-01-25 18:01:26	Pikpikmate	I'm almost 16 and a half
2014-01-25 18:01:27	Espyo	I'm 22 now
2014-01-25 18:01:37	Espyo	 23 this year, several months from now
2014-01-25 18:01:50	@PikFan	I REALLY need to start adding Pikmin 3 stuff
2014-01-25 18:01:55	@PikFan	ah
2014-01-25 18:02:21	Pikpikmate	A friend of mine should be gettin Pikmin 3 soon, so I could start adding stuff in a couple weeks
2014-01-25 18:03:03	@PikFan	I think I should do fruits first
2014-01-25 18:03:13	@J	Espyo: hmm, I thought I was more older than you than that
2014-01-25 18:03:18	@J	(...if that even makes sense)
2014-01-25 18:03:34	Espyo	it does
2014-01-25 18:03:47	Espyo	though at first I thought you meant you thought you were older but turns out you were not
2014-01-25 18:04:34	@PikFan	but I'll still have to add images and create the fruits navbox
2014-01-25 18:05:04	Pikpikmate	Somethin's better than nothin
2014-01-25 18:05:30	@PikFan	Espyo: on the GamePad screen, there's a fruits menu
2014-01-25 18:06:01	@PikFan	and it shows every type of fruit you've collected so far
2014-01-25 18:06:37	Espyo	ah, nice
2014-01-25 18:06:43	@PikFan	when you get Pikmin 3, maybe you could figure out how to rip it and upload it
2014-01-25 18:06:53	Espyo	heh, no way
2014-01-25 18:06:58	Espyo	well
2014-01-25 18:07:16	@PikFan	is ripping not possible on the Wii U yet?
2014-01-25 18:07:17	Espyo	the only way would be to take a screenshot of the screen using a capture card
2014-01-25 18:07:20	Espyo	nope
2014-01-25 18:07:27	Espyo	people still don't know the format
2014-01-25 18:07:36	@PikFan	I see
2014-01-25 18:07:41	Espyo	besides, Nintendo might be sneakier than ever before, now
2014-01-25 18:07:53	Espyo	not only are their file formats probably more convoluted than ever
2014-01-25 18:08:07	Espyo	but they might've also compressed them even further and used weirder formats
2014-01-25 18:08:07	@PikFan	we'll figure it out someday
2014-01-25 18:08:13	Espyo	because heck, Pikmin 2 had plain text files
2014-01-25 18:08:20	Espyo	now the config files could be in like binary
2014-01-25 18:08:24	Espyo	just to make sure we don't mess around
2014-01-25 18:08:34	@PikFan	ugh, binary?
2014-01-25 18:08:49	Espyo	but when/if I get Pikmin 3, if my capture card is still good, I'll take snapshots and crop out the fruits
2014-01-25 18:08:51	Espyo	better than nothing
2014-01-25 18:08:58	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-25 18:09:16	Espyo	instead of "{f010} 40"
2014-01-25 18:09:25	Espyo	we have stuff that's not in a human readable format
2014-01-25 18:09:44	Miles	Um, they had stuff you couldn't read in the Pikmin 1 files
2014-01-25 18:09:53	Miles	That was changed to stuff you could easily read in Pikmin 2
2014-01-25 18:09:54	@PikFan	is there a binary translator
2014-01-25 18:10:26	Miles	I wouldn't say for sure what the file format in Pikmin 3 is like
2014-01-25 18:16:12	Espyo	I know, but I mean making everything unreadable until the format is figured out
2014-01-25 18:16:20	Espyo	Pikmin 1 had some readable files
2014-01-25 18:16:23	Espyo	even plain text files
2014-01-25 18:16:30	Espyo	...also a C++ header file

2014-01-26 12:41:13	Espyo	I see that sometimes you join IRC and quit right away because nobody is there
2014-01-26 12:41:18	Espyo	you have to be a bit more patient
2014-01-26 12:41:22	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-01-26 12:41:29	Espyo	sometimes people just had to go take the trash out or something

2014-01-26 12:45:47	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-26 12:46:06	Espyo	the HUD, most of the physics
2014-01-26 12:46:14	Espyo	some sound effects
2014-01-26 12:46:21	Espyo	some Pikmin intelligence
2014-01-26 12:46:21	TehPehEhm	I don't know what the HUD is
2014-01-26 12:46:30	TehPehEhm	PIKMIN AI
2014-01-26 12:46:33	Espyo	some enemy intelligence and collisions
2014-01-26 12:46:37	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-01-26 12:46:39	Espyo	the HUD is the Heads-Up Display
2014-01-26 12:46:45	Espyo	it's a term in several games
2014-01-26 12:46:50	TehPehEhm	Ok
2014-01-26 12:46:53	Espyo	it's the numbers you see on the screen at all time
2014-01-26 12:47:05	Espyo	the number of Pikmin, number of sprays, current day, etc.
2014-01-26 12:47:09	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-01-26 12:47:35	TehPehEhm	Not many people are active on Pikmin Fanon anymore
2014-01-26 12:48:09	Espyo	yeah, it's a bit sad
2014-01-26 12:48:17	Espyo	hopefully the engine and Super Smash Bros. 4 will bring new life to it
2014-01-26 12:48:37	TehPehEhm	How will smash bros 4 do anything?
2014-01-26 12:48:40	TehPehEhm	Oh... Nvm

2014-01-26 12:54:25	TehPehEhm	I think I only have to write the bosses, make two more enemy pictures, 2 area maps, and 3 dungeons
2014-01-26 13:02:39	TehPehEhm	Someone made a comment on the engine
2014-01-26 13:04:53	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-26 13:05:02	Espyo	I'm replying, but I'm taking a long time because I'm also cleaning up the page
2014-01-26 13:05:12	TehPehEhm	Ok

2014-01-26 13:21:41	Espyo	I made it so that whenever somebody messages me or changes the engine thread, I'll get an e-mail notification

2014-01-26 13:28:12	TehPehEhm	I read the reply
2014-01-26 13:28:19	TehPehEhm	Sprite sheets?
2014-01-26 13:28:55	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-26 13:29:01	Espyo	those are images that have several sprites inside
2014-01-26 13:29:04	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-01-26 13:29:06	Espyo	and the game picks the right one for the animation
2014-01-26 13:29:11	TehPehEhm	How do you make sprites?
2014-01-26 13:29:11	Espyo	if you google "sprite sheet", you'll see
2014-01-26 13:29:19	Espyo	using Paint or something of the sort
2014-01-26 13:29:23	Espyo	I might make a tutorial one day
2014-01-26 13:29:30	TehPehEhm	Ok
2014-01-26 13:29:54	TehPehEhm	So do sprite sheets have pictures of the same enemy, but doing different actions?
2014-01-26 13:31:24	Espyo	exactly
2014-01-26 13:31:43	TehPehEhm	Hmmm
2014-01-26 13:32:12	TehPehEhm	Are they pixelated or drawn?
2014-01-26 13:33:09	Espyo	it depends on the style
2014-01-26 13:33:17	Espyo	for instance, on the sprites I have at the moment
2014-01-26 13:33:25	Espyo	I use a program that draws the circles and such automatically
2014-01-26 13:33:31	Espyo	but I could've drawn pixel-by-pixel
2014-01-26 13:33:39	TehPehEhm	Oh
2014-01-26 13:33:48	TehPehEhm	It will be hard for me to make sprites
2014-01-26 13:35:39	Espyo	it'll take time, I can't deny that...
2014-01-26 13:38:53	TehPehEhm	Say  you said you use a program to make sprites automatically?
2014-01-26 13:39:35	Espyo	not quite automatically
2014-01-26 13:39:39	TehPehEhm	Is it free?
2014-01-26 13:39:52	Espyo	you can't just tell it "draw a Cloaking Burrow-nit" and it'll do it heh
2014-01-26 13:39:57	TehPehEhm	Lol
2014-01-26 13:40:06	Espyo	instead of drawing pixel per pixel, you draw an actual circle, you shape it a bit
2014-01-26 13:40:15	Espyo	and when you know it, boom, you have a nose for the Cloaking Burrow-nit
2014-01-26 13:40:32	TehPehEhm	So is it free?
2014-01-26 13:40:38	Espyo	instead of having to draw the pixel at the tip red, the pixel behind slightly whiter, the pixel to the left and behind of the tip, etc.
2014-01-26 13:40:40	Espyo	it is free
2014-01-26 13:40:42	Espyo	it's called Inkscape
2014-01-26 13:40:48	Espyo	I have lunch, so brb

2014-01-26 17:10:14	@J	okay, so I wrote the same function in 2 different ways
2014-01-26 17:10:26	@J	one is faster for low numbers of things, one for high numbers of things
2014-01-26 17:10:38	Espyo	...that reminds me, I need a quickdist function
2014-01-26 17:10:46	@J	is it normal to map a function to 2 different implementations based on the order?
2014-01-26 17:10:52	Espyo	you can calculate distances faster than just a square root, using some C++ trickery
2014-01-26 17:11:08	Espyo	based on the order?
2014-01-26 17:11:15	Espyo	the order of things it needs to work on, you mean?
2014-01-26 17:11:15	@J	order = number of things
2014-01-26 17:11:18	@J	the 'order of the problem'
2014-01-26 17:11:20	@J	yeah
2014-01-26 17:11:21	Espyo	right
2014-01-26 17:11:25	Espyo	yeah, I think that's reasonable

2014-01-26 17:12:17	@J	3 is probably the most likely use case
2014-01-26 17:12:44	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-26 17:12:55	Espyo	yeah, really makes sense to have it be different
2014-01-26 17:13:36	@J	are you talking about the fast inverse square root, or something else?
2014-01-26 17:14:31	@J	I wonder if it you could guess that 'old' is recursive and 'new' isn't
2014-01-26 17:14:35	@J	*if you
2014-01-26 17:14:46	Espyo	I don't even know what your function does, so I couldn't even guess
2014-01-26 17:16:07	Espyo	trying to see if I can find what Doom does
2014-01-26 17:17:44	@J	I mean, just from the way the timings scale
2014-01-26 17:17:46	@J	I don't know
2014-01-26 17:17:56	@J	it pretty much doubles each time
2014-01-26 17:17:59	Espyo	hm, I suppose
2014-01-26 17:19:08	Espyo	http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Sound_effects_behave_differently_on_level_8 there's this approx_dist
2014-01-26 17:22:07	@J	looks like binomial expansion
2014-01-26 17:22:44	@J	(1 + x) ^ .5 = 1 + .5x for x << 1
2014-01-26 17:22:54	@J	uh...that's much less than, not the bitshift in the code
2014-01-26 17:23:01	Espyo	oh
2014-01-26 17:23:11	@J	and also s/=/squiggly =/
2014-01-26 17:23:42	Espyo	too lazy to grab squiggly = from the character map
2014-01-26 17:23:54	Espyo	even though I'm studying, and any little thing like that would be more than enough incentive for me to do it
2014-01-26 17:24:29	@J	it basically says one of the axes contributes more to the distance than the other, and where that's not the case they both contribute the same-ish, so it works out either way
2014-01-26 17:24:44	@J	that's probably _really_ approximate, though, so only really useful for sound and things like it
2014-01-26 17:24:56	@J	you could plot it and compare to the real function

2014-01-26 17:47:56	Espyo	works either way afaik

2014-01-26 17:48:15	Espyo	you mean
2014-01-26 17:48:27	Espyo	ugh, you mean a lookup table in which one number matches to one equation?
2014-01-26 17:48:37	Espyo	instead of one number matching another one? (e.g. sine)
2014-01-26 17:48:58	@J	yeah

2014-01-26 17:50:23	@J	yeah, but I mean
2014-01-26 17:50:34	@J	I can just write explicit equations for any number of things
2014-01-26 17:50:49	Espyo	not following
2014-01-26 17:50:50	@J	they're recursive sums
2014-01-26 17:51:01	@J	or
2014-01-26 17:51:10	@J	just think of it as a recursive function
2014-01-26 17:51:43	Espyo	uh huh?
2014-01-26 17:52:02	@J	you can write f(xs) = reduce(multiply, xs) or something
2014-01-26 17:52:11	@J	or you can write f(x1, x2) = x1 * x2

2014-01-26 17:58:27	Espyo	in general, it's probably worth it for up to... 3 or 4, really
2014-01-26 17:58:36	Espyo	I know, just confirming
2014-01-26 17:59:06	Espyo	sensible?
2014-01-26 17:59:10	@J	and 'new' does the same thing, but not recursively
2014-01-26 17:59:15	Espyo	right
2014-01-26 17:59:34	@J	sensible = not crazy
2014-01-26 18:01:03	@J	slightly related, I think I managed to eliminate the problem of conflicting interpolations
2014-01-26 18:01:19	Espyo	right, 3 would be not crazy
2014-01-26 18:01:31	@J	that is, if you set off a thing moving along a path, then set it off moving along another path, it doesn't try to move along both at once
2014-01-26 18:01:45	Espyo	you mean it doesn't interpolate both paths?
2014-01-26 18:01:46	Espyo	shame
2014-01-26 18:01:50	@J	though obviously it's not just for actual movement
2014-01-26 18:01:55	@J	well, what would that even mean?
2014-01-26 18:02:36	@J	the most common case is that you want something to move to a destination smoothly
2014-01-26 18:02:50	@J	then while it's moving, you want it to move somewhere else instead
2014-01-26 18:03:01	@J	in which case you want to stop the first 'move command' entirely
2014-01-26 18:03:45	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/interpolation.png red and blue are paths, purple is the path it actually takes
2014-01-26 18:03:57	@J	but you never actually really want that
2014-01-26 18:04:03	Espyo	oh, you want to stop the first one?
2014-01-26 18:04:22	@J	well, can you think of an example where you wouldn't?
2014-01-26 18:04:31	Espyo	good point
2014-01-26 18:04:41	@J	it's more like, now you don't have to keep track of existing interpolations and cancel them when you start a new one
2014-01-26 18:04:49	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-26 18:05:06	@J	but that's actually a good idea: an interpolation preset that averages a number of other interpolation functions
2014-01-26 18:05:15	@J	shouldn't be hard to write
2014-01-26 18:05:37	Espyo	yeah, it shouldn't
2014-01-26 18:05:42	Espyo	but again... what would it be used for?
2014-01-26 18:05:46	@J	no idea
2014-01-26 18:06:00	@J	hey, it was your idea
2014-01-26 18:06:04	Espyo	though it really looks like one of those things that /should/ exist, doesn't it?
2014-01-26 18:06:17	Espyo	should look pretty, too
2014-01-26 18:06:25	Espyo	can't help but think that there's SOME use
2014-01-26 18:07:31	@J	you could just use it for some particle patterns
2014-01-26 18:07:42	@J	like, take a circular motion and add some linear motion
2014-01-26 18:07:47	@J	suddenly you have a spiral
2014-01-26 18:08:33	Espyo	oh yeah
2014-01-26 18:08:34	@J	but that would be more of a sum than an average
2014-01-26 18:10:35	@J	and it would just work, even though it's 2D, because everything works on arbitrarily nested sequences
2014-01-26 18:11:01	@J	you could even do it in 3D, and map the 3rd output to size, or colour, or transparency
2014-01-26 18:11:45	Espyo	off course
2014-01-26 18:12:40	@J	lolpun-ish
2014-01-26 18:13:20	Espyo	what
2014-01-26 18:13:25	Espyo	brain, don't do stuff without my consent
2014-01-26 18:13:40	Espyo	maybe it was the fingers' fault
2014-01-26 18:13:50	Espyo	I /really/ don't remember writing that other f
2014-01-26 18:13:53	@J	or Testyo has started injecting puns into your messages
2014-01-26 18:13:59	Espyo	...oh no
2014-01-26 18:14:02	Espyo	he's taking over, I knew it
2014-01-26 18:14:48	Pikpikmate	Off course?
2014-01-26 18:14:55	Pikpikmate	Reminds me of FFVII
2014-01-26 18:15:11	Pikpikmate	If you get what I mean you deserve a cookie
2014-01-26 18:15:18	Espyo	really need to try a FF game...
2014-01-26 18:15:53	Pikpikmate	If you like RPGs they're probably the best of the best
2014-01-26 18:16:15	Pikpikmate	I love I-X
2014-01-26 18:16:32	Pikpikmate	Anything after X I dislike
2014-01-26 18:16:52	@J	heh
2014-01-26 18:17:03	@J	roman numerals are getting mixed up with pronouns
2014-01-26 18:17:09	Pikpikmate	It happens
2014-01-26 18:17:16	@J	every day
2014-01-26 18:17:39	@J	hmm, I've probably only played 5 or so RPGs
2014-01-26 18:17:44	@J	non-tiny ones, anyway
2014-01-26 18:17:50	Pikpikmate	I'm a big RPG fan
2014-01-26 18:18:11	Pikpikmate	I just got FFVII on Steam and played it nonstop for 3 days until I beat it
2014-01-26 18:18:28	Espyo	I only really play RPGs that go a bit off-the-wall
2014-01-26 18:18:31	Pikpikmate	I put at least a good 70 as of now
2014-01-26 18:18:32	Espyo	like Paper Mario and EarthBound
2014-01-26 18:18:36	Pikpikmate	hours*
2014-01-26 18:18:51	Pikpikmate	I've played and enjoyed both
2014-01-26 18:19:16	Pikpikmate	Paper Mario 1 or 2?
2014-01-26 18:19:57	@J	I played 1 but never finished it
2014-01-26 18:20:19	@J	although, that's not saying much considering how many games I haven't finished
2014-01-26 18:20:19	Espyo	the first
2014-01-26 18:20:24	Espyo	oh, and Super Paper Mario, although...
2014-01-26 18:20:30	@J	oh, I just remembered TWEWY
2014-01-26 18:20:34	@J	I should finish that too
2014-01-26 18:20:46	Espyo	hmm, twewy?
2014-01-26 18:20:49	Espyo	doesn't ring a bell
2014-01-26 18:21:08	@J	The World Ends With You
2014-01-26 18:21:11	Pikpikmate	I've never played Super Paper Mario
2014-01-26 18:21:12	@J	DS Square Enix game

2014-01-26 18:21:28	Pikpikmate	Now, if they put it on Gamecube like they SAID they would I probably would've gotten it
2014-01-26 18:22:28	Espyo	heh
2014-01-26 18:22:31	Espyo	oh, right
2014-01-26 18:23:01	Pikpikmate	The Gamecube had so much more potential
2014-01-26 18:23:11	Pikpikmate	It handled Twilight Princess pretty well, didn't it?
2014-01-26 18:23:49	Espyo	sure did
2014-01-26 18:24:26	Pikpikmate	I don't know many other GC games that used such good graphics efficiently like that
2014-01-26 18:24:53	Pikpikmate	I always thought Pikmin 2 looked nice, though
2014-01-26 18:25:29	Pikpikmate	Some games had such bad graphics it wasn't even funny though
2014-01-26 18:25:33	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-26 18:25:44	Pikpikmate	Has anybody heard of Ed Edd and Eddy the Mis-Edventures?
2014-01-26 18:25:44	Espyo	Super Mario Sunshine also looks pretty great
2014-01-26 18:25:52	Espyo	oh, and the Metroid Prime games, hands down
2014-01-26 18:25:54	Pikpikmate	Sunshine looked decent
2014-01-26 18:25:55	Espyo	I've /heard/ of it, yeah
2014-01-26 18:26:08	Espyo	Sunshine was nothing special, but it did nothing wrong graphically
2014-01-26 18:26:14	Espyo	so I really appreciate that
2014-01-26 18:26:20	Pikpikmate	The game was mediocre, but the graphics were absolutely horrible with the Ed Edd and Eddy game
2014-01-26 18:27:04	Espyo	I think there've been a few EEE games, none of them really good
2014-01-26 18:27:30	Pikpikmate	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-jaWuuiZOQ
2014-01-26 18:27:47	Pikpikmate	Personally I've yet to find a worse looking GC game
2014-01-26 18:28:29	Espyo	eugh
2014-01-26 18:28:51	Espyo	doesn't really look like they used most of the same staff
2014-01-26 18:29:18	Espyo	the humor doesn't sound that good
2014-01-26 18:29:29	Espyo	Rolf looks fine, but everybody else...
2014-01-26 18:29:54	Espyo	not like it's easy to make cartoons, specially stylized like EEE, into 3D games
2014-01-26 18:32:02	Espyo	it's so upsetting that Eddy's always smiling
2014-01-26 18:33:34	Espyo	d-d-dat chin!
2014-01-26 18:33:39	Espyo	wtf Kevin
2014-01-26 18:33:46	Espyo	even Eddy lampshaded it

2014-01-26 22:12:53	Espyo	woah
2014-01-26 22:12:57	Espyo	I really doubt I will
2014-01-26 22:13:00	Espyo	two reasons
2014-01-26 22:13:14	Espyo	for one thing, programming on a PC is different from programming something for iOS
2014-01-26 22:13:25	Espyo	secondly, I think iOS apps have to be on the store
2014-01-26 22:13:34	TehPehEhm	ok
2014-01-26 22:13:46	Espyo	and because this is not only fan work but also an engine, that would probably not be accepted

2014-01-26 22:18:41	Espyo	pretty pretty
2014-01-26 22:23:17	@J	I just realised how crazy the default set of test stuff is getting
2014-01-26 22:23:56	@J	it's weird, though, because whenever I make something new, I add it to the stuff, then remove it after, but leave all the old stuff as it is

2014-01-27 01:07:08	@PikFan	I think I'll play something now
2014-01-27 01:07:19	@PikFan	I'll switch, though

2014-01-27 01:07:26	Espyo	caught you before you left
2014-01-27 01:07:34	@PikFan	...yes?
2014-01-27 01:07:42	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:RecentChanges something minor, but patrol the missing edits, would you?
2014-01-27 01:07:48	Espyo	they're Pikmin 3 related, so...
2014-01-27 01:08:16	@PikFan	I will when I get on the laptop in a moment
2014-01-27 01:08:16	Espyo	...also, one of the edits is on the Treasure Hoard, claims the Seed of Greed is actually worth 70 Pokos, not 100
2014-01-27 01:08:21	Espyo	could you check please?
2014-01-27 01:08:23	Espyo	you have NTSC
2014-01-27 01:08:26	Espyo	I'll check on my GCN PAL

2014-01-27 01:12:13	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-27 01:12:17	Espyo	well, check them first, of course
2014-01-27 01:12:29	@PikFan	yeah :P
2014-01-27 01:12:50	Espyo	also, I missed you two times before
2014-01-27 01:12:55	Espyo	hence why I screamed your name before you left a third one
2014-01-27 01:13:06	Espyo	anyway, it's 70 Pokos on GCN PAL

2014-01-27 01:23:11	Espyo	both GCN and NPC! if you don't mind
2014-01-27 01:25:56	@PikFan	also 70
2014-01-27 01:26:23	Espyo	fair enough
2014-01-27 01:26:53	Espyo	I checked that anon's previous edits when he fixed my cave sublevel lists
2014-01-27 01:26:56	Espyo	and they all turned out to be true
2014-01-27 01:27:58	Espyo	so I didn't really suspect that anon to make a fake edit this time
2014-01-27 01:28:06	Espyo	but both the Treasure Hoard article and the Seed of Greed article agreed on 100
2014-01-27 01:28:13	Espyo	so something was suspicious
2014-01-27 01:28:44	Espyo	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Seed_of_Greed hehe
2014-01-27 01:28:46	Espyo	they haven't fix it
2014-01-27 01:28:56	Espyo	they have an image of real life chestnuts?!
2014-01-27 01:29:06	Espyo	and it's uglyly centered, too!
2014-01-27 01:32:34	Espyo	ok, going to bed now
2014-01-27 01:32:39	Espyo	wonder where we got the 100 from...
2014-01-27 01:32:47	@PikFan	wait
2014-01-27 01:32:51	Espyo	hm?
2014-01-27 01:33:17	@PikFan	remember how I was talking about taking the fruits menu and putting it into a navbox?
2014-01-27 01:33:24	Espyo	mhm?
2014-01-27 01:33:38	@PikFan	and you said that you'd need a capture card or something to take a picture of it?
2014-01-27 01:33:42	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-27 01:33:47	@PikFan	well, I can just upload it
2014-01-27 01:33:52	Espyo	oh, great
2014-01-27 01:34:07	@PikFan	using the same way I was able to get those P3 pictures up
2014-01-27 01:34:13	Espyo	right
2014-01-27 01:34:21	Espyo	but should we still extract the fruit icons from that screen?
2014-01-27 01:34:29	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-27 01:34:32	Espyo	and then make a navbox a bit like {{Exploration Kit}}?
2014-01-27 01:34:44	@PikFan	yeah, that's what I was thinking
2014-01-27 01:34:46	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Exploration_Kit (really like how that turned out)
2014-01-27 01:34:49	Espyo	ok then
2014-01-27 01:34:55	Espyo	you upload them somewhere, and I'll handle it tomorrow
2014-01-27 01:35:03	@PikFan	okay
2014-01-27 01:35:05	Espyo	not going to start any big project on the following days, so I might as well do that
2014-01-27 01:35:16	@PikFan	well... I have to find all the fruits first, though
2014-01-27 01:35:19	Espyo	by big project, I mean the animation system on the engine
2014-01-27 01:35:22	Espyo	oh, right
2014-01-27 01:35:29	Espyo	I thought you 100%d it already
2014-01-27 01:35:33	@PikFan	no
2014-01-27 01:35:37	@PikFan	not yet
2014-01-27 01:35:42	@PikFan	still stuck on Twilight River
2014-01-27 01:35:47	Espyo	fair enough
2014-01-27 01:35:51	Espyo	are they hidden? or hard to reach?
2014-01-27 01:35:55	@PikFan	nah
2014-01-27 01:35:57	Espyo	or is it just that there are loads of them?
2014-01-27 01:36:03	Espyo	or you haven't been playing that much?
2014-01-27 01:36:09	@PikFan	no, it's just my Pikmin keep dying
2014-01-27 01:36:14	Espyo	heh
2014-01-27 01:36:21	Espyo	that's a bit why I want to do a normal run first
2014-01-27 01:36:26	Espyo	and THEN I'll focus on a no-death run

2014-01-27 20:06:32	Pikpikmate	Hai
2014-01-27 20:11:27	Espyo	hey
2014-01-27 20:54:56	Espyo	ok, how would I go on about searching for all instances of "bomb rock" on the wiki?
2014-01-27 20:55:14	Espyo	there is no point of anything official that calls them "bomb rocks", with a space
2014-01-27 20:55:20	Espyo	in every instance, it's with a dash
2014-01-27 20:55:30	Espyo	so we should fix all erroneous instances on the wiki
2014-01-27 20:55:36	Espyo	but searching brings up "bomb-rock" as well...
2014-01-27 20:57:25	Pikpikmate	Oh, I remember that argument
2014-01-27 20:57:49	Pikpikmate	I asked the same thing but I was told it wasn't that big of a deal
2014-01-27 20:58:27	Pikpikmate	I was told that if I was editing an article with "bomb rock" in it and not "bomb-rock" to change it
2014-01-27 20:58:28	Espyo	it isn't, but because I have nothing else to do
2014-01-27 20:58:33	Espyo	might as well clear that point off
2014-01-27 20:59:04	Pikpikmate	But if I wasn't editing the article just leave it alone
2014-01-27 20:59:17	Espyo	hm
2014-01-27 20:59:26	Espyo	I must've misinterpreted it
2014-01-27 20:59:32	Pikpikmate	I think it's understood well enough
2014-01-27 20:59:34	Espyo	IIRC, you were doing some other project when you brought that up?
2014-01-27 21:00:16	Pikpikmate	I don't remember, I just remember asking the same thing and getting that answer
2014-01-27 21:01:02	Espyo	yeah, then I must've misinterpreted it
2014-01-27 21:01:11	Espyo	or I just didn't want you to distract yourself while you did that other thing?
2014-01-27 21:01:13	Espyo	dunno
2014-01-27 21:01:52	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search=%22bomb+rock%22&fulltext=Search
2014-01-27 21:02:07	@J	hmm, maybe that doesn't work
2014-01-27 21:02:23	@J	oh, or maybe it searches filenames too
2014-01-27 21:02:39	@J	no, it doesn't work
2014-01-27 21:03:14	Pikpikmate	Oh, uh, enemies that revive can be dragged by breadbugs and killed that way, right?
2014-01-27 21:04:18	Pikpikmate	I was just looking at a Japanese Pikmin 2 video and a "dead" Spotty Bulbear got dragged by a Breadbug and killed that way

2014-01-27 21:23:44	TehPehEhm	I know

2014-01-27 21:35:53	Espyo	oh, uh...
2014-01-27 21:35:57	Espyo	I think "bomb rock" in quotes works
2014-01-27 21:37:58	Espyo	it gives a lot of results, but it expands on the ones that actually have "bomb rock" with a space
2014-01-27 21:39:41	Espyo	well, if it gave what I wanted, then everything that isn't a filename has been replaced

2014-01-27 21:48:06	@J	that's only the main namespace
2014-01-27 21:48:09	Espyo	nor Hazard
2014-01-27 21:48:21	@J	of course, these might be filenames
2014-01-27 21:48:22	Espyo	...nor Hole of Heroes
2014-01-27 21:48:23	@J	oh...
2014-01-27 21:48:25	@J	and I forgot to

2014-01-27 21:48:27	@J	great
2014-01-27 21:48:35	@J	I forgot to check case-insensitively
2014-01-27 21:48:48	Espyo	well, try again, if you please
2014-01-27 21:49:08	Espyo	I also fixed some more some minutes ago, so...
2014-01-27 21:53:59	@J	I saw :{ today in some code, and then I couldn't stop seeing it as a sad face with a moustache, and there were suddenly loads of them wherever I looked
2014-01-27 21:54:52	Espyo	haha
2014-01-27 21:54:56	Espyo	I saw a sad moustache face right away
2014-01-27 21:55:01	Espyo	also a sad owl

2014-01-27 22:14:38	Espyo	...new?
2014-01-27 22:14:43	@J	not in the previous list
2014-01-27 22:14:49	Espyo	oh
2014-01-27 22:14:49	@J	should I check other namespaces?
2014-01-27 22:14:57	Espyo	so that was the whole list back there?
2014-01-27 22:15:00	@J	yeah
2014-01-27 22:15:05	@J	for the main namespace
2014-01-27 22:15:11	Espyo	almost looks like you cut it short after Testyo told you
2014-01-27 22:15:15	@J	nope
2014-01-27 22:15:21	@J	I pasted it all in one go
2014-01-27 22:15:25	@J	7 pages
2014-01-27 22:15:31	Espyo	ok then
2014-01-27 22:17:47	Espyo	ok, that's all then
2014-01-27 22:17:50	Espyo	outside of filenames
2014-01-27 22:17:58	Espyo	other than that, stuff out of the main namespace is like notes and such
2014-01-27 22:18:57	@J	okay

2014-01-28 00:33:09	@PikFan	I see
2014-01-28 00:33:14	Espyo	I thought I needed 0 clicks for regular Neverclick anyway
2014-01-28 00:33:19	@PikFan	...oh
2014-01-28 00:33:36	@PikFan	for regular Neverclick, you click the big cookie 15 times

2014-01-28 00:34:51	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-28 00:35:02	@PikFan	I see
2014-01-28 00:35:11	@PikFan	oh, I realized something
2014-01-28 00:35:35	@PikFan	it should be easier to get the Speed Baking achievements, since there are reindee
2014-01-28 00:35:38	@PikFan	*reindeer
2014-01-28 00:35:40	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-28 00:36:05	@PikFan	...I /could/ try
2014-01-28 00:36:15	@PikFan	at the expense of straining my fingers
2014-01-28 00:37:04	@PikFan	also how many HCs do you have
2014-01-28 00:37:45	Espyo	 4k
2014-01-28 00:37:46	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -4812.7 °F
2014-01-28 00:38:06	@PikFan	I see
2014-01-28 00:38:17	@PikFan	and there's something wrong with Testyo
2014-01-28 00:38:28	@PikFan	-4812.7 °F
2014-01-28 00:38:28	Testyo	-4812.7 °F = -2691.5 °C / -2418.35 K
2014-01-28 00:38:40	Espyo	yeah, I know
2014-01-28 00:38:42	Espyo	negative Kelvin
2014-01-28 00:38:46	Espyo	*shrug*
2014-01-28 00:38:51	@PikFan	no
2014-01-28 00:38:52	Espyo	too hard to fix
2014-01-28 00:38:54	@PikFan	not that
2014-01-28 00:39:13	Pikpikmate	wha
2014-01-28 00:39:26	@PikFan	it should be -481.27 °F, not -4812.7 °F
2014-01-28 00:39:27	Testyo	-481.27 °F = -285.15 °C / -12 K
2014-01-28 00:39:36	Pikpikmate	Temperature doesn't go down that low
2014-01-28 00:39:37	Espyo	really?
2014-01-28 00:39:41	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-28 00:39:42	Espyo	I know it doesn't, but it's too hard to fix
2014-01-28 00:39:45	Espyo	so...
2014-01-28 00:39:49	Espyo	 36 C
2014-01-28 00:39:50	Testyo	36 C = 96.8 °F / 309.15 K
2014-01-28 00:39:52	Espyo	that's body temperatyre
2014-01-28 00:39:55	Espyo	*temperature
2014-01-28 00:39:57	Espyo	is that right in F?
2014-01-28 00:40:06	@PikFan	yes, roughly
2014-01-28 00:40:28	Pikpikmate	 0 K is absolute zero isn't it?
2014-01-28 00:40:28	Testyo	0 K = -273.15 °C / -4884.7 °F
2014-01-28 00:40:33	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-28 00:40:36	Espyo	then how is 4K wrong?
2014-01-28 00:40:37	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -4812.7 °F
2014-01-28 00:40:42	Espyo	I can't see what went wrong here
2014-01-28 00:40:56	Pikpikmate	Fahrenheit seems really screwed up
2014-01-28 00:40:59	Espyo	how bizarre
2014-01-28 00:41:00	Espyo	^
2014-01-28 00:41:01	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-28 00:41:02	Espyo	so much ^
2014-01-28 00:41:20	@PikFan	the Fahrenheit shouldn't be in the negative /thousands/
2014-01-28 00:41:25	Espyo	I had to have a compeltely different system on these conversions JUST because of that
2014-01-28 00:41:28	Espyo	*completely
2014-01-28 00:41:37	Espyo	I really don't know what's wrong here
2014-01-28 00:41:51	@PikFan	hmmm
2014-01-28 00:41:54	@PikFan	100K
2014-01-28 00:41:55	Testyo	100 K = -173.15 °C / -3084.7 °F
2014-01-28 00:42:01	@PikFan	1000K
2014-01-28 00:42:02	Testyo	1000 K = 726.85 °C / 13115.3 °F
2014-01-28 00:42:27	@PikFan	yeah, the Fahrenheit values for Kelvin are badly messed up
2014-01-28 00:42:34	Espyo	:|
2014-01-28 00:42:55	@PikFan	they're 10 times what they should be
2014-01-28 00:44:12	Espyo	just ten?
2014-01-28 00:44:13	Espyo	oh phew
2014-01-28 00:44:37	@PikFan	note how there's only one place after the decimal for F
2014-01-28 00:44:45	@PikFan	when there should be 2
2014-01-28 00:44:48	@PikFan	right?
2014-01-28 00:45:14	Espyo	I think so?
2014-01-28 00:45:19	Espyo	I don't do Kelvin in my day-to-day life
2014-01-28 00:45:27	Espyo	not to mention Fahrenheit
2014-01-28 00:45:31	Espyo	 4 K
2014-01-28 00:45:31	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2014-01-28 00:45:35	Espyo	that right?
2014-01-28 00:45:39	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-28 00:46:00	Pikpikmate	What about Rankine?
2014-01-28 00:46:12	@PikFan	...what's that
2014-01-28 00:46:12	Espyo	._o
2014-01-28 00:46:22	Espyo	for everybody's sake that better not be an actual unit
2014-01-28 00:46:30	Pikpikmate	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_scale
2014-01-28 00:46:31	Pikpikmate	It is
2014-01-28 00:46:39	Pikpikmate	It's Fahrenheit's equal to Kelvin
2014-01-28 00:46:42	Espyo	nuts
2014-01-28 00:55:04	Pikpikmate	There are a few others too
2014-01-28 00:55:19	Pikpikmate	But the main four are Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin, and Rankine
2014-01-28 00:55:33	Espyo	hm
2014-01-28 00:57:35	Pikpikmate	I don't think I've EVER seen Rankine actually used though
2014-01-28 00:59:10	Espyo	same
2014-01-28 01:33:50	Espyo	ok, I tried one real quick
2014-01-28 01:33:54	Espyo	.../not/ gonna be easy
2014-01-28 01:36:00	Espyo	hey, I tried something else, and it looks ok
2014-01-28 01:36:49	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/fruit%201.png what do you think?
2014-01-28 01:44:25	Pikpikmate	Neat
2014-01-28 01:44:45	Espyo	PikFan: what do you think?
2014-01-28 01:45:00	Espyo	I had to use some filters to the image, so this isn't like a texture rip or anything
2014-01-28 01:45:04	Espyo	but I think it works nicely
2014-01-28 01:49:57	Pikpikmate	Oh, there's a Planck Temperature

2014-01-28 20:19:31	Espyo	that's a thing?

2014-01-28 20:20:11	Prezintenden	i really just wanted a longer HDMI but the cheapest one also had ethernet capability, apparently
2014-01-28 20:20:31	Espyo	that's super weird
2014-01-28 20:21:08	Prezintenden	i know right? i can kiiiiind of understand the use in it for TVs with online functions, even though that in itself is totally unnecessary, but beyond that?
2014-01-28 20:22:44	Prezintenden	yeah, no, can't connect
2014-01-28 20:22:53	Espyo	I figured as much
2014-01-28 20:23:20	Espyo	but it's like a sewage pipe that also channels conditioned air
2014-01-28 20:23:22	Espyo	it makes little sense
2014-01-28 20:23:30	Espyo	have you google'd around to make sure that's an actual thing?
2014-01-28 20:24:15	Prezintenden	it's "official amazon.com" product and the reviews say it worked... wasn't really worried on it working or not because i don't need it... idk
2014-01-28 20:25:27	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-28 20:25:55	Prezintenden	well short google look-see says "first gen" so I'm guessing nobody has done anything with it yet
2014-01-28 20:26:36	Prezintenden	okay uh that post is from 2011, guess it flipped, go figure
2014-01-28 20:26:41	Prezintenden	*flopped

2014-01-28 21:21:41	PikFan	oh, nice
2014-01-28 21:21:49	PikFan	I can't look at it now though
2014-01-28 21:21:56	PikFan	(school)
2014-01-28 21:22:42	PikFan	so you're going to do that thing with the Pikmin 2 treasures, as well?

2014-01-28 21:31:30	Espyo	I was dining...
2014-01-28 21:31:35	Espyo	Prezintenden: Wolpole?
2014-01-28 21:32:54	Prezintenden	Wogpoles are renamed Wolpole in P3
2014-01-28 21:33:04	Espyo	yeesh
2014-01-28 21:33:27	Espyo	first Wollywogs are Wollyhops, now this
2014-01-28 21:33:59	Prezintenden	"These creatures are called Wolpoles in the New Play Control! Pikmin 2 released in PAL. " according to wikia
2014-01-28 21:34:22	Prezintenden	yeah ours has the same
2014-01-28 21:34:40	Prezintenden	guessing that means we don't make a new article
2014-01-28 21:37:01	Espyo	right
2014-01-28 21:39:45	Prezintenden	they made the wolpole ai really stupid by the way. like waaaay stupid
2014-01-28 21:40:02	Prezintenden	which is fitting I guess because it has such a low reward
2014-01-28 21:41:08	Espyo	yeah, they were really not worth it in Pikmin 2
2014-01-28 21:41:13	Espyo	but it still made that enemy unique
2014-01-28 21:41:30	Espyo	it's not really meant to be an enemy you bring back for reward, it's meant to just be like a little detail guy thing
2014-01-28 21:41:45	Espyo	also there's some challenge in killing it the first time, for the Piklopedia
2014-01-28 21:43:27	Prezintenden	that's pretty deep, I never thought of it that way. But i think if you look at it like that then it still doesn't fit, because chasing down the blue and red flitterbies rewards you rather immensely. there are no "useless" enemies in Pikmin
2014-01-28 21:43:40	Espyo	I suppose
2014-01-28 21:43:58	Espyo	but you need more than 10 or so Wogpoles to be worth it
2014-01-28 21:44:07	Espyo	the are only ever like 3 together or something
2014-01-28 21:45:28	Prezintenden	hmmm. I'm surprised actually, they could've turned it into a tough enemy for the mission mode where you have to kill all enemies in time attack
2014-01-28 21:45:42	Espyo	hm, yeah
2014-01-28 22:02:08	Prezintenden	has pikfan worked on the notes left by olimar on pikmin 3 yet?
2014-01-28 22:02:15	Espyo	by Olimar?
2014-01-28 22:02:16	Prezintenden	*in pikmin 3
2014-01-28 22:02:23	Espyo	didn't even know he had notes there
2014-01-28 22:02:28	Espyo	but he did some of Brittany's
2014-01-28 22:02:30	Prezintenden	he leaves these yellow text files lying around and you collect them
2014-01-28 22:02:47	Espyo	oh, that's what those are
2014-01-28 22:02:47	Prezintenden	brittany's? you mean on the fruit?
2014-01-28 22:02:50	Espyo	nope, he hasn't started
2014-01-28 22:02:54	Espyo	yep, the fruits
2014-01-28 22:03:06	Prezintenden	okay I'll do that now
2014-01-28 22:03:25	Prezintenden	though I never even got close to collecting all... hur
2014-01-28 22:03:37	Prezintenden	also my batteries just ran out, jesus
2014-01-28 22:03:47	Prezintenden	gamepad time yaaaaaaaay...
2014-01-28 22:03:50	Espyo	heh
2014-01-28 22:09:32	@J	Espyo: those fruits, some have noticeable borders where you cropped too much, and the background's sort of visible in a couple, but they mostly look okay
2014-01-28 22:09:44	@J	are they just extracted from screenshots?
2014-01-28 22:09:49	Espyo	just extracted
2014-01-28 22:09:58	Espyo	shouldn't the border be noticeable on those in which I didn't crop too much?
2014-01-28 22:10:19	Espyo	and how is the background visible? small remnants with very low opacity?
2014-01-28 22:10:43	@J	no, I mean part of the image is cropped off
2014-01-28 22:11:04	@J	well, is the background black?
2014-01-28 22:11:14	Espyo	it's not black
2014-01-28 22:11:17	@J	hmm
2014-01-28 22:11:21	Espyo	it's some shades of blue
2014-01-28 22:11:25	@J	well, is it dark?
2014-01-28 22:11:37	Espyo	eh... some lines are lighter than others
2014-01-28 22:12:19	@J	but anyway, look at Cupid's Grenade
2014-01-28 22:12:19	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin_3_Fruit_File.jpg
2014-01-28 22:12:24	@J	that's the most noticeable one
2014-01-28 22:12:29	Espyo	Cupid's Grenade is a perfect mess
2014-01-28 22:12:33	Espyo	I am super displeased with it
2014-01-28 22:12:37	@J	hmm, I see
2014-01-28 22:12:39	Espyo	it's so small — that doesn't help
2014-01-28 22:12:42	@J	how did you do it?
2014-01-28 22:12:51	Espyo	kind of a complicated process... or not
2014-01-28 22:12:55	Espyo	I used some Paint.NET filters
2014-01-28 22:13:13	Espyo	one converts a certain color to alpha
2014-01-28 22:13:24	Espyo	given a range of hue, lighting and saturation
2014-01-28 22:13:39	Espyo	so I used that to remove the blues from the background
2014-01-28 22:13:52	Espyo	that leaves me with a bit of an aliased image
2014-01-28 22:14:07	Espyo	so I used another filter that smooths out aliasing
2014-01-28 22:14:24	Espyo	I can't say for sure whether the actual images have an outline
2014-01-28 22:14:39	Espyo	but I just pressed heavy on the anti-aliasing thing so that no outlines existed
2014-01-28 22:14:41	Espyo	it was better that way
2014-01-28 22:14:46	@J	mm
2014-01-28 22:14:56	@J	I guess they would look better done manually, but it's a lot of work
2014-01-28 22:15:04	@J	might be worth it just for Cupid's Grenade, though
2014-01-28 22:15:07	Espyo	I disagree
2014-01-28 22:15:15	Espyo	but for Cupid's Grenade, I might have to, yeah...
2014-01-28 22:15:25	@J	you disagree with what?
2014-01-28 22:15:29	Espyo	doing it manually with leave a pretty aliased image
2014-01-28 22:15:31	Espyo	blech
2014-01-28 22:15:35	Espyo	*would leave
2014-01-28 22:15:38	@J	no, doing it properly manuallyl
2014-01-28 22:15:40	@J	*-l
2014-01-28 22:15:53	Espyo	properly = GIMP?
2014-01-28 22:15:57	Espyo	not that good with GIMP as I could be
2014-01-28 22:16:08	Prezintenden	It's not hard it just takes ages
2014-01-28 22:16:10	@J	I don't really know about other programs
2014-01-28 22:16:23	Espyo	either way, what tools were you thinking of?
2014-01-28 22:16:25	@J	but yeah, I don't mean just taking an eraser and doing it pixel by pixel
2014-01-28 22:16:42	Espyo	actually, I /did/ have to use GIMP to blur some of them
2014-01-28 22:16:45	@J	you use the path tool, draw a path around the object, then delete everything outside it
2014-01-28 22:16:53	Espyo	stuff like the watermelon is partially obscured by the blue number
2014-01-28 22:16:59	Espyo	so I had to smudge it out to make it round
2014-01-28 22:17:08	Espyo	oh, right
2014-01-28 22:17:10	@J	possibly with some feathering on the selection to blur the edges a little
2014-01-28 22:17:10	Espyo	I forgot about that
2014-01-28 22:17:18	Espyo	and I even saw a video tutorial about that some days ago
2014-01-28 22:17:26	Espyo	I'll give it a try later, actually
2014-01-28 22:17:29	@J	to avoid the borders, GIMP has autocrop
2014-01-28 22:17:38	Espyo	I mean, I'm no GIMP pro, but I didn't quite mean I suck at it
2014-01-28 22:17:40	@J	but maybe you used something like that and I'm just seeing things that aren't there
2014-01-28 22:20:01	Espyo	www.pikminwiki.com/Hypnotic_Platter#Collecting_the_treasure_in_the_PAL_version ok, are those infoboxes floating correctly?
2014-01-28 22:20:18	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Hypnotic_Platter#Collecting_the_treasure_in_the_PAL_version (clickable?)
2014-01-28 22:22:09	@J	hmm, I can't even tell what fruits the Dapper Blob and Stellar Extrusion are meant to be
2014-01-28 22:22:36	@J	the latter looks vaguely like a star fruit, but the wrong shape
2014-01-28 22:22:45	Espyo	same
2014-01-28 22:23:03	Espyo	>When viewed in the Treasure Hoard, the dried blue paint under it is missing, and the tube of paint is floating.
2014-01-28 22:23:04	@J	but then, you hate fruit, so you probably don't know what most of these are
2014-01-28 22:23:11	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Decorative_Goo
2014-01-28 22:23:19	@J	infoboxes look fine to me
2014-01-28 22:23:20	Espyo	ok, the tube is very much not floating
2014-01-28 22:23:24	@J	but there are 2 sets of game icons
2014-01-28 22:23:28	Espyo	not the infoboxes that are problematic
2014-01-28 22:23:32	Espyo	the image for the location
2014-01-28 22:23:35	Espyo	it's in line with the second infobox
2014-01-28 22:23:58	@J	wait, what are you saying?
2014-01-28 22:24:00	Espyo	hey, just because I hate fruit doesn't mean I can't love it
2014-01-28 22:24:07	@J	it very much does
2014-01-28 22:24:27	Espyo	ok, the map that represents where the Hypnotic Platter is
2014-01-28 22:24:35	Espyo	is after the text, and after a bit of a space
2014-01-28 22:24:42	@J	...I didn't even read you saying 'very much' before I said it
2014-01-28 22:24:43	Espyo	it's aligned with the second infobox, vertically
2014-01-28 22:24:45	@J	weird coincidence
2014-01-28 22:24:47	Espyo	hah
2014-01-28 22:24:54	Espyo	maybe you did, and it was subconscious
2014-01-28 22:24:57	@J	maybe
2014-01-28 22:25:04	@J	but it seems like it was in reply to that now
2014-01-28 22:25:17	Espyo	it does
2014-01-28 22:26:10	Espyo	am I going to have to get the US Pikmin 2 ISO to check if it's floating there...?
2014-01-28 22:28:04	@J	it looks like something's clear:ing something, but I can't find anything
2014-01-28 22:28:35	Espyo	yeah...
2014-01-28 22:32:08	@J	okay, something weird is definitely going on
2014-01-28 22:32:19	@J	if you remove the {{clear}}, it goes over the top of the notes section
2014-01-28 22:32:27	Espyo	wow
2014-01-28 22:34:43	Prezintenden	test
2014-01-28 22:35:06	Prezintenden	oh you can already see it in the command line
2014-01-28 22:35:31	Prezintenden	is this colur okay for you? want to make it easier to read
2014-01-28 22:35:37	Espyo	it's fine for me
2014-01-28 22:36:19	Espyo	testing
2014-01-28 22:36:27	Espyo	ok, white background doesn't make much of a difference
2014-01-28 22:37:42	Prezintenden	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin_Behavior_%28Exploration_Notes%29
2014-01-28 22:37:49	Prezintenden	I'm impressed, did not expect that
2014-01-28 22:39:44	@J	hmm, you have to log in to edit Wikia now?
2014-01-28 22:40:05	Espyo	hm
2014-01-28 22:40:08	Espyo	yeah, I believe you do
2014-01-28 22:42:21	Espyo	"Collecting the treasure in the PAL version" or "Collecting the treasure on the PAL version"...?
2014-01-28 22:46:46	Prezintenden	both seem viable
2014-01-28 22:53:02	@J	I would say 'in'
2014-01-28 22:53:36	Espyo	too late
2014-01-28 22:53:47	@J	meh, doesn't matter too much
2014-01-28 22:53:54	Espyo	besides, it's possible to play Pikmin 2 will sitting on top of a PAL version disc
2014-01-28 22:54:03	@J	when I think about it a certain way, 'on' sounds fine, but then again it doesn't
2014-01-28 22:58:05	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/test.html
2014-01-28 22:58:08	@J	okay, explain this to me
2014-01-28 22:58:34	Espyo	yyyyyyyyep
2014-01-28 23:01:10	@J	is that what floats are supposed to do?
2014-01-28 23:04:50	Espyo	I honestly don't know
2014-01-28 23:04:59	Espyo	but I would guess no
2014-01-28 23:05:03	@J	...put the infoboxes below the image?
2014-01-28 23:05:11	@J	it might magically magic itself into being fixed
2014-01-28 23:05:13	Espyo	then again... HTML is always right...
2014-01-28 23:06:32	@J	also you didn't fix the game icons yet
2014-01-28 23:08:30	Espyo	I was never meant to!
2014-01-28 23:08:48	@J	lies
2014-01-28 23:08:54	@J	[22:23:24] @J but there are 2 sets of game icons
2014-01-28 23:09:08	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/rss.png
2014-01-28 23:09:16	@J	great, now there are 2 things wrong with that number
2014-01-28 23:10:18	Espyo	hehe
2014-01-28 23:10:33	Espyo	those two sets have existed for months now
2014-01-28 23:10:39	Espyo	and you must've been the one responsible for fixing them
2014-01-28 23:10:44	Espyo	since you're the one who knows how they work
2014-01-28 23:15:55	@J	there's an infobox argument
2014-01-28 23:16:00	@J	probably
2014-01-28 23:17:11	@J	...oh
2014-01-28 23:17:15	@J	it's still in the todo list
2014-01-28 23:17:36	@J	a clash=y parameter to put ‘(<type>)’ after the infobox title, for pages with multiple infoboxes (see Sunseed Berry - that would have ‘Sunseed Berry (treasure)’ and ‘Sunseed Berry (fruit)’)
2014-01-28 23:17:36	@J	also forces it not to use {{game icons}} - this breaks things

2014-01-30 01:51:46	@PikFan	Espyo, it didn't work
2014-01-30 01:51:53	Espyo	...?
2014-01-30 01:51:55	Espyo	is it a 404?
2014-01-30 01:51:59	@PikFan	yes
2014-01-30 01:52:02	Espyo	oh
2014-01-30 01:52:02	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-30 01:52:05	@PikFan	(how ironic)
2014-01-30 01:52:09	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikmin%203%20fruits.7z
2014-01-30 01:52:18	Espyo	oh... I made it a 7z this time
2014-01-30 01:52:25	Espyo	yeah, that was yesterday's file
2014-01-30 01:52:32	Espyo	the images I ripped didn't look as good
2014-01-30 01:52:36	Espyo	but today I tried again
2014-01-30 01:52:39	Espyo	and they're looking a lot better
2014-01-30 01:52:43	@PikFan	...ugh
2014-01-30 01:52:53	@PikFan	apparently the WinZip free trial has expired
2014-01-30 01:52:57	@PikFan	so I can't look at it
2014-01-30 01:53:34	@PikFan	what should I open it with?
2014-01-30 01:53:35	Espyo	...
2014-01-30 01:53:44	Espyo	what operative system do you have? windows 98?
2014-01-30 01:53:50	@PikFan	windows 7
2014-01-30 01:53:57	Espyo	oh good
2014-01-30 01:53:59	Espyo	hang on then
2014-01-30 01:54:21	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikmin%203%20fruits.zip extract this one
2014-01-30 01:54:43	@PikFan	what do I open it with
2014-01-30 01:54:48	Espyo	right click, extract
2014-01-30 01:55:13	@PikFan	there's no extract...?
2014-01-30 01:55:32	Espyo	impossible
2014-01-30 01:55:49	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-30 01:55:55	@PikFan	well, there's nothing that says "Extract"
2014-01-30 01:55:56	Espyo	just double click it
2014-01-30 01:56:21	@PikFan	I got a window that says Opening Pikmin 3 fruits.zip
2014-01-30 01:56:55	Espyo	...
2014-01-30 01:57:01	Espyo	is your windows 7 32 bit or 64 bit?
2014-01-30 01:57:09	@PikFan	I don't know
2014-01-30 01:57:18	Espyo	right click my computer, click properties
2014-01-30 01:57:20	Espyo	should say there
2014-01-30 01:58:08	@PikFan	...
2014-01-30 01:58:32	@PikFan	do you mean start
2014-01-30 01:58:43	Espyo	yeah, on the start menu
2014-01-30 01:58:56	@PikFan	uh
2014-01-30 01:59:07	@PikFan	doesn't say anything about that
2014-01-30 01:59:27	Espyo	...if you right click my computer, doesn't it have properties, at the bottom?
2014-01-30 01:59:29	@PikFan	that is, no 32- or 64-bit
2014-01-30 01:59:36	Espyo	oh
2014-01-30 01:59:37	@PikFan	yes, I clicked it
2014-01-30 01:59:52	@PikFan	but the properties window say nothing about it
2014-01-30 01:59:58	@PikFan	*says
2014-01-30 02:00:10	Espyo	on the "system" section of the window that opens
2014-01-30 02:00:15	Espyo	there's "System type"
2014-01-30 02:00:42	@PikFan	...there's no "system" section
2014-01-30 02:01:14	Espyo	a big window opened, didn't it?
2014-01-30 02:01:16	@PikFan	the sections are Taskbar, Start Menu, and Toolbars
2014-01-30 02:01:20	@PikFan	...no
2014-01-30 02:01:24	@PikFan	a small window
2014-01-30 02:01:24	Espyo	...
2014-01-30 02:01:39	Espyo	I said right click my computer, which is on the start menu
2014-01-30 02:01:47	Espyo	or rather, "computer"
2014-01-30 02:01:50	@PikFan	OH
2014-01-30 02:01:52	Espyo	changed name again... good grief windows
2014-01-30 02:02:30	@PikFan	okay, it's 64-bit
2014-01-30 02:03:24	Espyo	ok then
2014-01-30 02:03:38	Espyo	http://www.7-zip.org/
2014-01-30 02:03:45	Espyo	where it says download .msi, click it
2014-01-30 02:03:50	Espyo	on the green table
2014-01-30 02:04:08	Espyo	we'll be installing 7-zip, which is infinite times better than win zip
2014-01-30 02:04:16	Espyo	win zip is old, it's paid, and it's poor
2014-01-30 02:04:20	Espyo	a bit like wikia
2014-01-30 02:04:28	Espyo	so get rid of that wikia in your computer and install a wiki
2014-01-30 02:04:42	Espyo	or don't get rid of it, but at least install windows 7
2014-01-30 02:04:49	Espyo	*install 7-zip
2014-01-30 02:04:49	@PikFan	...except this ISN'T my computer
2014-01-30 02:04:54	Espyo	.......
2014-01-30 02:04:59	Espyo	install it anyway, it's useful
2014-01-30 02:05:06	Espyo	apparently it's the only way to open zip files anyway
2014-01-30 02:05:11	@PikFan	it's my MOM'S computer
2014-01-30 02:05:13	Espyo	if you say there's no "extract" option
2014-01-30 02:05:45	Espyo	ok, maybe I just don't know what the name of the option is
2014-01-30 02:05:52	Espyo	tell you what, google "how to unzip a file windows 7"
2014-01-30 02:05:56	Espyo	that should tell you everything
2014-01-30 02:07:44	@PikFan	ugh, this would be much easier if it wasn't a .zip file
2014-01-30 02:07:55	@PikFan	oh well
2014-01-30 02:08:31	Espyo	a .zip file is the absolute easiest file to unzip
2014-01-30 02:08:39	Espyo	in that windows xp and above are naturally able to unzip it
2014-01-30 02:10:40	@PikFan	aaaaaaaagh
2014-01-30 02:11:02	@PikFan	YT videos keep saying files
2014-01-30 02:11:08	@PikFan	but all I have is that link
2014-01-30 02:11:17	Espyo	...
2014-01-30 02:11:26	Espyo	uh... you're meant to download the file on the link onto the hard drive
2014-01-30 02:11:32	@PikFan	...
2014-01-30 02:16:29	@PikFan	I
2014-01-30 02:16:31	@PikFan	can't
2014-01-30 02:16:33	@PikFan	open
2014-01-30 02:16:33	@PikFan	it
2014-01-30 02:17:03	@PikFan	I'm really frustrated
2014-01-30 02:17:08	Espyo	did you save it already?
2014-01-30 02:17:13	@PikFan	yes
2014-01-30 02:17:21	Espyo	and went to where the file is?
2014-01-30 02:17:25	@PikFan	yes
2014-01-30 02:17:26	Espyo	and still can't extract it?
2014-01-30 02:17:31	@PikFan	nope
2014-01-30 02:17:37	@PikFan	right clicked it
2014-01-30 02:17:39	@PikFan	no extract
2014-01-30 02:17:45	Espyo	...
2014-01-30 02:17:53	Espyo	winzip must be interfering with the native extractor
2014-01-30 02:18:03	Espyo	winzip /should/ be extinct by now
2014-01-30 02:18:08	@PikFan	this isn't worth the effort
2014-01-30 02:18:14	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-30 02:18:18	Espyo	don't you have a computer of your own?
2014-01-30 02:18:33	@PikFan	when I try to open it, I get a pop-up saying "Your WinZip trial has expired!"
2014-01-30 02:18:37	@PikFan	it always appears
2014-01-30 02:18:45	@PikFan	whenever I try to open it
2014-01-30 02:18:56	Espyo	yep, it's winzip's fault
2014-01-30 02:19:15	Espyo	I'll just compile them into an image then
2014-01-30 02:19:15	Espyo	eesh
2014-01-30 02:20:05	@PikFan	I don't get why technology has to be so frustrating and confusing
2014-01-30 02:20:19	@PikFan	*sigh*
2014-01-30 02:20:33	Espyo	blame windows
2014-01-30 02:20:51	@PikFan	or rather, winzip
2014-01-30 02:21:53	Espyo	no no
2014-01-30 02:21:54	Espyo	blame windows
2014-01-30 02:22:02	@PikFan	heh, okay
2014-01-30 02:22:20	Espyo	while you wait for me to do this, know that an interesting regional difference has been found in Pikmin 2
2014-01-30 02:22:33	@PikFan	really?
2014-01-30 02:22:36	@PikFan	what is it?
2014-01-30 02:23:54	Espyo	the Decorative Goo, if seen on the Treasure Hoard, is /floating/ above ground
2014-01-30 02:24:03	Espyo	it's normal on the PAL version
2014-01-30 02:24:10	@PikFan	whaaaaaat
2014-01-30 02:24:12	Espyo	but floating on the US (dunno about Japan)
2014-01-30 02:24:13	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-30 02:24:19	Espyo	I even took a screenshot and put it on TCRF
2014-01-30 02:24:26	Espyo	naturally I also put that info on [[Decorative Goo]]
2014-01-30 02:24:30	Espyo	but no screenshot; no need
2014-01-30 02:25:08	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/fruits.png ok, NOW you'll be able to see them
2014-01-30 02:25:14	Espyo	not one by one, and no transparency, but here they are
2014-01-30 02:25:25	Espyo	they're also not aligned, I just mashed them in together on a single image real quick
2014-01-30 02:28:50	@PikFan	interesting
2014-01-30 02:29:26	@PikFan	so you think you'll be able to create a navbox out of this?
2014-01-30 02:29:33	Espyo	no problem
2014-01-30 02:29:38	@PikFan	yay
2014-01-30 02:29:46	Espyo	do you see any texture that looks wrong, even in the slightest?
2014-01-30 02:31:42	@PikFan	nope, looks good
2014-01-30 02:32:03	Espyo	it's sometimes possible to see some minor cropping issues
2014-01-30 02:32:07	Espyo	because of the way I used to crop
2014-01-30 02:32:16	Espyo	it's very hard to smooth it up
2014-01-30 02:32:27	Espyo	but it's so hard to see, it's not worth worrying about
2014-01-30 02:32:34	@PikFan	well... Dawn Pustules (green grapes) look a bit scratchy
2014-01-30 02:32:51	Espyo	yeah...
2014-01-30 02:32:59	Espyo	and the orange thing with a derp on top
2014-01-30 02:33:02	Espyo	looks very blocky
2014-01-30 02:33:04	Espyo	like low-poly
2014-01-30 02:33:11	@PikFan	Pocked Airhead?
2014-01-30 02:33:13	Espyo	looks like it's made of lines instead of circles
2014-01-30 02:33:14	Espyo	yeah, that
2014-01-30 02:33:25	Espyo	again, it's hard to smooth it
2014-01-30 02:33:31	Espyo	but in the end, I really don't think it matters
2014-01-30 02:33:31	@PikFan	hm, let me see the original
2014-01-30 02:33:46	Espyo	people would have to /purposely/ take close looks to the textures in order to spot these problems
2014-01-30 02:33:50	Espyo	the overall idea is perfectly fine
2014-01-30 02:34:12	@PikFan	yeah, it's supposed to be rounder
2014-01-30 02:34:16	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-30 02:34:18	Espyo	but oh well
2014-01-30 02:34:21	@PikFan	but it's fine
2014-01-30 02:34:45	Espyo	this will do until we can either rip textures from a running game by reading the memory, or until we can extract them from the game's files
2014-01-30 02:34:49	Espyo	(read: in 2024)
2014-01-30 02:34:50	@PikFan	hmm
2014-01-30 02:35:16	@PikFan	the Portable Sunset (persimmon) has a corner
2014-01-30 02:35:24	@PikFan	at the top-left
2014-01-30 02:35:37	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-30 02:35:41	Espyo	looks jagged
2014-01-30 02:35:46	Espyo	hm, not sure if it's worth redoing...
2014-01-30 02:35:59	@PikFan	you could redo it later
2014-01-30 02:36:07	@PikFan	overall, it looks good
2014-01-30 02:36:13	Espyo	I'll wait to see what J has to say
2014-01-30 02:36:14	@PikFan	just very minor errors
2014-01-30 02:36:18	Espyo	he has more experience with GIMP
2014-01-30 02:36:29	Espyo	he might be up to retry some of them, give some tips, etc.
2014-01-30 02:36:45	Espyo	other than that, you know the Utter Scrap?
2014-01-30 02:36:55	Espyo	until now, it was only possible to see the letters O, N and E
2014-01-30 02:37:04	@PikFan	yeah, how it's fictional? and has the 1-up?
2014-01-30 02:37:07	Espyo	how has nobody thought of ripping the texture?
2014-01-30 02:37:12	Espyo	to take a perfect look?
2014-01-30 02:37:14	Espyo	I did it yesterday
2014-01-30 02:37:19	Espyo	and it's definitely a one-up gag
2014-01-30 02:37:24	@PikFan	yeah
2014-01-30 02:37:31	Espyo	but now it's a lot easier to see
2014-01-30 02:38:43	@PikFan	also, don't mean to nag, but
2014-01-30 02:38:56	@PikFan	you forgot to add the game icon to the fruit infobox
2014-01-30 02:39:17	@PikFan	but you were busy with the treasures
2014-01-30 02:39:51	Espyo	me and J are still trying to fix it
2014-01-30 02:39:57	@PikFan	oh
2014-01-30 02:40:00	Espyo	because as it turns out, infoboxes are /insanely/ broken
2014-01-30 02:40:12	@PikFan	...really?
2014-01-30 02:40:32	@PikFan	what do you mean, 'broken'?
2014-01-30 02:40:36	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Sunseed_Berry
2014-01-30 02:40:46	Espyo	you see the "Collecting the treasure" section?
2014-01-30 02:40:51	@PikFan	well yes, I know that
2014-01-30 02:40:51	Espyo	notice how the image is below the text
2014-01-30 02:40:58	Espyo	if you check the source, the image is actually /before/ the text
2014-01-30 02:41:07	Espyo	the fruit infobox is actually pushing the image down, go figure
2014-01-30 02:41:19	@PikFan	wait what
2014-01-30 02:41:42	@PikFan	there's no "Collecting the treasure" section
2014-01-30 02:41:49	@PikFan	you must be confused with another article
2014-01-30 02:41:52	Espyo	sorry, "In Pikmin 2"
2014-01-30 02:42:15	@PikFan	whoa
2014-01-30 02:42:17	@PikFan	you're right
2014-01-30 02:42:36	Espyo	J made a quick test with CSS and HTML on a simple web page
2014-01-30 02:42:43	Espyo	and turns out that that's just the way CSS works
2014-01-30 02:42:55	Espyo	i.e. that's just the way stuff aligned works
2014-01-30 02:43:02	Espyo	because CSS is psychotic
2014-01-30 02:43:16	Espyo	gotta be heading off to bed, it's late
2014-01-30 02:43:30	@PikFan	okay
2014-01-30 02:43:32	@PikFan	night
2014-01-30 02:43:42	Espyo	hm, you never answered
2014-01-30 02:43:46	Espyo	don't you have a computer of your own?
2014-01-30 02:43:54	@PikFan	yeah, my desktop
2014-01-30 02:43:59	Espyo	why not use that?
2014-01-30 02:44:00	@PikFan	haven't used it in a while
2014-01-30 02:44:07	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-01-30 02:44:16	Espyo	well, on your mom's laptop, you're pretty much limited
2014-01-30 02:44:19	Espyo	can't install anything
2014-01-30 02:44:27	Espyo	can't even unzip anything, it seems
2014-01-30 02:44:28	@PikFan	well
2014-01-30 02:44:42	@PikFan	this is my mom's other laptop
2014-01-30 02:44:56	@PikFan	she stopped using it once she got her new laptop
2014-01-30 02:45:11	Espyo	so for all intents and purposes, it's your computer now?
2014-01-30 02:45:34	@PikFan	it still belongs to her, but I use it
2014-01-30 02:45:40	Espyo	hm
2014-01-30 02:46:06	Espyo	still, at least tell her that winzip needs uninstalling, because it's stopping files from being extracted
2014-01-30 02:46:18	@PikFan	okay
2014-01-30 02:46:57	Espyo	don't think there's anything else I need to talk about...
2014-01-30 02:47:16	@PikFan	anything CC related?
2014-01-30 02:47:28	Espyo	CC?
2014-01-30 02:47:34	Espyo	oh
2014-01-30 02:47:41	Espyo	did I say before that I 100%'d it?
2014-01-30 02:47:44	Espyo	because I did
2014-01-30 02:47:49	Espyo	now I'm just making cookies casually
2014-01-30 02:47:53	Espyo	so I can be ready for the next update
2014-01-30 02:47:59	@PikFan	oh
2014-01-30 02:48:01	@PikFan	hm
2014-01-30 02:48:13	@PikFan	so I promised myself I wouldn't cheat during this session
2014-01-30 02:48:19	@PikFan	...but I broke my promise
2014-01-30 02:48:46	Espyo	heh
2014-01-30 02:48:49	Espyo	impatient
2014-01-30 02:49:01	@PikFan	I did the auto click GCs/auto click big cookie during Click Frenzy/auto click reindeer
2014-01-30 02:49:09	@PikFan	yes, I'm very impatient
2014-01-30 02:49:18	Espyo	might as well just give yourself 10 quints and be done with it
2014-01-30 02:49:30	@PikFan	hah, that was only 1 night
2014-01-30 02:49:44	@PikFan	and then I stopped
2014-01-30 02:49:53	Espyo	hm
2014-01-30 02:50:08	@PikFan	but my CpS is almost 800 bil
2014-01-30 02:50:25	Espyo	 670 bil, withered
2014-01-30 02:50:33	@PikFan	wow
2014-01-30 02:50:35	Espyo	took me around 50 hours to get here on this session
2014-01-30 02:50:43	Espyo	now I'll reset when I manage 50 quint
2014-01-30 02:50:49	Espyo	so I can get 50k HC
2014-01-30 02:50:50	Testyo	50 K = -223.15 °C / -369.67 °F
2014-01-30 02:50:51	@PikFan	let's see... ACs cost 230,490,985,962,557,820 128 cookies
2014-01-30 02:50:59	@PikFan	er
2014-01-30 02:51:04	@PikFan	230,490,985,962,557,820 cookies
2014-01-30 02:51:10	@PikFan	I have 128 ACs
2014-01-30 02:51:13	@PikFan	oh, heh
2014-01-30 02:51:15	@PikFan	128
2014-01-30 02:51:21	Espyo	heh
2014-01-30 02:52:30	@PikFan	let's see
2014-01-30 02:52:54	@PikFan	in this session, I've baked 1,914,668,199,257,058,000 cookies
2014-01-30 02:53:13	@PikFan	all time, 4,073,465,499,765,585,400 cookies
2014-01-30 02:53:56	@PikFan	I'll reset when I get enough cookies for 3k HCs
2014-01-30 02:53:56	Testyo	3 K = -270.15 °C / -454.27 °F
2014-01-30 02:54:08	Espyo	right
2014-01-30 02:54:19	Espyo	though 2k is what you need for all upgrades
2014-01-30 02:54:19	Testyo	2 K = -271.15 °C / -456.07 °F
2014-01-30 02:54:32	Espyo	also, unless I'm seeing it wrong, you have enough for almost 6k HCs
2014-01-30 02:54:32	Testyo	6 K = -267.15 °C / -448.87 °F
2014-01-30 02:54:45	@PikFan	you're seeing it wrong
2014-01-30 02:54:52	@PikFan	http://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Heavenly_chips?useskin=monobook
2014-01-30 02:55:05	Espyo	but
2014-01-30 02:55:11	Espyo	 1 quint is roughly 1k HCs
2014-01-30 02:55:11	Testyo	1 K = -272.15 °C / -457.87 °F
2014-01-30 02:55:29	@PikFan	for 6k HCs, I need 18 quint cookies
2014-01-30 02:55:29	Testyo	6 K = -267.15 °C / -448.87 °F
2014-01-30 02:55:35	Espyo	whaa
2014-01-30 02:55:58	@PikFan	let's see
2014-01-30 02:56:03	Espyo	how can that be possible?
2014-01-30 02:56:09	Espyo	I have 4k and never made more than 10 quint
2014-01-30 02:56:09	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2014-01-30 02:56:14	@PikFan	6(6 + 1) / 2
2014-01-30 02:56:34	@PikFan	= 21
2014-01-30 02:56:49	@PikFan	...odd
2014-01-30 02:56:56	@PikFan	OH
2014-01-30 02:57:02	@PikFan	woops, I did it wrong
2014-01-30 02:57:21	Espyo	there's a calculator right there
2014-01-30 02:57:28	Espyo	does all the work for you, so you don't have to do the equations
2014-01-30 02:57:52	@PikFan	6000(6000 + 1) / 2 = 18,003,000
2014-01-30 02:58:00	Espyo	:|
2014-01-30 02:58:04	Espyo	that sounds really sketchy
2014-01-30 02:58:13	Espyo	I have 4k and never went past 9 quint
2014-01-30 02:58:13	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2014-01-30 02:58:32	@PikFan	do you have exactly 4k
2014-01-30 02:58:32	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2014-01-30 02:58:49	Espyo	I have 9,241,189,858,263,495,000 all time now, but I already got a few quads in this session
2014-01-30 02:58:58	Espyo	I have 4222
2014-01-30 02:59:43	@PikFan	4,222(4,222 + 1) / 2 = 8,914,753
2014-01-30 03:00:00	Espyo	uh, you're using that equation all wrong, you know
2014-01-30 03:00:11	Espyo	that's how many cookies you need to get the /next/ HC
2014-01-30 03:00:21	Espyo	and you're meant to input the entire number, not just the number of quads
2014-01-30 03:00:35	@PikFan	no
2014-01-30 03:00:38	Espyo	wait
2014-01-30 03:00:40	Espyo	oh, it's the other one
2014-01-30 03:00:40	Espyo	right
2014-01-30 03:01:04	@PikFan	I'm using the M(M + 1) / 2 formula
2014-01-30 03:01:13	Espyo	right...
2014-01-30 03:01:42	@PikFan	so yeah, the game is right
2014-01-30 03:01:56	@PikFan	you're just tired is all
2014-01-30 03:02:07	Espyo	doesn't stop it from sounding sketchy
2014-01-30 03:02:19	Espyo	again, 4k HCs without reaching 9 quint...
2014-01-30 03:02:19	Testyo	4 K = -269.15 °C / -452.47 °F
2014-01-30 03:02:28	Espyo	doesn't matter, I'll get going now either way
2014-01-30 03:02:29	Espyo	night
2014-01-30 03:02:32	@PikFan	night

2014-01-30 21:21:55	PikFan	hmm
2014-01-30 21:22:06	PikFan	maybe he's hiding
2014-01-30 21:24:20	PikFan	oh, in CC
2014-01-30 21:24:33	PikFan	I'm less than 100 quad from getting 4.51 quint
2014-01-30 21:25:21	PikFan	but I can't get to it now; school
2014-01-30 21:25:41	Espyo	nice
2014-01-30 21:26:06	Espyo	anyway, right now, I'm revamping {{treasures}}
2014-01-30 21:26:12	Espyo	make it look like the Treasure Hoard screen

2014-01-31 20:36:15	Testyo	Hey J, there's a memo for you from Espyo, written on 29/01/2014 00:11 (GMT), saying: it is a regional difference! the Decorative Goo doesn't float in the PAL version.
2014-01-31 20:36:15	Testyo	Hey J, you have a memo from Espyo, written on 29/01/2014 02:08 (GMT), saying: are the Nouveau Table's Sales Pitch notes meant to have an extra line break?.
2014-01-31 20:37:29	@J	crazy
2014-01-31 20:37:32	@J	they shouldn't
2014-01-31 20:37:44	@J	I fixed it

2014-01-31 21:12:07	Espyo	 77777
2014-01-31 21:12:15	Espyo	great, my cat typed that ^ while I was dining
2014-01-31 21:12:23	Espyo	but not before making me quit twice
2014-01-31 21:12:44	Espyo	anyway, now that you're alive, I need your input on the fruit icons https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikmin%203%20fruits.zip
2014-01-31 21:16:57	@J	hmm, I thought you said you did it by deleting the background by colour
2014-01-31 21:17:10	@J	in which case, what caused the polygonal look on some of them?
2014-01-31 21:17:23	Espyo	no, this is GIMP this time
2014-01-31 21:17:30	Espyo	using the path tool and whatnot
2014-01-31 21:17:31	@J	oh, you redid them all?
2014-01-31 21:17:32	@J	hmm
2014-01-31 21:17:35	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-31 21:17:39	@J	you know you can curve paths, right?
2014-01-31 21:17:46	Espyo	that's the worst part — I did
2014-01-31 21:17:51	@J	well, I guess I do see curved edges
2014-01-31 21:17:52	@J	yeah
2014-01-31 21:17:53	@J	hmm
2014-01-31 21:17:57	Espyo	I even made them smooth with shift
2014-01-31 21:17:59	Espyo	and I curved all of them
2014-01-31 21:18:06	Espyo	but even still there's a lot of rigid edges
2014-01-31 21:18:13	Espyo	otoh they're a bit invisible
2014-01-31 21:18:15	@J	well, they probably are curved, but the joints don't match up, maybe
2014-01-31 21:18:18	Espyo	you have to actively look closely
2014-01-31 21:18:26	@J	can you send me an XCF with a path on it?
2014-01-31 21:18:38	Espyo	you mean make a new one?
2014-01-31 21:18:45	Espyo	'cause I didn't save the XCFs
2014-01-31 21:18:50	Espyo	I just did each and closed
2014-01-31 21:19:09	@J	well, just do a quick example of how you'd do it
2014-01-31 21:19:13	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-31 21:26:33	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/SB.xcf ok, this is pretty much a normal path
2014-01-31 21:29:38	@J	hmm, didn't know selections were preserved in XCFs
2014-01-31 21:30:26	@J	yeah, okay, I see
2014-01-31 21:30:37	@J	you just need more practice, I guess
2014-01-31 21:30:54	@J	it's hard to tell how it'll turn out when you're editing on a small scale
2014-01-31 21:31:53	@J	hmm, they don't look that bad, though
2014-01-31 21:32:14	@J	you'll probably get more smoothness if you move the little square things further from the round points
2014-01-31 21:32:31	Espyo	right
2014-01-31 21:32:54	Espyo	but then again, I didn't smooth it as much as I could because it's hardly noticeable
2014-01-31 21:32:59	@J	and don't be afraid to make more waypoints, and move them further out because you can always shrink and/or feather afterwards
2014-01-31 21:33:16	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-31 21:34:01	@J	you have some parts where the edge is very straight, so much that it looks like you overcropped
2014-01-31 21:34:16	@J	like the bottom of Citrus Lump
2014-01-31 21:34:35	@J	is the top of the stalk of Tremendous Sniffer chopped off?
2014-01-31 21:34:44	Espyo	I see what you mean
2014-01-31 21:34:53	@J	RHS of Zest Bomb is weirdly straight
2014-01-31 21:34:54	Espyo	no
2014-01-31 21:35:03	@J	I don't know how much of this comes from the source
2014-01-31 21:35:04	Espyo	yeah, that too
2014-01-31 21:35:13	Espyo	...source?
2014-01-31 21:35:38	@J	source image
2014-01-31 21:35:45	@J	bottom of Scaly Custard
2014-01-31 21:35:54	@J	and Crunchy Deluge
2014-01-31 21:35:57	Espyo	oh
2014-01-31 21:36:18	@J	well, they're probably mostly good enough
2014-01-31 21:36:51	@J	Pocked Airhead and Dawn Pustules are the worst, I think
2014-01-31 21:36:58	@J	the cherry ended up much better this time
2014-01-31 21:37:44	Espyo	sure did
2014-01-31 21:38:06	Espyo	the Dawn Pustules are the worst one this time around
2014-01-31 21:38:17	Espyo	I guess they'll do for now, anyway
2014-01-31 21:38:29	@J	hmm, looking at the source image, it doesn't help that there's a dark shadow/outline around each of them
2014-01-31 21:38:36	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-31 21:38:44	Espyo	but that's just it, it's kind of an outline, but also... not
2014-01-31 21:39:03	Espyo	Scaly Custard, for one
2014-01-31 21:39:20	Espyo	and even the Sunseed Berry doesn't look like it has much of an outline
2014-01-31 21:39:32	Espyo	...the original Sunseed Berry looks a bit polygonal as well
2014-01-31 21:40:16	@J	and you did a pretty good job of removing the numbers
2014-01-31 21:40:27	@J	you can't tell they were there unless you know where to look
2014-01-31 21:40:55	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-31 21:40:59	Espyo	the uh...
2014-01-31 21:41:08	Espyo	Wayward Moon
2014-01-31 21:41:10	@J	...just opened a local image in FF then saved it
2014-01-31 21:41:22	Espyo	was a bit hard to smudge, because of the texture
2014-01-31 21:41:32	Espyo	but then I realized using the clone tool was perfect
2014-01-31 21:41:34	Espyo	also pfft
2014-01-31 21:42:20	@J	I don't know how you did it, but in future, it might help to add a background the opposite colour of the real background
2014-01-31 21:42:27	@J	helps see clearly when you miss some
2014-01-31 21:42:39	@J	I mean, as another layer that you remove when you're done
2014-01-31 21:42:56	Espyo	for every one, I copied it to another image that had some solid layers behind
2014-01-31 21:43:04	Espyo	to see how it fared against white, green and yellow
2014-01-31 21:43:15	Espyo	...somehow I didn't think of the actual opposite color, though
2014-01-31 21:46:05	Espyo	anyway, I can get started on the Fruit navbox soon
2014-01-31 21:46:23	Espyo	and speaking of navboxes, yesterday I tried an alternate navbox for the horrible Treasure Hoard one
2014-01-31 21:46:48	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Pikmin%202%20ISO%20map.txt
2014-01-31 21:47:12	Espyo	replace http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:Treasures&action=edit with that and preview it
2014-01-31 21:47:22	Espyo	there are good things and bad things, so I need opinions
2014-01-31 22:01:34	@J	what?
2014-01-31 22:01:53	Espyo	...that would be the ISO map
2014-01-31 22:01:55	Espyo	i.e. wrong file
2014-01-31 22:02:00	@J	I see
2014-01-31 22:02:03	Espyo	save that if you want, though
2014-01-31 22:02:06	Espyo	it's useful
2014-01-31 22:02:24	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/treasures.txt here we go
2014-01-31 22:02:26	@J	is it a permanent URL?
2014-01-31 22:02:30	Espyo	it's not
2014-01-31 22:02:35	Espyo	when I delete the file, it's gone
2014-01-31 22:02:44	Espyo	(Dropbox)
2014-01-31 22:02:52	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/Pikmin%202%20ISO%20map.txt
2014-01-31 22:02:55	@J	okay, that should stay around
2014-01-31 22:03:00	Espyo	there we go
2014-01-31 22:03:14	Espyo	I made that some minutes ago, so it's not all that complete
2014-01-31 22:03:21	Espyo	I mean, it's not the result of weeks of work
2014-01-31 22:03:27	Espyo	but it has mostly everything necessary
2014-01-31 22:03:34	Espyo	like if you want to know where X is in the disc
2014-01-31 22:03:49	Espyo	Notepad++ is a bit stupid with tabs, so there's a mix of spaces, tabs, and tabs and spaces
2014-01-31 22:03:50	@J	hmm, I'm not sure I like the change in colour scheme
2014-01-31 22:04:01	Espyo	it was made to fit the Treasure Hoard's screen more
2014-01-31 22:04:03	@J	the links become not-super-easy to read
2014-01-31 22:04:11	Espyo	noticed that as well
2014-01-31 22:04:16	Espyo	we could always color the links, but...
2014-01-31 22:04:34	@J	maybe it's my colour-blindness that makes it harder than it is for you, if you think they're really clear
2014-01-31 22:04:37	Espyo	it's not possible to have CSS rules inline, is it?
2014-01-31 22:04:42	Espyo	they're not that clear, no
2014-01-31 22:05:12	@J	have the icons always had aliased outlines?
2014-01-31 22:05:18	Espyo	mhm, always
2014-01-31 22:05:28	@J	hmm
2014-01-31 22:05:38	@J	I'm sure the original rip, before you did this one, didn't
2014-01-31 22:05:53	Espyo	you're remembering wrong
2014-01-31 22:05:59	@J	nope
2014-01-31 22:06:01	Espyo	those come straight from the game files
2014-01-31 22:06:06	@J	I know
2014-01-31 22:06:21	@J	that's why I called it a rip
2014-01-31 22:06:22	@J	by you
2014-01-31 22:06:50	Espyo	then what about the "original" rip?
2014-01-31 22:07:53	@J	I don't know, but it had AA
2014-01-31 22:07:59	@J	I'm trying to find it
2014-01-31 22:08:05	Espyo	blasphemy
2014-01-31 22:08:08	@J	wait
2014-01-31 22:08:10	@J	no, I'm crazy
2014-01-31 22:08:15	@J	I was thinking of the enemy ones
2014-01-31 22:08:15	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-31 22:08:21	Espyo	even those are aliased
2014-01-31 22:08:39	@J	I guess I'm still trying to find it, then
2014-01-31 22:09:07	Espyo	oh, no, the enemy ones are smooth
2014-01-31 22:09:20	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Piklopedia_Antenna_Beetle.png
2014-01-31 22:10:57	@J	good good
2014-01-31 22:11:29	@J	anyway, I'm wondering if giving the treasure ones AA is worth doing
2014-01-31 22:11:44	Espyo	eeeeeeeeehhhhhhhh...
2014-01-31 22:11:58	Espyo	I am not comfortable with the idea of using changed graphics when we have the originals available
2014-01-31 22:12:03	@J	I know
2014-01-31 22:12:05	Espyo	plus, AAing such small images mightn't go well
2014-01-31 22:12:11	@J	but I don't care
2014-01-31 22:12:16	@J	it would look so much better
2014-01-31 22:12:25	Espyo	if the AA works right, yeah
2014-01-31 22:12:43	Espyo	I could try one or two
2014-01-31 22:13:59	Espyo	anyway, there are a few problems
2014-01-31 22:14:11	Espyo	for one thing, that list follows the Treasure Hoard list pretty darn nicely
2014-01-31 22:14:14	Espyo	...but it's the US list
2014-01-31 22:14:28	Espyo	I couldn't find a way to incorporate the PAL list along with it
2014-01-31 22:14:40	Espyo	having the text for US and PAL treasures on the right side was easy
2014-01-31 22:14:42	Espyo	but the icons...
2014-01-31 22:14:49	Espyo	plus, it's not just some changed treasures
2014-01-31 22:14:53	Espyo	it's some /shifted/ ones
2014-01-31 22:14:57	@J	http://i.imgur.com/gm8tRIb.png
2014-01-31 22:15:01	@J	a quick test
2014-01-31 22:15:04	Espyo	a third of the way into the list, 60 on US is 61 on PAL, and such
2014-01-31 22:15:05	@J	it's not fully AA
2014-01-31 22:15:13	Espyo	hmm
2014-01-31 22:15:14	@J	but I tried it in the template and I think it looks better
2014-01-31 22:15:16	Espyo	it's somewhat better
2014-01-31 22:15:27	Espyo	though I have to say, aliased does have some charm...
2014-01-31 22:15:45	@J	only when viewed close up
2014-01-31 22:15:59	@J	at 100%, they look bad
2014-01-31 22:16:13	@J	have you considered giving series names a separate column?
2014-01-31 22:16:22	@J	with colspans
2014-01-31 22:16:37	@J	I know they wouldn't match up exactly, but you never have a 50/50 choice
2014-01-31 22:16:50	@J	that is, in each row, one series always has the majority
2014-01-31 22:16:53	Espyo	haven't considered
2014-01-31 22:16:58	@J	I just don't like how messy it makes the text look
2014-01-31 22:17:00	Espyo	oh, with colspans, I actually did
2014-01-31 22:17:03	@J	uneven line lengths
2014-01-31 22:17:14	Espyo	but it was super hard to pull off, maybe even impossible
2014-01-31 22:17:22	@J	could also colour-code the cell backgrounds
2014-01-31 22:17:37	Espyo	hm, right, but the name of the Series should be there
2014-01-31 22:18:44	Espyo	either way, there's the problem of it being tall
2014-01-31 22:18:44	@J	yeah, I know
2014-01-31 22:18:49	@J	isn't that what I said?
2014-01-31 22:18:52	Espyo	which is one of the things we wanted to get rid of as per the ToDo
2014-01-31 22:19:06	Espyo	I thought you meant just color coded by series, no series names
2014-01-31 22:19:32	@J	no
2014-01-31 22:19:52	Espyo	where would the names go?
2014-01-31 22:20:07	@J	I'm a little concerned about the number of images loaded here, but I guess it's at the end of the page so it shouldn't affect it much
2014-01-31 22:20:30	@J	it would be nice if we could easily do that thing where they're all in a single file
2014-01-31 22:20:45	@J	names would just be in a separate column to the treasure names
2014-01-31 22:21:45	Espyo	I am too
2014-01-31 22:21:52	Espyo	but it turns out it opens the page pretty much instantly
2014-01-31 22:22:37	Espyo	anyway, I was thinking
2014-01-31 22:22:52	Espyo	maybe it might be better to make a wide list, instead of tall
2014-01-31 22:23:08	Espyo	and not ordered by any in-game Treasure Hoard, but ordered by the table we have on [[Treasure Hoard]]
2014-01-31 22:23:15	Espyo	it would fix a lot of problems, maybe even the series one
2014-01-31 22:23:26	Espyo	now, we just have to find a way to also have the names somewhere
2014-01-31 22:23:39	Espyo	those are always necessary; sometimes people want to ctrl+f, and if there are only images...
2014-01-31 22:23:48	Espyo	plus, if the connection is slow and the images don't load
2014-01-31 22:33:42	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grapes.xcf
2014-01-31 22:35:37	Espyo	much better
2014-01-31 22:36:56	@J	http://i.imgur.com/zrJvNcp.png http://i.imgur.com/gNGg3ef.png http://i.imgur.com/QTUuPmx.png
2014-01-31 22:37:33	Espyo	probably #1
2014-01-31 22:37:46	@J	hmm, I think they came out of order
2014-01-31 22:37:53	@J	let me do it with names
2014-01-31 22:38:39	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grapes0.png http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grapes1.png http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/grapes2.png
2014-01-31 22:38:55	@J	the number is the amount of feathering
2014-01-31 22:39:02	Espyo	oh
2014-01-31 22:39:06	@J	though 0 ad 1 hardly seem to differ
2014-01-31 22:39:09	Espyo	...I only noticed a difference in resolution
2014-01-31 22:39:40	Espyo	right, I see now
2014-01-31 22:39:40	@J	because the feathering adds more data further out
2014-01-31 22:39:47	Espyo	grapes2 is a no
2014-01-31 22:39:54	Espyo	mhm, I figured
2014-01-31 22:40:15	@J	2 actually looks quite nice, IMO, but probably loses the intended style
2014-01-31 22:40:26	@J	but yeah, take whichever you want
2014-01-31 22:40:27	Espyo	mhm
2014-01-31 22:40:38	Espyo	now we just need this change for all 30 of them...
2014-01-31 22:40:46	@J	well, that was the worst one
2014-01-31 22:40:52	Espyo	hm, right
2014-01-31 22:41:12	@J	I still don't think it's great - the shape is hard, and the dark outline shows up against the light grapes
2014-01-31 22:44:35	@J	http://i.imgur.com/imV3X66.png
2014-01-31 22:44:51	@J	I can't be bothered to work out why the colspan won't work, but this is what I mean
2014-01-31 22:44:51	@J	t
2014-01-31 22:45:11	@J	except with series centred vertically, with alternating sensible BG colours
2014-01-31 22:45:44	@J	it might be sensible to draw a line across the centre column for each row, to make it easier to line it up with your eye
2014-01-31 22:45:49	@J	see how it looks
2014-01-31 22:46:36	Espyo	hm
2014-01-31 22:46:42	Espyo	also that's because you want rowspan
2014-01-31 22:49:12	@J	oh...yeah
2014-01-31 22:49:21	@J	*still a bit ill*
2014-01-31 22:49:35	Espyo	replace that with *excuses*
2014-01-31 22:50:26	Espyo	anyway, there's still the problem with it being the US list
2014-01-31 22:50:31	Espyo	and tall as hell
2014-01-31 22:52:10	@J	I take it we just listed all the pages on the current version, with treasures in US order and PAL-only ones inserted sensibly-ish?
2014-01-31 22:52:35	Espyo	there is no sensible way to insert them, though...
2014-01-31 22:52:40	Espyo	and it wouldn't be too fair for PAL users
2014-01-31 22:52:46	Espyo	I mean, US gets a nice grid aligned exactly like in-game
2014-01-31 22:52:50	Espyo	PAL gets the scraps, put aside
2014-01-31 22:52:58	@J	not sure tall is a problem
2014-01-31 22:53:02	@J	there's a lot of information in there
2014-01-31 22:53:09	Espyo	gotta agree, I don't think it is
2014-01-31 22:53:17	Espyo	but if we could make it wider and less taller, all the better
2014-01-31 22:53:27	Espyo	one things for sure, the current template is horrible
2014-01-31 22:53:34	Espyo	no icons, gigantic, and wastes a lot of space
2014-01-31 22:53:37	@J	you could make it 2 columns wide, but we have to think of client viewport size
2014-01-31 22:53:45	Espyo	yeah
2014-01-31 22:54:02	Espyo	I actually initially thought of only making the navbox be like 600 pixels tall
2014-01-31 22:54:05	Espyo	and then we have a scrollbar
2014-01-31 22:54:12	Espyo	also a bit like it is in the in-game Treasure Hoard
2014-01-31 22:54:17	@J	I did consider it, but it won't help anything
2014-01-31 22:54:19	Espyo	but I couldn't quite find a way to do it
2014-01-31 22:54:31	Espyo	why not?
2014-01-31 22:54:44	@J	you could probably do it by writing the table in HTML, and give the tbody an overflow:
2014-01-31 22:54:57	Espyo	what about a max-height property?
2014-01-31 22:55:05	@J	yeah, and height, of course
2014-01-31 22:55:13	@J	but it's the overflow that gives it the scrollbar
2014-01-31 22:55:14	Espyo	but wouldn't max-height be enough?
2014-01-31 22:55:18	@J	hmm, not sure
2014-01-31 22:55:24	@J	not sure what default overflow is
2014-01-31 22:55:25	Espyo	hm, if overflow is a CSS rule, it should work
2014-01-31 22:55:32	@J	it is
2014-01-31 22:55:34	Espyo	I think it might just be scrollbar
2014-01-31 22:56:06	@J	overflow default is 'visible'
2014-01-31 22:56:15	Espyo	drat
2014-01-31 22:56:19	@J	which means show everything
2014-01-31 22:56:25	@J	so you do overflow: scroll
2014-01-31 22:57:16	Espyo	...also I forgot to tell you to ignore the text at the top
2014-01-31 22:57:21	Espyo	(of the text file)
2014-01-31 22:57:30	Espyo	while looking through MediaWiki's help, I saw that property
2014-01-31 22:57:36	Espyo	figured that the thing I wrote would work
2014-01-31 22:57:38	Espyo	but never testes
2014-01-31 22:57:39	Espyo	*tesed
2014-01-31 22:57:42	Espyo	...*tested
2014-01-31 22:57:50	Espyo	so I just wrote it there so I don't forget
2014-01-31 22:58:00	@J	max-height on table apparently isn't widely supported
2014-01-31 22:58:52	@J	that is, it's optional in the spec, so they don't implement it
2014-01-31 22:59:08	@J	which kind of makes sense
2014-01-31 22:59:54	Espyo	gleh, height doesn't work either
2014-01-31 23:00:54	Espyo	height is completely ignored on tables
2014-01-31 23:02:12	@J	I don't think height is
2014-01-31 23:02:21	@J	but it's a target, and it probably has a minimum
2014-01-31 23:02:28	Espyo	hm?
2014-01-31 23:02:29	@J	height: 10000px might do things
2014-01-31 23:02:48	@J	but yeah, just do 'height: 400px; overflow: scroll' or something
2014-01-31 23:02:54	Espyo	tried
2014-01-31 23:02:56	Espyo	didn't do a thing
2014-01-31 23:03:01	@J	hmm
2014-01-31 23:03:22	Espyo	it's not compressing the table, much less making it scroll
2014-01-31 23:03:45	@J	it can be done using 'display: block'
2014-01-31 23:03:53	Espyo	I /just/ read that
2014-01-31 23:03:54	@J	but if there's another way, that would be better
2014-01-31 23:03:59	Espyo	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8970362/setting-a-max-height-on-a-table
2014-01-31 23:05:03	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/treasures.txt
2014-01-31 23:05:09	@J	anyway, like I said, probably do it on tbody rather than the whole table
2014-01-31 23:05:34	@J	oh, you did
2014-01-31 23:05:36	Espyo	we can't edit tbody directly, unless we create a table using HTML
2014-01-31 23:05:49	@J	wait, no, you...
2014-01-31 23:05:52	@J	put a table in the table
2014-01-31 23:05:55	@J	*cringes*
2014-01-31 23:06:02	Espyo	because of the header
2014-01-31 23:06:07	@J	I know
2014-01-31 23:06:08	Espyo	there's nothing wrong with meta-tables
2014-01-31 23:06:12	@J	there kind of it
2014-01-31 23:06:13	@J	is
2014-01-31 23:06:16	Espyo	they are HTML too
2014-01-31 23:06:26	Espyo	nonsense
2014-01-31 23:06:51	Espyo	our cave technical description template uses meta-tables
2014-01-31 23:06:57	Espyo	besides, our inner table here isn't a table!
2014-01-31 23:06:58	Espyo	it's a block
2014-01-31 23:07:08	Espyo	it's not display:table any more
2014-01-31 23:07:19	@J	it's still a table
2014-01-31 23:07:25	@J	display is only for CSS
2014-01-31 23:07:31	Espyo	I know
2014-01-31 23:07:36	Espyo	but that table doesn't feel like a table
2014-01-31 23:07:38	@J	content-wise it's a table
2014-01-31 23:07:51	Espyo	either way, it's either using HTML when we have wiki-syntax
2014-01-31 23:07:53	@J	anyway, sure
2014-01-31 23:07:53	Espyo	or use nested tables
2014-01-31 23:07:58	Espyo	and there's no problem with the latter, so...
2014-01-31 23:08:05	@J	but I'm not going to like it
2014-01-31 23:08:27	Espyo	but you have to explain why
2014-01-31 23:10:06	@J	no I don't
2014-01-31 23:10:17	Espyo	pretty sure you do under internet law
2014-01-31 23:25:23	@J	no I don't

2014-02-01 18:04:32	Pikpikmate	Hai
2014-02-01 18:05:50	Espyo	hey
2014-02-01 19:43:36	Pikpikmate	Man, that's a lot of added icons
2014-02-01 19:45:40	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-01 19:45:44	Espyo	took a bit
2014-02-01 19:48:51	Pikpikmate	Well, good job
2014-02-01 19:53:52	@J	.
2014-02-01 19:54:09	@J	so I'm becoming impressed at how resilient this computer is
2014-02-01 19:54:33	@J	this time, while I was doing stuff, it remounted all the partitions read-only for some reason
2014-02-01 19:54:37	Espyo	thanks
2014-02-01 19:54:40	Espyo	hey
2014-02-01 19:54:46	@J	I rebooted and the root partition couldn't be mounted
2014-02-01 19:54:54	Espyo	...sounds scarier than it should be
2014-02-01 19:55:02	@J	rebooted into a live thingy and I couldn't run a filesystem check on it
2014-02-01 19:55:38	@J	so I used a tool to copy the whole partition to another disk, with retries for bits that didn't get read properly the first time
2014-02-01 19:55:42	@J	then copied it back
2014-02-01 19:55:49	@J	ran a filesystem check
2014-02-01 19:55:52	@J	and everything works
2014-02-01 19:56:25	@J	...and I ordered a new hard drive, because this is becoming ominously frequent
2014-02-01 19:58:16	Espyo	sure is
2014-02-01 20:01:13	@J	I'm also fairly impressed that all the running programs at the time, as far as I could tell, handled not being able to write to disk any more without much trouble
2014-02-01 20:01:24	@J	by which I guess I mean I didn't see anything crash
2014-02-01 20:01:46	@J	and I saw lots of warning messages saying the same thing all over the place
2014-02-01 20:05:56	Espyo	that is pretty surprising
2014-02-01 20:06:07	Espyo	I don't think the likes of Testyo would crash, but...
2014-02-01 20:06:58	@J	you say that
2014-02-01 20:07:40	Espyo	oh no
2014-02-01 20:07:51	Espyo	what you're thinking about making happen is not going to happen
2014-02-01 20:17:57	@J	I wasn't thinking anything
2014-02-01 20:18:06	@J	nothing at all
2014-02-01 20:18:26	Espyo	you certainly weren't thinking about ____
2014-02-01 20:38:36	@J	http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5362156/windows-8-1-update-1-boot-to-desktop-by-default
2014-02-01 20:39:12	Espyo	yeah, I updated my new laptop's W8 to 8.1
2014-02-01 20:39:36	Espyo	still a four quadrillion on the horrible scale
2014-02-01 20:39:51	Espyo	but at least it's not a four point two quadrillion
2014-02-01 20:40:21	@J	oh, you have your laptop now?
2014-02-01 20:40:35	@J	I thought I would notice when you started ranting
2014-02-01 20:40:45	@J	but you seem to be holding it back quite well
2014-02-01 20:41:09	Espyo	...March?
2014-02-01 20:41:20	Espyo	if it's only being release March, then what was that update...?
2014-02-01 20:41:26	Espyo	I don't use it yet
2014-02-01 20:41:30	Espyo	we bought it, but I'm not using it yet
2014-02-01 20:41:33	Espyo	first my fianls
2014-02-01 20:41:36	Espyo	*finals
2014-02-01 20:41:43	Espyo	then I can worry about horrible "operative systems"
2014-02-01 20:42:18	Espyo	there's a pretty funny thing about the update
2014-02-01 20:42:20	Espyo	by funny I mean sad
2014-02-01 20:42:37	Espyo	to update, you must go to the microsoft store, which is several kinds of messed up, but whatever
2014-02-01 20:42:51	Espyo	before you begin, it warns you that there will be a prompt asking if you accept the terms and conditions
2014-02-01 20:43:01	Espyo	and if you decline, it'll revert back to windows 8
2014-02-01 20:43:08	Espyo	all fine and dandy, except for one tiny thing...
2014-02-01 20:43:25	Espyo	wouldn't it be several times better to ask me if I accept AT THE START of the installation?
2014-02-01 20:43:35	Espyo	it's
2014-02-01 20:43:52	Espyo	not even a newbie designer would do that
2014-02-01 20:44:04	@J	there was an update to add an option to do the thing
2014-02-01 20:44:13	Espyo	and supposedly microsoft is a "great" company, so...
2014-02-01 20:44:16	@J	but the one to make it default isn't out yet
2014-02-01 20:44:22	Espyo	oh, I see
2014-02-01 20:45:08	Espyo	just skimmed the article tbh, because I assumed it was the version I had

2014-02-02 16:21:06	@J	whaaaa
2014-02-02 16:21:17	@J	why does this FTP client have a builtin bittorrent client?
2014-02-02 16:21:27	Espyo	because why not
2014-02-02 16:23:24	@J	so in the middle of doing some FTP stuff you want to download some torrents?
2014-02-02 16:23:36	@J	completely unrelated to the remote?
2014-02-02 16:23:40	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 16:23:47	Espyo	it's an all-in-oner
2014-02-02 17:46:00	Espyo	guh, there was this program
2014-02-02 17:46:08	Espyo	where you could write your own questions and answers about a subject
2014-02-02 17:46:19	Espyo	and then you'd have to answer them, and the ones you got wrong appeared again later
2014-02-02 17:46:25	Espyo	to help you memorize stuff for a test
2014-02-02 17:46:29	Espyo	I can't find it now
2014-02-02 18:09:15	@J	Anki?
2014-02-02 18:10:11	Espyo	I was gonna say it sounded like Ankh or some such
2014-02-02 18:10:15	Espyo	but yeah, that's precisely it, thanks
2014-02-02 18:10:25	Espyo	I tried searching on sourceforge some more and found a different one
2014-02-02 18:10:28	Espyo	I'll check both
2014-02-02 18:43:52	@J	lemontime
2014-02-02 18:43:56	@J	...again
2014-02-02 18:44:09	@J	the window wasn't even visible this time
2014-02-02 18:44:22	Espyo	I have a lot of questio—
2014-02-02 18:44:23	Espyo	oh, right
2014-02-02 18:45:57	@J	...just pressed a keyboard shortcut that kills everything and logs you out
2014-02-02 18:46:03	Espyo	heh
2014-02-02 18:46:13	@J	though I just realised you wouldn't've noticed anything because this is running on a different computer

2014-02-02 19:46:55	@PikFan	so I saw you added the treasure icons to the treasure pages
2014-02-02 19:47:05	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 19:47:13	Espyo	gotta do the same for Piklopedia icons soon
2014-02-02 19:47:18	@PikFan	I was wondering if you could — yeah
2014-02-02 19:47:27	@PikFan	was about to say that
2014-02-02 19:47:36	Espyo	I was almost gonna forget, actually

2014-02-02 19:49:37	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-02 19:49:43	Espyo	they could be better, but they're good enough
2014-02-02 19:49:45	@PikFan	what did he say?
2014-02-02 19:49:48	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-02 19:50:16	@PikFan	...oh, you still need me to give you names

2014-02-02 20:09:52	@PikFan	couldn't you just downsize it?
2014-02-02 20:10:44	Espyo	guess I have to
2014-02-02 20:10:57	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-02 20:11:02	@PikFan	what about the bosses?
2014-02-02 20:12:47	Espyo	they're that size
2014-02-02 20:12:48	Espyo	 80x80
2014-02-02 20:13:01	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2014-02-02 20:13:15	@PikFan	but are you going to leave them at 80x80?
2014-02-02 20:13:20	Espyo	of course!
2014-02-02 20:13:26	Espyo	I'm not changing the original graphics!
2014-02-02 20:13:34	Espyo	I'll just tell the table to render them smaller, is all
2014-02-02 20:13:47	@PikFan	oh, Espyo

2014-02-02 20:14:50	Espyo	:|
2014-02-02 20:14:59	Espyo	you're the one with the crazy suggestion
2014-02-02 20:15:28	@PikFan	...to downsize the Fiery Bulblax?
2014-02-02 20:15:34	Espyo	J: your Firefox wouldn't happen to allow rectangle selections, would it
2014-02-02 20:15:36	Espyo	yeah, that
2014-02-02 20:15:56	Espyo	the graphics are to be on the wiki exactly as they're ripped from the game
2014-02-02 20:16:03	Espyo	cropping would be fine, as long as no info is lost
2014-02-02 20:16:07	Espyo	but resizing loses info
2014-02-02 20:16:09	Espyo	so no way
2014-02-02 20:16:22	@PikFan	you have a point
2014-02-02 20:16:25	@PikFan	also
2014-02-02 20:16:33	@PikFan	in Cookie Clicker
2014-02-02 20:16:57	@PikFan	I got the three Grandmapocalypse-related achievements, and enough cookies for 3k HCs

2014-02-02 20:17:33	Espyo	nice

2014-02-02 20:18:02	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 20:18:15	@PikFan	probably get to a trillion cps this session
2014-02-02 20:19:11	Espyo	definitely
2014-02-02 20:22:12	@J	[20:15:34] Espyo J: your Firefox wouldn't happen to allow rectangle selections, would it
2014-02-02 20:22:17	@J	what do you mean?
2014-02-02 20:22:56	@J	hmm, I kind of like the huge icon
2014-02-02 20:23:11	@J	but why is it in both trivia and on the infobox?
2014-02-02 20:23:21	Espyo	oh, it can be removed from the infobox now
2014-02-02 20:23:25	Espyo	*from the trivia now
2014-02-02 20:23:41	Espyo	the icon is not the problem, the overstretched header is
2014-02-02 20:23:58	Espyo	anyway, if you grab your nearest good text editor, you can probably hold Alt and use the mouse to select in a rectangle
2014-02-02 20:24:11	Espyo	Notepad++ and shockingly enough VS have this feature
2014-02-02 20:24:13	Espyo	but FF doesn't
2014-02-02 20:27:43	@J	oh, you mean on text
2014-02-02 20:27:54	@J	mm, doesn't really make sense for it to be able to, does it?
2014-02-02 20:28:03	@J	I can understand for editing code, but...
2014-02-02 20:28:14	Espyo	it helps a lot in some places
2014-02-02 20:28:14	@J	oh, wait, you mean in a text box, rather than just text?
2014-02-02 20:28:18	Espyo	text box
2014-02-02 20:28:21	@J	mm
2014-02-02 20:28:30	@J	well, I guess I can see it being useful
2014-02-02 20:28:37	Espyo	a textarea, rather
2014-02-02 20:28:43	Espyo	I use it daily
2014-02-02 20:28:46	@J	not much unless you can easily edit such a selection, though
2014-02-02 20:28:57	Espyo	well yeah
2014-02-02 20:29:03	Espyo	they're normally editable
2014-02-02 20:29:26	@J	but how?
2014-02-02 20:29:29	Espyo	I can always c+p the infobox text (I want to select a rectangle so I can pad all lines at once right) into N++
2014-02-02 20:29:45	Espyo	but then I'd lose the "|icon        = Piklopedia .png" in my clipboard...
2014-02-02 20:29:51	Espyo	ok, let me shoot you an example
2014-02-02 20:33:39	Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/rect%20sel%20example.gif
2014-02-02 20:34:40	@J	okay, so what you really mean is multiple cursors
2014-02-02 20:34:41	Espyo	at least that's the use I'd give it now
2014-02-02 20:34:48	Espyo	eeeeeehhhh...
2014-02-02 20:34:51	Espyo	it's not quite the same
2014-02-02 20:35:03	Espyo	but... it is
2014-02-02 20:35:12	@J	block selection without multiple cursors wouldn't help you
2014-02-02 20:35:20	@J	therefore it's the multiple cursors that you want
2014-02-02 20:35:26	Espyo	well, yeah
2014-02-02 20:35:34	Espyo	it's just that N++ has actual multiple cursors, whereas VS doesn't
2014-02-02 20:35:40	Espyo	and they both allow block selection and editing
2014-02-02 20:36:59	@J	can you only use the mouse to make the selection, though?
2014-02-02 20:37:15	Espyo	arrow keys work too
2014-02-02 20:37:24	@J	with alt?
2014-02-02 20:37:34	Espyo	www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Hermit_Crawmad&diff=78294&oldid=73610 mysterious ".jpg" change
2014-02-02 20:37:58	Espyo	when I pasted onto N++, it DID show a question mark (unknown character in ASCII) after the ".jpg"...
2014-02-02 20:38:01	Espyo	yeah, with alt + arrow keys
2014-02-02 20:38:08	Espyo	or alt + mouse selection
2014-02-02 20:38:37	@J	can you put multiple cursors on the same line?
2014-02-02 20:39:50	@J	it's a left-to-right mark
2014-02-02 20:39:52	@J	apparently
2014-02-02 20:39:56	@J	unicode 8206
2014-02-02 20:40:07	Espyo	I can, yeah
2014-02-02 20:40:08	Espyo	oh, I see
2014-02-02 20:40:13	Espyo	wonder how that got in there
2014-02-02 21:06:56	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2014-02-02 21:07:22	@PikFan	I've been wondering about this for a while now
2014-02-02 21:07:51	@PikFan	in Pikmin 3, you can have the maximum amount of Pikmin carrying an object
2014-02-02 21:07:53	@PikFan	BUT
2014-02-02 21:08:08	@PikFan	when you add Winged Pikmin, it actually goes over that "limit"
2014-02-02 21:08:24	@PikFan	so like
2014-02-02 21:08:40	@PikFan	you could have 6 ground Pikmin carrying a dwarf bulborb
2014-02-02 21:08:57	@PikFan	but you could add 2 Wingeds, and it goes up to 8
2014-02-02 21:10:31	@PikFan	if you add a third Winged Pikmin, they take the dwarf bulborb into the air, and the number of carriers drops to 3
2014-02-02 21:12:06	@PikFan	so for heavier objects, like... say, the Crunchy Deluge
2014-02-02 21:12:37	@PikFan	20 ground Pikmin are carrying it
2014-02-02 21:12:46	@PikFan	add 9 Wingeds; the total is 29
2014-02-02 21:21:06	Espyo	hmm...
2014-02-02 21:21:28	Espyo	so the total Pikmin that can carry an object is <total> grounded Pikmin + <total - 1> Winged
2014-02-02 21:21:46	Espyo	once <total> Winged start carrying, the object goes airborne and the rest let go
2014-02-02 21:21:46	@PikFan	apparently
2014-02-02 21:21:57	Espyo	try it with something that has like the total be 50
2014-02-02 21:24:08	@PikFan	wait, what do you mean
2014-02-02 21:25:05	Espyo	try it with 50 grounded + 49 Winged
2014-02-02 21:25:07	@PikFan	afaik the heaviest objects in the game require 20 Pikmin to carry them
2014-02-02 21:25:09	Espyo	for a real grabfest
2014-02-02 21:25:14	Espyo	yawwwwwn
2014-02-02 21:25:21	Espyo	ok, 20 + 19 then
2014-02-02 21:25:27	@PikFan	well...
2014-02-02 21:25:32	@PikFan	their maxes are 30
2014-02-02 21:25:44	@PikFan	oh, I know
2014-02-02 21:25:52	Espyo	err, 30 + 29, right
2014-02-02 21:25:54	@PikFan	Wayward Moon
2014-02-02 21:25:56	Espyo	hm
2014-02-02 21:26:01	Espyo	no enemy corpse that's humongous?
2014-02-02 21:26:02	@PikFan	30 max
2014-02-02 21:26:10	@PikFan	well, there's boss corpses
2014-02-02 21:26:20	@PikFan	but even those need just 20
2014-02-02 21:26:24	Espyo	hm
2014-02-02 21:26:37	Espyo	oh, do bosses have a kickass theme?
2014-02-02 21:26:42	Espyo	that varies and everything?
2014-02-02 21:26:50	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-02-02 21:26:50	Espyo	and does an awesome finale theme when you beat them?
2014-02-02 21:26:57	@PikFan	OH
2014-02-02 21:26:58	@PikFan	yes
2014-02-02 21:27:00	@PikFan	yes, they do
2014-02-02 21:27:03	Espyo	phew
2014-02-02 21:27:10	@PikFan	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T35djY8HnIU
2014-02-02 21:27:12	Espyo	starting to get worried, considering all the thing that were toned down
2014-02-02 21:27:23	Espyo	uh, I'll enjoy it head-first when I play the game
2014-02-02 21:27:32	@PikFan	heh, okay
2014-02-02 21:33:48	@PikFan	almost
2014-02-02 21:34:41	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-02 21:35:06	@PikFan	so, the Wayward Moon needs 20 to carry, 30 ground max
2014-02-02 21:35:15	@PikFan	the combined max is 49
2014-02-02 21:35:37	Espyo	shouldn't it be 59?
2014-02-02 21:35:42	Espyo	oh, right
2014-02-02 21:35:43	Espyo	never mind
2014-02-02 21:35:47	@PikFan	once I added the twentieth Winged Pikmin, they became airborne
2014-02-02 21:35:50	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 21:36:03	Espyo	so <ground max> + <needed - 1>
2014-02-02 21:36:16	Espyo	<ground max> + (<needed> - 1)
2014-02-02 21:36:18	Espyo	more accurate
2014-02-02 21:36:27	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 21:36:37	Espyo	<ground max> grounded + (<needed> - 1) Winged
2014-02-02 21:36:37	@PikFan	you should mention this in Carrying
2014-02-02 21:36:41	Espyo	even more accurate
2014-02-02 21:36:50	Espyo	yeah, but maybe you should run some more minor tests, just to be sure
2014-02-02 21:36:57	Espyo	try tiny things, huge things, normal things
2014-02-02 21:37:07	Espyo	oddly shaped things, enemy carcasses, pellets, fruits, captains
2014-02-02 21:37:07	@PikFan	yeah, I'll try it with some weird ones
2014-02-02 21:37:31	Espyo	weren't those 49 Pikmin all cramped carrying the WM together?
2014-02-02 21:37:33	@PikFan	like the Scaly Custard, which is 8 needed, 16 grounded max
2014-02-02 21:37:42	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-02 21:37:55	@PikFan	you see, the Winged Pikmin carry the WM from the top
2014-02-02 21:37:59	Espyo	ah
2014-02-02 21:38:03	Espyo	fair enough
2014-02-02 21:38:08	Espyo	other things as well, I imagine?
2014-02-02 21:38:13	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 21:38:29	Espyo	hmm
2014-02-02 21:38:50	Espyo	the highest number that could be displayed would probably be 319
2014-02-02 21:39:01	Espyo	 2-P mode, or some Mission Mode stage with Purples
2014-02-02 21:39:27	@PikFan	...there is a Mission Mode stage where that's possible
2014-02-02 21:39:36	@PikFan	Thirsty Desert Remix
2014-02-02 21:39:54	@PikFan	35 Purples, 3 Pink Candypops
2014-02-02 21:40:03	@PikFan	a lot of heavy fruits
2014-02-02 21:40:31	Espyo	any non-purples, though?
2014-02-02 21:40:35	@PikFan	nope
2014-02-02 21:40:42	Espyo	then it's not possible
2014-02-02 21:40:49	@PikFan	?
2014-02-02 21:40:50	Espyo	you'd have to give up 19 Purples
2014-02-02 21:40:58	Espyo	leaving you with 16 Purples
2014-02-02 21:41:03	Espyo	so 179
2014-02-02 21:41:39	Espyo	 300 would be the max then, with 30 Purples carrying it
2014-02-02 21:41:45	Espyo	I don't suppose... nah
2014-02-02 21:41:51	@PikFan	heh
2014-02-02 21:41:55	Espyo	I don't suppose the number is an unsigned byte...
2014-02-02 21:41:59	Espyo	if it is, it's limited to 255 max
2014-02-02 21:42:02	Espyo	nah, that's impossibel
2014-02-02 21:42:04	Espyo	*impossible
2014-02-02 21:42:08	@PikFan	anyway
2014-02-02 21:42:09	Espyo	they would never let that happen
2014-02-02 21:42:17	@PikFan	so I tested the Scaly Custard
2014-02-02 21:42:39	@PikFan	16 grounded Pikmin + 7 Winged Pikmin
2014-02-02 21:42:49	@PikFan	added the eighth Winged, became airborne
2014-02-02 21:43:23	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 21:46:58	-->	Gamefreak (Fassad@nxg-80-831-876-818.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #pikipedia
2014-02-02 21:50:09	@PikFan	hmm
2014-02-02 21:50:23	@PikFan	I'm going to try it with another weird one
2014-02-02 21:50:43	@PikFan	Calcified Crushblat, 12 needed, 25 ground max
2014-02-02 21:51:03	Espyo	hmmmm
2014-02-02 21:51:03	@PikFan	in theory, the combined max should be 36
2014-02-02 21:51:13	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-02 22:00:58	Espyo	ok, all of them are done
2014-02-02 22:01:01	Espyo	I even double-checked
2014-02-02 22:01:08	Espyo	I also double-checked the Treasure Hoard ones
2014-02-02 22:01:33	Espyo	and I also hid my changes on the recent changes, to see if anybody had made an edit amidst my torrent of edits
2014-02-02 22:01:40	Espyo	(also did it for the Treasure Hoard ones)
2014-02-02 22:01:54	Espyo	(no edits, except for yours on Whiptongue Bulborb, PikFan)
2014-02-02 22:02:03	@PikFan	I see
2014-02-02 22:02:19	Espyo	how's the Calcified Crushblat test going?
2014-02-02 22:02:27	@PikFan	it didn't work
2014-02-02 22:02:43	@PikFan	because there was water, and it was too deep for the Wingeds to carry
2014-02-02 22:02:58	Espyo	oh
2014-02-02 22:03:02	Espyo	couldn't you fish it out...?
2014-02-02 22:03:11	@PikFan	so I'm going to try the Spotty Bulbear, which has the same carrying stats
2014-02-02 22:03:52	Espyo	 12-25?
2014-02-02 22:04:29	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:04:30	Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Burrowing_Snagret ok, they don't look bad if they're forced to be 40px
2014-02-02 22:04:34	@PikFan	...wait, oops
2014-02-02 22:04:42	@PikFan	I need to go back in time
2014-02-02 22:04:59	Espyo	can you do that? like in PNPC!?
2014-02-02 22:05:03	Espyo	*NPCP!
2014-02-02 22:05:11	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:05:15	Espyo	ah, nice
2014-02-02 22:05:41	@PikFan	now I'm going to speculate
2014-02-02 22:05:51	@PikFan	they didn't do it in P2 because of cases like me
2014-02-02 22:06:01	@PikFan	i.e. hundreds of days
2014-02-02 22:06:04	Espyo	yeah
2014-02-02 22:06:09	Espyo	though they could've limited to the past 30
2014-02-02 22:06:15	Espyo	isn't that what they do in P3?
2014-02-02 22:06:23	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-02-02 22:06:25	Espyo	or does P3 have a limit of days?
2014-02-02 22:06:31	Espyo	it should have, if fruit isn't infinite
2014-02-02 22:06:35	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:06:40	@PikFan	99 days is the max
2014-02-02 22:06:43	Espyo	:|
2014-02-02 22:06:55	Espyo	hard-coded, or are there 99 juices?
2014-02-02 22:07:07	@PikFan	98 juices
2014-02-02 22:07:21	@PikFan	ugh, I'll let Miles explain
2014-02-02 22:07:23	Espyo	oh, plus the first day free, I imagine
2014-02-02 22:07:30	Espyo	no need, I think I've got it
2014-02-02 22:07:36	@PikFan	oh, okay
2014-02-02 22:11:15	@PikFan	also, my prediction for the Bulbear came true
2014-02-02 22:11:33	@PikFan	36 carriers prior to the 12th Winged
2014-02-02 22:11:37	Espyo	awesome
2014-02-02 22:11:41	Espyo	try something tiny now
2014-02-02 22:12:00	@PikFan	hm
2014-02-02 22:12:28	@PikFan	something that weighs 5?
2014-02-02 22:12:35	Espyo	smaller, if you can
2014-02-02 22:12:54	@PikFan	oh, I know
2014-02-02 22:13:02	@PikFan	Skeeterskates
2014-02-02 22:13:11	@PikFan	2 needed, 4 grounded max
2014-02-02 22:13:43	Espyo	hm
2014-02-02 22:16:08	@PikFan	uuuuuuugh
2014-02-02 22:16:26	@PikFan	Pikmin are terrible at carrying
2014-02-02 22:16:29	Espyo	heh
2014-02-02 22:16:48	@PikFan	they really are
2014-02-02 22:17:16	@PikFan	they have a hard time circling around to get to the other side
2014-02-02 22:17:24	@PikFan	it drives me nuts
2014-02-02 22:17:35	Espyo	shouldn't be too hard to make them do that
2014-02-02 22:19:15	@PikFan	they arrange themselves a bit better when you charge them at the object
2014-02-02 22:20:03	@PikFan	also, for the Skeeterskate
2014-02-02 22:20:18	@PikFan	I added 1 Winged
2014-02-02 22:20:25	@PikFan	then I added the 2nd
2014-02-02 22:20:31	@PikFan	it became airborne
2014-02-02 22:21:16	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 22:21:19	Espyo	that's it
2014-02-02 22:21:25	Espyo	now try a captain, would you?
2014-02-02 22:21:55	@PikFan	...but captains can't lay down
2014-02-02 22:22:03	Espyo	...oh
2014-02-02 22:22:09	Espyo	what about Louie on Clockwork Chasm?
2014-02-02 22:22:10	@PikFan	I still can do it, though
2014-02-02 22:22:18	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:22:30	@PikFan	he's in Story Mode, too
2014-02-02 22:22:35	Espyo	ah
2014-02-02 22:22:44	@PikFan	I'll just go grab him
2014-02-02 22:22:49	@PikFan	let's see
2014-02-02 22:22:59	@PikFan	needed is 5, grounded max is 10
2014-02-02 22:23:10	@PikFan	so it should go up to 14 before they go airborne
2014-02-02 22:23:30	Espyo	wow he's heavy
2014-02-02 22:23:41	@PikFan	yeah, I don't know why they upped it
2014-02-02 22:24:08	Espyo	well, it does serve a different purpose carrying a leader
2014-02-02 22:24:11	Espyo	compared to the previous games
2014-02-02 22:24:18	Espyo	and they are a bit inconsistent as it is
2014-02-02 22:24:24	Espyo	 3 in Pikmin, 1 in Pikmin 2, I believe?
2014-02-02 22:24:51	@PikFan	I'm not sure
2014-02-02 22:24:58	Espyo	also, is there any other sort of object that's carryable in P3 that wasn't or didn't exist in P2?
2014-02-02 22:25:09	Espyo	(carriable, whatever, nothing is a word)
2014-02-02 22:25:32	@PikFan	well... there's the fruits and enemies
2014-02-02 22:25:47	Espyo	hm
2014-02-02 22:25:49	Espyo	nothing else?
2014-02-02 22:25:53	@PikFan	well
2014-02-02 22:26:00	@PikFan	there are upgrades
2014-02-02 22:26:07	Espyo	no special jewel like thing that needs to be carried to a slot to open a magical door or anything?
2014-02-02 22:26:35	@PikFan	there are things that unlock new areas
2014-02-02 22:26:40	@PikFan	like
2014-02-02 22:27:01	@PikFan	the Data Glutton, which is a phone, unlocks the Distant Tundra
2014-02-02 22:27:07	Espyo	hm
2014-02-02 22:27:13	@PikFan	that weighs 10
2014-02-02 22:27:16	Espyo	but they're deep down the same as the Geographic Projection
2014-02-02 22:27:25	Espyo	I mean something that is integrally different from anything before
2014-02-02 22:27:27	@PikFan	anyway, I'm going to do Louie now
2014-02-02 22:27:36	Espyo	so in the end, fruits and the upgrades are still "treasures"
2014-02-02 22:27:41	Espyo	and enemy corpses are still enemy corpses
2014-02-02 22:27:52	@PikFan	oh, I see what you mean
2014-02-02 22:27:59	Espyo	I say this because we have a list of carriyaiyiayiable things in [[Carrying]]
2014-02-02 22:28:09	Espyo	and since I'm gonna edit it, I could as well add Pikmin 3 stuff
2014-02-02 22:28:26	@PikFan	well...
2014-02-02 22:28:38	@PikFan	I think that's it
2014-02-02 22:28:53	@PikFan	wait
2014-02-02 22:28:54	@PikFan	no
2014-02-02 22:29:02	@PikFan	well, I don't know
2014-02-02 22:29:21	@PikFan	there's Ultra Spicy berries
2014-02-02 22:29:28	@PikFan	then there are Fragments
2014-02-02 22:29:37	Espyo	oh yeah, berries aren't on the list, are they?
2014-02-02 22:29:37	@PikFan	and then there are pieces of Hay
2014-02-02 22:29:41	Espyo	bridge fragments, huh?
2014-02-02 22:30:07	@PikFan	all of which the Pikmin, after delivering these things, return to the main pile
2014-02-02 22:30:40	@PikFan	er, "pile"
2014-02-02 22:31:07	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 22:31:14	Espyo	berries in P3 come from BS, yes?
2014-02-02 22:31:28	@PikFan	yes
2014-02-02 22:31:37	Espyo	where are the fragments and hay delivered to?
2014-02-02 22:31:49	Espyo	the fragments are "delivered" to the bridge being built
2014-02-02 22:31:56	Espyo	but what about the hay?
2014-02-02 22:32:10	@PikFan	oh, they're delivered to a place to make a sort of ramp
2014-02-02 22:32:27	Espyo	hmmm...
2014-02-02 22:33:18	Espyo	I'll just say they're used to create bridges
2014-02-02 22:33:24	Espyo	they're bridges, after all
2014-02-02 22:33:53	@PikFan	in one case, though, fragments are used to build a pot
2014-02-02 22:34:01	Espyo	hah
2014-02-02 22:34:09	@PikFan	so that you can throw the leaders across
2014-02-02 22:34:17	Espyo	guess I'll change it to "to create objects" then
2014-02-02 22:34:30	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:34:45	@PikFan	and then there are the Dawn/Dusk Pustules
2014-02-02 22:34:56	@PikFan	they're fruits — bunches of grapes
2014-02-02 22:35:17	@PikFan	which act the same as fragments/berries/hay
2014-02-02 22:35:18	Espyo	but they're fruits in the end, aren't they?
2014-02-02 22:35:22	Espyo	or are they treated differently?
2014-02-02 22:35:34	Espyo	like you only "create" the fruit after all grapes are delivered?
2014-02-02 22:35:39	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:35:48	Espyo	oh, ok
2014-02-02 22:35:51	Espyo	any other fruit like that?
2014-02-02 22:35:54	@PikFan	if you get all the grapes
2014-02-02 22:35:54	Espyo	like the Kiwis, maybe?
2014-02-02 22:35:59	@PikFan	no
2014-02-02 22:36:09	@PikFan	because those require more than 1 Pikmin
2014-02-02 22:36:23	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 22:36:35	@PikFan	and besides, they only split into halves
2014-02-02 22:36:52	Espyo	right
2014-02-02 22:36:56	Espyo	any other fruit at all?
2014-02-02 22:37:11	@PikFan	no
2014-02-02 22:37:25	@PikFan	Dawn Pustules and Dusk Pustules are the only ones that act like that
2014-02-02 22:37:40	Espyo	does the music change when you're near carrier Pikmin?
2014-02-02 22:39:42	@PikFan	you don't have to be near them
2014-02-02 22:39:52	@PikFan	and yes, the music changes when you're carrying /anything/
2014-02-02 22:40:06	@PikFan	as opposed to treasure-only in Pikmin 2
2014-02-02 22:40:14	Espyo	and all over the map?
2014-02-02 22:40:26	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:40:33	Espyo	:|
2014-02-02 22:40:38	Espyo	the remix is more upbeat, I suppose
2014-02-02 22:40:42	Espyo	not like gloomier
2014-02-02 22:40:43	Espyo	or goofier
2014-02-02 22:40:59	@PikFan	wait, actually
2014-02-02 22:41:06	@PikFan	14:40	Espyo	and all over the map?
2014-02-02 22:41:16	@PikFan	I didn't understand what you meant by that
2014-02-02 22:41:35	Espyo	 22:39	PikFan	you don't have to be near them
2014-02-02 22:41:46	Espyo	so the change in music happens without you being near the carrier Pikmin
2014-02-02 22:41:53	Espyo	which means it happens wherever you are on the map
2014-02-02 22:41:53	@PikFan	oh
2014-02-02 22:41:55	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 22:41:57	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 22:42:03	Espyo	and it /is/ cheerier, isn't it?
2014-02-02 22:42:07	@PikFan	yes
2014-02-02 22:42:19	@PikFan	it happens even if you're in a different section of the map
2014-02-02 22:42:29	Espyo	ok then
2014-02-02 22:42:32	Espyo	I guess we're ready
2014-02-02 22:42:35	Espyo	I have the perfect idea for my edit
2014-02-02 22:44:30	@J	did anything happen in the last couple of hours that I should read?
2014-02-02 22:45:17	Espyo	we discussed how the very maximum of carriers works in Pikmin 3
2014-02-02 22:45:42	Espyo	it's still a normal number, but you can add (<Pikmin needed to start carrying> - 1) Winged Pikmin to grab onto a different spot
2014-02-02 22:45:52	Espyo	add one more, and the grounded Pikmin let it go, letting the Winged carry it
2014-02-02 22:48:40	@PikFan	yep, it happened to Louie, too
2014-02-02 22:49:09	Espyo	mhm
2014-02-02 22:50:43	@PikFan	here's what wikia says (I barely can understand it):
2014-02-02 22:50:45	@PikFan	"If multiple types of Pikmin are carrying something that a Winged Pikmin is also carrying, the Winged Pikmin will carry it closer to the ground and will not fly with it. However, if the "Winged Pikmin-to-normal-Pikmin" ratio is equivilant or above the amount required to normally carry the object, they will lift the object into the air; causing any ground-base
2014-02-02 22:50:56	@PikFan	d Pikmin trying to carry the object to cling on for a few seconds before falling off."
2014-02-02 22:51:46	Espyo	hm
2014-02-02 22:52:34	@J	do Winged Pikmin carry faster?
2014-02-02 22:53:45	@PikFan	slower
2014-02-02 22:54:25	@J	hmm
2014-02-02 22:54:38	@J	that's weird as a gameplay mechanic, then
2014-02-02 22:54:43	@J	that the slower ones have priority
2014-02-02 22:55:06	@J	of course, they can often take shortcuts
2014-02-02 22:55:10	@J	but still a bit strange
2014-02-02 22:55:27	@PikFan	maybe because they're weaker...?
2014-02-02 22:57:03	Espyo	they can carry stuff out of danger's way
2014-02-02 22:57:14	Espyo	so looks like a fair trade-off
2014-02-02 22:59:45	@J	well, I should be going now
2014-02-02 22:59:46	@J	bye
2014-02-02 22:59:48	Espyo	bye
2014-02-02 22:59:49	@PikFan	bye
2014-02-02 22:59:58	@J	speedy replies there
2014-02-02 23:00:03	@PikFan	indeed
2014-02-02 23:00:10	@J	you want rid of me that much?
2014-02-02 23:00:19	@PikFan	of course
2014-02-02 23:00:20	@PikFan	not
2014-02-02 23:00:37	@J	suspicious indeed
2014-02-02 23:00:54	@PikFan	yes, we've been conniving to take over Pikipedia while you were gone
2014-02-02 23:06:45	@PikFan	oh, please
2014-02-02 23:09:52	Espyo	heheh
2014-02-02 23:15:22	Espyo	don't Bulbears revive?
2014-02-02 23:15:44	@PikFan	no
2014-02-02 23:21:01	Espyo	...
2014-02-02 23:21:14	Espyo	is the max number of Wingeds on an object the same as the max of grounded ones?
2014-02-02 23:21:29	@PikFan	yeah
2014-02-02 23:21:42	Miles	Wingeds and not-Wingeds are separate
2014-02-02 23:21:54	Espyo	separate maxes?
