2015-12-23 23:18:55	@PikFan	hi
2015-12-23 23:20:07	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-23 23:20:39	@PikFan	so what's that guy suggesting for the engine?
2015-12-23 23:20:50	@PikFan	I'm too lazy to read it all
2015-12-23 23:21:23	@Espyo	some bugs
2015-12-23 23:21:27	@Espyo	features that are already planned
2015-12-23 23:21:30	@Espyo	and not much else, really
2015-12-23 23:21:40	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-23 23:21:54	@Espyo	oh, I made it so that Pikmin spawn with the map by code
2015-12-23 23:22:02	@Espyo	because I ALWAYS need Pikmin during testing
2015-12-23 23:22:08	@Espyo	instead of adding Pikmin one by one with the editor...
2015-12-23 23:22:11	@Espyo	I just forced them to spawn
2015-12-23 23:22:14	@Espyo	the guy suggested removing that
2015-12-23 23:22:15	@Espyo	done
2015-12-23 23:22:27	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-23 23:23:03	@PikFan	also, I announced that the deletion policy will take effect on new year's

2015-12-23 23:23:19	ScruffyChat	Hey Espyo
2015-12-23 23:23:20	@PikFan	but you probably saw that
2015-12-23 23:23:27	ScruffyChat	I finally figured it out!
2015-12-23 23:23:28	@PikFan	hi ScruffyChat
2015-12-23 23:23:31	ScruffyChat	Hello!
2015-12-23 23:23:54	ScruffyChat	In the Pikmin engine, the only reason my computer didn't like the textures is because they were JPEGs
2015-12-23 23:24:00	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-23 23:24:04	ScruffyChat	I changed them to PNGs and they all show up fine!
2015-12-23 23:24:12	@Espyo	what?!
2015-12-23 23:24:16	@Espyo	that makes NO SENSE
2015-12-23 23:24:32	ScruffyChat	I know
2015-12-23 23:24:45	ScruffyChat	But it looks so good now
2015-12-23 23:25:25	@Espyo	that's such a relief
2015-12-23 23:25:32	ScruffyChat	I had just been looking through the textures and suddenly I realized that all the textures that /had/ shown up were PNGs
2015-12-23 23:25:36	@Espyo	hmmm... do Macs have a bad history with JPG files...?
2015-12-23 23:25:44	ScruffyChat	Not really
2015-12-23 23:25:54	ScruffyChat	But perhaps Windows emulators on Macs do
2015-12-23 23:26:05	@Espyo	might be Allegro's doing
2015-12-23 23:26:15	@Espyo	what about non-texture images?
2015-12-23 23:26:20	@Espyo	I think I have some jpgs on the Graphics folder
2015-12-23 23:26:25	@PikFan	oh yeah, Espyo
2015-12-23 23:26:27	@Espyo	you know, not on the Graphics/Textures folder
2015-12-23 23:26:34	@PikFan	did they ever respond?
2015-12-23 23:27:15	@Espyo	yeah, we talked back and forth some
2015-12-23 23:27:27	ScruffyChat	The only JPG in the Graphics folder that wasn't a texture was "tuto2", which I assume was your template for making the area
2015-12-23 23:27:31	@PikFan	hmm
2015-12-23 23:27:48	@PikFan	did you figure out the collisions, then?
2015-12-23 23:27:55	@Espyo	oh, about the collisions
2015-12-23 23:27:58	@Espyo	I thought you meant Fanon
2015-12-23 23:28:09	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-12-23 23:28:20	@Espyo	(one sec, playing Splatoon)
2015-12-23 23:28:25	@PikFan	I'm always so ambiguous
2015-12-23 23:28:32	@PikFan	ugh, Splatoon
2015-12-23 23:28:42	@PikFan	it's taunting me

2015-12-23 23:29:20	@PikFan	well, I just have to hold out two more days
2015-12-23 23:29:34	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-23 23:29:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah, happy holidays everyone!
2015-12-23 23:29:46	@Espyo	happy holidays!
2015-12-23 23:29:53	ScruffyChat	Sorry I've been on a bit of a hiatus
2015-12-23 23:29:56	ScruffyChat	just a sec
2015-12-23 23:29:59	@PikFan	merry Pikmas!
2015-12-23 23:30:00	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: yeah, that's my template, which can be used on the area editor
2015-12-23 23:30:09	@Espyo	anyway, the guy replied
2015-12-23 23:30:13	@Espyo	*a guy
2015-12-23 23:30:22	@Espyo	the solution he had was... heavy
2015-12-23 23:30:26	@Espyo	might be hard to implement
2015-12-23 23:30:29	@Espyo	and might impact performance
2015-12-23 23:30:32	@Espyo	but I'll try
2015-12-23 23:30:35	@PikFan	oh...
2015-12-23 23:31:00	@PikFan	he couldn't find a more optimal solution?

2015-12-23 23:33:50	@Espyo	guess not...
2015-12-23 23:34:05	@PikFan	that's too bad
2015-12-23 23:34:17	@Espyo	his solution is to check what the FIRST wall that the object collides with, and handle that
2015-12-23 23:34:19	@Espyo	which I guess makes sense
2015-12-23 23:34:21	@PikFan	well, at least you have a solution, regardless
2015-12-23 23:34:25	@Espyo	but it might be hard to do
2015-12-23 23:34:33	@Espyo	in my head, it's really heavy in performance
2015-12-23 23:34:38	@Espyo	having to check quite a few collisions and calculations
2015-12-23 23:34:55	@PikFan	maybe
2015-12-23 23:35:14	@PikFan	you won't know till you try
2015-12-23 23:37:54	@Espyo	mhm
2015-12-23 23:37:59	@Espyo	that's what I said
2015-12-23 23:38:58	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-23 23:39:30	@PikFan	oh, ScruffyChat, I worked quite a bit on my new chapter
2015-12-23 23:40:16	@PikFan	during the battle, two Burrowing Snagrets and one Pileated Snagret appear
2015-12-23 23:41:38	@PikFan	the Tree Snagret calls those reinforcements because it's quite injured

2015-12-23 23:44:54	@PikFan	ah ok
2015-12-23 23:45:17	@PikFan	so 20 Pikmin vs 4 Snagrets...
2015-12-23 23:45:22	ScruffyChat	That sounds awful
2015-12-23 23:45:36	@PikFan	indeed
2015-12-23 23:46:28	ScruffyChat	Even 50 against 1 Snagret for me is terrible
2015-12-23 23:46:39	ScruffyChat	but that's just me
2015-12-23 23:46:49	@PikFan	I agree
2015-12-23 23:46:59	ScruffyChat	I very recently completed my first no-death-run of Pikmin 2 though
2015-12-23 23:47:04	ScruffyChat	in 14 days
2015-12-23 23:47:05	@Espyo	nice
2015-12-23 23:47:08	@PikFan	yay!
2015-12-23 23:47:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2015-12-23 23:47:36	@PikFan	I'm still working on my 11 day run...
2015-12-23 23:48:04	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-12-23 23:48:10	ScruffyChat	It taught me a lot about enemy behavior
2015-12-23 23:48:22	@PikFan	nice
2015-12-23 23:48:31	ScruffyChat	sorry, you were saying?
2015-12-23 23:48:43	@PikFan	oh, how's that enemy intelligence thing going?
2015-12-23 23:49:30	ScruffyChat	Wollywog is still one of the most intelligent, Gatling Groink, and Fiery Bulblax
2015-12-23 23:50:12	@PikFan	why Fiery Bulblax...?
2015-12-23 23:50:24	ScruffyChat	Often when the Fiery Bulblax sees no other Pikmin or leaders it will start retreating, then turn around again and double check
2015-12-23 23:50:42	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-23 23:50:44	ScruffyChat	Plus it seems to be more likely to be waken up by enemy nudges than other Bulborbs

2015-12-23 23:55:17	@PikFan	oh ok so
2015-12-23 23:55:41	@PikFan	Ignis almost finds out what the bad memory was
2015-12-23 23:55:53	ScruffyChat	What was the memory again?
2015-12-23 23:56:52	@PikFan	early in chapter 4, Amber doesn't want Ignis going with them because she says "Like that one time..."

2015-12-23 23:59:44	ScruffyChat	No problem
2015-12-24 00:00:07	ScruffyChat	I'm going to have to go soon anyway
2015-12-24 00:00:15	ScruffyChat	Not for a little while, but just letting you know
2015-12-24 00:00:17	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-24 00:00:37	ScruffyChat	but, what do the Pikmin do faced with 4 snagrets?
2015-12-24 00:00:49	@PikFan	I don't know
2015-12-24 00:00:50	ScruffyChat	And do the 3 snagrets try to heal the Tree Snagret?
2015-12-24 00:01:14	@PikFan	interesting, but probably not
2015-12-24 00:01:42	@PikFan	ok, maybe 4 Snagrets is a touch too harsh
2015-12-24 00:02:06	@PikFan	maybe I should just get rid of the Pileated Snagret
2015-12-24 00:02:45	ScruffyChat	No, a Burrowing and a Pileated
2015-12-24 00:02:53	ScruffyChat	To keep the contrast
2015-12-24 00:03:07	ScruffyChat	Then it's like a gang
2015-12-24 00:03:16	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-24 00:06:23	@PikFan	by the way, how come you haven't been on lately?
2015-12-24 00:06:40	ScruffyChat	I just haven't been able to get on my computer often
2015-12-24 00:06:58	ScruffyChat	It's mainly been being with family or having to work on compositions
2015-12-24 00:07:11	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-24 00:07:20	ScruffyChat	But occasionally, mainly really really late, I can come on and do something
2015-12-24 00:07:34	ScruffyChat	Like the Red Pikmin model, I worked on that a little every day
2015-12-24 00:07:37	ScruffyChat	or, night
2015-12-24 00:07:41	@PikFan	oh, how's the Blue Pikmin with the banjo (?) going?
2015-12-24 00:07:55	ScruffyChat	I thought it would be a guitar, but good so far
2015-12-24 00:08:12	ScruffyChat	To answer your question, I do have to manually create Pikmin attributes
2015-12-24 00:08:19	ScruffyChat	But the model works for any type
2015-12-24 00:08:20	@PikFan	(hence the question mark)
2015-12-24 00:08:26	@PikFan	ah, I see
2015-12-24 00:08:52	@PikFan	so it's like a "plain" Pikmin
2015-12-24 00:08:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2015-12-24 00:09:15	@PikFan	though, how would you animate a Purple Pikmin?
2015-12-24 00:09:27	ScruffyChat	i can change the scale of the bones as well
2015-12-24 00:09:38	@PikFan	oh, neat
2015-12-24 00:09:39	ScruffyChat	so just tastefully scale up the head and torso a little
2015-12-24 00:09:46	ScruffyChat	and add some hairs
2015-12-24 00:10:22	ScruffyChat	i don't know how my computer would feel about 100 at once, but it could certainly be the beginning of fanmade Pikmin short films
2015-12-24 00:10:47	@PikFan	heh yeah, your computer might freak out
2015-12-24 00:11:15	ScruffyChat	Well, if one is 5000 polygons, then 100 is 500,000
2015-12-24 00:11:23	ScruffyChat	That's not... terrible
2015-12-24 00:11:39	ScruffyChat	But it doesn't leave room for much eles
2015-12-24 00:11:41	ScruffyChat	else*
2015-12-24 00:11:48	@PikFan	I guess not
2015-12-24 00:12:02	@PikFan	but that's just one frame
2015-12-24 00:12:21	ScruffyChat	Yeh
2015-12-24 00:12:34	@PikFan	and you have what, hundreds of frames in even just a 30 second short?
2015-12-24 00:12:44	ScruffyChat	mhmm
2015-12-24 00:12:54	ScruffyChat	But just that pikmin, with 50 samples
2015-12-24 00:12:59	@PikFan	that's millions of faces it has to render
2015-12-24 00:13:01	@PikFan	oh
2015-12-24 00:13:05	ScruffyChat	it'd only take a minute or so for one frame

2015-12-24 01:37:27	@Espyo	you could make areas since like 0.2.0
2015-12-24 01:37:34	@PikFan	wow
2015-12-24 01:37:38	@PikFan	I'm way behind
2015-12-24 01:37:41	@Espyo	it's just the editor is a bit hard to access
2015-12-24 01:37:53	@Espyo	next update will have a main menu with access to the editors, so no worries
2015-12-24 01:38:14	@PikFan	how does making areas work?
2015-12-24 01:38:25	@Espyo	you draw the polygons that make up the area
2015-12-24 01:38:29	@Espyo	each polygon is a floor
2015-12-24 01:38:31	@Espyo	its lines are walls
2015-12-24 01:38:52	@PikFan	how do you give height to the floors?

2015-12-24 01:40:47	@Espyo	you click the floor, and write down a number
2015-12-24 01:40:57	@Espyo	not as visually intuitive as drawing out the proper shapes, but there's no other way

2015-12-24 01:41:26	@PikFan	and then are there special polygons that connect floors of different heights?
2015-12-24 01:41:29	@Espyo	also I won't release the next version on christmas
2015-12-24 01:41:33	@Espyo	I'll do it on new year's
2015-12-24 01:41:39	@PikFan	fair enough
2015-12-24 01:41:45	@Espyo	good call, but not quite
2015-12-24 01:41:55	@Espyo	if you want to make a "ramp", you actually create stairs
2015-12-24 01:41:55	@PikFan	hmm
2015-12-24 01:42:05	@Espyo	and the leaders, Pikmin, etc., walk automatically up the steps
2015-12-24 01:42:15	@PikFan	interesting
2015-12-24 01:42:16	@Espyo	if steps are within a certain range, they're like a "ramp"
2015-12-24 01:42:20	@Espyo	if more than that, they're plain old walls
2015-12-24 01:43:27	@PikFan	neat
2015-12-24 01:43:39	@PikFan	so then, what obstacles can you add, if any?

2015-12-24 01:44:02	@Espyo	I would check the folder, but windows is pretty much dying

2015-12-24 03:14:56	Cheepy-Cheepy	I could make them more original... XD
2015-12-24 03:15:00	@PikFan	like, the areas from P1 came back in P2, but they had different names
2015-12-24 03:15:09	@PikFan	yeah, that, originality
2015-12-24 03:15:32	Cheepy-Cheepy	hm

2015-12-24 03:18:43	@PikFan	okay, what I meant is that the area names should be completely different

2015-12-24 03:45:37	Cheepy-Cheepy	Overwhelmed?
2015-12-24 03:45:40	Cheepy-Cheepy	No...
2015-12-24 03:45:50	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmmmm
2015-12-24 03:46:04	@PikFan	possessed sounds interesting, but it doesn't feel right
2015-12-24 03:46:05	Cheepy-Cheepy	Checking the L4D Wiki now
2015-12-24 03:46:11	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hold up
2015-12-24 03:47:20	Cheepy-Cheepy	Overrun? Maybe.
2015-12-24 03:47:59	@PikFan	occupied?
2015-12-24 03:49:13	Cheepy-Cheepy	Hm...
2015-12-24 03:50:28	Cheepy-Cheepy	It is overrun
2015-12-24 03:50:31	Cheepy-Cheepy	Okay
2015-12-24 03:51:42	Cheepy-Cheepy	Overrun Laboratory sounds good
2015-12-24 03:52:57	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-24 03:53:57	Cheepy-Cheepy	Witherring Terrace?
2015-12-24 03:54:15	Cheepy-Cheepy	Or Withering Nursery?
2015-12-24 03:55:05	@PikFan	for which area?
2015-12-24 03:55:32	Cheepy-Cheepy	Wilting Garden of Infection
2015-12-24 03:56:21	 *	Cheepy-Cheepy is currently hearing the Submerged Castle theme on the Pikmin 2 OST
2015-12-24 03:56:38	@PikFan	I guess Withering Terrace works
2015-12-24 03:56:45	Cheepy-Cheepy	Good
2015-12-24 03:56:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	I have that down already
2015-12-24 03:57:04	Cheepy-Cheepy	Do you have anything better than Rotting Oak
2015-12-24 03:59:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	Or should I even include that location
2015-12-24 03:59:26	@PikFan	your call
2015-12-24 03:59:47	Cheepy-Cheepy	I really have no need for it
2015-12-24 03:59:53	Cheepy-Cheepy	Might as well
2015-12-24 04:00:28	Cheepy-Cheepy	Any enemy types or names?
2015-12-24 04:00:32	@PikFan	alrighty
2015-12-24 04:00:37	Cheepy-Cheepy	Pikmin types or name?
2015-12-24 04:00:49	@PikFan	I'm terrible with enemies so... no, sorry
2015-12-24 04:02:00	Cheepy-Cheepy	Okay then
2015-12-24 04:02:12	Cheepy-Cheepy	I will make more creative names for them though
2015-12-24 04:02:54	Cheepy-Cheepy	But I like Vampiric Bulbear the most
2015-12-24 04:03:11	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-12-24 04:03:29	Cheepy-Cheepy	Like they have their red eyes back from the first game
2015-12-24 04:04:09	Cheepy-Cheepy	and when they successfully eat Pikmin, their health restors depending upon how many Pikmin they eat for 5% per Pikmin, 25% max
2015-12-24 04:04:29	@PikFan	ooh
2015-12-24 04:04:38	Cheepy-Cheepy	Sounds too OP though
2015-12-24 04:05:27	Cheepy-Cheepy	3% Per Pikmin, 15% max?
2015-12-24 04:05:52	@PikFan	sure, I guess
2015-12-24 04:06:08	@PikFan	though they're pretty weak anyway so it wouldn't really matter
2015-12-24 04:06:35	Cheepy-Cheepy	But the full-grown Bulbears though
2015-12-24 04:06:39	Cheepy-Cheepy	Not the lil pups
2015-12-24 04:06:47	@PikFan	oh, heh
2015-12-24 04:06:53	@PikFan	that makes more sense
2015-12-24 04:06:56	Cheepy-Cheepy	They will probably more of a boost due to their small size
2015-12-24 04:07:08	@PikFan	yeah, that's fair (about the HP regen thing)
2015-12-24 04:07:12	Cheepy-Cheepy	and how easy they die balances it
2015-12-24 04:07:41	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'm diggin it

2015-12-24 04:29:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	Instead, the Foul Whiskerpillar just pins its victim(s) to the ground and makes them vulnerable to attack
2015-12-24 04:29:53	Cheepy-Cheepy	Gives a lesson to players that leave their group of Pikmin alone

2015-12-24 04:31:45	Cheepy-Cheepy	Eventually, the Foul Whiskerpillar will be knocked off of its victim but will resume its assault if its target does not flee.
2015-12-24 04:31:51	@PikFan	I see
2015-12-24 04:31:57	Cheepy-Cheepy	Yes
2015-12-24 04:32:01	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perfect
2015-12-24 04:32:43	Cheepy-Cheepy	Perhaps the Foul Whiskerpillar is sluggish until it enters a range to quickly jump onto and temporarily pin its target?

2015-12-24 04:51:19	@PikFan	I'm actually about to send you the link
2015-12-24 04:51:41	ScruffyChat	cool!

2015-12-24 05:07:59	ScruffyChat	It's great!
2015-12-24 05:08:16	ScruffyChat	The emotion feels more detailed
2015-12-24 05:08:56	@PikFan	heh, thanks
2015-12-24 05:09:34	@PikFan	hopefully I can get this out before new year's
2015-12-24 05:09:42	@PikFan	it's been too long
2015-12-24 05:10:02	@PikFan	so, any concerns? or anything that just stood out, really?
2015-12-24 05:10:44	ScruffyChat	No, just yearning to see what happens between the four snagrets and the pikmin
2015-12-24 05:10:58	@PikFan	hehe, alright
2015-12-24 05:11:02	@PikFan	or three Snagrets
2015-12-24 05:11:03	ScruffyChat	and the explosion story was very surprising, nice touch
2015-12-24 05:11:05	@PikFan	still debating on that
2015-12-24 05:11:10	ScruffyChat	oh, yeah
2015-12-24 05:11:12	@PikFan	oh, thanks
2015-12-24 05:11:28	@PikFan	hmm?
2015-12-24 05:12:15	ScruffyChat	hmm, three snagrets would  give each one distinct character
2015-12-24 05:12:25	ScruffyChat	but four would increase the threat
2015-12-24 05:12:50	@PikFan	I think four is unpractical
2015-12-24 05:13:04	@PikFan	and too... well, too "frightening" for the beginning of the story
2015-12-24 05:13:15	@PikFan	no, not frightening
2015-12-24 05:13:18	@PikFan	it's too intense
2015-12-24 05:13:27	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-12-24 05:13:48	ScruffyChat	even one tree snagret is quite intense
2015-12-24 05:13:53	@PikFan	indeed
2015-12-24 05:14:05	ScruffyChat	you're very good at writing action
2015-12-24 05:14:10	@PikFan	probably very shortly after this is where the Winged Pikmin come in
2015-12-24 05:14:13	@PikFan	oh, thanks
2015-12-24 05:14:29	@PikFan	lots of adjectives and emotion words
2015-12-24 05:14:35	@PikFan	very effective
2015-12-24 05:14:36	ScruffyChat	yeah
2015-12-24 05:14:40	ScruffyChat	hehe
2015-12-24 05:17:57	@PikFan	but yeah, I'm thinking that Amber, Flare, and Ruby spew three streams of fire that meet together at a single point in between the Snagrets
2015-12-24 05:18:07	@PikFan	and then that single condense ball of fire explodes
2015-12-24 05:18:16	@PikFan	*condensed
2015-12-24 05:18:19	ScruffyChat	woah
2015-12-24 05:18:50	@PikFan	it scares off the other two Snagrets, but the Tree Snagret remains

2015-12-24 05:39:54	Cheepy-Cheepy	Just roll with it. XD
2015-12-24 05:40:03	Cheepy-Cheepy	Why did the chicken cross the road?
2015-12-24 05:40:13	@PikFan	I dunno, why?
2015-12-24 05:40:28	Cheepy-Cheepy	To get to the gay guy's house. Knock Knock
2015-12-24 05:40:42	@PikFan	who's there
2015-12-24 05:40:47	Cheepy-Cheepy	The chicken

2015-12-24 05:41:41	@PikFan	...then again, I hardly understand anything anyway
2015-12-24 05:41:49	Cheepy-Cheepy	The chicken went to the gay guy's house. XD
2015-12-24 05:42:02	Cheepy-Cheepy	So, all these new users, eh?
2015-12-24 05:42:13	@PikFan	what about them?
2015-12-24 05:42:29	Cheepy-Cheepy	Pretty nice having new life on the wiki.
2015-12-24 05:43:24	@PikFan	there don't seem to be that many new users
2015-12-24 05:43:27	@PikFan	or ever, really
2015-12-24 05:43:38	Cheepy-Cheepy	Even though that one dudeguy doesn't know how to put sigs after his messages
2015-12-24 05:43:52	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well, at least he puts his name so I know who typed it
2015-12-24 05:43:59	Cheepy-Cheepy	Gotta give him some credit
2015-12-24 05:44:12	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2015-12-24 05:44:50	Cheepy-Cheepy	I have a good feeling about the progress that will happen in PIP

2015-12-24 13:05:43	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-12-24 13:05:45	Testyo	but there's this guy on Pikmin Wiki, he wants to seriously consider using multiple plates at meal times
2015-12-24 13:05:48	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-24 13:05:57	@Espyo	Testyo: is it J?
2015-12-24 13:05:58	Testyo	well, that's what I call it
2015-12-24 13:06:02	@Espyo	HAHA
2015-12-24 13:06:06	Yoshi2	using MULTIPLE plates at meal plates
2015-12-24 13:06:07	Yoshi2	insane
2015-12-24 13:06:16	Yoshi2	*meal times
2015-12-24 13:07:07	Yoshi2	I have created a git project for the disassembly, but I'm not sure if I should put it on github because somebody might C&D it
2015-12-24 13:07:58	Yoshi2	well, I could put my findings (if I ever figure something out) on there sometime
2015-12-24 13:09:04	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-12-24 13:53:52	Yoshi2	Espyo: you know what would be a nightmare? If I spent all the time reading the assembler code, only to find out that most of the magic happens in the DSP
2015-12-24 13:54:08	@Espyo	...that's NOT impossible
2015-12-24 13:54:52	Yoshi2	I need to ask the arookas guy about this
2015-12-24 13:55:12	Yoshi2	maybe also ask him if he can give me a copy of the sunshine repo that he removed from his github profile
2015-12-24 13:55:13	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-24 14:34:04	Yoshi2	I'm so bad at writing mails in English
2015-12-24 14:35:02	Yoshi2	Espyo: what would be a good way to end an email?
2015-12-24 14:35:50	Yoshi2	I have trouble coming up with something that doesn't make me cringe
2015-12-24 14:36:27	@Espyo	I refuse to believe you have any sort of English trouble
2015-12-24 14:36:45	@Espyo	but a simple "Thanks!" followed by your name on the last line (right-aligned) is more than enough
2015-12-24 14:38:47	Yoshi2	it's not the content that is causing me trouble, it's just the end
2015-12-24 14:38:53	@Espyo	hm, right
2015-12-24 14:39:11	Yoshi2	Espyo: would "I'm looking forward to your reply." work?
2015-12-24 14:39:48	Yoshi2	it also doesn't help that I have one name on irc, another name on my mail, a third name on my github
2015-12-24 14:39:59	Yoshi2	all somehow related to yoshi, but still
2015-12-24 14:40:27	@Espyo	sure
2015-12-24 14:40:31	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-24 14:43:20	Yoshi2	I will just leave out the name
2015-12-24 14:43:32	Yoshi2	it's in the mail address, deal with it ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2015-12-24 14:43:57	Yoshi2	I'm not a fan of being too formal, makes the entire thing awkward
2015-12-24 14:46:54	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-24 14:48:37	Yoshi2	my uni-related emails have the bare minimum of formality ("Hello XY" and the end), the rest is just me getting to the point
2015-12-24 14:48:54	Yoshi2	I've heard that professors prefer mails that get to the point 
2015-12-24 14:49:14	@Espyo	no doubt
2015-12-24 14:50:41	Yoshi2	I can really see why
2015-12-24 14:51:10	Yoshi2	a lot of formality is just bullcrap, you can leave it out and it doesn't change the meaning of the message
2015-12-24 14:52:33	@Espyo	just padding
2015-12-24 14:53:13	@Espyo	the formality is just there to show that this is an e-mail where you really want something and don't want to brutishly step on other people's toes to get it
2015-12-24 14:53:18	@Espyo	other than that, it's just padding
2015-12-24 14:53:35	Yoshi2	yup
2015-12-24 14:54:13	Yoshi2	I feel bad writing "Ich konnte leider nicht XYZ machen." (roughly translates to "Sadly, I couldn't do XYZ.")
2015-12-24 14:54:29	Yoshi2	because it really feels like padding
2015-12-24 14:54:52	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-12-24 14:55:01	@Espyo	I thought the email was going to be in English though
2015-12-24 14:55:25	Yoshi2	yes, I meant that as a more general thing when I write an uni email about me messing something up
2015-12-24 14:55:32	@Espyo	h
2015-12-24 14:55:33	@Espyo	*oh
2015-12-24 14:55:41	@Espyo	eh, maybe it's a bit of padding
2015-12-24 14:57:06	Yoshi2	in most situations, displaying emotions in the text isn't too helpful
2015-12-24 15:04:09	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-24 16:13:35	Yoshi2	here is to hope that the guy didn't change mails in the last few months
2015-12-24 16:14:14	@Espyo	yeah

2015-12-25 18:57:49	Yoshi2	Espyo: well, seems like most BMS magic happens on the CPU, and the DSP probably just handles the stuff the BMS is translated into
2015-12-25 18:58:11	@Espyo	I figured as much
2015-12-25 18:58:16	@Espyo	it's what makes sense
2015-12-25 18:58:44	Yoshi2	and he removed the SMS repository for legal reasons, as I assumed
2015-12-25 18:59:04	Yoshi2	I sent him another email asking him if he can name some address in SMS that I can check out in relation to BMS
2015-12-25 19:00:18	@Espyo	was he actually approached, or did he do it out of caution?
2015-12-25 19:00:25	Yoshi2	out of caution
2015-12-25 19:00:38	@Espyo	well, that's slightly comforting

2015-12-25 21:58:57	@Espyo	...took a while to reply
2015-12-25 21:59:10	@Espyo	IRC just seems to be acting weird all around in the past few minutes
2015-12-25 21:59:15	@Espyo	oh, and Steam is going crazy for everybody
2015-12-25 21:59:24	@Espyo	showing people pages with logged-in accounts that aren't theirs
2015-12-25 21:59:58	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 22:00:16	Yoshi2	some say that the cache server messed up, caching pages which shouldn't be cached
2015-12-25 22:00:28	@Espyo	that would honestly explain it
2015-12-25 22:00:34	Yoshi2	which I find more likely than there being some major breach at steam
2015-12-25 22:00:34	Neocraftz1553	yup
2015-12-25 22:00:51	@Espyo	yeah, there's no breach
2015-12-25 22:00:53	@Espyo	that's just crazy
2015-12-25 22:01:02	@Espyo	and if there were, people wouldn't be seeing it like THAT, for sure
2015-12-25 22:01:28	Yoshi2	although considering the information that could be seen on the user pages, it's almost as good as a breach

2015-12-25 22:21:41	Neocraftz1553	For the engine, can you put hazards yet? sorry if my questions are annoying in advance :d
2015-12-25 22:21:47	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-25 22:21:50	@Espyo	don't worry
2015-12-25 22:21:59	@Espyo	uh, I can make hazards a priority, sure
2015-12-25 22:22:09	@Espyo	right now, I'm just picking stuff to implement next, there's no real order
2015-12-25 22:22:10	Neocraftz1553	oh ok.
2015-12-25 22:22:12	@Espyo	so sure, hazards
2015-12-25 22:22:30	Neocraftz1553	cause I was tryong to figure out how to enable them or something
2015-12-25 22:23:38	Neocraftz1553	anyways, I can't believe how easy it is to "program" more pikmin into the engine

2015-12-25 22:25:47	@Espyo	heh, thanks
2015-12-25 22:25:53	@Espyo	I tried to make it as simple and immediate as possible
2015-12-25 22:26:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah. Once you get the hang of it, you just need the textures and stuff, but it is incredibly easy
2015-12-25 22:28:27	@Espyo	good, I was worried that people would find it hard
2015-12-25 22:29:31	Neocraftz1553	yeah.
2015-12-25 22:31:15	Neocraftz1553	The only thing remotely hard that I just finished doing is resizing an enemy along with hitboxes and things... but, that could be because I don't have much time on my hands...
2015-12-25 22:31:29	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File_talk:Flame_Tiller.jpg I'm not quite sure what we should do with this...
2015-12-25 22:31:45	@Espyo	no, resizing is hard, because you have to do it by hand
2015-12-25 22:31:59	@Espyo	ideally, you'd have the final size right at the start
2015-12-25 22:32:07	@Espyo	precisely to avoid having to change the size and resize hitboxes and such
2015-12-25 22:32:15	@Espyo	but yeah, it sucks when you're creating clone enemies

2015-12-25 22:37:47	@Espyo	I'm guessing really young people wouldn't *shrug*
2015-12-25 22:38:00	@Espyo	like... 10-year olds
2015-12-25 22:38:04	@Espyo	specially at this day and age
2015-12-25 22:38:17	@Espyo	plus even for older people

2015-12-25 22:38:35	@Espyo	I had a total of like 2 yo-yos in my lifetime
2015-12-25 22:39:05	Neocraftz1553	I went through 3-4 maybe
2015-12-25 22:39:09	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 22:39:26	Neocraftz1553	my pikmin just leave the treasure by the ship

2015-12-25 22:39:46	@Espyo	I don't think I EVER got treasure sucking-in to work
2015-12-25 22:39:51	@Espyo	oh, btw
2015-12-25 22:39:54	@Espyo	I saw the map you made
2015-12-25 22:39:56	@Espyo	looks really great
2015-12-25 22:40:01	@Espyo	even with the limited way the engine currently is
2015-12-25 22:40:04	Neocraftz1553	I'll try to program that maybe
2015-12-25 22:40:10	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 22:40:15	@Espyo	it'll only look better when I add in water and such
2015-12-25 22:40:18	Neocraftz1553	evrn I was surprised
2015-12-25 22:40:45	@Espyo	it's actually one of the things that made me smile the most
2015-12-25 22:40:50	Neocraftz1553	oh, yeah. google images works swell for water textures and such
2015-12-25 22:41:04	@Espyo	I was not sure at all how well areas would look from a top-down view, with my subpar area generation algorithms
2015-12-25 22:41:13	@Espyo	but I started making areas, and damn, it looks pretty satisfactory
2015-12-25 22:41:27	@Espyo	my problem isn't so much the water images as it is how to make the water animate
2015-12-25 22:41:33	@Espyo	well, how to make it animate is simple
2015-12-25 22:41:44	@Espyo	...but how in the world do I make convincing water as seen from a top-down view?
2015-12-25 22:41:54	@Espyo	without being brutally heavy on performance
2015-12-25 22:41:54	Neocraftz1553	yes I've seen the engine since the talk about it started, but never got around to getting it
2015-12-25 22:42:03	Neocraftz1553	and to make water convincing
2015-12-25 22:42:49	Neocraftz1553	maybe add another layer of dirt/sand underneath it and then a checkbox as to if you want water present on that sector
2015-12-25 22:43:01	Neocraftz1553	you know
2015-12-25 22:43:07	@Espyo	yeah, that's the plan
2015-12-25 22:43:07	Neocraftz1553	like a 2nd layer
2015-12-25 22:43:18	@Espyo	but just a layer of water on top won't look very good
2015-12-25 22:43:22	@Espyo	I'll have to animate that second layer somehow
2015-12-25 22:43:23	@Espyo	but how?
2015-12-25 22:43:26	@Espyo	I can't bend it around
2015-12-25 22:43:32	@Espyo	I mean... I can, but I think that that'll be really heave
2015-12-25 22:43:34	@Espyo	*heavy
2015-12-25 22:43:43	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2015-12-25 22:43:43	@Espyo	last time I tried distorting a texture, it cut the performance in half
2015-12-25 22:43:45	@Espyo	*shudder*
2015-12-25 22:44:30	Neocraftz1553	lol, performance, not graphics
2015-12-25 22:45:07	Neocraftz1553	try to keep it balanced a little towards performance, but not too much that its a blank screen
2015-12-25 22:46:34	Neocraftz1553	my engine is running at 50fps, but for some reason the area editor sometimes crashes, making me go into the text file and fishing out the errors and such
2015-12-25 22:47:04	Neocraftz1553	but it is alpha, so bugs and other magic things will happen
2015-12-25 22:47:21	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-12-25 22:47:29	@Espyo	it's just that performance is really scaring me
2015-12-25 22:47:31	@Espyo	...AND confusing me
2015-12-25 22:47:37	Neocraftz1553	why?
2015-12-25 22:47:43	Neocraftz1553	to me it looks fine
2015-12-25 22:47:49	@Espyo	with 100 Pikmin on-screen, it runs at like 25fps on my machine
2015-12-25 22:47:56	@Espyo	which is not a great one by any means, but it's so-so
2015-12-25 22:48:09	Neocraftz1553	did you put the fps up in options?
2015-12-25 22:48:14	@Espyo	on a friend's machine, that is from like 2007, it runs at like 100fps with 100 Pikmin
2015-12-25 22:48:25	Neocraftz1553	huh...
2015-12-25 22:48:27	@Espyo	yeah, unlimited fps (just set it to like 99999)
2015-12-25 22:48:37	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 22:48:40	@Espyo	granted, every time I run it, I do so with debugging tools
2015-12-25 22:48:44	@Espyo	but... they're not THAT heavy...
2015-12-25 22:48:57	Neocraftz1553	I have 99 pikmin right now
2015-12-25 22:49:08	@Espyo	anyway, if I can assure that it runs well at 60fps on my machine in most scenarios, I am 100% sure it'll run at at least 30fps on pretty much all machines
2015-12-25 22:49:27	@Espyo	I'm not really in a position to worry about performance, since I'm just a single developer working on such tiny time frames
2015-12-25 22:49:39	@Espyo	but it sucks that I'm making this, somebody really wants to try it, and can't experiment it because I made it so sow
2015-12-25 22:49:40	@Espyo	*slow
2015-12-25 22:49:58	UltraMario	hi
2015-12-25 22:50:03	Neocraftz1553	I'll expirement it, if you want
2015-12-25 22:50:06	Neocraftz1553	hey
2015-12-25 22:50:18	@Espyo	experiment what, exactly?
2015-12-25 22:50:21	Neocraftz1553	you know, beta tests and such
2015-12-25 22:50:37	Neocraftz1553	area editors, new Ideas you implement
2015-12-25 22:50:47	Neocraftz1553	anything really
2015-12-25 22:50:56	@Espyo	I appreciate it
2015-12-25 22:51:10	@Espyo	sometimes I really need somebody else to check if X or Y is working okay before I drop it to work on something else
2015-12-25 22:51:16	@Espyo	hey, you said the editor was crashing
2015-12-25 22:51:19	@Espyo	which editor? the area one?
2015-12-25 22:51:38	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 22:51:45	@Espyo	what did the error log say?
2015-12-25 22:52:15	Neocraftz1553	the error log said enemy "none" unrecognized
2015-12-25 22:52:30	@Espyo	and that caused it to crash?!
2015-12-25 22:53:04	Neocraftz1553	it crashed when I saved with a red object thing(none) and searched for bugs, then it crashed. then aft
2015-12-25 22:53:17	@Espyo	oh damn
2015-12-25 22:53:21	Neocraftz1553	then after that, I opened it, it crashed
2015-12-25 22:53:22	@Espyo	I have to see this
2015-12-25 22:53:34	@Espyo	did you edit the text file manually to remove the object?
2015-12-25 22:53:34	Neocraftz1553	 so I had to erase the none thing
2015-12-25 22:53:49	Neocraftz1553	4 of them, actually
2015-12-25 22:54:15	@Espyo	yikes
2015-12-25 22:54:20	@Espyo	thanks for letting me know, I'll fix it
2015-12-25 22:54:26	Neocraftz1553	random crashes when you search for bugs too
2015-12-25 22:54:31	@Espyo	I'm planning on releasing a new version on new year's
2015-12-25 22:54:35	@Espyo	so this fix will go along with it
2015-12-25 22:54:46	@Espyo	oh, the error finder is really glitchy...
2015-12-25 22:54:52	@Espyo	I'll try to add some foolproofs to it too, thanks
2015-12-25 22:55:03	@Espyo	hey, if you can send me the map you have, I'll be able to see why it's crashing
2015-12-25 22:55:04	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 22:55:20	Neocraftz1553	k, but how
2015-12-25 22:55:32	Neocraftz1553	wait
2015-12-25 22:55:41	@Espyo	hm... sharing stuff online is STILL a horrible mess
2015-12-25 22:55:42	Neocraftz1553	I ll upload it to mediafire
2015-12-25 22:55:46	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 22:55:47	@Espyo	sure
2015-12-25 22:55:49	@Espyo	oh, actually
2015-12-25 22:55:53	@Espyo	because maps are just text files
2015-12-25 22:55:56	Neocraftz1553	mediafire is my only source
2015-12-25 22:55:57	@Espyo	you can use something much more immediate
2015-12-25 22:56:02	@Espyo	use pastebin

2015-12-25 22:56:13	@Espyo	just slap it and send me the URL, done
2015-12-25 22:56:28	Neocraftz1553	ooooh... but the map has other stuff too
2015-12-25 22:56:35	Neocraftz1553	custom textures
2015-12-25 22:56:36	@Espyo	other stuff?

2015-12-25 22:56:54	@Espyo	well, I guess the error finder will find problems about missing textures
2015-12-25 22:56:58	@Espyo	and that'll bog me down a bit
2015-12-25 22:57:17	Neocraftz1553	Ill remove them best I can
2015-12-25 22:57:32	@Espyo	oh, don't worry
2015-12-25 22:58:25	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2015-12-25 22:59:25	@Espyo	don't worry about the custom textures
2015-12-25 22:59:35	@Espyo	I can just make the engine not report texture problems lol
2015-12-25 22:59:37	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-25 22:59:43	@Espyo	and then I'll focus on the problems that are ACTUALLY making the editor crash...
2015-12-25 22:59:43	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 23:00:01	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-25 23:00:15	Neocraftz1553	you MIGHT get some misc things
2015-12-25 23:00:42	Neocraftz1553	new pikmin but besides that everythings normal
2015-12-25 23:00:48	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-12-25 23:00:57	@Espyo	well, I don't think it'll matter
2015-12-25 23:01:09	@Espyo	what's making the editor crash is probably a problem like a vertex stuck inside another one
2015-12-25 23:01:18	@Espyo	and that'll happen regardless of whatever custom stuff you had
2015-12-25 23:01:22	@Espyo	so I only really need the map
2015-12-25 23:01:45	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-25 23:02:35	Neocraftz1553	now just wait a sec while I try to manually copy/paste the file from my computer to my phone...
2015-12-25 23:03:21	@Espyo	yikes
2015-12-25 23:03:29	Neocraftz1553	yup
2015-12-25 23:03:37	Neocraftz1553	it wont take long
2015-12-25 23:03:55	@Espyo	still, it's the easiest way
2015-12-25 23:03:59	@Espyo	good thing you don't need to send anything else
2015-12-25 23:04:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 23:04:59	@Espyo	uhm
2015-12-25 23:05:04	Neocraftz1553	wut
2015-12-25 23:05:06	@Espyo	I added an object without giving it a category or type
2015-12-25 23:05:08	@Espyo	saved
2015-12-25 23:05:08	@Espyo	loaded
2015-12-25 23:05:10	@Espyo	and it didn't crash
2015-12-25 23:05:25	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 23:05:35	Neocraftz1553	I've done that lots of times
2015-12-25 23:05:41	@Espyo	oh, so it only crashes sometimes?
2015-12-25 23:05:50	Neocraftz1553	but for some reason it crashed
2015-12-25 23:05:54	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-12-25 23:05:59	Neocraftz1553	on this one map
2015-12-25 23:06:05	@Espyo	and it kept crashing till you deleted the "none" objects?
2015-12-25 23:06:30	Neocraftz1553	no... 
2015-12-25 23:06:35	Neocraftz1553	for some reason
2015-12-25 23:07:14	Neocraftz1553	I click one object, and then I leave it as "none" then I click another, it crashes
2015-12-25 23:07:33	@Espyo	oh, okay
2015-12-25 23:07:43	Neocraftz1553	so I have to add objects quickly before it crashes
2015-12-25 23:08:17	@Espyo	how weird
2015-12-25 23:08:19	@Espyo	can't reproduce it
2015-12-25 23:08:30	Neocraftz1553	*shrugs*
2015-12-25 23:09:42	@Espyo	well, if it happens again, send me the map that that happens with and I'll try to do the same steps you do
2015-12-25 23:09:53	@Espyo	in the meantime, how's the copy-paste of the map that breaks when finding errors?

2015-12-25 23:17:11	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 23:17:21	@Espyo	ok, I'll check the crashes in a bit

2015-12-25 23:19:51	@Espyo	this glitch with clicking on "Go to error" when the error is gone is really something
2015-12-25 23:19:58	@Espyo	it's pointing me to somewhere else on the code

2015-12-25 23:21:04	@Espyo	I'll have to make it so that if you quit out of the review screen, it forgets any error search you made
2015-12-25 23:21:28	@Espyo	so that you can't like, get an error about an object with no type, go remove it, and then try to press the Go to error button on the review screen
2015-12-25 23:21:29	Neocraftz1553	yeah...
2015-12-25 23:21:40	@Espyo	it's not that much of a hassle for the user anyway
2015-12-25 23:21:50	@Espyo	I mean, if you quit out of the review screen, that's because you went to fix the problem
2015-12-25 23:21:57	@Espyo	so you don't need the problem to be there when you return to the review screen
2015-12-25 23:22:00	@Espyo	so *shrug*
2015-12-25 23:22:08	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 23:22:30	Neocraftz1553	unless the problem is of a texture that dpes indeed exist, then its useless
2015-12-25 23:24:32	Neocraftz1553	hey, uh, you know. the engine you made is really something
2015-12-25 23:24:52	@Espyo	huh, it can report an error about a texture that doesn't exist, but that in reality, does exist?
2015-12-25 23:25:11	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah, Dirt.png
2015-12-25 23:25:16	@Espyo	what
2015-12-25 23:25:23	@Espyo	did you remove the texture at any point?
2015-12-25 23:25:33	Neocraftz1553	no.
2015-12-25 23:25:41	Neocraftz1553	It is useful
2015-12-25 23:25:54	Neocraftz1553	It looks like dirt
2015-12-25 23:25:59	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-25 23:26:04	@Espyo	why in the world is it reporting that...?
2015-12-25 23:26:08	@Espyo	does it happen commonly?
2015-12-25 23:26:17	Neocraftz1553	kind of
2015-12-25 23:26:18	@Espyo	what about error log.txt? does it have any mention of dirt.png not being found?
2015-12-25 23:26:21	Neocraftz1553	let me check
2015-12-25 23:26:25	Neocraftz1553	no
2015-12-25 23:26:32	@Espyo	...this makes no sense
2015-12-25 23:27:05	Neocraftz1553	yeah it happens everytime
2015-12-25 23:27:16	Neocraftz1553	I tried it on another map
2015-12-25 23:27:23	@Espyo	but the texture definitely exists, yeah?
2015-12-25 23:27:28	@Espyo	even shows up fine if you play the map, right?
2015-12-25 23:27:32	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-25 23:27:51	Neocraftz1553	in fact, the txt file I sent you has it
2015-12-25 23:27:59	@Espyo	oh, nice
2015-12-25 23:28:02	@Espyo	I'll check then
2015-12-25 23:28:03	Neocraftz1553	The engine comes with the texture
2015-12-25 23:28:12	Neocraftz1553	surprisingly
2015-12-25 23:28:30	@Espyo	yeah, making it even dumber
2015-12-25 23:28:31	Neocraftz1553	you'd think it would show a custome texture as an error
2015-12-25 23:28:44	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 23:29:17	Neocraftz1553	today I'm going to upload a picture on my talk page maybe in a few mins

2015-12-25 23:30:08	@Espyo	try it
2015-12-25 23:30:14	@Espyo	try setting a sector's texture to like asdasdasdas.png
2015-12-25 23:30:20	@Espyo	you'll be pleasantly surprised

2015-12-25 23:47:47	@Espyo	check your folder
2015-12-25 23:47:50	@Espyo	you might have a .png

2015-12-25 23:48:07	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 23:48:25	@Espyo	even right-click it, check properties, to make sure it's a jpeg file
2015-12-25 23:48:26	Neocraftz1553	ahhh yes
2015-12-25 23:48:40	Neocraftz1553	I have both
2015-12-25 23:48:55	@Espyo	that might be the problem
2015-12-25 23:49:02	@Espyo	it's not expecting two textures with the same name
2015-12-25 23:49:07	@Espyo	I USED to have a .png for the Dirt texture
2015-12-25 23:49:12	@Espyo	but then I realized I should try to save space
2015-12-25 23:49:21	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-25 23:49:24	@Espyo	there won't be a noticeable difference between the original PNG and a compressed JPG
2015-12-25 23:49:27	@Espyo	so I just switch to JPG for that
2015-12-25 23:49:29	@Espyo	and a few others
2015-12-25 23:49:45	@Espyo	try deleting the PNG, fix the area to use the JPG, and let me know if it still works
2015-12-25 23:49:52	@Espyo	might need to restart the engine, since it's kinda finnicky
2015-12-25 23:50:03	Neocraftz1553	yeah it works with both
2015-12-25 23:50:14	Neocraftz1553	I'm using the Png though
2015-12-25 23:50:24	Neocraftz1553	it looks better next to water

2015-12-26 00:06:04	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@216.4.vy.imx) has joined #pikipedia
2015-12-26 00:06:17	Neocraftz1553	Im back
2015-12-26 00:06:24	Neocraftz1553	again
2015-12-26 00:10:27	@Espyo	ok, so I fixed the error finder thing
2015-12-26 00:10:28	@Espyo	no more problems
2015-12-26 00:10:37	Neocraftz1553	cool
2015-12-26 00:10:40	Neocraftz1553	so
2015-12-26 00:11:02	Neocraftz1553	how much things have you implemented since the last update
2015-12-26 00:11:28	@Espyo	not much
2015-12-26 00:11:30	@Espyo	main menu + options
2015-12-26 00:11:41	@Espyo	White Spectralid
2015-12-26 00:11:41	Neocraftz1553	what do you mean
2015-12-26 00:11:51	@Espyo	there's no main menu currently, right?
2015-12-26 00:11:53	Neocraftz1553	main menu as in game or othr
2015-12-26 00:11:56	Neocraftz1553	ooooh
2015-12-26 00:11:57	@Espyo	I added a main menu, like the one in Pikmin 2
2015-12-26 00:12:00	@Espyo	plus an options menu
2015-12-26 00:12:00	Neocraftz1553	awsome
2015-12-26 00:12:06	Neocraftz1553	cool
2015-12-26 00:12:18	@Espyo	it's a way to access the editors, options (controls only atm), quit, or start playing "Play"
2015-12-26 00:12:28	@Espyo	I haven't made a stage selection yet because I'm not quite sure how I'll do it
2015-12-26 00:12:41	@Espyo	when I have a better idea of how menus will be in the games proper, I'll add something
2015-12-26 00:12:41	Neocraftz1553	yeah, even Im stumped
2015-12-26 00:12:45	@Espyo	'cause like
2015-12-26 00:12:54	@Espyo	if the maps are to be considered like challenge mode maps, for now
2015-12-26 00:12:57	@Espyo	since each map is standalone
2015-12-26 00:13:07	Neocraftz1553	maybe the stage selction should be like
2015-12-26 00:13:07	@Espyo	I could make a level select like Pikmin 1, 2, or 3, for their challenge modes
2015-12-26 00:13:13	Neocraftz1553	A list
2015-12-26 00:13:21	Neocraftz1553	cool
2015-12-26 00:13:24	@Espyo	but if the stages are meant to be like proper areas in story mode, it'll have to have an overworld image with parts you can click
2015-12-26 00:13:34	@Espyo	so this really requires looking REALLY ahead into the future
2015-12-26 00:13:42	@Espyo	I'm afraid you'll have to only use Play for now
2015-12-26 00:13:49	Neocraftz1553	yeah, but, for now a list is good
2015-12-26 00:13:55	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-26 00:13:59	@Espyo	I'll try to add a list
2015-12-26 00:14:01	Neocraftz1553	its fine
2015-12-26 00:14:02	<--	Festivefreak (NewYokuba@tje-051-024-560-02.socal.res.rr.com) has quit (Quit: nwehehehe)
2015-12-26 00:14:04	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-26 00:14:07	@Espyo	I'll see if I have time till new year's
2015-12-26 00:14:29	Neocraftz1553	meanwhile , im here trying to come up with stuff to add to the engine
2015-12-26 00:14:30	@Espyo	anyway, when you said that the "find errors" function was crashing
2015-12-26 00:14:33	@Espyo	when was it crashing exactly?
2015-12-26 00:14:48	@Espyo	when you started the search for errors, when you clicked on "Go to error", or just random crashes anywhere?
2015-12-26 00:14:49	Neocraftz1553	since I got it, vanilla
2015-12-26 00:15:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah, random crashes on the find error
2015-12-26 00:15:26	Neocraftz1553	I do something, save, then find errors
2015-12-26 00:15:32	Neocraftz1553	sometimes it crashes
2015-12-26 00:15:40	Neocraftz1553	sometimes it feels generous
2015-12-26 00:15:40	@Espyo	got any map that will crash, atm?
2015-12-26 00:15:54	Neocraftz1553	what do you mean
2015-12-26 00:16:00	Neocraftz1553	immediatly?
2015-12-26 00:16:02	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-26 00:16:08	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:16:14	@Espyo	please send me it, then
2015-12-26 00:17:39	Neocraftz1553	every map that doesn't have space to spawn the pikmin in about X=-4 and Y=155... it will probably fix later when the force spawning gets removed
2015-12-26 00:18:44	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2015-12-26 00:19:06	@Espyo	wait, you mean a map with no place for the auto-Pikmin will cause a crash on the find errors feature?
2015-12-26 00:19:30	Neocraftz1553	no, on the game engine
2015-12-26 00:19:36	Neocraftz1553	as soon as you start
2015-12-26 00:19:41	@Espyo	ah, good
2015-12-26 00:19:43	@Espyo	yeah, makes sense
2015-12-26 00:19:50	Neocraftz1553	and it won't show up in the errors
2015-12-26 00:19:51	@Espyo	trying to spawn stuff out of bounds... I can't imagine that ending up well
2015-12-26 00:19:54	Neocraftz1553	yeah it does
2015-12-26 00:20:03	@Espyo	right, no worries
2015-12-26 00:20:07	@Espyo	it'll be fixed in 5 days ;)
2015-12-26 00:20:27	Neocraftz1553	a little troublesome, but, once you figure it out, alls well
2015-12-26 00:20:32	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-26 00:20:42	Neocraftz1553	wait, 5 days?
2015-12-26 00:20:59	@Espyo	yeah, new year's
2015-12-26 00:21:09	Neocraftz1553	Your releasing the engine that early
2015-12-26 00:21:15	@Espyo	well, the next version
2015-12-26 00:21:23	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:21:37	@Espyo	with the main menu, options, White Spectralid these glitches fixed, etc.
2015-12-26 00:21:49	Neocraftz1553	dang, your a programing wizard
2015-12-26 00:22:04	@Espyo	I already had most of them made
2015-12-26 00:22:05	Neocraftz1553	and an artist
2015-12-26 00:22:10	@Espyo	it's been two months since the last update
2015-12-26 00:22:12	Neocraftz1553	still
2015-12-26 00:22:13	@Espyo	nah, I'm no artist
2015-12-26 00:22:22	@Espyo	I can do OKAY art, but that's it, really
2015-12-26 00:22:35	@Espyo	hm, I was checking if I had anything else to do on the engine of immediate importance
2015-12-26 00:22:37	@Espyo	...and I guess not
2015-12-26 00:22:42	@Espyo	which means I'll add a stage select menu
2015-12-26 00:23:06	Neocraftz1553	yeah, another 5 months wait then?
2015-12-26 00:23:30	Neocraftz1553	I think I can do some really cool stuff until then
2015-12-26 00:24:34	Neocraftz1553	using mah photoshop, I can make aby sprite out of the red/blue pikmin sprites
2015-12-26 00:24:48	@Espyo	after I finish this version, I guess I'll work on hazards
2015-12-26 00:24:53	Neocraftz1553	lol, really, I'm the worst drawer
2015-12-26 00:24:53	@Espyo	who knows how long I'll take to release that version
2015-12-26 00:25:06	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:25:06	@Espyo	luckily, the sprites are so small, you don't need to mess with many details
2015-12-26 00:25:16	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:25:34	Neocraftz1553	like the 'big red nose'
2015-12-26 00:25:42	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-26 00:25:45	Neocraftz1553	just chop it right off
2015-12-26 00:25:51	Neocraftz1553	make some carrot stew
2015-12-26 00:26:39	Neocraftz1553	yeah, but once I put a lot of work into a sprite, and I forgot I based it on red pikmin, so I had to redo it with red pikmin sprited
2015-12-26 00:27:08	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-12-26 00:27:16	@Espyo	maybe I should release a "template"
2015-12-26 00:27:24	@Espyo	so people can color on top and such
2015-12-26 00:27:27	Neocraftz1553	sure
2015-12-26 00:28:19	Neocraftz1553	but make it red/yellow/blue with no features and such, since photoshop can't 'detect those colors
2015-12-26 00:28:33	@Espyo	right
2015-12-26 00:28:42	Neocraftz1553	no, I mean it vant detect grey/white xd
2015-12-26 00:28:46	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 00:28:49	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-26 00:28:53	@Espyo	yeah, I was thinking of making them white
2015-12-26 00:29:01	@Espyo	so you can just paint your colors on top
2015-12-26 00:29:08	@Espyo	but then it'd blend with the eyes and all |:
2015-12-26 00:29:21	@Espyo	see, it's easier when you edit the vectorial image straight away
2015-12-26 00:29:29	Neocraftz1553	grey with white eyes?
2015-12-26 00:29:36	@Espyo	probably the best way
2015-12-26 00:29:41	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:30:20	Neocraftz1553	they can probably edit the flower from the graphics
2015-12-26 00:30:28	Neocraftz1553	just copy/paste
2015-12-26 00:31:11	Neocraftz1553	so, yeah I'm finishing up a light blue pikmin Icon
2015-12-26 00:31:39	@Espyo	I have to rework the icons somehow
2015-12-26 00:32:03	Neocraftz1553	what do you mean
2015-12-26 00:32:51	@Espyo	the current icons, the ones you see on the HUD, are taken from Pikmin 2
2015-12-26 00:32:58	@Espyo	and they're already janky as they are
2015-12-26 00:33:02	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:33:04	Neocraftz1553	so
2015-12-26 00:33:05	@Espyo	I mean, they're all in different poses, look weird
2015-12-26 00:33:09	@Espyo	heck, some of them even have weird colors
2015-12-26 00:33:13	@Espyo	have you seen all of the Blue Pikmin icons?
2015-12-26 00:33:18	@Espyo	some are blue, others are like cyan
2015-12-26 00:33:18	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 00:33:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:33:28	@Espyo	the Pikmin 2 devs did that, since I got the textures straight from it >_>
2015-12-26 00:33:39	Neocraftz1553	the last one is
2015-12-26 00:33:43	@Espyo	but either way, it also makes it hard for other people to add their own icons
2015-12-26 00:33:51	@Espyo	so maybe I should make icons work a different way
2015-12-26 00:33:55	@Espyo	like, all of them facing the same way and such
2015-12-26 00:33:57	@Espyo	like Pikmin 3!
2015-12-26 00:34:02	@Espyo	at least it makes it easier to edit
2015-12-26 00:34:05	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:34:09	@Espyo	also probably not show the maturity on the HUD
2015-12-26 00:34:22	@Espyo	it makes it a bit simpler, but there's never really any need to know the next Pikmin's maturity...
2015-12-26 00:34:28	@Espyo	maturity only really matters in bulk
2015-12-26 00:34:34	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:34:36	@Espyo	like 100 leaves vs 100 flowers, that's important
2015-12-26 00:34:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:34:48	@Espyo	but if you need ONE Yellow Pikmin to kill that Bulborb, you don't care about its maturity
2015-12-26 00:35:01	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:35:06	Neocraftz1553	but
2015-12-26 00:35:24	Neocraftz1553	maturity isn't really in the game quite yet...
2015-12-26 00:35:31	@Espyo	it actually is
2015-12-26 00:35:34	Neocraftz1553	except for the occasional bud
2015-12-26 00:35:37	Neocraftz1553	ik
2015-12-26 00:35:42	@Espyo	there's nectar, too
2015-12-26 00:35:48	Neocraftz1553	but most are flowers
2015-12-26 00:35:51	@Espyo	and it works, very barebones, but it does
2015-12-26 00:35:58	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 00:36:02	@Espyo	I don't think maturity affects anything on the engine at the moment, though
2015-12-26 00:36:02	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-26 00:36:07	@Espyo	well, whatever
2015-12-26 00:36:14	@Espyo	I can probably do something else new for the engine
2015-12-26 00:36:21	@Espyo	I don't want to make the HUD design decisions
2015-12-26 00:36:30	@Espyo	because it should be up to each game's maker as to how it should look
2015-12-26 00:36:35	Neocraftz1553	I CAN help you make all pikmin face the same way...
2015-12-26 00:36:38	@Espyo	but there's also no good way to customize the HUD, so I'll HAVE to make SOME choices
2015-12-26 00:36:47	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:36:56	@Espyo	I'm thinking of having a bubble with an icon for the next Pikmin type
2015-12-26 00:37:02	@Espyo	and then a smaller bubble next to it indicating its maturity
2015-12-26 00:37:03	Neocraftz1553	the game makers have to replace the HUD files
2015-12-26 00:37:07	@Espyo	just with a leaf/bud/flower
2015-12-26 00:37:17	@Espyo	that way, people can add new Pikmin without having to create icons for ALL maturities
2015-12-26 00:37:20	Neocraftz1553	soundz giood
2015-12-26 00:37:38	@Espyo	and thanks for the offer, but I'll try making them myself first, to try to get a consistent style going
2015-12-26 00:37:49	@Espyo	plus, to experiment with what seems good, makes sense with the HUD, makes sense to customize, etc.
2015-12-26 00:37:53	Neocraftz1553	heh heh ok
2015-12-26 00:38:12	@Espyo	I didn't check if you used it
2015-12-26 00:38:22	@Espyo	but on the engine, you can create sectors that serve only to blend the textures around them
2015-12-26 00:38:30	@Espyo	if you check Play, you have grass, and some parts have dirt blending in
2015-12-26 00:38:41	@Espyo	it looks a LOT nicer than what I thought initially
2015-12-26 00:38:52	@Espyo	and it gives so much smoothness and livelihood to a map
2015-12-26 00:39:01	@Espyo	I have to try to implement plants soon
2015-12-26 00:39:05	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:39:07	@Espyo	I bet they'll add a lot of ambience with minimum effort
2015-12-26 00:39:11	Neocraftz1553	its called fade
2015-12-26 00:39:15	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-26 00:39:22	@Espyo	oh!
2015-12-26 00:39:23	@Espyo	one thing
2015-12-26 00:39:29	Neocraftz1553	hm
2015-12-26 00:39:30	@Espyo	when I release this next version
2015-12-26 00:39:34	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:39:35	@Espyo	or one of the next few versions
2015-12-26 00:39:40	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2015-12-26 00:39:40	@Espyo	...your maps will glitch out
2015-12-26 00:39:49	Neocraftz1553	lol why
2015-12-26 00:39:50	@Espyo	there's a simple fix
2015-12-26 00:39:56	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:39:56	@Espyo	I'll have to change the way wall collisions work
2015-12-26 00:40:05	Neocraftz1553	oh
2015-12-26 00:40:16	@Espyo	like, every wall LINE has the side that is the actual wall, and the other side that's like the lower ground
2015-12-26 00:40:23	@Espyo	and internally, stuff is stored in one way
2015-12-26 00:40:31	@Espyo	but when the next versions come out, it'll have to be stored another way
2015-12-26 00:40:37	@Espyo	because really, REALLY confusing code shenanigans lol
2015-12-26 00:40:48	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 00:40:50	@Espyo	I won't be able to add any tool to automatically swap the way the engine reads the walls
2015-12-26 00:40:51	@Espyo	but
2015-12-26 00:40:56	@Espyo	it can be done with the area's text files
2015-12-26 00:41:02	Neocraftz1553	how
2015-12-26 00:41:10	@Espyo	if you open an area and check the linedefs section
2015-12-26 00:41:16	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:41:20	@Espyo	you'll see a lot of lines like v = 45 67
2015-12-26 00:41:22	@Espyo	or stuff like that
2015-12-26 00:41:28	Neocraftz1553	yup
2015-12-26 00:41:33	@Espyo	all that needs to be done is to switch those two numbers around, for every linedef
2015-12-26 00:41:38	@Espyo	...of course this is horribly long
2015-12-26 00:41:43	@Espyo	but there's a simple workaround
2015-12-26 00:41:46	@Espyo	do you use Notepad++?
2015-12-26 00:41:59	Neocraftz1553	no
2015-12-26 00:42:06	Neocraftz1553	Ill have to get it lster
2015-12-26 00:42:08	@Espyo	you should, it's infinite times better than regular Notepad
2015-12-26 00:42:08	Neocraftz1553	later
2015-12-26 00:42:14	Neocraftz1553	rly
2015-12-26 00:42:17	@Espyo	mhm
2015-12-26 00:42:22	@Espyo	regular Notepad just opens files and... that's it
2015-12-26 00:42:26	@Espyo	Notepad++ does everything
2015-12-26 00:42:30	Neocraftz1553	oh quick question
2015-12-26 00:42:35	@Espyo	at the very least you should get it because Notepad's undo sucks >_>
2015-12-26 00:42:45	Neocraftz1553	yes it does
2015-12-26 00:42:53	@Espyo	either way, you can also send me the maps and I can fix them here myself
2015-12-26 00:42:55	Neocraftz1553	especially when tweaking things
2015-12-26 00:42:56	@Espyo	literally takes 10 seconds per map
2015-12-26 00:43:06	@Espyo	yeah, do get Notepad++ then
2015-12-26 00:43:23	Neocraftz1553	I only have one map that needs tweaking
2015-12-26 00:43:31	Neocraftz1553	the bulborb one
2015-12-26 00:43:39	@Espyo	what do you tweak exactly?
2015-12-26 00:43:59	Neocraftz1553	The number switch thing
2015-12-26 00:44:23	@Espyo	all maps would need that, actually
2015-12-26 00:44:30	Neocraftz1553	but, will pikmin AI be implemented yet?
2015-12-26 00:44:45	Neocraftz1553	oh, I just need the bulborb map
2015-12-26 00:45:02	@Espyo	the one you posted an image of?
2015-12-26 00:45:07	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah
2015-12-26 00:45:20	@Espyo	but either way, we can check later
2015-12-26 00:45:30	@Espyo	I'm not even sure WHEN I'll add the wall collision change
2015-12-26 00:45:38	@Espyo	I'm still trying to work it out... it's tricky
2015-12-26 00:45:45	@Espyo	what do you mean by Pikmin AI?
2015-12-26 00:45:55	Neocraftz1553	pikmin to onion
2015-12-26 00:46:02	@Espyo	oh, the path they take
2015-12-26 00:46:05	Neocraftz1553	you should add simple pathfinding
2015-12-26 00:46:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:46:12	@Espyo	eh, I can try to add that next too
2015-12-26 00:46:17	@Espyo	I'll never be able to add anything automatic
2015-12-26 00:46:18	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:46:24	Neocraftz1553	true
2015-12-26 00:46:27	@Espyo	the person who makes a map will also have to specify the paths
2015-12-26 00:46:37	@Espyo	I'm imagining it in my head, and I think it'll be easy
2015-12-26 00:46:46	Neocraftz1553	Oh
2015-12-26 00:46:53	Neocraftz1553	than thats better
2015-12-26 00:47:23	Neocraftz1553	but, if you do that, wont all pikmin types take it to one onion only?
2015-12-26 00:47:25	@Espyo	[[Carrying#Paths]]
2015-12-26 00:47:26	Testyo	"Carrying#Paths" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Carrying#Paths
2015-12-26 00:47:35	@Espyo	if I'm smart enough, nope :)
2015-12-26 00:47:45	@Espyo	I'll make it so you specify the general path throughout the areas
2015-12-26 00:47:50	@Espyo	like the paths on that article I linked to just now
2015-12-26 00:48:09	@Espyo	and then the Pikmin can just see for themselves
2015-12-26 00:48:13	@Espyo	if the path ends on the landing site...
2015-12-26 00:48:17	@Espyo	make a beeline for the Onion they want
2015-12-26 00:48:26	Neocraftz1553	ok cool

2015-12-26 00:49:39	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah, im back
2015-12-26 00:49:50	Neocraftz1553	I checked the article
2015-12-26 00:49:50	@Espyo	so yeah, I can't imagine it being too hard to do for the map makers
2015-12-26 00:49:51	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/15/WW_paths.png
2015-12-26 00:50:00	@Espyo	they just have to add dots like the ones on that image
2015-12-26 00:50:02	Neocraftz1553	no not that hard
2015-12-26 00:50:12	Neocraftz1553	the green one
2015-12-26 00:50:14	@Espyo	probably even simpler since the dots and lines in Pikmin 2 have different sizes
2015-12-26 00:50:15	Neocraftz1553	s
2015-12-26 00:50:20	@Espyo	...for reasons I can't explain
2015-12-26 00:50:22	@Espyo	yeah, the green ones
2015-12-26 00:50:24	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:50:45	Neocraftz1553	Kinda confused myself, but I will learn how to use it
2015-12-26 00:50:50	@Espyo	it's simple
2015-12-26 00:51:01	@Espyo	when the Pikmin start carrying, they check the nearest green circle
2015-12-26 00:51:04	@Espyo	then they go to it
2015-12-26 00:51:12	@Espyo	and from there, they just follow the web
2015-12-26 00:51:20	@Espyo	I can make them decide by themselves which path to take
2015-12-26 00:51:30	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2015-12-26 00:51:32	@Espyo	so long that you, in any point of the map, give them a point to head off to
2015-12-26 00:51:36	@Espyo	they should be able to find the way themselves
2015-12-26 00:51:38	Neocraftz1553	its actually very simple
2015-12-26 00:51:41	@Espyo	going through the web
2015-12-26 00:51:43	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-26 00:52:02	@Espyo	might take a while to implement that, though
2015-12-26 00:52:04	@Espyo	but I'll check
2015-12-26 00:52:15	Neocraftz1553	they grab something, check the nearest green circle, and then repeat until they get to their destination
2015-12-26 00:52:19	@Espyo	if I can get hazards in really quickly, I might try to add pathing as well
2015-12-26 00:52:27	@Espyo	not quite
2015-12-26 00:52:33	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:52:36	@Espyo	once they go to a circle, imagine that they're in the "web"
2015-12-26 00:52:44	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:52:45	@Espyo	they then navigate the web
2015-12-26 00:52:50	@Espyo	you (the map maker) create the web
2015-12-26 00:52:56	@Espyo	you have to say that this dot can connect to that dot
2015-12-26 00:53:00	Neocraftz1553	i have the power
2015-12-26 00:53:00	@Espyo	they can't decide that for themselves
2015-12-26 00:53:10	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-26 00:53:19	@Espyo	they can't decide, because they might try to go from one point to a point on a really high floor, and get stuck on the wall |:
2015-12-26 00:53:32	@Espyo	so you're the one that has to tell them that from that point, they can only take this path
2015-12-26 00:53:38	@Espyo	it should be intuitive, no worries
2015-12-26 00:53:41	Neocraftz1553	it may bring bugs, but it sounds great
2015-12-26 00:53:44	Neocraftz1553	i get it
2015-12-26 00:53:49	Neocraftz1553	its like a web
2015-12-26 00:53:57	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-26 00:54:04	@Espyo	there's probably a better name for it than "web"
2015-12-26 00:54:10	@Espyo	this sort of mechanic is used all the time in games
2015-12-26 00:54:15	@Espyo	it's technically a node tree
2015-12-26 00:54:18	@Espyo	a graph
2015-12-26 00:54:32	Neocraftz1553	some bugs may be the map makers not even putting the dots there/connecting the dots
2015-12-26 00:54:33	@Espyo	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29
2015-12-26 00:54:39	@Espyo	yep, exactly
2015-12-26 00:54:39	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 00:54:44	@Espyo	but the engine can't do anything about that, I'm afraid...
2015-12-26 00:55:02	Neocraftz1553	but overall, the pros outweigh the cons
2015-12-26 00:55:09	@Espyo	for sure
2015-12-26 00:55:12	Neocraftz1553	better than nothing
2015-12-26 00:55:18	@Espyo	the most the engine can do is warn that a certain point isn't connected
2015-12-26 00:55:32	@Espyo	of course, I could implement something that checks all the walls, free spaces, free walking routes, etc.
2015-12-26 00:55:41	@Espyo	...it would take years to implement, and years for Pikmin to find a path in-game
2015-12-26 00:55:44	Neocraftz1553	that would take long
2015-12-26 00:55:51	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 00:56:00	@Espyo	probably make the game run at like 1fps as well :V
2015-12-26 00:56:02	@Espyo	so no way
2015-12-26 00:56:13	Neocraftz1553	yeah simple is good
2015-12-26 00:56:22	@Espyo	yup
2015-12-26 00:56:35	@Espyo	but yeah, I'll try to add hazards and paths
2015-12-26 00:56:47	@Espyo	actually, which one do you want me to give priority to?
2015-12-26 00:56:51	@Espyo	I can do either one first
2015-12-26 00:56:57	@Espyo	at this point, I'm just picking from the list and doing it
2015-12-26 00:57:01	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2015-12-26 00:57:11	@Espyo	and nobody else is really in a rush to get any specific thing in the engine
2015-12-26 00:57:13	@Espyo	so *shrug*
2015-12-26 00:57:17	Neocraftz1553	it would be good to have path finding
2015-12-26 00:57:25	@Espyo	all right
2015-12-26 00:57:34	@Espyo	let's see...
2015-12-26 00:57:55	@Espyo	I can imagine half of my time will be creating the area editor interface for the map maker to add the paths with
2015-12-26 00:57:57	Neocraftz1553	maybe hazards could be like the weather thing once you finish pathfinding
2015-12-26 00:58:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:58:09	@Espyo	weather hazards will be very low-priority
2015-12-26 00:58:16	@Espyo	for one thing, weather is low-priority as-is
2015-12-26 00:58:19	Neocraftz1553	no not that
2015-12-26 00:58:25	@Espyo	hm?
2015-12-26 00:58:39	Neocraftz1553	like the text file under configurations named weather
2015-12-26 00:58:43	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-26 00:58:48	@Espyo	yeah, I think it'll be something like that
2015-12-26 00:58:59	@Espyo	but then I'll have to make enemies, gates, etc., be able to use hazards
2015-12-26 00:59:07	@Espyo	and for Pikmin to be invulnerable to hazards too
2015-12-26 00:59:11	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-26 00:59:16	@Espyo	hm, and I might have to implement status effects too
2015-12-26 00:59:23	@Espyo	status effects being like choking, burning, etc.
2015-12-26 00:59:36	@Espyo	otherwise hazards aren't very convincing
2015-12-26 00:59:50	@Espyo	I can make it so that if a Pikmin touches a hazard it's not invulnerable to, it can get insta-killed
2015-12-26 00:59:58	@Espyo	at least until I implement choking, burning, etc.
2015-12-26 01:00:05	Neocraftz1553	so maybe you could release the new update on new years and then 6.2 a weeks later?
2015-12-26 01:00:11	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah
2015-12-26 01:00:32	Neocraftz1553	at least instant kill than no kill
2015-12-26 01:00:33	@Espyo	 6.2?
2015-12-26 01:00:37	@Espyo	why 6.2? lol
2015-12-26 01:00:43	Neocraftz1553	lol cheesy yes i know
2015-12-26 01:01:04	@Espyo	oh yeah, the next version is 0.6.0
2015-12-26 01:01:06	Neocraftz1553	but it isnt a very big update if theres just hazards
2015-12-26 01:01:15	@Espyo	iunno, I'd call it a big update
2015-12-26 01:01:18	@Espyo	it's an entire game mechanic
2015-12-26 01:01:20	Neocraftz1553	and hazards are cool
2015-12-26 01:01:24	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2015-12-26 01:01:28	Neocraftz1553	6.7
2015-12-26 01:01:30	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 01:01:35	@Espyo	maybe not entire as in complete, but hey, it's a game mechanic
2015-12-26 01:01:46	Neocraftz1553	alright it is good
2015-12-26 01:01:48	@Espyo	if it's a new game mechanic, I'll increase the big number of the version
2015-12-26 01:01:55	@Espyo	if it's like bug-fixes and such, I'll increase the second number

2015-12-26 01:03:15	Neocraftz1553	jk
2015-12-26 01:03:24	@Espyo	then start working on path-finding
2015-12-26 01:03:26	@Espyo	then hazards
2015-12-26 01:03:31	@Espyo	heh, I should skip 9 and go to 10
2015-12-26 01:03:33	@Espyo	like windows
2015-12-26 01:03:37	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-26 01:03:57	Neocraftz1553	ok so 7.0 brings path finding and hazards
2015-12-26 01:04:05	@Espyo	or maybe just path finding
2015-12-26 01:04:07	@Espyo	depends
2015-12-26 01:04:11	@Espyo	if I take like 6 months to do path finding
2015-12-26 01:04:16	@Espyo	I'll release it with just path finding

2015-12-26 18:10:54	Chiaki_Nanami	You cannot finish a game of Civilization or Starcraft unless they have campaigns that I'm unaware of.
2015-12-26 18:13:25	Yoshi2	I'm currently doing the sc2 legacy of the void campaign, and I've started a round of civ with a friend which I call finished when we dominate everbody
2015-12-26 18:16:23	Yoshi2	but yeah, civiliation has no campaigns and you could play it forever, and starcraft has the multiplayer which you can't finish either

2015-12-26 19:15:35	En_Passant	Got P3 yesterday
2015-12-26 19:15:52	En_Passant	Naturally, I spent all day finishing it
2015-12-26 19:16:21	En_Passant	All Fruits in 24 Days
2015-12-26 19:16:29	@Espyo	hah, nice
2015-12-26 19:16:44	En_Passant	341 deaths, but I'm pretty sure at least half of those were in the Formidable Oak/Plasm Wraith
2015-12-26 19:17:07	@Espyo	eep
2015-12-26 19:18:43	En_Passant	Yeah, um, accidentally threw the bomb rocks I gathered while attacking the MLF when it had Olimar
2015-12-26 19:18:55	En_Passant	Lost half of my squad
2015-12-26 19:19:19	@Espyo	I think pretty much everybody had a bomb accident at one point
2015-12-26 19:19:57	En_Passant	I also had a Sandbelching Meerslug accident
2015-12-26 19:20:00	UltraMario	En_Passant	Yeah, um, accidentally threw the bomb rocks I gathered while attacking the MLF when it had Olimar
2015-12-26 19:20:04	UltraMario	you rang? :^)
2015-12-26 19:20:17	En_Passant	lol
2015-12-26 19:20:32	UltraMario	also
2015-12-26 19:20:40	UltraMario	i heard you asking how to take a screenshot the other day
2015-12-26 19:20:41	UltraMario	well
2015-12-26 19:20:51	UltraMario	you can go on the internet browser and upload it like that
2015-12-26 19:20:52	En_Passant	That was last night lol
2015-12-26 19:20:56	UltraMario	yeah :P
2015-12-26 19:21:44	En_Passant	I wasn't referring to an in-game screenshot, like the ones you do with the KopPad
2015-12-26 19:22:09	En_Passant	I wanted to get the last-day one, though it turns out it was already data-mined
2015-12-26 19:22:17	En_Passant	*last-day journal entry
2015-12-26 19:24:31	En_Passant	But back to my story
2015-12-26 19:24:50	En_Passant	I knew it was possible to attack the Meerslug while it was in its sandpit
2015-12-26 19:25:19	En_Passant	But I thought Pikmin would just do that if they were nearby, so I ran in and got close to it
2015-12-26 19:25:21	UltraMario	yeah i know
2015-12-26 19:25:24	En_Passant	... that didn't work
2015-12-26 19:25:30	UltraMario	you can use the browser for whatever screenshots
2015-12-26 19:25:32	UltraMario	:p
2015-12-26 19:26:16	En_Passant	So you go the browser
2015-12-26 19:26:31	En_Passant	And then capture the GamePad screen using ???
2015-12-26 19:26:31	UltraMario	and go on an image upload site
2015-12-26 19:26:37	UltraMario	and then
2015-12-26 19:26:54	UltraMario	if you have a game suspended, it uploads whatever is on the current screen of the game
2015-12-26 19:27:33	En_Passant	Can you get the GamePad that way?
2015-12-26 19:27:52	UltraMario	yeah, you can either upload the tv screen or gamepad screen
2015-12-26 19:27:54	UltraMario	not both though
2015-12-26 19:28:04	UltraMario	at the same time, anyway
2015-12-26 19:42:18	En_Passant	I've been thinking about this experience in relation to Pikmin V
2015-12-26 19:43:00	En_Passant	One of the things I wanted was for the game to be even bigger than 3, but I imagined it would still be manageable with 3 captains
2015-12-26 19:44:34	En_Passant	Now that I've seen firsthand how large P3 is, I'm not sure if such a size would be too much
2015-12-26 19:51:59	UltraMario	>V
2015-12-26 19:52:04	UltraMario	but 4 isnt even out yet 
2015-12-26 19:52:04	UltraMario	:P
2015-12-26 19:53:51	En_Passant	V doesn't necessarily mean 5
2015-12-26 19:54:52	UltraMario	it does to me
2015-12-26 19:54:53	UltraMario	;p
2015-12-26 20:01:33	En_Passant	Have you seen it?
2015-12-26 20:02:43	UltraMario	seen what
2015-12-26 20:02:48	En_Passant	Pikmin V
2015-12-26 20:12:31	UltraMario	no
2015-12-26 20:13:06	En_Passant	[[f:Pikmin V]]
2015-12-26 20:13:07	Testyo	"Pikmin_V" article = http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_V
2015-12-26 20:13:23	En_Passant	shameless promoting
2015-12-26 20:13:31	UltraMario	so why is it "V" anyway? :P
2015-12-26 20:15:04	En_Passant	Because it fits with the theme of the games' names while not technically using a number so it won't conflict with canon
2015-12-26 20:15:23	En_Passant	Plus, V's a cool letter
2015-12-26 20:18:16	UltraMario	:p
2015-12-26 20:22:53	Yoshi2	I agree that V is a cool letter

2015-12-26 23:41:21	En_Passant	I got somewhat reckless overall when doing the re-visits
2015-12-26 23:41:29	En_Passant	Lots of dumb crap because I didn't bother killing enemies

2015-12-26 23:43:12	En_Passant	It was fun, no doubt
2015-12-26 23:44:08	En_Passant	I loved trying hard to be efficient

2015-12-26 23:45:23	En_Passant	The bosses weren't quite as fun

2015-12-27 22:04:18	@Espyo	nice
2015-12-27 22:04:48	Neocraftz1553	a little question
2015-12-27 22:05:00	Neocraftz1553	I'm making a stone wall in the engine
2015-12-27 22:05:06	Neocraftz1553	but it crashes
2015-12-27 22:05:24	@Espyo	...
2015-12-27 22:05:40	@Espyo	does it always crash with the same wall?
2015-12-27 22:05:55	Neocraftz1553	 yeah, I'm trying to fix it
2015-12-27 22:07:51	Neocraftz1553	fixed
2015-12-27 22:08:12	--	Pi is now known as slPi
2015-12-27 22:08:17	Neocraftz1553	lol forgot I put a black pikmin onion out of bounds
2015-12-27 22:09:34	Neocraftz1553	so um, Espyo, How do you think bomb rocks will work in the future?
2015-12-27 22:10:14	Neocraftz1553	will they just damage things(do massive damage) or will they functionally take down stone walls?
2015-12-27 22:10:41	@Espyo	both, likely
2015-12-27 22:10:43	Neocraftz1553	right now I made the stone wall have 50000 health
2015-12-27 22:11:08	@Espyo	oh, you mean stone wall as in an obstacle?
2015-12-27 22:11:12	@Espyo	I thought you meant a sector on the area editor
2015-12-27 22:11:18	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah
2015-12-27 22:11:18	@Espyo	well, what did you forget that made the engine crash?
2015-12-27 22:11:29	Neocraftz1553	lol forgot I put a black pikmin onion out of bounds
2015-12-27 22:11:35	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-27 22:11:58	Neocraftz1553	a little glitch I think you should kinda fix in the update
2015-12-27 22:12:01	Neocraftz1553	well no
2015-12-27 22:12:05	Neocraftz1553	a big glitch
2015-12-27 22:12:40	Neocraftz1553	sometimes a leader cannot enter a sector as if it was a wall
2015-12-27 22:12:52	Neocraftz1553	this CAN be fixed, however
2015-12-27 22:13:19	Neocraftz1553	by going into the area editor and changing the height by 1
2015-12-27 22:14:51	@Espyo	whaa?
2015-12-27 22:14:58	Neocraftz1553	also, gates can only face right/left simultaniously, but not north/south
2015-12-27 22:15:12	@Espyo	huh?
2015-12-27 22:15:19	@Espyo	they should be able to face any direction
2015-12-27 22:15:30	@Espyo	anyway, do you have a map where I can see one of these "fake" wall sectors?
2015-12-27 22:16:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-27 22:16:25	Neocraftz1553	its missing some textures, but it'll do
2015-12-27 22:17:34	Neocraftz1553	lol just checked the heights... I can't enter a 'fake wall' sector from an area higher than it
2015-12-27 22:17:49	Neocraftz1553	Ill send the map to you

2015-12-27 22:22:38	Neocraftz1553	I made purple pikmin slower overall, attack speed, etc. but stronger...the only problem was the animations. I fixed them eventually thogh
2015-12-27 22:22:49	Neocraftz1553	*though
2015-12-27 22:23:17	@Espyo	thanks
2015-12-27 22:24:00	Neocraftz1553	hey espyo, do you know how to rip textures from pikmin 2?
2015-12-27 22:24:17	@Espyo	if you have Dolphin and a ROM of the game, it's easy
2015-12-27 22:24:46	Neocraftz1553	do you think you could rip the tile texture?
2015-12-27 22:24:59	Neocraftz1553	the one in the perplexing pool
2015-12-27 22:27:40	@Espyo	sure
2015-12-27 22:27:44	@Espyo	but only tomorrow
2015-12-27 22:27:49	Neocraftz1553	heh ok
2015-12-27 22:27:53	@Espyo	actually, I might have them here, hang on
2015-12-27 22:28:02	@Espyo	I saved a lot of textures at one point
2015-12-27 22:28:49	Neocraftz1553	I Would have had them... but I could download pikmin 2...
2015-12-27 22:29:12	Neocraftz1553	ooooh I get it
2015-12-27 22:29:31	Neocraftz1553	Nevermind espyo, you dont have to check the map
2015-12-27 22:29:59	Neocraftz1553	the sector is xonnected to a gate, which makes the engine think it is a gate sector
2015-12-27 22:30:27	Neocraftz1553	I destroyed the gate and it allowed me to pass through the sector
2015-12-27 22:31:52	@Espyo	ph
2015-12-27 22:31:55	@Espyo	*oh
2015-12-27 22:31:55	@Espyo	hehehe
2015-12-27 22:31:57	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-27 22:32:00	@Espyo	that's meant to happen
2015-12-27 22:32:09	@Espyo	the sector the gate is on is always a wall sector
2015-12-27 22:32:14	@Espyo	technically, the gates have no collision
2015-12-27 22:32:15	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-27 22:32:19	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2015-12-27 22:32:21	@Espyo	they only serve as an object for Pikmin to attack
2015-12-27 22:32:38	@Espyo	I'll write a tutorial
2015-12-27 22:32:43	Neocraftz1553	I didn't know that 'till I studied the test map

2015-12-27 22:44:39	@Espyo	well, it makes sense
2015-12-27 22:44:56	@Espyo	as far as the engine cares, the transparent pixels aren't floor
2015-12-27 22:44:56	@Espyo	they're nothingness

2015-12-27 22:55:36	@Espyo	I'll check it out tomorrow, I guess

2015-12-27 23:00:57	Neocraftz1553	but I'm making another one kind of like it
2015-12-27 23:01:12	Neocraftz1553	it's inspired by forest navel like the other one

2015-12-27 23:29:30	@PikFan	alrighty
2015-12-27 23:29:40	@Espyo	I'm playing with some friends and chatting on skype
2015-12-27 23:29:41	@PikFan	booting up Splatoon right now
2015-12-27 23:29:44	@Espyo	so we are probably VERY coordinated
2015-12-27 23:29:44	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-27 23:29:52	@Espyo	so if you land on the enemy team... don't beat yourself up too badly :V
2015-12-27 23:29:53	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-27 23:30:14	@PikFan	I bet you guys are much better than I am
2015-12-27 23:31:07	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-27 23:31:12	@Espyo	we probably have over 100 hours clocked
2015-12-27 23:31:13	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-27 23:31:17	@Espyo	but you'll get there
2015-12-27 23:31:24	@Espyo	I'll let you know if you do something you shouldn't, okay?
2015-12-27 23:31:32	@PikFan	okay
2015-12-27 23:31:34	@Espyo	plus the usual tips
2015-12-27 23:31:48	@PikFan	ugh, GamePad's about to die
2015-12-27 23:31:49	@PikFan	brb
2015-12-27 23:31:53	@Espyo	I was going to say that you may have a hard time joining our room
2015-12-27 23:31:56	@Espyo	because of all the higher level people
2015-12-27 23:32:03	@Espyo	but the matchmaking's been broken for the past week
2015-12-27 23:32:10	@Espyo	it's pairing up level 5s with level 50s and all
2015-12-27 23:32:18	@Espyo	so this room is probably balanced all-around
2015-12-27 23:32:53	@PikFan	right
2015-12-27 23:33:08	@PikFan	on Christmas morning I saw people saying "so many noobs ugh"
2015-12-27 23:33:25	@PikFan	ok, trying to join now...
2015-12-27 23:33:27	@Espyo	nope, even before that it was nuts
2015-12-27 23:33:44	@PikFan	huh
2015-12-27 23:33:45	@PikFan	weird

2015-12-27 23:36:40	@Espyo	the matchmaking used to be pretty bad before
2015-12-27 23:36:44	@Espyo	or well, subpar
2015-12-27 23:36:54	@Espyo	fetching a LOT of Japanese players for the European players
2015-12-27 23:36:59	@Espyo	pairing low-levels with high-levels
2015-12-27 23:36:59	@Espyo	etc.
2015-12-27 23:37:10	@Espyo	then last week they released an update that "improved" the matchmaking
2015-12-27 23:37:14	@Espyo	it's been 10 times worse ever since

2015-12-28 20:26:53	@Espyo	but in more seriousness, it's starting to pop up a LOT
2015-12-28 20:27:07	@Espyo	I haven't heard about this glitch until the past 4 or 5 months
2015-12-28 20:27:11	@Espyo	where it just started appearing everywhere
2015-12-28 20:27:24	@Espyo	first time I crossed it was at a friend's, on Defeat Bosses! Quaggled Mireclops
2015-12-28 20:27:32	@Espyo	then I've seen it show up on Miiverse at least 4 times
2015-12-28 20:27:34	@Espyo	now your image

2015-12-28 20:28:43	Neocraftz1553	No explanation whatsoever on the glitch
2015-12-28 20:28:52	En_Passant	The way the glitch happened for me was different than what's on the page
2015-12-28 20:28:58	En_Passant	It persisted when I switched leaders
2015-12-28 20:29:05	Neocraftz1553	I've been able to do the one in pikmin 1
2015-12-28 20:29:30	Neocraftz1553	That glitch is troublesome
2015-12-28 20:29:52	En_Passant	I think what happens is you switch leaders at the same time that the one you switch to gets blown away

2015-12-28 20:30:38	En_Passant	It brings up the prompt to mash the control stick to get up, which might interfere with updating the GUI
2015-12-28 20:31:56	@Espyo	yeah, the Pikmin 1 one is so common
2015-12-28 20:31:57	En_Passant	But I can't say for sure, because I don't know if I noticed it as soon as it occurred
2015-12-28 20:32:06	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-28 20:32:11	@Espyo	well, but I got it to happen on co-op
2015-12-28 20:32:15	@Espyo	no leader switching was involved
2015-12-28 20:32:28	@Espyo	at least I'm quite sure we didn't switch leaders
2015-12-28 20:33:00	Neocraftz1553	a very confusing glitch indeed
2015-12-28 20:34:18	Neocraftz1553	I wonder what Pikmin 4 will bring
2015-12-28 20:34:26	Neocraftz1553	kinda off topic

2015-12-28 20:35:23	Yoshi2	when pikmin kill each other, they always stand around for a bit before disappearing, which points to some sort of synchronization issue
2015-12-28 20:36:20	Neocraftz1553	or they just feel guilty for killing one of their own

2015-12-28 20:46:30	Yoshi2	well, some sort of synch system is probably needed for local co-op
2015-12-28 20:48:46	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo
2015-12-28 20:49:03	@Espyo	local co-op on different consoles, sure
2015-12-28 20:49:04	@Espyo	yeah?
2015-12-28 20:49:16	Scruffy	I figured out what I was trying to say when I wrote that nectar and walls stay lit in caves even when you're far away from them
2015-12-28 20:49:36	@Espyo	I'm not quite sure I remember there being a problem about that...
2015-12-28 20:49:39	@Espyo	let me check the history
2015-12-28 20:49:47	Scruffy	It's in the talk page
2015-12-28 20:50:22	@Espyo	ah, I see it
2015-12-28 20:51:19	Scruffy	Both nectar and walls are trying to simulate a property called subsurface scattering
2015-12-28 20:51:54	Scruffy	When light hits a surface like skin, honey, stone, you name it
2015-12-28 20:52:00	Scruffy	It doesn't all just reflect off
2015-12-28 20:52:13	Scruffy	Some light bounces around inside the surface and then gets reflected
2015-12-28 20:52:29	Scruffy	Any picture of cheese will really demonstrate this for you
2015-12-28 20:52:36	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-28 20:53:10	Yoshi2	well, it's probably more likely that the devs just implemented pikmin fights in a quick and dirty way in P3
2015-12-28 20:53:19	@Espyo	I'm seeing on Wikipedia
2015-12-28 20:53:23	@Espyo	that is actually incredibly amazing
2015-12-28 20:53:31	Scruffy	So when nectar drops or walls are far away, they still have residual amounts of light bouncing through them
2015-12-28 20:53:53	Scruffy	And in P3, they really amazingly simulate it in all the fruits
2015-12-28 20:54:02	Scruffy	That's really what makes them look so real
2015-12-28 20:54:48	Scruffy	The legs of the Onions in P3 also do this
2015-12-28 20:54:54	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-12-28 20:55:08	Scruffy	I can't believe I hadn't thought of it that way, I use it all the time in Blender

2015-12-28 20:56:28	@Espyo	so, lemme see if I get this straight
2015-12-28 20:56:51	@Espyo	subsurface scattering is basically the phenomenon of more light going through semi-transparent things, as opposed to more opaque?
2015-12-28 20:57:31	Scruffy	Yes, but not just going through, bouncing around inside the material as well
2015-12-28 20:57:42	@Espyo	right, right
2015-12-28 20:57:46	@Espyo	and Pikmin 2 really does use that?
2015-12-28 20:57:47	Scruffy	Which is why scattered light can pick up different colors
2015-12-28 20:58:02	Scruffy	Well, they have a simple way to try and imitate that look
2015-12-28 20:58:07	@Espyo	right
2015-12-28 20:58:20	Scruffy	But yes, I believe that's what they were going for
2015-12-28 20:58:33	@Espyo	how can you confirm that it's SSS that's causing the lighting thing?
2015-12-28 20:58:41	Scruffy	I can't
2015-12-28 20:58:50	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-12-28 20:58:56	@Espyo	really wish we had a picture somewhere
2015-12-28 20:59:07	Scruffy	Hang on, I can pull it up fast
2015-12-28 20:59:31	@Espyo	honestly, for nectar, I could almost discard it as transparency being stupid
2015-12-28 20:59:41	@Espyo	the darkness in the distance is just fog
2015-12-28 20:59:48	@Espyo	and having something transparent on fog usually ends in disaster

2015-12-28 21:01:45	@Espyo	really weird stuff
2015-12-28 21:01:57	@Espyo	hm, it might be worth checking it out on Dolphin and disabling all sorts of things
2015-12-28 21:02:01	@Espyo	like external frame buffer, or fog
2015-12-28 21:02:03	Yoshi2	oh wow, that joke (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞

2015-12-28 21:10:46	@Espyo	I'll be back in like 20
2015-12-28 21:10:49	Scruffy	cool
2015-12-28 21:10:54	@Espyo	if this code works, it should disable all Exploration Kit items

2015-12-28 22:09:26	@Espyo	dragging around the tree shadows on the editor makes them stuck to the cursor
2015-12-28 22:09:35	@Espyo	and it's possible to walk out of bounds
2015-12-28 22:09:44	Neocraftz1553	you didnt know

2015-12-28 22:10:08	@Espyo	then it was possible again
2015-12-28 22:10:08	Neocraftz1553	but sometimes you'll get stuck
2015-12-28 22:10:11	@Espyo	then I made it not possible again

2015-12-28 22:42:18	Neocraftz1553	what other 'plugins' are there for the object text files?
2015-12-28 22:42:36	@Espyo	plugins like what?
2015-12-28 22:44:01	Neocraftz1553	Like the "throw_height_multiplier" in purble pikmin and the "chomp_max_victims" for the CBN
2015-12-28 22:44:25	@Espyo	I'll have to check a complete list
2015-12-28 22:44:31	@Espyo	I'll add it to the tutorials I'll make tomorrow
2015-12-28 22:44:37	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-28 22:44:38	@Espyo	it's a bit of a long list
2015-12-28 22:44:41	@Espyo	I can't just get it off the hook
2015-12-28 22:44:42	@Espyo	sorry
2015-12-28 22:44:52	Neocraftz1553	its ok
2015-12-28 22:45:12	Neocraftz1553	any guesses?
2015-12-28 22:46:05	@Espyo	depends on the ones you already know and the ones you don't
2015-12-28 22:46:15	@Espyo	but in general, I don't think there are any that aren't already set on the existing enemies and Pikmin
2015-12-28 22:46:23	@Espyo	like, if you look at their files, you should see all of them
2015-12-28 22:46:33	@Espyo	even some of them that used to exist, but don't any more
2015-12-28 22:47:08	Neocraftz1553	ok ill check them. i bet there are more though
2015-12-28 22:48:47	Neocraftz1553	also how does chomp_max_victims work?
2015-12-28 22:48:58	Neocraftz1553	I put 5 and it only gets 1
2015-12-28 22:49:08	@Espyo	that's one of the old ones
2015-12-28 22:49:19	Neocraftz1553	:'(
2015-12-28 22:49:22	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-28 22:49:26	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-28 22:49:39	@Espyo	the way it works now is that, on the script, when you set which hitboxes will do the chomping, you also say the max number of Pikmin that will die

2015-12-28 22:52:53	Neocraftz1553	you can really tell the difference if you get my pack. put a purple and a red pikmin side by side attacking
2015-12-28 22:53:07	Neocraftz1553	and a purple and a cyan/LightBlue
2015-12-28 22:53:14	@Espyo	hm
2015-12-28 22:53:20	Neocraftz1553	Cyans are like sugar high
2015-12-28 22:53:32	Neocraftz1553	but their attack is low
2015-12-28 22:53:39	Neocraftz1553	purples are slow

2015-12-28 22:55:42	@Espyo	...
2015-12-28 22:55:43	@Espyo	how?
2015-12-28 22:57:10	Neocraftz1553	oh
2015-12-28 22:57:33	Neocraftz1553	sry I was playing and grew some purbles
2015-12-28 22:58:06	Neocraftz1553	i crashed it because I dismissed my pikmin and a pikmin went to a pellet and grabbed it
2015-12-28 22:58:44	Neocraftz1553	and tgere wasnt an onion on the map so the pikmin couldnt pathfind to the red onion
2015-12-28 22:59:00	Neocraftz1553	theres only the purble onion
2015-12-28 22:59:22	Neocraftz1553	very simple actually
2015-12-28 23:00:30	Neocraftz1553	heh
2015-12-28 23:00:52	Neocraftz1553	my Yellow Burrow nit is about the size of a red bulborb
2015-12-28 23:02:25	Neocraftz1553	and it throws pikmin rly far
2015-12-28 23:02:31	Neocraftz1553	when it shakes
2015-12-28 23:02:43	Neocraftz1553	theres a simple way to defeat it though
2015-12-28 23:03:02	Neocraftz1553	just swarm it; it can't shake pikmin of if swarmed
2015-12-28 23:03:14	Neocraftz1553	*shake pikmin off
2015-12-28 23:03:54	@Espyo	oh
2015-12-28 23:04:51	Neocraftz1553	probably not that interesting but whatever
2015-12-28 23:05:43	Neocraftz1553	oh and it can sense your pikmin a bit farther away than normal
2015-12-28 23:06:18	Neocraftz1553	and it CAN shake pikmin off when swarmed, but it has a low chance
2015-12-28 23:07:27	Neocraftz1553	so, what are you doing
2015-12-28 23:07:54	@Espyo	hm

2015-12-28 23:10:07	Neocraftz1553	it was a pain designing mushroom pikmin....sorry I'm very random
2015-12-28 23:10:12	Neocraftz1553	but it was
2015-12-28 23:10:22	Neocraftz1553	firat it looked too happy
2015-12-28 23:10:31	Neocraftz1553	then it looked mad
2015-12-28 23:11:13	Neocraftz1553	I was like, "How did nintendo design this mushroom?!?!?"
2015-12-28 23:11:41	Neocraftz1553	then I mad it a "sad" expression and then it looked game-worthy
2015-12-28 23:12:00	Neocraftz1553	then came the small matter of designing the cap...
2015-12-28 23:12:15	Neocraftz1553	so yeah it took a total of 3 hours to make
2015-12-28 23:12:39	Neocraftz1553	I used 2 of those hours to play though, soooo....
2015-12-28 23:13:52	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2015-12-29 20:11:51	Neocraftz1553	either a glitch or something the devs put in
2015-12-29 20:13:19	Neocraftz1553	also, yesterday I learned how to use blender
2015-12-29 20:13:30	@Espyo	nice
2015-12-29 20:13:39	Neocraftz1553	I'm a fast learner
2015-12-29 20:13:52	Neocraftz1553	...I think
2015-12-29 20:14:05	Yoshi2	the next step is learning how to make something in blender
2015-12-29 20:14:24	Neocraftz1553	lol that too
2015-12-29 20:14:28	Yoshi2	and in the end, you cannot get around spending a lot of time on practice
2015-12-29 20:14:44	Neocraftz1553	I made one with textures and stuff
2015-12-29 20:14:58	Neocraftz1553	...that I got from the engine...
2015-12-29 20:15:12	Neocraftz1553	but it did look pretty cool
2015-12-29 20:15:35	Neocraftz1553	but I still can't make something that looks remotely close to a pikmin
2015-12-29 20:15:54	Neocraftz1553	I can onky work with terrain
2015-12-29 20:16:01	Neocraftz1553	*only
2015-12-29 20:17:52	Yoshi2	pikmin, or human, or anything that looks like a living creature, all those are not easy to do

2015-12-29 20:18:10	Neocraftz1553	except  a monkey head

2015-12-29 20:20:49	Neocraftz1553	basically everything is hard to do in blender
2015-12-29 20:20:54	Yoshi2	everything is made of blocks

2015-12-29 20:24:48	@Espyo	that's exactly what he did
2015-12-29 20:24:53	@Espyo	the voting stage ended 2 years ago
2015-12-29 20:25:21	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-29 20:25:23	Yoshi2	nice
2015-12-29 20:25:35	Yoshi2	and the engine is probably a bit more advanced now
2015-12-29 20:25:42	Neocraftz1553	You CAN 'import' sprites
2015-12-29 20:25:53	Neocraftz1553	way more advanced
2015-12-29 20:26:11	@Espyo	*shrug*
2015-12-29 20:26:51	Neocraftz1553	should I tell him? or are you going to tell him, espyo
2015-12-29 20:26:58	Neocraftz1553	about the sprites
2015-12-29 20:27:06	@Espyo	I'm not even sure
2015-12-29 20:27:29	Neocraftz1553	about what
2015-12-29 20:27:43	@Espyo	about the whole thing
2015-12-29 20:27:45	@Espyo	if I should reply or not

2015-12-29 20:27:55	@Espyo	if I should reply about the sprites or not
2015-12-29 20:28:10	@Espyo	I'm not a fan of replying to things that are obvious if people use a minimum amount of research
2015-12-29 20:28:20	@Espyo	like asking a question on a video comment that's already answered in the description
2015-12-29 20:28:29	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-29 20:28:46	Neocraftz1553	yeah it is kinda obvious
2015-12-29 20:29:33	Neocraftz1553	but you need to copy/paste whatever your doing into the same directory, then rename it in both th folder and the text file....
2015-12-29 20:29:55	Neocraftz1553	then you go into the animation editor and change the sprites in the frames...
2015-12-29 20:30:05	Neocraftz1553	at least, thats how I do it
2015-12-29 20:30:13	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-29 20:30:20	@Espyo	well, more or less, yeah
2015-12-29 20:30:21	Neocraftz1553	I'm sure theres an easier way though...
2015-12-29 20:30:38	@Espyo	not really
2015-12-29 20:30:41	@Espyo	that's pretty much it
2015-12-29 20:30:54	Neocraftz1553	oh
2015-12-29 20:31:13	Yoshi2	how much easier than that can it be?
2015-12-29 20:31:22	Neocraftz1553	yeah, and if you want your enemy to be unique, you change the stats
2015-12-29 20:31:29	Neocraftz1553	easier?
2015-12-29 20:31:31	Neocraftz1553	idk
2015-12-29 20:31:44	@Espyo	eh, StarWolf will eventually realize the project is already a go
2015-12-29 20:32:01	Neocraftz1553	for pikmin you have to use the 0 255 255 thingy and change it to the color of your pikmin
2015-12-29 20:32:15	Neocraftz1553	same for captains...
2015-12-29 20:32:24	@Espyo	but that's pretty much it

2015-12-29 20:41:10	Yoshi2	Espyo: I might start writing a program that translates the assembler output of dolphin into slightly more readable assembler/pseudo c
2015-12-29 20:41:33	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-12-29 20:41:38	@Espyo	will it be worth it, though?
2015-12-29 20:41:43	Yoshi2	which might help me with memorizing the assembler instructions
2015-12-29 20:41:44	@Espyo	somebody might've already done that
2015-12-29 20:43:16	Yoshi2	if somebody did that, I cannot find it with 5 minutes of google
2015-12-29 20:43:26	@Espyo	drat
2015-12-29 20:43:56	@Espyo	what about something that translates from GC assembly to "usual" assembly?
2015-12-29 20:44:08	@Espyo	and then from there, there have to be loads of tools to translate to any other language
2015-12-29 20:46:27	Yoshi2	under most circumstances, you can't translate assembly into C again

2015-12-29 20:46:53	@Espyo	of course, but I meant translating into something more readable
2015-12-29 20:47:48	Yoshi2	there aren't that many different instructions, so I'll just write something myself instead of receiving headaches because google can't find what I need
2015-12-29 20:49:04	@Espyo	well, okay
2015-12-29 20:49:06	@Espyo	good luck, then
2015-12-29 20:50:09	Yoshi2	I've done quite a bit of file parsing before, so this shouldn't be too bad

2015-12-29 22:09:26	StarWolf	I think that I've came up with a good way to bring a "nighttime" mode of sorts into my fan-game, but I'd like clarification that it's a good idea.
2015-12-29 22:09:49	@Espyo	hey
2015-12-29 22:09:56	@Espyo	btw, you didn't need to vote on the engine's vote page lol
2015-12-29 22:10:05	@Espyo	that poll was just to know if it was worth it to start the engine
2015-12-29 22:10:10	@Espyo	I've already started it years ago
2015-12-29 22:10:31	@Espyo	either way, you can copy-paste sprites, if they work with the engine
2015-12-29 22:10:35	StarWolf	I saw that when it was a bit to late XD not that I can use it quite yet...
2015-12-29 22:10:40	@Espyo	you can copy-paste existing engine sprites just fine
2015-12-29 22:10:48	@Espyo	but sprites off the internet will only work if they're in a top-down view
2015-12-29 22:10:57	@Espyo	why can't you use it?
2015-12-29 22:12:53	StarWolf	The computer that I use isn't mine, and my computer is too old to really do much XP As for the sprites, I don't really like the top-down view... I kinda wanted a game that looks like earth bound as of style...
2015-12-29 22:13:15	@Espyo	I'm afraid the engine only works top-down
2015-12-29 22:13:36	@Espyo	making it isometric like EarthBound would be a LOT more work
2015-12-29 22:13:44	@Espyo	not just for me, but for the people that make games on the engine as well
2015-12-29 22:13:55	@Espyo	well, you can still try it on your old computer
2015-12-29 22:14:05	@Espyo	I'm worried about performance, so knowing if it runs ok on an old machine would be great
2015-12-29 22:15:21	StarWolf	hmmm... oh well... and my computer is a bit TO old... It can't even run some web-sites like YouTube and FaceBook, and I'm not able to update Safari on it... 
2015-12-29 22:15:35	@Espyo	yikes
2015-12-29 22:15:59	StarWolf	well I got it for free
2015-12-29 22:17:35	StarWolf	anyways, I'd just like to know if my..."way" of implementing nighttime into my fan game is a good idea or not

2015-12-29 22:40:13	@Espyo	heh, nice
2015-12-29 22:40:14	@Espyo	all right
2015-12-29 22:40:19	@Espyo	I might check later
2015-12-29 22:40:27	@Espyo	got this weird bug on the engine that I'm trying to work out
2015-12-29 22:41:23	StarWolf	hmm... what bug? (sorry to pry, I've been interested in programming for a wile now) 
2015-12-29 22:42:00	@Espyo	heh, don't worry about it
2015-12-29 22:42:21	@Espyo	it's crashing when I open an info spot (those text signs you can press the mouse button to get a messagebox of information)
2015-12-29 22:42:36	@Espyo	and on the list of points where the message is meant to break to a new line...
2015-12-29 22:42:57	@Espyo	I must've done something wrong, since it thinks the first point is 4 hundred thousand something, instead of 0
2015-12-29 22:43:04	@Espyo	there might be a rogue -1 somewhere...
2015-12-29 22:43:11	StarWolf	Oh... the crashing part is bad... but the rest went above my head XD 
2015-12-29 22:44:20	@Espyo	too deep, I guess
2015-12-29 22:44:27	@Espyo	well, I'll make it simpler
2015-12-29 22:44:38	@Espyo	when you decrease 1 from 0, it either goes into negatives, or rolls back to a huge number
2015-12-29 22:44:40	@Espyo	my case was just that
2015-12-29 22:44:48	@Espyo	I decreased something somewhere on a 0 where I shouldn't, and boom
2015-12-29 22:45:02	@Espyo	now it's trying to cut a message on the fourth hundredth thousandth character or something
2015-12-29 22:45:24	@Espyo	...ok, this code is a bit sketchy
2015-12-29 22:45:30	@Espyo	but I'm pretty sure that four minus one is three
2015-12-29 22:45:35	@Espyo	even if this code is sketchy
2015-12-29 22:45:38	@Espyo	what in the world is going on |:
2015-12-29 22:46:07	StarWolf	Do you have younger siblings? I know mine like to mess with my stuff...
2015-12-29 22:46:24	@Espyo	oh, I see it
2015-12-29 22:46:33	@Espyo	I do, but she doesn't touch my computer
2015-12-29 22:46:34	@Espyo	she has her own
2015-12-29 22:46:44	@Espyo	plus she's old enough to not go around breaking other people's things
2015-12-29 22:46:59	@Espyo	oh, I did set the first character as one of the break points
2015-12-29 22:47:05	@Espyo	...but for some reason I'm decreasing it
2015-12-29 22:49:27	StarWolf	ummm.... I'm just /slightly/ confused...
2015-12-29 22:49:34	@Espyo	it's fine
2015-12-29 22:49:40	@Espyo	it's hard to get where I'm going at without context
2015-12-29 22:51:29	StarWolf	eh... I shouldn't of gone asking about something that I know nothing of
2015-12-29 22:51:40	@Espyo	don't worry about it
2015-12-29 22:51:50	@Espyo	you said you were interested in programming
2015-12-29 22:51:51	@Espyo	and that's great
2015-12-29 22:51:54	@Espyo	so I just started rambling
2015-12-29 22:53:35	StarWolf	Please don't take offence but something about that reminds me of my math teacher XD
2015-12-29 22:53:43	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-29 22:53:49	@Espyo	well, I wasn't really trying to teach
2015-12-29 22:53:55	@Espyo	I was more focused on getting the problem solved, really
2015-12-29 22:53:59	@Espyo	but don't worry
2015-12-29 22:54:07	@Espyo	you'll have enough headaches as a programmer
2015-12-29 22:54:14	@Espyo	you won't need people's poor instructions to make it worse
2015-12-29 22:54:22	StarWolf	I know, but she sometimes goes over our heads by mistake. 
2015-12-29 22:54:33	@Espyo	there's always that one teacher...
2015-12-29 22:55:09	StarWolf	And I'm sure you're instructions wouldn't be so bad if you were actually trying to teach 
2015-12-29 22:55:15	@Espyo	yep

2015-12-30 21:17:54	Yoshi2	Espyo: if I understand dolphin's assembler/code map output correctly, a function can contain several other functions which are executed in a row, without using jump instructions
2015-12-30 21:17:57	Yoshi2	which does make sense
2015-12-30 21:22:30	Yoshi2	it would explain why, according to the symbol map generated by dolphin, some functions have a size that overflows into other functions
2015-12-30 21:26:58	Yoshi2	well, I shouldn't call them functions anyway because they are indeed just symbols assigned to parts of the code
2015-12-30 21:32:57	@Espyo	inline functions, eh?

2015-12-30 22:00:50	@PikFan	guess he doesn't really care about his userbox much if he took that long
2015-12-30 22:00:57	@PikFan	heh, same here
2015-12-30 22:01:07	@PikFan	still quite interesting
2015-12-30 22:02:12	@PikFan	I bet he wants to add that to Lighting
2015-12-30 22:02:36	@PikFan	oh, also
2015-12-30 22:03:01	@PikFan	you know how you said Splatoon's matchmaking is broken?
2015-12-30 22:03:13	@PikFan	well, now I know what you mean
2015-12-30 22:03:44	@PikFan	because last night I got into a group with FOUR level 50s

2015-12-30 22:08:14	@Espyo	a friend of mine said, 20 minutes ago, that he was the only level 35 in a room of level 7s
2015-12-30 22:08:24	@Espyo	it's incredible how the matchmaking found 7 7s
2015-12-30 22:08:31	@Espyo	...it's horrible how it managed to screw it all up by adding a 35
2015-12-30 22:08:32	@PikFan	wow
2015-12-30 22:08:52	@PikFan	and 35 is a multiple of 7
2015-12-30 22:08:56	@Espyo	heh
2015-12-30 22:09:08	@Espyo	(well... I THINK he's a level 35; he can't be very far off)
2015-12-30 22:09:17	@PikFan	oh, I'm at level 26 now
2015-12-30 22:09:21	@Espyo	...that was fast
2015-12-30 22:10:19	@PikFan	heh, really?
2015-12-30 22:10:27	@Espyo	well, yeah
2015-12-30 22:10:37	@Espyo	I'd expect you to be at level 18 or so by now

2015-12-31 03:13:05	Scruffy	Hello!
2015-12-31 03:13:14	@PikFan	I FINALLY finished Chapter 5!
2015-12-31 03:13:20	Scruffy	Yessss
2015-12-31 03:13:39	Scruffy	Awesome!
2015-12-31 03:13:44	@PikFan	yeah
2015-12-31 03:13:51	@PikFan	hold on a sec, I'm playing Splatoon
2015-12-31 03:13:54	@PikFan	back in 3 minutes
2015-12-31 03:14:17	Scruffy	Ok

2015-12-31 03:17:12	Scruffy	hi
2015-12-31 03:17:13	@PikFan	but yeah, I finally got it done
2015-12-31 03:17:25	@PikFan	I met my goal of getting it done before New Year's
2015-12-31 03:17:27	Scruffy	So how does it turn out with the snagret reinforcements?/
2015-12-31 03:17:29	Scruffy	Nice
2015-12-31 03:17:45	@PikFan	well, why don't you read it for yourself and find out?
2015-12-31 03:17:49	Scruffy	:D
2015-12-31 03:17:56	@PikFan	https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11327644/6/Pikmin-Mysterious-World

2015-12-31 03:24:02	Scruffy	hang on a sec, brb
2015-12-31 03:24:07	@PikFan	okay
2015-12-31 03:24:08	Scruffy	This is really good
2015-12-31 03:24:15	@PikFan	yay, thanks
2015-12-31 03:28:50	Scruffy	That's great
2015-12-31 03:28:58	Scruffy	I love the language in this one
2015-12-31 03:29:05	Scruffy	Very colorful
2015-12-31 03:29:15	@PikFan	well, of course
2015-12-31 03:29:16	Scruffy	And I didn't expect the Snagrets to have healing powers
2015-12-31 03:29:26	Scruffy	But there's more to them than meets the eye
2015-12-31 03:29:27	@PikFan	you suggested it, remember?
2015-12-31 03:29:39	@PikFan	I decided to go with your idea
2015-12-31 03:29:50	@PikFan	otherwise, Ruby's attack would've finished it off
2015-12-31 03:30:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-31 03:30:11	Scruffy	Cool!
2015-12-31 03:30:12	@PikFan	I had to have a logical reason why the Tree Snagret survived her attack
2015-12-31 03:30:14	@PikFan	thanjs
2015-12-31 03:30:16	@PikFan	*thanks
2015-12-31 03:31:44	@PikFan	it's even longer than Chapter 4
2015-12-31 03:32:28	@PikFan	3,793 words
2015-12-31 03:32:43	@PikFan	quite lengthy
2015-12-31 03:33:44	Scruffy	Yeah
2015-12-31 03:34:09	@PikFan	how was the pacing?
2015-12-31 03:34:14	Scruffy	Also I like how Ruby exclaims the name of the attack
2015-12-31 03:34:20	Scruffy	THe pace was engaging
2015-12-31 03:34:23	Scruffy	I liked it
2015-12-31 03:34:30	@PikFan	ok, good
2015-12-31 03:34:35	@PikFan	and yeah
2015-12-31 03:35:06	@PikFan	it was based off a special attack called a "Mystic Arte"
2015-12-31 03:35:15	@PikFan	which appears in the Tales Series
2015-12-31 03:35:42	Scruffy	Ah, hehe

2015-12-31 03:35:48	Scruffy	neat*
2015-12-31 03:36:52	@PikFan	my personal favorite Mystic Arte is one called Indignation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtCiP8B2xpc
2015-12-31 03:40:36	@PikFan	hopefully, I'll get some reviews on fanfiction.net
2015-12-31 03:41:35	Scruffy	Wow

2015-12-31 03:42:04	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-12-31 03:42:06	@PikFan	good idea
2015-12-31 03:42:09	@PikFan	I'd love to see it
2015-12-31 03:46:54	Scruffy	Here's what I have so far
2015-12-31 03:47:09	Scruffy	It's not much, there's a lot more I want to cover in this chapter
2015-12-31 03:47:10	Scruffy	http://pastebin.com/rfHY6sAE

2015-12-31 03:55:34	@PikFan	I like the backstory behind Olimar

2015-12-31 22:06:11	@Espyo	but on the image you sent... can't you zoom in a bit more so people can see it better?
2015-12-31 22:06:29	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-31 22:07:00	Neocraftz1553	that is what I tried to do, but it didn't get the wanted results.
2015-12-31 22:07:08	Neocraftz1553	I'll try to adjust it
2015-12-31 22:07:13	@Espyo	how so? what happened?
2015-12-31 22:07:38	Neocraftz1553	It looked way too blurry
2015-12-31 22:08:13	Neocraftz1553	I'll try to retake it right now
2015-12-31 22:08:25	@Espyo	weird
2015-12-31 22:09:47	Neocraftz1553	its not the engines fault
2015-12-31 22:10:28	Neocraftz1553	you should add a checkbox to not show the grid when in the review
2015-12-31 22:10:54	@Espyo	isn't the grid behind the image though?
2015-12-31 22:11:36	Neocraftz1553	yeah, but I want it to look like a pikmin map, you know, without the grid
2015-12-31 22:11:43	@Espyo	hmm
2015-12-31 22:11:50	@Espyo	well, you can always edit it manually
2015-12-31 22:11:56	@Espyo	but sure, I can make it so that the grid doesn't appear on the review
2015-12-31 22:12:00	Neocraftz1553	It's because I use the cheapest method to get the image...
2015-12-31 22:12:16	Neocraftz1553	I record it then take a snapshot on vlc XD
2015-12-31 22:12:30	@Espyo	that
2015-12-31 22:12:37	@Espyo	is probably the worst way, dude |:
2015-12-31 22:12:47	@Espyo	you can press the print screen key, open paint, and paste it there
2015-12-31 22:12:50	Neocraftz1553	yes I know
2015-12-31 22:13:03	@Espyo	and I THINK that there is a keyboard shortcut to take a screenshot and automatically save it somewhere
2015-12-31 22:13:03	En_Passant	ew, paint
2015-12-31 22:13:10	Neocraftz1553	lol
2015-12-31 22:13:14	@Espyo	yeah, it's horrible
2015-12-31 22:13:19	Neocraftz1553	there is a shortcut?
2015-12-31 22:13:21	@Espyo	but if you don't have any other editing program, it has to do
2015-12-31 22:13:29	@Espyo	I think it's something like the windows key + print screen
2015-12-31 22:14:03	En_Passant	Probably the Fn key
2015-12-31 22:14:23	@Espyo	no, the Fn key only allows you to press keys that are labeled differently on your keyboard
2015-12-31 22:14:25	@Espyo	and depends on the laptops
2015-12-31 22:14:45	Neocraftz1553	yes ik about Fn
2015-12-31 22:14:53	Neocraftz1553	thanks to blender
2015-12-31 22:15:51	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2015-12-31 22:16:12	Neocraftz1553	but it captured my entirw screen
2015-12-31 22:16:16	Neocraftz1553	entire
2015-12-31 22:16:23	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-12-31 22:16:27	@Espyo	you can hold alt to force it to capture only your window
2015-12-31 22:16:30	@Espyo	but either way, done now
2015-12-31 22:16:37	En_Passant	Wait, really?
2015-12-31 22:16:42	En_Passant	Did not know
2015-12-31 22:16:44	Neocraftz1553	?
2015-12-31 22:16:45	@Espyo	checking the "See textures" box also hides the grid
2015-12-31 22:16:49	@Espyo	yeah, it works
2015-12-31 22:16:51	En_Passant	I just use the Snipping Tool
2015-12-31 22:16:57	@Espyo	I'm 99% sure it's Alt
2015-12-31 22:17:02	@Espyo	if it's not Alt... it's Shift
2015-12-31 22:17:05	@Espyo	...but it has to be Alt
2015-12-31 22:17:07	Neocraftz1553	no it dowsnt
2015-12-31 22:17:10	Neocraftz1553	hide the grid
2015-12-31 22:17:17	@Espyo	I mean I changed it to make it so
2015-12-31 22:17:23	@Espyo	it hides NOW, as in it hides on my build
2015-12-31 22:17:31	Neocraftz1553	oh
2015-12-31 22:21:54	Neocraftz1553	oh espyo
2015-12-31 22:22:02	Neocraftz1553	about the engine
2015-12-31 22:22:05	@Espyo	yeah?
2015-12-31 22:22:33	Neocraftz1553	are new pikmin that come out of onions going to be leaf? or still flowered
2015-12-31 22:22:39	@Espyo	leaf
2015-12-31 22:22:45	@Espyo	yeah, I noticed that today too, actually
2015-12-31 22:22:45	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-31 22:22:47	@Espyo	they come out as flowers
2015-12-31 22:22:51	@Espyo	but should come out as leaves
2015-12-31 22:22:55	@Espyo	I won't fix that now
2015-12-31 22:23:00	@Espyo	it's not as important
2015-12-31 22:23:02	@Espyo	but I'll fix it eventually
2015-12-31 22:23:12	Neocraftz1553	also
2015-12-31 22:23:22	Neocraftz1553	are there pikmin paths?
2015-12-31 22:23:35	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2015-12-31 22:23:38	@Espyo	the carrying paths?
2015-12-31 22:23:39	Neocraftz1553	pathfinding
2015-12-31 22:23:42	Neocraftz1553	yes
2015-12-31 22:23:52	@Espyo	well no, we discussed this before
2015-12-31 22:23:58	Neocraftz1553	oh
2015-12-31 22:24:00	@Espyo	it'll be the next thing I'll work on
2015-12-31 22:24:01	Neocraftz1553	oh yeah
2015-12-31 22:24:07	@Espyo	yep
2015-12-31 22:24:30	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-31 22:24:54	Neocraftz1553	how hard do you think it will be to program it into the editor
2015-12-31 22:25:39	@Espyo	might take me two weeks, if I'm really going at it
2015-12-31 22:25:58	Neocraftz1553	oh and uh, a quick question about the spectralid
2015-12-31 22:25:59	@Espyo	wait, to the editor?
2015-12-31 22:26:03	@Espyo	around 5 hours to the editor
2015-12-31 22:26:06	@Espyo	sure
2015-12-31 22:26:43	Yoshi2	(multiply it by 3 or 4 if there are unexpected issues)
2015-12-31 22:27:14	@Espyo	yeeeeeep
2015-12-31 22:27:27	Neocraftz1553	how do they work? can pikmin swarm them from the bottem, do they "fly" over your pikmim and you have to throw them at them...
2015-12-31 22:27:37	Neocraftz1553	sorry the questions kinda lobg
2015-12-31 22:27:38	Neocraftz1553	long
2015-12-31 22:27:46	@Espyo	heh, no biggie
2015-12-31 22:27:50	@Espyo	yeah, it flies over the Pikmin
2015-12-31 22:27:53	@Espyo	it flies randomly for a few seconds
2015-12-31 22:27:55	@Espyo	then lands to rest
2015-12-31 22:27:57	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-31 22:28:03	@Espyo	if there are Pikmin or leaders nearby, it won't rest for long
2015-12-31 22:28:07	@Espyo	but if not, it'll rest for a few seconds
2015-12-31 22:28:09	Neocraftz1553	so they can't attack it if you swarm
2015-12-31 22:28:17	@Espyo	you can swarm if it's on the ground
2015-12-31 22:28:17	Neocraftz1553	ok
2015-12-31 22:28:19	@Espyo	but otherwise, you have to throw
2015-12-31 22:28:29	@Espyo	it's working quite well, except for one thing that I didn't have time to tweak
2015-12-31 22:28:38	@Espyo	when it decides to fly, it just teleports into the air
2015-12-31 22:28:42	@Espyo	instead of going up smoothly
2015-12-31 22:28:46	@Espyo	I'll fix it on a later date...
2015-12-31 22:28:54	Neocraftz1553	heh, not a problem
2015-12-31 22:29:18	Neocraftz1553	although it might take a few more grames to make it go up smoothly...
2015-12-31 22:29:31	Neocraftz1553	*frames
2015-12-31 22:30:24	@Espyo	yeah
2015-12-31 22:31:49	Neocraftz1553	I'm not feeling like making the image clearer today though.... I kinda just want to finish the other maps... so.. yeah
2015-12-31 22:31:55	@Espyo	all right
2015-12-31 22:32:34	Neocraftz1553	I might make it clearer tommarrow... and if scruffy finishes the previews... maybe.... idk
2015-12-31 22:33:18	Neocraftz1553	yeah im just tweaking a red pikmin in blender... making him into odd shapes and stuff
2015-12-31 22:33:20	Neocraftz1553	just for fun
2015-12-31 22:34:35	@Espyo	hehe
2015-12-31 22:35:11	Neocraftz1553	some actually freaked me out though... nightmare fuel
2015-12-31 22:39:57	Yoshi2	hm, I should implement binary search in the function that retrieves the symbol name an address belongs to
2015-12-31 22:40:39	Neocraftz1553	?... for what
2015-12-31 22:42:12	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: if you have an ordered list of numbers, binary search can be used to find the position of a specific number much more quickly as its performance scales much better when the amount of numbers increases
2015-12-31 22:43:25	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2015-12-31 22:43:46	Neocraftz1553	that reminds me, I have tp decipher a binary code I found
2015-12-31 22:43:47	@Espyo	yes, probably better now than later

2015-12-31 22:48:25	StarWolf	I was wondering.... Scruffy is making music for his fan game, and I wanted to add some of my own. How ever I can't make any... Am I allowed to use pre-existing tracks from other irl games?

2015-12-31 22:50:01	Neocraftz1553	but you know, nintendo copyroghts and such, so it is recommended you make your own
2015-12-31 22:50:32	Neocraftz1553	other company's, well, idk how heavily they enforce their copyrights
2015-12-31 22:51:27	Neocraftz1553	you can request music from scruffy though, just try to give as much detail as possible to him...
2015-12-31 22:51:43	StarWolf	Well, idk of any music making programs that are free, and I'd ask Scruffy if he could make a few tracks but... 
2015-12-31 22:51:50	Neocraftz1553	another way is getting some programs/apps to do it
2015-12-31 22:52:02	Neocraftz1553	oh free music programs
2015-12-31 22:52:14	Neocraftz1553	yes, yes, of course
2015-12-31 22:52:30	Neocraftz1553	let me find some...
2015-12-31 22:52:39	StarWolf	thanks!
2015-12-31 22:53:17	Neocraftz1553	found a list
2015-12-31 22:53:42	Neocraftz1553	I didn't review it though, but there are 20 recommended software
2015-12-31 22:53:59	Yoshi2	considering that reusing music in your fangame basically means you are redistributing that music, you could get in trouble

2015-12-31 22:57:17	Neocraftz1553	hydrogen is a program that is recommended if you want to add drums and stuff...
2015-12-31 22:57:20	Yoshi2	I don't think pikmin fanon is much of a music hoster, so you'd probably need to host the music somewhere else
2015-12-31 22:57:32	Yoshi2	e.g. soundcloud 
2015-12-31 22:57:33	Neocraftz1553	heh yeah
2015-12-31 22:57:42	Neocraftz1553	or youtube and such
2015-12-31 22:57:54	Neocraftz1553	there are other ways as well

2015-12-31 23:31:21	@PikFan	hi
2015-12-31 23:31:27	Yoshi2	hiho pikfan
2015-12-31 23:31:33	@PikFan	happy new year, everyone!
2015-12-31 23:32:09	@PikFan	is it 2016 for any of you guys yet?
2015-12-31 23:32:12	Yoshi2	new year's eve, when else would you be allowed to make an entire country look like a civil war was going on
2015-12-31 23:32:13	@Espyo	hi
2015-12-31 23:32:26	@Espyo	I think it is for Yoshi2
2015-12-31 23:32:43	@PikFan	Independence Day for the US
2015-12-31 23:33:04	Yoshi2	Espyo: yup
2015-12-31 23:33:52	@PikFan	I'm still over 8 hours away
2015-12-31 23:34:26	@PikFan	but man, 2015 has gone by so fast...
2015-12-31 23:34:39	@Espyo	odd, I feel the opposite
2015-12-31 23:34:54	@PikFan	heh, why?
2015-12-31 23:35:19	@Espyo	dunno, it feels like I've been living on 2015 forever now
2015-12-31 23:35:32	@Espyo	when you have to get the current year from he repository in your mind
2015-12-31 23:35:45	@Espyo	it feels like I've been fetching "2015" a lot more than any other year
2015-12-31 23:36:05	@PikFan	oh, I had an idea
2015-12-31 23:36:16	@PikFan	but it's too late to implement it
2015-12-31 23:37:09	@PikFan	but anyway, my idea is that you could put in a new year's countdown in Testyo
2015-12-31 23:37:09	Testyo	by which I have to start being aggressive with the answers
2015-12-31 23:37:24	@PikFan	not every second, of course

2015-12-31 23:38:24	@PikFan	maybe like in intervals of 10 seconds, and then intervals of 1 second for the last 5
2015-12-31 23:38:32	Yoshi2	could probably make several countdowns for different countries in the world
2015-12-31 23:38:51	@PikFan	but we can't
2015-12-31 23:39:05	@PikFan	Espyo would have to stay up all night
2015-12-31 23:39:19	@PikFan	Testyo's only on when Espyo's on
2015-12-31 23:39:20	Testyo	how hot WHOLE new level
2015-12-31 23:39:20	Yoshi2	he already stays up all night
2015-12-31 23:39:33	@PikFan	...he does?
2015-12-31 23:39:54	@PikFan	even so, I can't imagine him staying up till 8 am
2015-12-31 23:40:07	@PikFan	which is midnight for me
2015-12-31 23:40:49	Yoshi2	it will be fine if half the world gets it :>
2015-12-31 23:41:15	@PikFan	heh
2015-12-31 23:41:43	@PikFan	so what do you think, Espyo? we could do this for next year

2015-12-31 23:45:19	@PikFan	if we even remember
2015-12-31 23:45:35	@PikFan	but wait, Testyo has an alarm
2015-12-31 23:45:36	Testyo	took me far too long to work out I can make it less dark by turning the page be?
2015-12-31 23:45:46	@PikFan	...uh
2015-12-31 23:46:17	@PikFan	I forgot how to set the alarm
2015-12-31 23:46:38	Yoshi2	burning my thumb is a great way to start the new year though
2015-12-31 23:46:56	@PikFan	ouch, how'd you do that?
2015-12-31 23:48:05	Yoshi2	a combination of me not having the correct lighter and the spark being much bigger than expected
2015-12-31 23:48:28	@PikFan	hm
2015-12-31 23:48:29	Yoshi2	-> rip thumb
2015-12-31 23:48:40	@PikFan	well that sucks
2015-12-31 23:49:09	@PikFan	wait, why'd you need a lighter? for lighting fireworks?
2015-12-31 23:49:21	Yoshi2	now my thumb is permanently submerged in water until the pain goes away
2015-12-31 23:49:39	Yoshi2	yes
2015-12-31 23:49:46	@PikFan	ah
2015-12-31 23:49:57	Yoshi2	and various crackers

2016-01-01 00:03:24	Yoshi2	Espyo: fun fact: conditional branches are not used to jump into different functions/routines than the current one
2016-01-01 00:04:22	Yoshi2	actually, nevermind
2016-01-01 00:04:27	Yoshi2	my code does not confirm that
2016-01-01 00:07:54	Yoshi2	but I'm pretty sure that for the most part, only 3 instructions are used for jumping into other functions

2016-01-01 00:23:30	Yoshi2	conditional jumps between different symbol groups are possible, but those are usually not far away
2016-01-01 00:24:25	Yoshi2	there are maybe a handful of such cases, so it is not the preferred way of jumping into functions

2016-01-01 16:22:32	Scruffy	Wait a sec
2016-01-01 16:22:40	Scruffy	Ohhhh, but the 3ds was the one that works
2016-01-01 16:22:48	@Espyo	oh, 3ds it is then
2016-01-01 16:22:55	Scruffy	Cool, thank you
2016-01-01 16:23:24	Scruffy	Yeah, this user that just started on Pikipedia, Pikminfan27, has been dogging me for Blender renders of these leaders
2016-01-01 16:23:34	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-01 16:23:39	@Espyo	oh... yikes... the leader models
2016-01-01 16:23:49	@Espyo	see, Pikmin 3 has all leaders and Pikmin jumbled up in the same model
2016-01-01 16:24:03	Scruffy	Woah
2016-01-01 16:24:08	@Espyo	they're sorted by... I don't know what this is called, but I'd go with "bodies", so I can just disable all bodies but the ones I want
2016-01-01 16:24:11	@Espyo	...or so I COULD
2016-01-01 16:24:15	@Espyo	IF 3DS MAX WAS A GOOD PIECE OF SOFTWARE
2016-01-01 16:24:22	Scruffy	That's okay, I can do it in Blender
2016-01-01 16:24:23	@Espyo	there is a button to disable them and make them invisible
2016-01-01 16:24:25	@Espyo	but it doesn't WORK
2016-01-01 16:24:39	@Espyo	not sure if the information of the "bodies" will go through the .3ds
2016-01-01 16:24:42	@Espyo	but it's worth a shot
2016-01-01 16:24:50	Scruffy	Man, I'm sorry to ask this of you so often
2016-01-01 16:25:07	@Espyo	often? don't be silly
2016-01-01 16:25:09	@Espyo	my pleasure to help
2016-01-01 16:25:16	@Espyo	the only part that's not my pleasure is having work with this program
2016-01-01 16:25:19	@Espyo	but that's not your fault
2016-01-01 16:25:21	@Espyo	so no sorries to be had
2016-01-01 16:25:33	@Espyo	plus, most of the problem is waiting
2016-01-01 16:25:37	@Espyo	 9 minutes... eesh
2016-01-01 16:25:42	@Espyo	but I can just do something else while I wait
2016-01-01 16:25:43	@Espyo	so meh

2016-01-01 16:29:06	@Espyo	as for textures, I can't remember: do you use .dds?
2016-01-01 16:29:10	@Espyo	or do you want them in .png?
2016-01-01 16:29:31	Scruffy	png, if you can
2016-01-01 16:30:00	@Espyo	I have to convert to png manually
2016-01-01 16:30:06	@Espyo	XNView is great; I can batch convert it
2016-01-01 16:30:17	@Espyo	but if it works with dds just fine, maybe it'd be less trouble
2016-01-01 16:30:23	@Espyo	unless you plan on editing the textures and need png anyway
2016-01-01 16:30:28	@Espyo	in that case I might as well convert them here now
2016-01-01 16:30:33	Scruffy	No no, I can try it with dds
2016-01-01 16:30:48	Scruffy	I'm not going to edit them
2016-01-01 16:30:56	@Espyo	ok
2016-01-01 16:31:01	@Espyo	let me know if it doesn't work, and I'll convert them
2016-01-01 16:31:09	Scruffy	Thank you
2016-01-01 16:40:00	@Espyo	oh, 4MB
2016-01-01 16:40:04	@Espyo	I thought it was going to be like 30
2016-01-01 16:40:23	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/player.zip
2016-01-01 16:40:25	@Espyo	let's see if this works
2016-01-01 16:44:16	@Espyo	I like how visual studio is complaining that this value won't fit this variable
2016-01-01 16:44:22	@Espyo	even though the value was created by them to fit the variable
2016-01-01 16:44:32	@Espyo	FLT_MAX is the maxmimum value a float can take
2016-01-01 16:44:37	@Espyo	...but apparently doesn't fit inside a float
2016-01-01 16:45:14	@Espyo	...wow
2016-01-01 16:45:22	@Espyo	I tried typing "- 1" to it
2016-01-01 16:45:23	@Espyo	it crashed
2016-01-01 16:45:29	@Espyo	this is like a comedy sketch
2016-01-01 16:46:22	Scruffy	Ah, yes, dds works
2016-01-01 16:46:51	@Espyo	what about the model?
2016-01-01 16:46:56	@Espyo	can you split all of the different characters?
2016-01-01 16:46:58	Scruffy	I can separate them all
2016-01-01 16:47:00	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-01 16:47:01	@Espyo	ah, good
2016-01-01 16:47:11	@Espyo	well, A B and C are the Koppaites
2016-01-01 16:47:18	@Espyo	no bonus points for guessing which letter stands for which leader
2016-01-01 16:47:24	@Espyo	D is Louie, E is Olimar
2016-01-01 16:47:28	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-01 16:47:39	Scruffy	And there are all the canonical types of pIkmin 3 pikmin
2016-01-01 16:47:42	Scruffy	Plus...
2016-01-01 16:47:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-01 16:47:51	Scruffy	a higher poly pikpik carrot and bulbmin
2016-01-01 16:47:58	@Espyo	yeah, noted
2016-01-01 16:48:02	@Espyo	will add to TCRF at one point
2016-01-01 16:48:06	@Espyo	crazy stuff, I love it
2016-01-01 16:48:13	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-01 16:48:13	@Espyo	oh, I should've taken the chance to send Pikmin textures your way
2016-01-01 16:48:20	@Espyo	you don't have the P3 models/textures for Pikmin, do you?
2016-01-01 16:48:27	@Espyo	(...well, you have the models now :V)
2016-01-01 16:49:20	Scruffy	I didn't have them before, no
2016-01-01 16:49:33	Scruffy	I thought Pikmin were just solid colors though
2016-01-01 16:49:41	@Espyo	not really
2016-01-01 16:49:44	@Espyo	not in Pikmin 3 at least
2016-01-01 16:49:45	Scruffy	Well, I guess in PIkmin 3 there was extra detail
2016-01-01 16:49:53	@Espyo	their colors gradually change on their stem
2016-01-01 16:49:58	@Espyo	I'll send you the textures too, then
2016-01-01 16:50:07	@Espyo	I'm surprised people haven't requested renders including Pikmin yet
2016-01-01 16:50:35	Scruffy	Plenty of people had
2016-01-01 16:50:48	Scruffy	But I could only use trophy models from Brawl, that's all I had
2016-01-01 16:51:21	@Espyo	that won't do
2016-01-01 16:51:25	@Espyo	you're upgrading, and you're doing it now
2016-01-01 16:51:32	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-01-01 16:51:48	Scruffy	Actually, just a few days ago I created a fully rigged skeleton of a Red Pikmin
2016-01-01 16:51:53	Scruffy	for posing and animating
2016-01-01 16:52:14	Scruffy	I've posted it on the Pikipedia forums but I'm planning to make a video showing what it can do
2016-01-01 16:52:26	@Espyo	nice, nice
2016-01-01 16:53:11	@Espyo	does Blender give you the names of each character on that pile of models I sent you?
2016-01-01 16:53:15	@Espyo	they're identified on 3DS Max
2016-01-01 16:53:22	@Espyo	I don't know if that information got through with the export
2016-01-01 16:53:31	@Espyo	if it didn't, then me saying "A B and C are the leaders" and so on won't make any sense to you
2016-01-01 16:53:45	Scruffy	Yes, they are named
2016-01-01 16:54:03	Scruffy	Blue PIkmin is DUMMY.piki_p3_bl
2016-01-01 16:54:20	@Espyo	seems about right
2016-01-01 16:54:36	Scruffy	the two letters at the end appear to be abbreviations for color, but some don't add up
2016-01-01 16:54:54	Scruffy	Rock Pikmin are "gr", which is probably green, and Winged are "or"
2016-01-01 16:55:03	@Espyo	gray
2016-01-01 16:55:05	@Espyo	for Rocks
2016-01-01 16:55:08	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-01 16:55:10	@Espyo	and yeah, Wingeds are internally called orange
2016-01-01 16:55:11	Scruffy	I'm so dumb
2016-01-01 16:55:14	@Espyo	lol
2016-01-01 16:55:26	Scruffy	and the pikpik carrot is called "ninji"
2016-01-01 16:55:35	@Espyo	Japanese for carrot, I believe
2016-01-01 16:55:39	@Espyo	I know I checked that at the time
2016-01-01 16:56:00	Scruffy	I've also realized the helmets in all the games are actually two spheres
2016-01-01 16:56:06	@Espyo	oh?
2016-01-01 16:56:10	Scruffy	To make the helmet look like it has thickness
2016-01-01 16:56:18	@Espyo	that's actually quite genius

2016-01-01 16:56:27	@Espyo	add it, please :)
2016-01-01 16:56:29	Scruffy	well, in Smash and Pikmin 3 anyway
2016-01-01 16:56:33	Scruffy	no problem :)
2016-01-01 16:57:02	@Espyo	I mean, it's obvious in hindsight
2016-01-01 16:57:10	@Espyo	but I don't see it as something people would think about unless they're told
2016-01-01 16:57:17	@Espyo	so it's good for a "huh. oh yeah." moment for readers
2016-01-01 16:57:25	@Espyo	anyway, textures done: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/piki_textures.zip
2016-01-01 16:58:31	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-01-01 16:58:37	@Espyo	no problem

2016-01-01 16:59:21	Scruffy	Ahhh that's right, of course
2016-01-01 16:59:34	Scruffy	These Pikmin need new textures because the Wii U does bump mapping
2016-01-01 17:00:10	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-01 17:00:22	@Espyo	all things considered, the textures aren't very high res
2016-01-01 17:00:24	@Espyo	except for the buds
2016-01-01 17:00:28	@Espyo	those textures are huge, for some reason
2016-01-01 17:00:40	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-01 17:02:27	Scruffy	one thing that disappointed me that I feel the Wii U could have handled was plant translucency
2016-01-01 17:02:48	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-01-01 17:02:57	Scruffy	Leaves are not opaque, when you through them at a light source they let light through and shadows
2016-01-01 17:03:04	@Espyo	don't some plants become translucent if they're in the way of the camera?
2016-01-01 17:03:07	@Espyo	I know that's not what you mean
2016-01-01 17:03:18	Scruffy	Actually not in Pikmin 3
2016-01-01 17:03:27	Scruffy	Or in any of the Pikmin games
2016-01-01 17:03:29	Scruffy	I've notcied
2016-01-01 17:03:42	@Espyo	hm, all right
2016-01-01 17:03:47	Scruffy	if something's in the way of you, the camera orbits up until it can see all of you
2016-01-01 17:03:54	@Espyo	but yeah, maybe that's one of those things where it's obvious in hindsight
2016-01-01 17:04:11	@Espyo	if you were to go up to a dev now and tell them that, they'd be like "oh yeah, we never thought of that. quickly, let's add it to Pikmin 4"
2016-01-01 17:04:23	@Espyo	[[Camera]]
2016-01-01 17:04:23	Testyo	"Camera" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Camera
2016-01-01 17:04:26	@Espyo	probably worth adding there ^
2016-01-01 17:04:29	@Espyo	that article's a bit barebone
2016-01-01 17:05:47	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-01 17:06:00	Scruffy	Another thing is that P1 and P2 always focused the camera on the leader
2016-01-01 17:06:19	Scruffy	while P3 always tries to get the leader and all the leaders' Pikmin in the shot
2016-01-01 17:06:41	@Espyo	ah, I noticed that
2016-01-01 17:06:42	Scruffy	so sometimes you'll be walking near the edge of the screen when the camera tries to get the line of Pikmin behind you
2016-01-01 17:06:48	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-01 17:07:34	@Espyo	>In Pikmin and Pikmin 2, the camera is always centered on the current leader, to allow a consistent field of vision. In Pikmin 3, Pikmin follow the leaders in a narrow line, and the camera always attempts to center itself so it can capture all of the line. This way, the maximum amount of Pikmin are always visible, but this can mean the leaders' view ahead is sometimes obscured.
2016-01-01 17:07:36	@Espyo	it's written here
2016-01-01 17:07:41	@Espyo	but what the hell was I thinking when I wrote that?
2016-01-01 17:07:42	@Espyo	it makes no sense
2016-01-01 17:08:56	Scruffy	I have a memory of writing that actually, but I don't know if that's true
2016-01-01 17:09:05	@Espyo	you wrote that?
2016-01-01 17:09:08	@Espyo	I don't even know any more
2016-01-01 17:09:16	@Espyo	oh wait
2016-01-01 17:09:18	@Espyo	I'm reading again
2016-01-01 17:09:19	@Espyo	it does make sense
2016-01-01 17:09:30	@Espyo	I read it as "the camera follows the leaders in a narrow line"
2016-01-01 17:09:33	@Espyo	I was like "what even?"
2016-01-01 17:09:40	Scruffy	heh
2016-01-01 17:10:15	Scruffy	Oh, woah!
2016-01-01 17:10:31	Scruffy	The Pikmin's eyes are actually connected to their heads in Pikmin 3!
2016-01-01 17:10:45	@Espyo	oh!
2016-01-01 17:12:29	Scruffy	It's such a minor thing, but I guess since you can get a closeup of Pikmin with the camera, they had to do that
2016-01-01 17:12:42	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-01 17:16:55	Scruffy	Pretty soon I think I'll share some .blend files and obj and things

2016-01-01 18:10:16	@J	well, back to work on Monday
2016-01-01 18:11:37	@Espyo	yeeeeeep.
2016-01-01 18:19:28	@J	someone rotated all the Dustforce maps by 90 degrees, so I was playing that
2016-01-01 18:19:29	Testyo	90 degrees = 1.5708 rad
2016-01-01 18:20:00	Yoshi2	Testyo: thank you
2016-01-01 18:20:01	Testyo	so keeping the render distance so, were they reverted?
2016-01-01 18:20:33	@Espyo	that... actually seems fun
2016-01-01 18:20:48	@Espyo	Yoshi2: Testyo's just helping those people that live in countries where they use radians
2016-01-01 18:20:49	Testyo	like "wow, I could do this and that to reproduce that into the RC
2016-01-01 18:20:51	@Espyo	which is NO country
2016-01-01 18:22:42	Yoshi2	Espyo: yup
2016-01-01 18:22:44	@J	yeah, so the fall/climb and horizontal parts get reversed

2016-01-01 23:33:44	@PikFan	happy 2016!
2016-01-01 23:34:11	ScruffyChat	Happy new year!

2016-01-01 23:34:26	@Espyo	happy new year!
2016-01-01 23:34:56	@PikFan	so I'm not sure how many of you guys noticed, but I updated Fanon's sitenotice and featured content
2016-01-01 23:35:04	@PikFan	and so we need a new poll
2016-01-01 23:35:35	@PikFan	I had a basic idea for a poll, and it's "How excited are you for Pikmin 4?"
2016-01-01 23:35:59	@PikFan	...I should've done this yesterday, when it was still December, but oh well
2016-01-01 23:36:24	@PikFan	and wow, Espyo, nice job on the engine article
2016-01-01 23:36:31	ScruffyChat	Yeah, very detailed
2016-01-01 23:36:33	@PikFan	and subpages too, wow
2016-01-01 23:36:41	ScruffyChat	And the latest engine is awesome
2016-01-01 23:37:42	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-01-01 23:37:54	@Espyo	oh, I did notice the sitenotice
2016-01-01 23:38:01	@Espyo	but I thought that that was because I was logged out, and then logged in
2016-01-01 23:38:06	@Espyo	on that note, check if the anonnotice is updated too
2016-01-01 23:38:14	@PikFan	yeah, it is
2016-01-01 23:38:21	@PikFan	the sitenotice is the same for everyone
2016-01-01 23:38:31	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-01 23:38:34	@PikFan	I don't think there's a separate anonnotice
2016-01-01 23:38:55	@PikFan	oh, there is

2016-01-01 23:41:32	ScruffyChat	Oh, also, should  everything I've made on Fanon go in the 3d rendered images category?
2016-01-01 23:41:47	@PikFan	pretty much, yeah
2016-01-01 23:42:09	@PikFan	I know that Neocraftz guy made a 3D render too
2016-01-01 23:42:23	@PikFan	so this is a category for anyone who makes 3D renders
2016-01-01 23:43:17	ScruffyChat	Ok, cool!
2016-01-01 23:44:14	@PikFan	guh, this deletion policy thing is breaking my brain

2016-01-02 00:58:41	@Espyo	like 3 minutes
2016-01-02 00:58:50	@PikFan	oh, ok
2016-01-02 00:58:54	@PikFan	hmm
2016-01-02 00:59:13	@PikFan	I still want to make the responses better, but... I can't think of anything better
2016-01-02 00:59:18	@PikFan	how about you guys?
2016-01-02 00:59:23	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-02 00:59:49	ScruffyChat	I'm guessing you've already asked favorite Pikmin type before?
2016-01-02 01:00:43	@PikFan	uh
2016-01-02 01:00:47	@PikFan	let me check
2016-01-02 01:01:51	@PikFan	oh, nope
2016-01-02 01:01:57	@PikFan	no favorite Pikmin type
2016-01-02 01:02:20	@PikFan	wait, do you mean canon or fanon? or both?
2016-01-02 01:02:28	ScruffyChat	Umm
2016-01-02 01:02:31	@Espyo	it seems like it's just a simple poll in essence
2016-01-02 01:02:41	ScruffyChat	Well I thought canon when I thought of it

2016-01-02 01:03:00	@PikFan	I feel like a fanon Pikmin type would be more appropriate, but...
2016-01-02 01:03:14	@PikFan	I suppose we could do canon
2016-01-02 01:03:23	@PikFan	Espyo: what do you mean?
2016-01-02 01:06:55	@Espyo	well
2016-01-02 01:07:12	@Espyo	polls on Pikipedia, in general, attempt to learn something tangible about the community 
2016-01-02 01:07:21	@Espyo	this poll just seems more like a poll to get people to give their reactions
2016-01-02 01:07:26	@Espyo	so it doesn't need as much thought
2016-01-02 01:07:30	@Espyo	and the reactions it has are good enough

2016-01-02 01:08:47	@PikFan	well, like I said, it's something simple I thought of, since we should get it in at least before you go to sleep
2016-01-02 01:09:29	@PikFan	we can come up with a more creative poll later

2016-01-02 01:22:34	@PikFan	eh, screw it
2016-01-02 01:22:44	@PikFan	can you make the poll, please?
2016-01-02 01:24:11	ScruffyChat	I just got an idea
2016-01-02 01:24:14	ScruffyChat	for a poll
2016-01-02 01:24:27	ScruffyChat	"If you could work on the next Pikmin game, what would you most like to work on?
2016-01-02 01:24:45	ScruffyChat	Enemies, areas, music, etc.

2016-01-02 01:43:51	@PikFan	lost by a landslide
2016-01-02 01:43:56	@PikFan	hardly a surprise, though
2016-01-02 01:44:25	@PikFan	the opposing team had all those level 50's on it
2016-01-02 01:45:05	@PikFan	so I quit that group and am now joining a new one
2016-01-02 01:45:15	@PikFan	...still has a ton of level 40's in it :|
2016-01-02 01:45:24	@PikFan	I'm going to die again
2016-01-02 01:48:37	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-01-02 01:48:42	@PikFan	I actually won that time
2016-01-02 01:48:45	@PikFan	just barely, though
2016-01-02 01:49:11	@PikFan	Espyo, do you use motion controls?
2016-01-02 01:50:01	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-02 01:50:04	@Espyo	they take some getting used to
2016-01-02 01:50:07	@Espyo	but wow they're amazing
2016-01-02 01:51:30	ScruffyChat	Just got the crazy idea of mixing the Hole of Heroes cave music with Bingo Battle menu music
2016-01-02 01:51:35	ScruffyChat	Not as bad as I thought
2016-01-02 01:52:31	@PikFan	ok, maybe that's why I'm not good
2016-01-02 01:52:36	@PikFan	I don't use motion controls
2016-01-02 01:52:51	@PikFan	and I find myself not being able to aim at the enemy fast enough
2016-01-02 01:52:52	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: lol
2016-01-02 01:53:31	@PikFan	but yeah, I haven't been using motion controls because I really just don't have the patience to get used to them
2016-01-02 01:53:42	ScruffyChat	Uuggggghhh until they get out of tempo sync
2016-01-02 01:53:45	@PikFan	how many people would you say use motion controls
2016-01-02 01:53:49	@PikFan	?
2016-01-02 01:53:50	@Espyo	over half
2016-01-02 01:53:55	@PikFan	ScruffyChat: ooh, nice
2016-01-02 01:53:56	@Espyo	most top-level players use it
2016-01-02 01:54:02	@PikFan	figures
2016-01-02 01:54:03	@Espyo	because you get aiming options you can't get with the stick
2016-01-02 01:54:10	@PikFan	right, like I said
2016-01-02 01:54:15	ScruffyChat	same with Pikmin
2016-01-02 01:54:16	@PikFan	I aim too slow; they splat me first
2016-01-02 01:54:24	@PikFan	true
2016-01-02 01:54:26	@Espyo	it gets some taking used to
2016-01-02 01:54:28	@Espyo	but it's not HARD
2016-01-02 01:54:35	@Espyo	it comes quite natural after a bit
2016-01-02 01:54:52	@Espyo	and you can combine it with the stick to maximize efficiency
2016-01-02 01:55:19	@PikFan	what's your camera sensitivity?
2016-01-02 01:56:38	@Espyo	don't remember, but +2 if I had to guess
2016-01-02 01:56:49	@PikFan	I see

2016-01-02 02:04:26	ScruffyChat	it's really impressive
2016-01-02 02:04:33	@PikFan	thanks
2016-01-02 02:05:02	@PikFan	now onto Chapter 6!
2016-01-02 02:05:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2016-01-02 02:05:14	ScruffyChat	Remind me of what happens there?
2016-01-02 02:06:17	@PikFan	hang on a sec
2016-01-02 02:08:15	@PikFan	the Red Pikmin meet the Winged Pikmin
2016-01-02 02:08:27	@PikFan	also deals with the aftermath of the Snagret battle
2016-01-02 02:08:45	ScruffyChat	Ah, okay
2016-01-02 02:09:03	@PikFan	sorry, playing Splatoon still
2016-01-02 02:09:12	ScruffyChat	I already picked up some signs of jealousy from the Red PIkmin
2016-01-02 02:09:15	ScruffyChat	Haha no problem
2016-01-02 02:12:24	@PikFan	why do you say that?
2016-01-02 02:13:55	ScruffyChat	I mean of Ignis
2016-01-02 02:16:30	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-02 02:16:40	@PikFan	well, I didn't intend it that way
2016-01-02 02:16:48	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-02 02:16:57	@PikFan	but like, what gave you that impression?
2016-01-02 02:17:14	ScruffyChat	At least with Amber, being impressed and saying he overdid it
2016-01-02 02:17:29	ScruffyChat	At the time it seemed to me like she was concealing jealousy
2016-01-02 02:17:40	ScruffyChat	But now I realize it might just be worry that Ignis is too powerful
2016-01-02 02:20:32	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-01-02 02:20:47	@PikFan	well, she just doesn't want to admit how powerful Ignis is
2016-01-02 02:20:51	@PikFan	kinda like a pride thing
2016-01-02 02:21:09	@PikFan	does that make sense...?
2016-01-02 02:21:38	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-02 02:22:06	ScruffyChat	Is there any reason to be concerned that Ignis is maybe too powerful?
2016-01-02 02:22:15	ScruffyChat	Or can you not reveal that yet?
2016-01-02 02:24:46	@PikFan	explain
2016-01-02 02:25:11	@PikFan	like, do you see him being too powerful as a bad thing?
2016-01-02 02:25:57	ScruffyChat	Well, if he had enough power to shockwave the whole Awakening Wood, he could be dangerous to other Pikmin
2016-01-02 02:26:12	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-02 02:26:28	@PikFan	well, I meant like the sound of the explosion
2016-01-02 02:26:37	@PikFan	I guess that wasn't really clear
2016-01-02 02:26:41	ScruffyChat	Oh, he
2016-01-02 02:26:42	ScruffyChat	heh*
2016-01-02 02:27:32	@PikFan	like, the shockwave was only for the treetop
2016-01-02 02:27:39	@PikFan	but the sound of the explosion went much farther
2016-01-02 02:27:46	@PikFan	kinda like volcanoes
2016-01-02 02:27:54	@PikFan	like, you can feel the explosion closeup
2016-01-02 02:28:01	@PikFan	but further away, you can only hear it
2016-01-02 02:28:03	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-02 02:28:09	ScruffyChat	Still, it's very powerful
2016-01-02 02:28:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-02 02:28:17	ScruffyChat	Coming from just a little Red Pikmin
2016-01-02 02:28:27	ScruffyChat	I'm just hoping he'll be able to contain
2016-01-02 02:28:34	ScruffyChat	Oh, one other thing
2016-01-02 02:28:38	@PikFan	hm?
2016-01-02 02:28:43	ScruffyChat	I'm sorry I didn't notice this sooner
2016-01-02 02:29:03	ScruffyChat	But Ruby's enchantment, the Crimson Lotus Cage
2016-01-02 02:29:13	ScruffyChat	she said for it to banish all that is evil
2016-01-02 02:29:21	ScruffyChat	Is the Tree Snagret evil?
2016-01-02 02:29:26	ScruffyChat	I thought it was legendary
2016-01-02 02:29:35	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-02 02:29:42	@PikFan	well, "evil" in her mind
2016-01-02 02:29:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-02 02:29:57	@PikFan	and by legendary I meant like formidable but also rare
2016-01-02 02:30:13	ScruffyChat	True, it's not necessarily the opposite of evil
2016-01-02 02:30:20	ScruffyChat	And the Tree Snagret certainly does act evilly
2016-01-02 02:30:40	@PikFan	but...?
2016-01-02 02:31:05	ScruffyChat	no no, I just write things down as I piece them together
2016-01-02 02:31:09	ScruffyChat	I agree wiht you
2016-01-02 02:31:15	@PikFan	ah, okay
2016-01-02 02:31:25	@PikFan	there was also one minor detail I had forgotten to remove
2016-01-02 02:31:34	ScruffyChat	What's that?
2016-01-02 02:31:45	@PikFan	early on in the chapter, Ruby says the Snagret said that it'd feed them to its chicks
2016-01-02 02:31:56	@PikFan	but that's the only mention of its chicks
2016-01-02 02:32:07	@PikFan	I forgot to remove that detail
2016-01-02 02:32:19	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-02 02:32:31	ScruffyChat	Well maybe they find the chicks in the next chapter
2016-01-02 02:32:42	ScruffyChat	And have to decide what to do with them, since they can't fend for themselves
2016-01-02 02:32:44	@PikFan	perhaps
2016-01-02 02:33:46	ScruffyChat	It could be a good intense decision, since they're helpless creatures that should be treated humanely, but if cared for they'll become ruthless Tree Snagrets 
2016-01-02 02:34:22	@PikFan	it's kinda implied that the Tree Snagret was under control of that being
2016-01-02 02:34:38	ScruffyChat	which one?
2016-01-02 02:34:49	@PikFan	the being with the Plan
2016-01-02 02:34:54	ScruffyChat	Oh
2016-01-02 02:35:08	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah, right
2016-01-02 02:35:09	@PikFan	the other creature said that they should've reached the top by now
2016-01-02 02:35:30	@PikFan	so I kinda implied that they sent the Tree Snagret to attack them
2016-01-02 02:35:43	ScruffyChat	Ohhhhhhhh
2016-01-02 02:35:51	@PikFan	I mean, the creatures don't necessarily have to be bad
2016-01-02 02:35:54	@PikFan	they can be good
2016-01-02 02:35:57	ScruffyChat	I'm so dumb, I'm sorry
2016-01-02 02:36:02	@PikFan	no, no, it's fine
2016-01-02 02:36:18	@PikFan	it wasn't very clear is all
2016-01-02 02:36:27	ScruffyChat	But it makes sense
2016-01-02 02:36:35	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-02 02:36:39	@PikFan	so hmm
2016-01-02 02:36:46	ScruffyChat	So yeah, the chicks wouldn't need to be there
2016-01-02 02:36:56	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2016-01-02 02:39:04	ScruffyChat	Unless they were another test from the magical creature
2016-01-02 02:39:11	ScruffyChat	Maybe a trap
2016-01-02 02:39:16	ScruffyChat	YEah
2016-01-02 02:39:46	ScruffyChat	If the Pikmin take the chicks out of pity, the chicks will attack their Onion just at the opportune moment
2016-01-02 02:40:11	ScruffyChat	But if the Pikmin leave the chicks, they're abandoning defenseless creatures, which could stir up internal argument
2016-01-02 02:40:20	@PikFan	that's clever
2016-01-02 02:40:55	ScruffyChat	I always think of stuff like this because it challenges you to think of what your character would do
2016-01-02 02:41:01	ScruffyChat	It challenges your characterization
2016-01-02 02:41:16	ScruffyChat	That's what I did with the chapter about Louie almost cooking a PIkmin
2016-01-02 02:41:34	ScruffyChat	I have to know his limits as well as he does
2016-01-02 02:42:33	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/PikminFanon:Pikmin_Story_Archive#Chapter_5:_Fiery_Hope
2016-01-02 02:42:36	@PikFan	wait, no
2016-01-02 02:42:48	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=PikminFanon%3APikmin_Story_Archive&action=historysubmit&diff=51332&oldid=51163
2016-01-02 02:42:51	@PikFan	and yeah
2016-01-02 02:43:09	@PikFan	this, plus the mistrust over the Winged Pikmin, could give rise to some interesting dissent
2016-01-02 02:43:18	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-02 02:43:59	ScruffyChat	Maybe that's it, the two Pikmin camps are rivaled on how to treat the Snagret chicks
2016-01-02 02:44:28	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-02 02:44:40	ScruffyChat	Reading this, I really wanted to put it to animation, now that I have a posable Red Pikmin model
2016-01-02 02:44:46	ScruffyChat	But it's too big a task
2016-01-02 02:44:49	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-02 02:44:51	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-01-02 02:45:18	ScruffyChat	plus I'd have no idea what to do with their mouths
2016-01-02 02:45:31	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-01-02 02:45:39	@PikFan	that's the problem with Pikmin fanfictions
2016-01-02 02:45:51	@PikFan	is how do they communicate, since we don't see any given mouths
2016-01-02 02:46:01	ScruffyChat	Pheromones
2016-01-02 02:46:09	@PikFan	telepathy
2016-01-02 02:46:18	ScruffyChat	They write each other
2016-01-02 02:47:17	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, that reminds me, I uploaded a progress render on the Blues Pikmin scene, if you're interested
2016-01-02 02:47:21	ScruffyChat	It's on the forums
2016-01-02 02:47:31	ScruffyChat	http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/thread/144/blues-pikmin-artwork?page=2
2016-01-02 02:47:38	ScruffyChat	i'm looking for suggestions
2016-01-02 02:48:02	@PikFan	woah
2016-01-02 02:48:06	@PikFan	I love it!
2016-01-02 02:48:12	ScruffyChat	Thanks :)
2016-01-02 02:48:21	@PikFan	I actually chuckled a bit
2016-01-02 02:48:50	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-01-02 02:48:53	ScruffyChat	It's pretty silly
2016-01-02 02:49:05	ScruffyChat	But I've already come up with the rest of the scen
2016-01-02 02:49:07	ScruffyChat	scene*
2016-01-02 02:49:14	ScruffyChat	Red Pikmin on keyboard
2016-01-02 02:49:21	ScruffyChat	Purple Pikmin on bass
2016-01-02 02:49:27	ScruffyChat	Yellow Pikmin on alto sax
2016-01-02 02:49:45	ScruffyChat	And either one of the leaders or a Rock Pikmin on drums
2016-01-02 02:50:17	@PikFan	neat
2016-01-02 02:50:25	@PikFan	I can't wait for the final version
2016-01-02 02:50:27	ScruffyChat	Make that, a Purple Pikmin playing a Wraith "Dream Series" J-bass
2016-01-02 02:50:35	@PikFan	ooooooh
2016-01-02 02:50:42	@PikFan	/exquisite/
2016-01-02 02:50:46	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-01-02 02:52:58	ScruffyChat	This one is also going over a million polygons
2016-01-02 02:53:05	@PikFan	wow
2016-01-02 02:53:09	ScruffyChat	But it's worth it
2016-01-02 02:53:41	@PikFan	am I the first person to see this?
2016-01-02 02:53:47	ScruffyChat	Probably
2016-01-02 02:54:09	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-02 02:54:18	@PikFan	I have to say, I love the teeth
2016-01-02 02:54:23	ScruffyChat	Heh thanks
2016-01-02 02:54:24	@PikFan	they're so out of place
2016-01-02 02:54:29	ScruffyChat	I was worried
2016-01-02 02:54:29	@PikFan	but that's what makes it great
2016-01-02 02:54:39	ScruffyChat	I studied a lot of Ray Charles faces
2016-01-02 02:55:11	ScruffyChat	But I needed something that looked forceful
2016-01-02 02:55:17	ScruffyChat	But still cool
2016-01-02 02:55:30	ScruffyChat	Because that's how people look playing guitar solos
2016-01-02 02:56:04	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-02 02:56:30	ScruffyChat	Oh shoot!
2016-01-02 02:56:35	ScruffyChat	I meant to put a pick in his hand
2016-01-02 02:56:55	ScruffyChat	well, that's why it's a progress render
2016-01-02 02:58:41	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-02 02:58:43	@PikFan	no worries
2016-01-02 03:00:31	ScruffyChat	After I get all these requests done I think I might go on a request hiatus for a while
2016-01-02 03:00:41	ScruffyChat	Schoolwork just doesn't let me get to these
2016-01-02 03:01:22	@PikFan	ugh
2016-01-02 03:01:29	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2016-01-02 03:01:30	@PikFan	when does your break end?
2016-01-02 03:01:40	ScruffyChat	the 11th
2016-01-02 03:01:46	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-02 03:01:51	ScruffyChat	But I still have composing to do throughout the break
2016-01-02 03:01:53	@PikFan	and yet you still have schoolwork...
2016-01-02 03:01:58	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-02 03:02:31	ScruffyChat	I don't know
2016-01-02 03:02:47	ScruffyChat	I still feel like I can manage it
2016-01-02 03:03:23	ScruffyChat	I don't want to deny anyone getting a CG version of their idea or music
2016-01-02 03:03:46	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-01-02 03:03:52	@PikFan	well, try not to overdo things
2016-01-02 03:04:08	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-02 03:04:35	ScruffyChat	Well, my schedule's actually a little less demanding this semester, I think
2016-01-02 03:04:45	ScruffyChat	Maybe I won't do hiatus
2016-01-02 03:05:02	ScruffyChat	I just need to finish these requests
2016-01-02 03:05:11	ScruffyChat	It's not just schoolwork, it's laziness
2016-01-02 03:05:17	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-01-02 03:05:29	@PikFan	I wish laziness didn't exist
2016-01-02 03:05:43	@PikFan	if it didn't, I'd probably be at like chapter 15 right now
2016-01-02 03:05:55	ScruffyChat	Yeah, but we'd play a lot fewer videogames
2016-01-02 03:05:57	@PikFan	chapter 15... wow
2016-01-02 03:06:08	@PikFan	well...
2016-01-02 03:06:15	@PikFan	hm, I guess
2016-01-02 03:06:46	ScruffyChat	What do you think will happen by Chapter 15?
2016-01-02 03:06:59	ScruffyChat	If you've thought that far ahead, I commend you
2016-01-02 03:07:14	ScruffyChat	I have a nasty habit of writing stream-of-consciousness style
2016-01-02 03:09:21	@PikFan	I'm not too sure
2016-01-02 03:09:33	@PikFan	I think the war will have started by then
2016-01-02 03:09:40	ScruffyChat	WAR?!
2016-01-02 03:09:45	ScruffyChat	Oooh I'm so hyped
2016-01-02 03:09:55	ScruffyChat	I mean, war is awful
2016-01-02 03:10:02	ScruffyChat	I'm just hyped for the story
2016-01-02 03:10:08	@PikFan	yeah, there's going to be a huge attack on the Pikmin capital
2016-01-02 03:10:19	ScruffyChat	By the magical creature?
2016-01-02 03:10:23	ScruffyChat	Or by Pikmin
2016-01-02 03:10:25	@PikFan	yeah, and his armies
2016-01-02 03:10:37	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-02 03:10:45	@PikFan	OH, YEAH
2016-01-02 03:10:48	@PikFan	I remembered
2016-01-02 03:10:51	@PikFan	ok, so
2016-01-02 03:11:21	@PikFan	I know in most fantasy series there's some kind of relic that has unbelievable power
2016-01-02 03:11:33	@PikFan	so I thought, why not make one for my story?
2016-01-02 03:11:43	@PikFan	and then that's when I came up with...
2016-01-02 03:11:47	@PikFan	the Starflower
2016-01-02 03:12:04	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2016-01-02 03:12:23	ScruffyChat	What sort of unbelievable power does it possess?
2016-01-02 03:12:33	@PikFan	I'm not too sure, really
2016-01-02 03:12:40	@PikFan	but there's more than one
2016-01-02 03:12:52	@PikFan	there's a white one, a pink one, and an indigo one
2016-01-02 03:13:02	@PikFan	to reflect the 7 canon types' flowers
2016-01-02 03:13:42	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2016-01-02 03:15:04	ScruffyChat	Are they all in one place, you think?
2016-01-02 03:15:10	@PikFan	no
2016-01-02 03:15:17	@PikFan	scattered across the world
2016-01-02 03:15:32	@PikFan	what's more, the parallel PNF-404 has its own Starflowers, too
2016-01-02 03:16:16	@PikFan	they'll be black, green, and gold
2016-01-02 03:16:30	@PikFan	the opposites of white, pink, and indigo
2016-01-02 03:16:38	@PikFan	...according to Paint
2016-01-02 03:16:49	@PikFan	(I took their flower colors and inverted them)
2016-01-02 03:17:05	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-02 03:19:27	ScruffyChat	When will that parallel world come into play?
2016-01-02 03:19:30	ScruffyChat	After the war?
2016-01-02 03:20:02	@PikFan	during the war
2016-01-02 03:20:07	ScruffyChat	oh man
2016-01-02 03:20:20	@PikFan	basically, they're escaping
2016-01-02 03:20:28	ScruffyChat	Ah, I see
2016-01-02 03:20:47	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@216.4.ix.ghn) has joined #pikipedia
2016-01-02 03:21:20	@PikFan	so I'm thinking that the Pikmin will have one Starflower, the magical creature will have another one, and the third will be hidden somewhere
2016-01-02 03:21:31	@PikFan	see, there's a portal connecting the two worlds
2016-01-02 03:21:33	Neocraftz1553	I know I'm a little late but happy new year
2016-01-02 03:21:40	@PikFan	and it requires a Starflower to open
2016-01-02 03:21:43	@PikFan	happy new year!
2016-01-02 03:22:10	Neocraftz1553	so, whats up

2016-01-02 03:25:11	ScruffyChat	If you'll allow it, PikFan
2016-01-02 03:25:13	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 03:25:13	@PikFan	Captain's Return, Dream or Nightmare, and Mysterious World (which is mine)
2016-01-02 03:25:20	@PikFan	oh, yeah, that's totally fine
2016-01-02 03:25:27	ScruffyChat	Yay!
2016-01-02 03:25:42	Neocraftz1553	does the one with the tree snagret count?

2016-01-02 03:26:35	@PikFan	yay, thanks
2016-01-02 03:27:03	Neocraftz1553	np
2016-01-02 03:27:11	@PikFan	meanwhile, over at fanfiction.net, I STILL don't have any reviews
2016-01-02 03:27:21	@PikFan	and yet my story is decently long...
2016-01-02 03:27:34	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-02 03:27:46	@PikFan	maybe when I copied it over, I shouldn't have done the whole thing at once
2016-01-02 03:27:58	Neocraftz1553	Since when did yoi post it?
2016-01-02 03:28:06	@PikFan	I posted it there back in June
2016-01-02 03:28:07	Neocraftz1553	like what month
2016-01-02 03:28:12	Neocraftz1553	hm
2016-01-02 03:28:20	@PikFan	but see, I posted all the chapters I had then
2016-01-02 03:28:31	Neocraftz1553	well fanfic.net isn't exactly bustling...
2016-01-02 03:28:44	@PikFan	and I realized that if I had posted one chapter like say, every month, I'd probably keep interest
2016-01-02 03:28:45	@PikFan	true
2016-01-02 03:30:37	Neocraftz1553	brb
2016-01-02 03:30:41	@PikFan	ok
2016-01-02 03:31:11	ScruffyChat	Thank you for your critiques on the latest chapter of Louie, by the way
2016-01-02 03:31:19	ScruffyChat	Sorry I had to hurry out when you read it
2016-01-02 03:31:27	@PikFan	oh, yeah, no problem
2016-01-02 03:31:43	ScruffyChat	But I've made that section more clear
2016-01-02 03:32:44	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-02 03:32:56	<--	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@216.4.ix.ghn) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-01-02 03:33:05	@PikFan	semi-related, but how does this sound? it's a summary of my story
2016-01-02 03:33:08	@PikFan	"After the events of the Pikmin series, a Red Pikmin is born who can control fire. Unfortunately, he was born in tense times, and a war with the monsters is slowly approaching. He and many other Pikmin eventually escape to a parallel PNF-404 to turn the tides, but what will happen there? Will they survive? Rated T for violence."
2016-01-02 03:33:22	@PikFan	*turn the tides in the war
2016-01-02 03:35:11	ScruffyChat	That sounds good!
2016-01-02 03:35:30	@PikFan	ah, okay
2016-01-02 03:36:07	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@216.4.ix.ghn) has joined #pikipedia
2016-01-02 03:36:21	Neocraftz1553	I am back
2016-01-02 03:36:31	@PikFan	hi
2016-01-02 03:37:34	Neocraftz1553	just figured out how to make bridges in espyos engine
2016-01-02 03:38:03	ScruffyChat	Oh, I wanted to ask you a question about your request
2016-01-02 03:38:21	ScruffyChat	I think I'll do the one of Olimar's son with Mushroom Pikmin sneaking around the Orange Bulborb
2016-01-02 03:38:33	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 03:38:36	Neocraftz1553	thats fine
2016-01-02 03:38:54	ScruffyChat	but is there something particular about the Mushroom Pikmin eyes you'd like me to keep in mind?
2016-01-02 03:39:00	ScruffyChat	How would you like them to look?
2016-01-02 03:39:58	Neocraftz1553	like a "U"
2016-01-02 03:40:10	Neocraftz1553	so they look like UU or uu idk
2016-01-02 03:40:13	ScruffyChat	Ah, like they were in /PIkmin/
2016-01-02 03:40:19	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-02 03:40:27	ScruffyChat	that'll be no problem
2016-01-02 03:40:46	Neocraftz1553	maybe add some emotion if you have time or if you want but a u is good
2016-01-02 03:41:10	Neocraftz1553	idk how that'll work out since they only have eyez though
2016-01-02 03:41:18	Neocraftz1553	*eyes
2016-01-02 03:41:51	ScruffyChat	I'll work it out, they can look sneaky
2016-01-02 03:42:02	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-02 03:42:11	Neocraftz1553	thank you for doing the request
2016-01-02 03:42:16	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-01-02 03:42:23	ScruffyChat	I'm happy to do it
2016-01-02 03:42:42	ScruffyChat	I'm just sorry if it might take a little bit, I have a lot of schoolwork to attend to along with this
2016-01-02 03:43:11	Neocraftz1553	also, can you, by any chance send me your blender "previews" of areas?
2016-01-02 03:43:17	Neocraftz1553	as blender files
2016-01-02 03:43:25	Neocraftz1553	its ok if it takes a while
2016-01-02 03:43:30	ScruffyChat	I could, but I'll have to warn you
2016-01-02 03:43:41	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure how well image textures will work
2016-01-02 03:44:05	ScruffyChat	When I create these, I don't always map objects, sometimes I use procedural textures
2016-01-02 03:44:23	ScruffyChat	So I don't know if the textures will be mapped quite the same when I send the file
2016-01-02 03:44:33	ScruffyChat	And these files can reach upwards of 100 MB
2016-01-02 03:44:36	Neocraftz1553	that is fine
2016-01-02 03:44:54	Neocraftz1553	what are procedural textures?
2016-01-02 03:45:09	Neocraftz1553	sorry I am quite new to blender
2016-01-02 03:45:15	ScruffyChat	They are textures that Blender creates using random algorithms
2016-01-02 03:45:21	ScruffyChat	Like random noise or clouds
2016-01-02 03:45:41	ScruffyChat	I mean I can't imagine Blender messing any of it up, but
2016-01-02 03:45:46	ScruffyChat	you never know
2016-01-02 03:45:49	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-02 03:45:52	ScruffyChat	What version do you have?
2016-01-02 03:45:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah ok that is fine
2016-01-02 03:46:19	Neocraftz1553	blender2.76b
2016-01-02 03:46:23	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-02 03:46:27	ScruffyChat	I have 2.75
2016-01-02 03:46:31	Neocraftz1553	latest version I think
2016-01-02 03:46:35	ScruffyChat	So it should be okay
2016-01-02 03:46:36	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 03:46:43	Neocraftz1553	it should
2016-01-02 03:47:10	Neocraftz1553	so how do I get thw files
2016-01-02 03:47:17	ScruffyChat	Umm
2016-01-02 03:47:34	ScruffyChat	thw?
2016-01-02 03:47:41	Neocraftz1553	the
2016-01-02 03:47:54	Neocraftz1553	lol please excuse my spelling
2016-01-02 03:48:19	Neocraftz1553	I'm using a phone
2016-01-02 03:48:24	ScruffyChat	no problem
2016-01-02 03:48:43	ScruffyChat	I can put them on Dropbox I suppose, as long as Dropbox doesn't have some sort of size limit
2016-01-02 03:48:59	Neocraftz1553	I dont think it does
2016-01-02 03:53:15	ScruffyChat	Okay, I'm trying out putting this blend file on Dropbox
2016-01-02 03:53:19	ScruffyChat	and I'll give you the likn
2016-01-02 03:53:21	ScruffyChat	link*
2016-01-02 03:53:27	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 03:54:45	ScruffyChat	try this, it's the Daybreak Glade preview
2016-01-02 03:54:54	ScruffyChat	Let me know if there are any obvious problems
2016-01-02 03:54:55	ScruffyChat	https://www.dropbox.com/s/wanadg3ih4x62e3/Pikmin%20Forever%20Cycles.blend?dl=0
2016-01-02 03:55:16	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 03:55:55	Neocraftz1553	 40mb
2016-01-02 03:56:01	Neocraftz1553	not too big
2016-01-02 03:58:26	Neocraftz1553	I'm rendering it...
2016-01-02 03:59:05	ScruffyChat	I might need to pack the images in it
2016-01-02 03:59:11	ScruffyChat	Are any textures showing up?
2016-01-02 03:59:16	Neocraftz1553	whats the
2016-01-02 03:59:22	Neocraftz1553	wait
2016-01-02 03:59:39	Neocraftz1553	uh yeah you might need to pack images
2016-01-02 04:00:15	Neocraftz1553	It shows olimar and all, but its purple on top of the origional colors
2016-01-02 04:00:30	Neocraftz1553	I mean, LOTS of purple and pink
2016-01-02 04:00:44	Neocraftz1553	kind of like noise, if you know what I mean
2016-01-02 04:00:58	ScruffyChat	Ah, purple means it can't find the textures
2016-01-02 04:01:13	Neocraftz1553	anyways, whats the difference between cycles and blender render
2016-01-02 04:01:41	Neocraftz1553	pruple and black means missing textures in most cases
2016-01-02 04:01:48	ScruffyChat	blender render is the internal renderer for Blender, it's basic and good for game design but not very realistic
2016-01-02 04:02:03	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-01-02 04:02:04	ScruffyChat	Cycles is MUCH more accurate at tracing rays of light
2016-01-02 04:02:13	Neocraftz1553	ahh thats what I need
2016-01-02 04:02:56	@PikFan	wait so you just use the internal renderer for simple objects, and Cycles for more detailed scenes, like the Torrid Desert preview?
2016-01-02 04:02:58	Neocraftz1553	blender render is kinda... blocky and edgy
2016-01-02 04:03:30	Neocraftz1553	let me try cycles on another blender creation of mine
2016-01-02 04:04:38	ScruffyChat	If you try cycles, you need to completely rethink and redo the materials you build
2016-01-02 04:04:53	ScruffyChat	Cycles doesn't just have settings for materials, you have to build the material
2016-01-02 04:04:56	Neocraftz1553	yeah, I noticed
2016-01-02 04:05:09	ScruffyChat	I can show you once I pack these image textures
2016-01-02 04:05:25	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:05:43	Neocraftz1553	did you make the grass from a mesh?!?
2016-01-02 04:06:04	Neocraftz1553	I use the hair particle
2016-01-02 04:06:30	Neocraftz1553	and they look like clumped up thin spikes
2016-01-02 04:06:32	ScruffyChat	I found a grass mesh and then made that into hair
2016-01-02 04:06:52	ScruffyChat	I was too lazy to make a grass mesh from scratch
2016-01-02 04:07:01	ScruffyChat	But blender can use any object as a particle
2016-01-02 04:07:32	Neocraftz1553	hmm...ok
2016-01-02 04:08:21	Neocraftz1553	heh heh heh... it must've taken ages to render the Daybreak Glade
2016-01-02 04:08:32	ScruffyChat	30 minutes or so
2016-01-02 04:08:41	Neocraftz1553	ages I say
2016-01-02 04:08:43	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-02 04:08:44	ScruffyChat	Hehe
2016-01-02 04:08:50	ScruffyChat	Ok, I'm resending it
2016-01-02 04:09:01	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:09:48	Neocraftz1553	do I re-download it
2016-01-02 04:09:57	Neocraftz1553	or is it another link
2016-01-02 04:10:07	ScruffyChat	It's another link
2016-01-02 04:10:10	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:10:11	ScruffyChat	I'll have it up in a sec
2016-01-02 04:10:22	ScruffyChat	it has 20 more MB on it thanks to the textures
2016-01-02 04:10:26	Neocraftz1553	huh, the lag is intense
2016-01-02 04:10:31	ScruffyChat	But hopefully that'll help it show it
2016-01-02 04:10:33	ScruffyChat	up*
2016-01-02 04:10:35	ScruffyChat	Sorry
2016-01-02 04:10:41	Neocraftz1553	yeah thats ok
2016-01-02 04:10:45	ScruffyChat	You should see the lag on the Sunset Islet render
2016-01-02 04:11:00	Neocraftz1553	what
2016-01-02 04:11:08	Neocraftz1553	isn't it just
2016-01-02 04:11:10	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-01-02 04:11:14	Neocraftz1553	the tree
2016-01-02 04:11:24	Neocraftz1553	more stuff to render
2016-01-02 04:11:27	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-02 04:11:34	ScruffyChat	I'll be just a minute more, it's uploading
2016-01-02 04:11:38	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:12:15	ScruffyChat	when you click on an object in this file, try going to the Node Editor screen (rather than 3D view)
2016-01-02 04:12:22	ScruffyChat	Then you can see how the materials are constructed

2016-01-02 04:14:32	ScruffyChat	no problem
2016-01-02 04:15:01	Neocraftz1553	ok im downloading it
2016-01-02 04:15:24	Neocraftz1553	yeah, did you have it in a specific folder?
2016-01-02 04:15:27	@PikFan	wait Scruffy
2016-01-02 04:15:31	Neocraftz1553	the textures
2016-01-02 04:15:41	@PikFan	is this a 3D render? http://www.pikminfanon.com/images/a/ac/Pikmin_Dark_Forces_Logo_by_Scruffy.png
2016-01-02 04:15:50	Neocraftz1553	yes i think
2016-01-02 04:15:55	ScruffyChat	From what I understand they now come already in the blend file
2016-01-02 04:16:06	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:16:07	ScruffyChat	Pikfan: yes
2016-01-02 04:16:14	@PikFan	ah, okay
2016-01-02 04:16:19	@PikFan	it looks very... 2D
2016-01-02 04:16:24	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-02 04:16:31	ScruffyChat	I had to use an object that was the logo, and then add particle effects for the... particles
2016-01-02 04:16:43	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-02 04:16:43	ScruffyChat	Blender is just as good for 2D art as 3D
2016-01-02 04:16:52	ScruffyChat	well..
2016-01-02 04:16:54	@PikFan	so technically there's depth in there, too?
2016-01-02 04:17:09	ScruffyChat	yeah, I guess it doesn't belong to "3D" rendered images
2016-01-02 04:17:09	Neocraftz1553	except twice as hard and thrice as good
2016-01-02 04:17:19	Neocraftz1553	hmm
2016-01-02 04:17:32	Neocraftz1553	it does look better yhan it would in 2D
2016-01-02 04:20:11	Neocraftz1553	ok I got it
2016-01-02 04:20:28	ScruffyChat	cool
2016-01-02 04:20:46	Neocraftz1553	rendering
2016-01-02 04:21:40	Neocraftz1553	uhh theres alot of fuzzyness
2016-01-02 04:21:45	Neocraftz1553	like noise
2016-01-02 04:22:09	ScruffyChat	That's because the sampling is low
2016-01-02 04:22:12	ScruffyChat	let's see
2016-01-02 04:22:18	ScruffyChat	in render settings (the camera)
2016-01-02 04:22:27	ScruffyChat	there should be a section called Sampling
2016-01-02 04:22:50	Neocraftz1553	ok let me see
2016-01-02 04:23:28	ScruffyChat	that's the thing about Cycles's advanced lighting, it makes more noise because light is harder to calculate
2016-01-02 04:23:36	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:23:37	ScruffyChat	But it'll always be more realistic than Blender Render
2016-01-02 04:23:46	Neocraftz1553	yes I found the sampling
2016-01-02 04:23:50	Neocraftz1553	thinf
2016-01-02 04:23:52	Neocraftz1553	thing
2016-01-02 04:23:55	ScruffyChat	okay
2016-01-02 04:24:01	Neocraftz1553	whst do I turn up
2016-01-02 04:24:03	ScruffyChat	what is the render sampling set to
2016-01-02 04:24:17	Neocraftz1553	 200
2016-01-02 04:24:27	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-01-02 04:24:31	ScruffyChat	hmm
2016-01-02 04:24:35	ScruffyChat	then it shouldn't be too noisy
2016-01-02 04:24:38	Neocraftz1553	preview is 10
2016-01-02 04:24:51	Neocraftz1553	I used preview, I didn't render it yet
2016-01-02 04:24:57	Neocraftz1553	like with the camera
2016-01-02 04:25:00	ScruffyChat	ohhh
2016-01-02 04:25:06	ScruffyChat	then yes, it will be noisy
2016-01-02 04:25:10	ScruffyChat	increase preview to 50
2016-01-02 04:25:16	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:25:27	ScruffyChat	and also, if you put your mouse in the 3d view and press w
2016-01-02 04:25:41	Neocraftz1553	why
2016-01-02 04:25:43	ScruffyChat	there should be an option to restrict the render preview to what's visible in the camera
2016-01-02 04:25:50	ScruffyChat	that way it goes faster
2016-01-02 04:26:01	ScruffyChat	it's called "Camera as Render Border"
2016-01-02 04:26:08	ScruffyChat	if you don't have it that's fine
2016-01-02 04:26:42	Neocraftz1553	no dont have it
2016-01-02 04:26:47	ScruffyChat	That's ok
2016-01-02 04:27:00	Neocraftz1553	yeah it's kinda settling down
2016-01-02 04:27:01	ScruffyChat	just set the preview sampling to 50
2016-01-02 04:27:05	ScruffyChat	yesh
2016-01-02 04:27:06	Neocraftz1553	might take a while
2016-01-02 04:27:07	ScruffyChat	yeah*
2016-01-02 04:27:21	Neocraftz1553	yeah looking better
2016-01-02 04:27:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the more times it samples light rays, the more accurately it can simulate them
2016-01-02 04:28:09	Neocraftz1553	PUT IT OVER 9000!!!!!
2016-01-02 04:28:12	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-01-02 04:28:17	ScruffyChat	Nooooo
2016-01-02 04:28:19	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-01-02 04:28:27	Neocraftz1553	the more samples the longer it'll take
2016-01-02 04:28:35	ScruffyChat	seriously, more than 250 can sometimes crash blender for me
2016-01-02 04:28:45	ScruffyChat	but I don't have a computer optimized for Blender anyway
2016-01-02 04:28:48	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-02 04:29:08	Neocraftz1553	yeah still kinda fuzzy, but I'll figure it out
2016-01-02 04:29:24	Neocraftz1553	render is different from preview
2016-01-02 04:29:32	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-01-02 04:29:46	ScruffyChat	Render sampling is what it takes when it converts the preview to an image
2016-01-02 04:30:06	Neocraftz1553	the only thing that is missing is olimars head and hands
2016-01-02 04:30:12	ScruffyChat	oh dear
2016-01-02 04:30:12	Neocraftz1553	but that is minor
2016-01-02 04:30:24	ScruffyChat	That's shouldn't be happening
2016-01-02 04:30:34	ScruffyChat	do they appear in solid mode?
2016-01-02 04:31:00	Neocraftz1553	they are there but the textures arent
2016-01-02 04:31:07	ScruffyChat	hmm
2016-01-02 04:31:08	Neocraftz1553	his suit is fine
2016-01-02 04:31:31	ScruffyChat	Oh, I know why
2016-01-02 04:31:35	Neocraftz1553	its only some buttons his head his hands and his air tank thingy
2016-01-02 04:31:38	Neocraftz1553	why
2016-01-02 04:31:51	ScruffyChat	the material for his face and hands are using an old texture that is no longer on my computer
2016-01-02 04:32:01	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-01-02 04:32:19	Neocraftz1553	what are the textures you used called
2016-01-02 04:32:23	ScruffyChat	I had had to edit the texture to make a render of olimar's wife
2016-01-02 04:32:33	ScruffyChat	and the old Olimar texture is gone
2016-01-02 04:32:34	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-01-02 04:32:43	Neocraftz1553	yeah I see
2016-01-02 04:32:44	ScruffyChat	the Olimar I see in this file has makeup
2016-01-02 04:32:50	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-02 04:33:14	Neocraftz1553	thats fine
2016-01-02 04:33:14	ScruffyChat	the texture should be called FitPikminFace_png
2016-01-02 04:33:43	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-02 04:34:10	Neocraftz1553	I might borrow your grass if its ok with you
2016-01-02 04:34:21	Neocraftz1553	its cause I can't make any good grass
2016-01-02 04:34:57	ScruffyChat	No problem
2016-01-02 04:35:03	ScruffyChat	it's not really my grass anyway
2016-01-02 04:35:06	ScruffyChat	I found the model online
2016-01-02 04:35:11	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-02 04:35:24	ScruffyChat	But the grass in the scene is just particles
2016-01-02 04:35:30	ScruffyChat	The true objects are behind the camera
2016-01-02 04:35:37	ScruffyChat	there are all sorts of little tufts
2016-01-02 04:35:45	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:36:09	Neocraftz1553	Its really neat how you made more of the area, not just whats on the camera
2016-01-02 04:36:31	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2016-01-02 04:36:49	ScruffyChat	most of it's on camera, but it's all about adding little details like that
2016-01-02 04:37:10	ScruffyChat	Try this
2016-01-02 04:37:11	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-02 04:37:18	ScruffyChat	Select the water
2016-01-02 04:37:22	Neocraftz1553	much of it is not even on camera
2016-01-02 04:37:30	Neocraftz1553	the water?
2016-01-02 04:37:33	ScruffyChat	And in the bottom left corner
2016-01-02 04:37:43	ScruffyChat	switch from 3d view to node editor
2016-01-02 04:38:12	Neocraftz1553	ah that
2016-01-02 04:38:14	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:38:32	ScruffyChat	With this I can show you how Cycles materials work
2016-01-02 04:38:59	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:39:06	ScruffyChat	do you see 5 nodes, one called Refraction BSDF, one called Glossy BSDF, and so on>?
2016-01-02 04:39:15	Neocraftz1553	how do I zoom in to the node thingys
2016-01-02 04:39:35	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure if you don't have a trackpad
2016-01-02 04:39:53	ScruffyChat	it should be how you zoom in normally in 3d view
2016-01-02 04:40:00	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:40:06	Neocraftz1553	Kinda freaked out there
2016-01-02 04:40:10	ScruffyChat	sorry
2016-01-02 04:40:21	Neocraftz1553	thats fine
2016-01-02 04:40:26	ScruffyChat	well you should see five nodes there
2016-01-02 04:40:31	Neocraftz1553	theres five
2016-01-02 04:40:35	ScruffyChat	That's all what forms the water material
2016-01-02 04:40:43	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-02 04:40:47	Neocraftz1553	very complex
2016-01-02 04:40:51	ScruffyChat	the two called BSDF are shaders
2016-01-02 04:40:53	Neocraftz1553	well to me anyways
2016-01-02 04:40:59	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:41:03	ScruffyChat	one is Glossy, which means it reflects light
2016-01-02 04:41:16	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-02 04:41:18	ScruffyChat	the other is Refraction, which lets light through but refracts it
2016-01-02 04:41:19	Neocraftz1553	like water
2016-01-02 04:41:23	ScruffyChat	right
2016-01-02 04:41:31	ScruffyChat	those are mixed together using Mix Shader
2016-01-02 04:41:32	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:41:40	Neocraftz1553	I see
2016-01-02 04:41:53	ScruffyChat	but in order to tell Blender how to mix them, I used a factor called Fresnel
2016-01-02 04:42:02	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-02 04:42:05	Neocraftz1553	what does it do
2016-01-02 04:42:15	ScruffyChat	Fresnel effect is how things change appearance depending on the angle you view them at
2016-01-02 04:42:26	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-02 04:42:30	Neocraftz1553	thats very cool
2016-01-02 04:42:31	ScruffyChat	For example, water gets more reflective as you view it more and more parallel
2016-01-02 04:42:35	ScruffyChat	thank you
2016-01-02 04:42:52	ScruffyChat	so this Fresnel parameter tells Blender:
2016-01-02 04:43:05	Neocraftz1553	mhm
2016-01-02 04:43:14	ScruffyChat	"if you view the water at an oblique angle, it should reflect light. Otherwise, it refracts
2016-01-02 04:43:24	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:43:25	ScruffyChat	And then all that information goes to the Output node
2016-01-02 04:43:35	Neocraftz1553	the material output
2016-01-02 04:43:45	ScruffyChat	right
2016-01-02 04:44:03	ScruffyChat	there's also volume and displacement outputs though
2016-01-02 04:44:24	ScruffyChat	Volume would be if you want to make a cloud, a gas that has continuous substance throughout
2016-01-02 04:44:42	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:44:47	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-02 04:44:54	Neocraftz1553	displacement?
2016-01-02 04:45:25	ScruffyChat	Displacement is a feature where Blender can calculate little bumps on a surface based on its color
2016-01-02 04:45:34	ScruffyChat	without actually changing the geometry
2016-01-02 04:45:39	Neocraftz1553	like?
2016-01-02 04:45:54	Neocraftz1553	which colors are more uh displaced?
2016-01-02 04:45:56	ScruffyChat	well, if you look at any surface it's not perfectly smooth
2016-01-02 04:46:01	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-02 04:46:08	ScruffyChat	an orange for example has bumps on its skin
2016-01-02 04:46:12	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-02 04:46:20	Neocraftz1553	Unless you smooth it out
2016-01-02 04:46:30	ScruffyChat	so if you had a texture for orange skin and linked it to the displacement output
2016-01-02 04:46:42	ScruffyChat	your object would have little orange skin bumps
2016-01-02 04:46:47	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-02 04:47:17	Neocraftz1553	seems pretty cool
2016-01-02 04:47:21	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-02 04:47:27	ScruffyChat	there's a lot you can do with ti
2016-01-02 04:47:29	ScruffyChat	it*
2016-01-02 04:47:34	Neocraftz1553	you are really experienced with blender
2016-01-02 04:47:42	Neocraftz1553	like, reaaaaaallllly
2016-01-02 04:47:57	ScruffyChat	I still have a lot to learn
2016-01-02 04:48:05	ScruffyChat	There's people that could do this in their sleep
2016-01-02 04:48:13	Neocraftz1553	heheh me
2016-01-02 04:48:19	Neocraftz1553	I could dream it
2016-01-02 04:48:26	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-01-02 04:48:31	ScruffyChat	Want me to send you the tree?
2016-01-02 04:48:35	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-02 04:48:48	Neocraftz1553	Torrid desert too would be nice
2016-01-02 04:49:07	Neocraftz1553	might take a few days to study them and such
2016-01-02 04:49:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-02 04:49:56	Neocraftz1553	 300+ on preview sampling makes the grass look nicer
2016-01-02 04:50:03	Neocraftz1553	as well as the bulborb
2016-01-02 04:50:12	Neocraftz1553	but not the pikmin
2016-01-02 04:50:22	Neocraftz1553	well... kinda
2016-01-02 04:50:40	Neocraftz1553	where'd you get the background
2016-01-02 04:51:24	@PikFan	20:48	ScruffyChat	There's people that could do this in their sleep
2016-01-02 04:51:26	Neocraftz1553	just notced the water is the "ground" olimar and the pikmin are standing on
2016-01-02 04:51:32	@PikFan	but Scruffy, you already seem so good at it
2016-01-02 04:51:33	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-02 04:51:39	ScruffyChat	I just looked up spherical 360 panorama backgrounds
2016-01-02 04:51:44	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-02 04:51:47	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-02 04:51:50	ScruffyChat	But for the tree, I have something more complicated
2016-01-02 04:51:58	Neocraftz1553	yeah scruffy, your pretty amazing
2016-01-02 04:51:59	ScruffyChat	Everything about the tree is more complicated
2016-01-02 04:52:05	Neocraftz1553	obviously
2016-01-02 04:52:13	ScruffyChat	thank you
2016-01-02 04:52:31	@PikFan	sorry for butting in, but which tree? the Sunset Islet tree, or another one?
2016-01-02 04:52:43	Neocraftz1553	dont know much about blender, but trees are lots more complicated
2016-01-02 04:52:50	Neocraftz1553	oh sunset isle
2016-01-02 04:52:56	Neocraftz1553	the onion one
2016-01-02 04:52:59	ScruffyChat	He wants to study it
2016-01-02 04:53:01	@PikFan	oh, ok
2016-01-02 04:53:04	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-02 04:53:05	Neocraftz1553	chess
2016-01-02 04:53:14	@PikFan	yeah, trees are always complicated...
2016-01-02 04:53:27	@PikFan	so many tiny parts
2016-01-02 04:53:30	Neocraftz1553	with their leaves and stuff
2016-01-02 04:53:47	Neocraftz1553	I tried to make one with a UV Sphere
2016-01-02 04:54:01	Neocraftz1553	you know, those bushy trees on AC
2016-01-02 04:54:05	Neocraftz1553	animal crossing
2016-01-02 04:54:06	ScruffyChat	There's an addon you should already have in your user preferences
2016-01-02 04:54:15	ScruffyChat	you just have to turn it on
2016-01-02 04:54:19	ScruffyChat	it's called Sapling
2016-01-02 04:54:25	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-01-02 04:54:26	@PikFan	heh, Sapling
2016-01-02 04:54:28	ScruffyChat	it's what I used to make this tree
2016-01-02 04:54:38	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-02 04:54:40	ScruffyChat	albeit, editing the leaves a lot
2016-01-02 04:54:47	@PikFan	wait, was that pun intentional
2016-01-02 04:54:48	Neocraftz1553	let me try it out
2016-01-02 04:55:02	ScruffyChat	but yeah, Sapling can even make a skeleton for the tree and simulate it blowing in the wind
2016-01-02 04:55:08	ScruffyChat	that takes a while though
2016-01-02 04:55:26	Neocraftz1553	woah
2016-01-02 04:56:57	ScruffyChat	Okay, I'm gonna upload it
2016-01-02 04:57:00	ScruffyChat	Might take a bit
2016-01-02 04:57:06	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:57:11	ScruffyChat	And sorry if it crashes Blender for you
2016-01-02 04:57:47	ScruffyChat	But feel free to ask me anything about these renders
2016-01-02 04:57:56	ScruffyChat	anything you're confused about
2016-01-02 04:58:06	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:58:13	Neocraftz1553	its fine if it crashes
2016-01-02 04:58:36	ScruffyChat	But this one should not have any missing textures
2016-01-02 04:58:41	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 04:58:47	ScruffyChat	it has more procedural textures anyway
2016-01-02 04:58:52	ScruffyChat	the leaves are an algorithm
2016-01-02 04:59:33	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-02 05:01:29	Neocraftz1553	how about pellet posies
2016-01-02 05:01:42	ScruffyChat	what do you mean?
2016-01-02 05:01:50	Neocraftz1553	on torrid desert
2016-01-02 05:01:57	Neocraftz1553	howd you make em
2016-01-02 05:02:41	ScruffyChat	Oh, from scratch
2016-01-02 05:02:53	ScruffyChat	actually, I think the pellet was downloaded
2016-01-02 05:03:00	ScruffyChat	because I wanted the right proportions
2016-01-02 05:03:08	ScruffyChat	but then I modeled the flower itself
2016-01-02 05:03:26	ScruffyChat	here's the tree, you can start downloading it here
2016-01-02 05:03:27	ScruffyChat	https://www.dropbox.com/s/m1xrcbjkkuybsgd/SunsetIslet.blend?dl=0
2016-01-02 05:05:43	Neocraftz1553	ok tanks alot
2016-01-02 05:05:50	ScruffyChat	no problemo
2016-01-02 05:06:36	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-02 05:06:41	Neocraftz1553	you were right
2016-01-02 05:06:50	Neocraftz1553	the sunset isle was 109 mb
2016-01-02 05:07:13	Neocraftz1553	might port them to a Flash Drive along with blender later
2016-01-02 05:07:22	ScruffyChat	That's a smart idea
2016-01-02 05:07:43	Neocraftz1553	yes I know... took me days to come up with
2016-01-02 05:07:45	Neocraftz1553	bk
2016-01-02 05:07:48	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-01-02 05:07:55	Neocraftz1553	burger king
2016-01-02 05:07:57	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-02 05:08:01	ScruffyChat	hahaha
2016-01-02 05:08:07	Neocraftz1553	but yeah
2016-01-02 05:08:25	Neocraftz1553	Saves space on my computer without deleting them
2016-01-02 05:08:30	ScruffyChat	right
2016-01-02 05:08:48	ScruffyChat	well
2016-01-02 05:08:56	ScruffyChat	I actually have to get going soob
2016-01-02 05:08:58	ScruffyChat	soon*
2016-01-02 05:09:14	ScruffyChat	Sorry about that, but it's midnight where I am
2016-01-02 05:10:24	ScruffyChat	but if you have any questions about the render or things you find in Blender I'm on this chat pretty often, or you could put it in my talk page and I'd get back to you
2016-01-02 05:10:57	ScruffyChat	Oh, gotta go
2016-01-02 05:11:02	ScruffyChat	Have a good night everyone!
2016-01-02 05:11:07	ScruffyChat	And happy new year

2016-01-02 13:23:37	Yoshi2	hiho Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-02 13:23:38	Testyo	hm, all right, it can extract szs, but can it extract the table: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers#Extensions_of_the_standard_dictionary_numbers
2016-01-02 13:34:45	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-02 13:45:41	Yoshi2	hm, I think the binary search improved the performance a bit
2016-01-02 13:46:17	@Espyo	definitely had to
2016-01-02 13:47:46	Yoshi2	still means that the time complexity is in at least O(nlog(m)) where m is the number of different symbols
2016-01-02 13:48:02	@Espyo	but it's probably the best you can get
2016-01-02 13:56:38	Yoshi2	best would be an O(1) mapping for addresses
2016-01-02 13:57:41	Yoshi2	which I probably could do

2016-01-02 15:09:23	Yoshi2	I discovered that negative bases are a thing and I've been spending the day today doing maths in it
2016-01-02 15:09:46	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-01-02 15:33:56	Yoshi2	as an example, -10 in base -4 is 32 (3*(-4)^1 + 2*(-4)^0 = -10)
2016-01-02 15:34:53	Yoshi2	and 10 in base-4 is 122 (1*(-4)^2 + 2*(-4)^1 + 2*(-4)^0 = 10)
2016-01-02 15:35:05	@Espyo	nuts
2016-01-02 15:35:12	@Espyo	that's actually kinda fun
2016-01-02 15:36:51	Yoshi2	the main difference is the way carrying over digits is done
2016-01-02 15:37:15	Yoshi2	so with the carrying over you get 122+32 = 0

2016-01-03 16:11:35	@Espyo	very few games have managed to hit all of the right buttons for me as Awakening has
2016-01-03 16:11:37	@Espyo	I love it so much
2016-01-03 16:12:34	Yoshi2	I really loved the one on the GBA that was given away in the 3ds ambassador program
2016-01-03 16:12:39	Yoshi2	but that one was also very easy
2016-01-03 16:13:19	@Espyo	I'm glad I got introduced to the series
2016-01-03 16:13:32	@Espyo	a hidden gem I would've passed by if my friends didn't convince me to buy Awakening
2016-01-03 16:13:41	@Espyo	I mean, I would've known about the games from Smash and such
2016-01-03 16:13:44	@Espyo	but playing them is something else
2016-01-03 16:14:25	Yoshi2	I really loved Advance Wars, and FE is quite similar in many aspects
2016-01-03 16:14:56	@Espyo	looks like it, yeah
2016-01-03 16:16:06	Yoshi2	so going from AW to FE was a no-brainer for me
2016-01-03 16:17:10	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-03 16:24:19	<--	M6 (BetaMaster@n-907-82-57-96.hsd9.pa.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: jhi)
2016-01-03 16:25:12	Testyo	oh... right, you have current one or just be an alternate?
2016-01-03 16:30:11	Miles	So yeah
2016-01-03 16:30:14	Miles	Watch Banana Blitz
2016-01-03 16:30:17	Miles	OR ELSE
2016-01-03 16:30:33	Miles	(I haven't come up with what that "or else" is so just watch Banana Blitz)
2016-01-03 16:30:50	@Espyo	seems convincing enough
2016-01-03 16:30:54	Yoshi2	yup
2016-01-03 16:31:09	@Espyo	but first, Splatoon
2016-01-03 16:31:39	Yoshi2	we will all be squids and kids at the splatoon run
2016-01-03 16:31:48	@Espyo	broken squids
2016-01-03 16:31:48	Yoshi2	and then we will eat bananas at the monkeyball run
2016-01-03 16:31:50	@Espyo	broken kids
2016-01-03 16:34:17	@Espyo	stream's already up
2016-01-03 16:35:56	Yoshi2	I have my livestreamer ready \o/
2016-01-03 16:38:29	@Espyo	IJI
2016-01-03 16:38:32	@Espyo	SOMEBODY'S RUNNING IJI
2016-01-03 16:38:34	@Espyo	ahem, sorry
2016-01-03 16:38:42	@Espyo	it's just that Iji is a CRIMINALLY underlooked gem
2016-01-03 16:39:00	Yoshi2	I never heard of Iji
2016-01-03 16:39:12	@Espyo	too bad it's at 6 AM for me
2016-01-03 16:39:20	@Espyo	Iji is a Metroidvania
2016-01-03 16:39:23	@Espyo	that's just... GOOD
2016-01-03 16:39:35	@Espyo	honestly, that's it
2016-01-03 16:39:46	@Espyo	oh, you get different endings depending on how many people you kill
2016-01-03 16:39:54	@Espyo	and has a fair amount of replay value, with easter eggs and all
2016-01-03 16:39:56	@Espyo	it's just GOOD
2016-01-03 16:40:09	Yoshi2	nice
2016-01-03 16:41:33	@Espyo	nice, did you just hear that?
2016-01-03 16:41:51	@Espyo	one of the indie devs took some hours to UNPATCH their game so that an exploit that was removed can be done again for AGDQ
2016-01-03 16:42:26	Yoshi2	yuuup
2016-01-03 16:42:27	Yoshi2	nice
2016-01-03 16:43:59	@Espyo	I love how innovative's AGDQ getting
2016-01-03 16:44:11	@Espyo	this time, runners will be playing Mario Maker levels they haven't seen before
2016-01-03 16:44:24	@Espyo	I still remember the first time the TAS block I was introduced
2016-01-03 16:44:38	@Espyo	"pfft, TAS? please, I've seen so many TAS that I'll happily skip this block, it won't have anything of interest for me"
2016-01-03 16:44:45	@Espyo	"MY LIFE AS I KNOW IT HAS BEEN REWRITTEN"
2016-01-03 16:44:52	Yoshi2	literally
2016-01-03 16:44:56	Yoshi2	rewritten
2016-01-03 16:45:03	@Espyo	literally, yeah
2016-01-03 16:45:39	Yoshi2	sucks that SMM will be at 2 AM my time
2016-01-03 16:45:53	@Espyo	a lot of the best games will be when you and me are asleep
2016-01-03 16:46:03	@Espyo	it's always like that, I'm afraid
2016-01-03 16:46:12	Yoshi2	:(
2016-01-03 16:47:28	@Espyo	if I had a credit card, I'd donate some
2016-01-03 16:47:34	@Espyo	I tried signing up for one at one point
2016-01-03 16:47:51	@Espyo	but they want me to be 26
2016-01-03 16:48:02	@Espyo	although they did say that maaaaaaaaybe they could pull some strings and get me one
2016-01-03 16:48:13	@Espyo	but they rejected anyway because my bank account is barely active
2016-01-03 16:48:23	@Espyo	...maybe it's barely active because I never buy stuff, because I don't have a credit card, ever think of that?
2016-01-03 16:48:24	Yoshi2	that second guy from the right has a huge forehead
2016-01-03 16:48:39	@Espyo	I honestly don't know what kind of weird guidelines they have for allowing somebody to get a credit card
2016-01-03 16:48:47	@Espyo	he does, he looks like he's a midget...

2016-01-03 16:50:31	@Espyo	I want to see this
2016-01-03 16:50:44	@Espyo	this one HAS to reach the donation threshold
2016-01-03 16:50:50	Yoshi2	that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
2016-01-03 16:51:12	@Espyo	what does?
2016-01-03 16:52:09	Yoshi2	<Espyo>  2-player one controller
2016-01-03 16:52:17	@Espyo	hehe, what's so bad about that?
2016-01-03 16:52:20	@Espyo	it's meant to be cumbersome
2016-01-03 16:52:23	@Espyo	that's gonna be the good part
2016-01-03 16:52:40	Yoshi2	two X one Y
2016-01-03 16:53:15	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-03 16:53:20	@Espyo	ok, let's reword it

2016-01-03 16:53:36	@Espyo	wait, that's probably worse
2016-01-03 16:54:46	Yoshi2	let's just leave it at two people one controller
2016-01-03 16:54:54	@Espyo	let's
2016-01-03 16:56:09	Yoshi2	splatoon hype
2016-01-03 16:56:31	@Espyo	oh, I see it's organized differently
2016-01-03 16:56:42	@Espyo	no front couch this time

2016-01-03 16:59:57	@Espyo	there's like this unwritten rule
2016-01-03 17:00:00	@Espyo	that you can host a huge event
2016-01-03 17:00:03	@Espyo	with expensive equipment
2016-01-03 17:00:09	@Espyo	and be doing it for like the 6th year in a row
2016-01-03 17:00:13	@Espyo	and you'll STILL mess it up

2016-01-03 17:35:49	@Espyo	has he made ANY mistake so far?
2016-01-03 17:36:36	Yoshi2	not yet
2016-01-03 17:37:45	@Espyo	this looks like WR material
2016-01-03 17:39:00	Yoshi2	looking very good
2016-01-03 17:39:40	@Espyo	first mistake
2016-01-03 17:40:11	Yoshi2	very risky jumps
2016-01-03 17:40:15	Yoshi2	VERY risky jumps
2016-01-03 17:41:29	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-03 17:45:10	@Espyo	ow my head
2016-01-03 17:45:12	@Espyo	that part was nuts
2016-01-03 17:45:29	Yoshi2	seriously
2016-01-03 17:45:37	Yoshi2	the guy is really on fire right now
2016-01-03 17:45:42	@Espyo	he really is
2016-01-03 17:45:48	@Espyo	excellent start to an AGDQ

2016-01-03 17:53:27	Yoshi2	nice
2016-01-03 17:53:34	@Espyo	it's not a WR
2016-01-03 17:53:39	@Espyo	but DAMN it was close
2016-01-03 17:53:52	Yoshi2	close enough considering he was doing it live
2016-01-03 17:54:11	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-03 17:54:47	@J	I didn't even know Splatoon had 1-player
2016-01-03 17:54:54	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-03 17:54:58	@Espyo	and it's pretty good
2016-01-03 17:57:45	Yoshi2	hype, miles will be next
2016-01-03 17:57:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-03 17:57:55	@Espyo	I won't watch most of it
2016-01-03 17:58:00	@Espyo	I mean, Monkey Ball doesn't mean much to me
2016-01-03 17:58:14	@Espyo	he could be doing something insane, and I won't know if that's a series of 10 frame-perfect tricks in a second
2016-01-03 17:58:25	@Espyo	or if it's an easy move you master in the tutorial
2016-01-03 17:59:33	Yoshi2	indeed
2016-01-03 18:00:09	@Espyo	welp, one of the Inkipedia guys donated 15, with a shout-out to Inkipedia
2016-01-03 18:00:11	@Espyo	but it didn't go through
2016-01-03 18:00:34	@Espyo	oh, I see what the "kill the Yoshis" thing is
2016-01-03 18:00:44	@Espyo	might be that Mario Maker level that Ross made where you have to kill Yoshis to proceed
2016-01-03 18:00:47	@Espyo	...except you don't
2016-01-03 18:00:56	@Espyo	it's possible to complete without a single one dying with some weird exploits
2016-01-03 18:01:13	@Espyo	oh, saw Miles already setting up

2016-01-03 18:22:58	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-03 18:23:17	Yoshi2	this is pretty nice to look at
2016-01-03 18:23:29	Yoshi2	not a perfect run like the splatoon run, but still fun
2016-01-03 18:25:00	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-03 18:26:03	@Espyo	it's a more skilled run, however
2016-01-03 18:26:13	@Espyo	I can imagine myself getting a time within 5-10 minutes of the Splatoon time
2016-01-03 18:26:15	@Espyo	but this game?
2016-01-03 18:26:27	@Espyo	even if I were good, I can't imagine getting a time even twice as long
2016-01-03 18:27:15	Yoshi2	splatoon was very crazy in the last few levels though
2016-01-03 18:28:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-03 18:30:35	Yoshi2	but monkey ball is just non-stop jumps
2016-01-03 18:30:49	Yoshi2	so monkey ball is much easier to mess up
2016-01-03 18:31:35	Yoshi2	the donation reading is pretty genius
2016-01-03 18:31:59	Yoshi2	sometimes the speed runners don't have much to say, so that's a way to fill in the silence

2016-01-03 18:38:33	Yoshi2	this level probably came from hell
2016-01-03 18:38:46	@Espyo	what the hell even was this level
2016-01-03 18:42:17	 *	Yoshi2 claps
2016-01-03 18:42:27	@Espyo	WOW
2016-01-03 18:47:20	@Espyo	here it comes, the janky levels
2016-01-03 18:48:37	Yoshi2	I played the 3ds monkey ball and don't remember that one being as fun as this one

2016-01-03 18:53:00	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that
2016-01-03 18:53:04	@Espyo	but isn't he doing 2 more worlds?
2016-01-03 18:53:22	Yoshi2	oh right
2016-01-03 18:54:20	@Espyo	eep

2016-01-03 18:59:37	Yoshi2	Q&A missed that
2016-01-03 18:59:43	@Espyo	did he just walk in a straight line on that clock hand?
2016-01-03 18:59:47	@Espyo	like it was nothing?
2016-01-03 19:00:03	@Espyo	he was walking so straight I didn't realize it was a moving clock hand till the end
2016-01-03 19:01:29	Yoshi2	pretty nice
2016-01-03 19:01:42	@Espyo	not a bad run
2016-01-03 19:01:46	@Espyo	although it had some hiccups
2016-01-03 19:02:04	@Espyo	still, great display of skill
2016-01-03 19:02:10	@Espyo	and now I'll do something else
2016-01-03 19:02:18	@Espyo	that's two hours of not playing or not developing that I've spent
2016-01-03 19:06:59	Yoshi2	I'll do some more stuff on my thingy

2016-01-03 19:15:18	ScruffyChat	Which one is that?
2016-01-03 19:16:04	Yoshi2	the original (I think?) game from 2001
2016-01-03 19:16:53	ScruffyChat	That game is so great
2016-01-03 19:17:12	ScruffyChat	The campaign is a monster

2016-01-03 19:30:27	Yoshi2	that's three great runs so far that could meet their goal

2016-01-03 19:34:10	@Espyo	with just the craziest things
2016-01-03 19:34:31	@Espyo	honestly, what I saw on that Banana Blitz run wasn't as crazy as some isolated levels I saw here and there
2016-01-03 19:34:37	@Espyo	makes me want to try out the series

2016-01-03 19:42:25	Yoshi2	pretty odd that the developers missed adding collision to the platform in one of the later levels with the pyramid floor
2016-01-03 19:44:49	@Espyo	nice invisible platform too

2016-01-03 20:27:13	Yoshi2	spikevegeta could do a speedrun of watching grass grow and it would sound exciting
2016-01-03 20:32:22	@Espyo	I could swear you landed on the platform, though
2016-01-03 20:32:32	@Espyo	like, I remember thinking you were going to jump straight to the ramp, but you didn't

2016-01-03 21:55:30	ScruffyChat	All the developers who created the stylus mode functionality must have been right-handed
2016-01-03 21:56:05	ScruffyChat	Because it's very clunky left-handed
2016-01-03 21:58:11	ScruffyChat	They should have an option where the right stick moves leaders so the left hand can hold the stylus
2016-01-03 22:05:36	Yoshi2	Espyo: pretty sure he did not land on that particular platform
2016-01-03 22:06:31	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-01-03 22:06:50	@Espyo	yeah, everybody agrees there should be a way to mirror the controls for stylus mode
2016-01-03 22:07:02	@Espyo	Nintendo never was a fan of left-handed people
2016-01-03 22:07:12	@Espyo	they completely mirrored Twilight Princess just to please right-handed people

2016-01-04 20:12:38	@Espyo	but I've seen runs recently, I don't think I'll see any new tricks or anything
2016-01-04 20:13:32	Yoshi2	I think the one I played is different

2016-01-04 20:14:33	@Espyo	SNES has some levels missing
2016-01-04 20:14:39	@Espyo	PC has an extra level compared to Mega Drive

2016-01-04 20:15:11	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure the one I played did not have any levels besides the desert town, or I was so bad I never got past the desert town
2016-01-04 20:16:22	@Espyo	oh, maybe a demo?
2016-01-04 20:18:12	Yoshi2	ok, the PC/DOS version is definitelly a different game than what is being played on AGDQ right now

2016-01-06 19:25:24	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2016-01-06 19:25:25	Testyo	I redid day 10, because somehow the Lesser Mock Bottom wound up in the water is before he tells me how to bake a cake is kinda stupid
2016-01-06 19:29:53	@J	wow
2016-01-06 19:31:15	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-06 19:32:17	Yoshi2	Espyo: did miles say something about the prime run after I left?
2016-01-06 19:32:27	@J	nope
2016-01-06 19:32:57	Yoshi2	aw
2016-01-06 19:48:11	Yoshi2	amnesia and soma were absolutely demolished earlier today
2016-01-06 19:50:05	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-06 19:50:17	@Espyo	I haven't even checked if there's anything good for me today
2016-01-06 19:50:31	@Espyo	not really
2016-01-06 19:50:36	@Espyo	Kaizo starts when I'm starting to head off
2016-01-06 19:50:46	@Espyo	oh wait, it's Kaizo SMB3?
2016-01-06 19:50:53	@Espyo	I never saw any Kaizo that wasn't Super Mario World
2016-01-06 19:54:11	Yoshi2	me neither
2016-01-06 19:55:55	Yoshi2	tomorrow will be awful games done quick
2016-01-06 19:56:04	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-01-06 19:56:40	Yoshi2	but I will be in uni at that time :<

2016-01-06 20:32:36	Yoshi2	those later runs make you appreciate just how smoothly the first few runs of AGDQ went
2016-01-06 20:32:53	@Espyo	what do you mean?

2016-01-06 20:36:54	Yoshi2	the metroid prime run had some trouble mid-run, and the current battletoads run started a bit later because they had to switch NES systems because the game was running at a slightly slower pace than the runner was familiar with

2016-01-06 20:54:01	Scruffy	Hi
2016-01-06 20:54:16	Scruffy	Did you get an email from En_Passant?
2016-01-06 20:54:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-06 20:54:52	@Espyo	replying now
2016-01-06 20:55:23	@Espyo	more than advice, I think he needs words of encouragement right now
2016-01-06 20:55:28	@Espyo	aaand sent
2016-01-06 20:55:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-06 20:57:29	Yoshi2	Espyo: what is up?
2016-01-06 20:57:59	@Espyo	En_Passant's falling behind on his schedule
2016-01-06 20:58:12	@Espyo	and wants words of encouragement and help to get back in line
2016-01-06 20:58:16	Yoshi2	ah
2016-01-06 20:58:23	Yoshi2	schedules are a pain
2016-01-06 20:58:28	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-06 20:58:36	@Espyo	good thing about developing an engine with no schedule
2016-01-06 20:58:44	@Espyo	bad thing is that it takes me 2 years to get like 20% done
2016-01-06 20:59:53	Yoshi2	this mexicanrunner guy is great at battletoads
2016-01-06 21:01:30	@Espyo	not watching, but yeah, it seems like it
2016-01-06 21:01:33	@Espyo	blindfolded... good grief
2016-01-06 21:02:38	Yoshi2	he got pretty far when he did the turbo tunnel blindfolded
2016-01-06 21:06:10	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-06 21:07:18	Yoshi2	but the later parts are not viable without a lot of practice because there are barely any audio clues
2016-01-06 21:08:41	Scruffy	Okay, I sent my words of encouragement
2016-01-06 21:08:56	Scruffy	This semester I'll have more free time to help out with it
2016-01-06 21:09:00	Scruffy	I hope
2016-01-06 21:09:27	Scruffy	Also, I'm planning out a Youtube Series on music theory, composition, and orchestration
2016-01-06 21:09:54	Scruffy	So if any of you guys want to learn about writing music, I can help out!
2016-01-06 21:10:04	@Espyo	heck yes!
2016-01-06 21:10:09	Scruffy	:D
2016-01-06 21:10:35	Scruffy	I'm still writing scripts, and researching, but soon I'll create my first video
2016-01-06 21:10:36	@Espyo	I might have said this before, but at one point, I followed these videos http://www.daveconservatoire.org
2016-01-06 21:10:39	@Espyo	and they're very good
2016-01-06 21:10:41	@Espyo	I learned a lot
2016-01-06 21:10:51	@Espyo	but it's still such a big topic... and I barely have time to learn
2016-01-06 21:10:59	@Espyo	plus it's SO theoretical
2016-01-06 21:11:10	@Espyo	it's hard to talk about music theory without being... theoretical
2016-01-06 21:11:16	Scruffy	Oh yeah, it's definitely theoretical
2016-01-06 21:11:21	@Espyo	but I feel like there's a lot in music that's just "feeling right"
2016-01-06 21:11:28	Scruffy	My first video is going to be "What is music?
2016-01-06 21:11:29	@Espyo	and most people that teach music theory don't approach that front
2016-01-06 21:11:47	@Espyo	it's just "these are scales, these are chords, this is harmony, ..."
2016-01-06 21:11:53	@Espyo	which is important to know, of course
2016-01-06 21:12:01	Scruffy	The thing about music theory is that it's a set of rules people wrote down in the 17th century because there was no standard for music
2016-01-06 21:12:02	@Espyo	but cramming info inside somebody's head is really awful
2016-01-06 21:12:23	Scruffy	Today it's only music in the academic sense, no one follows those rules
2016-01-06 21:12:28	@Espyo	if you can make it more fluid, explain better how some subjects are meant to be and how the feel right, and less about the raw numbers and names, I think people will appreciate it
2016-01-06 21:12:39	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-06 21:12:49	Scruffy	My calculus teacher opened my eyes to this
2016-01-06 21:12:56	@Espyo	yeah, it doesn't look like a lot of people follow music theory
2016-01-06 21:13:02	Scruffy	It's not about the what at all, even in calculus, it's about the why
2016-01-06 21:13:04	@Espyo	well, not "a lot", but you know
2016-01-06 21:13:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-06 21:13:09	@Espyo	exactly
2016-01-06 21:13:16	@Espyo	that's why I ALWAYS hated history
2016-01-06 21:13:19	@Espyo	it's raw remembering
2016-01-06 21:13:21	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-06 21:13:23	@Espyo	at least it was back in the day
2016-01-06 21:13:25	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2016-01-06 21:13:25	@Espyo	this date had this event
2016-01-06 21:13:28	@Espyo	memorize it or fail
2016-01-06 21:13:53	Scruffy	I have a pretty good history class in that regard, it's organized like a seminar where we discuss readings
2016-01-06 21:14:02	Scruffy	The only problem is it jumps all over the place
2016-01-06 21:14:05	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-06 21:14:46	Scruffy	Gotta go
2016-01-06 21:14:48	Scruffy	one more thing
2016-01-06 21:15:22	@Espyo	oh, one thing I notice on people explaining music theory as well
2016-01-06 21:15:31	@Espyo	"this scale is called X, this is Y, this is Z, this is ..."
2016-01-06 21:15:38	@Espyo	you're probably better off explaining the two main scales
2016-01-06 21:15:45	@Espyo	and then point people to the other ones
2016-01-06 21:15:51	@Espyo	same goes for chords and such, really
2016-01-06 21:16:24	Scruffy	I've got a good system I think
2016-01-06 21:16:35	Scruffy	i've been tutoring all semester
2016-01-06 21:16:41	@Espyo	sweet
2016-01-06 21:16:44	@Espyo	I'll be cheering on from here
2016-01-06 21:16:50	Scruffy	Yay! Thanks
2016-01-06 21:16:59	Scruffy	ok, one more thing before I go
2016-01-06 21:17:05	@Espyo	sure
2016-01-06 21:17:35	Scruffy	I'm very confident "Crawmad" comes from the word "Crawdad," which is a slang word for crawfish
2016-01-06 21:17:45	@Espyo	gaaah
2016-01-06 21:17:51	Scruffy	Because that would also explain "Mawdad"
2016-01-06 21:17:52	@Espyo	I knew I had the word "Crawdad" in the back of my mind
2016-01-06 21:18:08	Scruffy	hehe
2016-01-06 21:18:09	@Espyo	but I kept convincing myself "no, you made up that word in your mind, because you're mixing it with the Armored Mawdad"
2016-01-06 21:18:13	@Espyo	good, confirmation!
2016-01-06 21:18:16	@Espyo	thanks, I'll fix it right now
2016-01-06 21:18:24	Scruffy	pleasure to be of service
2016-01-06 21:18:28	Scruffy	I've gotta go
2016-01-06 21:18:32	Scruffy	see ya
2016-01-06 21:18:34	@Espyo	see ya later

2016-01-06 23:06:04	@J	just learned that 'kway' is a valid pronunciation of 'quay' in US English
2016-01-06 23:59:07	@Espyo	just learned what 'quay' means
2016-01-06 23:59:14	@Espyo	quay looks like a proper word
2016-01-06 23:59:20	@Espyo	kinda fits similar words too
2016-01-06 23:59:24	@Espyo	but kway?
2016-01-06 23:59:30	@Espyo	that's just letter vomit
2016-01-06 23:59:45	@Espyo	hey, it uses all three of the "non-traditional" letters for the Portuguese alphabet
2016-01-06 23:59:55	@Espyo	our words don't really have k, w, or y
2016-01-07 00:00:10	@Espyo	but we still know those letters if we need to spell like whisky

2016-01-07 19:44:09	@J	hey, you realise I said proonunciation, not spelling, right?
2016-01-07 19:44:11	@J	(yesterday)
2016-01-07 19:44:39	@J	*pronunciation
2016-01-07 19:46:06	@Espyo	but
2016-01-07 19:46:11	@Espyo	how else would you pronounce it?
2016-01-07 20:24:26	@J	'kee' is just how it's pronounced in England
2016-01-07 20:26:37	@Espyo	that just sounds weird
2016-01-07 20:26:44	@Espyo	looking at the word, at least
2016-01-07 20:38:13	Yoshi2	I'm a sad panda, arookas hasn't yet replied about the addresses of BMS-related commands
2016-01-07 20:38:37	Yoshi2	I might just have to grab SMS and try to figure something out using the snippets of information he made available on his g+ page
2016-01-07 20:39:12	@Espyo	:/
2016-01-07 20:40:27	Yoshi2	I will also need to check which version of SMS he used
2016-01-07 20:40:48	Yoshi2	there are probably differences in the code between PAL and NA
2016-01-07 20:44:43	@Espyo	hmm
2016-01-07 20:44:48	@Espyo	I wouldn't bet on it, but maybe
2016-01-07 20:45:33	Yoshi2	well, cheat codes are usually compatible with one or the other version
2016-01-07 20:45:53	Yoshi2	so there are probably differences in the assembler code due to being different builds
2016-01-07 20:46:32	@Espyo	well, that's just the same things being in different places in RAM
2016-01-07 20:46:44	@Espyo	which is expected
2016-01-07 20:46:50	@Espyo	but the changes don't have to be from the code
2016-01-07 20:47:48	Yoshi2	in most cases, it's safe to say that the changes come from the code
2016-01-07 20:48:32	@Espyo	really? I'd bet harder on resources
2016-01-07 20:50:29	Yoshi2	the pal version might contain fixes the na version doesn't have, or vice versa
2016-01-07 20:50:41	@Espyo	yeah, but how common is that?
2016-01-07 20:50:50	@Espyo	a lot of big Nintendo titles have it
2016-01-07 20:50:59	@Espyo	but everywhere else? I rarely hear it
2016-01-07 20:52:20	Yoshi2	are compilers deterministic, i.e. the same source results in the same compiled code?
2016-01-07 20:52:48	@Espyo	with the same compilers with the same settings, yeah

2016-01-07 20:57:00	Miles	Hi
2016-01-07 20:57:35	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-07 20:57:40	Yoshi2	Espyo: well, I assume it is far more likely that the compiled code is different than if the compiled code was the same between different releases
2016-01-07 20:58:07	@Espyo	maybe
2016-01-07 20:58:15	@Espyo	might depend on the developers, really
2016-01-07 20:59:20	Miles	Btw if any of you didn't watch Punch-Out you're a moron
2016-01-07 20:59:43	@Espyo	I watched what little I could

2016-01-07 20:59:52	@Espyo	wizards, man
2016-01-07 21:01:48	Yoshi2	I watched lots of runs yesterday, but today I was too busy for agdq :/
2016-01-07 21:02:47	@Espyo	moron confirmed
2016-01-07 21:02:54	Yoshi2	yes
2016-01-07 21:02:55	@Espyo	they're actually uploading the runs on youtube after a day or so
2016-01-07 21:03:04	@Espyo	used that to watch the Iji run
2016-01-07 21:03:06	@Espyo	good stuff
2016-01-07 21:03:17	Yoshi2	oh right, I need to check those videos
2016-01-07 21:03:31	@Espyo	uh, I don't know the channel's name from memory
2016-01-07 21:03:37	@Espyo	but on the AGDQ site, go to the FAQ, and it's at the bottom

2016-01-08 19:26:03	Yoshi2	I just realized that the question of whether a specific point in the assembler code is reachable cannot be computed
2016-01-08 19:26:32	Yoshi2	because that's basically like asking if a program terminates
2016-01-08 19:27:21	@Espyo	search for exit()
2016-01-08 19:27:24	@Espyo	or for the end of main()
2016-01-08 19:27:24	@Espyo	:V
2016-01-08 19:27:35	@Espyo	actually...
2016-01-08 19:27:45	@Espyo	would a GameCube piece of software terminate?
2016-01-08 19:27:49	@Espyo	you just power off the machine
2016-01-08 19:29:05	Yoshi2	powering off the machine is cheating though
2016-01-08 19:29:26	Yoshi2	and you cannot say that the program will reach exit() or the end of main()

2016-01-08 23:37:23	@Espyo	remember, chin up
2016-01-08 23:37:27	@Espyo	I'm still here for 20 minutes
2016-01-08 23:37:31	@Espyo	so anything you need to say, I'm right here
2016-01-08 23:38:10	En_Passant	I'm just enjoying some time off for today
2016-01-08 23:38:16	En_Passant	I work 8 hour shifts tomorrow and Sunday
2016-01-08 23:38:27	En_Passant	And have college stuff due next Friday and on the 31st
2016-01-08 23:38:27	Testyo	31 st = 196.859 kg / 434 lb / 6944 oz
2016-01-08 23:38:36	@Espyo	eesh
2016-01-08 23:38:40	@Espyo	college life...
2016-01-08 23:38:41	En_Passant	what is even an st
2016-01-08 23:38:47	@Espyo	stone
2016-01-08 23:38:54	@Espyo	yes, England
2016-01-08 23:38:58	@Espyo	yes, it's stupid
2016-01-08 23:38:58	En_Passant	College apps, I mean
2016-01-08 23:39:08	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-08 23:42:07	En_Passant	I feel like we should keep the 103 run page too, because nobody's going to want to push a Blue Pikmin to the landing site
2016-01-08 23:42:22	@Espyo	I thought that too
2016-01-08 23:42:25	@Espyo	I was conflicted for a bit
2016-01-08 23:42:35	@Espyo	not so much the dragging part as it is the whole exploit part
2016-01-08 23:42:43	@Espyo	people may want to do the lowest possible amount without exploits
2016-01-08 23:42:53	@Espyo	but that's why I added that "General idea" section
2016-01-08 23:43:09	@Espyo	so people can understand what the run is about, and what makes it possible for the 2 Pikmin to be removed compared to a 103 run
2016-01-08 23:43:12	@Espyo	thing is
2016-01-08 23:43:28	@Espyo	the pages are only useful if you're speedrunning a low Pikmin run or if you're casually doing the challenge
2016-01-08 23:43:34	@Espyo	if you're speedrunning, you will want a 103 run
2016-01-08 23:43:41	@Espyo	there's no point in running deprecated categories
2016-01-08 23:43:46	@Espyo	that's your problem if you do
2016-01-08 23:44:00	@Espyo	but if you do know about 103 speedruns and all, you probably know the tricks already, and know how to go to the history and retrieve the page
2016-01-08 23:44:09	@Espyo	plus only like 1 person in the world would ever really want to do it
2016-01-08 23:44:11	@Espyo	...on average
2016-01-08 23:44:13	@Espyo	anyway
2016-01-08 23:44:20	@Espyo	speedrunners will want a 101 run, which is on the wiki
2016-01-08 23:44:30	@Espyo	casual players can do either 103 or 101 in any amount of days
2016-01-08 23:44:36	@Espyo	but for that, they don't need the page at all
2016-01-08 23:44:46	@Espyo	the page is only useful because of the 8 day guide
2016-01-08 23:45:04	@Espyo	other than that, completing the game with 101 or 103 Pikmin without a time limit has nothing to it
2016-01-08 23:45:12	@Espyo	it's like playing normally, except you don't grow more than 101 or 103
2016-01-08 23:45:24	@Espyo	most casual players already pull out 100 Pikmin and use them in caves and the overworld
2016-01-08 23:45:28	@Espyo	so just do that
2016-01-08 23:45:35	@Espyo	but make sure to keep the Pikmin numbers not go above that
2016-01-08 23:45:37	@Espyo	nothing to it
2016-01-08 23:45:46	@Espyo	and if there's a casual player who wants to do 101, the page also explains how
2016-01-08 23:45:52	@Espyo	by having the "general idea" section
2016-01-08 23:45:54	@Espyo	that was my reasoning
2016-01-08 23:46:05	@Espyo	still, I want to, somehow, link to the 103 run...
2016-01-08 23:46:14	@Espyo	I might have an idea
2016-01-08 23:46:19	@Espyo	[[101 Pikmin challenge]]
2016-01-08 23:46:20	Testyo	"101_Pikmin_challenge" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=101_Pikmin_challenge
2016-01-08 23:46:26	@Espyo	just going to open the page real quick so I don't forget later...
2016-01-08 23:47:41	En_Passant	Hm
2016-01-08 23:49:01	En_Passant	Oh, wait, 103 doesn't use Early Blues
2016-01-08 23:49:06	@Espyo	yeah, it doesn't
2016-01-08 23:49:25	@Espyo	actually, let me see what 103 has that's even worth talking about
2016-01-08 23:49:32	@Espyo	like, what separates it from a normal speedrun
2016-01-08 23:49:35	@Espyo	article-wise
2016-01-08 23:50:41	@Espyo	eh, it talks about this or that
2016-01-08 23:52:50	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=101_Pikmin_challenge&curid=20249&diff=158815&oldid=158787 there
2016-01-08 23:52:56	@Espyo	people who want it can find it there
2016-01-08 23:53:03	@Espyo	people who don't want it... it's not bothering them
2016-01-08 23:53:04	@Espyo	so it stays
2016-01-08 23:53:07	@Espyo	solved
2016-01-08 23:53:34	En_Passant	alright
2016-01-08 23:53:50	@Espyo	yeah, feels a bit better to have it there too
2016-01-08 23:53:53	@Espyo	no more weight on my shoulders
2016-01-08 23:54:07	@Espyo	I was on the fence between keeping the page or axing it long after I deleted it

2016-01-09 15:34:21	@Espyo	how so?
2016-01-09 15:34:27	@Espyo	I've seen videos here and there
2016-01-09 15:34:28	@Espyo	seems neat
2016-01-09 15:34:37	ScruffyChat	It has the same sort of geometry creation
2016-01-09 15:34:46	ScruffyChat	You can edit vertices and make crazy shapes
2016-01-09 15:34:46	@Espyo	oh, really?
2016-01-09 15:34:57	@Espyo	I based myself off of Doom
2016-01-09 15:35:06	ScruffyChat	Ah, cool
2016-01-09 15:35:07	@Espyo	but yeah, polygons are so simple but effective
2016-01-09 15:35:13	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2016-01-09 15:35:33	ScruffyChat	I've been trying for probably months now to create Pikmin on Little Big Planet
2016-01-09 15:35:43	ScruffyChat	The only trouble is the AI, it doesn't cooperate
2016-01-09 15:35:51	ScruffyChat	But everything else is pretty straightforward
2016-01-09 15:35:58	@Espyo	aww
2016-01-09 15:36:08	@Espyo	I actually wanted to learn more about how creating in LBP works
2016-01-09 15:36:14	@Espyo	could've helped back when I was working with the AI and such
2016-01-09 15:36:15	ScruffyChat	It's fun
2016-01-09 15:36:21	@Espyo	but now I've settled with a finite state machine
2016-01-09 15:36:24	@Espyo	and there's no going back
2016-01-09 15:36:26	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-09 15:36:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah, there's a cap on the programming, but it's basically game programming with a cuter interface
2016-01-09 15:36:59	ScruffyChat	As much as the PS3 will allow, that is
2016-01-09 15:37:42	ScruffyChat	But I wouldn't recommend Little Big Planet 3 on PS4, the original developers left it and now it's very buggy
2016-01-09 15:37:56	ScruffyChat	They left a dummy texture un-fixed, for crying out loud
2016-01-09 15:38:11	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-09 15:38:31	ScruffyChat	But they made a joke of it, offered a DLC costume with a shirt with the dummy texture on it
2016-01-09 15:38:36	ScruffyChat	Which was pretty funny
2016-01-09 15:39:23	@Espyo	hah
2016-01-09 15:39:29	ScruffyChat	But yeah if I were to recommend one I'd definitely recommend the 2nd one, it allows you to go really far without going too far over your head
2016-01-09 15:39:42	@Espyo	nice
2016-01-09 15:39:43	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2016-01-09 15:39:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-09 15:39:58	ScruffyChat	I've gotta go now
2016-01-09 15:40:05	ScruffyChat	Come Monday I'll have more time to be on here
2016-01-09 15:40:30	ScruffyChat	Ironically that's once the semester begins again
2016-01-09 15:40:35	ScruffyChat	See ya later

2016-01-09 16:00:35	@Espyo	so if you're debugging on visual studio
2016-01-09 16:00:38	@Espyo	windows just goes nuts
2016-01-09 16:00:50	@Espyo	if you try to open, say, a music file with an audio player
2016-01-09 16:01:02	@Espyo	it won't actually send the command until you step when debugging
2016-01-09 16:01:09	@Espyo	and if you press that button that shows you the desktop
2016-01-09 16:01:13	@Espyo	it won't do it until you STOP debugging
2016-01-09 16:02:26	Yoshi2	you could've said "visual studio is nuts" and I would've believed you
2016-01-09 16:02:41	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-09 16:04:54	@J	that sounds amazing
2016-01-09 16:05:20	@Espyo	oh, it didn't this time
2016-01-09 16:05:29	@Espyo	I could start a playlist without problem
2016-01-09 16:05:39	@Espyo	if this was 3 years ago, I would've tried to understand why

2016-01-09 21:05:15	Yoshi2	ooooh, I need to check into the tas bot section
2016-01-09 21:05:35	@Espyo	you missed MK64
2016-01-09 21:05:38	@Espyo	but it wasn't that big of a deal
2016-01-09 21:05:49	@Espyo	I'll have to miss the "total control" thingie
2016-01-09 21:05:54	@Espyo	I'll be playing Smash
2016-01-09 21:10:17	Yoshi2	advance wars music, argghhh
2016-01-09 21:20:50	@J	-10F

2016-01-09 21:25:41	Yoshi2	ok, I forgot which one was the tasbot
2016-01-09 21:46:21	@Espyo	apparently the bottom two
2016-01-09 21:46:29	@Espyo	I missed the intro where they explained the entire gist
2016-01-09 21:46:33	@Espyo	but somebody caught me up
2016-01-09 21:46:38	@Espyo	it's a game made specifically for the event
2016-01-09 21:46:43	@Espyo	the human players had months to practice
2016-01-09 21:46:52	@Espyo	the people who made the two TAS had 4 hours to make the TAS
2016-01-09 21:47:48	@Espyo	what's up with the Brain Age run?
2016-01-09 21:49:46	@Espyo	oh, it's gonna start now
2016-01-09 22:02:14	--	UltraMarioMaker is now known as UltraMario|Nap
2016-01-09 22:13:54	@Espyo	that Brain Age run
2016-01-09 22:14:06	@Espyo	it's amazing how TASBot continues to surprise
2016-01-09 22:18:44	Yoshi2	that was pretty cool, though the gimmick became a bit stale after a while
2016-01-09 22:20:00	@Espyo	a bit
2016-01-09 22:20:13	@Espyo	but they managed to ramp up the interest with some extra meta ones
2016-01-09 22:20:32	Yoshi2	yup
2016-01-09 22:20:37	@Espyo	like the Twitch chat and Rick Roll
2016-01-09 22:20:49	@Espyo	I couldn't hear, but I heard the pen scratching and nothing being drawn
2016-01-09 22:20:54	@Espyo	so the pen probably sung the song

2016-01-09 22:32:45	@Espyo	I tuned out for a bit
2016-01-09 22:32:50	@Espyo	then rewatch it
2016-01-09 22:32:53	@Espyo	is that VANILLA SMB3?
2016-01-09 22:33:01	Yoshi2	real SMB3
2016-01-09 22:33:15	@Espyo	incredible
2016-01-09 22:33:30	@Espyo	how? like SMW?
2016-01-09 22:33:46	@Espyo	using glitches that corrupt the memory?
2016-01-09 22:33:59	Yoshi2	yup
2016-01-09 22:34:12	Yoshi2	kinda similar with setting up the values
2016-01-09 22:37:29	Yoshi2	the gamesdonequick website is rip
2016-01-09 22:38:09	@Espyo	hah
2016-01-09 22:38:25	Yoshi2	I wonder what will be next
2016-01-09 22:38:31	@Espyo	I'm playing Smash
2016-01-09 22:38:35	@Espyo	but I'm taking the time off to check out
2016-01-09 22:38:39	@Espyo	oh, can you warn me when it starts?
2016-01-09 22:38:43	@Espyo	that way I don't have to miss it
2016-01-09 22:38:47	@Espyo	I'll keep this window open
2016-01-09 22:39:02	Yoshi2	I can ping you when the next thing happens, I guess
2016-01-09 22:39:18	Yoshi2	oooo, mystery game
2016-01-09 22:40:21	Yoshi2	Espyo: it starts soon
2016-01-09 22:40:24	@Espyo	thanks
2016-01-09 22:42:02	Yoshi2	off to a good start
2016-01-09 22:42:09	@Espyo	I wonder if it's part of the act...

2016-01-09 22:54:11	@PikFan	got sick after New Year's
2016-01-09 22:54:16	@PikFan	and then school started
2016-01-09 22:54:25	@PikFan	so...yeah
2016-01-09 22:54:52	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-09 22:54:58	@Espyo	well, welcome back
2016-01-09 22:55:01	@Espyo	https://gamesdonequick.com/
2016-01-09 22:55:02	@Espyo	watch this
2016-01-09 22:55:06	@Espyo	get your mind blown
2016-01-09 22:55:50	@PikFan	what am I supposed to be watching? looks like Mario Maker
2016-01-09 22:56:19	@Espyo	that is Super Mario World
2016-01-09 22:56:22	@Espyo	just Super Mario World
2016-01-09 22:56:34	@Espyo	but with its memory corrupted and code re-written mid-playthrough
2016-01-09 22:56:38	@Espyo	to create an entire editor
2016-01-09 22:56:54	@PikFan	is that why blocks are randomly appearing and disappearing
2016-01-09 22:57:03	@PikFan	and other things
2016-01-09 22:57:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-09 22:57:23	@Espyo	they're actually editing
2016-01-09 22:57:25	@Espyo	...kinda brokenly
2016-01-09 22:57:28	@Espyo	not quite sure what went wrong
2016-01-09 22:57:28	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-09 22:57:33	Yoshi2	I think they are trying to allow twitch chat to play the game
2016-01-09 22:57:46	@Espyo	looks like that
2016-01-09 22:57:49	@Espyo	that HAS to be a good idea
2016-01-09 22:58:10	@PikFan	unrelated, but the lottery here in the States is over $900000000
2016-01-09 22:58:11	Testyo	$ 900000000 = 8.2773e+008 € / £ 5.8491e+008 
2016-01-09 22:58:17	@PikFan	highest it's ever been
2016-01-09 22:58:51	@Espyo	good grief
2016-01-09 22:59:16	@PikFan	yup
2016-01-09 22:59:24	@PikFan	of course, nobody actually gets that much
2016-01-09 22:59:34	@PikFan	taxes and such have to be taken out
2016-01-09 22:59:53	@PikFan	in the end, it'll probably be like 2/3 of that
2016-01-09 22:59:56	@PikFan	which is still a lot
2016-01-09 23:01:22	@PikFan	switched back to the bugged SMW stream
2016-01-09 23:01:25	@PikFan	and I see...
2016-01-09 23:01:31	@PikFan	well, I don't know what I see
2016-01-09 23:01:51	@Espyo	they actually rewired the inputs to the twitch chat
2016-01-09 23:02:00	@Espyo	and twitch just broke it
2016-01-09 23:02:11	@PikFan	of course
2016-01-09 23:02:24	@PikFan	what do you expect from insane fans?
2016-01-09 23:02:51	Yoshi2	not necessarily insane
2016-01-09 23:03:00	Yoshi2	just a bug that was overlooked

2016-01-09 23:04:15	@Espyo	neat
2016-01-09 23:04:18	@PikFan	it'll be my first one
2016-01-09 23:04:57	@PikFan	...I think this will be the first time that I won't be playing with unbelievably high-leveled Japanese players... 
2016-01-09 23:05:07	@PikFan	speaking of levels, I'm at level 32 now
2016-01-09 23:06:22	@Espyo	that was fast
2016-01-09 23:06:24	@Espyo	I'm at 36
2016-01-09 23:06:55	@PikFan	oh, so I've gotten slightly better
2016-01-09 23:07:11	@PikFan	for once, I'm not getting horribly demolished in Ranked Battles anymore
2016-01-09 23:07:33	@PikFan	I'm using the .96 Gal Deco in there, with motion controls
2016-01-09 23:07:39	@PikFan	which I've gotten used to by now, yay
2016-01-09 23:07:43	@PikFan	actually, it's funny
2016-01-09 23:08:01	@PikFan	I keep complaining about high-leveled players
2016-01-09 23:08:30	@PikFan	and yet in one Ranked Battle, I splatted people 23 times
2016-01-09 23:08:37	@PikFan	I was amazed
2016-01-09 23:09:28	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-01-09 23:10:25	@Espyo	so you've delved into the dark side...

2016-01-09 23:10:37	@PikFan	hehehehe
2016-01-09 23:10:58	@PikFan	yeah, I've realized how good their offensive capability is
2016-01-09 23:11:17	@PikFan	I still hate splat zones, though
2016-01-09 23:11:26	@PikFan	I only play in rainmaker and tower control
2016-01-09 23:11:59	@PikFan	rainmaker was the one where I got 23 splats
2016-01-09 23:12:10	@PikFan	the stage was Port Mackerel

2016-01-09 23:12:55	@PikFan	yessss
2016-01-09 23:13:01	@PikFan	this person has the right idea
2016-01-09 23:13:22	@PikFan	"However, if we look at Nintendo’s recent past, both the Wii and Wii U were officially unveiled at E3 and did not release until over a year later. We know the NX will be officially unveiled this year, and so if it follows a similar timeline, that would point to a 2017 release."
2016-01-09 23:13:25	@PikFan	exactly
2016-01-09 23:14:39	@Espyo	geez, 23 splats
2016-01-09 23:14:42	@Espyo	you got too good, too fast
2016-01-09 23:14:50	@PikFan	oh no
2016-01-09 23:14:55	@PikFan	I was just plain lucky
2016-01-09 23:15:00	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-09 23:15:26	@PikFan	that was the only time I've gotten 20+ splats
2016-01-09 23:15:40	@PikFan	my average is like... 10?
2016-01-09 23:15:48	@PikFan	but I guess that's still pretty good
2016-01-09 23:15:53	@PikFan	for Ranked, anyway
2016-01-09 23:16:10	@PikFan	in turf wars, I only care about inking as much turf as possible
2016-01-09 23:16:15	@PikFan	so I use the Aerospray
2016-01-09 23:21:05	@PikFan	ok, going with team future
2016-01-09 23:21:19	@PikFan	because they have to have time machines in there so you can go anywhere you want

2016-01-10 14:12:56	@Espyo	looks kind of official, at a glance
2016-01-10 14:15:39	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-01-10 14:16:25	ScruffyChat	I locked the president in one of the alcoves behind a wall, meanwhile some items require three leaders to get

2016-01-10 14:18:49	ScruffyChat	Just wanted to write this as a request for the engine, if you want to include it in the next update
2016-01-10 14:19:28	ScruffyChat	It'd be really neat to have an placeable object that's just a .png texture, no collision
2016-01-10 14:19:42	ScruffyChat	Kinda like how you place shadows but with just regular images
2016-01-10 14:20:06	ScruffyChat	That way you could populate your area with foliage and spice up the ground textures

2016-01-10 14:21:41	@Espyo	and well, you can make ground-like-folliage-like plants too
2016-01-10 14:21:43	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard
2016-01-10 14:39:55	Yoshi2	bloody hell, my internet connection is abysmal today
2016-01-10 14:41:17	Yoshi2	I should yell at my parents again so we can finally get a decent internet connection soon
2016-01-10 14:41:22	@Espyo	it happens
2016-01-10 14:41:25	@Espyo	can't really trust ISPs
2016-01-10 14:41:59	@Espyo	chances are the connection is fine, but your ISP is just "conveniently" having a problem
2016-01-10 14:42:20	Yoshi2	trust me, even if ISPs are shit, the situation I've been in takes the cake
2016-01-10 14:42:20	Testyo	Only Mario Kart Wii can induce such language.
2016-01-10 14:42:38	@Espyo	does it?
2016-01-10 14:42:55	@Espyo	you haven't even disconnected IRC
2016-01-10 14:43:07	Yoshi2	because I use an irc bouncer
2016-01-10 14:43:11	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-01-10 14:49:39	@Espyo	oh, thanks for jinxing me
2016-01-10 14:49:42	@Espyo	now my internet's dying
2016-01-10 14:49:48	Yoshi2	np
2016-01-10 14:49:57	Yoshi2	probably not as bad as what I had today
2016-01-10 14:50:56	@Espyo	well, got fixed right away
2016-01-10 14:50:58	@Espyo	so it can't be worse
2016-01-10 14:52:11	Yoshi2	I have a lot of fun watching my router try to reconnect several times before the connection works again

2016-01-10 15:00:04	Yoshi2	ooooops
2016-01-10 15:00:56	Yoshi2	at least the compiler caught that mistake
2016-01-10 15:04:47	@Espyo	did it? amazing
2016-01-10 15:04:54	@Espyo	so it shot a warning?
2016-01-10 15:08:20	Yoshi2	yup, a warning about the left side of the operation doing nothing
2016-01-10 15:16:10	@J	since I switched to XILO, I've only had one internet outage in the last few years
2016-01-10 15:16:22	@J	and it wasn't a full outage, just randomly losing some packets
2016-01-10 15:16:37	@J	and they noticed it within minutes and put a notice on their website
2016-01-10 15:16:43	@J	and fixed it within hours
2016-01-10 15:16:56	@J	and it turns out it wasn't their fault anyway
2016-01-10 15:18:16	@Espyo	wow
2016-01-10 15:27:09	Yoshi2	I'm suprised how compiler errors are usually not scary
2016-01-10 15:27:32	Yoshi2	start with the topmost error, fix it and chances are, most of the other errors will go away

2016-01-10 19:14:13	Yoshi2	I don't think I've ever had an error like this

2016-01-10 19:18:51	@J	I was 3 years old

2016-01-10 19:19:26	@Espyo	...I thought you were one year older than me, J
2016-01-10 19:19:41	@Espyo	if you're using a makefile, did you include the -g flag?
2016-01-10 19:19:45	Yoshi2	I thought J was 10 years older than Espyo 
2016-01-10 19:19:53	Yoshi2	:I
2016-01-10 19:20:14	@Espyo	I thought that too, waaaaaaay back when

2016-01-10 19:20:44	Yoshi2	I have an idea about what could be the issue
2016-01-10 19:20:53	@Espyo	same here, then...
2016-01-10 19:21:10	Yoshi2	my partner implemented memory allocation strategies in a very inefficient way
2016-01-10 19:21:25	Yoshi2	which makes the entire thing lock up, somehow
2016-01-10 19:21:47	@Espyo	eep
2016-01-10 19:22:05	Yoshi2	inefficient as in
2016-01-10 19:22:50	Yoshi2	to check if there is enough free space, he uses a function that calculates the free space for every offset in the ram
2016-01-10 19:23:10	Yoshi2	and the way the free space is calculated, it does a while loop until it finds memory that is not empty
2016-01-10 19:23:18	@Espyo	that
2016-01-10 19:23:21	@Espyo	really doesn't sound good
2016-01-10 19:23:40	Yoshi2	yup, you get n² time complexity
2016-01-10 19:23:43	Yoshi2	(or close to that)
2016-01-10 19:24:00	Yoshi2	the unit tests do a lot of memory allocation, so that adds up fast
2016-01-10 19:24:07	 *	Yoshi2 sighs
2016-01-10 19:24:16	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-10 19:25:35	@J	I thought I was
2016-01-10 19:25:41	@J	well, I was born right at the start of 1991
2016-01-10 19:25:56	@Espyo	right at the end

2016-01-10 19:27:18	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-01-10 19:27:33	@Espyo	between facebook and skype, I think they're pretty much tied for the one that lets me know the most birthdates
2016-01-10 19:30:00	@J	oh, you know how sometimes random websites you've signed up to will send you birthday emails?

2016-01-10 19:32:31	@J	I guess it still exists, at least

2016-01-10 19:36:28	@J	I know, looks like I actually went through a few games I had and added the scores for them
2016-01-10 19:36:30	@Espyo	yeah, it really seems active
2016-01-10 19:36:38	@Espyo	iid01 is currently one of the best Pikmin runners
2016-01-10 19:43:44	Yoshi2	woohoo, 2 out of 4 mem alloc strategies rewritten to be more linear in time complexity
2016-01-10 19:43:58	@Espyo	yay
2016-01-10 20:00:19	Yoshi2	make that 3 out of 4
2016-01-10 20:09:10	Yoshi2	make that almost 4 out of 4, but there is a bug in the last one :/
2016-01-10 20:29:30	Yoshi2	..... great
2016-01-10 20:30:26	Yoshi2	Espyo: so here's the thing: if I rewrite strat 3 and leave strat 4, then I pass the test. If I rewrite strat 4 and leave strat 3 as is, I pass the unit test
2016-01-10 20:30:34	Yoshi2	but if I rewrite both, it fails the test on strat 4
2016-01-10 20:32:12	Yoshi2	strat 3 being best fit, strat 4 being worst fit
2016-01-10 20:33:21	@Espyo	uhm
2016-01-10 20:34:13	Yoshi2	ok, this is weird, now if I leave strat 3 as is, and rewrite strat 4, it fails
2016-01-10 20:34:26	Yoshi2	I will just leave strat 4 as is and rewrite strat 3, I guess
2016-01-10 20:42:54	Yoshi2	success! Rewriting the functions to be more efficient seems to have helped
2016-01-10 20:45:30	@Espyo	heh

2016-01-10 23:07:31	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-10 23:07:32	@Espyo	sure
2016-01-10 23:08:15	@PikFan	ugh, 2 level 50's...
2016-01-10 23:08:25	@PikFan	hopefully this goes okay

2016-01-10 23:11:51	@PikFan	that inkzooka though
2016-01-10 23:12:18	@Espyo	didn't use it as well as I hoped I would
2016-01-10 23:12:26	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-10 23:15:40	@PikFan	oh, come on
2016-01-10 23:15:41	@Espyo	Gaming98's saying you lagged a bit
2016-01-10 23:15:50	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-01-10 23:15:58	@PikFan	he was warping around a bit
2016-01-10 23:16:11	@Espyo	oh, you disconnected?
2016-01-10 23:16:13	@PikFan	yes
2016-01-10 23:16:28	@Espyo	on purpose?
2016-01-10 23:16:31	@PikFan	no
2016-01-10 23:16:52	@PikFan	but I am going to try out another weapon
2016-01-10 23:21:01	@PikFan	okay, trying the Dual Squelcher
2016-01-10 23:21:09	@PikFan	never used it before, but...
2016-01-10 23:21:24	@PikFan	ugh, my internet's acting up today
2016-01-10 23:21:32	@Espyo	connection's been lost for everybody on that room
2016-01-10 23:21:50	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-10 23:29:18	@PikFan	I think it's reasonable to say I still suck, no?
2016-01-10 23:29:42	@PikFan	and ugh
2016-01-10 23:29:50	@PikFan	I thought I switched my weapon
2016-01-10 23:37:35	@PikFan	ok, I did better that time
2016-01-10 23:37:43	@Espyo	use your weapon's advantage
2016-01-10 23:37:46	@Espyo	that was a squelcher, right?
2016-01-10 23:37:49	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-10 23:37:55	@Espyo	they're good at long distance
2016-01-10 23:37:57	@Espyo	so don't rush in
2016-01-10 23:38:01	@PikFan	yeah

2016-01-11 00:04:32	@Espyo	bed time
2016-01-11 00:04:36	@Espyo	plus the game's doing my head in
2016-01-11 00:04:42	@Espyo	machine gun snipers
2016-01-11 00:04:44	@Espyo	talk about balance
2016-01-11 00:04:59	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-11 00:05:04	@PikFan	so you're frustrated too
2016-01-11 00:05:16	@Espyo	snipers always annoyed me
2016-01-11 00:05:18	@Espyo	they're not well balanced
2016-01-11 00:05:28	@Espyo	but I can always manage to swerve like a sneaky bastard
2016-01-11 00:05:36	@Espyo	and always manage to sneak up behind them and make them regret their choices
2016-01-11 00:05:39	@Espyo	but this guy?
2016-01-11 00:05:50	@Espyo	he could fire like one killing shot per second
2016-01-11 00:05:51	@Espyo	that's...
2016-01-11 00:05:57	@Espyo	RIDICULOUSLY HIGH
2016-01-11 00:06:10	@Espyo	the point of a sniper is to be able to hit from a distance and instakill at the cost of taking a while to charge
2016-01-11 00:06:12	@Espyo	it's high commitment
2016-01-11 00:06:20	@Espyo	you dedicate your time to charging this shot, in the payoff that it hits
2016-01-11 00:06:26	@Espyo	where's the balance if it doesn't have a downside?
2016-01-11 00:06:38	@Espyo	plus some people are just too tryhard and play this game like it's their blood and oxygen
2016-01-11 00:06:39	@PikFan	I hate snipers in ranked mode
2016-01-11 00:06:49	@Espyo	this guy was able to hit me no matter how sneaky I was
2016-01-11 00:07:00	@Espyo	I haven't touched ranked in like 4 months
2016-01-11 00:07:04	@PikFan	they just perch themselves on some high place and snipe at you like it's a piece of cake
2016-01-11 00:07:04	@Espyo	it can rot in hell as far as I care
2016-01-11 00:07:16	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-11 00:07:19	@PikFan	that bad, huh
2016-01-11 00:07:23	@Espyo	if it weren't so late, I'd have quit the game sooner and gone on Smash instead
2016-01-11 00:07:27	@Espyo	I only have so many years to live
2016-01-11 00:07:34	@Espyo	I don't want to spend any time doing something that's not good
2016-01-11 00:07:39	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-11 00:07:40	@Espyo	if I'm getting upset at this unbalanced game and not having fun
2016-01-11 00:07:47	@Espyo	then I'm scramming the hell out of there
2016-01-11 00:08:04	@PikFan	right
2016-01-11 00:08:15	@PikFan	okay, so this one guy had a roller
2016-01-11 00:08:17	@PikFan	and ugh
2016-01-11 00:08:29	@PikFan	he just kept popping out of nowhere and kept splatting me
2016-01-11 00:08:31	@PikFan	over and over
2016-01-11 00:08:42	@PikFan	and he was also spamming burst bombs and the inkzooka
2016-01-11 00:08:50	@PikFan	and I'm like wow
2016-01-11 00:09:26	@PikFan	was the sniper guy a Japanese player?
2016-01-11 00:09:30	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-11 00:09:33	@PikFan	figures
2016-01-11 00:09:34	@Espyo	yeah, that roller's been annoying me too
2016-01-11 00:09:42	@Espyo	the thing with the Carbon Roller is that it's meant to be very close range
2016-01-11 00:09:50	@Espyo	but this guy somehow manages to hit brilliantly at mid range
2016-01-11 00:10:19	@PikFan	the reason why I'm excited for splatfest is because I won't have to play with any Japanese players
2016-01-11 00:10:41	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-01-11 00:10:45	@PikFan	they're just... so pro
2016-01-11 00:11:06	@PikFan	they know everything
2016-01-11 00:11:40	@PikFan	I keep ragequitting because of them
2016-01-11 00:12:01	@PikFan	and it especially sucks because all my groups are mostly made of Japanese players
2016-01-11 00:12:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-11 00:12:29	@PikFan	like, where are all the other American or European players?
2016-01-11 00:12:32	@PikFan	it drives me nuts

2016-01-11 19:09:30	@Espyo	so, I brainstormed a bit
2016-01-11 19:09:44	@Espyo	I'll create creator tools
2016-01-11 19:09:54	@Espyo	that will, amongst other things, allow you to take a screenshot of the entire level in-game
2016-01-11 19:10:03	@Espyo	so people don't have to take screenshots of the tiny editor, textures only
2016-01-11 19:10:28	ScruffyChat	Ah, neat!
2016-01-11 19:10:44	ScruffyChat	Oh, I'll be on a lot more from now on

2016-01-11 19:11:17	@Espyo	when your schedule for the semester actually makes sense
2016-01-11 19:11:41	@Espyo	and then you go to the next semester and monday has 3 classes spanning the whole day with 2 hour breaks between

2016-01-11 19:14:03	@Espyo	if you need one, let me know
2016-01-11 19:14:07	@Espyo	...but sharing all of them will take years
2016-01-11 19:14:11	ScruffyChat	Ok thanks!
2016-01-11 19:14:17	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that makes sense

2016-01-11 19:18:06	ScruffyChat	I've been considering making some HD custom textures for Pikmin and Pikmin 2 using Blender
2016-01-11 19:18:11	ScruffyChat	But it'd take a while

2016-01-11 19:18:25	@Espyo	it sure would
2016-01-11 19:18:49	ScruffyChat	I'm just trying the HUD of Pikmin so far, enhancing all the little bubbles and icons
2016-01-11 19:18:54	@Espyo	oh, your suggestion from before of adding objects to the level that serve as shrubbery?
2016-01-11 19:18:59	@Espyo	plants are planned, and they'll come soon
2016-01-11 19:19:03	ScruffyChat	Yay!
2016-01-11 19:19:11	@Espyo	but the creator can make whatever plant they want, even a stubby grass texture
2016-01-11 19:19:19	@Espyo	and I'll also make it so people can add any OBJECT
2016-01-11 19:19:23	@Espyo	an object of no particular kind
2016-01-11 19:19:26	@Espyo	it can do whatever, with scripting
2016-01-11 19:19:31	@Espyo	so... should be good
2016-01-11 19:19:35	ScruffyChat	Yeah!
2016-01-11 19:19:49	ScruffyChat	I was having trouble considering how the plant thing would work
2016-01-11 19:20:05	ScruffyChat	Because some plants are obviously shorter than Pikmin
2016-01-11 19:20:12	ScruffyChat	And some are taller
2016-01-11 19:20:15	@Espyo	honestly, I'm only going to make plants be their own thing because people might want plants to be recognizable on the Piklopedia
2016-01-11 19:20:22	@Espyo	otherwise they'd be just plain old unspecified objects
2016-01-11 19:20:22	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-11 19:20:35	@Espyo	I THINK I already made it so that tall things appear on top of small things on the engine
2016-01-11 19:20:51	@Espyo	but yeah, since it's top-down, making tall plants will look a bit funky
2016-01-11 19:20:53	ScruffyChat	Oh near
2016-01-11 19:20:55	ScruffyChat	neat*
2016-01-11 19:20:56	@Espyo	just a matter of experimenting, I guess
2016-01-11 19:20:59	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-11 19:21:27	ScruffyChat	It's great so far, creating areas is so much fun
2016-01-11 19:23:57	@Espyo	thanks
2016-01-11 19:24:24	@Espyo	I can only trust it'll be better when I add plants, water, and some ambiance particles
2016-01-11 19:25:45	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-11 19:26:01	ScruffyChat	But already you can get some good puzzles out of it

2016-01-11 23:04:29	@Espyo	I... I think I did it
2016-01-11 23:04:39	@Espyo	I finally wrote a wall sliding algorithm that works
2016-01-11 23:04:42	Neocraftz1553	I was going to ask something but I forgot
2016-01-11 23:04:51	@Espyo	it doesn't work that well if you're walking against a "spike"
2016-01-11 23:04:53	@Espyo	but everything else... works
2016-01-11 23:04:59	@Espyo	when it used to not work because of this or that
2016-01-11 23:05:06	@Espyo	I'm not quite sure how to feel now
2016-01-11 23:05:52	ScruffyChat	Hello
2016-01-11 23:06:02	ScruffyChat	Oh, great!
2016-01-11 23:06:15	Neocraftz1553	what
2016-01-11 23:06:35	ScruffyChat	Espyo wrote a matured wall collision algorithm
2016-01-11 23:06:47	Neocraftz1553	for what
2016-01-11 23:06:50	@Espyo	the engine
2016-01-11 23:07:00	Neocraftz1553	oh thats cool!
2016-01-11 23:07:18	@Espyo	finally, walls won't be so sticky
2016-01-11 23:07:22	@Espyo	you can actually slide off of them
2016-01-11 23:07:28	@Espyo	the big problem isn't getting the leaders to slide off walls
2016-01-11 23:07:35	@Espyo	if the player gets stuck, they can get themselves unstuck just fine
2016-01-11 23:07:38	@Espyo	the problem is Pikmin following behind
2016-01-11 23:07:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-11 23:07:48	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah
2016-01-11 23:08:24	Neocraftz1553	had that problem when they're carrying something and then you try to whistle them back next to a wall
2016-01-11 23:08:40	@Espyo	hmm, that might be a bigger problem
2016-01-11 23:08:45	@Espyo	that's them actually getting stuck inside the wall
2016-01-11 23:08:45	Neocraftz1553	you kinda have to switch between pikmin
2016-01-11 23:08:48	@Espyo	but it should be removed now
2016-01-11 23:09:25	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-01-11 23:09:29	@Espyo	ok, let me just write down the current algorithm here
2016-01-11 23:09:33	@Espyo	so I'll at least have it somewhere
2016-01-11 23:09:36	@Espyo	because I'm going to do cleanup now
2016-01-11 23:09:41	Neocraftz1553	lol yeah
2016-01-11 23:09:42	@Espyo	and chances are I'll destroy something important
2016-01-11 23:09:45	@Espyo	ok, so
2016-01-11 23:09:56	@Espyo	when a mob moves, we check all walls in the part of the map the mob is on
2016-01-11 23:10:03	@Espyo	well, all polygon edges
2016-01-11 23:10:16	@Espyo	if this polygon edge is a wall, that means there's a collision
2016-01-11 23:10:30	@Espyo	save all edges that the mob collides with
2016-01-11 23:11:17	@Espyo	if an edge isn't a wall, discard it
2016-01-11 23:11:22	@Espyo	like, the floor on both sides is the same
2016-01-11 23:11:31	@Espyo	it's like it's just a line on the floor, it's not really a wall
2016-01-11 23:12:08	@Espyo	at the same time, if the mob is inside any floor that's within stair-stepping height, it should step up
2016-01-11 23:12:31	@Espyo	for every wall in which there's an intersection, find the angle the mob should slide towards, considering the direction it was trying to go in
2016-01-11 23:12:39	@Espyo	if the wall is facing backwards, it's impossible, so discard the wall
2016-01-11 23:12:58	@Espyo	if the wall's floors are above the mob, that means that this wall is poking through the mob, but it's not actually a wall we should bother colliding with
2016-01-11 23:13:14	@Espyo	finally, of all possible slide angles, slide on the one that causes the biggest difference
2016-01-11 23:13:23	@Espyo	there, now if I need to look back, I have this chatlog
2016-01-11 23:14:24	Neocraftz1553	so scruffy
2016-01-11 23:14:45	Neocraftz1553	I think your new map is awsome
2016-01-11 23:14:57	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2016-01-11 23:14:58	@Espyo	oh, Neo
2016-01-11 23:15:02	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-11 23:15:03	@Espyo	I told Scruffy this but not you
2016-01-11 23:15:09	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-11 23:15:10	@Espyo	I'll add some creator tools for the next release
2016-01-11 23:15:17	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-01-11 23:15:18	@Espyo	which include the ability to take a screenshot of the entire area
2016-01-11 23:15:23	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-01-11 23:15:26	@Espyo	so you don't have to take a tiny screenshot of the editor
2016-01-11 23:15:29	Neocraftz1553	thats cool
2016-01-11 23:15:30	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-11 23:15:43	Neocraftz1553	with my extremely advanced method
2016-01-11 23:16:03	ScruffyChat	Oh, one suggestion for you Espyo
2016-01-11 23:16:22	ScruffyChat	Change the title screen background to a .png image
2016-01-11 23:16:35	ScruffyChat	Up until now I didn't know there was supposed to be a background in the title screen
2016-01-11 23:16:53	@Espyo	oh right, because Mac doesn't like .jpg on the engine, right...
2016-01-11 23:16:58	@Espyo	well, I had it as a png
2016-01-11 23:17:07	@Espyo	but that image as a png is like EIGHT times larger
2016-01-11 23:17:20	@Espyo	pngs should only really be used if there's to be transparency
2016-01-11 23:17:24	@Espyo	or it's something that's meant to look crisp
2016-01-11 23:17:32	@Espyo	the title screen, regardless of what game you make, isn't really the case, ever
2016-01-11 23:17:33	@Espyo	so I chose jpg
2016-01-11 23:17:36	@Espyo	this is hardcoded
2016-01-11 23:17:43	@Espyo	and changing it has its consequences, of course...
2016-01-11 23:17:57	@Espyo	please remind me tomorrow to create a quick test program
2016-01-11 23:18:04	@Espyo	where I load a jpg and draw it
2016-01-11 23:18:08	ScruffyChat	Ok no problem!
2016-01-11 23:18:10	@Espyo	and you can tell me if it shows on Mac or not
2016-01-11 23:18:15	@Espyo	if not, we'll raise this issue with the Allegro developers
2016-01-11 23:18:34	@Espyo	if it does show... then this is going to be another mipmap-zoom-OpenGL fiasco
2016-01-11 23:18:37	ScruffyChat	Finally I can come back tomorrow without too much work to detract me
2016-01-11 23:18:44	@Espyo	feels good, eh?
2016-01-11 23:18:49	ScruffyChat	Yesss
2016-01-11 23:19:08	Neocraftz1553	oh, yeah, scruffy, how did you do the awakening wood pulp image
2016-01-11 23:19:20	ScruffyChat	That was pretty difficult
2016-01-11 23:19:31	ScruffyChat	I had the model of the Awakening Wood and all its textures (and glory)
2016-01-11 23:19:43	Neocraftz1553	me too
2016-01-11 23:19:56	ScruffyChat	And I had to go through and, one by one, change each texture to a solid color that best represented that material
2016-01-11 23:20:06	Neocraftz1553	ooh
2016-01-11 23:20:18	Neocraftz1553	seems so simple, yet pretty hard to do
2016-01-11 23:21:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-11 23:21:40	Neocraftz1553	im trying to remember the question I was trying to ask...
2016-01-11 23:21:50	Neocraftz1553	it was important too
2016-01-11 23:22:43	ScruffyChat	was it blender related?
2016-01-11 23:22:47	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-11 23:24:19	Neocraftz1553	let me see...
2016-01-11 23:24:49	Neocraftz1553	oh I think I remember
2016-01-11 23:25:42	Neocraftz1553	How do you have different colors on the same mesh? like the pikmin enemy models?
2016-01-11 23:25:52	Neocraftz1553	and the pikmin eyes
2016-01-11 23:30:28	Neocraftz1553	sorry for always asking you questions about blender so much, your just the only guy I know who knows this stuff.

2016-01-11 23:40:49	Neocraftz1553	AND I thought it was in the bottem left corner
2016-01-11 23:40:55	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-11 23:41:11	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, the background never showed up for me
2016-01-11 23:41:40	Neocraftz1553	did you check the extension, made sure it was right?
2016-01-11 23:41:58	@Espyo	you mean the cave background, or the sketch background?
2016-01-11 23:42:01	@Espyo	I should REALLY name them different things
2016-01-11 23:42:08	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-11 23:42:14	@Espyo	one thing is what you set up on the area's text file, which is the area background
2016-01-11 23:42:20	@Espyo	it's like the steel walls you see in some Pikmin 2 caves
2016-01-11 23:42:29	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-11 23:42:32	@Espyo	another thing is a sketch you can impose on top of the area editor to guide you with your sketches
2016-01-11 23:42:39	@Espyo	so... which of the two did you mean, Scruffy?
2016-01-11 23:42:50	Neocraftz1553	the cave background sounds neat
2016-01-11 23:42:58	@Espyo	it should be working already
2016-01-11 23:43:05	Neocraftz1553	even though I have no Idea what it is
2016-01-11 23:43:07	@Espyo	with depth and all
2016-01-11 23:43:16	Neocraftz1553	in the new version?
2016-01-11 23:43:23	@Espyo	since quite a few versions
2016-01-11 23:43:27	@Espyo	I remember developing that like a year ago
2016-01-11 23:43:30	@Espyo	but I never looked at it again
2016-01-11 23:43:34	@Espyo	so maybe it broke again :S
2016-01-11 23:43:41	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-11 23:44:04	ScruffyChat	Oh, neither
2016-01-11 23:44:20	ScruffyChat	I tried the cave background and made sure the file names matched
2016-01-11 23:44:38	@Espyo	neither?
2016-01-11 23:44:40	ScruffyChat	And the bg button did not seem to change anything
2016-01-11 23:45:02	Neocraftz1553	Ill try to usw a background right now
2016-01-11 23:45:09	@Espyo	oh, you won't see the cave background (to disambiguate: I mean the thing like the steel walls) on the editor
2016-01-11 23:45:12	@Espyo	you'll only see it in-game
2016-01-11 23:45:16	Neocraftz1553	let me just boot up ma trusteh laptop
2016-01-11 23:45:18	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: it's on the tutorial somewhere

2016-01-11 23:46:01	Neocraftz1553	I need to study the tutorial thoroughly
2016-01-11 23:46:06	@Espyo	if you want
2016-01-11 23:46:11	Neocraftz1553	I think I misspelled it
2016-01-11 23:46:13	@Espyo	I tried to make it so you should read it all
2016-01-11 23:46:16	Neocraftz1553	but whatever
2016-01-11 23:46:19	@Espyo	but you can also check specific sections

2016-01-11 23:55:43	ScruffyChat	When your working on a mesh and you switch to Edit Mode
2016-01-11 23:55:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-11 23:56:08	ScruffyChat	A group of options appears near the top of the Materials properties panel
2016-01-11 23:56:17	ScruffyChat	One of these new options is called Assign
2016-01-11 23:56:37	ScruffyChat	With it you can select faces on the mesh and assign them to a specific material
2016-01-11 23:56:56	ScruffyChat	With the plus and minus buttons you can put multiple materials in the menu of one object
2016-01-11 23:57:08	ScruffyChat	And assign vertices to certain ones
2016-01-11 23:58:24	Neocraftz1553	ooh

2016-01-12 00:01:52	@Espyo	there's a plugin for GIMP that turns textures seamless
2016-01-12 00:01:59	@Espyo	it kinda morphs them and blend them until they become seamless
2016-01-12 00:02:02	@Espyo	anyway, going now

2016-01-12 00:17:09	@PikFan	okay
2016-01-12 00:17:25	@PikFan	barely anyone's still reviewed Chapter 5, though
2016-01-12 00:17:32	@PikFan	much to my extreme disappointment
2016-01-12 00:17:46	ScruffyChat	Aww
2016-01-12 00:17:50	@PikFan	I can't blame them though
2016-01-12 00:18:07	@PikFan	why should they be interested in something that hasn't been updated in half a year?
2016-01-12 00:18:17	@PikFan	it's only natural for them to lose faith and interest
2016-01-12 00:18:41	@PikFan	at the same time though... I feel a pang of... I dunno, betrayal, I suppose?
2016-01-12 00:18:56	ScruffyChat	Man, that's true
2016-01-12 00:19:01	@PikFan	that is, my expectations were betrayed
2016-01-12 00:19:04	ScruffyChat	Sorry I haven't reviewed it officially
2016-01-12 00:19:10	ScruffyChat	Only offering comments on here
2016-01-12 00:19:18	@PikFan	oh no, it's fine
2016-01-12 00:19:20	ScruffyChat	It does deserve review though, I think
2016-01-12 00:19:25	@PikFan	I agree
2016-01-12 00:19:30	@PikFan	but there has to be interest
2016-01-12 00:19:31	ScruffyChat	It's a great piece of fanfiction
2016-01-12 00:19:44	@PikFan	and the only way people will be interested if it's updated frequently
2016-01-12 00:19:46	@PikFan	and I...
2016-01-12 00:19:56	@PikFan	well
2016-01-12 00:20:10	@PikFan	ideally, I'd be getting at least a chapter per month, hopefully more
2016-01-12 00:21:00	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-12 00:21:09	@PikFan	maybe the exposition is off-putting to some
2016-01-12 00:21:34	@PikFan	the exposition covers the first three chapters
2016-01-12 00:21:34	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-12 00:21:53	@PikFan	(I am using exposition correctly, right?)
2016-01-12 00:22:17	ScruffyChat	You mean the prologue? Or the exposition offered /by/ the first three chapters
2016-01-12 00:22:32	@PikFan	both
2016-01-12 00:22:39	ScruffyChat	Exposition is introduction of setting and characters
2016-01-12 00:22:45	ScruffyChat	And I don't feel it's off putting
2016-01-12 00:22:50	ScruffyChat	I thought it was enticing
2016-01-12 00:22:54	@PikFan	hm, alright
2016-01-12 00:23:08	ScruffyChat	particularly the inside of the Onion, that was awesome
2016-01-12 00:23:32	@PikFan	heh, thanks
2016-01-12 00:24:04	@PikFan	oh, also
2016-01-12 00:24:16	@PikFan	last night, I had an idea for a new fanfiction
2016-01-12 00:24:37	@PikFan	well, two, actually
2016-01-12 00:24:42	ScruffyChat	Woah 
2016-01-12 00:24:47	ScruffyChat	Tell. me. everything.
2016-01-12 00:25:09	@PikFan	if you insist
2016-01-12 00:25:16	ScruffyChat	Your fanfic ideas are great
2016-01-12 00:25:30	@PikFan	thanks
2016-01-12 00:25:41	@PikFan	the first one is based off of Pikmin 1
2016-01-12 00:25:54	@PikFan	and the idea that Captain Olimar fails to escape
2016-01-12 00:26:07	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-12 00:26:15	@PikFan	the second one is similar, except it's with Pikmin 3 and the Koppaites
2016-01-12 00:26:26	@PikFan	thought that one has a bit more options
2016-01-12 00:26:28	ScruffyChat	failing to escape?
2016-01-12 00:26:32	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-12 00:26:40	ScruffyChat	aww neat
2016-01-12 00:26:45	ScruffyChat	That is cool
2016-01-12 00:26:50	@PikFan	with Pikmin 3, there's more options
2016-01-12 00:26:55	ScruffyChat	yeah
2016-01-12 00:27:06	@PikFan	they could fail to get the cosmic-drive key and remain stranded on the planet
2016-01-12 00:27:07	@PikFan	or
2016-01-12 00:27:29	@PikFan	get the cosmic-drive key, but only secured a limited amount of fruit
2016-01-12 00:27:52	ScruffyChat	and then you'd tell what happened on Koppai afterwards?
2016-01-12 00:27:56	@PikFan	yup
2016-01-12 00:28:24	ScruffyChat	neato
2016-01-12 00:28:27	@PikFan	it'd actually be my first time writing from the POV of non-Pikmin characters
2016-01-12 00:28:52	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-01-12 00:29:06	ScruffyChat	Yeah, with the non-Pikmin characters, you have to be more careful with characterization
2016-01-12 00:29:13	ScruffyChat	They can't just be anyone you want them too
2016-01-12 00:29:15	ScruffyChat	to*

2016-01-12 00:31:29	ScruffyChat	You could bring your stories to life
2016-01-12 00:31:34	@PikFan	I want to learn how to draw anime-style characters
2016-01-12 00:31:51	@PikFan	I've always been obsessed with the idea of a Pikmin anime
2016-01-12 00:32:03	@PikFan	...but it's practically nonexistent
2016-01-12 00:32:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah, it seems like an easy match
2016-01-12 00:32:21	ScruffyChat	Especially with Pikmin 3's batch of characters
2016-01-12 00:32:33	@PikFan	the battle in Chapter 5 was actually inspired by fights in anime
2016-01-12 00:32:42	ScruffyChat	I have no idea how to draw anime characters though
2016-01-12 00:32:46	@PikFan	heh, same here
2016-01-12 00:32:53	ScruffyChat	I only draw cartoons
2016-01-12 00:32:57	@PikFan	right
2016-01-12 00:33:05	@PikFan	speaking of, how's the Blues Pikmin going?
2016-01-12 00:33:21	ScruffyChat	Good, he has a Red Pikmin on keys and a Purple Pikmin on bass now
2016-01-12 00:33:47	@PikFan	I'm hyped
2016-01-12 00:33:47	ScruffyChat	I don't know who'll be on drums, but they can't exactly fit in the view I have right now, I've gotta think how I'm going to do that

2016-01-12 00:35:57	@PikFan	yeah

2016-01-12 00:37:43	ScruffyChat	By the way, I know we discussed this briefly before, but how do you envision these Red Pikmin characters when you write them?
2016-01-12 00:38:01	ScruffyChat	Do they have individual differences or are they all identical like in the gaems?
2016-01-12 00:38:03	ScruffyChat	games*
2016-01-12 00:38:26	@PikFan	oh, no, you're not obligated to make a battle scene at all, it'd be far too much work
2016-01-12 00:38:45	@PikFan	we both know how long it took to render An Excerpt
2016-01-12 00:39:00	@PikFan	and about envisioning: I... don't know

2016-01-12 00:39:38	@PikFan	Amber, Ruby, and Flare have flowers
2016-01-12 00:39:54	@PikFan	but Ruby is bright red, unlike the other Red Pikmin
2016-01-12 00:40:01	ScruffyChat	oooh
2016-01-12 00:40:31	@PikFan	and I decided that if I ever do draw them, I'll include mouths
2016-01-12 00:40:40	@PikFan	even though that's not real
2016-01-12 00:40:46	@PikFan	but eh

2016-01-12 00:41:04	@PikFan	yup
2016-01-12 00:42:45	ScruffyChat	Well don't beat yourself up over your pace; take your time to ensure the quality, and then when you have a nice lengthy juicy story, it'll get plenty popular
2016-01-12 00:43:44	ScruffyChat	at least that's how I try to justify taking so long with the Louie story

2016-01-12 00:48:11	ScruffyChat	It would all leave Louie such a sad character
2016-01-12 00:48:23	ScruffyChat	More brain food for the Titan Dweevil
2016-01-12 00:49:32	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-12 00:49:38	@PikFan	that's true
2016-01-12 00:50:00	@PikFan	well... perhaps his mom's just on an extended vacation?

2016-01-12 00:50:20	ScruffyChat	My other options are that his mother didn't want children, or some other argument that made her leave when Louie was born
2016-01-12 00:50:34	ScruffyChat	She could be on extended vacation but it'd have to be really really extended
2016-01-12 00:50:40	ScruffyChat	For them to fall out of communicatio
2016-01-12 00:50:42	ScruffyChat	n
2016-01-12 00:51:31	@PikFan	I guess
2016-01-12 00:52:05	ScruffyChat	I don't know, maybe she is still fine, and she just wasn't brought up for the whole of Pikmin 2
2016-01-12 00:52:30	ScruffyChat	It's just weird that his /grandmother/ sends him letters if he has a mother who's equally worried
2016-01-12 00:52:41	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-12 00:53:48	ScruffyChat	Based on the context clues, his mom wasn't around when he was growing up
2016-01-12 00:54:13	ScruffyChat	And she wouldn't go on vacation from raising her child unless she wants nothing to do with Louei
2016-01-12 00:54:58	ScruffyChat	Perhaps Louie's dad surprises her by adopting Louie, and she gets really mad
2016-01-12 00:55:17	ScruffyChat	Which would leave Louie in an awkward position but not as bad
2016-01-12 00:55:20	ScruffyChat	I guess
2016-01-12 00:55:58	ScruffyChat	I dunno, it's weird to write about this, I'm stretching to the very limits of the canon material
2016-01-12 00:56:02	@PikFan	hmmm.......
2016-01-12 00:56:30	ScruffyChat	But Louie's life must be recorded!
2016-01-12 00:56:41	@PikFan	yes
2016-01-12 00:57:58	ScruffyChat	I'll think of something
2016-01-12 00:58:05	ScruffyChat	Would you like to read it so far?
2016-01-12 00:58:16	ScruffyChat	I've got more progress on it, and your my best editor

2016-01-12 01:03:22	@PikFan	(the cake)
2016-01-12 01:03:41	@PikFan	but no, I thought it was cute
2016-01-12 01:03:56	ScruffyChat	Heh

2016-01-12 01:04:03	ScruffyChat	It's my first time writing romance
2016-01-12 01:07:57	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-12 01:08:22	@PikFan	I'm sorry, I'm reading a fanfic right now
2016-01-12 01:08:27	@PikFan	it's just... so good
2016-01-12 01:09:10	ScruffyChat	Oooh what is it?
2016-01-12 01:09:41	@PikFan	it's about Splatoon

2016-01-12 01:10:42	ScruffyChat	Haha, already
2016-01-12 01:10:50	En_Passant	no profanity is terrible
2016-01-12 01:10:52	ScruffyChat	Hello En_Passant!
2016-01-12 01:10:53	En_Passant	fuck profanity

2016-01-12 01:10:59	@PikFan	/irony
2016-01-12 01:11:17	@PikFan	actually, bad timing
2016-01-12 01:11:22	@PikFan	I've gotta go
2016-01-12 01:11:26	En_Passant	Aw
2016-01-12 01:11:34	@PikFan	I'll let you two discuss Louie
2016-01-12 01:11:37	ScruffyChat	Aww shoot
2016-01-12 01:11:39	@PikFan	and other story stuff
2016-01-12 01:11:42	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-12 01:11:43	@PikFan	yeah, sorry guys :/
2016-01-12 01:11:55	En_Passant	What about Louie?
2016-01-12 01:12:06	@PikFan	Scruffy's fic about Louie
2016-01-12 01:12:22	ScruffyChat	Have you read it so far?
2016-01-12 01:12:31	@PikFan	but yeah, gotta go now, sorry guys
2016-01-12 01:12:36	ScruffyChat	See ya
2016-01-12 01:12:43	@PikFan	might be back on in a couple hours, if you're on then

2016-01-12 01:12:56	En_Passant	Oh, I thought we were discussing PikFan's fic
2016-01-12 01:13:18	ScruffyChat	He was actually just talking about someone else's, about Splatoon
2016-01-12 01:13:28	ScruffyChat	But he told me he got even newer fanfic ideas
2016-01-12 01:14:02	ScruffyChat	One about Olimar not fixing the Dolphin and one about the Koppaites either not making it off PNF-404 or not bringing enough fruit back to Koppai
2016-01-12 01:14:40	ScruffyChat	Both interesting ideas that could lead somewhere, particularly the second one
2016-01-12 01:14:45	En_Passant	So, the bad endings
2016-01-12 01:15:13	En_Passant	In the former two, we can reasonably assume that they die

2016-01-12 01:58:30	En_Passant	It's a cloud storage used by Microsoft
2016-01-12 02:00:01	ScruffyChat	Ah, I see
2016-01-12 02:03:40	ScruffyChat	I wanted to tell you
2016-01-12 02:04:01	ScruffyChat	It turns out I'm not going to be making a video series about music theory and such
2016-01-12 02:04:22	ScruffyChat	As first I don't yet have the resources and second music theory isn't really best suited in video format
2016-01-12 02:04:38	ScruffyChat	It'd be easier for me to make a document to teach you, or to demonstrate it live somehow

2016-01-12 03:03:36	ScruffyChat	Something like that
2016-01-12 03:03:50	ScruffyChat	It's much better for you to write it down, I'm just not sure how to go about showing you
2016-01-12 03:09:16	En_Passant	Write it down?
2016-01-12 03:10:25	ScruffyChat	I mean to take notes
2016-01-12 03:10:56	ScruffyChat	I would like to do a video, but there are many existing ones and I fear it would take too long with the limited resources I have
2016-01-12 03:19:57	En_Passant	I'm uploading my files to OneDrive
2016-01-12 03:19:57	En_Passant	It is at 255.7 MB of 3.3 GB
2016-01-12 03:20:30	En_Passant	... it's going to take a while
2016-01-12 03:20:39	ScruffyChat	What is it?
2016-01-12 03:35:09	En_Passant	What do you mean?
2016-01-12 03:35:22	ScruffyChat	what sort of files?
2016-01-12 03:35:37	ScruffyChat	It's something big to take up 3.3 GB
2016-01-12 03:58:25	En_Passant	Everything in my documents folder
2016-01-12 03:59:01	En_Passant	So, all of my schoolwork, fun stuff, and I think I have a couple of games saved there as well
2016-01-12 03:59:20	En_Passant	(Don't know if those will be uploaded)
2016-01-12 04:03:30	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-12 04:03:33	ScruffyChat	Woah
2016-01-12 04:03:38	ScruffyChat	I hope it all goes smoothly
2016-01-12 04:04:09	ScruffyChat	I just learned how to change fun parameters in Pikmin 2
2016-01-12 04:04:31	ScruffyChat	Like the value of the debt, the gravity, and how far the camera zooms
2016-01-12 04:04:53	En_Passant	I didn't know you could edit those
2016-01-12 04:05:32	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I've extracted the in game files, and those parameters are just numbers on a little text file
2016-01-12 04:05:55	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately most of the game is in Japanese and I can't get my text-editing application to correctly encode it
2016-01-12 04:06:05	ScruffyChat	So it makes even less sense than it should
2016-01-12 04:06:41	En_Passant	But it already doesn't make sense
2016-01-12 04:06:49	En_Passant	So it makes less than no sense?
2016-01-12 04:07:08	ScruffyChat	Exactly
2016-01-12 04:07:18	ScruffyChat	It makes negative sense
2016-01-12 04:07:33	ScruffyChat	I can understand the opposite of it
2016-01-12 04:09:17	ScruffyChat	I meant to ask when you came on, have you finished Pikmin 3 (and hopefully enjoyed it)?
2016-01-12 04:09:33	En_Passant	Wow, I haven't spoken to you in that long?
2016-01-12 04:09:39	En_Passant	FeelsBadMan
2016-01-12 04:10:03	ScruffyChat	It's alright, it's my doing really
2016-01-12 04:10:11	ScruffyChat	I actually had less time during winter break
2016-01-12 04:10:23	ScruffyChat	My schedule is nice and open now that the semester has begun
2016-01-12 04:10:26	En_Passant	I wasn't on here much during Winter Break, or since
2016-01-12 04:10:56	En_Passant	But yeah, I spent the rest of Christmas doing All Fruits
2016-01-12 04:11:02	En_Passant	Beat it not long before midnight
2016-01-12 04:11:11	ScruffyChat	Nice!
2016-01-12 04:11:24	En_Passant	I've done some of Mission Mode
2016-01-12 04:11:38	En_Passant	It's actually really hard
2016-01-12 04:11:47	ScruffyChat	I know!
2016-01-12 04:12:00	ScruffyChat	I have no idea how those world records are acheived
2016-01-12 04:12:22	En_Passant	Meticulous planning and many, many resets
2016-01-12 04:12:26	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-12 04:12:40	En_Passant	I spent hours just trying to finish Silver Lake Remix
2016-01-12 04:12:45	ScruffyChat	Same
2016-01-12 04:13:25	ScruffyChat	That is my least favorite, but it's still great
2016-01-12 04:14:01	ScruffyChat	I've put a lot of hours into just trying to bump up my Tropical Forest score
2016-01-12 04:18:41	En_Passant	only 4,952 files remaining
2016-01-12 04:18:48	En_Passant	This looks like an overnight project
2016-01-12 04:19:55	ScruffyChat	More power to you
2016-01-12 04:20:15	ScruffyChat	But I'm glad you were able to see the good ending to Pikmin 3
2016-01-12 04:20:32	ScruffyChat	PikFan was telling you about a fanfiction I'm writing about Louie
2016-01-12 04:20:56	ScruffyChat	And that's where it starts: at the end of Pikmin 3's events
2016-01-12 04:21:07	En_Passant	Yeah, I saw the secret log
2016-01-12 04:21:42	En_Passant	... and Pikmin V's plot revolves around going to find him, you know
2016-01-12 04:22:19	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-12 04:22:38	ScruffyChat	Somewhere I want to mention both your game and PikFan's stories
2016-01-12 04:22:57	ScruffyChat	The secret log?
2016-01-12 04:23:25	En_Passant	The journal entry or whatchamacallit
2016-01-12 04:23:47	En_Passant	Whatever appears on a completed all fruits file that says that Louie is missing
2016-01-12 04:23:57	ScruffyChat	Ah yes
2016-01-12 04:24:02	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that's where I started
2016-01-12 04:24:36	ScruffyChat	Here it is if you haven't read it before and would like to
2016-01-12 04:24:37	ScruffyChat	http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/thread/117/louie
2016-01-12 04:24:54	ScruffyChat	Only Chapter 1 and the two records are done, I'm working on Chapter 2
2016-01-12 04:32:46	En_Passant	Two records?
2016-01-12 04:32:49	En_Passant	I only see one
2016-01-12 04:35:01	ScruffyChat	Record 0 is the introduction
2016-01-12 04:36:47	En_Passant	Oh
2016-01-12 04:36:52	En_Passant	Right
2016-01-12 04:44:01	ScruffyChat	What do you think?
2016-01-12 05:21:49	En_Passant	I don't want to say "interesting" because that's a pretty overused term for "meh"
2016-01-12 05:21:56	En_Passant	Intriguing isn't much better
2016-01-12 05:22:41	En_Passant	It was well-written, but I can't really comment on the plot so far because there isn't much.
2016-01-12 05:23:00	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I have to write more first
2016-01-12 05:23:02	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-01-12 05:23:43	ScruffyChat	I have a lot to cover though, from Louie's father to his childhood to his first mission and so on
2016-01-12 05:24:55	ScruffyChat	I have to go for today
2016-01-12 05:25:12	ScruffyChat	It's been nice talking with you again, we need to arrange some meeting time with Espyo

2016-01-12 19:53:03	ScruffyChat	A question
2016-01-12 19:53:32	ScruffyChat	If, in a playthrough of Pikmin, I ever sprouted 511 Pikmin
2016-01-12 19:53:43	ScruffyChat	And 216 died by the time the ship was completed
2016-01-12 19:53:52	ScruffyChat	How is it that 112 survived?
2016-01-12 19:54:13	ScruffyChat	I mean I know I plucked forty Pikmin from Candypop Buds
2016-01-12 19:54:49	@Espyo	hmm

2016-01-12 20:03:49	Yoshi2	on regular duckduckgo, my repo is not first
2016-01-12 20:09:25	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-12 20:09:30	@Espyo	"regular"?
2016-01-12 20:10:37	Yoshi2	well, without using !google or whatever fancy functions it has
2016-01-12 20:19:28	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-12 20:21:24	Yoshi2	but yay, I am first for some sort of configuration of google search results
2016-01-12 20:21:54	Yoshi2	now I just need to wait for nintendo's C&D to come in
2016-01-12 20:22:20	@Espyo	mhm
2016-01-12 20:22:35	@J	!bang is great, I use it so much
2016-01-12 20:22:44	@J	even for sites I don't know exist
2016-01-12 20:22:51	@J	you can do stuff like !whois or !thesaurus
2016-01-12 20:23:00	@Espyo	neat
2016-01-12 20:24:10	@J	even if you use another site for search, I would still put DDG as default, then do !g every time or whatever
2016-01-12 20:24:50	@J	(or in my case using uzbl I can have really simple one-letter shortcuts for stuff, so I don't need to !g)
2016-01-12 20:28:50	Yoshi2	with !g in duckduckgo, my repo is 4th place or so
2016-01-12 20:29:22	Yoshi2	it must be a very obscure topic if my repo can rise to the top like that
2016-01-12 20:29:58	@J	wait, but that just redirects to Google
2016-01-12 20:30:02	@J	so it should be no different
2016-01-12 20:30:15	@J	unless Google actually alters the results based on HTTP_REFERER?
2016-01-12 20:30:38	Yoshi2	yeah, no idea
2016-01-12 20:31:14	Yoshi2	finding truly unbiased google results is a bit difficult
2016-01-12 20:32:49	@J	I'm surprised Google doesn't let you check as part of Analytics or something
2016-01-12 20:35:49	Yoshi2	I think github shows referers, I could see whether I am as popular as google suggests
2016-01-12 20:36:49	Yoshi2	3 views and 2 unique visits, I'm truly popular
2016-01-12 20:37:13	Yoshi2	.... yeah, almost nobody is searching for this

2016-01-12 20:38:05	@J	at one point I was planning to add archive browsing/editing to GCEdit
2016-01-12 20:38:14	@J	so if I ever go back to that, I'll totally use your code
2016-01-12 20:40:12	Yoshi2	there are more efficient C implementations of yaz0
2016-01-12 20:42:06	@J	a compressor too?
2016-01-12 20:42:19	@J	and that's if I can be bothered, GCEdit is Python
2016-01-12 20:42:58	@J	it only needs to be as fast as I/O anyway

2016-01-12 20:44:34	Yoshi2	I thought about maybe doing python bindings for an existing C implementation of the decompressor/compressor, but compiling code on windows is a bitch
2016-01-12 20:45:01	@J	yeah, I have done that before

2016-01-13 22:47:07	En_Passant	facebook has gone too far
2016-01-13 22:47:32	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant
2016-01-13 22:47:33	ScruffyChat	How so?
2016-01-13 22:47:38	En_Passant	espyo's on my "people you may know" list
2016-01-13 22:47:50	En_Passant	i have not talked to him on facebook at all
2016-01-13 22:47:50	@Espyo	...
2016-01-13 22:47:54	@Espyo	same here
2016-01-13 22:48:00	@Espyo	wonder if it snooped our e-mails
2016-01-13 22:48:38	ScruffyChat	hm, mine hasn't done that
2016-01-13 22:48:49	ScruffyChat	Maybe I don't have the same email for Facebook
2016-01-13 22:48:57	ScruffyChat	Oh, yeah, I don't
2016-01-13 22:50:24	@Espyo	I hope the NSA enjoys my taste of porn and my constant google searches for how to handle sliding along walls in game development
2016-01-13 22:50:41	@Espyo	'cause if they think they're finding terrorist information on my e-mails, they're wasting their time
2016-01-13 22:52:02	En_Passant	um
2016-01-13 22:52:04	En_Passant	tmi?
2016-01-13 22:52:12	UltraMario	you rang?
2016-01-13 22:52:13	UltraMario	;)
2016-01-13 22:54:42	@Espyo	not enough information for a tmi, I'd say
2016-01-13 22:54:46	@Espyo	but enough of that, time to get back to this
2016-01-13 22:54:52	@Espyo	I HAVE to fix wall collisions tonight
2016-01-13 22:54:56	@Espyo	I'm tired of wrestling this
2016-01-13 23:01:38	Testyo	probably not enough like medicine
2016-01-13 23:02:24	@Espyo	Testyo, don't say medicine in an NSA conversation
2016-01-13 23:02:25	Testyo	yeah, I think I'll like this story
2016-01-13 23:02:29	@Espyo	they'll connect the dots and think you're selling drugs
2016-01-13 23:02:40	@Espyo	oh, they'll like to snoop through our chatroom all right
2016-01-13 23:02:48	@Espyo	specially your nonsense, Testyo
2016-01-13 23:02:49	Testyo	maybe you could tell him you did you try two header rows?
2016-01-13 23:02:57	@Espyo	no need, they can read this
2016-01-13 23:14:18	@J	[22:54:52] @Espyo I HAVE to fix wall collisions tonight

2016-01-13 23:14:18	@J	[23:01:38] Testyo probably not enough like medicine
2016-01-13 23:14:20	Testyo	when the image with the season switcher + its upgrades came out, I don't know
2016-01-13 23:14:21	@J	this is amazing
2016-01-13 23:14:36	@Espyo	yep
2016-01-13 23:15:12	@J	I would assume the 'people you may know' thing is based on friends of friends
2016-01-13 23:15:24	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that at first too
2016-01-13 23:15:30	@Espyo	but we don't really have any friends of friends
2016-01-13 23:15:47	@J	you don't communicate with Pikmin/Pikipedia people?
2016-01-13 23:15:50	@Espyo	on facebook, I only have some guys that came from Pikmin wikia
2016-01-13 23:16:02	@Espyo	other than that, nobody from Pikipedia
2016-01-13 23:16:29	@Espyo	so unless En_Passant is also friends with somebody from the skype group...
2016-01-13 23:16:38	En_Passant	which I'm not
2016-01-13 23:16:46	@J	...friends of friends of friends?
2016-01-13 23:17:00	@Espyo	 6 friend rule, eh?
2016-01-13 23:17:04	En_Passant	i doubt any of my friends have even heard of it
2016-01-13 23:17:09	@Espyo	 6 degrees of separation, that's the name
2016-01-13 23:17:10	Testyo	6 degrees = 0.10472 rad
2016-01-13 23:17:26	@Espyo	let me check my facebook
2016-01-13 23:17:27	@J	I was wondering what this new law you'd come up with was
2016-01-13 23:17:43	@Espyo	to see if I'm getting any suggestion like that
2016-01-13 23:17:49	@Espyo	hey, my laws are always tried and true
2016-01-13 23:17:59	@J	well, there's probably some reasonable explanation
2016-01-13 23:18:15	@J	and it's probably unreasonable
2016-01-13 23:18:23	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-13 23:18:29	En_Passant	Yeah, it snooped our e-mail conversation
2016-01-13 23:18:59	@Espyo	...there it is
2016-01-13 23:19:15	@Espyo	you're 7th on my list of people I might know
2016-01-13 23:19:29	@J	BTW, 0.1 radians of separation
2016-01-13 23:19:30	Testyo	0.1 radians = 5.72958 deg
2016-01-13 23:19:34	@Espyo	right next to a guy I talk with a lot on a friend group, but haven't added as a friend, and a person I know nothing of
2016-01-13 23:19:36	@J	so catchy
2016-01-13 23:21:35	En_Passant	You're not high on my list at all
2016-01-13 23:22:17	ScruffyChat	It seems like it should be fewer than 6 degrees of separation
2016-01-13 23:22:18	Testyo	6 degrees = 0.10472 rad
2016-01-13 23:22:40	@Espyo	facebook does tell you if you have friends in common
2016-01-13 23:22:42	@Espyo	but only to one degree
2016-01-13 23:22:48	ScruffyChat	Similar to the idea where you can color any map in a maximum of four different colors
2016-01-13 23:23:08	@Espyo	heh, I remember learning of that in school
2016-01-13 23:23:10	@Espyo	kinda mindblowing
2016-01-13 23:23:15	ScruffyChat	yeah
2016-01-13 23:24:09	En_Passant	I never learned that
2016-01-13 23:25:49	ScruffyChat	Yeah, with 2D cluster of shapes you can imagine, if you try to color in the map of shapes such that no two contiguous shapes are the same color, you need no more than 4 colors
2016-01-13 23:25:59	ScruffyChat	*any 2D cluster
2016-01-13 23:26:07	@J	it depends on the definition of 'shape'
2016-01-13 23:26:44	@Espyo	I think I disproved that when I was a kid
2016-01-13 23:26:56	@J	disproved what?
2016-01-13 23:27:08	@Espyo	that map thingie
2016-01-13 23:27:09	En_Passant	Hm, yeah, that doesn't seem like it would work
2016-01-13 23:27:26	En_Passant	What color would a border around the Windows logo be?
2016-01-13 23:27:50	ScruffyChat	The border could be red, and each of the squares could be orange or yellow since they don't touch
2016-01-13 23:27:54	@Espyo	guess that doesn't really count as a shape cluster
2016-01-13 23:27:59	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-01-13 23:28:02	@Espyo	hurr
2016-01-13 23:28:14	ScruffyChat	If they did touch, the two shapes touching at a corner are not considered contiguous

2016-01-14 00:07:16	@PikFan	hi
2016-01-14 00:07:19	ScruffyChat	Hi PikFan
2016-01-14 00:08:05	@PikFan	so in that fic I was reading the other day, the two main characters get arrested
2016-01-14 00:08:12	@PikFan	and I was thinking
2016-01-14 00:08:28	@PikFan	what if something like that happened in PMW?
2016-01-14 00:08:40	ScruffyChat	Arrest? Are there Pikmin police?
2016-01-14 00:08:50	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-01-14 00:09:10	@PikFan	I mean, what good is a country without law and law enforcement
2016-01-14 00:09:38	@PikFan	but anyway, I took the idea further
2016-01-14 00:09:52	@PikFan	what if there was a coup?
2016-01-14 00:09:56	ScruffyChat	Woah
2016-01-14 00:10:07	@PikFan	for the entire Pikmin Republic
2016-01-14 00:10:41	@PikFan	I got really excited thinking about it, and I had to write it down
2016-01-14 00:10:43	ScruffyChat	That would be insanely cool
2016-01-14 00:10:47	ScruffyChat	Yeah yeah
2016-01-14 00:10:54	ScruffyChat	Who would carry it out?
2016-01-14 00:11:30	@PikFan	I'm not sure, probably some "minor" government official
2016-01-14 00:13:00	@PikFan	let's see...
2016-01-14 00:13:49	@PikFan	chapter 8 is the ambush, 9 and 10 (maybe 11?) is the journey to the capital...
2016-01-14 00:14:08	@PikFan	a few chapters after that are more story events
2016-01-14 00:14:38	@PikFan	possibly chapter 14 or 15 is when the coup would be initiated
2016-01-14 00:14:49	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-01-14 00:14:50	@PikFan	and the resulting siege
2016-01-14 00:15:59	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 00:16:13	@PikFan	now, I'm not sure if I want to have one of the main characters captured or not, because it'd mean they'd have to go in and rescue them, easily another chapter before they finally escape
2016-01-14 00:16:32	@PikFan	(they = main characters)
2016-01-14 00:16:38	ScruffyChat	Hmm
2016-01-14 00:16:50	ScruffyChat	Well on what grounds would they be captured anyway?
2016-01-14 00:17:05	En_Passant	I have some questions
2016-01-14 00:17:16	@PikFan	hi En_Passant
2016-01-14 00:17:19	En_Passant	hi
2016-01-14 00:17:26	En_Passant	that's not one of my questions
2016-01-14 00:17:46	En_Passant	... anyway
2016-01-14 00:17:53	@PikFan	(right, I'm just greeting you)
2016-01-14 00:18:22	En_Passant	(i tried making a joke. twas bad)
2016-01-14 00:18:32	@PikFan	(I see)
2016-01-14 00:19:15	En_Passant	The first thing that comes to mind witht hem being captured is that they're assumed to be part of the government/revolt depending on who's doing the capturing
2016-01-14 00:19:26	En_Passant	But why's there a revolution to begin with?
2016-01-14 00:19:36	En_Passant	Aren't the Pikmin subservient to the Onions anyway?
2016-01-14 00:19:47	@PikFan	oh, good point
2016-01-14 00:20:34	@PikFan	well, I'm thinking that there's a traitor in the government with ties to the enemy forces, and the enemy forces seek to conquer the Pikmin
2016-01-14 00:21:11	@PikFan	...of course, this is completely cliché, but alas, my ideas are lacking
2016-01-14 00:21:22	En_Passant	Yeah, I'd work on it more
2016-01-14 00:22:12	@PikFan	I still want to incorporate betrayal somehow
2016-01-14 00:22:43	En_Passant	Would the traitor be the initiator, or the traitor being discovered cause a dissatisfied group to initiate?
2016-01-14 00:23:22	@PikFan	the former is what I was thinking, but I also like the latter
2016-01-14 00:23:42	En_Passant	The latter needs even more depth
2016-01-14 00:24:20	@PikFan	say the group initiates the coup, but they're fed up with the government for some reason
2016-01-14 00:25:00	@PikFan	then, realizing that what they did gave the Republic to the enemy, they turn around and fight FOR the Republic
2016-01-14 00:25:29	En_Passant	Would the coup be successful?
2016-01-14 00:25:41	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 00:25:56	En_Passant	Then they would probably fight the Republic's enemies anyway
2016-01-14 00:26:08	@PikFan	right
2016-01-14 00:26:35	En_Passant	After, you perform a coup because you want to do things your way, but that still involves doing the things
2016-01-14 00:27:04	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 00:27:26	@PikFan	like I said, they unknowingly played right into the enemy's hands
2016-01-14 00:27:37	@PikFan	oh, you mentioned the Onions
2016-01-14 00:28:13	@PikFan	that could be a reason why they revolt: why spend their lives slaving away for the Onions?
2016-01-14 00:28:25	@PikFan	they want freedom
2016-01-14 00:29:38	En_Passant	Perhaps, but wouldn't they be more aware that they die without the Onion's protection?
2016-01-14 00:30:14	@PikFan	I suppose so
2016-01-14 00:30:39	@PikFan	but they don't want to be protected by the Onions anymore
2016-01-14 00:30:51	@PikFan	they want to protect themselves
2016-01-14 00:31:06	@PikFan	if that makes any sense...?
2016-01-14 00:31:24	ScruffyChat	Perhaps they claim to have invented a technology that is more convenient and efficient at the Onions' job
2016-01-14 00:31:33	ScruffyChat	And they want to use that instead of Onions
2016-01-14 00:31:39	@PikFan	possibly, yes
2016-01-14 00:32:02	@PikFan	see, in my story, it's revealed that Pikmin are older than Onions
2016-01-14 00:32:18	@PikFan	that is, the Pikmin MADE the Onions
2016-01-14 00:32:28	@PikFan	to protect themselves
2016-01-14 00:32:41	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-01-14 00:34:05	En_Passant	And the Onions gained sovereignty somehow?
2016-01-14 00:34:28	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 00:35:20	@PikFan	the Onions' creators never intended for their descendants to be "ruled" by the Onions
2016-01-14 00:35:25	En_Passant	And they made them before they learned that they couldn't swim?
2016-01-14 00:35:38	En_Passant	(except Blues, but you know what I mean)
2016-01-14 00:35:38	@PikFan	...?
2016-01-14 00:36:00	En_Passant	The Onions existed when Olimar came through. Back then, Pikmin were dumber than bricks
2016-01-14 00:36:08	En_Passant	How would they have engineered a flying ship
2016-01-14 00:36:24	@PikFan	think of lost civilizations
2016-01-14 00:36:25	En_Passant	With AI that outsmarted them
2016-01-14 00:36:39	En_Passant	Yes, the humans
2016-01-14 00:36:59	@PikFan	no, I mean actual lost civilizations
2016-01-14 00:37:17	En_Passant	???
2016-01-14 00:37:24	@PikFan	some of them were ages ahead of their time
2016-01-14 00:37:27	ScruffyChat	Like, Mesopotamians? Mayans?
2016-01-14 00:37:34	@PikFan	yes, yes
2016-01-14 00:37:38	ScruffyChat	But not space travel ehead
2016-01-14 00:37:46	En_Passant	Generally, technology doesn't retrogress
2016-01-14 00:37:47	@PikFan	well, right
2016-01-14 00:37:49	ScruffyChat	Unless you watch Ancient Aliens
2016-01-14 00:38:02	ScruffyChat	In which case I urge you to stop wasting your time
2016-01-14 00:38:26	En_Passant	Fiction loves doing it, but real life doesn't really work that way
2016-01-14 00:39:34	@PikFan	...anyway, my point: the Pikmin were advanced before their "demise", and we see them as unintelligent in the canon games
2016-01-14 00:39:50	ScruffyChat	So they devolved?
2016-01-14 00:39:59	@PikFan	afterwards, their old history and information returns to them
2016-01-14 00:40:08	@PikFan	don't ask how, it just does
2016-01-14 00:41:13	@PikFan	it's because the Pikmin were sealed away for so long that yeah, I guess they did devolve
2016-01-14 00:41:22	@PikFan	intellectually, anyway
2016-01-14 00:42:34	<--	En_Passant (Mibbit@46-01-6-11.hlrn.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-01-14 00:43:15	@PikFan	16:35	En_Passant	Fiction loves doing it, but real life doesn't really work that way
2016-01-14 00:43:28	@PikFan	well... this IS fiction
2016-01-14 00:43:54	@PikFan	I just feel like he has this idea that all fiction must be realistic
2016-01-14 00:44:37	@PikFan	if all fiction was realistic, I doubt it'd be as interesting
2016-01-14 00:44:48	ScruffyChat	I suppose
2016-01-14 00:44:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 00:45:03	ScruffyChat	Not necessarily realism, but authenticity
2016-01-14 00:45:24	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 00:45:46	ScruffyChat	Reactions, logic, sequence of events should mimic the real world authentically
2016-01-14 00:46:27	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 00:46:36	ScruffyChat	But there certainly is elbow room in fiction
2016-01-14 00:47:18	@PikFan	so anyway, some group of Pikmin have decided they don't want to rely off the Onions anymore, and start a revolution
2016-01-14 00:47:35	@PikFan	but this revolution is an opportunity for the enemy to invade
2016-01-14 00:47:46	@PikFan	which is exactly what they wanted
2016-01-14 00:48:03	@PikFan	but this idea of Onion vs Pikmin doesn't go away
2016-01-14 00:48:30	ScruffyChat	I see
2016-01-14 00:48:42	@PikFan	I think it'll actually play a major role in the alternate PNF-404
2016-01-14 00:49:43	ScruffyChat	Ooh
2016-01-14 00:52:36	ScruffyChat	So, just to clarify, they enter alternate PNF-404 to escape the chaos at the Republic?
2016-01-14 00:52:53	@PikFan	yes
2016-01-14 00:53:13	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-14 00:53:28	ScruffyChat	Is there an anti-war going on in the anti-Republic?
2016-01-14 00:55:00	@PikFan	anti-war?
2016-01-14 00:55:28	@PikFan	oh, the parallel world
2016-01-14 00:55:42	@PikFan	no, I think things are quite stable
2016-01-14 00:56:03	@PikFan	it's a nice contrast
2016-01-14 00:56:56	ScruffyChat	Ah, yeah
2016-01-14 01:00:01	@PikFan	so, how original does the whole story sound? like, how would you rate its originality and creativity?

2016-01-14 01:08:27	Neocraftz1553	cool
2016-01-14 01:09:06	Neocraftz1553	there's one setback to using some custom textured in my map
2016-01-14 01:09:12	Neocraftz1553	people have to download th
2016-01-14 01:09:14	Neocraftz1553	them
2016-01-14 01:09:59	Neocraftz1553	But, I'll zip the areas and a textures folder
2016-01-14 01:10:06	Neocraftz1553	Itll make things easier
2016-01-14 01:11:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah

2016-01-14 01:12:36	Neocraftz1553	never seen fish eye lens in blender
2016-01-14 01:12:40	@PikFan	what'd I miss?
2016-01-14 01:12:47	Neocraftz1553	nothing much
2016-01-14 01:12:55	@PikFan	oh okay
2016-01-14 01:14:37	ScruffyChat	Neocraftz1553 just said he'll include his custom textures in a zip folder when he shares his area
2016-01-14 01:14:51	Neocraftz1553	areas
2016-01-14 01:14:53	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-14 01:14:55	ScruffyChat	And I said I've learned how to get a fisheye lens in Blender
2016-01-14 01:15:28	Neocraftz1553	the only areas that'll give me problems are The Forest Navel and The Final Trail
2016-01-14 01:15:58	ScruffyChat	How come?
2016-01-14 01:16:28	Neocraftz1553	The Final Trail has water, but the engine doesn't have hazards yet so any pikmin can walk across the water texture as if it was solid ground
2016-01-14 01:16:48	@PikFan	the Final _Trail_
2016-01-14 01:16:51	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-14 01:17:04	@PikFan	in a way, it is a trail
2016-01-14 01:17:43	Neocraftz1553	And The Forest Navel has water and has this one cave place where the puffstool is, and that place has some edges that are hard to replicate

2016-01-14 01:19:45	@PikFan	well, what does the Purple Pikmin do?
2016-01-14 01:20:01	Neocraftz1553	squish enemies

2016-01-14 01:22:51	@PikFan	what about a Rock or Winged Pikmin? we need at least one from P3
2016-01-14 01:23:06	Neocraftz1553	I nominate Rock
2016-01-14 01:23:30	Neocraftz1553	Theres also a beach area which I might render next
2016-01-14 01:23:44	Neocraftz1553	Its on the same .blend file
2016-01-14 01:23:56	ScruffyChat	I like the Rock Pikmin idea
2016-01-14 01:24:01	Neocraftz1553	I might do pikmin carrying some pellets
2016-01-14 01:24:03	ScruffyChat	It wouldn't need drumsticks
2016-01-14 01:24:08	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-14 01:24:27	ScruffyChat	But it could also be a leader, if you want to consider that

2016-01-14 01:26:59	ScruffyChat	Yes?
2016-01-14 01:27:00	@PikFan	I was going to say, you need to include Yellow Pikmim
2016-01-14 01:27:06	@PikFan	*Pikmin
2016-01-14 01:27:12	ScruffyChat	I need to?
2016-01-14 01:27:18	ScruffyChat	I certainly can
2016-01-14 01:27:23	ScruffyChat	I've got a saxophone model ready
2016-01-14 01:27:35	@PikFan	well yeah, we should have all three main types
2016-01-14 01:27:38	@PikFan	BUT
2016-01-14 01:27:47	@PikFan	you said wires and amps
2016-01-14 01:27:53	Neocraftz1553	pikmin are so hard to manipulate
2016-01-14 01:28:03	@PikFan	so this made me think: electrodes!
2016-01-14 01:28:10	ScruffyChat	Woah
2016-01-14 01:28:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah, I suppose...
2016-01-14 01:28:30	ScruffyChat	So far, I haven't used any canonical material except for the Pikmin themselves and brand names
2016-01-14 01:28:33	@PikFan	I mean, you don't have to
2016-01-14 01:28:41	@PikFan	just an idea
2016-01-14 01:28:50	ScruffyChat	But I could include an electrode somewhere, I think
2016-01-14 01:28:56	@PikFan	the saxophone idea still seems interesting
2016-01-14 01:29:00	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-01-14 01:29:17	ScruffyChat	Maybe the electrode could somehow be part of the saxophone
2016-01-14 01:29:20	ScruffyChat	Or connected to it
2016-01-14 01:29:29	@PikFan	ooh

2016-01-14 01:59:17	Neocraftz1553	I started with the beady long legs model
2016-01-14 01:59:29	Neocraftz1553	then I altered its form a little bit
2016-01-14 01:59:36	Neocraftz1553	then I added in the spikes
2016-01-14 02:00:00	Neocraftz1553	oh, and if you look at one of its leg segments, it doesnt have any spikes...
2016-01-14 02:00:09	Neocraftz1553	...and...
2016-01-14 02:00:28	Neocraftz1553	then I lifted its leg up as if it was stomping...
2016-01-14 02:01:00	Neocraftz1553	then I put it back down, but it is not on the same level as the others, just noticed that...
2016-01-14 02:01:07	Neocraftz1553	it still needs some work

2016-01-14 02:21:07	Neocraftz1553	sorry, I do not know the names of most of the tools
2016-01-14 02:21:28	Neocraftz1553	but anyways, I had pikmin there and they looked burried
2016-01-14 02:21:51	Neocraftz1553	ok, the new render looks done, check on my user page, Im uploading it
2016-01-14 02:24:16	Neocraftz1553	the little mistake is the pikmin burried

2016-01-14 02:36:55	ScruffyChat	Yes, the story was great
2016-01-14 02:37:00	ScruffyChat	S ofar
2016-01-14 02:37:11	ScruffyChat	It gets you hooked
2016-01-14 02:37:20	ScruffyChat	And Neo, nice render!
2016-01-14 02:37:23	ScruffyChat	I just saw it
2016-01-14 02:37:26	ScruffyChat	Oh, he left
2016-01-14 02:37:40	ScruffyChat	Well anyway
2016-01-14 02:37:47	ScruffyChat	I can't wait to see how Ruby gets out of that
2016-01-14 02:37:53	ScruffyChat	How all those questions get answered
2016-01-14 02:37:59	ScruffyChat	What type of Pikmin is Stella?
2016-01-14 02:39:53	@PikFan	hi, sorry, was playing Splatoon again
2016-01-14 02:40:13	@PikFan	well, "Stella" is just a placeholder name; will probably change it
2016-01-14 02:40:32	@PikFan	that entire thing will change dramatically as per our discussion today
2016-01-14 02:40:49	@PikFan	to answer your question, I'm thinking that "Stella" is a Blue Pikmin
2016-01-14 02:41:10	@PikFan	also: water vs fire
2016-01-14 02:44:26	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 02:44:31	ScruffyChat	Cool!
2016-01-14 02:46:58	ScruffyChat	I have to confess, I couldn't wait
2016-01-14 02:47:07	ScruffyChat	I'm writing the Titan Dweevil chapter now
2016-01-14 02:47:19	ScruffyChat	So that I have an endpoint to write to

2016-01-14 02:52:12	@PikFan	*yay!
2016-01-14 02:53:06	ScruffyChat	I couldn't wait to just write my way to that point
2016-01-14 02:53:16	ScruffyChat	I was too excited to write about the Titan Dweevil
2016-01-14 02:53:29	ScruffyChat	And what happens in the Dream Den

2016-01-14 03:10:30	@PikFan	so in the story snippet I was going to have Ruby jump out of the window
2016-01-14 03:10:49	@PikFan	and then use fire to land herself
2016-01-14 03:11:45	ScruffyChat	Woah
2016-01-14 03:11:48	ScruffyChat	Why not?
2016-01-14 03:14:23	@PikFan	well, I COULD adapt it to my current ideas
2016-01-14 03:14:40	@PikFan	just have to figure out who the coup-initiator is

2016-01-14 03:22:25	Neocraftz1553	I am going to be improving it over the next few days. maybe.
2016-01-14 03:23:39	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, it's great!
2016-01-14 03:23:42	ScruffyChat	Well done

2016-01-14 03:34:16	Neocraftz1553	I cant seem to get it right
2016-01-14 03:34:32	Neocraftz1553	everytime I use it, it looks like a sandstorm
2016-01-14 03:36:26	Neocraftz1553	scruffychat
2016-01-14 03:37:08	ScruffyChat	Hi sorry
2016-01-14 03:37:20	Neocraftz1553	its ok
2016-01-14 03:37:21	ScruffyChat	You have to increase the sample count
2016-01-14 03:37:32	ScruffyChat	in render settings (the camera icon)
2016-01-14 03:37:37	Neocraftz1553	yeah, dialed it up to 400
2016-01-14 03:37:44	Neocraftz1553	still looked baf
2016-01-14 03:37:46	Neocraftz1553	bad
2016-01-14 03:37:46	ScruffyChat	which one?
2016-01-14 03:37:56	Neocraftz1553	render
2016-01-14 03:38:01	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-14 03:38:02	Neocraftz1553	the one on top of preview
2016-01-14 03:38:04	ScruffyChat	that's it
2016-01-14 03:38:20	ScruffyChat	That one only applies if you render the image
2016-01-14 03:38:30	Neocraftz1553	on the preview?
2016-01-14 03:38:31	ScruffyChat	If you're just viewing it in the 3D view, use preview
2016-01-14 03:38:37	Neocraftz1553	ik
2016-01-14 03:38:41	Neocraftz1553	I rendered it
2016-01-14 03:38:44	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-01-14 03:38:51	ScruffyChat	The thing is, 400 may take a while
2016-01-14 03:38:51	Neocraftz1553	still looked like a sandstorn
2016-01-14 03:38:59	Neocraftz1553	oooh
2016-01-14 03:39:02	ScruffyChat	50 or 100 ought to be fine
2016-01-14 03:39:11	Neocraftz1553	it clears up after a while+
2016-01-14 03:39:14	Neocraftz1553	*?
2016-01-14 03:39:14	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 03:39:20	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-14 03:39:29	Neocraftz1553	ok
2016-01-14 03:39:33	ScruffyChat	That's because it's taking more and more samples of lighting until it gets to 400 for each pixel
2016-01-14 03:39:45	ScruffyChat	It just takes time
2016-01-14 03:39:51	Neocraftz1553	heh yeah
2016-01-14 03:40:44	Neocraftz1553	so, what is that secret project your working on?
2016-01-14 03:41:12	ScruffyChat	It's sort of gone on the backburner for now
2016-01-14 03:41:24	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-14 03:41:33	ScruffyChat	I was going to animate, score, and produce a prologue to Pikmin Forever
2016-01-14 03:41:38	Neocraftz1553	what was it about?
2016-01-14 03:41:44	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-14 03:41:53	Neocraftz1553	sounds awsome
2016-01-14 03:42:05	ScruffyChat	And I got pretty far, but I wasn't happy with it and more and more people started requesting
2016-01-14 03:42:12	ScruffyChat	Plus school
2016-01-14 03:42:25	Neocraftz1553	heh, yeah, school
2016-01-14 03:42:26	ScruffyChat	So I haven't worked on it for a while
2016-01-14 03:42:34	Neocraftz1553	do you have it?
2016-01-14 03:43:07	Neocraftz1553	maybe I can help you
2016-01-14 03:43:20	ScruffyChat	no, I had to get rid of most of it because it took up a ton of space on my laptop
2016-01-14 03:43:28	ScruffyChat	Not all of it, but most of it
2016-01-14 03:43:36	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-14 03:43:46	Neocraftz1553	how did it look?
2016-01-14 03:43:50	ScruffyChat	And besides, I needed to rewrite it anyway because the plot to PF changed
2016-01-14 03:44:02	ScruffyChat	It used Blender Internal, which I think was my first mistake
2016-01-14 03:44:03	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-14 03:44:08	ScruffyChat	Cycles would do it more justice
2016-01-14 03:44:10	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-14 03:44:29	Neocraftz1553	sounds very advanced
2016-01-14 03:45:13	Neocraftz1553	you could probably animate spiny/spiky long legs while I could barely animate a pebble falling
2016-01-14 03:45:25	Neocraftz1553	and I'd still mess up
2016-01-14 03:45:29	ScruffyChat	Oh come now, you can do it
2016-01-14 03:45:45	ScruffyChat	I just wish there were some way to teach people to use Blender live
2016-01-14 03:45:51	ScruffyChat	Like with visuals to help me
2016-01-14 03:46:04	Neocraftz1553	like a blueprint
2016-01-14 03:46:19	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 03:46:34	Neocraftz1553	I think I could do something along those lines
2016-01-14 03:46:45	Neocraftz1553	Then I could send it to you
2016-01-14 03:47:12	Neocraftz1553	what kind of a blue print do you want?
2016-01-14 03:47:13	ScruffyChat	Yeah, but how could I show you all the stuff Blender does in real time?
2016-01-14 03:47:26	Neocraftz1553	oooh, like to a live audience
2016-01-14 03:47:30	ScruffyChat	And what do you want to learn?
2016-01-14 03:47:43	Neocraftz1553	me?
2016-01-14 03:48:09	Neocraftz1553	well, theres streaming, for one, there are other methods too
2016-01-14 03:48:56	Neocraftz1553	I personally would like to learn how to make things more realistic with blender internal
2016-01-14 03:48:59	@PikFan	19:45	ScruffyChat	I just wish there were some way to teach people to use Blender live
2016-01-14 03:49:11	@PikFan	there aren't any tutors or something of the sort out there?
2016-01-14 03:49:14	Neocraftz1553	hello pikfab
2016-01-14 03:49:19	@PikFan	or like online courses, etc?

2016-01-14 03:49:32	Neocraftz1553	yeah there are tons of them
2016-01-14 03:49:38	ScruffyChat	And there are /plenty/ of videos on Youtube
2016-01-14 03:49:56	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-14 03:49:57	Neocraftz1553	But, I haven't seen a single pikmin tutorial
2016-01-14 03:50:14	Neocraftz1553	there ARE, however, some speed models
2016-01-14 03:50:18	@PikFan	did you get Scruffy's model with the skeleton?

2016-01-14 03:51:27	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-14 03:51:38	@PikFan	but I think it'd be easier for you to use, since you were saying it's difficult
2016-01-14 03:51:45	@PikFan	or am I interpreting wrong
2016-01-14 03:51:46	Neocraftz1553	I've heard models with skeletons are easier to manipulate
2016-01-14 03:52:06	ScruffyChat	Definitely
2016-01-14 03:52:23	ScruffyChat	You'd have to spend days animating something by moving its polygons
2016-01-14 03:52:28	Neocraftz1553	nah, you got it right if you where saying it was hard to manipulate a pikmin
2016-01-14 03:52:38	Neocraftz1553	yeah, ive been there
2016-01-14 03:52:43	Neocraftz1553	tons of times

2016-01-14 03:53:49	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 03:54:00	@PikFan	19:24	PikFan	is it a desert area?
2016-01-14 03:54:16	Neocraftz1553	well, the spiny long legs battle and that other one are both connected
2016-01-14 03:54:30	Neocraftz1553	where there are clovers, theres a path there
2016-01-14 03:54:34	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-14 03:54:53	Neocraftz1553	and the scale of the pikmin are very very tiny
2016-01-14 03:55:05	@PikFan	mm, yeah
2016-01-14 03:55:14	Neocraftz1553	they are scaled X:1 Y:1 and Z:1
2016-01-14 03:56:00	ScruffyChat	woah, so that terrain is huge then
2016-01-14 03:56:01	Neocraftz1553	and outside of that there are tons of models of the spiny long legs and the huge stone long legs, as well as pikmin models
2016-01-14 03:56:14	Neocraftz1553	all doing the different things
2016-01-14 03:56:39	Neocraftz1553	it was tiring doing that
2016-01-14 03:57:05	Neocraftz1553	the terrain is kinda small, but in a sense, it is huge
2016-01-14 03:57:50	ScruffyChat	I like the material you used for the grass
2016-01-14 03:58:55	Neocraftz1553	yeah, it's solid color, but I changed the suns color a bit as well as the energy
2016-01-14 03:59:31	Neocraftz1553	there are two suns I think
2016-01-14 04:00:54	Neocraftz1553	hey, bulbminlead101 is active

2016-01-14 04:18:29	ScruffyChat	I'm fine without a sig
2016-01-14 04:18:58	Neocraftz1553	Pikfan, you should see at least 10-50 things recategorized/expanded by mid-day tommarrow
2016-01-14 04:19:26	@PikFan	heh, alright
2016-01-14 04:19:28	@PikFan	thanks
2016-01-14 04:19:33	@PikFan	oh
2016-01-14 04:19:36	Neocraftz1553	I'm trying to help the wikia out, even though theres not many users active
2016-01-14 04:19:47	Neocraftz1553	no prob
2016-01-14 04:19:49	@PikFan	if you want to start categorizing stuff, you could categorize your images
2016-01-14 04:20:03	ScruffyChat	Under "3D rendered images"
2016-01-14 04:20:07	@PikFan	put all your blender renders in— yeah
2016-01-14 04:20:09	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Category:3D_rendered_images
2016-01-14 04:20:15	Neocraftz1553	oh ok
2016-01-14 04:20:33	@PikFan	one of these days I need to create a file licensing system
2016-01-14 04:20:43	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-14 04:20:49	@PikFan	but since I have no idea how most licenses work, I'm going to need Espyo and J's help
2016-01-14 04:21:03	@PikFan	probably J moreso than Espyo, because he seems to understand licenses better
2016-01-14 04:21:10	Neocraftz1553	the guild of bulborbs arent active
2016-01-14 04:21:15	@PikFan	yeah...

2016-01-14 04:27:13	Neocraftz1553	woah sorry, page reloaded
2016-01-14 04:27:16	@PikFan	there was also this guy who had a roller (they're just giant paint rollers) who kept sneaking up and ambushing me and a few others
2016-01-14 04:27:23	@PikFan	wasn't very pleasant
2016-01-14 04:27:31	@PikFan	it's fine

2016-01-14 04:28:30	Neocraftz1553	I like sneaking up in sneakerz :P
2016-01-14 04:29:06	@PikFan	see, what this roller guy would do is he'd jump out of the ink and SLAM the roller down on us
2016-01-14 04:29:07	Neocraftz1553	hey, pikfan, what are your skillz... like blender, javascript, etc.

2016-01-14 04:29:49	@PikFan	well, my only real skill is writing
2016-01-14 04:29:58	@PikFan	other than that, I've got nothing
2016-01-14 04:30:00	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-14 04:30:11	@PikFan	I'd like to learn how to use blender but I need my own computer first
2016-01-14 04:30:36	@PikFan	I'd also like to learn a programming language sometime
2016-01-14 04:30:48	Neocraftz1553	start with javascript
2016-01-14 04:30:57	Neocraftz1553	it sounds like a coffe
2016-01-14 04:31:00	Neocraftz1553	coffe
2016-01-14 04:31:03	Neocraftz1553	coffee
2016-01-14 04:31:12	@PikFan	yeah, I know what JS is
2016-01-14 04:31:26	@PikFan	it's basically what the internet is written in
2016-01-14 04:31:33	@PikFan	...I think
2016-01-14 04:31:40	Neocraftz1553	yeah kinda
2016-01-14 04:31:44	@PikFan	well, I know lots of webpages use it
2016-01-14 04:31:49	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-01-14 04:32:21	Neocraftz1553	on my trusteh laptop, I sometimes alter the code of a webpage for fun
2016-01-14 04:33:04	Neocraftz1553	I change the colors, fiddle around with the text, and do other stuff
2016-01-14 04:33:19	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-14 04:33:24	Neocraftz1553	Scruffychat, what are your skillz
2016-01-14 04:33:31	ScruffyChat	Umm
2016-01-14 04:33:40	Neocraftz1553	it is spelled with a z, not an s
2016-01-14 04:33:45	ScruffyChat	Well I'm a musician mainly
2016-01-14 04:33:57	ScruffyChat	I compose music almost every day
2016-01-14 04:33:57	@PikFan	he's a good writer, good animator, musician...
2016-01-14 04:33:57	Neocraftz1553	k, thats 1
2016-01-14 04:34:31	Neocraftz1553	cool, I might request for a main menu theme for PRDT
2016-01-14 04:34:50	@PikFan	I'm not going to request music until I learn how to "write" in music
2016-01-14 04:34:55	Neocraftz1553	as I told Espyo, the abbreveation sounds like a disease
2016-01-14 04:35:03	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-14 04:35:03	Neocraftz1553	?
2016-01-14 04:35:23	Neocraftz1553	oh, your not taking music requests
2016-01-14 04:35:48	@PikFan	I'm not taking requests, I meant I'm not going to ask :P
2016-01-14 04:36:10	ScruffyChat	I could teach you, well, tips about writing music
2016-01-14 04:36:18	ScruffyChat	writing music can't really be taught
2016-01-14 04:36:26	ScruffyChat	The format can, but the craft cannot
2016-01-14 04:36:46	Neocraftz1553	yeah ik some basic stuff about that
2016-01-14 04:37:03	Neocraftz1553	you have to let it kinda come naturally, no?
2016-01-14 04:37:11	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-14 04:37:35	ScruffyChat	Yes, but there are plenty of tips to help with that
2016-01-14 04:37:40	@PikFan	like, I'd rather be able to ask for a specific theme the way I want it to sound instead of a random theme (no offense to you, Scruffy)
2016-01-14 04:38:20	ScruffyChat	None taken, I'd rather it be that way as well
2016-01-14 04:38:21	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-14 04:38:43	ScruffyChat	I say more power to anyone who wants to compose
2016-01-14 04:38:58	ScruffyChat	Hopefully I can provide some resources or tips to help
2016-01-14 04:39:13	Neocraftz1553	oh, scruffy, I've watched(well, heard) lots of your themes(lipidon, tutorial). I think they are awsome
2016-01-14 04:39:40	ScruffyChat	Thank you!
2016-01-14 04:39:49	Neocraftz1553	I'd also like to help a bit in pikmin forever, if you dont mind
2016-01-14 04:39:53	ScruffyChat	I just publish that stuff for fun
2016-01-14 04:39:58	ScruffyChat	Yeah, certainly!
2016-01-14 04:39:59	Neocraftz1553	rly?
2016-01-14 04:40:36	ScruffyChat	Sure
2016-01-14 04:40:37	Neocraftz1553	I'd only make the enemies and stuffy for now, cause I don't want to mess with the storyline much
2016-01-14 04:40:50	ScruffyChat	Yeah no problem
2016-01-14 04:40:52	ScruffyChat	Although
2016-01-14 04:40:55	Neocraftz1553	lol, I saw your name and wrote stuffy
2016-01-14 04:41:13	ScruffyChat	I already have an idea on what each enemy is supposed to do
2016-01-14 04:41:23	Neocraftz1553	oh...
2016-01-14 04:41:39	Neocraftz1553	I'll write the basic stuff, and then you revise it
2016-01-14 04:41:59	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-01-14 04:43:17	Neocraftz1553	you could also leave a message on my talk page to what you want certain groups of enemies to react to stuff, like bulborbs get tipped over more easily by mushroom pikmin, and snagrats get weighd down easier by purples, etv
2016-01-14 04:43:33	Neocraftz1553	sorry, misspelled some stuff
2016-01-14 04:44:00	ScruffyChat	Sure!
2016-01-14 04:44:02	ScruffyChat	It'll be a lot
2016-01-14 04:44:26	ScruffyChat	Generally Mushroom Pikmin can knock over most enemies with enough hits
2016-01-14 04:44:46	Neocraftz1553	I wouldn't mind if you write it down in a .txt document then send it to me to download
2016-01-14 04:44:49	ScruffyChat	It's like the Knuckle Seed from Pikmin Adventure, if you know what I'm talking about
2016-01-14 04:44:51	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 04:44:57	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-14 04:45:32	Neocraftz1553	even though I havent played it(sorry, I play on a SNES :P) but yeah

2016-01-14 06:22:02	ScruffyChat	I'd say it's more animal than plant

2016-01-14 06:48:48	ScruffyChat	Thanks
2016-01-14 06:49:00	ScruffyChat	I'm gonna render it at twice that size now
2016-01-14 06:49:05	@PikFan	though... there's a weird line on the Blue Pikmin
2016-01-14 06:49:06	ScruffyChat	But I noticed one thing
2016-01-14 06:49:19	@PikFan	under the guitar, on his right le
2016-01-14 06:49:21	@PikFan	*leg
2016-01-14 06:49:27	ScruffyChat	it's the wire for the guitar
2016-01-14 06:49:42	@PikFan	I see the wire, yeah
2016-01-14 06:49:50	@PikFan	but there's another, fainter line
2016-01-14 06:49:55	@PikFan	it looks like a zigzag
2016-01-14 06:50:11	@PikFan	what is that?
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	I'll change its color
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	oh wait, I see what your talking abou
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	That's a geometry problem
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	I'll see if I can work it out
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	And also I'll add the Blues Pikmin's stem
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	I forgot that
2016-01-14 06:51:43	ScruffyChat	Yeah, the zigzag is the geometry error
2016-01-14 06:51:44	ScruffyChat	It's because the model is built in triangles, and there are bones that bend the model
2016-01-14 06:51:44	ScruffyChat	But at some point, if you bend the model parts too much, you'll start to see those triangles
2016-01-14 06:51:45	ScruffyChat	Unless the model is made from millions of tiny little triangles
2016-01-14 06:52:17	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-14 06:53:02	ScruffyChat	But now that I know that's the pose I want the model in, I can apply that pose
2016-01-14 06:53:21	ScruffyChat	Meaning I can freeze it there and any changes to the skeleton no longer apply
2016-01-14 06:53:35	ScruffyChat	And then I can just smooth out the crease with sculpting tools
2016-01-14 06:54:07	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-01-14 06:54:11	ScruffyChat	Already fixed
2016-01-14 06:54:12	@PikFan	that sounds painless
2016-01-14 06:54:15	@PikFan	wow
2016-01-14 06:55:59	ScruffyChat	Is there anything else that you think needs fixing?
2016-01-14 06:56:50	@PikFan	Red Pikmin stem might be missing
2016-01-14 06:56:52	@PikFan	I can't tell
2016-01-14 06:59:32	ScruffyChat	It's there
2016-01-14 06:59:38	ScruffyChat	Blues PIkmin is in front, so that's okay
2016-01-14 06:59:55	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-01-14 07:00:18	@PikFan	hmmm... I don't see anything else
2016-01-14 07:00:20	@PikFan	looks good
2016-01-14 07:00:25	@PikFan	you've gotta post this on the forums
2016-01-14 07:00:41	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-01-14 07:00:51	ScruffyChat	Once I get the 1920x1200 version I will
2016-01-14 07:01:00	ScruffyChat	Also, I've gotta tell you what they're playing
2016-01-14 07:01:32	ScruffyChat	Blues Pikmin's playing a Gardn Les Paul Standard
2016-01-14 07:01:54	ScruffyChat	with a Dark Cherry "Almost Sundown" wood finish
2016-01-14 07:02:27	ScruffyChat	The purple Pikmin is playing a Wraith "Dream Series" J-bass
2016-01-14 07:03:29	ScruffyChat	And the Rock Pikmin rocks the Progg special edition 6-piece maple kit
2016-01-14 07:03:54	ScruffyChat	I'm not sure about the sax or keyboards yet, but I'll think of something witty
2016-01-14 07:04:02	ScruffyChat	And they're all live at the Blue Onion
2016-01-14 07:04:10	@PikFan	niiice

2016-01-14 18:56:13	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-14 18:56:18	@Espyo	right, I linked you that, because...
2016-01-14 18:56:22	@Espyo	with something SO small
2016-01-14 18:56:26	@Espyo	how did they manage to do something so... right?
2016-01-14 18:56:32	@Espyo	it feels like so much music theory went into that
2016-01-14 18:56:37	@Espyo	but it's so CONDENSED
2016-01-14 18:56:39	@Espyo	it's incredible
2016-01-14 18:56:49	Scruffy	Yeah, sound is very easy to generate
2016-01-14 18:56:59	Scruffy	In fact, it's extremely difficult /not/ to generate
2016-01-14 18:57:36	@Espyo	heh
2016-01-14 18:57:44	@Espyo	but sound that... melodious?
2016-01-14 18:57:47	@Espyo	kinda scary how simple it was
2016-01-14 18:58:36	Scruffy	It was just the speaker reading how quickly to vibrate based on how quickly the computer was told to read
2016-01-14 18:59:14	@Espyo	yeah

2016-01-14 19:00:00	@Espyo	everybody has that one time where they learn that sound is just vibrations
2016-01-14 19:00:06	@Espyo	and faster vibrations are higher pitched
2016-01-14 19:00:12	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-14 19:00:12	@Espyo	and that time is always mindblowing
2016-01-14 19:00:20	Scruffy	Pitch is just rhythm
2016-01-14 19:00:21	@Espyo	it changes how they understand sound and digital sound entirely
2016-01-14 19:00:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-14 19:00:41	@Espyo	also explains why speeding something up makes it higher pitched
2016-01-14 19:00:50	Scruffy	Exactly
2016-01-14 19:00:59	@Espyo	it's so fun! I love it
2016-01-14 19:01:09	Scruffy	It's why flies, bees, and gnats sound like constant tones

2016-01-14 19:01:17	Scruffy	You can't hear individual wing flaps
2016-01-14 19:01:22	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-01-14 19:02:02	Scruffy	In fact, if it weren't for that principle, hummingbirds might be called "beatingbirds" or some nonsense like that
2016-01-14 19:02:10	@Espyo	hehe
2016-01-14 19:02:35	Scruffy	But yeah, I never envisioned that a computer could just generate sound by processing like that
2016-01-14 19:02:51	@Espyo	a beautiful blend of math and music theory
2016-01-14 19:02:54	Scruffy	I mean, a computer generates sound no matter what, but I mean by processing data
2016-01-14 19:02:56	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-14 19:03:14	Scruffy	And then you get into harmonics and everything just gets weirder
2016-01-14 19:03:41	@Espyo	I can't remember if I ever got into learning harmonics
2016-01-14 19:03:50	@Espyo	at least the name's not familiar
2016-01-14 19:04:02	Scruffy	Their difficult to understand, and even harder to calculate
2016-01-14 19:04:05	Scruffy	But basically
2016-01-14 19:05:04	Scruffy	When you produce a sound, like plucking a string
2016-01-14 19:05:04	Scruffy	There is one frequency that is most prominent, called the fundamental frequency
2016-01-14 19:05:32	Scruffy	And then there are higher frequencies that accompany it called overtones
2016-01-14 19:05:44	@Espyo	within the same sound?
2016-01-14 19:05:49	Scruffy	Right
2016-01-14 19:05:58	Scruffy	When you here a sound, you're not just hearing one pitch
2016-01-14 19:06:15	Scruffy	You're hearing many frequencies, some higher than our threshold of hearing
2016-01-14 19:06:21	@Espyo	sorry to interrupt, but why is that?
2016-01-14 19:06:31	@Espyo	because of several microscopic factors
2016-01-14 19:06:41	@Espyo	like air resistance and just fundamental physics?
2016-01-14 19:07:01	@Espyo	like, would a computer-generated sine wave also have higher frequencies than the one that it's "meant" to have?
2016-01-14 19:08:04	Scruffy	Well, it depends on the source of the sound
2016-01-14 19:08:08	Scruffy	But think of it this way

2016-01-14 19:09:38	Scruffy	When you pluck a string, it tries to vibrate at all frequencies
2016-01-14 19:09:46	Scruffy	or at least, many frequencies
2016-01-14 19:10:04	@Espyo	unrelated to sound, yes?
2016-01-14 19:10:11	@Espyo	just the string's own natural vibration
2016-01-14 19:10:32	Scruffy	Yes, but the vibration /has/ to produce a sound, it's part of energy loss
2016-01-14 19:10:44	Scruffy	Every vibration like that produces sound waves
2016-01-14 19:10:54	Scruffy	The thing is, some of them die away very quickly
2016-01-14 19:11:03	@Espyo	right, right
2016-01-14 19:11:13	@Espyo	it's making sense so far

2016-01-14 19:11:41	Scruffy	Only a few of them actually propagate, based on their wavelength
2016-01-14 19:11:53	Scruffy	And here's the generality when it comes to strings
2016-01-14 19:12:22	Scruffy	If the wavelength of a wave can fit the length of the string evenly, it will resonate and propagate outwards to be heard
2016-01-14 19:12:33	Scruffy	So for example, if the string has length L
2016-01-14 19:12:41	@Espyo	aaahh
2016-01-14 19:12:59	Scruffy	Then its sound wave with wavelength L, or (1/2)L, or (1/3)L, will propagate
2016-01-14 19:13:56	Scruffy	But one at (2/5)L will die out, because it can't fit evenly into the length of the string
2016-01-14 19:14:16	Scruffy	This accounts for so much technique when playing an instrument
2016-01-14 19:14:59	@Espyo	right
2016-01-14 19:15:09	Scruffy	This is why, if you touch a string at its midpoint (not hold it down, just touch it), and pluck or bow it, you'll here the first overtone rather than the fundamental
2016-01-14 19:15:22	@Espyo	oh, does that explain why guitars need tuning, too?
2016-01-14 19:15:49	Scruffy	Well, that's just because over time, strings get stretched by tension
2016-01-14 19:15:59	Scruffy	But it does show something very interesting about tuning
2016-01-14 19:16:42	Scruffy	When you play two strings that are only a few Hertz of frequency apart, these fundamentals and frequencies will collide with each other and cause interference
2016-01-14 19:16:51	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-01-14 19:17:11	Scruffy	as a result, you will be able to hear a pulse
2016-01-14 19:17:34	Scruffy	This pulse is called a "beat," although it's unrelated to the normal musical term beat
2016-01-14 19:17:55	@Espyo	hm
2016-01-14 19:17:55	Scruffy	And the closer the strings are to perfectly in tune with each other, the fewer beats you will hear per second
2016-01-14 19:18:33	Scruffy	That's one easy way to tell if your guitar is in tune: play a string and the same note on a neighboring string, and listen for pulses in the combined sound
2016-01-14 19:18:52	@Espyo	right
2016-01-14 19:19:10	Scruffy	Now, one more thing about harmonics
2016-01-14 19:21:14	Scruffy	Each and every thing that produces sound has a different way of mixing its harmonics, due to many factors like material, mass, density, and other properties like that
2016-01-14 19:21:15	Scruffy	A unique combination of harmonics is called a timbre
2016-01-14 19:21:15	Scruffy	pronounced "tam-ber"
2016-01-14 19:21:15	Scruffy	And that's why every instrument has a unique voice, including human voices

2016-01-14 19:21:32	Scruffy	And that's why it's so hard to emulate instruments on computers: there are so many little imperfections and barely audible harmonics that natural instruments create

2016-01-14 19:22:06	@Espyo	that makes SO much sense

2016-01-14 19:22:42	Scruffy	thanks!
2016-01-14 19:22:49	Scruffy	That was my first time explaining harmonics
2016-01-14 19:23:04	Scruffy	And when you get into talking about different instruments it gets crazy
2016-01-14 19:23:09	@Espyo	heh, I bet
2016-01-14 19:23:36	Scruffy	But yeah, I say computers should be used for creating new sounds, not just mimicking natural ones
2016-01-14 19:23:46	@Espyo	right
2016-01-14 19:23:52	@Espyo	...unless you're on a tight budget :|

2016-01-14 20:19:33	@Espyo	I'll just put it on dropbox, no worries

2016-01-14 20:19:56	@Espyo	 1024x1024?
2016-01-14 20:19:59	Scruffy	Yes
2016-01-14 20:20:24	@Espyo	uh... would 1024x453 work?
2016-01-14 20:20:28	Scruffy	Yeah

2016-01-14 20:21:09	@Espyo	yeah, I think 2048 would be better

2016-01-14 20:22:59	Scruffy	oh i see
2016-01-14 20:23:13	Scruffy	So, how would you suggest I fix it?
2016-01-14 20:23:23	Scruffy	Add back in the black outline?
2016-01-14 20:24:20	@Espyo	oh, no
2016-01-14 20:24:24	@Espyo	just use this instead of the 1 you had
2016-01-14 20:24:29	@Espyo	which was a bit pixelly too
2016-01-14 20:24:32	@Espyo	on the ramp part at the top-left
2016-01-14 20:24:49	Scruffy	Oh I see
2016-01-14 20:25:14	Scruffy	Thanks!
2016-01-14 20:25:16	Scruffy	Will do
2016-01-14 20:25:22	@Espyo	no problem
2016-01-14 20:25:27	Yoshi2	ok, after looking at the filesystem of battalion wars, I remember why I called it nuts
2016-01-14 20:25:58	Yoshi2	it doesn't have separate directories for storing models/textures
2016-01-14 20:26:22	Yoshi2	instead, there is a "CompoundFiles" directory which is very huge
2016-01-14 20:26:31	Yoshi2	so I guess it contains everything
2016-01-14 20:27:05	@J	I don't really know what I'm looking at, but it's amazing
2016-01-14 20:27:17	Yoshi2	and that directory has various archive files with the names of the levels 
2016-01-14 20:27:37	Scruffy	J: Someone requested a picture of a "blues Pikmin"
2016-01-14 20:27:37	@J	is that actually a Pikmin on drums?  There's some weird texture where the face should be
2016-01-14 20:28:06	Scruffy	Since the message for Blue Onions in the first game reads "There are no blues Pikmin to take out"
2016-01-14 20:28:16	Scruffy	It's a Rock Pikmin on drums
2016-01-14 20:28:20	@J	also for some reason I didn't notice the Red Pikmin for ages, no idea why
2016-01-14 20:29:12	Yoshi2	Espyo: so basically, it seems battalion wars stores all the models INSIDE the level data archives
2016-01-14 20:29:54	Yoshi2	so in theory, there might be lots of duplicate data because each level has its own collection of models they use
2016-01-14 20:29:57	@J	Metroid Prime is similar; it has around 9 files with all the stuff inside

2016-01-14 20:32:03	Yoshi2	I'd really love to take apart those archives
2016-01-14 20:33:30	Yoshi2	I'll get down to that eventually, I guess
2016-01-14 20:36:54	@Espyo	that is terrifying, Yoshi2
2016-01-14 20:37:00	@Espyo	but like
2016-01-14 20:37:08	@Espyo	does it store ALL models inside the level data archives?
2016-01-14 20:37:14	@Espyo	or just the models of the objects that will be used there?
2016-01-14 20:37:20	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-14 20:37:24	@Espyo	you explain in the very next message
2016-01-14 20:37:25	@Espyo	sorry
2016-01-14 20:37:33	@Espyo	yeah, I'm starting to see more and more games do that
2016-01-14 20:37:40	@Espyo	Skyward Sword did that
2016-01-14 20:37:44	@Espyo	Pikmin 3 does that
2016-01-14 20:38:08	Yoshi2	would be interesting to know which files they contain that aren't used in the level
2016-01-14 20:38:17	@Espyo	yeah
2016-01-14 20:38:27	@Espyo	also have fun figuring out if there are differences
2016-01-14 20:38:35	@Espyo	I know Pikmin 3 has differences
2016-01-14 20:38:47	@Espyo	recently I added to the wiki the fact that an enemy has a different... something on one of the levels
2016-01-14 20:38:53	@Espyo	I just discovered that by chance
2016-01-14 20:38:57	@Espyo	chances are it's not the only one
2016-01-14 20:39:05	@Espyo	I am SURE AS HELL not figuring out all of them
2016-01-14 20:39:08	@Espyo	it'd take years

2016-01-14 20:48:48	@Espyo	I remember now
2016-01-14 20:48:53	@Espyo	and I found it http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bug-Eyed_Crawmad&diff=prev&oldid=157839
2016-01-14 20:49:08	@Espyo	the Bug-Eyed Crawmad on the Fortress of Festivity really IS weaker than the rest
2016-01-14 20:49:21	@Espyo	its files inside the FoF archives specify this data
2016-01-14 20:49:29	Yoshi2	differences would take a long time, but finding unused entities should be easier
2016-01-14 20:49:30	@Espyo	thing is, if the files ONLY contained the differences, it'd be easy
2016-01-14 20:49:34	@Espyo	but it contains everything from scratch
2016-01-14 20:49:40	@Espyo	a duplicate of what's on the usual enemy folder
2016-01-14 20:49:47	@Espyo	hm, it should
2016-01-14 20:49:54	@Espyo	anyway, it makes sense that games would do this
2016-01-14 20:49:59	@Espyo	less loading time
2016-01-14 20:50:06	@Espyo	but I REALLY wonder just how smart this is
2016-01-14 20:50:14	@Espyo	for one thing, it opens up all sorts of synch problems
2016-01-14 20:50:19	@Espyo	"oh, this enemy has this glitch, fix it"
2016-01-14 20:50:27	@Espyo	they do, but forget to update the enemy data inside the levels
2016-01-14 20:50:33	@Espyo	plus, it increases the game's total size
2016-01-14 20:50:40	@Espyo	which is... kind of important for a downloadable title like Pikmin 3
2016-01-14 20:50:55	Yoshi2	it's kinda like using functions versus in-line'ing the code
2016-01-14 20:51:03	@Espyo	exactly!

2016-01-14 20:54:06	Scruffy	Do you think you could send me a second version of that texture
2016-01-14 20:54:15	@Espyo	uhm, sure
2016-01-14 20:54:20	Scruffy	That has some empty space around it?
2016-01-14 20:54:21	@Espyo	still have Inkscape open, so hurray
2016-01-14 20:54:33	@Espyo	oh, that should be easy

2016-01-14 20:54:52	Scruffy	Blender's not cooperating at keeping this texture from tiling
2016-01-14 20:55:13	Scruffy	With more space around it it should work easier
2016-01-14 20:55:26	Scruffy	Oh also I learned today how to change the debt value and gravity in Pikmin 2
2016-01-14 20:55:31	Scruffy	It's so much fun
2016-01-14 20:55:52	Scruffy	I realized that Pikmin 3 has stronger gravity than the first two, at least when it comes to Pikmin

2016-01-14 20:56:35	@Espyo	yeah, definitely does

2016-01-14 21:39:09	Yoshi2	yup, definitely needs a deserializer

2016-01-14 21:46:19	@Espyo	I love how in visual studio, if you accidentally delete a semicolon, it INSTANTLY marks the entire file from there on out in red
2016-01-14 21:46:31	@Espyo	but if you put the semicolon back, it needs a good 30 seconds to parse the file and realize everything's ok

2016-01-15 00:24:14	Scruffy	I just finished this today, after a couple more hours of tweaking
2016-01-15 00:24:18	Scruffy	http://pikipedia.freeforums.net/attachment/download/25
2016-01-15 00:24:21	@PikFan	I wanted to ask him about licensing again
2016-01-15 00:24:29	@PikFan	yeah, I saw
2016-01-15 00:24:46	@PikFan	I'm still amazed by it
2016-01-15 00:25:07	Scruffy	Thanks
2016-01-15 00:25:20	Scruffy	Espyo helped me iron out some kinks
2016-01-15 00:25:24	@PikFan	oh, since you put this on Fanon, you should puf it up on your userpage
2016-01-15 00:25:32	@PikFan	ah, such as...?
2016-01-15 00:25:48	@PikFan	*put
2016-01-15 00:25:48	Scruffy	The Yellow Pikmin's leaf was low-res from Pikmin 2
2016-01-15 00:26:08	Scruffy	And so was the "1" logo on the bass drum
2016-01-15 00:26:20	Scruffy	Now they're both higher res
2016-01-15 00:26:28	@PikFan	mmm
2016-01-15 00:27:34	Scruffy	and also I changed the color of the drums for the Rock Pikmin, since all the other instruments (besides the guitar) are color coordinated
2016-01-15 00:28:12	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-15 00:29:23	@PikFan	wait
2016-01-15 00:29:51	Scruffy	mhm?
2016-01-15 00:29:52	@PikFan	didn't you say at one point that the Blue Pikmin was missing the guitar pick?
2016-01-15 00:30:00	Scruffy	It's there now
2016-01-15 00:30:14	Scruffy	It's hard to see but it's in his hand
2016-01-15 00:31:20	@PikFan	I'm...not seeing it
2016-01-15 00:31:35	@PikFan	is it supposed to be in his left hand?
2016-01-15 00:32:36	Scruffy	No, right hand
2016-01-15 00:32:47	Scruffy	right above the first pickup
2016-01-15 00:33:00	Scruffy	it's between his fingers
2016-01-15 00:33:22	Scruffy	It's a similar color to the guitar, I know
2016-01-15 00:33:56	@PikFan	oh I see it now
2016-01-15 00:34:25	@PikFan	that's what I meant by left—OUR left, not his left, heh
2016-01-15 00:35:00	Scruffy	Oh heh
2016-01-15 00:35:35	Scruffy	Yeah, I added it in, I probably should have made it a more prominent color
2016-01-15 00:35:44	Scruffy	Considering it's the very center of the image
2016-01-15 00:35:48	Scruffy	Rule of thirds, I guess
2016-01-15 00:37:04	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-15 00:39:05	Scruffy	So how's the coup coming?
2016-01-15 00:39:42	@PikFan	haven't thought about it much since yesterday
2016-01-15 00:39:51	@PikFan	hmm
2016-01-15 00:40:14	@PikFan	though... am I making things escalate too quickly?
2016-01-15 00:40:42	@PikFan	15 chapters in and we have a whole nation falling
2016-01-15 00:40:52	Scruffy	That's 15 chapters though
2016-01-15 00:40:53	@PikFan	that's pretty intense
2016-01-15 00:40:57	Scruffy	you have a lot of words to go
2016-01-15 00:41:03	@PikFan	true
2016-01-15 00:41:03	Scruffy	I think you have plenty of time
2016-01-15 00:41:20	@PikFan	assuming they average at 3k words
2016-01-15 00:41:28	Scruffy	If this is to be the epic sort of epic you're thinking, your pacing is fine right now
2016-01-15 00:41:43	@PikFan	ah, okay
2016-01-15 00:44:01	@PikFan	I wonder what I should do when they reach the parallel world...
2016-01-15 00:44:57	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-15 00:45:27	@PikFan	though, it's not just Pikmin that'll have counterparts
2016-01-15 00:45:38	@PikFan	I think enemies will, too
2016-01-15 00:45:53	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-01-15 00:46:50	@PikFan	perhaps some enemies won't even have counterparts
2016-01-15 00:47:10	@PikFan	they'll just be replaced by completey unique ones
2016-01-15 00:47:26	@PikFan	*completely
2016-01-15 00:48:20	@PikFan	by the way, I have to get going in 15 minutes, just so you know
2016-01-15 00:49:05	Scruffy	Oh ok
2016-01-15 00:49:35	Scruffy	So, not just like a Cyan Bulborb?
2016-01-15 00:50:05	@PikFan	Bulborbs will have counterparts
2016-01-15 00:50:21	@PikFan	I'm thinking rarer, more obscure enemies
2016-01-15 00:50:39	@PikFan	will have replacements, I mean
2016-01-15 00:51:08	@PikFan	...really should express complete thoughts in one line
2016-01-15 00:51:40	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-01-15 00:53:30	@PikFan	hm
2016-01-15 00:54:32	Scruffy	Would those enemies be... friends
2016-01-15 00:54:57	@PikFan	that's an interesting idea
2016-01-15 00:55:37	@PikFan	I've always envisioned the parallel world as more spiritual and peaceful
2016-01-15 00:55:55	@PikFan	so yeah, maybe the Pikmin and creatures are friends
2016-01-15 00:56:14	Scruffy	cool
2016-01-15 00:56:23	@PikFan	some of the creatures, anyway, there will probably still be hostile ones
2016-01-15 00:56:33	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-01-15 00:56:50	Scruffy	So then might the docile ones be hostile?
2016-01-15 00:57:04	@PikFan	perhaps
2016-01-15 00:57:20	@PikFan	ugh...
2016-01-15 00:57:27	Scruffy	Like dangerous Honeywisps?
2016-01-15 00:57:38	@PikFan	I've got everything planned out all up to the escape
2016-01-15 00:57:45	@PikFan	yeah, sure
2016-01-15 00:57:50	Scruffy	Heh
2016-01-15 00:58:06	@PikFan	I'm not sure what the ending will be
2016-01-15 00:58:36	@PikFan	well, maybe I should focus on what I already have
2016-01-15 00:59:28	Scruffy	No, actually, it's good to have an end in sight toward which you can write
2016-01-15 00:59:53	Scruffy	It's a practice in music composition I recently learned about that's very important
2016-01-15 01:00:10	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-15 01:00:19	Scruffy	Compose the end or most important parts first, then you have something to work towards and connect
2016-01-15 01:00:54	Scruffy	I'm conflicted; I would like to help with the ending, but I don't wanna spoil it
2016-01-15 01:00:56	Scruffy	for me
2016-01-15 01:01:12	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-15 01:01:45	@PikFan	hmm...
2016-01-15 01:02:19	@PikFan	well, I know for sure that at the conclusion, the Onions will have served their purpose
2016-01-15 01:02:33	@PikFan	they will not be used any longer
2016-01-15 01:03:29	Scruffy	woah, really
2016-01-15 01:04:21	@PikFan	yeah, like I said, Onions vs Pikmin isn't going away
2016-01-15 01:04:39	@PikFan	oh shoot, gotta go now, sorry
2016-01-15 01:04:44	Scruffy	Oh, right
2016-01-15 01:04:46	Scruffy	see ya
2016-01-15 01:04:50	Scruffy	will you be on later?
2016-01-15 01:04:57	@PikFan	we can talk tomorrow if that works
2016-01-15 01:05:02	Scruffy	sure, I think
2016-01-15 01:05:03	Scruffy	maybe
2016-01-15 01:05:26	@PikFan	okay

2016-01-15 19:06:49	@J	hi
2016-01-15 19:17:36	@Espyo	hi
2016-01-15 19:38:47	Yoshi2	today I decided to check if anybody did some progress on battalion wars modding
2016-01-15 19:39:04	Yoshi2	on the one hand, I am not the first one to think of modding it
2016-01-15 19:39:15	Yoshi2	on the other hand, the ones that made some progress on it didn't get that far
2016-01-15 19:41:56	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-01-15 19:54:05	Yoshi2	they did manage to take control of various units, especially enemy units, though
2016-01-15 19:54:44	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-01-15 19:56:08	Yoshi2	so here's the fun part about how soldiers work:
2016-01-15 19:58:06	Yoshi2	the XML file defines a TroopBase, GroundVehicleBase, AirVehicleBase for the various foot soldier, vehicle and helicopter/plane types in the game 
2016-01-15 19:58:32	Yoshi2	those bases have things like the animation, walk speed, model, etc. etc. etc.
2016-01-15 19:59:14	Yoshi2	and then the XML file defines Troop, GroundVehicle, AirVehicle objects which are basically instances of those base classes with specific positions, AI settings and other stuff
2016-01-15 19:59:42	@Espyo	hm, makes sense
2016-01-15 19:59:46	Yoshi2	so the XML files used by the game are quite powerful
2016-01-15 20:00:07	Yoshi2	the developers surely have a proper editor for them
2016-01-15 20:02:54	Yoshi2	the game actually has a lot of modding potential with this
2016-01-15 20:03:07	@Espyo	it sure does

2016-01-15 20:08:41	Neocraftz1553	I might be able to add in some stuff into the engine
2016-01-15 20:08:59	Neocraftz1553	The crystal node and spotcaps
2016-01-15 20:09:11	Neocraftz1553	And maybe scruffys mesh fence gates
2016-01-15 20:09:17	Yoshi2	I'm really suprised battalion wars doesn't seem to have such a big following, I think the games are really well made
2016-01-15 20:09:48	@Espyo	hm, they might be easier to add when I implement hazards
2016-01-15 20:09:51	@Espyo	but go for it!
2016-01-15 20:10:06	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-01-15 20:10:35	Neocraftz1553	I could send them to you once finished so you could adjust themand see how I did it

2016-01-15 20:12:27	Neocraftz1553	Put them under 'gates'

2016-01-15 20:25:46	Yoshi2	testing what all the attributes for the objects do is a pain
2016-01-15 20:26:32	@Espyo	that's why most of the Pikmin 2 enemy pages on the wiki have hundreds of question marks on their technical information section
2016-01-15 20:26:45	@Espyo	but it's SO worth it, if you can find the right parameters

2016-01-15 20:29:58	Yoshi2	that looks quite hilarious
2016-01-15 20:31:34	Yoshi2	I'm actually curious now, I wonder if I can overwrite attributes set in the base class

2016-01-15 20:34:50	Yoshi2	seems like I cannot overwrite attributes of the base class, quite a shame
2016-01-15 20:37:03	En_Passant	base class of what?
2016-01-15 20:38:12	Yoshi2	En_Passant: battalion wars defines units in such a way that there is a Base object which has all the main info like model, animations, textures, damage, etc.
2016-01-15 20:38:37	Yoshi2	and then there are many objects which are just instances of that base class but with position info, and some other minor stuff

2016-01-15 20:46:41	Yoshi2	I can set the Y value of a unit for some reason
2016-01-15 20:47:07	Yoshi2	it means they will be forced to that height every time they hit the ground
2016-01-15 20:47:23	Yoshi2	so when you set the value for soldiers, they look like they jump up and down
2016-01-15 20:48:47	@Espyo	that's dumb
2016-01-15 20:49:25	Yoshi2	maybe it is meant for air vehicles
2016-01-15 20:49:45	@Espyo	oh, that might be it
2016-01-15 20:49:51	@Espyo	if they aren't affected by gravity
2016-01-15 20:59:49	Yoshi2	sadly, I can't shoot if I am jumping up and down all the time, so I need something more controllable

2016-01-15 21:06:26	Yoshi2	wb
2016-01-15 21:09:50	Yoshi2	interesting, BW1 seems to have references to a multiplayer mode
2016-01-15 21:09:58	Yoshi2	there are values for a multiplayer camera defined
2016-01-15 21:10:10	@Espyo	ah, nice
2016-01-15 21:10:26	Yoshi2	multiplayer was only introduced in BW2 on the Wii
2016-01-15 21:10:29	@Espyo	so that's Super Mario Sunshine, Battalion Wars 1, and Pikmin 1, supposedly

2016-01-15 21:12:16	@Espyo	well, you can play with Wiimmfi's server
2016-01-15 21:13:06	@Espyo	oh, guess Wiimm removed support for most games
2016-01-15 21:13:12	@Espyo	awww, he removed support for Smash
2016-01-15 21:13:15	@Espyo	RIP :(

2016-01-15 21:13:36	En_Passant	And Sonic Adventure 2
2016-01-15 21:13:51	@Espyo	yeah, people found a way to create their own servers for Wii games after NWFC shut down
2016-01-15 21:13:56	@Espyo	and with simple homebrew, you could connect to it
2016-01-15 21:14:14	@Espyo	that guy is a hero to me and a few friends, since we could keep playing Brawl after NWFC died

2016-01-15 21:16:21	@Espyo	didn't 7 use NWFC though?
2016-01-15 21:17:37	Yoshi2	http://wiimm.de/3ds/mk7/index.html the page says that he will put together information for MK7, and right now he put up statistics for the drivers and cars
2016-01-15 21:17:53	@Espyo	oh
2016-01-15 21:17:55	@Espyo	well then
2016-01-15 21:19:26	En_Passant	7 uses NWFC, but it's for 3DS so they didn't shut down the servers
2016-01-15 21:19:42	@Espyo	right
2016-01-15 21:24:35	Yoshi2	I'd be suprised if MK7 was already unplayable online because it is a fairly recent game
2016-01-15 21:38:55	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-01-15 21:44:59	Yoshi2	I have a nice little framework for parsing the xml file into python objects and changing the stuff
2016-01-15 21:45:11	Yoshi2	now if only I knew how to do a GUI, I could make a proper tool out of this

2016-01-15 21:48:09	Yoshi2	although the GUI would probably be less powerful or take more effort to make as powerful as what I have right now
2016-01-15 21:49:12	Yoshi2	searching for specific objects by conditions is very nice
2016-01-15 21:52:00	Yoshi2	and editing them

2016-01-15 23:42:56	Neocraftz1553	so, I am trying to make the plastic mesh fence from your game in the pikmin fangame engine, scruffy
2016-01-15 23:43:30	Scruffy	Ooh
2016-01-15 23:44:09	Scruffy	I would think you could craft it to be like a bridge
2016-01-15 23:44:24	Scruffy	Except instead of health, it would be weight
2016-01-15 23:44:53	Neocraftz1553	yes, that is what I thought at first, but it is much harder
2016-01-15 23:44:57	Scruffy	Oh
2016-01-15 23:45:08	@Espyo	there's no code for "weight-type" obstacles yet
2016-01-15 23:45:20	Neocraftz1553	yeah, ik
2016-01-15 23:45:27	@Espyo	and even if there was, I don't think I'd implement it for bridges, I'm afraid
2016-01-15 23:45:37	@Espyo	thing is, I gotta aim for what the Pikmin games do
2016-01-15 23:45:42	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-15 23:45:42	@Espyo	but make it flexible
2016-01-15 23:45:49	@Espyo	combinations and specific behaviors can be added afterwards
2016-01-15 23:45:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-01-15 23:45:59	@Espyo	but only if the request is big, simple, and will pay off
2016-01-15 23:46:03	@Espyo	otherwise, I'll only stick with the basics
2016-01-15 23:46:11	@Espyo	or I'd never finish the engine, ever..
2016-01-15 23:46:12	@Espyo	*...
2016-01-15 23:46:44	Scruffy	The idea of the metal mesh fence I made was that it'd be a gate, but Pikmin would cling to it and climb to the top
2016-01-15 23:47:00	Neocraftz1553	hey espyo, is it possible to change the material the bridge "outputs"
2016-01-15 23:47:04	Scruffy	When the weight limit was surpassed, it would topple into a bridge
2016-01-15 23:47:34	Neocraftz1553	like, when it is destroyed, it lays down rock instead of the bridge texture
2016-01-15 23:47:52	@Espyo	nope, not possible, sorry
2016-01-15 23:47:54	Neocraftz1553	not that I would use rock, something like "mesh gate.png"
2016-01-15 23:47:57	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-15 23:48:08	@Espyo	maybe one day? but there's no good place to do it in
2016-01-15 23:48:13	@Espyo	you have the "tag" field on the sector
2016-01-15 23:48:19	@Espyo	but that's already used for the floor height of the bridge
2016-01-15 23:48:26	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-15 23:49:06	Neocraftz1553	what if in the future it is possible to input spmething like "h: 100, tex: bridge.png"
2016-01-15 23:49:31	@Espyo	yeah, that would work
2016-01-15 23:49:47	@Espyo	but I'm afraid I'll have to make that feature low-priority

2016-01-15 23:52:19	Neocraftz1553	how do you put backgrounds in the actual game?!?
2016-01-15 23:52:34	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-01-15 23:52:35	@Espyo	good to know
2016-01-15 23:53:05	Scruffy	in the area's txt file you add bg_bmp=image.png
2016-01-15 23:53:06	StarWolf	Excuse me but... I need a bit of help...
2016-01-15 23:53:15	Scruffy	Sure! What's up?
2016-01-15 23:53:17	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-01-15 23:54:15	StarWolf	I'm working on a Boss article and I really don't know what to put down.
2016-01-15 23:54:40	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-01-15 23:55:38	StarWolf	I was able to get a little bit down, but that's it.
2016-01-15 23:56:08	Neocraftz1553	can you link to the article
2016-01-15 23:56:26	StarWolf	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Wolpin
2016-01-15 23:57:22	Neocraftz1553	It looks good.... but I am guessing you want it a higher quality, yes?
2016-01-15 23:58:21	StarWolf	And longer, with the new policy on short articles and all.
2016-01-15 23:58:22	En_Passant	I was quite surprised that you made a Japanese name for it
2016-01-15 23:58:32	En_Passant	Also, hi
2016-01-15 23:58:40	StarWolf	hoi
2016-01-15 23:58:44	Neocraftz1553	hey En_Passent
2016-01-15 23:58:56	Scruffy	Hi En_Passant
2016-01-15 23:59:37	StarWolf	I just typed some cool-sounding(ish) thing into google translate XD
2016-01-15 23:59:39	Neocraftz1553	you should add a bit more "extra" detail(like sagittarius notes and such) and write down how it affects the story, and if it ever appears again.
2016-01-15 23:59:56	Neocraftz1553	at least, thats my advice
2016-01-16 00:00:10	StarWolf	Hmm... Okay. 
2016-01-16 00:00:26	En_Passant	I would describe what sorts of attacks it has
2016-01-16 00:00:49	En_Passant	They're mentioned in the strategy, but it's harder to picture if we don't know what the attacks you're avoiding do
2016-01-16 00:01:54	StarWolf	Should I add a new section for them or just add them to the "Strategy"?

2016-01-16 00:03:45	Neocraftz1553	I remember back then
2016-01-16 00:03:47	@PikFan	plus if the Pikmin Wiki folk were in here, there'd be some great discussions going on
2016-01-16 00:03:53	Neocraftz1553	 100's of years ago
2016-01-16 00:04:01	@Espyo	funny you should mention that
2016-01-16 00:04:06	@Espyo	they just had a really heated debate on politics
2016-01-16 00:04:07	@PikFan	hi Espyo
2016-01-16 00:04:10	@Espyo	a LOT of flaming happened
2016-01-16 00:04:13	@Espyo	I was asked to step in
2016-01-16 00:04:17	StarWolf	Well it's a Friday night :3
2016-01-16 00:04:18	En_Passant	lol
2016-01-16 00:04:22	@Espyo	...somehow, I only asked them to please stop, and they just did
2016-01-16 00:04:27	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:04:29	@Espyo	never in my life has something gone that wlel
2016-01-16 00:04:30	@Espyo	*well
2016-01-16 00:04:35	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-16 00:04:40	@PikFan	well, they know you're the boss
2016-01-16 00:04:45	@Espyo	guess so
2016-01-16 00:04:48	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-01-16 00:04:55	En_Passant	They probably didn't realize how heated it was until you said something
2016-01-16 00:04:55	@Espyo	not like I'm a ruler though
2016-01-16 00:05:03	@Espyo	yeah, maybe
2016-01-16 00:05:07	@Espyo	'cause they agreed right away
2016-01-16 00:05:15	@Espyo	they realized after I said it
2016-01-16 00:05:24	@Espyo	well, anyway, I'll finish cleaning up the code tomorow
2016-01-16 00:05:25	@Espyo	*tomorrow
2016-01-16 00:05:27	@PikFan	code?
2016-01-16 00:05:29	@Espyo	I am SO close to being done
2016-01-16 00:05:30	@PikFan	for the engine?
2016-01-16 00:05:32	@Espyo	wall collisions and sliding
2016-01-16 00:05:40	@Espyo	it's FINALLY working like I want it to
2016-01-16 00:05:56	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 00:06:05	StarWolf	Yay

2016-01-16 00:07:15	<--	Espyo (Espyo@l29-294-99-37.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-01-16 00:07:17	En_Passant	Shout-outs to the color variety

2016-01-16 00:07:30	<--	Testyo (Testyo@l29-294-99-37.cpe.netcabo.pt) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-01-16 00:07:36	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 00:07:47	@PikFan	well, as the creator of my Red Pikmin OCs, it's only fitting I use red
2016-01-16 00:08:08	En_Passant	But you're also the creator of your Yellow and Blue OCs, too
2016-01-16 00:08:08	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:08:10	@PikFan	wait are StarWolf and Neocraftz1553 both using purple
2016-01-16 00:08:17	Neocraftz1553	no
2016-01-16 00:08:21	En_Passant	I think Star's using maroon
2016-01-16 00:08:24	@PikFan	that is true, but I haven't made them yet
2016-01-16 00:08:32	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 00:08:34	@PikFan	...that can't be right
2016-01-16 00:08:34	Neocraftz1553	dark red
2016-01-16 00:08:40	@PikFan	I SWEAR it looks like purple
2016-01-16 00:08:46	@PikFan	eh, maybe my eyes are bad
2016-01-16 00:08:48	En_Passant	Maroon is red-purple, so they're pretty similar
2016-01-16 00:08:49	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 00:09:02	Neocraftz1553	dark red
2016-01-16 00:09:08	Neocraftz1553	and purble
2016-01-16 00:09:12	@PikFan	oh hmm
2016-01-16 00:09:13	Neocraftz1553	very similer
2016-01-16 00:09:18	@PikFan	I see it now, but just faintly
2016-01-16 00:09:54	En_Passant	Bright red's actually quite an obnoxious color
2016-01-16 00:09:55	@PikFan	ok, so we were talking about the engine before I got on
2016-01-16 00:09:57	@PikFan	anything else?
2016-01-16 00:10:02	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:10:05	@PikFan	the red I'm using?
2016-01-16 00:10:09	En_Passant	ye
2016-01-16 00:10:16	Neocraftz1553	I kinda like it
2016-01-16 00:10:26	En_Passant	Highly contrasts the darker colors everyone else is using
2016-01-16 00:10:33	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-01-16 00:10:40	Scruffy	brb
2016-01-16 00:10:42	@PikFan	it highlights my...differences, you could say
2016-01-16 00:10:49	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 00:10:51	@PikFan	at the lack of a better word
2016-01-16 00:10:55	@PikFan	now he's blue
2016-01-16 00:10:57	@PikFan	colors
2016-01-16 00:11:00	@PikFan	colors everywhere
2016-01-16 00:11:04	Neocraftz1553	hey, I might use this color now
2016-01-16 00:11:09	Neocraftz1553	I like it
2016-01-16 00:11:13	StarWolf	it is pretty
2016-01-16 00:11:13	@PikFan	neato
2016-01-16 00:11:17	En_Passant	that's so weird
2016-01-16 00:11:21	@PikFan	?
2016-01-16 00:11:26	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 00:11:30	En_Passant	I'm using a program that yellow-shifts my screen at night
2016-01-16 00:11:40	En_Passant	So your blue looks like the color of our usernames
2016-01-16 00:11:50	@PikFan	wow, that is weird
2016-01-16 00:11:51	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:12:01	Neocraftz1553	 1
2016-01-16 00:12:01	@PikFan	but why is your computer screen yellow-shifted at night?
2016-01-16 00:12:09	Neocraftz1553	 2
2016-01-16 00:12:22	@PikFan	Scruffy: ok
2016-01-16 00:12:25	Neocraftz1553	blue light filter
2016-01-16 00:12:25	@PikFan	//late
2016-01-16 00:12:38	En_Passant	It lessens the strains on our eyes by matching the color of indoor lighting
2016-01-16 00:12:39	Neocraftz1553	whoops wrong blue
2016-01-16 00:12:42	@PikFan	ah
2016-01-16 00:12:45	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-01-16 00:12:47	@PikFan	eugh, that cyan though
2016-01-16 00:12:51	Neocraftz1553	ik
2016-01-16 00:13:35	Neocraftz1553	I use a blue-light filter on my phone when its late
2016-01-16 00:13:58	Neocraftz1553	kinda like what En_Passent uses
2016-01-16 00:13:58	@PikFan	I see
2016-01-16 00:14:15	Neocraftz1553	misspelled En_Passant
2016-01-16 00:14:38	En_Passant	thank you, that was the second time and I didn't want to rudely point it out
2016-01-16 00:14:50	Neocraftz1553	eh, its not rude
2016-01-16 00:14:55	Neocraftz1553	at least, not to me
2016-01-16 00:16:48	Neocraftz1553	ah, so much nostalgia
2016-01-16 00:16:56	@PikFan	speaking of awful colors, here, take a look http://i.imgur.com/41vhjxl.png
2016-01-16 00:17:04	Neocraftz1553	listening to the Forest of Hope
2016-01-16 00:17:29	Neocraftz1553	ugh
2016-01-16 00:17:32	StarWolf	Sorry to interrupt, but I'm not for sure how to add Sagittarius's notes to the boss page 
2016-01-16 00:17:52	Neocraftz1553	what do you mean?
2016-01-16 00:17:57	@PikFan	boss page?
2016-01-16 00:18:28	Neocraftz1553	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Wolpin
2016-01-16 00:18:50	@PikFan	it should be easy
2016-01-16 00:19:12	@PikFan	you just make a new section saying "Sagittarius's notes" and then write the notes easy
2016-01-16 00:19:20	@PikFan	or are you trying to do it another way?
2016-01-16 00:19:38	Neocraftz1553	like so: ==Sagittarius's notes==
2016-01-16 00:19:51	StarWolf	M' Kay
2016-01-16 00:20:19	Neocraftz1553	and then put "This fearsome beast is half wolf and half scorpian etc."
2016-01-16 00:20:27	@PikFan	yeah
2016-01-16 00:20:28	En_Passant	scorpion
2016-01-16 00:20:32	Neocraftz1553	thats how most people do it
2016-01-16 00:20:40	Neocraftz1553	sorry, I write fast
2016-01-16 00:20:54	@PikFan	heh
2016-01-16 00:21:06	Neocraftz1553	just noticed that mistake
2016-01-16 00:21:17	Neocraftz1553	dun, dun, dun
2016-01-16 00:21:20	@PikFan	hey, StarWold

2016-01-16 00:21:55	StarWolf	yes! It was very good :3
2016-01-16 00:22:03	@PikFan	yay, thanks
2016-01-16 00:22:28	@PikFan	ok so, looks like you all like my story, plus Pikifan7 and Pikminfan27
2016-01-16 00:23:07	StarWolf	There is something i want to say... nothing bad, just something I found funny
2016-01-16 00:23:49	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-01-16 00:26:04	StarWolf	The way that the pikmin scream out they're Elm attacks... It reminds me of a anime I had seen, like two episodes of XD 
2016-01-16 00:26:39	@PikFan	yeah, it's kinda meant to be like anime, hehe
2016-01-16 00:26:43	@PikFan	which one?
2016-01-16 00:26:54	StarWolf	Sailor Moon XD
2016-01-16 00:27:02	@PikFan	ah, nice
2016-01-16 00:27:20	Scruffy	back
2016-01-16 00:27:29	Neocraftz1553	hey, uh, does anyone have the fangame engine?
2016-01-16 00:27:29	@PikFan	hi

2016-01-16 00:27:36	@PikFan	I don't, sorry
2016-01-16 00:27:40	StarWolf	nerp
2016-01-16 00:27:47	Neocraftz1553	hey scruffy
2016-01-16 00:27:55	Scruffy	Hi!
2016-01-16 00:28:21	Neocraftz1553	oh, ok, just asking
2016-01-16 00:29:15	-->	Miles (Miles@w-18-3-19-639.hsd7.ga.comcast.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-01-16 00:29:21	StarWolf	I think I fixed the Wolpin page :3
2016-01-16 00:30:21	Neocraftz1553	does any of you have a favorite pikmin music that plays on areas? sorry for the random questions
2016-01-16 00:30:48	@PikFan	hm...

2016-01-16 00:31:03	@PikFan	well, I like the collecting treasures variation of Perplexing Pool
2016-01-16 00:31:15	@PikFan	the Louie version, too
2016-01-16 00:31:35	En_Passant	I like the enemy version
2016-01-16 00:31:44	En_Passant	For the longest time, I thought that was the standard version
2016-01-16 00:31:51	Neocraftz1553	lol
2016-01-16 00:31:57	@PikFan	enemy version?
2016-01-16 00:32:12	Neocraftz1553	when your attacking/being attacked
2016-01-16 00:32:25	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-01-16 00:32:28	@PikFan	ugh I'm dumb
2016-01-16 00:32:36	En_Passant	Also, Frontier Cavern's music
2016-01-16 00:32:38	Neocraftz1553	I think I like the Whistful Wild "Normal" variation from P2
2016-01-16 00:32:58	StarWolf	Probably the Formidable Oak. It has dark, ominous music with a scene of doom, and (at least on rainy days) higher notes that shine a glimmer of hope :3 also it's just plain creepy and reminds me of WoodFall Temple XD  
2016-01-16 00:33:13	Scruffy	I can't decide on a favorite
2016-01-16 00:33:19	Scruffy	They all have so much to like
2016-01-16 00:33:31	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-01-16 00:33:36	Neocraftz1553	yeah, thats true
2016-01-16 00:33:54	StarWolf	Pikmin has amazing music. There's only one game I can think of that tops it.
2016-01-16 00:34:00	Scruffy	Which one?
2016-01-16 00:34:06	StarWolf	Okami
2016-01-16 00:34:08	Neocraftz1553	yeah which one
2016-01-16 00:34:09	Neocraftz1553	oh
2016-01-16 00:34:17	Neocraftz1553	let me search it up
2016-01-16 00:34:27	@PikFan	speaking of Wistful Wild: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W-JdlUB7L4&t=0m56s
2016-01-16 00:34:35	StarWolf	wait, let me send you a link to my fav track
2016-01-16 00:34:38	@PikFan	heh, now Scruffy has a color
