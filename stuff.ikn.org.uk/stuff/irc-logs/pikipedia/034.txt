2016-09-09 13:40:27	@Espyo	were you making each poly an object?
2016-09-09 13:40:53	Yoshi2	no, I made each 4x4 tile an object
2016-09-09 13:41:04	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-09 13:41:04	Yoshi2	which on a map with over 10k tiles is still a lot
2016-09-09 13:41:05	Testyo	10 K = -263.15 °C / -441.67 °F
2016-09-09 13:41:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-09 13:41:16	@Espyo	can't you make each object be like 64x64?
2016-09-09 13:41:24	@Espyo	seems like a good midway point
2016-09-09 13:49:19	Yoshi2	in theory yes, but I will only bother with that if I get any meaningful performance boost from my current attempt to make the entire thing one object
2016-09-09 13:49:27	Yoshi2	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand blender crashed due to access violation
2016-09-09 13:55:19	Yoshi2	well, for the moment I got rid of faces
2016-09-09 13:57:14	Yoshi2	I am quite happy with this: https://i.imgur.com/VnP14ei.png
2016-09-09 14:02:21	Yoshi2	access violation that has nothing to do with how many faces I draw, weiird
2016-09-09 14:02:26	Yoshi2	how do I track that down....
2016-09-09 14:05:39	@Espyo	access violation just sounds like you ran out of ram
2016-09-09 14:08:31	Yoshi2	I wish, but nope
2016-09-09 14:08:46	Yoshi2	it doesn't matter if I draw 50000000 faces or 1
2016-09-09 14:08:52	Yoshi2	and it does work with just the vertices
2016-09-09 14:09:31	@Espyo	hmm
2016-09-09 14:09:38	@Espyo	well, looks like you figured out the problem

2016-09-09 14:10:43	Yoshi2	it worked before with the faces being separate, so I wonder what is wrong
2016-09-09 14:50:13	Yoshi2	i
2016-09-09 14:50:15	Yoshi2	see
2016-09-09 14:50:33	Yoshi2	the issue was that I had a negative integer as an edge index

2016-09-09 14:58:42	@Espyo	welp

2016-09-09 14:58:57	@Espyo	oh, definitely
2016-09-09 14:58:59	Yoshi2	gaps are still there but I realized why
2016-09-09 14:59:02	@Espyo	how's performance?
2016-09-09 14:59:07	Yoshi2	performance is great
2016-09-09 14:59:16	@Espyo	great
2016-09-09 15:00:11	Yoshi2	so basically, the tiles are supposed to overlap
2016-09-09 15:01:13	@Espyo	uhm, how come?
2016-09-09 15:04:31	Yoshi2	or not overlap, but touch at the edges

2016-09-09 15:07:28	CraftedPbody	On a different topic, should there be a rule for advertisements?
2016-09-09 15:07:51	CraftedPbody	Someone posted an ad and it looks pretty darn shady.
2016-09-09 15:08:04	@Espyo	we don't, but I guess it's the usual
2016-09-09 15:08:12	@Espyo	it should be related to the series
2016-09-09 15:08:25	CraftedPbody	to add to it, it's the only post this person has
2016-09-09 15:08:25	@Espyo	it shouldn't so much be an ad as much as sharing something cool, even if self-made

2016-09-09 15:10:38	@Espyo	it's not even the product's name, it's just a vague description? check
2016-09-09 15:10:50	@Espyo	an explanation of the product with no context in the message's body?
2016-09-09 15:10:51	@Espyo	check
2016-09-09 15:10:52	CraftedPbody	I figured it was a spambot

2016-09-09 15:11:28	@Espyo	this is like a textbook example of a spambot
2016-09-09 15:11:35	@Espyo	forum spambots are so alike
2016-09-09 15:11:41	@Espyo	which is good, since it makes finding them easier

2016-09-09 15:13:36	@Espyo	and yeah, that kid's kinda weird

2016-09-09 15:21:09	CraftedPbody	oh, I see, so this kid made an account before, but I guess they either forgot or just forgot the password, because they made a second account.

2016-09-09 15:25:54	CraftedPbody	ok
2016-09-09 15:27:50	CraftedPbody	Should we get rid of accounts that are 1 year old with no posts? I ask this because technically, they are taking up usernames that can be used my new people
2016-09-09 15:28:31	@Espyo	really, don't worry about it
2016-09-09 15:28:34	@Espyo	no forum does that
2016-09-09 15:28:41	@Espyo	it's just needless work
2016-09-09 15:29:02	@Espyo	it's rare for people to bump against cases where their usernames are already taken, especially on a forum that's struggling to even reach 1000 people

2016-09-10 14:16:10	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Carrying#Pikmin_3 I want to experiment more with Winged Pikmin's speed. I think I have a few things to try
2016-09-10 14:16:29	Marty2000	Like, are they faster when carrying an object while walking? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Winged_Pikmin#Trivia
2016-09-10 14:16:38	Marty2000	What about their speed when using a spicy spray?
2016-09-10 14:17:10	@Espyo	hehe, yeah, give it a try
2016-09-10 14:22:45	Marty2000	I'll try more, but it seems they're slower even when walking
2016-09-10 14:23:07	Marty2000	I'm using the fragments in the Twilight River to make one walk
2016-09-10 14:23:14	Marty2000	And I'm using a Blue Pikmin for comparison
2016-09-10 14:23:28	Marty2000	And it seems the Blue Pikmin is faster
2016-09-10 14:24:04	@Espyo	right
2016-09-10 14:25:25	Marty2000	Yeah, I think the Blue Pikmin is definitel faster
2016-09-10 14:25:54	Marty2000	It'd be easier to tell with the fragments on the Distant Tundra, but I'm not sure I have a save with the main bridges skipped. So ...
2016-09-10 14:26:02	Marty2000	definitely*
2016-09-10 14:28:54	Marty2000	I tested with flower Pikmin, I'll try with some Pikmin on the leaf stage...
2016-09-10 14:30:02	Marty2000	It's more apparent with leaf Pikmin
2016-09-10 15:16:44	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e7DJU-rA there's so much wrong here
2016-09-10 15:17:46	Marty2000	No glitch, am I right?
2016-09-10 15:19:42	@Espyo	no, no glitch in this one

2016-09-10 15:21:30	@Espyo	really can't tell where that is
2016-09-10 15:28:24	Marty2000	Very likely a cave on the Distant Tundra
2016-09-10 15:29:43	@Espyo	mhm, I have that feeling too
2016-09-10 15:29:55	@Espyo	oh, probably the Yellow Onion cave
2016-09-10 15:30:00	@Espyo	most famous place to go out of bounds
2016-09-10 15:31:21	Marty2000	Yes
2016-09-10 15:37:54	Marty2000	Even with the Spicy Spray, a walking Blue Pikmin is faster at carrying a fragment than a Winged Pikmin... intriguing

2016-09-10 21:18:40	@Espyo	starting to think it'd be easier to ask the dev
2016-09-10 21:20:35	Yoshi2	ok I need sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4.qtopengl
2016-09-10 21:21:32	Yoshi2	ok now I am bac at gx.texture not found, which I need cython for

2016-09-10 21:59:32	Yoshi2	Espyo: https://i.imgur.com/DL7igBE.png I guess it was kinda worth it
2016-09-10 22:01:30	@Espyo	lighting's kinda crap
2016-09-10 22:09:54	Yoshi2	it was crap in bmdview too so it might be an issue with the model
2016-09-10 22:10:38	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-10 22:13:53	Yoshi2	so to sum it up: pyqt4, pyopengl, pyqt4.qtopengl, numpy, cython in terms of dependencies
2016-09-10 22:14:35	Yoshi2	pyqt4, pyqt4.qtopengl have to be installed through apt-get, pyopengl and cython can be installed through pip3 (sudo pip3 might be necessary due to permission stuff)
2016-09-10 22:15:31	Yoshi2	numpy is kinda weird, I installed it through pip3 and the import worked but the pyx file referenced a numpy header file which it couldn't find
2016-09-10 22:15:45	Yoshi2	installing numpy through apt-get made it work
2016-09-10 22:16:07	Yoshi2	python3-pyqt4, python3-pyqt.qtopengl, python3-numpy
2016-09-10 22:16:43	Yoshi2	plus the j3dview.py file needs to be modified (add "import pyximport" and "pyximport.install()" at the top)
2016-09-10 22:18:53	Yoshi2	I think that concludes my discovery and if you get pip3 to work you should be able to install it and get it running
2016-09-10 22:20:32	@Espyo	sheesh
2016-09-10 22:20:45	@Espyo	thanks, though
2016-09-10 22:20:47	@Espyo	I'll point it down
2016-09-10 22:20:51	@Espyo	and try it when I can get pip3 to work
2016-09-10 22:38:05	Yoshi2	the main pro of j3dview is that it's in python, which means I could attempt to fix it up a bit to an extent if necessary

2016-09-11 13:23:39	Yoshi2	completely unnecessary in most cases
2016-09-11 13:24:11	@Espyo	heh, yep
2016-09-11 13:29:36	Yoshi2	just let me throw the program somewhere and run it directly

2016-09-11 17:33:03	Marty2000	LOL
2016-09-11 17:33:12	@Espyo	not long enough
2016-09-11 17:33:21	Marty2000	I love how it starts in a chaotic way and then, it gets so... calm
2016-09-11 17:35:23	Yoshi2	I've got to admit, I did not get the point of the song until the chaos came to an end
2016-09-11 17:38:55	Yoshi2	and then I laughed out loud because I am a bad person
2016-09-11 17:40:30	@Espyo	wait, is the end a reference to something specific?
2016-09-11 17:40:44	Marty2000	Laughed for the chaos and calm
2016-09-11 17:41:05	@Espyo	sounds like a boss villain theme

2016-09-11 17:41:19	Yoshi2	Espyo: look at it from a geometric perspective
2016-09-11 17:41:32	Yoshi2	two long rectangles
2016-09-11 17:42:01	@Espyo	...nope
2016-09-11 17:42:06	Yoshi2	moving downwards
2016-09-11 17:42:22	Marty2000	Ah!

2016-09-11 22:15:08	Yoshi2	having two regular rips with "Tower" in the title, fine
2016-09-11 22:15:28	Yoshi2	a rip about the "Terrifying 911" bootleg gameboy game, sure
2016-09-11 22:15:43	Yoshi2	but not 4 videos with essentially the same joke at the end
2016-09-11 22:19:32	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-11 22:21:45	Yoshi2	checking the gilvasunner subreddit, it appears people are more upset about the bean rips than the 9/11 rips (with 9/11 rips being "just" tasteless)

2016-09-12 19:32:30	@Espyo	hmm
2016-09-12 19:32:36	@Espyo	I remember in college learning there are a lot of usual ways
2016-09-12 19:32:48	@Espyo	so it's not just the "face X uses vertexes Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4"
2016-09-12 19:32:53	@Espyo	they had some really janky methods
2016-09-12 19:33:30	Yoshi2	if you can find a reference to those usual ways, that would be great
2016-09-12 19:34:52	@Espyo	sorry, only from memory
2016-09-12 19:34:55	@Espyo	but
2016-09-12 19:34:57	@Espyo	google might have some
2016-09-12 19:35:15	Yoshi2	:-|
2016-09-12 19:35:41	Yoshi2	not even any specific terms for what that is called?
2016-09-12 19:35:54	@Espyo	sorry...
2016-09-12 19:36:01	@Espyo	it's really useful, too, but I have no way
2016-09-12 19:36:07	@Espyo	uhm, I wonder if I can access Moodle
2016-09-12 19:36:12	@Espyo	and maybe, just maybe, they'll have docs
2016-09-12 19:38:04	@Espyo	great, I'm locked out of everything since I'm not a student
2016-09-12 19:38:37	Yoshi2	aw
2016-09-12 19:38:43	@Espyo	gah, and I did save a zip file of documents and such
2016-09-12 19:38:45	@Espyo	but it's not there
2016-09-12 19:38:58	@Espyo	I was never the kind of guy to pay attention to theoretical lessons, much less save their slideshows
2016-09-12 19:39:30	@Espyo	I'll ask a friend
2016-09-12 19:39:47	Yoshi2	alrighty, thanks

2016-09-12 19:40:10	Yoshi2	any info you can uncover will be helpful
2016-09-12 19:40:56	Yoshi2	until then, I will be poking away at this format which is tedious and mind numbing and makes me want to die
2016-09-12 19:41:59	@Espyo	I bet
2016-09-12 19:43:37	@Espyo	all right, he says he'll search for them when he gets home

2016-09-13 19:16:45	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-13 19:16:47	@Espyo	neat
2016-09-13 19:17:13	Yoshi2	also
2016-09-13 19:17:17	Yoshi2	I think I found out a very
2016-09-13 19:17:18	Yoshi2	very
2016-09-13 19:17:23	Yoshi2	scary thing about the format
2016-09-13 19:18:22	@Espyo	oh?
2016-09-13 19:18:42	Yoshi2	I think to describe the edges it uses GC GPU commands
2016-09-13 19:18:57	@Espyo	uhh...
2016-09-13 19:20:42	Yoshi2	well, not entirely sure about that, but what I saw fits the info here: http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yagcd/yagcd/chap5.html#sec5.11.5
2016-09-13 19:20:48	Yoshi2	GP packet description
2016-09-13 19:20:55	Yoshi2	the heck is a GP packet
2016-09-13 19:21:46	@Espyo	no idea
2016-09-13 19:21:51	@Espyo	I think I'm missing something here
2016-09-13 19:21:53	@Espyo	like
2016-09-13 19:21:57	@Espyo	by edges
2016-09-13 19:22:01	@Espyo	do you mean edges of triangles?
2016-09-13 19:22:22	Yoshi2	yes
2016-09-13 19:22:35	@Espyo	so, you're saying that the file doesn't have any edge data
2016-09-13 19:22:43	@Espyo	instead, edges come from, well, connecting vertexes
2016-09-13 19:23:10	Yoshi2	it connects 3 vertices at a time using TRIANGLESTRIP
2016-09-13 19:23:27	@Espyo	right
2016-09-13 19:23:38	@Espyo	does it ONLY use TRIANGLESTRIP?
2016-09-13 19:24:14	Yoshi2	it also loads the CP and XF registers sometimes, but for the most part it's only trianglestrip
2016-09-13 19:24:29	@Espyo	how can you tell?
2016-09-13 19:25:23	Yoshi2	by the existence of 0x8 and 0x10 opcodes, and then comes a 0x98 opcode, which has 2 bytes describing the amount of vertices
2016-09-13 19:25:47	@Espyo	aaahh
2016-09-13 19:25:54	@Espyo	so the model data actually has opcodes in it
2016-09-13 19:25:55	@Espyo	that's insane!
2016-09-13 19:25:58	Yoshi2	then comes 3*vertices bytes (for more complex models seems to be 6*vertcies bytes) and then the data ends
2016-09-13 19:26:25	@Espyo	how did you even find this out?
2016-09-13 19:26:27	Yoshi2	it would explain why I had opcode errors when messing around with the data
2016-09-13 19:27:07	Yoshi2	here is how I found it out
2016-09-13 19:28:08	Yoshi2	1) find the smallest possible piece of data that describes the edges/triangles
2016-09-13 19:28:32	Yoshi2	2) realize that from one such thing you can't find anything so you collect more examples
2016-09-13 19:28:48	Yoshi2	3) realize there is a common pattern at the start: Hooray you figured out the header!
2016-09-13 19:29:10	Yoshi2	4) hit your head on the table many times because that still only accounts for what, 16 bytes of many more
2016-09-13 19:29:57	Yoshi2	5) remember the opcode errors you had from messing around with the data and have a thought about what if this is actually GC-specific data
2016-09-13 19:30:45	Yoshi2	6) check GC docs and find out that some of the info fits what you see in the data
2016-09-13 19:31:12	Yoshi2	7) do more testing and find out that the devs ARE insane enough to use opcodes to describe the triangles
2016-09-13 19:31:21	Yoshi2	ok that's enough steps i think
2016-09-13 19:31:34	@Espyo	amazing
2016-09-13 19:31:47	@Espyo	what about more complex models? do those work ok with this method?
2016-09-13 19:31:54	Yoshi2	hehe no
2016-09-13 19:31:58	Yoshi2	of course not
2016-09-13 19:32:01	Yoshi2	not without adjustments
2016-09-13 19:32:16	@Espyo	there's still more to it, eh?
2016-09-13 19:32:35	Yoshi2	there is more to it even with the regular models
2016-09-13 19:33:02	Yoshi2	because of missing faces, or messed up faces, or vertex indices that are out of bounds for my vertex list
2016-09-13 19:33:48	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-13 19:34:03	@Espyo	but damn, this opcode thing is promising
2016-09-13 19:34:16	@Espyo	can't believe they actually did it, the madmen
2016-09-13 19:34:33	Yoshi2	potentially, you could do weird stuff with it
2016-09-13 19:34:44	Yoshi2	IF there was some actual documentation to this
2016-09-13 19:35:22	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-13 19:37:21	Yoshi2	not sure what the vertex data for trianglestrip looks like
2016-09-13 19:38:50	Yoshi2	probably similar to the other ones
2016-09-13 19:39:06	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-13 19:39:11	@Espyo	so you're not familiar with these drawing methods, eh?
2016-09-13 19:39:27	@Espyo	these aren't GameCube specific
2016-09-13 19:39:33	@Espyo	OpenGL has them, DirectX has them, ...
2016-09-13 19:40:10	 *	Yoshi2 has 0 knowledge with 3d
2016-09-13 19:40:25	@Espyo	hehe, right
2016-09-13 19:40:32	@Espyo	so, these are actually pretty simple
2016-09-13 19:40:49	@Espyo	vertexes A, B, C, D, E
2016-09-13 19:40:50	Yoshi2	as far as I understand, trianglestrip is like make v1,v2,v3 a triangle, v2,v3,v4 a triangle, v3,v4,v5... etc
2016-09-13 19:40:59	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-13 19:41:10	@Espyo	triangle fan has v1 be the central point
2016-09-13 19:41:16	@Espyo	and then you just create a fan around it
2016-09-13 19:41:27	@Espyo	triangles is every 3 vertexes is a triangle
2016-09-13 19:41:28	Yoshi2	what is a fan
2016-09-13 19:41:32	@Espyo	like a paper fan
2016-09-13 19:42:00	Yoshi2	how can v1 be the central point in a triangle
2016-09-13 19:42:11	@Espyo	no, it's the central point in a lot of triangles
2016-09-13 19:42:15	@Espyo	this is a lot easier with diagrams
2016-09-13 19:42:24	Yoshi2	doesn't v1 have to be one of the corners of the triangle?
2016-09-13 19:42:29	@Espyo	https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC56472.gif
2016-09-13 19:42:35	@Espyo	simple as that, really :P
2016-09-13 19:43:02	Yoshi2	oh
2016-09-13 19:43:41	Yoshi2	now, there is 3 bytes of data per vertex in this trianglestrip call
2016-09-13 19:44:12	Yoshi2	one of them probably references the vertex (although that doesn't always work out, due to exceeding the amount of vertices you have)
2016-09-13 19:44:20	Yoshi2	and I have no idea what the others do
2016-09-13 19:44:25	@Espyo	one byte for the vertex id? really?
2016-09-13 19:44:30	@Espyo	that'd limit you to 255 vertexes
2016-09-13 19:44:53	Yoshi2	low-poly model
2016-09-13 19:45:05	Yoshi2	the hedgehog has less than 100 vertices I think
2016-09-13 19:45:08	@Espyo	...VERY low-poly, then
2016-09-13 19:45:15	@Espyo	are all models 255- vertexes?
2016-09-13 19:45:21	Yoshi2	no
2016-09-13 19:45:34	@Espyo	oh, so some will have to be 2-bytes for the vertex id, right?
2016-09-13 19:45:37	Yoshi2	this is where the concept of "more complex models" comes in
2016-09-13 19:45:50	Yoshi2	the more complex models use 2 bytes, yes
2016-09-13 19:46:48	@Espyo	so what, does the model just have data at the start that says "I'm simple" or "I'm complex"?
2016-09-13 19:46:56	@Espyo	and that determines the size of ids, in bytes?
2016-09-13 19:47:04	 *	Yoshi2 has no idea
2016-09-13 19:47:18	@Espyo	then how do you know it's one byte, or two bytes?
2016-09-13 19:47:27	Yoshi2	i will figure it out
2016-09-13 19:47:37	Yoshi2	later
2016-09-13 19:47:43	Yoshi2	when the more simple models are working
2016-09-13 19:47:44	@Espyo	in other words, how do you know some models use 1, and some use 2?
2016-09-13 19:48:08	Yoshi2	pls stop I don't care about the more complex ones /o\
2016-09-13 19:48:12	Yoshi2	(yet)
2016-09-13 19:48:16	@Espyo	but it's necessary :/
2016-09-13 19:48:22	@Espyo	what if
2016-09-13 19:48:24	Yoshi2	at the moment, only working with the simple ones
2016-09-13 19:48:31	@Espyo	it's three bytes to represent an id? regardless of model size
2016-09-13 19:48:47	@Espyo	what if endianness is in the way?
2016-09-13 19:49:01	Yoshi2	it's not three bytes to represent an id, I can say that for sure
2016-09-13 19:49:06	@Espyo	well, all right
2016-09-13 19:49:13	@Espyo	well, what if
2016-09-13 19:49:15	Yoshi2	also, before the vertex data comes some writing to registers
2016-09-13 19:49:25	Yoshi2	maybe that signals "I am a complex model"
2016-09-13 19:49:30	@Espyo	that's scary
2016-09-13 19:49:34	Yoshi2	it is
2016-09-13 19:49:50	@Espyo	ok, back to triangle strip, I guess
2016-09-13 19:49:55	@Espyo	 3 bytes of data per vertex...
2016-09-13 19:49:57	@Espyo	what if
2016-09-13 19:50:01	Yoshi2	for the more simple model, : 00 00 00 01 00 01 02 00 02  as an example describes the triangle made of 3 vertices 0, 1 and 2
2016-09-13 19:50:24	@Espyo	 2 bytes serve as the vertex id, and the final byte is 0 for a normal vertex, 1 if you're meant to "restart" the strip?
2016-09-13 19:50:58	@Espyo	hm, I see
2016-09-13 19:51:03	@Espyo	so bytes 0 and 2 are mirrored, huh?
2016-09-13 19:51:13	Yoshi2	not always
2016-09-13 19:51:26	Yoshi2	in that simple example yes, but there are others where they aren't
2016-09-13 19:51:56	@Espyo	if you all of the 3rd bytes to 0, what will happen?
2016-09-13 19:52:04	@Espyo	I mean, do let me know if I'm standing on your toes, here
2016-09-13 19:52:12	@Espyo	I'm probably not suggesting anything you wouldn't think of yourself
2016-09-13 19:52:31	@Espyo	I can give some tips on how the drawing methods work, since I draw polygons with Allegro (OpenGL, really) a couple of times, and use those types of operations
2016-09-13 19:52:41	@Espyo	but everything else about the reverse-engineering part is up to you
2016-09-13 19:54:06	Yoshi2	I haven't tested that yet, though I have tried setting the first bytes to 0 (it made the triangle disappear)
2016-09-13 19:54:31	Yoshi2	the idea with the restart strip is a nice one, I will have to check for that
2016-09-13 19:54:32	@Espyo	well that's reassuring
2016-09-13 19:54:51	@Espyo	honestly, it could be anything; this format is already janky as-is
2016-09-13 19:55:18	Yoshi2	all I can think of is why isn't there better docs for this
2016-09-13 19:55:25	Yoshi2	dolphin is already supposed to be able to do it
2016-09-13 19:55:36	@Espyo	yeah, definitely

2016-09-13 22:12:21	Yoshi2	there is some decent documentation, but i'd need to read through it all to find what I need
2016-09-13 22:13:12	Yoshi2	Espyo: would you be willing to do that, it's only a bit over 5 thousand lines of text to read https://github.com/devkitPro/libogc/blob/master/gc/ogc/gx.h
2016-09-13 22:14:37	@Espyo	ctrl+f?
2016-09-13 22:17:00	Yoshi2	there are many results for "vertex", and if I narrow it down too much I risk not finding what I need
2016-09-13 22:18:19	@Espyo	what exactly are you looking for?
2016-09-13 22:20:56	Yoshi2	what info the user can/has to specify when drawing a triangle
2016-09-13 22:21:13	@Espyo	got it
2016-09-13 22:23:06	@Espyo	doesn't look like there's anything
2016-09-13 22:23:30	Yoshi2	I do see some interesting stuff, but not quite what fits here
2016-09-13 22:24:34	@Espyo	since I tried searching the entire project for GX_TRIANGLEFAN
2016-09-13 22:24:35	@Espyo	and there's only one result, on that .h
2016-09-13 22:24:35	@Espyo	which says nothing
2016-09-13 22:24:35	@Espyo	so, there isn't even the implementation
2016-09-13 22:24:35	@Espyo	I also tried searching for 0xA0, but still nothing
2016-09-13 22:24:35	@Espyo	wherever the implementation is, it's not here
2016-09-13 22:24:35	Testyo	Espyo is a flooder!
2016-09-13 22:24:44	@Espyo	wtf Testyo
2016-09-13 22:24:45	Testyo	I don't have a PS4, or maybe rainbow pikmin that would be cool
2016-09-13 22:25:49	Yoshi2	yup, I feared that much
2016-09-13 22:26:03	Yoshi2	one thing I found is this struct of what I guess is a vertex: 
2016-09-13 22:26:04	Yoshi2		f32 x,y,z;
2016-09-13 22:26:05	Yoshi2		u16 s,t;
2016-09-13 22:26:05	Yoshi2		u32 rgba;
2016-09-13 22:26:07	@Espyo	but either way, whatever documentation we get will likely not tell us what the 3 bytes mean
2016-09-13 22:26:24	Yoshi2	x y z are coordinates, rgba are the color, but the heck is s and t
2016-09-13 22:26:30	@Espyo	texture coordinates
2016-09-13 22:26:46	Yoshi2	oh
2016-09-13 22:27:04	@Espyo	like, imagine you want to draw a square with a texture
2016-09-13 22:27:04	@Espyo	the vertex at the top right has whatever coordinates
2016-09-13 22:27:09	@Espyo	plus the texture coordinates 0, 0
2016-09-13 22:27:26	@Espyo	*top left
2016-09-13 22:27:26	@Espyo	the vertex on the top right would have, say, 256, 0
2016-09-13 22:27:30	@Espyo	(a 256x256 texture, for instance)
2016-09-13 22:27:30	@Espyo	etc.
2016-09-13 22:28:29	@Espyo	the code to draw primitives likely wants vertex coordinates and that's it
2016-09-13 22:28:40	@Espyo	and we know that on the BW files, those calls have the vertex ID
2016-09-13 22:28:43	@Espyo	so already it's not a perfect match
2016-09-13 22:28:51	@Espyo	meaning that honestly, the calls could be anything
2016-09-13 22:28:58	Yoshi2	ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-09-13 22:29:25	@Espyo	<vertex ID>, <slightly shift this vertex horizontally randomly?>, <slightly shift this vertex vertically randomly?>
2016-09-13 22:29:27	@Espyo	who the hell knows
2016-09-13 22:31:47	Yoshi2	there is ONE thing I could imagine being there
2016-09-13 22:32:01	Yoshi2	and that's whether the triangle is supposed to face upwards or downwards or whatever
2016-09-13 22:32:08	@Espyo	oh, the normal?
2016-09-13 22:32:11	@Espyo	eeeeeehhh...
2016-09-13 22:32:14	@Espyo	I doubt it
2016-09-13 22:32:25	@Espyo	since that data would be on the face, really
2016-09-13 22:32:28	@Espyo	not on the vertex
2016-09-13 22:32:32	@Espyo	there ARE vertex normals
2016-09-13 22:32:39	@Espyo	but wouldn't those be on the vertex info? alongside their coordinates
2016-09-13 22:32:57	@Espyo	well, what can you tell of patterns in those bytes?
2016-09-13 22:33:01	@Espyo	is the second byte ALWAYS zero?
2016-09-13 22:33:07	Yoshi2	not always
2016-09-13 22:33:24	@Espyo	what if you try changing all of them to 0?
2016-09-13 22:33:34	Yoshi2	one thing I can tell is
2016-09-13 22:33:39	Yoshi2	it's a huge pain
2016-09-13 22:33:43	@Espyo	I bet
2016-09-13 22:34:05	Yoshi2	physically exhausting
2016-09-13 22:34:30	Yoshi2	starring at a hex editor, changing a thing, rebuilding the game, checking the changes
2016-09-13 22:34:36	@Espyo	definitely
2016-09-13 22:34:41	@Espyo	but hey, at least you've got leads
2016-09-13 22:34:52	@Espyo	nothing beats doing something like that when you DON'T have anywhere to go
2016-09-13 22:35:12	@Espyo	like trying to fix a bug during the 9th hour, where you've already done everything to your code and nothing shows up
2016-09-13 22:35:19	Yoshi2	requires a lot of concentration
2016-09-13 22:35:19	Yoshi2	It definitely is nice to have leads
2016-09-13 22:35:26	@Espyo	and you're starting to think if rebuilding the entire project from scratch would be faster and easier than hunting it down
2016-09-13 22:37:16	Yoshi2	I will see if I can hire my favorite french guy to do some stuff too (not marty but a different guy who plays the game)
2016-09-13 22:38:46	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-13 22:38:47	@Espyo	hopefully
2016-09-13 22:40:12	Yoshi2	I would steal marty too but I don't feel right with giving people who haven't played the game modding tasks
2016-09-13 22:40:21	Testyo	I don't know, I've found all sorts of ideas on おやすみなさい！
2016-09-13 22:41:15	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-13 22:41:22	@Espyo	don't even know if he knows about modding
2016-09-13 22:43:47	Yoshi2	off to bed now, good night

2016-09-14 19:30:22	Testyo	Greetings everyone!
2016-09-14 19:31:07	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-09-14 19:31:08	Testyo	that is a Dustforce level
2016-09-14 19:37:51	Yoshi2	on my model efforts, I went from https://i.imgur.com/oDeVikQ.png to http://i.imgur.com/r5WgKmJ.png to https://i.imgur.com/gu2aK82.png
2016-09-14 19:37:54	@Espyo	hi
2016-09-14 19:38:14	@Espyo	that is amazing
2016-09-14 19:38:25	@Espyo	is there anything left?
2016-09-14 19:39:45	Yoshi2	yes
2016-09-14 19:39:57	Yoshi2	putting the pieces together because what you see is not the entire thing
2016-09-14 19:40:00	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-14 19:40:58	Yoshi2	remember when I said I modified the first byte and it didn't show?
2016-09-14 19:41:07	Yoshi2	turns out the first byte is the vertex index
2016-09-14 19:41:24	Yoshi2	or in the case of more complex models, the first two bytes
2016-09-14 19:41:30	@Espyo	right
2016-09-14 19:41:39	@Espyo	but that was your original guess, right?
2016-09-14 19:41:44	@Espyo	oh, yeah, it was
2016-09-14 19:41:48	@Espyo	I'm following entirely, now
2016-09-14 19:41:51	@Espyo	ok, but what about the third byte?
2016-09-14 19:42:03	Yoshi2	it's MYSTERIOUS
2016-09-14 19:42:17	Yoshi2	my theory is that the third byte is for the uv map
2016-09-14 19:42:23	Yoshi2	and second byte
2016-09-14 19:42:40	Yoshi2	because when I set it to 0, the triange became solid colored ingame
2016-09-14 19:43:02	@Espyo	<Yoshi2> and second byte
2016-09-14 19:43:04	@Espyo	^?
2016-09-14 19:43:17	Yoshi2	second byte and third byte for the uv map
2016-09-14 19:43:22	Yoshi2	or what did you not understand
2016-09-14 19:43:33	@Espyo	no, you answered it
2016-09-14 19:43:50	@Espyo	oh, so
2016-09-14 19:43:51	Yoshi2	oh, your ? confused me
2016-09-14 19:44:04	@Espyo	yeah, because your "and second byte" confused me lol
2016-09-14 19:44:28	@Espyo	ok, so, does that mean that more complex models use FOUR bytes?
2016-09-14 19:44:37	@Espyo	or does it mean the 2nd byte can be both for the id AND for the uv?

2016-09-14 19:45:35	Yoshi2	simple models have 3 bytes of data per vertex, more complex ones have 6 bytes
2016-09-14 19:45:55	Yoshi2	simple: I U V, complex: II UU VV
2016-09-14 19:47:12	@Espyo	all right, fair enough
2016-09-14 19:47:22	@Espyo	yeah, I guess that makes a lot of sense
2016-09-14 19:49:12	Yoshi2	the first picture is when I drew the triangles as (v1, v2, v3), (v2, v3, v4) etc.
2016-09-14 19:50:41	Yoshi2	but the actual order appears to be (v1, v2, v3) (v2, v4, v3), (v3, v4, v5) etc
2016-09-14 19:51:32	@Espyo	well, it depends on the operation, right?
2016-09-14 19:51:40	Yoshi2	for vertical strip at least
2016-09-14 19:53:41	Yoshi2	(if I do it the first way, the normals in blender are messed up for every second vertex
2016-09-14 19:54:53	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-09-14 19:55:09	Yoshi2	not for me
2016-09-14 19:55:12	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-14 19:55:33	@Espyo	the way OpenGL and the like know which way a triangle is facing is with the order the vertexes are drawn in
2016-09-14 19:55:40	@Espyo	if you have a triangle, simple triangle pointing up
2016-09-14 19:55:47	@Espyo	and you draw up, bottom right, bottom left
2016-09-14 19:55:53	@Espyo	the "front" face is the one facing you
2016-09-14 19:56:06	@Espyo	but if you draw it up, bottom left, bottom right, the "front" face is facing away from you
2016-09-14 19:56:14	@Espyo	(or the other way around, I don't know by heart)

2016-09-14 20:00:52	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-09-14 20:03:05	Yoshi2	the change from pic 2 to pic 3 was that I ignore the triangles which have two same vertices
2016-09-14 20:03:36	Yoshi2	it seems the devs used such fake triangles to jump from one spot to another in the model while maintaining the trianglestrip
2016-09-14 20:04:49	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-09-14 20:04:49	Testyo	he's the type of guy that has a lot of it this way
2016-09-14 20:06:01	@Espyo	hi
2016-09-14 20:06:27	@Espyo	that's insanely hacky
2016-09-14 20:06:34	@Espyo	but probably a good idea
2016-09-14 20:06:44	@Espyo	since you're often recommended to avoid the overhead of having to start and end a drawing operation
2016-09-14 20:06:51	@Espyo	the more vertexes you can spit out in the same call, the better
2016-09-14 20:07:57	Yoshi2	I wonder if it is possible to make these triangles visible ingame
2016-09-14 20:08:37	Yoshi2	they might be mapped to a transparent texture or the GC doesn't draw them at all
2016-09-14 20:08:43	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-14 20:09:00	Yoshi2	which one do you think is more likely?
2016-09-14 20:09:34	Yoshi2	I am not sure how triangles that has two vertices be the same are drawn

2016-09-14 20:17:17	@Espyo	the latter, honestly
2016-09-14 20:17:24	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think they can be drawn
2016-09-14 20:18:00	Yoshi2	awwww
2016-09-14 20:18:10	Yoshi2	would be a neat thing if it was possible
2016-09-14 20:18:34	@Espyo	well, but you can draw them on Blender
2016-09-14 20:22:44	Yoshi2	how do I explain that to tcrf in a way that doesn't make them think that I made it up? :v
2016-09-14 20:25:04	@Espyo	should you?
2016-09-14 20:25:06	@Espyo	it's not really unused
2016-09-14 20:25:10	@Espyo	and I doubt it's a unique trick
2016-09-14 20:25:14	@Espyo	probably a lot of games do that

2016-09-15 20:09:32	@Espyo	Marty2000: dunno if you know, but I put Purples and Whites in story mode
2016-09-15 20:09:37	@Espyo	I found things
2016-09-15 20:10:40	@Espyo	first, on seesaw blocks, Purples weigh 2 Pikmin
2016-09-15 20:10:46	@Espyo	unless you're holding them, in which case they weigh 4
2016-09-15 20:11:00	@Espyo	and for pushing paper bags... they DO count as 10... but the game expects 10 PIKMIN, not 10 STRENGTH
2016-09-15 20:11:06	@Espyo	the numbers did say 10/20
2016-09-15 20:11:08	@Espyo	*10/10
2016-09-15 20:11:10	@Espyo	and 20/10
2016-09-15 20:11:19	@Espyo	and eventually the bag only moved at 28/10
2016-09-15 20:14:19	Yoshi2	progress on model conversion is related to how dead I feel inside
2016-09-15 20:14:32	@Espyo	so, it'll be done when you up and die?

2016-09-16 20:20:21	@Espyo	holy shit
2016-09-16 20:20:52	Yoshi2	I am doing my best to get the few people I'm in contact with to do tampering with the game
2016-09-16 20:24:17	UltraMario	DO YOUR BST
2016-09-16 20:24:18	UltraMario	:p
2016-09-16 20:26:01	Yoshi2	Espyo: the comments seem suprisingly tame, am I missing something
2016-09-16 20:26:27	Yoshi2	besides tabuu being tabuu and pikifan putting a little bit too much faith into somebody just because they have lots of subscribers
2016-09-16 20:26:33	@Espyo	"Dazz said X. And he's pretty much the only person who's not a loser."
2016-09-16 20:26:35	@Espyo	like, fucking
2016-09-16 20:26:42	@Espyo	what, does that make his words undeniable truth?
2016-09-16 20:26:43	@Espyo	the hell
2016-09-16 20:27:00	@Espyo	though
2016-09-16 20:27:07	@Espyo	I guess I was more upset at the comment when I wrote the reply
2016-09-16 20:27:08	@Espyo	not so much now
2016-09-16 20:27:10	@Espyo	huh
2016-09-16 20:27:11	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-09-16 20:27:12	@Espyo	still stupid
2016-09-16 20:27:45	Yoshi2	in fact, popular youtubers might be more inclined to do guesses like that
2016-09-16 20:28:12	Yoshi2	because guesses and interpreting stuff that is not there into something is a way to make things more interesting
2016-09-16 20:28:16	Yoshi2	hell there is "game theory"
2016-09-16 20:28:41	@Espyo	yep
2016-09-16 20:29:06	Yoshi2	an entire channel about talking out your ass (of course using some evidence from games, but still)
2016-09-16 20:30:58	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-16 20:31:02	@Espyo	and giving games to the pope
2016-09-16 20:34:44	Yoshi2	and tcrf allows some speculation because it is more fun to read "This is an old Goomba. It would likely have appeared alongside the classic looking levels." than "This is an old Goomba."

2016-09-17 09:20:37	Marty2000	I think we can say it is a new Pikmin game because there are new enemies
2016-09-17 09:20:52	Marty2000	However, we do not know if it is canon 
2016-09-17 09:23:44	Pikman	ibut it is not Pikmin 4?
2016-09-17 09:24:27	Yoshi2	probably not

2016-09-17 14:37:41	Marty2000	Heh, I see.
2016-09-17 14:37:56	Marty2000	Reminds me of a playlist I watched on Youtube not long ago
2016-09-17 14:38:12	Marty2000	With a compilation of bad Miiverse posts

2016-09-17 14:40:15	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e_FwDVgA I suppose he's talking about the Pikmin not landing while the cutscene's playing, isn't he?
2016-09-17 14:41:20	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e_Exep7Q How did this Bulborb end up here though?
2016-09-17 14:41:30	Marty2000	Normally, he's quite far from this place
2016-09-17 14:41:34	Marty2000	it's*
2016-09-17 14:51:04	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-17 14:51:28	@Espyo	yeah, the classic "Pikmin are floating during the paper bag" cutscene
2016-09-17 14:51:50	@Espyo	uh, I think there is normally a Bulborb there in CT!
2016-09-17 14:54:01	Marty2000	Well then, it's my memory playing tricks on me, then. Thanks :p
2016-09-17 14:54:25	@Espyo	I could be wrong
2016-09-17 14:54:41	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pyroclasmic_Slooch&curid=9307&diff=169069&oldid=169066 can you check this, please?
2016-09-17 14:55:32	Marty2000	I was going to play Pikmin 3, so yep, I'm going to check this
2016-09-17 14:56:16	Marty2000	I think it's true, I remember this happening to me. But I want to verify, I no longer trust my memory.
2016-09-17 14:57:05	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-17 14:57:10	@Espyo	also, this https://tcrf.net/Talk:Pikmin_3
2016-09-17 14:59:18	Marty2000	One of the Pyroclasmic Slooches dropped some spicy spray
2016-09-17 14:59:22	Marty2000	It wasn't the middle one, though
2016-09-17 14:59:38	Marty2000	The furthest one from the entrance to the cave
2016-09-17 14:59:56	Marty2000	Going to retry
2016-09-17 15:00:06	Marty2000	I got the drop of spray on second try, by the way
2016-09-17 15:00:19	@Espyo	wow
2016-09-17 15:00:21	@Espyo	guess that's right then
2016-09-17 15:01:52	@Espyo	but yeah, if you can check here and there if there are roses, that'd be great
2016-09-17 15:01:54	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-09-17 15:02:06	@Espyo	actually, lemme see if any stage has roses by examining the game's files
2016-09-17 15:05:18	Marty2000	Okay. Meanwhile, I'm trying to get the drop of spray again
2016-09-17 15:06:39	Marty2000	Sometimes, some of the Slooches do not drop pellets. It's unrelated to whether they drop spicy spray or not.
2016-09-17 15:06:58	@Espyo	ok, never mind the rose thing
2016-09-17 15:07:04	@Espyo	it's not used in any map
2016-09-17 15:07:12	Marty2000	Okay
2016-09-17 15:07:50	Marty2000	Once again, the one furthest from the entrance dropped some Spicy Spray.
2016-09-17 15:08:06	Marty2000	Looks like it's not the middle Pyroclasmic that drops it, then...
2016-09-17 15:08:22	Marty2000	Do you need a screenshot as a proof or is that enough?
2016-09-17 15:08:52	@Espyo	uhm...

2016-09-17 15:17:34	Marty2000	Well then, anything else you'd like me to verify? 
2016-09-17 15:19:37	@Espyo	don't think so, thanks
2016-09-17 15:19:45	Marty2000	Okay
2016-09-17 15:20:45	Marty2000	I want to retry the walking speed of Winged Pikmin in the Distant Tundra. I have to skip the main bridges for that, but it'll be easier to verify there than in the Twilight River
2016-09-17 15:22:13	@Espyo	good luck
2016-09-17 15:23:52	Marty2000	Thanks. I think I have a save with all of this already done but I can't find it, ugh.

2016-09-17 16:58:28	Marty2000	The Winged Pikmin will carry a fragment as fast as the Red Pikmin...

2016-09-17 17:04:48	Marty2000	Hmm, after experimenting more, I notice that Red Pikmin are still a bit faster than Winged Pikmin, the latter gaining some speed when they change direction

2016-09-17 17:05:04	Marty2000	Odd...
2016-09-17 17:12:02	Marty2000	Espyo: the store demo looks pretty neat, I'm downloading it
2016-09-17 17:12:07	@Espyo	that's so specific
2016-09-17 17:12:08	@Espyo	yeah, so am I
2016-09-17 17:13:09	Marty2000	Do you think it'd be worth adding the differences somewhere on Pikipedia?
2016-09-17 17:13:26	Marty2000	I mean, the differences between what's in the demo and the final version of the area
2016-09-17 17:17:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-17 17:17:56	Marty2000	Okay
2016-09-17 17:23:27	@Espyo	well, enemy spirits don't seem to make a noise
2016-09-17 17:24:48	Yoshi2	I just realized that I am technically famous on darkmyst: http://www.darkmyst.org/?page=channels (scroll down to #ultramariochat)
2016-09-17 17:24:55	Yoshi2	thanks 0_0
2016-09-17 17:25:13	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-09-17 17:27:33	@Espyo	the area's geography seems to be the same to me
2016-09-17 17:27:37	@Espyo	only object locations change
2016-09-17 17:39:03	Yoshi2	"Dear Hello Games, please fucking say something." 2620 upvotes on reddit. RIP no man's sky
2016-09-17 17:50:58	@Espyo	hmm? have they just been silent ever since release?
2016-09-17 17:52:45	Yoshi2	yup, no words from them in a month or so
2016-09-17 17:58:07	@Espyo	amazing haha
2016-09-17 18:02:12	Marty2000	Espyo: indeed, the demo is mostly a mix of the story mode and challenge mode versions of the level, with a few objects added to it
2016-09-17 18:02:34	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-09-17 18:17:50	Marty2000	Espyo: besides images, there's not much interesting stuff... is there?
2016-09-17 18:18:00	@Espyo	don't think so...
2016-09-17 18:18:11	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-09-17 18:18:25	Marty2000	Ah, never mind, misread your answer
2016-09-17 18:19:04	Marty2000	And most of these images were published by websites long ago, heh
2016-09-17 18:21:30	@Espyo	yep
2016-09-17 18:21:43	Marty2000	Ah, I found the junk file, he he
2016-09-17 18:21:45	Marty2000	abc
2016-09-17 18:21:49	Marty2000	No purpose, I guess
2016-09-17 18:21:57	@Espyo	I guess it's junk :V
2016-09-17 18:22:35	Marty2000	Yep :p
2016-09-17 18:24:29	Yoshi2	but have you checked the contents?
2016-09-17 18:24:38	Yoshi2	maybe looks deceive you
2016-09-17 18:24:50	Marty2000	Funny that the demo contains the controls for Luigi's Mansion
2016-09-17 18:25:01	@Espyo	the contents ARE "abc" lol
2016-09-17 18:25:38	Marty2000	Super interesting stuff, isn't it? :p
2016-09-17 18:30:07	Marty2000	Seems like the controls are the same as the final version of Luigi's Mansion too
2016-09-17 18:31:03	@Espyo	oh, that I don't know
2016-09-17 18:31:47	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-09-17 18:31:49	Marty2000	The controls?
2016-09-17 18:32:32	@Espyo	I don't know a thing about Luigi's Mansion
2016-09-17 18:32:53	Marty2000	Same, I just verified the controls in the final game with Strategy Wiki :p
2016-09-17 18:32:56	Marty2000	And compared with this:

2016-09-17 20:35:02	Testyo	Seriously this enough power to make it matter
2016-09-17 20:37:40	Marty2000	Seriously what's happening to you today, Testyo?
2016-09-17 20:37:40	Testyo	S A V A SITUATION WHERE IT WILL HIT
2016-09-17 20:37:56	Marty2000	Okay okay Testyo, pretend I said nothing

2016-09-22 19:54:00	Marty1401	Oops
2016-09-22 19:54:09	Yoshi2	that guy came in earlier today asking for how to add a new glich to the pikmin 3 glitch page and I pointed him to the glitch notes page
2016-09-22 19:54:16	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-22 19:54:18	@Espyo	great!
2016-09-22 19:54:19	Marty1401	I see
2016-09-22 19:54:22	@Espyo	that's the best answer possible, really
2016-09-22 19:55:19	Marty1401	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_3#Hard_to_reproduce
2016-09-22 19:55:27	Marty1401	It is possible for a Pikmin to become uncontrollable; while the exact method is currently unknown, it appears to happen when the Pikmin begins carrying something the moment it gets squashed.[20] If a Pikmin has become uncontrollable due to the aforementioned glitch, it's possible to bring non-Blues into water. They can attack enemies, destroy obstacles and ca
2016-09-22 19:55:37	Marty1401	This is what I had added
2016-09-22 19:58:08	@Espyo	but
2016-09-22 19:58:13	@Espyo	I thought you DID know the method...
2016-09-22 19:58:26	Marty1401	Of course I did, since I discovered it
2016-09-22 19:58:34	Marty1401	... oh, wait, I see what you mean
2016-09-22 19:58:37	Marty1401	Never mind
2016-09-22 19:58:53	Marty1401	Yeah, I forgot to modify this once I knew how to reproduce the glitch
2016-09-22 19:58:57	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-22 19:59:02	@Espyo	I think now is the best time
2016-09-22 19:59:16	Marty1401	I had already discovered the glitch without being able to know why
2016-09-22 19:59:30	Marty1401	and once I discovered how it happened, I totally forgot that I had added it
2016-09-22 19:59:31	Marty1401	Sorry
2016-09-22 19:59:41	Marty1401	Yep, I'll simply correct what Totalytaco put
2016-09-22 20:00:13	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-22 20:06:22	Marty1401	I'm not really sure the explanation is really correct, though...
2016-09-22 20:06:24	Marty1401	explanation = This is most likely because of the Pikmin's change of state when it dies, you wouldn't want two ghosts for one pikmin death, so dead pikmin are invincible while the game uses its coordinates to spawn the ghost, so when you pick it up as it changes state, this, for whatever reason, creates some kind of hybrid, being a working pikmin but not react
2016-09-22 20:08:33	@Espyo	I'll add an explanation later
2016-09-22 20:08:41	@Espyo	I can imagine something very similar happening on the engine
2016-09-22 20:08:45	@Espyo	so I have a good idea of what causes this
2016-09-22 20:08:55	Marty1401	Oh, neat
2016-09-22 20:09:03	Marty1401	Great, thanks!
2016-09-22 20:09:27	Marty1401	Will put "none" for the moment, anyway

2016-09-22 20:14:01	Marty1401	I mean, it shows how to do the glitch with the timing and all, but if that's useless, then no need for it

2016-09-22 20:17:35	@Espyo	it's weird to say "quite okay", but I thought you'd get the idea
2016-09-22 20:18:49	Marty1401	Ah, well sorry. Not it's likely my understanding to blame :p
2016-09-22 20:19:39	@Espyo	and that Brittany empty line glitch is neat
2016-09-22 20:19:48	@Espyo	you can probably add a note on the Yellow Onion skip glitch
2016-09-22 20:20:11	@Espyo	saying that if the player goes back with Alph and Yellow Pikmin, while Brittany is knocked out, the cutscene will play with Brittany's lines, except the first one will be empty
2016-09-22 20:20:14	Marty1401	I have to record the other empty line you can get with Brittany or Charlie too

2016-09-24 16:31:45	Yoshi2	every 5 days
2016-09-24 16:31:54	@Espyo	wow
2016-09-24 16:32:05	Yoshi2	but I'm sure it's different people each time
2016-09-24 16:32:23	@Espyo	and the hostname is always <3 digits>.<3 digits>.<2 letters>.<3 letters>
2016-09-24 16:32:28	@Espyo	and from Mibbit
2016-09-24 16:32:39	@Espyo	is it some sort of bot?
2016-09-24 16:32:43	@Espyo	it doesn't quite feel like it
2016-09-24 16:32:50	@Espyo	and even if it was... why?
2016-09-24 16:33:39	Yoshi2	darkmyst obfuscates the hostname
2016-09-24 16:34:20	Yoshi2	I've seen lots of people with a hostname like that so it's not a bot
2016-09-24 16:34:25	@Espyo	but with the same pattern?
2016-09-24 16:34:27	Yoshi2	and it's mibbit because the webchat is mibbit
2016-09-24 16:34:33	@Espyo	hm
2016-09-24 16:34:43	@Espyo	maybe it's just one person
2016-09-24 16:34:47	@Espyo	keeps trying to talk to us
2016-09-24 16:34:52	@Espyo	but is too socially awkward to do so
2016-09-24 16:34:57	@Espyo	so just starts with a compliment
2016-09-24 16:34:59	@Espyo	then breaks down
2016-09-24 16:35:00	@Espyo	leaves
2016-09-24 16:35:04	@Espyo	and tries again after some days
2016-09-24 16:35:41	Yoshi2	are you implying the wiki is so crap that only one person would want to compliment it
2016-09-24 16:36:22	@Espyo	correction: the only person who would want to compliment it doesn't even have basic human interaction skills
2016-09-24 16:38:04	Yoshi2	that
2016-09-24 16:38:09	Yoshi2	kinda makes it worse
2016-09-24 16:38:20	Yoshi2	Well, close up shop
2016-09-24 16:38:25	Yoshi2	looks like we failed
2016-09-24 16:38:29	Yoshi2	wikia is better after all
2016-09-24 16:41:09	@Espyo	it was a nice try
2016-09-24 16:41:11	@Espyo	but we're horrible

2016-09-24 16:58:48	@Espyo	oh, different patterned hostname there
2016-09-24 16:58:48	@J	oh, Yoshi already got it
2016-09-24 16:58:52	@J	ages ago
2016-09-24 17:03:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: that was the first hostname in my log paste
2016-09-24 17:03:28	@Espyo	must've skimmed over that...

2016-09-24 18:21:16	Marty2000	Espyo: sorry for not noticing earlier, I was busy
2016-09-24 18:21:23	Marty2000	I don't think it is a glitch
2016-09-24 18:21:34	Marty2000	Wait, on second thought...
2016-09-24 18:21:47	Marty2000	I didn't that the bridge wasn't built
2016-09-24 18:22:00	Marty2000	Hmmm... odd, indeed
2016-09-24 18:22:31	Marty2000	If the bridge had been built, then it could have made sense that the piece of watermelon got there
2016-09-24 18:22:44	Marty2000	And yet... there's no bridge
2016-09-24 18:23:25	@Espyo	yeah, I'm pretty confused
2016-09-24 18:33:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/52sye3/livestreamer_help_please_help/ looks like I wasn't imagining things and everybody is having these issues
2016-09-24 18:34:21	@Espyo	aah
2016-09-24 18:34:27	@Espyo	well, at least it looks like there's a solution

2016-09-24 19:00:34	Yoshi2	so frustrating, livestreamer doesn't work as well as it used to
2016-09-24 19:00:41	Yoshi2	the video stream lags
2016-09-24 19:01:12	@Espyo	ugh
2016-09-24 19:03:05	Yoshi2	or I wish it lagged
2016-09-24 19:03:12	Yoshi2	but I'm not getting any video at all
2016-09-24 19:13:45	Yoshi2	hmmmmm maybe it's an issue with the streamer, getting heavy lag in the browser too
2016-09-24 19:17:50	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-24 19:38:29	@J	oh, that, yeah
2016-09-24 19:39:05	@J	I found a github issue where someone posted the token used by the twitch web player when you're not logged in
2016-09-24 19:39:10	@J	so I just used that, worked fine
2016-09-24 19:39:44	@J	I also normally have it stream to disk rather than open in a player, so I can skip bits, not miss anything if the player goes weird, etc.

2016-09-24 19:44:32	Yoshi2	i do not have lots of free space on my ssd
2016-09-24 19:46:50	UltraMario	i wonder why
2016-09-24 19:46:57	UltraMario	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2016-09-24 20:10:05	@J	I don't think I've ever actually used a computer with an SSD
2016-09-24 20:10:28	Yoshi2	UltraMario: you know why ;) (because of nekopara taking up 3 gigs)
2016-09-24 20:11:45	Yoshi2	well, and a bunch of other things
2016-09-24 20:12:41	Yoshi2	I actually do wonder where all my free space went
2016-09-24 20:13:01	Yoshi2	my games folder is 16 gb, my user folder is 23 gb
2016-09-24 20:14:03	Yoshi2	around 20 gb of programs
2016-09-24 20:15:43	Yoshi2	that still leaves over half of my ssd unaccounted for
2016-09-24 20:15:52	Yoshi2	unless windows is being a fat piece of junk
2016-09-24 20:16:07	@Espyo	check how big the windows folder is
2016-09-24 20:16:43	Yoshi2	30 gb, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-09-24 21:04:27	Yoshi2	6 gb go towards page file and another thing

2016-09-26 19:32:51	@Espyo	hi
2016-09-26 19:33:36	Yoshi2	earlier today i received word that pikipedia got a call out by pbg https://youtu.be/9dDej26FGiY?t=32s
2016-09-26 19:34:14	@Espyo	ooh!
2016-09-26 19:34:36	@Espyo	heh, nice
2016-09-26 19:34:56	@Espyo	though, really, they had to look up if Reds are stronger?
2016-09-26 19:35:04	@Espyo	that's basic .-.
2016-09-26 19:35:45	@Espyo	hah, one of the Pikipedia guys logged in on the youtube account and posted a comment
2016-09-26 19:35:49	@Espyo	"Sorry, we already exist~"
2016-09-26 19:36:42	Marty2000	I guess we went through much harder stuff, which explains that we forget some people do not instantaneously know the basics :p
2016-09-26 19:36:44	Marty2000	Oh, heh
2016-09-26 19:37:50	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-09-26 19:38:10	@Espyo	though, if they know so little...
2016-09-26 19:38:15	@Espyo	it's pretty amazing they went to Pikipedia
2016-09-26 19:38:27	@Espyo	normally, people who don't know anything about the game just google it
2016-09-26 19:38:34	@Espyo	...and we all know what goggling results in...

2016-09-30 19:20:51	@Espyo	hmm
2016-09-30 19:20:53	@Espyo	I think the first
2016-09-30 19:20:56	@Espyo	second one is too plain
2016-09-30 19:21:27	Yoshi2	Espyo: *ignoring the video part
2016-09-30 19:21:47	@Espyo	I didn't see video
2016-09-30 19:21:55	@Espyo	I opened them in a new tab and listened to them while doing other stuff
2016-09-30 19:22:49	Yoshi2	oh
2016-09-30 19:25:10	Yoshi2	a bit odd that you find the second one too plain, the main difference is volume adjustment
2016-09-30 19:25:49	Yoshi2	maybe the instrumental part became a tad quieter
2016-09-30 19:26:24	@Espyo	*shrug* that's the idea I got, at least
2016-09-30 19:27:36	Yoshi2	basically, I spent the time today making my own remix version because I found two separate videos with one video having miku+rap and the other having miku+orchestral music
2016-09-30 19:28:16	Yoshi2	so I overlayed them and changed amplitude because I found the original to be rather loud
2016-09-30 19:30:14	Yoshi2	currently my version is unlisted because I'm fishing for feedback, and I think it is useful to know that you found mine to be plain
2016-09-30 19:32:09	@Espyo	well, plainER
2016-09-30 19:32:11	@Espyo	in comparison to #1
2016-09-30 19:33:27	Yoshi2	I assume due to the orchestral part being quieter
2016-09-30 19:35:01	@Espyo	more or less that, yeah
2016-09-30 19:35:05	@Espyo	during the chorus, it sounds too much like the original
2016-09-30 19:35:18	@Espyo	not like I know the original by heart, but come ON, it's impossible not to know leekspin on the internet
2016-09-30 19:39:46	Yoshi2	that would be a side effect of the orchestral part being too quiet because the rap is silent at some points
2016-09-30 19:42:19	@Espyo	right

2016-10-01 12:24:42	Testyo	...meaning that file is unused and I didn't stick it like, a real series or some random YT series that someone made
2016-10-01 12:24:54	@Espyo	hi
2016-10-01 12:24:59	@Espyo	I'm gonna update the front page now
2016-10-01 12:25:02	@Espyo	but before I do that
2016-10-01 12:25:08	Marty2000	Okay
2016-10-01 12:25:09	@Espyo	I realized we should probably have a Pikmin 3DS poll
2016-10-01 12:25:18	@Espyo	if we want one for Pikmin 3DS, now's our chance
2016-10-01 12:25:18	Marty2000	Good idea
2016-10-01 12:25:30	@Espyo	the most obvious one is "how excited are you for the game"
2016-10-01 12:25:38	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-10-01 12:25:41	@Espyo	but... would it really make sense to give a bunch of whiny brats an opinion?
2016-10-01 12:25:49	@Espyo	we know that most people who are okay with the game don't really care
2016-10-01 12:26:00	@Espyo	but most people who think this is going to ruin the franchise are loud and obnoxious
2016-10-01 12:26:09	@Espyo	I don't think I want to see a poll with 90% "no, it's the worst idea ever!!!11" votes
2016-10-01 12:26:36	Marty2000	Yeah, there could be something like "what's your favourite new idea in Pikmin 3DS", it's likely to be better
2016-10-01 12:26:39	Marty2000	Same, he he
2016-10-01 12:26:44	@Espyo	ooooh, that's good
2016-10-01 12:27:33	Marty2000	And the answers could be "2D Game" "On a 3DS"...
2016-10-01 12:27:39	Marty2000	"Treasures being back"
2016-10-01 12:27:42	Marty2000	Well, you see the idea
2016-10-01 12:28:04	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-01 12:34:41	@Espyo	ok, while I change up the featured article, do you think you can come up with some option ideas for the poll?
2016-10-01 12:34:52	@Espyo	I asked the guys on Discord, but they're either all asleep or too shy to get involved...
2016-10-01 12:37:04	Marty2000	Yeah, sure
2016-10-01 12:47:49	Marty2000	http://pastebin.com/raw/5GFyKise Not sure it's good. I hesitated to combine certain options into one that I would've called "new mechanics, such as..."
2016-10-01 12:48:26	@Espyo	hmm
2016-10-01 12:48:57	@Espyo	hm, I think we might be able to simplify it
2016-10-01 12:49:04	@Espyo	for one thing, the use of the stylus, for instance, isn't really an idea...
2016-10-01 12:49:08	@Espyo	I mean, Pikmin 3 and Nintendo Land did it
2016-10-01 12:49:14	@Espyo	it's almost normal at this point
2016-10-01 12:49:25	Marty2000	Good point
2016-10-01 12:49:31	@Espyo	maybe just focus on the new mechanics and ideas?
2016-10-01 12:49:35	@Espyo	there's a small handful of them
2016-10-01 12:50:02	Marty2000	Not even the use of two screens isn't really new either, as Pikmin 3 did it too
2016-10-01 12:50:18	@Espyo	yeah :P
2016-10-01 12:52:16	@Espyo	though if we simplify it, there isn't much to it
2016-10-01 12:52:16	@Espyo	sidescrolling, or handheld
2016-10-01 12:52:21	@Espyo	new enemies is something present in all games, I guess
2016-10-01 12:52:28	@Espyo	and slightly new mechanics, like Reds stomping on fire
2016-10-01 12:54:35	Marty2000	http://pastebin.com/raw/bZhqU3Ys
2016-10-01 12:54:46	Marty2000	(remove "the new enemies" if you want to)
2016-10-01 12:55:13	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-10-01 12:56:12	@Espyo	I don't know...
2016-10-01 12:56:21	@Espyo	treasures returning is so much of a stretch
2016-10-01 12:57:28	Marty2000	Well, we can still remove it
2016-10-01 12:57:35	Marty2000	Do you think 4 options would be enough?
2016-10-01 12:57:54	@Espyo	yeah, even 3 options would do
2016-10-01 12:57:59	@Espyo	but I fear it'd make the poll really boring...
2016-10-01 12:58:53	Marty2000	Hmmm, or we can totally change what the poll will be about too
2016-10-01 12:58:58	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-01 12:59:04	Marty2000	Trying to think of a new idea
2016-10-01 12:59:08	@Espyo	I'm still on the fence about having a poll of people's general ideas
2016-10-01 12:59:16	Marty2000	(Related to P3DS)
2016-10-01 12:59:21	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-10-01 12:59:25	@Espyo	though, if the final poll we have is sidescrolling, handheld, new mechanics, and new enemies, I don't think it'll be that bad
2016-10-01 13:02:26	@Espyo	Cameron likes that idea, of the four options I said just now ^
2016-10-01 13:02:32	@Espyo	(Leretz)
2016-10-01 13:03:01	Marty2000	Ah, cool
2016-10-01 13:03:54	@Espyo	ok, we'll go with that poll
2016-10-01 13:04:15	Marty2000	Okay!
2016-10-01 13:17:24	@Espyo	phoo, done
2016-10-01 13:17:35	@Espyo	most people continue with the game after a Pikmin dies, but feel sad about it
2016-10-01 13:17:39	@Espyo	that's a vast majority
2016-10-01 13:26:07	Marty2000	I see

2016-10-01 14:50:40	Marty2000	Hey Espyo, I have just tested some stuff with Sonic Heroes, and I found something quite interesting (that you may already know). Want to know since you've already played the game?
2016-10-01 14:50:49	@Espyo	sure!
2016-10-01 14:50:52	Marty2000	It's not important stuff, really, but interesting
2016-10-01 14:50:54	Marty2000	So...
2016-10-01 14:51:21	Marty2000	When you fight against Team Shadow as team Sonic, this is what Sonic normally says when you start the fight:
2016-10-01 14:51:23	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/39/1475329791-sonic-s-greeting.png
2016-10-01 14:51:40	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-01 14:51:40	Marty2000	With the memory editor, you can switch characters
2016-10-01 14:51:45	Marty2000	(Tails instead of Sonic, for example)
2016-10-01 14:51:48	@Espyo	right
2016-10-01 14:51:53	Marty2000	and even though it can lead to glitches
2016-10-01 14:52:05	Marty2000	it can lead to some characters using lines they wouldn't use in normla gameplay
2016-10-01 14:52:07	Marty2000	and poses
2016-10-01 14:52:13	Marty2000	Let me show you some screenshots
2016-10-01 14:52:22	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/39/1475329791-tails-to-shadow.png
2016-10-01 14:52:33	@Espyo	woah
2016-10-01 14:52:35	Marty2000	Tails would never say that in normal gameplay
2016-10-01 14:52:43	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/39/1475329772-knuckles-to-shadow.jpg
2016-10-01 14:52:50	Marty2000	Or do that :p
2016-10-01 14:52:54	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/39/1475329779-1.png
2016-10-01 14:53:03	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/39/1475329776-2.png
2016-10-01 14:53:10	@Espyo	wow
2016-10-01 14:53:17	@Espyo	those victory poses MIGHT be used in 2-player mode, though
2016-10-01 14:53:28	Marty2000	Yep
2016-10-01 14:53:33	@Espyo	but the lines are interesting
2016-10-01 14:53:38	@Espyo	TCRF doesn't have this written down, I think
2016-10-01 14:53:53	Marty2000	Oh, really?
2016-10-01 14:54:08	Marty2000	I want to try with all teams, by the way. I thought those lines were unused
2016-10-01 14:54:17	Marty2000	Turns out they're not totally unused
2016-10-01 14:54:40	@Espyo	hmm? they're not totally unused? what do you mean?
2016-10-01 14:55:49	Marty2000	I thought you coudln't get them at all in gameplay
2016-10-01 14:55:53	Marty2000	couldn't
2016-10-01 14:56:03	@Espyo	well, you still can't, right?
2016-10-01 14:56:09	Marty2000	It's quite true since you need to hack the game
2016-10-01 14:56:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-01 14:56:18	@Espyo	that counts as unused
2016-10-01 14:56:25	Marty2000	but with hacks, you still get them in-game just by switching characters
2016-10-01 14:56:26	Marty2000	I see
2016-10-01 14:56:36	@Espyo	I mean, it's used in the code, it's not loose content that nothing points to
2016-10-01 14:56:47	@Espyo	but said code is unused, so...
2016-10-01 14:56:55	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/Sonic_Heroes#Rose.27s_Final_Team_Blast like those, you can get them just by switching teams
2016-10-01 14:57:17	Marty2000	I see
2016-10-01 14:59:04	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-01 15:26:19	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0fBjHEiOA woah!
2016-10-01 15:44:36	Marty2000	Wow
2016-10-01 15:44:42	Marty2000	Werid
2016-10-01 15:44:43	Marty2000	Weird
2016-10-01 15:45:12	@Espyo	I wonder if this is the same guy that had that weird full-screen color weirdness thing
2016-10-01 15:46:00	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlCL4drFg
2016-10-01 15:46:01	@Espyo	it's not
2016-10-01 15:52:41	Marty2000	I think it's worth noting that the fruits we see are found at the Twilight River...
2016-10-01 15:53:31	Marty2000	it's where there's a glitch that makes the player respawn at the path to the Scornet Maestro...
2016-10-01 16:07:05	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-10-01 16:07:09	@Espyo	but I really doubt the two are related
2016-10-01 16:07:15	@Espyo	still, good catch
2016-10-01 16:30:25	@Espyo	the others are thinking about adding a "because it's Pikmin" option to the poll
2016-10-01 16:30:26	@Espyo	thoughts?
2016-10-01 16:34:12	Marty2000	Why not, we all like Pikmin here, so I suppose we appreciate any new Pikmin game :P
2016-10-01 16:35:38	@Espyo	yeah, I'm just wondering if that option wouldn't be the one most people would flock to...
2016-10-01 16:36:31	Marty2000	"What are you the most excited about in Pikmin for Nintendo 3DS?"  It's a Pikmin game
2016-10-01 16:36:32	Marty2000	True

2016-10-01 20:45:52	Marty2000	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69jrYlqIV5q1eKg
2016-10-01 20:46:05	Marty2000	May be good to know for when you find screenshots on Miiverse.
2016-10-01 20:46:28	@Espyo	hah
2016-10-01 20:46:29	@Espyo	that's awesome
2016-10-01 20:46:33	@Espyo	but, near, or inside?
2016-10-01 20:47:46	Marty2000	Well, you can't be exactly inside
2016-10-01 20:48:23	Marty2000	So it gives that kind of effect if the creature stands in front of you
2016-10-01 20:48:35	@Espyo	can't the Medusal Slurker absorb you?
2016-10-01 20:48:36	@Espyo	even if temporarily?
2016-10-01 20:48:52	Marty2000	It was dead in that case, by the way
2016-10-01 20:48:57	@Espyo	right
2016-10-01 20:49:01	Marty2000	It can, but it's too short to use the KopPad
2016-10-01 20:49:15	Marty2000	Not even sure you actually can use it when inside the creature
2016-10-01 20:49:22	@Espyo	oh, ok
2016-10-01 20:49:28	@Espyo	I think you can use it when grabbed by a Snitchbug
2016-10-01 20:49:31	@Espyo	that's why I asked
2016-10-01 20:49:47	Marty2000	Yes, I think this is possible
2016-10-01 20:49:49	Marty2000	Okay ;)
2016-10-01 21:10:45	Marty2000	Espyo: I'm going to replace this image with another one without HUD. http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/16/Shaded_Garden_Map.png

2016-10-01 21:11:08	@Espyo	yes, that's great
2016-10-01 21:11:20	@Espyo	although
2016-10-01 21:11:22	@Espyo	look at the center
2016-10-01 21:11:24	@Espyo	the cluster of Rock Pikmin
2016-10-01 21:11:27	@Espyo	one of them is cut off
2016-10-01 21:11:30	Marty2000	Arf
2016-10-01 21:11:32	Marty2000	Yep
2016-10-01 21:11:37	Marty2000	Will retry :P
2016-10-01 21:11:59	@Espyo	the enemy bubble right above that is also a bit weird, but that's okay

2016-10-02 12:19:56	Testyo	Hello everyone!
2016-10-02 12:21:34	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-10-02 12:21:34	Testyo	I don't feel like I was particularly imaginative when I just beat up my yoshi amiibo :S
2016-10-02 12:21:40	@Espyo	hi
2016-10-02 12:22:26	Yoshi2	violence
2016-10-02 12:22:46	@Espyo	gotta beat it up in original ways, though
2016-10-02 12:23:03	Yoshi2	silvagunner ended for real this time and I kinda assumed that it would happen eventually
2016-10-02 12:23:13	Yoshi2	but it's still sad
2016-10-02 12:25:30	@Espyo	definitely...
2016-10-02 12:25:45	@Espyo	I just wish he ended by saying that most of the staff will start uploading rips on their own channels
2016-10-02 12:25:58	@Espyo	instead of this being a goodbye, it's just a "hey, SiIvaGunner as a channel is stopping"
2016-10-02 12:26:01	@Espyo	you can't stop high quality rips
2016-10-02 12:26:11	@Espyo	it's a fun concept, and people will continue to do it
2016-10-02 12:26:18	@Espyo	heck, I bet a LOT of the staff members want to continue too
2016-10-02 12:26:31	@Espyo	but without any sort of closure about where people can find their high quality rips now...
2016-10-02 12:26:35	@Espyo	it feels like everybody is lost
2016-10-02 12:29:53	Yoshi2	https://www.reddit.com/r/GiIvaSunner/comments/55enlk/high_quality_ripper_ama_megathread/ there is this which is cool
2016-10-02 12:35:56	@Espyo	ooh, nice
2016-10-02 12:36:32	@Espyo	>It is unpaid, thankless work.
2016-10-02 12:36:35	@Espyo	now this is just plain unfair
2016-10-02 12:36:37	@Espyo	unpaid? of course
2016-10-02 12:36:41	@Espyo	thankless? are they nuts?
2016-10-02 12:36:53	@Espyo	they've created a phenomenon that will live on for years
2016-10-02 12:37:02	@Espyo	saying that the internet loves high quality rips is a damn understatement
2016-10-02 12:59:51	Yoshi2	people were quite polarized on some of the rips
2016-10-02 13:00:02	Yoshi2	though I wonder who thought the bean rips were a good idea
2016-10-02 13:02:03	@Espyo	the same idiot who did the harlequin baby "joke"
2016-10-02 13:02:13	Yoshi2	serious?
2016-10-02 13:02:15	@Espyo	and hey, the general idea was well liked
2016-10-02 13:02:24	@Espyo	it's just that some rips were too le funny xd
2016-10-02 13:02:30	@Espyo	those were the ones that weren't liked
2016-10-02 13:02:34	@Espyo	and yeah, from what I heard, the same guy
2016-10-02 13:02:54	Yoshi2	the general idea of bean is ok but that ear rape
2016-10-02 13:02:56	Yoshi2	oh joy
2016-10-02 13:04:48	Yoshi2	I also wonder what was with the 9/11 rips
2016-10-02 13:06:04	@Espyo	oh, yeah!
2016-10-02 13:06:07	@Espyo	I nearly forgot about that
2016-10-02 13:08:35	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrO94xtCyRQ right in the feels
2016-10-02 13:14:19	@Espyo	damn
2016-10-02 13:29:47	Yoshi2	some people are very in denial about NMS https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/55e3jf/underneath_anger_is_pain_your_pain/d89r5e1
2016-10-02 13:30:13	Yoshi2	"the REAL fans are over at XYZ playing the game! All the people active here don't have the game or don't care!"
2016-10-02 13:31:36	Yoshi2	the no true scotsman is real
2016-10-02 13:31:57	@Espyo	haha
2016-10-02 13:31:59	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-02 13:37:29	Yoshi2	I'm sure there are people who enjoy the game and I wish them lots of fun but obviously the game is quite flawed if so many high profile negative reviews appear
2016-10-02 13:37:42	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2016-10-02 13:37:59	Yoshi2	and I'm sure somebody would love to be the underdog and attempt to defend the game if it had redeemable qualities
2016-10-02 13:38:20	Yoshi2	but I haven't seen any such positive review appear
2016-10-02 13:40:37	@Espyo	yeah, same
2016-10-02 13:40:52	@Espyo	honestly, most of the people who defend it are the ones that want to justify their purchase
2016-10-02 13:41:03	@Espyo	everybody hates being told they just blew 60 dollars
2016-10-02 13:41:06	@Espyo	it costs 60, right?
2016-10-02 13:42:44	Yoshi2	yup
2016-10-02 13:48:08	Yoshi2	I feel a bit like continuing to play pikmin 2
2016-10-02 13:48:45	Yoshi2	yesterday I was in an aquarium which had very curved glass walls that made stuff look huge and it reminded me a lot of pikmin

2016-10-03 19:40:08	@J	you store columns in a column
2016-10-03 19:40:23	@J	but you just set the column to BLOB
2016-10-03 19:40:41	@J	so the database doesn't know what's in there and you have to tell it how to interpret it every time you use it
2016-10-03 19:40:45	@J	sane, right?
2016-10-03 19:41:57	Yoshi2	isn't there a performance disadvantage to that?
2016-10-03 19:42:01	Marty2000	Hi J
2016-10-03 19:43:24	@J	hmm, probably depends what you're doing

2016-10-04 19:25:44	@Espyo	are any of these simulator games even good?
2016-10-04 19:25:51	@Espyo	most you see is videos of people glitching everywhere on these games
2016-10-04 19:26:31	Yoshi2	euro truck simulator is supposed to be good
2016-10-04 19:26:43	@Espyo	hmm
2016-10-04 19:26:43	Yoshi2	train simulator is a huge cash grab tho as you can see
2016-10-04 19:26:52	@Espyo	yeah, definitely

2016-10-04 19:34:22	Marty2000	It's fine, I had given up because for certain pieces of fruit, you could add more Pikmin as the fruit was being dug up.
2016-10-04 19:35:11	Marty2000	So, that was really hard to add "maximum number of Pikmin" as it could change constantly for some pieces
2016-10-04 19:35:31	Marty2000	I think it's better to put it on the talk page since it's incomplete

2016-10-05 12:29:26	Yoshi2	i moved my torrent directory to a folder on my desktop that I access over network so ayyyyy, nothing stands between me and my anime

2016-10-05 12:40:41	Yoshi2	earlier today the head mod of the NMS subreddit took it down due to frustration with how angry people were at the game
2016-10-05 12:40:45	Yoshi2	and now this happened https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/55yt8y/subreddit_reopening/

2016-10-05 13:18:32	Yoshi2	I really fear that when the game goes on sale for 10 bucks and I play it, it won't be nearly as entertaining as this drama
2016-10-05 13:19:50	Yoshi2	it's been a month and I'm still regulary checking the sub

2016-10-05 13:26:55	@Espyo	not even at 5 bucks you'll feel it's worth
2016-10-05 13:28:22	Yoshi2	to an extent I'm a sucker for exploration so I will probably get SOME value out of it
2016-10-05 13:28:26	Yoshi2	but not in the current state
2016-10-05 13:28:29	Yoshi2	and not at 60 bucks
2016-10-05 13:29:16	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2016-10-05 13:29:24	@Espyo	for like 3 or 4 Euro, you'll likely be good to go

2016-10-05 13:53:43	Yoshi2	hi marty
2016-10-05 13:54:53	@Espyo	hi
2016-10-05 13:55:07	@Espyo	Marty2000: can you help me understand this edit? http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pellet_Posy&curid=1294&diff=169342&oldid=169325
2016-10-05 13:56:38	Marty2000	I think I might understand. You find both pink Pellet Posies and Flukeweeds bearing pellets around the pink Onion.
2016-10-05 13:56:52	Marty2000	Hi, by the way ;)
2016-10-05 13:57:03	Marty2000	But...
2016-10-05 13:57:26	Marty2000	Maybe he deleted that because there are no Flukeweeds only, but Pellet Posies as well
2016-10-05 13:58:04	Marty2000	If I'm wrong, then I don't know why he deleted the part
2016-10-05 13:58:56	Yoshi2	Time to investigate it! Go Marty!
2016-10-05 13:59:50	Marty2000	Investigate what? :P
2016-10-05 13:59:59	Marty2000	The edit?
2016-10-05 14:00:53	Marty2000	Pellet Posies that do not change color are found near the landing sites of where each Onion is first found, except for [[Rock Pikmin]] (where the pellets are encased in [[crystal]]) and [[Winged Pikmin]] (where they are replaced by [[Flukeweed]] bearing pellets)
2016-10-05 14:00:53	Testyo	"Rock_Pikmin" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Rock_Pikmin
2016-10-05 14:01:30	Marty2000	Of course, you can't include Winged Pikmin because there ARE pink-pellet bearing Pellet Posies
2016-10-05 14:01:37	Marty2000	But, there are Flukeweeds as well
2016-10-05 14:01:49	Marty2000	We could still reword that
2016-10-05 14:03:51	Marty2000	 except for Rock Pikmin (where the pellets are encased in crystal). There are still Pellet Posies to be found around the pink Onion, but there are Flukeweeds bearing pink pellets as well.
2016-10-05 14:04:06	Marty2000	I don't know what this looks like, feel free to reword better
2016-10-05 14:04:25	Marty2000	Or we can leave the article as it is if the edit is justified with my semi-explanation
2016-10-05 14:17:01	@Espyo	oh
2016-10-05 14:17:29	@Espyo	yeah, I get it
2016-10-05 14:17:36	@Espyo	although the stocks -> stalks part is kinda wrong
2016-10-05 14:17:41	@Espyo	stocks isn't a typo on stalks

2016-10-05 20:13:20	@Espyo	sqrt expects a double, or a float
2016-10-05 20:13:25	@Espyo	I give it an int in my code
2016-10-05 20:13:31	@Espyo	under Linux, that's fine, because it's cast to float
2016-10-05 20:13:37	@Espyo	under windows... it just doesn't know how to cast
2016-10-05 20:13:42	@Espyo	you know, a basic operation

2016-10-05 20:23:42	@Espyo	GCC apparently SHOULDN'T let me do it
2016-10-05 20:23:47	@Espyo	the "why" is a whole different matter
2016-10-05 20:23:56	@Espyo	I like coding in C++ simply because of the power it gives me
2016-10-05 20:24:03	@Espyo	but fuuuuuuuuck it's so not worth it sometimes
2016-10-05 20:27:57	@Espyo	>const float Gameplay::MESSAGE_CHAR_INTERVAL' is a static data member; it can only be initialized at its definition
2016-10-05 20:27:59	@Espyo	OH HELL NO
2016-10-05 20:28:13	@Espyo	GCC IS TELLING ME DECLARING STUFF ELSEWHERE IS WRONG

2016-10-05 20:31:23	Yoshi2	isn't static for so you don't change the variable at a later point or is that something else
2016-10-05 20:32:05	@Espyo	that's const
2016-10-05 20:32:13	@Espyo	static just means "hey, this is on a class, but it's like it's a global, really"
2016-10-05 20:32:30	@Espyo	like, an int called next_person_id on the class Person
2016-10-05 20:32:38	@Espyo	it's not that every instance of Person has that member
2016-10-05 20:32:44	@Espyo	it's just that that member belongs to the class only
2016-10-05 20:33:01	Yoshi2	ah, it's classes stuff
2016-10-05 20:33:23	Yoshi2	that makes it more retarded than I thought
2016-10-05 20:33:46	@Espyo	I'm honestly not doing anything weird
2016-10-05 20:33:55	@Espyo	it's just that C++ wants me to say "this number = 5" in EXACTLY a certain way
2016-10-05 20:38:44	@Espyo	all right
2016-10-05 20:38:49	@Espyo	constants won't go in the classes
2016-10-05 20:38:52	@Espyo	they'll go as globals

2016-10-05 20:54:38	@Espyo	and one of the answers is to use a bloated library

2016-10-05 21:00:43	@Espyo	>The roundf() function is defined by C99, but MSVC implements very little of C99, so it is not available with the Microsoft compilers.

2016-10-05 21:01:58	Yoshi2	"you can also use a boost library" oh joy
2016-10-05 21:02:08	@Espyo	yeah

2016-10-05 21:03:15	Yoshi2	I think I once saw some question (javascript or something?) and somebody suggested some pretty big lib for a simple problem
2016-10-05 21:03:54	@Espyo	yeah, I fully believe that

2016-10-06 19:12:19	@Espyo	but I released a release candidate for the Splatoon game I was making
2016-10-06 19:12:22	@Espyo	and I need your feedback
2016-10-06 19:12:43	@Espyo	in this game, you don't take the roll of an Inkling that shoots ink
2016-10-06 19:13:07	@Espyo	remember the times where you looked at the GamePad at the end of a match to check which team won?
2016-10-06 19:14:23	@Espyo	it's not easy
2016-10-06 19:14:31	@Espyo	this game grabs that challenge, and explores it to the max

2016-10-06 19:21:37	@Espyo	that should be enough

2016-10-06 19:22:18	Marty2000	The link worked
2016-10-06 19:22:21	Marty2000	Okay ;)
2016-10-06 19:24:31	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-10-06 19:36:06	Marty2000	I like the idea, it's cool. Beginner mode is really easy, but I guess it's for allowing the player to know the game better, right? It's getting tougher in Expert Mode, my best score being only 94 :P Do you have to find the EXACT percentages for the three categories to avoid failure? Also, the only thing I think is missing is a song in the background, maybe?
2016-10-06 19:36:21	Marty2000	Otherwise, it's cool work, Espyo
2016-10-06 19:37:07	@Espyo	thanks!
2016-10-06 19:37:16	@Espyo	and yeah, beginner is meant to be easy
2016-10-06 19:37:24	@Espyo	you need a score of 95 or more to pass
2016-10-06 19:37:26	@Espyo	so you were close
2016-10-06 19:37:38	Marty2000	Ah, I see!
2016-10-06 19:37:49	@Espyo	and yeah, it could use some audio, but it was a quick project, meant purposely to be light and simple
2016-10-06 19:37:53	@Espyo	so audio was out of the question
2016-10-06 19:37:54	Marty2000	I will retry then, want to succeed
2016-10-06 19:38:05	Marty2000	Okay

2016-10-07 18:44:39	Testyo	Evening everyone!
2016-10-07 18:45:16	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-10-07 18:45:16	Testyo	Reminds me of a viration feature that massages my arse
2016-10-07 18:45:26	Yoshi2	that
2016-10-07 18:45:38	Yoshi2	testyo, that is not appropriate
2016-10-07 18:45:38	Testyo	OH recap...
2016-10-07 18:45:57	@Espyo	hi
2016-10-07 18:46:00	@Espyo	all right, recap, Testyo
2016-10-07 18:46:00	Testyo	Severa's map is growing
2016-10-07 18:46:08	@Espyo	what, in a patch update, Testyo?
2016-10-07 18:46:08	Testyo	Oh for it if Gavin is, I just need a shower and stuff
2016-10-07 18:46:15	@Espyo	uh...huh
2016-10-07 18:48:49	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-10-07 18:48:50	Testyo	...meaning that file is unused and repeat
2016-10-07 18:48:57	Marty2000	I see, Testyo...
2016-10-07 18:48:57	Testyo	*** Looking up with stuff happening requires quite a bit of dedication
2016-10-07 18:49:04	Yoshi2	I recently did some sleuthing and found out an Infusion Games developer worked on Battalion Wars
2016-10-07 18:49:25	Yoshi2	now if you never heard of Infusion Games, don't worry
2016-10-07 18:49:44	Yoshi2	I haven't heard of it either till a user claimed IG worked on BW
2016-10-07 18:50:52	Yoshi2	IG is weird because it seems they never made an original game, and most of what they did was probably sub-contracting or something
2016-10-07 18:51:42	Yoshi2	they wanted to make a game but I don't think it ever came out and they dissolved in 2011, and their website was no longer updated soon after the Xbox 360's release
2016-10-07 18:52:38	Yoshi2	yay for the internet archive
2016-10-07 18:53:14	@Espyo	hi

2016-10-07 18:53:38	@Espyo	oh, that sucks for them
2016-10-07 18:53:44	@Espyo	but hey, you got info on a dev
2016-10-07 18:53:48	@Espyo	thinking of getting in contact?
2016-10-07 18:54:13	Yoshi2	nah, all I got is the name and the credits already provide all the names
2016-10-07 18:54:34	Yoshi2	with so much time passed, any company emails will likely no longer be valid
2016-10-07 18:54:46	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-10-07 18:55:20	Yoshi2	ofc I could be a creep and say "i know what your hobbies are now tell me everything i want to know about the game"
2016-10-07 18:55:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-07 18:55:36	Yoshi2	because the website had profiles on the devs
2016-10-07 18:55:49	Yoshi2	but let's just say that will not be a good idea
2016-10-07 18:56:18	@Espyo	"I'm letting you know that I know some of your personal info, so it's only fair you let me know what byte 53 means on units.dat"
2016-10-07 18:56:29	Yoshi2	anyway, I am not particulary interested in getting into contact with the devs, some user just claimed a few things and I wanted to confirm them
2016-10-07 18:56:55	@Espyo	ah
2016-10-07 18:56:57	Yoshi2	the user also claimed n-force, eidos and square enix worked on the game to an extent
2016-10-07 18:57:14	@Espyo	uhm
2016-10-07 18:57:18	@Espyo	that's a bit of a stretch
2016-10-07 18:59:07	Yoshi2	later he retracted the statement to an extent by saying eidos was only distantly related and he wasnt sure about square enix, and he wanted to get proof for both
2016-10-07 19:02:01	Yoshi2	needless to say, this time around I have higher standards for proof
2016-10-07 19:02:06	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-07 19:02:10	Yoshi2	if you have no cold, hard facts then gtfo
2016-10-07 19:05:48	Yoshi2	after I found the IG <-> BW link I became a bit more willing to listen to the claim
2016-10-07 19:08:40	Yoshi2	haven't found an n-fusion <-> BW link yet, need to write code that cross checks the credits of n-fusion games and BW 
2016-10-07 19:15:00	@Espyo	hm
2016-10-07 19:18:10	Yoshi2	time complexity for checking if items from one list exists in another list is O(n*m) with n, m being the length of each list
2016-10-07 19:18:24	Yoshi2	which is horrible for humans
2016-10-07 19:21:13	@Espyo	definitely
2016-10-07 19:21:21	@Espyo	on the plus side
2016-10-07 19:21:25	@Espyo	best case scenario, it's O(1)
2016-10-07 19:21:43	@Espyo	checking if list [a] is inside list [a] should be O(1)
2016-10-07 20:38:06	Yoshi2	Espyo: I would think that the best case scenario is still O(n) for when both lists are identical
2016-10-07 20:38:31	@Espyo	pretty sure it's O(1) on that exact scenario I said
2016-10-07 20:38:40	@Espyo	O(n) for your scenario, though it's not the best case
2016-10-07 20:39:01	@Espyo	of course, it doesn't matter, because in the real world, you don't work by the best case scenario :V
2016-10-07 20:42:20	Yoshi2	I am not sure if it is O(1), O(1) would basically be constant on the length of both lists which is a bit unlikely
2016-10-07 20:43:30	@Espyo	if you always have a check for list [a] inside list [a], it's always the same time :|
2016-10-07 20:43:34	@Espyo	I never said my scenario would happen
2016-10-07 20:43:40	@Espyo	just that it's O(1)
2016-10-07 20:44:06	@Espyo	anyway, aren't there algorithms that make it easier?
2016-10-07 20:44:14	@Espyo	it's like finding a string inside a document
2016-10-07 20:44:23	@Espyo	I've briefly read about one or two algorithms that speed it up
2016-10-07 20:44:24	Yoshi2	i do not quite understand your scenario
2016-10-07 20:44:45	Yoshi2	is [a] a list with the element a
2016-10-07 20:44:47	@Espyo	if you have a program with a list of one member, let's say, a string with the value "a"
2016-10-07 20:44:50	@Espyo	and another list with the same content
2016-10-07 20:44:55	@Espyo	and you check if the first list is inside the second
2016-10-07 20:45:01	@Espyo	that program will always take constant time
2016-10-07 20:46:04	Yoshi2	i am pretty sure it is linear time because you need to make sure that it is identical
2016-10-07 20:47:22	@Espyo	I guess my joke didn't really come across
2016-10-07 20:47:28	@Espyo	that scenario wasn't meant to be an algorithm
2016-10-07 20:47:31	@Espyo	it was meant to be a case
2016-10-07 20:47:41	Yoshi2	the joke really didn't come across
2016-10-07 20:47:47	@Espyo	let's just move on, I guess
2016-10-07 20:54:35	Yoshi2	linear search has a best case of O(1), so a linear search with many elements would likely have a best case of O(n)
2016-10-07 20:55:03	@Espyo	yep

2016-10-07 21:08:45	Yoshi2	you know what is also great

2016-10-07 21:09:17	Yoshi2	oh wow that link was much longer than expected
2016-10-07 21:09:37	@Espyo	at least the solution doesn't seem that long
2016-10-07 21:09:59	Yoshi2	... and now I'm getting "Incorrect function" as an error
2016-10-07 21:10:40	Yoshi2	i just want to move some stuff from my desktop to my phone using samba (because the usb port on the phone is broken and can only charge)
2016-10-07 21:11:45	Yoshi2	oh I had to restart the app on my phone
2016-10-07 21:12:47	Yoshi2	alright, it works now
2016-10-07 21:32:39	@Espyo	that's a relief
2016-10-07 21:32:44	@Espyo	and surprising

2016-10-08 12:37:34	@Espyo	sleep
2016-10-08 12:37:48	Yoshi2	what
2016-10-08 12:37:51	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-08 12:37:53	Yoshi2	but you go off at 0 am
2016-10-08 12:37:53	@Espyo	midnight to midday
2016-10-08 12:37:59	@Espyo	I sleep a LOT during weekends
2016-10-08 12:38:04	Yoshi2	0-12 is a LONG sleep
2016-10-08 12:38:15	@Espyo	really is, but iunno, I've always been able to sleep that long
2016-10-08 12:38:25	@Espyo	during the week, I go from midnight to 8
2016-10-08 12:38:30	@Espyo	I guess my body doesn't find that enough
2016-10-08 12:38:43	@Espyo	since I won't feel refreshed unless I sleep some 11 or 12 hours during both Saturday and Sunday
2016-10-08 12:39:13	Yoshi2	oh wow
2016-10-08 12:39:44	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-08 12:39:52	@Espyo	I never quite understood how doctors recommend 7 to 8 hours of sleep every day
2016-10-08 12:39:54	Yoshi2	i have trouble sleeping for too long because sometimes I will just wake up at 8 or 9 and then it's RIP sleep
2016-10-08 12:39:55	@Espyo	I'll die if I do that
2016-10-08 12:40:13	@Espyo	yeah, I think different people just sleep for different amounts of time
2016-10-08 12:40:22	@Espyo	and that's just how it is
2016-10-08 12:40:26	@Espyo	forget the nonsense 7-hour rule

2016-10-08 12:55:29	@Espyo	my idea was that I'd delete the article, and greet them with the standard message
2016-10-08 12:56:19	@Espyo	but then add something like "unfortunately, your article got deleted because it's not an article on any real subject in the series. we have a special way of doing guide articles, and if you want to put your opinions on something, you can use the forums or your own user page for that, instead of a wiki article"

2016-10-08 13:00:37	@Espyo	don't think I ever tried that

2016-10-08 13:47:06	@Espyo	could you please test it and see if everything is working fine? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/Life_of_Judd_1.0.zip
2016-10-08 13:49:12	Yoshi2	my antivirus isn't complaining so that looks good
2016-10-08 13:49:32	@Espyo	tell me about it
2016-10-08 13:53:04	Yoshi2	it doesn't crash on startup on my win8 notebook so that is good too
2016-10-08 13:53:16	Yoshi2	and i can play it but I guess there is no sound
2016-10-08 13:55:09	Yoshi2	starts on my vista computer too
2016-10-08 13:55:20	Yoshi2	probably time to actually finish it
2016-10-08 14:03:48	Yoshi2	pretty nice gameplay idea though
2016-10-08 14:13:33	Yoshi2	woooooot, in one match I was 0.2 close to the actual result
2016-10-08 14:14:28	@Espyo	nice
2016-10-08 14:14:35	Yoshi2	and again
2016-10-08 14:14:42	@Espyo	yeah, the game doesn't have sound, so that's good
2016-10-08 14:14:52	@Espyo	thanks for taking the extra time to test on multiple machines, too
2016-10-08 14:14:54	@Espyo	it really means a lot
2016-10-08 14:15:06	@Espyo	if you're 0.2 away, you get 100 points anyway, right?
2016-10-08 14:15:11	@Espyo	or you might get 99
2016-10-08 14:15:24	Yoshi2	yup
2016-10-08 14:15:31	@Espyo	good, the calculations work
2016-10-08 14:15:59	Yoshi2	100 happened and 99 happened too
2016-10-08 14:16:32	@Espyo	probably rounding shenanigans
2016-10-08 14:16:41	@Espyo	but it's all a part of the game
2016-10-08 14:16:44	@Espyo	well, that's a massive release

2016-10-08 14:38:12	@Espyo	excellent
2016-10-08 14:38:13	Yoshi2	and the last chapter seems to work on my desktop too
2016-10-08 14:38:18	@Espyo	thank you
2016-10-08 14:38:32	Yoshi2	and I did some free mode, seems to not crash either
2016-10-08 14:38:48	Yoshi2	the game receives the "good enough" stamp of approval from me
2016-10-08 14:38:54	@Espyo	woop
2016-10-08 14:39:07	@Espyo	hey, can you check the memory usage real quick?
2016-10-08 14:39:16	@Espyo	by going on free mode, starting a match, leaving that match, starting a new one, etc.
2016-10-08 14:39:21	@Espyo	check the memory usage as soon as you boot the game
2016-10-08 14:39:27	@Espyo	and after you go back-and-forth some 10 times, please
2016-10-08 14:39:42	@Espyo	it looks like there's a memory leak on my end, but I can't find anything wrong on the code
2016-10-08 14:39:54	Yoshi2	starting, it is at 64 MB
2016-10-08 14:40:16	@Espyo	can you get more granular?
2016-10-08 14:41:37	Yoshi2	starting/leaving story chapters, it went up to 72.3 MB
2016-10-08 14:41:45	@Espyo	:(
2016-10-08 14:41:54	Yoshi2	huh it is at 63 now
2016-10-08 14:41:54	@Espyo	it's a bit significant...but I can't understand why
2016-10-08 14:41:57	@Espyo	what
2016-10-08 14:42:31	@Espyo	...I don't think it's worth thinking about
2016-10-08 14:42:37	@Espyo	unless people are playing this on a 1994 machine
2016-10-08 14:43:18	Yoshi2	starting and leaving free mode, it went up to 100 then drops down to 81
2016-10-08 14:43:36	@Espyo	that's so nonsense
2016-10-08 14:44:25	Yoshi2	there is a mild case of memory leak and an attempt at garbage collecting
2016-10-08 14:44:44	@Espyo	yeah, that seems to be the case
2016-10-08 14:44:52	@Espyo	but
2016-10-08 14:44:57	@Espyo	there's no garbage collection system working
2016-10-08 14:45:02	@Espyo	is it implied by the operative system or something?
2016-10-08 14:46:26	Yoshi2	maybe the code frees up some memory and the system registers that with a bit of a delay
2016-10-08 14:46:53	Yoshi2	the memory leak also happens if you go from one stage to the next
2016-10-08 14:47:34	@Espyo	right...
2016-10-08 14:47:39	@Espyo	I'll settle with that, for now
2016-10-08 14:48:32	Yoshi2	the memory leak is definitely real though, even when taking into consideration that some memory is made free again
2016-10-08 14:50:06	Yoshi2	I did a number of matches and now the game is at 104.5 MB
2016-10-08 14:50:29	Yoshi2	would be interesting to figure out how much memory is freed vs how much memory stays per match
2016-10-08 14:51:40	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-08 14:51:44	@Espyo	but that's a problem for another time, I guess
2016-10-08 14:51:47	@Espyo	thanks for the help, once more
2016-10-08 14:53:23	Yoshi2	my guess is that it's maybe 1.something MB per match of memory leak, so probably not going to cause any issues unless somebody REALLY tries hard

2016-10-08 15:08:07	@Espyo	isn't that just implied facts?

2016-10-08 15:13:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-08 15:17:34	Yoshi2	I will still buy the game for 10 bucks at a later point because that is the least I could do for a game that provided months worth of drama and entertainment

2016-10-08 18:04:54	@Espyo	fair enough

2016-10-08 18:11:53	Yoshi2	that blur is out of control
2016-10-08 19:07:21	@Espyo	https://twitter.com/thebag1981/status/769833434877427712
2016-10-08 19:14:31	Yoshi2	accurate
2016-10-08 20:16:24	Yoshi2	the bw model format will drive me insane https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/deda708e98c2a475c08d88c751c9ce4f
2016-10-08 20:16:25	Testyo	4 F = -15.5556 °C / 257.594 K
2016-10-08 20:16:33	Yoshi2	thx testyo
2016-10-08 20:16:33	Testyo	I don't mess has no seeds
2016-10-08 20:17:00	@Espyo	eep
2016-10-08 20:17:04	@Espyo	but welp, that's just the way it is
2016-10-08 20:17:06	@Espyo	hey, listen
2016-10-08 20:17:07	Yoshi2	so basically this format has MEMX at the start and TCNC at the end, and inbetween a bunch of EDON thingies
2016-10-08 20:17:10	@Espyo	that repo of your is private
2016-10-08 20:17:13	@Espyo	did you pay for that?
2016-10-08 20:17:35	Yoshi2	i didnt do nothing
2016-10-08 20:17:39	Yoshi2	that's a secret gist
2016-10-08 20:18:45	@Espyo	uuuuhh
2016-10-08 20:18:49	@Espyo	what's a gist?
2016-10-08 20:19:03	Yoshi2	you are one of today's lucky 10 thousand!
2016-10-08 20:19:30	@Espyo	oh boy?
2016-10-08 20:19:38	Yoshi2	github gists are just thingies for sharing text files that don't deserve their own repo
2016-10-08 20:19:55	Yoshi2	I use it like a pastebin
2016-10-08 20:20:34	@Espyo	oh
2016-10-08 20:20:36	@Espyo	neat
2016-10-08 20:20:50	Yoshi2	ok so back to the format
2016-10-08 20:21:22	@Espyo	how do you know the names of these blocks? are they named with a magic number?
2016-10-08 20:21:27	Yoshi2	the EDON thingies are model parts and somehow the model is assembled from them
2016-10-08 20:21:34	Yoshi2	yes, magic 4 byte string
2016-10-08 20:28:34	Yoshi2	I was able to confirm that the edon header specifies position of the parts 
2016-10-08 20:28:38	Yoshi2	but idk about the rest
2016-10-08 20:30:57	@Espyo	honestly, it could be anything...
2016-10-08 20:31:57	Yoshi2	assuming the people were sane, one of the pieces of data will tell me how many data sections will follo
2016-10-08 20:31:59	Yoshi2	w
2016-10-08 20:32:07	Yoshi2	which I'm currently trying to figure out
2016-10-08 20:33:05	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-08 20:33:25	Yoshi2	27 - 0x14, 23 - 0x10, 18 - 0x10, 20 - 0x10
2016-10-08 20:33:27	Yoshi2	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-10-08 20:36:38	Yoshi2	no wait, further down I saw an instance with 0x10 but there were 0 data entries
2016-10-08 20:39:28	Yoshi2	and then I saw an instance of 0x14 with only 14 entries (spoiler: 14 < 0x14)
2016-10-08 20:39:38	Yoshi2	that kills my theory
2016-10-08 20:43:19	@Espyo	:(
2016-10-08 20:44:43	Yoshi2	assuming that the people who made this format were sane was a mistake
2016-10-08 20:45:24	Yoshi2	i see no direct connection between amount of data sections and stuff in the edon header
2016-10-08 20:57:11	Yoshi2	ehh, tomorrow I will try to track down how to tell between an empty model part and a full one
2016-10-08 20:57:19	Yoshi2	and that will be about it
2016-10-08 20:57:27	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-08 20:58:05	Yoshi2	in theory I can tell already by the amount of data sections but I wonder if there is something in the header
2016-10-08 20:59:07	Yoshi2	and empty vs full is a huge difference so maybe it will tell more about the header info
2016-10-08 21:00:12	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-08 21:12:13	Yoshi2	but it is very thankless work annd OH MY GOD could the neighbours be any louder with stomping on the floor
2016-10-08 21:12:47	@Espyo	you never had a jolly "march-during-hackatons" session?
2016-10-08 21:13:16	Yoshi2	the heck is that
2016-10-08 21:13:40	@Espyo	it's whatever your neighbors are doing
2016-10-08 21:13:45	Yoshi2	i am sure the neighbours are not doing any hackatons 
2016-10-08 21:13:52	@Espyo	no, you're doing the hackaton
2016-10-08 21:13:55	@Espyo	the neighbors are doing the marching
2016-10-08 21:14:03	Yoshi2	oh
2016-10-08 21:16:40	Yoshi2	how about the "march-during-sleep"
2016-10-08 21:17:01	@Espyo	truly a classic
2016-10-08 21:19:05	Yoshi2	i will try to sleep anyway, good night
2016-10-08 21:20:04	@Espyo	night
2016-10-08 21:20:57	Yoshi2	the worst part about this reverse engineering is that it isn't that difficult but still very little people get it
2016-10-08 21:21:21	Yoshi2	well, to an extent that would be helpful to me
2016-10-08 21:21:53	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-10-08 21:21:59	@Espyo	on the bright side, you're better than a lot of people at it
2016-10-08 21:22:37	Yoshi2	give me the format of a different game and i will be a helpless child again
2016-10-08 21:24:02	@Espyo	yeah, but you're still better than most people at it
2016-10-08 21:24:21	@Espyo	I'm a complete dip at reverse-engineering
2016-10-08 21:24:52	@Espyo	still don't think dip is an insult, but it sounds too much like one
2016-10-08 21:25:03	Yoshi2	heh
2016-10-08 21:25:41	Yoshi2	at some point i might just make a randomizer/corruptor for BW and call it a day
2016-10-08 21:26:11	@Espyo	that'd be sick
2016-10-08 21:26:18	@Espyo	people are really into it these days
2016-10-08 21:27:50	Yoshi2	my current knowledge of the game is good enough to write a fairly extensive corruptor
2016-10-08 21:29:12	Yoshi2	switching out textures and models, sure. Messing with firepower, why not. Unit positions? Yus. screw up all the textures completely? doing that by accident already. And now screwing the models would be possible too
2016-10-08 21:30:01	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-08 21:31:50	Yoshi2	just quite a bit of work
2016-10-08 21:32:23	Yoshi2	like lots of it
2016-10-08 21:33:23	@Espyo	oh, definitely
2016-10-08 21:35:06	Yoshi2	but now for real bedtime

2016-10-10 22:21:40	@Espyo	nice!
2016-10-10 22:22:07	Neocraftz1553	I think I'm a qualified splatoon judge now :p
2016-10-10 22:23:12	Neocraftz1553	It's an interesting game, it took me a second to figure out the mechanics of "easy" mode, though
2016-10-10 22:23:28	@Espyo	really? hmm...
2016-10-10 22:23:35	@Espyo	not quite sure what I could've done to make it easier
2016-10-10 22:23:44	@Espyo	that's interesting to know though
2016-10-10 22:23:50	Neocraftz1553	heh, it IS easy mode, after all
2016-10-10 22:24:28	Neocraftz1553	The other modes have percentages, which are sorta self explanitory(slide them)
2016-10-10 22:24:51	Neocraftz1553	Easy mode has unlabeled buttons, which I thought were for decoration at first
2016-10-10 22:24:59	Neocraftz1553	gtg, cyas

2016-10-11 16:40:11	Yoshi2	watching anime and trying to make modding progress on battalion wars
2016-10-11 16:40:14	Yoshi2	how about yo
2016-10-11 16:41:09	Neocraftz1553	Working on my game, trying to catch up in math, and learning how to use ableton live more effectively.
2016-10-11 16:42:35	Yoshi2	neat, what do you do with ableton live?
2016-10-11 16:44:15	Neocraftz1553	Its a digital audio workstation, so basically, it lets you make music
2016-10-11 16:45:14	Yoshi2	seems like it is commercial, do you have a full license or just a trial? 
2016-10-11 16:47:08	Neocraftz1553	sort of a license, sort of a trail
2016-10-11 16:47:35	Neocraftz1553	Its for one of my classes, so the instructor had to activate it
2016-10-11 16:49:03	Yoshi2	oh cool
2016-10-11 16:50:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah

2016-10-11 16:59:28	Neocraftz1553	Good

2016-10-11 17:45:23	Neocraftz1553	They are different play tests, one with a red plane, and one with a blue plane
2016-10-11 17:45:37	Neocraftz1553	The upgraded weapons each have the same color as the user

2016-10-12 20:28:28	Yoshi2	J your tool is so great that I prefer GC modding over Wii modding because your script rebuilds the disc so quickly
2016-10-12 20:28:58	@Espyo	wait, he's got a script?
2016-10-12 20:29:02	@Espyo	I thought the only tool he made was a gui
2016-10-12 20:29:16	@Espyo	so, can you replace a file in the disk and save it with a simple command?
2016-10-12 20:29:25	@Espyo	because if so, I need that, and I need that now
2016-10-12 20:29:42	Yoshi2	I need to do some modding on the Wii and wiimms tool takes a while
2016-10-12 20:32:41	Yoshi2	Espyo: j was so nice to grab the relevant parts from the GUI and make it into a script (plus even a thing to show rebuild progress)
2016-10-12 20:33:37	@Espyo	sick
2016-10-12 20:33:39	@Espyo	I need these
2016-10-12 20:34:32	Yoshi2	idk about replacing a single file but it can replace an entire directory from disc
2016-10-12 20:36:25	@Espyo	that should be fine
2016-10-12 20:36:31	Yoshi2	presumably can do a single file too

2016-10-12 20:58:58	Yoshi2	Espyo: i lost the dl link to it so here, have a shady looking link in which I also put two bats I wrote that I use for convenience:

2016-10-12 21:00:27	@Espyo	thanks
2016-10-12 21:00:38	@Espyo	I'll want virus.bat, right?
2016-10-12 21:01:15	Yoshi2	no no no, you want the pikmin4-devbuild.bat one
2016-10-12 21:04:33	@Espyo	right
2016-10-12 21:04:56	Yoshi2	build_bw1.bat just calls gcedit.bat with an argument anyway, while gcedit-cli.bat contains my setup
2016-10-12 21:05:27	Yoshi2	s/gcedit.bat/gcedit-cli.bat
2016-10-12 21:10:07	@Espyo	right
2016-10-12 21:10:39	Yoshi2	confusing but you can give it better names or do it completely differently
2016-10-12 21:11:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-12 21:11:11	@Espyo	I'll have to rebuild them anyway
2016-10-12 21:11:15	@Espyo	since bat doesn't really exist on Linux
2016-10-12 21:12:13	Yoshi2	indeed

2016-10-12 22:45:54	Neocraftz1553	Espyo, can you give me some feedback on this render?
2016-10-12 22:46:15	@Espyo	sure
2016-10-12 22:46:43	Neocraftz1553	Its dark, so you may want to turn up your brightness

2016-10-12 22:48:24	@Espyo	well, I'm not sure about my artistic taste
2016-10-12 22:48:32	@Espyo	but all of that dead space on the right seems a bit of a waste
2016-10-12 22:48:37	@Espyo	though on the other hand, it is pretty centered
2016-10-12 22:48:40	@Espyo	so it's good too
2016-10-12 22:48:43	@Espyo	all in all, it's pretty nice
2016-10-12 22:50:08	Neocraftz1553	I might add in a table and some pictures on the left wall, since it is kinda plain

2016-10-13 19:44:05	Yoshi2	Espyo: any suggestions for this thing I'm adding to tcrf: https://i.imgur.com/xKGM1Pt.png
2016-10-13 19:45:16	@Espyo	besides the first sentence of that paragraph being wrong
2016-10-13 19:45:25	@Espyo	you should have game titles in italics only
2016-10-13 19:45:29	@Espyo	forget bold
2016-10-13 19:45:34	@Espyo	other than that it's great
2016-10-13 19:46:07	Yoshi2	Always italicize game titles: 
2016-10-13 19:46:11	Yoshi2	ooops, I missed that thing
2016-10-13 19:46:24	Yoshi2	Always bold and italicize a game title when it appears in its own article description: 
2016-10-13 19:46:34	Yoshi2	and both bold and italics is for the description only
2016-10-13 19:48:00	Yoshi2	I wonder if I should add a source for the "Knight Wars was in development in 2006/2007" thing (it would be an Unseen64 article) or if it will be fine
2016-10-13 19:49:36	@Espyo	the source can't hurt
2016-10-13 19:49:41	@Espyo	though TCRF doesn't really do usual sourcing
2016-10-13 19:49:45	@Espyo	like, a <ref> tag
2016-10-13 19:49:50	@Espyo	so I'm not quite sure how you'd do it
2016-10-13 19:50:44	Yoshi2	it has a {source} thing but that can't be put in the middle of a text
2016-10-13 19:52:42	@Espyo	yeah, that's not its purpose
2016-10-13 19:55:05	Yoshi2	something like this maybe? https://i.imgur.com/fpPeL1V.png (See [https://www.unseen64.net/2011/06/14/knight-wars-wii-cancelled/])
2016-10-13 19:55:21	@Espyo	that works
2016-10-13 19:55:26	@Espyo	admins can change it if they don't like it
2016-10-13 20:01:59	Yoshi2	I realized something in the article snippet on that unseen page
2016-10-13 20:02:31	Yoshi2	"Based in middle-aged England, players control tens of thousands of troops including units such as horses, magicians and Knights!"
2016-10-13 20:03:22	@Espyo	tens of thousands, eh?
2016-10-13 20:03:31	Yoshi2	but if the games shared engines, the engine would NEVER be able to handle ten thousands or even just one thousand units under the player's control
2016-10-13 20:04:45	@Espyo	maybe each technical unit is just a bundle of 100 people
2016-10-13 20:05:07	Yoshi2	probably
2016-10-13 20:05:12	Yoshi2	100 very low-poly people
2016-10-13 20:08:35	@Espyo	mhm
2016-10-13 20:31:23	Yoshi2	Espyo: how is this for a summary: "Knight Wars strings + formatting"
2016-10-13 20:42:29	Yoshi2	or Marty2000 for that matter

2016-10-13 20:48:20	@Espyo	summary isn't very important
2016-10-13 20:48:21	@Espyo	sorry, was away
2016-10-13 20:49:06	Yoshi2	thought so much, some people even leave it out completely

2016-10-13 20:50:26	@Espyo	yep

2016-10-14 20:01:34	Marty2000	I can try, yes. What do I need to do?
2016-10-14 20:04:10	@Espyo	ok, so
2016-10-14 20:04:16	@Espyo	OmegaZero on Discord told me about a glitch he found
2016-10-14 20:04:19	@Espyo	very simple
2016-10-14 20:04:35	@Espyo	if you recover an Exploration Kit treasure, and then use the pause menu to leave the cave instead of using a geyser
2016-10-14 20:04:42	@Espyo	you will still get the upgrade
2016-10-14 20:04:55	@Espyo	even though you said that if the cave is quit via the pause menu, the upgrade is removed
2016-10-14 20:05:04	@Espyo	we even added that to the wiki: [[Upgrade]] (3rd paragraph)
2016-10-14 20:05:04	Testyo	"Upgrade" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Upgrade
2016-10-14 20:05:19	@Espyo	he has video of this happening, and yesterday, he tried Pikmin 2 GC JP, and it still keeps the upgrade
2016-10-14 20:05:35	@Espyo	so, could you provide more info about the game taking the upgrade away from you?
2016-10-14 20:09:55	Marty2000	I don't even remember that :P I guess it does keep the upgrade but not the treasure (?)
2016-10-14 20:10:14	Marty2000	Hmmm,  may try on Dolphin...
2016-10-14 20:11:17	@Espyo	he said it works with the first globe treasure
2016-10-14 20:11:19	@Espyo	so it'll be easy to test
2016-10-14 20:11:23	@Espyo	can you check it out, please?
2016-10-14 20:11:34	@Espyo	that could well be intended behavior, anyway
2016-10-14 20:11:48	@Espyo	but he DID say that if you get the Rocket Fist and then cancel out of the cave
2016-10-14 20:11:56	@Espyo	you still get the third punch, but are unable to hit airborne enemies
2016-10-14 20:11:58	@Espyo	now THAT is weird
2016-10-14 20:12:18	Marty2000	I see
2016-10-14 20:13:48	Marty2000	I'm checking, by the way. I have to restart a save, though, so that'll take 15-20 minutes, more or less
2016-10-14 20:24:48	@Espyo	oh, okay
2016-10-14 20:24:51	@Espyo	good luck
2016-10-14 20:28:31	Marty2000	Espyo: I left via the pause menu, and I lost the treasure but kept the upgrade, which allowed me to unlock the Awakening Wood
2016-10-14 20:29:08	@Espyo	oh
2016-10-14 20:29:13	@Espyo	guess that's it, then
2016-10-14 20:29:21	@Espyo	you always keep the upgrade
2016-10-14 20:29:25	@Espyo	the info we have on the wiki is false :S
2016-10-14 20:29:42	@Espyo	hm, I might be able to test the punch thing
2016-10-14 20:29:50	@Espyo	I know the addresses to the upgrades you've got and the treasures you've got, I think
2016-10-14 20:29:56	@Espyo	I can just give myself 0 treasures, but all upgrades
2016-10-14 20:30:05	Marty2000	Cool
2016-10-14 20:30:13	Marty2000	You remind me of this with the upgrade thing:

2016-10-14 20:30:59	Marty2000	Remember, I told you that that happened because the off-camera "glitch" affected the Pikmin
2016-10-14 20:31:05	Marty2000	(in P3 only)
2016-10-14 20:31:40	Marty2000	and you have to be quite far (not too much, but don't be too close)
2016-10-14 20:31:57	Marty2000	So, this category (or at least the Mission Mode "rules") should be deleted ASAP
2016-10-14 20:32:25	@Espyo	oh, that never got updated
2016-10-14 20:32:45	@Espyo	I forgot what the result of the maturity weirdness really is
2016-10-14 20:32:48	@Espyo	can you fix it?
2016-10-14 20:32:52	@Espyo	I'll fix the upgrade page

2016-10-14 21:08:51	Marty2000	Maybe because it's less powerful in P3? But I doubt it.
2016-10-14 21:08:53	@Espyo	yeah, same
2016-10-14 21:09:07	@Espyo	yeah, because it's insanely less useful
2016-10-14 21:09:45	Marty2000	True, especially when compared to that of P2 :P

2016-10-14 21:17:44	@J	[23:11:55] @J anyway, apparently a Wii disk contains multiple partitions, each of which is a possibly-encrypted GC filesystem

2016-10-15 12:47:14	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-10-15 12:47:15	Testyo	Its incentive to buy the NX yeah, but the Wii U hasn't had a Zelda game of its cool, we don't lose points
2016-10-15 12:47:26	@Espyo	hi
2016-10-15 12:59:23	Yoshi2	random info from the front lines: I found out that the health pickup mechanic in battalion wars is prone to overflows because health is stored as signed 16 bit ints while health pickups have gains stored as 32 bit (unsigned?) integers
2016-10-15 13:01:19	@Espyo	hah
2016-10-15 13:01:23	@Espyo	of course, realistically, that'll never happen
2016-10-15 13:01:50	@Espyo	what if they're not unsigned?
2016-10-15 13:01:57	@Espyo	you can probably have health packs that harm you
2016-10-15 13:02:03	@Espyo	what if you DIE from a health pack?
2016-10-15 13:02:24	Yoshi2	oh wait the health packs are signed 32 bit integers
2016-10-15 13:02:36	Yoshi2	still, 16 bits < 32 bits
2016-10-15 13:02:51	@Espyo	oh so they are signed
2016-10-15 13:02:56	@Espyo	you know what to do next
2016-10-15 13:03:15	Yoshi2	there is a reason why I mentioned the overflow thing
2016-10-15 13:03:24	Yoshi2	if the health overflows your unit dies
2016-10-15 13:03:48	@Espyo	ah
2016-10-15 13:03:59	Yoshi2	because it seems they first do "health = health + pickupHealth"
2016-10-15 13:04:13	Yoshi2	and then "if health > max: health = max"
2016-10-15 13:04:28	Yoshi2	something like that
2016-10-15 13:04:38	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-15 13:05:41	Yoshi2	which means you cannot have a unit with 30k health and pickups with >2k health
2016-10-15 13:05:42	Testyo	30 K = -243.15 °C / -405.67 °F
2016-10-15 13:06:08	Yoshi2	the game narrowly dodges that because the strongest unit has 26k health and the biggest health pickup is 3.75k
2016-10-15 13:06:08	Testyo	26 K = -247.15 °C / -412.87 °F
2016-10-15 13:10:34	@Espyo	oh
2016-10-15 13:10:41	@Espyo	I wasn't aware that was actually a possible danger
2016-10-15 13:10:51	@Espyo	I figured healths with go up to 1000 at most
2016-10-15 13:11:02	@Espyo	and pickups also at 1000 at most
2016-10-15 13:12:12	@J	that sounds like something they noticed and it was easier to tweak the numbers than fix the code
2016-10-15 13:12:13	Yoshi2	the game has a rule of health pickups being 10% of whatever unit you killed (soldiers drop health packs and tanks drop jerry cans) 
2016-10-15 13:16:06	@Espyo	vampirism
2016-10-15 13:16:08	@Espyo	classic war strategy
2016-10-15 13:17:48	Yoshi2	this game is so object-oriented it hurts
2016-10-15 13:18:13	Yoshi2	a vehicle has a vehiclebase object
2016-10-15 13:18:32	@Espyo	hehe
2016-10-15 13:18:41	@Espyo	all the better for you, though
2016-10-15 13:19:04	Yoshi2	a vehiclebase object has, besides a crapload of attributes, also a physics object, seat objects, sprite objects,...
2016-10-15 13:19:16	Yoshi2	a seat object references a weapon object
2016-10-15 13:19:29	Yoshi2	a weapon object has a bullet object
2016-10-15 13:23:16	Yoshi2	a bullet object can have impact objects
2016-10-15 13:23:26	Yoshi2	impact objects can have an explosion object
2016-10-15 13:23:50	Yoshi2	lots of rabbit holes
2016-10-15 13:23:54	Yoshi2	and they all go deep

2016-10-15 14:59:39	@Espyo	this looks like the exit hole to the Plasm Wraith's arena
2016-10-15 15:00:03	@Espyo	maybe it happens if you have one leader right on the exit, and another leader elsewhere, and just switch up the leaders
2016-10-15 15:00:43	@Espyo	can you test real quick?
2016-10-15 15:00:49	@Espyo	I've also found some other glitches that can be tested
2016-10-15 15:00:57	@Espyo	I wanted to test these myself, but I can't find the time...
2016-10-15 16:38:43	Marty2000	I'm busy right now, but I'll be able to test stuff in a few hours ;)
2016-10-15 16:39:01	@Espyo	all right
2016-10-15 19:48:51	Yoshi2	another video done; battalion wars has a pretty decent physics engine that makes stuff like this pretty fun to do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5vwzLCmMlY
2016-10-15 19:50:55	@Espyo	I'll have to watch that later
2016-10-15 19:58:42	@Espyo	oh, GREAT
2016-10-15 19:58:53	@Espyo	in caves, there's this room that's plus-shaped
2016-10-15 19:59:06	@Espyo	the game's files have enemy spawn coordinates for this room
2016-10-15 19:59:08	@Espyo	some 10 or so
2016-10-15 19:59:13	@Espyo	only ONE of these is not out-of-bounds
2016-10-15 19:59:20	@Espyo	if they were all in-bounds, the game would pick randomly between them
2016-10-15 19:59:21	@Espyo	but it CAN'T
2016-10-15 19:59:35	@Espyo	because for some reason the devs decided it's cool to have 9 out of 10 coordinates be completely invalid
2016-10-15 20:00:52	Yoshi2	is it a used cave room?
2016-10-15 20:03:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-10-15 20:03:39	@Espyo	unfortunately
2016-10-15 20:03:54	@Espyo	all I want is to understand the minimum and maximum number of enemies that can appear in each level
2016-10-15 20:04:02	@Espyo	I don't care if I have to cross-check 10 files
2016-10-15 20:04:06	@Espyo	but this?
2016-10-15 20:04:14	@Espyo	I just have NO way of knowing if a coordinate is out of bounds
2016-10-15 20:04:21	@Espyo	and this is important for more than just location
2016-10-15 20:04:38	@Espyo	because each spawn coordinate also decides "in this spot, the game can spawn 2 enemies"
2016-10-15 20:04:40	@Espyo	"or 3"
2016-10-15 20:04:41	@Espyo	"or 1"
2016-10-15 20:04:45	@Espyo	"because I decide randomly"
2016-10-15 20:04:47	@Espyo	"because life can't be simple"
2016-10-15 20:05:46	@Espyo	ok, so let me try to gather my thoughts so far, about how I'd figure out the number of enemies to spawn
2016-10-15 20:05:57	@Espyo	in the cave's file, the game decides how many enemies it WANTS to spawn, and what types
2016-10-15 20:06:07	@Espyo	then, I have to cross-check with the cave's list of units, which is in another file
2016-10-15 20:06:24	@Espyo	and for every one of those units, cross-check with its spawn coordinates, which are in a different file
2016-10-15 20:06:51	@Espyo	and for each coordinate...figure out those that are valid, as well as their possible vacancy numbers
2016-10-15 20:06:57	@Espyo	that's certainly not convoluted
2016-10-15 20:07:25	@Espyo	it'd be easier to painstakingly do every sublevel in the game 100 times to find the minimums and maximums of each enemy
2016-10-15 20:14:39	Yoshi2	the simple and boring way or the difficult and slightly less boring way
2016-10-15 20:14:53	@Espyo	;_;
2016-10-15 20:15:08	Yoshi2	write a program to do it
2016-10-15 20:15:15	Yoshi2	:>
2016-10-15 20:15:42	@Espyo	that was my plan to begin with
2016-10-15 20:15:50	@Espyo	but I still have no way of knowing which are out of bounds
2016-10-15 20:16:58	@Espyo	oh, and what if a cave uses two rooms, one with only one valid spawn position, and another with tons of them
2016-10-15 20:17:18	@Espyo	and the game decides to have all of this cave's rooms be the ones with only one position
2016-10-15 20:17:25	@Espyo	the number of enemies that can spawn is limited by that stupid room
2016-10-15 20:17:38	@Espyo	I think that's a bit extreme, but it's more drama to think about
2016-10-15 20:19:45	@Espyo	oh, and SZS files can't have different sizes from what they used to be
2016-10-15 20:19:53	@Espyo	that sent me on a goose chase for a good hour until I realized that
2016-10-15 20:20:07	@Espyo	I don't care about the limitation, I can just add or delete characters in comments to fit the size
2016-10-15 20:20:14	@Espyo	but eesh, until I realized, it was one good headache
2016-10-15 20:21:40	Yoshi2	but aren't szs files compressed files? So one character added/deleted isn't always exactly one byte more or less
2016-10-15 20:22:11	@Espyo	oh, I didn't explain it right
2016-10-15 20:22:12	@Espyo	sorry
2016-10-15 20:22:20	@Espyo	I meant that the files inside the SZS files have to keep the same size
2016-10-15 20:22:27	Yoshi2	oh
2016-10-15 20:22:27	@Espyo	the final SZS can be a different size, it looks like
2016-10-15 20:24:57	Yoshi2	that does make work easier
2016-10-15 20:25:15	@Espyo	yeah, thankfully
2016-10-15 20:33:06	@Espyo	okay... I think I understand how the game decides how to spawn enemies
2016-10-15 20:33:09	@Espyo	from analysis alone, at least
2016-10-15 20:33:14	@Espyo	here's a pseudo-algorithm http://pastebin.com/wUaNpXb7
2016-10-15 20:33:20	@Espyo	don't really expect anyone to analyse it
2016-10-15 20:33:23	@Espyo	but you can just see how convoluted it is
2016-10-15 20:33:45	@Espyo	uh, indentation is messed up for "Main algorithm", w/e
2016-10-15 20:34:42	@Espyo	aaaand line 7 should be indented one step back
2016-10-15 20:34:51	Yoshi2	as a python programmer my mind threw a parsing error and could not continue reading the algorithm
2016-10-15 20:35:01	@Espyo	damn
2016-10-15 20:35:05	@Espyo	at least your mind has a try catch
2016-10-15 20:35:14	@Espyo	the catch being writing out on IRC what you just said :V
2016-10-15 20:35:45	Yoshi2	I wired stderr to an ircbot
2016-10-15 20:36:35	Yoshi2	that algorithm is conculuted indeed
2016-10-15 20:36:47	Yoshi2	*convuluted
2016-10-15 20:37:26	Yoshi2	is  {f002}  some sort of enemy limit?
2016-10-15 20:38:07	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-15 20:38:23	@Espyo	it's the number of enemies the game wants to spawn
2016-10-15 20:38:33	@Espyo	but if each enemy family says "I want exactly 3", for instance
2016-10-15 20:38:43	@Espyo	then that {f002} parameter is ignored
2016-10-15 20:38:49	@Espyo	at least, it's ignored as a minimum
2016-10-15 20:38:53	@Espyo	it's always respected as a maximum
2016-10-15 20:40:00	@Espyo	at least it looks like obstacles and plants just don't care
2016-10-15 20:40:09	@Espyo	if you say "16", the game spawns 16 and that's the end of it
2016-10-15 20:55:16	Marty2000	Espyo: I can test your glitches
2016-10-15 20:55:29	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0fGTfN8qA Just, isn't this outside the cave?
2016-10-15 21:04:25	@Espyo	yeah, it's outside
2016-10-15 21:06:33	Marty2000	There's a known way to get out of bounds
2016-10-15 21:06:45	@Espyo	does this involve going out of bounds?
2016-10-15 21:06:45	Marty2000	if that's what you were wondering
2016-10-15 21:07:00	@Espyo	shouldn't this happening if you just exit the cave normally, but switch leaders back and forth?
2016-10-15 21:07:01	Marty2000	I don't know, but it seems so to me
2016-10-15 21:07:02	@Espyo	that's my theory, is all
2016-10-15 21:07:09	Marty2000	Well, I'll try

2016-10-15 21:15:02	Marty2000	I may be wrong*
2016-10-15 21:16:43	Marty2000	I'm still trying to figure out where that OoB is...
2016-10-15 21:18:34	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-10-15 21:19:09	Marty2000	Seems like it's either located near the entrance to the cave or in the cave itself
2016-10-15 21:19:18	Marty2000	I think it's the latter
2016-10-15 21:19:40	Marty2000	because I don't know how you could get OoB for the former
2016-10-15 21:21:26	Marty2000	The place in the screenshot is dark, so I do think it's in the cave

2016-10-16 19:50:39	@Espyo	thanks
2016-10-16 19:52:22	Yoshi2	scruffy's new render, i did not enjoy it quite as much as i should've
2016-10-16 19:52:28	Yoshi2	[8:18 PM] Yoshi2: @Scary I think the shine looks weird when it suddenly becomes really bright, and the clouds at the start from before you zoom out feel blurry. Plus, the shine seems to look away from the viewer while the logo looks directly at the viewer (in the original the shine looked away too, but the title was also different: https://tcrf.net/File:MarioSunshineTitle.png )
2016-10-16 19:56:17	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-10-16 19:56:19	@Espyo	I see what you mean
2016-10-16 19:58:57	Yoshi2	i would even dare say
2016-10-16 19:59:04	Yoshi2	it looks very unity-esque

2016-10-18 19:57:44	@Espyo	uhm
2016-10-18 19:57:48	@Espyo	yesterday, while trying to sleep
2016-10-18 19:57:49	@Espyo	I remembered something
2016-10-18 19:58:01	@Espyo	if you get the bad ending in Pikmin 1 before you even discover Yellow Pikmin
2016-10-18 19:58:12	@Espyo	you'll still see Yellows and Blues on the bad ending cutscene
2016-10-18 19:58:24	@Espyo	and I was thinking of adding that to the mistakes article
2016-10-18 19:58:30	@Espyo	but now I'm not entirely sure if that is the case
2016-10-18 20:37:25	Marty2000	I think you see them during the cutscene, yeah
2016-10-18 20:37:58	Marty2000	You see 3 Red Pikmin while Olimar is trying to escape, though
2016-10-18 20:38:08	Marty2000	I think that's it... not entirely sure either
2016-10-18 20:41:29	@Espyo	drat

2016-10-18 20:43:19	@Espyo	lol
2016-10-18 20:43:31	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-10-18 20:43:37	@Espyo	you don't see Pikmin you haven't discovered
2016-10-18 20:43:37	@Espyo	neat
2016-10-18 20:44:16	@Espyo	aaaah
2016-10-18 20:44:19	@Espyo	now I know what I was thinking
2016-10-18 20:44:27	@Espyo	>Amusingly, if the player terminates their last day on the planet of the Pikmin via a Pikmin extinction in the first game, three Pikmin will still see Olimar take off on his ship, and there will still be Pikmin to take him to the Onion.
2016-10-18 20:44:38	@Espyo	I was confusing "Pikmin from types you don't have appear" with this thing ^
2016-10-18 20:44:54	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-10-18 20:46:16	@Espyo	there, all cleared up

2016-10-20 10:58:32	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2
2016-10-20 10:59:03	Marty2000	I saw somewhere that Nintendo Japan's account mentions the NX will be revealed in a 3-minute vidoe
2016-10-20 10:59:08	Marty2000	video*
2016-10-20 10:59:29	Marty2000	https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/788900045089181696

2016-10-20 15:24:06	Marty2000	Well, it seems to be a new Splatoon
2016-10-20 15:24:22	Marty2000	New gear, new weapons, and customising hairstyles
2016-10-20 15:24:32	Marty2000	which isn't possible with the current Splatoon
2016-10-20 15:34:25	Yoshi2	hm true, I have missed that
2016-10-20 15:34:33	Yoshi2	or maybe splatoon will get a hair style update :D
2016-10-20 15:41:38	Marty2000	I doubt it, but why not, everything is possible with Nintendo :D

2016-10-29 11:36:20	@Espyo	wait, is this because of the hacked account yesterday?
2016-10-29 11:36:54	Yoshi2	because this happened https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/59xdrl/if_this_post_reaches_2000_upskys_this_subreddit/
2016-10-29 11:37:18	Yoshi2	the css is taken/stolen from the mrrobot subreddit
2016-10-29 11:38:32	@Espyo	...well that's stupid
2016-10-29 11:39:39	@Espyo	wait, is the Mr. Robot binge related to "lol we were hacked u guize, we'll watch Mr. Robot to find out why"?
2016-10-29 11:39:50	@Espyo	and is the subreddit just taking a major piss at that?
2016-10-29 11:39:59	@Espyo	or is "After all, if Mr. Robot is good enough for THE Sean Murray, then why wouldn't it be good enough for us?" legit ass-kissing?
2016-10-29 11:40:34	Yoshi2	taking piss at that statement I suppose
2016-10-29 11:41:04	@Espyo	right
2016-10-29 11:41:11	Yoshi2	plus shitposting
2016-10-29 11:41:14	@Espyo	yep
2016-10-29 11:50:29	Yoshi2	they are saying that MrRobot is actually a decent show so it isn't shitposting without substance
2016-10-29 11:51:53	@Espyo	right
2016-10-29 12:22:08	Yoshi2	screw being an police men, game devloper or astronaut

2016-10-29 12:53:19	@Espyo	there's so much wrong
2016-10-29 12:53:42	@Espyo	at the start, it asks the system's language, I set it to Portuguese, and it doesn't auto-assume that I want the keyboard and all as Portuguese as well
2016-10-29 12:53:45	@Espyo	I had to set it manually
2016-10-29 12:53:47	@Espyo	cool beans
2016-10-29 12:53:54	@Espyo	on the system itself, it's half Portuguese, half English
2016-10-29 12:54:05	@Espyo	I guess the core system strings are English, and more "dynamic" stuff like apps are Portuguese
2016-10-29 12:54:09	@Espyo	but wow, it's an eyesore and a half
2016-10-29 12:54:35	@Espyo	trying to remove mcafee (pfft who uses that?)
2016-10-29 12:54:59	@Espyo	found it on the start menu
2016-10-29 12:55:02	@Espyo	right clicked, uninstall
2016-10-29 12:55:11	@Espyo	it didn't start the uninstall process

2016-10-29 12:56:15	@Espyo	that was... dumb, to say the least
2016-10-29 12:56:27	@Espyo	it's nitpicking, but wow, is it so hard to get these tiny things right?

2016-10-29 13:39:03	@Espyo	hi
2016-10-29 14:10:26	Yoshi2	hi marty
2016-10-29 15:40:30	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R60PdX3XWUg game can be corrupted in such a way that even selecting a different file won't work, but
2016-10-29 15:40:35	Yoshi2	WHAT CAUSED THE CORRUPTION
2016-10-29 15:44:12	Yoshi2	"I don't know why this happens or if it's emulator only, but it doesn't end until you restart the game." pannen you can do all this magic but you can't figure out what causes the crash
2016-10-29 15:44:18	Yoshi2	i am VERY disappointed
2016-10-29 15:47:47	Yoshi2	just dump the save data from an uncorrupted and corrupted game, can't be that hard can it
2016-10-29 15:50:03	@Espyo	lol
2016-10-29 15:50:26	Yoshi2	"I tested this on an actual console using the hat cloning glitch, and none of the graphical glitches like shadows turning into squares and disappearing HUD happened. It just got laggy and eventually crashed. ):﻿" awww
2016-10-29 15:51:31	@Espyo	yeah, emulators like to keep going past the point of crashing
2016-10-29 15:51:34	@Espyo	so you get to see all the cool stuff
2016-10-29 17:36:43	Marty2000	Tempted to add to "Names in other languages"... there are many articles that miss a few names, and even though that's not *very* important, it's still something
2016-10-29 17:39:16	@Espyo	you're free to do whatever you like

2016-10-31 15:29:57	@Espyo	so probably not
2016-10-31 16:44:14	Yoshi2	I wanted to play a game I used to play in my childhood but I can't get it to install
2016-10-31 16:44:27	Yoshi2	installer needs more than 60 MB of free space
2016-10-31 16:45:16	Yoshi2	it goes without saying that I have a multiple of that in free space on my HDD
2016-10-31 16:46:38	@Espyo	aww man, I hate that
2016-10-31 16:48:36	Yoshi2	I have no idea how to deal with that
2016-10-31 16:49:06	Yoshi2	two ways probably: Debug the installer and see when it raises the issue
2016-10-31 16:49:21	Yoshi2	or extract files directly from the thing (idk if this is possible)
2016-10-31 16:50:32	@Espyo	you'd be surprised
2016-10-31 16:50:42	@Espyo	try extracting the files from the exe using the likes of 7z
2016-10-31 16:50:47	@Espyo	as if it were a zip
2016-10-31 16:50:49	@Espyo	it just works
2016-10-31 16:52:57	Yoshi2	I am suprised that works
2016-10-31 16:53:08	Yoshi2	but most of the data is in .cab files
2016-10-31 16:57:54	Yoshi2	(installshield cab)
2016-10-31 17:02:09	@Espyo	I think you can also unzip cab files :V
2016-10-31 17:08:37	Yoshi2	I'm afraid not (or not the ones from installshield)
2016-10-31 17:09:03	Yoshi2	7z complains after a bit of trying to open the file
2016-10-31 17:09:58	@Espyo	oh
2016-10-31 17:10:04	@Espyo	but there has to be some way to extract cab files
2016-10-31 17:28:57	Yoshi2	I found a program which could probably do it
2016-10-31 17:37:50	Yoshi2	i did it, i extracted the files and it looks like a mess
2016-10-31 17:42:12	@Espyo	long story short, it's no use
2016-10-31 17:43:38	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is a way to figure out where the files go

2016-11-02 22:00:58	Yoshi2	I turned off a bunch of stuff and now it's only 4 GB
2016-11-02 22:01:16	Yoshi2	though there is a compiler and a coder that take 2 GB by themselves
2016-11-02 22:04:20	@Espyo	ee-eep
2016-11-02 22:04:24	@Espyo	a compiler with TWO GB

2016-11-04 19:00:07	Testyo	Hey everyone!
2016-11-04 19:20:04	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-11-04 19:20:04	Testyo	I was so looking foward to hearing that song...it always put me in the mood to compile
2016-11-04 19:21:04	@Espyo	hi
2016-11-04 19:22:04	Yoshi2	i have many regrets about the uncut patch for nekopara
2016-11-04 19:22:53	@Espyo	bu
2016-11-04 19:22:54	@Espyo	*t
2016-11-04 19:22:58	@Espyo	you knew what you were getting yourself into
2016-11-04 19:23:14	Yoshi2	the additional scenes weren't worth the additional 10 bucks you would've had to pay for the uncut game
2016-11-04 19:23:36	@Espyo	not uncut enough?
2016-11-04 19:24:04	Yoshi2	plenty uncut enough, but very awkward/uncomfortable to watch
2016-11-04 19:24:34	@Espyo	awkward because it's a lewd animu, or because they just handled it very poorly?
2016-11-04 19:26:56	Yoshi2	very awkward sounds (the same sound whether it's fellatio or going in for real), with really awkwardly written text (or the translation is poor in this part)
2016-11-04 19:27:21	@Espyo	wow, that IS disappointing
2016-11-04 19:27:29	@Espyo	is the vanilla game that poor?
2016-11-04 19:28:04	Yoshi2	the regular parts of the game are mostly fine, just the sex scenes are ugh
2016-11-04 19:28:13	Yoshi2	oh well, it was for science
2016-11-04 19:29:38	@Espyo	'course
2016-11-04 19:31:51	Yoshi2	it's kinda funny, one would say porn is porn but no, it's possible to have high standards even for porn
2016-11-04 19:33:47	Yoshi2	if it's bad then it might be better to not have it at all
2016-11-04 19:37:57	@Espyo	of course it is
2016-11-04 19:38:12	@Espyo	if it's a thing that's meant to cause some emotion or feeling, there are right ways and wrong ways to do it
2016-11-04 19:38:22	@Espyo	did you fail to give the audience the feeling that you were meant to? then it's bad
2016-11-04 19:38:29	@Espyo	bad comedy, bad horror, bad porn, whatever
2016-11-04 19:39:20	Yoshi2	yup, the same principles apply
2016-11-04 19:44:56	Yoshi2	I sped through the next parts of the visual novel and before I knew it the game was setting up another such scene aghhhh
2016-11-04 19:45:15	Yoshi2	not looking forward to hearing somebody suck on some sort of ice cream very loudly
2016-11-04 19:45:24	@Espyo	hehe
2016-11-04 19:45:29	@Espyo	please tell me there's a Steam page for the DLC
2016-11-04 19:45:31	@Espyo	I wanna see reviews
2016-11-04 19:46:51	Yoshi2	the dlc is not on steam (steam has a long way to go till they start hosting porn)
2016-11-04 19:47:15	Yoshi2	but there are threads about making the steam version uncut 
2016-11-04 19:47:35	Yoshi2	and I bet people made reviews about the uncut version anyway
2016-11-04 19:53:40	@Espyo	right
2016-11-04 19:53:46	@Espyo	yeah, I forgot Steam doesn't do naked
2016-11-04 19:55:02	Yoshi2	and I think I will finally record some stuff again
2016-11-04 19:55:17	Yoshi2	and change my youtube avatar when I figure out a fitting picture
2016-11-04 19:55:52	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-11-04 19:56:02	@Espyo	I just grabbed my Smash main, made him goofy
2016-11-04 19:56:05	@Espyo	done, avatar for the ages
2016-11-04 20:00:49	Yoshi2	I have an anime avatar I did some time ago and while I love anime a lot, that is probably not the best avatar for somebody who does modding stuff :P
2016-11-04 20:04:25	@Espyo	don't see why not
2016-11-04 20:04:56	Yoshi2	well, I feel more inspired by the avatar of pannen
2016-11-04 20:15:15	Yoshi2	[2:51 AM] loo: that was all scruffy and sushi
2016-11-04 20:15:15	Yoshi2	[2:53 AM] TheSneakyStuffing: and yoshi
2016-11-04 20:15:15	Yoshi2	[2:55 AM] loo: well maybe he should talk more
2016-11-04 20:15:17	Yoshi2	huh
2016-11-04 20:15:46	Yoshi2	(from the pikcast channel in the pikipedia discord)
2016-11-04 20:19:13	@Espyo	did you work on the 15th anniversary tribute video?
2016-11-04 20:19:37	Yoshi2	i don't know it existed
2016-11-04 20:20:21	Yoshi2	*didn't
2016-11-04 20:20:49	@Espyo	then I have no idea what Kevin is talking about
2016-11-04 20:20:54	@Espyo	I found it weird when I first read it, too
2016-11-04 20:20:58	@Espyo	actually, lemme ask him
2016-11-04 20:24:58	Yoshi2	I watched the video now, pretty cool
2016-11-04 20:25:04	Yoshi2	though I'm probably not the one being referred to by yoshi
2016-11-04 20:25:10	Yoshi2	(unless i am)
2016-11-04 20:50:45	@Espyo	>Oh no, I was being dumb and saying "yoshi", cause it's sounds somewhat like "sushi"
2016-11-04 20:50:47	@Espyo	mystery solved
2016-11-04 20:51:32	Yoshi2	playing with my feelings like that
2016-11-04 20:51:33	Yoshi2	how rude

2016-11-05 15:40:45	Yoshi2	there is a whole category of pandering MMD videos on youtube
2016-11-05 15:40:48	Yoshi2	and the worst is
2016-11-05 15:40:58	Yoshi2	they deliver. they actually deliver
2016-11-05 15:45:47	@Espyo	pandering MMD? like what?
2016-11-05 15:48:11	Yoshi2	some have characters in bikini or particulary lewd shots of characters in the thumbnail
2016-11-05 15:48:31	Yoshi2	and the video is usually what it says on the tin (or in this case, in the thumbnail)
2016-11-05 15:48:45	Yoshi2	haven't seen any bait&switch
2016-11-05 15:50:56	@Espyo	that's pretty risqué
2016-11-05 15:51:22	@Espyo	but, knowing youtube, those videos will stay up
2016-11-05 15:57:11	Yoshi2	I do not mind that because the alternative seems quite scary (youtube can't be trusted to police content well enough)
2016-11-05 15:58:58	@Espyo	tell me about it...
2016-11-05 15:59:31	Yoshi2	on a different topic, silvagunner is uploading videos again, what is this sorcery
2016-11-05 16:05:27	@Espyo	yeah, I don't even know any more
2016-11-05 16:05:36	@Espyo	how can I mourn in peace when it just keeps coming back?

2016-11-05 16:07:56	Yoshi2	and on the topic of why there are so many weird japanese videos on youtube, I've registered a niconicodouga account to watch videos on niconico and niconico is inferior to youtube (however this is even possible) with worse player, worse quality (niconico doesn't even know what HD quality is I think)
2016-11-05 16:08:25	@Espyo	that
2016-11-05 16:08:29	@Espyo	is pretty hard to believe
2016-11-05 16:08:33	@Espyo	it's gotta be a Japanese thing
2016-11-05 16:08:54	@Espyo	like "videos must be played with inferior quality, because the shrine of the large-testicled video racoon says that humans don't deserve high quality video output"
2016-11-05 16:09:18	Yoshi2	and I think you have to pay to get some better features on niconico
2016-11-05 16:09:27	@Espyo	ugh
2016-11-05 16:09:31	@Espyo	youtube red before youtube red

2016-11-05 18:03:46	@Espyo	man, I just skipped ahead
2016-11-05 18:03:49	@Espyo	it was 2spook4me
2016-11-05 18:03:55	@Espyo	also too nonsense for me
2016-11-05 18:04:05	@Espyo	either way, I just left with more questions than answers
2016-11-05 18:04:17	Yoshi2	I thought the music fit the dance very well

2016-11-05 19:31:06	@Espyo	why not use the native getElementsByClassName?
2016-11-05 20:03:12	@Espyo	turns out the old way we had of hooking functions to the document's load event wasn't working

2016-11-07 19:04:52	Yoshi2	in some ways I liked the BW1 campaign more than BW2 because BW2 tried to make a lot more things happen with its global conflict
2016-11-07 19:05:30	Yoshi2	resulting in the mini campaigns for each country being small
2016-11-07 19:08:32	@Espyo	oh, I can imagine that

2016-11-07 20:02:55	Yoshi2	I don't have a case for it though so I will have to throw it in somewhere (probably in the 2.5" spot that is empty in my pc's case
2016-11-07 20:11:39	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-11-07 20:19:47	Yoshi2	now do i plug in the ssd to check for any software that is on it or do i just screw it and install win10 on it 
2016-11-07 20:23:36	@Espyo	it's gotta have some nude photos

2016-11-07 20:23:52	Yoshi2	god now you made curious
2016-11-07 20:24:37	Yoshi2	if there is some emma watson stuff on it (or who is the celebrity nowadays people make fakes for because they don't have actual nudes)
2016-11-07 20:24:55	@J	I was thinking of getting an SSD just because, don't think I've used one before
2016-11-07 20:25:06	@Espyo	you know it
2016-11-07 20:25:13	@Espyo	they're kind of expensive though, aren't they?
2016-11-07 20:25:25	Yoshi2	I'm using one in my notebook and I am very happy with it
2016-11-07 20:25:27	@J	meh, I hardly spend my money
2016-11-07 20:25:55	@J	I would only get a small one anyway
2016-11-07 20:25:58	Yoshi2	my 250 GB one was 90€ and that's on the more expensive end because samsung
2016-11-07 20:25:59	Testyo	90 € = £ 63.594  / $ 97.848 
2016-11-07 20:26:17	@J	can you link it, out of interest?
2016-11-07 20:26:59	@J	also do you know what connector they use, will I just be able to install it alongside my HDD?
2016-11-07 20:27:14	Yoshi2	https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-750-EVO-2-5-Inch-MZ-750250BW/dp/B01AAKZRP2
2016-11-07 20:27:53	@Espyo	woah
2016-11-07 20:27:54	Yoshi2	sata3 but that is backwards compatible with sata2 (same shape I'm sure)
2016-11-07 20:28:00	@J	hey look at that, the UK price is hardly above the US price (£71)
2016-11-07 20:28:06	@J	Testyo no convert?
2016-11-07 20:28:07	Testyo	I DON'T PLAY SMASH IN 5 THEN?
2016-11-07 20:28:10	@J	£71
2016-11-07 20:28:11	Testyo	£ 71 = 100.479 € / $ 109.241 
2016-11-07 20:28:13	@J	thanks
2016-11-07 20:28:48	@J	okay, I think I have SATA 3 anyway
2016-11-07 20:29:21	@J	if it's smaller do you need something to house it to keep it from moving around or something?
2016-11-07 20:29:53	Yoshi2	a 2.5"->3.5" case, yes
2016-11-07 20:30:07	@J	oh, it's just laptop size?
2016-11-07 20:30:23	Yoshi2	yup, the SSDs are almost always 2.5"
2016-11-07 20:30:32	@J	ah, you made it sound even smaller
2016-11-07 20:31:04	@J	are you using it in a laptop?
2016-11-07 20:31:32	Yoshi2	nope
2016-11-07 20:32:19	Yoshi2	bought one for my pc so I can also install a new OS on it
2016-11-07 20:32:23	@J	...link the other thing you got then? /lazy
2016-11-07 20:32:49	Yoshi2	i don't have the case thing :I 
2016-11-07 20:33:42	@J	oh, you didn't realise you needed one?
2016-11-07 20:34:02	Yoshi2	I did, but the store I went to didn#t have it
2016-11-07 20:34:13	@J	ah, okay
2016-11-07 20:34:22	Yoshi2	the thing isn't special though https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mounting-Bracket-drive-CSSD-BRKT1/dp/B0090UG55A
2016-11-07 20:34:45	Yoshi2	7 bucks is probably too much for what it is :P
2016-11-07 20:35:24	Yoshi2	ssds should have holes on the sides or bottom for screwing screws in
2016-11-07 20:35:26	Yoshi2	mine does
2016-11-07 20:38:00	@Espyo	(£71)
2016-11-07 20:38:02	@Espyo	huh
2016-11-07 20:38:07	@Espyo	guess Testyo doesn't like parentheses
2016-11-07 20:38:07	Testyo	for some reason, these past 2 days have to watch that again
2016-11-07 20:42:21	Yoshi2	I might not need the case thing, my pc has a similary shaped case that houses the memory card readers into which I can drop the ssd, nice
2016-11-07 20:43:52	Yoshi2	alriiight let's start this
2016-11-07 20:51:38	Yoshi2	hmmm I have to unplug my dvd drive to have my hdds and the ssd connected
2016-11-07 20:51:39	Yoshi2	well
2016-11-07 20:51:44	Yoshi2	nothing of value lost :D
2016-11-07 20:52:36	@Espyo	...oh yeah, that's a thing
2016-11-07 20:52:42	@Espyo	heh, my laptop doesn't even have a DVD drive
2016-11-07 20:52:44	@Espyo	it comes separate
2016-11-07 20:52:47	@Espyo	I have to plug it with USB
2016-11-07 20:53:10	@J	I figure if I hid something in my DVD drive no-one would ever find it
2016-11-07 20:54:05	@Espyo	yep
2016-11-07 20:54:29	Yoshi2	zzz espyo you liar
2016-11-07 20:54:35	Yoshi2	there are no nudes
2016-11-07 20:54:43	Yoshi2	in fact, it appears to be unallocated, sweet
2016-11-07 20:54:54	@Espyo	oh, well then
2016-11-07 20:55:01	@Espyo	meaning it definitely DID have nudes
2016-11-07 20:55:06	@Espyo	otherwise nobody would've bothered to wipe it
2016-11-07 20:55:07	@Espyo	probably
2016-11-07 20:55:23	Yoshi2	:o
2016-11-07 20:55:35	Yoshi2	TIME FOR DD RESCUE
2016-11-07 21:08:14	Yoshi2	I wonder if I unplugged some cable by accident because all my USB ports are REALLY slow
2016-11-07 21:08:54	@J	here it starts
2016-11-07 21:13:11	Yoshi2	>blue screen
2016-11-07 21:13:17	Yoshi2	i didnt even finish installing
2016-11-07 21:14:29	@Espyo	ah, windows
2016-11-07 21:24:48	Yoshi2	windows dont you fucking dare fail on me
2016-11-07 21:43:44	@Espyo	huh
2016-11-07 21:43:49	@Espyo	The Big Picture was on
2016-11-07 21:44:12	@Espyo	the question was for the guest to answer for a picture of an SSD

2016-11-10 19:03:06	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-11-10 19:03:07	Testyo	This is what I THINK I've seen my boss browse through that page some weeks ago
2016-11-10 19:03:28	Yoshi2	we didn't talk about the election yesterday
2016-11-10 19:09:01	@Espyo	hi
2016-11-10 19:09:03	@Espyo	yeah, we didn't
2016-11-10 19:09:14	@Espyo	this joke has gone on for a bit too long
2016-11-10 19:09:23	@Espyo	though I'm sure they'll admit it was all a big prank by February
2016-11-10 19:10:33	Yoshi2	it was just a prank bro
2016-11-10 19:10:36	Yoshi2	a clinton plant
2016-11-10 19:14:57	@Espyo	yep
2016-11-10 19:14:59	@Espyo	though to be honest
2016-11-10 19:15:16	@Espyo	apparently his speech was much more level-headed instead of him being a massive meme as usual
2016-11-10 19:15:31	@Espyo	and apparently some of the nasty things he said he'd do are being silently denied
2016-11-10 19:15:50	@Espyo	like his official website said he'd export all Arabs or something, during the elections, but that's been removed some hours ago
2016-11-10 19:16:00	@Espyo	is it possible that this is actually a ruse and he'll be a good president?
2016-11-10 19:28:56	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpKoAwU8lrc
2016-11-10 20:01:53	Yoshi2	there is something hysterical about a guy being called "psych0milf"
2016-11-10 20:03:32	Yoshi2	also shoutouts to simpleflips
2016-11-10 20:06:25	@Espyo	hehe yeah

2016-11-12 13:24:08	Yoshi2	there is something that I wanted to say but I forgot what it was, hnnnggg
2016-11-12 13:24:57	@Espyo	love that
2016-11-12 13:25:49	Yoshi2	the issue with that is that it was something I thought about after I woke up
2016-11-12 13:25:57	Yoshi2	but that was 5-6 hours ago
2016-11-12 13:26:10	@Espyo	that's why I point down everything I realize I have to do later
2016-11-12 13:26:16	@Espyo	so I never forget
2016-11-12 13:26:22	@Espyo	...except when I forget to actually point it down
2016-11-12 13:27:47	Yoshi2	today I finally got to play civ6 with a friend of mine and we randomed the leaders
2016-11-12 13:28:03	Yoshi2	last time we tried to do it I got russia, this time I got america
2016-11-12 13:28:08	Yoshi2	such coincidence
2016-11-12 13:28:33	@Espyo	it's clearly a sign
2016-11-12 13:28:37	@Espyo	what'd he get?
2016-11-12 13:28:41	@Espyo	or she
2016-11-12 13:30:27	Yoshi2	first time he got arabia, this time spain
2016-11-12 13:32:54	@Espyo	Spain is very similar to Mexico
2016-11-12 13:32:57	@Espyo	at least in language
2016-11-12 13:33:00	@Espyo	so...you know what to do
2016-11-12 13:35:48	Yoshi2	construct an object of great height and length and cause the state to become exceptional?
2016-11-12 13:35:58	@Espyo	indeed

2016-11-12 13:42:49	Yoshi2	https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/5ci724/innes_mckendrick_is_going_to_be_speaking_about/ i am honestly curious what they could give a talk about
2016-11-12 13:45:01	@Espyo	oh dear
2016-11-12 13:45:24	@Espyo	he'll probably be forced to speak JUST about the proc gen algorithm
2016-11-12 13:45:28	@Espyo	and completely ignore any question that is not that
2016-11-12 13:45:31	@Espyo	he? she?
2016-11-12 13:45:37	@Espyo	is Innes female?
2016-11-12 13:45:43	@Espyo	Inês is a Portuguese female name
2016-11-12 13:45:53	@Espyo	I've seen Innes in Fire Emblem too, as a name only
2016-11-12 13:46:23	@Espyo	http://fireemblemwiki.org/w/images/c/c4/FESS_Innes.png an androgynous guy
2016-11-12 13:46:40	Yoshi2	I forgot the exact details but iirc Innes underwent a gender change or whatever
2016-11-12 13:47:14	@Espyo	what, in Fire Emblem?
2016-11-12 13:48:34	Yoshi2	the NMS one
2016-11-12 13:49:13	@Espyo	ah
2016-11-12 13:49:22	@Espyo	maybe it's just a genderless name?
2016-11-12 13:49:24	@Espyo	I don't even know
2016-11-12 13:49:27	@Espyo	but either way, this has to be good

2016-11-12 14:03:28	Yoshi2	I would genuinely be interested in hearing about what the dev has to say
2016-11-12 14:11:06	Yoshi2	sony says this, sony says that
2016-11-12 14:11:24	Yoshi2	I actually wonder if maybe Hello Games is only a shell of its former self
2016-11-12 14:11:34	Yoshi2	and sony put some of their own people in to do development

2016-11-13 14:47:24	Yoshi2	"Australian soldiers in WW2 "fought for fascism, not for freedom"" i love /r/ShitWehraboosSay
2016-11-13 14:47:39	@Espyo	...huh
2016-11-13 14:47:48	Yoshi2	it's like looking at crazy conspiracy theorists except much less sad
2016-11-13 14:49:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-11-13 14:52:21	Yoshi2	and if it wasn't for that sub, I would've never found out that a lot of what is commonly talked about (US Shermans were bad tanks, Soviet Union only won by throwing waves of soldiers at the germans) is nothing more than myths
2016-11-13 14:58:33	Yoshi2	also big myth: the german late war heavy tanks were a great idea and germany should've built more of them
2016-11-13 14:59:01	@Espyo	hm
2016-11-13 15:03:59	Yoshi2	the only positive aspect is that those heavy tanks look very impressive

2016-11-15 21:38:38	Miles	At least I finally bothered to do a run with Hive Dash after, like, 5 years
2016-11-15 21:38:47	@Espyo	heh
2016-11-15 21:38:57	@Espyo	yikes, 5 years is actually a time frame you can say in this context
2016-11-15 21:39:11	@Espyo	it's insane to think about how long the Metroid Prime series speedrunning scene has been going for
2016-11-15 21:39:12	Miles	Echoes came out 12 years ago today!
2016-11-15 21:39:17	@Espyo	oh sick!
2016-11-15 21:39:23	@Espyo	and exactly 0 people announced it bar you
2016-11-15 21:39:24	@Espyo	sad
2016-11-15 21:39:31	@Espyo	well, at least 0 that I noticed
2016-11-15 21:39:51	@Espyo	wait, lemme check twitter...
2016-11-15 21:39:58	Yoshi2	still more than those who have announced battalion war's bday
2016-11-15 21:40:16	Miles	Speaking of which did you see my, um, personal announcement from last week >_>
2016-11-15 21:40:55	Yoshi2	i don't think I saw the personal announcement
2016-11-15 21:41:07	Yoshi2	wonder if I have it in my logs
2016-11-15 21:41:15	Miles	On Twitter I meant
2016-11-15 21:41:56	Yoshi2	oh
2016-11-15 21:42:11	 *	Yoshi2 doesn't check twitter
2016-11-15 21:43:43	Yoshi2	i shall do it now
2016-11-15 21:44:07	Miles	I'll save you the trouble and just say I came out as trans
2016-11-15 21:44:09	@Espyo	I have
2016-11-15 21:44:12	@Espyo	you do you, yo
2016-11-15 21:44:24	@Espyo	as long as you do what makes you happy, and nobody else is hurt in the process, and that last part is important
2016-11-15 21:44:27	@Espyo	then what you're doing is correct
2016-11-15 21:44:28	@Espyo	end of story
2016-11-15 21:44:38	@Espyo	oh, and that "nobody else is hurt in the process" includes yourself
2016-11-15 21:44:46	@Espyo	since you finding your identity matches that description
2016-11-15 21:44:55	@Espyo	then hell yeah you're not doing anything wrong
2016-11-15 21:44:59	@Espyo	but hey, you know how the world is
2016-11-15 21:45:06	@Espyo	don't let it get you down
2016-11-15 21:50:53	Yoshi2	it suprised me some, but yeah ^ agreed
2016-11-15 21:51:36	Yoshi2	also "To be honest I'm quickly finding people's "DID YOU JUST ASSUME GENDER" jokes unfunny and annoying" oh yes i agree
2016-11-15 21:52:39	Yoshi2	i've had a person do it to me once or twice and i'm not even trans
2016-11-15 21:53:42	@Espyo	heh
2016-11-15 21:53:51	@Espyo	I read that, and my first thought was "...and this is surprising HOW?"
2016-11-15 21:53:55	@Espyo	I mean, it's twitter
2016-11-15 21:54:02	@Espyo	of COURSE it runs on memes
2016-11-15 21:54:26	Yoshi2	in my case it happened on irc, so it was more confusing
2016-11-15 21:54:54	@Espyo	huh
2016-11-15 21:56:56	Yoshi2	(it was also a person I've talked with for a while. Maybe they were confused by my humor, don't see any other reason for why that happened)

2016-11-17 21:44:01	@Espyo	that I don't know
2016-11-17 21:44:47	Yoshi2	it was from a mashup I think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b0CPerywqU (guess who's back at 10 seconds, with a brand new rap at 25 seconds)
2016-11-17 21:45:49	Yoshi2	(that mashup was for the longest time my main exposure to eminem because the other stuff was GEMA blocked :'D)
2016-11-17 21:47:39	@Espyo	ah GEMA
2016-11-17 21:47:46	@Espyo	aren't they dead now?
2016-11-17 21:48:16	Yoshi2	i wish but nah
2016-11-17 21:48:31	Yoshi2	they did come to an agreement with youtube so stuff isn't blocked in germany so much anymore

2016-11-20 13:02:22	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-11-20 13:02:23	Testyo	I think that icon was a 5 page paper thats due next Tuesday so I'm trying to get it done before Friday
2016-11-20 13:02:59	@Espyo	hi
2016-11-20 13:03:54	Yoshi2	you are laaaaate, even for sleeping 12 hours :P
2016-11-20 13:07:21	@Espyo	still should've slept more
2016-11-20 13:33:09	Yoshi2	Espyo J : do you know any xml editor with filtering options?
2016-11-20 13:35:23	@Espyo	not really
2016-11-20 13:35:30	@Espyo	if I ever need to edit an XML file, I just use Notepad++
2016-11-20 13:36:07	Yoshi2	battalion wars has 3.5 mb xml files and notepad++ ain't cutting it
2016-11-20 13:36:43	Yoshi2	looking at xml editors and I found one better than notepad++ but no filtering options (like only showing nodes with specific attributes)
2016-11-20 13:37:40	@Espyo	yikes
2016-11-20 13:37:51	@Espyo	though you can probably just regex that
2016-11-20 13:39:31	Yoshi2	that isn't really filtering though
2016-11-20 13:39:34	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-11-20 13:39:35	Testyo	navbox type and years for Pikmin to find a path in-game
2016-11-20 13:39:41	@Espyo	hi
2016-11-20 13:40:00	@Espyo	you can do anything with regex
2016-11-20 13:40:00	@Espyo	anything.
2016-11-20 13:41:20	Yoshi2	regex is for matching stuff though, it isn't turing complete
2016-11-20 13:41:32	@Espyo	anything.
2016-11-20 13:41:38	Yoshi2	in notepad++ i can type in a regex for searching but it's just that, searching
2016-11-20 13:41:44	@Espyo	you can use regex to create a regex that is turing complete, if needed
2016-11-20 13:42:03	@Espyo	but if you use search and replace, and you remove all elements that DON'T match what you want
2016-11-20 13:42:06	@Espyo	now you've got filtering
2016-11-20 13:42:25	Yoshi2	but then i can't save the file because the stuff is literally gone
2016-11-20 13:42:33	@Espyo	keep multiple files!
2016-11-20 13:42:39	@Espyo	nah, but seriously, you should spend your time searching for a program
2016-11-20 13:42:42	@Espyo	there has to be something out there
2016-11-20 13:43:46	@Espyo	...
2016-11-20 13:43:49	@Espyo	or you can make your own
2016-11-20 13:43:50	@Espyo	hmm
2016-11-20 13:45:19	Yoshi2	one I found that claimed to have filtering was commercial
2016-11-20 13:45:36	Yoshi2	I could roll my own but i would like to avoid that

2016-11-20 14:26:23	@J	never really had to edit XML myself
2016-11-20 14:26:34	@J	so no idea
2016-11-20 14:27:24	@J	if there's a specific task you need to do a lot, of course I recommend writing a script

2016-11-27 16:15:13	Yoshi2	no man's sky is actually getting an update, wow
2016-11-27 16:16:39	@Espyo	wasn't that rumoured for a few months?
2016-11-27 16:17:22	Yoshi2	yes
2016-11-27 16:17:31	Yoshi2	but now they officially showed a video of it
2016-11-27 16:17:36	@Espyo	harr
2016-11-27 16:17:38	@Espyo	this oughta be good
2016-11-27 16:17:41	@Espyo	so, what's up?
2016-11-27 16:33:17	Yoshi2	Espyo: base building and some more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI9PvjJJijY
2016-11-27 16:40:31	@Espyo	it actually looks neat... but it's still multiplayerless and all
2016-11-27 16:40:39	@Espyo	though the base building interface looks incredibly delicious
2016-11-27 16:51:53	Yoshi2	the multiplayer probably ain't happening
2016-11-27 16:52:06	Yoshi2	but I'd be happy enough if they just addressed that
2016-11-27 16:53:41	@Espyo	mhm
2016-11-27 16:53:54	@Espyo	if they just revealed that they're lying scumbags and lowered the price because of it, it could be redeemed

2016-11-27 20:04:18	Yoshi2	oh wow, some of the new animations in neptunia VII are quite risky
2016-11-27 20:07:06	Testyo	abit space when you can't use space
2016-11-27 20:07:19	@Espyo	I'm sure that's not related, Testyo
2016-11-27 20:07:19	Testyo	Well Gavin refuses to do ranked until they fix it all the same thing, over and over?
2016-11-27 20:07:32	@Espyo	dangerously close to DLC territory, eg?
2016-11-27 20:07:33	@Espyo	*eh?
2016-11-27 20:08:49	Yoshi2	Espyo: lm
2016-11-27 20:08:53	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2016-11-27 20:08:53	Testyo	I said Well Gavin refuses to do ranked until they fix it all the same thing, over and over? because Espyo mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages isn't it all the same thing, over and over? and Well Gavin refuses to do ranked until they fix it. They were joined by the common word it.
2016-11-27 20:14:04	Yoshi2	all in all, a worthy sequel to the nep games with new animations, new/different character portraits, actually new levels which have a more complex layout than just "run from here to the end", and new gameplay elements

2016-11-27 20:14:48	@Espyo	nice
2016-11-27 20:20:45	Yoshi2	mana for special skills doesn't seem to regenerate at all so no more skill spamming. But there are now formation skills which can be executed when your characters stand in a formation around the enemy (e.g. a triangle) and use a separate gauge that fills up easily through hitting
2016-11-27 20:21:03	@Espyo	oh, neat
2016-11-27 20:22:00	Yoshi2	so there is a point to moving around instead of just standing in the same spot
2016-11-27 20:23:15	Yoshi2	it helps that neptunia vii is actually a new development. I heard the Rebirth games were made from an earlier, original third game on the PS3
2016-11-27 20:26:52	Yoshi2	(there were three original games on the PS3 with issues. So the Rebirth remakes happened for the PSVita and later ported to PC)

2016-12-01 12:45:18	Testyo	I just did an inspirational FLE
2016-12-01 12:45:30	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-01 12:47:24	Yoshi2	I saw a bot have a christmas themed avatar so I decided to make a christmas avatar for myself too
2016-12-01 12:47:51	@Espyo	ah yes, the christmas avatar trend
2016-12-01 12:47:56	@Espyo	eh, I can't be bothered to change mine
2016-12-01 12:47:59	@Espyo	let's see how yours is...
2016-12-01 12:48:14	@Espyo	that looks really good
2016-12-01 12:49:15	Yoshi2	i googled christmas hat, copied it onto my avatar and called it a day
2016-12-01 12:50:29	@Espyo	hey, if it works...
2016-12-01 13:01:08	Yoshi2	I'm talking about how easy it is to make it christmas themed :P

2016-12-01 18:17:37	@Espyo	ok, to avoid having to go on windows every time I want to compile the engine, I'm gonna try cross-compilation
2016-12-01 18:17:43	@Espyo	either this is going to be the best thing in my life
2016-12-01 18:17:46	@Espyo	or a horrible way to commit suicide
2016-12-01 18:27:26	@Espyo	...what do you MEAN it JUST WORKED?
2016-12-01 18:27:30	@Espyo	THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
2016-12-01 18:27:39	@Espyo	it's supposed to throw several errors, require several dependencies, and in the end, not work at all!
2016-12-01 18:27:44	@Espyo	well, this was just a hello world
2016-12-01 18:27:52	@Espyo	I'm sure that if I try to compile the engine, it will fail horribly
2016-12-01 19:06:11	@Espyo	there we go
2016-12-01 19:06:13	@Espyo	now we're cooking
2016-12-01 19:06:18	@Espyo	compiling hello world is easy
2016-12-01 19:06:24	@Espyo	compiling an Allegro project is nigh-impossible
2016-12-01 19:07:02	Yoshi2	tfw it is easier to compile a linux program on windows than vice versa

2016-12-01 19:13:12	@Espyo	I-I'm sure that if it was running Allegro too, that it wouldn't be easy at all
2016-12-01 19:13:28	@Espyo	right, I could also just install a virtual machine so I don't have to swap computers
2016-12-01 19:13:34	@Espyo	but apparently everything is wrong, everywhere
2016-12-01 19:14:15	@Espyo	the only virtual machine I managed to get running is that crappy windows microsoft distributed for testing stuff or whatever
2016-12-01 19:14:21	@Espyo	I STILL don't understand what that is
2016-12-01 19:14:27	@Espyo	but it expires after 3 months
2016-12-01 19:14:38	@Espyo	...and is also apparently so broken that the VM can't even run any more
2016-12-01 19:17:32	Yoshi2	why not vmware/virtualbox
2016-12-01 19:17:56	@Espyo	I was using VirtualBox

2016-12-01 20:27:38	Yoshi2	ah
2016-12-01 20:27:43	@Espyo	but I don't think it's a trial
2016-12-01 20:27:48	@Espyo	hang on, lemme see if I can find the download
2016-12-01 20:28:00	Yoshi2	there is a win10 testing thingy going on that expires after some time but updates renew the expiration date

2016-12-01 20:28:22	@Espyo	that's... stupid
2016-12-01 20:29:16	Yoshi2	it's less stupid for people who want a free windows because apparently that testing thingy doesn't require a key because it is tied to your windows live account

2016-12-01 22:13:54	@Espyo	Yoshi2?
2016-12-01 22:14:03	@Espyo	can you find something immediately stupid in this Python code?
2016-12-01 22:14:04	@Espyo	for s in xrange(len(sublevels[0])) :
2016-12-01 22:14:04	@Espyo	        for f in xrange(len(input_files)) :
2016-12-01 22:14:04	@Espyo	            for f2 in range(f, len(input_files)) :
2016-12-01 22:14:04	@Espyo	                if sublevels[f][s] != sublevels[f2][s] :
2016-12-01 22:14:04	@Espyo	                    print("Difference found -- sublevel " + s + " -- " + versions[f] + " vs " + versions[f2])
2016-12-01 22:14:26	@Espyo	I'm at a bit of a loss, since I'm getting a list index out of range warning on the second to last line
2016-12-01 22:14:34	@Espyo	and as far as I know, that shouldn't be happening
2016-12-01 22:14:47	@Espyo	but I'm very confused between all of the range() and xrange() and whatnots
2016-12-01 22:15:18	@Espyo	if you can find something right away, that's just me being a beginner at Python and I'll fix it
2016-12-01 22:15:26	@Espyo	if not, it's something with my algorithm, and I have to go fix it
2016-12-01 22:15:44	Yoshi2	i guess you are using python 2
2016-12-01 22:15:47	@Espyo	(this script is meant to read all versions of all caves in the game and report differences)
2016-12-01 22:15:49	@Espyo	I am
2016-12-01 22:16:29	Yoshi2	in python 2 the difference between xrange and range is that range creates a list containing the entire range of numbers at once, while xrange is just a iterator/generator
2016-12-01 22:16:41	@Espyo	ah
2016-12-01 22:16:42	@Espyo	yikes
2016-12-01 22:16:48	Yoshi2	in python 3 the old range is gone and xrange became range
2016-12-01 22:17:02	@Espyo	smart move
2016-12-01 22:18:57	Yoshi2	Espyo: i think the issue is you are assuming len(sublevels) >= len(input_files)
2016-12-01 22:19:05	Yoshi2	which might not be necessarily true
2016-12-01 22:19:24	@Espyo	I guess
2016-12-01 22:19:28	@Espyo	although it should be true
2016-12-01 22:19:40	@Espyo	for every input_file, it appends one element to the sublevels list
2016-12-01 22:19:49	Yoshi2	you could print out the indices and see when it messes up
2016-12-01 22:20:29	@Espyo	yeah, I did
2016-12-01 22:20:32	@Espyo	I guess I'll take it from here
2016-12-01 22:20:43	@Espyo	it stops being me being bad at Python and just becomes me having messed up the algorithm
2016-12-01 22:20:46	@Espyo	thanks for the help
2016-12-01 22:21:51	Yoshi2	np
2016-12-01 22:27:35	@Espyo	range(f, len(input_files)) IS meant to go from f to len(input_files), right?
2016-12-01 22:27:49	@Espyo	it's not going from 0 to f and then just throwing away my len(input_files) parameter, is it?
2016-12-01 22:31:09	Yoshi2	from f to len(input_files), yes
2016-12-01 22:31:28	Yoshi2	range(end) or range(start, end) or range(start, end, step)
2016-12-01 22:32:02	@Espyo	all right
2016-12-01 22:32:03	@Espyo	thanks
2016-12-01 22:32:14	@Espyo	... abc += 1 works, right?
2016-12-01 22:32:17	@Espyo	increments 1 to abc
2016-12-01 22:32:30	@Espyo	yes, it does
2016-12-01 22:32:35	@Espyo	I just did the if wrong
2016-12-01 22:32:36	@Espyo	never mind
2016-12-01 22:32:45	@Espyo	ok, I reworked my code
2016-12-01 22:32:52	@Espyo	even implemented classes so this isn't a mess
2016-12-01 22:32:54	@Espyo	and it's the same error
2016-12-01 22:32:55	@Espyo	...
2016-12-01 22:32:57	@Espyo	which can only mean
2016-12-01 22:33:05	@Espyo	one of the game's versions has less sublevels in its cave
2016-12-01 22:33:08	@Espyo	...that's impossible
2016-12-01 22:33:50	@Espyo	oh, duh
2016-12-01 22:34:14	@Espyo	I specifically added checks for when one version is unavailable (I can't find any Wii JP ISO), but forgot to add it here
2016-12-01 22:34:50	@Espyo	there we go, all good now

2016-12-01 22:55:38	@Espyo	...huh, never noticed
2016-12-01 22:55:40	@Espyo	no info, no
2016-12-01 22:55:49	@Espyo	if you can figure it out, [[Menu]] is the place to put it in

2016-12-01 22:56:01	@Espyo	oh, that would make sense

2016-12-01 22:56:06	@Espyo	the color of Pikmin you last unlocked

2016-12-01 22:56:35	Marty2000	the color seems random, but I just feel like it depends on the player's actions :P
2016-12-01 22:56:51	@Espyo	yeah, I've got two saves after all Pikmin, first is white, third is purple (second is empty)

2016-12-01 22:59:07	@Espyo	oh WOW
2016-12-01 22:59:11	@Espyo	how are my save files so similar?!
2016-12-01 22:59:23	@Espyo	I don't think I ported from one version to the other... because I don't think that's possible
2016-12-01 23:00:09	Marty2000	Hmmm, I've unlocked only Red Pikmin, used hacks to play with White Pikmin, I ended the day with 95 White Pikmin (following me) and the slot is white now
2016-12-01 23:00:14	Marty2000	I see
2016-12-01 23:00:32	@Espyo	huh
2016-12-01 23:00:37	@Espyo	so, the largest number of Pikmin you have?
2016-12-01 23:00:56	@Espyo	ok, I definitely do not have whites as my leader on this save
2016-12-01 23:01:24	@Espyo	same for the "purple" file
2016-12-01 23:01:29	@Espyo	lemme check the Japanese files
2016-12-01 23:01:50	Marty2000	Okay. Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out what causes the colour to change
2016-12-01 23:01:51	@Espyo	 45 white - 12 purple - 11 purple
2016-12-01 23:02:00	@Espyo	...why are these saves so consistent
2016-12-01 23:02:07	@Espyo	well, I DID download them off of GameFAQs, but
2016-12-01 23:02:14	@Espyo	ok, now to check the NPC games
2016-12-01 23:02:30	@Espyo	 27 white - empty - empty
2016-12-01 23:02:47	@Espyo	 26 purple - empty - 5 red
2016-12-01 23:02:48	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-12-01 23:02:51	@Espyo	that's all I've got
2016-12-01 23:06:58	Marty2000	Okay. I've just unlocked Yellow Pikmin ( I have 5 of them), and ended the day with them and 95 new White Pikmin. Look at what my save file looks like now:

2016-12-01 23:07:04	Marty2000	Weird
2016-12-01 23:07:49	Marty2000	Note that I'm using hacks, and so even though I can control White Pikmin, I haven't unlocked them
2016-12-01 23:07:52	Marty2000	(theoretically)
2016-12-01 23:08:59	Marty2000	Just ended the day, the color didn't change
2016-12-01 23:10:55	Marty2000	Landed in another area and ended the day, the color didn't change either
2016-12-01 23:11:27	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-12-01 23:13:22	Marty2000	Ended the day with 95 new White Pikmin, the color is still the same. Maybe the color changes when you unlock a new type, or maybe it changes depending on what Pikmin you play with. But it likely isn't random
2016-12-01 23:17:54	Marty2000	Ended the day with 95 new White Pikmin and 2 new Yellow Pikmin: color didn't change

2016-12-01 23:18:57	Marty2000	Could also be based on which type of Pikmin got the most new members...
2016-12-01 23:23:00	@Espyo	that's pretty specific
2016-12-01 23:23:06	@Espyo	but since it's Pikmin 2, I'm willing to believe anything
2016-12-01 23:24:07	Marty2000	Ended the day with 2 new Yellow Pikmni, the color didn't change. What if I unlock a new type?
2016-12-01 23:24:28	Marty2000	Yeah, the impossible is possible with Pikmin 2 :P
2016-12-01 23:24:39	Marty2000	Pikmin*
2016-12-01 23:28:09	Marty2000	Unlocked Blue Pikmin and ended the day with 5 new Blue Pikmin.
2016-12-01 23:28:13	Marty2000	Color did change a bit:
2016-12-01 23:28:16	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/48/1480634870-111.png
2016-12-01 23:28:23	Marty2000	It's Blue
2016-12-01 23:30:13	@Espyo	greenish :X
2016-12-01 23:30:27	@Espyo	also why are you putting circles?
2016-12-01 23:31:09	Marty2000	Because the center is blue, not green
2016-12-01 23:31:22	Marty2000	well, maybe a little whitish
2016-12-01 23:31:30	Marty2000	but it's still different from my last screenshot
2016-12-01 23:31:40	Marty2000	where it was red / brownish
2016-12-01 23:32:56	@Espyo	oh, I see!
2016-12-01 23:33:01	@Espyo	yeesh, this is complex
2016-12-01 23:33:10	Marty2000	Entering a cave changed the color of the center
2016-12-01 23:33:13	Marty2000	Wait
2016-12-01 23:33:18	Marty2000	taking a screenshot
2016-12-01 23:33:23	Marty2000	indeed, heh

2016-12-01 23:33:58	Marty2000	It really is green this time
2016-12-01 23:34:05	@Espyo	I see
2016-12-01 23:34:24	Marty2000	I entered a cave and discovered Ivory Candypop Buds for the first time
2016-12-01 23:34:33	@Espyo	wait...

2016-12-01 23:35:07	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/S.S._Dolphin#Stages_of_the_Dolphin
2016-12-01 23:35:08	@Espyo	this, actually
2016-12-01 23:35:13	Marty2000	Actually, forget the Ivory Candypop Bud part
2016-12-01 23:35:24	@Espyo	on day 1, the lights are off
2016-12-01 23:35:35	@Espyo	after the Main Engine, the lights are red
2016-12-01 23:35:38	@Espyo	later they're yellow
2016-12-01 23:35:45	@Espyo	then green, then blue, then purple
2016-12-01 23:35:47	@Espyo	!
2016-12-01 23:35:53	@Espyo	this matches up with what we've been seeing!
2016-12-01 23:35:58	@Espyo	oh, but... where does white fit?
2016-12-01 23:36:04	Marty2000	Oh, neat
2016-12-01 23:36:18	@Espyo	still, early days are red, we do see green at some point afterwards, late-game saves are purple
2016-12-01 23:36:23	@Espyo	so there must be a relation
2016-12-01 23:38:31	Marty2000	Got out of the cave after discovering the first Ivory Candypop Buds, the color did change again
2016-12-01 23:38:54	Marty2000	The center is blue again
2016-12-01 23:39:14	@Espyo	a friend on Discord suggested I try using free cam to learn more
2016-12-01 23:39:16	@Espyo	not much to say
2016-12-01 23:39:20	@Espyo	the bubbles and the swirlies are 2D
2016-12-01 23:39:26	@Espyo	oh, hmm...
2016-12-01 23:40:55	Marty2000	Discovered a new cave but didn't enter it, didn't make new Pikmin, ended the day: color is still the same
2016-12-01 23:42:53	Marty2000	Hmmm
2016-12-01 23:43:24	Marty2000	Entered a cave like I did a few minutes ago, quit the game and about to start my slot, and the center is green again
2016-12-01 23:43:37	Marty2000	Entering a cave might change the color (?)
2016-12-01 23:43:52	Marty2000	and leaving it might change color back to what it was before entering?
2016-12-01 23:45:22	Marty2000	I got out of the cave, ended the day, the center is blue again
2016-12-01 23:45:36	Marty2000	remember that Blue Pikmin are the last type I discovered
2016-12-01 23:46:02	Marty2000	I'd like to try this on a real console with a non-hacked game and see what events change the color
2016-12-01 23:46:11	Marty2000	I'll try either tomorrow or Saturday.
2016-12-01 23:46:14	Marty2000	Going to bed now

2016-12-02 14:11:09	@Espyo	yee
2016-12-02 14:21:47	Yoshi2	oh what am i doing with my life, judging nightcore remixes based on the anime pictures they use in the video
2016-12-02 14:33:59	@Espyo	clickbait is so prevalent nowadays that thumbnails are more important than the contents of the video
2016-12-02 14:34:02	@Espyo	don't you let anybody tell you otherwise
2016-12-02 14:36:17	Yoshi2	it's not even really clickbait, the format of nightcore remixes is pretty simple. Take a commercial song, speed it up/change pitch so that it passes off as a remix, when you are happy choose some neat anime picture for it and it's done
2016-12-02 14:36:44	Yoshi2	the picture you see in the thumbnail will be in the video
2016-12-02 14:38:22	@Espyo	guh, I don't get why the code isn't working now
2016-12-02 14:38:34	@Espyo	it works fine, except for finding differences particularly between Wii EU and Wii US, of all things
2016-12-02 14:38:38	@Espyo	it just thinks that they're the same
2016-12-02 14:38:57	@Espyo	it's reading the EU's version as if it were the US's
2016-12-02 14:39:00	@Espyo	and I can't understand why
2016-12-02 14:41:06	Yoshi2	what do you mean it is reading the EU version as if it was US
2016-12-02 14:41:41	@Espyo	file A has "aaa"
2016-12-02 14:41:46	@Espyo	file B has "bbb"
2016-12-02 14:41:50	@Espyo	read file A and tell me what it has
2016-12-02 14:41:52	@Espyo	it has "aaa"
2016-12-02 14:41:56	@Espyo	read file B and tell me what it has
2016-12-02 14:41:59	@Espyo	it has "aaa"
2016-12-02 14:42:01	@Espyo	wat
2016-12-02 14:44:01	@Espyo	simpler than that, I know file B has "bbb", telling him to read JUST file B is telling me it has "aaa"

2016-12-02 14:50:23	Yoshi2	if I had to guess, you ran into a thingy where the object "file B" is actually just a reference to "file A"
2016-12-02 14:50:34	Yoshi2	but can't say for sure without looking at the code

2016-12-02 14:52:42	@Espyo	it's definitely different
2016-12-02 14:52:47	@Espyo	no, this was just Notepad++ not saving

2016-12-04 21:13:07	Yoshi2	I've waited so long for this neptunia game to go on sale but to be honest

2016-12-05 20:00:59	Yoshi2	[8:00 PM] Espyo: I think simple homebrew is enough
2016-12-05 20:00:59	Yoshi2	[8:00 PM] Espyo: but I think it also requires messing with the NAND and all
2016-12-05 20:01:12	Yoshi2	espyo pls dont make things look more complicated than they actually are
2016-12-05 20:02:46	@Espyo	oh, so it's easier than that?

2016-12-05 20:03:36	@Espyo	or are you talking about how I basically said "oh, it's as easy as breathing, all you have to do is to get a master's degree in chemical bioengineering and manipulate Nintendo into doing it"
2016-12-05 20:05:47	Yoshi2	"messing around with nand" appears to sound complicated enough for santa spy to not attempt to do it
2016-12-05 20:06:09	Yoshi2	when in fact the player doesn't mess around with the nand himself, the homebrew channel installer does all the work
2016-12-05 20:06:33	@Espyo	I mean yeaaah, but
2016-12-05 20:06:57	@Espyo	all I know is that back in my Wii fun days, I had to go through a lot of territory I didn't understand just to get Gecko OS to run
2016-12-05 20:06:59	@Espyo	a lot of...scary menus
2016-12-05 20:07:02	@Espyo	with scary numbers
2016-12-05 20:07:08	@Espyo	it's like playing Minesweeper without knowing the rules
2016-12-05 20:07:10	@Espyo	one false option
2016-12-05 20:07:15	@Espyo	and boom, instant 200€ brick
2016-12-05 20:07:15	Testyo	200 € = £ 141.32  / $ 217.44 
2016-12-05 20:08:08	Yoshi2	what
2016-12-05 20:08:36	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-05 20:08:40	@Espyo	look, I don't remember the details
2016-12-05 20:08:54	@Espyo	but I had to do some stuff that involved backing up firmware, setting up NAND versions, stuff like that
2016-12-05 20:08:57	@Espyo	or something along those lines
2016-12-05 20:09:09	@Espyo	I eventually got it to work, but I was terrified of choosing some wrong option and bricking the Wii
2016-12-05 20:11:32	Yoshi2	the main stuff that is scary is bootmii (backing up the nand and keys) and messing around with IOS
2016-12-05 20:11:57	Yoshi2	but I don't think that is necessary for dumping a game
2016-12-05 20:12:19	@Espyo	dunno
2016-12-05 20:14:49	Yoshi2	it's just reading disc data, can't be rocket science
2016-12-05 20:14:59	Yoshi2	if it needed custom IOS things, it would be written here https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games#Using_CleanRip

2016-12-08 12:45:34	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-12-08 12:45:35	Testyo	I was waiting for you ESPYO

2016-12-08 12:54:15	@Espyo	eep
2016-12-08 12:54:19	@Espyo	y-you wanted to see me, Testyo, sir?
2016-12-08 12:54:19	Testyo	So I couldn't play with FBV5 if I first read it, too
2016-12-08 12:54:33	@Espyo	oh, you too, then, Testyo?
2016-12-08 12:54:34	Testyo	they'll be a way to both organize the other two leaders also make funny noises?
2016-12-08 12:54:40	@Espyo	lolwut
2016-12-08 12:54:44	@Espyo	anyway, hi Yoshi2
2016-12-08 13:08:22	Yoshi2	Espyo: i was spooked when you weren't here yesterday
2016-12-08 13:14:13	@Espyo	eh, it's normally fine
2016-12-08 13:14:19	@Espyo	I don't tend to get kidnapped often
2016-12-08 13:14:25	@Espyo	basically, it was a company christmas dinner
2016-12-08 13:18:22	Yoshi2	i see
2016-12-08 14:05:51	Yoshi2	death seems like a nice alternative now https://i.imgur.com/u5qVI8u.png
2016-12-08 14:05:58	Yoshi2	help me
2016-12-08 14:14:02	@Espyo	is this R?
2016-12-08 14:15:05	@Espyo	I can kinda see what you're going for here, but
2016-12-08 14:15:09	@Espyo	strcmpi? where did this come from?
2016-12-08 14:15:13	@Espyo	is the compiler just going nuts?
2016-12-08 14:16:52	Yoshi2	it's matlab
2016-12-08 14:17:06	Yoshi2	and apparently what I'm looking for is linsolve, not solve
2016-12-08 14:18:22	@Espyo	heh, oh
2016-12-08 14:31:19	Yoshi2	maybe solve is for something like x² + x + 1 = 0
2016-12-08 14:31:39	Yoshi2	then the "string" thing and strcmpi would make sense
2016-12-08 14:34:59	@Espyo	right
2016-12-08 15:02:39	Yoshi2	I'm pretty suprised, I thought gaussian elimination was THE way to solve matrices, but supposedly that is not very well conditioned and there are better ways to do it
2016-12-08 15:05:14	Yoshi2	givens rotation, householder transformation
2016-12-08 15:10:10	@Espyo	gaussian, like the same algorithm that goes on in the kind of gaussian blur?
2016-12-08 15:10:21	@Espyo	or is Mr. Gaussian just a guy who made a lot of algorithms?
2016-12-08 15:11:49	Yoshi2	it's Mr. Gauss 
2016-12-08 15:12:32	Yoshi2	no, gaussian blur has nothing to do with gaussian elimination (other than gauss being related to both)
2016-12-08 15:12:48	Yoshi2	gaussian blur is called that way because blurring happens using a gaussian function
2016-12-08 15:14:21	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination
2016-12-08 15:19:02	Yoshi2	Mr. Gauss did make a lot of maths stuff I think
2016-12-08 15:22:05	@Espyo	aah

2016-12-08 16:10:54	@Espyo	programming comes with a free, mandatory dosage of godlike power and eternal suffering
2016-12-08 16:45:12	Yoshi2	i have been looking at this for half an hour or so https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_iteration
2016-12-08 16:45:18	Yoshi2	and i dont get it
2016-12-08 16:48:25	@Espyo	uh, not quite sure I get it either
2016-12-08 16:48:47	@Espyo	the "applications" section barely helps

2016-12-09 12:45:18	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-09 13:40:00	Yoshi2	the reviews for the swimsuit dlc are quite something http://store.steampowered.com/app/476864/
2016-12-09 13:44:21	@Espyo	"don't judge pls" lol
2016-12-09 13:45:03	@Espyo	it's stuff like that, and complaints about nepgear
2016-12-09 13:45:22	Yoshi2	nepgear had a swimsuit in the previous games :(
2016-12-09 13:45:29	Yoshi2	huge disappointment
2016-12-09 13:46:43	@Espyo	oh
2016-12-09 13:46:44	@Espyo	ouch
2016-12-09 13:51:03	Yoshi2	"Let's make EVERYTHING better. Better gameplay, better balance. New characters, new animations/transformation sequences. No swimsuit for one of the most beloved waifus tho. Sorry guys"
2016-12-09 14:05:05	@Espyo	could it be future DLC?
2016-12-09 14:05:09	@Espyo	they know waifus sell
2016-12-09 14:05:40	Yoshi2	don't think so, otherwise it would've already happened
2016-12-09 14:06:00	Yoshi2	maaaybe the Japanese release has it, I heard they went nuts with dlc
2016-12-09 14:06:57	@Espyo	oh, probably then
2016-12-09 14:07:00	Yoshi2	the console release I mean
2016-12-09 14:07:03	@Espyo	like I said, devs know that waifus sell
2016-12-09 14:07:12	@Espyo	they probably just didn't get the demo overseas
2016-12-09 14:07:16	@Espyo	*the memo
2016-12-09 14:07:30	Yoshi2	the game itself exists because waifus sell
2016-12-09 14:13:20	@Espyo	yeah, good point
2016-12-09 14:13:24	@Espyo	unless...
2016-12-09 14:13:32	@Espyo	they want to purposely cut down on the best girl
2016-12-09 14:13:38	@Espyo	so that they can bring her back even better in the sequel
2016-12-09 14:24:49	Yoshi2	prooobably not
2016-12-09 14:25:03	Yoshi2	considering the best girl in question is getting plenty of screen time in the game
2016-12-09 14:25:44	@Espyo	oh
2016-12-09 14:25:46	@Espyo	well then
2016-12-09 14:25:47	@Espyo	RIP the dream
2016-12-09 14:27:47	Yoshi2	i mean she will be in whatever sequel there will be
2016-12-09 14:28:04	Yoshi2	but the swimsuit didn't go missing for the reasons you mentioned

2016-12-09 18:15:39	Yoshi2	i did a new recording about modding BW but now I am trying to edit it and I can't cut off 2 seconds at the start :/
2016-12-09 18:15:47	Yoshi2	I guess I have to re-encode it
2016-12-09 18:18:17	@Espyo	what the
2016-12-09 18:18:18	@Espyo	why not?
2016-12-09 18:23:10	Yoshi2	idk, maybe I recorded it with improper keyframe settings in OBS
2016-12-09 18:26:43	@Espyo	still, hard to imagine
2016-12-09 18:27:11	Yoshi2	the closest I can cut off is at 8 seconds
2016-12-09 18:27:19	Yoshi2	but that's too much
2016-12-09 18:28:45	Yoshi2	re-encoding sucks though because it will take around as much time as the length of the video
2016-12-09 18:29:08	Yoshi2	oh
2016-12-09 18:29:11	Yoshi2	but what if
2016-12-09 18:29:15	Yoshi2	I cut it at 8
2016-12-09 18:29:21	Yoshi2	reencode the first 8 seconds
2016-12-09 18:29:24	Yoshi2	then put the two together
2016-12-09 18:29:39	Yoshi2	genius espyo, that is a great idea of yours
2016-12-09 18:30:35	@Espyo	thanks, I worked hard on it

2016-12-10 21:35:31	Testyo	Hey everyone!
2016-12-10 21:41:46	Yoshi2	wb Espyo & Testyo 
2016-12-10 21:41:46	Testyo	just couldn't remember if it was after or before the next stage
2016-12-10 21:48:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: how has comic con been so far?
2016-12-10 22:04:31	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-10 22:04:34	@Espyo	pretty damn great
2016-12-10 22:04:41	@Espyo	landed top 8 at the Smash tourney
2016-12-10 22:04:45	@Espyo	which isn't bad, but it's not that great
2016-12-10 22:04:59	@Espyo	turns out Cloud, a DLC character is stupid broken
2016-12-10 22:05:02	@Espyo	whowouldvethought
2016-12-10 22:05:18	@Espyo	but other than that, a fair number of people recognized Donnel; I'm pretty pleased
2016-12-10 22:05:22	@Espyo	and it was just pretty fun in general
2016-12-10 22:05:27	@Espyo	gonna go for day 2 tomorrow
2016-12-10 22:05:33	@Espyo	do all the stuff I didn't yet
2016-12-10 22:05:37	@Espyo	hopefully try out Overwatch
2016-12-10 22:30:40	Yoshi2	if you are curious here is the video I uploaded yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYWEXj7PsVs
2016-12-10 22:30:49	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-12-10 22:30:50	@Espyo	thanks
2016-12-10 22:30:58	Yoshi2	also UltraMario ^ if you want to hear more yoshi2
2016-12-10 22:31:03	UltraMario	OwO
2016-12-10 22:31:22	@Espyo	lol
2016-12-10 22:31:46	UltraMario	your voice is kinda cute tbh
2016-12-10 22:31:48	UltraMario	no homo
2016-12-10 22:31:50	UltraMario	Kapp
2016-12-10 22:32:30	Yoshi2	awww <3
2016-12-10 22:32:41	@Espyo	full homo
2016-12-10 22:32:55	@Espyo	chicks dig the German accent
2016-12-10 22:32:59	@Espyo	honestly, chicks just dig accents
2016-12-10 22:33:36	Yoshi2	my voice is kinda on the "less deep" side I think
2016-12-10 22:33:39	UltraMario	ye it's cute
2016-12-10 22:33:41	@Espyo	you speak a bit slowly, and I was gonna recommend speeding it up a touch in Audacity, but I realized that that would explode synching
2016-12-10 22:34:17	@Espyo	eUnitIconVetAnitArmour
2016-12-10 22:34:19	@Espyo	is that a typo?
2016-12-10 22:34:29	@Espyo	you said "anti" in the video, but it's called anit
2016-12-10 22:34:43	Yoshi2	i did mention that in the video
2016-12-10 22:35:09	Yoshi2	typo in the engine code, and when people started working on level design they had to just deal with it
2016-12-10 22:35:33	Yoshi2	my guess at least
2016-12-10 22:35:59	Yoshi2	i should check the binary for that again
2016-12-10 22:37:02	@Espyo	uh
2016-12-10 22:37:07	@Espyo	you didn't quite say it was a typo
2016-12-10 22:37:11	@Espyo	did I just pause in-between you saying it?
2016-12-10 22:37:33	@Espyo	oh, I heard "title" instead of "typo"
2016-12-10 22:37:35	@Espyo	never mind me
2016-12-10 22:37:39	@Espyo	you could probably put that on TCRF
2016-12-10 22:37:43	@Espyo	as a bit of trivia
2016-12-10 22:37:51	Yoshi2	indeed
2016-12-10 22:40:12	Yoshi2	interesting that you thought I was speaking a bit slowly, I didn't think I was speaking particulary slowly (I did do a bunch of pauses because I had to come up with what to say on the spot if that is what you mean)
2016-12-10 22:40:50	@Espyo	I get you
2016-12-10 22:40:54	@Espyo	only a touch, really
2016-12-10 22:40:59	@Espyo	though I do speak pretty fast myself
2016-12-10 22:41:06	@Espyo	and I watch almost all of my videos at 1.4x speed
2016-12-10 22:41:25	@Espyo	sometimes I hear the Game Grumps at 1.0x, and it sounds like they're incredibly drunk
2016-12-10 22:43:31	Yoshi2	1.4x, oh wow
2016-12-10 22:43:38	Yoshi2	you really have no time to waste, do you
2016-12-10 22:45:16	@Espyo	I REALLY don't
2016-12-10 22:45:24	@Espyo	in all seriousness, I DID save a LOT of time over the years
2016-12-10 22:45:32	@Espyo	I can easily say that, since I started, I saved well over 200 hours
2016-12-10 22:45:35	@Espyo	off the top of my head
2016-12-10 22:45:38	@Espyo	probably more
2016-12-10 22:45:41	@Espyo	and you get so used to it
2016-12-10 22:45:46	@Espyo	it has absolutely no impact in the way you watch videos
2016-12-10 22:45:52	@Espyo	you still get the idea perfectly
2016-12-10 22:46:00	@Espyo	and passing isn't really a problem
2016-12-10 22:46:20	@Espyo	since a scene that lasts twice as long as the previous will still last twice as long sped up
2016-12-10 22:47:02	Yoshi2	mhm
2016-12-10 22:49:14	Yoshi2	you do save 33% of a video's playtime if you watch it on 1.5x speed
2016-12-10 22:49:26	@Espyo	yep
2016-12-10 22:50:44	Yoshi2	I watch most long youtube videos in bed at night (when I just need the video to act as a lullababy) or in the morning (when I just need to wake up) so I probably don't lose that much time
2016-12-10 22:51:13	Yoshi2	and a lot of my yt videos I watch at my notebook is music which I can listen to in the background
2016-12-10 22:52:21	Yoshi2	now with anime, I probably won't watch that in 1.5x because that would also mean 33% less time to read the subtitles
2016-12-10 22:52:33	Yoshi2	video games can't really be sped up (except if you skip cutscenes)
2016-12-10 22:52:42	Yoshi2	reddit can't really be sped up
2016-12-10 22:53:06	Yoshi2	programming and modding and making videos can't really be sped up
2016-12-10 22:53:42	Yoshi2	the amount I'd save through watching yt videos sped up would probably be a rounding error compared to how much time I waste elsewhere
2016-12-10 22:54:27	@Espyo	oh, you definitely wouldn't want to skip straight from 1.0x to 1.5x
2016-12-10 22:54:36	@Espyo	it's hilarious, but your head will hurt
2016-12-10 22:54:39	@Espyo	I had to ease myself in
2016-12-10 22:55:02	@Espyo	hey, not like I watch a lot of videos
2016-12-10 22:55:10	@Espyo	but I do have my daily "schedule" of videos

2016-12-14 21:36:21	@Espyo	Yoshi2: what am I looking at in that image?
2016-12-14 21:38:03	Yoshi2	Espyo: left is the original, right is encoded according to DXT1 principles (2 unique colors for 4x4 pixels, 2 more colors are calculated based on those and each pixel in a 4x4 area can have one of those 4 colors)
2016-12-14 21:38:03	DrDrastic	what????
2016-12-14 21:38:23	DrDrastic	Oh...
2016-12-14 21:38:40	@Espyo	oh, should've realized that, heh
2016-12-14 21:39:02	@Espyo	doesn't look like it's *quite* there yet though
2016-12-14 21:39:13	@Espyo	the little tank icon has really thick lines when it should have thinner ones
2016-12-14 21:39:20	@Espyo	in some parts

2016-12-14 21:39:57	@Espyo	in other news, it looks like Pikmin 2 only changes ONE treasure between the GameCube and Wii
2016-12-14 21:40:03	@Espyo	I could swear it changed more
2016-12-14 21:40:38	@Espyo	it's g_futa_kyusyu and g_futa_sikoku, which are swapped exclusively in the US versions

2016-12-14 21:42:01	@Espyo	lol
2016-12-14 21:42:10	@Espyo	he asked Testyo what he was, but that was only like 5 messages

2016-12-14 22:24:00	Yoshi2	well i didn't want this to happen https://i.imgur.com/v0nQLrc.png
2016-12-14 22:30:00	@Espyo	and that's how you burn down a
2016-12-14 22:30:02	@Espyo	...a banana?
2016-12-14 22:30:32	Yoshi2	apparently so
2016-12-14 22:30:40	Yoshi2	I tried to use linear regression
2016-12-14 22:31:10	Yoshi2	turns out every maths site has its own formula for doing it and i can't get them to work properly
2016-12-14 22:31:19	@Espyo	gaaah
2016-12-14 22:31:27	@Espyo	that was infuriating to read
2016-12-14 22:32:36	Yoshi2	how hard can it be, i have 16 values (colors) and i want a line through it that fits the data best
2016-12-14 22:33:22	@Espyo	ugh
2016-12-14 22:33:26	@Espyo	I remember wanting that too, ages ago
2016-12-14 22:33:29	@Espyo	and just not finding it
2016-12-14 22:33:37	@Espyo	even though I learned it in college
2016-12-14 22:33:58	@Espyo	when we had some digging speeds for the Pikmin and we wanted some function or formula to get intermediate values
2016-12-14 22:34:04	@Espyo	guess that's just interpolation
2016-12-14 22:34:10	@Espyo	but there were all these fancy methods
2016-12-14 22:34:15	@Espyo	plus stuff that actually gave a FORMULA
2016-12-14 22:34:26	@Espyo	like y = x * 2 + 3.4 - x * 0.1
2016-12-14 22:35:00	Yoshi2	interpolation is for when you have two points and you want to know data for a point inbetween them
2016-12-14 22:35:51	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-14 22:35:56	@Espyo	but I think it can also be used to get what you want
2016-12-14 22:36:04	@Espyo	geez, I REALLY wish I knew this more
2016-12-14 22:36:21	@Espyo	that's what you get when you're force-fed info to learn to pass exams
2016-12-14 22:36:39	Yoshi2	i have a booklet on statistics
2016-12-14 22:36:44	Yoshi2	too tired to read it though
2016-12-14 22:37:45	Yoshi2	that shall be for tomorrow or so, good night
2016-12-14 22:37:50	@Espyo	good idea

2016-12-15 18:47:24	@J	Yoshi2: depending on what you're doing, you might find a bezier curve is good enough
2016-12-15 18:48:02	@J	literally takes an integer giving the 'smoothness' and then your series of values in however many dimensions
2016-12-15 18:48:10	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo & J 
2016-12-15 18:48:11	Testyo	you said "anti" in the render distance so short is kind of weird
2016-12-15 18:49:20	Yoshi2	a bezier curve, mhmm
2016-12-15 18:51:43	Yoshi2	well, I did end up figuring it out

2016-12-15 18:53:01	Yoshi2	then I went ahead and applied it to a huge picture https://i.imgur.com/74CS3JO.png

2016-12-16 18:54:22	Testyo	Evening everyone!
2016-12-16 18:57:17	@J	evening Testyo
2016-12-16 18:57:18	Testyo	And send the three hey
2016-12-16 19:03:07	@Espyo	hey hey hey
2016-12-16 19:12:02	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-12-16 19:12:02	Testyo	I think so too
2016-12-16 19:12:28	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-16 19:12:40	@Espyo	ok, dropbox is getting rid of the public folder
2016-12-16 19:12:51	@Espyo	meaning that the only way we'll have to share content with others is via sharing pages
2016-12-16 19:12:54	@Espyo	and not via direct links
2016-12-16 19:13:28	@Espyo	also I need to request a link for every single file instead of just using a URL like dl.dropbox.com/u/askjdashd/file_name.jpg
2016-12-16 19:13:37	@Espyo	I want out so badly
2016-12-16 19:13:59	@Espyo	but there's no other simple, free service that does backups, synching, and sharing...
2016-12-16 19:14:53	Yoshi2	i can kinda live with having to request a link because I no longer do automatic syncing so I upload a file one by one
2016-12-16 19:15:21	@Espyo	when I want to share something with someone, I want it snappy
2016-12-16 19:15:53	@Espyo	if I need to set up a whole system just to show how this one image looks, and thirty seconds later, do it all again to show how a second image looks after some changes, rinse and repeat, I'm gonna get pretty annoyed pretty quickly
2016-12-16 19:20:53	@Espyo	oh, I didn't even notice
2016-12-16 19:20:58	@Espyo	but this ALREADY doesn't work:
2016-12-16 19:20:59	@Espyo	Testyo: help
2016-12-16 19:20:59	Testyo	Help file: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/47921869/Permanent/Testyo/Help.html Ask Espyo for more info!
2016-12-16 19:21:13	@Espyo	it gives you a download to an html file instead of displaying the page as it used to
2016-12-16 19:32:06	Yoshi2	rip
2016-12-16 19:32:59	@J	maybe get some web hosting, it can get pretty cheap
2016-12-16 19:33:39	@J	I currently pay something like £20/year
2016-12-16 19:33:40	Testyo	£ 20 = 28.304 € / $ 30.772

2016-12-16 19:36:41	@Espyo	yeah, but that's just it, I don't think I want it so badly that I'd be willing to pay for it
2016-12-16 19:36:43	@Espyo	even if it is cheap
2016-12-16 19:36:56	@Espyo	I only backup my stuff like once every month
2016-12-16 19:37:06	@Espyo	and honestly, an external hard drive would work just fine
2016-12-16 19:37:12	@Espyo	except for the whole "if the house goes, everything goes" thing
2016-12-16 19:37:23	@J	I was thinking of the sharing at that point
2016-12-16 19:37:35	@Espyo	synching and sharing are a bit rare, but when I need them, I'd rather not be fumbling and just have something accessible
2016-12-16 19:37:54	@Espyo	so, when you want to share something, what's the process you go through?
2016-12-16 19:38:09	@J	I have a script which uploads something via FTP
2016-12-16 19:38:22	@J	I type 'upl-share path/to/file' and it copies the URL to the clipboard
2016-12-16 19:38:59	@J	maybe you could run a server on your computer if you only need to share stuff while you're actually online
2016-12-16 19:39:18	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-12-16 19:39:27	@Espyo	hmm... probably not a bad idea, actually
2016-12-16 19:39:38	@J	for backup, if you have a relative or friend you somewhat trust, you can use CrashPlan to back up to each other's computers (I believe that functionality is free)
2016-12-16 19:39:50	@Espyo	oh, never heard of that
2016-12-16 19:39:58	@Espyo	sounds good
2016-12-16 19:40:21	@Espyo	hmm, as for sharing, let's see...
2016-12-16 19:40:37	@Espyo	for stuff I want to share for a long time, I think hosting on imgur or MEGA would do just fine...
2016-12-16 19:40:53	@Espyo	and I can probably get a very easy local server set up and running
2016-12-16 19:41:18	@J	the only issue there is keeping track of your IP, if it's not static
2016-12-16 19:41:20	@Espyo	plus Discord, which is pretty much where I speak with people most of the time, already allows uploads pretty easily
2016-12-16 19:41:25	@Espyo	oh, good point
2016-12-16 19:41:26	@Espyo	it's not
2016-12-16 19:41:31	@Espyo	though that's probably still easy
2016-12-16 19:41:33	@Espyo	case in point:
2016-12-16 19:41:33	@J	you can probably write some code to check the current IP and use that
2016-12-16 19:41:36	@Espyo	Testyo: stats
2016-12-16 19:41:37	Testyo	Stats: http://37.189.123.43:8080/MainTestyo/stats
2016-12-16 19:41:39	@Espyo	^
2016-12-16 19:41:40	@J	or you could use dynamic DNS
2016-12-16 19:41:42	@J	yeah

2016-12-16 19:41:54	@Espyo	all right, liking the idea
2016-12-16 19:41:58	@Espyo	as for synching...
2016-12-16 19:42:23	@J	never really did that myself, not sure what you'd care to sync
2016-12-16 19:42:24	@Espyo	well, I guess what really bugs me is that almost every day, I realize "oh, I gotta do this when I get home" while at work
2016-12-16 19:42:28	@Espyo	and then just read the file at home
2016-12-16 19:42:36	@Espyo	uh
2016-12-16 19:42:41	@Espyo	*so I point that idea down
2016-12-16 19:42:45	@Espyo	that should've been in the middle
2016-12-16 19:43:00	@Espyo	and I'm preeeetty sure there have to be some services out there that do this pretty easily
2016-12-16 19:43:03	@Espyo	I just don't know any
2016-12-16 19:43:30	@Espyo	and if I need to access stuff on different devices for a bit, which is pretty rare, I'm sure I can use some small service as well
2016-12-16 19:43:35	@J	I don't understand, you mean you have a webpage or file to read, but want to do it at home?
2016-12-16 19:43:43	@J	wouldn't you just email it then?
2016-12-16 19:44:06	@Espyo	I have a text file on my dropbox with stuff to do
2016-12-16 19:44:33	@J	okay, and you want to edit it from multiple places
2016-12-16 19:44:40	@Espyo	mhm
2016-12-16 19:44:46	@J	guess you could use Google Docs or something for that?
2016-12-16 19:44:52	@J	never really done that sort of thing myself
2016-12-16 19:44:53	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-16 19:44:59	@Espyo	ooooone tiny thing, though
2016-12-16 19:45:01	@Espyo	and I hope I'm wrong
2016-12-16 19:45:06	@Espyo	but Google Docs is all or nothing
2016-12-16 19:45:11	@Espyo	by that, I mean...
2016-12-16 19:45:13	@Espyo	you either don't use it
2016-12-16 19:45:27	@Espyo	or you have to get ready to use the bloated text document GUI
2016-12-16 19:45:28	@J	I also run an SSH server at home, so I can access files remotely
2016-12-16 19:45:36	@Espyo	I just want to edit a text file, not write an essay...
2016-12-16 19:45:43	@Espyo	yeah, but that requires keeping my machine on
2016-12-16 19:45:51	@Espyo	I'd do it in a heartbeat
2016-12-16 19:45:54	@Espyo	it sounds like a dream
2016-12-16 19:45:55	@J	yes, I run a Raspberry Pi all the time for that purpose
2016-12-16 19:45:59	@Espyo	just being able to access my stuff through the command line
2016-12-16 19:46:05	@Espyo	yeah, I remember you saying before
2016-12-16 19:46:10	@Espyo	but I'm a bit of a power saver...
2016-12-16 19:46:17	@Espyo	though if I DID have something running 24/7
2016-12-16 19:46:22	@Espyo	it'd also fix the "share stuff while offline" problem
2016-12-16 19:47:08	@J	I figure running a Raspberry Pi for a year is probably equivalent to having the heating on for one evening
2016-12-16 19:47:24	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-16 19:47:30	@Espyo	though there's a bit more overhead than just that
2016-12-16 19:47:41	@J	I also run IRC on there, and a TV recording setup, and a VPN server, and it's a backup destination
2016-12-16 19:47:48	@Espyo	having one plug available, for one
2016-12-16 19:47:53	@Espyo	huh, nice
2016-12-16 19:49:01	@Espyo	oh, there was another thing which USED to be valid, but isn't nowadays, but
2016-12-16 19:49:03	@Espyo	my router
2016-12-16 19:49:13	@Espyo	we used to shut it down over the night to save power
2016-12-16 19:49:23	@Espyo	and then turn it on whenever one of us needed and leave it on till night
2016-12-16 19:49:42	@Espyo	but this one is a router-bridge-TVbox-hybrid thingamajig
2016-12-16 19:50:03	@Espyo	so we need to keep it on all the time, unless we wanna wait 10 minutes of boot-up time just to watch TV
2016-12-16 19:50:16	@Espyo	so that's pretty fun
2016-12-16 19:51:00	@Espyo	https://drivenotepad.github.io/ *shrug*
2016-12-16 19:51:02	@J	wow, you distracted me so effectively I forgot about my food
2016-12-16 19:51:43	@Espyo	now that I'm finding hard to believe
2016-12-16 19:52:20	@J	it was on the other side of the room
2016-12-16 19:52:45	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2016-12-16 19:54:23	@Espyo	well, I did this study some months back
2016-12-16 19:54:26	@Espyo	and pCloud seemed okay...
2016-12-16 19:54:30	@Espyo	file sharing sucks in it, though
2016-12-16 19:54:50	@Espyo	but hey, if I'm gonna go with a private server and plain old Discord attachments, that's not really a problem
2016-12-16 20:18:49	@Espyo	ok, what would you recommend for a private server?
2016-12-16 20:18:55	@Espyo	...building it myself from scratch?
2016-12-16 20:19:08	@Espyo	I mean, I got Testyo to do it, but I ain't fond of rebuilding the wheel here
2016-12-16 20:19:08	Testyo	hm, I'm not sure

2016-12-16 21:28:24	@J	if you just want to serve files, Python has a built-in one
2016-12-16 21:28:48	@J	'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' will just share files in the current directory
2016-12-16 21:37:34	@Espyo	...wow
2016-12-16 21:39:57	@Espyo	weird
2016-12-16 21:40:01	@Espyo	I can access it with localhost
2016-12-16 21:40:04	@Espyo	but not with my IP
2016-12-16 21:40:20	@Espyo	probably because my router is intercepting
2016-12-16 21:40:30	@Espyo	since it's the router login page
2016-12-16 21:41:02	@Espyo	wait, just like THAT?

2016-12-16 21:56:23	@Espyo	thanks google

2016-12-16 21:57:37	@Espyo	why I said "my ISP" and not "meo"

2016-12-17 15:09:01	@Espyo	http://skrekkogle.com/still-file/
2016-12-17 16:56:38	@Espyo	J: ok, so, I was thinking
2016-12-17 16:56:44	@Espyo	I'd have a Python process running the HTTP server
2016-12-17 16:57:13	@Espyo	and then have a different Python script that copy whatever file I want into my server's folder, and then place the URL to the file on the clipboard
2016-12-17 16:57:18	@Espyo	I can do that pretty easily
2016-12-17 16:57:40	@Espyo	thing is, I'd rather not have to query my IP every single time I run the "share and place link on clipboard" script
2016-12-17 16:58:12	@Espyo	so I was thinking: the script that starts up the server could start by getting my IP first, saving it somewhere for whenever the "share/clipboard" process needs it, and then spend the rest of runtime on the server
2016-12-17 16:58:19	@Espyo	what would be the best way to store this?
2016-12-17 16:58:33	@Espyo	I was thinking environment variables, until I realized I actually don't know as much about them as I thought I did
2016-12-17 16:58:45	@Espyo	I could always save it in a file... but isn't that a bit dumb? there's gotta be a better way
2016-12-17 16:58:53	@Espyo	of course, I can just make my IP static, but eh, too much effort
2016-12-17 16:59:09	@Espyo	Yoshi2: you too, if you wanna give your two cents

2016-12-17 19:31:46	Yoshi2	Espyo: where does that "share/clipboard" script run and where does the server process run?
2016-12-17 19:32:55	@Espyo	they're both Python scripts in my machine
2016-12-17 19:33:02	@Espyo	the server would be running all day, in the background
2016-12-17 19:33:08	@Espyo	the script would be called when needed from the command line
2016-12-17 19:33:16	Yoshi2	both run on the same machine?
2016-12-17 19:33:18	@Espyo	do-share cool_image.jpg
2016-12-17 19:33:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-12-17 19:34:39	Yoshi2	and the clipboard script would automatically make a url like http://hack.me.pls/definitely_not_pikmin_lewds.png
2016-12-17 19:37:29	@Espyo	yep
2016-12-17 19:37:35	@Espyo	or well, it'd put a URL in the clipboard
2016-12-17 19:40:58	Yoshi2	option 1: server places IP into file, clipboard script reads it
2016-12-17 19:41:44	Yoshi2	option 2: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-12-17 19:42:44	Yoshi2	if the server launched the script you could do stuff with pipes or shared variables or stuff
2016-12-17 19:43:47	@Espyo	right
2016-12-17 19:44:02	@Espyo	file seems the way to go... but there has to be something cleaner
2016-12-17 19:44:39	@Espyo	it's like you want to let your neighbor know that the BBQ is gonna happen at 18:00
2016-12-17 19:44:51	@Espyo	so you create a new house next to yours with a massive sign saying "IT'S AT 18:00"
2016-12-17 19:44:54	@Espyo	it works, but... what
2016-12-17 19:45:05	Yoshi2	what's the alternatives
2016-12-17 19:45:22	@Espyo	that's just it, I don't know... but I'm sure they have to exist...
2016-12-17 19:45:46	Yoshi2	in linux everything is a file so
2016-12-17 19:46:28	Yoshi2	you could write stuff into a database and then the script queries it and
2016-12-17 19:46:33	Yoshi2	that's like writing a file anyway
2016-12-17 19:47:02	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-12-17 19:48:25	Yoshi2	you could write a registry entry and that's
2016-12-17 19:48:30	Yoshi2	worse than writing into a file
2016-12-17 19:48:40	@Espyo	good thing this is Linux
2016-12-17 19:48:46	@Espyo	no such nonsense
2016-12-17 19:48:57	@Espyo	even if I were on windows... eesh, I'd rather create a whole FOLDER than mess with that
2016-12-17 19:54:06	Yoshi2	I managed to set up the new router we have now
2016-12-17 19:54:17	Yoshi2	got an extra 1mbit/s out of it strangely enough
2016-12-17 19:55:07	@Espyo	out of setting it up? or out of it being a new one?
2016-12-17 20:10:53	Yoshi2	it comes with settings for the ISP (my old one doesn't have settings so I picked some I found for the ISP) so maybe that helped
2016-12-17 20:15:14	@Espyo	ah
2016-12-17 20:15:15	@Espyo	nice

2016-12-17 23:08:34	@J	Espyo: I would just save it in a file, files are great
2016-12-17 23:08:55	@Espyo	good enough for me then
2016-12-17 23:11:30	@J	or you could have the server also listen on an internal report for requests that instruct it to share a file
2016-12-17 23:11:58	@J	it responds with a full URL which the run-once script copies to the clipboard
2016-12-17 23:12:03	@J	probably more work though
2016-12-17 23:12:12	@J	uh...
2016-12-17 23:12:17	@J	not sure why I said 'report'
2016-12-17 23:12:26	@J	obviously meant to be 'port'
2016-12-17 23:13:02	@J	or it could be a named pipe or whatever, some sort of socket
2016-12-17 23:13:22	@Espyo	oh
2016-12-17 23:13:28	@Espyo	yeah, sounds like overengineering
2016-12-17 23:13:30	@Espyo	would be fun, but

2016-12-20 14:26:10	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-20 14:26:28	Marty2000	I like Christmas because I can eat a lot :P
2016-12-20 14:26:52	Yoshi2	I get presents
2016-12-20 14:27:05	Yoshi2	well this year's present I picked out myself
2016-12-20 14:27:14	Marty2000	Nice
2016-12-20 14:27:32	Marty2000	My family usually give me money so that I can buy what I want
2016-12-20 14:29:16	Yoshi2	I went with my dad into a store yesterday and I picked the thing to buy
2016-12-20 14:29:58	Marty2000	I see
2016-12-20 14:30:13	Marty2000	I'm going to my grandparents' for Christmas
2016-12-20 14:30:50	Yoshi2	my grandparents are in russia so that's no option
2016-12-20 14:31:03	Marty2000	Ah :/
2016-12-20 14:33:41	Marty2000	I've bought Pikmin 2 on the Eshop since my disc rarely works
2016-12-20 14:33:55	Marty2000	I feel like the loading times are reduced when playing
2016-12-20 14:35:08	Yoshi2	it is possible
2016-12-20 14:35:26	Yoshi2	especially if you download it to the internal drive or a HDD which have higher speeds than the disc drive
2016-12-20 14:35:46	Marty2000	I suppose so
2016-12-20 14:36:04	Marty2000	I didn't download it to a HDD though, but it's faster still
2016-12-20 14:36:21	Marty2000	and you have the original New Play Control! Manual with it :P

2016-12-20 19:05:58	@Espyo	well yeaaaaah, but that's pretty much always true
2016-12-20 19:06:06	Marty2000	:P
2016-12-20 19:10:45	Marty2000	I haven't even checked if the glitch I want to talk about is on Pikipedia. I'll do that first, heh
2016-12-20 19:11:02	Marty2000	But basically, it's related to crushing
2016-12-20 19:12:01	Marty2000	Looks like it's not on Pikipedia, so I'll explain it. It's very simple
2016-12-20 19:12:51	Marty2000	If a Pikmin gets crushed while carrying an object, it'll keep carrying said object until its spirit appears (=death)
2016-12-20 19:13:14	Marty2000	I assume it's a glitch because the Pikmin is crushed and it only happens in Pikmin 2, not Pikmin or Pikmin 3
2016-12-20 19:13:33	@Espyo	huh, neat
2016-12-20 19:13:37	@Espyo	I can imagine it
2016-12-20 19:13:54	@Espyo	I can't find any uses for it, but it's still neat
2016-12-20 19:13:59	@Espyo	at least, off the top of my head
2016-12-20 19:14:00	@Espyo	hm
2016-12-20 19:14:08	@Espyo	delivering something to an Onion and getting an extinction at the same time?
2016-12-20 19:14:16	Marty2000	Yeah, it doesn't have any particular uses

2016-12-22 19:30:33	@Espyo	this is a handmade MIDI, right?

2016-12-22 19:36:02	@Espyo	I think it's just that the WW soundfont doesn't lend itself well to the song

2016-12-22 20:22:24	Marty2000	Prologue - The songs are from Kirby: Planet Robobot I think
2016-12-22 20:22:31	Marty2000	I haven't checked that channel in ages
2016-12-22 20:23:39	Yoshi2	yes
2016-12-22 20:39:17	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Yellow_Wollywog | http://www.pikminwiki.com/Wollywog I'm surprised the articles do not explain the #1 difference between the two species in Pikmin 2
2016-12-22 20:39:33	Marty2000	You can approach a Yellow Wollywog without them noticing you
2016-12-22 20:39:42	Marty2000	but that doesn't work with a Wollywog
2016-12-22 20:39:52	Marty2000	(and it's only in P2, not in in the first Pikmin)
2016-12-22 20:40:13	@Espyo	...I didn't know this

2016-12-22 20:40:37	Marty2000	but I'm gonna add it :)

2016-12-22 20:41:47	Marty2000	Closed the tab .-.
2016-12-22 20:42:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-12-22 20:42:07	@Espyo	according to the technical data
2016-12-22 20:42:12	@Espyo	a YW's FOV is 120
2016-12-22 20:42:15	@Espyo	a W's FOV is 180
2016-12-22 20:42:25	@Espyo	but either these values are stupid, which is likely, since duh, Pikmin 2
2016-12-22 20:42:41	@Espyo	or that should mean that the Wollywog only sees what's in front of it and to the sides
2016-12-22 20:42:49	@Espyo	and the Yellow Wollywog only sees what's in front of it
2016-12-22 20:43:01	@Espyo	it's probably written in angles for each side
2016-12-22 20:43:02	Marty2000	The Wollywog sees the player even behind its back
2016-12-22 20:43:05	@Espyo	right
2016-12-22 20:43:05	Marty2000	but not the Yellow one
2016-12-22 20:43:07	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-22 20:43:52	Marty2000	By the way, speaking of weirdness (which is fairly common in P2), I've been trying to understand how an enemy respawns in P2
2016-12-22 20:44:09	Marty2000	I understand how a Dwarf Red Bulborb respawns
2016-12-22 20:44:14	Marty2000	but a Red Bulborb...
2016-12-22 20:44:18	@Espyo	ooh, that can't be easy
2016-12-22 20:44:24	@Espyo	well, have you seen the game's files?
2016-12-22 20:44:24	Marty2000	I've spent two hours on this and it's such a mess

2016-12-22 20:44:35	@Espyo	might help
2016-12-22 20:44:38	Marty2000	but I think I'm starting to understand
2016-12-22 20:44:41	@Espyo	which Red Bulborb in particular?
2016-12-22 20:44:43	Marty2000	I just can't explain :P
2016-12-22 20:44:50	Marty2000	The one in the Valley of Repose
2016-12-22 20:45:07	@Espyo	you just had to pick one of the most "special" ones :P
2016-12-22 20:45:15	Marty2000	Of course :P
2016-12-22 20:45:34	Marty2000	The Red Bulborb always spawn on the first day of a 4-day period, but
2016-12-22 20:45:39	Marty2000	also of a 6-day cycle
2016-12-22 20:45:40	Marty2000	and...
2016-12-22 20:45:45	Marty2000	let me check my notes, I'm already lost

2016-12-22 20:49:20	@Espyo	love how the Honeywisp at the Valley of Repose is nicknamed "Honeywisp near tuto2"
2016-12-22 20:49:28	@Espyo	"should we name the cave? nah"
2016-12-22 20:49:34	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-12-22 20:49:59	@Espyo	wow that's insane :S
2016-12-22 20:50:11	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-22 20:50:41	@Espyo	hmmmmmmm
2016-12-22 20:50:52	@Espyo	I wonder if the format of the "loop" files
2016-12-22 20:50:56	Marty2000	It's easier for an enemy like the Beady Long Legs, since you know it appears every 10 days starting from day 31 (so, even if you kill it on day 40, it'll reappear on day 41)
2016-12-22 20:51:04	@Espyo	is like "starting day-number of days in loop"
2016-12-22 20:51:13	Marty2000	but for this one Red Bulborb...
2016-12-22 20:51:16	Marty2000	It's possible
2016-12-22 20:51:21	@Espyo	like, you've got files like "0-1", "1-2", "1-4", "10-29"
2016-12-22 20:51:53	@Espyo	maybe for the nonloop folder, these file names mean "starts on day 0, lasts 1 day" (makes sense for day 1), "starts on day 1, lasts 2 days", "starts on day 10, lasts 29 days", etc.
2016-12-22 20:52:09	@Espyo	I can probably check with the Perplexing Pool
2016-12-22 20:52:16	@Espyo	if there's a file called something like "30-1"
2016-12-22 20:52:19	@Espyo	for the Beady Long Legs
2016-12-22 20:52:27	@Espyo	oh, I just now read what you said
2016-12-22 20:52:30	@Espyo	in that case, "30-10" :P
2016-12-22 20:52:43	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-22 20:53:38	Marty2000	Honestly, that respawn thing is crazy, I wouldn't be surprised if it were glitched :P
2016-12-22 20:53:51	@Espyo	found the Red Bulborb; its in nonloop/1-4.txt
2016-12-22 20:54:16	@Espyo	so... if the theory were to match...
2016-12-22 20:54:32	@Espyo	that means it spawns on day 2 (internally day 1)
2016-12-22 20:54:35	@Espyo	and respawns every 4 days?
2016-12-22 20:54:43	Marty2000	Theoretically, yes,
2016-12-22 20:54:43	@Espyo	oh, but this is nonloop, so it shouldn't loop...
2016-12-22 20:54:50	Marty2000	but, if I check my notes (lemme check)
2016-12-22 20:54:51	@Espyo	lemme check the enemy's block itself
2016-12-22 20:54:56	@Espyo	 0 		# teki_birth_type
2016-12-22 20:54:59	Marty2000	*Killed on Day 431 *Reappeared on Day 435 4-day period?
2016-12-22 20:55:08	@Espyo	that's the only thing it says regarding respawns
2016-12-22 20:55:08	Marty2000	this is okay, but at some point
2016-12-22 20:55:17	Marty2000	*Supposed to reappear on Day 439 *Reappeared on Day 437 6-day cycle (day 431 – day 437),  4-day period (day 431-day 435)?
2016-12-22 20:55:19	@Espyo	yeah, it doesn't match your notes
2016-12-22 20:55:23	Marty2000	"reappeared on day 437"
2016-12-22 20:55:30	Marty2000	this is where it doesn't match
2016-12-22 20:55:45	Marty2000	(and this is what I call the 6-day cycle by the way, lol)
2016-12-22 20:55:56	@Espyo	ah
2016-12-22 20:56:48	Marty2000	So it does appear every four day, but when you kill it on the fourth day, it reappears two days afterwards...
2016-12-22 20:57:17	@Espyo	hmm

2016-12-22 21:04:55	@Espyo	hopefully one day I'll study and understand the format
2016-12-22 21:05:03	@Espyo	and then we'll hopefully figure out what's up with the spawning
2016-12-22 21:05:08	@Espyo	but feel free to conduct your research still
2016-12-22 21:05:21	@Espyo	if you can figure it out, that'll be great, since I can cross-check it with what the game files say
2016-12-22 21:06:02	Marty2000	Yep, I'll try to ;) There's likely an explanation
2016-12-22 21:06:24	Marty2000	Reminds me of the cave thing (with the leaders being switched when you enter a cave)

2016-12-22 21:21:58	Marty2000	You can get really close... and you're still unnoticed
2016-12-22 21:22:26	@Espyo	right
2016-12-22 21:22:38	@Espyo	it's the view angle, but it also has some special case if you touch it
2016-12-22 21:23:01	Marty2000	Yes
2016-12-22 21:23:12	Marty2000	If you touch it, it immediately notices you
2016-12-22 21:23:22	Marty2000	but the Wollywog wil notice you before that happens anyway
2016-12-22 21:23:27	Marty2000	will*
2016-12-22 21:23:34	@Espyo	right
2016-12-22 21:24:33	Marty2000	No idea if this happens in P3, but I do know it doesn't happen in P1
2016-12-22 21:24:44	Marty2000	I mean, for the Yellow Wollywog
2016-12-22 21:29:49	Marty2000	In P3, the Yellow Wollywog notices you wherever you approach it from
2016-12-22 21:29:56	Marty2000	so it's a P2 thing.
2016-12-22 21:40:10	@Espyo	ah, right
2016-12-22 21:40:14	@Espyo	all worth adding to the wiki imo
2016-12-22 21:42:07	Marty2000	I already added this: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Yellow_Wollywog&curid=1748&diff=170425&oldid=169817 
2016-12-22 21:42:20	Marty2000	Do you think it's enough? I might just add it's a P2 only thing
2016-12-22 21:42:44	Marty2000	and I might add that the Wollywog can notice the player from anywhere
2016-12-22 21:43:40	@Espyo	yeah, add both of those
2016-12-22 21:49:11	Marty2000	Done ;)

2016-12-25 20:37:40	Yoshi2	picture quality is a bit bad due to poor light so it hides a couple of not so good looking spots

2016-12-25 20:41:40	Yoshi2	normally i am supposed to paint the model but I don't have the proper equipment for that so I'm just trying to put it together
2016-12-25 20:42:30	@Espyo	will you paint it after?
2016-12-25 20:43:07	Yoshi2	One day maybe
2016-12-25 20:43:28	Yoshi2	I never finished my previous models due to not being sure how to paint them

2016-12-26 15:09:53	@Espyo	tsk, this is complicated
2016-12-26 15:10:21	@Espyo	technically, yeah, when he came back to Hocotate only for the President to send him back because there's more treasure, that counted as the third visit
2016-12-26 15:10:31	@Espyo	but like, are we sure that that is canon?
2016-12-26 15:10:36	@Espyo	hm, I guess the cutscene IS
2016-12-26 15:10:43	@Espyo	it's just ambiguous whether 100% completion is canon or not
2016-12-26 15:10:46	@Espyo	or has it already been confirmed?
2016-12-26 15:10:51	@Espyo	I don't even know any more
2016-12-26 15:20:24	Marty2000	I don't know either
2016-12-26 15:21:02	Marty2000	I guess when they say thid visit, it's like "third canon game"
2016-12-26 15:21:45	Marty2000	But technically speaking, it's the fourth visit indeed 
2016-12-26 15:21:52	Marty2000	third*
2016-12-26 15:23:26	Marty2000	Do we know if Olimar and Louie came back for *another* debt? Or is "a debt" the only mentioned thing?
2016-12-26 15:23:49	Marty2000	I think "another debt" is mentioned in a file, but I'm not sure, I'll check on Pikipedia
2016-12-26 15:29:06	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Olimar%27s_Log_(Exploration_Notes)#Journal_Entry_.231 "that debt"
2016-12-26 15:29:14	Marty2000	Do we really know if it's a second debt?
2016-12-26 15:46:09	Yoshi2	i thought there was only one debt
2016-12-26 15:46:26	Marty2000	Yeah, in Pikmin 2, there's one debt
2016-12-26 15:46:40	Marty2000	but in Pikmin 3, while you're playing with Alph, Brittany, and Charlie,
2016-12-26 15:46:57	Marty2000	Olimar and Louie have come back for more treasures
2016-12-26 15:47:03	Marty2000	because of a debt :P
2016-12-26 16:16:56	@Espyo	yeah, we don't know which debt this is
2016-12-26 16:29:43	Marty2000	In Pikmin, there's a little time needed for a Pikmin to start drowning: this time is short, but it can be noticed: https://youtu.be/cOzMINHAeDE
2016-12-26 16:30:11	Marty2000	See, sometimes, the Red Pikmin will walk into water without drowning
2016-12-26 16:30:55	Marty2000	Also, I have witnessed some strange stuff at the Distant Spring :P
2016-12-26 16:30:56	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/8a9721RH--Y
2016-12-26 16:31:45	Marty2000	Whenever I whistle, the Red Pikmin's head reacts... that's weird, heh
2016-12-26 16:48:41	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-12-26 16:48:53	@Espyo	maybe the game only checks for non-Blues underwater one out of every 10 frames or so, to save processing power
2016-12-26 16:49:02	@Espyo	so if you happen to put a Pikmin during frames 1 to 9, it won't find out
2016-12-26 16:49:48	@Espyo	lol what?
2016-12-26 16:49:52	@Espyo	that's weird
2016-12-26 16:49:57	@Espyo	is this the first time you've seen this?
2016-12-26 16:50:00	@Espyo	I'm wondering if this isn't on purpose
2016-12-26 16:50:11	@Espyo	like, whenever you whistle, nearby Pikmin face that way a bit
2016-12-26 16:50:24	Marty2000	That would make sense
2016-12-26 16:50:26	Marty2000	and yeah
2016-12-26 16:50:30	Marty2000	first time I've seen this
2016-12-26 16:50:44	Marty2000	I tried to reproduce it, but it didn't happen again
2016-12-26 16:50:56	Marty2000	and it stopped when I threw the Yellow Pikmin
2016-12-26 16:51:05	Marty2000	no idea how and why that happened :P

2016-12-26 17:12:14	@Espyo	weird, then
2016-12-26 18:27:08	Marty2000	I've been wondering, has someone ever been on day 1000 in Pikmin 2?
2016-12-26 18:27:18	Marty2000	I've never seen a screenshot or video with someone being on day 1000 :P
2016-12-26 18:27:37	Marty2000	So, I wonder if it's even possible to reach that day
2016-12-26 18:29:09	Yoshi2	ez
2016-12-26 18:29:54	Marty2000	I still have my very first save and I'm only on day 489, heh
2016-12-26 18:35:45	UltraMario	hey guys yoshi2 is trying to make a pikmin 2 sf2 :o
2016-12-26 18:35:54	UltraMario	(soundfont file)
2016-12-26 18:36:25	Yoshi2	*um told yoshi2 to make a pikmin2 sf2
2016-12-26 18:36:30	UltraMario	heh
2016-12-26 18:36:32	UltraMario	:^)
2016-12-26 18:36:41	UltraMario	dont you want PIKMIN 2 SOUNDFONT REMIXES? ;P
2016-12-26 18:37:14	UltraMario	it'd be good to have for other pikmin fans too tho that want to make remixes with it
2016-12-26 18:37:19	UltraMario	so
2016-12-26 18:37:46	UltraMario	id say go for it :D
2016-12-26 18:37:56	UltraMario	sure the midi game has kinda died down lately but *shrugs*
2016-12-26 18:38:39	Marty2000	Nice
2016-12-26 18:38:58	Yoshi2	i am having lots of second thoughts now though

2016-12-26 18:39:33	Marty2000	Don't you always have them? :(
2016-12-26 18:39:36	Yoshi2	if making a proper soundfont requires note mapping and stuff that isn't in the wav files then this will be painful
2016-12-26 18:39:37	UltraMario	^
2016-12-26 18:39:39	Marty2000	RIP you
2016-12-26 18:39:40	UltraMario	er
2016-12-26 18:39:46	UltraMario	what is nope mapping tho
2016-12-26 18:40:43	UltraMario	*note
2016-12-26 18:40:46	UltraMario	nope mapping lol
2016-12-26 18:40:50	Yoshi2	nope mapping is when i start work and then i go
2016-12-26 18:40:57	Yoshi2	"nope nope nope nope"
2016-12-26 18:41:01	UltraMario	lmao
2016-12-26 18:41:05	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-26 18:41:40	UltraMario	wait what did you use to extract gamecube soundfont anyway
2016-12-26 18:41:41	UltraMario	curious
2016-12-26 18:43:30	UltraMario	(but really what is note mapping)
2016-12-26 18:43:34	UltraMario	lol
2016-12-26 18:43:48	UltraMario	is that like how the instrument sounds at different pitches
2016-12-26 18:43:48	Yoshi2	wwdumpsnd
2016-12-26 18:44:00	Yoshi2	idk what note mapping is, probably what you said
2016-12-26 18:44:20	UltraMario	heh
2016-12-26 18:44:40	UltraMario	maybe you could have someone help with that

2016-12-26 18:45:06	@Espyo	Marty2000: ask PikFan

2016-12-26 18:45:17	@Espyo	and then his hopes were crushed by somebody with a LOT more days
2016-12-26 18:45:21	UltraMario	i wonder what an adsr envelope is though
2016-12-26 18:45:23	UltraMario	also hey espyo
2016-12-26 18:45:39	Yoshi2	should i attempt to crush his hopes by hex editing
2016-12-26 18:45:49	@Espyo	hey UM
2016-12-26 18:45:55	@Espyo	too easy
2016-12-26 18:46:14	Marty2000	Okay, Espyo
2016-12-26 18:46:24	UltraMario	ive been trying to see if yoshi2 can help me make a pikmin 2 soundfont ;p
2016-12-26 18:46:25	Marty2000	Too easy :P
2016-12-26 18:46:55	UltraMario	also wait doesnt the ww thing only work with wind waker and sunshine?
2016-12-26 18:47:07	UltraMario	"wwdumpsnd 0.4 extracts the sound effects and instrument samples from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. They are dumped as plain WAVs. To use, all the .aw files from /Audiores/Banks and JaiInit.aaf from /Audiores must be in the current directory when wwdumpsnd is run. 100 MB of WAVs are created.
2016-12-26 18:47:08	UltraMario	0.3 fixes some issues with the format of the WAV.
2016-12-26 18:47:10	UltraMario	0.4 adds Super Mario Sunshine support thanks to ichifish and Dolphin.
2016-12-26 18:47:11	UltraMario	Note that there are some samples that sound quite off, such as in mboss_0.aw. I suspect that these are stereo (the vast majority are mono and that is all I handle) but I haven't worked it out yet."
2016-12-26 18:48:23	Yoshi2	it works with other games too i think
2016-12-26 18:48:26	UltraMario	oh]
2016-12-26 18:48:32	Yoshi2	now how accurate the results are is a different story
2016-12-26 18:48:37	UltraMario	i guess it works with other things but they havent tested it with them probs
2016-12-26 18:48:39	UltraMario	yeah
2016-12-26 18:49:12	Yoshi2	Espyo: have there been attempts at a pikmin2 soundfont or is it an exercise in futility
2016-12-26 18:49:39	@Espyo	there haven't been any attempts that I know
2016-12-26 18:49:44	@Espyo	I don't think making a soundfont is hard
2016-12-26 18:49:56	@Espyo	...but you're probably going to die if you want a near-perfect recreation

2016-12-26 18:50:17	UltraMario	maybe you can do a good enough and then edit later

2016-12-26 18:50:30	UltraMario	i wouldnt worry too much
2016-12-26 18:50:40	UltraMario	but imagine this
2016-12-26 18:50:52	UltraMario	you can be famous for being the guy who did the pikmin 2 soundfont

2016-12-26 19:05:58	UltraMario	well
2016-12-26 19:06:01	UltraMario	it's good enough i guess?
2016-12-26 19:06:03	UltraMario	lol
2016-12-26 19:06:23	Yoshi2	um i already managed to extract the instrument sounds
2016-12-26 19:06:26	UltraMario	well
2016-12-26 19:06:29	UltraMario	i want to try my hand
2016-12-26 19:06:32	UltraMario	at extracting stuff
2016-12-26 19:06:34	UltraMario	mayb
2016-12-26 19:06:39	Yoshi2	go for it
2016-12-26 19:06:50	UltraMario	does viena look any better though
2016-12-26 19:06:52	UltraMario	than poly w/e
2016-12-26 19:06:54	UltraMario	lol
2016-12-26 19:07:10	UltraMario	i wanna know what one you think is better so maybe i can try to make a soundfont soon :o
2016-12-26 19:08:44	UltraMario	i wanna do luigi's mansion
2016-12-26 19:08:51	UltraMario	since that surprisingly hasnt had a soundfont made of it
2016-12-26 19:09:09	Yoshi2	polyphone has less stuff, viena has more stuff
2016-12-26 19:09:15	Yoshi2	i think viena might be better
2016-12-26 19:09:35	Yoshi2	ok lol, viena made a single instrument out of the samples I imported
2016-12-26 19:10:11	Yoshi2	that might be a perfect presentation of why note mapping is important. No note mapping and it does some crap that doesn't make sense
2016-12-26 19:10:18	UltraMario	ooo
2016-12-26 19:10:33	UltraMario	it automatically mapped?
2016-12-26 19:11:27	UltraMario	:o
2016-12-26 19:11:42	UltraMario	oh wait
2016-12-26 19:11:45	UltraMario	you mean like
2016-12-26 19:11:47	UltraMario	a single sf2 file?
2016-12-26 19:11:54	Yoshi2	it mapped all sounds to a single instrument
2016-12-26 19:12:09	UltraMario	ono
2016-12-26 19:12:14	Yoshi2	the sounds are different instruments though so this makes no sense
2016-12-26 19:12:21	UltraMario	well there's 2 ways you could do your thing
2016-12-26 19:12:28	UltraMario	either have all the instruments in one sf2
2016-12-26 19:12:32	UltraMario	or have separate sf2s
2016-12-26 19:12:36	UltraMario	for each instrument
2016-12-26 19:12:56	UltraMario	thats how ive seen these soundfont things ive downloaded so far
2016-12-26 19:13:47	UltraMario	Yoshi2: maybe show a screen or something so i have a better idea for some of these things ;p
2016-12-26 19:14:18	UltraMario	im dumb and still a noob to this so
2016-12-26 19:14:58	Yoshi2	ok i deleted this instrument and then made a new instrument from one of the wav files and it tones it up/down, nice
2016-12-26 19:15:28	UltraMario	ooo
2016-12-26 19:15:35	UltraMario	it automatically did that for you? :ooo
2016-12-26 19:15:39	UltraMario	the toning thing
2016-12-26 19:15:45	Yoshi2	sounds like fucking aids at the upper range though lel
2016-12-26 19:15:57	UltraMario	yeah that's natural though
2016-12-26 19:16:10	UltraMario	some of the soundfont things ive downloaded are ear piercing at upper range
2016-12-26 19:16:11	UltraMario	so
2016-12-26 19:16:25	UltraMario	it's not like you'd have a midi thatd go that high that often anyway
2016-12-26 19:16:27	UltraMario	heh
2016-12-26 19:17:40	UltraMario	but it's good that it auto pitches cuz i was worried id have to do that stuff myself lol
2016-12-26 19:18:11	Yoshi2	there is some data that I haven't filled in yet and idk if I should fill it in or not
2016-12-26 19:18:37	UltraMario	what kind of data
2016-12-26 19:19:05	Yoshi2	attentuation, pan, sample mode
2016-12-26 19:19:05	UltraMario	wait
2016-12-26 19:19:07	UltraMario	ooo
2016-12-26 19:19:09	Yoshi2	and other crap
2016-12-26 19:19:22	UltraMario	yoshi2 that tcrf page lists the instruments
2016-12-26 19:19:30	UltraMario	https://tcrf.net/Notes:Pikmin_2#List
2016-12-26 19:19:33	UltraMario	that could help you
2016-12-26 19:19:34	UltraMario	making the soundfont
2016-12-26 19:20:27	Yoshi2	Everything else is just instruments (I checked).
2016-12-26 19:20:28	Yoshi2	wScene_1 sounds like the Valley of Repose.
2016-12-26 19:20:28	Yoshi2	wScene_2 sounds like the Awakening Wood.
2016-12-26 19:20:28	Yoshi2	wScene_3 sounds like the Perplexing Pool.
2016-12-26 19:20:28	Yoshi2	wScene_4 sounds like the Wistful Wild.
2016-12-26 19:20:29	Yoshi2	wScene_48 sounds like the Waterwraith's theme.
2016-12-26 19:20:33	Yoshi2	THANK
2016-12-26 19:20:36	UltraMario	see?
2016-12-26 19:20:41	UltraMario	i knew that'd come in handy
2016-12-26 19:20:47	UltraMario	tcrf can be helpful :^)(
2016-12-26 19:20:58	Yoshi2	:^⁾
2016-12-26 19:21:43	UltraMario	i thought of an idea for your soundfont tho
2016-12-26 19:21:59	UltraMario	wasnt there an easter egg where pikmin sing ai no uta
2016-12-26 19:22:03	UltraMario	or was that only pikmin 1
2016-12-26 19:22:35	Yoshi2	i only know of the easter egg where pikmin sing crawling in my skin
2016-12-26 19:22:41	UltraMario	lmao
2016-12-26 19:23:00	UltraMario	oh wait
2016-12-26 19:23:09	UltraMario	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Easter_egg#Singing
2016-12-26 19:23:28	UltraMario	i was thinknig you could make pikmin into instrument
2016-12-26 19:23:30	UltraMario	s
2016-12-26 19:23:38	UltraMario	:^)
2016-12-26 19:27:37	Yoshi2	i selected three sound files and now i will attempt to make an instrument out of them because i think they are one instrument
2016-12-26 19:27:49	UltraMario	ah
2016-12-26 19:29:35	UltraMario	im guessing they're like the same instrument?
2016-12-26 19:29:38	UltraMario	the 3 sound files
2016-12-26 19:33:32	UltraMario	is that list proving useful though? :^)
2016-12-26 19:37:34	Yoshi2	actually meh, I can't really make this sound any decent if I put all three samples into the same instrument
2016-12-26 19:37:46	Yoshi2	no idea how to do note mapping in viena
2016-12-26 19:38:01	UltraMario	ono
2016-12-26 19:40:23	UltraMario	ill try googling
2016-12-26 19:40:42	Yoshi2	it's 9pm already, i will take a break now
2016-12-26 19:40:44	Yoshi2	good luck um

2016-12-26 19:42:25	UltraMario	ill let you know if i need any help
2016-12-26 19:42:27	UltraMario	:p
2016-12-26 19:42:58	Yoshi2	ok
2016-12-26 19:43:13	Yoshi2	the basic idea seems to be to turn each sample into its own instrument 
2016-12-26 19:43:28	Yoshi2	won't be 100% accurate but at least it should get some results
2016-12-26 19:45:30	UltraMario	as long as i dont have to do the pitch stuff
2016-12-26 19:45:32	UltraMario	lol
2016-12-26 19:51:58	UltraMario	should i do another game though or help you with pikmin 2

2016-12-26 19:54:18	Yoshi2	whatever you want, though helping with pikmin 2 increases the chances of a pikmin 2 soundfont happening :>

2016-12-26 20:03:33	Yoshi2	why not both (also you need sample .wav files anyway) :P
2016-12-26 20:04:00	@Espyo	did you manage to get it over 100 yet?
2016-12-26 20:04:11	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-26 20:04:20	Marty2000	Just did it in the Hole of Heroes several times

2016-12-26 20:08:16	Yoshi2	for the most part, i am in the same shoes as you because i have no idea how soundfonts are made and how viena is used
2016-12-26 20:08:23	Yoshi2	all i know is the sound files go into samples
2016-12-26 20:08:28	Yoshi2	then from samples you make instruments
2016-12-26 20:08:31	UltraMario	pikmin 2 soundfont seems true

2016-12-26 21:56:57	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Vegetation#Red_mushroom.2Fleaf It's hard to say if they are the same plants, but
2016-12-26 21:56:59	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Scan_49.jpeg
2016-12-26 21:57:34	Marty2000	The names of the red mushrooms are ハナオチバタケ (marasmius pulcherripes) and when checking on Wikipedia,
2016-12-26 21:57:50	Marty2000	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marasmius those white mushrooms are quite similar to the red leaves, aren't they?
2016-12-26 21:59:39	Marty2000	I don't know if I should separate the red leaves from the red mushrooms in the article, but I plan on adding the real name if you agree with that (Marasmius Pulcherripes)
2016-12-26 21:59:46	Marty2000	and of course, the Japanese name
2016-12-26 22:00:51	Espyo	uh, kinda similar, yeah...

2016-12-26 22:01:38	Marty2000	or whatever they're called?
2016-12-26 22:04:59	Espyo	if it's Prima, then no
2016-12-26 22:05:03	Espyo	they're not exactly canon >_>
2016-12-26 22:05:46	Marty2000	Nvortex got those scans, so we'd have to ask him where he found them
2016-12-26 22:06:03	Marty2000	The only problem is that I haven't seen him in ages
2016-12-26 22:06:05	Espyo	yeah

2016-12-26 22:19:16	Espyo	I'm pretty sure I've seen it before, but I'm not sure if we have it
2016-12-26 22:22:23	Marty2000	Oh, I see. I was just surprised to see an early version of the Challenge Mode :P
2016-12-26 22:23:22	Espyo	we gotta add it
2016-12-26 22:24:34	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_2_prerelease_information I'd add it here

2016-12-27 19:12:05	Marty2000	I'd have an explanation but it's unlikely to be true... Maybe it tried to shake and return home at the same time, and since it didn't know what to do first, it froze?

2016-12-27 20:17:01	@Espyo	can you try editing a page under mobile?
2016-12-27 20:17:13	Marty2000	Okay
2016-12-27 20:17:14	@Espyo	Pikipedia:Sandbox, if you've got no article that you want to make changes to
2016-12-27 20:17:21	@Espyo	I'm asking because of this https://twitter.com/KingCowfish/status/812699726848159745
2016-12-27 20:17:34	@Espyo	apparently the wiki is asking for a captcha code, but there is no captcha to go along with it
2016-12-27 20:17:46	StarWolf	I Was looking at some fannon pages made with my old account about two years ago. All I could do was cringe 
2016-12-27 20:18:33	Marty2000	I don't remember seeing any captcha the last time I made an edit on mobile (a few days ago), but I'm gonna retry
2016-12-27 20:19:08	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think I do either...
2016-12-27 20:19:13	@Espyo	but since I'm admin, maybe it's different?
2016-12-27 20:20:21	@Espyo	yeah, that's likely it http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:ListGroupRights
2016-12-27 20:20:30	@Espyo	autoconfirmed users don't even get captcha
2016-12-27 20:20:38	@Espyo	and a user becomes autoconfirmed when...
2016-12-27 20:20:51	@Espyo	they have reached 10 edits and have the account for at least 4 days
2016-12-27 20:21:02	@Espyo	so that user on twitter is probably not autoconfirmed

2016-12-27 20:21:08	@Espyo	still, it's a pain that the captcha isn't working

2016-12-27 21:52:01	Marty2000	I wonder if this happens in P2 (probably not, but it definitely is worth trying) but I don't remember seeing a Swooping Snitchbug near fire
2016-12-27 21:52:16	@Espyo	I'm thinking some cave might have it
2016-12-27 21:52:44	Marty2000	Oh
2016-12-27 21:52:48	Marty2000	yes, or

2016-12-27 21:54:12	Marty2000	but the Fiery Blowhog moving randomly will make it harder, so I'll check the caves

2016-12-28 18:57:30	Marty2000	No Yoshi2. However, when the day ends, enemies do notice leaders during the lift off cutscene (you can tell because they're trying to attack you). However, if the leaders were KO'd before the lift off cutscene, that will simply not happen
2016-12-28 18:57:39	Marty2000	It's a small glitch, but it's still a glitch :P
2016-12-28 18:59:58	Yoshi2	if normally they notice alive leaders and don't notice KO'd leaders, and in the lift off cutscene they notice alive leaders and don't notice KO'd leaders, what is the glitch here?
2016-12-28 19:00:54	Marty2000	The KO'd leaders are normally no longer KO'd when they enter the ship
2016-12-28 19:00:56	Marty2000	... I think
2016-12-28 19:01:43	Marty2000	Think of KO'd leaders as dead leaders / leaders that can't move
2016-12-28 19:02:00	Marty2000	during the cutscene, the leaders move again and such, so they're... alive again
2016-12-28 19:02:04	Marty2000	but well, you may be right too
2016-12-28 19:02:26	Marty2000	I'll guess I'll wait for Espyo, but it seems weird to me
2016-12-28 19:04:23	Marty2000	There are other glitches related to KO'd leaders, by the way
2016-12-28 19:04:43	Yoshi2	oh, dead leaders become alive again during the cutscene and then the enemies don't notice them?
2016-12-28 19:04:51	Marty2000	Yeah, sorta
2016-12-28 19:05:15	Yoshi2	I've never killed off my leaders so I didn't know what would happend at the end

2016-12-28 21:14:06	Marty2000	Hi Espyo
2016-12-28 21:14:20	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-28 21:16:00	Yoshi2	hi Espyo 
2016-12-28 21:16:06	@Espyo	hi
2016-12-28 21:16:13	Yoshi2	we were starting to miss you
2016-12-28 21:19:44	@Espyo	fixing OS-crashing bugs by nighttime
2016-12-28 21:19:48	@Espyo	cutting my hair by nighttime
2016-12-28 21:19:54	@Espyo	everything is at nighttime because of winter
2016-12-28 21:20:06	Yoshi2	oh fun
2016-12-28 21:20:12	@Espyo	but my point is, I had to stay an hour and a half more to try to figure out why some machines were actually breaking at OS level
2016-12-28 21:20:22	@Espyo	and then I had to get my hair cut
2016-12-28 21:20:27	Yoshi2	did you figure it out?
2016-12-28 21:20:31	@Espyo	nope
2016-12-28 21:20:36	@Espyo	sounds like an OS problem
2016-12-28 21:20:40	@Espyo	we use in-house distros of Linux
2016-12-28 21:20:49	@Espyo	but it DOES only happen on a specific game
2016-12-28 21:20:54	@Espyo	...and our best bet is
2016-12-28 21:20:56	@Espyo	and hear me out on this
2016-12-28 21:21:00	@Espyo	that it's because of the game's name
2016-12-28 21:21:08	@Espyo	recently, somebody added an exclamation mark to the name of the game
2016-12-28 21:21:18	@Espyo	and MAYBE, just MAYBE, when the OS reads the game's name to install it

2016-12-28 21:21:27	@Espyo	we're honestly at a loss
2016-12-28 21:21:46	@Espyo	but it'd be pretty funny if that's the case
2016-12-28 21:21:50	@Espyo	and hey, it CAN be!

2016-12-28 21:34:49	Marty2000	really a glitch, though*

2016-12-28 21:53:18	@Espyo	there's an easy way to check
2016-12-28 21:53:22	@Espyo	though it likely seems intentional
2016-12-28 21:53:25	@Espyo	though...
2016-12-28 21:53:35	@Espyo	see, the thing is, I think the real glitch is them being detected in the first place
2016-12-28 21:53:59	@Espyo	but you can KO one leader, and then bring an enemy next to its body on the ship
2016-12-28 21:54:12	@Espyo	if the enemy ignores that leader, then it's clear that there is code for enemies to ignore leaders with 0 HP
2016-12-28 21:54:18	@Espyo	so that just naturally extends to the cutscene
2016-12-28 21:55:03	Marty2000	"but you can KO one leader, and then bring an enemy next to its body on the ship" I think it will ignore the dead leader, yeah
2016-12-28 21:55:15	@Espyo	I think it will as well
2016-12-28 21:56:20	Marty2000	I asked because of this: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Invisible_leader
2016-12-28 21:56:58	Marty2000	Not really related except that the glitch is about an interaction with a dead leader, so...
2016-12-28 21:57:27	Marty2000	Oh well, at least that trivia stuff didn't go unnoticed, unlike the dead leaders :P
2016-12-28 22:01:49	@Espyo	right

2016-12-28 22:28:12	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Empty_space_container_2.jpg it's "Empty Space Container" in NPC2... but that's odd, because I've always thought it was "space container" too in the NPC version
2016-12-28 22:28:38	Marty2000	Well, it's "Empty Space Container" in the treasure hoard
2016-12-28 22:28:51	Marty2000	no idea if it's the same when the ship analyzes it
2016-12-28 22:31:07	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/d2VJwSBdH4E same when the Ship analyzes it, then...
2016-12-28 22:31:16	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/d2VJwSBdH4E?t=6m30s
2016-12-28 22:31:53	Marty2000	“When all these containers pile up in my ship, I start to wonder... would I be better off working as a treasure hunter or should I stay in the transportation business as always?”
2016-12-28 22:31:55	Marty2000	this changes as well
2016-12-28 22:32:23	Marty2000	“When all these containers pile up in my ship, I start to wonder... would I be better off working as a treasure hunter, or stay in the transportation business as always?”
2016-12-28 22:35:11	Marty2000	I'll add all of this info to the article and you'll see if there's stuff to change :)
2016-12-28 22:38:33	@Espyo	I thought we had this info documented...
2016-12-28 22:39:04	@Espyo	well, okay, please add it all
2016-12-28 22:39:24	Marty2000	I think it was for another treasure... :P
2016-12-28 22:39:28	Marty2000	Sure
2016-12-28 22:41:34	@Espyo	yep, I can confirm it
2016-12-28 22:41:43	@Espyo	I'm running EU NPCP2 right now
2016-12-28 22:42:41	Marty2000	The screenshot may be useless but I feel like it was needed... one question, though...
2016-12-28 22:42:54	Marty2000	how do you add Olimar's notes already?
2016-12-28 22:44:04	@Espyo	edit Notes:Empty space container/olimar
2016-12-28 22:44:06	@Espyo	well...
2016-12-28 22:44:13	@Espyo	edit Notes:Empty space container/olimareuwii
2016-12-28 22:44:15	@Espyo	...I think
2016-12-28 22:44:20	@Espyo	wait, just /olimarwii
2016-12-28 22:44:22	@Espyo	...I think
2016-12-28 22:45:01	Marty2000	isn't it rather "journal"?
2016-12-28 22:45:22	@Espyo	or that
2016-12-28 22:45:56	Marty2000	and I think I have to create "Notes:Empty space container/journalwii" and rename the normal one as "Notes:Empty space container/journalgc"
2016-12-28 22:46:06	Marty2000	like for the Open Archive
2016-12-28 22:46:09	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Notes:Open_Archive/journalwii
2016-12-28 22:46:11	@Espyo	yeah, that should be it

2016-12-28 22:49:36	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Empty_space_container hopefully it worked

2016-12-28 23:05:40	Marty2000	"Hocatate"
2016-12-28 23:05:45	Marty2000	is that in the Gamecube version?
2016-12-28 23:06:05	Marty2000	Or is that a mistake that was made when the entry was added?
2016-12-28 23:11:15	@Espyo	yeah, missing .
2016-12-28 23:11:24	@Espyo	Hocatate?
2016-12-28 23:11:25	@Espyo	where is this?

2016-12-28 23:12:38	@Espyo	it's right there
2016-12-28 23:12:40	@Espyo	just noticed, sorry
2016-12-28 23:12:44	@Espyo	lemme double check both versions
2016-12-28 23:12:50	Marty2000	Oh, it's okay
2016-12-28 23:13:01	Marty2000	It's "Hocotate" in the Wii version
2016-12-28 23:13:04	Marty2000	okay ;)
2016-12-28 23:14:09	@Espyo	"Hocatate" on the GameCube
2016-12-28 23:14:10	@Espyo	hah
2016-12-28 23:14:14	@Espyo	can't believe I didn't notice it before
2016-12-28 23:14:21	@Espyo	wanna add a {{sic}} to the word?
2016-12-28 23:14:29	Marty2000	Sure
2016-12-28 23:14:33	Marty2000	Thanks for checking
2016-12-28 23:14:37	@Espyo	np
2016-12-28 23:14:42	Marty2000	..."Hocatate", heh
2016-12-28 23:14:47	@Espyo	also, technically...
2016-12-28 23:14:51	@Espyo	when you have ellipsis and then a space
2016-12-28 23:14:54	@Espyo	that's the start of a new sentence
2016-12-28 23:15:00	@Espyo	and that "boy" starts with a lowercase
2016-12-28 23:15:02	@Espyo	so...
2016-12-28 23:15:07	@Espyo	that's also another typo
2016-12-28 23:15:19	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-28 23:15:40	@Espyo	these typos are so awful...
2016-12-28 23:15:45	@Espyo	and there's so many of them
2016-12-28 23:15:48	@Espyo	it's shameful
2016-12-28 23:15:50	Marty2000	"but" starts wih a lower case too after "before"
2016-12-28 23:15:54	Marty2000	Hah
2016-12-28 23:16:49	@Espyo	oh, yep!
2016-12-28 23:16:59	@Espyo	better check the other notes for this specific problem, too
2016-12-28 23:17:52	Marty2000	Yep
2016-12-28 23:18:20	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Notes:Empty_space_container/journalwii like here, already
2016-12-28 23:18:31	Marty2000	Be right back
2016-12-28 23:18:36	@Espyo	yep
2016-12-28 23:18:44	@Espyo	hm, but I'll have to double-check if that really IS true
2016-12-28 23:19:55	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-12-28 23:19:59	@Espyo	looks like it's actually a style choice
2016-12-28 23:20:01	@Espyo	well damn
2016-12-28 23:20:32	@Espyo	in that case, I think it's better to forget that kind of "typo", since it's not really...real
2016-12-28 23:20:56	Marty2000	Hah :P well, should I cancel these, then? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Notes:Divine_Cooking_Tool/journalgc
2016-12-28 23:21:00	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-28 23:21:21	@Espyo	yes, please
2016-12-28 23:21:32	@Espyo	(except for Hocatate, of course)
2016-12-28 23:22:10	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-28 23:22:11	Marty2000	;)
2016-12-28 23:32:37	@Espyo	hey Marty, wanna upload these images as well? http://image.jeuxvideo.com/images/gc/p/k/pkm2gc003.jpg http://image.jeuxvideo.com/images/gc/p/k/pkm2gc028.jpg
2016-12-28 23:32:42	@Espyo	I'm afraid of them being lost to time
2016-12-28 23:32:59	@Espyo	maybe this one too, if it has any difference? http://image.jeuxvideo.com/images/gc/p/k/pkm2gc050.jpg
2016-12-28 23:33:02	@Espyo	I think it might have
2016-12-28 23:33:04	@Espyo	namely the leader icons
2016-12-28 23:33:34	Marty2000	The lighting seems different for the leader icons
2016-12-28 23:33:35	Marty2000	and sure
2016-12-28 23:33:54	@Espyo	yep, the leader icons are definitely early
2016-12-28 23:33:58	Marty2000	do I add those images to [[Prerelease information]]?
2016-12-28 23:33:58	@Espyo	not so much because of the lighting
2016-12-28 23:34:10	@Espyo	but because of they cut off outside of the bubble, at the bottom
2016-12-28 23:34:15	@Espyo	like other early P2 screenshots
2016-12-28 23:34:22	Marty2000	And this treasure (the... Empty space container/Space Container :P) isn't normally there
2016-12-28 23:34:24	@Espyo	yeah, that (except it's the P2 prerelease article)
2016-12-28 23:34:32	@Espyo	oh, good point, yeah
2016-12-28 23:34:35	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-12-28 23:34:39	@Espyo	there's quite a lot to say about that one
2016-12-28 23:35:15	Marty2000	Oh, for the lighting, I thought you were talking about the image with the Space Container
2016-12-28 23:35:32	Marty2000	yeah, the other one has the leaders cut off outside their bubbles

2016-12-29 19:49:37	Yoshi2	any progress on the OS issue?
2016-12-29 19:52:10	@Espyo	yep
2016-12-29 19:52:25	@Espyo	turns out one of the guys there was doing a fresh install of the OS
2016-12-29 19:52:31	@Espyo	and on the USB stick he used, he had some leftover files
2016-12-29 19:52:39	@Espyo	and the OS's installation dumps those files too somehow
2016-12-29 19:52:53	@Espyo	and it amounted to like 4GB on a 1.5 GB hard disk
2016-12-29 19:52:58	@Espyo	= hard disk goes boom
2016-12-29 20:04:22	Yoshi2	so the bug was sitting between the monitor and the chair

2016-12-29 20:58:00	Marty2000	If you want a random screenshot, Yoshi2, I have this one that I like: http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/0/09/Comparisons.jpg
2016-12-29 20:58:15	Marty2000	If it's not what you were looking for, then feel free to ask me again :P
2016-12-29 20:58:58	Marty2000	Pikipedia is also full of those screenshots, I think
2016-12-29 21:04:23	@Espyo	Marty2000: is this a screenshot or a texture? http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Wistful_Wild_Background.jpg
2016-12-29 21:04:42	Yoshi2	Marty2000: how about pikmin standing next to one or several pellet posies
2016-12-29 21:05:45	Marty2000	Screenshot, Espyo. Do we need textures instead of screenshots for backgrounds? Yoshi2: sure, I guess I can find such a screenshot ;)
2016-12-29 21:06:06	@Espyo	no, I was just wondering how it's so pristine
2016-12-29 21:06:13	@Espyo	did you use the "hold R" camera?
2016-12-29 21:06:27	Marty2000	Piklopedia
2016-12-29 21:06:31	@Espyo	oh
2016-12-29 21:06:36	Marty2000	Wollywog in the air or Waterwraith
2016-12-29 21:06:45	Marty2000	:P
2016-12-29 21:06:48	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-12-29 21:09:36	Marty2000	Yoshi2: do you want a particular Pikmin game or any game is fine?
2016-12-29 21:10:55	Yoshi2	whichever is more convenient for you
2016-12-29 21:11:41	Marty2000	I'm on P3 right now, so... P3 then
2016-12-29 21:17:17	Marty2000	Yoshi2: https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69j7x1H84a6SsCR
2016-12-29 21:17:47	Marty2000	Is it good or would you like another screenshot? 
2016-12-29 21:17:47	Yoshi2	Marty2000: thanks a lot, that one is great
2016-12-29 21:17:56	Marty2000	Yoshi2: no problem
2016-12-29 21:25:38	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Rock_Pikmin "10 on a charge's first attack" I remember finding an exception to this and writing it here a few months ago but I don't even remember what it was .-.
2016-12-29 21:25:49	Marty2000	I'll che
2016-12-29 21:25:53	Marty2000	ck*
2016-12-29 21:26:02	Marty2000	(I hate you cat)
2016-12-29 21:26:45	@Espyo	oh yeah, I remember that too
2016-12-29 21:32:55	Marty2000	2016-06-10 21:44:58	Marty2000	So when charging, Rock Pikmin deal the same number of damages as when they are thrown (only for gates)
2016-12-29 21:33:29	Marty2000	So charging damage = throw damage when they're attacking a crystal gate :P
2016-12-29 21:53:03	@Espyo	better add it to the wiki now lest you forget
2016-12-29 21:53:07	@Espyo	...again
2016-12-29 21:56:52	Marty2000	Heh, yep, I have a short memory :P I added the information to the infobox, I'll experiment with the other gates as well to see if the value changes only with crystal gates or the other types as well
2016-12-29 21:57:07	@Espyo	I'm afraid the infobox will get bloated...
2016-12-29 21:57:15	@Espyo	might as well have a "technical information" section in the article
2016-12-29 21:57:18	@Espyo	explaining all of this in detail
2016-12-29 21:57:28	@Espyo	and then on the infobox just saying "depends, see [[#Technical information|here]]"
2016-12-29 21:57:30	Marty2000	Yeah, and then we remove the info from the infobox?
2016-12-29 21:57:35	Marty2000	Okay
2016-12-29 22:04:31	Marty2000	Okay so I'll make the section, I checked again to see if the info was true, now I'm going to test with another gate
2016-12-29 22:07:28	Marty2000	That oddity happens with all gates, not with the crystal ones only ;)
2016-12-29 22:07:28	@Espyo	awesome
2016-12-29 22:07:36	@Espyo	well, at least there's SOME consistency there
2016-12-29 22:07:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-12-29 22:24:30	Marty2000	The section is light, tell me if you think it could be improved (or if it could be located elsewhere)
2016-12-29 22:24:31	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Rock_Pikmin#Technical_information
2016-12-29 22:25:13	Marty2000	Usually, this kind of section appears near the bottom of the article, but I thought it would be better placed near "Traits and abilities" here
2016-12-29 22:26:13	Marty2000	"when charging towards a gate, a Rock Pikmin will deal the same amount of damage as when thrown." I think this one trick could be useful for speedruns, it it hasn't been used already
2016-12-29 22:31:40	@Espyo	might be useful
2016-12-29 22:31:45	@Espyo	if all Rocks aim at the same spot
2016-12-29 22:31:50	@Espyo	otherwise you're better off aiming yourself
2016-12-29 22:33:08	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-12-29 22:33:32	@Espyo	wait, so wouldn't this mean that a gate's "damage by thrown Rock" amount is 20?
2016-12-29 22:33:36	@Espyo	sorry, 10?
2016-12-29 22:34:55	Marty2000	I don't think so, because they take more time to destroy the gate when lunging
2016-12-29 22:34:59	Marty2000	so... must be higher
2016-12-29 22:35:05	Marty2000	but I don't know the exact value
2016-12-29 22:35:17	@Espyo	:/
2016-12-29 22:35:23	@Espyo	better point that down
2016-12-29 22:35:28	@Espyo	maybe with a {{game help|p3}}
2016-12-29 22:39:07	Marty2000	Okay
2016-12-29 22:39:44	@Espyo	uuuuhhhmmm
2016-12-29 22:39:47	Marty2000	I just know that, to destroy a crystal gate, you need 24 Rock Pikmin hits
2016-12-29 22:39:57	@Espyo	didn't we use to have, on the wiki, information about what each game does when there's 100 P--
2016-12-29 22:39:58	@Espyo	oh, right!
2016-12-29 22:40:02	@Espyo	it's on the 100 Pikmin limit article
2016-12-29 22:40:06	@Espyo	never mind
2016-12-29 22:40:19	@Espyo	I thought each gate was different
2016-12-29 22:40:42	Marty2000	Well, for Mission Mode, yeah, because some are already partially destroyed when you start the mission
2016-12-29 22:40:58	Yoshi2	does this sound in any way pikmin-ish to you? https://soundcloud.com/debugyoshi/mario-luigi-superstar-saga-pikmin2-soundfont-test
2016-12-29 22:41:05	Marty2000	I don't thin kit's different for each gate otherwise, as long as you throw you Pikmin to the same part of the gate
2016-12-29 22:41:32	@Espyo	sounds like it came right out of the SNES
2016-12-29 22:41:39	@Espyo	only the trumpet at the back strikes me as a bit Pikmin 2ish
2016-12-29 22:41:42	@Espyo	the rest... not really
2016-12-29 22:42:16	@Espyo	I thought we had reached that conclusion...
2016-12-29 22:42:23	Yoshi2	mhm, that's what I thought
2016-12-29 22:42:56	Marty2000	Yeah, it sounds quite different from a Pikmin music to me
2016-12-29 22:43:09	@Espyo	oh, we had already pointed down that all story mode gates take 24-28
2016-12-29 22:43:24	Yoshi2	I'm turning the sound fines from the game into a sound font and I'm currently at 16 out of 53 instruments, but of those 16 most are higher/lower pitched duplicates
2016-12-29 22:43:50	@Espyo	right
