2016-08-04 18:24:28	@PikFan	ooh, seeing your name reminds me:
2016-08-04 18:24:37	@PikFan	I finally learned how to play chess a few days ago
2016-08-04 18:24:44	@PikFan	I'm terrible at it lol
2016-08-04 18:24:48	En_Passant	Wait, you didn't know how?
2016-08-04 18:24:55	@PikFan	nope
2016-08-04 18:24:58	@PikFan	never learned
2016-08-04 18:25:01	En_Passant	lmao
2016-08-04 18:25:51	En_Passant	I don't come here very often any more...
2016-08-04 18:26:27	@PikFan	oh, you come here more often than some users
2016-08-04 18:26:40	@PikFan	(too bad LoganPikmin is still very active)
2016-08-04 18:26:55	@PikFan	((can't wait for the day he vanishes from the website))
2016-08-04 18:27:06	En_Passant	Yeah, and more often than the people who seem to be eternally idling here lol
2016-08-04 18:27:26	@PikFan	indeed
2016-08-04 18:27:38	En_Passant	But not as often as I used to
2016-08-04 18:27:47	@PikFan	*cough*RingtailedFox*cough*smuckola*cough*
2016-08-04 18:27:52	@PikFan	who are those guys anyway
2016-08-04 18:27:56	@PikFan	they never talk here
2016-08-04 18:28:45	Marty2000	Hi En_Passant
2016-08-04 18:30:33	En_Passant	o/
2016-08-04 18:30:49	Marty2000	Heh, figured out En_Passant was from chess
2016-08-04 18:31:03	En_Passant	Seems everyone is learning about chess today
2016-08-04 18:31:05	Yoshi2	RingtailedFox sometimes talks if you ping him at the right moment
2016-08-04 18:31:14	Marty2000	I know how to play chess :p
2016-08-04 18:31:18	Marty2000	Oh, really?
2016-08-04 18:31:30	Marty2000	Good to know, because I've never seen him talk since I'm here :p
2016-08-04 18:31:35	En_Passant	Okay, let's ping him every five minutes
2016-08-04 18:31:40	Marty2000	okay
2016-08-04 18:31:42	En_Passant	One of them will be "the right moment"
2016-08-04 18:32:00	Yoshi2	J is J, Miles_ is Miles_, M6 seems to be often away though even though he has a !def function set up
2016-08-04 18:32:15	RingtailedFox	you mean like right now? :P
2016-08-04 18:32:20	Yoshi2	^
2016-08-04 18:32:29	Yoshi2	PikFan: see? :P
2016-08-04 18:32:29	RingtailedFox	what's on your mind, Yoshi2 ?
2016-08-04 18:32:40	@PikFan	yay
2016-08-04 18:32:43	Marty2000	Oh
2016-08-04 18:32:50	Marty2000	Nice to meet you RingtailedFox :p
2016-08-04 18:32:56	RingtailedFox	it's nice to meet you guys too

2016-08-04 21:54:07	@PikFan	hi Scruffy
2016-08-04 21:54:37	Scruffy	I'm pretty hyped this week
2016-08-04 21:55:04	Scruffy	PFE update, Olympic Games, and No Man's Sky come out so soon!
2016-08-04 21:55:26	@PikFan	I could care less about the Olympic Games tbh
2016-08-04 21:55:56	@Espyo	about the update...
2016-08-04 21:56:08	@Espyo	it's a bit demoralizing when you plop all of the new enemies and obstacles on the Play map
2016-08-04 21:56:10	@Espyo	go for a whirl
2016-08-04 21:56:14	@Espyo	and uncover like 15 bugs in a row
2016-08-04 21:56:27	@Espyo	I'll leave most of them unfixed, since they're situational or not very important
2016-08-04 21:56:41	@Espyo	but I'll try to fix most today and tomorrow, so I can release it tomorrow and spend Saturday updating the wiki
2016-08-04 21:56:54	Neocraftz1553	Maybe make 2 maps, later?
2016-08-04 21:57:18	Neocraftz1553	For the update that lets you choose areas on a world map, y'know
2016-08-04 21:57:30	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-04 21:57:40	@Espyo	I might make Mission Mode before making the world map
2016-08-04 21:57:45	@Espyo	since the world map comes with story-stuff
2016-08-04 21:57:48	@Espyo	which will be one full beast
2016-08-04 21:58:01	@Espyo	I'm planning on making one map that jumbles almost all features together, for people to experiment with
2016-08-04 21:58:07	@Espyo	not very different from how Play currently is
2016-08-04 21:58:18	@Espyo	and then bundle one or more maps that work just like the Pikmin 3 missions
2016-08-04 21:58:29	@Espyo	so people can experiment or play seriously
2016-08-04 21:58:36	@Espyo	without having to create anything
2016-08-04 21:59:13	Neocraftz1553	Ah, sounds awsome
2016-08-04 22:00:00	Scruffy	Well more power to you Espyo
2016-08-04 22:00:26	Scruffy	Yesterday I tried to design a 3D Mario game in 2.5-D Little Big Planet 3
2016-08-04 22:00:37	Scruffy	I know what you mean by demoralizing test
2016-08-04 22:00:39	Yoshi2	PikFan: if you could care less then that means you still care
2016-08-04 22:00:51	@PikFan	shhhhhh
2016-08-04 22:00:56	@Espyo	yikes, yeah
2016-08-04 22:00:58	Scruffy	I booted it up today and LittleBigPlanet didn't even remember that I started it
2016-08-04 22:01:07	Scruffy	I had to start from scratch
2016-08-04 22:01:10	Scruffy	And I know I saved it
2016-08-04 22:01:12	@Espyo	what, really?
2016-08-04 22:01:43	Scruffy	It's okay, I know the third installment is just glitchy because the rights were handed off after the second
2016-08-04 22:01:58	Scruffy	But at least that allowed me to realize what was wrong with my first try
2016-08-04 22:02:07	@Espyo	well, at least
2016-08-04 22:02:09	Scruffy	I now have a working 3D Mario and coin asset to collect
2016-08-04 22:02:51	@Espyo	how far can you customize the assets?
2016-08-04 22:02:55	@Espyo	can you draw them freely?
2016-08-04 22:03:15	Scruffy	You can paint textures, and draw physical objects
2016-08-04 22:03:21	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-08-04 22:03:24	Scruffy	But things can only /rotate/ so many ways
2016-08-04 22:03:30	@Espyo	you mean joints?
2016-08-04 22:03:46	Scruffy	I mean axes of rotation
2016-08-04 22:03:58	Scruffy	There's x, but you have to fake y and z
2016-08-04 22:04:03	@Espyo	blegh
2016-08-04 22:04:38	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy and Neocraftz1553
2016-08-04 22:04:49	Scruffy	And LittleBigPlanet 3 gives you tools that suggest they want you to get past their 2.5-D landscape
2016-08-04 22:04:56	Scruffy	But they didn't have to make it so difficult :/
2016-08-04 22:05:23	@Espyo	yeah, that does sound weird
2016-08-04 22:05:27	@Espyo	sounds unfinished
2016-08-04 22:05:35	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 22:05:43	Scruffy	If you're going to get any of them, get the second
2016-08-04 22:06:04	Scruffy	Media Molecule knew what they were doing, the whole design of the creation engine is intuitive and pretty fun to use
2016-08-04 22:06:15	Scruffy	Actually strike that
2016-08-04 22:06:29	Scruffy	If you're going to get any of them, wait for Media Molecule to come out with Dreams
2016-08-04 22:06:44	Scruffy	Which basically turns a PS4 into a game creating system
2016-08-04 22:07:01	Neocraftz1553	Hey Marty
2016-08-04 22:07:15	@Espyo	haha, that's awesome
2016-08-04 22:07:19	@Espyo	but it's not out yet, right?
2016-08-04 22:07:21	@Espyo	sooooo it could be trash
2016-08-04 22:07:26	Scruffy	Right...
2016-08-04 22:07:35	Scruffy	From the trailers I've seen, it looks pretty powerful'
2016-08-04 22:07:45	Scruffy	Modelling is volumetric, rather than vertex-based
2016-08-04 22:07:45	@Espyo	I'm afraid we can't really trust trailers nowadays...
2016-08-04 22:07:51	Scruffy	So it's like molding with clay
2016-08-04 22:07:55	@Espyo	hmm... so it's like m--
2016-08-04 22:07:58	@Espyo	wow, yeah, that
2016-08-04 22:08:04	@Espyo	(also isn't it "moulding"?)
2016-08-04 22:08:26	Scruffy	The Americans kicked out a lot of "ou"'s
2016-08-04 22:08:44	@Espyo	a regional thing? I could swear that...
2016-08-04 22:08:45	Scruffy	colour became color, moulding became molding, behaviour became etc.
2016-08-04 22:09:00	@Espyo	even in the US, it's "mould" when you want "shaping", and "mold" when you want "yucky biological thingy"
2016-08-04 22:09:17	Scruffy	I've seen both in the US actually
2016-08-04 22:09:21	@Espyo	so you're telling me that in the US, "mold" means both the biological thing and the act of shaping?
2016-08-04 22:09:25	Scruffy	yes
2016-08-04 22:09:40	@Espyo	I've been slapped in the face so many times by realizing that I was using mold wrong
2016-08-04 22:09:43	@Espyo	turns out I've been using it right
2016-08-04 22:09:46	@Espyo	damn regional differences...
2016-08-04 22:09:51	Scruffy	So molding clay could either be the act of shaping it or clay that has sat out way too long
2016-08-04 22:09:59	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-08-04 22:10:18	Neocraftz1553	Hah
2016-08-04 22:11:02	Scruffy	The only problem I see with Dreams is that it uses the "Playstation Move"
2016-08-04 22:11:20	Scruffy	Which from what I can tell is a Wii Remote ripoff that is a bit harder to handle
2016-08-04 22:11:29	@Espyo	yikes
2016-08-04 22:11:30	Scruffy	And this game requires that you use one in each hand
2016-08-04 22:11:52	@Espyo	for both playing and editing?
2016-08-04 22:12:22	Scruffy	I don't know about playing, I think you can map controls to a regular controller (you could do the same in LittleBigPlanet 2 and 3)
2016-08-04 22:12:59	Scruffy	But editing requires both, either as sculpting tools or for one to hold a menu and the other to select things
2016-08-04 22:13:26	@Espyo	sounds convoluted
2016-08-04 22:13:28	Scruffy	Testers have said it's ergonomical, but I'm worried about getting the hang of it
2016-08-04 22:13:41	@Espyo	although I guess it must be a lot easier to draw with that, compared to using an analog stick
2016-08-04 22:13:51	Scruffy	That's true
2016-08-04 22:14:17	@Espyo	the little voices inside me tell me to just mindlessly bash on weird stuff game devs pull out
2016-08-04 22:14:30	@Espyo	good thing I drown that out with at least some thoughts of "let's give it a chance"

2016-08-04 22:15:05	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 22:17:08	Scruffy	At least the music composition tool is consistent in LBP3
2016-08-04 22:17:18	Scruffy	I saved a piece of music and that didn't get lost
2016-08-04 22:18:40	Scruffy	oh, PikFan or Neo or Marty, any ideas on that open-world fan game idea we had a few days ago?
2016-08-04 22:19:40	@Espyo	nice
2016-08-04 22:19:48	@Espyo	still sucks that you lost the rest
2016-08-04 22:19:51	@Espyo	it makes no sense for that to happen
2016-08-04 22:19:54	@Espyo	but at least something remained
2016-08-04 22:19:58	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 22:20:11	Scruffy	And I've made most of the progress back
2016-08-04 22:20:13	@PikFan	not really, no
2016-08-04 22:20:17	Scruffy	I didn't get very far :P
2016-08-04 22:20:26	@PikFan	BUT
2016-08-04 22:20:28	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User:Wraith/Status_Reel&curid=6340&diff=54310&oldid=40082
2016-08-04 22:20:31	Neocraftz1553	Not much here :|
2016-08-04 22:20:44	@PikFan	I can't help but feel that Wraith's idea is also open world :P
2016-08-04 22:20:53	Scruffy	Yeah, heh
2016-08-04 22:21:37	@Espyo	...I need a QC department
2016-08-04 22:21:50	@Espyo	just found out that if you're holding a Pikmin and an enemy knocks you out of it, the Pikmin stays stuck
2016-08-04 22:22:11	Yoshi2	Espyo: do you need a department that finds the bugs, or that fixes it
2016-08-04 22:22:18	@Espyo	QC finds them
2016-08-04 22:22:37	@Espyo	I'm the fixer
2016-08-04 22:23:14	Scruffy	What normally happens in Pikmin games in that situation?
2016-08-04 22:23:25	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure the leader is hurt, but gently drops the Pikmin
2016-08-04 22:23:28	Scruffy	I know the Pikmin is invincible in P3
2016-08-04 22:23:30	@Espyo	as if you had swapped out that Pikmin for another
2016-08-04 22:23:51	@Espyo	yeah...isn't that how you get the invincible Pikmin glitch in P3?
2016-08-04 22:23:57	Scruffy	yeah
2016-08-04 22:24:05	@Espyo	oh, no, it's when you let the Pikmin get killed and grab it at the same time
2016-08-04 22:24:06	@Espyo	right?
2016-08-04 22:24:39	Scruffy	You just have to grab it
2016-08-04 22:24:43	Scruffy	It cannot be hurt
2016-08-04 22:24:54	Scruffy	If the leader is hurt it will drop the Pikmin
2016-08-04 22:25:10	Scruffy	The Pikmin will squeal if bitten, but it won't get eaten at all
2016-08-04 22:25:15	Scruffy	That's hilarious
2016-08-04 22:25:27	@Espyo	so, to get the glitch, you just let your leader get hurt while they're carrying a Pikmin?!
2016-08-04 22:25:36	@Espyo	I could swear that it was the other method I said...
2016-08-04 22:25:41	Neocraftz1553	Heh, Scruffy
2016-08-04 22:26:55	Scruffy	They're only invincible while being held though
2016-08-04 22:27:11	@Espyo	oh!
2016-08-04 22:27:14	@Espyo	I see what's up
2016-08-04 22:27:17	@Espyo	there's two different glitches
2016-08-04 22:27:23	@Espyo	one is how Pikmin are invincible while held
2016-08-04 22:27:30	@Espyo	and yeah, they squeal if they're bitten, but nothing happens
2016-08-04 22:27:30	Marty2000	;)
2016-08-04 22:27:46	@Espyo	another glitch is you grabbing a Pikmin at the same time it was meant to be killed
2016-08-04 22:27:51	@Espyo	which makes the Pikmin live and become invincible forever
2016-08-04 22:28:04	Scruffy	Ah
2016-08-04 22:28:07	@Espyo	...the hell is this spaghetti code I wrote?
2016-08-04 22:28:15	@Espyo	leaders are in charge of notifying the Pikmin that they got released
2016-08-04 22:28:26	@Espyo	...but the Pikmin are the ones in charge of notifying the leader that they need to be released
2016-08-04 22:28:32	@Espyo	this is an egg vs chicken situation right here
2016-08-04 22:28:37	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 22:28:38	@Espyo	how did this ever work?!
2016-08-04 22:29:35	Scruffy	Maybe the leader should be in charge of both?
2016-08-04 22:29:43	@Espyo	yeah, I don't know why it's not
2016-08-04 22:29:47	@Espyo	but past me definitely knew...
2016-08-04 22:32:41	@Espyo	oh, yeah, both need to be in charge of it
2016-08-04 22:32:50	Scruffy	How come?
2016-08-04 22:32:50	@Espyo	if an enemy snatches a Pikmin
2016-08-04 22:32:53	@Espyo	the leader doesn't know this information
2016-08-04 22:32:56	@Espyo	it needs to be told somehow
2016-08-04 22:32:57	Scruffy	Ah
2016-08-04 22:33:01	@Espyo	the Pikmin tells it
2016-08-04 22:33:17	@Espyo	and if the leader is hurt, it needs to release it and tell the Pikmin that it got released
2016-08-04 22:33:29	@Espyo	this "message" system is pretty powerful, but can get tricky sometimes
2016-08-04 22:33:44	Scruffy	Perhaps that's why in P3 the invincible grabbed Pikmin glitched exists
2016-08-04 22:34:01	@Espyo	I don't have a single doubt in my mind that that's why
2016-08-04 22:34:21	@Espyo	in fact, there's a funny thing I don't know if I told you
2016-08-04 22:34:41	@Espyo	I COMPLETELY understand why you can pluck a Pikmin and then cancel it instantly, and the Pikmin plucks itself, in Pikmin 3
2016-08-04 22:34:49	@Espyo	before, I thought that was stupid
2016-08-04 22:34:55	@Espyo	then I implemented my own plucking system
2016-08-04 22:35:00	@Espyo	and the EXACT SAME GLITCH happens too
2016-08-04 22:35:02	@Espyo	and I fully understand why
2016-08-04 22:35:04	@Espyo	what's more!
2016-08-04 22:35:10	@Espyo	I know exactly why they won't fix it
2016-08-04 22:35:23	@Espyo	when your leader begins plucking, it messages the Pikmin to go into its "get plucked" animation
2016-08-04 22:35:30	@Espyo	you have to give the player a way to cancel this
2016-08-04 22:35:31	Scruffy	right
2016-08-04 22:35:43	@Espyo	otherwise, the only time the player could cancel plucking is if they do it between walks from Pikmin 1 to Pikmin 2
2016-08-04 22:35:52	@Espyo	and if you have a bunch of Pikmin bundled together, the leader won't walk anywhere
2016-08-04 22:36:04	@Espyo	so the player would be forced to have them all plucked
2016-08-04 22:36:08	Scruffy	or if there's a stupid marble in the way
2016-08-04 22:36:13	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-08-04 22:36:15	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-08-04 22:36:20	@Espyo	that's why you can cancel at any time, but since the message to the Pikmin is already sent...
2016-08-04 22:36:26	@Espyo	it does its own thing, without needing the leader
2016-08-04 22:36:35	@Espyo	they could make it so the leader could send a "hey, stop being plucked" message
2016-08-04 22:36:44	@Espyo	which could run a new animation for the Pikmin to unstretch and get back to where it was
2016-08-04 22:36:50	@Espyo	but that'd just be overengineering
2016-08-04 22:37:41	Scruffy	And you're not really that obligated to leave Pikmin unplucked in P3
2016-08-04 22:37:51	Scruffy	Since idle leaders automatically pluck them
2016-08-04 22:37:53	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-04 22:39:52	Scruffy	That's neat that you could replicate the exact same situation in the engine
2016-08-04 22:40:11	@Espyo	I laughed pretty hard when I realized
2016-08-04 22:40:20	@Espyo	and it blew my mind, since I understood the devs so much more
2016-08-04 22:40:34	@Espyo	plus, how great of a motivation is it to know that your code is practically on-par with Nintendo masterminds?
2016-08-04 22:40:36	@Espyo	it feels pretty great
2016-08-04 22:40:44	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-08-04 22:41:34	Scruffy	Still, I thought it'd be pretty masterful to quietly slip in an "unplucking" animation and sound
2016-08-04 22:41:59	Scruffy	Maybe Pikmin 4 will give us that, if it matters
2016-08-04 22:42:16	Neocraftz1553	Its pretty minor, but maybe
2016-08-04 22:42:17	@Espyo	hehe
2016-08-04 22:42:28	@Espyo	well, next update, I'll focus on player experience
2016-08-04 22:42:34	@Espyo	and I plan on making plucking a lot faster
2016-08-04 22:42:43	@Espyo	so maybe I won't even need to think about the cancelling shenanigans
2016-08-04 22:43:18	Scruffy	I've recently been learning all about how video game animations are strung together
2016-08-04 22:43:18	@Espyo	oh, I think I see the problem
2016-08-04 22:43:25	Neocraftz1553	What about letting the player be able to set the plucking speeds of the different leaders?
2016-08-04 22:43:43	@Espyo	how so?
2016-08-04 22:43:45	Scruffy	Why wouldn't you set all of them to as fast as possible?
2016-08-04 22:43:48	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: yeah, I'll allow that
2016-08-04 22:43:59	Neocraftz1553	Ok
2016-08-04 22:44:07	Scruffy	brb
2016-08-04 22:44:08	@Espyo	I want to make a fangame myself, and I want my leaders to have slightly different characteristics
2016-08-04 22:44:13	@Espyo	stuff that won't matter to most players
2016-08-04 22:44:23	@Espyo	but can make a difference of 2 or 3 seconds if you're crazy good at mission mode
2016-08-04 22:44:38	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, I like tinkering with minor things like that
2016-08-04 22:45:07	Scruffy	oh sorry, i thought you meant giving the player that option :P
2016-08-04 22:45:09	Neocraftz1553	Captain speed, plucking, power, qnd health
2016-08-04 22:45:09	Scruffy	brb
2016-08-04 22:45:19	@Espyo	oh, heh
2016-08-04 22:45:29	@Espyo	speed and health can already be set individually
2016-08-04 22:45:34	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-08-04 22:45:38	@Espyo	but I'll customize plucking and punch power and such easily one day
2016-08-04 22:50:15	Neocraftz1553	By the way, Electric Dumplez everywhere
2016-08-04 22:52:54	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-04 22:53:33	Neocraftz1553	What do they do?
2016-08-04 22:53:48	@Espyo	they act just like normal Water Dumples
2016-08-04 22:53:54	@Espyo	except they first try to zap their victims
2016-08-04 22:53:59	@Espyo	with stunning electricity
2016-08-04 22:54:05	Neocraftz1553	Shocking.
2016-08-04 22:54:05	@Espyo	then, they go forward for a bite
2016-08-04 22:54:34	Neocraftz1553	Mhmm
2016-08-04 22:54:46	Neocraftz1553	Oh, like the... errr
2016-08-04 22:55:02	@Espyo	Bearded Amprat?
2016-08-04 22:55:40	Neocraftz1553	Yeah
2016-08-04 22:55:54	Neocraftz1553	Gosh, my Pikmin vocabulary is slipping
2016-08-04 22:56:05	@Espyo	hah
2016-08-04 22:56:08	@Espyo	yeah, more or less like it
2016-08-04 22:58:41	Scruffy	back
2016-08-04 22:58:52	Neocraftz1553	Welcome back
2016-08-04 22:59:28	Scruffy	thanks
2016-08-04 23:01:19	Scruffy	I just recalled something while viewing the Glitches in Pikmin 3 page
2016-08-04 23:02:11	Scruffy	In the glitch where you trap Pikmin carrying the Crimson Banquet in a loading zone by blocking the path with the Sandbelching Meerslug body
2016-08-04 23:02:36	Scruffy	I think that happened to me once where the Pikmin just got stuck carrying the Meerslug, I couldn't whistle any of them
2016-08-04 23:03:08	Scruffy	And I didn't lose any Pikmin, but on the following day, not all of the Crimson Banquet pieces were in their original spot, only some of them
2016-08-04 23:03:50	Scruffy	I feel like I remember coming across 5 of the 6 parts of the fruit, and the last piece was in the Shaggy Long Legs arena
2016-08-04 23:04:15	Scruffy	I just remember suddenly finding the last chunk in the Shaggy Long Legs arena, for sure
2016-08-04 23:06:30	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-04 23:06:48	@Espyo	I think a glitch like that is already there too, more or less
2016-08-04 23:08:06	Scruffy	yeah, the article sums it up well, it's just weird how unpredictable it is
2016-08-04 23:08:16	@Espyo	yeha
2016-08-04 23:08:17	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-08-04 23:08:27	@Espyo	<Scruffy> I've recently been learning all about how video game animations are strung together
2016-08-04 23:08:29	@Espyo	can you elaborate?
2016-08-04 23:09:06	Scruffy	oh, in LittleBigPlanet they literally give you all the animations they've made for the characters you play as
2016-08-04 23:09:23	Scruffy	So you can animate them however you wish within the bounds of stringing those together
2016-08-04 23:09:39	Scruffy	And it got me researching how vg animations work altogether
2016-08-04 23:10:00	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-04 23:10:04	Scruffy	such as how animations form a hierarchy and blend with each other
2016-08-04 23:10:11	@Espyo	it's a really complex thing
2016-08-04 23:10:14	@Espyo	simple animations are... simple
2016-08-04 23:10:20	@Espyo	like on the engine, where it's just a sequence of frames
2016-08-04 23:10:24	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-04 23:10:24	@Espyo	but more complex stuff can get insane
2016-08-04 23:10:28	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-04 23:10:37	@Espyo	I only understand the concepts, but wouldn't even know where to begin if I wanted to actually implement them
2016-08-04 23:10:48	Scruffy	Same here
2016-08-04 23:11:18	Scruffy	i know if I wanted to, I could design a character in Blender, create looping animations in Blender, and export the model and animation data to Unity
2016-08-04 23:11:35	@Espyo	I only recently learned what the name is of that mechanic where your character's feet stick to the ground and the knees bend the right way: inverse kinematics
2016-08-04 23:11:39	Scruffy	But stringing them together, and optimizing them for stringing, is a different, more convoluted story
2016-08-04 23:11:44	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-04 23:11:48	Scruffy	Oh yeah
2016-08-04 23:11:53	Scruffy	It's useful, but very finicky
2016-08-04 23:12:20	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-08-04 23:12:36	Scruffy	Take a look at this picture, from the Greninja Smash Wii U trailer
2016-08-04 23:12:41	Scruffy	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:RedPikminGreninjaTrailer.PNG
2016-08-04 23:13:03	Scruffy	notice anything wrong with the Red Pikmin, who's flying through the air?
2016-08-04 23:13:15	@Espyo	well, depends
2016-08-04 23:13:21	@Espyo	its nose is pretty dumb
2016-08-04 23:13:24	@Espyo	as it should be
2016-08-04 23:13:38	@Espyo	but in terms of physics, its stem isn't really angled down, and it should be
2016-08-04 23:13:40	Scruffy	It's just flopping in the wind, in the video that's intentional
2016-08-04 23:13:41	@Espyo	sorry, angled BACK
2016-08-04 23:13:48	Scruffy	True
2016-08-04 23:14:01	Scruffy	But something even worse
2016-08-04 23:14:09	Scruffy	That could be so easily avoided
2016-08-04 23:14:42	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-04 23:15:04	@Espyo	I can see a lot of tiny things, but I don't know if they're same you're thinking
2016-08-04 23:15:15	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 23:15:17	@Espyo	the leaf and the stem end in a single vertex, as if they're just held together magically
2016-08-04 23:15:20	@Espyo	the eyes aren't on the face
2016-08-04 23:15:24	Neocraftz1553	THAT WITCH NOSE
2016-08-04 23:15:33	@Espyo	it's totally a witch nose
2016-08-04 23:15:39	Scruffy	The main thing is that the leaf and the stem aren't connected
2016-08-04 23:15:49	@Espyo	right
2016-08-04 23:15:51	Scruffy	That's my main problem
2016-08-04 23:16:18	Neocraftz1553	https://ifunny.co/fun/PeD3GOF54?gallery=featured
2016-08-04 23:16:22	Scruffy	That means that they literally took the model of Red Pikmin from Pikmin 3, added some subdivisions and bones in the nose, and stamped it ready
2016-08-04 23:16:50	Scruffy	I've seen it in Blender
2016-08-04 23:16:51	Neocraftz1553	Wait, so the leaves aren't  connecred?
2016-08-04 23:16:58	Scruffy	the leaf and the stem are different objects
2016-08-04 23:17:21	Scruffy	With lower amounts of polygons, the stem makes it to the leaf because the end of it is sharper
2016-08-04 23:17:22	Neocraftz1553	When I use the models, I usually put the leaf in rhe stem :|
2016-08-04 23:17:51	Scruffy	But subdivide it, and the stem is too smooth to reach the leaf
2016-08-04 23:18:09	Scruffy	It would take a second to just move the leaf down a little on the model's skeleton
2016-08-04 23:18:15	@Espyo	yikes, yeah
2016-08-04 23:18:18	Scruffy	But I guess they didn't notice it :P
2016-08-04 23:18:28	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-08-04 23:18:37	@Espyo	I think that scene happens pretty quickly anyway
2016-08-04 23:18:43	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-04 23:18:45	Neocraftz1553	Or they thought it a minor detail
2016-08-04 23:19:00	Scruffy	It's all I see in the trailer now though
2016-08-04 23:19:25	Scruffy	It's well-made, just that one slip
2016-08-04 23:19:55	Scruffy	Normally Nintendo's cinematic cutscenes don't have errors like that, that's the only reason I noticed it
2016-08-04 23:20:25	Scruffy	Then again, the artists from Pikmin probably didn't handle this cutscene
2016-08-04 23:20:29	@Espyo	hm, yeah...
2016-08-04 23:20:50	@Espyo	well, if your sudivision theory is true
2016-08-04 23:20:56	@Espyo	then they likely used the Smash 3DS Pikmin model
2016-08-04 23:21:01	@Espyo	...which is made of like 8 triangles
2016-08-04 23:21:08	Neocraftz1553	Thats justa theory....
2016-08-04 23:21:11	@Espyo	those things are serio-- wait, aren't they SPRITES on the 3DS?
2016-08-04 23:21:13	Neocraftz1553	A BLENDER theory
2016-08-04 23:21:24	Scruffy	No, they're models on the 3DS
2016-08-04 23:21:33	Neocraftz1553	Yessssss
2016-08-04 23:21:39	Scruffy	the 3DS is powerful
2016-08-04 23:21:51	Scruffy	too powerful to fall into the wrong hands!!!
2016-08-04 23:21:54	Neocraftz1553	So most games now have models on the 3DS?
2016-08-04 23:21:58	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-04 23:22:08	Neocraftz1553	What about Tri force heros
2016-08-04 23:22:13	Scruffy	I mean, the DS could handle models too...
2016-08-04 23:22:20	@Espyo	mhm
2016-08-04 23:24:31	Scruffy	Tri force Heroes also uses models
2016-08-04 23:25:08	@PikFan	I don't feel like reading through the wall of text, so can someone sum up the discussion? :P
2016-08-04 23:25:14	@Espyo	several discussions
2016-08-04 23:25:28	@Espyo	I think it's easier to count the 3DS games that DON'T use models
2016-08-04 23:25:34	@PikFan	sum up the several discussions, then
2016-08-04 23:25:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 23:26:00	Neocraftz1553	Tri force heros with models, models on 3DS, witch red pikmin, pikmin plucking coding
2016-08-04 23:26:17	@PikFan	...I see
2016-08-04 23:26:24	@Espyo	hurray, fixed
2016-08-04 23:26:28	@PikFan	that was a very bare-bones summary lol
2016-08-04 23:26:42	@Espyo	...getting an enemy to hit you without hitting a Pikmin is like treading a needle
2016-08-04 23:26:57	@Espyo	*threading
2016-08-04 23:27:15	Scruffy	Espyo explained how the Pikmin engine helped him realize how the Pikmin 3 pluck-cancelling trick worked
2016-08-04 23:27:54	Scruffy	Then he explained how the Electric Dumple in the game worked (shocks Pikmin then tries to eat them)
2016-08-04 23:28:13	Neocraftz1553	Then I forgot the Bearded Amprat
2016-08-04 23:28:18	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 23:28:38	@Espyo	ok, I'm in a bit of a pickle with hazard invulnerability...
2016-08-04 23:28:46	@Espyo	I need to have a period where Pikmin are invulnerable to hazards
2016-08-04 23:28:51	Scruffy	Then I recalled I lost a piece of Crimson Banquet in the Tropical Wilds once, and randomly found it in the Shaggy Long Legs arena
2016-08-04 23:28:58	@Espyo	this is because if they walk into, say, a gas pipe's gases, they'll be affected by it
2016-08-04 23:29:11	Neocraftz1553	Wtf https://ifunny.co/fun/gRgmX3L54
2016-08-04 23:29:14	@Espyo	if you whistle them, they'll be on the whistle and on the gas at the same time
2016-08-04 23:29:21	@Espyo	and instantly toggle between whistled (safe) and choking
2016-08-04 23:29:29	@Espyo	which makes them swap between states back and forth
2016-08-04 23:29:32	@Espyo	which isn't critical, but is dumb
2016-08-04 23:29:39	@Espyo	an invulnerability period fixes this
2016-08-04 23:29:45	Neocraftz1553	Ah, I see
2016-08-04 23:29:55	@Espyo	...problem is, players can exploit this period to have, for instance, Red Pikmin attack an electric gate
2016-08-04 23:30:08	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: it's Shrek
2016-08-04 23:30:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 23:30:09	@Espyo	nuff said
2016-08-04 23:30:14	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-08-04 23:30:17	@Espyo	anyway, I can't come up with any alternative...
2016-08-04 23:30:18	Scruffy	The same problem happens in P2
2016-08-04 23:30:23	@Espyo	what?!
2016-08-04 23:30:25	Scruffy	You can get Pikmin by a poison gate
2016-08-04 23:30:30	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-08-04 23:30:38	Scruffy	Heh, not with electricity
2016-08-04 23:30:45	@Espyo	yeah, because *bzzt*
2016-08-04 23:30:53	@Espyo	but you can't harm the poison gate anyway...
2016-08-04 23:30:56	@Espyo	hm, I guess that...
2016-08-04 23:31:08	@Espyo	oh, if I say that the gate's hitboxes also have an electricity hazard
2016-08-04 23:31:09	Neocraftz1553	I killed hundreds of pikmin with an electric fence
2016-08-04 23:31:14	@Espyo	only Pikmin immune to that can cause damage
2016-08-04 23:31:27	Scruffy	That works
2016-08-04 23:31:30	@Espyo	ugh
2016-08-04 23:31:37	@Espyo	worst part is, I thought about this a long time ago
2016-08-04 23:31:39	@Espyo	back when I made animations
2016-08-04 23:31:54	@Espyo	since I made it possible for not only attack hitboxes to have a hazard, but for damageable hitboxes to have them too
2016-08-04 23:31:56	@Espyo	I foresaw this
2016-08-04 23:31:58	@Espyo	and then I forgot...
2016-08-04 23:32:06	@Espyo	well, in my defense, I was pretty tired yesterday, when I found this problem
2016-08-04 23:32:12	@Espyo	and only now go to really think about it :P
2016-08-04 23:32:23	Scruffy	Maybe that's why poison is no longer in P3
2016-08-04 23:32:31	Scruffy	They realized you can get past it like that
2016-08-04 23:32:43	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-04 23:32:43	Neocraftz1553	Yeah, but that sucks
2016-08-04 23:32:47	Neocraftz1553	Brb
2016-08-04 23:32:49	Scruffy	So they only included small blasts of hazards like water jets or fire geysers
2016-08-04 23:32:52	<--	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@216.4.sx.gui) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-08-04 23:33:10	Scruffy	So they didn't have to worry about the whistle/hazard problem
2016-08-04 23:33:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-04 23:33:29	@Espyo	a bit of way to dance around the problem, but it's smart
2016-08-04 23:33:52	Scruffy	In fact, there's no longer any breakable hazard obstacles besides electric gates
2016-08-04 23:33:59	Scruffy	And those weren't a problem in P2
2016-08-04 23:34:10	@Espyo	right
2016-08-04 23:34:30	Scruffy	Man, it may be dancing around, but this game was really smart
2016-08-04 23:34:30	@Espyo	and in P3, they throw the Pikmin back, which, combined with the time it takes to get up, is more than enough time for the invulnerability period to wear off
2016-08-04 23:34:36	@Espyo	it really was
2016-08-04 23:34:47	Scruffy	And now it's 3 years old!
2016-08-04 23:34:48	@Espyo	it's sad that not many people can see that because they don't look deep enough
2016-08-04 23:34:55	@Espyo	or have the know-how to understand these sort of mechanics
2016-08-04 23:34:55	@Espyo	but
2016-08-04 23:34:59	@Espyo	I guess you can say that about a lot of games, huh
2016-08-04 23:35:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 23:35:17	@Espyo	it's not always about how this or that gimmicky feature works well
2016-08-04 23:35:32	@Espyo	or about how this or that normal thing is well-detailed
2016-08-04 23:35:45	@Espyo	it's also about the ingenuity of fixing insane problems that only game devs face
2016-08-04 23:35:56	Scruffy	Perhaps you could make it so that the only thing that Pikmin can do while recovering from a hazard is escape the hazard
2016-08-04 23:36:01	@Espyo	which reminds me of one of my favorite Gamasutra articles of all time
2016-08-04 23:36:07	Scruffy	A state for "escaping hazard"
2016-08-04 23:36:13	@Espyo	http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/194772/dirty_game_development_tricks.php
2016-08-04 23:36:26	@Espyo	yeah, that could work
2016-08-04 23:36:28	@Espyo	but it'd be limiting
2016-08-04 23:36:34	@Espyo	I couldn't make them be dismissed, grabbed, etc.
2016-08-04 23:36:40	@Espyo	which probably wouldn't be for the worst
2016-08-04 23:36:59	@Espyo	as a bit of punishment for letting it happen, you become unable to control them the normal way for one second
2016-08-04 23:37:01	@Espyo	(or more)
2016-08-04 23:37:08	@Espyo	you can only guide them, and nothing else
2016-08-04 23:37:13	@Espyo	yeah, I'll try to work that in
2016-08-04 23:37:25	@Espyo	but it might have a lot of specific cases I'm not seeing that'll make it weird
2016-08-04 23:37:36	@Espyo	like if you have some normal Pikmin with you, and you have some in the "escaping" state
2016-08-04 23:37:38	@Espyo	and you dismiss
2016-08-04 23:37:47	@Espyo	the normal ones will dismiss, the escapees will be with you
2016-08-04 23:39:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 23:39:41	Scruffy	That's true
2016-08-04 23:40:07	Scruffy	But if you had the state only occur while the Pikmin was still within the hitbox of the hazard...?
2016-08-04 23:40:21	Scruffy	You can't dismiss pikmin in poison, for example
2016-08-04 23:40:28	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-04 23:40:45	@Espyo	nah, it wouldn't be very easy to do
2016-08-04 23:40:52	@Espyo	it would for water, since the engine is able to detect when you enter AND leave water
2016-08-04 23:41:02	@Espyo	but for stuff like fire from a fire geyser, it's a thing that happens only on that gameplay event
2016-08-04 23:41:06	@Espyo	*gameplay frame
2016-08-04 23:41:11	Scruffy	right
2016-08-04 23:41:36	@Espyo	I'd have to fumble with the state machine to also be able to send a "started getting hit by a hazard hitbox" and "stopped getting hit by a hazard hitbox"
2016-08-04 23:41:37	Scruffy	so maybe only make it like .25 seconds
2016-08-04 23:41:40	@Espyo	plus they could mismatch
2016-08-04 23:41:40	-->	Neocraftz1553 (Mibbit@216.4.sx.gui) has joined #pikipedia
2016-08-04 23:41:46	Neocraftz1553	I am back 
2016-08-04 23:41:56	Scruffy	That article is hilarious by the way
2016-08-04 23:41:56	@Espyo	if you go from a fire geyser's hitbox to a poison gas's hitbox
2016-08-04 23:42:06	Neocraftz1553	Fill me in on what the conversations were about
2016-08-04 23:42:10	@Espyo	it would trigger the "stopped getting hit by hazard hitbox" event when you left the fire
2016-08-04 23:42:19	@Espyo	although it's still on a hazard hitbox — the poison gas
2016-08-04 23:42:26	@Espyo	and mixing invulnerabilities in the middle too...
2016-08-04 23:42:34	@Espyo	yeah, the simplest hotfix would be decreasing the time
2016-08-04 23:42:41	@Espyo	but on top of that, I'll go with the hitbox thing I said before
2016-08-04 23:43:01	@Espyo	if a hitbox says "I can only be damaged by Pikmin invulnerable to electricity", then try as you might to exploit the system, the game won't let you
2016-08-04 23:43:07	@Espyo	yeah, I love that article
2016-08-04 23:43:07	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-04 23:43:11	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 23:43:13	@Espyo	it's weird though, Gamasutra sometimes reposts it
2016-08-04 23:43:22	@Espyo	there I go, all excited, thinking there's a sequel to it
2016-08-04 23:43:26	@Espyo	and oh, it's still the same from 2013
2016-08-04 23:43:30	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 23:43:40	Neocraftz1553	Woah
2016-08-04 23:43:57	Scruffy	They just send it as a reminder to gamers who think the development business is simple
2016-08-04 23:44:25	Scruffy	That reminds me of a similar article I remember reading, though I don't know where, about design shortcuts in gaming
2016-08-04 23:44:26	@Espyo	heh, guess so
2016-08-04 23:44:32	Scruffy	Bethesda is the best at it
2016-08-04 23:44:38	@Espyo	oh, I think I know what you mean
2016-08-04 23:44:45	@Espyo	with uh...
2016-08-04 23:44:51	Scruffy	in Skyrim most of their tables are bookshelf models pushed into the ground
2016-08-04 23:44:56	@Espyo	some object just secretly being a tall object under-- yeah, that's it!
2016-08-04 23:45:03	@Espyo	that's hilarious, I love it
2016-08-04 23:45:11	@Espyo	it makes you feel dirty AND clever for doing it
2016-08-04 23:45:30	Scruffy	And their lack of vehicle programming is made up for by an invisible person wearing a "car" hat that runs underneath the ground
2016-08-04 23:45:38	@Espyo	hehehehe, yeah
2016-08-04 23:45:39	Scruffy	That one was the best
2016-08-04 23:45:51	@Espyo	makes me think
2016-08-04 23:45:56	@Espyo	I don't have enough shortcuts on the engine
2016-08-04 23:45:58	@Espyo	I should fix that
2016-08-04 23:46:04	@Espyo	oh wait
2016-08-04 23:46:05	@Espyo	I kinda do
2016-08-04 23:46:18	@Espyo	Dwarf Red Bulborbs use the exact same spritesheet as Red Bulborbs
2016-08-04 23:46:21	Scruffy	There's even a rumor that the reason Space Invaders gets faster as you play is because defeating more enemies frees up more processing, but I don't believe that one
2016-08-04 23:46:23	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 23:46:46	@Espyo	and you can tell in-game since zooming in shows them being really high-quality, since the sprites in the spritesheet is much bigger than them
2016-08-04 23:46:53	@Espyo	and most enemies I made have their spritesheets be 1:1
2016-08-04 23:46:57	@Espyo	so they blur if you zoom-in
2016-08-04 23:46:58	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-04 23:47:02	Neocraftz1553	HAH, a car hat
2016-08-04 23:47:07	@Espyo	oh, yeah, that Space Invaders thing
2016-08-04 23:47:09	@Espyo	it seems plausible
2016-08-04 23:47:12	@Espyo	why don't you buy it?
2016-08-04 23:47:25	Scruffy	I don't have the system to play the original
2016-08-04 23:47:30	@Espyo	oh, no, I
2016-08-04 23:47:37	@Espyo	I mean why don't you buy into the rumour?
2016-08-04 23:47:39	@Espyo	:P
2016-08-04 23:47:49	Scruffy	Oh heh
2016-08-04 23:47:55	@Espyo	geez, now I feel dumb lol
2016-08-04 23:48:03	Scruffy	I feel that was a design choice of which the arcade cabinet was capable
2016-08-04 23:48:24	Scruffy	To me they added that in for difficulty, not as a coincidence
2016-08-04 23:48:44	@Espyo	maybe it's both
2016-08-04 23:48:54	@Espyo	during development, the game was much less optimized and heavier
2016-08-04 23:49:05	@Espyo	and they noticed that yeah, the less alien objects, the faster it ran
2016-08-04 23:49:11	@Espyo	and somebody decided they should make it a mechanic
2016-08-04 23:49:14	Scruffy	I guess that could be the case
2016-08-04 23:49:29	@Espyo	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch
2016-08-04 23:49:31	@Espyo	this thing, really
2016-08-04 23:49:32	Scruffy	It is one of the earliest video games, certainly they might've run into that
2016-08-04 23:49:52	@Espyo	honestly, the craziest things can make your game go super-slow
2016-08-04 23:49:56	@Espyo	I can't speak for an arcade machine
2016-08-04 23:50:03	Scruffy	Heh, that's actually a thing in little big planet
2016-08-04 23:50:20	Neocraftz1553	This is off topic, but...
2016-08-04 23:50:28	@Espyo	but on a home computer, under C++, having your list of objects have NAME identifiers instead of numbers makes it like 10 times slower
2016-08-04 23:50:37	Scruffy	So many people uploaded levels about exploits of the game, that the devs added "Glitch" as one of the options to describe a level you publish
2016-08-04 23:50:39	Neocraftz1553	People wanted Spicy boys, now Danger Noodles, and now Slippery Kids
2016-08-04 23:50:42	@Espyo	I actually almost quit the project because I figured it'd be too insanely slow without me being some optimization whizz
2016-08-04 23:50:51	@Espyo	then I just changed it to numbers, and suddenly, immense speed
2016-08-04 23:51:00	@Espyo	oh wow, that's bold
2016-08-04 23:51:14	@Espyo	having a "goofy" category or something is fine
2016-08-04 23:51:19	@Espyo	but glitch? man
2016-08-04 23:51:24	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: not all of those sound like foods
2016-08-04 23:51:28	@Espyo	are they foods?
2016-08-04 23:51:33	Neocraftz1553	Nope
2016-08-04 23:51:42	Scruffy	There's a petition to change the name of fire ants to those
2016-08-04 23:51:47	@Espyo	also, on the topic of crazy things making crazy optimizations: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25078285/replacing-a-32-bit-loop-count-variable-with-64-bit-introduces-crazy-performance?rq=1
2016-08-04 23:51:50	Neocraftz1553	Fire Ants, Snakes, and Salamanders, respectively 
2016-08-04 23:51:57	@Espyo	what
2016-08-04 23:51:59	@Espyo	internet, please
2016-08-04 23:52:04	Scruffy	It's ridiculous, but it went from meme-dome to actual petition
2016-08-04 23:52:11	Neocraftz1553	Yup
2016-08-04 23:52:16	Neocraftz1553	Danger Noodles
2016-08-04 23:52:41	@Espyo	couldn't it stay as a meme...?
2016-08-04 23:52:45	@Espyo	or
2016-08-04 23:52:49	@Espyo	we could just take it the opposite way
2016-08-04 23:52:52	@Espyo	and make everything named like that
2016-08-04 23:52:58	@Espyo	so it feels like Olimar named them like he names treasures
2016-08-04 23:53:16	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-04 23:53:20	Neocraftz1553	https://ifunny.co/fun/BhxFngK54
2016-08-04 23:53:28	Scruffy	I don't even think Olimar would name an animal like that Danger Noodles
2016-08-04 23:53:30	Neocraftz1553	Danger Noodles
2016-08-04 23:54:07	Neocraftz1553	Hah, Land Danger Noodles
2016-08-04 23:54:27	@Espyo	maybe not animals
2016-08-04 23:54:30	@Espyo	but everyday objects, sure
2016-08-04 23:54:30	Scruffy	There was a funny story about that Good Bad Bug thing in Little Big Planet 3 actually
2016-08-04 23:54:32	Neocraftz1553	I dont thing Olinar would name anything 'Spicy Boys"
2016-08-04 23:54:42	Scruffy	They left in a dummy texture they were planning to replace
2016-08-04 23:55:01	@Espyo	pfft
2016-08-04 23:55:14	Scruffy	But rather than release a patch with the actual texture, they didn't notice it for several patches
2016-08-04 23:55:15	@Espyo	yeah, Spicy Boys is pushing it
2016-08-04 23:55:54	Scruffy	And when they finally noticed, they realized it was too far in and instead released a free DLC t-shirt of the dummy texture
2016-08-04 23:56:06	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-08-04 23:56:23	Neocraftz1553	When something goes too far
2016-08-04 23:56:26	Scruffy	A nice gesture, but not a good excuse
2016-08-04 23:56:27	@Espyo	hehe
2016-08-04 23:56:45	Neocraftz1553	Spicy boys was the first one, then someone compared a snake to Ramen
2016-08-04 23:56:46	Scruffy	And I got it for free cause why not :D
2016-08-04 23:56:56	Neocraftz1553	Heh
2016-08-04 23:57:31	Neocraftz1553	Also, Danger noodles made me think of Cheepys quote on his user page
2016-08-04 23:59:06	Neocraftz1553	The Flying Spaghetti Monster boiled for our sins. R'amen.
2016-08-05 00:03:20	Neocraftz1553	Man, what if one day the Spicy boys, Danger Noodles, and Slippery Kids actually get named like that?
2016-08-05 00:04:56	Scruffy	I'm not going to hop on that bandwagon
2016-08-05 00:05:06	Scruffy	I like their original names
2016-08-05 00:07:43	Neocraftz1553	Yup, but, internet
2016-08-05 00:08:07	@Espyo	going to bed now
2016-08-05 00:08:07	@Espyo	night
2016-08-05 00:08:08	Scruffy	Woah, Espyo you were right
2016-08-05 00:08:17	Neocraftz1553	Night espyo
2016-08-05 00:08:29	@Espyo	hmm?
2016-08-05 00:08:36	Scruffy	They did leave in the processing problem of Space Invaders as a gameplay mechanic
2016-08-05 00:08:45	@Espyo	oh, is there a source?
2016-08-05 00:08:52	@Espyo	or is it just because the tvtropes page says so?
2016-08-05 00:09:03	@Espyo	I noticed it did, but since there's no source, I think it's still a rumor...
2016-08-05 00:09:33	Scruffy	It's also on Wikipedia and its sources

2016-08-05 18:50:19	Scruffy	That's because I have an interesting development
2016-08-05 18:50:23	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-08-05 18:50:28	Scruffy	I turned Pikmin 2 into a first-person game today
2016-08-05 18:50:29	@PikFan	oh?
2016-08-05 18:50:34	@PikFan	...what
2016-08-05 18:50:36	@PikFan	how
2016-08-05 18:50:46	@PikFan	...wow!
2016-08-05 18:50:53	Scruffy	There's a group of files that controls camera distance, angle, and FOV
2016-08-05 18:51:10	Scruffy	So I just gave the "zoom in to the captain" camera a negative distance
2016-08-05 18:51:20	@Espyo	hah!
2016-08-05 18:51:28	@PikFan	screenshots?
2016-08-05 18:51:34	Scruffy	And I had to remove the camera's collision detection
2016-08-05 18:51:41	@PikFan	I wanna see this now
2016-08-05 18:51:43	Scruffy	Sure, I'll upload them in just a sec
2016-08-05 18:51:49	@PikFan	sweeeeet
2016-08-05 18:51:59	Scruffy	It's not perfect, Olimar's geometry clips into the camera when you're moving
2016-08-05 18:52:03	Marty2000	Neat
2016-08-05 18:52:22	Scruffy	And since the camera has no collision avoidance, it flips upside down and refuses to work when you hit a wall
2016-08-05 18:52:38	Scruffy	Not to mention it's barely playable in this state :P
2016-08-05 18:52:45	@PikFan	lol wow
2016-08-05 18:52:54	Scruffy	It really makes you notice that Olimar couldn't even see half the treasures in the game
2016-08-05 18:52:56	@PikFan	Pikmin shooter game confirmed
2016-08-05 18:53:07	@PikFan	haha
2016-08-05 18:53:47	Scruffy	There are actually separate files for above ground and under ground cameras
2016-08-05 18:54:19	@PikFan	huh
2016-08-05 18:54:33	@PikFan	you'd think they'd be the same since it's just a camera
2016-08-05 18:54:38	@PikFan	that's pretty interesting
2016-08-05 18:54:46	@Espyo	wait, you managed to remove the camera's collision detection?
2016-08-05 18:54:54	 *	@PikFan adds that to the list of Pikmin 2's complexities
2016-08-05 18:54:55	Scruffy	Not collision detection, sorry
2016-08-05 18:54:59	Scruffy	Collision avoidance
2016-08-05 18:55:07	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-05 18:55:12	Scruffy	The camera tries to stay away from the wall and ground to avoid clipping
2016-08-05 18:55:39	Scruffy	Which messed up how close I could get the distance and angle to in front of Olimar instead of behind
2016-08-05 18:56:39	Scruffy	With collision avoidance on its normal setting, the camera would never go beyond Olimar; it would get infinitesimally close to Olimar's center, but no further
2016-08-05 18:56:46	Scruffy	...oddly enough

2016-08-05 19:13:11	Testyo	it's him and Harrison
2016-08-05 19:13:19	@PikFan	wait oh shit
2016-08-05 19:13:21	@PikFan	new spammers
2016-08-05 19:13:53	@PikFan	oh, Espyo got 'em already :P
2016-08-05 19:13:55	@Espyo	so I tried running the windows virtual machine I have to see if the engine is working on windows
2016-08-05 19:14:05	@Espyo	it started by rebooting itself instead of loading my save state
2016-08-05 19:14:08	@Espyo	so that's already fine
2016-08-05 19:14:16	@Espyo	but then I went to open visual studio there
2016-08-05 19:14:25	@Espyo	and apparently it decided that it was no longer a pirated version but instead a trial
2016-08-05 19:14:27	@Espyo	and didn't let me continue
2016-08-05 19:14:31	@Espyo	fuck this, I'm using my old laptop

2016-08-05 19:32:59	@Espyo	it failed to compile on windows

2016-08-05 19:48:23	@Espyo	but there are some demos on soundcloud on that thread
2016-08-05 19:48:26	@Espyo	and it's just amazing
2016-08-05 19:48:34	@Espyo	and it actually made me think...
2016-08-05 19:48:39	@Espyo	you know what, I'm NOT bad at swing notes
2016-08-05 19:49:06	Scruffy	heh, that's cool
2016-08-05 19:49:23	@Espyo	...I'm just bad at following them on a music with barely any rhythm to go by, and to follow up the arbitrary, short cues with my own inputs that must fit the imaginary grid of the swing notes
2016-08-05 19:50:15	Scruffy	Yeah, Love Rap is pretty minimalistic for a rhythm game
2016-08-05 19:52:47	@Espyo	ah well
2016-08-05 19:52:49	@Espyo	all over now
2016-08-05 19:56:49	@Espyo	no release this weekend
2016-08-05 19:56:54	@Espyo	it's freezing on windows
2016-08-05 19:57:08	@Espyo	and debugging on that thing is less comfortable than trying to remove my own organs with a fork
2016-08-05 19:57:16	@Espyo	this will DEFINITELY take a while
2016-08-05 19:57:28	Scruffy	Aww man, sorry to hear that
2016-08-05 19:58:34	@Espyo	I'm not in the least bit surprised

2016-08-05 20:16:25	@Espyo	now visual studio crashed while doing something basic
2016-08-05 20:16:34	@Espyo	plus the engine is crashing too, for no reason whatsoever
2016-08-05 20:16:52	@Espyo	I knew this would go poorly, but MAN

2016-08-05 20:17:55	Scruffy	Wait, it's crashing on linux or just windows?
2016-08-05 20:18:05	@Espyo	it's perfect on Linux
2016-08-05 20:19:30	Scruffy	Ah

2016-08-05 21:17:17	@Espyo	if I run it on a release build, it freezes whenever a mob changes state

2016-08-05 21:17:23	@Espyo	this is so peachy
2016-08-05 21:41:07	@Espyo	ok, I might've figured out why it's crashing at the start
2016-08-05 21:41:14	@Espyo	which is actually fair
2016-08-05 21:41:24	@Espyo	but doesn't justify it NOT crashing on a release build or on Linux

2016-08-05 23:35:52	@PikFan	it's... actually kinda fun
2016-08-05 23:38:48	@Espyo	oh?
2016-08-05 23:39:08	@PikFan	the goal is to try to kill people using only sprinklers
2016-08-05 23:39:18	@PikFan	and if someone kills you, you have to stay at spawn
2016-08-05 23:39:35	@PikFan	unless if a teammate kills someone with their sprinkler, in which case you're freed
2016-08-05 23:39:42	@PikFan	so it's like freeze tag, in a way
2016-08-05 23:39:57	@Espyo	hah
2016-08-05 23:39:59	@Espyo	that's pretty neat

2016-08-06 12:13:36	Yoshi2	earlier today I had a thing where I saved the stuff and it overwrote the entire iso file with 0's except for the data that I wrote
2016-08-06 12:13:40	Yoshi2	and the offsets were correct
2016-08-06 12:13:47	Yoshi2	so when I open it again, it seems fine
2016-08-06 12:13:59	Yoshi2	but when I open the iso with a hex editor, all data is poof
2016-08-06 12:14:28	Yoshi2	the reason? Don't open a binary file with mode "wb" if you want to edit the data
2016-08-06 12:14:39	Yoshi2	solution was opening it with "r+b"
2016-08-06 12:15:04	@Espyo	haha

2016-08-06 19:39:48	@Espyo	so many drawbacks yesterday and today
2016-08-06 19:39:51	@Espyo	but I managed to pull through
2016-08-06 19:39:57	@Espyo	what a relief
2016-08-06 19:40:03	@Espyo	and it doesn't look like there are any critical bugs
2016-08-06 19:40:25	Scruffy	Great
2016-08-06 19:43:17	@Espyo	hey, I don't know if I told you already, I think I have
2016-08-06 19:43:25	@Espyo	but I'm also getting the invisible JPG images problem on Wine under Linux
2016-08-06 19:43:31	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-08-06 19:43:46	Scruffy	Hi Marty
2016-08-06 19:43:49	Scruffy	Oh, that's interesting
2016-08-06 19:44:04	@Espyo	I'd bet it's a problem with the Allegro library itself
2016-08-06 19:44:08	@Espyo	I'll have to report it one day
2016-08-06 19:44:21	Scruffy	I've always just changed the files to .png and changed the game data to reflect that
2016-08-06 19:44:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-06 19:44:34	@Espyo	I'll make it possible to change more "fixed" files in the future
2016-08-06 19:44:47	@Espyo	like, the background for the main menu has a fixed filename, and it honestly shouldn't
2016-08-06 19:54:28	Scruffy	I love the Electric Water Dumple
2016-08-06 19:54:55	@Espyo	great!
2016-08-06 19:55:11	@Espyo	not having a canon counterpart to go with, it's very hard to see if it ended up okay or not
2016-08-06 19:55:31	@Espyo	zaps too quickly? doesn't reach far enough when it zaps? should the barbels be more squishy? etc.
2016-08-06 19:55:38	@Espyo	these were all questions in my head while making it
2016-08-06 19:55:59	Scruffy	I think the zapping move is fine
2016-08-06 19:56:07	Scruffy	A good length and animation
2016-08-06 19:56:25	@Espyo	I think so too
2016-08-06 19:56:36	@Espyo	its positioning probably isn't the best
2016-08-06 19:56:40	@Espyo	the area is a big mess as it is
2016-08-06 19:56:50	@Espyo	that's why I'm thinking of making more and better pre-packaged areas
2016-08-06 19:57:00	@Espyo	but hey, this one is the classic
2016-08-06 19:57:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-06 19:57:07	@Espyo	and only shows to demonstrate what the engine is about, really
2016-08-06 19:59:04	Scruffy	And the water is also great, it gets the point across really well
2016-08-06 19:59:24	@Espyo	I still feel like I can improve the water a lot, but everybody agrees it's great...
2016-08-06 19:59:32	@Espyo	might be creator bias
2016-08-06 19:59:35	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-06 19:59:50	@Espyo	well, let's just say that if I had to stop development of the engine right now, I wouldn't be sad about leaving that water in
2016-08-06 19:59:57	@Espyo	but for the future, I'll find some way to make it better
2016-08-06 19:59:59	Yoshi2	what does the water look like
2016-08-06 20:00:01	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-06 20:00:03	@Espyo	...one that doesn't involve shaders
2016-08-06 20:00:08	@Espyo	Yoshi2: lemme make a gif
2016-08-06 20:00:23	Scruffy	Also, I wanted to ask...
2016-08-06 20:00:41	Scruffy	not that this is a pressing issue, but would you want more sounds?
2016-08-06 20:00:47	Scruffy	I have a dump of Pikmin 2 sounds
2016-08-06 20:01:05	Scruffy	I could give you a few for enemy noises or extended Pikmin noises, if you so choose
2016-08-06 20:01:49	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-06 20:01:56	@Espyo	but I'm afraid I'll have to use non-copyrighted sounds
2016-08-06 20:02:01	Yoshi2	I wouldn't mind having the BMS files converted to midi :P 
2016-08-06 20:02:03	@Espyo	I don't want to risk it; the project's already too far in
2016-08-06 20:02:16	@Espyo	having it shut down because I use copyrighted assets would be horrible
2016-08-06 20:02:20	@Espyo	I can replace textures super easily
2016-08-06 20:02:28	@Espyo	I can replace the HUD without much problem
2016-08-06 20:02:34	@Espyo	sprites are already custom made
2016-08-06 20:02:39	@Espyo	but sounds... yeesh, those will be a pain
2016-08-06 20:02:43	Scruffy	Good call
2016-08-06 20:02:48	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-06 20:02:50	Yoshi2	make choo choo sounds
2016-08-06 20:02:56	@Espyo	I can replace some sound effects with stock ones, but Pikmin sounds... may have to do them with my mouth :V
2016-08-06 20:03:28	@Espyo	on that note, anybody that wants to help me get make custom sounds is more than welcome to help
2016-08-06 20:03:34	@Espyo	like, creating whistling sounds for the leaders
2016-08-06 20:03:38	@Espyo	I can just use a midi soundfont
2016-08-06 20:04:00	@Espyo	but if somebody has like a recording booth and a nice-sounding pea whistle and has the time to record a convincing whistle, that'd be beautiful
2016-08-06 20:04:09	@Espyo	also probably overkill, but still beautiful
2016-08-06 20:05:02	@Espyo	Yoshi2: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/engine_water.gif
2016-08-06 20:08:28	Scruffy	I don't have a pea whistle but I think I have a train whistle
2016-08-06 20:08:48	@Espyo	neat
2016-08-06 20:10:28	Scruffy	And it's not too hard to make Pikmin sounds: just say something slowly around middle C, then speed it up 400%
2016-08-06 20:11:10	@Espyo	I'll actually point that down
2016-08-06 20:11:16	@Espyo	I remember the research you made some weeks back with the sounds
2016-08-06 20:11:21	@Espyo	this is useful stuff
2016-08-06 20:11:39	Scruffy	I still keep forgetting to put it all together in a Youtube video
2016-08-06 20:11:52	@Espyo	well, take your time
2016-08-06 20:11:55	@Espyo	can't rush perfection, after all
2016-08-06 20:11:58	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-06 20:12:21	@Espyo	ouch, that sucks
2016-08-06 20:12:29	@Espyo	the global notice
2016-08-06 20:12:46	Scruffy	yeah

2016-08-07 16:55:57	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-07 16:56:10	@Espyo	...where's Testyo?
2016-08-07 16:56:10	Testyo	Staring at the computer.
2016-08-07 16:56:14	@Espyo	what
2016-08-07 16:56:23	@Espyo	I just tried to autocomplete his name and it didn't work
2016-08-07 16:56:27	@Espyo	and I missed him on the list of people
2016-08-07 16:56:30	@Espyo	either way...
2016-08-07 16:56:33	@Espyo	Testyo!...
2016-08-07 16:56:34	Testyo	Ben was the font file is upside down
2016-08-07 16:56:39	@Espyo	Testyo: Marty2000 is an alias of Marty
2016-08-07 16:56:39	Testyo	Done. Now I know that the nickname Marty2000 is an alias of Marty.
2016-08-07 16:56:44	@Espyo	you should've known that already...
2016-08-07 16:56:56	@Espyo	anyway, I've written a memo, and thought you'd receive it now, but you never
2016-08-07 16:57:05	Marty2000	No, never
2016-08-07 16:57:09	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-08-07 16:57:13	@Espyo	heh, it's not your fault
2016-08-07 16:57:26	@Espyo	can you try "Testyo memo 1", now that I've told him that "Marty2000" means "Marty"?
2016-08-07 16:57:27	Testyo	he needs to double check with an SQL injection that only works if you can impersonate another user
2016-08-07 16:57:28	Marty2000	Yeah, but sorry that you wrote something for nothing :p
2016-08-07 16:57:31	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-07 16:57:37	Marty2000	Testyo memo 1
2016-08-07 16:57:47	Marty2000	"You don't have any memos."

2016-08-07 16:58:08	@Espyo	bleh, screw it, then
2016-08-07 16:58:12	@Espyo	anyway, I found a pretty funny thing
2016-08-07 16:58:19	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-08-07 16:58:21	@Espyo	I tried to research more on the Scornet Maestro T-pose bug
2016-08-07 16:58:23	@Espyo	and did find something
2016-08-07 16:58:32	Marty2000	Cool, what is it?
2016-08-07 16:58:36	@Espyo	if you unpause the game with the Alph icon on the corner of the KopPad, it actually starts descending slowly
2016-08-07 16:58:38	@Espyo	still in a T-pose
2016-08-07 16:58:40	@Espyo	it's pretty funny
2016-08-07 16:58:47	@Espyo	but that's not the main funny thing
2016-08-07 16:58:48	Marty2000	Oh, nice
2016-08-07 16:58:53	@Espyo	while minding my own business
2016-08-07 16:59:07	@Espyo	I was controlling Alph, grabbed Brittany, and canceled the grab right away with a whistle
2016-08-07 16:59:10	@Espyo	this cut her sound short
2016-08-07 16:59:20	@Espyo	then I wondered what would happen if I grabbed her again and released over and over
2016-08-07 16:59:23	@Espyo	and I was in tears laughing
2016-08-07 16:59:35	Marty2000	Ha ha!
2016-08-07 16:59:36	@Espyo	she just does "oh-oh-oh-oh-wo-oh-wo-oh" sounds
2016-08-07 16:59:39	@Espyo	and they cancel so quickly
2016-08-07 16:59:41	@Espyo	you have to try it
2016-08-07 16:59:47	@Espyo	I wish I could record it
2016-08-07 16:59:50	@Espyo	it's so dumb, but so funny
2016-08-07 16:59:53	Marty2000	That's what I'm going to do
2016-08-07 16:59:59	@Espyo	:D
2016-08-07 17:00:03	Marty2000	... after I eat a breakfast, heh
2016-08-07 17:00:08	Marty2000	Can record it for you, if you'd like
2016-08-07 17:00:13	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-07 17:00:19	@Espyo	hm, breakfast... at this hour?
2016-08-07 17:00:22	Marty2000	Be right back in a few minutes
2016-08-07 17:00:29	@Espyo	shouldn't you be no more than 2 hours before me?
2016-08-07 17:00:36	@Espyo	should be around 15:00 for you
2016-08-07 17:00:42	Marty2000	Yeah, I messed up my sleep schedules a little
2016-08-07 17:00:45	@Espyo	ouch
2016-08-07 17:00:49	Marty2000	Eh, no, it's 18:00 for me
2016-08-07 17:00:56	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-08-07 17:02:53	Marty2000	Okay, back, I'll start P3
2016-08-07 17:03:27	@Espyo	you can also record the Scornet thing if you want
2016-08-07 17:03:28	@Espyo	fine if not
2016-08-07 17:03:30	@Espyo	also, another thing
2016-08-07 17:03:33	@Espyo	I've added it to the glitches page
2016-08-07 17:03:36	Marty2000	I'll do
2016-08-07 17:03:38	Marty2000	Yeah?
2016-08-07 17:03:39	@Espyo	I THINK it's already been discovered before, but
2016-08-07 17:03:40	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-07 17:03:42	@Espyo	it wasn't documented yet :|
2016-08-07 17:03:47	@Espyo	basically
2016-08-07 17:03:57	@Espyo	if you pan the radar to a section of the area you're not on
2016-08-07 17:04:03	@Espyo	you can see everything like normal on the TV
2016-08-07 17:04:22	@Espyo	but if you move your leader, the camera quickly goes back to them
2016-08-07 17:04:28	@Espyo	but before the camera moves
2016-08-07 17:04:35	@Espyo	it makes the geometry of that section of the area disappear
2016-08-07 17:04:39	@Espyo	and the objects remain
2016-08-07 17:04:43	@Espyo	sometimes, they have really weird lighting
2016-08-07 17:04:46	Marty2000	Oh
2016-08-07 17:04:47	@Espyo	other times, you can see stuff below the ground
2016-08-07 17:04:50	@Espyo	like the boxes of water
2016-08-07 17:05:03	Marty2000	Interesting
2016-08-07 17:05:10	Marty2000	I'll check as well in other areas
2016-08-07 17:05:30	@Espyo	I checked a couple of places, but certainly not all
2016-08-07 17:05:39	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-07 17:05:39	@Espyo	it's not very important, I doubt we'll find something useful for the wiki
2016-08-07 17:05:41	@Espyo	but it's still fun!
2016-08-07 17:05:43	@Espyo	and weird
2016-08-07 17:13:06	Marty2000	I've just tried the Scornet T-Pose, pretty cool thing
2016-08-07 17:13:20	Marty2000	Now for Britanny
2016-08-07 17:13:28	Marty2000	Brittany
2016-08-07 17:17:08	Marty2000	Lol
2016-08-07 17:18:23	@Espyo	do the other two leaders also make funny noises?
2016-08-07 17:20:35	Marty2000	I'm going to try
2016-08-07 17:20:41	Marty2000	I was trying the geometry thing
2016-08-07 17:20:45	Marty2000	I've taken a screenshot
2016-08-07 17:20:48	Marty2000	Let me upload it
2016-08-07 17:20:50	@Espyo	ah, right

2016-08-07 17:20:56	@Espyo	we've already got a screenshot on the wiki, though

2016-08-07 17:21:23	Marty2000	Not on the wiki ;)
2016-08-07 17:21:28	@Espyo	heh
2016-08-07 17:21:36	@Espyo	it's such a weird image, that
2016-08-07 17:21:42	@Espyo	a boss with a dumb pose, no ground...
2016-08-07 17:21:43	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-08-07 17:22:25	Marty2000	About the videos with the T-pose and Brittany, I can upload them somewhere if you want them
2016-08-07 17:22:39	Marty2000	It must work in plenty of areas to not say all areas
2016-08-07 17:22:53	Marty2000	Now, trying the leaders
2016-08-07 17:22:54	@Espyo	probably all areas
2016-08-07 17:23:01	@Espyo	dunno if we need videos
2016-08-07 17:23:06	@Espyo	but you can upload them to your channel anyway
2016-08-07 17:23:10	@Espyo	your channel has cool Pikmin stuff
2016-08-07 17:23:17	@Espyo	not necessarily all of the things there go on the wiki
2016-08-07 17:23:18	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-07 17:23:42	Marty2000	Alph makes some strange noises as well, heh heh
2016-08-07 17:23:54	@Espyo	aww, I should've tried
2016-08-07 17:24:24	Marty2000	Nothing very funny for the Captain,  though
2016-08-07 17:24:38	@Espyo	hm
2016-08-07 17:26:13	Marty2000	Sometimes I also think I should share somewhere some tricks to get out of bounds (even though it leads to nothing really helpful) or some places where you can actually throw the leaders
2016-08-07 17:26:24	@Espyo	I guess youtube works well for thar
2016-08-07 17:26:26	@Espyo	*t
2016-08-07 17:26:30	Marty2000	Yep
2016-08-07 17:27:00	Marty2000	Let me take a screenshot (I guess that one is known, but it's an example)

2016-08-07 17:29:58	@Espyo	hm
2016-08-07 17:30:06	@Espyo	seems obvious in hindsight, but I never thought about it

2016-08-07 18:24:20	Marty2000	Happened while I was playing with Jake and the others
2016-08-07 18:24:22	Marty2000	Weird bomb.;.
2016-08-07 18:24:26	Marty2000	...*
2016-08-07 18:27:59	@Espyo	pfft
2016-08-07 18:28:02	@Espyo	yeah, happens every once in a while
2016-08-07 18:29:09	Marty2000	Oh, so that has already happened to you once?
2016-08-07 18:29:16	Marty2000	I didn't know that glitch
2016-08-07 18:30:12	@Espyo	once? more like once every month
2016-08-07 18:30:24	@Espyo	off I go to through a sprinkler or a sticky bomb
2016-08-07 18:30:29	@Espyo	and it goes and does something like that
2016-08-07 18:30:36	@Espyo	you can get to happen a lot on the respawn platform with sprinklers
2016-08-07 18:32:07	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-07 18:32:13	Marty2000	Thanks. I didn't know that

2016-08-07 18:46:19	Nikki89	Testyo what's the square root of pie?

2016-08-07 18:46:36	Scruffy	That looks like a useful new glitch, I wonder what could lie under the ground in P3

2016-08-07 18:47:57	Testyo	HELLO ENEMY TEAM IM ABOUT TO COME OVER THE 17 LIMIT HERE IS TOO LOW, IMO
2016-08-07 18:48:15	Nikki89	Testyo has a brain the size of a puppy
2016-08-07 18:48:16	Testyo	I don't know if it shows, but I'm no JS wizard
2016-08-07 18:48:17	Nikki89	hue hue
2016-08-07 18:48:47	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo, thank you for the PFE tutorials as well!
2016-08-07 18:48:49	Nikki89	Testyo, what color is the sky?
2016-08-07 18:48:49	Testyo	Dark Yellow.
2016-08-07 18:48:55	Nikki89	LIES!
2016-08-07 18:48:58	@Espyo	oh, you're welcome
2016-08-07 18:49:00	Scruffy	I've already created a new hazard, mud
2016-08-07 18:49:06	@Espyo	I wanted to finish those asap
2016-08-07 18:49:12	@Espyo	so I could have today and next week to myself
2016-08-07 18:49:22	Scruffy	It's a new liquid that slows down all Pikmin
2016-08-07 18:49:22	Nikki89	<_< whachu two chatting about?
2016-08-07 18:49:26	@Espyo	and yeah, that glitch is interesting, but I can't help but think it's already been known...
2016-08-07 18:49:31	@Espyo	Nikki89: my engine, I released a new version yesterday
2016-08-07 18:49:40	Nikki89	oooh 
2016-08-07 18:49:49	@Espyo	oh, it's your birthday? well, happy birthday, Nikki!
2016-08-07 18:49:51	Nikki89	what kind of engine? 
2016-08-07 18:49:54	Nikki89	thank you <3
2016-08-07 18:49:59	@Espyo	an engine that runs fan-made Pikmin games
2016-08-07 18:50:06	Nikki89	o.o! niiiice
2016-08-07 18:50:10	@Espyo	:D
2016-08-07 18:50:16	@Espyo	and the idea of mud sounds great, Scruffy
2016-08-07 18:50:22	@Espyo	and I bet it didn't take that long to make
2016-08-07 18:50:26	@Espyo	so simple, but so effective
2016-08-07 18:50:27	Nikki89	-tries to mess with Testyo more-
2016-08-07 18:50:27	Testyo	inside Crystals. In one case, in the Garden of Hope, there is a overturned plant pot made of Fragments; when finished, it is used as a platform to access the level select in Sonic 3D
2016-08-07 18:50:39	@Espyo	oh, by the by
2016-08-07 18:50:41	Scruffy	!!! WAT
2016-08-07 18:50:45	Nikki89	the words confuse me more then my intentions 
2016-08-07 18:50:52	@Espyo	if there was anything in the tutorial that threw you off, let me know, please
2016-08-07 18:51:04	@Espyo	if the tutorial is just confusing people, that's no good, is it
2016-08-07 18:51:14	@Espyo	I'm the one who can fix it, and leaving it be confusing is dumb
2016-08-07 18:51:25	@Espyo	wait what
2016-08-07 18:51:29	@Espyo	I didn't even read what Testyo wrote
2016-08-07 18:51:29	Testyo	it is, Plants and fungi sounds awkward
2016-08-07 18:51:35	@Espyo	Testyo, that's... incredibly concise
2016-08-07 18:51:35	Testyo	why are wollywogs for a few years
2016-08-07 18:51:40	Nikki89	yaaaaaa
2016-08-07 18:51:41	@Espyo	even if it is COMPLETE NONSENSE
2016-08-07 18:52:03	Nikki89	Testyo can you make apple pie?
2016-08-07 18:52:03	Testyo	HAHAAHAHAH BASTARD
2016-08-07 18:52:04	Marty2000	Hi Scruffy
2016-08-07 18:52:08	Nikki89	o.o!
2016-08-07 18:52:08	Scruffy	Hi Marty
2016-08-07 18:52:18	Nikki89	why does Testyo call naaaaaaames!
2016-08-07 18:52:19	Testyo	you can find it in Kakariko Village
2016-08-07 18:52:25	@Espyo	the more I think about what Testyo said, the more I laugh
2016-08-07 18:52:25	Testyo	it was posted on the wiki?
2016-08-07 18:52:27	Nikki89	omg i love that village in oot
2016-08-07 18:52:33	@Espyo	yeah, you build up a pot, and you can ENTER A LEVEL SELECT IN A DIFFERENT GAME WITH IT
2016-08-07 18:52:34	@Espyo	SEEMS LEGIT
2016-08-07 18:52:45	Nikki89	Testyo THE POWER OF THE TRIFORCE IS WITH GANON!
2016-08-07 18:52:46	Testyo	and appear in that column's region :|
2016-08-07 18:53:08	Nikki89	hiya marty <3
2016-08-07 18:54:51	Marty2000	Hi Nicole
2016-08-07 18:54:57	Scruffy	The texture tinting feature is really useful
2016-08-07 18:54:58	Nikki89	Testyo do you like pandas?
2016-08-07 18:54:58	Testyo	so the Charger allows me to avoid conflict, but still kill if I think I'll like this story
2016-08-07 18:55:07	Nikki89	O_o
2016-08-07 18:55:16	Nikki89	i don't like Testyo, espyo
2016-08-07 18:55:16	Testyo	Maaan, you in game when l'm ready,l'll hunt whenever you're ready.
2016-08-07 18:55:19	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo, one suggestion
2016-08-07 18:55:34	Scruffy	It's kind of confusing that the duplicate button is marked "D"
2016-08-07 18:55:43	Scruffy	For me at least, I keep assuming it means "delete"
2016-08-07 18:56:15	Scruffy	maybe you could mark it "x2" or something like that?
2016-08-07 18:57:26	Nikki89	okay i'm bored
2016-08-07 18:57:26	Testyo	Oh, you're bored? Play a hangman game!
2016-08-07 18:58:00	Nikki89	laterz
2016-08-07 19:02:41	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that too
2016-08-07 19:02:45	@Espyo	hmm, x2... that might work
2016-08-07 19:02:48	@Espyo	if it fits, I'll place it
2016-08-07 19:03:03	<--	Nikki89 (Mibbit@j-04-337-367-260.hsd8.fl.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
2016-08-07 19:03:47	@Espyo	hmm, if I make the buttons bigger, they'll fit
2016-08-07 19:04:34	@Espyo	hey, that works nicely
2016-08-07 19:04:39	@Espyo	thanks for the suggestion
2016-08-07 19:04:45	Scruffy	No problem
2016-08-07 19:05:14	Scruffy	Also, if you kill an enemy that has been petrified, it won't die (and hence become carriable) until after the spray wears off
2016-08-07 19:05:22	Scruffy	But that's not as importatn
2016-08-07 19:05:48	@Espyo	yeah, that's simply not implemented
2016-08-07 19:05:57	@Espyo	I uh... kinda realized very late that I hadn't tested the petrification well enough
2016-08-07 19:06:04	@Espyo	and didn't even realize that it's missing the entire killing mechanic
2016-08-07 19:06:12	Scruffy	heh, no problem
2016-08-07 19:06:13	@Espyo	but, it's kind hard to do it since it's not real petrification, is it
2016-08-07 19:06:18	@Espyo	it's just a gray tint and a 0 speed modifier
2016-08-07 19:06:26	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-07 19:06:34	@Espyo	but I'll add something in the future
2016-08-07 19:07:09	Scruffy	You could probably implement the "delete" state you added 
2016-08-07 19:07:29	Scruffy	Something like "delete_spray" where it releases little stone particles
2016-08-07 19:49:20	Yoshi2	i walked a bit too much today https://i.imgur.com/hFDmXSi.png
2016-08-07 19:49:44	Yoshi2	to give you a sense of scale, the dark grey lines are railway tracks
2016-08-07 19:50:46	Marty2000	Hi Yoshi2
2016-08-07 19:50:47	Marty2000	Nice
2016-08-07 19:53:01	@Espyo	good grief
2016-08-07 19:53:06	@Espyo	how hot is it out for you?
2016-08-07 19:53:17	@Espyo	and Scruffy, I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that
2016-08-07 19:53:27	@Espyo	telling each enemy that "at this point, it's ok for you to have your stats changed" is one thing
2016-08-07 19:53:45	@Espyo	telling each enemy "at this state, it's ok for you to enter a petrified state" isn't, because the engine isn't meant to know what petrification is
2016-08-07 19:53:47	Yoshi2	pretty warm but the sun is worse than the heat
2016-08-07 19:53:56	@Espyo	petrification is meant to be a status effect just like any thousand of status effects you can make
2016-08-07 19:54:04	@Espyo	it's intense outside for us
2016-08-07 19:54:10	@Espyo	anybody would die having to walk THAT much
2016-08-07 19:54:49	Yoshi2	I did two breaks in the shadows
2016-08-07 19:55:35	Marty2000	I feel lucky, it's not very hot here
2016-08-07 19:56:19	Marty2000	26°C
2016-08-07 19:56:19	Testyo	26 °C = 78.8 °F / 299.15 K
2016-08-07 19:56:39	@Espyo	 34C out on the shade here
2016-08-07 19:56:39	Testyo	34 C = 93.2 °F / 307.15 K
2016-08-07 19:57:11	Scruffy	We're at 32 right now, the worst is yet to come
2016-08-07 19:57:59	@Espyo	on one hand, I'm glad for this heat
2016-08-07 19:58:03	@Espyo	screw the cold, ugh
2016-08-07 19:58:11	@Espyo	but on another, it's pretty intense too
2016-08-07 19:58:16	Marty2000	Prefer the cold :p
2016-08-07 19:58:29	@Espyo	at least going on holiday means going to pools, which, on this heat, feels incredible
2016-08-07 19:58:33	@Espyo	the cold always attacks me
2016-08-07 19:58:45	@Espyo	cold sores, common colds, asthma...
2016-08-07 19:58:52	@Espyo	and everything is just so dark and slow
2016-08-07 20:00:33	Marty2000	I see.
2016-08-07 20:01:37	Scruffy	Oh shoot, Espyo, with this new system you'll need to create carrying paths exclusive to Blue Pikmin
2016-08-07 20:02:17	Scruffy	So that Blue Pikmin can take shortcuts through water bodies
2016-08-07 20:02:56	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-08-07 20:03:06	@Espyo	I'll also have to create paths for wandering enemies
2016-08-07 20:03:12	@Espyo	so, I'll have to revamp the system
2016-08-07 20:04:06	@Espyo	I hadn't pointed that down

2016-08-07 20:29:16	Scruffy	Instantaneous isn't necessarily incorrect grammar...
2016-08-07 20:29:31	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-07 20:29:39	Scruffy	Although, instant is an easier word
2016-08-07 20:29:50	Scruffy	Helps the sentence flow better
2016-08-07 20:30:52	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-08-07 20:31:28	Yoshi2	i liked the previous word better
2016-08-07 20:31:46	Marty2000	Same
2016-08-07 20:31:53	@Espyo	ugh, might as well leave it
2016-08-07 20:31:59	@Espyo	I honestly don't have enough life in me to worry about that
2016-08-07 20:32:07	Marty2000	Hah
2016-08-07 20:32:09	@Espyo	there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus on which is more correct
2016-08-07 20:32:31	Yoshi2	me and marty are the clear consensus
2016-08-07 20:34:40	Marty2000	;)
2016-08-07 20:34:42	Scruffy	Actually, I like instantaneously better in that context, now that I think about it
2016-08-07 20:35:06	Marty2000	Check that Scruffy http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/42168/difference-between-instantly-and-instantaneously
2016-08-07 20:35:23	Marty2000	"Instantly means at once or immediately. Instantaneously means happening so soon (in relation to something else) that no delay is perceptible. " Is that what those words mean for you?
2016-08-07 20:35:57	Scruffy	Yes, but you can technically use either to mean "at once or immediately" as long as you are consistent
2016-08-07 20:36:25	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-07 20:36:28	Scruffy	Instantaneous is usually reserved for measurements, like in physics
2016-08-07 20:37:02	Yoshi2	i would change it back if only because the reasoning is flawed
2016-08-07 20:37:11	Scruffy	"Instantaneous velocity" is an object's velocity at only one infinitely small snapshot of time, for example
2016-08-07 20:37:44	@Espyo	I want to change it back simply because it's a pointless change, and he thinks he's high and mighty for doing it
2016-08-07 20:37:49	Scruffy	Yeah, it's not really a correction, just a change
2016-08-07 20:37:53	@Espyo	but in doing so, I would more or less be acting high and mighty myself
2016-08-07 20:38:03	@Espyo	sacrificing the good of the wiki over a semi-personal quarrel

2016-08-07 21:13:33	Scruffy	The enemy hazard description is a little weird
2016-08-07 21:14:32	Scruffy	Enemies are a hazard on their own, but if an enemy employs other hazards then it shouldn't be considered an enemy hazards
2016-08-07 21:14:34	Scruffy	hazard*
2016-08-07 21:15:06	Scruffy	So by that logic, shouldn't stabbing be an enemy hazard and not a blunt force hazard?

2016-08-07 21:37:10	@Espyo	but of course, the engine doesn't consider "biting" a hazard
2016-08-07 21:37:22	@Espyo	yeah, stabbing should be enemy-specific

2016-08-07 21:37:28	@Espyo	what if an obstacle uses it in Pikmin 4, for instance?
2016-08-07 21:37:33	@Espyo	ugh
2016-08-07 21:37:37	@Espyo	the concept of hazard is always a pain

2016-08-07 21:38:57	Scruffy	We'll just keep stabbing where it is

However, if you defeat the creature by throwing Pikmin, Alph won't talk and there's no "lock-on" tutorial. Later, if you come back as Charlie or Brittany (when that Bulborb has respawned), the game will focus on the 
2016-08-07 22:09:17	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-07 22:09:31	Marty2000	creature, and Brittany/Charlie start talking, but no text appears on screen

2016-08-09 16:20:32	Marty2000	Hello
2016-08-09 16:24:25	Yoshi2	hi marty
2016-08-09 16:24:32	Yoshi2	http://zeldauniverse.net/forums/Thread/181341-Shift-in-Focus-Gender-v-Pronouns/ what do you think about this
2016-08-09 16:26:04	Marty2000	Going to check
2016-08-09 16:36:17	Marty2000	I think it's a good idea: since the character is refered to using different pronouns, we should display them (in oder to gather as much information as possible for the wiki). But on the other hand, I would keep the gender as well (for example, real gender and "believed gender" or something like that)
2016-08-09 16:36:43	Marty2000	Otherwise, I don't know much about the series, but I knew about Sheik, at least. :p
2016-08-09 16:37:56	Yoshi2	it does simplify the gender thing a bit because the used pronouns are fact, the sometimes gender isn't
2016-08-09 16:38:02	Yoshi2	but on the other hand
2016-08-09 16:38:17	Yoshi2	what does the game use in the Japanese translation?
2016-08-09 16:38:24	Yoshi2	or in any of the European translations
2016-08-09 16:38:54	Yoshi2	seems like something you could make an entire table on the page for
2016-08-09 16:39:56	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-09 16:40:23	Yoshi2	anyway, context:

2016-08-09 16:40:55	Marty2000	I guess he is not for the change
2016-08-09 16:42:36	Yoshi2	pikipedia will be safe from that nonsense anyway because of how little characters there are
2016-08-09 16:43:23	Marty2000	You could very well precise the real gender, believed or played gender + (yes, +) possibly mention the pronouns used for that character...
2016-08-09 16:43:28	Marty2000	Yes, phew
2016-08-09 16:44:07	Yoshi2	solution: don't have the gender in the infobox because that just makes things complicated ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-08-09 16:44:16	Yoshi2	could have trivia info at the bottom though
2016-08-09 16:44:29	Marty2000	True
2016-08-09 16:47:00	Yoshi2	I do find the reasoning I saw further down a bit problematic
2016-08-09 16:47:35	Yoshi2	it basically went "I already had people be thankful that the info was in the infobox"
2016-08-09 16:47:49	Yoshi2	yaaaa no crap, you could find people who are thankful for anything
2016-08-09 16:49:42	Marty2000	Yes

2016-08-09 16:56:52	Yoshi2	there is SOME point to showing the pronouns

2016-08-09 16:58:03	Yoshi2	but ehhh, if the gender thing worked for the majority of the characters, couldn't the pronoun thing be used for those it doesn't work for
2016-08-09 16:58:11	Yoshi2	I really don't get the reasoning
2016-08-09 16:58:22	Yoshi2	also that is fucking lol

2016-08-09 16:58:46	Marty2000	In the article you posted, they use "she" to refer to the character, but nothing in the pronoun thing...
2016-08-09 16:58:57	Nvortex	they are literally censoring and blocking whoever takes out this pronoun bullshit

2016-08-09 17:05:47	Nvortex	he got censored already
2016-08-09 17:08:23	Yoshi2	i would hardly call that "censored"
2016-08-09 17:08:41	Yoshi2	considering the main point of his text is still there, which should be all that counts

2016-08-09 18:50:20	@Espyo	well, to us, we don't get more complex personalities than "Louie eats bugs"
2016-08-09 18:50:28	@Espyo	no need to boil our heads over whether Sheik is male or female
2016-08-09 18:50:48	@Espyo	so I can't imagine us having to take the same decisions any time in the future, much less employ them

2016-08-09 18:52:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-09 18:52:46	@Espyo	but she could identify as a male! D:
2016-08-09 18:52:50	@Espyo	I mean, I get the idea
2016-08-09 18:53:01	@Espyo	I too agree that gender identity is not as black and white as people make it out to be
2016-08-09 18:53:03	@Espyo	but one thing's for sure
2016-08-09 18:53:09	@Espyo	"male" and "female" are so widely used because they're simple
2016-08-09 18:53:38	Yoshi2	I'd leave the gender in the info box and for cases where it is unclear, have a new info box or table
2016-08-09 18:53:43	@Espyo	if we need to refer to a group of people, we aren't going to painstakingly list the exact values on the scale of gender identity, sexual preference, biological gender, etc. that each one is included in, for the sake of describing that group accurately
2016-08-09 18:53:54	@Espyo	you just say "a group of girls" and it works perfectly
2016-08-09 18:54:03	Yoshi2	for all we know, is the gender for a character the same in all the languages?
2016-08-09 18:54:13	@Espyo	should be
2016-08-09 18:54:22	@Espyo	but apparently the French version of P2 likes to make its own canon...
2016-08-09 18:54:28	Yoshi2	what about Japanese? IIrc Nintendo likes to change gender a bit
2016-08-09 18:54:32	@Espyo	true
2016-08-09 18:54:34	@Espyo	Birdo and all
2016-08-09 18:54:49	@Espyo	but afaik, there are absolutely no ambiguities regarding genders, sexual identities, etc. in the Pikmin series
2016-08-09 18:54:59	Yoshi2	indeed
2016-08-09 18:55:01	@Espyo	most we have is the Empress Bulblax being a female
2016-08-09 18:55:11	@Espyo	but hey, that's not a problem that concerns us since we have policies about that already
2016-08-09 18:55:13	@Espyo	we use "it" for enemies
2016-08-09 18:55:16	@Espyo	problem solved forever
2016-08-09 18:55:27	Yoshi2	there probably won't be any people yelling about the TRUE gender of a pikmin animal
2016-08-09 18:55:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-09 18:55:35	@Espyo	and if there are...
2016-08-09 18:55:41	@Espyo	we'll point them to [[Pikipedia:Helping out]]

2016-08-09 18:56:03	@Espyo	till then... let's not overcomplicate, folks :P
2016-08-09 18:56:45	Marty2000	Yeah :p

2016-08-09 18:59:18	@Espyo	just heard that a few hours ago too
2016-08-09 18:59:31	@Espyo	IT'S NOTHING BUT TOILET SOUNDS
2016-08-09 19:01:48	Yoshi2	but doesn't sound any worse than the original
2016-08-09 19:02:33	@Espyo	the original...32x version, right?
2016-08-09 19:02:37	Yoshi2	yes

2016-08-09 19:41:34	@J	yes
2016-08-09 19:42:00	@J	so I made 2 bread roll sandwiches, but I accidentally put them back together wrong
2016-08-09 19:42:08	@J	so I have one with 2 tops and one with 2 bottoms
2016-08-09 19:43:07	@Espyo	that actually sounds a LOT more disappointing than what it really is
2016-08-09 19:43:12	@Espyo	I feel for you

2016-08-10 02:43:22	@PikFan	hi En_Passant
2016-08-10 02:43:37	En_Passant	Does 10-day require the clip for Scornet Maestro?
2016-08-10 02:43:48	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2016-08-10 02:44:05	@PikFan	wait, clip?
2016-08-10 02:44:21	En_Passant	I can beat it before sunset, but there's not enough time to get Louie back
2016-08-10 02:44:47	@PikFan	wait, are you talking about the bridge glitch
2016-08-10 02:44:47	En_Passant	Yeah, there's a clip to avoid the red bridge leading to its arena
2016-08-10 02:45:04	@PikFan	yeah, you need the clip
2016-08-10 02:45:15	@PikFan	and then you have to build the bridge DURING the battle
2016-08-10 02:45:59	En_Passant	How do you get enough Winged Pikmin for that?
2016-08-10 02:46:25	@PikFan	I'm not sure, honestly
2016-08-10 02:46:35	En_Passant	I know speedruns don't build it at all
2016-08-10 02:46:47	@PikFan	pretty impressive that you're trying the 10 day run
2016-08-10 02:46:48	En_Passant	They use some crap to get through the invisible wall
2016-08-10 02:46:51	@PikFan	oh, they don't?
2016-08-10 02:47:00	En_Passant	I don't want to do that
2016-08-10 02:47:12	@PikFan	...I'm confused now lol
2016-08-10 02:47:45	En_Passant	There's a wall on the far side of the bridge
2016-08-10 02:48:37	En_Passant	You have to push Louie through it to get the Pikmin to path to base
2016-08-10 02:51:57	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-10 02:52:09	@PikFan	I can't do a 10 day run
2016-08-10 02:52:19	@PikFan	though I might be able to do a 7 day run

2016-08-10 04:48:12	CraftedPbody	It's something for my fanon game.
2016-08-10 04:48:23	Scruffy	And neat pattern on their backs
2016-08-10 04:48:35	Scruffy	What are they called?
2016-08-10 04:48:47	CraftedPbody	Every area has a "midboss" type of enemy that will enter randomly and roam the area.
2016-08-10 04:48:56	CraftedPbody	I don't have a name currently
2016-08-10 04:49:20	CraftedPbody	But I do know what it behaves like
2016-08-10 04:50:46	CraftedPbody	So, this bulbear species has the ability to leap up onto higher ledges, it's faster than a normal bulbear, and isn't prone to flinch from its eyes.
2016-08-10 04:51:01	Scruffy	Cool
2016-08-10 04:51:07	CraftedPbody	It can also summon the dwarves
2016-08-10 04:52:17	CraftedPbody	It won't do this very often, but it can do it
2016-08-10 04:52:29	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-10 04:52:45	Scruffy	Good stuff, I like its varied abilities

2016-08-10 04:53:59	Scruffy	By the way, you asking about Discord made me look it up and I hadn't realized how easy it is
2016-08-10 04:54:25	Scruffy	I just created an account, but how would I find you? Do I need to create a server?

2016-08-10 19:19:04	CraftedPbody	hello all
2016-08-10 19:19:19	Yoshi2	hi CraftedPbody 
2016-08-10 19:19:24	@Espyo	yeah, I remember you saying
2016-08-10 19:19:26	@Espyo	hey CraftedPbody
2016-08-10 19:20:05	@Espyo	there are still some seams
2016-08-10 19:20:09	@Espyo	is that because the bump is too high?
2016-08-10 19:20:36	Yoshi2	Espyo: because I don't want to spend time making a full blown editor, I converted the terrain into grayscale and edited it with paint.net
2016-08-10 19:20:46	@Espyo	works perfectly
2016-08-10 19:21:11	Yoshi2	the grayscale conversion is lossy due to there being 16 bit height values (of which only 6000 values are used)
2016-08-10 19:21:34	Yoshi2	I settled with dividing with a scale of 1:24
2016-08-10 19:22:00	Yoshi2	the seams used to be MUCH worse, but I recently wrote code to try and stitch the edges together
2016-08-10 19:22:23	Yoshi2	doesn't work perfectly as you can see, but it's a bit more bearable for the eyes
2016-08-10 19:23:33	CraftedPbody	What's this you two are talking about?

2016-08-10 19:24:54	CraftedPbody	oh, I see what you mean when you say there's alot of seams
2016-08-10 19:26:03	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-08-10 19:28:02	Yoshi2	and I think I have an idea why there are still seams
2016-08-10 19:29:00	Yoshi2	I iterate over a list of neighbours and always divide by 2 to get the average
2016-08-10 19:29:10	Yoshi2	but maybe with a different order it rounds differently
2016-08-10 19:29:48	Yoshi2	so instead I should add them together, and then divide by 4 to get the average of 4 corners
2016-08-10 19:29:49	@Espyo	ah, yeah

2016-08-10 19:50:03	Yoshi2	i just did the math and realized
2016-08-10 19:50:55	Yoshi2	repeatedly adding and dividing by 2 does not result in the same value as if you add all together and then divide by 4 
2016-08-10 19:51:12	Yoshi2	somehow
2016-08-10 19:51:46	Yoshi2	(((a+b)/2 + c)/2) + d)/2
2016-08-10 19:52:17	Yoshi2	results in d/2 + c/4 + a/8 + b/8
2016-08-10 19:53:18	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-08-10 19:53:25	@Espyo	makes sense in retrospect
2016-08-10 19:54:27	Yoshi2	somehow I never thought about how the two aren't equal
2016-08-10 19:54:36	Yoshi2	but yeah, makes sense
2016-08-10 19:54:51	Yoshi2	as you can see, the last value you add and divide has the biggest impact on the result
2016-08-10 19:55:44	@Espyo	yep

2016-08-10 21:42:51	Yoshi2	this should receive much more hype than it did
2016-08-10 21:43:37	@Espyo	you undersold it
2016-08-10 21:43:42	Yoshi2	I guess I need to drum up a bit of hype by making a video about this
2016-08-10 21:43:48	@Espyo	you definitely do
2016-08-10 21:43:57	@Espyo	it's ok though, I got pretty pumped when you showed the images just now
2016-08-10 21:45:20	Yoshi2	BW2 was supposed to have a vehicle racing level
2016-08-10 21:45:32	@Espyo	pfft
2016-08-10 21:45:35	Yoshi2	maybe with this we could actually do that
2016-08-10 21:45:49	@Espyo	almost certainly
2016-08-10 21:46:03	@Espyo	just make a model on Blender, render its heightmap to an image, and presto
2016-08-10 21:46:30	@Espyo	or import an existing one, from like Mario Kart 8
2016-08-10 21:46:32	@Espyo	the possibilities, man...
2016-08-10 21:47:34	@Espyo	wtf
2016-08-10 21:47:37	@Espyo	C++ just let me write
2016-08-10 21:47:43	@Espyo	return (x + 1, y + 1);
2016-08-10 21:47:45	@Espyo	that's not legal
2016-08-10 21:47:48	@Espyo	in the slightest
2016-08-10 21:48:04	@Espyo	that was meant to be return Point(x + 1, y + 1);
2016-08-10 21:48:11	@Espyo	I assumed that it has an implied "Point", since I'm working on that class
2016-08-10 21:48:12	@Espyo	but nope
2016-08-10 21:48:18	@Espyo	actually adding the missing Point does make a difference
2016-08-10 21:48:23	@Espyo	it just did GARBAGE before
2016-08-10 21:48:31	@Espyo	I'm surprised at how it even ran
2016-08-10 21:48:52	Yoshi2	Null(x+1, y+1)
2016-08-10 21:49:10	@Espyo	that's still hot garbage for C++
2016-08-10 21:49:38	@Espyo	it might have...
2016-08-10 21:49:40	@Espyo	oh jeez
2016-08-10 21:49:51	@Espyo	I think it implied that the (x + 1, y +1) is a number, worth x + 1
2016-08-10 21:49:59	@Espyo	and just used that as a parameter for the constructor Point(x, y)
2016-08-10 21:50:05	@Espyo	because the Xs were fine, the Ys weren't
2016-08-10 21:50:06	@Espyo	that's just...
2016-08-10 21:50:09	@Espyo	several layers of shenanigans

2016-08-11 02:08:47	Scruffy	Are you ever on the audio part of Discord?

2016-08-11 02:08:53	@PikFan	...yes
2016-08-11 02:09:04	@PikFan	I get to terrify people with my awful voice :P

2016-08-11 02:09:22	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-11 02:09:29	Scruffy	I think I'll be able to on Friday
2016-08-11 02:09:31	@PikFan	they say my voice is fine

2016-08-11 02:10:34	@PikFan	perhaps it's because of the way you presented that video
2016-08-11 02:10:53	Scruffy	I guess
2016-08-11 02:11:13	Scruffy	I'm making a new one on some oddities in the Pikmin 2 sound files
2016-08-11 02:11:33	@PikFan	ooooh
2016-08-11 02:22:19	Scruffy	So I acquired No Man's Sky yesterday
2016-08-11 02:22:27	@PikFan	mhm?
2016-08-11 02:22:31	Scruffy	So far it's really fun, and actually has a lot of similarities to Pikmin
2016-08-11 02:22:31	@PikFan	how do you feel?
2016-08-11 02:22:36	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-08-11 02:22:48	Scruffy	In that you begin on an alien planet with a crashed ship
2016-08-11 02:22:54	@PikFan	right
2016-08-11 02:22:57	Scruffy	And you document flora and fauna as you find it
2016-08-11 02:23:07	@PikFan	nice
2016-08-11 02:23:16	Scruffy	Except, you repair your ship parts using raw elements rather than finding the intact parts
2016-08-11 02:23:19	@PikFan	wait, what platform are you playing it on?
2016-08-11 02:23:24	Scruffy	PS4
2016-08-11 02:23:29	@PikFan	oh, I see
2016-08-11 02:24:07	Scruffy	Also, the flora and fauna are procedurally generated per planet, and their names are procedurally created when you discover them
2016-08-11 02:24:20	Scruffy	But you can rename them (or not) and upload the discovery
2016-08-11 02:24:41	Scruffy	Then if (A BIG IF) anyone else finds it, it'll have that name and show you discovered it first
2016-08-11 02:24:50	@PikFan	hehe, right
2016-08-11 02:25:11	@PikFan	because the odds of other players finding what you already discovered are /astronomically/ low ;)
2016-08-11 02:25:29	Scruffy	Heh... heh......
2016-08-11 02:25:41	@PikFan	I'm sorry, I couldn't resist

2016-08-11 19:19:55	@Espyo	from the title, I think it's just hitting the top vs hitting the side whilst standing up

2016-08-11 19:24:55	Marty2000	Finally, even though I don't know how to reproduce this... there's a glitch that allows a Pikmin to attack on the top of a gate with its "hitting the side whilst standing up" animation
2016-08-11 19:26:19	@Espyo	geez...
2016-08-11 19:26:21	@Espyo	that's dumb
2016-08-11 19:30:36	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-08-11 19:33:52	Marty2000	For Pikmin 3, we have to check as well (the way it works is the opposite of P2)
2016-08-11 19:34:47	Marty2000	I can check now
2016-08-11 19:35:21	@Espyo	hm? so it's faster if they hit from above?
2016-08-11 19:37:20	Marty2000	I don't know, I should check, but basically, the animations are "reversed" in P3 (hitting the top in P2 = hitting the side in P3 ; hitting the side in P2 = Pikmin latching onto the gate in P3)
2016-08-11 19:37:49	Marty2000	I'm saying that because I'm sure that's how it works, but I'm going to verify anyway
2016-08-11 19:39:15	@Espyo	hmm
2016-08-11 19:39:16	@Espyo	please do
2016-08-11 19:39:32	Marty2000	Yep
2016-08-11 19:39:36	Marty2000	I'm starting
2016-08-11 19:40:13	Marty2000	I'll take a single Pikmin and stop my timer once 1/3 of the gate has been destroyed.

2016-08-11 19:46:56	@Espyo	hmm
2016-08-11 19:47:03	@Espyo	oh, but I think it was already known that latching is faster...

2016-08-11 19:47:36	Marty2000	Oh, yeah
2016-08-11 19:47:39	@Espyo	thing with Pikmin 2 is that they attack while standing on top of the thing
2016-08-11 19:47:45	@Espyo	is that possible in P3?
2016-08-11 19:47:56	Marty2000	Nope
2016-08-11 19:48:02	@Espyo	right
2016-08-11 19:48:14	@Espyo	and is it possible for them to latch on to the walls of a gate in P1/2?
2016-08-11 19:48:27	Marty2000	No
2016-08-11 19:48:45	@Espyo	so I guess it's two different tests entirely
2016-08-11 19:48:52	@Espyo	the P3 test is already known, Pikmin are faster while latched
2016-08-11 19:48:54	Marty2000	Their "latching on animation" happens when they hit the gate from the ground.
2016-08-11 19:48:56	@Espyo	...probably depends on the Pikmin type
2016-08-11 19:49:03	Marty2000	Yes, depends on the Pikmin type
2016-08-11 19:49:05	Marty2000	(power)
2016-08-11 19:51:07	@Espyo	such complex science...
2016-08-11 19:51:40	Marty2000	Hmmm... if we want to add fun...
2016-08-11 19:51:51	Marty2000	we can try to see what happens with Ultra-Spicy Spray
2016-08-11 19:52:56	Marty2000	Since it speeds up the Pikmin's animations as well.
2016-08-11 19:54:17	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-11 19:54:39	@Espyo	also, that video only showed that their slapping animations are faster
2016-08-11 19:54:47	@Espyo	but is the damage they caused linked to the animation?
2016-08-11 19:54:57	@Espyo	if it is, then yeah, I guess you can take down a gate faster by having a Pikmin attacking its side
2016-08-11 19:55:03	@Espyo	but if not, that's also important to note
2016-08-11 19:55:17	Marty2000	"I guess you can take down a gate faster by having a Pikmin attacking its side" I think that's it
2016-08-11 19:56:20	Marty2000	I'll try with P2
2016-08-11 19:57:21	Marty2000	I'll try HSS's method
2016-08-11 19:57:37	Marty2000	I'll keep track of how many times a Pikmin hit a gate within 50 seconds
2016-08-11 19:58:40	@Espyo	I don't think you need that
2016-08-11 19:58:50	@Espyo	since HSS already confirmed there are more hits per time on the side
2016-08-11 19:59:00	@Espyo	what matters here is if the gate is damaged equally as fast
2016-08-11 19:59:01	Marty2000	Yeah, but I'm trying with the Spicy spray
2016-08-11 19:59:07	Marty2000	Also that, yeah
2016-08-11 19:59:10	@Espyo	if its health actually drops as fast, or faster
2016-08-11 19:59:14	@Espyo	oh, yeah, spray too
2016-08-11 20:00:20	Marty2000	... but I have to make some progress, I'm stuck at the Awakening Wood (and it's not possible to throw a red Pikmin on the top of a gate here....)
2016-08-11 20:01:24	Marty2000	Unless...
2016-08-11 20:01:43	Marty2000	I take down one third of a gate so I can try directly here
2016-08-11 20:01:56	Marty2000	Yeah, that's better
2016-08-11 20:02:08	Marty2000	I'm ready to try

2016-08-11 20:03:55	Marty2000	As always, I stop the time once 1/3 of the gate has bene destroyed.

2016-08-11 20:15:46	Marty2000	The sunset is close... and the Pikmin hasn't finished yet... I could use more Pikmin, but the results wouldn't be perfect. Is that a problem? Because we only need to know if it's equally faster, so...
2016-08-11 20:16:03	Marty2000	Too late
2016-08-11 20:16:08	Marty2000	I must retry with more Pikmin
2016-08-11 20:16:25	@Espyo	wow
2016-08-11 20:16:31	@Espyo	yeah, try with like 10
2016-08-11 20:16:35	Marty2000	Yep
2016-08-11 20:21:43	Marty2000	10 Pikmin hitting the top = 3 min 46-48 sec
2016-08-11 20:26:25	Marty2000	10 Pikmin hitting the side = 3 min 2 sec
2016-08-11 20:26:29	Marty2000	So, it's faster!
2016-08-11 20:26:45	@Espyo	cool
2016-08-11 20:27:04	Marty2000	Now with the Ultra-Spicy Spray...
2016-08-11 20:28:14	Marty2000	It's going to be hard to keep the Pikmin on the top and spray them, though... but I'll try
2016-08-11 20:28:27	Marty2000	I'll take fewer Pikmin
2016-08-11 20:28:30	Marty2000	so it'll be easier

2016-08-11 22:16:56	@PikFan	hey Scruffy
2016-08-11 22:18:23	@PikFan	"cause its morally wrong"
2016-08-11 22:18:30	@PikFan	he's making this sound like it's life or death now
2016-08-11 22:18:51	@PikFan	even I know for a fact that it's not that black and white
2016-08-11 22:20:16	@PikFan	did you see what I said, though?
2016-08-11 22:20:21	@PikFan	I would write something like, "Link was seen riding a horse in the E3 trailer. During the Game Awards demo in 2014, however, Miyamoto pointed out that the horse there was Epona, and it is unknown if these two horses are the same."
2016-08-11 22:20:43	@PikFan	I feel like that is stating the facts, and we leave some ambiguity at the end
2016-08-11 22:24:02	@PikFan	Scruffy: you're probably a bit lost right now, so I'll explain
2016-08-11 22:24:32	@PikFan	on the Zelda Wiki, they've decided that the horse that Link is riding in the trailer for Breath of the Wild is Epona
2016-08-11 22:24:54	@PikFan	and Luther — ShadowRaptor101 spoke out against this

2016-08-11 22:31:25	Scruffy	But yeah, I feel that after Miyamoto's comment on Pikmin 4's completion, his comments should be taken with a grain of salt

2016-08-11 22:32:31	Scruffy	But I feel like if asked what horse Link was riding in a new trailer, his first thought would be, "Duh, what other horse does Link ride?"

2016-08-11 22:36:53	@PikFan	well, that's the thing

2016-08-12 02:24:33	Scruffy	I've just been rendering abstract scenes
2016-08-12 02:24:38	Scruffy	Blender is really great for that
2016-08-12 02:29:11	En_Passant	Abstract scenes?
2016-08-12 02:30:01	Scruffy	Just experimenting with putting simple shapes in different color environments
2016-08-12 02:30:48	Scruffy	If I had to describe the result, it sort of looks like something you'd see in a microscope
2016-08-12 02:31:00	Scruffy	But with a satisfying color to it

2016-08-13 01:27:14	@PikFan	right
2016-08-13 01:27:29	@PikFan	also, two days ago I asked him to come onto the chatroom
2016-08-13 01:27:39	@PikFan	he says his phone can't come onto the chatroom
2016-08-13 01:27:44	@PikFan	but that doesn't make sense
2016-08-13 01:27:55	@PikFan	because I've been on the chatroom before...
2016-08-13 01:27:58	@PikFan	with my 3DS
2016-08-13 01:28:11	@PikFan	so if a 3DS can do it, then a phone should be able to
2016-08-13 01:28:22	@PikFan	unless if it's like a flip phone or something
2016-08-13 01:28:24	Scruffy	Not all phones can load it
2016-08-13 01:28:41	Marty2000	I could access the chatroom with my phone
2016-08-13 01:28:56	@PikFan	maybe he's got an older phone or something
2016-08-13 01:29:06	Marty2000	Maybe.
2016-08-13 01:29:59	@PikFan	BUT
2016-08-13 01:30:08	@PikFan	I think I found his channel
2016-08-13 01:30:15	Marty2000	Youtube?
2016-08-13 01:30:19	Marty2000	I know he has one.
2016-08-13 01:30:27	@PikFan	and in one of his videos he said he wouldn't be able to use the computer during summer
2016-08-13 01:30:35	@PikFan	so he must be using his phone to edit
2016-08-13 01:31:00	Marty2000	I see.
2016-08-13 01:31:21	@PikFan	I wonder why his phone can't load the chatroom...
2016-08-13 01:31:37	@PikFan	even if he's being honest, it doesn't make sense
2016-08-13 01:31:50	@PikFan	I'd expect phones to be able to load the chatroom since my 3DS can
2016-08-13 01:32:00	@PikFan	heck, even my OLDER 3DS was able to
2016-08-13 01:32:06	@PikFan	(but it wasn't as stable)
2016-08-13 01:33:21	Scruffy	My phone can load chat as well
2016-08-13 01:33:55	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-13 01:34:00	@PikFan	well, I suppose I can ask...

2016-08-13 01:43:28	@PikFan	nice
2016-08-13 01:48:34	Scruffy	But I mean, it'd kind of be a crime if it didn't
2016-08-13 01:48:43	Scruffy	It's Rio, you can't really avoid samba
2016-08-13 01:48:57	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-13 01:49:28	@PikFan	how's this sound regarding Logan's sig?
2016-08-13 01:49:40	@PikFan	"Also, I noticed that you made a new sig a few days ago. This sig...it's rather long. Our signature policy states that sigs "must only take up one line of space." On some computer monitors, your sig may be more than one line long, especially on mobile browsing. Please shorten your sig. ...And personally, I'd get rid of your "Happy August!" comment at the end
2016-08-13 01:49:43	@PikFan	of it, since it'll only be meaningful for the duration of this month, of which there are less than 20 days left."
2016-08-13 01:50:44	Scruffy	yeah, that sounds good
2016-08-13 01:51:24	@PikFan	it's kinda like a "happy summer!" or whatever, but that's more relaxed, since summer is 3 months, instead of just one :P
2016-08-13 01:51:37	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-08-13 01:51:52	@PikFan	I actually had an old sig that I'd change every season
2016-08-13 01:52:09	Scruffy	For me, August isn't necessarily as "happy" as june or july because it's significantly hotter and summer vacation is running out
2016-08-13 01:52:27	@PikFan	I agree
2016-08-13 01:52:39	@PikFan	August is full of trepidation
2016-08-13 01:52:46	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-13 01:53:01	@PikFan	oh, here was my old sig: http://www.pikminfanon.com/User:PikFan23/Bulborbsig
2016-08-13 01:54:20	Scruffy	Hehe, how come everyone is always approving something?
2016-08-13 01:54:26	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2016-08-13 01:54:33	@PikFan	it was a fad, honestly
2016-08-13 01:54:39	@PikFan	...and STILL is, I guess
2016-08-13 01:54:42	Scruffy	I approve
2016-08-13 01:54:47	@PikFan	hah!
2016-08-13 01:54:53	Scruffy	:P
2016-08-13 01:55:49	Scruffy	I dunno, this soundtrack isn't quite doing it for me
2016-08-13 01:55:54	Scruffy	There's too much going on
2016-08-13 01:56:01	@PikFan	oh?
2016-08-13 01:56:09	Scruffy	Some tracks that are more traditionally Brazilian do grasp good subtlety
2016-08-13 01:56:23	Scruffy	But most of the event tracks are too hectic, for me
2016-08-13 01:56:33	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-13 01:57:20	Scruffy	I'm just so relieved that Sega and Nintendo look to actual performers to score their latest stuff
2016-08-13 01:57:31	Scruffy	It makes the soundtrack sound so much more natrual
2016-08-13 01:57:35	Scruffy	natural*
2016-08-13 01:57:47	Scruffy	Not that they aren't good at electronically crafting music
2016-08-13 01:58:36	Scruffy	But it's hearing their clean, natural ensemble that makes a difference for me in their newer music
2016-08-13 01:59:36	@PikFan	I agree
2016-08-13 01:59:52	@PikFan	natural music is always better
2016-08-13 02:00:52	Scruffy	And I'm kind of a hypocrite about that because I publish music that doesn't use real instruments :P
2016-08-13 02:00:59	@PikFan	haha
2016-08-13 02:01:08	Scruffy	But I just don't have the budget, if I could I would conduct and perform in an ensemble
2016-08-13 02:01:12	@PikFan	well, as long as you recognize that hypocrisy
2016-08-13 02:01:34	@PikFan	..........eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=The_Ship&curid=1444&diff=54427&oldid=50863
2016-08-13 02:01:42	@PikFan	I...guess it's fine
2016-08-13 02:01:45	Scruffy	At least I have a piano
2016-08-13 02:01:45	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-13 02:02:00	Scruffy	I don't find anything wrong with synthesized instruments as long as you use them creatively
2016-08-13 02:02:09	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-13 02:02:22	Scruffy	If /all/ you're going to do is try to emulate real instruments, there's not much point
2016-08-13 02:02:40	Scruffy	Oh, yeah, that category
2016-08-13 02:03:10	Scruffy	Well, PF's also automatically added, so I guess it's not the only one
2016-08-13 02:03:16	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-13 02:03:30	@PikFan	but the ship appears in lots of games, so it'd kinda moot
2016-08-13 02:03:34	@PikFan	oh well
2016-08-13 02:03:39	@PikFan	*it'a
2016-08-13 02:03:42	@PikFan	**it's
2016-08-13 02:03:43	@PikFan	ugh
2016-08-13 02:03:57	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-13 02:06:57	Scruffy	huh, Sega Sound Team actually had a Portuguese band record /in/ /Rio/a vocal song for the game
2016-08-13 02:07:09	@PikFan	wow
2016-08-13 02:07:37	Scruffy	I'll give you one guess what genre it is
2016-08-13 02:08:25	@PikFan	is it...
2016-08-13 02:08:29	@PikFan	SAMBA? :P
2016-08-13 02:08:39	Scruffy	Heh how'd you know?
2016-08-13 02:08:45	@PikFan	oh I don't know :P
2016-08-13 02:08:55	Scruffy	It's called Canção do Río
2016-08-13 02:09:00	@PikFan	you were talking about it maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-08-13 02:09:10	@PikFan	ah, nice
2016-08-13 02:09:26	@PikFan	hmm, I don't know what that says
2016-08-13 02:09:42	Scruffy	Heh, the singer begins with "Alô! Vai Soniqui!"
2016-08-13 02:09:44	@PikFan	I'm guessing it means "Party of Rio"...?
2016-08-13 02:10:02	@PikFan	or "Games of Rio"?
2016-08-13 02:10:03	@PikFan	lol
2016-08-13 02:10:07	Scruffy	Song of Rio
2016-08-13 02:10:10	@PikFan	OH
2016-08-13 02:10:12	@PikFan	lol
2016-08-13 02:10:16	Scruffy	Nice and to the point
2016-08-13 02:10:26	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-13 02:10:45	Scruffy	Well, just finished that
2016-08-13 02:11:04	Scruffy	I often search youtube for video game soundtracks to download
2016-08-13 02:11:11	@PikFan	nice
2016-08-13 02:11:14	@PikFan	WOW http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Water_Dumple&curid=667&diff=54436&oldid=50436
2016-08-13 02:11:27	Scruffy	I have to confess it's most of my iPod; vgms and film soundtracks
2016-08-13 02:11:27	@PikFan	of all enemies
2016-08-13 02:11:39	@PikFan	the Water Dumple did not have an elemental category?
2016-08-13 02:11:42	 *	@PikFan faints
2016-08-13 02:11:50	@PikFan	oh, hehe, no worries
2016-08-13 02:12:18	@PikFan	honestly, if I had an iPod or MP3 player, it'd also be full of game or TV show OSTs
2016-08-13 02:12:22	@PikFan	:P
2016-08-13 02:12:38	Scruffy	Heh, they're just so good
2016-08-13 02:12:46	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-13 02:13:04	Scruffy	I like listening to soundtracks because they aren't as repetitive as your average radio song
2016-08-13 02:13:17	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-13 02:13:28	Scruffy	I like listening to video game soundtracks because I wanna compose them someday :P
2016-08-13 02:13:36	@PikFan	right
2016-08-13 02:13:40	@PikFan	you gotta dissect them
2016-08-13 02:13:45	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-13 02:13:52	@PikFan	...heck, ever since I started talking to you
2016-08-13 02:14:05	@PikFan	I've been wondering what instruments I hear in the music I listen to
2016-08-13 02:14:09	@PikFan	you're rubbing off on me
2016-08-13 02:14:12	Scruffy	Heh, nice!
2016-08-13 02:14:22	@PikFan	:P
2016-08-13 02:14:24	Scruffy	It's a good brain exercise, actually
2016-08-13 02:14:39	@PikFan	it's a puzzle for the ears
2016-08-13 02:14:49	@PikFan	cause most puzzles are optical
2016-08-13 02:14:53	Scruffy	All instruments have unique timbres that resonate with us, but when they're playing all at once...
2016-08-13 02:15:07	Scruffy	It's like discerning a sentence in a crowd of people conversing
2016-08-13 02:15:19	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-13 02:15:27	Scruffy	And then a clarinet solo calls your name and you focus right on it
2016-08-13 02:16:18	Scruffy	Actually, it's interesting, I've learned in my composition class that your brain only processes three audial streams of information at once, after categorizing sounds like "drums" or "melody" into streams
2016-08-13 02:16:30	Scruffy	So you never pay attention to a full quartet or higher
2016-08-13 02:16:37	Scruffy	pay full attention*
2016-08-13 02:16:46	@PikFan	wow
2016-08-13 02:17:00	Scruffy	But you constantly swap your attention as other parts of the ensemble direct it
2016-08-13 02:17:04	Scruffy	Which is the beauty of music
2016-08-13 02:17:25	Scruffy	Once you listen again, you realize something you hadn't before because you had focused on a different instrument
2016-08-13 02:17:35	Scruffy	or, not instrument, but a different sound
2016-08-13 02:17:45	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-13 02:18:05	@PikFan	when I listen to the same track over and over again, it often starts sounding slightly different to me
2016-08-13 02:18:21	@PikFan	like some parts I hadn't noticed before become more noticeable
2016-08-13 02:20:09	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-13 02:20:28	Scruffy	So it's a great exercise to figure out what's making what noise
2016-08-13 02:20:47	@PikFan	say, have you ever watched any Studio Ghibli films?
2016-08-13 02:21:01	@PikFan	because Joe Hisaishi is an AMAZING composer
2016-08-13 02:21:03	Scruffy	Let's see, My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away
2016-08-13 02:21:07	Scruffy	Oh yes, agreed
2016-08-13 02:22:07	@PikFan	my childhood favorite was Castle in the Sky
2016-08-13 02:22:15	@PikFan	and honestly I love the music in it
2016-08-13 02:22:28	@PikFan	it's so action packed, it feels like you're in it
2016-08-13 02:22:37	@PikFan	especially the beginning https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTuXYwU-unQ
2016-08-13 02:22:51	@PikFan	the string instruments at 1:05 in particular give me the chills
2016-08-13 02:23:13	Scruffy	Oh yes! Saw Castle in the Sky as well, that was a great one
2016-08-13 02:23:47	@PikFan	oh, 1:03, sorry
2016-08-13 02:24:15	Scruffy	Oh I love it
2016-08-13 02:24:46	Scruffy	I've only gotten to compose for orchestra once, it was such a magical experience
2016-08-13 02:24:53	Scruffy	I need to get to that point again
2016-08-13 02:27:42	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-08-13 02:27:46	@PikFan	I'd meant to tell you
2016-08-13 02:27:58	@PikFan	I discovered electric swing music some weeks ago
2016-08-13 02:28:02	@PikFan	and... ♥
2016-08-13 02:28:15	@PikFan	wait, did I already tell you this?
2016-08-13 02:28:20	Scruffy	Oh yeah, heh
2016-08-13 02:28:22	Scruffy	Oh, not yet
2016-08-13 02:28:25	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-08-13 02:28:43	Scruffy	Electric swing is great, my roommate a year ago would play it all the time
2016-08-13 02:28:47	@PikFan	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7FIjGDM7OQ
2016-08-13 02:28:52	@PikFan	it's soooooo good
2016-08-13 02:28:54	@PikFan	I wanna dance
2016-08-13 02:29:36	Scruffy	Yeah, it's infectious
2016-08-13 02:29:51	@PikFan	infectious...good word
2016-08-13 02:31:21	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-13 02:31:38	Scruffy	Whenever there's a nice beat you can use all sorts of disease words
2016-08-13 02:31:48	@PikFan	heheheheheh
2016-08-13 02:31:48	Scruffy	sick, nasty, infectious, contagious
2016-08-13 02:32:03	@PikFan	I'm not sure about nasty though :P
2016-08-13 02:32:08	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-13 02:33:00	Scruffy	Oh, by the way, sorry I couldn't go on Discord's audio chat today like I said I could
2016-08-13 02:33:17	@PikFan	oh, heh, it's alright
2016-08-13 02:33:19	Scruffy	but no one was on audio when I was available to talk :(
2016-08-13 02:33:24	@PikFan	but you're better off telling that to them :P
2016-08-13 02:33:28	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-13 02:33:31	@PikFan	oh, that sucks
2016-08-13 02:33:47	Scruffy	It'll be alright, you won't be able to get me to shut up once college starts
2016-08-13 02:33:47	@PikFan	yeah, nobody's in the audio chat right now...
2016-08-13 02:34:01	@PikFan	I don't think they want you to shut up lol
2016-08-13 02:34:09	@PikFan	they're very excited to have you
2016-08-13 02:34:18	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-13 02:34:51	@PikFan	jpmrock's reaction was...wow
2016-08-13 02:35:08	@PikFan	so was ShadowRaptor101's
2016-08-13 02:35:29	Scruffy	yeah, I didn't know I had that sort of celebrity
2016-08-13 02:35:43	Scruffy	I'd rather not be lionized or anything, but it's nice to be this integrated in a community
2016-08-13 02:36:13	Scruffy	Trying No Man's Sky's soundtrack...
2016-08-13 02:36:36	Scruffy	I was actually, afraid to say, a liiiiiittle bit disappointed by its soundtrack thus far
2016-08-13 02:37:01	Scruffy	It's all electronic, and extremely atmospheric unless some action is picking up
2016-08-13 02:37:03	@PikFan	hmm
2016-08-13 02:37:45	Scruffy	I was expecting a big brash orchestra like Star Fox
2016-08-13 02:38:36	Scruffy	I guess that was just my expectation though, it's a good standalone ambience
2016-08-13 02:38:38	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-13 02:40:21	Scruffy	It's just, if I were flying a spaceship, I'd choose that as my soundtrack, something big, orchestral, Holst-esque
2016-08-13 02:41:03	@PikFan	right
2016-08-13 02:41:51	Scruffy	I guess that's all, it didn't go quite big enough for me
2016-08-13 02:42:00	Scruffy	maybe they should have talked to Sega Sound Team :P
2016-08-13 02:42:25	@PikFan	perhaps
2016-08-13 02:43:26	Scruffy	That said, it is really nice for the other side of gameplay, walking around on planets when everything's relatively clam
2016-08-13 02:43:35	Scruffy	calm* 
2016-08-13 02:43:37	Scruffy	not clam
2016-08-13 02:44:07	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-13 02:44:23	@PikFan	Pikmin 2's music was atmospheric, wasn't it?
2016-08-13 02:44:54	Scruffy	Yes, but I feel it was much more interesting
2016-08-13 02:45:52	Scruffy	It had a diverse ensemble, it changed depending on events of the day, and when it did get extremely minimalistic, it had an element of randomness to it to score the random caves
2016-08-13 02:46:12	@PikFan	true
2016-08-13 02:46:14	Scruffy	No Man's Sky is almost entirely procedural, and yet the music is not
2016-08-13 02:46:31	Scruffy	Not that it has to be
2016-08-13 02:46:45	@PikFan	how would procedural music work? I imagine it would somehow be different from randomized music
2016-08-13 02:47:16	Scruffy	They're sort of the same, you still have to set the parameters by which sound is generated
2016-08-13 02:47:35	Scruffy	Telling a computer, "make a random sound" is very dangerous
2016-08-13 02:48:14	Scruffy	Usually it's just the rhythms, pitches/pitch sets, and structure that's randomized
2016-08-13 02:48:20	Scruffy	I guess there's the difference
2016-08-13 02:49:03	Scruffy	With random music, you say, "Each number represents a rhythmic/harmonic/textural value. Make a random string of numbers and play it"
2016-08-13 02:49:03	@PikFan	hmm
2016-08-13 02:49:36	Scruffy	With procedural, you say, "Here is a group of waveforms that you can play in any manner"
2016-08-13 02:50:10	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-13 02:50:47	Scruffy	To tell a video game to generate procedural music would probably take a lot of processing power
2016-08-13 02:51:00	@PikFan	so procedural music is more restricted in its randomness than, well, random music
2016-08-13 02:51:33	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-13 02:51:51	Scruffy	But Pikmin 2 is actually random music that is /further/ limited in its randomness
2016-08-13 02:52:11	Scruffy	But that's a good thing, you don't want the soundtrack flying out to an outlier moment when you're trying to keep your cool
2016-08-13 02:52:28	@PikFan	true
2016-08-13 02:53:21	@PikFan	hang on, brb
2016-08-13 02:53:28	Scruffy	no problem
2016-08-13 03:04:42	@PikFan	back
2016-08-13 03:04:46	@PikFan	had to walk my dog
2016-08-13 03:05:35	Scruffy	Heh, no problem
2016-08-13 03:05:38	Scruffy	Wow, that was fast
2016-08-13 03:07:05	@PikFan	that's fast?
2016-08-13 03:07:26	Scruffy	Maybe dog walking just feels slower for me
2016-08-13 03:07:39	@PikFan	that was 10 minutes :P
2016-08-13 03:07:43	@PikFan	depends on the dog, really
2016-08-13 03:07:47	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-13 03:13:00	Scruffy	Have you played Mario Kart 8?
2016-08-13 03:13:30	@PikFan	oh yes
2016-08-13 03:13:32	@PikFan	it's amazing
2016-08-13 03:13:42	@PikFan	everything is so rich
2016-08-13 03:14:00	@PikFan	and all of it whizzes by as you race on 200cc
2016-08-13 03:15:40	Scruffy	Yeah, it is amazing
2016-08-13 03:16:14	Scruffy	Well today I got the urge to record another Blender animation of some Mario characters playing the music
2016-08-13 03:16:34	Scruffy	Nintendo fortunately released videos of their musicians in the recording studio on Youtube
2016-08-13 03:16:48	Scruffy	So if I only had models of actual instruments, I could make it happen
2016-08-13 03:18:24	@PikFan	hm
2016-08-13 03:18:36	Scruffy	It's awesome to watch those videos, they're studio musicians in their elemtns
2016-08-13 03:18:40	Scruffy	element*
2016-08-13 03:20:33	@PikFan	ooooh, nice
2016-08-13 03:20:36	Scruffy	And they have a huge beautiful studio
2016-08-13 03:22:39	Scruffy	check this out, Super Bell Subway in the DLC
2016-08-13 03:22:40	Scruffy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY_Ujecl2Rc
2016-08-13 03:23:08	@PikFan	yeah, I know, I own the DLC :P
2016-08-13 03:23:12	Scruffy	at around 1:00 the bass player switches basses for the underground part
2016-08-13 03:24:38	Scruffy	And at the end they just... stop, it's so funny
2016-08-13 03:24:40	@PikFan	wow, that underground theme
2016-08-13 03:25:49	@PikFan	lol yeah
2016-08-13 03:26:46	Scruffy	I'm not sure what's my favorite tune from that game
2016-08-13 03:26:49	Scruffy	Maybe the main theme
2016-08-13 03:26:56	Scruffy	oh, Dolphin Shoals is definitely up there
2016-08-13 03:27:15	Scruffy	I have that soprano sax part absolutely memorized
2016-08-13 03:27:39	Scruffy	Couldn't play it, but I could sing it
2016-08-13 03:29:44	@PikFan	I'm not sure which is my favorite theme...
2016-08-13 04:42:50	Scruffy	gotta go for tonight

2016-08-13 13:02:46	Testyo	I think they patched out like 2 patches ago
2016-08-13 13:02:53	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-13 13:08:11	Yoshi2	Espyo: i heard you like love rap https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iawVbIxaefE
2016-08-13 13:08:23	@Espyo	oh no
2016-08-13 13:08:32	@Espyo	wait, this is GiIva
2016-08-13 13:08:36	@Espyo	I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
2016-08-13 13:08:45	@Espyo	huh
2016-08-13 13:08:47	@Espyo	this actually works
2016-08-13 13:09:12	Yoshi2	yup, I put it in my favorites
2016-08-13 13:09:26	@Espyo	of course the comments couldn't survive more than 10 without somebody mentioning INTO YOU

2016-08-13 13:10:09	@Espyo	oh, heh, Snow Halation
2016-08-13 13:12:27	Yoshi2	currently finishing up a video by adding subtitles
2016-08-13 13:14:46	@Espyo	good
2016-08-13 13:15:40	Yoshi2	Aegisub has a feature called "ASSDraw"
2016-08-13 13:16:05	@Espyo	what does it draw?
2016-08-13 13:16:18	Yoshi2	and as its icon it has the face of a character from lucky star
2016-08-13 13:16:58	Yoshi2	I think it's for subtitle-based fancy drawing
2016-08-13 13:17:01	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-13 13:17:04	@Espyo	'fraid the joke is lost on me
2016-08-13 13:17:39	Yoshi2	no particular joke except huehuehue ASS draw huehuehue
2016-08-13 13:17:46	@Espyo	right
2016-08-13 13:17:50	@Espyo	thought so
2016-08-13 13:18:01	@Espyo	hence my question, what does it draw?~~
2016-08-13 13:18:19	Yoshi2	<Yoshi2> I think it's for subtitle-based fancy drawing
2016-08-13 13:18:26	Yoshi2	i.e. stuff that isn't text
2016-08-13 13:18:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-13 13:18:39	Yoshi2	apparently it does vector drawing
2016-08-13 13:18:57	@Espyo	oh, that would make sense, actually
2016-08-13 13:53:13	Yoshi2	dooone
2016-08-13 13:53:21	Yoshi2	turned out to be better/easier than expected
2016-08-13 13:53:57	Yoshi2	now I just need to merge the subtitles into the video because I think youtube doesn't like embedded subs
2016-08-13 13:54:41	@Espyo	youtube doesn't like a lot of things
2016-08-13 13:54:42	@Espyo	good luck
2016-08-13 13:56:42	Yoshi2	it likes my videos
2016-08-13 13:56:54	Yoshi2	it just likes to screw the quality
2016-08-13 13:57:05	@Espyo	it dislikes the quality
2016-08-13 13:58:50	Yoshi2	I saw a trick that TotalBiscuit showed off, where you upscale a video to the next higher quality just to get a bitrate you were supposed to get with your regular quality
2016-08-13 13:59:57	Yoshi2	and I am doing something like that, I think
2016-08-13 14:01:05	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-08-13 14:05:25	Yoshi2	no man's sky is out and it sucks to the suprise of
2016-08-13 14:05:31	Yoshi2	absolutely nobody ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-08-13 14:06:25	@Espyo	hehe yep
2016-08-13 14:06:29	@Espyo	it's incredible
2016-08-13 14:06:36	@Espyo	they just type in "make release pc" on the terminal
2016-08-13 14:06:38	@Espyo	wait for it to compile
2016-08-13 14:06:39	@Espyo	and send it
2016-08-13 14:06:45	@Espyo	"uh, sir, did anybody actually test this on PC?"
2016-08-13 14:06:58	@Espyo	"what are you talking about? it's fine on the PS4, and PCs are usually stronger, so duh"
2016-08-13 14:09:34	Yoshi2	and apparently on ps4 it isn't much better
2016-08-13 14:10:00	@Espyo	the only complaint I've heard on the PS4 is that there's no real multiplayer
2016-08-13 14:10:05	@Espyo	haven't heard anything about performance
2016-08-13 14:10:11	@Espyo	not like I'm searching for reviews, but...
2016-08-13 14:12:58	Yoshi2	I heard there are crashes sometimes
2016-08-13 14:13:46	@Espyo	hah
2016-08-13 14:15:36	Yoshi2	although those appear to only happen when the servers are overloaded
2016-08-13 14:22:04	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-13 14:34:49	Yoshi2	I guess ps4 people like the game
2016-08-13 14:34:58	Yoshi2	sucks that they botchered the pc port
2016-08-13 14:38:13	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-13 14:48:43	Yoshi2	looks like I won't be able to run it even if I wanted because it needs sse4.1

2016-08-13 18:53:39	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-08-13 18:54:11	Scruffy	So, today I was finally able to get a Gatling Groink shot to last long enough to hear more of its sound
2016-08-13 18:54:41	Scruffy	In the Subterranean Complex sublevel 7, there's a Groink on a pedestal near the abyss
2016-08-13 18:55:12	Scruffy	And if a leader stands close enough to the edge, the random deviation of the shots eventually causes one to fall into the abyss
2016-08-13 18:56:07	Scruffy	I realized that each time mortars are fired, two sound modifiers effect the whistling sound played
2016-08-13 18:56:25	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-13 18:56:40	Scruffy	affect*
2016-08-13 18:56:51	@Espyo	are these sound modifiers run by the game itself?
2016-08-13 18:57:03	@Espyo	or were they implanted on the sound and put on the game already modified?
2016-08-13 18:57:19	Scruffy	Yes, the whistling sound is actually very different
2016-08-13 18:57:34	Scruffy	If you've heard Bullet Bills fired in Super Mario Sunshine, it's that exact sound
2016-08-13 18:57:59	Scruffy	So it's put in this game to play as a mortar flies through the air
2016-08-13 18:58:28	Scruffy	One modifier gradually increases its volume to full, so it sounds like its whistling while /falling/, not all the time
2016-08-13 18:59:04	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-08-13 18:59:10	Scruffy	And the other is a frequency oscillator: it's what makes the pitch of the whistle "wobble"
2016-08-13 18:59:27	@Espyo	ah, righ
2016-08-13 18:59:28	@Espyo	*t
2016-08-13 18:59:34	Scruffy	Also, the overall speed of the sound decreases over time
2016-08-13 18:59:35	@Espyo	cool stuff
2016-08-13 18:59:43	@Espyo	does this affect the pitch?
2016-08-13 18:59:49	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-13 19:00:05	Scruffy	There's a point where the pitch stops decreasing
2016-08-13 19:00:25	Scruffy	But it's always oscillating, so it never becomes just one note
2016-08-13 19:01:06	@Espyo	you can probably also make a video of that
2016-08-13 19:01:11	@Espyo	maybe not just that, but other sounds too
2016-08-13 19:01:11	Scruffy	And using this information, I was able to take the raw sound and place those same modifiers on it to the best of my ability in a sound-editing program
2016-08-13 19:01:24	Scruffy	The result is pretty much exactly what you hear in-game
2016-08-13 19:01:28	@Espyo	nice!
2016-08-13 19:01:31	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-13 19:01:41	Scruffy	This will all be on my next video with the other sound info
2016-08-13 19:01:55	@Espyo	great
2016-08-13 19:01:55	Scruffy	I'm almost done with the script and I recorded some footage
2016-08-13 19:02:02	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-08-13 19:02:13	@Espyo	ooh, can't wait then
2016-08-13 19:02:15	@Espyo	any ETA?
2016-08-13 19:02:36	Scruffy	Some time this coming week
2016-08-13 19:02:55	@Espyo	nice
2016-08-13 19:03:25	Scruffy	I just need to get a good place to record the narration
2016-08-13 19:03:44	@Espyo	what'd you use on the title screen video?
2016-08-13 19:04:32	@Espyo	...wait, what
2016-08-13 19:04:38	@Espyo	"i came from Barry (Game Grumps) on twitter﻿"
2016-08-13 19:04:44	@Espyo	this is a comment on your title screen video
2016-08-13 19:04:49	@Espyo	there is absolutely NO way Barry talked about this video
2016-08-13 19:04:52	@Espyo	like

2016-08-13 19:05:10	@Espyo	if Barry from the Game Grumps posted about this, you'd have at least 60 k
2016-08-13 19:05:10	Testyo	60 K = -213.15 °C / -351.67 °F
2016-08-13 19:05:15	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-13 19:06:55	Scruffy	For that video I recorded the narration in my dorm, under my bed, because I didn't have anywhere that shuts out noise as well :P
2016-08-13 19:07:23	Scruffy	I have a good location in mind this time, but I won't be able to go until this coming week
2016-08-13 19:07:54	@Espyo	oh, yeah, I remember that
2016-08-13 19:08:10	@Espyo	the work you put into these things is a bit unappreciated
2016-08-13 19:08:19	@Espyo	but, I guess the more you put out, the more people appreciate it
2016-08-13 19:08:39	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-13 19:08:50	@Espyo	KAJSDHKJASGDJWH WHAT?!
2016-08-13 19:08:56	@Espyo	HE DID?! https://twitter.com/razzadoop/status/705464163414355968
2016-08-13 19:09:14	@Espyo	holy... holy shit
2016-08-13 19:09:16	@Espyo	I actually can't believe this
2016-08-13 19:09:29	@Espyo	why is it so underlooked though...?
2016-08-13 19:09:46	Scruffy	Wow, that's pretty insane!
2016-08-13 19:10:07	@Espyo	guess it must be Twitter's filtering system
2016-08-13 19:10:19	@Espyo	it made it so only a small percentage of Barry's followers ever got to see the tweet
2016-08-13 19:10:33	@Espyo	he has a ridiculous amount, more than warrants 300 likes
2016-08-13 19:53:07	@Espyo	why is g++ letting me create functions that are meant to return something, but don't?
2016-08-13 19:53:21	@Espyo	C++ definitely does not allow that, so why is the compiler letting me instead of throwing warnings?
2016-08-13 19:53:36	@Espyo	ugh, the visual studio compiler loves throwing a hissy fit over the smallest thing
2016-08-13 19:53:42	@Espyo	this compiler doesn't throw enough hissy fits
2016-08-13 19:59:03	@J	I think C has a default return value, not sure about C++
2016-08-13 19:59:33	@Espyo	it looked like it just gave a random behavior to me
2016-08-13 19:59:46	@J	I guess pass -Wall
2016-08-13 19:59:52	@Espyo	I really should, eh?
2016-08-13 20:00:04	@Espyo	oh, wait, I remembered I can't, because it complains about a lot of things inside Allegro
2016-08-13 20:00:14	@J	Scruffy, this video is great, I never saw it before
2016-08-13 20:00:30	@Espyo	hm, at least it used to be that way on visual studio, and this IDE isn't very good at understanding Allegro
2016-08-13 20:00:33	@Espyo	I'll give it a shot
2016-08-13 20:02:03	@Espyo	hey, that worked great
2016-08-13 20:02:08	@Espyo	turns out it does know that it shouldn't let me do it
2016-08-13 20:02:12	@Espyo	but it's only a warning, not an error
2016-08-13 20:02:14	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-13 20:02:34	@J	you can do individual ones, like -Wreturn-type
2016-08-13 20:02:47	@J	I think -Werror turns warnings into errors
2016-08-13 20:02:47	@Espyo	hm, I think I knew that
2016-08-13 20:03:03	@Espyo	it'll be worth looking into one day, I think
2016-08-13 20:03:19	@Espyo	but for now, I just want the compiler to at least tell me when I'm asking for the destruction of the world :/
2016-08-13 20:03:46	@J	I think there's some way to hide warnings from libraries
2016-08-13 20:03:50	@J	by including them differently
2016-08-13 20:04:19	Testyo	:| okay sorry
2016-08-13 20:04:22	@J	by referencing the path on the command-line differently, I mean
2016-08-13 20:04:30	@J	wow Testyo, no need to take offence
2016-08-13 20:04:30	Testyo	cause like, in voice chat, you can't go back and look at what they just said
2016-08-13 20:04:39	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-08-13 20:15:27	Scruffy	Thank you J!

2016-08-13 20:27:08	@Espyo	Marty2000: https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0ewopNt5Q can you help me find the glitch here?
2016-08-13 20:27:37	@Espyo	that user likes to post glitches (dat username)
2016-08-13 20:27:42	@Espyo	but they never explain what they are
2016-08-13 20:27:43	@Espyo	it's a bit annoying
2016-08-13 20:28:23	Marty2000	Yes, I'm going to check
2016-08-13 20:30:02	Marty2000	I can't see it, to be honest
2016-08-13 20:30:34	@Espyo	*shrug* I guess we can forget it then
2016-08-13 20:31:03	Marty2000	I'll ask by posting a comment
2016-08-13 20:31:47	Scruffy	Perhaps it's the strange assortment of Red Pikmin on Alph's side?
2016-08-13 20:32:03	Scruffy	They don't appear to be digging anything
2016-08-13 20:32:32	Scruffy	By the way, I don't know if we already knew this but digging speed in P2 appears to be related to attack power
2016-08-13 20:32:37	Marty2000	At this spot, if I recall correctly, you have some buried Pikmi,
2016-08-13 20:32:43	Marty2000	Yes it is
2016-08-13 20:32:50	Yoshi2	maybe digging is just a form of attacking
2016-08-13 20:32:52	Marty2000	Same for P3

2016-08-13 21:02:41	Yoshi2	uh
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	that's bingo but each player has a second leader?
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	how
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	Espyo Marty2000 how
2016-08-13 21:02:42	@Espyo	yeah, Bingo Battle lets you control 1 or 2 leaders per player
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	hm, I always only had 1 leader per player
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	is it the 4 player thing?
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	I always picked 2 players
2016-08-13 21:02:42	@Espyo	there's no 4 player thing
2016-08-13 21:02:42	@Espyo	it's just an option before you enter Bingo Battle
2016-08-13 21:02:42	@Espyo	you sure you're not thinking of Pikmin 2's 2-Player Battle?
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	i am not thinking of pikmin 2's 2 player battle because i litterally never played that game in multiplayer
2016-08-13 21:02:42	Yoshi2	but there was an option with 2 or 4 something and I might've interpreted that as 2 or 4 players
2016-08-13 21:02:42	@Espyo	hm, probably
2016-08-13 21:02:50	Yoshi2	nice timing scruffy

2016-08-13 21:04:06	Marty2000	She answered
2016-08-13 21:04:42	Marty2000	Well, it's not very surprising for us, since it's quite a common  thing in the series
2016-08-13 21:04:48	Marty2000	... isn't it? :p
2016-08-13 21:09:49	Yoshi2	would need to try and see how easy it is to have two corpses intersect
2016-08-13 21:10:30	Marty2000	It is very common
2016-08-13 21:10:37	Marty2000	Can you confirm, Espyo?
2016-08-13 21:10:47	Marty2000	Especially in P2
2016-08-13 21:10:53	Marty2000	But it's still common in P3 as well
2016-08-13 21:11:02	@Espyo	YAWN
2016-08-13 21:11:06	@Espyo	yeah, that's super common
2016-08-13 21:12:28	Yoshi2	ah, so we did not see the forest because of the trees
2016-08-13 21:12:38	Yoshi2	the glitch is so common we did not see it as a glitch
2016-08-13 21:13:10	Marty2000	Well, I wouldn't say it's a glitch
2016-08-13 21:13:34	Marty2000	Or if it's one, it's very likely on Pikipedia
2016-08-13 21:14:17	Marty2000	... but I'd say it's something as normal as throwing a Pikmin (so, it's not a glitch)
2016-08-13 21:15:07	@Espyo	I can barely see any clipping on that image anyway
2016-08-13 21:15:32	Marty2000	Same

2016-08-13 22:21:29	Yoshi2	there are 3 types of costumes hidden in this one dungeon in neptunia rebirt 3, and the dungeon is long and each type of costume is hidden further away from the exit than the previous one
2016-08-13 22:21:43	Yoshi2	and it's random, so you MIGHT get it or not
2016-08-13 22:22:06	Yoshi2	and if you don't get it, you have to reenter the dungeon and walk all the way again
2016-08-13 22:22:22	Yoshi2	now that you have the context, try to guess the order in which the following types appear in the dungeon:
2016-08-13 22:22:41	Yoshi2	swimwear, maid, cosplay
2016-08-13 22:23:18	@Espyo	cosplay, maid, swimwear
2016-08-13 22:23:41	Yoshi2	you got the right idea, it's maid-cosplay-swimwear

2016-08-14 17:07:57	Marty2000	I don't think it's a glitch, but rather something that was changed on purpose for the Wii version

2016-08-14 17:08:06	@Espyo	is it something that happens every time?

2016-08-14 17:09:08	Marty2000	shouldn't we modify the infobox afterwards?

2016-08-14 17:22:00	Marty2000	Yes, sure, will check
2016-08-14 17:23:36	Marty2000	I see what you mean, but I don't need to modify the list here, since nothing changes but the sublevel (the cave is still the same) ;)
2016-08-14 17:24:00	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-08-14 17:25:59	Marty2000	I'll check what I could modify, though
2016-08-14 17:27:23	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Treasure#List_of_treasures
2016-08-14 17:27:26	Marty2000	So for example...
2016-08-14 17:27:34	Marty2000	For the Crystal King
2016-08-14 17:28:03	Marty2000	I should split it since it has another number on another version, right?
2016-08-14 17:28:12	@Espyo	yeah, definitely
2016-08-14 17:28:15	@Espyo	wait
2016-08-14 17:28:18	@Espyo	no, not for the number
2016-08-14 17:28:39	Marty2000	I see. Only when the location changes
2016-08-14 17:28:40	Marty2000	?
2016-08-14 17:28:49	@Espyo	location, or Poko count, or any other element on that table that's not the number
2016-08-14 17:28:52	Marty2000	(or series, value...)
2016-08-14 17:28:55	@Espyo	since we can already represent different region numbers
2016-08-14 17:28:56	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-14 17:29:02	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-08-14 17:37:10	Marty2000	I think there's nothing else to change, besides the description for the Time Capsule ( "	Locket with a corgi dog picture " ). I'd add "or a house cat on the Japanese version'. It's minor, but otherwise there's (probably) nothing else to change
2016-08-14 17:43:48	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-08-14 17:43:51	@Espyo	I hope so
2016-08-14 17:44:59	Marty2000	I'm still verifying, because I'm not sure :p but from memory, I see no other difference...
2016-08-14 17:48:52	Marty2000	Also...
2016-08-14 17:49:02	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Flame_of_Tomorrow
2016-08-14 17:49:04	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fire_Hope
2016-08-14 17:49:28	Marty2000	To be honest, I think we should maybe merge those articles
2016-08-14 17:49:38	Marty2000	Like for those:
2016-08-14 17:49:40	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Time_Capsule
2016-08-14 17:49:45	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Decorative_Goo
2016-08-14 17:50:01	Marty2000	To me, it seems to be the same treasure with just a different number.
2016-08-14 17:51:09	@Espyo	definitely agreed
2016-08-14 17:51:51	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Treasure We'll need to modify this as well, then ;)
2016-08-14 17:51:57	Marty2000	Well, the table
2016-08-14 17:52:05	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-14 17:53:39	Marty2000	I can merge the articles, but I need to know if I should delete the Japanese description for the Fire Hope (which is the same as that of the Flame of Tomorrow)
2016-08-14 17:54:06	Marty2000	Then, I should put a redirect for "Fire Hope" to "Flame of Tomorrow"
2016-08-14 17:54:47	@Espyo	yeah, turn it into a redir
2016-08-14 17:55:02	@Espyo	[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Fire Hope]]

2016-08-14 17:55:18	@Espyo	should be a good idea to edit all articles that link to "Fire Hope" and make them link to "Flame of Tomorrow" instead
2016-08-14 17:55:36	@Espyo	oh, and on the Flame of Tomorrow article, write down the Japanese name and what it translates too
2016-08-14 17:56:11	Marty2000	Sure
2016-08-14 17:56:22	Marty2000	I'm going to eat I'll do that when I get back
2016-08-14 17:56:27	@Espyo	okay
2016-08-14 18:10:03	Marty2000	Okay, going to move it.
2016-08-14 18:11:03	Marty2000	I mean, merge

2016-08-14 22:22:28	Marty2000	I understand, yeah
2016-08-14 22:25:48	Marty2000	A weapon that I found particularly bothersome with lag is the N-Zap

2016-08-15 11:19:11	Yoshi2	ugh, currently messing with OBS again and something is broken
2016-08-15 11:19:51	@Espyo	what's up?
2016-08-15 11:19:54	Yoshi2	key combinations don't work
2016-08-15 11:19:57	Yoshi2	or rather
2016-08-15 11:20:04	Yoshi2	any key in a key combination triggers the action
2016-08-15 11:20:10	Yoshi2	which is NOT what I want
2016-08-15 11:22:59	@Espyo	so you're seeing your key configs are thinking A OR B instead of A AND B?
2016-08-15 11:23:16	Yoshi2	yup
2016-08-15 11:23:34	Yoshi2	oh
2016-08-15 11:23:54	Yoshi2	you are supposed to press the keys at once to have it register as A AND B
2016-08-15 11:24:04	Yoshi2	if you add more keys with the + button, that will be A OR B

2016-08-15 11:36:35	@Espyo	they like it, but because it's not the umpteenth Fleentstones, they "hate" it
2016-08-15 11:37:45	Yoshi2	my favorite silvagunner rips are those that aren't the same thing over and over again
2016-08-15 11:38:51	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-15 11:39:37	Yoshi2	ok, time to record a thing

2016-08-15 12:15:14	@Espyo	with cuts?
2016-08-15 12:16:19	Yoshi2	I might speed up a part of it
2016-08-15 12:38:23	@Espyo	yikes
2016-08-15 12:38:28	@Espyo	texture blending really does make a big difference
2016-08-15 12:40:01	Yoshi2	I am not sure if it is called texture blending, that is a term I heard in dota2 modding for something that is pretty similar so I used it here
2016-08-15 12:41:16	Yoshi2	it's about textures and textures are sort of blended together to make one continuous terrain texture -> texture blending ¯\(ツ)/¯  
2016-08-15 12:41:18	@Espyo	well, it seems about right
2016-08-15 12:41:24	@Espyo	I've got a really similar thing going on with the engine
2016-08-15 12:46:37	@Espyo	cool stuff
2016-08-15 12:46:57	Yoshi2	the next thing I've planned will be even cooler
2016-08-15 12:47:05	@Espyo	good
2016-08-15 12:47:09	Yoshi2	no more boring "3x terrain height" stuff
2016-08-15 12:47:36	Yoshi2	100% custom terrain (well, almost 100%)
2016-08-15 12:48:36	@Espyo	sweet
2016-08-15 12:54:52	Yoshi2	no custom textures, that is something for another day
2016-08-15 12:55:37	@Espyo	right

2016-08-15 13:24:28	@Espyo	right, I saw that on the upload list
2016-08-15 13:24:39	@Espyo	and I just assumed it'd be silence, and/or quotes of him talking about multiplayer
2016-08-15 13:24:42	@Espyo	so I never bothered to see
2016-08-15 13:24:46	@Espyo	but damn, do I regret it
2016-08-15 13:24:47	@Espyo	this is beautiful
2016-08-15 13:26:51	Yoshi2	it's kinda both silence and quotes about multiplayer but it is well made
2016-08-15 13:30:23	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-15 13:31:17	Yoshi2	ok, let's see if my changes work

2016-08-15 14:07:52	Yoshi2	what the FUCK
2016-08-15 14:08:03	Yoshi2	I added a zone so it won't out of bounds me in one place

2016-08-15 14:53:18	@Espyo	did nobody, at any point in time, ever need to create an algorithm that fills cells on a grid according to neighbors?
2016-08-15 14:53:23	@Espyo	am I literally the only human that needed to do so?
2016-08-15 14:53:24	@Espyo	sheesh
2016-08-15 14:53:27	@Espyo	no results on googgle
2016-08-15 14:53:28	@Espyo	*google
2016-08-15 14:53:55	@Espyo	you start with a filled cell on the center of the grid
2016-08-15 14:54:07	@Espyo	then randomly pick a side of that cell
2016-08-15 14:54:10	@Espyo	and plop a new one there
2016-08-15 14:54:21	@Espyo	then randomly pick between the two cells, find a free neighboring side, and place a new cell there
2016-08-15 14:54:36	@Espyo	then randomly pick between the three cells, find a free neighboring side, and place a new cell there
2016-08-15 14:54:36	@Espyo	etc.
2016-08-15 14:54:44	@Espyo	but there has to be a better way to optimize this
2016-08-15 14:54:51	@Espyo	every new cell you add is a LOT of calculations
2016-08-15 14:55:09	@Espyo	finding which cells can still accept neighbors
2016-08-15 14:55:24	@Espyo	which means going through the whole list just to see which cells have coordinates adjacent to that cell
2016-08-15 14:55:34	@Espyo	then randomly pick between that list of candidates
2016-08-15 14:55:37	@Espyo	then randomly pick a side to place it on
2016-08-15 14:55:44	@Espyo	there has to be an easier way
2016-08-15 15:10:24	Yoshi2	Espyo: the question is
2016-08-15 15:10:26	Yoshi2	what for?
2016-08-15 15:10:58	@Espyo	it's for that Splatoon thing I'm doing
2016-08-15 15:11:05	@Espyo	so, I can't really provide context
2016-08-15 15:11:14	Yoshi2	you could keep a list of free spots as you add cells which should save you the effort of calculating who accepts neighbours
2016-08-15 15:11:32	@Espyo	yeah, that was my initial approach
2016-08-15 15:11:39	@Espyo	and it looks like it's the only available one, really...
2016-08-15 15:12:46	Yoshi2	what you do sounds like BFS/DFS
2016-08-15 15:12:57	Yoshi2	except there is no preference for going deep or wide
2016-08-15 15:13:05	@Espyo	hm, yeah...

2016-08-15 15:16:27	Yoshi2	seems like tree traversal except your tree is a grid of cells with each cell having 4 neighbours (or 8 if you count diagonal)
2016-08-15 15:17:15	@Espyo	(not counting diagonals)

2016-08-15 16:37:38	Marty2000	I don't know what happened for those screenshots, but it asked me to choose that, so I selected {{screenshot}}
2016-08-15 16:37:39	Testyo	"screenshot" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:screenshot
2016-08-15 16:37:47	Marty2000	even though there was screenshot in the table...
2016-08-15 16:37:53	Marty2000	Thanks for modifying anyway
2016-08-15 16:38:10	Marty2000	I wasn't sure whether I'd have to remove them
2016-08-15 16:38:19	@Espyo	yeah, next time that happens, remove them
2016-08-15 16:38:23	@Espyo	since they're already on the table
2016-08-15 16:38:27	@Espyo	I don't understand why it would ask you
2016-08-15 16:38:31	@Espyo	ugh, I think it's the wiki's fault
2016-08-15 16:38:34	@Espyo	it doesn't like scripts much
2016-08-15 16:38:38	@Espyo	sometimes it doesn't load them properly
2016-08-15 16:38:47	@Espyo	and you get a mix between the classic upload page and the script's page
2016-08-15 16:39:11	Marty2000	Yeah, sometimes I get that (so, I have to close the page and open it again)
2016-08-15 16:39:23	Marty2000	But it's not a big problem
2016-08-15 16:39:39	Marty2000	Anyway, be right back, I'm going to eat something.

2016-08-15 17:09:54	Marty2000	I'd say between 5 and 10

2016-08-15 18:00:17	Yoshi2	;)
2016-08-15 18:00:41	Yoshi2	in 2 hours we can do the you-know-what thing ;) ;) ;)
2016-08-15 18:00:51	Marty2000	Some stuff
2016-08-15 18:04:22	Marty2000	Also, the testfire for Splatoon is coming back
2016-08-15 18:04:58	@Espyo	?
2016-08-15 18:05:23	Marty2000	Did you participate to the two testfires last year, Espyo?
2016-08-15 18:05:28	Marty2000	Before Splatoon got released
2016-08-15 18:05:44	Marty2000	a special demo (Splatoon Global Testfire) was released on the Eshop
2016-08-15 18:05:56	Marty2000	which allowed players to play Splatoon during certain hours
2016-08-15 18:06:02	Marty2000	a second demo was released in August
2016-08-15 18:06:07	@Espyo	I did
2016-08-15 18:06:15	Marty2000	a third one is going to be released at the end of the month
2016-08-15 18:06:22	@Espyo	but
2016-08-15 18:06:26	@Espyo	the game's already been launched...
2016-08-15 18:06:27	Marty2000	I'll participate, just to serve as a Bubbler fountain, nothing else :p
2016-08-15 18:06:41	Marty2000	Yeah, but some people still do not have it...
2016-08-15 18:06:41	@Espyo	is there any new feature coming?
2016-08-15 18:06:45	@Espyo	guess so
2016-08-15 18:07:02	Marty2000	I don't think any new feature is coming
2016-08-15 18:07:09	Marty2000	besides updates to fix new glitches
2016-08-15 18:07:14	@Espyo	right
2016-08-15 18:07:31	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/ACnnOm4QlKQ
2016-08-15 18:08:35	@Espyo	hm, I see
2016-08-15 18:09:15	Yoshi2	interesting, this game has a costume that makes the belly of a character no longer transparent, but as an exchange it reveals more of the back (down to slighly above the butt) ...
2016-08-15 18:09:22	Yoshi2	i will leave the judgement up to you
2016-08-15 18:10:09	@Espyo	hey, depends on what you're into
2016-08-15 18:10:13	@Espyo	some people really prefer the belly button region
2016-08-15 18:13:31	Yoshi2	and every one of the special costumes cost 500k credits
2016-08-15 18:13:31	Testyo	500 K = 226.85 °C / 440.33 °F
2016-08-15 18:14:09	Yoshi2	for reference, you get 1 million credits at the end of a playthrough if you do some things correctly 
2016-08-15 18:14:30	@Espyo	woah
2016-08-15 18:14:45	@Espyo	can't say it doesn't have replayability...
2016-08-15 18:15:06	Yoshi2	this is not a game you 100% easily
2016-08-15 18:15:14	@Espyo	I can see that
2016-08-15 18:15:19	Yoshi2	presumably, there are late game dungeons that allow you to amass lots of money, but I didn't get to those yet
2016-08-15 18:15:40	Yoshi2	well, I am finishing the "True Ending" now and will probably be done with the game for a while
2016-08-15 18:20:13	Yoshi2	there is a video project that wants to be finished
2016-08-15 18:22:22	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-15 18:26:53	Yoshi2	oh wow, this game has weird issues when it is close to running out of memory
2016-08-15 18:27:32	@Espyo	lolwut
2016-08-15 18:30:28	Yoshi2	The Game Used "Suicide Bomber"!
2016-08-15 18:30:41	Yoshi2	The Game Died And Took Hexchat and Chrome with it!
2016-08-15 18:31:05	Yoshi2	and steam
2016-08-15 18:32:18	@Espyo	brill
2016-08-15 18:32:29	@Espyo	and nothing else?
2016-08-15 18:32:51	Yoshi2	hexchat/chrome/steam is already too much
2016-08-15 18:33:12	@Espyo	it is
2016-08-15 18:33:31	Yoshi2	also, now I have to go through the cutscene again, hnnggg

2016-08-15 18:34:53	Yoshi2	leeet's try gain....
2016-08-15 18:40:54	Yoshi2	on a different note, I'm quite enjoying doing voice recording for my video for some reason
2016-08-15 18:41:30	Yoshi2	might have something to do with realizing "oh hey I don't sound like complete shit when talking"
2016-08-15 18:42:43	@Espyo	yeah

2016-08-15 20:08:46	@Espyo	okay

2016-08-15 21:00:31	Yoshi2	when I pronounce "thousand" it sounds so German it hurts
2016-08-15 21:00:54	@Espyo	vouzahnd?
2016-08-15 21:02:34	Yoshi2	Tausend
2016-08-15 21:03:06	@Espyo	well, you can try a really exaggerated "uuuhhh" on "thousuuuuhhhnd"
2016-08-15 21:03:08	@Espyo	that should be enough
2016-08-15 21:07:53	Yoshi2	that would mean re-recording this though 
2016-08-15 21:08:04	@Espyo	you can just replace one word
2016-08-15 21:08:08	@Espyo	do some Audacity magic
2016-08-15 21:10:43	Yoshi2	re-recording would be easier than making THAT work
2016-08-15 21:11:19	@Espyo	really?
2016-08-15 21:11:23	@Espyo	Audacity always works fine for me
2016-08-15 21:12:32	Yoshi2	I meant replacing the word and having it not sound out of place
2016-08-15 21:12:47	@Espyo	hm, guess so
2016-08-15 21:13:17	@Espyo	"Over here, I have increased this value by one T H O U S A N D units."
2016-08-15 21:23:29	Yoshi2	I am breathing a bit while speaking, so if I swap out a word it will be noticable
2016-08-15 21:23:53	@Espyo	oh, right
2016-08-15 21:23:54	@Espyo	oh well
2016-08-15 21:25:23	Yoshi2	I can swap out a portion of the stuff I said though, because I recorded 5 different tracks, one per line I spoke
2016-08-15 21:27:05	Yoshi2	"The meter is not a visual measure. It is an arbitrary measure based on arbitrary numbers that are not easy or possible to visualize. It was created with one purpose... being base 10. Base 10 is terrible to measure with." man if only you could imagine my face right now
2016-08-15 21:27:14	Yoshi2	and yet i cannot stop reading that stuff on reddit
2016-08-15 21:27:59	Yoshi2	https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4xsq7v/usain_bolt_and_the_fastest_men_in_the_world_since/d6ieynv
2016-08-15 21:30:21	Yoshi2	i will just assume it's a troll, easier to live my life that way
2016-08-15 21:45:22	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-08-15 21:45:43	@Espyo	yeah, it's reddit
2016-08-15 21:45:49	@Espyo	no use losing breath over it
2016-08-15 21:47:00	Yoshi2	my first attempt to apply my recorded audio over the video was a success
2016-08-15 21:47:14	Yoshi2	it even fits the video well enough
2016-08-15 21:50:35	@Espyo	great!
2016-08-15 22:09:27	Yoshi2	I might try recording some of the lines again though

2016-08-16 19:18:49	Marty2000	"Although the idea is for fans to create their own content (enemies, areas, etc.) so the engine can read it and turn it into a game, the current download also comes with some pre-packaged content, which makes it possible for people who download it to experiment its features."

2016-08-16 19:28:29	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-16 19:28:31	@Espyo	yeah, I've seen
2016-08-16 19:28:34	@Espyo	amazing video, Scruffy!
2016-08-16 19:28:36	@Espyo	I love it so much
2016-08-16 19:30:27	Scruffy	Thank you Espyo!
2016-08-16 19:30:43	@Espyo	only found ooooooone problem...
2016-08-16 19:30:48	@Espyo	"Awakening Woods"
2016-08-16 19:30:54	@Espyo	it's Awakening Wood ;)
2016-08-16 19:31:00	Scruffy	Shoot
2016-08-16 19:31:12	Scruffy	I should have caught that, thanks :P
2016-08-16 19:31:18	@Espyo	hehe
2016-08-16 19:31:25	@Espyo	other than that, is that really how you pronounce ad infinitum?
2016-08-16 19:31:28	@Espyo	I can't find any consensus
2016-08-16 19:31:52	@Espyo	I just pronounce it the way one supposedly would in Latin, AHd infinit(e)-- OOm
2016-08-16 19:31:52	Scruffy	That's how I was taught
2016-08-16 19:31:57	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-08-16 19:32:18	@Espyo	anyway, it gathered quite a lot of views and likes in a really small amount of time
2016-08-16 19:32:20	@Espyo	I'm so happy
2016-08-16 19:32:29	Scruffy	Yeah! I'm glad it's doing well
2016-08-16 19:32:51	@Espyo	if you can make similar videos for other franchises too, I can see a lot of people checking them out
2016-08-16 19:33:01	@Espyo	because, in the end, players who don't care about Pikmin probably won't even bother to open the video
2016-08-16 19:33:08	@Espyo	although the stuff there doesn't require much Pikmin knowledge
2016-08-16 19:33:28	@Espyo	if you could also tweak the script to be a bit more accepting of gamers in general, instead of mostly Pikmin 2 players, I think that'd also be powerful
2016-08-16 19:33:35	@Espyo	something to keep in mind for the next videos, maybe?
2016-08-16 19:35:07	Scruffy	Good idea
2016-08-16 19:39:58	Scruffy	Creative Sushi, in a week, is going to give me the files of Pikmin 3

2016-08-16 19:40:13	Scruffy	So maybe I could look through that as well and make a more general video about it
2016-08-16 19:40:51	@Espyo	nice
2016-08-16 19:40:59	@Espyo	there's no known way to open the sound files, though
2016-08-16 19:41:25	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-08-16 19:41:55	Scruffy	Well, I could at least have a look at the lighting files again, those are really interesting
2016-08-16 19:44:51	@Espyo	mhm
2016-08-16 19:45:03	@Espyo	there's still a LOT to find in Pikmin 3's files

2016-08-16 22:31:39	Scruffy	Hi everyone!
2016-08-16 22:31:43	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-16 22:31:47	@Espyo	as you can see...!
2016-08-16 22:31:49	@Espyo	you were right after all
2016-08-16 22:31:51	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-16 22:32:39	@Espyo	hey, one thing
2016-08-16 22:32:49	@Espyo	can you give me more detail on the sucking-up noise that's in NSMBU?
2016-08-16 22:33:01	Scruffy	You mean Super Mario 3D World/
2016-08-16 22:33:03	@Espyo	and, you know, also in Occupational Hazards?
2016-08-16 22:33:03	Scruffy	?
2016-08-16 22:33:06	@Espyo	yeah...that
2016-08-16 22:33:10	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-16 22:33:18	@Espyo	I honestly can't keep up with the naming scheme of Mario games nowadays >_>
2016-08-16 22:33:41	@Espyo	I want to add it to the wiki, since we already list what other sound effects from other places play in the short movies
2016-08-16 22:33:50	@Espyo	and I'd like to know exactly when in SM3DW that plays
2016-08-16 22:33:54	Scruffy	It appears in SM3DW during the battle with Prince Bully, the enemy I drew in the video
2016-08-16 22:33:58	@Espyo	and also, when it plays on Occupational Hazards, please
2016-08-16 22:34:10	@Espyo	ah, for any particular action?
2016-08-16 22:34:28	Scruffy	When you kick it into the clear pipes, it gets sucked into them, and when it comes out another pipe, it makes that noise
2016-08-16 22:34:57	Scruffy	It's squeezed into a can shape that you can kick
2016-08-16 22:35:11	Scruffy	So it makes that noise to show that it underwent the shape change and is now vulnerable
2016-08-16 22:35:47	Scruffy	In Occupational Hazards, it plays every time the Hocotate research pod sucks up a nut or bolt in the pile

2016-08-16 23:45:07	@PikFan	okay
2016-08-16 23:45:11	@PikFan	so I want to warn you
2016-08-16 23:45:22	@PikFan	some of the users on there are ADAMANTLY AGAINST night mode
2016-08-16 23:45:35	Scruffy	Oh, yeah, I've noticed from the Pikipedia forums
2016-08-16 23:45:44	Scruffy	even the mention of the word sets people off
2016-08-16 23:45:48	Scruffy	term*
2016-08-16 23:45:51	@PikFan	it's ridiculous
2016-08-16 23:46:24	Marty2000	Yes.
2016-08-16 23:46:48	@Espyo	you just have to use the right words
2016-08-16 23:46:53	@Espyo	don't be overly aggressive
2016-08-16 23:46:58	@Espyo	in fact, that's just a general rule anywhere, really
2016-08-16 23:47:02	@PikFan	right
2016-08-16 23:47:09	@Espyo	but at some points, I did discuss some possibilities of night mode, and they never really lashed on me
2016-08-16 23:47:15	@Espyo	plus, they have seen one or two good ideas for night mode
2016-08-16 23:47:18	@PikFan	that's cause they respect you
2016-08-16 23:47:35	@PikFan	so basically whatever you say is law :P
2016-08-16 23:47:38	@Espyo	it's just that the vast majority of fans have horrible ideas for a night mode
2016-08-16 23:47:43	@Espyo	...I want to trust that's not the case
2016-08-16 23:47:59	@Espyo	I want to trust that it's more because the most I ever said was like 10 words on that subject
2016-08-16 23:48:07	@Espyo	can't remember what, but I remember I never had any strong opinion or idea for night mode
2016-08-16 23:48:11	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-16 23:48:45	Scruffy	Oh, Espyo, I wanted to ask permission
2016-08-16 23:48:55	Scruffy	To make Pikmin Color Splash into a game
2016-08-16 23:49:00	Scruffy	On Pikmin Fanon
2016-08-16 23:49:26	Scruffy	I just have to many ideas for how it could work
2016-08-16 23:49:40	Scruffy	I feel it's a great joke
2016-08-16 23:49:41	@Espyo	it's not my game, so go ahead :P
2016-08-16 23:49:43	@Espyo	it's everybody's game
2016-08-16 23:49:46	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-16 23:49:48	@Espyo	I'd say
2016-08-16 23:49:49	Scruffy	Cool
2016-08-16 23:49:55	@Espyo	but at least on my part, go nuts
2016-08-16 23:50:03	@Espyo	use any idea I've made at will
2016-08-16 23:50:41	Scruffy	Alrighty
2016-08-16 23:51:25	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-16 23:51:43	@PikFan	but yeah I'm not really a fan of the indirect confirmation
2016-08-16 23:51:56	@PikFan	just cause it's not for Wii U or 3DS doesn't mean it will be for NX
2016-08-16 23:52:06	@Espyo	I'm only not a fan because Nintendo, lately, is starting to sound like 8-year olds
2016-08-16 23:52:10	@Espyo	the kind you ask "do you know what this is?"
2016-08-16 23:52:12	@PikFan	it could be for something post-NX
2016-08-16 23:52:13	@Espyo	and they answer "yeah"
2016-08-16 23:52:15	@Espyo	"what is it?"
2016-08-16 23:52:17	@Espyo	"I don't know"
2016-08-16 23:52:22	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-08-16 23:52:26	@Espyo	same deal with Nintendo, particularly Miyamoto, it seems
2016-08-16 23:52:50	@Espyo	but, like I said, the sales report thing is still objective fact
2016-08-16 23:52:53	@Espyo	and should go on the wiki
2016-08-16 23:52:59	@Espyo	ESPECIALLY considering it's info for Pikmin 4
2016-08-16 23:53:04	@Espyo	we need any bit of info we can get
2016-08-16 23:53:09	@Espyo	so long as it's objective
2016-08-16 23:53:12	@Espyo	doesn't matter if it's just fodder
2016-08-16 23:53:17	@Espyo	(am...I using that word right?)
2016-08-16 23:53:32	@Espyo	(I know I never learned its definition, but for some reason, it jumped on my mind earlier today and hasn't left yet)
2016-08-16 23:54:03	@Espyo	(it's the word I wanted, though probably not the best word for that scenario...!)
2016-08-16 23:54:25	Scruffy	Fodder wokrs
2016-08-16 23:54:27	Scruffy	works*
2016-08-16 23:55:04	@Espyo	so, I assume cannon fodder means thousands of dead bodies?
2016-08-16 23:55:12	@Espyo	wait
2016-08-16 23:55:16	@Espyo	I thought cannon was canyon for a second
2016-08-16 23:55:21	@Espyo	eesh, lemme gather my thoughts here
2016-08-16 23:56:36	Scruffy	yes, cannon fodder is people or materials thought to be expendable
2016-08-16 23:56:53	@Espyo	ok, so I wasn't completely off
2016-08-16 23:56:58	Scruffy	fodder generally means something that is only good for one purpose
2016-08-16 23:57:10	Scruffy	or dried hay for feeding livestock :P
2016-08-16 23:57:13	@Espyo	my idea of "canyon fodder" would be expendable combat units that die by the thousandfold, and whose bodies are basically good for filling canyons
2016-08-16 23:57:24	@Espyo	either my imagination is wild, or my thought is based off of something...
2016-08-16 23:57:40	@PikFan	heheheheh
2016-08-16 23:57:43	@PikFan	so morbid

2016-08-16 23:57:59	@Espyo	war ain't pretty...
2016-08-16 23:58:03	@Espyo	Fire Emblem sure drove that in

2016-08-17 00:02:19	Marty2000	I must hear that sound again
2016-08-17 00:02:25	Marty2000	I feel like it's in Wii Party :p
2016-08-17 00:03:06	@Espyo	probably is!
2016-08-17 00:03:13	Marty2000	Yep, very likely
2016-08-17 00:03:26	Marty2000	Let me try to find that sound in Wii Party... will use Youtube

2016-08-17 00:06:41	Scruffy	It is the same sound!
2016-08-17 00:06:57	Marty2000	Cool!
2016-08-17 00:09:32	Scruffy	So I guess that sound was made before Pikmin 3 and SM3DW
2016-08-17 00:12:02	@PikFan	wait, where should we discuss our open world game
2016-08-17 00:12:08	Marty2000	Yep
2016-08-17 00:12:13	@PikFan	we could discuss it here, where our ideas would be safe
2016-08-17 00:12:16	Marty2000	I think Wii Party was released in 2009
2016-08-17 00:12:29	Scruffy	That's true
2016-08-17 00:12:40	@PikFan	or we could discuss it in discord, where they'd be subject to criticism, but also potential new ideas
2016-08-17 00:12:42	Scruffy	no night mode persecution
2016-08-17 00:12:44	Scruffy	True
2016-08-17 00:13:04	@PikFan	I don't understand what's wrong with night mode
2016-08-17 00:13:12	@PikFan	I really don't
2016-08-17 00:14:05	Scruffy	yeah
2016-08-17 00:14:29	@PikFan	this is probably just my naïveté talking, but what's wrong with staying on the surface?
2016-08-17 00:14:35	@PikFan	you'd still have to sleep
2016-08-17 00:14:53	Scruffy	That's true
2016-08-17 00:14:58	@PikFan	and what's wrong with creating bases?
2016-08-17 00:15:01	Scruffy	But it's kind of like sleeping in Minecraft
2016-08-17 00:15:24	@PikFan	how so? sorry, I've never played Minecraft long enough to do that...
2016-08-17 00:15:44	Scruffy	Once you can build a bed in Minecraft, you can sleep to completely skip the night
2016-08-17 00:15:50	Scruffy	But you can only sleep at night
2016-08-17 00:15:58	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-17 00:16:10	@PikFan	well, let's change that
2016-08-17 00:16:47	@PikFan	it should be like... sleep till dawn, midday, evening, or night
2016-08-17 00:17:00	Scruffy	yeah

2016-08-17 00:19:40	Scruffy	Heh, yeah
2016-08-17 00:19:59	@PikFan	...I wonder how he'd do in the discord
2016-08-17 00:20:14	@PikFan	I wonder if he'd even be interested in joining the discord
2016-08-17 00:20:34	@PikFan	well, next time he hops on, I'll ask
2016-08-17 00:20:54	Scruffy	Alright
2016-08-17 00:21:09	@PikFan	okay
2016-08-17 00:21:21	@PikFan	hmm
2016-08-17 00:21:36	@PikFan	Luther said that making bases is cringy
2016-08-17 00:21:39	@PikFan	but how so?
2016-08-17 00:21:51	@PikFan	creating a base wouldn't necessarily have to be time consuming
2016-08-17 00:22:01	@PikFan	you could expand on it, sure
2016-08-17 00:22:01	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-17 00:22:20	@PikFan	but to START a base wouldn't have to be time consuming
2016-08-17 00:22:36	@PikFan	just find a place with few or no enemies, and you're golden
2016-08-17 00:22:37	Scruffy	All you really need in Pikmin-world is space to call a landing site for your spaceship and Onion
2016-08-17 00:22:43	@PikFan	yep
2016-08-17 00:23:07	@PikFan	moreso Onion than spaceship, but yeah
2016-08-17 00:23:16	Scruffy	Would you even have a spaceship?
2016-08-17 00:23:22	@PikFan	probably
2016-08-17 00:23:37	@PikFan	at some point
2016-08-17 00:23:47	@PikFan	it'd allow for instantaneous travel between bases
2016-08-17 00:24:06	Scruffy	And it would collect resources that aren't Pikmin stock
2016-08-17 00:24:13	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-17 00:24:35	Scruffy	So you can only have one active base at a time then?
2016-08-17 00:24:39	@PikFan	this brings up another problem with the 100 Pikmin limit, but I already found a solution
2016-08-17 00:25:02	@PikFan	the game would prompt you to collect all idle/buried/busy Pikmin
2016-08-17 00:25:08	@PikFan	and yes, I imagine so
2016-08-17 00:25:15	@PikFan	only one base with a ship, anyway :P
2016-08-17 00:25:46	@PikFan	...oh
2016-08-17 00:26:17	@PikFan	perhaps you could collect an upgrade (or make it, even) that's essentially a super-whistle
2016-08-17 00:26:34	Scruffy	Calls all Pikmin to you?
2016-08-17 00:26:40	@PikFan	yep
2016-08-17 00:26:46	Scruffy	Assuming they follow paths to get to you?
2016-08-17 00:26:47	@PikFan	all the Pikmin in your region, anyway
2016-08-17 00:26:55	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-17 00:27:00	@PikFan	it would work
2016-08-17 00:27:06	@PikFan	they could just follow carrying paths :P
2016-08-17 00:27:19	Scruffy	You shouldn't be able to use that all the time
2016-08-17 00:27:24	@PikFan	I agree
2016-08-17 00:27:32	@PikFan	I was thinking it'd have some kind of cooldown
2016-08-17 00:27:59	@PikFan	like maybe you can only use it once or twice a day
2016-08-17 00:28:04	@PikFan	but even twice a day is pushing it
2016-08-17 00:29:04	Scruffy	I thought it could be an upgrade to your ship that you can use once per day
2016-08-17 00:29:17	@PikFan	ah, yes
2016-08-17 00:29:20	@PikFan	that would work
2016-08-17 00:29:34	@PikFan	otherwise, you'd have to collect them yourself
2016-08-17 00:29:46	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-17 00:29:52	@PikFan	I had a new idea
2016-08-17 00:30:09	@PikFan	and this really goes along with metal collection in PF, but there wouldn't be as much emphasis on it
2016-08-17 00:30:22	Scruffy	mhm/
2016-08-17 00:30:23	Scruffy	?
2016-08-17 00:30:38	@PikFan	would you need to collect a power source for your ship?
2016-08-17 00:30:46	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-08-17 00:31:02	@PikFan	...I feel like it would just be another thing players would have to do
2016-08-17 00:31:09	@PikFan	eh, never mind
2016-08-17 00:31:33	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:31:48	Scruffy	Also, one thing we should address above all else
2016-08-17 00:31:53	Scruffy	Why do you need to explore?
2016-08-17 00:32:05	Scruffy	What are you doing there
2016-08-17 00:32:06	@PikFan	for the fun of it! :P
2016-08-17 00:32:12	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-17 00:32:19	@PikFan	but yeah
2016-08-17 00:32:33	@PikFan	we never did make any solid ground on the ulterior motive
2016-08-17 00:32:39	Scruffy	That's actually No Man's Sky in a nutshell
2016-08-17 00:33:01	Scruffy	At the beginning you can spurn a goal and just explore
2016-08-17 00:33:06	@PikFan	yeah, doesn't it just plop you down on some random planet and tell you to explore?
2016-08-17 00:33:10	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-17 00:33:24	Scruffy	But optionally you can begin a quest to get to the center of the galaxy
2016-08-17 00:33:24	@PikFan	ah
2016-08-17 00:33:30	@PikFan	ooh
2016-08-17 00:33:49	Scruffy	If you decline, you just explore, even though the captions you think to yourself still make it seem like you're on some quest
2016-08-17 00:34:49	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-17 00:35:04	Scruffy	Anyway, before we discuss any ulterior motives we should think up the main one
2016-08-17 00:35:12	Scruffy	For example, Louie could still be missing
2016-08-17 00:35:13	@PikFan	right
2016-08-17 00:35:32	@PikFan	so that would be the highest priority mission
2016-08-17 00:36:00	@PikFan	poor Louie, all he is is just a game mechanic at this point :P
2016-08-17 00:36:34	Scruffy	yeah heh
2016-08-17 00:37:45	Scruffy	Okay so Louie could be missing
2016-08-17 00:38:09	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-17 00:38:11	Scruffy	Then why would you need to instantly transport back to other places
2016-08-17 00:38:29	@PikFan	oh, that would be a convenience 
2016-08-17 00:38:33	@PikFan	you don't HAVE to
2016-08-17 00:38:38	@PikFan	it's just there if you want to
2016-08-17 00:38:48	Scruffy	Right, but what's the point of returning to where you've been
2016-08-17 00:39:01	@PikFan	missions
2016-08-17 00:39:07	Scruffy	I suppose there would be challenges only certain Pikmin could complete
2016-08-17 00:39:15	@PikFan	the colony would assign various missions
2016-08-17 00:39:37	@PikFan	and I imagine some of these missions would entail you going back to places you've already been in
2016-08-17 00:39:51	@PikFan	or, at least, traveling through them
2016-08-17 00:39:54	Scruffy	Ah, I see
2016-08-17 00:40:01	Scruffy	WOAH HAD AN IDEA
2016-08-17 00:40:10	@PikFan	oh?
2016-08-17 00:40:11	Scruffy	So P2 and P3 have had areas representing seasons
2016-08-17 00:40:20	@PikFan	you don't mean...?!
2016-08-17 00:40:25	Scruffy	What if, in this game, the seasons actually moved between areas!
2016-08-17 00:40:33	@PikFan	!
2016-08-17 00:40:44	@PikFan	that'd be pretty fantastic!
2016-08-17 00:40:47	Scruffy	So every area would rotate between spring summer autumn and winter
2016-08-17 00:41:01	Scruffy	the only problem would be, it'd be difficult to convey that smoothly
2016-08-17 00:41:01	@PikFan	heh, area...
2016-08-17 00:41:04	@PikFan	right
2016-08-17 00:41:11	Scruffy	It'd be easier if they were separate spaces
2016-08-17 00:41:17	@PikFan	true
2016-08-17 00:41:35	@PikFan	but it could be like
2016-08-17 00:41:49	@PikFan	as you move from one region to the next, the weather and temperature gradually change
2016-08-17 00:42:22	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:42:39	Scruffy	Oh that'd be neat, if a rainstorm passed through the world and you could follow it
2016-08-17 00:42:46	@PikFan	ooh
2016-08-17 00:42:57	Scruffy	That'd mean you'd need a weather map, perhaps as an upgrade
2016-08-17 00:43:06	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-08-17 00:43:10	Scruffy	Yeah, perhaps instead of rotating seasons, we could rotate weather
2016-08-17 00:43:15	Scruffy	snow, rain, drought
2016-08-17 00:43:17	@PikFan	that's better
2016-08-17 00:43:20	Scruffy	things like that
2016-08-17 00:43:37	Scruffy	So the areas could be a bit more like Pikmin 1 areas, a bit less seasonal
2016-08-17 00:43:38	@PikFan	because I was going to ask, "how do we explain having 4 seasons in one little section of the planet?"
2016-08-17 00:43:43	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-17 00:44:05	@PikFan	but yeah, that's a more rational decision
2016-08-17 00:44:42	@PikFan	oh, we need to think about what kinds of areas there will be
2016-08-17 00:44:49	Scruffy	hmmm
2016-08-17 00:44:54	@PikFan	and also, will there be underground areas?
2016-08-17 00:45:00	Scruffy	Oooh
2016-08-17 00:45:05	@PikFan	I imagine caves would be like the ones in P3
2016-08-17 00:45:09	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:45:13	@PikFan	P2 style caves would not work at all
2016-08-17 00:45:18	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-17 00:45:29	@PikFan	but even then, caves might be rare
2016-08-17 00:45:37	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:45:50	Scruffy	But that's not to say one place couldn't be like the Forest Navel
2016-08-17 00:46:21	@PikFan	that's true
2016-08-17 00:46:38	Scruffy	Heh, there's a reason to return somewhere
2016-08-17 00:46:47	@PikFan	the nostalgia? :P
2016-08-17 00:47:13	Scruffy	Oh, I was thinking it could be an arid sort of overworld, and then you return with the means to dig a tunnel to a completely new underground area
2016-08-17 00:47:42	@PikFan	ah
2016-08-17 00:48:05	@PikFan	oh, I have a practical reason why you'd want to return to earlier areas
2016-08-17 00:48:29	@PikFan	because you gain more Pikmin types, so in these earlier areas, you can get to new places in those areas
2016-08-17 00:48:45	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-08-17 00:48:46	@PikFan	that's how it's been in the canon games
2016-08-17 00:48:50	Scruffy	yep
2016-08-17 00:49:06	Scruffy	yeah, water is the biggest one
2016-08-17 00:49:13	Scruffy	the biggest obstacle to overcome
2016-08-17 00:49:18	@PikFan	yep
2016-08-17 00:49:31	@PikFan	so maybe Blue Pikmin would be one of the last ones to be found
2016-08-17 00:49:40	@PikFan	they ARE the last Pikmin type found in each game
2016-08-17 00:49:48	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:49:54	Scruffy	Except PF :P
2016-08-17 00:49:55	@PikFan	...that is, if you don't do the Blue Pikmin early glitch in Pikmin 2
2016-08-17 00:49:58	 *	@PikFan snickers
2016-08-17 00:50:05	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-08-17 00:50:36	@PikFan	aren't Blue Pikmin one of the last found, though?
2016-08-17 00:50:49	Scruffy	They're the third last
2016-08-17 00:51:05	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-08-17 00:51:09	Scruffy	Then Lichen Pikmin, then Winged
2016-08-17 00:52:47	Scruffy	But yeah, it's satisfying to finally get Blue Pikmin
2016-08-17 00:52:55	@PikFan	I agree
2016-08-17 00:53:26	@PikFan	oh, apparently there's a challenge run in Pikmin 3 where you use only the 3 original types of Pikmin
2016-08-17 00:53:37	@PikFan	and you use Rocks/Wingeds for mandatory purposes
2016-08-17 00:53:44	Scruffy	Hmm
2016-08-17 00:53:45	@PikFan	*for only
2016-08-17 00:53:54	Scruffy	That's a neat one
2016-08-17 00:54:12	Scruffy	I still need to enact my challenge run of trying to grow as many Pikmin as possible in 99 days and finish
2016-08-17 00:54:31	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-17 00:55:02	@PikFan	I remember I had a hard time defeating all enemies in the Distant Tundra
2016-08-17 00:55:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:55:11	@PikFan	(wow, almost wrote Rugged Tundra)
2016-08-17 00:55:15	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-08-17 00:55:31	@PikFan	I blame the Spotty Bulbear
2016-08-17 00:55:36	Scruffy	I'm almost finished with that music
2016-08-17 00:55:44	@PikFan	oooh
2016-08-17 00:55:56	Scruffy	The spotty bulbear?
2016-08-17 00:56:13	Scruffy	Oh, it kept you from beating all enemies/
2016-08-17 00:56:15	@PikFan	yeah, the Spotty Bulbear in the DT always gave me a hard time
2016-08-17 00:56:20	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:56:21	@PikFan	when I tried to kill it
2016-08-17 00:56:29	Scruffy	There's that cove with the 10 bomb rocks though
2016-08-17 00:56:34	@PikFan	and also, collecting it is a /pain/
2016-08-17 00:56:38	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 00:57:14	@PikFan	because I have 10 Wingeds holding the gate up, as well as at least 20 Reds carrying the Bulbear + the dwarves
2016-08-17 00:57:25	Scruffy	Ah yeah
2016-08-17 00:58:39	@PikFan	but anyway, about the music
2016-08-17 00:58:47	@PikFan	it's just the base theme you're working on, right?
2016-08-17 00:58:58	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-17 00:59:01	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-08-17 00:59:12	Scruffy	I could add mixes though, if you wish
2016-08-17 00:59:22	Scruffy	Or if you'd like to hear the base thing first, that's fine
2016-08-17 00:59:29	@PikFan	the latter, yeah
2016-08-17 00:59:43	Scruffy	Cool
2016-08-17 01:00:11	@PikFan	yay, unintentional puns
2016-08-17 01:00:22	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-17 01:00:28	@PikFan	or... was that intentional?
2016-08-17 01:00:30	@PikFan	:P
2016-08-17 01:00:40	Scruffy	It's always intentional
2016-08-17 01:01:14	Scruffy	Except, you know, when delivering serious news or something
2016-08-17 01:02:57	@PikFan	ah
2016-08-17 01:03:22	@PikFan	well, that was pretty chill
2016-08-17 01:03:33	Scruffy	heh
2016-08-17 01:03:50	Scruffy	Did I ever tell you any ideas about Pikmin Color Splash?
2016-08-17 01:03:54	Scruffy	If you car :O
2016-08-17 01:03:58	Scruffy	care :P*
2016-08-17 01:04:14	@PikFan	I remember you talking about the animations and such
2016-08-17 01:04:31	@PikFan	but I'm guessing your ideas would be an extension of the April Fool's Day joke?
2016-08-17 01:04:49	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-17 01:05:02	Scruffy	A full-fledged plot, mechanics, music, and such
2016-08-17 01:05:15	@PikFan	heheheh
2016-08-17 01:05:23	@PikFan	but would this still be considered a joke?
2016-08-17 01:05:48	Scruffy	Hmm, I don't know
2016-08-17 01:05:58	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-17 01:06:15	@PikFan	joke or not, I believe the final product would be pretty entertaining :P
2016-08-17 01:06:21	Scruffy	Yeah, heh
2016-08-17 01:06:35	Scruffy	But I don't know if I should start that until I've gotten farther in PF or not
2016-08-17 01:07:02	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-08-17 01:07:11	@PikFan	you've still got the areas to do...
2016-08-17 01:07:16	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-17 01:07:34	@PikFan	I'm not worrying about caves though, there's only 1 game on the wiki that actually has a page for all their caves
2016-08-17 01:07:47	@PikFan	speaking of caves
2016-08-17 01:07:56	@PikFan	I still need to name my new caves
2016-08-17 01:08:07	Scruffy	Ooh, maybe I can help!
2016-08-17 01:08:12	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin:_Connection_of_the_Worlds/Sandbox
2016-08-17 01:08:25	@PikFan	so many "To be determined..."s :S
2016-08-17 01:08:37	@PikFan	oh, sure!
2016-08-17 01:08:45	@PikFan	I'd appreciate it
2016-08-17 01:09:19	@PikFan	hmm, let me look at my list of already existing caves, maybe we can use a couple of those
2016-08-17 01:09:28	Scruffy	Well, how many caves are you planning for each area?
2016-08-17 01:09:36	@PikFan	3, at the most
2016-08-17 01:09:51	Scruffy	Ah, okay
2016-08-17 01:09:58	@PikFan	24 caves is a lot
2016-08-17 01:10:03	@PikFan	even for a fangame
2016-08-17 01:10:31	Scruffy	Yeah

2016-08-17 01:11:10	@PikFan	...wow
2016-08-17 01:11:38	@PikFan	I'm only now realizing how uninspired my cave names are
2016-08-17 01:12:05	@PikFan	I really like my new area names though
2016-08-17 01:12:11	Scruffy	I like Bejeweled Chasm and Grainy Realm
2016-08-17 01:12:17	Scruffy	Yeah, the area names are really good
2016-08-17 01:12:30	Scruffy	A question though
2016-08-17 01:12:31	@PikFan	my favorite is Bitterfrost Woods
2016-08-17 01:12:34	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-08-17 01:12:40	Scruffy	Or a comment, rather
2016-08-17 01:12:47	@PikFan	heh, okay
2016-08-17 01:12:57	Scruffy	I don't think Olimar would call the last area "The Moon"
2016-08-17 01:13:09	@PikFan	hehe, yeah
2016-08-17 01:13:20	@PikFan	but you need not worry, since I'm getting rid of it anyway
2016-08-17 01:13:21	Scruffy	I mean it is the only moon there, but maybe "Mysterious Moon" or something
2016-08-17 01:13:25	Scruffy	Oh
2016-08-17 01:13:59	@PikFan	"The Portal" is also extremely uninspired
2016-08-17 01:14:09	@PikFan	and tbh I just stole the whole idea from another user
2016-08-17 01:14:12	Scruffy	I like its simplicity in contrast to the others though
2016-08-17 01:14:14	Scruffy	oh
2016-08-17 01:14:19	Scruffy	hang on, brb
2016-08-17 01:14:22	@PikFan	oh, oaky

2016-08-17 01:20:34	@PikFan	back
2016-08-17 01:23:31	@PikFan	okay, let's start with the caves for the Ancient Valley
2016-08-17 01:23:50	@PikFan	I like nouns, but not so much the adjectives
2016-08-17 01:24:08	@PikFan	Fissure and Tunnels are good
2016-08-17 01:24:22	@PikFan	now, we just need to come up with some good adjectives for them

2016-08-17 01:27:53	@PikFan	heh, everything okay?
2016-08-17 01:27:57	Scruffy	Yeah, sorry
2016-08-17 01:28:17	Scruffy	It just disconnected when I woke my computer up
2016-08-17 01:28:27	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-17 01:28:29	Scruffy	You wanted to start with the cave naming?
2016-08-17 01:28:47	@PikFan	17:23:33	PikFan	okay, let's start with the caves for the Ancient Valley
2016-08-17 01:28:56	@PikFan	17:23:52	PikFan	I like nouns, but not so much the adjectives
2016-08-17 01:29:06	@PikFan	17:24:11	PikFan	Fissure and Tunnels are good

2016-08-17 01:29:18	Scruffy	hmmm
2016-08-17 01:29:27	Scruffy	So rather than fissure
2016-08-17 01:29:38	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-08-17 01:29:38	Scruffy	What do you want there to be in the cave?
2016-08-17 01:29:46	Scruffy	Sorry, not rather
2016-08-17 01:29:53	Scruffy	I mean rather than rocky
2016-08-17 01:30:10	@PikFan	oh, gotcha
2016-08-17 01:30:23	@PikFan	well, I mean, rocky feels bland
2016-08-17 01:30:31	@PikFan	hmm
2016-08-17 01:30:33	@PikFan	actually
2016-08-17 01:30:43	@PikFan	fissure implies narrowness, right?
2016-08-17 01:30:48	Scruffy	Yes
2016-08-17 01:30:54	@PikFan	okay
2016-08-17 01:31:01	@PikFan	I'm not sure how a narrow cave would work
2016-08-17 01:31:42	@PikFan	I don't think players would be fond of a cave whose sublevels are straight lines
2016-08-17 01:32:00	Scruffy	True
2016-08-17 01:32:09	@PikFan	perhaps... crag?
2016-08-17 01:32:15	@PikFan	wait
2016-08-17 01:32:17	Scruffy	Fault is another good f word for hole in the ground
2016-08-17 01:32:29	Scruffy	hang on, I have to show my brother the new video
2016-08-17 01:32:29	@PikFan	oh, no, crag won't work
2016-08-17 01:32:37	@PikFan	ooh, yes
2016-08-17 01:32:42	@PikFan	Frozen Fault

2016-08-17 01:32:52	Scruffy	I'll be back in 15 minutes
2016-08-17 01:33:05	@PikFan	hehe, alright
2016-08-17 01:37:08	@PikFan	rift and cavity could be good nouns
2016-08-17 02:01:37	@PikFan	hey, you back?
2016-08-17 02:06:06	Scruffy	Back
2016-08-17 02:06:13	Scruffy	Sorry about the wait

2016-08-17 02:08:35	@PikFan	wait, you have MK8, right?
2016-08-17 02:08:38	Scruffy	Yes

2016-08-17 02:09:46	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-08-17 02:09:49	Scruffy	I'm not sure about that though
2016-08-17 02:10:19	Scruffy	So you're telling me I fire up MK8, and there's a search function within it to find you?
2016-08-17 02:11:35	@PikFan	press the home button and go to friend list
2016-08-17 02:12:28	Scruffy	Ok

2016-08-17 05:03:29	@PikFan	I can't wait to hear it!
2016-08-17 05:03:32	Scruffy	Yeah!
2016-08-17 05:03:38	Scruffy	I can dropbox it to you real quick
2016-08-17 05:03:50	Scruffy	I'll send you the link in just a sec
2016-08-17 05:03:53	@PikFan	okay
2016-08-17 05:03:56	@PikFan	awesome!
2016-08-17 05:05:32	Scruffy	https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wm41zkppxc8jum/Rugged%20Tundra.mp3?dl=0
2016-08-17 05:05:37	Scruffy	Let me know if that works
2016-08-17 05:07:44	Scruffy	It's meant to loop, so sorry if the end is a little abrupt
2016-08-17 05:07:54	@PikFan	oh, heh
2016-08-17 05:08:02	@PikFan	I'm just listening to it a few times first...
2016-08-17 05:10:43	@PikFan	well
2016-08-17 05:10:55	@PikFan	the first time I heard it, I envisioned myself in a giant crystalline cave
2016-08-17 05:11:07	@PikFan	with like snow gently falling down
2016-08-17 05:11:14	@PikFan	like... a waterfall of snow
2016-08-17 05:11:17	@PikFan	a snowfall, I guess
2016-08-17 05:11:33	@PikFan	the first part was definitely made me feel like I was in a huge room
2016-08-17 05:11:51	Scruffy	oooh
2016-08-17 05:12:25	@PikFan	around 0:32 things started sounding precarious
2016-08-17 05:12:39	@PikFan	I like the instrument that goes up and down
2016-08-17 05:12:44	@PikFan	uh... what do you call that?
2016-08-17 05:13:16	@PikFan	but yes, definitely feels treacherous
2016-08-17 05:13:45	@PikFan	I can imagine you braving the winds as you walk up the river's shore and that exact moment starts playing
2016-08-17 05:13:52	Scruffy	Heh
2016-08-17 05:14:02	Scruffy	I'm not sure which instrument you're referring to
2016-08-17 05:14:25	@PikFan	well, its volume goes up steadily, then down steadily
2016-08-17 05:14:35	Scruffy	Oh that
2016-08-17 05:14:47	Scruffy	Violins and violas
2016-08-17 05:14:53	@PikFan	OH
2016-08-17 05:14:55	@PikFan	okay
2016-08-17 05:14:58	Scruffy	There in a crescendo and decrescendo
2016-08-17 05:15:13	Scruffy	crescendo looks like <
2016-08-17 05:15:18	Scruffy	decrescendo looks like >
2016-08-17 05:15:43	Scruffy	So when you have them together like this "< >," some call it a dovetail effect
2016-08-17 05:16:01	Scruffy	that rising and falling of volume
2016-08-17 05:17:01	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-08-17 05:17:50	@PikFan	I'd suggest making a slightly calmer theme for the landing site, possibly
2016-08-17 05:18:06	@PikFan	so it doesn't sound as treacherous to begin with
2016-08-17 05:18:20	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 05:18:37	@PikFan	but not so calm to the point where it sounds like a sunset theme
2016-08-17 05:18:44	Scruffy	That shouldn't be too difficult
2016-08-17 05:18:47	@PikFan	you get what I'm saying, yeah?
2016-08-17 05:18:50	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 05:18:56	@PikFan	heh, okay
2016-08-17 05:19:19	@PikFan	that reminds me, they used the Valley of Repose's sunset theme at first
2016-08-17 05:19:31	@PikFan	and then when you reunited the leaders, the main theme played
2016-08-17 05:19:38	Scruffy	But is this version okay? Any big changes you were thinking to it?
2016-08-17 05:19:46	Scruffy	Oh, yeah, it's really cool that way
2016-08-17 05:20:20	Scruffy	The sunset theme that plays while you're learning about Onions and Pikmin is a separate file from the Valley of Repose
2016-08-17 05:20:31	Scruffy	Valley of Repose sunset theme file*
2016-08-17 05:24:15	@PikFan	oh wow
2016-08-17 05:24:18	@PikFan	that's neat
2016-08-17 05:26:24	@PikFan	but yes, I love how this turned out
2016-08-17 05:26:33	Scruffy	Yay!
2016-08-17 05:26:36	Scruffy	Glad to hear it
2016-08-17 05:26:44	@PikFan	haha
2016-08-17 05:26:58	Scruffy	I can get started on some variations then
2016-08-17 05:27:02	Scruffy	What would you like?
2016-08-17 05:27:12	@PikFan	post this on the discord, I'm sure they'd like to hear one of your audio creations
2016-08-17 05:27:33	@PikFan	well, I'd like the landing site variation first :P
2016-08-17 05:27:39	@PikFan	then maybe an enemy mix
2016-08-17 05:27:49	Scruffy	Right
2016-08-17 05:27:50	@PikFan	how hard is it to make variations?
2016-08-17 05:28:22	Scruffy	Not as hard as the original composition
2016-08-17 05:28:29	Scruffy	So it shouldn't take as long
2016-08-17 05:28:32	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-08-17 05:28:52	Scruffy	I'll put this on discord
2016-08-17 05:33:28	@PikFan	such a positive reception
2016-08-17 05:38:08	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-17 05:40:44	Scruffy	I'm starting work on a new Pikmin 3 funk arrangement :P
2016-08-17 05:40:52	Scruffy	as well
2016-08-17 05:41:38	@PikFan	Luther said "that sounds sexy"
2016-08-17 05:41:39	@PikFan	:P
2016-08-17 06:03:41	@PikFan	"i must get my point across"
2016-08-17 06:03:43	@PikFan	oh dear
2016-08-17 06:03:55	 *	@PikFan hides
2016-08-17 06:23:13	Scruffy	hehe
2016-08-17 06:32:20	@PikFan	and now you get to hear my voice
2016-08-17 06:32:29	@PikFan	hope it's not too bad :P
2016-08-17 06:50:05	Scruffy	No no, not at all

2016-08-17 13:28:57	@PikFan	hey RoboIan!
2016-08-17 13:29:05	Yoshi2	hiho RoboIan 
2016-08-17 13:29:26	RoboIan	Hi, PikFan! Hey, Yoshi2!
2016-08-17 13:29:49	@PikFan	So, I hear you're having issues with your sig
2016-08-17 13:30:08	RoboIan	Yeah, I don't even want a dumb sig anyway.
2016-08-17 13:30:14	@PikFan	Lol
2016-08-17 13:30:23	RoboIan	I mean, I am not a good programmer.
2016-08-17 13:30:33	RoboIan	It's hard for me.
2016-08-17 13:30:34	@PikFan	Lol, you don't need to know how to program
2016-08-17 13:30:47	RoboIan	I am only a 9 year old boy.
2016-08-17 13:31:03	RoboIan	Don't get me wrong, I should be experienced.
2016-08-17 13:31:06	@PikFan	Heh, you can't be THAT young
2016-08-17 13:31:19	RoboIan	Actually, I am that young.
2016-08-17 13:31:30	@PikFan	I'd expect like a 12 year old to be able to make your game page, but a 9 year old? You're a prodigy :P
2016-08-17 13:31:48	RoboIan	I know right?
2016-08-17 13:32:01	Yoshi2	you write very well
2016-08-17 13:32:07	RoboIan	I added some links every here and there in my game page yesterday.
2016-08-17 13:32:10	@PikFan	I saw
2016-08-17 13:32:30	@PikFan	But anyway, let's talk about your sig
2016-08-17 13:32:35	RoboIan	Ok.
2016-08-17 13:32:39	@PikFan	So, did you mess around with your preferences?
2016-08-17 13:32:51	RoboIan	What preferences?
2016-08-17 13:33:03	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Special:Preferences
2016-08-17 13:33:07	@PikFan	That ^
2016-08-17 13:33:14	RoboIan	I didn't mess with anythi-
2016-08-17 13:33:23	RoboIan	Ok, lemme check.
2016-08-17 13:34:35	RoboIan	Ok, I found something that has to do with my sig.
2016-08-17 13:34:59	RoboIan	It seems to be ON.
2016-08-17 13:35:39	@PikFan	Okay, there should be two fields
2016-08-17 13:35:55	@PikFan	One of them is "Existing signature" and the other is "New signature"
2016-08-17 13:36:07	@PikFan	What do they display as, for you?
2016-08-17 13:36:19	RoboIan	Just my username.
2016-08-17 13:36:33	@PikFan	Hmmm.......
2016-08-17 13:36:52	@PikFan	How weird, cause typing out ~~~~ should give you your signature
2016-08-17 13:36:54	RoboIan	It's like typing school here!
2016-08-17 13:36:59	@PikFan	Haha
2016-08-17 13:37:24	RoboIan	Oh, I didn't make a sit, btw.
2016-08-17 13:37:30	@PikFan	When you type it out, you make sure not to use the <nowiki> tags, right?
2016-08-17 13:37:32	RoboIan	Sig*
2016-08-17 13:37:52	RoboIan	Uh, I actually did...
2016-08-17 13:37:58	@PikFan	Oh, then that's why
2016-08-17 13:38:28	@PikFan	Yeah, if you type out ~~~~ WITHOUT using <nowiki> before and after it, it will make your sig
2016-08-17 13:38:47	@PikFan	Those tags forces them to display as normal text, as you found out :P
2016-08-17 13:38:53	RoboIan	So, I just have to not use <no wiki>?
2016-08-17 13:38:57	@PikFan	Yep
2016-08-17 13:39:09	RoboIan	Great, it autocorrected me.
2016-08-17 13:39:13	@PikFan	Lol
2016-08-17 13:39:21	RoboIan	That always happens to me.
2016-08-17 13:39:30	@PikFan	Yeah, autocorrect is annoying
2016-08-17 13:39:46	RoboIan	Where's Yoshi2?
2016-08-17 13:39:50	@PikFan	Idling
2016-08-17 13:39:52	Yoshi2	i am here
2016-08-17 13:40:32	RoboIan	Sorry, Yoshi2, you were just off for a while.
2016-08-17 13:41:01	Yoshi2	I was online all the time
2016-08-17 13:41:05	@PikFan	One of the things that you should know about chat is that some people 
2016-08-17 13:41:07	@PikFan	Heh
2016-08-17 13:41:10	@PikFan	wait what lol
2016-08-17 13:41:10	RoboIan	Oh.
2016-08-17 13:41:19	Yoshi2	mibbit just shows me as idle because I didn't write anything in over 10 minutes or so
2016-08-17 13:41:25	@PikFan	Yes
2016-08-17 13:41:57	@PikFan	What I meant to say was "One of the things that you should know about chat is that some people won't respond right away when you first get on"
2016-08-17 13:41:59	RoboIan	So, I guess I should use my sig.
2016-08-17 13:42:04	@PikFan	Yep
2016-08-17 13:42:23	@PikFan	It makes it easier for the rest of us to know who wrote what
2016-08-17 13:42:26	RoboIan	Ok. Cya!

2016-08-17 13:47:14	RoboIan	Ok. I would like it to have-
2016-08-17 13:47:16	@PikFan	First, what would you like the image to be?

2016-08-17 13:47:31	RoboIan	That was exactly what I was about to say...
2016-08-17 13:47:36	@PikFan	XD
2016-08-17 13:48:18	RoboIan	I would like it to have a Blue Winged Pikmin. Read my story at my userpage for info about that.
2016-08-17 13:48:31	@PikFan	Hmm... a Blue Winged Pikmin?
2016-08-17 13:48:53	RoboIan	Yes, it sounds weird, but I chose it due to my story.
2016-08-17 13:49:02	@PikFan	I don't have an image for that, but I can ask a friend of mine to make it for you
2016-08-17 13:49:07	RoboIan	Ok.
2016-08-17 13:49:24	RoboIan	You can always just draw one from an art app.
2016-08-17 13:49:25	@PikFan	Okay, then what?
2016-08-17 13:49:37	@PikFan	Heh, yeah
2016-08-17 13:49:55	@PikFan	My friend has GIMP, I'll just ask her to recolor a picture of a Winged Pikmin
2016-08-17 13:50:14	RoboIan	Cool.
2016-08-17 13:50:21	RoboIan	My mom has GIMP.

2016-08-17 13:51:08	@PikFan	What else do you want for your friend box?
2016-08-17 13:51:28	RoboIan	Uh...

2016-08-17 13:51:47	@PikFan	Heh
2016-08-17 13:52:17	RoboIan	Well, I want the box background to be Cyan.
2016-08-17 13:52:24	@PikFan	Sure thing
2016-08-17 13:52:37	@PikFan	How about the text color?
2016-08-17 13:52:40	RoboIan	Btw, you can tell that my favorite color is blue.
2016-08-17 13:52:49	RoboIan	Uh, do a simple black.
2016-08-17 13:52:55	@PikFan	You got it
2016-08-17 13:53:07	@PikFan	What would you like the text to say?
2016-08-17 13:53:41	RoboIan	"This user is a friend of RoboIan!"
2016-08-17 13:53:49	@PikFan	Alrighty
2016-08-17 13:53:51	RoboIan	Yeah, just simple like that.
2016-08-17 13:53:57	RoboIan	I like simple
2016-08-17 13:54:14	@PikFan	And finally, what color would you like the border to be? Just black, I'm guessing?
2016-08-17 13:54:29	RoboIan	What do you mean by border?
2016-08-17 13:54:55	@PikFan	Well
2016-08-17 13:54:57	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Template:Cheepy-CheepyFriend
2016-08-17 13:55:18	@PikFan	For example, if you look around the picture of the Boo, you'll see a black line around it
2016-08-17 13:55:21	@PikFan	That's the border
2016-08-17 13:55:25	RoboIan	Oh, you mean the outline.
2016-08-17 13:55:33	RoboIan	Ok ok.
2016-08-17 13:55:34	@PikFan	Same difference :P
2016-08-17 13:55:54	RoboIan	I want it Cyan, so it blends in with my Userbox background.
2016-08-17 13:56:05	@PikFan	Okay
2016-08-17 13:56:59	@PikFan	Okay, so to sum it all up: Blue Winged Pikmin picture, cyan background, black text that says "This user is a friend of RoboIan!" and a cyan outline
2016-08-17 13:57:17	RoboIan	Yes, that is accurate.
2016-08-17 13:57:37	@PikFan	Alrighty then! I'll create it as soon as my friend makes the picture
2016-08-17 13:57:47	RoboIan	Sweet!
2016-08-17 13:57:59	@PikFan	Yep
2016-08-17 13:58:02	RoboIan	That shouldn't take long for your friend to make it.
2016-08-17 13:58:07	@PikFan	I know
2016-08-17 13:58:20	@PikFan	I just have to wait for her to come online first
2016-08-17 13:58:39	RoboIan	Also, is the flower on the Pikmin going to be blue or pink
2016-08-17 13:58:53	@PikFan	Oh, good point
2016-08-17 13:59:01	@PikFan	Which do you want it to be?
2016-08-17 13:59:13	RoboIan	I would say Blue.
2016-08-17 13:59:22	@PikFan	Heh, okay
2016-08-17 13:59:32	@PikFan	Hmm...and the eyes?
2016-08-17 13:59:56	RoboIan	Like a basic Winged Pikmin.
2016-08-17 14:00:03	RoboIan	Keep it default.
2016-08-17 14:00:50	RoboIan	Uh, are you on?
2016-08-17 14:01:19	@PikFan	Yes
2016-08-17 14:01:27	@PikFan	Sorry, distracted for a moment
2016-08-17 14:01:36	RoboIan	Distracted by what?
2016-08-17 14:01:51	@PikFan	Just another chatroom I'm in
2016-08-17 14:01:57	RoboIan	Ok.
2016-08-17 14:02:07	@PikFan	But okay, yeah, that's fine
2016-08-17 14:02:08	RoboIan	I get distracted by my TV a lot.
2016-08-17 14:02:13	@PikFan	Hehe
2016-08-17 14:02:58	@PikFan	But yes, I'll be glad to make your friend box
2016-08-17 14:03:27	RoboIan	Anyways, default eyes.
2016-08-17 14:03:39	@PikFan	Right
2016-08-17 14:03:52	RoboIan	Wait.
2016-08-17 14:04:04	RoboIan	Why am I telling you to do stuff when your an admin?
2016-08-17 14:05:26	@PikFan	You tell me :P
2016-08-17 14:05:36	@PikFan	I'm just a slave to the wiki
2016-08-17 14:05:42	@PikFan	Just kidding :P
2016-08-17 14:05:48	Yoshi2	admins don't have to be dictators
2016-08-17 14:06:06	RoboIan	🤓
2016-08-17 14:06:17	RoboIan	That's like me in real life.
2016-08-17 14:06:38	RoboIan	Or, a mesh of me and my autistic brother.
2016-08-17 14:07:29	RoboIan	🤔
2016-08-17 14:07:48	RoboIan	😴💤💤💤💤
2016-08-17 14:08:07	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-17 14:08:39	RoboIan	🎢 I have never been on a Rollercoaster btw.
2016-08-17 14:09:00	@PikFan	It's been ages since I was on a rollercoaster
2016-08-17 14:09:31	RoboIan	Soon, I am going to Disneyworld.
2016-08-17 14:09:38	@PikFan	Nice!
2016-08-17 14:09:52	RoboIan	That, however, is like 2 months later.

2016-08-17 14:09:59	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-17 14:10:28	RoboIan	It will be a long trip over there.
2016-08-17 14:10:33	@PikFan	Mhm
2016-08-17 14:10:45	@PikFan	Well, what state do you live in?
2016-08-17 14:10:49	RoboIan	I live in Texas, and Disneyworld is over in Florida.
2016-08-17 14:10:55	@PikFan	Oh yeah
2016-08-17 14:11:02	@PikFan	That will be a long trip
2016-08-17 14:11:06	@PikFan	Are you going by car?
2016-08-17 14:11:30	RoboIan	That's about 36 hours of driving, and yes, I am going by car.
2016-08-17 14:11:49	@PikFan	Wow!
2016-08-17 14:12:08	RoboIan	Going by plane would cost more money.
2016-08-17 14:12:28	@PikFan	Right, right
2016-08-17 14:12:34	RoboIan	Going by spaceship is pretty much impossible.
2016-08-17 14:12:38	@PikFan	XD
2016-08-17 14:13:13	RoboIan	Going by portal, well, portals don't even exist.
2016-08-17 14:13:34	RoboIan	So, the car it is.
2016-08-17 14:13:54	RoboIan	Oh, hi Yoshi2.
2016-08-17 14:14:28	@PikFan	Hmm... you sure it's a 36 hour drive? Seems like it'd be maybe a 25 hour drive
2016-08-17 14:14:31	Yoshi2	hi, but you greeted me already
2016-08-17 14:15:12	RoboIan	Actually, I am not sure it is 36, that is just a hypothesis.
2016-08-17 14:15:44	RoboIan	But, it is past 24 hours AKA one day.
2016-08-17 14:17:01	RoboIan	That's why we will spend a night at a hotel, somewhere in Missisipi maybe.
2016-08-17 14:17:10	@PikFan	Mhm
2016-08-17 14:17:33	@PikFan	Well, I recently went on a trip to Utah
2016-08-17 14:17:39	@PikFan	And I live in Oregon
2016-08-17 14:17:43	RoboIan	This is going to be a 6 state drive, I think, I am not very good at math.
2016-08-17 14:17:49	@PikFan	When we came back, I was in the car for 13 hours
2016-08-17 14:17:53	RoboIan	Wow.
2016-08-17 14:17:57	@PikFan	Yep
2016-08-17 14:18:01	<--	Miles (Miles@8.10.tzs.mrl) has quit (*.net *.split)
2016-08-17 14:18:08	@PikFan	But honestly, it went by a lot faster than I thought
2016-08-17 14:18:10	RoboIan	You must be a very great explorer.
2016-08-17 14:18:51	@PikFan	Mainly because I was talking with my mom most of the way
2016-08-17 14:18:54	RoboIan	I went to a nearby hotel in, well, I forgot already.
2016-08-17 14:18:59	@PikFan	Heh
2016-08-17 14:19:09	RoboIan	That was quite a few years ago, though.
2016-08-17 14:19:19	@PikFan	But yeah, if you talk a lot with your family members, I'm sure the drive will go by pretty quickly
2016-08-17 14:20:03	RoboIan	Usually I play on my IPad, what I am using right now, or listen to music.
2016-08-17 14:20:21	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-17 14:20:40	RoboIan	When we got to that hotel, it was past, I don't know, dinner time?
2016-08-17 14:20:40	@PikFan	Well, as long as you're distracted
2016-08-17 14:20:58	@PikFan	Heh
2016-08-17 14:21:02	RoboIan	So we went out to a seafood restraint and ate.
2016-08-17 14:21:20	RoboIan	Resturaunt I mean.
2016-08-17 14:21:27	@PikFan	Well, by the time you get to the hotel in Mississippi or wherever, it will most likely be very late at night
2016-08-17 14:21:38	RoboIan	All I had was fries.
2016-08-17 14:21:51	@PikFan	Lol
2016-08-17 14:22:07	RoboIan	Now, I eat an assortment of different foods for dinner.
2016-08-17 14:22:30	RoboIan	But, I do not have anything extra unless I ask for it.
2016-08-17 14:22:59	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-17 14:23:11	RoboIan	Before I just ate Cheese, Bacon, and Crackers every night.
2016-08-17 14:23:26	@PikFan	I am a very picky eater whenever I go to restaurants
2016-08-17 14:23:38	@PikFan	Even though I am 16, I'm very picky
2016-08-17 14:23:40	RoboIan	Now, I eat things like Fishsticks, Quesadias, even Mini Penne.
2016-08-17 14:24:22	RoboIan	However, Mama always gives me something, and makes me eat it.
2016-08-17 14:24:37	RoboIan	So, I am not as picky anymore, either.
2016-08-17 14:24:47	RoboIan	I meant too.
2016-08-17 14:25:23	@PikFan	I see, well that's good
2016-08-17 14:25:24	RoboIan	Is your friend done with the picture for my friend Userbox yet?
2016-08-17 14:25:28	@PikFan	Don't be picky like me :P
2016-08-17 14:25:37	@PikFan	No, my friend is asleep XD
2016-08-17 14:25:47	@PikFan	It'll be a few hours before she wakes up
2016-08-17 14:25:58	RoboIan	Uhg...
2016-08-17 14:27:04	RoboIan	😕
2016-08-17 14:27:19	@PikFan	Sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-08-17 14:28:45	RoboIan	💡
2016-08-17 14:29:06	RoboIan	Nvm..
2016-08-17 14:30:07	RoboIan	I hope she is going to be up at like 9:00 or something.
2016-08-17 14:31:13	@PikFan	I'm not sure

2016-08-17 14:34:09	@PikFan	Oh
2016-08-17 14:34:16	@PikFan	Well, don't worry about it

2016-08-17 14:35:45	RoboIan	Daddy is at work.
2016-08-17 14:35:56	RoboIan	He's a police officer.
2016-08-17 14:36:10	@PikFan	Ooh
2016-08-17 14:36:23	@PikFan	I hope things aren't too hard on him
2016-08-17 14:36:28	RoboIan	He works at Houston.
2016-08-17 14:36:48	@PikFan	Being a cop is tough
2016-08-17 14:37:08	@PikFan	Especially because the news makes them look so bad
2016-08-17 14:37:09	RoboIan	Yeah, but he is a master at it, so things shouldn't be hard.
2016-08-17 14:37:33	RoboIan	And he doesn't usually get interviewed on the news.
2016-08-17 14:37:51	@PikFan	That's not what I meant, but okay :P
2016-08-17 14:37:57	RoboIan	Actually, he has never been interviewed.
2016-08-17 14:38:09	RoboIan	Or, on the news. You know what I mean.
2016-08-17 14:38:28	@PikFan	I know what you mean, but do you know what I mean? :P
2016-08-17 14:38:50	RoboIan	Not really, but still.
2016-08-17 14:39:10	@PikFan	lol
2016-08-17 14:39:53	@PikFan	Do you watch the news at all?
2016-08-17 14:40:07	RoboIan	Only when daddy is home.
2016-08-17 14:40:19	RoboIan	Otherwise, no.
2016-08-17 14:40:23	@PikFan	I see
2016-08-17 14:40:48	@PikFan	Since you're only 9, I'm gonna give you a really important tip:
2016-08-17 14:40:55	@PikFan	Don't trust the news
2016-08-17 14:41:15	RoboIan	Actually, prove yourself wrong.
2016-08-17 14:41:39	@PikFan	Sorry?
2016-08-17 14:41:51	RoboIan	There has been a lot of killers being found in Houston, and the police has to arrest them.
2016-08-17 14:42:11	RoboIan	I believe that, and also I believe it's scary.
2016-08-17 14:42:15	@PikFan	Okay
2016-08-17 14:42:22	Yoshi2	PikFan: not everything is a lie
2016-08-17 14:42:23	@PikFan	You can believe stuff like that
2016-08-17 14:42:44	@PikFan	well yeah Yoshi2, I just don't like the mainstream
2016-08-17 14:42:50	RoboIan	What if a crook broke into our house and shot every one of us in my house?
2016-08-17 14:43:10	@PikFan	That'd be scary
2016-08-17 14:43:14	Yoshi2	some people are so paranoid that they don't trust news at all, but they trust random youtube accounts who don't have any sources
2016-08-17 14:43:31	RoboIan	Really, Yoshi2?
2016-08-17 14:43:33	@PikFan	let me rephrase what I said
2016-08-17 14:43:47	@PikFan	You can trust the news on some things. However...
2016-08-17 14:43:51	RoboIan	"Paraniod"?
2016-08-17 14:44:12	@PikFan	Sometimes, they'll leave little pieces of information out
2016-08-17 14:45:03	RoboIan	Houston will turn into a killer hideout without the police to stop them.
2016-08-17 14:45:20	@PikFan	That's an example of being paranoid
2016-08-17 14:45:37	@PikFan	It means being afraid
2016-08-17 14:45:46	RoboIan	Wait, really?
2016-08-17 14:45:57	RoboIan	I'm not Scarsdale!
2016-08-17 14:46:05	RoboIan	Uh, what the heck?
2016-08-17 14:46:16	RoboIan	I mean I'm not scared!
2016-08-17 14:46:35	@PikFan	This is a definition I found:
2016-08-17 14:46:38	@PikFan	"suspicion and mistrust of people or their actions without evidence or justification"
2016-08-17 14:46:56	RoboIan	What the heck 2x?
2016-08-17 14:47:04	@PikFan	So basically, being afraid, but for no good reason
2016-08-17 14:47:27	Yoshi2	we can agree that it is important that the police does their work
2016-08-17 14:47:32	RoboIan	Ok, I get your point.
2016-08-17 14:47:42	RoboIan	Both of your points.
2016-08-17 14:47:44	@PikFan	Yoshi2: yes
2016-08-17 14:50:05	RoboIan	I am going to play some Egg Inc. now. Cya!

2016-08-17 16:23:44	@PikFan	but come on, it's just 1 more server
2016-08-17 16:23:51	@PikFan	how many servers are people in? sheesh
2016-08-17 16:24:05	@PikFan	and it's not like I'm ASKING YOU TO BE IN IT
2016-08-17 16:24:26	@PikFan	it's just there if you'd like to join
2016-08-17 16:24:41	 *	@PikFan can't ever do anything right lol
2016-08-17 16:24:48	Yoshi2	1) either you clutter people's sidebar with more servers
2016-08-17 16:25:02	Yoshi2	or 2) you clutter the user list with people who are only there for fanon
2016-08-17 16:25:11	Yoshi2	pick yer poison
2016-08-17 16:25:23	@PikFan	he did say that you can isolate users into just one channel though
2016-08-17 16:25:28	@PikFan	so there's that
2016-08-17 16:26:23	@PikFan	I created the server with the mindset that there are users in the Pikmin server that dislike Fanon and its users
2016-08-17 16:26:40	@PikFan	and now I'm being told "oh you could've just made a new channel"
2016-08-17 16:26:47	@PikFan	make up your mind people >_>
2016-08-17 16:27:31	@PikFan	but yeah, I'll ask Espyo
2016-08-17 16:27:54	@PikFan	...and he completely ignored my invite request
2016-08-17 16:27:56	@PikFan	._.
2016-08-17 16:28:26	@PikFan	I'm becoming more biased against him with each second
2016-08-17 16:28:50	Yoshi2	well, espyo is at work atm
2016-08-17 16:28:54	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-17 16:29:15	Yoshi2	a separate server would help with the invite thing
2016-08-17 16:29:34	Yoshi2	could handle invites for one differently than for the other, unless there is a way to make an invite so that it is only for a channel
2016-08-17 16:29:46	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-17 16:30:25	@PikFan	...why am I even worrying over this
2016-08-17 16:30:33	@PikFan	I'm doing this for fanon, not them
2016-08-17 16:30:59	Yoshi2	My Life For Fanon!
2016-08-17 16:31:05	@PikFan	:p
2016-08-17 16:33:12	@PikFan	ugh
2016-08-17 16:33:19	@PikFan	I'm not sure I should ask again
2016-08-17 16:33:24	@PikFan	I don't want to sound annoying
2016-08-17 16:33:33	@PikFan	I feel like he's irritated with me
2016-08-17 16:33:59	@PikFan	especially cause we got into a debate yesterday over Pikmin 4 and what it'll release on
2016-08-17 16:34:19	@PikFan	maybe I'm being overly sensitive
2016-08-17 16:35:03	@PikFan	http://pastebin.com/edsQAFy3
2016-08-17 16:35:25	@PikFan	I hope I didn't sound rude
2016-08-17 16:36:19	Yoshi2	PikFan: pretty sure you did not sound rude
2016-08-17 16:36:35	@PikFan	that's what I figured
2016-08-17 16:37:33	Yoshi2	looks like I have to poke espyo to get an invite
2016-08-17 16:37:44	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-08-17 16:37:49	@PikFan	sorry :\
2016-08-17 16:37:59	Yoshi2	pulling those connections i have
2016-08-17 16:38:08	Yoshi2	(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ 
2016-08-17 16:44:48	Yoshi2	a discord just for fanon is not a completely bad idea. He mentioned being able to limit people to a channel, but that kinda works better with admin-only channels (you give people additional permissions) than it works with a fanon-only channel (you basically have to take away everything except a few permissions)
2016-08-17 16:45:04	Yoshi2	if I understand the permission system of discord correctly
2016-08-17 16:45:44	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-17 16:48:48	Yoshi2	the taking away permissions can be done somewhat easily with roles, but that makes them second rate citizens which is hngggggggggggggggg
2016-08-17 16:49:05	@PikFan	lol oh well, sacrifices must be made

2016-08-17 17:52:05	RoboIan	Hey guys!
2016-08-17 17:52:23	RoboIan	So, is the picture done yet?
2016-08-17 17:52:44	@PikFan	no
2016-08-17 17:52:51	@PikFan	my friend still isn't awake :P
2016-08-17 17:53:00	RoboIan	Why in the world?
2016-08-17 17:53:06	RoboIan	It's almost noon!
2016-08-17 17:53:14	Yoshi2	different timezones
2016-08-17 17:53:27	@PikFan	she's actually 1 hour ahead of you
2016-08-17 17:53:33	@PikFan	but she went to bed pretty late last night
2016-08-17 17:53:38	@PikFan	around 5 am her time I think
2016-08-17 17:53:52	Yoshi2	or that, different sleeping schedule
2016-08-17 17:53:57	@PikFan	^
2016-08-17 17:54:22	Yoshi2	even if she was awake, I would be suprised if the picture was done today
2016-08-17 17:54:34	RoboIan	Well, to me, it is almost noon.
2016-08-17 17:54:48	@PikFan	oh, why do you say that, Yoshi2?
2016-08-17 17:55:16	RoboIan	What PikFan said.
2016-08-17 17:55:33	Yoshi2	PikFan: what if she had different plans and had to do different stuff first before being able to do the picture?
2016-08-17 17:55:49	@PikFan	but what if she doesn't
2016-08-17 17:55:55	RoboIan	Ok, now your giving me a headache.
2016-08-17 17:56:08	RoboIan	Not really.
2016-08-17 17:56:16	@PikFan	lmao
2016-08-17 17:56:19	Yoshi2	my point is
2016-08-17 17:56:27	Yoshi2	RoboIan: you should have a bit more patience :P
2016-08-17 17:56:34	@PikFan	mhm
2016-08-17 17:56:42	@PikFan	good things come to those who wait
2016-08-17 17:56:42	RoboIan	I can tell, Yoshi2.

2016-08-17 18:38:07	@PikFan	:P
2016-08-17 18:38:21	Yoshi2	it's about terrain modding in battalion wars

2016-08-17 18:38:37	@PikFan	sounds crazy
2016-08-17 18:38:51	Yoshi2	why do you think so
2016-08-17 18:39:11	@PikFan	because editing the terrain seems like something that wouldn't happen :P

2016-08-17 19:15:14	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-17 19:16:14	Yoshi2	Espyo: i heard the pikmin discord is already a thing, but I have no invite :<
2016-08-17 19:18:14	@Espyo	more like Pikmin Wiki
2016-08-17 19:18:18	@Espyo	but I'll give you on, hold on
2016-08-17 19:21:41	Yoshi2	oh wow, the discord is quite busy in terms of amount of people
2016-08-17 19:22:19	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-17 19:22:46	@Espyo	the guys that used to be on the wikia, and came to us on the merge, had a skype group, and are mostly normal friends to one another
2016-08-17 19:22:50	@Espyo	so already a big number as is
2016-08-17 19:23:01	@Espyo	then add to that me, Marty, Scruffy, PikFan, probably others that eventually joined...
2016-08-17 19:23:54	@PikFan	oh, hey Espyo
2016-08-17 19:24:06	@PikFan	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-08-17 19:24:13	@Espyo	hi PikFan
2016-08-17 19:24:19	@PikFan	I saw your opinion of the Pikmin Fanon discord thing
2016-08-17 19:24:56	@PikFan	I... guess we can make a new channel
2016-08-17 19:25:10	@PikFan	but is it really possible to isolate people to just one room?
2016-08-17 19:25:20	@PikFan	and how would invites work?
2016-08-17 19:25:34	@Espyo	invites are per-channel
2016-08-17 19:26:02	@PikFan	hm
2016-08-17 19:26:31	@Espyo	although
2016-08-17 19:26:35	@Espyo	everybody is on the server at once
2016-08-17 19:26:38	@Espyo	hm, I'm not sure
2016-08-17 19:26:41	@Espyo	but it looks like Luther does, so
2016-08-17 19:27:18	@PikFan	I had created the separate server with the mindset that some users dislike Fanon and its users
2016-08-17 19:27:44	@PikFan	and wouldn't necessarily want to be around that
2016-08-17 19:28:34	@Espyo	yeah, like I said, I agree
2016-08-17 19:28:37	@Espyo	I wouldn't say they DISLIKE
2016-08-17 19:28:51	@Espyo	I mean, I'm sure most of them dislike (but not HATE) most of the fanon ideas
2016-08-17 19:28:55	@Espyo	but from there to disliking the users?
2016-08-17 19:28:56	@Espyo	I don't think so
2016-08-17 19:29:02	@Espyo	regardless, having a bit of organization is important
2016-08-17 19:29:13	@Espyo	otherwise the concept of channel is pointless
2016-08-17 19:29:41	@PikFan	I guess so
2016-08-17 19:32:21	@PikFan	I still feel like the users would dislike having a channel just for fanon though
2016-08-17 19:32:43	@Espyo	eh, maybe
2016-08-17 19:32:52	@Espyo	thing is, that serve serves for two things atm
2016-08-17 19:32:59	@Espyo	one for a place for the old friends to talk
2016-08-17 19:33:03	@Espyo	personal stuff and all
2016-08-17 19:33:08	@Espyo	and two for Pikipedia, much like this IRC
2016-08-17 19:33:19	@Espyo	so, it makes sense to split things
2016-08-17 19:33:27	@Espyo	splitting between fanon and Pikipedia though...
2016-08-17 19:33:29	@Espyo	eh, could work, could not

2016-08-17 20:54:44	@Espyo	could just be a VLC hiccup
2016-08-17 20:54:47	@Espyo	other than that, this is great
2016-08-17 20:54:58	@Espyo	don't worry about your accent, it sounds fine enough
2016-08-17 20:55:14	@Espyo	though, there's a bit of fuzzy noise that becomes apparent when you stop and start talking
2016-08-17 20:55:19	@Espyo	tried using Audacity's noise filter?
2016-08-17 20:56:27	Yoshi2	in youtube it ends with "comment section below"
2016-08-17 20:56:47	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-08-17 20:57:54	Marty2000	" in youtube it ends with "comment section below" " Yes
2016-08-17 20:58:08	@Espyo	I wouldn't worry then
2016-08-17 20:58:30	Yoshi2	the fuzzy noise you mention is static and I did not use the noise filter, instead I cut out as much of the noise before and after I talked and hoped my beautiful voice would hide the rest

2016-08-17 21:00:02	@Espyo	well, truth be told, it does hide it almost all the time
2016-08-17 21:00:11	@Espyo	but it hit me really jarringly on like the 2nd or 3rd time you spoke
2016-08-17 21:00:13	@Espyo	that's why I brought it up
2016-08-17 21:00:19	@Espyo	the rest of the video, I honestly didn't notice it much
2016-08-17 21:00:29	@Espyo	(or I subconsciously didn't notice it because I already knew it was something I knew)
2016-08-17 21:00:33	Yoshi2	I guess for next time I will try harder to reduce the noise
2016-08-17 21:00:50	@Espyo	don't overdo it if you can't

2016-08-17 21:15:07	Yoshi2	I think I had some earlier takes where I used the noise reduction and the static was gone but my voice also sounded bass-less
2016-08-17 21:15:20	Yoshi2	and I do not remember if the original take was that way already, or
2016-08-17 21:15:24	Yoshi2	if the noise reduction did it
2016-08-17 21:16:04	Yoshi2	so when I redid it and it sounded decent without noise reduction, I avoided using it

2016-08-18 19:36:19	Testyo	Evening everyone!
2016-08-18 19:36:59	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-08-18 19:37:00	Testyo	oh oh
2016-08-18 19:42:15	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and Testyo
2016-08-18 19:42:15	Testyo	I don't think my connection is great
2016-08-18 19:44:05	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-18 19:44:15	@Espyo	well, Testyo, your connection is my connection, so you're right
2016-08-18 19:44:16	Testyo	so looking foward to hearing that song...it always put me in the mood to dance!
2016-08-18 19:44:22	@Espyo	uhm
2016-08-18 19:57:20	Marty2000	Oh, Espyo, about this http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Glitches_in_Pikmin_3&curid=8429&diff=168550&oldid=168459
2016-08-18 19:57:30	Marty2000	I think it really tried the Invulnerable Pikmin glitch
2016-08-18 19:57:34	Marty2000	because this user
2016-08-18 19:57:39	Marty2000	has started following my channel recently
2016-08-18 19:57:45	Marty2000	and posted some comments
2016-08-18 19:57:49	@Espyo	hah
2016-08-18 19:57:52	@Espyo	well, likely
2016-08-18 19:57:59	Marty2000	I think he posted one on my Invincible Pikmin video
2016-08-18 19:58:04	Marty2000	so he probably used the glitch :p
2016-08-18 19:58:12	@Espyo	but still, we can check if Reds can be thrown into the water by being clung to a Toady Bloyster

2016-08-18 20:44:02	Marty2000	That could be helpful if we knew how to reproduce that

2016-08-18 20:44:54	Marty2000	I can try that tomorrow

2016-08-18 20:47:57	@PikFan	THE FUCK?
2016-08-18 20:48:06	Marty2000	I can't see what would cause this
2016-08-18 20:48:10	@Espyo	my words exactly
2016-08-18 20:48:16	Marty2000	But it's worth trying over

2016-08-18 20:48:21	Marty2000	He he
2016-08-18 20:48:24	@Espyo	they're speculating two things
2016-08-18 20:48:39	@Espyo	either because the second Winged Pikmin grabbed the bomb-rock and joined the party at the same time they entered the cave
2016-08-18 20:48:50	@Espyo	or because the explosion happened when the sun meter reached half (unlikely)
2016-08-18 20:49:07	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-18 20:49:25	@Espyo	all right, never mind the sun meter theory
2016-08-18 20:52:02	@PikFan	can't wait to see the discord's reaction

2016-08-18 21:00:16	@PikFan	oh wow

2016-08-18 21:00:40	@PikFan	how come he never asked for an invite to the Pikmin wiki discord?
2016-08-18 21:00:48	@Espyo	guess he didn't know of it
2016-08-18 21:00:55	@PikFan	heh
2016-08-18 21:01:00	@Espyo	not everybody knows about every discord thing out there, I'm realizing

2016-08-19 01:52:37	@PikFan	hi
2016-08-19 01:54:00	Lord_Juffowup	Im uploading a video on an interesting find
2016-08-19 01:54:12	Lord_Juffowup	I generated a cave file so big it went outside the skybox
2016-08-19 01:54:39	@PikFan	woah what
2016-08-19 01:55:33	Lord_Juffowup	It was a huge metal maze, its the room used in the subterranean complex and dream den, the one with bomb-rocks and volatile dweevils that fall from the ceiling
2016-08-19 01:55:48	Lord_Juffowup	But instead of one room, I made it so there was 12
2016-08-19 01:55:54	@PikFan	woah
2016-08-19 01:56:02	@PikFan	I'm looking forward to this video
2016-08-19 01:56:27	Lord_Juffowup	The wall apparently isn't solid, you can walk through it

2016-08-19 19:39:10	@PikFan	unfortunately, me being my dumb self, I forgot to ask my friend to recolor
2016-08-19 19:39:28	RoboIan	Darn it!
2016-08-19 19:39:30	@PikFan	so, here's what I'll do
2016-08-19 19:39:40	@PikFan	I'll download GIMP and do it myself
2016-08-19 19:39:50	@PikFan	problem is, though
2016-08-19 19:39:50	RoboIan	Good idea.
2016-08-19 19:40:10	@PikFan	I'm going to be out of town this weekend, and won't have access to the laptop
2016-08-19 19:40:13	@PikFan	I'll be on mobile
2016-08-19 19:40:22	@PikFan	so I won't be able to use GIMP right away
2016-08-19 19:40:29	RoboIan	Then bring the laptop with you!
2016-08-19 19:40:34	@PikFan	can't
2016-08-19 19:40:38	@PikFan	it's not mine
2016-08-19 19:40:58	RoboIan	I was going to say it's cord powered but it's not yours?
2016-08-19 19:41:13	@PikFan	nope
2016-08-19 19:41:19	@PikFan	it's my mom's lol
2016-08-19 19:41:23	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-08-19 19:41:35	@PikFan	I'll be home Sunday afternoon or evening
2016-08-19 19:41:39	RoboIan	Well, I don't have my own laptop either.
2016-08-19 19:41:58	RoboIan	I use daddy's computer, however, it is cord powered.
2016-08-19 19:42:02	@PikFan	and as soon as I get home, I'll download GIMP and make the picture
2016-08-19 19:42:15	@PikFan	okay?
2016-08-19 19:42:21	RoboIan	Ok.

2016-08-20 00:01:25	Marty2000	Remember when I said that sound could be in Wii Party,
2016-08-20 00:01:27	Marty2000	?*
2016-08-20 00:01:44	Marty2000	Well, I managed to find that sound
2016-08-20 00:01:50	Marty2000	and I showed it to Scruffy
2016-08-20 00:01:55	@Espyo	ah, cool
2016-08-20 00:01:56	Marty2000	He confirmed it was the same sound ;)
2016-08-20 00:02:04	Marty2000	A few minutes after you left
2016-08-20 00:02:16	Marty2000	Yep, cool
2016-08-20 00:02:22	@Espyo	can you add it to the wiki?
2016-08-20 00:02:39	Marty2000	I guess there are many other sounds used throughout Nintendo games
2016-08-20 00:02:42	Marty2000	Sure
2016-08-20 00:02:53	Marty2000	I must find the name of the mini-game, though
2016-08-20 00:03:07	Marty2000	It must be in the video
2016-08-20 00:03:22	@Espyo	probably
2016-08-20 00:03:42	@Espyo	wait, it's the Research Pod / Prince Bully sound, right?
2016-08-20 00:03:52	@Espyo	I thought it was a different sound in the Occupational Hazards at first
2016-08-20 00:04:10	Marty2000	Yes, it's that sound
2016-08-20 00:05:22	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/Apsz0FmqNxc?t=46m56s
2016-08-20 00:05:33	Marty2000	When the Mii ball turns into a real Mii
2016-08-20 00:06:46	Marty2000	"Roll to the Goal"
2016-08-20 00:08:29	Marty2000	You sure you want to add it to the wiki? It was just more of a little thing I wanted to point out, but I can add it if you find this interesting enough to be on the article
2016-08-20 00:12:25	@Espyo	right, since we already mention this sound is elsewhere
2016-08-20 00:12:29	@Espyo	I don't think it's important to do it
2016-08-20 00:12:30	@Espyo	although
2016-08-20 00:12:47	@Espyo	we should replace it with the SM3DW mention if Wii Party came first
2016-08-20 00:12:54	@Espyo	...it's called WII Party, so I'm guessing it did
2016-08-20 00:13:16	@Espyo	*we should replace the Wii Party mention with SM3DW
2016-08-20 00:13:39	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-20 00:14:30	@Espyo	since the idea is not so much to explain what other games have these sounds
2016-08-20 00:14:37	@Espyo	as much as it is to try to indicate that they came from something else
2016-08-20 00:14:47	@Espyo	and saying they came from Wii Party is more accurate than saying they came from SM3DW
2016-08-20 00:15:09	@Espyo	they might've come from an earlier game, but since we're not explicitly saying it's the first ever time the sound was present in a Nintendo game, it's just some trivia, I don't think it matters that much

2016-08-21 12:37:19	Testyo	well, there is quite a bit wrong with my code
2016-08-21 12:37:48	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-08-21 12:37:48	Testyo	its getting dark, the lawn might be wet from the framerate to get it to load faster (might be placebo)

2016-08-21 12:38:11	Marty2000	Such weirdness, as always :p
2016-08-21 12:38:58	@Espyo	yyyyyep
2016-08-21 13:01:25	Marty2000	I've just recalled something I wanted to point out
2016-08-21 13:01:28	Marty2000	[[Pluck]]
2016-08-21 13:01:28	Testyo	"Pluck" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pluck
2016-08-21 13:01:41	Marty2000	"In Pikmin, if the camera's distance is not set to the closest, it will zoom in on Captain Olimar when he begins plucking, and will return to the previous zoom setting some seconds after he stops. This only happens on the first and second days, so presumably, it was implemented in order to better show new players how plucking works, up close."
2016-08-21 13:01:48	Marty2000	" This only happens on the first and second days"
2016-08-21 13:02:07	Marty2000	Without checking the game, I am 99% sure that this is not the right explanation
2016-08-21 13:02:15	Marty2000	Because, if you attempt a 50-Pikmin speedrun
2016-08-21 13:02:22	Marty2000	You can still have this on day 30
2016-08-21 13:02:37	Marty2000	I think it's based on the number of Pikmin you've plucked so far
2016-08-21 13:02:49	Marty2000	or grown
2016-08-21 13:13:04	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-21 13:13:06	@Espyo	interesting
2016-08-21 13:13:09	@Espyo	worth checking
2016-08-21 13:13:25	@Espyo	you can add a {{game help}} note to the page so we don't forget to check this later

2016-08-21 13:13:56	@Espyo	oh, okay
2016-08-21 13:14:03	Marty2000	Hmmm... I have 5-6 hours, so I have some time
2016-08-21 13:14:15	Marty2000	Adding the template

2016-08-21 13:39:11	Marty2000	I have unlocked all types of Pikmin, I'm on day 4, I've grown and plucked 33 Pikmin, and I still have the zoom thing happening
2016-08-21 13:39:48	Marty2000	I'll throw some Pikmin into a Candypop Bud to se eif it's related to the number of times I pluck
2016-08-21 13:39:57	Marty2000	see if*
2016-08-21 13:40:15	Marty2000	If the zoom thing doesn't stop after a while, I'll try growing more Pikmin.
2016-08-21 13:41:01	Marty2000	I'm using some Action Replay code to have all areas unlocked, by the way
2016-08-21 13:41:04	Marty2000	Makes things faster
2016-08-21 13:41:36	@Espyo	all right
2016-08-21 13:54:14	Marty2000	When plucking the 101th Pikmin, it stops
2016-08-21 13:54:30	Marty2000	And I've only grown 33 Pikmin
2016-08-21 13:54:37	Marty2000	I'm recycling Pikmin with Candypop Buds
2016-08-21 13:54:52	Marty2000	So, I think it stops once the player has plucked 100 Pikmin
2016-08-21 13:55:23	Marty2000	which means the game may keep track of the number of Pikmin plcuked so far (?)
2016-08-21 13:55:29	Marty2000	plucked*
2016-08-21 13:57:00	Marty2000	I can add it, unless I should test something else to ake sure I'm right
2016-08-21 13:57:02	Marty2000	make*
2016-08-21 14:10:26	@Espyo	wow, 100, really?
2016-08-21 14:10:27	@Espyo	hmm
2016-08-21 14:10:32	@Espyo	something doesn't seem to be adding up, then
2016-08-21 14:10:40	@Espyo	try this:
2016-08-21 14:10:50	@Espyo	do day 1 like normal
2016-08-21 14:10:55	@Espyo	save at the end of day 1
2016-08-21 14:10:59	@Espyo	shut down the console
2016-08-21 14:11:01	@Espyo	turn it back on
2016-08-21 14:11:03	@Espyo	start day 2
2016-08-21 14:11:08	@Espyo	and see if you get the zoom-in
2016-08-21 14:11:16	Marty2000	Okay.
2016-08-21 14:11:20	@Espyo	I say this because, if I had to guess it was based on a number, I'd guess 50, just like you did before
2016-08-21 14:11:25	@Espyo	 100 seems way too high
2016-08-21 14:11:31	@Espyo	so many Pikmin before it stops doing the zoom
2016-08-21 14:11:35	@Espyo	so I'm thinking
2016-08-21 14:11:42	@Espyo	maybe the game doesn't keep memory of how many you plucked
2016-08-21 14:11:47	@Espyo	so if you shut off the console, that info is lost
2016-08-21 14:12:05	@Espyo	and when you continue on a day that isn't day 1, the game just assumes you've plucked enough Pikmin to get the idea, and doesn't zoom in any more
2016-08-21 14:12:20	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-21 14:12:26	Marty2000	I'm trying
2016-08-21 14:12:32	Marty2000	I'm using Dolphin, though
2016-08-21 14:12:35	Marty2000	Is that a problem?
2016-08-21 14:12:39	Marty2000	I don't use savestates
2016-08-21 14:12:47	@Espyo	shouldn't be a problem, no
2016-08-21 14:12:50	Marty2000	So I can do as I'd do on a normal console
2016-08-21 14:12:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-08-21 14:13:22	Yoshi2	for the most part dolphin is pretty close to the normal console
2016-08-21 14:13:40	Marty2000	Well, yeah
2016-08-21 14:14:14	Marty2000	but I prefer to ask anyway :p
2016-08-21 14:14:34	Yoshi2	make a discovery in dolphin -> at a later point find some poor soul who would try to recreate it on console
2016-08-21 14:17:12	@Espyo	hehe
2016-08-21 14:17:14	@Espyo	pretty much
2016-08-21 14:21:47	Marty2000	Ending day 1. Saving and restarting Dolphin
2016-08-21 14:23:40	Marty2000	I'm still getting the zoom-in, Espyo.
2016-08-21 14:24:12	@Espyo	interesting
2016-08-21 14:24:17	@Espyo	well, guess that's all there is to it
2016-08-21 14:24:22	@Espyo	it's a 100-Pikmin limit
2016-08-21 14:24:52	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-21 14:24:59	Marty2000	Will add it
2016-08-21 14:26:47	@Espyo	thank you
2016-08-21 14:27:00	@Espyo	meanwhile, I was asked on the speedrunning channel to try going to the Emergence Cave on day 1
2016-08-21 14:27:02	@Espyo	it's working well
2016-08-21 14:27:06	Marty2000	No problem
2016-08-21 14:27:07	@Espyo	I just took the paper bags out of the way
2016-08-21 14:27:08	Marty2000	Yes it does
2016-08-21 14:27:24	@Espyo	"it does"?
2016-08-21 14:27:37	Marty2000	Although I got a glitch once, my Pikmin wouldn't respond to me
2016-08-21 14:27:43	Marty2000	Yes it does work well
2016-08-21 14:27:48	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-21 14:27:52	@Espyo	you got without hacks?
2016-08-21 14:28:01	Marty2000	With hacks, always :p

2016-08-21 14:28:17	@Espyo	were you able to bring Pikmin with you?
2016-08-21 14:28:23	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-21 14:28:28	@Espyo	how?
2016-08-21 14:28:48	Marty2000	Hmm, I think I didn't do anything particular
2016-08-21 14:29:02	Marty2000	besides throwing them somewhere I can reach before entering the cave
2016-08-21 14:29:17	@Espyo	hmm
2016-08-21 14:29:24	@Espyo	well, did the game crash when you entered the cave?
2016-08-21 14:29:34	Marty2000	No
2016-08-21 14:29:40	@Espyo	crashed for me
2016-08-21 14:29:50	@Espyo	wait, did you try going in the cave before even switching to Louie?

2016-08-21 14:29:52	@Espyo	because that's what I did
2016-08-21 14:29:53	Marty2000	Also, this allows you to see that the "abandon treasures" option is disabled on the pause menu
2016-08-21 14:29:56	Marty2000	No
2016-08-21 14:30:01	Marty2000	You have to switch to Louie
2016-08-21 14:30:02	@Espyo	right
2016-08-21 14:30:06	@Espyo	not in my case
2016-08-21 14:30:14	@Espyo	I moved the obstacles out of the way and got in without Louie
2016-08-21 14:30:24	Marty2000	Similarly, if you kill the Dwarf Red Bulborb before meeting the Red Pikmin (1 hit KO hack)
2016-08-21 14:30:29	Marty2000	the game freezes
2016-08-21 14:30:33	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-21 14:30:47	Marty2000	Try to kill the Dwarf Red Bulborb so the ship can talk
2016-08-21 14:30:51	@Espyo	but it could've crashed because of my janky ROM
2016-08-21 14:30:54	@Espyo	I've made so many edits to it
2016-08-21 14:30:55	Marty2000	which allows you to switch to Louie
2016-08-21 14:31:03	Marty2000	Once you've switched to Louie
2016-08-21 14:31:10	Marty2000	you don't have to do anything else with him
2016-08-21 14:31:14	Marty2000	You can just get back to Olimar
2016-08-21 14:31:19	Marty2000	No need to discover the Red Onion
2016-08-21 14:31:28	@Espyo	oh, so it's my fault
2016-08-21 14:31:33	@Espyo	I broke something on the Emergence Cave

2016-08-21 14:31:55	@Espyo	yeah, but I'm able to go in the EC without even switching
2016-08-21 14:31:58	@Espyo	so the less steps taken, the better
2016-08-21 14:32:12	Marty2000	Well, yeah
2016-08-21 14:32:24	Marty2000	But the game doesn't like it when you don't switch to Louie on day 1
2016-08-21 14:32:33	Marty2000	I don't know why, but I had several glitches happen with that
2016-08-21 14:32:34	@Espyo	really?
2016-08-21 14:32:42	@Espyo	I was doing fine until it crashed on the Emergence Cave
2016-08-21 14:33:03	Marty2000	For example, I didn't switch to Louie and my game would crash whenever I went to the Awakening Wood
2016-08-21 14:33:09	@Espyo	hah
2016-08-21 14:33:51	Marty2000	Similarly, if you recover the debt on day 1
2016-08-21 14:34:02	Marty2000	Naturally, on day 2, you'd have the President
2016-08-21 14:34:13	Marty2000	who replaces Louie during the cutscenes
2016-08-21 14:34:23	Marty2000	But when you get to the Awkening Wood, the game crashes again
2016-08-21 14:34:56	Marty2000	Come to think of it, the cutscenes are funny to watch, since the President isn't meant to replace Louie
2016-08-21 14:35:02	Marty2000	I think I showed a pic' of that here once
2016-08-21 14:35:08	Marty2000	Let me see if I still have them
2016-08-21 14:35:55	Marty2000	I have some
2016-08-21 14:36:02	@Espyo	hehe
2016-08-21 14:36:04	@Espyo	you did
2016-08-21 14:36:06	@Espyo	it looked so weird
2016-08-21 14:36:55	Marty2000	I've got 6 screenshots
2016-08-21 14:37:08	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/33/1471786616-alternate-2.png

2016-08-21 14:37:26	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/33/1471786612-the-president-with-louie-s-eyes.jpg
2016-08-21 14:37:30	Marty2000	Five, actually
2016-08-21 14:37:36	Marty2000	Sorry, I don't know how to count :p
2016-08-21 14:37:46	Marty2000	I'm surprised the game doesn't glitch for that part, to be honest
2016-08-21 14:37:54	Marty2000	I mean, crash
2016-08-21 14:39:06	Marty2000	Also, if you somehow manage to pluck the first Red Pikmin with Olimar
2016-08-21 14:39:13	Marty2000	the game will switch to Louie during the cutscene
2016-08-21 14:39:25	Marty2000	So you can teleport Louie near the red Onion
2016-08-21 14:39:32	@Espyo	heh
2016-08-21 14:39:33	Marty2000	... which cna give interesting results
2016-08-21 14:39:42	Marty2000	If you kill Louie
2016-08-21 14:39:45	Marty2000	and pluck that Pikmin
2016-08-21 14:39:51	Marty2000	the cutscene will play as normal
2016-08-21 14:40:08	Marty2000	and then, Louie will appear near the Red Onion, without his blue light on top of hil helmet
2016-08-21 14:40:13	Marty2000	like the Dweevil glitch
2016-08-21 14:40:18	@Espyo	ah, yeah
2016-08-21 14:40:18	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/33/1471786717-glitch-2.jpg
2016-08-21 14:40:31	Marty2000	(or the President)
2016-08-21 14:40:43	@Espyo	ok, I'm inside the Emergence Cave without ever switching to Louie
2016-08-21 14:40:45	@Espyo	and...
2016-08-21 14:40:50	@Espyo	the game won't let me call the Red Pikmin
2016-08-21 14:41:08	@Espyo	leaders also can't call each other
2016-08-21 14:41:11	Marty2000	Yes, you need to reunite Louie and Olimar (by crushing the bag)
2016-08-21 14:41:13	Marty2000	I think it's that
2016-08-21 14:41:27	Marty2000	Yep, so that's it
2016-08-21 14:42:21	Marty2000	Because the game doesn't allow a leader to call the other one before the bag gets crushed
2016-08-21 14:42:24	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-21 14:43:23	@Espyo	ok, once you enter the EC, you can't get Pikmin back any more
2016-08-21 14:43:42	@Espyo	uh, the Red Onion vanished
2016-08-21 14:43:44	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-21 14:43:51	Marty2000	Heh
2016-08-21 14:43:59	@Espyo	oh, LOUIE can control the Pikmin
2016-08-21 14:44:00	@Espyo	Olimar can't
2016-08-21 14:44:11	@Espyo	wait, the Red Onion is at the landing site
2016-08-21 14:44:12	@Espyo	hurr
2016-08-21 14:44:17	@Espyo	and I just triggered its discovery cutscene
2016-08-21 14:44:26	Marty2000	which will bring Louie around
2016-08-21 14:44:27	@Espyo	LOL
2016-08-21 14:44:28	@Espyo	WHAT
2016-08-21 14:44:36	Marty2000	The eyes glitcheD?
2016-08-21 14:44:38	Marty2000	He he
2016-08-21 14:44:41	Marty2000	glitched
2016-08-21 14:44:44	@Espyo	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/33/1471786610-the-president-has-4-eyes.jpg
2016-08-21 14:44:44	Marty2000	*
2016-08-21 14:44:47	@Espyo	I got this, but with Louie
2016-08-21 14:44:53	Marty2000	Yep
2016-08-21 14:45:00	Marty2000	Fun, isn't it? Hah
2016-08-21 14:45:56	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-21 14:46:04	@Espyo	I ended up drowning the Red Pikmin
2016-08-21 14:46:06	@Espyo	extinction
2016-08-21 14:46:10	@Espyo	ended the day with no treasure
2016-08-21 14:46:39	Marty2000	I think it's fine as long as you don't try to go to the Awakening Wood
2016-08-21 14:46:48	Marty2000	Try to get a treasure before going there
2016-08-21 14:46:49	@Espyo	ok, now I have to go for an extinction before Louie reaches the Onion
2016-08-21 14:46:54	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-21 14:46:56	@Espyo	oh, I closed the game, sorry
2016-08-21 14:47:17	Marty2000	Oh, no, I was just saying so in case you wanted to go there later ;)
2016-08-21 14:47:40	Marty2000	because you will get the same glitch as me, probably
2016-08-21 14:47:47	Marty2000	if you don't get at least one treasure
2016-08-21 14:47:57	@Espyo	right
2016-08-21 14:47:58	Marty2000	that is, the game will crash
2016-08-21 14:49:34	@Espyo	ok, extinction on day 1 was easy
2016-08-21 14:49:38	@Espyo	the Onion's landing with me...
2016-08-21 14:49:41	@Espyo	(at the start of day 2)
2016-08-21 14:50:01	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-21 14:50:04	@Espyo	and the Onion gave out a seed
2016-08-21 14:50:14	@Espyo	plucking it triggered the Red Pikmin intro cutscene
2016-08-21 14:50:25	@Espyo	and yep, Louie is the one on the cutscene
2016-08-21 14:50:50	@Espyo	I can't switch to Louie
2016-08-21 14:50:51	@Espyo	hm
2016-08-21 14:51:26	Marty2000	Hmmm...
2016-08-21 14:51:30	@Espyo	still can't whilst on the EC
2016-08-21 14:51:52	Marty2000	Did you kill the Dwarf Red bulborb and triggered a dialog from the Ship?
2016-08-21 14:52:01	Marty2000	(Louie is fine, I got news, .... something like that)
2016-08-21 14:52:41	Marty2000	I mean, did you kill it on day 1 already?
2016-08-21 14:52:57	@Espyo	I didn't
2016-08-21 14:53:32	@Espyo	hm, it's gone now
2016-08-21 14:53:35	Marty2000	Well, that explains it
2016-08-21 14:53:36	@Espyo	it was there at the start of day 2
2016-08-21 14:53:42	@Espyo	but vanished when I left the EC
2016-08-21 14:53:50	Marty2000	Yep, will disappear alongside some Pellet Posies
2016-08-21 14:54:07	@Espyo	right
2016-08-21 14:54:10	@Espyo	well, that's that
2016-08-21 14:54:10	Marty2000	(the ones that are supposed to appear where the Red onion was standing on day 1)
2016-08-21 14:54:15	Marty2000	Yes
2016-08-21 14:54:21	@Espyo	the guys wanted to find out what would happen if you got an extinction before finding the Red Onion
2016-08-21 14:54:23	@Espyo	and nothing really happens
2016-08-21 14:54:25	@Espyo	oh well
2016-08-21 14:54:59	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-21 15:18:31	Marty2000	Will try to sleep, might reconnect near my midnight
2016-08-21 15:18:33	Marty2000	See you soon

2016-08-21 21:45:36	Yoshi2	apparently they took down the trailer to that game, it is not on google play and it's chinese and chinese knockoffs are always hard to go after
2016-08-21 21:46:19	Yoshi2	so it's not a good contrast to AM2R

2016-08-22 20:49:29	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-22 20:49:35	@Espyo	hey Marty, that sound that's in Wii Party
2016-08-22 20:49:36	@Espyo	when does it play?
2016-08-22 20:53:20	Marty2000	When the balls transforms into a Mii
2016-08-22 20:53:46	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-22 20:53:48	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/Apsz0FmqNxc?t=46m56s
2016-08-22 20:54:01	Marty2000	No problem
2016-08-22 20:54:06	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-08-22 20:54:17	@Espyo	is that only in Roll to the Goal?
2016-08-22 20:54:45	Marty2000	I am not sure
2016-08-22 20:54:50	Marty2000	Probably not
2016-08-22 20:54:59	@Espyo	but it doesn't happen in all mini-games, does it?
2016-08-22 20:55:21	Marty2000	Not in all mini-games for sure, but it does happen in other mini-games, according to my memories
2016-08-22 20:55:33	Marty2000	I can try to find them on the video if you want
2016-08-22 20:55:37	@Espyo	that's okay
2016-08-22 20:55:43	@Espyo	I just wanted to know how to explain it on the wiki
2016-08-22 20:55:54	@Espyo	if the ball->Mii transformation is something that happens in all mini-games or not
2016-08-22 20:55:56	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-22 20:56:04	Marty2000	Oh, this
2016-08-22 20:56:05	Marty2000	No
2016-08-22 20:56:23	Marty2000	I thought you were talking about the sound only
2016-08-22 20:56:24	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-08-22 20:57:26	@Espyo	I was

2016-08-22 20:57:46	Marty2000	:p
2016-08-22 20:58:07	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-08-22 21:25:22	Marty2000	Might have found a sound from Pikmin in Wii Party. It's not worth adding since Pikmin was released before Wii Party, but still funny to point out:
2016-08-22 21:25:35	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/Apsz0FmqNxc?t=42m36s
2016-08-22 21:25:47	Marty2000	The sound of the bell reminds me of the sound that happens at noon

2016-08-22 22:17:26	Scruffy	Sorry about that
2016-08-22 22:17:37	@Espyo	heh, it's all right
2016-08-22 22:20:05	Scruffy	Wanted to show you this
2016-08-22 22:20:06	Scruffy	http://imgur.com/a/BJ47g
2016-08-22 22:20:17	@Espyo	hah!
2016-08-22 22:20:20	@Espyo	you did what Jordan requested
2016-08-22 22:20:28	@Espyo	great, that means I won't have to through the trouble of doing it
2016-08-22 22:20:38	Scruffy	Yep, I'll show it to him when he gets on discord
2016-08-22 22:20:46	Scruffy	I'm also about to try the Spectralid one
2016-08-22 22:22:13	Scruffy	I'm not sure if there's a limit on how many Dwarves will follow a Spotty Bulbear
2016-08-22 22:22:23	@Espyo	hm, good question
2016-08-22 22:22:29	Scruffy	But it appears that all of them will follow so far
2016-08-22 22:25:30	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-08-22 22:26:39	Scruffy	Hmm, it will only load two instances of the Spectralids
2016-08-22 22:26:50	Scruffy	The other groups will not be present
2016-08-22 22:26:57	Scruffy	At least, I think it's two
2016-08-22 22:27:49	Scruffy	Just as it won't let too many sprays on-screen at once, I guess
2016-08-22 22:29:25	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-08-22 23:18:22	Scruffy	Got some more interesting tidbits
2016-08-22 23:18:30	Scruffy	But, I did figure out that if the Courage Reactor makes it to the ship during the cutscene where Olimar and Louie are reunited (which cannot happen in the regular game), it will not be absorbed. The Pikmin will just stop carrying it there and pick it up once the cutscene is done
2016-08-22 23:18:47	Scruffy	This happens with any cutscene
2016-08-22 23:19:24	Scruffy	If a treasure makes it to the ship or an item to the Onion during a cutscene, the Pikmin just drop it and then pick it up once the cutscene is done
2016-08-22 23:19:37	Scruffy	Of course, these items have to be visible during the cutscene
2016-08-22 23:19:49	Scruffy	So treasure collection cutscenes don't count for this
2016-08-22 23:20:09	@Espyo	hm, interesting
2016-08-22 23:20:29	Scruffy	Also
2016-08-22 23:20:45	Scruffy	I tried collecting the second globe treasure before the first
2016-08-22 23:20:56	Scruffy	And then collecting the first on the day after
2016-08-22 23:21:03	Scruffy	So, I got the second globe, and as I did expect it assumed I already had the AW and gave me the Perplexing Pool intro with the Awakening Wood already there
2016-08-22 23:21:09	Scruffy	But
2016-08-22 23:21:15	Scruffy	When I went back on day 3 and got the first globe, the next day I had only the Valley of Repose and the Perplexing Pool, and then it gave me the Awakening Wood So I still end up with all three, but because there's a messed up order there's a little jump in the camera zoomout in the map selection screen
2016-08-22 23:21:26	Scruffy	But that's about it No crashes or anything
2016-08-22 23:21:32	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-08-22 23:21:37	@Espyo	I'm surprised it handles it well
2016-08-22 23:21:46	Scruffy	Yeah, me too, I was expecting a crash
2016-08-22 23:21:59	Scruffy	I've only ever had the game crash on me twice
2016-08-22 23:22:02	@Espyo	I've seen it crash for far, FAR less
2016-08-22 23:22:37	Scruffy	For me it crashed when I had 100 Pikmin out and the Red Onion was discovered
2016-08-22 23:22:55	Scruffy	And then again when I deflated the first bag before defeating the first Dwarf Red Bulborb
2016-08-22 23:23:05	Scruffy	But that's it
2016-08-22 23:23:16	@Espyo	hmm
2016-08-22 23:23:22	@Espyo	it likes to crash when you mess with some values the wrong way
2016-08-22 23:23:45	Scruffy	yeah
2016-08-22 23:24:21	Scruffy	Some other oddities: I know I have the second globe's carrying weight set to 1, but the game still somehow is bringing up 101
2016-08-22 23:24:36	Scruffy	It worked with the first globe though
2016-08-22 23:24:48	Scruffy	In fact, the first globe no longer shows carrying numbers over it
2016-08-22 23:25:02	Scruffy	Probably because I set the weight to 1 and the max carrying value to 1
2016-08-22 23:25:31	@Espyo	whaaa
2016-08-22 23:25:42	@Espyo	it's probably hardcoded
2016-08-22 23:25:44	@Espyo	which is super weird
2016-08-22 23:25:47	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-22 23:25:48	@Espyo	...but not weird enough for THIS game
2016-08-22 23:25:53	Scruffy	hehe
2016-08-22 23:26:28	Scruffy	I mean, makes sense, that's a good way to tell players not to attempt to add any more Pikmin to something like a Sheargrub
2016-08-22 23:27:41	Scruffy	But also, if I unearthed the second globe but didn't carry it anywhere (it was on a slope though, so it did move substantially), and then went through a cave, it was back to its original buried spot when I emerged
2016-08-22 23:27:56	@Espyo	oh, no, I mean that the second globe's weight being hardcoded is weird
2016-08-22 23:27:57	Scruffy	And buried again
2016-08-22 23:28:04	Scruffy	Oh
2016-08-22 23:28:06	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-08-22 23:31:22	Scruffy	That's all the science I found for today

2016-08-23 20:59:36	@PikFan	why does LoganPikmin insist on editing those other pages
2016-08-23 20:59:41	@Espyo	eesh
2016-08-23 20:59:46	@PikFan	all so he can get to some silly rank?
2016-08-23 20:59:57	@PikFan	I wonder if I should just do away with the rank system
2016-08-23 21:00:04	@Espyo	you probably should
2016-08-23 21:00:21	@PikFan	it does motivate them to make more edits

2016-08-23 21:01:03	@PikFan	discord just crashed on me again
2016-08-23 21:01:17	@PikFan	it's been doing this lately
2016-08-23 21:01:20	@PikFan	no idea why
2016-08-23 21:04:08	@PikFan	I'm inching closer and closer to just banning him already
2016-08-23 21:04:24	@PikFan	I'm getting tired of his antics
2016-08-23 21:04:41	@PikFan	but I need a good reason to ban him
2016-08-23 21:06:21	@PikFan	oh
2016-08-23 21:06:36	@PikFan	so somebody's been trolling Marty on a couple of his videos
2016-08-23 21:06:41	@PikFan	namely, his squid party videos
2016-08-23 21:06:53	@PikFan	and they're calling it "gay squid porn"
2016-08-23 21:06:54	@PikFan	wtf
2016-08-23 21:07:29	@PikFan	I know that you NEVER feed the trolls, but
2016-08-23 21:07:43	@PikFan	I decided to have a little fun and I commented "Awww, lookit! It's just another sad little troll that doesn't know how to do anything but hate. Lmao﻿"

2016-08-23 21:10:12	@PikFan	this isn't some game
2016-08-23 21:10:25	@PikFan	(though it is about games)
2016-08-23 21:10:40	 *	@PikFan is feeling a little bit trigger happy at the moment
2016-08-23 21:33:14	@Espyo	and you lost
2016-08-23 21:33:16	@Espyo	bad PikFan
2016-08-23 21:33:28	@Espyo	anyway, tell him what's up
2016-08-23 21:33:29	@PikFan	lel
2016-08-23 21:33:36	@Espyo	he probably doesn't understand why he's being so obnoxious
2016-08-23 21:34:04	@PikFan	yeah I want to be blunt with him
2016-08-23 21:34:16	@Espyo	might as well
2016-08-23 21:34:23	@Espyo	but actually do explain stuff, instead of saying like "stop that"
2016-08-23 22:00:26	@Espyo	what would be a synonym of "get your act together"?
2016-08-23 22:00:32	@Espyo	but preferably less aggressive
2016-08-23 22:05:47	Yoshi2	"please get your act together"
2016-08-23 22:05:52	@Espyo	welp
2016-08-23 22:05:56	@Espyo	can't say it's not
2016-08-23 22:07:08	Yoshi2	" to start to organize yourself so that you do things in an effective way"
2016-08-23 22:07:47	@Espyo	ok, now shorter
2016-08-23 22:09:25	Yoshi2	become more focused?
2016-08-23 22:09:39	@Espyo	more or less...
2016-08-23 22:10:01	@Espyo	I guess I want something that better means that "you had the spark, but lost it; get it back"
2016-08-23 22:10:06	@PikFan	I have told him before to focus only on his game
2016-08-23 22:10:08	@Espyo	not so much "you need to improve on what you have"
2016-08-23 22:11:20	Yoshi2	well,
2016-08-23 22:11:23	Yoshi2	you should
2016-08-23 22:11:33	Yoshi2	eh, get your act together?
2016-08-23 22:11:46	Yoshi2	i am not sure what this "spark" is 
2016-08-23 22:11:56	@Espyo	all right, imagine this person has a natural gift
2016-08-23 22:12:00	@Espyo	and their gift is needed
2016-08-23 22:12:09	@Espyo	and they use their gift effectively every day
2016-08-23 22:12:11	@Espyo	and everybody is happy
2016-08-23 22:12:18	@Espyo	but one day the results come out kinda crap
2016-08-23 22:12:27	@Espyo	so somebody else suggests that they take some time off
2016-08-23 22:12:32	@Espyo	so that they can get their act together
2016-08-23 22:12:34	@Espyo	or clear their mind
2016-08-23 22:12:35	@Espyo	or focus
2016-08-23 22:12:39	@Espyo	along those lines
2016-08-23 22:12:46	@Espyo	I guess I already said some
2016-08-23 22:13:14	@Espyo	but all of those are either too aggressive or too unrelated
2016-08-23 22:13:15	@Espyo	though
2016-08-23 22:13:20	@Espyo	okay, never mind, I like "clear the mind"
2016-08-23 22:13:21	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-23 22:13:57	Yoshi2	probably the best you can do
2016-08-23 22:14:16	@Espyo	seems so
2016-08-23 22:14:51	Yoshi2	(not sure what is wrong with a bit of aggressiveness though :P )
2016-08-23 22:14:59	@Espyo	depends on the context
2016-08-23 22:15:05	@Espyo	I want this one to sound encouraging
2016-08-23 22:15:16	@Espyo	but it can't be TOO uplifting since it's meant to be a bit informal
2016-08-23 22:15:22	@Espyo	strangely finicky, this
2016-08-23 22:18:57	@PikFan	I like this idea of asking him to take a break

2016-08-25 11:56:29	RandomYoshi	senpie
2016-08-25 11:56:35	RandomYoshi	I'm alive.
2016-08-25 11:57:03	RandomYoshi	I'm also getting into the Dragon Quest series at an alarming rate.
2016-08-25 11:57:28	RandomYoshi	I have in my possession I, II, III, IV, V, VI and IX.
2016-08-25 12:01:55	Marty2000	Please, Yoshi2, can I ask your help on something? The future of Pikipedia depends on you
2016-08-25 12:02:05	Yoshi2	sure
2016-08-25 12:02:15	Marty2000	Thank you
2016-08-25 12:02:18	Marty2000	So.. http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Impediment_Scourge&curid=826&diff=168607&oldid=167671
2016-08-25 12:02:25	Marty2000	Hindernisentferner
2016-08-25 12:02:32	Marty2000	Written "Hindernis-entferner" in-game.
2016-08-25 12:02:37	Marty2000	I put that as a note
2016-08-25 12:02:40	Marty2000	But
2016-08-25 12:03:07	Marty2000	I am sure that, normallyu, you would write "Hindernisentferner" if there were no line break
2016-08-25 12:03:11	Marty2000	Do you confirm?
2016-08-25 12:03:37	Marty2000	"I don't speak French, but should it not also be "Cataclysm of Impediments"" 
2016-08-25 12:03:59	Yoshi2	yes, if there was no line break, you would write it together
2016-08-25 12:04:03	Marty2000	No, otherwise the name would be different... "Cataclysme d'impédiments" 
2016-08-25 12:04:05	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-08-25 12:04:11	Marty2000	So, I'll revert the edit.
2016-08-25 12:08:35	Marty2000	I hate the character limit on the summary. :p
2016-08-25 12:09:05	Marty2000	I want to provide an explanation, but I'm limited on the number of characters I use. I'll have to shorten it...
2016-08-25 12:09:16	RandomYoshi	"Ask {{User|Yoshi2}} for an explanation if you want one."
2016-08-25 12:12:20	Klemen702	^^

2016-08-25 22:27:08	@Espyo	went to play beach volleyball after work
2016-08-25 22:27:17	Yoshi2	ah, nice
2016-08-25 22:29:07	Yoshi2	today me and a friend took a big step towards solving the mystery of the fake developer
2016-08-25 22:29:20	Yoshi2	or at least taking care of him
2016-08-25 22:30:14	@Espyo	hah
2016-08-25 22:30:17	@Espyo	still not done with that?
2016-08-25 22:30:20	@Espyo	well, what's the zinger?
2016-08-25 22:30:20	Yoshi2	we collected 3 of the weird claims he made and sent those to a guy we know was a developer on the game
2016-08-25 22:30:31	Yoshi2	with some luck, that one will reply
2016-08-25 22:31:05	@Espyo	oh nice
2016-08-25 22:35:22	Yoshi2	I wrote some person I thought the fake dev was related to, but the answers were not what I expected, so hopefully this will get us some good info
2016-08-25 22:36:21	@Espyo	hm, right

2016-08-26 18:48:55	Yoshi2	hi Espyo & Testyo 
2016-08-26 18:48:55	Testyo	lots of success, but isn't it?
2016-08-26 18:49:09	Yoshi2	I was confused for a bit because tab complete didn't work because you left quickly
2016-08-26 18:49:16	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-26 18:49:25	@Espyo	my mouse wasn't working
2016-08-26 18:49:28	@Espyo	figured it needed a cheeky reboot
2016-08-26 18:49:37	@Espyo	...turns out my sister taped an image on the mouse sensor
2016-08-26 18:50:52	Yoshi2	my sister would never do that
2016-08-26 18:51:25	Yoshi2	she would just take away the mouse and pressure me into playing with her
2016-08-26 18:52:05	@Espyo	hmm
2016-08-26 18:52:07	@Espyo	not sure if worse
2016-08-26 18:54:46	Yoshi2	I am currently looking into doing something with perlin noise
2016-08-26 18:58:04	@J	to solve the sister issue?
2016-08-26 19:00:28	Yoshi2	J: good job appearing at such a time to interpret the situation in such a way
2016-08-26 19:01:03	@J	I try my best
2016-08-26 19:01:27	Yoshi2	I am fairly positive that perlin noise cannot be used to solve issues with sisters
2016-08-26 19:01:42	Yoshi2	though if you do know a way to combine the two, I am all ears
2016-08-26 19:02:16	@J	play it as audio at a high frequency?
2016-08-26 19:02:38	Yoshi2	i thought more about using it to generate terrain
2016-08-26 19:04:30	@J	what for?
2016-08-26 19:05:35	Yoshi2	maybe it will have use for custom battalion wars levels

2016-08-26 19:16:08	Yoshi2	I did it, I made a 2d opensimplex noise image
2016-08-26 19:16:20	Yoshi2	... additionally, this is absolutely useless for what I wanted :|
2016-08-26 19:22:44	Yoshi2	people say minecraft uses perlin noise, but HOW
2016-08-26 19:39:43	@J	probably not just 'make some noise, there's your map'
2016-08-26 19:40:06	@J	but running the algorithm, or variants, multiple times with different sets of parameters to give different parts of the map
2016-08-26 19:40:28	@J	and then some tweaks, there's always tweaks
2016-08-26 19:43:05	@J	like you might run a low-detail version, then run a high-detail version, then merge them with the high-detail one adding just small variants to the low-detail one, if that makes sense
2016-08-26 19:43:31	@J	probably not
2016-08-26 19:43:40	@J	and also just an example of random stuff I might try
2016-08-26 20:17:13	Yoshi2	it feels like I have to use interpolate map data from this noise somehow
2016-08-26 20:17:35	Yoshi2	otherwise, the noise is too extreme

2016-08-26 21:00:33	Yoshi2	this actually PISSES me off
2016-08-26 21:00:52	Yoshi2	lots of talk about how perlin noise is supposed to be flawed and simplex/opensimplex is supposed to be better
2016-08-26 21:01:13	Yoshi2	but without a way to make it into something decent, that superiority is useless
2016-08-26 21:03:09	@Espyo	ugh, I get what you mean
2016-08-26 21:10:45	Yoshi2	ok apparently I need to do linear interpolation
2016-08-26 21:10:49	Yoshi2	how do i do it
2016-08-26 21:10:49	Yoshi2	help
2016-08-26 21:11:52	Yoshi2	bilinear interpolation
2016-08-26 21:13:11	Yoshi2	i feel like a helpless child right now
2016-08-26 21:18:20	Yoshi2	when in doubt, just google it
2016-08-26 21:20:15	@Espyo	well, linear interpolation is just (a/b) * c, right?
2016-08-26 21:24:07	Yoshi2	a*(1-c) + b*c
2016-08-26 21:24:57	Yoshi2	numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: no lapack/blas resources found COME ON
2016-08-26 21:25:19	Yoshi2	why can't, for once, installing this not be a pain in the ass
2016-08-26 21:31:23	@Espyo	that's why I just do EVERYTHING in Allegro, since I'm used to it
2016-08-26 21:31:34	@Espyo	the overhead of having to install and configure crap is not worth it
2016-08-26 21:31:41	@Espyo	...even if it'd make my life fifty times easier
2016-08-26 21:35:25	Yoshi2	there is something that feels so wrong about downloading a 65 MB lib just to do bilinear interpolation
2016-08-26 21:36:58	@Espyo	...
2016-08-26 21:37:01	@Espyo	insanely wrong, let me tell you
2016-08-26 21:37:32	Yoshi2	damn you scipy for being so
2016-08-26 21:37:34	Yoshi2	FAT
2016-08-26 21:39:31	Yoshi2	........ and these windows binaries can't find my python installation
2016-08-26 21:39:33	Yoshi2	WHAT
2016-08-26 21:39:35	Yoshi2	just WHAT
2016-08-26 21:39:51	Yoshi2	WHY CAN'T I PUT IN THE PATH MYSELF
2016-08-26 21:39:53	Yoshi2	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
2016-08-26 21:41:05	Yoshi2	sanity = -Inf
2016-08-26 21:41:54	@Espyo	yep
2016-08-26 21:44:40	Yoshi2	why is this installer checking for python in the registry
2016-08-26 21:44:57	Yoshi2	ughhhhhhh
2016-08-26 21:47:28	Yoshi2	anybody who wants to experience what stabbing yourself in the foot over and over again feels like should do python package installation in windows
2016-08-26 21:47:35	Yoshi2	it's some sick stuff
2016-08-26 21:48:47	@Espyo	wait, are you using pip for this?
2016-08-26 21:48:49	@Espyo	CAN you use pip?
2016-08-26 21:48:58	@Espyo	forgot you know more about Python than I do
2016-08-26 21:49:02	@Espyo	probably a stupid question
2016-08-26 21:49:03	@Espyo	sorry
2016-08-26 21:49:42	Yoshi2	I >can< use pip
2016-08-26 21:50:14	Yoshi2	but it will complain about scipy needing some additional stuff
2016-08-26 21:50:31	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-26 21:50:57	Yoshi2	somebody made a .whl that I'm supposed to be able to just install
2016-08-26 21:51:02	Yoshi2	and THAt one doesn't work either
2016-08-26 21:52:57	@Espyo	all right, bit of news
2016-08-26 21:53:02	@Espyo	I'm going on vacation tomorrow
2016-08-26 21:53:09	@Espyo	I can't remember if I said it here already
2016-08-26 21:53:18	Yoshi2	you haven't
2016-08-26 21:53:22	@Espyo	looks like I'll be able to connect to the internet, so I'll drop by every once in a while
2016-08-26 21:53:28	@Espyo	ugh, can't remember where I did and didn't say it
2016-08-26 21:56:54	 *	Yoshi2 sighs
2016-08-26 21:57:00	Yoshi2	time to implement this myself
2016-08-26 21:57:05	@Espyo	might as well...
2016-08-26 21:57:13	@Espyo	even if it ends up being just as much work
2016-08-26 21:57:15	@Espyo	at least you did it yourself
2016-08-26 22:08:53	Yoshi2	on a different note, this high quality rip is nice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc4MHZ_3AfY
2016-08-26 22:20:35	@Espyo	hm, dunno the original
2016-08-26 22:20:37	@Espyo	dunno the joke either
2016-08-26 22:26:53	Yoshi2	the joke is that it's a good piece to listen to
2016-08-26 22:26:58	Yoshi2	not everything has to be a joke
2016-08-26 22:27:23	Yoshi2	well, maybe there is a joke but I think it sounds nice
2016-08-26 22:27:29	Yoshi2	I never heard the original either
2016-08-26 22:32:46	Yoshi2	...
2016-08-26 22:32:50	Yoshi2	why
2016-08-26 22:32:53	Yoshi2	is this working
2016-08-26 22:32:57	Yoshi2	WHY IS THIS WORKING
2016-08-26 22:33:27	Yoshi2	https://i.imgur.com/OJnvCS6.png
2016-08-26 22:33:37	Yoshi2	64x64 blurred up to 256x256
2016-08-26 22:34:24	Yoshi2	there is a black border at the edge because I am not sure how to interpolate the edges
2016-08-26 22:35:53	Yoshi2	I think I need to wrap around for that
2016-08-26 22:39:13	Yoshi2	edges taken care of https://i.imgur.com/VGOadIA.png
2016-08-26 22:39:41	Yoshi2	I can't believe it, implementing bilinear interpolation took less time than getting scipy to work
2016-08-26 22:39:47	Yoshi2	and I still didn't get scipy to work

2016-08-28 13:12:43	@Espyo	right
2016-08-28 13:14:05	Yoshi2	first I messed up the formula, then I messed up the usage of the formula, then I figured out how to do it in 2d but in 3d I messed up the order which resulted in a messed up result

2016-08-28 13:28:13	Yoshi2	and a bit about bicubic: http://entropymine.com/imageworsener/bicubic/ (this page writes about how you can make families of cubic interpolation algorithms, although some are more common/neater than others)
2016-08-28 13:29:57	Yoshi2	and another thing to keep in mind
2016-08-28 13:30:16	Yoshi2	while bicubic needs 16 pixels (4x4 field), you are only filling data between the middle 4 pixels
2016-08-28 13:30:26	Yoshi2	the rest is for slopes and continuity at the edges
2016-08-28 13:30:35	@Espyo	neat
2016-08-28 13:31:09	Yoshi2	don't make the mistake I did where I tried to interpolate 4x4 pixels at a time, that won't work :P
2016-08-28 13:33:19	@Espyo	oh
2016-08-28 13:35:07	Yoshi2	2x2 (or rather the area between them), though you do need to take into account the 12 pixels around them

2016-08-28 16:19:44	@J	[13:10:24] Yoshi2 bicubic interpolation is a bitch and a half to do
2016-08-28 16:20:09	@J	looks a bit too...I don't know, crazy vertical hills?
2016-08-28 16:20:37	@J	maybe try running the height of each point through a function that decreases lower values more than higher values
2016-08-28 16:20:44	@J	square root or log or something
2016-08-28 16:21:16	@J	I guess this is the fun part, now you have the basic idea, put in random tweaks to see what fun stuff you can end up with
2016-08-28 16:22:14	@J	like, generate another map with much lower frequency and multiply it by this one on a large scale, and you should get something like biomes
2016-08-28 16:25:05	Yoshi2	log is a bad idea, makes everything small on the scale I am using it (though I no longer have crazy hills going on, so that is not an issue anymore)
2016-08-28 16:27:00	Yoshi2	but yes, now comes the fun part where I try to get something good out of it by experimenting
2016-08-28 16:29:27	Yoshi2	my code is sadly not very fast, so generating new maps takes a bit
2016-08-28 16:30:14	@J	well, sure, log then rescale, same thing
2016-08-28 16:30:58	@J	you should generate a map or two, save the numbers, then run quick transformations on those fixed maps
2016-08-28 16:31:04	@J	so the slow bit is done already
2016-08-28 16:33:03	@J	try using log with a lower base

2016-08-28 16:33:27	@J	log2 or even lower
2016-08-28 16:33:50	Yoshi2	I currently have a main map that I made low scale variants of, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (higher umber = lower scale)
2016-08-28 16:33:57	Yoshi2	and a biome map with the same thing
2016-08-28 16:35:37	Yoshi2	not sure how many of those I will need
2016-08-28 16:36:39	@J	I wonder how you can make overhangs
2016-08-28 16:37:06	@J	and flat hilltops
2016-08-28 16:37:24	Yoshi2	overhangs are not possible with the format
2016-08-28 16:37:32	Yoshi2	flat hilltops though, hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-08-28 16:39:09	Yoshi2	first, I need good hills before I can start caring about flat hilltops
2016-08-28 16:41:51	@J	I know, just wondering out loud
2016-08-28 16:45:00	@J	for overhangs, since you want them to be rare, maybe generate a 3D map afterwards, take regions where the value is above some high threshold, and remove those bits
2016-08-28 16:45:08	@J	it would make craters too
2016-08-28 16:45:23	@J	of course it means needing the thing to work in 3D
2016-08-28 16:46:27	Yoshi2	overhangs are technically impossible in battalion wars because the terrain is a 2d height map (from which the 3d terrain is made)

2016-08-30 07:10:10	Yoshi2	"how many people will be up if the pikcast starts in an hour?"

2016-08-30 07:21:50	Marty2000	I see...
2016-08-30 07:23:27	Yoshi2	Marty2000: are you even online on the pikipedia discord, the pikcast announcement should be in the mentions
2016-08-30 07:23:38	Marty2000	I'll start Discord
2016-08-30 07:23:46	Marty2000	I only connect to check the messages, most of the time
2016-08-30 07:25:00	Yoshi2	it was at 3 AM, you could've taken part in the pikcast if you weren't offline :I
2016-08-30 07:26:54	Marty2000	Me? Ha ha, no, my French accent would be a big problem :p
2016-08-30 07:27:55	Marty2000	Although... I did speak English recently with PikFan and some others, on a Skype call. But I need to practice before joining a Pikcast...
2016-08-30 07:28:19	Marty2000	What channel did he say that in, Yoshi2?
2016-08-30 07:28:28	Marty2000	#general?
2016-08-30 07:28:50	Yoshi2	#general, but you should find the mention if you click on the @ in the upper right corner
2016-08-30 07:29:21	Marty2000	Yep, thanks
2016-08-30 07:30:13	Marty2000	"There's Marty, the French guy who doesn't speak much English" He he
2016-08-30 07:30:34	Marty2000	I don't think I would have been invited to join it, anyway
2016-08-30 07:30:43	Marty2000	I'm still new to all of this...
2016-08-30 07:32:38	Yoshi2	you need more p r a c t i c e

2016-08-30 07:41:10	Yoshi2	if I'm fine with my mixture of a German/Russian (although probably closer to German) accent, you will be fine too ;)
2016-08-30 07:42:38	Marty2000	I wonder how English is taught in Germany
2016-08-30 07:42:45	Marty2000	It cannot be as horrible as in France
2016-08-30 07:43:46	Yoshi2	starting in elementary school or so, and until you finish 12th grade
2016-08-30 07:44:25	Marty2000	http://www.thelocal.fr/20141113/so-why-are-the-french-so-bad-at-english
2016-08-30 07:47:57	Yoshi2	""Another problem is that in France we are very protective of our language. We are very good at doing that, and people are actually still more concerned with whether we are speaking good French than good English. Our priorities have not changed, and therefore we have not seen a change in English speaking levels in the last four or five years.[...]"
2016-08-30 07:48:00	Yoshi2	RIP

2016-08-30 07:49:40	Yoshi2	I know a french guy who has good English skills and even plans to learn yet another language
2016-08-30 07:49:47	Yoshi2	do you want to hook up with him? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
2016-08-30 07:50:46	Marty2000	Hmmm... why not ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) But I'm busy right now
2016-08-30 07:52:05	Yoshi2	it's early in the morning, what could you possibly be busy with? :p

2016-08-30 10:06:43	Yoshi2	apparently there was a pikcast out of the blue at 3 am recently
2016-08-30 10:06:52	@PikFan	yeah
2016-08-30 10:07:02	@PikFan	I knew that it was going to happen
2016-08-30 10:07:08	@PikFan	but nobody told me
2016-08-30 10:07:35	@PikFan	nobody told me what day, I mean
2016-08-30 10:07:46	@PikFan	and now ShadowRaptor101 is all pissy
2016-08-30 10:07:56	@PikFan	he's like "why the fuck do I even tell people"
2016-08-30 10:07:58	@PikFan	listen here
2016-08-30 10:08:03	@PikFan	you never told me a DATE
2016-08-30 10:08:18	@PikFan	I knew it was going to happen
2016-08-30 10:08:26	@PikFan	but you didn't tell me a DATE
2016-08-30 10:08:46	@PikFan	but of course he completely ignores what I said and assumes I didn't listen
2016-08-30 10:09:01	@PikFan	tbh, I don't have a very high opinion of ShadowRaptor101
2016-08-30 10:09:16	@PikFan	he's extremely critical and shuts down anyone who disagrees with him
2016-08-30 10:09:25	@PikFan	*cough*NX*cough*
2016-08-30 10:09:56	Yoshi2	he is pretty ughhhhhh
2016-08-30 10:10:20	Yoshi2	doesn't inspire much confidence in me to have pikminfanon as a channel in the pikipedia discord :I
2016-08-30 10:10:39	@PikFan	same
2016-08-30 10:10:50	@PikFan	especially if he's going to bully around the new members
2016-08-30 10:11:01	@PikFan	he only likes Scruffy cause of his renders and musical creations
2016-08-30 10:11:13	@PikFan	as for the rest of us, he doesn't care
2016-08-30 10:11:18	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me
2016-08-30 10:11:24	@PikFan	he probably considers me annoying
2016-08-30 10:11:33	@PikFan	since he uses "autistic" as an insult :|
2016-08-30 10:11:52	Yoshi2	|:
2016-08-30 10:12:12	@PikFan	like, I'm fine with people using "retarded" as an insult
2016-08-30 10:12:24	@PikFan	because you don't think of a person who's mentally disabled
2016-08-30 10:12:31	@PikFan	at least, I don't
2016-08-30 10:13:23	@PikFan	but calling someone autistic is pretty degrading
2016-08-30 10:15:06	Yoshi2	it's certainly not something I want to see be thrown around as an insult
2016-08-30 10:15:18	@PikFan	yep
2016-08-30 10:15:32	@PikFan	I'll talk to Espyo about my concerns for ShadowRaptor101
2016-08-30 10:15:40	@PikFan	cause I don't want to face him myself
2016-08-30 10:15:50	@PikFan	if I do he'll just shut me up
2016-08-30 10:15:54	Yoshi2	heh
2016-08-30 10:16:25	@PikFan	imo, I think he thinks pretty highly of himself
2016-08-30 10:16:52	@PikFan	but he forgets that Espyo is the true leader of the community
2016-08-30 10:17:04	Yoshi2	at least he should handle the pikcast thing better :|
2016-08-30 10:17:05	@PikFan	without Espyo, we wouldn't be unified
2016-08-30 10:17:10	@PikFan	^^^^^^^^^
2016-08-30 10:17:48	@PikFan	well, maybe I can dm him and ask him about it
2016-08-30 10:18:30	@PikFan	just irritated that nobody told us a fixed date
2016-08-30 10:19:45	Yoshi2	he claimed he told everybody 3 weeks ago but bitch pls, unless you mentioned a fixed date telling 3 weeks in advance is pointless
2016-08-30 10:20:41	@PikFan	no kidding
2016-08-30 10:21:38	Yoshi2	if you mention a fixed date you can still say something like "if you don't/can't come tough luck" if you REALLY want to stroke your ego
2016-08-30 10:21:43	Yoshi2	but at least tell a fixed date
2016-08-30 10:22:42	Yoshi2	101 of common sense
2016-08-30 10:23:07	@PikFan	I'll be extremely pissed if he told everyone but us a fixed date
2016-08-30 10:23:16	@PikFan	like come on now, why would you do that?
2016-08-30 10:23:55	Yoshi2	there was at least one other person complaing about him not having told in advance, so I guess he didn't tell everyone (or not at all)
2016-08-30 10:24:43	@PikFan	I did say everyone but us :P
2016-08-30 10:25:47	@PikFan	[5:41 AM] ShadowRaptor101: "Thanks for letting me know in advance there would be a Pikcast"
2016-08-30 10:25:50	@PikFan	he misquoted me
2016-08-30 10:26:00	@PikFan	I said "thanks for the LACK of advance notice"
2016-08-30 10:26:17	Yoshi2	oh was it you?
2016-08-30 10:26:21	@PikFan	and I was saying it sarcastically cause I put a lenny at the end
2016-08-30 10:26:56	@PikFan	I want someone else to lead the PikCasts
2016-08-30 10:27:07	@PikFan	he is too abrasive and too ornery
2016-08-30 10:29:10	@PikFan	anyway, I gotta get going, it's 2:29 am for me, and I have to wake up in less than 6 hours

2016-08-30 12:48:23	@Espyo	I'll try PM
2016-08-30 12:48:25	@Espyo	thanks
2016-08-30 12:49:17	Yoshi2	me and pikfan were venting here about how the recent pikcast had no fixed date
2016-08-30 12:49:50	Yoshi2	shadow was like "in one hour there will be a pikcast, who will be up"
2016-08-30 12:50:01	@Espyo	pfft
2016-08-30 12:50:03	@Espyo	that's all the time
2016-08-30 12:51:10	@Espyo	he's just "Jake" on Discord, right?
2016-08-30 12:52:04	Yoshi2	think so, don't remember exactly
2016-08-30 12:52:05	Marty2000	Hi Espyo and ... Espyo
2016-08-30 12:52:38	Marty2000	Yes, he's Jake
2016-08-30 12:52:50	@Espyo	heh
2016-08-30 12:52:52	@Espyo	hi
2016-08-30 12:52:55	@Espyo	all right, thanks
2016-08-30 12:52:57	Marty2000	Do you need to always talk during Pikcasts?
2016-08-30 12:53:14	Marty2000	Or can you just join and listen?
2016-08-30 12:53:43	Yoshi2	the biggest obstacle is being awake at 3 in the fucking morning
2016-08-30 12:54:08	Yoshi2	which is no problem for marty but an issue for people in Europe with normal sleeping schedules :>
2016-08-30 12:54:17	@Espyo	I think you can just join and listen
2016-08-30 12:54:24	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-08-30 12:54:28	Marty2000	Okay, thanks
2016-08-30 12:55:09	Yoshi2	without a fixed date, that makes the pikcast a NA only thing :/
2016-08-30 12:55:15	@Espyo	yeah
2016-08-30 12:55:19	@Espyo	it's always been that way
2016-08-30 12:55:24	@Espyo	remember, they never really had to think much of it
2016-08-30 12:55:32	@Espyo	it was only a thing between friends and all
2016-08-30 12:56:55	Marty2000	I see
2016-08-30 12:57:16	@Espyo	gonna go catch some sun now

2016-08-30 12:57:22	Yoshi2	at this pace, pikminfanon might keep the discord separate from pikipedia
2016-08-30 12:57:27	Marty2000	See you
2016-08-30 12:57:30	Yoshi2	rip
2016-08-30 12:57:52	Marty2000	I don't think I've joined the Fanon group, though
2016-08-30 12:58:07	Yoshi2	wow
2016-08-30 12:58:08	Marty2000	Sun, something I'm afraid of :p
2016-08-30 12:58:11	Yoshi2	we need to change that
2016-08-30 12:58:28	Marty2000	I'm not active on Pikmin Fanon, though
2016-08-30 12:58:36	Marty2000	But I don't think it's a big problem... is it?
2016-08-30 12:58:43	Yoshi2	I sent you an invite on discord
2016-08-30 12:58:49	Marty2000	Yep, saw that
2016-08-30 12:58:50	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-08-30 12:59:04	Yoshi2	shouldn't be a big problem, I'm in it too :P
2016-08-30 12:59:17	Marty2000	He he
2016-08-30 13:01:17	Marty2000	So, there has always been American people only in Pikcasts... you, Espyo, and me need to change that ASAP
2016-08-30 13:01:36	Yoshi2	yup
2016-08-30 13:03:27	Marty2000	All the best stuff happens there, no fun :( I wish I had been able to join the Bingo Battle tournament a few months ago
2016-08-30 13:04:22	Yoshi2	how does that even work, pikmin 3 has no online
2016-08-30 13:04:35	Marty2000	They met... didn't they?
2016-08-30 13:05:06	Yoshi2	maybe
2016-08-30 13:07:16	Yoshi2	if you are unable to get enough of me, I finished a new video on custom BW terrain today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-buNZqG3zKQ
2016-08-30 13:07:46	Marty2000	Going to watch it
2016-08-30 13:15:16	Marty2000	Wow, the physics are so weird
2016-08-30 13:15:24	Marty2000	But it looks nice
2016-08-30 13:17:35	Yoshi2	I'm really torn on the recon physics
2016-08-30 13:17:47	Yoshi2	on the one hand, it's kinda fun to be bouncing around like that
2016-08-30 13:18:00	Yoshi2	on the other hand, it's difficult to drive straight
2016-08-30 13:19:01	Marty2000	Yeah, I see what you mean

2016-09-01 13:37:09	@Espyo	well, dropbox has gone to complete shit
2016-09-01 13:37:34	@Espyo	they're removing the ability to display HTML pages you're hosting
2016-09-01 13:37:48	@Espyo	a breach that happened in 2012 is causing problems today
2016-09-01 13:38:13	@Espyo	for the past 4 months they haven't said what they changed in their changelog, they just have generic "improvements" messages
2016-09-01 13:38:31	@Espyo	some core features, like the ability to not synch certain files has been missing since day 1
2016-09-01 13:38:41	@Espyo	I need out
2016-09-01 13:38:52	@Espyo	anybody know any good alternatives?
2016-09-01 13:42:52	Yoshi2	wb Espyo 
2016-09-01 13:43:04	@Espyo	thanks
2016-09-01 13:43:31	Yoshi2	if you find good alternatives, be sure to tell me
2016-09-01 13:44:05	@Espyo	according to this website
2016-09-01 13:44:08	@Espyo	sync.com seems to be the best
2016-09-01 13:44:12	Marty2000	Welcome back
2016-09-01 13:44:18	@Espyo	it actually uses, you know, that weird thing called "encryption"?
2016-09-01 13:44:25	@Espyo	it's probably some condiment for the dropbox people
2016-09-01 13:44:34	@Espyo	they failed to realize it's actually something IMPORTANT to have in such a service
2016-09-01 13:44:45	@Espyo	looks like it allows everything dropbox does
2016-09-01 13:44:49	@Espyo	so I wondered "well, it's not free"
2016-09-01 13:44:57	Marty2000	I see
2016-09-01 13:44:58	@Espyo	but it looks like there IS a free plan, which does allow pretty much everything the same
2016-09-01 13:45:43	@Espyo	really?
2016-09-01 13:45:46	@Espyo	THOSE are its weaknesses?
2016-09-01 13:46:01	@Espyo	on the desktop client, sharing options are a bit limited (ok, that's a bit of a bummer, but not a deal-breaker)
2016-09-01 13:46:13	@Espyo	and the fact that you can't upload a folder in the web client
2016-09-01 13:46:18	@Espyo	although you... kinda aren't meant to
2016-09-01 13:46:30	@Espyo	you can't send folders as content to upload while using a browser
2016-09-01 13:46:37	@Espyo	you CAN upload several files at once
2016-09-01 13:46:40	@Espyo	like on dropbox
2016-09-01 13:46:43	@Espyo	so this isn't even a con
2016-09-01 13:46:47	@Espyo	wtf, this sounds too good to be true
2016-09-01 13:47:52	@Espyo	wait, I need to know if the desktop client works on Linux
2016-09-01 13:47:57	@Espyo	screenshots here show Mac, so I assume so
2016-09-01 13:48:29	@Espyo	a "backup vault"?
2016-09-01 13:48:32	@Espyo	that's great
2016-09-01 13:48:44	@Espyo	oh, I didn't say one thing
2016-09-01 13:48:47	@Espyo	you get FIVE GB
2016-09-01 13:48:51	@Espyo	instead of dropbox's 2
2016-09-01 13:49:00	@Espyo	oh, AND revision history
2016-09-01 13:49:05	@Espyo	ok, this sounds like dropbox except not bad
2016-09-01 13:49:14	Yoshi2	it's like
2016-09-01 13:49:19	Yoshi2	why the fuck is it so difficult
2016-09-01 13:49:24	Yoshi2	make a service that isn't shit
2016-09-01 13:49:56	@Espyo	preaching to the choir
2016-09-01 13:49:59	@Espyo	it enrages me so much
2016-09-01 13:50:02	@Espyo	every time I do something
2016-09-01 13:50:08	@Espyo	I make sure to have it as immaculate as possible
2016-09-01 13:50:12	@Espyo	look, the Splatoon thing I'm doing
2016-09-01 13:50:16	@Espyo	I could've released it before going on vacatio
2016-09-01 13:50:17	@Espyo	*n
2016-09-01 13:50:19	@Espyo	it'd work just as fine
2016-09-01 13:50:29	@Espyo	but I WANT to tweak it more, so it's not frustrating or confusing
2016-09-01 13:50:31	@Espyo	I actually CARE
2016-09-01 13:50:42	@Espyo	and it doesn't even matter because it's just a silly little game people will play for 10 minutes and drop forever
2016-09-01 13:50:45	@Espyo	this is a fucking service
2016-09-01 13:50:52	@Espyo	and they just shit on their user's faces
2016-09-01 13:51:24	@Espyo	I can understand that it's costly to implement encryption, pay employees for the ability to have good selective sync, etc.
2016-09-01 13:51:28	@Espyo	but there's much more than that
2016-09-01 13:51:41	@Espyo	I already started thinking this was super sketchy when they removed the changelog
2016-09-01 13:51:44	@Espyo	that has NO excuse
2016-09-01 13:51:48	Yoshi2	I'd love to kidnap a skype or dropbox dev and ask him what the hell is up with the service
2016-09-01 13:51:53	@Espyo	you can't do that WITHOUT being shady
2016-09-01 13:52:02	@Espyo	my thoughts exactly
2016-09-01 13:52:57	@Espyo	for windows, it's apparently simply a shit-show that nobody is ever allowed to refactor
2016-09-01 13:53:03	@Espyo	years of unrefactored code leads to a windows
2016-09-01 13:53:13	@Espyo	but skype and dropbox and youtube and all?
2016-09-01 13:53:17	@Espyo	I'm dying of curiosity
2016-09-01 13:53:30	@Espyo	the only thing burning brighter than my hatred for that is my curiosity about how they work
2016-09-01 13:54:05	@Espyo	how can they stay afloat when their business practice involves letting a team of wasps stuck in a tight room slam against a keyboard in the hopes of writing compilable code?

2016-09-01 14:04:37	@Espyo	I'll take a look
2016-09-01 14:04:43	@Espyo	I'm checking a blogpost that ranked them
2016-09-01 14:04:47	@Espyo	apparently there are a lot of alternatives
2016-09-01 14:04:59	@Espyo	sigh, now it's just a matter of choosing

2016-09-01 14:07:18	@Espyo	I'd pay 700k stabs on the producer's stomach, would that suffice?

2016-09-01 15:10:38	@Espyo	and even then the policy might not do anything about name capitalization
2016-09-01 15:10:46	@Espyo	since the creators can still want to stylize a name
2016-09-01 15:10:47	@Espyo	like "eBay"
2016-09-01 15:10:53	Wraith	what did they say regarding Pokemon?
2016-09-01 15:11:00	Wraith	Right, you are correct
2016-09-01 15:13:49	Yoshi2	some sort of trainer abilities and pokemon that are adapted to their environment appear in the game
2016-09-01 15:15:21	Wraith	Cool. They say anything about hyper training?
2016-09-01 15:18:21	Yoshi2	no idea
2016-09-01 15:18:35	@Espyo	oh, SMM3D doesn't have online
2016-09-01 15:19:25	Yoshi2	they will have the full direct read uploaded afterwards
2016-09-01 15:19:31	Yoshi2	so you can rewatch the start
2016-09-01 15:19:50	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-01 15:19:54	@Espyo	but most of it doesn't matter for me
2016-09-01 15:19:58	@Espyo	don't care about Pokémon
2016-09-01 15:20:08	@Espyo	they'll probably talk about DLC for like Fire Emblem Fates and Hyrule Warriors
2016-09-01 15:20:09	@Espyo	meh
2016-09-01 15:20:26	Yoshi2	they better add patting dlc
2016-09-01 15:20:57	Wraith	smm3d with no online????
2016-09-01 15:20:58	@Espyo	they can't have their localization dept. throw a hissy fit
2016-09-01 15:21:01	@Espyo	yeah, looks like it
2016-09-01 15:21:04	Wraith	what's the point?

2016-09-01 15:40:30	@Espyo	is its tentative name

2016-09-01 15:41:05	Marty2000	I watched the European direct, and it was "Pikmin on 3DS", here, I think

2016-09-01 15:42:26	Marty2000	Stuff

2016-09-01 15:43:57	Marty2000	Pikmin for Nintendo 3DS

2016-09-01 15:44:14	Klemen702	wait
2016-09-01 15:44:22	Klemen702	what if it's avaiable for 2DS too

2016-09-01 15:50:25	Klemen702	why is it over
2016-09-01 15:50:48	Waterpikmin	everything because pikmin 4 has finally been announced!
2016-09-01 15:50:57	Klemen702	it's not pikmin 4 lol
2016-09-01 15:51:13	Klemen702	it had no 4
2016-09-01 15:51:20	Waterpikmin	thats what it seems like, it doesent even have a title yet
2016-09-01 15:51:29	Klemen702	that's the point
2016-09-01 15:51:35	Klemen702	it could be a spin-off
2016-09-01 15:51:45	Klemen702	so it's not as bad as what sticker star did to paper mario
2016-09-01 15:52:08	Waterpikmin	well either way, it looks absolutely great for something coming to the 3ds in 2017
2016-09-01 15:52:19	Klemen702	da
2016-09-01 15:52:25	Klemen702	too bad i can't play it :c
2016-09-01 15:52:28	Klemen702	ever maybe
2016-09-01 15:52:46	Waterpikmin	i thought it was a new chibi robo ziplash thing
2016-09-01 15:53:07	Waterpikmin	but i saw olimar and panicked
2016-09-01 15:53:17	Klemen702	maybe olimar is chibi robo in disguise
2016-09-01 15:53:22	Klemen702	they are both tiny
2016-09-01 15:54:05	Waterpikmin	please chibi robo went sticker star on us and i dont want our good friend olimar to go anywhere near that route
2016-09-01 15:54:21	Waterpikmin	it does seem like a spin off
2016-09-01 15:54:37	Waterpikmin	but then again story elements could be introduced later on like they did with pikmin 3
2016-09-01 15:54:38	Klemen702	my only complaint is the yellow bird creature
2016-09-01 15:54:55	Klemen702	i'd rather have an unoriginal electric bulborb
2016-09-01 15:55:04	Waterpikmin	yeah i dont really know where that came from
2016-09-01 15:55:29	Waterpikmin	but i think more mainstream enemies will make an appearance
2016-09-01 15:55:51	Waterpikmin	and how they attacked it was strange
2016-09-01 15:56:05	Waterpikmin	they were ground pounding it more than anything
2016-09-01 15:56:23	Waterpikmin	and it seems that treasure is a thing
2016-09-01 15:56:37	Waterpikmin	but i want one more thing for this game and that is multiplayer
2016-09-01 15:56:52	Marty2000	I have some images Espyo, I'll upload them to another site so you can choose the ones you think are worth adding
2016-09-01 15:57:04	Waterpikmin	since its a 2d game they can do much more with it
2016-09-01 15:57:26	Marty2000	I haven't given them precise names, though
2016-09-01 15:57:56	Klemen702	can we all see em
2016-09-01 15:58:16	Waterpikmin	the game comes out during 2017, so maybe something with NX could happen? but i dont like rumours so as of now its just the 3ds
2016-09-01 15:59:00	Waterpikmin	they have footage and i need to watch it over a bit more

2016-09-01 16:00:30	Klemen702	i have an idea and that would be making a complaint about a tiny detail becoming popular
2016-09-01 16:00:37	Klemen702	the new health bar of the enemies sucks
2016-09-01 16:00:49	Klemen702	rather have green circle

2016-09-01 16:01:02	Waterpikmin	Do you think other characters could appear? I see it more than likely.

2016-09-01 16:03:31	Waterpikmin	is  it me or does olimar have a jet pack?
2016-09-01 16:03:46	Klemen702	that's probably his backpack
2016-09-01 16:03:57	Waterpikmin	thats a cool upgrade

2016-09-01 16:05:23	Waterpikmin	guys
2016-09-01 16:05:28	Waterpikmin	i think its an onion
2016-09-01 16:05:35	Klemen702	where
2016-09-01 16:05:48	Waterpikmin	if you look at the footage of olimar right before the bulborb fight
2016-09-01 16:06:08	Waterpikmin	it looks like hes getting more pikmin
2016-09-01 16:06:48	Klemen702	we don't know what those things are
2016-09-01 16:07:13	Klemen702	they could be something for a mechanic similar to spiderworts if anything
2016-09-01 16:07:30	Waterpikmin	yeah that just seems really strange how they are carrying things to his backpack

2016-09-02 11:10:47	Yoshi2	I am very concerned, marty wasn't online last night
2016-09-02 11:11:21	@Espyo	hm, that is weird
2016-09-02 11:11:31	@Espyo	wasn't on Pikipedia either
2016-09-02 11:11:43	@Espyo	I didn't check thoroughly, but also not on Discorc
2016-09-02 11:11:44	@Espyo	*Discorc
2016-09-02 11:11:44	@Espyo	...
2016-09-02 11:11:45	@Espyo	screw it
2016-09-02 11:11:52	@Espyo	anyway, he might be busy, I guess
2016-09-02 11:12:08	Yoshi2	I am not sure what he would do so early in the morning
2016-09-02 11:15:39	@Espyo	Tabuu renamed a file
2016-09-02 11:15:41	@Espyo	can I ban him now?
2016-09-02 11:15:47	@Espyo	wait, I think I actually can
2016-09-02 11:15:58	@Espyo	if he didn't fix the pages that link to the old file, then...
2016-09-02 11:16:18	@Espyo	wait...
2016-09-02 11:16:32	@Espyo	HIS NEW FILE NAME IS STILL A MISSPELLING

2016-09-02 11:17:07	@Espyo	I don't know what to do
2016-09-02 11:22:59	Yoshi2	mhm, I heard marty talk about that a bit
2016-09-02 11:23:18	@Espyo	not surprised
2016-09-02 11:23:22	@Espyo	tabuu is always a hot topic
2016-09-02 11:31:17	Yoshi2	MY RAGE HAS THE POWER OF A THOUSAND SUNS
2016-09-02 11:31:23	Yoshi2	WHY CAN'T MY INTERNET BE STABLE
2016-09-02 11:32:09	Yoshi2	we recently had an ISP rep come here and I usually don't like reps but when my internet sucks THIS much literally any offer seems good
2016-09-02 11:32:25	@Espyo	nothing beats the nice, warm feeling of playing Splatoon, actually nailing it for once, then everybody stops moving, and "Your connection has been lost." appearing on-screen :)
2016-09-02 11:32:33	@Espyo	rep?
2016-09-02 11:32:36	@Espyo	replacement?
2016-09-02 11:32:36	@Espyo	representative?
2016-09-02 11:33:38	Yoshi2	a guy who wants to sell you one of their contracts
2016-09-02 11:36:13	@Espyo	ah
2016-09-02 11:36:13	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-09-02 11:36:13	@Espyo	thing is, they're all pieces of shit
2016-09-02 11:36:13	@Espyo	they all have faulty service
2016-09-02 11:36:13	@Espyo	if not faulty, slow
2016-09-02 11:36:13	@Espyo	if not slow, expensive
2016-09-02 11:36:14	@Espyo	if not expensive, faulty
2016-09-02 11:37:38	Yoshi2	I have enough faith that the service is NOT FUCKING DYING EVERY 2 MINUTES THEN COMING BACK WITH 10% OF THE SPEED I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
2016-09-02 11:37:59	Yoshi2	when I already have 6 MB max normally
2016-09-02 11:38:09	@Espyo	ouch
2016-09-02 11:39:43	Yoshi2	it can't be hard to provide better service than this non-functional piece of shit
2016-09-02 11:40:01	@Espyo	it's not
2016-09-02 11:40:11	@Espyo	but why would they when they can save up some money by not doing so?
2016-09-02 11:42:17	Yoshi2	then i will switch .-.
2016-09-02 11:42:32	@Espyo	or send complaints
2016-09-02 11:42:45	@Espyo	maybe it could legitimately be a fluke and they'll be happy (lol) to fix it
2016-09-02 11:44:15	Yoshi2	I've been complaining to my dad to get off his lazy ass and finally fix it for an eternity now .-.
2016-09-02 11:44:52	@Espyo	Complain Hard: Complain Harder
2016-09-02 11:53:53	Yoshi2	the only thing that annoys me more than the broken internet is some service's inability to recover from more than 30 seconds of broken connection
2016-09-02 11:54:14	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-09-02 12:12:35	@Espyo	har! the wikia still has no Pikmin 3DS info!

2016-09-03 15:12:54	Yoshi2	actually
2016-09-03 15:13:25	Yoshi2	Marty2000: let's beat up UltraMario for never responding to my pings in #pikipedia <_<
2016-09-03 15:20:33	Marty2000	UltraMario: let's beat up Yoshi2 for taking advantage of us >_>
2016-09-03 15:20:52	Yoshi2	pfffff
2016-09-03 15:20:55	Yoshi2	backstabber
2016-09-03 15:21:04	Yoshi2	i will just beat up both of you myself
2016-09-03 15:21:29	Marty2000	No, you cannot do anything on me ;)
2016-09-03 15:21:39	Marty2000	Let's pretend nothing happened
2016-09-03 15:22:06	Yoshi2	no
2016-09-03 15:22:28	Yoshi2	i will pretend I already beat up both of you and you are probably crying in the corner and holding your belly from the pain
2016-09-03 15:23:27	Yoshi2	:^)
2016-09-03 15:24:20	UltraMario	ohi

2016-09-03 15:24:35	Yoshi2	that works

2016-09-03 15:24:51	UltraMario	my b :p
2016-09-03 15:25:07	UltraMario	i dont have pikipedia set to beep on messages like my chat
2016-09-03 15:25:07	UltraMario	oops
2016-09-03 15:25:12	Yoshi2	Marty2000: see, UM picked the smart choice
2016-09-03 15:25:34	Yoshi2	odd, shouldn't it beep always when your name is mentioned?
2016-09-03 15:26:08	UltraMario	idk maybe
2016-09-03 15:26:28	UltraMario	i just have it set to beep for every mention because i like to torture myself :p
2016-09-03 15:26:32	UltraMario	er
2016-09-03 15:26:34	UltraMario	*message

2016-09-03 15:26:50	Yoshi2	you are very brave
2016-09-03 15:26:55	UltraMario	<3
2016-09-03 15:27:15	Yoshi2	but you don't have to set it up for every message :> It is enough if your client pings you when your name is mentioned
2016-09-03 15:27:27	UltraMario	true
2016-09-03 15:27:35	UltraMario	i just like going all out
2016-09-03 15:27:35	UltraMario	heh
2016-09-03 15:27:48	UltraMario	if i did it the other way it's easier to hear my custom sounds
2016-09-03 15:27:49	UltraMario	heh
2016-09-03 15:36:26	Yoshi2	UltraMario: btw in uniju's super secret channel it was "Talk Crap About People Who Aren't There To Defend Themselves" day
2016-09-03 15:36:42	UltraMario	ono
2016-09-03 15:36:47	UltraMario	did they talk shit about me
2016-09-03 15:38:14	Yoshi2	why else would I mention it to you? ;) ;) ;)
2016-09-03 15:38:21	UltraMario	;-;
2016-09-03 15:38:22	Yoshi2	jk it was nothing mean (I think)
2016-09-03 15:38:30	UltraMario	heh
2016-09-03 15:40:54	Marty2000	No sound for when my name is mentioned
2016-09-03 15:41:07	Marty2000	Probably because I'm using Mibbit on Pikipedia
2016-09-03 15:41:26	Yoshi2	you should use a REAL client like me and UM
2016-09-03 15:41:40	Yoshi2	UltraMario: do you want the logs of what was said about you? :o
2016-09-03 15:42:09	UltraMario	i gueeeeess
2016-09-03 15:42:09	UltraMario	:p
2016-09-03 15:43:20	Marty2000	I will probably not use a real client
2016-09-03 15:46:35	UltraMario	wow
2016-09-03 15:46:36	UltraMario	w o w
2016-09-03 15:50:51	Yoshi2	you are just saying that to rile me up
2016-09-03 15:54:46	Marty2000	I like to be annoying sometimes.
2016-09-03 16:05:52	UltraMario	you always do

2016-09-04 12:48:03	@Espyo	and your uploads randomly have the final template call "description" as one of the fields instead of "summary"
2016-09-04 12:48:09	@Espyo	...which makes it have no summary on that little table thing
2016-09-04 12:48:12	@Espyo	I fixed this ages ago
2016-09-04 12:48:22	@Espyo	but I guess your browser sometimes uses older versions of the script
2016-09-04 12:48:35	Marty2000	I think so
2016-09-04 12:48:41	@Espyo	hopefully this "force refresh" thing with the ctrl+f5 or shift+f5 will have forced it to use this version of the script from here on out
2016-09-04 12:48:49	@Espyo	see, on Firefox, it's simply ctrl+f5
2016-09-04 12:48:54	Marty2000	Also, often, I get the old version with "Summary" instead of "Description"
2016-09-04 12:48:54	@Espyo	on Chrome, it's nonsense
2016-09-04 12:48:57	@Espyo	nobody really knows how
2016-09-04 12:49:03	Marty2000	Heh
2016-09-04 12:49:07	@Espyo	most people just say "just mash f5 until it happens" :|
2016-09-04 12:49:12	@Espyo	yeah, that happened to me too sometimes
2016-09-04 12:49:21	@Espyo	but I think I managed to fix that some days ago
2016-09-04 12:49:23	@Espyo	here's hoping...
2016-09-04 12:49:26	@Espyo	and hi, Yoshi2
2016-09-04 12:49:39	Marty2000	For me, it almost always happens when 
2016-09-04 12:49:43	Marty2000	I upload an image
2016-09-04 12:49:53	Marty2000	and right after, I click on "Upload file" again
2016-09-04 12:50:02	Marty2000	I have to refresh a few times to get back to normal
2016-09-04 12:50:05	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-09-04 12:50:13	@Espyo	scripts on wikis are normally very janky
2016-09-04 12:50:15	@Espyo	it's sad :/
2016-09-04 12:50:25	Marty2000	I see
2016-09-04 12:51:06	Yoshi2	Espyo: it was very mean of you to say "brb" and then disappearing until today :<
2016-09-04 12:52:28	@Espyo	but
2016-09-04 12:52:30	@Espyo	I was around yesterday
2016-09-04 12:52:52	@Espyo	comparing it to the lifespan of the universe, that was a pretty short brb :V
2016-09-04 12:52:54	Yoshi2	s/today/evening yesterday
2016-09-04 12:52:59	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-09-04 12:53:04	Yoshi2	Sep 02 18:59:32 <Wraith>	and why I (thought) I bought the Wii
2016-09-04 12:53:05	Yoshi2	Sep 02 18:59:50 <Espyo>	same

2016-09-04 12:54:41	Yoshi2	Marty2000: that is minuscule compared to misusing "brb" :P
2016-09-04 12:54:46	@Espyo	D:
2016-09-04 12:54:57	Marty2000	Okay okay
2016-09-04 12:55:09	Marty2000	If I'm allowed to, I'll troll you as much as I troll people on Skype.
2016-09-04 12:55:23	Marty2000	Am I allowed to? :p
2016-09-04 12:55:43	Yoshi2	(I've seen too many people misuse "brb" in the past so it is something I take seriously :P )
2016-09-04 12:56:13	Yoshi2	Marty2000: i only accept high quality trolling
2016-09-04 12:56:39	Marty2000	I am asking the OPs, I don't mind about what you think ;)
2016-09-04 12:56:58	Marty2000	I want to know if I can be rude to him as well
2016-09-04 12:58:46	@Espyo	well, sure
2016-09-04 12:59:49	Marty2000	Thanks. Now that I can, nothing will stop me

2016-09-04 13:03:16	WikiGuest73	thanks
2016-09-04 13:04:00	Marty2000	Yes, it is true since Nintendo themselves revealed it ;)
2016-09-04 13:06:32	WikiGuest73	i haven't a 3DS, do u think there will possible to play on WII U? by the store?
2016-09-04 13:06:55	Marty2000	I don't know, probably not.
2016-09-04 13:06:56	@Espyo	I doubt it
2016-09-04 13:07:02	@Espyo	looks like a 3DS-exclusive
2016-09-04 13:10:14	WikiGuest73	there no information, is a new pikmin? (pikmin 4) or Pikmin  for 3ds?
2016-09-04 13:10:33	@Espyo	we're still not sure...
2016-09-04 13:11:00	@Espyo	nobody knows if this game is completely new, or if it's the "Pikmin 4" that was revealed years ago
2016-09-04 13:11:07	Marty2000	We don't know if Pikmin for 3DS is "Pikmin 4" or if they are different games.
2016-09-04 13:11:19	Marty2000	Yes, what Espyo said ;)

2016-09-04 13:12:19	Marty2000	I saw that Wikia had very little information on the game
2016-09-04 13:12:24	@Espyo	yep
2016-09-04 13:12:27	@Espyo	they only today made an article
2016-09-04 13:12:29	@Espyo	and it's trash
2016-09-04 13:12:31	@Espyo	har!
2016-09-04 13:13:56	Marty2000	Nice
2016-09-04 15:20:03	@Espyo	ok, the (working) name really IS "Pikmin for Nintendo 3DS"
2016-09-04 15:20:23	@Espyo	there's been debate whether it's just "Pikmin", just "PIKMIN", "PIKMIN for Nintendo 3DS", "Pikmin for 3DS", "Pikmin for Nintendo 3DS", etc.

2016-09-04 15:20:56	@Espyo	wikia got it wrong
2016-09-04 15:20:59	@Espyo	oh how unsurprising!
2016-09-04 15:21:08	@Espyo	what's more, there's no longer doubt in the air
2016-09-04 15:29:38	Yoshi2	good to know
2016-09-04 15:38:51	Marty2000	Let me check the French direct
2016-09-04 15:38:56	Marty2000	But yeah, good to know :p
2016-09-04 15:40:22	Marty2000	Almost the same as well

2016-09-04 16:30:30	@Espyo	nope
2016-09-04 16:30:36	@Espyo	"he helps Espyo on IRC" — your description
2016-09-04 16:30:45	@Espyo	well, besides all the BW things, that's it, I guess?
2016-09-04 16:31:54	Yoshi2	:( my nintendo modding efforts don't matter? :(
2016-09-04 16:32:13	@Espyo	you gotta make yourself better known on the Discord
2016-09-04 16:33:24	Yoshi2	I guess for the most part I am a support role but hnnnggg, my character isn't as flat as that
2016-09-04 16:33:40	@Espyo	sure isn't
2016-09-04 16:34:03	@Espyo	I wanted to make a joke with Paper Mario, Yoshi being in the Mario series, and your nickname
2016-09-04 16:34:04	@Espyo	but
2016-09-04 16:34:05	@Espyo	I've got nothing
2016-09-04 16:37:03	Yoshi2	"make yourself better known on the discord" is easier said than done, considering I only got in recently
2016-09-04 16:37:13	@Espyo	eh, don't worry much about it
2016-09-04 16:37:17	@Espyo	you've got my seal of approval
2016-09-04 16:37:24	@Espyo	you're not "Random Pikmin Fan #667234"
2016-09-04 16:37:29	Yoshi2	yaaay
2016-09-04 16:38:10	Marty2000	I consider myself more of a glitch hunter, in a certain sense :p
2016-09-04 16:38:20	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-04 16:38:27	Yoshi2	Marty2000 how did you become a pikipedia admin
2016-09-04 16:38:30	Marty2000	even though I've never wanted to find a glitch on purpose, to be honest 
2016-09-04 16:38:30	@Espyo	I...guess we don't really have roles
2016-09-04 16:38:33	@Espyo	we just do stuff we like
2016-09-04 16:38:37	Marty2000	I've never
2016-09-04 16:38:41	@Espyo	thing is, some of us specialize on some things more than others
2016-09-04 16:38:47	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-09-04 16:39:15	Marty2000	You solve the technical aspect of glitches, he he
2016-09-04 16:39:22	@Espyo	hehe, guess so
2016-09-04 16:43:13	Marty2000	Oh, seeing your edit on the Hermit Crawmad reminds me of a funny thing that I've never recorded because it's maybe not a glitch, but I'll say it here since it's funn enough
2016-09-04 16:43:29	@Espyo	oh, sure
2016-09-04 16:43:35	Marty2000	When a Hermit Crawmad is petrified, you can move them with a leader
2016-09-04 16:43:49	Marty2000	I managed to move one past the electric gate in the Wistful Wild,
2016-09-04 16:44:00	Marty2000	and when they got back, they climbed up a wall
2016-09-04 16:44:19	Marty2000	They were "above" the electric gate, it was quite funny
2016-09-04 16:44:25	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-04 16:44:28	Marty2000	I thought they'd be blocked by the wall, but nope
2016-09-04 16:44:31	@Espyo	it's so neat how they climb up stuff to get to where they want
2016-09-04 16:44:37	Marty2000	Indeed
2016-09-04 17:10:27	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e0MxJGiA
2016-09-04 17:11:20	Marty2000	Oh, yeah, neat
2016-09-04 17:11:22	Marty2000	I know where it is
2016-09-04 17:17:12	@Espyo	you do?
2016-09-04 17:20:51	Marty2000	It's in the arena with the Artic Shaggy Long Legs
2016-09-04 17:21:00	Marty2000	on the Distant Tundra
2016-09-04 17:21:10	@Espyo	how did that happen?
2016-09-04 17:21:42	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADV0aATl5Ddw
2016-09-04 17:21:46	Marty2000	Just got out of bounds
2016-09-04 17:21:53	Marty2000	Be right back
2016-09-04 17:22:50	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-09-04 17:22:54	@Espyo	think that's worth adding to the wiki?
2016-09-04 17:22:56	@Espyo	it looks really funky
2016-09-04 17:23:01	@Espyo	more than other out-of-boundsnesses
2016-09-04 17:24:19	Yoshi2	looks very fun
2016-09-04 17:24:26	Yoshi2	and the 2d background is very obvious
2016-09-04 17:27:39	Yoshi2	at the moment I have difficulty imagining that the pikipedia discord and pikminfanon discord could be merged in a way that would make everybody happy
2016-09-04 17:28:56	@Espyo	hmm
2016-09-04 17:47:38	Marty2000	Back
2016-09-04 17:47:55	Marty2000	Hmmm, if you think it's worth adding, I suppose we should add it
2016-09-04 17:47:59	Yoshi2	wb
2016-09-04 17:48:23	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-09-04 17:48:39	@Espyo	not sure...
2016-09-04 17:49:51	Marty2000	If we do, then I'd want to add information on all possible out of bounds :p
2016-09-04 17:50:25	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-09-04 17:50:29	@Espyo	might be worth looking into one day
2016-09-04 17:50:45	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e0KS9aFQ
2016-09-04 17:50:52	@Espyo	should we add this as a bit of trivia?
2016-09-04 17:51:10	@Espyo	like, the Data Glutton's hitbox vertically is larger than the phone itself
2016-09-04 17:51:10	Testyo	Espyo is flooding!
2016-09-04 17:51:19	@Espyo	and this can be seen by throwing a leader or Pikmin on top of it
2016-09-04 17:51:22	@Espyo	like hell I am
2016-09-04 17:51:52	Marty2000	Yeah, I think it's interesting
2016-09-04 17:51:57	Marty2000	Testyo is flooding!
2016-09-04 17:51:58	Testyo	maybe they bumped it as a way to remind people of the second move, you mean
2016-09-04 17:52:19	@Espyo	can you please check in-game if it's as simple as throwing a leader or Pikmin on top of it?
2016-09-04 17:52:25	@Espyo	might be worth checking other such objects too
2016-09-04 17:52:35	Yoshi2	I am a bit sad about how I can no longer get excited for such simple bugs
2016-09-04 17:53:13	Marty2000	Don't you mind if I do it tonight? I'm playing SPlatoon with some friends right now and then I'll go to sleep
2016-09-04 17:53:39	Marty2000	I'll make sure to write it down so I don't forget :p
2016-09-04 17:54:30	@Espyo	oh, not at all
2016-09-04 17:54:30	Testyo	Espyo is a flooder!

2016-09-04 17:54:45	Testyo	I can't remember what is it that I did with Wiimms SZS Tools to manipulate the szs files
2016-09-04 17:54:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-09-04 17:54:54	@Espyo	...what the fuck
2016-09-04 17:55:00	Yoshi2	doing lots of bug seeking in Ocarina of Time which had lots of gamebreaking bugs spoiled me
2016-09-04 17:55:06	Yoshi2	and then there is tasbot
2016-09-04 17:55:09	@Espyo	I LITERALLY just replied to BielR3 about Wiimm's SZS Tools
2016-09-04 17:55:09	Marty2000	What the Bubbler is happening with Testyo? He's being weirder than usual
2016-09-04 17:55:10	Testyo	I think I've seen my boss browse through that page some weeks ago
2016-09-04 17:55:21	@Espyo	and how I'm not entirely sure if that's what I use
2016-09-04 17:55:23	Marty2000	LOL
2016-09-04 17:55:25	@Espyo	I'm actually creeped out right now :/
2016-09-04 17:55:36	@Espyo	>hm, let's see
2016-09-04 17:55:37	@Espyo	it's a bit of mess to figure this out, because I have so many tools installed
2016-09-04 17:55:37	@Espyo	but I'm pretty sure that for Pikmin 2, I use Wiimm's SZS tools
2016-09-04 17:55:37	@Espyo	you have to run them through the command line
2016-09-04 17:55:37	Marty2000	Testyo's stalking a bit, is all
2016-09-04 17:55:38	Testyo	probably the same behavior as an Onion, really
2016-09-04 17:55:46	@Espyo	this kid surprises me sometimes...
2016-09-04 17:55:52	@Espyo	aaaanyway, yeah, I know what you mean, Yoshi2
2016-09-04 17:55:56	@Espyo	but still, it's like pizza
2016-09-04 17:55:59	@Espyo	when it's good, it's good
2016-09-04 17:56:04	@Espyo	when it's so-so, it's still good
2016-09-04 17:56:58	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e6FHo0Fg this one reminds me of the Twilight River geometry despawn glitch discovered some days ago
2016-09-04 17:57:31	Yoshi2	some games just aren't made for crazy bugs
2016-09-04 17:58:17	Yoshi2	I have trouble thinking of anything to try in battalion wars
2016-09-04 17:59:50	Yoshi2	no out of bounds things that would speed the levels up
2016-09-04 18:00:38	Marty2000	Oh, yeah, odd, Espyo
2016-09-04 18:00:46	@Espyo	good point
2016-09-04 18:00:55	@Espyo	I tried asking what that glitch is, let's see if I get a reply
2016-09-04 18:01:03	@Espyo	so, SO many posts that show glitches have no info... it's so sad
2016-09-04 18:01:31	@Espyo	this user again with the ambiguous "glitches"... https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e5p3TB5A
2016-09-04 18:01:52	Marty2000	I'll be honest, I don't see the glitch again, ha ha
2016-09-04 18:02:32	Marty2000	Hopefully you'll have an answer
2016-09-04 18:09:39	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e5nNzkKw here too
2016-09-04 18:11:05	Marty2000	I don't see it either
2016-09-04 18:11:18	Marty2000	So I'm going to ask
2016-09-04 18:11:25	@Espyo	no need
2016-09-04 18:11:28	@Espyo	it's probably nothing, as usual...
2016-09-04 18:11:58	Marty2000	Too late
2016-09-04 18:12:01	Marty2000	maybe
2016-09-04 18:15:32	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e5Ds9XEA IT'S BOLBERT
2016-09-04 18:15:35	@Espyo	it's back!
2016-09-04 18:17:27	Yoshi2	it is reaaaaaaaaaal
2016-09-04 18:18:31	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e5DOgrMg hm?
2016-09-04 18:18:42	@Espyo	best I can gather from this is that Pikmin holding bomb-rocks look weird if they crouch down while hiding
2016-09-04 18:19:16	Yoshi2	I guess
2016-09-04 18:19:25	Yoshi2	doesn't look like anything groundbreaking
2016-09-04 18:19:28	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-04 18:19:33	@Espyo	but that leaf is hiding a lot
2016-09-04 18:19:38	@Espyo	maybe the Pikmin's neck is all contorted
2016-09-04 18:19:39	@Espyo	look at its leaf
2016-09-04 18:19:45	@Espyo	it doesn't look natural
2016-09-04 18:19:49	@Espyo	wanna check that too, Marty?
2016-09-04 18:20:38	Marty2000	Sure
2016-09-04 18:22:47	Yoshi2	marty's role should've been written down as "Espyo's personal slave" tbh
2016-09-04 18:23:49	@Espyo	now now
2016-09-04 18:23:54	@Espyo	he can be a slave for other people too
2016-09-04 18:24:08	Yoshi2	good point

2016-09-04 18:24:33	Yoshi2	"the collective's servant"
2016-09-04 18:24:39	Yoshi2	the hero we need
2016-09-04 18:25:05	Yoshi2	hah
2016-09-04 18:26:55	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e1D8J9VA ok, I'm REALLY curious about this one
2016-09-04 18:28:22	Marty2000	I think I got it once when taking a pic' near an electric current
2016-09-04 18:28:31	Marty2000	But I'll retry as well :p
2016-09-04 18:32:09	@Espyo	thanks
2016-09-04 18:32:17	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e1S3bpzw casual exploit?
2016-09-04 18:33:30	Yoshi2	is there any spot where the wall is thin enough that the blob could glitch through?
2016-09-04 18:36:16	@Espyo	don't think so, no
2016-09-04 18:36:25	@Espyo	but there are a lot of spots where it just climbs over the wall to get to Olimar on the other side
2016-09-04 18:36:32	@Espyo	so if it's stuck here, that could be an exploit for casual players
2016-09-04 18:36:37	@Espyo	leave Olimar there, and let it get stuck
2016-09-04 18:37:19	Yoshi2	ah
2016-09-04 18:40:23	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-09-04 18:45:36	Yoshi2	[7:34 PM] ShadowRaptor101: Ain't gonna be home for a while but I got Discord mobile
2016-09-04 18:45:36	Yoshi2	[7:36 PM] ShadowRaptor101: I do want it to be portable but I am fine if it ends up not being
2016-09-04 18:45:37	Yoshi2	[7:36 PM] loo: espyo is dead again
2016-09-04 18:45:37	Yoshi2	[7:37 PM] ShadowRaptor101: LITERALLY 14 MINUTES

2016-09-04 20:10:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: so the pikipedia discord will stay exclusive? :v
2016-09-04 20:10:44	@Espyo	iunno
2016-09-04 20:22:27	Yoshi2	I think the way how that will be handled will decide how I see some of the skype/discord guys
2016-09-04 20:22:31	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User account Mamodxx created http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Mamodxx
2016-09-04 20:23:05	Yoshi2	having it stay some weird sort of exclusive clique is not exactly my idea of a community
2016-09-04 20:25:33	@Espyo	it kinda is, though
2016-09-04 20:28:49	Yoshi2	all the irc channels I'm in are mostly fine without being invite-limited
2016-09-04 20:29:17	@Espyo	I think the general idea is:
2016-09-04 20:29:23	@Espyo	that group of people started editing the wikia
2016-09-04 20:29:27	@Espyo	then they became friends
2016-09-04 20:29:33	@Espyo	and just had their own little skype group amongst friends
2016-09-04 20:29:43	@Espyo	when we talked for the merge, I got invited to that group
2016-09-04 20:29:52	@Espyo	it was just kinda nicknamed the Pikipedia skype group
2016-09-04 20:30:00	@Espyo	but it was really just that group of friends's hangout
2016-09-04 20:30:05	@Espyo	lots of personal talk goes in there
2016-09-04 20:30:13	@Espyo	so it's not really the place to have just anybody jump in
2016-09-04 20:30:30	@Espyo	but at the same time it kinda is? they're accepting new people and are kinda making it out like the official Pikipedia discord channel?
2016-09-04 20:30:32	@Espyo	it's a bit of a mess
2016-09-04 20:32:02	Yoshi2	so confusing
2016-09-04 20:32:52	Yoshi2	I guess it kinda works if people of note are invited to it
2016-09-04 20:33:01	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-04 20:33:32	@Espyo	hey, by the way
2016-09-04 20:33:38	@Espyo	did you ever try sync.com or pcloud?
2016-09-04 20:33:59	Yoshi2	i am a lazy piece of crap who already forgot about that
2016-09-04 20:34:06	@Espyo	noted
2016-09-04 20:34:09	@Espyo	I'll try it tomorrow
2016-09-04 20:34:13	@Espyo	...ish
2016-09-04 20:34:47	Yoshi2	(ok I am not lazy but the part with me having forgotten about it is true)
2016-09-04 20:35:02	Yoshi2	(ok i am lazy but not a piece of crap)
2016-09-04 20:35:24	@Espyo	(ok, you are a piece, just not of crap)
2016-09-04 20:36:50	Yoshi2	that works

2016-09-05 12:16:33	Yoshi2	scruffy is the closest to that but he has a lot of other things to do
2016-09-05 12:17:41	@Espyo	and I tried and then gave up

2016-09-05 15:49:51	Yoshi2	sure
2016-09-05 15:50:52	En_Passant	You're not an admin in the Discord, though
2016-09-05 15:51:20	Yoshi2	ask away and I'm sure espyo will get back to you
2016-09-05 15:52:03	En_Passant	Can you get people to stop shitposting in #general in Pikipedia discord
2016-09-05 15:52:22	En_Passant	It makes us look bad to anyone new that comes in
2016-09-05 15:53:03	En_Passant	Especially if Sushi's trying to merge with an apparently existing chat that has 50 people in it
2016-09-05 15:53:31	Yoshi2	there is another chat with 50 people in it? :o
2016-09-05 15:53:52	En_Passant	That's what he said in the speedrunning Discord
2016-09-05 15:57:20	Yoshi2	I do agree #general would profit from less shitposting (maybe a separate shitposting channel?)
2016-09-05 16:13:26	En_Passant	That was my original suggestion, but no one seemed to listen
2016-09-05 16:43:12	@Espyo	well
2016-09-05 16:43:14	@Espyo	here's the thing
2016-09-05 16:43:23	@Espyo	the current Pikipedia Discord is just a group of friends
2016-09-05 16:43:29	@Espyo	it's the people that used to be on the skype group
2016-09-05 16:43:40	@Espyo	which in turn, is the group of people who became friends by being editors of the Pikmin wikia
2016-09-05 16:43:59	@Espyo	its status between "group of friends" and "public chatroom for Pikmin fans" is VERY blurry
2016-09-05 16:44:05	@Espyo	and hopefully this merge will fix that
2016-09-05 16:44:08	@Espyo	the general idea will be
2016-09-05 16:44:22	@Espyo	Pikmin fans, of all kinds, will hang out on that popular Pikmin server
2016-09-05 16:44:49	@Espyo	the guys will stay on the current one, where they continue to shittalk and discuss about how their aunt has cancer
2016-09-05 16:45:01	@Espyo	but the guys will ALSO go to the other server, to discuss Pikmin
2016-09-05 16:45:04	@Espyo	everybody wins that way
2016-09-05 16:46:41	En_Passant	What do people on the popular server do when they want to shitpost?
2016-09-05 16:47:31	@Espyo	iunno
2016-09-05 16:47:33	@Espyo	I think they don't
2016-09-05 17:10:16	Yoshi2	if they REALLY wanted something probably could be arranged, but shitposting isn't everybody's thing

2016-09-05 19:14:54	@Espyo	this is the closest you can get to sharing a file with somebody else
2016-09-05 19:15:04	@Espyo	a blocky page full of ads, and no direct link to the file
2016-09-05 19:16:40	Yoshi2	that's shiiiiiit
2016-09-05 19:18:05	@Espyo	dunno what to think
2016-09-05 19:18:08	@Espyo	I can't just stay on dropbox
2016-09-05 19:18:13	@Espyo	but this is a major turn-off for me
2016-09-05 19:21:49	@Espyo	then there's a "sync" folder besides the other folders
2016-09-05 19:21:53	@Espyo	and I can't quite tell what its deal is
2016-09-05 19:26:34	@Espyo	oh, I think stuff in there is automatically downloaded and updated on other machines running pcloud
2016-09-05 19:26:43	@Espyo	whereas stuff NOT on there needs to be downloaded
2016-09-05 19:26:48	@Espyo	at least, I'm guessing that's the case with mobile?
2016-09-05 19:26:51	@Espyo	ugh, I'm not sure
2016-09-05 19:26:59	@Espyo	I wouldn't have to be doing this if it dropbox weren't so horrible
2016-09-05 19:27:01	@Espyo	hmm
2016-09-05 19:27:05	@Espyo	J: how is your cloud life going?
2016-09-05 20:03:17	@J	my what
2016-09-05 20:03:49	@Espyo	cloud storage
2016-09-05 20:03:59	@Espyo	do you use cloud storage at all?
2016-09-05 20:04:15	@J	guess it depends on your definition
2016-09-05 20:04:30	@J	I use CrashPlan for backups, and regular PHP web hosting for file sharing
2016-09-05 20:04:39	@Espyo	that's the answer I was looking for
2016-09-05 20:04:55	@Espyo	I'm starting to think I should invest in something similar
2016-09-05 20:05:05	@Espyo	if you haven't read what I wrote earlier, I'm trying alternatives to dropbox, since it's trash now
2016-09-05 20:05:08	@Espyo	and nothing really works that well
2016-09-05 20:05:18	@Espyo	dropbox was good both for storage, and for file sharing
2016-09-05 20:05:26	@J	CrashPlan is nice, quite flexible and useful for backups, my only complaint is the slow-ish interface
2016-09-05 20:05:42	@Espyo	hmm
2016-09-05 20:05:50	@Espyo	what about synching between computers?
2016-09-05 20:06:56	@J	I don't really bother
2016-09-05 20:07:04	@J	I only really use one computer regularly
2016-09-05 20:07:15	@J	while on holiday I can download stuff from the CrashPlan backup using the website
2016-09-05 20:07:33	@J	at home, on my laptop, I ssh into my desktop
2016-09-05 20:09:05	@Espyo	fair, though you need the desktop on
2016-09-05 20:09:23	@Espyo	so do you just have it on all the time?
2016-09-05 20:10:40	@J	when I'm at home and not sleeping, I guess
2016-09-05 20:10:56	@J	when I'm on holiday I leave my Raspberry Pi on, and I can use that to boot the desktop
2016-09-05 20:11:02	@Espyo	oh
2016-09-05 20:11:37	@Espyo	where do you host the website on? locally, or did you buy a domain?
2016-09-05 20:11:46	@Espyo	I mean, I guess you bought a domain, that ikn.co.uk or some such?
2016-09-05 20:12:08	@Espyo	but is that basically just pointing to your machine, running PHP?
2016-09-05 20:12:17	@J	no, I use Vidahost for that
2016-09-05 20:12:25	@J	pretty small plan, quite cheap
2016-09-05 20:12:34	@J	not a huge amount of storage
2016-09-05 20:12:45	@Espyo	hm, looks nice
2016-09-05 20:12:45	@J	like £50 for 3 years or something?
2016-09-05 20:12:54	@Espyo	hey, that IS pretty cheap
2016-09-05 20:13:22	@Espyo	I'll have to think about these options...
2016-09-05 20:13:22	@Espyo	thanks
2016-09-05 20:14:06	@J	for the domain I use Gandi
2016-09-05 20:14:58	@Espyo	"domain name registrar?"
2016-09-05 20:16:01	@J	yeah
2016-09-05 20:16:19	@Espyo	huh, TIL
2016-09-05 20:16:35	@J	of course if it's just for personal use you don't need a domain
2016-09-05 20:16:46	@Espyo	yeah

2016-09-05 21:08:00	Neocraftz1553	I was considering using Unreal Engine or Unity to make something like Gradius V

2016-09-07 13:14:05	Marty2000	And sorry for yesterday :p
2016-09-07 13:16:01	Marty2000	Anyway, I'm going to do some Pikmin science
2016-09-07 13:16:10	Marty2000	because I completely forgot, to be honest
2016-09-07 13:16:22	Marty2000	But well, you're used to it, aren't you? He he
2016-09-07 13:17:38	Marty2000	Also, the person I asked about their """glitch""" have deleted the glitch in question (on Miiverse)
2016-09-07 13:20:16	@Espyo	hehe
2016-09-07 13:20:20	@Espyo	...
2016-09-07 13:20:24	@Espyo	screw it
2016-09-07 13:22:02	Marty2000	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e5DOgrMg
2016-09-07 13:22:09	Marty2000	That's the first thing I need to verify
2016-09-07 13:22:41	Marty2000	I suppose that it happens when you use the Dodge move while some Pikmin hold bombs
2016-09-07 13:24:19	Marty2000	Wait, now that I look more closely at the pic'...
2016-09-07 13:24:44	Marty2000	The Pikmin seems to be holding a bomb while using its "hidden" animation
2016-09-07 13:24:58	Marty2000	You know, the one animation they use when hiding in a plant
2016-09-07 13:25:30	@Espyo	oh, I think it's just the Pikmin hiding
2016-09-07 13:25:35	@Espyo	no dodge involved
2016-09-07 13:25:47	@Espyo	besides, bomb rock Pikmin don't do anything when you use the Dodge Whistle
2016-09-07 13:25:49	@Espyo	they just run a bit faster
2016-09-07 13:26:46	Marty2000	Yeah, but they glitch if you keep dodging (particularly, Winged Pikmin)
2016-09-07 13:30:12	Marty2000	You can also glitch them a little if you hold them and then whistle (so they don't end up being thrown)
2016-09-07 13:30:28	Marty2000	Taking a pic'...
2016-09-07 13:31:05	Marty2000	https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69jmuyXUpOto5ox
2016-09-07 13:33:22	Marty2000	So, yeah, it's likely just the Pikmin hiding, Espyo: https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/WVW69jmuz6U-7_os9_
2016-09-07 13:33:45	Marty2000	Now, this: https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e1D8J9VA
2016-09-07 13:33:58	Marty2000	I can see two reasons:
2016-09-07 13:34:06	Marty2000	1. Near an electrical current
2016-09-07 13:34:14	Marty2000	2. Flash activated in a cave
2016-09-07 13:35:53	Marty2000	I'll try in a cave in the Distant Tundra
2016-09-07 13:39:37	Marty2000	Looks like that this light effect happens when you're close to a light bulb in a dark environement and you use the flash function
2016-09-07 13:40:56	@Espyo	huh, neat
2016-09-07 13:41:32	@Espyo	guess that makes sense
2016-09-07 13:41:44	@Espyo	oh, and this guy replied https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAADAAB2V0e6FHo0Fg

2016-09-07 13:42:16	Marty2000	I think I've already seen that glitch happen in a video before
2016-09-07 13:42:23	Marty2000	But I wouldn't be able to tell you what video
2016-09-07 13:42:41	Marty2000	I don't know, I feel like I remember something like that...
2016-09-07 13:45:24	@Espyo	yeah, it's familiar

2016-09-08 13:11:37	@Espyo	...great!
2016-09-08 13:11:45	@Espyo	it should be cut off at like 100
2016-09-08 13:11:54	@Espyo	people with signatures larger than that have no business being on a forum
2016-09-08 13:16:20	Yoshi2	it's just a bit silly because the rule till now on the forum was 250 pixel, and now various signatures are cut off

2016-09-08 19:48:34	Marty2000	I missed them
2016-09-08 19:59:14	Yoshi2	I should install blender on my notebook
2016-09-08 19:59:22	Yoshi2	it will be helpful for writing python plugins
2016-09-08 20:07:50	Yoshi2	the end result will be to be able to modify BW models, so it will be helpful to do the figuring out the model format in blender too
2016-09-08 20:07:54	Yoshi2	if that is possible
2016-09-08 20:11:53	Marty2000	I see. Good luck

2016-09-08 22:50:29	@Espyo	well, iunno either
2016-09-08 22:50:33	@Espyo	you'd have to search just as much as me
2016-09-08 22:50:37	@Espyo	but it can't be that hard, let's see...
2016-09-08 22:50:45	@Espyo	I can give you downloads for the files he said, though
2016-09-08 22:50:49	@Espyo	but hey, up to you
2016-09-08 22:50:57	@Espyo	if you want to disassemble BW, which you should, that's fine
2016-09-08 22:53:54	Yoshi2	the comparison to BMS is not quite correct becuase I'm familiar with the concepts of BMS (instructions that are interpreted by the game, and music happens) while I am not sure how animations work, so that will need some reading
2016-09-08 22:55:00	@Espyo	oh

2016-09-09 11:59:34	Yoshi2	bonus points to you if you figure out what I am doing here: https://i.imgur.com/y2j78r4.png
2016-09-09 12:01:11	@Espyo	you're trying to code in polygons instead of drawing them?
2016-09-09 12:01:36	@Espyo	from a set of vertexes that come from Python

2016-09-09 12:01:57	Yoshi2	end goal is to import BW terrain into blender
2016-09-09 12:02:13	@Espyo	...
2016-09-09 12:02:20	@Espyo	I never even thought about that possibility
2016-09-09 12:02:23	@Espyo	although it's so obvious
2016-09-09 12:02:28	@Espyo	yes
2016-09-09 12:02:30	@Espyo	a thousand times yes
2016-09-09 12:02:31	@Espyo	do this
2016-09-09 12:03:06	Yoshi2	because the terrain is heightmap based, I should be able to do this
2016-09-09 12:03:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-09 12:03:17	Yoshi2	which will get me a bit into writing blender plugins
2016-09-09 12:03:33	Yoshi2	and after that comes figuring out the model data
2016-09-09 12:05:12	Yoshi2	if I figure out how to do importing in blender, I can get the terrain working today
2016-09-09 12:05:25	Yoshi2	because I just need to plug in existing code
2016-09-09 12:07:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-09-09 13:07:29	Yoshi2	wiiiish me luck. This will probably go horribly :I
2016-09-09 13:07:38	Yoshi2	because I didn't adjust the scaling of the offsets
2016-09-09 13:08:37	Yoshi2	blender froze

2016-09-09 13:19:13	Yoshi2	let's see if dividing it by 64 makes it better
2016-09-09 13:32:39	Yoshi2	it almost worked
2016-09-09 13:32:53	Yoshi2	has some flaws though, I wonder if I can fix that
2016-09-09 13:33:13	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-09-09 13:35:25	Yoshi2	I also wonder what is better: have lots of small objects or one big object
