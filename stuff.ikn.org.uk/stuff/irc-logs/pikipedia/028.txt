2016-05-08 22:46:02	@PikFan	and I knew if I tried following you, we'd probably splat each other
2016-05-08 22:46:06	@PikFan	...so I went the other way
2016-05-08 22:46:06	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-08 22:46:20	@PikFan	anyway, that Japanese sniper was being a jerk, too

2016-05-09 14:42:36	Marty2000	Hmm, I have a question. Does the Plasm Wraith really have 320 HP? Not that I want to question the change, but I am surprised, it's less than a Red Bulborb http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Plasm_Wraith&curid=8368&diff=163867&oldid=163852
2016-05-09 14:49:56	@Espyo	yeah, I thought the exact same
2016-05-09 14:50:08	@Espyo	but the Plasm Wraith very likely doesn't follow a conventional attack method
2016-05-09 14:50:35	@Espyo	the value likely changes according to the amount of Plasm on the arena, nothing else
2016-05-09 14:50:44	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-09 14:50:46	Marty2000	Thanks

2016-05-09 14:55:53	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Stagnant_sea.png how do you get this image?
2016-05-09 14:57:51	Marty2000	When you choose a stage, then you have a general view of the area, before the battle commences
2016-05-09 14:58:08	@Espyo	yeah, but
2016-05-09 14:58:18	@Espyo	it has the name of the stage smack-dab in the middle
2016-05-09 14:58:42	Marty2000	It disappears, but the camera remains idle for a few seconds
2016-05-09 14:58:50	@Espyo	weird
2016-05-09 14:58:55	@Espyo	I could swear I tried doing this in the past
2016-05-09 14:59:11	@Espyo	and could never do it, because I get the text, and the camera splits and pans right afterwards
2016-05-09 14:59:12	Marty2000	It's fast
2016-05-09 14:59:28	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-09 14:59:29	Marty2000	Well yeah, it's a bit hard
2016-05-09 14:59:34	@Espyo	okay then
2016-05-09 15:02:15	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/0B5izo8x42A?t=3s Take a screenshot right when the song is starting to play
2016-05-09 15:03:53	@Espyo	right
2016-05-09 15:03:59	@Espyo	weird
2016-05-09 15:04:08	@Espyo	I thought there was no time at all
2016-05-09 15:04:09	@Espyo	but there is
2016-05-09 15:04:10	@Espyo	oh well
2016-05-09 15:06:09	UltraMario	hey Espyo, random question
2016-05-09 15:06:14	UltraMario	you've played melee, right?
2016-05-09 15:06:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-09 15:07:01	UltraMario	do you remember if the fighting wire frames could hang on ledges?
2016-05-09 15:07:01	UltraMario	:P
2016-05-09 15:07:06	UltraMario	i forget
2016-05-09 15:07:10	UltraMario	i dont think they could though
2016-05-09 15:07:10	UltraMario	iirc
2016-05-09 15:07:18	@Espyo	I think they can't, on Multi-Man Melee
2016-05-09 15:07:31	@Espyo	they might be able to if you hack them in as playable characters in a normal match, though
2016-05-09 15:07:43	UltraMario	i asked because im "including" them as bonuses in my melee themed smash 4 tourney
2016-05-09 15:07:43	UltraMario	;P
2016-05-09 15:07:56	@Espyo	model hacks?
2016-05-09 15:07:59	UltraMario	nah
2016-05-09 15:08:00	UltraMario	basically
2016-05-09 15:08:08	UltraMario	you play as zelda or falcon but handicapped
2016-05-09 15:08:22	UltraMario	no charging smash attacks or special moves
2016-05-09 15:08:22	UltraMario	:P
2016-05-09 15:08:43	UltraMario	i mean, they were pretty much clones of them, so
2016-05-09 15:08:46	UltraMario	it kinda works
2016-05-09 15:09:10	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-09 15:09:11	UltraMario	i dont think they could pick up items either
2016-05-09 15:09:14	UltraMario	iirc
2016-05-09 15:09:20	@Espyo	yeah, I think they couldn't
2016-05-09 15:10:39	UltraMario	ill look up footage to see if i remember right
2016-05-09 15:11:23	UltraMario	although
2016-05-09 15:11:28	UltraMario	speakinng of hacks
2016-05-09 15:11:48	UltraMario	i did get a bunch of melee tracks to make the tourney more authentic
2016-05-09 15:12:59	@Espyo	nice
2016-05-09 15:13:37	UltraMario	all the old victory themes, the break the targets theme, melee battlefield, multi-man melee 1, jungle japes, fourside, and the full-length versions of pollyana and the dk rap 
2016-05-09 15:13:42	UltraMario	idk why they had to shorten those songs
2016-05-09 15:13:43	UltraMario	:V
2016-05-09 15:14:07	@Espyo	to save on space, I guess
2016-05-09 15:14:12	@Espyo	Smash can be a digital download now
2016-05-09 15:14:16	@Espyo	so it sucks to have it be massive
2016-05-09 15:14:24	UltraMario	well
2016-05-09 15:14:41	UltraMario	im thinking maybe it mightve had to do with being able to fit a 2 minute time match
2016-05-09 15:14:47	UltraMario	or something
2016-05-09 15:14:48	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2016-05-09 15:16:15	UltraMario	i miss break the targets though
2016-05-09 15:16:15	UltraMario	;w;
2016-05-09 15:16:24	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-09 15:16:26	UltraMario	no one asked for an angry birds knock-off :V

2016-05-09 15:42:44	Klemen702	hm ok
2016-05-09 15:42:52	UltraMario	did they modify the game to make them specifically hold items? :P
2016-05-09 15:42:54	Klemen702	i have no rom or whatever tho
2016-05-09 15:42:56	UltraMario	or did they just get codes
2016-05-09 15:43:00	UltraMario	thats what i mean
2016-05-09 15:43:25	UltraMario	those are two different kinds of hacking
2016-05-09 15:45:13	UltraMario	oh yeah
2016-05-09 15:45:15	UltraMario	i just noticed
2016-05-09 15:45:57	Klemen702	didn't some peeps make SSBM playable online thanks to emulating?
2016-05-09 15:46:18	UltraMario	well
2016-05-09 15:46:23	UltraMario	any game can work online with emulating
2016-05-09 15:48:32	Klemen702	even singleplayer intended games?
2016-05-09 15:51:11	UltraMario	well
2016-05-09 15:51:13	UltraMario	sorta
2016-05-09 15:51:31	UltraMario	theyd have to hack in multiplayer functionality if you mean playing with 2 players
2016-05-09 15:51:31	UltraMario	but
2016-05-09 15:51:45	UltraMario	you can technically do 2 player in single player games with dolphi
2016-05-09 15:51:46	Klemen702	eh
2016-05-09 15:51:46	UltraMario	n
2016-05-09 15:51:58	Klemen702	i wonder

2016-05-09 15:52:56	Klemen702	but people can watch you play
2016-05-09 15:52:56	UltraMario	?

2016-05-09 15:54:03	Klemen702	netplay
2016-05-09 15:54:29	UltraMario	well
2016-05-09 15:54:30	UltraMario	it can
2016-05-09 15:54:38	UltraMario	depends on how good your connection is
2016-05-09 15:54:50	UltraMario	 / how good your computer is at emulating gamecube games
2016-05-09 15:58:45	Klemen702	i have no idea
2016-05-09 15:58:51	Klemen702	i never emulated gamecube games
2016-05-09 15:58:57	UltraMario	well i was just answering

2016-05-09 16:44:51	@Espyo	huh?
2016-05-09 16:44:53	@Espyo	that's confusing

2016-05-09 16:45:10	Marty2000	Wait, I'm uploading a video
2016-05-09 16:46:59	Marty2000	Also, http://www.pikminwiki.com/Glitches_in_Pikmin_2#Carrying_Louie_during_a_cutscene "This makes the King of Bugs the only treasure that can be carried during a cutscene." is wrong. You can carry any treasure given certain circumstances. I'll try to make a video when I have time, but basically, you have to throw Pikmin on the treasure when the cutscene
2016-05-09 16:47:22	Marty2000	begins (works better with the Explorer's Friend Series)

2016-05-09 16:49:18	Marty2000	Already fixed
2016-05-09 16:49:38	@Espyo	hmm... I don't think it's the same bug as the Dweevil
2016-05-09 16:49:46	@Espyo	with the Dweevil, you get it to pick up something
2016-05-09 16:49:56	@Espyo	while it has something on its back, it is in a state where it cannot be killed
2016-05-09 16:50:03	@Espyo	since the game doesn't expect it to lose HP in that state
2016-05-09 16:50:37	@Espyo	but for the Snagret...
2016-05-09 16:50:40	@Espyo	it seems like something else
2016-05-09 16:50:48	@Espyo	there's no equivalent to the Dweevil's "carrying" state
2016-05-09 16:50:56	Marty2000	Yes

2016-05-09 16:52:09	Marty2000	But both creatures can live "without" health... Strange. It also works with Pellet Posies, depending on where you throw your Pikmin on it (and I suspect it even depends on the Pikmin type)
2016-05-09 16:52:56	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-09 16:53:02	@Espyo	it's hard to say if they really have 0 health though

2016-05-09 16:53:07	@Espyo	without looking at the game's memory
2016-05-09 16:53:11	@Espyo	they could just have like 0.5
2016-05-09 16:53:13	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-09 16:53:16	@Espyo	which, for calculating the wheel, rounds to 0
2016-05-09 16:58:04	Marty2000	I have also a kind of glitch (maybe it's not one): after pushing a carboard box (P1) or crushing a bag (P2) , the invisible walls that prevent the player from throwing Pikmin to the other side of the obstacle (when it's not pushed or crushed) are still present

2016-05-09 17:09:42	Marty2000	Well, the video will be here in a few minutes. As for "This makes the King of Bugs the only treasure that can be carried during a cutscene.", I have just made a video for it and if you throw a Pikmin on any treasure before the cutscene, it works. It doesn't if they are dismissed. The same applies to other tasks (such as digging)

2016-05-09 17:15:10	@Espyo	wow, that is weird
2016-05-09 17:15:26	@Espyo	but I guess it's simply a geometry problem
2016-05-09 17:15:30	@Espyo	I'll check if it's the same on the GC
2016-05-09 17:16:29	Marty2000	I think it's the same
2016-05-09 17:19:36	@Espyo	oh, so it IS the same
2016-05-09 17:19:41	@Espyo	but I wouldn't really call this a glitch
2016-05-09 17:19:50	@Espyo	nor a mistake...
2016-05-09 17:19:53	@Espyo	but it's an oversight all the same
2016-05-09 17:19:54	@Espyo	it's like
2016-05-09 17:19:59	@Espyo	it's not very WRONG that there's a wall there
2016-05-09 17:20:06	@Espyo	even after you cleared the obstacle
2016-05-09 17:20:18	@Espyo	but it is a bit distracting that the wall is there when there's no obstacle
2016-05-09 17:20:18	Marty2000	They probably forgot to include something that removes it after clearing the obstacle

2016-05-09 17:36:28	@Espyo	might as well change the glitch on the page, then

2016-05-09 17:39:35	Marty2000	I couldn't test with The King of Bugs but does it work even if the Pikmin aren't thrown?
2016-05-09 17:40:33	Marty2000	Because according to the glitch on the article, it seems to be the case
2016-05-09 17:40:39	Marty2000	But I'm not sure.

2016-05-09 18:28:37	Marty2000	By the way, another glitch occured to me, some months ago, but I could never reproduce it and sadly, I wasn't recording. On the sublevel 3 of the Subterranean Complex, a walking Armored Cannon Larva froze for a second and became grounded afterwards. I have no idea what caused this
2016-05-09 18:33:30	@Espyo	uh
2016-05-09 18:33:31	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-09 18:33:35	@Espyo	that sounds really broken
2016-05-09 18:36:07	Marty2000	I am retrying to get it but it's hard... I don't even know how to do. I just remember that it froze when I had thrown Purple Pikmin on it
2016-05-09 18:36:58	@Espyo	I've never seen anything like it
2016-05-09 18:37:06	@Espyo	so it must be one of those really specific and rare glitches
2016-05-09 18:37:08	@Espyo	don't bother with it
2016-05-09 18:37:22	@Espyo	btw, we should put the info on the invisible walls somewhere
2016-05-09 18:37:28	@Espyo	I...guess they can be called a glitch
2016-05-09 18:37:43	@Espyo	I can't think of anything else to do with them
2016-05-09 18:37:53	@Espyo	it'll have to be placed on the P1 and P2 glitch articles

2016-05-11 18:28:18	En_Passant	okay, what about the other stuff
2016-05-11 18:34:04	@Espyo	what about the required fields?
2016-05-11 18:34:09	@Espyo	what do you want them to behave like?
2016-05-11 18:35:13	En_Passant	being on different lines is a good start
2016-05-11 18:36:27	En_Passant	plus, there's an optional field between them that doesn't show up
2016-05-11 18:40:54	@Espyo	I can't really check with detail
2016-05-11 18:41:15	@Espyo	but having mandatory and optional fields is always a pain

2016-05-11 20:29:53	En_Passant	There are a couple of parts that appear above the Character information heading even though they should be below it

2016-05-11 21:48:13	En_Passant	The only possible conclusion is that it thinks my required fields are really empty
2016-05-11 22:00:45	En_Passant	They appear if I remove the formatting stuff, even though the formatting is fine on the optional fields

2016-05-12 10:21:30	Neocraftz1553	hmmm
2016-05-12 10:22:20	Neocraftz1553	actually, search up "Woodlouse hunter spider"
2016-05-12 10:22:32	Neocraftz1553	Those damn spiders, scaring me outside
2016-05-12 10:22:41	Marty2000	I see

2016-05-12 10:26:59	Neocraftz1553	I've only seen 2(1 inside), but still
2016-05-12 10:27:36	Marty2000	I've never seen this spider where I live, though

2016-05-12 10:28:01	Marty2000	Probably because of the climate, I guess

2016-05-12 10:29:58	Marty2000	Well then, I still have never seen that little spider

2016-05-12 10:32:40	Neocraftz1553	Their bite doesn't hurt as much as other spiders
2016-05-12 10:32:48	Neocraftz1553	like a bee sting

2016-05-12 10:33:12	Neocraftz1553	(hurts like hell in some cases, though)
2016-05-12 10:33:43	Neocraftz1553	But, do your research first... they somewhat resemble another type of spider that is deadly
2016-05-12 10:33:59	Neocraftz1553	a Brown Recluse, I think... or maybe I'm way off...
2016-05-12 10:34:38	Neocraftz1553	Also, they are attracted to bugs if you keep them :|
2016-05-12 10:34:58	Neocraftz1553	especially Pillbugs and Woodlice
2016-05-12 10:35:12	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-12 10:35:32	Neocraftz1553	but grasshoppers and crickets will attract them as well

2016-05-12 10:40:15	Neocraftz1553	with its feet, anyways

2016-05-12 10:51:20	Neocraftz1553	more like glide
2016-05-12 10:51:31	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-12 10:51:36	Neocraftz1553	most grasshoppers can't fly around here
2016-05-12 10:51:45	Neocraftz1553	just hop clumsily
2016-05-12 10:52:01	Neocraftz1553	and miserably, like the drunk hobos of the insect world
2016-05-12 10:52:42	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-12 10:53:05	Neocraftz1553	once, once flew into a bus that was passing by

2016-05-12 10:55:08	Neocraftz1553	even though theres more than likely none left...
2016-05-12 10:55:44	Marty2000	Ok
2016-05-12 10:56:14	Neocraftz1553	hmmm...........

2016-05-12 10:57:16	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-05-12 10:57:29	Neocraftz1553	If Earwigs got big enough, they could finally put some use into their "Pincers"
2016-05-12 10:57:40	Neocraftz1553	pincers, pinchers, whatevuh
2016-05-12 10:57:55	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-12 10:57:57	Marty2000	Probably
2016-05-12 10:58:08	Neocraftz1553	I'll do an expirsment
2016-05-12 10:58:13	Neocraftz1553	FOR SCIENCE!!!
2016-05-12 10:58:37	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-05-12 10:58:48	Neocraftz1553	that would be awsome, but frightening
2016-05-12 10:59:14	Neocraftz1553	now, lets think of 5 inch insects...
2016-05-12 10:59:23	Neocraftz1553	:p

2016-05-12 10:59:50	Marty2000	I will have to go soon, but I'll stay connected and be back in... let's say, one or two hours (I have to eat and do something)

2016-05-12 11:39:57	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-12 11:43:28	Yoshi2	earlier I was wtf'ing because I couldn't find the qt enums in pyqt
2016-05-12 11:43:54	Yoshi2	the qt docs put them under the Qt namespace, so I tried import PyQt5.Qt
2016-05-12 11:44:07	Yoshi2	nope, they are under PyQt5.QtCore.Qt
2016-05-12 11:44:12	Yoshi2	:-|
2016-05-12 11:44:57	Yoshi2	and to make matters more confusing, the first module does exist, but doesn't have the enums
2016-05-12 11:45:25	@Espyo	eeeesy
2016-05-12 11:45:28	@Espyo	*eeeessh
2016-05-12 11:45:36	@Espyo	might say that somewhere on a changelog, though

2016-05-12 11:53:44	Yoshi2	it's probably just a quirk of pyqt throwing stuff into qtcore

2016-05-12 13:38:18	@Espyo	is that canon?
2016-05-12 13:38:23	@Espyo	or fan-made?
2016-05-12 13:38:26	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-12 13:38:28	Marty2000	From SSBB
2016-05-12 13:38:36	@Espyo	...what?
2016-05-12 13:38:39	Marty2000	I think
2016-05-12 13:38:41	@Espyo	there was no English version in Brawl
2016-05-12 13:38:46	@Espyo	Brawl had the Japanese and French versions
2016-05-12 13:38:50	Marty2000	Really?
2016-05-12 13:38:56	@Espyo	definitely
2016-05-12 13:38:56	Marty2000	Wait...
2016-05-12 13:39:05	@Espyo	this is the first time I've heard an English version
2016-05-12 13:39:09	@Espyo	and I played a lot of Brawl
2016-05-12 13:39:13	Marty2000	If you think so, I'll remove it
2016-05-12 13:39:23	@Espyo	yeah, this has to be fan-made
2016-05-12 13:39:28	Marty2000	I was sure there was an English version
2016-05-12 13:39:30	@Espyo	there was never any official English release
2016-05-12 13:39:34	@Espyo	nope

2016-05-12 13:39:48	@Espyo	oh, when you edit the article
2016-05-12 13:39:58	@Espyo	make it a bit clearer that the translation after the French version is translating the French version
2016-05-12 13:40:11	@Espyo	because that section is just called "English version", and it's not clear that it's a translation of the French version
2016-05-12 13:40:47	Marty2000	I called English translation
2016-05-12 13:40:51	Marty2000	The translation from French
2016-05-12 13:40:58	Marty2000	If I remember
2016-05-12 13:40:59	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-12 13:41:05	Marty2000	Sorry if I didn't

2016-05-12 15:12:35	@Espyo	it's a big help, for sure
2016-05-12 15:12:38	@Espyo	I wanted something automatic
2016-05-12 15:12:45	@Espyo	but if I ever make such an automatic service
2016-05-12 15:12:49	@Espyo	having a list like this is great
2016-05-12 15:12:50	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-12 15:12:55	@Espyo	I'll safekeep it
2016-05-12 15:14:08	Marty2000	You're welcome.
2016-05-12 15:14:29	@Espyo	btw, the timings you added on the whistle article
2016-05-12 15:14:36	@Espyo	how accurate are they?
2016-05-12 15:15:19	Marty2000	Honestly, I used a stopwatch... but I got the same times like... 5 or 6 times
2016-05-12 15:15:26	Marty2000	So I guess they're correct
2016-05-12 15:15:55	@Espyo	without measuring the frames or something, I don't think it's fair to say these are perfect
2016-05-12 15:16:03	@Espyo	saying they're "around" X or Y seconds seems fair
2016-05-12 15:16:06	@Espyo	good enough for the reader
2016-05-12 15:16:07	Marty2000	Yes, they're not perfect for sure
2016-05-12 15:16:09	@Espyo	and technically correct
2016-05-12 15:16:15	Marty2000	Maybe "around"
2016-05-12 15:16:19	@Espyo	heck, even if we measured frames, it's still not that easy
2016-05-12 15:16:24	Marty2000	Didn't I say around? I'll go add it if so
2016-05-12 15:16:37	@Espyo	no, you didn't
2016-05-12 15:16:44	Marty2000	Well, I always forgot
2016-05-12 15:16:46	Marty2000	Gonna add it
2016-05-12 15:16:59	@Espyo	even if we tried to measure by frames, when would you start timing? when you press the button, or when the whistle comes out?
2016-05-12 15:17:12	Marty2000	When I press the button
2016-05-12 15:17:16	Marty2000	That's what I did
2016-05-12 15:17:16	@Espyo	how do you know the whistle comes out? when a Pikmin is ready to react, or when you visibly see particles?
2016-05-12 15:17:25	@Espyo	so it's pretty complicated to get a "perfect" measurement
2016-05-12 15:17:43	@Espyo	unless the game's files tell us... the best we can come up, even with accurate tools, is a value "around" X or Y seconds
2016-05-12 15:17:52	@Espyo	so we really need to add the "around" or "roughly" to the article
2016-05-12 15:19:47	@Espyo	oh, also...
2016-05-12 15:19:53	@Espyo	the European version of P1 runs slower
2016-05-12 15:20:04	@Espyo	so that needs its own timing compared to the Japanese and US versions :/
2016-05-12 15:20:17	Yoshi2	25/50 fps?
2016-05-12 15:20:22	Marty2000	50

2016-05-12 15:28:37	@Espyo	it's the same, but not the same

2016-05-12 15:29:43	@Espyo	yeah, but that makes sense to exist on the "Abstract Masterpiece" article
2016-05-12 15:29:51	@Espyo	since that's a guide on how to get the European Abstract Masterpiece
2016-05-12 15:30:00	@Espyo	we only say the guide is the same to avoid having to copy-paste
2016-05-12 15:30:24	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-12 15:30:27	@Espyo	wait, I think I know what the misunderstanding is

2016-05-12 15:30:34	@Espyo	except
2016-05-12 15:30:44	@Espyo	the section name isn't meant to say "in the European version"
2016-05-12 15:30:57	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-12 15:30:58	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-12 15:31:02	Marty2000	Didn't see
2016-05-12 15:31:05	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-12 15:31:06	Marty2000	(because I copy-pasted)
2016-05-12 15:31:10	@Espyo	yeah, I figured
2016-05-12 15:31:10	Marty2000	Sorry for that
2016-05-12 15:31:12	@Espyo	no worries
2016-05-12 15:32:31	@Espyo	oh, you removed the real-world image?
2016-05-12 15:32:55	Marty2000	Did I?
2016-05-12 15:33:15	@Espyo	yeah... http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Yell_Battery&diff=next&oldid=163940
2016-05-12 15:34:27	Marty2000	That's odd, I added it yesterday

2016-05-12 15:34:40	Marty2000	I'm gonna re-add it
2016-05-12 15:34:43	@Espyo	dunno
2016-05-12 15:36:10	Marty2000	?
2016-05-12 15:36:16	Marty2000	I have just added it
2016-05-12 15:54:25	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Forged_Courage&curid=704&diff=163881&oldid=159133 actually, a lot of treasures follow this trait
2016-05-12 15:54:38	@Espyo	the weight adjusts to the strength of your Pikmin army after a battle
2016-05-12 15:54:51	@Espyo	to make sure you can still carry it after the fight, so you don't have to do it again if you don't want to
2016-05-12 15:55:03	@Espyo	we just don't know the list of treasures that do this
2016-05-12 15:55:09	@Espyo	I wish we did, though
2016-05-12 15:55:14	Marty2000	I think it's the same for all Explorer's Friends treasures
2016-05-12 15:55:18	@Espyo	but that requires going through the game and testing
2016-05-12 15:55:23	@Espyo	yeah, that might just be it
2016-05-12 15:55:28	Marty2000	I can do it if you want
2016-05-12 15:55:33	Marty2000	It doesn't bother me
2016-05-12 15:55:38	@Espyo	you sure?
2016-05-12 15:55:47	Marty2000	No it's okay
2016-05-12 15:55:52	@Espyo	all right then
2016-05-12 15:55:54	@Espyo	yeah, that'd be cool
2016-05-12 15:56:04	Marty2000	I see it more like a challenge to fight enemies with few Pikmin
2016-05-12 15:56:12	@Espyo	I've been dying to add that info to the wiki ever since we found out it was a thing and started talking about it, some years ago
2016-05-12 15:56:16	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-05-12 15:56:36	@Espyo	I wonder if enemies like the Fiery Bulblax also trigger this
2016-05-12 15:56:52	Marty2000	Wonder so
2016-05-12 15:57:10	Marty2000	I have to know how many Pikmin I must bring with me, though
2016-05-12 15:57:15	Marty2000	Maybe 10 for each cave is good
2016-05-12 15:57:16	@Espyo	 100
2016-05-12 15:57:23	@Espyo	or less
2016-05-12 15:57:25	@Espyo	your choice
2016-05-12 15:57:27	Marty2000	And for treasures I miss
2016-05-12 15:57:34	Marty2000	It would mean their weight doesn't change
2016-05-12 15:57:57	@Espyo	I mean
2016-05-12 15:57:59	@Espyo	you can bring 100
2016-05-12 15:58:03	@Espyo	beat up the boss
2016-05-12 15:58:10	@Espyo	till its health is very small
2016-05-12 15:58:13	UltraMario	you know
2016-05-12 15:58:14	UltraMario	tbh
2016-05-12 15:58:15	Marty2000	Ah yes
2016-05-12 15:58:16	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-12 15:58:21	@Espyo	and then kill your Pikmin until you get only like 5 or 3 or something
2016-05-12 15:58:22	@Espyo	and test
2016-05-12 15:58:24	@Espyo	I know it works that way too
2016-05-12 15:58:25	UltraMario	ive never really gotten too much into this series
2016-05-12 15:58:27	UltraMario	;-;
2016-05-12 15:58:30	UltraMario	am i a fraud
2016-05-12 15:58:43	@Espyo	but I'm actually not sure if it DOES decrease the number if you bring only a few Pikmin with you from the start of the cave
2016-05-12 15:58:55	@Espyo	it makes sense for the weight to go down to reward you for beating the boss
2016-05-12 15:59:10	@Espyo	but maybe if you already bring too few to begin with, the game might NOT change the weight, to punish you for bringing only a few
2016-05-12 15:59:14	@Espyo	it's worth a check
2016-05-12 15:59:21	@Espyo	but that only needs to be checked once, I'd say
2016-05-12 15:59:27	Marty2000	I've already tried by bringing a single Pikmin
2016-05-12 15:59:32	@Espyo	UltraMario: don't worry much about it
2016-05-12 15:59:37	@Espyo	neither has Yoshi2, and he's a valuable member here
2016-05-12 15:59:43	Marty2000	That's how I found it out
2016-05-12 15:59:46	@Espyo	we're a group of people that chat around, really
2016-05-12 15:59:51	@Espyo	we just focus on Pikmin more than the rest
2016-05-12 15:59:56	@Espyo	but other than that, it's just people talkig
2016-05-12 16:00:03	@Espyo	oh, is that so?
2016-05-12 16:00:03	UltraMario	well i mean
2016-05-12 16:00:05	@Espyo	good to know then
2016-05-12 16:00:07	UltraMario	dont get me wrong
2016-05-12 16:00:07	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 16:00:09	UltraMario	i have like
2016-05-12 16:00:16	UltraMario	some experience with this series at least
2016-05-12 16:00:16	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-12 16:00:20	@Espyo	all right, in that case, you only need to test bosses with a few Pikmin surviving
2016-05-12 16:00:21	UltraMario	im not completely blind
2016-05-12 16:00:32	@Espyo	yeah, you're not completely unaware of what's up
2016-05-12 16:00:38	UltraMario	i used to watch my brother play the first game when i was a kid
2016-05-12 16:00:41	Yoshi2	UltraMario: if anything you are a fraud because you rarely say anything in this channel  ( °▽ °)
2016-05-12 16:00:47	UltraMario	>:#
2016-05-12 16:01:18	UltraMario	i dont really have much of a reason too if i dont know pikmin as well as you guys
2016-05-12 16:01:19	UltraMario	;-;
2016-05-12 16:01:21	Yoshi2	lack of experience is not an issue because you can easily pick that up if you wanted
2016-05-12 16:01:24	Marty2000	By the way, I don't know for you all, but I still have my first savefile from 2009
2016-05-12 16:01:29	Marty2000	Day 377
2016-05-12 16:01:38	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-12 16:01:47	@Espyo	I wanted to play my first save file for longer
2016-05-12 16:01:50	@Espyo	but never really found the time
2016-05-12 16:01:54	@Espyo	it's at like day 70
2016-05-12 16:02:15	Marty2000	I use it more for experiments and corpses in cave (money!)
2016-05-12 16:02:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-12 16:04:26	UltraMario	Yoshi2: but i only have the 3rd game and the 2nd game somewhere on  wii ;-;
2016-05-12 16:04:56	UltraMario	i havent played em too much
2016-05-12 16:05:17	Yoshi2	UltraMario: I have the 3rd game on the wii u and the 2nd game on my pc :I
2016-05-12 16:05:57	UltraMario	well
2016-05-12 16:05:57	Marty2000	Have you both ever played the first one?
2016-05-12 16:06:07	UltraMario	i have the new play control version
2016-05-12 16:06:16	UltraMario	i may have played a bit of the original on gamecube
2016-05-12 16:06:19	UltraMario	but it was like
2016-05-12 16:06:21	UltraMario	a long time ago
2016-05-12 16:06:22	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-12 16:06:25	Yoshi2	Marty2000: nope, I have it here too but haven't played it yet
2016-05-12 16:06:38	UltraMario	i do know though i used to watch my brother play it a lot
2016-05-12 16:06:42	Yoshi2	only got it when I was figuring out BMS stuff
2016-05-12 16:06:46	UltraMario	btw
2016-05-12 16:06:51	Marty2000	The first one may seem simple compared to the 2 and 3, but it's my favorite Pikmin
2016-05-12 16:06:55	UltraMario	i think my first introduction to the series was from
2016-05-12 16:06:58	UltraMario	luigi's mansion
2016-05-12 16:06:58	UltraMario	xP
2016-05-12 16:07:05	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-12 16:07:07	UltraMario	the trailer in the options menu
2016-05-12 16:07:23	Marty2000	There was a trailer of Pikmin in the game, rigith?
2016-05-12 16:07:25	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-12 16:07:30	Marty2000	right*
2016-05-12 16:09:50	UltraMario	yah
2016-05-12 16:09:52	UltraMario	*yeah
2016-05-12 16:09:57	UltraMario	oh yeah
2016-05-12 16:10:05	UltraMario	also the olimar and pikmin trophies in melee
2016-05-12 16:10:26	@Espyo	ok, so, this weight change mechanic does not apply to treasures in the overworld, or treasures out in the open in caves
2016-05-12 16:10:30	Marty2000	Well, I am retrieving the first treasure right now... I think I'll have finished checking by the end of the day (real world)
2016-05-12 16:10:31	@Espyo	it might happen to:
2016-05-12 16:10:48	Marty2000	I suspected so
2016-05-12 16:11:10	@Espyo	a) all treaures inside enemies
2016-05-12 16:11:13	-->	En_Passant (Mibbit@49-076-072-019.hlrn.qwest.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-12 16:11:14	@Espyo	b) specific treasures
2016-05-12 16:11:16	@Espyo	one of the two
2016-05-12 16:11:24	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-12 16:11:25	@Espyo	so it's important to test anything that an enemy can release
2016-05-12 16:11:31	Marty2000	Sure
2016-05-12 16:11:41	@Espyo	that should be easy
2016-05-12 16:11:52	@Espyo	if you're sure you want to start a new playthrough just for this... then good luck!
2016-05-12 16:12:01	@Espyo	at least this experiment won't have any difficulty to it
2016-05-12 16:12:03	@Espyo	I mean, it will, a bit
2016-05-12 16:12:12	@Espyo	defeating a boss with only a few Pikmin is a bit tough
2016-05-12 16:12:15	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-12 16:12:22	Marty2000	Well, i'll see anyway
2016-05-12 16:12:24	@Espyo	even if you whittle its health before killing the Pikmin
2016-05-12 16:12:49	UltraMario	i dont think my brother ever got to get the gamecube version of the 2nd game though
2016-05-12 16:12:57	UltraMario	we could never find it in any stores
2016-05-12 16:12:58	UltraMario	D:
2016-05-12 16:13:10	@Espyo	yeah, it's not that common
2016-05-12 16:13:41	Marty2000	I could play the first Pikmin game once, but then the GameCube I bought got broken :/
2016-05-12 16:13:47	Marty2000	Only played for 3 days
2016-05-12 16:14:08	Yoshi2	I'm kinda happy I got some GC games as originals, but some of them don't work anymore because they got scratched :/
2016-05-12 16:14:14	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-12 16:14:14	@Espyo	aw, that sucks
2016-05-12 16:14:14	UltraMario	same
2016-05-12 16:14:33	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-12 16:16:56	@Espyo	oh, Marty
2016-05-12 16:17:00	@Espyo	since you're replaying the game
2016-05-12 16:17:01	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-05-12 16:17:07	@Espyo	can you check one other thing?
2016-05-12 16:17:08	@Espyo	it's simple
2016-05-12 16:17:11	Marty2000	Sure
2016-05-12 16:17:14	Marty2000	Hi En_Passant
2016-05-12 16:17:14	@Espyo	try not to get too many Piklopedia entries
2016-05-12 16:17:19	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-12 16:17:25	@Espyo	and when you lose Louie and get the President
2016-05-12 16:17:30	Marty2000	Anyway, I'm trying to get as few Pikmin as possible
2016-05-12 16:17:33	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-12 16:17:35	@Espyo	see if it's possible to unlock Piklopedia entries
2016-05-12 16:17:41	@Espyo	it very likely is
2016-05-12 16:17:41	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-12 16:17:44	@Espyo	although it doesn't make sense
2016-05-12 16:17:47	@Espyo	because the entries have Louie's notes
2016-05-12 16:17:50	Marty2000	Sure I'll check
2016-05-12 16:17:57	@Espyo	and...Louie's not around to write those notes, right?
2016-05-12 16:18:06	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-12 16:18:15	Marty2000	I think you can unlock them, though
2016-05-12 16:18:23	Marty2000	But it's worth checking
2016-05-12 16:18:31	@Espyo	maybe the developers remembered that scenario and made it so you can't get new Piklopedia entries (or maybe just no new Louie's notes) until you have Louie with you (as a leader or as the King of Bugs)
2016-05-12 16:18:37	@Espyo	I'd bet you can, too
2016-05-12 16:18:44	@Espyo	but it should be easy to check if you're playing again
2016-05-12 16:18:45	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-12 16:19:10	Marty2000	Ok
2016-05-12 16:19:23	Marty2000	Right now I'm entering the Emergence Cave with 11 red Pikmin
2016-05-12 16:19:31	@Espyo	that was quick
2016-05-12 16:19:33	Marty2000	I think these treasures will keep their weight, though
2016-05-12 16:20:12	@Espyo	same
2016-05-12 16:20:23	Marty2000	Yes they do
2016-05-12 16:20:29	Marty2000	(first sublevel)
2016-05-12 16:21:02	Marty2000	At least the Citrus Lump
2016-05-12 16:21:11	Marty2000	I will have to check with the capsule
2016-05-12 16:21:17	Marty2000	Going to do so
2016-05-12 16:24:55	En_Passant	Is this a hack?
2016-05-12 16:25:26	Marty2000	Still 4 Pikmin required to retrive the 7 Up capsule
2016-05-12 16:25:29	Marty2000	Sorry?
2016-05-12 16:25:37	Marty2000	What is a hack?
2016-05-12 16:36:36	Marty2000	Now that I read what I wrote again... sorry, I meant "what is the hack you are talking about?'
2016-05-12 16:37:11	UltraMario	pikmin 2?
2016-05-12 16:37:16	UltraMario	more like porduct placement 2

2016-05-12 16:40:01	Yoshi2	yes, we talked about how to take over the world
2016-05-12 16:40:10	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 16:40:15	UltraMario	o
2016-05-12 16:40:18	UltraMario	what did you say
2016-05-12 16:40:25	Marty2000	We thought we might need the help of White Pikmin to poison lazy people
2016-05-12 16:41:00	UltraMario	heh
2016-05-12 16:41:11	UltraMario	dont poison me tho ;w;
2016-05-12 16:41:29	Marty2000	I'll think of it with Yoshi2 ;)
2016-05-12 16:42:42	Marty2000	Ok, Espyo, I'm entering the White Flower Gardne with a single Purple Pikmin (that I'll transform into a White one)

2016-05-12 16:42:51	@Espyo	right
2016-05-12 16:42:56	@Espyo	so you're just entering the caves with 1 Pikmin?
2016-05-12 16:43:05	Marty2000	I'll see
2016-05-12 16:43:11	@Espyo	because that sounds fun
2016-05-12 16:43:12	Marty2000	But for the moment, I do
2016-05-12 16:43:23	@Espyo	nice
2016-05-12 16:44:16	Marty2000	And I'll eventually retrieve the treasures I couldn't retrieve a second time
2016-05-12 16:49:47	Marty2000	The White Pikmin is digging up this http://www.pikminwiki.com/Superstick_Textile
2016-05-12 16:49:51	Marty2000	We'll know soon
2016-05-12 16:49:58	Marty2000	But since I have a single Pikmin, it takes time
2016-05-12 16:52:12	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-12 16:53:59	Marty2000	You need 30 Pikmin for it...

2016-05-12 17:17:42	Marty2000	It's funny, they added that photo http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ladle6.hpi.jpg
2016-05-12 17:17:54	Marty2000	We added the same on Pikipedia
2016-05-12 17:20:14	Yoshi2	the guy doesn't seem to have anything malicious in mind but still whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, we don't really need a second subreddit that is also about modding
2016-05-12 17:24:02	@Espyo	heh, yeah
2016-05-12 17:24:20	@Espyo	and yeah, if he wants the sub to be about general discussion, sure
2016-05-12 17:24:32	@Espyo	but if you have one that's going strong with moddding
2016-05-12 17:24:35	@Espyo	then it's just dumb
2016-05-12 17:24:39	Yoshi2	if it had a different scope I'd support him 95% but let's keep all the modding in one sub pls
2016-05-12 17:24:45	@Espyo	it's like he wants to be an admin of anything BW
2016-05-12 17:26:37	Yoshi2	I'll talk to the other mod first about what to say to him because right now I'm pretty speechless

2016-05-12 17:38:10	Marty2000	I've just unlocked the P.P and I'm going to unlock Yellows to test in the Glutton's Kitchen afterwards
2016-05-12 17:38:41	Marty2000	I guess it will change for the treasure contained in the Giant Breadbug
2016-05-12 17:38:44	Super-toad65	...with glitches?

2016-05-12 18:05:49	Marty2000	I am going to see if some treasure can be carried with a single Pikmin. Like this one: http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/19/1463069156-napsack.jpg

2016-05-12 18:08:08	Marty2000	I'll modify later
2016-05-12 18:08:15	Marty2000	And I'll check for the GameCube version

2016-05-12 18:34:01	Marty2000	Sure it'll be fun to defeat the Pileated Snagret wih it
2016-05-12 18:40:17	Marty2000	The greatest thing : having a single Purple Pikmin on its leaf stage trying to destroy a black gate
2016-05-12 18:42:40	Marty2000	Actually, it's not so long
2016-05-12 18:43:13	Marty2000	I thought it would be very time-consuming at first
2016-05-12 18:49:03	@Espyo	they attack for 20
2016-05-12 18:49:05	@Espyo	strongest attack
2016-05-12 18:49:09	@Espyo	so yeah, could be a lot worse

2016-05-12 19:12:04	@Espyo	hm, are there any non-Exploration Kit treasures dropped by bosses?
2016-05-12 19:12:16	@Espyo	I remember that there is a non-boss enemy that has an Exploration Kit treasure though, the Rocket Fist
2016-05-12 19:12:28	Marty2000	Yes, the Mamuta

2016-05-12 19:27:53	@Espyo	you forgot to mention the Burrowing Snagrets though
2016-05-12 19:27:54	@Espyo	I think
2016-05-12 19:27:58	Klemen702	does anyone know an emulator for FAMICOM games
2016-05-12 19:28:08	Klemen702	and if you can ''save'' on it
2016-05-12 19:28:18	@Espyo	see, this is why we needed a deep experiment

2016-05-12 19:28:30	@Espyo	since the Rocket Fist doesn't change
2016-05-12 19:28:34	Klemen702	i don't usually pirate shit but there is something important i need

2016-05-12 19:28:52	Klemen702	okay
2016-05-12 19:28:57	@Espyo	because they need the best and most accurate in order to accept speedruns
2016-05-12 19:29:21	@Espyo	FCEUX is their preferred NES emulator
2016-05-12 19:29:25	@Espyo	(NES/Famicon)
2016-05-12 19:29:51	@Espyo	so it should be the best around

2016-05-12 20:13:35	Klemen702	last question about FCEUX
2016-05-12 20:13:49	Klemen702	on which tab can i find a thing that tells you the controls?
2016-05-12 20:13:59	Klemen702	i can't understand this ching chong
2016-05-12 20:18:18	@Espyo	uhm
2016-05-12 20:18:21	@Espyo	it should be in English
2016-05-12 20:18:25	@Espyo	I don't know the menus by heart
2016-05-12 20:19:20	Marty2000	Its in "Config" or something similar
2016-05-12 20:19:24	Marty2000	It's*
2016-05-12 20:19:25	@Espyo	should be
2016-05-12 20:19:43	Klemen702	i checked
2016-05-12 20:19:50	Klemen702	can't find anything
2016-05-12 20:20:17	Marty2000	NES?
2016-05-12 20:26:32	Yoshi2	Klemen702: did you even try to look
2016-05-12 20:26:35	Yoshi2	http://www.noelshack.com/2016-19-1463081144-controls.png
2016-05-12 20:27:01	Yoshi2	input configuration
2016-05-12 20:28:47	Klemen702	i had no idea of using the word input
2016-05-12 20:29:05	Klemen702	<-- dumb retard being dumb :P
2016-05-12 20:29:07	Klemen702	also
2016-05-12 20:29:29	Klemen702	in this game i'm a tiger humanoid that is a robot fighting a robot that is made of 3 toilets, a brain and 2 balls 
2016-05-12 20:29:31	Klemen702	how dank is that
2016-05-12 20:29:37	Yoshi2	well, now you know that "Input" can mean controller input, ergo controls :P
2016-05-12 20:30:20	Yoshi2	and that is pretty dank
2016-05-12 20:31:17	Klemen702	also
2016-05-12 20:31:21	Klemen702	i can now play as that weird robot

2016-05-12 20:45:03	@Espyo	so, the Silencer as well?
2016-05-12 20:45:09	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 20:45:21	@Espyo	ok, so it's not just the Exploration Kit
2016-05-12 20:45:48	Marty2000	I guess it's for all treasures dropped on final sublevels
2016-05-12 20:45:55	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-12 20:46:02	Marty2000	But I'll continue verifying
2016-05-12 20:46:49	@Espyo	that is a good theory though
2016-05-12 20:47:16	Marty2000	I'm not sure for the Titan Dweevil, I'll check soon
2016-05-12 20:47:45	@Espyo	I think the Titan Dweevil too
2016-05-12 20:47:52	@Espyo	so, you're at the Wistful Wild
2016-05-12 20:48:03	@Espyo	can you check then if you can still get Louie's Notes without a Louie?
2016-05-12 20:48:24	Marty2000	Yes, once I get out of the Hole of Heroes
2016-05-12 20:48:39	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-12 20:49:18	Marty2000	I'll be honest, it'll take a long time though, because I need to destroy gates and I have only one Pikmin with me. Good thing I'm playing on two games at once
2016-05-12 20:49:27	Marty2000	It's faster
2016-05-12 20:49:27	@Espyo	haha
2016-05-12 20:49:30	@Espyo	now that's strategy
2016-05-12 20:50:21	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 20:52:26	Marty2000	Plus I have just noticed that you cannot attack gates with poison pipes if you haven't unlocked Whites (even with other types, and even by using a code that makes Pikmin invincible)
2016-05-12 20:52:35	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-12 20:52:45	@Espyo	...wow
2016-05-12 20:52:52	@Espyo	that NEEDS to be added to the article
2016-05-12 20:52:53	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-12 20:52:57	@Espyo	but that might be an NPC thing only
2016-05-12 20:53:02	Marty2000	No
2016-05-12 20:53:08	Marty2000	Gamecube version or Wii, that's the same
2016-05-12 20:53:16	@Espyo	I think I remember beating up the gas pipes next to the White Flower Garden
2016-05-12 20:53:19	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-05-12 20:53:29	Marty2000	You had probably unlocked Whites
2016-05-12 20:53:58	Marty2000	Other Pikmin can interact with those gates only when Whites were unlocked
2016-05-12 20:54:04	Marty2000	Strange thing... like many others
2016-05-12 20:55:49	Marty2000	Similarly, you cannot whistle Yellows until a certain gate is destroyed, and you cannot whistle Blues (Wii version only) until you've unlocked Yellows (but the gate doesn't need to be destroyed)

2016-05-12 21:00:06	Marty2000	Ooh
2016-05-12 21:00:16	Marty2000	I found a code hat I can use on Dolphin for the Gamecube version
2016-05-12 21:00:24	Marty2000	It allows Pikmin to destroy gates very quickly
2016-05-12 21:00:27	Marty2000	Great
2016-05-12 21:02:00	Marty2000	Also you can instantly kill enemies... good thing to gain time
2016-05-12 21:05:56	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Segmented_Crawbster#Trivia "It is also the only boss that Louie cannot be seen with."
2016-05-12 21:06:10	Marty2000	Yes that's true
2016-05-12 21:06:18	Marty2000	I was actually going to say "you can save Louie and"
2016-05-12 21:06:25	Marty2000	But... no
2016-05-12 21:06:28	@Espyo	right
2016-05-12 21:06:47	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-05-12 21:06:57	Marty2000	The code doesn't work for clogs, though...

2016-05-12 21:29:45	Marty2000	I have made a save by the way so I'll be able to tell you about Louie's notes
2016-05-12 21:29:50	Marty2000	savestate*
2016-05-12 21:42:48	Marty2000	Hmm... I'm not sure of something: I'll verify later, but it seems that in Pikmin 2, the bigger a Hermit Crawmad is, the closer a leader/Pikmin needs to be for the Crawmad to attack.
2016-05-12 21:45:55	Marty2000	Espyo, as I thought, our theory doesn't "work" with the treasures held by the Titan Dweevil
2016-05-12 21:46:02	Marty2000	So the latter might be an exception
2016-05-12 21:46:43	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-05-12 21:46:51	@Espyo	might just be a list of specific treasures
2016-05-12 21:47:24	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty#Reminder The list
2016-05-12 21:48:24	Marty2000	Going to try what you wanted to know about Louie's notes
2016-05-12 21:52:23	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-12 21:56:05	Marty2000	Does't change anything
2016-05-12 21:56:09	Marty2000	doesn't*

2016-05-12 22:29:58	@Espyo	and all articles about each relevant treasure
2016-05-12 22:30:12	@Espyo	it should go on the Did you know section of the front page, too
2016-05-12 22:30:16	@Espyo	and be tweeted and facebook'd
2016-05-12 22:30:21	@Espyo	but I'll handle those
2016-05-12 22:30:29	Marty2000	Ok
2016-05-12 22:30:47	Marty2000	I can add in the Treasure article and the other articles, though

2016-05-12 22:31:33	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-12 22:31:38	Marty2000	I think I can add it in Trivia
2016-05-12 22:31:43	Marty2000	Or new section?
2016-05-12 22:31:50	@Espyo	probably a new section
2016-05-12 22:31:54	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-12 22:31:56	@Espyo	since we should have a list

2016-05-12 22:32:10	@Espyo	like, on some other article
2016-05-12 22:32:19	@Espyo	we might need to mention that some treasures change weight as a mechanic
2016-05-12 22:32:27	@Espyo	and we can link to that section on the Treasure article right away
2016-05-12 22:32:46	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 22:33:05	@Espyo	other than that, you should add the info on how the gas pipes can't be damaged before Whites, and that Louie's notes can still be obtained without Louie

2016-05-12 22:47:14	Yoshi2|offline	klemen should learn to remind himself tbh
2016-05-12 22:47:15	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-05-12 22:47:40	Yoshi2|offline	what's so difficult about taking a piece of paper, writing the task on it and putting it on your monitor
2016-05-12 22:48:03	Marty2000	Maybe he'll forget that he wrote what he had to do... ;)
2016-05-12 22:54:52	Marty2000	"Louie's notes can still be obtained without Louie" You need to defeat the Titan Dweevil to get Louie's notes
2016-05-12 22:55:13	Marty2000	But it's still possible to get new entries without him
2016-05-12 22:55:18	Marty2000	If that's what you meant
2016-05-12 22:58:41	@Espyo	wait
2016-05-12 22:58:48	@Espyo	so you DO need to get Louie back before you get the notes?
2016-05-12 22:58:59	Marty2000	I think so
2016-05-12 22:59:23	Marty2000	I thought you were talking about discovering new enemies
2016-05-12 22:59:30	Marty2000	...Sorry. 
2016-05-12 23:00:07	@Espyo	I just want to know everything about the Louie's Notes mechanic when Louie is absent
2016-05-12 23:00:29	@Espyo	so, what happens if you touch a new enemy when Louie is not around, basically
2016-05-12 23:00:42	@Espyo	you can still access old notes when Louie's absent, right?
2016-05-12 23:01:11	Marty2000	Old notes? You mean, his notes? 
2016-05-12 23:01:28	@Espyo	notes he wrote before being left behind
2016-05-12 23:01:58	Marty2000	I don't think he can write notes before being left behind... but if that's the case, yes, you can access these notes and have new ones
2016-05-12 23:02:28	@Espyo	I'm so confused...
2016-05-12 23:03:10	@Espyo	ok, so
2016-05-12 23:03:23	@Espyo	if you touch a Dwarf Orange Bulborb on the Emergence Cave on day 2
2016-05-12 23:03:29	@Espyo	at the end of the day, you go to the Piklopedia
2016-05-12 23:03:39	@Espyo	you can see Louie's Notes on the DRB, right?
2016-05-12 23:03:49	Marty2000	Actually, that's maybe more complicated than that. I'm verifying something
2016-05-12 23:04:06	Marty2000	Yes or no, depending on something that I'm verifying
2016-05-12 23:04:13	@Espyo	w-wha...
2016-05-12 23:04:46	Marty2000	I remembersomething I saw on a French forum a long time ago
2016-05-12 23:04:57	Marty2000	So look at that:
2016-05-12 23:05:02	Marty2000	The first time you play the game
2016-05-12 23:05:11	Marty2000	(without having started any save!)
2016-05-12 23:05:17	Marty2000	You don't have Louie's notes
2016-05-12 23:05:25	Marty2000	You have them after beating the Titan Dweevil
2016-05-12 23:05:36	Marty2000	However, it also unlocks them for all the other saves
2016-05-12 23:05:53	Marty2000	I remember that now
2016-05-12 23:06:22	@Espyo	I have a friend next to me
2016-05-12 23:06:27	@Espyo	he's saying "yeah, that's right"
2016-05-12 23:06:52	Marty2000	Hmm
2016-05-12 23:07:01	Marty2000	Thanks Espyo's friend
2016-05-12 23:07:32	Marty2000	 I don't think this is on Pikipedia, by the way
2016-05-12 23:07:37	Marty2000	I'm checking
2016-05-12 23:07:38	@Espyo	it really isn't
2016-05-12 23:07:39	@Espyo	this is news to me
2016-05-12 23:07:48	@Espyo	what about Olimar's Notes?
2016-05-12 23:07:54	@Espyo	and Olimar's Journal? and Sales Pitches?

2016-05-12 23:10:42	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-12 23:10:50	@Espyo	you have file 1 with the Dream Den
2016-05-12 23:10:56	@Espyo	file 2 with like day 3
2016-05-12 23:11:01	@Espyo	file 3 empty
2016-05-12 23:11:09	@Espyo	you defeat the Titan Dweevil on file 1
2016-05-12 23:11:19	@Espyo	you're telling me that unlocks Louie's Notes for files 1 and 2
2016-05-12 23:11:27	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 23:11:37	@Espyo	what about file 3? if you play file 3 until day 3, do you get to see Louie's Notes as you touch enemies?
2016-05-12 23:11:40	Marty2000	And for all other subsequent saves, even if the first ones got deleted
2016-05-12 23:11:44	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 23:11:54	@Espyo	ok, I see
2016-05-12 23:11:58	@Espyo	that explains so much
2016-05-12 23:12:07	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-12 23:12:40	@Espyo	ok, and what if, after Louie's Notes have been universally unlocked, you go play a save, go up until you lose Louie, and get a new enemy
2016-05-12 23:12:57	@Espyo	will it still unlock the enemy its Louie's Notes on that file?
2016-05-12 23:13:11	Marty2000	You will get his notes and unlock the enemy in the Piklopedia
2016-05-12 23:13:20	@Espyo	I ask because, since Louie is kidnapped in that save file, it doesn't make much sense for that save file to get notes
2016-05-12 23:13:26	Marty2000	I could try this with my GameCube save when you asked me to try that
2016-05-12 23:13:28	@Espyo	since, on that file, Louie wouldn't be there to write them
2016-05-12 23:13:33	@Espyo	no, no need, I think
2016-05-12 23:13:37	Marty2000	Yes, but you still get them
2016-05-12 23:13:45	@Espyo	all right, it's all making sense
2016-05-12 23:13:46	Marty2000	I was able* if you prefer
2016-05-12 23:13:51	@Espyo	oh, one last detail, if you know
2016-05-12 23:14:08	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-05-12 23:14:13	@Espyo	you unlock them by defeating the Titan Dweevil... or by carrying The King of Bugs to the research pod?
2016-05-12 23:14:30	Marty2000	Hmm... I don't know about this
2016-05-12 23:14:38	@Espyo	it might be the latter
2016-05-12 23:14:43	@Espyo	that'll be interesting to check on day
2016-05-12 23:14:45	@Espyo	*one
2016-05-12 23:14:50	@Espyo	but I see
2016-05-12 23:14:59	@Espyo	I'll edit Louie's Notes' article to reflect all of this
2016-05-12 23:15:01	Marty2000	I'll check tomorrow by deleting my Gamecube save on Dolphin
2016-05-12 23:15:01	@Espyo	so that it is clear
2016-05-12 23:15:06	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-12 23:15:14	@Espyo	you can just move it to the B-slot memory card
2016-05-12 23:15:20	@Espyo	instead of deleting it forever
2016-05-12 23:15:20	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-12 23:15:23	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-12 23:15:30	Marty2000	Didn't realize
2016-05-12 23:15:43	@Espyo	the game only reads memory card A
2016-05-12 23:16:10	@Espyo	you'll still have to play story mode again until the Dream Den... are you sure you want to do this?
2016-05-12 23:16:24	Marty2000	Doesn't bother...
2016-05-12 23:16:40	@Espyo	if you want to help the wiki, that's awesome, but I don't want you to do something painfully boring just to figure out one tiny thing
2016-05-12 23:16:49	Marty2000	Another funny discovery, since it's our main topic:
2016-05-12 23:16:57	Marty2000	(It's okay, don't worryà
2016-05-12 23:16:59	Marty2000	)
2016-05-12 23:17:01	Marty2000	So
2016-05-12 23:17:08	@Espyo	(all right, thanks for checking!)
2016-05-12 23:17:19	Marty2000	You know, when you land on the last sublevel of a cave
2016-05-12 23:17:33	Marty2000	A message shows up : Final level or something similar
2016-05-12 23:17:36	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-12 23:17:51	Marty2000	You cannot dismiss while the message is on screen
2016-05-12 23:17:57	Marty2000	But only in Story Mode
2016-05-12 23:18:07	Marty2000	It's still possible in Challenge Mode
2016-05-12 23:18:49	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-12 23:18:54	@Espyo	I think I remember that
2016-05-12 23:19:05	@Espyo	falling down a sublevel is just annoying in general, in my opinion...
2016-05-12 23:19:11	@Espyo	it takes so long before you can finally whistle
2016-05-12 23:19:20	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-12 23:19:28	@Espyo	if you want to move forward without any Pikmin, that might be impossible, since you always end up touching sme
2016-05-12 23:19:29	@Espyo	*some
2016-05-12 23:19:31	Marty2000	And it takes so long before you can move the cursor in the Wii version :/
2016-05-12 23:19:34	@Espyo	it's kinda sucky
2016-05-12 23:19:36	@Espyo	ouch
2016-05-12 23:22:00	@Espyo	ok, so is the Sales Pitch the same way or not?
2016-05-12 23:22:08	Marty2000	Nope
2016-05-12 23:22:26	Marty2000	You can have them in file 1 and not in file 2
2016-05-12 23:22:32	@Espyo	right
2016-05-12 23:22:36	@Espyo	what triggers their unlocking?
2016-05-12 23:22:59	Marty2000	I think you can unlock them when having all the treasures of a set
2016-05-12 23:23:22	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-05-12 23:23:25	@Espyo	you just get a series
2016-05-12 23:23:27	Marty2000	And it only unlocks these pitches for the treasure in that set
2016-05-12 23:23:33	@Espyo	and you unlock all pitches for those treasures
2016-05-12 23:23:46	Marty2000	I think so
2016-05-12 23:27:03	@Espyo	there... I elaborated on the unlocking mechanism
2016-05-12 23:27:07	@Espyo	there should be no more confusion now
2016-05-12 23:27:54	Marty2000	I see

2016-05-13 12:55:22	Marty2000	Yep, I'm using Chrome, but it worked when I cleared my history... Strange, but well, the problem is solved. Thanks Internet and thank you for telling me (otherwise I would have waited for hours)

2016-05-13 16:20:32	Marty2000	Yes, European... but is your game set to German?
2016-05-13 16:20:49	Marty2000	Mine was set to English, but I changed the language for the aforementioned reasons

2016-05-13 18:43:25	Klemen702	it's just that if you get too close the gravity will be so strong that you can't escape

2016-05-13 21:50:36	@Espyo	...wow
2016-05-13 21:51:58	Marty2000	I'll look for more information about that, but it'll take some time (takes four minutes to change the language)
2016-05-13 21:52:18	Marty2000	By the way I made a montage so we have English text on my Secret File 0

2016-05-13 21:55:16	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-13 21:55:22	@Espyo	and yeah, I remember changing languages on Smash to check something
2016-05-13 21:55:25	@Espyo	it's so quick on the 3DS
2016-05-13 21:55:31	@Espyo	Wii U, not so much...
2016-05-13 21:55:52	Marty2000	Ah, I have maybe understood... If it changes depending on the language
2016-05-13 21:56:05	Marty2000	It's maybe due to the reward's language!
2016-05-13 21:56:15	Marty2000	The videos are available in several languages
2016-05-13 21:57:07	Marty2000	Yes, it's so slow... :/
2016-05-13 21:57:09	@Espyo	oh, are they?
2016-05-13 21:57:13	@Espyo	that's likely it, then
2016-05-13 21:58:11	Marty2000	Well, I'm not 100% sure, but I remember watching one of those videos in French
2016-05-13 21:58:51	@Espyo	just the subtitles, or Olimar too?
2016-05-13 21:58:59	Marty2000	Subtitles
2016-05-13 21:59:04	@Espyo	right
2016-05-13 21:59:09	Marty2000	Olimar doesn't speak any known language, does he?
2016-05-13 21:59:30	@Espyo	oh...
2016-05-13 21:59:32	@Espyo	of course not
2016-05-13 21:59:36	@Espyo	that was stupid of me

2016-05-13 22:05:48	@Espyo	ok, so the digits don't just rotate
2016-05-13 22:05:57	@Espyo	there are unique codes for every region and for every video
2016-05-13 22:06:00	@Espyo	we need to get all of these
2016-05-13 22:06:04	Marty2000	Four digits appear twice in each language, by the way
2016-05-13 22:06:04	@Espyo	the game files might contain them
2016-05-13 22:06:08	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-13 22:06:11	@Espyo	didn't notice
2016-05-13 22:06:21	@Espyo	all of this needs to be added to the article
2016-05-13 22:06:33	Marty2000	Yep, I'll do
2016-05-13 22:06:35	@Espyo	 1) the codes are actually made up of four digits that repeat twice
2016-05-13 22:06:46	@Espyo	 2) each language has its own codes, which can be seen by changing languages
2016-05-13 22:07:07	Marty2000	I wonder if we get the same videos with this changing code
2016-05-13 22:07:10	Marty2000	I'll try right now
2016-05-13 22:07:14	@Espyo	 3) each language's code list is unique (i.e. there's no pattern to convert codes from one language to another)
2016-05-13 22:07:24	@Espyo	probably, but go for it

2016-05-13 22:36:53	En_Passant	What's our policy on Japanese images?
2016-05-13 22:38:07	Marty2000	I think that the Policy on images is general and that there's no section dedicated to Japanese ones
2016-05-13 22:38:50	Marty2000	I'm not sure, though
2016-05-13 22:39:20	@Espyo	no policy
2016-05-13 22:39:27	@Espyo	what kind of policies were you expecting?
2016-05-13 22:39:59	En_Passant	One that lets me know if I should delete images from the merge that are in Japanese
2016-05-13 22:41:38	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Japanese That's the only thing about Japanese things
2016-05-13 22:42:25	Marty2000	Other than the Japanese Pikmin games are not considered as cannon as the American ones
2016-05-13 22:43:27	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-13 22:43:38	@Espyo	well, in general, we consider American more canon that European
2016-05-13 22:43:43	@Espyo	and European more than Japanese
2016-05-13 22:43:47	@Espyo	so we prefer English whenever possible
2016-05-13 22:43:50	@Espyo	this goes for images too
2016-05-13 22:43:55	Marty2000	Yep, I saw that too

2016-05-13 22:45:52	En_Passant	That's what I figured, but I wanted to make sure
2016-05-13 22:48:15	@Espyo	if we don't have an image about the same thing in English, then it should be kept
2016-05-13 22:48:19	@Espyo	Japanese is better than nothing

2016-05-13 22:58:12	Marty2000	I'll be honest, the only images I have a problme with is those uploaded by TabuuandPeach. That's just my opinion, I am not here to tell what to do... but I think that his screenshots of Burping Bulborbs are useless because we have already some. Most of the screenshots he uploads are duplications. Maybe I haven't understood, in which case I'm sorry

2016-05-13 22:59:41	En_Passant	If they're duplicates, mark them for deletion

2016-05-13 23:00:25	@Espyo	if he uploads any more burping images

2016-05-13 23:04:38	Marty2000	It's maybe not useless
2016-05-13 23:04:44	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-13 23:04:58	Marty2000	But I'm sure we can upload images of other things that the article does not have, instead
2016-05-13 23:08:46	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-13 23:37:04	En_Passant	tfw you get through 50 images from the merge and realize you forgot to categorize any of the ones you kept

2016-05-14 11:10:22	Yoshi2	yup, it's good because there are tools people wrote to convert sounds into that
2016-05-14 11:13:22	Marty2000	He he, great
2016-05-14 12:30:03	Yoshi2	the main issue is figuring out the limits for custom sounds/music
2016-05-14 12:54:34	Marty2000	Yeah...
2016-05-14 12:54:55	Marty2000	What kind of limits are there?
2016-05-14 12:55:40	Yoshi2	not sure yet, that's what I am trying to figure out
2016-05-14 12:55:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-14 12:56:09	Yoshi2	I do have a few results so far
2016-05-14 12:56:20	Yoshi2	custom music longer than original music = doesn't play
2016-05-14 12:56:32	Yoshi2	custom music about as long as original music = plays
2016-05-14 12:56:39	Marty2000	I see, they must have the same size, more or less
2016-05-14 12:56:49	Yoshi2	now checking custom music that is shorter
2016-05-14 12:58:10	Marty2000	It's similar to changing the name of the caves in Pikmin 2: if you do so, the new names must contain the same number of letters as the original ones
2016-05-14 12:58:14	Marty2000	Otherwise the game crashes
2016-05-14 12:58:33	Marty2000	Well, it's not the same kind of hack
2016-05-14 12:58:40	Marty2000	But the way it works seems similar
2016-05-14 12:59:11	Yoshi2	shorter music doesn't play again
2016-05-14 12:59:22	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-14 13:02:51	Yoshi2	so next I have to check how close I can be to the original length for it to play
2016-05-14 13:09:55	Yoshi2	the other annoying aspect is the time it takes for encoding to finish
2016-05-14 13:10:10	Marty2000	Hmm
2016-05-14 13:11:13	Yoshi2	4 times the length of the music piece, and double that if you are converting stereo music
2016-05-14 13:11:55	Marty2000	Lol... Reminds me Youtube and my recorder
2016-05-14 13:12:15	Marty2000	I need hours to upload a little video, sometimes
2016-05-14 13:12:21	Marty2000	It's probably because of the format
2016-05-14 13:12:39	Marty2000	MPEG-2 TS (.ts)
2016-05-14 13:12:59	Marty2000	And if I ever try to convert... I lose a lot of quality, even when choosing HD
2016-05-14 13:13:46	Yoshi2	I use ffmpeg for encoding the videos I record in dolphin
2016-05-14 13:14:02	Marty2000	Oh, those are not videos from Dolphin
2016-05-14 13:14:11	Marty2000	I have never tried recording with Dolphin
2016-05-14 13:14:42	Marty2000	I should. Are the videos large in term of size?
2016-05-14 13:15:03	Marty2000	I don't have much space...
2016-05-14 13:15:36	Yoshi2	mp4 container, h264 for video, ogg for audio, recently got 13 minutes down to 300 mb which took an hour to upload
2016-05-14 13:15:53	Yoshi2	whether they are large or not depends on codecs dolphin is set up to use
2016-05-14 13:15:56	Marty2000	Oh, that's good size
2016-05-14 13:16:15	Marty2000	13 minutes of video with my recorder = more than 1 Gb easily
2016-05-14 13:17:08	Yoshi2	that same video was 1-2 gb when I finished recording on linux, my dolphin auto-compressed it with some high bitrate codec
2016-05-14 13:17:45	Yoshi2	on windows I didn't set up any codecs so for the best quality I just decided to do uncompressed
2016-05-14 13:17:54	Yoshi2	lots and lots of gb for 10 minutes of footage
2016-05-14 13:17:55	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-14 13:19:06	Yoshi2	I'd always let dolphin record in the best possible quality, then get that down to something nice
2016-05-14 13:19:29	Yoshi2	if you have high quality footage you can always make lower quality footage out of that, but the reverse isn't possible
2016-05-14 13:19:50	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-14 13:24:49	Yoshi2	hmm, one minute of levan polkka was too much for the game, I guess it needs to be exactly 43 seconds (original length of the music piece I'm replacing)
2016-05-14 13:25:11	Marty2000	I think so too
2016-05-14 13:26:11	Marty2000	As I said, it must be the same as Pikmin 2: if you hack, I guess you need the same size for the new file
2016-05-14 13:26:21	Marty2000	I suppose it's the same for plenty of other games
2016-05-14 13:26:45	Marty2000	I remember it's similar for SOnic Heroes too, if you have already played that game
2016-05-14 13:26:49	Marty2000	SOnic*
2016-05-14 13:26:52	Marty2000	Sonic*
2016-05-14 13:27:04	Yoshi2	not the exact same size, there is some leeway
2016-05-14 13:27:12	Marty2000	Yes, but roughly
2016-05-14 13:34:14	Yoshi2	it's not a file size limit, it really seems to be bound to the length of the music piece
2016-05-14 13:35:15	Marty2000	Did you try to take the same song and change its size if possible? If so, then it's very likely the length of it, as you say
2016-05-14 13:36:55	Yoshi2	I tried a song that, after trimming, was 1 MB instead of 0.7 MB like the original file
2016-05-14 13:37:33	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-14 13:40:47	@J	for file sizes, it entirely depends how you're changing the files
2016-05-14 13:40:59	Marty2000	Hi J
2016-05-14 13:41:05	@J	it's possible to add any amount of data and have it still valid, you just have to move the files around on disk
2016-05-14 13:41:09	-->	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-14 13:42:09	Yoshi2	J: yup, I'm letting GCRebuilder deal with that
2016-05-14 13:43:52	@J	yep, you need a tool that rebuilds the whole disk, or Dolphin playing directly from the extracted files, or I believe my tool is still the only one that allows partial disk updates with arbitrary file size increases
2016-05-14 13:45:58	Yoshi2	I haven't managed to get dolphin playing directly from the extracted files to work yet, but that would be perfect because quite a lot of time goes into rebuilding the image
2016-05-14 13:46:34	@J	are you working on Windows or Linux now?
2016-05-14 13:47:39	@J	(on Wii games?)
2016-05-14 13:47:49	Yoshi2	windows right now, though linux is an option
2016-05-14 13:48:17	Yoshi2	GC games and Wii games
2016-05-14 13:50:03	Yoshi2	Marty2000: oooo I pushed the limits of the file to 47 seconds instead of the original 45
2016-05-14 13:50:24	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-05-14 13:51:22	Yoshi2	now going to push it to 50 seconds
2016-05-14 13:51:33	Marty2000	That'd be cool
2016-05-14 13:51:48	@J	if you are doing GC on Linux, GCEdit should work well and be much faster
2016-05-14 13:52:04	@J	otherwise, I do still have plans one day to have Windows and Wii support, but I am super lazy
2016-05-14 13:52:18	@J	actually the laziest of people
2016-05-14 13:52:30	Yoshi2	I'll find out if the way the game handles looping depends on the length of the music or if it is hardcoded
2016-05-14 13:53:00	@J	the music length limit thing sounds weird
2016-05-14 13:53:04	Yoshi2	J: can it rebuild from a file directory or do I have to deal with the GUI?
2016-05-14 13:53:09	@J	that you can slightly increase it, but no more than that
2016-05-14 13:53:34	@J	it's just a GUI, you click import, choose your file/directory, then click write
2016-05-14 13:54:07	@J	but there is a Python library for doing the important part, shouldn't be hard to write a script to take a couple of arguments indicating what to do
2016-05-14 13:55:50	Yoshi2	are you telling me i have to personally put effort into that
2016-05-14 13:55:54	Yoshi2	noooooo waaaaaaay
2016-05-14 13:56:32	@J	hey, the amount of effort you put into the audio stuff
2016-05-14 13:58:05	Yoshi2	the audio stuff is pretty much fire-and-forget though so I can watch youtube videos while this audacity fork with dsp support takes ages to convert the audio into dsp
2016-05-14 13:59:07	@J	I would actually like a CLI; I promise to take a look at making a basic one, shouldn't take long at all
2016-05-14 14:01:43	@J	something like 'gcedit-cli rm -r disk.iso some/dir', 'gcedit-cli import -r disk.iso my/updates destination/dir'
2016-05-14 14:02:54	Yoshi2	I'm a pretty big fan of wiimms tools due to its cli, but it can't make GC images
2016-05-14 14:12:03	Yoshi2	Marty2000: ok, 50 seconds is too much again
2016-05-14 14:12:16	Yoshi2	time to go below the original time
2016-05-14 14:12:30	Marty2000	Ah :/
2016-05-14 14:12:53	Yoshi2	from this I can make a few theories about custom music in the game
2016-05-14 14:13:51	Yoshi2	after that, I'll be dealing with custom voice acting
2016-05-14 14:31:17	Yoshi2	ok, 5 seconds below the original time is also not ok
2016-05-14 14:33:20	Marty2000	Ok
2016-05-14 14:37:06	Yoshi2	now I copy&pasted some of the sound to bring the file back to the original 45 seconds
2016-05-14 14:40:19	Marty2000	Works now, right?
2016-05-14 14:41:43	Yoshi2	I'm checking that now
2016-05-14 14:44:31	Yoshi2	Marty2000: yep, works again
2016-05-14 14:45:26	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-14 14:45:30	Yoshi2	now I will record my own voice for 50 seconds and see if that works as music replacement
2016-05-14 14:45:35	Yoshi2	my voice should make the file smaller
2016-05-14 14:48:42	UltraMario	yoshi2 is in a game?

2016-05-14 15:09:39	Marty2000	Good
2016-05-14 15:09:51	Yoshi2	one is bad voice acting from skyrim, another is me bricking my wii
2016-05-14 15:10:04	Yoshi2	effort put into those videos = 0
2016-05-14 15:10:10	Marty2000	I watched the later
2016-05-14 15:11:07	Yoshi2	I rewatched the wii brick video again to make sure it contained no personal information or sounds
2016-05-14 15:11:13	Yoshi2	suprisingly, it didn#t
2016-05-14 15:11:23	Yoshi2	young me did a pretty good job in that aspect

2016-05-14 15:18:08	Yoshi2	the brick video was from 2010
2016-05-14 15:18:17	UltraMario	old
2016-05-14 15:18:23	Yoshi2	that means I was 14 or so
2016-05-14 15:18:36	Yoshi2	and um was cute 10 years old

2016-05-14 15:20:34	Marty2000	I like maths, but I prefer languages
2016-05-14 15:20:42	Yoshi2	hi espyo
2016-05-14 15:20:42	Marty2000	Hey Espyo
2016-05-14 15:20:45	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-14 15:21:08	Yoshi2	where were you when I bricked my wii and made a video about it 6 years ago
2016-05-14 15:26:56	Yoshi2	I guess that question was too random
2016-05-14 15:33:19	Yoshi2	interesting, I recorded my voice now and it wasn't really smaller in file size when I encoded it in dsp
2016-05-14 15:33:41	Marty2000	I see...
2016-05-14 15:36:40	Yoshi2	I resampled it with 24k hz now, let's see how the file size changes now
2016-05-14 15:43:51	Yoshi2	that halved the size bringing it close to what the original file was, but the file doesn't play because it has a longer playtime
2016-05-14 15:44:05	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-14 15:44:13	Yoshi2	so I'm fairly sure filesize has no effect on whether the music plays or not, it is purely the length of the music
2016-05-14 15:44:23	Marty2000	Yep, I think so
2016-05-14 15:44:58	UltraMario	did you make it into the game yoshi2
2016-05-14 15:44:59	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-14 15:45:25	Yoshi2	no, my recording was too long so I'd have to cut it
2016-05-14 15:45:36	Yoshi2	but I did make it into the game yesterday when I was replacing voice lines
2016-05-14 15:45:46	UltraMario	;-;
2016-05-14 15:46:44	Yoshi2	and no worries um, I will get some cool stuff working when I know more about the behaviour of the game
2016-05-14 15:46:59	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-14 15:54:05	Marty2000	I've just got rekt
2016-05-14 15:54:25	Marty2000	I downloaded Pikmin 2 (USA) to find the French names of the treasures and enemies
2016-05-14 15:54:32	Marty2000	To see if they were the same
2016-05-14 15:54:39	Marty2000	But... there's no French in it
2016-05-14 15:54:51	Marty2000	I guess it's exclusive to the NPC version :/
2016-05-14 15:55:07	Yoshi2	why would USA have French names
2016-05-14 15:55:23	Marty2000	American games also have French language as an option
2016-05-14 15:55:45	Marty2000	I don't know if it was the case for Gamecube games
2016-05-14 15:56:33	Marty2000	And if you are wondering why I want French in an American version
2016-05-14 15:56:53	Marty2000	It's because it's very different from the French names of France
2016-05-14 15:56:56	Marty2000	As an example,
2016-05-14 15:57:07	Marty2000	Every weapon in Splatoon has a different name
2016-05-14 15:57:35	Marty2000	So I guess it's the same for games like Pikmin 2
2016-05-14 15:57:59	Yoshi2	but there is
2016-05-14 15:58:08	Yoshi2	quite a time difference
2016-05-14 15:58:13	Yoshi2	between splatoon and pikmin 2
2016-05-14 15:58:20	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-05-14 15:58:25	Marty2000	It's the same for some Wii games
2016-05-14 15:58:43	Marty2000	(wonder if it's not all of them)
2016-05-14 15:58:46	Yoshi2	I don't see french language options in super mario sunshine
2016-05-14 15:59:08	Marty2000	I guess it wasn't an option for Gamecube games
2016-05-14 16:00:33	Marty2000	It's also the same for Spanish (Eu) and Spanish (US)
2016-05-14 16:02:42	Marty2000	Look, that's why I'm looking for the American version with French:
2016-05-14 16:02:55	Marty2000	Europe: Pellet POsy=Fleur-palet (Flower Pellet)

2016-05-14 16:03:21	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-14 16:15:40	Marty2000	Well, I have at least the manual of the American version of NPC P2
2016-05-14 16:15:44	Marty2000	And as I suspected
2016-05-14 16:15:50	Marty2000	Nearly every name is different...
2016-05-14 16:25:29	Marty2000	I'll try to download the Wii version it and make it work on Dolphin

2016-05-14 16:27:41	UltraMario	because emulation

2016-05-14 16:28:47	Marty2000	Yes but
2016-05-14 16:28:59	Marty2000	I only need to unlock the Piklopedia entries
2016-05-14 16:29:02	Marty2000	And treasures
2016-05-14 16:29:11	Marty2000	I don't care about the rest ;)
2016-05-14 16:29:26	Marty2000	I'm sure there are codes for that
2016-05-14 17:16:20	Marty2000	Well, I found it (WBSF) in 5 parts. I guess it's still possible to run it on Dolphin even if the format is WBSF, right?
2016-05-14 17:20:13	Marty2000	I have to download it first, anyway

2016-05-14 17:52:32	@J	/home/j/Documents/Coding/projects/in progress/gcedit/src/gceditcli/command/ls.py
2016-05-14 17:52:38	@J	uh...wrong clipboard I guess
2016-05-14 17:52:44	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/gcedit-cli.zip
2016-05-14 17:53:03	@J	Yoshi2: didn't take too long to get something working, give it a go if you want
2016-05-14 17:54:14	@J	not much documentation, run 'gcedit-cli' with Python 3; you should be able to follow the help by passing -h, then 'gcedit-cli ls -h', etc.
2016-05-14 17:54:33	@J	...and always make backups
2016-05-14 17:57:33	Yoshi2	J: oooh, thanks, I'll give it a try when I get network sharing set up in linux
2016-05-14 18:00:07	@J	should work on Windows too
2016-05-14 18:01:35	@J	though I'm not entirely sure from what you said that you were thinking it wouldn't
2016-05-14 18:02:00	Yoshi2	you said something about your GUI working better on linux
2016-05-14 18:03:49	Yoshi2	but I guess the CLI is pure python, so it should work on windows
2016-05-14 18:05:07	@J	the issue with the GUI on Windows is that GTK3 doesn't work properly on Windows
2016-05-14 18:05:18	@J	there's a bug where when you move or resize the window, it crashes
2016-05-14 18:05:47	@J	I assume that's still the case, haven't tested for a few months
2016-05-14 18:11:56	Yoshi2	I am slightly bothered by how gcedit-cli is a python file, but does not have the python ending
2016-05-14 18:12:08	Yoshi2	but that probably makes it stand out from the gcutil.py in the same directory
2016-05-14 18:13:53	@J	it's pretty standard practice on Linux to remove the extension from entry-point files for scripting languages
2016-05-14 18:14:13	@J	then you make it executable and place the #! line at the top to indicate what program to execute it with
2016-05-14 18:14:49	@J	obviously I would package this up into an exe on Windows at some point
2016-05-14 18:15:26	Yoshi2	J: what is disk and source in the import command?
2016-05-14 18:19:59	Yoshi2	my guess is that disk is the path to the original image, source is my directory with all the files and dest is the destination of the new image
2016-05-14 18:20:08	Yoshi2	not sure how close I am to the truth though
2016-05-14 18:20:46	@J	almost
2016-05-14 18:21:00	@J	destination is the path within the disk to put the files
2016-05-14 18:21:06	@J	it modifies an existing disk
2016-05-14 18:21:43	@J	so your destination path might be (for Pikmin 2) 'user/Abe/stages.txt'
2016-05-14 18:23:36	Yoshi2	oh

2016-05-14 18:29:04	Yoshi3	<Yoshi2> J: what would I put if I wanted to put the files in the root of the disc?
2016-05-14 18:29:22	Yoshi3	my guess would be the empty path
2016-05-14 18:30:29	Yoshi3	or "."
2016-05-14 18:31:01	@J	it takes the single file or directory you specify and puts it where you specify
2016-05-14 18:31:38	@J	as in, it's not like 'cp' - if you set 'dest' to 'a' and 'a' already exists as a directory, it will fail because of that unless you pass -f

2016-05-14 18:32:47	@J	[18:31:01] @J it takes the single file or directory you specify and puts it where you specify
2016-05-14 18:32:47	@J	[18:31:38] @J as in, it's not like 'cp' - if you set 'dest' to 'a' and 'a' already exists as a directory, it will fail because of that unless you pass -f
2016-05-14 18:32:50	@J	so you only need to specify the root as the destination if you want to replace everything in the disk with a local directory
2016-05-14 18:33:23	@J	if you want to put a file in the root, do do 'gcedit-cli import disk.iso my/file.txt destination.txt'
2016-05-14 18:33:30	@J	or /destination.txt work
2016-05-14 18:33:31	@J	s
2016-05-14 18:34:24	Marty2000	Hmm... What do you think should be added, En_Passant?
2016-05-14 18:34:26	Marty2000	Hi, by the way
2016-05-14 18:34:34	Yoshi3	alright
2016-05-14 18:34:43	Yoshi3	I think I got something that might work
2016-05-14 18:34:49	En_Passant	The Armored Mawdad one doesn't say where they are
2016-05-14 18:35:18	En_Passant	Idk if we're trying to avoid being a guide here
2016-05-14 18:36:10	Marty2000	Hmm... I suppose we should add the locations in the Armored Mawdad's article, but I don't really know either, to be honest

2016-05-14 18:40:51	Yoshi2	first test did not work, hmmmmmmmm
2016-05-14 18:45:38	Yoshi2	J: do you see anything particulary wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/raw/5MG7DhtT
2016-05-14 18:46:10	Yoshi2	a bat file I made so I can rebuild the image with one click
2016-05-14 18:47:30	Yoshi2	gcedit-cli is in gcedit-cli\gcedit-cli, the image I want to modify is on E:, I have the modified files in a directory called "BattalionWars1_Files_Modding\root\Data" and want to put that into the Data directory of the image
2016-05-14 18:48:00	Yoshi2	it runs through and creates an image, but the image does not run in dolphin
2016-05-14 18:49:13	Yoshi2	dolphin's logs say APPLOADER ERROR, FSTLength(116348) in BB2 is greater than FSTMaxLength(115646)
2016-05-14 18:50:37	Yoshi2	I could try to delete some files that aren't necessary and see if that changes anything
2016-05-14 18:50:52	@J	this is GC, right?
2016-05-14 18:50:56	Yoshi2	yes
2016-05-14 18:51:24	@J	oh, that error is interesting, never seen that
2016-05-14 18:51:29	@J	yeah, maybe delete some files
2016-05-14 18:51:41	@J	seems to be saying there's too many, though I'm not sure where it's getting the limit
2016-05-14 18:51:55	@J	got to attend to cooking, I'll take a look later
2016-05-14 18:52:10	Yoshi2	I never had the issue of too many files with GCRebuilder so I am a bit confused, but maybe gcrebuilder does something you don't
2016-05-14 18:55:40	@J	it's possible, maybe all the games I've tried have fstmaxlength set much higher than the actual fst size
2016-05-14 18:58:57	Yoshi2	I wonder if there is any way to set FSTMaxLength to something higher
2016-05-14 18:59:40	Yoshi2	I have this feeling that I will never get FSTLength below the maximum even after deleting some junk I left in the directory
2016-05-14 19:00:46	Yoshi2	115923, still 300 units away from the max
2016-05-14 19:01:48	Yoshi2	I have a different folder containing unmodified files, I wonder if that one works
2016-05-14 19:01:52	@J	a quick look showed it's on the disk, check what's at 0x8000003c if you have a hex editor
2016-05-14 19:03:40	@J	oh, ignore that
2016-05-14 19:03:48	@J	I didn't look properly
2016-05-14 19:03:52	Yoshi2	the offsets don't go that far
2016-05-14 19:05:39	Yoshi2	the unmodified folder did work, so your code is not broken
2016-05-14 19:06:02	@J	hmm, okay
2016-05-14 19:08:03	Yoshi2	and it does feel like gcedit is faster than gcrebuilder, so would it be awesome if it somehow could be made to work in this case

2016-05-14 19:28:43	@J	I also replaced it in the download
2016-05-14 19:28:44	@J	same link
2016-05-14 19:29:38	Yoshi2	ok, I'm giving it a try
2016-05-14 19:29:54	@J	Espyo: I made a quick CLI for gcedit
2016-05-14 19:30:06	@J	or rather, it doesn't involve gcedit at all, just uses the same gcutil library
2016-05-14 19:30:16	Yoshi2	and the CLI is pretty hype
2016-05-14 19:32:32	Yoshi2	a progress bar would be cool though
2016-05-14 19:33:30	@J	the library does have progress support, but it would take a bit of work hooking it up and rendering it
2016-05-14 19:33:34	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-05-14 19:33:47	@J	normally you're not copying files large enough that it matters though
2016-05-14 19:33:55	@J	my tests were generally running in 0.3s
2016-05-14 19:33:58	Yoshi2	I'd be happy enough if it just wrote a message every X %
2016-05-14 19:35:01	Yoshi2	well, it isn't that important, it seems to finish quick enough anyway
2016-05-14 19:35:55	Yoshi2	J: it works now!
2016-05-14 19:44:01	@J	great
2016-05-14 19:48:51	Yoshi2	J: where do you think could I hook in a quick and dirty print to show current progress?
2016-05-14 19:49:24	@J	I'm actually working on that
2016-05-14 19:49:29	@J	I had an idea I wanted to test
2016-05-14 19:49:41	@J	it looks nice, but I'm not sure it would work on Windows
2016-05-14 19:51:55	@J	I will test it, but a very simple version would be modifying fs.write at the bottom of import.py
2016-05-14 19:52:33	@J	pass to argument 'progress' a function taking 3 arguments - bytes done, bytes total, current filename
2016-05-14 19:54:45	@J	*it's actually _import.py
2016-05-14 19:54:59	Yoshi2	import_.py
2016-05-14 19:55:37	@J	close enough
2016-05-14 19:58:37	Yoshi2	yup, hooking into that works
2016-05-14 20:00:17	@J	weird, I installed Python 3.5 on my Windows VM and it installed into a user directory
2016-05-14 20:00:40	Yoshi2	python 3.5 is weird, it even has a different looking installer
2016-05-14 20:00:54	Yoshi2	but I think it is possible to make it install into the usual place
2016-05-14 20:01:39	@J	I can't see an option
2016-05-14 20:01:48	@J	I'll just tell it to add to PATH
2016-05-14 20:02:25	@J	okay, this actually works on Windows
2016-05-14 20:02:41	@J	and I do like how it looks
2016-05-14 20:04:49	@J	updated at the same URL again
2016-05-14 20:09:58	Yoshi2	J: what did you change? I'm using the updated files and it doesn't show any progress bar
2016-05-14 20:13:15	@J	 oh, right, forgot to say
2016-05-14 20:13:17	@J	it's optional
2016-05-14 20:13:24	@J	add --display-progress before the command argument
2016-05-14 20:14:50	Yoshi2	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-05-14 20:15:05	Yoshi2	very sexy progress display
2016-05-14 20:26:06	Yoshi2	J: being able to choose the exact directory to update does speed up the image rebuilding by quite a bit

2016-05-14 22:46:51	Marty2000	I'll add everything to Pikipedia, and I'll probably do the same for the Spanish version tomorrow
2016-05-14 23:01:27	@Espyo	how weird

2016-05-14 23:02:01	Marty2000	Yes, the names are different
2016-05-14 23:02:06	Marty2000	Same for Spanish, I think

2016-05-14 23:03:22	Marty2000	It might not be a very important thing

2016-05-14 23:04:23	@Espyo	words cannot express my disgust right now

2016-05-14 23:35:32	Marty2000	Welcome back
2016-05-14 23:41:45	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-14 23:41:48	@Espyo	took forever to restart...
2016-05-14 23:41:54	@Espyo	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxgV2mfIRj4
2016-05-14 23:43:17	Marty2000	Hmm... strange
2016-05-14 23:43:24	Marty2000	And bad glitch :/
2016-05-14 23:43:48	Marty2000	It can ruin speedruns
2016-05-14 23:51:54	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-14 23:52:01	@Espyo	wonder if it happens outside of Japan
2016-05-14 23:52:04	@Espyo	I have a feeling it doesn't
2016-05-14 23:52:38	Marty2000	Hmm... I might try later with my NPC! version, if you want
2016-05-14 23:52:43	Marty2000	(my European one)
2016-05-14 23:52:54	Marty2000	And I can also try with the Gamecube American version
2016-05-14 23:53:21	Marty2000	As for the NPC! american one, I can't land in any area: the game crashes
2016-05-14 23:53:36	Marty2000	But I'll try after I have finished writing the French names
2016-05-14 23:54:48	@Espyo	sure, should be easy to test
2016-05-14 23:55:02	@Espyo	you probably only need to test European NPC!P2
2016-05-14 23:55:14	@Espyo	if it didn't get fixed then, that means it didn't get fixed anywhere
2016-05-14 23:55:41	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-15 00:04:07	@Espyo	going now

2016-05-15 17:03:48	zoltcat	um, how has your day been?
2016-05-15 17:06:33	Marty2000	Good, thanks. Yours?
2016-05-15 17:07:00	zoltcat	good. I found the Forums, so I'm very happy 
2016-05-15 17:07:11	Marty2000	COol :)
2016-05-15 17:07:53	zoltcat	I've already posted some art work on it...
2016-05-15 17:10:09	Marty2000	Oh, they're funny! Can't wait to see Brittany!
2016-05-15 17:10:57	zoltcat	idk if I'll draw her... I've never been able to draw her well...
2016-05-15 17:12:42	Marty2000	It's okay, but still, the other ones are cool!
2016-05-15 17:13:16	zoltcat	thanks :)
2016-05-15 17:17:31	zoltcat	do you, by chance, know if it's okay to add the Brittany image to a reply on the thread or if I have to give her her own post?
2016-05-15 17:18:01	Marty2000	I think you can add her to a reply ;)
2016-05-15 17:19:03	zoltcat	okay. thanks!
2016-05-15 17:19:24	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-15 17:21:00	zoltcat	so how do you carry on a conversation? Because I have no social skills at all!
2016-05-15 17:22:44	Marty2000	Hmm... I don't know either to be honest. Sometimes we discuss about the Pikmin series, especially when we make new discoveries, or we also talk about everything, or we also do not talk at all.
2016-05-15 17:23:06	Marty2000	It really depends on the moment
2016-05-15 17:23:38	zoltcat	hmmm... well, I guess I have an idea as to why most people love Alph XD
2016-05-15 17:23:52	Marty2000	Ah?
2016-05-15 17:24:17	zoltcat	He looks like Olimar. It's nostalgia. 
2016-05-15 17:25:21	Marty2000	I se
2016-05-15 17:25:23	Marty2000	I see*
2016-05-15 17:25:43	UltraMario	we also talk about smash :^)
2016-05-15 17:26:04	zoltcat	I'm... not good at smash :')
2016-05-15 17:28:49	zoltcat	I'm still not sure how to play it...
2016-05-15 17:29:46	Marty2000	That's not a problem, I am not good at Smash either but I think it's really a fun game thanks to the many collectibles and characters
2016-05-15 17:30:20	zoltcat	it is a fun game. 
2016-05-15 17:30:41	zoltcat	a game with weird controls, but fun
2016-05-15 17:31:54	Marty2000	I see what you mean... It's true there are lots of controls to learn, but after a while, you usually get used to them
2016-05-15 17:32:59	zoltcat	I sadly can't. My brother always has my 3DS, because his broke. Something happened to the charge port. 
2016-05-15 17:33:13	Marty2000	Oh :/
2016-05-15 17:33:52	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-15 17:33:56	UltraMario	it's super fun
2016-05-15 17:34:03	UltraMario	although i disagree with controls
2016-05-15 17:34:04	UltraMario	well
2016-05-15 17:34:04	zoltcat	yah. It's a shame.
2016-05-15 17:34:08	UltraMario	unlss you were playing
2016-05-15 17:34:11	UltraMario	the 3ds version
2016-05-15 17:34:12	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-15 17:34:15	UltraMario	or with a wii remote
2016-05-15 17:34:32	UltraMario	never play smash with a wii remote btw
2016-05-15 17:34:34	UltraMario	it's terrible
2016-05-15 17:34:42	zoltcat	I played Brawl once, and died in eight seconds.

2016-05-15 17:35:20	UltraMario	i just use my gamecube controller mostly
2016-05-15 17:35:24	UltraMario	cuz im used to it
2016-05-15 17:35:24	zoltcat	and I was playing as a weaker character...
2016-05-15 17:36:07	zoltcat	I'll stick to Mario Cart...
2016-05-15 17:36:14	zoltcat	but I'm bad at even that
2016-05-15 17:36:23	UltraMario	git gud
2016-05-15 17:36:24	UltraMario	:^)
2016-05-15 17:36:50	zoltcat	I only have my little brother to compete against.  
2016-05-15 17:37:15	zoltcat	I only know I'm bad because I was racing a friend and lost. 
2016-05-15 17:38:01	zoltcat	like... so many races 
2016-05-15 17:38:48	zoltcat	so... what are you guys doing?

2016-05-15 21:26:54	Marty2000	I have just noticed it but the manual of Pikmin 3 that we can access via HOME has languages we cannot use in-game : Russion, Portuguese, and Dutch
2016-05-15 21:27:11	Marty2000	Which means I have official translations for said languages for the following things:
2016-05-15 21:27:29	Marty2000	Story, mission, Bingo Battle, dismiss, apps, leader, move, whistle, throw, dismiss, pluck, punch, charge, ultra-spicy spray, ultra-spicy nectar, dodge,
2016-05-15 21:27:54	Marty2000	pause menu, radar screen, lock-on, dodge whistle, sun meter, juice left, compass, go here, exploration notes, pikmin info app, fruit file app, camera,
2016-05-15 21:27:55	Marty2000	replay, collec treasure!, nuggets, battle enemies:, defeat bosses!, victory macaron, onion, map, Cupid's Grenade, Golden Grenade, lucky marble, rock storm,
2016-05-15 21:28:04	Marty2000	mine, shuffle, warp, wall, bomb rock
2016-05-15 21:28:21	Marty2000	I will write them somewhere...
2016-05-15 21:29:10	Marty2000	By the way: Russian*
2016-05-15 21:31:18	Yoshi2	russion
2016-05-15 21:31:45	Marty2000	:p
2016-05-15 21:32:36	Yoshi2	russian cannot be used ingame?
2016-05-15 21:33:04	Marty2000	No
2016-05-15 21:33:16	Marty2000	The manual can be set to Russian, though
2016-05-15 21:33:37	Yoshi2	that's interesting
2016-05-15 21:33:50	Yoshi2	maybe translating the manual is easier/cheaper than translating the game
2016-05-15 21:33:56	Marty2000	Only for Smash
2016-05-15 21:34:07	Marty2000	Same for Dutch and Portuguese
2016-05-15 21:34:20	Marty2000	Maybe...

2016-05-15 22:09:41	@PikFan	hope nothing bad happened while I was supposed to be here but wasn't
2016-05-15 22:10:20	@PikFan	Espyo, Marty2000: that Splatfest was SO close
2016-05-15 22:10:27	@PikFan	I couldn't believe it
2016-05-15 22:10:49	@PikFan	and also, I didn't expect Fancy (Black Tie?) to be more popular
2016-05-15 22:11:54	@PikFan	I still can't get my Splatfest power into 1700, though...
2016-05-15 22:12:06	Marty2000	Hi PikFan
2016-05-15 22:12:11	@PikFan	this Splatfest it was hovering at slightly above 1600
2016-05-15 22:12:12	--	Yoshi2 is now known as Yoshi2|offline
2016-05-15 22:12:26	Marty2000	I didn't see the results, and I didn't participate a lot this time, though
2016-05-15 22:12:28	@PikFan	last Splatfest though, I was at around 1570-ish
2016-05-15 22:12:34	Marty2000	But that one was hard, according to me
2016-05-15 22:12:54	@PikFan	it's only hard because your Splatfest power is so high...
2016-05-15 22:13:32	@PikFan	though, I have a friend who made it to 1800
2016-05-15 22:13:35	@PikFan	my jaw dropped
2016-05-15 22:13:56	@PikFan	and let's not even mention the people who get up to like 2500
2016-05-15 22:14:01	@PikFan	how do people even do that
2016-05-15 22:14:05	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-15 22:14:27	@PikFan	it's like... they haven't slept since the game launched, or something
2016-05-15 22:15:00	@PikFan	they're omnipotent and omniscient in Splatoon
2016-05-15 22:15:16	@PikFan	but anyway
2016-05-15 22:16:05	@PikFan	so, the results were: Black Tie was more popular, with 52%
2016-05-15 22:16:22	@PikFan	and Black Tie won more battles, with 51%
2016-05-15 22:16:30	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-15 22:16:55	@PikFan	the final score was 358-342
2016-05-15 22:17:02	@PikFan	really close Splatfest
2016-05-15 22:17:10	Marty2000	Wow
2016-05-15 22:17:12	Marty2000	Definitely
2016-05-15 22:17:31	Marty2000	Only a 16-point difference...
2016-05-15 22:17:56	@PikFan	I'm glad it wasn't like Japan's Love vs Money Splatfest
2016-05-15 22:17:59	Marty2000	First time it's that close
2016-05-15 22:18:08	@PikFan	that one was 353-347

2016-05-15 22:22:14	@PikFan	anyway, I decided to take statistics, to see if I really am bad at Splatfests

2016-05-15 22:23:33	Marty2000	I think I won 3 matches
2016-05-15 22:23:38	Marty2000	And lost the rest
2016-05-15 22:23:40	@PikFan	huh
2016-05-15 22:23:43	Marty2000	And got disconnected once
2016-05-15 22:23:51	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-15 22:23:52	@PikFan	yeah, I also got disconnected once
2016-05-15 22:24:07	@PikFan	but that was way after when all the servers went down
2016-05-15 22:24:36	Marty2000	Wasn't here when that thing happened
2016-05-15 22:24:41	@PikFan	same
2016-05-15 22:25:01	@PikFan	anyway, so out of those 5 battles I fought against my own team:
2016-05-15 22:25:05	@PikFan	I lost 4 times against my team, and won 1 time
2016-05-15 22:25:12	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-15 22:25:22	@PikFan	and the 1 time that I won was when I got the royalty title, heh

2016-05-15 22:28:11	@Espyo	any second now
2016-05-15 22:28:23	@PikFan	14:16.29	PikFan	so, the results were: Black Tie was more popular, with 52%
2016-05-15 22:28:26	Marty2000	So, you did see? 
2016-05-15 22:28:30	@PikFan	14:16.46	PikFan	and Black Tie won more battles, with 51%
2016-05-15 22:28:39	@PikFan	14:17.19	PikFan	the final score was 358-342
2016-05-15 22:28:41	Marty2000	I've added every Spanish and French names for both versions to Pikipedia
2016-05-15 22:28:44	Marty2000	And also...
2016-05-15 22:28:51	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cupid%27s_Grenade#Names_in_other_languages
2016-05-15 22:28:53	@Espyo	...wha?
2016-05-15 22:29:05	@Espyo	fancy party won votes?
2016-05-15 22:29:09	@Espyo	I'd figure the opposite
2016-05-15 22:29:10	@PikFan	I know
2016-05-15 22:29:17	@PikFan	I was weirded out too
2016-05-15 22:29:40	@Espyo	Marty2000: cool
2016-05-15 22:29:42	Marty2000	In the manual of Pikmin, you have official Russian, Dutch and Portuguese names
2016-05-15 22:29:45	Marty2000	Pikmin 3*
2016-05-15 22:29:52	@PikFan	neat
2016-05-15 22:29:56	Marty2000	So for example
2016-05-15 22:30:11	Marty2000	Cupid's Grenade:
2016-05-15 22:30:15	@Espyo	yeah, I gathered all Portuguese names I could already
2016-05-15 22:30:17	@Espyo	I...think
2016-05-15 22:31:10	Marty2000	Portuguese = Granada do Cupido | Dutch = cupido-kers | Russian = несколько гранат (neskol’ko granat)
2016-05-15 22:31:24	@PikFan	huh
2016-05-15 22:31:41	@Espyo	neat

2016-05-15 22:37:29	@PikFan	because I really am
2016-05-15 22:37:40	@Espyo	haha
2016-05-15 22:37:43	@Espyo	you never did
2016-05-15 22:37:51	Marty2000	Does any of you know the abbreviation for "Russian" please in that table, please? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cupid%27s_Grenade#Names_in_other_languages
2016-05-15 22:37:56	@Espyo	it's game-changing
2016-05-15 22:37:58	Marty2000	Motion controls
2016-05-15 22:37:58	@PikFan	with sticks, you can't just swing the camera around right behind you
2016-05-15 22:38:04	Marty2000	I really should try...
2016-05-15 22:38:08	@Espyo	Marty2000: absolutely no idea of Russian
2016-05-15 22:38:08	@PikFan	but with motion controls...
2016-05-15 22:38:12	Marty2000	But I can't manage to
2016-05-15 22:38:27	@Espyo	yeah, with motion controls, after you get used to it, it's beautiful

2016-05-15 22:46:33	@Espyo	I thought you were asking about abbreviations in the Russian language

2016-05-15 22:47:07	@Espyo	oh, looks like we don't support Russian
2016-05-15 22:47:08	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-15 22:47:17	@Espyo	you can add it anyway, and I'll add the support one day
2016-05-15 22:47:18	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-15 22:47:31	Marty2000	I'll put it as a note
2016-05-15 22:48:30	@Espyo	no, you can put it right away like a normal string
2016-05-15 22:48:37	@Espyo	and when I add the support, it'll work right away
2016-05-15 22:50:38	@PikFan	wow, great snipers
2016-05-15 22:50:49	@PikFan	my team had 3 snipers on it
2016-05-15 22:51:00	@PikFan	and we annihilated the other team
2016-05-15 22:51:24	@PikFan	...then again, I got 1500 points and 10 kills, so I probably was a big help
2016-05-15 22:51:58	Marty2000	I have done so and added this "In the manual of Pikmin 3, it it also possible to find the Russian name of the Cupid's Grenade: it is "несколько гранат" (neskol’ko granat)" just below, we can remove that sentence once you made the support
2016-05-15 22:52:04	Marty2000	I've chosen "|Rus"
2016-05-15 22:52:20	Marty2000	He he, good :)
2016-05-15 23:01:10	@Espyo	oh...
2016-05-15 23:01:19	@Espyo	Marty, be careful when transcribing the text, though
2016-05-15 23:01:23	@Espyo	you made a mistake on the Portuguese one
2016-05-15 23:01:28	Marty2000	Ah?
2016-05-15 23:01:32	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-05-15 23:02:06	@Espyo	ok, so you added the warning because there currently is no Russian name in the article
2016-05-15 23:02:08	@Espyo	but you don't need to
2016-05-15 23:02:17	@Espyo	I'll add the support in just a few days
2016-05-15 23:02:21	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-15 23:02:22	@Espyo	I don't think it deserves a warning
2016-05-15 23:02:34	Marty2000	I didn't add the warning for the Ultra-spicy spray article

2016-05-16 00:42:59	Marty2000	Bouzo is a priest, isn't it?
2016-05-16 00:43:12	@PikFan	no, that's nyuudou
2016-05-16 00:43:27	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-05-16 00:43:48	Nvortex	i trust you have been hacking to the gate pikfan ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2016-05-16 00:44:04	Nvortex	and by sensei you mean some japanese teacher?
2016-05-16 00:44:16	Nvortex	you could have asked about all of the possible puns of the name
2016-05-16 00:46:43	Marty2000	I have a Japanese friend, I should ask her about those things when she is less busy
2016-05-16 00:46:45	Marty2000	During Summer
2016-05-16 00:47:00	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-16 00:48:00	@PikFan	what is she writing?
2016-05-16 00:48:09	@PikFan	I can't tell if it's English or Japanese
2016-05-16 00:48:15	Marty2000	Japanese
2016-05-16 00:48:21	Marty2000	I have difficulties readin too
2016-05-16 00:48:42	Marty2000	Ok, I'll charge a Bubbler
2016-05-16 00:49:00	Marty2000	I'm fed up of that Splash-o-Matic throwing bombs all over the place guy
2016-05-16 00:50:50	@PikFan	lol
2016-05-16 00:50:55	@PikFan	I got only 5 points
2016-05-16 00:51:10	@PikFan	sorry, I have to quit playing
2016-05-16 00:51:28	Marty2000	I think I got strictly what I needed to have the Bubbler
2016-05-16 00:51:33	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-16 00:51:37	Marty2000	Hammerhad Bridge
2016-05-16 00:51:39	Marty2000	Finally
2016-05-16 00:51:43	@PikFan	oh wow
2016-05-16 00:54:46	Marty2000	We didn't meet
2016-05-16 00:55:04	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-16 00:55:09	Marty2000	You were not even here
2016-05-16 00:55:12	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-16 00:55:36	@PikFan	yeah, my mom wanted me to leave :<
2016-05-16 00:55:42	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-16 00:56:53	Marty2000	I received a friend request from one of the people we met
2016-05-16 00:57:01	Marty2000	It's your friend
2016-05-16 00:57:04	Marty2000	Tatsu
2016-05-16 00:57:08	@PikFan	ah, I see
2016-05-16 00:57:08	@PikFan	nice
2016-05-16 00:57:22	Marty2000	Yep!
2016-05-16 00:57:41	@PikFan	how long will it take to upload the videos? I can't wait to watch them
2016-05-16 00:59:24	Marty2000	Hmm... I can't tell, it really depends, but the main video (that one match when I said I'd record) will probably take 30 minutes
2016-05-16 00:59:36	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-16 00:59:54	Marty2000	I also have some others parts, so I'll upload them too
2016-05-16 01:00:04	@PikFan	right
2016-05-16 01:01:25	Marty2000	But as I said, it takes some time, because my videos are heavy (300 Mb for 3 minutes) but they will be here soon ;)
2016-05-16 01:01:43	@PikFan	yay
2016-05-16 01:03:01	Marty2000	This is your channel, right? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCPkRSLSIDQnK5zXmAG86zg
2016-05-16 01:03:27	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-16 01:03:35	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-16 01:03:36	@PikFan	why?
2016-05-16 01:03:46	Marty2000	Oh, just wanted to know
2016-05-16 01:03:51	Marty2000	I wasn't sure
2016-05-16 01:04:02	@PikFan	lol okay
2016-05-16 01:05:58	@PikFan	how did you find me?
2016-05-16 01:06:36	Marty2000	You left a comment on one of video, once
2016-05-16 01:06:42	Marty2000	I'm trying to find it
2016-05-16 01:06:47	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-16 01:07:06	Nvortex	you just got 1 more sub
2016-05-16 01:07:15	Marty2000	It's a funny coincidence because we didn't know each other at that time
2016-05-16 01:07:51	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/snR1T6LUNXQ This one video
2016-05-16 01:08:10	@PikFan	oh yeah yeah yeah, that
2016-05-16 01:08:52	Nvortex	wtf
2016-05-16 01:09:00	Nvortex	there's no way you didn't know at that time
2016-05-16 01:09:17	@PikFan	Nvortex: thanks for the sub
2016-05-16 01:09:20	Marty2000	Hmm... one or two months ago, I didn't know PikFan
2016-05-16 01:09:24	@PikFan	even though I don't have any videos :P
2016-05-16 01:09:25	Marty2000	I'm sure
2016-05-16 01:09:41	@PikFan	oh and I subbed to your channel Marty
2016-05-16 01:09:47	Marty2000	I saw, thanks
2016-05-16 01:09:49	Marty2000	I did so too
2016-05-16 01:11:43	@PikFan	ugh, how do I look at my subscribers
2016-05-16 01:11:54	@PikFan	wait, never mind
2016-05-16 01:11:57	Nvortex	you only have 2
2016-05-16 01:12:08	Nvortex	its in your channel
2016-05-16 01:12:21	@PikFan	yeah, I found it
2016-05-16 01:12:28	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/subscribers
2016-05-16 01:12:35	@PikFan	I know
2016-05-16 01:12:49	Marty2000	2016-04-25 21:14:33	Marty2000	Hi!  The first time I said "Hi" to PikFan
2016-05-16 01:14:34	@PikFan	ahh...
2016-05-16 01:14:45	@PikFan	if only I had my own computer and recording equipment...
2016-05-16 01:14:53	@PikFan	as well as a bunch of other fun software
2016-05-16 01:16:49	Marty2000	I have got my own recorder at Christmas: it's an AVerMedia Live Gamer Portable: got it for 129 euros (must be roughly the same in dollars). It's simple but enough to record stuff (I don't use anything else) 
2016-05-16 01:17:22	@PikFan	that's $145.95
2016-05-16 01:17:29	@PikFan	so a little bit more
2016-05-16 01:17:50	@PikFan	that seems like a reasonable price
2016-05-16 01:17:52	@PikFan	brb
2016-05-16 01:17:53	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-16 01:21:29	@PikFan	back
2016-05-16 01:22:00	Marty2000	Welcome back
2016-05-16 01:22:10	@PikFan	thanks
2016-05-16 01:28:51	@PikFan	hopefully I can get some recording equipment before the new Zelda comes out
2016-05-16 01:29:00	@PikFan	I'd love to record myself playing it
2016-05-16 01:36:41	@PikFan	alright, gotta go now

2016-05-16 11:51:38	Yoshi2	hey marty
2016-05-16 11:57:07	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-16 12:00:06	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxgV2mfIRj4 Gonna verify HSS0136's glitch but I bet it'll work
2016-05-16 12:00:14	Marty2000	(on Wii)
2016-05-16 12:01:29	@Espyo	good luck
2016-05-16 12:01:48	Marty2000	I just have to restart a save because I'm on Day 3 on one of them... Pellet Posies disappear after entering a cave on that day
2016-05-16 12:01:53	Marty2000	(Valley of Repose)
2016-05-16 12:01:54	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-16 12:10:44	Marty2000	Day 1 finished. I'll copy the save to another slot and try the glitch then
2016-05-16 12:21:07	Marty2000	Ok, I have 10 Purple Pikmin, and I'm returning to the surface
2016-05-16 12:22:20	Marty2000	I have to re-enter the cave without some Purples, as I can see.
2016-05-16 12:22:34	Marty2000	Otherwise the cutscene does not trigger
2016-05-16 12:25:00	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-16 12:25:15	Marty2000	I managed to reproduce on my first try
2016-05-16 12:25:20	@Espyo	neat
2016-05-16 12:25:22	Marty2000	So it's the same as the Gamecube version
2016-05-16 12:25:31	Marty2000	No Pikmin seeds are ejected
2016-05-16 12:26:44	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-16 12:26:49	@Espyo	what cutscene is that, anyway?
2016-05-16 12:27:05	Marty2000	The same as HSS
2016-05-16 12:27:18	Marty2000	I followed his video while playing
2016-05-16 12:27:31	Marty2000	I've recorded, I think
2016-05-16 12:27:32	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-16 12:29:57	Marty2000	So I retrieved two pellets, the first one is absorbed but no seeds are produced, and the second one is sucked up by the Onion only after the cutscene has finished
2016-05-16 12:31:11	Marty2000	I'll retry the glitch, I feel something wrong...
2016-05-16 12:33:58	Marty2000	Ok, I have a complete video this time, you will understand better
2016-05-16 12:34:16	Marty2000	Even if the seeds are not ejected... they're kept in the game's memory
2016-05-16 12:34:27	Marty2000	And ejected when a new pellet is retrieved
2016-05-16 12:37:26	Marty2000	It's being uploaded, here soon. Cool glitch, anyway!
2016-05-16 12:38:02	@Espyo	yeah, but
2016-05-16 12:38:06	@Espyo	his video is in Japanese
2016-05-16 12:38:15	@Espyo	so I can't really see what cutscene it is :|
2016-05-16 12:38:36	Marty2000	The cutscene that explains commands on Day 3
2016-05-16 12:38:55	Marty2000	"Louie, has Olimar told you how to manage Pikmin?" or something like that
2016-05-16 12:39:37	Marty2000	You can have it on day 2 following certain steps
2016-05-16 12:48:33	Yoshi2	I'm looking into the format for strings in battalion wars and I have absolutely no idea how it works
2016-05-16 12:55:40	Yoshi2	the game somehow assigns IDs to each message, but I'm not sure how it is done
2016-05-16 12:57:35	Marty2000	Espyo: https://youtu.be/1dwQoTBwx9Q   Yoshi2: what format is it?
2016-05-16 12:59:41	Yoshi2	Marty2000: here's what the first around 0x1D0 bytes can look: https://imgur.com/XDdV1Zp
2016-05-16 13:00:20	Marty2000	I see... I don't think I can help you, sorry
2016-05-16 13:01:04	Yoshi2	that's some sort of metadata that goes on for several hundreds of bytes, and only much later does the actual text start: https://imgur.com/eWIY570
2016-05-16 13:01:58	Marty2000	That's strange...
2016-05-16 13:18:28	Yoshi2	I have a lead, I think I have a lead
2016-05-16 13:19:19	Yoshi2	first 4 bytes are a magic number identifying the file, second 4 bytes are number of message slots in the file
2016-05-16 13:20:02	Marty2000	Good
2016-05-16 13:21:59	@Espyo	cool, Marty2000 
2016-05-16 13:22:01	Yoshi2	well, probably
2016-05-16 13:23:27	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/vw2X7L3tiMo Another strange glitch in which a rock doesn't break when encountering a wall
2016-05-16 13:24:49	@Espyo	hm, neat
2016-05-16 13:25:22	@Espyo	makes sense
2016-05-16 13:25:41	Marty2000	I'm still trying to reproduce the glitch that makes a walking Armored Cannon Larva buried, I just can't, that's tiresome
2016-05-16 13:25:47	Marty2000	Yes, since the rock is sliding
2016-05-16 13:33:04	@Espyo	yeah...

2016-05-16 15:07:30	UltraMario	iinteresting
2016-05-16 15:09:50	Marty2000	Yep, I preferred the text of the demo to be honest. Sadly, I cannot get it with codes because the latter do not affect the Ship's dialogs, only the pieces of text you can find in some menus...
2016-05-16 15:10:34	Marty2000	I got another glitch with an Armored Cannon Larva at the second, but I wasn't recording (of course). It got stunned for... let's say, 0.5 second
2016-05-16 15:11:26	Marty2000	Normally, when it is stuned, the duration is 5 seconds
2016-05-16 15:11:54	UltraMario	well it's not in the final game i dont think
2016-05-16 15:11:56	UltraMario	only in the demo
2016-05-16 15:12:04	UltraMario	but yeah i like the demo's better too
2016-05-16 15:12:22	Marty2000	Yeah, but some time ago, I posted a code which allow you to have some of the demo texts, in the JPN version
2016-05-16 15:12:26	Marty2000	You were even here ;)
2016-05-16 15:14:32	Marty2000	Espyo!!
2016-05-16 15:14:36	Marty2000	I managed to get the glitch!
2016-05-16 15:16:54	Marty2000	You can even stun that buried glitchy version
2016-05-16 15:17:02	Marty2000	And this time, I was recording
2016-05-16 15:17:09	Marty2000	I think I've understood how the glitch works
2016-05-16 15:18:54	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-16 15:19:34	Marty2000	Somehow
2016-05-16 15:19:49	Marty2000	The walking version must be at the limit of its territory radius
2016-05-16 15:19:55	Marty2000	So trying to get back to that territory
2016-05-16 15:20:17	Marty2000	(use all you can do to make it walk out of that territory)
2016-05-16 15:20:31	Marty2000	And if you stun it while it is trying to get back to its territory
2016-05-16 15:20:34	Marty2000	The glitch occurs
2016-05-16 15:21:01	Marty2000	Ah... great, I was trying to perform the glitch for weeks...
2016-05-16 15:24:34	Marty2000	If you want an example.... it is similar to when a Breadbug buries itself in P1
2016-05-16 15:25:12	Marty2000	When that Breadbug is in a place it isn't supposed to be, it buries itself and re-appear elsewhere
2016-05-16 15:25:27	Marty2000	I suspect it's the same kind of thing for the A.C.L

2016-05-16 15:51:24	Yoshi2	ok, gamepedia has added advertisements on the right which push all content to the left
2016-05-16 15:52:07	Yoshi2	and I feel like gamepedia became slower loading, too
2016-05-16 15:52:58	Yoshi2	rip looking up stuff on the terraria wiki
2016-05-16 15:54:13	Marty2000	:/

2016-05-16 16:30:11	@PikFan	hi
2016-05-16 16:30:19	Marty2000	Hey PikFan
2016-05-16 16:30:31	@PikFan	so I watched the videos you posted last night
2016-05-16 16:30:48	@PikFan	...it's so weird seeing "Booyah!/C'mon!" replaced with "Nice!/To me!"
2016-05-16 16:30:49	Marty2000	I have to post some more
2016-05-16 16:30:54	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-16 16:31:03	Marty2000	Yes, regional differences
2016-05-16 16:31:08	@PikFan	but why
2016-05-16 16:31:16	Marty2000	It's like Pikmin
2016-05-16 16:31:17	@PikFan	it's so tiny
2016-05-16 16:31:20	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-05-16 16:31:30	Marty2000	I don't know either...
2016-05-16 16:31:34	@PikFan	it's such a tiny thing, I don't see why they need to change it
2016-05-16 16:31:41	Marty2000	Maybe it sounds "better" for us??
2016-05-16 16:31:47	@PikFan	maybe
2016-05-16 16:32:01	Marty2000	Well, I don't see any difference
2016-05-16 16:32:14	@PikFan	I was going to say, maybe it has to do with Britain, because they seem more..."formal" than the US
2016-05-16 16:32:28	@PikFan	of course, maybe I'm just stereotyping
2016-05-16 16:32:38	 *	@PikFan shrugs
2016-05-16 16:32:42	Marty2000	I couldn't answer you, to be honest
2016-05-16 16:32:48	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-05-16 16:32:51	@PikFan	it's fine
2016-05-16 16:36:53	@PikFan	how did you do this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdHljZUbB2E
2016-05-16 16:37:11	Marty2000	Let's test. Which one sounds best to you: "highly nutritional food source that has been scientifically proven" or "highly nutritious food source which has been scientifically proven to encourage" (it's nearly the same, honestly...)? 
2016-05-16 16:37:20	Marty2000	"Perplexing, isn't it?" or "Curious, isn't it?"
2016-05-16 16:37:21	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-16 16:37:28	Marty2000	It's a very complicated glitch
2016-05-16 16:37:30	Marty2000	But basically
2016-05-16 16:37:44	Marty2000	You need to find a way to push the enemy out of its territory
2016-05-16 16:37:51	Marty2000	And when it tries to get back
2016-05-16 16:38:03	Marty2000	Try to stun it with a Purple Pikmin
2016-05-16 16:38:15	Marty2000	(here, the wall helped me prevent him from getting back to the center)
2016-05-16 16:38:21	@PikFan	that does sound complicated
2016-05-16 16:40:01	Marty2000	And normally, it freezes for a second, and then it gets buried
2016-05-16 16:40:09	Marty2000	But as you can see, it's a glitchy buried version
2016-05-16 16:40:20	Marty2000	You can stun it, unlike the real buried cannon larva
2016-05-16 16:40:34	@PikFan	so, you turned a walking cannon larva into a buried one?
2016-05-16 16:40:39	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-16 16:40:39	@PikFan	fascinating
2016-05-16 16:40:53	Marty2000	Normally, they are different enemies
2016-05-16 16:40:57	@PikFan	there must be some property that determines its walking/buried
2016-05-16 16:41:04	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-16 16:41:15	Marty2000	But, in the game's memory, they have different internal names
2016-05-16 16:41:18	Marty2000	Wait, let me see..
2016-05-16 16:41:43	Marty2000	Walking = kabuto
2016-05-16 16:41:53	Marty2000	Buried = fkabuto
2016-05-16 16:42:06	Marty2000	Walking = 850 HP
2016-05-16 16:42:16	Marty2000	Buried = 2000 HP
2016-05-16 16:42:20	Marty2000	So, they're different 
2016-05-16 16:42:27	Marty2000	(theoretically)
2016-05-16 16:42:34	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm............
2016-05-16 16:42:37	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Armored_Cannon_Larva#Technical_information
2016-05-16 16:42:41	@PikFan	have you told Espyo about it?
2016-05-16 16:43:22	Marty2000	I have posted my video 30 minutes ago, but I think he isn't here at the moment.
2016-05-16 16:43:33	@PikFan	...I see
2016-05-16 16:43:36	@PikFan	Espyo, wake up
2016-05-16 16:43:42	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-16 16:44:15	UltraMario	wake Espyo up
2016-05-16 16:44:22	UltraMario	WAKE HIM INSIDE
2016-05-16 16:44:22	Marty2000	The mystery is that you can stun the glitchy buried version, but not the normal one...
2016-05-16 16:44:46	Marty2000	Which means it may be intended for the walking enemy to bury given some circumstances
2016-05-16 16:44:54	Marty2000	bury itself*
2016-05-16 16:45:33	Marty2000	And now... it makes me want to try with that enemy: http://www.pikminwiki.com/Decorated_Cannon_Beetle
2016-05-16 16:45:36	Marty2000	It may work
2016-05-16 16:46:04	Marty2000	That enemy doesn't have any buried counterpart in-game
2016-05-16 16:46:19	Marty2000	But using my glitch, maybe we can force it to get buried...
2016-05-16 16:46:55	@PikFan	hmmmmmmm
2016-05-16 16:46:57	@PikFan	go for it
2016-05-16 16:47:08	Marty2000	It's really complicated though
2016-05-16 16:47:28	Marty2000	I have been trying to reproduce the glitch for weeks for the green larva
2016-05-16 16:47:35	Marty2000	And only today, it worked
2016-05-16 16:48:22	Yoshi2	aaaaaaaaalright, I got this string format figured out, woooooooohoooooooo
2016-05-16 16:48:31	@PikFan	ohi Yoshi2
2016-05-16 16:48:31	Marty2000	Congrats!
2016-05-16 16:48:40	Yoshi2	o/ PikFan 
2016-05-16 16:48:48	@PikFan	\o/
2016-05-16 16:49:16	Yoshi2	all the meta data at the start of the string files contains pointers to strings later in the file
2016-05-16 16:50:01	Yoshi2	adding new strings means rebuilding the entire file because pointers stop being valid if you put data inbetween 
2016-05-16 16:50:53	UltraMario	 /o\
2016-05-16 16:51:14	@PikFan	gj breaking your arms UltraMario
2016-05-16 16:51:27	@PikFan	Yoshi2: what strings?
2016-05-16 16:51:44	Yoshi2	message data in battalion wars
2016-05-16 16:51:59	@PikFan	Battalion Wars...
2016-05-16 16:52:04	UltraMario	yes
2016-05-16 16:52:06	@PikFan	I don't recall
2016-05-16 16:52:14	UltraMario	it's like advance wars
2016-05-16 16:52:15	UltraMario	sorta
2016-05-16 16:52:18	UltraMario	iirc
2016-05-16 16:52:42	Yoshi2	not really
2016-05-16 16:52:47	UltraMario	b-but
2016-05-16 16:52:50	UltraMario	it's a spinoff
2016-05-16 16:52:52	UltraMario	right?
2016-05-16 16:52:52	UltraMario	;w;
2016-05-16 16:52:53	Yoshi2	it does have the cartoonish military thing going on
2016-05-16 16:53:00	Yoshi2	but gameplay is pretty different
2016-05-16 16:53:42	Yoshi2	it kinda follows the spirit of advance wars though, and in Japan it is directly tied to famicom wars 
2016-05-16 16:53:53	Yoshi2	so yeah, you can call it a spinoff
2016-05-16 16:54:38	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-16 17:02:00	@PikFan	I can't stand people like this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNkP_rRexlE
2016-05-16 17:02:02	@PikFan	how
2016-05-16 17:02:04	@PikFan	just...how
2016-05-16 17:02:21	@PikFan	it's people like him that prevent me from getting to S+
2016-05-16 17:02:31	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-16 17:02:44	Marty2000	People that kill and such just for videos and recognization?
2016-05-16 17:02:47	Marty2000	Yeah...
2016-05-16 17:02:58	@PikFan	not just that
2016-05-16 17:03:02	@PikFan	but the sheer /skill/
2016-05-16 17:03:16	@PikFan	how is he able to aim so good
2016-05-16 17:03:23	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-16 17:03:28	Marty2000	I guess he practises a lot
2016-05-16 17:03:52	@PikFan	>August 22 2015
2016-05-16 17:03:53	@PikFan	._.
2016-05-16 17:04:09	@PikFan	that's not even 3 months after Splatoon came out
2016-05-16 17:04:10	@PikFan	wtf
2016-05-16 17:04:14	Marty2000	There were already good players at that time
2016-05-16 17:04:23	@PikFan	yeah...
2016-05-16 17:04:42	@PikFan	welpo

2016-05-16 17:11:58	Yoshi2	maybe he had some experience with other games
2016-05-16 17:12:44	Marty2000	Possible
2016-05-16 17:14:19	@PikFan	I guess so

2016-05-16 17:22:50	Marty2000	Tht's impressive
2016-05-16 17:23:10	@PikFan	is the .52 Gal still that powerful
2016-05-16 17:23:26	Marty2000	I think it is
2016-05-16 17:23:30	Marty2000	Slightly nerfed
2016-05-16 17:23:40	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-16 17:23:47	@PikFan	I ought to try it out sometime
2016-05-16 17:31:14	Marty2000	Want to play Splatoon later, PikFan?
2016-05-16 17:31:23	@PikFan	sure
2016-05-16 17:31:39	Marty2000	I just have to eat right now, I'll be back soon
2016-05-16 17:31:41	@PikFan	when I get home in about 7 hours :P
2016-05-16 17:31:45	@PikFan	oh

2016-05-16 17:31:55	@PikFan	I actually have to leave in 10 minutes to get to class
2016-05-16 17:32:02	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-16 17:32:04	@PikFan	I don't have class right now
2016-05-16 17:32:16	Marty2000	I dunno if I'll be connected when you get back, though
2016-05-16 17:32:17	@PikFan	so by the time you get back I might be gone
2016-05-16 17:32:37	@PikFan	though, I might be on again by lunch
2016-05-16 17:32:43	@PikFan	which will be in 3 hours

2016-05-16 17:55:38	Marty2000	Welcome back
2016-05-16 17:56:10	Marty2000	So... I did manage to get the walking-buried Armored Cannon Larva glitch
2016-05-16 17:56:39	Marty2000	I think I'll add it to Pikipedia, because the way it works is interesting
2016-05-16 17:56:55	Marty2000	And you can stun that glitchy buried larva
2016-05-16 17:58:57	@Espyo	cool!
2016-05-16 18:00:49	Marty2000	I'll put "unknown circumstances" for the moment, even if I might have an explanation... I need more information anyway
2016-05-16 18:03:11	@Espyo	mhm
2016-05-16 18:04:59	Yoshi2	I almost got message dumping working perfectly, but something about the encoding seems off
2016-05-16 18:06:11	Yoshi2	more specifically, apostrophes
2016-05-16 18:08:02	@Espyo	do they look like floating commas or what?
2016-05-16 18:10:35	Yoshi2	oh this is hilarious
2016-05-16 18:11:22	Yoshi2	it's not a problem for all apostrophes, but for some they use not ' but one of `´
2016-05-16 18:11:56	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-16 18:12:07	@Espyo	seems like that's just the writer's fault
2016-05-16 18:12:34	Yoshi2	0x92
2016-05-16 18:12:47	Yoshi2	which isn't even part of the ascii standard and I think it isn't unicode either
2016-05-16 18:13:35	Yoshi2	but the strings are utf-16, as far as I can tell
2016-05-16 18:14:01	Yoshi2	well, I solved it like this: content = content.replace("\x92", "'")
2016-05-16 18:15:57	@Espyo	yyyyyep
2016-05-16 18:24:03	Yoshi2	sweet string dump: https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/435ab82b07a0fc487c96cbbc307438d5
2016-05-16 18:24:35	@Espyo	nice
2016-05-16 18:25:38	Yoshi2	that also solves the issue of not knowing when which message is triggered
2016-05-16 18:26:02	Yoshi2	the ID in that dump corresponds to IDs used in the lua scripts
2016-05-16 18:29:26	Yoshi2	so now it's easier to tell which messages are used or not
2016-05-16 18:32:29	@Espyo	the best part
2016-05-16 18:33:35	Yoshi2	that's not the best part
2016-05-16 18:33:41	Yoshi2	the best part will be adding new messages
2016-05-16 18:33:53	Yoshi2	because I think I figured out how that could be done
2016-05-16 18:35:02	Marty2000	Great work!
2016-05-16 18:35:34	Yoshi2	I haven't done it yet, I only have an idea of how it could be done
2016-05-16 18:35:51	Marty2000	Yeah, but that's already a big thing, according to me
2016-05-16 18:36:21	Yoshi2	it is quite a decent thing, indeed
2016-05-16 18:37:24	@Espyo	ah, sweet
2016-05-16 18:38:45	Yoshi2	but first will be voice acting mods
2016-05-16 18:43:08	@Espyo	with voices recorded by you?
2016-05-16 18:44:24	Yoshi2	what are the alternatives? :P
2016-05-16 18:45:06	<--	UltraMario (Mibbit@204.10.gn.otj) has quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)

2016-05-16 18:48:18	Marty2000	I agree
2016-05-16 18:48:41	Yoshi2	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2016-05-16 18:49:00	Yoshi2	that would be an idea
2016-05-16 18:49:58	Yoshi2	I'll have to look into how viable that would be
2016-05-16 18:52:32	Marty2000	Having your name in the credits, for example ;)
2016-05-16 18:53:29	Yoshi2	actually, it would be very hilarious if I redid all sounds in my voice
2016-05-16 18:53:34	Yoshi2	pew pew pewpewpew
2016-05-16 18:53:40	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-16 18:53:46	Yoshi2	but too much effort
2016-05-16 19:21:21	Yoshi2	I'll try to get myself into the right mood with this music  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrydNhvGy0w

2016-05-16 19:57:43	Marty2000	Hmm... I'm not entirely sure.... but it looks like you can't have 100 buried Pikmin at once (at least in Pikmin 2)...
2016-05-16 20:01:13	@Espyo	nope, pretty sure you can't
2016-05-16 20:01:18	@Espyo	wait
2016-05-16 20:01:20	@Espyo	I'm thinking wrong
2016-05-16 20:01:26	@Espyo	uhm... you might actually be able to
2016-05-16 20:01:27	@Espyo	but how?
2016-05-16 20:01:36	@Espyo	you can with Snitchbugs or Mamutas
2016-05-16 20:01:40	Marty2000	You can't using Mamutas or Snitchbugs

2016-05-16 20:03:29	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-05-16 20:03:41	@Espyo	does that Mamuta video have 99 buried Pikmin?
2016-05-16 20:03:46	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-16 20:04:07	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-16 20:08:15	Marty2000	Ok, I have killed every enemy of the Awakening Woods, I'll retrieve them all to see if I can have 100 seeds
2016-05-16 20:11:22	Marty2000	Seems you can
2016-05-16 20:11:47	Marty2000	That was hard to get 100 seeds ejected, by the way
2016-05-16 20:13:57	Yoshi2	I'm glad I have context, otherwise hearing about seeds being ejected would be pretty weird
2016-05-16 20:15:53	UltraMario	;)
2016-05-16 20:19:36	@Espyo	how did you get 100 seeds?
2016-05-16 20:19:42	@Espyo	what about the carrier Pikmin?
2016-05-16 20:21:27	Marty2000	I could return the Pikmin into their Onion
2016-05-16 20:22:28	@Espyo	in time?
2016-05-16 20:22:30	@Espyo	hmm, cool
2016-05-16 20:22:34	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-16 20:23:54	Marty2000	That wasn't easy, though... I failed several times, but fortunately I had corpses left in those cases.
2016-05-16 20:27:43	@Espyo	hm, nice
2016-05-16 20:39:00	Marty2000	I have the feeling that by using the same glitch as for the walking Armored Cannon Larva, you could have a buried Decorated one... I need it to be next to a slide, though.. like in the Valley of Repose
2016-05-16 20:39:11	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/20/1463427434-decorated.png
2016-05-16 20:41:13	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-16 20:41:27	Marty2000	Normally, they're not buried...
2016-05-16 20:41:31	Marty2000	But I wanna try
2016-05-16 20:41:37	Marty2000	Who knows, it might work...
2016-05-16 21:11:11	Marty2000	He he, NOW I can try to get a buried version, it can't get back to its "territory"

2016-05-17 15:05:34	Yoshi2	the most fun part of UK and Germany is that they are automatically in the final due to being part of the big 5 who fund the ESC
2016-05-17 15:07:14	@Espyo	heh

2016-05-17 15:24:48	Yoshi2	hey marty
2016-05-17 15:35:18	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-17 15:39:04	Yoshi2	I figured that having only my voice do the music remix would be a bit too awkward, so I mixed it into the music I was remixing
2016-05-17 15:40:44	@Espyo	hah, nice
2016-05-17 15:40:58	@Espyo	regardless, science requires sacrifices
2016-05-17 15:41:02	@Espyo	so next time, you HAVE to

2016-05-17 16:01:19	@Espyo	oh, hi Scruffy
2016-05-17 16:01:25	Scruffy	Hello!
2016-05-17 16:01:44	Scruffy	I'm in Jeju Island off the coast of Korea right now
2016-05-17 16:01:56	Scruffy	It's like the Hawaii of South Korea
2016-05-17 16:02:06	@Espyo	ooh
2016-05-17 16:02:13	@Espyo	is it as good as Hawaii though?
2016-05-17 16:02:17	Yoshi2	that's pretty cool
2016-05-17 16:02:36	Scruffy	I've never been to Hawaii, but I assume this is at least as impressive
2016-05-17 16:02:51	Scruffy	I hiked up Mount Hallasan today, the tallest mountain in the country
2016-05-17 16:02:59	Scruffy	And it was very breathtaking
2016-05-17 16:03:36	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-17 16:03:38	@Espyo	that's incredible!
2016-05-17 16:03:52	Scruffy	Thank

2016-05-17 16:04:35	Scruffy	I wanted to come on IRC today because of two Pikmin-related things that occurred to me in the past week
2016-05-17 16:04:55	@Espyo	oh?
2016-05-17 16:04:57	Scruffy	First, I have the plot to the Night Mode Pikmin 2 mod
2016-05-17 16:05:06	@Espyo	great
2016-05-17 16:05:07	@Espyo	let's hear it
2016-05-17 16:05:12	@Espyo	unless you want to keep it a secret till release
2016-05-17 16:05:19	Scruffy	No, I can reveal it
2016-05-17 16:06:09	Scruffy	Olimar fakes a crash landing on PNF-404 because he wants to escape the drudgery of tight-fisted Hocotate Freight
2016-05-17 16:06:21	-->	Gamefreak75 (NewYokuba@ram-60-96-440-89.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-17 16:06:58	@Espyo	hm... sounds good
2016-05-17 16:07:09	Scruffy	But little did he know the planet isn't uninhabited; it's policed by dangerous beasts who indict him for destruction of property
2016-05-17 16:07:24	Scruffy	He escapes with the bottle cap, for which he's also indicted with theft
2016-05-17 16:07:48	Scruffy	He returns to Hocotate, where the ship analyzes the bottle cap and finds Olimar's bounty to be 100 pokos
2016-05-17 16:08:24	Scruffy	So you must return to the Pikmin planet and steal more objects to raise Olimar's bounty to 10,000 pokos, to recover the same debt
2016-05-17 16:08:30	Scruffy	That's why it's at night
2016-05-17 16:08:43	Scruffy	And why enemies are more active
2016-05-17 16:09:12	Scruffy	I can't really reprogram the goal of the game, so I just modified the story into a parody of itself
2016-05-17 16:10:05	Marty2000	Sounds cool
2016-05-17 16:10:54	Scruffy	Also Louie's name is only mentioned once in the game. Otherwise no one can ever recall it, or just refer to him by something else
2016-05-17 16:12:41	Scruffy	Anyway, on a more serious note, the second thing
2016-05-17 16:13:15	@Espyo	hah
2016-05-17 16:13:43	Scruffy	The natural scenery of South Korea has inspired me in Blender
2016-05-17 16:14:11	Scruffy	I've been experimenting with creating natural environments, and I got the idea to create a Pikmin short movie
2016-05-17 16:14:29	Scruffy	Like, a full-length short movie, not a 30-second things
2016-05-17 16:14:31	Scruffy	thing*
2016-05-17 16:14:59	Scruffy	I have the plot all settled, and even though I keep trying to tell myself my computer can't handle it, it's too much fun to work on
2016-05-17 16:15:25	Scruffy	I have an updated movie-grade Pikmin model already and I'm working on set design
2016-05-17 16:15:31	@Espyo	well, if you make several small 5-second clips, one clip per scene or camera angle...
2016-05-17 16:15:33	Marty2000	Oh, great idea
2016-05-17 16:15:34	@Espyo	it SHOULD be able to not die
2016-05-17 16:15:48	@Espyo	might make the camera a bit jumpy, but hey, at least it works
2016-05-17 16:15:54	@Espyo	are you sure you're up for it, though?
2016-05-17 16:15:56	@Espyo	it's one hell of a project
2016-05-17 16:16:01	Scruffy	True
2016-05-17 16:16:20	Scruffy	I know
2016-05-17 16:16:21	Scruffy	I say these things like they're a breeze
2016-05-17 16:16:32	Scruffy	This is going to take a while
2016-05-17 16:16:45	Scruffy	But I've already made good first steps
2016-05-17 16:16:56	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-17 16:17:05	Scruffy	The premise is a Purple Pikmin that wants to be more like White Pikmin, faster and more nimble
2016-05-17 16:17:23	@Espyo	well, I DID also had the crazy idea of programming an entire game engine that is powerful enough to support anything
2016-05-17 16:17:23	Scruffy	I don't know if I should reveal more
2016-05-17 16:17:27	@Espyo	and yet, here I am...
2016-05-17 16:17:32	Scruffy	hehe
2016-05-17 16:17:38	@Espyo	so it can be possible if you actually put effort into it
2016-05-17 16:17:45	@Espyo	but real life keeps getting in the way...
2016-05-17 16:17:52	Scruffy	Right
2016-05-17 16:17:54	@Espyo	I think you revealed enough
2016-05-17 16:18:01	Scruffy	I'm going to have a lot of time this summer though
2016-05-17 16:18:02	@Espyo	good to keep the imagination running, but not too much detail
2016-05-17 16:18:07	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-17 16:18:13	@Espyo	didn't you have another big project you wanted to work on this summer?
2016-05-17 16:18:21	@Espyo	also Pikmin related, I think
2016-05-17 16:18:25	Yoshi2	I am singlehandedly progressing the modding scene for a game that has maybe a handful of people who are still interested in the game ヽ(°▽ °)ノ 
2016-05-17 16:18:28	Scruffy	Anyway, I have my main character all modeled to look like a Purple Pikmin from the official Pikmin short movies
2016-05-17 16:18:59	@Espyo	Yoshi2: what is Pikmin
2016-05-17 16:19:08	@Espyo	seriously, have you seen how many people are interested in Pikmin shenanigans?
2016-05-17 16:19:13	Scruffy	Movable eyes with resizable pupils, hair that falls like cloth in real-time, and a streamlined way to bend the stem with one button
2016-05-17 16:19:13	@Espyo	it's us, and that's about it
2016-05-17 16:19:22	@Espyo	awesome
2016-05-17 16:19:23	@Espyo	very awesome
2016-05-17 16:19:36	@Espyo	you're making me want to create something
2016-05-17 16:19:43	@Espyo	I've spent a whole week without working on the engine, and I'm really itching
2016-05-17 16:19:48	@Espyo	closest I've gotten was making a map on Mario Maker
2016-05-17 16:19:54	Scruffy	Thank you!
2016-05-17 16:19:55	Scruffy	Hehe
2016-05-17 16:20:05	Yoshi2	I feel like it's worse with battalion wars, but on the other hand BW is also much more simple than pikmin
2016-05-17 16:20:23	@Espyo	is it?
2016-05-17 16:20:23	Scruffy	Oh, I have to get going to bed for now
2016-05-17 16:20:29	@Espyo	I wouldn't imagine a strategy game to be simpler than Pikmin
2016-05-17 16:20:32	Scruffy	But glad I could update you guys!
2016-05-17 16:20:34	@Espyo	but then again, Pikmin is pretty janky...
2016-05-17 16:20:41	@Espyo	glad you could find the time to let us know!
2016-05-17 16:20:46	@Espyo	and good to know all's going well over there
2016-05-17 16:20:47	Scruffy	Yep! :D
2016-05-17 16:20:52	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-17 16:20:54	@Espyo	I'm pretty hyped
2016-05-17 16:21:04	Scruffy	I'll be arriving back on the 25th
2016-05-17 16:21:05	@Espyo	night
2016-05-17 16:21:12	@Espyo	oh, gotcha
2016-05-17 16:21:12	Scruffy	Night!
2016-05-17 16:21:18	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-17 16:21:26	Scruffy	So, talk to you guys soon
2016-05-17 16:21:30	Yoshi2	see ya

2016-05-17 16:22:12	Yoshi2	Espyo: battalion wars levels are purely powered by Lua, that's how simple it is
2016-05-17 16:22:19	@Espyo	good point
2016-05-17 16:23:27	Yoshi2	the engine itself probably only defines the behaviour of all units and the AI
2016-05-17 16:23:42	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-17 16:25:54	Yoshi2	all messages, objectives, unit respawning and having units attack is done in Lua
2016-05-17 16:26:04	Yoshi2	the developers did all sorts of things to speed development up
2016-05-17 16:27:29	@Espyo	yeah, pretty smart

2016-05-17 17:03:08	Yoshi2	recording voice lines is quite a bit of work, I need at least several takes per line to get it right
2016-05-17 17:09:02	Marty2000	Hi PikFan

2016-05-17 17:10:06	@PikFan	?
2016-05-17 17:10:09	@Espyo	but are you replacing all of them?
2016-05-17 17:16:15	@Espyo	Marty2000: I'm gonna try my take on the section on the Treasure article that explains the dynamic weight change
2016-05-17 17:16:18	@Espyo	but I'll explain my changes
2016-05-17 17:16:22	@Espyo	not to explain why you're wrong
2016-05-17 17:16:29	@Espyo	but to explain what my reasoning is
2016-05-17 17:16:41	@Espyo	I hate leaving behind the feeling that, when I make an edit, I'm just trying to one-up the previous editor

2016-05-17 17:16:57	@Espyo	when in reality I just want to see the articles be clean and useful
2016-05-17 17:17:08	@Espyo	for one thing, I'll change the title of the section to something like "dynamic weights"
2016-05-17 17:17:22	@Espyo	because the treasures don't have different requirements
2016-05-17 17:17:25	@Espyo	they have normal requirements
2016-05-17 17:17:32	@Espyo	but special cases for when the player lost too many
2016-05-17 17:17:36	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-17 17:17:36	Yoshi2	I'm replacing as many as I need to mention some trivia about custom audio in the game
2016-05-17 17:17:45	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-05-17 17:18:17	@Espyo	also, on the list of treasures, I'll create links to the Prototype Detector and the Five-man Napskac
2016-05-17 17:18:19	@Espyo	*Napsack
2016-05-17 17:18:33	@Espyo	because people who enter that section may not care about the rest of the article (nor do they need to)
2016-05-17 17:18:38	@Espyo	and they'll be weirded out by the lack of links on those two
2016-05-17 17:18:44	Marty2000	Oh yeah, I didn't put them because of that 
2016-05-17 17:18:55	Marty2000	I wasn't sure if I had to put them twice
2016-05-17 17:18:59	@Espyo	yeah, but I feel it's better to have them
2016-05-17 17:19:02	Marty2000	So I left as it is
2016-05-17 17:19:05	Marty2000	Yes, same
2016-05-17 17:19:11	@Espyo	I'm not 100% sure on the way Wikipedia does it, but it's something like...
2016-05-17 17:19:21	@Espyo	avoid having the same link twice in the same section
2016-05-17 17:19:33	@Espyo	and on the next sections too, if they're related
2016-05-17 17:19:38	@Espyo	if not, you can "reset" your links
2016-05-17 17:19:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-17 17:19:51	@Espyo	instead of thinking of this like weird rules
2016-05-17 17:20:05	@Espyo	we can try thinking of this over how useful it is for the readers and editors
2016-05-17 17:20:20	@Espyo	I know I sometimes go on a Wikipedia page and jump straight to the section I want
2016-05-17 17:20:24	Marty2000	Oh, I don't think it's weird rules, though... it's just rules
2016-05-17 17:20:35	@Espyo	without reading the previous parts of the article
2016-05-17 17:20:37	Marty2000	It would be useful
2016-05-17 17:20:46	@Espyo	so for me, having links to everything there is helpful
2016-05-17 17:20:57	@Espyo	but if you're on a section on an article which you're expected to read everything in
2016-05-17 17:21:00	Marty2000	So do I for some articles on Pikipedia
2016-05-17 17:21:02	@Espyo	then it makes sense to only have links the first few times
2016-05-17 17:21:08	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-17 17:21:14	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-17 17:21:15	@Espyo	well, either way, I don't think it needs to be over-thought that much
2016-05-17 17:21:31	@Espyo	honestly, we can't even afford to be worrying about these luxuries
2016-05-17 17:21:35	@Espyo	we still have some basic stuff missing
2016-05-17 17:21:44	@Espyo	the Bingo Battle stage articles, for one, are pretty empty :/

2016-05-17 17:21:57	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-05-17 17:22:11	Marty2000	I could work on them if you think it's important to fill them
2016-05-17 17:22:15	@PikFan	sorry to interrupt, but what are you talking about?
2016-05-17 17:22:32	@Espyo	well, I think it's one of the most important things to do
2016-05-17 17:22:35	Marty2000	He he, worry not PikFan ;) Look that
2016-05-17 17:22:39	@Espyo	since a lot of the tasks we have are just "this info would be neat to have"
2016-05-17 17:22:48	@Espyo	whereas filling in missing Bingo Battle info is... well, mandatory

2016-05-17 17:23:14	@Espyo	PikFan: TL;DR: Marty found all treasures that decrease weight; I'm rewording that section on the article and explaining why
2016-05-17 17:23:17	@Espyo	cool
2016-05-17 17:23:33	@Espyo	I played some Bingo Battle while I was in the UK
2016-05-17 17:23:36	@Espyo	so it's still a bit fresh in my mind
2016-05-17 17:23:41	@Espyo	kinda sad to see so much info missing...

2016-05-17 17:26:52	Marty2000	I do think it's for the better, because as an example, I don't know much about technical information concerning the Wikis...
2016-05-17 17:26:58	@PikFan	I probably wouldn't think that way if I wasn't such a perfectionist
2016-05-17 17:27:43	@Espyo	that's just it, there is no "perfect" on an article, though
2016-05-17 17:27:50	@Espyo	the way stuff is written is always subjective in terms of quality
2016-05-17 17:28:06	@Espyo	yeah, I like to think I give others some relief when I make edits on top of them, too
2016-05-17 17:28:13	@Espyo	since they can make the edit without caring about details
2016-05-17 17:28:20	@Espyo	because they'll know I'll come along and fix everything for the better
2016-05-17 17:28:22	@Espyo	everybody wins
2016-05-17 17:28:30	@PikFan	I say to myself "oh, I left out such a tiny thing that doesn't follow this obscure policy, so my edit's useless"
2016-05-17 17:28:35	@PikFan	I know, my thinking is flawed
2016-05-17 17:28:45	@Espyo	maybe you'll grow out of it?
2016-05-17 17:28:45	@PikFan	but that's how I honestly feel
2016-05-17 17:29:07	@Espyo	but at least try to avoid thinking like that
2016-05-17 17:29:12	@Espyo	plus, that's already why I added Pikan and the like
2016-05-17 17:29:21	@Espyo	all the policies that DO matter are covered by Pikan...and common sense
2016-05-17 17:29:37	@Espyo	the rest are just "hey, we should do stuff like this so that it's clean, but if we don't, who cares, the readers can still perfectly enjoy the article"
2016-05-17 17:29:41	@PikFan	and let's face it: I'm overly-wordy
2016-05-17 17:29:55	@PikFan	I write confusing text
2016-05-17 17:30:02	@PikFan	but the text you write is so...natural
2016-05-17 17:30:19	@Espyo	and actually, I think the policies are mostly there to help us not forget stuff
2016-05-17 17:30:20	@Espyo	like
2016-05-17 17:30:24	@Espyo	if you want to write about an area in Pikmin 4
2016-05-17 17:30:27	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-05-17 17:30:32	@PikFan	you've told me that before
2016-05-17 17:30:33	@Espyo	you can write...about its appearance...landmarks...and that's about it
2016-05-17 17:30:35	Marty2000	PikFan: your text can' be as confusing as me, lol
2016-05-17 17:30:37	@Espyo	with the policy, you've got a list
2016-05-17 17:30:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-17 17:30:39	Marty2000	can't*
2016-05-17 17:30:43	@Espyo	yeah, about that, PikFan...
2016-05-17 17:30:45	@Espyo	it's not really true
2016-05-17 17:30:55	Marty2000	mine*
2016-05-17 17:30:56	@Espyo	I guess the text I write is pretty all right
2016-05-17 17:30:56	Marty2000	See
2016-05-17 17:31:03	@Espyo	but whenever it's something like a policy, and I ask for feedback
2016-05-17 17:31:09	@Espyo	it always returns as "too long and confusing"
2016-05-17 17:31:13	@Espyo	especially by J
2016-05-17 17:31:20	@Espyo	writing text is no exact science
2016-05-17 17:31:37	@Espyo	so all the more reasons why you shouldn't think like that

2016-05-17 17:34:11	Marty2000	Hey, don't worry. I think it's better if you can add information about something: even if the edit does not respect the policy someone might eventually clean it up... while there won't be any clean-up nor any wiki if there's no information
2016-05-17 17:34:19	Marty2000	Well, that's just my point of view...
2016-05-17 17:34:44	@PikFan	I agree

2016-05-17 17:35:59	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-17 17:36:08	@Espyo	also, if you want an easy solution to this:
2016-05-17 17:36:16	@Espyo	ALWAYS make an edit
2016-05-17 17:36:27	@Espyo	it could be worse
2016-05-17 17:36:29	@Espyo	it could be a wikia edit
2016-05-17 17:36:46	@PikFan	speaking of, any new shenanigans over there?
2016-05-17 17:37:31	@Espyo	affiliations being handled like a newborn being transported via catapults

2016-05-17 17:38:32	Marty2000	The only thing that made me laugh is the image of a ladle they uploaded some time ago: we uploaded the exact same on Pikipedia before and it has the same name
2016-05-17 17:38:41	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-17 17:38:52	Marty2000	I was wondering if it could be a coincidence

2016-05-17 17:47:07	@Espyo	walkthroughs are so...non-wikiish
2016-05-17 17:48:22	Marty2000	Yes they all do

2016-05-17 17:50:36	@Espyo	different treasures have different names and/or different locations in different regions AND in different releases
2016-05-17 17:50:38	@Espyo	thanks Nintendo
2016-05-17 17:50:45	@Espyo	I don't think you could've made that any harder to organize if you trie

2016-05-17 17:50:45	@Espyo	*d
2016-05-17 17:51:10	Marty2000	Not to mention they make "mistakes" in certain versions...
2016-05-17 17:51:31	Marty2000	And having different names and descriptions depending on the version is also strange
2016-05-17 17:51:35	Marty2000	Yet I find this funny
2016-05-17 17:52:10	Marty2000	Well, I'm talking about when the treasures are identical
2016-05-17 17:52:22	Marty2000	If they're different, sure the name and description can be different
2016-05-17 17:53:40	Marty2000	Ah, by the way, Espyo, how do you delete an image that was uploaded to the wiki? I guess you press "edit" and delete everything, but I wanna make sure

2016-05-17 18:09:09	@Espyo	like one or two obvious sections are missing...

2016-05-17 18:11:41	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-17 18:12:04	@Espyo	like how in Shaded Terrace, there are aisles on the sides to go to the other player's base
2016-05-17 18:12:14	@Espyo	but also the center of the stage, which is covered by a Bulborb, or gate

2016-05-17 18:12:22	Marty2000	Okay

2016-05-17 19:45:52	Nvortex	i think it should be a rule that creature images should be taken with the koppad for better detail and focus on the creature, of course there could be exceptions, maybe taking a screenshot and not a koppad picture is required to appreciate what's going on or something

2016-05-17 20:13:34	StarWolf	Hey, I'm encountering a problem with the file uploader... 
2016-05-17 20:14:03	@Espyo	oh?
2016-05-17 20:14:30	StarWolf	when ever I try to update an image, it doesn
2016-05-17 20:14:54	StarWolf	*doesn't and gives me the message 400.shtml
2016-05-17 20:17:22	@Espyo	that really doesn't sound right
2016-05-17 20:17:26	@Espyo	can you do ctrl+f5 on the upload page?
2016-05-17 20:18:06	StarWolf	it still has the same image
2016-05-17 20:18:13	StarWolf	*message
2016-05-17 20:19:06	@Espyo	is this on [[Special:Upload]] itself, or do you get this after you select an image and choose to upload?

2016-05-17 20:19:43	StarWolf	I selected the image to update it
2016-05-17 20:20:38	@Espyo	ah, so you opened an image, and clicked on the link that goes something like "upload a new version of this image"?
2016-05-17 20:20:45	StarWolf	yes
2016-05-17 20:20:52	@Espyo	all right, let me give it a try
2016-05-17 20:20:58	@Espyo	we might have to report this to Porplemontage
2016-05-17 20:21:27	StarWolf	okay
2016-05-17 20:21:42	@Espyo	hm, that page works fine for me
2016-05-17 20:21:57	StarWolf	are you on the Fannon? 
2016-05-17 20:22:00	@Espyo	oh, no
2016-05-17 20:22:04	@Espyo	I'm on Pikipedia
2016-05-17 20:22:11	@Espyo	let me try there
2016-05-17 20:23:09	@Espyo	hm, even still, everything works fine for me
2016-05-17 20:23:35	@Espyo	do you even get to see the upload form (the part that asks you for what changes you made to the image and such), or do you only get the error after clicking Upload file after the form?
2016-05-17 20:25:00	StarWolf	I'm not sure what you're asking, but the page looks fine until I click "Upload File" 
2016-05-17 20:25:40	@Espyo	ok, that's what I need
2016-05-17 20:25:52	@Espyo	sounds like a general uploading problem
2016-05-17 20:25:55	@Espyo	I'll upload a test image
2016-05-17 20:26:32	StarWolf	okay
2016-05-17 20:27:16	@Espyo	ok, a normal upload works
2016-05-17 20:27:18	@Espyo	let me try a replace
2016-05-17 20:27:22	@Espyo	what image are you trying to replace?
2016-05-17 20:27:24	@Espyo	might be a specific image
2016-05-17 20:27:31	@Espyo	which is dumb... but hey, possible

2016-05-17 20:30:24	@Espyo	ok, might be a problem with your image
2016-05-17 20:30:26	@Espyo	how big is it?
2016-05-17 20:30:50	@Espyo	if you right-click it, you can see the file size
2016-05-17 20:31:03	@Espyo	if it's over 5 MB, it's probably too big
2016-05-17 20:31:28	StarWolf	the new one is 49 KB
2016-05-17 20:31:48	@Espyo	ok, that's pretty small
2016-05-17 20:31:53	StarWolf	the old is 119 KB
2016-05-17 20:32:15	@Espyo	is the new one also a .jpg file? the wiki might stress out if you're uploading a .png over a .jpg
2016-05-17 20:32:31	Marty2000	Oh yes
2016-05-17 20:32:36	Marty2000	It happened to me

2016-05-17 20:33:06	@Espyo	hm... but I tried to upload a png before, and it gave me a normal error
2016-05-17 20:33:10	@Espyo	instead of a weird broken error
2016-05-17 20:33:15	Marty2000	You can't upload a new ersion of a file it it's not the same format
2016-05-17 20:33:19	Marty2000	At least I can't
2016-05-17 20:33:24	@Espyo	yep, nobody can
2016-05-17 20:33:54	StarWolf	So I just upload the image as a new image?
2016-05-17 20:34:14	Marty2000	Hmm, if you wanna replace, just convert the image
2016-05-17 20:34:22	Marty2000	into the same format as the old one
2016-05-17 20:35:33	StarWolf	I don't know how to do that...
2016-05-17 20:35:42	Marty2000	Use Paint
2016-05-17 20:35:48	Marty2000	Open your image with Paint
2016-05-17 20:35:52	Marty2000	"Save as"
2016-05-17 20:35:58	Marty2000	And choose your format ;)

2016-05-17 20:50:26	@Espyo	well, you can try uploading as a new image, I guess...
2016-05-17 20:50:34	@Espyo	pretty weird, since I'm not getting any error
2016-05-17 20:54:41	StarWolf	that's what i did: uploaded it as a new image
2016-05-17 20:55:48	@Espyo	still an error, huh

2016-05-17 21:00:53	@Espyo	pretty weird... I could upload just fine
2016-05-17 21:00:59	@Espyo	try a different browser, maybe?
2016-05-17 21:01:04	@Espyo	also, try logging out and logging back in
2016-05-17 21:01:21	@Espyo	maybe you're technically logged out, but you're seeing the pages as if you're logged in
2016-05-17 21:01:27	@Espyo	so when it's time to actually do the upload, it gets an error
2016-05-17 21:01:52	Marty2000	Delicacy=Délice
2016-05-17 21:02:06	Marty2000	Doesn't really sound the same to me, but might work
2016-05-17 21:02:12	Marty2000	I'd prefer to use Délicatesse instead
2016-05-17 21:02:18	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-17 21:02:20	Marty2000	But Delicacy may work as well
2016-05-17 21:02:34	Marty2000	It's just quite different
2016-05-17 21:03:32	Marty2000	Hmm, weird question, but are you using Google Chrome with Tampermonkey?
2016-05-17 21:05:02	StarWolf	what's tampermonkey?
2016-05-17 21:05:26	Marty2000	Well, I guess you're not using it then. ;)
2016-05-17 21:05:46	StarWolf	It's still bugging out, and I have no other browsers
2016-05-17 21:05:49	Marty2000	It's a userscript manager
2016-05-17 21:06:06	@Espyo	have you tried logging out/in?
2016-05-17 21:06:06	Marty2000	Hmm... what is the image you want to replace?

2016-05-17 21:16:05	Marty2000	The word should be a single one, but they put - because of the text box...
2016-05-17 21:16:11	Marty2000	I think that's it
2016-05-17 21:17:39	@Espyo	why should it be all together?
2016-05-17 21:18:18	Marty2000	Seems logical to me... but if you think the contrary, you can remove the note
2016-05-17 21:18:37	@Espyo	I just don't see why
2016-05-17 21:20:34	Marty2000	How to say... if I remember, if you add -super to a word in S, you shouldn't make -super and the word separated
2016-05-17 21:20:39	Marty2000	Seems like it to me
2016-05-17 21:20:45	Marty2000	I'll verify...
2016-05-17 21:21:00	@Espyo	not sure

2016-05-17 21:31:17	Nvortex	i honestly think that should be left there
2016-05-17 21:31:17	@Espyo	so... there's not enough space to put it all together, but there is space to add an extra - ?

2016-05-17 21:38:34	Marty2000	Plus it's written exactly the same in the American version, but without the "-" (and ú instead of u for "super")
2016-05-17 21:39:06	Marty2000	If they added a "-" in the European version, maybe it's because it was meant to be a single word here

2016-05-17 21:57:56	@Espyo	it's less characters
2016-05-17 21:58:34	@Espyo	if "Super-estabilizador" (19 characters) fits, then "Superestabilizador" (18 characters) has to fit
2016-05-17 21:59:10	@Espyo	also, when the European and American versions differ, you can use SpaE and SpaA
2016-05-17 21:59:23	Marty1401	I see
2016-05-17 22:00:17	Marty1401	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/20/1463518758-desmoralizador.png This one, for example. You wouldn't write "desmora-lizador" but desmoralizador. There's just a lack of space, so they put "-". Well, it might also change because of the "super"é
2016-05-17 22:00:21	Marty1401	"super"
2016-05-17 22:01:01	@Espyo	oh, because of the line breaks
2016-05-17 22:01:04	@Espyo	that explains that
2016-05-17 22:01:06	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-17 22:01:11	@Espyo	what about when you collect the treasure proper?
2016-05-17 22:01:43	Marty1401	Ah... I could check, I just have to restart the game on my Wii :p
2016-05-17 22:01:52	Marty1401	I'll do
2016-05-17 22:01:54	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-17 22:01:58	@Espyo	you might not need to
2016-05-17 22:01:59	@Espyo	gimme a sec
2016-05-17 22:02:01	@Espyo	I have the files
2016-05-17 22:02:04	Marty1401	Okay
2016-05-17 22:02:43	@Espyo	oh, I don't have PAL NPC!P2
2016-05-17 22:02:45	@Espyo	only US
2016-05-17 22:02:54	Marty1401	US is separate anyway
2016-05-17 22:03:05	Marty1401	So we need to check for the PAL version...
2016-05-17 22:03:10	Marty1401	I'll see what I can do
2016-05-17 22:03:17	@Espyo	I don't think you need it

2016-05-17 22:03:27	@Espyo	seems obvious to me then that the hyphen is for line breaks only
2016-05-17 22:03:28	Marty1401	I want to make sure now
2016-05-17 22:03:43	@Espyo	meaning it really is superestabilizador
2016-05-17 22:03:53	@Espyo	you can check anyway if you want
2016-05-17 22:04:13	Marty1401	I'll do, so we'll be really sure
2016-05-17 22:04:42	Marty1401	I need to start from Day 2, though... Hmm... Day 3, Whites, Day 4, Yellow, Day 5, Blues, Day 6, Valley of Repose
2016-05-17 22:04:46	Marty1401	Might take an hour
2016-05-17 22:04:55	Marty1401	Yellow*
2016-05-17 22:05:12	Marty1401	It's in the Subterranean Complex, right?
2016-05-17 22:05:46	@Espyo	right
2016-05-17 22:05:50	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-17 22:06:20	@Espyo	the game files in US NPC!P2 have "Súper estabilizador"
2016-05-17 22:06:26	Marty1401	Yes
2016-05-17 22:06:28	Marty1401	As I said
2016-05-17 22:06:28	@Espyo	oh, never mind
2016-05-17 22:06:33	@Espyo	yeah, as you said
2016-05-17 22:06:33	Marty1401	It's separate here ;)
2016-05-17 22:06:48	@Espyo	lemme check GC P2
2016-05-17 22:06:51	Marty1401	separated*
2016-05-17 22:06:53	Marty1401	Okay
2016-05-17 22:07:28	@Espyo	it has a hyphen
2016-05-17 22:07:35	@Espyo	and it doesn't seem like the hyphen is because of a line break
2016-05-17 22:07:38	@Espyo	since no other treasure has that
2016-05-17 22:07:43	@Espyo	seems like the hyphen is part of the name
2016-05-17 22:07:47	Marty1401	Oh
2016-05-17 22:07:49	Marty1401	Well...
2016-05-17 22:07:52	@Espyo	they COULD have made it that way so that it fits on the Piklopedia
2016-05-17 22:07:53	Marty1401	I see
2016-05-17 22:08:02	@Espyo	but doesn't the Piklopedia shrink the name if it's too long?
2016-05-17 22:08:22	Marty1401	I think it doesn't, but not sure
2016-05-17 22:08:28	Marty1401	Well, I'll verify in-game anyway

2016-05-17 22:08:34	Marty1401	I forgot to change the language
2016-05-17 22:08:36	@Espyo	these names are pretty big
2016-05-17 22:08:54	Marty1401	Yeah
2016-05-17 22:09:00	@Espyo	Crystallized Clairvoyance
2016-05-17 22:09:24	@Espyo	I'll check if it squashes
2016-05-17 22:09:41	Marty1401	Okay
2016-05-17 22:09:51	@Espyo	nope, it doesn't
2016-05-17 22:09:59	Nvortex	dude
2016-05-17 22:10:02	@Espyo	at least, no name is big enough (on a single line) to show it being compressed
2016-05-17 22:10:18	Nvortex	the - is used when a word beyond the page
2016-05-17 22:10:36	@Espyo	yeah, we know
2016-05-17 22:11:04	@Espyo	but you can't really be sure if the word is "Superestabilizador", but with a hyphen in the middle because of the line break... or if it's "Super-estabilizador" on purpose so that it breaks nicely
2016-05-17 22:11:11	Nvortex	are you trying to 
2016-05-17 22:11:15	Nvortex	ok
2016-05-17 22:11:29	@Espyo	the game files literally have its name as "Super-<line break character>estabilizador"
2016-05-17 22:11:38	@Espyo	and these names appear twice, so...
2016-05-17 22:11:45	@Espyo	I'm guessing the Piklopedia and the collection cutscene?
2016-05-17 22:12:25	Marty1401	I'll use a faster way, Espyo
2016-05-17 22:12:25	@Espyo	it honestly could be either one
2016-05-17 22:12:28	Marty1401	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXnzEP9yb_4 Videos
2016-05-17 22:12:35	@Espyo	oh, good idea
2016-05-17 22:12:44	@Espyo	when writing prose, you ARE meant to use a hyphen to break a word if it runs over a line
2016-05-17 22:12:48	@Espyo	but these are titles, not prose
2016-05-17 22:12:52	@Espyo	so you just use whatever
2016-05-17 22:12:58	@Espyo	who knows what they meant
2016-05-17 22:14:14	Marty1401	I just hope the guy is using the American version
2016-05-17 22:14:22	Marty1401	The European*
2016-05-17 22:14:26	Marty1401	( :/)
2016-05-17 22:14:39	@Espyo	to confuse stuff further, I was always taught that when you break a hyphenated word between different lines, you're meant to put a hyphen at the end of the first line AND start of the second
2016-05-17 22:17:57	Marty1401	Hmm...
2016-05-17 22:18:01	Marty1401	It's different between languages
2016-05-17 22:18:09	Marty1401	In French, you can use one or two
2016-05-17 22:18:17	Marty1401	And you can choose where to put it now
2016-05-17 22:18:23	Marty1401	That wasn't the case some time ago
2016-05-17 22:18:54	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-17 22:19:17	Marty1401	Some French teachers still consider that you need only one (first line)
2016-05-17 22:20:02	Marty1401	Well, it's really complicated because we also had changes about how to write words some months ago... but those reforms are just mocked
2016-05-17 22:20:09	Marty1401	Some words
2016-05-17 22:20:26	Marty1401	They try to find a way to delete accents like ^ from some words
2016-05-17 22:21:46	Marty1401	...
2016-05-17 22:21:54	Marty1401	I think
2016-05-17 22:21:56	Marty1401	We're just

2016-05-17 22:22:35	Marty1401	:/
2016-05-17 22:22:55	Marty1401	We can't really know
2016-05-17 22:23:53	Marty1401	I guess you could remove the note and write super-estabilizador, if you wish to
2016-05-17 22:24:51	@Espyo	right
2016-05-17 22:24:53	@Espyo	I'll add a note
2016-05-17 22:25:53	Marty1401	Okay
2016-05-17 22:27:13	Marty1401	Hmm, by the way, would you do a favour fore me please? Is it possible to kick that Marty2000 out of the channel so that I can connect with the nickname again? Thanks
2016-05-17 22:27:23	@Espyo	that'll do
2016-05-17 22:27:33	@Espyo	actually, it doesn't work that way
2016-05-17 22:27:36	@Espyo	you'll have to wait for a timeout
2016-05-17 22:27:41	@Espyo	I can kick that ghost out
2016-05-17 22:27:44	Marty1401	Hmm...
2016-05-17 22:27:44	@Espyo	but you'll still be on the network
2016-05-17 22:27:47	@Espyo	just not on the channel
2016-05-17 22:27:52	@Espyo	I think there is a ghost command you can do
2016-05-17 22:28:04	@Espyo	do /ghost Marty2000 <password>, I think
2016-05-17 22:28:12	Marty1401	Thanks, I'll try
2016-05-17 22:28:14	@Espyo	I mean, if you have an account on the network
2016-05-17 22:28:52	Marty1401	Wait, I'll try something
2016-05-17 22:28:56	Marty1401	Be right back...

2016-05-17 22:30:33	Marty2001	WHy is it still here...? Cleared my history, close my browser....
2016-05-17 22:30:42	@Espyo	it's on the network
2016-05-17 22:30:49	@Espyo	simply put, the way it works is
2016-05-17 22:30:49	Marty2001	Marty1401 got disconnected, but not the 2000 one. :/
2016-05-17 22:31:09	@Espyo	your computer sends a message to irc.darkmyst.org saying "please add a user called Marty2000"
2016-05-17 22:31:13	@Espyo	it does so, and that user is on the network
2016-05-17 22:31:24	@Espyo	you communicate between channels and receive stuff from this connection
2016-05-17 22:31:41	@Espyo	in order for the network to make sure that the user that requested this "Marty2000" is still online, it periodically sends pings
2016-05-17 22:31:45	@Espyo	your machine replies with pongs
2016-05-17 22:31:51	@Espyo	if it doesn't reply with pongs... well, it's dead
2016-05-17 22:32:07	@Espyo	so the network just removes the user, since they clearly disconnected
2016-05-17 22:32:20	Marty2001	Hmm, well, I guess it'll be solved later
2016-05-17 22:32:21	@Espyo	so if you don't have any more connections linked to "Marty2000", there should be no replies to the pings
2016-05-17 22:32:21	Marty2001	Thanks
2016-05-17 22:32:31	@Espyo	meaning the server should be disconnecting this "ghost" user any time soon
2016-05-17 22:36:14	Marty2001	By the way, I didn't know you could add (NOE).... that's great, we'll have to change every name :)
2016-05-17 22:36:36	Marty2001	I'll do tomorrow if you want, I'll try to add the Italian or German names

2016-05-17 22:40:19	@Espyo	yikes, yeah...
2016-05-17 22:40:34	@Espyo	well, if it's the same in the American AND European releases, just use |Fre = or |Ita=
2016-05-17 22:40:45	@Espyo	instead of adding the same to both |FreA and |FreE
2016-05-17 22:40:50	Marty2001	I thought so at first
2016-05-17 22:40:52	Marty2001	But then
2016-05-17 22:41:07	Marty2001	I wondered if people wouldn't be confused or wondering if the names are the same or different
2016-05-17 22:41:34	Marty2001	So that's why I preferred to add NOA and NOE even when they were the same
2016-05-17 22:41:48	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-17 22:41:50	@Espyo	I see
2016-05-17 22:41:56	@Espyo	we should add a way to differentiate
2016-05-17 22:43:19	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlKNswNsA what
2016-05-17 22:44:11	Marty2001	For unknown reasons
2016-05-17 22:44:21	Marty2001	It reminded of a film https://d.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1448732125ra/17181558.gif
2016-05-17 22:45:02	Marty2001	Maybe she thinks it's Captain Olimar because the three Koppaites think he's really Olimar, whereas he's Louie
2016-05-17 22:45:16	@Espyo	lol

2016-05-17 22:45:58	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlLw3-mPg oh?
2016-05-17 22:46:02	@Espyo	wanna give this one a try?
2016-05-17 22:46:38	Marty2001	They always walk the first time (so when the cutscene triggers)
2016-05-17 22:47:09	Marty2001	If you prefer
2016-05-17 22:47:13	Marty2001	When that cutscene triggers
2016-05-17 22:47:17	Marty2001	They won't run
2016-05-17 22:47:19	Marty2001	Only walk
2016-05-17 22:47:22	@Espyo	what
2016-05-17 22:47:25	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right
2016-05-17 22:47:40	Marty2001	And start running once it has played
2016-05-17 22:47:47	Marty2001	(the cutscene)
2016-05-17 22:47:59	@Espyo	shouldn't the cutscene show them running?
2016-05-17 22:48:02	@Espyo	since they're panicking and all...
2016-05-17 22:48:06	Marty2001	No...
2016-05-17 22:48:09	Marty2001	Yes
2016-05-17 22:48:14	Marty2001	But during that cutscene
2016-05-17 22:48:18	Marty2001	They always walk
2016-05-17 22:48:24	Marty2001	I haven't tested with Winged Pikmin
2016-05-17 22:48:29	Marty2001	But I'm sure
2016-05-17 22:48:32	Marty2001	I can recall it
2016-05-17 22:50:09	Marty2001	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/f0/Montage_Winged_fire.png
2016-05-17 22:50:18	Marty2001	You know, that's very funny they have two diffrent animations
2016-05-17 22:50:28	Marty2001	But actually, they work the same
2016-05-17 22:50:47	Marty2001	In that a Winged Pikmin will still fly above water if running
2016-05-17 22:50:55	Marty2001	different*
2016-05-17 22:52:00	@Espyo	that is very bizarre
2016-05-17 22:52:23	@Espyo	I guess they walk to make sure they don't run off too far during the cutscene, otherwise the player can't catch them
2016-05-17 22:52:24	@Espyo	but eesh
2016-05-17 22:52:34	@Espyo	they're on fire, and just casually walking about?
2016-05-17 22:52:39	@Espyo	that's dumb
2016-05-17 22:52:41	Marty2001	I know how to get that running animation on purpose
2016-05-17 22:52:49	Marty2001	Normally, when catching on fire
2016-05-17 22:52:51	Marty2001	They always fly
2016-05-17 22:53:05	Marty2001	But if they have touched ground before, then they will run. Example
2016-05-17 22:53:34	Marty2001	You throw a Winged Pikmin at the ground, close to a Puffy Blowhog so it will attack the latter
2016-05-17 22:53:49	Marty2001	When the WInged Pikmin catches on fire because of the Blwohog
2016-05-17 22:53:51	Marty2001	Fiery Blowhog*
2016-05-17 22:53:53	Marty2001	Sorry
2016-05-17 22:53:56	Marty2001	So...
2016-05-17 22:54:07	Marty2001	 When the WInged Pikmin catches on fire because of the Blowhog
2016-05-17 22:54:12	Marty2001	It won't fly, but run instead
2016-05-17 22:54:15	Marty2001	I don't know why
2016-05-17 22:54:19	Marty2001	But that's how it works
2016-05-17 22:56:18	Marty2001	Same for the Watery Blowhog
2016-05-17 22:56:20	Marty2001	And ink
2016-05-17 22:58:02	Marty2001	Just discovered that only flowered Winged Pikmin had that animation
2016-05-17 22:58:09	Marty2001	Well, maybe bud ones too
2016-05-17 22:58:18	Marty2001	But those with a leaf will alwyas fly...
2016-05-17 22:58:21	Marty2001	always*
2016-05-17 22:59:43	@Espyo	right
2016-05-17 22:59:49	@Espyo	WOAH https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlK_OjUlQ
2016-05-17 23:00:16	Marty2001	Yep
2016-05-17 23:00:37	@Espyo	I know they go farther with fire
2016-05-17 23:00:40	@Espyo	you studied that well enough
2016-05-17 23:00:44	@Espyo	but THAT FAR?!
2016-05-17 23:01:00	Marty2001	Wow, I didn't see the comments firsthand
2016-05-17 23:01:03	@Espyo	do they just go farther with Watery Blowhogs, or did you just never try to use the glitch to its full potential?
2016-05-17 23:01:04	Marty2001	That's incredible...
2016-05-17 23:01:09	@Espyo	oh, that explains it
2016-05-17 23:01:10	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-17 23:01:10	Marty2001	They do
2016-05-17 23:01:13	Marty2001	That works the same
2016-05-17 23:01:23	Marty2001	Fire or water, it doesn't depend on the hazard
2016-05-17 23:01:27	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-17 23:01:38	Marty2001	But I didn't know you could use that glitch to throw them out of bounds
2016-05-17 23:01:45	@Espyo	I guess it makes sense...
2016-05-17 23:01:50	@Espyo	aim the cursor as far away as you can
2016-05-17 23:01:54	@Espyo	and let 'er rip
2016-05-17 23:02:01	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlKu_Jv1Q also, what
2016-05-17 23:02:20	Marty2001	Hmm... 
2016-05-17 23:12:25	Marty2001	Oh by the way, Espyo, about the glitched a. Cannon Larva... since we can stun that glitchy buried version, I wanted to know if you think it might be the same enemy, or the same as the buried one (because internally, the walking and buried versions have different names)
2016-05-17 23:13:22	Marty2001	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Armored_Cannon_Larva#Technical_information It's also surprising that you can theoretically stun the regular buried version... but it never happens in-game
2016-05-17 23:14:08	Marty2001	I mean, it is defined that you can stun it, but you just can't in-game... which is now possible with the glitched version
2016-05-17 23:14:39	Marty2001	adly, I'm playing on Wii, so I cannot check the game to see what happens to that particular larva
2016-05-17 23:14:41	Marty2001	:/
2016-05-17 23:16:38	@Espyo	I'm honestly not sure what to think
2016-05-17 23:16:46	@Espyo	I wasn't paying full attention when you made the discovery, since I was in the UK
2016-05-17 23:16:51	@Espyo	and right now I'm pretty tired and watching a video
2016-05-17 23:16:56	@Espyo	so I'll think more strongly about this tomorrow
2016-05-17 23:17:00	@Espyo	but man, it's a real brain-teasre
2016-05-17 23:17:01	@Espyo	*teaser
2016-05-17 23:17:46	Marty2001	Oh, that wasn't mandatory to check, don't worry. It's just surprising that it has different properties... And yeah, you're right
2016-05-17 23:18:20	Marty2001	I just know that you need to get it out of its "territory" to make the glitch work 
2016-05-17 23:18:27	Marty2001	Using sprays, legdes, walls...

2016-05-18 12:25:34	Marty2000	Hmm... I should have left a message for UltraMario that morning, but well, I guess he'll connect later... So, there is going to be an update for SSB4
2016-05-18 12:26:05	Marty2000	And I think it will remove the possibility to add custom musics

2016-05-18 21:21:07	Yoshi2	I figured out how to have my voice lines play for a longer time, woohoo
2016-05-18 21:21:23	Yoshi2	turns out that value I was trying to modify was actually a 32 bit float
2016-05-18 21:21:28	Marty2000	Congratulations! How much time can you "add"?
2016-05-18 21:21:58	Yoshi2	more than necessary
2016-05-18 21:22:09	Yoshi2	unlike with music files, the voice files have no upper limit, I think

2016-05-19 00:52:48	@PikFan	I got out of there when you bubbled up
2016-05-19 00:53:05	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-19 00:53:17	Marty2000	As soon as I see a teammate, if I judge it's good, I bubble
2016-05-19 00:56:30	@PikFan	I partied at the end because we were going to lose anyway :P
2016-05-19 00:56:36	Marty2000	Did you have a disconnect?

2016-05-19 01:00:59	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-19 01:01:09	Marty2000	I think I'm better suited to this role
2016-05-19 01:01:10	@PikFan	even though I didn't support you that well
2016-05-19 01:01:17	Marty2000	Yes you did
2016-05-19 01:01:40	@PikFan	heh, I did? I got killed more than you did
2016-05-19 01:01:58	Marty2000	I used to play alone and quite offensively with the Splattershot Jr, but I found out it's not the best thing for me
2016-05-19 01:02:18	Marty2000	It's because I avoid battles more, now, so I can keep my Bubbler for teamamates
2016-05-19 01:02:19	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-19 01:02:28	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-19 01:02:43	Marty2000	Of course, I still attack
2016-05-19 01:02:46	Marty2000	But less
2016-05-19 01:05:56	@PikFan	nice match
2016-05-19 01:05:59	Marty2000	Seems we win
2016-05-19 01:06:00	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-19 01:06:05	Marty2000	I got killed often, though
2016-05-19 01:06:09	@PikFan	wait...wha?
2016-05-19 01:06:11	@PikFan	huh?
2016-05-19 01:06:14	Marty2000	We lost :/
2016-05-19 01:06:20	@PikFan	how...?
2016-05-19 01:06:33	@PikFan	that doesn't seem right
2016-05-19 01:06:50	Marty2000	I thought we were going to win because of the squids around the timer... ours were bigger
2016-05-19 01:06:52	@PikFan	because I saw the thing at the top even out at the very last second
2016-05-19 01:07:00	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-19 01:07:12	Marty2000	Maybe because of that Inkstrike
2016-05-19 01:07:15	@PikFan	so they must've somehow inked a lot of turf in that last second
2016-05-19 01:07:22	@PikFan	oh, there was an enemy inkstrike?
2016-05-19 01:10:31	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-19 01:10:36	@PikFan	lol, I tried getting out of there, but you got me anyway
2016-05-19 01:10:40	Marty2000	It landed on me right after the match finished
2016-05-19 01:10:47	@PikFan	...oh
2016-05-19 01:11:08	Marty2000	So I didn' get killed, but it inkied :p
2016-05-19 01:11:14	Marty2000	Maybe that's the reason
2016-05-19 01:11:14	@PikFan	yup
2016-05-19 01:11:20	@PikFan	yeah, probably
2016-05-19 01:15:00	Marty2000	He he, that ending
2016-05-19 01:15:01	@PikFan	sorry
2016-05-19 01:15:07	Marty2000	?
2016-05-19 01:15:09	@PikFan	we killed each other
2016-05-19 01:15:10	Marty2000	Don't worry
2016-05-19 01:15:20	Marty2000	He he, I found it rather funny
2016-05-19 01:15:22	Marty2000	We often tie
2016-05-19 01:15:33	@PikFan	I meant "sorry" as sarcastic
2016-05-19 01:15:40	@PikFan	not an apologetic sorry
2016-05-19 01:15:41	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-19 01:15:43	Marty2000	Sorry :p
2016-05-19 01:15:43	@PikFan	:P
2016-05-19 01:15:48	@PikFan	lol
2016-05-19 01:16:03	Marty2000	By the way, when you killed me with your bomb, I wasn't expecting it
2016-05-19 01:16:10	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-05-19 01:16:12	@PikFan	that was funny
2016-05-19 01:16:16	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-19 01:16:20	@PikFan	and I got that sniper too
2016-05-19 01:16:30	@PikFan	I meant to get him but I didn't think you'd be there, too
2016-05-19 01:19:37	@PikFan	ugh
2016-05-19 01:19:41	@PikFan	too many Echolocators
2016-05-19 01:19:50	Marty2000	Yep!
2016-05-19 01:19:51	@PikFan	but we still won
2016-05-19 01:19:53	@PikFan	awesome
2016-05-19 01:19:56	Marty2000	I use Cold-Blooded, though
2016-05-19 01:20:02	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-19 01:20:03	Marty2000	Even though it was clearly nerfed :/
2016-05-19 01:20:06	Marty2000	Yes, that's good!
2016-05-19 01:24:04	@PikFan	ugh
2016-05-19 01:24:07	Marty2000	Oh yea
2016-05-19 01:24:11	Marty2000	Forgot to tell you
2016-05-19 01:24:12	@PikFan	so I survived that Inkstrike at the enemy base
2016-05-19 01:24:15	Marty2000	When I spam Booyahs
2016-05-19 01:24:27	@PikFan	...then I got killed by a Burst Bomb
2016-05-19 01:24:28	Marty2000	It means I got killed and someone is approaching nearby teammates ;)
2016-05-19 01:24:29	@PikFan	hmm?
2016-05-19 01:24:40	@PikFan	yeah, I've heard of that tactic before
2016-05-19 01:24:43	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-19 01:25:12	Marty2000	Sometimes, when people spam in in Ranked, it's because they're angry :p
2016-05-19 01:25:20	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-19 01:25:43	@PikFan	funny that you call it Booyah, since they say Nice in Europe
2016-05-19 01:28:53	@PikFan	I think you won
2016-05-19 01:28:58	@PikFan	yup, you did
2016-05-19 01:29:00	Marty2000	That was close
2016-05-19 01:29:05	@PikFan	just barely though
2016-05-19 01:29:08	@PikFan	0.2%, wow
2016-05-19 01:29:20	Marty2000	I call it Booyah or Nice depending on who I'm playing with
2016-05-19 01:29:48	Marty2000	I wasn't very good on that match, kept getting killed by everyone
2016-05-19 01:33:13	@PikFan	...yeah, decided to party
2016-05-19 01:33:16	Marty2000	Next timesuch things happen
2016-05-19 01:33:18	Marty2000	I'll party
2016-05-19 01:33:25	Marty2000	For equality
2016-05-19 01:33:35	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-05-19 01:33:37	Marty2000	Sorry for killing whereas you where only 3
2016-05-19 01:33:46	Marty2000	were*
2016-05-19 01:33:52	@PikFan	nah, it's fine
2016-05-19 01:34:10	@PikFan	when that disconnect happened I knew we would lose
2016-05-19 01:34:26	Marty2000	It was unfair :/
2016-05-19 01:37:46	@PikFan	hahahahaha
2016-05-19 01:38:01	@PikFan	got the .96 Gal Deco that was terrorizing us
2016-05-19 01:38:03	Marty2000	I super-jumped to my death :p
2016-05-19 01:38:06	Marty2000	Great!
2016-05-19 01:38:19	@PikFan	he killed me at the beginning of the match while I tried to launch an inkstrike
2016-05-19 01:38:22	@PikFan	the worst part?
2016-05-19 01:38:27	@PikFan	it was near our base
2016-05-19 01:38:34	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-19 01:42:26	Marty2000	lol
2016-05-19 01:42:36	@PikFan	that Diana person was pretty good
2016-05-19 01:42:49	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-19 01:43:02	@PikFan	but the rest of the team... ehh
2016-05-19 01:43:24	Marty2000	She was doing most of the work, I'll say
2016-05-19 01:43:31	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-19 01:47:01	@PikFan	gah
2016-05-19 01:47:04	Marty2000	You win
2016-05-19 01:47:06	@PikFan	I hate Diana now
2016-05-19 01:47:16	@PikFan	I hope they quit
2016-05-19 01:47:27	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-19 01:47:39	@PikFan	I killed everyone on the other team except her
2016-05-19 01:47:43	@PikFan	and who kills me?
2016-05-19 01:47:47	@PikFan	Diana, of course
2016-05-19 01:47:48	@PikFan	:|
2016-05-19 01:47:53	Marty2000	Heh
2016-05-19 01:48:02	@PikFan	oh, good, she's gone
2016-05-19 01:51:19	@PikFan	hmm...
2016-05-19 01:51:21	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-19 01:51:23	@PikFan	I feel like you keep losing...

2016-05-19 01:52:06	Marty2000	So that's because of it :p
2016-05-19 01:52:08	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-19 01:52:39	Marty2000	Well, they were maybe beginners, I didn't see their levels
2016-05-19 01:52:44	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-19 01:56:00	Marty2000	Squid-partied at the very end

2016-05-19 02:14:07	@PikFan	...only to get killed by an inkstrike
2016-05-19 02:14:08	Marty2000	I ddin't even notice

2016-05-19 02:18:24	Marty2000	But the roller joined us

2016-05-19 02:18:28	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-19 02:18:42	@PikFan	the roller on your team didn't care though

2016-05-19 02:19:22	@PikFan	I guess they ignored us because it was 1 person from both teams, so it was still even
2016-05-19 02:19:31	Marty2000	Probably
2016-05-19 02:19:36	@PikFan	and we were out of the way

2016-05-19 11:50:54	Marty2000	It happened to me with Pikmin 2
2016-05-19 11:51:10	Marty2000	If you saved the game
2016-05-19 11:51:18	Marty2000	And use a savestate to get back earlier to that save
2016-05-19 11:51:27	Marty2000	You'll have problems whenever loading or saving
2016-05-19 11:51:32	Marty2000	The game will crash
2016-05-19 11:51:37	Marty2000	Here's what you have to do:
2016-05-19 11:51:44	Marty2000	Load your savestate
2016-05-19 11:51:49	Chiaki_Nanami	Why is Pikmin 2 so weird?
2016-05-19 11:51:55	Marty2000	Make a savestate on that savestate
2016-05-19 11:51:59	Marty2000	And load that savestate again
2016-05-19 11:52:02	Marty2000	Shoudln't crash
2016-05-19 11:52:06	Marty2000	Hi Chiaki_Nanamiu
2016-05-19 11:52:11	Marty2000	Chiaki_Nanami*
2016-05-19 11:52:15	Marty2000	He he, I don't know
2016-05-19 11:52:57	Marty2000	They probably wanted to make a game with so many hidden secrets that you'll still be discovering it in 20 years
2016-05-19 11:53:00	Yoshi2	I also had issues with savestates where if I load the savestate too early, I have no sound
2016-05-19 11:53:31	Marty2000	If you can try what I've explained, tell me if it works ;)
2016-05-19 12:05:16	Yoshi2	oh nooo, some of my audio files play but others don't
2016-05-19 12:06:21	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-19 12:06:35	Marty2000	I fear you'll have to play without using savestates
2016-05-19 12:07:33	Yoshi2	no, this was without savestates
2016-05-19 12:10:40	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-19 12:11:43	Yoshi2	I actually had an audio file not play before, but I thought because it worked 4 or 5 times out of 6, it'd be fine
2016-05-19 12:32:40	Marty2000	Did you try again? So bad some don't work :/
2016-05-19 12:44:59	Yoshi2	I resampled the audio file that didn't play to 24k hz, let's see if that changes anything
2016-05-19 12:45:31	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-19 12:47:55	Yoshi2	stiiiiiill doesn't play, hng
2016-05-19 12:48:58	Marty2000	Hmm... maybe too many songs?
2016-05-19 12:49:02	Marty2000	custom ones*
2016-05-19 12:49:27	Marty2000	It shouldn't be that problem, normzlly, but
2016-05-19 12:49:49	Marty2000	I remember having problems for Sonic Heroes when I made too many changes at once
2016-05-19 12:54:56	Yoshi2	too many custom files is always an option, but it is very random
2016-05-19 12:55:02	Yoshi2	I need to figure out the rule
2016-05-19 13:03:43	Yoshi2	I've now replaced a file that plays earlier with this file
2016-05-19 13:04:35	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-19 13:04:48	Marty2000	Hope it's working...
2016-05-19 13:05:03	Yoshi2	it
2016-05-19 13:05:05	Yoshi2	doesn't
2016-05-19 13:05:09	Yoshi2	what
2016-05-19 13:05:17	Yoshi2	that means the file is somehow at fault
2016-05-19 13:05:28	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-05-19 13:06:52	Yoshi2	SOMEHOW
2016-05-19 13:15:33	Yoshi2	I re-recorded the audio and now it plays
2016-05-19 13:15:35	Yoshi2	whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
2016-05-19 13:15:54	Marty2000	Great!
2016-05-19 13:16:09	Marty2000	Did it stop working...?
2016-05-19 13:22:43	Yoshi2	the whaaat was meant as whaaaaat the hell
2016-05-19 13:22:49	Yoshi2	as in why is it working again
2016-05-19 13:23:07	Marty2000	Ah! Sorry! Misunderstood
2016-05-19 13:23:22	Yoshi2	I have a theory but first I need to try to get all the sounds working again
2016-05-19 13:46:51	Yoshi2	I wanted to be done with this finally so I could get back to my homework :/
2016-05-19 13:47:23	Marty2000	:p
2016-05-19 13:49:13	Yoshi2	ok, here's my theory
2016-05-19 13:49:24	Yoshi2	if the sound file starts off quiet, it won't play
2016-05-19 13:49:43	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-19 13:50:40	Marty2000	That's odd but it can be true, seeing Pikmin 2 and the way the game works

2016-05-19 14:40:07	Marty2000	Great! So it was the cause of your problem... well, if it's working, all the better then
2016-05-19 15:04:24	Yoshi2	ok, I fixed all the audio files according to the rule I found, hopefully it works now
2016-05-19 15:05:31	Marty2000	Okay

2016-05-19 15:14:23	UltraMario	alright
2016-05-19 15:14:28	UltraMario	still have a cold tho
2016-05-19 15:14:39	UltraMario	it's getting a bit better i guess
2016-05-19 15:15:01	Yoshi2	I am glad to hear that you have a cold and I hope you suffer as much from it as possible!
2016-05-19 15:16:24	Marty2000	Hi UltraMario

2016-05-19 15:51:39	Yoshi2	I am not sure why BW does this, but it appears you can't have an audio file be quiet at the start or it won't play
2016-05-19 16:05:55	Marty2000	Strange... maybe hard-coded? (would be even stranger). Anyway, you've solved the problem!
2016-05-19 16:06:42	Yoshi2	well, this behaviour would likely be hard-coded if it is how the audio playing behaves

2016-05-19 16:29:08	@PikFan	hi
2016-05-19 16:29:24	@PikFan	so, I've decided to do something out of the ordinary:
2016-05-19 16:29:40	@PikFan	I'm going to post the incomplete Chapter 6
2016-05-19 16:34:26	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2016-05-19 16:34:32	Yoshi2	incomplete chapter 6 of what?
2016-05-19 16:34:43	@PikFan	of my Pikmin story
2016-05-19 16:35:08	Yoshi2	ah
2016-05-19 16:35:14	@PikFan	I want more people to be interested in it, but...
2016-05-19 16:35:39	@PikFan	people don't seem very fond of fanfiction within the Pikmin community
2016-05-19 16:36:11	@PikFan	there's been some people who are interested, yes
2016-05-19 16:36:30	@PikFan	but it's mainly the younger users + Scruffy
2016-05-19 16:37:11	@PikFan	anyway, I don't mean to bore you with my sob stories, how are things going on your end?
2016-05-19 16:38:29	Marty2000	Hi PikFan
2016-05-19 16:38:41	@PikFan	hi
2016-05-19 16:40:19	Yoshi2	I'm in the final phase of finishing a demonstration video for audio modding in battalion wars
2016-05-19 16:40:32	@PikFan	ah, nice
2016-05-19 16:40:43	@PikFan	hope things go smoothly
2016-05-19 16:41:03	Yoshi2	because what better way is there to demonstrate audio modding than by having me talking about audio modding throug the modded audio files? :P
2016-05-19 16:41:17	Yoshi2	*through
2016-05-19 16:41:25	@PikFan	lol
2016-05-19 17:06:49	Yoshi2	ahh, some time values were off, need to adjust them and try again
2016-05-19 17:30:02	Yoshi2	now if dolphin could stop being stupid
2016-05-19 17:30:15	Yoshi2	because for some reason the audio playback is really sped up
2016-05-19 17:30:25	@PikFan	fun
2016-05-19 17:30:48	Yoshi2	but only in dolphin on linux
2016-05-19 17:32:13	Yoshi2	ok, this time it isn't sped up
2016-05-19 17:32:23	@PikFan	do you know what caused it?
2016-05-19 17:32:27	Yoshi2	no idea
2016-05-19 17:32:44	Yoshi2	it never happened before

2016-05-19 18:10:41	Yoshi2	so far so good, time to encode the video
2016-05-19 18:11:23	Yoshi2	only regret I have is that I should've made some of my voice lines louder, but I don't want to go back and amplify them again
2016-05-19 18:19:53	Marty2000	Oh, cool
2016-05-19 18:26:44	Yoshi2	you can still hear what I'm saying fairly clearly, but it is easily noticable how some of my voice lines are more silent than other sounds/lines
2016-05-19 18:35:28	Marty2000	I don't think it'll be a problem
2016-05-19 18:35:32	Marty2000	I'll tell you

2016-05-19 19:36:25	@Espyo	when it changes to the old voice clips, it's easy to tell that your recordings are pretty quiet

2016-05-19 19:54:13	@Espyo	but for galvanizer, it makes sense, since it's like "a thing that galvanizes"
2016-05-19 19:54:19	@Espyo	for counter, "a thing that counters" IS a counter
2016-05-19 19:54:38	@Espyo	like rock is the counter to scissors, scissors is the counter to paper
2016-05-19 19:54:54	@Espyo	it's used both as a verb and a noun

2016-05-19 20:00:19	Marty2000	Well, that's more complicated than that

2016-05-19 20:00:33	Marty2000	It's botha mistake and not one
2016-05-19 20:00:37	@Espyo	hmmmm...
2016-05-19 20:04:25	Marty2000	So
2016-05-19 20:04:50	Marty2000	You need that "é", it's mandatory on these words
2016-05-19 20:05:02	Marty2000	(see the American version, they put them)
2016-05-19 20:05:04	Marty2000	But
2016-05-19 20:05:50	Marty2000	We usually do not put accents on capital letters in France. I don't exactly know why, and so do other people, but

2016-05-19 20:35:01	@Espyo	I did think about it a bit
2016-05-19 20:35:13	@Espyo	maybe it's some volume equalizer algorithm?

2016-05-19 20:35:29	@Espyo	and if they're 0, the average is 0, so

2016-05-19 22:04:03	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-19 22:22:14	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=100_Pikmin_limit&curid=19481&diff=164739&oldid=161280 P2 only, right?
2016-05-19 22:22:36	Marty2000	Good question, I haven't verified for P1 and P3
2016-05-19 22:22:45	Marty2000	But only for P2 right now, yeah
2016-05-19 22:29:47	Testyo	between me wait
2016-05-19 22:31:26	Yoshi2	ow, this info graphic took me a bit of time: http://i.imgur.com/nSyPbvt.png
2016-05-19 22:31:33	Yoshi2	but I think it came out decently
2016-05-19 22:32:44	Marty2000	Nice
2016-05-19 22:33:09	@Espyo	I hate little endian
2016-05-19 22:33:21	@Espyo	not only does its name make it so hard for me to not say "little indian"
2016-05-19 22:33:23	@Espyo	and then sing the song
2016-05-19 22:33:30	@Espyo	but it's just nonsense
2016-05-19 22:33:40	@Espyo	I never really did understand why some bytes are organized like that
2016-05-19 22:43:00	Marty2000	I tried motion controls for several matches... it's just a catastrophe, I can't use them correctly, so I guess it's definitely not for me. Well, I'll try again
2016-05-19 22:43:07	Marty2000	Maybe I'll finally get used to them
2016-05-19 22:43:52	@Espyo	it takes getting used to, definitely
2016-05-19 22:44:00	@Espyo	especially if you didn't already start with them
2016-05-19 22:44:11	Marty2000	I didn't, indeed
2016-05-19 22:44:13	@Espyo	I knew they'd be superior to the analog controls from the start
2016-05-19 22:44:30	@Espyo	because I can turn at any speed instead of being limited
2016-05-19 22:44:30	@Espyo	so I tried to learn them first thing
2016-05-19 22:44:43	Marty2000	The only drawback with sticks is that you can't instantly ttack foes behind you
2016-05-19 22:44:57	Marty2000	Plus I use -3, so turning is slow for me
2016-05-19 22:45:04	Marty2000	You were right doing so
2016-05-19 22:46:08	@Espyo	actually, you acn
2016-05-19 22:46:09	@Espyo	*can
2016-05-19 22:46:13	@Espyo	hold back and press Y

2016-05-19 22:48:43	Marty2000	I see, thanks. I'll try a charger, maybe it'll be better...

2016-05-19 22:56:35	Marty2000	Hmm, I want a challenge. I want to try a new weapon. Anybody here, choose the weapon I should try. I'll play with it for a match, and post on Youtube. Thanks
2016-05-19 22:57:28	@Espyo	Nozzlenose
2016-05-19 22:57:40	Marty2000	Okay, which one?
2016-05-19 22:57:57	@Espyo	oh, there are different ones
2016-05-19 22:57:57	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-19 22:58:01	@Espyo	well, if you didn't try the classic, go for it
2016-05-19 22:58:23	Marty2000	I have tried all weapons, but I'm not used to playing with it, so let's go
2016-05-19 22:58:49	Marty2000	The regular one has Disruptors and a Killer Wail
2016-05-19 22:59:24	Marty2000	The custom version has Burst Bombs and a Kraken
2016-05-19 22:59:46	Marty2000	The H version has a Point Sensor and Inkzooka
2016-05-19 23:00:04	Marty2000	The custom version has a Suction Bomb and an Echocolocator
2016-05-19 23:00:48	Marty2000	Well, I'll play with the regular one
2016-05-19 23:05:15	Marty2000	That was horrible
2016-05-19 23:05:24	Marty2000	I'll do a second match too
2016-05-19 23:05:30	Marty2000	It's a good weapon
2016-05-19 23:05:37	Marty2000	But horrible against chargers for me
2016-05-19 23:06:10	@Espyo	hah
2016-05-19 23:09:22	Marty2000	Lol
2016-05-19 23:09:28	Marty2000	Worse than the first match
2016-05-19 23:09:33	Marty2000	I didn't kill anybody
2016-05-19 23:09:39	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-19 23:09:47	Marty2000	888p and 851p
2016-05-19 23:09:58	@Espyo	well, not THAT bad
2016-05-19 23:11:29	Marty2000	Hmm, okay, upload finished in 130 minutes, se we've got time... Now, I have to try another on,e
2016-05-19 23:11:31	Marty2000	one*
2016-05-19 23:12:06	Marty2000	The big problem with the weapon is that you cannot keep up a sustained barrage
2016-05-19 23:12:15	Marty2000	Pressing each time takes time, actually
2016-05-19 23:12:28	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-19 23:12:48	Marty2000	Yoshi2
2016-05-19 23:13:00	Marty2000	Tell me what weapon to choose
2016-05-19 23:13:01	Yoshi2	Marty2000
2016-05-19 23:13:15	Yoshi2	bucket
2016-05-19 23:13:40	Marty2000	WHich one? Not the regular Tri-Slosher, though, I use it too much
2016-05-19 23:14:04	@Espyo	Tri-Slosher is best
2016-05-19 23:14:12	Yoshi2	last time I used the bucket, there was only one type
2016-05-19 23:14:18	Yoshi2	so idk ¯\(ツ)/¯  
2016-05-19 23:14:31	Marty2000	I'll take the one you tested, then
2016-05-19 23:14:41	Marty2000	With Burst Bombs and Inkstrike?
2016-05-19 23:16:17	Marty2000	Okay, starting
2016-05-19 23:20:32	Marty2000	Good match: the only Inkling that killed me was a charger, and it was behnd walls. Second match :)

2016-05-20 16:33:15	@PikFan	of all the people...
2016-05-20 16:33:47	@PikFan	I wanted someone who's a writer on fanfiction.net to review my story
2016-05-20 16:33:54	@PikFan	not a little kid like LoganPikmin

2016-05-20 16:38:25	Yoshi2	I know a kid who comments on some of my BW modding stuff and his feedback has been pretty worthless so far
2016-05-20 16:39:25	@PikFan	well, do you get feedback from anyone else?

2016-05-20 16:40:49	@PikFan	I was hoping to get a review from one of the other authors, NOT LoganPikmin
2016-05-20 16:41:19	@PikFan	it's funny, there was a Splatoon fic that I started reading, and it had just updated
2016-05-20 16:41:44	@PikFan	and in the most recent chapter, the author was venting in his author's notes like I am now
2016-05-20 16:42:00	@PikFan	...so I posted a very long and analytical review
2016-05-20 16:42:19	@PikFan	it motivated him to keep updating, luckily

2016-05-20 20:44:18	Cheepy-Cheepy	What's he say about your story
2016-05-20 20:44:26	@PikFan	he basically said "oh I like your story it's good don't stop it"

2016-05-20 20:45:20	@PikFan	little kids just say everything is good or bad
2016-05-20 20:45:29	Cheepy-Cheepy	Well... at least I'm not the only one who isn't too fond of him.

2016-05-20 20:46:20	@PikFan	because I KNOW there are authors on there who will review

2016-05-20 20:46:45	Cheepy-Cheepy	Not too long ago
2016-05-20 20:46:46	@PikFan	oh, what makes me even more upset is the fact that a new story—like 3 days old—got 2 reviews

2016-05-20 23:34:22	Marty2000	Not grammar
2016-05-20 23:34:24	Marty2000	Is it?
2016-05-20 23:38:13	Marty2000	Well, anyway, I couldn't lauch P1, so I couldn't verify, Espyo
2016-05-20 23:38:17	Marty2000	Only for P3
2016-05-20 23:38:33	Marty2000	And a Swooping Snitchbug can bury 100 Pikmin in this game

2016-05-21 11:59:31	Testyo	I find English pronunciation easy
2016-05-21 12:04:52	@Espyo	hi

2016-05-21 13:19:14	Marty2000	2 questions, Espyo. I'm going to make a new save... in the American Gamecube version of P2 (for these treasures http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty#Reminder). Do you want me to try something in particular since I'm restarting the game? And also, for  
2016-05-21 13:19:21	Marty2000	these images 
2016-05-21 13:19:23	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/f/ff/-94Omega_Flywheel.png
2016-05-21 13:19:35	Marty2000	I guess we need lighter images, right?
2016-05-21 13:34:31	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-21 13:34:37	@Espyo	no, I don't think anything special is needed
2016-05-21 13:34:43	@Espyo	yeah, lighter
2016-05-21 13:34:51	@Espyo	basically, the point of the image is for the reader to... well, see the treasure
2016-05-21 13:34:58	@Espyo	if it's so blurry and dark that you can't make anything out
2016-05-21 13:35:00	@Espyo	then it's pretty pointless
2016-05-21 13:35:48	Marty2000	That's pretty much what I thought (+ we need more images of the treasure itself, anyway).
2016-05-21 13:35:56	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-21 13:46:56	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlL-qFt7w hm, we gotta pay attention to this
2016-05-21 13:51:06	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-05-21 13:51:23	Marty2000	That might be REALLY interesting

2016-05-21 13:52:25	Marty2000	Hmm... maybe useless, now that I think of it
2016-05-21 13:52:34	@Espyo	maybe
2016-05-21 13:52:52	@Espyo	if it's some way to make leaders go super far, you can probably use it to go really far out of bounds and take a lot of shortcuts
2016-05-21 13:53:00	@Espyo	but if it's just a way to go out of bounds on that section..
2016-05-21 13:53:01	Marty2000	Because when you load a new area, if you were out of bounds, you're no longer out of bounds
2016-05-21 13:53:01	@Espyo	*...
2016-05-21 13:53:04	@Espyo	well, then it's still fun
2016-05-21 13:53:08	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-21 13:53:10	@Espyo	look at how much of the radar's blackness he uncovreed

2016-05-21 15:33:21	@Espyo	you can have 100 seeds in P1
2016-05-21 15:33:24	@Espyo	at least with the Mamuta
2016-05-21 15:33:30	@Espyo	worth a check with the Snitchbug
2016-05-21 15:38:20	@Espyo	this...isn't gonna work
2016-05-21 15:38:25	@Espyo	the Snitchbug in P1 is too stupid
2016-05-21 15:38:37	@Espyo	it grabs a Pikmin or two, and then flies all the way across the map before throwing one
2016-05-21 15:38:49	@Espyo	so I can't just stay in place and wait for me to lose all Pikmin
2016-05-21 15:38:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-21 15:38:59	@Espyo	I could chase him... but there's not enough time
2016-05-21 15:39:08	@Espyo	still have 90 Pikmin with me, and the day is 1/3 done
2016-05-21 15:39:12	@Espyo	it's safe to assume it works
2016-05-21 15:39:15	Marty2000	It's okay, checking with the Mamuta is enough, I guess
2016-05-21 15:39:19	@Espyo	I mean, the game has no real reason to stop 100 seeds
2016-05-21 15:39:24	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-21 15:39:38	@Espyo	ok, so... it's a P2 thing only
2016-05-21 15:39:40	@Espyo	that blocking thing
2016-05-21 15:39:41	@Espyo	really weird
2016-05-21 15:39:44	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-21 15:39:56	@Espyo	I'm trying to think why
2016-05-21 15:39:59	@Espyo	but I really can't figure it out
2016-05-21 15:41:11	Marty2000	It could also be a NPC thing only... or maybe it was made to help the player beat the Swooping Snitchbug in case all Pikmin were buried (but it's stupid, because you can pluck them)
2016-05-21 15:41:27	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-21 15:41:33	@Espyo	plus, it's also a thing with Mamutas
2016-05-21 15:41:35	@Espyo	I'll check GC P2
2016-05-21 15:42:31	--	sleepi is now known as AFKazooie
2016-05-21 15:43:18	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-21 15:43:27	@Espyo	the Snitchbug in P1 only throws one Pikmin at a time
2016-05-21 15:43:29	@Espyo	even if it grabs two
2016-05-21 15:43:37	@Espyo	the one in P2 will toss both to the ground at the same time
2016-05-21 15:43:42	@Espyo	we need to check P3
2016-05-21 15:43:52	@Espyo	but I'll add this to the [[Swooping Snitchbug]] article anyway

2016-05-21 15:44:25	Marty2000	I checked P3 yesterday
2016-05-21 15:44:31	Marty2000	Maybe you didn't see my message
2016-05-21 15:44:37	Marty2000	You can have 100 seeds
2016-05-21 15:46:02	@Espyo	oh, no no
2016-05-21 15:46:09	@Espyo	I mean the "throwing both at once or throwing one at a time" thing
2016-05-21 15:46:28	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-21 15:46:46	Marty2000	The Swooping Snitchbug throws 2 Pikmin at once in P3 too
2016-05-21 15:49:02	@Espyo	all right, cool
2016-05-21 15:49:15	@Espyo	also, it can't turn the 100th one into a seed in GC P2
2016-05-21 15:49:21	@Espyo	so it's not just a Wii thing
2016-05-21 15:50:00	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-21 15:50:11	@Espyo	anyway, I don't think this info should be on the 100 Pikmin limit article
2016-05-21 15:50:22	@Espyo	that article is about the mechanic that stops 101 or more Pikmin from being in the same place at once
2016-05-21 15:50:28	@Espyo	I think it makes more sense to put it in a "seed" article
2016-05-21 15:50:36	@Espyo	but since we don't have that, we'll use the Pikmin family article
2016-05-21 15:50:42	@Espyo	I'm starting to think we can create a seed article
2016-05-21 15:50:47	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-21 15:50:49	@Espyo	there's enough to say about it that warrants an article, imo
2016-05-21 15:50:58	@Espyo	I'll try to make a list of stuff that can be said
2016-05-21 15:51:17	Marty2000	I'd have a trivia thing

2016-05-21 15:56:52	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-21 15:59:06	@Espyo	do you have the Mamuta 99 seeds video lying around?
2016-05-21 15:59:11	@Espyo	well, a link to it
2016-05-21 16:01:06	Marty2000	Wait, I'll link you to it

2016-05-21 16:02:07	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-21 16:02:23	Marty2000	I didn't know what it was back then, so I thought it was a glitch
2016-05-21 16:03:03	@Espyo	hehe, yeah
2016-05-21 16:04:12	@Espyo	hm, if we do make an article on seed
2016-05-21 16:04:21	@Espyo	it's important that we distinguish between a seed and a buried Pikmin
2016-05-21 16:04:31	@Espyo	a seed is ONLY the little thing that flies from the Onion and goes to the gruond
2016-05-21 16:04:32	@Espyo	*ground
2016-05-21 16:04:41	@Espyo	after it enters the ground, it becomes a full Pikmin, that is merely plucked
2016-05-21 16:05:08	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-21 16:07:04	@Espyo	hm, can we Romanize Russian?
2016-05-21 16:07:21	Marty2000	Yes we can

2016-05-21 16:09:06	@Espyo	what about Arabic?
2016-05-21 16:09:16	@Espyo	there's support on the template for it, but it's not on the template's documentation
2016-05-21 16:09:51	Marty2000	I think we can romanize Arabic
2016-05-21 16:10:02	@Espyo	I think so too

2016-05-21 16:10:52	@Espyo	not quite sure why we have it

2016-05-21 16:12:21	Marty2000	I see

2016-05-21 16:16:22	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cupid's_Grenade#Names_in_other_languages looks good
2016-05-21 16:17:19	Marty2000	Nice
2016-05-21 16:17:36	@Espyo	ok, so
2016-05-21 16:17:38	@Espyo	what you're saying is
2016-05-21 16:17:44	@Espyo	the "Plain Lid" IS the "Pig Father"
2016-05-21 16:17:46	@Espyo	is that it?
2016-05-21 16:17:50	Marty2000	Yes, it IS
2016-05-21 16:17:56	@Espyo	I swear, I am SO distant from the entire mess that is the treasures...
2016-05-21 16:18:02	@Espyo	all right, all clear for a merge
2016-05-21 16:18:14	@Espyo	seems like Plain Lid was created at wikia
2016-05-21 16:18:17	@Espyo	Pig Father was created here
2016-05-21 16:18:20	@Espyo	and we just have the two
2016-05-21 16:18:22	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-21 16:18:24	@Espyo	even though it's the exact same treasure
2016-05-21 16:18:33	Marty2000	Merging them is better
2016-05-21 16:19:12	Marty2000	However, why do they have different names? I can't really understand why... is it a translation, or was the name taken from the Early English script?

2016-05-21 16:19:56	@Espyo	wikia's names might be from the old script
2016-05-21 16:20:08	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-21 16:20:33	@Espyo	although "Plain Lid" is not on the early English script
2016-05-21 16:20:46	Marty2000	I might verify if we have English names for those treasures with my code. I know I could see "Love and Courage Reactor" in the Treasure Hoard, oncz
2016-05-21 16:20:49	Marty2000	once*
2016-05-21 16:20:51	Marty2000	I'll verify later
2016-05-21 16:21:22	@Espyo	right, right
2016-05-21 16:21:32	@Espyo	really? I remember translating Love and Courage Reactor
2016-05-21 16:21:39	@Espyo	didn't know it was made a "canon" name at one point
2016-05-21 16:21:52	Marty2000	It's also the name of the treasure in the early English script
2016-05-21 16:21:58	@Espyo	right
2016-05-21 16:21:59	Marty2000	I have a screenshot of that, maybe

2016-05-21 17:02:00	Marty2000	Basically, what the [[Plain Lid]] article says is fake

2016-05-21 17:04:39	Marty2000	Meaning a merge is nearly useless (only for the Gmaecube section, since it details a little how to get it)
2016-05-21 17:05:00	Marty2000	Not even the price changes
2016-05-21 17:06:40	@Espyo	right
2016-05-21 17:06:45	@Espyo	in that case, can you fix up the Pig Father article
2016-05-21 17:06:51	@Espyo	and I'll delete the Plain Lid article entirely
2016-05-21 17:07:22	Marty2000	Okay, but before, I have to see if I can find its English name
2016-05-21 17:08:29	Marty2000	I think it will take little time (15-20 minutes)
2016-05-21 17:11:30	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Cupid's_Grenade#Notes ugh, this is as best as you can get, I think

2016-05-21 17:29:17	Marty2000	Okay, I have just retrieveed the treasure, I'll check in the Treasure Hoard
2016-05-21 17:29:56	@Espyo	so you don't get its early English name on the retrieval cutscene?
2016-05-21 17:30:13	Marty2000	There's no name for it in the Treasure Hoard...
2016-05-21 17:30:18	Marty2000	It depends on the treasure
2016-05-21 17:30:27	Marty2000	Wait, I'll show with screenshots

2016-05-21 17:41:44	Marty2000	And "camouflage" is written "camoflouge"
2016-05-21 17:42:02	Marty2000	Maybe it was meant to be the final boss again
2016-05-21 17:42:02	@Espyo	hah
2016-05-21 17:42:03	@Espyo	didn't notice
2016-05-21 17:42:08	@Espyo	maybe
2016-05-21 17:50:07	@Espyo	ok, since it has no name
2016-05-21 17:50:15	@Espyo	can you change the Pig Father article with the most up-to-date information?
2016-05-21 17:50:19	@Espyo	I'll delete Plain Lid afterwards
2016-05-21 17:50:35	@Espyo	and this also got me thinking — that means the name "Plain Lid" is completely made up

2016-05-21 17:52:02	Marty2000	That's just what I need to merge, right?

2016-05-21 18:04:22	Marty2000	Okay, thanks.
2016-05-21 18:04:46	Marty2000	Hmm... "Pig Father" was obtained using Google Translation..
2016-05-21 18:04:57	Marty2000	I used another translator
2016-05-21 18:05:02	Marty2000	And they call the treasure
2016-05-21 18:05:07	Marty2000	"Ground cover"
2016-05-21 18:06:55	Marty2000	There's also Milk Pig...
2016-05-21 18:07:00	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-21 18:07:08	@Espyo	well, the name is Chi Chi Buta
2016-05-21 18:07:10	@Espyo	Buta is clearly pig
2016-05-21 18:07:15	@Espyo	it can't really be anything else...
2016-05-21 18:07:19	@Espyo	wait
2016-05-21 18:07:21	Marty2000	Chichi seems to be "fussy"
2016-05-21 18:07:21	@Espyo	maybe it is
2016-05-21 18:07:30	@Espyo	google translate said that that means father
2016-05-21 18:07:39	@Espyo	[[Armored Cannon Larva]] — I think buta is used here

2016-05-21 18:07:41	@Espyo	or is it futa...
2016-05-21 18:07:45	Marty2000	Futa
2016-05-21 18:07:51	@Espyo	it's futa
2016-05-21 18:07:52	@Espyo	right
2016-05-21 18:07:56	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-21 18:08:05	@Espyo	this is a bit of a problem
2016-05-21 18:08:15	@Espyo	getting a translation for a Japanese enemy name isn't so hard
2016-05-21 18:08:24	@Espyo	because the names normally reflect what the creature is
2016-05-21 18:08:33	@Espyo	but for treasures? most treasure names mean nonsense
2016-05-21 18:08:46	@Espyo	so honestly any one of the possible translations is valid
2016-05-21 18:09:01	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-21 18:09:57	@Espyo	though if buta can mean cover, I'd more likely bet that's what it is
2016-05-21 18:10:00	@Espyo	since it is a cover
2016-05-21 18:10:04	@Espyo	doesn't make much sense for it to be pig
2016-05-21 18:10:07	@Espyo	unless we can find more context
2016-05-21 18:10:12	@Espyo	like on the journal or sales pitch
2016-05-21 18:10:28	@Espyo	Thought and thought, at the end, which was thought to thought, it was concluded that it is just a cover object. In fact, unknown value is ...? Room for swelling of the imagination is endless!
2016-05-21 18:10:30	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-21 18:10:54	Marty2000	"Too often, academic ideas into a cul-de-sac. May actually just a lid. …………. …………. It is indeed ... would not be ..."
2016-05-21 18:11:04	@Espyo	if I had to guess from the top of my head, looks like the sales pitch is just saying "You can try and try to think about what this is. Although in reality, it's just a cover, the possibilities are only limited by your imagination!"
2016-05-21 18:11:04	Marty2000	Hmm...

2016-05-21 18:11:14	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-21 18:11:19	@Espyo	seems like pig doesn't have anything to do with it
2016-05-21 18:11:21	Marty2000	They say something similar
2016-05-21 18:11:23	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-21 18:11:26	@Espyo	the keyword here is definitely "lid", or "cover"

2016-05-21 18:11:55	@Espyo	not really...

2016-05-21 18:12:44	@Espyo	milk or father
2016-05-21 18:12:58	@Espyo	weird
2016-05-21 18:13:07	@Espyo	jisho refuses to acknowledge that as meaning "cover" whatsoever
2016-05-21 18:13:10	@Espyo	it insists that it's pig-related
2016-05-21 18:13:25	@Espyo	normally it's pretty good at...well, NOT being so unculture
2016-05-21 18:13:27	@Espyo	*d
2016-05-21 18:13:33	@Espyo	google translate agrees
2016-05-21 18:13:39	@Espyo	but it's likely cover...
2016-05-21 18:13:45	@Espyo	especially when you consider what the notes say
2016-05-21 18:13:51	@Espyo	as for chichi...
2016-05-21 18:13:51	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-21 18:13:55	@Espyo	well, like I said, jisho.org says milk
2016-05-21 18:14:19	Marty2000	But chichi is milk for something else in Japanese...
2016-05-21 18:14:27	@Espyo	hm?
2016-05-21 18:15:09	@Espyo	oh, wordreference.com also agrees 乳 (chichi) is milk
2016-05-21 18:15:10	Marty2000	Well, I think I'll have to ask my Japanese friend, but she might not respond now
2016-05-21 18:15:19	Marty2000	Wordreference is the best, according to me
2016-05-21 18:15:22	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-21 18:15:28	@Espyo	well, jisho is the best, according to me :P
2016-05-21 18:15:33	Marty2000	:p
2016-05-21 18:15:45	@Espyo	nah, but it seems pretty clear that it's probably "milk cover"
2016-05-21 18:16:03	@Espyo	yeah, even google translate agrees it's milk
2016-05-21 18:16:10	Marty2000	I'll ask her, now
2016-05-21 18:16:13	@Espyo	but only for 乳, not for ちち
2016-05-21 18:16:14	Marty2000	Maybe she'll respond
2016-05-21 18:16:15	@Espyo	all right

2016-05-21 19:54:22	Marty2000	I did
2016-05-21 19:54:23	@Espyo	it has this and a lot more
2016-05-21 19:54:25	Marty2000	But I didn't see the icons
2016-05-21 19:54:28	@Espyo	did you read the subpages too?
2016-05-21 19:54:31	@Espyo	you might've missed those
2016-05-21 19:54:34	Marty2000	Maybe not all of them
2016-05-21 19:54:42	@Espyo	that might be it
2016-05-21 19:54:46	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-05-21 19:54:51	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-21 19:54:53	@Espyo	they're fun reads
2016-05-21 19:55:31	Yoshi2	I love the part where pikmin 2 has a freaking turret of a WW2-era tank
2016-05-21 19:59:46	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-05-21 19:59:49	@Espyo	you really do

2016-05-21 20:06:22	Yoshi2	PikFan: I read through the prologue of your story yesterday and I already think there is some room for improvement, but I need to read the rest of the story first before I can give my judgement
2016-05-21 20:06:43	@PikFan	hah
2016-05-21 20:06:55	@PikFan	yeah, prologues can always be strange

2016-05-21 20:19:13	Yoshi2	WHO THE FUCK
2016-05-21 20:19:13	Testyo	You must be really upset if you're swearing. What can I do to help?
2016-05-21 20:19:17	Yoshi2	CHANGED THAT
2016-05-21 20:19:23	@Espyo	wtf
2016-05-21 20:19:24	Yoshi2	it is a Panther tank
2016-05-21 20:19:26	@Espyo	I don't remember it being changed
2016-05-21 20:19:29	@Espyo	and I'm following the changes
2016-05-21 20:19:34	@Espyo	every day I check the recent changes
2016-05-21 20:19:46	@Espyo	let's check the history
2016-05-21 20:20:03	Yoshi2	I wonder if I messed up
2016-05-21 20:20:21	@PikFan	Metalmallow
2016-05-21 20:20:28	@PikFan	changed it back in April
2016-05-21 20:20:54	@Espyo	with no explanation, too
2016-05-21 20:20:58	@Espyo	https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Pikmin_2/Unused_%26_Early_Treasures&diff=prev&oldid=281212
2016-05-21 20:21:07	@Espyo	well, revert it, and explain on the summary that he's wrong
2016-05-21 20:21:48	Yoshi2	do I press "Undo" or do I make a new change reverting that change?
2016-05-21 20:22:10	@Espyo	probably the latter
2016-05-21 20:22:15	@Espyo	since there's been another change in the meantime
2016-05-21 20:22:28	@Espyo	though it honestly might work if you do undo
2016-05-21 20:22:37	@Espyo	but maybe you shouldn't, otherwise the mods might see it as an undo war
2016-05-21 20:22:47	@Espyo	so, just a normal edit will do
2016-05-21 20:25:31	@PikFan	wow, one of my teammates disconnected, but all three of us were really good
2016-05-21 20:25:38	@PikFan	we won the match
2016-05-21 20:26:02	@PikFan	I love winning 3 on 4 matches
2016-05-21 20:26:10	@Espyo	nice
2016-05-21 20:26:40	@PikFan	...gah
2016-05-21 20:26:52	@PikFan	I really wish there was a notification system...
2016-05-21 20:27:10	@PikFan	I hate joining a friend only to see that they're gone :|
2016-05-21 20:27:40	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-21 20:28:29	Yoshi2	Espyo: how's this for a summary: "Panther" is the name of an actual tank Germany used in WW2, compare here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_tank
2016-05-21 20:28:50	@Espyo	seems perfect to me
2016-05-21 20:29:08	@Espyo	though I have to ask: why is "Panzer" wrong?
2016-05-21 20:29:12	@Espyo	I have 0 knowledge on the subject
2016-05-21 20:29:20	Yoshi2	Panzer literally means tank
2016-05-21 20:29:43	Yoshi2	well, the armored vehicle on tracks with a gun kind of tank
2016-05-21 20:29:45	Yoshi2	not water tank
2016-05-21 20:30:20	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-05-21 20:31:23	Yoshi2	and there would be no point in putting that in quotes

2016-05-21 20:50:48	@PikFan	Espyo, Marty2000: do you guys want to try to climb the totem pole in Camp Triggerfish at some point?
2016-05-21 20:51:01	@Espyo	that sounds weird
2016-05-21 20:51:36	Yoshi2	that triggers me
2016-05-21 20:51:37	Marty2000	Why not
2016-05-21 20:51:47	@Espyo	take it to the talk page
2016-05-21 20:52:15	@PikFan	nice word choice Yoshi2
2016-05-21 20:53:25	@Espyo	<eientei|sleep> Espyo: The real question is: What Panzer. Apparently only the Mark V is "Panther" while the rest are Panzers
2016-05-21 20:55:36	Yoshi2	Espyo: should i make a history lesson in the talk page
2016-05-21 20:55:43	@Espyo	heh, if you want
2016-05-21 20:55:50	Yoshi2	i could but it would literally be a waste of time
2016-05-21 20:55:59	@Espyo	I think so too
2016-05-21 20:56:08	@Espyo	if you can't find something quick and simple to let him know why that's wrong, don't bother
2016-05-21 20:56:26	@Espyo	plus, some TCRF admins are notoriously pissy
2016-05-21 20:56:34	@Espyo	not sure if it's the case with einstein, but still
2016-05-21 20:56:44	@Espyo	they can't take much disagreement before going ban-happy
2016-05-21 20:57:48	Yoshi2	the quick rundown of this is that a number of German tanks/vehicles during WW2 had official animal-themed, or cat-themed nicknames
2016-05-21 20:58:14	Yoshi2	the Panzerkampfwagen V (or mark V, as he called it, I guess) is Panther
2016-05-21 20:58:30	Yoshi2	Panzerkampfwagen VI is Tiger
2016-05-21 20:59:02	Yoshi2	a variant of the panther with a fixed casemate instead of a turret was a Jagdpanther, a similar variant of the tiger was Jagdtiger
2016-05-21 20:59:17	Yoshi2	there was a REALLY heavy (180 tons heavy) tank called Maus
2016-05-21 21:00:09	@Espyo	named after the mouse?
2016-05-21 21:00:18	Yoshi2	mouse, yes
2016-05-21 21:00:23	Marty2000	https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/r92j/story/index21.html
2016-05-21 21:00:25	Marty2000	Lok
2016-05-21 21:00:27	@Espyo	truly the heaviest of animals
2016-05-21 21:00:27	Marty2000	Look*
2016-05-21 21:00:39	Yoshi2	I think the name was chosen to mislead people
2016-05-21 21:00:54	@Espyo	hehe, I figured that'd be it
2016-05-21 21:00:56	Marty2000	Maybe we'll find the missing artworks
2016-05-21 21:01:01	@Espyo	maybe, Marty
2016-05-21 21:01:04	@Espyo	that seems like a good resource
2016-05-21 21:01:28	@Espyo	crap, the images are baked into the yellowish background frame with the name
2016-05-21 21:01:52	Yoshi2	zzzzzzz Panther was reverted to Panzer
2016-05-21 21:02:10	Yoshi2	i am NOT taking this
2016-05-21 21:02:23	@Espyo	oh, I thought I mentioned
2016-05-21 21:02:31	@Espyo	but either way, do take it to the talk page, and see how it goes from there
2016-05-21 21:02:39	@Espyo	regardless of who's right, no wiki benefits from undo-wars
2016-05-21 21:03:18	Yoshi2	yep, I'd definitely take it to the wiki
2016-05-21 21:04:12	Yoshi2	maybe I should even make a better comparison of the ingame model to a real image
2016-05-21 21:08:33	Yoshi2	but I'm still pretty pissed because this is such a waste of time, and anybody with half a brain could check the wiki page and see the similarities :/
2016-05-21 21:09:07	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-21 21:09:08	@Espyo	such is life
2016-05-21 21:09:28	Yoshi2	the way it is currently is like if there was an image of the super cool modern tank the USA uses called the M1 Abrams
2016-05-21 21:09:33	Yoshi2	and there was a caption saying
2016-05-21 21:09:50	Yoshi2	the American "Tank" tank
2016-05-21 21:09:58	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-21 21:14:35	Yoshi2	me right now: https://xkcd.com/386/
2016-05-21 21:21:39	Yoshi2	Espyo: in the next few days I will start writing some text for the talk page and I hope you can help me find words that will get the tcrf people the least mad
2016-05-21 21:22:04	Yoshi2	:I
2016-05-21 21:22:08	@PikFan	I like your determination
2016-05-21 21:25:10	Yoshi2	absolutely nobody cared about my initial change until some random guy came along and changed it to the current one without an explanation and now we're stuck with this D:
2016-05-21 21:26:18	Marty2000	Looks like they didn't care about that "random guy"'s edit either
2016-05-21 21:26:31	@PikFan	rip
2016-05-21 21:26:33	Marty2000	But sadly, they had to care about yours
2016-05-21 21:27:03	Yoshi2	ok, how do I rotate a model in bmdview2
2016-05-21 21:27:18	Yoshi2	I need to make a better screenshot of this tank turret model
2016-05-21 21:29:17	Marty2000	Not sure, but try around the letters around J
2016-05-21 21:29:25	Marty2000	You might find out
2016-05-21 21:30:10	Yoshi2	IJKL seem to do it but eh, these controls suck
2016-05-21 21:30:17	Yoshi2	it swings the camera
2016-05-21 21:30:37	@Espyo	you have to go around
2016-05-21 21:30:44	@Espyo	with the mouse (or arrow keys)
2016-05-21 21:30:51	@Espyo	walk manually to where you want the camera
2016-05-21 21:30:53	@Espyo	and then face the model again
2016-05-21 21:31:02	Yoshi2	that's what I feared
2016-05-21 21:31:14	@Espyo	yeah, sucks
2016-05-21 21:31:22	@Espyo	at least, I'm not remembering any way to rotate the model sideways
2016-05-21 21:40:13	Marty2000	Well, I could gather some artworks of treasures from Google Image (JP) 
2016-05-21 21:41:02	Marty2000	Can I replace the thumbnail images with better images?

2016-05-21 22:02:23	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-21 22:02:41	Yoshi2	if I understand that right, he thinks Panther is a misspelling of Panzer because of the kind of similar pronounciation <<<<<<<<<<<<.<<<<<<<<<<<<
2016-05-21 22:03:49	Marty2000	...
2016-05-21 22:04:20	Yoshi2	also ironically he misspelled Volkswagen as Volkswagon

2016-05-22 11:44:40	Marty2000	Hello!
2016-05-22 11:44:50	Yoshi2	hi marty
2016-05-22 11:48:41	Yoshi2	Marty2000: what do you think about this first draft I wrote: https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/51586c9bdf5bbbf5aae6a593524dd696
2016-05-22 11:49:56	Marty2000	I think your explanation is very clear so they will understand
2016-05-22 11:50:04	Marty2000	Unless they're very fussy or stubborn :p
2016-05-22 11:50:53	Yoshi2	yup, I really hope they won't be fussy or stubborn :I
2016-05-22 11:52:29	Yoshi2	I also corrected "Volkswagon" to "Volkswagen" without directly mentioning that they made a typo
2016-05-22 11:52:50	Marty2000	Did they even give an explanation about why they deleted your edit?
2016-05-22 11:53:13	Marty2000	Well, reverted, if you prefer
2016-05-22 11:54:00	Yoshi2	https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Pikmin_2/Unused_%26_Early_Treasures&action=history
2016-05-22 11:54:11	Yoshi2	" (Undo revision 374175 by Yoshi2 (talk) It was the Panzer. You don't call Volkswagon "Folks' wagon".) "
2016-05-22 11:54:20	Marty2000	Be right back, I have to eat
2016-05-22 11:54:29	Yoshi2	rude
2016-05-22 11:54:34	Yoshi2	see ya
2016-05-22 12:06:57	Marty2000	Sorry, I'm back
2016-05-22 12:07:05	Marty2000	Why is it rude? I'm oging to check :/
2016-05-22 12:07:07	Marty2000	going*
2016-05-22 12:07:39	Yoshi2	well, going to eat right after asking me something is a little bit rude :p
2016-05-22 12:08:02	Marty2000	Hmm... I see :p And the reason for the "undo" is dumb anyway
2016-05-22 12:08:39	Yoshi2	to put more salt on the wound
2016-05-22 12:08:45	Marty2000	Volkswagon in particular, he he
2016-05-22 12:09:04	Yoshi2	the guy who initially changed Panther to Panzer
2016-05-22 12:09:05	Yoshi2	https://tcrf.net/Special:Contributions/Metalmallow
2016-05-22 12:09:20	Yoshi2	that's his only contribution
2016-05-22 12:09:20	Marty2000	I see... it's his only edit
2016-05-22 12:13:17	Marty2000	Anyway, that's a bit of a problem if they always revert those edits... that means they change true pieces of information to false ones.
2016-05-22 12:14:41	Marty2000	And Volkswagon... seriously, they correct what they call a mistake (which is not one, according to you) and they make a mistake themselves :p
2016-05-22 12:15:21	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen
2016-05-22 12:16:01	Marty2000	Oh no, the mistake wasn't Volkswagen but the panther/panzer
2016-05-22 12:16:14	Marty2000	I do know we write Volkswagen
2016-05-22 12:17:24	Yoshi2	I will run the text by espyo when he comes on, and next week or so I will actually put it up
2016-05-22 12:18:48	Yoshi2	preferably at a good time when he/other admins can see it :P

2016-05-22 12:58:51	Marty2000	Hello Espyo and Testyo
2016-05-22 12:58:52	Testyo	I'm not following what this new law you'd come up with was
2016-05-22 12:59:14	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-22 12:59:32	Marty2000	I have the name for the [[Pig Father]]
2016-05-22 12:59:32	Testyo	"Pig_Father" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pig_Father
2016-05-22 12:59:36	Marty2000	It is "Milk Cover"
2016-05-22 13:00:59	@Espyo	aha
2016-05-22 13:01:03	@Espyo	good to know
2016-05-22 13:01:18	@Espyo	I'll rename it, then
2016-05-22 13:01:40	Marty2000	Yep :)
2016-05-22 13:02:15	Marty2000	She told me that it's not good Japanese though (in that it's not correct grammar). Also, it could be impolite if said like that in Japanese...
2016-05-22 13:05:32	@Espyo	according to the sites we checked, the definition for milk is more like breast-milk or breast
2016-05-22 13:05:34	@Espyo	so I can guess why
2016-05-22 13:05:42	@Espyo	probably explains the poor grammar too
2016-05-22 13:05:46	Marty2000	Yes.
2016-05-22 13:05:55	@Espyo	it's like if we called it something like "Breastfeeding Cover"
2016-05-22 13:06:09	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-22 13:06:11	@Espyo	it's a NAME, but not a very logical one, and it's kinda impolite
2016-05-22 13:06:12	@Espyo	neat
2016-05-22 13:06:19	Yoshi2	are bras breastfeeding covers? 
2016-05-22 13:06:20	@Espyo	still, I think that "Milk Cover" as a translation is the way to go
2016-05-22 13:06:28	@Espyo	you just blew my mind
2016-05-22 13:06:41	@Espyo	the more I think about it, the more right it is
2016-05-22 13:07:17	Marty2000	Really? Ha ha. But "Milk Cover" is probably the best translation 
2016-05-22 13:07:22	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-22 13:07:37	@Espyo	it's like any other cover
2016-05-22 13:07:41	@Espyo	a cover for a bottle of milk
2016-05-22 13:07:46	@Espyo	you cover the bottle while it's not in use
2016-05-22 13:07:48	@Espyo	same thing for breastfeeding
2016-05-22 13:07:51	@Espyo	this is actually blowing my mind
2016-05-22 13:07:56	@Espyo	can't stop laughing
2016-05-22 13:08:42	Marty2000	That's probably why we had "Pig" as a translation... ha ha
2016-05-22 13:08:51	Marty2000	Pig Faher... 
2016-05-22 13:08:51	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-05-22 13:09:00	@Espyo	nah, pig was because of buta
2016-05-22 13:09:02	Marty2000	More like Pig Mother
2016-05-22 13:09:03	@Espyo	that translates to pig
2016-05-22 13:09:05	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-22 13:11:56	Yoshi2	Espyo: I finished a first draft of the text I will put on the talk page: https://gist.github.com/RenolY2/51586c9bdf5bbbf5aae6a593524dd696 
2016-05-22 13:13:05	@Espyo	seems good to me, but where will you be adding these images?
2016-05-22 13:14:56	Yoshi2	I will probably upload them on tcrf and add them as links to the talk page
2016-05-22 13:15:18	Yoshi2	probably these two: https://i.imgur.com/NXip5Ql.png https://i.imgur.com/ey7uMIF.png
2016-05-22 13:15:36	Yoshi2	(the red border is from the snipping tool I used, probably should remove it)
2016-05-22 13:17:04	@Espyo	not sure if they'll appreciate that
2016-05-22 13:17:09	@Espyo	might as well just link to imgur
2016-05-22 13:17:58	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-05-22 13:24:20	Yoshi2	I thought they prefered uploading screenshots on tcrf but maybe that is only for screenshots on articles
2016-05-22 13:24:50	@Espyo	pretty much, really
2016-05-22 13:27:00	Yoshi2	so my goals for my talk page text is 1) show that there is an actual difference between "Panzer" and "Panther" and 2) the tank turret is definitely the one of a "Panther" tank
2016-05-22 13:27:11	Yoshi2	seems good, or not?

2016-05-22 15:28:45	@Espyo	seems enough to me
2016-05-22 15:28:51	@Espyo	the concept of images should be like:
2016-05-22 15:28:59	@Espyo	we use the text to explain the treasure, what it is, how to obtain it, etc.
2016-05-22 15:29:13	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-22 15:29:13	@Espyo	we use images to show the user what the treasure looks like, without having to painstakingly detail everything
2016-05-22 15:29:22	Marty2000	I usually add images of:
2016-05-22 15:29:25	@Espyo	so long as the images we have are enough to show what the treasure is like, that's all we need
2016-05-22 15:29:30	Marty2000	the original location of the treasure
2016-05-22 15:29:34	UltraMario	hey espyo that weirdo joined the mario boards and posted the hitler pic in the real life photos thread

2016-05-22 15:29:39	UltraMario	:P
2016-05-22 15:29:42	@Espyo	there's no other angle, really

2016-05-22 15:30:21	@Espyo	and it makes sense to add an image of said angle
2016-05-22 15:30:26	@Espyo	otherwise, it's enough
2016-05-22 15:30:33	@Espyo	the readers can understand what the treasure looks like just fine

2016-05-22 16:20:35	@Espyo	what sublevel was that on?
2016-05-22 16:21:12	Marty2000	Sublevel 3 of the Subterranena Complex
2016-05-22 16:21:53	Marty2000	Subterranean*
2016-05-22 16:22:59	@Espyo	Fkabuto_bolt 10

2016-05-22 16:23:17	@Espyo	FKabuto is buried
2016-05-22 16:23:22	@Espyo	and it has the treasure "bolt"
2016-05-22 16:23:41	Marty2000	I know
2016-05-22 16:23:48	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-22 16:24:02	@Espyo	so, you found one of the walking ones buried
2016-05-22 16:24:05	Marty2000	To have a walking A.C.L get buried, I made it go out of its territory
2016-05-22 16:24:15	@Espyo	oh, so it transforms midway through?
2016-05-22 16:24:18	Marty2000	I turned it buried
2016-05-22 16:24:24	Marty2000	That's quite difficult
2016-05-22 16:24:25	@Espyo	I thought it was just a question of reloading the sublevel until it happened
2016-05-22 16:24:26	Marty2000	But basically
2016-05-22 16:24:40	Marty2000	You need to use sprays and such to make it go out of its territory
2016-05-22 16:24:49	Marty2000	So it tries to get back to he center of its territory
2016-05-22 16:24:53	Marty2000	But cannot because of walls
2016-05-22 16:24:59	Marty2000	And if it goes too far
2016-05-22 16:25:06	Marty2000	You just have to throw a Purple Pikmin
2016-05-22 16:25:13	Marty2000	And it freezes, then bury
2016-05-22 16:25:16	Marty2000	buries*
2016-05-22 16:26:28	Marty2000	I could try to make a complete video one day, but it's very long, so probably not today
2016-05-22 16:27:08	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-22 16:27:15	@Espyo	sounds like a panic handler for the case where it cannot get to its home
2016-05-22 16:27:33	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-22 16:27:56	Marty2000	What's funny is that you can stun it, unlike the regular buried larva
2016-05-22 16:28:02	Marty2000	I was surprised when it happened
2016-05-22 16:28:18	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-22 16:28:25	@Espyo	because it still has Kabuto's properties
2016-05-22 16:28:27	@Espyo	not FKabuto's
2016-05-22 16:28:31	@Espyo	because it still is a Kabuto
2016-05-22 16:28:37	Marty2000	Yes...
2016-05-22 16:29:00	@Espyo	so, let's see...
2016-05-22 16:29:07	Marty2000	However, why can't FKabuto get stunned since there are properties for it to be stunned?
2016-05-22 16:29:13	@Espyo	looks like this Kabuto spawns on that little edge with a blue floor
2016-05-22 16:29:15	@Espyo	because Pikmin 2
2016-05-22 16:29:25	Marty2000	Yes, it's that one
2016-05-22 16:29:32	Marty2000	I see :p
2016-05-22 16:29:40	@Espyo	so, why can't you make it walk off this platform?
2016-05-22 16:29:43	@Espyo	it should be easy
2016-05-22 16:29:46	@Espyo	and it should be enable to return
2016-05-22 16:29:57	Marty2000	You can make this one fall off
2016-05-22 16:30:02	Marty2000	That's the one I was talking about
2016-05-22 16:30:26	Marty2000	You need luck for it to move close enough,
2016-05-22 16:30:33	Marty2000	Then you can use sprays and push it a little
2016-05-22 16:30:42	Marty2000	And the wall will prevent it from getting back
2016-05-22 16:30:52	Marty2000	It will make it walk to the corner instead
2016-05-22 16:31:07	Testyo	Dim Labyrinth is the exception, because yeah :P
2016-05-22 16:31:26	Marty2000	Because Pikmin 3, Testyo :p
2016-05-22 16:31:27	Testyo	it'd be more convenient if here's there
2016-05-22 16:32:00	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-05-22 16:32:02	--	sleepi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami

2016-05-22 16:32:23	Marty2000	I'll try to get the glitch happen again, Espyo
2016-05-22 16:32:28	Marty2000	I'll record, so it'd be more precise
2016-05-22 16:32:34	@Espyo	that'd be nice, thanks
2016-05-22 16:32:47	Marty2000	But it's long, so maybe I won't be able to have it today
2016-05-22 16:32:49	Marty2000	But let's try
2016-05-22 16:32:56	@Espyo	that's a scary thought
2016-05-22 16:32:58	@Espyo	good luck
2016-05-22 16:33:08	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-22 16:33:11	Marty2000	Yeah...
2016-05-22 16:33:25	Marty2000	That's really a hard glitch
2016-05-22 16:33:28	Marty2000	But not impossible
2016-05-22 16:33:41	Marty2000	(unlike the Beady Long Legs out of the arena)
2016-05-22 16:33:46	Marty2000	(in P1)

2016-05-22 16:42:08	Marty2000	I had it go out of its territory, but I threw my single Purple Pikmin in a pit... let's restart
2016-05-22 16:44:13	@Espyo	lol
2016-05-22 16:59:47	Yoshi2	Espyo: do you think I should make the tcrf talk page at a time when the same admin is more likely to see it?
2016-05-22 17:03:07	@Espyo	well, yesterday by the time that happened, he changed his name to einstein|sleep
2016-05-22 17:03:08	@Espyo	so
2016-05-22 17:03:38	Yoshi2	mhm, so I probably should just do it whenever
2016-05-22 17:04:36	Yoshi2	my entire faith in tcrf hinges on how well this will be resolved
2016-05-22 17:12:12	Marty2000	This will take a lot of time, I'm afraid
2016-05-22 17:14:09	Yoshi2	the question will be whether I win, or the guy with 0 contributions besides this one https://tcrf.net/Special:Contributions/Metalmallow

2016-05-22 17:20:55	UltraMario	hey espyo have you seen all the modding thats been done to smash wii u lately?
2016-05-22 17:20:55	UltraMario	it
2016-05-22 17:21:01	UltraMario	's pretty impressive
2016-05-22 17:21:02	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-22 17:21:11	UltraMario	it's picking up fast
2016-05-22 17:21:49	Yoshi2	UltraMario: are people making assembler hacks yet, or custom models?
2016-05-22 17:24:40	UltraMario	well
2016-05-22 17:24:45	UltraMario	there's been vertexing
2016-05-22 17:25:05	UltraMario	model imports arent a thing yet (from other games), but i have faith we'll get there soon
2016-05-22 17:25:25	Yoshi2	UltraMario: what impressive stuff do you think can be done right now?
2016-05-22 17:25:37	UltraMario	well
2016-05-22 17:25:43	UltraMario	adding music
2016-05-22 17:25:55	UltraMario	rather than nreplacing music
2016-05-22 17:25:59	UltraMario	and vertex hacks
2016-05-22 17:26:03	UltraMario	and stage hacks
2016-05-22 17:26:40	Yoshi2	what kind of vertex/stage hacks
2016-05-22 17:28:11	UltraMario	theres a ridley vertex for  charizard
2016-05-22 17:28:14	UltraMario	that looks gr8
2016-05-22 17:29:19	Yoshi2	what kind of stage hacks are there?
2016-05-22 17:29:52	Yoshi2	I guess vertex hack is simply the manipulation of an existing model to give it a different form
2016-05-22 17:30:55	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-22 17:30:59	UltraMario	it's like shape editing
2016-05-22 17:31:05	UltraMario	also for stage hacks there's been like
2016-05-22 17:31:09	UltraMario	hazardless versions of stages
2016-05-22 17:31:13	UltraMario	and stuff like
2016-05-22 17:31:34	UltraMario	being able to play 8 player smash on ANY STAGE
2016-05-22 17:31:35	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-22 17:31:48	Yoshi2	pretty entry-level stuff 
2016-05-22 17:32:08	UltraMario	yup
2016-05-22 17:32:28	UltraMario	im pretty impressed that someone managed to get it to work on any stage tho
2016-05-22 17:32:30	UltraMario	without like
2016-05-22 17:32:32	UltraMario	slowdown
2016-05-22 17:32:33	UltraMario	or anything
2016-05-22 17:32:55	Yoshi2	I'm sure the game can handle 8 people on a stage
2016-05-22 17:33:06	UltraMario	ewll i mean
2016-05-22 17:33:12	Yoshi2	and the limitation is only due to balancing
2016-05-22 17:33:17	UltraMario	*well
2016-05-22 17:33:19	UltraMario	some of these stages are pretty nuts
2016-05-22 17:33:24	UltraMario	like jungle hijinx
2016-05-22 17:33:36	UltraMario	i heard 8 player smash on there is crazy
2016-05-22 17:33:39	UltraMario	because there's like
2016-05-22 17:33:44	UltraMario	4 people in the foreground
2016-05-22 17:33:47	UltraMario	and 4 in the bak
2016-05-22 17:33:49	UltraMario	*back
2016-05-22 17:34:34	Yoshi2	considering that assembler hacks aren't a thing yet, the game was already able to handle 8 players otherwise it wouldn't work as well as it does
2016-05-22 17:35:12	UltraMario	whats an assembler hack
2016-05-22 17:36:44	Yoshi2	assembler code is human-readable machine code
2016-05-22 17:37:28	Yoshi2	so an assembler hack attempts to directly change the behaviour of a game's code
2016-05-22 17:38:33	Yoshi2	if you've ever seen weird stuff in SMW hacks, like wall jump blocks, those are done through assembler hacks
2016-05-22 17:40:13	Marty2000	Well, Espyo, I can't manage to get it... I could record how to make it go out of territory, though. The rest is pure luck
2016-05-22 17:44:16	-->	UnknownPikmin (Mibbit@mjyr-02-564-93-585.knology.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-22 17:44:26	UnknownPikmin	Hello.
2016-05-22 17:44:41	Yoshi2	hi
2016-05-22 17:45:20	UnknownPikmin	why is the limit set to 100 pikmin?
2016-05-22 17:46:12	Marty2000	Hello 
2016-05-22 17:46:19	UnknownPikmin	maybe if more than 100 are on the field, the game might crash
2016-05-22 17:46:25	Yoshi2	because nintendo has decided that 100 pikmin is the best limit
2016-05-22 17:46:39	Yoshi2	I'm sure the game could handle more than 100
2016-05-22 17:46:39	Marty2000	Hmm, probably because it would be hard to manage more than 100 Pikmin
2016-05-22 17:47:09	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] User account UnknownPikmin created http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:UnknownPikmin
2016-05-22 17:47:24	UnknownPikmin	there might be a glitch that might softlock if you exceed 999 pikmin
2016-05-22 17:48:09	UnknownPikmin	it might be laggy if there were 999 pikmin on the field
2016-05-22 17:48:36	Yoshi2	the game would also be completely unplayable even if it wasn't laggy
2016-05-22 17:48:46	Yoshi2	because the 999 pikmin would fill your entire screen
2016-05-22 17:49:12	Yoshi2	and pikmin would die by the hundreds against some of the enemies
2016-05-22 17:49:33	UnknownPikmin	1 more pikmin could crash your game if there were 999
2016-05-22 17:50:29	Yoshi2	I don't think anybody has tried to raise the limit, so we don't know if the game would crash
2016-05-22 17:51:02	Marty2000	If you are talking about how many pikmin the Onion can contain, you can have more than 1000 easily in Pikmin and Pikmin 3
2016-05-22 17:51:10	UnknownPikmin	Pikmin Extinctions though :'(
2016-05-22 17:51:10	Marty2000	And more than 10 000 easily in Pikmin 2 ;)
2016-05-22 17:51:41	Marty2000	If you are talking about the Pikmin that you can control, I don't think it would be possible to have more than 100
2016-05-22 17:51:44	Marty2000	Even with hacks
2016-05-22 17:51:48	Marty2000	Probably hard-coded

2016-05-22 17:53:03	UltraMario	ooooh
2016-05-22 17:53:03	UltraMario	well
2016-05-22 17:53:05	UltraMario	Yoshi2: 
2016-05-22 17:53:12	UltraMario	theres been some progress in like
2016-05-22 17:53:15	UltraMario	moveset hacking
2016-05-22 17:53:22	UltraMario	it's nothing too groundbreaking yet
2016-05-22 17:53:27	Yoshi2	mmm, that's neat
2016-05-22 17:53:30	UltraMario	but it's s something
2016-05-22 17:53:32	UnknownPikmin	probably the most annoying glitch is the game calling a pikmin extinction when some pikmin are still alive
2016-05-22 17:53:35	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-22 17:53:36	Yoshi2	but nothing like project m
2016-05-22 17:53:38	UltraMario	we're getting there
2016-05-22 17:53:40	UltraMario	well
2016-05-22 17:53:42	UltraMario	not yet, obv
2016-05-22 17:53:47	UltraMario	smash 4 modding still has a ways to go
2016-05-22 17:53:48	UltraMario	but
2016-05-22 17:53:53	UltraMario	it's steadily progressing
2016-05-22 17:54:01	UltraMario	definitely picked up faster than brawl modding i think
2016-05-22 17:54:26	UnknownPikmin	you stole my unique pikmins
2016-05-22 17:54:30	Yoshi2	makes sense, because brawl was the first game with such big modding interest
2016-05-22 17:54:34	UltraMario	true
2016-05-22 17:54:40	UltraMario	in the smash series, anyway
2016-05-22 17:54:42	UnknownPikmin	can i has easy retrieve?
2016-05-22 17:54:46	Yoshi2	and all that just carried over to smash 4
2016-05-22 17:54:46	UltraMario	wat
2016-05-22 17:54:51	UltraMario	yup
2016-05-22 17:55:37	UnknownPikmin	what glitch do you think is the most annoying?
2016-05-22 17:55:42	UltraMario	depends
2016-05-22 17:55:51	UltraMario	what game are we talking about here
2016-05-22 17:55:54	UltraMario	or is it general
2016-05-22 17:55:57	@Espyo	UltraMario: yeah, I'm not following it actively, but damn, there are some great mods out already
2016-05-22 17:56:01	UltraMario	yup
2016-05-22 17:56:08	@Espyo	Marty2000: damn... I'll have to try to think about the logic behind it one day
2016-05-22 17:56:09	UltraMario	there's already a louie vertex for olimar
2016-05-22 17:56:09	UltraMario	:D
2016-05-22 17:56:10	UnknownPikmin	 pikmin, any game.
2016-05-22 17:56:16	@Espyo	to see if there's some sense about when it does or doesn't transform
2016-05-22 17:56:45	UnknownPikmin	Espyo: what glitch is the most annoying in pikmin?
2016-05-22 17:56:47	Marty2000	Yep. And UnknownPikmin, I don't like the glitch that makes an item impossible to retrivee
2016-05-22 17:57:07	UnknownPikmin	I agree.
2016-05-22 17:57:13	@Espyo	hm, not sure
2016-05-22 17:57:18	Marty2000	retrieve*
2016-05-22 17:57:21	@Espyo	but Pikmin attacking on their own has to be up there in terms of annoying mechanics
2016-05-22 17:57:34	UltraMario	theres already quite a bit of melee mods i could use for the tourney
2016-05-22 17:57:36	UltraMario	so that's cool
2016-05-22 17:57:49	Yoshi2	I don't like the sync issue in pikmin 3 bingo mode
2016-05-22 17:57:49	UnknownPikmin	Cause you won't get the good ending if the glitch happens.
2016-05-22 17:57:50	UltraMario	like there's one that replaces the intro with the melee intro
2016-05-22 17:58:00	UltraMario	and some mods bring back melee voices
2016-05-22 17:58:09	Yoshi2	pikmin fighting each other for a while, and then they stop attacking and just disappear
2016-05-22 17:58:13	UltraMario	so far there's one for mario, falco, fox, link, and young link
2016-05-22 17:58:17	UltraMario	oh
2016-05-22 17:58:22	UltraMario	and the announcer
2016-05-22 17:58:31	UltraMario	SUPER SMASH BROTHERS... MELEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2016-05-22 17:58:35	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-22 17:58:45	UnknownPikmin	also, pikmin going out-of-bounds is annoying too
2016-05-22 17:59:03	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-22 17:59:49	UnknownPikmin	becaus they might die when the glitch happens
2016-05-22 18:00:43	Marty2000	Oh, I see what you mean. When they are under a bridge, they often die (always for me)
2016-05-22 18:01:07	Marty2000	That's quite troublesome, bothersome, tiresome... every adjective like those ones
2016-05-22 18:01:08	UnknownPikmin	Pikmin-killing bridge, eh?
2016-05-22 18:01:44	UnknownPikmin	That seems annoying, even when it causes a pikmin extinction.
2016-05-22 18:02:50	UltraMario	hey Marty2000, you didnt download that mod pack, did you

2016-05-22 18:11:37	Marty2000	I'm trying to figure out how many Pikmin you can have in the Onions or Ship in P2
2016-05-22 18:11:40	UltraMario	UnknownPikmin: just because this is a chat for a pikmin wiki doesnt mean thats all we should talk about, you know
2016-05-22 18:11:41	UltraMario	:v
2016-05-22 18:11:52	UltraMario	also the smashwiki irc is pretty dead i heard lol
2016-05-22 18:12:24	UnknownPikmin	I heard that melee was turned into a pikmin.
2016-05-22 18:12:38	UltraMario	wat
2016-05-22 18:13:08	Yoshi2	I have never heard of super smash bros melee being turned into a pikmin
2016-05-22 18:13:19	UnknownPikmin	*pikmins get a mini nuke*
2016-05-22 18:13:36	UnknownPikmin	its a bomb!
2016-05-22 18:13:48	Marty2000	Or a microwave too
2016-05-22 18:14:19	UnknownPikmin	what is pikmin combustion?
2016-05-22 18:15:17	UnknownPikmin	...

2016-05-22 18:15:48	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-05-22 18:15:49	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-22 18:16:11	UnknownPikmin	yet a glitch occured latly
2016-05-22 18:16:19	UnknownPikmin	lately*
2016-05-22 18:17:22	UnknownPikmin	all of my pikmins disappeared
2016-05-22 18:17:27	@Espyo	oh, by reaching the limit yourself?
2016-05-22 18:17:32	@Espyo	you'd probably need dozens of years
2016-05-22 18:17:36	@Espyo	your best bet is to try with cheats
2016-05-22 18:17:42	UnknownPikmin	and the game didn't call a pikmin extinction
2016-05-22 18:17:46	Marty2000	Espyo: I'll try with cheats
2016-05-22 18:17:48	UnknownPikmin	so...
2016-05-22 18:18:08	Marty2000	Right now, in my Wii save, without cheats, I have nearly 80 000 Pikmin, though
2016-05-22 18:18:19	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-22 18:18:19	Marty2000	But I'll try with cheats
2016-05-22 18:18:27	UnknownPikmin	my day was temporarily softlocked with no pikmin
2016-05-22 18:18:42	Marty2000	Oh?
2016-05-22 18:19:15	UnknownPikmin	no-pikmin softlock glitch confirmed
2016-05-22 18:20:30	UnknownPikmin	LoL
2016-05-22 18:20:56	UnknownPikmin	i wasnt talking about league of legends
2016-05-22 18:21:24	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-22 18:21:29	Marty2000	I thought so ( :p )
2016-05-22 18:21:36	UnknownPikmin	i had to wait for the day to end to get rid of the no-pikmin softlock curse
2016-05-22 18:21:43	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-22 18:21:47	Marty2000	Strange glitch...
2016-05-22 18:22:15	UnknownPikmin	Strange indeed.
2016-05-22 18:22:31	UnknownPikmin	By the way...
2016-05-22 18:22:32	Marty2000	Espyo, I'll try to find the cap with White Pikmin
2016-05-22 18:22:49	Marty2000	I have a cheat that allow me to have +100 new White Pikmin by entering a cave
2016-05-22 18:22:53	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-05-22 18:22:56	Marty2000	allows*
2016-05-22 18:23:19	UnknownPikmin	Has anyone else been hit with the No-Pikmin Softlock Curse?
2016-05-22 18:23:54	Marty2000	I don't know... I don't think so

2016-05-22 18:24:24	UnknownPikmin	Well, the glitch occurs when you exceed 999 pikmin
2016-05-22 18:25:06	UnknownPikmin	Could've been called the 1000-Pikmin Softlock Curse...
2016-05-22 18:25:43	UnknownPikmin	but all your Pikmin disappear when the limit is exceeded.
2016-05-22 18:26:01	UnknownPikmin	Spooky.

2016-05-22 18:26:10	Marty2000	Oh no
2016-05-22 18:26:14	Marty2000	They don't disappear
2016-05-22 18:26:17	Marty2000	You can have them again
2016-05-22 18:26:19	Marty2000	Wait...
2016-05-22 18:27:03	Marty2000	I think we have a video of this on Pikipedia
2016-05-22 18:27:15	UnknownPikmin	The lag still takes effect when the glitch occurs
2016-05-22 18:27:39	@Espyo	that'll still likely make you take a few years...
2016-05-22 18:27:48	@Espyo	we need to edit the variable that houses the number of Pikmin
2016-05-22 18:27:50	@Espyo	to a really high value
2016-05-22 18:27:52	@Espyo	see how far it goes
2016-05-22 18:28:01	UnknownPikmin	so it may take up to 1 hour for the day to end when the glitch is performed
2016-05-22 18:28:08	Marty2000	Don't worry Espyo, I'll take care of it ;)
2016-05-22 18:28:54	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYevjYhEUpc
2016-05-22 18:29:02	Marty2000	See, you still have 1000 Pikmin
2016-05-22 18:30:10	Marty2000	Anyway, I know you can easily have 99 999 Pikmin in an Onion in P2
2016-05-22 18:30:14	Marty2000	I don't know if you can go higher
2016-05-22 18:31:25	UnknownPikmin	:O
2016-05-22 18:32:03	UnknownPikmin	the counter displays erroneous numbers when it exceeds 1000
2016-05-22 18:32:40	UnknownPikmin	what if you have 100000 pikmin in P2?
2016-05-22 18:32:48	Marty2000	I don't know for P2
2016-05-22 18:32:53	Marty2000	I am trying to know
2016-05-22 18:33:21	UnknownPikmin	Maybe a 100000-Pikmin Softlock?
2016-05-22 18:33:29	Marty2000	Possible
2016-05-22 18:34:23	UnknownPikmin	Maybe we should post up the No-Pikmin Softlock on the glitch page
2016-05-22 18:35:24	UnknownPikmin	But we should make it a rumor, or maybe unofficial
2016-05-22 18:36:17	Marty2000	Right now, Espyo
2016-05-22 18:36:22	Marty2000	On my save with the cheat
2016-05-22 18:36:28	Marty2000	I have more than 6000 White Pikmin
2016-05-22 18:37:38	Yoshi2	Marty2000: couldn't you alter the cheat to give you more than 100 pikmin at a time?
2016-05-22 18:38:09	Marty2000	No... but it gives me 100+ when I enter a cave, a sublevel, or a finish a day
2016-05-22 18:38:50	Marty2000	It'll take some time, but that's not impossible
2016-05-22 18:39:16	Marty2000	I use the Cavern of Chaos+Moon Jump to go as fast as possible
2016-05-22 18:39:24	Yoshi2	why can't you alter it to give you more than 100 pikmin?
2016-05-22 18:39:35	Marty2000	Because I can't.
2016-05-22 18:39:43	Marty2000	Actually, that's different
2016-05-22 18:39:56	Marty2000	That code gives you 100 Pikmin to start with
2016-05-22 18:40:10	Yoshi2	ahhh
2016-05-22 18:40:11	Marty2000	And they're stored in the sip becasue the cheat replaces them when you enter a cave, sublevel...

2016-05-22 18:40:41	Yoshi2	is there no way to alter the counter in the onion/ship directly?
2016-05-22 18:40:42	Marty2000	I can't use the code that gives you 9999 Pikmin in Onions because it deletes any new Pikmin that enters the Onion
2016-05-22 18:40:50	Marty2000	I don't think so...
2016-05-22 18:42:11	Marty2000	Right now, I have more than 7000 Pikmin
2016-05-22 18:43:28	Yoshi2	in theory, it shouldn't be difficult to make a cheat which gives you as many pikmin as necessary in the onion
2016-05-22 18:43:59	Yoshi2	stand near the onion and take out and put in pikmin and use dolphin to filter values based on whether the value went up or down

2016-05-22 19:00:49	@Espyo	the number might be in the 30k+

2016-05-23 16:31:08	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2016-05-23 16:31:15	@PikFan	hi Yoshi2
2016-05-23 16:31:31	@PikFan	how's that Panzer/Panther business going on?
2016-05-23 16:31:56	Yoshi2	haven't dealt with it yet, will likely do it later this week
2016-05-23 16:32:11	@PikFan	heh, I see
2016-05-23 16:32:33	@PikFan	well, I'll be rooting for you
2016-05-23 16:32:42	Yoshi2	in the case it doesn't work out the way I want it, I'd rather have that happen when my hands aren't full of homework
2016-05-23 16:32:53	@PikFan	fun
2016-05-23 16:34:06	@PikFan	uh, what http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Abductionbug&curid=6973&diff=53250&oldid=52983
2016-05-23 16:34:23	@PikFan	except that Category:Fanon IS a repetitive category :|
2016-05-23 16:34:49	@PikFan	Cheepy will keep me busy
2016-05-23 16:35:47	Yoshi2	what is a repetitive category?
2016-05-23 16:36:30	@PikFan	when an article has two categories on it but one of the category is a subcategory of the other
2016-05-23 16:36:53	Yoshi2	ah
2016-05-23 16:36:54	@PikFan	so the larger category is considered repetitive
2016-05-23 16:37:20	@PikFan	you want articles to have the most specific category, usually
2016-05-23 16:37:44	@PikFan	anyway, not just that, this Category:Fanon is useless
2016-05-23 16:37:57	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-05-23 16:38:05	@PikFan	because a) the entire wiki is fanon and b) not all the pages are marked with it
2016-05-23 16:38:12	Yoshi2	yeah, Category:Fanon is VERY unspecific
2016-05-23 16:38:33	@PikFan	...oh, new messages, yay
2016-05-23 16:38:48	@PikFan	oh wait, I've already read these
2016-05-23 16:38:53	@PikFan	I just never logged in :P
2016-05-23 16:39:06	Yoshi2	I also saw some stupidity on wikipedia: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Bradley_Fighting_Vehicle_provides_security_for_clearing_operation_in_Iraq.jpg
2016-05-23 16:39:22	Yoshi2	the title of the image is Bradley Fighting Vehicle provides security for clearing operation in Iraq
2016-05-23 16:39:27	@PikFan	wow
2016-05-23 16:39:32	Yoshi2	and somebody cropped out the vehicle
2016-05-23 16:40:11	@PikFan	that's dumb
2016-05-23 16:40:48	Yoshi2	I can kinda see what their intention was because the building in the background is Taq Kasra
2016-05-23 16:40:48	Yoshi2	 or so
2016-05-23 16:40:50	Yoshi2	but no
2016-05-23 16:40:56	Yoshi2	you DON'T do that
2016-05-23 16:41:21	@PikFan	I seriously have to wonder why some people have accounts
2016-05-23 16:41:33	Yoshi2	you don't crop out the vehicle just because you don't like it
2016-05-23 16:41:44	@PikFan	yeah, it's retarded
2016-05-23 16:41:58	@PikFan	...not the vehicle, the act of cropping it out, I mean
2016-05-23 16:42:17	@PikFan	political correctness much
2016-05-23 16:44:09	Yoshi2	I even think cropping the vehicle out like that is unwanted, so I should be able to get it reverted
2016-05-23 16:44:12	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Image_use_policy#Cropping
2016-05-23 16:44:28	Yoshi2	but maybe I should make an account first
2016-05-23 16:44:34	@PikFan	hah
2016-05-23 16:44:45	@PikFan	how did you find that, anyway?
2016-05-23 16:45:51	@PikFan	gaaaaaaaaaah
2016-05-23 16:45:58	@PikFan	why are you doing this, Fanon
2016-05-23 16:46:05	Yoshi2	by chance because I was reading this article: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%BCtzenpanzer#Bewaffnung
2016-05-23 16:46:20	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-23 16:46:53	Yoshi2	the image on the right did not show any fighting vehicle at all, even though the caption refered to a vehicle in the photo
2016-05-23 16:47:05	@PikFan	yeah

2016-05-23 16:53:11	Yoshi2	I also need to make a battalion wars 1 article on tcrf with those screenshots I uploaded, or they might be deleted
2016-05-23 16:55:54	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-23 16:56:18	Yoshi2	but I lost the page that had the release dates of the game
2016-05-23 16:58:04	@PikFan	lovely
2016-05-23 16:58:37	@PikFan	but what do you mean, you lost them? does nobody know when the release dates are?
2016-05-23 16:58:49	@PikFan	*were
2016-05-23 16:59:11	Yoshi2	I mean there was a cool website somebody gave me the link to which had the release dates of many games
2016-05-23 16:59:16	Yoshi2	and I lost the link to that website
2016-05-23 16:59:28	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-23 16:59:42	@PikFan	well, that's inconvenient
2016-05-23 17:00:07	@PikFan	my first thought would be vgchartz, but that's definitely not right
2016-05-23 17:02:11	Yoshi2	I think espyo knows the website
2016-05-23 17:02:19	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-23 17:03:06	Yoshi2	I think it started with m and I will probably recognize it when I see it
2016-05-23 17:06:29	Yoshi2	obviously the website is not the only way to find out the release dates, I just thought the website would be nice to have at hand
2016-05-23 17:06:59	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-23 17:09:43	@PikFan	oh, so LoganPikmin just apologized to me for no reason
2016-05-23 17:09:54	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User_talk:PikFan23&redirect=no#Sorry.3F
2016-05-23 17:10:55	Yoshi2	maybe he is apologizing for the unhelpful fanfic review
2016-05-23 17:11:09	Yoshi2	(probably not)
2016-05-23 17:13:08	@PikFan	hah
2016-05-23 17:13:22	@PikFan	oh, speaking of, did you ever manage to read more of it?
2016-05-23 17:13:39	@PikFan	warning, Chapter 3 was...hastily written
2016-05-23 17:13:44	Yoshi2	not yet
2016-05-23 17:13:56	@PikFan	it's probably the lowest-quality chapter
2016-05-23 17:14:13	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-05-23 17:14:24	@PikFan	what about the prologue needs improvement, though?
2016-05-23 17:23:02	Yoshi2	" Having been in the Onions so long, they were in an "intellectual stasis" of sorts." reads a bit odd. Was the intellectual stasis happening while the pikmin were in the onions, or was the intellectual stasis after they got out of the onions after a very long time?
2016-05-23 17:23:25	@PikFan	ah, I see your confusion
2016-05-23 17:24:08	@PikFan	yeah, the "intellectual stasis" is after they come out of the Onions
2016-05-23 17:24:42	@PikFan	in P1 and 2, they follow simple commands
2016-05-23 17:25:02	@PikFan	in P3, they're a bit more "intelligent", interacting with things in different ways
2016-05-23 17:25:21	@PikFan	but still nowhere near as intelligent as the Hocotatians/Koppaites
2016-05-23 17:25:38	@PikFan	so during the canon games, they're in this intellectual stasis
2016-05-23 17:25:48	@PikFan	but my story takes place after the canon games
2016-05-23 17:26:04	@PikFan	and by then, that stasis has ended, and the Pikmin are intelligent
2016-05-23 17:26:07	@PikFan	does all that make sense?
2016-05-23 17:27:04	Yoshi2	mhmm, yes
2016-05-23 17:27:23	@PikFan	lol, okay
2016-05-23 17:27:24	Yoshi2	but when were the pikmin intelligent before the events of Pikmin 1-3?
2016-05-23 17:27:39	@PikFan	hundreds of years, yeah
2016-05-23 17:28:12	Yoshi2	becoming intelligent again or unlocking the intelligence suggests that they were intelligent at some point, makes me wonder what happened
2016-05-23 17:28:23	Yoshi2	(though I guess that could be put into its own fanfic)
2016-05-23 17:28:33	@PikFan	well, okay
2016-05-23 17:28:51	@PikFan	hundreds of years before Olimar crashed, the Pikmin had a thriving civilization
2016-05-23 17:29:04	@PikFan	but then the monsters attacked, and the world plunged into war
2016-05-23 17:29:21	@PikFan	the Pikmin suffered heavy casualties and were nearly wiped out
2016-05-23 17:29:46	@PikFan	as their last defense, they created the Onions

2016-05-23 17:30:53	@PikFan	the Onions' purpose was twofold: to defend the Pikmin against the Onions by burrowing into the ground, and to repopulate the world with Pikmin when the time was right
2016-05-23 17:31:19	@PikFan	so when the new Pikmin are born hundreds of years later, they're in this intellectual stasis I talked about
2016-05-23 17:31:44	@PikFan	my backstory isn't really all that original
2016-05-23 17:31:56	@PikFan	very cliché
2016-05-23 17:32:17	@PikFan	...wait
2016-05-23 17:32:25	@PikFan	"to defend the Pikmin against the Onions"
2016-05-23 17:32:36	@PikFan	gah, I meant "to defend the Pikmin against the MONSTERS"
2016-05-23 17:32:37	Yoshi2	that makes some sense
2016-05-23 17:32:45	@PikFan	ugh, it's the morning, I'm tired
2016-05-23 17:33:10	@PikFan	so...yeah
2016-05-23 17:33:18	@PikFan	09:28:23	Yoshi2	(though I guess that could be put into its own fanfic)
2016-05-23 17:33:26	@PikFan	actually, I have been considering that
2016-05-23 17:34:19	Yoshi2	"[...] and created a grand Pikmin Republic, which spanned an entire continent." is the continent named in the story, or does it go unnamed?
2016-05-23 17:34:35	@PikFan	at some point, yes
2016-05-23 17:34:43	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-05-23 17:35:20	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/d/d6/Pangaeaultima_a.gtx.png
2016-05-23 17:35:43	@PikFan	basically the western half of that huge landmass
2016-05-23 17:36:19	Yoshi2	"The Republic began preparing for a potential war, securing its valuable assets and strengthening their defenses." their defenses as in the defenses of the Republic, or the defenses of the assets, or the defenses of the pikmins?
2016-05-23 17:36:45	@PikFan	defenses of the Republic and everything pertaining to it
2016-05-23 17:37:07	@PikFan	I tried making it descriptive, but I guess I added more words than necessary :P
2016-05-23 17:38:00	Yoshi2	the grammar nazi in me feels a bit like "its defenses", as in the defenses of the republic, would be more grammatically correct
2016-05-23 17:38:14	@PikFan	heh, alright
2016-05-23 17:38:15	@PikFan	noted
2016-05-23 17:38:45	@PikFan	or, I could change it to "the Pikmin strengthened their defenses"
2016-05-23 17:38:48	@PikFan	or something like that
2016-05-23 17:38:54	Yoshi2	yeah
2016-05-23 17:39:16	Yoshi2	that would make it feel more like the people's effort, rather than just the government's effort
2016-05-23 17:39:28	@PikFan	right
2016-05-23 17:39:37	@PikFan	anyway, it's almost 9:40
2016-05-23 17:39:44	@PikFan	I need to go to class
2016-05-23 17:39:58	@PikFan	thank you for the input, I appreciate it
2016-05-23 17:40:13	@PikFan	by the way: this is the improved version of my prologue you're reading
2016-05-23 17:40:18	@PikFan	the older version was a disaster
2016-05-23 17:40:28	Yoshi2	np, see ya. Had one more thing to say but I guess that will be for later
2016-05-23 17:40:45	@PikFan	I'll probably be on in a couple hours at lunch so you can tell me then if you remember
2016-05-23 17:40:50	@PikFan	anyway, see ya

2016-05-23 18:31:51	Yoshi2	it was about 3 hours ago
2016-05-23 18:32:23	Marty2000	I see...
2016-05-23 18:32:26	Marty2000	Thanks.
2016-05-23 18:32:53	Yoshi2	You forgot that you connected? That makes it even more mysterious.
2016-05-23 18:33:18	Yoshi2	:v)
2016-05-23 18:33:36	Marty2000	I was supposed to have Spanish class at that time
2016-05-23 18:33:46	Marty2000	Of course, I went to my Spanish class
2016-05-23 18:34:13	Marty2000	But I left my phone to a friend who needed it for answers about a work for tomorrow in English
2016-05-23 18:34:22	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-05-23 18:35:16	Yoshi2	o.ô
2016-05-23 18:35:24	Yoshi2	i was talking to an impostor?
2016-05-23 18:35:56	Marty2000	Uh... that still sounds strange... 
2016-05-23 18:36:38	Marty2000	I have a bad habit with my phone, I leave all my sessions open... 
2016-05-23 18:37:58	Yoshi2	do you also say Hi! shortly before leaving?
2016-05-23 18:38:33	Marty2000	I usually say "Hi!" when joining the chatroom
2016-05-23 18:38:40	Marty2000	But unless it's early in the morning... 
2016-05-23 18:38:47	Marty2000	I don't connect if it's for 5 minutes
2016-05-23 18:39:08	Yoshi2	so I WAS talking to an impostor
2016-05-23 18:39:13	Yoshi2	or possibly your friend
2016-05-23 18:39:22	Yoshi2	impostor is unlikely

2016-05-23 20:03:11	@Espyo	random though I had today:
2016-05-23 20:03:15	@Espyo	what's the largest object in P2?
2016-05-23 20:03:26	@Espyo	I thought about when tweaking the ship's beam on the engine today
2016-05-23 20:03:29	@Espyo	it doesn't like very big objects
2016-05-23 20:03:39	Yoshi2	olimar's mom
2016-05-23 20:03:47	@Espyo	WHEY
2016-05-23 20:03:57	@Espyo	anyway I'm checking the file that has data for corpses and treasures
2016-05-23 20:03:59	@Espyo	let's see...
2016-05-23 20:04:29	Yoshi2	the globe part was pretty big, I think
2016-05-23 20:06:14	@Espyo	smallest seems to be a radius of 5
2016-05-23 20:06:16	@Espyo	with two treasures
2016-05-23 20:06:28	@Espyo	largest is 60
2016-05-23 20:06:33	@Espyo	now to actually see what these are
2016-05-23 20:06:53	UltraMario	olimar's mom has got it going on
2016-05-23 20:07:28	@Espyo	"halloween"
2016-05-23 20:07:32	@Espyo	I guess that's the pumpkin
2016-05-23 20:08:05	@Espyo	it's probably also the heaviest
2016-05-23 20:08:55	@Espyo	smallest is Arboreal Frippery or Implement of Toil
2016-05-23 20:09:02	@Espyo	hm, I'd figure the Science Project would be here too
2016-05-23 20:09:14	@Espyo	its radius is 10
2016-05-23 20:09:35	Marty2000	I would have said the [[Doomsday Apparatus]] too
2016-05-23 20:09:35	Testyo	"Doomsday_Apparatus" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Doomsday_Apparatus
2016-05-23 20:10:22	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2016-05-23 20:10:24	@Espyo	in terms of weight
2016-05-23 20:10:38	@Espyo	but radius, it seems like the Possessed Squatch is the largest
2016-05-23 20:11:35	@Espyo	there's a fair number of treasures with weight 1 *shrug*
2016-05-23 20:11:46	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-23 20:11:48	@Espyo	ok, this can't be the weight
2016-05-23 20:11:51	@Espyo	since there's one here with 128
2016-05-23 20:11:53	@Espyo	and none with 1000
2016-05-23 20:11:54	@Espyo	so
2016-05-23 20:12:32	@Espyo	ok, this file doesn't say weights
2016-05-23 20:19:35	@Espyo	I'm gonna tweak this to check if it really is the radius
2016-05-23 20:19:42	@Espyo	time to make a tiny treasure huge
2016-05-23 20:20:32	@Espyo	...wait, how?
2016-05-23 20:20:36	@Espyo	I never replaced files on Linux
2016-05-23 20:20:41	@Espyo	hm, I need J's program
2016-05-23 20:20:44	@Espyo	which I don't have handy
2016-05-23 20:20:45	@Espyo	oh :(
2016-05-23 20:22:13	Yoshi2	I can dig it out if you want
2016-05-23 20:22:30	@Espyo	he has a download link somewhere
2016-05-23 20:22:48	@Espyo	http://ikn.org.uk/GCEdit found it
2016-05-23 20:25:25	@Espyo	what do I do with this
2016-05-23 20:25:34	@Espyo	this is Python... but there's a makefile?
2016-05-23 20:25:57	@Espyo	oh, I guess makefiles are language unspecific

2016-05-23 20:38:46	Yoshi2	hi pikfan
2016-05-23 20:39:11	@PikFan	hi
2016-05-23 20:40:04	Yoshi2	"One Pikmin is intertwined with that of countless others, and his actions would determine the fate of the world."
2016-05-23 20:40:38	Yoshi2	1) the usage of present tense in the first half and the "would" in the second half seems a bit odd, not sure if it is correct grammar like that
2016-05-23 20:40:47	Yoshi2	2) One pikmin is intertwined with that?
2016-05-23 20:40:54	Yoshi2	*with what
2016-05-23 20:40:59	@PikFan	...oh
2016-05-23 20:41:03	@PikFan	woops
2016-05-23 20:41:18	@PikFan	I meant One Pikmin's /fate/
2016-05-23 20:41:27	@PikFan	I accidentally left it out when I was revising
2016-05-23 20:42:08	@PikFan	and actually, I should change the whole thing to past tense, since the story is in past tense
2016-05-23 20:42:23	Yoshi2	fair enough
2016-05-23 20:42:38	Yoshi2	there is also a part where you wrote "back" twice
2016-05-23 20:42:42	Yoshi2	"they took back back their world, "
2016-05-23 20:42:51	@Espyo	nope... changing this "radius" attribute does not have any impact in-game
2016-05-23 20:42:56	@Espyo	so these attributes could as well be unused
2016-05-23 20:43:08	@PikFan	"One Pikmin's destiny was intertwined with countless others', and his actions would determine the fate of the world."
2016-05-23 20:43:18	@PikFan	still not sure about "would" though
2016-05-23 20:45:52	Yoshi2	if you change the first half of the sentence to past tence, I THINK would might work out, but I'm not sure
2016-05-23 20:46:23	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-23 20:46:29	@PikFan	oh, so I just got upset
2016-05-23 20:46:40	@PikFan	this story on fanfiction.net just got ANOTHER review
2016-05-23 20:46:45	@PikFan	it has 4 reviews now

2016-05-23 21:05:08	@J	IN CAPS
2016-05-23 21:05:08	@Espyo	in retrospect
2016-05-23 21:05:18	@J	taking after your brother Testyo
2016-05-23 21:05:18	Testyo	that was a video for the first game, but besides that, all we have is the talk page
2016-05-23 21:06:33	@J	TBH I expect it works in Wine because the GTK developers probably test in Wine instead of on Windows
2016-05-23 21:06:37	@J	would not be surprised
2016-05-23 21:08:47	@Espyo	honestly, yeah
2016-05-23 21:09:09	@Espyo	they probably have some way to test on windows proper, once every few months
2016-05-23 21:09:14	@Espyo	but ad-hoc tests go on Wine
2016-05-23 21:10:15	@Espyo	look, I can try again
2016-05-23 21:10:19	@Espyo	this time following instructions
2016-05-23 21:10:22	@Espyo	to see if it works fine
2016-05-23 21:10:44	@Espyo	but honestly, it works fine with Wine on the old windows binary I still had from the old laptop
2016-05-23 21:10:47	@Espyo	so I did what I needed
2016-05-23 21:12:47	@J	so sad

2016-05-23 21:26:02	Yoshi2	yes
2016-05-23 21:26:49	@Espyo	I imported my feeds from Feedly
2016-05-23 21:26:52	@Espyo	and it worked like a charm
2016-05-23 21:26:56	@Espyo	except
2016-05-23 21:27:09	@Espyo	on the folder view, I've got all of the top-level folders
2016-05-23 21:27:16	@Espyo	and they contain all of the individual feeds
2016-05-23 21:27:26	@Espyo	but I can't like open the top-level folders to see specific feeds
2016-05-23 21:27:30	@Espyo	I'm talking about RSS here, btw
2016-05-23 21:28:15	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-23 21:28:20	@Espyo	looks like that's not a problem with the import
2016-05-23 21:28:35	@Espyo	if I add feeds manually into the same folder
2016-05-23 21:28:43	@Espyo	I still get no way of opening the folder to see individual feeds
2016-05-23 21:28:59	Yoshi2	beats me, I don't use thunderbird for rss feeds
2016-05-23 21:29:06	Yoshi2	only plain old email
2016-05-23 21:29:17	@Espyo	I was using Feedly
2016-05-23 21:29:25	@Espyo	...until I realized that it deletes items older than a month

2016-05-23 21:45:10	@Espyo	but I gotta ask, what about when your items have images or video?
2016-05-23 21:46:20	Yoshi2	that means you have to give up getting dank memes through RSS

2016-05-23 22:07:59	@Espyo	I used to use addons on Firefox

2016-05-24 16:20:57	@PikFan	so, I did an INCREDIBLY selfish thing yesterday
2016-05-24 16:21:05	@PikFan	INCREDIBLY selfish
2016-05-24 16:21:14	@PikFan	I canceled my story
2016-05-24 16:21:36	@PikFan	I was looking at the same author again
2016-05-24 16:21:45	@PikFan	and then jealousy took over
2016-05-24 16:22:07	@PikFan	and...I deleted my story on fanfiction.net
2016-05-24 16:22:19	@PikFan	and proceeded to put cancelation notices on the wiki and forums
2016-05-24 16:22:46	@PikFan	but now that I think back on it...it might have been the right decision
2016-05-24 16:23:09	@PikFan	because I realized that I was getting way too obsessed over people reading, reviewing, etc
2016-05-24 16:23:23	@PikFan	I didn't care about my story anymore
2016-05-24 16:23:29	@PikFan	I cared about people reading it
2016-05-24 16:23:37	@PikFan	and that's not good for any story, period
2016-05-24 16:23:56	@PikFan	I became swallowed in my own greed
2016-05-24 16:24:01	@PikFan	and that destroyed my story
2016-05-24 16:24:20	@PikFan	so...
2016-05-24 16:24:48	@PikFan	I think I'll stay away from writing fanfics for a while
2016-05-24 16:24:52	@PikFan	for a /long/ while
2016-05-24 16:25:07	@PikFan	this way, I can reflect on my actions, and possibly improve my own writing
2016-05-24 16:26:57	@PikFan	so...yeah
2016-05-24 16:27:09	@PikFan	you may now carry on with your lives

2016-05-24 16:28:27	@PikFan	that's pretty much what I did
2016-05-24 16:28:53	@PikFan	"oh I want reviews waaaah" "oh here I'll give you some advice" "lol okay but I'm canceling my story lol"
2016-05-24 16:30:58	Yoshi2	it kinda sucks but could've been worse
2016-05-24 16:31:17	@PikFan	wait, what sucks
2016-05-24 16:31:20	@PikFan	the situation?
2016-05-24 16:31:31	@PikFan	or my story?
2016-05-24 16:31:32	Yoshi2	that you deleted the story
2016-05-24 16:31:35	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-24 16:32:00	Yoshi2	e.g. if it happened after I read through the story
2016-05-24 16:32:00	@PikFan	eh, it won't be missed on that website
2016-05-24 16:32:04	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-24 16:32:29	@PikFan	it'll probably be missed for a little while on the wiki/forums but then people will forget about it
2016-05-24 16:33:44	@PikFan	I was really cynical in my cancelation notice

2016-05-24 16:42:54	@PikFan	/maybe/
2016-05-24 16:43:15	@PikFan	not sure, I still want to stay away from the whole writing fanfic business again
2016-05-24 16:43:26	@PikFan	but yeah, I'll let you know
2016-05-24 16:46:14	@PikFan	so my friend wants to remake a Zelda game
2016-05-24 16:46:29	@PikFan	what programming language would she need to learn?
2016-05-24 16:46:29	Yoshi2	which one?
2016-05-24 16:46:47	@PikFan	er, wait, she says she wants to make her own
2016-05-24 16:47:07	Yoshi2	what style?
2016-05-24 16:47:25	@PikFan	3D, like OoT
2016-05-24 16:49:06	Yoshi2	does she have any programming experience?
2016-05-24 16:49:10	@PikFan	nope
2016-05-24 16:49:18	@PikFan	though, we've heard that Unity is good
2016-05-24 16:49:35	@PikFan	just looked it up and saw that it's the default SDK for the Wii U, so that's nice
2016-05-24 16:53:06	Yoshi2	unity might work for her
2016-05-24 16:53:15	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-24 16:54:18	Yoshi2	iirc Unity supports C# and javascript for programming stuff in

2016-05-24 16:56:27	@PikFan	ah
2016-05-24 16:56:42	Yoshi2	I've done some work in unity with a friend, we didn't get much done but it was some fun
2016-05-24 16:57:27	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-24 16:57:29	Yoshi2	game programming is quite a different beast from regular programming
2016-05-24 16:57:40	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-24 16:58:15	@PikFan	wait, isn't Espyo's fangame engine just made out of normal programming?
2016-05-24 16:59:09	Yoshi2	I mean regular programming as in writing windows applications which do stuff when you press a button
2016-05-24 16:59:37	@PikFan	my friend and I are both noobs :P
2016-05-24 17:01:20	Yoshi2	unity is quite special in that it is made in such a way so that you can make ANY game
2016-05-24 17:01:46	Yoshi2	so the complexity is different than with the pikmin engine which only allows pikmin games
2016-05-24 17:02:52	@PikFan	right
2016-05-24 17:04:05	Yoshi2	for example, we found a movement script for moving the main character which we plugged into our game
2016-05-24 17:04:24	Yoshi2	but we still needed a script for climbing the ladder
2016-05-24 17:04:30	Yoshi2	which I tried to do
2016-05-24 17:04:40	@PikFan	lol
2016-05-24 17:05:51	Yoshi2	the result was something that made the character go up if you moved towards the ladder, and go down if you moved away
2016-05-24 17:07:03	@PikFan	so basically, a stair
2016-05-24 17:07:17	Yoshi2	a vertical stair
2016-05-24 17:07:45	Yoshi2	I hijacked the movement script quite a bit for that to work
2016-05-24 17:10:04	Yoshi2	because gravity (implemented by the movement script) had to be disabled
2016-05-24 17:10:10	@PikFan	fun
2016-05-24 17:12:25	@PikFan	my friend will be joining us shortly
2016-05-24 17:12:41	@PikFan	she'll probably have questions
2016-05-24 17:12:55	-->	PrinceofHope (Mibbit@waax-229-297.shs.lane.edu) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-24 17:13:03	@PikFan	that's my friend
2016-05-24 17:13:09	PrinceofHope	Sup.
2016-05-24 17:13:11	Yoshi2	hi
2016-05-24 17:13:30	PrinceofHope	So you know a lot about programming?
2016-05-24 17:14:16	Yoshi2	i know a bit about programming
2016-05-24 17:14:53	@PikFan	well, he knows quite a bit about computer science, if that helps
2016-05-24 17:15:03	PrinceofHope	Sweet!
2016-05-24 17:15:32	PrinceofHope	That's awesome!
2016-05-24 17:15:44	Yoshi2	which involves quite a bit of maths
2016-05-24 17:16:30	Yoshi2	the computer science I study is not only about programming
2016-05-24 17:16:56	@PikFan	huh, I don't think you ever went into detail about that
2016-05-24 17:17:09	@PikFan	I know that you told me a little bit about it but I think that was it
2016-05-24 17:17:37	PrinceofHope	Haha, yeah. It probably wouldn't be my strong suit. I'm probably going to be better at designing.
2016-05-24 17:18:33	@PikFan	then you probably want to get a 3D rendering program so you can make models
2016-05-24 17:18:36	Yoshi2	for instance, at the moment I'm doing some maths logic, data security (as in safely transport data without having it garbled up) and databases
2016-05-24 17:18:45	@PikFan	Yoshi2: woah
2016-05-24 17:19:03	@PikFan	yeah, that sounds pretty intense
2016-05-24 17:19:16	PrinceofHope	Yeah, making models will be easier for me. That sounds intense.
2016-05-24 17:19:30	@PikFan	lol, we both used "intense"
2016-05-24 17:19:30	PrinceofHope	I admire your patience with such.
2016-05-24 17:20:21	Yoshi2	I'm not sure if "making models" is something that could be studied at the university I attend
2016-05-24 17:22:18	Yoshi2	if you only want to learn programming or only want to make models, that can likely be done without studying the entire computer stuff
2016-05-24 17:22:36	Yoshi2	*the entire computer science stuff
2016-05-24 17:24:01	PrinceofHope	Oh, I'm not really going to a university for this kind of stuff at least I don't think so. Yes, I want to create a game however, I may not have time for it. I'm going to become an art teacher but I also want to try going to a University in Seattle. If you get good marks there and in high school Nintendo will probably accept you for a job easier.
2016-05-24 17:24:39	@PikFan	like I mentioned to you IRL, Espyo took plenty of programming classes at his college
2016-05-24 17:24:50	@PikFan	so... it's up to you, really
2016-05-24 17:25:04	@PikFan	I SUPPOSE you could be self-taught but I'm not sure how far you can get

2016-05-24 17:25:21	Cheepy-Cheepy	PikFan
2016-05-24 17:25:21	PrinceofHope	I'm probably going to study stuff for computer science now anyways though as I have litterally nothing to do when I get home after school most days since I only work at an ice cream booth during the summer.
2016-05-24 17:25:55	@PikFan	ehhh, don't study computer science
2016-05-24 17:26:03	Cheepy-Cheepy	Ok
2016-05-24 17:26:12	Cheepy-Cheepy	Okuh
2016-05-24 17:26:15	@PikFan	if you want to design a Zelda game, you don't need all the extra stuff that comes with computer science
2016-05-24 17:26:26	PrinceofHope	I'm going to major in teaching and minor in computer science mot likely. However, my family wants me to be anurse.
2016-05-24 17:26:35	PrinceofHope	*a nurse.
2016-05-24 17:26:37	@PikFan	Cheepy-Cheepy: one of my IRL friends is on here and she's asking Yoshi2 a couple questions about programming/computer science
2016-05-24 17:26:43	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'm doing this on my school iPad and I keep tapping everywhere  😂
2016-05-24 17:26:55	@PikFan	the feels man
2016-05-24 17:27:03	Cheepy-Cheepy	🍔
2016-05-24 17:27:07	PrinceofHope	I still want to learn computer science though.
2016-05-24 17:27:10	@PikFan	oh, you might disconnect if you go into another tab, just warning you
2016-05-24 17:27:19	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'm not
2016-05-24 17:27:33	Cheepy-Cheepy	The only other tab I have open is the SCP Foundation
2016-05-24 17:27:50	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-24 17:28:04	@PikFan	well, I have an open period, and my friend, well... she's skipping :P
2016-05-24 17:28:16	Cheepy-Cheepy	I'm in my flex class 😂😂😂
2016-05-24 17:28:20	PrinceofHope	For good reasoning of course.
2016-05-24 17:28:21	@PikFan	oml
2016-05-24 17:29:11	Yoshi2	very naughty, skipping classes
2016-05-24 17:29:14	Cheepy-Cheepy	Just remembered I got homework to do

2016-05-24 17:30:01	@PikFan	don't worry about it :P
2016-05-24 17:31:07	@PikFan	by the way, we'll both have to be leaving soon
2016-05-24 17:31:11	@PikFan	class starts in 10 minutes for uss
2016-05-24 17:31:13	@PikFan	*us
2016-05-24 17:31:16	PrinceofHope	Besides, I already completed the assignment we were working on in that class anyways.
2016-05-24 17:31:27	Yoshi2	ah, that's cool
2016-05-24 17:32:15	@PikFan	PrinceofHope: wait, your art project, or your geography project?
2016-05-24 17:33:09	PrinceofHope	Haha, maybe. Teacher is going to kill me when I show up in his class tomorrow though. I've pulled a prank and made 1 too many sarcastic comments in that class. I'm also usually drawing as I've already taken this class before I just had a really evil teacher last year.
2016-05-24 17:33:20	PrinceofHope	My math project.
2016-05-24 17:33:47	PrinceofHope	Wright htes me.
2016-05-24 17:33:54	@PikFan	Wright is her math teacher
2016-05-24 17:34:01	Yoshi2	you have a math project?
2016-05-24 17:34:13	@PikFan	correction: had
2016-05-24 17:34:24	PrinceofHope	Yes. It was a group assignment but I did all the work.
2016-05-24 17:34:32	Yoshi2	I see
2016-05-24 17:35:58	PrinceofHope	Yup. We had to make a power point so I'm going to put in ending credits. All of which point to me and one other person who wasn't on their phone the whole time like the rest.
2016-05-24 17:38:22	PrinceofHope	I'm actually a good student I promise. I just get bored easily and i show that I'm bored.
2016-05-24 17:38:41	@PikFan	happens to the best of us
2016-05-24 17:38:42	PrinceofHope	It's not the smartest idea but it works.
2016-05-24 17:38:47	Yoshi2	heh
2016-05-24 17:39:19	PrinceofHope	I have to go. See ya.
2016-05-24 17:39:22	@PikFan	same here

2016-05-24 18:09:02	Marty2000	I'm back. Seems lots of things happened while I was gone. Going to check, I'm curious :p
2016-05-24 18:27:30	Yoshi2	lots of stuff happened indeed
2016-05-24 18:32:59	Marty2000	Yep, more things happened today than during the past months in the chatroom
2016-05-24 18:58:02	Yoshi2	if you want to have that happen more often you can try talking to me about homework or studying stuff or making games or whatever
2016-05-24 19:01:18	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-24 19:01:33	Marty2000	Right now, I'm playing, but I'll ask you stuff afterwards :p
2016-05-24 19:23:02	@J	[17:25:04] @PikFan I SUPPOSE you could be self-taught but I'm not sure how far you can get
2016-05-24 19:23:08	@J	oh, he left
2016-05-24 19:23:14	@J	was going to say it worked for me
2016-05-24 19:23:53	Yoshi2	I am mostly self-taught
2016-05-24 19:24:06	Yoshi2	had programming classes at school but I did far more at home than in school
2016-05-24 19:24:44	Yoshi2	once the ball gets rolling in terms of understanding how to write code, everything else is simple
2016-05-24 19:24:56	@J	but you learn it at university now, right?
2016-05-24 19:26:05	Yoshi2	I did learn some java/haskell/prolog and C in uni
2016-05-24 19:26:16	@J	yeah, I mean I was self-taught all the way up until I found a job in it
2016-05-24 19:26:25	Yoshi2	but by then I already had some years of python experience
2016-05-24 19:27:13	@J	I think it's not hard to get into computer science in higher education without having done it at school, even without any prior knowledge
2016-05-24 19:27:29	@J	they just want you to be good at maths/science
2016-05-24 19:27:39	Yoshi2	yep
2016-05-24 19:27:42	Yoshi2	lots of maths

2016-05-24 21:25:38	Klemen702	hi neo
2016-05-24 21:25:43	@Espyo	it's going along smoothly
2016-05-24 21:25:52	@Espyo	I might have hazards done by the end of June
2016-05-24 21:26:01	Neocraftz1553	and ships can now be rotated, right?
2016-05-24 21:26:17	@Espyo	well, I might have them done by the end of this month, but I'll still need to add pre-packaged hazards, enemies, etc.
2016-05-24 21:26:20	@Espyo	yeah, they can
2016-05-24 21:26:23	@Espyo	they actually work right now
2016-05-24 21:26:24	@Espyo	and smartly
2016-05-24 21:26:33	@Espyo	you can have ships that have a beam in front of them, behind them, below them, whatever you want
2016-05-24 21:26:36	@Espyo	and the engine just does it right
2016-05-24 21:26:43	Neocraftz1553	cool, to all of the above
2016-05-24 21:26:47	Neocraftz1553	below them?
2016-05-24 21:26:50	Neocraftz1553	Nice
2016-05-24 21:26:56	@Espyo	yeah, like the research pod or the SPERO
2016-05-24 21:26:58	Neocraftz1553	very nice
2016-05-24 21:27:07	Neocraftz1553	yeah, like the SPERO
2016-05-24 21:27:23	@Espyo	also, on the side, I'm working on making sector creation even easier
2016-05-24 21:27:31	@Espyo	instead of it spawning a square, and you having to mold it
2016-05-24 21:27:38	@Espyo	you'll be able to draw new sectors, one line at a time
2016-05-24 21:27:49	@Espyo	also you'll be able to create sectors that surround other sectors, if I can get it to work
2016-05-24 21:27:58	Neocraftz1553	Wow 
2016-05-24 21:28:04	@Espyo	which I hope I can, otherwise this entire "free draw" mechanic won't work...
2016-05-24 21:28:07	Neocraftz1553	World of Warcraft
2016-05-24 21:28:10	@Espyo	or it will work, but incredibly limited
2016-05-24 21:28:11	Neocraftz1553	jk
2016-05-24 21:28:23	Neocraftz1553	Thats cool
2016-05-24 21:28:29	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-24 21:28:30	Marty2000	Hi Neocraftz1553. Espyo : Yes... I don't exactly know how that happens, but I'm sure my explanation makes sense...
2016-05-24 21:28:44	Neocraftz1553	so you can basically draw sectors
2016-05-24 21:29:23	@Espyo	I thought I asked you about it before, and you basically said you had no idea
2016-05-24 21:29:28	@Espyo	so it basically is the way you describe it?
2016-05-24 21:29:35	@Espyo	Neocraftz1553: yeah

2016-05-24 22:01:21	@Espyo	AStyle is a tool that automatically styles your code a certain way
2016-05-24 22:01:41	@Espyo	like make all lines aligned, make sure they don't end in a pointless space, make all operations padded nicely with a space, etc.
2016-05-24 22:01:52	@Espyo	but between my work laptop and this laptop, I must've setup AStyle differently
2016-05-24 22:01:56	@Espyo	if you check the changes made on that commit
2016-05-24 22:02:07	@Espyo	you'll see how it's all just replacing empty lines with empty lines that have spaces
2016-05-24 22:02:22	@Espyo	one commit I did on my work laptop had it one way, this laptop has it another
2016-05-24 22:02:29	@Espyo	and before I realized, all of my files were following one style
2016-05-24 22:02:38	@Espyo	that commit is me fixing it to the other style, the one I really want
2016-05-24 22:02:54	@Espyo	I'm thinking of adding the ability to go under stuff one day
2016-05-24 22:02:57	@Espyo	but it'll be pretty hard
2016-05-24 22:03:02	@Espyo	but I have to try to implement it
2016-05-24 22:03:11	@Espyo	otherwise a LOT of manoeuvrability is lost...
2016-05-24 22:03:18	@Espyo	any bridge that goes over something becomes impossible
2016-05-24 22:03:30	@Espyo	and bridges ARE meant to go over something, so
2016-05-24 22:03:37	Neocraftz1553	wow
2016-05-24 22:03:41	Neocraftz1553	lots of text
2016-05-24 22:04:48	Neocraftz1553	true, lots of things are lost without going under things

2016-05-24 22:05:09	Neocraftz1553	it will be hard...

2016-05-24 22:06:14	Neocraftz1553	Maybe make the ground/bridge transparent when you go under it...

2016-05-24 22:16:47	@Espyo	these are the kind of details I wanted to know more of
2016-05-24 22:16:49	@Espyo	let me give it a try
2016-05-24 22:18:57	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-24 22:19:48	@Espyo	ok, now I remember what the most annoying part of Pikmin 1 is
2016-05-24 22:20:00	@Espyo	the Flint Bettle right after you leave the landing area at The Impact Site
2016-05-24 22:22:04	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-24 22:22:10	@Espyo	I just tried with a Pearly Clamclamp pearl
2016-05-24 22:22:15	@Espyo	and they're all leafs
2016-05-24 22:22:49	Marty2000	DId you leave at least one of them evolve into bud or flower beforehand?
2016-05-24 22:23:10	Marty2000	(leaving them buried, not using nectar)
2016-05-24 22:23:16	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-24 22:23:19	@Espyo	I also didn't pluck it
2016-05-24 22:23:19	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-24 22:23:28	@Espyo	three Blues were carrying the pearl back
2016-05-24 22:23:32	@Espyo	one flower seed
2016-05-24 22:23:39	@Espyo	the Onion takes the pearl, ejects 50 leaves
2016-05-24 22:23:54	@Espyo	maybe it's an NPC! thing?
2016-05-24 22:23:58	Marty2000	Anyway, once landing, they're all leaves
2016-05-24 22:24:07	@Espyo	huh?
2016-05-24 22:24:10	@Espyo	what do you mean?
2016-05-24 22:24:22	Marty2000	Wait, playing Splatoon, be right back in 5 minutes
2016-05-24 22:24:23	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-05-24 22:24:26	@Espyo	it's all right
2016-05-24 22:24:44	@Espyo	do you mean that when the Onion ejects the seeds, they're leafs, buds, or flowers, but when they land and turn into a Pikmin, they're always leaf?
2016-05-24 22:24:51	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-24 22:25:03	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-24 22:25:08	@Espyo	sounds like a glitch to me, then
2016-05-24 22:25:15	@Espyo	anyway, I'll try NPC!
2016-05-24 22:25:41	Marty2000	It's the same, normally
2016-05-24 22:25:46	Marty2000	[[Pikmin family]]
2016-05-24 22:25:47	Testyo	"Pikmin_family" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_family
2016-05-24 22:26:17	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/e/e0/Pikmin_seed_%28bud%29.png So yeah, that seed, when landing, will still be a leaf
2016-05-24 22:26:38	Marty2000	It's just a bud/flower when ejected ;)
2016-05-24 22:27:03	@Espyo	WHAT?
2016-05-24 22:27:12	@Espyo	PIKMIN DON'T CHASE AFTER THE IRIDESCENT FLINT BEETLE IN NPC!P?
2016-05-24 22:27:17	@Espyo	oh blessed developers
2016-05-24 22:27:19	Marty2000	No
2016-05-24 22:27:39	@Espyo	you say it's the same... then how come I couldn't get it to happen?
2016-05-24 22:27:41	@Espyo	is it rare?
2016-05-24 22:27:57	Marty2000	No, it's different in NPC
2016-05-24 22:28:11	Marty2000	(for the Iridescent Flint Bettle)
2016-05-24 22:28:24	Marty2000	They don't chase after it
2016-05-24 22:29:08	@Espyo	yeah, but I'm talking about the seed glitch
2016-05-24 22:29:28	@Espyo	the Beetle thing was just a side comment I made
2016-05-24 22:29:29	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-24 22:30:17	@Espyo	tried in NPC!, once again, they are all leafs...
2016-05-24 22:30:46	Marty2000	Did one of them evolve in bud/leaf beforehand?
2016-05-24 22:30:58	Marty2000	(staying buried)
2016-05-24 22:31:05	@Espyo	exact same scenario as before, on the GameCube
2016-05-24 22:31:18	@Espyo	left one buried Pikmin, let it grew, delivered the pearl
2016-05-24 22:31:22	Marty2000	Because my screenshots are from NPC...*
2016-05-24 22:31:23	@Espyo	all the seeds that showered were leafs
2016-05-24 22:31:37	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-24 22:32:06	@Espyo	can you give me the same steps you took to get that to happen?
2016-05-24 22:32:22	Marty2000	Day 1
2016-05-24 22:32:38	Marty2000	First seed ejected, left it evolve into bud, plucked it, and made some Pikmin
2016-05-24 22:32:44	Marty2000	Some of the seeds were bud
2016-05-24 22:32:49	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-24 22:32:59	Marty2000	Maybe it depends on the Pikmin that brought the pellet...
2016-05-24 22:33:01	@Espyo	how many? one out of every three, or more like one out of every a million?
2016-05-24 22:33:35	Marty2000	4
2016-05-24 22:34:07	Marty2000	Wait, I have to finish my match, then I'll be able to talk
2016-05-24 22:34:18	@Espyo	okay
2016-05-24 22:36:01	Marty2000	Okay, finished. So, I have a new theory...
2016-05-24 22:36:22	Marty2000	Maybe it depends on the Pikmin that allowed the Onion to make seeds...
2016-05-24 22:36:26	Marty2000	FOr instance...
2016-05-24 22:36:43	Marty2000	If a bud Pikmin brings a pellet to its Onion, maybe the seeds will have buds
2016-05-24 22:37:04	Marty2000	If you could try, that'd be great
2016-05-24 22:37:07	@Espyo	didn't seem to be the case
2016-05-24 22:37:13	@Espyo	on the GC, I brought it back with all flowers
2016-05-24 22:37:22	@Espyo	and on the Wii, I THINK the carriers were two leafs and one bud
2016-05-24 22:37:37	Marty2000	I see... maybe random then
2016-05-24 22:37:57	@Espyo	well, if it's random, how come you can get it reliably, but me, after spawning 100 Pikmin, can't?
2016-05-24 22:38:01	@Espyo	so weird...
2016-05-24 22:38:11	Marty2000	I will download an iso of P1 soon, since I can't launch my game...
2016-05-24 22:38:29	@Espyo	that really sucks
2016-05-24 22:38:32	Marty2000	I don't know...
2016-05-24 22:39:01	@Espyo	I'd love to get to the bottom of this mystery
2016-05-24 22:39:10	@Espyo	see, we don't even have to chase the next mystery, it just comes natural :D
2016-05-24 22:39:40	Marty2000	He he, one more "Did you know"... it would be surprising if it were random, after our discovery about the leaders
2016-05-24 22:40:05	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-24 22:40:09	Marty2000	Oh, also...
2016-05-24 22:40:23	Marty2000	Maybe you've seen that on my userpage... http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty#Glitches
2016-05-24 22:40:29	@Espyo	to me, it actually smells like a very similar story to the leaders thing
2016-05-24 22:40:38	@Espyo	if the bud or flower remained on the Pikmin, that'd be a mechanic
2016-05-24 22:40:43	@Espyo	but since it doesn't...
2016-05-24 22:40:58	@Espyo	oh, I saw that a long time ago
2016-05-24 22:41:07	@Espyo	but I didn't give it much thought, since you'd eventually take a closer look at it
2016-05-24 22:41:16	Marty2000	Hmm... I'll have time tomorrow, so I'll try to find P1 and make experiments
2016-05-24 22:41:17	@Espyo	at least, I assumed, since you put it on your user page
2016-05-24 22:41:22	@Espyo	nice
2016-05-24 22:41:24	@Espyo	also, one thing
2016-05-24 22:41:39	@Espyo	but don't you want to write down some of your notes and todos on a document on your computer?
2016-05-24 22:41:41	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-05-24 22:42:01	@Espyo	mostly because when you add or remove something, you have to call Pikipedia's pages, and fill up the recent changes
2016-05-24 22:42:08	@Espyo	I mean, it's not that big of a deal
2016-05-24 22:42:18	@Espyo	but having a text file on your desktop can be so much more convenient
2016-05-24 22:42:29	@Espyo	and a bit friendlier with the recent changes
2016-05-24 22:42:40	Marty2000	Oh, I see. Sorry for that, I'll move them if it's better ;)
2016-05-24 22:42:44	@Espyo	if you can't, for some reason, like you using several different computers and want a place to have the notes all in one place
2016-05-24 22:42:45	@Espyo	that's fine
2016-05-24 22:42:50	@Espyo	but if not, it might be better for everyone
2016-05-24 22:42:54	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-24 22:43:12	@Espyo	I guess stuff like that glitch's reproduction steps can stay
2016-05-24 22:43:15	@Espyo	since other users can read and try
2016-05-24 22:43:20	@Espyo	but stuff like a list of treasure pages that need images...
2016-05-24 22:43:24	@Espyo	you update that several times a day
2016-05-24 22:43:36	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-24 22:43:49	@Espyo	and I bet it's even a strain to you, having to go browse to your user page, wait for it to load, click edit, wait for it to load, change and press submit, wait for it to load

2016-05-25 09:33:45	Marty2000	I was thinking of playing without using the squid form
2016-05-25 09:34:14	Yoshi2	the "searching for a battle to join" weapon
2016-05-25 09:34:39	Marty2000	That one can keep people away easily, it's lie cheats
2016-05-25 09:34:41	Marty2000	like*
2016-05-25 09:36:18	Yoshi2	how about the classic 420noscopeXXXX
2016-05-25 09:36:39	Yoshi2	or maybe not, I think rotation isn't that quick
2016-05-25 09:36:42	Gamefreak75	you gotta use the carbon roller
2016-05-25 09:36:53	Marty2000	Hi Gamefreak75, and okay ;)
2016-05-25 09:36:56	Marty2000	I'll use it, then
2016-05-25 09:37:06	Gamefreak75	hi
2016-05-25 09:37:12	Yoshi2	hm yes, roller seems like a good idea
2016-05-25 09:38:29	Marty2000	Starting to record!
2016-05-25 09:46:31	Marty2000	First match: my team lost. Points = 835 and ratio = 4/2
2016-05-25 09:46:52	Marty2000	That weapon is fun, even though I prefer the one with seekers
2016-05-25 09:50:42	Marty2000	Second match, we lost too...
2016-05-25 09:50:49	Marty2000	I'll upload
2016-05-25 09:53:20	Marty2000	I'll try to play without using the squid form :p I feel it's going to be "fun", he he
2016-05-25 09:55:14	Marty2000	Lol... that's horrible
2016-05-25 09:58:06	Marty2000	Ok, I've used the Splattershort Jr without using the squid form, and I just can't kill anybody. I'll try with a charger...
2016-05-25 10:03:00	Marty2000	Lol, I killed somebody
2016-05-25 10:03:02	Marty2000	What a miracle

2016-05-25 10:12:44	Marty2000	He he, using the E-litre 3K Scope was a good idea: my ratio is 6/3
2016-05-25 10:12:57	Marty2000	Well, I'll upload it later... what now?

2016-05-25 13:30:43	Yoshi2	how about this mystery:
2016-05-25 13:30:54	Yoshi2	why does pikmin 2 have a toy tank in the files
2016-05-25 13:42:39	Marty2000	For the President. He's supposed to be a tyrant, so he can threaten Olimar and Louie if their work is bad... ;)
2016-05-25 13:42:50	Marty2000	thanks to that tank
2016-05-25 13:43:08	Marty2000	But since the game can be played by little children, Nintendo removed the tank.
2016-05-25 14:03:04	Marty2000	Okay, Yoshi2, I'm going to try your challenge on Splatoon (2 matches)
2016-05-25 14:03:14	Yoshi2	good luck
2016-05-25 14:03:26	Marty2000	Thanks, but I think it'll be actually easy ;)
2016-05-25 14:04:25	Marty2000	Hmm, any weapon or want me to use a specific one?
2016-05-25 14:04:31	Marty2000	Like... a bamboozler :p
2016-05-25 14:04:46	Marty2000	But since I won't use the main weapon...
2016-05-25 14:04:51	Marty2000	It's useless
2016-05-25 14:05:00	Marty2000	So I can take the one I want.
2016-05-25 14:05:41	Marty2000	I feel bad for my future teammates, he he :/
2016-05-25 14:09:45	Marty2000	I win my first match

2016-05-25 14:13:49	Marty2000	31p :)
2016-05-25 14:14:01	Marty2000	What now? 
2016-05-25 14:15:42	Yoshi2	something with those pyramid-shaped grenades maybe?
2016-05-25 14:17:00	Marty2000	Covering turf with them? I see
2016-05-25 14:17:05	Marty2000	It will be easier
2016-05-25 14:17:18	Marty2000	Especially if I use the Bomb rush special
2016-05-25 14:17:56	Marty2000	Trying
2016-05-25 14:21:46	Marty2000	I got 667p

2016-05-25 17:18:40	@PikFan	okay, so
2016-05-25 17:18:50	@PikFan	I don't think I should learn C#
2016-05-25 17:19:11	Yoshi2	how so?
2016-05-25 17:19:12	@PikFan	because although it's the language in Unity3D, C# is pretty different from C++, as I learned
2016-05-25 17:19:25	@PikFan	and C++ is probably more useful than C#
2016-05-25 17:19:44	@PikFan	C++ is also the language of Unreal Engine
2016-05-25 17:19:54	Yoshi2	I'm pretty sure they are both useful
2016-05-25 17:20:05	@PikFan	and I've seen some pretty awesome remasters made in Unreal Engine

2016-05-25 17:20:19	Yoshi2	if you don't half-ass it, you won't regret learning either of the languages
2016-05-25 17:20:26	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-25 17:20:34	@PikFan	doesn't Allegro use C++?
2016-05-25 17:20:50	Yoshi2	although C++ probably allows for better performance
2016-05-25 17:20:55	@PikFan	and I know that the fangame engine was built in Allegro
2016-05-25 17:20:57	Yoshi2	no idea about allegro, might be
2016-05-25 17:21:02	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-25 17:22:06	@PikFan	http://liballeg.org/
2016-05-25 17:22:12	@PikFan	>User-friendly, intuitive C API usable from C++ and many other languages
2016-05-25 17:22:17	@PikFan	C++, yup
2016-05-25 17:22:22	@PikFan	so maybe Espyo can help me learn it
2016-05-25 17:23:49	Yoshi2	I can only help to some extent because I've done C, not C++
2016-05-25 17:23:55	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-25 17:24:18	@PikFan	since I'm an absolute beginner, you should be able to help me get off the ground
2016-05-25 17:25:02	@PikFan	...I feel excited about learning programming :D
2016-05-25 17:25:08	Yoshi2	quite possible
2016-05-25 17:25:23	Yoshi2	and the stuff I don't know I can probably try to look up
2016-05-25 17:27:01	Yoshi2	C++ counts as a super set of C so it shouldn't be THAT bad
2016-05-25 17:27:24	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-25 17:27:39	@PikFan	I probably shouldn't get ahead of myself, though
2016-05-25 17:27:59	@PikFan	I probably won't be creating a whole scene within months
2016-05-25 17:28:03	@PikFan	or even years
2016-05-25 17:28:10	Yoshi2	yeah, if you haven't done programming before then you want to start small
2016-05-25 17:28:17	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-25 17:28:42	@PikFan	alright, so
2016-05-25 17:28:50	@PikFan	where will I write code?
2016-05-25 17:28:57	Yoshi2	on your
2016-05-25 17:28:59	Yoshi2	computer
2016-05-25 17:29:02	Yoshi2	(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ 
2016-05-25 17:29:12	@PikFan	I meant a program :|
2016-05-25 17:29:25	@PikFan	do I write it on a complier?
2016-05-25 17:29:48	Yoshi2	you will need two things: a text editor, and a compiler
2016-05-25 17:30:25	Yoshi2	some programs have both a text editor and a compiler (or at least can be set up with a compiler) and that's what you call an IDE (integrated development environment)
2016-05-25 17:30:46	@PikFan	okay
2016-05-25 17:31:08	@PikFan	if I don't use an IDE, would I want to use Notepad++ as my text editor?
2016-05-25 17:31:21	Yoshi2	you can use notepad++ as your text editor
2016-05-25 17:31:26	@PikFan	okay
2016-05-25 17:33:01	@PikFan	so while you're writing the code, the compiler will... well, compile the code, right?
2016-05-25 17:33:13	@PikFan	(if you're using an IDE)
2016-05-25 17:33:30	Yoshi2	the compiler won't do anything unless you tell it to do something
2016-05-25 17:33:34	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-25 17:33:47	@PikFan	yeah, that makes sense
2016-05-25 17:34:06	@PikFan	so say you've got a long text that codes for some kind of scene
2016-05-25 17:34:24	@PikFan	when you tell it to compile, where will the result be shown?
2016-05-25 17:36:35	Yoshi2	no idea about scenes or how Unreal does it, I can only talk about what happens when you compile a regular application
2016-05-25 17:36:56	@PikFan	hmm, alright
2016-05-25 17:37:17	Yoshi2	as you write in C++, your source code will have the file ending ".cpp"
2016-05-25 17:37:28	@PikFan	okay
2016-05-25 17:37:55	@PikFan	but I should probably be learning how to actually code in the first place
2016-05-25 17:38:05	Yoshi2	when writing a regular program, e.g. something that, when executed, prints "Hello World!" to the screen, your source code has to have a main function
2016-05-25 17:38:19	Yoshi2	you compile the source code and on windows you will receive an ".exe" file
2016-05-25 17:38:42	@PikFan	right
2016-05-25 17:38:48	Yoshi2	you execute that exe file and it will run the main function and you will receive that output on your screen
2016-05-25 17:39:11	@PikFan	mhm
2016-05-25 17:40:08	Yoshi2	writing code for unreal probably works different than that, but I've never done stuff in Unreal so I can't say how it works there
2016-05-25 17:40:35	Yoshi2	you probably want to do some programming independent from unreal anyway first
2016-05-25 17:40:40	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-25 17:40:47	@PikFan	http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/
2016-05-25 17:41:02	@PikFan	I'm already getting confused at line 2
2016-05-25 17:41:23	@PikFan	but... it's just basically some kind of instruction?
2016-05-25 17:42:03	Yoshi2	it's an instruction that tells the compiler that you want to use functions from that particular library
2016-05-25 17:42:26	@PikFan	hold up
2016-05-25 17:42:34	@PikFan	can you explain to me what a library is?
2016-05-25 17:42:39	Yoshi2	yes
2016-05-25 17:42:43	Yoshi2	ok
2016-05-25 17:42:57	-->	Marty2000 (Mibbit@eexm-4-1959-50.w75-979.abo.wanadoo.fr) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-25 17:43:03	@PikFan	hi Marty2000
2016-05-25 17:43:03	Yoshi2	so imagine you write lots of cool functions that do a lot of awesome stuff
2016-05-25 17:43:10	@PikFan	mhm
2016-05-25 17:43:13	Marty2000	Hi PikFan
2016-05-25 17:43:18	Yoshi2	all those functions are in file1
2016-05-25 17:43:19	Yoshi2	hi marty
2016-05-25 17:43:27	Marty2000	Hi again Yoshi2 :)
2016-05-25 17:43:43	Yoshi2	now you write a second file in which you want to use functions that you wrote in file1
2016-05-25 17:43:58	@PikFan	okay
2016-05-25 17:44:06	Yoshi2	you have the following options: either you copy the entire code from file1 into file2
2016-05-25 17:44:25	Yoshi2	or you tell the compiler that you want to use the functions that were defined in file1
2016-05-25 17:44:32	Yoshi2	so file1 acts as a library
2016-05-25 17:45:03	Yoshi2	in which the books are functions, for example
2016-05-25 17:45:10	@PikFan	right, right
2016-05-25 17:45:26	@PikFan	and they get "checked out", so to speak
2016-05-25 17:46:00	@PikFan	...except that they don't get returned, I imagine :P
2016-05-25 17:46:10	@PikFan	but anyway, I get it
2016-05-25 17:46:19	Yoshi2	they don#t have to be returned because there is enough for everybody :P
2016-05-25 17:46:26	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-25 17:46:30	Yoshi2	libraries in programming are a way to avoid writing code that you wrote once before again
2016-05-25 17:46:49	@PikFan	sounds pretty convenient
2016-05-25 17:48:16	Yoshi2	when you see #include <iostream>, that's a standard library being used which comes with the compiler/system (I don#t know the specifics of that)
2016-05-25 17:49:12	@PikFan	alright
2016-05-25 17:49:30	@PikFan	<iostream> could be replaced with another library, right?
2016-05-25 17:49:34	Yoshi2	a library name in <> is a standard lib
2016-05-25 17:49:42	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-25 17:50:15	Yoshi2	ah, the page explains the lines too
2016-05-25 17:50:50	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-25 17:50:56	@PikFan	I've got it open right now
2016-05-25 17:51:16	Yoshi2	I have to go now, gotta go groceries shopping
2016-05-25 17:51:21	@PikFan	oh, okay
2016-05-25 17:51:26	@PikFan	thanks for the help
2016-05-25 17:51:28	@PikFan	see ya

2016-05-25 18:58:53	@Espyo	that's a great idea
2016-05-25 18:58:56	@Espyo	and a horrible idea
2016-05-25 19:00:51	Klemen702	it's a good thing to spam if you are  bored
2016-05-25 19:00:54	Klemen702	testyo
2016-05-25 19:00:54	Testyo	right typed "I am" twice
2016-05-25 19:01:41	@Espyo	yeah, but spam is still spam
2016-05-25 19:01:49	@Espyo	but remember you have the #Testyo channel for all your shitposting needs
2016-05-25 19:01:49	Testyo	and when you write the entire thing to a file, it goes through the MIDIEvents and then writes the data in a White Onion could only be energized with White Pikmin?
2016-05-25 19:04:09	Yoshi2	Espyo: earlier I explained to him what libraries are
2016-05-25 19:06:07	@Espyo	oh no
2016-05-25 19:06:27	Klemen702	testyo define library
2016-05-25 19:06:27	Testyo	I don't know what library means!
2016-05-25 19:06:31	Yoshi2	so yes, it will be a fun ride :|
2016-05-25 19:06:31	Klemen702	liar!
2016-05-25 19:34:02	Marty2000	Ok, Espyo, I'll explain you how the glitch about the seeds work
2016-05-25 19:34:12	Marty2000	You can try with Dolphin to confirm what I say, if you want to
2016-05-25 19:36:03	@Espyo	I'm all ears!
2016-05-25 19:36:07	@Espyo	I will in a bit
2016-05-25 19:36:14	@Espyo	I'm finishing a video, 5 more minutes
2016-05-25 19:36:20	@Espyo	so if you want to wait till then, I can follow along
2016-05-25 19:36:42	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 19:36:47	Yoshi2	ok, time to record some wii gameplay with framedump, not looking forward to it
2016-05-25 19:37:50	@Espyo	RIP

2016-05-25 19:58:28	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 19:58:36	Marty2000	I'll use screenshots too to guide you
2016-05-25 19:58:55	Marty2000	Just keep in mind that my Red Pikmin are black and my Blues are white (hacks)
2016-05-25 19:59:00	Marty2000	So...
2016-05-25 19:59:05	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-25 19:59:13	@Espyo	but you DID manage to get this behavior without hacks too, right?
2016-05-25 19:59:13	Marty2000	Tell me when you're on day 1, before discovering the red Onion
2016-05-25 19:59:18	Marty2000	Oh, yes
2016-05-25 19:59:22	@Espyo	good
2016-05-25 19:59:28	@Espyo	btw, I'll be doing this on the GameCube version
2016-05-25 19:59:38	Marty2000	I did on the Gamecube version too ;)
2016-05-25 19:59:43	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-25 19:59:47	@Espyo	in that case, I'll use the American version
2016-05-25 19:59:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 19:59:53	@Espyo	so if I can't get it to happen...maybe it could be a regional difference
2016-05-25 20:00:25	@Espyo	what the hell is this save file...
2016-05-25 20:00:31	@Espyo	day 27 with 15 parts
2016-05-25 20:00:36	@Espyo	day 22 with 18 parts
2016-05-25 20:00:40	Marty2000	I doubt it, honestly. It's somehow similar to how that leader thing works
2016-05-25 20:00:40	@Espyo	day 20 with 23 parts
2016-05-25 20:00:46	Marty2000	(not exactly, though)
2016-05-25 20:00:48	@Espyo	I got it off the internet ages ago...but it's a really weird save
2016-05-25 20:01:09	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-25 20:01:15	@Espyo	ok, controlling Olimar on day 1
2016-05-25 20:01:37	Marty2000	Good. Discover the red Onion : the seed will have a leaf when ejected, normally
2016-05-25 20:02:00	@Espyo	yeah, leaf
2016-05-25 20:02:07	@Espyo	(good, otherwise that'd be a new mystery in and of itself)
2016-05-25 20:02:27	Marty2000	Wait for it to be a bud now
2016-05-25 20:02:32	Marty2000	to be on bud stage*
2016-05-25 20:02:33	@Espyo	oops, I got close to it
2016-05-25 20:02:35	@Espyo	but didn't pluck it
2016-05-25 20:02:42	Marty2000	That's not a problem
2016-05-25 20:02:45	@Espyo	okay
2016-05-25 20:02:46	Marty2000	As long as it's not plucked
2016-05-25 20:02:57	@Espyo	bud
2016-05-25 20:03:10	Marty2000	Already?Okay, pluck it
2016-05-25 20:03:15	@Espyo	fast-forwarding
2016-05-25 20:03:19	Marty2000	Ah, I see
2016-05-25 20:03:23	@Espyo	woah
2016-05-25 20:03:28	@Espyo	I can get speeds of 1000+%
2016-05-25 20:03:30	@Espyo	so ten times faster
2016-05-25 20:03:33	@Espyo	no wonder that was quick
2016-05-25 20:03:35	Marty2000	He he
2016-05-25 20:03:46	Marty2000	Now, retrieve a pellet: one seed will be a bud, the other will be a leaf
2016-05-25 20:04:14	Marty2000	(only when ejected, remember)
2016-05-25 20:04:25	Marty2000	(all are leaves when landing)
2016-05-25 20:04:46	@Espyo	also, off-topic, but I didn't realize the game was stereo
2016-05-25 20:04:53	@Espyo	like, I know it's stereo
2016-05-25 20:04:57	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-25 20:05:01	@Espyo	but the objects compared to the camera play their sounds more to the left or right
2016-05-25 20:05:09	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-25 20:05:13	@Espyo	I had one of my headphone...things a bit off my ear
2016-05-25 20:05:15	@Espyo	and I could tell the difference
2016-05-25 20:05:16	@Espyo	neat
2016-05-25 20:05:23	@Espyo	oh!
2016-05-25 20:05:25	@Espyo	one of them really is a bud
2016-05-25 20:05:28	@Espyo	well I'll be

2016-05-25 20:05:41	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-25 20:06:03	Marty2000	Okay, now, wait for a Pikmin to be on the bud stage, pluck it, and pluck the other on its flower stage
2016-05-25 20:06:51	@Espyo	got two buds, one flower
2016-05-25 20:07:14	Marty2000	Okay, take whatever Pikmin you want, and retrieve a pellet: one seed will be a flower, and the other will be a bud
2016-05-25 20:07:38	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-25 20:08:14	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-25 20:08:28	Marty2000	He he, so far so good... If it's not clear enough, that oddity happens depending on the number of Pikmin on a particular stage you plucked before retrieving a pellet
2016-05-25 20:08:46	Marty2000	So if you produce 5 Pikmin, pluck two buds and 3 flowers
2016-05-25 20:08:49	@Espyo	seems that way, yeah...
2016-05-25 20:09:00	Marty2000	the next seeds will be 2 buds, 3 flowers, and the rest are leaves
2016-05-25 20:09:06	@Espyo	right
2016-05-25 20:09:09	Marty2000	It works with Candypop Buds
2016-05-25 20:09:18	Marty2000	And it's the same thing for all Onions
2016-05-25 20:09:37	Marty2000	If you pluck a bud Red Pikmin, you can have a bud Blue Pikmin seed
2016-05-25 20:09:45	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/21/1464201139-12.jpg Proven by this screenshot
2016-05-25 20:09:59	@Espyo	hm, not quite...
2016-05-25 20:10:03	@Espyo	I recovered a 5-pellet
2016-05-25 20:10:12	@Espyo	I've got two flowers, three buds
2016-05-25 20:10:15	@Espyo	as my army
2016-05-25 20:10:23	@Espyo	and the seeds that came out have one bud, one flower, and three leafs
2016-05-25 20:10:37	Marty2000	Did you pluck all the Pikmin?
2016-05-25 20:10:54	Marty2000	Otherwise it doesn't work
2016-05-25 20:11:05	@Espyo	before I got the five pellet? yeah
2016-05-25 20:11:44	Marty2000	Were you sure you had 2 buds and 3 flowers? Or was it different?
2016-05-25 20:11:49	Marty2000	Otherwise, I can just cry
2016-05-25 20:11:55	Marty2000	Because it's constant for me
2016-05-25 20:11:59	Marty2000	But not for you :/
2016-05-25 20:12:06	@Espyo	 3 buds, 2 flowers on my group
2016-05-25 20:12:16	Marty2000	Ah, but it does not depend on your group
2016-05-25 20:12:23	Marty2000	It depends on the Pikmin you've just plucked
2016-05-25 20:12:33	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-25 20:12:42	@Espyo	ok, so for my first Pikmin, I plucked it when it was a bud
2016-05-25 20:12:58	@Espyo	the Onion ejected 2 and 3
2016-05-25 20:13:00	@Espyo	plucked the 2nd when it was a bud, the 3rd when it was a flower
2016-05-25 20:13:13	@Espyo	the Onion ejected 4 and 5, plucked the 4th on bud, plucked the 5th on flower
2016-05-25 20:13:18	Marty2000	"and the seeds that came out have one bud, one flower, and three leafs" That means the last Pikmin that were plucked were 3 leaves, one bud, one flower
2016-05-25 20:13:34	@Espyo	nope, I very definitely did not pluck a single leaf Pikmin
2016-05-25 20:13:42	Marty2000	Ah, I understood
2016-05-25 20:14:17	Marty2000	It's because once you go past the number of seed that match the stage of the Pikmin you plucked
2016-05-25 20:14:19	Marty2000	All are leaves
2016-05-25 20:14:29	Marty2000	I mean, if you plucked one bud
2016-05-25 20:14:50	Marty2000	You will have a seed with a bud, and the rest will be leaves, always leaves, until you plcuk a bud/flower.
2016-05-25 20:14:50	@Espyo	hm, not quite sure I follow
2016-05-25 20:15:11	@Espyo	then how did I get a leaf and a flower for seeds 4 and 5?
2016-05-25 20:15:24	Marty2000	You plucked a flower
2016-05-25 20:15:40	Marty2000	If you plucked 5 bud Pikmin and 6 flower Pikmin
2016-05-25 20:15:55	@Espyo	in a row?
2016-05-25 20:16:00	Marty2000	And then you retrieved something that gives you... hmm... 20 Pikmin
2016-05-25 20:16:24	Marty2000	5 seeds will be on bud stage, 6 will be on flower stage, and the rest will be leaves
2016-05-25 20:16:41	Marty2000	And if you continue bringing corpses, the new seeds will also be leaves
2016-05-25 20:16:59	Marty2000	Until you pluck a bud or flower Pikmin
2016-05-25 20:19:11	Marty2000	To sum up, each time you pluck a bud or flower Pikmin, a seed of the corresponding type will be ejected next time you bring corpses back to an Onion
2016-05-25 20:19:24	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-25 20:19:44	@Espyo	okay, I guess
2016-05-25 20:19:47	@Espyo	but
2016-05-25 20:19:50	@Espyo	does this only happen on day 1?
2016-05-25 20:19:58	Marty2000	No, every day
2016-05-25 20:20:04	Marty2000	But it doesn't carry over day, though
2016-05-25 20:20:13	Marty2000	When a new day begins, it's reset to leaf
2016-05-25 20:20:41	@Espyo	right
2016-05-25 20:21:03	@Espyo	maybe I said I couldn't get it to happen because I didn't find the bud in the middle of 50 leafs, with the Pearly Clamclamp
2016-05-25 20:21:11	Marty2000	I hope you could understand it... Sorry if it's unclear
2016-05-25 20:21:17	@Espyo	I think I've got it
2016-05-25 20:21:24	Marty2000	Good then
2016-05-25 20:21:25	@Espyo	it's just that this kind of subject is really hard to understand if you dive right in
2016-05-25 20:21:30	@Espyo	but if you understand it, it's easy
2016-05-25 20:21:36	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-25 20:22:17	@Espyo	does it carry over between Pikmin types?
2016-05-25 20:22:24	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-25 20:22:27	@Espyo	cool
2016-05-25 20:22:33	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/21/1464201139-11.jpg
2016-05-25 20:22:38	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/21/1464201139-12.jpg
2016-05-25 20:22:46	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-25 20:23:07	Marty2000	Once the bud Red Pikmin got plucked
2016-05-25 20:23:13	Marty2000	I could get the bud Blue seed
2016-05-25 20:24:45	@Espyo	oh, I could've tested with this Swooping Snitchbug
2016-05-25 20:24:49	@Espyo	but I killed it :|
2016-05-25 20:24:57	Marty2000	Ha ha
2016-05-25 20:25:02	Marty2000	It would be interesting yeah
2016-05-25 20:25:25	Marty2000	Look how this works with Candypop Buds too:
2016-05-25 20:25:29	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/21/1464201157-17.jpg
2016-05-25 20:25:34	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/21/1464201157-18.jpg
2016-05-25 20:25:58	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-25 20:26:00	@Espyo	looks like it might work
2016-05-25 20:26:08	@Espyo	I actually plucked some leaf Pikmin from the Snitchbug
2016-05-25 20:26:16	@Espyo	I delivered something to the Onion
2016-05-25 20:26:18	@Espyo	and got two leafs
2016-05-25 20:26:45	Marty2000	Oh yeah, but you should try with bud or flower, because as I told you, the default seeds are leaves
2016-05-25 20:26:53	@Espyo	and NOW I get four buds
2016-05-25 20:27:20	@Espyo	and the next one was leaf
2016-05-25 20:27:23	@Espyo	ok, it's matching up
2016-05-25 20:27:29	@Espyo	but I will try with a Snitchbug anyway
2016-05-25 20:28:04	Marty2000	It always match the number of bud and flower pikmin, and once there is no more of those types, the seeds will be leaves.
2016-05-25 20:28:05	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 20:28:32	@Espyo	oh?
2016-05-25 20:28:37	@Espyo	it tossed a Pikmin against the Onion
2016-05-25 20:28:41	@Espyo	it canceled the burial process
2016-05-25 20:28:45	@Espyo	the Pikmin just landed harmlessly
2016-05-25 20:29:13	Marty2000	Yes, it can't get buried when encountering an obstacle
2016-05-25 20:29:34	@Espyo	we need to add that
2016-05-25 20:29:37	@Espyo	what about the other games?
2016-05-25 20:30:05	Marty2000	I dont know, that enemy is not around the Onions in P2/P3
2016-05-25 20:30:11	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-25 20:30:15	@Espyo	well, you did say "obstacle"
2016-05-25 20:30:17	@Espyo	not Onion specifically
2016-05-25 20:30:46	Marty2000	Yes, but I hardly imagine it throwing a Pikmin against a wall
2016-05-25 20:30:50	@Espyo	ok, Snitchbugs work too for this
2016-05-25 20:30:56	@Espyo	looks like the source of burial doesn't matter
2016-05-25 20:30:59	@Espyo	what matters is if you pluck it
2016-05-25 20:31:04	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-25 20:31:07	@Espyo	also this save file had some buried Pikmin already on the area
2016-05-25 20:31:09	@Espyo	I'll try those too
2016-05-25 20:31:16	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 20:32:28	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-25 20:32:30	@Espyo	they count as well
2016-05-25 20:32:59	Marty2000	He he, another mystery got solved, I suppose
2016-05-25 20:33:28	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-25 20:33:33	Marty2000	I do think it's a glitch, though
2016-05-25 20:33:36	@Espyo	I think I can figure out why it works the way it does
2016-05-25 20:33:41	@Espyo	oh, I think it really is a glitch
2016-05-25 20:34:01	Marty2000	Ah, great if you can figure it out :)
2016-05-25 20:36:49	@Espyo	the order's not reversed, is it?
2016-05-25 20:37:00	@Espyo	like, pluck a bud, pluck a flower, get a flower seed, get a bud seed
2016-05-25 20:37:41	Marty2000	Playing, Rsponding soon
2016-05-25 20:37:46	@Espyo	ok
2016-05-25 20:37:48	@Espyo	I'll check, anyway
2016-05-25 20:37:48	Marty2000	So
2016-05-25 20:38:00	Marty2000	It's like when you withdraw Pikmin
2016-05-25 20:38:10	Marty2000	The order is always flower===bud===leaf
2016-05-25 20:40:13	@Espyo	it follows the same order as you pluck them, yes
2016-05-25 20:40:15	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-05-25 20:40:19	@Espyo	this puts a spanner on my idea
2016-05-25 20:40:24	@Espyo	I can just put this out of the way, though:
2016-05-25 20:40:31	@Espyo	the buried Pikmin and the seed are the same object
2016-05-25 20:40:35	@Espyo	at least, it very much seems like it
2016-05-25 20:40:45	@Espyo	since if you use free-cam to look under the ground, it's the same model
2016-05-25 20:40:56	@Espyo	just with different proportions
2016-05-25 20:41:05	@Espyo	further, the game probably has a list of seeds on the current area
2016-05-25 20:41:13	@Espyo	and it reuses slots in this list
2016-05-25 20:42:24	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-25 20:42:29	@Espyo	imagine a seed slot has the info: type = Red, X = 5 and Y = 5, buried for = 600 seconds, maturity = bud
2016-05-25 20:42:34	Marty2000	So it's somehow similar to the leaders glitch
2016-05-25 20:42:59	@Espyo	to reuse a slot, it removes the old information (so type = invalid, X = 0, Y = 0, buried for = 0 seconds, maturity = ...)
2016-05-25 20:43:01	@Espyo	except for the maturity
2016-05-25 20:43:04	@Espyo	they forgot to clear out the maturity
2016-05-25 20:43:08	@Espyo	so the data stays in the slot
2016-05-25 20:43:26	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-25 20:43:32	@Espyo	wait, actually
2016-05-25 20:43:36	@Espyo	no, it doesn't clear the old info
2016-05-25 20:43:37	@Espyo	it doesn't need to
2016-05-25 20:43:49	@Espyo	when you get a NEW seed, it's assigned a slot
2016-05-25 20:43:56	@Espyo	and it overwrites the info on the old slot
2016-05-25 20:43:56	@Espyo	...MOST of it
2016-05-25 20:44:00	@Espyo	it doesn't overwrite the maturity
2016-05-25 20:44:02	@Espyo	because it doesn't matter
2016-05-25 20:44:12	@Espyo	the Pikmin type matters, coordinates too, etc.
2016-05-25 20:44:22	@Espyo	but the maturity should always be 0, for leaf
2016-05-25 20:44:35	@Espyo	so they didn't bother to set it to 0 since they always assumed
2016-05-25 20:44:40	@Espyo	and I guess it was never caught during testing
2016-05-25 20:44:47	@Espyo	when the seed DOES go in the ground, it starts the "buried for" timer
2016-05-25 20:45:05	@Espyo	and since it's actually been buried for a time less than what's needed for a bud or flower, it updates correctly to leaf
2016-05-25 20:45:15	@Espyo	I am VERY sure that that's what's happening
2016-05-25 20:45:43	@Espyo	but my problem though, is understanding why they reuse slots the way they do
2016-05-25 20:46:20	@Espyo	 0: [used], 1: [used], 2: [used], 3: [used], 4: [empty], 5: [empty]
2016-05-25 20:46:30	@Espyo	used by either an airborne seed or a buried Pikmin
2016-05-25 20:46:41	@Espyo	(this is an example scenario, btw, to help me figure out the order stuff)
2016-05-25 20:47:10	@Espyo	you pluck Pikmin 2, which happens to be a flower
2016-05-25 20:47:13	Marty2000	Makes sense
2016-05-25 20:47:38	@Espyo	 0: [used], 1: [used], 2: [empty (old flower)], 3: [used], 4: [empty], 5: [empty]
2016-05-25 20:47:46	@Espyo	and then you pluck 0, which is a bud
2016-05-25 20:47:53	@Espyo	 0: [empty (old bud)], 1: [used], 2: [empty (old flower)], 3: [used], 4: [empty], 5: [empty]
2016-05-25 20:47:55	@Espyo	but... then what?
2016-05-25 20:47:59	@Espyo	the game needs to create one new seed
2016-05-25 20:48:03	@Espyo	it grabs one of the old slots
2016-05-25 20:48:16	@Espyo	it'd make sense for it to check the list and use the first vacant spot
2016-05-25 20:48:24	@Espyo	...but according to this example, it'd create a seed that's a bud
2016-05-25 20:48:33	@Espyo	and we know that it should've ejected a flower
2016-05-25 20:48:44	@Espyo	since you plucked a flower first, then a bud
2016-05-25 20:48:55	@Espyo	so I'm trying to imagine what the game does to organize them
2016-05-25 20:49:06	@Espyo	oh, maybe...
2016-05-25 20:49:14	@Espyo	it has two lists
2016-05-25 20:49:19	@Espyo	one for used, one for empty
2016-05-25 20:49:31	@Espyo	used: [0], [1], [2], [3]
2016-05-25 20:49:38	@Espyo	free:
2016-05-25 20:49:45	@Espyo	you pluck Pikmin 2, which is a flower
2016-05-25 20:49:54	@Espyo	used: [0], [1], [3]
2016-05-25 20:50:04	@Espyo	free: [2 (contains data for a flower Pikmin)]
2016-05-25 20:50:07	@Espyo	then you pluck 0
2016-05-25 20:50:13	@Espyo	it moves the slot 0 to the end of the "free" list
2016-05-25 20:50:19	@Espyo	used: [1], [3]
2016-05-25 20:50:28	@Espyo	free: [2 (flower)], [0 (bud)]
2016-05-25 20:50:36	@Espyo	so when it's time to create a new seed...
2016-05-25 20:50:43	@Espyo	it grabs one of the free ones, presumably the first on the list
2016-05-25 20:50:55	@Espyo	used: [1], [3], [2 (flower!)]
2016-05-25 20:50:58	@Espyo	free: [0]
2016-05-25 20:51:04	@Espyo	and then a new seed, once again, becomes:
2016-05-25 20:51:17	@Espyo	used: [1], [3], [2 (flower!)], [0 (bud!)]
2016-05-25 20:51:20	@Espyo	free:
2016-05-25 20:51:22	@Espyo	yeah, I think that's it!
2016-05-25 20:51:30	@Espyo	I'd love to test by memory watchig
2016-05-25 20:51:31	@Espyo	*watching
2016-05-25 20:51:37	@Espyo	but that'll probably be a bitch
2016-05-25 20:51:44	@Espyo	because there are a lot of ways to do this double-list
2016-05-25 20:51:55	@Espyo	and if they're using pointers, I might as well give up the fight right now
2016-05-25 20:52:04	@Espyo	but that's very likely the explanation, at least in my eyes
2016-05-25 20:52:17	Marty2000	You should point it out, then
2016-05-25 20:52:19	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-25 20:52:24	@Espyo	so yeah, it's pretty similar to the leader thing!
2016-05-25 20:52:32	Marty2000	Yep!
2016-05-25 20:52:40	@Espyo	also explains why it goes through Pikmin types
2016-05-25 20:52:47	@Espyo	because there's not one list per type
2016-05-25 20:53:08	@Espyo	but, I'd REALLY prefer to have some objective info about the way this works, if I'm to put it on the wiki
2016-05-25 20:53:14	@Espyo	because I'm thinking of putting it on the "seed" article
2016-05-25 20:53:22	@Espyo	and then link to it on the glitches page
2016-05-25 20:53:22	Marty2000	That's what I though too
2016-05-25 20:53:25	Marty2000	thought*
2016-05-25 20:53:31	@Espyo	since I want to explain it in detail and all
2016-05-25 20:53:41	@Espyo	putting a THEORY on the glitches page is fine
2016-05-25 20:53:47	@Espyo	putting a theory on a normal page isn't...
2016-05-25 20:53:52	@Espyo	I'll try to take a look
2016-05-25 20:54:49	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-25 20:59:22	@Espyo	good news, found the address that keeps the maturity of this one seed
2016-05-25 20:59:32	@Espyo	if my theory is correct, the list's data should be nearby
2016-05-25 21:00:10	@Espyo	pointing it down here for safekeeping: the maturity of the seed on slot 0 (presumably) is 0x010425F3
2016-05-25 21:00:51	@Espyo	ok, I plucked the Pikmin, and the variable is still the same
2016-05-25 21:00:51	@Espyo	good
2016-05-25 21:01:47	@Espyo	the variable is the same with a new mid-flight seed...!
2016-05-25 21:02:06	@Espyo	YES!
2016-05-25 21:02:13	@Espyo	it's a zero after it landed and turned into a leaf
2016-05-25 21:02:19	@Espyo	so that proves part of it: the game is reusing slots
2016-05-25 21:02:26	@Espyo	AND it's not clearing out the maturity info
2016-05-25 21:03:04	Marty2000	Great job!
2016-05-25 21:03:14	@Espyo	now if I can find nearby info...
2016-05-25 21:03:16	@Espyo	this will be amazing
2016-05-25 21:06:59	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-25 21:07:07	@Espyo	I think Dolphin's debugger isn't very good
2016-05-25 21:07:20	@Espyo	I'm presumably looking at the same address I found in the memory view
2016-05-25 21:07:22	@Espyo	but it's not updating right
2016-05-25 21:07:27	@Espyo	Yoshi2: thoughts?
2016-05-25 21:08:10	@Espyo	oh, wait
2016-05-25 21:08:15	@Espyo	I can change view method
2016-05-25 21:08:19	@Espyo	oh hell yeah, now we're talking
2016-05-25 21:08:41	@Espyo	hmm, this could be tough
2016-05-25 21:09:29	Marty2000	I guess it was correct in P2 since it doesn't happen
2016-05-25 21:09:37	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-25 21:09:47	Marty2000	corrected*
2016-05-25 21:11:35	@Espyo	address for slot #2's maturity: 0x01042A33
2016-05-25 21:11:38	@Espyo	this will surely help me
2016-05-25 21:11:42	@Espyo	brb, dinner

2016-05-25 21:22:20	Yoshi2	I made a recording with framedumping today and the recording feels so weird
2016-05-25 21:22:29	Marty2000	Ah?
2016-05-25 21:23:11	Yoshi2	because I was playing the game at basically 1/3rd to 1/6th of the original speed, the resulting footage feels very TAS-like
2016-05-25 21:23:41	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-25 21:24:36	Yoshi2	with me having insane reflexes and switching from attacking one enemy instantly to attacking the next

2016-05-25 21:31:33	-->	Scruffy (Mibbit@179-777-1-60.lightspeed.chtnsc.sbcglobal.net) has joined #pikipedia
2016-05-25 21:31:44	Scruffy	Hello everyone!
2016-05-25 21:31:54	Marty2000	Hey Scruffy! Welcome back!
2016-05-25 21:31:58	Scruffy	Thank yoU!
2016-05-25 21:32:01	Scruffy	u
2016-05-25 21:32:07	Scruffy	It's good to be back!
2016-05-25 21:32:22	Marty2000	Long time no see! How was your trip?
2016-05-25 21:32:45	Scruffy	It was great! It was very refreshing to experience such a different culture from my own
2016-05-25 21:33:20	Marty2000	Good then!
2016-05-25 21:33:24	Scruffy	And to finally climb some hills! My home town is entirely flat, whereas in South Korea you're always close to mountains
2016-05-25 21:34:44	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-25 21:34:55	@Espyo	Yoshi2: all the better
2016-05-25 21:34:58	@Espyo	welcome back, Scruffy!
2016-05-25 21:35:07	Scruffy	Thank you Espyo and Marty2000!
2016-05-25 21:35:14	@Espyo	so you climbed, eh?
2016-05-25 21:35:19	Scruffy	A lot
2016-05-25 21:35:20	@Espyo	climbing like with gear, or just a hike?
2016-05-25 21:35:26	Scruffy	Just a hike
2016-05-25 21:35:38	Scruffy	There's never a flat road in Korea, you're always climbing
2016-05-25 21:35:47	Scruffy	or descending
2016-05-25 21:36:14	Scruffy	But my favorite moment was definitely serious hiking up Mount Hallasan, the tallest mountain/volcano in Korea
2016-05-25 21:36:22	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-25 21:36:24	@Espyo	good workout, I bet
2016-05-25 21:36:47	Scruffy	the views there were literally and figuratively breathtaking
2016-05-25 21:37:07	@Espyo	hah
2016-05-25 21:37:40	Scruffy	At the top is a tiny shop that sells ramen to whoever makes it that far
2016-05-25 21:37:51	Scruffy	it's the best ramen you'll ever have, after a hike like htaty
2016-05-25 21:37:53	Scruffy	that*
2016-05-25 21:38:07	@Espyo	heh, I bet
2016-05-25 21:38:08	@Espyo	sounds awesome
2016-05-25 21:38:11	Scruffy	Yeah
2016-05-25 21:38:23	Scruffy	Today I've spent 8 hours sleeping off the jetlag
2016-05-25 21:38:23	@Espyo	what about the culture and social interaction in general?
2016-05-25 21:38:29	@Espyo	oof, yeah...
2016-05-25 21:38:40	Scruffy	The culture's fresh and new, especially dining
2016-05-25 21:38:53	Scruffy	You have to take off your shoes before entering any building
2016-05-25 21:39:10	@Espyo	that seems like a thing on the East in general
2016-05-25 21:39:14	Scruffy	and then to eat you sit on the floor with legs crossed, at a table made for such a height
2016-05-25 21:39:25	@Espyo	really reminds me of Japanese culture
2016-05-25 21:39:32	Scruffy	in Korea it's all about self-service rather than waiters serving you
