2016-04-25 23:11:26	Nvortex	oh god that looks really good, but...
2016-04-25 23:11:50	Nvortex	the bottom part was meant to be black...
2016-04-25 23:12:17	Nvortex	i wrote it down that you didnt need to make that part like that because you wouldnt be able to see it tho
2016-04-25 23:12:41	Nvortex	it doesnt matter if it cant be changed tho
2016-04-25 23:12:47	Nvortex	it looks amazing
2016-04-25 23:13:04	ScruffyChat	The bottom part? You mean the underside of the tentacles?

2016-04-25 23:19:46	En_Passant	of our choosing
2016-04-25 23:20:03	@PikFan	what's the project's purpose?
2016-04-25 23:20:38	ScruffyChat	Espyo: for your time, the table presentation is at 19:51, formal presentation at 20:11
2016-04-25 23:21:09	@Espyo	okay
2016-04-25 23:21:30	En_Passant	They're supposed to be professional-grade projects much like what people actually do
2016-04-25 23:21:34	En_Passant	Mine's bad, though
2016-04-25 23:22:14	@PikFan	huh?
2016-04-25 23:22:18	@PikFan	how can it be bad?
2016-04-25 23:22:25	@PikFan	it's probably much better than what I could do
2016-04-25 23:24:04	En_Passant	My project was basically to learn what Espyo and Scruffy are good at
2016-04-25 23:24:56	En_Passant	The plan was to use Unreal and C++ to recreate the basics of Pikmin, learn a little about composing and make a track, and create a model of Olimar
2016-04-25 23:25:22	@PikFan	wow
2016-04-25 23:25:35	@PikFan	that's a lot to do in just 9 months
2016-04-25 23:26:43	En_Passant	Other (better) projects include eye scanning and recognition software, creating blueprints for 8 green houses and building one of them in real life, a prosthetic hand, etc.

2016-04-26 02:18:46	ScruffyChat	Hi PikFan!
2016-04-26 02:18:48	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2016-04-26 02:19:04	@PikFan	even though there's not anything going on
2016-04-26 02:19:17	@PikFan	so, you're leaving for South Korea in 8 days?
2016-04-26 02:19:21	ScruffyChat	yep
2016-04-26 02:19:24	@PikFan	nice
2016-04-26 02:19:31	@PikFan	I've never been
2016-04-26 02:19:34	ScruffyChat	And I won't be on until after May 24
2016-04-26 02:19:41	@PikFan	actually, I've never left the States at all

2016-04-26 02:20:30	@PikFan	hi Neo
2016-04-26 02:20:34	Neocraftz1553	Hello everyone!
2016-04-26 02:20:40	@PikFan	this is driving me insane
2016-04-26 02:20:40	Neocraftz1553	Hey Pikfan
2016-04-26 02:20:53	@PikFan	what is up with people always joining so close together
2016-04-26 02:21:02	Neocraftz1553	Its fun
2016-04-26 02:21:03	@PikFan	I don't get it
2016-04-26 02:21:11	@PikFan	it's driving me mad
2016-04-26 02:21:23	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-26 02:21:26	@PikFan	because it shouldn't happen
2016-04-26 02:21:31	@PikFan	and yet, it continues to do so
2016-04-26 02:21:31	ScruffyChat	It's just coincidence
2016-04-26 02:21:45	@PikFan	well yeah
2016-04-26 02:22:08	@PikFan	but, if you think about it statistically (which I am), it shouldn't happen that often
2016-04-26 02:22:13	@PikFan	but it does
2016-04-26 02:22:18	@PikFan	it violates my logic
2016-04-26 02:22:26	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-26 02:27:21	ScruffyChat	So I'm working on a new Youtube video, the Plasm Wraith one
2016-04-26 02:27:26	ScruffyChat	Finally started writing it
2016-04-26 02:27:45	ScruffyChat	Unfortunately this is also final exam time for me so I don't get a lot of time to work on it
2016-04-26 02:28:35	Neocraftz1553	Plasm Wraith?
2016-04-26 02:29:08	@PikFan	his theory about the Plasm Wraith
2016-04-26 02:29:11	@PikFan	the actual one
2016-04-26 02:29:27	Neocraftz1553	ah, I see
2016-04-26 02:33:55	ScruffyChat	It's not going to be a theory about what it /is/, per se
2016-04-26 02:34:05	ScruffyChat	There are plenty of theories on that
2016-04-26 02:34:12	ScruffyChat	It's more about what it /means/
2016-04-26 02:34:17	Neocraftz1553	Dance...
2016-04-26 02:34:26	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-26 02:34:28	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-26 02:35:12	Neocraftz1553	I know what you mean, like its intentions and such
2016-04-26 02:35:54	ScruffyChat	yeah, and its significance in the Pikmin story arc
2016-04-26 02:36:59	Neocraftz1553	besides it being a boss, of course
2016-04-26 02:37:05	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-04-26 02:41:51	Neocraftz1553	gmm
2016-04-26 02:42:03	@PikFan	?
2016-04-26 02:42:06	@PikFan	gmm?
2016-04-26 02:42:13	Nvortex	can you tell one theor?
2016-04-26 02:42:44	Nvortex	also, i had to stop watching saya no uta, its really draining me
2016-04-26 02:42:55	Nvortex	but it was just a 20 minute break
2016-04-26 02:43:05	@PikFan	draining how?
2016-04-26 02:43:14	Nvortex	i started feeling weird
2016-04-26 02:43:25	Nvortex	really tired
2016-04-26 02:43:29	@PikFan	woah
2016-04-26 02:43:50	Nvortex	i go to the gym but after marathoning this i felt like i was going to fell asleep any moment
2016-04-26 02:44:10	Nvortex	but its so good....
2016-04-26 02:44:18	@PikFan	it's luring you in
2016-04-26 02:44:34	Nvortex	and the videos arent even that long
2016-04-26 02:44:36	Neocraftz1553	*hmm
2016-04-26 02:44:36	Neocraftz1553	One of the disadvantage of chat is hums and hmms can be mispelled
2016-04-26 02:44:36	Neocraftz1553	Nvortex: I just watched up until part 12
2016-04-26 02:44:36	Neocraftz1553	Nvortex, I know what you mean...
2016-04-26 02:44:36	Neocraftz1553	I mean, he is both sleeping with a girl way younger than him, and a meat monster at the same time...
2016-04-26 02:44:38	Neocraftz1553	then he unknowingly eats one of his friends 
2016-04-26 02:44:39	Nvortex	like 10 minutes each
2016-04-26 02:44:47	Nvortex	but they just feel crazy long because of the story
2016-04-26 02:44:51	@PikFan	"please, Nvortex, don't leave me, keep watching me"
2016-04-26 02:45:01	@PikFan	Neo: your internet is lagging again
2016-04-26 02:45:09	@PikFan	all your text just appeared at once
2016-04-26 02:45:18	Neocraftz1553	But I probably shouldn't spoil much
2016-04-26 02:45:19	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-26 02:45:52	Neocraftz1553	I'm good at that :/
2016-04-26 02:46:26	Neocraftz1553	its not lagging... its being a fag...
2016-04-26 02:46:38	Neocraftz1553	Ugh... its disgusting, yet, strangely appealing...
2016-04-26 02:46:49	ScruffyChat	Oh yeah, short videos like that are the worst for your attention
2016-04-26 02:47:19	Nvortex	its a combination of short videos and story
2016-04-26 02:47:46	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-26 02:47:58	Nvortex	neocraftz, the cool stuff happens at part 13
2016-04-26 02:48:05	Nvortex	it was the point of no return for me
2016-04-26 02:48:13	Neocraftz1553	and memory...
2016-04-26 02:48:18	Neocraftz1553	dammit, I knew I should have downloaded it...
2016-04-26 02:48:24	ScruffyChat	Aww man, I beat the final tournament in Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, and it unlocks the ability to play all the tournaments over again
2016-04-26 02:48:32	Neocraftz1553	:p
2016-04-26 02:48:36	--	pi is now known as slpi

2016-04-26 02:49:23	Nvortex	sometimes he calls himself sleepi
2016-04-26 02:49:26	slpi	that's the point
2016-04-26 02:49:29	Neocraftz1553	yup

2016-04-26 02:52:44	Neocraftz1553	I think its funny how the youtuber censored the "sleeping together parts" of the video
2016-04-26 02:53:05	Neocraftz1553	theres not much to censor, body-wise...
2016-04-26 02:53:51	Neocraftz1553	so he/she just puts the mouse over the meat monster(shown as a girl in the main c's PoV)'s uh...
2016-04-26 02:54:12	Neocraftz1553	how do I say it....
2016-04-26 02:54:29	Neocraftz1553	lump? hehehe
2016-04-26 02:54:36	@PikFan	breast works
2016-04-26 02:54:44	Neocraftz1553	ok, lets go with that
2016-04-26 02:55:05	Neocraftz1553	although it does ruin chicken breasts for me :/
2016-04-26 02:55:12	@PikFan	oml
2016-04-26 02:55:30	Neocraftz1553	grab that juicy chicken breast :p

2016-04-26 02:58:31	@PikFan	well, that was an interesting recollection
2016-04-26 02:58:39	@PikFan	anyway, subject change
2016-04-26 02:58:53	@PikFan	so I've been considering writing a Splatoon and Pikmin crossover fic
2016-04-26 02:59:09	Neocraftz1553	Nice
2016-04-26 02:59:15	ScruffyChat	Oooooh
2016-04-26 02:59:22	@PikFan	it makes sense, because both games take place in a world that's post humanity
2016-04-26 02:59:33	Neocraftz1553	troo
2016-04-26 02:59:45	ScruffyChat	How would that work? There's quite a scale difference
2016-04-26 02:59:56	Neocraftz1553	time travel
2016-04-26 03:00:08	Neocraftz1553	wait no...
2016-04-26 03:00:13	@PikFan	either scale Pikmin up to the size of Inklings, or scale Inklings down to the size of Pikmin
2016-04-26 03:00:23	@PikFan	the latter makes more sense to me imo
2016-04-26 03:00:30	Neocraftz1553	I think its better to svale down
2016-04-26 03:00:34	Neocraftz1553	*scale
2016-04-26 03:00:40	@PikFan	but even then, I've yet to come up with a reasonable mechanic behind that
2016-04-26 03:00:48	Neocraftz1553	Time travel
2016-04-26 03:01:03	@PikFan	time travel is in here, yeah
2016-04-26 03:01:18	@PikFan	but I don't see how time travel could possibly scale them down
2016-04-26 03:01:20	Neocraftz1553	Teleportation WHILE Time traveling
2016-04-26 03:01:33	Neocraftz1553	A-ha!
2016-04-26 03:01:37	Neocraftz1553	I'm onto something
2016-04-26 03:02:29	ScruffyChat	Maybe Pikmin grow to that size in a couple hundred million years
2016-04-26 03:02:43	ScruffyChat	Or they had huge ancestors
2016-04-26 03:03:00	Neocraftz1553	*awkward silence follows*
2016-04-26 03:03:01	Neocraftz1553	but... I dunno...
2016-04-26 03:03:01	Neocraftz1553	I find giant pikmin sorta disturbing
2016-04-26 03:03:06	Neocraftz1553	for the same reason I find chicken breast disturbing
2016-04-26 03:03:23	@PikFan	can we not
2016-04-26 03:03:39	Neocraftz1553	XD
2016-04-26 03:03:40	@PikFan	anyway, hmm
2016-04-26 03:04:10	@PikFan	but Scruffy, if Pikmin are the size of humans...
2016-04-26 03:04:14	Neocraftz1553	cracking up over here :p
2016-04-26 03:04:30	@PikFan	then the artifacts in P2 are much bigger than we thought
2016-04-26 03:04:42	@PikFan	or are you talking about P3 Pikmin
2016-04-26 03:04:57	Neocraftz1553	because Pikmin and Giant don't mix for the same reason Chickens and Breasts don't 
2016-04-26 03:05:10	ScruffyChat	Well P3 Pikmin did kind of grow
2016-04-26 03:05:17	Neocraftz1553	They did?
2016-04-26 03:05:19	@PikFan	huh? how so?
2016-04-26 03:05:20	ScruffyChat	In relation to the fruit treasures
2016-04-26 03:05:28	ScruffyChat	They got comparatively a little bigger
2016-04-26 03:05:36	Neocraftz1553	(chicken breasts, THATS how...)
2016-04-26 03:05:45	@PikFan	that doesn't make sense
2016-04-26 03:05:55	@PikFan	because the Koppaites are the same size as Olimar
2016-04-26 03:06:06	@PikFan	and the Pikmin still seem relatively the same...
2016-04-26 03:06:16	Neocraftz1553	it does
2016-04-26 03:06:23	Neocraftz1553	oh, thought you were talking bout thee breasts
2016-04-26 03:06:25	@PikFan	unless if Olimar grew somehow and the Koppaites are actually bigger
2016-04-26 03:06:31	@PikFan	gah, this is confusing
2016-04-26 03:06:48	Neocraftz1553	ooooh, it makes sense
2016-04-26 03:06:52	ScruffyChat	Well according to Brittany oxygen causes gigantism
2016-04-26 03:06:53	Neocraftz1553	Olimar discovered Chicken's Breasts
2016-04-26 03:07:03	@PikFan	right
2016-04-26 03:07:11	Neocraftz1553	ok, I'll try to stop
2016-04-26 03:07:35	ScruffyChat	but at the very least Pikmin are stronger in P3
2016-04-26 03:07:41	Neocraftz1553	Wait, don't the Koppaites breath Oxegyn?
2016-04-26 03:07:42	@PikFan	wot
2016-04-26 03:07:47	ScruffyChat	it takes less Pikmin to carry everything
2016-04-26 03:07:49	Neocraftz1553	*Oxygen
2016-04-26 03:07:59	@PikFan	but that's not true
2016-04-26 03:08:14	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-26 03:08:14	Neocraftz1553	(or the enemies went on a chicken breast diet)
2016-04-26 03:08:14	@PikFan	it still takes 10 Pikmin to carry a Red Bulborb
2016-04-26 03:08:16	ScruffyChat	Well, most things
2016-04-26 03:08:28	@PikFan	actually, it now takes 12 Pikmin to carry a Bulbear
2016-04-26 03:08:32	Neocraftz1553	no chicken breasts for the Red Bulborb, then
2016-04-26 03:08:44	@PikFan	somehow the Bulbear got heavier...?
2016-04-26 03:08:54	Neocraftz1553	Hmm... maybe change of species?
2016-04-26 03:09:03	Neocraftz1553	A beneficial mutation?
2016-04-26 03:09:10	@PikFan	I'm of the opinion that the Pikmin's strength haven't changed, but rather the biomass of all the creatures
2016-04-26 03:09:16	@PikFan	well, not all, but some
2016-04-26 03:09:18	Neocraftz1553	(not sure how weight could be beneficial, though)
2016-04-26 03:09:43	Neocraftz1553	Wait, now I know
2016-04-26 03:09:48	@PikFan	okay, this has been a very interesting tangent
2016-04-26 03:10:00	Neocraftz1553	Chicken Breasts?
2016-04-26 03:10:17	@PikFan	I'll come up with some explanation as to why Inklings are now the same size as Pikmin
2016-04-26 03:10:32	@PikFan	perhaps there was an error during the time travel
2016-04-26 03:10:34	ScruffyChat	Maybe they were always
2016-04-26 03:10:43	ScruffyChat	And Splatoon is all miniature
2016-04-26 03:10:55	@PikFan	heh, perhaps
2016-04-26 03:10:56	Neocraftz1553	hmm... could be, buuuuut.....
2016-04-26 03:11:08	@PikFan	can't argue with that
2016-04-26 03:11:17	Neocraftz1553	actually, let me stop right there
2016-04-26 03:11:47	@PikFan	I've got Pikmin using machinery, so saying that Splatoon's characters are NOT small contradicts my own works
2016-04-26 03:12:17	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-26 03:12:24	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-26 03:12:27	@PikFan	someone should make a Nintendo Theory
2016-04-26 03:12:42	Neocraftz1553	truer than breasts on chicken
2016-04-26 03:12:43	Neocraftz1553	I got something new
2016-04-26 03:12:54	@PikFan	like the Pixar Theory, but instead for all of Nintendo's franchises
2016-04-26 03:13:00	Neocraftz1553	truer than NUGGETS on a chicken
2016-04-26 03:13:09	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-26 03:13:50	Neocraftz1553	whats the Pixar Theory about?
2016-04-26 03:14:06	ScruffyChat	Okay well it's obvious that Pikmin was a dream that Kirby had after he saw the portrait of future Captain Falcon
2016-04-26 03:14:27	Neocraftz1553	true
2016-04-26 03:14:33	@PikFan	lolwut
2016-04-26 03:14:51	Neocraftz1553	but you have something wrong there Scruffy
2016-04-26 03:15:12	Neocraftz1553	after he saw the picture, he saw MARII throw LUIGI
2016-04-26 03:15:22	Neocraftz1553	and thus, Pikmin 2 was spawned
2016-04-26 03:15:54	Neocraftz1553	but the captain throwning wasn't until 4/20 when Kirby was high AF
2016-04-26 03:16:03	Neocraftz1553	and there came Pikmin 3
2016-04-26 03:16:15	Neocraftz1553	Rock Pikmin showed how stoned he was
2016-04-26 03:16:34	ScruffyChat	Wait, it couldn't have been a dream, because how could Louie have predicted that Koppai's moon would eventually hurtle toward Terminus?
2016-04-26 03:16:48	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-04-26 03:17:17	Neocraftz1553	maybe All the adventures DID happen and Kirby was seeing them unfold
2016-04-26 03:17:23	Neocraftz1553	while he was high
2016-04-26 03:17:36	Neocraftz1553	every ten years on 4/20 at 4:20
2016-04-26 03:18:00	Neocraftz1553	you will unlock secrets
2016-04-26 03:18:02	Neocraftz1553	thats why it took around 10 years for P3 to come out
2016-04-26 03:18:09	@PikFan	Terminus? why are you getting Walking Dead mixed up in all this? :P
2016-04-26 03:18:12	Neocraftz1553	P2 Kirby was just lucky
2016-04-26 03:18:28	Neocraftz1553	Because if you look closely...
2016-04-26 03:18:46	Neocraftz1553	you can see the S. S. Drake take off in the Walking dead
2016-04-26 03:19:03	Neocraftz1553	in the distance
2016-04-26 03:19:30	Nvortex	we had a theory on pikmin and splatoon being in the same universe too
2016-04-26 03:19:54	@PikFan	wb Nvortex

2016-04-26 03:39:32	@PikFan	but it uses tachyons, I know that much
2016-04-26 03:39:40	Neocraftz1553	it is learning wrapped in a nice henia/anime package ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

2016-04-26 03:40:30	ScruffyChat	So they cheated
2016-04-26 03:40:42	@PikFan	baryons are always under the speed of light ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
2016-04-26 03:40:48	@PikFan	and tachyons are always faster ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
2016-04-26 03:41:04	@PikFan	but how could something reach infinite speed if it had zero energy? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

2016-04-26 04:30:15	Neocraftz1553	Once, I bred Cockroaches
2016-04-26 04:30:31	Neocraftz1553	it was certainly... interesting
2016-04-26 04:30:54	Neocraftz1553	Once, I forgot to feed em for a week, vacation reasons
2016-04-26 04:31:21	Neocraftz1553	then I checked on them and they had overpopulated the aquarium :/
2016-04-26 04:31:29	Neocraftz1553	I fried them and ate them covered in chocolate
2016-04-26 04:31:49	Neocraftz1553	just kidding, that would make me feel guilty

2016-04-26 04:32:42	ScruffyChat	Same
2016-04-26 04:32:53	Neocraftz1553	Then this other time, I ran an... expirement
2016-04-26 04:32:58	Neocraftz1553	on one of em
2016-04-26 04:33:04	Bulborbs_At_View	I feel bad about killing even mosquitoes. And I hate mosquitoes
2016-04-26 04:33:19	ScruffyChat	So how is it that we readily kill Pikmin enemies/
2016-04-26 04:33:35	Neocraftz1553	I had it for quite a while isolated, and it grew huuuge
2016-04-26 04:33:38	Bulborbs_At_View	Because it,s a game I guess...
2016-04-26 04:33:48	Neocraftz1553	Scruffy: because they make more Pikmin
2016-04-26 04:33:51	Bulborbs_At_View	But even in Pikmin I sometimes feel slightly bad killing them
2016-04-26 04:34:07	Neocraftz1553	no but seriously, I feel guilty after playing it if I killed something
2016-04-26 04:34:21	Neocraftz1553	I think, " what if it had a family?"

2016-04-26 04:46:36	ScruffyChat	I was wondering why Saya no uta and Ai no uta were so similar in name yet different in everything else

2016-04-26 04:47:45	@PikFan	yeah, in Japanese, the particle no (の) means of or 's
2016-04-26 04:48:01	@PikFan	so, for instance
2016-04-26 04:48:16	@PikFan	"watashi no inu" means "my dog"
2016-04-26 04:48:50	@PikFan	brb

2016-04-26 04:50:57	ScruffyChat	Yes
2016-04-26 04:51:08	ScruffyChat	The Shiba Inu
2016-04-26 04:51:44	ScruffyChat	One particular one became the meme "doge" by making a particularly wide-eyed face

2016-04-26 05:00:55	@PikFan	well, actually, this isn't true
2016-04-26 05:01:31	@PikFan	so we have the character は, which, when read out loud, says "ha"
2016-04-26 05:01:48	@PikFan	but, は can also be used as a particle

2016-04-26 05:01:56	Neocraftz1553	ok, it works
2016-04-26 05:01:59	@PikFan	when used as a particle, は reads "wa"
2016-04-26 05:02:20	Neocraftz1553	sorry, keyboard actibg weird
2016-04-26 05:02:20	Neocraftz1553	*acting
2016-04-26 05:02:25	@PikFan	another weird one is を
2016-04-26 05:02:49	@PikFan	you can read it as both "o" OR "wo"
2016-04-26 05:03:08	@PikFan	but the latter isn't used so much

2016-04-26 05:05:06	Neocraftz1553	Trying to make Pikmin 2 HD renders
2016-04-26 05:05:18	ScruffyChat	oooh
2016-04-26 05:06:29	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-26 05:07:21	Neocraftz1553	So far, I'm working on the Yellow Pikmin Scene when you first spot them
2016-04-26 05:07:59	Neocraftz1553	oooh, I'd love to see Nintendo make a Pikmin 2 in Pikmin 3 style
2016-04-26 05:08:24	Neocraftz1553	with the onions changed
2016-04-26 05:08:24	Neocraftz1553	hitbox events
2016-04-26 05:08:24	ScruffyChat	Me too
2016-04-26 05:08:56	Bulborbs_At_View	Pikmin 1 with Pikmin 3 engine would be cool to see :P
2016-04-26 05:09:35	ScruffyChat	If I could just get normal maps to look in Pikmin 2, it would look much more HD right off the bat
2016-04-26 05:09:47	ScruffyChat	to be accepted in Pikmin 2*
2016-04-26 05:10:11	Neocraftz1553	like the Red Bulborbs eyes 
2016-04-26 05:10:22	Neocraftz1553	Maybe Arachnorbs recoil if Purple Pikmin stomp on them?
2016-04-26 05:10:22	Neocraftz1553	oh man, sooo many things Nintendo could do
2016-04-26 05:10:22	Neocraftz1553	in fact, if they sold the trilogy in P3 I bet it would sell well
2016-04-26 05:10:22	Neocraftz1553	Bulborbs_At_View: I'd love to see one and two like that!
2016-04-26 05:10:44	Neocraftz1553	ah, yes
2016-04-26 05:10:44	Neocraftz1553	The imperfections perfect it
2016-04-26 05:10:44	Neocraftz1553	and replacing the grass texture with grass particles
2016-04-26 05:10:58	ScruffyChat	well, that wasn't in P3 though
2016-04-26 05:10:59	Neocraftz1553	that are dynamic
2016-04-26 05:10:59	Neocraftz1553	that would add realism
2016-04-26 05:10:59	Neocraftz1553	if they sway when you walk on them
2016-04-26 05:11:07	Neocraftz1553	but, I imagine increased lag
2016-04-26 05:11:52	Neocraftz1553	yeah, most probably because of kag
2016-04-26 05:11:59	Neocraftz1553	*lag
2016-04-26 05:11:59	Neocraftz1553	yeah, kag, I blame it on kag
2016-04-26 05:12:20	Neocraftz1553	but anyways, if they added dynamic grass instead of textures, that would add LOTS of beauty, don't you agree?
2016-04-26 05:12:56	ScruffyChat	Yes I suppose
2016-04-26 05:13:29	ScruffyChat	But even little things like active background shadows in P3 would increase the realism a lot in the first two games
2016-04-26 05:13:38	ScruffyChat	And I feel like that could somehow be achieved
2016-04-26 05:14:27	Neocraftz1553	Like in PF, actually
2016-04-26 05:14:36	ScruffyChat	Heh

2016-04-26 05:16:09	Neocraftz1553	yeah, dynamic grass
2016-04-26 05:16:09	Neocraftz1553	but lets move dynamic grass aside, what aboouuuut...
2016-04-26 05:16:09	Neocraftz1553	dynamic dirt...
2016-04-26 05:16:09	Neocraftz1553	no, too lag infested...
2016-04-26 05:16:09	Neocraftz1553	and complex...
2016-04-26 05:16:10	Neocraftz1553	yup
2016-04-26 05:16:10	Neocraftz1553	if they were more like P3, in general
2016-04-26 05:16:11	Neocraftz1553	like enemy reactions(hitbox events)
2016-04-26 05:16:12	Neocraftz1553	thats the main thing I like, besides graphics
2016-04-26 05:16:14	Neocraftz1553	Who doesn't like hitting a Bulborbs eye(not those at view, though)

2016-04-26 05:42:10	Neocraftz1553	maybe after he's back from his trip

2016-04-26 08:52:50	Neocraftz1553	speaking of explicitness, CHICKEN BREASTS
2016-04-26 08:53:32	Yoshi2	I am currently thinking about what to eat
2016-04-26 08:53:42	Neocraftz1553	Breasts
2016-04-26 08:54:04	Neocraftz1553	Nuggets

2016-04-26 08:56:21	Yoshi2	fitting considering we were talking about cannibalism earlier

2016-04-26 08:58:08	Neocraftz1553	hey , if anyone sees this log:

2016-04-26 08:59:50	Neocraftz1553	ok, this is going too fat
2016-04-26 08:59:56	Neocraftz1553	*far
2016-04-26 09:00:09	Yoshi2	and too fat
2016-04-26 09:00:12	Yoshi2	too much fat
2016-04-26 09:00:17	Neocraftz1553	heh
2016-04-26 09:00:43	Yoshi2	but don't worry when Pi is back he will see this and he
2016-04-26 09:00:45	Yoshi2	might do stuff
2016-04-26 09:00:47	Yoshi2	or ignore it
2016-04-26 09:00:55	Neocraftz1553	hmph
2016-04-26 09:01:12	Neocraftz1553	wonder when he'll be back
2016-04-26 09:01:34	Yoshi2	in the next few hours
2016-04-26 09:01:45	Yoshi2	you will probably be asleep by then
2016-04-26 09:02:01	Yoshi2	unless you get some hot chocolate (°V°)
2016-04-26 09:02:10	Neocraftz1553	hehehe
2016-04-26 09:02:40	Neocraftz1553	a few hours back, I made some disgusting tasting concoction. 
2016-04-26 09:03:15	Neocraftz1553	Chocolate syrup, powder, coffee, sugar, weird powder additive, creamer, and who knows what
2016-04-26 09:03:57	Neocraftz1553	I decided not to drink... smelled and tasted unhealthy and unnaturally sweet yet bitter
2016-04-26 09:06:33	Yoshi2	did you add all that into a single cup?
2016-04-26 09:06:56	Yoshi2	!def concoction
2016-04-26 09:06:57	M6	The act or process of concocting.
2016-04-26 09:07:01	Yoshi2	!def concocting
2016-04-26 09:07:02	M6	To prepare or make by combining ingredients, especially in cookery: to concoct a meal from leftovers.
2016-04-26 09:07:10	Neocraftz1553	hm?
2016-04-26 09:07:20	Yoshi2	ok, I was thinking of the right thing
2016-04-26 09:07:30	Neocraftz1553	M6 has a robo buddy? 
2016-04-26 09:07:31	Yoshi2	did you add all those ingredients into one cup?
2016-04-26 09:07:36	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-04-26 09:07:45	Neocraftz1553	because why not
2016-04-26 09:07:48	Yoshi2	whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
2016-04-26 09:07:58	Yoshi2	what were you thinking
2016-04-26 09:08:14	Neocraftz1553	Ok, so
2016-04-26 09:08:24	Yoshi2	were you high on hot choco again
2016-04-26 09:08:27	Neocraftz1553	we ran out of normal sugar and cocoa powder
2016-04-26 09:08:34	Neocraftz1553	so I used syrup
2016-04-26 09:08:45	Neocraftz1553	and some weird sugar packets
2016-04-26 09:09:04	Neocraftz1553	and some water and milk
2016-04-26 09:09:13	Neocraftz1553	then I tasted, tasted horrible
2016-04-26 09:09:47	Neocraftz1553	I added cream and not sure what else, and I drank it, it tasted bitter, yet sweet, and I drank a good deal of it
2016-04-26 09:10:11	Neocraftz1553	I decided to stop because it was starting to taste weird
2016-04-26 09:10:30	Yoshi2	at that point I'd just drink the milk as-is
2016-04-26 09:10:36	Neocraftz1553	watery texture, with an iron and sugar taste
2016-04-26 09:10:42	Yoshi2	without adding any stuff to it
2016-04-26 09:10:55	Neocraftz1553	(iron tastes like blood, btw)
2016-04-26 09:11:08	Neocraftz1553	Yoshi2: I MUST HAVE MY CHOCOLATE COFFEE
2016-04-26 09:11:19	Yoshi2	blood tastes like iron
2016-04-26 09:11:25	Yoshi2	because blood has iron in it
2016-04-26 09:11:27	Neocraftz1553	yeah, that
2016-04-26 09:11:35	Neocraftz1553	the irony of it, eh?
2016-04-26 09:11:47	Yoshi2	i am slightly concerned about how you said iron tastes like blood
2016-04-26 09:12:00	Neocraftz1553	why is that?
2016-04-26 09:12:27	Yoshi2	almost as if you drank blood first
2016-04-26 09:12:35	Neocraftz1553	yeah
2016-04-26 09:12:47	Yoshi2	you vampire
2016-04-26 09:12:50	Yoshi2	stay away from me
2016-04-26 09:13:01	Neocraftz1553	I AM A DAMNED VAMPIRE THAT IS WEAK TO MARSHMALLOWS! MUAHAHAHAHA
2016-04-26 09:13:10	Neocraftz1553	just kidding
2016-04-26 09:13:34	Neocraftz1553	but... blood does taste like iron and vice versa
2016-04-26 09:13:37	Neocraftz1553	sorta
2016-04-26 09:13:51	Neocraftz1553	iron tastes slightly different
2016-04-26 09:14:10	Yoshi2	tasting blood is very high on my list of things I will never do
2016-04-26 09:14:19	Neocraftz1553	me too
2016-04-26 09:14:29	Neocraftz1553	I had to take supplements, silly :p
2016-04-26 09:14:48	Neocraftz1553	or are THOSE blood too... hmm...
2016-04-26 09:15:08	Neocraftz1553	actually, come to think of it, I HAVE drunken blood
2016-04-26 09:15:22	Neocraftz1553	from my nose, mouth, and nails
2016-04-26 09:15:26	Neocraftz1553	don't worry
2016-04-26 09:17:59	Yoshi2	you are making saya no uta look sane
2016-04-26 09:18:46	Neocraftz1553	hah
2016-04-26 09:19:07	Neocraftz1553	I don't do it purposefully 
2016-04-26 09:19:23	Yoshi2	how do you even drink blood from nose/mouth/NAILS
2016-04-26 09:20:29	Neocraftz1553	Bloody nose: when its too hot or get punched in the nose I bleed, and thus, some gets in my mouth
2016-04-26 09:20:46	Neocraftz1553	Mouth: when I get punched or something cuts me
2016-04-26 09:20:54	Neocraftz1553	Nails: I chew my nails
2016-04-26 09:22:06	Yoshi2	i kinda expected you to say that your nails are punched too
2016-04-26 09:22:11	Neocraftz1553	well... there are many reasons for why my nose might bleed
2016-04-26 09:22:25	Neocraftz1553	thankfully, it doesn't happen often
2016-04-26 09:22:43	Neocraftz1553	heh, my nails get punched, how does that happen
2016-04-26 09:23:49	Yoshi2	have you tried getting punched less
2016-04-26 09:23:56	Yoshi2	or do you do boxing or some similar sport
2016-04-26 09:24:35	Neocraftz1553	I have been in a similar sport, but not anymore
2016-04-26 09:24:42	Neocraftz1553	I don't get punched often
2016-04-26 09:25:03	Neocraftz1553	usually I'm pretty swift
2016-04-26 09:25:24	Yoshi2	I try to not get into fights nowadays, seems to work pretty well
2016-04-26 09:26:43	Neocraftz1553	yes, I know 
2016-04-26 09:26:53	Neocraftz1553	never fight unless necessary 
2016-04-26 09:27:51	Yoshi2	so how does your mouth get cut
2016-04-26 09:28:21	Neocraftz1553	teeth
2016-04-26 09:28:27	Neocraftz1553	bruising
2016-04-26 09:29:10	Neocraftz1553	thankfully, I don't get punched there very often 
2016-04-26 09:29:32	Yoshi2	I'd be worried if you were
2016-04-26 09:30:25	Neocraftz1553	yes
2016-04-26 09:30:35	Neocraftz1553	I do worry
2016-04-26 09:31:05	Neocraftz1553	I don't fight often, though
2016-04-26 09:31:24	Neocraftz1553	I'm not in the sport anymore 
2016-04-26 09:39:53	Yoshi2	there is only one thing left
2016-04-26 09:40:02	Yoshi2	stop chewing nails so much that your fingers bleed :>
2016-04-26 09:42:26	Yoshi2	Neocraftz1553: kek the download on the site you gave me is marked as a phishing site

2016-04-26 15:05:52	Marty2000	Hi
2016-04-26 15:06:30	mindcraftlover99	Is pikmin 4 really coming on the NX

2016-04-26 15:07:11	Marty2000	We do not actually know whether it'll be released on the NX or the Wii U (or even another console)
2016-04-26 15:07:40	mindcraftlover99	Maybe it would be like last time and it would take 7 years for it to just come out XD
2016-04-26 15:08:11	Marty2000	I hope it won't take so much time... Now that they've announced it, I'm waiting for it so much
2016-04-26 15:08:37	mindcraftlover99	That was the same with pikmin 3 they announced it would come on wii but then it didn't

2016-04-26 15:09:37	mindcraftlover99	Lets hope it does actually come out soon. Either this year or next year.
2016-04-26 15:09:51	mindcraftlover99	Well when the NX does come out.
2016-04-26 15:09:56	Marty2000	Yes, that would be great
2016-04-26 15:11:16	UltraMario	eh
2016-04-26 15:11:19	UltraMario	i dunno
2016-04-26 15:11:26	UltraMario	i dont want nx this soon tbh
2016-04-26 15:11:35	UltraMario	i dont feel like buying another console yet
2016-04-26 15:11:36	mindcraftlover99	The wii u still needs more games.
2016-04-26 15:11:36	UltraMario	:P

2016-04-26 15:12:01	UltraMario	also hi
2016-04-26 15:12:04	Marty2000	No main Kirby or Animal Crossing on Wii U

2016-04-26 15:12:22	UltraMario	exactly
2016-04-26 15:12:33	UltraMario	and it seems we may not even get those
2016-04-26 15:12:43	UltraMario	also im hoping zelda u wont get move to nx
2016-04-26 15:12:53	UltraMario	*moved
2016-04-26 15:13:00	mindcraftlover99	What would it be called.
2016-04-26 15:13:05	mindcraftlover99	Zelda NX?
2016-04-26 15:13:15	UltraMario	no
2016-04-26 15:13:25	UltraMario	zelda games never have the title of the system in the name
2016-04-26 15:13:26	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-26 15:13:36	UltraMario	they always have some kind of subtitle
2016-04-26 15:13:47	mindcraftlover99	I know.
2016-04-26 15:13:50	UltraMario	well
2016-04-26 15:13:53	UltraMario	the remakes dont count
2016-04-26 15:14:05	UltraMario	since it makes sense they'd name those differently
2016-04-26 15:14:05	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-26 15:14:28	Klemen702	pretty sure when P4 was first announced they said it's ''close to completion''
2016-04-26 15:14:29	mindcraftlover99	I don't think they should have made the twilight princess remake.
2016-04-26 15:14:40	UltraMario	why not
2016-04-26 15:14:51	UltraMario	too soon?
2016-04-26 15:14:57	mindcraftlover99	Yeah.
2016-04-26 15:15:13	UltraMario	eh, i mean, it may be a bit soon, but i dont mind
2016-04-26 15:15:28	UltraMario	btw
2016-04-26 15:15:36	UltraMario	i wonder if they made it on wwhd's engine
2016-04-26 15:15:37	UltraMario	because
2016-04-26 15:15:47	UltraMario	the original tp ran on ww's
2016-04-26 15:15:48	UltraMario	iirc
2016-04-26 15:16:00	UltraMario	it was like on a heavily modified ww engine i think
2016-04-26 15:16:14	mindcraftlover99	Windwaker hd was a nice looking game.
2016-04-26 15:16:20	UltraMario	indeed
2016-04-26 15:16:38	UltraMario	i hate how ww got so much hate when it was announced

2016-04-26 15:25:16	UltraMario	yeah, im a fan of a cartoony aesthetic
2016-04-26 15:25:26	UltraMario	i do like how ss did a bit of both though

2016-04-26 18:41:19	Yoshi2	actually it is mathematical logic

2016-04-26 18:47:54	Testyo	I said Espyo: sometimes you can make a guess and get it right, but even if it sounds right, you won't know that method to whatever price they want because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages Espyo: sometimes you can make a guess and get it right, but even if it sounds right, you won't know that until you have looked it up and
2016-04-26 18:47:54	Testyo	then, each sub-class overrides that method to whatever price they want. They were joined by the common word that.

2016-04-26 19:22:13	Bulborbs_At_View	I've lamented about Pikmin X-3's disappointing turn-out but that's not very important xD
2016-04-26 19:22:27	Yoshi2	you can either be part of the problem and complain about how the chat is quiet, or you could try talking about stuff :>
2016-04-26 19:22:31	Bulborbs_At_View	After all 2 players' better than nothing :P
2016-04-26 19:22:43	Nvortex	how do i get there

2016-04-26 19:25:25	Nvortex	cant i use the one in the pikipedia forums?
2016-04-26 19:25:28	Bulborbs_At_View	Oh, from Pikipedia to Pikmin X-3? I think so...
2016-04-26 19:25:35	Bulborbs_At_View	I don't know how Proboards accounts work
2016-04-26 19:26:15	Bulborbs_At_View	It's a different forum so I don't think it'll carry over
2016-04-26 19:26:30	Bulborbs_At_View	I guess you can try to log in with your Pikipedia details and see what happens
2016-04-26 19:27:54	Yoshi2	probably different databases, different acc details

2016-04-26 19:32:57	Bulborbs_At_View	Was the account thing a dealbreaker for you, nvortex?
2016-04-26 19:33:07	Nvortex	...yep
2016-04-26 19:33:15	Nvortex	i dont like have multiple accounts
2016-04-26 19:33:22	Bulborbs_At_View	Hm :/
2016-04-26 19:33:48	Bulborbs_At_View	Well that's not really my fault, unless there's a way to allow linking Pikipedia accounts with my forum.
2016-04-26 19:34:06	Bulborbs_At_View	Which I don't think there is without some really crazy web knowledge, something I do not have
2016-04-26 19:34:21	Nvortex	you know, i think i can actually use the one in pikipedia but i forgot the password
2016-04-26 19:34:38	Nvortex	when  tried logging in it already said i was logged but needed to log in the other one
2016-04-26 19:36:01	Bulborbs_At_View	Maybe the Proboards account does link after all...
2016-04-26 19:36:06	Bulborbs_At_View	That would be really neat
2016-04-26 19:37:59	Bulborbs_At_View	What did you mean by "log in the other one"?
2016-04-26 19:39:06	Nvortex	log in pikmin-x3
2016-04-26 19:39:52	Bulborbs_At_View	So you tried to log in to Pikmin X-3, but you needed to log in there?
2016-04-26 19:39:57	 *	Bulborbs_At_View is confused xD
2016-04-26 19:41:23	Nvortex	i was logged in proboards (apparently) because my name appeared up there and said "welcome nvortex" but it said that i had to log in pikmin x-3 proboards
2016-04-26 19:41:32	Nvortex	but i forgot the password 
2016-04-26 19:42:22	Bulborbs_At_View	Can't you reset it or something?
2016-04-26 19:43:14	UltraMario	NO RESETTIN
2016-04-26 19:43:15	Testyo	Try using your inner voice, eesh!
2016-04-26 19:43:15	UltraMario	:P
2016-04-26 19:43:17	Nvortex	i would have to log out and i think i didnt set an email account (because i dont like having stuff set there, thats why i dont like having multiple accounts)
2016-04-26 19:44:01	Bulborbs_At_View	Couldn't you make another email account to use for receiving all the random stuff?
2016-04-26 19:44:47	Bulborbs_At_View	Well in any case, I think you would need to make another account for it to show up in the database.
2016-04-26 19:45:17	Bulborbs_At_View	Which is probably what it means when it says "you need to be logged in on the Pikmin X-3 forum"
2016-04-26 19:46:14	Bulborbs_At_View	I'm guessing that's because otherwise the database would struggle to know who is actually a member of the forum and who's just a Proboards account or something like that

2016-04-26 20:22:05	Yoshi2	on windows my dolphin was able to dump in uncompressed AVI with options to use a different codec
2016-04-26 20:23:01	Yoshi2	on linux I could dump in avi too, but the codec is something lossy (but very high bitrate) and I couldn't change the codec

2016-04-27 20:30:55	@Espyo	he was probably too busy taking care of everything to even notice what we said
2016-04-27 20:32:03	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-27 20:33:33	ScruffyChat	Oh, on an unrelated note, I think I may have figured out how Bulborb eye lenses work today
2016-04-27 20:34:15	ScruffyChat	I was experimenting with the model for the p3 bulbear, and I thought I had cracked that the eyes have a lens and then the iris underneath
2016-04-27 20:34:49	ScruffyChat	The problem was that the iris was convex, it jutted out in front of the eye; real irises cave inward
2016-04-27 20:35:16	ScruffyChat	I could tell because the glossiness of the iris was on the wrong side of the eye
2016-04-27 20:36:13	ScruffyChat	So I took a look at the iris object and found that it wasn't just a 2 sided dome, it was actually a lopsided sphere
2016-04-27 20:37:23	ScruffyChat	So my new theory is that Bulborbs have two domes outside their eye (making it look like its lens has thickness) and a concave dome inside their eye
2016-04-27 20:37:59	ScruffyChat	I tried modelling it that way with the Spotty Bulbear and it ended up just how the irises are lit in the actual game
2016-04-27 20:38:29	ScruffyChat	So... it's a tiny nerdy detail, but very enjoyable discovering it
2016-04-27 20:40:13	ScruffyChat	Also I found out that the regular Bulborb texture is mapped almost identically to the Spotty Bulbear texture
2016-04-27 20:40:27	ScruffyChat	So you can make a Red Spotty Bulbear almost work perfectly
2016-04-27 20:40:57	Nvortex	you can actually see that the "iris" isn't a hole in-game
2016-04-27 20:41:14	ScruffyChat	?
2016-04-27 20:41:21	Nvortex	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/18/Bulbsnot.jpeg
2016-04-27 20:41:34	ScruffyChat	The iris is never a hole
2016-04-27 20:41:37	ScruffyChat	The pupil is
2016-04-27 20:41:49	Nvortex	i meant flat
2016-04-27 20:41:53	@Espyo	hah
2016-04-27 20:41:55	@Espyo	that's awesome
2016-04-27 20:42:05	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-04-27 20:42:27	ScruffyChat	But yes, Bulborbs have very convex lenses in this game, that's what you're seeing in that photo
2016-04-27 20:43:15	ScruffyChat	Which is not how human eyes are normally; human lenses normally fit perfectly with the curvature of the eye
2016-04-27 20:43:57	ScruffyChat	This guy must have serious astigmatism
2016-04-27 20:44:13	Nvortex	is there a way to see if the mireclops eye is the same as a bulborb?
2016-04-27 20:44:30	ScruffyChat	I have the Mireclops model, but only 6 minutes before the event
2016-04-27 20:44:33	@Espyo	dammit, I'll have dinner just about the same time it starts...

2016-04-27 20:45:54	ScruffyChat	Yes, they have the same eye structure!
2016-04-27 20:46:04	ScruffyChat	Nintendo really did its research

2016-04-27 20:49:59	Nvortex	"the eye mode of the mireclops is the same as the one on the bulborbs" or something lke that
2016-04-27 20:50:18	ScruffyChat	I guess, but they're only the same in lens structure

2016-04-27 20:51:07	ScruffyChat	They're both same structure

2016-04-27 20:51:48	Nvortex	sclera?
2016-04-27 20:51:48	ScruffyChat	The lens is the glass-looking dome that juts out from the eye
2016-04-27 20:51:57	Nvortex	oh cornea
2016-04-27 20:52:11	ScruffyChat	The iris is the colored section behind it
2016-04-27 20:52:25	@Espyo	if you can find a way to add it to the wiki, sure
2016-04-27 20:52:38	ScruffyChat	The lens is convex, but the iris is not
2016-04-27 20:53:35	ScruffyChat	the sclera is the white part surrounding the lens and iris; that's the part that's certainly different between Bulborbs and the Mireclops
2016-04-27 20:53:47	Nvortex	oh THAT
2016-04-27 20:53:53	Nvortex	it has a different name in spanish sorry
2016-04-27 20:53:59	Nvortex	thought it was the cornea
2016-04-27 20:54:02	ScruffyChat	heh no worries
2016-04-27 20:54:43	ScruffyChat	But the Red Bulborb and Mireclops even have the same iris color
2016-04-27 20:54:48	Nvortex	its called "crystalline" in spanish
2016-04-27 20:55:00	Nvortex	yeah that was why i asked if they were the same
2016-04-27 20:55:04	Nvortex	because of the iris
2016-04-27 20:55:08	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-04-27 20:55:26	ScruffyChat	Well yes, the structure of the Red Bulborb's lens and iris is the same as the Quaggled Mireclops
2016-04-27 20:55:56	ScruffyChat	Although the two don't use the same texture (the Mireclops has a darker iris texture), they are both blue irises with thick convex lenses

2016-04-27 20:58:21	ScruffyChat	and all the other grub-dogs have the same eye structure, just different iris colors and shapes
2016-04-27 20:58:55	Nvortex	wait how can you tell its convex
2016-04-27 20:58:57	--	slepi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-04-27 21:00:14	ScruffyChat	It juts out from the eye, and if we're assuming they went off of animal eye structures, most mammal eyes have biconvex lenses
2016-04-27 21:01:05	ScruffyChat	Now I'm figuring out more of these: the Skutterchuck has a layer around its eye
2016-04-27 21:01:11	ScruffyChat	Probably to make it look glossy
2016-04-27 21:01:18	Nvortex	yes but how can you tell its convex and not biconvex

2016-04-27 23:44:35	Nvortex	i searched for saya no uta CGs...
2016-04-27 23:44:46	Nvortex	i wish i hadn't toggled off the "Hide +18"
2016-04-27 23:44:59	Nvortex	the walkthrough i saw was censored
2016-04-27 23:45:06	Nvortex	its better that way
2016-04-28 00:01:27	ScruffyChat	Woah, interesting development
2016-04-28 00:02:12	ScruffyChat	in P2, kill an Armored Cannon Beetle Larva or Decorated Cannon Beetle, and as it's dying, pause the game
2016-04-28 00:02:19	@Espyo	yeha
2016-04-28 00:02:22	@Espyo	*yeah
2016-04-28 00:02:23	ScruffyChat	Its dying sound lasts a lot longer than the animation
2016-04-28 00:02:27	@Espyo	it's on the article
2016-04-28 00:02:31	ScruffyChat	oh
2016-04-28 00:02:32	@Espyo	and it's super weird-sounding too
2016-04-28 00:02:32	ScruffyChat	heh
2016-04-28 00:02:39	ScruffyChat	yeah, very gurgly
2016-04-28 00:03:07	@Espyo	how did you find this out?
2016-04-28 00:03:15	@Espyo	I remember I found out by some way that wasn't me playing it
2016-04-28 00:03:21	@Espyo	I was going to add it, but it was ALREADY there
2016-04-28 00:03:24	@Espyo	this was some years back
2016-04-28 00:03:29	@Espyo	so this information has been known for quite a while
2016-04-28 00:03:30	@Espyo	...somehow
2016-04-28 00:03:36	En_Passant	The sound itself isn't there, though
2016-04-28 00:03:59	@Espyo	hm, you're right
2016-04-28 00:04:03	@Espyo	it should probably be uploaded
2016-04-28 00:04:05	@Espyo	I'll do it tomorrow
2016-04-28 00:04:21	ScruffyChat	I just paused the game as one was dying, and by accident heard the sound
2016-04-28 00:04:29	@Espyo	wow
2016-04-28 00:04:36	@Espyo	see, this is what scares me about Pikmin 2
2016-04-28 00:04:44	@Espyo	what kind of insane things are hidden in plain sight, just like that?
2016-04-28 00:04:52	@Espyo	knowing this game, loads
2016-04-28 00:04:58	@Espyo	and there are probably loads we still haven't found
2016-04-28 00:05:21	@Espyo	well, going now
2016-04-28 00:05:22	@Espyo	night
2016-04-28 00:05:23	En_Passant	Reminds me of SA2 in a way

2016-04-28 00:05:26	ScruffyChat	night!

2016-04-28 00:13:31	ScruffyChat	Hey En_Passant, I've also gotten back into making Pikmin: Up Late
2016-04-28 00:14:03	ScruffyChat	I've been playing it all the way through so far, and it is completable, albeit more challenging, with invincible fire geysers
2016-04-28 00:14:10	ScruffyChat	but finally it makes Red Pikmin useful
2016-04-28 00:15:30	En_Passant	That's good
2016-04-28 00:15:42	Nvortex	>invincible fire geysers
2016-04-28 00:15:44	Nvortex	beautiful
2016-04-28 00:15:44	En_Passant	How far you?
2016-04-28 00:15:47	En_Passant	*far are you
2016-04-28 00:15:52	En_Passant	I can't seem to type today
2016-04-28 00:16:12	ScruffyChat	I've completed the Awakening Wood and am completing the Frontier Cavern currently
2016-04-28 00:16:32	ScruffyChat	Something goes weird when the Stellar Orb clashes with altered cave lighting, so I'll have to look into that
2016-04-28 00:16:43	ScruffyChat	Like, it makes shadows brighter, but the cave no less dark
2016-04-28 00:17:06	Nvortex	contrast orb
2016-04-28 00:17:25	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-04-28 00:17:44	ScruffyChat	This got me thinking, we need to complete the new treasure names
2016-04-28 00:18:40	En_Passant	oh yeah, that
2016-04-28 00:19:09	Nvortex	i wrote this in the thread
2016-04-28 00:19:10	Nvortex	Name all of the Duracell batteries to something that refers to their expiration dates, like "Outdated Reactor" "Useless Energy Cell" "Proton Decay" and "Empty Reservoir/Empty Fuel Reservoir" since the batteries expired almost 6 years ago
2016-04-28 00:19:33	ScruffyChat	Hehe, good thinking
2016-04-28 00:19:35	Nvortex	but you wanted the names to fit the character limit it had
2016-04-28 00:19:36	Nvortex	so...
2016-04-28 00:19:46	ScruffyChat	I'm sure we can find a way
2016-04-28 00:22:19	ScruffyChat	Here's the doc if you get any inspiration
2016-04-28 00:22:20	ScruffyChat	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2Vn4Yl2KuYJ10drzewND6Kzc7xp8gPdAcmbRkhnoUY/edit?ts=57214964
2016-04-28 00:24:28	Nvortex	oh my god, the dr pepper treasure has to be a S;G reference /PLEASE/
2016-04-28 00:24:52	ScruffyChat	Heh, if you can come up with a same-character reference
2016-04-28 00:24:52	En_Passant	S;G ?
2016-04-28 00:24:54	ScruffyChat	I don't know any
2016-04-28 00:24:57	Nvortex	Steins;Gate
2016-04-28 00:25:04	Nvortex	the favorite soda of the MC
2016-04-28 00:26:08	Nvortex	"the intellectual drink for the chosen ones"
2016-04-28 00:27:57	Nvortex	"flare cannon - neo's blaze"
2016-04-28 00:27:58	Nvortex	wat
2016-04-28 00:29:51	ScruffyChat	brb
2016-04-28 00:39:13	ScruffyChat	back
2016-04-28 00:41:08	En_Passant	Are you editing Olimar's notes, or just the Sales Pitches?
2016-04-28 00:41:20	ScruffyChat	I plan to edit everything
2016-04-28 00:41:27	ScruffyChat	But I may want to select just one, that's true
2016-04-28 00:42:20	Nvortex	i was thinking on a name for the drought ender and the shock terapist
2016-04-28 00:43:23	Nvortex	not even other S;G fans can fit a reference in 13 characters
2016-04-28 00:44:40	En_Passant	Somewhere in the Furious Adhesive, someone should suggest using it to coat the ship
2016-04-28 00:47:24	ScruffyChat	Good idea, noted
2016-04-28 00:48:48	En_Passant	Yeah, what's up with Flare Cannon? Did anyone agree on this?
2016-04-28 00:49:03	ScruffyChat	I don't know what that was
2016-04-28 00:49:37	ScruffyChat	It might have been Neocraftz's one
2016-04-28 00:50:03	En_Passant	Well, duh
2016-04-28 00:50:14	En_Passant	He probably added it without asking
2016-04-28 00:51:08	Nvortex	maybe the salivatrix could be a joke about the "fruit on the bottom"
2016-04-28 01:00:00	Nvortex	is it too offensive if i call the colosal fossil
2016-04-28 01:00:03	Nvortex	"No Way Grandpa?"
2016-04-28 01:00:28	ScruffyChat	I don't get it
2016-04-28 01:00:53	Nvortex	the skull of his dead grandfather
2016-04-28 01:01:09	ScruffyChat	Oh, I see
2016-04-28 01:01:42	ScruffyChat	You'd need a comma after no way or an exclamation point after grandpa to fully sell the joke, I think
2016-04-28 01:02:03	Nvortex	yeah but then its over the character limit, i better delete it
2016-04-28 01:08:17	Nvortex	why is the courage reactor "here comes cash"?
2016-04-28 01:08:23	Nvortex	because its worth a lot of pokos?
2016-04-28 01:08:39	Nvortex	or because tis the first treasure
2016-04-28 01:10:56	ScruffyChat	I think both, that was En_Passant's one
2016-04-28 01:12:03	En_Passant	It's worth a lot of Pokos?
2016-04-28 01:13:44	ScruffyChat	270, that's quite a bit
2016-04-28 01:16:56	Nvortex	and why is the silencer
2016-04-28 01:16:59	Nvortex	"joe."
2016-04-28 01:17:33	En_Passant	Why is the Chocolate Cushion "Olimar's New Home"?
2016-04-28 01:26:56	ScruffyChat	Who wouldn't want to live in a chocolate doughnut?
2016-04-28 01:27:05	ScruffyChat	But if you have any better ones, I'm all ears
2016-04-28 01:28:33	En_Passant	Police Distractor
2016-04-28 01:28:42	En_Passant	None of the other donuts fit the length
2016-04-28 01:31:10	ScruffyChat	Sure
2016-04-28 01:31:28	Nvortex	there's this number that is sometimes used as a joke in some nintendo games
2016-04-28 01:31:34	Nvortex	i dont know if its 255 or 256
2016-04-28 01:31:47	Nvortex	i want to name the "indomitable cpu" "surpasses 25X"
2016-04-28 01:32:05	En_Passant	256 is the number they use
2016-04-28 01:32:19	En_Passant	Because value 256 in 8-bit overflows to 0
2016-04-28 01:32:30	En_Passant	So I'd say 255 for the treasure name
2016-04-28 01:35:28	Nvortex	the list is missing the extraordinary bolt, i will add it
2016-04-28 01:36:20	Nvortex	...how do i addone more space again...
2016-04-28 01:38:08	En_Passant	Wait
2016-04-28 01:38:12	En_Passant	Isn't that a ship part?
2016-04-28 01:39:01	Nvortex	oh lol
2016-04-28 01:39:19	Nvortex	i meant the superstrong stabilizer which actually is there
2016-04-28 01:39:28	Nvortex	derp
2016-04-28 01:41:20	Nvortex	oh crap
2016-04-28 01:41:23	Nvortex	hello?
2016-04-28 01:41:31	ScruffyChat	Hi
2016-04-28 01:42:14	En_Passant	lol just thought of a dumb treasure
2016-04-28 01:42:26	ScruffyChat	Add it on, dumbness is welcomed here
2016-04-28 01:42:36	En_Passant	Not a name, an actual treasure
2016-04-28 01:42:50	Nvortex	i like the new name for the stabilizer
2016-04-28 01:42:56	En_Passant	thanks
2016-04-28 01:43:05	Nvortex	what kind of stuff i /cant/ write here?
2016-04-28 01:43:11	ScruffyChat	Oh, what's the treasure?
2016-04-28 01:43:18	Nvortex	obviously, other than swear words
2016-04-28 01:43:28	En_Passant	A fake moustache
2016-04-28 01:43:56	En_Passant	I was trying to decide what would be a good Scruffy's treasure, and thought about how none of them have facial hair
2016-04-28 01:44:33	Nvortex	the wiggle noggin has a mustache
2016-04-28 01:44:39	Nvortex	painted on but it's a mustache
2016-04-28 01:45:07	ScruffyChat	Nvortex: no profanity or things you feel might offend other people
2016-04-28 01:45:34	En_Passant	then it is decided
2016-04-28 01:46:11	ScruffyChat	All of the dialogue I've rewritten so far has been clean humor, just really off-the-wall and not helpful to gameplay in the slightest
2016-04-28 01:46:20	Nvortex	ok
2016-04-28 01:46:22	ScruffyChat	I also love writing puns, so prepare for puns if you hate 'em
2016-04-28 01:46:30	Nvortex	what happens if treasure names don't really make sense?
2016-04-28 01:46:35	Nvortex	as in what they are
2016-04-28 01:46:48	ScruffyChat	Then Olimar has to try and make sense of them in his notes

2016-04-28 04:20:27	ScruffyChat	I don't know
2016-04-28 04:20:34	ScruffyChat	I have in the Night Mode so far
2016-04-28 04:20:39	ScruffyChat	And it's interesting
2016-04-28 04:21:06	ScruffyChat	It seems like too much, but it also feels like there's an obligation to use up Candypop Buds that you start
2016-04-28 04:21:21	ScruffyChat	So I end up avoiding a lot of Candypop Buds
2016-04-28 04:22:18	En_Passant	Are most of those Violet/Ivory?
2016-04-28 04:22:50	ScruffyChat	yes
2016-04-28 04:23:43	En_Passant	That might explain it. It also makes the situation different from V, where there aren't Candypop exclusives

2016-04-28 19:51:33	Scruffy	Once we're given the grading sheet, we'll use that as reference for the grade we give
2016-04-28 19:51:36	Marty2000	Oh no problem
2016-04-28 19:52:37	@Espyo	the final one?
2016-04-28 19:52:45	@Espyo	so we only really write down ONE value?
2016-04-28 19:52:56	@Espyo	I thought we had to grade everything, from the presentation to the research done
2016-04-28 19:53:13	Yoshi2	why are you guys involved in grading?
2016-04-28 19:53:26	@Espyo	it's just part of it
2016-04-28 19:54:04	Scruffy	I think it'll still be separate values for each criterion, but it'll add up to one value
2016-04-28 19:54:11	Scruffy	That's how my thesis went, anywya
2016-04-28 19:54:27	@Espyo	I can't find any place to put any score anywhere, except for the final one
2016-04-28 19:54:57	Scruffy	Well that's not the grading sheet yet, just the reference for what our numbers will mean when we fill out the real sheet
2016-04-28 19:55:09	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-28 19:55:16	@Espyo	that explains it then

2016-04-29 18:55:27	Testyo	so they just want to replace text with an image saying the whole show to play out

2016-04-29 19:08:24	Marty2000	Hi UltraMario
2016-04-29 19:08:34	UltraMario	hiya
2016-04-29 19:08:37	ScruffyChat	Espyo, any grading sheet yet?
2016-04-29 19:08:41	ScruffyChat	I haven't gotten one
2016-04-29 19:08:44	@Espyo	nothing yet
2016-04-29 19:08:56	UltraMario	been reading tcrf lately
2016-04-29 19:09:06	UltraMario	it's a cool site, i'd recommend it
2016-04-29 19:09:07	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-29 19:09:36	@Espyo	of course it is
2016-04-29 19:11:10	UltraMario	yup
2016-04-29 19:11:28	UltraMario	beta stuff is interesting to me
2016-04-29 19:11:45	ScruffyChat	It's amazing how much games keep
2016-04-29 19:12:37	Marty2000	Yep, it's cool to see the beta elements
2016-04-29 19:13:53	UltraMario	yeah
2016-04-29 19:14:53	UltraMario	also, i never noticed how different the special movie in melee when i was younger
2016-04-29 19:15:13	UltraMario	it has some subtle differences from the final

2016-04-29 19:15:43	@Espyo	what is he, a 10 year old?
2016-04-29 19:17:18	ScruffyChat	I don't even see what the big deal is
2016-04-29 19:17:28	ScruffyChat	I say Nintendo should take its time with P4
2016-04-29 19:18:09	ScruffyChat	I mean they said it was very close to completion but maybe now they're realizing they don't want it to be another Pikmin 3 time crunch to complete the finishing touches
2016-04-29 19:18:38	ScruffyChat	The more effort the better, even if I have to get an NX I will to play a PIkmin game
2016-04-29 19:19:59	Marty2000	I agree. Pikmin 3 is a very good game (for me), although I have found the story mode quite short
2016-04-29 19:20:51	ScruffyChat	Right, and there are some issues (like sequence breaking) that probably could have been avoided with more time to test it
2016-04-29 19:21:25	ScruffyChat	Although honestly, the sequence break secrets actually make it kind of better for me
2016-04-29 19:21:28	ScruffyChat	:P
2016-04-29 19:22:44	Marty2000	I actually like finding out glitches too : I would say it adds things to do in the game (even though it's not intended)
2016-04-29 19:23:01	ScruffyChat	Right

2016-04-29 19:29:53	UltraMario	have you played the original melee?
2016-04-29 19:29:57	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-04-29 19:29:58	Marty2000	No
2016-04-29 19:30:03	UltraMario	sad
2016-04-29 19:30:07	UltraMario	it's gr8
2016-04-29 19:30:07	Marty2000	But I've already watched videos of it
2016-04-29 19:30:12	UltraMario	loved it as a kid
2016-04-29 19:30:14	UltraMario	:o
2016-04-29 19:31:11	Marty2000	I was too young to play it when it was released, and I have never found it :/
2016-04-29 19:31:24	Marty2000	But it looks great indeed
2016-04-29 19:31:40	UltraMario	ah
2016-04-29 19:31:51	UltraMario	im guessing you have a gamecube?
2016-04-29 19:32:15	Marty2000	Well, I had one
2016-04-29 19:32:21	UltraMario	oh
2016-04-29 19:32:21	UltraMario	rip
2016-04-29 19:32:22	Marty2000	I could buy one at a very little price
2016-04-29 19:32:23	UltraMario	:p
2016-04-29 19:32:28	UltraMario	true
2016-04-29 19:32:31	Marty2000	But it worked during...
2016-04-29 19:32:35	UltraMario	what about a wii
2016-04-29 19:32:36	Marty2000	3 little days
2016-04-29 19:32:44	Marty2000	I have a Wii
2016-04-29 19:32:48	UltraMario	nice
2016-04-29 19:33:11	UltraMario	yeah, melee copies are kinda high-priced, surprisingly
2016-04-29 19:34:08	Marty2000	Probably because it's a famous game that many people look for
2016-04-29 19:37:17	UltraMario	yup

2016-04-29 20:02:16	Marty2000	I can count 20 in the NPC version. Is it a difference between the versions or a mistake in the article?
2016-04-29 20:02:35	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fire_geyser I'm adding the locations here, I've nearly finished
2016-04-29 20:03:00	Marty2000	(I'm talking about the fire geyser, sorry)
2016-04-29 20:03:04	Marty2000	geysers*
2016-04-29 20:03:09	@Espyo	hmm
2016-04-29 20:03:17	@Espyo	see, the problem is the numbers are crazy
2016-04-29 20:03:20	@Espyo	so they're likely wrong
2016-04-29 20:03:35	@Espyo	still, 20 fire geysers? that's a bit insane
2016-04-29 20:03:55	Marty2000	Want me to reset to reverify?
2016-04-29 20:04:25	@Espyo	https://tcrf.net/User_talk:GoldS#Just_a_Pikmin_2_question :(
2016-04-29 20:04:33	@Espyo	well, if you don't mind
2016-04-29 20:04:42	Marty2000	Sure, I'll do
2016-04-29 20:04:43	@Espyo	but I think that one day we'll figure out exactly what the game means with all these numbers
2016-04-29 20:04:48	@Espyo	and we'll finally have an objective answer
2016-04-29 20:04:55	@Espyo	without the need to go double check this and that
2016-04-29 20:06:13	Marty2000	It's 21
2016-04-29 20:06:15	Marty2000	(now)
2016-04-29 20:06:27	@Espyo	wow
2016-04-29 20:06:32	@Espyo	could be a console difference
2016-04-29 20:06:47	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OARs3BBBw-Y I'm going to test this, so I'll take the chance and check DD5 as well

2016-04-29 20:07:02	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Frontier_Cavern#Sublevel_1 Like this with the plants
2016-04-29 20:07:03	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-29 20:07:30	@Espyo	can I go in with just one Purple?
2016-04-29 20:07:33	@Espyo	don't feel like managing a large army
2016-04-29 20:08:20	Marty2000	Hmm
2016-04-29 20:08:23	Marty2000	There's a clog

2016-04-29 20:08:28	Marty2000	:/
2016-04-29 20:08:37	@Espyo	thanks game
2016-04-29 20:08:40	@Espyo	all right, I'll bring more...
2016-04-29 20:08:56	Marty2000	I brought 5 Pikmin and used an Ultra Spicy Spray
2016-04-29 20:09:00	Marty2000	It's rather fast
2016-04-29 20:12:24	@Espyo	ok, that's a lot of geysers
2016-04-29 20:12:25	@Espyo	easily more than 2
2016-04-29 20:12:28	@Espyo	*more than 3
2016-04-29 20:12:42	Marty2000	So that's a mistake 
2016-04-29 20:12:47	Marty2000	(article)
2016-04-29 20:12:59	@Espyo	well, yeah
2016-04-29 20:13:03	@Espyo	but there is no real number
2016-04-29 20:13:07	@Espyo	that's what makes all of these numbers so bad
2016-04-29 20:13:15	@Espyo	but it's definitely more than 3
2016-04-29 20:13:22	@Espyo	feel free to fix it how you see fit, I guess
2016-04-29 20:13:35	Marty2000	I'll reset a last time
2016-04-29 20:14:05	Marty2000	But now, I don't know if I should add the numbers here http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fire_geyser
2016-04-29 20:14:11	Marty2000	If there are mistakes.... :/
2016-04-29 20:14:46	@Espyo	yeah, it's complicated
2016-04-29 20:14:49	@Espyo	but you can probably add them
2016-04-29 20:14:51	@Espyo	better than nothing
2016-04-29 20:14:59	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-29 20:15:23	@Espyo	hm
2016-04-29 20:15:27	@Espyo	so I recreated the glitch
2016-04-29 20:15:45	@Espyo	but it assumed I chose to leave the cave, after some seconds
2016-04-29 20:15:46	Marty2000	(22 this time... lol)
2016-04-29 20:15:47	@Espyo	without me doing it
2016-04-29 20:15:51	@Espyo	yeah, see, the numbers are dumb
2016-04-29 20:15:54	Marty2000	That's new glitch is cool
2016-04-29 20:16:05	Marty2000	Well, guess I'll have to reset 
2016-04-29 20:16:08	@Espyo	yeah, also apparently frame-perfect
2016-04-29 20:16:34	Marty2000	I dunno if it's possible to reproduce it on the NPC version
2016-04-29 20:16:55	Marty2000	I'll try it whenever possible
2016-04-29 20:17:35	@Espyo	yeah, it's frame-perfect
2016-04-29 20:17:39	@Espyo	good luck...
2016-04-29 20:17:50	@Espyo	actually, I think it'd be easier for me to check here
2016-04-29 20:17:54	@Espyo	yeah, I'll do that
2016-04-29 20:17:55	@Espyo	don't bother
2016-04-29 20:17:58	@Espyo	otherwise you'll take forever
2016-04-29 20:18:03	@Espyo	if it even DOES work
2016-04-29 20:18:04	Marty2000	Ok,thanks
2016-04-29 20:18:07	@Espyo	if not, you'll waste a lot of time
2016-04-29 20:18:19	Marty2000	Now I have 20 geysers
2016-04-29 20:18:37	Marty2000	I think it's random but always above 20...
2016-04-29 20:18:52	@Espyo	right
2016-04-29 20:19:20	Marty2000	I think we should add something like "over 20"
2016-04-29 20:19:24	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-29 20:19:40	Marty2000	Well, I'll modify
2016-04-29 20:20:15	@Espyo	uhm
2016-04-29 20:20:16	Marty2000	It reminds me a challenge mode article I modified a week ago
2016-04-29 20:20:20	@Espyo	if you lie down with this glitch
2016-04-29 20:20:24	@Espyo	you're actually floating a bit above ground
2016-04-29 20:20:25	Marty2000	Yes?
2016-04-29 20:20:31	@Espyo	and since I'm on Dream Den 5, I can walk off
2016-04-29 20:20:34	@Espyo	let's see what happens!
2016-04-29 20:20:40	Marty2000	Hmm... strange
2016-04-29 20:20:43	Marty2000	But seems cool!
2016-04-29 20:21:25	@Espyo	I just respawned
2016-04-29 20:21:28	@Espyo	I'll try to fall and lie down
2016-04-29 20:21:31	@Espyo	for the stuck leader glitch
2016-04-29 20:22:33	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-29 20:24:35	@Espyo	but yeah, here's a PROTIP for you all
2016-04-29 20:24:39	@Espyo	if you're hunting for glitches
2016-04-29 20:24:42	@Espyo	do stuff like this
2016-04-29 20:24:54	@Espyo	enter or exit a menu or cutscene or what have you at the same time you get a cutscene or menu or something
2016-04-29 20:24:59	@Espyo	chances are the game will not handle it gracefully

2016-04-29 20:33:44	@Espyo	heh
2016-04-29 20:34:22	@Espyo	...Pikmin 2 is so dumb with its Pikmin count
2016-04-29 20:34:29	@Espyo	it's so eager to say a Pikmin is in your group
2016-04-29 20:34:36	@Espyo	if you throw a Pikmin, it only updates AFTER the Pikmin touches the ground
2016-04-29 20:34:42	Marty2000	Yep
2016-04-29 20:34:43	@Espyo	and if the Pikmin is on fire, it still counts as being in your group
2016-04-29 20:34:57	Marty2000	Same if you use the move group normally

2016-04-29 20:41:11	Marty2000	Oh
2016-04-29 20:41:19	Marty2000	In Pikmin 2,
2016-04-29 20:41:27	Marty2000	When the Pikmin latch on to an enemy
2016-04-29 20:41:33	Marty2000	And that enemy is falling into the abyss
2016-04-29 20:41:45	Marty2000	The Pikmin will actually respawn above the abyss
2016-04-29 20:41:52	@Espyo	hah
2016-04-29 20:41:54	@Espyo	that makes sense
2016-04-29 20:41:54	Marty2000	Before falling and dying too
2016-04-29 20:42:01	@Espyo	well, some sense
2016-04-29 20:42:09	@Espyo	the Pikmin themselves don't touch the abyss
2016-04-29 20:42:18	@Espyo	they're above the enemy when it touches the death plane
2016-04-29 20:42:27	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-29 20:42:28	@Espyo	but I guess because the object it was latched on to vanished, it teleports above

2016-04-29 20:43:13	Marty2000	I guess it didn't fall here because the hitbox is too big, isn't it?
2016-04-29 20:44:05	@Espyo	hm, that could likely be it
2016-04-29 20:44:44	Marty2000	Another thing : you can throw Yellow Pikmin higher with fire geysers

2016-04-29 21:11:19	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-29 21:11:41	@Espyo	recounted, got 11
2016-04-29 21:13:02	Marty2000	White Pikmin in p1?
2016-04-29 21:13:15	@Espyo	sorry, P2

2016-04-29 21:13:39	@Espyo	but it could just be a miscount
2016-04-29 21:13:51	Marty2000	So seems they all fall faster in the NPC version
2016-04-29 21:13:56	@Espyo	well, looks like the conclusion is that flower Pikmin take longer to fall on the GameCube
2016-04-29 21:14:04	Yoshi2	Espyo: I heard with many keyboards ghosting (the thing where you can't hold down some key combinations at once) is still an issue
2016-04-29 21:14:23	@Espyo	I know some keyboards DON'T have that
2016-04-29 21:14:32	@Espyo	but it's the kind of thing I'd actually have to go out of my way to check
2016-04-29 21:14:35	@Espyo	like
2016-04-29 21:14:41	@Espyo	search on google for a list of brands or something
2016-04-29 21:14:53	@Espyo	I wouldn't mind if the reality was "some keyboards do and some don't"

2016-04-29 21:15:27	@Espyo	I didn't check P1, since the NPCP1 ISO I have is a weird format
2016-04-29 21:15:31	@Espyo	which is weird, since it worked fine on windows 7
2016-04-29 21:15:38	@Espyo	maybe I passed the wrong file

2016-04-29 21:16:40	@Espyo	no, no frame count
2016-04-29 21:16:52	@Espyo	it was based on my subjective (but I want to believe — scientifically accurate) judgements
2016-04-29 21:17:06	Marty2000	Okay

2016-04-29 21:41:42	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-29 21:41:45	@Espyo	but basically, because of the flexible terrain, it sometimes glitches
2016-04-29 21:41:51	@Espyo	and it actually places your cursor on the bottomless pit
2016-04-29 21:42:02	Marty2000	Oh, that makes sense
2016-04-29 21:42:10	@Espyo	so when you throw, it tries to make the entire trajectory of ground level -> high -> REALLY LOW in the same time
2016-04-29 21:42:18	@Espyo	and for that distance, it needs a short amount of time

2016-04-29 21:42:58	Marty2000	By holding on to a leader or Pikmin while on the Sandbelching Meerslug's arena and walking about, the trajectory prediction curve will occasionally change to a tight curve with an endpoint far below the surface. At this point, throwing will result in the leader or Pikmin to perform their trajectory very quickly. This is likely because the game adjusts the thr

2016-04-29 21:59:12	Marty2000	Proabbly
2016-04-29 21:59:13	@Espyo	<Espyo> no need
2016-04-29 21:59:13	@Espyo	<Espyo> they're useful for plants, not so much for common things like forks
2016-04-29 21:59:30	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-29 21:59:37	@Espyo	if you have a plant, readers might want to know "oh yeah, what makes you so sure it's that breed?"
2016-04-29 21:59:48	@Espyo	and they can use an image to compare the shape of the leafs, the colors, etc.
2016-04-29 21:59:58	@Espyo	but for something like a simple shovel, I really don't think anybody cares
2016-04-29 22:00:16	@Espyo	plus the article already has so many images, that any excuse not to add more is fine
2016-04-29 22:00:25	Marty2000	That's true

2016-04-29 22:06:53	Marty2000	And a brief description

2016-04-29 22:24:02	@Espyo	it's just a generic tower, honestly
2016-04-29 22:24:35	Marty2000	Yes, of course
2016-04-29 22:24:44	Marty2000	But the coincidence is just "funny"
2016-04-29 22:24:56	Marty2000	It was probably not intended

2016-04-29 23:05:49	@Espyo	ok...
2016-04-29 23:05:53	@Espyo	so I just learned that:
2016-04-29 23:06:10	@Espyo	a) when you want to see a difference on MediaWiki, you don't need the index.php part of the URL
2016-04-29 23:06:21	@Espyo	b) when you're seeing a difference, the oldid parameter on the URL does nothing
2016-04-29 23:06:36	@Espyo	and c) if you provide the curid, that already identifies the page, so the page's name on the URL is pointless
2016-04-29 23:06:41	@Espyo	meaning I can remove those 3 things
2016-04-29 23:06:48	@Espyo	meaning Testyo's recent change report URLs can be a LOT shorter
2016-04-29 23:06:48	Testyo	same for Olimar's Journal, by the looks of it can't reach me
2016-04-29 23:08:33	<--	Testyo (Testyo@37.189.nry.mz) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-04-29 23:08:44	@Espyo	I'm pretty stoked about this change

2016-04-29 23:09:01	Testyo	Hi everyone!
2016-04-29 23:09:51	Marty2000	I don't really know much information about how these things work, but seems good if you can make changes :-)
2016-04-29 23:10:33	@Espyo	currently, some of Testyo's messages take up three lines on my HexChat
2016-04-29 23:10:34	Testyo	I need to be able to help people when they need it
2016-04-29 23:10:38	@Espyo	with this change, they'll surely go down to two
2016-04-29 23:10:56	@Espyo	for reference, the last change he reported before I killed him was with this URL: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Marty/Decoration&curid=20470&diff=163298&oldid=163297
2016-04-29 23:11:06	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=20470&diff=163297 this URL does the exact same thing
2016-04-29 23:11:09	@Espyo	and look how much smaller it is!
2016-04-29 23:11:31	@Espyo	now we need to make some changes so Testyo can report them
2016-04-29 23:11:31	Testyo	I suppose it only really causes any problems if there's a lot of disk activity and you're a lot of stuff
2016-04-29 23:11:32	@Espyo	but not yet
2016-04-29 23:11:39	@Espyo	first, he goes through 5 minutes before fetching the first changes
2016-04-29 23:11:48	@Espyo	then, he uses those as a basis to get some context
2016-04-29 23:12:03	@Espyo	and only after the next 5 minutes will he fetch other changes, and report them if they're different from the ones he knows
2016-04-29 23:12:06	@Espyo	so we'll need to wait a bit

2016-04-29 23:26:26	@Espyo	I was wondering why Testyo wasn't reporting my changes
2016-04-29 23:26:26	Testyo	and i've got about some custom engine which has pikmin in it?
2016-04-29 23:26:39	@Espyo	and then I realized it's literally because he's not meant to report mine
2016-04-29 23:26:42	@Espyo	can you make a change, Marty?
2016-04-29 23:26:43	@Espyo	anywhere

2016-04-29 23:33:40	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Telescoping_Pumphog this works
2016-04-29 23:33:49	@Espyo	just use Pikan to find ideas for a change
2016-04-29 23:33:57	@Espyo	I need to test a change I made on Testyo's recent change reports

2016-04-29 23:34:09	ScruffyChat	ight
2016-04-29 23:34:11	ScruffyChat	right*
2016-04-29 23:34:21	ScruffyChat	It tells me to add a "See also" section
2016-04-29 23:34:41	@Espyo	yeah, all articles are meant to have a See also section
2016-04-29 23:34:46	@Espyo	but you can probably pick a different, simpler problem
2016-04-29 23:34:49	@Espyo	honestly, any change works
2016-04-29 23:34:54	Marty2000	Oh sorry
2016-04-29 23:34:59	Marty2000	I'm going to make a change
2016-04-29 23:34:59	@Espyo	it's just that we can as well make the change worthwhile :V
2016-04-29 23:35:04	@Espyo	it's all right, Marty
2016-04-29 23:35:10	@Espyo	yeah, any number of changes greater than 0 works
2016-04-29 23:35:11	@Espyo	so feel free
2016-04-29 23:35:26	ScruffyChat	Ok, I made the first mention of the name bold
2016-04-29 23:35:47	@Espyo	that works

2016-04-29 23:36:48	ScruffyChat	Testyo lm
2016-04-29 23:36:48	Testyo	I said But the Red Bulborb has a radius of 40.00, so that its whole body is off-screen before it is messing up this island from which Onions come because Espyo mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages But the Red Bulborb has a radius of 40.00, so that its whole body is off-screen before it disappears and which means it is messing up this island from which Onions come.

2016-04-30 01:52:56	ScruffyChat	Hi En_Passant!
2016-04-30 01:54:15	En_Passant	hi
2016-04-30 01:54:34	En_Passant	I'm learning to stream so I can speedrun
2016-04-30 01:54:38	ScruffyChat	Oooh
2016-04-30 01:54:45	ScruffyChat	Nice! I'd love to watch
2016-04-30 01:54:47	En_Passant	Except I'm really bad without a controller
2016-04-30 01:54:51	ScruffyChat	I need to learn that too
2016-04-30 01:54:56	ScruffyChat	Heh
2016-04-30 01:55:04	ScruffyChat	You get used to it after a while
2016-04-30 01:55:13	En_Passant	I want to get one of those GC to Wii U/PC adapters
2016-04-30 01:55:18	En_Passant	It's only $20 or so
2016-04-30 01:55:25	En_Passant	Works on four controllers at once, too
2016-04-30 01:55:27	ScruffyChat	The main problem is there's no analog signal to i
2016-04-30 01:55:29	ScruffyChat	Wow
2016-04-30 01:55:51	ScruffyChat	Oh, just to let you know, Espyo and I still haven't received grade sheets
2016-04-30 01:56:05	En_Passant	Did you get what I sent you?
2016-04-30 01:56:12	ScruffyChat	The rubric? Yes
2016-04-30 01:56:21	En_Passant	That's the grade sheet
2016-04-30 01:56:34	ScruffyChat	Ohhh
2016-04-30 01:56:56	ScruffyChat	Now I see
2016-04-30 01:57:12	ScruffyChat	So you'd rather we fill this out in handwriting?
2016-04-30 01:57:22	ScruffyChat	I do have an electric pen that I could fill it out with
2016-04-30 01:57:23	En_Passant	No preference
2016-04-30 01:57:41	En_Passant	You could open it in Word and highlight what you think fits
2016-04-30 01:57:49	En_Passant	if you wanted to
2016-04-30 01:58:11	En_Passant	don't tell me he sent you those like he said and you guys didn't realize it
2016-04-30 01:58:53	ScruffyChat	I haven't received anything from anyone besides you
2016-04-30 01:59:00	ScruffyChat	Regarding this project, anyway
2016-04-30 01:59:10	En_Passant	okay
2016-04-30 01:59:30	ScruffyChat	But sorry I hadn't noticed what this was, I'll fill it out right away
2016-04-30 01:59:39	ScruffyChat	And then email it to you?
2016-04-30 02:00:03	En_Passant	To me or to him
2016-04-30 02:00:09	ScruffyChat	Okay
2016-04-30 02:12:09	ScruffyChat	By the way, what will you be speedrunning?
2016-04-30 02:19:14	En_Passant	Sonic Adventure 2
2016-04-30 02:19:49	ScruffyChat	Nice choice

2016-04-30 02:49:14	ScruffyChat	En_Passant
2016-04-30 02:49:19	ScruffyChat	I just sent you the rubric
2016-04-30 02:50:15	ScruffyChat	For some reason Gmail didn't like me trying to send it to your teacher
2016-04-30 02:51:20	ScruffyChat	Maybe that's why I haven't received anything from him

2016-04-30 14:34:29	Testyo	You're using quite the colorful words, aren't you?
2016-04-30 14:34:52	Klemen702	that is weird and stupid
2016-04-30 14:37:58	Marty2000	Testyo, you shouldn't speak of those "colorful" words... We all know you say those when you can ;)
2016-04-30 14:37:59	Testyo	for Challenge Mode, it's starting to swerve that way
2016-04-30 14:38:14	Klemen702	i guess that's a no
2016-04-30 14:38:19	Klemen702	for me
2016-04-30 14:38:25	Marty2000	Remember, Klemen702?

2016-04-30 14:39:01	Klemen702	so
2016-04-30 14:39:05	Klemen702	we pingd testyo
2016-04-30 14:39:05	Testyo	only Brittany's European version of the notes
2016-04-30 14:39:09	Klemen702	and now testyo pinged espyo
2016-04-30 14:39:09	Testyo	heh Pikmin 1 uses that go unused in SMS
2016-04-30 14:39:12	Klemen702	nice chain reaction

2016-04-30 14:45:48	Marty2000	How does it work?
2016-04-30 14:46:28	@Espyo	it would work if I opened the ports on my router
2016-04-30 14:46:35	@Espyo	but it's acting up, so they'll come today to fix it
2016-04-30 14:46:48	@Espyo	I switched ISPs recently
2016-04-30 14:46:51	Marty2000	Oh ok
2016-04-30 14:46:58	@Espyo	and we keep getting connection problems, so they probably didn't set it up right
2016-04-30 14:47:11	@Espyo	only after they ACTUALLY fix EVERYTHING will I be bothered to go to my router and allow Testyo's pages to go through
2016-04-30 14:47:11	Testyo	any modern visual studio needs like medicine
2016-04-30 14:47:27	@Espyo	I could do it now, but if they decide the router is broken or something and take it back, my work will be for nothing
2016-04-30 14:47:44	@Espyo	it's not a lot of work, but it's cumbersome to have to physically go to where my router is with a laptop and such :|
2016-04-30 14:47:46	Marty2000	Don't bother, that's okay. I just asked ;)

2016-04-30 14:59:55	Marty2000	"Plus other changes, omitted due to flooding." The message changed too. I find it better
2016-04-30 15:00:49	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-04-30 15:01:02	@Espyo	it's a bit smaller than the old message
2016-04-30 15:01:10	Marty2000	The other was good too, but when there were MANY changes, it actually "contributed" to the flood
2016-04-30 15:01:18	Marty2000	Well, that's what I think
2016-04-30 15:01:24	@Espyo	hehehe yeah
2016-04-30 15:02:05	Marty2000	By the way, it seems Testyo only reports the three last changes. Didn't he report the first three changes beforehand?
2016-04-30 15:02:05	Testyo	STOP DOING THINGS I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE NAME
2016-04-30 15:02:25	Marty2000	Wouldn't he*

2016-04-30 15:03:13	@Espyo	>Plus other changes, omitted due to flooding.
2016-04-30 15:03:18	@Espyo	yeah, it's a bit of a hefty difference...
2016-04-30 15:03:22	@Espyo	I never really compared the two
2016-04-30 15:03:28	@Espyo	I just deleted the old one and tried re-writing from scratch
2016-04-30 15:03:39	@Espyo	I don't think so
2016-04-30 15:03:44	@Espyo	I didn't change the way he reads them
2016-04-30 15:03:57	@Espyo	I only changed the URL he prints out, and the "and more" message
2016-04-30 15:04:00	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-30 15:04:13	@Espyo	this got me thinking
2016-04-30 15:04:19	@Espyo	sometimes, when writing stuff like policies and such
2016-04-30 15:04:25	@Espyo	it's useful to minimize your text
2016-04-30 15:04:42	@Espyo	replace some expressions with some other expressions that mean the same, but save up on space
2016-04-30 15:04:51	@Espyo	let me try it with the message I just wrote
2016-04-30 15:04:55	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-30 15:05:06	@Espyo	>replace expressions with similar ones to save space
2016-04-30 15:05:13	@Espyo	well
2016-04-30 15:05:16	@Espyo	that's half as much reading
2016-04-30 15:05:23	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-30 15:05:31	Marty2000	I'll try to remember
2016-04-30 15:05:32	@Espyo	doing this on something like a policy or an article can make a world of difference
2016-04-30 15:05:41	@Espyo	oh, I'm not trying to say what you write is long
2016-04-30 15:05:45	@Espyo	I'm just speaking in general, for everybody
2016-04-30 15:05:50	Marty2000	Yes sure
2016-04-30 15:05:53	@Espyo	I was actually thinking about how I should improve on this myself
2016-04-30 15:06:02	Marty2000	But I tend to use lot of text too
2016-04-30 15:06:02	@Espyo	since I sometimes type stuff and realize it could be shorter
2016-04-30 15:06:09	@Espyo	yeah, I guess it's just natural
2016-04-30 15:06:12	@Espyo	but this got me thinking
2016-04-30 15:06:22	@Espyo	what if there's some site out there that suggests replacements like this?
2016-04-30 15:06:34	@Espyo	there are a lot of common expressions that can be replaced with shorter versions
2016-04-30 15:06:46	@Espyo	and now I'm wondering, maybe J knows of some site like that
2016-04-30 15:06:56	@Espyo	if not, I'm REALLY tempted to make my own
2016-04-30 15:06:59	@Espyo	but I wouldn't know how to start
2016-04-30 15:07:06	@Espyo	but I think it would be amazing
2016-04-30 15:07:13	Marty2000	Oh, yes
2016-04-30 15:07:18	@Espyo	for people wanting to write a message to fit on twitter
2016-04-30 15:07:18	Marty2000	Would be cool
2016-04-30 15:07:28	@Espyo	for students wanting to write an essay but are using too many words
2016-04-30 15:07:39	@Espyo	for writers trying to write an article but not overburden the reader with text that's too long
2016-04-30 15:07:42	@Espyo	oh, I can see it now...
2016-04-30 15:07:51	@Espyo	no way, there HAS to be a site like this already
2016-04-30 15:07:52	@Espyo	or a program
2016-04-30 15:07:54	@Espyo	or something
2016-04-30 15:08:04	@Espyo	but see, I tried searching in the past
2016-04-30 15:08:06	@Espyo	but didn't find anything
2016-04-30 15:08:16	@Espyo	I'll ask around
2016-04-30 15:08:23	@Espyo	maybe somebody actually knows of such a service

2016-04-30 15:13:22	@Espyo	yeah...

2016-04-30 15:13:40	@Espyo	I couldn't even find many tips as is
2016-04-30 15:13:52	@Espyo	although I did once find a PDF file with a list of the most common ones
2016-04-30 15:13:55	@Espyo	but other than that, not much
2016-04-30 15:17:32	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlHuzIv_g :|
2016-04-30 15:17:55	@Espyo	https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHlIy3XA-w huh? this one's weird
2016-04-30 15:18:01	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-04-30 15:18:20	Marty2000	I wonder what happened to the Rock Pikmin
2016-04-30 15:18:29	@Espyo	he says it's invisible, but
2016-04-30 15:18:31	@Espyo	I can see the flower

2016-04-30 15:18:36	@Espyo	and I can't tell if I can see the actual Rock Pikmin or not
2016-04-30 15:19:03	Marty2000	Maybe he skipped the Iron Ball (Yellows skip) and
2016-04-30 15:19:08	Marty2000	he reentered the cave
2016-04-30 15:19:18	Marty2000	When you do so, if you have many Pikmin, they get stuck
2016-04-30 15:19:24	Marty2000	And if you push the Iron Ball
2016-04-30 15:19:30	Marty2000	They get crushed
2016-04-30 15:19:36	Marty2000	Ecept for the Rock Pikmin
2016-04-30 15:19:39	Klemen702	wait
2016-04-30 15:19:44	Marty2000	except*
2016-04-30 15:19:45	Klemen702	they can push a whole ball of iron
2016-04-30 15:19:51	Klemen702	u sure it's not rock
2016-04-30 15:19:53	Klemen702	a boulder
2016-04-30 15:19:54	Klemen702	or some shit
2016-04-30 15:20:12	Marty2000	I though it was an Iron Ball
2016-04-30 15:20:13	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-04-30 15:20:18	Marty2000	thought*
2016-04-30 15:20:31	@Espyo	but it is an iron ball
2016-04-30 15:20:46	Klemen702	confirm
2016-04-30 15:21:04	Marty2000	By the way
2016-04-30 15:21:12	@Espyo	hm, maybe, but why would that make the Rock invisible?
2016-04-30 15:21:13	Marty2000	If you skip the Yellows
2016-04-30 15:21:26	Marty2000	And do not activate their cutscene (it's possible)
2016-04-30 15:21:36	Marty2000	This will make the whistle unusable for the rest of the day
2016-04-30 15:21:41	Marty2000	for both Brittany and Alph
2016-04-30 15:22:06	Marty2000	But it's still possible to whistle a little by holding a Pikmin and activating the whistle
2016-04-30 15:22:47	@Espyo	wow
2016-04-30 15:23:18	@Espyo	that can probably be added to [[Glitches in Pikmin 3#Yellow Onion skip]]

2016-04-30 15:23:21	@Espyo	as like a note or something
2016-04-30 15:23:21	Marty2000	I haven't made a video about this
2016-04-30 15:23:25	Marty2000	But I probably should
2016-04-30 15:23:36	Marty2000	Okay, I'm going to add this
2016-04-30 15:23:40	@Espyo	all right

2016-04-30 15:26:32	Marty2000	I wonder if it's not because of Brittany's spacesuit
2016-04-30 15:26:40	Marty2000	And the KopPad's flash
2016-04-30 15:26:46	Marty2000	Oh
2016-04-30 15:26:50	@Espyo	no, they just seem spicy to me
2016-04-30 15:26:52	Marty2000	It's SPicy Spray, of course
2016-04-30 15:26:56	@Espyo	the Pikmin on the right side has a spicy — yeah

2016-04-30 15:29:54	Marty2000	Probably a glitch

2016-04-30 15:35:33	@Espyo	probably a glitch, yeah
2016-04-30 15:35:37	@Espyo	I mean, it makes the Pikmin invulnerable
2016-04-30 15:35:42	@Espyo	don't really think that's intended

2016-04-30 17:48:06	@Espyo	hi
2016-04-30 17:50:25	En_Passant	Marty plz, those statues are the four suits in playing cards
2016-04-30 17:51:15	Marty2000	I know
2016-04-30 17:51:46	Marty2000	But I put them in "statues" because... well, it's a statue-like...
2016-04-30 17:52:26	Marty2000	But if you have a better idea, please tell me
2016-04-30 17:53:34	Marty2000	Should I make a section for them only? 
2016-04-30 17:54:03	En_Passant	Not that they're statues, but that you called them "pike" and "tile"
2016-04-30 17:55:12	Marty2000	Oh, wait, you're right, I used their French names...

2016-04-30 17:55:53	Marty2000	How do you call them?
2016-04-30 17:56:20	En_Passant	Pike = Spade, Tile = Diamond, Clover = Club
2016-04-30 17:56:42	Marty2000	Thanks

2016-04-30 18:29:20	@Espyo	how?
2016-04-30 18:29:39	En_Passant	You can print it out, do it by hand, and scan it
2016-04-30 18:29:47	@Espyo	no, I mean literally how
2016-04-30 18:29:50	@Espyo	there's no place to put grades on
2016-04-30 18:29:55	En_Passant	Circles
2016-04-30 18:30:05	En_Passant	Or highlighting, if you want to do it digitally
2016-04-30 18:30:23	@Espyo	I see...
2016-04-30 18:30:37	@Espyo	me and Scruffy had the idea that we'd be given a different sheet where we'd actually write down the grades
2016-04-30 18:30:55	En_Passant	Or some other form of marking which indicates which box you've selected
2016-04-30 18:31:00	@Espyo	well, I don't fancy printing SEVEN pages
2016-04-30 18:31:04	@Espyo	so I'll do it digitally
2016-04-30 18:31:32	@Espyo	it would be better if it had this, plus a simple table with all points and you would write down the numbers you want
2016-04-30 18:31:35	@Espyo	it'd all fit in one page
2016-04-30 18:31:39	@Espyo	not very eco-friendly...
2016-04-30 18:31:42	@Espyo	or patience-friendly
2016-04-30 18:32:39	En_Passant	I mean, you might think the category fits multiple numbers at certain places
2016-04-30 18:36:11	En_Passant	For example, maybe a website has the information all neatly organized and logical, but it's written in bright yellow text
2016-04-30 18:36:22	En_Passant	That would fit both 4 and 2
2016-04-30 18:37:55	@Espyo	that doesn't sound right...
2016-04-30 18:41:37	Yoshi2	Espyo: "that doesn't sound right" became your catchphrase in a way
2016-04-30 18:42:36	@Espyo	meanwhile, I need your opinions on this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/pfe_water.gif
2016-04-30 18:42:41	@Espyo	does it make for convincing water for the engine?
2016-04-30 18:43:03	@Espyo	when you work with code, "that doesn't sound right" is as common as the word "the"
2016-04-30 18:45:23	Yoshi2	hmm, that water looks a bit odd
2016-04-30 18:45:35	@Espyo	thought so
2016-04-30 18:45:44	@Espyo	I tried to follow the same logic as this http://www.feudalwars.net/devblog/new-animated-isometric-water-tiles
2016-04-30 18:45:47	@Espyo	but it didn't quite work
2016-04-30 18:45:52	@Espyo	I have NO idea how is it that I'm going to make water
2016-04-30 18:46:09	Yoshi2	with one layer going one direction, the other layer going the opposite direction, more difficult to tell where the water is going
2016-04-30 18:47:49	@Espyo	yeah, that's just it, it's not meant to be going anywhere
2016-04-30 18:47:54	@Espyo	it's just meant to be generic ripples
2016-04-30 18:48:12	Yoshi2	ah, interesting
2016-04-30 18:48:22	Yoshi2	it is supposed to be two layers going in opposite directions
2016-04-30 18:48:28	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-30 18:49:17	Yoshi2	yeah, definitely doesn't look as convincing as on that web site
2016-04-30 18:51:31	Yoshi2	and the technique probably doesn't work well when you want the water to be top down, because it ends up looking as if the water goes somewhere when it shouldn't
2016-04-30 18:51:33	@Espyo	might be because of the graphics used
2016-04-30 18:51:41	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-04-30 18:54:51	@Espyo	En_Passant: honestly, can't we just send a text file saying "Website requirements: 3, Web Site Presentation and Organization: 1", etc.?
2016-04-30 18:56:16	En_Passant	I suppose you could
2016-04-30 18:56:59	@Espyo	well, I'll write it in a text file first
2016-04-30 18:57:02	@Espyo	if I can send that, I will
2016-04-30 18:57:09	@Espyo	if not, I'll transfer the stuff over to the sheet itself
2016-04-30 18:57:19	En_Passant	I can transfer it, if you want
2016-04-30 18:57:41	En_Passant	I'd prefer it to be on one of those rubrics because the instructor's being fussy about it
2016-04-30 18:57:52	@Espyo	yeah, that's the problem
2016-04-30 18:58:18	@Espyo	well, I'll fill in the document itself
2016-04-30 18:58:23	@Espyo	but I won't print it and digitalize it
2016-04-30 18:58:27	@Espyo	if he acts like a little bitch about it
2016-04-30 18:58:33	@Espyo	maybe he should remember that I'm a working man
2016-04-30 18:58:36	@Espyo	don't have time for his little games
2016-04-30 18:59:03	@Espyo	honestly, "hurr durr we need everything to be fancy on these specific documents"
2016-04-30 18:59:05	@Espyo	no, you don't
2016-04-30 18:59:17	@Espyo	you need to know what I think of the presentation, using a grading system from 1 to 4 on different aspects
2016-04-30 18:59:27	@Espyo	I keep my complex notes on a text file, and I manage to work just fine
2016-04-30 18:59:53	@Espyo	sorry for the rant, but when people get bitchy over something they shouldn't, that really ticks me off
2016-04-30 19:02:32	En_Passant	District administration has taken an interest in the class, so I don't blame him tbh
2016-04-30 19:03:06	@Espyo	hm

2016-04-30 19:18:48	Marty2000	I don't think you really need to be on day 3
2016-04-30 19:19:10	Marty2000	As long as it's your first visit, the day isn't important... is it?
2016-04-30 19:19:18	@Espyo	don't know
2016-04-30 19:19:32	@Espyo	anyway, you can't reach the Distant Tundra on day 2
2016-04-30 19:19:40	Marty2000	Yes...
2016-04-30 19:19:41	@Espyo	so saying "or sooner" is dumb
2016-04-30 19:19:54	Marty2000	But I'm sure it's possible on other days...
2016-04-30 19:20:00	Marty2000	Wait, I'll try to verify
2016-04-30 19:20:16	Marty2000	To make sure it's possible on all days
2016-04-30 19:20:58	@Espyo	all right
2016-04-30 19:21:00	@Espyo	good luck
2016-04-30 19:21:28	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-04-30 19:27:54	Marty2000	It's possible on all days
2016-04-30 19:27:57	Marty2000	I'm on day 5
2016-04-30 19:28:57	Marty2000	"If the players also skip the cutscene that plays when meeting the Yellow Pikmin, it will not be possible to use the whistle until the end of the day, unless the player holds a Pikmin and whistles (the whistle's duration will be reduced to less than a second)"  Taken a video about this too
2016-04-30 19:29:07	Marty2000	I've taken*
2016-04-30 19:29:20	Marty2000	Well, I'll undo
2016-04-30 19:29:27	@Espyo	nice
2016-04-30 19:29:33	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-30 19:29:39	@Espyo	and add the fact that it can be done on 2.0
2016-04-30 19:29:46	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-30 19:29:47	@Espyo	on the list of versions the glitch applies to
2016-04-30 19:31:03	Marty2000	Yep, done.

2016-04-30 19:40:31	@Espyo	En_Passant: just to make sure that it's not a problem with LibreOffice
2016-04-30 19:40:42	@Espyo	the Bibliography part of the Web Site chapter
2016-04-30 19:40:50	@Espyo	is missing a description for the grade 4, right?
2016-04-30 19:41:34	En_Passant	yes
2016-04-30 19:41:43	@Espyo	okay, good
2016-04-30 19:46:37	@Espyo	>Pages are not in plastic sleeves/page dividers.
2016-04-30 19:46:37	@Espyo	what
2016-04-30 19:46:39	@Espyo	were they meant to?
2016-04-30 19:48:20	En_Passant	Yes, and I assure you that they are
2016-04-30 19:48:28	En_Passant	At lest he provided them for us
2016-04-30 19:48:30	En_Passant	*least
2016-04-30 19:48:59	@Espyo	hm, okay
2016-04-30 19:49:42	En_Passant	Journal refers to an actual binder, by the way, not the journals on the website
2016-04-30 19:49:49	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-04-30 19:49:50	En_Passant	He said you don't have to worry about that part
2016-04-30 19:49:53	@Espyo	well, in that case, I--
2016-04-30 19:49:54	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-30 19:49:55	@Espyo	okat
2016-04-30 19:49:57	@Espyo	*y
2016-04-30 19:50:11	@Espyo	about the whole Journal section
2016-04-30 19:50:19	@Espyo	or just about the specific parts of that section that refer to the physical document?
2016-04-30 19:50:43	En_Passant	The whole section
2016-04-30 19:50:49	@Espyo	cool
2016-04-30 19:50:59	En_Passant	You may have noticed that it looks a lot like the Website section
2016-04-30 19:51:16	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-30 19:51:19	En_Passant	They're intentionally supposed to contain similar material
2016-04-30 19:51:23	@Espyo	oh
2016-04-30 19:52:32	@Espyo	hm, so are we still going to get a video with the presentation?
2016-04-30 19:52:36	@Espyo	because I can barely remember some parts
2016-04-30 19:52:48	@Espyo	plus I was missing throughout most of the introduction because skype was made by toddlers
2016-04-30 19:53:18	En_Passant	The final one? Yeah, but I don't have it right now
2016-04-30 19:53:42	En_Passant	Monday at the earliest, probably
2016-04-30 19:53:46	@Espyo	okay
2016-04-30 19:57:05	En_Passant	gotta go
2016-04-30 19:57:44	Marty2000	Bye En_Passant

2016-04-30 20:03:14	Marty2000	Hm...did Super-toad 65 moved to Pikmin wikia? :/ He does whatever he wants, after all... but I'd say it's sad to move there, there's less and wrong information
2016-04-30 20:04:07	@Espyo	did he?
2016-04-30 20:04:15	@Espyo	I know some users made account on both wikis
2016-04-30 20:04:20	@Espyo	and then just do whatever
2016-04-30 20:04:45	Marty2000	I haven't seen him connect to Pikipedia for weeks
2016-04-30 20:07:23	Marty2000	Oh wait, if I remember, he told me he was the admin of the italian Pikmin Wikia... so you're right
2016-04-30 20:07:35	@Espyo	ah
2016-04-30 20:07:56	Marty2000	That makes sens he goes to the English one, after all
2016-04-30 20:07:58	Marty2000	sense*
2016-04-30 20:18:52	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/Z9kGadgSfss Here's the whistle glitch
2016-04-30 20:19:07	Marty2000	Still possible to use it as shown at the end, but it's short...
2016-04-30 20:24:49	@Espyo	neat
2016-04-30 20:24:56	@Espyo	you can probably add this info on [[Whistle]] too
2016-04-30 20:24:56	Testyo	"Whistle" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Whistle
2016-04-30 20:25:17	@Espyo	particularly how you're disabled from using the whistle on the first day of the Distant Tundra until you get the Yellow Pikmin cutscene
2016-04-30 20:25:37	@Espyo	I guess it makes sense: they didn't want you to go around whistling the Pikmin on the electrode before you know what Pikmin they are
2016-04-30 20:26:07	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-30 20:26:10	Marty2000	I'll add it
2016-04-30 20:26:23	Marty2000	But of course that makes sense

2016-04-30 20:28:23	Marty2000	Hmm... should I make a Trivia section for it?
2016-04-30 20:28:30	Marty2000	(with the video+ references)
2016-04-30 20:28:51	@Espyo	I was thinking more like saying how the game blocks your whistle
2016-04-30 20:29:12	@Espyo	and then also mention, in the same paragraph, that if the player uses glitches (and link to the glitch article), they can continue the day but be unable to use it
2016-04-30 20:29:21	@Espyo	and also mention how it's possible to use it with the grab
2016-04-30 20:29:56	Marty2000	Oh yes, but I meant I didn't know where to put it (maybe in the introduction?) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Whistle
2016-04-30 20:31:32	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-30 20:31:40	@Espyo	wait, I'm starting to think
2016-04-30 20:31:45	@Espyo	it may be better to have a new section
2016-04-30 20:31:54	@Espyo	about how the player can't always use the whistle because the game locks it
2016-04-30 20:32:00	@Espyo	this happens on the prologue
2016-04-30 20:32:04	@Espyo	probably day 1 with Alph
2016-04-30 20:32:11	@Espyo	and as we see, on the first Distant Tundra day

2016-04-30 20:32:22	@Espyo	yeah, a list of times where the whistle is locked, and what is needed to unlock it
2016-04-30 20:32:33	Marty2000	Also, on the NPC version... you can't whistle Olimar's Pikmin with Louie until you reunite (day 1)
2016-04-30 20:32:34	@Espyo	and in that section you can also link to the glitch and explain how it's still possible to whistle with the grab thingie
2016-04-30 20:32:40	Marty2000	And doesn't work for Early Blues
2016-04-30 20:32:45	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-30 20:32:49	Marty2000	Yes
2016-04-30 20:32:54	@Espyo	I guess that should be noted too
2016-04-30 20:32:59	@Espyo	probably on the starting paragraph
2016-04-30 20:33:08	@Espyo	sorry, starting section
2016-04-30 20:33:13	@Espyo	probably as a new paragraph at the end
2016-04-30 20:33:15	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-30 20:33:42	Marty2000	I'll add these pieces of information

2016-04-30 20:47:43	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-04-30 20:47:52	@Espyo	by "locking the whistle", I was thinking of "nothing happens when the player presses B"
2016-04-30 20:48:00	@Espyo	in NPCP2's case, the player can still whistle
2016-04-30 20:48:03	@Espyo	it's just that it has no effect
2016-04-30 20:48:08	@Espyo	it should probably be re-worded
2016-04-30 20:48:22	Marty2000	Ok
2016-04-30 20:48:25	Marty2000	Wait
2016-04-30 20:48:30	@Espyo	also I think both the NPCP2 things and the P3 things can be put in a new section, come to think of it
2016-04-30 20:48:45	@Espyo	something like "Story mode limitations"
2016-04-30 20:48:55	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-30 20:50:58	Marty2000	Does "locked or modified" sound good?
2016-04-30 20:51:47	@Espyo	eeeehhhh....
2016-04-30 20:52:00	@Espyo	limited probably makes more sense
2016-04-30 20:53:19	Marty2000	Okay
2016-04-30 20:54:10	Marty2000	Done
2016-04-30 20:55:54	Marty2000	So I made a new section called "Story mode limitations"
2016-04-30 20:56:37	@Espyo	looks much better
2016-04-30 20:57:11	@Espyo	oh, Charlie is also locked from using the whistle in the prologue until the Pikmin handling tutorial tells him to, right?
2016-04-30 20:57:20	Marty2000	Oh, yes
2016-04-30 20:57:23	Marty2000	Going to add it

2016-04-30 21:07:55	Testyo	even though there's really doesn't work?
2016-04-30 21:09:27	@Espyo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/pfe_water_2.gif what about this? is this more convincing?
2016-04-30 21:10:01	Marty2000	Oh that's great
2016-04-30 21:10:29	@Espyo	is it? iunno... I don't feel it
2016-04-30 21:10:34	@Espyo	I guess it could work
2016-04-30 21:10:49	@Espyo	Yoshi2: thoughts?
2016-04-30 21:11:16	Marty2000	The water in movement is better
2016-04-30 21:11:31	Marty2000	On the last gif, it was harder to see the water
2016-04-30 21:11:41	Yoshi2	thoughts still being calculated while the gif takes ages to load
2016-04-30 21:11:57	@Espyo	it's a pretty big gif
2016-04-30 21:11:59	@Espyo	my b
2016-04-30 21:12:19	Marty2000	The "a"
2016-04-30 21:12:22	Marty2000	The frist gif*
2016-04-30 21:12:25	Marty2000	first*
2016-04-30 21:13:34	Yoshi2	the movement is better, but the water looks odd (unless the floor looks like that)
2016-04-30 21:14:17	@Espyo	by water, do you mean the surface, or...?
2016-04-30 21:15:04	Yoshi2	I mean the actual texture
2016-04-30 21:15:25	@Espyo	yeah, the texture actually comes from SRB2
2016-04-30 21:15:42	@Espyo	I edited it to make it actually usable as a transparent texture
2016-04-30 21:15:50	@Espyo	I can probably find more convincing textures online
2016-04-30 21:18:00	@Espyo	ok, so what's happening in this latest gif is that you have the floor texture with the gravel, static
2016-04-30 21:18:08	@Espyo	then you have a transparent copy swaying left and right
2016-04-30 21:18:15	@Espyo	and finally you have that animated water texture on top
2016-04-30 21:18:29	@Espyo	would it be enough if I just made the water texture better, I wonder?
2016-04-30 21:18:52	@Espyo	of course, the RIGHT way to do water would be to write a shader to actually distort the floor texture and also distort the water surface highlights
2016-04-30 21:19:00	@Espyo	...but that's so close to wizardry that it might as well be
2016-04-30 21:25:31	@Espyo	never mind, I guess water textures are actually unicorn fur, since they don't exist
2016-04-30 21:25:53	@Espyo	I must be the only human on the face of the planet ever since humanity existed to actually need a texture that has a water surface ripple effect
2016-04-30 21:27:35	Yoshi2	time to do it yourself
2016-04-30 21:27:42	@Espyo	I was just thinking that
2016-04-30 21:27:49	@Espyo	might as well drop all logic and do it myself
2016-04-30 21:27:54	@Espyo	honestly, how can this be SO rare a thing...?
2016-04-30 21:28:00	@Espyo	but I won't DO it because I don't know how
2016-04-30 21:28:07	@Espyo	I'll instead rip it straight from Pikmin 2
2016-04-30 21:28:21	@Espyo	record the game seen from above, showing water on a black texture
2016-04-30 21:28:22	@Espyo	and use that
2016-04-30 21:28:25	@Espyo	it's SO hacky
2016-04-30 21:28:30	@Espyo	but it's still better than any other solution
2016-04-30 21:28:40	@Espyo	good grief, I'm going to look back to the water chapter of the engine after I'm done with it
2016-04-30 21:28:50	@Espyo	and I'm going to either weep or laugh

2016-04-30 21:36:49	@Espyo	there is absolutely no good way to capture Pikmin 2's water
2016-04-30 21:37:04	@Espyo	I could just say SCREW IT and make it so that water sectors are slightly blueish
2016-04-30 21:37:16	@Espyo	and objects that walk on those sectors show some circle ripple textures around them
2016-04-30 21:38:48	Marty2000	I find this one really cool https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/pfe_water_2.gif but if you want water from Pikmin 2, then why not, it can be cool too
2016-04-30 21:39:21	Marty2000	So you need to record the water?
2016-04-30 21:39:39	@Espyo	that was my plan
2016-04-30 21:39:43	@Espyo	but it won't work whatsoever
2016-04-30 21:39:44	Marty2000	Hmm, it's going to be hard
2016-04-30 21:39:47	@Espyo	there's no way to record it
2016-04-30 21:39:55	@Espyo	I mean, there is, but I won't be able to get anything good out of it
2016-04-30 21:40:09	@Espyo	I guess I'll go with something similar to the second gif
2016-04-30 21:40:13	@Espyo	but maybe more polished
2016-04-30 21:40:28	@Espyo	and I'll try to tweak the levels a bit, like how the ground texture is a bit darkened and such
2016-04-30 21:41:08	Marty2000	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/pfe_water_2.gif I'd suggest that you make the... "cirlces" (are they "circles"?) maybe a bit bigger
2016-04-30 21:41:25	@Espyo	yeah
2016-04-30 21:41:28	@Espyo	I think those things have a name
2016-04-30 21:41:30	Yoshi2	the thing that bothers me about the second gif is that, unless the water is somehow dirty, I doubt it will form circles like that
2016-04-30 21:41:37	@Espyo	they're like foam residue you see on the top of ponds
2016-04-30 21:41:43	@Espyo	yeah, exactly what I was thinking...
2016-04-30 21:42:10	@Espyo	hm, actually, SRB2 has a few different water textures
2016-04-30 21:42:16	@Espyo	I chose this one because it seemed the most simple
2016-04-30 21:42:26	@Espyo	but I'll try to turn the other ones into transparent textures

2016-04-30 22:04:24	Marty2000	Hmm... I just discovered something quite "strange" in the French version of NPC! Pikmin 2...
2016-04-30 22:04:48	Marty2000	I have just discovered*
2016-04-30 22:05:27	Marty2000	I'm taking screenshots from Youtube videos and then, I'll explain
2016-04-30 22:05:56	Marty2000	It looks like it doesn't happen in the English versions (European or American)
2016-04-30 22:08:13	Marty2000	So...
2016-04-30 22:08:21	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/17/1462050232-perplexing-pool.jpg
2016-04-30 22:08:29	Marty2000	In the English versions,
2016-04-30 22:08:50	Marty2000	this area is called "Perplexing Pool" in both the GameCube and NPC! versions
2016-04-30 22:08:59	Marty2000	But... in the French versions
2016-04-30 22:09:15	Marty2000	In the Gamecube version :http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/17/1462050232-la-source-troublante.jpg
2016-04-30 22:09:28	Marty2000	It is called "La Source Troublante" (The Perplexing Pool)
2016-04-30 22:09:35	Marty2000	Whereas in the Wii version...

2016-04-30 22:13:36	Marty2000	I wonder if it is the same with other areas

2016-04-30 22:31:23	@Espyo	yeah, En_Passant told me
2016-04-30 22:31:29	@Espyo	I need the video as a refresher, though
2016-04-30 22:35:00	@Espyo	Marty2000: yeah... weird
2016-04-30 22:35:32	Marty2000	Maybe to gain some place? 
2016-04-30 22:35:46	@Espyo	maybe
2016-04-30 22:35:50	Marty2000	Or consistency with the English version...
2016-04-30 22:35:58	Marty2000	I can't find any real explanation

2016-05-01 12:49:02	Testyo	if you guys remember when i am notorious for horrible backgrounds :P
2016-05-01 12:49:21	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-01 12:51:03	@J	I do remember
2016-05-01 12:51:31	@Espyo	remember what
2016-05-01 12:53:59	Yoshi2	testyo being notorious for horrible backgrounds
2016-05-01 12:53:59	Testyo	wait have to ask
2016-05-01 12:54:05	Yoshi2	or espyo, by extension
2016-05-01 12:56:07	@Espyo	I always ignore what Testyo has to say for a hello
2016-05-01 12:56:07	Testyo	Actually, in P3 shadows are accurate, if something's under the ground you won't see the lights probably don't take enough power to make it matter
2016-05-01 12:56:22	@Espyo	J: I thought you were replying to me highlighting you yesterday
2016-05-01 12:56:44	@Espyo	long story short, I wondered if there was some website or program or whatever that read some text you gave it, and returned a shorter version
2016-05-01 12:56:59	@Espyo	there are a lot of common expressions and ways to organize words that can be replaced with shorter ones
2016-05-01 12:57:06	Yoshi2	if you are just going to ignore what testyo says, then i will stop greeting testyo :<
2016-05-01 12:57:06	@Espyo	and that's probably really useful for a lot of people
2016-05-01 12:57:07	Testyo	WTF OLIMAR NEO!
2016-05-01 12:57:23	@Espyo	it's not really an ignore... it's more like a friendly dismiss
2016-05-01 12:57:29	@Espyo	yeah, let's go with that
2016-05-01 12:57:48	@Espyo	oh, and I was wondering if YOU knew of some website like that, J
2016-05-01 13:00:23	Yoshi2	you could make bank with a technology like that
2016-05-01 13:01:20	@Espyo	make bank?
2016-05-01 13:01:37	Marty2000	Hi
2016-05-01 13:01:44	Yoshi2	get lots of money
2016-05-01 13:01:59	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-01 13:02:01	@Espyo	never really hard that
2016-05-01 13:02:05	@Espyo	but yeah
2016-05-01 13:02:07	@Espyo	hi Marty2000
2016-05-01 13:03:08	Yoshi2	"make bank" is definitely a thing, although probably not formal

2016-05-01 13:44:42	@Espyo	hmmm
2016-05-01 13:44:51	@Espyo	they don't look like edits, but they sure are similar
2016-05-01 13:49:47	Marty2000	Blues are probably an edit of this http://pasteboard.co/B5OuVJK.jpg though (from the manual of Pikmin 2, about maturity)

2016-05-01 14:45:26	@Espyo	I think we shouldn't add any of the Japanese treasures
2016-05-01 14:45:32	@Espyo	a lot of them differ
2016-05-01 14:45:39	@Espyo	and it wouldn't really mean much for the readers of the wiki
2016-05-01 14:46:38	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-01 14:46:57	Marty2000	I didn't add the others because I wasn't sure
2016-05-01 14:47:04	@Espyo	right
2016-05-01 14:47:04	Marty2000	So I'll delete it 
2016-05-01 14:47:07	@Espyo	okay
2016-05-01 14:47:14	@Espyo	btw, aren't there fire geysers on the Distant Tundra?
2016-05-01 14:47:40	Marty2000	Yes there are
2016-05-01 14:47:49	Marty2000	We also have to add the Mission Mode locations
2016-05-01 14:47:50	@Espyo	I'll add it to the fire geyser article then

2016-05-01 14:50:12	@Espyo	hmm, I think we only concluded that they fall quicker if they're flower Pikmin
2016-05-01 14:50:25	@Espyo	I checked a leaf White Pikmin, and it fell quicker on the GameCube
2016-05-01 14:50:36	@Espyo	it could've been a miscalculation on my part, but it certainly wasn't slower
2016-05-01 14:54:04	Marty2000	Leaf White fell quicker in the Gamecube version?
2016-05-01 14:54:08	Marty2000	The *
2016-05-01 14:54:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-01 14:54:47	Marty2000	Maybe flower Pikmin fall more slowly in the Gamecube version... and more quickly in the Wii one
2016-05-01 14:54:52	Marty2000	I don't remember about the others
2016-05-01 14:55:10	Marty2000	But if you remember more information, then you're probably right.
2016-05-01 14:55:44	Yoshi2	seems like NPC has a lot of differences, because you've been talking about the differences for quite a while now
2016-05-01 14:56:12	@Espyo	Abr 29 21:10:56 <Espyo>	leaf White Pikmin, P1: 11 frames

2016-05-01 14:56:55	@Espyo	might as well mention that only flowers fall quickly
2016-05-01 14:57:01	@Espyo	the rest can be discarded as "it's pretty much the same"

2016-05-01 15:14:22	Klemen702	anyone interested in hearing a lame joke?
2016-05-01 15:14:46	Yoshi2	Klemen702: memememememe me
2016-05-01 15:15:16	Klemen702	why did the chicken cross the road?
2016-05-01 15:15:22	Klemen702	it didn't want any demonic beings on it
2016-05-01 15:15:46	Klemen702	hehe get it
2016-05-01 15:15:48	Klemen702	''cross''
2016-05-01 15:16:37	Yoshi2	would be better with something else instead of the chicken
2016-05-01 15:16:47	Yoshi2	something more fitting
2016-05-01 15:17:00	Klemen702	maaaybe
2016-05-01 15:17:02	Yoshi2	bishop or pastor or anything
2016-05-01 15:17:15	Klemen702	if it's a chicken people woudn't guess the joke
2016-05-01 15:17:30	Yoshi2	of course that requires you wanting to make the joke not lame
2016-05-01 15:17:30	Klemen702	the suprise is the fun part
2016-05-01 15:19:44	Yoshi2	the fun part is when you realize the joke is more lame than expected
2016-05-01 15:27:12	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bomb_rock&curid=275&diff=163346&oldid=163065 which one is the size of a Pikmin?
2016-05-01 15:27:15	@Espyo	the GC one or the Wii one?
2016-05-01 15:27:27	Marty2000	wii
2016-05-01 15:27:42	@Espyo	it should be specified on the article
2016-05-01 15:27:48	@Espyo	otherwise the readers will have the same question
2016-05-01 15:29:22	Marty2000	Isn't it already mentioned?
2016-05-01 15:30:48	@Espyo	you say "(about the size of a Pikmin)"
2016-05-01 15:30:54	@Espyo	so something is the size of a Pikmin
2016-05-01 15:30:58	@Espyo	but it's not clear which of the two versions
2016-05-01 15:31:32	@Espyo	you could be saying "the bomb rocks on the Wii version are bigger than the GameCube version (the latter are the size of a Pikmin)"
2016-05-01 15:31:36	@Espyo	and your edit would still make sense
2016-05-01 15:31:44	@Espyo	you could also be seeing the former are the size of a Pikmin
2016-05-01 15:31:47	@Espyo	and the edit still makes sense
2016-05-01 15:31:50	@Espyo	so it's pretty ambiguous
2016-05-01 15:32:55	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-01 15:39:29	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Bomb rock by Marty (+10 m) http://www.pikminwiki.com/?curid=275&diff=163416
2016-05-01 15:40:29	Marty2000	I've taken your sentence ("the bomb rocks on the Wii version are bigger than the GameCube version (the latter are the size of a Pikmin). But honestly, I thought it could be understood with my" It should be noted that bomb-rocks are also bigger in ''New Play Control! Pikmin'' than in ''Pikmin''. But well, if it's ambiguous, then sure it needs modifying
2016-05-01 15:45:14	@Espyo	yeah, but you could be saying that the bomb rocks used to be the size of a Pikmin on the GameCube
2016-05-01 15:45:17	@Espyo	and on the Wii, they're bigger
2016-05-01 15:45:48	@Espyo	the way you had it would make most people assume that the bomb rocks on the Wii are the size of a Pikmin
2016-05-01 15:45:51	@Espyo	...but maybe not all
2016-05-01 15:46:06	@Espyo	if we want a wiki where everybody can understand the info, we should try to have it written in a way where you can't mistake it
2016-05-01 15:46:15	@Espyo	if somebody's distracted, or too young, or something
2016-05-01 15:46:18	@Espyo	they'll be a bit confused
2016-05-01 15:46:32	@Espyo	not like it matters much, but hey, might as well make it the most understandable possible, right?
2016-05-01 15:47:01	Marty2000	Yes, sure
2016-05-01 15:50:28	@Espyo	ok, I'm thinking we should move forward with the plan for the new upload screen
2016-05-01 15:50:41	@Espyo	I need volunteers
2016-05-01 15:51:56	@Espyo	particularly, I need people who can run Javascript userscripts on their browser
2016-05-01 15:52:04	@Espyo	so, Firefox users with Greasemonkey installed
2016-05-01 15:52:07	@Espyo	dunno about Chrome users...
2016-05-01 15:52:10	@Espyo	might work straight away
2016-05-01 15:52:41	Marty2000	I use Chrome

2016-05-01 15:58:44	@Espyo	I thought you could run userscripts straight away, but nope
2016-05-01 15:58:47	@Espyo	you need Tampermonkey
2016-05-01 15:58:56	@Espyo	it's a Chrome addon
2016-05-01 15:58:59	@Espyo	can you go install it?
2016-05-01 15:59:06	Marty2000	I'll check, I just have to finish my Splatoon match
2016-05-01 15:59:07	@Espyo	I'll then give you the script that will replace Pikipedia's upload page
2016-05-01 15:59:10	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-01 15:59:17	@Espyo	what about you, Yoshi2?

2016-05-01 16:09:14	@Espyo	maybe I wrote something in a way Chrome is not a fan of

2016-05-01 16:17:39	@Espyo	yep, that's it
2016-05-01 16:17:44	@Espyo	now, experiment with the fields a bit
2016-05-01 16:17:49	@Espyo	to see if everything goes right and makes sense
2016-05-01 16:17:54	Marty1401	Okay
2016-05-01 16:19:46	Marty1401	There are lots of options

2016-05-01 16:21:41	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-01 16:21:49	@Espyo	basically, what this script will do
2016-05-01 16:22:03	@Espyo	is populate the final description box automatically with what the user picks
2016-05-01 16:22:09	@Espyo	it'll call a template for this
2016-05-01 16:22:17	@Espyo	that will look something like [[Pikipedia:Sandbox]]

2016-05-01 16:22:37	@Espyo	so, it'll automatically place a box on the image page that says if it's a screenshot, what its game is, etc.

2016-05-01 16:23:52	@Espyo	it's no different from any other interwiki link

2016-05-01 16:25:55	@Espyo	either somebody was stupid enough to give them bot permissions
2016-05-01 16:26:06	@Espyo	or wikia glitched, and won't show me this user's changes unless I enable "view bots"

2016-05-01 16:32:15	Marty1401	The only thing that may be missing is an option to choose several games (for example, Bulbmin appear in P2 and NPC!P2, but I can only choose from one of them)
2016-05-01 16:32:45	Marty1401	But I can still add it in the box, right?
2016-05-01 16:36:40	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-01 16:36:49	@Espyo	yeah, but the screenshot only comes from one game
2016-05-01 16:37:07	@Espyo	in fact, it shouldn't even matter if it's P2 or NPCP2
2016-05-01 16:37:10	@Espyo	but it could matter in the future
2016-05-01 16:37:12	@Espyo	so might as well keep it

2016-05-01 16:45:53	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-05-01 16:46:02	@Espyo	it puts the summary on a field called "description" instead of "summary"
2016-05-01 16:46:03	@Espyo	I'll fix it
2016-05-01 16:46:21	Marty1401	Yes
2016-05-01 16:46:53	@Espyo	but it seems to be working
2016-05-01 16:46:58	@Espyo	what are your thoughts?
2016-05-01 16:47:01	@Espyo	could it be simpler?
2016-05-01 16:47:03	@Espyo	more complex?
2016-05-01 16:47:42	Marty1401	It's cool and easier to use

2016-05-01 17:01:53	Marty1401	I'll explain

2016-05-01 17:03:42	@Espyo	I'm so confused
2016-05-01 17:03:43	Marty1401	The Onion will be as the same spot as it is on day 1

2016-05-01 19:31:32	UltraMario	heh
2016-05-01 19:31:35	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-01 19:31:55	UltraMario	one of his side special customs is basically the hammer flip without the charge
2016-05-01 19:32:10	UltraMario	he didnt have that in melee or brawl
2016-05-01 19:32:21	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-01 19:32:28	UltraMario	but
2016-05-01 19:32:28	Marty2000	I have it on the 3DS

2016-05-01 19:32:37	UltraMario	same
2016-05-01 19:32:41	Marty2000	But I need to make the character with that custom move
2016-05-01 19:32:51	UltraMario	i transferred all of my sets from 3ds
2016-05-01 19:32:58	Marty2000	And I don't have my SSB3DS right now

2016-05-01 19:33:09	UltraMario	just dont use the charge
2016-05-01 19:33:14	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-01 19:33:26	UltraMario	or the move in the air, actually
2016-05-01 19:33:31	UltraMario	forgot to mention that
2016-05-01 19:33:41	Marty2000	I'll have to remember to make it for the tournament

2016-05-01 19:40:11	UltraMario	thnx
2016-05-01 19:40:20	Marty2000	Well, some lag, though...
2016-05-01 19:40:26	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-01 19:40:35	Marty2000	Probably because I'm uploading a video ath the same time

2016-05-01 19:42:03	@Espyo	ScruffyChat: yeah, it can probably be more general
2016-05-01 19:42:10	@Espyo	but I'm thinking more about putting it under [[bomb rock]]

2016-05-01 19:42:24	@Espyo	which also mentioned the blueness
2016-05-01 19:42:28	@Espyo	I figured I'd just keep it
2016-05-01 19:42:28	ScruffyChat	Ah
2016-05-01 19:42:39	@Espyo	so you're going on a trip, Scruffy?

2016-05-01 19:50:54	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-01 19:51:02	Marty2000	I heard of that

2016-05-01 19:51:28	UltraMario	also
2016-05-01 19:51:40	UltraMario	his dash attack has always changed since brawl
2016-05-01 19:51:45	UltraMario	but smash 4 broke that tradition
2016-05-01 19:51:46	UltraMario	:P
2016-05-01 19:51:47	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-01 19:51:54	UltraMario	same as brawl's
2016-05-01 19:52:02	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-01 19:52:05	@Espyo	oddly specific place
2016-05-01 19:52:06	UltraMario	yup
2016-05-01 19:52:18	@Espyo	well, have fun out there
2016-05-01 19:52:21	@Espyo	what did you want to ask me?
2016-05-01 19:53:05	ScruffyChat	Thank you
2016-05-01 19:53:46	ScruffyChat	I read on Wikipedia's manuals that it's best to avoid phrases like Interestingly, It should be note that, to note is that, etc.
2016-05-01 19:54:02	ScruffyChat	Because they imbalance the attention that information should be given
2016-05-01 19:54:30	@Espyo	well, that is true
2016-05-01 19:54:34	@Espyo	plus they are subjective
2016-05-01 19:54:46	@Espyo	but I don't know... I guess a game wiki is a bit different
2016-05-01 19:54:48	ScruffyChat	Or they bias one piece of info as more important or rarer than the rest
2016-05-01 19:54:52	ScruffyChat	Yeah, that's true
2016-05-01 19:55:11	@Espyo	we have the regular game information, and then we have this bit of information that makes no sense in the game world or real world
2016-05-01 19:55:19	@Espyo	it's definitely something that should probably deserve a bit more attention
2016-05-01 19:55:30	@Espyo	although we as wiki really should try not to have stuff like that
2016-05-01 19:55:34	@Espyo	I mean, stuff like "interestingly"
2016-05-01 19:55:42	UltraMario	lol
2016-05-01 19:55:48	@Espyo	I guess it's just part of the implied or unenforced policies 
2016-05-01 19:56:09	ScruffyChat	Yeah
2016-05-01 19:56:10	@Espyo	maybe one day in the far far future we can decide a proper policy on what the stance should be towards that
2016-05-01 19:56:21	ScruffyChat	heh, no problem
2016-05-01 19:56:53	UltraMario	rip
2016-05-01 19:57:12	Marty2000	If you don't mind, well play Smash when I finish uploading my video

2016-05-01 19:58:12	@Espyo	so does that mean you know Korean?
2016-05-01 19:58:17	Neocraftz1553	Ultramario....
2016-05-01 19:58:49	Neocraftz1553	I deleted Miitomo... I didn't have enough space for it...
2016-05-01 19:59:14	ScruffyChat	I have been learning rudimentary phrase
2016-05-01 19:59:16	ScruffyChat	s
2016-05-01 19:59:31	ScruffyChat	Which brings me to four languages that I know at least a taste of
2016-05-01 19:59:34	Marty2000	Oh, south Korea
2016-05-01 19:59:41	@Espyo	hehehe, nice
2016-05-01 19:59:42	@Espyo	sounds fun
2016-05-01 19:59:47	Marty2000	I love their cuisine
2016-05-01 19:59:53	Marty2000	Especially the way they use vegetables
2016-05-01 19:59:56	UltraMario	let me know when you're ready

2016-05-01 20:00:10	@Espyo	Tuesday after the next one
2016-05-01 20:00:14	@Espyo	and then I'll return one week after
2016-05-01 20:00:24	Yoshi2	but in that time
2016-05-01 20:00:27	@Espyo	I'll bring my laptop, but if it's anything like last year, I won't be on IRC much
2016-05-01 20:00:32	Yoshi2	who will be looking after the channel? D:
2016-05-01 20:00:54	@Espyo	J is still here, zombified

2016-05-01 20:08:17	Neocraftz1553	Marty2000: Good job on your decoration project so far
2016-05-01 20:08:31	Neocraftz1553	kool
2016-05-01 20:08:35	@Espyo	it's hard to decide how much time to spend on it before making it public
2016-05-01 20:08:36	Marty2000	Thanks Neocraftz1553
2016-05-01 20:08:45	@Espyo	too little, and you release something filled with glitches and weirdnesses
2016-05-01 20:08:53	@Espyo	too much, and you spend forever tweaking and never get it done
2016-05-01 20:08:57	@Espyo	I've wrote that code like a month ago
2016-05-01 20:09:06	@Espyo	and kept delaying because it needs to be reviewed, it needs to be tested, bla bla
2016-05-01 20:09:17	Neocraftz1553	hmm...
2016-05-01 20:09:25	@Espyo	there has to be a balance, and I think that the time it spent in production and the time it'll take to fix problems after I make it public now is a good balance
2016-05-01 20:09:30	ScruffyChat	New upload page! That's exciting
2016-05-01 20:09:45	@Espyo	yep, I think it ended up pretty good
2016-05-01 20:09:53	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-01 20:10:46	Neocraftz1553	I think a 3-5 minute timer would do well

2016-05-01 20:20:08	Marty2000	Last time I said that, you reacted, though
2016-05-01 20:22:14	@Espyo	ok, it should be public now

2016-05-01 20:22:23	@Espyo	everybody try that
2016-05-01 20:22:29	@Espyo	maybe do Ctrl+F5
2016-05-01 20:22:33	@Espyo	or Ctrl+Shift+F5
2016-05-01 20:22:36	@Espyo	or something
2016-05-01 20:22:48	@Espyo	until the instructions at the top change to something much shorter
2016-05-01 20:22:57	@Espyo	and the actual upload fields change to something different from usual
2016-05-01 20:23:22	Marty2000	It works
2016-05-01 20:23:34	@Espyo	Marty2000: it might work for you because you have the script still
2016-05-01 20:23:36	@Espyo	or did you disable it?
2016-05-01 20:24:03	Marty2000	If you open a private window, Tampermonkey does not launch
2016-05-01 20:24:09	@Espyo	oh, that's neat
2016-05-01 20:24:14	@Espyo	I don't think that's right, but it's neat
2016-05-01 20:24:14	Marty2000	I tried a few hours ago
2016-05-01 20:24:20	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-01 20:24:28	Marty2000	And the new page wasn't here
2016-05-01 20:24:31	Marty2000	Now it is

2016-05-01 20:26:18	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-01 20:26:28	@Espyo	this should be much nicer for the uploader
2016-05-01 20:26:35	@Espyo	not having to worry about adding game categories, area categories, etc.
2016-05-01 20:26:40	@Espyo	just follow the instructions, and you're all set
2016-05-01 20:26:46	@Espyo	plus, some people ignored the policy box
2016-05-01 20:26:51	@Espyo	I guess it's because it's too daunting
2016-05-01 20:26:59	@Espyo	so now, they just pick the type, and most of the time, everything is chosen for them
2016-05-01 20:27:15	@Espyo	ok, I'll launch some news about it
2016-05-01 20:27:39	ScruffyChat	Cool!
2016-05-01 20:27:54	Marty2000	It's really easier to use. It's a good change
2016-05-01 20:28:15	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-01 20:28:17	@Espyo	I want to believe it is
2016-05-01 20:28:25	@Espyo	it's complicated
2016-05-01 20:28:34	@Espyo	it does remove some of the responsibility... but it also removes some of the power
2016-05-01 20:28:49	@Espyo	well, kinda; you can click on the show final result box thingie and you can edit it freely
2016-05-01 20:28:51	@Espyo	but still

2016-05-01 20:30:16	ScruffyChat	I'd say any given editor would rather have the uploader be convenient than powerful
2016-05-01 20:30:33	@Espyo	I guess
2016-05-01 20:30:36	ScruffyChat	and this is certainly more convenient
2016-05-01 20:30:47	@Espyo	another thing I'm worried about is that before, you could just type a description, choose the license, and be done with it
2016-05-01 20:30:52	@Espyo	now, you have to go through all these steps...
2016-05-01 20:30:58	@Espyo	and you complete some steps, and some more appear
2016-05-01 20:31:07	@Espyo	I'm sure that some people will be disappointed by that
2016-05-01 20:31:10	@Espyo	let's hope not
2016-05-01 20:31:17	@Espyo	I can only guess two kinds of people, anyway
2016-05-01 20:31:19	@Espyo	the long time users
2016-05-01 20:31:24	@Espyo	who understand the change, and actually find it better
2016-05-01 20:31:25	@Espyo	like you guys
2016-05-01 20:31:32	@Espyo	so the "lots of fields" problem isn't a problem
2016-05-01 20:31:39	@Espyo	and the occasional uploaders
2016-05-01 20:31:44	@Espyo	but those only upload once or twice
2016-05-01 20:32:07	@Espyo	so if they complain about some extra fields but only upload two images, they should consider stop being so pissy
2016-05-01 20:36:11	ScruffyChat	This allows for some combinations I wish we could get, like textures from the Pikmin Short Movies
2016-05-01 20:37:15	ScruffyChat	Gotta go

2016-05-01 20:38:52	Marty2000	To have more steps is better to me : with this system, there are fewer chances of missing a category when uploading something. In the past, you had to write every category. And if you missed one, you had to edit it...
2016-05-01 20:39:13	Marty2000	to edit the upload*
2016-05-01 20:40:04	@Espyo	yeah, but not everybody will think the same

2016-05-02 19:43:40	Marty2000	I don't really want to criticize them but I will be honest, their information in the "May's announcements" section is old
2016-05-02 19:44:08	@Espyo	criticizing kirby is fair game
2016-05-02 19:44:11	@Espyo	he's a disgusting backstabber
2016-05-02 19:44:23	Marty2000	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Affiliates So they really have an affiliation...
2016-05-02 19:44:26	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-02 19:44:38	Marty2000	I didn't know
2016-05-02 19:45:10	@Espyo	don't really care about their affiliation
2016-05-02 19:47:00	Marty2000	The problem about non-English wikis... is that they have very little information
2016-05-02 19:47:17	Marty2000	And nobody is probably going to add some
2016-05-02 19:47:37	Marty2000	(most of the time)
2016-05-02 19:48:01	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-02 19:56:13	Marty2000	Also, we really don't know anything about Pikmin 4... so perhaps it's too early to make a poll about it. I hope it will be a true game like other Pikmin, but if it's released on mobile... They're going to do so for Animal Corssing

2016-05-02 20:07:40	Marty2000	"Interestingly, if you keep resetting, it might be possible for the hole to the next sublevel to appear under a low ceiling. If so, you can use it to climb out of bounds. You will just reappear elsewhere after a bit."
2016-05-02 20:07:47	Marty2000	I know that :
2016-05-02 20:07:57	Marty2000	It never happened to me in the NPC! versions
2016-05-02 20:08:17	Marty2000	Happened to me twice or thrice while playing the GameCube version
2016-05-02 20:08:33	Marty2000	The hole and the geyser can spawn pretty close to each other

2016-05-02 20:09:12	Marty2000	That's true, and your Pikmin will follow you in the pit
2016-05-02 20:09:23	Marty2000	Even after the leader respawned
2016-05-02 20:09:25	@Espyo	"low ceiling" doesn't make sense though...

2016-05-02 22:20:59	Marty2000	I don't if I should write it "Hyperborean Verdant Silo (America) / Frosty Plant (Europe)" or organize differently

2016-05-02 23:44:21	@Espyo	space-wise, not time-wise
2016-05-02 23:44:25	@Espyo	but I can just increase the texture
2016-05-02 23:44:36	@Espyo	it still feels a bit too artificial...
2016-05-02 23:44:41	@Espyo	but it's my best take yet
2016-05-02 23:47:45	Marty2000	I think the pattern is good like how it is now. Neither too small nor too big
2016-05-02 23:47:54	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-02 23:47:58	@Espyo	everybody seems to agree this looks good
2016-05-02 23:48:07	@Espyo	I'll put it on the engine and actually get a feel for it
2016-05-02 23:48:11	@Espyo	it might end up great
2016-05-02 23:48:20	@Espyo	it's just... seeing it like this, I'm not really feeling it
2016-05-02 23:48:25	@Espyo	but it could just be creator bias
2016-05-02 23:49:37	En_Passant	The ripples don't seem super accurate to me, but then again, I don't know much about complex water movement
2016-05-02 23:50:58	@Espyo	yeah, my main gripe is with the ripples
2016-05-02 23:51:05	@Espyo	they look too patterny
2016-05-02 23:51:09	@Espyo	they're more random in the real world

2016-05-03 22:24:01	@Espyo	is it really unused...?
2016-05-03 22:24:49	Marty2000	I don't know...
2016-05-03 22:25:06	Marty2000	But he seems to be a "data miner"
2016-05-03 22:25:34	@Espyo	I saw the values in P3 too
2016-05-03 22:25:39	@Espyo	but I wouldn't really call those ones unused
2016-05-03 22:25:43	@Espyo	I mean, technically they are

2016-05-03 22:25:54	@Espyo	the game doesn't have a full Blonde Impostor in Mission Mode
2016-05-03 22:25:55	Marty2000	So I was also wondering...
2016-05-03 22:26:00	Marty2000	But it seems true
2016-05-03 22:26:02	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-03 22:26:08	@Espyo	but it's probably written automatically based on the fact that one part is 100, and two is naturally 200
2016-05-03 22:26:13	Marty2000	About the Blonde Impostor
2016-05-03 22:26:23	@Espyo	if the whole fruit value was DIFFERENT from the sum of the parts
2016-05-03 22:26:26	@Espyo	that would be interesting
2016-05-03 22:26:30	@Espyo	but like this... iunno...
2016-05-03 22:26:35	@Espyo	but I'm working on the engine now
2016-05-03 22:26:35	Marty2000	Yes

2016-05-04 19:13:00	Marty2000	Hi, by the way
2016-05-04 19:13:06	UltraMario	theory
2016-05-04 19:13:07	UltraMario	what if
2016-05-04 19:13:12	UltraMario	it's a handheld game
2016-05-04 19:13:14	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-04 19:13:24	UltraMario	i mean
2016-05-04 19:13:37	Marty2000	What I wouldn't like to have is a Pikmin on mobile
2016-05-04 19:13:37	UltraMario	it being on wii u seems unlikely at this point
2016-05-04 19:13:38	UltraMario	:V
2016-05-04 19:13:54	UltraMario	i was thinking 3ds
2016-05-04 19:13:58	Marty2000	Ye
2016-05-04 19:13:59	Marty2000	Yes*
2016-05-04 19:14:00	UltraMario	or new
2016-05-04 19:14:16	Marty2000	It would still be better than for mobile, according to me
2016-05-04 19:14:47	Marty2000	However, i still fear they make it on mobile, as they are already making an Animal Crossing game for mobiles, as well as a Fire Emblem game
2016-05-04 19:15:02	UltraMario	i dont see how it being mobile is a problem
2016-05-04 19:15:03	UltraMario	i mean
2016-05-04 19:15:19	UltraMario	nintendo seems to be doing an alright job at that so far
2016-05-04 19:15:32	Marty2000	It's just a problem for me, not for everybody. That was just a subjective point of view ;)
2016-05-04 19:15:37	UltraMario	i mean
2016-05-04 19:15:49	UltraMario	i can see why someone would be worried
2016-05-04 19:15:49	UltraMario	:P
2016-05-04 19:15:50	UltraMario	but
2016-05-04 19:15:55	UltraMario	this is nintendo
2016-05-04 19:16:11	UltraMario	i expect quality from them
2016-05-04 19:16:32	UltraMario	i dont expect them to stoop to the trends that other mobile devs have

2016-05-04 20:29:08	@Espyo	so we had to stay a bit after work to plan this out
2016-05-04 20:29:11	@Espyo	and today we actually had that
2016-05-04 20:29:13	@Espyo	it was fun
2016-05-04 20:29:23	@Espyo	good to see everybody actually agrees that our code looks like spaghetti
2016-05-04 20:29:28	@Espyo	and tastes like wood

2016-05-04 22:26:51	@Espyo	what happens if you have Olimar and Louie?
2016-05-04 22:27:10	@Espyo	does the game keep the same leader, switch to Olimar, switch to Louie, or switch to the leader you are not controlling?
2016-05-04 22:27:20	@Espyo	I'm asking about NPCP2
2016-05-04 22:27:35	@Espyo	the info that's there before your edit is what I gathered from the GameCube P2
2016-05-04 22:27:43	Marty2000	I don't know
2016-05-04 22:27:50	Marty2000	I will check soon
2016-05-04 22:27:55	@Espyo	okay
2016-05-04 22:28:03	Marty2000	I just have to finish something and I'll check.
2016-05-04 22:28:08	@Espyo	ok, thanks

2016-05-04 22:31:56	Marty2000	UltraMario : if you don't mind, later. The next days are days off in France, so I'll be able to play more. Plus I am currently doing things in Pikmin. It's not that I don't want to play, but I'd like to finish things to not forget them. Sorry :/
2016-05-04 22:32:03	UltraMario	oh okay
2016-05-04 22:32:05	UltraMario	hats fine
2016-05-04 22:32:08	UltraMario	*that
2016-05-04 22:32:12	UltraMario	:>
2016-05-04 22:32:29	Marty2000	Espyo, I am going to check. Hi En_Passant
2016-05-04 22:32:36	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-04 22:33:09	En_Passant	o/
2016-05-04 22:34:59	Marty2000	So the situations I have to check : Entering with Olimar and checking if it switches to the other leader, entering with Louie instead... and entering a sublevel instead of the cave. That' s it?
2016-05-04 22:35:54	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-04 22:35:58	@Espyo	don't think there's any other possible scenario
2016-05-04 22:40:00	Marty2000	Entering a cave as Olimar doesn't make the game switch to Louie. Entering another sublevel as Olimar doesn't make the game switch to Louie. Entering a cave as Louie makes the game switch to Olimar. Entering another sublevel as Louie doesn't make the game switch to Olimar.
2016-05-04 22:40:27	Marty2000	I'll check for when you exit a cave
2016-05-04 22:40:57	@Espyo	hm, I'm not sure if I checked cave exiting
2016-05-04 22:41:04	@Espyo	but please try a geyser exit and a pause menu exit
2016-05-04 22:41:13	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 22:41:15	@Espyo	I'd bet the two of them were programmed differently
2016-05-04 22:44:04	Marty2000	"Entering a cave as Louie makes the game switch to Olimar." Doesn't happen when entering the Emergence Cave... I'll retry after exiting the cave (all scenarios) and different caves...
2016-05-04 22:44:52	@Espyo	wait, you mean that the game never switches leaders on the Emergence Cave?
2016-05-04 22:45:01	Marty2000	Seems like it
2016-05-04 22:45:10	@Espyo	this is getting dumber and dumber...
2016-05-04 22:45:15	@Espyo	maybe it depends on each cave?
2016-05-04 22:45:17	@Espyo	each game version?
2016-05-04 22:45:20	@Espyo	each game region?
2016-05-04 22:45:24	@Espyo	if the cave is completed or not?
2016-05-04 22:45:31	@Espyo	a combination of all of them?
2016-05-04 22:45:33	Marty2000	Exiting the Emergence Cave as Louie (geyser) makes the game switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 22:45:40	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-04 22:45:46	@Espyo	ok, this definitely needs more research
2016-05-04 22:45:50	@Espyo	this game is so janky...
2016-05-04 22:46:22	Marty2000	Entering the Emergence Cave as Olimar makes the game switch to Louie
2016-05-04 22:47:24	@Espyo	 /what/
2016-05-04 22:47:33	Marty2000	Throwing a WHite Pikmin from a plant makes it fall more slowly and slightly further (lol)
2016-05-04 22:48:19	Marty2000	Doesn't change anything if you exit the cave (geyser) with Olimar
2016-05-04 22:48:25	Marty2000	Going to test with the pause menu
2016-05-04 22:48:43	@Espyo	...Whites too?
2016-05-04 22:48:52	@Espyo	this game is so random with its rules
2016-05-04 22:49:05	Marty2000	So
2016-05-04 22:49:16	Marty2000	I've just entered the Emergence Cave with Olimar
2016-05-04 22:49:22	Marty2000	And it didn't switch to Louie this time
2016-05-04 22:49:29	@Espyo	........
2016-05-04 22:49:39	@Espyo	it might just be random...
2016-05-04 22:50:06	En_Passant	Maybe it's based on whoever landed first or something dumb
2016-05-04 22:50:12	@Espyo	ugh, yeah
2016-05-04 22:50:20	@Espyo	can you try entering the Emergence Cave like 5 times, always with Olimar??
2016-05-04 22:50:22	@Espyo	*-?
2016-05-04 22:50:25	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 22:50:27	@Espyo	I'll try on my end on the GameCube too
2016-05-04 22:50:34	@Espyo	this should make it clear if it's random
2016-05-04 22:50:37	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu with Olimar doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 22:50:41	Marty2000	But
2016-05-04 22:50:53	Marty2000	You can guess what leader you will control when you see them fall
2016-05-04 22:51:06	Marty2000	The first leader you can see if the one you will control
2016-05-04 22:51:41	@Espyo	is this true for the entrance, sublevel change, exit, or all of them?
2016-05-04 22:51:47	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 22:51:51	Marty2000	All of them
2016-05-04 22:52:13	Marty2000	And I've just entered the E.C again, it didn't switch...
2016-05-04 22:52:14	@Espyo	well, that'll be useful to know when we can find some damn pattern for who the game chooses
2016-05-04 22:53:13	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu with Louie makes the game switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 22:53:20	Marty2000	Going to retry...
2016-05-04 22:53:59	Marty2000	This time it switched to Louie when entering as Olimar
2016-05-04 22:54:12	En_Passant	probably random spawning when making them fall from the sky
2016-05-04 22:54:17	Marty2000	(entering the cave)
2016-05-04 22:54:53	@Espyo	seems random, definitely...
2016-05-04 22:55:03	Marty2000	Again, " Exiting through the pause menu with Louie makes the game switch to Olimar"
2016-05-04 22:55:08	Marty2000	But yes
2016-05-04 22:55:10	Marty2000	Seems random
2016-05-04 22:56:14	Marty2000	It didn't switch to Louie when entering as Olimar...
2016-05-04 22:56:45	Marty2000	Again, " Exiting through the pause menu with Louie makes the game switch to Olimar"
2016-05-04 22:57:36	Marty2000	I've just entered he cave with Louie, and it switched to Olimar
2016-05-04 22:57:54	Marty2000	Trying a last time the pause menu with Louie
2016-05-04 22:58:14	Marty2000	It switched to OLimar agin
2016-05-04 22:58:17	Marty2000	again*
2016-05-04 22:58:27	@Espyo	I entered the cave like 6 times
2016-05-04 22:58:34	@Espyo	went down the next sublevel
2016-05-04 22:58:35	Marty2000	This one seems to be constant : " Exiting through the pause menu with Louie makes the game switch to Olimar"
2016-05-04 22:58:40	@Espyo	and half of the time, I quit from the pause menu, the other half from the geyser
2016-05-04 22:58:46	@Espyo	and I always did entrances with Olimar
2016-05-04 22:58:50	@Espyo	and the game NEVER switched me out of Olimar
2016-05-04 22:58:57	Marty2000	Really?
2016-05-04 22:59:03	@Espyo	to note though is that I have Olimar and the President
2016-05-04 22:59:09	@Espyo	yeah, on the GameCube
2016-05-04 22:59:20	Marty2000	Hmm... how bizarre
2016-05-04 22:59:30	@Espyo	definitely
2016-05-04 22:59:37	@Espyo	could be because the cave is complete, or because of the President
2016-05-04 22:59:50	Marty2000	I have my savefile of 2009 with the President
2016-05-04 22:59:52	Marty2000	Going to try
2016-05-04 22:59:57	@Espyo	actually, I'll try a complete save file here too
2016-05-04 23:00:01	@Espyo	on the US version of NPCP2
2016-05-04 23:00:09	Marty2000	OK
2016-05-04 23:00:11	@Espyo	wonder if it's related to the region
2016-05-04 23:00:15	@Espyo	guess we'll both try
2016-05-04 23:00:27	Marty2000	I have the European version, if it helps
2016-05-04 23:00:38	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2016-05-04 23:00:42	@Espyo	that's why I said we should both try :V
2016-05-04 23:00:50	@Espyo	that way if we get different results, we can blame it on the region
2016-05-04 23:01:14	@Espyo	ok, I'll do the same as I did before
2016-05-04 23:01:20	@Espyo	all actions are done with Olimar
2016-05-04 23:01:29	@Espyo	emulator froze :|
2016-05-04 23:01:31	Marty2000	I'll do so
2016-05-04 23:01:57	Marty2000	I'll try with the Mergence Cave
2016-05-04 23:01:59	Marty2000	Emergence*
2016-05-04 23:02:08	@Espyo	yeah, all of my tests were on the Emergence Cave
2016-05-04 23:02:47	@Espyo	ok, I can't do this
2016-05-04 23:02:50	@Espyo	the game freezes when I enter caves
2016-05-04 23:03:01	Marty2000	First try
2016-05-04 23:03:13	Marty2000	Entering as Olimar doesn't make the game switch to the President
2016-05-04 23:03:46	Marty2000	Entering another sublevel doesn't make the game switch
2016-05-04 23:04:49	Marty2000	Exiting (geyser) doesn't make the game switch to the President
2016-05-04 23:05:12	Marty2000	===Second try===
2016-05-04 23:05:28	Marty2000	 Entering as Olimar doesn't make the game switch to the President

2016-05-04 23:06:19	@Espyo	the wiki has "does have it's moments"

2016-05-04 23:07:35	Marty2000	The person who wrote "it's" made a little mistake
2016-05-04 23:07:48	@Espyo	thought so

2016-05-04 23:07:56	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-04 23:08:09	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:08:15	Marty2000	I'm still Olimar
2016-05-04 23:08:24	Marty2000	Going to try a last time with Olimar...
2016-05-04 23:08:55	Marty2000	===Third Try===
2016-05-04 23:09:01	@Espyo	the chances of it being random, but you getting Olimar 3 times in a row on entry, is 12.5%
2016-05-04 23:09:04	Marty2000	 Entering as Olimar doesn't make the game switch to the President
2016-05-04 23:09:09	@Espyo	I'm sorry to ask, but could you try a fourth time too?
2016-05-04 23:09:13	@Espyo	just to be extra sure?
2016-05-04 23:09:16	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 23:09:22	@Espyo	if it's random, there's a 1 in 10 chance that you just got unlucky :|
2016-05-04 23:09:40	Marty2000	Entering another sublevel doesn't make the game switch
2016-05-04 23:10:03	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:10:15	Marty2000	===Fourth try===
2016-05-04 23:10:33	@Espyo	I guess you can try quitting from the geyser this time, for fairness' sake
2016-05-04 23:10:36	Marty2000	Entering as Olimar doesn't make the game switch to the President
2016-05-04 23:10:49	@Espyo	hmm... very interesting
2016-05-04 23:10:58	Marty2000	Entering another sublevel doesn't make the game switch
2016-05-04 23:11:44	Marty2000	Exiting through a geyser doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:11:54	Marty2000	We can conclude that
2016-05-04 23:11:55	@Espyo	guess that's that
2016-05-04 23:12:09	Marty2000	If Olimar's partner is the President, nothing changes when performing actions as Olimar
2016-05-04 23:12:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-04 23:12:21	@Espyo	and the game version doesn't matter
2016-05-04 23:12:21	Marty2000	I'll try with the President
2016-05-04 23:12:27	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:12:32	@Espyo	but this is true at least for the completed Emergence Cave
2016-05-04 23:12:32	Marty2000	Four tries with the President
2016-05-04 23:12:43	@Espyo	could still depend on the cave and whether it's completed or not
2016-05-04 23:12:47	@Espyo	I'll try with the President too
2016-05-04 23:12:50	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:12:52	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 23:12:52	@Espyo	on the GameCube
2016-05-04 23:13:07	Marty2000	===First try===
2016-05-04 23:13:28	Marty2000	Entering as the President makes the game switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:13:32	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:13:55	Marty2000	Entering another sublevel with the President doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:14:01	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:14:43	Marty2000	Exiting thanks to a geyser as the President makes the game switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:14:47	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:14:49	@Espyo	so far so good
2016-05-04 23:15:01	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:15:07	Marty2000	===Second try===
2016-05-04 23:15:24	Marty2000	Entering as the President doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:15:27	@Espyo	the game... kept the President when I entered the cave
2016-05-04 23:15:28	@Espyo	yeah!
2016-05-04 23:15:32	@Espyo	why...?!
2016-05-04 23:15:38	Marty2000	Seems there's something constant
2016-05-04 23:15:50	@Espyo	maybe... the first time of the day will switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:15:56	@Espyo	but the second+ times will leave your leader alone?
2016-05-04 23:16:03	@Espyo	I've been doing all of these on the same day, I'm guessing you have too
2016-05-04 23:16:08	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:16:13	Marty2000	Entering another sublevel with the President doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:16:15	@Espyo	this is so weird!

2016-05-04 23:16:38	Marty2000	I wonder what's the cause of this whole mess, ha ha
2016-05-04 23:16:45	@Espyo	weird code
2016-05-04 23:16:58	@Espyo	the kind of code that when you look at it, it makes you think "there's no way this works"
2016-05-04 23:17:01	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu as the President makes the game switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:17:20	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:17:40	Marty2000	===Third try===
2016-05-04 23:17:48	Marty2000	Entering as the President doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:17:50	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:18:09	Marty2000	Entering another sublevel with the President doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:18:16	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:18:49	Marty2000	Exiting thanks to a geyser as the President makes the game switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:18:52	Marty2000	Weird
2016-05-04 23:18:54	@Espyo	same
2016-05-04 23:18:59	Marty2000	I'll try again
2016-05-04 23:19:01	@Espyo	fourth and final, let's go
2016-05-04 23:19:14	@Espyo	entrance: no switch
2016-05-04 23:19:22	Marty2000	===Fourth try===
2016-05-04 23:19:31	Marty2000	Same
2016-05-04 23:19:32	@Espyo	sublevel: no switch
2016-05-04 23:19:48	@Espyo	pause quit: switch to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:19:51	Marty2000	Same
2016-05-04 23:20:06	@Espyo	ok... looks like it's fair to assume that...
2016-05-04 23:20:14	Marty2000	Same
2016-05-04 23:20:22	@Espyo	leaving the cave will always switch to Olimar, if you have the President
2016-05-04 23:20:30	@Espyo	entering a sublevel never has an impact
2016-05-04 23:20:30	Marty2000	Trying a fifth time to make extra sure
2016-05-04 23:20:34	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-04 23:20:35	@Espyo	I will too
2016-05-04 23:20:55	@Espyo	entering a cave will switch to Olimar if it's the first cave of the day, it will keep the leader if not
2016-05-04 23:21:04	Marty2000	===Fifth try===
2016-05-04 23:21:08	Marty2000	Doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:21:12	@Espyo	looks like that's what we can conclude
2016-05-04 23:21:14	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:22:11	Marty2000	However, if you noticed with Louie, it switched to Olimar the first time I entred a cave, not the second nor third time, but it switched again to Olimar the fourth try
2016-05-04 23:22:12	@Espyo	got no change on entry as well, but this time I quit on the first sublevel to see what would happen, and the game still switched to Olimar when they landed on the Valley of Repose
2016-05-04 23:22:16	Marty2000	If I remember well
2016-05-04 23:22:29	Marty2000	Got no change either
2016-05-04 23:22:30	@Espyo	hm, yeah, I think it was that
2016-05-04 23:22:42	Marty2000	I'll try in a different area
2016-05-04 23:22:42	@Espyo	but we can safely assume that the fact that it's Wii or GC doesn't have an impact
2016-05-04 23:22:50	@Espyo	so we had a total of 10 combined experiments with the President
2016-05-04 23:22:50	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:22:54	@Espyo	and only the first ones had a switch
2016-05-04 23:23:07	@Espyo	I think it's safe to say that for the President, what we know is cleared
2016-05-04 23:23:12	@Espyo	at least, again, for a completed Emergence Cave
2016-05-04 23:23:15	@Espyo	maybe Louie is random?
2016-05-04 23:23:16	Marty2000	Yes, all our experimentations were the same, and so were our results
2016-05-04 23:23:44	Marty2000	I don't know for Louie
2016-05-04 23:23:55	@Espyo	guess we'll figure out Louie later
2016-05-04 23:23:58	Marty2000	I'm going to try with the President with the Citadel of Spiders
2016-05-04 23:24:03	@Espyo	I'll try a different area and cave too, with the President
2016-05-04 23:24:08	Marty2000	And I'll try for Louie afterwards
2016-05-04 23:24:10	@Espyo	I'll try Wistful Wild
2016-05-04 23:24:13	@Espyo	(President)
2016-05-04 23:24:14	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 23:24:18	@Espyo	your caves are all completed, yeah?
2016-05-04 23:24:23	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:24:49	Marty2000	All actions are performed with the President
2016-05-04 23:24:55	Marty2000	===First try===
2016-05-04 23:25:00	Marty2000	It didn't switch
2016-05-04 23:25:15	Marty2000	Goodbye theroy
2016-05-04 23:25:18	Marty2000	theory*
2016-05-04 23:25:20	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-04 23:25:24	@Espyo	damn you Pikmin 2...
2016-05-04 23:25:33	@Espyo	I wonder if we just got insanely lucky and it's actually random...
2016-05-04 23:25:42	@Espyo	I'll try the Emergence Cave again
2016-05-04 23:25:47	@Espyo	as the first one of the day
2016-05-04 23:25:56	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 23:26:20	Marty2000	Maybe it changes depending on : the leaders, the cave, whether they are completed or not, the way we enter the cave, or pure randomness
2016-05-04 23:26:22	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-04 23:26:29	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-04 23:27:14	@Espyo	switched to Olimar still
2016-05-04 23:27:19	@Espyo	also I kept bringing a single White with me
2016-05-04 23:27:23	@Espyo	brought a Yellow this time; no impact
2016-05-04 23:27:26	Marty2000	Same for me
2016-05-04 23:27:59	@Espyo	you brought a Yellow too?
2016-05-04 23:28:00	@Espyo	hah
2016-05-04 23:28:04	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu makes the game switch
2016-05-04 23:28:08	Marty2000	A white
2016-05-04 23:28:11	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-04 23:28:16	Marty2000	I can try with a Yellow on my second try
2016-05-04 23:28:18	@Espyo	switch from the President to Olimar, right?
2016-05-04 23:28:23	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:28:31	@Espyo	I really doubt the Pikmin have an impact... but this game is so crazy, that they could
2016-05-04 23:28:44	Marty2000	===Second try===
2016-05-04 23:28:57	Marty2000	Didn't switch
2016-05-04 23:29:07	Marty2000	...
2016-05-04 23:29:28	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu makes the game switch
2016-05-04 23:29:41	Marty2000	I'll try the E.C again after my third try
2016-05-04 23:30:02	@Espyo	hm, Cavern of Chaos 1 switched from the President to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:30:12	Marty2000	===Third try===
2016-05-04 23:30:17	Marty2000	Didn't switch when entered
2016-05-04 23:30:34	Marty2000	Really? Ok... 
2016-05-04 23:30:52	Marty2000	Exiting through the pause menu makes the game switch
2016-05-04 23:31:03	Marty2000	Going to try the E.C and then the Cavern of Chaos
2016-05-04 23:31:08	@Espyo	ok
2016-05-04 23:31:11	@Espyo	I'll try Citadel of Spiders
2016-05-04 23:31:19	Marty2000	Ok, thanks
2016-05-04 23:31:32	Marty2000	Normally, your game shouldn't switch if you enter as the President
2016-05-04 23:31:51	@Espyo	aaaaaand...
2016-05-04 23:31:56	@Espyo	it switched
2016-05-04 23:31:57	@Espyo	DAMMIT
2016-05-04 23:32:02	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-04 23:32:12	Marty2000	I'll retry when finished with the E.C
2016-05-04 23:32:14	@Espyo	is it possible that you didn't switch to the President?
2016-05-04 23:32:24	@Espyo	and entered as Olimar?
2016-05-04 23:32:41	Testyo	holy was last Saturday
2016-05-04 23:32:45	Marty2000	I entered as the President every time
2016-05-04 23:32:50	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-04 23:33:11	Marty2000	===First try===
2016-05-04 23:33:14	Marty2000	.......
2016-05-04 23:33:17	Marty2000	It didn't switch
2016-05-04 23:33:20	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-04 23:33:27	Marty2000	Please
2016-05-04 23:33:30	@Espyo	what on? CoC?
2016-05-04 23:33:35	Marty2000	Emergence Cave
2016-05-04 23:33:39	Marty2000	First try of the day
2016-05-04 23:33:45	Marty2000	Entered as the President
2016-05-04 23:33:50	@Espyo	oh wow
2016-05-04 23:34:08	Marty2000	I don't think we got lucky
2016-05-04 23:34:18	Marty2000	There must be some logic behind all that mess
2016-05-04 23:34:32	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-04 23:34:35	@Espyo	I'll try a frame-by-frame
2016-05-04 23:34:45	@Espyo	if it's random... then entering on different frames should affect the outcmoe
2016-05-04 23:34:46	@Espyo	*outcome
2016-05-04 23:34:56	Marty2000	===Seconbd try===
2016-05-04 23:34:58	Marty2000	Nothing changed
2016-05-04 23:35:00	Marty2000	Didn't switch
2016-05-04 23:35:06	Marty2000	Going to try Cavern of Choas
2016-05-04 23:35:08	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 23:35:40	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-04 23:35:44	Marty2000	It should be noted that
2016-05-04 23:35:53	Marty2000	I brought a Yellow Pikmin instead of a White one this time
2016-05-04 23:36:05	@Espyo	hmmm...
2016-05-04 23:36:17	Marty2000	But I really doubt it does change the result
2016-05-04 23:36:23	@Espyo	but I tried a Yellow on the EC before, and I got a change
2016-05-04 23:36:32	Marty2000	So yeah
2016-05-04 23:36:42	Marty2000	The Pikmin doesn't change anything
2016-05-04 23:36:45	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-04 23:36:51	@Espyo	doesn't seem to be dependent on the frame either
2016-05-04 23:36:58	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-04 23:37:03	@Espyo	what a wild ride we got ourselves into
2016-05-04 23:37:19	@Espyo	I honestly can't think of any variable that could control this
2016-05-04 23:37:20	Marty2000	Entering the CoC with the President
2016-05-04 23:37:26	@Espyo	I think we tried everything
2016-05-04 23:37:26	Marty2000	===First try===
2016-05-04 23:37:29	@Espyo	it's not a specific cave or area
2016-05-04 23:37:33	Marty2000	And
2016-05-04 23:37:36	@Espyo	it's not a specific entrance number during the day
2016-05-04 23:37:37	Marty2000	It didn't switch
2016-05-04 23:37:41	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:37:42	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-04 23:37:42	@Espyo	not Pikmin-type dependent...
2016-05-04 23:37:52	@Espyo	I think I'm ready to say "unknown factors"
2016-05-04 23:38:17	Marty2000	It switched when you entered the CoC?
2016-05-04 23:38:24	@Espyo	uhm...
2016-05-04 23:38:24	Marty2000	Did it switch?
2016-05-04 23:38:26	@Espyo	can't remember
2016-05-04 23:38:55	@Espyo	CoC switched to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:38:59	Marty2000	I think it did change for you
2016-05-04 23:39:11	@Espyo	yeah, I scrolled up to check
2016-05-04 23:39:13	Marty2000	===Second try===
2016-05-04 23:39:17	Marty2000	Nothing changed
2016-05-04 23:39:21	@Espyo	if only I could disassemble the game and know what I'm doing, I could maybe find out what controls it
2016-05-04 23:39:29	@Espyo	knowing this game, it could be something as stupid as the camera angle
2016-05-04 23:39:35	@Espyo	...no way
2016-05-04 23:39:44	@Espyo	I will actually fly to Japan and punch somebody in the face if it's the camera angle
2016-05-04 23:39:47	@Espyo	let me test
2016-05-04 23:40:12	@Espyo	ok, it's not
2016-05-04 23:40:14	@Espyo	good
2016-05-04 23:40:29	Marty2000	By the way, throwing a White from a plant makes it go slightly further and land more slowly
2016-05-04 23:40:36	Marty2000	It does not go higher, though
2016-05-04 23:40:44	@Espyo	yeah, you said before
2016-05-04 23:40:52	@Espyo	you need to remember to point that down
2016-05-04 23:40:52	Marty2000	It's weird...
2016-05-04 23:40:56	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:41:04	@Espyo	but as for the cave thing...
2016-05-04 23:41:04	Marty2000	Going to write it for later
2016-05-04 23:41:14	@Espyo	what do you say, should we call it inconclusive?
2016-05-04 23:41:27	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:41:28	Marty2000	But
2016-05-04 23:41:31	Marty2000	Just note that
2016-05-04 23:41:36	Marty2000	When exiting the cave as the President
2016-05-04 23:41:40	Marty2000	It always switches to Olimar
2016-05-04 23:41:44	@Espyo	yes
2016-05-04 23:41:44	Marty2000	no matter the circumstances
2016-05-04 23:41:51	@Espyo	and going to a different level never ever switches leaders
2016-05-04 23:41:59	@Espyo	it's just the cave entrance itself that's mysterious
2016-05-04 23:42:14	@Espyo	I'll go edit the article then
2016-05-04 23:42:23	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-04 23:42:52	@Espyo	we've been at this for an hour!...
2016-05-04 23:43:20	Marty2000	Lots of experiments for weird conclusions. But at least we've learned something
2016-05-04 23:44:18	Marty2000	It's good to see there are lots of things to discover in a 12 year-old-game
2016-05-04 23:44:46	Marty2000	...
2016-05-04 23:44:59	Marty2000	Throwing a Purple Pikmin from a plant makes it go less far
2016-05-04 23:45:08	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-04 23:45:14	@Espyo	yeah, this game is so special to me because of this
2016-05-04 23:45:17	@Espyo	it's so weirdly made
2016-05-04 23:45:25	@Espyo	that every little nook and cranny is filled with mystery
2016-05-04 23:45:29	@Espyo	for absolutely no reason whatsoever
2016-05-04 23:45:34	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-04 23:46:17	Marty2000	The thing about whites and plants seem to happen for Blues

2016-05-04 23:47:03	Marty2000	I just make videos for proofs
2016-05-04 23:48:35	@Espyo	so different Pikmin have different effects when tossed from plants?
2016-05-04 23:48:37	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-04 23:48:46	@Espyo	hm, what about chiyogami?
2016-05-04 23:48:59	Marty2000	I'm going to try
2016-05-04 23:49:06	Marty2000	I've tried with the brownish plant
2016-05-04 23:49:10	@Espyo	you already tried all Pikmin types with the fire geyser, right?
2016-05-04 23:49:10	Marty2000	Can't recall the name

2016-05-04 23:53:52	@Espyo	Nvortex: yeah
2016-05-04 23:53:58	Nvortex	are you testing the "throw pikmin further"?
2016-05-04 23:54:05	Marty2000	Espyo and I have been making weird experiments
2016-05-04 23:54:10	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-04 23:54:41	Marty2000	Or in the case of Purples
2016-05-04 23:54:42	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Cave&curid=332&diff=163572&oldid=162933
2016-05-04 23:54:45	Marty2000	Thow Pikmin less far
2016-05-04 23:55:03	Nvortex	espyo, do you think that maybe some days before e we should add the "preparations for pikmin 4" in the forums? (and delete it if no game is announced)
2016-05-04 23:55:49	@Espyo	before E3, you mean?
2016-05-04 23:55:55	@Espyo	we can keep it anyway
2016-05-04 23:56:01	Nvortex	"When entering the first sublevel of a cave, the game may or may not switch the player's current leader. At the moment, it is not known what controls this change, or if it is random. However, it is known that the game will never switch leaders when going from one sublevel to the next, and leaving the cave will always switch to Captain Olimar.
2016-05-04 23:56:02	@Espyo	just because E3 doesn't say anything doesn't mean we won't get a new game
2016-05-04 23:56:03	Nvortex	wait what
2016-05-04 23:56:10	Nvortex	isnt it always the one you are using?
2016-05-04 23:56:15	@Espyo	heck, even if we don't get Pikmin 4, we can get a spinoff game or something, and the same guidelines appear
2016-05-04 23:56:21	@Espyo	nope, the game switches it up
2016-05-04 23:56:23	@Espyo	sometimes
2016-05-04 23:56:26	Nvortex	ah yes  meant e3, i had that bloq num thing turned off
2016-05-04 23:56:27	@Espyo	we can't figure out why
2016-05-04 23:56:32	Marty2000	So

2016-05-04 23:56:34	Nvortex	jeez
2016-05-04 23:56:35	Marty2000	Chiyogami
2016-05-04 23:56:42	Marty2000	Doesn't change anything for Reds, Whites and Blues
2016-05-04 23:56:49	Marty2000	Changes for Purples and Yellows
2016-05-04 23:56:58	Marty2000	Purples are thrown less far
2016-05-04 23:57:05	@Espyo	hm, I actually think you reached this conclusion before :/
2016-05-04 23:57:14	@Espyo	I think you might've just tested again for nothing

2016-05-04 23:57:42	@Espyo	oh, but there's no info there about Purples
2016-05-04 23:57:54	@Espyo	are Whites thrown farther with corpses?
2016-05-04 23:58:10	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/V--Bd3nuBQ4
2016-05-04 23:58:11	Marty2000	No
2016-05-04 23:58:17	Marty2000	But little corpses
2016-05-04 23:58:23	Marty2000	Purples are thrown very far
2016-05-04 23:58:29	Marty2000	(not high, tough)
2016-05-04 23:58:45	Marty2000	https://youtu.be/iCZnrreDRtE Yellows and corpses
2016-05-04 23:59:59	@Espyo	damn
2016-05-05 00:00:14	Marty2000	So
2016-05-05 00:00:20	@Espyo	I figured that since the game treats the chiyogami like an enemy, it would be the same as a corpse
2016-05-05 00:00:32	@Espyo	...but maybe throwing Pikmin from a live enemy will have an impact similar to the Chiyogami
2016-05-05 00:00:33	Marty2000	When throwing a Yellow Pikmin against a Breadbug
2016-05-05 00:00:37	Marty2000	It goes higher
2016-05-05 00:00:46	@Espyo	a live one?
2016-05-05 00:00:53	Marty2000	When doing the same with Purples
2016-05-05 00:01:00	Marty2000	They go very far (but not higher)
2016-05-05 00:01:01	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 00:01:03	Marty2000	They live
2016-05-05 00:01:15	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-05 00:01:19	@Espyo	ok, so, to recap
2016-05-05 00:01:35	@Espyo	on a plant, Yellows are thrown higher, Whites are thrown farther, Purples aren't affected
2016-05-05 00:01:49	@Espyo	on chioygami, Yellows go higher, Purples are thrown less far
2016-05-05 00:01:53	@Espyo	on a corpse... I can't even remember
2016-05-05 00:01:58	@Espyo	and on a live enemy, it's what you said just now
2016-05-05 00:02:04	@Espyo	this game is SO SO JANKY
2016-05-05 00:02:08	@Espyo	and I'm really tired
2016-05-05 00:02:19	@Espyo	I'm having a hard time keeping track of all of these shenanigans

2016-05-05 00:03:11	@Espyo	something that reflects how different Pikmin on different objects behave differently, on different games

2016-05-05 00:20:05	Marty2000	Nearly twice the normal distance
2016-05-05 00:20:17	Marty2000	Yellows are thrown higher

2016-05-05 16:30:56	@PikFan	hi Marty
2016-05-05 16:31:05	@PikFan	sorry I haven't been on in a while
2016-05-05 16:31:11	@PikFan	been having a family crisis
2016-05-05 16:31:38	Marty2000	Oh, sorry :/ Don't be sorry, that's okay
2016-05-05 16:31:50	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-05 16:32:07	@PikFan	so, I was reading some logs to see what I missed
2016-05-05 16:32:17	@PikFan	Scruffy's already left, it seems
2016-05-05 16:32:26	@PikFan	and Espyo's going on a trip to the UK pretty soon?
2016-05-05 16:33:19	Marty2000	Next week, if I remember
2016-05-05 16:33:25	Marty2000	And Scruffy left
2016-05-05 16:33:27	@PikFan	hm, I see
2016-05-05 16:33:44	@PikFan	I like Espyo's new uploading script
2016-05-05 16:33:52	Marty2000	I assume he's left because I haven't seen him the last days
2016-05-05 16:34:15	@PikFan	Scruffy said he was leaving on May 3
2016-05-05 16:34:15	Marty2000	Yes, that's really cool, it's way easier to upload files
2016-05-05 16:34:23	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2016-05-05 16:34:33	@PikFan	I'm wondering if I can create a version of it for Fanon
2016-05-05 16:34:45	Marty2000	That'd be cool
2016-05-05 16:34:47	@PikFan	but I still need to create licenses...
2016-05-05 16:34:58	@PikFan	I'm gonna need Espyo's help for that
2016-05-05 16:41:21	Marty2000	I am making changes for Pikmin Adventure articles. It's just horrible... The names, descriptions, dialogues, and so are all different (most of the time) between America and Europe
2016-05-05 16:41:24	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-05 16:41:39	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-05 16:41:49	@PikFan	no help from me here
2016-05-05 16:42:02	@PikFan	I don't have Nintendo Land, so I never got to play Pikmin Adventure
2016-05-05 16:42:28	Marty2000	I have the European version, and I use Youtube videos to complete the American part
2016-05-05 16:42:40	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-05 16:42:43	Marty2000	Pikmin Adventure is a fun game, but it's quite different from the normal games
2016-05-05 16:43:01	Marty2000	It's not really the same thing...

2016-05-05 19:41:20	Marty2000	There are Youtube videos with them, of course...
2016-05-05 19:41:47	Marty2000	But the majority of these videos either skip them, or replay the levels (and so, the dialogs do not appear again)

2016-05-05 19:49:31	@Espyo	btw, Marty
2016-05-05 19:49:38	@Espyo	does Nintendo Land actually call the things on the plaza "statues"?
2016-05-05 19:49:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 19:49:52	@Espyo	oh, okay
2016-05-05 19:49:53	Marty2000	Sometimes "prizes", sometimes "statues"
2016-05-05 19:50:04	Marty2000	I can look for more precise examples, if you wish
2016-05-05 19:50:14	Marty2000	But I'm sure I have already seen both
2016-05-05 19:51:19	Marty2000	"Prizes" seems more common, though
2016-05-05 19:51:21	@Espyo	no need, no need
2016-05-05 19:51:42	@Espyo	although if you think "prize" is more common, maybe we should rename the article from statues to prizes
2016-05-05 19:51:54	@Espyo	although I guess the "prize" is the present you get from the mini-game
2016-05-05 19:52:01	@Espyo	and the "statue" is the actual object you can examine
2016-05-05 19:52:21	@Espyo	but in that case, the Jukebox might be a raw prize, and not really a statue
2016-05-05 19:52:22	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-05 19:52:26	Marty2000	Monita calls them "prizes"

2016-05-05 19:54:31	Marty2000	Well, I think we should rename them to "prizes"
2016-05-05 19:54:59	Marty2000	Because Monita calls the last prize "Completionist's Prize
2016-05-05 19:55:23	@Espyo	hm, right
2016-05-05 19:55:27	@Espyo	all right, go right ahead

2016-05-05 19:55:32	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 19:55:50	Marty2000	It always call them "prizes", so...
2016-05-05 19:56:03	Marty2000	However, I still remember seeing "statue" once...

2016-05-05 20:11:22	Marty2000	It seems we are the only wiki to add information about these prizes.  That makes me want to add the rest on other wikis... I thought the prizes would have been already added, but no.
2016-05-05 20:11:58	@Espyo	yeah, I guess not a lot of people care about Nintendo Land
2016-05-05 20:12:53	Marty2000	The attractions are non-canonical, so I think this is the explanation.
2016-05-05 20:13:22	Marty2000	Plus the attractions are usually different from the original games (Pikmin Adventure is a good example)

2016-05-05 21:03:38	@Espyo	the only text I can remember being blue is the one I'm typing right now
2016-05-05 21:03:45	@Espyo	other than that, the text on the engine shouldn't turn blue

2016-05-05 21:28:54	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:All_leaders%27_silouhette.png I've just found out that in Pikmin ADventure, "Olimar" doesn't have a silouhette, but Pikmin players do.
2016-05-05 21:28:58	Marty2000	Hi Nvortex
2016-05-05 21:29:47	@Espyo	hm...
2016-05-05 21:29:49	Nvortex	i didn't knw there was a silhouette for the president
2016-05-05 21:29:53	@Espyo	guess it makes sense, the camera is focused on Olimar
2016-05-05 21:30:01	@Espyo	so he's theoretically always in view
2016-05-05 21:31:48	Marty2000	I can add them, but right now I only have two Wii Remotes at my disposal... so I can only take screenshots of the Blue's and Red's Pikmin silouhettes. 
2016-05-05 21:32:26	@Espyo	eh, no need
2016-05-05 21:32:29	@Espyo	just say that they exist
2016-05-05 21:32:41	@Espyo	honestly, not many people will care about the Pikmin Adventure info
2016-05-05 21:32:47	@Espyo	both in terms of adding it and in terms of reading it
2016-05-05 21:32:59	@Espyo	you CAN if you want to, but there are more important things you can spend your time on
2016-05-05 21:34:06	Marty2000	Then, what more important things should I spend my time on? And of course, Pikmin ADventure is not really important, but I still think it's good to have info on it

2016-05-05 21:36:37	@Espyo	yeah, I think it's good too
2016-05-05 21:36:55	@Espyo	but something like getting an image of the silhouettes is so specific and not particularly useful
2016-05-05 21:37:07	@Espyo	mentioning it could be slightly interesting
2016-05-05 21:37:21	@Espyo	but an image won't really add much over the text, and will just be a waste of time, probably
2016-05-05 21:37:58	Marty2000	Ok.
2016-05-05 21:45:17	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/The_Impact_Site#Objects I know what to add for the obstacles, but about the plants, I guess I should only add the "identified vegetation", right? 
2016-05-05 21:45:58	Marty2000	I think it's rather useless to the unidentified vegetation, we don't even know the true names of certain plants, but I just want to make sure

2016-05-05 22:30:07	@Espyo	it has emoji though :V
2016-05-05 22:30:16	@Espyo	oh, and text to speach

2016-05-05 22:31:32	Nvortex	i was actually trying o use italics not underlining
2016-05-05 22:31:39	@Espyo	yeah, I know
2016-05-05 22:31:43	Nvortex	yeah i know its mibbit but i wasnt sure thats why i said IRC
2016-05-05 22:31:43	@Espyo	<Espyo> italics doesn't work because it's hacky
2016-05-05 22:31:55	@Espyo	like
2016-05-05 22:32:00	@Espyo	I can see people use italics in other places
2016-05-05 22:32:03	@Espyo	but I can't use it myself
2016-05-05 22:32:10	@Espyo	even though I'm running HexChat, which is much more powerful
2016-05-05 22:32:16	@Espyo	and lets me do the bolds and underlines at will
2016-05-05 22:32:18	@Espyo	actually, let me try
2016-05-05 22:32:27	@Espyo	testing, testing
2016-05-05 22:32:32	@Espyo	wait, did that work?
2016-05-05 22:32:36	@Espyo	it worked on my end
2016-05-05 22:32:41	Nvortex	nothing happened
2016-05-05 22:32:48	@Espyo	:|
2016-05-05 22:32:51	@Espyo	Mibbit's fault
2016-05-05 22:33:09	Nvortex	has pikfan been here lately?

2016-05-05 23:03:24	Marty2000	Hmm, Espyo
2016-05-05 23:03:31	Marty2000	I got something interesting
2016-05-05 23:03:41	Marty2000	Before entering the Citadel of Spider, right now
2016-05-05 23:03:41	@Espyo	oh?
2016-05-05 23:03:44	Marty2000	As Olimar
2016-05-05 23:03:51	Marty2000	I whistled the President before entering
2016-05-05 23:03:56	Marty2000	And it switched to the President
2016-05-05 23:04:44	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-05 23:04:48	@Espyo	I did think about that too
2016-05-05 23:04:49	Marty2000	So maybe the whistle is the cause of this mess... or not
2016-05-05 23:05:06	@Espyo	if it mattered whether you switch leader, and then whistle the other one
2016-05-05 23:05:11	@Espyo	or have both, and switch leaders while already in the group
2016-05-05 23:05:18	@Espyo	but it didn't have an impact on my tests
2016-05-05 23:05:26	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-05 23:05:56	Marty2000	I'm still trying to find an explanation but I just can't :/ I'm sure there is something that controls this
2016-05-05 23:06:52	@Espyo	yeah, same...
2016-05-05 23:06:54	@Espyo	it can't be random
2016-05-05 23:07:14	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-05-05 23:07:16	Marty2000	Another thing
2016-05-05 23:07:22	Marty2000	Try to play a long time with the President
2016-05-05 23:07:29	Marty2000	Doing stuff like throwing and whistling a Pikmin
2016-05-05 23:07:36	Marty2000	And then, enter a cave as Olimar
2016-05-05 23:07:42	Marty2000	It switches to the President for me.
2016-05-05 23:07:43	@Espyo	hm, I don't think that'll have an impact
2016-05-05 23:08:01	@Espyo	considering we started a day on the Valley of Repose, went straight for the EC with the President, and it switched for the both of us
2016-05-05 23:08:05	@Espyo	and then you tried the exact same later
2016-05-05 23:08:09	@Espyo	and didn't get a switch
2016-05-05 23:08:15	@Espyo	or was it the other way around?
2016-05-05 23:08:24	@Espyo	either way, you got different results doing exactly the same, which is to go to the cave asap
2016-05-05 23:08:30	Marty2000	I switched to the President before enteing
2016-05-05 23:08:42	Marty2000	Since I was Olimar after getting out of the cave
2016-05-05 23:09:00	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-05 23:12:38	Marty2000	Well, seems it doesn't hhave any impact, as you said...
2016-05-05 23:14:31	@Espyo	agh
2016-05-05 23:14:34	@Espyo	I wish I was wrong
2016-05-05 23:14:38	@Espyo	at least that way we'd find a pattern
2016-05-05 23:14:42	@Espyo	but nope, still nothing
2016-05-05 23:14:51	@Espyo	I'm starting to think it could be random, but determined at the start of the day
2016-05-05 23:15:02	Marty2000	That's what I'm thinking
2016-05-05 23:15:03	@Espyo	which explains why I kept getting the same result when I tried entering on different frames
2016-05-05 23:15:13	@Espyo	because the game already calculated the random number that would control that at the start of the day
2016-05-05 23:15:18	@Espyo	it's possible... but WHY?!
2016-05-05 23:15:29	@Espyo	if they wanted it to be random, they could use the standard randomness algorithm they have
2016-05-05 23:15:35	@Espyo	which depends on the frame in which whatever you want happens
2016-05-05 23:15:37	@Espyo	why the start of the day?
2016-05-05 23:15:47	@Espyo	but even then, it can't really be random...
2016-05-05 23:15:52	@Espyo	because we got the switch one time
2016-05-05 23:15:55	@Espyo	and then no switch four times
2016-05-05 23:16:06	@Espyo	since both of us got exactly the same, that's even more suspicious
2016-05-05 23:17:06	Marty2000	Right now, entering the Citadel of Spiders on day 360 as Olimar and throwing a Pikmin with Olimar before entering makes the game switch. That's just stupid, ha ha. But yes, I don't think it's random 
2016-05-05 23:17:15	Marty2000	We both got the same results like 5 times
2016-05-05 23:17:20	Marty2000	It can't be random
2016-05-05 23:17:48	Marty2000	I should mention that I haven't switched manually to the President yet

2016-05-05 23:26:38	Marty2000	Oh, I think this time I have found something
2016-05-05 23:26:40	Marty2000	Wait please
2016-05-05 23:27:10	@Espyo	ooh
2016-05-05 23:27:16	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:27:22	Marty2000	Can you play Pikmin right now?
2016-05-05 23:27:29	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-05 23:27:32	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-05 23:27:36	Marty2000	If it's possible
2016-05-05 23:27:48	Marty2000	Follow these instructions :
2016-05-05 23:27:58	Marty2000	Go to the Perplexing Pool
2016-05-05 23:28:03	Marty2000	You will start the day as Olimar
2016-05-05 23:28:12	Marty2000	Don't switch to the President
2016-05-05 23:28:27	Marty2000	Enter the Citadel of Spiders as Olimar
2016-05-05 23:28:34	Marty2000	It should switch to the President
2016-05-05 23:28:42	@Espyo	do I withdraw Pikmin without touching the President?
2016-05-05 23:28:49	Marty2000	You can whistle him
2016-05-05 23:29:01	Marty2000	Tell me when you are in the first sublevel of the cave
2016-05-05 23:29:08	Marty2000	Don't enter another sublevel
2016-05-05 23:29:15	@Espyo	sorry
2016-05-05 23:29:18	@Espyo	I followed your instructions
2016-05-05 23:29:24	@Espyo	but it kept Olimar when I entered the cave
2016-05-05 23:29:34	Marty2000	Really...
2016-05-05 23:29:37	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-05 23:29:41	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-05 23:29:46	Marty2000	Did you start the day?
2016-05-05 23:29:46	@Espyo	this game sure knows how to shut down theories
2016-05-05 23:29:55	Marty2000	Or continued one?
2016-05-05 23:30:00	@Espyo	started a new day
2016-05-05 23:30:10	Marty2000	Because here's what happened to me
2016-05-05 23:30:15	Marty2000	I followed these instructions
2016-05-05 23:30:28	Marty2000	And it always switched to the President when I exited through the pause menu
2016-05-05 23:30:34	Marty2000	to Olimar*
2016-05-05 23:30:46	Marty2000	And it alwyas swicthed to the President when entering the first subleevl
2016-05-05 23:30:51	Marty2000	sublevel*
2016-05-05 23:31:01	@Espyo	weird
2016-05-05 23:31:01	Marty2000	If I entered with the President, it kept the President
2016-05-05 23:31:12	Marty2000	And switched to Olimar when exiting through the pause menu
2016-05-05 23:31:13	Marty2000	But
2016-05-05 23:31:28	Marty2000	If I entered another subleel (2) with Olimar
2016-05-05 23:31:38	Marty2000	Then exited through the pause menu with Olimar
2016-05-05 23:31:42	Marty2000	And entered again,
2016-05-05 23:31:50	Marty2000	as Olimar or the President
2016-05-05 23:31:56	Marty2000	It would keep Olimar
2016-05-05 23:32:23	Marty2000	So I was wondering if entering another sublevel changed the way these things happen
2016-05-05 23:33:33	Marty2000	And look
2016-05-05 23:33:44	Marty2000	I've tried to enter sublevel 2 with the President
2016-05-05 23:33:50	Marty2000	And exited through the pause menu
2016-05-05 23:34:07	Marty2000	So when getting back on the surface, it switched to Olimar.
2016-05-05 23:34:15	Marty2000	But when entering, it switched to the President again
2016-05-05 23:34:27	Marty2000	So I wonder if this is not related
2016-05-05 23:34:40	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-05 23:35:02	@Espyo	I'm not sure
2016-05-05 23:35:22	@Espyo	we still get random switching if we enter the Emergence Cave right at the start of the day, so before any cave is exited
2016-05-05 23:36:48	Marty2000	Well, I think I have an explanation for at least the NPC version right now, because it always work if I follow the aforementioned instructions
2016-05-05 23:37:18	Marty2000	Can you try something for me on the gamecube version?
2016-05-05 23:37:33	Marty2000	If possible
2016-05-05 23:37:50	Marty2000	I'll verify my theory with the Emergence Cave
2016-05-05 23:38:45	@Espyo	sure
2016-05-05 23:38:56	Marty2000	Oh, finally, resetting the day doesn't change anything for me
2016-05-05 23:39:08	Marty2000	So I think I have the explanation 
2016-05-05 23:39:12	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-05 23:39:24	Marty2000	So strt a new day, go to the Perplexing Pool
2016-05-05 23:39:36	Marty2000	Enter the Citadel of Spiders as Olimar
2016-05-05 23:39:50	Marty2000	And tell me who you are when you have landed in the sublevel 1

2016-05-05 23:41:11	@Espyo	following those instructions, I'm controlling Olimar
2016-05-05 23:41:22	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-05 23:41:28	Marty2000	Exit through the pause menu
2016-05-05 23:41:34	Marty2000	And re-enter the cave
2016-05-05 23:41:43	Marty2000	You should be Olimar when landing in the first sublevel
2016-05-05 23:41:54	@Espyo	I'm controlling Olimar in the overworld
2016-05-05 23:41:58	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:42:06	Marty2000	And you normally will in the first sublevel
2016-05-05 23:42:11	Marty2000	Even if you enter as the President
2016-05-05 23:42:13	@Espyo	entered the cave again, I'm controlling Olimar
2016-05-05 23:42:22	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-05 23:42:33	Marty2000	Exit again, and re-enter a third time
2016-05-05 23:42:36	Marty2000	You should be Olimar
2016-05-05 23:42:41	Marty2000	Don't exit this time
2016-05-05 23:42:43	@Espyo	exit via pause, yeah?
2016-05-05 23:42:46	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:43:07	@Espyo	ok, I'm here a third time
2016-05-05 23:43:16	@Espyo	the game never once made me control the President throughout all this
2016-05-05 23:43:24	Marty2000	You are Olimar now, right
2016-05-05 23:43:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-05 23:43:27	Marty2000	That's normal
2016-05-05 23:43:37	Marty2000	Okay, enter the second sublevel as the President
2016-05-05 23:43:52	Marty2000	Normally, you should control the President 
2016-05-05 23:44:26	@Espyo	entered the second sublevel as the President, now I'm controlling the President still
2016-05-05 23:44:39	Marty2000	Exit via pause menu, and enter the cave as Olimar
2016-05-05 23:44:50	Marty2000	You should control the President when you have landed
2016-05-05 23:44:58	Marty2000	And be Olimar before entering
2016-05-05 23:45:27	@Espyo	oh!
2016-05-05 23:45:30	@Espyo	I am controlling the President
2016-05-05 23:45:35	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:45:40	Marty2000	That was expected
2016-05-05 23:45:59	@Espyo	hmmmm
2016-05-05 23:46:01	Marty2000	Exit via the pause menu, you will be controlling Olimar. Switch to the President and enter the cave
2016-05-05 23:46:07	Marty2000	You will be the President again
2016-05-05 23:46:10	Marty2000	But don't exit
2016-05-05 23:46:33	@Espyo	so far so good

2016-05-05 23:46:57	@Espyo	indeed
2016-05-05 23:47:03	Marty2000	Exit via pause menu
2016-05-05 23:47:10	Marty2000	Enter the cave again with Olimar
2016-05-05 23:47:18	Marty2000	And you will controlOlimiar...
2016-05-05 23:47:21	Marty2000	Olimar...*
2016-05-05 23:47:26	@Espyo	exactly!
2016-05-05 23:47:34	@Espyo	so... whenever you go down a sublevel
2016-05-05 23:47:38	Marty2000	Same if you entered as the President
2016-05-05 23:47:38	@Espyo	the game a) keeps your leader the same
2016-05-05 23:47:44	@Espyo	b) saves that leader in memory somewhere
2016-05-05 23:47:49	@Espyo	and when you enter a cave's first sublevel...
2016-05-05 23:47:56	@Espyo	it switches to the leader inside that bit of memory
2016-05-05 23:48:01	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:48:09	@Espyo	that is ABSOLUTELY dumb
2016-05-05 23:48:10	@Espyo	but
2016-05-05 23:48:13	Marty2000	He he, I think we've solved it!
2016-05-05 23:48:14	@Espyo	it seems to be a pattern all right
2016-05-05 23:48:16	@Espyo	yes!
2016-05-05 23:48:19	@Espyo	well... almost all of it
2016-05-05 23:48:31	@Espyo	we solved what decides which leader to switch to when the cave is entered
2016-05-05 23:48:34	Marty2000	Yes, we have to test with geysers...
2016-05-05 23:48:39	@Espyo	on the 2nd or after times
2016-05-05 23:48:42	@Espyo	what about on the first time of the day?
2016-05-05 23:48:45	@Espyo	it still seems to be random
2016-05-05 23:48:48	Marty2000	No
2016-05-05 23:48:50	@Espyo	also, I'll try different caves tomorrow to check
2016-05-05 23:48:56	Marty2000	You are Oimar right now?
2016-05-05 23:49:02	@Espyo	I am
2016-05-05 23:49:06	Marty2000	When entering, are you Olimar?
2016-05-05 23:49:08	Marty2000	If yes
2016-05-05 23:49:15	Marty2000	Exit via the pause menu
2016-05-05 23:49:18	Marty2000	Finish the day
2016-05-05 23:49:25	Marty2000	Land on the P.P again
2016-05-05 23:49:30	Marty2000	Enter the citadel of Spiders again
2016-05-05 23:49:34	Marty2000	And you should bez Olimar
2016-05-05 23:49:48	Marty2000	It keeps the leader in memory over days
2016-05-05 23:49:53	Marty2000	be*

2016-05-05 23:50:19	@Espyo	that's right
2016-05-05 23:50:28	@Espyo	but, I wonder if it saves between save files, too
2016-05-05 23:50:36	@Espyo	but that's very likely what's going on
2016-05-05 23:50:43	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:50:46	@Espyo	hm, Yoshi2 is already offline
2016-05-05 23:50:51	@Espyo	but I think I could get to the bottom of this then
2016-05-05 23:51:03	@Espyo	I can probably find the memory address that remembers the last leader that went down a hole
2016-05-05 23:51:17	@Espyo	but I want to know if there's some way to know when the game READS that memory address
2016-05-05 23:51:23	@Espyo	if it reads while doing the cave loading
2016-05-05 23:51:32	@Espyo	then yes, it is remembering the last leader that travelled down a hole
2016-05-05 23:51:33	Marty2000	Be right back
2016-05-05 23:51:38	@Espyo	ok
2016-05-05 23:51:43	Marty2000	But I think it's likely that
2016-05-05 23:51:47	@Espyo	I might go to bed soon, though
2016-05-05 23:53:49	Marty2000	Back
2016-05-05 23:53:50	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-05 23:54:01	Marty2000	See you soon then!
2016-05-05 23:54:32	@Espyo	oh, I thought you'd take longer to come back
2016-05-05 23:54:35	@Espyo	ok, so
2016-05-05 23:54:41	@Espyo	this seems to make sense
2016-05-05 23:54:44	@Espyo	but I wonder two things
2016-05-05 23:54:52	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-05 23:54:56	@Espyo	a) what happens between save files? does the game keep track of the last leader to enter a sublevel between saves?
2016-05-05 23:55:08	Marty2000	I can try right now
2016-05-05 23:55:09	@Espyo	b) what about the very first cave you entered in the game before ever going into a sublevel?
2016-05-05 23:55:14	Marty2000	First savefile :
2016-05-05 23:55:16	@Espyo	the answer to b) is very likely Olimar

2016-05-05 23:55:32	Marty2000	I'll enter the second sublevel as Olimar
2016-05-05 23:55:36	@Espyo	I think the easiest way to test a)
2016-05-05 23:55:39	Marty2000	Second savefile : we'll see
2016-05-05 23:55:49	Marty2000	Then : back to the first savefile :
2016-05-05 23:55:57	Marty2000	I'll enter the second sublevel as the President
2016-05-05 23:56:08	Marty2000	Second savefile : see what happens (switch to Louie)
2016-05-05 23:56:14	@Espyo	is to enter a sublevel as the President, quit the cave, end the day, save, reboot the game, check again on the next day
2016-05-05 23:56:31	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-05 23:56:45	Marty2000	If you enter the second sublevel as the President
2016-05-05 23:56:48	Marty2000	And finish the day
2016-05-05 23:56:54	Marty2000	The next day, when entering a cave
2016-05-05 23:56:58	Marty2000	It will switch to the President
2016-05-05 23:57:02	Marty2000	Already tried
2016-05-05 23:57:02	@Espyo	if after that you start the cave as the President, then the game saves
2016-05-05 23:57:12	@Espyo	if you start with Olimar, the game doesn't save, and defaults to Olimar
2016-05-05 23:57:17	@Espyo	if it doesn't switch, there's more jank
2016-05-05 23:57:32	@Espyo	yeah, but what about with a game reboot after finishing the day?
2016-05-05 23:57:37	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-05 23:57:42	Marty2000	I'll try as well
2016-05-05 23:57:53	Marty2000	Trying the memory between saves right now
2016-05-05 23:58:36	Marty2000	Memory : The President will be controlled when entering the first sublevel of a cave
2016-05-05 23:58:44	Marty2000	Rebooting the game right now...
2016-05-05 23:59:19	Marty2000	Checking with the same save
2016-05-05 23:59:33	Marty2000	I am the President
2016-05-05 23:59:37	Marty2000	I exited the cave again
2016-05-06 00:00:05	Marty2000	And I'm the President again
2016-05-06 00:00:07	Marty2000	So
2016-05-06 00:00:22	Marty2000	"The memory is kept even after rebooting the game"
2016-05-06 00:00:26	@Espyo	wait, did you reboot the game while in the middle of a cave?
2016-05-06 00:00:37	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-06 00:00:41	@Espyo	oh, I don't think that will work
2016-05-06 00:00:50	@Espyo	because the game might save your current leader
2016-05-06 00:01:03	@Espyo	so when you reload, it starts the "sublevel entrance" sequence using the current leader it has memorized
2016-05-06 00:01:16	@Espyo	and that pollutes the "last leader to enter a sublevel" variable
2016-05-06 00:01:20	@Espyo	try rebooting while on the overworld
2016-05-06 00:01:22	Marty2000	Oh, do you want me to reboot when on the surface?
2016-05-06 00:01:25	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-06 00:01:26	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 00:01:27	@Espyo	actually
2016-05-06 00:01:31	@Espyo	that could pollute it too
2016-05-06 00:01:38	@Espyo	reboot on the area select screen
2016-05-06 00:01:43	Marty2000	Wait, I'm trying the memory and different saves
2016-05-06 00:01:50	@Espyo	that way, when you load, the game won't touch the "last leader to enter a sublevel" variable
2016-05-06 00:01:57	@Espyo	oh, good idea
2016-05-06 00:02:02	@Espyo	I really have to go now, I'm pretty tired
2016-05-06 00:02:06	@Espyo	but I can't wait to hear your results
2016-05-06 00:02:06	Marty2000	Second save
2016-05-06 00:02:11	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-06 00:02:17	@Espyo	or you can call it quits for now and we can continue to work on this together tomorrow
2016-05-06 00:02:28	Marty2000	I'll write them down if you want
2016-05-06 00:02:36	@Espyo	might as well
2016-05-06 00:03:02	@Espyo	wait, on the wiki? I think we should wait until we've got a final conclusion about everything
2016-05-06 00:03:12	@Espyo	but you can point it down on like your userpage or something so you don't forget these findings
2016-05-06 00:03:15	Marty2000	I have time to try, so I'll try some time before going to bed. I'll write everything and I'll tell you tomorrow. Is that okay?
2016-05-06 00:03:20	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-06 00:03:33	Marty2000	I'll write them on my user page
2016-05-06 00:03:58	@Espyo	sure

I could also test with the JPN version of Pikmin 2, and it didn't change anything, so I think we can conlude it's the same for all regions and all versions

2016-05-06 19:19:55	@Espyo	so the chiyogami can also make you throw LESS high?
2016-05-06 19:19:59	@Espyo	good grief, this game

2016-05-06 19:21:07	Marty2000	Yes Espyo
2016-05-06 19:21:14	Marty2000	We'll have to modify the article
2016-05-06 19:21:18	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 19:21:21	Marty2000	And it depends on where your cursor is

2016-05-06 19:21:40	Bulborbs_At_View	What's the chiyogami?

2016-05-06 19:29:11	Marty2000	Explorer's Cave
2016-05-06 19:29:16	Marty2000	Sublevel 1 : I land as Olimar
2016-05-06 19:29:21	Marty2000	Before entering the sublevel 2
2016-05-06 19:29:25	Marty2000	I switch to Louie
2016-05-06 19:29:31	Marty2000	So I enter the sublevel 2 as Louie
2016-05-06 19:29:43	Marty2000	And I land as... Olimar
2016-05-06 19:29:50	Marty2000	So I guess Challenge Mode has different rules
2016-05-06 19:32:45	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-06 19:32:50	Marty2000	Ok, so
2016-05-06 19:32:57	Marty2000	No matter what you do in the CHllange Mode
2016-05-06 19:33:04	Marty2000	You will always land as Olimar

2016-05-06 19:38:42	Marty2000	By the way, even if you enter the hole as Louie, during the cutscene, the player will see Olimar jumping first
2016-05-06 19:38:49	Marty2000	How strange...
2016-05-06 19:39:58	@Espyo	yeah

2016-05-06 19:40:38	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-06 19:40:39	Marty2000	Still, you will always play Olimar first in 1 player

2016-05-06 20:01:33	@Espyo	ok, so the conclusion is that the game really keeps track of the last leader to jump a sublevel
2016-05-06 20:01:39	@Espyo	and then uses that to decide the leader that lands on the cave
2016-05-06 20:01:41	@Espyo	is that it?

2016-05-06 20:12:10	@Espyo	I've got 10 address that change to 0 or 1 in accordance to the last leader to go down

2016-05-06 20:15:45	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-06 20:15:47	@Espyo	and 0x00B74C38 changed when I landed
2016-05-06 20:15:58	@Espyo	I'll create codes to see if I can force the leader
2016-05-06 20:15:58	@Espyo	and if so, we found the variable
2016-05-06 20:15:58	@Espyo	and everything makes sense

2016-05-06 20:19:29	@Espyo	 0x00942A0C is the variable

2016-05-06 20:20:41	@Espyo	ok, so
2016-05-06 20:20:48	@Espyo	the entire saga, summed up to my understanding:
2016-05-06 20:20:59	Marty2000	There's nothing about it in the "did you know"
2016-05-06 20:21:06	Marty2000	Oh, you have the variable
2016-05-06 20:21:09	Marty2000	Cool
2016-05-06 20:21:10	--	UM is now known as UltraMario
2016-05-06 20:21:11	@Espyo	there is a variable in memory that controls what leader will be the active one whenever you enter a sublevel
2016-05-06 20:21:24	@Espyo	this variable is saved in the save data
2016-05-06 20:21:48	Marty2000	Ok
2016-05-06 20:21:53	@Espyo	whenever the player enters a cave or sublevel, it reads this variable to determine what leader to make active
2016-05-06 20:22:15	@Espyo	however, it only sets this variable when the player jumps down from one sublevel to the next, using the value of the current active leader
2016-05-06 20:22:21	@Espyo	meaning... it's a glitch
2016-05-06 20:22:32	@Espyo	the game was meant to also set the variable when the player enters a cave
2016-05-06 20:22:43	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-06 20:22:49	@Espyo	so that when it's time to start the first sublevel of the cave, the game would read the written value and pick that leader
2016-05-06 20:22:54	@Espyo	the game does the reading part all right
2016-05-06 20:22:57	@Espyo	but not the writing part
2016-05-06 20:23:14	@Espyo	so the value that is in memory is an old one, set from way back whenever the last jump from a sublevel was
2016-05-06 20:23:40	@Espyo	so in short... to decide what leader to make active, the game checks a variable that only gets set when jumping a sublevel, not when entering
2016-05-06 20:23:44	@Espyo	leading to the wrong leader getting set
2016-05-06 20:23:45	Marty2000	Well, good stuff anyway! We finally have a clear explanation
2016-05-06 20:23:49	@Espyo	yes!
2016-05-06 20:23:51	@Espyo	I'm so happy
2016-05-06 20:23:57	@Espyo	even though it's so unimportant
2016-05-06 20:24:10	Marty2000	so am I. Yes, maybe not so important
2016-05-06 20:24:18	Marty2000	But the game has so many little mysteries
2016-05-06 20:24:41	Marty2000	That's it's good to find an explanation for all of them
2016-05-06 20:25:18	Marty2000	That*
2016-05-06 20:26:33	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 20:26:35	@Espyo	and fun, too
2016-05-06 20:26:44	@Espyo	and I hope that people who read on this will also find it interesting
2016-05-06 20:27:58	@Espyo	well, this is technically a glitch
2016-05-06 20:28:03	@Espyo	a complete flaw in the game's code
2016-05-06 20:28:24	@Espyo	whatever function controls the procedure to enter a cave is missing some instruction to set the variable
2016-05-06 20:28:33	@Espyo	but the code to go down a sublevel has that instruction
2016-05-06 20:28:42	@Espyo	so... I guess it goes into the glitches article
2016-05-06 20:28:46	Marty2000	I didn't think it was a glitch firsthand
2016-05-06 20:28:52	Marty2000	But now, it makes sene
2016-05-06 20:28:54	Marty2000	sense*
2016-05-06 20:29:22	Marty2000	That also explains why you always play as Olimar when exiting a cave, right?
2016-05-06 20:29:55	@Espyo	not really
2016-05-06 20:30:07	@Espyo	when you exit a cave, the game just sets your active leader to Olimar regardless of everything
2016-05-06 20:30:14	@Espyo	it's not related to the variable that gets set wrong
2016-05-06 20:30:16	Marty2000	Oh, okay
2016-05-06 20:30:27	@Espyo	that variable is only used to decide the active leader at the start of a sublevel
2016-05-06 20:31:02	Marty2000	What about the Challenge Mode? Regardless of everything, you'll always play as Olimar at first
2016-05-06 20:31:16	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-06 20:31:24	@Espyo	well, I'd bet it's the same logic
2016-05-06 20:31:33	@Espyo	the game saves on the variable what leader you entered the sublevel with
2016-05-06 20:31:43	@Espyo	so that after the loading screen, it reads the variable and sets your active leader
2016-05-06 20:31:55	@Espyo	there's no mess with the first sublevel because, like you said, it's always set as Olimar
2016-05-06 20:32:05	Marty2000	Yes, but
2016-05-06 20:32:07	@Espyo	the function that starts a challenge has an instruction to set the active leader to Olimar, likely
2016-05-06 20:32:20	Marty2000	if you enter the second sublevel as Louie, you will again play with Olimar
2016-05-06 20:32:34	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-06 20:33:06	@Espyo	oh, will you?
2016-05-06 20:33:08	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-06 20:33:13	@Espyo	I can check what the game does to the variable
2016-05-06 20:33:39	Marty2000	Well, it is different for the Challenge Mode
2016-05-06 20:33:48	@Espyo	it could share the variable, though
2016-05-06 20:34:37	Marty2000	It doesn't share any variable with the Story Mode saves, though, so I can't explain why it always switches to Olimar whatever the player does
2016-05-06 20:35:22	Marty2000	(in Challenge Mode)
2016-05-06 20:36:09	@Espyo	well, not the saves
2016-05-06 20:36:11	@Espyo	but in memory

This is true regardless of the leaders that are actually on the party and the order at which they jump in, but if the second leader is fallen, only the first leader's grunt will play (still with Olimar's voice).

2016-05-06 20:43:01	@Espyo	they didn't even think that the leader order could be switched
2016-05-06 20:43:10	Marty2000	Ah, okay, lol.
2016-05-06 20:43:54	@Espyo	oh, ok, it doesn't mess with that variable
2016-05-06 20:43:55	@Espyo	I think I know what's up
2016-05-06 20:44:05	@Espyo	from a programming view, it doesn't make sense to have a variable specifically for this
2016-05-06 20:44:15	@Espyo	you have a variable for the active leader (0 or 1), and that's it
2016-05-06 20:44:31	@Espyo	when you enter a sublevel, you go through the loading screen, and then check which leader to use
2016-05-06 20:44:37	@Espyo	you just use that same "active leader" variable
2016-05-06 20:44:40	@Espyo	that you use throughout the entire game
2016-05-06 20:44:41	@Espyo	BUT
2016-05-06 20:44:53	@Espyo	this new "last leader to go down a hole" variable exists... simply because of the saved game
2016-05-06 20:45:01	@Espyo	because when you go down a sublevel and the game saves
2016-05-06 20:45:09	@Espyo	if you reload, you get the same leader you were going to get, right?
2016-05-06 20:45:14	Marty2000	Yesd
2016-05-06 20:45:16	Marty2000	Yes*
2016-05-06 20:45:20	@Espyo	that's because the game saves that variable, and for that, the variable has to, well, exist
2016-05-06 20:45:22	@Espyo	that's why it exists
2016-05-06 20:45:27	@Espyo	either way
2016-05-06 20:45:33	@Espyo	they figured they didn't need that for Challenge Mode
2016-05-06 20:45:35	@Espyo	because there's no saving or loading
2016-05-06 20:45:43	@Espyo	so it just uses the "current active leader" variable for everything
2016-05-06 20:45:46	Marty2000	Oh, I see
2016-05-06 20:45:46	@Espyo	and everything works
2016-05-06 20:45:56	Marty2000	Thanks.
2016-05-06 20:49:34	Marty2000	The next mystery that we will have to solve, next, is : "Purple Pikmin seem to be immune to ink."
2016-05-06 20:49:43	Marty2000	But I don't have the required tools to test
2016-05-06 20:49:51	Marty2000	I'm just nearly sure that they're immune to ink
2016-05-06 20:50:04	UltraMario	hey marty
2016-05-06 20:50:09	UltraMario	you up for some practice today?
2016-05-06 20:50:10	Marty2000	Hi UltraMario
2016-05-06 20:50:19	Marty2000	I can practice a little, if you want
2016-05-06 20:50:53	Marty2000	And to prove what I say: I could get a Sputtlefish out of water
2016-05-06 20:51:01	UltraMario	yay
2016-05-06 20:51:02	Marty2000	I had posted a screenshot of that here once
2016-05-06 20:51:15	Marty2000	And Purples didn't get inked
2016-05-06 20:51:37	Marty2000	UltraMario: if you're available right now, please make the room
2016-05-06 20:52:14	UltraMario	sure
2016-05-06 20:52:15	UltraMario	sorry
2016-05-06 20:52:20	UltraMario	gotta boot it up
2016-05-06 20:52:31	Marty2000	I can wait, no worries
2016-05-06 20:52:44	@Espyo	hehe
2016-05-06 20:52:48	@Espyo	maybe one day we'll figure it out
2016-05-06 20:53:46	Marty2000	What about Pikmin 3 hack? I guess it's not possible yet to have both a Toady Bloyster and a Purple Pikmin in the same area
2016-05-06 20:54:05	@Espyo	well, it might be
2016-05-06 20:54:09	@Espyo	I mean, the Wii U is hackable
2016-05-06 20:54:15	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-06 20:54:22	@Espyo	and actually, a recent exploit was released that works on the most recent version of the firmware (I think)
2016-05-06 20:54:34	@Espyo	either way, CEMU is under development, and we might be able to use that to load hacked games
2016-05-06 20:54:44	@Espyo	Cemu is the emulator for the Wii U
2016-05-06 20:54:58	UltraMario	btw
2016-05-06 20:54:58	UltraMario	marty
2016-05-06 20:55:00	UltraMario	did you know
2016-05-06 20:55:15	Marty2000	Okay / Yes?
2016-05-06 20:55:17	UltraMario	there used to be a glitch that let you play special smash online?
2016-05-06 20:55:18	UltraMario	:'(
2016-05-06 20:55:25	Marty2000	Yes, I could test it 
2016-05-06 20:55:30	UltraMario	it's patched
2016-05-06 20:55:31	Marty2000	That was great
2016-05-06 20:55:35	UltraMario	im pretty sure
2016-05-06 20:55:36	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-06 20:55:40	UltraMario	if it was still there
2016-05-06 20:55:42	Marty2000	Yes it's patched
2016-05-06 20:55:45	UltraMario	i wouldve allowed it for the tourney
2016-05-06 20:55:48	UltraMario	D:
2016-05-06 20:55:55	Marty2000	Like Mewtwo's glitched custom moves
2016-05-06 20:55:57	UltraMario	they should put that in smash 5
2016-05-06 20:56:56	Marty2000	Oh, espyo, I can see the latest firmware hack on a website
2016-05-06 20:56:58	@Espyo	<Marty2000> That was great
2016-05-06 20:56:59	@Espyo	this ^
2016-05-06 20:56:59	Marty2000	I'll check later
2016-05-06 20:58:27	Marty2000	I think they should have included that in the final game, that would have the Friend Mode even better
2016-05-06 20:58:41	Marty2000	have made*
2016-05-06 20:58:58	UltraMario	playing as g&w
2016-05-06 20:59:09	UltraMario	with the no parachute custom
2016-05-06 20:59:09	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-06 20:59:14	Marty2000	Oh, I remember something very funny about a character
2016-05-06 20:59:29	Marty2000	I used to meet a friend in For Fun (it's pôssible)
2016-05-06 20:59:32	Marty2000	possible*
2016-05-06 20:59:38	Bulborbs_At_View	So I'm working on a banner for Pikmin X-3... does anyone mind if I post it here for feedback?
2016-05-06 20:59:40	Marty2000	He used Samus, and I used Game and Watch
2016-05-06 20:59:45	@Espyo	Bulborbs_At_View: sure
2016-05-06 20:59:51	Marty2000	Sure
2016-05-06 21:00:07	UltraMario	oops
2016-05-06 21:00:08	UltraMario	wrong alt
2016-05-06 21:00:09	UltraMario	:V
2016-05-06 21:00:14	Marty2000	So with Samus, he would use his neutral special attack... and as Game and Watch, I would use the bucket

2016-05-06 21:01:55	Bulborbs_At_View	It's pretty heavily inspired by this forum's banner... xD
2016-05-06 21:02:16	Bulborbs_At_View	The stretched out part is only to avoid looping from occuring
2016-05-06 21:03:02	@Espyo	looks neat, though Olimar's limbs are too stretched out
2016-05-06 21:03:13	@Espyo	well, mostly the arms
2016-05-06 21:03:14	@Espyo	the legs are fine

2016-05-06 21:03:48	Bulborbs_At_View	So I should make them smaller?
2016-05-06 21:05:02	@Espyo	that will work, yeah
2016-05-06 21:05:09	@Espyo	or make them a bit more bent at the elbow
2016-05-06 21:10:06	Bulborbs_At_View	Alright, I tried to make the arms look slightly better: http://s32.postimg.org/4jc7b59j9/rect6909.png
2016-05-06 21:10:33	Bulborbs_At_View	Don't know if it changed much.

2016-05-06 21:23:20	@PikFan	oh, for—right
2016-05-06 21:23:41	Bulborbs_At_View	Espyo mentioned the arms were a bit odd on Olimar so I changed it to this version
2016-05-06 21:24:38	@PikFan	huh, how come there aren't any Purple or Whites?
2016-05-06 21:24:59	Bulborbs_At_View	I could add them, but they're not part of the starting choice Pikmin.
2016-05-06 21:25:12	@PikFan	hmm, I see
2016-05-06 21:25:26	Bulborbs_At_View	Because they're somewhat OP, and so I wanted to keep them more special (only obtained through Candypop Buds which are rather rare)
2016-05-06 21:26:10	@Espyo	Bulborbs_At_View: I'd say it looks better
2016-05-06 21:26:12	@PikFan	ah

2016-05-06 21:27:43	@Espyo	me and Marty tried to figure out exactly what's up with Pikmin 2 randomly switching what your active leader is when you enter the first sublevel of a cave
2016-05-06 21:27:49	@Espyo	you might've noticed the edits yesterday
2016-05-06 21:27:53	@PikFan	I did
2016-05-06 21:27:57	@Espyo	our conclusion was yesterday was "this game is so janky, we just don't know"
2016-05-06 21:28:00	@Espyo	but today!
2016-05-06 21:28:01	Bulborbs_At_View	Whoops, accidentally switched out of chat...
2016-05-06 21:28:11	@Espyo	Marty studied some more, I made some final checks
2016-05-06 21:28:13	@PikFan	I've always wondered that myself but I never really paid much attention to it
2016-05-06 21:28:16	@Espyo	and lo and behold, we cracked the code
2016-05-06 21:28:25	@Espyo	yeah, I don't think anybody did
2016-05-06 21:28:30	@Espyo	but we just decided it'd be fun to tackle to mystery, so we did
2016-05-06 21:28:33	@PikFan	except for Marty
2016-05-06 21:28:34	@Espyo	and dammit, we got it good

2016-05-06 21:30:59	Marty2000	Espyo helped me
2016-05-06 21:31:02	@Espyo	but none of you play it, so you wouldn't get it...

2016-05-06 21:31:38	@Espyo	oh, nice
2016-05-06 21:31:47	@Espyo	well, the joke was just that you're good at noticing Kellam :P
2016-05-06 21:32:14	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-06 21:32:37	Marty2000	By the way, greeat explanation for the leader thing... I wouldn't have been able to explain it correctly
2016-05-06 21:32:52	@PikFan	hey, if you guys can figure that out...
2016-05-06 21:33:15	@PikFan	then can you figure out the weird noises in P1's loading screen?
2016-05-06 21:33:23	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-06 21:33:27	@Espyo	I hope it's simple enough to understand...
2016-05-06 21:33:34	@PikFan	you know, how the "Pikmin!" is replaced by other sounds occasionally
2016-05-06 21:33:47	@Espyo	I don't think so... it's just a matter of booting the game a LOT of times till you get stuff
2016-05-06 21:33:56	@Espyo	I tried booting some 200 times to try to get statistics
2016-05-06 21:33:58	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-06 21:34:02	@Espyo	but of course I died of boredom halfway through
2016-05-06 21:34:12	@PikFan	heh
2016-05-06 21:34:53	@PikFan	wait, so
2016-05-06 21:35:20	@PikFan	if the game picks the leader that had last jumped into a hole...
2016-05-06 21:35:44	@PikFan	(by hole I mean the hole aboveground)
2016-05-06 21:35:52	@PikFan	then what about the Emergence Cave?
2016-05-06 21:36:03	@PikFan	would the game just pick whichever leader is active?
2016-05-06 21:36:47	Marty2000	What mysteries would you like to be solved?
2016-05-06 21:36:51	Marty2000	I can help if needed
2016-05-06 21:37:25	@Espyo	it's on the next paragraph
2016-05-06 21:37:32	@Espyo	on a new save, the variable is set to Olimar
2016-05-06 21:37:53	@Espyo	meaning that until you go down from EC1 to EC2 (which is what sets the variable), the variable will always be Olimar
2016-05-06 21:37:54	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-06 21:38:01	@Espyo	meaning you will ALWAYS switch to Olimar when entering the EC
2016-05-06 21:38:16	@Espyo	(again, until you go down a hole, at which point it gets set to either Olimar or Louie)
2016-05-06 21:38:27	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-06 21:38:33	@Espyo	I fear that this glitch may not be immediately understandable to others
2016-05-06 21:38:38	@Espyo	it is to me and Marty because of all the mad science we did
2016-05-06 21:38:41	@Espyo	we got the concept down
2016-05-06 21:38:50	@Espyo	but most everybody else is being a bit confused by it...
2016-05-06 21:38:58	@Espyo	but it looks as though it gets better with time
2016-05-06 21:39:04	@Espyo	it just takes a bit to understand the contexts and all
2016-05-06 21:39:56	@PikFan	so when a leader jumps into a hole, that sets the new variable?
2016-05-06 21:40:12	@PikFan	like if Olimar jumps into a hole, that sets the variable to 0?
2016-05-06 21:40:44	@PikFan	and the variable is used the NEXT time a leader jumps into a hole?
2016-05-06 21:40:55	@Espyo	that sets THE variable
2016-05-06 21:41:00	@Espyo	(to a NEW value)
2016-05-06 21:41:06	@Espyo	yep, exactly
2016-05-06 21:41:21	@Espyo	like, it's read to decide what leader to switch to (on sublevel 1, sublevel 2, whatever)
2016-05-06 21:41:25	@PikFan	so really, all of this is just a delayed reaction
2016-05-06 21:41:29	@Espyo	but is only WRITTEN on sublevel 2->3, 3->4, etc.
2016-05-06 21:41:38	@Espyo	so if you enter a cave, it doesn't WRITE to it, and READS the old value
2016-05-06 21:41:45	@Espyo	you could put it like that, yeah
2016-05-06 21:41:58	@PikFan	I see
2016-05-06 21:42:05	@Espyo	yikes, twitter is scary
2016-05-06 21:42:10	@Espyo	I tweeted about this discovery
2016-05-06 21:42:10	@PikFan	Pikmin 2 never ceases to amaze me
2016-05-06 21:42:13	@Espyo	 1 minute in, already 1 like
2016-05-06 21:42:19	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 is a marvel of modern science
2016-05-06 21:42:22	@PikFan	lol, why is that scary?
2016-05-06 21:42:24	Marty2000	Oh, good
2016-05-06 21:42:34	@Espyo	that like was so... FAST
2016-05-06 21:43:00	@PikFan	when I post on facebook (don't ask why I use it) I usually get a like in a minute or so
2016-05-06 21:43:21	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-06 21:43:23	@Espyo	well, I guess
2016-05-06 21:43:45	@PikFan	somebody just happened to be on, probably
2016-05-06 21:43:48	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 21:43:55	@Espyo	or got a notification on their phone
2016-05-06 21:44:07	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-06 21:46:10	@PikFan	ugh, Japanese is weird
2016-05-06 21:46:38	@PikFan	so there was another Splatoon concert in Japan recently, and Callie and Marie did a solo each
2016-05-06 21:46:56	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 21:47:00	@PikFan	the Japanese name of Marie's solo is スミソアエの夜
2016-05-06 21:47:00	@Espyo	and I guess amiibo got announce
2016-05-06 21:47:01	@Espyo	*d
2016-05-06 21:47:12	@PikFan	which reads "Sumisoae no Yoru"
2016-05-06 21:47:31	@PikFan	"Yoru" means "night", and "no" is "of"
2016-05-06 21:47:40	@PikFan	but nonody knows what "sumisoae" means
2016-05-06 21:47:43	@PikFan	*nobody
2016-05-06 21:47:47	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-06 21:47:59	@Espyo	I could swear these titles already had translations
2016-05-06 21:48:05	@PikFan	and since it's in katakana, I thought it'd be a loanword, or something
2016-05-06 21:48:18	@PikFan	but it's not an English loanword
2016-05-06 21:48:32	@PikFan	it could be a loanword from another language, but I have no idea
2016-05-06 21:48:48	@PikFan	I meant to ask my Japanese teacher about it today, but I forgot
2016-05-06 21:49:30	@PikFan	so right now, the translation is just "Night of Sumisoae"
2016-05-06 21:49:58	Marty2000	Oh Espyo, did you mention that when entering a cave for the first time, you will always start as Olimar?
2016-05-06 21:50:38	@Espyo	well, that's what your tests concluded, right?

2016-05-06 21:59:41	Marty2000	what about other mysteries to solve?
2016-05-06 21:59:47	Marty2000	Is there anything (besides the Purples and ink)?

2016-05-06 22:02:34	Marty2000	I noted it here to remember it
2016-05-06 22:03:04	@Espyo	there's still hundreds of mysteries
2016-05-06 22:03:07	@Espyo	but I can't think of anything
2016-05-06 22:03:22	@Espyo	yeah, that one's likely not a glitch
2016-05-06 22:03:28	@Espyo	it's not an incorrect behavior

2016-05-06 22:33:36	Marty2000	A Splatfest about Miitomo...
2016-05-06 22:33:45	Marty2000	The theme is good
2016-05-06 22:34:12	Marty2000	What theme will you choose, PikFan, Espyo? (and other who have Splatoon here)
2016-05-06 22:34:34	Marty2000	I think I'm going for the "black tie event" team
2016-05-06 22:34:35	@PikFan	mmmmm
2016-05-06 22:34:37	@Espyo	I'll go with costume
2016-05-06 22:34:43	@Espyo	not a fan of plain formal
2016-05-06 22:34:48	@Espyo	I mean, I can be formal, and enjoy a good formal event
2016-05-06 22:34:56	@Espyo	but as a party, I'd much rather do something wacky
2016-05-06 22:35:00	@PikFan	yeah, I WOULD go with costume
2016-05-06 22:35:05	@Espyo	than being all clean and formal and organized and eeeeessh
2016-05-06 22:35:09	@Espyo	not much of a party, is it?
2016-05-06 22:35:10	@Espyo	more like an event
2016-05-06 22:35:14	@PikFan	but see, costume is probably going to lose
2016-05-06 22:35:19	Marty2000	Well, we'll be against
2016-05-06 22:35:25	Marty2000	But parties are good too
2016-05-06 22:35:39	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-06 22:35:44	@Espyo	most kids might pick costume, yes
2016-05-06 22:35:50	@Espyo	as if a kid would ever prefer a formal party
2016-05-06 22:36:15	@PikFan	all I care about is winning
2016-05-06 22:36:19	@PikFan	so shallow, I know...
2016-05-06 22:36:29	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-06 22:36:34	@Espyo	I have so many Snails
2016-05-06 22:36:51	@Espyo	I just care about enjoying the song and the beautiful night-time events
2016-05-06 22:36:55	@Espyo	...well, dusk
2016-05-06 22:36:55	@PikFan	I had no idea about last Splatfest
2016-05-06 22:37:03	Marty2000	Ah the song... it's great, isn't it?
2016-05-06 22:37:06	@Espyo	sure is
2016-05-06 22:37:19	@PikFan	I saw so many people talking about Patrick, so you know, I thought Patrick was the more popular team
2016-05-06 22:37:29	@PikFan	I couldn't have been any more wrong
2016-05-06 22:37:54	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-06 22:37:56	@PikFan	and as a result, I paid the price
2016-05-06 22:38:01	@PikFan	still got 18 snails, which was nice
2016-05-06 22:38:08	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 22:38:13	Marty2000	I also got surprised when I saw the Spongebob team more popular

2016-05-06 22:39:21	@PikFan	this theme's a little more clear to me
2016-05-06 22:39:31	@PikFan	but I wonder how I'll do...
2016-05-06 22:39:51	@PikFan	actually, what surprised me the most was how soon this Splatfest was announced
2016-05-06 22:40:46	Marty2000	What team did you pick up for "Pineapple on pizza' or "no pineapple"?
2016-05-06 22:40:54	@Espyo	no pineapple
2016-05-06 22:40:56	@Espyo	I don't like fruit
2016-05-06 22:41:14	Marty2000	I felt alone during this Splatfest, but I used two accounts
2016-05-06 22:41:47	Marty2000	On my main account, I took "pineapple on pizza", and when I reached King title, I took another account to play in the other team...
2016-05-06 22:42:13	Marty2000	That was fun but it's quite tiring to get the title twice
2016-05-06 22:42:50	@PikFan	yuck, pineapple on pizza
2016-05-06 22:42:58	@PikFan	I would kill it with fire immediately
2016-05-06 22:43:14	@PikFan	and then burn the ashes just to be sure
2016-05-06 22:43:21	@Espyo	wow this Tabuu user is weird
2016-05-06 22:43:26	@Espyo	asked Porple the same question twice
2016-05-06 22:43:29	@Espyo	even though he already replied
2016-05-06 22:43:35	@Espyo	and asking me to censor an edit summary from 2014
2016-05-06 22:44:06	Marty2000	Really?
2016-05-06 22:44:30	Marty2000	Well, I say "really?" because it surprises me
2016-05-06 22:45:10	@Espyo	heh, yep
2016-05-06 22:45:18	@Espyo	it DOES make sense to censor it
2016-05-06 22:45:22	@Espyo	since the edit summary has swears
2016-05-06 22:45:24	@Espyo	but ugh, come on
2016-05-06 22:45:26	@Espyo	who's gonna notice it?
2016-05-06 22:45:44	@PikFan	wait, did you remove them already
2016-05-06 22:45:48	@Espyo	I did
2016-05-06 22:45:51	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-06 22:45:53	@PikFan	what did they say
2016-05-06 22:46:03	@Espyo	unless you either check the recent changes from several months ago, check the history of specifically that article, or check the block log specifically in search of vandals, you're not gonna even see those edit summaries
2016-05-06 22:46:10	@Espyo	something like THIS FRANCHISE IS FUCKING BULLSHIT
2016-05-06 22:46:10	Testyo	Hey, don't swear!
2016-05-06 22:46:14	@Espyo	thanks, Testyo
2016-05-06 22:46:14	Testyo	I replaced it, but the new one broke too, very quickly, so it was somehow killing hard drives
2016-05-06 22:46:21	@PikFan	lol
2016-05-06 22:46:23	@Espyo	...that sounds dangerous
2016-05-06 22:46:26	@Espyo	hell are you doing, Testyo?

2016-05-06 22:46:32	@PikFan	oh boy
2016-05-06 22:47:14	@PikFan	must've been a troll
2016-05-06 22:47:23	@Espyo	it was
2016-05-06 22:47:46	@PikFan	I don't think I've ever come across a person who said that they legitimately hated Pikmin
2016-05-06 22:49:03	@Espyo	same
2016-05-06 22:49:06	Marty2000	I wonder why the person wants such an edit to be removed. I don't think anybody will ever see it now....
2016-05-06 22:49:14	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 22:49:17	@Espyo	paranoia or something
2016-05-06 22:49:39	Marty2000	Well, the user asks whatever he wants, I don't criticize... but to give my opinion, it sounds strange to me
2016-05-06 22:49:42	Marty2000	NEarly stupid
2016-05-06 22:50:27	@Espyo	yep
2016-05-06 22:51:42	@PikFan	anyway, back to the Splatfest conversation
2016-05-06 22:52:05	@PikFan	since this is a global Splatfest, it'll be more like regular Turf Wars now
2016-05-06 22:52:17	@PikFan	ie. Japanese people everywhere
2016-05-06 22:52:53	Marty2000	...Just got killed with my Bubbler
2016-05-06 22:52:55	@PikFan	I don't really mind them that much anymore, but it means I'll be getting paired up with better Japanese players
2016-05-06 22:52:58	Marty2000	Thanks lag :/
2016-05-06 22:53:05	@PikFan	lol?
2016-05-06 22:53:22	@PikFan	but yeah, Splatfests have always paired me with really OP users
2016-05-06 22:53:29	Marty2000	Oh yeah, plus the Splaftest  ill begin early in Europe
2016-05-06 22:53:35	Marty2000	will*
2016-05-06 22:53:37	@PikFan	and this one will pair me with OP Japanese players
2016-05-06 22:53:40	 *	@PikFan shudders
2016-05-06 22:54:00	Marty2000	Yes, I think it's cool the Splatfest is worlwide
2016-05-06 22:54:03	@PikFan	maybe I should derank myself to A+
2016-05-06 22:54:13	@PikFan	at the same time, I worked pretty hard to get to S...
2016-05-06 22:55:04	@PikFan	Marty, you've had the game since launch, right? how long did it take for you to get to S+?
2016-05-06 22:55:36	Marty2000	Hmm
2016-05-06 22:55:39	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-06 22:55:46	Marty2000	I got S+ in October
2016-05-06 22:56:12	Marty2000	So 5 months
2016-05-06 22:56:26	@PikFan	hm
2016-05-06 22:56:37	@PikFan	well, you're just a faster learner, then
2016-05-06 22:57:04	Marty2000	Oh, no
2016-05-06 22:57:08	Marty2000	I just probably got lucky
2016-05-06 22:57:20	Marty2000	I only play in friend squads now
2016-05-06 22:57:25	Marty2000	(so I can't lose points)
2016-05-06 22:57:25	@PikFan	oh
2016-05-06 22:57:38	@PikFan	oh, you only play in private?
2016-05-06 22:57:55	Marty2000	But it's been a long time since I have played in Ranked, because my friends stopped playing the game
2016-05-06 22:58:00	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-06 22:58:06	Marty2000	And I don't really want to take the risk of losing my points
2016-05-06 22:58:19	Marty2000	It's only points, after all, that's true...
2016-05-06 22:58:23	@PikFan	well, it'll be 5 months since I got Splatoon, and I'm still in S
2016-05-06 22:58:23	Marty2000	But I want to keep them
2016-05-06 22:58:33	@PikFan	so like I said, you're a faster learner
2016-05-06 22:58:53	@PikFan	I probably won't reach S+ for a while
2016-05-06 22:58:58	@PikFan	much less S+99

2016-05-06 22:59:25	Marty2000	Sometimes I ranked down to S, ranked up to S+, then A, then S...
2016-05-06 22:59:27	@PikFan	but according to Espyo, getting to level 50 in less than 4 months is REALLY fast
2016-05-06 22:59:39	@PikFan	ouch, S+ to A? that sucks
2016-05-06 23:01:09	@Espyo	that's because it is
2016-05-06 23:01:18	@Espyo	I mean, it might not be if you do Ranked a lot
2016-05-06 23:01:19	@Espyo	which I don't
2016-05-06 23:01:21	@Espyo	but still
2016-05-06 23:01:46	@PikFan	how long does it take a person normally?
2016-05-06 23:02:04	Marty2000	I used to play a lot in Ranked, and it's very tiresome when you keep losing whereas you're giving a lot of effort
2016-05-06 23:02:13	@PikFan	yeah
2016-05-06 23:02:24	Marty2000	Don't play Ranked for hours, or you'll likely get angry when losing
2016-05-06 23:02:31	@PikFan	oh, I know
2016-05-06 23:02:33	Marty2000	Because of ranks
2016-05-06 23:02:35	@PikFan	I know all too well
2016-05-06 23:02:44	Marty2000	However, I don't mind if it's in squads
2016-05-06 23:02:47	@PikFan	that's why I don't play Ranked much
2016-05-06 23:03:26	@PikFan	Espyo: actually, I really ramped up my efforts to get to Level 50 in the last couple of weeks before I got it
2016-05-06 23:03:32	Marty2000	*curious* What weapons do you all use in Ranked? And cllothes?
2016-05-06 23:03:37	@PikFan	hell, I went from 49 to 50 in a week
2016-05-06 23:03:45	Marty2000	Good!
2016-05-06 23:04:09	@PikFan	hmm
2016-05-06 23:04:12	@PikFan	.96 Gal
2016-05-06 23:04:20	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-06 23:04:23	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-06 23:04:24	@PikFan	used to use the Custom Jet Squelcher
2016-05-06 23:04:33	@PikFan	dunno about clothes though
2016-05-06 23:04:37	@Espyo	well, I don't have any stats with me
2016-05-06 23:04:40	@Espyo	but I play once a week
2016-05-06 23:04:45	@Espyo	and it takes me like a month and a half to level up
2016-05-06 23:04:50	@Espyo	on my mid 40s
2016-05-06 23:05:08	@PikFan	you can check SplatNet
2016-05-06 23:05:30	Marty2000	If someone is looking for clothes with particular bonuses, by the way, feel free to ask, I'll check what I have
2016-05-06 23:05:40	@PikFan	bonuses?
2016-05-06 23:05:44	@PikFan	looking?
2016-05-06 23:06:01	@PikFan	oh... is it because you can buy other people's clothes?
2016-05-06 23:06:01	Marty2000	Hmm... you can buy the gear of other Inklings
2016-05-06 23:06:05	@PikFan	right, right
2016-05-06 23:06:06	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-06 23:06:20	Marty2000	And you can get their "bonuses" as well
2016-05-06 23:06:29	Marty2000	Sometimes, 1 two, and very rarely three
2016-05-06 23:06:42	Marty2000	(the three same bonuses already unlocked)
2016-05-06 23:07:03	Marty2000	I used to play with the Splattershot Jr in Ranked Battle
2016-05-06 23:07:12	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Gst5gWvYM neat
2016-05-06 23:07:25	@Espyo	I don't think I can test it though
2016-05-06 23:07:33	@Espyo	don't have any save files with uncollected treasures
2016-05-06 23:07:39	@Espyo	and I really don't feel like starting a new story slot :|
2016-05-06 23:07:55	Marty2000	Oh, it crashed ... :/
2016-05-06 23:08:01	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-06 23:08:03	Marty2000	Normally, you can collect the treasure
2016-05-06 23:08:13	Marty2000	Maybe you know the glitch from HSS already
2016-05-06 23:08:28	@Espyo	I...don't recall...
2016-05-06 23:08:33	Marty2000	So
2016-05-06 23:08:41	Marty2000	You can "collect" the treasure
2016-05-06 23:08:48	Marty2000	And if you use that technique
2016-05-06 23:08:52	Marty2000	(with geysers)
2016-05-06 23:08:58	Marty2000	(or caves)
2016-05-06 23:09:05	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Pikmin 2.5/Caves by Drigibug313 (+780 N Created page with "{{P2.5}} {{Construction}}  This is a walkthrough of sorts for...) http://www.pikminfanon.com/?curid=10537&diff=52923
2016-05-06 23:09:11	Marty2000	On the area selection screen, the number of Pokos will add up
2016-05-06 23:09:22	Marty2000	But nothing will happen on the save selection screen
2016-05-06 23:09:45	Marty2000	(the number of Pokos will still show 280 if you do that for all treasures, because yo can't reproduce this glitch for the first treasure)
2016-05-06 23:09:46	@PikFan	"I wouldn't be sure on that. Don't forget Costume also means Cosplay and Cosplay is very popular in Japan."
2016-05-06 23:09:52	@PikFan	oh yeah
2016-05-06 23:09:54	@PikFan	that's so true...
2016-05-06 23:09:56	Marty2000	Wait, I'll try to find it
2016-05-06 23:09:59	@PikFan	dammit Nintendo
2016-05-06 23:10:15	@PikFan	can we have a normal regional Splatfest again
2016-05-06 23:10:42	@PikFan	50/50 chance of winning or losing Splatfests
2016-05-06 23:10:53	@PikFan	and so far, I've lost 3 Splatfests, and won 1
2016-05-06 23:11:18	@PikFan	urk
2016-05-06 23:11:23	@PikFan	well, I'll wait and see
2016-05-06 23:11:41	@PikFan	anyway, who thinks Nintendo should do something special for Splatoon's birthday?
2016-05-06 23:11:54	@PikFan	they should come out with a big update
2016-05-06 23:12:03	@Espyo	hm, that glitch is confusing me then
2016-05-06 23:12:11	@Espyo	they should, but won't
2016-05-06 23:12:14	@Espyo	I want Octolings :(
2016-05-06 23:12:30	@PikFan	I do too
2016-05-06 23:12:39	Marty2000	So do I :/
2016-05-06 23:13:00	@PikFan	but yeah, you're right, Nintendo won't, because Nintendo is never in touch with their fans and the gaming industry
2016-05-06 23:13:01	@PikFan	OH
2016-05-06 23:13:02	@PikFan	OH YEAH
2016-05-06 23:13:09	@PikFan	I NEVER RANTED ABOUT NX
2016-05-06 23:13:11	@PikFan	okay so
2016-05-06 23:13:30	@PikFan	I think it's really, really, REALLY stupid that they're not showing the NX at E3
2016-05-06 23:13:49	@PikFan	like... stupid to the power of dumb

2016-05-06 23:14:18	@Espyo	btw, I can reproduce the glitch on the video I linked
2016-05-06 23:14:20	@Espyo	and it does crash the game
2016-05-06 23:14:27	@PikFan	and while I'm very hyped for Zelda, I really hope they talk about other games, too
2016-05-06 23:14:36	@PikFan	*cough*P4*cough*
2016-05-06 23:14:45	@Espyo	who knows what's going on on Nintendo's heads
2016-05-06 23:14:47	@PikFan	I know they won't, knowing Nintendo's backward-ass ways
2016-05-06 23:14:53	@PikFan	but I can still hope
2016-05-06 23:15:14	Marty2000	There will be a Treehouse instead of a digital event this year
2016-05-06 23:15:16	@PikFan	also, March 2017 seems like a strange time to launch
2016-05-06 23:15:16	Marty2000	:/
2016-05-06 23:15:33	@PikFan	I was correct that they'd be launching in 2017, but... I thought Holiday 2017
2016-05-06 23:15:34	Marty2000	With Zelda in the Treehouse
2016-05-06 23:15:37	@PikFan	not March
2016-05-06 23:15:43	@Espyo	ok, so what you're saying Marty, is that you can collect the treasure and escape through a geyser in the same frame
2016-05-06 23:15:43	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2016-05-06 23:15:55	@Espyo	and it tallies up the price of the treasure, without actually removing the treasure from the cave?
2016-05-06 23:16:18	Marty2000	No, the treasure is removed
2016-05-06 23:16:32	Marty2000	Wait, I'm looking for the video
2016-05-06 23:16:36	@PikFan	but anyway, I cannot express how utterly idiotic it is that they won't talk about the NX at E3
2016-05-06 23:16:39	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-06 23:16:40	Marty2000	I could reproduce this glitch on the WIi version too
2016-05-06 23:16:54	@PikFan	that's as bad as not showing Zelda at E3 last year
2016-05-06 23:16:55	@PikFan	if not worse
2016-05-06 23:17:04	@PikFan	way to kill the hype, Nintendo
2016-05-06 23:17:41	@PikFan	there is no way to justify any of their decisions anymore
2016-05-06 23:18:25	@PikFan	Nintendo is just making really, really poor choices
2016-05-06 23:18:34	@PikFan	also, I heard the scathing reviews about Star Fox Zero
2016-05-06 23:18:55	@PikFan	and what does Nintendo do? nothing
2016-05-06 23:19:24	@PikFan	they can't even be bothered to make a patch that disables Zero's motion controls and stuff
2016-05-06 23:20:11	@PikFan	I thought Kimishima might be a good president
2016-05-06 23:20:24	@PikFan	and who knows, maybe he will be, he's just waiting for the right time to strike
2016-05-06 23:20:40	@PikFan	but... I'm seriously questioning their choices
2016-05-06 23:20:52	@PikFan	then again, I'm ALWAYS seriously questioning their choices
2016-05-06 23:21:50	Marty2000	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEIpQyvJgfc
2016-05-06 23:22:00	Marty2000	Look
2016-05-06 23:22:06	Marty2000	The first treasure = 280 pokos
2016-05-06 23:22:17	Marty2000	If you reproduce this glitch with other treasures (except the first)
2016-05-06 23:22:37	Marty2000	It will still show 280 pokos earned so far
2016-05-06 23:22:52	@PikFan	rant over
2016-05-06 23:22:53	@PikFan	anyway
2016-05-06 23:22:57	@PikFan	how did you guys find this?
2016-05-06 23:23:39	Marty2000	I think you're right
2016-05-06 23:23:59	@Espyo	woah that's a long video
2016-05-06 23:24:04	@Espyo	I remember seeing it, but not how it was like
2016-05-06 23:24:11	@Espyo	and your explanation isn't really making much sense to me... sorry
2016-05-06 23:24:17	@Espyo	either I'm tired, or you're not explaining it well enough
2016-05-06 23:24:28	Marty2000	No, I'm probably not explaning well
2016-05-06 23:24:39	Marty2000	I have difficulties explaining those things correctly...
2016-05-06 23:27:23	@PikFan	sorry, gotta go

2016-05-07 13:38:43	@Espyo	holy HELL that Fiery Blowhog video
2016-05-07 13:38:51	@Espyo	the Yellow Pikmin went a LOT higher than I expected it to
2016-05-07 13:41:21	Marty2000	Yes, it goes even higher
2016-05-07 13:41:34	Marty2000	But I forgot to mention that it works for Rocks, Reds, Blues as well
2016-05-07 13:41:40	Marty2000	(they go less high, though)
2016-05-07 13:41:54	Marty2000	Winged Pikmin aren't affected
2016-05-07 13:42:00	Marty2000	I don't know for Purples
2016-05-07 13:42:13	Marty2000	I'll have to try in Beastly Cavern
2016-05-07 13:42:25	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 13:42:54	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging Right now I'm trying to know how much faster Yellows are

2016-05-07 13:48:28	@Espyo	ah, that will be nice to know
2016-05-07 13:48:44	Marty2000	Even more nice to know Whites are slower
2016-05-07 13:48:49	Marty2000	Or not :/
2016-05-07 13:48:57	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-07 13:49:09	Marty2000	I have "precise "values
2016-05-07 13:49:22	Marty2000	I'll try with Purples and Reds to check something
2016-05-07 13:49:38	Marty2000	I'll post here
2016-05-07 13:52:27	Marty2000	I should precise that I always use the same fruit for my tests, and I reset when the Pikmin has finished digging up
2016-05-07 13:52:40	Marty2000	Anyway, it's going to be interesting
2016-05-07 13:52:52	Marty2000	I've almost finished
2016-05-07 13:54:14	Marty2000	Ok so
2016-05-07 13:54:32	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 13:54:51	Marty2000	==Time it takes for a Pikmin to dig up a Cupid's Grenade==
2016-05-07 13:55:06	Marty2000	Blue Pikmin =  2 min 58 sec
2016-05-07 13:55:18	Marty2000	Yellow Pikmin = 1 min 29 sec
2016-05-07 13:55:29	Marty2000	White Pikmin = 5 min 56 sec
2016-05-07 13:55:40	Marty2000	Purple Pikmin = 1 min 59 sec
2016-05-07 13:55:51	Marty2000	I need to test with Red and Winged Pikmin
2016-05-07 13:56:24	Marty2000	But I guess it's the same for Reds and Purples, and for White and Winged Pikmin
2016-05-07 14:07:21	Marty2000	So we can conclude that the time taken for a Pikmin to dig up an object (in Pikmin 3 only) :
2016-05-07 14:07:36	Marty2000	depends on its power 
2016-05-07 14:08:37	Marty2000	except for Yellow Pikmin
2016-05-07 14:09:01	Marty2000	(because they have a faster animation)

2016-05-07 14:14:20	Marty2000	Sorry I had problems with the chatroom
2016-05-07 14:17:03	@Espyo	that is so weird...
2016-05-07 14:17:22	@Espyo	I would never imagine the times to be THAT far apart
2016-05-07 14:17:33	@Espyo	hm, I guess that would also explain some of my Silver Lake Remix woes
2016-05-07 14:17:58	@Espyo	"I don't have much time left... I'll leave this one White Pikmin to dig up the Cupid's Grenade. It'll be fast, since it digs at normal speed, but then carries it super quick!"
2016-05-07 14:18:09	@Espyo	and then the 10 seconds were ticking, and the Pikmin was still digging it up :|
2016-05-07 14:18:33	Marty2000	:/ Well, it's interesting, I don't think it works like that in Pikmin 2
2016-05-07 14:18:39	Marty2000	I'll check too
2016-05-07 14:19:11	Marty2000	Well, I'll probably need to restart a save, though...
2016-05-07 14:20:43	Marty2000	To sum up, it's better to leave a Purple Pikmin idg up and carry the fruit rather than leaving a White...
2016-05-07 14:20:47	Marty2000	dig*
2016-05-07 14:22:18	@Espyo	there's buried treasure in Challenge Mode
2016-05-07 14:22:31	Marty2000	Oh, right
2016-05-07 14:22:34	Marty2000	Thanks
2016-05-07 14:22:36	@Espyo	but yeah, that conclusion is mind-blowing
2016-05-07 14:23:39	Marty2000	Yellows are twice as fast as Blues, and four times as fast as Whites...
2016-05-07 14:23:44	Marty2000	It's based on their power
2016-05-07 14:23:56	Marty2000	(except for Yellows, once again)
2016-05-07 14:24:04	Marty2000	I don' tthink it will change something in  P2 
2016-05-07 14:24:12	Marty2000	But I'm going to check again
2016-05-07 14:24:45	Marty2000	Dweevil Nest seems to be a good cave for my test
2016-05-07 14:24:49	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 14:24:51	@Espyo	come to think of it
2016-05-07 14:24:57	Marty2000	Even though there is no Bulbmin... :/
2016-05-07 14:24:58	@Espyo	the game files might have a parameter for the digging speed
2016-05-07 14:25:14	@Espyo	I'll check in a bit
2016-05-07 14:25:26	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 14:25:41	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-07 14:25:51	@Espyo	Louie's internal name in P3 is sometimes Player_D, other times Luzy
2016-05-07 14:26:06	Marty2000	Uh
2016-05-07 14:26:09	Marty2000	It changes?
2016-05-07 14:26:16	Marty2000	Strange...
2016-05-07 14:26:27	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-07 14:28:11	@Espyo	weird
2016-05-07 14:28:19	@Espyo	I could swear P3 had parameters for every type
2016-05-07 14:28:21	@Espyo	but I can't find it
2016-05-07 14:28:26	@Espyo	I can find general parameters, though
2016-05-07 14:28:46	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 14:33:17	@Espyo	oh, I found SOMETHING
2016-05-07 14:33:27	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-07 14:33:30	@Espyo	Purples have 15 attack, throw height of 60
2016-05-07 14:33:39	@Espyo	Blues attack for 10, throw at 72.5
2016-05-07 14:33:47	Marty2000	Great
2016-05-07 14:33:49	@Espyo	Winged attack for 5, throw is 72.5
2016-05-07 14:33:59	@Espyo	Alph has 5 attack, 30 throw height
2016-05-07 14:34:11	@Espyo	same for all leaders
2016-05-07 14:34:19	@Espyo	Reds attack for 15, throw is normal at 72.5
2016-05-07 14:34:27	@Espyo	Rocks attack for 20, throw is the same
2016-05-07 14:34:32	@Espyo	Whites for 5, throw is the same
2016-05-07 14:34:39	@Espyo	Yellows for 10, throw is 107
2016-05-07 14:34:41	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-07 14:34:49	@Espyo	I need to put this on the wiki
2016-05-07 14:35:04	@Espyo	but unfortunately, no other parameters, like movement speed or digging speed
2016-05-07 14:35:06	@Espyo	at least not yet

2016-05-07 14:35:19	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 14:35:22	Marty2000	Pikmin 2 
2016-05-07 14:35:26	Marty2000	===Time taken for a Pikmin to dig up the Paradoxical Enigma===
2016-05-07 14:35:38	Marty2000	Red = 3 min 9 sec
2016-05-07 14:35:42	Marty2000	White = 4 min 43 sec
2016-05-07 14:35:43	Marty2000	...
2016-05-07 14:36:14	Marty2000	There is no Purple in the cave
2016-05-07 14:36:22	Marty2000	But I guess they can dig up even faster
2016-05-07 14:39:27	Marty2000	It's really surprising...
2016-05-07 14:40:05	@Espyo	how can you say Purples dig faster if there are none?
2016-05-07 14:40:21	@Espyo	hm, I think it's best if I try it here
2016-05-07 14:40:27	@Espyo	since I can edit caves to have any starting Pikmin amount I want
2016-05-07 14:40:52	Marty2000	I say so because it seem related to their power
2016-05-07 14:41:00	Marty2000	And Purples are more powerful than Reds in P2
2016-05-07 14:41:09	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 14:41:33	Marty2000	Purples are as powerful as Reds in P3, though
2016-05-07 14:41:39	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-07 14:41:46	@Espyo	hm, there are some parameters here for "itemprogressparam"
2016-05-07 14:41:55	@Espyo	that has a "start progress" value for all fruits
2016-05-07 14:41:58	@Espyo	can't really find a pattern
2016-05-07 14:42:09	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-07 14:42:18	@Espyo	looks like I found what controls how many days enemies take to respawn
2016-05-07 14:42:23	@Espyo	but I'm not sure
2016-05-07 14:42:33	@Espyo	I mean, sure, it says here it's the "rebirth_interval"
2016-05-07 14:42:35	@Espyo	that's pretty self-explanatory
2016-05-07 14:42:40	@Espyo	but this could be unused
2016-05-07 14:42:53	@Espyo	and in an area, each enemy instance also specifies its own rebirth interval
2016-05-07 14:42:54	@Espyo	so...
2016-05-07 14:43:00	Marty2000	Interesting...
2016-05-07 14:43:18	@Espyo	hm, it might be wrong
2016-05-07 14:43:22	@Espyo	says here Dwarf Red Bulborbs take 3 days
2016-05-07 14:43:24	@Espyo	is that right?
2016-05-07 14:43:29	Marty2000	Yes it's right
2016-05-07 14:43:30	@Espyo	oh, wait
2016-05-07 14:43:34	@Espyo	the Emperor Bulblax is here!
2016-05-07 14:43:35	@Espyo	with 0 days
2016-05-07 14:43:40	@Espyo	oh, I have to pay attention to this list
2016-05-07 14:43:46	@Espyo	it could contain names of OTHER unused enemies
2016-05-07 14:44:04	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-07 14:44:06	Marty2000	Good!
2016-05-07 14:45:22	@Espyo	!
2016-05-07 14:45:25	@Espyo	"GasHiba"
2016-05-07 14:45:32	@Espyo	this is what the gas pipes are called in P2
2016-05-07 14:45:57	Marty2000	Oh!
2016-05-07 14:46:03	@Espyo	there's a Iwakko_Crystal, which is likely the Skutterchuck's crystal nodules
2016-05-07 14:46:10	@Espyo	but nothing else in the game considers the crystals as being special...
2016-05-07 14:46:12	Marty2000	I guess it would be interesting to add it on the wiki
2016-05-07 14:46:18	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-07 14:46:35	Marty2000	So they were to return in P3 at some point...
2016-05-07 14:46:40	Marty2000	Too bad they got removed :/
2016-05-07 14:47:24	@Espyo	"MureBuka"?
2016-05-07 14:47:30	@Espyo	something related to the Scornets (Mure)
2016-05-07 14:47:57	@Espyo	Buka means subordinate...
2016-05-07 14:48:12	@Espyo	so maybe the Scornets themselves, but there is a parameter for the Mure, and one for the MureBoss
2016-05-07 14:48:14	@Espyo	so...
2016-05-07 14:48:18	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Scornet#Technical_information
2016-05-07 14:48:26	Marty2000	Internal name	mure
2016-05-07 14:48:44	@Espyo	yeah, but the thing is, different parts of the files call the same enemy different names
2016-05-07 14:48:46	@Espyo	well, sometimes
2016-05-07 14:48:55	@Espyo	the name I chose to put there reflects the most common none
2016-05-07 14:48:56	@Espyo	*one
2016-05-07 14:49:02	@Espyo	at least as far as can be noticed
2016-05-07 14:49:18	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-07 14:49:37	@Espyo	...Tamagumo?
2016-05-07 14:49:43	@Espyo	like Damagumo, the Beady Long Legs?
2016-05-07 14:49:57	@Espyo	but it already does have an entry for the Damagumo
2016-05-07 14:49:59	@Espyo	maybe a typo?
2016-05-07 14:50:08	Marty2000	Hmm...
2016-05-07 14:50:21	Marty2000	Nothing about Tamagumo on Pikipedia
2016-05-07 14:50:31	Marty2000	Either a mistake or another enmy?
2016-05-07 14:50:34	Marty2000	enemy?
2016-05-07 14:50:54	@Espyo	it's related to the way they Romanize the name
2016-05-07 14:51:08	@Espyo	"Tama" is a valid way of romanizing the word that means "ball"
2016-05-07 14:51:09	Marty2000	Oh yes
2016-05-07 14:51:14	@Espyo	but "dama" is... well, I guess more correct?
2016-05-07 14:51:29	@Espyo	ok, there are parameters for UjinkoA to UjinkoC, which are the Sheargrubs
2016-05-07 14:51:32	@Espyo	but it's hard to tell which is which
2016-05-07 14:51:39	@Espyo	C could be the Shearwig or the Swarming
2016-05-07 14:52:03	@Espyo	but either way, the rest of the game's files (that I know) only have UjinkoA and UjinkoB, for the Female and Male, respectively
2016-05-07 14:52:29	@Espyo	hm, parameters for a snow mushroom...
2016-05-07 14:52:47	@Espyo	and then a lot of objects... there's too many
2016-05-07 14:52:55	@Espyo	I'd have to know each one to know what's used and not
2016-05-07 14:52:57	@Espyo	and I'm not quite there yet
2016-05-07 14:53:29	@Espyo	well, the only really "new" thing in here is the gas pipe
2016-05-07 14:54:18	Marty2000	Do they have something about how much time they take to respawn or something elsE?
2016-05-07 14:54:22	Marty2000	else*
2016-05-07 14:54:32	Marty2000	(gas pipes)*
2016-05-07 14:54:55	@Espyo	oh, yes
2016-05-07 14:55:07	@Espyo	the "save_type" is 0
2016-05-07 14:55:13	@Espyo	there's not enough info to know how that works
2016-05-07 14:55:18	@Espyo	and different objects have a different number for this
2016-05-07 14:55:24	@Espyo	seems to be between 0, 1, 2, and 3
2016-05-07 14:55:30	@Espyo	but "rebirth_interval" is 1
2016-05-07 14:55:37	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 14:55:44	@Espyo	so, I guess they'd respawn every day, if they were in the game?
2016-05-07 14:56:07	Marty2000	I think so
2016-05-07 14:59:48	Marty2000	Oh, by the way, now that I think of it, is there any file about the Pikmin and their resistance (I ask because I'm interested to know something about WInged Pikmin and the fact they are resistant to certain forms of crushing)
2016-05-07 15:00:02	Marty2000	in knwoing*
2016-05-07 15:00:06	Marty2000	knowing*
2016-05-07 15:00:21	@Espyo	there's nothing
2016-05-07 15:00:24	@Espyo	not that I know of, anyway
2016-05-07 15:01:04	Marty2000	Ok, thanks.
2016-05-07 15:01:48	Marty2000	Anyway... we'll have to modify this http://www.pikminwiki.com/Digging
2016-05-07 15:02:13	Marty2000	+ "Check if the Geographic Projection counts as an always semi-buried treasure."
2016-05-07 15:02:23	Marty2000	It is semi-buried when found
2016-05-07 15:03:48	@Espyo	that might be asking to check from the game's files
2016-05-07 15:03:49	@Espyo	maybe
2016-05-07 15:04:27	Marty2000	Maybe
2016-05-07 15:04:45	Marty2000	But it has the properties other semi-buried treasures have :
2016-05-07 15:04:47	Marty2000	Example :
2016-05-07 15:05:00	Marty2000	They return to their original location (semi-buried) when the day ends
2016-05-07 15:05:19	Marty2000	Which the non-buried treasures do not have

2016-05-07 15:08:44	@Espyo	hmm

2016-05-07 15:10:51	Chiaki_Nanami	how is life
2016-05-07 15:11:08	Marty2000	Life is good, thanks. What about yours?
2016-05-07 15:11:20	Chiaki_Nanami	i just came home from a walk
2016-05-07 15:11:28	Chiaki_Nanami	i'm exhausted

2016-05-07 15:13:05	Chiaki_Nanami	i like testyo's functionality
2016-05-07 15:13:06	Testyo	is there a place to download https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/KopPad%20theme.png
2016-05-07 15:13:22	Chiaki_Nanami	that's a good question
2016-05-07 15:13:33	Marty2000	Oh yes, Testyo's great
2016-05-07 15:13:33	Testyo	then, we got word that some NIWA wikis will be doing a segmented?
2016-05-07 15:16:15	Marty2000	Hm... Espyo :
2016-05-07 15:16:26	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Unused_content_in_Pikmin_3#Unused_enemy_parameters
2016-05-07 15:16:35	Marty2000	"Instead of having its HP set to 1, like most other enemies that deal damage in a special way, the Nectarous Dandelfly has its HP value set to 15."
2016-05-07 15:17:01	Marty2000	It's not really unused, since Winged Pikmin have to hit the creature three times if they are not directly thrown...
2016-05-07 15:17:19	Marty2000	Of course there is no health wheel
2016-05-07 15:17:25	Marty2000	But I don't think it's unused
2016-05-07 15:17:29	@Espyo	oh yeah
2016-05-07 15:18:10	@Espyo	fixed

2016-05-07 15:27:35	Marty2000	Hi!
2016-05-07 15:28:09	@Espyo	hi
2016-05-07 15:33:31	Bulborbs_At_View	How goes it?
2016-05-07 15:35:29	@Espyo	all good
2016-05-07 15:35:30	@Espyo	you?
2016-05-07 15:42:22	Marty2000	Fine, thanks. What about you?

2016-05-07 15:44:25	@Espyo	wow that is so wasteful
2016-05-07 15:44:53	Marty2000	Maybe, but she could jump so fast
2016-05-07 15:45:01	Marty2000	Maybe less than 2 seconds
2016-05-07 15:45:06	Marty2000	It was funny, though
2016-05-07 15:45:53	Marty2000	However, I prefer to use various abilities instead of focusing on one in particular
2016-05-07 15:49:18	@Espyo	well, I got equipment that had respawn speed up as the main ability
2016-05-07 15:49:21	@Espyo	and it's a game changer
2016-05-07 15:49:28	@Espyo	dying no longer feels like hellish torture
2016-05-07 15:50:28	Marty2000	Ah, you like Quick Respawn abilties too? They're great

2016-05-07 15:52:49	@Espyo	I miss not having Stealth Jump though :/
2016-05-07 15:54:44	Marty2000	I use Stealth Jump with my Splattershot Jr
2016-05-07 15:55:12	Marty2000	It's great too... I think there is a possibility to have a Stealth Jump with many sub Quick Respawns

2016-05-07 15:56:00	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-07 15:57:38	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-07 15:57:45	@Espyo	I've been thinking we should try to get the juice color
2016-05-07 15:57:46	@Espyo	no need :|
2016-05-07 15:57:53	@Espyo	it's right here in the game's files
2016-05-07 15:58:10	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-07 15:59:45	@Espyo	there's a "grade" parameter, but it's always 1
2016-05-07 15:59:54	@Espyo	never mind
2016-05-07 15:59:56	@Espyo	there's a 4 here
2016-05-07 16:00:57	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-07 16:01:02	Marty2000	Makes sense
2016-05-07 16:01:10	@Espyo	does it?
2016-05-07 16:01:21	Marty2000	When you retrive a fruit
2016-05-07 16:01:25	Marty2000	retrieve*
2016-05-07 16:01:46	Marty2000	The juice fills the bottle in quarters
2016-05-07 16:01:54	Marty2000	There is a fruit that only fills a quarter, for example
2016-05-07 16:02:05	Marty2000	(the little part of the watermelon)
2016-05-07 16:02:27	@Espyo	doesn't quite look like that's related to the "grade" at all
2016-05-07 16:03:07	@Espyo	Sunseed Berry is 2, all Crimson Banquet pieces are 5, the starfruit's pieces are 4...
2016-05-07 16:03:33	Marty2000	well... I don't know then
2016-05-07 16:45:28	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 16:45:40	@Espyo	this parameter, like others, has a Japanese comment
2016-05-07 16:45:45	@Espyo	but the comment is サイズ
2016-05-07 16:45:46	Marty2000	Have you found something?
2016-05-07 16:45:48	@Espyo	which translates to size
2016-05-07 16:45:59	@Espyo	so the parameter itself is called "grade", but the comment says "size"...
2016-05-07 16:46:02	Marty2000	Ah...
2016-05-07 16:46:09	@Espyo	it's not a multiplier to the size
2016-05-07 16:46:13	@Espyo	because multipliers should be floats
2016-05-07 16:46:15	@Espyo	and this is an integer
2016-05-07 16:46:32	@Espyo	...in other words, this number cannot change the size of the fruit in-game compared to its model, or anything like that
2016-05-07 16:46:43	@Espyo	oh, maybe...
2016-05-07 16:46:47	@Espyo	it's used for route detection
2016-05-07 16:46:59	@Espyo	Pikmin can probably carry a Juicy Gaggle through a tunnel
2016-05-07 16:47:04	@Espyo	but not a half Crimson Banquet
2016-05-07 16:47:13	@Espyo	Insect Condo is 4
2016-05-07 16:47:17	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-07 16:47:36	@Espyo	Searing Acidshock is 2
2016-05-07 16:47:50	@Espyo	Scaly Custard is 3
2016-05-07 16:47:58	@Espyo	Slapstick Crescent is 5
2016-05-07 16:48:05	@Espyo	ah, see, Cupid's Grenade is 1
2016-05-07 16:48:10	@Espyo	let me find other "1"s
2016-05-07 16:48:25	Marty2000	Well, that's likely it
2016-05-07 16:48:27	@Espyo	when I said earlier that most of them had this value set to 1, I was actually looking at the non-fruit carriables
2016-05-07 16:48:34	@Espyo	so the upgrades, Louie in Mission Mode, etc.
2016-05-07 16:48:50	@Espyo	Golden Grenade is also 1
2016-05-07 16:48:58	@Espyo	a single grape is 1
2016-05-07 16:49:38	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-07 16:49:41	@Espyo	there goes the theory
2016-05-07 16:49:44	@Espyo	Fire-Breathing Feast is 1
2016-05-07 16:49:48	Marty2000	That's interesting anyway. It surprising, however, tat the upgrades are set to 1
2016-05-07 16:49:56	@Espyo	Juicy Gaggle is 1
2016-05-07 16:49:58	Marty2000	that*
2016-05-07 16:50:04	@Espyo	yeah, the upgrades being set to 1 is also weird
2016-05-07 16:50:25	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 16:50:33	@Espyo	besides the Fire-Breathing Feast, it makes sense
2016-05-07 16:50:39	@Espyo	so I'm wondering if this is a mistake
2016-05-07 16:50:43	@Espyo	maybe they fixed it in an update
2016-05-07 16:50:44	@Espyo	lemme check
2016-05-07 16:52:45	@Espyo	nope... it never got fixed
2016-05-07 16:52:55	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 16:53:07	@Espyo	let me check the path system; if there's something related to "grade", then it adds up
2016-05-07 16:53:18	@Espyo	maybe it doesn't make a difference for the Fire-Breathing Feast
2016-05-07 16:53:22	Marty2000	Strange...
2016-05-07 16:53:29	@Espyo	since there's only one path back to the Onion
2016-05-07 16:53:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 16:53:40	@Espyo	so that could either say 1 or 5, and it wouldn't interfere with the Pikmin's path
2016-05-07 16:53:56	Marty2000	There is no obstacle on the way, though
2016-05-07 16:55:03	@Espyo	yeah, I just checked the map, there's only one possible path
2016-05-07 16:56:22	Marty2000	For the Crimson Banquet, there are several possible paths
2016-05-07 16:56:51	Marty2000	Its value is 5, isn't it?
2016-05-07 16:57:22	Marty2000	Oh wait, each possible path for the Crimson Banquet  doesn't have any little obstacle, so it's useless too
2016-05-07 16:57:33	@Espyo	yeah...
2016-05-07 16:57:40	@Espyo	maybe Mission Mode, though
2016-05-07 16:57:47	@Espyo	Thirsty Desert Remix has it, I know that
2016-05-07 16:57:52	@Espyo	but I think there's only one path, too
2016-05-07 16:58:03	Marty2000	Only one path, yeah
2016-05-07 16:58:17	Marty2000	(besides the one Winged Pikmin use)
2016-05-07 16:58:59	Marty2000	If I remember, Winged Pikmin use a different path
2016-05-07 16:59:07	Marty2000	Wait, I'll try with each piece
2016-05-07 16:59:13	Marty2000	Maybe the big one has a different path
2016-05-07 16:59:18	@Espyo	hmm... the closest thing the paths have is a "type" parameter
2016-05-07 16:59:20	@Espyo	nothing about size
2016-05-07 16:59:25	@Espyo	but either way, I'm adding it to the wiki
2016-05-07 16:59:37	@Espyo	hm, yeah, Winged Pikmin...
2016-05-07 16:59:40	@Espyo	they just confuse this mess further

2016-05-07 17:03:01	@Espyo	that fucking anonymous user keeps posting nonsense stuff about the NX and Pikmin 4 on E3 2016
2016-05-07 17:03:10	@Espyo	if he's some insider at Nintendo that's trying to leak

2016-05-07 17:03:24	Marty2000	lol
2016-05-07 17:03:46	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 17:03:52	@Espyo	I'll try to figure out where this IP is coming from
2016-05-07 17:03:54	@Espyo	maybe it's from Japan
2016-05-07 17:03:57	@Espyo	that would actually be scary
2016-05-07 17:05:40	@Espyo	United States
2016-05-07 17:05:40	@Espyo	yawn
2016-05-07 17:06:24	@Espyo	either this site is glitched
2016-05-07 17:06:29	@Espyo	or all 3 posts are from the same place
2016-05-07 17:06:32	Marty2000	Well, when Winged Pikmin carry a piece of the Crimson Banquet
2016-05-07 17:06:33	@Espyo	guess it's the same user
2016-05-07 17:06:35	@Espyo	good grief
2016-05-07 17:06:35	Marty2000	They take the same path
2016-05-07 17:06:39	Marty2000	No matter the size of the piece
2016-05-07 17:06:40	@Espyo	they do? hmm...
2016-05-07 17:06:48	@Espyo	yeah, all pieces have the size "5", so
2016-05-07 17:07:23	Marty2000	What fruits should I test?
2016-05-07 17:07:32	Marty2000	Oh, by the way
2016-05-07 17:07:37	@Espyo	eh, I don't think you should worry too much about it
2016-05-07 17:07:44	@Espyo	it's really hard to come up with any conclusion
2016-05-07 17:07:44	Marty2000	Isn't there a file that sets the "weight" of each fruit?
2016-05-07 17:07:46	Marty2000	For example
2016-05-07 17:07:50	Marty2000	In the Beastly Cavern
2016-05-07 17:08:03	Marty2000	You can see that the Sunseed Berry is 15 units
2016-05-07 17:08:03	@Espyo	it's hard to look at a fruit, and be like "this 'size' number doesn't sound right, we should test it"
2016-05-07 17:08:15	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 17:08:37	@Espyo	 15 weight instead of 3?
2016-05-07 17:08:37	@Espyo	what
2016-05-07 17:08:53	@Espyo	but... yeah, looks like every time you spawn an object in Pikmin 3, you can give it specific properties
2016-05-07 17:08:57	Marty2000	Well, it requires 3 Pikmin to carry, but on seesaw block, it is 15
2016-05-07 17:09:02	@Espyo	that's why some enemies have a different HP
2016-05-07 17:09:08	@Espyo	oh, I see
2016-05-07 17:09:12	Marty2000	I'll post a screenshot, wait
2016-05-07 17:09:15	@Espyo	okay
2016-05-07 17:09:20	@Espyo	although you don't need to
2016-05-07 17:09:22	@Espyo	I get what you mean
2016-05-07 17:09:27	@Espyo	unless you want to put it on the wiki or something
2016-05-07 17:12:36	Marty2000	Oh no, just to show how it looks like
2016-05-07 17:12:39	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/18/1462637540-seesaw.png
2016-05-07 17:12:45	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 17:13:06	@Espyo	okay, so I guess the game has a parameter for the fruit's WEIGHT
2016-05-07 17:13:15	@Espyo	and one for the Pikmin STRENGTH necessary to carry it
2016-05-07 17:13:24	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-07 17:13:32	@Espyo	let's see here...
2016-05-07 17:14:27	@Espyo	there's this nMass, with the value 30
2016-05-07 17:14:39	@Espyo	but nothing with the value 15 exactly
2016-05-07 17:14:44	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-07 17:14:48	@Espyo	oh, can you test something?
2016-05-07 17:14:54	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 17:14:55	@Espyo	can you collect the uh...
2016-05-07 17:15:02	@Espyo	the fruit that's on the seesaw puzzle on the Garden of Hope
2016-05-07 17:15:05	@Espyo	can't remember the name
2016-05-07 17:15:13	@Espyo	on the 2D section
2016-05-07 17:15:27	@Espyo	there are two fruits there, I'm talking about the one closer to the exit
2016-05-07 17:15:28	Marty2000	The lemon or the yellow fruit?
2016-05-07 17:15:33	@Espyo	the lemon
2016-05-07 17:15:35	Marty2000	(lemon=green)
2016-05-07 17:15:37	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 17:15:37	@Espyo	(isn't it a lime?)
2016-05-07 17:15:45	Marty2000	Lime, maybe
2016-05-07 17:15:49	@Espyo	when the Pikmin retrieve that one, do they go on top of the seesaw blocks?
2016-05-07 17:15:57	@Espyo	if so, it should change the weight number on the seesaw block too
2016-05-07 17:16:00	Marty2000	I don't think so
2016-05-07 17:16:04	@Espyo	hmm
2016-05-07 17:16:08	Marty2000	I'll check
2016-05-07 17:16:12	@Espyo	are there any other fruits that can go on top of a seesaw block?
2016-05-07 17:16:16	Marty2000	But I'll only be able to check with Reds or Rocks
2016-05-07 17:16:20	@Espyo	if so, I can compare with the nMass parameter
2016-05-07 17:16:23	@Espyo	and we'd know for sure
2016-05-07 17:16:29	@Espyo	it should be fine
2016-05-07 17:16:33	@Espyo	they all weigh 1
2016-05-07 17:17:24	@Espyo	hm, it might not be this nMass parameter after all..
2016-05-07 17:17:30	@Espyo	since Pikmin have this set to 10
2016-05-07 17:18:04	Marty2000	They don't go atop the elevator platforms... :/
2016-05-07 17:18:15	@Espyo	hm
2016-05-07 17:18:21	@Espyo	are there any other seesaw blocks?
2016-05-07 17:18:27	@Espyo	I mean
2016-05-07 17:18:33	@Espyo	seesaw blocks that can get fruit on top of them
2016-05-07 17:18:43	Marty2000	In the Tropical Wilds, there are similar ones, but they don't take into account fruits
2016-05-07 17:18:45	@Espyo	maybe the large yellow fruit on the same 2D room?
2016-05-07 17:18:49	@Espyo	they don't?
2016-05-07 17:18:51	@Espyo	that's... weigt
2016-05-07 17:18:53	@Espyo	*weird
2016-05-07 17:20:02	Marty2000	I'll try to check for the yellow fruit
2016-05-07 17:20:12	Marty2000	Once again, I think they d'ont, though
2016-05-07 17:20:17	Marty2000	don't*
2016-05-07 17:24:00	Marty2000	(try to get them on top of the elevator platforms)
2016-05-07 17:24:04	Marty2000	trying*
2016-05-07 17:24:42	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Marty/Decoration#Hex_nuts_and_flat_washers Just discovered hex nuts are in Pikmin 3. Still trying...
2016-05-07 17:25:05	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-07 17:25:34	Marty2000	Well, it's impossible :/
2016-05-07 17:26:10	@Espyo	drat
2016-05-07 17:28:51	Marty2000	Wait, I can try something in the Tropical Wilds
2016-05-07 17:29:04	Marty2000	You can move cherries with leaders thanks to the "dodge" move
2016-05-07 17:29:40	Marty2000	I'll try to get one on top of the leevator platforms of the area...
2016-05-07 17:29:46	Marty2000	But normally, it shouldn't work
2016-05-07 17:29:51	Marty2000	But I want to try
2016-05-07 17:30:40	@Espyo	huh?
2016-05-07 17:30:41	@Espyo	dodge move?
2016-05-07 17:31:24	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Dodge If you use it against Cupid's Grenades, the latter will move a little
2016-05-07 17:32:35	@Espyo	oh, I didn't know that
2016-05-07 17:32:50	@Espyo	well, that needs to be added to the wiki
2016-05-07 17:32:54	@Espyo	it has to be very useful in some cases
2016-05-07 17:32:56	Marty2000	And in  water, Charlie can move them without even using the move
2016-05-07 17:33:08	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-07 17:33:10	Marty2000	(but only Charlie in that case)
2016-05-07 17:33:24	Marty2000	Wait, I must have a video like that that I need to upload
2016-05-07 17:33:46	Marty2000	Yes I do
2016-05-07 17:33:52	Marty2000	have a video like that
2016-05-07 17:33:56	Marty2000	I'm going to upload it
2016-05-07 17:33:59	Marty2000	Might be useful
2016-05-07 17:34:19	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-07 17:34:51	Marty2000	Well, it's quite long to move it with the dodge, though

2016-05-07 17:57:47	Marty2000	The problem is...
2016-05-07 17:58:06	Marty2000	In my save, I dug ou the pellets before retrieving the Dodge
2016-05-07 17:58:17	Marty2000	So... I can't try unless I mkae a new save :/

2016-05-07 18:00:04	@Espyo	oh...
2016-05-07 18:00:15	@Espyo	but either way, I don't have the object data for the pellets, I don't think
2016-05-07 18:00:16	Marty2000	I'll check my others saves
2016-05-07 18:00:18	@Espyo	so I couldn't even compare parameters
2016-05-07 18:01:48	Marty2000	I still want to know if the pellet has a weight, though
2016-05-07 18:02:35	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-07 18:02:37	Marty2000	It's a 1 Pellet, so normally, I could move it
2016-05-07 18:02:47	@Espyo	like the Grenades?
2016-05-07 18:02:55	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 18:03:01	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 18:03:12	Marty2000	Everything with a weight of 1 can be moved using the Dodge, normally

2016-05-07 18:59:35	Marty2000	Want me to wear them next time we play? So you can buy
2016-05-07 18:59:45	@Espyo	oh, that'd actually be excellent
2016-05-07 18:59:49	@Espyo	I never bought from anybody before
2016-05-07 19:00:01	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 19:00:03	@Espyo	do I just play that person, and then approach their Inkling on the plaza?
2016-05-07 19:00:36	Marty2000	Yes, we have to play together, and once the match is finished, you have to leave, approach my character, "talk" to him and you can buy 
2016-05-07 19:00:46	Marty2000	I have to precise :
2016-05-07 19:00:57	@Espyo	ah, I see
2016-05-07 19:00:57	Marty2000	Sometimes you will get the gear with the same bonuses
2016-05-07 19:01:02	Marty2000	Sometimes with only 1 sub
2016-05-07 19:01:06	@Espyo	oh :/
2016-05-07 19:01:13	Marty2000	Sometimes with only the main
2016-05-07 19:01:16	Marty2000	But if this happens
2016-05-07 19:01:20	@Espyo	well, it's worth a shot anyway

2016-05-07 19:02:10	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 19:02:33	Marty2000	Very rarely, the cloth has the three same subs... but it costs 100 000, if I remember

2016-05-07 19:26:52	@Espyo	that in-game screenshot is really confusing me
2016-05-07 19:26:54	@Espyo	is that a texture?
2016-05-07 19:26:55	@Espyo	it's so real
2016-05-07 19:27:06	Marty2000	It is a screenshot

2016-05-07 19:27:15	@Espyo	yes, but I mean the marigolds themselves
2016-05-07 19:27:21	@Espyo	are they a texture?
2016-05-07 19:27:26	@Espyo	or a REALLY well-made model?
2016-05-07 19:27:34	Marty2000	I don't know, but it looks really real
2016-05-07 19:27:38	@Espyo	either way, and your in-game screenshot got categorized as not being part of a Pikmin game
2016-05-07 19:27:52	@Espyo	this is so bizarre...
2016-05-07 19:28:41	@Espyo	so for the real world images...
2016-05-07 19:28:45	@Espyo	you added the description
2016-05-07 19:28:51	@Espyo	then chose "real world image" on the type of file
2016-05-07 19:29:00	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 19:29:16	@Espyo	and it looks like it completely ignored you
2016-05-07 19:29:21	Marty2000	But it asked me "ignore warning and save file anyway" afterwards
2016-05-07 19:29:22	@Espyo	did it ask you for a source and license?

2016-05-07 19:29:39	@Espyo	what was the warning?
2016-05-07 19:29:49	@Espyo	it shouldn't be asking you that unless you did something like name the file something similar to an existing file
2016-05-07 19:30:12	Marty2000	Sorry... I can't remember, but it probably had something with the extension: when I named the image, I forgot to put the extension
2016-05-07 19:30:17	Marty2000	jpeg, png....
2016-05-07 19:30:24	Marty2000	something to do *
2016-05-07 19:30:26	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 19:30:27	@Espyo	let me try
2016-05-07 19:31:05	Marty2000	About thge French marigols, you can see them with the KopPad in the 2D section
2016-05-07 19:31:10	Marty2000	the*
2016-05-07 19:31:23	@Espyo	wow...
2016-05-07 19:31:23	@Espyo	so yeah
2016-05-07 19:31:27	@Espyo	if you get sent to the warning page
2016-05-07 19:31:30	@Espyo	it forgets everything you wrote
2016-05-07 19:31:59	@Espyo	well, I'll do something about it
2016-05-07 19:32:00	@Espyo	I hope
2016-05-07 19:32:04	Marty2000	I should have paid more attention, I usually choose "ignore and save..." 
2016-05-07 19:32:11	Marty2000	But thanks
2016-05-07 19:32:13	@Espyo	but you shouldn't
2016-05-07 19:32:16	@Espyo	it NEEDS an extension
2016-05-07 19:32:38	Marty2000	Okay

2016-05-07 19:38:12	@Espyo	the text box for the file description on a normal upload page doesn't have an ID
2016-05-07 19:38:22	@Espyo	so to get to it, you have to navigate through the document's parts until you get it
2016-05-07 19:38:27	@Espyo	but on the warning page, it does
2016-05-07 19:39:05	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-07 19:42:22	@Espyo	phew
2016-05-07 19:42:23	@Espyo	it works
2016-05-07 19:42:29	@Espyo	please go to the upload page and do ctrl+f5
2016-05-07 19:42:42	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 19:43:00	@Espyo	ok, now if you upload something without an extension, or with any other upload warning...
2016-05-07 19:43:07	@Espyo	it'll take you to the warning page, but keep the description as-is
2016-05-07 19:43:24	@Espyo	it'll also hide the new fields, unfortunately
2016-05-07 19:43:26	Marty2000	I'll check, but thanks for fixing
2016-05-07 19:43:29	@Espyo	but normally the user doesn't need to change anything else
2016-05-07 19:43:32	@Espyo	thank you for noticing
2016-05-07 19:43:44	@Espyo	better to be fixed now than later, after somebody uploads 100 images...
2016-05-07 19:44:59	Marty2000	Yes, everyhting is kept now

2016-05-07 20:03:06	@Espyo	hey Marty
2016-05-07 20:03:08	@Espyo	is your wiki in English?
2016-05-07 20:03:21	Marty2000	My wiki?
2016-05-07 20:03:26	@Espyo	well, Pikipedia
2016-05-07 20:03:30	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 20:03:31	@Espyo	I'm asking if it's in English for you
2016-05-07 20:03:41	Marty2000	Yes it is
2016-05-07 20:03:44	@Espyo	can you make a screenshot of the upload screen and upload it to the wiki?
2016-05-07 20:03:51	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:03:57	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/4/48/Pikan_1.jpg
2016-05-07 20:03:59	@Espyo	similar to this
2016-05-07 20:04:18	@Espyo	I'd do it, but my wiki's in Portuguese, and my theme is the KopPad one, so having to switch out and back in is a pain :|
2016-05-07 20:04:56	@Espyo	you only need the fields on the "File description" section
2016-05-07 20:04:58	Marty2000	I have the KopPad theme, I think...
2016-05-07 20:05:03	@Espyo	hmm... I guess you can fill in some fields if you want
2016-05-07 20:05:09	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:05:10	@Espyo	try this then: http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:Upload&useskin=monobook
2016-05-07 20:05:22	@Espyo	having the URL like that forces the wiki to use a specific theme
2016-05-07 20:05:23	Marty2000	Ah, yes, I see it
2016-05-07 20:05:27	@Espyo	ok, thanks

2016-05-07 20:06:40	Marty2000	Is it okay for you?
2016-05-07 20:06:44	@Espyo	yeah, that works
2016-05-07 20:06:45	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-07 20:07:00	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-07 20:08:26	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/18/1462648099-1.png
2016-05-07 20:08:29	Marty2000	Description : okay?
2016-05-07 20:08:55	@Espyo	oh, I was uploading it on my end
2016-05-07 20:08:59	@Espyo	especially since I wanted to crop it
2016-05-07 20:09:08	@Espyo	plus... I'm starting to notice
2016-05-07 20:09:16	@Espyo	I might have to do some changes because of this image
2016-05-07 20:09:19	@Espyo	it's not really a game screenshot
2016-05-07 20:09:22	@Espyo	and none of the other types work
2016-05-07 20:09:37	@Espyo	this is a wiki image [[Category:Pikipedia images]]
2016-05-07 20:09:38	Testyo	"Category:Pikipedia_images" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Pikipedia_images
2016-05-07 20:09:42	Marty2000	Oh, okay, I thouhgt I had to upload it
2016-05-07 20:09:46	@Espyo	so I'll have to think of some way to make the script do that
2016-05-07 20:09:52	@Espyo	well, I did ask you to upload
2016-05-07 20:09:54	Marty2000	Yes, it's not a screenshot
2016-05-07 20:09:57	@Espyo	but since you linked me to the images
2016-05-07 20:09:59	@Espyo	I figured you forgot
2016-05-07 20:10:04	@Espyo	so I just went ahead and took care of it
2016-05-07 20:10:04	@Espyo	heh
2016-05-07 20:10:10	@Espyo	well, you don't need to worry about the upload
2016-05-07 20:10:15	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:10:18	@Espyo	but I'll still use the image you took, so thanks
2016-05-07 20:10:26	Marty2000	No problem
2016-05-07 20:11:43	Marty2000	By the way, I didn't know the wiki had several languages
2016-05-07 20:14:44	@Espyo	yep, it's on the settings
2016-05-07 20:14:48	@Espyo	I think these translations are universal
2016-05-07 20:14:53	@Espyo	and they only apply to the interface
2016-05-07 20:14:58	@Espyo	so, not the articles
2016-05-07 20:14:59	Marty2000	Well, I'll keep English anyway
2016-05-07 20:15:06	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:15:08	@Espyo	by universal, I mean I think all wikis use the same translations
2016-05-07 20:15:17	@Espyo	...maybe not wikia, because they hate the MediaWiki system for some reason
2016-05-07 20:15:27	@Espyo	or they don't hate it, but love to mangle it
2016-05-07 20:15:42	@Espyo	some things on MediaWiki are pretty useful in that you can do it the same on all wikias
2016-05-07 20:15:45	@Espyo	sorry, on all wikis
2016-05-07 20:15:48	@Espyo	all wikis running MediaWiki
2016-05-07 20:15:56	Marty2000	I see
2016-05-07 20:16:01	@Espyo	but wikis on wikia use an altered version of MediaWiki that just messes with SO MUCH of the way stuff works
2016-05-07 20:16:09	@Espyo	it breaks so many standards, compatibilities, etc.
2016-05-07 20:16:22	@Espyo	sometimes, it makes sense, because of all the aggressive changes wikia has in the way it does wikis
2016-05-07 20:16:34	@Espyo	but other times, they just change stuff because they're idiots and don't understand how MediaWiki works
2016-05-07 20:16:40	@Espyo	it's a nightmare if you actually look behind the scenes
2016-05-07 20:16:41	@Espyo	but
2016-05-07 20:16:44	@Espyo	it's not our problem any more
2016-05-07 20:17:29	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:22:12	Marty2000	By the way, for those who are here : http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Marty/Decoration What do you think I should add or modify to make it a potential article?
2016-05-07 20:23:55	Marty2000	Of course I have to modify the introduction
2016-05-07 20:24:01	Marty2000	But what about the rest?
2016-05-07 20:27:01	@Espyo	(one sec)
2016-05-07 20:30:36	@Espyo	...we have nearly 8000 files
2016-05-07 20:31:19	Marty2000	That's huge
2016-05-07 20:38:06	@Espyo	well, for one thing, your introduction paragraph needs to change
2016-05-07 20:38:13	@Espyo	but you probably already know that
2016-05-07 20:38:18	Marty2000	Yep
2016-05-07 20:38:20	@Espyo	instead of "Made by humans", I'd go with "Manmade"
2016-05-07 20:38:24	@Espyo	uhm, "Man-made"?
2016-05-07 20:38:35	@Espyo	I wrote "Manmade" and HexChat underlined it in red, meaning it's not a word
2016-05-07 20:38:36	@Espyo	*shrug*
2016-05-07 20:38:55	Marty2000	The problem is that there are things that are not man-made 
2016-05-07 20:38:56	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=User:Marty/Decoration#Buckets
2016-05-07 20:39:05	Marty2000	The bucket on Hocotate

2016-05-07 20:39:18	@Espyo	well, you still call the section "Made by humans"
2016-05-07 20:39:22	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-07 20:39:23	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 20:39:28	Marty2000	The section
2016-05-07 20:39:35	@Espyo	yeah, just the section, I mean
2016-05-07 20:39:36	Marty2000	I thought you were talking about the entire article's name
2016-05-07 20:39:40	@Espyo	hehe, nah
2016-05-07 20:39:41	Marty2000	Sure
2016-05-07 20:40:18	Marty2000	Modifed. I'll try thinking of a better introduction paragraph right now
2016-05-07 20:40:36	@Espyo	you can probably put the screwdrivers paired up with the wrenches, spanners, and pliers
2016-05-07 20:40:44	@Espyo	and change the section to something that fits all of those
2016-05-07 20:40:47	@Espyo	but what, exactly...?
2016-05-07 20:40:50	@Espyo	there must be a name for them
2016-05-07 20:40:53	@Espyo	"hardware tools"?
2016-05-07 20:41:05	Marty2000	Sounds good to me
2016-05-07 20:41:08	@Espyo	I think it's best if you make your modifications, but don't save the file just yet

2016-05-07 20:42:05	@Espyo	"Tyres, wheels and rims" can probably also be changed
2016-05-07 20:42:08	@Espyo	like... wheel-related
2016-05-07 20:42:17	@Espyo	also off-topic, but "tyres" is the UK spelling

2016-05-07 20:42:21	@Espyo	it's "tires" in the US
2016-05-07 20:42:28	@Espyo	(the wiki uses the US spelling whenever possible)
2016-05-07 20:42:33	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:42:42	@Espyo	>Gutters, manholes and sewers
2016-05-07 20:42:49	@Espyo	you can probably call that just "Sewage"
2016-05-07 20:43:08	@Espyo	>Tiles, fabric, carpets and other patterns.
2016-05-07 20:43:23	@Espyo	(ignoring the period at the end of that title :|) maybe just call this "patterns"
2016-05-07 20:43:39	@Espyo	>Food containers and Ramune bottles.
2016-05-07 20:43:43	@Espyo	try "food and drink containers"
2016-05-07 20:43:58	Marty2000	I'm modifying, thanks
2016-05-07 20:44:03	@Espyo	just because the only drink-related objects of notice are ramune bottles doesn't mean you can't put them in a category for drink containers
2016-05-07 20:44:19	@Espyo	also a lot of these need a link to other main articles
2016-05-07 20:44:20	@Espyo	like
2016-05-07 20:44:22	@Espyo	on the Drawings section
2016-05-07 20:44:29	@Espyo	you should have a {{see also}} linking to [[Pikmin drawings]]
2016-05-07 20:44:29	Testyo	"Pikmin_drawings" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pikmin_drawings
2016-05-07 20:44:30	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 20:44:34	@Espyo	or maybe a {{see}}, or {{main}}
2016-05-07 20:44:34	Testyo	"see" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:see
2016-05-07 20:44:40	@Espyo	or maybe just a link in the description of the section itself
2016-05-07 20:44:43	Marty2000	I'd say a {{main}} is better
2016-05-07 20:44:44	Testyo	"main" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:main
2016-05-07 20:44:44	@Espyo	can't really see which one is better
2016-05-07 20:44:59	@Espyo	yeah, but main should only be used when that article is the main article for the subject you're talking about here
2016-05-07 20:45:12	@Espyo	in this case, you'd be saying that the Pikmin drawings article is the main subject for decorative drawings
2016-05-07 20:45:14	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 20:45:14	@Espyo	which it isn't
2016-05-07 20:45:24	@Espyo	it's only the main article for, well, the P3 drawings of Pikmin
2016-05-07 20:45:40	@Espyo	>Wooden items and statues
2016-05-07 20:45:44	@Espyo	the other suit statues aren't made of wood
2016-05-07 20:45:46	@Espyo	they look like plastic
2016-05-07 20:45:56	@Espyo	what other title could we go with...?
2016-05-07 20:46:02	@Espyo	shape statues?
2016-05-07 20:46:08	@Espyo	shape blocks?
2016-05-07 20:46:11	Marty2000	Wooden items and shape statues
2016-05-07 20:46:12	@Espyo	shape objects
2016-05-07 20:46:15	@Espyo	yeah, maybe shape objects
2016-05-07 20:46:23	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:46:27	@Espyo	I'd say even the wooden trees can fall under a "shaped object"
2016-05-07 20:46:46	@Espyo	>Gloves and shoes
2016-05-07 20:46:48	@Espyo	maybe clothing?
2016-05-07 20:47:03	@Espyo	it's best if the titles are more generic than a list of specific things
2016-05-07 20:47:08	Marty2000	Yeah, probably better
2016-05-07 20:47:17	@Espyo	otherwise it doesn't look so much like a section as it looks like you just jumbled a bunch of different subjects together for no reason

2016-05-07 20:47:50	@Espyo	I'd join the control valves and taps
2016-05-07 20:47:54	@Espyo	they're pretty similar
2016-05-07 20:48:23	@Espyo	hmm... as I read through the article, it's increasingly harder to decide what the article even is about...
2016-05-07 20:48:23	Marty2000	I'll join them
2016-05-07 20:48:28	@Espyo	sure, decoration fits, but...
2016-05-07 20:48:34	@Espyo	stuff like the Monster Pump in Pikmin 2 isn't decoration
2016-05-07 20:48:37	@Espyo	although it's still noteworthy
2016-05-07 20:48:51	@Espyo	well, I guess the subject is still decoration
2016-05-07 20:48:52	Marty2000	Oh yeah, just added it to make a link with what we can retrieve in-game
2016-05-07 20:49:06	@Espyo	but for situations like the Monster Pump, you should say that it's not decoration
2016-05-07 20:49:10	@Espyo	but it's a treasure
2016-05-07 20:49:23	Marty2000	I would rename the article as "background objects" or "background information"
2016-05-07 20:49:28	Marty2000	Maybe "background decoration"
2016-05-07 20:49:31	@Espyo	I think decoration still works
2016-05-07 20:49:39	@Espyo	because there are a lot of items here that aren't in the background
2016-05-07 20:49:44	@Espyo	like shells in the middle of the stage
2016-05-07 20:49:51	@Espyo	or the tambourine or xylophone that make up the cave itself
2016-05-07 20:50:00	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:50:06	@Espyo	I'd say Decoration works fine
2016-05-07 20:50:12	@Espyo	but like I said, for stuff like the Monster Pump...
2016-05-07 20:50:15	@Espyo	it's not really a decoration
2016-05-07 20:50:36	@Espyo	so you should specify that despite not being decoration, the a tap also appears in Pikmin 2, in the form of the Monster Pump treasure
2016-05-07 20:50:52	Marty2000	I think I mentioned it
2016-05-07 20:50:53	Marty2000	Wait
2016-05-07 20:51:11	@Espyo	it's really weird to have a top-level section on items from the sea, and then right after have a second-level section about ammonites, which are sea creatures
2016-05-07 20:51:14	@Espyo	it can probably be organized better
2016-05-07 20:51:34	Marty2000	http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:Marty/Decoration#Control_valves_and_taps
2016-05-07 20:51:48	Marty2000	Well, we need a btter name.. but I mentioned the Monster Pump is a treasure
2016-05-07 20:51:58	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 20:52:01	Marty2000	"A tap appears in Pikmin 2 as a treasure"

2016-05-07 20:52:39	@Espyo	hey, you should probably put the chiyogami in the article too
2016-05-07 20:52:50	Marty2000	"From the sea" can be merged with "remains of creatures" I think
2016-05-07 20:52:57	@Espyo	yeah, I think so too
2016-05-07 20:53:05	Marty2000	It's already in the article
2016-05-07 20:53:13	@Espyo	(also, rename that to Creature remains)

2016-05-07 20:53:38	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-07 20:53:43	@Espyo	I tried searching for it, didn't find it
2016-05-07 20:53:56	@Espyo	also, try "Plumbing items" for the "Control valves and taps" section
2016-05-07 20:54:18	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:54:26	@Espyo	oh, one important thing
2016-05-07 20:54:30	@Espyo	have you ran Pikan on this article?
2016-05-07 20:54:36	Marty2000	No
2016-05-07 20:54:39	@Espyo	try it
2016-05-07 20:54:42	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-07 20:54:45	@Espyo	it should help you fix a lot of the article's problems
2016-05-07 20:55:06	@Espyo	other than that... I don't know, I guess I'd try merging some more sections
2016-05-07 20:55:11	@Espyo	because the table of contents is pretty long

2016-05-07 20:59:58	--	Chiaki_Nanami is now known as sleepi
2016-05-07 21:03:46	Marty2000	Ok, Pikan detects no problem now. I corrected all of them
2016-05-07 21:06:55	@Espyo	awesome
2016-05-07 21:06:59	@Espyo	remember, you don't HAVE to correct all of them
2016-05-07 21:07:03	@Espyo	some of them could be questions
2016-05-07 21:07:10	Marty2000	Yes, I saw
2016-05-07 21:07:13	@Espyo	like, Pikan THINKS there is a problem, and is telling you about it, but there might not be
2016-05-07 21:07:15	@Espyo	all right, cool
2016-05-07 21:07:22	Marty2000	But they were all problems in this case

2016-05-07 21:07:42	@Espyo	other than that, like I said, try to merge some more sections
2016-05-07 21:07:50	@Espyo	and oh, remove the spaces before colons
2016-05-07 21:07:55	@Espyo	it's not really normal outside of France, it seems...
2016-05-07 21:08:04	Marty2000	Ah, yes
2016-05-07 21:09:13	Marty2000	Well, it's quite different here: you need a space for : ? ! and our keyboard is different too
2016-05-07 21:09:31	Marty2000	But I forgot, so I'm going to modify
2016-05-07 21:10:39	Marty2000	Done
2016-05-07 21:10:53	@Espyo	you need a space? really?
2016-05-07 21:10:53	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-07 21:11:02	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 21:11:12	@Espyo	I know different keyboards have different quirks
2016-05-07 21:11:39	@Espyo	like, to write an accentuated character, I (and probably you) have to type the accent first ' ` ^ ~ and then the vowel
2016-05-07 21:11:58	Marty2000	Depends on the accent
2016-05-07 21:12:25	Marty2000	é and è are mixed up with ~and `

2016-05-07 21:12:48	Marty2000	For ¨, you need to type it before the letter
2016-05-07 21:12:54	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-07 21:13:02	@Espyo	do you use " in French?
2016-05-07 21:13:09	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-07 21:13:10	@Espyo	wait
2016-05-07 21:13:16	@Espyo	did that come out as a quote, or as an Umlaut?
2016-05-07 21:13:26	@Espyo	I think my HexChat is glitching
2016-05-07 21:13:27	Marty2000	Quote
2016-05-07 21:13:31	@Espyo	crap lol
2016-05-07 21:13:35	@Espyo	that was meant to be an umlaut
2016-05-07 21:13:37	Marty2000	But don't worry, I understood
2016-05-07 21:13:42	@Espyo	oh, good
2016-05-07 21:13:43	@Espyo	thanks
2016-05-07 21:13:55	@Espyo	weird... I don't remember seeing one in any French word
2016-05-07 21:14:02	@Espyo	I did learn French back in 5th grade or something
2016-05-07 21:14:04	Marty2000	So, I suppose your keyboard begins with the letters qwerty in Portugal, right?
2016-05-07 21:14:10	@Espyo	...but I don't remember most of it
2016-05-07 21:14:15	@Espyo	yeah, it's QWERTY
2016-05-07 21:14:26	Marty2000	In France, it's AZERTY
2016-05-07 21:14:35	@Espyo	ah, I think I remember this
2016-05-07 21:14:36	Marty2000	Oh, so you learnt French? Great
2016-05-07 21:14:38	UltraMario	where's pikfan

2016-05-07 21:14:44	Marty2000	Hi UltraMario
2016-05-07 21:14:54	@Espyo	I have to say, French wasn't one of my strongest subjects back then
2016-05-07 21:14:56	UltraMario	there's a troll in his chat
2016-05-07 21:14:57	@Espyo	but English was super easy
2016-05-07 21:15:14	@Espyo	in fact, French classes was when I got my first negative grade
2016-05-07 21:15:17	@Espyo	I went home crying hehe
2016-05-07 21:15:22	@Espyo	UltraMario: how so?
2016-05-07 21:15:24	Marty2000	English is my stronget subject with Spanish
2016-05-07 21:15:34	Marty2000	The problem with French
2016-05-07 21:15:39	@Espyo	the verbs...

2016-05-07 21:16:18	Marty2000	But I am not fluent yet
2016-05-07 21:16:25	Marty2000	I still make lots of mistakes
2016-05-07 21:16:29	@Espyo	you'll get there
2016-05-07 21:16:34	@Espyo	yeah, they're noticeable
2016-05-07 21:16:36	@Espyo	but they're not bad
2016-05-07 21:16:37	Marty2000	Yes, probably
2016-05-07 21:16:38	@Espyo	they're pretty harmless
2016-05-07 21:17:25	Yoshi2	the main issue with English is the pronounciation
2016-05-07 21:17:31	@Espyo	hehehe
2016-05-07 21:17:48	@Espyo	pronunciation always comes out natural for me
2016-05-07 21:17:57	@Espyo	you know what doesn't come out natural in the pronunciation?
2016-05-07 21:18:00	@Espyo	the spelling of that exact damn word
2016-05-07 21:18:05	@Espyo	it's not proNOUNCiation
2016-05-07 21:18:06	Marty2000	It's thanks to video-games that I could learn the bases, because.. well, maybe it's my school, but we're not taught many things in English
2016-05-07 21:18:08	@Espyo	it's proNUNciation
2016-05-07 21:18:10	@Espyo	I always get it wrong
2016-05-07 21:18:14	@Espyo	and it looks like you got it wrong too, Yoshi2
2016-05-07 21:18:31	@Espyo	really? I had English classes in... 5th and 6th grade, if I'm not mistaken
2016-05-07 21:18:38	@Espyo	but yeah, I learned most of my English through Cartoon Network
2016-05-07 21:18:47	Marty2000	Oh, I have English classes too
2016-05-07 21:18:48	Yoshi2	I had a feeling that I got it wrong
2016-05-07 21:18:59	Marty2000	It's just that we're still learning how to say our name
2016-05-07 21:19:05	@Espyo	yikes
2016-05-07 21:19:21	Marty2000	Well, maybe more, but that's pretty much the same things over and over
2016-05-07 21:19:32	@Espyo	right
2016-05-07 21:19:33	Yoshi2	it's "pronounce", but "pronunciation"
2016-05-07 21:19:33	@Espyo	ugh, that sucks
2016-05-07 21:19:35	Yoshi2	like
2016-05-07 21:19:38	Yoshi2	what the fuck
2016-05-07 21:19:39	@Espyo	Yoshi2: ikr
2016-05-07 21:19:41	Yoshi2	were they thinking
2016-05-07 21:19:52	Marty2000	By the way, many English words resemble the French ones
2016-05-07 21:19:57	Marty2000	So many...
2016-05-07 21:20:00	@Espyo	and you actually pronounce it as "pronounciation"
2016-05-07 21:20:09	@Espyo	yeah, because of the Latin roots
2016-05-07 21:20:11	@Espyo	same for Portuguese
2016-05-07 21:20:14	Marty2000	Yeah
2016-05-07 21:20:17	@Espyo	but those words end up not being all that common in English
2016-05-07 21:20:30	Marty2000	Some are formal in English, yeah
2016-05-07 21:20:37	@Espyo	every once in a while, I say the English equivalent to a word that is common in Portuguese
2016-05-07 21:20:41	@Espyo	and most people don't get what I'm saying
2016-05-07 21:20:44	@Espyo	but to me it's pretty normal
2016-05-07 21:20:46	@Espyo	it's so fun
2016-05-07 21:20:57	@Espyo	ooh, here's a fun one from some weeks back
2016-05-07 21:20:59	@Espyo	aberration
2016-05-07 21:21:06	Marty2000	Yeah, that's the same for me, we use words that seem formal
2016-05-07 21:21:20	@Espyo	I love these little culture barrier quirks
2016-05-07 21:21:20	Marty2000	Is "aberration" rare in English?
2016-05-07 21:21:27	@Espyo	yeah, it's pretty rare
2016-05-07 21:21:31	Marty2000	Oh
2016-05-07 21:21:33	@Espyo	and yet, it's an everyday word in Portuguese
2016-05-07 21:21:39	@Espyo	well, maybe not everyday, but you know, it's a normal word
2016-05-07 21:21:42	Marty2000	It's an everyday word here too
2016-05-07 21:21:53	Marty2000	Yes, I see
2016-05-07 21:21:56	@Espyo	hehe, I imagined it was
2016-05-07 21:23:18	Marty2000	By the way, maybe it's the same for you Espyo, but sometimes, it's quite easy to understand another Romance language when your native language is also a romance one
2016-05-07 21:23:32	Marty2000	Even if you don't speak the target language
2016-05-07 21:23:43	@Espyo	yeah, exactly
2016-05-07 21:23:55	@Espyo	in fact
2016-05-07 21:24:04	@Espyo	chances are I can type a sentence in Portuguese here and you can guess half of the words
2016-05-07 21:24:06	@Espyo	let's see...
2016-05-07 21:24:27	@Espyo	Esta frase está em Português, e usa palavras simples e comuns.
2016-05-07 21:24:34	@Espyo	hm, maybe...
2016-05-07 21:24:47	Marty2000	This sentence is in Porttuguese, and it uses simple and common words
2016-05-07 21:24:51	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-07 21:24:52	@Espyo	exactly
2016-05-07 21:24:57	Marty2000	Portuguese*
2016-05-07 21:25:06	Marty2000	It's pretty close to Spanish
2016-05-07 21:25:10	@Espyo	it's true
2016-05-07 21:25:10	Marty2000	So I can understand
2016-05-07 21:25:13	Marty2000	French:
2016-05-07 21:25:33	Marty2000	Cette phrase est en français, elle utilise des mots simples et communs.
2016-05-07 21:25:34	@Espyo	it's convenient too; when a Portuguese goes to Spain, or vice versa, we can just speak our native language, and it's pretty much understood by the other party
2016-05-07 21:25:43	Marty2000	Yes, that's funny
2016-05-07 21:25:46	@Espyo	yep, pretty simple to understand, too
2016-05-07 21:25:58	@Espyo	if I had to guess without knowing what it is before, I might've had a problem with "mots"
2016-05-07 21:26:03	@Espyo	but I could guess "words" from context
2016-05-07 21:26:09	Marty2000	Yes it is
2016-05-07 21:26:16	@Espyo	hehe, this is so much fun
2016-05-07 21:26:26	@Espyo	sometimes, you can KINDA guess some words in German too
2016-05-07 21:26:34	Marty2000	Oh yes
2016-05-07 21:26:36	Yoshi2	that sounded a lot like latin
2016-05-07 21:26:48	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yep, true to a Romance language
2016-05-07 21:26:57	Marty2000	Fun thing : I learnt what "demonstration" meant in English...
2016-05-07 21:27:00	Marty2000	thanks to German
2016-05-07 21:27:01	@Espyo	I remember one time I read a random comic in German, and tried blindly to guess what it was saying
2016-05-07 21:27:08	@Espyo	and to my surprise, I actually got almost all of it right
2016-05-07 21:27:09	Marty2000	Isn't it "demonstration" too in German?
2016-05-07 21:27:13	@Espyo	even though none of the words really meant much to me
2016-05-07 21:27:16	@Espyo	I guess context helped a lot too
2016-05-07 21:27:20	Marty2000	Oh, cool
2016-05-07 21:27:32	@Espyo	hm, weird, you don't have the word demonstration in French?
2016-05-07 21:27:37	@Espyo	demonstração in Portuguese; pretty standard
2016-05-07 21:27:44	Marty2000	We have, but it doesn't mean the same thing
2016-05-07 21:27:49	@Espyo	oh?
2016-05-07 21:27:51	Marty2000	Démonstration = demo
2016-05-07 21:27:58	@Espyo	well, yeah... but what does demo mean?
2016-05-07 21:28:25	Marty2000	Well
2016-05-07 21:28:35	Marty2000	Like Pikmin 3 demo you can get on the Eshop
2016-05-07 21:28:46	@Espyo	yeah, but that's the standard definition of a demonstration
2016-05-07 21:28:47	Marty2000	(isn't it demo?)
2016-05-07 21:28:58	@Espyo	I think demo, or demonstration, means the same everywhere
2016-05-07 21:29:02	@Espyo	a small sample of something
2016-05-07 21:29:12	Marty2000	I thought it had another meaning in English
2016-05-07 21:29:15	@Espyo	ah
2016-05-07 21:29:23	@Espyo	but nope, that's what it means in English too, a small sample
2016-05-07 21:29:27	Yoshi2	Dieser Satz ist in Deutsch, und er benutzt einfache und geläufige Wörter.
2016-05-07 21:29:27	@Espyo	well, I've got dinner, brb
2016-05-07 21:29:40	@Espyo	aww, I want to try to translate that, but I need to go
2016-05-07 21:29:46	@Espyo	eh, it'll still be here when I return
2016-05-07 21:29:48	Marty2000	Enjoy your meal (Yoshi2 is...)
2016-05-07 21:30:03	Marty2000	Yoshi2 : I can understand some parts
2016-05-07 21:30:27	Marty2000	Pretty cool we can guess lots of things
2016-05-07 21:32:18	Yoshi2	the most fun part is changing the sentence structure
2016-05-07 21:32:47	Yoshi2	Dieser Satz, der einfache und geläufige Wörter benutzt, ist in Deutsch.
2016-05-07 21:33:27	Marty2000	Oh, you can something similar in English and other languages, can't you?
2016-05-07 21:33:33	Marty2000	can do*
2016-05-07 21:33:46	Yoshi2	likely
2016-05-07 21:34:03	Marty2000	This sentence, with common and simple words, is in English
2016-05-07 21:34:24	Marty2000	Is it the sentence you wrote?
2016-05-07 21:34:25	Yoshi2	*which uses common and simple words
2016-05-07 21:34:38	Marty2000	Oh I see

2016-05-07 21:44:30	@Espyo	This sentence is in German, and it... doesn't enforce and complex words?
2016-05-07 21:44:40	@Espyo	eh, I mean, I guess it's the same sentence we wrote before in Portuguese and French
2016-05-07 21:44:43	@Espyo	but wow, it's tricky
2016-05-07 21:45:00	@Espyo	yyyyyep, it's the same sentence
2016-05-07 21:45:07	@Espyo	and yeah, you can switch it around in almost all languages
2016-05-07 21:45:09	Marty2000	Yes, it is the same
2016-05-07 21:45:21	@Espyo	weird... "words" is capitalized
2016-05-07 21:45:26	@Espyo	Wörter
2016-05-07 21:45:31	Marty2000	Nouns are capitalized in German

2016-05-08 01:20:25	Marty2000	at one*
2016-05-08 01:21:50	@Espyo	oh
2016-05-08 01:22:00	@Espyo	that's simply because of the shortest path, I bet
2016-05-08 01:22:53	Marty2000	I don't know... because if that was the case, when they took the Cupid's Grenades that are just behind, they should have taken the same path
2016-05-08 01:23:03	Marty2000	WHich is not the case

2016-05-08 12:37:35	Yoshi2	an accurate representation of um's keyboard, but you SHOULD be able to see it o.o
2016-05-08 12:37:39	UltraMario	btw i  replaced the victory themes with the melee themes
2016-05-08 12:37:42	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-08 12:38:03	Yoshi2	Espyo: what do you think of this http://www.pikminwiki.com/User:TabuuandPeach#my_images
2016-05-08 12:38:07	Marty2000	A blank image

2016-05-08 12:39:12	@Espyo	well, the image is not doing anything anti-Semitic
2016-05-08 12:39:16	@Espyo	and it doesn't go over the personal image limit
2016-05-08 12:39:23	UltraMario	heh
2016-05-08 12:40:04	Yoshi2	the only issue I have with the image is the license
2016-05-08 12:40:22	Yoshi2	time for a reverse image search
2016-05-08 12:40:24	@Espyo	looks like it came from Mediawiki Commons
2016-05-08 12:40:32	@Espyo	but he just spaghetti'd all over the place while trying to explain that
2016-05-08 12:42:34	Yoshi2	https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1990-048-29A,_Adolf_Hitler.jpg ah, it is a recolor of this

2016-05-08 12:47:09	Marty2000	Ah
2016-05-08 12:47:26	Marty2000	Should we conclude that Hitler liked burping Bulborbs?

2016-05-08 12:49:21	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-08 12:50:19	Yoshi2	probably not colored by him
2016-05-08 12:52:36	@Espyo	can you really not find the original?
2016-05-08 12:52:53	@Espyo	well, colored original

2016-05-08 12:54:16	@Espyo	yes
2016-05-08 12:54:57	Marty2000	Well, I can post a message right now, unless someone else wants to do it

2016-05-08 12:59:10	UltraMario	"im just here to upload images"
2016-05-08 12:59:14	UltraMario	uh
2016-05-08 12:59:17	@Espyo	TCRF has a rule that goes something like "don't edit an article JUST to add or remove comedy"
2016-05-08 12:59:23	UltraMario	it better be contributive images
2016-05-08 12:59:31	@Espyo	that sarcastic "blatant product placement" on the article was comedy
2016-05-08 12:59:34	@Espyo	and he removed it
2016-05-08 12:59:37	@Espyo	I can see a very quick ban
2016-05-08 12:59:42	Marty2000	Ha ha, it was funny, by the way
2016-05-08 12:59:42	@Espyo	hehe, in fact...

2016-05-08 13:03:56	Yoshi2	it seems like tabuu doesn't have anything malicious in mind, but he did not read the tcrf rules, to say the least

2016-05-08 13:07:05	UltraMario	rip
2016-05-08 13:07:23	Marty2000	That was a good match, but you didn't get lucky with the Warlock Punch
2016-05-08 13:07:27	UltraMario	yeah :p
2016-05-08 13:07:27	Marty2000	When you fell
2016-05-08 13:07:39	@Espyo	yes
2016-05-08 13:07:40	UltraMario	i shouldved waited till the blocks unflip
2016-05-08 13:07:45	@Espyo	he's not the first user to barge right in and undo a joke
2016-05-08 13:07:55	@Espyo	but still, Tabuu is just... weird
2016-05-08 13:07:55	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/File:Pikmin_2_res_floor_name_eng_pal_err.bti.png
2016-05-08 13:08:15	Marty2000	With the code for English in the Japanese version, those things appear
2016-05-08 13:08:22	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/images/1/10/Pikmin_2_res_floor_name_eng_pal_err.bti.png
2016-05-08 13:08:56	@Espyo	really? where on?
2016-05-08 13:09:00	Marty2000	More precisely, they replace the name of the cave when you enter it or one of its sublevel
2016-05-08 13:09:09	UltraMario	melee ganondorf is best ganondorf btw
2016-05-08 13:09:20	Marty2000	Then you can see the original name with the radar (Submerged Castle = Lookout castle or something like that)
2016-05-08 13:09:26	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-08 13:09:28	@Espyo	how weird
2016-05-08 13:09:37	Marty2000	Wait, when I finish, I'll take a screenshot on Dolphin
2016-05-08 13:09:48	Marty2000	So you can see
2016-05-08 13:09:54	@Espyo	all right
2016-05-08 13:09:57	UltraMario	i wonder if ganondorf will ever be his own character
2016-05-08 13:09:58	UltraMario	:P
2016-05-08 13:10:15	Marty2000	His moves are very similar to CaptainFalcon's
2016-05-08 13:10:18	UltraMario	yup
2016-05-08 13:10:20	UltraMario	he's a semiclone
2016-05-08 13:10:48	@Espyo	he's pretty unique in Smash 4
2016-05-08 13:10:52	@Espyo	I wouldn't call him a semiclone
2016-05-08 13:10:53	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-08 13:10:57	UltraMario	well
2016-05-08 13:11:03	@Espyo	it still has similarities
2016-05-08 13:11:05	@Espyo	but eh
2016-05-08 13:11:05	UltraMario	he still has captain falcon's moves
2016-05-08 13:11:07	UltraMario	but
2016-05-08 13:11:10	UltraMario	he's more unique
2016-05-08 13:11:11	UltraMario	yeah
2016-05-08 13:11:12	@Espyo	semiclone is like Mario and Luigi in Melee
2016-05-08 13:11:29	UltraMario	people consider lucas a semiclone
2016-05-08 13:11:31	UltraMario	and wolf
2016-05-08 13:11:31	UltraMario	:p
2016-05-08 13:11:34	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-08 13:11:51	Marty2000	I haven't really played the other games (only a little)
2016-05-08 13:12:15	UltraMario	ganondorf was more of a clone in melee
2016-05-08 13:12:20	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-08 13:12:24	UltraMario	he was made more unique in brawl and smash 4

2016-05-08 13:19:35	Marty2000	Hmm... if I could put musics into SSB, I'd put Pikmin or Kirby musics

2016-05-08 13:20:46	Marty2000	I guess it's hacks

2016-05-08 13:20:54	UltraMario	but it's safe
2016-05-08 13:21:15	Marty2000	I had hacked my Wii when I was younger, to play the Japanese version of Pikmin 2
2016-05-08 13:21:19	Marty2000	It was cool
2016-05-08 13:21:21	UltraMario	nice
2016-05-08 13:21:36	Marty2000	Too bad games from other regions do not work without hacks :/

2016-05-08 13:26:28	Marty2000	They say it's the Glutton's Kitchen

2016-05-08 13:31:35	@Espyo	there are as many symbols as there are characters in "CAVE OF EMERGENCE"
2016-05-08 13:31:52	@Espyo	so, it's a error handler for showing characters in a font that doesn't have those characters...
2016-05-08 13:32:06	Marty2000	Do you want the code
2016-05-08 13:32:09	UltraMario	interesting

2016-05-08 13:38:06	Marty2000	Wait, isn't it already in the game?
2016-05-08 13:38:14	UltraMario	yes, but
2016-05-08 13:38:16	UltraMario	it's shorter
2016-05-08 13:38:16	UltraMario	:P

2016-05-08 13:47:39	Marty2000	At the very beginning

2016-05-08 14:03:07	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2/Early_English_Script#Names
2016-05-08 14:03:29	Marty2000	They say "The Purple Hothouse = Citadel of Spiders"
2016-05-08 14:04:06	Marty2000	Actually
2016-05-08 14:04:17	Marty2000	The Purple Hothouse is the White Flower Garden
2016-05-08 14:04:25	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/18/1462712657-the-purple-hothouse.png
2016-05-08 14:08:51	Marty2000	Another strange thing :

2016-05-08 14:22:05	Marty2000	The screenshot proves that you can see them
2016-05-08 14:31:15	@Espyo	yeah, it's the same texture
2016-05-08 14:31:16	@Espyo	cool
2016-05-08 14:31:54	Marty2000	So, I'm trying to get the early names of all caves
2016-05-08 14:32:19	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2/Early_English_Script#Names I think well need to modify them
2016-05-08 14:32:22	Marty2000	we'll
2016-05-08 14:38:40	Marty2000	It's really weird
2016-05-08 14:39:29	Marty2000	The Shower Room is called Garden of White Flowers, and the Glutton's Kitchen is called The Submarine Castle
2016-05-08 14:40:03	UltraMario	maybe they werent supposed to be those at all
2016-05-08 14:40:04	UltraMario	:o
2016-05-08 14:42:09	Marty2000	It would be more logic for the Submerged Castle to have The Submarine Castle as an early name....
2016-05-08 14:42:16	Marty2000	more logical*
2016-05-08 14:43:49	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2016-05-08 14:54:53	--	sleepi is now known as Chiaki_Nanami
2016-05-08 15:00:29	@Espyo	Marty2000: you never added the glitch that allows you to push 1-weight objects with rolling

2016-05-08 15:02:28	Marty2000	I'll do it soon
2016-05-08 15:02:29	Marty2000	Sorry
2016-05-08 15:03:18	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2/Early_English_Script#Names
2016-05-08 15:03:27	Marty2000	Ok, so the names that need modifying:
2016-05-08 15:03:41	Marty2000	White Flower Garden = The Purple Hothouse
2016-05-08 15:03:57	Marty2000	Citadel of Spiders = Well of Waves
2016-05-08 15:04:15	Marty2000	Shower Room = Garden of White Flowers
2016-05-08 15:04:28	@Espyo	hmm? what do you mean "need modifying"?
2016-05-08 15:04:45	Marty2000	Glutton's Kitchen = The Submarine Castle
2016-05-08 15:05:24	Marty2000	We should perhaps change the names.. For example, the Glutton's Kitchen was going to be called The Submarine Castle
2016-05-08 15:05:55	Marty2000	Even though The Submarine Castle has become the Submerged Castle (but a different cave has this name now)
2016-05-08 15:06:12	Marty2000	The Submarine Castle = Lookout Ruins
2016-05-08 15:06:19	Marty2000	Submerged Castle*

2016-05-08 15:07:38	@Espyo	I don't understand... change the names where?
2016-05-08 15:08:30	Marty2000	https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2/Early_English_Script#Names ===Cave Names===
2016-05-08 15:08:58	Marty2000	It's not wrong, but look : it's said that The Submarine Castle = Submerged Castle
2016-05-08 15:09:25	Marty2000	It's not wrong, but actually, in game, with the English names, when you try to enter the Submerged Castle,
2016-05-08 15:09:30	Marty2000	it is shown "Lookout Ruins"
2016-05-08 15:09:46	Marty2000	Which probably means it was the early name of the cave

2016-05-08 15:13:42	Marty2000	http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/18/1462716767-tcrf.png The Purple Hothouse is normally not the Citadel of Spiders
2016-05-08 15:14:26	@Espyo	hm, but I'm wondering if this a glitch with the code
2016-05-08 15:14:28	@Espyo	it probably isn't
2016-05-08 15:14:34	@Espyo	let me check the game files themselves
2016-05-08 15:14:38	Marty2000	Okay

2016-05-08 15:20:15	@Espyo	uhm
2016-05-08 15:20:19	@Espyo	by checking the game files...
2016-05-08 15:20:29	@Espyo	the Citadel of Spiders used to be called Well of Waves
2016-05-08 15:20:59	@Espyo	and the Purple Hothouse is the White Flower Garden
2016-05-08 15:21:16	@Espyo	looks like the person that wrote the article dun goof'd
2016-05-08 15:21:23	@Espyo	but why...?

2016-05-08 15:22:08	Marty2000	And this too https://tcrf.net/Pikmin_2#Awakening_Wood_Cherry_Blossoms
2016-05-08 15:22:19	@Espyo	the cherry blossoms have been deleted already
2016-05-08 15:22:24	@Espyo	I cleaned up the article slightly
2016-05-08 15:22:31	@Espyo	and pointed out that weird error character thing
2016-05-08 15:22:47	Marty2000	Oh okay

2016-05-08 15:25:44	Marty2000	Hi Nvortex
2016-05-08 15:25:59	Nvortex	can i add the /possible/ double meaning of the japanese waterwraith name?
2016-05-08 15:26:17	Nvortex	it seems to be a pun
2016-05-08 15:26:31	Nvortex	you were the one that found it right?
2016-05-08 15:26:39	Nvortex	i don't think it was me

2016-05-08 15:26:59	@Espyo	uh
2016-05-08 15:27:01	@Espyo	I'm not sure
2016-05-08 15:27:14	@Espyo	anyway, why are you removing those things?
2016-05-08 15:27:16	@Espyo	they're valid trivia
2016-05-08 15:27:19	@Espyo	wtf man
2016-05-08 15:27:33	Nvortex	they are stupid
2016-05-08 15:27:37	Nvortex	absolutely stupid
2016-05-08 15:27:57	@Espyo	why
2016-05-08 15:27:59	@Espyo	they're true
2016-05-08 15:29:11	Nvortex	those are obviously not meant to be taken seriously, and if one of them they should have been in every page
2016-05-08 15:29:24	Nvortex	one of them has*
2016-05-08 15:29:44	@Espyo	but they are in every page
2016-05-08 15:29:49	@Espyo	and what makes you say they shouldn't be taken seriously?
2016-05-08 15:29:53	@Espyo	might as well delete the whole wiki
2016-05-08 15:29:56	@Espyo	none of the info is serious
2016-05-08 15:30:32	Nvortex	well if you think this should be taken seriously, louie might be dead already
2016-05-08 15:30:33	Nvortex	"Inedible. Known to cause mass hysteria, followed by leg spasms and internal thunderings."
2016-05-08 15:30:49	@Espyo	of course it's not taken "seriously"
2016-05-08 15:30:54	@Espyo	but it's still an inconsistency of sorts
2016-05-08 15:30:56	@Espyo	it can be noted
2016-05-08 15:31:06	@Espyo	but it's not in the main body of the article because of how minor it is
2016-05-08 15:31:31	Yoshi2	if louie says he knows how to cook it in the game, and the enemy does explode, then I'd say that is a good candidate for fun trivia
2016-05-08 15:31:42	@Espyo	just because it's Louie's notes doesn't mean you can't point out weird (objective) stuff about them
2016-05-08 15:31:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-08 15:31:55	@Espyo	it's not like it's game changing
2016-05-08 15:32:01	@Espyo	or messes with the canon in some convoluted way
2016-05-08 15:32:11	@Espyo	but it's a neat trivia to make people go "...huh, yeah, that's weird."
2016-05-08 15:36:27	Nvortex	put this in google translate アメ ニュウドウ
2016-05-08 15:36:29	Nvortex	and this アメ ボウズ

2016-05-08 15:38:44	@Espyo	...candy?
2016-05-08 15:38:48	Nvortex	yes
2016-05-08 15:38:48	@Espyo	are you sure it's candy, google translate?
2016-05-08 15:38:52	@Espyo	are you sure it's not RAIN?
2016-05-08 15:38:55	@Espyo	dumb translator...
2016-05-08 15:38:55	Nvortex	ame
2016-05-08 15:39:03	@Espyo	ame is rain, isn't it?
2016-05-08 15:39:06	@Espyo	http://jisho.org/search/ame
2016-05-08 15:39:07	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-08 15:39:10	@Espyo	google translate's just being stupid
2016-05-08 15:39:29	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-08 15:39:32	@Espyo	I get what you mean
2016-05-08 15:39:36	Nvortex	what is found in the submerged castle
2016-05-08 15:39:44	Nvortex	what does the wraith look like
2016-05-08 15:39:48	@Espyo	"candy" could refer to his Taffy-like appearance
2016-05-08 15:40:00	@Espyo	uhm, toffee?
2016-05-08 15:40:01	Nvortex	exactly
2016-05-08 15:40:03	@Espyo	I lost the word
2016-05-08 15:40:10	@Espyo	toffee, taffee, taffy
2016-05-08 15:40:14	@Espyo	well, you know what I mean
2016-05-08 15:40:18	@Espyo	that's interesting
2016-05-08 15:40:22	Nvortex	also this seems to be the word for rain 雨
2016-05-08 15:40:28	@Espyo	jisho.org also says rice jelly/candy is a possibility for ame
2016-05-08 15:40:43	Nvortex	wait so you weren't the one who realized the possible pun?
2016-05-08 15:40:53	@Espyo	nope
2016-05-08 15:40:55	@Espyo	this is news to me
2016-05-08 15:41:04	@Espyo	it was probably Dave
2016-05-08 15:41:11	@Espyo	but wait, doesn't that mean the Plasm Wraith has the same pun?
2016-05-08 15:42:27	Nvortex	yeah
2016-05-08 15:42:39	Nvortex	it seems to be a pun on multiple things
2016-05-08 15:42:43	@Espyo	well, we can't be sure that the intended meaning of ame isn't candy, instead of rain
2016-05-08 15:42:53	@Espyo	honestly, "candy priest" is starting to make more sense than "rain priest"
2016-05-08 15:43:05	Nvortex	yeah i don't know if we should change that
2016-05-08 15:43:23	@Espyo	same... I'm not sure if we should
2016-05-08 15:43:38	Nvortex	and make it a major reveal so people stop the umibozu mumbo jumbo
2016-05-08 15:43:40	Testyo	dunno, what really here, playing Smash
2016-05-08 15:44:02	@Espyo	...Testyo
2016-05-08 15:44:03	Testyo	It's also explained earlier in the point was malware won't exist that targets programs used by hardly anyone
2016-05-08 15:44:05	@Espyo	are you suggesting we take the Corrin approach?
2016-05-08 15:44:09	@Espyo	what should we do?
2016-05-08 15:44:15	@Espyo	>keep "rain"
2016-05-08 15:44:18	@Espyo	>change to "candy"
2016-05-08 15:44:19	@Espyo	>play Smash
2016-05-08 15:44:20	Marty2000	Great, Espyo
2016-05-08 15:44:58	Nvortex	make the wraiths be the only creatures to have a multiple meaning name
2016-05-08 15:45:21	@Espyo	I'd rather call it "unknown" meaning than "multiple"
2016-05-08 15:45:26	@Espyo	and then list the possibilities
2016-05-08 15:45:51	Nvortex	but the very first name is the one i'm talking about, the one that appears in the first line
2016-05-08 15:46:01	Nvortex	it's the only one people care about
2016-05-08 15:46:11	@Espyo	in the first line? what line?

2016-05-08 15:46:52	Nvortex	The Waterwraith (アメボウズ?, lit.: "Rain Priest") is a boss from Pikmin 2,
2016-05-08 15:47:59	@Espyo	right
2016-05-08 15:48:03	@Espyo	not sure what to change it to
2016-05-08 15:48:09	@Espyo	we could change it to "Ame" Priest
2016-05-08 15:48:20	@Espyo	and then explain the different meanings of Ame on the Naming section of the article
2016-05-08 15:48:37	Nvortex	by the way i got he meaning ame by adding a space between bouzu
2016-05-08 15:48:46	Nvortex	or completely deleting it
2016-05-08 15:48:49	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-08 15:48:50	Nvortex	just saying
2016-05-08 15:49:04	@Espyo	it's because of the way Japanese works, apparently
2016-05-08 15:49:09	@Espyo	you can have a full name be a run-on word
2016-05-08 15:49:18	@Espyo	if you actually want different parts of the name, you'll have to separate them
2016-05-08 15:49:51	@Espyo	it's like if we called the White Pikmin cave the Whiteflowergarden
2016-05-08 15:49:53	Nvortex	but waith
2016-05-08 15:49:56	Nvortex	lel
2016-05-08 15:49:58	Marty2000	Yes, in Japanese you do not put spaces
2016-05-08 15:50:00	Nvortex	i meant wait
2016-05-08 15:50:01	@Espyo	if somebody foreign wanted to translate it, they'd probably have to put spaces
2016-05-08 15:50:08	@Espyo	waith, nice
2016-05-08 15:50:14	@Espyo	right, thought so
2016-05-08 15:50:38	Nvortex	the fact that the english name is /waterwraith/ 
2016-05-08 15:50:48	Nvortex	they translated the bouzu part
2016-05-08 15:50:56	Nvortex	and possibly the amoeba part too
2016-05-08 15:51:36	Nvortex	i know you don't add spaces, i was trying to get the meaning of each letter
2016-05-08 15:51:44	Nvortex	and realized that it ould be a pun
2016-05-08 15:52:27	Nvortex	the ame part is present in both the waterwrait and plasm wraith (and mysterious life form)
2016-05-08 15:53:24	Nvortex	but ame doesn't mean rain in the plasm wraith
2016-05-08 15:53:29	Nvortex	it makes more sense to think it means candy
2016-05-08 15:53:53	@Espyo	I guess...
2016-05-08 15:53:57	@Espyo	what do you guys think?
2016-05-08 15:54:30	Marty2000	Candy... maybe
2016-05-08 15:56:33	Nvortex	irght now i think the ame part does not refer to amoeba but to candy and that the bouzu and nyuudou refer to the religious titles and the monster for the waterwraith (i don't know about the monster part of the plasm wraith)
2016-05-08 15:57:27	@Espyo	yeah
2016-05-08 15:57:51	Nvortex	but the myesterious life form doesnt look like candy at all...
2016-05-08 15:57:59	Nvortex	and that one looks more like an amoeba
2016-05-08 15:58:07	Nvortex	and it shares the same name with the wraith
2016-05-08 15:58:19	@Espyo	kinda looks like candy
2016-05-08 15:58:33	@Espyo	well, when it's in its opaque form
2016-05-08 15:59:18	Nvortex	oh yeah
2016-05-08 16:06:53	Nvortex	the waterwraith name could refer to amoeba and candy but not the plasm wraith
2016-05-08 16:06:59	Nvortex	ameb
2016-05-08 16:07:26	Nvortex	the plasm wraith doesn't because it follows with an n
2016-05-08 16:07:28	Nvortex	amen
2016-05-08 16:07:50	Nvortex	and the mysterious life form shares the name with the waterwraith and that one does look like an amoeba
2016-05-08 16:09:12	@Espyo	hm, yeah

2016-05-08 18:31:50	Marty2000	Lol
2016-05-08 18:32:18	Marty2000	It's just me, but I don't think we should add the sequel is Pikmin 4
2016-05-08 18:32:44	Marty2000	Maybe it should be added, but in my opinion, it shouldn't... we don't even know if it's going to be called Pikmin 4
2016-05-08 18:32:57	Marty2000	It will probably be, but it's just a supposition
2016-05-08 18:33:01	Marty2000	We're not certain
2016-05-08 18:35:41	Marty2000	Ah well, I see it was reverted

2016-05-08 18:42:28	Marty2000	Someon put "sequel : Pikmin 4" in the Pikmin 3 article
2016-05-08 18:42:35	Marty2000	Of course we'll need an article
2016-05-08 18:42:43	Nvortex	ok
2016-05-08 18:44:11	@Espyo	exactly
2016-05-08 18:44:16	@Espyo	it could be Pikmin's Big Fishing Adventure
2016-05-08 18:44:23	@Espyo	it could be a canceled game
2016-05-08 18:44:28	@Espyo	it could be Pikmin 0, a prequel
2016-05-08 18:44:40	@Espyo	we HAVE the article, Nv

2016-05-08 21:23:50	UltraMario	:>
2016-05-08 21:33:26	@Espyo	oh, this is Smash FOUR
2016-05-08 21:33:32	@Espyo	I thought you were doing Brawl hacking
2016-05-08 21:33:35	@Espyo	nice
2016-05-08 21:33:36	@Espyo	was it easy?
2016-05-08 21:33:40	Marty2000	Yes
2016-05-08 21:33:43	Marty2000	Very
2016-05-08 21:33:51	@Espyo	wow
2016-05-08 21:33:53	@Espyo	that's reassuring
2016-05-08 21:33:57	@Espyo	I want to jump in on the train as well
2016-05-08 21:33:57	@Espyo	...
2016-05-08 21:34:02	Marty2000	Takes a couple of minutes
2016-05-08 21:34:03	@Espyo	but I'm afraid a new update might destroy everything
2016-05-08 21:34:10	@Espyo	plus Nintendo is very likely keeping their eyes peeled for this
2016-05-08 21:34:12	Marty2000	There's a way to block updaes
2016-05-08 21:34:15	Marty2000	dates*
2016-05-08 21:34:19	@Espyo	I can imagine punishment for those that try to do this
2016-05-08 21:34:31	Marty2000	Yes...
2016-05-08 21:34:32	@Espyo	well yeah, but what if they block you out of a new game unless you have version X of the firmware?
2016-05-08 21:34:44	Marty2000	Wait, I'll ask UltraMario
2016-05-08 21:34:44	@Espyo	Wii hacking was easy for me because I joined the Wii scene late into its lifetime
2016-05-08 21:34:48	@Espyo	so I just hacked without caring
2016-05-08 21:34:52	Marty2000	Same
2016-05-08 21:34:53	@Espyo	but here... I'll be a little more cautious
2016-05-08 21:34:58	@Espyo	as much as I DEFINITELY want to jump in
2016-05-08 21:35:07	@Espyo	hmm...
2016-05-08 21:35:14	@Espyo	can't you use this to hack Pikmin 3, though?
2016-05-08 21:35:22	Marty2000	I don't know
2016-05-08 21:35:31	@Espyo	it should be the same process
2016-05-08 21:35:34	@Espyo	btw, I'm gonna go on Splatoon
2016-05-08 21:35:36	Marty2000	But it seems it can be used for Splatoon (play as an Octoling)
2016-05-08 21:35:40	Marty2000	Okay
2016-05-08 21:35:43	@Espyo	if you can join me with that equipment, I'd like that
2016-05-08 21:35:49	Marty2000	May I join? I'll wear the cloth you wanted

2016-05-08 21:36:38	@Espyo	by the way... it's not very normal to call an individual item a "cloth"
2016-05-08 21:36:49	@Espyo	a cloth is normally like a small towel
2016-05-08 21:36:57	@Espyo	normally, you use "piece of clothing"
2016-05-08 21:36:59	Marty2000	Piece of clothing
2016-05-08 21:37:27	Marty2000	Yes, I know it but I always make the mistake when speaking too quickly. Sorry, I'm always trying to rememeber

2016-05-08 21:39:19	Marty2000	By the way, Turf Wars or Ranked Battles? I don't know what the current rules are
2016-05-08 21:39:20	@Espyo	the more you speak or write English, the better you get at it
2016-05-08 21:39:22	@Espyo	it's just the way it is
2016-05-08 21:39:26	@Espyo	even I learn all the time
2016-05-08 21:39:31	@Espyo	and I'd consider myself almost native-level
2016-05-08 21:39:40	@Espyo	oh, simple Turf will do
2016-05-08 21:39:46	@Espyo	PikFan's also playing right now
2016-05-08 21:39:56	Marty2000	True... I could barely speak English 2 years ago
2016-05-08 21:40:14	Marty2000	But I could really learn a lot of things by playing Animal Crossing
2016-05-08 21:40:16	@Espyo	hehe, well there you go
2016-05-08 21:40:23	@Espyo	yes, it has so much text...
2016-05-08 21:40:27	Marty2000	I met a Japanese player online, and we became great friends
2016-05-08 21:40:34	Marty2000	And she could speak English
2016-05-08 21:40:41	Marty2000	Well, at the beginning I had to use translators
2016-05-08 21:40:52	Marty2000	But now, I can get what she says and I can talk with her
2016-05-08 21:41:18	Marty2000	It's funny, by the way, that I learnt some English thanks to a Japanese person
2016-05-08 21:42:57	Marty2000	Ah, by the way, once we have finished our match, you'll have to quit and look for my Inkling in the plaza
2016-05-08 21:43:12	UltraMario	hey marty,  question
2016-05-08 21:43:16	Marty2000	Yep
