2015-07-16 21:25:45	@PikFan	hi
2015-07-16 21:26:25	@PikFan	so there's this article from The New Yorker that predicts imminent doom for my area
2015-07-16 21:26:26	@PikFan	http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one
2015-07-16 21:33:32	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-16 21:35:08	@Espyo	>Oh, shit, Goldfinger thought, although not in dread, at first: in amazement.
2015-07-16 21:35:08	Testyo	You swear like a sailor.
2015-07-16 21:35:14	@Espyo	this looks like a totally credible news source
2015-07-16 21:35:57	@PikFan	they have been predicting a big earthquake for some time now
2015-07-16 21:38:18	@J	it reads like a credible news source to me
2015-07-16 21:38:26	@J	surprisingly well written for something on the internet
2015-07-16 21:38:32	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-16 21:38:49	@Espyo	but I didn't really expect it to just have "Oh, shit", without it being a quote
2015-07-16 21:38:49	Testyo	Are you sure you needed to swear?
2015-07-16 21:38:55	@Espyo	just seems like an "whatever" news source
2015-07-16 21:39:07	@Espyo	...I bet even clickbaity at times
2015-07-16 21:39:31	@PikFan	well, people on social media are all over it
2015-07-16 21:39:36	@PikFan	at least it's getting attention
2015-07-16 21:39:44	@PikFan	not many people know this kind of threat
2015-07-16 21:39:49	@Espyo	so so so many disaster predictions get spread on social media
2015-07-16 21:39:52	@Espyo	sure, some can be true
2015-07-16 21:40:04	@Espyo	but for the most part, it either isn't, or it's several times less important than what people make it out to be
2015-07-16 21:40:18	Yoshi2	yup
2015-07-16 21:40:50	@PikFan	I feel like you're trying to destroy the purpose of the article
2015-07-16 21:41:19	Yoshi2	what purpose is it that espyo is trying to destroy?
2015-07-16 21:41:20	@Espyo	kinda...?
2015-07-16 21:42:31	@PikFan	you adults and your need to disagree with everything
2015-07-16 21:43:01	@Espyo	our life practice
2015-07-16 21:43:12	@Espyo	dat dang there social media is no right, I tell you what
2015-07-16 21:43:21	Yoshi2	ya need to be a bit more critical of stuff
2015-07-16 21:45:24	@PikFan	it's really long
2015-07-16 21:45:41	@PikFan	I read most of it, and it was pretty in-depth
2015-07-16 21:45:55	@PikFan	so I'm not sure why you're saying it's bogus
2015-07-16 21:46:10	@PikFan	other than the quote thing
2015-07-16 21:46:27	@Espyo	well, it still seems blown a bit out of proportion
2015-07-16 21:46:42	@PikFan	...are you supposed to use quotes when referring to thoughts?
2015-07-16 21:46:56	@PikFan	"I'm going to eat pizza," he though
2015-07-16 21:46:58	@PikFan	*thought
2015-07-16 21:47:43	@Espyo	that's not so much the point
2015-07-16 21:47:48	@PikFan	well, look what happened to Japan
2015-07-16 21:47:51	@Espyo	like, why would a news source be saying shit?
2015-07-16 21:47:52	Testyo	You're using quite the colorful words, aren't you?
2015-07-16 21:48:06	@Espyo	are they journalists or the gossiper drunk guy at the bar?
2015-07-16 21:50:20	Yoshi2	the author says a lot, but a lot of it feels like fluff
2015-07-16 21:52:10	@PikFan	bleh, fine
2015-07-16 21:58:21	@PikFan	but again, look what happened to Japan
2015-07-16 21:58:31	@PikFan	it was devastated
2015-07-16 21:58:46	@PikFan	and you're trying to tell me that my region wouldn't be devastated?
2015-07-16 21:58:53	@PikFan	I don't think it's fluff
2015-07-16 21:59:03	@PikFan	or blown out of proportion
2015-07-16 21:59:12	@PikFan	earthquakes are very powerful
2015-07-16 21:59:49	@PikFan	if you want to believe it's bogus, then fine, but I don't think it is
2015-07-16 22:00:22	@PikFan	it's just describing what would happen in very intricate detail
2015-07-16 22:00:55	Yoshi2	I'm not saying that all of it is fluff, but some of the content seems not very necessary when all it's saying is that the area will be hit hard and there are no plans for what to do in emergency
2015-07-16 22:01:50	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-16 22:02:16	@PikFan	you mean like the Lewis and Clark expedition bit?
2015-07-16 22:03:04	Yoshi2	a part of the text is about stuff happening in 1700 or something
2015-07-16 22:03:31	@PikFan	it's still relevant
2015-07-16 22:03:46	@PikFan	there was a big earthquake around then too
2015-07-16 22:03:58	@PikFan	it's just laying out the evidence
2015-07-16 22:06:38	Yoshi2	well, it's definitely evidence that earthquakes can happen in the area
2015-07-16 22:10:44	Yoshi2	well, it very well can happen and be really strong, so it is best to prepare for the worst
2015-07-16 22:11:05	Yoshi2	Japan seems to be accustomed to earthquakes so they have an easier time dealing with those
2015-07-16 22:11:19	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-16 22:11:41	@PikFan	but even they weren't ready for a 9.0
2015-07-16 22:11:46	@PikFan	they didn't think it could happen
2015-07-16 22:12:11	@PikFan	there was one scientist who tried to warn the government
2015-07-16 22:12:17	@PikFan	they just laughed at him
2015-07-16 22:12:30	Yoshi2	really? Haven't heard of that
2015-07-16 22:12:52	Yoshi2	and the government is very big
2015-07-16 22:13:04	Yoshi2	so he'd be talking to a part of it
2015-07-16 22:14:11	@PikFan	oops, I remembered it wrong
2015-07-16 22:14:18	@PikFan	not the government
2015-07-16 22:14:23	@PikFan	it was a presentation
2015-07-16 22:14:28	@PikFan	but people ignored it
2015-07-16 22:14:45	@PikFan	"In 2005, however, at a conference in Hokudan, a Japanese geologist named Yasutaka Ikeda had argued that the nation should expect a magnitude 9.0 in the near future—with catastrophic consequences, because Japan’s famous earthquake-and-tsunami preparedness, including the height of its sea walls, was based on incorrect science. The presentation was met with
2015-07-16 22:14:48	@PikFan	polite applause and thereafter largely ignored. Now, Goldfinger realized as the shaking hit the four-minute mark, the planet was proving the Japanese Cassandra right."
2015-07-16 22:15:08	@PikFan	...Japanese Cassandra?

2015-07-16 23:49:27	@Espyo	wow
2015-07-16 23:49:38	@Espyo	so Pikmin 3 has a glitch where you can cancel the pluck midway through the plucking animation
2015-07-16 23:49:41	@Espyo	and it cancels the pluck altogether
2015-07-16 23:49:47	@Espyo	so you don't have to wait for the animation to go to the next pluck
2015-07-16 23:49:58	@Espyo	I managed to recreate that glitch on the engine
2015-07-16 23:50:00	@Espyo	without even trying

2015-07-16 23:50:44	@Espyo	I just did
2015-07-16 23:51:03	@Espyo	I made it so that when the leader gets near the Pikmin they want to pluck
2015-07-16 23:51:06	@Espyo	the Pikmin's pluck animation begins
2015-07-16 23:51:19	@Espyo	and the leader and the Pikmin are independent at this point
2015-07-16 23:51:29	@Espyo	the Pikmin goes through its animation and only joins the group after
2015-07-16 23:51:35	@Espyo	but the leader can cancel their animation
2015-07-16 23:51:38	@Espyo	this is all intended behavior
2015-07-16 23:51:47	@Espyo	but canceling into a new pluck? that's just a consequence of it all
2015-07-16 23:51:51	@Espyo	so it's more like an exploit
2015-07-16 23:51:59	@Espyo	but I wasn't aiming to make it work THIS close to Pikmin 3
2015-07-16 23:52:02	@PikFan	http://www.pikminfanon.com/Pikmin_V#Miscellaneous_changes
2015-07-16 23:52:05	@PikFan	"Pluck cancelling no longer exists because it defies physics and logic."
2015-07-16 23:52:08	@Espyo	just goes to show that sometimes, programming logic is just...
2015-07-16 23:52:15	@Espyo	I can't even describe it
2015-07-16 23:52:16	@Espyo	hah!
2015-07-16 23:52:19	@Espyo	@link
2015-07-16 23:52:31	@Espyo	[[Pluck#Strategy]]
2015-07-16 23:52:32	Testyo	"Pluck#Strategy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Pluck#Strategy
2015-07-16 23:52:33	@Espyo	I think that link works
2015-07-16 23:52:45	@PikFan	I wonder how old En Passant is
2015-07-16 23:53:07	@Espyo	I think he works, so...
2015-07-16 23:53:17	@PikFan	for a "minor" he has quite the detail
2015-07-16 23:53:41	@PikFan	I still want to detail the menus and whatnot of my game
2015-07-16 23:53:54	@Espyo	you should
2015-07-16 23:54:07	@PikFan	like, for the end of day in P3, I was disappointed that they lumped together all the deaths
2015-07-16 23:54:22	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-16 23:54:27	@PikFan	but I was glad that they brought back the chart from P1
2015-07-16 23:54:59	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-16 23:55:07	@Espyo	I suppose they just prefer to simplify it
2015-07-16 23:55:27	@PikFan	imo, the ideal results would have that chart, how many of each Pikmin (and total) were born that day, and how many Pikmin died, both total and for specific hazards

2015-07-16 23:57:17	@Espyo	hm?
2015-07-16 23:57:19	@PikFan	I had some other details
2015-07-16 23:57:21	@PikFan	so
2015-07-16 23:57:41	@PikFan	Red Pikmin will not be resistant to lava, because lava = liquid = not breathing = drowning
2015-07-16 23:57:59	@PikFan	and right now Cyan Pikmin are resistant to cold things, but also water
2015-07-16 23:58:04	@PikFan	should be just cold things
2015-07-16 23:58:10	@PikFan	because again, of the drowning
2015-07-16 23:58:18	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2015-07-16 23:58:34	@PikFan	anyway, I wanted to point that out real quick

2015-07-17 19:59:18	@J	hi
2015-07-17 20:01:55	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-17 20:03:54	Yoshi2	hiho Testyo & Espyo 
2015-07-17 20:03:55	Testyo	I'm sure I recognise the limit shouldn't be that big
2015-07-17 20:04:03	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-17 20:17:35	Yoshi2	there is a lot to do on wikis even if you don't have content to add
2015-07-17 20:17:43	@Espyo	there sure is
2015-07-17 20:18:07	Kazooie	like fixing tonnes of redirect links
2015-07-17 20:19:07	@Espyo	well, that one's not so important
2015-07-17 20:19:45	@Espyo	having [[Skitter Leaves]] instead of [[Skitter Leaf|Skitter Leaves]] is easier to read
2015-07-17 20:19:46	Testyo	"Skitter_Leaves" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Skitter_Leaves
2015-07-17 20:19:53	@Espyo	and has no real impact on the reader whichever way you pick
2015-07-17 20:21:25	Kazooie	but I mean things that are actually bad links
2015-07-17 20:21:42	Kazooie	say you change a policy on naming conventions of a group of articles
2015-07-17 20:22:01	@Espyo	well yeah, that's important
2015-07-17 20:22:02	Kazooie	then those need to be fixed
2015-07-17 20:22:06	Kazooie	like on the mario wiki
2015-07-17 20:22:26	Kazooie	they /just/ decided that 'oh hey look calling it beta elements is bad, whoops'
2015-07-17 20:23:59	Kazooie	so now every article that was named 'List of [game name] beta elements' is called 'List of [game name] pre-release and unused content'
2015-07-17 20:25:16	@Espyo	wha?!
2015-07-17 20:25:20	@Espyo	they actually did it?
2015-07-17 20:25:20	Kazooie	yes
2015-07-17 20:25:22	Kazooie	yes
2015-07-17 20:25:25	Kazooie	they actually did it
2015-07-17 20:25:26	@Espyo	only took them like, what, 6 years?
2015-07-17 20:25:33	Kazooie	9
2015-07-17 20:25:36	@Espyo	good grief
2015-07-17 20:25:38	Kazooie	shameful
2015-07-17 20:25:48	@Espyo	they shouldn't combine prerelease with unused content, but hey, it's a step in the right direction, at least
2015-07-17 20:25:55	Kazooie	yeah
2015-07-17 20:26:24	Kazooie	right now every article is like ==pre-release== [insert pre-release here] ==unused== [insert unused here]
2015-07-17 20:26:38	Kazooie	but yeah, it's a step in the right direction
2015-07-17 20:26:48	@Espyo	it's gonna look weird
2015-07-17 20:26:49	@Espyo	but oh well
2015-07-17 20:26:52	Kazooie	i agree
2015-07-17 20:26:55	@Espyo	it might actually work out okay
2015-07-17 20:27:00	Kazooie	it's better to not have endless sub-sections
2015-07-17 20:27:00	@Espyo	because, in a way, unused content IS prerelease info
2015-07-17 20:27:04	Kazooie	mhm
2015-07-17 21:19:08	@J	Espyo: http://www.twitch.tv/hxlexie some technical game development-type stuff you might find interesting
2015-07-17 21:19:20	@J	it was procedural generation stuff for a while, I don't know, he might go back to that

2015-07-17 21:19:27	@Espyo	thanks

2015-07-17 21:35:07	@Espyo	loving these 1 frame per 3 seconds framerate
2015-07-17 21:35:13	@Espyo	is it just my machine?
2015-07-17 21:37:23	@J	fine for me
2015-07-17 21:37:45	@J	is audio fine?
2015-07-17 21:37:49	@Espyo	audio is fine
2015-07-17 21:37:54	@Espyo	I WAS loading skype just now because it decided it should've died
2015-07-17 21:38:04	@Espyo	and skype can take up to 2 minutes before it frees system resources, after loading
2015-07-17 21:38:08	@Espyo	but even now it's pretty horrible
2015-07-17 21:38:14	@Espyo	 3fps, more or less
2015-07-17 21:38:17	@J	actually looks like 60FPS, but I think the webcam is 30
2015-07-17 21:38:29	@J	to be fair I'm using VLC
2015-07-17 21:38:30	@Espyo	I've been watching for a while and I still don't know what he's doing because of the framerate
2015-07-17 21:39:12	@Espyo	I'll give VLC a try
2015-07-17 21:39:20	@Espyo	can I just slap the URL tou gave me?
2015-07-17 21:39:22	@Espyo	*y
2015-07-17 21:39:26	@J	not at all
2015-07-17 21:39:46	@J	I'm using a command-line application called livestreamer to do it
2015-07-17 21:40:04	@Espyo	hm
2015-07-17 21:40:12	@Espyo	I know VLC can stream natively just fine, though
2015-07-17 21:40:37	@Espyo	yeah, I can't watch this
2015-07-17 21:40:45	@Espyo	it's not capturing much of my interest in and of itself
2015-07-17 21:40:48	@J	it works fine for me on the page too
2015-07-17 21:40:49	@Espyo	mostly assets, at least at the moment
2015-07-17 21:40:52	@Espyo	I could shrug less at it
2015-07-17 21:40:54	@J	yeah
2015-07-17 21:41:05	@J	no
2015-07-17 21:41:07	@Espyo	but combine that with flash being broken lately, and my machine just wanting to die today
2015-07-17 21:41:08	@J	you can't
2015-07-17 21:41:09	@Espyo	I just... I just can't
2015-07-17 21:41:14	@J	you can't say 'could shrug'
2015-07-17 21:41:17	@J	really?
2015-07-17 21:41:23	@Espyo	I totally can say that
2015-07-17 21:41:25	@Espyo	I can shrug
2015-07-17 21:41:28	@Espyo	I can raise my shoulders
2015-07-17 21:41:31	@Espyo	I'm raising them high at this
2015-07-17 21:41:33	@Espyo	I could raise them less high
2015-07-17 21:41:44	@J	but
2015-07-17 21:41:44	@J	wait
2015-07-17 21:41:47	@J	I'm so confused
2015-07-17 21:41:57	@J	also I don't think that's even a phrase
2015-07-17 21:41:58	@Espyo	you know when you don't care about something
2015-07-17 21:41:58	@Espyo	you shrug
2015-07-17 21:42:11	@Espyo	you can say "I could X less" to a lot of things if you try
2015-07-17 21:42:19	@J	yeah, that's the point
2015-07-17 21:42:19	@Espyo	"I could sleep less"
2015-07-17 21:42:26	@Espyo	well, I could shrug less
2015-07-17 21:42:31	@J	it's "couldn't care less", not "could care less"
2015-07-17 21:42:32	@Espyo	trust me, there's logic in there
2015-07-17 21:42:41	@Espyo	but that's just it
2015-07-17 21:42:47	@Espyo	caring is the opposite of shrugging
2015-07-17 21:42:51	@Espyo	(for this context)
2015-07-17 21:43:00	@J	I'm still confused
2015-07-17 21:43:08	@Espyo	just take the sentence for what it is
2015-07-17 21:43:11	@J	sure
2015-07-17 21:43:12	@Espyo	I'm shrugging at the video
2015-07-17 21:43:15	@Espyo	well, stream
2015-07-17 21:43:17	@Espyo	I could shrug less
2015-07-17 21:43:18	@J	just constantly
2015-07-17 21:43:21	@Espyo	I could give a smaller shrug
2015-07-17 21:43:21	@J	that's an image
2015-07-17 21:43:26	@Espyo	but I won't, because I give a large shrug
2015-07-17 21:43:29	@Espyo	because it's not interesting me
2015-07-17 21:44:03	@J	okay, stop shrugging, you'll tire out your shoulders
2015-07-17 21:44:13	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-17 21:44:20	@Espyo	though I guess it is good workout
2015-07-17 21:44:20	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-07-17 21:44:34	@J	anyway, there was a crazy thing
2015-07-17 21:44:53	@J	they're using a 2D physics engine to procedurally determine room layouts
2015-07-17 21:45:43	@Espyo	whaa?
2015-07-17 21:45:50	@J	it looks like loads of shapes connected by ropes, then the ropes contract to bring the rooms together
2015-07-17 21:47:13	@Espyo	oh wow
2015-07-17 21:50:31	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwDUiCzPVU&feature=youtu.be so I stumbled upon this on reddit
2015-07-17 21:50:38	@Espyo	and remember how sad it was that I didn't see much of AGDQ 2014
2015-07-17 21:50:47	@Espyo	and then how sad it will be that I won't be able to see much of SGDQ 2015
2015-07-17 21:50:59	@Espyo	*AGDQ 2105
2015-07-17 21:51:02	@Espyo	...*2015
2015-07-17 22:11:21	Kazooie	but
2015-07-17 22:11:30	Kazooie	AGDQ 2015 has already been
2015-07-17 22:14:48	@Espyo	that was correcting the first sentence
2015-07-17 22:14:58	@Espyo	err, second, or third if you skip the "oh wow"
2015-07-17 22:35:24	Kazooie	ah
2015-07-17 22:35:26	Kazooie	okay
2015-07-17 22:35:31	Kazooie	I was confused there for a little
2015-07-17 22:35:52	@Espyo	I knew that'd happen... :|
2015-07-17 22:38:26	Kazooie	:|
2015-07-17 23:11:33	@Espyo	Pikmin 2 mystery of the day
2015-07-17 23:11:44	@Espyo	there are some text files that list the songs to use on every cave's sublevel
2015-07-17 23:11:50	@Espyo	except they can't be used
2015-07-17 23:11:53	@Espyo	because they don't match up
2015-07-17 23:12:03	Kazooie	what
2015-07-17 23:12:15	@Espyo	like, the US version of Pikmin 2 says the second level of the Emergence Cave (a snowy cave, as a reminder) uses a metallic cave song
2015-07-17 23:12:18	@Espyo	and we know that that's not true
2015-07-17 23:12:28	@Espyo	so it's obvious that it's not getting the music info off of THAT file
2015-07-17 23:12:34	@Espyo	so I replace the file with garbage
2015-07-17 23:12:35	@Espyo	and it refuses to load
2015-07-17 23:12:41	@Espyo	meaning it IS loading from that file
2015-07-17 23:12:42	@Espyo	I can't even
2015-07-17 23:13:13	Kazooie	are you sure about this
2015-07-17 23:13:15	Yoshi2	oOoO
2015-07-17 23:13:18	Kazooie	like
2015-07-17 23:13:26	Kazooie	are you sure about the labelling of these
2015-07-17 23:14:02	@Espyo	I'm not sure about anything any more
2015-07-17 23:14:11	@Espyo	there are never any certainties when messing with Pikmin 2's files
2015-07-17 23:14:13	@Espyo	there just aren't
2015-07-17 23:14:19	Kazooie	things just /are/
2015-07-17 23:14:34	@Espyo	also Yoshi2: Scruffy on the wiki wrote about how the cave songs in Pikmin 2 are RANDOMLY GENERATED
2015-07-17 23:14:49	Kazooie	what
2015-07-17 23:14:53	Kazooie	Pikmin 2
2015-07-17 23:14:53	@Espyo	so I'd be surprise if the .bms files are even a normal sequenced song file to begin with
2015-07-17 23:14:59	Kazooie	Pikmin 2 what are you doing
2015-07-17 23:15:05	@Espyo	*I'd be surprised
2015-07-17 23:15:22	@Espyo	plus, while trying to look through the files, when I found out this fiasco with the game crashing
2015-07-17 23:15:29	@Espyo	I learned that it uses a LOT of files to control its music
2015-07-17 23:15:43	@Espyo	"conditions" seems to be a word tossed around a lot throughout the game's internals
2015-07-17 23:15:51	Yoshi2	Espyo: one thing is sure, the bms files are far more than what it seems on the first sight
2015-07-17 23:16:01	@Espyo	very much so
2015-07-17 23:16:39	Yoshi2	but eventually I'll be finished with pep8ifying the bms code, and I'll try to parse the remaining few files
2015-07-17 23:16:51	@Espyo	good luck...
2015-07-17 23:16:56	Yoshi2	well
2015-07-17 23:16:58	@Espyo	you're going to need it... and a whole lot more
2015-07-17 23:17:35	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Music (Pikmin Adventure) by Scruffy (+3772 Finished bosses.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Music_(Pikmin_Adventure)&curid=19169&diff=151989&oldid=151976
2015-07-17 23:18:10	@Espyo	speaking of...
2015-07-17 23:20:53	Yoshi2	I'll definitely try to parse the files as a single-track file to see if they contain recognizable sounds
2015-07-17 23:22:00	Yoshi2	anything more than that requires information that I do not have yet
2015-07-17 23:23:00	Yoshi2	which reminds me, I wonder what the SMS guy has been up to lately
2015-07-17 23:25:21	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-17 23:25:22	Kazooie	what SMS guy?
2015-07-17 23:25:31	Kazooie	in my mind, SMS = Super Mario Sunshine
2015-07-17 23:25:59	Yoshi2	Kazooie: and you are right
2015-07-17 23:26:19	Yoshi2	because the guy I'm referring to does reverse-engineering in super mario sunshine
2015-07-17 23:26:29	Kazooie	oh wow
2015-07-17 23:30:01	Yoshi2	Espyo: wait what, dolphin can do disassembly output?
2015-07-17 23:30:34	@Espyo	pretty sure it can
2015-07-17 23:30:39	Yoshi2	I wonder if that could be useful in any way with the pikmin stuff
2015-07-17 23:30:52	@Espyo	if you can read machine code, it would be helpful for everything, everywhere
2015-07-17 23:30:58	@Espyo	well, if you can read machine code AND have months to spare
2015-07-17 23:31:08	Yoshi2	wellp
2015-07-17 23:31:22	@Espyo	it outputs the most atomic instructions possible
2015-07-17 23:31:26	Yoshi2	I can't read it and don't have months to spare :V
2015-07-17 23:31:39	@Espyo	like, machine code is hardly code anyway
2015-07-17 23:31:41	@Espyo	it's just raw instructions
2015-07-17 23:31:52	@Espyo	move the byte on this address to this address
2015-07-17 23:31:53	Yoshi2	if I had months to spare, I'd try to decipher it
2015-07-17 23:31:57	@Espyo	sum the value on that other address
2015-07-17 23:32:10	@Espyo	and yet, people can sometimes discover things
2015-07-17 23:32:25	@Espyo	like, one guy discovered a whole bunch of debug menus in Beyond Oasis via disassembly
2015-07-17 23:32:30	@Espyo	well, it's a Mega Drive game, so it's easier
2015-07-17 23:32:45	@Espyo	but the game is so obscure that the guy spent months of his life on it
2015-07-17 23:32:53	@Espyo	so maybe it's not THAT hard
2015-07-17 23:33:01	@Espyo	but... I'd bet it's still pretty impossibly hard
2015-07-17 23:34:11	Yoshi2	so much for that idea
2015-07-17 23:34:22	Yoshi2	I'll just make do with that arookas came up with
2015-07-17 23:34:31	Yoshi2	which is a lot
2015-07-17 23:34:46	Yoshi2	https://github.com/arookas/Sunshine/tree/master/jengine that guy is pretty damn awesome
2015-07-17 23:35:14	@Espyo	huh? what's this?
2015-07-17 23:35:16	Yoshi2	if he used disassembly, how did he manage to decipher it into C++ code?
2015-07-17 23:35:35	Yoshi2	"This repository holds a work-in-progress, reverse-engineering conversion of Super Mario Sunshine's code."
2015-07-17 23:35:48	@Espyo	hmmm
2015-07-17 23:35:53	@Espyo	could've been handmade
2015-07-17 23:36:04	@Espyo	maybe the game has debugging symbols inside of it
2015-07-17 23:37:25	Yoshi2	well, whatever it is, the result looks good
2015-07-17 23:38:42	Yoshi2	I'll be taking a nap now, good night o/

2015-07-18 14:40:34	Yoshi2	>.>
2015-07-18 14:42:17	Yoshi2	Espyo: why does the "who is" function work like that?
2015-07-18 14:42:28	@Espyo	wrong question
2015-07-18 14:42:32	@Espyo	"why not?"
2015-07-18 14:43:28	Yoshi2	Testyo: why not?
2015-07-18 14:43:28	Testyo	yeah, a 23-person voice chat doesn't sound like it meant to be std::max using algorithm?
2015-07-18 14:46:03	Yoshi2	like, what was the motivation behind it
2015-07-18 14:46:21	@Espyo	just one of his dozens of random features
2015-07-18 14:46:34	@Espyo	most of the motivation behind Testyo as a whole to begin with
2015-07-18 14:46:35	Testyo	well, J said that it sounds like something he said so I guess that must be it should eat prey
2015-07-18 14:46:48	@Espyo	was that there was a bot on an IRC channel me and some friends went to
2015-07-18 14:46:52	@Espyo	and it did a lot of random stuff
2015-07-18 14:47:03	@Espyo	I can't remember any of it except for this one feature I recreated on Testyo:
2015-07-18 14:47:04	Testyo	I mean, there are even larger examples of products that _do_ compete - practically every office suite supported MS Office formats before they were open specifications
2015-07-18 14:47:05	@Espyo	Testyo: describe me
2015-07-18 14:47:06	Testyo	Espyo, you are a level 42 Emo Poltergeist, and your special power is: Withstanding intense heat!
2015-07-18 14:47:25	@Espyo	so that's why I made Testyo, to bring those dumb features back to life
2015-07-18 14:47:26	Testyo	I give a pretty good estimate of when he's coming back
2015-07-18 14:47:32	@Espyo	so I started expanding from there
2015-07-18 14:47:40	@Espyo	and I think the "who is" feature also existed in the other bot
2015-07-18 14:47:48	@Espyo	it's useful for stuff like
2015-07-18 14:48:01	@Espyo	Testyo: who's responsible for NWiki's death?
2015-07-18 14:48:02	Testyo	No one's responsible for NWiki's death.
2015-07-18 14:48:07	@Espyo	well then
2015-07-18 14:49:01	Yoshi2	Testyo: who's responsible for 9/11?
2015-07-18 14:49:02	Testyo	Testyo's responsible for 9/11.
2015-07-18 14:49:06	Yoshi2	knew it
2015-07-18 14:49:48	Yoshi2	that does make sense
2015-07-18 14:50:11	Yoshi2	quite a lot of random stuff on bots can be very fun and yet easy to implement

2015-07-18 19:06:01	Yoshi2	and co.uk is for commercial stuff, similar to .com, like J said
2015-07-18 19:06:13	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.uk#Second-level_domains
2015-07-18 19:06:37	Yoshi2	well, commercial and general stuff
2015-07-18 19:06:41	Yoshi2	like .com
2015-07-18 19:07:22	Yoshi2	has nothing to do with commonwealth, the commonwealth countries should have their own top level domains

2015-07-18 20:14:14	@J	based?
2015-07-18 20:15:21	Pi	hang on
2015-07-18 20:15:59	Pi	like the meaning isn't even clear anymore
2015-07-18 20:16:24	Pi	I just use it as a way to say 'extra thanks', which is what it meant in this context
2015-07-18 20:16:36	@J	...sure
2015-07-18 20:16:57	@J	it sounds like you're saying Testyo is based on thankfulness

2015-07-18 20:17:26	Pi	http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Based this is the based I'm talking about
2015-07-18 20:18:23	Yoshi2	so basically, based is used to show that somebody is pretty damn cool
2015-07-18 20:18:29	@J	okay, maybe I saw this used before but I just assumed people misspelled 'biased' or something
2015-07-18 20:18:39	@J	because I've seen it so rarely
2015-07-18 20:18:56	Pi	that was the best explanation of it ever, Yoshi2

2015-07-21 19:43:20	@Espyo	Hello, RH. I wanted to let you know that we have to remove some of your edits because they're too low quality. Most of the edits and articles you created aren't good, or do not have a purpose. For instance, your "Japanese" article is not useful because we have information on the Japanese words on the articles about the short movies themselves. Other Japanese texts don't make much sense to list on the article, because the Japanese version of all Pikmin game
2015-07-21 19:43:24	@Espyo	We don't want you to leave, but we do want you to please ask on the [[Pikipedia:Forums]] whenever you want to create an article. That way, if your idea for the article isn't good, we can tell you right away. If English is not your main language, let us know, too. ~~~~

2015-07-21 19:44:02	@PikFan	sure, yeah
2015-07-21 19:44:24	@Espyo	they might be Japanese themselves
2015-07-21 19:44:32	@Espyo	and if so... pretty good weapon to have on our arsenal
2015-07-21 19:44:36	@Espyo	so I don't want to scare anybody away
2015-07-21 19:44:43	@PikFan	>Other Japanese texts don't make much sense to list on the article, because the Japanese version of all Pikmin game
2015-07-21 19:44:49	@Espyo	but I do need to give a stern talking-to anywya

2015-07-21 19:44:49	@PikFan	random cutoff
2015-07-21 19:46:12	@Espyo	and you quoted that because?
2015-07-21 19:46:28	@PikFan	11:44	PikFan	random cutoff
2015-07-21 19:46:31	@Espyo	are you saying what I wrote cut off?
2015-07-21 19:46:48	@Espyo	because the Japanese version of all Pikmin games have their own text entirely in Japanese. So it would be pointless to have an article on that. All other texts, like the recycling symbol on the paper bags, are too small to have an article about them. If we do decide to have an article on all Japanese text, we'll do it in the future, but the way you created the article won't work well.
2015-07-21 19:46:54	@Espyo	there it is, if it cut off
2015-07-21 19:47:05	@PikFan	thanks
2015-07-21 19:48:16	@PikFan	oh, last night I updated [[f:PikminFanon:User access levels]]

2015-07-21 19:57:22	@Espyo	oh, so I MIGHT have found Pikmin 3's files yesterday
2015-07-21 19:57:26	@Espyo	but the torrent has no seeds
2015-07-21 19:58:29	Yoshi2	crap
2015-07-21 20:00:44	Yoshi2	with some luck, somebody will come online and seed it
2015-07-21 20:00:53	Yoshi2	with poor luck, nintendo will bust down your doors
2015-07-21 20:01:17	@PikFan	what does "the torrent has no seeds" mean?
2015-07-21 20:01:46	@Espyo	okay, torrents put simple:
2015-07-21 20:02:03	@Espyo	it's just a phone book entry that says "hey, this person has the Pikmin 3 files"
2015-07-21 20:02:07	@Espyo	other people check the phone book entry
2015-07-21 20:02:11	@Espyo	and connect to that person
2015-07-21 20:02:16	@Espyo	and start downloading the files
2015-07-21 20:02:22	@Espyo	then, when the download is complete
2015-07-21 20:02:26	@Espyo	they too belong to the phone book
2015-07-21 20:02:31	@Espyo	and other people can get from them too
2015-07-21 20:02:33	@Espyo	and so on and so forth
2015-07-21 20:02:44	@Espyo	the torrent really just is the list of people that own the file and can be connected to
2015-07-21 20:02:55	@Espyo	it's not quite; I'm not even so sure myself
2015-07-21 20:02:57	@Espyo	but it's more or less that
2015-07-21 20:03:02	@Espyo	anyway, a seed is somebody with the files
2015-07-21 20:03:06	@Espyo	no seeds = nobody with the files
2015-07-21 20:03:11	@Espyo	at least not online right now, anyway
2015-07-21 20:03:22	@Espyo	I might be grossly misinformed here or there about this
2015-07-21 20:03:28	@Espyo	I'm not really a master pirate >_>
2015-07-21 20:03:32	@Espyo	but that's the gist of it
2015-07-21 20:03:37	@PikFan	hmm
2015-07-21 20:03:49	@PikFan	does Nintendo own the torrent?
2015-07-21 20:04:11	Yoshi2	I remember torrent being a concept of distributed file sharing, not a phone book entry
2015-07-21 20:04:19	@Espyo	hahahahano
2015-07-21 20:04:28	@Espyo	well yeah, a torrent is a concept
2015-07-21 20:04:36	@J	yeah, you didn't say it was a metaphor
2015-07-21 20:04:39	@PikFan	because it sounds like what you're saying is that someone is notified whenever a new seed is added
2015-07-21 20:04:40	@Espyo	but each person's machine needs to know what other people own the file
2015-07-21 20:04:50	@Espyo	what if it isn't a metaphor
2015-07-21 20:04:55	@Espyo	you know phones are digital nowadays
2015-07-21 20:05:02	@Espyo	not quite like that
2015-07-21 20:05:03	Yoshi2	there are trackers and stuff
2015-07-21 20:05:06	@Espyo	it's so simple but so hard...
2015-07-21 20:05:31	@J	yeah, the torrent just has files, the set of users only exists through the connections between them
2015-07-21 20:05:39	Yoshi2	you are making it hard by saying that every person't machine needs to know who else owns the file
2015-07-21 20:05:40	@J	and they can find new users through other users, or through trackers
2015-07-21 20:05:53	Yoshi2	which is true but that makes understanding the concept a bit more difficult
2015-07-21 20:06:01	@J	there's also DHT, which is a thing I've heard of but don't understand
2015-07-21 20:06:15	@J	that helps peers find each other without a tracker somehow
2015-07-21 20:06:21	Yoshi2	yeah
2015-07-21 20:06:58	@J	also I should point out you don't have to be a 'master pirate' to understand or use torrents
2015-07-21 20:07:09	@Espyo	I know how to USE them
2015-07-21 20:07:12	@Espyo	just not how they work
2015-07-21 20:07:32	Yoshi2	yup, torrents are actually a great idea
2015-07-21 20:07:56	Yoshi2	distributed file sharing
2015-07-21 20:08:03	@PikFan	"In the BitTorrent file distribution system, a torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms."
2015-07-21 20:08:23	@PikFan	you never mentioned swarms
2015-07-21 20:08:31	@J	there aren't really enough sites using torrents outside of copyright infringement
2015-07-21 20:08:41	@Espyo	yeah, it's metadata
2015-07-21 20:08:46	@Espyo	but hey, I DID try to keep it simple
2015-07-21 20:08:46	@J	probably very large sites wouldn't pick them up because of their reputation
2015-07-21 20:08:59	Yoshi2	PikFan: that's just details
2015-07-21 20:09:04	@PikFan	I know
2015-07-21 20:09:28	Yoshi2	the gist of it is that with torrents, every user uploads and downloads the file at the same time
2015-07-21 20:10:11	Yoshi2	and if an user is finished downloading, he only uploads and is called a seeder
2015-07-21 20:11:30	Yoshi2	if there are no seeders, you will not be able to download the entire file
2015-07-21 20:12:08	Yoshi2	which is why Espyo is very, very sad now
2015-07-21 20:12:19	@Espyo	nope
2015-07-21 20:12:27	@Espyo	<Espyo> I might be grossly misinformed here or there about this
2015-07-21 20:12:31	@Espyo	I wrote my disclaimer
2015-07-21 20:12:33	@Espyo	no sadness here
2015-07-21 20:12:51	Yoshi2	no, I mean
2015-07-21 20:13:00	Yoshi2	[21:11:30] <Yoshi2> if there are no seeders, you will not be able to download the entire file
2015-07-21 20:13:12	Yoshi2	[20:57:22] <Espyo> oh, so I MIGHT have found Pikmin 3's files yesterday
2015-07-21 20:13:12	Yoshi2	[20:57:26] <Espyo> but the torrent has no seeds
2015-07-21 20:13:26	Yoshi2	you are clearly sad now
2015-07-21 20:13:42	@Espyo	well, about that part, yeah
2015-07-21 20:14:10	@PikFan	seeds should be called sprouts
2015-07-21 20:14:13	@PikFan	because Pikmin
2015-07-21 20:14:18	Yoshi2	heheehehhhe
2015-07-21 20:14:24	Yoshi2	puns are fun
2015-07-21 20:14:28	@PikFan	but seeds work too

2015-07-22 19:26:22	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-22 19:31:23	Yoshi2	hey Espyo & Testyo 
2015-07-22 19:31:24	Testyo	I wish sonic generatios had workshop compatability
2015-07-22 19:31:27	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-22 19:31:38	Yoshi2	that is a ruse
2015-07-22 19:31:40	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2015-07-22 19:31:40	Testyo	I said I wish sonic generatios had workshop compatability because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages i wish sonic generatios had workshop compatability and I think it happened on other websites. They were joined by the common word i.
2015-07-22 19:31:47	Yoshi2	yuuuuuuuuuuup
2015-07-22 19:39:48	@J	cheat
2015-07-22 19:41:08	Yoshi2	Espyo: is the pikmin 3 torrent still dead?
2015-07-22 19:41:28	@Espyo	I stopped trying
2015-07-22 19:41:32	@Espyo	I used an alternate place
2015-07-22 19:41:39	@Espyo	I found this forum with a download link on MEGA
2015-07-22 19:41:43	@Espyo	but the download link was hidden
2015-07-22 19:41:45	@Espyo	I needed an account
2015-07-22 19:41:46	@Espyo	so I made one
2015-07-22 19:41:49	@Espyo	but it was still hidden
2015-07-22 19:41:55	@Espyo	I needed to post a hell on the introduction board
2015-07-22 19:41:57	@Espyo	so I did
2015-07-22 19:41:59	@Espyo	BUT IT WAS STILL HIDDEN
2015-07-22 19:42:05	@Espyo	I NEEDED TO SAY THANKS ON THE THREAD OF THE GAME
2015-07-22 19:42:14	@Espyo	AND THEN THE LINK BECAME VISIBLE
2015-07-22 19:42:27	@Espyo	and now I'm on a MEGA page with parts to download the whole thing
2015-07-22 19:42:29	@Espyo	it's 22 GB big
2015-07-22 19:42:36	@Espyo	and each part is 250 MB, MEGA's limit
2015-07-22 19:42:43	@Espyo	...so I'm downloading almost 100 parts
2015-07-22 19:42:45	@Espyo	one by one
2015-07-22 19:42:47	@Espyo	painstakingly
2015-07-22 19:43:10	@Espyo	at least the downloads aren't really being slow
2015-07-22 19:43:23	@Espyo	what scares me the most, is that, by past experiences, I can just GUESS that this won't work
2015-07-22 19:43:31	@Espyo	like the final .rar file won't be able to be opened for some reason
2015-07-22 19:43:39	@Espyo	or the key to open it that they provided on the forum is wrong
2015-07-22 19:43:53	Yoshi2	oh joy
2015-07-22 19:43:58	Yoshi2	that would suck
2015-07-22 19:44:00	@Espyo	or even more likely, it's not a raw dump of files, but actually a file in some Wii U dump thingy format
2015-07-22 19:44:15	@Espyo	still keeping it; I'm not tossing it away after all this
2015-07-22 19:44:19	@Espyo	but we're now closer than ever before

2015-07-22 19:44:43	@Espyo	we once tried contacting a guy on Steam that added the models to GMod, from the game's files
2015-07-22 19:44:43	LoganPikmin	Hi guys
2015-07-22 19:44:47	@Espyo	but he was quieter than a rat

2015-07-22 19:44:48	Yoshi2	people are so secretive

2015-07-22 19:45:03	@Espyo	...if people ask, it'll be hard to explain...
2015-07-22 19:45:11	@Espyo	but at least I will actively attempt to help people get files and such
2015-07-22 19:45:19	LoganPikmin	ummm do all of you guys minus espyro have an account

2015-07-22 19:46:04	@Espyo	and Testyo, because he's a bot
2015-07-22 19:46:05	Testyo	battle_t, book, 2pbattle, comp_results, hiscore, id_test, n_tutorial_1stday and a couple other files play fairly well and are more entertaining than these games is already on the Humble Store
2015-07-22 19:46:12	@Espyo	I haven't been able to work on it for the past 3 days

2015-07-23 20:20:06	@Espyo	forgot what the shortcut is on windows
2015-07-23 20:20:31	@J	I think it's a modifier + print screen

2015-07-23 20:22:30	@Espyo	yeah, there's a button for print screen
2015-07-23 20:22:35	@Espyo	but I wanted just this window, AND saved automatically
2015-07-23 20:22:48	@Espyo	I REALLY don't want to open a paint program just to save a dumb image
2015-07-23 20:22:53	@Espyo	specially while the extraction is ongoing
2015-07-23 20:26:25	Yoshi2	some image hosters, e.g. imgur, allow you to Ctrl+V an image and it will upload it directly

2015-07-23 20:49:34	Pidgey	Or did someone figure out how to dump everything? When was this? How much am I missing?
2015-07-23 20:49:34	Yoshi2	Pidgey: dumped
2015-07-23 20:49:50	Yoshi2	you are not missing too much because I have no idea how it was done
2015-07-23 20:49:58	Yoshi2	but it has been done quite a while ago
2015-07-23 20:51:33	Pidgey	Ah, okay.
2015-07-23 20:51:44	@Espyo	dumps have been around for a while
2015-07-23 20:51:52	@Espyo	I just never found them nor knew how to open them
2015-07-23 20:51:54	@Espyo	but now...
2015-07-23 20:52:01	@Espyo	okay, I have the files, but the extraction process failed
2015-07-23 20:52:10	@Espyo	only 2GB worth of files... I'm not sure if that's all of it
2015-07-23 20:52:10	Yoshi2	it's finally happeni- DAMNIT

2015-07-23 20:52:29	@Espyo	they're our good old szs format
2015-07-23 20:52:33	@Espyo	but no tool I have can open them
2015-07-23 20:52:42	Yoshi2	wut
2015-07-23 20:53:20	@Espyo	probably new version of the szs format

2015-07-23 23:03:05	@PikFan	and then I warned him

2015-07-23 23:05:19	@Espyo	hm
2015-07-23 23:05:36	@PikFan	anyway, I wrote back, "It doesn't matter if it was a joke, it was still gibberish. Stuff like that is considered spam. We have a zero tolerance policy against spam, and spamming can get you blocked. So please don't add any more gibberish anymore, alright?"
2015-07-23 23:05:43	@PikFan	hopefully that gets the message across

2015-07-24 06:43:46	Pidgey	Espyo has them, but he's not here at the moment, as is plainly obvious.
2015-07-24 06:50:31	En_Passant	Well, yeah
2015-07-24 06:50:46	En_Passant	But were there any results?
2015-07-24 06:51:51	Pidgey	Apparently, there are Emperor Bulblax textures in P3. They're almost identical to the ones in P2.
2015-07-24 06:52:11	Miles	There should be more than just a texture...

2015-07-24 19:17:49	En_Passant	Shitty ones, but they pay for car insurance
2015-07-24 19:20:55	Yoshi2	in school I didn't know many people younger than 18 who had a car

2015-07-24 21:54:46	@PikFan	oops
2015-07-24 21:54:53	@Espyo	I'm not the kind to let details go by
2015-07-24 21:54:55	@Espyo	so if you had noticed
2015-07-24 21:55:01	@Espyo	you'd have spotted how all my other letters were caps
2015-07-24 21:55:07	@Espyo	so for me to go lowercase all of a sudden...

2015-07-24 21:55:28	@PikFan	ugh
2015-07-24 21:55:35	En_Passant	lowercase L is thicker
2015-07-24 21:55:45	Yoshi2	1
2015-07-24 21:56:12	Yoshi2	in my font, the lower case L is one pixel higher
2015-07-24 21:56:36	Yoshi2	well, more than a pixel because I have a high dpi screen, but you get my point
2015-07-24 21:58:24	@PikFan	is there a shortcut for summaries?
2015-07-24 21:59:17	En_Passant	Should we include All treasures single-segment on the Challenge run page?
2015-07-24 21:59:23	@Espyo	don't think there is
2015-07-24 21:59:30	@Espyo	but I just do alt+shift+I and do shift+tab
2015-07-24 21:59:43	@PikFan	what does shift+tab do?
2015-07-24 21:59:51	@Espyo	single and multi segment already has a section on it
2015-07-24 21:59:53	@Espyo	it applies to all runs
2015-07-24 21:59:57	@Espyo	so...
2015-07-24 22:00:05	@Espyo	PikFan: goes to the previous uh... widget
2015-07-24 22:00:14	@Espyo	widget being a checkbox, a textbox, a button, etc.

2015-07-24 22:08:34	@Espyo	didn't take long
2015-07-24 22:08:47	@Espyo	oh, I also made a script to show a "[edit]" next to a search result
2015-07-24 22:08:54	@Espyo	so I can skip the step where I click the edit button
2015-07-24 22:10:02	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-24 22:11:58	En_Passant	What color should I make an Iridescent Flint Beetle antenna?
2015-07-24 22:12:12	@Espyo	hm, black?
2015-07-24 22:12:18	@Espyo	captures more sunlight
2015-07-24 22:12:31	@Espyo	dunno why an antenna would need sunlight
2015-07-24 22:12:56	En_Passant	Well, I have a black outline around everything
2015-07-24 22:13:04	En_Passant	That's how I do things
2015-07-24 22:13:08	En_Passant	So it might look a bit weird
2015-07-24 22:13:26	En_Passant	Plus, it was white in 1 & 2 and blue-purple in 3
2015-07-24 22:13:28	@Espyo	right
2015-07-24 22:16:12	@PikFan	gah
2015-07-24 22:16:15	En_Passant	The IFB's mosutache is black in 3, though
2015-07-24 22:16:19	@PikFan	my game is really getting to me
2015-07-24 22:16:20	En_Passant	So maybe I'll try it
2015-07-24 22:16:27	@PikFan	mosutache
2015-07-24 22:16:30	@PikFan	amazing
2015-07-24 22:17:01	@PikFan	anyway, yeah
2015-07-24 22:17:15	@PikFan	the area order is just making me go ugh
2015-07-24 22:17:36	@PikFan	maybe I have too many Pikmin types...?
2015-07-24 22:19:48	En_Passant	I don't think so
2015-07-24 22:20:08	@PikFan	most fanon games have like 3 new types, at most
2015-07-24 22:20:11	@PikFan	mine has 5
2015-07-24 22:20:22	@PikFan	that's a problem
2015-07-24 22:21:18	En_Passant	That's not true
2015-07-24 22:21:22	En_Passant	A lot of them have 5
2015-07-24 22:21:28	En_Passant	(some have more)
2015-07-24 22:21:37	@PikFan	like which ones?
2015-07-24 22:21:38	Yoshi2	too many new types can be an issue
2015-07-24 22:21:48	@PikFan	Yoshi2: mhm
2015-07-24 22:22:03	Yoshi2	it's not good if you start losing focus
2015-07-24 22:22:17	@PikFan	which is what's happening to me
2015-07-24 22:23:04	@PikFan	hmmmm...

2015-07-24 22:29:28	En_Passant	Dirt and sand are pretty similar
2015-07-24 22:29:31	@PikFan	right, I was thinking that too
2015-07-24 22:29:42	En_Passant	You could also cut Burgundy Pikmin entirely
2015-07-24 22:29:43	@PikFan	I actually mentioned it once
2015-07-24 22:29:53	@PikFan	mhm, yes
2015-07-24 22:30:00	En_Passant	I don't see Reds can't be immune to heat
2015-07-24 22:30:06	@PikFan	but Red Pikmin can't breathe in lava
2015-07-24 22:30:57	@PikFan	I was thinking about having an upgrade that lets them breathe in lava...?
2015-07-24 22:31:00	En_Passant	Use Wingeds
2015-07-24 22:31:07	En_Passant	They can fly over lava
2015-07-24 22:31:16	En_Passant	And rise on thermals, too, for a fun mechanic
2015-07-24 22:31:24	@PikFan	hmm
2015-07-24 22:31:33	@PikFan	I actually had flying Pikmin at one point
2015-07-24 22:31:37	@PikFan	but I removed them
2015-07-24 22:34:34	@PikFan	let's see...
2015-07-24 22:34:44	@PikFan	so, right now, I have six different areas:
2015-07-24 22:35:08	@PikFan	tundra, forest, lake, desert, mountain, volcano
2015-07-24 22:35:56	@PikFan	I was thinking about adding a grassland area

2015-07-24 22:41:53	@PikFan	but each area only has 1 cave
2015-07-24 22:42:31	@PikFan	I actually came up with some new names, but they're on the desktop I never use
2015-07-24 22:44:53	En_Passant	Well, obviously I'm going to discourage you copying me
2015-07-24 22:45:19	@PikFan	who said anything about copying? :P
2015-07-24 22:45:33	@PikFan	I was just looking at your area names
2015-07-24 22:46:02	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-07-24 22:46:16	@PikFan	maybe I could split the Shimmering Lake into two separate areas
2015-07-24 22:47:07	@PikFan	I could have a bay area, with sand and such, similar to the Tropical Wilds
2015-07-24 22:47:23	@PikFan	and then I could have another forest area, but it would be darker, and have a swamp in it

2015-07-24 22:53:38	En_Passant	I feel like they're too desolate
2015-07-24 22:54:18	@PikFan	how so?
2015-07-24 22:54:38	@PikFan	you haven't even made any areas yet
2015-07-24 22:54:47	En_Passant	Deserts, snowy areas, and big plains aren't very pretty or encouraging to life
2015-07-24 22:54:55	En_Passant	And that's 2/3 of my areas
2015-07-24 22:55:03	@PikFan	>big plains
2015-07-24 22:55:10	@PikFan	you mean like grasslands, or what?
2015-07-24 22:55:24	En_Passant	Like central United States
2015-07-24 22:55:55	En_Passant	I've seen it before. There's not a whole lot there
2015-07-24 22:56:03	Testyo	oooo, might need externs
2015-07-24 22:56:05	En_Passant	Though that's not the one I'm worried about
2015-07-24 22:57:32	En_Passant	I'm still uncertain of what my snowy region should have in it
2015-07-24 23:01:49	@PikFan	you could try having some cave systems like in the Distant Tundra
2015-07-24 23:02:32	En_Passant	I already have a whole area that's a cave system

2015-07-25 20:53:04	Yoshi2	because ultramario has to use mibbit on his wii u until his notebook is repaired
2015-07-25 20:53:52	UltraMario	im sorry
2015-07-25 20:54:03	UltraMario	also its a laptop :p
2015-07-25 20:54:26	@PikFan	I'm glad that the wii u has tabbed browsing, but it's just so annoying that the tabs always reload whenever you go to another one
2015-07-25 20:54:41	@Espyo	it's not any better than using bookmarks, then
2015-07-25 20:54:47	UltraMario	thats why i di
2015-07-25 20:54:50	UltraMario	e
2015-07-25 20:55:07	UltraMario	i try not too have too many tabs but i still die
2015-07-25 20:55:11	UltraMario	:<
2015-07-25 20:55:19	Yoshi2	UltraMario: what's the difference between a laptop and a notebook
2015-07-25 20:55:25	UltraMario	i like the Wii U browser tho watching vids on tvs is cool
2015-07-25 20:55:47	UltraMario	idk but i think theres a difference
2015-07-25 20:56:54	@PikFan	we can only blame nintendo's subpar programming
2015-07-25 20:56:54	UltraMario	anyway
2015-07-25 20:57:02	Yoshi2	if you think there is a difference, please explain it to me
2015-07-25 20:57:10	UltraMario	i can't wait for super mario maker
2015-07-25 20:57:10	Yoshi2	I want to hear your train of though
2015-07-25 20:57:23	UltraMario	i dont remember
2015-07-25 20:58:09	@PikFan	notebooks are smaller than laptops
2015-07-25 20:58:15	UltraMario	theres that
2015-07-25 20:58:26	@PikFan	"A laptop computer, or simply laptop, is a portable computer which usually weighs 4-8 pounds (2 to 4 kilograms), depending on display size, hardware, and other factors. A notebook is a personal computer that foregoes some functionality to remain lightweight and small."
2015-07-25 20:58:27	Testyo	-8 pounds = -3.6288 kg / -0.5712 st / -128 oz
2015-07-25 20:58:45	UltraMario	im gonna be recreating old mario levels and maybe some original levels
2015-07-25 20:59:00	Yoshi2	"A laptop or a notebook is a portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor, suitable for mobile use.[1] Although there used to be a distinction between laptops and notebooks (the latter were smaller and lighter than the former), there is often no longer any difference in practice."
2015-07-25 20:59:12	UltraMario	:|
2015-07-25 20:59:42	UltraMario	to be fair my laptop is pretty ig
2015-07-25 20:59:42	@PikFan	Yoshi2 you pretty much just invalidated your own argument
2015-07-25 20:59:43	UltraMario	big
2015-07-25 20:59:57	UltraMario	so it is laptop
2015-07-25 21:00:07	Yoshi2	PikFan: what was my argument?
2015-07-25 21:00:20	UltraMario	there wasn't a difference
2015-07-25 21:00:22	@PikFan	that there was a difference between laptops and notebooks
2015-07-25 21:00:29	UltraMario	*was
2015-07-25 21:00:47	Yoshi2	I never said anything like that
2015-07-25 21:00:50	Pi	There is a difference, but only in tryhard land.
2015-07-25 21:01:03	@PikFan	heh
2015-07-25 21:01:12	UltraMario	lol

2015-07-25 21:01:14	@PikFan	oh hey, is anybody good at computer science?
2015-07-25 21:02:27	Yoshi2	PikFan: that's what I'm studying
2015-07-25 21:02:36	@PikFan	oh lol
2015-07-25 21:02:48	@PikFan	then can you explain to me what P=NP means
2015-07-25 21:03:16	 *	Yoshi2 walks away quietly
2015-07-25 21:03:27	@PikFan	hahahahah
2015-07-25 21:03:31	Yoshi2	haven't had that yet, I'm only in the second semester
2015-07-25 21:03:43	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-25 21:03:53	@PikFan	I stumbled across it the other day
2015-07-25 21:03:59	@PikFan	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem
2015-07-25 21:04:41	Yoshi2	I'll read up on that and see if it makes sense to me
2015-07-25 21:06:11	UltraMario	anyone else here hyped for SMM?
2015-07-25 21:06:25	UltraMario	besides Yoshi2 :p
2015-07-25 21:06:26	@PikFan	it looks interesting
2015-07-25 21:06:35	@PikFan	I'll probably get it for christmas
2015-07-25 21:06:38	UltraMario	i already know youre hyped :D
2015-07-25 21:06:41	UltraMario	cool
2015-07-25 21:06:53	Yoshi2	UltraMario: I'm hyped for it. Did I already tell you that I'm hyped for it? I think I didn't tell you enough that I'm hyped for it :>
2015-07-25 21:07:02	UltraMario	can't wait to remake obscure
2015-07-25 21:07:05	UltraMario	levels
2015-07-25 21:07:08	UltraMario	also lol
2015-07-25 21:07:14	Pi	I can explain.
2015-07-25 21:07:24	@PikFan	I still think that it's just nintendo's attempt to shut down those hackers
2015-07-25 21:07:32	UltraMario	wat
2015-07-25 21:07:40	UltraMario	you mean romhacks?
2015-07-25 21:07:43	UltraMario	i dunno
2015-07-25 21:07:44	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-25 21:07:47	Pi	P = NP is a matter of how hard a general problem is, when you want to solve them for large numbers.
2015-07-25 21:07:58	UltraMario	i mean it seems like it's own thing
2015-07-25 21:08:09	UltraMario	also its way easier to use
2015-07-25 21:08:15	Pi	P stands for polynomial time, meaning that the problem isn't very hard to solve.
2015-07-25 21:08:31	UltraMario	Pi = Nintendo Power
2015-07-25 21:08:35	UltraMario	;)
2015-07-25 21:09:26	@PikFan	then does NP stand for non-polynomial time, like exponential time?
2015-07-25 21:09:42	Pi	NP stands for non-polynomial time, meaning the difficulty of the problem increases non-polynomially. This increase is defined as faster than polynomial increase. I don't know if there are problems that increase logarithmically, but I doubt it.
2015-07-25 21:10:00	Yoshi2	P contains all the problems that can be solved by a deterministic (turing) machine in polynomial time, i.e. there is an upper bound for how long it will run
2015-07-25 21:10:03	UltraMario	for me np will always be Nintendo Power. :<
2015-07-25 21:10:13	UltraMario	rip Nintendo Power
2015-07-25 21:10:39	@PikFan	hmm

2015-07-25 21:21:14	Yoshi2	Pi: I think NP refers to nondeterministic polynomial time, i.e. the problem is still solved in polynomial time, but a non-deterministic turing machine is used
2015-07-25 21:21:31	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-07-25 21:21:31	Yoshi2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_%28complexity%29 "The abbreviation NP refers to "nondeterministic polynomial time."
2015-07-25 21:21:42	@PikFan	it's a common misconception
2015-07-25 21:22:00	@PikFan	from what I read, anyway
2015-07-25 21:22:30	Yoshi2	P is a subset of NP because deterministic stuff can be solved in a non-deterministic way, which has been proven
2015-07-25 21:23:00	Yoshi2	now, if NP was a subset of P, i.e. all non-deterministic problems have a deterministic solution, we'd have P=NP
2015-07-25 21:23:21	Pi	ah
2015-07-25 21:23:26	Pi	I'm dumb
2015-07-25 21:23:37	@PikFan	no
2015-07-25 21:23:50	@PikFan	you're not dumb
2015-07-25 21:23:58	@PikFan	I hardly understand this
2015-07-25 21:24:00	Yoshi2	but proof of either P=NP or P!=NP has yet to be found
2015-07-25 21:24:19	@PikFan	...polynomial time factorial?
2015-07-25 21:24:42	@PikFan	or am I misreading that
2015-07-25 21:25:13	Yoshi2	where did you read that?
2015-07-25 21:25:29	@PikFan	"P!=NP"
2015-07-25 21:25:40	@PikFan	and the ! makes me think factorial
2015-07-25 21:25:41	Yoshi2	oh
2015-07-25 21:25:56	Yoshi2	P != NP, i.e. "P not equal to NP"
2015-07-25 21:26:02	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-25 21:26:23	@PikFan	in that case, don't you mean P≠NP?
2015-07-25 21:26:29	Yoshi2	!= is commonly used in programming languages
2015-07-25 21:26:35	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-25 21:26:41	@PikFan	see, I know nothing
2015-07-25 21:26:57	Yoshi2	but yeah, P≠NP works

2015-07-26 02:09:56	@PikFan	I'd like to remove those, but they appear on canon enemy pages, and it'd break things
2015-07-26 02:10:32	@PikFan	there's got to be a better way...
2015-07-26 02:11:13	@PikFan	either we could make it so that there would be one infobox with stats from ALL games, or use the infobox for each game
2015-07-26 02:11:28	@PikFan	and neither is really a good choice
2015-07-26 02:12:22	@PikFan	although for the one infobox thing, we could use show/hide

2015-07-26 02:21:44	En_Passant	Either you're going to have each section (like Health or Pokos) be show/hide, which is unwieldy

2015-07-26 02:24:40	@PikFan	other than the gigantic spaces, yeah
2015-07-26 02:26:04	En_Passant	Really?
2015-07-26 02:26:36	En_Passant	Well, either way, I think having blank spaces is better than having to scroll to the top of the page to look at the infobox
2015-07-26 02:26:49	@PikFan	hm, true

2015-07-26 02:47:51	En_Passant	Figure out your area problem, PikFan?
2015-07-26 02:47:59	@PikFan	nope
2015-07-26 02:48:29	@PikFan	well, maybe
2015-07-26 02:48:53	@PikFan	I think that I should add a couple more areas, like I already said
2015-07-26 02:49:09	@PikFan	but I have to figure out what kind of areas I want them to be
2015-07-26 02:49:50	@PikFan	say, the Awakening Wood and Wistful Wild are both forests areas, right?
2015-07-26 02:50:19	@PikFan	*forest
2015-07-26 02:50:37	En_Passant	I guess
2015-07-26 02:51:24	@PikFan	I was against areas having TOO similar environments, but...
2015-07-26 02:51:37	@PikFan	and I still am, sort of
2015-07-26 02:51:55	@PikFan	but there's already a ton of diversity
2015-07-26 02:51:59	@PikFan	so eh
2015-07-26 02:53:37	@PikFan	hmm, maybe I could add a boreal forest area
2015-07-26 02:54:03	@PikFan	it'd be like a mix of a regular forest and a tundrs
2015-07-26 02:54:05	@PikFan	*tundra
2015-07-26 02:55:24	@PikFan	I now potentially have 4 new areas: a grassland area, a boreal forest area, a beach area, and a marsh area
2015-07-26 02:55:26	En_Passant	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga Like this?
2015-07-26 02:55:31	@PikFan	mhm, yes
2015-07-26 02:55:51	@PikFan	the beach and marsh area would replace the Shimmering Lake
2015-07-26 02:57:05	@PikFan	so that'd bring my area total to 9
2015-07-26 02:57:45	@PikFan	...perfect
2015-07-26 02:58:33	@PikFan	if we combine Tan and Brown Pikmin, then that's 9 main Pikmin types
2015-07-26 02:59:16	@PikFan	well, now people won't have to visit every area at least 3 times for 100% completion
2015-07-26 03:00:35	@PikFan	Espyo: you sure are up late
2015-07-26 03:00:36	En_Passant	You're going to have a Pikmin type on the Moon?
2015-07-26 03:00:39	@PikFan	no
2015-07-26 03:00:48	@PikFan	I'm getting rid of that area
2015-07-26 03:00:49	@Espyo	yeah, just doing random stuff
2015-07-26 03:00:52	@PikFan	along with the Portal

2015-07-26 03:01:54	@PikFan	En_Passant: there used to be a Pikmin type on the Moon, but I got rid of it
2015-07-26 03:03:33	En_Passant	So where will Asfer be found?
2015-07-26 03:03:49	@PikFan	the Moon
2015-07-26 03:04:04	@PikFan	the thing is, it's not going to be an open, explorable area
2015-07-26 03:04:11	@PikFan	it'll just be a dungeon
2015-07-26 03:04:38	En_Passant	Why is he on the moon?
2015-07-26 03:04:54	En_Passant	If he's stockpiling treasures, shouldn't he be where the treasures are?
2015-07-26 03:05:05	@PikFan	good point
2015-07-26 03:05:12	@PikFan	but he needs a place to hide
2015-07-26 03:05:20	En_Passant	Okay, the planet is huge
2015-07-26 03:05:29	En_Passant	I'm sure he can find some secluded location
2015-07-26 03:06:02	@PikFan	19:04	En_Passant	If he's stockpiling treasures, shouldn't he be where the treasures are?
2015-07-26 03:06:27	@PikFan	well, now that you mention it, he WANTS them to think he's on the planet
2015-07-26 03:06:38	@PikFan	they'd never suspect he'd be on the moon
2015-07-26 03:07:05	En_Passant	Yeah, because it's impractical
2015-07-26 03:07:43	En_Passant	Having the element of surprise is one thing, but giving up a tactical location probably isn't worth it
2015-07-26 03:08:02	@PikFan	well, that's where his bases come into play

2015-07-26 03:09:05	@PikFan	I need to update that, and not say it's abandoned
2015-07-26 03:10:35	En_Passant	Wait, you have two days of tutorials?
2015-07-26 03:10:59	@PikFan	yeah
2015-07-26 03:11:06	En_Passant	Why?
2015-07-26 03:11:09	@PikFan	doesn't P2 have two days of tutorials?
2015-07-26 03:11:17	En_Passant	Yeah, and it was a waste
2015-07-26 03:11:25	En_Passant	And it had infinite days
2015-07-26 03:11:51	@PikFan	so you're saying it should just be one day
2015-07-26 03:11:56	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-07-26 03:12:03	@PikFan	hm, possibly
2015-07-26 03:12:50	@PikFan	...oh, I see what you mean now
2015-07-26 03:13:23	@PikFan	I thought you meant being able to go to a cave on day 1, but you'd lose Pikmin, which isn't really good for a tutorial day
2015-07-26 03:17:12	En_Passant	Well, if that cave was the tutorial cave, then sure
2015-07-26 03:17:29	En_Passant	P2 did that with Emergence Cave
2015-07-26 03:19:26	@PikFan	if I were to have a tutorial cave on day 1, it'd have to have harmless enemies
2015-07-26 03:19:46	@PikFan	because of the whole losing Pikmin thing
2015-07-26 03:20:32	En_Passant	Yeah, and maybe then The Garden won't need to be harmless
2015-07-26 03:21:05	@PikFan	oh, that's becoming the Whispering Woods
2015-07-26 03:21:25	@PikFan	the Garden will become a subarea in it unlocked at the very end of the game
2015-07-26 03:23:13	@PikFan	anyway, I gotta go

2015-07-26 13:57:31	@J	the blaze powder should be easy on a known seed, but do you even get enderman spawners?
2015-07-26 13:58:51	Yoshi2	dungeon chests could be a bit unreliable
2015-07-26 13:59:03	Yoshi2	but endermen spawning is also unreliable
2015-07-26 13:59:28	@Espyo	don't think there are endermen spawners

2015-07-27 00:16:18	UltraMario	so does Pikmin take place at the same time as Mega Man games? ;P
2015-07-27 00:18:52	En_Passant	I can't seem to find where it states that Louie was left behind after Pikmin 3

2015-07-27 19:08:22	UltraMario	hey Espyo
2015-07-27 19:08:42	UltraMario	I put another question in the Ink Pumps thing
2015-07-27 19:08:50	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-27 19:08:52	@Espyo	oh, okay
2015-07-27 19:08:54	@Espyo	I'll check later
2015-07-27 19:09:14	UltraMario	Yea
2015-07-27 19:09:39	UltraMario	this would probably be easier to implement than the last thing I suggested
2015-07-27 19:10:19	UltraMario	also Espyo
2015-07-27 19:10:30	UltraMario	Inkipedia is being weird today
2015-07-27 19:10:36	UltraMario	maybe it's just on my end
2015-07-27 19:10:41	@Espyo	how come?
2015-07-27 19:11:07	UltraMario	sometimes it doesn't load in my Wii U for a bit, and then a minute or two later, it starts working again
2015-07-27 19:11:11	UltraMario	:s
2015-07-27 19:11:17	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-27 19:11:27	@Espyo	does any other website do that?
2015-07-27 19:12:26	UltraMario	well, not really, i mean when the page is all blank and has the background color the same as the site's, it usually means it's an inactive tab waiting to display
2015-07-27 19:12:30	UltraMario	but that's different
2015-07-27 19:12:34	UltraMario	so
2015-07-27 19:13:25	UltraMario	it's pretty weird
2015-07-27 19:13:42	UltraMario	also i'm contributing pretty good today :>
2015-07-27 19:14:09	UltraMario	adding character quotes and uploading screenshots directly from my  Wii U
2015-07-27 19:14:17	@Espyo	nice
2015-07-27 19:14:28	@Espyo	yeah, dunno, I guess the wiki is just a bit heavy
2015-07-27 19:14:58	UltraMario	as Marty McFly once said
2015-07-27 19:15:09	UltraMario	"This is heavy."
2015-07-27 19:15:19	UltraMario	- Marty McFly, 1985
2015-07-27 19:16:30	UltraMario	also I can't be the only one to think Power Eggs look like Dragon Balls, right? :p
2015-07-27 19:17:41	@Espyo	ehhhhhh, more or less
2015-07-27 19:18:10	UltraMario	they're like Dragon Balls without the stats
2015-07-27 19:18:14	UltraMario	*stars
2015-07-27 19:18:32	UltraMario	they also kinda look like Marlin's eggs in Finding Nemo
2015-07-27 19:18:45	UltraMario	maybe that's what they were going for..

2015-07-27 19:41:14	UltraMario	but now it's not working for me and

2015-07-27 19:45:16	UltraMario	hmm
2015-07-27 19:45:43	UltraMario	Espyo do you think if I use Inkipedia's mobile view it might do that less?

2015-07-27 20:47:46	@PikFan	the battle takes place in a quagmire
2015-07-27 20:48:28	UltraMario	...
2015-07-27 20:48:55	UltraMario	that definition sounds like it could be an innuendo :p
2015-07-27 20:49:04	UltraMario	maybe that's why he's named Quagmire
2015-07-27 20:49:54	@PikFan	?
2015-07-27 20:50:36	@PikFan	...oh, the Family Guy character
2015-07-27 20:50:41	@PikFan	derp
2015-07-27 20:50:46	UltraMario	yeah :p
2015-07-27 20:51:02	@PikFan	I don't watch Family Guy, so I wouldn't know
2015-07-27 20:51:09	UltraMario	i used to
2015-07-27 20:51:37	UltraMario	but it's one of those shows that has suffered from seasonal rot
2015-07-27 20:51:41	@PikFan	but how does its definition sound like an innuendo
2015-07-27 20:51:48	UltraMario	like SpongeBob
2015-07-27 20:52:02	UltraMario	!def boggy
2015-07-27 20:52:03	BetaMaster	Containing or full of bogs: It was difficult walking through the boggy terrain.
2015-07-27 20:52:12	UltraMario	soft boggy
2015-07-27 20:52:33	UltraMario	i dunno im dumb
2015-07-27 20:52:37	 *	UltraMario :p
2015-07-27 20:52:46	@PikFan	it's ok
2015-07-27 20:52:55	@PikFan	I'm really slow to understand things
2015-07-27 20:53:09	UltraMario	hey Espyo how does this look? http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splatoon
2015-07-27 20:53:09	@PikFan	and I make everything overly complicated
2015-07-27 20:53:16	UltraMario	the quote i added
2015-07-27 20:53:26	UltraMario	PikFan i do that too sometimes :p
2015-07-27 20:53:54	@Espyo	hmm, not so good
2015-07-27 20:53:55	@Espyo	tell you what
2015-07-27 20:53:59	@Espyo	on the "who" part
2015-07-27 20:54:01	UltraMario	ono ;w;
2015-07-27 20:54:05	@Espyo	put "Splatoon's official website"
2015-07-27 20:54:10	@Espyo	and it should be good then
2015-07-27 20:54:10	UltraMario	okay gotcha
2015-07-27 20:54:16	@Espyo	otherwise it just looks like a voice out of nowhere
2015-07-27 20:54:23	UltraMario	i knew that blank space was kinda offputting
2015-07-27 20:54:58	UltraMario	i'll put the The home page of Splatoon's official website
2015-07-27 20:55:05	UltraMario	or is that too specific
2015-07-27 20:55:26	@Espyo	too specific
2015-07-27 20:55:39	UltraMario	aw okay :p
2015-07-27 20:56:29	UltraMario	hey Espyo there should be an article covering the Splatoon commercials maybe
2015-07-27 20:56:37	@Espyo	agreed
2015-07-27 20:56:47	UltraMario	or is that not important enough to cover
2015-07-27 20:56:54	UltraMario	i dunno :p
2015-07-27 20:57:03	@Espyo	maybe not NOW
2015-07-27 20:57:06	@Espyo	but likely eventually
2015-07-27 20:57:11	@Espyo	heck, [[Promotional material]]
2015-07-27 20:57:11	Testyo	"Promotional_material" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Promotional_material
2015-07-27 20:57:55	UltraMario	and in the trivia section it can be noted that the Squid Kid commercial's repetitive nature was enough to been made into a meme
2015-07-27 20:58:01	UltraMario	:p
2015-07-27 20:58:07	UltraMario	amirite
2015-07-27 20:58:19	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2015-07-27 20:58:51	UltraMario	also I'd say there could be YouTube videos embedded on the page but that'd probably be a bit much if there's more than like 3 commercials
2015-07-27 20:58:57	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2015-07-27 20:59:00	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-27 20:59:34	UltraMario	you should bring it up with the other sysops or something so i don't forget about it and i know when it's alright to make an article on
2015-07-27 20:59:37	UltraMario	:p
2015-07-27 20:59:51	@Espyo	put it on the ink pump
2015-07-27 20:59:56	@Espyo	at least that way it won't be forgotten
2015-07-27 20:59:58	@Espyo	...until it gets forgotten
2015-07-27 21:00:03	@Espyo	but then it can be moved to the current projects
2015-07-27 21:00:07	@Espyo	and it won't leave that until it's done
2015-07-27 21:00:14	UltraMario	ok
2015-07-27 21:00:24	UltraMario	Espyo : better? http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splatoon
2015-07-27 21:00:53	UltraMario	when i add bios for characters and other stuff should i still put that for the who?
2015-07-27 21:01:31	@Espyo	well, besides the comma there, it's okay
2015-07-27 21:01:38	@Espyo	hm, yeah, do it
2015-07-27 21:01:47	UltraMario	also, i put a todo template on Booyah Base, Jelonzo, and Spyke because they could use more quotes

2015-07-27 21:02:27	UltraMario	do you think you can make the commercial thing an Ink Pump so I can keep at it with these bios from the website?
2015-07-27 21:02:44	UltraMario	sorry if it's a burden or something :<
2015-07-27 21:02:57	@Espyo	sorry, really busy
2015-07-27 21:03:05	UltraMario	that's fine.
2015-07-27 21:03:37	UltraMario	so should i start it now before i forget or do it after a bit of my maintenance to add these bios?
2015-07-27 21:03:42	UltraMario	:p
2015-07-27 21:04:59	UltraMario	i guess i'll do the latter, sorry i can't make up my mind sometimes xP
2015-07-27 21:06:09	@Espyo	it's fine
2015-07-27 21:06:18	@Espyo	real quick before you forget

2015-07-27 22:08:52	@PikFan	no, I meant when it releases

2015-07-27 22:15:34	UltraMario	i get more use out of Windows in general because it can play exe files without some program

2015-07-27 22:16:27	Yoshi2	because exe files were compiled specifically for windows
2015-07-27 22:16:30	@Espyo	yeah
2015-07-27 22:16:37	@PikFan	Espyo: so are you just going to wait for what people have to say about win10 and then decide?
2015-07-27 22:16:45	@Espyo	the creatures of a program can make an executable version for other operative systems, half the time
2015-07-27 22:16:54	@Espyo	for instance, my engine can work on windows, Linux and Mac
2015-07-27 22:16:58	@Espyo	without special things

2015-07-27 22:18:09	@Espyo	half of the programs I use daily have no valid alternative
2015-07-27 22:18:24	UltraMario	which means i can't play them on mac without a program

2015-07-27 22:56:43	@PikFan	I don't want to know what sort of whacked up thoughts you're thinking
2015-07-27 22:56:48	@Espyo	truths
2015-07-27 22:56:54	@PikFan	no
2015-07-27 22:57:08	@PikFan	everything is a lie
2015-07-27 22:57:10	@Espyo	hm, J, now that you're here...
2015-07-27 22:57:17	@Espyo	if you're not keeping up to date, I got access to the Pikmin 3 files
2015-07-27 22:57:21	@Espyo	and already made discoveries and such
2015-07-27 22:57:26	@Espyo	I was wondering
2015-07-27 22:57:35	@Espyo	would it be better for us to have a policy for this kind of content that we post?
2015-07-27 22:57:51	@Espyo	from data in internal files to unused content discovery to full-on textures?
2015-07-27 22:58:10	@Espyo	the usual, saying how we won't use them to promote piracy or theft of copyrighted material, but instead, just to educate
2015-07-27 22:58:12	Testyo	I... but the bloody system didn't send it
2015-07-27 22:58:16	@Espyo	or should we not make a big fuss out of it?
2015-07-27 22:58:29	@J	'theft'
2015-07-27 22:58:31	@Espyo	'cause the fellas really want to put the fact that we're making progress in the Pikmin 3 file department on the news
2015-07-27 22:58:45	@Espyo	hey, anybody can grab the textures we have on the wiki and use it for their next big game
2015-07-27 22:59:03	@J	I mean, it's the wrong word
2015-07-27 22:59:07	@J	look up the definition
2015-07-27 22:59:23	@Espyo	this almost sounds like the start of a piracy debate
2015-07-27 22:59:27	@J	hey, if Testyo swears, does he complain about himself?
2015-07-27 22:59:28	Testyo	I still haven't solved it fails less when I use the SMS parser, which means that I left something in the SMS parser that should be in the Pik1 parser
2015-07-27 22:59:48	 *	@PikFan silently walks away
2015-07-27 22:59:58	@J	well, there's no debate, it's just the dictionary
2015-07-27 23:00:25	@J	anyway, I would be against just putting e
2015-07-27 23:00:26	@J	...
2015-07-27 23:00:33	@J	just putting _everything_ on the wiki in general
2015-07-27 23:00:36	@Espyo	he doesn't
2015-07-27 23:00:46	@Espyo	of course we won't put everything
2015-07-27 23:00:47	@J	more like just examples
2015-07-27 23:00:55	@Espyo	just screenshots of unused models of enemies
2015-07-27 23:00:59	@Espyo	textures only when it makes sense
2015-07-27 23:01:02	@Espyo	like the Pikmin drawings
2015-07-27 23:01:13	@Espyo	it's either clear textures or KopPad screenshots with crooked angles and poor lighting
2015-07-27 23:01:18	@J	and numbers that mean something in the actual game
2015-07-27 23:01:23	@Espyo	other than that, raw numbers like — yeah

2015-07-27 23:01:39	@Espyo	it can always be debated that we got the numbers by analysis
2015-07-27 23:01:46	@Espyo	I mean, Miles got the HP values by analysis, didn't he?
2015-07-27 23:01:46	@J	yeah, I wouldn't bother with a legal notice or anything
2015-07-27 23:01:58	@J	it's no different from canon stuff like screenshots
2015-07-27 23:02:01	@Espyo	I guess the stuff we have on {{texture}} and such is enough

2015-07-27 23:04:21	@J	out of interest, what are the Windows-only programs you use 'daily'?
2015-07-27 23:04:23	@J	except games
2015-07-27 23:04:41	@Espyo	let's see...
2015-07-27 23:05:05	@Espyo	anything involving extracting data from Nintendo game files
2015-07-27 23:05:13	@Espyo	unless the source is available, but even then, it only sometimes is
2015-07-27 23:05:27	@Espyo	skype calls aren't compatible between different OSes
2015-07-27 23:05:45	@Espyo	I'd have to reconvert Testyo using the time I don't have
2015-07-27 23:05:46	Testyo	yeah, just what I had that for a while
2015-07-27 23:05:51	@Espyo	plus knowing me, I'd clean him up on the way there
2015-07-27 23:05:54	@Espyo	taking even more time...
2015-07-27 23:06:07	@Espyo	I have yet to find a text editor as powerful as Notepad++
2015-07-27 23:06:14	@Espyo	though that's more of a comodity
2015-07-27 23:06:24	@Espyo	*commodity
2015-07-27 23:06:57	@Espyo	Winamp doesn't really work outside of windows
2015-07-27 23:07:05	UltraMario	thats why I like Windows better, it has a lot more stuff that I can only use on Windows that I couldn't do on Mac
2015-07-27 23:07:08	@Espyo	Wine can run it, but it crashes upon trying anything
2015-07-27 23:07:14	UltraMario	:p
2015-07-27 23:07:16	@Espyo	I use Winamp because of the plugins for a lot of the types I hear
2015-07-27 23:07:27	@Espyo	that's not so much a reason to like it as it is a reason to use it
2015-07-27 23:07:45	@Espyo	FRAPS, in a sense? though there are probably alternatives
2015-07-27 23:07:48	@J	I'm sure I've used Skype across OSs before
2015-07-27 23:07:53	UltraMario	it's enough of a reason for me to use the programs i like :p
2015-07-27 23:07:55	@Espyo	for typing, it works
2015-07-27 23:07:57	@Espyo	but not for calls
2015-07-27 23:07:58	@J	not recently, though, and it's terrible anyway
2015-07-27 23:08:02	@J	no, definitely calls
2015-07-27 23:08:05	@Espyo	you sure?
2015-07-27 23:08:08	@J	yep
2015-07-27 23:08:11	@J	few years ago now
2015-07-27 23:08:11	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-27 23:08:21	@Espyo	oh, on the subject of skype
2015-07-27 23:08:25	UltraMario	like any game that's not on steam that's an exe
2015-07-27 23:08:27	@Espyo	if I want to record calls to put on Smash Bros. compilation videos
2015-07-27 23:08:32	@Espyo	there's no program to record with
2015-07-27 23:08:36	@Espyo	unless I do it the old fashioned way
2015-07-27 23:08:40	@J	well, most of the stuff you mentioned has reasonable alternatives, but I was just interested
2015-07-27 23:08:44	UltraMario	or ga,ss like audiosurf which are exclusive
2015-07-27 23:08:53	@Espyo	but I'd have to record my mic and my speakers (can I even do that? it's basically impossible on windows), then have to synch it manually
2015-07-27 23:08:54	UltraMario	*games
2015-07-27 23:09:04	@Espyo	right, and the list goes on

2015-07-27 23:09:12	@Espyo	I have to admit the thought of changing scares me a bit
2015-07-27 23:09:21	@Espyo	what if I find some big thing I actually liked on windows and can't have back?
2015-07-27 23:09:25	@Espyo	but the big factor really is the programs
2015-07-27 23:09:31	@Espyo	I mean, I work on Ubuntu at work
2015-07-27 23:09:37	@Espyo	I literally use Ubuntu more than windows
2015-07-27 23:09:43	@Espyo	granted, it also has weird flaws, like random crashes
2015-07-27 23:09:50	UltraMario	"I have to admit the thought of changing scares me a bit"
2015-07-27 23:09:52	@Espyo	but I'd EASILY trade random stupid crashes for random logical crashes
2015-07-27 23:09:59	UltraMario	that's exactly my point
2015-07-27 23:10:39	UltraMario	woops copypasted wrong
2015-07-27 23:10:48	@Espyo	some things are also a bit excessively hard on Linux, from my experience
2015-07-27 23:10:48	UltraMario	"what if I find some big thing I actually liked on windows and can't have back?"
2015-07-27 23:10:53	@Espyo	like for instance, changing the system's sounds
2015-07-27 23:11:05	@J	recording sound in all sorts of ways is supposed to be possible with PulseAudio or JACK, but they never worked for me
2015-07-27 23:11:08	@Espyo	not really that common, but if you want to do it, you better take a 30-hour course on the internals
2015-07-27 23:11:15	@Espyo	hmmm...
2015-07-27 23:11:18	UltraMario	that's what i'm trying to say, except i already have big things on windows i can't have back
2015-07-27 23:11:19	@Espyo	I sure hear a lot about PulseAudio
2015-07-27 23:11:30	@Espyo	right, but I meant more feature-wise
2015-07-27 23:11:32	@Espyo	not so much programs
2015-07-27 23:11:59	UltraMario	oic
2015-07-27 23:12:01	@J	lots of stuff people worry about seems weird to me
2015-07-27 23:12:10	@J	but I'm a very special type of computer user
2015-07-27 23:12:16	@J	so I just find it interesting
2015-07-27 23:12:24	UltraMario	that's what i mean except change features to programs
2015-07-27 23:12:29	UltraMario	:p
2015-07-27 23:12:36	@J	I will admit I only used an OS other than Windows when a computer broke
2015-07-27 23:12:41	UltraMario	programs are the most important part to me, imo
2015-07-27 23:12:43	@J	in that case it's really easy to try something else
2015-07-27 23:12:50	UltraMario	along with stability, of course
2015-07-27 23:13:00	UltraMario	but they're like the meat of your computer
2015-07-27 23:13:16	@J	anyway, nowadays the sorts of programs I want to use are not at all available on Windows
2015-07-27 23:13:18	@Espyo	hm
2015-07-27 23:13:24	@Espyo	yeah, that's for sure
2015-07-27 23:13:57	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2015-07-27 23:14:01	@J	I dual-booted for a few years, but now I don't even bother
2015-07-27 23:14:16	@J	every now and then a game comes along that's Windows-only
2015-07-27 23:14:28	@J	then I realise I own 30 games I haven't finished yet
2015-07-27 23:14:30	@Espyo	same, I dual-booted for a bit
2015-07-27 23:14:41	UltraMario	I haven't seen anything that's exclusive to Mac so far that's not an alternative, or something i actuality care about :p
2015-07-27 23:14:44	@J	and that the game will probably be available to me in a few years anyway
2015-07-27 23:14:45	UltraMario	so
2015-07-27 23:14:51	 *	UltraMario shrugs
2015-07-27 23:14:56	@Espyo	hm, I mostly play on my consoles now

2015-07-27 23:15:25	@J	hmm, I think the last non-Linux game I bought was Skyward Sword
2015-07-27 23:15:25	@Espyo	no real reason, just one of those days

2015-07-29 22:31:30	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikipedia:Sandbox how's this?
2015-07-29 22:33:53	En_Passant	Works for me
2015-07-29 22:36:03	@Espyo	it's not working on mobile for now
2015-07-29 22:36:18	@Espyo	anyway, it feels... VERY slightly wrong
2015-07-29 22:36:20	@Espyo	...somewhere
2015-07-29 22:36:23	@Espyo	I can't put my finger on it
2015-07-29 22:46:39	En_Passant	The Burrowing Snagret and the Pink Menace overlap a little bit
2015-07-29 22:46:58	@Espyo	they're kinda meant to
2015-07-29 22:47:00	@Espyo	I mean, they're pretty close
2015-07-29 22:47:18	@Espyo	unless we put the icons far apart, but they lose fidelity to their real place
2015-07-29 23:05:50	En_Passant	Is it the ship icon?
2015-07-29 23:06:20	@Espyo	what is?
2015-07-29 23:06:25	@Espyo	oh, what feels off?
2015-07-29 23:06:33	@Espyo	no, I think it's more of a general thing that's throwing me off
2015-07-29 23:06:36	@Espyo	not so much a particular icon
2015-07-29 23:11:31	En_Passant	Say, how did you make the Red Pikmin icon?
2015-07-29 23:14:10	@Espyo	shrunk version of uh... [[File:Red Pikmin.png]]?
2015-07-29 23:14:10	Testyo	"File:Red_Pikmin.png" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:Red_Pikmin.png

2015-07-29 23:15:51	En_Passant	The one with a space in it probably should be deleted, actually
2015-07-29 23:17:35	@Espyo	hm
2015-07-29 23:17:50	@Espyo	yeah, it should
2015-07-29 23:20:08	Testyo	at you mean why
2015-07-29 23:23:46	En_Passant	Should I make a Bingo Battle Icon category?
2015-07-29 23:24:02	@Espyo	hm, yeah
2015-07-29 23:26:47	En_Passant	Are those ripped or custom-made?
2015-07-29 23:27:56	@Espyo	ripped from the e-manual
2015-07-29 23:29:25	En_Passant	Last question:
2015-07-29 23:29:27	En_Passant	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Obstacle_button_templates
2015-07-29 23:29:31	En_Passant	Why do we have these?
2015-07-29 23:30:44	En_Passant	The Icon template obsoletes them
2015-07-29 23:31:06	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-29 23:31:08	@Espyo	it kinda does
2015-07-29 23:31:16	@Espyo	but they existed before the icon template
2015-07-29 23:31:21	@Espyo	anyway, they're easier to add on infoboxes
2015-07-29 23:32:28	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] Category:Bingo Battle ico... by En Passant (+77 N Created page with "Icons used in [[Bingo Battle]], ripped from the e-manual.  [[...) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Bingo_Battle_icons&curid=19228&diff=152750&oldid=0
2015-07-29 23:32:57	En_Passant	Well, they're technically easier anywhere because they're shorter.
2015-07-29 23:33:15	@Espyo	mhm
2015-07-29 23:33:19	En_Passant	But it's still redundant to have both
2015-07-29 23:33:25	@Espyo	it is
2015-07-29 23:33:28	En_Passant	Wastes a lot of storage space
2015-07-29 23:33:30	@Espyo	but I think there was a good reason

2015-07-29 23:41:05	En_Passant	Should I use that ugly clay Bulbmin artwork for a Bulbmin icon?
2015-07-29 23:42:44	@Espyo	hmm...
2015-07-29 23:42:52	@Espyo	the icons normally get an outline added to them
2015-07-29 23:42:55	@Espyo	so leave it to me
2015-07-29 23:43:03	En_Passant	All of them?
2015-07-29 23:43:04	@Espyo	just pretend the icon exists any time you need to use it
2015-07-29 23:43:15	@Espyo	Treasure Hoard and Piklopedia ones already come with an outline
2015-07-29 23:43:21	@Espyo	all custom ones I added an outline
2015-07-29 23:43:26	En_Passant	I know
2015-07-29 23:43:36	En_Passant	I was going to do it myself
2015-07-29 23:43:45	@Espyo	oh, feel free then
2015-07-29 23:43:49	En_Passant	Though I don't know how you did it
2015-07-29 23:43:55	@Espyo	GIMP
2015-07-29 23:44:03	@Espyo	steps are a bit easy, but you should know a bit how GIMP works in general
2015-07-29 23:44:40	En_Passant	Do I have to use GIMP to get it to look like what you did?
2015-07-29 23:45:00	@Espyo	not really
2015-07-29 23:46:03	En_Passant	It looks like you made the outline and them shrunk the image
2015-07-29 23:46:11	En_Passant	*then
2015-07-29 23:47:14	@Espyo	well, it's just that it's anti-aliased
2015-07-29 23:47:20	@Espyo	that's what I did for most of them, if not all
2015-07-29 23:47:25	@Espyo	but I think you can do it at a small size too
2015-07-29 23:48:44	En_Passant	How thick of an outline?
2015-07-29 23:49:09	@Espyo	 1 or 2 pixels
2015-07-29 23:49:12	@Espyo	the thing is... I never know
2015-07-29 23:49:26	@Espyo	and it's REALLY hard to tell from the Treasure Hoard/Piklopedia icons
2015-07-29 23:49:31	@Espyo	so I just pick which one looks the best
2015-07-29 23:50:03	En_Passant	I mean, before you shrunk them
2015-07-29 23:50:12	@Espyo	depends on the size of the image
2015-07-29 23:50:20	@Espyo	the final icon has to be 32x32, with 1/2 thick outline
2015-07-29 23:50:22	@Espyo	so... math required
2015-07-29 23:51:20	En_Passant	The Red Pikmin icon is 40x40
2015-07-29 23:51:28	@Espyo	is it?
2015-07-29 23:51:32	En_Passant	yes
2015-07-29 23:51:35	@Espyo	I think that icon was a bit temporary
2015-07-29 23:51:39	@Espyo	we don't have icons for any other color
2015-07-29 23:51:46	@Espyo	I did it in a rush for the main page back when we updated it
2015-07-29 23:52:51	En_Passant	Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing
2015-07-29 23:52:56	En_Passant	Making icons for the other colors
2015-07-29 23:53:07	En_Passant	I can remake the Red one too, if you want
2015-07-29 23:53:36	@Espyo	might as well
2015-07-29 23:54:49	En_Passant	So what should I use for the Bulbmin icon?
2015-07-29 23:55:05	En_Passant	It will be used on literally one page (Hidden Garden)
2015-07-29 23:55:35	En_Passant	Oh, wait, it won't be used there either
2015-07-29 23:55:47	En_Passant	Never mind then

2015-07-30 18:58:12	@PikFan	...wait, who are you asking
2015-07-30 18:58:17	Pi	both of you!
2015-07-30 18:58:22	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-30 18:58:27	@PikFan	merp
2015-07-30 18:58:35	Pi	so you are merp
2015-07-30 18:58:43	Pi	PikFan = merp
2015-07-30 18:58:44	En_Passant	It's a general question
2015-07-30 18:58:46	@PikFan	no I just said merp because merp
2015-07-30 18:58:52	@PikFan	anyway, I'm good
2015-07-30 18:58:55	@PikFan	how about you?
2015-07-30 18:59:15	Pi	I'm just fine
2015-07-30 18:59:29	Pi	albeit STILL a bit tired, because of a long walk
2015-07-30 18:59:33	@PikFan	ignoring the heat, that is
2015-07-30 18:59:50	@PikFan	my mom's phone says it's supposed to be 107F here today
2015-07-30 18:59:51	Testyo	107 F = 41.6667 °C / 314.817 K
2015-07-30 18:59:56	Pi	I had a three-hour long walk
2015-07-30 18:59:56	@PikFan	it NEVER gets that hot
2015-07-30 19:00:00	@PikFan	wow
2015-07-30 19:00:18	Pi	in the middle of it, I ate at a Chinese restaurant I randomly found
2015-07-30 19:00:29	Pi	I was like
2015-07-30 19:00:43	Pi	"oh hey it's Chinese food, haven't had that in ages"
2015-07-30 19:00:53	@PikFan	you like walk around, huh?
2015-07-30 19:01:09	Pi	yes
2015-07-30 19:01:10	Pi	I do
2015-07-30 19:01:11	Pi	a lot
2015-07-30 19:01:31	@PikFan	walks are relaxing
2015-07-30 19:01:35	Pi	mhm
2015-07-30 19:01:44	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-30 19:02:01	@PikFan	hi
2015-07-30 19:07:51	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-07-30 19:08:03	@PikFan	so I came up with a name for my new taiga area
2015-07-30 19:08:11	@PikFan	I'm going to call it the Bitterfrost Forest
2015-07-30 19:09:00	@PikFan	how does that sound?
2015-07-30 19:11:25	Pi	can't you find a more suitable word than 'Forest'?
2015-07-30 19:11:43	@PikFan	I already used "woods"
2015-07-30 19:11:46	Pi	yes
2015-07-30 19:11:49	Yoshi2	hiho Espyo & Testyo 
2015-07-30 19:11:50	Testyo	if you get a value for every game, you don't show the case of Pikmin 2, it's not in any known config file
2015-07-30 19:11:57	Yoshi2	& PikFan 
2015-07-30 19:12:02	Pi	but aren't there any words that work better for a taiga biome than 'Forest'?
2015-07-30 19:12:21	@Espyo	hey
2015-07-30 19:12:24	@PikFan	not sure
2015-07-30 19:12:34	Pi	look up a few, see which ones you like
2015-07-30 19:12:38	@Espyo	jungle, woods, bosk, I think
2015-07-30 19:12:48	Pi	bosk?
2015-07-30 19:12:50	@PikFan	again, I already used woods
2015-07-30 19:14:00	@Espyo	I think I heard bosk before
2015-07-30 19:14:43	En_Passant	Grove?
2015-07-30 19:14:46	@Espyo	that can work
2015-07-30 19:14:59	@PikFan	eh...
2015-07-30 19:15:08	@Espyo	right, you know that Chugga moment where he whistles his 100 Blues right before sunset, but they don't appear on the ending cutscene?
2015-07-30 19:15:09	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iZWjtLElo
2015-07-30 19:15:20	@PikFan	define grove: a small wood, orchard, or group of trees.
2015-07-30 19:15:39	@PikFan	you aren't going to find a cluster of trees up in the north, really
2015-07-30 19:15:58	@PikFan	maybe south
2015-07-30 19:16:17	@PikFan	so I could change it to Whispering Grove and then it would be Bitterfrost Woods
2015-07-30 19:18:05	En_Passant	It doesn't necessarily have to be in the Arctic
2015-07-30 19:18:22	En_Passant	Mountains are a thing with lots of trees
2015-07-30 19:19:25	@PikFan	I still want it to be a taiga
2015-07-30 19:19:54	En_Passant	They also have snow
2015-07-30 19:20:16	@PikFan	I know
2015-07-30 19:20:36	@PikFan	but in the end, it's going to be a taiga
2015-07-30 19:21:31	@PikFan	oh, and I came up with an idea for my beach and swamp areas
2015-07-30 19:21:37	@PikFan	they could be on a tropical island
2015-07-30 19:22:17	@PikFan	as for the grassland area, last night I discovered flooded grasslands
2015-07-30 19:23:09	@PikFan	I don't have a complete area name, but for now, it starts with "Sinking"

2015-07-30 19:24:55	En_Passant	So basically, it's a wetland
2015-07-30 19:26:04	@PikFan	kind of
2015-07-30 19:26:10	@PikFan	like
2015-07-30 19:26:18	@PikFan	I want one half of the area to be dry
2015-07-30 19:26:28	@PikFan	and the other half to be wet

2015-07-30 19:28:03	@PikFan	iirc this theme plays ONLY on Snagret Hole sublevel 4
2015-07-30 19:28:18	@PikFan	like, there is another theme that is extremely similar
2015-07-30 19:28:35	Pi	!def bosk
2015-07-30 19:28:35	BetaMaster	A small wood or thicket, especially of bushes.
2015-07-30 19:29:03	Pi	hey look, it /was/ a real word
2015-07-30 19:29:05	En_Passant	Reminder that we have an article on Pikmin 2's music
2015-07-30 19:29:13	@PikFan	I know
2015-07-30 19:29:24	@PikFan	I actually used that article to find that track
2015-07-30 19:30:07	@PikFan	but I don't think there's a track online that has the Subterranean Complex version
2015-07-30 19:32:26	En_Passant	That's because there likely isn't a special version
2015-07-30 19:32:32	@PikFan	I'm not sure why the article is saying it plays on Subterranean Complex sublevel 6 and Cavern of Chaos sublevel 1
2015-07-30 19:33:19	@PikFan	there's two different themes
2015-07-30 19:33:41	@PikFan	the theme I posted plays ONLY on Snagret Hole sublevel 6

2015-07-30 19:34:21	@PikFan	the pitch of some notes are different
2015-07-30 19:35:40	En_Passant	The theme you posted is Louie's version of the theme
2015-07-30 19:35:54	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2015-07-30 19:36:37	En_Passant	Also, the wiki says that the Snagret Hole sublevel 4 theme isn't even that one
2015-07-30 19:36:45	Pi	oh god the Subterranean Complex
2015-07-30 19:36:48	Pi	I hate that cave

2015-07-30 20:43:37	En_Passant	Should I change the theme of Dune Canyon a little bit to incorporate more water?
2015-07-30 20:44:45	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2015-07-30 20:44:53	En_Passant	I'm not sure if I should require a second return trip to the region after getting Blues/Wingeds
2015-07-30 20:44:57	@PikFan	it's desert-themed, right?
2015-07-30 20:45:21	En_Passant	More like rocky-themed
2015-07-30 20:45:30	En_Passant	There's a desert area, a mountain area, and a cave area
2015-07-30 20:45:45	@PikFan	maybe add a river or something in Rusted Ravine
2015-07-30 20:45:54	@PikFan	after all, water does rust things :P
2015-07-30 20:46:25	En_Passant	The main reason I called it that was because the rocks are red
2015-07-30 20:46:47	En_Passant	But I could make it a canyon and find another name for Dune Canyon
2015-07-30 20:46:53	En_Passant	I was thinking of doing the latter anyway
2015-07-30 20:47:30	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-30 20:48:49	En_Passant	But again, I'm undecided on making a third trip necessary
2015-07-30 20:49:34	@PikFan	misread that as "decided on making a third trip unnecessary" lol
2015-07-30 20:49:37	En_Passant	I hated how Pikmin 3's 10 Day run is only 10 days because of a couple of fruits in each area that require Wingeds/Blues
2015-07-30 20:50:04	@PikFan	hm
2015-07-30 20:50:15	@PikFan	you can't get early Blues
2015-07-30 20:50:34	@PikFan	so the game forces you to complete the main story and then go back and grab the fruits
2015-07-30 20:51:42	@PikFan	I'm thinking of having a scenario in my game where 3 new areas are opened at once
2015-07-30 20:52:03	@PikFan	and each new area has a new Pikmin type
2015-07-30 20:52:15	@PikFan	but until you complete all three areas, you can't move on
2015-07-30 20:52:28	En_Passant	Define "complete"
2015-07-30 20:52:39	En_Passant	I don't recall your game having story bosses
2015-07-30 20:52:52	@PikFan	complete wasn't the right word
2015-07-30 20:53:28	@PikFan	there's signals in my game
2015-07-30 20:53:32	@PikFan	like P3 
2015-07-30 20:53:45	En_Passant	I see
2015-07-30 20:54:32	En_Passant	I think you could, then, though my idea of what the story would be like is flawed
2015-07-30 20:58:24	@PikFan	the signals are coming from his treasure-gathering bases on the planet
2015-07-30 20:58:40	@PikFan	and you want to reduce his influence on the planet
2015-07-30 20:58:57	@PikFan	...at this point I think I might need to change my game's name
2015-07-30 20:59:13	@PikFan	it's far too long, and doesn't really have anything to do with the plot
2015-07-30 20:59:29	@PikFan	it was just something I came up with ages ago and it's stuck since then
2015-07-30 21:00:42	Yoshi2	yup, too long names aren't very good
2015-07-30 21:00:46	@PikFan	like, if there was actually a connection of the worlds, there would be like cities
2015-07-30 21:00:53	@PikFan	but there aren't any
2015-07-30 21:01:05	@PikFan	so the title is pretty pointless
2015-07-30 21:01:50	@PikFan	although, if I did change the game name, then I'd have to do something about the boxart, too
2015-07-30 21:02:01	En_Passant	That's why I chose a simple title
2015-07-30 21:02:02	@PikFan	I didn't make it, my friend did
2015-07-30 21:02:11	@PikFan	and I have no experience in image editing
2015-07-30 21:04:44	@PikFan	I want to change it to something that includes "ambition"
2015-07-30 21:04:53	@PikFan	other than that, I haven't any ideas

2015-07-30 21:10:36	@PikFan	...when I was 11
2015-07-30 21:10:56	@PikFan	and now I'm 15
2015-07-30 21:11:42	@PikFan	say, En_Passant, how old are you?
2015-07-30 21:11:52	En_Passant	Almost 18
2015-07-30 21:11:58	@PikFan	ah
2015-07-30 21:12:11	En_Passant	So I am, in fact, a minor
2015-07-30 21:12:24	@PikFan	but you're almost not a minor
2015-07-30 21:12:35	En_Passant	Almost
2015-07-30 21:12:36	@PikFan	on your userpage, when it said you're a minor, I thought like 15 or 16
2015-07-30 21:12:47	En_Passant	But that only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
2015-07-30 21:12:53	En_Passant	I was, when I made that page
2015-07-30 21:13:04	@PikFan	oh
2015-07-30 21:13:14	En_Passant	But I wasn't active here for a long time after that
2015-07-30 21:13:55	@PikFan	I love how it says it's just me http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/pikminfanon.com
2015-07-30 21:14:01	@PikFan	and then I get a fatal error
2015-07-30 21:14:12	En_Passant	Me too
2015-07-30 21:15:41	Yoshi2	I guess the way it checks if a website is down is flawed
2015-07-30 21:17:29	Yoshi2	well, technically the website is up
2015-07-30 21:17:36	@PikFan	it is
2015-07-30 21:17:51	En_Passant	lol
2015-07-30 21:17:57	En_Passant	I'm watching someone streaming Pikmin
2015-07-30 21:17:58	@PikFan	En_Passant: you should've seen my original username, ugh
2015-07-30 21:18:06	@PikFan	it was so ugly
2015-07-30 21:18:17	En_Passant	And one of his mods starts posting links to the Pikmin Fanon Wikia
2015-07-30 21:18:23	@PikFan	:|
2015-07-30 21:18:25	Yoshi2	my first username was Luigi 
2015-07-30 21:18:34	Yoshi2	in some nintendo fan forum
2015-07-30 21:18:42	@PikFan	where can I find this traitor
2015-07-30 21:20:22	@PikFan	it doesn't matter anyway

2015-07-30 21:20:33	@PikFan	in the last 60 days, there's only been 10 edits
2015-07-30 21:21:25	En_Passant	I'm going to post my own and see what happens
2015-07-30 21:22:38	@PikFan	I'd livestream
2015-07-30 21:22:43	@PikFan	one problem:
2015-07-30 21:22:56	@PikFan	I don't have a capture card
2015-07-30 21:23:06	En_Passant	Me too
2015-07-30 21:23:35	@PikFan	also if I did a livestream, I probably wouldn't talk, considering I have a horrible voice
2015-07-30 21:24:36	Yoshi2	how so?
2015-07-30 21:24:51	@PikFan	it's just really, really high pitched for a teenaged boy
2015-07-30 21:24:59	@PikFan	I also have a lisp and a stutter
2015-07-30 21:26:05	@PikFan	the lisp isn't that bad, but sometimes I stutter when I talk

2015-07-30 21:28:52	@PikFan	oh, I see
2015-07-30 21:28:56	Yoshi2	well, it's worth trying to do something like a livestream just to see how you'd sound
2015-07-30 21:28:58	@PikFan	the legs are further apart
2015-07-30 21:29:09	@PikFan	I've recorded myself before
2015-07-30 21:29:13	@PikFan	and I don't like it
2015-07-30 21:29:59	Yoshi2	mhm
2015-07-30 21:30:13	Yoshi2	I've tried to do some LPs
2015-07-30 21:30:32	Yoshi2	it was... okay, but my recording equipment was poor
2015-07-30 21:32:23	En_Passant	This guy doesn't seem to realize that I self-advertised
2015-07-30 21:32:40	En_Passant	His chat hasn't commented on it either
2015-07-30 21:33:17	@PikFan	wait what did you sat
2015-07-30 21:33:20	@PikFan	*say
2015-07-30 21:34:03	En_Passant	I asked if he wanted to see a good one, and then posted the link
2015-07-30 21:34:19	@PikFan	good one of what?
2015-07-30 21:34:55	En_Passant	They were posting links in chat because of how atrocious the quality is
2015-07-30 21:35:03	En_Passant	So I played along
2015-07-30 21:35:07	@PikFan	oh lol
2015-07-30 21:35:44	@PikFan	it looks like he just killed the Bulblax
2015-07-30 21:36:07	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-07-30 21:36:18	En_Passant	Someone posted Attack of the Breadbugs

2015-07-30 22:11:10	Klemen702	allthrough, a thing i don't get about the stragety he used, isn't that supposed to be for the length of the throw and not the height?
2015-07-30 22:11:41	En_Passant	Isn't what supposed to be for length?

2015-07-30 22:13:00	Klemen702	it looked like he did it
2015-07-30 22:13:07	En_Passant	And the height is only gained through the length

2015-07-30 22:13:55	En_Passant	The Pikmin has enough momentum that the game has to slide it up the trunk to reach the intended distance

2015-07-30 22:17:17	Klemen702	is that thing under the ship the ''sheding skin' that is on the empress bulblax page?
2015-07-30 22:20:07	En_Passant	I think so

2015-07-31 19:37:23	Pi	hey Espyo, how's it going with that P3 unused material?
2015-07-31 19:37:30	Pi	have you found something else that's neat?

2015-07-31 19:37:51	@Espyo	and the half we had has pretty much been explored
2015-07-31 19:37:55	@Espyo	I mean, we have raw numbers for enemies
2015-07-31 19:37:59	@Espyo	like health, how fast they move, etc.
2015-07-31 19:38:04	@Espyo	I'll add that to the wiki in some days

2015-07-31 19:43:28	Yoshi2	I'm a bit happier with how the sarc extractor script looks after I fixed some of the style issues it had

2015-07-31 19:49:43	En_Passant	Espyo, isn't the Giant Breadbug's music technically cave music and not its boss theme?
2015-07-31 19:49:54	@Espyo	yep
2015-07-31 19:50:06	@Espyo	Yoshi2: yeah
2015-07-31 19:51:19	Klemen702	technicly?
2015-07-31 19:51:49	Klemen702	shoudn't it count as boss music same with titan dweevil?
2015-07-31 19:51:49	En_Passant	Yeah, the playing of the music has nothing to do with the Giant Breadbug
2015-07-31 19:51:57	Klemen702	oh 
2015-07-31 19:52:18	Klemen702	how can one confirm that tho
2015-07-31 19:53:01	Yoshi2	does that mean the music would still play if the boss wasn't there?
2015-07-31 19:53:07	En_Passant	I think so
2015-07-31 19:53:20	En_Passant	I'll go find a video
2015-07-31 19:53:55	Klemen702	it still does?
2015-07-31 19:54:17	Klemen702	if so what should it be counted as?
2015-07-31 19:54:23	Yoshi2	but if the music only plays in the room with the boss, wouldn't it still count as a boss theme?
2015-07-31 19:56:17	@Espyo	I suppose we could remove it from the infobo
2015-07-31 19:56:19	@Espyo	*x

2015-07-31 19:56:35	@Espyo	all agree?
2015-07-31 19:56:47	@Espyo	Yoshi2: the music stays even after the boss is dead and all
2015-07-31 19:57:00	@Espyo	and I believe that when you fight that boss on Challenge Mode, that song doesn't play
2015-07-31 19:57:21	Klemen702	i asked earlier, what should be counted as if it is not boss music?
2015-07-31 19:57:28	Klemen702	cave music?
2015-07-31 19:57:52	En_Passant	No, it does, Espyo, and yes, Klemen

2015-07-31 20:25:55	En_Passant	Clicking on the second one works, though
2015-07-31 20:25:58	@Espyo	maybe it should be centered by the body

2015-07-31 20:36:20	En_Passant	So it's fine at 40x40?

2015-07-31 20:52:15	@Espyo	that's also why I was so eager to get rid of them
2015-07-31 21:13:38	Klemen702	dammit
2015-07-31 21:13:50	Klemen702	why does paint have to make everything i screenshot so blurry?
2015-07-31 21:19:37	Yoshi2	Klemen702: are you saving the image as jpg?
2015-07-31 21:20:13	Klemen702	well
2015-07-31 21:20:24	Yoshi2	though that doesn't make the image blurry, just overall lower quality because of artifacts

2015-07-31 21:20:40	Klemen702	i am not actually screenshoting, i copied the image and pasted it in paint

2015-07-31 21:21:12	Yoshi2	I thought so much
2015-07-31 21:21:55	Klemen702	?
2015-07-31 21:23:24	Yoshi2	well, ms paint doesn't have a good reputation, so you might want to install a real program for editing images
2015-07-31 21:23:48	Klemen702	i'll try to find one
2015-07-31 21:23:52	Yoshi2	I'd recommend paint.net

2015-07-31 21:50:35	Klemen702	absolutely nothing to do, allthrough it is night
2015-07-31 21:52:44	Pi	This is when you go to bed.
2015-07-31 21:52:54	Klemen702	probably should
2015-07-31 21:52:56	Pi	It's what you do when you are bored and it is nighttime.
2015-07-31 21:53:15	Klemen702	thing is i have to wait for others to shower

2015-07-31 21:56:09	Klemen702	no i mean when i am in bed
2015-07-31 21:56:21	Pi	you are currently looking at one though

2015-07-31 23:01:49	@Espyo	hi
2015-07-31 23:01:50	libotoa	Anyone on?
2015-07-31 23:01:54	libotoa	Oh hi
2015-07-31 23:02:02	libotoa	So anyway I came to ask a question
2015-07-31 23:02:03	@Espyo	I was busy drawing
2015-07-31 23:02:08	@Espyo	sure, go ahead
2015-07-31 23:02:56	libotoa	In pikmin, I left an area for a couple days and when I came back, all the tadpoles became wollywogs and mini bulb orbs into large bulb orbs and bulbears.
2015-07-31 23:03:23	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-31 23:03:27	libotoa	It kinda confused me because aren't mini bulborbs and the normal ones unrelated?
2015-07-31 23:03:34	@Espyo	they are unrelated
2015-07-31 23:03:38	@Espyo	is it The Distant Spring?
2015-07-31 23:03:43	libotoa	Didn't know they grew up too
2015-07-31 23:03:44	@Espyo	because some areas get NEW enemies after some days pass
2015-07-31 23:03:53	libotoa	Pretty wierd, huh?
2015-07-31 23:04:03	@Espyo	a bit, but there's probably an explanation
2015-07-31 23:04:04	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-31 23:04:16	libotoa	Yeah but I mean like, all the larvae versions of creatures like, grew up.
2015-07-31 23:04:26	@Espyo	what area was it?
2015-07-31 23:04:33	libotoa	Forest of hope.
2015-07-31 23:04:50	libotoa	I noticed because the tadpoles in the largest pond were all replaced.
2015-07-31 23:05:03	@Espyo	hmm
2015-07-31 23:05:11	@Espyo	I think Wogpoles disappear for good once they're gone
2015-07-31 23:05:17	@Espyo	I mean, once you kill them once
2015-07-31 23:05:33	@Espyo	and according to the wiki, you get more Bulborbs after day 5
2015-07-31 23:05:49	libotoa	Oh. Maybe that was it.
2015-07-31 23:05:53	@Espyo	I never really heard of creatures growing up, so that was probably it
2015-07-31 23:05:58	@Espyo	still, pretty wacky
2015-07-31 23:06:02	libotoa	It would be cool if they grew after a few days though.
2015-07-31 23:06:09	@Espyo	it really would

2015-08-01 20:29:02	UltraMario	hey Espyo
2015-08-01 20:29:09	UltraMario	i need some help on Inkipedia
2015-08-01 20:29:20	UltraMario	mind helping me? :p
2015-08-01 20:35:47	@Espyo	sure
2015-08-01 20:36:11	UltraMario	do you know how to change the color of text?
2015-08-01 20:36:54	UltraMario	cuz like the in-game description for Splat Zones highlights certain words in orange and I wanted to emulate that by coloring the font
2015-08-01 20:37:10	UltraMario	do you think that's a good idea?
2015-08-01 20:38:07	UltraMario	i know there's something called Template:Color but I have no clue how to use it
2015-08-01 20:38:36	UltraMario	help would be appreciated. :D
2015-08-01 20:38:41	 *	UltraMario waits patiently
2015-08-01 20:40:53	UltraMario	if you're busy i understand, i can wait. :)
2015-08-01 20:41:31	@Espyo	I think it's just {{color|orange|bla bla bla}}
2015-08-01 20:41:31	Testyo	"color|orange|bla_bla_bla" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:color|orange|bla_bla_bla
2015-08-01 20:41:36	UltraMario	oh
2015-08-01 20:41:37	@Espyo	or if not, {{color|bla bla bla|orange}}
2015-08-01 20:41:37	Testyo	"color|bla_bla_bla|orange" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:color|bla_bla_bla|orange
2015-08-01 20:41:43	UltraMario	that seems easy
2015-08-01 20:41:59	UltraMario	cuz the template didn't say anything about how to use it
2015-08-01 20:42:29	UltraMario	also wait Espyo do you think it's okay to color the font like it is in game?
2015-08-01 20:42:56	@Espyo	we do it on Pikipedia
2015-08-01 20:43:06	@Espyo	if you think it looks ugly, bring it to the talk page
2015-08-01 20:43:08	@Espyo	but if not, go ahead
2015-08-01 20:43:37	UltraMario	ok

2015-08-01 21:57:49	UltraMario	hey Espyo
2015-08-01 21:58:35	UltraMario	i finished the description but the text was worded differently. im not sure if that's a pal description or it's just mistyped, im guessing the former.
2015-08-01 21:58:38	UltraMario	http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splat_Zones#In-game_Info
2015-08-01 21:58:57	UltraMario	Splatoon seems to have a lot of PAL text changes
2015-08-01 21:59:22	UltraMario	if it is indeed a PAL version of the description you should add it back
2015-08-01 21:59:58	UltraMario	how does it look, Espyo? The orange is a little brighter than in-game, but other than that I think it looks alright.
2015-08-01 22:00:54	@Espyo	hmm
2015-08-01 22:01:02	@Espyo	well, I can't know without checking
2015-08-01 22:01:17	@Espyo	yeah, looks good
2015-08-01 22:02:02	UltraMario	yay
2015-08-01 22:02:44	UltraMario	i added that in my edit summary that i wasn't sure if it was pal or not. if it is, add it back and keep this version
2015-08-01 22:03:08	UltraMario	also damn it took forever to do that. Wii U editing is slow
2015-08-01 22:03:47	UltraMario	i mean my brother is not home, so i could use his computer, but the thing is that all the text i needed to copy was on the tv
2015-08-01 22:05:02	@Espyo	right
2015-08-01 22:05:30	UltraMario	i can't wait till either my laptop gets eventually fixed or i get my school laptop
2015-08-01 22:07:04	Testyo	lol capsule

2015-08-04 19:02:49	En_Passant	Is there any particular reason why our Challenge/Mission Modes/Bingo Battle categories are strangely organized?
2015-08-04 19:08:26	UltraMario	hi
2015-08-04 19:28:06	En_Passant	So Bingo Battle has its locations as a sub-category
2015-08-04 19:28:11	En_Passant	But the other modes don't
2015-08-04 19:28:59	En_Passant	They have the article pages in their location category (which is separate), and then sub-categories for all of the locations in the main category
2015-08-04 19:29:03	En_Passant	All of which are empty
2015-08-04 20:07:55	En_Passant	J, any input on what should be done?

2015-08-04 20:22:31	En_Passant	Should we keep the categories for each stage?
2015-08-04 20:22:48	Yoshi2	this is getting ridiculous, I'll go check what other servers darkmyst has

2015-08-04 20:31:38	Yoshi2	alright, this is a bit silly
2015-08-04 20:31:57	En_Passant	Should we even have the location categories, then? They can easily be put on the main categories
2015-08-04 20:32:07	Yoshi2	darkmyst has like 1 server in Europe that supports IPv6, and one server in the USA that supports IPv6
2015-08-04 20:32:09	En_Passant	Those would have only a few entries without them

2015-08-04 20:35:18	@PikFan	hi
2015-08-04 20:35:38	@PikFan	so for the P3 area navboxes, shouldn't we be including minibosses?
2015-08-04 20:35:48	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-04 20:35:57	@Espyo	on the map only
2015-08-04 20:35:59	Yoshi2	hey PikFan 
2015-08-04 20:36:03	@Espyo	so the actual list doesn't get clogged
2015-08-04 20:36:06	@Espyo	thing about the map is...
2015-08-04 20:36:10	@Espyo	we barely have decent maps to begin with
2015-08-04 20:36:14	@Espyo	most or taken from prima
2015-08-04 20:36:17	@Espyo	some have legends
2015-08-04 20:36:20	@Espyo	others have incomplete legends
2015-08-04 20:36:23	@Espyo	others have no legend
2015-08-04 20:36:28	@Espyo	so first, let's focus on having GOOD MAPS
2015-08-04 20:36:48	@PikFan	I haven't gotten around to stitching together some maps
2015-08-04 20:36:52	@Espyo	then, we still need to reorganize the sections of the map so that they're packed to fit on the navbox without the size being tiny
2015-08-04 20:37:09	UltraMario	hi pikfan
2015-08-04 20:37:16	UltraMario	im making a list of forgotten ac characters
2015-08-04 20:37:22	@PikFan	cool
2015-08-04 20:37:32	UltraMario	since happy home designer is coming pretty soon
2015-08-04 20:37:38	@PikFan	right
2015-08-04 20:37:42	UltraMario	someone ripped the sprites from achhh
2015-08-04 20:37:48	UltraMario	http://www.spriters-resource.com/resources/sheets/65/68338.png
2015-08-04 20:37:53	UltraMario	THAT'S A LOT OF CHARACTERS
2015-08-04 20:38:11	@PikFan	Espyo: maybe I can take a bunch of pictures of the areas and send them to you so you can put them together
2015-08-04 20:38:15	UltraMario	some characters that haven't appeared since their debut appear in this spritesheet, which i'll also put in the list
2015-08-04 20:38:17	En_Passant	Doesn't look like any more than in any other AC game
2015-08-04 20:38:29	@PikFan	I bet that you'll put them together a lot faster than me
2015-08-04 20:38:33	@Espyo	can do
2015-08-04 20:38:35	UltraMario	415
2015-08-04 20:38:39	@Espyo	wait, like overview?
2015-08-04 20:38:43	@Espyo	like I did for the P1 maps?
2015-08-04 20:39:19	@PikFan	kind of
2015-08-04 20:39:44	@PikFan	I mean like this http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/6/64/Silver_Lake_treasures_map.png
2015-08-04 20:39:55	@PikFan	minus all the fruits, obstacles, etc

2015-08-04 20:40:06	@Espyo	sure, do it, please

2015-08-04 20:43:59	@Espyo	oh yeah
2015-08-04 20:47:26	En_Passant	Should we get rid of the 2-Player/Challenge/Mission Mode Location categories?
2015-08-04 20:47:55	@Espyo	they make sense
2015-08-04 20:47:58	@Espyo	to exist
2015-08-04 20:48:07	@Espyo	would it really be better to have it all dumped onto the same category?
2015-08-04 20:48:17	En_Passant	Probably
2015-08-04 20:48:29	En_Passant	The main categories would have only a couple of entries otherwise

2015-08-04 20:50:36	@Espyo	I suppose
2015-08-04 20:51:43	@PikFan	I don't see why we can't make a category that has the 2-Player/Challenge/Mission Mode Location categories as subcategories
2015-08-04 20:52:16	@PikFan	like... Alternate Game Mode Locations

2015-08-04 23:44:48	@PikFan	I listened to all of them, and in every one, there's a ringing sound at the beginning
2015-08-04 23:45:01	@Espyo	hm
2015-08-04 23:45:20	@PikFan	I wonder if he does it manually or the notation software forces it
2015-08-04 23:47:24	@Espyo	yeah...
2015-08-04 23:47:43	@PikFan	well, I asked on one of his videos
2015-08-04 23:48:03	@PikFan	oh yeah, I forgot to say that I made a YT account
2015-08-04 23:48:11	@PikFan	same username
2015-08-04 23:48:59	@PikFan	oh, when's the next community spotlight video coming out?
2015-08-04 23:49:17	@Espyo	neat
2015-08-04 23:49:23	@Espyo	it's pretty much "when it's done"
2015-08-04 23:49:41	@PikFan	let me guess
2015-08-04 23:49:44	@PikFan	it's not done
2015-08-04 23:49:50	@Espyo	probably not
2015-08-04 23:49:56	@PikFan	heh
2015-08-04 23:50:15	@PikFan	oh well
2015-08-04 23:52:00	@PikFan	I still don't understand why they like to use Skype
2015-08-04 23:52:14	@Espyo	well, we're on a skype call right now
2015-08-04 23:52:16	@Espyo	me included
2015-08-04 23:52:19	@Espyo	so... stuff like that
2015-08-04 23:52:20	@PikFan	it's too cumbersome imo
2015-08-04 23:52:49	@Espyo	it is
2015-08-04 23:52:50	@PikFan	IRC is much more simple
2015-08-04 23:53:22	@PikFan	I'm not making a microsoft account just to use skype, screw that
2015-08-04 23:55:42	@PikFan	skype account...?
2015-08-04 23:55:47	@PikFan	hmmmmmm
2015-08-04 23:55:50	@Espyo	yeah, they're kinda hybrids
2015-08-04 23:55:51	@Espyo	the accounts
2015-08-04 23:56:07	En_Passant	I should get a Skype
2015-08-04 23:56:08	@PikFan	meh, I guess I'll make a skype account
2015-08-04 23:56:18	@PikFan	I'm just glad I made my own gmail
2015-08-04 23:56:33	@Espyo	is there any Pik3 enemy that appears only after a certain day?
2015-08-04 23:57:12	@PikFan	hm...
2015-08-04 23:57:15	@Espyo	oh, a burgeoning spiderwort on GoH appears every 3 days, according to the wiki
2015-08-04 23:57:18	@Espyo	that should work for what I need
2015-08-04 23:57:34	@PikFan	I'm not sure about that
2015-08-04 23:57:44	En_Passant	I think another BS appears where some tiles used to be in Distant Tundra
2015-08-04 23:57:45	@PikFan	I thought it only appeared for one day and then vanished
2015-08-04 23:57:48	En_Passant	Not sure after how long
2015-08-04 23:58:00	@PikFan	the day after the fragments are cleared
2015-08-04 23:58:10	En_Passant	Also, Mireclops Pellet Posies
2015-08-04 23:58:36	@PikFan	the Sandbelching Meerslug, too
2015-08-05 00:01:39	@PikFan	anyway... I made a skype account
2015-08-05 00:01:46	@PikFan	Espyo, what's the group's name?
2015-08-05 00:02:26	@Espyo	invite only, one sec
2015-08-05 00:02:31	@PikFan	oh
2015-08-05 00:02:42	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-08-05 00:02:50	@Espyo	you'll have to add one of us as friends, and then we add you to the call
2015-08-05 00:02:53	@Espyo	which speaking of, just died
2015-08-05 00:03:06	@PikFan	wait what
2015-08-05 00:03:13	@Espyo	the call ended
2015-08-05 00:03:15	@Espyo	voice call, I mean
2015-08-05 00:03:21	@Espyo	it was only me and Josh, and he had to go to bed
2015-08-05 00:03:24	@Espyo	and I'm following suit
2015-08-05 00:03:25	@Espyo	so the call ended
2015-08-05 00:03:29	@PikFan	oh
2015-08-05 00:03:38	@Espyo	well, guess you should add me as a friend
2015-08-05 00:03:41	@Espyo	and then I'll add you to the call
2015-08-05 00:03:48	@Espyo	*add you to the group
2015-08-05 00:03:52	@PikFan	okay how do I find you
2015-08-05 00:03:52	@Espyo	warning: every day they type a LOT of stuff
2015-08-05 00:04:00	@Espyo	so expect to see 500+ unread messages
2015-08-05 00:04:06	@PikFan	oh boy
2015-08-05 00:04:07	@Espyo	on the sidebar to the left
2015-08-05 00:04:08	@Espyo	at the top
2015-08-05 00:04:11	@Espyo	there should be a search box
2015-08-05 00:04:15	@Espyo	try "andreluis.g.silva"
2015-08-05 00:04:37	@Espyo	actually
2015-08-05 00:04:41	@Espyo	search for "espyopt" instead
2015-08-05 00:04:48	@Espyo	the previous search might take you to the "old" account
2015-08-05 00:04:52	@Espyo	...it's complicated
2015-08-05 00:04:57	@Espyo	microsoft vs skype account shenanigans
2015-08-05 00:05:12	@PikFan	added
2015-08-05 00:05:47	@Espyo	hm, you show up as offline
2015-08-05 00:05:53	@PikFan	odd
2015-08-05 00:06:03	@PikFan	I am using the web version, so...
2015-08-05 00:06:10	@Espyo	oh, that might be why
2015-08-05 00:06:58	@PikFan	I know that I can't use the program, because you can only use the microsoft account on it, which is ridiculous
2015-08-05 00:08:38	@Espyo	that doesn't sound quite right
2015-08-05 00:09:04	@Espyo	can you see what I type to you?
2015-08-05 00:09:24	@PikFan	yeah
2015-08-05 00:10:32	@PikFan	I don't know what a <b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">shrug</b> is
2015-08-05 00:10:37	@Espyo	...
2015-08-05 00:10:44	@Espyo	I did *shrug*
2015-08-05 00:10:52	@Espyo	but on the latest version of skype that gets converted to bold
2015-08-05 00:10:52	@PikFan	OH
2015-08-05 00:10:59	@Espyo	but of COURSE they wouldn't take into account the web version
2015-08-05 00:11:23	@PikFan	blech
2015-08-05 00:11:38	@PikFan	I was too focused on the code to realized that you'd typed shrug
2015-08-05 00:12:00	@PikFan	*to realized
2015-08-05 00:12:02	@PikFan	...
2015-08-05 00:12:08	@PikFan	**to realize
2015-08-05 00:12:10	@PikFan	gah
2015-08-05 00:12:49	@Espyo	you should be added now
2015-08-05 00:13:12	@PikFan	I don't see anything yet
2015-08-05 00:13:18	@PikFan	it must be lagging
2015-08-05 00:13:32	 *	@PikFan refreshes
2015-08-05 00:13:32	@Espyo	maybe
2015-08-05 00:13:38	@Espyo	the others saw you being added too
2015-08-05 00:14:08	@Espyo	well, there's nothing else I can do
2015-08-05 00:14:10	@Espyo	and I really have to go
2015-08-05 00:14:14	@Espyo	so goodnight
2015-08-05 00:14:20	<--	Testyo (Testyo@89.152.yos.pwz) has quit (Quit: So long everyone!)
2015-08-05 00:14:21	@PikFan	okay, we'll do this tomorrow
2015-08-05 00:14:22	@PikFan	night
2015-08-05 00:14:28	<--	Espyo (Espyo@89.152.yos.pwz) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-08-05 00:14:39	En_Passant	He didn't add me :(
2015-08-05 00:15:14	@PikFan	okay, I sent a memo to Espyo
2015-08-05 00:15:24	@PikFan	hopefully he reads it tomorrow
2015-08-05 00:21:42	En_Passant	What do you think of Pikmin Forever?
2015-08-05 00:21:59	@PikFan	it's quite detailed
2015-08-05 00:22:12	@PikFan	I especially like the plot
2015-08-05 00:22:19	@PikFan	it's so... Pikmin-like
2015-08-05 00:22:46	En_Passant	I can't say I like the big reveal at all
2015-08-05 00:22:49	@PikFan	it doesn't involve supernatural forces or anything crazy like that
2015-08-05 00:22:58	@PikFan	big reveal?
2015-08-05 00:23:05	En_Passant	The true purpose of the Onions
2015-08-05 00:23:09	@PikFan	oh
2015-08-05 00:23:15	@PikFan	how come?
2015-08-05 00:23:50	En_Passant	It's scientifically impossible in many different ways
2015-08-05 00:24:38	@PikFan	that argument could be applied to basically all of the scifi shows, games, etc
2015-08-05 00:26:38	En_Passant	They can get away with saying it's technology from the future that we haven't discovered yet
2015-08-05 00:27:22	En_Passant	Growing a planet defies some pretty rudimentary physics
2015-08-05 00:27:23	@PikFan	but what if time travel or superluminal travel really is impossible
2015-08-05 00:27:47	@PikFan	oh, I see what you mean now
2015-08-05 00:28:29	@PikFan	other than accumulating asteroids and such, I don't see how a planetoid could grow into a planet by itself
2015-08-05 00:28:46	En_Passant	That's how we believe most planets to have formed
2015-08-05 00:29:58	@PikFan	hmm
2015-08-05 00:30:12	En_Passant	There are more problems beyond the possibility of growing a planet anyway
2015-08-05 00:30:17	En_Passant	Like resource consumption
2015-08-05 00:30:28	@PikFan	yeah
2015-08-05 00:31:27	En_Passant	And how a planet's gravity could potentially knock Earth off its orbit and destroy all life
2015-08-05 00:32:21	@PikFan	<b raw_pre="*" raw_post="*">shrug</b>
2015-08-05 00:32:23	@PikFan	oops
2015-08-05 00:32:29	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfBSc6e7QQ
2015-08-05 00:32:29	En_Passant	And also, why would the Onions be set up so their own servants are at the bottom of the food chain?
2015-08-05 00:33:02	@PikFan	it's inconceivable where Earth would be getting all that mass
2015-08-05 00:33:20	@PikFan	he claims it comes from pair-production, but afaik that only happens near black holes
2015-08-05 00:33:51	@PikFan	"Positrons cannot be Anti-matter. There is NO SUCH THING as Anti-matter, or to put it another way, in a Positron Universe Electrons are the Anti-matter. ,.......NOR do they ANNIHILATE. That would be physically impossible. Nothing can be destroyed (annihilated.) What they do is RE=JOIN. into a complete field charge!"
2015-08-05 00:34:01	@PikFan	this guy is beyond stupid
2015-08-05 00:34:21	@PikFan	antimatter is just matter with the opposite charge
2015-08-05 00:37:52	En_Passant	In other news, Splatoon has a Minigun now
2015-08-05 00:38:08	@PikFan	ah, the August update is out?
2015-08-05 00:38:12	@PikFan	nice
2015-08-05 00:38:48	@PikFan	"It's always interesting to hear someone declare supposition as assumed FACT."
2015-08-05 00:38:53	@PikFan	it is fact :|
2015-08-05 01:16:28	En_Passant	You know what's funny? We have all of these advancements in data storage, but it's still impossible to copy more than one thing at once
2015-08-05 01:16:46	@PikFan	yeah
2015-08-05 01:16:53	@PikFan	what were you trying to copy?
2015-08-05 01:18:47	En_Passant	I'm making small edits to Challenge Mode things
2015-08-05 01:19:15	En_Passant	There are two things I'm changing that are mostly the same across all of them

2015-08-05 21:40:54	@PikFan	hmm, so on skype, I'm not seeing the group
2015-08-05 21:41:09	@PikFan	maybe the web version doesn't show groups...?
2015-08-05 21:44:56	Pi	Wait, there's a Pikipedia Skype group?
2015-08-05 21:45:01	@PikFan	yeah
2015-08-05 21:45:12	@PikFan	the Pikmin Wiki folk
2015-08-05 21:45:31	@PikFan	for whatever reason they like to use skype instead of IRC
2015-08-05 21:54:14	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-05 21:54:18	@Espyo	it might not

2015-08-05 21:54:26	Pi	can you invite me

2015-08-05 21:54:40	Pi	my skype id is randomyoshi314
2015-08-05 21:54:42	@Espyo	I'm not sure if you can fit, Pi
2015-08-05 21:54:49	Pi	oh okay
2015-08-05 21:54:56	Pi	it's fine
2015-08-05 21:55:21	@PikFan	remove me so you can add Pi
2015-08-05 21:55:33	@PikFan	I can't get into the group anyway
2015-08-05 21:55:48	@PikFan	wait, what's the group name called?
2015-08-05 21:55:55	@Espyo	"Pikipedia Chat"
2015-08-05 22:03:00	@PikFan	well, this isn't helping https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10042/what-are-chat-commands-and-roles
2015-08-05 22:03:08	@Espyo	heh
2015-08-05 22:03:24	@PikFan	what kind of chat is the Pikipedia Chat?
2015-08-05 22:03:58	@PikFan	because apparently only cloud-based chats are in the web version
2015-08-05 22:04:21	@PikFan	so I'm assuming that the Pikipedia Chat is a P2P chat
2015-08-05 22:05:19	@Espyo	uh... I think there's only one type of chat
2015-08-05 22:05:27	@Espyo	but likely P2P, yeah
2015-08-05 22:05:32	@PikFan	crud
2015-08-05 22:06:05	@PikFan	so that's why I'm not seeing it

2015-08-07 14:29:45	Yoshi2	until we kept being matched against japanese players who were far better than us
2015-08-07 14:29:48	Shard1	Yeah, until you start losing. 
2015-08-07 14:29:55	Shard1	I know just how it feels
2015-08-07 14:30:18	Yoshi2	doesn't help that we were 3 and sometimes matched against 4
2015-08-07 14:30:32	Shard1	I'm currently a B+ and that was exactly how me and my friends were doing it
2015-08-07 14:30:54	Shard1	There was this one japanese player that had almost all of their abilities Run Speed Up
2015-08-07 14:31:32	Yoshi2	I don't even mind losing, but pls have mercy
2015-08-07 14:31:52	Yoshi2	we were absolutely wrecked
2015-08-07 14:32:06	Shard1	Those japanese are far too good, hopefully you don't get stuck with the Run Speed Up person
2015-08-07 14:34:01	Shard1	But Splatlings and Buckets work together very well
2015-08-07 14:37:23	Yoshi2	they're pretty nice
2015-08-07 14:37:48	Yoshi2	but I wish I had a Splatling with a different Secondary and a different Special
2015-08-07 14:38:19	Shard1	I like the Inkstrike, but the slosher is overpowered
2015-08-07 14:44:05	Yoshi2	the bucket is very interesting because of the secondary
2015-08-07 14:44:22	Yoshi2	you can throw two or three bombs that explode on impact
2015-08-07 14:44:32	Yoshi2	before having to refill
2015-08-07 14:46:45	Shard1	I find them annoying to deal with
2015-08-07 14:53:12	Yoshi2	I've tried the aerospray again, and didn't have much success with it
2015-08-07 14:53:22	Yoshi2	the bucket is better in almost every way
2015-08-07 14:53:35	Shard1	I'm really good with an Aerospray RG, but the bucket is just, guh
2015-08-07 14:57:44	Yoshi2	the aerospray seems to be less effective in ranked play
2015-08-07 15:00:09	Shard1	Aerosprays are essentially just for covering turf, but in ranked you need something with more power
2015-08-07 15:01:56	Yoshi2	yup
2015-08-07 15:06:22	Shard1	.52 and .96 gal decos are both good for ranked

2015-08-11 22:27:21	Ultimate	Random thought: they should make a pixel art app for 3DS. (Like Pixle Paint on the Wii U.)
2015-08-11 22:27:27	MS	I try to emulate that accent and do it online on Smash.
2015-08-11 22:27:40	MS	Ugh, bro. Game notes!

2015-08-14 22:04:36	@Espyo	and then revert
2015-08-14 22:04:40	@Espyo	to see if that clears it

2015-08-15 13:19:41	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-15 13:19:51	Pidgeotto	I stayed up until 6 AM yesterday, yay
2015-08-15 13:19:59	@Espyo	yikes
2015-08-15 13:20:02	@Espyo	meanwhile I slept 13 hours
2015-08-15 13:20:13	Pidgeotto	it was for a special occasion, though
2015-08-15 13:20:30	Pidgeotto	the occasion was the mario awards
2015-08-15 13:21:45	Pidgeotto	and so I had a thing I needed to post at 04:30 local time
2015-08-15 13:22:50	@Espyo	oh, neat
2015-08-15 13:33:00	Pidgeotto	it's always the biggest thing though
2015-08-15 13:33:19	Pidgeotto	like, it started 21:00 local time, and it ended 04:35 local time
2015-08-15 13:33:26	@Espyo	hmm
2015-08-15 13:33:57	Pidgeotto	and there used to be drama about it and such, but that is no longer the case
2015-08-15 13:34:12	Pidgeotto	: )
2015-08-15 13:41:26	@Espyo	heh
2015-08-15 13:42:28	Pidgeotto	mhm
2015-08-15 13:43:11	Pidgeotto	it was mostly due to the director being a complete ass about things, like never listening to the results of a vote, even if it was 12-4 against his own proposal
2015-08-15 13:43:44	Pidgeotto	fortunately, that's no longer a thing
2015-08-15 13:53:36	@Espyo	damn
2015-08-15 13:57:21	Pidgeotto	so nowadays doing that is called "doing a ralph"
2015-08-15 13:57:28	Pidgeotto	:yoshi:
2015-08-15 14:00:30	@J	that's the director's name?

2015-08-15 14:19:44	Pidgeotto	everyone called him ralph
2015-08-15 14:20:03	Pidgeotto	and yes, it is supposed to have a lowercase letter there; he's not "Ralph", he's "ralph"
2015-08-15 14:20:59	Pidgeotto	by the way, the ralph we're referring to is the one in The Simpsons
2015-08-15 14:31:33	@J	wait, he's named after the Simpsons Ralph?
2015-08-15 14:35:58	Pidgeotto	yes
2015-08-15 14:36:05	Pidgeotto	because he's a fan of the character
2015-08-15 14:36:06	Pidgeotto	hence,

2015-08-15 23:24:58	Waterpikmin	so i love the music in pikmin 3 and the ending theme is really cool
2015-08-15 23:25:04	Waterpikmin	except for one thing
2015-08-15 23:25:09	Waterpikmin	sound effects
2015-08-15 23:25:37	Waterpikmin	is there any way to get rid of the sound effects in the enidng cutscene?
2015-08-15 23:27:48	@Espyo	hmm
2015-08-15 23:27:52	@Espyo	there might
2015-08-15 23:27:55	@Espyo	I'll check the music folder in the game
2015-08-15 23:28:15	Waterpikmin	thank you! i remember seeing one video
2015-08-15 23:28:18	Waterpikmin	one sec
2015-08-15 23:29:33	Waterpikmin	for dazz reviews i think someone showed him an intro 
2015-08-15 23:29:45	Waterpikmin	and i think it had the ending
2015-08-15 23:31:11	Waterpikmin	without sfx, and since the music and voicing are most likely recorded separately, i think its availible
2015-08-15 23:31:41	Waterpikmin	even if not, there must be some way to remove it through sound techniques lol
2015-08-15 23:31:57	Waterpikmin	but that without sound effects would sound really cool and stuff

2015-08-16 12:38:23	Testyo	because in Portugal, it's a comma, but in programming it's a dot, so I'm accustomed to "mini-game"
2015-08-16 12:42:06	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-16 12:45:34	Yoshi2	Testyo: lm
2015-08-16 12:45:35	Testyo	I said because in Portugal, it's a comma, but in programming it's a dot, so I'm accustomed to "mini-game" because Yoshi2 mentioned my name. This random message came from the messages yeah, "minigame" sounds better, opposed to "mini-game" and because in Portugal, it's a comma, but in programming it's a dot, so I'm accustomed to both. They were joined by the common word to.

2015-08-16 13:56:50	@Espyo	woop
2015-08-16 13:57:50	Yoshi2	can't wait to do some programming again
2015-08-16 14:04:48	Yoshi2	I do want to do more work on the BMS thing, but people have also been screaming for me to do progress on the irc bot rewrite
2015-08-16 14:14:10	@Espyo	right
2015-08-16 14:14:28	@Espyo	well, BMS seems to get crazier the more you understand it
2015-08-16 14:14:31	@Espyo	and there's not much demand
2015-08-16 14:14:33	@Espyo	so I'd say go for the bot
2015-08-16 14:17:02	Yoshi2	the main thing that pushes me to do BMS stuff is the couple of files that I haven't been able to play yet
2015-08-16 14:18:44	Yoshi2	plus the fact that I really want to have correctly synchronized playback of the music files
2015-08-16 14:25:17	Yoshi2	so this will likely be my plan for the next couple of weeks
2015-08-16 14:25:54	Yoshi2	1) play games
2015-08-16 14:26:00	Yoshi2	2) work on BMS until I hit a wall

2015-08-16 23:35:50	@PikFan	maybe the last few types could be initially discovered by Candypop, and then have an Onion later on
2015-08-16 23:36:14	@PikFan	oh yeah, and I'm also thinking that Candypops should be able to convert 10, instead of 5
2015-08-16 23:37:14	@PikFan	in other news, I still haven't come up with a name for my flooded grassland area
2015-08-16 23:37:23	@PikFan	as well as the beach area and jungle area
2015-08-16 23:37:57	En_Passant	Tidal Plain?
2015-08-16 23:38:06	@PikFan	hm, maybe
2015-08-16 23:38:20	@PikFan	I was thinking something that started with Sinking
2015-08-16 23:38:46	@PikFan	Sinking Plains, Sinking Savanna, Sinking Grassland, ...
2015-08-16 23:39:09	@PikFan	but "grassland" and "savanna" are too plain
2015-08-16 23:39:21	@PikFan	...oh, I just made a pun
2015-08-16 23:39:22	@PikFan	heh
2015-08-16 23:41:44	En_Passant	kek
2015-08-16 23:42:01	En_Passant	I've been thinking that about some of my names, too
2015-08-16 23:43:15	En_Passant	Canon areas seem to have their adjectives be non-specific to the style of the area
2015-08-16 23:45:09	En_Passant	But there are exceptions to that, and some areas (namely in Pikmin 1) don't follow that style
2015-08-16 23:45:27	En_Passant	So... I don't know
2015-08-16 23:48:41	@PikFan	hmm...
2015-08-16 23:49:02	@PikFan	well, I like the forest names I made
2015-08-16 23:49:40	@PikFan	I'm just not sure how to make the Bitterfrost Woods different from the Whispering Grove
2015-08-16 23:49:57	@PikFan	maybe the Bitterfrost Woods could have more hills?
2015-08-16 23:50:19	@PikFan	oh right
2015-08-16 23:50:24	@PikFan	the plants would be different
2015-08-16 23:50:25	@PikFan	duh
2015-08-16 23:50:28	@PikFan	also snow
2015-08-16 23:50:31	@PikFan	duh, again
2015-08-16 23:50:35	@PikFan	but still...
2015-08-16 23:52:49	En_Passant	I don't get what you mean
2015-08-16 23:55:36	@PikFan	like, I'm not sure how to make it stand out enough so that it's not "just another forest area"
2015-08-16 23:56:27	Testyo	[Fanon RC] User account Kaplop created http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=User:Kaplop
2015-08-16 23:59:41	En_Passant	I'm not sure how it would be "just another forest area"
2015-08-17 00:00:26	En_Passant	The forest areas in the series are usually temperate and lush
2015-08-17 00:00:28	@PikFan	okay, what do you have in mind?
2015-08-17 00:00:41	En_Passant	Being cold alone makes the wildlife much different
2015-08-17 00:00:59	En_Passant	And yeah, definitely make it rougher terrain
2015-08-17 00:01:26	@PikFan	oh
2015-08-17 00:01:35	@PikFan	I failed to realize that
2015-08-17 00:01:37	@PikFan	derp
2015-08-17 00:01:51	@PikFan	well, it will be one of the last areas, so it will definitely be harder

2015-08-17 00:04:14	@PikFan	obstacle locations
2015-08-17 00:04:18	@Espyo	okay, but make it snappy
2015-08-17 00:04:26	@Espyo	what about?
2015-08-17 00:04:30	@PikFan	...you came back just for that?
2015-08-17 00:04:34	@Espyo	yeah
2015-08-17 00:04:34	@PikFan	okay
2015-08-17 00:04:39	@Espyo	not too terribly in a hurry
2015-08-17 00:04:44	@PikFan	so like, I wanted to add locations for the dirt mound
2015-08-17 00:04:49	@Espyo	mhm
2015-08-17 00:05:00	@PikFan	but I wasn't sure if I should put JUST the location, or add their contents
2015-08-17 00:05:08	@Espyo	oh, the contents too
2015-08-17 00:05:12	@PikFan	oh, okay
2015-08-17 00:05:23	@Espyo	in that case, a section called "List" instead of "Locations" should be better
2015-08-17 00:05:32	@Espyo	watch out, I think some dirt mounds change content between days
2015-08-17 00:05:46	@PikFan	really? where'd you hear that?
2015-08-17 00:05:52	@Espyo	pretty sure
2015-08-17 00:05:53	@Espyo	like
2015-08-17 00:05:57	@Espyo	first time I checked some dirt mounds
2015-08-17 00:06:01	@Espyo	got a million of bomb rocks
2015-08-17 00:06:04	@Espyo	next day, got one
2015-08-17 00:06:14	@Espyo	memory is vague, but I think that happens on the Tropical Wilds
2015-08-17 00:06:14	@PikFan	which one, specifically?
2015-08-17 00:06:22	@PikFan	that's what I was thinking
2015-08-17 00:06:26	@Espyo	maybe the one near the Whiptongue
2015-08-17 00:06:36	@PikFan	iirc that one always gives 2
2015-08-17 00:06:46	@Espyo	yeah, I think I got two the first time to help clear the reinforced wall
2015-08-17 00:06:58	@Espyo	but then the next day, I only got one, and I remember getting two the previous day
2015-08-17 00:07:05	@Espyo	but hey, that was on my first time playing, which was months ago
2015-08-17 00:07:14	@PikFan	you might be thinking about the one near the waterfall, which always has 2 bomb rocks inside of it, but the first time you see it, there's a 3rd bomb rock outside of it, nearby
2015-08-17 00:07:15	@Espyo	still, it should be easy to check
2015-08-17 00:07:21	@Espyo	go back in time in your save file to your first TW day
2015-08-17 00:07:23	@Espyo	check the contents
2015-08-17 00:07:28	@Espyo	then back again on your second TW day
2015-08-17 00:07:34	@Espyo	...if you know you used the dirt mound on the first day
2015-08-17 00:07:43	@Espyo	yeah, I might be thinking of that
2015-08-17 00:07:59	@PikFan	for whatever reason that 3rd bomb rock never appears again
2015-08-17 00:08:11	@Espyo	it's just there to tell you that this is a good place for bomb rocks
2015-08-17 00:08:15	@Espyo	just a warning, not really ammo
2015-08-17 00:08:16	@Espyo	*shrug*
2015-08-17 00:08:18	@Espyo	anyway, night
2015-08-17 00:08:23	@PikFan	one more question
2015-08-17 00:08:27	@Espyo	hmm?
2015-08-17 00:08:40	@PikFan	for fragments, I should list how many are in each pile, and what color they are, right?
2015-08-17 00:08:45	@PikFan	as well as their location
2015-08-17 00:08:51	@Espyo	mhm
2015-08-17 00:08:55	@PikFan	okay
2015-08-17 00:09:04	@Espyo	yeah, a list of piles
2015-08-17 00:09:13	@Espyo	and then something like "(10 red fragments)"
2015-08-17 00:09:14	@PikFan	all the other obstacles are "regular" obstacles, so to speak
2015-08-17 00:09:18	@Espyo	however you find best
2015-08-17 00:09:21	@PikFan	okay
2015-08-17 00:09:23	@Espyo	pretty much, yeah
2015-08-17 00:09:26	@PikFan	thanks
2015-08-17 00:09:27	@Espyo	oh
2015-08-17 00:09:30	@PikFan	?
2015-08-17 00:09:32	@Espyo	electrodes should say how many Yellows are needed
2015-08-17 00:09:39	@PikFan	oh, yeah
2015-08-17 00:09:40	En_Passant	Maybe make it mouseover text?
2015-08-17 00:09:46	@PikFan	oh, and I also remember flukeweeds
2015-08-17 00:09:48	@Espyo	and basically, if there are varying "properties" to each, add it too
2015-08-17 00:09:50	@Espyo	yeah, those too
2015-08-17 00:10:01	@Espyo	En_Passant: mouseover would help, but it could make it a bit overconfusing
2015-08-17 00:10:08	@PikFan	I may as well check all P3 obstacles so I'm not forgetting anything
2015-08-17 00:10:14	@Espyo	if the list is in a bullet point format, the info on the numbers and such might not be too crowded
2015-08-17 00:10:23	@Espyo	whereas having it somewhere on a mouseover could add unecessary effort for the reader
2015-08-17 00:10:29	@Espyo	plus, mobile users can't mouseover
2015-08-17 00:10:39	@Espyo	night
2015-08-17 00:10:40	@PikFan	special cases: dirt mounds, fragments, flukeweeds, electrodes
2015-08-17 00:10:46	@PikFan	all others regular
2015-08-17 00:10:49	@PikFan	thanks, and night

2015-08-17 00:15:05	@PikFan	and crystals
2015-08-17 00:15:19	@PikFan	okay, I think that's all of them
2015-08-17 00:15:29	En_Passant	Geysers?
2015-08-17 00:15:51	En_Passant	Some are covered
2015-08-17 00:15:56	@PikFan	oh, you mean like blocked — yeah
2015-08-17 00:16:39	En_Passant	I guess you could just make it its own image, like clogged holes in P2
2015-08-17 00:17:00	@PikFan	you mean, like an icon?
2015-08-17 00:17:13	En_Passant	Yeah
2015-08-17 00:17:37	En_Passant	That's what you're making, right? Area maps?
2015-08-17 00:17:49	@PikFan	yeah, I'm making area maps
2015-08-17 00:17:56	@PikFan	well, I will make area maps
2015-08-17 00:17:59	@PikFan	haven't started

2015-08-17 18:33:59	Klemen702	that probably counts as advertising tho :P
2015-08-17 18:34:29	Pidgeotto	why would it
2015-08-17 18:34:41	Klemen702	i am advertising a remix
2015-08-17 18:34:45	Klemen702	technicly
2015-08-17 18:34:47	Yoshi2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAQoMtKPRBI
2015-08-17 18:34:51	Klemen702	not that it's bad to do
2015-08-17 18:35:09	Klemen702	oh
2015-08-17 18:35:10	Pidgeotto	no, you're saying 'this free thing is good'
2015-08-17 18:35:17	Pidgeotto	advertising would be like
2015-08-17 18:35:21	Pidgeotto	'hey buy this and this'
2015-08-17 18:35:26	Klemen702	ooh
2015-08-17 18:35:30	Klemen702	you have a point there
2015-08-17 18:35:42	Pidgeotto	in fact, what you're doing now is recommending us to listen to it
2015-08-17 18:35:49	Yoshi2	it would also be advertising if it was something you were involved in
2015-08-17 18:35:55	Pidgeotto	this should not count as advertising at all
2015-08-17 18:35:59	Yoshi2	e.g. "Check out this forum I created"
2015-08-17 18:36:01	Pidgeotto	yes
2015-08-17 18:36:03	Klemen702	thanks i guess lol
2015-08-17 18:36:19	Yoshi2	otherwise, sharing links at all would be illegal in this channel

2015-08-17 21:14:32	UltraMario	some levels are made by different deveopers too
2015-08-17 21:14:35	UltraMario	like
2015-08-17 21:14:49	UltraMario	one of the levels is designed by rayman's creator

2015-08-17 21:16:08	UltraMario	eh idk
2015-08-17 21:16:28	UltraMario	it'd be cool if they got indie devs to make levels tho

2015-08-17 21:16:41	UltraMario	have them have downloadable levels online

2015-08-19 18:48:59	Pikpainter777	Like what?
2015-08-19 18:49:55	Kaplop	You should at least make the plot be as detailed as the Pikmin ideas.
2015-08-19 18:50:15	Kaplop	Like, why you need to do that.
2015-08-19 18:50:27	Pikpainter777	Ok. Im on wikia, too!

2015-08-19 19:07:51	Kaplop	It was last updated in December
2015-08-19 19:07:55	Kaplop	Last year
2015-08-19 19:09:11	Pikpainter777	can you help out on my weird-glitches-in-whatever.wikia.com/wiki?
2015-08-19 19:09:49	Kaplop	Did you create it?

2015-08-19 19:10:09	Pikpainter777	yup that's the link.
2015-08-19 19:11:08	Kaplop	Hey, Yoshi
2015-08-19 19:11:27	Yoshi2	creating a completely new wiki is a lot of work, maybe it is better if you contributed to an existing wiki about glitches in games
2015-08-19 19:11:34	Kaplop	Did you look at the game?
2015-08-19 19:11:47	--	Pikpainter777 is now known as Pikmin
2015-08-19 19:11:56	Yoshi2	Kaplop: the pikmin rpg game?
2015-08-19 19:12:04	Kaplop	Yeah
2015-08-19 19:12:04	Pikmin	what the heck!?!?!?!?!?
2015-08-19 19:12:20	Pidgeotto	If you want spaces, you need to use the '_' character.
2015-08-19 19:12:24	Kaplop	The community game
2015-08-19 19:12:51	Yoshi2	yup, looks like it is planned to use the ATB battle system, which is/was used by a number of final fantasy games
2015-08-19 19:13:42	Yoshi2	a lot of effort was put into the stats and spells, but I'm a bit disappointed that nobody did any work on the locations of the game
2015-08-19 19:13:59	--	Pikmin is now known as Pikpainter777
2015-08-19 19:14:29	Kaplop	Maybe we should revive it or make a new page?
2015-08-19 19:15:30	Kaplop	Also, I think the characters and spells should be in a subpage

2015-08-19 19:15:58	Yoshi2	agreed, they take up a lot of room
2015-08-19 19:17:19	Kaplop	Also, since RPG's have a lot of story, they should make a whole page for the storyline
2015-08-19 19:18:57	Kaplop	Also, shouldn't Pik-Pik have a description if he's the 2nd main character?

2015-08-19 19:30:08	Kaplop	Oh
2015-08-19 19:30:35	Kaplop	Also, just a question
2015-08-19 19:30:52	Kaplop	To become a leaf-ranked, do you need 3 talk sections or 4?
2015-08-19 19:31:29	@Espyo	there should be a page somewhere that explains it
2015-08-19 19:31:34	Kaplop	Ik
2015-08-19 19:31:38	Kaplop	The ranks page
2015-08-19 19:31:44	@Espyo	what does it say?
2015-08-19 19:32:00	Kaplop	It says you need more than 3 to become a leaf, but to become a bud you need 4
2015-08-19 19:32:22	Kaplop	So that means they have the same talk section requirement
2015-08-19 19:33:12	Pidgeotto	Kaplop: pls have patience, you can't expect everyone to always be chatting.
2015-08-19 19:33:50	Yoshi2	"The Leaf is the second rank. It is for users that have at least 100 edits and more than 3 sections on their talk page. "

2015-08-19 19:34:43	Yoshi2	you're right

2015-08-19 21:42:45	Yoshi2	a channel created specifically for playing around with testyo so this channel is spammed less
2015-08-19 21:42:53	Testyo	but after asking somebody if I could do bah
2015-08-19 21:43:03	UltraMario	oh
2015-08-19 21:43:07	Kaplop	I'll be on the Testyo chat

2015-08-19 21:45:50	UltraMario	Yoshi2: not in a Mario level ;(
2015-08-19 21:45:53	UltraMario	*;
2015-08-19 21:45:55	UltraMario	;)
2015-08-19 21:46:32	UltraMario	also btw i thought of another idea to addon to my obscure levels list: the level from the weird fan-game Normal Super Marip Bros.
2015-08-19 21:46:49	Yoshi2	UltraMario: Oh You
2015-08-19 21:46:53	Yoshi2	I liked that game
2015-08-19 21:46:58	UltraMario	of course, it wouldn't be 100% accurate, cuz it wouldn't have everything. :p
2015-08-19 21:47:02	UltraMario	i did too :>
2015-08-19 21:47:13	UltraMario	im just saying it was kinda weird ;p
2015-08-19 21:47:35	Pikpainter777	[?]
2015-08-19 21:47:48	UltraMario	cant do NSMB2 (not THAT NSMB2. :p) for obvious reasons tho
2015-08-19 21:47:56	UltraMario	rip smb2
2015-08-19 21:48:12	UltraMario	well
2015-08-19 21:48:33	UltraMario	i mean i could but id have to make a lot of liberties
2015-08-19 21:49:24	Yoshi2	yup
2015-08-19 21:49:38	UltraMario	i mean thats why im considering doing non-mario levels AFTER i do my obscure level conquest because they might have to have a lot of tweaks depending on the level
2015-08-19 21:49:43	Yoshi2	can't really recreate a level whose main feature is you being on drugs
2015-08-19 21:50:09	UltraMario	well i meant cuz it had smb2 mechanics, not the drug part xP
2015-08-19 21:50:16	Yoshi2	ah
2015-08-19 21:50:33	Pikpainter777	ESEDROPPING AND NOT INTERESTED! go on!
2015-08-19 21:50:35	UltraMario	there's actually a special effect like that in game, it's like touch fuzzy get dizzy
2015-08-19 21:50:42	UltraMario	wow rude
2015-08-19 21:50:55	UltraMario	if youre not interested dont say anything at all then :S
2015-08-19 21:51:01	UltraMario	;_;

2015-08-19 21:51:30	UltraMario	it's okay i guess :s
2015-08-19 21:51:43	Yoshi2	it's not okay :V
2015-08-19 21:51:48	Kaplop	Normal super mario Bros? That game is hilarious. 
2015-08-19 21:51:56	UltraMario	yea it is

2015-08-19 21:52:20	Kaplop	Although they should have saved the Fuzzy for yoshi

2015-08-19 21:52:50	UltraMario	some of SMM's special effects could be worked with maybe though

2015-08-19 22:11:46	@J	had to learn how to call internationally
2015-08-19 22:12:17	@Espyo	I'm guessing it worked
2015-08-19 22:12:23	@J	yes
2015-08-19 22:12:30	@Espyo	you had to do the +123 45678901234, right?

2015-08-19 22:14:22	@Espyo	anyway yeah J, I tried that before leaving to the UK too, but... it didn't work
2015-08-19 22:14:28	Kaplop	Back
2015-08-19 22:14:28	@J	hmm
2015-08-19 22:14:31	Pikpainter777	I understand
2015-08-19 22:14:32	@Espyo	it started working once I WAS in the UK, though, to phone back home
2015-08-19 22:14:44	Kaplop	What are you talking about?
2015-08-19 22:14:50	@Espyo	international phone calls
2015-08-19 22:14:51	@J	making international phone calls
2015-08-19 22:14:57	Kaplop	Oh.
2015-08-19 22:15:11	@Espyo	a friend that comes to Portugal on holiday did say that before phoning Portugal, he had to have been there once
2015-08-19 22:15:13	@J	wait, you went to the UK?
2015-08-19 22:15:18	@Espyo	I thought I said this
2015-08-19 22:15:22	@Espyo	yeah, met up with friends I met on IRC
2015-08-19 22:15:25	@Espyo	for a week
2015-08-19 22:15:25	Pikpainter777	What were you doing,Kaplop?
2015-08-19 22:15:28	@Espyo	was pretty fun
2015-08-19 22:15:33	@Espyo	your bus drivers are weird
2015-08-19 22:15:34	@J	hmm
2015-08-19 22:15:39	Testyo	[Fanon RC] Buds by Pikpainter777 (+261 N Created page with "Buds are the little rooms in an Onion, one per Pikmin.  Their...) http://www.pikminfanon.com/index.php?title=Buds&curid=9844&diff=49206&oldid=0
2015-08-19 22:15:43	@J	yes
2015-08-19 22:15:54	@Espyo	first bus driver, we told him to wait one second before riding off, I just needed to take money off my pouch for a Megarider
2015-08-19 22:15:58	@J	probably because they drive buses all day
2015-08-19 22:16:01	@Espyo	this was after he asked if we were boarding
2015-08-19 22:16:10	@Espyo	and then he just gunned off, ignoring what we said
2015-08-19 22:16:21	@Espyo	the second bus driver I met let me get in for free, even though I asked him for a Megarider
2015-08-19 22:16:33	@Espyo	we later assumed he didn't have change, so he just let me in anyway
2015-08-19 22:16:36	@Espyo	but he could as well be nuts
2015-08-19 22:16:41	@Espyo	third guy was crazy with banter
2015-08-19 22:16:49	Kaplop	Pikpainter777, what's with the "Buds" page?
2015-08-19 22:16:55	@Espyo	luckily we're used to it after being friends for like 4 years, but still
2015-08-19 22:17:07	@Espyo	Portugal has bus drivers too, of course, but they act pretty non-crazy
2015-08-19 22:17:23	Pikpainter777	It's my idea of an onion's Inside
2015-08-19 22:17:23	@J	where was it?
2015-08-19 22:17:33	Pikpainter777	Me?
2015-08-19 22:17:37	@J	no, Espyo
2015-08-19 22:17:42	Pikpainter777	o
2015-08-19 22:18:02	@Espyo	where was what? where I went? Manchester
2015-08-19 22:18:17	@J	hmm, okay, my cousin goes to university there
2015-08-19 22:18:36	@Espyo	the others had to take long train rides to get there
2015-08-19 22:18:40	@Espyo	so... pretty big place
2015-08-19 22:18:56	Kaplop	Btw, Pikpainter777, I was doing Top-Secret stuff
2015-08-19 22:18:59	@Espyo	oh, what probably surprised me the most about the UK
2015-08-19 22:19:03	@J	wait, you didn't meet where any of them lived?
2015-08-19 22:19:15	@Espyo	was how it actually LOOKED LIKE a Harry Potter setting
2015-08-19 22:19:19	@Espyo	the houses are all red bricks
2015-08-19 22:19:28	@Espyo	I thought that that was just Hollywood stuff, but nope
2015-08-19 22:19:35	@Espyo	yeah, we stayed where one lived
2015-08-19 22:19:46	@Espyo	"the others", the ones that didn't live in Manchester, I meant

2015-08-19 22:20:08	@J	well, train rides being long wouldn't be so much because it's big as because the trains are slow
2015-08-19 22:20:43	Pikpainter777	Testyo, can you shut up?
2015-08-19 22:20:44	Testyo	to shut down, you need to go to this really awkward bar on the right side of the computer running, though
2015-08-19 22:20:46	@J	also my parents' house has red bricks
2015-08-19 22:21:07	@Espyo	I bet it does, a lot of them did
2015-08-19 22:21:11	@Espyo	it was magical, I'm telling you
2015-08-19 22:21:20	@Espyo	yeah, that too, about the trains

2015-08-19 22:49:34	UltraMario	i voted smash since i thought since i already did one series based tourney, i would mix it up for the next tourney. but i made the poll to see what everyone else thought just in case they thought i should do something else :p

2015-08-19 23:12:19	@Espyo	that means that the size of the page is now 17 letters smaller than it was before
2015-08-19 23:12:27	@Espyo	the m means that whoever made that change marked it as minor

2015-08-21 20:07:13	@Espyo	it's not shooting a list of the lines it found it on, like on windows
2015-08-21 20:07:46	@Espyo	found why
2015-08-21 20:08:07	@Espyo	I was grepping the Pikmin 3 string files, and they don't really have line breaks
2015-08-21 20:08:18	@Espyo	so I guess that it chose to just say "found it" instead of spamming the output

2015-08-27 18:52:32	@J	how is everyone?  Played any new games recently?
2015-08-27 18:57:57	Yoshi3	it's boring without testyo
2015-08-27 18:58:20	Yoshi3	J: I've started playing FF7 for the first time
2015-08-27 18:58:32	Yoshi3	not exactly a new game, but I've never played it before :>
2015-08-27 19:03:29	@J	oh, I heard there was a re-release - that one, or the original?
2015-08-27 19:03:35	@J	(emulated?)
2015-08-27 19:05:20	Yoshi3	original
2015-08-27 19:05:25	Yoshi3	emulated
2015-08-27 19:06:51	@J	RPGs never really appealed to me that much - I think I've only played some Mario and Pokémon ones
2015-08-27 19:06:55	@J	and maybe some free ones
2015-08-27 19:07:21	@J	probably because of the grind
2015-08-27 19:07:33	@J	and to make combat grind fun it has to be quite complex
2015-08-27 19:11:31	Pidgey	and also because picking the right combination of equipment and stuff
2015-08-27 19:11:35	Pidgey	you've said this before
2015-08-27 19:11:40	Pidgey	I remember this
2015-08-27 19:12:04	@J	did I?
2015-08-27 19:12:05	@J	maybe
2015-08-27 19:13:21	Yoshi3	Pidgey: the equipment stuff is usually straightforward in final fantasy, with the exception of spells 
2015-08-27 19:13:38	Pidgey	min-maxing though
2015-08-27 19:14:29	Yoshi3	that's kinda part of the grind
2015-08-27 19:14:35	Yoshi3	well
2015-08-27 19:15:06	Yoshi3	I don't remember much min-maxing in terms of equipment in final fantasy games
2015-08-27 19:15:14	Yoshi3	spells are a different story though
2015-08-27 19:15:38	Yoshi3	and in those games I played, that was part of the grind
2015-08-27 19:16:37	Yoshi3	and the grind is not a whole lot of fun
2015-08-27 19:18:18	Yoshi3	I'm mostly playing the game because a lot of people seem to like it, but one of my friends hates the game

2015-08-28 20:21:30	@J	it's just called a bank holiday

2015-08-29 20:27:33	@J	https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/play-for-free-today/
2015-08-29 20:27:36	@J	so this just happened
2015-08-29 20:27:41	@J	this is the MMO I've been playing
2015-08-29 20:29:29	@J	okay, looks like they restricted free accounts somewhat, but not in any way that sounds detrimental to playing, only to avoid bots
2015-08-29 20:29:56	Yoshi2	interesting
2015-08-29 20:31:07	@J	I don't know if you were around when I mentioned I'd been playing an MMO before
2015-08-29 20:31:23	Yoshi2	probably not
2015-08-29 20:31:32	@J	basically I've played free ones and trials of others before, but this is the first I've actually enjoyed beyond the first few hours
2015-08-29 20:31:43	@J	everything else goes straight into grind
2015-08-29 20:31:55	Yoshi2	heh
2015-08-29 20:32:50	Yoshi2	yeah, a lot of MMOs seem to have a lot of grind
2015-08-29 20:33:10	@J	at least in part because they have subscriptions, I guess
2015-08-29 20:33:33	@J	it's in their interest to make you take as long as possible to reach and get through the fun parts
2015-08-29 20:35:49	@J	anyway, I encourage anyone to give it a go if your computer isn't terrible and you have at least some free time
2015-08-29 20:36:14	Yoshi2	I doubt any subscription mmo would survive using that method
2015-08-29 20:36:33	@J	what do you mean?
2015-08-29 20:36:45	@J	[20:33:33] @J it's in their interest to make you take as long as possible to reach and get through the fun parts
2015-08-29 20:36:46	@J	this?
2015-08-29 20:36:52	Yoshi2	because free mmos also want you to take as long as possible to reach a high level so they can sell more exp scrolls and stuff like that
2015-08-29 20:36:54	Yoshi2	yes
2015-08-29 20:37:10	@J	they already do that and survive fine
2015-08-29 20:37:20	@J	because so many people tolerate it
2015-08-29 20:38:09	Yoshi2	well, I meant if that was the only thing they did
2015-08-29 20:38:27	Yoshi2	you can "enjoy" an endless grind for free with free mmos
2015-08-29 20:38:58	Yoshi2	I think WoW actually lets you pay to get a character directly to max level
2015-08-29 20:39:18	@J	nice
2015-08-29 20:39:44	@J	yeah, there has to be something to hook players
2015-08-29 20:39:51	@J	at least a promise of something fun later on
2015-08-29 20:40:13	Yoshi2	a good endgame
2015-08-29 20:41:07	Yoshi2	hm, did Espyo say something about going on vacation or something like that?
2015-08-29 20:43:34	@J	yeah, for 7 days
2015-08-29 20:43:39	@J	coming back soon then, I guess
2015-08-29 20:44:43	Yoshi2	ah
2015-08-29 20:45:12	Yoshi2	my life feels a bit more empty when testyo isn't around
2015-08-29 20:45:30	Yoshi2	I have a few other bots to play with, but those aren't testyo

2015-08-30 22:55:25	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-30 22:55:30	@Espyo	went okay for the most part
2015-08-30 22:55:33	@Espyo	some bumps here and there, nothing big
2015-08-30 22:55:40	@Espyo	still miffed that HexChat forgot some settings
2015-08-30 22:56:04	@J	where did you go?
2015-08-30 22:56:15	@J	hey, it just missed you
2015-08-30 22:59:45	@Espyo	to the south of Portugal
2015-08-30 22:59:57	@Espyo	but every time I turned on the laptop, it starts too
2015-08-30 23:00:00	@Espyo	so it can't have missed me

2015-08-30 23:06:14	@PikFan	hi
2015-08-30 23:06:44	@PikFan	ok, so yesterday I brought up something
2015-08-30 23:07:02	@PikFan	see [[Talk:Music in Pikmin 2#Secret Testing Range]]
2015-08-30 23:07:02	Testyo	"Talk:Music_in_Pikmin_2#Secret_Testing_Range" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Talk:Music_in_Pikmin_2#Secret_Testing_Range
2015-08-30 23:08:00	@PikFan	it's that the music that plays on sublevel 5 of the Snagret Hole, is in fact, different from sublevel 1 of the Cavern of Chaos and sublevel 6 of the Subterranean Complex
2015-08-30 23:08:23	@PikFan	the article says that Metal 3 plays on those three sublevels
2015-08-30 23:08:36	@Espyo	hi
2015-08-30 23:08:47	@PikFan	but a unique variation of Metal 3 is exclusive to SH level 5
2015-08-30 23:09:13	@J	it missed being able to connect to the internet, then

2015-08-30 23:09:24	@J	ie. it missed me
2015-08-30 23:09:32	@Espyo	hmmmmm
2015-08-30 23:09:41	@PikFan	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6qz5nw0KG4&feature=youtu.be
2015-08-30 23:09:50	@PikFan	that's the one for SH 5
2015-08-30 23:10:12	@PikFan	problem is, I can't find a video that has JUST the music for CoC 1 or SC 6
2015-08-30 23:10:16	@Espyo	hmm, I'd call Scruffy
2015-08-30 23:10:26	@Espyo	I just got home, still packing stuff up
2015-08-30 23:10:34	@PikFan	oh, right
2015-08-30 23:10:38	@PikFan	how was your vacation?
2015-08-30 23:10:41	@J	not unpacking?
2015-08-30 23:10:48	@Espyo	and I've left my 3DS hanging on Fire Emblem: Awakening, with a very important question on it
2015-08-30 23:10:51	@Espyo	and I'm itching to answer it
2015-08-30 23:10:58	@Espyo	packing... stuff inside the closets and all
2015-08-30 23:11:01	@Espyo	ssh, it makes sense
2015-08-30 23:11:06	@PikFan	I think he meant packing — yeah, that
2015-08-30 23:11:07	@Espyo	it was fine for the most part, PikFan
2015-08-30 23:11:16	@Espyo	just tiny problems here and there, nothing unusual
2015-08-30 23:12:22	@PikFan	Espyo: Scruffy has yet to answer
2015-08-30 23:16:41	@Espyo	we should send something on his page
2015-08-30 23:16:43	@Espyo	so he gets notified
2015-08-30 23:17:26	@PikFan	I don't want to hassle him
2015-08-30 23:17:41	@PikFan	but if he doesn't respond in a few days then I'll tell him
2015-08-30 23:17:45	@Espyo	right
2015-08-30 23:17:53	@Espyo	ugh, as if Pikmin 2 could ever stop being Pikmin 2
2015-08-30 23:18:06	@PikFan	Neini did pull up the game files
2015-08-30 23:18:41	Pi	oh hey it's a PikFan

2015-08-30 23:21:38	Pi	ah
2015-08-30 23:22:12	@PikFan	not looking forward to that
2015-08-30 23:22:36	@PikFan	how about you?
2015-08-30 23:25:11	@Espyo	so did I @game files
2015-08-30 23:25:16	@Espyo	my conclusion: they don't make sense, don't read them
2015-08-30 23:25:38	@PikFan	heh
2015-08-30 23:25:53	@PikFan	what En Passant said though made me irritated
2015-08-30 23:26:09	@PikFan	sure, I can understand his disbelief from my not providing evidence
2015-08-30 23:26:32	@PikFan	but it felt like he was deliberately attacking my statement
2015-08-30 23:26:40	@Espyo	that's how he is
2015-08-30 23:27:11	@PikFan	heh, why do you say that?
2015-08-30 23:28:41	@Espyo	on skype he's pretty aggressive too
2015-08-30 23:29:52	@PikFan	oh?
2015-08-30 23:30:05	@PikFan	does he go after the PW folk?
2015-08-30 23:31:07	@Espyo	sometimes
2015-08-30 23:31:10	@Espyo	I don't follow the chat much
2015-08-30 23:31:20	@Espyo	...because every day, when I login, there's like 600+ unread messages
2015-08-30 23:32:26	@PikFan	I see
2015-08-30 23:33:16	@PikFan	I would complain about them using skype, but I don't feel like it today
2015-08-30 23:33:30	@PikFan	I'll complain some other time
2015-08-30 23:35:19	@Espyo	heh
2015-08-30 23:48:14	@PikFan	oh, Pi

2015-08-30 23:50:40	@PikFan	and it was stuck in my head
2015-08-30 23:50:55	Pi	oh god that one is so awful to get in your head
2015-08-30 23:51:09	@PikFan	but it's so...

2015-08-30 23:52:07	Pi	the better one to get in your head is SadoMasoPedoRoboNecroBestiality
2015-08-30 23:52:12	Pi	it's the best
2015-08-30 23:52:24	@PikFan	that song title though
2015-08-30 23:52:28	Pi	yeah
2015-08-30 23:52:49	@PikFan	something tells me that the actual song contradicts its title
2015-08-30 23:53:36	@PikFan	anyway, yeah, my friends have been using the trolls' relationships
2015-08-30 23:53:52	@PikFan	and the thing is, they actually are very fitting for my friends and I
2015-08-30 23:54:40	@PikFan	at one point I was auspices between my friend, her sister, and I
2015-08-30 23:55:09	@PikFan	and now I'm her moirail

2015-08-31 00:01:57	Pi	sorry, Espyo
2015-08-31 00:02:36	@PikFan	anyway, I brought this up because I remember all those years ago when you tried to explain shipping to me
2015-08-31 00:03:11	@PikFan	also, because I needed advice
2015-08-31 00:03:35	Pi	oh
2015-08-31 00:03:36	Pi	right
2015-08-31 00:03:47	Pi	yeah, my advice is: don't get into it
2015-08-31 00:04:01	@Espyo	nah, I know Homestuck is the world's most complex thing
2015-08-31 00:04:03	@PikFan	yeah, I know
2015-08-31 00:04:17	Pi	okay so there are six acts right now
2015-08-31 00:04:30	Pi	I think I understand everything that happens in the first three acts
2015-08-31 00:04:46	Pi	and I've read them like
2015-08-31 00:04:47	Pi	five times
2015-08-31 00:05:10	Pi	then there's act 4 which I'm like "what is this" about still
2015-08-31 00:05:20	Pi	then act 5 is "no don't even try"
2015-08-31 00:05:31	Pi	then act 6 is "OH GOD MY BRAIN IS FRYING PLEASE HELP"
2015-08-31 00:05:46	@PikFan	welp
2015-08-31 00:05:53	@PikFan	I'm not reading it
2015-08-31 00:06:52	@Espyo	I have to go now... too bad it's a work day tomorrow

2015-08-31 00:08:31	Pi	night
2015-08-31 00:08:50	Pi	and like, to give you a size comparison here
2015-08-31 00:09:08	Pi	you know how much of an undertaking it is to read through the entire Harry Potter series?

2015-08-31 00:09:24	@PikFan	and yeah?
2015-08-31 00:09:51	Pi	Homestuck isn't even finished yet, and its size is more than 110% that of the size of the entire Harry Potter series
2015-08-31 00:10:20	@PikFan	wait, it's double the size of Harry Potter?
2015-08-31 00:10:21	@PikFan	wow
2015-08-31 00:10:34	Pi	double would be 200%
2015-08-31 00:10:52	Pi	110% is the entire Harry Potter series plus one tenth of the Harry Potter series
2015-08-31 00:11:58	@PikFan	oh, okay, because you said 110%, which I rounded down to 100%, and I misinterpreted that, because when I hear "100% more", I think double
2015-08-31 00:17:30	Pi	I found the exact figure that's correct for now
2015-08-31 00:17:33	Pi	it's 122%
2015-08-31 00:18:06	Pi	at 13186888 words
2015-08-31 00:18:37	Pi	wait no
2015-08-31 00:18:42	Pi	*1318688
2015-08-31 00:18:50	Pi	so 1,318,688
2015-08-31 00:19:37	@PikFan	wow
2015-08-31 00:20:23	Pi	it's insane
2015-08-31 00:20:30	Pi	I'm insane for keeping track
2015-08-31 00:20:35	Pi	I'm insane for still liking it
2015-08-31 00:20:42	Pi	please, somebody save me
2015-08-31 00:20:50	Pi	(I can't be saved)
