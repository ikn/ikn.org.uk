2014-07-21 03:09:59	@PikFan	and our intent was to leave the old website behind

2014-07-21 19:49:35	Nvortex	when pikmin liquefy in the onion, the onion retrieves all the data from the pikmin and gets it into all pikmin so they know what is good and what is bad because pikmin dont see well they just perceive light but because they are really evolved, they can diferentiate certain shades and silouettes, the pikmin know what is everything because the memories areshare

2014-07-21 19:51:33	@PikFan	I think that the Onion has highly advanced technology
2014-07-21 19:51:40	Dave10772	Canon
2014-07-21 19:51:54	@PikFan	of course, that's just me
2014-07-21 19:52:05	Nvortex	thats why they attack flint beetles and nectar weeds without command, they know that itbgives pelllets and nectar
2014-07-21 19:52:19	@Espyo	actually
2014-07-21 19:52:26	@Espyo	they go after nectar weed because of a game design thing
2014-07-21 19:52:28	@PikFan	well in P1 they attacked Flint Beetles w/o command
2014-07-21 19:52:33	@Espyo	theories aside, it is because of that
2014-07-21 19:52:43	@Espyo	like, players normally wouldn't care about some boring grass
2014-07-21 19:52:45	Nvortex	ignoring game mechanics
2014-07-21 19:52:50	@Espyo	the chances of a pl-- all right
2014-07-21 19:52:57	@Espyo	just saying
2014-07-21 19:52:57	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-21 19:53:18	Dave10772	Pikmin 4, possible?
2014-07-21 19:53:20	@PikFan	in P2 they would ignore them unless you commanded them to
2014-07-21 19:53:34	@PikFan	ooh, me and Espyo had a discussion about P4 a long time ago
2014-07-21 19:53:40	Nvortex	and the onions from pikmin 3 are the technological ones
2014-07-21 19:53:55	ZoltCat	maybe, pikmin 4
2014-07-21 19:53:59	@PikFan	at first the P3 Onion seemed confusing
2014-07-21 19:54:02	Nvortex	they have engines, solar panels and metal
2014-07-21 19:54:09	@PikFan	but it's actually convenient
2014-07-21 19:54:12	Nvortex	and they fuse too
2014-07-21 19:54:19	Nvortex	i personally dont like them
2014-07-21 19:54:26	@PikFan	like, in my game, I have what... 14 species of Pikmin
2014-07-21 19:54:34	@PikFan	that all end up with onions late in the game
2014-07-21 19:55:16	Nvortex	i found interesting stuff in pikmin 2 (espyo ignore game mechanics...)
2014-07-21 19:55:32	@PikFan	er, 10
2014-07-21 19:55:36	@PikFan	I exaggerated
2014-07-21 19:55:43	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-21 19:56:04	ZoltCat	Well, mayby 2 onions that can hold 7 pikmin types each?
2014-07-21 19:56:25	@PikFan	no I said I don't have 14 Pikmin

2014-07-21 19:57:01	@PikFan	1 onion for canon colors, another for fanon
2014-07-21 19:57:30	@PikFan	also, you'll see that in my game, Rock and Winged Pikmin are absent
2014-07-21 19:57:36	Nvortex	when you first arrive in the planet, olimar finds 5 red pikmin and louie finds the onion or should i say AN onion because its not the same onion from the pikmin olimar finds, because when louie arrives, the onion drops a seed like of it was a pikmin extinction but there were already 5 in the field

2014-07-21 20:00:46	Nvortex	and maybe an expedition to PNF-404 was made before olimar
2014-07-21 20:00:46	Nvortex	the ship hinted it in pikmin 2

2014-07-21 20:14:01	@Espyo	stuff won't actually get moved until two things happen
2014-07-21 20:14:18	@Espyo	a) we create the namespace where the archives will be, so that we can have an edit history for Pikmin Wiki edits
2014-07-21 20:14:24	@Espyo	we don't want the users to lose their edit history
2014-07-21 20:14:33	@Espyo	and b), J changes his wiki bot to do what we need
2014-07-21 20:14:58	@PikFan	it's possible to make new namespaces?
2014-07-21 20:15:15	@PikFan	wait, I shouldn't be asking that, it IS possible
2014-07-21 20:15:20	@PikFan	but how?
2014-07-21 20:27:52	@J	you have to do it in the server configuration files

2014-07-21 22:08:54	@PikFan	I wanted to say counter-intuitive, but that wasn't fitting
2014-07-21 22:10:46	@PikFan	speaking of Louie never gets screen time
2014-07-21 22:11:18	@PikFan	what about images with the President in them? what if someone who's playing P2 but hasn't finished the debt comes along and sees the President?
2014-07-21 22:11:33	@Espyo	hmmmm

2014-07-21 22:13:18	@PikFan	I think that we need to make the spoiler warning on the main page more noticeable
2014-07-21 22:13:32	@PikFan	right now it's just a little piece of text

2014-07-22 12:19:15	@PikFan	why is it that the [[Piklopedia]] has two tables about enemies, yet [[Enemy]] has none

2014-07-22 12:20:05	@Espyo	hmm, good point
2014-07-22 12:20:17	@Espyo	still a remnant from when [[Enemy]] WAS [[Piklopedia]]
2014-07-22 12:20:18	Testyo	"Enemy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Enemy
2014-07-22 12:20:24	@Espyo	not quite sure how to solve it
2014-07-22 12:21:00	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-22 12:21:14	@PikFan	we could replace the tables with just a numbered list
2014-07-22 12:21:21	@PikFan	move the tables to Enemy
2014-07-22 12:21:34	@PikFan	and also make tables for P1 and P3
2014-07-22 12:21:36	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2014-07-22 12:21:41	@Espyo	maybe remove the locations table?
2014-07-22 12:21:43	@Espyo	it's not that useful
2014-07-22 12:22:04	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-22 12:22:47	@PikFan	one thing
2014-07-22 12:22:54	@PikFan	what about P3 enemy health?
2014-07-22 12:23:08	@PikFan	I wonder how someone would get that
2014-07-22 12:23:14	@PikFan	it would be very useful
2014-07-22 12:23:41	@PikFan	(by very I mean it'd be interesting at first then it'd just be another thing)

2014-07-22 12:25:43	@PikFan	I remember the spreadsheet with Pikmin attacks
2014-07-22 12:25:47	@PikFan	not this one though
2014-07-22 12:26:25	@Espyo	it's the first page of that file
2014-07-22 12:26:28	@Espyo	on the bottom corner
2014-07-22 12:26:32	@Espyo	you can switch pages
2014-07-22 12:26:33	@PikFan	...oh
2014-07-22 12:26:38	@Espyo	at first I thought it was that too
2014-07-22 12:26:41	@Espyo	but it also has the HP
2014-07-22 12:27:26	@PikFan	yeah, I see it now
2014-07-22 12:28:25	@PikFan	this reminds me
2014-07-22 12:28:40	@PikFan	we still have to make P3 parameters for enemy infoboxes
2014-07-22 12:29:20	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-22 12:29:49	@PikFan	especially now that Pikmin Wiki is moving here
2014-07-22 12:30:56	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure I've asked this before, but what about height?
2014-07-22 12:31:12	@PikFan	on {{infobox enemy}}
2014-07-22 12:31:13	Testyo	"infobox_enemy" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:infobox_enemy
2014-07-22 12:32:20	@Espyo	wasn't that e-reader only?
2014-07-22 12:32:40	@PikFan	yeah, it says on the page
2014-07-22 12:32:56	@PikFan	since P3 doesn't have height, it's inconsistent
2014-07-22 12:33:12	@Espyo	we'll remove it if we detect it's a P3-only enemy
2014-07-22 12:33:37	@PikFan	well, yeah
2014-07-22 12:33:52	@PikFan	but I meant enemies that appear in not just P3
2014-07-22 12:34:55	@Espyo	if they appear in not just P3, leave it
2014-07-22 12:34:59	@Espyo	it's the confirmed height
2014-07-22 12:36:05	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-22 12:36:19	@PikFan	there's three parameters for height though
2014-07-22 12:36:43	@Espyo	really?
2014-07-22 12:36:45	@PikFan	if an enemy appears in all games, and in P1 and P2, it has differing heights, what does that mean for P3?
2014-07-22 12:36:54	@Espyo	that shouldn't be the case
2014-07-22 12:36:58	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-22 12:36:59	@Espyo	height is e-reader only
2014-07-22 12:37:03	@Espyo	so it has to be the same in all games
2014-07-22 12:37:08	@Espyo	because it refers to no game in particular
2014-07-22 12:37:13	@PikFan	|height, |height_1, |height_2
2014-07-22 12:37:19	@Espyo	alternately...
2014-07-22 12:37:26	@Espyo	we get rid of the height on the infobox
2014-07-22 12:37:33	@Espyo	and for enemies with e-cards, we create an e-card section
2014-07-22 12:37:35	@PikFan	er no, ignore the underscores
2014-07-22 12:37:36	@Espyo	and dump that info there
2014-07-22 12:37:45	@PikFan	I like that
2014-07-22 12:38:18	@PikFan	I was also considering getting rid of it, but it's still info, so we can't exactly get rid of it
2014-07-22 12:38:27	@Espyo	yeah, we can't
2014-07-22 12:38:31	@Espyo	there's only one problem
2014-07-22 12:38:34	@Espyo	who owns these cards?
2014-07-22 12:39:02	@PikFan	what do you mean?
2014-07-22 12:39:20	@PikFan	you mean like, who added it?
2014-07-22 12:39:51	@Espyo	like
2014-07-22 12:39:54	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-07-22 12:40:00	@Espyo	it's just that I haven't seen these cards anywhere
2014-07-22 12:40:13	@Espyo	and somebody had to add the height and such, somebody with the cards
2014-07-22 12:41:11	@PikFan	well I doubt somebody would just come up with random values and add them
2014-07-22 12:41:20	@PikFan	you never know, but still
2014-07-22 12:41:56	@Espyo	I don't doubt it, there are nutjobs for anything
2014-07-22 12:41:59	@Espyo	but it is unlikely
2014-07-22 12:42:03	@Espyo	either way, we need that person
2014-07-22 12:42:08	@Espyo	or find them online, if they exist
2014-07-22 12:42:56	@PikFan	"The Silencer's treasure value was changed from 666 Pokos to 670 Pokos in all non-Japanese releases. The reason why should be obvious. If not, consult your local numerologist."

2014-07-22 22:29:26	@Espyo	what'd happen to the revisions when we merged?
2014-07-22 22:29:38	@Espyo	like, would it go like
2014-07-22 22:29:56	@Espyo	if we changed g with h, and then l with m
2014-07-22 22:30:08	@Espyo	and wikia changed g with b
2014-07-22 22:30:13	Mariostar123	Hey J
2014-07-22 22:30:19	@Espyo	it'd be like abcdefghijklm
2014-07-22 22:30:28	Meisterbot	what
2014-07-22 22:30:28	@Espyo	oh, and wikia's change is sandwiched
2014-07-22 22:30:38	@Espyo	then abcdefhijklm
2014-07-22 22:30:45	@Espyo	and then... there's no g to change to a b

2014-07-22 22:31:41	@Espyo	over here, we change the b with a v
2014-07-22 22:31:48	@Espyo	on wikia, they change the b with an x
2014-07-22 22:31:51	@Espyo	when we merge everything
2014-07-22 22:32:09	@Espyo	the edits will be like abc, and then the b is changed to v
2014-07-22 22:32:10	@J	it would be: A adds section 1; B adds section 2 to a page with no section 1; A modifies section 1; ...
2014-07-22 22:32:11	@Espyo	so avc
2014-07-22 22:32:24	@Espyo	then the b is changed to x, so... there is no b in avc
2014-07-22 22:32:38	@Espyo	hmm...
2014-07-22 22:32:57	@Espyo	so dupe edits would be purged by the system, and the rest...
2014-07-22 22:33:02	@Espyo	maybe we should try a test page, first

2014-07-22 22:33:49	@J	you would just get edits that don't start from the thing the previous edit ended up with

2014-07-22 22:37:52	@Espyo	then the edit history would be abc -> ... -> abcdefghiklmnop -> abcd?
2014-07-22 22:40:31	@J	yeah
2014-07-22 22:40:55	@J	except the diff between abcdef... and abcd doesn't show removing anything

2014-07-22 22:43:51	@Espyo	maybe one is the consequence of the other

2014-07-22 22:52:07	@Espyo	sounds like incredible overkill

2014-07-23 23:02:33	Meisterbot	mhm
2014-07-23 23:02:46	@PikFan	and he'd kill her for that?
2014-07-23 23:02:47	@PikFan	bah
2014-07-23 23:02:57	Meisterbot	yup lol
2014-07-23 23:03:13	Meisterbot	in this story i guess he's highly sensitive for attention

2014-07-23 23:05:16	Meisterbot	nice
2014-07-23 23:05:29	@Espyo	J: I have no idea what you said
2014-07-23 23:06:14	@J	the current talk page merge just concatenates talk pages and puts headings at the start, with empty titles where there's nothing obvious to use
2014-07-23 23:06:17	@J	*merger
2014-07-23 23:06:23	@J	so for redirects, you get something weird
2014-07-23 23:06:39	@Espyo	oh, wikia merge
2014-07-23 23:06:49	@J	yeah
2014-07-23 23:07:01	@Espyo	well, ignore redirects
2014-07-23 23:07:13	@Espyo	shouldn't be hard to add a filter to ignore anything starting with #REDIRECT
2014-07-23 23:07:15	@Espyo	case-insensitive
2014-07-23 23:07:28	@J	should probably put everything in the page it redirects to instead
2014-07-23 23:07:53	@Espyo	wait, talk pages for articles which are redirects?
2014-07-23 23:07:58	@Espyo	I thought this was redirect pages which are talks
2014-07-23 23:08:00	@J	no, the talk page is a redirect
2014-07-23 23:08:02	@J	yeah
2014-07-23 23:08:08	@Espyo	then I'm not following
2014-07-23 23:08:40	@J	so if one wiki has a redirect, and the other doesn't, I should put the content from the other wiki in the page redirected to
2014-07-23 23:10:52	@Espyo	oh, yes
2014-07-23 23:10:54	@Espyo	makes sense
2014-07-23 23:15:06	@J	not sure how much we care about Wikia's hierarchical comment system
2014-07-23 23:15:54	@J	the current behaviour gives you multiple headings, like: 'Comment: <user>-<timestamp>', then 'Comment: <user>-<timestamp>/@comment-<replying-user>-<timestamp>'
2014-07-23 23:16:06	@J	and not necessarily in the correct order
2014-07-23 23:17:58	@J	I could add with alphabetical sorting by page title
2014-07-23 23:18:04	@J	that should make it a little better
2014-07-23 23:19:36	@J	let me grab an example
2014-07-23 23:19:39	@Espyo	right
2014-07-23 23:20:41	@J	'#REDIRECT [[Talk:2-Player Battle (Pikmin 2)]]' + '#REDIRECT [[Talk:2-Player Battle]]' -> '== ==\n\n#REDIRECT [[Talk:2-Player Battle (Pikmin 2)]]\n\n== ==\n\n#REDIRECT [[Talk:2-Player Battle]]'

2014-07-23 23:20:42	@J	hah
2014-07-23 23:21:51	@J	oh, wait, now it's sorted the examples all happen in a different order
2014-07-23 23:22:07	@J	so I should add some code to give me a good example...
2014-07-23 23:26:34	@J	also I'm crazy

2014-07-23 23:38:53	@J	you, it would be possible to translate it into normal talk-page format, but lazy

2014-07-23 23:39:20	@Espyo	they teleport, I swear
2014-07-23 23:39:24	@Espyo	stupid random spawn locations
2014-07-23 23:39:34	@Espyo	how did you even...
2014-07-23 23:39:36	@J	spiders too
2014-07-23 23:39:43	@Espyo	yeah, spiders too
2014-07-23 23:39:54	@PikFan	and other stuff
2014-07-23 23:39:55	@Espyo	hmm, how could we make a simple and easy talk page format?
2014-07-23 23:40:10	@Espyo	here's a meh idea: call each section untitled conversation
2014-07-23 23:40:24	@Espyo	and then somebody would later go around transforming all of the "untitled conversation" instances in the wiki with a decent title
2014-07-23 23:40:37	@Espyo	it's just a little side-maintenance thing
2014-07-23 23:40:42	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-23 23:40:43	@Espyo	and even if it never gets done, it's not bad
2014-07-23 23:40:43	@J	I mean, they wouldn't have sensible titles
2014-07-23 23:40:53	@PikFan	why can't we have it the way it's always been?
2014-07-23 23:40:56	@J	but you could do the indentation and signatures in one section
2014-07-23 23:41:05	@PikFan	because the wikians would be uncomfortable with it?
2014-07-23 23:41:07	@Espyo	or even mix your "id" system with a keyword for machine-titled sections like mine
2014-07-23 23:41:08	@J	PikFan: I'm auto-merging Wikia talk pages
2014-07-23 23:41:14	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-23 23:41:51	@PikFan	I'm not quite sure I like the idea of giving each comment its own section
2014-07-23 23:41:54	@J	I should note, the headings you see are mostly generated by Wikia
2014-07-23 23:41:58	@J	I don't change them much
2014-07-23 23:42:06	@PikFan	it would clatter up the ToC
2014-07-23 23:42:17	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-23 23:42:19	@J	true
2014-07-23 23:42:22	@Espyo	yeah, the toc...
2014-07-23 23:42:25	@J	well, like I said, it depends how much we care
2014-07-23 23:42:31	@J	I can do it, it'll just take longer
2014-07-23 23:42:46	@Espyo	it'd probably be for the best
2014-07-23 23:42:58	@Espyo	shouldn't be that hard to identify replies to comments
2014-07-23 23:43:02	@Espyo	and from there, indenting is easy
2014-07-23 23:43:05	@J	the title could be something like 'Comment by <user> on <date>'
2014-07-23 23:43:12	@Espyo	yeah, that'd work just fine
2014-07-23 23:43:17	@J	I mean, that's the best I could autogenerate
2014-07-23 23:43:18	@Espyo	not as glamorous as a real title, but eh
2014-07-23 23:43:22	@Espyo	of course
2014-07-23 23:43:45	@Espyo	or, write a parser, lexer, grammar analyzer, etc. from scratch, and have it recognize what the topic of the conversation is about and title it accordingly
2014-07-23 23:43:58	@Espyo	or just join random bits from the conversation
2014-07-23 23:44:00	@Espyo	like Testyo

2014-07-23 23:47:54	Testyo	"Plant#Treasures_as_plants" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Plant#Treasures_as_plants
2014-07-23 23:47:55	@Espyo	THIS
2014-07-23 23:48:09	@Espyo	because it turns out I'm not quite sure what a plant /is/
2014-07-23 23:48:13	@Espyo	do leaves count as plants?
2014-07-23 23:48:16	@Espyo	do flowers?
2014-07-23 23:48:24	@Espyo	Wikipedia wasn't very helpful
2014-07-23 23:48:28	@J	parts of plants
2014-07-23 23:48:34	@Espyo	and apparently potatoes count as plants
2014-07-23 23:48:38	@Espyo	yeah, but
2014-07-23 23:48:45	@Espyo	is this like an arm not being a human?
2014-07-23 23:48:52	@J	...sure
2014-07-23 23:48:52	@PikFan	what about the fruits and vegetables
2014-07-23 23:48:56	@PikFan	they came from plants
2014-07-23 23:49:01	@Espyo	so Arboreal Frippery is a no...
2014-07-23 23:49:09	@Espyo	doesn't at least look like fruits are plants
2014-07-23 23:49:17	@Espyo	but stuff like spinach... should be... I think
2014-07-23 23:49:42	@J	except when they're growing, they have roots
2014-07-23 23:50:00	@Espyo	yeah, there you go, that's plant-like
2014-07-23 23:50:04	@J	the clover's probably near enough
2014-07-23 23:50:28	@Espyo	yeah, I think the clover is an actual plant
2014-07-23 23:50:38	@Espyo	I mean... you can't really categorize it as anything else
2014-07-23 23:50:46	@Espyo	whereas a fruit is a fruit, a tomato is a vegetable...
2014-07-23 23:51:14	@J	...close enough
2014-07-23 23:51:37	@Espyo	see, this kind of mess is really confusing
2014-07-23 23:51:49	@J	the way you say that, it sounds like you can't actually think of any fruits
2014-07-23 23:51:53	@J	that's how much you hate them
2014-07-23 23:52:00	@J	and then you go and call a tomato a vegetable
2014-07-23 23:52:26	@Espyo	I just changed the way I was approaching that sentence half-way through
2014-07-23 23:52:37	@Espyo	plus, I could cheat, and wouldn't even have to go anywhere: [[Fruit]]
2014-07-23 23:52:37	Testyo	"Fruit" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Fruit
2014-07-23 23:52:43	@PikFan	you two confuse me
2014-07-23 23:52:45	@Espyo	but... a tomato is a vegetable
2014-07-23 23:52:54	@PikFan	botanically it is a fruit
2014-07-23 23:53:05	@Espyo	I say we combine plant talk and programming to confuse PikFan even more
2014-07-23 23:53:18	@PikFan	oh, I see how it is

2014-07-24 00:36:58	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-24 00:37:32	@PikFan	hmm, I've noticed a lot of the users have rules on their talk
2014-07-24 00:37:39	@PikFan	I was the first to do that
2014-07-24 00:38:09	@PikFan	and also it seems many of them dislike swear words, as evidenced by their rules
2014-07-24 00:38:31	@PikFan	hah, I remember when I used to not like them
2014-07-24 00:38:36	@PikFan	now I swear fluently
2014-07-24 00:38:53	@PikFan	the other kids at my complex say that it seems wrong when I swear
2014-07-24 00:39:21	@Espyo	haha
2014-07-24 00:39:32	@PikFan	I... suppose it does
2014-07-24 00:39:41	@PikFan	given my reputation for kindness and caring
2014-07-24 00:39:49	@PikFan	anyway
2014-07-24 00:39:59	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-07-24 00:40:01	@PikFan	at least Ruddie is working on his game
2014-07-24 00:40:05	@PikFan	that's good
2014-07-24 00:40:14	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-07-24 00:40:57	@PikFan	gah, I wish patrolling edits on Fanon was like Pikipedia
2014-07-24 00:41:23	@PikFan	you just click the button, then get a notification that the edit was patrolled

2014-07-24 00:41:35	@Espyo	yeah, I noticed that some minutes ago
2014-07-24 00:41:36	@Espyo	ask Porple
2014-07-24 00:41:38	@PikFan	instead of having it send you to another page altogether
2014-07-24 00:41:45	@PikFan	I think I will
2014-07-24 00:41:47	@Espyo	you can always middle-click, though
2014-07-24 00:41:57	@PikFan	middle... click?
2014-07-24 00:42:13	@PikFan	click the mouse wheel?
2014-07-24 00:42:14	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-24 00:42:16	@Espyo	mouse wheel click
2014-07-24 00:42:24	@Espyo	if you do that on a link, you open it in a new tab
2014-07-24 00:42:31	@Espyo	and you get to keep the page you're on on the current tab
2014-07-24 00:42:37	@Espyo	unless you're using something incredibly old like IE4
2014-07-24 00:42:47	@PikFan	oh, cool
2014-07-24 00:42:50	@PikFan	didn't know that
2014-07-24 00:43:08	@Espyo	using it for the patrolled pages is probably one of the least useful uses for middle click
2014-07-24 00:43:11	@Espyo	ctrl+click also works
2014-07-24 00:45:17	@PikFan	loading times are really slow, ugh
2014-07-24 00:45:39	@Espyo	Fanon was fine, the times I checked today
2014-07-24 00:45:42	@Espyo	maybe your internet is just slow
2014-07-24 00:45:55	@PikFan	I don't think it's that
2014-07-24 00:46:05	@PikFan	Pikipedia usually loads faster than Fanon
2014-07-24 00:46:35	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-24 00:46:43	@PikFan	maybe it's because I'm middle clicking
2014-07-24 00:46:47	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-07-24 00:52:40	@Espyo	dunno then
2014-07-24 00:58:31	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-24 00:58:47	@PikFan	I had a weird dream last night
2014-07-24 00:59:10	@PikFan	I remember Ganon on horseback was chasing me around Hyrule Field
2014-07-24 00:59:20	@PikFan	nonetheless, it was a little scary

2014-07-24 12:17:19	@Espyo	hey
2014-07-24 12:17:35	@PikFan	jpmrocks was here a while ago
2014-07-24 12:18:02	@PikFan	I told him that J wanted to merge the talk pages
2014-07-24 12:18:07	@PikFan	(still confuses me)
2014-07-24 12:18:48	@PikFan	he said, in his opinion, it's unneeded to transfer talk pages
2014-07-24 12:22:07	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-24 12:22:08	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-24 12:22:14	@Espyo	it's worth a discussion, though
2014-07-24 12:22:21	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-24 12:22:24	@Espyo	they should talk between themselves
2014-07-24 12:22:33	@PikFan	why?
2014-07-24 12:22:52	@PikFan	the community is coming together again
2014-07-24 12:23:05	@PikFan	we shouldn't have to have separate discussions
2014-07-24 12:23:16	@Espyo	I mean, if they agree that all that's said on the wikia talk pages is like "HURR, ultra-bitter spray is better than spicy! we should put that in article1!"
2014-07-24 12:23:22	@Espyo	in that case, that could as well be forgotten
2014-07-24 12:23:31	@Espyo	but if important conversations happened, they wouldn't want to lose them
2014-07-24 12:23:54	@PikFan	right
2014-07-24 12:24:11	@PikFan	also, many other things are worth discussion, too
2014-07-24 12:24:16	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-07-24 12:24:23	@PikFan	many thins

2014-07-24 14:15:06	@Espyo	really
2014-07-24 14:15:09	@Espyo	really, Minecraft?
2014-07-24 14:15:16	@Espyo	one of the reasons the game is so slow
2014-07-24 14:15:25	@Espyo	is because it's rendering caves underground... when they're not visible
2014-07-24 14:15:31	@Espyo	it took them like 4 years to fix that?
2014-07-24 14:15:44	@Espyo	I honestly don't understand what goes on in mojang's mind
2014-07-24 14:16:00	@PikFan	06:15	Espyo	is because it's rendering caves underground... when they're not visible
2014-07-24 14:16:13	@PikFan	speaking of stuff off screen
2014-07-24 14:16:28	@PikFan	off-camera limbo doesn't work in Pikmin
2014-07-24 14:16:44	@PikFan	like
2014-07-24 14:16:48	@Espyo	yeah, here's the thing
2014-07-24 14:16:52	@Espyo	the off-camera limbo is a complete mess
2014-07-24 14:16:57	@Espyo	it... /kinda/ works
2014-07-24 14:17:02	@Espyo	something DOES happen, there's no doubt
2014-07-24 14:17:09	@Espyo	you don't even need to manipulate the game camera
2014-07-24 14:17:19	@Espyo	like, if you have a Dwarf Red Bulborb's health on the bottom of the screen
2014-07-24 14:17:29	@Espyo	and you slowly walk up so it goes off the screen from the bottom
2014-07-24 14:17:35	@Espyo	you'll see the health wheel blink
2014-07-24 14:17:46	@Espyo	this is the game only rendering the enemy and the health every other frame
2014-07-24 14:17:53	@Espyo	and if you go farther than that, it won't render
2014-07-24 14:18:04	@Espyo	won't make a difference, because you can't see the wheel or enemy if it were rendered
2014-07-24 14:18:06	@Espyo	but it just won't
2014-07-24 14:18:15	@Espyo	and then there's stuff like you wake up a Bulborb
2014-07-24 14:18:23	@Espyo	you let it chase you a bit
2014-07-24 14:18:30	@Espyo	and when it starts going back to its resting spot, run away
2014-07-24 14:18:46	@Espyo	and then when you come back later, you'll see it's still going to the spot, where it should've been sleeping already
2014-07-24 14:18:51	@Espyo	so stuff DOES happen off-camera
2014-07-24 14:18:53	@Espyo	or rather, DOESN'T
2014-07-24 14:19:03	@Espyo	but apparently... if Pikmin are involved, the game does everything
2014-07-24 14:19:11	@Espyo	like, Pikmin carrying stuff off-camera can still get eaten
2014-07-24 14:19:12	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-24 14:19:21	@Espyo	so I'm not quite sure how I wrote that "glitch"
2014-07-24 14:19:21	@PikFan	yeah, that's precisely what happened
2014-07-24 14:19:29	@Espyo	but the thing is, it's kind of a mess
2014-07-24 14:19:32	@Espyo	and also not really a glitch
2014-07-24 14:19:36	@Espyo	so maybe I could add it to [[Camera]]
2014-07-24 14:19:36	Testyo	"Camera" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Camera
2014-07-24 14:19:45	@Espyo	first, I'd have to really understand what happens and doesn't
2014-07-24 14:19:47	@Espyo	and for each game
2014-07-24 14:19:56	@PikFan	ugh
2014-07-24 14:20:02	@PikFan	that'd be a lot of stuff to test
2014-07-24 14:20:09	@PikFan	"a lot" doesn't even cover it
2014-07-24 14:20:30	@Espyo	and stuff like bosses could be active 100% of the time...

2014-07-24 18:24:50	@PikFan	at the end of the 3rd, you have to make a cloud near the launch star

2014-07-25 23:41:17	@Espyo	I implemented wall collisions in 5 minutes
2014-07-25 23:41:30	@Espyo	small problem: the walls are sticky https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47921869/sticky.gif
2014-07-25 23:41:33	@PikFan	and you thought it would take a lot longer

2014-07-25 23:41:40	@Espyo	which is great progress
2014-07-25 23:41:45	@Espyo	but here come the minor things
2014-07-25 23:41:54	@Espyo	like falling off of a high wall isn't really working
2014-07-25 23:41:56	@Espyo	plus the stickiness
2014-07-25 23:42:14	@PikFan	no, I don't think that they're sticky
2014-07-25 23:42:33	@PikFan	it's more like the Pikmin not following the leader until the leader is far away enough
2014-07-25 23:42:38	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-07-25 23:42:42	@Espyo	but that's not quite the thing
2014-07-25 23:42:53	@Espyo	like, you know how if you're walking forward and a wall closes in on your side
2014-07-25 23:42:56	@Espyo	you just slide along the wall
2014-07-25 23:43:03	@Espyo	here, just touching the wall is enough to stop you dead on your tracks

2014-07-26 00:39:15	Meisterbot	hello
2014-07-26 00:49:54	@Espyo	really wish the Doom source code had better documentation
2014-07-26 00:49:58	@Espyo	but from what I'm understanding...
2014-07-26 00:50:04	@Espyo	it does a lot more things than the engine does
2014-07-26 00:50:10	@Espyo	and yet still the engine runs a lot slower than Doom
2014-07-26 00:50:28	@Espyo	like, the engine currently runs at 90fps, if everybody's standing still
2014-07-26 00:50:35	@Espyo	with only 50 objects on the tiny map
2014-07-26 00:50:42	@Espyo	in Doom, you can have 300+ objects moving on a huge map
2014-07-26 00:50:47	@Espyo	and the game can reach 200+ fps

2014-07-26 01:05:45	@PikFan	wait, nevermind, got it to appear
2014-07-26 01:08:02	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-26 01:08:36	@PikFan	should I add Spotcaps and Kingcaps to the template?
2014-07-26 01:08:45	@Espyo	hmmm...
2014-07-26 01:08:50	@Espyo	we never added obstacle plants before
2014-07-26 01:08:56	@PikFan	they're fungi...
2014-07-26 01:08:59	Meisterbot	HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGDKSLNBJKFBGEI
2014-07-26 01:09:04	@Espyo	maybe have them stick to {{obstacles}}

2014-07-26 01:09:23	@Espyo	for one thing, when people want a list of plants, they think a list of decorative things, not obstacles
2014-07-26 01:09:34	@Espyo	secondly, funguses aren't plants
2014-07-26 01:09:39	@Espyo	I actually checked on Wikipedia
2014-07-26 01:09:46	@PikFan	well yeah
2014-07-26 01:09:48	@Espyo	when I created [[Plant]] and such
2014-07-26 01:09:49	Testyo	"Plant" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Plant
2014-07-26 01:10:02	@Espyo	stuff like the P2 mushroom treasures
2014-07-26 01:10:04	@PikFan	then why am I even asking this
2014-07-26 01:10:09	@Espyo	I checked, and because they're fungi, they're not plants
2014-07-26 01:10:25	@PikFan	maybe we should make a [[Fungi]] page
2014-07-26 01:10:25	Testyo	"Fungi" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Fungi
2014-07-26 01:10:27	Meisterbot	duh
2014-07-26 01:10:32	Meisterbot	its simple science
2014-07-26 01:10:40	Meisterbot	fungi and plants are not the same
2014-07-26 01:10:42	@Espyo	it even specifically said that fungi is a completely different thing from plants on Wikipedia, funny enough
2014-07-26 01:10:45	Meisterbot	even i know that
2014-07-26 01:10:50	@Espyo	it was like it knew what I wanted to know
2014-07-26 01:10:57	@Espyo	Meisterbot: not all of us are master botanists >_>
2014-07-26 01:11:01	Meisterbot	lol
2014-07-26 01:11:04	Meisterbot	but still
2014-07-26 01:11:10	@Espyo	yeah, it's a simple thing
2014-07-26 01:11:13	@Espyo	but I honestly didn't know
2014-07-26 01:11:14	@PikFan	yeah, fungi are in their own kingdom
2014-07-26 01:11:29	@PikFan	huh, you didn't know?
2014-07-26 01:11:34	@PikFan	interesting
2014-07-26 01:11:39	@Espyo	didn't know fungi =/= plants
2014-07-26 01:12:37	@Espyo	two of my friends just said they thought fungi were plants too
2014-07-26 01:12:57	@PikFan	hmm

2014-07-26 01:24:35	@Espyo	you're only meant to mark as patrolled stuff edits that are fine
2014-07-26 01:24:41	@Espyo	this edit isn't fine because we don't know what it is

2014-07-26 01:25:33	@PikFan	a while ago, I used to patrol edits that were fine, because that's what I thought I was supposed to do
2014-07-26 01:25:33	@Espyo	I read the template
2014-07-26 01:25:42	@Espyo	and that's not how the clash= should be used
2014-07-26 01:26:18	@PikFan	and then you told me to patrol all edits
2014-07-26 01:26:25	@PikFan	so I am doing that

2014-07-26 01:28:12	@Espyo	how EVEN
2014-07-26 01:28:24	@Espyo	I wrote an alarm on Testyo to remind me of the engine's 1-year birthday
2014-07-26 01:28:27	@Espyo	(Testyo can do alarms now)
2014-07-26 01:28:34	@Espyo	and one guy on the chat questioned what "engine" was
2014-07-26 01:28:37	@PikFan	I remember having a discussion about this
2014-07-26 01:28:38	@Espyo	I said it was my uncle
2014-07-26 01:28:40	@Espyo	he believed me

2014-07-26 01:28:46	@Espyo	I can't even

2014-07-26 01:29:17	@PikFan	you said it was your uncle, and he believed you???
2014-07-26 01:29:52	@Espyo	yes
2014-07-26 01:29:59	@PikFan	.....................................
2014-07-26 01:30:01	@Espyo	mind you, this isn't a channel where I just rarely talk
2014-07-26 01:30:02	@PikFan	what kind
2014-07-26 01:30:04	@PikFan	of idiocy
2014-07-26 01:30:07	@PikFan	I don't even
2014-07-26 01:30:11	@Espyo	that's my main channel, where I'm always pointing out the engine
2014-07-26 01:30:17	@Espyo	well, maybe not as often as here, but still quite often
2014-07-26 01:30:20	@Espyo	and I KNOW he knows
2014-07-26 01:30:23	@Espyo	the guy's just a complete mess
2014-07-26 01:30:31	@Espyo	we keep him around because he's funny because of that
2014-07-26 01:30:32	@PikFan	does he have mental health issues?
2014-07-26 01:30:38	@Espyo	honestly? he likely does
2014-07-26 01:30:44	@Espyo	which makes it kind of mena
2014-07-26 01:30:46	@Espyo	*mean
2014-07-26 01:30:49	@Espyo	but he insists he doesn't
2014-07-26 01:30:54	@Espyo	so it might be a case of him just acting stupid online
2014-07-26 01:30:55	@PikFan	for all we know he could be screwing around
2014-07-26 01:30:56	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-07-26 01:31:03	@Espyo	yeah, but he's been this way for years
2014-07-26 01:31:09	@Espyo	so if that's the case, A++ for commitment

2014-07-26 16:10:21	edub	I think the propeller goes missing because the game isn't supposed to put the propeller in the cut-scene, so it can't put it back in it's original spot, so it disappears.
2014-07-26 16:11:15	@Espyo	you mean the glitch in Pikmin 1?

2014-07-27 12:40:16	@J	[12:16:21] @J did we decide on what to do about archives?
2014-07-27 12:41:56	@Espyo	I thought we were gonna do the crazy mixed edit thing
2014-07-27 12:42:28	@Espyo	I can't really remember, but didn't one of the admins say they don't care much about the edit history?
2014-07-27 12:42:36	@Espyo	because, as far as we care, we really don't
2014-07-27 12:42:41	@Espyo	...that sentence makes sense in context
2014-07-27 12:42:49	@J	sure
2014-07-27 12:42:56	@Espyo	all they'd want the history for is to know who did what, right?
2014-07-27 12:43:08	@Espyo	nobody would want the history to revert it
2014-07-27 12:43:09	@J	though, just merging messes up our history
2014-07-27 12:43:23	@Espyo	because if there's any problem with a page, reverting wouldn't be the solution, fixing it by hand would
2014-07-27 12:43:24	@J	but yeah, all the individual edits are preserved fine
2014-07-27 12:43:27	@J	and in the right order
2014-07-27 12:43:33	@Espyo	the wikia pages must have lots of typos and such
2014-07-27 12:43:36	@Espyo	right, it'd mess it up
2014-07-27 12:43:39	@Espyo	that's why I was never a big fan
2014-07-27 12:43:57	@Espyo	maybe we should double check first if they really need the edit history
2014-07-27 12:44:23	@Espyo	one of them's online on Skype, I'll ask
2014-07-27 12:47:43	@J	we should
2014-07-27 12:48:00	@J	since that's how the license's attribution clause is respected

2014-07-27 13:06:49	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-27 13:07:05	@J	so did you say anything?
2014-07-27 13:07:23	@J	I think we were settling on just merging histories
2014-07-27 13:08:21	@Espyo	I questioned the license attribution clause thing
2014-07-27 13:08:25	@Espyo	because I have no idea what you meant
2014-07-27 13:08:35	@Espyo	and after that, all I did was complain that youtube stopped working on Firefox
2014-07-27 13:08:48	@Espyo	every time I tried to log in, it redirected me to the front page, still logged out
2014-07-27 13:08:52	@Espyo	at LEAST Chrome works
2014-07-27 13:10:35	@J	we use CC-BY-SA, which means any redistribution of the content has to be attributed properly
2014-07-27 13:10:54	@J	this is done using edit history
2014-07-27 13:13:21	@J	okay, so for main namespace pages, I'll use import, making sure to match up the names where they can be auto-detected
2014-07-27 13:13:50	@J	then I'll edit the page to replace it with the Pikipedia version (if there was one) and add a template saying it needs to be merge
2014-07-27 13:14:24	@J	and if the Pikipedia version existed, I'll put the Pikmin Wiki version at <page>/merge, which should be removed once the page is merged (the template will say this)
2014-07-27 13:18:07	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-27 13:18:59	@Espyo	you didn't make much sense
2014-07-27 13:19:03	@Espyo	first you say you'd import
2014-07-27 13:19:14	@Espyo	which would pretty much replace the pages and jumble the history
2014-07-27 13:19:21	@Espyo	and then you say you'd place the wikia version on /merge
2014-07-27 13:21:09	@J	yes, the histories get merged, then the _latest_ versions for Pikipedia and Pikmin Wiki go to the existing page and /merge, respectively
2014-07-27 13:23:23	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-27 13:23:35	@Espyo	so we really are going with the edit history spaghetti?
2014-07-27 13:26:27	@Espyo	so wait, by CC-BY-SA... that basically means we HAVE to keep the edit history somewhere? even if they say it's fine otherwise?
2014-07-27 13:41:54	@J	yeah
2014-07-27 13:42:14	@Espyo	yeah to both?
2014-07-27 13:42:18	@J	well, if every editor who's worked on the page agrees to relicense it, we don't
2014-07-27 13:42:21	@J	to the latter 
2014-07-27 13:42:32	@J	it sounded like you were for the spaghetti too
2014-07-27 13:42:41	@Espyo	I was, but if there were to be another way...
2014-07-27 13:42:49	@Espyo	well, I honestly don't care much
2014-07-27 13:42:53	@Espyo	nobody ever needs to check the history
2014-07-27 13:43:23	@Espyo	last time I checked a page's history was to see who added the claim that Jigglypuff can grow even larger if you hold B during Puff Up
2014-07-27 13:43:29	@Espyo	but even still, meh
2014-07-27 13:43:53	@J	hah
2014-07-27 13:44:13	@J	so to test stuff, I truncate all the pages so they print less
2014-07-27 13:44:19	@J	now one of the pages I got is:
2014-07-27 13:44:21	@J	'Does this need its own article? {{user:Jimbo Jambo/sig}}\n\nKind of. I can cook up a multitude of meth'
2014-07-27 13:44:22	Testyo	"user:Jimbo_Jambo/sig" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:user:Jimbo_Jambo/sig
2014-07-27 13:44:31	@Espyo	what?!
2014-07-27 13:44:34	@Espyo	how in the world...
2014-07-27 13:44:36	@Espyo	what page is that?
2014-07-27 13:44:43	@J	I'm thinking it's 'methods'
2014-07-27 13:44:49	@Espyo	not even a little bit of meth, just a multitude
2014-07-27 13:44:52	@Espyo	that's amazing
2014-07-27 13:44:59	@Espyo	sounded like something Testyo'd say

2014-07-27 13:46:14	@Espyo	hmm...
2014-07-27 13:46:18	@Espyo	funny how ambiguous that is
2014-07-27 13:46:31	@J	yep
2014-07-27 13:47:00	@Espyo	never really thought of it
2014-07-27 13:47:06	@Espyo	anyway, Testyo should probably be unserious to begin with
2014-07-27 13:47:07	Testyo	yes, I'm pretty sure I copy+pasted trillions of things in the meantime
2014-07-27 13:47:12	@Espyo	it's just that you never know when people can spam him around
2014-07-27 13:47:30	@Espyo	this is a chill chatroom that occasionally talks about Pikmin
2014-07-27 13:47:36	@Espyo	but it's not a freaking circus
2014-07-27 13:47:48	@J	well, I have been juggling a lot
2014-07-27 13:48:05	@J	also, I read that thing Testyo said as coming from you
2014-07-27 13:48:06	Testyo	no i didn't even copy you :|
2014-07-27 13:48:07	@Espyo	hm, besides that
2014-07-27 13:48:11	@J	because your names are the same length and colour
2014-07-27 13:48:16	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-27 13:48:22	@Espyo	Testyo's is a bit larger for me
2014-07-27 13:48:23	@J	and it took me some time to work out it was gibberish
2014-07-27 13:48:23	Testyo	that "couldn't it also be" makes it sounds like you think they're the sun meter is a complete disaster
2014-07-27 13:48:27	@J	you have an @
2014-07-27 13:48:31	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-27 13:48:50	@Espyo	it's so weird how he manages to make much more sense here than any other channel he's on
2014-07-27 13:50:28	@J	okay, so what I have left is: the main namespace and image merging strategies; and all import stuff
2014-07-27 13:50:30	@J	talk is done
2014-07-27 13:50:58	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-27 13:51:03	@J	though probably bugs
2014-07-27 13:51:27	@Espyo	for the main namespace (don't we just call it mainspace?), it's that spaghetti edit method, plus the /merge subpage
2014-07-27 13:51:42	@Espyo	as for images...
2014-07-27 13:51:51	@Espyo	you REALLY don't need to worry about them, I don't think
2014-07-27 13:51:54	@Espyo	pages get edited a lot, sure
2014-07-27 13:52:04	@Espyo	but when was the last time you've seen anybody upload an improved version of a picture?
2014-07-27 13:52:08	@Espyo	maybe a month ago, and only here
2014-07-27 13:52:13	@Espyo	nobody at wikia ever updates images
2014-07-27 13:52:20	@Espyo	that's me saying, but it's probably true
2014-07-27 13:52:28	@Espyo	and even if they do, it's like one picture per 3 months or so
2014-07-27 13:52:41	@Espyo	and as for editing the image page's content... pretty much the same, really
2014-07-27 13:52:53	@Espyo	so we should just upload new images, and ignore overwrites of existing ones
2014-07-27 13:53:32	@J	for images, I'll just save the conflicts to a file
2014-07-27 13:53:42	@Espyo	yeah, sounds good
2014-07-27 13:53:46	@J	same as talk
2014-07-27 13:53:56	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-27 13:54:01	@Espyo	but talk might be a lot different
2014-07-27 13:54:08	@Espyo	I'd say they edit talk pages as much as normal ones
2014-07-27 13:54:15	@Espyo	so there might be loads of conflicts
2014-07-27 13:54:21	@Espyo	and talks on existing pages that aren't on other ones
2014-07-27 13:55:38	@J	I think talk is working fine now
2014-07-27 13:55:51	@J	I'm generating a full dump now, so we'll see what we end up with

2014-07-27 15:42:37	@J	you have a comment, then replies to it

2014-07-27 15:43:38	@Espyo	but I thought they had thousands of wikia-style comments
2014-07-27 16:09:32	@J	I don't see the connection between where they are and how many there are
2014-07-27 16:10:04	@Espyo	because if the first one is only like 99% into the document
2014-07-27 16:10:23	@Espyo	that means only, at most, 1% of the entire wikia talk content is that comment style wikia thing
2014-07-27 16:10:27	@Espyo	unless this list isn't complete
2014-07-27 16:10:55	@J	wait, when you say 'the page', do you mean the page with all the articles on, or each article?
2014-07-27 16:11:12	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2014-07-27 16:11:20	@Espyo	when I said "page" at :43, I meant document

2014-07-27 16:12:40	@Espyo	I told Firefox to search
2014-07-27 16:12:49	@Espyo	and the first result was pretty much at the end
2014-07-27 16:12:49	@J	maybe you did case-sensitive and had a lowercase c
2014-07-27 16:12:56	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that too, but no
2014-07-27 16:13:01	@Espyo	match case is disabled

2014-07-27 16:13:12	@Espyo	no idea then...
2014-07-27 16:13:20	@Espyo	might've been that
2014-07-27 16:13:25	@Espyo	well, never mind, then

2014-07-27 17:38:07	@J	okay, I've got the conflict resolution working for main namespace pages, but I need to change it a bit to record redirects as moves, then actually do the moves
2014-07-27 17:38:17	@J	hmm...or something
2014-07-27 17:38:33	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-27 17:39:07	@J	what we would probably want instead is to 'unredirect' Pikmin Wiki pages, but that might be tricky
2014-07-27 17:40:08	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-27 17:40:31	@J	eg. on Pikmin Wiki,  redirects to B; on Pikipedia, we also have A

2014-07-27 17:41:32	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-07-27 17:41:39	@Espyo	though, chances are, we're the elite who know better
2014-07-27 17:41:44	@Espyo	so that redirect probably has no place being there
2014-07-27 17:41:51	@Espyo	(on Pikmin Wiki)
2014-07-27 17:41:53	@J	but maybe we want to import Pikmin Wiki's B to Pikipedia's A

2014-07-27 17:42:35	@J	need to account for double/triple redirects
2014-07-27 17:43:47	@J	actually, if I know what page I was supposed to be moving, then I already know where to put stuff
2014-07-27 17:44:27	@Espyo	or maybe report redirects and we can fix them individually
2014-07-27 17:44:29	@Espyo	there shouldn't be many

2014-07-27 17:50:25	@J	there are a _lot_
2014-07-27 17:50:59	@Espyo	I guess
2014-07-27 17:50:59	@J	hmm, how about when I add the template, I put the Pikmin Wiki page's original title in it
2014-07-27 17:51:11	@Espyo	you can ignore stuff that's both a redirect here and on Pikmin Wiki, though
2014-07-27 17:51:44	@Espyo	add the template where? on the redirected page?
2014-07-27 17:51:51	@Espyo	and which original title? the title of the redirect? on which wiki?
2014-07-27 17:51:56	@Espyo	*of which wiki

2014-07-27 17:53:42	@J	when we have a conflict - that is, a page from each wiki which have the same title, once we've resolved redirects (however we choose to actually do that) - I place a template on the Pikipedia page that we import the history of the Pikmin Wiki page into
2014-07-27 17:54:08	@J	and this would mention the title of the page on Pikmin Wiki that the merged content came from
2014-07-27 17:54:25	@J	which is now both merged into this page's history, and placed at <page>/merge
2014-07-27 17:55:29	@J	but first I need to do the washing-up, then make dinner, then eat
2014-07-27 17:55:34	@J	then probably laze around for some time
2014-07-27 17:55:43	@Espyo	wait, why would we merge AND keep /merge?
2014-07-27 17:55:51	@Espyo	I thought the /merge sub-page was only for before we merge
2014-07-27 17:55:56	@Espyo	I mean, merge CONTENT, not the edit history
2014-07-27 17:56:07	@Espyo	this is all a lot more confusing to explain and understand than it should be
2014-07-27 17:57:17	@J	we wouldn't keep merge
2014-07-27 17:57:27	@J	the template only exists to say that we haven't merged properly yet
2014-07-27 17:57:37	@J	we put the content in /merge to make it easier to find it

2014-07-27 17:59:01	@J	yeah, so it's just putting the title of the page in the template, in case whoever does the merge thinks there's a case for moving the page
2014-07-27 18:04:47	@Espyo	right
2014-07-27 18:05:00	@Espyo	but I'm just not getting what title goes where when it comes to redirects

2014-07-27 18:36:54	@Espyo	yeah, but this article is where they keep EVERYTHING spray-related

2014-07-27 18:37:19	@J	yes, I see that

2014-07-27 19:25:33	@Espyo	hey
2014-07-27 19:25:39	Prezintenden	yo
2014-07-27 19:25:49	@Espyo	can't remember if you know this, but
2014-07-27 19:25:56	@Espyo	the folks from Pikmin Wiki are coming to Pikipedia
2014-07-27 19:26:04	@Espyo	and hopefully this time, Pikmin Wiki will be abandoned
2014-07-27 19:26:08	Prezintenden	wow, what
2014-07-27 19:26:14	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-27 19:26:24	Prezintenden	how did that happen
2014-07-27 19:26:37	@Espyo	some days ago, I was on an editing spree
2014-07-27 19:26:43	@Espyo	there were a few neat articles I wanted to write
2014-07-27 19:26:49	@Espyo	about stuff like the [[Camera]] and whatnot
2014-07-27 19:26:49	Testyo	"Camera" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Camera
2014-07-27 19:26:58	@Espyo	not ultra-important, but still gameplay elements that are worth writing about
2014-07-27 19:27:02	@Espyo	and in the process I made hundreds of edits
2014-07-27 19:27:08	@Espyo	this caught the eyes of the Pikmin Wiki admins
2014-07-27 19:27:17	@Espyo	they sent me a PM on Pikipedia asking to talk to me
2014-07-27 19:27:36	@Espyo	they wanted to try to convince me to go there because where they boost in Pikmin 3 info, they lack in professionalism
2014-07-27 19:27:39	@Espyo	we arranged a Skype meeting
2014-07-27 19:27:43	@Espyo	and talked it all out
2014-07-27 19:28:00	@Espyo	and after a looooong talk, I convinced them that the community has to come together, and that that cannot happen on Pikmin Wiki
2014-07-27 19:28:15	@Espyo	they agreed, and told every regular at Pikmin Wiki that they'd be moving here
2014-07-27 19:28:24	@Espyo	J is currently working on his MediaWiki bot to help make the move
2014-07-27 19:28:55	@Espyo	they don't want us separated from them any more than they want themselves separated from us
2014-07-27 19:28:58	@Espyo	so we all want to come together
2014-07-27 19:29:04	Prezintenden	you're a greater man than i am
2014-07-27 19:29:09	@Espyo	it's just that they preferred we come to wikia
2014-07-27 19:29:21	@Espyo	and because that couldn't be the case, I just told them that it had to be the other way around
2014-07-27 19:29:28	@Espyo	thanks... I have to admit it was a hard battle
2014-07-27 19:29:32	@Espyo	I have the log, if you want to read
2014-07-27 19:29:35	@Espyo	it's pretty hefty, though
2014-07-27 19:29:36	Prezintenden	I totally agree that it's impossible to work with wikia, but I'm still surprised they agreed
2014-07-27 19:29:42	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-27 19:29:48	@Espyo	because, deep down, they just want a nice place to stay
2014-07-27 19:30:00	@Espyo	and to their eyes, Pikipedia was the group of guys that knew what they were doing, but were pretty cut off
2014-07-27 19:30:10	@Espyo	I had to tell them we were only cut off because the wikia split STILL brought people to wikia
2014-07-27 19:30:11	Prezintenden	i'll read it if you think i should, but otherwise not really
2014-07-27 19:30:19	@Espyo	there's no need to read it
2014-07-27 19:30:52	Prezintenden	crazy
2014-07-27 19:30:58	@Espyo	mhm, it was surreal
2014-07-27 19:31:06	@Espyo	it lasted until...
2014-07-27 19:31:08	@Espyo	let me check, even
2014-07-27 19:31:27	Prezintenden	I'm almost done with this semester so you might actually see me doing stuff again, wow! Prez best admin all years
2014-07-27 19:31:29	@Espyo	lasted until pretty much 2 AM, the talk
2014-07-27 19:31:34	@Espyo	hehehe
2014-07-27 19:31:45	@Espyo	wait, late july, really?
2014-07-27 19:31:51	@Espyo	are you doing finals and the like?
2014-07-27 19:32:58	Prezintenden	not sure what finals are exactly. I had courses until the 23rd and i have my final test on the 6th. but it's nothing crazy since I'm basically still in my first year of uni
2014-07-27 19:33:22	@Espyo	yeah, finals = final test
2014-07-27 19:33:24	@Espyo	final exam
2014-07-27 19:33:27	Prezintenden	are finals like... the test at the end of  a course to get the credits?
2014-07-27 19:33:31	@Espyo	yep, exactly
2014-07-27 19:33:32	Prezintenden	okay yeah, then finals
2014-07-27 19:33:42	@Espyo	at least that's the English name
2014-07-27 19:33:46	@Espyo	we really just call them "exams" here
2014-07-27 19:33:53	Prezintenden	yeah so do we
2014-07-27 19:33:54	@Espyo	mid-term tests are just "tests"
2014-07-27 19:33:59	@Espyo	finals are "exams"
2014-07-27 19:34:07	Prezintenden	yep that fits
2014-07-27 19:34:10	@Espyo	neat
2014-07-27 19:34:17	@Espyo	but all right, makes sense then
2014-07-27 19:34:31	@Espyo	meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what in the world these numbers mean
2014-07-27 19:34:33	Testyo	[Pikipedia RC] File:Pikminpressrelease.png uploaded by Sunmarsh (Official Pikmin Flower press release.) http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File:Pikminpressrelease.png
2014-07-27 19:34:42	@Espyo	it may not look like it, but there are like 5 types of ways enemies may fall from the ceiling in caves
2014-07-27 19:34:58	@Espyo	they may only fall if a Pikmin is nearby, or may only fall if a Pikmin is carrying something nearby
2014-07-27 19:35:02	@Espyo	and not fall otherwise
2014-07-27 19:35:08	@Espyo	except I'm still not sure what this one means
2014-07-27 19:35:21	@Espyo	there are no "names" for these settings, only numbers
2014-07-27 19:35:34	@Espyo	 5 = only spawns if a Purple Pikmin causes an earthquake nearby
2014-07-27 19:35:44	@Espyo	 4 = only spawn if a Pikmin is carrying something nearby
2014-07-27 19:35:49	@Espyo	 3 doesn't exist
2014-07-27 19:35:55	@Espyo	 2 = only spawn if a Pikmin is nearby
2014-07-27 19:36:00	@Espyo	 1 = ...?
2014-07-27 19:36:04	Prezintenden	captain?
2014-07-27 19:36:07	@Espyo	and nothing = always spawn when something is neabry
2014-07-27 19:36:09	@Espyo	*nearby
2014-07-27 19:36:13	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that, but it's hard to test
2014-07-27 19:36:19	@Espyo	I'll use Dolphin and savestates, should be easy
2014-07-27 19:36:54	Prezintenden	can you see how often the numbers are actually applied by falling objects
2014-07-27 19:37:26	@Espyo	well, the number is present for an item in the list of objects
2014-07-27 19:37:29	Prezintenden	yeah i guess that's basically what you're looking at if i understand this
2014-07-27 19:37:33	@Espyo	an item can refer to one enemy or 50 at once
2014-07-27 19:37:44	@Espyo	yeah, here's an example of an enemy in the game's files
2014-07-27 19:37:54	@Espyo	$1BombSarai_be_dama_blue_l 10 	# weight
2014-07-27 19:37:54	@Espyo		5 	# type
2014-07-27 19:37:54	@Espyo		
2014-07-27 19:37:54	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-07-27 19:38:06	@Espyo	(empty line for no reason)
2014-07-27 19:38:21	@Espyo	that "$1" before BombSarai means the Careening Dirigibug spawns from the ceiling
2014-07-27 19:38:28	@Espyo	but the $1 is what I'm still trying to figure out
2014-07-27 19:38:28	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-07-27 19:38:52	@Espyo	oh, and this is the file for the Sniper Room

2014-07-27 19:42:26	Prezintenden	so an item can contain spawn instructions for multiple enemies and there can be multiple items in a single sublevel?
2014-07-27 19:42:36	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-27 19:42:48	@Espyo	KareOoinu_s 30 	# weight
2014-07-27 19:42:49	@Espyo		0 	# type
2014-07-27 19:42:54	@Espyo	this refers to 3 figworts
2014-07-27 19:43:04	@Espyo	 3 small, withering Figworts
2014-07-27 19:43:05	Prezintenden	what... dropping figworts
2014-07-27 19:43:14	@Espyo	no, not all of these are stuff that drop from the sky
2014-07-27 19:43:18	@Espyo	only stuff that starts with $
2014-07-27 19:43:35	Prezintenden	oh so this is spawning in general
2014-07-27 19:43:40	@Espyo	yeah

2014-07-27 19:44:57	@Espyo	all right, I can't find anything different with the Careening Dirigibug in Sniper Room
2014-07-27 19:45:08	@Espyo	let me try the Fiery Dweevil in Hazard Training, because that also has a $1
2014-07-27 19:45:08	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-07-27 19:47:52	Prezintenden	is 0 type the "nothing"?
2014-07-27 19:48:01	Prezintenden	wait
2014-07-27 19:48:02	Prezintenden	ah
2014-07-27 19:48:05	Prezintenden	i'm so dumb
2014-07-27 19:48:09	Prezintenden	i get it
2014-07-27 19:48:10	@Espyo	heh, not really
2014-07-27 19:48:15	@Espyo	it's just hard to dive right in to these files
2014-07-27 19:49:50	Prezintenden	so what exactly does spawn if something is nearby mean. does that just mean "spawn no matter what" or does there actually have to be something like pikmin walking by
2014-07-27 19:51:10	@Espyo	if there's no $, it means it spawns like normal
2014-07-27 19:51:12	@Espyo	and it ALWAYS spawns
2014-07-27 19:51:27	Prezintenden	because that would make it obvious that 1 is something like olimar only. like not that you needed my deduction to figure that out but yeah
2014-07-27 19:51:58	@Espyo	unless the game is stupid and tries putting plants in a place where no plants can be
2014-07-27 19:52:07	@Espyo	I'm looking at you, [[Dream Den#Sublevel 8]] >_>
2014-07-27 19:52:08	Testyo	"Dream_Den#Sublevel_8" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Dream_Den#Sublevel_8
2014-07-27 19:52:16	Prezintenden	okay so $0 could mean it's enough if olimar walk by
2014-07-27 19:52:17	Testyo	$ 0 = 0 € / £ 0 
2014-07-27 19:52:39	@Espyo	if it has JUST a $, it means it falls from the ceiling when a Pikmin or leader gets close by
2014-07-27 19:52:52	@Espyo	if it has a number after the $, it means it only falls from the ceiling if the condition is met
2014-07-27 19:52:56	@Espyo	like a Pikmin carrying something nearby
2014-07-27 19:53:08	@Espyo	$0 doesn't exist, it's $1 I'm trying to understand
2014-07-27 19:53:09	Testyo	$ 0 = 0 € / £ 0 
2014-07-27 19:53:21	Prezintenden	gah yeah I'm using 0 instead of "nothing" sorry
2014-07-27 19:53:23	@Espyo	and yeah, "only fall from the ceiling if a leader is nearby" is a good guess... but it's not true
2014-07-27 19:53:41	@Espyo	yeah, nothing means it falls from the ceiling when a Pikmin or leader gets close, regardless of conditionals
2014-07-27 19:56:15	Prezintenden	consider 3 is unused it might just be a redundant of "nothing"
2014-07-27 19:56:41	@Espyo	maybe 3 means something, but it's just that no object has it
2014-07-27 19:56:49	@Espyo	it'd be nice to hack the game and spawn some $3 object
2014-07-27 19:56:49	Testyo	$ 3 = 2.2116 € / £ 1.8915 
2014-07-27 19:56:56	@Espyo	but the only people that apparently know how never reply
2014-07-27 19:57:02	@Espyo	wait
2014-07-27 19:57:04	@Espyo	what am I saying
2014-07-27 19:57:07	@Espyo	we CAN edit
2014-07-27 19:57:18	@Espyo	the problem is nobody really knows how to re-pack Pikmin 2 .szs files
2014-07-27 19:57:24	@Espyo	but these cave settings are NOT in .szs files
2014-07-27 19:57:37	Prezintenden	well i basically amounts to the same from a cleanness-of-code perspective, it's still rudimentary
2014-07-27 19:57:40	Prezintenden	*it
2014-07-27 19:57:57	@Espyo	we'll see
2014-07-27 19:58:02	@Espyo	the devs of Pikmin 2 are pretty forgetful
2014-07-27 19:58:07	@Espyo	they add stuff that's never used and such
2014-07-27 19:58:12	@Espyo	well, I'll abandon $1 for now and try to see what $3 does
2014-07-27 19:58:13	Testyo	$ 1 = 0.7372 € / £ 0.6305 
2014-07-27 19:58:19	@Espyo	sometimes I really wish I had the P2 source code...
2014-07-27 19:59:03	Prezintenden	I'm sorry i gave up on my dream of becoming a master hacker
2014-07-27 19:59:29	@Espyo	:(
2014-07-27 20:02:41	@Espyo	all right, I edited the files and the game didn't crash
2014-07-27 20:02:43	@Espyo	so that's always good
2014-07-27 20:03:16	@Espyo	loaded the cave without crashing...
2014-07-27 20:04:04	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-27 20:04:08	@Espyo	it fell from the ceiling

2014-07-27 20:08:42	@Espyo	there are so many tiny things that go unused in this game, it's amazing

2014-07-27 20:09:52	Prezintenden	so what makes you think 1 isn't captains <OR> pikmin
2014-07-27 20:10:01	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-27 20:10:12	@Espyo	I'm pretty sure I tried going with both leaders and Pikmin
2014-07-27 20:10:22	@Espyo	and the Careening Dirigibug appeared anyway
2014-07-27 20:10:24	Prezintenden	that is not how i wanted to convey that i meant the logic gate OR
2014-07-27 20:10:26	@Espyo	but it's worth a double check
2014-07-27 20:10:38	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-27 20:10:41	@Espyo	I thought you meant a XOR
2014-07-27 20:10:43	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-07-27 20:10:47	Prezintenden	no, exactly not :/
2014-07-27 20:10:53	@Espyo	right, right
2014-07-27 20:11:05	@Espyo	but the thing is, no number means appear with leaders OR Pikmin
2014-07-27 20:11:24	@Espyo	at least, I haven't seen stuff fall from the ceiling with anything else coming close
2014-07-27 20:11:30	@Espyo	ok, $6 doesn't exist
2014-07-27 20:11:30	Testyo	$ 6 = 4.4232 € / £ 3.783 
2014-07-27 20:11:33	@Espyo	the game crashed on the cave
2014-07-27 20:11:49	Prezintenden	and you think 1 just being the exact same is too unlikely
2014-07-27 20:12:13	@Espyo	well, now that I know what you mean...
2014-07-27 20:12:17	@Espyo	it's actually not that unlikely
2014-07-27 20:12:23	@Espyo	specially given that 3 is captains only
2014-07-27 20:12:27	@Espyo	 2 Pikmin only
2014-07-27 20:12:30	Prezintenden	i could've just written and/or, jeez. thank god i switched subjects
2014-07-27 20:12:32	@Espyo	 1 could be captains and Pikmin only
2014-07-27 20:12:37	@Espyo	hah
2014-07-27 20:12:59	@Espyo	let's see $0...

2014-07-27 20:14:10	@Espyo	I... can't find it
2014-07-27 20:14:27	@Espyo	and there should be 3 of them
2014-07-27 20:14:40	@Espyo	I replaced the purple candypops on Novice Training
2014-07-27 20:14:43	Prezintenden	maybe it spawned in a void
2014-07-27 20:14:50	@Espyo	heh, that'd be funny
2014-07-27 20:15:09	Prezintenden	try something that respawns...?
2014-07-27 20:15:13	Prezintenden	like treasure
2014-07-27 20:15:19	@Espyo	it's... not really appearing
2014-07-27 20:15:22	@Espyo	will do
2014-07-27 20:15:36	@Espyo	wait, better idea
2014-07-27 20:15:39	@Espyo	try EVERYTHING
2014-07-27 20:15:46	@Espyo	every item on Novice Training, I'll set it to $0

2014-07-27 20:20:40	@Espyo	uh, I know why it froze
2014-07-27 20:20:51	@Espyo	because when I removed the Margarets, I didn't update the number of entries
2014-07-27 20:21:17	Prezintenden	this is what happens when you play god

2014-07-27 20:28:43	@Espyo	yeah, that'd be really useful
2014-07-27 20:28:53	@Espyo	specially because I want to know the internal name of some Pikmin 1 enemies
2014-07-27 20:28:53	@J	but wait, can't you just extract the whole disk and create a new disk from that or something?
2014-07-27 20:29:17	@Espyo	and the ONLY way I have to do that is to replace an existing enemy's models with another one

2014-07-27 20:31:01	@Espyo	all right, I guess treasures can't have $0 or else the game crashes

2014-07-27 20:32:13	@Espyo	hm, true
2014-07-27 20:32:19	@Espyo	don't think they did, no
2014-07-27 20:32:37	@Espyo	maybe $0 is just messing with stuff that shouldn't work at all, but somehow does
2014-07-27 20:32:37	Testyo	$ 0 = 0 € / £ 0 
2014-07-27 20:32:43	@Espyo	and this behavior is completely random
2014-07-27 20:33:35	@Espyo	oh, Iridescents ignore the $
2014-07-27 20:33:38	Prezintenden	well actually maybe the game gets fussy if you remove the key
2014-07-27 20:33:41	@Espyo	so they always spawn on the ground like normal
2014-07-27 20:33:47	@Espyo	unless it's $0, in that case it'll just be a Glowcap
2014-07-27 20:33:48	Testyo	$ 0 = 0 € / £ 0 
2014-07-27 20:34:04	@Espyo	yeah, I thought that, so I tried re-adding the key and leaving the other treasures with $0
2014-07-27 20:34:04	Testyo	$ 0 = 0 € / £ 0 
2014-07-27 20:34:05	@J	that still makes me laugh every time

2014-07-27 20:38:14	@Espyo	and I did wonder what setting.ini that was
2014-07-27 20:38:19	@Espyo	might be somewhere
2014-07-27 20:38:54	@Espyo	woah, that's a bit dangerous
2014-07-27 20:39:02	@Espyo	I changed the cave size to only have one room
2014-07-27 20:39:08	@Espyo	and only 3 of the treasures showed up
2014-07-27 20:39:29	@Espyo	unless they have an stderr output that tells them some treasures weren't placed...
2014-07-27 20:39:38	@Espyo	but what if a cave can generate without chance of a certain treasure spawning?
2014-07-27 20:39:42	@J	or they have a checker that picks up things like that
2014-07-27 20:39:46	@Espyo	right
2014-07-27 20:39:50	@J	that's what I'd do

2014-07-27 22:56:11	@Espyo	and then ANOTHER Purple stomps the logo

2014-07-28 20:08:28	@Espyo	I don't get this
2014-07-28 20:09:05	@J	I had an interview that took more than 3 hours
2014-07-28 20:09:08	@Espyo	on windows 8, you can right click the explorer icon on the taskbar thing
2014-07-28 20:09:18	@Espyo	and it gives you a list of the most frequent folders
2014-07-28 20:09:27	@Espyo	you can use that to instantly open a folder you visit often
2014-07-28 20:09:28	@Espyo	except...
2014-07-28 20:09:36	@Espyo	it's not sorted by any reasonable method known to mankind
2014-07-28 20:09:37	@Espyo	like
2014-07-28 20:09:41	@Espyo	it's not the most frequently used folders
2014-07-28 20:09:46	@Espyo	it's not the most recently used folders
2014-07-28 20:09:49	@Espyo	it's not the least, either
2014-07-28 20:10:00	@Espyo	like, I open my playlist folder at least once every other day
2014-07-28 20:10:09	@Espyo	and it's probably the folder I open the most, bar the engine's folder
2014-07-28 20:10:15	@J	but why wouldn't you want a list of randomly asserted folders
2014-07-28 20:10:15	@Espyo	and it's like folder #7 on this list
2014-07-28 20:10:21	@J	*assorted
2014-07-28 20:10:23	@Espyo	I was going to open it again, and it was in place #8
2014-07-28 20:10:26	@Espyo	meanwhile, I open my SD card one time
2014-07-28 20:10:32	@Espyo	and it's in 1st place for like 3 days in a row
2014-07-28 20:10:32	Testyo	1 st = 6.3503 kg / 14 lb / 224 oz
2014-07-28 20:10:42	@Espyo	maybe that's it, it's random
2014-07-28 20:10:46	@Espyo	it randomly decides to add a folder
2014-07-28 20:10:50	@Espyo	and when it does, it plops it randomly

2014-07-28 20:11:01	@Espyo	you can also pin some folders so you make sure they never leave their place
2014-07-28 20:11:03	@Espyo	which is good
2014-07-28 20:11:11	@Espyo	but the thing is, it randomly forgets the entire list
2014-07-28 20:11:18	@Espyo	I still can't pinpoint WHY it does it, but it does
2014-07-28 20:11:32	@Espyo	anyway... more than 3 hours? what'd they do?
2014-07-28 20:11:35	@Espyo	submit you to tests and such?
2014-07-28 20:12:02	@J	I did a programming task, then it was just lots of talking, about everything
2014-07-28 20:12:18	@Espyo	any good movies recently?
2014-07-28 20:12:25	@Espyo	either way, what about recruitment action?
2014-07-28 20:12:33	@Espyo	...or any other name for the thing that's less stupid
2014-07-28 20:12:44	@Espyo	you know, you being sent in with other people who are also after the job, and doing tests and the like together
2014-07-28 20:12:50	@Espyo	a preliminary stage before the personal interviews
2014-07-28 20:12:58	@J	that didn't happen
2014-07-28 20:13:01	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-28 20:13:08	@Espyo	see, that did happen here, so I'm guessing they'll skip the test part
2014-07-28 20:13:08	@J	I haven't had any interviews like that
2014-07-28 20:13:23	@Espyo	oh, the recruitment action with every contender is days before the interviews
2014-07-28 20:13:29	@J	I had a couple of short phone interviews beforehand
2014-07-28 20:13:30	@Espyo	and only the best ones on that stage get interviewed
2014-07-28 20:13:40	@Espyo	oh, that's neat
2014-07-28 20:13:48	@J	but they decide the initial candidates using your letter and CV
2014-07-28 20:13:57	@J	and wait, movies?
2014-07-28 20:14:04	@Espyo	yeah, you said they questioned you about everything
2014-07-28 20:14:45	@Espyo	unless you're questioning the word "movies"
2014-07-28 20:14:48	@Espyo	...films, in that case
2014-07-28 20:17:58	@J	oh
2014-07-28 20:18:01	@J	mm
2014-07-28 20:18:17	@J	we spent a lot of time talking about what the job would be like
2014-07-28 20:18:24	@J	what sort of place it is, what the people are like
2014-07-28 20:18:52	@Espyo	hm, right
2014-07-28 20:18:55	@J	they wanted to know what kind of person I was

2014-07-28 22:46:27	@J	okay, I had way too many problems with it, but import from export dump works
2014-07-28 22:46:35	@J	now I just have to do the other import method

2014-07-28 22:47:14	@Espyo	hm, right
2014-07-28 22:49:28	@J	one problem was that I was testing it on my test wiki, which seems to be broken in various ways
2014-07-28 22:49:42	@J	and API requests don't see the error messages
2014-07-28 22:49:53	@J	it only prints them on user requests
2014-07-28 22:50:18	@J	also, MediaWiki doesn't like namespace prefixes on tags in the XML dump
2014-07-28 22:51:26	@J	the other import method should be easier, since it's only edits, which I've done before
2014-07-28 22:51:36	@Espyo	woah

2014-07-28 23:01:36	@PikFan	also hi
2014-07-28 23:01:55	@PikFan	so did anything happen yesterday?
2014-07-28 23:02:13	@Espyo	not really
2014-07-28 23:02:23	@Espyo	unless I'm forgetting...
2014-07-28 23:03:09	@PikFan	please don't tell me you're developing memory loss

2014-07-28 23:05:13	@Espyo	might as well just through it
2014-07-28 23:05:17	@Espyo	or else it'll never get done

2014-07-28 23:08:25	@PikFan	speaking of the engine, anything new?
2014-07-28 23:09:03	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-28 23:09:05	@Espyo	collisions are perfect
2014-07-28 23:09:11	@PikFan	yay
2014-07-28 23:09:30	@PikFan	so no more sticky walls?
2014-07-28 23:09:36	@Espyo	nope
2014-07-28 23:09:43	@Espyo	everything slides a lot more smoothly than I could've hoped for
2014-07-28 23:09:45	@PikFan	I see
2014-07-28 23:09:47	@Espyo	not too much, not too little
2014-07-28 23:09:51	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-28 23:09:59	@PikFan	anything else?
2014-07-28 23:10:02	@Espyo	two days ago, I just couldn't deal with it, my mind was too tired
2014-07-28 23:10:06	@Espyo	so I took a day of no engine
2014-07-28 23:10:13	@PikFan	mm
2014-07-28 23:10:17	@Espyo	and yesterday I went to bed sooner than normal so I had energy today
2014-07-28 23:10:21	@Espyo	and boom, I faced it cleanly
2014-07-28 23:10:30	@PikFan	nice
2014-07-28 23:10:32	@Espyo	hmm, other than that, not really much that's new
2014-07-28 23:10:42	@Espyo	I might be able to follow my plan of releasing the new version this week
2014-07-28 23:11:14	@PikFan	but with collisions, you can make walls now
2014-07-28 23:11:26	@PikFan	which means different levels
2014-07-28 23:11:29	@Espyo	I did have walls before
2014-07-28 23:11:31	@Espyo	walls came first
2014-07-28 23:11:37	@Espyo	collisions came some days ago, finished today
2014-07-28 23:11:42	@PikFan	oh, really?
2014-07-28 23:11:46	@Espyo	I've had walls for like 2 months now
2014-07-28 23:11:54	@Espyo	and through all this time I've been fixing ever smaller problems
2014-07-28 23:12:00	@PikFan	I didn't see walls in the engine
2014-07-28 23:12:03	@Espyo	yeah, didn't I show screenshots?
2014-07-28 23:12:04	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-28 23:12:08	@Espyo	let me check the Dropbox folder
2014-07-28 23:12:14	@PikFan	you did
2014-07-28 23:12:24	@PikFan	maybe my version is outdated
2014-07-28 23:12:26	@Espyo	I guess I never did show anything with walls
2014-07-28 23:12:31	@Espyo	that version has no walls whatsoever
2014-07-28 23:12:36	@Espyo	this version is a massive step u
2014-07-28 23:12:38	@Espyo	*up
2014-07-28 23:12:41	@PikFan	huh
2014-07-28 23:12:49	@PikFan	heh, yeah
2014-07-28 23:14:36	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-28 23:14:49	@PikFan	how will bridges work?
2014-07-28 23:15:11	@Espyo	earlier today, I woke up for some reason
2014-07-28 23:15:14	@Espyo	and before going back to bed
2014-07-28 23:15:17	@Espyo	I thought that question to myself
2014-07-28 23:15:24	@Espyo	and just stood blankly staring at the wall in shock
2014-07-28 23:15:29	@Espyo	because I have /no/ /idea/
2014-07-28 23:15:37	@Espyo	well, ok, that's an exaggeration, I kinda do
2014-07-28 23:15:40	@PikFan	hmmm...
2014-07-28 23:15:41	@Espyo	bridges are objects and...
2014-07-28 23:15:54	@Espyo	I'll just make object/object collisions act the same as object/wall collisions
2014-07-28 23:15:57	@Espyo	I'll get it to work
2014-07-28 23:16:47	@PikFan	will bridges be like P1/P2 bridges, made of wood, or P3 bridges, made of fragments?
2014-07-28 23:16:54	@PikFan	or can we choose?
2014-07-28 23:17:17	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-28 23:17:22	@Espyo	plans are only for P1/2
2014-07-28 23:17:25	@Espyo	but P3 shouldn't be impossible
2014-07-28 23:17:33	@PikFan	I see
2014-07-28 23:18:49	@PikFan	can we customize length?
2014-07-28 23:19:00	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-28 23:19:07	@PikFan	neat
2014-07-28 23:21:17	@PikFan	hey, Testyo is your IRC bot, yeah?
2014-07-28 23:22:53	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-28 23:23:39	@PikFan	if you devoted enough time and effort...
2014-07-28 23:23:54	@PikFan	he could also become a wiki bot
2014-07-28 23:24:20	@Espyo	well, they're two different things
2014-07-28 23:24:26	@Espyo	I'd be better off creating a new bot entirely

2014-07-29 20:40:56	Testyo	I will now stop fetching the recent changes from the wikis.
2014-07-29 20:42:04	@Espyo	I'll do the template, but first, dinner
2014-07-29 20:42:28	@J	it's probably just an extra argument to the API call
2014-07-29 20:42:55	@Espyo	oh yeah
2014-07-29 20:43:06	@Espyo	but I'd have to implement code to add ignores and such
2014-07-29 20:43:14	@Espyo	because I didn't patch the wiki updater in
2014-07-29 20:43:18	@Espyo	I added as a full feature
2014-07-29 20:43:28	@Espyo	except now I'll have to add a parameter to control the user exceptions and such

2014-07-29 20:48:43	@J	I'm not sure what you mean

2014-07-29 20:51:53	@PikFan	why did he copy the other page
2014-07-29 20:54:07	@Espyo	he dumb
2014-07-29 20:54:22	@Espyo	and every bot instance has its own wiki checker url

2014-07-29 20:54:27	@Espyo	I'm an idiot

2014-07-29 20:55:46	@PikFan	is J still figuring out stuff?
2014-07-29 20:57:37	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 21:00:33	@J	what should I do if a page is redirected on Pikmin Wiki but not Pikipedia?
2014-07-29 21:00:42	@J	eg. 2-Player Battle -> 2-Player Battle (Pikmin 2)
2014-07-29 21:00:45	@J	but we have the former
2014-07-29 21:02:08	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-29 21:02:19	@Espyo	probably nothing, but point it down
2014-07-29 21:02:26	@Espyo	so we can clear it on a case-by-case basis
2014-07-29 21:02:32	@Espyo	because I can't imagine there being many of this sort
2014-07-29 21:03:33	@J	yeah, I'm already adding original page titles
2014-07-29 21:03:44	@J	okay, I'll avoid moving any Pikipedia pages
2014-07-29 21:04:36	@J	...hey, do we care if I end up making a load of edits that do things like '#REDIRECT[[page]]' -> '#redirect [[page]]'?

2014-07-29 21:04:45	@J	could avoid it, but feeling lazy
2014-07-29 21:05:33	@J	wait, if we're not moving Pikipedia pages, we shouldn't have to write any redirects
2014-07-29 21:12:03	@Espyo	I wouldn't mind
2014-07-29 21:12:08	@Espyo	although uppercase is clearly superior
2014-07-29 21:14:44	@J	we may have to stop talking to each other
2014-07-29 21:17:17	@Espyo	I would agree that to be the case, provided you disagree with my clearly magnificent choice

2014-07-29 21:20:35	@Espyo	wait, it should be a disambig
2014-07-29 21:20:46	@Espyo	yeah, that one's the disambig
2014-07-29 21:21:06	@J	mode -> Battle, but Mode exists
2014-07-29 21:21:11	@Espyo	yeah, I see it now
2014-07-29 21:21:16	@Espyo	Mode is the disambig
2014-07-29 21:21:24	@Espyo	hmm, shouldn't mode be the disambig, though?
2014-07-29 21:21:30	@Espyo	because there is no mode officially titled "2-Player Mode"
2014-07-29 21:21:39	@Espyo	we only have that disambig page because of people who might think it's called that
2014-07-29 21:21:44	@Espyo	whether P2 or P3's 2P mode
2014-07-29 21:22:01	@Espyo	and "2-Player mode" would follow the guidelines better
2014-07-29 21:22:04	@J	yeah
2014-07-29 21:22:06	@Espyo	heck, "2-player mode" would even more
2014-07-29 21:22:16	@Espyo	PikFan: thoughts?
2014-07-29 21:22:29	@PikFan	we should find out what it's officially called
2014-07-29 21:22:37	@PikFan	err wait
2014-07-29 21:22:38	@PikFan	uh
2014-07-29 21:22:40	@Espyo	pfft
2014-07-29 21:22:48	@PikFan	we don't need to...?
2014-07-29 21:22:57	@Espyo	 "2-player mode" is not a thing
2014-07-29 21:23:02	@J	anyway, my code picked it up as an unresolvable conflict
2014-07-29 21:23:04	@Espyo	it's just a disambig for Bingo Battle or 2P Battle
2014-07-29 21:23:06	@PikFan	yeah, just now realized that
2014-07-29 21:23:10	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-29 21:23:21	@PikFan	there's a problem though
2014-07-29 21:23:29	@Espyo	question is just: "should it be 2-Player Mode, 2-Player mode or 2-player mode?"
2014-07-29 21:23:35	@Espyo	hmm?
2014-07-29 21:23:37	@J	last
2014-07-29 21:23:40	@PikFan	"2-player mode" could also apply to Challenge Mode and Mission Mode
2014-07-29 21:23:42	@Espyo	agree with last
2014-07-29 21:23:48	@Espyo	[[2-Player Mode]] we know
2014-07-29 21:23:48	Testyo	"2-Player_Mode" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=2-Player_Mode
2014-07-29 21:23:59	@PikFan	given that two players can play in those modes as well
2014-07-29 21:24:04	@Espyo	oh, it doesn't mention Mission Mode
2014-07-29 21:24:08	@Espyo	but that can be quickly added
2014-07-29 21:24:23	@Espyo	hmm, follow-up question
2014-07-29 21:24:39	@Espyo	 "2-player mode" or "2-player mode (disambiguation)"?
2014-07-29 21:24:41	@Espyo	wait, that doesn't make sense
2014-07-29 21:24:52	@Espyo	the "(disambiguation)" part only applies for articles with the same name
2014-07-29 21:24:54	@Espyo	like Pikmin
2014-07-29 21:24:57	@PikFan	...it doesn't seem like this is a disambiguation; rather, an overarching term
2014-07-29 21:25:03	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-07-29 21:25:08	@Espyo	but then again, we have stuff like [[Candy]]
2014-07-29 21:25:08	Testyo	"Candy" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Candy
2014-07-29 21:25:12	@Espyo	and [[Bulblax]]
2014-07-29 21:25:12	Testyo	"Bulblax" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bulblax
2014-07-29 21:25:26	@Espyo	in wikis, a disambig page is just a "did you mean..." page, really
2014-07-29 21:25:52	@PikFan	right, I know, but
2014-07-29 21:26:12	@J	it's something you search for that could mean multiple things
2014-07-29 21:26:19	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 21:26:23	@Espyo	we don't link to this page
2014-07-29 21:26:28	@Espyo	if we do, we did something wrong
2014-07-29 21:26:33	@PikFan	this 2-player mode article doesn't seem like a disambig page, given that most of its links are unrelated to each other, word-wise
2014-07-29 21:26:34	@Espyo	this is only for people who are searching
2014-07-29 21:26:54	@Espyo	but that's just it, it's not a conventional disambiguation of a term
2014-07-29 21:27:03	@Espyo	it's just a "by this, you meant one of these" type of page
2014-07-29 21:27:39	@PikFan	...so it's a disambig page, but not?
2014-07-29 21:27:53	@Espyo	it's a wiki disambig pages
2014-07-29 21:27:56	@Espyo	*disambig page
2014-07-29 21:28:12	@Espyo	I know what you mean, but
2014-07-29 21:28:21	@Espyo	we're not going to create another category of pages just for this type
2014-07-29 21:28:29	@Espyo	the... "branching path" type of page
2014-07-29 21:28:39	@Espyo	just because it's slightly different from a "disambiguation" type of page
2014-07-29 21:29:07	@PikFan	I wasn't asking you to make a new cat >_>
2014-07-29 21:29:19	@Espyo	I know, but it kinda implied that as a follow up
2014-07-29 21:30:14	@J	yeah, you're right, it's not quite what a disambiguation page is meant to be, but it's still useful, and fits in with the format well enough
2014-07-29 21:30:50	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-29 21:30:57	@PikFan	otherwise I'm fine with it
2014-07-29 21:31:15	@Espyo	anyway, as for the title
2014-07-29 21:31:27	@Espyo	(disambiguation) is only really used when there are multiple pages with the base name, like Pikmin
2014-07-29 21:31:40	@Espyo	this isn't the case, like [[Bulblax]], so I won't put (disambiguation) in it
2014-07-29 21:31:40	Testyo	"Bulblax" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bulblax
2014-07-29 21:34:14	@Espyo	there

2014-07-29 21:50:11	@J	guess I could look at GPBot contribs

2014-07-29 21:51:15	@J	I checked for a space at the end of that

2014-07-29 21:51:35	@Espyo	there's one between the comma and the yeah
2014-07-29 21:51:38	@Espyo	unless the server removed it
2014-07-29 21:51:42	@J	in the correction
2014-07-29 21:51:47	@Espyo	oh, according to Testyo, it did remove it
2014-07-29 21:51:54	@Espyo	...and it removed it in the correction as well
2014-07-29 21:51:55	@J	no I see 2 spaces
2014-07-29 21:52:00	@Espyo	Testyo sees one
2014-07-29 21:52:00	@J	but your correction has none

2014-07-29 21:52:34	@Espyo	I... don't really know what to think
2014-07-29 21:52:35	@PikFan	are you sure? there's a space after the -
2014-07-29 21:52:51	@J	hmm
2014-07-29 21:52:53	@Espyo	and PikFan sees it
2014-07-29 21:52:55	@Espyo	what in the world
2014-07-29 21:52:59	@J	okay, so everyone sees something different
2014-07-29 21:53:08	@Espyo	what a mess
2014-07-29 21:53:09	@J	test 
2014-07-29 21:53:10	@PikFan	clearly J is a dissident
2014-07-29 21:53:34	@J	okay, apparently end-of-line spaces just don't get printed for me
2014-07-29 21:53:48	@Espyo	nor for Testyo
2014-07-29 21:53:58	@Espyo	and I'm pretty sure I never wrote code to-- wait, did I...?

2014-07-29 21:55:04	@J	you quit
2014-07-29 21:55:06	@J	on purpose
2014-07-29 21:55:07	@PikFan	I... disconnected?
2014-07-29 21:55:14	@Espyo	no reason given
2014-07-29 21:55:16	@J	it gave a quit message
2014-07-29 21:55:19	@Espyo	looks like a manual disconnect
2014-07-29 21:55:23	@PikFan	odd
2014-07-29 21:55:25	@Espyo	yeah, the classic Mibbit one
2014-07-29 22:04:08	@J	okay, I think I can start merging
2014-07-29 22:04:40	@Espyo	go for it
2014-07-29 22:04:41	@J	mm...in a bit, I have some things to do
2014-07-29 22:04:51	@Espyo	don't think there's anything else we need to worry about
2014-07-29 22:04:55	@Espyo	oh yeah, the templates
2014-07-29 22:05:08	@PikFan	what about help pages?
2014-07-29 22:05:22	@Espyo	quick reminder, a template for the Pikipedia page saying that this page needs a merge, right?
2014-07-29 22:05:24	@PikFan	and other stuff
2014-07-29 22:05:32	@Espyo	all this talk about pages and redirects and whatnot back and forth... I really need a reminder
2014-07-29 22:05:35	@Espyo	PikFan: we do those manually
2014-07-29 22:05:40	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-29 22:05:42	@PikFan	okay
2014-07-29 22:05:53	@Espyo	plus, not like Pikmin Wiki has many of those quality control type of pages >_>
2014-07-29 22:07:00	@PikFan	so we start now?
2014-07-29 22:07:39	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 22:08:27	@PikFan	do we have the green light from the Pikmin Wiki admins?
2014-07-29 22:09:08	@Espyo	I asked ymmot, still waiting an answer
2014-07-29 22:09:10	@Espyo	nobody else's online
2014-07-29 22:09:54	@PikFan	alright, ping me when you get an answer
2014-07-29 22:11:07	@Espyo	if
2014-07-29 22:11:14	@Espyo	last time I told him something, I never got a reply
2014-07-29 22:11:41	@J	[20:38:43] @J okay, so we'll need that template
2014-07-29 22:11:41	@J	[20:39:18] @J one version for new pages, one for conflicts (either different templates or same with an argument)
2014-07-29 22:11:45	@J	[20:39:43] @J and it takes (another) argument giving the Pikmin Wiki page it comes from
2014-07-29 22:11:45	@J	[20:40:02] @J the conflict one should probably link to {{PAGENAME}}/merge
2014-07-29 22:11:46	Testyo	"PAGENAME" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:PAGENAME
2014-07-29 22:11:47	@J	[20:40:17] @J maybe fullpagename, I forget
2014-07-29 22:16:44	@Espyo	uh...
2014-07-29 22:16:56	@Espyo	ok, one for entirely new pages
2014-07-29 22:17:00	@Espyo	like P3 stuff we don't have
2014-07-29 22:17:11	@Espyo	oh, got a reply from another admin
2014-07-29 22:17:52	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-07-29 22:17:54	@PikFan	oh, good
2014-07-29 22:18:00	@Espyo	they're ready
2014-07-29 22:18:16	@Espyo	anyway...
2014-07-29 22:18:21	@Espyo	the "Pikmin Wiki page it comes from"
2014-07-29 22:18:25	@Espyo	I'm just not getting this part
2014-07-29 22:18:27	@Espyo	like
2014-07-29 22:18:36	@Espyo	for stuff like Red Bulborb, that's just a regular merge
2014-07-29 22:18:49	@Espyo	but where does the "Pikmin Wiki page it comes from" part come in?
2014-07-29 22:22:11	@J	like, merging their "2-Player Battle (Pikmin 2)" into our "2-Player Battle", the template says 'the Pikmin Wiki title was ...' or something
2014-07-29 22:22:19	@J	it's what you were saying about redirects
2014-07-29 22:22:35	@J	[21:00:33] @J what should I do if a page is redirected on Pikmin Wiki but not Pikipedia?
2014-07-29 22:22:38	@J	[21:02:19] @Espyo probably nothing, but point it down
2014-07-29 22:23:09	@Espyo	oh, I was thinking pointing it down on a piece of paper
2014-07-29 22:23:12	@Espyo	right, that works
2014-07-29 22:23:38	@Espyo	but for cases like that, there's no merge, only a template pointing down the old tite
2014-07-29 22:23:40	@Espyo	*title
2014-07-29 22:23:43	@J	pfft, paper
2014-07-29 22:23:46	@J	I don't even know what that is
2014-07-29 22:23:47	@Espyo	after which, we'll check for that template and manually merge
2014-07-29 22:23:50	@Espyo	obviously I meant virtual paper
2014-07-29 22:24:04	@Espyo	and virtual pens
2014-07-29 22:24:20	@J	no, I can tell that pages are the same because of redirects
2014-07-29 22:24:27	@J	so there is a merge
2014-07-29 22:26:05	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-29 22:26:47	@Espyo	all right, here's a simpler solution
2014-07-29 22:26:49	@Espyo	tell me what to do
2014-07-29 22:26:57	@Espyo	that way I don't have to burn my brain cells
2014-07-29 22:27:07	@Espyo	this is one of those things that's easy to know what's happening if you're doing it hands-on
2014-07-29 22:27:09	@Espyo	otherwise...
2014-07-29 22:27:16	@Espyo	it's like trying to explain other people your source code
2014-07-29 22:27:22	@Espyo	at best, you can give them headaches
2014-07-29 22:31:38	@J	You just need 'the title of this page at Pikmin Wiki title was {{{1}}}' and 'the Pikmin Wiki version can be found at [[{{PAGENAME}}/merge]]'
2014-07-29 22:31:39	Testyo	"{{PAGENAME}}/merge" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title={{PAGENAME}}/merge
2014-07-29 22:32:11	@J	with one template/version of the template for new pages, and one for conflicts (obviously the former doesn't need the /merge link)
2014-07-29 22:34:52	@Espyo	so... pages with a normal merge like Red Bulborb won't be using this?
2014-07-29 22:34:59	@Espyo	*won't be using any template?
2014-07-29 22:36:10	@J	they will
2014-07-29 22:36:30	@J	...maybe I should just make the template
2014-07-29 22:36:42	@J	I was trying to save some time, but I'm already failing at that
2014-07-29 22:38:00	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 22:38:01	@Espyo	sorry
2014-07-29 22:38:06	@Espyo	but again, source code analogy
2014-07-29 22:38:15	@Espyo	just use {{box|This page whatever}}
2014-07-29 22:38:16	Testyo	"box|This_page_whatever" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:box|This_page_whatever
2014-07-29 22:38:21	@Espyo	I'll prettien it up later
2014-07-29 22:39:05	@Espyo	it's already 22:30, you have to sleep soon
2014-07-29 22:39:09	@Espyo	so really, just type something
2014-07-29 22:39:19	@Espyo	meanwhile, I'm on their Skype group, and I'm chatting with the users
2014-07-29 22:39:51	Meisterbot	#skype
2014-07-29 22:39:59	@PikFan	how many users are on Skype?
2014-07-29 22:41:00	@Espyo	 23
2014-07-29 22:41:18	@PikFan	wow, that many?
2014-07-29 22:41:21	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-29 22:41:25	@Espyo	AND it's also a voice call
2014-07-29 22:41:29	@Espyo	I'm on text only
2014-07-29 22:41:33	Meisterbot	lol
2014-07-29 22:41:37	@Espyo	not for anything, but we DID just meet
2014-07-29 22:41:37	@PikFan	gah
2014-07-29 22:41:39	@Espyo	we = me + 23
2014-07-29 22:41:54	@PikFan	I don't understand why they use skype
2014-07-29 22:42:04	@PikFan	it's easier to use IRC
2014-07-29 22:42:15	@PikFan	you don't have to sign in or make an account
2014-07-29 22:42:24	@PikFan	you have to for skype
2014-07-29 22:42:42	@PikFan	sorry, I'm just frustrated
2014-07-29 22:43:19	@J	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Template:Merging
2014-07-29 22:44:30	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-29 22:44:35	@Espyo	it's the way they're used to
2014-07-29 22:44:36	@J	hey, you don't need to tell me to use box
2014-07-29 22:44:38	@J	didn't I make box?
2014-07-29 22:44:43	@Espyo	Skype does have the benefit of voice chat
2014-07-29 22:44:47	@Espyo	but yeah, IRC is more convenient
2014-07-29 22:44:50	@Espyo	we'll get them to IRC later
2014-07-29 22:44:52	@Espyo	it's not important
2014-07-29 22:45:12	@J	Skype only has one client
2014-07-29 22:45:17	@J	that's the difference that matters
2014-07-29 22:45:17	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-29 22:45:24	@Espyo	hmmm, that's also true
2014-07-29 22:45:31	@Espyo	one client that's consistent with cropping spaces and such
2014-07-29 22:45:49	@PikFan	14:44	Espyo	Skype does have the benefit of voice chat
2014-07-29 22:45:52	@PikFan	meh
2014-07-29 22:45:53	@Espyo	oh, only 3 are voice chatting
2014-07-29 22:45:54	@J	and it's all headless-incompatible and non-scriptable
2014-07-29 22:46:00	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-29 22:46:03	@PikFan	I don't like my voice
2014-07-29 22:46:11	@PikFan	not useful for me
2014-07-29 22:46:12	@J	yeah, a 23-person voice chat doesn't sound like it would work
2014-07-29 22:46:23	@Espyo	same
2014-07-29 22:46:31	@Espyo	@23-voice
2014-07-29 22:46:37	@Espyo	all right, ready to hit the button?
2014-07-29 22:46:44	@PikFan	button?
2014-07-29 22:46:56	@PikFan	...to merge?
2014-07-29 22:46:59	@J	oh, there are lots of buttons
2014-07-29 22:47:01	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-29 22:47:07	@Espyo	the big one, of course
2014-07-29 22:47:08	@J	I made it multi-stage, so I already started the fetching stages
2014-07-29 22:47:12	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-29 22:47:39	@J	user pages, should I migrate all of them (excluding conflicts)?
2014-07-29 22:47:45	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 22:47:54	@PikFan	let us begin
2014-07-29 22:48:00	@PikFan	our wikis shall now become one
2014-07-29 22:48:11	@J	I'm currently doing the user page dump and talk page merging
2014-07-29 22:48:19	@J	but...it'll take some time
2014-07-29 22:48:25	@J	and very possibly go wrong
2014-07-29 22:48:30	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 22:48:49	@J	talk page merging might have to run overnight
2014-07-29 22:49:26	@Espyo	pretty darn slow, that
2014-07-29 22:57:23	@J	it's lots of separate downloads
2014-07-29 22:57:38	@J	and two wikis with years of content
2014-07-29 22:57:49	@J	...or maybe it's already finished
2014-07-29 22:58:44	@J	a couple of the mergers, including for the main namespace, put the whole thing in memory - every page from both wikis
2014-07-29 22:59:09	@J	shouldn't be a problem, but I'm glad I have plenty of RAM
2014-07-29 23:01:52	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-29 23:12:20	@J	I think I'll start the actual imports tomorrow
2014-07-29 23:12:31	@J	so long as nothing goes wrong, I might actually finish
2014-07-29 23:12:42	@J	most of the exporting/merging is done
2014-07-29 23:13:21	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-29 23:14:52	@PikFan	going out now, but I'll be back in a few hours
2014-07-29 23:14:55	@PikFan	maybe sooner

2014-07-30 01:37:58	Meisterbot	wait
2014-07-30 01:38:01	Meisterbot	what
2014-07-30 01:38:23	@PikFan	just as there's two Pikmin wikis, there are two Pikmin Fanons
2014-07-30 01:38:34	@PikFan	the one we're on, and the other one on wikia
2014-07-30 01:40:09	@PikFan	we have to do something about the old Pikmin Fanon
2014-07-30 01:40:29	@Espyo	we'll do the same merge
2014-07-30 01:40:41	@PikFan	I see
2014-07-30 01:40:49	@PikFan	afaik there aren't any admins on Fanon
2014-07-30 01:41:04	@PikFan	that is, that weren't banned
2014-07-30 01:41:40	@PikFan	so I'm not sure how we'll tell the users on the old Fanon to move to the current one
2014-07-30 01:42:10	@Espyo	same way, really
2014-07-30 01:42:14	@PikFan	besides, wikia will smell a rat, and they'll go ban happy
2014-07-30 01:42:22	@Espyo	if they refuse, whatever, it's just a couple of people
2014-07-30 01:42:36	@Espyo	but they might come when they see the PWians are moving too

2014-07-30 18:56:47	@J	?
2014-07-30 18:56:56	@Espyo	yeah, it was today
2014-07-30 18:56:58	@Espyo	it went pretty well
2014-07-30 18:57:15	@Espyo	they probably heard some things they didn't adore, like how I couldn't really list a whole load of UML diagrams
2014-07-30 18:57:30	@Espyo	could only remember a flowchart, class diagram and...
2014-07-30 18:57:35	@Espyo	can't even remember what I said in 3rd
2014-07-30 18:57:42	@Espyo	but anyway, I nailed the part where they told me to speak a bit of English
2014-07-30 18:57:50	@Espyo	the guy was speaking with the classic Portuguese accent
2014-07-30 18:58:05	@Espyo	"Heh-low, ow arr ew too-deigh?"
2014-07-30 18:58:16	@Espyo	and on the other side, I was replying without any accent or stuttering
2014-07-30 18:58:19	@Espyo	it was great
2014-07-30 18:59:27	@J	you don't actually tend to speak English, do you?  Just read/write/listen, I thought
2014-07-30 19:00:16	@J	was English a job requirement for this job?  Or for such jobs in general?
2014-07-30 19:01:26	@Espyo	I speak English when I Skype with some British friends
2014-07-30 19:01:29	@Espyo	mostly while playing Brawl
2014-07-30 19:01:33	@Espyo	English was required, yeah
2014-07-30 19:01:46	@Espyo	they expect most applicants to be able to understand and speak English, but probably with some stuttering
2014-07-30 19:01:53	@Espyo	so I think I faired above expectations
2014-07-30 19:02:08	@Espyo	as for it being for such jobs in general...
2014-07-30 19:02:19	@Espyo	well, from the positions in other companies I noticed, that's pretty much the case, yeah
2014-07-30 19:02:27	@Espyo	but this one it's more mandatory than the others

2014-07-30 19:11:05	@PikFan	I wonder why he hasn't 
2014-07-30 19:11:17	@PikFan	or maybe he has, it's just taking time
2014-07-30 19:11:32	@Espyo	he might've, but he's just mute
2014-07-30 19:11:47	@PikFan	that too
2014-07-30 19:12:19	@Espyo	oh, on Skype they told me a funny story
2014-07-30 19:12:25	@Espyo	back when all we had were Pikmin 3 videos
2014-07-30 19:12:30	@PikFan	has he been on—ooh?
2014-07-30 19:12:35	@Espyo	they didn't know the name of the Face Wrinkler
2014-07-30 19:12:42	@Espyo	so they were kinda debating
2014-07-30 19:12:44	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-30 19:12:51	@Espyo	suddenly this guy comes up and says it's called the "Grenade of Life"
2014-07-30 19:12:56	@Espyo	and for some reason they believe it
2014-07-30 19:13:00	@Espyo	and make the page with that name
2014-07-30 19:13:02	@PikFan	(you know which one the Face Wrinkler is, right?)
2014-07-30 19:13:07	@PikFan	lolwut
2014-07-30 19:13:07	@PikFan	why
2014-07-30 19:13:36	@PikFan	also had a Pikmin dream last night
2014-07-30 19:13:39	@Espyo	later, an admin that had played the game — (the lemon) — at an event changed to "Face Wrinkler (demo name)" and locked the page so it couldn't be changed
2014-07-30 19:13:41	@Espyo	it was just a mess
2014-07-30 19:13:42	@Espyo	oh, neat
2014-07-30 19:13:51	@Espyo	and btw, yeah, J last talked like 5 minutes ago
2014-07-30 19:14:04	@PikFan	I was trying to find this very rare spray in Pikmin 2
2014-07-30 19:14:14	@J	I'm just making dinner
2014-07-30 19:14:18	@PikFan	it was like blue-colored
2014-07-30 19:14:20	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-30 19:14:25	@J	the transform for the main namespace is running, should take a while
2014-07-30 19:14:26	@PikFan	and could only be found in caves
2014-07-30 19:14:31	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-30 19:14:53	@J	I want to another template to put on the /merge pages, just to categorise them so we can find them all to delete them later
2014-07-30 19:14:56	@PikFan	I didn't know why it was special, all I knew is that it was
2014-07-30 19:15:29	@PikFan	then later, there was something about throwing captains in the Awakening Wood in NPC! P2
2014-07-30 19:15:48	@PikFan	that one was weird
2014-07-30 19:16:37	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-30 19:16:38	@J	hmm, the existing template could probably categorise too

2014-07-30 19:51:09	@PikFan	like, a few moments ago, there was the normal Frenzy bar, then a Clot bar, and a Click Frenzy bar
2014-07-30 19:52:09	@PikFan	so what are they doing?
2014-07-30 19:52:41	@PikFan	like, what do you mean, it seems "hugely expansive"?
2014-07-30 19:53:51	@Espyo	I mean Reddit, Miiverse, YouTube
2014-07-30 19:54:01	@Espyo	the communities from those places will all be pointed away from wikia
2014-07-30 19:54:05	@Espyo	everybody's in on this
2014-07-30 19:54:49	@PikFan	wow
2014-07-30 19:55:13	@PikFan	I still can't wrap my head around the fact that they /want/ to leave
2014-07-30 19:55:52	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-30 19:56:09	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-30 19:56:16	@PikFan	hey, you know how you made that list of wikia's low points, right?
2014-07-30 19:56:19	@Espyo	they just know they can't survive alone
2014-07-30 19:56:27	@Espyo	they have content, but they know they can't pull out quality easily
2014-07-30 19:56:28	@Espyo	they need us
2014-07-30 19:56:32	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 19:56:47	@PikFan	you could help them make a list
2014-07-30 19:57:05	@Espyo	hmm»
2014-07-30 19:57:07	@Espyo	*?
2014-07-30 19:57:07	@PikFan	and we can't exactly survive either
2014-07-30 19:57:23	@PikFan	we have quality, but little content (P3-wise)
2014-07-30 19:57:37	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 19:57:50	@PikFan	this split is bad for everyone
2014-07-30 19:58:00	@PikFan	we're about to bridge that split
2014-07-30 19:58:14	@PikFan	no... we ARE bridging it
2014-07-30 19:58:53	@PikFan	anyway
2014-07-30 19:59:09	@PikFan	so what you could do is make a list of their ideas
2014-07-30 19:59:14	@PikFan	like, for instance
2014-07-30 19:59:36	@J	hah, I found some cross-wiki redirect loops
2014-07-30 19:59:51	@PikFan	if you've got some sort of community, write down a plan on how to tell them not to go to the old site
2014-07-30 19:59:57	@PikFan	oooh, do tell
2014-07-30 19:59:59	@J	on Pikmin Wiki, Cardboard Box redirects to Cardboard box; at Pikipedia, it's the other way around
2014-07-30 20:00:37	@J	Poko and Rest Sublevel also have loops of some sort
2014-07-30 20:00:41	@Espyo	yeah, hehe
2014-07-30 20:01:06	@Espyo	yeah, but that's just a list of communities and places we could warn
2014-07-30 20:01:17	@Espyo	it doesn't have much to do with the wikia low point list
2014-07-30 20:01:20	@Espyo	...other than they're both lists
2014-07-30 20:04:40	@PikFan	I don't want it to be related to the wikia list
2014-07-30 20:05:23	@Espyo	PikFan> hey, you know how you made that list of wikia's low points, right?
2014-07-30 20:05:26	@Espyo	*<
2014-07-30 20:05:33	@J	might want to disable Testyo's wiki updater
2014-07-30 20:05:39	@J	if you haven't ignored bot edits
2014-07-30 20:05:47	@Espyo	oh, I haven't yet
2014-07-30 20:05:51	@Espyo	I'll see how to do it
2014-07-30 20:05:52	@PikFan	I was using it as an example
2014-07-30 20:05:58	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-30 20:07:16	@J	I've started user page improts

2014-07-30 20:14:02	@J	I guess we'll be sure in 5 minutes
2014-07-30 20:14:28	@Espyo	guess so
2014-07-30 20:14:39	@J	once user pages are don, I wonder if I should leave it for a bit to avoid overloading the wiki
2014-07-30 20:14:41	@J	*done
2014-07-30 20:14:54	@Espyo	see, now it forgot my playlist folder entirely
2014-07-30 20:15:01	@Espyo	that thing with the most frequent folders
2014-07-30 20:15:05	@J	that's about 1500 pages
2014-07-30 20:15:13	@J	hmm
2014-07-30 20:15:21	@Espyo	oh, but the Doom source code folder I opened once 3 days ago, and the only time before that was a month ago?
2014-07-30 20:15:27	@Espyo	that's folder #5 in the list, really important
2014-07-30 20:15:30	@Espyo	good grief...
2014-07-30 20:15:43	@J	why don't you file a bug report?  Oh wait...
2014-07-30 20:15:58	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-30 20:16:03	@Espyo	anyway, yeah, let the wiki breathe
2014-07-30 20:20:52	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-30 20:21:14	@PikFan	on [[Region]], do you think I should add {{for}}?
2014-07-30 20:21:14	Testyo	"Region" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Region
2014-07-30 20:21:24	@Espyo	for... what?
2014-07-30 20:21:35	@PikFan	because [[Area]]

2014-07-30 20:21:42	@Espyo	oh, right
2014-07-30 20:21:43	@Espyo	go ahead
2014-07-30 20:21:52	@Espyo	that'll also help test if the bot ignore is working
2014-07-30 20:22:08	@PikFan	may as well add it to [[Areas]]
2014-07-30 20:22:09	Testyo	"Areas" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Areas
2014-07-30 20:23:22	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-30 20:23:26	@Espyo	no, region -> area is more likely

2014-07-30 20:23:38	@PikFan	hmm, yeah
2014-07-30 20:23:42	@Espyo	yeah, keep the for on Region only
2014-07-30 20:24:02	@J	BTW, any edits you make now may get overwritten
2014-07-30 20:24:08	@J	especially moves and stuff will mess things up
2014-07-30 20:24:18	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-07-30 20:24:24	@PikFan	should I wait, then?
2014-07-30 20:24:27	@Espyo	well, they don't have Region, so...
2014-07-30 20:24:31	@PikFan	I haven't saved
2014-07-30 20:27:33	@J	if they don't have the article, it should be fine
2014-07-30 20:27:35	@J	but no promises

2014-07-30 20:28:18	@PikFan	you never responded
2014-07-30 20:28:38	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-30 20:28:44	@PikFan	brb
2014-07-30 20:28:45	@Espyo	uh, the "yeah" in my message after was also a "yeah" for that
2014-07-30 20:28:50	@Espyo	so... yeah, it's good
2014-07-30 20:31:21	@PikFan	oh, couldn't tell
2014-07-30 20:33:43	@Espyo	yeah, don't blame you

2014-07-30 20:42:55	@PikFan	this: http://www.pikminwiki.com/User_talk:Duriams
2014-07-30 20:43:25	@PikFan	"Your horrid Wikian grammar is showing"
2014-07-30 20:43:33	@PikFan	heh, we were so anti-wikia
2014-07-30 20:45:21	@Espyo	hehe
2014-07-30 20:45:43	@PikFan	they're going to find out some time
2014-07-30 20:46:03	@PikFan	they're going to find out all the resentment we've had for them
2014-07-30 20:46:16	@PikFan	I hope not soon, though
2014-07-30 20:46:37	@PikFan	I wonder if they disliked us for some time, too?
2014-07-30 20:46:49	@Espyo	they did
2014-07-30 20:46:53	@Espyo	they kinda said they did
2014-07-30 20:46:55	@Espyo	but it's all in the past
2014-07-30 20:46:59	@Espyo	plus we don't really hate the users
2014-07-30 20:47:03	@PikFan	I see
2014-07-30 20:47:05	@Espyo	just the general ambiance
2014-07-30 20:47:06	@PikFan	well yeah
2014-07-30 20:47:19	@PikFan	but curiosity...
2014-07-30 20:48:24	@PikFan	12:46	Espyo	plus we don't really hate the users
2014-07-30 20:48:33	@Espyo	except that guy, but he's a mongrel
2014-07-30 20:48:33	@PikFan	you did write "The community has less whiny kids."
2014-07-30 20:48:43	@Espyo	I meant that as the anonymous users, mostly
2014-07-30 20:48:49	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-30 20:48:50	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-30 20:48:59	@Espyo	remember, anonymous people who don't know a thing about how to do stuff tend to just search on Google for a wiki and go to the first resul
2014-07-30 20:49:01	@Espyo	*result
2014-07-30 20:49:09	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-30 20:49:20	@PikFan	I try to stay away from wikia, generally
2014-07-30 20:49:37	@PikFan	unless if it's like the only source of info for something
2014-07-30 20:50:01	@Espyo	same here
2014-07-30 20:50:02	@PikFan	there are good wikis out there, though
2014-07-30 20:50:21	@Espyo	if it's the only source, *shrug*, at least that means that both the bad and good users go there, because there's no alternative
2014-07-30 20:50:29	@Espyo	so at least you have some good stuff
2014-07-30 20:50:35	@Espyo	but if there are other sources, I try going there first
2014-07-30 20:50:35	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-30 20:51:51	@J	okay, importing user talk pages
2014-07-30 20:52:11	@PikFan	phase II
2014-07-30 20:52:12	@J	this has more chance of going wrong, so please check a few of the edits, see if you can spot anything off
2014-07-30 20:52:18	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-30 20:53:22	@PikFan	they're all missing User talk:
2014-07-30 20:53:25	@PikFan	all of them!
2014-07-30 20:53:46	@Espyo	...was this meant to be a template? http://www.pikminwiki.com/Merging_subpage
2014-07-30 20:54:19	@Espyo	yeah, dammit
2014-07-30 20:54:27	@Espyo	PikFan's right, the User talk: Prefix is missing
2014-07-30 20:54:33	@Espyo	HEY J
2014-07-30 20:54:41	@J	oh dear
2014-07-30 20:54:44	@PikFan	it's not his fault
2014-07-30 20:54:49	@PikFan	it's the ugly message wall
2014-07-30 20:54:54	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-07-30 20:55:07	@J	I was looking at that talk page you linked
2014-07-30 20:55:10	@Espyo	and you can't just delete them...

2014-07-30 20:55:23	@PikFan	dammit wikia, why did you have to create a HORRID user talk system
2014-07-30 20:55:25	@Espyo	you fix the bug, me and PikFan clean up
2014-07-30 20:55:33	@Espyo	PikFan: watch out for stuff like [[Waterwraith]]

2014-07-30 20:55:39	@J	wait, what are you cleaning up?
2014-07-30 20:55:42	@PikFan	yeah, I saw that
2014-07-30 20:55:46	@Espyo	deleting the pages
2014-07-30 20:55:51	@J	OH
2014-07-30 20:55:53	@J	I see what
2014-07-30 20:55:53	@J	...
2014-07-30 20:55:56	@J	how did that even happen
2014-07-30 20:56:07	@J	what was that about the message wall?
2014-07-30 20:56:08	@Espyo	you mean you only stopped it now?
2014-07-30 20:56:24	@J	I stopped when I saw you say HEY J
2014-07-30 20:56:36	@PikFan	I'm... laughing
2014-07-30 20:56:46	@PikFan	this is wonderful
2014-07-30 20:56:58	@Espyo	oh, ok
2014-07-30 20:57:20	@Espyo	so, me and PikFan will remove the pages
2014-07-30 20:57:25	@Espyo	PikFan can delete, can't he?
2014-07-30 20:57:27	@J	oh well, this was bound to happen
2014-07-30 20:57:29	@J	no, he can't
2014-07-30 20:57:29	@PikFan	no
2014-07-30 20:57:32	@PikFan	only on Fanon
2014-07-30 20:57:35	@Espyo	well, change that
2014-07-30 20:57:43	@PikFan	eh, it's fine
2014-07-30 20:57:51	@J	PikFan: nice
2014-07-30 20:57:59	@Espyo	well, I need help deleting them
2014-07-30 20:58:03	@J	best way to get Espyo to do all the work
2014-07-30 20:58:15	@Espyo	you're pushing my generosity here >_>
2014-07-30 20:58:15	@PikFan	...
2014-07-30 20:58:20	@Espyo	also, the Skype folk offered to help
2014-07-30 20:58:23	@PikFan	that isn't what I meant
2014-07-30 20:58:25	@Espyo	but they can't delete so *shrug*
2014-07-30 20:58:35	@PikFan	but the admin users can
2014-07-30 20:58:41	@Espyo	unless you have some plan to fix all of this
2014-07-30 20:58:52	@PikFan	if you feel like it, add me as admin
2014-07-30 20:59:56	@PikFan	...and move is broken
2014-07-30 20:59:57	@PikFan	fun
2014-07-30 21:00:28	@PikFan	no, it isn;t
2014-07-30 21:00:30	@PikFan	*isn't

2014-07-30 21:07:34	@Espyo	they saw the RC and nearly died
2014-07-30 21:07:41	@J	heh
2014-07-30 21:07:44	@J	hmm, okay
2014-07-30 21:07:44	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-30 21:08:02	@J	some talk merges might cause weird things to happen
2014-07-30 21:08:09	@PikFan	tell 'em to get on here
2014-07-30 21:08:09	@J	I'm looking at the edit to my archive
2014-07-30 21:08:18	@J	meh, it might get too noisy
2014-07-30 21:08:20	@Espyo	everything has its time, PikFan

2014-07-30 21:08:27	@Espyo	thanks Testyo
2014-07-30 21:08:46	@J	so, I'm detecting that talk pages are 'the same' by looking at the first part
2014-07-30 21:09:05	@J	but seems some talk pages have been edited, not just appended to
2014-07-30 21:09:11	@Espyo	that's not really a good thing
2014-07-30 21:09:15	@J	also, I take the larger one of the two
2014-07-30 21:09:16	@Espyo	because loads of them start with {{welcome}}
2014-07-30 21:09:16	Testyo	"welcome" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:welcome
2014-07-30 21:09:30	@J	oh, they have to have the same page name too
2014-07-30 21:09:56	@J	it's more to choose between concatenating the two pages, or using one of them
2014-07-30 21:10:15	@J	but yeah, here, the larger one means the one with links that were removed in the other
2014-07-30 21:10:42	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-30 21:11:04	@J	I'm wondering if a better approach would be: if one is significantly larger (maybe 20% larger, or 300 characters larger) then use that
2014-07-30 21:11:16	@J	otherwise, use the Pikipedia one, because it's probably smaller due to cleanup
2014-07-30 21:11:39	@Espyo	but cleanup is good
2014-07-30 21:11:43	@Espyo	also I got dinner
2014-07-30 21:11:53	@Espyo	you're going tomorrow, aren't you?
2014-07-30 21:11:57	@Espyo	you should probably hurry...
2014-07-30 21:12:12	@J	also, I told it to do 5 edits, but it seems to have only done 3...
2014-07-30 21:12:22	@J	yeah, okay
2014-07-30 21:12:24	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-07-30 21:12:33	@J	I'll implement that, though
2014-07-30 21:12:35	@PikFan	J's leaving?
2014-07-30 21:12:37	@J	I've got a few hours
2014-07-30 21:12:38	@J	for holiday
2014-07-30 21:12:43	@PikFan	oh
2014-07-30 21:13:30	@Espyo	a few hours might not be enough
2014-07-30 21:13:36	@PikFan	hey Espyo, can you get me a log from the Skype chat?
2014-07-30 21:13:47	@Espyo	what part?
2014-07-30 21:13:55	@PikFan	today
2014-07-30 21:14:01	@Espyo	ok, but what part? all?

2014-07-30 21:24:46	@PikFan	yay, dumb moment
2014-07-30 21:24:57	@J	okay, this should work okay-ish
2014-07-30 21:25:13	@J	better, anyway
2014-07-30 21:27:47	@J	...yeah, I shouldn't run this on the same page twice

2014-07-30 21:33:06	@J	okay
2014-07-30 21:33:14	@J	fairly sure the next attempt will only have minor silliness

2014-07-30 21:40:20	@J	I see a few double welcomes, but nothing horrible
2014-07-30 21:40:50	@J	user pages are relatively unimportant, so we're lucky they're the hardest ones
2014-07-30 21:41:04	@J	because of archiving, and welcome being a template we sometimes subst
2014-07-30 21:41:07	@J	and cleanups
2014-07-30 21:41:50	@J	hmm, though it seems some people were actually welcomed twice
2014-07-30 21:42:10	@PikFan	heh
2014-07-30 21:43:12	@J	hmm, places where the pages have diverged are hard to pick up
2014-07-30 21:43:28	@J	maybe I could've tried using a proper auto-merging engine or something
2014-07-30 21:43:47	@J	oh, hey, it's finished
2014-07-30 21:43:58	@J	that wasn't many
2014-07-30 21:44:36	@J	in fact, I'm suspicious
2014-07-30 21:47:58	@Espyo	back
2014-07-30 21:48:01	@Espyo	holy hell
2014-07-30 21:48:14	@J	?
2014-07-30 21:48:32	@Espyo	at the =w= =e= =l= =c= (...) =e= thing
2014-07-30 21:48:48	@J	yep
2014-07-30 21:48:52	@J	it's great
2014-07-30 21:48:58	@Espyo	anyway, we still need the mainspace pages
2014-07-30 21:49:00	@Espyo	...and the files
2014-07-30 21:49:04	@J	I know
2014-07-30 21:49:13	@Espyo	any plans?
2014-07-30 21:49:16	@Espyo	you can't do it all now
2014-07-30 21:49:21	@J	hmm
2014-07-30 21:49:47	@J	it's hard to only do some of it, to test it works
2014-07-30 21:49:56	@J	and I would like to know it works before passing it on
2014-07-30 21:50:20	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 21:51:14	@J	okay, I'll try to do 50 files
2014-07-30 21:51:19	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-30 21:51:26	@Espyo	err, we'll have to delete them later
2014-07-30 21:51:28	@Espyo	so... maybe 20?
2014-07-30 21:52:32	@J	it'll be trickier, because they're grouped in dumps of 50
2014-07-30 21:52:37	@J	but probably not too bad
2014-07-30 21:52:38	@J	so sure
2014-07-30 21:52:39	@Espyo	dammit
2014-07-30 21:52:43	@Espyo	but all right, do 50
2014-07-30 21:52:45	@J	wait
2014-07-30 21:52:50	@J	yeah, 50 will be easier
2014-07-30 21:53:17	@J	I could run the get again with a smaller dump size
2014-07-30 22:01:15	@J	starting now with 20; expect bad things...
2014-07-30 22:01:41	@Espyo	mhm
2014-07-30 22:02:20	@J	and when I say 20, I mean at most 20
2014-07-30 22:02:26	@J	it was 20 before removing conflicts
2014-07-30 22:02:44	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-30 22:02:50	@J	dump import seems to have worked, though I expected that to be fine
2014-07-30 22:02:59	@J	image import has 3 stages
2014-07-30 22:03:00	@PikFan	hmm?
2014-07-30 22:03:01	@PikFan	http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/Pikmin_Wiki:Code_of_Policies
2014-07-30 22:03:05	@PikFan	look at the comments
2014-07-30 22:03:10	@PikFan	rather, comment
2014-07-30 22:03:40	@Espyo	heh
2014-07-30 22:03:43	@J	yeah, they changed it some time ago
2014-07-30 22:05:18	@J	okay, the only problem is that the template additions didn't add whitespace before the content
2014-07-30 22:05:21	@J	no huge problem
2014-07-30 22:05:47	@Espyo	uh, only the actual file pages are being updated
2014-07-30 22:05:50	@Espyo	*uploaded
2014-07-30 22:05:53	@Espyo	the files are not
2014-07-30 22:06:11	@J	the files have been uploaded
2014-07-30 22:06:15	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:White.jpeg welp
2014-07-30 22:06:30	@Espyo	it's the first import
2014-07-30 22:06:56	@J	what's wrong with it?
2014-07-30 22:06:58	@Espyo	shouldn't the file page edit history be kept?
2014-07-30 22:07:02	@Espyo	it's nothing
2014-07-30 22:07:05	@Espyo	no file or description
2014-07-30 22:07:12	@Espyo	...it's fine now
2014-07-30 22:07:12	@J	bypass your cache?
2014-07-30 22:07:19	@Espyo	didn't even have to
2014-07-30 22:07:22	@Espyo	whatever *shrug*
2014-07-30 22:07:24	@J	the history is kept; there wasn't any
2014-07-30 22:08:20	@Espyo	not even the initial uploader?

2014-07-30 22:11:22	@J	oh
2014-07-30 22:11:28	@J	file history isn't preserved
2014-07-30 22:11:36	@J	I believe that's impossible without DB access
2014-07-30 22:11:46	@J	the page history is
2014-07-30 22:12:24	@Espyo	hm
2014-07-30 22:13:27	@J	okay, I should start telling you how it works
2014-07-30 22:14:00	@J	you call the script with 3 arguments: the source namespace, destination namespace (the same), and action
2014-07-30 22:14:25	@J	namespaces need to match known ones exactly or it'll crash (without doing anything)
2014-07-30 22:14:37	@J	action is 'get', then 'transform', then 'import'
2014-07-30 22:14:45	@J	ie. do all those things in order for each namespace
2014-07-30 22:14:50	@Espyo	numbers or names?
2014-07-30 22:14:57	@J	namespace names
2014-07-30 22:15:01	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-30 22:15:09	@Espyo	tried mainspace yet?

2014-07-30 22:15:19	Testyo	J is a flooder!
2014-07-30 22:15:29	@J	is where it looks up namespace
2014-07-30 22:15:49	@J	so main = ''
2014-07-30 22:16:04	@Espyo	what
2014-07-30 22:16:11	@Espyo	that doesn't even look like valid code
2014-07-30 22:16:18	@J	Windows command-line probably works in the same way - empty string arguments are '' or ""
2014-07-30 22:16:29	@J	so '<script> "" "" get'
2014-07-30 22:16:34	@Espyo	err... they might be
2014-07-30 22:16:37	@J	u'...' means unicode string
2014-07-30 22:16:41	@Espyo	oh, ok
2014-07-30 22:17:00	@J	Python 2 is a little weird with strings (but Python 3 fixed it)
2014-07-30 22:17:23	@Espyo	what about controlling how many get uploaded? for tests
2014-07-30 22:17:44	@J	I don't think we need to do any namespaces other than those
2014-07-30 22:17:58	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 22:18:02	@Espyo	templates probably go manually
2014-07-30 22:18:07	@Espyo	and the rest is meh
2014-07-30 22:18:09	@J	problem is, what's uploaded affects subsequent runs
2014-07-30 22:18:17	@Espyo	right, I know
2014-07-30 22:18:18	@J	have to do things like prepends
2014-07-30 22:18:25	@Espyo	but if I can test with like 5
2014-07-30 22:18:32	@Espyo	I can delete them before doing an actual run
2014-07-30 22:18:36	@J	if you revert them all, even successes, it should be fine
2014-07-30 22:19:00	@J	except that main and talk namespaces really need to look at every page for the 'transform' part
2014-07-30 22:19:14	@J	or they won't know everything
2014-07-30 22:19:18	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-30 22:19:27	@Espyo	what about the {{merging}} template and such
2014-07-30 22:19:27	Testyo	"merging" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:merging
2014-07-30 22:19:34	@J	what about it?
2014-07-30 22:19:41	@Espyo	is it added by the bot?
2014-07-30 22:19:44	@J	yeah
2014-07-30 22:19:57	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-30 22:20:57	@Espyo	when I start the file imports, I'll have to get rid of the images we have http://www.pikminwiki.com/Category:Merging_pages right?
2014-07-30 22:21:47	@J	I can send you my dumps, without the one I've already done
2014-07-30 22:22:09	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-30 22:22:14	@Espyo	aren't they huge?
2014-07-30 22:22:28	@Espyo	also, I should probably do a test here for mainspace things
2014-07-30 22:22:30	@J	not when compressed
2014-07-30 22:22:49	@J	yeah, I still need to test that
2014-07-30 22:23:04	@J	I'll send you what you need, you can see if you can get file running
2014-07-30 22:23:06	@J	I'll test main
2014-07-30 22:24:04	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-30 22:24:19	@Espyo	meanwhile, bathroom
2014-07-30 22:26:26	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/dist.tar.gz
2014-07-30 22:26:53	@J	so it should just be '<python2.exe> merge.py File File import'
2014-07-30 22:27:11	@J	and hopefully it actually works
2014-07-30 22:27:14	@J	oh...
2014-07-30 22:27:21	@J	you still have pycurl from before?
2014-07-30 22:27:46	@J	oh, also
2014-07-30 22:28:02	@J	before starting, you have to move the stuff from outputs next to merge.py
2014-07-30 22:28:08	@J	I separated them for no reason
2014-07-30 22:28:16	@J	and too lazy to make them need to be separate
2014-07-30 22:29:39	@J	one more note (I hope you can remember all this): any file that gets output that has 'failed' in it contains things that need to be dealt with manually
2014-07-30 22:29:56	@J	hopefully the titles are self-explanatory as to what was going on
2014-07-30 22:30:42	@Espyo	back
2014-07-30 22:30:55	@J	also possibly other files, but I think I put 'failed' in all of them
2014-07-30 22:31:21	@J	...oh
2014-07-30 22:31:25	@J	I accidentally'd
2014-07-30 22:31:51	@Espyo	I probably have pycurl somewhere
2014-07-30 22:32:06	@J	you'll need to turn the line near the end into: '        import_dump(strategy, src_info, dest_info, dest)'
2014-07-30 22:32:08	@Espyo	I don't have to remember, I can check the logs
2014-07-30 22:32:11	@J	ie. uncomment it
2014-07-30 22:32:22	@J	make sure that's spaces to indent, not tabs
2014-07-30 22:32:33	@Espyo	right
2014-07-30 22:32:35	@J	(of merge.py)
2014-07-30 22:32:39	@J	(I was testing a thing)
2014-07-30 22:33:06	@J	uh
2014-07-30 22:33:06	@J	...
2014-07-30 22:33:10	@J	okay, there's other stuff
2014-07-30 22:33:16	@J	don't run it, I'll send the file again
2014-07-30 22:33:21	@Espyo	hm, all right
2014-07-30 22:41:21	@J	........
2014-07-30 22:41:28	@J	may have sent you my bot account password
2014-07-30 22:41:30	@J	don't look
2014-07-30 22:41:51	@J	speaking of which, you might want a bot account
2014-07-30 22:44:27	@Espyo	oh, I was going to remind you to change it, but never did
2014-07-30 22:44:35	@Espyo	meh, wouldn't be the first time you splattered your password
2014-07-30 22:44:40	@Espyo	I'd be more worried about the others here, though
2014-07-30 22:44:43	@Espyo	they too can download the file
2014-07-30 22:44:49	 *	@Espyo looks at PikFan >_>
2014-07-30 22:44:51	@J	yeah, I deleted it from the server
2014-07-30 22:44:57	@Espyo	oh, that works
2014-07-30 22:44:58	@PikFan	?
2014-07-30 22:45:18	@Espyo	so, you said you fixed files, where do I download now?
2014-07-30 22:45:28	@Espyo	PikFan: the thing J linked to has his bot account's password
2014-07-30 22:45:29	@J	well...I tested to make sure it worked, and...
2014-07-30 22:45:31	@J	not great
2014-07-30 22:45:34	@Espyo	...
2014-07-30 22:46:27	@PikFan	uh
2014-07-30 22:46:33	@PikFan	confused
2014-07-30 22:46:41	@PikFan	well, carry on
2014-07-30 22:47:52	@J	okay, if you notice that it spends a lot of time on main namespace imports but no edits show up on the wiki,
2014-07-30 22:48:05	@J	I think that's because it's uploading lots of revisions that already exist at Pikipedia
2014-07-30 22:48:48	@Espyo	hmmm...
2014-07-30 22:48:52	@Espyo	so... just let it be?
2014-07-30 22:49:30	@J	yeah
2014-07-30 22:50:23	@Espyo	ok
2014-07-30 22:50:53	@J	did you find pycurl
2014-07-30 22:51:01	@J	and make a bot account?
2014-07-30 22:51:31	@Espyo	didn't try and no
2014-07-30 22:52:01	@J	you will need it
2014-07-30 22:52:14	@J	from when you were doing Carmageddon stuff; you had it then
2014-07-30 22:52:35	@Espyo	oh, I think it's already installed
2014-07-30 22:52:45	@Espyo	I thought it was a file you gave me along with the bot for Carma
2014-07-30 22:54:15	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/merge
2014-07-30 22:54:23	@J	okay
2014-07-30 22:54:35	@J	you need to delete the File files with 102
2014-07-30 22:54:37	@J	I just did them
2014-07-30 22:55:22	@J	well...that's very interesting
2014-07-30 22:55:51	@Espyo	with... 102?
2014-07-30 22:56:23	@J	for some reason .jpeg files aren't quite working right
2014-07-30 22:56:27	@J	but .jpg, etc. are
2014-07-30 22:56:48	@J	for .jpeg, the XML import and the edit go to a page without the extension
2014-07-30 22:56:50	@J	very strange
2014-07-30 22:56:52	<--	Ringtailed-Fox (Ringtailed@p57-35-8-400.home.cgocable.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-07-30 22:56:54	@Espyo	weird
2014-07-30 22:57:27	@J	well, that was the exported page title: no .jpeg
2014-07-30 22:57:54	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-30 22:59:10	@J	well, it's good to see non-ASCII titles are looking fine
2014-07-30 22:59:20	@Espyo	at least that's ok
2014-07-30 23:02:31	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin_3_Platinum_medal_Defeat_Bosses5_Mission_Mode_%E2%98%86%E3%83%94%E3%82%AF%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3_3%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3_%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E5%A4%A7%E4%BC%9A%E9%96%8B%E5%82%AC%E4%B8%AD%E2%98%86.jpeg dat name
2014-07-30 23:02:58	@J	ooh
2014-07-30 23:03:01	@J	they're not .jpeg
2014-07-30 23:03:03	@J	they're videos
2014-07-30 23:03:08	@Espyo	mpeg?
2014-07-30 23:03:12	@J	YouTube
2014-07-30 23:03:16	@J	special Wikia thing
2014-07-30 23:03:22	@Espyo	hmmmm
2014-07-30 23:03:27	@J	and the MediaWiki API is giving a thumbnail
2014-07-30 23:03:35	@Espyo	ah, I see
2014-07-30 23:03:46	@J	so...to fix it, I could probably use the given title on file upload
2014-07-30 23:03:54	@J	rather than use the one in the API response
2014-07-30 23:04:00	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-07-30 23:04:03	@Espyo	but do you have time for it?
2014-07-30 23:04:52	@J	hmm, I thought it would be easy but it might be tricky
2014-07-30 23:05:48	@J	okay, we just need to pick them up, then
2014-07-30 23:05:50	@J	 and probably delete
2014-07-30 23:05:58	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 23:06:19	@J	I can probably do that when I get back (since it's not urgent) by searching for files without an extension, then manually checking
2014-07-30 23:06:31	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 23:06:32	@J	okay, you can try to start with the filse
2014-07-30 23:06:33	@J	*files
2014-07-30 23:06:44	@Espyo	you said I should delete the 102 ones
2014-07-30 23:06:47	@Espyo	...there's only one 102
2014-07-30 23:06:55	@Espyo	unless each one represents a bulk of 50, like you said
2014-07-30 23:09:17	@J	yeah, I was thinking I sent you the export- files too
2014-07-30 23:09:20	@J	there's only 1
2014-07-30 23:09:23	@J	I had 2
2014-07-30 23:09:44	@Espyo	ok, so I delete 102
2014-07-30 23:09:47	@J	now, if you set DEBUG = True near the top of the file, it will only send one dump
2014-07-30 23:09:55	@J	and it will tell you how to deal with that
2014-07-30 23:09:59	@Espyo	oh, all right
2014-07-30 23:10:01	@Espyo	might as well
2014-07-30 23:10:08	@J	given the default DEBUG options set below
2014-07-30 23:10:25	@J	if you have a bot account, change the username
2014-07-30 23:10:35	@J	I guess just use Espyo otherwise
2014-07-30 23:10:40	@J	it will ask you for the password
2014-07-30 23:10:50	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-30 23:10:53	@Espyo	dammit
2014-07-30 23:10:56	@Espyo	rather make a bot account, then
2014-07-30 23:11:16	@J	yeah, you probably shouldn't use GPBot
2014-07-30 23:11:23	@J	for suspiciousness reasons
2014-07-30 23:11:59	@J	http://sprunge.us/LahF
2014-07-30 23:12:05	@J	I think I fixed the file thing in there
2014-07-30 23:12:09	@J	no, wait
2014-07-30 23:12:14	@Espyo	so, I'm doing the import command, now?
2014-07-30 23:12:14	@J	I'm crazy, we decided not to
2014-07-30 23:12:15	@Espyo	File File import
2014-07-30 23:12:23	@J	yeah, go for it
2014-07-30 23:12:35	@Espyo	should've asked for the password already
2014-07-30 23:12:37	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-30 23:12:42	@Espyo	it just took it a bit
2014-07-30 23:12:42	@J	uh, in case you didn't notice, the second time I sent the file you probably saved it as merge, not merge.py
2014-07-30 23:12:48	@J	oh, good
2014-07-30 23:12:48	@Espyo	well
2014-07-30 23:12:56	@J	first run probably takes a while to load all the libraries'
2014-07-30 23:12:58	@J	*-'
2014-07-30 23:12:59	@Espyo	I saved as merge.py, replaced
2014-07-30 23:13:05	@Espyo	well
2014-07-30 23:13:06	@J	okay, good, just checking you noticed
2014-07-30 23:13:13	@Espyo	l778 of merge.p
2014-07-30 23:13:15	@Espyo	*merge.py
2014-07-30 23:13:18	@Espyo	the one you told me to uncomment
2014-07-30 23:13:21	@J	here we go
2014-07-30 23:13:27	@Espyo	error on fns = [fns[0]]
2014-07-30 23:13:30	@Espyo	list index out of range
2014-07-30 23:13:39	@J	that's not what I told you to uncomment
2014-07-30 23:13:54	@J	and you didn't have to uncomment in the new version
2014-07-30 23:14:06	@J	 and that means you didn't move the files out from output
2014-07-30 23:14:13	@Espyo	I never did uncomment in the new version, actually
2014-07-30 23:14:15	@J	the 'output' directory
2014-07-30 23:14:17	@Espyo	dammit, I didn't

2014-07-30 23:16:32	@J	yeah, your account may be unprivileged
2014-07-30 23:16:36	@J	because you just made it
2014-07-30 23:17:07	@J	I was actually just improving that section
2014-07-30 23:17:14	@J	but it would still fail
2014-07-30 23:17:24	@Espyo	right
2014-07-30 23:17:28	@Espyo	well, change the permissions
2014-07-30 23:18:08	@J	autoconfirmed is 10 edits
2014-07-30 23:18:15	@J	I'll see what else I can add
2014-07-30 23:18:20	@J	patroller or something should do it
2014-07-30 23:18:22	@J	or just bot

2014-07-30 23:20:48	@J	import needs admin
2014-07-30 23:20:49	@J	...
2014-07-30 23:21:05	@J	there we go
2014-07-30 23:21:23	@Espyo	right
2014-07-30 23:21:38	@Espyo	well, it's moving
2014-07-30 23:21:47	@J	yeah, GPBot's admin, I forgot about that
2014-07-30 23:21:55	@Espyo	wrote upload failures to bla bla
2014-07-30 23:22:02	@Espyo	not sure if the script terminate-- there it goes
2014-07-30 23:22:04	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-30 23:22:14	@J	yeah, and hopefully it said some stuff about things
2014-07-30 23:22:24	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/File:Pikmin_2_Fuel_Reservoir_PAL.png err
2014-07-30 23:22:49	@Espyo	nice readability
2014-07-30 23:22:51	@J	like I said, import has 3 stages for files
2014-07-30 23:22:57	@Espyo	on all of those, permission denied
2014-07-30 23:23:00	@J	so each may have separate failed files
2014-07-30 23:23:11	@J	all?

2014-07-30 23:23:21	@Espyo	probably
2014-07-30 23:23:24	@Espyo	there's at least 30 here
2014-07-30 23:23:29	@J	yeah, all the uploads failed
2014-07-30 23:23:33	@J	that's beautiful
2014-07-30 23:23:40	@J	oh, hey, I never tested that code
2014-07-30 23:23:44	@J	nice that it worked
2014-07-30 23:23:48	@J	okay, yeah
2014-07-30 23:24:00	@J	beautiful: an admin can't upload if it's not autoconfirmed
2014-07-30 23:24:05	@J	you have 10 edits now, though...

2014-07-30 23:25:53	@J	then you should probably change it again
2014-07-30 23:26:02	@J	...or just tell me in private
2014-07-30 23:26:04	@Espyo	don't really see why that's important
2014-07-30 23:26:07	@Espyo	of course, just in private
2014-07-30 23:26:08	@Espyo	silly
2014-07-30 23:26:25	@Espyo	but even still, if you don't want me knowing your regular GPBot password, you can change it real quick
2014-07-30 23:27:01	@J	I meant you can tell me what to change it to in private
2014-07-30 23:27:08	@Espyo	oh, that works
2014-07-30 23:28:02	@Espyo	don't I have to delete the pages the bot created?
2014-07-30 23:28:13	@J	or comment out some code
2014-07-30 23:28:18	@J	that could go wrong
2014-07-30 23:28:21	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-07-30 23:28:28	@J	delete is probably easier
2014-07-30 23:28:40	@Espyo	as per the warning...
2014-07-30 23:28:43	@Espyo	I have to remove the dump file
2014-07-30 23:28:54	@Espyo	and... save or deal with the failed outputs
2014-07-30 23:28:57	@Espyo	well, that one doesn't matter
2014-07-30 23:29:19	@J	that's if it succeeded
2014-07-30 23:29:28	@J	either do that _or_ undo your changes
2014-07-30 23:29:41	@J	probably want to remove failed outputs, because it won't delete them on success
2014-07-30 23:31:01	@Espyo	"remove failed outputs": delete the failed uploads on the wiki?
2014-07-30 23:31:36	@J	no, that refers to the output files
2014-07-30 23:31:42	@Espyo	ah, right
2014-07-30 23:31:45	@J	the appropriate files with 'failed' in their name
2014-07-30 23:31:50	@Espyo	ok
2014-07-30 23:31:57	@J	because they'll get overwritten next run
2014-07-30 23:32:12	@Espyo	where are they?
2014-07-30 23:33:12	@J	next to merge.py
2014-07-30 23:33:23	@J	...this is probably easier with a shell
2014-07-30 23:33:46	@J	like, 'ls *failed*'
2014-07-30 23:33:57	@J	http://sprunge.us/cLcQ
2014-07-30 23:34:02	@J	this might be more resilient
2014-07-30 23:34:10	@Espyo	...none of them are called that
2014-07-30 23:34:18	@Espyo	I mean, match that mask
2014-07-30 23:34:27	@Espyo	there is nothing with "failed" in the file name
2014-07-30 23:34:33	@Espyo	(I can use windows' search feature)
2014-07-30 23:34:49	@J	then nothing failed
2014-07-30 23:34:52	@J	uh...
2014-07-30 23:34:54	@J	except it did
2014-07-30 23:34:57	@Espyo	even though we clearly saw...
2014-07-30 23:34:58	@J	you said it said it failed
2014-07-30 23:35:10	@Espyo	there's this, but importimgfailed-mergeimg-File-File
2014-07-30 23:35:11	@J	does Windows even support *?
2014-07-30 23:35:13	@Espyo	this is just the report
2014-07-30 23:35:15	@J	yeah, that
2014-07-30 23:35:18	@Espyo	windows does, yeah
2014-07-30 23:35:26	@J	that file doesn't exist?
2014-07-30 23:35:30	@Espyo	that's not an "output"!
2014-07-30 23:35:32	@Espyo	that's just a report!
2014-07-30 23:35:36	@Espyo	dammit J, name your things better :|
2014-07-30 23:35:38	@J	an output report
2014-07-30 23:35:44	@Espyo	I thought this was either an import or export file
2014-07-30 23:35:48	@Espyo	like the hundreds here
2014-07-30 23:36:03	@J	hey, everything's an output
2014-07-30 23:36:08	@Espyo	yeah, but
2014-07-30 23:36:20	@Espyo	why in the world would I think of having to delete the error log
2014-07-30 23:36:40	@Espyo	all right, trying again...
2014-07-30 23:36:43	@Espyo	no errors so far
2014-07-30 23:37:18	@J	well, I guess just that one dump file did weird things
2014-07-30 23:37:31	@J	for main, that is
2014-07-30 23:37:38	@J	it seems to be working
2014-07-30 23:37:50	@J	so I'll send you my main dumps, since they took some time to generate
2014-07-30 23:37:53	@Espyo	I think the internet fainted for a sec
2014-07-30 23:37:57	@J	...and everything else, while I'm at it
2014-07-30 23:38:34	@Espyo	wait, what are the uploads?
2014-07-30 23:38:59	@Espyo	all of THOSE?!
2014-07-30 23:39:07	@Espyo	I thought this was a test for 10, not 100
2014-07-30 23:39:16	@J	hmm?
2014-07-30 23:39:24	@J	I was doing some too
2014-07-30 23:39:32	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-30 23:39:44	@Espyo	can't really tell which ones were me, then
2014-07-30 23:39:45	@J	notice the different namespaces
2014-07-30 23:39:53	@Espyo	like, I see no uploads
2014-07-30 23:39:55	@J	I've stopped now anyway
2014-07-30 23:40:00	@Espyo	yeah, I see the different namespaces now
2014-07-30 23:40:05	@Espyo	but I can't find any actu-- oh, there's one
2014-07-30 23:40:25	@J	if you tick 'only show latest revision edits' or something
2014-07-30 23:40:30	@Espyo	hm
2014-07-30 23:40:30	@J	they're grouped by page
2014-07-30 23:40:47	@J	makes it harder to track in failure cases, but easier when stuff is working
2014-07-30 23:40:54	@Espyo	all right, it does look like it's working
2014-07-30 23:40:58	@Espyo	in that case... what do I do tomorrow?
2014-07-30 23:41:05	@Espyo	same thing, but with debug off?
2014-07-30 23:41:12	@Espyo	and... just like that, we have the images, right?
2014-07-30 23:42:35	@J	yeah
2014-07-30 23:42:41	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-30 23:42:43	@J	so, as for progress
2014-07-30 23:42:45	@J	user talk is done
2014-07-30 23:42:46	@Espyo	as for now, what do I have to delete?
2014-07-30 23:42:58	@J	get and transform is done for everything, I think
2014-07-30 23:43:01	@J	(in what I'm sending you)
2014-07-30 23:43:08	@J	but they can still be run if you need them
2014-07-30 23:43:15	@Espyo	what are get and transform for?
2014-07-30 23:43:19	@J	I hope talk imports still work
2014-07-30 23:43:23	@J	they generate the dumps
2014-07-30 23:43:29	@J	export-*, import-*, importjson-*
2014-07-30 23:43:31	@Espyo	ah, right
2014-07-30 23:44:02	@J	I believe importjson hasn't been tested with the latest version, so you should test that before I go
2014-07-30 23:44:19	@J	I hope 7-zip knows xz
2014-07-30 23:44:23	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-30 23:44:25	@J	because it gets me 3x the compression
2014-07-30 23:44:29	@Espyo	sweet
2014-07-30 23:44:31	@J	and it's .5G uncompressed
2014-07-30 23:44:47	@Espyo	youch
2014-07-30 23:45:12	@Espyo	meanwhile, I have to delete the files I uploaded in order to do the final import, right?
2014-07-30 23:45:17	@J	actually, file talk dumps may be missing altogether
2014-07-30 23:45:37	@Espyo	this would've been better if the bot was more general to begin with
2014-07-30 23:45:43	@Espyo	like, not so much patched together for the current task
2014-07-30 23:45:44	@J	no, if they succeeded, you just delete import-...-<dumpnumber>
2014-07-30 23:46:01	@J	it's a complicated task, though
2014-07-30 23:46:05	@Espyo	at least then I could always take care of doing the imports just using built-in menus and whatever
2014-07-30 23:46:10	@Espyo	instead of running around trying code and patches
2014-07-30 23:46:14	@Espyo	of course it's complicated...
2014-07-30 23:46:15	@J	each process does many things
2014-07-30 23:46:19	@Espyo	ideally, you'd take care of all of this
2014-07-30 23:46:24	@Espyo	but the rotten timing...
2014-07-30 23:46:27	@J	yeah
2014-07-30 23:46:36	@J	also, no-one likes menus
2014-07-30 23:46:45	@Espyo	well, that's true, but there's no other option
2014-07-30 23:46:48	@Espyo	unless I type it all out
2014-07-30 23:46:50	@J	yep
2014-07-30 23:46:51	@Espyo	but that takes ages
2014-07-30 23:46:53	@J	typing is fun
2014-07-30 23:46:57	@Espyo	sure
2014-07-30 23:46:59	@Espyo	but it takes longer
2014-07-30 23:47:01	@J	http://stuff.ikn.org.uk/fileshare/dumps.tar.xz
2014-07-30 23:47:05	@Espyo	well, maybe not longer
2014-07-30 23:47:11	@J	but it's scriptable
2014-07-30 23:47:13	@Espyo	reading the menu probably takes longer
2014-07-30 23:47:17	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 23:47:21	@J	so you can set it up so that a single letter does what you want
2014-07-30 23:47:29	@Espyo	... .5G?
2014-07-30 23:47:32	@Espyo	as in 500M?
2014-07-30 23:47:33	Testyo	500 m = 546.8 yd / 1640.4 ft / 26315.8 Olimar-heights
2014-07-30 23:47:35	@J	yeah
2014-07-30 23:47:39	@J	compressed to 7M
2014-07-30 23:47:39	Testyo	7 m = 7.6552 yd / 22.9656 ft / 368.421 Olimar-heights
2014-07-30 23:47:43	@Espyo	black magic
2014-07-30 23:47:56	@J	xz is quite impressive
2014-07-30 23:48:06	@Espyo	so, what do I do with these dumps?
2014-07-30 23:48:10	@Espyo	dump them on the bot folder?
2014-07-30 23:48:13	@J	yeah
2014-07-30 23:48:22	@J	they're the results of get and transform for most other namespaces
2014-07-30 23:48:28	@J	like I said, file talk isn't started
2014-07-30 23:48:34	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-30 23:48:42	@Espyo	I'll have to do the get and transform for file talk, then
2014-07-30 23:49:03	@Espyo	 247 files to replace...
2014-07-30 23:49:07	@Espyo	the dumps
2014-07-30 23:49:20	@J	hmm
2014-07-30 23:49:27	@J	I didn't think I sent any duplicates
2014-07-30 23:49:31	@J	examples?
2014-07-30 23:49:54	@J	yeah, try get and transform for file talk now, it shouldn't take long
2014-07-30 23:49:55	@Espyo	mergeimg
2014-07-30 23:49:57	@Espyo	 0, 1, etc.
2014-07-30 23:49:58	@J	and doesn't need any inputs
2014-07-30 23:50:05	@J	should turn of debug first
2014-07-30 23:50:10	@J	or the dumps will be weird
2014-07-30 23:50:35	@Espyo	ok, to change the mode to get/transform...
2014-07-30 23:50:37	@J	hmm, I thought I didn't give you export- for mergeimg
2014-07-30 23:50:48	@J	well, doesn't matter, they should be the same files
2014-07-30 23:51:00	@J	just type get or transform instead of merge
2014-07-30 23:51:08	@Espyo	you did give it
2014-07-30 23:51:14	@J	*instead of import
2014-07-30 23:51:20	@Espyo	ah, right
2014-07-30 23:51:25	@J	if you get it wrong, nothing will happen, very quickly
2014-07-30 23:51:27	@Espyo	get first, transform after?
2014-07-30 23:51:27	@J	uh
2014-07-30 23:51:31	@J	*fairly quickly-ish
2014-07-30 23:51:35	@J	yeah, get first
2014-07-30 23:51:46	@J	wrong order probably causes crashes
2014-07-30 23:51:54	@Espyo	asked for a password
2014-07-30 23:51:55	@Espyo	hmm
2014-07-30 23:52:03	@J	it always asks for a password, doesn't it?
2014-07-30 23:52:11	@J	oh, I see
2014-07-30 23:52:14	@Espyo	this is just a get, it... shouldn't, right?
2014-07-30 23:52:17	@Espyo	anyway, it completed
2014-07-30 23:52:20	@Espyo	no errors
2014-07-30 23:52:22	@J	yeah, I guess it could do the read-only part without logging in
2014-07-30 23:52:23	@J	but lazy
2014-07-30 23:52:34	@Espyo	*shrug*
2014-07-30 23:52:36	@Espyo	transform...
2014-07-30 23:52:53	@Espyo	taking a bit longer
2014-07-30 23:52:55	@J	if you get bored of typing the password, you can of course hardcode it
2014-07-30 23:53:00	@J	yeah, transform takes a while for talk
2014-07-30 23:53:15	@J	anyway, you can run imports at the same time
2014-07-30 23:53:23	@J	please test a talk import
2014-07-30 23:53:26	@Espyo	right
2014-07-30 23:53:54	@J	might want to turn debug on again
2014-07-30 23:53:58	@Espyo	yeah, about that
2014-07-30 23:54:02	@J	...assuming Windows lets you
2014-07-30 23:54:05	@Espyo	can I just edit merge.py while — yeah
2014-07-30 23:54:07	@Espyo	probably won't
2014-07-30 23:54:09	@Espyo	oh, doesn't matter
2014-07-30 23:54:11	@Espyo	it completed
2014-07-30 23:54:15	@J	oh, good
2014-07-30 23:54:17	@Espyo	wrote json data to bla
2014-07-30 23:54:21	@J	you could make a copy if you need to
2014-07-30 23:54:27	@Espyo	yeah
2014-07-30 23:54:28	@J	doesn't matter what it's called
2014-07-30 23:54:39	@Espyo	all right, debug on, testing file talk import
2014-07-30 23:55:17	@Espyo	hopefully it d-- dammit
2014-07-30 23:55:32	@Espyo	merge.py l780, titles not defined
2014-07-30 23:58:11	@J	yeah, so that's because I'm crazy
2014-07-30 23:58:24	@Espyo	well, yeah
2014-07-30 23:58:31	@Espyo	what line do I need to edit?
2014-07-30 23:58:34	@J	I hackily hacked a thing earlier to day
2014-07-30 23:58:36	@J	*today
2014-07-30 23:58:37	@Espyo	quickly now, it's almost august
2014-07-30 23:58:43	@J	wait a minute, I'll do it
2014-07-30 23:58:48	@Espyo	hm, ok
2014-07-30 23:59:01	@Espyo	ugh, so let me recollect my thoughts
2014-07-30 23:59:14	@Espyo	get and transform place things on my computer that are ready to be imported to pikipedia
2014-07-30 23:59:18	@Espyo	import imports them
2014-07-30 23:59:22	@Espyo	any problems are reported
2014-07-30 23:59:55	@J	yeah, import for talk is tricky to make happen in parts
2014-07-30 23:59:56	@Espyo	I keep the successful edits on Pikipedia and delete the file on the dumps
2014-07-31 00:00:12	@J	but it actually doesn't matter if it runs the same page twiced
2014-07-31 00:00:14	@J	*twice
2014-07-31 00:00:17	@Espyo	command line is '<python> "File talk" "File talk" import', to import file talks
2014-07-31 00:00:21	@Espyo	you got all of that, future Espyo?
2014-07-31 00:00:21	@Espyo	good
2014-07-31 00:00:30	@Espyo	hm, yeah, I guess not
2014-07-31 00:00:34	@Espyo	worse for uploads
2014-07-31 00:00:39	@Espyo	probably a lot worse for transform
2014-07-31 00:00:51	@J	http://sprunge.us/TJhi
2014-07-31 00:00:56	@J	untested, but should work
2014-07-31 00:01:22	@Espyo	there's no unicode in this is there
2014-07-31 00:01:22	@J	it's because the importjson file, generated by transform, contains the full text to edit with
2014-07-31 00:01:26	@Espyo	I just selected all and c+p
2014-07-31 00:01:35	@J	no
2014-07-31 00:01:47	@J	I added the utf-8 header because my password had non-ASCII
2014-07-31 00:01:52	@Espyo	all right, less crashness now
2014-07-31 00:01:57	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-31 00:02:01	@J	but it will run all of them 
2014-07-31 00:02:06	@J	just stop it if you want
2014-07-31 00:02:17	@Espyo	...N++ says the file is in ANSI
2014-07-31 00:02:19	@J	as in kill it once you see changes start appearing
2014-07-31 00:02:36	@Espyo	oh
2014-07-31 00:02:39	@Espyo	I killed before
2014-07-31 00:03:14	@Espyo	I can just restart, right
2014-07-31 00:03:31	@J	yeah
2014-07-31 00:03:45	@J	talk is fine to run multiple times

2014-07-31 00:06:08	@Espyo	wait, it took that long to do /one/?
2014-07-31 00:07:19	@Espyo	oh, it's over
2014-07-31 00:07:26	@Espyo	and it did one
2014-07-31 00:07:27	@Espyo	hm
2014-07-31 00:08:07	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=File_talk%3A6.jpg&diff=92764&oldid=64410 .............
2014-07-31 00:09:40	@J	yeah...
2014-07-31 00:09:52	@J	we noticed earlier that talk merging can go wrong
2014-07-31 00:10:05	@J	it's because it's a hard problem, and I did it hackily in a couple of days
2014-07-31 00:10:21	@Espyo	maybe we should do file talk after you come back
2014-07-31 00:10:24	@Espyo	...what about mainspace talk?
2014-07-31 00:10:35	@J	all talks are the same
2014-07-31 00:10:48	@Espyo	well, dammit
2014-07-31 00:10:49	@J	but there really shouldn't be many pages like that
2014-07-31 00:10:50	@Espyo	it'll have to wait
2014-07-31 00:10:58	@J	user talk is worse
2014-07-31 00:11:12	@J	and I don't think we'll easily get a better solution anyway
2014-07-31 00:11:19	@Espyo	yeah, but the thing is
2014-07-31 00:11:21	@Espyo	stuff is breaking
2014-07-31 00:11:23	@Espyo	you can fix it
2014-07-31 00:11:26	@Espyo	and you're running out of time
2014-07-31 00:11:28	@Espyo	so... it'll have to wait
2014-07-31 00:11:34	@J	I can't really fix it
2014-07-31 00:11:43	@J	when I said it's a hard problem, I mean it's a _hard_ problem
2014-07-31 00:11:51	@J	hard like OCR
2014-07-31 00:11:55	@Espyo	...
2014-07-31 00:11:59	@Espyo	well, what am I to do?
2014-07-31 00:12:10	@Espyo	keep going? power through and try to manually fix these errors?
2014-07-31 00:12:14	@J	how many are going wrong?
2014-07-31 00:12:16	@Espyo	or are all going to do this?
2014-07-31 00:12:22	@Espyo	...1 out of 1 out of 1
2014-07-31 00:12:28	@J	that's odd
2014-07-31 00:12:36	@Espyo	I told it to do 10 for the test, it did 1
2014-07-31 00:12:40	@Espyo	and that 1 was the link I gave you
2014-07-31 00:12:44	@Espyo	so yeah, stuff is really broken
2014-07-31 00:13:01	@J	you've only done one talk edit
2014-07-31 00:13:02	@J	oh
2014-07-31 00:13:14	@J	how did you tell it to do 10
2014-07-31 00:13:30	@Espyo	"DEBUG_PAGE_LIM = 10"?
2014-07-31 00:13:49	@J	heh
2014-07-31 00:13:52	@J	heheh
2014-07-31 00:13:53	@Espyo	...let me guess
2014-07-31 00:13:59	@Espyo	DEBUG_IMPORT_ONE = True
2014-07-31 00:14:12	@J	you may have done bad things
2014-07-31 00:14:16	@Espyo	:|
2014-07-31 00:14:38	@J	if you had that set for get and transform (debug = true, pagelim = 10), it makes sense, almost
2014-07-31 00:14:49	@Espyo	I had it off
2014-07-31 00:14:54	@J	it won't bother making edits when it doesn't need to
2014-07-31 00:14:57	@J	which is fairly often
2014-07-31 00:15:03	@J	huh
2014-07-31 00:15:07	@Espyo	hmm, yeah, there's only one file talk import json
2014-07-31 00:15:16	@J	you only get one for importjson
2014-07-31 00:15:22	@Espyo	hmm, all right
2014-07-31 00:15:25	@Espyo	but what about the xml
2014-07-31 00:15:33	@Espyo	because I have none of those
2014-07-31 00:15:54	@Espyo	somehow I have 22 for mainspace and 246 for file
2014-07-31 00:15:57	@J	there's no XML for talk
2014-07-31 00:16:11	@Espyo	then where are the edits supposedly coming from?
2014-07-31 00:16:15	@J	importjson
2014-07-31 00:16:27	@Espyo	this tiny thing?
2014-07-31 00:16:31	@J	look in there, you should see lots of page contents
2014-07-31 00:16:33	@Espyo	how can this hold all of File talk
2014-07-31 00:16:38	@J	hmm, it's sounding bad
2014-07-31 00:16:38	@Espyo	it's only 1M
2014-07-31 00:16:39	Testyo	1 m = 1.0936 yd / 3.2808 ft / 52.6316 Olimar-heights
2014-07-31 00:16:42	@J	1M is plenty
2014-07-31 00:16:43	Testyo	1 m = 1.0936 yd / 3.2808 ft / 52.6316 Olimar-heights
2014-07-31 00:16:46	@Espyo	plenty nothingness
2014-07-31 00:16:53	@J	main is about 5M
2014-07-31 00:16:53	Testyo	5 m = 5.468 yd / 16.404 ft / 263.158 Olimar-heights
2014-07-31 00:16:58	@Espyo	hmmm
2014-07-31 00:17:04	@Espyo	all right, but even still, it only doing one...
2014-07-31 00:17:17	@J	send me your importjson?
2014-07-31 00:17:31	@Espyo	wait wait wait
2014-07-31 00:17:34	@Espyo	it's 57K
2014-07-31 00:17:34	Testyo	57 K = -216.15 °C / -357.07 °F
2014-07-31 00:17:41	@Espyo	file talk, 57
2014-07-31 00:17:41	@Espyo	yep
2014-07-31 00:17:57	@Espyo	broken json
2014-07-31 00:18:00	@J	I do have to go, but I'm far too curious for my own good
2014-07-31 00:18:02	@Espyo	there's no closing }
2014-07-31 00:18:08	@Espyo	like I said, forget the talk
2014-07-31 00:18:10	@J	if it's broken, it would crash
2014-07-31 00:18:14	@J	so it's not
2014-07-31 00:18:15	@Espyo	as long as file and namespace is working
2014-07-31 00:18:28	@Espyo	weird, N++ isn't highlighting the closing }
2014-07-31 00:18:30	@J	fair enough
2014-07-31 00:18:35	@Espyo	and highlights the closing one as unopened
2014-07-31 00:18:42	@J	we can do talk later if you really think it's not working
2014-07-31 00:18:52	@J	but I will blame you
2014-07-31 00:18:52	@Espyo	there's not even quite a place to grab it from
2014-07-31 00:18:59	@J	main shouldn't be much of a problem
2014-07-31 00:18:59	@Espyo	and even when it's working, you still said it's HARD hard so
2014-07-31 00:19:02	@Espyo	this needs a lot of attention
2014-07-31 00:19:04	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-31 00:19:11	@Espyo	from here on out, I can at least focus on getting it to work
2014-07-31 00:19:15	@J	...still want to see that file

2014-07-31 00:20:38	@Espyo	(how long is your vacation?)
2014-07-31 00:20:43	@Espyo	(2 weeks, was it?)
2014-07-31 00:20:55	@J	2 weeks-ish
2014-07-31 00:21:11	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-31 00:21:45	@Espyo	well, that's all from me
2014-07-31 00:21:48	@Espyo	you should probably go, then
2014-07-31 00:22:04	@J	that json file is valid and has 94 pages in it
2014-07-31 00:22:06	@Espyo	even if something goes wrong, I can at least take the time to examine the source
2014-07-31 00:22:11	@Espyo	how even
2014-07-31 00:22:15	@J	not sure why the edits didn't happen; I blame your debug options
2014-07-31 00:22:38	@Espyo	there's no way that puny little file has 94 pages worth of file talk
2014-07-31 00:22:42	@Espyo	but I'll see tomorrow
2014-07-31 00:22:47	@J	the file is pretty easy to understand, so look through it if you want, and try import without debug if you can
2014-07-31 00:22:49	@J	yeah
2014-07-31 00:22:49	@J	okay
2014-07-31 00:23:00	@J	I maybe be around tomorrow, probably not
2014-07-31 00:23:10	@Espyo	I wake up at 11
2014-07-31 00:23:10	@J	and possibly at some point in the next two weeks
2014-07-31 00:23:15	@Espyo	all right
2014-07-31 00:23:16	@J	in the evening
2014-07-31 00:23:26	@J	but anyway, goodnight
2014-07-31 00:23:39	@Espyo	night
2014-07-31 00:23:44	@Espyo	and have fun
2014-07-31 00:23:57	@Espyo	dunno how vacations are over there, but I'm guessing you only get 14 days a year to relax

2014-07-31 11:09:13	@PikFan	alright, so I wanted to edit [[Dismiss]] earlier, and add P3 stuff
2014-07-31 11:09:13	Testyo	"Dismiss" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Dismiss
2014-07-31 11:09:40	@PikFan	then realized that {{button}} doesn't have an icon for shaking the nunchuk
2014-07-31 11:09:40	Testyo	"button" template = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Template:button
2014-07-31 11:09:48	@PikFan	(that's how you dismiss in P3)
2014-07-31 11:10:35	@PikFan	so I tried messing around with it, and couldn't come up with anything suitable
2014-07-31 11:12:14	@Espyo	oh, yeah
2014-07-31 11:12:21	@Espyo	hmm, I'll work something out real quick
2014-07-31 11:17:39	@PikFan	appreciated
2014-07-31 11:18:09	@PikFan	oh, and also, was J trying to teach you how to run bots?
2014-07-31 11:21:11	@Espyo	just the bot
2014-07-31 11:21:15	@Espyo	yeah, he's on vacation now
2014-07-31 11:21:22	@Espyo	I'll be doing the imports
2014-07-31 11:21:32	@PikFan	I hope nothing goes wrong
2014-07-31 11:21:37	@Espyo	same here
2014-07-31 11:21:39	@Espyo	but we'll have to see
2014-07-31 11:21:48	@PikFan	like that hiccup yesterday with the user talk prefix missing
2014-07-31 11:21:49	@PikFan	heh

2014-07-31 20:16:59	@Espyo	bad news: the bot doesn't work in regular mode
2014-07-31 20:17:06	@PikFan	hmm
2014-07-31 20:17:10	@Espyo	so I can't just let it sit down and do all the hard work
2014-07-31 20:17:13	@Espyo	good news: it works in debug mode
2014-07-31 20:17:20	@PikFan	that's good
2014-07-31 20:17:23	@Espyo	debug mode is where me and GP tested, with only batches of 10 (?) at a time
2014-07-31 20:17:27	@Espyo	so... I have to keep switching batches
2014-07-31 20:17:38	@PikFan	I was going to say if you could hack it
2014-07-31 20:17:40	@Espyo	it's not hard, but I have to go back to execute it again like every 20 seconds
2014-07-31 20:17:47	@PikFan	which... isn't the best idea...

2014-07-31 20:23:55	@PikFan	we're going to have to go through them
2014-07-31 20:24:03	@Espyo	I think they have like 3 times as many new files as they have new pages
2014-07-31 20:24:16	@PikFan	wow
2014-07-31 20:24:20	@Espyo	I'll have to take care of P1 and P2 things
2014-07-31 20:24:23	@Espyo	you'll handle P3 things
2014-07-31 20:24:27	@PikFan	yeah
2014-07-31 20:24:50	@PikFan	will need admin powers to delete
2014-07-31 20:24:53	@PikFan	but J's not around
2014-07-31 20:25:25	@PikFan	hmm, question
2014-07-31 20:25:40	@PikFan	why is it that the bot imports some files, then uploads different files?
2014-07-31 20:26:21	@Espyo	like what?
2014-07-31 20:26:50	@PikFan	ok, so look at the recent changes
2014-07-31 20:26:56	@Espyo	yeah?
2014-07-31 20:27:05	@PikFan	it says it uploaded some files
2014-07-31 20:27:13	@PikFan	then under that, it says it imported files
2014-07-31 20:27:48	@PikFan	like this (hope it's not broken) http://mibpaste.com/R0x6tY 
2014-07-31 20:27:50	@Espyo	you're imagining things
2014-07-31 20:27:59	@Espyo	of course it's broken
2014-07-31 20:28:06	@PikFan	ugh
2014-07-31 20:28:12	@Espyo	oh, I see it now
2014-07-31 20:28:42	@Espyo	oh, it's because import is importing the history and such
2014-07-31 20:28:47	@Espyo	uploading is actually placing the file
2014-07-31 20:28:54	@PikFan	http://mibpaste.com/ZwFKrS 
2014-07-31 20:30:05	@PikFan	the files are different in import and upload
2014-07-31 20:30:24	@PikFan	is it doing it at [[random]]?
2014-07-31 20:30:24	Testyo	"random" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=random
2014-07-31 20:30:37	@Espyo	uh?
2014-07-31 20:30:45	@PikFan	(oops, forgot it was [[randomness]])
2014-07-31 20:30:45	Testyo	"randomness" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=randomness
2014-07-31 20:30:54	@PikFan	(I was trying to make a joke)
2014-07-31 20:31:37	@PikFan	but really, is it like importing some, then uploading others that it already imported?
2014-07-31 20:33:25	@Espyo	not really
2014-07-31 20:33:34	@Espyo	it does the three things for every one in the batch
2014-07-31 20:33:40	@Espyo	but the order of the thing for each is kinda random
2014-07-31 20:33:59	@PikFan	that kinda answers my question
2014-07-31 20:34:18	@PikFan	and the three things, I'm assuming, are import, upload, and edit?
2014-07-31 20:35:29	@Espyo	yep

2014-08-01 11:14:52	@PikFan	not sure if it changes anything, but I thought I'd point it out just in case
2014-08-01 11:17:10	@Espyo	hmmmmmmmmmm
2014-08-01 11:17:12	@Espyo	well, it does
2014-08-01 11:17:36	@PikFan	how?
2014-08-01 11:17:48	@Espyo	it's not nothing anymore, it's "save data"
2014-08-01 11:17:56	@Espyo	well, won't change the name of the article
2014-08-01 11:18:04	@Espyo	but at least it changes the section that handles the naming
2014-08-01 11:18:28	@PikFan	that's what I thought it'd change
2014-08-01 11:20:33	@PikFan	alright, what is this
2014-08-01 11:20:46	@PikFan	two EF+Rs and F+CFs
2014-08-01 11:20:50	@PikFan	all within two hours
2014-08-01 11:20:56	@Espyo	wow
2014-08-01 11:21:20	@PikFan	and there were two extra EFs, but no R
2014-08-01 11:21:26	@PikFan	so 4 EFs total
2014-08-01 11:21:37	@PikFan	if I pop wrinklers now I'll get around 20 sex
2014-08-01 11:21:57	@PikFan	make that 21

2014-08-01 11:22:25	@PikFan	11 prisms away
2014-08-01 11:22:33	@PikFan	getting spendy

2014-08-01 11:22:43	@PikFan	190th costs 21.57 sex
2014-08-01 11:22:50	@Espyo	speaking of popping wrinklers, I think I'll pop mine todau
2014-08-01 11:22:51	@Espyo	*today
2014-08-01 11:23:01	@Espyo	I'm close to buying the 200th time machine
2014-08-01 11:23:04	@Espyo	and I'll pop then
2014-08-01 11:23:08	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-01 11:23:12	@PikFan	where are you at?
2014-08-01 11:25:54	@Espyo	 139.12 quint

2014-08-01 11:26:16	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-01 11:27:02	@PikFan	ugh
2014-08-01 11:27:07	@PikFan	I misread that
2014-08-01 11:27:27	@PikFan	when you said you were close I thought you mean you had a few more TMs to go
2014-08-01 11:27:35	@PikFan	._.
2014-08-01 11:28:03	@Espyo	TMs?
2014-08-01 11:28:09	@PikFan	time machines
2014-08-01 11:28:32	@Espyo	oh, heh
2014-08-01 11:28:42	@PikFan	*meant
2014-08-01 11:28:45	@PikFan	...
2014-08-01 11:28:50	@PikFan	my brain is tired
2014-08-01 11:28:55	@PikFan	I need to sleep soon
2014-08-01 11:28:59	@Espyo	yeah...
2014-08-01 11:30:13	@PikFan	also, I realized that if I'm going for 200 prisms + bicentennial, then I may as well go for transcendence
2014-08-01 11:30:29	@PikFan	transcendence is bake 1 septillion cookies in a game
2014-08-01 11:30:45	@PikFan	I'll have 700 sex baked when I get 200 prism
2014-08-01 11:30:48	@PikFan	*prisms
2014-08-01 11:30:59	@PikFan	and my cps will be much greater
2014-08-01 11:31:04	@Espyo	hmm, yeah
2014-08-01 11:31:44	@PikFan	I'm crazy to do this under a million HCs
2014-08-01 11:32:21	@PikFan	I think most players go for it when they have like 1.2, 1.3 million HCs
2014-08-01 11:32:32	@PikFan	but I have 800k
2014-08-01 11:32:32	Testyo	800 K = 526.85 °C / 980.33 °F
2014-08-01 11:33:31	@PikFan	also scared myself earlier today
2014-08-01 11:33:42	@PikFan	rediscovered Dr. T
2014-08-01 11:38:01	@Espyo	Dr. T...
2014-08-01 11:38:08	@PikFan	oh, and there was a thunderstorm earlier
2014-08-01 11:38:31	@PikFan	lots of lightning, but distant: little thunder
2014-08-01 11:38:58	@Espyo	hm, stupid weather
2014-08-01 11:39:04	@PikFan	indeed
2014-08-01 11:39:30	@PikFan	oh, another thing
2014-08-01 11:39:40	@PikFan	so I was going through the files imported
2014-08-01 11:39:53	@PikFan	and came upon the enemy pictures from P3
2014-08-01 11:41:09	@PikFan	all they are are models
2014-08-01 11:41:35	@PikFan	like this http://www.pikminwiki.com/images/1/1a/Medusal_slurker.png
2014-08-01 11:41:51	@PikFan	we could make enemy icons with them
2014-08-01 11:42:03	@PikFan	...I need to learn how to do more advanced stuff
2014-08-01 11:43:54	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-01 11:44:00	@Espyo	hm, and these screenshots are cropped
2014-08-01 11:44:05	@Espyo	I'll have to ask the uploader how they got it
2014-08-01 11:44:13	@PikFan	it was ymmot
2014-08-01 11:44:32	@Espyo	thought so
2014-08-01 11:44:38	@PikFan	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Ymmot392&offset=&limit=500&target=Ymmot392
2014-08-01 11:44:43	@PikFan	heh, why?
2014-08-01 11:44:47	@Espyo	he must've used the same cropping method me and GP used on Gimp
2014-08-01 11:44:58	@Espyo	just want to know if he has the skill for it, or if he got them online
2014-08-01 11:45:21	@PikFan	mm
2014-08-01 11:46:10	@Espyo	Zelda Wiki does that a lot
2014-08-01 11:46:17	@Espyo	show images that are cropped like that
2014-08-01 11:46:20	@Espyo	I was thinking we could do the same
2014-08-01 11:46:37	@Espyo	but it's kinda complicated, because we might need the originals and such
2014-08-01 11:46:37	@PikFan	how can you tell it's cropped?
2014-08-01 11:47:25	@Espyo	transparent background
2014-08-01 11:47:36	@PikFan	okay
2014-08-01 11:49:25	@PikFan	"The following 200 files are in this category, out of 3,581 total."
2014-08-01 11:49:32	@PikFan	3,581?!
2014-08-01 11:50:00	@Espyo	:|
2014-08-01 11:50:03	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-01 11:50:11	@Espyo	DEFINITELY a lot more new files than new pages
2014-08-01 11:50:32	@PikFan	...how many files did we have before we imported
2014-08-01 11:51:03	@Espyo	less than 3581, I can tell you that much
2014-08-01 11:51:11	@PikFan	heh
2014-08-01 11:51:20	@PikFan	image-happy much
2014-08-01 11:51:43	@Espyo	brb
2014-08-01 11:55:04	@Espyo	 2996
2014-08-01 11:55:09	@Espyo	is how many images we had before this import
2014-08-01 11:55:14	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/Special:Statistics
2014-08-01 11:55:19	@PikFan	did you—yeah
2014-08-01 12:13:30	@PikFan	I'm cringing at these logs
2014-08-01 12:13:33	@PikFan	but laughing
2014-08-01 12:13:58	@PikFan	I used to be so serious back in the day...
2014-08-01 12:14:12	@Espyo	hehehe
2014-08-01 12:14:18	@PikFan	I still am, I suppose
2014-08-01 12:15:09	@PikFan	what I was trying to do is find the reason why J insisted that, in the ship's dialogs, red text be bolded
2014-08-01 12:15:23	@PikFan	*red text be bolded instead
2014-08-01 12:16:26	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-01 12:17:05	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure he explained it on IRC
2014-08-01 12:17:08	@PikFan	could be wrong
2014-08-01 12:17:28	@Espyo	can't really remember
2014-08-01 12:19:12	@PikFan	21:01:57: <j> I assume this 'CRAP' thing is an acronym...
2014-08-01 12:19:15	@PikFan	...?
2014-08-01 12:19:42	@Espyo	lolwut
2014-08-01 12:20:41	@PikFan	can't find anything
2014-08-01 12:20:56	@PikFan	besides, that was years ago
2014-08-01 12:20:58	@Espyo	I don't think I even had logs enabled back then
2014-08-01 12:21:11	@Espyo	isn't it on a talk page?
2014-08-01 12:21:16	@PikFan	possibly
2014-08-01 12:21:23	@PikFan	actually
2014-08-01 12:21:28	@PikFan	that sounds familiar
2014-08-01 12:21:38	@PikFan	but it might be my mind playing tricks on me
2014-08-01 12:22:20	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-01 12:22:52	@PikFan	nope, nothing
2014-08-01 12:23:10	@PikFan	gaaah
2014-08-01 12:23:21	@PikFan	I KNOW he said something about bolding it
2014-08-01 12:23:27	@PikFan	but I can't find it...
2014-08-01 12:23:32	@PikFan	let's see...
2014-08-01 12:23:36	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-01 12:23:49	@PikFan	I made my mibbit account in early 2012, because I wanted logs
2014-08-01 12:24:13	@PikFan	around the same time we started the project
2014-08-01 12:24:21	@PikFan	...maybe it was before
2014-08-01 12:24:42	@PikFan	hmm, but no, because the logs said that I had started
2014-08-01 12:24:49	@PikFan	which means I started after I joined
2014-08-01 12:24:55	@PikFan	...was I not logged in?
2014-08-01 12:25:44	@Espyo	you had to be
2014-08-01 12:29:38	@PikFan	amazing
2014-08-01 12:29:41	@PikFan	can't find any
2014-08-01 12:30:12	@PikFan	you try looking
2014-08-01 12:30:37	@PikFan	I'm pretty sure that you had a mibbit account longer than me
2014-08-01 12:31:35	@Espyo	but I only enabled logging later
2014-08-01 12:31:49	@PikFan	:\
2014-08-01 12:31:52	@PikFan	when?
2014-08-01 12:32:11	@Espyo	I don't know
2014-08-01 12:32:14	@Espyo	I can't remember
2014-08-01 12:32:20	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-01 12:32:28	@PikFan	one option left
2014-08-01 12:32:45	@PikFan	we'll have to <s>interrogate</s> ask J when he gets back
2014-08-01 12:34:27	@PikFan	ooh, maybe it was in an edit summary
2014-08-01 12:38:08	@PikFan	nothing
2014-08-01 12:38:18	@PikFan	oh well, I'm tired anyway

2014-08-09 23:06:23	@PikFan	aeroblaze decided to change it to ACL, because it's "Name in Pikmin 3, which is most up 2 date"
2014-08-09 23:06:31	@PikFan	and yes, that is true
2014-08-09 23:06:34	@PikFan	but it breaks stuff

2014-08-09 23:10:24	@Espyo	yep
2014-08-09 23:10:37	@Espyo	plus, updating to the most recent name isn't really the way we want to go
2014-08-09 23:10:42	@Espyo	like Wollyhop
2014-08-09 23:10:47	@Espyo	or Wollywop or whatever they're called now
2014-08-09 23:10:49	@Espyo	nobody wants to call them that
2014-08-09 23:10:55	@Espyo	but do we go by the popular name, or the recent name?
2014-08-09 23:11:02	@Espyo	on the Carmageddon wiki, I had the same questions sometimes
2014-08-09 23:11:36	@PikFan	"Also, ACBL is more popular than ACL"
2014-08-09 23:14:21	@Espyo	no, don't go there
2014-08-09 23:14:24	@Espyo	because that's kind of debatable
2014-08-09 23:14:35	@Espyo	that Wollywog is more popular than Wollywop, most people agree
2014-08-09 23:14:40	@Espyo	but ACBL vs ACL... who knows
2014-08-09 23:14:49	@PikFan	...crud
2014-08-09 23:14:54	@PikFan	too late
2014-08-09 23:15:22	@PikFan	well, hopefully they'll agree that it is more popular

2014-08-10 22:06:36	@Espyo	hi
2014-08-10 22:07:49	@PikFan	couple days ago I found this thread about the CC update: http://www.reddit.com/r/CookieClicker/comments/2czreb/orteil_4chan_posts/
2014-08-10 22:08:04	@PikFan	apparently Orteil likes to talk on 4chan, ugh
2014-08-10 22:08:26	@PikFan	at least they're screenshotting his posts
2014-08-10 22:09:31	@PikFan	so aside from the prestige revamp and new buildings, it looks like there's going to be cross building upgrades
2014-08-10 22:10:09	@PikFan	as well as individualized minigames for some buildings
2014-08-10 22:10:49	@PikFan	mostly dungeons
2014-08-10 22:11:05	@PikFan	also this is hilarious http://i.imgur.com/hB7eB5j.png
2014-08-10 22:14:10	@Espyo	nice
2014-08-10 22:14:54	@PikFan	I wonder if he's going to release a new tier of upgrades and achievements for the buildings, too
2014-08-10 22:15:01	@Espyo	and for some reason that pic took 30 times longer to load than the rest
2014-08-10 22:15:04	@Espyo	he has to
2014-08-10 22:15:27	@PikFan	that'll be what... tier 6?
2014-08-10 22:15:51	@PikFan	tier 6 for achievements, tier 7 for upgrades
2014-08-10 22:16:02	@PikFan	250 prisms... *shudders*
2014-08-10 22:21:22	@PikFan	also I've been hearing rumors of wiping your save in order to experience the new prestige system
2014-08-10 22:21:48	@PikFan	and I definitely am not wiping my save, thank you very much
2014-08-10 22:22:28	@PikFan	oh, and the cookie upgrades will become much more powerful: they act like eggs
2014-08-10 22:22:39	@PikFan	i.e. they add to the global multiplier
2014-08-10 22:23:05	@PikFan	so the cps should skyrocket
2014-08-10 22:24:22	@PikFan	all in all, it seems that big changes are headed our way
2014-08-10 22:24:50	@Espyo	finally
2014-08-10 22:25:24	@Espyo	I'm sick and tired of buying 900 quad cookies that don't change my cps
2014-08-10 22:44:08	@PikFan	alright, so the change is monumental: cps will increase 9,684.78 times
2014-08-10 22:46:56	@PikFan	...I thinl
2014-08-10 22:46:58	@PikFan	*think
2014-08-10 22:47:10	@PikFan	might've forgotten santa's dominion
2014-08-10 22:47:52	@PikFan	if I did forget santa's dominion, then it's 14,527.17 times
2014-08-10 23:11:08	@Espyo	damn cultural differences
2014-08-10 23:11:13	@Espyo	it's so hard to read the numbers you wrote
2014-08-10 23:11:22	@Espyo	why not use ' as a thousands separator?
2014-08-10 23:11:28	@Espyo	but no, let's have every country do it their own way
2014-08-10 23:11:32	@Espyo	and all ways are hard to read
2014-08-10 23:11:42	@Espyo	comma vs dot doesn't bother me much for the decimal places
2014-08-10 23:12:00	@Espyo	because in Portugal, it's a comma, but in programming it's a dot, so I'm accustomed to both
2014-08-10 23:12:00	@PikFan	...14527.17?
2014-08-10 23:12:07	@Espyo	that's even harder to read
2014-08-10 23:12:13	@PikFan	:|
2014-08-10 23:12:14	@Espyo	but 14'527.17 is pretty easy
2014-08-10 23:12:31	@Espyo	but yeah, that's... pretty overkill
2014-08-10 23:12:37	@Espyo	hurry up, Orteil!
2014-08-10 23:13:07	@PikFan	I read somewhere that it isn't a CC update without it being fashionably late
2014-08-10 23:14:01	@Espyo	lol
2014-08-10 23:14:05	@Espyo	guess that is true
2014-08-10 23:27:23	@PikFan	why why why why why why why why why why why WHY does Orteil have to post in 4chan >_>
2014-08-10 23:27:31	@PikFan	anywhere but 4chan
2014-08-10 23:27:49	@PikFan	ridiculously hard to find his posts

2014-08-13 21:18:57	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-13 21:19:13	@PikFan	so he's announced it
2014-08-13 21:19:19	@PikFan	but it's been kept secret
2014-08-13 21:19:37	@PikFan	I hope wikia doesn't become concerned
2014-08-13 21:20:16	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-13 21:20:18	@PikFan	when does J return?
2014-08-13 21:23:23	@Espyo	no idea
2014-08-13 21:23:25	@Espyo	he said 2 weeks
2014-08-13 21:23:28	@Espyo	so hopefully this weekend
2014-08-13 21:23:32	@Espyo	...which means I have an idea
2014-08-13 21:23:33	@Espyo	well, damn
2014-08-13 21:23:45	@PikFan	?
2014-08-13 21:23:58	@Espyo	I started by saying I have no idea
2014-08-13 21:24:07	@Espyo	and then I give a pretty good estimate of when he's coming back
2014-08-13 21:24:11	@Espyo	meaning I DO have an idea
2014-08-13 21:25:24	@PikFan	heh

2014-08-13 21:31:34	@PikFan	new update in the works for Cookie Clicker
2014-08-13 21:31:40	@PikFan	STILL, might I add
2014-08-13 21:31:55	Meisterbot	yaaaasssss
2014-08-13 21:33:48	Meisterbot	i finally figured out mario 64 hacking :D
2014-08-13 21:44:13	@J	.
2014-08-13 21:44:26	@PikFan	ohey
2014-08-13 21:44:29	@PikFan	you're back
2014-08-13 21:44:32	@J	I'm still technically away
2014-08-13 21:44:37	@J	but I'll be around a bit
2014-08-13 21:44:42	@PikFan	yay
2014-08-13 21:44:45	@J	I return properly on Monday
2014-08-13 21:44:51	@PikFan	so when can—ah
2014-08-13 21:45:13	@PikFan	how's holiday?
2014-08-13 21:45:41	@J	it's good, mostly just a good opportunity to see a lot of my family
2014-08-13 21:45:49	@PikFan	I see
2014-08-13 21:46:15	@J	how did the migration go?
2014-08-13 21:46:28	@PikFan	he imported all the files
2014-08-13 21:46:34	@PikFan	now it's down to the articles
2014-08-13 21:46:49	@PikFan	Espyo couldn't import the articles
2014-08-13 21:47:21	@J	oh dear
2014-08-13 21:47:25	@J	any idea why?
2014-08-13 21:47:35	@PikFan	*shrug*
2014-08-13 21:47:39	@J	okay
2014-08-13 21:47:50	@PikFan	there's also this: http://pikmin.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Jpmrocks7/Wiki_Changes!
2014-08-13 21:48:10	@J	well, I could technically do it from here, since I got wake-on-lan working and I'm logged into my desktop at home through the Raspberry Pi
2014-08-13 21:48:40	@PikFan	hmm...
2014-08-13 21:49:11	@PikFan	though there's a chance of something going awry
2014-08-13 21:49:21	@J	yep
2014-08-13 21:50:00	@PikFan	huh?
2014-08-13 21:50:07	@J	'This is a big secret to everybody that everbody must know.'
2014-08-13 21:50:25	@J	'yep' was at the possibility of something going wrong
2014-08-13 21:50:38	@PikFan	what about rescuing Yazidi refugees?
2014-08-13 21:51:00	@PikFan	no, "huh?" was at what I just said
2014-08-13 21:51:20	@J	now I'm confused
2014-08-13 21:51:35	Meisterbot	wait
2014-08-13 21:51:40	@J	that was a global network message sent to everyone
2014-08-13 21:51:46	Meisterbot	<@PikFan> what about rescuing Yazidi refugees?
2014-08-13 21:51:48	Meisterbot	oh
2014-08-13 21:51:49	@PikFan	yeah, that
2014-08-13 21:52:35	Meisterbot	i dont even know what they r talking about
2014-08-13 21:58:46	@Espyo	here I am
2014-08-13 21:58:59	@Espyo	yeah, leave it for Monday
2014-08-13 21:59:04	@Espyo	people waited this long, they can wait further
2014-08-13 21:59:08	Meisterbot	ohi Espyo
2014-08-13 21:59:12	@Espyo	the edit token — the wiki claims the bot's not sending it
2014-08-13 21:59:21	@Espyo	but I read the source code... and everything seems fine
2014-08-13 21:59:26	@Espyo	it DID work once, on a test run
2014-08-13 21:59:33	@J	ooh, yeah, I had that for a while
2014-08-13 21:59:37	@J	forget how I fixed it
2014-08-13 21:59:48	@Espyo	hey Meisterbot
2014-08-13 21:59:53	Meisterbot	hi
2014-08-13 21:59:56	@Espyo	well, that's lovely then :|
2014-08-13 22:00:09	@Espyo	uh...
2014-08-13 22:00:14	@Espyo	oh, also
2014-08-13 22:00:18	@Espyo	I can't really remember, but
2014-08-13 22:00:30	@Espyo	I think the page import didn't even run on debug mode, but ran in normal mode
2014-08-13 22:00:35	@Espyo	and the thing I did before that was the exact opposite
2014-08-13 22:00:48	@Espyo	though the mainspace import not working in debug could as well be because of the ticket
2014-08-13 22:01:14	@J	if you import the same edits, twice, the second one doesn't show up in any RC
2014-08-13 22:02:22	@Espyo	yeah, because it's an import
2014-08-13 22:02:33	@Espyo	uh...
2014-08-13 22:02:43	@Espyo	Testyo tried fetching the RC from Fanon and Pikipedia, but failed
2014-08-13 22:02:46	@Espyo	Testyo: update wiki
2014-08-13 22:02:47	Testyo	Fetching the recent changes from the wikis...
2014-08-13 22:02:57	@Espyo	fetched them fine, now
2014-08-13 22:06:04	@J	was the error in the output or a file?
2014-08-13 22:06:22	@J	the edit token error
2014-08-13 22:06:28	@Espyo	output
2014-08-13 22:07:32	@J	it was the actual import that failed, then (not the edits afterwards)

2014-08-13 22:07:53	@J	now, there is a weird thing here
2014-08-13 22:08:12	@J	the API documentation is unclear about how import tokens work
2014-08-13 22:08:20	@J	when you request a token, you have to give page titles
2014-08-13 22:08:32	@J	but import acts on many pages
2014-08-13 22:08:49	@Espyo	well, the wiki says it's not even receiving one
2014-08-13 22:08:55	@J	and requesting tokens for many pages doesn't really work (I forget why)
2014-08-13 22:09:00	@Espyo	by debugging, I can check that the bot really is getting a token
2014-08-13 22:09:05	@J	so I just request a taken for the page 'anypage'
2014-08-13 22:09:07	@Espyo	and from what I can see, it's also /sending/...
2014-08-13 22:09:12	@J	and that seemed to work for me
2014-08-13 22:09:15	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-13 22:10:19	@Espyo	http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Group_move&curid=9944&diff=109265&oldid=82135 hmm, what do you guys think?
2014-08-13 22:10:24	@Espyo	also yeah, we better wait for Monday
2014-08-13 22:11:14	@J	I wouldn't be able to tell the difference
2014-08-13 22:11:53	@J	I didn't think they sounded wooden, though
2014-08-13 22:11:57	@Espyo	same here
2014-08-13 22:12:02	@Espyo	a bassoon isn't wooden, is it?
2014-08-13 22:12:05	@Espyo	it's like a... tuba
2014-08-13 22:12:33	@J	I thought it was like a large oboe

2014-08-13 22:13:59	@Espyo	dunno, whatever HexChat's pinging
2014-08-13 22:14:07	@Espyo	it does this automatically every few seconds
2014-08-13 22:14:07	@J	arkmyst?
2014-08-13 22:14:10	@Espyo	probably
2014-08-13 22:14:11	@J	*darkmyst
2014-08-13 22:14:21	@J	ping chanserv
2014-08-13 22:14:42	@J	...that was
2014-08-13 22:14:50	@J	just ignore that, I'm very silly
2014-08-13 22:14:59	@Espyo	well, got no reply
2014-08-13 22:15:01	@PikFan	oh
2014-08-13 22:15:04	@Espyo	 /guessing/ that's normal
2014-08-13 22:15:07	@PikFan	[[Bulborb Larva]]
2014-08-13 22:15:08	Testyo	"Bulborb_Larva" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Bulborb_Larva
2014-08-13 22:15:23	@Espyo	what about?
2014-08-13 22:15:45	@PikFan	this is random, but the Bulborb Larva's species is different than others
2014-08-13 22:15:48	@J	I wasn't telling you to ping chanserv, I was trying to do so
2014-08-13 22:15:52	@J	and failed so much
2014-08-13 22:15:54	@Espyo	pffft
2014-08-13 22:16:11	@Espyo	PikFan: the family?
2014-08-13 22:16:14	@J	anyway, that edit doesn't give any evidence
2014-08-13 22:16:18	@PikFan	it's oculus bambinii
2014-08-13 22:16:32	@Espyo	that's the scientific name
2014-08-13 22:16:43	@PikFan	well yes
2014-08-13 22:16:47	@Espyo	well, it's better than "high-pitched horns" and "low-pitched horns"
2014-08-13 22:16:54	@Espyo	I'll listen to some samples on youtube
2014-08-13 22:16:57	@J	not if it's just made up
2014-08-13 22:17:12	@PikFan	bambinii is different than kageyamii
2014-08-13 22:17:26	@J	it doesn't need to be specific unless the game actually mentions it
2014-08-13 22:17:30	@Espyo	the horns are made up too
2014-08-13 22:17:49	@PikFan	so that's implying that the Larva is its /own/ species
2014-08-13 22:18:05	@J	so you say 'they sound like horns, one high- and one low-pitched', or something
2014-08-13 22:18:16	@J	it puts across everything you're trying to say
2014-08-13 22:18:56	@Espyo	but
2014-08-13 22:19:01	@Espyo	hmm
2014-08-13 22:19:17	@Espyo	is the species always the second name of a scientific name?
2014-08-13 22:19:26	@PikFan	yeah
2014-08-13 22:19:33	@Espyo	I guess, but horns and wooden instruments are kind of different
2014-08-13 22:19:33	@PikFan	it's genus, then species
2014-08-13 22:19:58	@PikFan	or, in the case of [[Red Bulborb]], genus, species, and subspecies
2014-08-13 22:19:59	Testyo	"Red_Bulborb" article = http://www.pikminwiki.com/index.php?title=Red_Bulborb
2014-08-13 22:20:14	@Espyo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9WAwyBqWgg yep, doesn't really sound like the President
2014-08-13 22:20:29	@Espyo	hm, I see what you mean
2014-08-13 22:20:51	@Espyo	though pretty sure this is just the case of Nintendo being silly and making up silly names
2014-08-13 22:20:57	@Espyo	bambinni is Italian for kids
2014-08-13 22:21:05	@Espyo	*Bambinii
2014-08-13 22:21:38	@PikFan	it'd still make good trivia, though
2014-08-13 22:22:06	@Espyo	yeah
2014-08-13 22:22:09	@Espyo	oh, I forgot to say
2014-08-13 22:22:15	@Espyo	but because we're a wiki, we have to take everything as canon
2014-08-13 22:23:35	@PikFan	wait, @me or @J?
2014-08-13 22:24:31	@Espyo	@you
2014-08-13 22:24:55	@Espyo	(if @ means op in IRC, then us three really are @)
2014-08-13 22:25:14	@PikFan	(heh)
2014-08-13 22:25:22	@PikFan	but I'm confused
2014-08-13 22:26:45	@Espyo	they didn't follow the genus/species/sub thing strictly
2014-08-13 22:27:02	@Espyo	so the Larvae's name is just a silly technical name
2014-08-13 22:27:04	@PikFan	hmm
2014-08-13 22:27:06	@Espyo	made for sillyness
2014-08-13 22:27:12	@Espyo	but we have to take it seriously
2014-08-13 22:27:15	@PikFan	but
2014-08-13 22:27:17	@PikFan	logic
2014-08-13 22:27:18	@Espyo	and call it a different species
2014-08-13 22:27:31	@Espyo	maybe they ARE meant to be different species
2014-08-13 22:27:38	@Espyo	the Bulborb Larvae are actually parasites
2014-08-13 22:28:05	@PikFan	...?
2014-08-13 22:28:06	@Espyo	some Grub-dog species has some method of infecting Empress Bulblaxes
2014-08-13 22:28:18	@Espyo	replaces her eggs with "occulus bambinii" eggs
2014-08-13 22:28:21	@Espyo	and she births them
2014-08-13 22:28:29	@Espyo	the Larvae are not her original offspring
2014-08-13 22:28:36	@PikFan	oh
2014-08-13 22:28:36	@PikFan	OH
2014-08-13 22:28:54	@PikFan	yeah, because they're also different from Empress Bulblaxes
2014-08-13 22:29:24	@Espyo	well, it's soon to say, but maybe
2014-08-13 22:29:28	@Espyo	soon because they're infants
2014-08-13 22:29:33	Meisterbot	i looked at my pc
2014-08-13 22:29:44	Meisterbot	and the first thing i see is the word birth
2014-08-13 22:30:06	@Espyo	hehe
2014-08-13 22:30:17	@PikFan	hah
2014-08-13 22:30:17	Meisterbot	*claps*
2014-08-13 22:30:18	@Espyo	but yeah, it's canon

2014-08-13 22:30:26	@Espyo	...not my parasite theory

2014-08-15 20:14:40	@J	...oh, so that's why my Raspberry Pi ran out of memory a couple of times: an update changed a config file and reset the memory split setting so the GPU is using more of it than before
2014-08-15 20:15:46	@J	I should wait until I get back before trying to reboot, in case there's a problem
2014-08-15 20:16:47	@J	hmm, if you have Firefox set to 'Never remember history', you can't clear history
2014-08-15 20:17:13	@J	and it just took about 10 minutes to clear all my history

2014-08-15 20:30:50	@Espyo	that's a bit dumb
2014-08-15 20:30:59	@Espyo	unless "never" really means never
2014-08-15 20:31:12	@Espyo	why would you clear your history, anyway?
